THEY HAD COME UP TO THE HELP OF JEHOVAH AGAINST THE MIGHTY TRIBAL PATRIOTISM THE MEMORY OF PAST GRIEVANCES THE DESIRE FOR PLUNDER AND ZEAL FOR JEHOVAH THE GOD WHO HAD LED THEIR FOREFATHERS THROUGH THE WILDERNESS INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN STIRRED THEIR COURAGE AND FIRED THEM TO DEEDS OF VALOR

AND IT LASTED UNTIL THE TRIBES BROKE UP INTO CLANS AND FAMILIES WHEN THEY ACQUIRED PERMANENT HOMES AND BECAME AGRICULTURISTS IN THE LAND OF CANAAN
THE PRINCIPLE OF GENERATION OCCUPIED SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE IN THE CANAANITE CULTS THAT IN TIME THEY BECAME EXCEEDINGLY IMMORAL AND DEBASING
THIS WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD GRASPED UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES

FROM MY STUDY OF THE CONDITIONS IN AMERICA AND OF THE NEEDS IN CHINA I AM CONVINCED THAT THE SABBATH IS A MOST VALUABLE AND ESSENTIAL INSTITUTION LATER JUDAISM REVIVED THE EARLIER HEATHEN CONTENT OF THE SABBATH AND LOST SIGHT OF ITS DEEPER POLITICAL SOCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN SIGNIFICANCE
IN EACH OF THE ACCOUNTS THE CHARACTER OF NOAH STANDS IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
WHAT IS A SNOB
DISEMBARKING THE BABYLONIAN NOAH KISSED THE EARTH AND AFTER BUILDING AN ALTAR OFFERED A SACRIFICE TO THE GODS
HERE AM I LIKEWISE IN THE LATE PRIESTLY STORY GOD'S PRESENCE AND CHARACTER WERE SO DEEPLY IMPRESSED UPON HIM THAT HE SEEMED TO BEAR AN AUDIBLE VOICE ACCORDING TO THE VIEW OF THOSE WHO ACCEPT THIS INTERPRETATION EVEN THOUGH THE LATER PRIESTS BELIEVED AND TAUGHT THAT GOD WAS A SPIRIT NOT LIKE MAN CLOTHED IN FLESH AND BLOOD
THAT THE HEBREWS MIGHT NOT FORGET THIS OBLIGATION THE PROPHETS APPEALED TO THE MEMORY OF THE DAYS WHEN THE ISRAELITES THEMSELVES WERE SLAVES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT AND THE THOUGHT OF HOW JEHOVAH DELIVERED THEM FROM THEIR SLAVERY
IS MAN'S POSSESSION OF KNOWLEDGE AND POWER THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF CREATION

THOREAU DECLINED TO PAY A TAX THAT HE BELIEVED UNJUST AND ACCEPTED HIS PUNISHMENT DECLARING THAT IF HE PAID THE PENALTY HE MIGHT THUS AROUSE PUBLIC SENTIMENT AND SECURE THE REPEAL OF THE LAW
THUS EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OR GROUP OF WRITERS MADE ABRAHAM AS THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF THEIR RACE THE EMBODIMENT OF THEIR HIGHEST IDEALS
THE EVER RECURRING COMPLAINT OF EMPLOYERS IS THE SCARCITY OF GOOD MEN ESPECIALLY OF MEN ABLE TO EXERCISE DISCRETION IN POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY

FOR THEIR GUIDANCE ARE ALSO PROVIDED SUBJECTS FOR FURTHER STUDY

INCIDENTALLY IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HEBREWS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MOABITES ACROSS THE JORDAN AND THE DEAD SEA FOR LOT IN THESE EARLIER STORIES STANDS AS THE TRADITIONAL ANCESTOR OF THE MOABITES AND AMMONITES
THE NUMBER FORTY IN THE BIBLE IS THE CONCRETE HEBREW EQUIVALENT OF MANY
24-27 WHAT NOBLE VIRTUES DOES ESAU POSSESS

THE GROWING NUMBERS AND STRENGTH OF THE ISRAELITES AT LAST ALARMED THE CANAANITES
ON THE EVE OF BATTLE A DRENCHING THUNDERSTORM SEEMS TO HAVE SWEPT ACROSS THE ALLUVIAL PLAIN TRANSFORMING IT INTO A MORASS AND THE SLUGGISH KISHON INTO A RUSHING UNFORDABLE RIVER

NOW THESE ARE THE LAWS OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY AND MIGHTY ARE THEY

EVEN JESUS DISCIPLES ON SEEING A BLIND MAN BY THE WAYSIDE RAISED THE QUESTION

THE STORY OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN GEN
THE CHARACTER OF THE RUINS TO-DAY DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THEY WERE EVER SURROUNDED BY FORMIDABLE WALLS
ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES SAID THAT THE MAN WHO GUIDES HIS LIFE BY THE MAXIM HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY IS IN REALITY NOT HONEST AT HEART IT MUST NEVERTHELESS BE GRANTED THAT IN BUSINESS THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST MEANS THE SURVIVAL OF THE MOST HONEST BUSINESS MAN
EMIGRATION AND PIONEERING ARE THUS A NORMAL OUTGROWTH OF A PROGRESSIVE GROWING PEOPLE IN ANY STAGE OF CIVILIZATION
IN CHINA WHERE TO-DAY FAR MORE THAN IN THE WEST THERE EXISTS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NEIGHBORS THOSE WHO FAIL TO EXERT THE PROPER INFLUENCE OVER THE CHARACTER AND CONDUCT OF A CRIMINAL NEIGHBOR OFTEN HAVE THEIR HOUSES RAZED TO THE GROUND AND THE SITES SOWN WITH SALT
THE HEBREW MONTH WAS ALSO THE LUNAR MONTH OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-EIGHT DAYS
EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT IS THAT NOBLE AMBITION COUPLED WITH HEROIC PERSEVERANCE THAT HAS ENABLED SETTLEMENT WORKERS TO BRING LIGHT TO THE DARKEST PARTS OF OUR GREAT CITIES
THE OLDEST VERSION OF THE STORY THEY BELIEVE IS FOUND IN 26:1-14 AND IS TOLD NOT OF ABRAHAM BUT OF ISAAC WHOSE CHARACTER IT FITS FAR MORE CONSISTENTLY

ALONG THIS HIGHWAY WENT THE HEBREW TRIBES LATER KNOWN AS THE EPHRAIMITES AND MANASSITES

MAY THE WOMAN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN BE REGARDED AS THE PROTOTYPE OF THE MODERN SCIENTIST
AT LAST THE SHIP APPROACHED THE MOUNTAIN NISIR WHICH LAY ON THE NORTHERN HORIZON AS VIEWED FROM THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES VALLEY
THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE EARLIEST ACCOUNT OF THE INITIAL CONQUEST NOW FOUND IN JUDGES 1 IS CHIEFLY DEVOTED TO RECOUNTING THE STRONG CANAANITE CITIES WHICH THE HEBREWS FAILED TO CONQUER
JESUS WITH HIS CLEAR INSIGHT INTO HUMAN HEARTS AND NEEDS AND WITH HIS GLOWING LOVE FOR MEN REPUDIATED THE HARSH MECHANICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SABBATH CURRENT IN HIS DAY AND REASSERTED THE TEACHINGS OF THE GREAT PROPHETS THAT PRECEDED HIM
APPARENTLY THEIR REBELLIOUS ATTITUDE ALSO INCREASED THE BURDEN WHICH WAS PLACED UPON THEM
THE LATER PROSE VERSION OF THE INCIDENT FOUND IN JUDGES 4 SUPPLEMENTS THE EARLIER POEM
ISRAEL'S EARLY FAITH WAS SIMPLE LIKE THAT OF A LITTLE CHILD
IT IS INTERESTING AND ILLUMINATING TO NOTE HOW THE ANCIENT HEBREW PROPHETS IN THEIR RELIGIOUS TEACHING FORECAST THE DISCOVERIES AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF OUR DAY
WHEN THE FULLY DEVELOPED MAN FAILS AS DID JACOB TO LEAVE BEHIND CHILDISH THINGS AND RETAINS THE AMBITIONS AND IMPULSES OF THE CHILD HIS CONDITION IS PITIABLE
EVERY CRIMINAL ACT IS ANTI-SOCIAL
DISOBEDIENCE OR DISRESPECT HO PARENTS HAS NO LONGER A LEGAL PENALTY ALTHOUGH THE CHILDREN MAY BE COMPELLED BY LAW TO SUPPORT THEIR PARENTS
THE MOUNTAIN IN THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT IS IDENTIFIED WITH MOUNT ARARAT

LIKE MOST OF THE CANAANITE CITIES IT WAS SITUATED ON A SLIGHTLY RISING EMINENCE CLOSE TO THE FOOTHILLS THAT ON THE WEST ROSE ABRUPTLY TO THE CENTRAL PLATEAU OF CANAAN
WERE OUR REVOLUTIONARY FOREFATHERS RIGHT IN RESISTING THE DEMANDS OF KING GEORGE
IN THE LIGHT OF THESE FACTS WOULD IT NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT CAIN'S CHARACTER AND CONDUCT ARE THE REASON WHY HIS OFFERING WAS NOT ACCEPTED
DID MOSES SHOW HIMSELF A COWARD IN FLEEING FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT
THEY ARGUE THAT LATER GENERATIONS FAMILIAR WITH THE BARRENNESS OF THE WILDERNESS AND BELIEVING THAT THE HEBREWS AT THIS TIME NUMBERED MANY THOUSANDS NATURALLY CONCLUDED AND REPORTED THAT THEIR ANCESTORS WERE MIRACULOUSLY FED
HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P-ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
WAS IT NATURAL
WHATEVER THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT MAY BE WHETHER MONARCHY OR DEMOCRACY IT MUST ULTIMATELY REST UPON THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE SHAPING OF THAT WILL IS OFTEN A STATESMAN'S TASK
BRYCE JAMES THE AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH VOLS
EVERY EARLY PEOPLE NATURALLY ASKED THE QUESTIONS HOW WERE THINGS MADE
IS IT PROFITABLE TO TEACH THEM TO CHILDREN TO-DAY
EMERSON ESSAY ON CHARACTER
WHILE ITS BELIEFS WERE CRUDE ITS TRUST WAS STRONG
HE WILL NOT KILL NOR HURT ANY LIVING CREATURE NEEDLESSLY BUT WILL STRIVE TO SAVE AND PROTECT ALL HARMLESS LIFE IS THIS A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE TEACHING IN GENESIS 1
IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT THE DATA REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN THE WILDERNESS ARE LATE AND EXCEEDINGLY VAGUE
THE JUDGE MUST ADAPT A LAW MADE BY ONE GENERATION TO THE NEEDS OF THE NEXT
OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS 92-94 395
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN JESUS ATTITUDE TOWARD SIN AND TOWARD THE SINNER
DOES YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEART OF MAN CONFIRM THE INSIGHT OF THE PROPHET WHO SPEAKS THROUGH THE WONDERFUL STORY OF GENESIS 3
WHAT NATURAL IMPULSES IMPELLED THE WOMAN TO DISOBEY THE DIVINE COMMAND
2 THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE DEAD SEA VALLEY
THE BIBLE HAS SUCH POWER FOR TEACHING RIGHTEOUSNESS THAT EVEN TO THOSE WHO COME TO IT WITH ALL SORTS OF FALSE NOTIONS ABOUT THE GOD OF THE BIBLE IT YET TEACHES RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FILLS THEM WITH THE LOVE OF IT
THE HEBREWS LONG CONTINUED TO RETAIN IN THEIR HOMES THE FAMILY IMAGES INHERITED FROM THEIR SEMITIC ANCESTORS
IF EDUCATION HAS BEEN FOSTERED ACCORDING TO THE BEST LIGHTS OF EACH GENERATION SINCE THEN
EVEN MORE DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED IS THE SO-CALLED THEORY OF EVOLUTION WHICH IS BASED ON THE CAREFUL OBSERVATION AND COMPARISON OF COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF NATURAL PHENOMENA
IF SO HOW DID THE CALL COME
HIS KINGDOM OF GOD LIKEWISE IS NOT TERRITORIAL
A CORRUPT LAWYER HAS SOMETIMES BECOME AN UPRIGHT JUDGE
WHEN THEREFORE PHARAOH HEARD THIS THING HE SOUGHT TO HIM MOSES
DO YOU INTEND TO KILL ME AS YOU KILLED THE EGYPTIAN
REMOVE FAR FROM ME FALSEHOOD AND LIES
THE DIVERSIFIED PHYSICAL CONTOUR OF PALESTINE LIKEWISE STRENGTHENED THIS TENDENCY TOWARD SEPARATION RATHER THAN UNITY
FISKE LODGE BANCROFT OR OTHER WRITERS ON THIS PERIOD
UNCONSCIOUSLY THEY JOIN THE GREAT ARMY OF THE DRIFTERS OR FOLLOWERS WHO PRESERVE THE TRADITIONS OF THE PAST BUT CONTRIBUTE LITTLE TO THE FUTURE PROGRESS OF THE RACE
DO PEOPLE SO INTERPRET THE DESTRUCTION OF SAN FRANCISCO AND MESSINA
CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THESE TWO VARIANT BIBLICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE FLOOD ARE THE TWO BABYLONIAN VERSIONS WHICH HAVE FORTUNATELY BEEN ALMOST WHOLLY RECOVERED
ZEBULUN WAS A PEOPLE WHO EXPOSED THEMSELVES TO DEADLY PERIL AND NAPHTALI ON THE HEIGHTS OF THE OPEN FIELD

A RADICAL CHANGE IN PUBLIC OPINION IS NOW TAKING PLACE
DIFFERENT THEORIES OF CREATION
WHAT OTHER GREAT LEADERS OF ISRAEL WERE TRAINED IN THIS SAME SCHOOL
IN THE ORIENT THE MOTHER STANDS IN ESPECIALLY CLOSE RELATION TO THE SON
THEREFORE HIS NAME WAS CALLED EDOM RED BUT JACOB SAID SELL ME FIRST OF ALL YOUR BIRTHRIGHT
ECONOMICALLY THEY ARE OF GREATER VALUE TO SOCIETY THAN THE DRIFTER
ASKALON IS CARRIED INTO CAPTIVITY GEZER IS TAKEN
THEN JEHOVAH SAID TO NOAH ENTER THOU AND ALL THY HOUSE INTO THE ARK
OR WHEN THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT SHOULD AN INDIVIDUAL EVER ATTEMPT TO PUNISH CRIME OR AVENGE PERSONAL WRONG
BUT THE CENTRIFUGAL TRIBE SPIRIT FOR A TIME PROVED THE STRONGER
THE FORM OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PART EXPLAINS THE COMMANDING PLACE WHICH THEY STILL HOLD IN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
BIBLE ALL THINGS WERE MADE THROUGH HIM
THE PICTURE IN GENESIS 3 CLEARLY IMPLIES THAT GOD'S INTENTION WAS NOT THAT MAN SHOULD SUFFER BUT THAT HE SHOULD ENJOY PERFECT HEALTH AND HAPPINESS
THE OTHER TOWNS ULTIMATELY CAPTURED BY THE SOUTHERN TRIBES WERE HEBRON WITH ITS COPIOUS WATER SUPPLY DEBIR TO THE SOUTHWEST AND ARAD AND HORMAH WHICH LAY ON THE BORDERS OF THE SOUTH COUNTRY
EVERY TYPE OF SELFISHNESS IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO A MAN'S HIGHEST SELF-INTEREST
IS TEMPTATION NECESSARY FOR MAN'S MORAL DEVELOPMENT
A BRIEF SUMMARY WILL INDICATE THE TRANSITION TO THE NEXT PERIOD THAT OF THE KINGDOM
MENTION SOME BIOGRAPHIES THAT YOU CONSIDER OF THE GREATEST HELP
WHY DID THE MAN AND WOMAN TRY TO EXCUSE THEIR DISOBEDIENCE
THE SECOND FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF THE DECALOGUE DEAL WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF MAN TO MAN
DOES SIN BRING MORAL ENLIGHTENMENT
IN THE LATER VERSIONS OF THE STORY JEHOVAH INSCRIBES THEM WITH HIS OWN FINGERS ON THE TWO TABLETS WHICH HE GAVE TO MOSES
JEHOVAH SPAKE TO MOSES FACE TO FACE AS A MAN SPEAKETH UNTO HIS FRIEND--EX
MANY A MAN HAS ENJOYED THE CONFIDENCE AND RESPECT OF HIS ASSOCIATES UNTIL HIS ABILITIES HAVE WON FOR HIM LARGE WEALTH WITH WHICH APPARENTLY COMES AT TIMES A MISLEADING SENSE OF IMMUNITY FROM THE ORDINARY MORAL OBLIGATIONS
HE SUFFERS BUT HE WILL NOT SUFFER LONG
EVERY STATESMAN OF MODERN TIMES AS WELL AS THOSE OF BYGONE DAYS MUST HAVE THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE GENUINELY AT HEART IF HE IS TO BE IN THE BEST SENSE OF THE WORD SUCCESSFUL
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL
AND HE MANAGED TO CHECK HIS WILD FLIGHT AND LOOK ABOUT HIM
ACCORDING TO THIS ACCOUNT THE TREE OF LIFE WAS PLANTED IN THE GARDEN THAT MAN WHILE HE LIVED THERE MIGHT ENJOY IMMORTALITY
THIS FACT WAS SO FULLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PATRIARCHAL STAGE OF SOCIETY THAT THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY WITHIN THE TRIBE HAD THE POWER EVEN OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD

THE LOVE BETWEEN THE SEXES IS APPARENTLY IMPLANTED IN ALL LIVING BEINGS PRIMARILY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES BUT THE EARLY PROPHET ALSO RECOGNIZED CLEARLY THE BROADER INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL ASPECTS OF THE RELATION

BUT THEY SOON LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE THIRSTY DESERT
IN THE WILDERNESS THEY ALSO LEARNED THE ART OF NOMADIC WARFARE WHICH TO WIN VICTORIES DEPENDED NOT SO MUCH UPON OPEN ATTACK AS UPON STRATEGY
SOMETIMES MEN PROMINENT IN RELIGIOUS WORK BECOME DEFAULTERS OR COMMIT OTHER CRIMES
THIS ONE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN FOR FROM MAN WAS SHE TAKEN WHAT FUNDAMENTAL EXPLANATION IS HERE GIVEN OF THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE
MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRIBE DISAPPEAR ALMOST ENTIRELY AS WANDERING NOMADS SETTLE IN A FIXED ABODE AND THE PATRIARCHAL RULE CHANGES TO THAT OF A ROYAL OR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
THE CANAANITE CIVILIZATION
THE CANAANITE CIVILIZATION
THE TRIBAL ORGANIZATION ALSO CHERISHED THE FREEDOM OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
NOTHING ELSE STIRS THE WORST OF HUMAN PASSIONS AS DOES SEXUAL JEALOUSY
THE WILDERNESS LEFT A STAMP UPON HEBREW CHARACTER AND LIFE THAT MAY BE TRACED EVEN TO-DAY IN THE LATER DESCENDANTS OF THAT RACE
MOST PRIMITIVE PEOPLES DEFINED IT AS FAILURE TO PERFORM CERTAIN CEREMONIAL ACTS OR TO BRING TRIBUTE TO THE GODS
MAY THE CHRISTIAN BELIEVE THAT THIS NEW SENSE OF NEARNESS AND LOVE TO GOD IS MET BY A CORRESPONDING FEELING ON GOD'S PART
WHAT PROPORTION OF THE VOTERS IN YOUR VOTING DISTRICT ACTUALLY STUDY AND APPRECIATE THE ISSUES IN EACH ELECTION
1:1-7:5 1
TO-DAY AS IN THE DISTANT PAST THE INHABITANTS OF THE DESERTS FROM WHENCE CAME THE FOREFATHERS OF THE HEBREWS MAKE THEIR JOURNEYS UNDER THE CLEAR COOL LIGHT OF THE MOON AVOIDING THE HOT PIERCING RAYS OF THE MID-DAY SUN
AND HE SAID TO THE ONE WHO WAS DOING THE WRONG WHY DO YOU SMITE YOUR FELLOW-WORKMAN
COMPARE THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRIMINAL INSTINCTS IN SHAKESPEARE'S MACBETH
THEN HE CREATED THE ANIMALS AND THEIR YOUNG
IF THE WHOLE LAND HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM A WILDERNESS INTO A GARDEN OF PLENTY FROM OCEAN TO OCEAN
IN WHAT PRACTICAL WAYS MAY A MAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE HAPPINESS AND ENNOBLING OF HIS FELLOW MEN
12:1-12 31 32
THESE RECTANGULAR CHAMBERS WERE OF VARIOUS SIZES AND WERE SURROUNDED BY WALLS TWO OR THREE YARDS IN THICKNESS
IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH CLEARLY BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND THE OFFICIAL ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CRIMINAL
WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS HABIT
HOLD OUT--PATIENCE IS GENIUS
THIS CONCLUSION IS POSSIBLE AND IN MANY WAYS ATTRACTIVE BUT IT IS BESET WITH SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES
IS THERE ANY TRACE IN HIS LATER YEARS OF THE SELFISH AMBITION WHICH EARLIER DOMINATED HIM
LOYALTY TO JEHOVAH WAS NOT ONLY THE CORNER STONE OF ISRAEL'S RELIGION BUT ALSO OF THE HEBREW STATE
THE SAME CRUDE METHOD OF AVENGING WRONGS IS FOUND IN THE VENDETTA OF ITALY AND THE FAMILY FEUDS IN CERTAIN SPARSELY SETTLED REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
A SCOUT IS KIND
DOES THIS PRINCIPLE MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY MAN HOWEVER LIMITED HIS ABILITY AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTAIN REAL SUCCESS
AS THIS LOOSELY ASSOCIATED GROUP CONDENSES INTO THE TRIBE ALL THE MEMBERS OF WHICH REGARD THEMSELVES AS DESCENDED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR THE ORGANIZATION BECOMES MUCH MORE DEFINITE UNDER A PATRIARCHAL RULER
THE LOVE OF JUSTICE IS SIMPLY IN THE MAJORITY OF MEN THE FEAR OF SUFFERING INJUSTICE THE INSTINCT OF PRESERVATION AND SHEER NECESSITY COMPEL THE PEOPLE ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF THEIR LEADER
HOW MUCH OF ENGLAND'S GREATNESS MAY BE TRACED TO THE QUIET INFLUENCE OF ARNOLD OF RUGBY
IN THE NORTHERN ISRAELITE VERSION THE MOMENT OF DECISION CAME TO HIM AS HE STOOD WITH HIS FLOCK ON THE SACRED MOUNTAIN HOREB
THE RULES SEEM GENERALLY TO BE LARGELY THE PRODUCT OF INSTINCT OR OF EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ANY LAW MAKING AND THEY ARE ENFORCED ALMOST AS INSTINCTIVELY BY THE COMMON CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE
THIS IS A COMMON EXPERIENCE IN ALL LANDS AND AGES
HIS CHOICE OF THE FERTILE PLAIN OF THE JORDAN HAD BROUGHT HIM INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH ITS INHABITANTS THE CANAANITES
DO YOU THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF TO-DAY ARE RECREANT IN THEIR RESPECT FOR OR ADHERENCE TO LAW
FOR THEY WERE A SHEPHERDLESS FLOCK IN THE MIDST OF WOLVES
ITS INHABITANTS WERE SLAIN AS A GREAT SACRIFICIAL OFFERING TO JEHOVAH WHOSE TRUE CHARACTER AS ONE WHO LOVES ALL MANKIND WAS FIRST APPRECIATED BY THE INSPIRED PROPHETS OF A MUCH LATER FROM THE PLAIN OF JERICHO TWO OR THREE ROADS LED UP TO THE CENTRAL PLATEAU OF CANAAN
THE SAME DURATION IS SUGGESTED BY THE PRIESTLY WRITER IN NUMBERS 26:57-59
WHAT PROPORTION DRIFT OR TAKE THE WAY SHOWN THEM BY OTHERS
THE INSTITUTION OF THE SABBATH IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES APPARENTLY HAS A LONG AND COMPLEX HISTORY
IF A MEMBER OF THE GROUP HAS MET WITH A MISFORTUNE IN A CERTAIN BY-PATH OR FROM EATING CERTAIN FOOD OR IN OTHER WAYS BY THE ACTION OF THE LEADER OF HIS GROUP THAT PATH OR THAT FOOD BECOMES TABOO AND FROM THAT TIME ON IT IS FORBIDDEN

IS YOUR COMMUNITY GROWING BETTER
DOES TEMPTATION APPEAL IN A DIFFERENT FORM TO EACH INDIVIDUAL
THUS THE INDIVIDUAL IN LATER EVEN MORE THAN IN EARLIER TIMES OBEYS THE LAWS NOT MERELY FROM SELFISH BUT FROM SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS MOTIVES
BUT AS SOCIETY GROWS MORE AND MORE HUMANE THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR THE WELFARE OF HIS FELLOWS GROWS UNTIL IN THE BEST SOCIETY LAWS ARE MADE AND OBEYED BY MOST CITIZENS NOT FROM A SENSE OF FEAR OF PUNISHMENT BUT MAINLY OUT OF GOODWILL TO OTHERS

THE LOCAL GOVERNORS OF PALESTINE REFER TO HIM IN TERMS WHICH SUGGEST THAT HIS AUTHORITY WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF PHARAOH HIMSELF
DO THESE VARIANT VERSIONS INDICATE THAT THEY WERE DRAWN FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS OF NARRATIVES
THESE LAWS ARE SO INVARIABLE THAT THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED UNCHANGING
THE GREAT EPIDEMIC OF CHOLERA IN HAMBURG IN 1892 WAS CLEARLY THE RESULT OF A GROSS NEGLECT OF SANITARY PRECAUTIONS IN REGARD TO THE WATER SUPPLY
THE CRIMINALS ARE PUNISHED NOT FOR THE MERE SAKE OF THE PUNISHMENT OR FOR VENGEANCE BUT TO DETER THEM FROM FURTHER CRIME OR TO SERVE AS A WARNING TO OTHERS
WAS HE JUSTIFIED IN THE MEASURES TAKEN

IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN'S LOYALTY TO PARENTS IT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED BY SCIENTISTS THAT THE PLACE OF ANIMALS IN THE SCALE OF BEING IS DEPENDENT UPON THE LENGTH OF THEIR PERIOD OF INFANCY
THE GREAT CRISIS IN MOSES EARLY MANHOOD CAME WHEN HE WOKE TO A REALIZATION OF HIS KINSHIP WITH THE DESPISED AND OPPRESSED SERFS AND AN APPRECIATION OF THE CRUEL INJUSTICE OF WHICH THEY WERE THE HELPLESS VICTIMS
2 CONDITIONS IN CANAAN AT THE TIME OF THE HEBREW SETTLEMENT
THAT LOVE AND THAT CARE NEVER CEASE TOWARD EVEN THE MOST DEPRAVED
MEN BY THEIR SINS AND WILFUL FAILURE TO OBSERVE HIS BENIGN LAWS WERE THWARTING THAT PURPOSE
THROUGH THE AGES THE INHABITANTS OF THE PARCHED STONY WILDERNESS HAD LOOKED WITH HUNGRY EYES UPON THE TREE-CLAD HILLS AND GREEN FIELDS OF PALESTINE
WHEN THE FLOOD SUBSIDES HOWEVER A COVENANT IS CONCLUDED AND IS SEALED BY THE RAINBOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH MAN'S COMMISSION TO RULE OVER ALL OTHER LIVING THINGS IS RENEWED AND DIVINE PERMISSION IS GIVEN TO EACH TO EAT OF THE FLESH OF ANIMALS PROVIDED ONLY THAT MEN CAREFULLY ABSTAIN FROM EATING THE BLOOD

THE OTHER THAT OF THE MAN WHO KNOWS LIFE AND WHO REALIZES THE MEANING AND VALUE OF THE BIBLE TO THOSE WHO ARE CONFRONTED BY INSISTENT SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS
A MOST HOPEFUL ELEMENT IN THE PRESENT SITUATION IS THAT MANY OF THE WORLD'S WEALTHIEST MEN ARE PROCLAIMING THEIR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY IN WAYS BOTH PRACTICAL AND IMPRESSIVE
IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPRESS UPON THE CHILD IN THIS CONCRETE WAY CERTAIN OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS TO GOD AND MAN
THE STORY IS TOLD OF THE LATE PRESIDENT GARFIELD THAT IN THE HEAT OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS SUGGESTED THAT HE ADOPT AN EXCEEDINGLY QUESTIONABLE POLICY

WHEN YOU MEET ONE OF THESE MEN OR WOMEN BE TO THEM A DIVINE MAN
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE STRIKING POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE FLOOD STORIES OF PEOPLES FAR REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER
IT IS NATURAL AND INEVITABLE THAT THE VARIOUS SOCIAL CLASSES OF EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION SHOULD DEFINE THEIR STANDARDS OF SUCCESS CONCRETELY THAT IS BY THE LIVES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE DONE GREAT THINGS
HOLD FAST
THEY PRESERVE ALSO THE CHARACTERISTIC POPULAR RECORD OF THE EARLY MIGRATIONS WHICH BROUGHT THESE PEOPLES TO PALESTINE WHERE THEY CRYSTALIZED INTO THE DIFFERENT NATIONS THAT FIGURE IN THE DRAMA OF ISRAEL'S HISTORY
DOES THE GREAT BODY OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH TO-DAY ACCEPT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPHETS AND OF JESUS OR THAT OF EARLY HEATHENISM AND LATER JUDAISM
AND JEHOVAH WAS WITH JOSEPH AND SHOWED KINDNESS TO HIM AND GAVE HIM FAVOR IN THE SIGHT OF THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON SO THAT THE KEEPER OF THE PRISON GAVE TO JOSEPH'S CHARGE ALL THE PRISONERS WHO WERE IN THE PRISON AND FOR WHATEVER THEY DID HE WAS RESPONSIBLE
CREATED MAN IN HIS IMAGE CAN NOT MEAN WITH A BODY LIKE THAT OF GOD FOR IN THIS STORY GOD IS THOUGHT OF AS A SPIRIT BUT RATHER WITH A GOD-LIKE SPIRIT MIND WILL AND POWER TO RULE

IT WAS A CONSTRUCTION OF EXCELLENT WORKMANSHIP WHICH STILL STANDS PRACTICALLY INTACT TESTIFYING TO THE ACCURACY OF THE EARLY HEBREW TRADITION
HE MUST SEE HOW FAR HE CAN GO WITHOUT AROUSING TOO MUCH OPPOSITION
ARE THESE DIFFERENCES DUE TO THE PECULIAR GENIUS OF EACH RACE OR IN PART TO THE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY THE IDEALS THUS CONCRETELY PRESENTED UPON EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION
AT THIS POINT ISRAEL'S HISTORY AS A NATION PROPERLY BEGINS ALTHOUGH THE COMPLETE UNION OF THE TRIBES WAS NOT CONSUMMATED UNTIL NEARLY A CENTURY LATER

THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS DIRECT WAY WAS FORCED TO RECOGNIZE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND TO GRANT THEIR REQUESTS
IT WAS THIS TRUST AND LOYALTY THAT CARRIED THE CHILD NATION THROUGH ITS EARLY CRISES AND ULTIMATELY BOUND TOGETHER THE SEPARATE TRIBES INTO A UNITED COMMONWEALTH
2 FOR DESTRUCTION AS WHEN A MAN CALLS DOWN A CURSE UPON ANOTHER
THIS COMMAND IS LIKE IN KIND TO THAT OF JESUS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT WHERE ALL THE COMMANDMENTS ARE SUMMED UP INTO ONE
WAS IT RIGHT FOR THE ABOLITIONISTS TO VIOLATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW
YET AS ONE OF OUR GREAT JUDGES HAS LATELY EXPLAINED IN PRACTICALLY ALL STAGES OF SOCIETY WHENEVER THE POPULATION BECOMES NUMEROUS AND BUSINESS IS SO DEVELOPED THAT WE MAY RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT CLASSES IN A COMMUNITY LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PRIMARILY IN THE INTERESTS OF A RULING CLASS OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER CLASSES
WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT ARISTOTLE WHO IS PERHAPS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST THINKER ASSOCIATED WITH HIS GREAT TEACHER PLATO TWENTY YEARS UNTIL HE WAS THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AND PRODUCED NEARLY ALL HIS IMPORTANT WORKS ONLY AFTER THAT TIME WE MAY SEE ONE EXAMPLE OF THE PROFOUND IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING

THE PERMANENT AND UNIVERSAL VALUE OF THESE STORIES LIES HOWEVER IN THE GREAT MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY VIVIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY ILLUSTRATE
T I 360-9
EVEN MORE INSISTENT THAN THE CONSTANT STRUGGLE FOR FOOD AND WATER WERE THE DANGERS THAT CAME FROM THE HOSTILE TRIBES WHICH ALREADY OCCUPIED THIS MUCH-CONTESTED TERRITORY

FROM THEIR EARLY NOMADIC LIFE THEY INHERITED PHYSICAL STRENGTH HARDIHOOD ADAPTABILITY EVEN TO THE MOST UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT COURAGE PERSEVERANCE AND THAT INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE AND SELF-RELIANCE WHICH COME FROM PROTRACTED STRUGGLES AGAINST SEEMINGLY INSUPERABLE ODDS

TO SECURE THE FAVOR OF THEIR GODS THE CANAANITES BROUGHT RICH SACRIFICES TO THEIR ALTARS AND OBSERVED CERTAIN GREAT ANNUAL FESTIVALS WITH CEREMONIES VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE LATER ADOPTED BY THE HEBREWS
EACH INDIVIDUAL THROWN UPON HIS OWN RESOURCES LEARNS TO THINK AND QUESTION AND JUDGE
IF GOD'S PURPOSE IS TO MAKE EVERYTHING GOOD MAN'S HIGHEST PRIVILEGE AS WELL AS DUTY IS TO CO-OPERATE WITH HIM IN REALIZING THAT PURPOSE
HOW DID IT DIFFER FROM THAT OF ABRAHAM
THE ONE CONTEMPORARY REFERENCE TO ISRAEL THUS FAR FOUND IN THE EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS COMES FROM THE REIGN OF MERNEPTAH THE SON OF RAMSES II
MOST PAINFUL OF ALL WAS THE EVER-HAUNTING SENSE OF FEAR BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS WRONG ACTS THAT FOLLOWED HIM EVEN IN HIS LIFE AS AN EXILE AND LIKE A SPECTRE CONFRONTED HIM AS HE RETURNED AGAIN TO THE SCENES OF HIS BOYHOOD
THE TENTH COMMAND WHICH PLACES THE EMPHASIS ON THE MOTIVE RATHER THAN THE ACT ALSO SUGGESTS A MATURER AGE

THE PRIDE OF OFFICE THE TRADITIONS OF THE BENCH HAVE SUSTAINED HIM
THUS THE LESSONS SO DEEPLY IMPRESSED IN THE CHILDHOOD OF THE RACE HAVE A LARGE AND GROWING SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE
IN THE LIGHT OF OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CANAANITE CIVILIZATION IT BECOMES EVIDENT WHY MOST OF THE EARLY HEBREW CONQUESTS WERE IN THE SOUTH
EVEN THE THEORIES REGARDING THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM ARE STILL CONFLICTING AND NONE IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED
CLEMENS MARK TWAIN ADVISED A YOUNG MAN WHO DESIRED TO ENTER BUSINESS TO SELECT THE FIRM WITH WHICH HE WISHED TO BE ASSOCIATED THEN ASK THAT THEY GIVE HIM WORK WITHOUT MENTIONING THE SUBJECT OF COMPENSATION

STUDY III THE CRIMINAL AND HIS RELATION TO SOCIETY
IN THE DEEPER SENSE EACH OF THESE EARLY HEBREW STORIES IS HISTORICAL FOR THEY ALL RECORD THE FUNDAMENTAL THOUGHT AND BELIEF THAT THROUGH THIS STRENUOUS PAINFUL PERIOD EVEN AS IN LATER CRISES IN THEIR HISTORY JEHOVAH WAS GUIDING HIS PEOPLE AND GIVING THEM NOT ONLY FOOD AND WATER BUT ALSO THAT TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF DANGER AND PRIVATION WHICH WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT

MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH FURTHERMORE IT IS SUGGESTED THAT GRATITUDE TO THE NEW GOD WHO DELIVERED THE ISRAELITES FROM THEIR BONDAGE WAS THE REASON WHY THEY PROVED ON THE WHOLE SO LOYAL TO JEHOVAH
AMIDST THE WARRING ELEMENTS IN PALESTINE A POWERFUL NATION WAS GRADUALLY TAKING FORM

ONE OF THE AIMS OF THESE NARRATIVES IT SEEMS TO MANY SCHOLARS IS TO EXPLAIN WHY THE ISRAELITES THE YOUNGER PEOPLE WHO SETTLED LATEST IN PALESTINE ULTIMATELY POSSESSED THE LAND AND CONQUERED THE EDOMITES
THE HAGAR OF THE STORY IS A TYPICAL DAUGHTER OF THE DESERT

THUS ISRAEL'S EARLY HISTORY ILLUSTRATES THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH THAT THE MOST ESSENTIAL THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE IN THE MAKING OF A NATION IS A SIMPLE PRACTICAL EVERY-DAY RELIGION
THERE IS THE INSTINCT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO PRESERVE HIS OWN LIFE AND THERE ARE RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED IF THE PEOPLE ARE TO SURVIVE
FOR THEE I HAVE FOUND RIGHTEOUS BEFORE ME IN THIS GENERATION
1 THE EGYPTIAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
THE SABBATH WAS MADE FOR MAN NOT MAN FOR THE SABBATH DOES THE SOCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF THE SABBATH OBSCURE OR DEEPEN ITS RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE
MAY THE HEBREWS HAVE ORIGINALLY INTERPRETED THE COMMAND OF EXODUS 20 AS A DEMAND THAT JEHOVAH BE GIVEN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE WORSHIP AND FAITH OF ISRAEL

WAYS BY WHICH THE HEBREWS WON THEIR HOMES
OF THESE TWO BROTHERS WHICH ON THE WHOLE IS THE MORE ATTRACTIVE
8:13 THE OLDER COMMAND IN EXODUS 34 THOU SHALL MAKE THEE NO MOLTEN GODS WAS PROBABLY INTENDED TO GUARD THE ISRAELITES FROM IMITATING THE RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS OF THEIR HEATHEN NEIGHBORS SUCH AS THE EGYPTIANS AND THE MOABITES
THE RESULT OF HIS WISE AND JUST MEASURES WAS TO BRING INTO HIS COUNTRY SO LARGE A NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS WHO PREFERRED TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE JUSTICE REIGNED THAT THE PROSPERITY AROUSED THE ENVY AND HOSTILITY OF THE NEIGHBORING STATES

HE WAS ALSO A PROPHET-STATESMAN ABLE TO GRASP AND INTERPRET THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GREAT CRISES IN THE LIFE OF HIS PEOPLE AND TO SUGGEST PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS
COURAGE AND REAL PATRIOTISM WERE ALMOST UNKNOWN TO THEM EVEN AS EARLY AS THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY B.C WHEN THE EGYPTIAN KING THUTMOSE III INVADED THE LAND OF PALESTINE
BUT THEY TAUGHT ALSO THAT WISDOM WHICH IS NOT ONLY KNOWLEDGE BUT THE POWER TO APPLY IT PRACTICALLY IN THE VARIOUS RELATIONS OF LIFE WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
EACH WAS KEENLY CONSCIOUS THAT THE LAWS WHICH BROUGHT SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH TO MANKIND EMANATED FROM THE DIVINE POWER THAT WAS GUIDING THE DESTINIES OF MEN
IN THE LIGHT OF LATER HISTORY WHAT WAS THE PROFOUND RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE TO HIS RACE AND TO THE WORLD OF THE MIGRATION REPRESENTED BY ABRAHAM

THE REASONS WHY THEY FAILED TO ENTER CANAAN FROM THE SOUTH ARE SUGGESTED IN THE NARRATIVE OF THE SPIES AND CONFIRMED BY A STUDY OF THE HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION

THAT THE OLDER DECALOGUE WAS WRITTEN ON TWO TABLETS AND SET UP IN THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON IS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE FOR BY THE DAYS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM THE HEBREWS WERE BEGINNING TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE ART OF WRITING AND THEREFORE COULD READ THE LAWS IN WRITTEN FORM
THE HEBREWS ON ESCAPING FROM EGYPT ENTERED THE SOUTH COUNTRY WHICH EXTENDS SEVENTY MILES FROM THE ROCKY HILLS OF JUDAH SOUTHWARD UNTIL IT MERGES INTO THE BARREN DESERT
IN THE DAYS OF THE HEBREW SETTLEMENT THE CANAANITES WERE LARGELY CONFINED TO THE FERTILE VALLEYS

THE SAME IS TRUE IN OUR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE
UNFORTUNATELY THE REAL MEANING AND MESSAGE OF THE BIBLE HAS BEEN IN PART OBSCURED DURING PAST CENTURIES BY DOGMATIC INTERPRETATIONS
BACK OF THE STORY OF ABRAHAM'S CALL AND SETTLEMENT IN CANAAN CLEARLY LIES THE HISTORIC FACT THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE HEBREWS AS NOMADS MIGRATED FROM THE LAND OF ARAM TO SEEK FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR DESCENDANTS A PERMANENT HOME IN THE LAND OF CANAAN

THE CANAANITE CITIES OF SOUTHERN PALESTINE WERE BUILT LARGELY WITH THE VIEW TO PROTECTING THEIR INHABITANTS FROM THE EVER-LURKING NOMAD INVADERS
THIS ACT INSTEAD OF BEING CONDEMNED WAS REGARDED THEN AND EVEN BY LATER GENERATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE OF COURAGEOUS PATRIOTISM
NOTE THE METHOD OF CREATION AND THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF EACH DAY
WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH AN ACT IN THE UNITED STATES
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ARK IN GENESIS 6:14-16 IS NOT ONLY CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT FOUND IN THE BABYLONIAN ACCOUNT BUT THE METHOD--THE SMEARING OF THE ARK WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH BITUMEN--IS PECULIAR TO THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES VALLEY

THIS APPEALED TO ALL THE INSTINCTS BEGOTTEN BY HIS SHEPHERD TRAINING
AT FIRST THE INHABITANTS OF JERICHO ACCUSTOMED TO ARAB STRATEGY UNDOUBTEDLY HELD THEMSELVES READY FOR DEFENCE
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF GREEK HISTORY THE LAWS OF SOLON AND DRACO WERE FORMULATED
IN THE LIGHT OF THESE PROFOUND RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS MAY ANY ONE REASONABLY QUESTION THE RIGHT OF THESE STORIES TO A PLACE IN THE BIBLE
THEN JACOB GAVE ESAU BREAD AND STEWED LENTILS AND WHEN HE HAD EATEN AND DRANK HE ROSE UP AND WENT HIS WAY
THE STYLE IS THAT OF A LEGAL WRITER--FORMAL EXACT AND REPETITIOUS
IT WAS THIS SAME DEMOCRATIC ATMOSPHERE THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE WORK OF THOSE PROPHETS WHO OPENLY DENOUNCED THE CRIMES OF KING AND PEOPLE
THE NATURE OF SIN
THE NATURE OF SIN
EVEN IN THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM THE BABYLONIANS GODS THE HOST OF HEAVEN WERE WORSHIPPED BY CERTAIN OF THE HEBREWS
AT BEST THE HISTORICAL DATA WHICH IT PRESERVES ARE EXCEEDINGLY SMALL AND OF DOUBTFUL VALUE
THE NAME EDOM IS FOUND IN AN INSCRIPTION OF A KING OF THE EIGHTH EGYPTIAN DYNASTY IN THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE ESAU EVIDENTLY IS THE TRADITIONAL ANCESTOR OF THE EDOMITES EVEN AS JACOB FIGURES AS THE FATHER OF THE TWELVE TRIBES
GOD SAW THAT IT WAS GOOD WHAT WAS THE CULMINATING ACT OF CREATION
IS THERE GEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE EARTH DURING HUMAN HISTORY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY INUNDATED
NORTHWARD EASTWARD AND SOUTHWARD EXTENDED FOR MILES THE LEVEL PLAIN OF THE JORDAN RIVER WHICH PLOWED ITS WAY THROUGH ITS ALLUVIAL BED SIX MILES EAST OF JERICHO
THIS SPOT WAS PROBABLY THE SCENE OF THE HISTORIC CROSSING AT THE BEGINNING OF HEBREW HISTORY
RECENT EXCAVATIONS HAVE ALSO SHOWN WHY LATER GENERATIONS REGARDED ITS CAPTURE BY THE HEBREWS AS A MIRACLE ALTHOUGH MANY MODERN INTERPRETERS HOLD THAT THE EARLY ACCOUNT DOES NOT IMPLY THAT IT WAS BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS
THEN THE LUST WHEN IT HATH CONCEIVED BEARETH SIN
EACH CITY HAD ITS LOCAL GOD OR BAAL WHICH WAS WORSHIPPED AT A HIGH PLACE EITHER WITHIN THE CITY OR ON SOME ADJACENT HEIGHT WHILE IN THE LARGER CITIES ELABORATE ALTARS AND TEMPLES WERE REARED TO THEM
IT WAS A SOMETHING WELL KNOWN AMONGST THEM BUT KNOWN WITHOUT WORDS AND AS BY A SUBTLE INSTINCT FOR NO MAN WHO HAD EXPERIENCED IT EVER SPOKE WILLINGLY ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS
HOW DO A MAN'S HABITS AFFECT HIS EFFICIENCY

ONLY THE INFLUENCE OF THE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS AMONG HIS PEOPLE AND THEIR BELIEF IN JEHOVAH TOGETHER WITH THE RELIGIOUS AWE FELT BY THE EGYPTIAN RULERS ENABLED HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT HE COULD RESCUE HIS PEOPLE
THE FINAL STAGE IN THE EVOLUTION OF ISRAEL IS RECORDED IN THE OPENING CHAPTERS OF I SAMUEL AND IS BEST STUDIED IN DETAIL IN CONNECTION WITH THE HISTORY OF THE NATION AT ITS ZENITH

OTHER WRITERS DECLARE IT PROBABLE THAT A TRIBAL SHEIK BY THE NAME OF ABRAHAM LED ONE OF THE MANY NOMAD TRIBES THAT SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND MILLENIUM B.C
THE EARLY HEBREW NARRATIVES IMPLY THAT CERTAIN NOMADIC TRIBES AS FOR EXAMPLE THE CALEBITES THE KENIZZITES AND THE JERAHMEELITES INDEPENDENTLY GAINED A FOOTHOLD ON THE SOUTHERN BORDERS OF CANAAN AND ULTIMATELY ASSIMILATED WITH THE HEBREW TRIBE OF JUDAH WHEN THE LATTER ENTERED PALESTINE
EQUALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES MAY LIE BEFORE EVERY PASTOR AND TEACHER AND CITIZEN
THE METHOD OF ATTACK RECORDED IN THE PROPHETIC NARRATIVE WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRATEGY USED A LITTLE LATER BY THE HEBREWS IN THE CAPTURE OF THE SMALLER TOWNS OF AI AND BETHEL
TRIBES MIGRATE FROM SEASON TO SEASON AS DID THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND EVENTUALLY SOME MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE ARE LIKELY TO GO FORTH TO SEEK NEW HOMES
THEIR SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCES ALSO TENDED TO REVIVE THIS MEMORY

THE NOBLEST IDEALS IN EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION ARE OFTEN THUS CONCRETELY EMBODIED IN THE CHARACTER OF SOME NATIONAL HERO
PICK OUT THE LEADING STATESMEN OF THE LAST HALF CENTURY IN ENGLAND GERMANY AND ITALY
A STATESMAN CONSIDERS NOT MERELY HIS OWN VIEWS REGARDING THE BEST METHODS OF GOVERNING HIS COUNTRY OR OF GAINING SPECIAL ENDS BUT HE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALSO WHAT PLANS CAN IN PRACTICE BE CARRIED OUT
PRACTICALLY ALL MODERN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RELATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE SECURITY OF CONTRACTS AND UPON THE READINESS OF BUSINESS MEN AND CITIZENS TO KEEP THEIR WORD
WHAT SHOULD BE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SINNER
HENCE IT WAS NOT UNNATURAL TO ASCRIBE THE ORIGIN OF THESE LAWS TO MOSES NOR IS IT TO-DAY INACCURATE TO SPEAK OF THEM AS THE MOSAIC CODE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THEIR PRESENT FORM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS REMOTE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND BY RULERS PROPHETS AND PRIESTS WHOSE OCCUPATIONS AND ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE WERE WIDELY DIFFERENT
AND JEHOVAH LOOKED FAVORABLY UPON ABEL AND HIS OFFERING
DID THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD DONE WRONG OR MERELY THAT THEY HAD INCURRED A PENALTY

WHY ARE THEY OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS DESCENDANTS OF THE GODS

THE TENDENCY TO IDEALIZE NATIONAL HEROES IS BY NO MEANS CONFINED TO THE HEBREWS
WAS THE MAN'S ACT IN ANY WAY EXCUSABLE
IN MANY CASES THEY WERE HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER
HEBREW TRADITION HAS DESCRIBED IN A GREAT VARIETY OF NARRATIVES THE WAY IN WHICH GOD MADE KNOWN HIS WILL TO THE PEOPLE
WHAT ARE HIS CHIEF INTERESTS IN THE LATTER PART OF HIS LIFE
THEN CAIN SAID TO ABEL HIS BROTHER LET US GO INTO THE FIELD
DID THESE DIFFERENT METHODS UNDER THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES RESULT IN THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

HAMMURABI LOOKED UPON HIMSELF AS A SHEPHERD CHOSEN BY THE GODS TO CARE FOR HIS PEOPLE

JEHOVAH SAID TO ABRAHAM GO FORTH FROM THY COUNTRY AND FROM THY KINDRED AND FROM THY FATHER'S HOUSE TO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW THEE THAT I MAY MAKE OF THEE A GREAT NATION

HE ADVISED THAT INSTEAD OF RENDERING DECISIONS REGARDING EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE MOSES SHOULD FORMULATE THE PRINCIPLES AND LEAVE THEIR APPLICATION TO MINOR JUDGES APPOINTED BY HIMSELF AS RULERS OVER THOUSANDS AND OVER HUNDREDS AND FIFTIES AND TENS
HOW MANY REALIZE THAT MOST OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH ISRAEL MET AND SOLVED ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH TO-DAY ARE COMMANDING THE ABSORBING ATTENTION OF EVERY PATRIOTIC CITIZEN AND THAT OF ALL EXISTING BOOKS THE OLD TESTAMENT MAKES THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AS WELL AS TO THE RELIGIOUS THOUGHT OF THE WORLD
ORDINARILY THE FORTY YEARS REPRESENT A GENERATION

ACCORDING TO MANY MODERN INTERPRETERS THE EARLIEST HEBREW HOST MARCHED SILENTLY ABOUT THE CANAANITE STRONGHOLD
