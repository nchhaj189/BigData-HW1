NEXT WERE THE BOWER WHERE THE WOMEN WORKED AND THE GUEST HOUSE WHERE VISITORS SLEPT
=X ANY CHARACTER WITH UPPER MACRON X
BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON THEY SAW A WHITE CLOUD RESTING ON THE WATER FAR OFF
HEAR MY SONG OF KING HALFDAN FOR THIS MAN WAS A SKALD
THE FARMERS WERE HAPPY
FOR HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO TO VALHALLA
DONE INTO ENGLISH BY WILLIAM MORRIS AND EIRIKR MAGNUSSON
GYDA WAS STANDING NEAR WEAVING A RICH CLOAK
WE SET OUT WITH A FAIR SHIP AND WITH GLAD HEARTS BUT WE TOSSED ABOUT ALL SUMMER ON THE SEA AND GOT NOWHERE
BERNARD QUARITCH LONDON
BERNARD QUARITCH LONDON
SOMETIMES THE NORSEMEN LOST BUT OFTENER THEY WON SO THAT THEY GOT LAND AND LIVED IN THOSE COUNTRIES
THEN THEY CAME BACK THE NEXT SUMMER AND DID THE SAME DEEDS OVER AGAIN
IN THREE VOLUMES
HE HAD SHOES OF SCARLET WITH GOLDEN CLASPS
HARALD I WILL GIVE YOU A NEW NAME
WE WILL FILL THE ROWBOAT WITH GRAPES AND TOW IT BEHIND US
HORNS BLOW THERE WAS A BLOWING OF HORNS ON BOTH SIDES
KING HARALD HEARD OF THIS AND HE LAUGHED AND SAID
THE ROOM WAS FULL OF SHOUTING AND RUNNING AND SWORD-CLASHING
THEY WENT WHEN THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLD AND STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE GROWN
OUTLAWED FROM ALL OF THEM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS QUARRELS
TEN SONS SAT AT MEAT WITH HIM AND I WAS THE YOUNGEST
WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE SPRING THE KING GAVE HIM TWO THRALLS AS A PARTING GIFT
THEY PUT GOLD-TRIMMED SADDLES AND BRIDLES UPON THREE HORSES
THE PEOPLE IN THEM WERE ALL MAKING A HORRIBLE SHOUT
IT IS STRANGE THAT SO GOOD A LAND SHOULD BE EMPTY
THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
WHEN I AM EIGHT YEARS OLD I WILL HAVE A SWORD A SHARP TOOTH OF WAR HE SWUNG HIS DAGGER AS THOUGH IT WERE A LONG SWORD
OUT WITH IT HE CRIED
LET THE GODS DECIDE I SAID AND TOSSED UP MY SPEAR
MANY SWORDS HAD BIT INTO HIS FLESH AND LEFT MARKS THERE BUT NEVER A ONE HAD STRUCK HIM TO DEATH
THEY STAYED MANY DAYS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WALKED ABOUT TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE
WE HAVE MADE YOUR FAMILY LARGER BROTHER INGOLF
I NEED MY SWORD FOR YOUR SAKE FOSTER-BROTHER
GAIMARD
SOME OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS I HAVE INTRODUCED INTO THE BOOK IN THE FORM OF NOTES HOPING THAT THE CHILDREN IN TURNING TO THEM MIGHT FORM A HABIT OF INSISTING UPON FULL UNDERSTANDING OF A POINT AND MIGHT POSSIBLY WITH THE TEACHER'S ENCOURAGEMENT BEGIN THE HABIT OF REFERENCE READING
HE SENDS THEM OUT AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEE OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
WINTER IS COMING ON AND WE MUST NOT BE CAUGHT WITH NOTHING TO EAT SO HE STAYED AND WORKED AND SENT TWO OF HIS THRALLS TO LOOK FOR THE HOLY POSTS
THERE HELA WHO IS QUEEN ALWAYS SNEERS AT THEM AND A TERRIBLE COLD TAKES HOLD OF THEIR BONES AND THEY SIT DOWN AND FREEZE
HE SPREAD IT OUT AND SHOWED IT TO THE OTHERS
THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS ICELAND BARING-GOULD
THERE WERE BENCHES FOR TWENTY MEN ALONG EACH SIDE
SO THEY BURNED THE BONES AND THE FAT OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILLED
HIS FEET AND LEGS WERE COVERED WITH GRAY WOOLEN TIGHTS
KING HAVARD STAMPS THE SHORE
I AM GOING TO WALK UP THAT VALLEY YONDER ONE OF THE MEN SAID
SEE SAID INGOLF POINTING TO IT SEE WHAT IS LEFT OF A GOOD SHIP'S PROW
FAR ALONG THE COAST HE SAW SOME LITTLE ISLANDS
BUT AT LAST THE PEOPLE SAW AGAIN THE WHITE CLOUD AND SAW IT GROWING INTO LAND AND MOUNTAINS
SOON IT BLAZED UP AND WE COULD SEE ABOUT US
MY STOMACH IS SICK OF SEAL AND WHALE AND BEAR
I HAVE BEEN DRIVEN ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE LIKE A SEABIRD IN A STORM
KING HARALD RODE AT THE FRONT OF HIS ARMY WITH HIS STANDARD-BEARER BESIDE HIM
FOR SURELY ODIN HAS CHOSEN YOU FOR VALHALLA EVEN THOUGH YOU DID NOT SACRIFICE
BUT FLOKI HIMSELF SAID THAT THE SEA ABOUT THE ISLAND IS FULL OF ICE THAT PUSHES UPON THE LAND THAT NO SHIP CAN LIVE IN THAT WATER IN THE WINTER THAT GREAT MOUNTAINS OF ICE COVER THE ISLAND
PUTNAM'S SONS NEW YORK ARE MANY COPIES OF NORSE ANTIQUITIES IN THE FASHION OF WEAPONS SHIELD-BOSSES COINS JEWELRY WOOD-CARVING
THROW DIRT ON THE FIRE
SO HE WENT AND BATHED AND PUT ON FRESH CLOTHES
A CHAIN OF ISLANDS LOOSELY CONNECTS NORWAY WITH AMERICA,--ORKNEYS AND SHETLANDS FAROES ICELAND GREENLAND
WILL THEY NOT EVEN LET ME FINISH ONE FEAST THEN HE LAUGHED
I DID NOT THINK WHEN WE MADE THOSE VOWS OF FOSTER-BROTHERHOOD THAT THIS WOULD EVER HAPPEN
THE BATTLE HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR AN HOUR
IT MADE THEM LOOK LIKE GREEN MOUNDS WITH GAY CARVED AND PAINTED WALLS UNDER THEM
WE WENT IN
GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU
CHAPMAN HALL LONDON 1868 SAGA TIME VICARY
THE CHIEF TOOK SOME AND HELD THEM OUT TO THORFINN AND HUGGED THE CLOAK TO HIM
I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY HEART TO DO HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND HIS FACE GLOWED
IT IS CARRYING OUR SHIP AWAY FROM THIS LAND
THEY POINTED OUT WHERE IT HAD GONE
THERE SAT KING HARALD IN THE HIGH SEAT
GRAPES THEY WERE SHOUTING
THE LAND THERE WAS LOW AND GREEN
WELL FRIEND FARMER LAUGHED ONE WHY SUCH A LONG FACE
BUT THINGS ARE GOING BADLY IN THE PROW HE CRIED
HE HAD BUT ONE OX
HE SHALL BE CALLED HARALD
THEY SAILED ON SOUTH ALL THE TIME LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO GO ASHORE
FOR THERE WERE FEW ROADS OR BRIDGES IN NORWAY
WHAT ARE YOUR NAME AND COUNTRY I AM LEIF ERICSSON AND I HAVE COME ALL THE WAY FROM GREENLAND TO SEE YOU AND OLD NORWAY FROM GREENLAND SAID THE KING
INGOLF FOLLOWED THEM WITH HIS SHIP
MY HEART MOVES ME TO TRY THIS FROLIC HE SPOKE TO GUDRID ABOUT IT
THE OTHER WAY OF KNOWING ONE HAKI FROM THE OTHER WAS TO TELL HIS FATHER'S NAME
BUT THESE SPOTS ARE ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR GRAVES THE MEN SAID
HE RAN IN THE WOODS AND CLIMBED THE HILLS AND WADED IN THE CREEK
SO OF THOSE THIRTY-FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
THORKEL MEANS THOR'S FIRE
LUMBER THEY CRIED
AND EVERYONE SAW SOME PLACE WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO GO
HIS BOATS ARE READY IN LINE OF BATTLE
THEIR FLASHING EYES LOOKED OVER THEIR SHIELDS
EARLY NEXT MORNING WE SHOOK HANDS WITH OUR HOST AND BOARDED THE WAVERUNNER AND SAILED OFF
HOW DOES GREENLAND SOUND HIS MEN LAUGHED AND SAID
A WHOLE FAMILY SAT FOR HOURS AROUND THE FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
THEN ONE DAY LEIF AS HE SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND SANG
I HAVE DECIDED TO ACCEPT MORE OF IT MY MEN ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
NEXT IT IS A MOUNTAIN OF ICE WHERE MEN WOULD FREEZE TO DEATH
MY FATHER WAS GUDBRAND THE BIG
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
WHEN THE MEN IN THE SMITHY SAW THE RUNES THEY OPENED THEIR EYES WIDE AND LOOKED AT THE BOY FOR FEW NORSEMEN COULD READ
NO ONE HERE COULD MAKE A SONG IF HE TRIED
SO HE WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE KING HAD HIS FINE HOUSE
ONE DAY I STOOD ON A MOUNTAIN AND LOOKED INLAND
SOME OF THE NORSEMEN WERE HIT ON THE HEAD AND KNOCKED DOWN
I WILL SERVE YOU IN WAR
ONCE THEY RAN INTO A FOG
IF THEY WANT RED STUFF I HAVE A WHOLE ROLL OF RED CLOTH THAT I WILL TRADE ONE OF THE OTHER MEN SAID
FOR INSTANCE A CARVED SHIP'S-HEAD OR A COPPER SHIELD OR A WROUGHT DOOR-NAIL
IT LOOKS FAR OVER THE COUNTRY
IT WAS STREAKED WITH FADED PAINT AND IT SHOWED BITS OF CARVING
I GIVE BELOW AN OUTLINE OF A YEAR'S WORK ON THE SUBJECT THAT WAS ONCE FOLLOWED BY THE FOURTH GRADE OF THE CHICAGO NORMAL SCHOOL
IT IS BETTER UNDER KING HARALD BUT THE CHIEFS WHO LIKED TO FIGHT AND GO A-VIKING HATED KING HARALD AND HIS NEW WAYS
THEN HARALD SAID
THIS GYDA IS A BOLD AND SAUCY GIRL KING HARALD
AEGIR THE BIG-HANDED THEY CALLED HIM
NOW THIS GYDA IS MY WIFE THEN THEY DRANK THE STIRRUP-HORN AND RODE OFF
WE MUST STAY TOGETHER FARTHER NORTH THEY FOUND ONLY THE SAME BARE FROZEN COUNTRY
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS POSSIBLY THIS BOOK SEEMS MADE UP OF FOUR OR FIVE DISCONNECTED STORIES
RUNES WERE CUT ON THE HANDLE OF THE SPEAR TELLING THE DUTIES OF FOSTER-BROTHERS
I HEARD A CUCKOO TO-DAY IT IS THE CALL TO GO A-VIKING I SAID
THE DOORS ARE GIVING WAY SO WE TEN MEN STOOD AT THE DOORS AND HELD BACK THE KING'S SOLDIERS
KEEP CLOSE TOGETHER SO THAT DOUBLE LINE OF MEN WITH SWORDS SWINGING FROM BOTH SIDES RAN OUT THROUGH THE DARK
MANY OF THESE OLD VELLUM BOOKS HAVE BEEN SAVED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND ARE NOW IN MUSEUMS IN NORWAY
WHAT DOES IT SAY THEY ASKED
IT WAS LEIF
HE IS TOO GOOD A MAN FOR THAT ON THE NEXT DAY THE STORM WAS NOT SO HARD AND INGOLF PUT IN AT A GOOD HARBOR
LOOK CRIED ANOTHER POINTING
I WILL SETTLE WHERE HE LEADS ME SO THAT SUMMER THEY LOADED EVERYTHING INTO THE SHIPS AGAIN AND SAILED WEST ALONG THE COAST UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PILLARS WERE
HE WENT AND GOT IT
A BROAD BAY WITH ISLANDS IN THE MOUTH WAS AT THE SIDE
IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL
NEAR THEM THE NORSEMEN LIGHTED FIRES AND COOKED THEIR SUPPER
YEARS AFTERWARD THE GREENLANDERS HEARD THAT THEY WERE SHIPWRECKED AND MADE SLAVES IN IRELAND
AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE THE THRALLS CAME RUNNING INTO THE HOUSE AND TOOK DOWN ALL THE SWORDS AND SHIELDS FROM THE WALL AND RAN OUT
SOON WE CANNOT SAIL ANY LONGER
BUT IT WAS PLEASANT WOOD SMOKE AND THE NORSEMEN DID NOT DISLIKE IT
SURELY HARALD NEVER KNELT BEFORE
THESE CLOAK-PINS CAME FROM A FAR COUNTRY CALLED GREECE
WHERE ARE YOU NOW
HER FATHER TOO DIED NOT LONG AGO
WHAT WILL MAKE THEM BRAVE AND WISE
HE STOPPED AT ALL OF THESE PLACES AND FEASTED HIS MIND ON THE NEW THINGS
IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF FLOATING ICE SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE FROM ICELAND
IN MANY A BATTLE HIS SWORD HAD SUNG AND HE HAD SENT MANY WARRIORS TO VALHALLA
WHO CALLS I CALL I ANSWERED
ONLY THREE DRAGONS BEFORE OURS HAVE EVER SWEPT THIS WATER AND MEN ARE NOT SAILING THIS WAY FOR PLEASURE OR RICHES SO ONLY THE DESOLATE SEA STRETCHED AROUND THEM
THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON
ALL THIS TIME THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SHOUTING AND HAMMERING AT THE DOORS BUT THEY WERE OF HEAVY LOGS AND STOOD
FOLLOW ME CRIED HARALD
THERE WAS BUT ONE DOOR TO THE HOUSE
ALL TOGETHER THEY GOT INTO THE BOAT AND WENT TO EYJOLF'S FARM
THE WIND SHOT PAST HIM HOWLING
THEY PUT BIG PIECES OF THIS MEAT INTO PLATTERS OF WOOD AND SET IT BEFORE THE MEN
WHEN A MAN GOT NEW LAND HE HAD TO CLEAR OFF THE TREES IN THOSE OLDEN DAYS A MAN DID NOT HAVE A SURNAME THAT BELONGED TO EVERYONE IN HIS FAMILY
WHEN SPRINGTIME CAME LEIF THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD SOW WHEAT
YOU LOOK LIKE BRAVE MEN
SO THEY FOUGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND WON AND DROVE THEM FARTHER NORTH AND FARTHER NORTH
AFTER A WHILE ERIC SAID
THEY KEPT THE CATTLE AND THE HAY IN IT
WHO KNOWS WHAT TERRIBLE THING MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM IN THESE GREAT FORESTS THEN HE TURNED AND STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR HIM
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED KING HARALD TOOK A BRACELET FROM HIS ARM AND GAVE IT TO HIM SAYING
ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN
WHEN THE SKALD WAS TIRED SOME OTHER MAN WOULD COME UP FROM THE CROWD AND SING OR TELL A STORY
WHEN SHALL I STAND IN THE PROW OF A DRAGON AND FEAST ON THE FIGHT
WHY DID WE NOT THINK OF THAT THEN HE RAISED HIS HORN HIGH
THEY LOOKED HER OVER CAREFULLY AND RECALKED EVERY SEAM AND FRESHLY PAINTED HER AND PUT INTO HER THEIR STRONGEST OARS AND MADE HER A NEW SAIL
AND THAT SHOUT WENT ALL AROUND AND WE DREW OUT OUR SWORDS AND CAUGHT UP OUR SHIELDS
AFTER THEM THEY WERE SHOUTING
THEY WENT TO THE MEAD TUBS
HE TOOK INGOLF ABOARD HIS SHIP AND RAISED THE COVERS OF GREAT CHESTS
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE THEY WERE AFRAID TO MAKE WAR UPON HIM FOR HE WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR
HE AND HIS MEN WALKED ALL AROUND IT AND FELT OF THE TIMBER AND WENT INTO IT AND LOOKED AT ALL THE THINGS THERE--SPADES AND CLOAKS AND DRINKING-HORNS
MEN FOUND IT AND WENT THERE TO LIVE MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS AGO
IT IS ALL PLAY NEAR THE END OF SUMMER THORFINN SPOKE TO HIS COMRADES
SLOVEN CRIED HAKON AND HE STRUCK THORKEL WITH HIS FIST AND KNOCKED HIM OVER INTO THE CUPBOARD
THEY ARE NOT MY WORDS O KING
NOW THEY HUNG SOME OF THE MEAT OF THE HORSES ON A TREE NEAR THE TEMPLE
9 SEE NOTE ABOUT RAN ON PAGE 198
THIS TIME IT WAS BLACK WITH THEM THERE WERE SO MANY
THE THIRD TIME THEY STOPPED BEFORE THE CROSS-BENCH
I WILL SAIL TO NORWAY AND I WILL HARRY THE COAST AND FILL MY BOAT WITH RICHES
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THESE THINGS HAPPENED BEFORE ERIC FOUND GREENLAND
SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AND WEPT
AND EVERYWHERE MEN RECEIVED HIM GLADLY
THE FARMER MET US AT THE DOOR BUT HE DIED BY THORKEL'S SWORD
THEN I SAID
HIS HEAD HUNG ON HIS BREAST
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE SMITHY AND SMOOTHED HIS POLE AND DROVE IT INTO THE HAFT OF THE SPEAR-POINT
I HAD A STRANGE DREAM LAST NIGHT
THE TABLES HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT AND THE MEAD-HORNS WERE GOING ROUND
HERE THE FIRES BURNED
THE REST OF YOU OFF A-VIKING HE HAD THREE SHIPS
I DRINK TO VALHALLA TO-NIGHT CRIED THORKEL THE THIRSTY AND HE PLUNGED HIS HORN DEEP INTO THE TUB
THE WOMEN SAT AND LOOKED ON
I ASK YOU BOTH AND ALL YOUR MEN TO SPEND THE WINTER AT MY HOUSE
THEN THORFINN SAW TO THE UNLOADING AND STORING OF HIS GOODS
HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY
IT WAS AN UNJUST DECISION SOME ONE CRIED
PRINTING
YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE A MAN MY MEN POUNDED THE TABLE WITH THEIR FISTS
AT LAST ALL THINGS WERE READY FOR STARTING
ON THE SEA I MET THIS OTHER SHIP FROM ICELAND
THEN HE WEIGHED THE SPEAR IN HIS HAND AND FOUND THE BALANCING POINT AND PUT ANOTHER GOLD BAND THERE TO MARK IT
IT IS A GOOD GRAVE FOR NORSEMEN AND VIKINGS
GUDRID IS A BEAUTIFUL AND WISE WOMAN
BUT BOYS GREW FAST IN THOSE DAYS FOR THEY WERE OUT OF DOORS ALL THE TIME RUNNING SWIMMING LEAPING ON SKEES AND HUNTING IN THE FOREST
WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND GRAPES THORFINN AND BIARNI AND ALL THEIR MEN SAILED SOUTH AGAIN
IT WAS NO BATTLE ANOTHER REPLIED
WELL THIEVES MUST DIE
BEFORE THEM WALKED THRALLS CARRYING CANDLES
THE FIRES SHONE ON SO MANY GOLDEN HEAD-BANDS AND BRACELETS AND SO MANY GLITTERING SWORDS AND SPEARS ON THE WALL AND THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHING THAT AT FIRST LEIF DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
HERE IS A GOOD FIELD FOR SPORT
I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT CRIED THE MEN
BUT INSTEAD HE IS IN RAN'S CAVES AND ONLY HIS BROKEN PROW HAS DRIFTED HERE NOW IT WAS NOT MANY MONTHS AFTER THAT WHEN ONE OF THE MEN CAME RUNNING INTO THE FEAST HALL SHOUTING
HE HAD TEN THRALLS THAT HE HAD GOT IN IRELAND
I SAY THAT I WILL NOT CUT MY HAIR OR COMB IT UNTIL I AM KING OF ALL NORWAY
SOON A GREAT ARMY WAS GATHERED
THE SIDES WERE STEEP AND SMOOTH
THEY WERE ABOUT TO SERVE IT TO GYDA FOR THE BRIDE'S FEAST BUT HARALD TOOK THE DISH FROM THEM AND SAID
THOR BROKE THEM OLAF SAID
IT WAS OF BRASS
CAN I NOT TELL GRAPES WHEN I SEE THEM CRIED TYRKER
DID I NOT GROW UP IN GERMANY WHERE EVERY HILLSIDE IS COVERED WITH GRAPEVINES
HE CRIED OUT
HERE IS A RING FOR SIF THE FRIENDLY AND HERE IS A BRACELET A SWORD WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO HANG AT YOUR SIDE I TOOK FIVE GREAT BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
THE SKY IS A GOOD ENOUGH TENT FOR A SOLDIER SAID THE NORSEMEN
WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN
NEAR HIS FEAST HALL HE BUILT A STOREHOUSE AND A KITCHEN AND A SMITHY AND A STABLE AND A BOWER FOR THE WOMEN
YESTERDAY HE HAD A HARD FIGHT THEY SAID
A GOOD SPEAR HE SAID
IT IS BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH AND YELLOW AND ALL PEOPLE WONDERED AT THE BEAUTY OF THE KING'S HAIR
BUT BEFORE GUDRID HE SPREAD BEAUTIFUL CLOTH AND GOLD EMBROIDERY AND GOLDEN NECKLACES
I WILL TAKE THE PILLARS OF MY HIGH SEAT TO ICELAND HE SAID AND I WILL SET UP MY ALTAR THERE UPON THE SOIL OF NORWAY THE SOIL THAT ALL MY ANCESTORS HAVE TROD THE SOIL THAT THOR LOVES SO THEY CARRIED THE PILLARS AND THE CHEST OF EARTH AND THE STATUES OF THE GODS AND PUT THEM INTO INGOLF'S BOAT
IT LOOKS LIKE SMOKE THE MEN SAID
SHE CAN CURE ANY SICKNESS
IN THE HOUSE OF ODIN THE ALL-FATHER THERE IS A GREAT FEAST HALL LARGER THAN THE WHOLE EARTH
SHE IS THE WIDOW OF MY SON THORSTEIN ERIC SAID
HARALD DIVIDED IT INTO PILES
THERE WERE NO LARGE WINDOWS IN A FEAST HALL OR IN ANY OTHER NORSE BUILDING
THE PEOPLE AT ERIC'S HOUSE WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE THEM
MAY BOATS SANK MANY MEN DIED SOME FLED AWAY IN THEIR SHIPS AND AT THE END KING HARALD HAD WON THE BATTLE
NOW IN DENMARK THERE IS BUT ONE GREAT KING OVER THE WHOLE LAND
FEW MEN WROTE OR READ IN THOSE DAYS
ALL THE LAND THAT THEY DRAIN IS MINE AND NO MAN SHALL CLAIM IT BUT ME
THESE ARE NOT MEN SOME ONE CRIED
ERIC IT IS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR LAUGH AGAIN THEY SAID
AT LAST EVERYONE WAS ABOARD
WHERE DID THE STORM MEET YOU
SOON THE MEN FROM THE CANOES LANDED AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE NORSEMEN
PERHAPS WE CAN SOMETIME GO BACK TO NORWAY FOR FLOUR AT LAST ONE DAY THE THRALLS CAME HOME AND SAID
WHY IS THIS AEGIR'S ROCK HE ASKED
IN THE BOTTOM WERE LAID SOME LONG HEAVY HEWN LOGS
APPLETON CO NEW YORK ICELAND GREENLAND AND THE FAROES HARPER BROS NEW YORK CUSTOMS VIKING AGE DU CHAILLU
I WONDER WHY I HAD NO SUCH BAD LUCK LEIF SAID
STILL HARALD SAT ON THE STEP BEFORE THE HIGH SEAT
LET US GO ABOUT AND FIND OUR DEAD ILLUSTRATION
IN THE SKY ABOVE I SEE FAIR ASGARD'S SHINING ROOFS THE FLYING HAIR OF THOR THE WINGS OF ODIN'S BIRDS THE ROAD THAT HEROES TREAD
SHE IS EVER ITCHING TO BREAK HER PEACE-BANDS[14 AND BE OUT AND AT THE PLAY
BIARNI GOT A BROKEN ARM
ONE MAN AMONG THEM SEEMED TO BE CHIEF
LEIF AND HIS SWORD DO LAUGH AT THAT THEY SAILED FOR DAYS AND SAW NO LAND
SLOWLY KING ARNVID'S MEN FELL BACK BEFORE HARALD'S BITING SWORD
YOU ARE TOO GOOD A MAN TO GO TO NIFLHEIM
FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT LEAVE IN SHAME
THEY TELL US ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT OLDEN TIME
FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD

FOR ON THE HALF DECK IN THE STERN OF EVERY SHIP STOOD THE CAPTAIN WITH HIS SHIELD-GUARD OF A DOZEN MEN
I WILL BUILD A HOUSE HERE TO LIVE IN WHILE I LOOK FOR THE POSTS
VIKING TALES
ON THE VERY NEXT DAY KING HARALD SENT OUT HIS WAR-ARROWS
THE ELDEST OF YOU SHALL HAVE MY FARM WHEN I DIE
OLAF THRALL OF HALFDAN BUT HARALD'S CLOTHES WERE GAY
I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH THEN I DRANK HALF OF THE HORNFUL AND SENT THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER
I WILL FIGHT FOR MY FOSTER-BROTHER WHENEVER HE SHALL NEED ME
MORE THAN ONE FELL BY HIS FRIEND'S SWORD
I SMELL A BATTLE HE CRIED
WM
THE HEAD OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT WHO PLANNED THIS COURSE SAYS IT IS IN A SENSE A DRAMATIZATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING IS A BARE TOPICAL OUTLINE OF THE WORK
A LITTLE LAKE WAS THERE
I EMPHASIZE THEM HERE HOPING THAT THE TEACHER WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE CHILDREN SEE THEM AND POSSIBLY THAT THEY STATE THEM ABSTRACTLY
ALONG THE SHORE AND IN THE WOOD BACK OF THE HOUSE WE FOUND ALL OF HIS MEN DEAD
THEY WALKED ABOUT THE HALL
I THREW BACK MY HEAD AND LAUGHED
BUT COME HOME WITH ME HELGA SO THEY TOOK THE WOMEN AND LEIF'S THINGS AND LEIF'S BOAT AND SAILED HOME
THEY HAD GONE FAR SOUTH PAST MANY FAIR SHORES WITH WOODS ON THEM WHEN GUDRID SAID ONE DAY
IN NORWAY THE BABY 15 THE TOOTH THRALL 19 OLAF'S FARM 27 OLAF'S FIGHT WITH HAVARD 40 FOES'-FEAR 47 HARALD IS KING 53 HARALD'S BATTLE 62 GYDA'S SAUCY MESSAGE 71 THE SEA FIGHT 81 KING HARALD'S WEDDING 89 KING HARALD GOES WEST-OVER-SEAS 95 PART II
GUIDE THEM TO A GOOD PLACE O THOR HE CRIED
THEY LIVED IN A CAVE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
SHALL I NEVER HEAR YOUR MERRY LAUGH AGAIN
WHERE ARE YOU GOING INGOLF WOULD CALL
I SAY LET US STEER FOR ICELAND WHEN HE STOPPED MANY OF THE MEN SHOUTED
WE CAN NOT LIVE HERE SO THEY WENT ON AGAIN
NO WHITENING OF YOUR CHEEK HARALD
BUT THE KING STOOD IN THE VERY DOORWAY AND FOUGHT
SOMETIMES IT WAS SMOOTH AND SHINING UNDER THE SUN
OH THIS IS GOOD TO SEE HELGA CRIED
I AM SICK FOR DEAR OLD NORWAY IT IS THOR'S FAULT INGOLF CRIED
THE HUTS THAT THEY BUILT WERE LITTLE THINGS
THEN HE LEAPED INTO KING ARNVID'S BOAT ALL ALONG THE LINE OF BOATS MEN FOUGHT FOR HOURS
BY THOR CRIED THORSTEIN I SEE THAT YOU ARE READY FOR BETTER WOUNDS
THE QUEEN WORE A TRAILING DRESS OF BLUE VELVET WITH LONG FLOWING SLEEVES
HE STEERED FOR IT
ILLUSTRATION LEIF AND HIS NEW LAND NOW ERIC HAD LIVED IN GREENLAND FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
THEY ARE GETTING THE HAZELS SAID THORSTEIN
I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND
VICTORY FLASHES FROM THAT DRAGON HARALD'S MEN SAID POINTING TO THE KING'S HELMET
HE FELL AGAINST THE WOODEN WALL AT THE BACK AND A CARVED PANEL SWUNG OPEN BEHIND HIM
THOR AND HAVARD THEN THERE WAS A GREAT BEATING AT THE DOORS
I HAVE NEVER SEEN NORWAY OUR MOTHER LAND
NORSE STORY IS ONLY ONE CHAPTER IN THAT TALE OF AMERICAN DISCOVERY
WE MUST GIVE OUR MESSAGE BEFORE ALL HIS GUESTS SO THEY WENT IN WITH VERY HEAVY HEARTS
HE CAME CLOSE TO KING ARNVID AND CALLED
THEY SAW THE ISLAND THAT THEY HAD SAILED AROUND THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE FIERCE WIND BLEW DIRT INTO MY EYES AND THE COLD OF IT FROZE THE MARROW IN MY BONES
ALL THAT MAKES BIG MANLY BOYS
BIG ROLF-GO-AFOOT AND ALL HIS MEN SAILED UP THE GREAT FRENCH RIVER AND WON A BATTLE AGAINST THE FRENCH KING HIMSELF
THAT CAUSED TROUBLE
THEN ARNVID HIMSELF LEAPED DOWN AND STOOD WITH HIS SWORD RAISED
SO THEY HARRIED THE COAST OF KING HARALD'S COUNTRY
HERE HUNG THE SHIELDS OF THE GUESTS
FOR NORSEMEN ATE ONLY TWICE A DAY AND THESE MEN HAD HAD LONG RIDES AND WERE HUNGRY
MEN WERE STANDING ON THE FLAT TOP OF THAT ISLAND
FAR BELOW WAS A SOFT GREEN VALLEY
THE TREES IN ICELAND ARE LITTLE INGOLF SAID
AH MY FOSTER-BROTHER HE THOUGHT SHALL I NOT HAVE YOU TO CHEER ME IN THIS EMPTY LAND
ONE SPRING AFTER THEY HAD BEEN IN THAT LAND FOR FOUR YEARS ERIC SAID
HE HAS NOT ONLY WHIPPED THE VIKINGS BUT HE HAS GOT A NEW KINGDOM WEST-OVER-SEAS THEN THEY TALKED OF THAT DREAM THAT HIS MOTHER HAD
AFTER THAT ALL PEOPLE CALLED HIM HARALD SHOCKHEAD
SOME MEN CARRIED AXES IN THEIR BELTS
WE CHUCKLED AT THAT
YOU ARE WELCOME TO ALL OF IT
PERHAPS THEY COME FROM THE LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND ONE DAY ERIC SAID
BUT I AND HAKON AND ONE OTHER WERE ALL THAT REACHED THE SHIP
I AM EAGER FOR THE FROLIC SO THORSTEIN RAISED A WHITE SHIELD ON HIS SPEAR AS A SIGN THAT HE CAME ON AN ERRAND OF PEACE
AND WOULD HE NOT BE A GOOD GIFT FOR OUR BABY YOUR FATHER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN LOOKED AT YOUR MOTHER AND SMILED
3 SEE NOTE ABOUT DRINKING-HORNS ON PAGE 195
BESIDES THESE WERE STOREHOUSES STABLES WORK-SHOPS A KITCHEN A SLEEPING-HOUSE FOR THRALLS
THE TIMBERS CRACKED
IN FRONT OF THIS TEMPLE THE MEN KILLED TWO HORSES FOR ODIN
ALL MEN CAME BY SEA
AND IT IS STILL SUMMER THORHILD SAID
ONE OF THE STRANGERS WENT DOWN TO THEIR CANOES AND SOON CAME BACK WITH AN ARMLOAD OF FURS--FOX-SKINS OTTER-SKINS BEAVER-SKINS
WHILE THIS TRADING WAS GOING ON AND EVERYBODY WAS GOOD-NATURED A BULL OF THORFINN'S RAN OUT OF THE WOODS BELLOWING AND CAME TOWARDS THE CROWD
THEN HE SAW THAT LEIF'S SHIP WAS BEING DRIVEN AFAR OFF AH SAID INGOLF'S WIFE ONE DAY DO YOU REMEMBER THE GAY FEAST THAT WE HAD AT YULE-TIME
ALL THE YOUNG OF MY HERDS LAMBS AND CALVES AND COLTS THAT HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE THIS BABY WAS BORN I THIS DAY GIVE TO HIM
THEN THEY LAID LONG BOARDS ACROSS FROM TRESTLE TO TRESTLE
A CAPE OF GRAY VELVET HUNG FROM HIS SHOULDERS
TELL THEM THAT NO ONE SHALL GO AWAY EMPTY-HANDED SO IN THREE MONTHS MEN CAME RIDING UP AT EVERY HOUR
KING HARALD'S MEN PUT THEIR SHIELDS BEFORE THEIR MOUTHS AND SHOUTED INTO THEM
SMITH ELDER CO LONDON 1863 ICELAND GREENLAND AND THE FAROES HARPER BROS NEW YORK AN AMERICAN IN ICELAND KNEELAND
SO THORFINN CUT THE CLOTH INTO PIECES AND SOLD EVERY SCRAP
IT IS A VERY WHITE GREENLAND BUT MEN WILL LIKE THE SOUND OF IT
STREW THE FLOOR WITH PINE BRANCHES
MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE
SAY ALSO THAT IF A MAN DOES NOT OBEY THIS CALL OR IF HE RECEIVES THIS ARROW AND DOES NOT CARRY IT ON TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOR HE SHALL BE OUTLAWED FROM THIS COUNTRY AND HIS LAND SHALL BE TAKEN FROM HIM HE GAVE ARROWS TO THE OTHER TWO MEN AND TOLD THEM TO RUN SOUTH AND EAST WITH THE SAME MESSAGE
LOOK KINDLY ON US FROM YOUR HAPPY SEATS IN ASGARD THEN THEY WENT INTO THE FEAST HALL
I MEAN TO TAKE SOME OF THE THINGS OF THIS LAND TO SHOW TO OUR PEOPLE AT HOME
THE HISTORICAL VALUE OF THE STORY OF LEIF ERICSSON AND THE OTHERS SEEMS TO ME TO BE NOT TO LEARN THE FACT THAT NORSEMEN DISCOVERED AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS DID BUT TO GAIN A CONCEPTION OF THE CONDITIONS OF EARLY NAVIGATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE VOYAGE OF THE DANGERS OF THE SEA AND A CONSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THE REASON FOR THE FACT THAT AMERICA WAS UNKNOWN TO MEDIAEVAL EUROPE OF WHY THE NORSEMEN DID NOT TRAVEL OF WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO BE DONE BEFORE MEN SHOULD STRIKE OUT ACROSS THE OCEAN
FOR HARALD HAD BEEN DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS
DURING THE WARM SEASON THEY USED TO FISH AND MAKE FISH-OIL AND HUNT SEA-BIRDS AND GATHER FEATHERS AND TEND THEIR SHEEP AND MAKE HAY
ON ONE SIDE WAS THE BRIGHT ICE MOUNTAIN
DOES THIS NOT FLASH LIKE A SWORD
ON THE DAY SET THE FIELDS ABOUT KING HARALD'S HOUSE WERE FULL OF MEN AND HORSES
WITH A LAST LEAP HE LANDED NEAR HIS SKEES
SHALL WE DIE HERE IN THIS EMPTY LAND WITH NO ONE TO BURY US
BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT SUCH THINGS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO MEN WHO DO NOT SACRIFICE TO THE GODS
FOR MY CUPBOARDS ARE EMPTY OH THAT IS EASILY MENDED THORFINN SAID
SO THEY TOSSED ABOUT ALL NIGHT BUT IN THE MORNING THE WIND DIED DOWN
HE WENT THROUGH THE FEAST HALL IN FRONT TO A LITTLE ROOM AT THE BACK
SO THEY LAID ALL THE DEAD TOGETHER THERE ON THE HILL-TOP
IN NORWAY THEY LEFT BURNING HOUSES AND WEEPING WOMEN IT IS LIKE BEING ALWAYS IN A BOAT THEY SAID
HIS FOE THORGEST HAS MANY RICH AND POWERFUL MEN TO BACK HIM NO NO SAID ANOTHER
THORBIORN MEANS THOR'S BEAR
WHY LOOK
THE TWO ARMIES GALLOPED DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND RAN TOGETHER
AT THE END OF THE FEAST INGOLF HAD HIS THRALLS DIG THESE PILLARS UP
MANY A MAN SAID
IT WAS A STEEP ROCK LIKE THAT ONE IN THE FAROES BUT THEY FOUND A HARBOR AND LANDED AND CLIMBED THE STEEP HILL AND CAME OUT ON TOP
ABOVE MOST MEN'S HEADS SHONE THE POINTS OF THEIR TALL SPEARS
HE AND SOME OTHERS RAN UP THERE
THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED
THEY WERE THE FRONT POSTS OF THE CHAIR
NO HOUSE COULD FEED EIGHTY MEN SO LONG AND NOT FEEL IT
THOSE ICELANDERS CLAPPED THEM ON THE SHOULDERS BUT AFTER A WHILE INGOLF LED THEM TO THE FEAST HALL AND HAD A FEAST SPREAD AT ONCE
WE WILL FIGHT WITH HIM AND TAKE HIS LAND SO THEY BEGAN TO MAKE READY
SO THE MEN FURLED THE SAIL AND TOOK DOWN THE MAST AND LAID IT ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
I WANT TO FEEL THE WARM DAYS AND SEE THE SOFT GRASS AND THE HIGH TREES AND TASTE THE GRAPES OF THIS WINELAND THE GOOD THEN HE TALKED WITH HIS MEN AND WITH BIARNI
NOW LET US MAKE THE MOUND EVERY MAN SET TO WORK WITH WHAT TOOLS HE HAD AND HEAPED EARTH OVER THE DEAD UNTIL A GREAT MOUND STOOD UP
AUDUN SAID KING HARALD TO A MAN NEAR HIM STAY CLOSE TO MY STANDARD ALL DAY
THERE ARE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS WHERE WE MAY FIND ADVENTURE
PERHAPS GIANTS OR DRAGONS OR STRANGE MEN MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS INLAND ICE AND KILL OUR PEOPLE
THEY ARE UGLY PERHAPS BROWN FACES ARE LOOKING AT US NOW FROM BEHIND THE TREES IN THE WOODS BACK THERE SAID BIARNI
THEY WERE THREE AGAINST ONE OR THEY MIGHT HAVE TASTED SOMETHING MORE BITTER AT OUR HANDS
THESE ARE MY TOOTH-GIFTS TO MY SON THE BOY GREW FAST FOR AS SOON AS HE COULD WALK ABOUT HE WAS OUT OF DOORS MOST OF THE TIME
SHE IS VERY BEAUTIFUL THEY SAID BUT SHE IS VERY PROUD TOO
OUR FOOD MAY RUN SHORT
PERHAPS ONE WOMAN SAID AS SHE HANDED A MAN HIS HORN
I HUNGER FOR NEWS OF NORWAY SO THEY WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND STAYED THERE FOR THREE DAYS
MEN WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PLAIN AND TALKING
THEY PUT UP THE AWNINGS IN THEM
ILLUSTRATION KING HARALD'S WEDDING IT HAD TAKEN KING HARALD TEN YEARS TO FIGHT SO MANY BATTLES
HE RULED IT WELL AND WAS A GREAT LORD AND HIS SONS SONS AFTER HIM WERE KINGS OF ENGLAND
OUR VOWS KEEP RINGING IN MY EARS AT LAST THE LONG GLOOMY WINTER PASSED AND SPRING CAME
HE RODE NEAR KING HAKI BUT HE COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL HE CAME CLOSE BEFORE HE SHOUTED OUT HIS MESSAGE AND THEN TURNED AND RODE BACK
THEY HAD NO WINDOWS AND IN THE DOORWAYS THE MEN HUNG THEIR CLOAKS INSTEAD OF DOORS
GIVE ME A SWORD SHE CRIED
I HAD THOUGHT THAT A MAN'S BLOOD IS PRECIOUS IN THIS EMPTY LAND BUT MY VOW IS MORE PRECIOUS NOW THEY LAID ALL THOSE MEN TOGETHER AND TIED ON THEIR HELL-SHOES
OLAF'S MEN COULD HAVE SET HEAVY THINGS AGAINST THESE DOORS OR HAVE PUT PROPS AGAINST THEM
THEN HE STOOD UP BEFORE THE PILOT'S SEAT AND SANG LOUDLY
WITH THIS HOLY HAMMER OF THOR'S I HARALD KING OF NORWAY TAKE YOU GYDA FOR MY WIFE THEN HE TOOK A BUNCH OF KEYS AND TIED IT TO GYDA'S GIRDLE SAYING
THE VIKINGS WOULD COME AND STEAL OUR GOLD AND OUR GRAIN AND BURN OUR HOUSES OR THE KING WOULD CALL US TO WAR
QUICK
SOMETIMES THERE WERE TWO OR THREE MEN OF THE SAME NAME IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
16 SEE NOTE ABOUT VALKYRIAS ON PAGE 198
WHAT DO YOU SAY COMRADES HAVE I NOT VOWED TO FOLLOW YOU FOSTER-BROTHER SAID LEIF
SHE CAN BOTH READ AND MAKE RUNES
WE WENT UP TO HIM
SEE HE CRIED
SEA-HORSES REARED OUT OF THE WATER
I CALLED HER WAVERUNNER THERE SHE SAT ON THE ROLLERS AS FAIR A SHIP AS I EVER SAW
I THOUGHT THAT THE BRANCHES OF THIS GREAT TREE SPREAD SO FAR THAT THEY COVERED ALL NORWAY AND EVEN MORE A STRANGE DREAM SAID KING HALFDAN
AND NO WONDER
GUDRID HAD SAID
SWORDS ARE JEALOUS
WELL HE LAUGHED THIS HAS BEEN THE BUSIEST WINTER I EVER SPENT AND THE MERRIEST
I WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD TELL US AND HE STROKED HIS BEARD IN THOUGHT
THERE THEY STAYED FOR A YEAR
SOME LEAVES ARE LOST SOME ARE TORN ALL ARE YELLOW AND CRUMPLED
THEY SAW NO HOUSES ON ANY OF THE ISLANDS BUT THEY SAW SMOKE RISE FROM ONE HILLSIDE
PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND NOW I HAVE A PLAN ERIC SUDDENLY SAID
THE MEN WENT OUT UPON IT TO HUNT WHITE BEAR AND SEAL
THIS IS SICKLY STUFF INGOLF SAID
GAILY PAINTED DRAGONS LEANED OUT FROM THE DOORS AND STOOD UP FROM THE GABLES
I AM HUNGRY FOR NEW FACES AND FOR TIDINGS OF NORWAY ONE NIGHT AS HE AND HIS MEN SAT ABOUT THE LONG FIRE IN THE FEAST HALL A SERVANT THREW A GREAT PIECE OF WOOD UPON THE FIRE
ON ONE OF THESE STONES KING HARALD MADE RUNES TELLING HOW THESE MEN HAD DIED
MEN LOOSED THE ROPE THAT HELD THE BOATS
IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME AND WORK
HERE STOOD WOODEN STATUES OF THE GODS IN A SEMICIRCLE
THE MAN STRUCK THEM WITH HIS HAND AND SANG OF KING HALFDAN OF HIS BATTLES OF HIS STRONG ARM AND GOOD SWORD OF HIS DEATH AND OF HOW MEN LOVED HIM
NOW SET UP THE POLE THORSTEIN
SOON THEY PULLED THE SHIP UP ON THEIR OWN SHORE
THEY FILLED THEIR SHIPS WITH GOLD
AT THE FIRST SOUND OF THE HARP AND THE VOICE MEN CAME RUNNING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS CRYING OUT
IF THIS SHIP MOVES FROM HERE HE SAID THEN I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MOOR A SHIP
GREAT ROCKS HUNG OUT FROM THEM WITH TREES GROWING IN THEIR CRACKS
I HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH THEN HE STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS HIGH SEAT AND STOOD BY ERIC
WHERE WILL HE GO NOW I WONDER THIS ERIC STRODE DOWN TO THE SHORE WITH HIS MEN FOLLOWING
HE GREW FAST AND SOON CREPT ALONG THE YELLOW SAND AND TODDLED AMONG THE GRAPEVINES AND CLIMBED INTO THE BOATS AND LEARNED TO TALK
WHEN THE TABLES WERE TAKEN OUT AND THE MEAD-HORNS CAME ROUND I STOOD UP AND RAISED MY HORN AND SAID TO THE FARMER
THE SHIELDS OF HARALD'S WARRIORS HAD DENTS FROM VIKING BLOWS
THE FINDING OF WINELAND THE GOOD REEVES
WE WILL TRY ANOTHER SO HE STEERED TO ANOTHER
EDMONSTON DOUGLAS EDINBURGH 1861 VIKINGS OF THE BALTIC A ROMANCE DASENT
EVERY VALLEY WAS SPOTTED WITH BRIGHT FEAST HALLS AND TEMPLES
THEY HAD NO FORKS SO THEY ATE FROM THEIR FINGERS AND THREW THE BONES UNDER THE TABLE AMONG THE PINE BRANCHES
I WILL NOT WASTE MYSELF ON A KING OF SO FEW PEOPLE
AGAIN IN FORM AND IN MATTER OLD NORSE LITERATURE IS WELL WORTH OUR READING
LEIF NOTICED TWO STRANGERS AN OLD MAN WHO SAT AT ERIC'S SIDE AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE CROSS-BENCH
THEY HUNG HIS SWORD OVER HIS SHOULDER
FOR THEY HAD RIDDEN SLOWLY TRYING TO MAKE SOME PLAN FOR SOFTENING THE MESSAGE BUT THEY HAD THOUGHT OF NONE
YES THE KING KEEPS FEAST GUTHORM SAID
BUT YOU HAVE A BETTER SHIPLOAD THAN I GOT HE WAS LOOKING AT THE BUNDLES OF FURS AND THE KEGS OF WINE
HE FOUND AS BRAVE MEN AS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM NORWAY
C
WHEN THE GUESTS SAT BACK SATISFIED HARALD CALLED TO THE THRALLS
I SAW IN MY MIND THE FLOWERS THAT WE FOUND LAST SUMMER
INGOLF CAUGHT SOME OF THE BLOOD IN A BRASS BOWL
THERE ARE GREEN VALLEYS
STILL THE STORM CAME FAST
HIS EYES DANCED AT THE FUN
THEN HE SET OUT AGAIN TO LOOK FOR THE PILLARS BUT HE HAD NO BETTER LUCK AND CAME BACK
YOU SHALL BE CALLED HARALD HAIRFAIR IT IS A GOOD NAME EVERYBODY CRIED
THEY WENT TO THEIR HUTS AND DRESSED THEIR WOUNDS AND THE WOMEN HELPED THEM
IT SEEMS LIKE MY OLD HOME IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID
SHE HAS SHUT NORWAY TO ME AND NOW ICELAND
THEY RETURN AT EVENING NEAR MEAL TIME
THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE THEY SAID
GUDROD MEANS GUNNR'S LAND-CLEARER
OH WAR-LOVER HE CRIED YOU AND I RIDE OUT ON A GAY JOURNEY A HORN BLEW AGAIN AND THE ARMY STARTED
LOCKWOOD BROOKE CO BOSTON 1876 GREENLAND
GIVE THIS MESSAGE TO YOUR KING HARALD FOR ME
FOR THEY WERE GOOD STRONG MEN
THEY MADE THE HALL LOOK ALL THE BRIGHTER WITH THEIR CLOTHES OF SCARLET AND BLUE AND GREEN WITH THEIR FLASHING GOLDEN BRACELETS AND HEAD-BANDS AND SWORD-SCABBARDS WITH THEIR FLYING HAIR OF RED OR YELLOW
NOW HE WAS FEASTING ONE DAY AT AN EARL'S HOUSE
WHAT MAN WANTS TO SPEND THE WINTER WITH NO GUESTS AH ANOTHER THEN CRIED OUT SITTING UP
YOU ARE ALL GROWN TO BE MEN
THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER
I WILL FOLLOW THIS LAD AND I WILL NOT TURN BACK SO LONG AS HE AND I LIVE ON THE NEXT MORNING WE GOT INTO MY DRAGON AND STARTED
THE SKALD
THE SKALD
HOW IS IT
THE ROCK STOOD UP LIKE A RAGGED TOWER BUT HE DID NOT STOP BECAUSE OF THE STEEP CLIMB
WELD AN IRON COLLAR ON HIS NECK SO I LIVED AND NOW AM YOUR TOOTH THRALL
PEOPLE THOUGHT OF TWO WAYS OF MAKING IT EASY TO TELL WHICH MAN WAS BEING SPOKEN OF
YES THE SONG SHOUTED THE MEN AND HARALD NODDED HIS HEAD
AND I AM NOT AFRAID
LUCK HAS TAKEN US INTO ITS OWN HANDS ERIC LAUGHED
THAT ARCH OF SOD KEEPS RISING BEFORE MY EYES
I HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS MEAN HOUSE FOR WEEKS

FOOTNOTES
THERE CAN SURELY BE NOTHING BUT BIRDS NESTS ON TOP OF THAT SIGHVAT SAID
FOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED WAS THE THICK OUTSIDE WALL OF THE FEAST HALL AND THERE WERE NO WINDOWS IN IT
MORRIS AND MAGNUSSON
FOR INSTANCE A CARVED WOOD PIN-TRAY OR A COPPER MATCH HOLDER
THERE WAS I WED
RAND MCNALLY CO CHICAGO 1902 NORTHERN MYTHOLOGY THORPE
THERE WAS LAUGHTER THROUGH HIS HOUSE ALL THE TIME
RAN IN HER CAVES UNDER SEA WANTS US FOR COMPANY TO-NIGHT INGOLF LAUGHED
THE HOUSE RANG WITH SONG AND LAUGHTER
FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
AND MANY OF KING HARALD'S WARRIORS WALKED THE LONG HARD ROAD TO VALHALLA AND FEASTED THERE WITH SOME OF THESE VERY VIKINGS THAT HAD DIED IN KING HARALD'S BATTLES
WHEN HE DID THAT HIS MEN SHOUTED
IS THIS LAND NOT NEW ENOUGH AND EMPTY ENOUGH AND FAR ENOUGH
SOON HE HAD CHOPPED DOWN THE TREE AND HAD CUT A STRAIGHT POLE TEN FEET LONG AND AS BIG AROUND AS HIS ARM
ERIC LED HIS WIFE THORHILD AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF
THEN THE CHIEF POINTED TO ONE OF THE HUTS AND WALKED TOWARD IT
THEY HAVE CRAGS AND CAVES AND DEEP WOODS
ALL PEOPLE WERE TALKING OF HIS WONDERFUL BATTLES
I THINK THAT ODIN STOOD UP BEFORE HIS HIGH SEAT AND WELCOMED THAT MAN GLADLY WHEN HE WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR OF VALHALLA SO THE SONGS SAY REPLIED OLAF FOR SKALDS STILL SING OF THAT DEED ALL OVER NORWAY DECORATION ILLUSTRATION OLAF'S FARM AT ANOTHER TIME HARALD ASKED
AND I THOUGHT ONCE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER LEAVE WINELAND ALIVE THORFINN ANSWERED
BUT WHEN HE WENT SOMEWHERE ON AN ERRAND OF PEACE AND HAD NO QUARREL HE TIED HIS SWORD INTO ITS SCABBARD WITH WHITE BANDS THAT HE CALLED PEACE-BANDS
OUR SWORDS ARE SISTERS IN BLOOD AND WE ARE BROTHERS IN ADVENTURE
THEY WAITED FOR THE STARTING HORN
TELL YOUR BOY KING THAT WE WILL NOT HANG BACK HAKI CALLED AFTER THORSTEIN
THE WAVES CAUGHT THEM UP AND ROLLED THEM ABOUT
HERE COMES SOMETHING THAT WILL BE A WELCOME GUEST TO MY STOMACH THE THRALLS WERE BRINGING IN A GREAT POT OF MEAT
IT IS A GOODLY YOUNGSTER HE SAID AND SMILED
I CALL ODIN AND THOR AND ALL THE GODS TO HEAR MY VOW
I HAVE PUT MY FIRE AT THE MOUTH OF THESE RIVERS
SOME MEN WORE HELMETS SOME DID NOT
NOW WE ARE INDEED IN WINELAND THEY SAID
THEY CAME BACK EVERY WEEK OR TWO AND ALWAYS HAD TO SAY THAT THEY HAD NOT FOUND THEM
THE STRANGERS HAD LANDED AND WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE NORSEMEN
ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIORD HIGH WALLS OF ROCK STOOD UP AND MADE THE WATER BLACK WITH SHADOW
SAUCY TOO HE SAID
FOR THE KING AND ALL HIS MEN WERE RUNNING TO THE SHORE
AND AMONG ALL THESE CURVED NECKS STOOD UP THE TALL STRAIGHT MASTS WITH THE LONG YARDARMS SWINGING ACROSS THEM HOLDING THE LOOPED-UP SAILS
IN THE SUMMERS THEY SAILED BACK THERE AND HARRIED THE COAST
BESIDES WHEN HARALD HEARS OF OUR DEED THERE WILL NOT BE A SAFE PLACE IN NORWAY FOR US
OLAF SKIMS THE WAVES
IT WAS NEVER SO GLOOMY WHEN YOU WERE BY MY SIDE
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AND SCOWLED THEN LAUGHTER AND TALKING BEGAN IN THE HALL BECAUSE ERIC'S GOOD TEMPER HAD COME BACK
THEN HE SACRIFICED THREE HORSES THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO THOR
BACK OF IT WERE BARE BLACK AND RED HILLS
SOME WERE EDGED WITH FUR
I SHOULD LIKE TO SAIL AROUND THAT BAY SAID BIARNI POINTING
ERIC STROLLED INTO HIS HOUSE AND CALLED FOR SUPPER
FEW MEN HAVE EVER BEEN ON THE SEA SO LONG THAT NIGHT THEY PUT UP THE AWNING IN THE BOAT AND SLEPT UNDER IT
THERE WERE NO UNIFORMS
SOME WERE TALKING OF KING HARALD
A LITTLE GREEN VALLEY SLOPED UP FROM IT
WHEN AFTER THREE DAYS THE FOG LIFTED THEY FOUND THAT THEY HAD BEEN GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND THEY HAD TO TURN AROUND AND SAIL ALL THAT WEARY WAY OVER AGAIN
NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER
WE ARE READY THEY ALL SAID
LEIF SHALL SIT IN THE PLACE OF HONOR SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC
AS IT GREW WARMER THE ICE IN THE SEA BEGAN TO CRACK AND MOVE AND MELT AND FLOAT AWAY
AT LAST THE ESKIMOS WERE ON THE VERY SHORES OF THE COLD SEA WITH THE INDIANS STILL PUSHING THEM ON
ON THE NEXT NIGHT GYDA SAT ON THE CROSS-BENCH WITH HER WOMEN
WELCOME TO SHETLAND
THE OLD MAN'S EYES OPENED WIDE AT ALL THESE THINGS AND AT THE SAME TIME HE LAUGHED
DOWN THE MOUNTAINS HE WENT TWENTY THIRTY FEET AT A SLIDE LEAPING OVER CHASMS A HUNDRED FEET ACROSS
OLD SIGHVAT GRUMBLED
SHE WAS TALL AND STRAIGHT AND STRONG
WOLF MEETS WOLF TO-DAY HE SAID
AND ALL NIGHT THEY FEAST AND THEIR WOUNDS HEAL
THE STOREHOUSE WAS EMPTY
THE FOX HAS NOT BEEN ASLEEP KING ARNVID BLEW HIS HORN
THERE ARE THE VERY WORDS THAT THE MEN OF ICELAND WROTE SO LONG AGO--STORIES OF KINGS AND OF BATTLES AND OF SHIP-SAILING
THEY PILED STONES ON THE TOP
I GO TO AN EMPTY LAND THERE WAS THE SAME LONG VOYAGE WITH STORM AND FOG
NOW HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT THE HALL
IT WAS TWO FEET LONG AND SHARP ON BOTH EDGES
HE SHALL BE CALLED HARALD MY LORD OWNS HIM FOR HIS SON SHE SAID
WHEN IT WAVED IN THE WIND A SCARLET LINING FLASHED OUT AND THE BOTTOM OF A LITTLE SCARLET JACKET SHOWED
THAT I WILL BE OR I WILL DIE THEN HE DRANK OFF THE HORN OF MEAD AND WHILE HE DRANK IT ALL THE MEN IN THE HALL STOOD UP AND WAVED THEIR SWORDS AND SHOUTED AND SHOUTED
HARALD SHOUTED AND SWUNG HIS POLE
IT WAS THE LOCKED SHIELDS OF THE MEN IN THE BOWS AND OVER EVERY SHIELD LOOKED FIERCE BLUE EYES
HE HAS OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDER THAN HE CAN DO BUT OTHERS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET WITH THEIR MEAD-HORNS IN THEIR HANDS
I WILL SUN MYSELF IN A WARM LAND THEY SAILED ON AND PAST THOSE SHORES THAT LEIF HAD SPOKEN OF
HE THREW OFF HIS SKEES AND THRUST HIS HANDS AND FEET INTO HOLES OF THE ROCK AND DREW HIMSELF UP
AROUND HIS NECK WAS AN IRON COLLAR WELDED TOGETHER SO THAT IT COULD NOT COME OFF
THEY WERE CLUTCHING THEIR NAKED SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS
I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR GIANTS
I AM YOUR KING AND I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU MANY KINGS TOOK THAT OATH AND THOUSANDS OF COMMON MEN
I WILL NOT HAVE MY PEOPLE TROUBLED WITH ROBBER VIKINGS THE EARLS DID ALL THESE THINGS AS BEST THEY COULD
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
THEIR KINSMEN HUNGER TO KILL US
IN A MINUTE HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE HOLE AGAIN
NORSE WARRIORS WALKED UP AND DOWN THE LAND AND NO MAN DARED TO SAY THEM NAY
HE IS BUT A LAD
GREAT WAVES STILL ROLLED AND FOR DAYS THE SEA WAS ROUGH BUT THEY COULD PUT UP THE SAIL
THEN WOULD RING OUT A GREAT LAUGH FROM THAT BOAT AND THIS ANSWER
SOON THEY CAME
AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN
NOT ONCE ALL THAT WINTER DID THEY STIR OUT OF SIGHT OF SOME OF US
IT MUST BE DARK SO WE DUG UP DIRT FROM THE EARTH FLOOR AND SMOTHERED THE FIRE
1 SEE NOTE ABOUT HOUSE ON PAGE 194
YOU SHALL COME TO MY HOUSE AND REST YOUR LEGS FROM SHIP-GOING AND FILL YOUR STOMACHS
THERE ARE MY FATHER'S BONES
WHAT OF THAT FAR ISLAND THAT FLOKI FOUND
EVER HUNGRY FOR NEW FROLIC
ON THE NEXT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER FEAST
THEN WE SHALL HAVE SOME MERRY TIMES YET
HE SENT HIS RAVEN[12 TO TELL US
I HARALD KING OF NORWAY TAKE YOU GYDA FOR MY WIFE HARALD JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
WHEN THE WORK WAS DONE THEY PUT INTO HER GREAT STORES AXES HAMMERS FISH-NETS COOKING-KETTLES KEGS OF ALE CHESTS OF HARD BREAD CHESTS OF SMOKED MEAT BRASS KETTLES FULL OF FLOUR SKIN BOTTLES OF WATER
THE ENDS OF THE LOGS THE DOOR-POSTS THE PEAKS OF GABLES WERE CARVED INTO SHAPES OF MEN AND ANIMALS AND WERE PAINTED WITH BRIGHT COLORS
HARALD AND VICTORY SO HE CAME TO THE BOW AND STOOD SWINGING HIS SWORD AS FAST AS HE BREATHED
BUT SOME YOU SHALL KEEP FOR YOURSELVES
WE WERE BUSY GOING THROUGH THE CUPBOARDS AND SHOUTING AT OUR GOOD LUCK
THEY KNELT AND CLASPED HANDS SO THAT THE BLOOD OF THE TWO FLOWED TOGETHER AND THEY SAID NOW WE ARE OF ONE BLOOD THEN EACH MADE THIS VOW
I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
I WILL HAVE HER FOR MY WIFE SO HE CALLED HIS UNCLE GUTHORM AND SAID
THEN A MAN STOOD UP AND SAID
MOST OF THE LAND IN OLD NORWAY WAS COVERED WITH FORESTS
WITH LIGHTNING AROUND THEM WITH BLOODY SHIRTS OF MAIL AND WITH SHINING SPEARS THEY RIDE THROUGH THE AIR AND THE OCEAN
IN THIS HE SET UP THOSE STATUES THAT HAD BEEN IN HIS OLD TEMPLE
SOME EVEN LEAPED INTO THE ENEMY'S BOAT
ITS DIRT FLOOR ITS BARE STONE WALLS ITS LITTLENESS ITS DARKNESS
IF A MAN IS OLD AND IS COME NEAR DEATH AND CANNOT DIE IN FIGHT LET HIM FIND DEATH IN SOME BRAVE WAY AND HE SHALL FEAST WITH ME IN VALHALLA SO ONE DAY AEGIR CAME TO THIS ROCK
HE IS IN A BLACK TEMPER THEY SAID
THIS PILE WE WILL GIVE TO THOR IN THANKS FOR THE VICTORY HE SAID
I AM OLD
IT IS EMPTY
GRAPES
ONE DAY AS ERIC SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT HE SAID
IT WAS THE WISH OF ALL TO GO HOME
8 SEE NOTE ABOUT FOSTER-FATHER ON PAGE 197
I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT
ON THE BREAST AND SIDES I CARVED THE DRAGON'S SCALES
THORFINN OPENED HIS CHESTS AND SHOWED ERIC GLEAMING SWORDS AND BRACELETS AND AXES AND FARM TOOLS
I WILL NOT KNEEL BEFORE HIM AND PROMISE TO BE HIS MAN
AS THE SKALD STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS HIGH POSITION SOME RICH MAN WOULD RUSH UP TO HIM AND SAY
ONE WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE BLACK BECAUSE HE HAD BLACK HAIR
GREEN AND GOLD SNAKES COILED UP
THIS CAPE OF MINE CAME IN A VIKING BOAT FROM FRANCE
SOMETIME I WILL MAKE A BRAVE VOW LIKE THAT DECORATION FOOTNOTES
RAN HAD A GREAT NET AND SHE CAUGHT IN IT ALL MEN WHO WERE SHIPWRECKED AND TOOK THEM TO HER CAVE
SUPPOSE THE NAME OF EACH WAS HAKI
AND NEXT TO THAT IS A HILL OF ROCK THAT SEEMS TO HAVE COME OUT OF SOME GREAT FIRE
FOR MY LAND I WILL PAY YOU TAXES
AS THEY SAILED TOWARD IT IT GREW INTO LONG STRETCHES OF BLACK HILLY SHORE WITH A BLUE ICE MOUNTAIN RISING FROM IT
BEHIND THEM WALKED MANY OF KING HARALD'S GREAT EARLS
THESE GAY BUILDINGS WERE CLOSE TOGETHER OFTEN SET AROUND THE FOUR SIDES OF A SQUARE YARD
HE HAS DONE MORE THAN HE VOWED TO DO PEOPLE SAID
HE WATCHED THEM LAND AND LOOKED THEM ALL OVER
MY SWORD IS MY GOD AND MY SHIP IS MY TEMPLE AND I LIKE THIS LAND TO SET THEM UP IN THEY SAT ABOUT THE FIRE LONG THAT NIGHT MAKING PLANS
BUT HARALD'S SWORD STRUCK HIM AND HE FELL DEAD
WE COULD CHOOSE OUR LAND FROM THE WHOLE COUNTRY
I THINK WE SHALL FIND THEM ON THOSE ISLANDS THEN HE WENT BACK TO LEIF AND STOOD LOOKING AT HIM
AS SHE WALKED HER TRAIN MADE A PLEASANT RUSTLE AMONG THE PINE BRANCHES
AS THE WIND FILLED THE GAUDY SAILS AND THE SHIPS MOVED OFF THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE WOMEN ON SHORE AND SANG
THE NEXT SPRING ERIC SAID
THOSE LITTLE KINGS ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING
WHILE THE IRON WAS HOT HE BEAT INTO IT SOME RUNES
THEY DID NOT TALK
SOMETIMES A HIGH FENCE WITH ONE GATE WENT AROUND ALL THIS AND ONLY THE TALL CARVED PEAKS OF ROOFS SHOWED FROM THE OUTSIDE
THIS HORN HAS NO FEET TO BE SET DOWN UPON
THEY WERE ALWAYS HONORED WITH GOOD SEATS AT A FEAST
EVOLUTION OF THE FORMS OF BOATS
I NEVER KNEW SO GENEROUS A HOST BEFORE
ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS
HERE IS WHAT WE GOT FROM THE FOE THEY SAID
IT MADE A GREAT ROARING WAR-CRY
HARALD HAD KILLED HIS FATHER IN BATTLE
THE FLOOR WAS CLEAN WITH SWEET-SMELLING PINE-BRANCHES
WE CAN BECOME THIS SHOCKHEAD HARALD'S THRALLS WE CAN KNEEL BEFORE HIM AND PUT OUR HEADS BETWEEN HIS KNEES
OFTEN HE WENT WITH THE MEN A-HUNTING IN THE WOODS AND LEARNED TO RIDE A HORSE AND PULL A BOW AND THROW A LANCE
HE LOOKED AT THIS AND THAT AND EVERYTHING AND LOVED THEM ALL BECAUSE IT WAS NORWAY
AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM
THE PLACE IS STILL CALLED REYKJAVIK
WHEN THEY ROWED TO SHORE A CERTAIN SHETLAND MAN STOOD THERE
IT IS MY SWORD'S FAULT
THIS IS SURELY A WONDERFUL LAND INGOLF SAID ONCE
AH WE WILL HAVE A FEAST OFF THAT BEAR SO THEY TOOK THEIR SPEARS AND WENT OUT INTO THE WOODS
I DO NOT WELL KNOW WHERE THIS LAND IS ERIC SAID
WIFE AND LAND AND CROWN AND VICTORY IN BATTLE
THE TRUNK WAS RED WITH THE BLOOD OF HIS MANY BATTLES BUT HIGHER UP THE LIMBS WERE FAIR AND GREEN LIKE THIS GOOD TIME OF PEACE
AND HIGHER UP THERE WAS ANOTHER ROW OF GLEAMING SPEAR-POINTS
I ILLUSTRATION
THE CHILDREN SAT ON THE DIRT FLOOR CLOSE BY THE FIRE
THORSTEIN TAUGHT HIM TO SWIM IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF THE FIORD
KING HARALD AND SOME CRIED
SHALL I NOT SEE VALHALLA NOW THUS DID ODIN SAY LONG AGO
5 SEE NOTE ABOUT BEDS ON PAGE 196
SLOWLY HIS BOATS CAME INTO LINE WITH HIS SEA-STAG IN THE MIDDLE
HELLO HE CRIED
HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND
THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS RECLUS
THE EARTH AND ITS INHABITANTS RECLUS
YOU SHALL TASTE OF OUR SACRIFICE HE SAID
WE HAVE BAD NEWS THEY SAID
THEN TO THORKEL WELL LET HIM GO THORKEL THEN HE TURNED TO ME AGAIN FROWNING
THESE THEY PUT BEFORE THE GUESTS AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLES
WE HAVE MORE TO EAT THAN WE HAD IN GREENLAND OR ICELAND THORFINN SAID AND NEED NOT WORK AT ALL
I WILL TELL YOU OF OUR FIGHT WITH KING HAVARD HE SAID
NO MAN HAS REALLY LIVED UNTIL HE HAS SEEN NORWAY SO HE HELPED LEIF FIT OUT A BOAT AND SENT HIM OFF
KEGAN PAUL TRENCH TRUEBNER CO LONDON STORY OF BURNT NJAL INTRODUCTION DASENT
MEN WERE IN THEM PADDLING TOWARD SHORE
NOW ARE HARALD KING OF NORWAY AND GYDA DAUGHTER OF ERIC MAN AND WIFE THEN THRALLS BROUGHT MEAT AND DRINK IN GOLDEN DISHES
THEN INGOLF TOOK THE PILLARS OF HIS HIGH SEAT AND THREW THEM OVERBOARD
HE POINTED TO THE WOODS AND LAUGHED AND ROLLED HIS EYES WHY ARE YOU SO LATE HE ASKED
AT FIRST HE ONLY WATCHED THE MEN OR WORKED THE BELLOWS BUT SOON HE COULD HANDLE THE TONGS AND HOLD THE RED-HOT IRON AND AFTER A LONG TIME HE LEARNED TO USE THE HAMMER AND TO SHAPE METAL
FOR IN THE DARK AND THE NOISE THE MEN COULD NOT TELL THEIR OWN SOLDIERS
THEN THE MEN SAT AND TALKED OVER PLANS
MAY THEY HATE ME IF I BREAK IT RAN RAN WAS THE WIFE OF AEGIR WHO WAS GOD OF THE SEA
I HAVE BEEN HUNGRY BUT I HAVE NEVER DIED OF IT
HERE THEY MADE LAWS AND PUNISHED MEN FOR HAVING DONE WRONG
BUT AS SOON AS MY HOUSE AND TEMPLE ARE BUILT I WILL SACRIFICE TO YOU THREE HORSES AS A THANK-OFFERING IT IS A LONG WAY OFF MASTER THE THRALLS SAID AND WE HAVE FOUND MUCH BETTER PLACES IN OUR WALKS ABOUT THE ISLAND THOR KNOWS BEST INGOLF ANSWERED
WE RAN BACK AND HID BEHIND SOME TUBS IN A DARK CORNER
WHY WE ARE ALL STUPIDS
WHAT LANDS HAVE YOU SEEN O DRAGON'S HEAD
OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS HAPPENED AFTER ERIC WENT TO GREENLAND
THE ROOMS WERE EMPTY
AS FOR ME I AM HAPPY TO COME BIARNI AND ALL THE REST SAID THE SAME THING
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE STABLES
IT IS BETTER STUFF THAN GOLD THEN THEY SAW THE GRAPES AND TASTED THEM
WE SUNK HIS SHIP AND MEN BUT HIM WE BROUGHT TO YOU A ROBBER VIKING SAID THE KING AND SCOWLED AT ME
IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT HIS MEN SAID
KING HAVARD'S SHIPS ARE DEAD
HOW LITTLE OUR HOUSES LOOK DOWN THERE HARALD SAID
ON THE FLOOR OF THIS BOX WAS STRAW WITH BLANKETS THROWN OVER IT
STAND IN CLOSE LINE AND GIVE THEM A TASTE OF YOUR SWORDS EVEN AS HE SPOKE A GREAT SHOWER OF STONES FELL UPON THEM
IT IS ICELAND SHOUTED THE MEN
I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEY FORGOT WHICH WAY WAS NORTH
THERE WERE COVERS TOO FOR THE SMOKE-HOLES
BUT I HAVE FLOUR AND GRAIN AND MEAD IN MY BOAT
THE RIVETS WERE OF SILVER WITH STRANGELY SHAPED HEADS
EVERY MORNING HE WAS UP AT SUNRISE AND WENT WITH A THRALL TO FEED THE HUNTING DOGS
THE MEN CAME WALKING IN AT THE WEST END OF THE HALL.[6 THE GREAT BONFIRES DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WERE FLASHING LIGHT ON EVERYTHING
BESIDE THE TREASURE-CHEST THEY PILED UP MANY SWORDS AND SPEARS AND SHIELDS
LONG AFTERWARDS HOWEVER MEN BEGAN TO READ THOSE STORIES WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES AND TO WONDER
WE ARE AS GAY AS WE USED TO BE IN OLD NORWAY BUT IT WAS NOT MANY WEEKS BEFORE INGOLF SAID
THIS PILE IS MINE BECAUSE I AM KING
ONE DARK NIGHT WE HAD LANDED AT A FARM
ON SOME OF THEM A MAN CAN STAND IN THE MIDDLE AND SEE THE OCEAN ALL ABOUT HIM
I WISH TO HAVE HER FOR MY WIFE YOU SEEM TO BE A MAN WORTHY OF HER ERIC SAID
IT IS REALLY AN INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER
A CRUSADE AS A TALE OF TRAVEL AND DISCOVERY
THEY WAITED ON THE TABLE IN VALHALLA
THEY HUNTED IN THE WOODS AND CAUGHT RABBITS AND BIRDS AND SOMETIMES BEARS AND DEER
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE MUSIC OF SWORDS OLAF'S EYES BLAZED
FOR THREE NIGHTS THEY FEASTED AT ERIC'S HOUSE
WHEN THE STRANGERS GOT IT THEY TIED IT ABOUT THEIR HEADS AND SEEMED MUCH PLEASED
PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM IN WONDER
BY THOR THAT GUNNBIORN WAS A FOOLISH FELLOW
CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS NEW YORK 1892 AS FOLLOWS
LET EVERY MAN CARRY WHAT HE CAN SO THEY QUICKLY LOADED THEMSELVES WITH CLOTHES AND GOLD AND SWORDS AND SPEARS AND KETTLES OF FOOD
THERE FAR OFF IS MY COUNTRY ACROSS THE WATER
DID YOU MAKE NONE SIGHVAT THEN THEY WERE ON THE WATER AGAIN FOR WEEKS WITH NO SIGHT OF LAND
AT THE FEAST THAT NIGHT ERIC SAID
WHILE THEY SAT A STRANGER CAME INTO THE HALL
IT TOO WAS A STEEP ROCK BUT ONE SIDE SLOPED DOWN TO THE WATER AND WAS GREEN WITH GRASS
WE COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND
SUDDENLY MEN SAW HIS SAIL VEER AND HIS OARS FLASH OUT
SOME OF THEM SEEMED MADE ALL OF ROCK WITH A LITTLE EARTH LYING IN SPOTS
PART I ILLUSTRATION IN NORWAY DECORATION ILLUSTRATION THE BABY KING HALFDAN LIVED IN NORWAY LONG AGO
WHATEVER THINGS I OWN ARE AS MUCH MY FOSTER-BROTHER'S AS MINE
ALL THESE BUILDINGS WERE MADE OF HEAVY HEWN LOGS COVERED WITH TAR TO FILL THE CRACKS AND TO KEEP THE WOOD FROM ROTTING
WHY CARRY PROVISIONS WHEN THEY LIE IN THE FARMS BESIDE YOU AFTER TWO DAYS KING HARALD SAW ANOTHER ARMY ON THE HILLS
THEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UP AND THREW BACK HIS HEAD
THE WIND HOWLED THROUGH THE SHIP
THEN THEY TALKED GAILY AND DRANK TOGETHER
PUT UP BLACK AND GRAY ONES
THEN HE TURNED TO THE SHORE AND SANG OUT LOUDLY THEN HE TURNED TO THE SHORE AND SANG OUT LOUDLY
DESCRIPTIVE NOTES HOUSE IN A RICH NORSEMAN'S HOME WERE MANY BUILDINGS
AS HE DID SO A LEAN WOLF JUMPED AND SNAPPED AT HIM SNARLING
THE KING DIPPED HIS HAND INTO IT AND SPRINKLED THE BABY SAYING
THEIR CHIEF VALUE LIES IN HELPING THE TEACHER TO PIECE TOGETHER A PICTURE THAT SHE CAN FINALLY GIVE TO HER PUPILS
THEY BURNED FARMHOUSES BEHIND THEM
THEN HE LEAPED INTO KING ARNVID'S BOAT AND HIS WARRIORS FOLLOWED HIM
THAT WAS THE PLACE OF HONOR
A GREAT MANY MEN WERE ON THE SHORE MAKING A FIRE
THIRTY SWORDS ARE WAITING IN THERE TO EAT UP THE FIRST MAN WE HEARD SOME ONE SAY
THORFINN WALKED TO THE HOUSE WITH ERIC AND GUDRID WHILE THE OTHER MEN SAILED TO THE SHIP-SHEDS AND PULLED THEIR BOATS UNDER THEM
THEY TOOK THE HORNS WHEN THE THRALLS HAD FILLED THEM AND CARRIED THEM TO THE MEN WITH SOME MERRY WORD
SOON THEY CAME RUNNING BACK WITH THEIR HANDS FULL OF SOMETHING
I CAN BE NO WORSE OFF IN GREENLAND AND PERHAPS I SHALL GROW RICH THERE AND SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY LOVED ERIC AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS
BUT SOON A STORM CAME UP
MUST I DIE IN BED LIKE A WOMAN
WE MUST WRITE THEM DOWN TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING FORGOTTEN AFTER THAT MANY MEN IN ICELAND SPENT THEIR WINTERS IN WRITING BOOKS
THEY ARE NO PLACE NOW FOR FREE MEN SO BY THE TIME INGOLF WAS AN OLD MAN ICELAND WAS NO LONGER AN EMPTY LAND
NOW AM I NOT CAREFUL TO MAKE YOUR TIME GO MERRILY SO I SET GUARDS OVER EVERY ONE IN THAT HOUSE
THEN HE WAS GLAD
IN HIS SCARLET CLOAK HE LOOKED LIKE A FLASH OF FIRE
AS FOR THE OTHER STORIES THEY ARE DISTINCTLY STEPS IN THE PROGRESS OF THE PLOT
THEY PUT THEIR HEADS BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SAID
YESTERDAY I SAW A CAVE ON THE SEASHORE
A HIGH WALL RUNS ALL AROUND IT
AS THE FEAST WENT ON KING OLAF SAT IN HIS HIGH SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT THE HALL AND NOTICED THIS ONE AND THAT ONE AND SPOKE ACROSS THE FIRE TO MANY
I THINK IT IS A SECRET PASSAGE HE SAID
THAT OLD HALL IN ALL ITS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF FEASTS HAD NOT HEARD SUCH A NOISE BEFORE
FOLLOW ME IN DOUBLE LINE
THE TOPMOST BRANCHES WERE WHITE BECAUSE HARALD WILL LIVE TO BE AN OLD MAN
I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE
FOREIGN COLORED PHOTOGRAPHS OF NORWEGIAN LANDSCAPE ARE BECOMING COMMON IN OUR ART STORES
AT HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT SIT ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES AND AROUND THE HALL SIT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN ALL THE BRAVE ONES THAT HAVE EVER DIED
IT IS INGOLF'S GRAVE THEN MEN LAID INGOLF UPON HIS SHIELD AND CARRIED HIM AND PLACED HIM ON THE HIGH DECK IN THE STERN NEAR THE PILOT'S SEAT WHERE HE HAD SAT TO STEER TO ICELAND
AND THERE ARE SKALDS THAT SING WONDERFUL SONGS THAT MEN NEVER HEARD
THIS IS A GLORIOUS SIGHT THEY SAID
OH THIS IS NO KIND OF FIGHTING FOR BRAVE MEN THORFINN CRIED ANGRILY
YOU SHALL GO HOME AND GET OUR WOMEN AND OUR THINGS INGOLF SAID LEIF
THE OTHER WOULD BE CALLED HAKI THE SHIP-CHESTED BECAUSE HIS CHEST WAS BROAD AND STRONG
THEIR SWORDS AND SPEARS WERE GONE
YOU SHALL NO LONGER BE CALLED SHOCKHEAD
THEY SHOUTED APPLAUSE
GISLI THE OUTLAW DASENT
BUT THERE WERE INSTEAD COVERS MADE OF THIN OILED SKIN
THERE WAS NO GLASS IN THEM FOR THE NORSEMEN DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT
OH I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING SO GOOD AS THAT GREEN GRASS SINCE I LOOKED INTO MY MOTHER'S FACE ONE MAN SAID
HE TURNED TO HIS MEN AND SAID
MANY NIGHTS AS MEN SAT ABOUT THE LONG FIRES THEY TALKED OF THAT WONDERFUL LAND AND WISHED TO SEE IT
THE WIND SWEEPS HERE
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WERE FLAT STONES IN THE DIRT FLOOR
WHO WILL WRESTLE WITH ME SO THEY WRESTLED THERE AND RAN RACES AND SWAM IN THE WATER
I SEE LIGHT THROUGH THE WIND'S-EYES OF THE FEAST HALL ONE SAID
MONASTERIES AS CENTERS OF WORK
FROM HER SHOULDERS HUNG A LONG TRAIN OF SCARLET WOOL EMBROIDERED IN GOLD
DID I NOT SAY THAT I WOULD COME BACK WITH A FULL SHIP HE LAUGHED
WILL YOU DO IT BIARNI YES BIARNI ANSWERED AND TOOK THE FURS
IT IS LONG SINCE I FELT A BOAT LEAPING UNDER ME
AT LAST ONE SAID
THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN BEHIND THAT MOUNTAIN AND LONG LINES OF PINK AND OF SHINING GREEN AND GREAT PURPLE SHADOWS STREAKED THE BLUE
WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING
I LIKE THE COLD AIR OF THE SEA BETTER THAN THE BAD-SMELLING AIR OF A HOUSE EVEN THOUGH IT IS WARM NOW EVERY DAY INGOLF AND LEIF AND SOME OF THE MEN WALKED ABOUT THE ISLAND
MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN STAYED IN THE HOUSE AND CARDED AND SPUN AND WOVE AND KNIT
AT NIGHT THEY ALL SAT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AND TALKED OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN DURING THE DAY
IT WAS FROM LINK TO LINK OF THIS CHAIN THAT THE NORSEMEN SAILED IN SEARCH OF HOME AND ADVENTURE
THERE WAS A WIDE DESERT OF SAND AND BLACK AND RED ROCK WITH NOTHING GROWING ON IT
WE HAVE ALREADY BUILT OUR FIRES AND CLAIMED OUR LAND UP THE SHORE A WAY THE LEADER SAID
LEIF SAID
THEY HUNG HIS SWORD OVER HIS SHOULDER AND LAID HIS SPEAR BY HIS SIDE
ALL AROUND THE VALLEY WERE HIGH HILLS WITH DARK PINES ON THEM
I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF THIS WONDERFUL WINELAND SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE
ALL THIS TIME A SKALD STOOD BY AND PLAYED ON HIS HARP AND SANG A SONG ABOUT THAT TIME WHEN INGOLF CAME TO ICELAND
THIS IS THE SIGN THAT YOU ARE MISTRESS OF MY HOUSE AFTER THAT ERIC CALLED OUT LOUDLY
WHITE LINEN COVERED HER HEAD
I THINK I COULD FIND MY WAY THORFINN SAID
INGOLF WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSES CALLING ON HELGA AND ON THE THRALLS BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
THE SERVING-WOMAN PUT DOWN HER BUNDLE ON THE GROUND AND TURNED BACK THE CLOTH
SOLFI IN HIS SEA-HAWK WAS AHEAD LEADING THE WAY
SO THE SKALD TOOK DOWN HIS GREAT HARP FROM THE WALL BEHIND HIM AND WENT AND STOOD BEFORE HARALD
THE WOMEN WERE BUSY WEAVING AND SEWING NEW CLOTHES
10 SEE NOTE ABOUT FOSTER-BROTHERS ON PAGE 197
IT IS A LITTLE GIFT SO ERIC USED THOSE THINGS AND THERE WAS NEVER A MERRIER YULE FEAST THAN IN HIS HOUSE THAT WINTER
WHEN HE WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR OF THAT FEAST HALL ODIN MUST KNOW THAT A RICH AND BRAVE MAN COMES
THE WOLF DODGED BUT QUICKLY JUMPED AGAIN AND CAUGHT THE BOY'S ARM BETWEEN HIS SHARP TEETH
SOMETIMES THEY TOOK KNIVES FROM THEIR BELTS TO CUT THE MEAT
THEN THORFINN GAVE ERIC A GREAT SWORD WITH A GOLD-STUDDED SCABBARD
THORGEST IS OFF
THEN WE HEARD THE KING CALL TO THE MEN IN HIS BOATS LYING OUT IN THE WATER
EDMONSTON DOUGLAS EDINBURGH ORKNEYINGA SAGA ANDERSON
AND ARE NOT MANY OF US KINGS SONS
HE COMES IN PEACE THEN THORFINN SHOWED HIS EMPTY HANDS AND ASKED
THERE IS NO FRIEND LIKE MEAD
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM

THE JUDGES OUTLAWED HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID
THE STORY OF HARALD IS INTENDED TO SERVE IN TWO WAYS TOWARDS THE WORKING OUT OF THIS PLOT
OLAF WATCHED HIM FOR A WHILE THEN HE SAID
WHEN THE STRANGERS HEARD IT AND SAW IT THEY THREW DOWN WHATEVER WAS IN THEIR HANDS AND RAN TO THEIR CANOES AND PADDLED OFF AS FAST AS THEY COULD
THE OTHERS HAD DIED DURING THE WINTER
NEVER FEAR THEM GOOD WIFE NOW ONE DAY SOON AFTER THAT THE THRALLS CAME RUNNING TO THE HOUSE CALLING OUT
HE HAS KEPT HIS VOW MEN SAID AND GROUND HIS FATHER'S FOES UNDER HIS HEEL SO KING HARALD SAT IN PEACE FOR A WHILE

ALL THAT DAY LONG SWORDS WERE FLASHING SPEARS FLYING MEN SHOUTING MEN FALLING FROM THEIR HORSES SWORDS CLASHING AGAINST SHIELDS
FATHERS LOOKED AT THEIR CHILDREN AND THOUGHT
PERHAPS THAT IS OUR WHITE LAND ILLUSTRATION
SOME NAMES THAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS HAVE COME DOWN TO US IN JUST THAT WAY--SWANSON ANDERSON PETERSON JANSEN
THE PEOPLE RAN AWAY BEFORE THEM AND GATHERED INTO GREAT ARMIES THAT MARCHED BACK TO MEET THE VIKINGS IN BATTLE
THERE IS A LAKE THAT WE MUST SEE THORFINN SAID
HARALD HAS COME WEST-OVER-SEAS THE MEN OF THESE SHIPS SAID AND HAS LAID HIS HEAVY HAND UPON THE ISLANDS AND PUT HIS EARLS OVER THEM
HERE ARE SOME OF THOSE DOUBLE NAMES WITH THEIR MEANINGS
SOLFI HAD BEEN IN THAT BATTLE
I AM ASHAMED THAT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME YOU WILL HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU NEVER SPENT A WORSE YULE THAN YOU DID WITH ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND
AND IT IS SO IN SWEDEN
SOME OTHER MEN LIKE US WEARY OF THE SEA AND STOPPING TO REST SAID INGOLF
IF THEY STAYED AT HOME THEIR MOTHER WOULD SPOIL THEM WITH MUCH PETTING FOSTER-BROTHERS WHEN TWO MEN LOVED EACH OTHER VERY MUCH THEY SAID LET US BECOME FOSTER-BROTHERS THEN THEY WENT AND CUT THREE LONG PIECES OF TURF AND PUT A SPEAR INTO THE GROUND SO THAT IT HELD UP THE STRIPS OF TURF LIKE AN ARCH
CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS NEW YORK 1892 INGOLF
THERE IS GOOD FISHING
ALL THE TIME THE WEATHER WAS GROWING COLDER
TABLES BEFORE A MEAL THRALLS BROUGHT TRESTLES INTO THE FEAST HALL AND SET THEM BEFORE THE BENCHES
THERE HE GOES PEOPLE SAID AND TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM
THE OTHER WAS HAKI HALFDAN'S SON
ALL THE FREEMEN IN THE WEST OF ICELAND HAD COME TO A MEETING
FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN HE MIGHT NEED IT
THIS DID NOT LOOK LIKE OUR ARMY
BREW TWENTY TUBS OF FRESH ALE AND MEAD
AFTER THE MEAD-HORNS HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN ERIC STOOD UP FROM HIS HIGH SEAT AND WENT DOWN AND STOOD BEFORE KING HARALD
NORSEMEN IN ICELAND DASENT IN OXFORD ESSAYS VOL
HE WILL NEVER LET A MAN FIGHT OUT AN HONEST QUARREL
YOU WILL BE AS SUNNY AS THIS GOOD LAND I HOPE SHE SAID
HE HELD HIS DRINKING-HORN AND HIS SWORD HIGH IN HIS HANDS
LET EVERY MAN BRING TO THAT POLE ALL THAT HE TOOK FROM THE FOE SO THEY DID AND THERE WAS A GREAT HILL OF THINGS AROUND IT
HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT EXPECTED US BUT NOW THE FARMER WAS BLOWING ON THE COALS AND PUTTING ON FRESH WOOD
DID YOU HEAR IT FRIENDS
WE HAVE FRIENDS IN THE SHETLANDS HE SAID
YOU SHALL NOT GO AWAY EMPTY-HANDED
WHILE HE DRIFTED ABOUT HE SAW A STRANGE LAND THAT ROSE UP WHITE AND SHINING OUT OF A BLUE SEA
HOW IS IT FRIENDS HARALD SAID

THIS IS COLD WELCOME FOR YOUR GUESTS MY MEN LAUGHED
EVERYBODY SEEMED MUCH EXCITED
SO AFTER A WHILE THEY SAILED BACK TO THEIR HOME AND LIVED THERE
THE CLEAN SMELL OF THIS WOOD-SMOKE AND OF THE PINE BRANCHES ON THE FLOOR WAS PLEASANT TO THE GUESTS
WE SHALL TAKE HIM BY SURPRISE THEY SAILED NEAR THE COAST
SOME WENT TO FRANCE AND GOT LAND AND LIVED THERE
BUT NONE MAY GO TO VALHALLA EXCEPT WARRIORS THAT HAVE DIED BRAVELY IN BATTLE
ON THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST GYDA SAT BY HARALD'S SIDE

HO THRALLS I CALLED TO THEM
THEY LANDED IN THESE PLACES AND STRETCHED AND WARMED THEMSELVES AND ATE
TO THE SEA
TO THE SEA
IT IS PLEASANT TO SAIL ALONG THE COAST NOW SAID ERIC
AT THAT HE LAUGHED AND SAID
IF THE OMENS ARE GOOD WE WILL START TO-MORROW WELL GO FOSTER-BROTHER LAUGHED LEIF
IS IT SO ERIC CRIED LEAPING UP
THEY JUMPED UP AND RAN TO THE SHORE AND STOOD THERE WITH HUNGRY EYES
SO IT SEEMED A WONDERFUL THING TO THESE NORSEMEN
FROM A HOUSE YOU SEE A SOOTY ROOF FROM A SHIP YOU SEE VALHALLA
THE TWO SHIPS TOSSED ABOUT IN THE SEA WHEREVER THE WAVES SENT THEM
WE SHALL BE OUR OWN KINGS
FOR THE DOORS HE MADE AT THE FORGE GREAT IRON HINGES
AFTER THAT THEY WENT ABOARD THEIR BOAT AND SAILED FOR THE ISLANDS THAT INGOLF HAD SEEN
THEY MARCHED THROUGH THE COUNTRY NORTH AND SOUTH AND EAST AND WEST BURNING HOUSES AND FIGHTING BATTLES AS THEY WENT
SNORRI IS HIS SON
SURELY YOU MUST HAVE PLUNDERED ASGARD THEY SAID SMACKING THEIR LIPS
ALL WERE LEANING FORWARD WITH CLENCHED TEETH AND WIDESPREAD NOSTRILS
THERE WAS PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY THEN AND AEGIR SORROWED SAYING
WE HAVE ALL LAUGHED AT THAT TALE OF BUTTER THOROLF'S HE SAID
HE WAS STARING INTO THE FIRE
YOU MUST KEEP PEACE IN THE LAND
GUTHORM STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND
I THOUGHT THAT I STOOD IN THE GRASS BEFORE MY BOWER.[1 I PULLED A THORN FROM MY DRESS
ALL MEN SAID THAT THAT WAS THE RICHEST FUNERAL FEAST THAT EVER WAS HELD
IF ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MAKE HIM NEED HIS SWORD HE BROKE THE PEACE-BANDS AND DREW IT OUT

THE BITE OF THE SWORD IS SWEETER THAN THE KISS OF YOUR MOTHER HE SAID TO OLAF ONE DAY

SAGA OF HARALD HAIRFAIR IN SAGA LIBRARY MAGNUSSON AND MORRIS VOL
I SUPPOSE THAT THESE ARE THE FIRST HOUSES THAT WERE EVER BUILT IN WINELAND
THERE HE LIVED UNTIL HE DIED
COME ON
WHEN THE MEN WERE ALL IN THE QUEEN HARALD'S MOTHER AND THE WOMEN WHO LIVED WITH HER WALKED IN THROUGH THE EAST DOOR AND SAT UPON THIS BENCH
SO HARALD PUT ON HIS SKEES AND STARTED FOR A WOOD THAT WAS BACK FROM SHORE
HE IS SHOWING US THAT HE HAS NO WEAPONS BIARNI SAID
NOW FOR A LONG TIME THE KING'S HAIR AND BEARD HAD NOT BEEN COMBED OR CUT
I SEE AFAR OFF AN ICEBERG LARGER THAN ANY ONE YET
I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID
TELL ME WHETHER IT IS YOUR WILL THAT WE GO TO ICELAND AS HE SAID THAT A RAVEN FLEW OVER HIS HEAD
ALL THE MARSHLAND AND THE WOODLAND WHERE NO PEOPLE LIVE IS MINE
WHEN INGOLF DIED HIS MEN DREW UP ON THE SHORE THE BOAT IN WHICH HE HAD COME TO ICELAND
HARALD FOLLOWED CLOSE
AFTER A WEEK THEY CAME BACK AND INGOLF SAID
SO IN THE SPRING THEY FITTED UP THEIR TWO SHIPS AND PUT INTO THEM PROVISIONS AND A FEW CATTLE
THEN KING HARALD SAID LOOKING ABOUT
IS NO ONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE ALL OF NORWAY HIS OWN SHE LAUGHED A SCORNFUL LAUGH AND WALKED AWAY
HE BELTED HIS JACKET WITH A GOLD GIRDLE
THE NEXT DAY AFTER THEY CAME TO INGOLF'S HOUSE HELGA SAID
TWO WOLVES LIE AT HIS FEET
DONE INTO ENGLISH OUT OF THE ICELANDIC BY WILLIAM MORRIS AND EIRIKR MAGNUSSON
MEN CAN SEE A LONG WAY THERE BECAUSE THE AIR IS SO CLEAR
OUT WITH THE OARS SO WITH OARS AND SAIL AND RUDDER THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE CURRENT BUT IT TOOK THE BOAT ALONG LIKE A CHIP AND AFTER A WHILE THEY PUT UP THEIR OARS AND DRIFTED
CLOSE THE DOOR AFTER YOU
THE ROOF IS THATCHED WITH SHIELDS
A LONG VEIL OF WHITE LINEN COVERED HER FACE AND HEAD AND HUNG DOWN TO THE GROUND
DOWN WITH THE SAIL AND OUT WITH THE OARS INGOLF SHOUTED
I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM YOUR FRIEND EYJOLF
THERE IS ONE KING IN DENMARK AND ONE KING IN SWEDEN
BUT AFTER ALL THIS IS A BABY THING
I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU AS MY KING THEN HARALD SAID
HE HAMMERED OUT A GOLD BAND AND PUT IT AROUND THE JOINING PLACE
DISCOVERIES WERE MADE BY ACCIDENT
I HAVE KEPT MY VOW O THOR HE CRIED
SO THEY STARTED OFF ACROSS THE HILLS
ON IT WERE STRANGE MARKS CALLED RUNES THAT SAID
NO NOT THE SHETLANDS MY FOSTER-BROTHER.[10 THEY ARE CROWDED ALREADY
WELL AFTER WE HAD BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME HAKON CAME IN TO THE FEAST ONE NIGHT AND SAID
SMOKE CURLED UP FROM KITCHENS AND SMITHIES
TAKE HIM OUT THORKEL AND LET HIM TASTE YOUR SWORD YOUR MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS STANDING BY
WORK IS WAITING FOR ME AT HOME AND ON THE SEA
THE MEN TOOK OFF THEIR SWORDS AND LAID THEM DOWN AND CAME ONE BY ONE AND KNELT BEFORE THE KING
HE WALKS LIKE THOR THE FEARLESS HIS STORY WOULD MAKE A FINE SONG ONE SAID
ALL-WISE AND ALL-FATHER ODIN AND THOR WHO LOVES THE THUNDER I GIVE THESE HORSES TO YOU
SWORDS STRUCK OUT AT US AND WE STRUCK BACK
ONE OF THE THRALLS GAVE A GREAT LAUGH AND SHOUTED
FOR EVERY MAN WHEN HE WAS GIVEN HIS PLACE TURNED AND HUNG HIS SHIELD BEHIND HIM AND SET HIS TALL SPEAR BY IT
THE MEN ROWED IN AND QUICKLY JUMPED OUT AND PUT THE ROLLERS UNDER THE SHIP AND PULLED HER UPON SHORE
THEIR SONGS MADE THEM WELCOME EVERYWHERE
NOW START UP THE FIRE I SAID
THE STRINGS WERE SOME OF GOLD AND SOME OF SILVER
IN THE MORNING BEFORE INGOLF'S MEN STARTED AWAY THEY WERE STANDING HIGH UP ON THE HILLSIDE LOOKING ABOUT
THREE OR FOUR PERSONS ATE FROM ONE PLATTER AND DRANK FROM THE SAME BIG BOWL OF MILK
LEND A HAND SOME ONE THEN HE AND ANOTHER PULLED OUT A GREAT TUB THAT SAT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CUPBOARD
THE CATTLE PASTURED ON THE GRASS
SOME TIME AFTER THAT A SERVING-WOMAN CAME INTO THE FEAST HALL WHERE KING HALFDAN WAS
FAR OVER THE SEA TOWARD THE NORTH SHONE A GREAT ICE-MOUNTAIN
14 SEE NOTE ABOUT PEACE-BANDS ON PAGE 199
THEN THOSE NORSEMEN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF ANYTHING TURNED AND RAN
THEY TOOK GOLD AND GRAIN AND BEAUTIFUL CLOTH BACK TO THEIR HOMES
THE MEN'S FACES ARE BROWN LET EVERY MAN HAVE HIS SWORD READY CRIED THORFINN
IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID
THE SOUND OF THE SEA REACHES IT
IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT THING IF AT LAST THROUGH THE DRAMATIZATION AND THE HANDWORK THE CHILDREN SHOULD COME INTO SUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING AND ENTHUSIASM TO TURN SKALDS AND COMPOSE SONGS IN THE NORSE MANNER
HE WAS DEAD
THE SUMMER'S FISHING THE KILLING OF A FOX A VOYAGE TO NORWAY
THEIR ENDS CURVED AND SPREAD ALL OVER THE DOOR
I AM TIRED OF SITTING STILL
THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT IN THE SHIPS

AFTER THAT THEY BUILT A FIRE AND WARMED THEMSELVES AND COOKED A MEAL AND ATE LIKE WOLVES
WITH UPPER DOT X
WHEN YOU ARE A MAN HE SAID AND GO A-VIKING TO DENMARK ASK MEN WHETHER THEY EVER HEARD OF OLAF THE CRAFTY
WE MUST NOT FREEZE HERE SO THEY CHOSE A LITTLE SPOT WITH HILLS ABOUT IT TO KEEP OFF THE WIND
HE HAS TWO HUNDRED FIGHTERS WITH HIM SAID GRIM
THAT DAY LEIF SAID
THE KING'S MEN WENT GROPING ABOUT AND CALLING BUT THEY DID NOT FIND US
THEY MADE A HOUSE OUT OF STONES
SHE FED AND GREW TO TWICE HER SIZE THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND
A MAN OF MANY PLACES--NORWAY THE NORTH OF ICELAND THE WEST OF ICELAND THOSE LITTLE ISLANDS OFF THE SHORE OF ICELAND
I SHOULD DEEM IT A GREAT THING ACCOMPLISHED IF THE CHILDREN WHO READ THESE STORIES SHOULD SO BE TEMPTED AFTER A WHILE TO READ THOSE FINE OLD BOOKS TO ENJOY THE TALES TO APPRECIATE STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF STYLE
WHEN THE ICE COMES AND OUR DRAGON CANNOT PLAY THEN WE WILL GET OUR FARM AND SIT DOWN AT LAST THE WINTER CAME AND I SAID TO MY MEN
SO HER CAVE WAS FILLED WITH SHINING THINGS
THE MEN GATHERED EGGS HERE
O YOU BLOODY BIRDS OF BATTLE HE CRIED
IN HIS HAND THEY PUT HIS MEAD-HORN
AFTER A DAY OR TWO INGOLF SAID
WILL YOU MARRY GYDA NOW HE ASKED
IVAR THE FAR-GOER TELLS ME OF THE STRANGE COUNTRIES HE HAS SEEN
HENRY COLBURN LONDON 1840 ERIC LEIF AND THORFINN
THE PEOPLE CALL THEIR COUNTRY ARABIA
SOME WENT BECAUSE THEY WERE POOR IN ICELAND AND THOUGHT
THEY WERE ALL THINKING
THEY GUESSED AND TALKED TOGETHER AND STUDIED THIS AND THAT LAND AND READ THE STORY OVER AND OVER
I HAVE SEEN BEARS COME FLOATING SO TO THE NORTH SHORE OF ICELAND AN OLD MAN SAID
INGOLF SAT IN HIS HIGH SEAT FROWNING AND GLOOMY
NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME HE IS BUT A BOY THE MEN SAID
I WILL GO LOOK FOR MY PILLARS SO HE AND A FEW MEN GOT INTO THE ROWBOAT AND WENT ALONG THE SHORE AND INTO ALL THE FIORDS BUT THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PILLARS
BUT SOME MEN LAY DOWN ON THE BENCHES AND DREW THEIR CLOAKS OVER THEMSELVES
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN PLEASANT TO SEE HIS SAIL AND TO SHAKE HIS HAND AND TO WELCOME HIM TO ICELAND
IN THAT VALLEY INGOLF AND HIS MEN DREW UP THEIR BOAT AND CAMPED
WHAT DOES SHE SAY SHE SAYS THAT SHE WILL NOT MARRY SO LITTLE A KING GUTHORM ANSWERED
HE WAS SAILING FOR ICELAND BUT THE FOG CAME DOWN AND THEN THE WIND CAUGHT HIM AND BLEW HIM FAR OFF
DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE HALL STRETCHED LONG BACKLESS BENCHES WITH ROOM FOR THREE HUNDRED MEN
TO NORWAY WOULD COME BACK THE ANSWER
THEY WERE OFTEN VERY BEAUTIFUL AND A MAN WAS ALMOST AS PROUD OF HIS DRINKING-HORN AS OF HIS SWORD
I WILL CALL THIS PLACE REYKJAVIK."[13 THEN INGOLF BUILT HIS FEAST HALL
THEY LAID HIS SPEAR BY HIS SIDE
CHEER UP GOOD WIFE INGOLF SAID
THESE HE SENT ABOUT THE HALL AND GAVE SOMETHING TO EVERY MAN
THESE TWO POINTS,--THE ISLAND CONNECTION THAT MADE POSSIBLE THE LONG VOYAGE FROM NORWAY TO AMERICA AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF STORM TO DISCOVERY,--I HAVE STATED IN THE BOOK ONLY DRAMATICALLY
SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY-FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND
BETTER DAYS ARE COMING NOW BUT THAT SAME DAY THE THRALLS CAME BACK FROM LOOKING FOR THE POSTS
MANY COME TO NORWAY TO TRADE BUT THEY SELDOM COME TO THE KING'S HALL
AND OUR SHIPS WILL BE ALWAYS WAITING TO TAKE US AWAY WHEN WE ARE WEARY OF IT
A MAN WAS PROUD TO HAVE PEOPLE KNOW WHO HIS FATHER WAS
THEN THE MEN SWUNG THE SAIL TO THE WIND AND WE MOVED OFF
NORWAY IS A STRANGE COUNTRY
BUT SOME OF ERIC'S MEN WENT OFF IN THEIR BOAT ANOTHER WAY
THEY NAMED HIM SNORRI
THIS WORK SHOULD LEAD OUT INTO A STUDY OF THESE SAME INDUSTRIES AMONG OURSELVES WITH VISITS TO WOOD-WORKING SHOPS AND METAL FOUNDRIES
WELCOME TO GREENLAND CALLED ERIC
SO NOW KING HALFDAN WAS DEAD AND BURIED AND HARALD WAS TO BE KING
LUMBER
SO HIS HAIR GREW WHITE AND HIS ARMS THIN
ONE SPRING MORNING WHEN THE MEN GOT UP AND WENT OUT FROM THEIR HUTS TO THE FIRES TO COOK THEY SAW A GREAT MANY CANOES IN THE HARBOR
THEN THEY TOLD ALL THE STORY
TRUSTWORTHY PICTURES OF NORSE HOUSES AND COSTUMES ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
I WILL MAKE THIS LAND MINE SO HE BUILT FIRES AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER NEAR THERE AND STOOD BY THEM AND CALLED OUT LOUDLY
EVEN THE KING OF NORWAY WOULD SOMETIMES SEND ACROSS THE WATER TO ICELAND SAYING TO SOME FAMOUS SKALD
BUT ON THE WAY HE MET OTHER FOES AND HAD MANY BATTLES AND DID NOT LOSE ONE
AT LAST I STOOD UP AND SAID
CAN NO BAD FORTUNE SPOIL YOUR GOOD NATURE LAUGHED ERIC
LUMLEY LONDON 1851 CLASSIC MYTHS JUDD
I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM
I WILL GO TO THE KING HE SAID
OUR EARS ARE THIRSTY FOR SONG SO THE BEST SKALDS TRAVELED MUCH AND VISITED MANY PEOPLE
WE WILL GO IN HERE AND REST INGOLF SAID
WE CAN COME AND GO AND FEAST AND FIGHT AS WE PLEASE
PARKER SON LONDON 1858 ICELAND GREENLAND AND THE FAROES HARPER BROS NEW YORK A WINTER IN ICELAND AND LAPLAND DILLON
ONE DAY HE SAID
THEN THRALLS CAME RUNNING IN AND SET UP THE LONG TABLES[7 BEFORE THE BENCHES
WHERE WILL YOU GO NEXT OLD COMRADE AND HE PULLED OUT HIS SWORD AND LOOKED AT IT AND SMILED AS THE FIRE FLASHED ON IT
FEAST HALL THE FEAST HALL WAS LONG AND NARROW WITH A DOOR AT EACH END
BUT DRAMATIZATION WILL DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE INTERPRETING OF THE STORIES AND THE CHARACTERS
THERE WAS A LITTLE HARBOR THERE
BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN
IT IS A WELL-PACKED SHIP THE MEN SAID
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WERE QUIVERING THERE
THEY TOOK HORSES AND CATTLE WITH THEM AND ALL KINDS OF TOOLS AND FOOD
THEY WROTE ON SHEEPSKIN
TRAVELS IN THE ISLAND OF ICELAND BY MACKENZIE
AT LAST PEOPLE BEGAN TO WRITE MORE EASILY
6 SEE NOTE ABOUT FEAST HALL ON PAGE 196
SINCE IT IS TO MY HEALTH I WILL DRINK IT
HE TORE HIS JACKET AND CUT HIS LEATHER LEGGINGS AND SCRATCHED HIS FACE AND BRUISED HIS HANDS BUT AT LAST HE WAS ON THE TOP
LET US GO
SO THEY FOUGHT WITH THE CURRENT AND SAILED OUT OF IT AND WENT ON TOWARD LAND
THEN THE MEN RAISED A GREAT MOUND OVER ALL THE DEAD
THEY STOPPED IN A PATCH OF HAZEL AND HEWED WITH THEIR AXES
AT THE SAME TIME KING HAKI RAISED A RED SHIELD
NICHOLS CO SPRINGFIELD MASS 1895 DISCOVERY OF AMERICA FISKE VOL
NOW I AM ASHAMED THAT YOU SHOULD NOT FIND A HOUSE WORTHY OF YOU
THEN HE RAN AND SAT ON A ROCK BY OLAF
YOU ARE A WELCOME GUEST SO LEIF STAYED THERE THAT WINTER
PERHAPS THIS RIVER WILL CARRY US TO A WHIRLPOOL AND SUCK US UNDER THE MEN SAID
THEIR HOUSES SAT IN THESE STRANGE LANDS LIKE WARRIORS CAMPS AND THE NORSEMEN WENT AMONG THEIR NEW NEIGHBORS WITH HANGING SWORDS AND SPEARS IN HAND EVER READY FOR FIGHT
ERIC GAVE A HOLY HAMMER TO HARALD AND IT WAS LIKE THE HAMMER OF THOR
BUT IF I TAKE MY SPORT LIKE A WOLF I MUST BE HUNTED LIKE ONE
PEOPLE SAT AT THE OUTSIDE EDGE ONLY
AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED
ILLUSTRATION THE TOOTH THRALL WHEN HARALD WAS SEVEN MONTHS OLD HE CUT HIS FIRST TOOTH
AT A FEAST ONE DAY WHEN THE JOKES WERE GOING ROUND HARALD'S UNCLE SAID
I MUST STAY AT HOME AND SEE TO THE MAKING OF HAY AND THE DRYING OF FISH HE SAID
THIS REQUIRES ONLY A SMALL VOCABULARY AND A ROUGH FEELING FOR SIMPLE RHYTHM BUT AN INTENSITY OF EMOTION AND A GREAT VIVIDNESS OF IMAGE
ABOVE THE HALL THE RAFTERS WERE CARVED AND GAILY PAINTED SO THAT DRAGONS SEEMED TO BE CRAWLING ACROSS OR EAGLES SEEMED TO BE SWOOPING DOWN
THE HARDEST THING WAS TO GET FUEL FOR THE FIRE
SO GUDRID LIVES WITH ME NOW ALL THAT WINTER UNTIL YULE-TIME ERIC SPREAD A GOOD FEAST EVERY NIGHT
THE SOLDIERS OF THE SHIELD-GUARD ON THE HIGH DECKS BEGAN TO THROW DARTS AND STONES AND TO SHOOT ARROWS INTO THE SHIPS OPPOSITE THEM
THEY MAY PERHAPS MAKE SOMETHING TO MERELY ILLUSTRATE NORSE WORK
IT IS BETTER THAN ICELAND SO ERIC AND ALL HIS PEOPLE SAILED BACK AND SPENT THE WINTER WITH HIS FRIENDS
MEN FROM ALL OVER ICELAND CAME TO IT AND MADE LAWS
AND WE SHALL SEE THINGS THAT OTHER MEN HAVE NEVER SEEN
THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND FLASHED IT OVER HIS HEAD AND HELD HIS SHIELD HIGH ABOVE HIM AND LEAPED OUT INTO THE AIR AND DIED IN THE WATER OF THE FIORD HO CRIED HARALD JUMPING TO HIS FEET
AS THEY SAT ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE ONE NIGHT BIARNI SAID
HE SHALL BE CALLED HARALD 17 HE THREW BACK HIS CAPE AND DREW A LITTLE DAGGER FROM HIS BELT 22 I STRUCK MY SHIELD AGAINST THE DOOR SO THAT IT MADE A GREAT CLANGING 31 THEN HE TURNED TO THE SHORE AND SANG OUT LOUDLY 45 HE DROVE IT INTO THE WOLF'S NECK 51 I VOW THAT I WILL GRIND MY FATHER'S FOES UNDER MY HEEL 59 KING HAKI FELL DEAD UNDER FOES'-FEAR 68 I WILL NOT BE HIS WIFE UNLESS HE PUTS ALL OF NORWAY UNDER HIM FOR MY SAKE 73 THEN HE LEAPED INTO KING ARNVID'S BOAT 87 I HARALD KING OF NORWAY TAKE YOU GYDA FOR MY WIFE 91 IN NORWAY THEY LEFT BURNING HOUSES AND WEEPING WOMEN 97 THEN HE SAW THAT LEIF'S SHIP WAS BEING DRIVEN AFAR OFF 125 THOSE ICELANDERS CLAPPED THEM ON THE SHOULDERS 137 HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD OF HIM AND SCOWLED 145 MORE THAN HALF THE MEN IN THE HALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET 147 IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE 153 HE POINTED TO THE WOODS AND LAUGHED AND ROLLED HIS EYES 167 THE CHIEF HELD THEM
O THOR LET HIM NOT GO DOWN TO THE CAVES OF RAN
WHEN THE MEN LANDED THOSE ICELANDERS CLAPPED THEM ON THE SHOULDERS AND TEARS RAN DOWN THEIR FACES
HE CALLED HIM THE FATHER OF ICELAND
I WILL NOT STAY HERE BUT THEN I HAVE WALKED THROUGH BEAUTIFUL WARM VALLEYS WHERE THE WINDS DID NOT COME
FOSTER-FATHER A NORSE FATHER SENT HIS CHILDREN AWAY FROM HOME TO GROW UP
HIGHER UP AND FARTHER BACK WAS ANOTHER WALL OF SHIELDS
IT IS NO SHIP AND THERE IS NO ONE ON IT HIS MEN LAUGHED AND ONE CALLED TO ANOTHER AND SAID
THEY WERE WONDERFULLY CARVED AND PAINTED WITH MEN AND DRAGONS
AS THEY STARTED GUDRID STOOD ON THE DECK AND SANG
THREE TIMES THEY WALKED AROUND THE HALL
SOON THE SEA-ROAD BETWEEN HERE AND NORWAY WILL BE SWARMING WITH DRAGONS AND SO IT WAS
HE RIDES THROUGH THE SKY AND HURLS HIS HAMMER AT CLOUDS AND AT MOUNTAINS
FOR THEY SAID
THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON FOR THESE LAST NAMES
THE WORK LEFT THEIR MINDS FREE TO THINK AND THEIR LIPS TO TALK
AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID
BUT BY THE CHAIR OF ODIN I KEPT MY VOW YES CRIED HARALD JUMPING TO HIS FEET
WHAT DOES THE SWIMMING DRAGON SMELL
LET US CHOOSE A PLACE TO STAY AND BUILD A HUT THERE AND CUT HAY FOR OUR CATTLE SO THEY DID
SHE CAME UP AND SAID HOLDING HER HEAD HIGH AND CURLING HER LIP
FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POTFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET-LOADS OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID

HARALD AND VICTORY THEY SHOUTED AND WENT TO WORK AGAIN WITH GOOD HEART
NO TREES GREW THERE
THERE IS NOT ELBOW-ROOM HERE FOR SO MANY CHIEFS
I WILL FEAST MY EYES ON NEW THINGS ON MIGHTY TREES AND PURPLE GRAPES ON BEDS OF FLOWERS AND SOFT GRASS
WHEN THE HORNS CAME ROUND INGOLF MADE THIS VOW
ILLUSTRATION HARALD IS KING NOW WHEN HARALD WAS TEN YEARS OLD HIS FATHER KING HALFDAN DIED
THIS IS THE SUN'S OWN LAND IN THE BEGINNING OF THAT WINTER A LITTLE SON WAS BORN TO GUDRID AND THORFINN
EVEN AS WE WENT A SPEAR WHIZZED THROUGH THE AIR AND HAKON FELL DEAD
NOW FOR THE FARM
THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND
WE ARE ONLY WAITING FOR A LEADER THEN LET US GO CRIED THORFINN
HE IS THERE AHEAD
WHO WILL GO WITH ME MORE THAN HALF THE MEN IN THE HALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND WAVED THEIR DRINKING-HORNS AND SHOUTED
AND THERE IS ALWAYS A STORM ABOUT ME
WHEN YOUR PEOPLE ARE IN TROUBLE THEY SHALL COME TO YOU AND YOU SHALL SET THE THING RIGHT
WE MUST NOT HAVE EXTRA MOUTHS TO FEED
THE WAVES BROKE AT THE DOORSTEP
HE MADE NAILS WITH BEAUTIFUL HEADS AND DROVE THEM INTO THE POLE IN DIFFERENT PLACES
GRAIN GROWS WILD AND YOU YOURSELVES SAW THE GRAPES THAT WE GOT FROM THERE
THERE WAS I BORN
FOR THAT WAS THE KING'S SEAT
THEN THE THRALLS TOOK SOME OF THE GUESTS TO THE GUEST HOUSE TO SLEEP AND SOME TO THE BEDS AROUND THE SIDES OF THE FEAST HALL
AFTER SHIP MEETS SHIP IN THE QUARREL OF SWORDS KING HARALD SHALL LIE IN THE CAVES UNDER SEA AND NORSEMEN SHALL LAUGH IN THE PROW STOOD MEN LEANING FORWARD AND SNIFFING THE SALT AIR WITH JOY
IT IS LONG SINCE I HAD MY EYES ON A NEW DRESS SO THEY ALL WENT DOWN AND FOUND TWO LARGE TRADING SHIPS LYING IN THE WATER
ONLY THE BRAVEST AND THE LUCKIEST MEN COME HERE ERIC SAID
NOR IN ME SHOUTED THORKEL
HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN
I SAID THAT NO MAN SHOULD GO AWAY EMPTY-HANDED FROM DRINKING MY FATHER'S FUNERAL ALE HE BECKONED THE THRALLS AND THEY BROUGHT IN A GREAT TREASURE-CHEST AND SET IT DOWN BY THE HIGH SEAT
IF THESE SHOES COME UNTIED HE SAID I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FASTEN HELL-SHOES THEN HE WENT OUT OF THE SHIP AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH HIS FAMILY
I AM HUNGRY TO KNOW WHAT IS THERE THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND SAILED NORTH
FOR YOUR SAKE I SHALL NOT FORGET GREENLAND LEIF SAILED BACK AGAIN AND HAD GOOD LUCK UNTIL HE WAS PAST ICELAND
MANY MEN WISHED TO GO BUT INGOLF HAD SAID
MEN WHO DIE FROM SICKNESS GO WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND COWARDS TO NIFLHEIM
IS THERE NO MAN BRAVE ENOUGH TO MAKE HIMSELF KING OF ALL NORWAY
TO EYES GROWN TIRED WITH LOOKING FAR ALL AT ONCE APPEARED AN ISLAND A STRETCHING-PLACE FOR SEA-LEGS A QUIET BED FOR BACKS GROWN STIFF ON ROWING-BENCH ON ROLLING SEA
WE HAVE LOST OUR CUSTOMERS BIARNI SAID
SOON KING ARNVID'S SHIPS CRASHED INTO HARALD'S LINE AND IMMEDIATELY THE MEN IN THE BOWS BEGAN TO SWING THEIR SWORDS AT ONE ANOTHER
IF IT IS HEAVY IT WILL STRIKE HARD HE SAID
GOLD LACINGS WOUND AROUND HIS LEGS FROM HIS SHOES TO HIS KNEES
WE CANNOT TELL WHAT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US
COME UP AND SPEAK WITH ME SO LEIF WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE HIGH SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY THE KING AND TALKED WITH HIM
GREAT WAVES LEAPED IN THE SEA
HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER THORSTEIN WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM
IT IS A WONDERFUL CITY WHERE THE GOLDEN HOUSES OF THE GODS ARE IN THE GOLDEN GROVE
THEY SEEM TO LIKE MY CLOAK BIARNI SAID
INGOLF WATCHED IT
ALL THE MEN OF ICELAND WERE THERE
THEY ALL TALKED AND LAUGHED MUCH WHILE THEY WERE TOGETHER
AND I VOW THAT I WILL GRIND MY FATHER'S FOES UNDER MY HEEL THEN HE DRANK THE ALE AND SAT DOWN IN THE KING'S HIGH SEAT WHILE ALL THE MEN STOOD UP AND RAISED THEIR HORNS AND SHOUTED
YOU BEAR THIS LIKE A WARRIOR I THINK IT WILL NOT BE MY LAST HARALD SAID
WHY SHOULD HE PUT HIMSELF UP FOR KING OF ALL OF US
THE MEETING WAS OVER NOW
AND IN FARMHOUSES ALL THROUGH ICELAND THESE OLD TALES WERE TOLD OVER AND OVER UNTIL EVERYBODY KNEW THEM AND LOVED THEM
THE NEXT MORNING KING HARALD LED HIS ARMY BACK
ARE NORSEMEN NOT BETTER THAN THESE SAVAGES THEN THOSE WARRIORS STOPPED ASHAMED AND STOOD UP BEFORE THE WILD MEN AND FOUGHT SO FIERCELY THAT THE STRANGERS TURNED AND FLED DOWN TO THEIR CANOES AND PADDLED AWAY
I WITH FOUR MORE WILL GUARD THIS DOOR I SAID POINTING TO THE EAST END
GIVE IT INTO THE HANDS OF THE MASTER OF THE NEXT FARM AND SAY THAT ALL MEN ARE TO MEET HERE WITHIN TWO WEEKS FROM THIS DAY
WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY
MYTHOLOGY THE PROSE EDDA NORTHERN ANTIQUITIES PERCY EDITED BY BLACKWELL
NO HOPE OF THAT REPLIED INGOLF
WHAT ARE WE DOING
HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID
WE SHALL HAVE GOOD NEIGHBORS SOON OTHER HOUSES WERE BUILT ALONG THE FIORDS
MY EYES ACHE FOR SOMETHING NEW
HOW SHALL WE GIVE THIS MESSAGE TO THE KING I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THAT GUTHORM SAID
GUDRID LOOKED AT HER BABY AND SMILED
RUN AND CARRY THIS ARROW NORTH
I AM THORFINN HE SAID A TRADER
HE BUILT ALSO A TEMPLE AND ON THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL CARVING
SOME OF THOSE OLD STORIES I HAVE TOLD IN THIS BOOK
GUDBRAND MEANS GUNNR'S SWORD GUNNR WAS ONE OF THE VALKYRIAS[16
ON THE TOP OF EACH ONE WAS A LITTLE STATUE OF THOR WITH HIS HAMMER
YOU SHALL COLLECT THE TAXES AND PAY THEM TO ME
STORY OF VASCO DA GAMA
IT WAS EVENING WHEN THEY REACHED THEM
IT WAS AN UGLY FIGHT THOR WOULD NOT HAVE LOVED THAT BATTLE ONE SAID
COME AND VISIT ME
SOME ROBBER VIKINGS FROM SCOTLAND OR IRELAND LAUGHED LEIF
THAT GREAT TREE
NOW AFTER THREE WEEKS THE NORSEMEN SAW CANOES IN THE BAY AGAIN
WHO EVER SAW SUCH BOATS BEFORE
NOW WE MUST HAVE A NAME FOR OUR LAND
SOME CARRIED BOWS AND ARROWS
SO ALL THROUGH KING HARALD'S COUNTRY MEN WERE SOON BUSY MENDING HELMETS AND POLISHING SWORDS AND MAKING SHIELDS
THEY ARE NOT LEARNING MUCH
AFTER THE MEATS WERE EATEN AND THE MEAD-HORNS CAME ROUND I STOOD UP FROM MY BENCH AND RAISED MY DRINKING-HORN[3 HIGH AND SPOKE WITH A GREAT VOICE
LOOK AT OUR LONG FACES
HIS MEN FOLLOWED SILENT AND ASHAMED
THEY DREW UP THEIR BOATS ON THE RIVER BANKS
SEE THE GREAT TREES AND THE SOFT GREEN SHORE
BUT OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM AND SMILED SAYING
I AM GLAD HE IS OUT OF ICELAND JUST THEN A BIG MAN WITH BUSHY RED HAIR AND BEARD STALKED THROUGH THE CROWD
STAND AS WITNESSES HALFDAN SAID
OF ALL THE BATTLES THAT HARALD FOUGHT HE DID NOT LOSE ONE
I CANNOT GIVE YOU THAT
SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK
KING HARALD'S FINE SHIPS WERE SCARRED BY VIKING STONES AND SCORCHED BY VIKING FIRE
WELL I MUST OFF SOMEWHERE
HE WAS A KING'S SON
ALL OUR FRIENDS WERE THERE
HE PUT UP TOO THOSE PILLARS OF HIS HIGH SEAT THAT HAD BEEN DRIFTING ABOUT SO LONG
THE NORSEMEN LAUGHED
SO ON EACH WALL THERE WAS A LONG ROW OF GAY SHIELDS RED AND GREEN AND YELLOW AND ALL SHINING WITH GOLD OR BRONZE TRIMMINGS
THIS HURT HIS PRIDE
ALL MY MEN PUT THEIR HANDS TO THEIR MOUTHS AND SHOUTED
WHAT IS THIS CRIED THE NORSEMEN TO ONE ANOTHER
WHENEVER THEY SAW ANY INTERESTING PLACE THEY SAILED IN AND LOOKED ABOUT AND RESTED THERE
BUT HARALD RAN HIS BOAT INTO EVERY CREEK AND FIORD AND HUNTED IN EVERY CAVE AND THROUGH ALL THE WOODS AND AMONG THE CRAGS
MY EYES CAN SEE HER AT LAST THE MOTHER OF MIGHTY MEN THE FIELD OF FAMOUS FIGHTS
A SAGA THEY STOOD ABOUT FOR HOURS AND LISTENED
ILLUSTRATION OLAF'S FIGHT WITH HAVARD AT ANOTHER TIME HARALD SAID
DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY THAT GUNNBIORN TOLD
ERIC GOT INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT AND THEY SAILED OFF
HERSTEIN AND HOLMSTEIN DIED BY OUR SWORDS
WOULD IT NOT BE PLEASANT TO SEE OTHER FEAST HALLS AS WE SAIL ALONG THE COAST OH
AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT ONE OF THE MEN SAID
FEW WERE EAGER TO BE THE FIRST IN
HE IS SURELY WORTH KNOWING
15 SEE NOTE ABOUT ESKIMOS ON PAGE 199
HE DROPPED DOWN HEAD FIRST
VIKING SHIPS SAILED ALL THE SEAS AND MADE HARBOR IN EVERY RIVER
I MADE HER IN THE LIKENESS OF A DRAGON
THEY SAW THE TEN THRALLS SITTING ABOUT A BONFIRE EATING
YEARS AGO AEGIR WAS A GREAT WARRIOR
WHEN IT STRUCK THE WATER THEY MADE A ROPE FAST TO THE ROCK AND SLID DOWN IT INTO THE SHIP AND SAILED OFF
TO-DAY HE WILL BE LYING STILL DRESSING HIS WOUNDS AND MENDING HIS SHIPS
SO THE KING MADE ROLF A DUKE GAVE HIM BROAD LANDS AND GAVE HIM THE KING'S OWN DAUGHTER FOR WIFE
THE FIGHT HAD BEGUN
THEY WERE GIVEN MANY RICH GIFTS
I OWN THIS BABY FOR MY SON
I OWN THIS BABY FOR MY SON
AT LAST THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT WINELAND WAS IN AMERICA ON THE EASTERN SHORE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEY HAVE CALLED SNORRI THE FIRST AMERICAN AND HAVE PUT UP STATUES OF LEIF ERICSSON THE FIRST COMER TO AMERICA.[15 DECORATION FOOTNOTES
YES HE SAID
THE STORIES OF THE KINGS OF NORWAY CALLED THE ROUND WORLD HEIMSKRINGLA BY SNORRI STURLUSON
THEY WERE LIKE GREAT FLAMES OF YELLOW AND GREEN AND RED
I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN
THERE ARE GOOD ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE BOOK LIST
IN FRONT OF IT THE SEA CAME UP INTO THE LAND AND MADE A FIORD
WHERE SHALL WE GO MY MEN ASKED
THE ONLY LIGHT CAME THROUGH THESE NARROW HOLES SO ON DARK DAYS THE PEOPLE NEEDED THE FIRE AS MUCH FOR LIGHT AS FOR WARMTH
IT IS THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY
THE NEXT MORNING KING HARALD SPOKE TO HIS MEN
WHAT WAS YOUR MASTER'S NAME
BUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY ATE AND SLEPT BY A GREAT BONFIRE OUT OF DOORS WHERE IT WAS CLEAN
THE THRALLS HAVE DONE IT
WE WILL GO WITH YOU TO THIS STRANGE LAND SO ALL WERE READY AND THEY PUSHED OFF WITH ERIC'S FAMILY ABOARD AND THOSE FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED HIM
THE RAFTERS ARE SPEARS
WELCOME
THEY WERE CLIMBING STEEP ROUGH HILLS
SUCH A NOISE HAD NEVER BEEN IN THAT HALL BEFORE
SHADOWS FLITTED IN THE DARK CORNERS
SO AFTER A FEW DAYS THEY SAILED BACK TO GREENLAND WITH GOOD WEATHER ALL THE WAY
A HUNT
HE WAS A GREAT-GRANDSON OF HARALD HAIRFAIR
EYJOLF BIDS YOU COME TO HIM AND HE WILL HIDE YOU UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO START
THE BOTTOM OF THE HARP RESTED ON THE FLOOR BUT THE TOP REACHED AS HIGH AS THE SKALD'S SHOULDERS
A STORMY SEA AN EMPTY LAND HUNGER DARKNESS GIANTS FIRE
COME THEY CRIED THANK HIM FOR THAT FARMER
THAT WAS FAT AND EASY LIVING
IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT I SEE A GREENLANDER
SEA-HAWKS SAT WITH SPREAD WINGS READY TO FLY
SHE ALSO CAUGHT ALL THE GOLD AND RICH TREASURES THAT WENT DOWN IN SHIPS
I SAW THE WIDE ROUGH SEAS BETWEEN ME AND HARALD AND OUR FOES
PEACE-BANDS A NORSEMAN ALWAYS CARRIED HIS SWORD EVEN AT A FEAST
IT WILL BE AN EMPTY AND FORGOTTEN LAND AND SO IT WAS FOR A LONG TIME
ILLUSTRATION ERIC THE RED IT WAS A SPRING DAY MANY YEARS AFTER INGOLF DIED
VOICES WERE LOUD ARMS WERE SWINGING
THE REST OF YOU DOWN THE HOLE I SAID
THEN THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HAVE GOT OUT
ONE DAY THORFINN SAID TO ERIC
THE MEN HAD TO TAKE DOWN THE SAILS AND MASTS AND THEY COULD DO NOTHING WITH THEIR OARS
MEN IN NORWAY TALK MUCH OF INGOLF AND LEIF AND WONDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM THEN INGOLF TOLD THEM OF ALL THAT HAD COME TO PASS IN ICELAND
WHEN HE FIGHTS WITH THOSE HEROES DURING THE DAY HE MUST HAVE WEAPONS WORTHY OF HIM
KING HAKI'S MEN RODE DOWN INTO THE VALLEY
I SAW MY HOUSE BUILT AMONG GREEN FIELDS AND MY WIFE SITTING IN HER HOME AND MY CHILDREN PLAYING AMONG THE FLOWERS AND MAKING UP TALES ABOUT THE BRIGHT ICE MOUNTAINS
AFTER ABOUT TWO YEARS LEIF CAME BACK
TRANSLATED BY BARNARD
WE MUST TAKE THE GREAT BEAMS FOR OUR HOMES WITH US STANDING ON THESE LOGS WERE A FEW CATTLE AND SHEEP AND HORSES AND PIGS
THAT IS THE MAN WHO WENT TO WINELAND AND FOUGHT WITH WILD MEN THEY SAID
THE GUESTS WALKED IN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH THEIR BIG VOICES SO THAT THE RAFTERS RANG
THAT WAS A BRAVE VOW ILLUSTRATION
WHEN THEY STOOD ON THE TOP THEY COULD SEE FAR OVER THE COUNTRY
HE IS A LUCKY MAN DECORATION ILLUSTRATION KING HARALD GOES WEST-OVER-SEAS NOW MANY MEN HATED KING HARALD
HE IS A MAN FIT TO CARRY MY DRINKING-HORN THE HORN OF A SEA-ROVER AND A SWORD-SWINGER
METAL-WORKING AND WOOD-CARVING WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT ARTS OF THE NORSE
BACK OF THOSE PROWS WAS WHAT LOOKED LIKE A LONG WALL WITH SPOTS OF GREEN AND RED AND BLUE AND YELLOW AND SHINING GOLD
AT THE END OF IT HE FLED AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED MEN AND GOT INTO SHIPS
THEN LEIF CALLED HIS MEN AND SAID
FATHER-IN-LAW OUR HORSES STAND READY IN THE YARD
AS THEY CAME NEAR THE MEN SAID
WILL YOU NOT TAKE LEIF'S TWO HOUSES AND LIVE IN THEM
ALWAYS IN A QUARREL
NO ONE STANDS BEFORE IT AND SURELY BEFORE NIGHT CAME KING HAKI FELL DEAD UNDER FOES'-FEAR WHEN HE FELL A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP FROM HIS WARRIORS AND THEY TURNED AND FLED
I WILL BE PUTTING THE CATTLE INTO THE SHIP AND WILL HAVE ALL READY SO INGOLF AND HIS MEN WENT INTO THE FORESTS A LITTLE WAY
SO WHEN KING AUDBIORN AND KING ARNVID SENT OUT THEIR WAR ARROWS A GREAT HOST GATHERED
OLD SIGHVAT LIFTED A HUGE STONE AND CARRIED IT TO THE SHIP'S SIDE
MY FATHER THOUGHT IT BETTER TO DIE IN BATTLE THAN TO BE ANY MAN'S THRALL
GOLD HELMETS SILVER-TRIMMED DRINKING-HORNS EMBROIDERED ROBES AND SWORDS FLASHED OUT
I SAILED THIS SUMMER FROM ICELAND WITH FORTY MEN AND A SHIPLOAD OF GOODS
BEHIND THE ROCKY POINT WAS A LEVEL GREEN PLACE WITH ICE-MOUNTAINS SHINING FAR BACK
I WANT TO HEAR A SONG ABOUT IT AFTER IT IS OVER THIS AUDUN WAS THE SKALD WHO SANG AT THE DRINKING OF KING HALFDAN'S FUNERAL ALE
MEN RAN AFTER US SHOUTING BUT OUR LEGS WERE AS GOOD AS THEIRS
HARALD GROWS MIGHTIER EVERY DAY
WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY PUT IN FOUR HEAD OF CATTLE
TAKE DOWN THE GAY TAPESTRIES THAT HANG IN THE FEAST HALL HE SAID TO THE THRALLS
ALL THE OTHERS TOOK THEIR PLACES AT THE BENCHES
IF YOU SPEAK THESE NAMES QUICKLY THEY SOUND LIKE HAKI ERICSSON AND HAKI HALFDANSSON
HARALD SAT ON THE STEPS BEFORE IT
WHO ARE THESE STRANGERS HE ASKED
SO THE THRALLS SERVED FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
KING HARALD AND ERIC STEPPED UPON THE PLATFORM WHERE THE CROSS-BENCH WAS
PERHAPS THESE WILD MEN HAVE GONE AWAY TO GET MORE PEOPLE AND WILL COME BACK AND KILL US
THEY HAD A FEW DISHES OF SILVER
KING HAVARD SHAKES HIS FIST
I AM HUNGRY TO SEE THE WORLD
THORSTEIN CAME IN WHILE HE WAS WORKING
AS THEY SAILED AWAY EVERYONE LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE OF OLD NORWAY
THE KING LOOKED AT IT CAREFULLY
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE WOMEN'S EYES
AS I HELD IT IN MY FINGERS IT GREW INTO A TALL TREE
AN OLD MAN HARALD'S UNCLE SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT ON THE NORTH SIDE
NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF
I MUST SAIL TO THESE WESTERN ISLANDS AND WHIP THESE ROBBERS IN THEIR OWN HOMES SO HE WENT WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF SHIPS
HOW LONG HER PURPLE TRAILING TAIL
IMMEDIATELY FOUR MEN STEPPED TO MY SIDE
FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THAT PLACE
ROLF CALLED HIS COUNTRY NORMANDY FOR OLD NORWAY
PEOPLE OF THAT COUNTRY STILL READ AN OLD STORY THAT THE MEN OF THAT LONG AGO TIME WROTE ABOUT INGOLF AND THEY LOVE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A BRAVE MAN AND THE FIRST OF MEN TO COME TO ICELAND DECORATION FOOTNOTES
THEY SAW KING HAKI POINT AND SAW TWENTY MEN RIDE OFF AS HE POINTED
WE DO NOT NEED A SLEEPING-HOUSE FOR GUESTS HE SAID
HE WAS A LITTLE MAN WITH A HIGH FOREHEAD AND A SHORT NOSE
WHEN HE BROUGHT IT UP HIS SLEEVE WAS DRIPPING AND THE SWEET MEAD WAS RUNNING OVER FROM THE HORN
I HAVE MY EYE ON ONE UP THE COAST A WAY IN KING HALFDAN'S COUNTRY SO WE SET OFF FOR IT
WE SHOULD BEST NOT TALK TO HIM SO THEY MADE READY THE BOAT IN SILENCE
GAY SHIPS SAILED THE WATERS TAKING ICELAND CLOTH AND WOOL AND ICELAND FISH AND OIL AND THE SOFT FEATHERS OF ICELAND BIRDS TO NORWAY TO SELL AND BRINGING BACK WOOD AND FLOUR AND GRAIN
THEY SLEPT THERE THAT NIGHT
I REMEMBER MY PROMISE
IVAR TAUGHT HIM TO PLAY THE HARP AND TO MAKE UP SONGS
THE LANDSCAPE OF NORWAY ICELAND AND GREENLAND IS WONDERFUL AND WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN GIVING REALITY AND DEFINITENESS TO THE STORIES
YOU ARE MERRY COMRADES ERIC SAID
ENGLAND AND IRELAND AND SCOTLAND ARE OLD
BUT THEY LEFT AN OPEN SPACE TOWARD KING HARALD'S ARMY AND ONE TOWARD KING HAKI'S
WITH UPPER TILDE +X
BUT WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR SCABBARDS WE CAN DO OTHER THINGS EVEN PLAY WITH BABIES I WONDER WHETHER I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO SWING MY SWORD IN THIS QUIET LAND ANOTHER MAN SAID
A GENEROUS OFFER SAID THORFINN
HE WAS MUCH WITH HIS TOOTH THRALL FOR THE KING HAD SAID TO OLAF
BUT THEY ARE PRECIOUS
I CAN DRIVE THEM BACK
HE HAD A LITTLE BRONZE CHEST FILLED WITH THE EARTH THAT WAS UNDER THE ALTAR
FOR HE LOVES YOU HUNTED LIKE A WOLF FROM CORNER TO CORNER OF THE WORLD ERIC CRIED ANGRILY
THE MEN SAT DOWN TO ROW BUT THE TUMBLING WAVES TOSSED THE BOAT ABOUT AND POURED OVER HER AND BROKE THREE OF THE OARS
BUT DO NOT FEAR
AND BEFORE THE DOORS OF VALHALLA IS A GREAT MEADOW WHERE THE WARRIORS FIGHT EVERY DAY AND GET GLORIOUS AND SWEET WOUNDS AND GIVE MANY
HE PASSED ICELAND AND THE FAROES AND THE SHETLANDS
NOW THOR AND OUR GOOD SWORDS HELP US
IT IS AS WONDERFUL AS LEIF'S STORIES
ICELAND BUT AN OLD MAN STOOD UP
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE
SMOKE CURLED ALONG THE HIGH BEAMS IN THE CEILING
LEIF RAN TO HIM AND PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HIM WITH GLADNESS AT SEEING HIM
WE SWAM OUT TO HER AND CLIMBED ABOARD
BUT SOME WENT TO KING HARALD AND SAID
HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SCOWLED
YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
ILLUSTRATION THE SEA FIGHT MANY MEN FELT AS SOLFI DID
THEY LOOK LIKE TRADING SHIPS ERIC SAID
HIS SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF HAD GROWN UP TO BE BIG STRONG MEN
NOW THE VIKINGS SAILED TO THESE ISLANDS AND WERE PLEASED
THERE ARE MANY LITTLE ISLANDS ABOUT NORWAY
AND SHE IS PROUD OF ALL THIS NOW WHEN KING HARALD HEARD THAT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
HE WILL NOT LET ME FIND HIS POSTS HE STRODE OUT OF THE HOUSE AND STOOD SCOWLING AT THE GRAY SEA
IN THAT CASE HE FOUND ESKIMOS THERE
WHEN THE MEAD HORNS WERE GOING AROUND KING HARALD STOOD UP AND SPOKE
I CAN GO THERE WHEN I AM VERY LONELY I WISH THAT I MIGHT SOMETIME BE INVITED TO A FEAST
YOU HAVE ONLY TO OPEN THE DOORS OF YOUR OWN STOREHOUSES
MAY GOOD LUCK GO WITH YOU BY THE BEARD OF ODIN I CRIED
HIS HAMMER NEVER MISSES ITS AIM AND IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO HIS HAND AND IS EAGER TO GO AGAIN WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL THEY LOOKED BACK
PEOPLE FLED BEFORE THEM SOME TO THEIR OWN KINGS SOME INLAND TO THE DEEP WOODS AND HID THERE
THEN HARALD'S MEN THREW A GREAT HOOK INTO THAT BOAT AND PULLED IT ALONGSIDE AND STILL PUSHED KING ARNVID'S PEOPLE BACK
THE PEOPLE ON SHORE HEARD THEM SHOUT
THEY WILL BE BETTER SO
SO ON THE NEXT DAY THEY BEGAN TO MAKE READY A BOAT
KING HARALD OPENED IT AND TOOK OUT RICH GIFTS--CAPES AND SWORD-BELTS AND BEAUTIFUL CLOTH AND BRACELETS AND GOLD CLOAK-PINS
HERE IS A NECKLACE THAT I BEG YOU TO TAKE
IT ALL SEEMED LIKE A FAIRY TALE
I WILL MARRY THE KING OF ALL NORWAY SO WHEN THE WEDDING TIME CAME HARALD RODE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO THE HOME OF GYDA'S FATHER ERIC
HAVE WE NOT SEEN EVERYTHING HERE
I AM TIRED OF THE OLD THINGS
NOW IT IS GOOD TO BE IN VALHALLA
THAT SPRING HE PLANTED WHEAT BUT IT DID NOT GROW WELL
BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY
I SHOULD LIKE TO STAY THERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO THEY SAILED IN AND DREW THEIR SHIPS UP ON SHORE
GUDRID MEANS GUNNR'S RIDER
A BAND OF GOLD HELD DOWN HIS LONG YELLOW HAIR
AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FIGHT FOR A LONG TIME
BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER ERIC ALL AT ONCE LAUGHED LOUDLY AND CALLED OUT
WE CAN LEAVE NO ONE HERE ERIC HAD SAID
MAY ODIN SEND ME SUCH GUESTS EVERY WINTER HE SAID
THERE WAS A GASH IN HIS SHOULDER WHERE A SPEAR HAD CUT
IT IS AT THE SAME TIME LIKE NIFLHEIM AND LIKE ASGARD
THIS MADE THE STORIES ALL THE MORE INTERESTING
MAY YOU DRINK HEART'S-EASE FROM IT FOR MANY YEARS
THERE THEY SAW LEIF AND THE MEN WHO WERE HIS FRIENDS DEAD
AM I NOT A KING'S SON AS WELL AS HE
SO INGOLF AND HIS PEOPLE SAILED ON FOR HOURS AND AT LAST CAME INTO A HARBOR
LEIF TOLD HIM IN WHAT DIRECTION HE HAD SAILED TO COME HOME AND HOW THE SHORES LOOKED THAT HE HAD PASSED
THEN HE WALKED UP TO INGOLF AND SAID
A SAIL
BEFORE THEM WAS A STONE ALTAR
THAT IS THE HANDLE FOR FOES'-FEAR HE SAID
PARKER SCHOOL CHICAGO ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATED BY VICTOR R
BUT AT LAST THERE WERE THE SHETLANDS
ITS NAME IS VALHALLA
BUT FIRST HE MUST DRINK HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL ALE
THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THOR OR ODIN
LEIF STOOD IN THE PROW LEANING FORWARD AND LOOKING FAR AHEAD AND HE SANG
BUT BETTER THEY MAY APPLY NORSE IDEAS OF FORM AND DECORATION AND NORSE PROCESSES IN MAKING SOME MODERN THING THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE
THEN HE SAW THE TORN SLEEVE AND THE RED WOUND BENEATH
ERIC IS A BLOODY MAN
IT IS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT WE ARE ALONE HERE IN THIS GREAT LAND ALL THAT WINTER NO SNOW FELL
PEOPLE CALLED SUCH MEN SKALDS AND THEY CALLED THEIR SONGS SAGAS EVERY MIDSUMMER THERE WAS A GREAT MEETING
WHEN THE STRANGERS SAW IT THEY QUICKLY HELD OUT MORE FURS AND SEEMED EAGER TO TRADE
THEY WORE LEATHER CLOTHES
COMRADES HE SAID WHAT SHALL WE DO
TAKE THIS AS THANKS FOR YOUR GOOD SONG THE GUESTS STAYED THE NEXT DAY AND AT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER FEAST
WE CAN BE OUT IN THE AIR SO MUCH IN THIS WARM COUNTRY SAID GUDRID THAT WE DO NOT NEED FINE HOUSES THE HUTS WERE SCATTERED ALL ABOUT SOME ON THE SIDE OF THE LAKE SOME AT THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR SOME ON THE HILLSIDE
IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH SIDE ROSE THE HIGH SEAT A GREAT CARVED CHAIR ON A PLATFORM
WHO WOULD BE OUR GUESTS HE ROOFED ALL HIS BUILDINGS WITH TURF
FAR OFF WERE THE MOUNTAINS
FREQUENT DRAWN OR PAINTED ILLUSTRATION BY THE CHILDREN OF COSTUMES LANDSCAPES HOUSES FEAST HALLS AND SHIPS WILL HELP TO MAKE THESE IMAGES CLEAR
LEIF SAILED FOR MONTHS
BESIDES I WILL COME TO YOU WITH A SHIP FULL OF GOLD AND CLOTHES AND HOUSE-HANGINGS SUCH AS WE CANNOT GET HERE AND THEY WILL COST ME NOTHING BUT THE SWING OF A SWORD AS THEY TALKED INGOLF LOOKED UP AT THE SKY
AND GOOD IT SEEMED TO BE NEAR A FIRE AND IN A QUIET BED AND BEFORE A STEAMING PLATTER
BUT THEY STOOD UP HIGH ALMOST TO THE ROOF
THE MASTER IS BIARNI
WE LEFT OUR WAVERUNNER IN THE WATER WITH THREE MEN TO GUARD HER
MEN OF THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD STOOD TOGETHER AND THEIR CHIEF LED THEM
THE SEA IS FULL OF FISH THE GREENLANDERS LISTENED WITH OPEN MOUTHS TO ALL THIS
WE WERE WET WITH STORM LEAN WITH HUNGER AND ILLNESS AND HEARTSICK AT OUR BAD LUCK AND YET THORFINN SAID ANOTHER TIME WE MIGHT HAVE BETTER WEATHER
THE OX IS DEAD
THEY MET MANY OF THESE ICEBERGS
ALL AT ONCE THE KING BROKE INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER
THE GUESTS WONDERED AT THE RICHNESS OF HIS GIFTS
HIS FACE FLUSHED RED
TO-DAY I WILL SACRIFICE TO THOR AND ODIN INGOLF SAID
A SHUT MOUTH IS A GOOD FRIEND SO THE TWO SHIPS SAILED ON AND THE MEN WERE GLAD TO HAVE HEARD A GREETING AND TO HAVE CALLED ONE
NOW I SOAR AS HE LEAPED OVER A FROZEN RIVER
KING HAKI FELL DEAD UNDER FOES'-FEAR SO THEY WENT OVER ALL THE BATTLE-FIELD
CARRY OUT THE TABLES SO THEY DID AND BROUGHT IN TWO GREAT TUBS OF MEAD AND SET ONE AT EACH END OF THE HALL
NO SAID ANOTHER
YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR VOW
BATTLES ARE STILL
HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK
WE VIKINGS ARE GREAT FOLK
APPLETON CO NEW YORK ICELAND
WHEN HE FEASTS WITH THOSE HEROES AT NIGHT HE MUST WEAR RICH CLOTHES SO THAT THOSE FEASTERS SHALL KNOW THAT HE WAS A WEALTHY MAN AND GENEROUS AND THAT HIS FRIENDS LOVED HIM INGOLF'S SON TIED ON HIS HELL-SHOES FOR THE LONG JOURNEY
I WILL NOT HAVE HIS EARL SITTING OVER ME
THEN THE EARL CUT HIS HAIR AND BEARD AND COMBED THEM AND PUT A GOLD BAND ABOUT HIS HEAD
IT IS A SICKENING SMELL THORHILD SAID
THE LAND STRETCHES FAR NORTH
SEE WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT HOME THE GREENLANDERS LOOKED
THERE ARE NO MEN THERE
A MAN DARE NOT SWING A SWORD NOW EXCEPT FOR THE KING
HE HIMSELF CARVED THE BEAMS AND THE DOOR-POSTS
THE ISLAND WAS LIKE A MOUNTAIN OF ROCK STANDING OUT OF THE WATER
AFTER THAT WAS DONE KING HARALD SAID
I THANK YOU SO THE NEXT DAY THEY LOADED EVERYTHING ABOARD THE TWO SHIPS AND SAILED FOR LEIF'S HOUSE
SURELY LUCK HAS BROUGHT US ALSO TO A NEW COUNTRY
BUT THE HIGH SEAT ON THE SOUTH SIDE WAS EMPTY
HE CARRIED A ROUND SHIELD ON HIS LEFT ARM
YONDER IS SOME MAN OF MARK HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED
BY THE HAMMER OF THOR HE CRIED THAT IS A GOOD MESSAGE
IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE
THEY CARRIED NO TENTS THEY HAD NO PROVISION WAGONS
ON THE BACK OF HARALD'S HORSE WAS A RED CLOTH TRIMMED WITH THE FUR OF ERMINE
SHOW HIM TO ME HE SHOUTED AND THERE WAS JOY IN HIS VOICE
SO THEY DID AND LIVED THERE THAT SUMMER AND PASTURED THEIR CATTLE AND CUT HAY FOR THE WINTER AND FISHED AND HUNTED
WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THE KING SAID
THERE ARE SOME OF US WHO WILL FOLLOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO ERIC CALLED A MAN FROM ACROSS THE FIRE
WHAT WAS THERE TO TALK ABOUT
WE MUST START BACK
WITH LOWER DIAERESIS ~X
SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING
AS THEY LOOKED THEY TALKED TOGETHER
THORBIORN SPENT ON IT ALL THE WEALTH THAT HE HAD LEFT
SO THAT WINTER GUDRID AND THORFINN WERE MARRIED AND LIVED AT ERIC'S HOUSE
AT LAST THEY FOUND A PLACE THAT ERIC LIKED
AND MANY MEN VOWED TO GO
HERE THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE TO SLEEP
IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ARE GOLDEN CUPS FROM ROME AWAY ON THE SOUTHERN SEA
I WISH THAT I MIGHT SOMETIMES HEAR THE GOOD CLANGING MUSIC OF WEAPONS AT PLAY
THEN THE NORSEMEN PUT TO SEA AGAIN AND SAILED FOR A LONG TIME
SO WE SHALL SLEEP TO-NIGHT IN THE WOODS ABOUT EYJOLF'S HOUSE COMRADES INSTEAD OF IN THESE GOOD BEDS
WALTER SCOTT LONDON THE YOUNGER EDDA ANDERSON
IT IS A LAND OF ICE THEY SAID
I WISH THAT I MIGHT SOMETIME SEE SAILS IN THAT HARBOR
TO THINK OF THE COLD FROZEN WINTERS IN GREENLAND GUDRID SAID
MANY NIGHTS HE DREAMED THAT HE HIMSELF WALKED INTO VALHALLA AND THAT ALL THE HEROES STOOD UP AND SHOUTED
A LITTLE CITY HAS GROWN UP THERE THE ONLY CITY IN ICELAND
WHAT ELSE CAN THRALLS EXPECT HE SAID
AS THEY WORKED ONE MAN WAS WASHED OVERBOARD AND DROWNED
THERE IS A LITTLE KING HERE AND A LITTLE KING THERE--HUNDREDS OF THEM SCATTERED ABOUT
THE PEOPLE CRIED OUT TO THE EARLS FOR HELP
MOST MEN HAD THEM,--ERIC THE RED LEIF THE LUCKY HARALD HAIRFAIR ROLF GO-AFOOT
IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID
HE IS NO BETTER THAN I AM
FOR WE SAW HIS SHIPS LAST NIGHT
ALL THE TIME MEN WERE CALLING ACROSS THE FIRE TO ONE ANOTHER ASKING NEWS OR TELLING JOKES AND LAUGHING
THE HORN BLEW AND QUICKLY EVERY MAN SPRANG TO HIS PLACE IN BOW AND STERN
NAMES AN OLD NORSE STORY SAYS
A STRONG RIVER IS RUNNING HERE
INGOLF SET HIS MEN TO CUTTING DOWN PINES IN THE FOREST AND SOME TO BUILDING A NEW SHIP
THEY SAILED AROUND IT BUT FOUND NO PLACE TO CLIMB UP
OH YES SHE CRIED
YOU CAN PUT YOUR GOODS INTO MY STOREHOUSES BY MY SWORD
HIGH UP UNDER THE EAVES OR IN THE ROOF ITSELF WERE NARROW SLITS THAT WERE CALLED WIND'S-EYES
BID THEM COME IN THREE MONTHS TIME TO DRINK MY FATHER'S FUNERAL ALE HE SAID
WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN
THIS HILL STOOD UP AGAINST THE SKY AND SEEMED TO SAY
THE PILLARS DRIFTED AWAY AND INGOLF COULD NOT SEE THEM
THE SEA FOR A LONG WAY OUT FROM SHORE FROZE SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHITE LAND
WE WENT TO IT AND I STRUCK IT WITH MY SPEAR
THE FARMER CROUCHED BY THE FIRE AFRAID TO MOVE
EVERYTHING COMES TO KING HARALD HIS MEN SAID
WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER
FROM THIS DAY HARALD HALFDANSON I AM YOUR MAN
IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD GO
HERE ARE THE PILES FOR THE CHIEFS AND THESE THINGS GO TO THE OTHER MEN OF THE ARMY SO EVERY MAN WENT AWAY FROM THAT BATTLE RICHER THAN HE WAS BEFORE AND THOR LOOKED DOWN FROM VALHALLA UPON HIS FULL TEMPLE AND WAS PLEASED
SOME MEN WENT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT FROLIC TO GO TO A NEW COUNTRY
IT IS BETTER TO SAVE THE LAND FOR HAY
THIRTY AGAINST TWO HUNDRED
WHEN I HAVE SEEN THESE THINGS I HAVE CURSED THE COUNTRY AND HAVE SAID
EVERY DAY SOME MEN ROWED OUT TO SEA AND FISHED
I THANK YOU GYDA
I LIKE THE PLACE INGOLF SAID
THE GROWN PEOPLE WERE ON A LONG NARROW BENCH THAT THEY HAD PULLED UP TO THE LIGHT AND WARMTH
THEY KILLED HUNTING-DOGS AND PUT THEM BY THE HORSES
TELL ME OF A FIGHT OLAF
ONE WAS HAKI ERIC'S SON
MY EYES ARE HUNGRY FOR THE SIGHT OF MEN AND GREEN FIELDS AGAIN
IN A WINK HE HAD IT OUT AND WAS STRIKING WITH IT
HARALD HALFDANSON AH
THE TABLES WERE STANDING READY BEFORE THE BENCHES
WE WERE AFRAID YOU HAD DIED THEY SAID
THERE IS NO KING BUT YOU IN ALL NORWAY THEN I THINK I WILL CUT MY HAIR THE KING LAUGHED
I ALSO GIVE TO HIM THIS THRALL OLAF
HARALD'S OWN WARRIORS CHEERED SEEING HIM
INSIDE AND OUT THE BOAT BLAZES WITH GOLD AND BRONZE AND HIGH OVER HIS RICHES LIES THE GREAT INGOLF READY TO TAKE THE TILLER AND GUIDE TO VALHALLA WHERE ALL THE HEROES WILL RISE UP AND SHOUT HIM WELCOME THEN THE THRALLS HEAPED A MOUND OF EARTH OVER THE SHIP
OR ELSE WE CAN FIGHT
THIS NORWAY HAS BECOME A PRISON
WHAT IS THIS HE CRIED
IT ALWAYS CHEERS A MAN'S HEART ILLUSTRATION
YOU SHALL PUNISH ANY MAN WHO STEALS OR MURDERS OR DOES ANY WICKED THING
ANYWHERE BEHIND ERIC BUT IT IS NOT TO NIFLHEIM ERIC LAUGHED
MY LORD SHE SAID A LITTLE SON IS JUST BORN TO YOU HA CRIED THE KING AND HE JUMPED UP FROM THE HIGH SEAT AND HASTENED FORWARD UNTIL HE STOOD BEFORE THE WOMAN
BUT AT LAST ERIC FELT THE CURRENT LESS STRONG UNDER HIS HAND
I THINK THAT GIANTS OF FIRE AND GIANTS OF FROST MADE THIS ISLAND
AH LEIF
MANY MEN ARE TALKING OF ICELAND
THE HORRIBLE YELLING AND THE STRANGE THINGS THAT THE SAVAGES DID FRIGHTENED THE NORSEMEN
HAVE I KEPT MY VOW HIS FRIENDS ANSWERED
A LITTLE LAKE GLISTENED BACK FROM SHORE
THEY WERE BLOWN SOUTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS
A SAIL IN THE HARBOR ALL THOSE MEN GAVE A SHOUT WITH NO WORD IN IT AS THOUGH THEIR HEARTS HAD LEAPED INTO THEIR THROATS
THAT YARD WAS A BUSY AND PLEASANT PLACE WITH MEN AND WOMEN RUNNING ACROSS FROM ONE BRIGHT BUILDING TO ANOTHER
STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA
THEY THREW THEIR STONES WITH SLING-SHOTS AND THEY YELLED ALL THE TIME
I WILL TAKE ONLY ONE MAN FOR EVERY OAR AND LEIF AND I WILL STEER SO THEY STARTED OFF
GUNNBIORN SAID ONLY THAT HE SAILED EAST WHEN HE CAME HOME TO ICELAND
WELL WE HAVE DONE IT BEFORE AND IT IS NO BAD PLACE CRIED SOME OF THE MEN
YOUR FIRST WOUND OH IT IS ONLY A WOLF-SCRATCH HARALD ANSWERED
THEN THEY SAW LAND AND LEIF SAID
TO ONE HE GAVE AN ARROW SAYING
I WILL OFF TO IRELAND AND HAVE A FROLIC
HE DROVE IT INTO THE WOLF'S NECK AND THREW HIM BACK ON THE SNOW DEAD
I AM HERE IN THE LAND OF THE GODS THE LAND OF MIGHTY MEN FOR A WHILE HE WALKED THE LAND AS THOUGH HE WERE IN A DREAM
MEN SHALL REMEMBER MY LAST FEAST AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND
THEY STARTED OUT OF THE HOUSE IN ANGER
YOU HAVE KEPT ME WAITING THREE YEARS THOR
THEY TURNED AND TALKED TO LEIF'S SHIP-COMRADES WHO WERE SCATTERED AMONG THEM
AS THEY LOOKED HE TOLD OF DOINGS IN ICELAND AND ASKED OF GREENLAND
A RAGGED WALL OF ROCK REACHED DOWN AND TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW WAS THE BLACK WATER OF THE FIORD
THERE WERE RED AND GOLD DRAGONS WITH LONG NECKS AND CURVED TAILS
THEY LOOKED LIKE GIANTS BATH-TUBS
IN THE HIGH SEAT SITS ODIN A GOLDEN HELMET ON HIS HEAD A SPEAR IN HIS HAND
THEY MUST COME READY FOR WAR AND MOUNTED ON HORSES
WILL HE BE THE FATHER OF A GREAT COUNTRY AS INGOLF WAS BIARNI MUSED
THEY ARE CALLED THE ORKNEYS AND THE SHETLANDS
THEN HE LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID
A DEED TO WIN VALHALLA HE CRIED
IT HAS FIVE HUNDRED DOORS
I LONG TO SEE WHAT IS BACK OF THAT MOUNTAIN SO THEY ALL CLIMBED IT
SHIPS LAY SCATTERED ABOUT TWO BY TWO FIGHTING
YOU MUST DRINK IT AT ONE DRAUGHT PERHAPS ANOTHER SAID
THEN THEY TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES SAYING
SOME OF ERIC'S MEN ALSO GOT READY A BOAT SO THAT THREE SHIPS SET SAIL FROM ERIC'S HARBOR CARRYING ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MEN TO WINELAND
IN THE STERN OF EACH BOAT WAS A LITTLE CABIN
P
P
OR YOU WILL THINK IT THOR WHO CALLS AND I STRUCK MY SHIELD AGAINST THE DOOR SO THAT IT MADE A GREAT CLANGING
YOU MUST SEE THE BEST OF THE FIGHT
VOYAGE EN ISLANDE ET AU GREENLAND BY J
MANY OTHER WARRIORS CHOSE THE SAME DEATH ON THAT TERRIBLE DAY
WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES AND YOUR COUNTRY THEN A FINE BIG MAN WALKED OUT FROM AMONG THE MEN AND WENT UP TO ERIC
THESE COULD BE COPIED UPON THE BLACKBOARD
IT GIVES THE GENERAL SETTING THAT CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IN COSTUME HOUSES IDEALS HABITS
LET US HAVE SOME OF THE OLD GAMES THAT WE USED TO PLAY AT HOME
THEN INGOLF TURNED TO HELGA
WE ARE NOT SO FAR THAT THE GODS WILL FORGET US
WE WILL MAKE THAT SHOCKHEAD SMART HE SAID
HE COMES LIKE A MAD WOLF KING ARNVID'S MEN SAID AND THEY TURNED AND RAN BACK BELOW THE DECK
HIS EYES WERE BIG AND ROLLING
HOT WORK IS AHEAD OF US SAID HAKON
I WOULD GIVE MY RIGHT HAND TO SEE A DRAGON PAWING THE WATER OFF THERE AND TO FLING A WORD TO ITS MEN SIGHVAT SAID
THERE IS LITTLE ROOM TO SPARE AND LITTLE FOOD AND DRINK
FOR HE WAS HANDSOME AND WISE
IT IS LIKE ASGARD THE SHINING INGOLF SAID
I VOW THAT I WILL BUILD MY HOUSE WHEREVER THESE PILLARS LEAD ME HE PUT HIS HAND UPON A TALL POST THAT STOOD BESIDE THE HIGH SEAT
WE WILL TRY IT I ANSWERED IN A WHISPER
THERE WAS A DENT IN HIS HELMET WHERE A GREAT STONE HAD STRUCK
HARALD PUT IT UPON GYDA'S LAP SAYING
HE WAS CAREFUL ALWAYS TO HAVE HAY SO HIS CATTLE PROSPERED
HE THREW AROUND HIMSELF A CAPE OF SCARLET VELVET LINED WITH SEAL FUR
I LONG TO GO THERE AND MEET THE GREAT MEN AND SEE THE PLACES THAT SKALDS SING ABOUT ERIC ANSWERED
THEY ATE OF THEM
I ENVY THE WOMEN OF ICELAND THEIR FAIR CLOTHES THERE IS NO NEED OF THAT THORFINN SAID FOR THIS DRESS IS YOURS AND ANYTHING ELSE FROM MY CHESTS THAT YOU LIKE
KING HARALD'S MEN CHASED THEM FAR BUT DURING THE NIGHT CAME BACK TO CAMP

THE KING HAD MADE THAT SHIELD HIMSELF
HE RAISED IT AND LOOKED UP AT THE SKY AND SAID
WHAT A SHAME FOR SO BRAVE A MAN TO FALL BY THE HANDS OF THRALLS
THEY HAVE MANY GOOD HARBORS FOR SHIPS
HE BORE HARD ON THE RUDDER BUT HE COULD NOT TURN THE SHIP
IT IS FOUR MONTHS SINCE WE LEFT NORWAY INGOLF SAID
OUR TABLES BENT WITH GOOD THINGS TO EAT
GUNNBIORN MEANS GUNNR'S BEAR
HELGA LEIF'S WIFE SANG
ILLUSTRATION HARALD'S BATTLE NOW KING HALFDAN HAD MANY FOES
WHAT NEWS THEN GUTHORM SAID
THEN I PAINTED IT ALL BLACK AND ON THE TIP OF EVERY SCALE I PUT GOLD
I ALWAYS LIKED THE STARS BETTER THAN A SMOKY HOUSE FIRE SAID ONE
ARNVID'S PEOPLE HAD FURLED THEIR SAILS AND WERE TAKING DOWN THE MASTS BUT THE SHIPS WERE STILL DRIFTING ON WITH THE WIND
THERE LAY THE LONG LINE OF KING HARALD'S SHIPS WITH THEIR FIERCE HEADS GRINNING AND MOCKING AT THE NEWCOMERS
SO LEIF LOVED HIM
HE WAS KEEN-EYED AND SOON SAW LEIF IN HIS FAR SEAT
HE WENT MUCH TO THE SMITHY WHERE THE WARRIORS MENDED THEIR HELMETS AND MADE THEIR SPEARS AND SWORDS OF IRON AND BRONZE
ROW TO SHORE AND TAKE US IN THORKEL WAS STANDING BY MY SIDE
INGOLF CARRIED THE BOWL OF BLOOD INTO THE TEMPLE
THEY TASTED OUR SWORDS
AN OLD BOOK THAT TELLS ABOUT HARALD SAYS THAT THEN HE WAS THE BIGGEST OF ALL MEN THE STRONGEST AND THE FAIREST TO LOOK UPON THAT ABOUT A BOY TEN YEARS OLD
HIS HANDS ARE AS RED AS HIS BEARD SOME SAID AND FROWNED
THERE ARE THIRTY OARS IN OUR BOAT
THERE WAS NO LIVING THING ABOUT INGOLF SAID NO WORD BUT HIS FACE WAS WHITE AND HIS MOUTH WAS SET
WE WILL WAIT BUT AN HOUR
SO FOR ALL THAT SUMMER THEY CAMPED IN THAT SPOT AND WENT ABOUT THE COUNTRY SEEING NEW THINGS
MEAD LOVES A MERRY FACE THE WOMEN WERE BEAUTIFUL MOVING ABOUT THE HALL

THEY PUT BASKETS OF BREAD AND WOODEN PLATTERS OF MEAT UPON THESE BARE BOARDS
HARALD THOUGHT OF THE SPEAR-POINT IN HIS BELT
THIS YOUNG KING HAS AN OPEN HAND THEY SAID AND DEEP TREASURE-CHESTS AFTER BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING THE GUESTS WENT OUT AND STOOD BY THEIR HORSES READY TO GO BUT BEFORE THEY MOUNTED THRALLS BROUGHT A HORN OF MEAD TO EACH MAN
AN OLD NORSE STORY TELLS THIS ABOUT THEM
THEY DROVE DOWN STAKES ALL ABOUT A GREAT FIELD
THERE WERE NO KINGS IN ICELAND OR IN GREENLAND
WE WILL MAKE FOR THE SHIPS
DREAMS ARE THE MESSENGERS OF THE GODS
AND THEN HE ASKED OF NORWAY
BUT THERE WAS NO LAUGHING AND NO SHOUTING OF JOKES
THEN I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IT IS THE SWEETEST HOME ON EARTH AS FOR ME I AM COMING HERE TO LIVE
WE WENT TO THEM
ONE DAY A TERRIBLE STORM CAME UP
I WILL NOT STAY HERE GUDRID SAID
SO SOME OF THEM GOT INTO THEIR BOATS AND ROWED ACROSS THE NARROW WATER AND CAME TO GREENLAND AND LIVED THERE
YOU SHALL LIVE AT MY COURT THIS WINTER LEIF ERICSSON
THINGS ARE GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE THE NEWCOMERS SAID
THEY TIED THE HAZEL TWIGS TO THE STAKES IN A STRING
I SHALL HOPE TO DRINK WITH YOU SOMETIME IN VALHALLA THEN ALL MY MEN POURED AROUND THAT FARMER AND CLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER AND PILED THINGS UPON HIM SAYING
WHILE THE THRALLS WERE AT WORK THE MEN STOOD TOGETHER AND TALKED
THE MEN STOOD WITH OPEN MOUTHS AND STARED AFTER HER
IN THE ROOF ABOVE THESE FIRES WERE HOLES FOR THE SMOKE TO GO OUT BUT SOME OF IT BLEW ABOUT THE HALL AND THE WALLS AND RAFTERS WERE STAINED WITH IT
I SEE THE ANSWER FLASHING FROM YOUR EYES HE SAID THAT YOU WILL DO IT EVEN IF IT IS TO GO DOWN TO NIFLHEIM AND DRAG UP HELA THE PALE QUEEN OF THE STIFF DEAD HIS MEN POUNDED ON THE TABLES AND SHOUTED
WELL SAID ERIC I AM GOING TO TRY TO BRING BACK SOME NEIGHBORS FROM ICELAND
ONE DAY THORFINN PUT HIS HAND ON ERIC'S SHOULDER AND SAID
TAKE RICH GIFTS AND GO TO GYDA'S FOSTER-FATHER[8 AND TELL HIM THAT I WILL MARRY GYDA SO GUTHORM AND HIS MEN CAME TO THAT HOUSE AND THEY TOLD THE KING'S MESSAGE TO THE FOSTER-FATHER
IT IS A GOOD LAND BUT WE HAVE LIVED ALONE FOR FOUR YEARS
MANY HAD RAM'S HORNS HANGING FROM THEIR NECKS
FOR THE RAVENS OF ODIN THEY SAID
HERE I WILL BUILD MY HOUSE HE SAID
TELL KING HARALD THAT I WILL NOT MARRY HIM UNLESS HE PUTS ALL OF NORWAY UNDER HIM FOR MY SAKE THE GUESTS SAT SPEECHLESS STARING AT GUTHORM
SHIPS WERE DRIVEN BY THE WIND FROM KNOWN ISLAND TO UNKNOWN
FOR TRADE OR FIGHT LEIF WOULD SHOUT
SOME BIG PIECES HAD BROKEN OFF AND ROLLED DOWN THE HILL
STORY OF MAGELLAN
A HEALTH TO THE FIRST WINELANDER THE MEN SHOUTED AND DRANK DOWN THEIR WINE
HE SAW A SLENDER ASH GROWING ON TOP OF A HIGH ROCK
MAY ALL THE GODS MAKE YOU HAPPY HARALD LED HIS BRIDE TO THE HORSE AND LIFTED HER UP AND SET HER BEHIND HIS SADDLE AND SAID
WE ARE HUNGRY OFF THEY RAN THROUGH A DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE HALL
SHALL WE SAIL UP TO HER AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A CRAFT SHE IS YES SHOUTED HIS MEN
BUT THIS IS AS GOOD A WAY AS ANOTHER SOMETIMES THEY WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE LAND THEN THEY WERE CARRIED OUT INTO THE SEA AND THOUGHT THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER SEE ANY LAND AGAIN
THEIR FACES WERE BROAD
WE CAME HERE TO GET AWAY FROM HIM
LET ME SPEAK AS TO THE PROPER IMAGING OF THE STORIES
SOME WERE STRIPED BLACK AND YELLOW OR BLUE AND GOLD
NOW THERE IS NO FUN IN HAVING GUESTS UNLESS THEY KEEP YOU COMPANY AND MAKE YOU MERRY
THE CHIEF HELD THEM OUT TO THORFINN AND HUGGED THE CLOAK TO HIM HE WANTS TO TRADE THORFINN SAID
HO
WHEN THEY WENT TO THE SHORE TO START OFF AGAIN THE SHETLAND MAN HAD HIS THRALLS CARRY A KEG OF ALE AND A GREAT KETTLE OF COOKED MEAT AND PUT THEM INTO THE SHIP
THE DRAGON RUNS
AND THORFINN SAW RED INDIANS IN WINELAND
BY THE STRONG ARM OF THOR HE CRIED I LIKE THE SOUND OF IT
BUT AFTER MANY HARD FIGHTS ON LAND AND SEA AFTER MANY MEN HAD DIED AND MANY HAD FLED AWAY TO OTHER LANDS KING HARALD WON AND HE MADE THE MEN THAT WERE YET IN THE ISLANDS TAKE THE OATH AND HE LEFT HIS EARLS TO RULE OVER THEM
HE SAYS THAT THORGEST WITH ALL HIS MEN MEANS TO COME HERE AND CATCH YOU TO-NIGHT
SCOTT FORESMAN CO CHICAGO 1876 NORSE STORIES MABIE
WE ARE READY HE SHOUTED
BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR
THEIR BODIES WERE SHORT
WE CAN WORK ON OUR FARMS WITH PEACE NOW
IT WAS A GREAT HALL AND IT WAS FULL OF RICHLY-DRESSED MEN
WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN THEY COULD NOT TALK ENOUGH OF OLD TIMES
I HAD NOT HOPED FOR SUCH GREAT SPORT HERE
HE THREW BACK HIS CAPE AND DREW A LITTLE DAGGER FROM HIS BELT AT LAST THEY CAME TO AEGIR'S ROCK AND WALKED UP ON ITS FLAT TOP
THERE I PUT THE PILOT'S SEAT AND A STRONG TILLER FOR THE RUDDER
IT WAS A WILD COUNTRY THAT THESE TWO WERE WALKING OVER
BUT HE WAS STILL FIGHTING AND LAUGHED AS HE WORKED
THEN SOME SKALD WOULD TAKE HIS HARP AND WALK TO A LARGE STONE OR A KNOLL AND STAND ON IT AND BEGIN A SONG OF SOME BRAVE DEED OF AN OLD NORSE HERO
DRINKING-HORNS THE NORSEMEN HAD FEW CUPS OR GOBLETS
WHEN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR GYDA CAME UP TO THEM AGAIN AND SAID
FOR THERE IS MEAD THERE BETTER THAN MEN CAN BREW AND IT NEVER RUNS OUT
HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM
ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE
OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER WENT HIS SWORD-BELT AND HELD HIS LONG SWORD UNDER HIS LEFT HAND
THERE WAS ONE AT EACH SIDE
AND I WILL GUARD THE OTHER HAKON SAID AND FOUR WENT WITH HIM
THE OX IS DEAD LEIF ASKED THEM ABOUT IT
WE HAVE ALL NOTICED THAT YOU ARE NOT GAY AS YOU USED TO BE
MEN AND ANIMALS FOUGHT ON THE DOOR-POSTS

DECORATION ILLUSTRATION WINELAND THE GOOD ON AN AUTUMN A YEAR OR TWO AFTER LEIF CAME HOME ERIC AND HIS MEN SAW TWO LARGE SHIPS COME TO LAND NOT FAR DOWN THE SHORE FROM THE HOUSE
YES SAID THORFINN WE HAVE COME BACK RICHER THAN WHEN WE LEFT
HIS ANGER IS NO LITTLE THING IT WAS LATE WHEN THEY RODE INTO THE KING'S YARD
COME TO MY HOUSE FOR A FEAST ALL THIS TIME THEY WERE MAKING READY FOR THE VOYAGE REPAIRING THE SHIP AND FILLING IT WITH STORES
THAT MAKES THE THUNDER AND THE LIGHTNING AND CRACKS THE HILLS
NOW I MAKE MY VOW HE RAISED HIS DRINKING-HORN
WE KNEW FROM THE CARVING ON THE DOOR-POSTS THAT THEY WERE LEIF'S
THERE ARE HOUSES AND TEMPLES WOMEN AND WARRIORS AND FEASTS SHIPS AND SONGS AND FIGHTS A CROWDED JOYOUS LAND
THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
HERE IS A SPOT GREEN AND SOFT A SWEET CRADLE FOR MEN
THEY SAID THAT A BEAR HAD COME OUT OF THE WOODS AND KILLED IT AND THAT THEY HAD SCARED THE BEAST AWAY
THE WHITE MAST STANDS AS HIGH AS A HILL IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN
INTO THE SHIP THEY SET A GREAT TREASURE-CHEST FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES AND BRACELETS AND HEAD-BANDS

THEN HE WENT BACK TO NORWAY
TWO HUNDRED SHIPS LAY AT ANCHOR IN THE FIORD LOOKING LIKE STRANGE SWIMMING ANIMALS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH CARVED PROWS AND BRIGHT PAINT
IVAR FALLEN THORSTEIN WOUNDED A DOZEN MEN LYING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT HE LEAPED DOWN FROM THE DECK AND RAN ALONG THE GUNWALE SHOUTING AS HE WENT
I HAVE PLANNED FOR HALF A YEAR
ONE OF THESE CHIEFS WAS SOLFI
AT LAST YULE WAS COMING NEAR
HARALD WENT TO THE EDGE AND LOOKED OVER
HE POINTED TO THE WOODS AND LAUGHED AND ROLLED HIS EYES
BUT AT LAST HE WENT AND SAT ON THE VERY END SEAT OF THE BENCH NEAR HIM
THE FEAST WENT MERRILY UNTIL LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT
NOW THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO
THESE ARE OF COURSE ACCURATE BUT OF LITTLE INTEREST TO CHILDREN
THE FINEST AND LARGEST WAS THE GREAT FEAST HALL
SHE HAD A SHORT APRON OF STRIPED ARABIAN SILK WITH GOLD FRINGE ALONG THE BOTTOM
THESE NICKNAMES WERE OFTEN GIVEN ONLY FOR THE FUN OF IT
WHEN THE DRINKING-HORNS HAD BEEN FILLED AND EMPTIED ERIC PULLED HIMSELF UP AND SMILED AND SHOUTED OUT SO THAT THE GREAT ROOM WAS FULL OF HIS BIG VOICE
ACROSS THE EAST END OF THE HALL WAS A BENCH
THEY STOOD OUT AROUND HIS HEAD IN A GREAT BUSHY MAT OF YELLOW
COME OUT TO AEGIR'S ROCK OLAF AND TELL ME STORIES HE SAID ALMOST EVERY DAY
HE WAS LAUGHING AND TALKING TO HIMSELF
WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
VELLUM WE CALL IT
THERE ARE THE HILLS AND FIELDS THE STREAMS AND ROCKS THAT I LOVE
SO HE SET THE THRALLS TO HELP PULL THE PLOW
WITH UPPER BREVE X
BUT YOU SHALL HAVE MY SPEARS AND MY DRINKING-HORN SAID INGOLF
HE WOULD LIKE YOU TO HAVE THEM IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO LIVE THERE INGOLF SAID
MY NAMING GIFT TO HIM IS TEN POUNDS OF GOLD THEN THE WOMAN CARRIED THE BABY BACK TO THE QUEEN'S ROOM
FOLLOW ME THEY PUT PROVISIONS INTO THE BOAT AND PUSHED OFF AND SAILED UNTIL THEY SAW LEIF'S HOUSES ON THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR
THE STRANGERS SKIN WAS BROWN
WHAT WILL IT BE IN WINTER WE MUST FIND A PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE NOW BEFORE THE WINTER COMES ON SAID ERIC
MANY MEN FOLLOWED HIM
BUT WINTER BEGAN TO COME ON
I SAW THEIR SOUR LOOKS AND WAS AFRAID BUT LEIF ONLY LAUGHED
HUGE SHIPS OF ICE SAILED OUT FROM IT AND MET HIM
THEY ARE LITTLE AND ROCKY AND BARE OF TREES
WORD OF WHAT ERIC MEANT TO DO GOT OUT AND MEN LAUGHED AND SAID
THE MEN CALLED HIM THE WINELAND KING I NEVER KNEW A BABY BEFORE ONE OF THE MEN SAID
EACH WAS GIVEN A NICKNAME
UP WITH THE WAR SHIELD SHOUTED KING HARALD
THEY PAINTED IT FRESHLY AND PUT NEW GOLD ON IT SO THAT IT STOOD THERE A GLITTERING DRAGON WITH HEAD RAISED HIGH LOOKING OVER THE WATER
BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
THEY ARE HOWEVER STRUNG UPON ONE THREAD,--THE WESTWARD EMIGRATION FROM NORWAY
THEY ARE SURELY TWENTY TO OUR ONE BUT WE MUST FIGHT
I WISH TO HEAR THEM THESE TALES WERE NOT WRITTEN
TO-MORROW WE WILL SAIL FOR IRELAND WITH ALL HIS WEALTH TO-MORROW YOU WILL BE FREEZING IN NIFLHEIM CRIED INGOLF AND HE LEAPED AMONG THEM SWINGING HIS SWORD AND ALL HIS MEN FOLLOWED HIM AND THEY KILLED THOSE THRALLS
AT LAST SOME ONE FROM INSIDE SAID
THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
AH FOSTER-BROTHER HE SAID
THERE WAS BLAZING OF FORGES AND CLANGING OF ANVILS ALL THROUGH THE LAND
WE WERE IN A LITTLE FEAST HALL,[4 WITH ITS FIRE DOWN THE MIDDLE OF IT
THERE WAS NO WAY TO STOP THE FLASHING OF HIS BATTLE-AXES BUT TO GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTED

HE SAID TO THE EARLS
IT WAS SUCH A FEAST AS HAD NOT BEEN IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
THERE WE SAW OUR WAVERUNNER WITH SAIL UP AND BOW POINTING TO OPEN SEA
HE DROVE IT INTO THE WOLF'S NECK THEN WITHOUT THINKING OF HIS TORN ARM HE PUT ON HIS SKEES AND WENT LEAPING HOME
THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
THEY WERE WET TO THE SKIN AND WERE COLD AND THEIR ARMS AND LEGS ACHED WITH THE HARD WORK AND THEY WERE HUNGRY FROM THE LONG WAITING BUT NOT ONE FACE WAS WHITE WITH FEAR
ALL ALONG BEHIND THE BENCHES WERE THE BLACK AND GRAY DRAPERIES
WHEN HE SAT IN IT HE COULD LOOK ALL OVER THE WORLD
HE WAS CHUCKLING IN HIS BEARD AND SAID NOTHING TO THEM
INGOLF SOLD HIS HOUSE AND LAND AND EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE WITH HIM
MANY MEN TOOK THE OATH AND BECAME HIS FRIENDS
THE NIGHT THAT IT WAS FINISHED I WENT TO MY FATHER'S FEAST
I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE
IT WAS THE YEAR AFTER LEIF CAME BACK
THESE SHALL BE OUR HOUSES THORFINN SAID
THEN THEY KILLED THE HORSES AND DRAGGED THEM INTO THE SHIP
UNDER THEM HE LAID THE SOIL OF NORWAY THAT HE HAD BROUGHT IN THE LITTLE BRONZE CHEST
THEN A BIG BLOODY VIKING OF KING ARNVID LEAPED UPON THE EDGE OF THE SHIP AND STOOD THERE
ON BOTH SIDES WERE LOW HILLS
OH I AM GLAD THEY ARE GONE THORFINN SAID
WHAT WILL HE NOT DO SOME MEN LIKED THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY CAME TO ERIC AND SAID
BUT AFTER A WHILE SHE TOLD HIM THIS STORY
WILL NOT THE STORIES OF BATTLES OF BRAVE DEEDS OF MIGHTY MEN DO THIS SO AS THE FAMILY WORKED IN THE RED FIRE-LIGHT THE FATHER TOLD OF THE KINGS OF NORWAY OF LONG VOYAGES TO STRANGE LANDS OF GOOD FIGHTS
IS THAT NOT LIKE ERIC
THINK OF ME WHEN YOU EAT THIS HE SAID
IT WILL BE SLOW GOING FOR HAVARD TO-NIGHT ILLUSTRATION
CABLES WERE THROWN ACROSS FROM ONE PROW TO THE NEXT AND ALL THE SHIPS WERE TIED TOGETHER SO THAT THEIR SIDES TOUCHED
THE MAN WORE A LONG LOOSE COAT OF WHITE WOOL BELTED AT THE WAIST WITH A STRAP
WHAT IS GROWING ON THOSE HILLSIDES THORFINN SAID SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND
THEIR HUT WAS A LITTLE MEAN THING OF STONES AND TURF
MANY OF THOSE MEN CARRIED VIKING SCARS ALL THEIR LIVES
A HIGH ROCKY POINT STUCK OUT INTO THE SEA
WHEN YULE WAS OVER THORFINN SAID TO ERIC
PERHAPS IN AFTER DAYS MEN WILL MAKE SONGS ABOUT THOSE FOSTER-BROTHERS INGOLF AND LEIF WHO MADE A NEW COUNTRY IN A WONDERFUL LAND AND WHOSE SONS AND GRANDSONS ARE MIGHTY MEN IN ICELAND INGOLF LEAPED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
THE RICH HANGINGS WERE GONE FROM THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
THE KING'S NAME WAS OLAF
SOME WORE COATS OF MAIL BUT OTHERS WORE ONLY THEIR JACKETS AND TIGHTS OF BRIGHT-COLORED WOOL
WHERE WILL SHE STEER
IT IS A GOOD HIDING PLACE FOR TREASURE SOON INGOLF AND HIS MEN GOT INTO THEIR SHIP AND WERE OFF
YOU ARE THE FIRST TO FEEL THE TOOTH OF FOES'-FEAR HE SAID BUT I THINK YOU WILL NOT BE THE LAST ILLUSTRATION
NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE
THERE IN A CLEARED SPACE STOOD A LARGE BUILDING
BUT AT EACH MAN'S LEFT SIDE HUNG A GREAT SHIELD
ERIC WAITED ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A CLEAR PASSAGE IN THE WATER
IN THE VALLEY WERE HOT SPRINGS WITH STEAM RISING FROM THEM
ON ONE OF THEM WAS A WHITE BEAR
HENRY FROUDE 1890 AMERICA NOT DISCOVERED BY COLUMBUS ANDERSON
BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOP OF A ROUGH HILL THORFINN CRIED
I WISH THAT I MIGHT THINK AROUND THIS POINT OF LAND IS ANOTHER FARM AND ACROSS THE BAY IS ANOTHER
THE WIND IN OUR SAIL THE SEA IN OUR FACE AND THE SMELL OF THE FIGHT
I THINK THAT I SEE ONE OF GUNNBIORN'S SHIPS OF ICE
HER LONG YELLOW HAIR WAS PULLED AROUND AT THE SIDES AND OVER HER BREAST AND WAS FASTENED UNDER THE BELT OF HER APRON
I LIKE THEM BOTH
TWO RAVENS SIT ON ODIN'S SHOULDERS AND WHISPER IN HIS EARS ALL THAT THEY HAVE HEARD AND SEEN
HE DOES NOT NEED THEM NOW
I THOUGHT THAT ALL THIS NIGHT'S WORK WOULD BE MY DEATH OH DO NOT FEAR THAT I LAUGHED FOR A DEAD MAN SETS NO TABLES SO WE DRANK AND ALL GREW MERRIER
COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND MANY MEN SAID THAT THEY WOULD DO IT
I AM AN EAGLE
IT SENDS OUT A COLD BREATH SAID ONE OF THE MEN
THEY WENT TO ALL THE OTHER HUTS AND LOOKED AT EVERYTHING THERE
I LIKE THIS LITTLE TASTE OF YOUR HOSPITALITY FRIEND FARMER
THERE THRALLS WERE BOILING THE HORSEFLESH IN POTS OVER THE FIRE
BESIDES HARALD WILL NOT LONG KEEP HIS HANDS OFF THEM
THE BENCHES ON BOTH SIDES WERE FULL OF MEN
WHERE SWORDS WILL SING WHERE SPEARS WILL BITE WHERE I SHALL LAUGH SO WE HARRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY
THERE IS THE FLASH OF THE ARMOR OF THE VALKYRIAS.[11 A BATTLE IS ON SOMEWHERE AND ODIN HAS SENT HIS MAIDENS TO CHOOSE THE HEROES FOR VALHALLA LEIF ONLY LAUGHED AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
KING OF ALL NORWAY
EVERY LAND POURS RICH THINGS INTO OUR TREASURE-CHEST
THEY USED INSTEAD THE HORNS OF CATTLE POLISHED AND TRIMMED WITH GOLD OR SILVER OR BRONZE
DURING THESE WARS WHENEVER KING HARALD GOT A COUNTRY FOR HIS OWN THIS IS WHAT HE DID
BUT ONCE THEY LIVED FARTHER SOUTH IN PLEASANTER LANDS
7 SEE NOTE ABOUT TABLES ON PAGE 196
THE IDEA IN IT IS TO GIVE IMPORTANCE SEQUENCE REASONABLENESS BROAD CONNECTIONS TO THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
ERIC WAS AT MANY FEASTS AND SAW MANY MEN AND HE TALKED MUCH OF HIS GREENLAND
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I CLIMBED UP AND SAT ON HIS HEAD OLAF HE LAUGHED AND KICKED HIS HEELS AND RAN ON
INGOLF STILL SENT HIS THRALLS OUT TO LOOK FOR THE PILLARS
ESKIMOS NOW THE ESKIMOS LIVE IN GREENLAND AND ALASKA AND ON THE VERY NORTHERN SHORES OF CANADA
TO THE OARS AGAIN HE CALLED
THEY WERE LETTING A BOAT DOWN THE STEEP SIDE WITH ROPES
IN NORWAY THEY LEFT BURNING HOUSES AND WEEPING WOMEN
THEN HE LIFTED THE BABY IN HIS ARMS WHILE THE OLD SERVING-WOMAN BROUGHT A SILVER BOWL OF WATER
IN THE VALLEY WERE HALFDAN'S HOUSES AROUND THEIR SQUARE YARD
HAVE WE NOT SEEN ANGRY WATER BEFORE
HERE I GO TO GET RICHES FOR OUR NEW LAND HE SAID
BUT THE MEN WOULD SLEEP ON THE TIMBERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOAT AND PERHAPS THEY WOULD PUT UP THE AWNING SOMETIMES
EDMONSTON DOUGLAS EDINBURGH VOLSUNGA SAGA MORRIS AND MAGNUSSON
IT IS ALWAYS OTHER PEOPLE WHO KNEEL TO HIM WHEN THE BRIDE HAD TASTED THE FOOD AND TOUCHED THE MEAD-HORN TO HER LIPS SHE STOOD UP AND WALKED FROM THE HALL
PERHAPS THEY WILL HAVE RICH CLOTH AND JEWELRY
KING HARALD'S MEN WAITED ON THE HILLSIDE AND WATCHED THE OTHER ARMY ACROSS THE VALLEY
ILLUSTRATION FOES'-FEAR EVERY DAY THE BOY HARALD HEARD SOME SUCH STORY OF WAR OR OF THE GODS UNTIL HE COULD SEE THOR RIDING AMONG THE STORM-CLOUDS AND THROWING HIS HAMMER UNTIL HE KNEW THAT A BRAVE MAN HAS MANY WOUNDS BUT NEVER A ONE ON HIS BACK
I WILL NOT BE HIS WIFE UNLESS HE PUTS ALL OF NORWAY UNDER HIM FOR MY SAKE SO GUTHORM AND HIS MEN RODE HOMEWARD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
THEY TOO WERE TALL AND STRONG
THE MANY BRANCHES OF THAT TREE ARE THE MANY SONS OF HARALD WHO SHALL BE EARLS AND KINGS IN NORWAY AND THEIR SONS AFTER THEM FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PART II ILLUSTRATION WEST-OVER-SEAS DECORATION ILLUSTRATION HOMES IN ICELAND MEN HAD BEEN FEASTING IN INGOLF'S HOUSE
THEN HIS FATHER SAID
THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND
A PLACE TO BUILD A RED FIRE AND THAW THE BLOOD THAT SEA-WINDS FROZE BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEAR THEY SAW NO PLACE TO LAND
WHEN IT WAS LESS CROWDED ABOUT THE DOORWAY I WHISPERED
THEN THE MEN SET THEIR SAILS AGAIN AND THEY WENT PAST A TONGUE OF LAND INTO A BROAD FIORD
ERIC'S PEOPLE KEPT THEMSELVES WRAPPED IN THEIR CLOAKS AND PUT SCARFS AROUND THEIR HEADS
I HAVE SEEN BOILING WATER SHOOT UP OUT OF THE GROUND
THEY ALL WRAPPED THEIR CLOAKS ABOUT THEM
I AM TIRED OF THE DARKNESS AND THE SMOKE AND THE CATTLE
WHEN SHALL THE WHITE HORSES OF THE SEA LEAD ME OUT TO STRANGE LANDS AND GLORIOUS BATTLES BUT HARALD DID SOMETHING BESIDES LISTEN TO STORIES
WHEN IT FELL ON THE DECK IT POINTED UP-SHORE SO I STEERED IN THAT DIRECTION
THEY ALL STOOD ABOUT IT AND LOOKED AT IT AND FELT OF IT AND TALKED FAST
AFTER THAT WAS OVER HE SAID
IT IS FLYING STRAIGHT TOWARD ICELAND THE MEN SHOUTED WITH JOY AT THAT
THIS IS MY VOW
AS MY NAMING GIFT I GIVE YOU THIS DRINKING-HORN IT IS A GOOD NAME LAUGHED ALL THE MEN
AS STRONG AND AS BRAVE AND AS RED AS THOR
BUT STILL THE MEN HELD ON
HE IS THE FIRST AND LAST WINELANDER FOR NO ONE WILL EVER GO THERE AGAIN
I THINK IT IS THE HOME OF A GIANT
THEY DO NOT ANSWER
THE DOOR OPENED ONLY A LITTLE BUT I PUSHED IT WIDE AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM
THEN THEY THREW THEMSELVES DOWN ON THE GRASS AND ROLLED AND STRETCHED THEIR ARMS AND SHOUTED FOR JOY
IV
YOU KNOW THAT ASGARD IS UP IN THE SKY OLAF SAID
OTHER THRALLS RAN IN WITH LARGE STEAMING KETTLES OF MEAT
I HAVE SEEN GREAT BASINS IN THE ROCKS FILLED WITH WARM WATER
WHAT DO YOU WANT THE STRANGER SAID SOMETHING BUT THE NORSEMEN COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
THEY STOWED THESE THINGS AWAY IN THE ENDS OF THE SHIP
THE GOOD OLD DAYS HAVE GONE
THE BOAT WAS GONE
EVERYBODY'S HANDS WERE BUSY WITH WOOL
OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND
THESE WERE PUT INTO THE WIND'S-EYES IN STORMY WEATHER
LET THIS GIFT SHOW MY LOVE LEIF ERICSSON HE SAID
I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
VALKYRIAS THESE WERE THE MAIDENS OF ODIN
THEN THEY WANTED THE PLEASANT LAND OF THE ESKIMOS AND THE SEASHORE THAT THE ESKIMOS HAD
TWO WELL-BUILT HOUSES STOOD NEAR
HE PUT ON LONG TIGHTS OF BLUE WOOL AND A SHORT JACKET OF BLUE VELVET
HE ALSO GAVE THEM GIFTS
THE MEN SHOUTED AS THEY WENT AND BLEW THEIR RAM'S HORNS
THESE MEN DID NOT FORGET NORWAY
COME AND LOOK AT MY GOODS SO HE ROWED ERIC AND GUDRID OUT AND THEY WENT ABOARD HIS BOAT
THORSTEIN MEANS THOR'S STONE
THERE WAS A LITTLE NAKED BABY
KING HARALD AND HIS PEOPLE RODE A LITTLE WAY WITH THEM
I VOW THAT I WILL FIND THIS ICELAND AND PASS THE WINTER THERE AND THAT IF MAN CAN LIVE UPON IT I WILL GO BACK THERE AND SET UP MY HOME AND I VOW THAT I WILL FOLLOW MY FOSTER-BROTHER CRIED LEIF
I HAVE NO TIME TO DRINK HE SAID
LET US GO TO A NEW PLACE
AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE NIGHT THE FEAST BEGAN
THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID
OUR DRAGON FED AND CRAWLS AWAY WITH BELLY STUFFED AND LAZY FEET
I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID
ONE DAY HE MADE HIMSELF A SPEAR-HEAD
THE PEOPLE GOT INTO THESE BEDS AND CLOSED THE DOORS AND SO SHUT THEMSELVES IN
BUT SUDDENLY WE HEARD A SHOUT OUTSIDE
KING HARALD'S SHIP LAY PROW TO PROW WITH KING ARNVID'S
AT LAST KING HARALD SAID
DIACRITICAL MARKS FOUND IN THE PRONOUNCING INDEX ARE REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS
THE REST OF US WENT INTO THE HOUSE
IN SOME WAY THEY MET MY LORD AND HIS MEN IN THE WOODS AND KILLED THEM
AND SOMETIMES EYJOLF SENT AND SAID
BEFORE KING HARALD CAME SOMETHING WAS ALWAYS WRONG
IT IS LIKE FLYING HE THOUGHT AND LAUGHED
SURELY NO SHIP EVER CARRIED A RICHER LOAD
SHE CARRIED A LITTLE WHITE BUNDLE IN HER ARMS
MY THROAT IS DRY FOR MEAD
FOR A LONG TIME THEY COULD SAY NOTHING BUT WELCOME
AFTER A WHILE HE TOOK THEM TO BIARNI'S SHIP
THESE VIKINGS HAD BROUGHT THEIR OLD COURAGE TO THEIR NEW HOMES
THESE NORSE STORIES HAVE TO MY THINKING THREE VALUES
MANY BROUGHT SWORDS AND HELMETS AND BRACELETS OR SILVER-TRIMMED SADDLES AND BRIDLES WITH THEM
THEY ATE OTHER MEN'S MEALS
WE NEVER SEE SUCH THINGS AS THESE IN THIS BARE LAND GUDRID SAID AS SHE SMOOTHED A BEAUTIFUL DRESS OF PURPLE VELVET
WILL YOU JOIN WITH MY COUSIN ARNVID AND ME AGAINST THIS YOUNG SHOCKHEAD YES I WILL DO IT SAID THE KING
SOME CAME IN BOATS
WITH A LARGE MAP OF NORWAY
NO OTHER WOMAN IN THE WORLD KNOWS SO MUCH ABOUT HERBS AS SHE DOES
ILLUSTRATION GYDA'S SAUCY MESSAGE NOW HARALD HEARD MEN TALK OF GYDA THE DAUGHTER OF KING ERIC
SOMETHING IS TROUBLING YOU ERIC
SOMETIMES IT WAS THORFINN'S LUCK TO SIT BY GUDRID
I WILL NOT BE HIS WIFE UNLESS HE PUTS ALL OF NORWAY UNDER HIM FOR MY SAKE ILLUSTRATION
WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW
HORSES AND CATTLE PASTURED ON THE HILLSIDES
EDMONSTON DOUGLAS EDINBURGH IVAR THE VIKING A ROMANCE DU CHAILLU
WHERE SHALL WE GO A MAN STOOD UP FROM THE BENCH
I HAVE NOT OFTEN INTERRUPTED INCIDENT WITH SPECIAL DESCRIPTION NOT BECAUSE I DO NOT CONSIDER THE GETTING OF VIVID AND DETAILED IMAGES MOST NECESSARY TO FULL ENJOYMENT AND TO PROPER INTELLECTUAL HABITS BUT BECAUSE I TRUSTED TO THE PICTURES OF THIS BOOK AND TO THE TEACHER TO DO WHAT SEEMED TO ME INARTISTIC TO DO IN THE STORY
HE HAD NEVER SEEN A KING
HERE THE VIKINGS HID WHEN THEY SAW KING HARALD'S SHIPS COMING
SKALDS LEARNED SONGS FROM HEARING THEM SUNG
SOON THE KING ROSE AND SAID
WE SHALL NEED THE MILK AND PERHAPS THE MEAT INGOLF SAID
A HEALTH TO KING HARALD AND THEY ALL DRANK IT
SO THEY WENT ON TOWARD IT
NOW HEAR MY VOW
OUR FIVE SWORDS HELD HIM BACK FOR A LONG TIME BUT AT LAST HE PUSHED IN AND HIS MEN POURED AFTER HIM
BUT I WILL NEVER GO AGAIN FOR ALL THE SKINS IN THE WOODS THE NEXT SUMMER THORFINN TOOK GUDRID AND SNORRI AND ALL HIS PEOPLE AND SAILED BACK TO ICELAND HIS HOME
MOST MEN HAD TWO NAMES IN ONE AND THOUGHT IT LIKELIEST TO LEAD TO LONG LIFE AND GOOD LUCK TO HAVE DOUBLE NAMES TO BE CALLED AFTER A GOD WAS VERY LUCKY
I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE LUCK HAS FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY SAID LEIF
OFTEN IT WAS TORN BY WINDS AND A GRAY SKY HUNG OVER IT AND THE MEN WERE DRENCHED WITH RAIN
ON HIS HEAD WAS A GOLD HELMET WITH A DRAGON STANDING UP FROM IT
BUT NOW FOR A HANDLE IT WAS WINTER AND THE SNOW WAS VERY DEEP
AND INGOLF TOOK OTHERS AND THEY SAILED ALONG THE SHORE SEEING WHAT KIND OF A LAND THIS WAS
OTHER NORSEMEN WENT TO IRELAND AND ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND
HE THREW BACK HIS CAPE AND DREW A LITTLE DAGGER FROM HIS BELT
WHAT BATTLES HAVE YOU FOUGHT
IN THE SPRING HE WENT TO A CERTAIN KING AUDBIORN AND SAID TO HIM
SCOUR EVERY DISH UNTIL IT SHINES THEN HARALD SENT MESSENGERS ALL OVER THAT COUNTRY TO HIS KINSMEN AND FRIENDS
BUT PERHAPS WE MUST BE SAILING LONGER THAN THAT
WE ARE LEAVING OUR WOMEN THEN ONE OF THE WOMEN RAN OUT OF THE HUT WHERE THEY WERE HIDING
IT IS VERY STRANGE TO SEE HOT WATER AND SMOKE COME OUT OF THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THIS GREEN LAND WAS A GOOD HARBOR WITH ISLANDS IN IT
IT IS THE NAME OF MY SPEAR-POINT AND IT SAYS FOES'-FEAR HARALD SAID
CHAIN-ARMOR COVERED THE KING'S BODY
IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE BUT EVEN AS HE SAID IT HE FELT HIS BOAT SWING UNDER HIS HAND AS HE HELD THE TILLER
ALL THOSE PEOPLE SAT DOWN AND ATE THE GRAPES AND THEN WENT TO THE HILLSIDE AND PICKED MORE
IT WAS SOME NEW LANGUAGE
LET HIM LIVE
I THOUGHT OF THE SEA FULL OF GOOD FISH
BUT I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO
THE MEN WITH THE CRUDE COURAGE AND THE STRANGE ADVENTURES THAT MAKE A MAN INTERESTING TO CHILDREN HAVE AT THE SAME TIME THE LOVE OF TRUTH THE HARDY ENDURANCE THE FAITHFULNESS TO PLIGHTED WORD THAT MAKE THEM A CHILD'S FIT COMPANIONS
THEN KING HARALD SAID
BE EVER AT HIS CALL NOW THIS OLAF WAS FULL OF STORIES AND HARALD LIKED TO HEAR THEM
HE HAD HIS THRALLS PLANT LARGE CROPS OF GRAIN AND GRIND FLOUR AND MAKE NEW KEGS AND CHESTS OF WOOD
IT WAS LIKE FIGHTING AGAINST AN ARMY OF POISONOUS FLIES THE NORSEMEN WERE ALL WORN AND BLEEDING AND SORE
NO I WILL SERVE MY BRIDE SO HE KNELT AND HELD THE PLATTER
THEN THE QUEEN STOOD UP AND CALLED SOME OF HER WOMEN
SURELY WE MUST STAY HERE FOR A LONG TIME THE VERY NEXT DAY THEY WENT INTO THE WOODS AND BEGAN TO CUT OUT LUMBER
LEIF AND GRIM SHALL BE THE SAME KIND OF FRIENDS TO YOUR TWO SONS I NAMED NINE OTHERS AND SAID
THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
ARE THEY FOES
SOME OF HER YOUNGER WOMEN WORE NO LINEN ON THEIR HEADS AND HAD THEIR WHITE ARMS BARE WITH BRACELETS SHINING ON THEM
IT WAS FASTENED OVER HIS BREAST WITH GREAT GOLD BUCKLES
WHEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR ERIC SAID
CAN THIS YOUNG SHOCKHEAD MAKE COWARDS OF YOU ALL HE CRIED
AS WE WALKED ALONG THE SHORE LOOKING FOR THE PILLARS WE SAW A MAN LYING ON THE SHORE
IT IS A WAR-CRY THORFINN SAID AND HE RAISED A RED SHIELD
THESE STORIES ARE VERY PRECIOUS
I SEE SMOKE RISING FROM HOUSES AND SHIPS STANDING ON THE SHORE AND FRIENDLY HANDS WAVING FOOTNOTES
BUT IT IS A LONG ROAD AND A ROUGH ROAD TO VALHALLA THAT THESE MEN MUST TRAVEL
YONDER IS A STRANGE PILOT ERIC LAUGHED
WALLS WERE HUNG WITH GAY DRAPERIES
AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD NOT CUT HIS HAIR OR COMBED IT
IN THE SPRING ERIC MEANS TO GIVE HIM A FARM UP THE FIORD A WAY
IF HE IS KILLED BEFORE I AM I WILL PUNISH THE MAN WHO DID IT
DO YOU NOT THINK WE SHALL BE MERRY COMPANY WE CAME ONLY TO CHEER YOU SAID ANOTHER
RAND MCNALLY CO CHICAGO 1902 INCIDENTS HARALD
ON ACCOUNT OF THAT HARD RIDE NO WOMEN CAME TO THE FEAST
BUT WHEN HARALD BECAME KING THEY SAID
ANOTHER ROSE IN HIS STIRRUPS AND SNIFFED THE AIR
THE SHIPS FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER AND INGOLF AND LEIF WERE OFF FOR ICELAND
THEY PUT EVERY MAN ON HIS SHIELD AND CARRIED HIM AND LAID HIM ON A HILL-TOP
THE TRUNK WAS THICK AND RED AS BLOOD BUT THE LOWER LIMBS WERE FAIR AND GREEN AND THE HIGHEST ONES WERE WHITE
HE HAD QUICKLY TURNED HIS BOAT AND WAS ROWING BACK
I MEAN TO SAIL TO THAT LAND A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP THAT SHOOK THE RAFTERS
BUT AT LAST HE CAME NEAR NORWAY
BLACKWOOD SONS EDINBURGH 1894 NORTHERN ANTIQUITIES PERCY EDITED BY BLACKWELL
AFTER A WHILE THEY WERE WRITTEN LIKE THAT AND MEN HANDED THEM ON TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS
ERIC WENT ABOUT THE HOUSE GLOOMY THEN
THEN HE LAUNCHED HIS BOAT AND THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD AGAIN
I AM PROUD TO HAVE YOU FOR GUESTS
IT IS SWEETER THAN THOSE STRANGE WATERS OF ARABIA SO THE ARMY WENT MERRILY THROUGH THE LAND
IT IS ODIN'S WILL THAT WE GO HE SAID
THEN THEY SAID
LET US GO TO MEET THEM SO THEY WENT AND STOOD ON THE SHORE
IT WAS RATHER A WEALTHY FARM FOR THERE WERE STABLES AND A STOREHOUSE AND A SMITHY AT THE SIDES OF THE HOUSE
BUT MANY HAD RIDDEN FAR THROUGH MOUNTAINS SWIMMING RIVERS
FOR THEY HAD MADE SOME FROM WINELAND GRAPES
AH HARALD GUTHORM CRIED SURELY THOR IN VALHALLA SMILED WHEN HE HEARD THAT VOW THE MEN SAT ALL NIGHT TALKING OF THAT WONDERFUL VOW
IT WAS DARK IN THE ROOM AND THE PEOPLE OUT OF DOORS COULD NOT TELL HOW MANY WERE INSIDE
TIE THEM FAST FOR THEY WILL NEED THEM MUCH ON THAT HARD ROAD SO FRIENDS TIED SHOES ON THE DEAD MEN'S FEET
THEY LIVED THERE THAT WINTER
HE LEFT BUT A HANDFUL TO GUARD HIS SHIPS
AND YOU THOUGHT OF FROST GIANTS THEN THEY SAILED ON FOR DAYS AND DAYS
THERE IS NO WATER THAT HAS NOT LICKED OUR BOATS SIDES
THEN HE SAW THAT LEIF'S SHIP WAS BEING DRIVEN FAR OFF
ALL THESE THINGS INGOLF WILL NEED IN VALHALLA
I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LAND
AND INDEED I NEVER SAW A LAND THAT I LIKED BETTER
THEIR HAIR WAS BLACK
BOHN LONDON 1859 ALSO THE SAGAS NAMED ON PAGE 206
NOW WE SHALL TASTE SOMETHING BETTER THAN EVEN KING HARALD'S ALE SHOUTED ONE
SO IN THE SPRING THEY ALL WENT BACK TO NORWAY
HE WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT HIS SPEARS AND HIS SHIELD AND SAID TO HIS MEN
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO LIE
EVERY TIME IT HIT A MAN OF ARNVID'S MEN
SOMETIMES THEY PASSED SHIPS AND ALWAYS MADE SURE TO SAIL CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAIL THEM
SURELY IF THERE ARE FISH IN THE SEA AND GRASS IN THE VALLEYS WE CAN LIVE THERE
FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE SAT HERE NEAR THE HIGH SEATS
WHEN THEIR HORSES SHAKE THEIR MANES DEW FALLS ON THE DEEP VALLEYS AND HAIL ON THE HIGH FORESTS ODIN'S RAVENS ODIN HAD A GREAT THRONE IN HIS PALACE IN ASGARD
INGOLF TOOK A LITTLE BRUSH OF TWIGS THAT LAY ON IT AND DIPPED IT INTO THE BLOOD AND SPRINKLED THE STATUES
THE FORESTS ARE WITHOUT END
GUTHORM YOU SHALL TAKE THE SAME MESSAGE TO GYDA THAT YOU GAVE TEN YEARS AGO SO GUTHORM WENT AND BROUGHT BACK THIS ANSWER FROM GYDA
I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN
IT EXPLAINS THE CAUSE OF THE EMIGRATION FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY
I SHOULD LIKE TO STAND ON A HILL AND LOOK AROUND ON A WIDE LAND AND THINK THIS IS ALL OURS AND OUT UPON A ROUGH SEA AND THINK FAR OFF THERE ARE OUR FOES AND THEY DARE NOT COME OVER TO US BESIDES WE SHALL HAVE NO SHOCKHEAD HARALD TO LORD IT OVER US
LET US FIND HOMES THERE THEN LEIF IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE INGOLF STOOD UP
AGAIN HE BLEW HIS HORN
IN THE MORNING GUDRID SAID
THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING
SO HE HAD TWO RAVENS TO HELP HIM
HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY LIMB THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND SMILED AND REMEMBERED HER DREAM AND THOUGHT
I WILL LOVE THIS MAN UNTIL I DIE
MANY MEN WE FOUND OVERBURDENED WITH GOLD
WE ALL STOOD STARING
WE HAVE FOUND THE PILLARS INGOLF JUMPED TO HIS FEET
YOU WOULD MAKE TIMES MERRY IN VALHALLA SO INGOLF PUT HIS SPEARS AND HIS DRINKING-HORN BY LEIF
HARALD JUMPED TO HIS FEET
I ALMOST THINK I NEVER FELT A FIRE BEFORE OR HAD WARM FOOD IN MY MOUTH THE MEN LAUGHED
WHEN THE MEAT CAME THE TALKING STOPPED
THERE WAS AN ISLAND IN THE BAY WHERE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS HAD THEIR NESTS
INGOLF WALKED TO THE HIGH SEAT
EVERY SUMMER KING HARALD HAD OUT HIS SHIPS AND MEN AND HUNTED THESE VIKINGS
THE NORSEMEN'S SWORDS SWUNG FAST AND MANY OF THE STRANGERS DIED UNDER THEM BUT STILL OTHERS CAME ON THROWING STONES AND SWINGING STONE AXES
NORSE CARVED AND PAINTED HOUSES BRIGHTENED THE HILLSIDES
COME AND SPEND NEXT WINTER AT MY HOUSE
OLAF'S DRAGON FLIES
NOTHING GREW ON THEM
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL BAY WITH A SMOOTH GREEN FIELD BY IT AND THE GREAT MOUNTAINS FAR BACK
NOW THE KING WAS GOING TO HOLD A FEAST AT NIGHT AND LEIF PUT ON HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO GO TO IT
HELLO I SHOUTED AND MY MEN MADE A GREAT DIN
AN OLD NORSE STORY SAYS THIS ABOUT THE VALKYRIAS
SOMETIMES DURING THE FIGHT A MAN WOULD THINK THAT HE SAW THE VALKYRIAS
THORSTEIN HE SHOUTED UP WITH THE WHITE SHIELD AND GO TELL KING HAKI TO CHOOSE HIS BATTLE-FIELD
FOR A WEEK OR MORE THEY STAYED IN HIS WOODS SOMETIMES IN A SECRET CAVE OF HIS WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THORGEST WAS ABOUT
THAT WAS CALLED THE STIRRUP-HORN BECAUSE AFTER THEY DRANK IT THE MEN PUT THEIR FEET TO THE STIRRUPS AND SPRANG UPON THEIR HORSES AND STARTED
BESIDES WE MUST LEAVE NONE OF THIS MEAD FOR HAVARD
THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO DO
I WILL GO AWAY AND FIND SOME OTHER PLACE SO HUNDREDS OF MEN SAILED AWAY
NORSEMEN'S THRALLS PLOWED THE SOIL AND PLANTED CROPS AND HERDED CATTLE AND GOLD FLOWED INTO THEIR MASTERS TREASURE-CHESTS
THIS IS BETTER THAN PULLING LEIF'S PLOW
BUT IT WAS SO FAR TO SEE THAT HE COULD NOT TELL ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING
THERE WERE HILLS AROUND IT
WE WILL GO IN AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A PLACE IT IS SO HE STEERED FOR IT
MY TONGUE REFUSES TO GIVE HER MESSAGE THE KING STAMPED HIS FOOT
DID NOT ALL HIS CATTLE DIE THERE OF HUNGER AND COLD AND DID HE NOT COME BACK TO NORWAY CURSING ICELAND OH SIGHVAT YOU ARE OLD AND FEARFUL CALLED OUT LEIF AND HE LAUGHED
FOES'-FEAR IS THIRSTY AND MY LEGS ARE STIFF WITH MUCH SITTING HE CALLED THREE MEN TO HIM
THEY ARE THE WORDS OF A SILLY GIRL IS THERE ANY MORE THE KING SHOUTED
IF LUCK IS WITH US WE WILL MEET AT THE SHIPS
A RED CLOAK WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS
WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL
KING HARALD WAS STILL IN THE STERN ON THE DECK
SURELY THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY THAN GREENLAND OR THAN ICELAND EITHER WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND
HE MUST HAVE DOGS FOR THE HUNT
THEY TOOK ME BEFORE KING HALFDAN
AND HAD A JOKE INTO THE BARGAIN
HE SPREAD OUT HIS OPEN HANDS TO THE NORSEMEN
MEN SAY THAT THE SWEETEST SONGS ARE IN ICELAND
BEDS AROUND THE SIDES OF THE FEAST HALL WERE SHUT-BEDS
ONE MORNING HIS QUEEN SAID TO HIM
SOME WISE MEN WROTE DOWN THE STORY OF THOSE VOYAGES AND OF THAT LAND AND PEOPLE READ THE TALE AND LIKED IT BUT NO ONE REMEMBERED WHERE THE PLACE WAS
I AM TIRED OF SEA SEA SEA AND NOTHING ELSE WE STARTED FOR ICELAND SAID INGOLF AND I WILL NOT STOP BEFORE I COME THERE
DID THEY NEVER SEE A BULL BEFORE LAUGHED ONE OF THE MEN
JUST AS THAT TREE SPREAD OUT UNTIL ALL OF NORWAY WAS IN ITS SHADE AND EVEN MORE LANDS SO HARALD IS KING OF ALL THIS COUNTRY AND OF THE WESTERN ISLANDS
HERE LIES A GREAT MAN SIGHVAT PUT A STONE ON THE TOP WITH RUNES ON IT TELLING WHOSE GRAVE IT WAS
THE SKY WAS BLACK
I SAW OUR CATTLE FEEDING ON THE SWEET GRASS
THEN THEY WILL BE NO BETTER THAN NORWAY
INGOLF WENT OUT AND STOOD ON A HIGH POINT OF LAND THAT JUTTED OUT INTO THE WATER
AFTER THAT SOME MEN WENT FISHING EVERY DAY IN THE ROWBOAT THAT THEY HAD
I VOW THAT I WILL GRIND MY FATHER'S FOES UNDER MY HEEL AND HARALD'S UNCLE CALLED OUT
REMEMBER WHAT FLOKI SAID OF THE ICE AND THE ROUGH SEA IN WINTER
HE CAUGHT MANY MEN BUT MOST OF THEM GOT AWAY AND WENT HOME LAUGHING AT HARALD
SPEARS WERE HURLED FROM DECK TO DECK AND MANY OF THEM BIT DEEP INTO MEN'S BODIES
IF CHILDREN STUDY PRODUCTS OF THESE ARTS AND ACTUALLY DO SOME OF THE WORK THEY WILL GAIN A QUICKENED SYMPATHY WITH THE PEOPLE AND AN APPRECIATION OF THEIR POWER
THERE SEEMS TO BE ONLY A FRINGE OF LAND AROUND THE EDGE OF AN ISLAND OF ICE THE WINTER NIGHTS WERE VERY LONG
HE WENT DOWN SLIDING AND JUMPING AND TEARING HIMSELF ON THE SHARP STONES
HELGA AND THE OTHER WOMEN FROM LEIF'S HOUSE SAT NEAR HUDDLED TOGETHER WHITE AND FRIGHTENED
THIS WILL BE THE LONGEST VOYAGE THAT SHE EVER MADE INGOLF SAID
THEY WERE ALL RICHLY DRESSED IN VELVET AND GOLD
THE TWO MEN WALKED UNDER THIS ARCH AND EACH MADE A LITTLE CUT IN HIS PALM
IN EVERY BOW MEN SLASHED WITH THEIR SWORDS AT THE FOES IN THE OPPOSITE SHIP
THE OTHERS WE SHUT INTO THEIR BEDS.[5 THE DOOR AT EACH END OF THE HALL WE HAD BARRED ON THE INSIDE SO THAT NOBODY COULD SURPRISE US
THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY
BUT THE PEOPLE GREW TIRED OF THIS LITTLE GOSSIP
SHIPS ALSO CAME FROM IRELAND AND FROM THE SHETLANDS AND THE ORKNEYS
SO I WILL STEER STRAIGHT WEST
SOMETIMES THEY SLEPT THERE WHEN IT WAS VERY COLD
ERIC KILLED THE MEN IN FAIR FIGHT
COULD IT BE THAT SHE HAD SENT THAT SAUCY MESSAGE TO KING HARALD
OUR MESSENGERS
THEN INGOLF SAID
THERE IS NO SPOT TO SPARE TOOLS AND CHESTS OF FOOD AND TUBS OF DRINK AND CHESTS OF CLOTHES AND FISHING NETS WERE STOWED IN THE BOWS OF BOTH BOATS
BOHN LONDON 1859 NORSE MYTHOLOGY ANDERSON
THIS HORN OF MEMORY I DRINK IN HONOR OF MY FATHER HALFDAN SON OF GUDROD WHO SITS NOW IN VALHALLA
DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
SO HE HAD KING ARNVID'S COUNTRY AND KING AUDBIORN'S COUNTRY
THE FATHER THOUGHT
FOR HIS FARM EVERY MAN SHALL PAY ME TAXES OVER EVERY COUNTRY HE PUT SOME BRAVE WISE MAN AND CALLED HIM EARL
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN BUT TYRKER STILL SMILING AND NODDING HIS HEAD ANSWERED IN GERMAN
THEN HE LAUGHED AS HE LOOKED AT HIS MEN
THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
FAR OFF IT LOOKS FLAT BUT WHEN YOU WALK UPON IT THERE ARE GREAT HOLES AND CRACKS
WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE THREW IT INTO THE BOTTOM
SO IN EVERY SHIP SHOWERS OF STONES AND ARROWS WERE FALLING AND MANY MEN DIED UNDER THEM OR GOT BROKEN ARMS OR LEGS
THERE ARE MANY OTHER ISLANDS HERE SAID LEIF
THEY ATE THE MEAT AND WORE THE SKINS TO KEEP THEM WARM
BUT THE WINTERS WERE LONG AND DARK AND COLD
MINOR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED WITHOUT NOTE
THESE NARROW TABLES STRETCHED ALL ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE HALL
OH HO CRIED KING HARALD
THIS WAY IS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE WOMEN SO HE DID
THEN GREAT WINDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND TOSSED HIS SHIP ABOUT SO THAT THE MEN COULD DO NOTHING
11 SEE NOTE ABOUT VALKYRIAS ON PAGE 198
I STRUCK MY SHIELD AGAINST THE DOOR SO THAT IT MADE A GREAT CLANGING HELLO
NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
WINELAND THE GOOD WINELAND THE WARM WINELAND THE GREEN THE GREAT THE FAT
IS THIS GUDRID YOUR DAUGHTER HE ASKED OF ERIC ONE DAY
OFTEN AT THE FEASTS THE MEN CAST LOTS TO SEE WHETHER THEY MIGHT SIT ON THE CROSS-BENCH WITH THE WOMEN
BUT I CAN ALMOST--YES I CAN SEE THE RED DRAGON ON THE ROOF OF THE FEAST HALL
WITH THIS HAND I LEAD MY DAUGHTER OUT OF MY HOUSE AND GIVE HER TO YOU HARALD SON OF HALFDAN TO BE YOUR WIFE
HE IS ONLY A LAD
FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS THEY COULD NOT SEE SUN OR STARS TO STEER BY
THEY CLOSED IN BATTLE WITH US AND KILLED MY MEN AND SUNK MY SHIP AND DRAGGED ME OFF A PRISONER
THE MEN FOUND A LITTLE DRIFTWOOD ALONG THE SHORE BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH
LET THE NEAREST KINSMAN OF EACH MAN COME AND TIE ON HIS HELL-SHOES
ARMOR LIES ON THE BENCHES
SHE HEARD THE SPEECH
LET US GO DOWN TO SEE THEM I WILL GO TOO GUDRID SAID
LEIF GOT READY THE BOAT AGAIN AND MERRILY SAILED FOR IRELAND
I CANNOT MAKE HEAD AGAINST IT
WE LANDED LATE AT NIGHT AND PULLED OUR BOAT UP ON SHORE AND WALKED QUIETLY TO THE HOUSE
AFTER A WHILE THE OTHER INDIAN TRIBES BEGAN TO GROW STRONG
DURING THE DAY THERE WERE REST TIMES WHEN NO BUSINESS WAS GOING ON
THERE WILL BE LITTLE PLAY OF SWORDS IN THIS EMPTY LAND AND I WANT TO HAVE ONE LAST GAME BEFORE I HANG UP MY BATTLE-KNIFE
SOME JUMPED UPON THE GUNWALE TO GET NEARER OR HUNG FROM THE PROW-HEAD
SOME WERE WHITE WITH A BLACK RAVEN OR A BROWN BEAR EMBROIDERED ON THEM OR BLUE WITH A WHITE SEA-HAWK OR BLACK WITH A GOLD SUN
A TERRIBLE ROARING CAME FROM THE CAVE
THERE STAND SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES IN THE STERN I CURVED THE TAIL UP ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE HEAD
NOW LOOK AT THIS MEAN HOUSE
A GERMAN NAMED TYRKER WAS WITH LEIF
IVAR HAS BEEN TO A STRANGE COUNTRY WHERE IT IS ALL SAND AND IS VERY HOT
CAN IT BE THIS LITTLE BABY OF MINE DECORATION FOOTNOTES
WHY DID YOU NOT SET OUT TO LOOK FOR HIM
HE HIMSELF WORKED MUCH AT THE FORGE MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOOLS--SPADES AXES HAMMERS HUNTING-KNIVES COOKING KETTLES
WILD SEA-BIRDS SCREAM AROUND THEM
WE SHALL ALL DRINK IN VALHALLA TO-NIGHT WELL I CRIED ODIN SHALL HAVE NO UNWILLING GUEST IN ME NOR IN ME CRIED HAKON
AFTER THIS YOU SHALL BE CALLED HARALD SHOCKHEAD
TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER YOU HAVE CARRIED YOURSELVES LIKE NOBLE MEN IN MY HOUSE ERIC ANSWERED
I SAT HIGH IN THE PILOT'S SEAT
BUT DO NOT DRAW UNTIL I COMMAND
THEY WERE LIKE BIG BOXES WITH DOORS OPENING INTO THE HALL
THERE ARE MANY ISLANDS NORTH OF SCOTLAND
MIDWINTER WAS COMING ON
IN SOME PLACES THE CABLES HAD BEEN CUT AND THE BOATS HAD DRIFTED APART
A MAP SHOWING THE JOURNEYS OF THE VIKINGS VIKING TALES BY JENNIE HALL THE FRANCIS W
I HAVE A VOW
THE SHIP WE WILL LOAD WITH LOGS FROM THESE GREAT TREES
KING HARALD WAS THAT GREAT TREE THEY SAID
DECORATION A READING LIST GEOGRAPHY NORWAY
A BOY THAT CAN FACE THE FALL OF AEGIR'S ROCK WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO FACE THE WAR FLASH WHEN HE IS A MAN HO I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE WAR FLASH NOW CRIED HARALD
PERHAPS HE WAS COMING TO ICELAND COMRADES
AND BUTTER THOROLF SAYS THAT BUTTER DROPS FROM EVERY WEED
4 SEE NOTE ABOUT FEAST HALL ON PAGE 196
THEN THEY CAME BACK AND TOOK EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE AND DRAGGED US TO THE BOAT AND SAILED HERE O MY BROTHER SAID INGOLF WHERE IS THAT SONG ABOUT THOSE TWO FOSTER-BROTHERS INGOLF AND LEIF WHO MADE A NEW COUNTRY IN A WONDERFUL LAND AND WHOSE SONS AND GRANDSONS ARE MIGHTY MEN IN ICELAND
THE STORY OF THE ERE-DWELLERS WITH THE STORY OF THE HEATH-SLAYINGS AS APPENDIX
THEY WERE STRANGE-LOOKING HOUSES--SHINING DRAGONS WITH GAY BACKS LYING ON THE YELLOW SAND
HIS FACE IS NOT THE FACE OF A FOOL
THAT FIRE GAVE THE ONLY LIGHT
IF THE LANDSCAPE IS STUDIED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FORMATION THE IMAGES WILL BE MORE ACCURATE AND MORE EASILY GAINED AND THE STUDY WILL HAVE A GENERAL VALUE THAT WILL CONTINUE PAST THE READING OF THESE STORIES INTO ALL WORK IN GEOGRAPHY
IVAR BROUGHT BEAUTIFUL STRIPED CLOTH FROM THERE AND WONDERFUL SWEET-SMELLING WATERS
MY MEN CAME IN AND LAY DOWN BY THE FIRE AND WARMED THEMSELVES BUT I SET TWO OF THEM AS GUARDS AT THE DOOR
THEY LOOKED AT HER FOSTER-FATHER
THEN A MAN RAISED A WHITE SHIELD AND GALLOPED TOWARD KING HARALD
ARE WE AFRAID OF ICE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS WORTH WHILE TO GO AND SEE MORE OF IT MY SON THORSTEIN AND I TRIED IT ONCE SAID ERIC
BUT WHEN THE TABLES WERE GONE AND THE HORNS WERE GOING AROUND HE STOOD UP AND RAISED HIGH A HORN OF ALE AND SAID LOUDLY
THE ROWERS BENCHES WERE ALONG THE SIDES
I WANT TO LIVE BY THE LAKE WHERE I CAN LOOK INTO THE GREEN WOODS AND HEAR SWEET BIRD-NOISES SO THORFINN BUILT HIS HUT THERE
GO ON SHE SAID
THE KINGS EITHER DIED IN BATTLE OR RAN AWAY AND HARALD HAD THEIR LANDS
STORY OF MARCO POLO
RAN[9 AND NOT YOU SHOCKHEAD SHALL HAVE THEM AND ME HE CRIED AND LEAPED LAUGHING INTO THE WATER AND WAS DROWNED
BUT WHENEVER A BATTLE WAS BEING FOUGHT THEY RODE THROUGH THE AIR ON THEIR HORSES AND WATCHED TO SEE WHAT WARRIORS WERE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO TO VALHALLA
EVERY MAN SNATCHED HIS WEAPONS AND JUMPED UPON HIS HORSE
I SEE SMOKE RISING FROM THAT ONE INGOLF SAID POINTING
IT SEEMS THAT THIS THORBIORN COMES OF A GOOD FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN RICH AND GREAT IN ICELAND FOR YEARS
IT IS A BIGGER BOAT THAN I EVER SAW BEFORE SAID ERIC
IF THAT IS TRUE HE FOUND AN EMPTY LAND AND IT WAS ESKIMOS THAT THORFINN SAW IN WINELAND
SEE HE SAID AND POINTED
SOME MEN COULD SING AND PLAY THE HARP
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO FAIR A LAND AS THIS SEEMS TO BE THEN HE WENT TO LEIF AND TALKED LONG WITH HIM
13 SEE NOTE ABOUT REYKJAVIK ON PAGE 199
AT THE END OF THE MEAL THEY CARRIED OUT TABLES AND ALL AND THE DRINKING-HORNS WENT ROUND IN A CLEAN ROOM
THAT WILL BE A WELCOME SHIPLOAD IN GREENLAND WHERE WE HAVE NEITHER TREES NOR VINES
I AM SICK OF THIS ENDLESS SEA THORHILD COMPLAINED BUT THIS LAND IS WORSE AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO SEE SMALL BAYS CUT INTO THE SHORE WITH LITTLE FLAT PATCHES OF GREEN AT THEIR SIDES
ONE OF THEM FOUND A RED CLOAK
BRING IVAR AND THORSTEIN."[2 THEY WERE CAPTAINS OF THE KING'S SOLDIERS
OLAF TURNS AND LAUGHS THAT WAS THE END OF OUR MEETING WITH KING HAVARD DECORATION FOOTNOTES
REMEMBER YOUR PILLARS O THOR HE CRIED
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER THING TO DO NOW
KING HARALD LOOKED UP AT HIS STANDARD AND LAUGHED ALOUD
BUT IT WAS STILL FAR OFF
HE HAD ON COARSE SHOES AND LEATHER LEGGINGS
THIS IS WHY ODIN KNOWS SO MANY THINGS REYKJAVIK REYKJAVIK MEANS SMOKY SEA INGOLF CALLED IT THAT BECAUSE OF THE STEAMING HOT-SPRINGS BY THE SEA

LEAD OUT THE BRIDE SO ERIC TOOK GYDA BY THE HAND AND LED HER OUT OF THE HALL
MORE THAN HALF THE MEN IN THE HALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET ERIC SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED
THE BRASS FRAME SHONE IN THE LIGHT
SO THE EARLS HAD OUT THEIR SHIPS ALL THE TIME TRYING TO CATCH SOLFI BUT HE WAS TOO CLEVER FOR THEM
MATERIALS FOR THIS STUDY ARE NOT DIFFICULT OF ACCESS
AFTER A WHILE MY MEN SAID
THEY HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN THEY SAW TYRKER RUNNING TOWARD THEM
AFTER BREAKFAST A HORN BLEW
THIS SHALL BE OUR HOME SO IT WENT UNTIL ALL THE LANDS ROUND ABOUT WERE COVERED WITH VIKINGS
