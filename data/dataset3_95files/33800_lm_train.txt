BUT RAPIDLY RECOVERING HIS FEET HE THREW HIMSELF FURIOUSLY UPON THE UNKNOWN WHOSE SLIM AND GRACEFUL FORM APPEARED TO BELIE THE POSSESSION OF THE IRRESISTIBLE STRENGTH HE HAD DISPLAYED
HA
HA
HA
HA
HA
OH BY THE HOLY
THAT IS INDEED A FRIGHTFUL IDEA
A MINUTE AFTERWARDS THE CHOUETTE ENTERED THE BILLIARD-ROOM ALONE
YOU HAVE PLUNGED GOD'S CREATURES INTO ETERNAL NIGHT
IF ONCE A PERSON CAN GET A HUNDRED FRANCS BEFOREHAND HE NEED NEVER FEAR FALLING INTO ANY ONE'S POWER
WHAT TUNE ARE YOU PLAYING I AM PLAYING TU N'AURAS PAS MA ROSE AND A VERY PRETTY TUNE IT IS
PERHAPS THAT WAS THE REASON WHY SHE BEAT ME OF AN EVENING
AND YET YOU AGREED WITH ME FOR SIX FRANCS WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO BATE ME DOWN AND WHEN DID THE COMMANDANT PAY YOU HIS NEXT VISIT I'LL TELL YOU,--AND GOOD FUN IT IS TOO
IF OUR JOB COMES OFF WELL WHY THEN IT IS ASTONISHING HOW WELL IT IS IMITATED CONTINUED RODOLPH
YOURS IS A NEW GAME AND YOU MUST TEACH IT TO ME I WILL RECOMMENCE WHENEVER YOU LIKE NOT ON ME THOUGH THANK YE,--NOT ON ME EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR LAUGHING
YES I HAD RESERVED ABOUT FIFTY FRANCS
BUT WHEN I WAS TURNED OF SIXTEEN THE PASSION BECAME SO STRONG THAT WHEN I ONCE BEGAN SLASHING I BECAME MAD
BUT THE CHARCOAL-MAN DID NOT APPEAR TO HEED THIS IN THE LEAST AND STILL KEPT HANGING ABOUT THE TAPIS-FRANC
RIGOLETTE BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF WOULD AFFORD MY LORD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING HUMAN NATURE AMID WANTS DIFFICULTIES AND MISERY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF WHICH HE IS FAR FROM SUSPECTING THUS YOU SEE MY DEAR MURPHY SAID M
THE ABBE LAPORTE WHO WAS SEATED NEAR THE FIREPLACE WAS UPWARDS OF EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE AND HAD EVER SINCE THE LAST DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION DONE DUTY IN THIS SMALL PARISH
HOW VERY STUPID OF ME NOT TO RECOLLECT THAT I MUST LEARN TO WRITE WELL IF I WISHED TO HELP MY AUNT CRIED THE YOUNG GIRL SO THOROUGHLY ABSORBED IN THE PICTURE OF THIS PEACEFUL LIFE AS TO BELIEVE FOR THE MOMENT IN ITS REALITY
MERELY TO LET YOU KNOW THE LADY IN THE HACKNEY-COACH HAS JUST ARRIVED WELL THEN YOU STUPID OLD FOOL SHOW HER UP DIRECTLY
THEN IN THE EVENING SHE WENT TO SELL FRIED FISH ON THE PONT NEUF
THEN RISING WITH AN AIR OF MODEST SUBMISSION FOLLOWED MADAME GEORGES WHO EYED HER WITH A PROFOUND INTEREST OUT OF THE ROOM
TO WHOM COULD WILLIS HAVE ADDRESSED HIS COMPLAINTS IF HE HAD ANY TO MAKE
FOR THE LIGHT GENUINE AIR EMBALMED WITH A THOUSAND RICH ODOURS APPEARED TO CAST A SORT OF SOMNOLENCY OVER THE SENSES
FORTUNATELY SHE MET ONE DAY AT THE END OF THE PONT NOTRE-DAME WITH GOUBIN'S WIFE WHO HAD BEEN HIDING FOR FOUR DAYS IN A CELLAR OF A HOUSE WHICH WAS BEING PULLED DOWN BEHIND THE HOTEL DIEU BUT WHY WAS GOUBIN'S WIFE HIDING TO ESCAPE FROM HER HUSBAND WHO THREATENED TO KILL HER
THE CORROSIVE ACTION OF THE VITRIOL HAD PUFFED OUT HIS LIPS
BUT REFLECTING THAT AS RODOLPH WAS VERY YOUNG AND HIS GENTLENESS AND GOODNESS HIS CHARACTER AT ONCE TIMID AND MEDITATIVE WERE GENERALLY SPOKEN OF SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT FIND COMPENSATION IN THE FEEBLE AND IRRESOLUTE DISPOSITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCE AND THEREFORE PERSISTED IN HER PROJECT AND AGAIN REVIVED HER HOPES
NO GOD KNOWS SPITE OF MY AGE MY FIGURE AND MY GRAVITY I WOULD DISGUISE MYSELF AS A ROPE-DANCER IF BY SO DOING I COULD SERVE YOU
MON DIEU WHO CAN KNOW YOUR CHARACTER YOUR FEELINGS IF I DO NOT,--I WHO HAVE NEVER LEFT YOU FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD
BUT I AM SURE IT IS NOT TRUE
I PASSED MY MOST COMFORTABLE NIGHTS IN THE LIME-KILNS AT CLICHY LIKE A REGULAR VAGABOND
YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER WHY DON'T YOU CURE YOURSELF THE BLACK REPLIED BY A NOBLE WORD AND A DIGNIFIED GESTURE
AN HONEST AND INDUSTRIOUS ARTISAN CRUSHED BY THE DEEPEST MISERY WAS WITH HIS WHOLE FAMILY ABOUT TO BE TURNED INTO THE STREETS THROUGH THE MEANS OF BRAS ROUGE
I WILL HAVE NO HAND IN IT,--SO DON'T RELY ON ME BUT IF HE WAKES WE WILL TAKE TO OUR HEELS WELL JUST AS YOU LIKE
IF YOUR PLATE AND PITCHER ARE EMPTY NO ONE WILL TOUCH THEM THE NEWCOMER LAUGHED LOUDLY AT THE JOKE OF THE OGRESS AND THEN SLIPPED OUT SO THAT HIS DEPARTURE WAS UNNOTICED
SUCH A BEAUTY AS THAT ORANGE ONE IS I WOULD NEVER HAVE TRUSTED IT TO SUCH GALS AS TOURNEUSE AND BOULOTTE
AND AT LAST HE WAS ONLY GOT RID OF BY PAYING HIM TWO QUARTERS RENT,--RATHER DROLL IS IT NOT FOR A LANDLORD TO PAY HIS LODGER
YOU HIDEOUS OLD HAG
HE IS LIKE A GOOD DOG BITES BUT DOESN'T BARK
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MAN WHO CURED ALFRED'S RHEUMATISM,--WHO DRAWS FIVE TEETH OUT OF SIX FOR NOTHING,--WHO HAS TESTIMONIES TESTIMONIALS FROM EVERY PRINCE AND KING IN THE WORLD,--AND ABOVE ALL PAYS AS HE GOES DOWN ON THE NAIL WOULD GO FOR TO DO SUCH THINGS
HIS PRETENSIONS TO FIRMNESS WOULD NOT ALLOW OF ANY ONE SEEING TO WHAT EXTENT THE SIMPLE WORDS OF GOUALEUSE HAD TOUCHED HIM
BUT HERE WE ARE AND IT'S TIME WE WERE FOR THE RAIN IS COMING DOWN AGAIN IN FLOODS
I SHALL COME AND SUPERINTEND THE REMOVAL OF MY GOODS
SHE THREW HERSELF BACK IN THE COACH AND PRESSED HER HANDKERCHIEF TIGHTLY TO HER EYES
I ALWAYS LOOKED UPON HIM AS BAD AS ALL THE REST WELL WELL DO NOT LET US TALK ANY MORE ABOUT HIM MY PRETTY FLEUR-DE-MARIE
A DIZZINESS OF SIGHT AND A CONFUSION OF IDEAS HAD WELL-NIGH DEPRIVED HIM OF ALL POWERS OF SIGHT OR SOUND
AS FAR AS MODERN DISCOVERY WENT AND THOSE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS WHICH HAVE A WHOLESOME INFLUENCE OVER THE WELL-BEING AND MORALS OF HIS PEOPLE THE GRAND DUKE WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE HIMSELF AND APPLY IT INVARIABLY FOR THE USE AND BENEFIT OF HIS PEOPLE HIS RESIDENTS AT THE CAPITALS OF THE DIFFERENT STATES OF EUROPE HAVING LITTLE ELSE TO OCCUPY THEMSELVES WHILST ON THEIR MISSION BUT TO KEEP THEIR MASTER FULLY INFORMED AS TO THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF SCIENCE AND ALL THE ARTS WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUBLIC UTILITY
POOR LITTLE CREATURE
THE CHOUETTE WAS ALSO IN HER SUNDAY COSTUME WEARING A LARGE SHAWL OF FINE WOOL WITH A LARGE PATTERN AND HELD IN HER HAND A CAPACIOUS BASKET
WHAT I GIVE YOU I GIVE BECAUSE YOU HAVE DESERVED IT I SAID THE CHOURINEUR WHOSE EMBARRASSMENTS RECOMMENCED I DESERVE IT
YOU THEN OUGHT TO PUT US IN THE WAY OF REGAINING OUR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS NOTHING EASIER
AFTER A MOMENT OF PROFOUND MEDITATION THE CHOURINEUR LESS FROM ANY NEED HE FELT FOR REPOSE THAN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DOCTOR'S COMMANDS TOOK A CHAIR WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN WITH AN AIR OF INTENSE SELF-SATISFACTION AT HAVING AT LENGTH DEVISED A PLAN TO ACT IN STRICT CONFORMITY WITH THE ORDERS RECEIVED AND YET AVOID ALL RISK OF SOILING THE SILKEN CUSHION
AND WE ARE SURE OF HIS FIDELITY FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE HAS NOTHING TO GAIN THOUGH A GREAT DEAL TO LOSE BY DECEIVING US
GO AND LOOK FOR GOUALEUSE THE OGRESS POCKETED THE GOLD THINKING THAT THE WORKMAN HAD COMMITTED A ROBBERY OR RECEIVED A LEGACY AND THEN SAID WITH A NASTY LEER WELL INDEED
I WANT TO STEP UP TO MY WAREHOUSE WHERE IS THAT AT THE TOP OF THIS LADDER IS THE LANDING-PLACE ON WHICH THE DOOR OF MOREL'S GARRET OPENS AND IN THE WAINSCOTING OF THIS LANDING IS A SMALL DARK CUPBOARD WHERE I KEEP MY LEATHER AND THE WALL IS SO FULL OF CRACKS THAT WHEN I AM IN THIS HOLE I CAN SEE AND HEAR EVERYTHING THE SAME AS IF I WAS IN MOREL'S ROOM
TIS TRUE THAT SOME ILL-NATURED PERSONS ARE FOUND TO ASSERT THAT OWING EITHER TO FORTUNATE SPECULATIONS OR LUCKY HITS UPON THE STOCK EXCHANGE UNDERTAKEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED CHARLES ROBERT THE WORTHY NOTARY COULD NOW WELL AFFORD TO PAY BACK THE ORIGINAL LOAN WITH HIGH INTEREST
MANY OF THE LADIES PRESENT LOOKED AT HER WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR AND WHISPERED TO THEIR NEIGHBOURS
IT IS ALL I POSSESS IN THE WORLD WHAT HAVE YOU NOTHING ELSE NOTHING THIS CORAL NECKLACE BELONGS TO THE OGRESS AND YOU HAVE NOT A PIECE OF RIBAND A CAP OR HANDKERCHIEF NO NOTHING,--NOTHING BUT THE DEAD BRANCHES OF MY POOR ROSE-TREE
I SEE NOW THAT I WAS GUILTY OF A GREAT RUDENESS
I BESEECH YOU NOT TO OVERWHELM HIM BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF YOUR MYTHOLOGICAL ALLUSIONS
MY LODGING--NO NO THAT WILL NOT DO
THIS EVENING!--IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED HE
AT THIS JUNCTURE SEYTON WAS CHARGED BY THE GRAND DUKE WITH AN ERRAND TO VISIT SEVERAL BREEDING STUDS IN AUSTRIA
VERY MUCH INDEED M
I LOOKED OUT FOR WORK
RODOLPH YOU HAVE UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSED ME MUCH PAIN
WAS NOT HER CULPABLE INDIFFERENCE THE CAUSE OF HER CHILD'S DEATH
THEN RUN AND GET ASSISTANCE IF YOU HAVE STRENGTH LEFT
NO ONE PASSED
TWO THOUSAND FRANCS TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU MASTER RODOLPH
HIS WIFE IS CHARMING AND AS PRUDENT AS SHE IS LOVELY TRUE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ONLY HAD RECOURSE TO THE INQUIRIES WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OVER AFTER HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED TO PENETRATE THE CAUSE OF M
MY LORD SAID HE DESPONDINGLY YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND INDEED TO ME
THIS VERY NIGHT YOU CAME HERE TO ROB AND YOU HAVE STABBED THE MASTER OF THIS HOUSE IT WAS YOU WHO SUGGESTED THIS ROBBERY ASSUMING AN AIR OF ASSURANCE
NOM DE NOM I WISH I WAS AT IT
THE SCHOOLMASTER'S TERRORS HAD DURING THIS LONG DISCOURSE ENTIRELY YIELDED TO AN OPINION THAT HE WAS ONLY TO BE SUBJECTED TO A LONG LECTURE ON MORALITY AND SO FORTH AND THEN DISCHARGED UPON HIS OWN PROMISE OF AMENDMENT
NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED MORE HORRIBLE THAN THE COUNTENANCE OF THIS MAN
BUT TO RETURN TO WHAT YOU WERE TELLING ME TO WHAT M
A SENSATION OF EXTREME COLD ABOUT HIS FEET INDUCED HIM TO ENDEAVOUR BY FEELING THE GROUND TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE
TAKE OFF YOUR SHAWL FINETTE OR YOU'LL BE COLD WHEN YOU GO OUT
THE FOUR STORIES
HIS FINGERS DABBLED IN A POOL OF WATER
FROM UNDER HIS SKY BLUE VELVET CAP WITH A BRIGHT LEATHER PEAK SEVERAL LOCKS OF CHESTNUT HAIR WERE SEEN
I HAD THE BAPTISM OF A DOG IN A DITCH AND THEY CALLED ME FELLOW OR YOU SIR OR ALBINO IT IS REALLY SURPRISING MY WENCH HOW MUCH WE RESEMBLE EACH OTHER SAID THE CHOURINEUR
A FRESH TRIAL OF HIS FORTITUDE AWAITED HIM
RODOLPH DID NOT TELL YOU BUT WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL FROM THE MASTER WHO EMPLOYS ME BECAUSE IF HE IS OFFENDED BY IT--WHY THEN YOU SEE--WHY AFTERWARDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY I MEAN TO SAY WELL WHAT THAT I AM A CONVICT WHO HAS SERVED HIS TIME,--THAT I HAVE BEEN AT THE BAGNE SAID CHOURINEUR IN A LOW VOICE
WHY A WORKMAN MAY LIVE WELL UPON THREE FRANCS A DAY
IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE PREFERS SECLUSION AND IS IN THE HABIT OF MAKING FREQUENT EXCURSIONS TO THE ENVIRONS OF PARIS AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE COUNTESS SARAH MACGREGOR AND HER BROTHER NO PERSON IS AWARE OF THE DISGUISES ASSUMED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE POOR DARLING HAS BEEN SADLY OUT OF SPIRITS LATELY AND I GOT THIS DAINTY DISH TO CHEER HIM UP A BIT
MAXIMILIAN RODOLPH 10TH DECEMBER 1764
BUT TO OUR BUSINESS YES LET US TALK OF BUSINESS
THE DEATH OF THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD YOU JUST NOW ALLUDED TO HAS BROKEN THE LAST TIE WHICH MIGHT HAVE ATTACHED MY LORD TO THIS DANGEROUS WOMAN
YOU KNOW TOO THAT I CANNOT PREVENT THE DEEP AND ALMOST PAINFUL SYMPATHY I FEEL FOR YOUNG GIRLS OF THAT AGE TRUE MY LORD
LANK MEAN-LOOKING AND FEEBLE THIS MAN MIGHT BE FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE HAD A BELLYFUL OF SUCH DOINGS AND TO-MORROW I SHALL GET BACK TO MY TIMBER-PILE AND EARN AN HONEST DINNER BEFORE I EAT IT
LET US TALK NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT AT THIS MOMENT THE CARRIAGE REACHED ST OUEN WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES TO ST DENIS AND THE REVOLTE
POOR FOLKS SUCH AS WE ARE SHOULD NOT SHRINK FROM SUCH THINGS TIS NOT THE DYING IN A CHARITABLE INSTITUTION I DREAD OR THE POVERTY THAT WOULD SEND ME INTO IT BUT THE THOUGHTS OF WHAT THEY DO TO YOUR LIFELESS REMAINS WHAT DO THEY DO THAT SHOCKS YOU SO MUCH IS IT POSSIBLE M
LIKE A SKILFUL INTRIGUER HE SOON INFORMED THE ASPIRING PAIR THAT THEY MUST COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HIM AS HE ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE TO THE GRAND DUKE FOR THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
THE DOCTOR WAS PREPARED FOR THIS ANTIPATHY AND WAS SECRETLY DELIGHTED AT IT FOR IN ANOTHER WAY THE HOPES OF THIS MAN WERE AS AMBITIOUS AS THOSE OF SARAH
AND HOW DID YOU ESCAPE HER THEN INQUIRED RODOLPH OF THE GOUALEUSE
PREPARATIONS 150 XIV
DO YOU KNOW THAT I THINK HE LOOKS HANDSOMER THAN EVER
ALTHOUGH VERY RIDICULOUS YET THE BROTHER AND SISTER'S AMBITION WAS FREED FROM ALL SHAMEFUL MODES
AND MATTERS HAD REACHED THUS FAR WHEN THE SCHOOLMASTER RECEIVED THE JUST PUNISHMENT OF HIS CRIMES
THERE REMAIN FORTY SOUS
WHAT YOU BUT JUST NOW INTIMATED OF HIS DEPRESSED AND UNHAPPY APPEARANCE HAS CAUSED ME MUCH PAIN NAY MY DEAR FRIEND I MEANT NOT TO GRIEVE YOU BUT MERELY TO POINT OUT THE PROBABILITY THAT A MAN RENDERED DOUBLY SENSITIVE BY THE SUCCESSION OF PAST MISFORTUNES MIGHT FEEL HIS COURAGE INSUFFICIENT TO ENCOUNTER THE FRESH TRIAL OF YOUR REJECTION OF HIS SUIT AND THUS BE INDUCED TO END HIS HOPELESS LOVE AND HIS LIFE TOGETHER OH NO MORE
I GIVE IT TO YOU THE CHOURINEUR ROCKED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON HIS CHAIR SCRATCHED HIS HEAD COUGHED LOOKED DOWN ON THE GROUND AND MADE NO REPLY
A FORTNIGHT AFTER HER ARRIVAL THE YOUNG SCOTCH GIRL ENDUED WITH SO PROFOUND A SPIRIT OF OBSERVATION HAD EASILY PENETRATED THE FIRM CHARACTER AND OPEN HEART OF THE GRAND DUKE
HOW THEN DO I KNOW IN WHICH DIRECTION TO GO
HE STARTED FROM HER WITH MINGLED DISGUST AND HORROR
AND WHY NOT
SHALL I FASTEN HIM TO THE RING MASTER FASTEN HIM
NO MUCH AS I ENJOY TO-DAY'S TREAT I WOULD CHEERFULLY GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS OF EVER PASSING SUCH ANOTHER IF I THOUGHT IT COULD IN ANY WAY INJURE YOU INJURE ME
AFTER HAVING BEEN TWO YEARS A WIFE DAVID WHOSE CONFIDENCE IN HER WAS ONLY EQUALLED BY HIS LOVE LEARNED THE FULL EXTENT OF HER INFAMY,--A THUNDERBOLT AROUSED HIM FROM HIS BLIND SECURITY THEY SAY HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE YES
THE CHOUETTE IS TO BE HERE DIRECTLY TO RETURN THE POCKETBOOK AND TO KNOW WHAT IS REQUIRED FROM THEM WHICH SHE IS TO TELL THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO WILL UNDERTAKE IT FLEUR-DE-MARIE STARTED
YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SUPPOSE THE POOR GIRL BLUSHED AND DID NOT LOOK AT RODOLPH
BUT WHEN HER FISH WAS COOKED SHE CAME TOWARDS ME
HE HAD LONG MUSCULAR ARMS HANDS SHORT THICK AND HAIRY TO THE VERY FINGERS END WITH LEGS SOMEWHAT BOWED WHOSE ENORMOUS CALVES BETOKENED HIS VAST STRENGTH
I KNOW NOTHING SO HARD TO BEAR AS THAT MAN'S COMPANY
PIPELET ELEVATED HIS CLASPED HANDS TOWARDS THE CEILING AND ALLOWED A HEAVY SOUND BETWEEN A GRUNT AND A GROAN TO ESCAPE HIS OVERCHARGED BREAST
IT WAS TIME
THE BIGNONIA OF INDIA WITH ITS LONG CUP-SHAPED FLOWER OF DARK SULPHUR COLOUR AND SLIGHT SLENDER LEAVES WAS PLACED BESIDE THE DELICATE FLESH-COLOURED PETALS OF THE STEPHANOTIS SO JUSTLY APPRECIATED FOR ITS EXQUISITE PERFUME
YOU SEE THEY HAVE NOT THE COURAGE TO DO THEIR DIRTY TRICKS THEMSELVES
WELL MY LITTLE FLEUR-DE-MARIE WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS
I NEVER KNEW THEM SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE
I SAY AGAIN HOW MUCH FOR THE GARMENTS THE POOR GIRL IS WEARING THE OGRESS DIVIDED BETWEEN HER DESIRE TO MAKE A GOOD HARVEST HER SURPRISE TO SEE A WORKMAN WITH SO MUCH MONEY THE FEAR OF BEING CHEATED AND THE HOPES OF STILL GREATER GAIN WAS SILENT FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN REPLIED OH THEM THINGS IS WELL WORTH A HUNDRED FRANCS WHAT
THE SIGHT OF MURPHY SPEEDING THROUGH THE ALLEE DES VEUVES DID NOT QUITE ASSURE HIM
I MAKE BUT A BAD RECOMPENSE FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS TO ME BUT NOT AT ALL MY GOOD FELLOW
YESTERDAY I WENT BUT IN VAIN TO FIND A CERTAIN FELLOW CALLED BRAS ROUGE WHO MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN ME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR SON
IT APPEARS HE HAS BLOWN THE GAFF IN THE JOB AT NANTES SO BRAS ROUGE DECLARES WHY THAT IS GROS-BOITEUX'S AFFAIR
AND WHAT A GOOD GIRL SHE IS
THE LAST DESPATCHES WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR OF SENDING TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ANNOUNCED THAT ALL WAS GOING ON WELL AT HOME
HERE TAKE MY ARM
HE WILL HEAR THEIR CRIES AND HE WILL SAVE THEM NOW DESERVE HIS BOUNTY BY YOUR CONDUCT AND YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND ONE READY TO ENCOURAGE AND SUSTAIN YOU IN THE GOOD PATH ON WHICH YOU HAVE ENTERED
BUT IT HAPPENED THAT I HAD FOR MY WASHERWOMAN A WOMAN CALLED LORRAINE A POOR THING WITH NONE BUT THE GOOD GOD TO PROTECT HER
WHO THE DEVIL IS THIS THEN SAID THE RUFFIAN MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS ADVERSARY WHOSE EXTRAORDINARY POWER ASTONISHED HIM
IT IS PEGRIOTTE WHO STOLE MY BARLEY-SUGAR
I MUST HAVE YOU ADMIT THAT THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE MUST SHINE PREEMINENTLY BEAUTIFUL ANY AND EVERY WHERE
WELL THEY QUITE LOOKED DOWN UPON ME
BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE BESIDES M
HE ENTREATED,--SUPPLICATED AND HIS MASTER LOST HIS TEMPER
CESAR BRADAMANTI AND UNLESS YOU ARE PUT ON YOUR GUARD AGAINST THESE REPORTS THEY MIGHT LEAD TO YOUR BREAKING OFF WITH HIM
ALL THIS IS TAKEN FROM SOME PRETTY LANDSCAPE YOU HAVE BEEN PAINTING ON A FAN
BUT WITH MY CIGAR I SHALL SMOKE YOU LIKE HERRINGS
YOU SAID TO YOURSELF,'LET US SEE IF THIS CHOURINEUR IS SUCH A GULPIN AS TO BELIEVE THAT I WILL MAKE HIM SUCH A PRESENT ENOUGH ENOUGH M
THAT IS PLAIN ENOUGH
THE DOCTOR CONFESSED TO HIMSELF WITH DELECTABLE CYNICISM THAT HE FELT A NATURAL AFFINITY FOR ROGUES AND VILLAINS AND SO HE SAID THAT WITHOUT PRETENDING TO DISCOVER THE END WHICH SARAH AND HER BROTHER DESIRED TO ACHIEVE HE WAS ATTRACTED TOWARDS THEM BY A SYMPATHY SO STRONG AS TO LEAD HIM TO IMAGINE THAT THEY PLOTTED SOME DEVILISH PURPOSE
RODOLPH HAS NOT FORGOTTEN ME M
WE MUST BE IN PARIS IN GOOD TIME THANKS TO THE CARE OF MADAME GEORGES FLEUR-DE-MARIE WAS NO LONGER LIKE HER FORMER SELF
I AM WELL AWARE WHAT ARE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S INTENTIONS IN THE MATTER
IT IS NOT WEATHER TO TURN A MANGY CUR OUT-OF-DOORS AND IT WILL BE AN AMUSEMENT
THE OLD MARQUIS ENTERTAINED THE MOST PERFECT FRIENDSHIP AND ESTEEM FOR MADAME GEORGES BUT HOW FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MY DEAR MURPHY DID IT EVER COME ABOUT THAT THE D'HARVILLE FAMILY EVER PERMITTED A DESCENDANT OF THEIRS TO MARRY SUCH A MONSTER AS THIS DURESNEL WHY THUS IT WAS
HOPE NOT THAT I MEAN SO SPEEDY A TERMINATION TO YOUR JUST PUNISHMENT
HE ACTUALLY HAD THE MEANNESS TO EXAMINE HIS WOOD AND PUT OUT THE QUANTITY HE SHOULD ALLOW TO BE BURNT WHILE HE WAS AWAY
CHAPTER XII
BUT THANK GOD
AH SIR SINCE CABRION LEFT HE HAS ALL BUT DRIVEN ME STARK STARING MAD DID YOU THEN SO MUCH REGRET HIM ASKED RODOLPH
WELL THEN FRIEND PIPELET CABRION HAS SENT ME FOR A PIECE OF YOUR HAIR
A HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE
WELL AT LAST WE GOT UP INTO OUR COCK-LOFT
DEALERS IN OLD CLOTHES AND MARINE STORES UNDER THE PILLARS OF THE MARKET-PLACE HOW DID YOU SPEND WHAT THEY LEFT YOU INQUIRED THE CHOURINEUR
HE'S A TRAP LOOK OUT FOR SQUALLS THE TWO RUFFIANS ONE OF WHOM WITH THE GREEK SKULL-CAP PULLED OVER HIS BROWS HAD INQUIRED SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE GROS-BOITEUX EXCHANGED RAPID GLANCES OF THE EYE AND RISING SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR
THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG SCOTCH LADY WAS AN EVENT IN THE GERMAN COURT SO QUIET SIMPLE AND ALMOST PATRIARCHAL IN ITS HABITS AND OBSERVANCES
I HAD ONLY COLLECTED THREE SOUS AND I HAD EATEN SIX SOUS WORTH
SHOULD YOU NOT LIKE SUCH NICE THINGS AS CARRIAGES DIAMONDS AND RICH CLOTHES NOT AT ALL
BE ON YOUR GUARD RESOLVED NOT TO GO TO THE ALLEE DES VEUVES BEFORE THAT MOMENT NOR TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE SCHOOLMASTER FOR AN INSTANT HE YET TREMBLED AT THE IDEA OF LOSING THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY THAT MIGHT EVER BE AFFORDED HIM OF OBTAINING THAT SECRET WHICH HE WAS SO EXCESSIVELY ANXIOUS TO POSSESS
MY VERY BLINDNESS I OWE TO YOU
YES THEN THE PIGEON-HOUSE YES SO WE SHOULD OH HOW VERY VERY NICE ONLY TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS BUT LET ME FINISH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FARM YES PRAY DO
SOMETIMES HANGING THEIR LONG WREATHS OF LEAVES AND FLOWERS IN GRACEFUL FESTOONS THEN DEPENDING LIKE BLOOMING SERPENTS FROM THE TALL BOUGHS
I AM INDEED SOMETIMES OBLIGED TO MODERATE HIS ENERGY
THREE TIMES DID HE WRITE SAME AS TO-DAY ORDERING US TO LIGHT A FIRE AND HAVE EVERYTHING READY FOR THE RECEPTION OF A LADY HE EXPECTED WOULD COME
OR DYING AS YOU HAVE LIVED EXHALE YOUR LAST SIGH WITH AN IMPIOUS SCOFF OR PROFANE BLASPHEMY
APROPOS OF LA GOUALEUSE
BEFORE SHE BEGAN TO SEDUCE HIS SON,--A THING OF COURSE,--SHE HAD WISELY RESOLVED TO DISCOVER THE DISPOSITION OF THE FATHER
HE IS RECOVERING FROM HIS STUPOR SAID THE DOCTOR SPEAKING TO HIMSELF
NOW I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT WOULD SATISFY ME IN EVERY RESPECT
POOR GOUALEUSE FELT HER CHEEKS FLUSH AND HER HEART BEAT AS SHE TIMIDLY DESCENDED FROM THE VEHICLE
IT IS AT THE SAME TIME A REDOUBT AND A FARM
IT RAINED IN TORRENTS AND I TOOK SHELTER IN THE ALLEY
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
SECONDLY A YOUNG FEMALE WHO FROM APPEARANCES MIGHT UNHAPPILY BE THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE COMMANDANT FOR THE MORROW,--PERHAPS TO HER OWN UTTER RUIN AND DISGRACE
FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING BROUGHT ON AN INFLAMMATORY ATTACK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DESCRIPTION THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH APPEARED WITH THE RAPIDITY PECULIAR TO SUCH AFFECTIONS
I WILL EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU YES IF YOU LIKE BUT NOT UNLESS
THE CHOUETTE RETURNED TO THE ROOM BRINGING THE CIGARS WITH HER
YOU STABBED A MAN THAT YOU MIGHT ROB HIM
THE RENDEZVOUS OF THE CHOUETTE IS ONLY FOUR STEPS OFF AT THE CROSS-ROAD AND I WILL LAY A BET THEY COME AND SIT HERE WHEN THEY ARRIVE
AND IF THAT IS TO BE THE GAME I AM YOUR MAN
BUT FEELING IT UNSAFE TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT FARTHER AT THIS MOMENT SO AS TO AWAKEN THE MARQUISE'S MISTRUST OF HER FRIENDLY INTENTIONS BY WAY THEREFORE OF CONCEALING HER REAL SUSPICIONS SHE CONTINUED
NOT I
SUPPOSE THAT THIS ROAD--I SAY THIS ROAD BECAUSE WE HAPPEN TO BE ON IT YES YES OF COURSE
THEN I REMEMBERED TOO LATE WHAT RIGOLETTE HAD TOLD ME
OUR POOR FRIEND M
ONE A LARGE KITCHEN FOR THE FARM SERVANTS AND THE OTHER FOR THE OWNER OF THE PLACE MAKE THAT ROOM HAVE GREEN BLINDS M
MY DIPLOMATIC POSITION AFFORDS AN EXCELLENT PRETEXT FOR THE INQUIRIES I HAVE UNDERTAKEN
OH GO ON--GO ON PLEASE M
I HAD NOT TASTED FOOD FOR TWO DAYS
BECAUSE YOU REPUDIATE IT UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLE THAT MIGHT INDUCE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WELL AWARE OF HER CHARMS TO SAY TO ONE OF HER MOST ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRERS I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL HOW HANDSOME I AM AND THEREFORE YOUR APPROVAL IS PERFECTLY UNCALLED FOR AND UNNECESSARY
I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD AND I THANK YOU MUCH
BUT SAD TO SAY I WAS IDLE
I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU FEEL AS I DO BUT THE MORNING AIR HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE THE CHOUETTE WAS AWAITING THEM AT THE DOOR
THE FACE WAS SEEN BUT FOR AN INSTANT AND VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A MERE CREATION OF FANCY LEAVING RODOLPH IN A STATE OF PERTURBATION IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE
I DID NOT THINK OF THAT
BUT NOW I SINCERELY REPENT EVER HAVING LISTENED TO HER
AT LENGTH NO DOUBT REMAINED AND SHE RECOGNISED THE GOUALEUSE
THESE WRETCHES AWARE THAT THEY HAD BETRAYED THEMSELVES TO THE YOUNG MAN AND DREADING THE USE HE MIGHT MAKE OF HIS INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY UPON FINDING HE HAD QUITTED NANTES FOLLOWED HIM TO PARIS WITH THE MOST SINISTER INTENTIONS OF SILENCING HIM FOR EVER
LOVE OF A BRIGHT BOY COME ALONG
A NARROW PATH WHICH EXTENDED ALONG THIS DITCH LED FROM THE STAIRS TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT
MOTHER
MERRILL IN HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE CHOURINEUR RODOLPH HAD NEITHER BETRAYED ANGER NOR HATRED
BUT WORSE LUCK THERE WAS NO WAR BUT A GREAT DEAL OF DISCIPLINE
IT IS NOW ONLY SEVEN O'CLOCK
AND THE OVERLOOKING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FARM MAY SERVE TO RECREATE HER THOUGHTS AND PREVENT THEM FROM DWELLING TOO DEEPLY ON HER PAST SORROWS
NOW I DO NOT CARE EVER TO KNOW MY PARENTS WHILST LA CHOUETTE WAS SPEAKING THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD RESUMED HIS ASSURANCE FOR LOOKING AT RODOLPH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A YOUNG MAN OF SLIGHT AND GRACEFUL MAKE COULD FOR A MOMENT COPE WITH HIM AND CONFIDENT IN HIS BRUTAL FORCE HE APPROACHED THE DEFENDER OF GOUALEUSE AND SAID TO THE CHOUETTE IN AN IMPERIOUS VOICE
I WENT WITH IT INTO THE LIME-KILN LIKE A WOLF TO HIS LAIR AND THEN WITH THE LEAVE OF THE LIME-BURNERS I MADE A GLORIOUS FRY ON THE ASHES
BUT WILL YOU COME INTO THE SHOP UNTIL OUR HORSE HAS RESTED AWHILE THE CHOURINEUR AND MURPHY ENTERED THE SHOP AND THEN WENT TO SEE THE YARD WHERE THREE SPLENDID OXEN AND A SCORE OF SHEEP WERE FASTENED UP
GO SEEK OUT SOME SAFE AND SOLITARY DWELLING WHERE BY HUMBLE REPENTANCE YOU MAY SEEK TO PROPITIATE AN OFFENDED GOD
YOU ARE THE BETTER MAN THAT'S CLEAR
WHEN THE UNKNOWN THE CHOURINEUR AND THE GOUALEUSE PROCEEDED TO THE PUBLIC-HOUSE THE CHARCOAL-MAN FOLLOWED THEM
AS I WAS VERY LITTLE I WAS ABLE TO CREEP UNDER AN OLD DOOR AND HIDE MYSELF AMONGST A HEAP OF LOGS
BUT YOU WILL NOT FIND THAT I SHALL SUGGEST ANY INFAMOUS PLAN TO YOU
SO CAN THEY WHO LIKE LEAN
FORGIVE YOUR OLD AND FAITHFUL MURPHY
FAR FROM BEING UNRELENTING AS DEATH YOUR SENTENCE SHALL BRING FORTH GOOD FRUITS FOR HEREAFTER
THERE ARE PECULIAR GLANCES OF THE EYE WHICH ARE IRRESISTIBLE AND CERTAIN CELEBRATED DUELLISTS ARE SAID TO OWE THEIR BLOODY TRIUMPHS TO THIS FASCINATING GLANCE WHICH UNMANS PARALYSES AND DESTROYS THEIR ADVERSARIES
DAVID HAVING FOR EIGHT YEARS STUDIED WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AND REMARKABLE EFFECT RECEIVED THE DEGREE OF SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SUCCESS AND THEN RETURNED TO AMERICA TO PLACE HIMSELF AND HIS SKILL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS MASTER BUT DAVID OUGHT TO HAVE CONSIDERED HIMSELF FREE AND EMANCIPATED IN FACT AND IN LAW WHEN HE SET FOOT IN FRANCE DAVID'S LOYALTY IS VERY RARE
IT WAS NECESSARY TO APPROACH THE DOOR WHICH SMELLED SO STRONGLY OF THE CASH SO I PRETENDED THAT I WAS SEIZED WITH A FIT OF COUGHING,--SO VIOLENT THAT I WAS COMPELLED TO LEAN AGAINST THE WALL FOR SUPPORT
QUITE RIGHT,--GO ON AND THEN WE SHOULD GO AND SEE ALL THE COWS TO BE SURE WE SHOULD AND AFTERWARDS VISIT THE DAIRY VISIT THE DAIRY
DO YOU MEAN SAID HE AT LENGTH TO PUT THE GENTLEMAN'S LETTER IN OH YES THAT IS ALL RIGHT REPLIED THE PORTERESS
WELL I HAVE COIN ENOUGH LEFT TO PAY HIM IN FULL SAID RODOLPH IN A CARELESS TONE
AND THEN THE HABIT
FROM THE RUE ST DOMINIQUE CORNER OF THE RUE BELLE CHASSE RODOLPH STARTED AT THESE WORDS
CHAPTER II
HIS GAZE WAS FIXED AND FEARFUL
PARDON FOR THE BARON EXCLAIMED THE SQUIRE LAUGHING
DAVID URGED BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN
I SHOULD SAY THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD BEGUN BY ROBBING HIM AND THAT IT WAS AFTER THAT THAT THEY BEGAN TO PARLEY AND TO COME TO FRIENDLY TERMS IT IS VERY STRANGE MON DIEU IT MAKES ME QUITE FRIGHTENED ON YOUR ACCOUNT M
THEN SURE AS A GUN THEY'LL TRY IT ON THIS VERY NIGHT
YOU MORE WISELY AND BENEVOLENTLY HAVE DIRECTED YOUR EXERTIONS FOR THE BETTERING YOUR FELLOW CREATURES
CHAPTER IV
HERE IS A WOMAN'S CLOAK SAID GOUALEUSE REMARKING THAT SHE HAD SEATED HERSELF ON THE GARMENT WITHOUT HAVING AT FIRST NOTICED IT
CHAPTER VI
BUT BE SO GOOD AS TO EXCUSE MY HAND
I ASSERT BY MY HONOUR THAT ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MURPHY LIVES AND THAT HIS CHANCE OF RECOVERY IS ALL BUT CERTAIN YOU SAY THAT BUT TO PREPARE ME FOR MORE DISASTROUS TIDINGS
NOW FLEUR-DE-MARIE HERE WE ARE
IF YOU HAVE ANY SUCH INTENTION LET US GIVE UP THE JOB ALTOGETHER
NOW MY BOY SAID HE WE ARE LISTENING THE CHOURINEUR EMPTIED HIS GLASS AND THUS BEGAN
WELL MY LITTLE WHITE FACE DOST HEAR ME SAID THE MONSTER ADVANCING
AND WHEN I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD GIVE HER LEAVE TO PASS THE DAY IN THE COUNTRY I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE GONE CRAZY,--FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE SHE WAS INCLINED TO THROW HER ARMS ABOUT MY NECK THAT WAS HER DELIGHT AT LEAVING YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE ENTERED AT THIS MOMENT DRESSED AS SHE WAS THE OVER-NIGHT WITH HER GOWN OF BROWN STUFF HER LITTLE ORANGE SHAWL TIED BEHIND HER AND HER HANDKERCHIEF OF RED CHECKS OVER HER HEAD LEAVING ONLY TWO THICK BANDS OF LIGHT HAIR VISIBLE
WHEN THEY HAD SEEN ALL BUT THE UP-STAIRS MURPHY SAID
AND IF THEY SUIT I WILL ENGAGE THEM AT ONCE AND LEAVE A DEPOSIT THE PORTER FOLLOWED BY RODOLPH EMERGED FROM THE GLOOMY LODGE AND PROCEEDED UP-STAIRS
THAT MAKES ME THINK THAT WHEN I SEE A NOTICE OF A DOG THAT HAS BEEN LOST I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE A COMPARISON AND THE OFFER OF A HUNDRED FRANCS REWARD FOR HIS DISCOVERY I SAY TO MYSELF ANIMAL IF YOU WERE LOST NO ONE WOULD GIVE A HUNDRED FARTHINGS TO FIND YOU TWO THOUSAND FRANCS TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU
IT WAS EASY TO ASCERTAIN THE ABODE OF HIS NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOUR MLLE
AND AMONGST OTHERS THREE WEEKS AGO A CATTLE-DEALER ON THE ROAD TO POISSY WHOM THEY ALSO ROBBED HE WILL BE TAKEN SOONER OR LATER THEY MUST BE VERY CUNNING AS WELL AS POWERFUL TO DO THAT FOR HE ALWAYS HAS UNDER HIS BLOUSE A BRACE OF LOADED PISTOLS AND A DAGGER
AND I SAID HERE'S THE WIFE FOR ME
AND HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE OF THE LITTLE GREEN TABLES IN THE SECOND APARTMENT
VIVE LA CHARTE EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR IN THE FULL BURST OF HIS JOY
LET US TREAD LIKE CATS MY OLD DARLING THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
DRAW YOUR PINKING IRON THE BRIGAND DISAPPEARED WITHOUT ANY REPLY
ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION THE WIND HOWLED FIERCELY IN THE DARK AND DIRTY GULLIES OF THE CITE
LE BARON THOSE LITTLE HUMBLE NOTES COLLECTED BY ME WILL HAVE THEIR PART TO PLAY IN DIRECTING AND REGULATING THE AFFAIRS OF EUROPE YES YES RASCALS GENERALLY SEEK TO VEIL THEIR MEAN AND BASE PRACTICES BENEATH SOME HIGH-SOUNDING PRETEXT
THE SCHOOLMASTER WE HAVE HIM IN SAFETY SAID THE BLACK DOCTOR
THE SCHOOLMASTER CAME UP TO THE WINDOW AND SAID TO RODOLPH
RODOLPH ONCE MORE IS IT POSSIBLE BELIEVING ME LIKE YOURSELF YOU TOLD ME YOUR HISTORY NATURALLY AND WITHOUT CONCEALMENT WITHOUT WITHHOLDING EITHER WHAT WAS CULPABLE OR GENEROUS
WE MAY NOT WANT IT TO-DAY BUT ANOTHER TIME IT MAY BE USEFUL AND THE CHOUETTE GAVE THE BRIGAND A BIT OF YELLOW WAX ON WHICH THE PRINT OF THE LOCK WAS PERFECTLY IMPRESSED
THERE'S A LARGE HOLE CLOSE BY AND I HAVE A CAPITAL IDEA THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE THEN WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR
I SAID THOSE WHO WOULD BE LAMENTING YOUR ABSENCE MY DEAR CLEMENCE,--COME OWN THAT I DESERVE PRAISE FOR SO DISCREETLY FORMING MY SPEECH THE MARQUISE BLUSHED SLIGHTLY CAST DOWN HER EYES BUT SPOKE NOT
AND RODOLPH HAD AS WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED NUMEROUS REASONS FOR WISHING TO PRESERVE THE HONOUR AND PEACE OF ONE FOR WHOM HE FELT SO LIVELY AN INTEREST AS HE TOOK IN ALL CONCERNING M
HE WOULD GREATLY AMUSE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IF IT WERE NOT NECESSARY TO AVOID THEIR BEING KNOWN TO EACH OTHER IN THIS BUSINESS YOU CAN AUGMENT THE PAY OF M
IN HER APPEARANCE THERE WAS AS MUCH DECEIT AS IN HER MIND
ALLEE DES DES ACACIAS IN THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER INTERRUPTING HIM
YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE HORRIBLE TRICKS HE PLAYED OFF UPON ALL THE LODGERS AS WELL AS US
THE DAMP DARK STAIRCASE LOOKED STILL MORE GLOOMY THROUGH THE FOG OF A NOVEMBER DAY
THAT IS TO WEAR HIS CASSOCKS LESS THAN TWO OR THREE YEARS
I KEEP MY HISTORY TILL LAST AS A BONNE BOUCHE CHAPTER III
FOR I WILL DEFY THE MOST HYPOCHONDRIACAL PERSON IN EXISTENCE NOT TO BURST WITH LAUGHTER AT THE NARRATIVE AS WELL AS WITH CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE DESPATCHES OF THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE ASSUMED THEIR PRETENDED MISSIONS WITH SO SERIOUS AN AIR TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ATTACHED THE COLONEL AND THE COUNT TO HIS PRIVATE PERSON WHY MY DEAR FELLOW IS NOT COLONEL VERNER THE ACCURATE TYPE OF MILITARY PERFECTION
10 THESE BOXES WERE THE EXCLUSIVE MANUFACTURE OF THE CRIMINALS CONFINED EITHER IN THE GALLEYS OR PRISONS AND WHO SPENT NEARLY ALL THEIR SPARE HOURS IN MAKING THEM
NOTHING BUT THE DAMP WALLS MET HIS TOUCH HOWEVER AND IN UTTER DESPAIR HE RESUMED HIS POSITION AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS,--OF THE THIRTEEN STAIRS WHICH COMPOSED THE FLIGHT THREE WERE ALREADY UNDER WATER
CONTENTS
A MONTH AGO I LOOKED OVER THE PARAPET AT THE SEINE
RIGOLETTE BECAME WHAT YOU STYLE UPON PERFECTLY NEIGHBOURLY TERMS WITH HER OH BLESS YOU YES
DIDN'T YOU TWIG THE COVE IN THE GREEK CAP
BUT STILL IT DOES NOT ALTER MY FIRST OPINION
I WAS VERY YOUNG AND MY GUARDIAN SOLD THE STOCK
BUT THEY WERE NOT LONG COMING TO THE LAST FOR THEY NEVER HAD BUT TWO BUT SHE GAVE THEM NO FURTHER AID HELP THEM POOR CREATURES
I AM SURE RIGOLETTE WAS VERY WELL BEHAVED IN PRISON AND ALWAYS SO GAY AND SO INDUSTRIOUS SHE TOOK OUT WITH HER WHEN SHE LEFT THE PRISON AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED FRANCS THAT SHE HAD EARNED
BUT I WAS THINKING THE PORTER OF THIS HOUSE IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES IS PERHAPS A STOUT FELLOW
WHY DID YOU APPOINT TO MEET THE CHOURINEUR AT ST OUEN WHY YOU ARE NOT SO BRIGHT AS I TOOK YOU FOR
HE HAS HAD HOWEVER ONE LITTLE DISCUSSION WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT OF THE COUNTESS SARAH MACGREGOR HAS SHE THEN SEEN HER BY A MOST UNLUCKY CHANCE THE FATHER OF THE MARQUIS D'HARVILLE KNEW SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURG AND HER BROTHER TOM SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO DURING THEIR RESIDENCE IN PARIS AND WHEN THEY WERE MUCH NOTICED BY THE LADY OF THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR
WHEN I BEGAN TO SLAUGHTER THEM I DON'T KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME,--I WAS LIKE A FURY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PASTIQUE LA MAL_--WHAT DO YOU CALL IT PASTIQUER LA MALTOUZE HE SMUGGLES I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD CALL IT
OTHERS APPROACHED THE CHOURINEUR AND ASKED HIM IN A LOW VOICE FOR THE PARTICULARS OF THIS UNKNOWN WHO HAD MADE HIS ENTRANCE INTO THEIR WORLD IN SO STRIKING A MANNER
HE MUST HAVE GONE OUT WHILST MY BACK WAS TURNED SAYS BRAS ROUGE
ARE THEY NOT MY OLD PET A MELANCHOLY SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHICH PRODUCED A CORRESPONDING MOTION IN THE HUGE BLACK HAT WAS M
AND ON ITS SURFACE I SEE THE PALE GHASTLY FEATURES OF THOSE HE SHUDDERED AND SAID IN A LOW HOARSE VOICE CHOURINEUR DID I QUITE DO FOR THAT MAN LAST NIGHT NO SO MUCH THE BETTER OBSERVED THE ROBBER
IT IS SOME DISTANCE FROM HERE TO THE ALLEE DES VEUVES
HE NEVER ASKS THE NAMES OF HIS CUSTOMERS BUT STILL CALL HIM WHAT YOU LIKE,--PETER THOMAS CHRISTOPHER OR BARNABAS,--HE WILL ANSWER TO ANY AND ALL
AND I MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF IT FOR THE REASONS I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE DIGNIFIED AND FIRM TONE AND THE SERIOUS EXPRESSION OF THE FEATURES OF RODOLPH AT LENGTH CONVINCED THE CHOURINEUR
MADAME GEORGES THE CURE AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE FARM ONLY KNEW FLEUR-DE-MARIE'S PROTECTOR AS M
THEN UTTERING A FEARFUL CRY AS IF THE SPECTRE HAD TOUCHED HIM HE RUSHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BUTCHERY INTO THE DARKEST CORNER
MY POCKETBOOK CONTAINS PAPERS QUITE USELESS TO YOU
ORDINARY MEN THINK BUT OF IMPROVING THEIR CATTLE
RODOLPH IF YOU FORGET THE SERVICES YOU HAVE DONE TO ME I DO NOT
THE METISSES ONLY DIFFER FROM THE WHITES BY SOME PECULIARITIES HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE
I SHALL BE ABLE TO JUDGE THEN WHETHER THE INFORMATION YOU POSSESS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO CARRY THEM INTO EFFECT
D'HARVILLE MY LORD IMAGINED THAT IT WAS JUST PROBABLE THE MARQUIS HAD SOME PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES
YOUNG MAN,--YOUNG MAN YOU ARE VERY IMPRUDENT THE COACH WAS ALREADY IN MOTION
HE WAS IN AN AGONY OF FEAR
BUT WHAT'S THAT TO YOU MY LAD
THEY CAME FROM BRAS ROUGE'S
AND THE STRONGEST CHAINS MAY BE BROKEN THE THICKEST WALL PIERCED THROUGH,--STEEP RAMPARTS HAVE BEEN SCALED BEFORE NOW,--AND YOU MIGHT ONE DAY BURST YOUR YOKE AND BE AGAIN LET LOOSE UPON SOCIETY LIKE AN INFURIATED BEAST MARKING YOUR PASSAGE WITH MURDER AND DESTRUCTION
A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARDS AND THE OGRESS HERSELF PLACED ON THE TABLE A PITCHER OF WINE BREAD AND A HARLEQUIN OF WHICH WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO GIVE AN IDEA TO THE READER BUT WHICH APPEARED MOST RELISHING TO THE CHOURINEUR
BUT I HAVE TOO OFTEN DREAMED OF THE SERGEANT ADDED HE IN A HOARSE TONE
TOM AND SARAH
I HAD MY LITTLE EXCURSIONS WITH A FRIEND WHO WAS IN PRISON WITH ME,--A GOOD LITTLE GIRL AS CAN BE
STAY WHERE YOU ARE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER TO THE CHOUETTE
FOR IT IS RELATED OF HIM THAT HE SAID WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GOOD SENSE AND WITH A KIND OF BITTER GRIEF WHAT THE DEVIL
OH MON DIEU NO
THE CREOLE HAD THE COOL IMPUDENCE TO TELL HIM THAT IT WAS A BAD EXAMPLE TO SEE A MASTER CONCEDE TO A SLAVE AND THAT HE WOULD NOT SET THAT EXAMPLE TO SATISFY A CAPRICE OF DAVID'S
I REMAINED ON THE BRIDGE TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK MY STOCK OF BARLEY-SUGAR HANGING ROUND MY NECK AND OFTEN CRYING HEARTILY
IT IS A TALISMAN AND BRINGS GOOD LUCK A TALISMAN SAID RODOLPH IN A CARELESS TONE
BESIDE THE ENTRANCE TO OUR ALLEY THERE WAS A DRAM-SHOP AND THERE THE CHOUETTE WENT IN STILL DRAGGING ME BY THE HAND
NOW LET US HAVE A LITTLE TALK ABOUT HIM
ON THE OTHER HAND BY LENDING HIMSELF TO THIS MATCH POLIDORI BOUND RODOLPH AND SARAH TO HIM BY A TIE OF THE STRONGEST GRATITUDE OR AT LEAST BY THE COMPLICITY OF A DANGEROUS ACT
THESE ARE A SWELL LOT WHO WANT TO BE REVENGED ON AN ENEMY AND THAT ENEMY IS THE BEGGAR THAT YOU WISHED TO FLOOR LET'S GO AND MEET HIM
AND THAT MADE ME REJOICE IN USING IT
BUT THEN SUPPOSE THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER ARRIVES IN THE MEANTIME,--THAT'S TO BE THOUGHT OF
DURING THESE SORROWFUL REFLECTIONS THE WATER WAS STILL RISING RAPIDLY AND FIVE STEPS ONLY NOW REMAINED DRY
THE SCHOOLMASTER'S COUNTENANCE WAS GHASTLY
AT LENGTH RODOLPH LOOKED UP AND MEETING HER MOURNFUL LOOK SMILED KINDLY ON HER AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF MY CHILD
RIGOLETTE DEPRIVES HERSELF OF HER NIGHT'S REST AND SITS UP POOR GIRL THOUGH IT BURNS HER CANDLES CONTRIVING OUT OF ONE BIT AND THE OTHER OF HER CUTTING OUT TO MAKE UP A FEW CLOTHES FOR THE CHILDREN
AND I SLASHED AND SLASHED AND SLASHED UNTIL MY KNIFE FELL FROM MY HANDS
WE WILL NOT SET OUT ON OUR VISIT UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK HERE IS THE CHOUETTE SAID BRAS ROUGE HEARING AND REPLYING TO A WARNING CRY SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD UTTERED BEFORE HE DESCENDED TO THE SUBTERRANEOUS ABODE
CESAR BRADAMANTI OPERATING DENTIST EVIDENTLY DISGUISED THE SUPERSCRIPTION WAS ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF CAPITAL LETTERS
THE KNIFE
IT IS DEVILISH WONDERFUL WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE SAID RODOLPH GREATLY SURPRISED
RODOLPH THAT THE CHOURINEUR HAS EDIFIED ME ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY EDIFIED YOU YOU ARE RIGHT,--THE LANGUAGE IS A LITTLE TOO REFINED FOR YOU
THE GOOD ABBE WAS SO OLD SO VERY OLD THAT HIS HANDS TREMBLED CONTINUALLY AND WHEN HE OCCASIONALLY LIFTED THEM UP WHEN SPEAKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS GIVING A BENEDICTION
THE DOCTOR INSTANTLY LAID HIS PLAN TO DIRECT AND SECURE THIS INFLUENCE AND TO MAKE IT SERVE ALSO AS THE MEANS OF DESTROYING MURPHY'S POWER AND REPUTATION
TAKE IT TONNERRE M
GRASS
IN THE SERIOUS AND RESIGNED COUNTENANCE OF MADAME GEORGES MIGHT EASILY BE TRACED THE INDELIBLE MARKS OF LONG-SUFFERING
AT LEAST FOR PITY'S SAKE SPARE MY LIFE WILL YOU TELL ME WHERE YOUR SON IS YES YES I WILL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW WILL YOU TELL ME WHO ARE THE PARENTS OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHOSE CHILDHOOD THE CHOUETTE MADE ONE SCENE OF TORTURE IN MY POCKETBOOK THERE ARE PAPERS WHICH WILL PUT YOU ON THE TRACK OF THE PERSONS WHO GAVE HER TO THE CHOUETTE WHERE IS YOUR SON WILL YOU LET ME LIVE FIRST MAKE A FULL CONFESSION AND THEN WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH HESITATION
THE GRAND DUCHESS WHO HOWEVER WOULD NOT BE CONVINCED IN SPITE OF HER EYESIGHT SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO SARAH
AT THE MOMENT OF RODOLPH'S APPEARANCE IN THE YARD MURPHY WAS IN THE ACT OF DEPOSITING IN THE POCKET OF A SMALL TRAVELLING CALECHE A PAIR OF SMALL PISTOLS HE HAD JUST BEEN CAREFULLY CLEANING
AN HONEST MAN I WAS FAMISHING
THE UNKNOWN THREW HIM TWICE WITH IMMENSE DEXTERITY BY WHAT IS CALLED IN WRESTLING THE LEG-PASS OR CROOK
BUT WHERE DO YOU COME FROM
HIS HAIR EYEBROWS AND EYES WERE OF A DEEP BLACK WHICH SHOWED OFF THE MORE FULLY THE PURE WHITENESS OF HIS FACE
RODOLPH I DARE TO PRAY SAID GOUALEUSE
THEY SAY HE IS HONEST AND FAITHFUL AND YOU MAY RETAIN HIM THERE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE
YOU'LL TAKE A GLASS OF BEER,--OR BRANDY PERHAPS,--WHILST WE WAIT FOR FINETTE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
IF THE THING WERE FOUND OUT TO-MORROW WE MIGHT BE TRACED AND DISCOVERED
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HOPED TOO THAT THE OPPORTUNITY NOW BEFORE HIM OF VISITING THESE ABODES OF VICE AND WRETCHEDNESS MIGHT AFFORD HIM THE MEANS OF RESCUING SOME UNFORTUNATE BEING FROM THE DEPTHS OF GUILT AND MISERY
HE SAYS HE MUST AND HE WILL HAVE IT AS PIPELET UTTERED THE LAST WORDS HE GAVE HIS HEAD A MOURNFUL SHAKE AND FOLDING HIS ARMS ASSUMED AN ATTITUDE OF MARTYRLIKE RESOLUTION
BESIDES IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I WERE AFRAID OF HIM BUT HOW IS IT THAT THE POLICE DO NOT DETECT HIM
THESE PAINFUL SUGGESTIONS CROWDED ON RODOLPH'S MIND BUT ALTHOUGH WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE VARIOUS GUESTS RECEIVED BY THE MARQUISE HE COULD RECOLLECT NO ONE ANSWERING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMANDANT
CHAPTER XVI
THE REST OF THE GROUND WAS CONCEALED UNDER A MASS OF TRELLIS-WORK WHICH SHELTERED TWO ROWS OF CLUMSY TABLES FASTENED TO THE GROUND
HE HAD A NOSE LIKE A PARROT AND NOW IT IS AS FLAT AS IN A DEATH'S HEAD
YOU KNOW THAT SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IN PARIS HIS FRIENDS HAVE BECOME USED TO SEE HIM BUT LITTLE IN PUBLIC
THERE IS ONLY THAT ONE ENTRANCE TO NO
THE SICK-NURSE 172 XVII
THE NIGHT WAS PITCH DARK AND THE CHOURINEUR THAT HE MIGHT KNOW THE NEXT DAY THE PLACE WHERE HE THEN WAS DREW FROM HIS POCKET HIS CLASP-KNIFE AND CUT A DEEP NOTCH IN ONE OF THE TREES AT THE CORNER OF THE ENTRANCE AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS RESTING-PLACE WHICH WAS AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE
THIS I DID
CONFOUND IT
IT ARISES OUT OF THE TWO ROOMS JOINING ONE ANOTHER SO CLOSELY,--NATURALLY THAT BRINGS ABOUT A LITTLE FLIRTATION BUT NOTHING MORE SO THEN IT BECOMES A MATTER OF COURSE DOES IT SAID RODOLPH THAT EVERY ONE WHO OCCUPIES THE APARTMENT I AM TO HAVE SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO MLLE
ARE YOU GROWING STEADY STEADY AS A STONE FIGURE
I LOST A DEAR CHILD WHO IF LIVING WOULD NOW BE ABOUT YOUR AGE
LET THE SERVANT COME AND WE CAN PAY HIM AND DESIRE HIM TO FETCH US A COACH REPLIED RODOLPH
CAN YOU BE SO GENEROUS AS TO FORGIVE I BOTH JUDGE YOU AND AWARD YOUR SENTENCE CRIED RODOLPH IN A SOLEMN TONE
TALKING OF COMFORTABLE I AM THE MAN THAT WILL BE SO M
WHY THIS IT IS
ALFRED WHO ADHERED TO THIS UPPER ORNAMENT AS TENACIOUSLY AS HIS WIFE DID TO HER BRUTUS WIG WAS FURTHER ATTIRED IN AN ANCIENT GREEN COAT WITH IMMENSE FLAPS TURNED UP WITH GREASE,--IF SO MIGHT BE DESCRIBED THE BRIGHT AND SHINY PATCHES OF LONG-ACCUMULATED DIRT WHICH HAD GIVEN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT HUE TO SOME PORTIONS OF THE GARMENT
RODOLPH LET US TRY
MY GOOD DAYS ARE WORTH THREE FRANCS SOMETIMES FOUR IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG AND YOU ARE IDLE SOMETIMES YOU RASCAL YES AS LONG AS I HAVE MONEY THOUGH I DO NOT WASTE IT
HE LIES DOUBTLESS WOUNDED PAST ALL HOPE
BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN IN WHAT A HORRIBLE STATE WE FOUND THIS UNFORTUNATE AND HALF-DEAD COUPLE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE SACRILEGIOUS DEFIANCE ALMOST CAST IN THE FACE OF THE ALMIGHTY BY THIS MAN DRUNK WITH WINE AND FEROCITY YOU WOULD COMPREHEND HOW MONSEIGNEUR DESIRED AS HE SAID ON THIS OCCASION TO ACT AS IT WERE IN BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE ALL THIS IS AS ASSAILABLE AND AS JUSTIFIABLE AS THE PUNISHMENT OF THE SCHOOLMASTER MY WORTHY SQUIRE
IT IS BETTER TO HAVE A BELLYFUL OF VICTUALS EVERY DAY THAN TO STARVE WITH HUNGER
BUT THAT IS ON CONDITION THAT YOU TEACH ME HOW TO GIVE THOSE PRECIOUS THUMPS WHICH SETTLED MY BUSINESS SO QUICKLY
EXCELLENT MAN
GOOD PRECAUTION,--FOOTSTEPS OR BROKEN GLASS CANNOT BE HEARD IF WE MUST MILL THE GLAZE BREAK A PANE OF GLASS
BUT HOW SHALL I VENTURE BEFORE THE GOOD PERSON YOU MENTIONED AS LIVING HERE
TELL HIM YOU KNOW OF A CAPITAL PUT-UP THAT YOU HAVE REFUSED TO JOIN IT BUT THAT IF HE WILL TAKE YOUR PLACE HE HAS ONLY TO BE TO-MORROW THAT'S TO-DAY AT THE BARRIER OF BERCY AT THE PANIER-FLEURI AND THERE HE WILL SEE THE MAN WHO HAS MADE THE PLANT QUI A NOURRI LE POUPARD WELL ON LEAVING YOU I PUSHED ON BRISKLY FOR THE CITE
THIS LEISURE YOU SHALL HAVE
BULL-DOG 1 AND BULLDOG 2 PROTEGE 1 PROTEGEE 8 AND PROTEGES 1 RENCONTRE 2 AND RENCOUNTER 1 SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURG 1 AND SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURY 1 WORDS USING THE OE LIGATURE WHICH HAVE BEEN HEREIN REPRESENTED AS OE
RIGOLETTE'S SHE IS NEVER WITHOUT IT
LET ME CONCLUDE MY REPORT
CABRION ETCHING BY MERCIER AFTER THE DRAWING BY FRANK T
BUT IT IS LONG SINCE HE HAS SCRAPED OUT FROM HIS PHIZ WHAT NATURE HAD PLACED THERE
THE POOR GIRL OVERCOMING HER DISGUST BENT HER FOREHEAD TO THE OGRESS BUT RODOLPH GIVING A SUDDEN PUSH WITH HIS ELBOW SHOVED THE HAG BACK ON HER SEAT TOOK FLEUR-DE-MARIE'S ARM AND LEFT THE TAPIS-FRANC AMIDST THE LOUD MALEDICTIONS OF MOTHER PONISSE
IS IT NOT IT IS INDEED
FOR NONE WOULD BE SAFE FROM YOUR HERCULEAN STRENGTH OR FROM THE SHARPNESS OF YOUR KNIFE
AND YOUR IDEA OF SAVING TOO IS A REMARKABLY GOOD ONE
YOU SHALL DRINK AS DEEP OF THE SHAME OF THE SON AS YOU HAVE OF THE DISGRACE OF THE FATHER THIS ATROCITY IS MOST INEXPLICABLE
EIGHT PEOPLE ONLY TO BE FOUND IN BREAD THAT IS WHAT I SAY,--JUST IMAGINE HOW HARD IT MUST BE TO KEEP LIFE AND SOUL TOGETHER UPON SUCH SMALL MEANS
BUT--BUT--YOU GIVE ME YOUR ARM WELL AND WHAT OF THAT YOU ARE A WORKMAN AND SOME ONE MAY TELL YOUR MASTER THAT THEY MET YOU WITH ME AND HARM MAY COME OF IT
WHAT A CAPITAL PLOUGH THEY HAVE GOT DRAWN BY THOSE TWO FINE GRAY HORSES
THEY WERE RATS DRIVEN BY THE FAST-RISING WATER FROM THEIR RETREATS
AND BRING A WELL-SHARPENED KNIFE NOT TOO THIN IN THE BLADE AND STRONG IN THE BACK I HAVE JUST WHAT YOU WANT MASTER
BUT SERIOUSLY NOW MY DEAR DE GRAUEN HOW HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT I ONLY ALLOW SUCH FELLOWS AS D'HARNEIM AND HIS TRAIN TO FLATTER FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY KNOW NOT HOW TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
BY RENTING THE CHAMBER LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE YOUNG MAN RODOLPH BESIDES BEING ON THE SPOT TO FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES CONSIDERED HE SHOULD ALSO BE ENABLED TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS INHABITING THE REST OF THE HOUSE
IT IS IN HIS CASE JUSTICE HE WILL HAVE BEFORE HIM AN UNLIMITED HORIZON FOR EXPIATION ADDED RODOLPH
THE CHOUETTE IS QUITE SAFE JUST NOW
IT MAKES ONE QUITE LONG TO BE THERE THREE OR FOUR FINE COWS ARE GRAZING IN THE MEADOW WHICH IS ONLY SEPARATED FROM THE GARDEN BY A HEDGE OF HONEYSUCKLE AND FROM MY WINDOWS I CAN SEE THE COWS PERFECTLY AND ONE AMONG THEM OUGHT TO BE MY FAVOURITE YOU KNOW M
IT HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN DROPPED BY THE PERSON WHO HAD JUST QUITTED POLIDORI
I SAY AGAIN IS HE NOT A LUCKY FELLOW HE IS INDEED M
NOW TELL ME HAVE YOU BEEN EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE INFORMATION COLLECTED TOUCHING THE SON OF THE SCHOOLMASTER PERHAPS AS REGARDS HIM I AM NOT FURNISHED WITH SUCH MINUTE PARTICULARS
AND AS THE CHOUETTE GOT IN A PASSION WHEN I DID NOT CRY WHY I TO BE REVENGED UPON HER THE MORE SHE THUMPED ME THE MORE I LAUGHED ALTHOUGH THE TEARS CAME INTO MY EYES WITH THE PAIN BUT POOR GOUALEUSE DID NOT THE STICKS OF BARLEY-SUGAR MAKE YOU LONG FOR THEM AH YES CHOURINEUR
IT WAS TO THIS FETE THAT WE SHALL FOLLOW HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE REIGNING GRAND DUKE OF GEROLSTEIN GUSTAVUS RODOLPH TRAVELLING IN FRANCE UNDER THE NAME OF THE COUNT DE DUREN
AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE RETAINED A MOST LIVELY RECOLLECTION OF THIS HAPPY PERIOD OF THEIR YOUTH
DE LUCENAY IS A NUISANCE TO EVERYBODY
THE CAVE WAS FILLING WITH WATER ARISING FROM THE FEARFUL AND FORMIDABLE OVERFLOWING OF THE SEINE,--THE DUNGEON IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN THROWN WAS DOUBTLESS BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE RIVER AND WAS CHOSEN BY HIS GAOLERS FOR THAT PURPOSE AS OFFERING A SLOW THOUGH CERTAIN MEANS OF DESTRUCTION
IF HE RESISTS YOU HAVE ONLY YOUR PISTOL WHICH IS A NOISY WEAPON WHILST A TOOL LIKE THIS AND HE SHOWED RODOLPH THE HANDLE OF HIS PONIARD MAKES NO NOISE AND DOES NOT DISTURB ANYBODY DO YOU MEAN THEN TO ASSASSINATE HIM EXCLAIMED RODOLPH
BUT WHEN YOU SEE HER COME CLOSE TO YOU GET OUT OF THIS HOLE AND TWIST HER NECK NO DEFER THAT FOR A TIME
DAVID REPLIED WITH A FEW BITTER AND VIOLENT WORDS
NOT RAIN REPLIED THE SCHOOLMASTER
THE PLANTER WAS CARRIED TO HIS BED IN A STATE OF THE HIGHEST FEVER
CESAR BRADAMANTI AH
THE TAPIS-FRANC.[1 IT WAS ON A COLD AND RAINY NIGHT TOWARDS THE END OF OCTOBER 1838 THAT A TALL AND POWERFUL MAN WITH AN OLD BROAD-BRIMMED STRAW HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND CLAD IN A BLUE COTTON CARTER'S FROCK WHICH HUNG LOOSELY OVER TROUSERS OF THE SAME MATERIAL CROSSED THE PONT AU CHANGE AND DARTED WITH A HASTY STEP INTO THE CITE THAT LABYRINTH OF OBSCURE NARROW AND WINDING STREETS WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE TO NOTRE DAME
IN SPITE OF THE MONOTONY OF THE LANDSCAPE FLEUR-DE-MARIE WAS SO DELIGHTED AT SEEING THE FIELDS AS SHE CALLED THEM THAT FORGETTING THE SAD THOUGHTS WHICH THE RECOLLECTION OF THE CHOUETTE HAD AWAKENED IN HER HER LOVELY COUNTENANCE GREW RADIANT WITH DELIGHT
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO-NIGHT WITH THE GROS-BOITEUX AND THE SCHOOLMASTER REPLIED THE FELLOW
THE PROPOSAL WHICH SARAH MADE TO THE BRIGAND RESPECTING RODOLPH DEEPLY INTERESTED THE CHOURINEUR WHO ALARMED FOR THE PERILS WHICH APPEARED ABOUT TO BESET HIS NEW FRIEND REGRETTED THAT HE COULD NOT WARN HIM OF THEM
FOR A TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT AT THE END OF A FEW MOMENTS THE DISTANT NOISE OF A DOOR SHUTTING WHICH CREAKED ON ITS RUSTY HINGES SOUNDED HARSHLY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CAVERN
I WAS TALL AND STRONG AND SO I ENLISTED IN A REGIMENT
THEY ARE THE PLAGUE--THE RUIN--THE DESTRUCTION OF A HOUSE YOU HAVE THEN HAD A PAINTER LODGING WITH YOU I PRESUME UNHAPPILY SIR I DID HAVE ONE REPLIED M
OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE LET US TAKE OFF OUR SHOES AND THEN THEY WON'T HEAR US AS WE FOLLOW SUGGESTED THE CHOUETTE
RODOLPH DID NOT TELL ME TO DO SO AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD NO FURTHER OCCASION FOR ME BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST DESIRE TO EXPRESS HIS GRATITUDE TO YOU DID YOU NOT TELL ME THAT M
AT THIS MOMENT I MET THE OGRESS AND ONE OF HER OLD WOMEN WHO KNEW WHERE I LODGED AND WAS ALWAYS COMING ABOUT ME SINCE I LEFT PRISON
WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO TALK OF AND SO LEAVE OFF YOUR GOSSIP MAY WE PATTER BEFORE THE MOT ASKED RODOLPH
AS FOR MADAME PIPELET SINCE SHE HAD BEGUN EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE POOR SUFFERERS IN THE ATTICS HER COUNTENANCE HAD CEASED TO STRIKE RODOLPH AS REPULSIVE AND HE EVEN THOUGHT IT WORE AN AGREEABLE EXPRESSION
AND HE REALLY IS A FINE EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN HANDSOME AS AN ANGEL AND AS GOOD AS GOLD THE FACT IS MY DEAR MURPHY THAT IF THE YOUNG PRINCE HENRY HAD HAD HIS ENTREE TO THE GRAND DUCAL ABBEY OF STE
WHEN THAT IS DONE WE WILL RETURN AND PLAY A HAND AT PIQUET AND HAVE A BIT OF SOMETHING IN A PLACE IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES THAT I KNOW NEAR THE RIVER
ANOTHER IMAGINES HIS EYE IN A FINE FRENZY ROLLING MARKS HIM OUT AS A POET
THE COMMANDANT ARRIVED MORE STUCK UP WITH PRIDE THAN EVER
CABRION YES YES SIR
IT WAS AS DARK AS THE DEVIL
OF COURSE BECAUSE SHE HAD BUT ONE
WE SHALL CALL THIS INDIVIDUAL THOMAS SEYTON
THOUGH ALL BUT KING HE HAS LOST NONE OF THE WINNING SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY OF HIS MANNER AND SPITE OF MY REPUBLICANISM I MUST CONFESS I HAVE SELDOM IF EVER KNOWN SO IRRESISTIBLE A PERSON SARAH THREW A SIDE GLANCE OF DEEP AND SCRUTINISING HATRED UPON HER UNCONSCIOUS RIVAL BUT QUICKLY RECOVERING HERSELF SHE SAID GAILY
IT FOLLOWS AS A MATTER OF COURSE WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
BRAS ROUGE--YOUR GREAT MAN HERE--ABOUT RENTING THIS APARTMENT NONE WHATEVER SIR
THE PRIVATE SECRETARY I AWAIT YOUR LEISURE REPLIED M
SHE WOULD SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE CHILD I HAVE LOST AND MUST FOR EVER BEWAIL LET US STILL HOPE FOR YOU AND FOR HER AT THE MOMENT WHEN RODOLPH AND MADAME GEORGES APPROACHED THE FARM MURPHY AND MARIE ALSO ENTERED
WELL DONE UPON MY WORD
IT IS A HEAVY DEBT BUT BE ASSURED I WILL PAY IT
I FOUND YOU IN THE PASSAGE OF BRAS ROUGE
I OUGHT TO HAVE GONE TO THE RIGHT WHEN I LEFT THE TAVERN
AN IMAGINATIVE MIND MIGHT EASILY HAVE PERSUADED HIMSELF HE STOOD NEAR A HUGE WINDOW OPENING ON SOME BEAUTIFUL ASIATIC LANDSCAPE DURING THE TRANQUILLITY OF A SUMMER'S TWILIGHT
LAST NIGHT ONLY AFTER HAVING ROBBED A MAN AND WOMAN IN THE CITE YOU OFFERED TO KILL ME FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS I HEARD HIM SAID THE CHOURINEUR
NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT THEN WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF WHY I MAINTAIN MY LORD THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU TO THROW YOURSELF IN THE WAY OF ALL THESE BLACKGUARDS
POOR LITTLE MOUSE WHAT A FRIGHT YOU WERE IN WHEN THE CHOUETTE SAW YOU!--EH HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF THAT AFFAIR POOR GOUALEUSE ASKED RODOLPH WITH AS MUCH INTEREST AS THE CHOURINEUR
NEXT DAY THE ONE-EYED WOMAN GAVE ME A SIMILAR ALLOWANCE FOR BREAKFAST AS FOR SUPPER AND SENT ME TO MONTFAUCON TO GET SOME WORMS TO BAIT FOR FISH
AND FINALLY LA CHOUETTE HAVING LATELY QUITTED THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SINCE THE AFFAIR IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES HAD REAPPEARED ON THE STAGE AND WAS EVIDENTLY ENGAGED IN SOME UNDERHAND PROCEEDINGS WITH THE FORTUNE-TELLER AND FEMALE MONEY-LENDER WHO OCCUPIED THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOUSE
HOW CAN YOU BE GOOD NEIGHBOURS WITHOUT IT,--DON'T YOU SEE
HOWEVER HAPPILY M
NOT HE
NOT HE
LORD BLESS ME WHAT A FRIGHT I HAVE HAD
NO ONE HAD HIS KNIFE SO SHARPENED AND KEEN-EDGED AS MINE
MY LORD IT WOULD DRIVE ME MAD AND THE POOR FELLOW HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS WITH A CONVULSIVE START
MURPHY,--MIND YOUR EYE
MAY I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF ASKING WHETHER HE IS EXPECTED IN SHORTLY I AM NOT SPEAKING OF MY SON BUT MY HUSBAND
COME NO AIRS AND GRACES
HAPPILY FOR BOTH YOU ARE NO THIEF CHOURINEUR
HIS COUNTENANCE THOUGH SOMEWHAT PHLEGMATIC WAS EXPRESSIVE OF GREAT RESOLUTION AND KINDLINESS OF NATURE
RODOLPH JUST LOOK AT MY EYES,--THEY DO NOT SHOW THAT I HAVE BEEN CRYING DO THEY AND HERE FLEUR-DE-MARIE HAVING REPEATEDLY CLOSED HER EYES TO GET RID OF THE REBELLIOUS TEARS THAT WOULD GATHER THERE OPENED THEM FULL UPON RODOLPH WITH A LOOK OF MOST ENCHANTING CANDOUR AND SWEETNESS
YOU HAVE KILLED HIM NO NO
FOR THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS COMPANION WHILE GAZING UPON THE FAIR CALM SCENE BEFORE HER WAS LIT UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE PUREST JOY
THIS PERSONAGE WHOM RODOLPH HAD BEEN TO SEE IN THE CITE AND WHOM HE DID NOT YET KNOW UNDER HIS TRUE NAME OR RATHER HIS HABITUAL SURNAME WAS BRAS ROUGE
HE FELT HE WAS ON HIS OWN SOIL
RODOLPH INDEED I DO NOT MIND IT AT ALL
WHAT MAKES YOU SO LATE SPITE OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE THOUGHTS CROWDING UPON HIS MIND RODOLPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN A SMILE AS HE SURVEYED THE GROTESQUE PERIWIG AND HIDEOUSLY WRINKLED CARBUNCLED VISAGE OF THE HEROINE OF THIS COMIC SCENE
AMONG THE VARIOUS CANDIDATES FOR THE HAND OF THE YOUNG HEIRESS WAS THIS DURESNEL THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A WEALTHY AND RESPECTABLE FAMILY POSSESSING POWERFUL PARLIAMENTARY INFLUENCE AND CONCEALING THE DEPRAVITY OF HIS DISPOSITION BENEATH THE MOST SPECIOUS EXTERIOR
THE MAN WITH THE GREEK SKULL-CAP SHRIEKED WITH RAGE AND HALF EXTENDED ON A TABLE STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY THAT THREE MEN COULD SCARCELY HOLD HIM
PERHAPS HE MAY BE TAKING OUT SEVERAL,--AND IT IS PAINFUL THIS EXPLANATION THOUGH A PROBABLE ONE DID NOT SATISFY RODOLPH AS TO THE HORRID SCREAM WHICH STILL RESOUNDED IN HIS EARS
PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT MIND JUST LOOKING OVER THIS FOR ME WITH THE UTMOST PLEASURE QUICKLY REPLIED RODOLPH CURIOUS TO DIVE INTO THE MYSTERIES OF WHO MADAME PIPELET'S CORRESPONDENT MIGHT BE
IT IS RAINING AGAIN IN TORRENTS
THE VERY SAME
AND AS FOR THE TWIST OF THE CHAIN ROUND MY NECK WHY THAT ONLY GAVE ME A NATURAL CRAVAT OF A BLUE COLOUR
THE NEGRO PLACED A SMALL POCKETBOOK IN THE TREMBLING HANDS OF THE SCHOOLMASTER
THE WORD MONSEIGNEUR SPOKEN IRONICALLY BY THE CHOURINEUR CAUSED AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE ON THE LIPS OF RODOLPH WHO REPLIED OH I LIKE TO BE CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE HERE'S A PEER OF THE REALM FOR YOU
THIS WAY SHE SAID
ONLY LOOK AT THE GOLD-COLOURED CLOUDS OUT THERE--THERE I MEAN
BY ALL MEANS
HAVE YOU NEVER MY LITTLE FLEUR-DE-MARIE AMUSED YOURSELF WITH BUILDING SIMILAR CASTLES IN THE AIR YES FORMERLY WHEN I WAS IN PRISON BEFORE I WENT TO LIVE WITH THE OGRESS,--THEN I USED TO DO NOTHING ALL DAY BUT DANCE SING AND BUILD THESE FAIRY DREAMS
WHAT AN OVER-NICE PERSON YOU ARE TO TALK OF A LITTLE INNOCENT FLIRTATION BEING RUINOUS AND THAT TOO WITH A MAN SO SCRUPULOUSLY GUARDED AS TO ABSTAIN FROM EVER APPEARING IN YOUR HUSBAND'S PRESENCE FOR FEAR OF COMPROMISING YOU
SOMETIMES THE CURE OR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER IS INVITED TO SHARE THE MEAL
SHE DESERVES THIS KIND INTEREST AND ALWAYS WILL DESERVE IT M
YOUR PARDON COUNT REPLIED RODOLPH IF I DIFFER WITH YOU IN OPINION
I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO OFFEND
THE RAIN HAVING CEASED FOR THE MOMENT RODOLPH OVERCOMING A SENSATION OF DISGUST WENT TO MEET THE FRIGHTFUL PAIR
THE PROPHECY HAD BEEN SO OFTEN REPEATED THAT THE YOUNG SCOTCH GIRL EVENTUALLY FULLY CREDITED ITS FULFILMENT
I DARE SAY THOUGH HE WILL SOON BE UP AGAIN WELL AND STRONG AS EVER
NOR IS THIS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF THE INTEREST OUR NOBLE MASTER TAKES IN EVERY MATTER CONCERNING THE HOUSE OF D'HARVILLE
BUT I AGAIN REPEAT THIS HOUSE AND THIS MONEY ARE YOURS,--THEY ARE YOUR PROPERTY THE CHOURINEUR BECAME PURPLE PASSED HIS HORNY HAND OVER HIS BROW WHICH WAS BATHED WITH PERSPIRATION AND STAMMERED OUT IN A FALTERING VOICE
THIS E-TEXT WAS PREPARED FROM NUMBERED EDITION 505 OF THE 1000 PRINTED
HE REMEMBERED THE COUNTERFEITED WRITING AND THE COARSE COMMON PAPER STAINED WITH TEARS WHICH HAD WELL-NIGH OBLITERATED PART OF THE ADDRESS,--TOO WELL DID HE SEE IN THE MYSTERIOUS GRIEF-STAINED EPISTLE THE OPENING OF A DRAMA OF DEEP AND FEARFUL IMPORT
NO DOUBT ALL MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND THE DOCTOR EXPOSED TO THE ANGER OF THE GRAND DUKE BUT THEN THE MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED THE UNION LEGAL
HE WAS HARDLY EIGHTEEN WHEN TOM AND SARAH WERE PRESENTED TO HIS FATHER
DE GRAUEN THEN READ AS FOLLOWS
THIS MAN PRESENTED IN FACT THE EXAGGERATION OF WHAT THERE IS OF SHORT THICKSET AND CONDENSED IN THE TYPE OF THE HERCULES FARNESE
WHAT YOU WERE TRYING YOUR FRIENDS WERE YOU THAT CAN'T ASTONISH YOU WHO SLEEP WITH YOUR EYES OPEN I WHO--THAT'S DIFFERENT YOUNG MAN
THE CHOURINEUR WHO HAD RESPECTFULLY LEFT HIS NAILED SHOES AT THE DOOR AT THESE WORDS AROSE AND WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE INDICATED BY THE NEGRO'S FINGER
QUICK
HERE AND THERE A DIAMOND SPARKLED AMONG THE WAXY PETALS AS IF A DEWDROP FRESH FROM ITS NATIVE SKIES HAD FALLEN THERE
I WILL TRY AND HOLD HIM M
RODOLPH WE WILL GO INTO THE PANIER-FLEURI,--NEITHER MYSELF NOR MADAME HAS BREAKFASTED,--AND WE WILL TALK OVER OUR LITTLE MATTERS WHILST WE ARE TAKING A CRUST MOST WILLINGLY WE CAN TALK AS WE GO ON
YOU HAVE DEGRADED THE INTELLIGENCE PLACED WITHIN YOU BY A SUPREME POWER,--YOU HAVE REDUCED IT TO THE BRUTAL INSTINCTS OF RAPINE AND MURDER
BUT IS IT NOT TO HONOUR GOD IN THE MOST ACCEPTABLE WAY TO RAISE FROM THE DUST ONE OF THOSE BEINGS OF THE FINEST MOULD WHOM HE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO ENDOW RICHLY
WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO ASK YOUR NAME POMONA FORTUNATA ANASTASIA PIPELET WELL THEN MADAME PIPELET HAVING AGREED AS TO YOUR OWN TERMS WILL YOU BE PLEASED TO TELL ME THOSE FOR THE APARTMENT I WISH TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADJOINING SMALL CLOSET ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS A MONTH,--NOT A FARTHING LESS
AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD
HEADED BY YOUR COURAGE THIS BAND MAY BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN PROTECTING THE PROPERTIES WHICH ARE THROUGHOUT THE PLAIN
HIS SON
THE CRY THE LOOK THE BLOOD THAT SPOUTED OUT MADE A FEARFUL IMPRESSION ON THE MAN
TORTILLARD
WHY POOR LOUISE DAUGHTER TO OUR SICK LODGER HAS BEEN HIS ONLY SERVANT FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS
AND IF HER NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOUR WILL MAKE LOVE TO HER THAT IS NOT HER FAULT
SHE THEN RECOMMENDED TO RODOLPH THE MOST PROFOUND DISCRETION FOR FEAR OF AROUSING THE GRAND DUKE'S SUSPICIONS AS HE WOULD BE INEXORABLE AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ONLY HAPPINESS,--THAT OF SEEING EACH OTHER EVERY DAY
AND NOW THE MATTER WAS CLEAR TO HIM
YOU HAVE BEEN TO A WEDDING BREAKFAST SOMEWHERE THIS MORNING NO MORE THAN ON OTHER MORNINGS
NOW I KNOW WHAT MAKES YOU SO EXPERT AT DESCRIBING IT SAID LA GOUALEUSE LAUGHING MERRILY AT HER OWN LITTLE JEST
TO BE SURE THE DENTIST ON THE THIRD FLOOR
THE CHARCOAL-DEALER DID NOT LEAVE THE DOOR OF THE CABARET BUT LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND GAZED FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH A SMALL HOLE WHICH HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY MADE IN THE THICK COAT OF WHITENING WITH WHICH THE WINDOWS OF SUCH HAUNTS AS THESE ARE USUALLY COVERED ON THE INSIDE
RODOLPH WAS THEN IN HIS THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR IN THE VERY PRIME AND PERFECTION OF MANLY HEALTH AND STRENGTH
ALWAYS SO VERY SAD YES
HALF MAN HALF FROG
IT QUITE SHOOK ME THAT AFFAIR DID
THE WALK
AND THUS NOTHING IS MORE WORTHY OF COMPASSION AND RESPECT THAN A WOMAN LIKE MADAME GEORGES WHO BROUGHT UP BY A PIOUS AND GOOD MOTHER IN THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF ALL HER DUTIES HAS NEVER FAILED,--NEVER
PRAY EXCUSE ME MONSIEUR
FOR THE CHOUETTE ALTHOUGH BOILING OVER WITH RAGE AT SEEING ME DEVOUR THE BARLEY-SUGAR COULD NOT LEAVE HER STOVE FOR THE FISH WAS FRYING HA
AND HAD NOT THIS ADVENTURE ANY CONSEQUENCES IT COULD NOT
PARDON ME YOUNG MAN,--RESPECT TO THE LADIES,--ALLOW THE CHOUETTE TO PASS FIRST
OH IF I WERE A MAN HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A HUSBANDMAN TO GO OUT IN THE FIELDS AND DRIVE ONE'S OWN PLOUGH
IN THE MIDST OF THIS WELL REGULATED AND VIRTUOUS COURT ACCUSTOMED AFTER THE EXAMPLE OF ITS RULER TO HONEST PLEASURES AND HARMLESS AMUSEMENTS RODOLPH INSTRUCTED BY POLIDORI DREAMT OF THE DISSIPATED NIGHTS OF VERSAILLES THE ORGIES OF CHOISY THE ATTRACTIVE VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF THE PARC-AU-CERFS AND ALSO FROM TIME TO TIME OF SOME ROMANTIC AMOURS CONTRASTING WITH THESE
BUT THAT WAS ONLY AN EXCUSE FOR ASKING CHARITY
AFTER WALKING AND WALKING I FAIRLY LOST MYSELF
BUT NOW I COULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SEE HER AGAIN,--I SHOULD DIE WITH SHAME IF I MET HER SO THEN MY POOR GIRL SAID RODOLPH YOU SPENT YOUR MONEY IN THE COUNTRY,--YOU LIKE THE COUNTRY DO YOU LIKE IT
WHAT DOES THE BLEEDING HEART MEAN
BUT THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
THANKS TO THE CHARMING GALLANTRY OF THE PAINTER PIPELET'S MORTAL FOE THE DOOR OF HER CHAMBER WAS ORNAMENTED AFTER THE MANNER OF WATTEAU WITH A PANEL DESIGN REPRESENTING ABOUT HALF A DOZEN FAT LITTLE CHUBBY LOVES GROUPED ROUND A SPACE PAINTED SKY BLUE AND ON WHICH WAS TRACED IN PINK LETTERS MADEMOISELLE RIGOLETTE DRESSMAKER THESE PLUMP LITTLE CUPIDS HAD ALL A TASK TO PERFORM BESIDES ENCIRCLING THIS IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
GERMAIN TOOK THE ROOM THIS ABOMINABLE PAINTER OCCUPIED
IF ONLY FOR EIGHT DAYS LET ME LIVE
WHY THE FOLKS IN ST MARTIN ARE AS LOVING AS THE REST OF THE WORLD
WE CAN EASILY STOP OUR CARRIAGE POOR FLEUR-DE-MARIE CAST DOWN HER EYES
THOUGH TURNED THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE SARAH LOOKED MUCH YOUNGER
WHY IS IT THAT LOVELY AS ARE YOUR FAIR GUESTS THEIR CHARMS ARE NEVER SEEN TO SUCH PERFECTION AS WHEN ASSEMBLED BENEATH YOUR HOSPITABLE ROOF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS PLEASED TO VIEW OUR FAIR VISITANTS THROUGH THE SAME FLATTERING MEDIUM WITH WHICH YOU ARE GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO BEHOLD OUR POOR ENDEAVOURS FOR YOUR AND THEIR AMUSEMENT ANSWERED THE AMBASSADOR WITH A DEFERENTIAL BOW
GOD IS ALL-POWERFUL PROVIDENCE PLACED ME IN YOUR PATH M
DAVID I DEPEND UPON YOUR ASSISTANCE MY LORD KNOWS FULL WELL THAT I AM WHOLLY DEVOTED TO HIM BOTH BODY AND SOUL REPLIED THE NEGRO COLDLY
DOES NOT SHE DESERVE COMPASSION AND RESPECT,--YES RESPECT,--WHO UNHAPPY GIRL
RODOLPH PAYS ME FOR MY TIME SO MY TIME IS HIS AND I WILL EMPLOY IT FOR HIM THEN AN IDEA STRIKES ME
HE WAS ABOUT TO DISCHARGE A SOLEMN SELF-IMPOSED AND IMPORTANT DUTY
TORTILLARD GO WITH MADAME THE HIDEOUS BRAT HOPPED FORWARD AND TOOK HOLD OF THE ONE-EYED'S HAND
ONLY THEY PREVENTED ME WERE YOU SORRY THEN TO HAVE YOUR SENTENCE COMMUTED YES
ON ENTERING THE TAPIS-FRANC THE CHOURINEUR LAYING ONE OF HIS HEAVY HANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF RODOLPH CRIED HAIL THE CONQUEROR OF THE CHOURINEUR
RODOLPH SURMISED THAT VERY POSSIBLY THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS THE HUSBAND OF THAT UNHAPPY LADY
AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM ASKS I AGAIN
THE POLITICIAN UPON THE SAME TERMS BORES THE WORLD AND HIS FRIENDS WITH HIS PERPETUAL OUTPOURINGS UPON POLITICAL ECONOMY
BUT A HUNDRED FRANCS!--THAT IS A LARGE SUM
NO INDEED SIR,--IT WAS A FINE TALL SLENDER-LOOKING LADY NOT A FEMALE AND COVERED OVER WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL
AND SO HE WHO ACTS THUS OUGHT TO BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND MY LORD I PRAY YOU DO NOT THINK THAT I WOULD FOR A MOMENT ASSERT THAT YOU HAVE BESTOWED YOUR BENEFITS UNWORTHILY ONE WORD MORE MY OLD FRIEND
AND BY WAY OF VARYING YOUR PUNISHMENT I WILL ONLY SAY THAT THE INFERNAL POLIDORI HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE MORE INGENIOUSLY DISGUISED THE POISONOUS DRAUGHT OF FLATTERY WHEN SEEKING TO PERSUADE SOME POOR VICTIM TO SWALLOW IT MY LORD I AM NOW EFFECTUALLY SILENCED THEN SAID MURPHY AND THIS TIME WITH AN AIR OF REAL SERIOUSNESS YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS NOW NO DOUBT AS TO ITS BEING REALLY POLIDORI YOU ENCOUNTERED IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE I HAVE CEASED TO HAVE THE LEAST DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT SINCE I LEARNED THROUGH YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN IN PARIS FOR SOME TIME PAST I HAD FORGOTTEN OR RATHER PURPOSELY OMITTED TO MENTION TO YOUR LORDSHIP SAID MURPHY IN A SORROWING TONE A NAME THAT NEVER FAILED TO AWAKEN PAINFUL FEELINGS
A NEGRO OF MIDDLE STATURE WITH WHITE HAIR AND EYEBROWS WEARING AN ORANGE AND GREEN RIBAND AT THE BUTTONHOLE OF HIS BLUE COAT SAT BY THE BEDSIDE HOLDING IN HIS RIGHT HAND A SECONDS WATCH WHICH HE APPEARED TO CONSULT WHILE COUNTING WITH HIS LEFT THE BEATING OF RODOLPH'S PULSE
I DID NOT COMMIT THAT CRIME OR OF BEING CONDUCTED OUT OF FRANCE UNDER MY DIRECTION TO A PLACE OF PERPETUAL CONFINEMENT WHERE YOUR LOT WILL BE LESS PAINFUL THAN AT THE BAGNE
LET US GO IN SAID RODOLPH
I WANT NOTHING OF THEM,--I COMPLAIN OF NOTHING,--BUT THERE ARE LOTS HAPPIER THAN MINE YOURS
IF ON THE CONTRARY THE JOB WAS TO BE DONE IN PARIS WE SHOULD HAVE GAINED THE BARRIER DE L'ETOILE BY THE ROAD OF THE RIVOLTE AND THENCE TO THE ALLEE DES VEUVES IS BUT A STEP
THE GRAND DUKE A MOST WORTHY GENTLEMAN GOVERNED HIS STATES WITH WISE FIRMNESS AND PATERNAL KINDNESS
RECOMPENSE
GO AND SWALLOW THAT PILL MY TWO-FARTHING CAPTAIN SAYS I TO MYSELF
MADAME PIPELET RETURNED BEARING THE BOTTLE OF CASSIA AND TWO GLASSES
BUT RODOLPH WAS ON HIS GUARD AND REPLIED
ON THE CONTRARY I BEGAN TO LIKE MY TRADE
YOU'LL COME WITH US GOUALEUSE INQUIRED THE UNKNOWN
AFTER A LONG LIFE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE EXPIATION OF YOUR CRIMES YOU MAY VENTURE TO IMPLORE OF THE ALMIGHTY THE GREAT THOUGH UNMERITED HAPPINESS OF OBTAINING THE PARDON OF YOUR WIFE AND SON AND DYING IN THEIR PRESENCE AS RODOLPH UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS HIS VOICE TREMBLED WITH EMOTION AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONCLUDE
BUT I HARDLY SEE MUCH GOOD IT CAN DO AS THEY ARE SO SHORTLY TO BE TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE THEN AS IF SUDDENLY STRUCK WITH A NEW IDEA M
MURPHY THOSE WORDS CHEERED ME UP AGAIN DIRECTLY
YOU WILL HURT YOURSELF TO THIS CAUTION THE CHOURINEUR PAID NO ATTENTION BUT SEEMED WHOLLY ABSORBED IN SO DISCHARGING HIS NEW MISSION AS SHOULD EFFECTUALLY DESTROY ALL RECOLLECTION OF HIS LATE CLUMSINESS
THEY KNEW THE CARE HE HAD BESTOWED ON HIM WHEN HE LAY TOSSING WITH FEVER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AND SHAKING OFF THE DEADENING APATHY WHICH ORDINARILY BESETS SLAVERY THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES EVINCED THEIR INDIGNATION OR RATHER GRIEF MOST POWERFULLY WHEN THEY SAW DAVID LACERATED BY THE WHIP
TO ALL THESE OBJECTIONS SARAH REPLIED UNMOVED
AND SORE WEARY AND EXHAUSTED HE WAS COMPELLED TO RELINQUISH THE FRUITLESS TASK
EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE BELIEVED HIM TO BE EMPLOYED IN SOME COUNTING-HOUSE OR OFFICE AS HE WENT OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING AND NEVER RETURNED TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
ONCE MORE I REPEAT TO YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE YOU MAY NOW AT YOUR OWN PLEASURE REALISE THE DREAM OF OUR JOURNEY
I HAVE TAKEN IT AND TO-MORROW I SHALL SEND IN MY FURNITURE WELL THEN THANK GOD FOR A GOOD LODGER
THE BARON WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WITH HAIR GRAY THIN AND LIGHTLY CURLED AND POWDERED
TO PUNISH THE BODY IS EASILY DONE
THERE WERE IN THE PLANTATION TEN CAPUSSES OR METISSES AS PRETTY AS CECILY
AT A DISTANCE THE CHOUETTE THREATENED ME WITH HER LONG IRON FORK
IT RAINS AND THE LITTLE BRAT IS TIRED OF WAITING SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER SWEARING
SHE HAD A FULL COLOUR AND STRONG SYMPTOMS OF A BEARD
HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS REVERIE BY AN UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE
FURTHER RODOLPH HAD UNDESIGNEDLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF AN ADVENTURE IN WHICH THE CHARLATAN CESAR BRADAMANTI POSSIBLY POLIDORI AND A FEMALE EVIDENTLY OF RANK AND FASHION WERE THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS
THE LANDLORD OF THE BLEEDING HEART AFTER HAVING RESPONDED TO THE SIGNAL OF THE SCHOOLMASTER ADVANCED POLITELY TO THE THRESHOLD OF HIS DOOR
GRAND DUKE
SO THE HOUSE IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES WILL BE UNINHABITED UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW UNINHABITED EXCEPT THE PORTER I SEE
AND JUST AS HE HAD RECALLED EACH PARTICULAR AND WAS DEEPLY CONSIDERING THE POSSIBLE RESULT OF THE WHOLE HE BECAME AWARE THAT HIS FEET WERE WHOLLY SUBMERGED IN WATER
YOU SAID I WAS TO SHOW HER UP THEN WHY DO YOU NOT OBEY ME BECAUSE THE LADY SPEAK OUT WOMAN IF YOU CAN THE LADY HAS GONE AGAIN SOMETHING YOU HAVE SAID OR DONE THEN TO OFFEND HER I AM SURE ROARED HE IN A PERFECT FURY
AND EVEN IN THAT TERRIBLE MOMENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT BRUTALISED BY TERROR YOU WOULD BE A MERE MASS OF HUMAN FLESH OFFERED UP BY JUSTICE AS AN EXPIATORY OFFERING TO THE MANES OF YOUR VICTIMS
HIS DISPOSITION HIS INSTINCTS ARE ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN TO THE READER SO THAT HE MAY UNDERSTAND THAT NO PROPOSAL COULD HAVE BEEN MADE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO HIM
RODOLPH LOOKED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE TOWARDS THE BARRIER AND AT LAST OBSERVED A MAN AND WOMAN WHO WERE COMING TOWARDS HIM UNDER THE SHELTER OF AN UMBRELLA AND WHOM HE RECOGNISED AS THE CHOUETTE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER
THUS ONE MAN WHO FANCIES HE POSSESSES A WARLIKE AIR ASSUMES THE WARRIOR
I NEVER HAD A BROTHER
IF HE COMES NEARER I WILL CRY OUT FOR HELP AND FOR FEAR OF THE DISTURBANCE WHICH MAY CALL IN THE POLICE THE OGRESS WILL TAKE MY PART DON'T BE ALARMED MY CHILD SAID RODOLPH LOOKING CALMLY AT THE SCHOOLMASTER
THE MAN OF WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN HAVING ENTERED THE RUE AUX FEVES WHICH IS IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITE SLACKENED HIS PACE
HER TRIPLE TRADE CONSISTED IN LETTING FURNISHED APARTMENTS KEEPING A PUBLIC-HOUSE AND LENDING CLOTHES TO THE MISERABLE CREATURES WHO INFEST THESE FOUL STREETS
THE BEAST WAS REGAINING THE MASTERY
BUT I HAVE DONE WORSE THAN ROB HE ADDED BENDING HIS HEAD DOWN
AND WHERE THE DEVIL DID YOU PICK IT UP
BUT I WILL KILL YOU AS I DID HIM AND SAYING THAT HE MADE SO VIOLENT A HEAVE AND GAVE SO POWERFUL A JERK WITH HIS LEGS AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE HALF THREW ME OVER
LE CURE IS WAITING FOR YOU ARE THE POST-HORSES ARRIVED MY LAD INQUIRED RODOLPH
THANK GOD
YOU SO GENTLE SO MODEST AND GOOD-LOOKING SO TENDERLY BELOVED BY YOUR AUNT AND SO WELL SPOKEN OF BY THE CURE FOR ALL THE VIRTUES AND QUALIFICATIONS WHICH MAKE A GOOD WIFE WILL HAVE NO SCARCITY OF OFFERS FOR YOUR HAND IN THE DANCE,--INDEED ALL THE PRINCIPAL YOUNG FARMERS WILL BE ANXIOUS TO SECURE YOU AS A PARTNER BY WAY OF OPENING AN ACQUAINTANCE WHICH SHALL LAST FOR LIFE
WHY I HAVE FOUND OUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE CARE OF YOU BEFORE YOU WERE HANDED OVER TO ME
THE GENEROUS MAN WHO HAS SAVED YOU HAS REALISED THE WORDS OF HOLY WRIT THE LORD IS NEAR TO ALL THOSE WHO CALL UPON HIM
I HAVE PUT IT IN THE LETTER-BOOT,--THERE YOU SEE
I WAS MOVED EVEN TO TEARS
HOW MANY THERE ARE
WELL I SUPPOSE THERE WERE UPWARDS OF TWENTY DIFFERENT PETITIONS SENT TO OUR CHIEF LESSEE M
WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME IN THE STREETS
THE RESULTS OF HIS VISIT TO THE HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE WERE HIGHLY IMPORTANT BOTH AS REGARDED THE SOLUTION OF THE DEEP MYSTERY HE SO ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNRAVEL AND ALSO AS AFFORDING A WIDE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS EARNEST ENDEAVOURS TO DO GOOD AND TO PREVENT EVIL
THEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DINNER WITH YOUR AUNT
HE LOOKED AT MURPHY STEADFASTLY BOWED HIS HEAD AND THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE MURMURED IN FALTERING ACCENTS AH SIR YOU ARE NOW CRUEL INDEED
RODOLPH HOW KIND YOU HAVE BEEN TO ME IN WHAT WAY
HER NOSE WAS AQUILINE
IT WAS REQUISITE TO STOOP IN PASSING IN AT THE DOOR OF THE CABARET WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO TWO APARTMENTS
THE ATTEMPT I PROPOSE IS A FAMOUS ONE BECAUSE THE PERSON IN QUESTION IS IN THE COUNTRY
THE SERGEANT REPEATED THE CHOURINEUR RETREATING STEP BY STEP WITH HIS EYES FIXED AND HAGGARD AND POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AS IF AT SOME INVISIBLE PHANTOM
YOU JUDGE ME WRONG,--YOU MISTAKE
YOU AND THE CHOURINEUR CERTAINLY DO OWE SOME SATISFACTION TO MY WIFE AND MYSELF,--YOU HAVE CAUSED US TO LOSE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FRANCS
YES OR NO?--BECAUSE I AM REGULARLY DONE UP AND MUST GET A SHORT SNOOZE SOMEWHERE
I HAVE ONLY ONE EYE BUT THAT IS A PIERCER
THAT'S THE REASON THEN THAT YOUR HANDS ARE SO WHITE ADDED THE CHOURINEUR
I SAY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS DOES WRONG IN COMPELLING A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING TO RECALL THE SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED TO YOU SAID THE SQUIRE IN A CALM TONE
THINK OF THE EXCELLENT ADVICE YOU HAVE BEEN GIVING ME WHICH YOU HAVE PROMISED ME TO FOLLOW I HAVE
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT M
HOLD YOUR JAW
THOUGH ONLY A FAN-PAINTER YET HE IS AS DOWNY IN FLASH AS I AM MYSELF
OH M
RODOLPH SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE
RODOLPH STARTED
THIS ADVANTAGE RESULTS GENERALLY FROM THEIR BODILY TRAINING WHICH IS SIMPLE RURAL AND DEVELOPS THEIR FULL VIGOUR
BUT PRAY GO ON AND I WILL NOT SPEAK AGAIN TILL YOU HAVE FINISHED PAINTING THIS DEAR FARM YOUR ROOM IS ON THE FIRST FLOOR MY ROOM
AND ONCE AGAIN SHE APPEARED ABSORBED IN THE PLEASURE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ALLOWING HERSELF TO RECOLLECT THE FUTURE THAT WOULD SUCCEED IT
I DID NOT ASK FROM CURIOSITY
FIRST HE HAD ASCERTAINED THAT MLLE
MY NAME?--THE ALBINO
BUT M
NOW THEN YOU BEGIN WELL THEN--NO
WELL THAT IS ODD GOUALEUSE
NOTHING WAS HEARD BUT THE SPLASH SPLASH OF THE RAIN WITHOUT AS IT FELL FROM THE ROOF ON TO THE PAVEMENT
BEFORE SHE DIED THE POOR OLD THING SAID THAT SHE HAD BITTEN ONE OF HER MURDERERS IN THE HAND
HE IS NOTHING BUT AN UPSTART I AM SURE,--A NOBODY WHO HAS SUDDENLY TUMBLED INTO MONEY HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEND PROPERLY,--A RICH MAN'S HEAD AND A BEGGAR'S BODY WHO SQUANDERS WITH ONE HAND AND NIPS AND PINCHES WITH THE OTHER
IT WAS COMPOSED OF A GROUND FLOOR OCCUPIED BY A MAN KEEPING A LOW SORT OF DRAM-SHOP AND FOUR UPPER STORIES SURMOUNTED BY ATTICS
THE DISPLAY OF SUCH FEELING QUITE SURPRISED HIM
SHE SOON TOLD HIM THAT SHE SHARED HIS LOVE ALTHOUGH SHE FORESAW THAT THIS LOVE WOULD CREATE GREAT TROUBLE
PRODUCED BY DAVID EDWARDS CHRISTINE ALDRIDGE AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET STANFORD UNIVERSITY SUL BOOKS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES
A THICK CARPET COVERED THE FLOOR A GOOD FIRE BURNT IN THE GRATE AND TWO LARGE NOSEGAYS OF DAISIES OF ALL COLOURS PLACED IN TWO CRYSTAL VASES SHED THEIR AGREEABLE ODOUR THROUGHOUT THE ROOM
MY EARS HAD SINGING IN THEM AND I SAW EVERYTHING RED_,--ALL WAS RED
RODOLPH TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE TO REMAIN HERE FOR THE FUTURE
LET US HAVE A WINDOW OPEN AND JOINING THE ACTION TO THE WORDS RODOLPH WITH MUCH DEXTERITY LET FALL OUTSIDE THE WINDOW THE MORSEL OF PAPER FOLDED VERY SMALL ON WHICH HE HAD HASTILY WRITTEN A FEW WORDS IN PENCIL UNDER HIS BLOUSE
MY MISTAKE WAS NOT TO HAVE TOLD YOU ALL MY GOOD FELLOW
HAD IT PROVED SO HE WOULD HAVE REMOVED THEM WITH THAT DELICATE ASSUMPTION OF MYSTERY YOU KNOW HE SO FREQUENTLY EMPLOYS TO VEIL HIS MUNIFICENCE
THE WOMEN
I SAW THE CHOURINEUR YESTERDAY ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT THE TAPIS-FRANC AND APPOINTED TO MEET HIM HERE TO-DAY IN CASE HE CHOSE TO JOIN US,--TO BE OUR FELLOW LABOURER
HISTORY OF LA GOUALEUSE
THE PARROT WAS WELL KNOWN
A BLUE COAT BUTTONED UP CLOSELY ON THE RIGHT BREAST OF WHICH SPARKLED A DIAMOND STAR DISPLAYED TO ADMIRATION THE LIGHT YET PERFECT PROPORTIONS OF HIS GRACEFUL FIGURE WHILE HIS WELL-FITTING PANTALOONS OF BLACK KERSEYMERE DEFINED THE FINELY FORMED LEG AND HANDSOME FOOT IN ITS EMBROIDERED STOCKING
SO THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT THIS REPLY NOBLE AS IT WAS IN ITSELF BUT OF THE RECTITUDE OF WHICH THE CHOURINEUR HIMSELF HAD NO IDEA PERFECTLY ASTONISHED RODOLPH
BUT AS YOU KNOW MY LIFE--ALL MY LIFE AND AS YOU AID ME ALWAYS WITH AS MUCH FIDELITY AS COURAGE IN MY SELF-INFLICTED EXPIATION IT IS MY DUTY OR IF YOU LIKE THE PHRASE BETTER MY GRATITUDE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT I AM NOT ACTING FROM A FRIVOLOUS IMPULSE OF THAT I AM SURE MY LORD YOU KNOW MY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GOOD WHICH A MAN OUGHT TO DO WHO HAS THE KNOWLEDGE THE WILL AND THE POWER
DARKNESS CAME ON TO THIS DEN SO COMPLETELY THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE IN ONE OF THE ANGLES OF THIS INNER APARTMENT THE OPEN MOUTH OF ONE OF THOSE CELLARS WHICH ARE ENTERED BY A DOOR IN TWO DIVISIONS ONE OF WHICH WAS CONSTANTLY KEPT OPEN FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF ACCESS
THEN YOU WILL PRACTISE YOUR WRITING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND WHEN THAT IS DONE JOIN YOUR AUNT IN HER ROUND OF VISITS TO THE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS OF THE FARM
CHAPTER VIII
YES REALLY HE HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO REMARK TO ME THE OTHER DAY WHAT COMPLICATED MACHINERY IS CONTAINED IN THE GRAND MACHINE OF STATE AFFAIRS
RODOLPH HIMSELF IN SPITE OF HIS NATURAL INTREPIDITY COULD NOT WHOLLY SUBDUE A SLIGHT EMOTION AT THE SIGHT OF THIS REDOUBTABLE RUFFIAN WHOM HE CONTEMPLATED FOR SOME SECONDS WITH A MIXED FEELING OF CURIOSITY AND HORROR
WERE IT NOT THAT A THIRD PARTY IS IMPLICATED IN IT I SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THE WHOLE TO YOU LONG AGO
TO PULL OUT YOUR HAIR NO
I LIKE THAT BEST WELL THEN M
WELL WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I LEFT THE GAOL
FOR IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET THE LORD RAISES UP ALL THOSE WHO ARE READY TO FALL AND ELEVATES THOSE WHO ARE OPPRESSED MURPHY AT THIS MOMENT OPENED THE DOOR
FROM THE FRENCH HORN TO THE FLAGEOLET HE MADE USE OF ALL AND EVEN CARRIED HIS RASCALITY SO FAR AS TO PLAY FALSE AND TO KEEP BLOWING THE SAME NOTE FOR HOURS TOGETHER
THE SIGN WAS SUPPORTED BY A POST ERECTED ABOVE THIS CAVE,--THIS REAL HUMAN BURROW
IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO GO DOWN-STAIRS I WILL REJOIN YOU AND SO SAYING PIPELET COMMENCED ASCENDING THE STEEP LADDER COMMUNICATING WITH HIS WAREHOUSE AS HE STYLED IT,--A SOMEWHAT PERILOUS FEAT FOR A PERSON OF HIS AGE
AND THAT MUST NOT BE
A CONCEALED WITNESS HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THIS TRANSACTION
IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM AND IF I HAD HAD SOMETHING TO EAT I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF FOR THE WINTER LIKE ME IN THE LIME-KILN I DID NOT DARE TO QUIT THE TIMBER-YARD FOR I FANCIED THAT THE CHOUETTE WOULD SEEK FOR ME EVERYWHERE TO PULL OUT MY TEETH AND DROWN ME AND THAT SHE WOULD BE SURE TO CATCH ME IF I STIRRED FROM WHERE I WAS STAY DO NOT MENTION THAT OLD BEAST'S NAME AGAIN,--IT MAKES THE BLOOD COME INTO MY EYES
AND WHO LIVES ON THE SECOND FLOOR INQUIRED HE OF THE PORTERESS
SHE RAN RETURNED STOPPED AND THEN RACED OFF AGAIN WITH RENEWED HAPPINESS
YES IT IS FOR YOU MY CHILD
YOU TOO CHOURINEUR AN ORPHAN OF THE STREETS OF PARIS LIKE YOU MY GIRL THEN WHO BROUGHT YOU UP GOUALEUSE ASKED RODOLPH
IT IS ALSO SAID THAT M
BUT TELL ME NOW SAID HE
I DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO SLEEP
YOU PERCEIVE HIS DEEP DESIRE TO ATTRACT YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION AND SO AND HERE RODOLPH STRUCK BY THE CONTINUED SILENCE OF LA GOUALEUSE LOOKED UP AT HER
THE CHOUETTE BARGAINED FOR A RED SHAWL,--AN OLD MONSTER
BY JOVE
THERE WAS THE FEROCIOUS OR EMBRUTED FACE,--THE VULGAR AND LICENTIOUS MIRTH
YOU GO IN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES JUST TO WARM YOURSELF AND TO SPEAK A FEW KIND WORDS TO THE HONEST LABOURERS WHO ARE ENJOYING A HEARTY MEAL AFTER THE DAY'S TOIL IS OVER
A LARGE BLACK CAT WITH GREEN EYES WAS SITTING NEAR THE OGRESS AND SEEMED THE FAMILIAR DEMON OF THE PLACE
THE COUNTER COVERED WITH LEAD WAS DECKED WITH JUGS WITH IRON HOOPS AND VARIOUS PEWTER MEASURES
THE COUNTENANCE OF THE GOUALEUSE BECAME STILL MORE SADDENED
AS I WAS JUST THE FELLOW FOR A GRENADIER THEY TOOK ME WITH YOUR STRENGTH COURAGE AND TASTE FOR CHOPPING AND SLASHING YOU OUGHT IN WAR-TIME TO HAVE BEEN MADE AN OFFICER THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
WHY I COULD NOT DRINK THAT WITHOUT BEING QUITE FUDDLED IT WAS HER USUAL QUANTITY
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU WHY IF YOU COULD SPARE YOUR SMALL BOY TO MY MISTRESS FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAS LOST SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD HELP HER TO LOOK FOR BRAS ROUGE WINKED HIS EYE AND MADE A SIGN TO THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THEN SAID TO THE CHILD
AND WHAT IS THAT LITTLE BLUE THING AT THE END IT IS A PRESENT FROM MY MAN WHICH I SHALL WEAR UNTIL HE GIVES ME A TICKER ISN'T IT FOURLINE RODOLPH'S SUSPICIONS WERE THUS HALF CONFIRMED AND HE WAITED WITH ANXIETY FOR THE REPLY OF THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO SAID
WHEN M
AND WHEN YOU HAD FETCHED THE WORMS FOR THE CHOUETTE WHAT DID YOU DO INQUIRED THE CHOURINEUR
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WILL NEVER REFUSE ASSISTANCE TO THE UNHAPPY
17 ALLEE DES VEUVES ISN'T IT MY MAN CRIED THE CHOUETTE IMPATIENTLY
AMBASSADRESS
AT THE SIGHT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE MISCHANCE THE CHOURINEUR REMAINED IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT ONE OF HIS HUGE LEGS IN THE AIR HIS TOES NERVOUSLY CONTRACTED AND LOOKING WITH A STUPEFIED AIR ALTERNATELY FROM THE DOCTOR TO THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BOTTLE AND FROM THAT TO THE MORSEL HIS THUMB AND FINGER WERE YET TIGHTLY HOLDING
SURELY SO FINE AND NOBLE A COUNTENANCE BESPEAKS A MIND EQUALLY SUPERIOR TO ALL MANKIND
I WILL THEREFORE SPARE YOUR MODESTY AND CONTINUE MY RELATION
THUS THEN OUR DESIGNING PAIR WERE ESTABLISHED AT THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN AGREEABLY AND SECURELY PLACED WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO RODOLPH
IF HE BEHAVES WELL HE SHALL HAVE HIS POCKETBOOK
KNOWS ALL ABOUT PHYSIC
L'AMBASSADEUR OWN THAT I HAVE MADE OUT A GOOD CASE AND THAT YOU ENTIRELY CONCUR WITH ME IN OPINION YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS AFFORDED ME TOO MANY PREVIOUS REASONS TO ADMIRE AND ADOPT YOUR OPINIONS FOR ME TO HESITATE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE AND FOR ME MY LORD SAID THE COUNTESS AT THE RISK OF BEING INCLUDED AMONG THOSE FAIR LADIES WHO GET A LITTLE MORE PRAISE OR FLATTERY WHICH WAS IT YOUR HIGHNESS STYLED IT THAN THEY DESERVE I ACCEPT YOUR VERY FLATTERING EXPLANATION WITH AS MUCH QUALIFIED PLEASURE AS IF IT WERE REALLY FOUNDED ON TRUTH IN ORDER MORE EFFECTUALLY TO CONVINCE YOU MADAME THAT NOTHING IS MORE CORRECT THAN ALL I HAVE ASSERTED LET US MAKE A FEW OBSERVATIONS TOUCHING THE FINE EFFECT OF PRAISE IN ANIMATING AND LIGHTING UP THE COUNTENANCE AH MY LORD YOU ARE LAYING A VERY MISCHIEVOUS SNARE FOR ME SAID THE COUNTESS SMILING
NOW SAID RODOLPH MOVING A FEW PACES FROM GOUALEUSE AND SPEAKING LOW NOW WILL YOU RENDER ME A REAL SERVICE NAME IT MASTER RODOLPH THE CHOUETTE DOES NOT KNOW YOU I SAW HER YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE TAPIS-FRANC THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST DO
ARE YOU GOING TO MURDER ME THEN
ON THAT NIGHT WITH THE CATTLE-DEALER I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF JUDGING OF YOU
THE TWO LADIES THEN SEATED THEMSELVES ON A DIVAN ALMOST CONCEALED BENEATH THE CLUSTERING SHRUBS AND OVERHANGING PLANTS
ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH HIM NOT AT ALL
I AM DELIGHTED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO YOU--DELIGHTED--OR RATHER TO RENEW OUR ACQUAINTANCE
IT WAS TOO LATE POOR MURPHY HE WAS STRUGGLING ON THE GROUND WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER AT THE ENTRANCE AND ALTHOUGH WOUNDED HE HELD HIS VOICE AND MADE NO CRY FOR HELP
HERMENEGILDE OF WHICH HIS AUNT IS THE SUPERIOR THE POOR NUNS BARON
YOUNG MAN SHE GOT INSIDE THE HOUSE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH PRIDE
HIS PEAKED NOSE HIS RECEDING CHIN HIS HIGH CHEEK-BONES HIS SMALL EYES BLACK RESTLESS AND KEEN GAVE HIS FEATURES AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION OF MALICE CUNNING AND SAGACITY
I WAS STILL ON MY KNEES WHEN SHE SUDDENLY WENT TO A SHELF AND TOOK DOWN A PAIR OF PINCERS PINCERS EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR
THE LAMP LEFT IN THE PASSAGE LIGHTED US A LITTLE
A FOREHEAD OF THE PUREST AND WHITEST SURMOUNTED A FACE OF PERFECT OVAL AND ANGEL-LIKE EXPRESSION
UNFORTUNATELY BETWEEN HIS OVERANXIETY TO ACQUIT HIMSELF WELL IN HIS IMPORTANT MISSION AND HIS FEAR OF DROPPING THE DELICATE PHIAL HE WAS BRINGING SO OVERCAREFULLY HE GRASPED THE SLIGHT NECK SO TIGHTLY IN HIS HUGE HAND THAT IT SHIVERED TO ATOMS AND THE PRECIOUS LIQUID WAS EXPENDED ON THE CARPET
A FEW WORDS CONCERNING RODOLPH'S EARLY DAYS MAY BE NECESSARY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS E-TEXT THESE PAGES HAVE BEEN COMBINED INTO ONE ENTRY
SHE GOT UP AND IN A DESPERATE RAGE
THE MAN DROVE ONE OF THE SHEEP TO THE DOOR
YOU ARE AS HANDSOME AS A VENUS AND YET ONLY SIXTEEN AND A HALF
THE CHOURINEUR WAS INSTANTLY SILENT
HE SEEING SOME ONE WITH HER WILL NOT APPROACH
RECOVER YOURSELF MY GOOD FELLOW THERE
STAY MADAME WE WILL HAVE THREE GLASSES IF YOU PLEASE
YOU ARE A DAINTY DOG I KNOW AND AS FOND AS EVER OF THEM HARLEQUINS WELL NOW GOUALEUSE SAID THE CHOURINEUR ARE YOU HUNGRY NO CHOURINEUR WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING BETTER THAN A HARLEQUIN MY LASS SAID RODOLPH
AN APPRENTICE TRIES TO HIT HIS MASTER A THUMP
THE CONFUSION OF THE POOR CHOURINEUR WAS STILL FURTHER INCREASED FROM HAVING WHEN BEHIND HIS CURTAIN HEARD THE BLACK DOCTOR ADDRESS RODOLPH CONTINUALLY AS MY LORD OR YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS APPROACH MY FRIEND,--MY DELIVERER SAID RODOLPH AND GIVE ME YOUR HAND I BEG PARDON SIR,--I MEAN MY LORD,--NO HIGHNESS,--NO CALL ME M
IT REMINDED ME OF THE LIME-KILNS IN MY HAPPY DAYS
RODOLPH YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TOLD WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU IF YOU DIE IN ONE OF THOSE PLACES NO INDEED I HAVE NOT
FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HIS ADVICE BUT THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE GRAND DUKE'S ANGER IF ALL WERE DISCOVERED
IT IS SO FINE
THAT'S TRUE,--IN OUR MISERY SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE WHO ADDRESSED HERSELF TO THE CHOURINEUR ALMOST ALWAYS FEELING IN SPITE OF HERSELF A SORT OF SHAME AT THE PRESENCE OF RODOLPH HARDLY VENTURING TO RAISE HER EYES TO HIM ALTHOUGH IN APPEARANCE HE BELONGED TO THAT CLASS WITH WHOM SHE ORDINARILY LIVED
IT IS MY PART TO ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS NOT YOU MINE MY FORGIVENESS
IF I DID NOT FIRST OFFER YOU THIS IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE OTHER WOULD SUIT YOU AND THE LATTER IS SO HAZARDOUS THAT I WOULD NOT EXPOSE YOU TO IT WITHOUT GIVING YOU THE CHOICE
MY SUCCESS WAS EVEN BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S PAINFUL SILENCE AND TO DRIVE AWAY THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT CONJURED UP BY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PROBABLE GUILT OF MADAME D'HARVILLE HE RESUMED IN A TONE MORE GAY
CHAPTER IX
SOME MOVING THEIR GLASSES AND JUGS TO THE END OF THE TABLE AT WHICH THEY WERE SEATED OFFERED RODOLPH A SEAT IF HE WERE INCLINED TO SIT NEAR THEM
THE CONVICTION OF HIS DANGER RECALLED RODOLPH ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF
I LEARNED MY TRADE UNDER HIM FROM THE TIME WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE
RODOLPH IS SHE NOT PARTICULARLY SO AND LOVES YOU LIKE HER OWN CHILD DEAR GOOD AUNT
SO TWICE I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF ONCE BY SWALLOWING VERDIGRIS AND ANOTHER TIME BY TRYING TO CHOKE MYSELF WITH MY CHAIN
THE MAN WHO HAD GONE OUT FOR A MOMENT AFTER HAVING REQUESTED THE OGRESS TO LOOK AFTER HIS JUG AND PLATE SOON RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL BRAWNY MAN TO WHOM HE SAID IT WAS A CHANCE TO MEET IN THIS WAY OLD FELLOW
IT WILL BE A HEARTACHE THE LESS FOR US ALL BUT IF THEY ARE TURNED OUT FROM HERE WHERE WILL THEY GO TO TRULY I DON'T KNOW AND HOW MUCH CAN THIS POOR WORKMAN EARN DAILY WHEN IN HEALTH AND WITHOUT ANY CALLS UPON HIS TIME OR ATTENTION WHY IF HE HAD NOT TO ATTEND TO HIS OLD MOTHER NURSE HIS SICK WIFE AND LOOK AFTER THE FIVE CHILDREN HE COULD EARN HIS THREE OR FOUR FRANCS A DAY BECAUSE HE WORKS LIKE A DOWNRIGHT SLAVE
MERRILL THIS CHAMBER WILL EXACTLY SUIT ME
THAT'S IT
BY THAT TIME EVERY PRECAUTION WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN BUT ALL THE MONEY IS NOT THERE CONTINUED THE CHOUETTE AND HER ONE GREEN EYE SPARKLED
AND THAT IS NOT ALL WHAT ELSE HAVE I DONE M
WELL EXCEPT THE SKELETON WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BONES OF IRON HE IS SO THIN AND POWERFUL AND THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO COULD EAT THREE HERCULESES FOR HIS BREAKFAST NO MAN LIVING COULD BOAST OF HAVING PUT HIS FOOT ON MY NECK WELL AND WHAT THEN WHY NOW I HAVE FOUND MY MASTER THAT'S ALL
IS IT NOT
ROUND THE PARALLELOGRAM IT DESCRIBED THE WALLS WERE CONCEALED BY AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MIRRORS OVER WHICH WAS PLACED A SMALL AND DELICATE TRELLIS OF FINE GREEN RUSHES WHICH THANKS TO THE STRONG LIGHT REFLECTED ON THE HIGHLY POLISHED GLASS RESEMBLED AN ARBOUR AND WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY HIDDEN BY A THICK ROW OF ORANGE-TREES AS LARGE AS THOSE OF THE TUILERIES MIXED WITH CAMELLIAS OF EQUAL SIZE
RODOLPH'S SO I GOES TO THE ALLEE DES VEUVES TO PLACE MYSELF AND WHAT SHOULD I SEE BUT A SMALL TAVERN NOT TEN PACES FROM YOUR DOOR
SHE NOW LIES IN A DYING STATE
THEN I SAID TO MYSELF I AM VERY WRETCHED BUT I HAVE NEVER INJURED ANYBODY AND IF I HAD ANY ONE TO ADVISE ME I SHOULD NOT BE AS I AM
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BEST THAT SHE ALWAYS REMAINED WITH YOU IF YOU WERE PLEASED WITH HER I SHOULD LIKE IT GREATLY M
MINOR PUNCTUATION AND CAPITALIZATION CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT COMMENT
CERTAIN WRINKLES IN HIS FOREHEAD BETOKENED A MAN OF MEDITATION
THE CHOURINEUR LOOKED AT HIS HOST IN ASTONISHMENT,--ALMOST WITH RESPECT
THE UNKNOWN WAS FOLLOWING WHEN THE CHARCOAL-MAN ACCOSTED HIM AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE AND IN A MOST RESPECTFUL TONE OF REMONSTRANCE PRAY YOUR HIGHNESS BE ON YOUR GUARD THE UNKNOWN SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND REJOINED HIS NEW COMPANION
CHARLES ROBERT INSTEAD OF BEING SO CALLED WOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OF NEARLY ALL OUR DUKES AND PEERS
I THANK THE JUDGES MUCH FOR THEIR KINDNESS
THE SICK-NURSE
MY PAPERS?--HERE'S THE CERTIFICATE OF THE MASTER QUARRYMAN
THEY WANTED TO PLAY HIM A TRICK AND SHUT HIM UP IN MY CELLAR
YOU HAVE WICKEDLY ABUSED THE GREAT BODILY STRENGTH BESTOWED UPON YOU,--I WILL PARALYSE THAT STRENGTH
IT DOES NOT SUIT ME TO PLAY SUCH A FARCE AS THAT YOU SHALL ONLY DO WHAT YOU PLEASE
MONSEIGNEUR HAS DESIRED THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE CALLED BEFORE TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
TO THIS CAUSE MAY BE ASCRIBED THE WONDERFUL PRESERVATION OF COUNTESS SARAH'S APPEARANCE
RODOLPH HAS AFTER ALL MADE HIS ARRANGEMENTS FOR THIS EVENING CONFOUND IT
YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT EXCLAIMED RODOLPH
MADAME GEORGES HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO MAKE ALL THE PREPARATIONS YOU DESIRED WHAT HAS GONE WRONG MURPHY
BUT I HAD FIFTEEN YEARS AT THE GALLEYS INSTEAD OF BEING SCRAGGED I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT WHILST IN THE REGIMENT I HAD SAVED TWO OF MY COMRADES FROM DROWNING IN THE MARNE WHEN WE WERE QUARTERED AT MILAN
ARE YOU AWARE MY DEAR MURPHY THAT AT THE REMODELLING OF THE STATES IN 1815 AT THE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION THE FATHER OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAD A CHANCE OF BEING EXCLUDED FROM HIS WELL-KNOWN ATTACHMENT TO NAPOLEON
I HAVE A SECRET FOR CUTTING FANS IN IVORY BY A MECHANICAL PROCESS BUT THIS SECRET DOES NOT BELONG TO ME ALONE
I PUT MY HANDS TOGETHER AND SAID DON'T HURT ME PRAY
LE CHARGE D'AFFAIRES SAID HE SMILING WILL YOU WARM YOURSELF AT THE FIRE
A CHEERFUL FIRE WAS BURNING ON THE HEARTH
RODOLPH WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE CHOURINEUR AND WATCHED HIM ATTENTIVELY ALMOST ANXIOUSLY
BUT THOUGH M
LIVE AND REPENT REPENT SHOUTED THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A FEARFUL VOICE
RODOLPH SAID THE CHOURINEUR PALE AND TREMBLING M
A GOOD HORSE AND A GOOD RIDER SAID RODOLPH LEANING FORWARD TO THE DOOR OF THE COACH AND FOLLOWING MURPHY FOR IT WAS HE WITH HIS EYES
THE MORE HOWEVER I CHOPPED DOWN THE SOLDIERS THE FASTER THE RANKS FILLED UP WITH OTHERS
WHILST HIS SHIRT AND CRAVAT WERE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR WHITENESS
YOU PERHAPS DISTRUST ME
HIS KNIFE FELL FROM HIS HANDS
DAVID'S CARE AND ATTENTION HAVE WORKED WONDERS
AND SINGULAR INDEED DID THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THUS COMING ACROSS HIM STRIKE RODOLPH
LE COMTE HE AND I ARE TWO OLD FRIENDS WHO ARE ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO MEET
WILL YOU FOR A DAY OR TWO MAKE SHIFT WITH MY CRIB
THERE'S A SUM!--SIXTY FRANCS IN ONE MONTH OH BUT ONE LIKES TO SHOW OFF SOMETIMES AND TO INDULGE IN A LITTLE IDLENESS THERE NOW M
NEXT DAY ALL WAS ARRANGED AND THE CHOURINEUR SET OUT FOR ALGIERS
TAKING THE ARM OF MARIE HE WALKED AWAY WITH HER TOWARDS THE FARM BUILDINGS AND SO QUICKLY THAT TO KEEP UP WITH HIM GOUALEUSE WAS OBLIGED TO RUN AS IN HER INFANT DAYS SHE RAN BESIDE THE CHOUETTE
WE CAN TALK BETTER HE SAID AND NEED NOT TALK SO LOUD AND THEN YOU CAN PREVENT ME FROM GOING OUT REPLIED RODOLPH CALMLY
I HAD MY ARMS ROUND THE NECK OF THE VILLAIN MY CHEEK AGAINST HIS CHEEK
RODOLPH WAS NOT SURPRISED AT THE GRAVITY OF FLEUR-DE-MARIE
THE LEAST SAID IS SOONEST MENDED AS THE OLD PROVERB HAS IT WHY NOT MURPHY MY LORD YOU WILL DO WHAT YOU THINK PROPER I DO WHAT IS JUST SAID RODOLPH WITH AN AIR OF IMPATIENCE
YOU ARE RIGHT,--ALWAYS RIGHT
THESE BLOWS WORTHY OF THE ADMIRATION OF JEM BELCHER DUTCH SAM TOM CRIBB OR ANY OTHER CELEBRATED ENGLISH PUGILIST WERE SO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THE SYSTEM OF THE SAVATE THAT THE CHOURINEUR DROPPED LIKE AN OX ON THE PAVEMENT EXCLAIMING AS HE FELL I'M FLOORED MON LINGE EST LAVE MON DIEU
MIGHT I VENTURE TO SOLICIT THE FAVOUR OF YOUR STEPPING AS FAR AS THE SPIRIT-SHOP KEPT SO CONVENIENTLY AT HAND AND BRING A BOTTLE OF CASSIA AND TWO GLASSES
ALL THE WOMEN WILL BE YOUR SLAVES
RODOLPH IF YOU COULD HAVE ANY WISH YOU LIKED WHAT SHOULD YOU MOST DESIRE OH I SHOULD LIKE TO BE RICH WITH PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND CARRIAGES
THE SERGEANT CHAPTER XX
THOUGH THE KIND LADY WITH WHOM YOU WILL RESIDE BE NOT YOUR AUNT SHE WILL FEEL FOR YOU THE MOST LIVELY AND AFFECTIONATE INTEREST AND WITH THE PERSONAGES ABOUT THE FARM YOU WILL PASS AS BEING REALLY AND TRULY HER NIECE AND THIS INNOCENT DECEPTION WILL RENDER YOUR RESIDENCE HERE MORE AGREEABLE AND ADVANTAGEOUS
WHAT HAVE YOU KEPT IT I HAVE INDEED
WHAT DO YOU SAY,--WILL YOU COME OR NOT ONE MAY TRUST YOU CHOURINEUR
DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH WIDOW OF THE GRAND DUKE CHARLES FREDERIC RODOLPH 21ST APRIL 1785 SEYTON WITH MUCH PRACTICAL GOOD SENSE HAD FIRST NOTED DOWN ON HIS LIST THE YOUNGEST PRINCES WHOM HE COVETED AS BROTHERS-IN-LAW THINKING THAT EXTREME YOUTH IS MORE EASILY SEDUCED THAN RIPENED AGE
A MAN
THEY COULD AFFORD THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK
WHAT YOU HERE YOU BAD LOT
I'M ALL RIGHT
WHY YOU KNOW THAT NOW I NEVER BREAK A HEAD EVEN IF I AM BEGGED TO DO SO OH I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD COST YOU MUCH TROUBLE STRONG AS YOU ARE YET HERE IS MY MASTER SAID THE CHOURINEUR LAYING HIS HAND ON RODOLPH'S SHOULDER
THE LAST PLACE WE ASCERTAINED HE HAD LIVED IN WAS THE RUE DU TEMPLE WHERE HE WAS KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF FRANCOIS GERMAIN
TO BE SURE IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASY TO APPREHEND CECILY AGAIN IF SHE DOES NOT CARRY OUT WHAT HE REQUIRES OF HER
AT ONE O'CLOCK THIS VERY MOMENT WHERE THE ROAD BRANCHES OFF TO ST DENIS AND LA REVOLTE THIS VERY SPOT JUST AS YOU SAY MASTER RODOLPH ON THIS VERY SPOT THE SCHOOLMASTER
IT WAS REQUISITE TO CROSS THE CIRCLE TO REACH THE PLACE WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS SEATED WHO WAS ANXIOUS MOST KINDLY TO DESTROY THE RUMOUR THAT WAS CIRCULATED AND BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF THUS CROSSING THE ROOM CONFOUND HER CALUMNIATORS AND PROVE TRIUMPHANTLY THAT THE FAIR PROPORTIONS OF HER PROTEGEE HAD LOST NOT ONE JOT OF THEIR SYMMETRY AND DELICACY
HE IS A MAN OF COOL AND DECIDED ENERGY WHO SETS BUT LITTLE VALUE ON HIS LIFE
RODOLPH THAT DREAD OFTEN COMES ACROSS ME AND FILLS ME WITH TERROR ALAS
AND WHEN I DID NOT BRING HER IN AT LEAST TEN SOUS THE CHOUETTE BEAT ME INSTEAD OF GIVING ME ANY SUPPER ARE YOU SURE THE WOMAN WAS NOT YOUR MOTHER INQUIRED RODOLPH
AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK TO SEE THE BLUE SKIES AND THE GREEN SHINY LEAVES OF THE NEIGHBOURING FORESTS,--SUCH A DAY AS TO-DAY FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU FEEL HALF INCLINED TO WEEP WITHOUT KNOWING WHY AND BEGIN SINGING OLD AND MELANCHOLY SONGS LIKE GENEVIEVE DE BRABANT DO YOU KNOW GENEVIEVE DE BRABANT M
YOU TOO
PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO WARN US OF SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED,--MAYBE SOME TRAP FOR US
HE MAKES HIMSELF SO VERY DISAGREEABLE AND THEN LAUGHS SO DISGUSTINGLY LOUD AT THE SILLY THINGS HE SAYS
BUT THE POLICE HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME EXCEPT NOW AND THEN FOR A SHINDY FOR WHICH THEY GIVE ME PERHAPS TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AT THE WATCH-HOUSE AND THERE'S AN END OF THAT WHAT DO YOU EARN A DAY THIRTY-FIVE SOUS FOR TAKING IN THE RIVER FOOT-BATHS UP TO THE STOMACH FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HOURS A DAY SUMMER AND WINTER
WHAT'S O'CLOCK HALF PAST TWELVE SAID RODOLPH LOOKING AT HIS WATCH
THIS ROAD IS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER WELL THEN I SAY I SUPPOSE THAT THIS ROAD LEADS TO A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE VILLAGE AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE HIGHROAD OH YES
HOWEVER AFTER A DEAL OF BATTLING WE GOT TWELVE FRANCS A MONTH OUT OF HIM,--A PALTRY PITIFUL TWO-FARTHING CAPTAIN
BUT TREAT IT AS I DO,--ALL SCANDAL AND LIES
TO-MORROW FRIDAY ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK LET THERE BE A GOOD NOT AN OVERFIERCE FIRE LIGHTED IN BOTH ROOMS
THE ENTRANCE TO EACH SEPARATE SET OF APARTMENTS IN THIS HOUSE BORE ITS OWN PECULIAR AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER TO THE OBSERVANT EYE
SARAH WHO WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED MUSICIAN KNOWING THE TASTE OF THE GRAND DUCHESS FOR THE OLD MASTERS AND ABOVE ALL FOR GLUCK SENT FOR THE CHEF-D'OEUVRE OF THIS ATTRACTIVE COMPOSER AND FASCINATED THE OLD PRINCESS BY HER UNFAILING COMPLAISANCE AS WELL AS THE REMARKABLE SKILL WITH WHICH SHE SANG THOSE OLD AIRS SO BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR MELODY SO EXPRESSIVE IN THEIR CHARACTER
YOU WILL NOT OBJECT TO SUCH A METHOD OF AMUSING MYSELF WILL YOU OH NO BUILD AS MANY AS YOU LIKE THEY ARE VERY CHEAPLY RAISED AND VERY EASILY KNOCKED DOWN WHEN YOU ARE TIRED OF THEM
PIPELET WITH MUCH BITTERNESS AND THAT ONE NAMED CABRION
AND YET IT MAY BE NOTHING
OH ALL RIGHT
EVERY BREATH SEEMED TO SPEAK OF THE CLUSTERING PLANTS WHOSE BALMY SWEETNESS FILLED THE ATMOSPHERE
AND THEN ADDED THE DOCTOR HOW ENTIRELY HAVE THE GREATEST MEN OF ALL AGES AND ALL COUNTRIES ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO THE MOST REFINED EPICUREANISM,--FROM ALCIBIADES TO MAURICE OF SAXONY FROM ANTHONY TO THE GREAT CONDE FROM CAESAR TO VENDOME
AND YOU SEE M
BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
WE HAD OUR EYES ON THESE TWO SCOUNDRELS
WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO DO FOR HIM NO NOT QUITE BUT TO MAKE HIM MORE CAREFUL IN FUTURE
THIS FEMALE WAS THE COUNTESS SARAH MACGREGOR
WHICH SEEMS TO SAY TO A MAN GO WHERE I SEND YOU SEE HOW YOU TWO HAVE BEEN SENT HERE
CESAR BRADAMANTI OUR THIRD-FLOOR LODGER SAID TO ME
THE CHOUETTE!--THE ONE-EYED WOMAN AT THIS MOMENT THE SCHOOLMASTER AFTER HAVING EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS IN AN UNDERTONE WITH BARBILLON CAME SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE RODOLPH THE GOUALEUSE AND THE CHOURINEUR WERE SITTING AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO FLEUR-DE-MARIE IN A HOARSE VOICE SAID
WE EASILY GOT ACCESS TO THE SLEEPING-ROOM OF THE PLANTER WHICH WAS LIGHTED ON THE INSIDE BY A SMALL GLASS LAMP
IF WE GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER WHY--BUT LET US NOW TO OUR AFFAIR IN HAND
I AM THE LAD FOR A FIRE AND SO I WENT TO THE PLACE IN AN INSTANT
I DON'T KNOW HOWEVER WHAT TO SAY OF SOME RATHER SLY AND SECRET TRANSACTIONS CARRIED ON IN A SMALL ROOM SHE NEVER ALLOWS ANY ONE TO ENTER EXCEPT M
BUT ADDED RODOLPH WITH AN ACCENT OF MOURNFUL PITY THE TERRIBLE JUDGMENT I AM ABOUT TO PRONOUNCE WILL AT LEAST LEAVE THE FUTURE OPEN TO YOUR EFFORTS FOR PARDON AND FOR PEACE
HE TOLD ME YOU HAD GONE AWAY
I'LL TACKLE WITH THIS SWELL AND THEN THE FAIR LADY MAY THINK ME MORE TO HER FANCY THAN HE IS WITH ONE BOUND RODOLPH LEAPED ON THE TABLE
THEN ROSE UP A CRY SO FULL OF AGONY OF CONVULSIVE IRREPRESSIBLE MISERY,--A CRY AS IF WRUNG FROM A BREAKING HEART OR THE LAST WAIL OF EXPIRING NATURE THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE SEEMED TO RE-ECHO IT
WE WERE HALF ON THE GROUND HALF ON THE BOTTOM STEP OF THE FLIGHT
CERTAINLY TWO LOVERS SEATED IN SOME CORNER OF THIS EDEN COULD CONCEIVE NO GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE ENJOYED ON EARTH THAN THUS DREAMILY TO REST BENEATH THE TREES AND FLOWERS OF THIS TERRESTRIAL PARADISE
A NOSE OF MORE THAN ORDINARY PROPORTIONS HELPING TO COMPLETE THE LIKENESS
A DUNG-HEAP IS TWICE AS GOOD
DEAR LITTLE ROSE-TREE
AND NOW IF THE OGRESS ALLOWS ME TO LEAVE THE CITE SHE MUST HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN ME AND WHEN YOU CAME HERE WAS IT TO BUY FLOWERS OH NO I HAD NO MONEY
SHE IS MUCH ABOUT YOUR HEIGHT AND CAN SUPPLY YOU WITH EVERYTHING YOU REQUIRE
THE CHOUETTE DOUBLE-LOCKED THE DOOR
I HAVE ALREADY A BAD COUGH AH I SEE YOU ALREADY IN THE COLD-MEAT BOX GO ALONG YOU SILLY CHILD YOU DO YOU OFTEN HAVE SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE GOUALEUSE SAID RODOLPH
YOU MEANT TO BEAT THIS POOR GIRL AND I HAVE THRASHED YOU,--THAT'S ALL YOU'RE RIGHT
AT THE SIGHT OF RODOLPH THE PORTERESS INQUIRED IN A SURLY TONE
MY FIRST EMPLOYMENT WAS TO HELP THE KNACKERS TO CUT THE HORSES THROATS AT MONTFAUCON
FIFTEEN SOUS FOR DINNER
THAT DOES NOT RUN AWAY WITH MUCH MONEY
ONCE ESTABLISHED THERE YOU WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE YOUR MEANS BY YOUR LABOUR AND ABILITY BUT RENDER A REAL SERVICE TO YOUR COUNTRY BY YOUR COURAGE
CONFIDING IN HIS ADDRESS AND COURAGE AND TRUSTING TO CHANCE HE SAID TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
WHO BEARS WITH MORE BECOMING DEMEANOUR AN ENAMELLED CROSS AROUND HIS NECK OR MORE MAJESTICALLY COMPORTS HIMSELF WHEN THE KEYS OF OFFICE ARE SUSPENDED FROM HIS SHOULDERS APROPOS BARON
HIS VOICE WAS STIFLED
GOOD DAY GOOD DAY MADAME GEORGES SAID RODOLPH ADVANCING TOWARDS THE INDIVIDUAL SO ADDRESSED YOU SEE I AM PUNCTUAL THEN TURNING TO THE DRIVER AND PUTTING MONEY INTO HIS HAND HE SAID HERE MY FRIEND THERE IS NO FURTHER OCCASION TO DETAIN YOU
RODOLPH WILL PROPOSE TO HIM THE JOB FOR TO-MORROW IT IS TRUE BUT THE DOWNY COVE IS LIKELY ENOUGH TO COME TO-DAY AND LURK ABOUT AND RECONNOITRE THE GROUND AND IF HE IS SUSPICIOUS OF M
A FEMALE OVERWHELMED BY EVERY GRIEF THAT CAN DISTRESS A WIFE AND MOTHER
I DO INDEED
A MINUTE A MINUTE FOURLINE_,--LET ME SAY A WORD
YOU WHO HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN OPEN REVOLT AND CONSTANT ENMITY AGAINST SOCIETY THE RUFFIAN BOWED HIS HEAD AND MADE NO ANSWER
THE CHOURINEUR SAID HE WOULD STRIKE ME BECAUSE I COULD NOT PAY FOR HIS GLASS OF BRANDY
AND SO YOU SEE WHEN I PUT ON AGAIN MY OLD SMOCK-FROCK AND TROUSERS I SHA'N'T LIKE IT
THESE YES AND NO BOTHERED MY BRAIN TREMENDOUSLY
I WAS A BRUTE--A BEAST I KNEW OLD MURPHY THAT YOU WOULD DO JUSTICE TO MY PROTEGEE SAID RODOLPH SMILING AND SHAKING HANDS WITH THE SQUIRE
HIS HEAD NEARLY BALD WAS STILL ORNAMENTED WITH A FRINGE OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AT EACH SIDE WHICH THE HAND OF TIME HAD HERE AND THERE SLIGHTLY TINGED WITH GRAY
RODOLPH BEGAN BY TELLING POLIDORI THAT HE HAD NO TASTE FOR STUDY BUT THAT HE GREATLY PREFERRED THE FREE EXERCISE OF HIS ARMS AND LEGS TO BREATHE THE PURE AIR OF THE FIELDS TO TRAVERSE THE WOODS AND THE MOUNTAINS AND THAT A GOOD HORSE AND A GOOD GUN WERE PREFERABLE TO ALL THE BOOKS IN THE UNIVERSE
HUSH
ON THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING ON WHICH THE VARIOUS EVENTS WE HAVE DESCRIBED HAD PASSED A BRIGHT AUTUMNAL SUN SHONE FROM A PURE SKY
SHE SEEMED WHOLLY ABSORBED IN A DEEP AND MELANCHOLY REVERIE
BUT I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE THE KINDNESS TO SING IT TO ME BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER
THE RESULT OF THIS NARRATIVE WILL INFORM OUR READERS OF THE PARTICULARS OF THE MEETING
TO RETURN TO MADAME D'HARVILLE
THE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION FURNISHED FORTH A NUMEROUS CONTINGENT OF YOUNG PRESUMPTIVE SOVEREIGNS
I THANK YOU FOR HAVING BY ONE WORD CHECKED MY HEADLONG PASSION
BUT WAIT A BIT
AND WHEN THE DIFFERENT LODGERS RETURN HOME ALFRED OR MYSELF TURNS THE BOOT UPSIDE DOWN,--WE SORT THEM OUT AND EVERYBODY GETS HIS OWN SO SAYING THE PORTERESS PROCEEDED TO BREAK THE SEAL OF THE LETTER ADDRESSED TO HER
WHY DIDN'T HE SEND FOR THE ARTILLERY SAID THE CHOURINEUR
SOMETIMES FROM THE MORSELS LEFT OF HER WORK SHE MANAGES A SMALL NIGHTCAP OR GOWN
WHILST A FOURTH HELD UP A MIRROR AS IF TO TEMPT THE YOUNG SEMPSTRESS TO FORSAKE HER WORK FOR THE MORE GRATIFYING VIEW OF HER OWN PRETTY COUNTENANCE
AND I SHALL NOT BE JEALOUS OF MY MAN MY LITTLE FOURLINE A PET WORD FOR ASSASSIN ADDED THE CHOUETTE LAUGHING LOUDLY
LEASTWAYS THAT IS WHAT M
ALFRED SAID MADAME PIPELET WHEN SHE HAD INTRODUCED HER TWO COMPANIONS HERE IS A GENTLEMAN AFTER THE APARTMENT ON THE FOURTH FLOOR AND WE HAVE ONLY BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO DRINK A GLASS OF CORDIAL HE SENT FOR THIS DELICATE ATTENTION WON FOR RODOLPH THE ENTIRE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF THE MELANCHOLY PORTER WHO TOUCHING THE BRIM OF HIS HAT SAID IN A DEEP BASS VOICE WORTHY OF BEING EMPLOYED IN A CATHEDRAL
IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN MEAN IT SERIOUSLY ASKED POOR MADAME D'HARVILLE TRYING TO SMILE
PUT IT ON THE CHAIR WITH YOUR BASKET THE CHOUETTE TOOK OFF HER SHAWL
BEHIND THE CARRIAGE STOOD A TALL POWDERED LACQUEY DRESSED IN A LIVERY OF BLUE TURNED UP WITH YELLOW AND SILVER
THEY WERE SPORTING THE BLUNT WHICH THEY HAD PRIGGED FROM THE TALL GENTLEMAN IN BLACK WHO WANTED TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU
BUT A POOR LITTLE GIRL SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE
WHERE CAN HE HAVE SPRUNG FROM
AT THIS MOMENT OF DESPAIR AND DANGER HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS FOR MURPHY
PEGRIOTTE IS EATING THE BARLEY-SUGAR OH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING SAID THE CHOURINEUR
AND THEY ARE PUTTING TO AND THE MAN LEFT THE GARDEN
I RAN TOWARDS IT AND OPENED THE DOOR AND HAD AS IT WERE A PAIL OF WATER THROWN AT ME
MONSEIGNEUR HAD FREIGHTED A DANISH BRIG AT ST THOMAS'S AND WE VISITED INCOGNITO ALL THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN COAST ALONG WHICH WE WERE SAILING
MURPHY'S DISCRETION WAS FAULTLESS
IF HE ALLOWED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE OF LAYING HANDS ON THE SCHOOLMASTER HE MIGHT NEVER AGAIN LIGHT ON HIM
MURPHY A LITTLE WHILE SINCE AS IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT YOUR TASTE DID NOT LIE THAT WAY I HAVE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT FOR YOU
THESE FRIGHTFUL WORDS ARE ALWAYS RINGING IN MY EARS
FOR IN PRISON I HAD FOOD I WAS NOT BEATEN AND IT WAS A PARADISE AFTER THE COCK-LOFT OF THE CHOUETTE
AT THE RISK OF OPENING ANEW THE BLEEDING WOUNDS OF ALFRED RODOLPH VENTURED TO OBSERVE WHILE POINTING TO THE DOOR OF MLLE
FRANCOIS GERMAIN LIVED FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AT NO
PAGE I
DURING THE STORY OF THE GOUALEUSE WHICH THEY COULD NOT OVERHEAR THEY HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY TALKING IN A VERY LOW TONE THROWING OCCASIONAL HURRIED GLANCES AT THE DOOR
SARAH SEYTON WIDOW OF COUNT MACGREGOR AND AT THIS TIME THIRTY-SIX OR THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WAS OF AN EXCELLENT SCOTCH FAMILY DAUGHTER OF A BARONET AND A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
YOU MORE INHUMAN THAN THE BEAST WHICH PERISHETH HAVE TRAMPLED ON THE TENDER FEELINGS BY WHICH EVEN ANIMALS ARE ACTUATED,--YOU HAVE BEEN THE DESTROYER OF YOUR PARTNER AND YOUR OFFSPRING
SURPRISE JOY AND THE DEEPEST THANKFULNESS MINGLED WITH RESPECT LIT UP HER BEAUTIFUL COUNTENANCE WHILE WITH EYES STREAMING WITH TEARS SHE EXCLAIMED
HAVING CAREFULLY NOTED DOWN ALL THESE PARTICULARS RODOLPH RETURNED TO HIS HOUSE RUE PLUMET DEFERRING TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY HIS VISIT TO THE NOTARY JACQUES FERRAND
RODOLPH THEY SHOULD SO WELL PRESERVE THEIR VERDURE
WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT SAID HE
SPAKE TO THEM OF GOD WHO WATCHES OVER THE BLACK AND THE WHITE MAN WITH AN EQUAL EYE
GOUALEUSE TURNED AROUND SCREAMING WITH ALARM
THE DULL ECHO OF THE VAULT AND THE GURGLING WATERS ALONE REPLIED
IF HE HAS NOT HAD ENOUGH I HAVE MORE READY FOR HIM THE BRIGAND HEARD THESE WORDS
AFTER YOUR LESSON IS CONCLUDED YOU WILL OCCUPY YOURSELF IN HOUSEHOLD MATTERS OR EMBROIDER SOME PRETTY LITTLE ARTICLE OF DRESS FOR YOURSELF
RODOLPH SAW SARAH DAILY AFTER HIS RETURN AND BECAME DESPERATELY ENAMOURED
AND THEN THE ONE-EYED WOMAN SEEING THAT WITH HER ONE EYE SAID THE CHOURINEUR LAUGHING
WE MUST TURN BACK THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE WHO FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS OF THEIR INTENDED VICTIMS RETREATED INTO THE DARK PORCH OF A HOUSE CLOSE AT HAND SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE PERCEIVED BY TOM AND SARAH WHO IN PASSING ALMOST TOUCHED THEM WITH THEIR ELBOWS
GO IT MY HEARTIES I FOUND IT SO GOOD NOT FROM DAINTINESS BUT REAL HUNGER
WHAT GOODS DOES HE SELL BRAS ROUGE
HE AGAIN HESITATED AS THOUGH FEARFUL OF A THOUSAND DANGERS
OPEN THE DOORS,--LET HIM DEPART SAID RODOLPH
I SHOULD BE TIRED OF ALWAYS BEING ALONE FOR I LIKE COMPANY AND HERE I AM WITH MY EQUALS
IN FACT THE DRESS AND WHOLE TOURNURE OF MURPHY EXACTLY ACCORDED WITH THE IDEA OF WHAT IN ENGLAND IS STYLED A GENTLEMAN FARMER NOW THE PERSONAGE WE ARE DESCRIBING THOUGH AN ENGLISH SQUIRE WAS NO FARMER
D'HARVILLE IS NEITHER PEEVISH NOR JEALOUS THEN AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOME MEANS OF BREAKING A CONVERSATION SO PAINFUL TO HER FEELINGS SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED AH
RISE MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE CURE
WHY THE TWO SEEMED CUT OUT FOR EACH OTHER SO YOUNG AND SO GOOD-LOOKING
THIS MAN APPALS ME CRIED RODOLPH WITH HORROR AND HIDING HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS
IF HE BE NOT ON HIS GUARD THOSE MONSTERS WILL MURDER HIM CRIED HE
THE VERDIGRIS ONLY MADE ME THIRSTY
EXACTLY EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN FARTHER THAN THE FLOWER-MARKET FOR THESE SIX WEEKS
OH HE IS ALMOST A SAINT IN THE STRICTNESS OF HIS LIFE
AND YOU MAY JUDGE HOW SACRED MUST BE THE VOW THAT HINDERS ME FROM CONVERSING WITH SO CHARMING A LADY AND STRANGE AND UNACCOUNTABLE AS WAS THIS REPLY I HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO SUBMIT TO IT AND YET I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS DEADLY FEUD HALF IN JEST AND HALF IN EARNEST AS IT IS ORIGINATES IN THE MOST SIMPLE CIRCUMSTANCE
AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME ADDED THE CHOUETTE I HAVE MADE THE TOOL SHARP RODOLPH WITH PERFECT COOLNESS PUT HIS HAND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AND TOOK OUT A DOUBLE-BARRELLED PISTOL WHICH HE SHOWED TO THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THEN PUT INTO HIS POCKET
IN MERCY DO NOT EVEN THAT CONTEMPT OF LIFE WHICH IS SOMETIMES DISPLAYED BY THE GREATEST CRIMINALS SAID RODOLPH WITH DISGUST
BLIND BY HEAVEN GIVE HIM THIS POCKETBOOK DAVID SAID RODOLPH
YOU ARE BRUTAL AND OVERBEARING BECAUSE YOU ARE STRONG
BUT THAT WAS IN THE SPRING
THEN IN PRISON I LEARNED TO SEW
THE MERCY OF GOD IS INEXHAUSTIBLE MY DEAR CHILD AND HE HAS EVINCED IT IN NOT ABANDONING YOU IN MOST SEVERE TRIALS
I HAVE NOTHING BUT WHAT MONSEIGNEUR GIVES ME AND I AM UNABLE TO REPAY AS I COULD WISH ALL THAT I OWE YOU PERSONALLY COME COME M
WHEN IN PRISON ON THE CONTRARY I USED TO DELIGHT IN HELPING TO SING THE MASS
SHE OCCUPIES THE ADJOINING ROOM TO THAT WHICH GERMAIN TENANTED AND WHICH CHAMBER BY THE BY IS STILL VACANT
THE CHOUETTE HAS COME OUT TO RECONNOITRE ABOUT THE HOUSE
JUST THE SAME AS IT TICKLES UP ALFRED'S VANITY TO BE STYLED CONCIERGE INSTEAD OF PORTER
PLAIN WATER ONLY MY GOOD SIR THEN HE MADE ME GO INTO THE ANTECHAMBER,--CARPETED ALL OVER
HER FIRST IMPULSE ON ENTERING MY ROOM WAS TO PROSTRATE HERSELF BEFORE MY CRUCIFIX BECAUSE NOW THANKS TO YOU M
THE GALLEYS WOULD BUT OPEN A FRESH FIELD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR BRUTAL STRENGTH AND VILLAINY WHICH WOULD SOON BE EXERCISED IN ENDEAVOURING TO OBTAIN DOMINATION OVER THE GUILTY OR UNFORTUNATE BEINGS YOU WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH TO RENDER YOURSELF A FRESH OBJECT OF HORROR OR OF DREAD
AND I LATELY SO STRONG AND SO DREADED BY ALL,--LOOK AT ME NOW
THERE SHE SHARED HER BREAD AND STRAW WITH THE POOR LORRAINE WHO WAS CONFINED IN THIS CELLAR OF A POOR LITTLE INFANT
SEE HERE IS A NICE QUIET CORNER WHERE YOU WILL BE IN PERFECT SAFETY FROM THE RESEARCHES OF THOSE WHO ARE LAMENTING YOUR ABSENCE ADDED SARAH PRONOUNCING THE LAST WORDS WITH MARKED EMPHASIS
I NEVER CAN FORGET THEM--THICK AS BUTTONS--WHAT A TORRENT
VIVE LA CHARTE
VIVE LA CHARTE
I HAVE KILLED MY FELLOW CREATURE IN A PASSION
NEVERTHELESS I AM SURE THAT SOME VERY PAINFUL REMINISCENCES WERE AWAKENED IN HIS MIND POOR NEGRO
THE BORDERS OF THE CASES CONTAINING THE ORANGE SAND CAMELLIAS WERE FILLED WITH THE CHOICEST CAPE HEATHS THE TULIPS OF THOL THE NARCISSUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE HYACINTH IRIDES AND CYCLAMINA OF PERSIA
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL US YOUR HISTORY COMRADE RODOLPH ADDED THE CHOURINEUR
IN SPITE OF HIS HORRIBLE NICKNAME HIS FEATURES DID NOT EXPRESS FEROCITY BUT A SORT OF COARSE FAMILIARITY AND IRREPRESSIBLE AUDACITY
I GAVE THE THREE ELEVEN WOUNDS,--YES ELEVEN
THEN THE SCHOOLMASTER AND M
I HAVE SAID THIS HOUSE AND THIS ESTABLISHMENT ARE YOURS IF THEY SUIT YOU FOR THE BARGAIN IS CONDITIONAL
THE HERALDIC DEVICE OF THE COMMINGLED CASQUE AND CROSS MADE RODOLPH SMILE AND CONFIRMED HIM IN THE IDEA THAT THE WRITER OF THE LETTER IN QUESTION WAS NOT A FEMALE
GREAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN OF HER RELY ON ME M
FOR POOR GIRL
FINETTE NIGHT IS COMING ON AND TIME IS PRESSING
OH SAY IT!--THE BAGNE EXCLAIMED THE WRETCHED WOMAN WITH HORROR AND ALMOST FRANTIC AS SHE SPOKE
THE RAIN FALLS IN TORRENTS
RODOLPH,--FOR YOU KNOW ONE LOVES FLOWERS ALTHOUGH ONE HASN'T ANY OF ONE'S OWN,--YOU SEE I FELT GRATEFUL TO IT THAT DEAR ROSE-TREE FOR BLOOMING SO KINDLY FOR ME ALTHOUGH I WAS SO GOUALEUSE BENT HER HEAD AND BLUSHED DEEPLY
I CAN'T INDEED
DURING HIS INFANCY HE HAD BEEN EXTREMELY DELICATE
YOU MUST NOT FIND FAULT WITH THAT SAID CHOURINEUR PUFFING OUT A CLOUD OF TOBACCO-SMOKE
SO JUST PUT YOUR EAR DOWN AND I'LL WHISPER WHAT IT IS PEOPLE SAY ABOUT HIM AND THE OLD WOMAN IN A LOW TONE MUTTERED A FEW WORDS AS RODOLPH INCLINED HIS HEAD
AT LAST THEY TURNED ME OUT OF THE YARD
BRAS ROUGE THIS NAME AND THE REMEMBRANCES SO UNEXPECTEDLY PRESENTED BY IT MADE RODOLPH START
5 A HARLEQUIN IS A COLLECTION OF ODDS AND ENDS OF FISH FLESH AND FOWL AFTER THEY COME FROM TABLE WHICH THE PARISIAN PROVIDING FOR THE CLASS TO WHICH THE CHOURINEUR BELONGS FINDS A PROFITABLE AND POPULAR COMPOSITION
I WISHED TO DRAW YOU HERE BY THE TEMPTATION OF A ROBBERY BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ONLY TEMPTATION THAT COULD AVAIL WITH YOU
BUT DESIROUS ABOVE ALL THINGS OF CURRYING FAVOUR WITH HIS PUPIL AND OF MAKING HIM FORGET MURPHY BY HIS OWN CONCESSION AND COMPLIANCE HE CONCEALED FROM THE GRAND DUKE THE YOUNG PRINCE'S REPUGNANCE FOR STUDY AND BOASTED OF HIS APPLICATION TO AND RAPID PROGRESS IN HIS STUDIES
LET ME HOPE THAT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S VISIT TO THE RUE DU TEMPLE HAS FULLY ANSWERED YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND THAT YOU ARE IN EVERY WAY SATISFIED WITH THE RESEARCHES OF MY AGENT PERFECTLY SO ANSWERED RODOLPH
WHILST WITH HIS OTHER HAND HE GRASPED THE ARM OF SARAH AS IF IN A VICE
PROCEED DAVID
WHAT IS JUST ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN INTERPRETATION WHAT IS JUST BEFORE GOD AND MY OWN CONSCIENCE REPLIED RODOLPH IN A SEVERE TONE
IS THERE IN THE WHOLE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION A MORE ELEGANT FIGURE MORE FLOURISHING AND SPLENDID MOUSTACHES AND A MORE COMPLETE MILITARY FIGURE
BUT LET US HARK BACK I HAD PROPOSED A GLORIOUS JOB TO THE CHOURINEUR WHICH HE AT FIRST ACCEPTED BUT AFTERWARDS REFUSED TO GO ON WITH HE ALWAYS HAD VERY PECULIAR IDEAS BUT WHILST HE REFUSED HE OBSERVED TO ME HE MADE YOU OBSERVE OH DIABLE
NO DOUBT SHE ADDED HE WILL BE VERY ANGRY GREATLY ENRAGED AT FIRST BUT HE LOVES HIS SON SO TENDERLY SO BLINDLY AND HAD FOR HER SARAH SO STRONG AN AFFECTION THAT HIS PATERNAL ANGER WOULD GRADUALLY SUBSIDE AND SHE WOULD AT LAST TAKE IN THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN THE RANK WHICH WAS DUE TO HER SHE MIGHT SAY IN A DOUBLE SENSE BECAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHICH WOULD BE THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE GRAND DUKE
HOWEVER WHEN I GOT TO MY MORSEL OF HORSE'S FLESH I WAS AS HAPPY AS A KING
I SHALL NOT BE HERE OFTEN SAYS HE AND WOULD ALWAYS WRITE YOU A LINE BEFORE COMING TO GIVE YOU TIME TO PREPARE THEM YES COMMANDANT I CAN ANSWERS MY FLATTERER OF AN ALFRED
WHAT SAY YOU TO A CUP OF BRANDY WITH SUGAR IN IT THAT'S THE TICKET SAID THE CHOURINEUR
AH WE ALL HAVE AND HAVE HAD OUR MISERIES YES BUT NOT SUCH MISERIES AS MINE CHOURINEUR SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE
SIX WEEKS SIR REPLIED GOUALEUSE SHUDDERING AS SHE SPOKE
ONE DOES NOT OPEN A DOOR WITH ONE'S BACK AT ALL EVENTS BARON THE COURIER
NEITHER HAD THE DOCTOR FAILED TO PROVE TO RODOLPH THAT A PRINCE OF THE GERMANIC CONFEDERATION SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY MILITARY PRETENSION BEYOND SENDING HIS CONTINGENT TO THE DIET
THAT NEARLY SPOILED ALL AND I SAID TO MYSELF I AM NOW UNDERMOST AND HE AT TOP,--HE'LL KILL ME
SOME FANTASTIC SKETCHES FROM THE PENCIL OF M
WORK WILL COME WHEN THE MONEY IS SPENT AND SO I BEGAN TO SPEND MY TWO HUNDRED FRANCS
NOR WAS IT BELIEVED SHE EVER LAID IT ASIDE WHETHER SLEEPING OR WAKING
I BEGIN AS A BEAST OF BURDEN AND END LIKE A FISH'S TAIL
HE TOLD ME I HAD HEART AND HONOUR,--THAT'S ENOUGH UNFORTUNATELY MY LAD MONSEIGNEUR LEFT WITHOUT GIVING ANY ORDERS ABOUT YOU
WRETCH THAT YOU ARE YOU WOULD DARE TO HOPE
SARAH REQUIRED IN AID OF HER FUTURE PROJECTS TOO MUCH AID NOT TO EMPLOY HER INSINUATING POWERS IN ACQUIRING PARTISANS
I DON'T LIKE EVEN TO THINK OF THAT SAID THE CHOURINEUR AND HE EMPTIED HIS PIPE AT THE CORNER OF THE TABLE
THE DEUCE TAKE YOU MAN
TOO LATE
AT THE FORMIDABLE NOISE CAUSED BY SO MANY FALLING ARTICLES CLATTERING UPON THE HEAD OF THE UNFORTUNATE CAUSE OF ALL THIS DISCORD AND HAVOC THE DOCTOR SPRUNG FROM HIS SEAT WHILE RODOLPH AWAKING WITH A START RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH AN ANXIOUS AND PERTURBED GLANCE THEN PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS BROWS AS THOUGH TRYING TO ARRANGE HIS IDEAS HE INQUIRED
GENERALLY A DIFFICULTY ABOUT MONEY PUTS VERY EVIL THOUGHTS INTO OUR HEAD ALL THAT IS VERY WISE AND VERY SENSIBLE MY FRUGAL LITTLE FRIEND
THEIR DRESS THEIR MANNERS ALL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY NEVER FREQUENTED LOW DRINKING-SHOPS WHILST BY THEIR RESTLESS LOOKS AND DISTURBED COUNTENANCES IT MIGHT BE JUDGED THAT SOME VERY POWERFUL MOTIVES HAD LED THEM HITHER
YOU SEE I PAINTED AFTER NATURE YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT M
IMPOSSIBLE EXCLAIMED HE
ALL RIGHT FLEUR-DE-MARIE HAD NOT HEARD A WORD OF THE LATTER PART OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE CHOURINEUR AND RODOLPH AND NOW ENTERED AGAIN INTO THE COACH WITH HER TRAVELLING COMPANION
QUITE SURE
THERE WAS SOMEBODY HERE ASKING AFTER YOU LAST NIGHT,--A TALL GENT WELL DRESSED AND WITH HIM A YOUNG WOMAN IN MEN'S CLOTHES
BUT I NEVER STOLE FOR FEAR OF A GAOL POOH SAID THE CHOURINEUR SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND LAUGHING LOUDLY I SHOULD THEN NOT HAVE STOLEN BREAD FOR FEAR OF GETTING MY ALLOWANCE EH
ONLY ALL CORRECT ALL RIGHT AND HONOURABLE,--YOU UNDERSTAND
I WOULD LAY A WAGER YOU ARE REGRETTING YOUR POOR ROSE-TREE AND ARE CRYING BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT BRING IT OUT WALKING WITH YOU AS YOU USED TO DO LA GOUALEUSE FELL INTO THE GOOD-NATURED SCHEME FOR REGAINING HER CHEERFULNESS AND BY DEGREES THE CLOUDS OF SADNESS CLEARED AWAY FROM HER FAIR YOUNG FACE
HE INSTANTLY RESOLVED THEREFORE COST WHAT IT MIGHT TO RUIN THE WORTHY ENGLISHMAN IN RODOLPH'S ESTIMATION
WE HAVE SOME BUSINESS TOGETHER THAT'S YOUR AFFAIR,--A SET OF RUFFIANS AS YOU ARE ALTOGETHER RUFFIANS SAID THE MAN MUCH INCENSED
THIS HAD NOT ESCAPED THE SAGACITY OF RODOLPH AND HE AWAITED THE MAN'S RECITAL WITH CURIOSITY
YOU KNOW OUR TIME IS ALL OUR OWN AT THESE WORDS WHICH REMINDED THE POOR GOUALEUSE THAT HER NEWLY TASTED HAPPINESS WAS FAST FLEETING AWAY AND THAT AT THE CLOSE OF THIS THE BRIGHTEST DAY THAT HAD EVER SHONE ON HER EXISTENCE SHE MUST RETURN TO ALL THE HORRORS OF A CORRUPT CITY HER FEELINGS BROKE THROUGH ALL RESTRAINT SHE HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND BURST INTO TEARS
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE CHOURINEUR RODOLPH REMAINED PREOCCUPIED AND PENSIVE WHILE FLEUR-DE-MARIE TOO TIMID TO BREAK THE SILENCE CONTINUED TO GAZE ON HIM WITH SADDENED EARNESTNESS
YOU WILL FIND ME AND THE POCKETBOOK READY
HERE TAKE MY POCKETBOOK AND CONCEAL IT CAREFULLY IN MY WAISTCOAT THAT LA CHOUETTE MAY NOT SEE IT
BECAUSE HUNGER AND MISERY ARE OGRESSES OF THE SAME SORT AS THOSE WHO LAID HANDS ON THE POOR GOUALEUSE
OH THE CHOUETTE
I AM ALL ATTENTION M
AND TO CROWN HER BEAUTY SHE HAD A COPPER COMPLEXION WHICH THE USE OF STRONG LIQUORS HAD MATERIALLY TENDED TO HEIGHTEN
A PRETTY PEASANT'S CAP AND TWO THICK BRAIDS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR ENCIRCLED HER CHARMING FACE
THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS NOT MORE THAN FIVE FEET FOUR OR FIVE
VENGEANCE EXCLAIMED RODOLPH IN A TONE OF CONCENTRATED RAGE
STRUCK WITH A RESERVE SO FULL OF DELICACY I WISHED TO KNOW WHAT SHE FELT
THE BRIGAND NO DOUBT PERCEIVED BY SOME ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGN THAT RODOLPH WAS NOT ASLEEP AND SAID IN A LAUGHING TONE
SHE'LL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU FOR ON MY LIFE SHE WAS MUCH SMITTEN WITH YOU YESTERDAY DO YOU GO AND FETCH HER AND TELL HER I WILL TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY
BESIDES THE DOCTOR WAS TOO CUNNING ALL AT ONCE TO SHOCK CERTAIN NOBLE SENTIMENTS AND CONVICTIONS WHICH RODOLPH HAD DERIVED FROM THE ADMIRABLE LESSONS OF MURPHY
DO YOU PERCEIVE SIR
IN HIS HIDING-PLACE,--NOT MORE THAN TWO PACES FROM THE GARDEN
IN HARVEST-TIME TO OBSERVE THE REAPERS AND AFTERWARDS TO ENJOY THE DELIGHT WITH WHICH THE GLEANERS PICK UP THE SCATTERED EARS OF GRAIN
THEN MONSEIGNEUR WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT WITHOUT THINKING OF YOU WHY M
THEN I HAD MY DREAM ALL OVER AGAIN,--THE SERGEANT AND THOSE POOR YOUNG FELLOWS WHOM I CUT AND STABBED WHO MADE NO DEFENCE AND DIED GIVING ME A LOOK SO GENTLE SO GENTLE THAT THEY SEEMED AS IF THEY PITIED ME
CASTLES IN THE AIR 99 XI
CHAPTER VII
INDIGNANT AT THE MALEVOLENCE OF THESE REMARKS SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID ALOUD FROM THE END OF THE SALOON IN WHICH SHE WAS SITTING
I ACCOMPANIED MONSEIGNEUR IN HIS VOYAGE TO AMERICA WHEN HE RESCUED DAVID AND THE METISSE FROM THE MOST AWFUL FATE YOU ARE ALWAYS MOST KIND MY DEAR MURPHY AND I AM ALL ATTENTION SAID THE BARON
AND WHO DO YOU THINK FOR HIS BEGGARLY TWELVE FRANCS WOULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO ATTEND TO HIS ROOMS,--A STRANGER
YOU FLATTER ME BUT I WILL DO MY BEST SHALL I BRING TWO SHEEP TO THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MASTER ASKED THE JOURNEYMAN
THEN TAKING A BAG WHICH I CARRIED AND WHICH CONTAINED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS IN GOLD HE THREW IT ON THE FELLOW'S BED AND ADDED THIS WILL INDEMNIFY YOU FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR TWO SLAVES,--TO YOUR VIOLENCE THAT DESTROYS I OPPOSE A VIOLENCE THAT SAVES
IN THE OTHER TABLES AND GARDEN CHAIRS WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN PAINTED GREEN
YOU KNOW THE HIGH OPINION I ENTERTAIN OF YOUR ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE AND THAT FROM THE HOUR IN WHICH YOU WERE ATTACHED TO MY HOUSEHOLD YOU HAVE POSSESSED MY MOST UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE,--NEVER FOR ONE INSTANT HAVE I DOUBTED YOUR GREAT SKILL AND PERFECT ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR PROFESSION
IN THE MORNING HEARING A NOISE I HID MYSELF STILL FURTHER BACK IN THE WOOD-PILE
I SHALL REQUIRE FROM YOU NOTHING BUT WHAT IS HONOURABLE
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS NO DOUBT WAS UP THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT MY DEAR MURPHY FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE APPEARS CONSIDERABLE MONSEIGNEUR WENT TO BED AT SIX O'CLOCK THIS MORNING
WHOLLY INDIFFERENT TO FLATTERY YET SENSIBLY ALIVE TO KINDNESS SHE PERFECTLY DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN SYMPATHY AND INSINCERITY
WHY THE FIRST CORNER OF NO-MATTER-WHAT STREET EITHER ON THE RIGHT OR LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE WAY AND EITHER GOING UP OR COMING DOWN THE KENNEL THEN YOU HAVE CURSED YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER FOR HAVING ABANDONED YOU WHY THAT WOULD NOT HAVE SET MY LEG IF I HAD BROKEN IT
RODOLPH SAID GOUALEUSE
BUT I VERY SELDOM DO SO NOW
MERRILL I'LL TELL YOU WHY I PROPOSED THIS ROBBERY TO YOU
SO THEN YOUR PLUCK IS IN YOUR STRENGTH
FOR I MAKE IT A STRICT RULE NEVER TO PRESERVE ANY REMINISCENCES OF MY FRIENDS BUT SUCH AS ARE AGREEABLE AND GRATIFYING YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS FOUND THE SECRET OF BEING HAPPY IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND RENDERING OTHERS SO AT THE SAME TIME REJOINED THE AMBASSADOR SMILING WITH GRATIFIED PRIDE AND PLEASURE AT A CONFERENCE SO CORDIALLY CARRIED ON BEFORE A GATHERING CROWD OF ADMIRING AUDITORS
NO MORE THERE IS REPLIED THE VOICE OF THE CHOURINEUR IN A TONE OF VEXATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
WE ARE GOING DOWN TO THE BLEEDING HEART,--ONLY TWO STEPS FROM HERE
PREPARATIONS
THEN TO THE RUE DE LA VIEILLE DRAPERIE,--COULDN'T FIND MY MAN
DO YOU THINK I HAVE GIVEN YOU BAD MONEY
AH VILLAIN
AT THE MOMENT WHEN RODOLPH WAS SPRINGING AT HIM THE DOOR OF THE TAPIS-FRANC OPENED WITH VIOLENCE AND THE CHARCOAL-MAN OF WHOM WE HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN AND WHO WAS UPWARDS OF SIX FEET HIGH DASHED INTO THE APARTMENT PUSHED THE SCHOOLMASTER ON ONE SIDE RUDELY AND COMING UP TO RODOLPH SAID IN GERMAN IN HIS EAR
AND THAT WILL SPOIL ALL DO YOU THINK SO I AM SURE OF IT BAH
HER FINELY FORMED MOUTH AND RICH RUBY LIPS WERE EXPRESSIVE OF THE HIGHEST DETERMINATION HAUGHTINESS AND PRIDE
FOR PITY'S SAKE SPARE ME
WHAT SAY YOU I AGREE CHOURINEUR
SO PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND OBLIGE ME WITH A LOCK OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR MY NAME IS PIPELET CERTAINLY ANSWERS I
YOU HAVE COMMITTED ANOTHER MURDER
OR THEY SOON FIND THAT IF THEIR REAL CHARACTERS ARE DETECTED THEY ARE UNDONE
YOUNG MAN I HAVE AN IDEA WHICH IS NOT A BAD ONE SAID THE ROBBER
HE CONTEMPLATED RODOLPH WITH RESPECT MINGLED WITH FEAR AND GRATITUDE BUT WAS STILL UNABLE TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT ALL HE HEARD WAS REALITY
GIVE ME THE ADDRESS OF THE SHOP THEY DO NOT MAKE THEM NOW
OH HEAVEN
RODOLPH'S FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE PERSON FROM WHOSE HAND THIS MUTE EVIDENCE OF DEEP WOE HAD FALLEN WITH THE VIEW OF RESTORING IT BUT REFLECTING THAT SUCH A STEP MIGHT BE MISTAKEN FOR IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY HE DETERMINED TO PRESERVE IT CAREFULLY AS THE FIRST LINK IN AN ADVENTURE HE FOUND HIMSELF ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY ENGAGED IN AND FROM WHICH HE AUGURED A PAINFUL AND MELANCHOLY TERMINATION
FILLED WITH COMMISERATION FOR THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD BEFALLEN THE VERY MAN WHO HAD TRIED JUST BEFORE TO KILL YOU YOU EVEN GAVE HIM AN ASYLUM IN YOUR HUMBLE DWELLING,--NO
FARTHER ON STARTED FORTH AND THEN FELL AGAIN IN A SORT OF VARIEGATED AND FLORAL CASCADE IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF THE STALKS OF THE ASCLEPIAS WHOSE LEAVES LARGE UMBELLATED AND IN CLUSTERS OF FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY STAR-SHAPED FLOWERS GREW SO THICKLY SO EVENLY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR BOUQUETS OF PINK ENAMEL SURROUNDED WITH LEAVES OF FINE GREEN PORCELAIN
ACCORDING TO THE CHOURINEUR'S STATEMENT THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD ESCAPED FROM THE BAGNE SIX MONTHS AGO AND HAD SINCE DEFIED ALL SEARCH AFTER HIM BY DISFIGURING HIMSELF AS HE HAD NOW
AS FOR THE CARPETS,--OH YOU NEVER TROD ON THE LIKE OF THEM I'LL BE BOUND
HIS BREECHES OF AN OLIVE GREEN COLOUR CORRESPONDED IN MATERIAL WITH THE GAITERS WHICH PROTECTED HIS STURDY LEGS WITHOUT REACHING ENTIRELY TO THE KNEE BUT ALLOWING THE STRINGS BELONGING TO HIS UPPER GARMENT TO DISPLAY THEMSELVES IN LONG UNSTUDIED BOWS
FINETTE TAKE THE UMBRELLA THE BRIGAND CALLED OUT
THE MEAT CERTAINLY WAS BLOODY AND ALMOST RAW BUT THAT MADE A CHANGE AND YOUR NAME
ALWAYS LITHE AND ACTIVE HE UNDERWENT NOW THE MOST SEVERE FATIGUES HIS ADDRESS ENERGY AND COURAGE SUPPLYING WHAT WAS DEFICIENT IN HIS MUSCULAR POWER
NO SURPRISE OF THE HEART OR OF THE SENSES EVER INTERVENED TO DISTURB THE COLD AND PITILESS CALCULATIONS OF THIS WOMAN,--CRAFTY SELFISH AND AMBITIOUS
THE DRIVER HAD SCARCELY OPENED THE CARRIAGE DOOR WHEN A PREPOSSESSING FEMALE OF MIDDLE AGE DRESSED IN THE STYLE OF WEALTHY LANDHOLDERS ABOUT PARIS AND WHOSE COUNTENANCE THOUGH MELANCHOLY WAS ALSO GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT IN ITS EXPRESSION APPEARED IN THE PORCH AND WITH RESPECTFUL EAGERNESS ADVANCED TO MEET RODOLPH
HOW CAN SHE DO THAT
THIS POLIDORI KNEW
IT BORE ON A SEAL OF RED WAX THE INITIALS C
BUT MY STORY IS A VERY SHORT ONE SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE
WHO ARE YOU THEN I'LL TELL YOU BY AND BY THAT'S ENOUGH MASTER
RODOLPH SLANG SAID THOMAS SEYTON LOOKING AT SARAH WITH AN ASTONISHED AIR
SHE WORE ON HER CAP A LARGE RED AND YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF
AND AFTER THAT I WENT TO LIE DOWN ON SOME STRAW SPREAD ON THE GROUND
BOURDON
I AM DELIGHTED SAID RODOLPH WITH THE VERY FAVOURABLE ACCOUNTS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM MADAME GEORGES RESPECTING MY POOR LITTLE PROTEGEE AT THE FARM OF BOUQUEVAL
THEN WHAT EXTREME TALENT HE POSSESSES
WELL I DID NOT MAKE THE LEAST REPLY BUT ALMOST KEEPING IN MY BREATH I WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF THIS STRANGE RECEPTION
TO TAKE OUT ONE OF MY TEETH THE CHOURINEUR UTTERED A BLASPHEMOUS OATH ACCOMPANIED WITH SUCH FURIOUS IMPRECATIONS THAT ALL THE GUESTS IN THE TAPIS-FRANC LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
BUT YOU HAVE SOME TRADE BESIDES POLISHING OFF THE CHOURINEUR I AM A FAN-PAINTER AND MY NAME IS RODOLPH A FAN-PAINTER
STEAL HIS LOGS AND YOU ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLD
MY LORD SAID THE CHOURINEUR STARTING UP SUDDENLY YOU OFFER ME THIS HOUSE AND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY,--TO TEMPT ME
BUT I SUPPOSE THE M
HE MAKES NO MYSTERY OF IT
WHY FOR THE VERY REASON THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER WILL DEFEND HER I WILL DOUBLE HER DOSE LISTEN MY MAN TO ME
BUT THE GALLERY IS SO VERY HOT IT GAVE ME A VIOLENT HEADACHE
EACH HIS PROPER PUNISHMENT
BUT NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN HE HOW TO INSPIRE HIS PUPIL WITH THE FEELING OF WHAT IS JUST LOYAL AND GENEROUS AND A HORROR OF EVERY THING THAT WAS MEAN LOW AND CONTEMPTIBLE
SARAH AND TOM LEFT THE TAVERN IN SPITE OF THE TEMPEST AND TOOK A CONTRARY DIRECTION TO THE CHOURINEUR
TELL ME PRAY WHY YOU STYLE THEM SO INSTEAD OF REPLYING M
THE SCOTCH MAIDEN WAS TOO AMBITIOUS TOO SELF-POSSESSED TO COMPROMISE AND BETRAY HERSELF IN THE EYES OF THE COURT
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO CIRCUMSTANCED THAT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHOULD HAVE TO BID ME HOLD MY TONGUE AND I HOPE I SHALL NOT NOW BE ORDERED TO SPEAK WHEN I SHOULD BE SILENT SAID MURPHY PROUDLY
I HAVE QUITE DONE WITH THE MAN AND THEREFORE DISMISSED HIM BUT THE OGRESS WHAT OF HER
THE SOLES OF MY FEET ARE HARD AS IRON
ONE THING HOWEVER IS CERTAIN
THE RUFFIAN HAD LAID ASIDE HIS RAGGED GARMENTS AND HIS AIR OF BRUTAL FEROCITY
SAD OLD REPROBATE TO MAKE ME CHATTER THUS
A WORN-OUT SMALL ORANGE-COLOURED SHAWL WITH GREEN FRINGE WAS CROSSED OVER HER BOSOM
EXCUSE ME YOUNG MAN BUT THE MOTION OF THE COACH ALWAYS PRODUCES A SINGULAR EFFECT ON ME,--IT SENDS ME OFF TO SLEEP LIKE A CHILD THE RUFFIAN UNDER THE GUISE OF ASSUMED SLEEP THOUGHT TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF HIS COMPANION BETRAYED ANY EMOTION
RODOLPH FOR PITY'S SAKE DECEIVE ME NOT
BEGONE BAWLED OUT THE COMMANDANT
HE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED AT MY QUESTION TO GIVE ME A CLEAR ANSWER RODOLPH BIT HIS LIPS IMPERCEPTIBLY AND REPLIED SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
AND OH HOW HAPPY SHE WAS POOR LORRAINE WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A BED WITH HER BABE BESIDE HER IN A LITTLE COUCH WHICH I HAD BOUGHT FOR HER
THEN I HAD MY HOUSE IN PARIS AND IN THE COUNTRY
RIGOLETTE IS AS MERRY AS A KITTEN SHE IS AS PRUDENT AND CORRECT AS I AM MYSELF
WHY IT IS REALLY RIDICULOUS TO HEAR YOU TALK OF ENVYING HER THE GOUALEUSE DID NOT REPLY
STUNNED BY HIS HORRIBLE FALL RODOLPH LAY SENSELESS AND MOTIONLESS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS DOWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN HURLED
BUT TO COME TO THE END OF MY STORY
BE IT SO THEN
ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER I ONLY HAD ON A LITTLE COTTON GOWN NO STOCKINGS NO SHIFT AND WITH WOODEN SHOES ON MY FEET
GEROLSTEIN
AND THEN IN WINTER I HAD WHITE SHEETS,--THAT IS WHENEVER THE SNOW FELL A MAN IS STRONGER
HE WAS EVIDENTLY QUITE AT HOME IN THE TAPIS-FRANC AND IN LANGUAGE FAMILIAR TO ALL THE GUESTS REQUESTED TO BE SUPPLIED WITH SUPPER
AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE WHERE THAT GENTLEMAN SITS IF HE WILL PERMIT ADDED THOMAS WHO WITH SARAH SEATED THEMSELVES BESIDE THE CHOURINEUR WHO WAS AS MUCH ASTONISHED AS FLATTERED BY SUCH POLITENESS
I WANT TO FINISH DESCRIBING THE HOUSE TO YOU
AND NOW FOR THE DANCE I PROMISED YOU NO IT IS YOU WHO SHALL DANCE WAS UTTERED BY A MASCULINE AND DEEP VOICE
YOU HAVE REGULARLY SERVED ME OUT,--YOU ARE A LAD OF METTLE SAID THE CHOURINEUR IN A COARSE TONE BUT STILL WITH THAT SORT OF DEFERENCE WHICH PHYSICAL SUPERIORITY ALWAYS FINDS IN PERSONS OF HIS GRADE
OVERJOYED AT THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ESCAPING THE METISSE WILL FOLLOW HER SUPPOSED RAVISHER AND REACH PARIS
THE INDUSTRIOUS AND CIVIL JOURNEYMAN THAT YOU SAW IN THE SHOP SUPPLIES HIS PLACE WITH MUCH CAPABILITY WHEN HE GOES TO THE FAIRS TO PURCHASE CATTLE
IN FACT HE HAD TOLD US HIMSELF AND THE MEDICAL MAN OF MONSEIGNEUR DECLARED IT IN A PROCES VERBAL THAT THE TWO SLAVES COULD NOT HAVE LIVED EIGHT DAYS LONGER IN THIS FRIGHTFUL DUNGEON
HE DID NOT CEASE SMOKING FOR A MOMENT UNLESS IT WAS TO DRINK FROM A CANNIKIN OF BRANDY PLACED BEFORE HIM
WHAT IS THE USE OF REITERATING WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
AND THAT THEY MIGHT CORRESPOND MORE SURELY AND SECRETLY THEY AGREED UPON A CIPHER OF WHICH POLIDORI ALSO HELD THE KEY
TELL ME M
THE YOUTH HEADLONG LOVE AND INEXPERIENCE OF THE PRINCE WHO WAS HARDLY MORE THAN A CHILD AND SO PERFIDIOUSLY ENSNARED INTO AN INEXTRICABLE POSITION HARDLY EXCITED AN INTEREST IN THE MIND OF THIS SELFISH CREATURE
AH I'VE FOUND YOU OUT YOU SEE,--PRETTY GIRL WELL I THINK YOU HAVE DISCOVERED MY INTENTIONS SO I WILL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I MEAN TO TRY AND BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MY AGREEABLE NEIGHBOUR THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT SIR,--IT IS CUSTOMARY
BUT LO AND BEHOLD
BUT PREVIOUSLY TO VIEWING THE LODGING I AM ANXIOUS TO TAKE I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER YOU MADAME COULD DO ME THE FAVOUR TO TAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF MY LITTLE HOUSEKEEPING OFF MY HANDS
THIS PROPOSITION WAS RECEIVED BY THE YOUTH WITH WELL-MERITED INDIGNATION BUT UNWILLING TO DENOUNCE THE MAN BY WHOM HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP HE FIRST COMMUNICATED ANONYMOUSLY TO HIS MASTER THE DESIGNS PROJECTED AGAINST THE BANK AND THEN PRIVATELY QUITTED NANTES THAT HE MIGHT AVOID THE RAGE AND FURY OF THOSE WHOSE SINFUL PRACTICES HIS SOUL SICKENED AND SHUDDERED TO THINK OF FAR LESS TO BEAR THE IDEA OF PARTICIPATING IN
WE ARE BUT POOR OURSELVES
ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING M
THEY DRANK MY BEST WINE ALONG WITH THE CHOURINEUR OH WITH THE CHOURINEUR DID THEY
I TOOK A SECOND TURN AND THEN SHE SCREECHED OUT AT BRAS ROUGE'S IN THE VAULT AT THE BLEEDING HEART ALL RIGHT
THIS HOUSE AND PROPERTY ARE HIS WITHOUT COUNTING A THOUSAND CROWNS IN HAND TO CARRY ON HIS BUSINESS WITH
BECAUSE SHE MAY NEVER COME BACK AGAIN
LET US CHANGE THE CONVERSATION
IF I GIVE YOU ALL I HAVE I SHALL CHEAT THE POOR WHO OUGHT TO GET SOME ALMS OUT OF ME WELL THEN MY FINE FELLOW I'LL KEEP MY THINGS AND GOUALEUSE SHA'N'T GO OUT
SINCE MY PREDECESSOR M
AND FORTHWITH HE READ WHAT FOLLOWS WRITTEN UPON HOT-PRESSED PAPER STAMPED IN ITS RIGHT-HAND CORNER WITH THE HELMET THE LETTERS C
I REPLIED THAT'S THE VERY THING FOR ME M
THEY SAY HE BRAGS OF HAVING ALREADY WITH HER ASSISTANCE DONE FOR TWO OR THREE PERSONS
ALTHOUGH HE WAS POWERFUL AND WELL ARMED YET HE HAD TO DEAL WITH AN UNSCRUPULOUS ASSASSIN CAPABLE OF ANY AND EVERY THING
I HAD THOUGHT THAT MY REPENTANCE--MY DEEP REMORSE--AND YET IT IS YOU--YOU RODOLPH COULD NOT FINISH
AND WHO NOW IS THE PERSON FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO POSSESS SUCH A PATTERN OF A LODGER AS THIS M
WHETHER HE LIVES OR DIES IT IS NO MATTER TO YOU
SEEING MURPHY DISGUISED AS A CHARCOAL-SELLER KEEPING WATCH ABOUT THIS CABARET AND CONSTANTLY PEEPING THROUGH THE WINDOWS HE WAS AFRAID THAT SOMETHING WRONG WAS GOING ON AND SO CAME TO WARN US
I SHOULD SPOIL THE FURNITURE THEN SIT DOWN ON THE GROUND I SHOULD SOIL THE CARPET DO WHAT YOU LIKE BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BE QUIET SAID THE DOCTOR IN A TONE OF IMPATIENCE
MR WILLIS DEEPLY EXASPERATED AFFECTED TO DISCOVER IN THIS MANIFESTATION THE APPEARANCE OF REVOLT AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE WHICH DAVID HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE SLAVES HE BELIEVED HIM CAPABLE OF PLACING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A REBELLION TO AVENGE HIMSELF OF HIS WRONGS
BUT THEN AS FOR VISITING YOUR GREAT DONS IN THIS KIND OF WAY I NEVER COULD HAVE DONE SUCH A THING
A LAMP PLACED ON A NEIGHBOURING TABLE DIFFUSED A STRONG CLEAR LIGHT
SPITE OF THE TRIFLING EMBONPOINT THAT GAVE TO HER FIGURE WHICH THOUGH FATTER THAN MADAME D'HARVILLE'S WAS NOT LESS SLENDER AND NYMPH-LIKE A VOLUPTUOUS GRACEFULNESS SARAH BOASTED OF ALL THE FRESHNESS OF EARLY YOUTH AND FEW COULD LONG SUSTAIN THE FIRE OF HER BLACK AND PIERCING EYES
HE DESTROYED THE PAINTING OF THE DOOR BY DAUBING IT OVER WITH A PARCEL OF FAT INDECENT CHILDREN HE CALLED HIS LOVES
YESTERDAY BY A REMARKABLE REVELATION I DISCOVERED THAT YOU ARE ANSELM DURESNEL IT'S FALSE
FIELDS
THEN I WENT SOFTLY UP-STAIRS WITH ONLY MY LIST SLIPPERS ON
AT LENGTH I GOT EMPLOYMENT IN THE QUARRIES AT MONTROUGE
LET US SPEAK OF OTHER MATTERS WHY I DON'T KNOW BUT AS YOU ARE TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE IT IS ONLY FAIR AND RIGHT TO PREPARE YOU FOR ANY FALSEHOODS YOU MAY HEAR
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF FOR HE IS THE CHOURINEUR IF HE BE THE CHOURINEUR I AM A BULLY BOY WHO NEVER KNUCKLES DOWN EXCLAIMED THE UNKNOWN
SARAH DID NOT UTTER A CRY NOR TRY TO RESIST
HOLD YOUR TONGUE
I HAD NOTHING TO TELL THEM BECAUSE YOU HAD COMMUNICATED NOTHING TO ME EXCEPT THOSE FISTICUFFS WHICH SETTLED ME
YET SOMETIMES IN SPITE OF MYSELF I SLEPT AS I STOOD,--BUT NOT LONG
BUT HOW MY NOBLE FELLOW WERE YOU ABLE TO ARRIVE HERE IN TIME SAID RODOLPH TO THE CHOURINEUR
BUT DIRECTED BY SEYTON AND THE DOCTOR THE YOUNG COUPLE MANAGED SO WELL AND OBSERVED SO MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT THEY ELUDED ALL DETECTION
BEFORE MY DEPARTURE WE WILL HAVE SOME TALK TOGETHER AND THEN I SHALL QUIT YOU MOST HAPPY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR FULL CONTENTMENT FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITHOUT ONE WORD OF REPLY GRACEFULLY BENT HER KNEE AND BEFORE RODOLPH COULD PREVENT HER GENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY RAISED HIS HAND TO HER LIPS
HE COULD NEVER BE HAPPY
NO FOR MANY REASONS
YOUR SERVANT YOUNG MAN
THE FIRST STATE OF THE GERMAN CONFEDERATION WHICH HEADED SARAH'S ROAD-BOOK WAS THE GRAND DUCHY OF GEROLSTEIN THUS STYLED IN THE DIPLOMATIC AND INFALLIBLE ALMANACH DE GOTHA FOR THE YEAR OF GRACE 1819
THE MOMENT IS COME TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE I DO NOT HESITATE MY LORD
LET ME SEE HIM AND RODOLPH ENDEAVOURED TO RISE BUT FELL BACK AGAIN OVERCOME BY WEAKNESS AND THE INTENSE PAIN HE FELT FROM HIS MANY AND SEVERE CONTUSIONS
HIS COUNTENANCE WAS EXPRESSIVE OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE AND HIS CARRIAGE WAS DISTINGUE
THUNDER
THUNDER
I AWAIT YOU HERE I WON'T BE LONG
RODOLPH SAID GOUALEUSE SINCE MADAME GIVES ME LEAVE YES YES YOU MAY GO MY LITTLE DUCK BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD GAL
BOSTON EDITION DE LUXE LIMITED TO ONE THOUSAND COPIES NO
THE ISLE-ADAM
YOU KNOW WELL THAT IT IS A LONG WAY FROM THE HEART TO THE LIPS AS THE GOOD PEOPLE AT HOME SAY
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THE COMMANDANT KEPT HUGGING ME UP THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE BRUTE PUSHED ME AWAY EXCLAIMING WITH AS MUCH DISGUST AS THOUGH HE HAD TOUCHED A TOAD WHO THE DEVIL ARE YOU ME COMMANDANT,--THE PORTERESS,--MADAME PIPELET
HE FOUND A PRIEST,--WITNESSES
I SOON MADE OUT THAT HE WAS PARLEYING WITH THE TALL MAN WHO CAME INTO THE TAPIS-FRANC WITH THE LITTLE WOMAN DRESSED IN MAN'S CLOTHES THEY IN CONFERENCE WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE SAID RODOLPH WITH AMAZEMENT
YOU MUST COMPLAIN TO THE LANDLORD WHAT IS HIS NAME THE LANDLORD OF THE BLEEDING HEART YES WHAT IS THAT TO YOU
HER BOSOM THROBBED UNDER HER WORN-OUT LITTLE ORANGE SHAWL AND SHE PLACED ONE OF HER HANDS UPON HER HEART AS IF TO RESTRAIN ITS QUICKENED PULSATION WHILST WITH THE OTHER HAND SHE PROFFERED TO RODOLPH THE BOUQUET OF FIELD FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD JUST GATHERED
THE DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS OF THE APPROACH SERVED AS A SORT OF PENUMBRA IN WHICH WERE INDISTINCTLY TRACED OUT THE GIGANTIC EXOTICS DISCERNIBLE THROUGH A SPECIES OF ARCH PARTLY CONCEALED BY TWO CRIMSON VELVET CURTAINS LOOPED BACK WITH GOLDEN CORDS SO AS TO GIVE A DIM AND MISTY VIEW OF THE ENCHANTED LAND THAT LAY BEYOND
AH I SEE AND SHE LOOKED AT ME MALICIOUSLY WITH HER ONE GREEN EYE
RODOLPH WHAT A COUNTENANCE!--HE WHO LOOKED SO MILD AND GENTLE
WELL SHE LENDS TEN SOUS UPON CONDITION OF BEING PAID TWENTY AT THE END OF THE WEEK OTHERWISE SHE KEEPS THE SHIRT FOR EVER
SO FAR SO GOOD
WHEN WITH MY LARGE AND WELL-WHETTED KNIFE IN MY HAND I HAD ABOUT ME FIFTEEN OR TWENTY HORSES WAITING THEIR TURN BY JUPITER
HE HARDLY DARED TO TOUCH THE HAND TENDERED TO HIM
HE FELT THAT THE THREAD OF HIS IDEAS HAD ESCAPED HIM
RASCAL
LET US FORGET IT AND RETURN TO OUR FORMER CONVERSATION
BUT I WILL NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU THIS ESTATE IS SITUATED ON THE BOUNDARIES OF THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS,--THAT IS NEAR THE OUTPOSTS AND EXPOSED TO THE FREQUENT ATTACKS OF THE ARABS AND ONE MUST BE AS MUCH OF A SOLDIER AS A HUSBANDMAN
FORGIVE ME MY LORD SAID THE CHOURINEUR IN A FALTERING VOICE
NOTHING CAN BE BETTER
NOTHING CAN BE BETTER
AND IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE GOUALEUSE HE ROSE FROM THE TABLE
TONNERRE I--I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIM
AND HE ONLY GIVES THIS POOR THING WHO SLAVES HERSELF TO DEATH FOR HIM EIGHTEEN FRANCS A MONTH,--NOT A FARTHING MORE I GIVE YOU MY WORD
MY HISTORY IS TOLD NOW IT'S YOUR TURN GOUALEUSE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
RODOLPH SAID THE CHOURINEUR IN A CHEERFUL VOICE
BUT THEN HIS HEART IS AS HARD AS IRON AND AS STERN AND RIGID TOWARDS OTHERS AS HE IS SEVERE TOWARDS HIMSELF
CHAPTER XI
THIS DUNGEON WAS SITUATED AS WELL AS THE HOUSE ON THE SEASHORE
AT THIS MOMENT THE MONSTER-VISAGE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER APPEARED AT THE OPENING OF THE TRAP
WHILE THE BED OF RODOLPH SHADED BY THICK CURTAINS OF GREEN DAMASK REMAINED PROTECTED FROM THE GLARE AND IN THE SHADOW OF ITS DEEP RECESS
AFTER LONG AND PERSEVERING INQUIRIES THEY SUCCEEDED IN DISCOVERING HIS ADDRESS BUT HAPPILY FOR THE PERSECUTED OBJECT OF THEIR SEARCH HE HAD A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY ENCOUNTERED THE VILLAIN WHO HAD FIRST SOUGHT TO CORRUPT HIS PRINCIPLES AND WELL DIVINING THE MOTIVE WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM TO PARIS LOST NO TIME IN CHANGING HIS ABODE
AND I HAVE ANOTHER PROOF OF HOW NATURAL AND POTENT IS THIS RELIGIOUS INSTINCT IN HER
I'M HALF THROTTLED AND ONE EYE IS CLOSED,--THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY
WHEN I FELT ITS BLOOD SPRING INTO MY FACE,--HOT BLOOD WHICH SEEMED AS COMING FROM A LIVING THING
MURPHY THEN GAVE TO RODOLPH IF WE MAY USE THE EXPRESSION HEALTH TO BOTH BODY AND MIND
BUT THE RIGIDLY AUSTERE AND SELF-DENYING LIFE OF THIS WORTHY MAN GIVES A FLAT DENIAL TO ALL SUCH GOSSIPING REPORTS AND SPITE OF THE INCREDULITY WITH WHICH HE IS OCCASIONALLY LISTENED TO HE PERSISTS IN STYLING HIMSELF A MAN STRUGGLING FOR A MAINTENANCE
I WILL MAKE A NOISE PURPOSELY IN LOCKING THE DOOR
AT ANY RATE IF THE LADY EVER COMES IN REALITY I WILL LET MY FRIEND THE OYSTER-WOMAN NEXT DOOR KNOW
THUS WHEN THE DOCTOR PROPOSED THAT HE MUST NEVER SEE HIS ENCHANTRESS AGAIN OR POSSESS HER BY A SECRET MARRIAGE RODOLPH THREW HIMSELF ON POLIDORI'S NECK CALLED HIM HIS SAVIOUR HIS FRIEND HIS FATHER
AND BESIDES I SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT TENACIOUS OF INTRODUCING STRANGERS INTO THE HOUSE UNTIL I KNEW WHETHER YOUR ORDERS OF YESTERDAY BUT HOW HAS ALL THIS HAPPENED SAID RODOLPH INTERRUPTING THE BLACK
THAT IS TO SAY WITHOUT THE SENSE OF COLD HUNGER OR THIRST
IF NEVER I SHALL HAVE MY SUSPICIONS OF YOU CONFIRMED AND ONE DAY OR OTHER I WILL TAKE CARE AND LET YOU DINE OFF A DISH OF MY COOKING AND I WILL RETURN YOUR COMPLIMENT RELY ON IT OH THIS IS ALL STUFF AND NONSENSE SAID THE CHOUETTE
TOM AND SARAH 302 XXVI
A POOR MAN LIKE ME CANNOT MAKE FINE SPEECHES BUT ONCE MORE INDEED ON MY WORD I THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE HAVE TIME THEN
HOW COMPLETELY ARE YOU REMINDED WHILE GAZING ON HIS TALL AND FINELY PROPORTIONED FIGURE OF THE PREUX CHEVALIERS OF BYGONE DAYS,'_SANS PEUR ET SANS REPROCHE I ONCE SAW HIM DRESSED IN HIS UNIFORM AS COMMANDANT OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND HANDSOME AS HE IS I REALLY THINK HE LOOKED SURPASSINGLY WELL AND I COULD BUT SAY TO MYSELF THAT IF NOBILITY WERE THE AWARD OF INWARD MERIT AND EXTERNAL BEAUTY M
HER DEEP VOICE HER ENORMOUS ARMS AND COARSE HANDS BETOKENED UNCOMMON STRENGTH
DRIVE TO THE PLACE DE LA MADELAINE RODOLPH LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
KILL FOR PITY'S SAKE AND SAVE ME FROM BEING CRUSHED BENEATH THE FIRST VEHICLE I ENCOUNTER NO
I PULLS UP THE STRING,--SOMEBODY WALKS UP TO MY DOOR HOW DO YOU DO PORTER SAYS A VOICE
WELL SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
RODOLPH I FEEL THAT I AM BEHAVING VERY ILL AND UNGRATEFULLY TOWARDS YOU WHO SO KINDLY BROUGHT ME OUT TO AMUSE ME AND GIVE ME PLEASURE
THIS MAN A LIBERATED CONVICT HAD BEEN SO NAMED AT THE HULKS
YOU WON'T COME INTO MY CLUTCH AGAIN EH
WELL THE EVENING PASSED
I SHOULD BE GUILTY AS YOU ARE WERE I IN PUNISHING YOU TO SEEK ONLY FOR VENGEANCE JUST AS IS MY RIGHT TO DEMAND IT
TO-DAY ONLY PREVENT HER FROM SPEAKING TO THE TALL MAN
IF THEY SEEK TO TRACK US HEREAFTER THE DEPOSITION OF THE COACHMAN WILL NOT BE OF THE SLIGHTEST SERVICE TO THEM AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE COACH WAS APPROACHING THE BARRIER A TALL MAN CLOTHED IN A LONG WHITE RIDING-COAT WITH HIS HAT DRAWN OVER HIS EYES AND WHOSE COMPLEXION APPEARED OF A DEEP BROWN PASSED RAPIDLY ALONG THE ROAD STOOPING OVER THE NECK OF A HIGH SPLENDID HUNTER WHICH TROTTED WITH EXTRAORDINARY SPEED
THE HANDKERCHIEF WAS LITERALLY SOAKED IN TEARS
IN THE EVENING BEFORE GOING TO THE BRIDGE THE CHOUETTE SAVAGE BECAUSE I HAD NOT BROUGHT IN ANYTHING THE EVENING BEFORE INSTEAD OF BEATING ME AS USUAL TO MAKE ME CRY MADE ME BLEED BY PULLING MY HAIR FROM THE SIDES OF THE TEMPLES WHERE IT IS MOST TENDER TONNERRE THAT WAS COMING IT TOO STRONG SAID THE BANDIT STRIKING HIS FIST HEAVILY ON THE TABLE AND FROWNING STERNLY
BUT THE YOUNG MARQUISE SEDUCED BY THE HYPOCRITICAL FLATTERIES OF THE COUNTESS HAS GONE SOMEWHAT COUNTER TO THE MARQUIS'S REQUEST
BUT MUM ADDED SHE FEARING TO HAVE REVEALED TOO MUCH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE WONDROUS EFFECT PRODUCED BY THIS RICH DISPLAY OF TROPICAL VEGETATION IN THE MIDST OF A EUROPEAN WINTER AND ALMOST IN THE VERY CENTRE OF A BALLROOM
THE GIDDINESS ARISING FROM HIS FALL SUBSIDED BY DEGREES AND AS HE BECAME ABLE TO EXTEND HIS LIMBS HE FOUND TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT THOUGH SEVERELY SHAKEN AND CONTUSED NO BONES WERE BROKEN
D'HARVILLE'S DEEP MELANCHOLY
BUT YOU DO NOT SPEAK AS YOU DID YESTERDAY
WHY THERE IS NO OTHER LEFT THE CHOURINEUR TURNING QUICKLY AROUND UPON HIS HEELS AFTER HIS OLD MILITARY FASHION CRUSHED THE FRAGMENTS OF GLASS WHICH LAY ON THE CARPET BENEATH HIS FEET
TO PINCH YOU SAID THE CHOURINEUR
I FORGOT TO SAY THAT AFTER HAVING MALTREATED THE GIRL HE HAD THROWN HER INTO A DUNGEON ALSO AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HER DISDAIN OF HIM
PRAY DO NOT LET HER SEE ME,--I CANNOT VENTURE TO APPROACH HER AND WHY MY CHILD TRUE M
I OUGHT FIRST TO HAVE GOT MY WORK
WELL WHAT AILS YOU I FAITH I DON'T KNOW REPLIED THE CHOURINEUR IN A TONE OF EMOTION
TO GERMANY THEN IT WAS RESOLVED TO BEND THEIR STEPS IN ORDER TO COMMENCE THIS SEARCH FOR THE ROYAL SPOUSE
HE UNITES ALL,--BIRTH FORTUNE WIT YOUTH
PUT YOUR FOOT ON THEM AND YOU'D FANCY YOU WAS STEPPING ON VELVET AND TAKE IT OFF AGAIN FOR FEAR OF SPOILING IT
IT'S NO MATTER TO ME
THEN ALL WAS AGAIN STILL AS DEATH
FORTUNATELY OUR HACKNEY-COACH IS AT THE END OF THE STREET
NO THIS CABRION HAD THE ROOM BEFORE HE CAME
WHICH IN SPITE OF HIS ENERGETIC EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT GROANED BENEATH HIS PONDEROUS LIMBS AS THEY MOVED TOWARDS THE DESIRED SPOT
THE CHOUETTE COULD NOT REPRESS AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AT THE SIGHT OF HIS GHASTLY SEAMED MUTILATED AND FEARFUL FACE WITH EYES THAT GLEAMED LIKE PHOSPHORUS AND SEEMED TO GLARE ON THE GROUND EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THE DARKNESS WHICH THE LIGHTED TAPER COULD NOT ENTIRELY DISSIPATE
SHE WOULD HAVE ME TAKEN UP AS A THIEF
AND REMEMBER TOO TO BE RICH IMPLIES THAT WE SHOULD GIVE MUCH AWAY
IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO SAY THAT THE PRESUMPTIVE HEIR OF THE GRAND DUCHY OF GEROLSTEIN WAS GUSTAVUS RODOLPH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU TO DESCRIBE THE SPONTANEOUS AND NATURALLY RELIGIOUS FEELING THAT EVIDENTLY DICTATED THIS
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME IF I WERE TO FALL ILL AND BE UNABLE TO EARN MY DAILY BREAD,--FOR I NEED SCARCELY TELL YOU I LIVE BUT FROM DAY TO DAY AND SPEND MY MONEY QUITE AS FAST AS I OBTAIN IT OH BUT THAT IS WRONG M
BUT HE COULD NOT
THIS POOR GIRL WILL GREATLY INTEREST YOU HER DISPOSITION IS SO EXCELLENT HER INSTINCTS SO RIGHT WHAT HAS BESIDES AFFECTED ME M
NOW THIS IS AS TRUE A DESCRIPTION AS I CAN GIVE YOU OF HIM
YOU UNDERSTAND
THEN THE DEFENDER OF LA GOUALEUSE SUDDENLY ALTERING HIS MODE OF ATTACK RAINED ON THE HEAD AND FACE OF THE BANDIT A SHOWER OF BLOWS WITH HIS CLOSED FIST AS HARD AND HEAVY AS IF STRICKEN BY A STEEL GAUNTLET
MY HEART BEAT BUT IT WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE
HOW DID YOU GET AWAY FROM THE TIMBER-YARD NEXT DAY ABOUT NOON I HEARD A GREAT DOG BARKING UNDER THE WOOD-PILE
GO FIRST TORTILLARD THE ONE-EYED HAG AND THE LITTLE CRIPPLE WENT UP THE SLIPPERY STEPS
BUT IT SEEMS THAT HE MOST DECIDEDLY REFUSES YOU THEN ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL YOUR NAME SIR IF YOU BE SO GOOD RODOLPH M
HAVE YOU HAD THE KINDNESS TO INFORM HIM OF MY ARRIVAL
WHEN THE COUNTESS SARAH RETURNED HITHER KNOWING THE FRIENDSHIP OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FOR THE MARQUIS SHE PRESENTED HERSELF AT THE HOTEL D'HARVILLE IN THE HOPE OF MEETING MONSEIGNEUR
IT IS SO FINE AND IT IS SO NICE TO BREATHE THE OPEN AIR
HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO DISPLEASE YOU ON THE CONTRARY TIS THE EXCESS OF YOUR GOODNESS THAT MAKES ME WEEP
THAT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH IS IT NOT
WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN DEAR OLD D'HARNEIM THE NUMBERLESS RULES AND STRICT OBSERVANCES OF ETIQUETTE
DO YOU LIKE THAT
A CONSTRAINT RENDERED THE MORE INSUPPORTABLE BY HER PREGNANCY
TELL ME IN WHAT COURT IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU FIND A MORE PERFECT MODEL OF A CHAMBERLAIN
I WAS CHAFFING TO-NIGHT WITH THE GOUALEUSE WHO THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BEAT HER AND SHE RAN UP BRAS ROUGE'S ALLEY AND I AFTER HER
FINETTE WILL GO RODOLPH RESUMED HIS SEAT
HE ONCE MORE CHANGED HIS ABODE SINCE WHICH TIME ALL TRACES OF HIM HAVE BEEN LOST
AND THEN WITH AN AIR OF BRUTISH CARELESSNESS HE ADDED AT LENGTH THEY HANDCUFFED ME AND BROUGHT ME BEFORE THE BIG WIGS AND I WAS CAST FOR DEATH YOU ESCAPED HOWEVER TRUE
THE SUBDUED LIGHT OF THE HOTHOUSE FORMING A POWERFUL CONTRAST WITH THE GALLERY THE DISTANCE SEEMED FILLED WITH A SPECIES OF GOLD-COLOURED SHINING FOG IN THE MIDST OF WHICH GLITTERED AND FLICKERED LIKE A LIVING EMBROIDERY THE DAZZLING AND VARIED ROBES OF THE LADIES COMBINED WITH THE PRISMATIC SCINTILLATIONS OF THE CONGREGATED MASS OF DIAMONDS AND PRECIOUS STONES
IT'S ODD THOUGH THE EFFECT WHAT YOU SAY HAS ON ME
NOW NONE BUT THE BAKER WHO PUTS THE CONDEMNED IN HIS OVEN THE DEVIL COULD RECOGNISE HIM THE SCHOOLMASTER WHAT HAS HE DONE TO HIMSELF HE BEGAN BY DESTROYING HIS NOSE WHICH WAS AN ELL LONG
THE COMPASSION EVINCED FOR THEM IS SO RARE THAT THEY CAN ONLY EXPLAIN LIBERALITY AS A TEMPTATION TO CRIME THEN ADDRESSING THE CHOURINEUR IN A VOICE FULL OF GENTLENESS
MY DEAR MADAME THIS COLD DAY WOULD MAKE A LITTLE OF SOMETHING WARM AND COMFORTABLE VERY ACCEPTABLE
FOR IT IS SO THEN WE WILL DROP THE SUBJECT AND TO SAY SUCH THINGS OF A YOUNG MAN
BY JOVE SAID HE TO RODOLPH ALTHOUGH I HAVE SMARTED FOR IT YET I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE MET WITH YOU WHAT
EXCEPT THE CHOURINEUR AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE SCREECH-OWL ALL THE GUESTS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC HAD RETIRED ONE AFTER THE OTHER
ON QUITTING HIS YOUNG FRIEND THE POOR SQUIRE HAD COMPARED HIM AND WITH JUSTICE TO A YOUNG WILD COLT FULL OF GRACE AND FIRE CARRIED OFF FROM HIS NATIVE PRAIRIES WHERE HE HAD DWELT FREE AS AIR AND JOYOUS AS A BIRD TO BE BRIDLED AND SPURRED THAT HE MIGHT UNDER THAT SYSTEM LEARN HOW TO MODERATE AND ECONOMISE THOSE POWERS WHICH HITHERTO HE HAD ONLY EMPLOYED IN RUNNING AND LEAPING IN ANY WAY HE PLEASED
THE TWO STEMS MUTUALLY CLINGING TO EACH OTHER FOR SUPPORT AND MINGLING THEIR LEAVES AND FLOWERS IN ONE CONFUSED MASS DISPOSED THEM IN ELEGANT FESTOONS OF GREEN FRINGE SPANGLED WITH GOLD AND SILVER SPOTS AROUND THE IMMENSE VELVET FOLIAGE OF THE INDIAN FIG
DO YOU AGREE GOUALEUSE OH CERTAINLY
THE WINGED POMEGRANATE THE PASSION-FLOWER WITH ITS LARGE PURPLE FLOWERS STRIATED WITH AZURE AND CROWNED WITH ITS DARK VIOLET TUFT WAVED IN LONG SPIRAL WREATHS OVER THE HEADS OF THE ADMIRING CROWD THEN AS THOUGH FATIGUED WITH THE SPORT THREW THEIR COLOSSAL GARLANDS OF DELICATE FLOWERS ACROSS THE HARD PRICKLY LEAVES OF THE GIGANTIC ALOES
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD HAVE INDUCED THE LADY AFTER COMING TO THE VERY DOOR TO CHANGE HER MIND SO SUDDENLY THERE IS NO SAYING
AND THE UNION ALL THE FORMALITIES OF WHICH WERE CAREFULLY SCRUTINISED AND VERIFIED BY SEYTON WAS SECRETLY CELEBRATED DURING A TEMPORARY ABSENCE OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET
NAY IT SOLACED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF GOOD ACTUALLY PERFORMED AND MUCH MORE MEDITATED
BUT IT SEEMS YOU CAN'T PATTER FLASH MY FINE FELLOW I DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE WORD YOU SAY I SEE YOU CAN'T TALK SLANG LIKE M
FOR GOODNESS OF HEART AND KINDLINESS OF DISPOSITION ARE BUT RARELY SEEN AS THE PREVAILING PASSIONS REVEALED IN A FACE AS FAIR AS YOUNG HIGH-BORN AND ARDENTLY WORSHIPPED BY ALL AS WAS THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE WHO SHONE FORTH IN ALL HER LUSTRE AS THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE GALAXY OF FASHION
BUT I NEVER LEARNED HOW HE BECAME ATTACHED TO THE SERVICE OF OUR MASTER AND HOW HE HAD MARRIED CECILY WHOM I SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HIS MARRIAGE
IT WILL BE SUCH A SWEET DROP FOR ME NOT YET
I AM SURE THERE IS NOBODY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN CAN SAY I EVER GIVE THEM THE LEAST FREEDOM,--I SHOULD THINK NOT INDEED WHILE MY POOR DEAR OLD DARLING OF A HUSBAND IS LEFT NO DOUBT,--NO DOUBT MADAME PIPELET
THEY GENERALLY TREAT ME AS THEY WOULD A MANGY DOG
MIND M
THE RUFFIAN WOULD EVER AFTERWARDS BE ON HIS GUARD OR IF RECOGNISED APPREHENDED AND TAKEN BACK TO THE BAGNE WOULD CARRY WITH HIM THAT SECRET WHICH RODOLPH HAD SO MUCH INTEREST IN DISCOVERING
AND WHAT DELIGHTFUL MORNING CONCERTS WE THREE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE OWING TO HIS ALL-POWERFUL ASSISTANCE
WHAT A DIFFERENCE NOW BETWEEN YOU AND HIM ADDED THE PORTERESS ADDRESSING RODOLPH WITH AN ADMIRING GLANCE
HER CORAL LIPS WITH THEIR GENTLE SMILE GAVE TO HER EYES THE INDEFINABLE CHARM THAT HER AFFABLE AND WINNING MODE OF EXPRESSING HERSELF DERIVED FROM THEIR MILD AND ANGELIC EXPRESSION OF APPROVING GOODNESS
BRAS ROUGE AND MOTHER BURETTE
OH THAT OLD MAN IS A VERY INSINUATING HERE MADAME INTERRUPTED RODOLPH HERE ARE TWO LETTERS THE POSTMAN LEFT WHILE YOU WERE GONE DEAR ME
IT IS I I
D'HARVILLE WITH THE FACT OF HIS HAVING RELIEVED HIS KINSWOMAN FROM SUCH SEVERE DISTRESS I COMPREHEND NOW THE TWOFOLD INTEREST WHICH MY LORD HAS IN DESIRING TO DISCOVER THE TRACES OF THE SON OF THIS POOR WOMAN YOU MAY ALSO JUDGE BY THAT MY DEAR BARON OF THE AFFECTION WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS BEARS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY AND HOW DEEP IS HIS VEXATION AT SEEING THE YOUNG MARQUIS SO SAD WITH SO MANY REASONS TO BE HAPPY WHAT CAN THERE BE WANTING TO M
OF COURSE I MEAN THAT
THAT IT RESTS ONLY WITH YOURSELF TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WILL HENCEFORWARD MAKE THIS QUIET SPOT YOUR HOME AND CAST OFF THE GARMENTS YOU NOW WEAR FOR OTHERS MY KIND FRIEND MADAME GEORGES WILL FURNISH YOU WITH
FIRST OF ALL SUFFICIENT MONEY TO CLEAR MYSELF WITH THE OGRESS AND TO KEEP ME TILL I COULD OBTAIN WORK FOR MY FUTURE SUPPORT
VERY LIKELY SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOU
I TOLD MY TALE TO THE SCHOOLMASTER AND HE SNAPPED AT IT AND SAID HE WOULD BE AT THE RENDEZVOUS ACCORDINGLY
AND THEN ADDED MURPHY HAS SHOWN YOU ALL OVER THE HOUSE YES M
HE OFFERED US TWO THOUSAND FRANCS TO DO SOMETHING TO YOU
THE TALL MAN ONCE DRIVEN AWAY YOU MUST TRY AND TALK OVER THE CHOUETTE
THIS TAVERN OCCUPIES THE GROUND FLOOR OF A LOFTY HOUSE THE FRONT OF WHICH IS FORMED BY TWO WINDOWS WHICH ARE STYLED A GUILLOTINE HANGING FROM THE FRONT OF THE DOOR LEADING TO A DARK AND ARCHED PASSAGE WAS AN OBLONG LAMP ON THE CRACKED PANES OF WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN RED LETTERS NIGHTLY LODGINGS HERE THE CHOURINEUR THE UNKNOWN AND THE GOUALEUSE ENTERED INTO A LARGE BUT LOW APARTMENT WITH THE CEILING SMOKED AND CROSSED BY BLACK RAFTERS JUST VISIBLE BY THE FLICKERING LIGHT OF A MISERABLE SUSPENDED LAMP
I SUPPOSE YOU PAID FOR THEM I DID YOU ARE VERY GOOD
THE BALL
TRUE TRUE,--THAT WAS A DIFFICULT POSITION FOR HER SAID THE CHOURINEUR LAUGHING HEARTILY
BADINOT IF YOU DEEM IT NECESSARY WHY REALLY FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS A MONTH AND HIS EXPENSES AMOUNTING TO NEARLY THE SAME SUM APPEAR TO ME QUITE SUFFICIENT
HE WILL ENDURE WHAT HE CANNOT PREVENT THESE REASONS STRONG ENOUGH IN THEMSELVES DID NOT SOOTHE RODOLPH'S ANXIETIES
BUT HEAR ME
DO YOU BELIEVE IN TALISMANS
1 TAPIS-FRANC
RODOLPH ANSWERED
I DID NOT CARE FOR ANYTHING BUT THAT
THE LAW
THIS NOTE ESCAPED THE PENETRATION OF THE SCHOOLMASTER
AS I TOLD YOU M
RODOLPH YOU HAVE NO INTELLIGENCE FROM ROCHEFORT NONE SAID MADAME GEORGES SHUDDERING AND IN A LOW VOICE
BUT HE IS NOW BLIND,--HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO FIND HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND HE MAY BE CRUSHED TO DEATH IN THE STREETS
ALTHOUGH THE GRAND DUCHY OF GEROLSTEIN WAS ONLY A SECONDARY STATE POLIDORI INDULGED THE IDEA OF BEING ONE DAY ITS RICHELIEU AND OF MAKING RODOLPH PLAY THE PART OF THE DO-NOTHING PRINCE
I SHOULD SO LIKE TO RUN IN THE MEADOWS LET US RUN THEN MY CHILD
MAY I PUT UP MY HUMBLE PETITION TO BE ALLOWED TO SEE THIS NEW WONDER OF A HUNDRED AND ONE NIGHTS OH MY LORD WITH THE UTMOST PLEASURE
A SIMPLE WREATH OF THE DARK LEAVES OF THE PYRUS JAPONICUS ENCIRCLED HER HEAD AND HARMONISED ADMIRABLY WITH THE BANDEAUX OF RAVEN HAIR IT CONFINED
ONE DAY RETURNING FROM MONTFAUCON SOME LITTLE BOYS BEAT ME AND STOLE MY BASKET
TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS I HEARD FOOTSTEPS
HAVE EVERYTHING WELL DUSTED AND REMOVE THE COVERINGS FROM THE FURNITURE TAKING ESPECIAL CARE NOT TO SCRATCH THE GILDING OR TO SOIL OR BURN THE CARPET WHILE LIGHTING THE FIRES
THE BUTCHERY WAS DARK
YES PINCERS WHAT FOR TO STRIKE YOU INQUIRED RODOLPH
BUT HE LOVES YOU TOO MUCH TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SUCH AN EXTREMITY
FOR AFTER HAVING SCOURGED HIM WITH A ROD HE HAD THROWN HIM INTO PRISON
YET AT THE MARKET WHAT MADE ME ENVIOUS--OH SO ENVIOUS!--WAS TO SEE NEAT CLEAN LITTLE WORKWOMEN WHO WERE GOING AWAY SO GAILY WITH A BEAUTIFUL POT OF FLOWERS IN THEIR HANDS I AM SURE THAT IF YOU HAD HAD BUT A FEW FLOWERS IN YOUR OWN WINDOW THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT YOU COMPANY WHAT YOU SAY IS QUITE TRUE M
IT WOULD SET ANYBODY LONGING
RODOLPH ROSE AND WENT LISTLESSLY TOWARDS THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO HUM A TUNE BETWEEN HIS TEETH ACCOMPANYING HIMSELF ON THE WINDOW GLASSES
I WILL FOLLOW YOU TO THE BARRIER
HOW I DECEIVED MYSELF
YOU SEE HE STILL BEARS MALICE WITH ME I AM MORE THAN EVER AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THE SINGULAR OBSTINACY WITH WHICH HE PERSISTS IN SHUNNING YOU,--YOU FORMERLY AN OLD FRIEND
THAT IS EASILY GIVEN MADAME AND MAY BE FOUND IN THE PERFECT URBANITY AND EXQUISITE GRACE WITH WHICH YOU RECEIVE YOUR LOVELY GUESTS AND WHISPER TO EACH A FEW CHARMING AND ENCOURAGING WORDS WHICH IF THE LEAST BIT EXCEEDING STRICT TRUTH SAID RODOLPH SMILING WITH GOOD-TEMPERED SATIRE RENDERS THOSE WHO ARE EVEN PRAISED ABOVE THEIR MERITS MORE RADIANT IN BEAUTY FROM YOUR KIND COMMENDATIONS WHILE THOSE WHOSE CHARMS ADMIT OF NO EXAGGERATION ARE NO LESS RADIANT WITH THE HAPPINESS OF FINDING THEMSELVES SO JUSTLY APPRECIATED BY YOU
THE OGRESS WAS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE BULKY FAT AND HEAVY
THERE IS HIS MADAME
YOU SAY YOU DON'T KNOW HIM WHAT DO YOU MEAN WITH ALL YOUR NONSENSE ABOUT YOUR BRAS ROUGE
ONE FELLOW SHOWS FIGHT STILL THE ASSASSIN IN THE GREEK CAP WAS FURIOUS WITH RAGE AND WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET HIM INTO A HACKNEY-COACH WHICH WAS WAITING IN THE STREET HE RESISTED SO STOUTLY THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY HIM
BADINOT IS THE VERY ORIGINAL TYPE OF ONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS EXISTENCES WHICH ARE TO BE MET WITH AND ONLY POSSIBLE IN PARIS
I BELONG TO HER AND I MUST PAY HER WHEN SHE HAD UTTERED THESE LAST WORDS THE UNHAPPY GIRL COULD NOT HELP SHUDDERING AND A TEAR TREMBLED IN HER LONG EYELASHES
FOR IN THE DAYTIME THE CHOUETTE KEPT HER STALL FOR SELLING FISHING-LINES NEAR THE BRIDGE OF NOTRE DAME
AND THAT HE MIGHT COMPLETELY ATTACH THE TWO TO HIM HE PRESSED ON SIR THOMAS SEYTON THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE VACANT POST OF HIS FIRST GROOM OF THE CHAMBER AND ENTREATED SARAH NOT TO QUIT THE GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH AS SHE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT HER
13 SIR PERHAPS WE MAY LEARN SOMETHING THERE SAID SEYTON IN A LOW VOICE TO HIS SISTER
LET THAT EXPLAIN MY DEEP SYMPATHY WITH ALL WHO SUFFER AND FOR YOURSELF PARTICULARLY FLEUR-DE-MARIE OR RATHER MARIE ONLY
THOUGH IT'S TRUE THEY PLAYED ME A SCURVY TRICK IN BRINGING ME INTO THE WORLD
THE CLOTHES I WEAR BELONG TO THE OGRESS AND I AM IN DEBT TO HER FOR MY BOARD AND LODGING
YOU CAN NEITHER SAY NOR DO THE THING THAT IS RIGHT AND WITH THIS HE PULLED OFF HIS DRESSING-GOWN AND THREW HIS BEAUTIFUL GREEK CAP MADE OF VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD ON THE GROUND
WHY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN TO CUT UP OLD HORSES
FOR THE CHOUETTE KICKED ME UNTIL I AWOKE
YOU SEEM AS THOUGH YOUR THOUGHTS WERE FAR FROM THE PRESENT SCENE NOTHING NOTHING I ASSURE YOU REPLIED THE MARQUISE FAINTLY
ON ENTERING INTO THE HOUSE YOU GOT INSIDE THE HOUSE THEN
LE SIT DOWN I TELL YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE MADAME DE LUCENAY IS IMMENSELY RICH WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA STILL I ONLY REPEAT WHAT OTHERS SAY
DEAR ME
DEAR ME
IN AN INSTANT HIS STEP FALTERED
COCOTTE AND LOOKED ABOUT ME IN EVERY DIRECTION TO SCRUTINISE EVERY THING
MADAME PIPELET HAVING COMPLETED HER CULINARY ARRANGEMENTS RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH RODOLPH
AND WHAT IS THE ADDRESS OF BRAS ROUGE IN THAT STREET ASKED SEYTON OF THE CHOURINEUR
TO REINSTATE SUCH PERFECTLY IN THEIR OWN ESTIMATION,---TO LEAD BACK TO HONESTY THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED IN PURITY SOME GENEROUS AND ENNOBLING SENTIMENTS IN THE MIDST OF THE CONTEMPT THAT WITHERS THEM THE MISERY THAT EATS INTO THEM THE CORRUPTION THAT ENCIRCLES THEM AND FOR THAT END TO BRAVE IN PERSON THIS MISERY THIS CORRUPTION THIS CONTAGION IS BETTER STILL
AND SO FAR AS CONCERNS MONEY MATTERS HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S FEARS ARE WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
WHAT A CLEVER MANAGER I HAVE HAVEN'T I SAID THE RUFFIAN
WHEN I HAD CUT THE ANIMALS THROATS THEY GAVE ME FOR MY TROUBLE A PIECE OF THE THIGH OF SOME ANIMAL THAT HAD DIED OF DISEASE
THAT'S HIS LINE AIN'T IT MOTHER PONISSE OH
PIPELET,--NOTHING MORE IF YOU PLEASE JUST AS YOU PLEASE SIR
YET I HAVE OFTEN SUGGESTED THIS IDEA TO YOU
THIS MORNING ACCORDING TO YOUR ORDERS I RAN HERE TO BRING YOU THE ANSWER
THAT WOULD ENRAGE HER,--MAKE HER IN A PASSION
NEXT DAY HE CAME AGAIN ACCOMPANIED BY A YOUNG MAN OF FAIR COMPLEXION SMALL MOUSTACHES AND WEARING A CROSS OF HONOUR AND VERY FINE LINEN
AT THE RISK OF REPEATING A VULGAR SAYING WE WILL ASSERT THAT THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY DRESS IS SO POWERFUL THAT THE GUEST OF THE CRIBS OF THE CITE WAS HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED IN HIS PRESENT ATTIRE
THAT'S A GOOD ACTION M
DON'T YOU THINK SO DROLL GROANED POOR PIPELET
BUT I HAVE A SCORE TO WIPE OFF WITH HIM AND THE CHOUETTE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A PLOT WITH OTHERS AGAINST ME
WHILST HE WAS CONNING ALL THIS OVER IN HIS MIND THE CHOURINEUR HAD MECHANICALLY FOLLOWED TOM AND SARAH AND SAW THEM GET INTO A COACH WHICH AWAITED THEM NEAR NOTRE DAME
FAITH MY FINE FELLOW THE WAY WAS LONG AND THE COLD EXCESSIVE
IN HALF AN HOUR I WILL BE HERE AGAIN AND YOU SHALL SEE WHAT I WILL DO SAID THE CHOUETTE
WE HAVE NO MORE CUTLETS OR LEGS OF MUTTON LEFT AND WE MUST KILL A SHEEP OR TWO DIRECTLY PARBLEU SAID RODOLPH TO THE CHOURINEUR
I COULD NOT EVEN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE TIP OF HER NOSE
YOU CAN TELL US WHETHER THIS IS THE DOOR OF THE MONEY-CHEST SAID THE CHOUETTE
WHY WHY SHOULD I BE PUNISHED AT ONCE
THE PORTER'S RECOGNITION OF RODOLPH AS HE ENTERED WAS GRACIOUS IN THE EXTREME
IN SPITE OF HIS NATURAL AUDACITY THE CHOURINEUR SHOWED A DEFERENCE FOR RODOLPH AND ABSTAINED FROM FAMILIARITY
BUT TO INFORM THE GRAND DUKE WOULD BE TO ALIENATE FROM HIM FOR EVER THE HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE THRONE
AT THE END OF A MONTH IF YOU MANAGE PRUDENTLY YOU WILL HAVE SAVED SIXTY FRANCS
THE MAN WHO OCCUPIES THIS DWELLING IN THE ABSENCE OF THE PROPRIETOR WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO YOU
AFTER DINNER YOU READ OR WORK WHILE YOUR AUNT AND HER GUEST HAVE A FRIENDLY GAME AT PIQUET
YOUR BLOWS FELL AS IF FROM A SLEDGE-HAMMER
HE BECAME THE ASSOCIATE OF THIEVES MURDERERS PICKPOCKETS AND FORGERS AND ERE LONG FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE LAW WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLEYS FOR THE TERM OF HIS NATURAL LIFE
THEY SHOWED ME THE DOOR WITHOUT MAKING ME ANY ANSWER
THANKS TO THE MANNERS AND THE LANGUAGE WHICH HE ASSUMED WITH SO MUCH EASE RODOLPH WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GUESTS OF THE OGRESS
DO YOU KNOW THEM CRIED FLEUR-DE-MARIE
SON
HE WHO WORE THE GREEK CAP SAID TO HIS COMRADE THE GROS-BOITEUX DOES NOT SHOW NOR THE SCHOOLMASTER PERHAPS THE SKELETON HAS DONE FOR HIM AND MADE OFF WITH THE SWAG A PRECIOUS GO THAT WOULD BE FOR US WHO LAID THE PLANT AND LOOK OUT FOR OUR SNACKS REPLIED THE OTHER
AND IF I DO WRONG MAY THE ALMIGHTY PUNISH ME ALONE THE NEGRO RANG
I REPEAT THAT IF YOU PLEASE YOU MAY FROM THIS VERY HOUR LEAD HERE WITH MADAME GEORGES THAT PEACEFUL LIFE WHOSE DESCRIPTION BUT A SHORT TIME SINCE SO MUCH DELIGHTED YOU
PERHAPS THEY HAD NOT ENOUGH TO FEED THEMSELVES SAID GOUALEUSE WITH BITTERNESS
SHE HAD APPARENTLY BEEN CRYING FOR SHE KEPT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER FACE
RIGOLETTE AND THE WEAKNESS OF M
BY THE WAY MY TRUMP SAID HE TO THE UNKNOWN WHAT SAY YOU INSTEAD OF GOING TO TIPPLE SHALL WE GO AND HAVE A CRUST FOR SUPPER WITH THE OGRESS AT THE WHITE RABBIT
I HAVE MADE A VOW NEVER TO SPEAK TO HER
RODOLPH SO THAT IT BE THE COUNTRY
ARRIVED AT THE TOP HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A THICK DOOR
RODOLPH'S PASSION HAD REACHED A HEIGHT ALMOST OF FRENZY
WE NOW CONDUCT THE READER INTO THE LITTLE TOWN OF THE ISLE-ADAM SITUATED IN A DELIGHTFUL LOCALITY ON THE BANKS OF THE OISE AND AT THE FOOT OF A FOREST
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY TIMBER-YARD SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN A CROSS TONE
SEE TOO MY SADNESS IS GOING AWAY AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME
BUT IT IS HORRIBLE WEATHER
I AM YOUR WIFE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND MEN
I RUSHED OUT AND BEFORE THE COACHMAN HAD TIME TO GET ON HIS SEAT AGAIN I CALLED OUT HALLO THERE COACHY
WE SHALL HAVE OUR BREAKFAST SOON AND SHALL NOT BE DISTURBED IN OUR CONVERSATION A WAITER BROUGHT IN THE BREAKFAST AND BEFORE HE SHUT THE DOOR RODOLPH SAW THE CHARCOAL-MAN MURPHY SEATED WITH GREAT COMPOSURE AT A TABLE IN A ROOM CLOSE AT HAND
WHY HAVE YOU NO FEELING
TWO MEN ENTERED
THE WEATHER HAS CLEARED UP AND WE WILL GO AND WALK ABOUT AND GIVE A LOOK AT THE ALLEE DES VEUVES
BUT HE DOES THE LAW BUSINESS FOR THE FIRM I BELONG TO AH
WE MUST RESIGN OURSELVES TO OUR FATE,--MISERABLE IS IT NOT
AND BEHOLD
NOT I GOUALEUSE
THEY HAVE HAD NOTHING FOR ALL THAT PERIOD BESIDES LOUISE'S WAGES AND WHAT THEY COULD OBTAIN FROM MOTHER BURETTE UPON THE FEW WRETCHED ARTICLES THEY COULD DISPOSE OF
MUCH DID MADAME PIPELET PRIDE HERSELF UPON THIS TASTEFUL COVERING TO HER SEXAGENARIAN SKULL
NEXT NIGHT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WAS IN BED WHEN RAP RAP RAP COMES TO THE GATE
TO SEEK AFTER THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING AGAINST MISFORTUNE WITH ENERGY AND HONOUR AND TO AID THEM SOMETIMES WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE,--TO PREVENT IN RIGHT TIME MISERY AND TEMPTATION IS BETTER
THE STRONGEST HAVE TREMBLED BEFORE YOU,--I WILL MAKE YOU HENCEFORWARD SHRINK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE WEAKEST OF BEINGS
YOU SAID TO ME MY LAD RETURN TO-MORROW BEFORE DAYBREAK
IF I CATCH HIM I'LL SKIN HIM ALIVE FOURLINE TAKE CARE REPLIED THE CHOUETTE
ONE WORD MORE
HE WOULD ALMOST AS SOON LOSE THE SIGHT OF AN EYE AS PAY HIS WORKMEN
IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD THE SCRUPULOUS DELICACY AND LIGHTNESS OF TOUCH WITH WHICH SPREADING OUT HIS TWO FIRST FINGERS HE SEIZED THE FRAGILE CRYSTAL
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
AND HOW THE RIVER ROARS
HE ASKED YOU WHAT YOU WANTED
AND SHE ONLY WENT OUT AT NIGHT TO BUY SOME BREAD AND IT WAS THEN SHE MET WITH THE POOR LORRAINE ILL AND HARDLY ABLE TO DRAG HERSELF ALONG FOR SHE WAS EXPECTING TO BE BROUGHT TO BED EVERY HOUR
AND BESIDES I MAKE HIM CAREFUL OF OUR INTERESTS EVEN UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF THE PARTICULARS HE HAS HITHERTO FURNISHED US WITH HAVE BEEN VERY CORRECT AND SATISFACTORY OH HE HAS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER OF GOING TO WORK
INDEED--TRULY--I DON'T LIKE IT
RODOLPH ADDRESSED THE SCHOOLMASTER
AT THIS MOMENT I DO NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT I DID NOT DIE ON THE SPOT WITH FRIGHT
AND THIS EXPLAINS HOW SO IMPORTANT A DOCUMENT FOUND ITS WAY TO THAT MONSTER'S POSSESSION AND ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR THE EXPRESSION USED BY THE CHOUETTE AT HER RENCONTRE WITH THE GOUALEUSE IN THE CABARET OF THE WHITE RABBIT WHEN BY WAY OF TORMENTING HER VICTIM SHE SAID WE HAVE FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT YOUR PARENTS BUT YOU SHALL NEVER KNOW WHO OR WHAT THEY ARE THE POINT TO BE DECIDED WAS AS TO THE VERACITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DETAILED BY TOURNEMINE IN HIS LETTER TO THE CHOUETTE
CHARLES ROBERT REQUIRED NOT THE AID OF RANK OR TITLES TO RENDER HIM WORTHY OF UNIVERSAL ADMIRATION
WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THE IMPUDENCE OF THAT LITTLE BEGGAR TO SEAT HIMSELF BEHIND THE COACH
IF THE SKELETON HAD HAD A WOMAN LIKE ME AT HIS ELBOW HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NABBED WITH HIS GULLY IN THE DEAD MAN'S WEASAND HE'S DONE UP AND NOW HE WILL NOT LEAVE THE STONE JUG EXCEPT TO KISS THE HEADSMAN'S DAUGHTER AND BE A HEAD SHORTER WHAT STRANGE LANGUAGE THESE PEOPLE TALK SAID SARAH WHO HAD INVOLUNTARILY HEARD THE LAST FEW WORDS OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE
I ALREADY OWE HER FOR THE CLOTHES I'M WEARING WHAT YOU WANT TO SHIRK IT SHOUTED THE CHOURINEUR DARTING AFTER LA GOUALEUSE WHO HAD HID HERSELF IN A GULLY AS MURK AS MIDNIGHT
TONNERRE WITH A TOOL LIKE THIS I COULD FACE A WILD BULL AND THE CHOURINEUR BRANDISHED HIS KNIFE,--HIS EYES BEGAN TO FILL WITH BLOOD
I SAID THEM IN SPITE OF MYSELF AND WITH SORROW
NOT FINDING COCOTTE I HAD MADE SO MUCH LAMENTATION THAT I PRETENDED I WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH
AND IT REALLY SEEMS AS IF YOU DAILY FOUND GREATER PLEASURE IN TORMENTING HIM AND PLAYING WITH HIS FEELINGS IS IT POSSIBLE YOU CAN REALLY THINK SO INDEED IN SPITE OF MYSELF I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM ENTERTAINING THAT OPINION
DID I NOT TELL YOU SO
THE CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ARE GREEN LIKE THE BLINDS
THE CARPET-MAKER ONLY CALLED HIM COMMANDANT TO FLATTER HIM
IT IS PERHAPS TO KILL
UNLESS YOU REPENT AND THAT WITH ALL YOUR HEART FOR THE MISDEEDS OF YOUR INFAMOUS LIFE I WOULD IN THIS WORLD AT LEAST SHUT OUT FROM YOU THE FAINTEST GLIMMER OF HOPE WHAT MAN IS THIS
NO WOMAN BUT SHE WOULD HAVE DREAMT OF SUCH A THING SHE PERHAPS HOPED BY SUCH A STEP TO TOUCH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS AND COMPEL HIM TO AN INTERVIEW WHICH HE HAS ALWAYS REFUSED AND AVOIDED
I THINK MADAME PIPELET YOU WERE SAYING THAT THE PRINCIPAL LESSEE OF THE HOUSE IS M
INDEED REPLIED MURPHY
DO YOU THINK I WATCH MY CUSTOMERS SAID THE OGRESS IN A BRUTAL TONE
THE NEAREST-SIGHTED PERSONS SAW WHAT SARAH WOULD NO LONGER CONCEAL FOR HER PREGNANCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIDDEN LONGER HAD SHE BUT HAVE CHOSEN
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS INDEED KIND THUS TO HONOUR OUR POOR ENTERTAINMENT NAY MADAME REPLIED RODOLPH GRACEFULLY BOWING ON THE HAND EXTENDED TO HIM YOUR LADYSHIP IS WELL AWARE OF THE SINCERE PLEASURE IT AFFORDS TO PAY MY COMPLIMENTS TO YOURSELF
THE ABBE LIKED BETTER AS THEY SAID TO CLOTHE ONE OR TWO POOR CHILDREN IN GOOD WARM BROADCLOTH THAN FAIRE LE MUGUET
WHILE HER HEAD-DRESS WAS COMPOSED OF A BRUTUS WIG ORIGINALLY OF A BLOND COLOUR BUT CHANGED BY TIME INTO EVERY SHADE OF RED BROWN AND YELLOW THE STIFF ENDS OF THE PERISHED HAIR STANDING OUT LIKE THE EARS OF WHEAT IN A WHEAT-SHEAF
THE CHOUETTE TIED MY LITTLE BASKET OF BARLEY-SUGAR ROUND MY NECK AND STATIONED ME ON THE PONT NEUF WHERE IN WINTER I WAS FROZEN TO DEATH
BRAS ROUGE IS GOING TO TURN INTO THE STREETS IN TWO OR THREE DAYS TIME IF EVEN HE WAIT SO LONG,--WHY MLLE
HER THINGS BELONG TO ME NOT INCLUDING AS SHE OWES ME A MATTER OF NINETY FRANCS AS A BALANCE FOR HER BOARD AND LODGING FOR THE SIX WEEKS AS SHE HAS LODGED WITH ME
GREEK CAP ASKED TWICE FOR HIM AND SAID THEY HAD BUSINESS TOGETHER
AND THE MEDICAL MEN OF THE DISTRICT IGNORANT AS THEY WERE GAVE THEMSELVES NO GREAT DEAL OF CARE OR TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LONG DISTANCE AND THE DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ANY MEANS OF CONVEYANCE
AH SAID HE TURNING TO RODOLPH NEVER ALLOW A PAINTER TO ENTER YOUR DOORS
MY MODESTY WOULD NOT LET ME ADDED M
I HAVE A CONFUSED RECOLLECTION OF HAVING HEARD THE CHOURINEUR'S VOICE THERE
YOU AND M
AND A FINE HOUSE AND FINE SHOP IT IS,--ALL SO NEAT AND SO COMFORTABLE
WHAT AN ACCUMULATION OF EVIL HAS BEEN WROUGHT DURING THAT PERIOD BY THE CRIMINAL COMPLIANCE OF THAT RASCALLY POLIDORI BY THE WAY TALKING OF THAT MISERABLE WRETCH I HAVE TRACED THAT HE WAS HERE ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO AGO SUFFERING NO DOUBT FROM THE MOST PERFECT DESTITUTION OR ELSE SUBSISTING BY DISGRACEFUL AND DISHONOURABLE PRACTICES WHAT A PITY THAT A MAN SO LARGELY ENDOWED WITH PENETRATION TALENT DEEP LEARNING AND NATURAL INTELLIGENCE SHOULD SINK SO LOW THE INNATE PERVERSITY OF HIS CHARACTER MARRED ALL THESE HIGH QUALITIES
THEY GAVE ME BRANDY TO DRINK AND--AND--HERE I AM SAID THE UNHAPPY CREATURE HIDING HER FACE IN HER HANDS
WHO TOUCHES ME ASKED HE IN A HUSKY VOICE
YES JUST THAT SORT OF DISLIKE ANY WOMAN WOULD ENTERTAIN FOR A PEEVISH JEALOUS ILL-TEMPERED AT THIS EXPLANATION OF THE COUNTESS'S MEANING AS REGARDED MADAME D'HARVILLE'S IMAGINED DISLIKE FOR HER HUSBAND A HEAVY LOAD SEEMED TAKEN FROM HER
BUT VERY OFTEN AS IT WAS SO FAR TO THE LIME-KILNS AT CLICHY AND I WAS TIRED AFTER MY WORK I SLEPT UNDER THE LARGE STONES AT THE LOUVRE
SHE MUST BE MAD AS WELL AS FOOLISH TO PERSIST IN SO HOPELESS A PURSUIT IF SHE BE MAD THERE IS A DANGEROUS METHOD IN HER MADNESS HER BROTHER YOU ARE AWARE PARTAKES OF HER AMBITIOUS SCHEMES AND OBSTINATE OPINIONS OF ULTIMATE SUCCESS
GIVE ME THE RIPPING CHISEL AND THE JEMMY WHAT INSTRUMENTS ARE THEY ASKED RODOLPH
THERE ARE SUNDAYS AND FETE-DAYS TO BE THOUGHT OF YES
THE FACT OF HIS HAVING FOUND HIS MASTER AS HE CALLED HIM HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN IN THE GENEROUS CONDUCT OF RODOLPH
THERE IS EVERY HOPE OF HIS RECOVERY RECOVERY
ARE YOU AS HARD AS YOUR OWN FISTS GO ON MY GIRL SAID RODOLPH TO FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITHOUT APPEARING TO NOTICE THE CHOURINEUR'S APPEAL
AND SO YOU HAVE REALLY SWORN TO DRIVE HIM TO DESPAIR FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN EXCLAIMED MADAME D'HARVILLE THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING I TELL YOU I KNOW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO MY POOR CHILD
SOME QUESTIONS OF SEYTON'S AS TO THE DISPOSITION AND EARLY LIFE OF RODOLPH QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE PASSED WITHOUT NOTICE WITH A PERSON LESS AWAKE TO ALL THAT OCCURRED THAN THE DOCTOR IN A MOMENT ENLIGHTENED HIM AS TO THE ULTERIOR AIMS OF THE BROTHER AND SISTER
HE WILL HEAR ME RING THE BELL SEE ME AND GIVE THE WORD TO THE CHOUETTE
BUT IF SHE DOES NOT COME FOR HERSELF SHE DOES FOR OTHERS
AS FOR ALFRED AND ME WE WERE BETTER PLEASED THAN IF WE HAD FOUND TEN FRANCS WHY SO BY ENJOYING THE RAGE AND CONFUSION OF THE COMMANDANT WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF A THIRD TIME DISAPPOINTED
WELL MURPHY MURPHY DON'T YOU HEAR ME THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN TURNED HIS BACK AND PRETENDED TO BLOW HIS NOSE WITH A VERY LOUD NOISE THEN PUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POCKET PULLED HIS HAT OVER HIS EYES AND TURNING HALF AROUND OFFERED HIS ARM TO MARIE MANAGING SO SKILFULLY THAT NEITHER RODOLPH NOR MADAME GEORGES COULD SEE HIS FACE
BUT A VERY SHORT TIME SUFFICED TO STRIP THE MASK FROM HIS VICIOUS CHARACTER AND TO DISPLAY HIS NATURAL PROPENSITIES
TAKE MY MISERABLE LIFE
FINETTE CRIES THE SCHOOLMASTER I HAVE LET FALL THE KNIFE
MURPHY YOU TOLD ME I AM GLAD I HAVE FOUND YOU AND STILL HAPPY PERHAPS OH YES M
MADAME GEORGES MARIE RODOLPH AND THE CURE REMAINED TOGETHER
TONNERRE YOU SHALL SEE HOW I HANDLE A KNIFE
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS SEATED BY THE STOVE IN THE CENTRE OF THE LODGE DEEPLY ENGROSSED IN WATCHING THE BOILING OF A POT PLACED OVER IT
TONNERRE AND I WITH MY KNEES AT LIBERTY
MY LORD SAID MURPHY IN DEEP DISTRESS MY GOOD LORD FORGIVE ME
THAT SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR ONLY GIVING TWELVE FRANCS A MONTH FOR MINDING YOUR APARTMENTS AND THE THIRD TIME AH THE THIRD TIME I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL RIGHT
AND DO YOU AT THE SAME TIME TELL THEM TO BRING HIM IN HERE CHAPTER XVII
YET THOUGH IT IS NOW AUTUMN I ENJOY IT QUITE AS MUCH
IF I DO NOT PULL OUT YOUR TEETH I WILL HAVE OUT OF YOUR EYES EVERY TEAR IN YOUR BODY
SHE OUGHT TO BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HAVING TAKEN UP WITH SUCH A FACE AT THE NAME OF THE SCHOOLMASTER A SORT OF SHUDDER SEEMED TO CIRCULATE AMONGST THE GUESTS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC
A RETURNED CONVICT WHO IN THIS FOUL PHRASEOLOGY IS CALLED AN OGRE OR A WOMAN IN THE SAME DEGRADED STATE WHO IS TERMED AN OGRESS GENERALLY KEEP SUCH CRIBS FREQUENTED BY THE REFUSE OF THE PARISIAN POPULATION
I KNOW ALL AND HE TOOK THE HAND OF MARIE IN HIS OWN WITHERED AND TREMBLING PALMS
GOD REPLIED THE PLANTER BURSTING INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER TELL HIM THEN,--TELL GOD TO COME AND SNATCH YOU FROM MY POWER
FROM A MAN FORMED AFTER THE IMAGE OF HIS CREATOR YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF A BEAST OF PREY
AND THERE HAPPENS FORTUNATELY TO BE A NICE LITTLE BRIDGE BY WHICH THE RIVER SEPARATING THE FARM-LAND FROM THE MEADOW MAY BE CROSSED
AND AS FOR THE DRESSING-GOWN OH MY
MURPHY AND RODOLPH 119 XII
THE RAPIDLY RISING FLOOD HAD NOW REACHED HIS VERY THROAT AND ERE LONG WOULD HAVE ASCENDED TO HIS LIPS
SHE HAD NOT YET RECOGNISED IN GOUALEUSE PEGRIOTTE HER OLD VICTIM
NEITHER WOULD YOU BELIEVE YOU WERE TRULY DOOMED TO DIE TILL IN THE VERY GRASP OF THE EXECUTIONER
HER LONG TRESSES OF BRIGHT CHESTNUT HAIR FLOATED OVER HER BEAUTIFULLY FORMED SHOULDERS WHITE AND POLISHED AS MARBLE
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT I FELT
WHERE DO YOU COME FROM CRIES OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER QUITE OFF HIS GUARD AT THAT
OPEN IT AND TAKE OUT FIVE NOTES OF A THOUSAND FRANCS EACH AND BRING THEM TO ME AND INQUIRED THE CHOURINEUR INVOLUNTARILY WHO ARE THOSE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS FOR FOR THE SCHOOLMASTER
ONE WORD THOUGH IF YOU PLEASE M
WHO WOULD THINK NOW M
OH SPARE IT PEACE COWARD
HIS EYES EXPANDED HIS HAIR STIFFENED
BEFORE CERTAIN AUDIENCES WHICH ARE OF NECESSITY HE SHUTS HIMSELF UP WITH THE COLONEL FOR A HALF-HOUR OR SO AND THEN LEAVES HIM FULL OF SPIRITS AND LIGHT AS AIR QUITE READY TO MEET BORES AND DEFY THEM JUST AS THE ROMAN SOLDIER WHO BEFORE A FORCED MARCH USED TO SOLE HIS SANDALS WITH LEAD AND SO FOUND ALL FATIGUE LIGHT BY LEAVING THEM OFF
I HEARD THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO WAS TALKING IN A FRIENDLY TONE WITH SOMEBODY
17 RUE DU TEMPLE,--A YOUNG AND PRETTY GRISETTE NAMED RIGOLETTE BETWEEN WHOM AND GERMAIN A VERY CLOSE ACQUAINTANCE APPEARS TO HAVE EXISTED
I AM VERY DESIROUS OF TAKING THE VACANT CHAMBER,--BOTH THE STREET AND NEIGHBOURHOOD SUIT ME
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT
NOTHING APPEARS TO PRESERVE THE BODY MORE EFFECTUALLY FROM ALL THE ATTACKS OF SICKNESS OR DECAY THAN A COLD-HEARTED EGOTISTICAL DISREGARD OF EVERY ONE BUT OURSELVES
YOU MAY KNOW HIM BY HIS STEEPLE-CROWNED HAT AND THERE SURE ENOUGH ON THE DOOR OF THE ROOM RODOLPH WAS ABOUT TO HIRE MIGHT BE SEEN A PALETTE SURROUNDED BY ALL KINDS OF ODD AND WHIMSICAL CREATURES THE WITTY CONCEIT OF WHICH MIGHT HAVE DONE HONOUR TO CALLOT
FURTHER ON THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN HARDLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE WITH BEARDLESS CHIN AND A COUNTENANCE WAN WRINKLED AND HEAVY HIS EYE DULL AND HIS LONG BLACK HAIR STRAGGLING DOWN HIS NECK
AND THEN TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY,--I WHO NEVER EARNED BUT TWO,--AND THAT ALL AT ONCE
IF ALL YOUR FELLOW WORKMEN ARE LIKE YOU THERE MUST BE A TIDY LOT OF YOU
THE SIGHT OF A FRIEND CANNOT BE HURTFUL
A THICK AND MOIST FOG WAS ADDED TO THE RAIN AS NIGHT APPROACHED
ISN'T IT
SEYTON GAVE THE PRINCE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE
DAVID DID NOT UTTER A WORD WHEN HE SAW US
AND IT MUST BE TRUE FOR I HAVE NEVER SINCE MET ONE OF THESE OLD CUPIDS WITH A WICKER-WORK QUIVER WITHOUT A LONGING TO PITCH INTO HIM,--A PROOF THAT ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE THUMPED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD
THE FOUR STORIES 292 XXV
WHY IT WAS A SERIOUS MATTER TO ME,--BUT THAT WAS AFTERWARDS
IF HE EVER ENJOYS HIMSELF IT IS ONLY ALONG WITH THE PRIESTS DRINKING HOLY WATER AND EATING BLESSED BREAD
NOW MY DEAR CLEMENCE YOU MUST CONFESS TO BEING A MOST CAPRICIOUS LITTLE LADY
ARE YOU GOING BACK AGAIN YES SAYS HE
AFTER THE CONDEMNATION OF HER HUSBAND MADAME GEORGES WITHOUT GIVING ANY REASON FOR SO DOING QUITTED THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE AND WENT TO HIDE HER SHAME AND HER SORROWS IN PARIS WHERE SHE SOON FELL INTO THE UTMOST DISTRESS
IF I SHOULD NOT BE IN ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK WHEN A LADY WILL ARRIVE IN A HACKNEY-COACH AND INQUIRE FOR ME BY THE NAME OF M
I WAS QUITE BEWILDERED AND SAW NOTHING CLEAR BEFORE ME
WE HAVE SAID ALREADY THAT THE CHOURINEUR WAS CLOTHED IN TROUSERS AND FROCK OF BLUE COTTON AND ON HIS HEAD HE HAD ONE OF THOSE LARGE STRAW HATS USUALLY WORN BY WORKMEN IN TIMBER-YARDS AND BARGE-EMPTIERS
JUST FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE ONE OF THEM GRAND CAFES ON THE BOULEVARDS
SHE LENT A FEW SOUS UPON THEIR WRETCHED CLOTHES
IN AN INSTANT THIS MUTE LANGUAGE CEASED
THE DOCTOR RESOLVED FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN TO UNDERTAKE THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL
BESIDES TO SUCCOUR THE UNFORTUNATE IS TO HONOUR GOD IT IS MY FRIEND WHEN THE OBJECTS DESERVE IT
SHE WAS THE MOST UGLY FORBIDDING WRINKLED TOOTHLESS OLD HAG ONE MIGHT MEET IN THE COURSE OF A LONG LIFE
WE WILL JOIN YOU PRESENTLY
SO NOW MY DEAR MURPHY FAREWELL TILL THE EVENING TILL THE EVENING ADIEU HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GRAND BALL AT THE
HER SMALL AND ROSY MOUTH WHICH HARDLY EVER SMILED HER NOSE STRAIGHT AND DELICATELY CHISELLED HER ROUNDED CHIN HAD IN THEIR COMBINED EXPRESSION A NOBILITY AND A SWEETNESS SUCH AS WE CAN ONLY FIND IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF RAPHAEL'S PORTRAITS
AND FROM YOUR CONFESSION I MAY PERHAPS FIND THE MEANS OF RESTORING TO HER FAMILY A POOR CREATURE MUCH MORE UNFORTUNATE THAN GUILTY
HONOUR HE REPEATED WITH AN AIR WHICH WAS ACTUALLY PENSIVE
MORBLEU WHAT A PRETTY CHAIN YOU HAVE SAID RODOLPH TO THE ONE-EYED WOMAN
AND THEN WHAT A BLOW FOR THE VANITY OR THE HEART OF THE YOUNG PRINCE TO LET HIM KNOW THAT IT WAS FOR HIS ROYAL RANK ALONE THAT THE LADY WAS DESIROUS TO WED HIM
WHETHER RODOLPH NO LONGER FEARED MEETING WITH THE TWO PERSONS WHOM HE HAD EVADED THE OVER-NIGHT OR DID NOT CARE WHETHER HE FACED THEM OR NOT ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING HE ENTERED THE RUE AUX FEVES AND DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE TAVERN OF THE OGRESS
WILL IT SUIT YOU INQUIRED MADAME PIPELET
THUS THE DOOR CONDUCTING TO THOSE OF THE COMMANDANT BORE EVIDENCES OF HAVING BEEN RECENTLY PAINTED IN CLOSE IMITATION OF EBONY BEING FURTHER SET OFF WITH A BRASS KNOB RUBBED UP TO A MOST DAZZLING BRIGHTNESS WHILE A GAY-COLOURED BELL-ROPE FINISHED BY AN ENORMOUS TASSEL OF SCARLET SILK CONTRASTED STRONGLY WITH THE MEAN AND SHABBY WALL AGAINST WHICH IT HUNG
BUT OFTEN HAVE I FELT MY EYES GROW MOIST AS HER MANY TRIALS AND MISFORTUNES RISE TO MY RECOLLECTION
MONSEIGNEUR DECLARES THAT THE SHOULDERS OF A CHAMBERLAIN HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY
SARAH MIGHT BECOME OR BE MADE THE DELICIOUS REALITY WHICH SHOULD SUBSTANTIATE SO MANY GLORIOUS DREAMS
YOU HAVE REGULAR ALTERNATING PAROXYSMS OF ADMIRATION AND VIOLENT DISLIKE FOR THE PRINCE
YOU CARRIED OFF YOUR CHILD FROM HIS MOTHER FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND YOU ALONE POSSESS THE SECRET OF HIS EXISTENCE
OR SAD IF SADNESS MOST SUITS YOUR PRESENT STATE OF MIND
BUT LOOK HERE IT IS AND GOUALEUSE TOOK FROM HER POCKET A LITTLE BUNDLE OF WOOD TRIMMED VERY CAREFULLY AND TIED WITH A ROSE-COLOURED BOW
HE WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO COMMAND HIS COUNTENANCE AND CONCEAL THE WORKINGS OF HIS THOUGHTS
ALTHOUGH HIS MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD APPEARED VERY SLENDER YET HE HAD RENDERED THE MOST GENEROUS ASSISTANCE TO AN INDIGENT FAMILY OCCUPYING THE GARRETS OF THE HOUSE
HE SEEMED AS THOUGH HE CONFERRED A FAVOUR ON THE EARTH BY DEIGNING TO WALK ON IT AND WENT STICKING HIS NOSE INTO THE AIR AS IF HE MEANT TO TOUCH THE CLOUDS WITH IT
FOR I FEEL VERY TIRED AND THE COLD HAS QUITE SEIZED ME
YOU WILL FIND YOURS SOME DAY SOONER OR LATER,--EVERYBODY DOES
ON EACH SIDE OF HER FAIR TEMPLES WAS A BAND OF HAIR OF THE MOST SPLENDID AUBURN HUE WHICH DESCENDED IN LUXURIANT RINGLETS HALF WAY DOWN HER CHEEKS AND WAS THEN TURNED BACK BEHIND THE EAR A PORTION OF WHICH--IVORY SHADED WITH CARNATION--WAS THUS VISIBLE AND WAS THEN LOST UNDER THE CLOSE FOLDS OF A LARGE COTTON HANDKERCHIEF WITH BLUE CHECKS TIED AS IT IS CALLED EN MARMOTTE
WHAT AN EFFECT IT MUST HAVE HAD ON YOU YES OH YES WAS HER REPLY
THE VAULT
NOW IMAGINE YOURSELF LODGING IN THE VERY NEXT ROOM TO A NICE PRETTY OBLIGING YOUNG PERSON LIKE MLLE
DE GRAUEN WORE A BLACK COAT,--THAT WAS ETIQUETTE,--AND A RIBAND SHOT WITH SEVERAL BRIGHT COLOURS WAS SUSPENDED FROM HIS BUTTONHOLE
THEY ONLY JUST SIPPED A DRAIN OR SO AND BUT WHAT DID THEY SAY TO THE CHOURINEUR OH THEY TALKED OF ALL MANNER OF THINGS,--OF BRAS ROUGE AND THE RAIN AND FINE WEATHER DO THEY KNOW BRAS ROUGE NOT BY NO MEANS
THUS TO TO ABUSE MY POWER REPEATED RODOLPH IN A SOLEMN VOICE
I'LL STAKE MY BLESSED LIFE UPON IT WHILE MADAME PIPELET THUS VENTED HER INDIGNANT OPINION CONCERNING THE REPORTS IN CIRCULATION RODOLPH RECALLED TO HIS MEMORY THE LETTER HE HAD SEEN ADDRESSED TO THE QUACK DENTIST
DE ST REMY WILL DULY AND AFFECTIONATELY SYMPATHISE IN ALL HER REGRETS ON THE SUBJECT COME COME MY DEAR SARAH I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SCANDALISE
THE WORTHY GENTLEMAN LET GO THE ARM OF GOUALEUSE AND SAID TO RODOLPH IN A LOW VOICE AND WITH AN AIR OF SOME CONFUSION
OH HOW DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE SOME ONE TO LOVE US AND YOU RETURN THE TENDER AFFECTION SHE BEARS YOU OH WITH ALL MY HEART EXCLAIMED FLEUR-DE-MARIE CLASPING HER HANDS AND RAISING HER EYES TO HEAVEN WITH AN EXPRESSION IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE
SEE SHE EXCLAIMED AFTER INTENTLY WATCHING THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT UNFOLDED THEMSELVES TO HER EAGER LOOK SEE HOW BEAUTIFULLY THE CLEAR WHITE SMOKE RISES FROM THOSE COTTAGES AND ASCENDS TO THE VERY CLOUDS THEMSELVES
ONE DAY OUR SERGEANT HAD BULLIED ME A GOOD DEAL TO MAKE ME MORE ATTENTIVE,--HE WAS RIGHT FOR I WAS VERY SLOW
THE JUNCTION OF TWO SUCH EVIL SPIRITS IS INDEED TO BE FEARED FOR WHAT FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES MIGHT THERE NOT RESULT FROM IT
BUT ALAS
A CHARCOAL-MAN VERY TALL AND STOUT CAME IN AND SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM AND THEY LEFT TOGETHER THE VERY MAN WE WANT TO MEET SAID TOM
WE MUST PASS BY A HOUSE IN RUINS TO REACH THE FIACRE
YET YESTERDAY I SEEMED TO BE MORE YOUR EQUAL THEN AS IF CORRECTING HERSELF AND FEARING TO HAVE ANNOYED RODOLPH SHE SAID TO HIM WHEN I SAY YOUR EQUAL M
THIS TIME THE GRAND DUKE'S CHOICE WAS A MOST UNFORTUNATE ONE OR RATHER HIS RELIGIOUS FEELINGS WERE INFAMOUSLY IMPOSED UPON BY THE PERSON WHO INTRODUCED THE DOCTOR TO HIM AND CAUSED HIM TO THINK ON POLIDORI AS THE PRECEPTOR OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
BUT SHE LOOKED AT FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITH A TENDERNESS AND COMPASSION QUITE MATERNAL SO MUCH GENTLENESS AND SWEETNESS DID THIS POOR GIRL EVINCE
I ONLY WISHED TO SEE YOU ROUSED FROM YOUR LOW SPIRITS AND YET I ADD TO THEM BY MY FOOLISH TENACIOUSNESS
STILL FURTHER REASSURED BY THE MILD TONE IN WHICH RODOLPH HAD ADDRESSED HIM THE RUFFIAN ASSUMED HIS USUALLY INSOLENT AIR AND MANNER AS HE SAID BURSTING INTO A LOUD AND VULGAR LAUGH
I NEVER CAN BELIEVE THEM
NOW YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER FIT WHICH IS BAD FOR YOU AND VERY DISAGREEABLE TO ME BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU ABUSE MY FRIENDS
AND THEN IN THE MORNING IN THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE TO SEIZE AN OX BY THE HORNS PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S FIERCE,--_NOM DE NOM HE MUST BE FIERCE!--THEN TO PUT ON THE RING TO CLEAVE HIM DOWN CUT HIM UP DRESS HIM,--_TONNERRE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY AMBITION AS IT WAS THE GOUALEUSE'S TO SUCK BARLEY-SUGAR WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE UN
HE GOT IN HIMSELF SAYING TO THE DRIVER
I KNOW TOO WELL WHAT IT IS TO STRUGGLE WITH A HIDDEN GRIEF YET WEAR AN OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF CALMNESS AND RESIGNATION
ONE STRONG RAY OF LIGHT FALLING STRAIGHT DOWN LIGHTED UP A LA REMBRANDT THE RUGGED FEATURES OF THE CHOURINEUR HIS LIGHT HAIR AND HIS RED WHISKERS
RODOLPH NO YOU SURELY WILL NOT LET HIM GO
MURPHY WHICH WAS THE NAME OF THIS PERSONAGE WAS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
WHAT WILL YOU SAY I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN YOU WILL HAVE A STOVE UNDER YOUR PADDLERS AND A CHINCHILLA BOA LIKE THE OGRESS OH I SHALL NEVER BE SO OLD AS SHE IS PERHAPS YOU HAVE A CHARM FOR NEVER GROWING ANY OLDER NO
RODOLPH HE WILL HEAR I FULLY BELIEVE
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ACT OF PARLIAMENT WHY MY PIPELET SHOULD NOT BE CALLED ALFRED IS THERE PRAY NONE CERTAINLY MADAME THAT I AM AWARE OF
YOU APPROVED ENTIRELY OF MY ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS FARM AND THE DEEP INTEREST I HAVE ALWAYS FELT IN MADAME GEORGES
WHEN THEY LEAVE THE CRIB WE WILL BE ON THEIR LAY AND DRAW THE FLAT OF HIS BLUNT AS HIS MOT IS WITH HIM HE'LL HOLD HIS JAW IF TOM AND SARAH HAD HEARD THIS FOUL LANGUAGE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT AND WOULD NOT HAVE DETECTED THE PLOT AGAINST THEM
NO REPLIED MADAME D'HARVILLE IN A TONE OF EMBARRASSMENT
TO CLIMB OVER THE WALL PICK THE LOCK OF THE DOOR OR FORCE OPEN A SHUTTER OR LOCK
WHEN RODOLPH APPROACHED THE BRIGAND MADE HIM A POLITE BOW AND THE CHOUETTE CURTSEYED RESPECTFULLY
BUT TO HAVE THEM ARRESTED THAT I WILL NOT HAVE A HAND IN NOR I MY BOY
IT COMES FROM THE COMMANDANT
YOU SAY THAT IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AT NO
CHARLES
THE BLACKS OF MR WILLIS LOVED DAVID WITH ALL THE WARMTH OF GRATITUDE FOR HE HAD SAVED THEM BODY AND SOUL
YOU LITTLE CHATTERER BE QUIET WILL YOU YES I AM A CHATTERER INDEED TO INTERRUPT YOU SO OFTEN M
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS WATCHING US SAID THE PORTER
THE SECRET IS MINE AND MY FOURLINE'S AND I WILL TEAR OUT HIS TONGUE RATHER THAN HE SHALL BLAB IT
I WAS WRONG
BY THE WAY THAT POOR GIRL M
BUT UNHAPPILY THE CHOURINEUR WAS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE LAWS OF THE LEVER AND THE EQUILIBRIUM OF BODIES THE CHAIR OVERBALANCED AND THE LUCKLESS INDIVIDUAL SEATED THEREON IN ENDEAVOURING TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING BY AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT CAUGHT HOLD OF A SMALL STAND ON WHICH WAS A TRAY CONTAINING SOME TEA-THINGS
OH IF YOU BUT KNEW HOW OVER-SUSCEPTIBLE SOME MINDS ARE RENDERED BY A CONTINUANCE OF SORROWS AND AFFLICTIONS,--JUST NOW I SAW TWO LARGE TEARS FALL FROM HIS EYES AS HE GAZED ON YOU ARE YOU QUITE SURE OF WHAT YOU SAY INDEED I AM QUITE CERTAIN
AND I--I AM THE WRETCHED CAUSE OF IT CRIED RODOLPH IN A TONE OF AGONY RAISING HIS CLASPED HANDS TOWARDS HEAVEN
I AM STILL GIDDY FROM THEM
MY DEAR MURPHY I AM VERY SORRY THAT MADAME D'HARVILLE SHOULD HAVE FORMED ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS SARAH
THEY THREW HIM HELPLESS AND UNRESISTING INTO THE VEHICLE
I MAKE NO APOLOGIES TO YOU FOR THE SEVERE THINGS I HAVE SAID
SCARCELY HAD I CREPT INTO THE ROOM WHEN THE COMMANDANT CAUGHT ME IN HIS ARMS SAYING IN A LANGUISHING VOICE MY DEAREST ANGEL
WHO BUT I AND WHAT WAS YOUR TRADE FAITH MASTER I HAVE A FOGGY RECOLLECTION OF HAVING STROLLED ABOUT IN MY CHILDHOOD WITH AN OLD RAG-PICKER WHO ALMOST THUMPED ME TO DEATH
I LISTENED AND THE BARK CAME NEARER AND NEARER
NOW THEN TO WORK SAID HE
PIPELET ENTERED THE LODGE WITH A GRAVE MAGISTERIAL AIR
THE ARRIVAL OF THIS LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN APPEARED TO POLIDORI A GODSEND
JACQUES FERRAND EXCLAIMED RODOLPH SURPRISED AT THE FRESH COINCIDENCE WHICH BROUGHT UNDER HIS NOTICE THE VERY INDIVIDUAL FROM WHOM OR FROM WHOSE CONFIDENTIAL HOUSEKEEPER HE EXPECTED TO GLEAN SO MANY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO LA GOUALEUSE
HE MIND YE DRESSED AND LOOKING LIKE A REGULAR GENTLEMAN AND M
BUT STAY MY LORD CALL ME M
AND IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL TO SEE HOW REFRESHED AND STRENGTHENED POOR MOREL USED TO SEEM AFTER M
NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED MORE VENERABLE THAN HIS AGED WITHERED AND SOMEWHAT MELANCHOLY COUNTENANCE SHADED BY LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FELL ON THE COLLAR OF HIS BLACK CASSOCK WHICH WAS PIECED IN MORE PLACES THAN ONE
YES I CAN POSITIVELY SPEAK TO ITS CONTAINING FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS REPLIED THE CHOURINEUR SINCE I PUT THEM IN IT WITH MY OWN HAND
AND WITHOUT MY DREAMS OF THE SERGEANT AND SOLDIERS WITH THEIR THROATS CUT,--FOR I HAVE THE DREAM STILL SOMETIMES,--I COULD QUIETLY WAIT FOR THE MOMENT WHEN I SHOULD DROP DOWN DEAD AT THE CORNER OF SOME DUNGHILL LIKE THAT AT WHICH I WAS BORN
IT WAS ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO AN EXTREMITY AND FEARING ALAS
SHE INVENTED THIS TALE TO MAKE ME UNHAPPY YET THE CHOUETTE MAY KNOW MORE THAN YOU THINK
FOUR FRANCS A DAY I TELL YOU I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER
BUT HER BEAUTY DELICATE AND FRAGILE AS IT WAS APPEARED LESS TO BELONG TO THE STRICT REGULARITY OF HER FEATURES THAN TO THE IRRESISTIBLE EXPRESSION OF SWEETNESS AND UNIVERSAL KINDNESS WHICH IMPARTED A CHARM TO HER COUNTENANCE IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST OR TO DESCRIBE
I AM ONLY WAITING TO TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU DECIDE UPON GOING AND THEN ON GOES MY NIGHTCAP AND I GOES TO SLEEP BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHERE TO TAKE ME WHEN I DO NOT KNOW MYSELF
HE TRIED IN VAIN TO OPEN IT,--ITS MASSY HINGES RESISTED HIS MOST VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO FORCE THEM
WE'LL GO NOW AND LET HIM OUT WE WENT DOWN BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN
THE VAULT 166 XVI
LOUIS XV THE BIEN AIME THE WELL-BELOVED WAS AN UNANSWERABLE PROOF OF THIS
NOW INDEED HE COMPREHENDED ALL THE HORRORS OF HIS SITUATION
AND THEN CONTINUING HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER HE TOOK OUT A LEAD-PENCIL AND A MORSEL OF PAPER WHICH HE HAD IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET WITHOUT BEING DETECTED AND WROTE SOME WORDS HASTILY TAKING CARE TO MAKE HIS LETTERS WIDE APART SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE LEGIBLE
HIDE YOURSELF FIRST
I THOUGHT HE WAS A THOUSAND MILES OFF IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE HAD GONE SOMEWHERE IN THE EAST FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND BEHOLD AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS HERE HE IS BACK AGAIN
GOD KNOWS THE FEELING WHICH MAKES ME SHRINK FROM SUCH AN OUTRAGE TO MODESTY IS ALL MY WRETCHED FATE HAS LEFT ME THE MOURNFUL TONE IN WHICH THESE WORDS WERE UTTERED AND THE BITTER FEELINGS THEY CONTAINED WENT TO THE HEART OF RODOLPH
HE COULD NOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF RODOLPH
I SAW HER ONCE ADVANCE MONEY UPON A GRAY PARROT THAT SWORE LIKE A TROOPER,--THE BLACKGUARD DID A PARROT
IF I CANNOT HEAR ANYTHING THEN AS SOON AS THEY SEPARATE I WILL FOLLOW THE CHOUETTE WHO IS SURE TO STAY LAST AND I'LL PAY HER THE OLD GRUDGE I OWE HER FOR THE GOUALEUSE'S TOOTH
CALL YOU NOT THIS A CRIME THUS TO ABUSE YOUR POWER OVER ONE UNHAPPILY IN YOUR HANDS
RIGHT AND LEFT DOORS WITH SLIDING BOLTS WHICH OPEN BY A GENTLE PUSH FROM THE TOP
WE MAY GO AND LOOK ABOUT AS WE SEEK THE ALLEE DES VEUVES THE SERVANT ENTERED AND RODOLPH GAVE HER FIVE FRANCS
THAT YOU ARE ONLY LAYING A TRAP TO ENSNARE ME I AM NOT SUCH A SCOUNDREL AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR MISFORTUNE
YOUR TURN NEXT TIME BE IT SO BUT ON CONDITION THAT I SHALL OFFER YOU SOMETHING BY AND BY IN A LITTLE CABARET IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES,--A CAPITAL LITTLE SNUGGERY THAT I KNOW OF JUST AS YOU LIKE THE SERVANT PAID AND THEY LEFT THE ROOM
THE ARTERIES OF HIS TEMPLES BEAT VIOLENTLY HIS HEAD BECAME GIDDY AND THE FAINT SICKNESS OF DEATH SEEMED TO MAKE HIS CHEST HEAVE CONVULSIVELY
AND M
AND M
AND M
AND M
AND M
I HAVE NO MONEY REPLIED GOUALEUSE TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT FOR THIS MAN WAS THE DREAD OF THE DISTRICT
THE NEWCOMER WHO OBSERVED THE TWO MEN WAS SEATED TOO FAR OFF TO HEAR A WORD THEY SAID BUT AFTER HAVING CAUTIOUSLY CONSULTED A SMALL PAPER CONCEALED AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS CAP HE APPEARED SATISFIED WITH HIS REMARKS ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND SAID TO THE OGRESS WHO WAS SLEEPING AT THE BAR WITH HER FEET ON THE STOVE AND HER GREAT CAT ON HER KNEE
COME NOW YOU SHALL KEEP THE CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY AND I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER LOUIS AND NO MORE
BY THE LORD
HE BOARDS FOR THIRTY SOUS A DAY WITH GOOD PEOPLE TO WHOM THAT SUM IS OF MUCH SERVICE
HE SENT OFF AN EXPRESS FOR A DOCTOR BUT HE COULD NOT REACH HIS ABODE IN LESS THAN SIX AND THIRTY HOURS REALLY THIS ATTACK SEEMS PROVIDENTIAL
WE WILL INTRODUCE THE READER INTO THE HOTEL OF THE RUE PLUMET THE DAY AFTER THE CHOURINEUR HAD STARTED FOR ALGIERS
WHEN I FOUND THAT MY LIFE WOULD BE SPARED AND I WAS TO GO TO THE GALLEYS I WOULD HAVE JUMPED UPON THE BABBLING FOOL AND TWISTED HIS NECK AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE CAME TO WISH ME JOY AND TO TELL ME HE HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND BE HANGED TO HIM
CESAR BRADAMANTI WHO IS THE BEST CREATURE POSSIBLE
HER EYES TOO SEEM TO ME TO HAVE A BRILLIANCY WHICH BETOKENS A FEVERISH SYSTEM
MON DIEU HAVE PITY ON HIM EXCLAIMED LA GOUALEUSE WHO DURING THE CONTEST HAD VENTURED ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE ALLEY ADDING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT BUT WHO ARE YOU THEN
THE INCOGNITO OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WAS CLOSELY KEPT
BUT SUCH UNFORTUNATELY WAS THE ESQUIRE'S INTERPRETATION OF THEM
BE QUIET FOURLINE ANSWERED THE CHOUETTE
TO SAY NOTHING OF HIS LIPS WHICH ARE AS THICK AS YOUR FIST AND HIS FACE WHICH IS AS WRINKLED AS THE WAISTCOAT OF A RAG-PICKER AND SO HE IS NOT RECOGNISED IT IS SIX MONTHS SINCE HE ESCAPED FROM ROCHEFORT AND THE TRAPS HAVE MET HIM A HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT KNOWING HIM WHY WAS HE AT THE BAGNE FOR HAVING BEEN A FORGER THIEF AND ASSASSIN
THE CHOUETTE SHALL NOT GO SCOT FREE FOR ME
THESE REPUGNANCES THESE POWERFUL AND WHOLESOME ADMONITIONS TOOK DEEP AND LASTING ROOT IN THE VERY SOUL OF RODOLPH
HOW DO I KNOW WHAT DEVIL'S TRICK YOU ARE PLANNING AT THIS MOMENT TRY TO FORGET ALL THAT IS PAST,--IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW
ADIEU SO SAYING RODOLPH LEFT THE LODGE
AND IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE HOLE THEY ARE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN--BUT DO NOT LET US TALK ANY MORE ABOUT THAT MONSIEUR FOR OUR DINNER IS READY AND THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEIR WRETCHED GARRET TURNS MY STOMACH
WHEN THE CHOUETTE BEAT ME I FELL ALWAYS AT THE FIRST BLOW
HE PERCEIVED THAT SOME OF THE LETTERS IN THE DIRECTION WERE FAINTER THAN THE OTHERS AND THAT THE PAPER THERE SEEMED A LITTLE RUMPLED
YOUR LANGUAGE TOO WILL BE CHANGED AND GOOD AND PRAYERFUL WORDS TAKE PLACE OF THOSE DARING AND BLASPHEMOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH NOW DISGRACE YOUR LIPS
AH MY PRETTY FAIR MISS YOU MUST QUIT THESE TWO MUFFS AND COME WITH ME THE GOUALEUSE MADE NO REPLY BUT CLUNG TO RODOLPH HER TEETH CHATTERING WITH FRIGHT
AND IF THE COVE COMES WITH A COMPANION HE WON'T FIND ANYBODY
FOR TRUTH TO SAY I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY BUT AS I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE I FEEL AS IF I WERE YOUR BULLDOG
WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT HE CONTRIVED TO SEAT HIMSELF ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STAIRCASE
ABANDONED TO HER OWN INSTINCT,--WHO TORTURED IMPRISONED DEGRADED SULLIED HAS YET PRESERVED IN HOLINESS AND PURENESS OF HEART THOSE NOBLE GERMS OF GOOD FIRST IMPLANTED BY THE ALMIGHTY
13 THAT MY LORD FELL IN WITH THE CHOURINEUR AND LA GOUALEUSE
TO SUCCOUR UNHAPPY BUT DESERVING FELLOW CREATURES IS WELL
YOU WILL ENTRUST ME WITH ALL THE PARTICULARS YOU HAVE ACQUIRED AND I WILL COMMUNICATE THEM TO MONSEIGNEUR WHEN HE WAKES
A VERY CLEVER INDIVIDUAL IS M
WHEN I SAY I HAD NO ONE TO ADVISE ME I AM WRONG
BUT AT THE END OF TWO YEARS I WAS TIRED OF GOING ALWAYS AROUND LIKE A SQUIRREL IN HIS CAGE AND DRAWING STONE FOR TWENTY SOUS A DAY
YOU MET THE CHOURINEUR THEN AT ST OUEN FOR RODOLPH AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO THINK OF A STORY WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE WANT OF ADDRESS WHICH THE CHOURINEUR HAD DISPLAYED AND SAID
THE DESCRIPTION OF MADAME PIPELET MAY BE GIVEN IN A FEW WORDS
THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE LAMPS REVEALED THE COSTLY SATIN LINING OF THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE WE ARE DESCRIBING IN WHICH WERE SEATED RODOLPH HAVING ON HIS RIGHT HAND THE BARON DE GRAUEN AND OPPOSITE TO HIM THE FAITHFUL MURPHY
HE SUNK SUBDUED ON A STONE BENCH AND CONCEALED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH BOTH HIS HANDS
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED SAY
THE COMPLEXION OF MADAME D'HARVILLE WAS OF THE PUREST WHITE TINGED WITH THE MOST DELICATE CARNATION
THE BEGGARS
PERHAPS YOU WILL ACCOMPANY ME AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
THE VEHICLE FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS OF RODOLPH RAPIDLY DESCENDED THE HILL AND ENTERED A LONG AVENUE BORDERED WITH APPLE AND CHERRY TREES WHILE THE WHEELS ROLLED NOISELESSLY OVER THE SHORT FINE GRASS WITH WHICH THE UNFREQUENTED ROAD WAS OVERGROWN
BUT WHEN ONE IS MERELY WISHING THERE IS NO HARM IN ADDING A FEW SUPERFLUITIES
THE OTHER PRIGS BULLIED ME
BUT WHEN SEVEN PERSONS HAVE TO LIVE UPON IT IT DOES NOT GO FAR BUT WHAT DOES THE FATHER EARN,--I MEAN PROVIDED HE IS INDUSTRIOUS INDUSTRIOUS
THAT ALL COMES TO ABOUT THIRTY-FOUR OR THIRTY-FIVE SOUS A DAY
AS SHE WILL BE VERY SAVAGE AT HAVING MISSED THE GOOD HAUL SHE EXPECTED YOU MUST TRY AND SMOOTH HER DOWN BY TELLING HER THAT YOU KNOW OF A CAPITAL BIT OF BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE DONE AND THAT YOU ARE THEN WAITING FOR YOUR COMRADE AND THAT IF THE SCHOOLMASTER WILL JOIN YOU THERE IS A LUMP OF MONEY TO BE MADE WELL WELL AFTER WAITING WITH HER FOR AN HOUR YOU MAY SAY MY MATE DOES NOT COME AND SO THE JOB MUST BE PUT OFF AND THEN YOU MAY MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE CHOUETTE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER FOR TO-MORROW AT AN EARLY HOUR
I MUST BE DREAMING SURELY
HIS EYES WERE LARGE AND OF A DEEP HAZEL HIS NOSE AQUILINE HIS CHIN RATHER PROJECTING HIS HAIR BRIGHT CHESTNUT OF THE SAME SHADE AS HIS EYEBROWS WHICH WERE STRONGLY ARCHED AND HIS SMALL MOUSTACHE WHICH WAS FINE AND SILKY
THERE IS INDEED NOTHING BUT WHAT IS QUITE NATURAL IN ALL THIS THE FARM TO WHICH RODOLPH HAD CONDUCTED FLEUR-DE-MARIE WAS SITUATED AT THE OUTER EXTREMITY OF THE VILLAGE OF BOUQUEVAL,--A SMALL ISOLATED AND UNKNOWN HAMLET ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY ITS OWN LANDS AND ABOUT TWO LEAGUES DISTANCE FROM ECOUEN
THIS IS NOT ALL
AND DOES NOT THE GENTLE ELEGANCE OF HER WHOLE APPEARANCE ACQUIRE A FRESH CHARM FROM THE CONTRAST WITH THE SEVERE YET CLASSIC BEAUTY BY WHOM SHE IS ACCOMPANIED THE INDIVIDUALS THUS ALLUDED TO WERE THE COUNTESS SARAH MACGREGOR AND THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE WHO WERE AT THIS MOMENT DESCENDING THE STEPS WHICH LED FROM THE GALLERY TO THE WINTER GARDEN
AT LAST I STUMBLED UPON HIM AND THAT OLD DEVIL'S KIN CHOUETTE IN THE FRONT OF NOTRE DAME AT THE SHOP OF A TAILOR WHO IS A FENCE'[8 AND THIEF
SARAH WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE BEST SOCIETY AND THE HIGHEST CIRCLES THANKS TO THE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION AND CONSIDERATE PATRONAGE OF THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR'S LADY AND THE OLD MARQUIS D'HARVILLE WHO HAD KNOWN TOM AND SARAH'S FATHER IN ENGLAND
AT LAST WHEN I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER I USED TO WAKE COVERED ALL OVER WITH SWEAT AS COLD AS MELTING SNOW THAT WAS A HORRID DREAM CHOURINEUR IT WAS
RODOLPH NODDED HIS HEAD IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
WHEN FLEUR-DE-MARIE COULD SPEAK SHE SAID TO RODOLPH WITH AN ACCENT OF SUPREME HAPPINESS AND OF GRATITUDE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO PIETY
DID YOU SEE HIM MA FOI HE PASSED SO VERY QUICKLY SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER THAT I DID NOT REMARK HIM RODOLPH CALMLY CONCEALED HIS SATISFACTION
DO YOU SEE HER YOUNG MAN
ATTEND TO YOUR AFFAIRS AND I WILL MIND MINE AT WHAT O'CLOCK HAVE YOU ORDERED THE HORSES ACCORDING TO YOUR DIRECTIONS,--AT NIGHTFALL YOU GOT HERE THIS MORNING I SUPPOSE I DID AT EIGHT O'CLOCK
PALE WAN MEAGRE HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS DAVID AND THE UNHAPPY GIRL CHAINED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE BODY ONE AT ONE END AND THE OTHER AT THE OTHER END OF THE DUNGEON LOOKED LIKE SPECTRES
DEVIL A BIT
COME IN AND LET US HAVE A GLASS TOGETHER THE CHOURINEUR SAID IN A LOW VOICE TO RODOLPH AND THE GOUALEUSE POINTING TO THE NEWCOMER WE SHALL HAVE A ROW
THE CHOUETTE FUMBLED IN HER BASKET AND THEN PRODUCING A LUCIFER-MATCH LIGHTED A WAX TAPER WHOSE FEEBLE RAY MADE VISIBLE THE DARKNESS OF THIS DREARY DEN
IS IT THE DEVIL WHO SENDS YOU BACK AND SHE SHOOK HER CLENCHED HAND AT THE YOUNG GIRL
I WOULD GO IF I WERE YOU
ALTHOUGH ALWAYS SHADED BY THE HEIGHT OF THE HOUSES THE DISREPUTABLE NEIGHBOURHOOD INTO WHICH THE READER HAS FOLLOWED US SEEMED LESS HORRIBLE WHEN VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF OPEN DAY
FOR SO WELL DID YOU ACT UP TO YOUR CHARACTER OF THE PRINCE'S SWORN FOE AND SUCH FEARFUL TALES DID YOU TELL ME OF HIS PROFLIGACY AND MISCONDUCT THAT YOU SUCCEEDED IN INSPIRING ME WITH AN AVERSION AS POWERFUL AS HAD BEEN THE INFATUATION WHICH LED YOU TO FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY HEART
AND ONCE IN THAT SINK IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT HAS THE FIST STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL YOU OUT AGAIN MY WORTHY FELLOW YOU CANNOT PROVE YOUR GRATITUDE MORE THAN IN SPEAKING TO ME THUS SO MUCH THE BETTER MY LORD
INSTANTLY HE TURNS DOWN HIS SHIRT-COLLAR ADOPTS POETICAL LANGUAGE AND WRITES HIMSELF POET
AND HE MY FAITHFUL FRIEND WILL DIE MY LORD YES YOU ARE SEEKING TO DECEIVE ME TILL ALL IS OVER
FAREWELL MARIE
HE PLACED HIS HAT ON A CHAIR AND TOOK HIS STATION NEAR THE FIREPLACE WHILST MURPHY CONTINUED HIS WORK
THUS NOT ALONE TO HER VIRTUES OR HER MISFORTUNES DOES POOR MADAME GEORGES OWE THE INCREASING AND UNWEARIED GOODNESS OF MY LORD MADAME GEORGES EXCLAIMED THE ASTOUNDED BARON
YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY MY SIGHT
LITERALLY A FREE CARPET A LOW HAUNT EQUIVALENT TO WHAT IN ENGLISH SLANG IS TERMED A BOOZING KEN ALTHOUGH LIMITED IN SPACE AND CAREFULLY WATCHED THIS QUARTER SERVES AS THE LURKING-PLACE OR RENDEZVOUS OF A VAST NUMBER OF THE VERY DREGS OF SOCIETY IN PARIS WHO FLOCK TO THE TAPIS-FRANC
WELL MY LORD THIS IS A POINT ON WHICH WE CANNOT AGREE AND THEREFORE LET US SPEAK NO MORE ABOUT IT I DESIRE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT CRIED RODOLPH IMPERIOUSLY
BRAS ROUGE IS IN HIS
HE IS SO VERY NICE AND PARTICULAR IN SHOWING ALL THOSE SORT OF DELICATE ATTENTIONS TO WOMEN THEN GO ALONG MY GOOD MADAME PIPELET AND WE WILL WAIT TILL ALFRED COMES BUT THEN SUPPOSE ANY ONE WANTS ME WHILST I AM OUT WHO WILL MIND THE LODGE OH I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE LODGE THE OLD WOMAN DEPARTED ON HER AGREEABLE ERRAND
I ENTERED AND TOOK MY SEAT NEAR THE WINDOW IN A ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR
THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD PENETRATED HIS DESIGN
BUT UP TO THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE BOTH USELESS AND UNNECESSARY
THE COSTUME WAS WELL CALCULATED TO DISPLAY THE ELEGANT SHAPE AND CARRIAGE OF RODOLPH WHICH COMBINED SO MUCH GRACE SUPPLENESS AND POWER
HIS HAIR GRAY FRIZZLED AND POWDERED
FOR ALFRED IS AS JEALOUS AS A TURK HERE IS ANOTHER LETTER ADDRESSED TO M
WAS I MISTAKEN NOT AT ALL MISTAKEN MY LORD
RODOLPH I'M HAVING A HOLIDAY OH
SOME DAYS AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SARAH AND HER BROTHER AT THE COURT OF THE GRAND DUKE POLIDORI BECAME A CLOSE ALLY OF SEYTON'S
BRAS ROUGE AND HE LIVES RUE AUX FEVES NO
FOR MY OWN PART I ALWAYS THOUGHT WITH YOU THAT M
INDEED I DARE NOT LISTEN FURTHER
THERE IS STILL TIME AND IF THIS PROPOSITION FOR ALGIERS DOES NOT SUIT YOU TELL ME SO FRANKLY AND WE WILL LOOK OUT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
A STIFF WHITE CRAVAT ROUND HIS THROAT
EVERY MAN HAS A RIGHT TO HIS OWN FREE WILL AS WELL AS TO DECIDE UPON THE NAME HE CHOOSES TO BE CALLED WHAT DO YOU THINK M
BUT YOU SEE THERE ARE LUCKY AND UNLUCKY PEOPLE
REMEMBERING THE TOOTH OF THE POOR DEAR GOUALEUSE I GRASPED HER ARM AND TWISTED IT SAYING WHERE IS M
HIS THICK BUSHY HAIR WAS TANGLED WITH MUD AND WET WHICH STILL DRIPPED FROM IT
WHY IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE WE HEARD ANYTHING OF YOU
DOES THE WOMAN WHO IS SO STYLED COME HERE FREQUENTLY WE SAW HER THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THESE SIX WEEKS
WILL IT NOT RETURN TO FETCH US AWAY OF COURSE NOT
BUT HE WAS DRUNK,--IT WAS NO LIE
LET THE READER IMAGINE AN ENCLOSURE OF ABOUT FORTY FEET IN LENGTH AND THIRTY IN WIDTH LEADING OUT OF A LONG AND SPLENDID GALLERY SURMOUNTED BY A GLAZED AND VAULTED ROOF THE BUILDING BEING SECURELY COVERED IN FOR ABOUT FIFTY FEET
FREED FELONS THIEVES AND ASSASSINS ARE THERE FAMILIAR GUESTS
SHE WILL FIND SOME INTEREST IN YOUR HEART YES I SHALL OCCUPY MY HEART WITH HER AS I SHOULD WITH HIM SAID MADAME GEORGES IN A BROKEN VOICE
BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY DEAR CHILD
IF THEY TURN TO THE LEFT WE CAN DOUBLE UPON THEM AT THE TURNING OF THE RUE SAINT ELOI
RODOLPH ONE MIGHT LEAD SUCH A LIFE AS THAT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WITHOUT EVER KNOWING ONE MOMENT'S WEARINESS BUT THAT IS NOT ALL
I NEVER FELT SO FRIGHTENED
YOU HAVE COME NO DOUBT FOR YOUR CHANGE OF THE TWENTY FRANCS SHE SAID WITH SOME SHOW OF RESPECT NOT VENTURING TO FORGET THAT THE CONQUEROR OF THE CHOURINEUR HAD HANDED HER A LOUIS D'OR THE PREVIOUS EVENING
AH THAT WAS MY MISTAKE ADDED FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITH A SIGH
AND ADVANCING TOWARDS MURPHY WITH A THREATENING ASPECT HE EXCLAIMED DARE YOU MURPHY RETREATED AND SAID IN A QUICK TONE AND AS IF IN SPITE OF HIMSELF MY LORD MY LORD REMEMBER THE THIRTEENTH OF JANUARY THESE WORDS PRODUCED A MAGICAL EFFECT ON RODOLPH
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE REALLY EXCLAIMED THE POOR GIRL CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH JOY
THANKS FOR MARIE MY DEAR MADAME GEORGES
YOUR CRIMES DEMAND A STRIKING REPARATION
THAT WAS MY INHERITANCE AND WHO IS NOW YOUR EMPLOYER THE CHOURINEUR DEMANDED
ONLY CONCEIVE SIR THE ABOMINABLE CONDUCT OF THAT CABRION WHO FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AT ALL HOURS AND AT ALL TIMES SENDS A SWARM OF VAGABONDS LIKE HIMSELF TO ASK ALFRED FOR A LOCK OF HIS HAIR,--ALWAYS FOR CABRION AH MONSIEUR SIGHED OUT POOR PIPELET HAD I COMMITTED THE MOST ATROCIOUS CRIMES MY SLEEP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN RENDERED MORE BROKEN AND UNREFRESHING
I SAY CERTAINLY M
I QUITE FORGOT THAT WELL THEN THE GROUND FLOOR CONTAINS TWO ROOMS
I WONDER HOW I CAN DO SO!--TO BE ABLE EVEN TO RECOLLECT MY MISERY WHEN ALL AROUND ME SMILES AND LOOKS SO GAY
IT WAS THAT IN WHICH HE HELD HIS DAGGER
COACHMAN STOP WHAT
I DO NOT BELIEVE THEM FOR ONE
RODOLPH NEXT TRIED THE POWERS OF HIS VOICE AND SHOUTED WITH THE FULLEST EXPANSION OF HIS LUNGS TRUSTING THAT HIS CRIES FOR ASSISTANCE MIGHT REACH THE ADJOINING CABARET
BUT THIS COLONIST WAS AS STUPID MALEVOLENT SELFISH AND DESPOTIC AS MOST CREOLES ARE AND HE THOUGHT HIMSELF VERY GENEROUS IN GIVING DAVID SIX HUNDRED FRANCS 24_L A YEAR SALARY
RODOLPH FELT AN UNDEFINABLE CURIOSITY TO KNOW
IT IS A REGULAR OMNIBUS
I SAW YOUR TWO POOR ARMS IN THE AIR
THE BANDIT STUMBLED
I WAS SENT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL AND SENTENCED AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND TO REMAIN UNTIL I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE IN A HOUSE OF CORRECTION
OH I DECLARE HERE COMES ALFRED EXCLAIMED THE PORTERESS
IN TWO WORDS MASTER I'LL TELL YOU ALL
HE IS STRICTLY RELIGIOUS AND DEVOUT AS A MONK
YES MY BOYS THIS SPRINGALD HAS FLOORED ME
I REPEAT TO YOU THAT THIS PROSPECT FOR YOU WOULD PLEASE ME VERY MUCH IN SPITE OF OR RATHER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DANGER
THE VEHICLE HAD BY THIS TIME ALMOST ARRIVED AT ST DENIS AND THE TALL SPIRES OF THE CATHEDRAL WERE VISIBLE
FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST YOU PAID ME TWO BLOWS OF THE FIST WHICH WERE ENOUGH TO HAVE FELLED A RHINOCEROS
THE MAN IN THE CARTER'S FROCK STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ONE OF THESE CREATURES SILENT AND SAD AS SHE GAZED SEIZED HER BY THE ARM AND SAID HA
RIGOLETTE AND M
THE IDEA OF MAKING YOU LAY BY FORTY SOUS A DAY THINKING YOU A WORKMAN INSTEAD OF URGING YOU TO SPEND MONEY ON HER
AND DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN SUCH A TERRIBLE WAY,--IT IS REALLY VERY BAD FOR YOU
OH IF YOU KNEW HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO HEAR YOU SAY SO
AND NEITHER OF THE PERSONAGES I HAVE MENTIONED HAVE THE SMALLEST INTEREST IN BETRAYING THE SECRET AH
RODOLPH SAW TOO MANY REASONS FOR DESIRING TO OBTAIN THIS LODGING TO HESITATE FURTHER
BUT BY A MOST EXTRAORDINARY REVULSION OF CONDUCT HARDLY WAS SHE IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF AN UNHOPED-FOR POSITION WHEN FORGETTING ALL THAT DAVID HAD SUFFERED FOR HER AND WHAT SHE HAD SUFFERED FOR HIM BLUSHING IN THE NEW WORLD TO BE WEDDED TO A BLACK CECILY SEDUCED BY A MAN OF MOST DEPRAVED MORALS COMMITTED HER FIRST FAULT
NOT CONTENT WITH YOUR GENEROUS DEFENCE OF ME YESTERDAY YOU HAVE TO-DAY PROCURED FOR ME HAPPINESS SUCH AS I NEVER HOPED TO ENJOY YOU ARE THEN TRULY AND ENTIRELY HAPPY NEVER NEVER SHALL I FORGET TO-DAY HAPPINESS DOES NOT OFTEN ATTEND US ON EARTH SAID RODOLPH SIGHING
POOR LITTLE MITE
THOUGH THEY IN REALITY CONSTITUTE THE CHARM OF A LANDSCAPE AND RODOLPH WAS RIGHT
RODOLPH TOLD ME SO I CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT PASSED WITHIN ME
AND I AM SURE I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO TELL YOU ALL I KNOW MYSELF AND THAT IS BUT VERY LITTLE
BUT MOTHER PONISSE DOUBTLESS ANXIOUS TO PAY PROPER RESPECT TO HER OWN CELLAR HAD FREQUENTLY FILLED AND EMPTIED HERS
IT WAS RAINING STILL AND THE NIGHT WAS VERY DARK
DON'T YOU THINK SO M
THE VERY CLOTHES I HAVE ON ARE HERS AND BESIDES I OWE HER MAKE YOURSELF QUITE EASY MY DEAR CHILD
WE HAVE SAID THAT GOUALEUSE WAS SITTING ON THE TRUNK OF A FALLEN TREE AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP DITCH
FOR SOME MINUTES SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITH FIXED AND INCREASING ATTENTION AS IF TRYING TO REFRESH HER MEMORY
AND ONLY LET ME ONCE GET HER TO OUR PLACE AND I'LL RUB HER CHOPS WITH MY VITRIOL AND THEN MY LADY WILL NO LONGER BE PROUD OF HER FINE SKIN WELL SAID CHOUETTE
I NEVER ROBBED IN MY LIFE
NEVER THE LEAST SOIL OR NEGLECT ABOUT EITHER HERSELF OR HER APARTMENT AND SO YOU WILL FIND AND SO M
STRANGE TO SAY THOMAS SEYTON AS SUPERSTITIOUS AS HIS SISTER ENCOURAGED HER FOOLISH HOPES AND RESOLVED ON DEVOTING HIS LIFE TO THE REALISATION OF SARAH'S DREAM,--A DREAM AS DAZZLING AS IT WAS DECEPTIVE
I WILL SEND KARL THITHER TO-MORROW AS YOU KNOW M
RODOLPH HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE PARIS SOME DAYS AFTER THE AFFAIR OF THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AND HE FORGOT YOU MY MAN WELL M
THE FOREHEAD OF THE BRAT WAS HALF LOST BENEATH A THATCH OF YELLOWISH LOCKS AS HARSH AND STIFF AS HORSE-HAIR
SEYTON WAS PREPARED TO AID HIS SISTER SARAH IN SNATCHING AT THE THREAD OF THE CONJUGAL BAND BY WHICH SHE HOPED EVENTUALLY TO FASTEN A CROWN UPON HER BROWS
HERE ARE THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GLEAN CONCERNING FRANCOIS GERMAIN SON OF MADAME GEORGES AND THE SCHOOLMASTER PROPERLY CALLED DURESNEL
HE FELT IMPRESSED WITH SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT THERE WAS A WIDE ABYSS BETWEEN RODOLPH AND HIMSELF
EXCEPT THE SCHOOLMASTER AND SKELETON THERE IS NO ONE FROM THE RUE SAINT ELOI TO NOTRE DAME WHO CAN STAND AGAINST THE CHOURINEUR
THE STAIRCASE IS AS BLACK AS NIGHT AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE APARTMENT QUITE AS OBSCURE
AT THE LEFT-HAND CORNER OF THE WALL A FIR-TREE JUST LIKE A LADDER,--A LYING-IN WOMAN MIGHT DESCEND BY IT
RIGOLETTE IS FAMILIAR TO YOU IS IT
WELL SAID THE GOUALEUSE I RETURNED VERY VERY TIRED
SO IT IS AND SO LET IT BE IF IT'S ANY GOOD TO YOU MANY THANKS MY MAN
IF I DESCEND TO FAMILIARITY WITH YOU SIR IT IS ON CONDITION THAT YOU AT LEAST ACT WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS TOWARDS ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EXTREME HAUTEUR WHICH MARKED THE COUNTENANCE OF RODOLPH AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS
NOW TOUCHING THE FACTS YOU HAVE BEEN COLLECTING HAVE YOU THEM ABOUT YOU HERE SAID THE BARON DRAWING A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET ARE THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO COLLECT TOUCHING THE BIRTH OF A YOUNG GIRL KNOWN AS LA GOUALEUSE AND ALSO OF THE NOW RESIDENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL CALLED FRANCOIS GERMAIN SON OF THE SCHOOLMASTER BE KIND ENOUGH TO READ ME THE RESULT OF YOUR INQUIRIES MY DEAR DE GRAUEN
AS WELL AS THOSE WHO PREFER SUGAR AND THOSE WHO CHOOSE PEPPER
BUT FROM THAT DAY I SAID TO MY WIFE ANASTASIA M
I SAID TO HER YOU MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH ASTONISHED AND VERY HAPPY WHEN M
WITH ONE SPRING HE CARRIED IT OFF AS A WOLF WOULD DO BOUNDING TOWARDS HIS LAIR WITH HIS PREY
WE HAD HIM IN A FIX WE KNEW WHERE HIS MADAME LIVED AND HAD HE SAID ANYTHING TO US WE SHOULD HAVE THREATENED TO EXPOSE THE WHOLE AFFAIR
RODOLPH WHAT DO YOU MEAN
RODOLPH SIGHED LA GOUALEUSE
SHALL WE SET FORTH ON OUR JOURNEY WE ARE GOING TO YOUR LODGING ARE WE NOT CHOURINEUR YES YES IF YOU ARE AGREEABLE AND YOU SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU BEAR ME NO ILL-WILL FOR THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWELVE HOURS SWEAR IT
LE DOCTEUR
RODOLPH IS THAT SHE HAS NOT ALLOWED ONE SINGLE QUESTION TO ESCAPE HER ABOUT YOU ALTHOUGH HER CURIOSITY MUST BE SO MUCH EXCITED
SUPPOSE ALFRED HAD HEARD YOU A PRETTY BUSINESS WE SHOULD HAVE MADE OF IT WHAT THE DEUCE BRINGS YOU HERE CRIED HE
I CANNOT PROCEED,--I DARE NOT MOVE
MASTER RODOLPH IS NO CHICKEN GIRL
WHO WERE YOUR FRIENDS ASKED THE GOUALEUSE
IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW HAPPY IT MADE ME,--I WAS NEVER TIRED OF LOOKING AT IT,--MY OWN ROSE-TREE
FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR A VERY LONG WHILE THE CHOURINEUR ENJOYED IN HIS DEN A COMFORTABLE SLEEP WHICH WAS NOT ONCE INTERRUPTED BY THE HORRIBLE VISION OF THE SERGEANT'S SLAUGHTER-HOUSE AS IN HIS COARSE LANGUAGE HE STYLED IT
AND IF SHE DOES HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE LEISURE SUCH A WASHING DOWN OF FLOORS AND CLEANING OF WINDOWS
THERE'S TENDER BITS OF CHICKEN BISCUIT SAUSAGE TARTS MUTTON-BONES PASTRY CRUST FRIED FISH VEGETABLES WOODCOCK'S HEADS CHEESE AND SALAD
WHAT HAVE THESE FELLOWS DONE MY DEAR M
WHAT A SINGULAR NAME IS BRAS ROUGE
IT IS IMPIETY,--VERY SACRILEGE
BUT DO YOU KNOW BRAS ROUGE IN WHOSE PASSAGE YOU WERE BRAS ROUGE SAID THE UNKNOWN WHO APPEARED DISAGREEABLY SURPRISED AT THE QUESTION
PERSONS OF DECEITFUL CALCULATING AND COLD DISPOSITIONS ACQUIRE WITH GREAT FACILITY LANGUAGE AND MANNERS QUITE IN OPPOSITION TO THEIR NATURAL CHARACTER AS WITH THEM ALL IS OUTSIDE SURFACE APPEARANCE VARNISH BARK
I ONLY SAID SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT GET INTO TROUBLE I AM SURE OF THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THE MAN RESUMED HIS PLACE GRUMBLING AS HE DID SO
YES MARIE HENCEFORWARD LET THAT NAME SIMPLE AND SWEET AS YOURSELF BE YOUR ONLY APPELLATION
FOR A MOMENT THE SAVAGE FEELING THE BLOODTHIRSTY INSTINCT HAD OVERCOME THE HUMAN BEING IN THE CHOURINEUR
I LOVE IT
THOMAS SEYTON A SECOND TIME AND WITH AN IMPATIENT TONE SAID WE HAVE CALLED FOR SOMETHING TO DRINK MA'AM
BESIDES THE LAW FORBIDS ANY ONE TO TAKE JUSTICE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH ASSURANCE
HOW LONG HAS THIS M
YOU RETIRE TO YOUR ROOM OFFER PRAYERS AND THANKSGIVINGS TO THE GREAT AUTHOR OF ALL YOUR HAPPINESS THEN SLEEP SOUNDLY TILL MORNING WHEN THE SAME ROUTINE BEGINS AGAIN OH M
THE CHOUETTE WILL NOT BE HERE FOR THE NEXT HALF-HOUR THE CHOUETTE CRIED RODOLPH AND THE GIRL BOTH AT ONCE
ONE EVENING HOWEVER HE NARROWLY ESCAPED FALLING INTO AN AMBUSH LAID FOR HIM THE SCHOOLMASTER CONCEALED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE FROM MY LORD BUT AGAIN PROVIDENCE BEFRIENDED HIM AND HE ESCAPED THOUGH TOO MUCH ALARMED TO REMAIN IN HIS LODGINGS
THE DEUCE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
THE SERGEANT
RODOLPH INVOLUNTARILY THOUGHT OF A BELOVED CHILD WHOM HE HAD LOST,--A GIRL DEAD AT SIX YEARS OF AGE AND WHO HAD SHE SURVIVED WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE FLEUR-DE-MARIE SIXTEEN YEARS AND A HALF OLD
IF TO THE RIGHT WE WILL WAIT FOR THEM BY THE RUINS CLOSE TO THE TRIPE-MARKET
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
WHERE IS SHE
BUT FINETTE SAID THE FELLOW GO AND SELECT A ROOM AT THE PANIER-FLEURI AND ORDER BREAKFAST,--SOME CUTLETS A PIECE OF VEAL A SALAD AND A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF VIN DE BEAUNE THE BEST QUALITY,--AND WE WILL JOIN YOU THERE THE CHOUETTE WHO HAD NOT TAKEN HER EYE OFF RODOLPH FOR A MOMENT WENT OFF AFTER EXCHANGING LOOKS WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO THEN SAID
FOR BETWEEN YOU AND I ADDED THE PORTERESS WITH AN UNCOMMONLY KNOWING WINK OF THE EYE AND SAGACIOUS SHAKE OF THE HEAD THERE IS SOMETHING RATHER TENDER GOING ON BETWEEN THESE TWO REALLY CRIED RODOLPH
RODOLPH MADE NO REPLY BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND POURING OUT A GLASS OF WINE TOSSED IT OFF
WELL THEN SHE FINDING THAT WHEN I CRIED I GOT MOST MONEY ALWAYS BEAT ME SEVERELY BEFORE SHE PUT ME ON THE BRIDGE BRUTAL BUT CUNNING WELL AT LAST I GOT HARDENED TO BLOWS
AND DO THESE MISERABLE ANTICIPATIONS OFTEN TROUBLE YOU MY POOR GIRL AH M
PERHAPS SO AND HE ONLY EXPECTS TO BE ASSAILED AT TEN O'CLOCK
SO PRECISE METHODICAL ZEALOUS AND INTELLIGENT
WOULD HE NOT BE A FITTING REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED FAMILIES IN FRANCE YOU KNOW MY DEAR COUNTESS HOW VERY LITTLE IMPORTANCE I ATTACH TO MERE BIRTH AND YOU YOURSELF HAVE FREQUENTLY REPROACHED ME WITH BEING STRONGLY INCLINED TO REPUBLICANISM SAID MADAME D'HARVILLE SMILING GENTLY
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR AFFAIRS
I HAD MY WAX IN MY BASKET SHE HAD HER WAX YOUNG MAN
ALL I WISH FOR IS MY FREE AND UNDISTURBED LIBERTY,--A COUNTRY LIFE AND THE CERTAINTY OF NOT DYING IN A HOSPITAL
AND THE MAN WHOSE SAINTLY TURN OF COUNTENANCE PERSUADES ITS OWNER INTO THE BELIEF OF A CORRESPONDING CHARACTER WITHIN FORTHWITH ABJURES THE POMPS AND VANITIES OF THE WORLD AND AIMS AT REFORMING HIS BRETHREN BY HIS PULPIT ELOQUENCE
YOU DID NOT EXPECT THAT I SHOULD PROPOSE THE AFFAIR TO YOU SO SOON AND IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE US YOU CANNOT PUT ANYBODY UP TO IT YOU MISTRUST ME THEN MOST EXTREMELY
EXCELLENT WOMAN
ALAS NO
THERE IS A CHILD SAID FINETTE
THIS FEARFUL IDEA HAS GLANCED ACROSS MY MIND ALREADY THEN AFTER A SECOND SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES THE MARQUISE RESUMED LET US AS I SAID BEFORE TALK OF SOMEBODY ELSE,--OF YOUR MORTAL ENEMY FOR INSTANCE ADDED SHE WITH ASSUMED GAIETY OF MANNER
LE MEDECIN HIS PULSE IS BECOMING REGULAR--VERY WELL INDEED--EXCELLENT AND THAT POOR FRIEND OF M
GUSTAVUS RODOLPH BORN 17TH APRIL 1803
BE OFF WITHOUT LOOKING BEHIND YOU AND BE THANKFUL THAT YOU HAVE ESCAPED SO WELL ONE MOMENT SAID THE CHOUETTE
RODOLPH YOU ARE YOU MUST BE ONE OF THOSE BENEFICENT ANGELS SENT BY THE ALMIGHTY TO DO GOOD UPON EARTH AND TO RESCUE POOR FALLEN CREATURES LIKE MYSELF FROM SHAME AND MISERY MY POOR GIRL REPLIED RODOLPH WITH A SMILE OF DEEP SADNESS AND INEFFABLE KINDNESS THOUGH STILL YOUNG I HAVE ALREADY DEEPLY SUFFERED
BY DEGREES THE DISLIKE WHICH RODOLPH AT FIRST ENTERTAINED FOR THE DOCTOR CHANGED ON THE YOUNG PRINCE'S PART INTO A COOL FAMILIARITY VERY UNLIKE THE REAL ATTACHMENT HE HAD FOR MURPHY
THESE PRETENSIONS ALARMED RODOLPH
AND HE ALSO DETECTED SO DECIDED A PHYSICAL SUPERIORITY THAT HIS HUMILIATION HAD GIVEN WAY TO A SENTIMENT OF ADMIRATION MINGLED WITH FEAR AND RESPECT
FOR SHE OFTEN SCOLDED ME FOR BEING FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS AND SAID SHE PICKED ME UP ONE DAY IN THE STREET SO SAID THE CHOURINEUR YOU HAD A DANCE INSTEAD OF A MEAL IF YOU DID NOT PICK UP TEN SOUS YES
IT IS USELESS TO SAY THAT THE YOUNG PRINCE KEPT THE MOST PERFECT SILENCE UPON THE SUBJECT OF THOSE PERNICIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD BEEN EXCITED WITHIN HIM
AND AS THEY DIED THEY LOOKED AT ONE WITH AN AIR SO GENTLE,--SO GENTLE THAT I CURSED MYSELF FOR KILLING EM
BETWEEN YOU AND ME I STRONGLY SUSPECT MLLE
RODOLPH THAT YOU ARE EVER SAD QUITE POSSIBLE MY CHILD AND TRUE
AND IT WAS UNDER PRETEXT OF INQUIRING ABOUT IT THAT THESE PARTICULARS WERE OBTAINED RIGOLETTE EXCLAIMED MURPHY AFTER HAVING BEEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY IN DEEP THOUGHT
THE TABLE AT WHICH THE SCHOOLMASTER SAT WAS CLOSE UPON THIS DARK AND DEEP HOLE AND HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON IT SO THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY CONCEALED FROM RODOLPH'S VIEW
STILL HOWEVER FOLLOWING UP THE SCENT THEY SUCCEEDED IN TRACING THE YOUTH TO HIS FRESH ABODE 17 RUE DU TEMPLE
THAT NAME WOULD MAKE ANY ONE STARE WITH ASTONISHMENT
ABOVE ALL THINGS I WOULD DESIRE THE CERTAINTY OF ITS NEVER BEING MY FATE
THE CHOUETTE ALARMED UTTERED A PIERCING SHRIEK
I DON'T WANT ANY ONE TO MAKE FREE WITH THEM MAKE YOURSELF EASY MY FINE FELLOW SAID MOTHER PONISSE
STOOPING LOW HOLDING IN HIS TEETH A LONG KNIFE WHICH GLITTERED IN THE DARKNESS VISIBLE HE DREW THE SHEEP BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND WHEN HE HAD ADJUSTED IT TOOK IT BY THE HEAD STRETCHED OUT ITS NECK AND CUT ITS THROAT
IT'S I THE CHOURINEUR SHOUTS M
BUT HE'S PROMISED TO TEACH ME AND TO AND BRAS ROUGE WHAT SORT OF A PERSON IS HE ASKED TOM
IT SEEMS BOTH FROM THE CONFESSION OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AS WELL AS FROM SEVERAL LETTERS FOUND UPON HIM THAT THE SCOUNDREL TO WHOM HE HAD ENTRUSTED HIS UNFORTUNATE OFFSPRING FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERVERTING HIS YOUNG MIND AND RENDERING HIM ONE DAY A WORTHY ASSISTANT TO HIS UNPRINCIPLED FATHER IN HIS NEFARIOUS SCHEMES PROPOSED TO THE YOUNG MAN TO JOIN IN A PLOT FOR ROBBING HIS EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS TO FORGE UPON THE FIRM TO A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT
NOTHING WAS TO BE HEARD NO SOUND DISTURBED THE DEEP SILENCE WHICH REIGNED BUT THE DROP DROP DROP THE DULL TRICKLING MONOTONOUS BUBBLING OF THE FAST-INCREASING WATERS
BUT AS YOU ARE A WORKMAN WHAT BRINGS YOU TO A TAPIS-FRANC IN THE CITE WHERE THERE ARE ONLY PRIGS CRACKSMEN OR FREED CONVICTS LIKE MYSELF AND WHO ONLY COME HERE BECAUSE WE CANNOT GO ELSEWHERE
THE ARRIVAL OF RODOLPH HAD NO DOUBT BEEN WATCHED FOR
SHE KNEW I HAD STILL A LITTLE MONEY LEFT AND THAT I COULD ASSIST HER IF I WOULD
THE GOUALEUSE HAD ANOTHER NAME GIVEN DOUBTLESS TO THE MAIDEN SWEETNESS OF HER COUNTENANCE,--SHE WAS ALSO CALLED FLEUR-DE-MARIE
BUT I DID NOT STEAL BECAUSE--BECAUSE--WHY BECAUSE THE IDEA OF STEALING NEVER CAME ACROSS ME
INDEED I AM QUITE IN EARNEST REJOINED HER COMPANION
YOU SEE TO BE DRESSED IN THIS WAY SPOILS A FELLOW
I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ONE THOUSAND BUT TWO THOUSAND FRANCS IF YOU SUCCEED FOURLINE SAID THE CHOUETTE IN A LOW TONE TO THE SCHOOLMASTER THERE'S BLUNT TO BE HAD
IT IS TO BE HOPED HE AND THE COUNTESS WILL NOT MEET
HE HAD PUT OFF WITH HIS RAGS HIS SAVAGE COARSE AND VULGAR AIR
BLESS YOU
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LAY BY SOMETHING
THEY THEN VISITED THE STABLE THE CHAISE-HOUSE THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE THE LOFTS AND THE OUT-BUILDINGS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND KEPT WITH A CLEANLINESS AND CARE WHICH BESPOKE REGULARITY AND EASY CIRCUMSTANCES
ONE OR TWO SOUS FOR BRANDY
TIS THE DEEP PITY AND COMMISERATION I FEEL FOR HIM HAS BEEN MY RUIN ADDED SHE ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY
MUCH SURPRISED AT HER EMOTION RODOLPH KINDLY INQUIRED ITS CAUSE
FOR I BESTOW IT ALL UPON YOU
THE DIRECTION WAS WRITTEN IN A FIRM BOLD HAND
IN HALF AN HOUR HE WILL LEAVE THIS HOUSE THE SCHOOLMASTER YES WITHOUT GENS-D'ARMES YES HE WILL GO OUT FROM HERE AND FREE FREE AND QUITE ALONE QUITE ALONE BUT HE WILL GO WHEREVER HE LIKES SAID RODOLPH INTERRUPTING THE CHOURINEUR WITH A MEANING SMILE
IT IS THE TIME WHEN MY BEST CUSTOMERS DROP IN
TWO LETTERS
INDEED I COULD ALMOST FANCY THAT YOU HAD BROUGHT ME OUT SOLELY FOR MY INDIVIDUAL PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT WITHOUT THINKING OF YOURSELF
COULD THIS MYSTERIOUS FEMALE IN THE BLUE FIACRE BE THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE
RODOLPH NO NO
AND ALTHOUGH IN AFTER LIFE THESE PRINCIPLES WERE VIOLENTLY SHAKEN BY THE STORM OF PASSIONS YET THEY WERE NEVER ERADICATED FROM HIS HEART
OTHERS CONVERSED TOGETHER IN WHISPERS
AGAIN THE POSSIBLE FATE OF MURPHY RECURRED TO HIM AND AS IF INSPIRED BY A FRESH HOPE HE EAGERLY FELT AROUND THE DOOR TO DISCOVER SOME SLIGHT CHINK OR OPENING BY WHICH HIS CRIES FOR HELP MIGHT BE HEARD
SHE HELD ME WITH MY HEAD BETWEEN HER KNEES WHERE SHE HELD IT AS IF IN A VICE
BUT I SEE THAT YOUR HIGHNESS HAD RECEIVED A MOST EXAGGERATED ACCOUNT
PERHAPS AS YOU KNOW HIM YOU WILL TELL US WHICH WAY HE HAS GONE I KNOW HIM BECAUSE HE GAVE ME A PRECIOUS GOOD HIDING TWO HOURS AGO TO PREVENT ME FROM BEATING GOUALEUSE AND HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE NEVER
FOURLINE BE ON YOUR GUARD CRIED THE BELDAM LEANING OVER THE OPENING OF THE TRAP
YES HE AND THE CHOUETTE TIED TOGETHER LIKE TWO ROLLS OF TOBACCO
IN THE SUMMER TO SEE HOW THE REAPERS GET ON IN THE HAY FIELD
WHAT IS THE MATTER SIR INQUIRED THE ASTONISHED PORTER
BUT WHY HAVE I A WIFE WHOSE NAME IS FINETTE THE CHOUETTE DREW UP HER HEAD
MR MURPHY SAID RODOLPH WITH A TONE OF INCREASED IRRITATION
YOU HAVE PROSTITUTED TO AN INFAMOUS WRETCH THIS HOLY RELIC,--THRICE HOLY FOR YOUR INFANT BOY HAD THIS PIOUS GIFT FROM HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER THE SCHOOLMASTER DUMFOUNDED AT THIS DISCOVERY LOWERED HIS HEAD AND MADE NO RESPONSE
MANY PERSONS MISTAKING THEIR REAL CAST OF COUNTENANCE IMAGINE SOME PECULIAR VOCATION DELINEATED IN THEIR TRAITS
HEART
SHE LIES IN THE HOPITAL BEAUJON
GOOD HEAVEN
TO SAVE THE SOUL IS THE GREAT THING TO BE LABOURED FOR AND DESIRED
SHE NEVER LET GO MY HAND BUT MADE ME WALK SO FAST--SO VERY FAST--THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO RUN TO KEEP UP WITH HER AND IN RUNNING I HAD LOST ONE OF MY WOODEN SHOES
SOONER OR LATER RODOLPH WAS SURE TO DESPISE A MAN OF THE AGE AND CHARACTER OF THE DOCTOR WHO SO UNWORTHILY LIED TO EXCUSE THE IDLENESS OF HIS PUPIL
CHAPTER XXI
YOU HAVE NO CHICKEN TO LARD NOW
BY TURNS RICH AND POOR,--NOW SUCCESSFUL AND THEN A RUINED MAN,--HE ONLY CEASED HIS SPECULATIONS WHEN NONE COULD BE FOUND TO TAKE PART IN THEM WITH HIM
AT THE END OF THIS TIME MURPHY RETURNED FROM ENGLAND AND WEPT FOR JOY ON AGAIN EMBRACING HIS YOUNG PUPIL
BUT THE COUNT D'HARNEIM IS ALSO VERY SERVICEABLE TO OUR DEAR LORD
SARAH PROMISED TO KEEP SEYTON FULLY INFORMED DAY BY DAY OF THE PROGRESS OF EVENTS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THEM
FOR BY MY HONOUR AS I SIT BESIDE YOU YOU LOOK LIKE A YOUTH OF TWENTY
A FEW DAYS PREVIOUSLY TO THIS MEETING THE ABOVE MENTIONED TOURNEMINE WHO HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER AT THE GALLEYS OF ROCHEFORT HAD SENT TO BRAS ROUGE THE REGULAR THOUGH CONCEALED CORRESPONDENT OF EVERY ROGUE AND FELON EITHER IN PRISON OR OUT OF IT A LENGTHENED DETAIL OF EVERY PARTICULAR RELATIVE TO THE CHILD FORMERLY CONFIDED TO THE WOMAN GERVAIS OTHERWISE THE CHOUETTE
WE HAVE SAID THAT ONE OF THESE FELLOWS WHO HAD ON A GREEK CAP AND CONCEALED HIS LEFT HAND WITH MUCH CARE ASKED THE OGRESS IF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND GROS-BOITEUX HAD NOT ARRIVED
NOT A WORD BEFORE THE VULGAR
GIVE YOURSELF NO UNEASINESS BUT LEAVE ALL TO ME MY LORD I CANNOT BE EASY
BUT YOU ENTERED HEAD FOREMOST AGAINST MY SKULL AND BEATING THE DRUM ON MY CARCASS
AND THE SOUNDS DIED AWAY
I BEGGED THEY WOULD GIVE ME A TRIAL AND THEY PUSHED ME INTO THE STREET AS IF I HAD BEEN A THIEF
WHY NOT GO UP-STAIRS AND FIND GOUALEUSE YOURSELF
THAT WAS A GO WASN'T IT
MEANWHILE THE COMMANDANT KEPT PACING THE ROOM WITH HIS EYES GLARING LIKE A WILD BEAST AND GLOWING LIKE TWO GLOW-WORMS BUT WERE YOU NOT AFRAID OF LOSING HIS EMPLOY HE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT HE WAS ABOUT FOR THAT
GERMAIN'S PRESENT ABODE WHY WHEN HE WAS GOING AWAY HE CAME TO US AND SAID RETURNED MADAME PIPELET I DO NOT EXPECT ANY LETTERS
ALTHOUGH SEPARATED FROM YOU I SHALL NOT LOSE SIGHT OF YOU AND NEVER FORGET THAT I AND MY BEST FRIEND OWE OUR LIVES TO YOU
NOR YESTERDAY YES HE CAME YESTERDAY WAS CALEBASSE WITH HIM,--THE DAUGHTER OF MARTIAL WHO WAS GUILLOTINED
HOWEVER I SAVED THE OLD WOMAN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE VERY SOLES OF MY FEET SCORCHED
COME COME CALM YOURSELF EXCUSE ME MY LORD
FLEUR-DE-MARIE ASKED RODOLPH IN A KIND AND AFFECTIONATE TONE WHY IS THIS
I THINK IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN US THAT YOU UNDERTAKE TO MANAGE ALL MY LITTLE DOMESTIC MATTERS FOR ME
TO BE SURE I WILL M
RECOMPENSE 212 XX
MADAME SERAPHIN STILL RESIDES WITH HIM AS MANAGER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD
A SACRED RELIC BLESSED BY THE HOLY FATHER COURAGE COURAGE
WHY MOTHER BURETTE DOES,--A MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN AT FORTUNE-TELLING
IF HE BE THE STRONGER HE HAS THE BEST OF IT
PLAIN BUT VERY COMFORTABLE THIS SMALL APARTMENT WAS FITTED UP WITH GREEN HANGINGS LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE AS HAD BEEN EXACTLY DESCRIBED TO GOUALEUSE BY RODOLPH
HOW AT THE FIRST WORD OF INTEREST EXPRESSED FOR HER,--THE FIRST MARK OF KINDNESS AND RIGHT FEELING,--THE MOST CHARMING NATURAL IMPULSES THE PUREST TASTES THE MOST REFINED THOUGHTS THE MOST POETIC IDEAS DEVELOPED THEMSELVES ABUNDANTLY IN HER INGENUOUS MIND EVEN AS IN THE EARLY SPRING A THOUSAND WILD FLOWERS LIFT UP THEIR HEADS AT THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN
HAVE YOU MADE ANY INQUIRIES RESPECTING THE MARQUIS D'HARVILLE I HAVE
HE EXTENDED HIS HAND AND TOUCHED THE STONE STAIRS DESCENDING TO THE VAULT
HIS SON'S HEALTH HAVING BEEN SO SATISFACTORILY ESTABLISHED THE GRAND DUKE TURNED HIS MOST SERIOUS ATTENTION TO THE MENTAL EDUCATION OF HIS DEARLY BELOVED SON
LISTEN WHILST I SAY A WORD TO YOU WHICH PERHAPS M
YOU HAVE PLUNDERED SO MANY UNMINDFUL OF THEIR HELPLESS DESTITUTE CONDITION,--BEGONE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A SUPPLIANT TONE LET SOME PERSON LEAD ME FORTH
PLACE OF MY BIRTH
OH BY JOVE I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE IT WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVING HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN OLD WOMAN AS BAD AS HIMSELF AND AS DEEP AS THE OLD ONE BUT SHE IS NEVER SEEN THOUGH HE HAS TOLD THE OGRESS THAT SOME DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD BRING HIS MOT WOMAN WITH HIM AND THIS WOMEN HELPS HIM IN HIS ROBBERIES YES AND IN HIS MURDERS TOO
DAVID BLUSHING TO HUMILIATE HIMSELF FURTHER SPAKE IN A FIRM TONE OF HIS SERVICES AND DISINTERESTEDNESS,--THAT HE HAD BEEN CONTENTED WITH A VERY SLENDER SALARY
BUT I AM GROWING WEAK I AM WOUNDED THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
RIGOLETTE MAY BE OF THE UTMOST SERVICE TO US
WELL AND I--I CANNOT TO-MORROW WHY NOT FOR THE REASON THAT PREVENTS YOU THIS EVENING SAID THE ROBBER IN A TONE OF MOCKERY
AND I DO NOT THINK WE SHALL FORM AN ACQUAINTANCE NOW REPLIED HE
WILL YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THE MEANING OF ALL THIS PATIENCE PATIENCE GOOD MASTER
INSTEAD OF WRITING AS A MASTER POET OR PAINTING AS A FIRST-RATE ARTIST YOU CREATE THAT WHICH THEY WOULD SCARCELY VENTURE TO DREAM OF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS TOO INDULGENT NAY BUT CANDIDLY ALL MUST AGREE THAT THE MIND WHICH COULD SO FAITHFULLY DEPICT THIS RAVISHING SCENE WITH ITS CHARM OF COLOURS AND CONTRASTS,--BEYOND US THE LOUD NOTES OF JOY AND MIRTHFUL REVELRY HERE THE SOFT SILENCE AND SWEET GENTLE MURMURS OF DISTANT VOICES THAT LULL THE SPIRIT INTO A FANCIED FLIGHT BEYOND THIS FITFUL EXISTENCE,--SURELY SURELY WITHOUT SUSPICION OF FLATTERY IT MAY BE SAID OF THE PLANNER AND CONTRIVER OF ALL THIS SUCH A ONE WAS BORN A POET AND A PAINTER COMBINED THE PRAISES OF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ARE SO MUCH THE MORE DANGEROUS FROM THE SKILL AND CLEVERNESS WITH WHICH THEY ARE UTTERED AND WHICH MAKES US LISTEN TO THEM WITH DELIGHT EVEN IN DEFIANCE OF OUR STERNEST RESOLUTIONS
THE BLEEDING HEART 157 XV
BUT SINCE THE GALLEYS MIGHT FAIL TO STOP YOUR INFAMOUS CAREER HOW IS SOCIETY TO BE PRESERVED FROM YOUR BRUTAL VIOLENCE
NOT KNOWING WHERE TO SLEEP I WAS PASSING BEFORE YOUR DOOR AND I SLEPT FOR THE NIGHT AMONGST THESE LOGS UNDER THIS HEAP NOT THINKING I HURT ANYBODY I'M NOT TO BE GAMMONED BY YOU YOU LITTLE HUSSY
WON'T YOU TAKE A DRAM O NOTHIN SHORT M
THE FEMALE WHOSE VISITS TO THE HOUSE HAD JUST BEEN DETAILED BE SHE THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE OR ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL HAD EVIDENTLY LONG STRUGGLED WITH HER IMPRUDENCE ERE SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF TO GRANT A FIRST AND SECOND RENDEZVOUS AND THEN TERRIFIED AT THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF HER IMPRUDENCE A SALUTARY REMORSE HAD IN ALL PROBABILITY PREVENTED HER FROM FULFILLING HER DANGEROUS ENGAGEMENT
WHAT A HIGH JOKE THAT YOU SHOULD COME AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT INTO THIS VERY NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MY COUNTRY-HOUSE
WHO
THE LADY WHOSE NAME WE LAST MENTIONED WORE A DRESS OF PALE AMBER WATERED SILK BENEATH A CRAPE TUNIC OF THE SAME COLOUR
GO AND CALL THE WATCH SAID THE TIMBER-MERCHANT TO HIS MAN AH THE OLD VAGABOND
NOW THEN MY LADY I'VE GOT YOU SAID THE VAGABOND AFTER GROPING ABOUT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND GRASPING IN ONE OF HIS COARSE AND POWERFUL HANDS A SLIM AND DELICATE WRIST
NO SHE IS AN ANGEL!--SO GOOD SO FIRM SO NOBLE AND UPRIGHT
I ONLY CAME TO LOOK AT THEM AND BREATHE THEIR BEAUTIFUL SMELL
THE LAST LODGER WAS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN NAMED M
TO BE HENCEFORWARD AT EVERY ONE'S MERCY,--TO FEAR THE WEAKEST THE SMALLEST OBJECT!--A CHILD MIGHT NOW MASTER ME
THE PRINCE IS SO ABSORBED WITH THE AMBASSADRESS SAID MADAME D'HARVILLE TO SARAH THAT HE PAYS NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO US YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN MY DEAR CLEMENCE REJOINED THE COUNTESS
AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE IT TO FINETTE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE GOOD FORTUNE IN THE ENTERPRISES IN WHICH SHE SO SKILFULLY SECONDS ME
RODOLPH RODOLPH TOOK HIS HAND AND SHAKING IT HEARTILY SAID
OLD BOY IT WILL PAY FOR LOOKING AFTER WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
THAT DREAM DO YOU SEE WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD OR FOOLISH
BUT AT FIRST A NIGHT DID NOT PASS BUT I SAW--LIKE A NIGHTMARE--THE SERGEANT AND SOLDIERS WHOM I HAD SLASHED AND SLAUGHTERED
NOTHING ELSE TO NOTICE
THE MARRIAGE IS INDISSOLUBLE SAID HE TO HIS ROYAL BROTHER-IN-LAW
THE ONLY THING THAT TOLD AGAINST THE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL HE BELIEVED EXISTED UNDER THE DISGUISED NAME OF THIS QUACK DENTIST WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS HAVING RED HAIR WHILE THE POLIDORI OF RODOLPH'S ACQUAINTANCE HAD ALMOST BLACK
WHY THESE TEARS AH M
REALLY SIR OR MADAM WHICH YOU PLEASE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING AS TRUE AS I DRINK THIS GLASS OF WINE
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT IS ANYTHING BUT A DREAM YOU HAVE CONJURED UP AND WHICH WILL QUICKLY PASS AWAY
HE DID NOT CONSIDER AS HIS OWN THE INSTRUCTION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED WITH HIS MASTER'S MONEY
WHILE HIS HARD BRONZED FEATURES WERE MARKED BY THE MOST PROFOUND PITY FOR THE PATIENT
LET ME FIND HER AND I'LL THROTTLE THE OLD AND DID SHE REALLY TAKE OUT YOUR TOOTH MY POOR CHILD,--THAT WRETCHED MONSTER IN WOMAN'S SHAPE DEMANDED RODOLPH WHILST THE CHOURINEUR WAS VENTING HIS RAGE IN A VOLLEY OF THE MOST VIOLENT REPROACHES
SHE AFTERWARDS DIED IN A HOSPITAL AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
AND OUT OF THIS SHE ONLY KEEPS BACK SIX FRANCS FOR HER OWN MAINTENANCE AND HANDS OVER THE OTHER TWELVE TO HER STARVING FAMILY
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE FIELD BUT THIS TRUNK OF A TREE AND FROM HERE YOU MAY SEE ALL OVER THE PLAIN
RODOLPH TOOK HER HAND
WHILST BENEATH HIS GOLD SPECTACLES THERE BEAMED AN EYE AS SHREWD AS IT WAS PENETRATING
THE LORD IS MERCIFUL AND HIS EARS ARE EVER OPEN TO SUCH AS TRULY REPENT BLIND
FAR FROM IT
WHEN THE SERVANT LEFT THE ROOM THE BRIGAND GOT UP TOOK HIS PLATE AND SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE RODOLPH AND BETWEEN HIM AND THE DOOR
THE COLONIST SAID TO HIM WITH CRUEL IRONY WELL DOCTOR HOW GOES IT
SHE WAS CHAGRINED YET SATISFIED AT THE DEPARTURE OF HER BROTHER
MASTERS DO NOT LIKE THEIR WORKMEN TO BE UNSTEADY AND GOUALEUSE GENTLY REMOVED HER ARM FROM THAT OF RODOLPH ADDING GO ON BY YOURSELF
THAT DEVIL'S DAM OF A CHOUETTE WHO SO BRUTALLY USED THIS GIRL
ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEARLY RUINED ME YET I HAD STILL SOME SMALL RESOURCES BUT THEY AT LENGTH WERE EXHAUSTED ALSO
YES
YES
YES
BRADAMANTI THE MISERY AND UTTER DESTITUTION OF POOR MOREL--BY THE WAY HE FIRST BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY COMPLAINING THAT THE RAVING AND SCREAMING OF THE OLD IDIOT WOMAN THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT FOR FOOD PREVENTED HIM FROM SLEEPING AND THAT HE FOUND IT VERY UNPLEASANT
HOW UNREASONABLE YOU ARE EXCLAIMED SARAH IN A TONE OF FRIENDLY REPROACH
BRADAMANTI BEEN AN INMATE OF THIS HOUSE ABOUT A YEAR SIR AS NEARLY AS I CAN REMEMBER,--YES IT IS A YEAR
NOW GO WITH MADAME GEORGES WHO WILL SHEW YOU THE PRETTY CHAMBER WITH ITS CLUSTERING ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLE TO FORM YOUR MORNING BOUQUETS
I AM NOT CALLED DURESNEL RODOLPH TOOK FROM THE TABLE THE CHAIN OF THE CHOUETTE AND POINTING TO THE LITTLE SAINT ESPRIT OF LAPIS LAZULI SAID IN A THREATENING VOICE
MORE DELICATE ONES MIGHT HAVE SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT THE EX-DEBARDEUR HAD A PAIR OF NATURAL SANDALS HARD AS THE HOOFS OF A HORSE
THE DEFENDER OF LA GOUALEUSE WE SHALL CALL THE UNKNOWN RODOLPH APPEARED ABOUT THIRTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE
AT LAST SHE FOUND THE DAGGER AND SPRUNG TOWARDS IT BUT AS I WAS FLAT ON MY BELLY I GAVE HER A KICK IN THE STOMACH WHICH SENT HER NECK OVER CROP
MOREOVER WE HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE PARTICULARLY RECOMMENDED TO THE REIGNING DUKE OF GEROLSTEIN BY THE OLD MARQUIS D'HARVILLE CAUGHT LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD BY SARAH WHOSE BEAUTY GRACE AND ABOVE ALL DELIGHTFUL MANNERS HE COULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE
ADDED TO WHICH ANY FEMALE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A HACKNEY-COACH FROM THAT SPOT WITHOUT NECESSARILY LIVING IN THE STREET
SINCE I CANNOT WALK CRIED HE AT LENGTH LET ME BE INSTANTLY CARRIED TO MURPHY,--THIS MOMENT MY LORD HE SLEEPS AT PRESENT
MURPHY TOLD ME THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW WHERE I LIVED M
BRAVO
THERE IS NOTHING SERIOUS TO APPREHEND
MURPHY HAD DOUBTLESS DECIPHERED THE ALMOST HIEROGLYPHIC CHARACTERS OF THE NOTE WHICH HE HAD DROPPED AND WHICH HAD ESCAPED THE VIGILANCE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER
I WILL BE ANSWERABLE TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THAT MY UNLUCKY FRIEND HERE WILL NEVER AGAIN VENTURE TO UTTER A FLATTERY SINCE SO TRUTH IS TRANSLATED IN THE NEW VOCABULARY OF GEROLSTEIN WHAT
AND THE THREE EAT BUT VERY LITTLE JUST A PENN'ORTH OF MILK A LITTLE BREAD SOME CHICKWEED BIRD-SEED AND CLEAR FRESH WATER AND THE WHOLE THREE OF THEM SING AWAY AS MERRILY AS THOUGH THEY FARED EVER SO SUMPTUOUSLY
THE BARGAIN BEING CONCLUDED THE CHILD WAS DELIVERED OVER TO THE WOMAN WITH WHOM SHE REMAINED TWO YEARS WHEN UNABLE LONGER TO ENDURE THE CRUELTY SHOWN HER THE LITTLE GIRL DISAPPEARED
BUT MAY I WITHOUT OFFENCE OBSERVE THAT ONE OF THE LETTERS IS ADDRESSED TO YOU AND THAT YOU POSSESS IN THE WRITER A CORRESPONDENT WHOSE BILLETS-DOUX ARE MARVELLOUSLY WELL PERFUMED LET US SEE WHAT IT IS ABOUT SAID THE PORTERESS TAKING THE EPISTLE IN THE SCENTED ENVELOPE
GERMAIN SAT UP WITH THE CHILDREN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT YOU HAVE A DISTRESSED FAMILY THEN HERE DISTRESSED
BUT LA
SHE CAN SCARCELY MANAGE TO KEEP HERSELF BY WORKING CLOSELY FOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY
PUT NO RESTRAINT ON YOURSELF I BESEECH YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE
SPEAK TO ME
AT LEAST HE IS CONSTANT IN HIS ATTENDANCE AT CHURCH,--HIS ATTENTION TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DUTIES CLOSE AND SEVERE THOUGH SOME ACCUSE HIM OF FOLLOWING UP THE SEVERITY OF THE LAW WITH UNNECESSARY RIGOUR
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL HE CONTINUED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
BUT TO FORCE YOU TO LIVE AMONGST GALLEY-SLAVES WHEN YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE GUILLOTINED OUT OF HAND IS INFAMOUS
ALL HE DOUBTED WAS THAT THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE SCOTCH LADY WERE AT THE SAME TIME HONOURABLE AS WELL AS AMBITIOUS
BUT I NEVER DID WRONG TO ANY ONE EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR
IT IS NOW TWO O'CLOCK
AND THEN RETREATING WITH A GESTURE OF HORROR HE CRIED IN A SUFFOCATING VOICE OH THE SERGEANT
WHAT AILS YOU CHOURINEUR HE INQUIRED
BUT IT IS GROWING LATE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS ANXIOUS THAT YOUR COURIER SHOULD START FOR GEROLSTEIN WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE IN TWO HOURS TIME HE SHALL BE ON THE ROAD
CABRION 296 THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS
THE MOST PERFIDIOUS ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE DEVISED A BETTER PLAN THAN THAT SUGGESTED BY THE WORTHY PRINCESS IN HER DESIRE TO DEFEND HER PROTEGEE
BRAS ROUGE HAVING EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS IN A LOW TONE WITH THE BRIGAND LOOKED AT RODOLPH WITH AN AIR IN WHICH CURIOSITY DISTRUST AND CONTEMPT WERE MINGLED
MY GOOD OLD MURPHY HAS HAD THE PLEASURE AND I SHOULD LIKE IT ALSO RODOLPH AND THE CHOURINEUR CAME DOWN-STAIRS
SO THEN HE SPOKE TO ALFRED AND SAYS HE COULD YOU TAKE CHARGE OF MY ROOMS AND KEEP THEM IN NICE ORDER LIGHT FIRES FROM TIME TO TIME AND GET THEM READY FOR ME WHEN I WISH TO OCCUPY THEM
THE YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NOT MAKE THE ATTEMPT TILL TEN O'CLOCK THAT'S THE VERY REASON REPLIES THE SCHOOLMASTER
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN
THE SCHOOLMASTER DRAGGING HIM TO THE ENTRANCE OF A SECOND AND STILL DEEPER CAVERN THRUST HIM INTO ITS HIDEOUS RECESSES AND CLOSING AND SECURELY BOLTING A MASSY IRON-SHOD DOOR RETURNED TO HIS WORTHY CONFEDERATE THE CHOUETTE WHO WAS WAITING TO JOIN HIM IN THE PROPOSED ROBBERY IT MIGHT BE MURDER IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES
CURSES ON HIM
THE CHOURINEUR HAD SPOKEN TRUTH WHEN HE SAID THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS FRIGHTFULLY MUTILATED
RIGOLETTE UPON HIS TINY FINGER
BUT BLESS YOU THE HOUSE WAS SO UPSET BY HIM THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HAD ANY PRICE SO HE WOULD BUT TAKE HIMSELF OFF
BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAD ANY DESIRE TO SEE ME I FORGIVE YOU SAID RODOLPH SMILING
HE IS NOT A MAN
BUT I FELT THAT KIND OF HOLY HAPPINESS WHICH I EXPERIENCE IN GOING INTO A CHURCH
WELL I THINK IF IT HAD BEEN MYSELF NOW COMING SECRETLY TO VISIT ALFRED I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TRY BACK A GREAT MANY TIMES BEFORE I COULD HAVE SCREWED UP MY COURAGE TO VENTURE IN
BUT IN TRUTH SOW TWO SMALL GRAINS OF ANYTHING IN THE SOIL AND THEY WILL PUT FORTH SHOOTS THIS COMPARISON JUST AND ALMOST POETICAL AS IT WAS STRUCK RODOLPH
SHE ENJOYS A JOKE AS WELL AS I DO AND IS QUITE AS CURIOUS AS MYSELF TO FIND OUT WHAT SORT OF PERSON SHE IS WHETHER FAIR OR DARK PRETTY OR PLAIN
THAT MAKES FOURTEEN SOUS
THE LEAST THINGS BECOME GREAT EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY
HIS BACK WAS RESTING AGAINST THE WALL AND HIS TWO HANDS WERE IN THE POCKETS OF HIS BLOUSE AND HIS LEGS STRETCHED ALONG THE BENCH
RODOLPH VERY WELL
BUT YOU ARE A DOWNRIGHT GOOD FELLOW AND HAVE NEITHER MALICE NOR HATRED IN YOUR HEART SAID THE UNHAPPY SCHOOLMASTER IN A TONE OF DEEP DEJECTION AND HUMILITY
DO NOT FOLLOW US OR ELSE THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE HURRIED OFF WHILST TOM AND THE COUNTESS WENT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOWARDS NOTRE DAME
SHE MUST BE TAKEN TO THE COMMISSARY AND MIND SHE DOES NOT ESCAPE UPON MY LIFE THIS TIMBER-MERCHANT WAS MORE OF A LOG THAN ANY LOG IN HIS OWN YARD SAID THE CHOURINEUR
WELL HE RETURNED TO FLORIDA AND TRUTH TO TELL WAS USED BY MR WILLIS WITH CONSIDERATION AND KINDNESS EATING AT HIS TABLE SLEEPING UNDER HIS ROOF
THAT BLEEDING HAS RELIEVED HIM
WHY IF YOU PLEASE MY LOR--NO SIR--HIGHNESS--RODOLPH--I HAD BETTER BEGIN BY THE BEGINNING QUITE RIGHT
QUITE BLIND REPEATED THE SCHOOLMASTER MECHANICALLY GRASPING THE POCKETBOOK
FOR I HAVE SERVED MY TIME SAID THE SAVAGE
YOU KEEP WALKING UPON GLASS AS THOUGH YOU WERE TRYING FOR IT OH BLESS YOU
ONLY WE MUST RECOLLECT WHERE WE LEAVE OFF IN OUR MORAL CATECHISM THAT WE MAY BEGIN ALL RIGHT NEXT LESSON DAY
FOR AM I NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER NOT TRUST YOU UTTERED THE MARQUISE SADLY
THE NEGRO DOCTOR WAS SEATED AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE THE CHOURINEUR ON THE OTHER
MURPHY,--NOT SEEING HER ANY MORE AT THE OGRESS'S I SUPPOSED THAT M
WHERE IS THE YOUNG MAN WHO CAME HERE THIS EVENING WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER DON'T SQUEEZE SO HARD AND I'LL TELL YOU
BUT ABOUT YOUR NEW PROTEGEE HOWEVER MY LORD
I HOPE HE HAS NOT SEEN US
HE ADVANCED ONE STEP WITH EXTENDED HANDS THEN FALLING BACK INTO THE CHAIR HE UTTERED A CRY OF UNSPEAKABLE AGONY AND RAISING HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE CEILING EXCLAIMED WITH MADDENED FURY
THE GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH IN SPITE OF HER NINETY YEARS HAD A QUICK EAR AND A SHARP EYE AND THIS LITTLE WHISPERING DID NOT ESCAPE HER
TO SEE HIM WHO HAS ALWAYS CROWED OVER ME CROWED OVER IN HIS TURN WOULD DO ME GOOD DO YOU SUPPOSE THEN THAT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I MEAN TO SPRING AT THE SCHOOLMASTER AND PIN HIM LIKE A BULL-DOG NO BUT HE'LL HAVE AT YOU IN A MOMENT WHEN HE LEARNS THAT YOU ARE A BETTER MAN THAN HE REPLIED THE CHOURINEUR RUBBING HIS HANDS
ONE IS FREE ANSWERED THE MAN
MY MAN WE HAVE CHANGED OUR MINDS
THE ONE-EYED WOMAN RESUMED FLEUR-DE-MARIE MADE ME SELL BARLEY-SUGAR IN THE EVENINGS ON THE PONT NEUF
WHAT THINK YOU OF THIS HOTEL YOUNG FELLOW INQUIRED THE SCHOOLMASTER
AS I APPROACHED THE WINDOWS STILL SEARCHING FOR MY DARLING COCOTTE I SAW IN ONE OF THE CHAMBERS DOOR ON THE LEFT SOME BAGS OF CROWN PIECES IN A BUREAU
SHE HAD SCARCELY ENTERED MY ROOM WHEN SEEING THE CRUCIFIX SHE FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE IT
HOW I WILL TELL YOU
RIGOLETTE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE ADDRESS OF GERMAIN THE SCHOOLMASTER'S SON
MON DIEU M
AND AS THE ALLEE DES VEUVES IS DESERTED AT AN EARLY HOUR WE WILL WALK THAT WAY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK I WILL JOIN YOU AT NINE O'CLOCK DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT WISH THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS JOB TOGETHER I DO WISH IT WELL THEN WE DO NOT SEPARATE BEFORE EVENING OR ELSE OR ELSE I SHALL THINK THAT YOU ARE MAKING A PLANT FOR ME AND THAT'S THE REASON YOU WISH TO PART COMPANY NOW IF I WISHED TO SET THE TRAPS AFTER YOU WHAT IS TO PREVENT MY DOING SO THIS EVENING WHY EVERYTHING
AFTER WHICH THE KEY IS TO BE TAKEN DOWN-STAIRS AGAIN AND KEPT TILL MY ARRIVAL SPITE OF THE WANT OF FINISHED COMPOSITION DISPLAYED IN THIS BILLET RODOLPH PERFECTLY COMPREHENDED TO WHOM AND WHAT IT ALLUDED AND MERELY ADDED AFTER PERUSING IT
THE CHOURINEUR TOLD EM ALL ABOUT HIM AND AS HOW AS YOU WELL WELL THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW YOU WANT YOUR CHANGE YES AND I WANT TO TAKE GOUALEUSE TO PASS THE DAY IN THE COUNTRY OH THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE WHY WHY
IF THOU DOST NOT COME I'LL POKE YOUR EYE OUT AND MAKE YOU A MATCH FOR THE CHOUETTE
SOME TIME HENCE WHEN SHE SHALL BE BETTER AND MORE AT EASE WE WILL TALK ABOUT HER FUTURE LIFE
THEN TO THE RUE SAINT ELOI
THE OGRESS 19 III
BUT THE AIR OF THE CITE IS BAD AND IT BEGAN TO WITHER IN TWO DAYS
AND I FEEL MORE FLATTERED THAN IF ANY ONE TOLD ME I WAS A BETTER MAN THAN EITHER THE SKELETON OR THE SCHOOLMASTER
ALL MY FEAR WAS THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO PARIS
AND IT SHALL BE CASH IN FULL REPLIED THE UNKNOWN
RODOLPH'S,--BODY AND BONES OF ME!--WHEN HE COMES TO KNOW THAT--BUT THEN LUCKILY SILENCE
CABRION IT IS
I FOUND YOU THERE IN A CAB AND HERE WE ARE WELL DO YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REGRET IN ALL THIS WHY I'LL TELL YOU M
MUST BE SOMETHING SHARPER THAN GLASS COULD HURT THEM A TEASPOON SAID THE DOCTOR
OH PRAY BE ON YOUR GUARD M
THERE SHE IS SAYS I TO ALFRED
I WOULD RATHER BE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE WRETCHED THAN I HAVE YET BEEN THAN BECOME A BUTCHER YET REFLECT A LITTLE WHY MY LORD WHEN I HEARD THE CRY OF THE POOR ANIMAL WHICH COULD NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST RESISTANCE
BEFORE HE LEFT THE TAPIS-FRANC THE HEAD OFFICER LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT THE OTHER GUESTS ASSEMBLED AND SAID TO THE CHOURINEUR IN A TONE ALMOST KIND
IT WAS ADDING ABSURDITY TO CRUELTY FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO
A PERSON WHO HAS A LARGE TRACT OF PROPERTY AT ALGIERS WILL GIVE ME UP FOR YOU ONE OF THE EXTENSIVE FARMS HE HOLDS IN THAT COUNTRY
BUT PITY RESPECT FOR YOUR WIFE AND SON THEY SHALL SAVE YOU FROM THE SHAME OF A SCAFFOLD
AS THE LAST LIGATURE GAVE WAY HE SPRANG UP HIS HIDEOUS COUNTENANCE EXPRESSING RAGE HORROR AND ALARM
A LARGE HANDKERCHIEF OF WHITE MUSLIN CROSSED HER BOSOM AND DISAPPEARED UNDER THE HIGH FOLD OF A SMALL SHOT TAFFETAS APRON WHOSE BLUE AND RED SHADES APPEARED TO ADVANTAGE OVER A DARK NUN'S DRESS WHICH SEEMED EXPRESSLY MADE FOR HER
YET THERE IS HOPE OH MURPHY
MURPHY OF ME WHILST DOING ALL IN HIS POWER TO AID ME WORTHY KIND-HEARTED CREATURE MURMURED RODOLPH IN A TONE OF DEEP DISTRESS
HE SET OUT WITH MUCH REGRET AND IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS SISTER
HER GRACEFUL NECK OF DAZZLING WHITENESS WAS ENCIRCLED BY A SMALL NECKLACE OF GRAINS OF CORAL
AGREED THEN
HE LIED MURPHY NEVER LIES SAID RODOLPH CALMLY
BUT HE WAS FINELY VEXED,--READY TO HANG HIMSELF I COULD SEE HE WAS,--AND IT WAS RARE NUTS TO ME
ALTHOUGH AT ROCHEFORT AND PREPARING FOR MY ESCAPE I ARRANGED THIS PLAN AND CORRESPONDED IN CIPHER WITH MY FRIEND OH MON DIEU HIS CHILD
WE HAVE SAID THAT RODOLPH ACCOMPANIED BY MURPHY HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM THE COURT ON A JOURNEY FOR SOME WEEKS
NOW AMBITION BEING SARAH'S RULING PASSION AND HER NOBLE AND ARISTOCRATICAL FEATURES WELL ASSISTING THE DELUSION SHE SMILED AS THE WORD DIADEM CROSSED HER THOUGHTS AND LENT A WILLING EAR TO THE PREDICTIONS OF HER HIGHLAND NURSE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED HERSELF PREDESTINED TO A SOVEREIGN DESTINY
PIPELET THE PORTER TEMPORARILY ABSENT HAD LEFT HIS BETTER HALF MADAME PIPELET AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE
IT'S FALSE
I WILL SEE YOU ALL RIGHT BEFORE I LEAVE YOU ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU DO NOT MEAN ME SOME HARM
RIGOLETTE IS KIND AND CHARITABLE TOO AS FAR AS LIES IN HER POWER
HARDLY VENTURING TO BREATHE LEST THE HEAVING OF HIS HUGE CHEST SHOULD DISTURB THE INVALID HE AWAITED WITH THE MOST INTENSE ANXIETY THE RESULT OF THE DOCTOR'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE SICK MAN'S STATE
I THINK I SEE HER THE OLD NIGHT-BIRD SHOUTED THE CHOURINEUR LAUGHING
THEN--BUT YOU'LL LAUGH AT ME M
YOUR EAGER CRAVING AFTER A WRETCHED EXISTENCE WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM SUFFERING THE AGONY OF ANTICIPATED DEATH AND FAR FROM DWELLING UPON THE SCAFFOLD AND THE BLOCK YOUR GUILTY SOUL WOULD BE FILLED WITH SCHEMES OF ESCAPE AND HOPES OF PARDON
SARAH WAS OF A NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE AND SUCH A UNION WAS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT
ILLUSTRATION

ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
MY HOUSE AND MY SHOP ARE SONGS TO THE SAME TUNE
A FEW WORDS WILL DESCRIBE THE OGRESS AND HER GUESTS
THE LAND YIELDS THREE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
AND HE IS BESIDES ONLY THIRTY-EIGHT STRONG AS A BULL WITH AN IRON CONSTITUTION AND VERY FOND OF HIS BUSINESS
THE EVENING BEFORE AT TEN O'CLOCK THE CHOURINEUR WAS PUNCTUAL TO THE APPOINTMENT WHICH RODOLPH HAD FIXED WITH HIM
I HAVE ORDERED OUR BREAKFAST RODOLPH WISHED THE BRIGAND TO PASS IN FIRST FOR CERTAIN REASONS
THAT WOULD INDEED BE TO REALISE OUR CASTLES IN THE AIR DEAR FLEUR-DE-MARIE YOUR WISHES ARE REALISED,--YOUR DREAM A TRUE ONE NO NO YOU MUST BE JESTING
YOUR TAPIS-FRANC IS A REGULAR MOUSE-TRAP
HERE COMES THAT TIRESOME FRIEND OF MY HUSBAND'S THE DUKE DE LUCENAY
BUT I STILL STICK TO WHAT I SAY AND OH
HERE IS A DEPOSIT TO COMPLETE THE BARGAIN
BUT WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND MY VOICE BEGAN TO GET ROUGH IT BECAME A PASSION--A TASTE--A RELISH--A RAGE--WITH ME TO CUT AND SLASH
AT SIXTEEN TO BE THROWN ON THE CITY OF PARIS AS I WAS ONE IS SO LONELY
BUT ONCE MORE BELIEVE IF I WERE TO BELIEVE YOU THEN YOU WOULD SAY POOR CHOURINEUR
YOUR FAMILY MY RELATIONS
YOU WILL ALLOW WON'T YOU THAT SHE HAD MERITED IT BY HER EXCELLENT QUALITIES HER MISFORTUNES EVEN IF SHE DID NOT BELONG TO THE FAMILY OF HARVILLE,--A FAMILY TO WHICH MY FATHER HAD VOWED ETERNAL GRATITUDE I HAVE ALWAYS APPROVED OF THE SENTIMENTS WHICH YOUR LORDSHIP HAS ENTERTAINED FOR MADAME GEORGES BUT YOU ARE ASTONISHED AT THE INTEREST I TAKE IN THIS POOR GIRL ARE YOU NOT PRAY PRAY MY LORD I WAS WRONG
LET US SIT DOWN HERE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THEY SAY TOO THAT SHE IS YET SO LOVELY CHARMING!--TOO CHARMING
HE IS CALLED THE SCHOOLMASTER BECAUSE HE WROTE A SPLENDID HAND AND HAS HAD A GOOD EDUCATION AND IS HE MUCH FEARED HE WILL NOT BE ANY LONGER WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM SUCH A LICKING AS YOU GAVE ME
DESIROUS OF REMEDYING SO EXTREME AN INCONVENIENCE IN A COUNTRY SUBJECT TO VIOLENT EPIDEMICS AND TO HAVE AT HAND AT ALL TIMES A SKILFUL PRACTITIONER THE COLONIST MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND DAVID TO FRANCE TO LEARN SURGERY AND MEDICINE
WELL THEN THIS EVENING BE IT
DE GRAUEN GAILY AND MAKING WITH MOCK RESPECT A LOW AND RESPECTFUL BOW TO THE WORTHY SQUIRE
BUT I HADN'T A SOUL ON EARTH TO ADVISE ME
I LIKE TO BE MY OWN MISTRESS
AFTER HAVING VENTED MUCH RAILLERY ON THE COARSENESS OF THE EARLY OCCUPATIONS OF HIS YOUNG PUPIL THE DOCTOR LAYING ASIDE HIS THIN MASK OF AUSTERITY HAD GREATLY AROUSED THE CURIOSITY AND HEATED THE FANCY OF THE YOUNG PRINCE BY THE EXAGGERATED DESCRIPTIONS STRONGLY DRAWN AND DEEPLY COLOURED OF THE PLEASURES AND GALLANTRIES WHICH HAD ILLUSTRATED THE REIGNS OF LOUIS XIV THE REGENT AND ESPECIALLY LOUIS XV THE HERO OF CESAR POLIDORI
ONLY IT IS BETTER TO COME TO A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING BEFOREHAND
THE POOR FELLOW SEEMED ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HIS WHOLE WEIGHT SO THAT NO PORTION OF IT SHOULD TOUCH THE FLOOR
THERE'S SOMETHING IN ALL THIS,--DECIDEDLY THERE IS SOMETHING BUT AGAIN I ASK YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ALL IN GOOD TIME I'LL TELL YOU
THE GOOD WOMAN WHO OWNS THIS FARM WAS MY NURSE AND BROUGHT ME UP HERE
THEY ARE ONLY TWO LITTLE WORDS AND YET THOSE TWO WORDS HAD THAT EFFECT
BUT IF ALL YOU TELL ME IS AS YOU SAY I THINK IT WOULD BE THE THING TO DO IT AT ONCE THIS EVENING AND THE RUFFIAN LOOKED EARNESTLY AT RODOLPH
I SAY MOTHER PONISSE I SHALL SOON BE BACK AGAIN
QUITE CORRECT
I WOULD RATHER THAT SHE STILL BELIEVED HERSELF IN MY CLUTCH WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND DO AS I BID YOU OH WHAT A CROSS CREETUR YOU ARE
THERE WERE AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THEM WHERE IS TORTILLARD SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
TO MAKE SURE I WENT TO PIERREFITTE WHERE HIS COUNTRY-HOUSE IS SITUATED AND THERE I LEARNED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE BACK AGAIN UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW WELL BUT TO RETURN TO MY QUESTION
I DID NOT LIKE A POKE HE GAVE ME AND I KICKED AT HIM
AND IF I DARED TO ASK THE CHOUETTE FOR SOMETHING TO EAT SHE BEAT ME AND SAID GET TEN SOUS AND THEN YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR SUPPER THEN I BEING VERY HUNGRY AND AS SHE HURT ME VERY MUCH CRIED WITH A VERY FULL HEART AND SORE BODY
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL
PIPELET ANXIOUSLY ADDED PROVIDING SIR YOU ARE NOT A PAINTER NO I AM NOT A PAINTER BUT A PLAIN MERCHANT'S CLERK MY MOST HUMBLE DUTY TO YOU SIR
THAT SORT OF WORK IS SO MUCH IMITATED AND SO CHEAPLY GOT UP THAT--FOR A MAN CAN BUT WORK HIS BEST AND HE CANNOT DO MORE THAN HE CAN
SHE FELL SICK AND NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK APPLIED FOR ADMITTANCE TO A LYING-IN HOSPITAL BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM
AND THEN TIRED AND EXHAUSTED SAT DOWN TO LISTEN
WELL IT SEEMS THAT GOUBIN'S WIFE COULD NOT BEAR IT AND SO GOING OUT AT ALL RISKS EVEN OF BEING KILLED BY HER HUSBAND WHO WAS LOOKING FOR HER EVERYWHERE SHE LEFT THE CELLAR IN OPEN DAY AND CAME TO ME
BUT I HOPE THAT THIS DESPATCH ANNULS THE LAST ORDERS ISSUED BY MONSEIGNEUR WITH REGARD TO THIS WRETCHED CREATURE ON THE CONTRARY BARON MY LORD THEN DESIRES THAT HER ESCAPE FROM THE FORTRESS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SHUT UP FOR LIFE MAY BE EFFECTED YES AND THAT HER PRETENDED RAVISHER SHOULD BRING HER TO FRANCE,--TO PARIS YES
DE GRAUEN TAKING HIS HAT UP IN HASTE
THINK OF THAT
WHY ALFRED MIGHT AS WELL CALL HIMSELF PORTER TO A PRINCE HOW SO WHY HE IS ONLY IN THE NATIONAL GUARD
AFTERWARDS A DEEP AND MUTUAL LOVE REPAID HIM THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE
HE SELLS EVERYTHING HE IS FORBIDDEN TO SELL AND DOES EVERYTHING WHICH IT IS FORBIDDEN TO DO
RIGOLETTE ON THE CONTRARY PREFERS PARIS AND LIKES TO WALK ON THE BOULEVARDS
ARE YOU A-GOING TO COME MY LORD AND PAY IT FOR HER YES SAID RODOLPH THROWING FIVE LOUIS ON THE OGRESS'S BAR AND WHAT'S YOUR PRICE FOR THE CLOTHES SHE WEARS THE OLD HAG AMAZED LOOKED AT THE LOUIS ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH AN AIR OF MUCH DOUBT AND MISTRUST
YES MY LAD
YES UPON MY WORD IT IS SCENTED UP LIKE A REAL BILLET-DOUX
FROM THE HOUR I WENT TO LIVE WITH THE OGRESS SAID SHE IN A LOW TONE WHILE DEEP BLUSHES DYED HER CHEEK I NEVER ONCE ENTERED A CHURCH,--I DURST NOT
ANOTHER PATTERN LODGER ALWAYS PAYS HER RENT IN ADVANCE AND KEEPS HER LITTLE CHAMBER SO NICE AND CLEAN
OH HOW I LOVE THE COUNTRY WITH A LOVER BY YOUR SIDE MY GIRL ASKED THE CHOURINEUR
DAVID TALKED OF HIS LOVE,--LOVE SO LONG AND TENDERLY SHARED AND THE PLANTER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
BUT YOUR ESCAPE AND YOUR FRESH CRIMES FORBID ANY SUCH COURSE ON MY PART NOW AND PLACE YOU BEYOND ALL LAW
THE MASTER'S PREFERENCE SOON COMMANDS THE PREFERENCE OF THOSE BELOW HIM
I REACHED HIS DOOR WHICH I FOUND HALF SHUT
THIS EXCELLENT PEOPLE ENJOYED SO MUCH REAL FELICITY AND WERE SO PERFECTLY CONTENTED WITH THEIR CONDITION THAT THE ENLIGHTENED CARE OF THE GRAND DUKE WAS NOT MUCH CALLED INTO ACTION TO PRESERVE THEM FROM THE MANIA OF CONSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS
IT IS STILL THERE FIXED IMMOVABLE
SAY THAT THIS RETURN OF M
HE IS NEITHER THE SCHOOLMASTER NOR MASTER RODOLPH
FIND EM LAD THE DOG RAN TO ME AND FOR FEAR OF BEING BITTEN I BEGAN TO CRY OUT WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND MAIN
A MASS OF REDDISH HAIR STRONGLY MIXED WITH GRAY AND A LONG BEARD OF THE SAME HUE COMPLETED THE HIDEOUS ENSEMBLE
THIS CHEF-D'OEUVRE AS THE ANCIENT MASTERS OF THE CRAFT WOULD STYLE THEM JOINED TO THE FANTASTIC DESIGNS SKETCHED ON THE WALLS REPRESENTING BOOTS AND SHOES ABUNDANTLY INDICATED THAT THE PORTER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT DEVOTED HIS TIME AND HIS TALENTS TO THE REPAIRING OF SHOES AND SHOE LEATHER
BUT LET THE BRAVE FELLOW TO WHOM ALL PRAISE IS DUE RELATE THE AFFAIR IN WHICH HE WAS THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR HIMSELF WHERE IS HE
BY DEGREES YOU BEGIN TO REMARK ONE MORE THAN THE OTHERS
TWO OR THREE MORE LESSONS LIKE THAT AND I SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT RESTORED TO HIMSELF AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE SCHOOLMASTER DARTED OFF IN PURSUIT OF RODOLPH BUT HE HAD DISAPPEARED WITH THE CHARCOAL-MAN IN THE DARK LABYRINTH OF THE STREETS OF THE CITE AND THE BRIGAND FOUND IT USELESS TO FOLLOW
IT IS A TAPIS-FRANC WITH ALL MY HEART
OLD MURPHY TOO
WELL MY LAD OF WAX WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU SAID THE OGRESS TO RODOLPH WHOSE GOOD-WILL SHE WAS DESIROUS TO CONCILIATE AND WHOSE SUPPORT SHE MIGHT PERCHANCE REQUIRE
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED MY GIRL SAID THE CHOURINEUR WHEN HE SAW HER EXTREME FEAR AND THAT SHE HAD SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM HER COMPANION
FOR HE EXCLAIMED DIEU DE DIEU WHAT A DISH
A FLIGHT OF STEPS CUT OUT OF THE DAMP AND GREASY GROUND LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS SORT OF DEEP DITCH AGAINST ONE END OF WHICH CUT PERPENDICULARLY LEANED A LOW MEAN DILAPIDATED HOVEL
I SAID TO HER YOU MUST BE VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW WHO YOUR MYSTERIOUS BENEFACTOR IS KNOW HIM SHE REPLIED WITH DELIGHTFUL SIMPLICITY
THE MISERABLE VILLAIN STARTED
SO THE SELF-IMAGINED CONSPIRATOR WASTES DAYS AND HOURS IN PONDERING OVER MIGHTY DEEDS HE FEELS CALLED UPON TO DO
HE ENDEAVOURED TO EXAMINE THE FEATURES OF LA GOUALEUSE
ADDING HOWEVER WITH AN INDIFFERENT AIR I DO NOT KNOW BRAS ROUGE
WE HAD APPOINTED TO MEET A FRIEND IN A CABARET IN THIS STREET AND HAVE PERHAPS MISTAKEN THE HOUSE IN COMING HERE THIS IS THE WHITE RABBIT AT YOUR SERVICE SIR THAT'S RIGHT ENOUGH THEN SAID THOMAS MAKING A SIGN TO SARAH
COME TELL US ALL ABOUT IT FINETTE I WENT STRAIGHT TO NO
I HAVE CONFIDED HIM TO ONE OF MY ACCOMPLICES WHO WHEN I WAS APPREHENDED EFFECTED HIS ESCAPE WHAT DID HE DO WITH HIM HE BROUGHT HIM UP AND GAVE HIM AN EDUCATION WHICH FITTED HIM TO ENTER INTO A BANKING-HOUSE AT NANTES SO THAT WE MIGHT GET INFORMATION MANAGE AN INTRODUCTION TO THE BANKER AND SO FACILITATE OUR PLANS
IN THE ARMY IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING
LISTEN TO ME
IT BELONGED TO A MADAME HERBELOT THE WIDOW OF A FACTOR LIVING CLOSE BY AND IT WAS ALSO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT MADAME HERBELOT VALUED THE PARROT AS MUCH AS SHE DID HER LIFE
TAKE CARE OR HE WILL HAVE HIS REVENGE ON YOU DON'T BE FRIGHTENED MY CHILD
BUT HE HAS DONE ME MUCH HARM
THE RICH COLOURING OF AN OCTOBER SUN GILDED THE CHARMING LANDSCAPE WHILE THE VARIEGATED TINT OF THE CHESTNUT-LEAVES SLIGHTLY TINGED BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZES STOOD OUT IN BOLD RELIEF AGAINST THE CLEAR BLUE OF THE SURROUNDING SKY
GENEALOGY OF THE SOVEREIGNS OF EUROPE AND THEIR FAMILIES
TEN O'CLOCK STRUCK BY THE DISTANT DIAL OF THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE
WHY M
FOR I ONLY TOLD HIM HALF MY PLAN YOU MUST KNOW NOT KNOWING IF HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT WAS VERY PROPER THE MORE SO AS I HAD TWO STRINGS TO MY BOW YOU ARE A CAREFUL MAN
THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED
A SMILE CAME TO MY LIPS AND A TEAR IN MY EYE WHEN IN HER GENTLE AND SENSIBLE PRATTLE SHE URGED ON ME THE NECESSITY OF SAVING FORTY SOUS A DAY THAT I MIGHT BE BEYOND WANT OR EVIL TEMPTATIONS
HE WAS A GOOD JUDGE OF HORSES WAS ORDERLY AND FIRM IN HIS CONDUCT AND ARRANGEMENTS AND SO IN A SHORT TIME COMPLETELY REMODELLED THE STABLES OF THE GRAND DUKE WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD BEEN NEGLECTED AND BECOME DISORGANISED
IT WAS AS DARK AS THE MOUTH OF AN OVEN AND I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH ANYTHING SO I CUT A NOTCH IN A TREE THAT I MIGHT FIND OUT THE PLACE IN THE MORNING WELL THOUGHT OF MY GOOD FELLOW THIS MORNING I WENT THERE AND ABOUT TEN YARDS FROM THE TREE I SAW A NARROW ENTRANCE CLOSED BY A GATE
HIS EXCELLENCY M
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES
MURPHY YOU ARE JESTING WITH ME BUT WHY THE DEVIL DID YOU NOT COME BACK AGAIN TO THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AFTER THAT FATAL NIGHT
THEN IN STRANGE CONTRAST A HOLY BRANCH OF BOXWOOD BOUGHT AT CHURCH BY THE OGRESS WAS SUSPENDED AT THE BACK OF AN OLD CUCKOO CLOCK
THE PUNISHMENT
THEN RISE AND TAKE A WALK AROUND THE FARM
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT BUT THEN THEN THEY PAID FOR MY LIQUOR AND WANTED TO DRAW ME ABOUT YOU
YOU SHALL WALK INTO THESE TWO MUFFS ALL THE SAME PRESENTLY THE SCHOOLMASTER LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT
MY LORD I WAS WRONG TO BE SO SENSITIVE
YOU WILL HAVE IN MADAME GEORGES A CONSTANT EXAMPLE IN ME A CAREFUL ADVISER
AT LENGTH I FELL ASLEEP
THE DOCTOR WAS LOST IN MEDITATION
OH DEAR
DON'T YOU THINK SO ALFRED THE FACT IS SAID THE PORTER IN A SEVERE TONE THAT I KNOW NO HARM OF MLLE
AND I SHOULD HELP HER TO WORK TO ATTEND TO THE FAMILY LINEN TO KEEP EVERYTHING NEAT AND CLEAN TO STORE UP THE SUMMER FRUITS AGAINST WINTER--OH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO COMPLAIN THAT I WAS IDLE I PROMISE
OH HE HAS A WELL-FURNISHED HOUSE
I LOOKED FOR HIM BUT ONLY FOUND MY BLOUSE,--HE HAD GNAWED HIS WAY OUT WITH HIS TEETH
HE PREFERRED REMAINING AT HOME HE SEEMS TO ME TO MIX LESS AND LESS IN THE WORLD HE NEVER LIKED WHAT IS CALLED FASHIONABLE GAIETY THE MARQUISE'S AGITATION VISIBLY INCREASED
UNBIND HIM AND REMOVE THE GAG EXCLAIMED DAVID
AND A MORE BEAUTIFUL SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT NEVER CHARMED THE EYE THAN THAT PRESENTED BY THE ASPECT OF THE WINTER GARDEN TO WHICH RODOLPH HAD CONDUCTED HIS NOBLE HOSTESS
I LIKE YOU AM WITHOUT FRIENDS OR PARENTS
POOR OLD DARLING
NOW SUPPOSE YOU HAD SIX DECAYED TEETH,--AND HE SAYS THE SAME THING TO ALL WHO CHOOSE TO LISTEN TO HIM,--WELL THEN HE WILL TAKE OUT FIVE FOR NOTHING AND ONLY CHARGE YOU FOR THE SIXTH
HIS COUNTENANCE CONTRACTED BY ANGER NOW EXPANDED
IT MAKES ME MORE FEARFUL STILL AT THIS MOMENT DAVID ISSUED FROM THE CABINET
CHARLES LET HER BE SHOWN UP TO THE APARTMENT
HE LOOKS SOMEWHAT SHAMEFACED COME FORWARD MY BRAVE FELLOW SAID RODOLPH EXTENDING HIS HAND TO HIS PRESERVER
I DO NOT SEE ANY HOUSE HERE CERTAINLY NOT IF YOU LOOK ROUND ABOUT YOU WHERE SHOULD I LOOK THEN AT YOUR FEET AT MY FEET YES AND WHEREABOUTS HERE,--LOOK
RODOLPH I WAS DESIROUS OF TRYING YOU STILL FURTHER
HE PUSHED ME AGAIN I RETURNED HIS POKE
HER LARGE BLUE EYES SPARKLED BRIGHTLY HER VERMILION LIPS PARTLY OPENED TO RECOVER HER BREATH DISPLAYED TWO ROWS OF LIQUID PEARLS
AH M
AH M
AH M
NOT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR PASSION THAT I UTTERED THOSE WORDS
NOW KEEP YOUR PROMISE
I FISHED YOU OUT AND BROUGHT YOU HERE ON MY BACK AS THERE WAS NOBODY AT HAND TO GET A COACH
REDUCED TO LIVE FROM DAY TO DAY BY EXPEDIENTS MORE OR LESS ILLEGAL HE BECAME A CURIOUS SPECIMEN OF THE FIGARO SCHOOL,--SO LONG AS HIS INTEREST WAS CONCERNED HE WOULD DEVOTE HIMSELF SOUL AND BODY TO HIS EMPLOYER
AT EVERY INSTANT IT WOULD RENEW THOSE DREAMS WHICH I WAS BEGINNING TO FORGET
FORBEAR I BEG AND WHY MY LORD CAN YOU NOT LISTEN TO ME NOW AS WELL AS ANY OTHER TIME BECAUSE YOU ARE INTERFERING WITH ONE OF MY SHORT-LIVED MOMENTS OF PRIDE AND HAPPINESS
SIR YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
RODOLPH SAY IT I DO NOT THINK YOU ARE THE MAN TO LAY A TRAP AND SET THE POLICE ON THE SCHOOLMASTER
THIS YOUTHFUL RAKE THE EMBLEM OF PRECOCIOUS VICE WAS SMOKING A SHORT BLACK PIPE
AND I OUGHT SO TO HAVE INTERPRETED THE INTEREST YOU EVINCE FOR YOUR PROTEGEE
NEITHER WILL I DELIVER YOU INTO THE HANDS OF THE LAW DO YOU THEN PARDON ME EXCLAIMED THE SCHOOLMASTER AS THOUGH DOUBTING WHAT HE HEARD
TO POSSESS A SPLENDID HOTEL AND TO MIX IN THE FIRST CIRCLES OF FASHION
ARE WE NOT MY LORD YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IN DEIGNING TO CONTINUE TO ME SO FLATTERING A PLACE IN YOUR RECOLLECTION MAKES IT STILL MORE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME EVER TO FORGET YOUR MANY ACTS OF CONDESCENDING KINDNESS I ASSURE YOU M
AND HOW HIGH THEY FLY
WHO WILL HAVE IT
AMONGST THE HANDSOMEST OF THE FEMALE SLAVES AT THE HOUSE WAS A METISSE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED CECILY AND FOR THIS POOR GIRL MR WILLIS TOOK A FANCY
THEN WE WILL GO AND INTRODUCE OURSELVES TO YOUR PETS THE PIGEONS AFTERWARDS VISIT THE DAIRY AND SO GO ON TILL WE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE FARM
THUS AFTER SIX MONTHS RESIDENCE IN PARIS SARAH WAS IN A CONDITION TO CONTEST WITH THE MOST PARISIAN OF PARISIAN WOMEN AS TO THE PIQUANT FINISH OF HER WIT THE CHARM OF HER LIVELINESS THE INGENUOUSNESS OF HER FLIRTATION AND THE EXCITING SIMPLICITY OF HER LOOKS AT ONCE CHASTE AND PASSIONATE
THE GOUALEUSE WHO HAD SOUGHT REFUGE IN THIS ALLEY AND LIGHTLY ASCENDED A FEW STEPS PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND SAID TO HER UNKNOWN DEFENDER THANKS SIR FOR HAVING TAKEN MY PART
WHY DO YOU MENTION HER NAME ALAS
I COULD NOT FOR THE WORLD
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MR WILLIS SITUATED ON THE BORDERS OF THE SEA WAS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY LEAGUES FROM THE NEAREST TOWN
AS TO THE ERRAND ON WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS EMPLOYED EACH OF THEM AS AN OSTENSIBLE MOTIVE FOR GETTING RID OF THEM IN A QUIET WAY,--SENDING ONE TO AVIGNON AND THE OTHER TO STRASBOURG,--I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SOME DAY WHEN WE ARE BOTH IN A DULL MOOD
BUT MIND YOU ARE ONLY TO CALL ME M
POOR CHILD
AND THIS HOPE COMFORTED ME
HIS HEAD WHICH WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE WAS BURIED BETWEEN TWO SHOULDERS BROAD POWERFUL AND FLESHY DISPLAYING THEMSELVES EVEN UNDER THE LOOSE FOLDS OF HIS COARSE COTTON BLOUSE
ALFRED THINKS HIM AS INNOCENT AS A LAMB EVER SINCE HE CURED HIS RHEUMATICS M
I WAS THEN SENT ON TO THE BRIDGE WITH MY BARLEY-SUGAR
HOWEVER THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE NOT SO BLIND AS TO BELIEVE IMPLICITLY IN THIS HIGHLAND PROPHECY AND TO LOOK ABSOLUTELY FOR A THRONE OF THE FIRST RANK IN A SPLENDID DISDAIN OF SECONDARY ROYALTIES OR REIGNING PRINCIPALITIES
I HAVE HAD NOTHING TO EAT FOR TWO DAYS AND I'VE RUN AWAY FROM THE CHOUETTE WHO PULLED OUT MY TOOTH AND SAID SHE WOULD THROW ME OVER TO THE FISHES
LET THE CHOUETTE TELL HER TALE YOUNG MAN
I DO NOT SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE NUISANCE IT IS TO A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE TO BLACKEN HIS FACE WITH CHARCOAL AND MAKE HIMSELF LOOK LIKE A DEVIL
IN ONE WAS A BAR AND A BROKEN-DOWN BILLIARD-TABLE
THERE WAS AN OLD HOUSE IN RUINS CLOSE AT HAND AND I SAID TO MYSELF IF THIS SHOWER IS TO LAST ALL NIGHT I SHALL SLEEP AS WELL HERE AS IN MY OWN CRIB SO I ROLLED MYSELF INTO A SORT OF CAVE WHERE I WAS HIGH AND DRY
BUT COME ON ONE MOMENT,--I WISH TO KNOW IF THE LANDLORD IS IN
WHY YOU HEATHEN WOULD YOU HAVE US LIVE LIKE DOGS REPLIED THE OGRESS
RODOLPH DO YOU SEE SIR FOUR FRANCS A DAY ARE ALWAYS FOUR FRANCS A DAY
I VERILY BELIEVE MOTHER BURETTE HAS DEALINGS WITH THE OLD ONE AND PRACTISES MAGIC IN THIS PRIVATE APARTMENT
HOW SORRY I AM THAT I THREATENED TO BEAT YOU JUST NOW AND FRIGHTENED YOU
RODOLPH PAUSED TILL THE SOUNDS HAD DIED AWAY AND THEN DESCENDED THE STAIRS
BUT YOU ARE CHOOSING A VERY ILL HOUR FOR YOUR LECTURES
SARAH PARTICIPATED IN THE PRINCE'S AFFECTION BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO DISHONOUR SHE COULD ONLY BE THE WIFE OF HIS HIGHNESS
AND THIRDLY TWO BOXES THE ONE COMPOSED OF VARIEGATED STRAW THE OTHER COVERED WITH MULTITUDINOUS SHELLS BUT BOTH SMELLING STRONGLY OF THE GALLEYS OR HOUSE OF CORRECTION[10 LET US HOPE FOR THE SAKE OF THE MORALITY OF THE PORTERESS IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE THAT THESE PRECIOUS SPECIMENS WERE NOT PRESENTED TO HER FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNERS AND FABRICATORS OF THEM
THIS IS THE THIRD ASSASSIN I HAVE TAKEN HERE I HOPE IT WON'T BE THE LAST M
I HAVE NO APPETITE COME NOW SAID THE CHOURINEUR WITH A BRUTAL GRIN LOOK MY MASTER IN THE FACE LIKE A JOLLY WENCH
ON THE RIGHT NEAR THE COUNTER WAS A PASSAGE WHICH LED INTO A DEN WHERE PERSONS SLEPT FOR THE NIGHT AT THREE HALFPENCE A HEAD
I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW THE CHOUETTE ILL-USED ME TO MAKE ME CRY
NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE ACTUAL AND MORAL HAPPINESS OF THE PRINCIPALITY WHOSE LABORIOUS AND STEADY POPULATION BY THEIR SOBERNESS AND PIETY PRESENTED A PURE SPECIMEN OF THE GERMAN CHARACTER
AND PRAY BE QUIET SAID THE NEGRO IN A TONE OF COMMAND
SOME ONE BRINGS MOTHER BURETTE A SHIRT WORTH THREE FRANCS
HOW GOOD IS THE GREAT GOD TO GIVE US SO FINE A DAY A TEAR CAME INTO RODOLPH'S EYE WHEN HE HEARD THIS POOR FORSAKEN DESPISED LOST CREATURE UTTER A CRY OF HAPPINESS AND DEEP GRATITUDE TO THE CREATOR BECAUSE SHE ENJOYED A RAY OF SUNSHINE AND THE SIGHT OF A GREEN FIELD
HE SHOWED HIMSELF DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE KIND ATTENTIONS OF MONSEIGNEUR BUT STILL HAS BEEN ENTIRELY RESERVED ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS LOW SPIRITS
WHO ARE YOU,--FRIEND OR FOE THE CHOURINEUR AND YOU HAVE COME TO AVENGE YOURSELF NOW YOU FIND I AM INCAPABLE OF PROTECTING MYSELF I SUPPOSE NOTHING OF THE SORT
MY LORD KNOWS THAT HIS SERVANT IS INCAPABLE OF A FALSEHOOD
IF A CRIME IS COMMITTED IT IS HERE IN THIS FILTHY SEWER THAT THE POLICE THROWS ITS CAST-NET AND RARELY FAILS TO CATCH THE CRIMINALS IT SEEKS TO TAKE
I HAVE NO ONE TO DEFEND ME THAT'S THE VERY REASON BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS,--BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO ONE TO TAKE YOUR PART,--THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEATEN YOU
MAY I ASK WHO IS M
PERHAPS RODOLPH WOULD NEVER AGAIN COME TO THE TAPIS-FRANC AND THEN HOW COULD HE WARN HIM
YOU CAME TO STEAL MY LOGS
WELL I'M GOING I'M GOING AND THE OGRESS WENT UP-STAIRS
I HAVE OFFENDED GOD DEEPLY ENOUGH
THE ONLY SOUND THAT REACHED HIS EAR WAS A LOW DULL PATTERING BUT CONTINUED NOISE OF WHICH HE WAS THEN FAR FROM DIVINING THE CAUSE
NOT SEEING ANY PERSON OR ANYTHING FOR SINCE RODOLPH HAD DROPPED THE PAPER THE COACH HAD GONE ON SEVERAL YARDS THE SCHOOLMASTER THOUGHT HE WAS MISTAKEN
HIS COMPANION WAS YOUNG PALE AND HANDSOME AND APPEARED ABOUT THIRTY-ONE OR TWO YEARS OF AGE
YES NOW I RECOLLECT PERFECTLY THAT WHEN MY LORD WAS RELATING THE HISTORY OF LA GOUALEUSE I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE VERY ODD NAME OF RIGOLETTE WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN CALL TO MIND WAS THE NAME OF A PRISON ACQUAINTANCE OF THAT POOR FLEUR-DE-MARIE WELL THEN JUST AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE MLLE
NARCISSE BOREL INQUIRED SHE OF ONE OF THE POLICEMEN WHOM SHE KNEW
AT LEAST WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE YOU SLEPT ON STRAW AND ATE BREAD
THE EXPRESSION OF THE NEGRO'S COUNTENANCE WAS AT ONCE SAD AND PENSIVE AND HE CONTINUED FROM TIME TO TIME TO GAZE ON THE SLEEPING MAN WITH THE MOST TENDER SOLICITUDE
OH HE IS A VERY REGULAR AND EXACT LODGER
SINCE YOU SIR ARE TO BE MY MASTER I BEG TO TELL YOU THAT OUR CUSTOM IS CAPITAL
HIS ACCOMPLICE SEIZED WITH A NERVOUS TREMOR COULD HARDLY SUPPORT HIMSELF AND HIS BLUE LIPS TREMBLED AS THOUGH HE WERE SPEAKING
A SHAWL OF RABBIT-SKIN WAS CROSSED OVER HER BOSOM AND TIED BEHIND
BUT WE TWO WILL BAFFLE THEM COMPLETELY IF YOU WILL LEND ME YOUR ASSISTANCE OF COURSE I WILL
BUT THEN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOUR SMELL AND SAY OH THE BLACKGUARD
SEYTON SIDED WITH HIS SISTER
YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE THE NOISE WHICH WAS MADE BY THE SHUTTING OF THE DOOR AROUSED TOM AND SARAH FROM THEIR REVERIE AND THEY ROSE AND HAVING THANKED THE CHOURINEUR FOR THE INFORMATION HE HAD GIVEN THEM THE FELLOW WENT OUT THE WIND BLOWING VERY STRONGLY AND THE RAIN FALLING IN TORRENTS
HIS NAME WAS KNOWN
RODOLPH AND HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS YOU SAW THE KIND OF PERSONS WHO FREQUENTED THE TAPIS-FRANC
ARE YOU SORRY FOR HAVING COME OUT WITH ME OH DEAR NO
I KNOW IT
WHAT!--EH!--THAT IS--INDEED--MY PROPERTY YES YOUR PROPERTY
OH TALK OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND YOU SEE HIS HORNS ADDED THE HAG AS AT THE MOMENT A MAN AND WOMAN ENTERED THE CABARET
FIE FIE
LET ME BE INSTANTLY REMOVED TO HIS CHAMBER ONCE MORE MY LORD I PLEDGE MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT BARRING CHANCES NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR MURPHY WILL SOON BE CONVALESCENT MY DEAR DAVID MAY I INDEED BELIEVE YOU YOU MAY INDEED MY LORD HEAR ME
YES YES
THEN SHE WILL ALWAYS HAVE HER SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION HANGING OVER HER ALWAYS BE BUT AN ESCAPED PRISONER AND I SHALL BE ALWAYS READY WHEN IT SHALL PLEASE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TO DESIRE AGAIN TO LAY HANDS UPON AND INCARCERATE HER I SHOULD TELL YOU MY DEAR BARON THAT WHEN DAVID LEARNED FROM MONSEIGNEUR OF THE PROPOSED ARRIVAL OF CECILY HE WAS ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED AND EXCLAIMED I HOPE THAT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL NOT COMPEL ME TO SEE THE MONSTER MAKE YOURSELF EASY REPLIED MONSEIGNEUR
SELDOM PERHAPS NEVER FOR MY OWN PART TO MAKE UP FOR A WANT OF REALITY IN ITS POSSESSION I OFTEN AMUSE MYSELF WITH PICTURES OF WHAT I WOULD HAVE IF I COULD SAYING TO MYSELF THIS IS HOW AND WHERE I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE,--THIS IS THE SORT OF INCOME I SHOULD LIKE TO ENJOY
WHAT SHALL I TELL YOU MORE
THEN HE ADDED AND WE WILL PAY YOU WELL COACHMAN THE DOOR WAS SHUT
THE WOMAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS OLD AND RATHER NEATLY DRESSED IN A BROWN GOWN WITH A PLAID SHAWL OF RED AND BLACK CHECK AND A WHITE BONNET
IN SPITE OF HIS PRESENCE OF MIND AND THE COMMAND WHICH HE HAD OVER HIMSELF RODOLPH COULD NOT QUITE CONCEAL HIS SURPRISE WHEN HE SAW SUSPENDED BY A RING OF SILVER FROM A THICK CHAIN OF METAL WHICH HUNG ROUND THE OLD CREATURE'S NECK A SMALL SAINT ESPRIT IN LAPIS LAZULI PRECISELY RESEMBLING THAT WHICH THE SON OF MADAME GEORGES HAD ROUND HIS NECK WHEN HE WAS CARRIED OFF
ALL THAT CONCERNED ME WAS TO SERVE YOU
GERMAIN BY REASON OF HIS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MLLE
WHAT IS IT TO ASCERTAIN IF ALL THAT YOU HAVE TOLD US RESPECTING THE INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES IS TRUE YOU SURELY WILL NOT GO THERE NOW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
FLEUR-DE-MARIE YOU SHALL BUILD UP YOURS FIRST I WONDER IF YOU COULD GUESS WHAT I SHOULD CHOOSE IF WISHING WERE ALL M
I COULD DO NO MORE
IT IS THAT OF THE SPLENDID CHURCH OF ST DENIS
ATHEIST CHEAT AND HYPOCRITE FULL OF STRATAGEM AND TRICK CONCEALING THE MOST DANGEROUS IMMORALITY THE MOST HARDENED SCEPTICISM UNDER AN AUSTERE EXTERIOR PROFOUNDLY VERSED IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE OR RATHER ONLY HAVING TRIED THE WORST SIDE,--THE DISGRACEFUL PASSIONS OF HUMANITY,--DOCTOR POLIDORI WAS THE MOST HATEFUL MENTOR THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THE EDUCATION OF A YOUNG MAN
THE CHOURINEUR'S HISTORY 47 V
HOW YOUR THUMPS FELL ON MY SCONCE,--I NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE IT
OH YES
BRAS ROUGE IS YOUR PRINCIPAL LESSEE HE IS NOT I PRESUME THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE
FOR SOME MOMENTS HE LOOKED AT HIS PROTECTOR IN SILENCE AND THEN SAID IN A VOICE OF DEEP EMOTION
HE HAS ONLY JUST LEFT PRISON AND HAS HIS HANDS FULL ALREADY FLEUR-DE-MARIE HAD FOLLOWED THE CHOURINEUR INTO THE TAVERN OF THE OGRESS AND HE RESPONDING TO A NOD GIVEN TO HIM BY THE YOUNG SCAMP WITH THE JADED ASPECT SAID AH BARBILLON
PASSED YEARS OF WEDDED HAPPINESS
SAY REALLY M
THIS I SUPPOSE IS THE WORK OF M
THIS I SUPPOSE IS THE WORK OF M
BRAS ROUGE DISCREETLY WITHDREW WITHOUT ASKING A WORD ABOUT TORTILLARD WHOM PERHAPS HE DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE RETURN
MR WILLIS MUCH GRATIFIED BY THE SERVICES WHICH DAVID HAD SO AUSPICIOUSLY RENDERED RAISED HIS WAGES TO TWELVE HUNDRED FRANCS TO THE EXTREME GRATIFICATION OF THE BLACK DOCTOR WHOSE FELLOWS REGARDED HIM AS A DIVINITY AMONGST THEM FOR HE HAD WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IT IS TRUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MASTER SOME FEW INDULGENCES AND WAS HOPING TO PROCURE STILL MORE
I WISH TO RECOMMEND MY PROTEGEE TO HIM
BUT THE GRAND DUKE VERY WISELY REFLECTED THAT TO HAVE A WELL-INFORMED MIND IT MUST BE SUPPORTED BY A STRONG PHYSICAL FRAME AND THAT THIS ACQUIRED THE INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES WOULD DEVELOP THEMSELVES THE MORE RAPIDLY
ONLY THINK YOU MAY YET CUT A FIGURE IN THE CAPITAL WHILST THE MILKWOMAN MUST BOIL THE POT FOR HER BRATS MILK HER COWS GATHER GRASS FOR HER RABBITS AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL GET A BLACK EYE FROM HER HUSBAND WHEN HE COMES HOME FROM THE POT-HOUSE
NEXT DAY INSTEAD OF GOING TO MONTFAUCON I WENT ON THE SIDE OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SO FRIGHTENED WAS I OF BEING DROWNED BY THE CHOUETTE
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
HIS FATHER HAS PERHAPS CARRIED OUT HIS HORRID THREAT
I WAS WRONG NO I CAN IMAGINE THAT APPEARANCES HAVE DECEIVED YOU
VIOLENTLY EXCITED BY CONSTRAINT AND THE SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF SARAH WHO PRETENDED TO FEEL STILL MORE THAN HE DID THE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES WHICH HONOUR AND DUTY PLACED BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR LIBERTY IN A FEW DAYS MORE THE YOUNG PRINCE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIMSELF
SHE IS ALL IMPATIENCE TO COMMENCE HER PART OF AUNT I CAN ASSURE YOU POOR FLEUR-DE-MARIE SEEMED UTTERLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF ALL SHE SAW AND HEARD AND GAZED WITH WONDERING AND PERPLEXED LOOKS FROM ONE COMPANION TO THE OTHER AS THOUGH FEARING TO TRUST EITHER HER EYES OR EARS
SHE SEEMED SO DELIGHTED TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCED SO EXTREME A PLEASURE IN HEARING ME PROMISE TO FOLLOW IT
I VALUE IT HIGHLY FOR IT IS A FAMILY LOOM ADDED HE WITH A HIDEOUS GRIN
AND THAT WE MAY BE BETTER ACQUAINTED WE WILL TELL EACH OTHER WHO WE ARE ADDED RODOLPH
THAT IN HIS LIFE BEFORE HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE REPULSE OF A SLAVE
WHERE IS HE THE DOCTOR LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE RECENTLY ELECTED SICK-NURSE AND AT LENGTH FOUND HIM THOROUGHLY SILENCED AND SHAMED BY HIS LATE TUMBLE ENSCONCED BEHIND THE CURTAINS OF THE BED
THE THICKLY PLATED IRON WITH WHICH IT WAS COVERED MOCKED HIS UTMOST EFFORTS
GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN US WE THEN RETREATED LEAVING MR WILLIS STUPEFIED MOTIONLESS AND BELIEVING HIMSELF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DREAM
AND IT WAS MY THINKING HOW SOON ANSWERED FLEUR-DE-MARIE NAIVELY AND RAISING HER LARGE TEARFUL BLUE EYES WITH TOUCHING CANDOUR TO HIS FACE
COME COME ALONG--NOW NO NONSENSE--WILL YOU
YOU ARE ANSELM DURESNEL AND YOU MURDERED AND ROBBED A CATTLE-DEALER ON THE ROAD TO POISSY IT'S A LIE YOU SHALL CONFESS IT PRESENTLY THE SCOUNDREL LOOKED AT RODOLPH WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE OR TRUE THAN WHAT YOU BEHOLD HERE
HONEST MECHANICS HAVE THEIR COFFEE-SHOPS AND DON'T TALK SLANG I COME HERE BECAUSE I LIKE GOOD COMPANY GAMMON SAID THE CHOURINEUR SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR OF DOUBT
RODOLPH I DO NOT MEAN THAT I CAN EVER BE THAT ONE THING IN YOU ASTONISHES ME VERY MUCH FLEUR-DE-MARIE AND WHAT IS THAT M
AFTER A LENGTHENED SILENCE THE LATTER SPOKE FIRST BY INQUIRING WHETHER IT WERE REALLY TRUE THAT THE POCKETBOOK PRESENTED TO HIM CONTAINED MONEY
THERE IS SOME ONE GETTING UP AT THE BACK OF THE COACH THE COACH STOPPED AND THE DRIVER STANDING ON HIS SEAT LOOKED BACK AND SAID
A GAMBLER A SPENDTHRIFT AND PROFLIGATE ADDICTED TO THE LOWEST VICES THAT CAN DISGRACE A HUMAN BEING HE QUICKLY DISSIPATED NOT ONLY HIS OWN FORTUNE BUT THAT OF HIS WIFE ALSO
BY WAY OF TEASING HIM PIPELET AND I WENT OUT TO HIM AND SAID COMMANDANT THERE HAS BEEN NO LADY WHATEVER TO INQUIRE FOR YOU VERY WELL
RODOLPH GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE MURPHY TOOK HIS PLACE BY HIS SIDE AND THE HORSES SET OFF AT SPEED
BUT I WIPED MY EYES THAT I MIGHT NOT BE BEATEN FOR CRYING
AS TO THE SERVICE I RENDERED YOU WHY IT IS RATHER I WHO OUGHT TO THANK YOU HOW SO YES YES M
AND MONSEIGNEUR SAYS THAT THANKS TO THE COLONEL HE IS IN THE HABIT OF FINDING EVEN THE DULLEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BEARABLE
THEN A PRETTY LITTLE NICE CLEAN ROOM ALL TO MYSELF FROM THE WINDOW OF WHICH I COULD SEE THE TREES WHILE I SAT AT MY WORK PLENTY OF FLOWERS IN YOUR CASEMENT OF COURSE OH CERTAINLY
I AM A SOMNAMBULIST THE HACKNEY-COACH STOPPED IN THE PLACE DE LA MADELAINE
IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
MURPHY WENT AWAY TO SEE ALL READY FOR THEIR DEPARTURE
HE CAN SEE IN THE DARK LIKE A CAT
THEREFORE MODESTLY PLACING A COUPLE OF FRANCS IN THE HAND OF THE PORTER HE SAID
WHIP BEHIND
WHIP BEHIND
I KNOW IT IS HER BONNET
WHY CARRY HIM OFF I HAVE TOLD YOU M
COME LET US HAVE SOMETHING LIVELY NOW
WELL IT MAY BE SAID THE CHOURINEUR AS IF THINKING IT MAY BE SO DOES IT ASTONISH YOU IT REALLY DOES
PRAY LET US HAVE IT MOTHER PONISSE FLATTERED BY THEIR COURTESY OF MANNER LEFT HER BAR AND COMING TOWARDS HER NEW GUESTS LEANED HER ARMS ON THEIR TABLE AND SAID WILL YOU HAVE A PINT OF WINE IN MEASURE OR A BOTTLE A BOTTLE OF WINE GLASSES AND SOME WATER THE OGRESS BROUGHT THE SUPPLIES DEMANDED AND THOMAS SEYTON THREW HER A FIVE-FRANC PIECE AND REFUSED THE CHANGE WHICH SHE OFFERED TO HIM
IT MAKES YOU SNIVEL DOES IT PEGRIOTTE OH NO SAID GOUALEUSE WITH A BITTERNESS OF ACCENT
PEOPLE MAY SAY WHAT THEY LIKE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AIR,--THERE UP THERE ABOVE OUR HEADS VERY WONDERFUL
PARDON MY LORD
BRAS ROUGE WITH THE DESIGN OF STILL FURTHER INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH THE PORTERESS RODOLPH RESUMED
IF YOU HAD BUT SEEN POOR CHILD
WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN DID HAPPEN
MR WILLIS WAS ATTACKED BY IT BUT SOON RESTORED THROUGH THE CAREFUL ATTENTIONS AND EFFICACIOUS REMEDIES OF DAVID
CERTAIN THAT HE COULD NOT MISTAKE SARAH'S VIEWS THE DOCTOR WAS SORELY PERPLEXED
I WENT INTO A SHOP WHERE THEY SELL READY-MADE LINEN AND ASKED FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AS I WOULD NOT TELL A STORY I SAID I HAD JUST LEFT PRISON
3
NO NO
NO NO
THIS GIRL HAS BEWITCHED ME
AND SIX MONTHS AGO THE HUSBAND OF MADAME GEORGES HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE BAGNE
R SURMOUNTED BY A HELMET AND SUPPORTED BY A CROSS OF THE LEGION OF HONOUR
YES THE CHOUETTE
D'HARVILLE SHE WAS HIS MOTHER'S COUSIN AND HER MOST INTIMATE FRIEND
AS SOON AS I SAW THE PORTER I PRETENDED TO CRY VIOLENTLY SAYING THAT I HAD LOST A PET PARROT COCOTTE,--A LITTLE DARLING THAT I ADORED
AND BESIDES REALLY YOU TALK LIKE A MERE CHILD WHEN YOU SAY YOU CANNOT SAVE MONEY OUT OF SUCH LARGE EARNINGS ADDED LA GOUALEUSE IN A SWEET BUT FOR HER SEVERE TONE
AFTER A STRUGGLE OF A FEW MINUTES THE CHOURINEUR ALTHOUGH OF ATHLETIC BUILD AND A FIRST-RATE CHAMPION IN A SPECIES OF PUGILISM VULGARLY TERMED THE SAVATE FOUND THAT HE HAD GOT WHAT THEY CALL HIS MASTER
FIRST OF ALL I THINK YOU SAID YOU COULD EARN FIVE FRANCS A DAY YES SO I CAN WHEN I CHOOSE TO WORK AH
YOU MUST BE AN AWFUL MAN FOURLINE FOR EVEN I WAS FRIGHTENED!--YES I QUICK QUICK FOR THE ALLEE DES VEUVES SAID THE RUFFIAN SECURELY CLOSING THE DOUBLE FLAP OF THE TRAP WITH A BAR OF IRON
HE LOOKED AT HER WITH SURPRISE
AND THEN SHE IS SO PARTICULAR!--YOU SHOULD SEE HER
BLOOD FLOWED FLOWED EVERYWHERE BLOOD AS THOUGH WE WERE IN THE BONE-HOUSE,--I SWAM IN IT THE BRIGAND LOWERED HIS HEAD WITH A SOMBRE SULLEN AIR AND WAS SILENT
EVEN THE ESTATE TO WHICH MADAME GEORGES DURESNEL HAD RETIRED WAS INVOLVED IN THE GENERAL RUIN OCCASIONED BY HER WORTHLESS HUSBAND'S PASSION FOR PLAY AND HIS DISSOLUTE MODE OF LIFE
THROUGH THE MEDIATION OF OUR GOOD ABBE LAPORTE AH THE DEAR ABBE SAID RODOLPH DESIROUS OF ESCAPING THE PRAISE OF MADAME GEORGES
GROPING ABOUT THE PLACE ON ALL FOURS WITH THE WATER HALF WAY UP HIS LEG RODOLPH FELT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR THE WEAPON HE SO MUCH DESIRED TO FIND
COME WE WILL TAKE THE PRINCE FOR A FRESH THEME OF CONVERSATION
I HAVE HOWEVER PARTICULARLY OBSERVED THAT ON THOSE OCCASIONS THE ONE-EYED WOMAN ALWAYS HAS A LARGE BUNDLE WITH HER IN HER BASKET AND THAT M
I WOULD RATHER SLEEP ALL MY LIFE ON THE WRETCHED STRAW BED IN MY COCK-LOFT THAN SLEEP FIVE OR SIX NIGHTS ONLY IN A GOOD BED
BUT STOP A BIT
AN HOUR
AN HOUR
THE SUN WAS BRIGHT AND THE SKY CLOUDLESS WHILST THE AIR FRESH AND CRISP CIRCULATED FREELY THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS
WELL SINCE YOU CAN'T SPEAK THIS VERY FINE LANGUAGE I TELL YOU IN PLAIN FRENCH THAT BRAS ROUGE IS A SMUGGLER AND BESIDES THAT HAS A SMALL TAVERN IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
RODOLPH TOO LATE MADAME GEORGES
HIS REGULAR AND HANDSOME FEATURES WITH THE AIR OF DIGNITY PERVADING HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES A STRIKINGLY ATTRACTIVE MAN
WE WERE TAKEN FOR RICH ENGLISHMEN
THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE REIGNED WITHIN
THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO STIFLE ME WITH HEAT WAS IT
ALWAYS IN ROUND FIGURES YOU SEE,--A CHILD COULD UNDERSTAND IT
THE KIND WALTER MURPHY WAS BY NO MEANS A SAGE AND COULD ONLY CONVEY TO RODOLPH SOME PRIMARY INSTRUCTION
HAND ME THE CASH AND I WILL HAND YOU THE POCKETBOOK BUT HE'LL TRAP YOU CHOUETTE OH NO HE WON'T
RODOLPH THAT THANKS TO THESE WALKS MY ROSE-TREE LIVED AT LEAST TEN DAYS LONGER THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE HAD I NOT TAKEN SUCH PAINS WITH IT NO DOUBT OF IT
AFTER LONG AND MATURE CONSIDERATION HE SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT THE WIFE OF HIS FRIEND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNKNOWN FEMALE IN THE BLUE FIACRE
I PITY ANYBODY WHO IS UNDER YOU
THIS WAY
OF COURSE I SWEAR IT
GOOD
GOOD
GOOD
IT IS SUCH RUFFIANS YOU GET YOUR LIVING BY WILL YOU HOLD YOUR JAW SAID THE AMAZON WITH A THREATENING GESTURE AND LIFTING AS SHE SPOKE THE PITCHER SHE HELD IN HER HAND
HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND SLOWLY HIS FOREFINGER POINTED TO THE ROOF AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COLONIST SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE GOD AND THEN WAS SILENT
YOU SEE PLAIN ENOUGH HE IS NOT HERE I WAS GOING AWAY SAD ENOUGH WHEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN I SAW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLAR ANOTHER DOOR
BESIDES WHICH HE SELLS ALL MANNER OF REMEDIES FOR ALL SORTS OF COMPLAINTS,--DISEASES OF THE LUNGS COUGHS COLDS EVERY COMPLAINT YOU CAN NAME
MURPHY WELL WELL DON'T LET US SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT
BUT I COULD NOT LEAD SUCH A LIFE
HE WOULD POISON ME FIRST AND ROB ME AFTERWARDS WELL THEN WHERE SHALL I TAKE YOU I KNOW NOT
THE CARTILAGES OF HIS NOSE WERE DIVIDED AND TWO MISSHAPEN HOLES SUPPLIED THE LOSS OF NOSTRILS
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME ARE YOU M
SHE WORKS BETTER THAN A MAN AND YOU SAID RIGHT FOURLINE
SO NOW NOBODY'S LETTERS CAN BE MISLAID
AND THEN I GAINED TEN AND SOMETIMES FIFTEEN SOUS WHICH I GAVE TO THE CHOUETTE WHO SEARCHED ME ALL OVER AND EVEN LOOKED IN MY MOUTH TO SEE IF I HAD KEPT BACK ANYTHING WELL FIFTEEN SOUS WAS A GOOD HAUL FOR A LITTLE BIRD LIKE YOU IT WAS
HIS LIMBS SUNK FROM UNDER HIM AND HE SLID UNRESISTINGLY DOWN THE STONE STEPS
THE BLACK DOCTOR TREMBLED LEST ALL THIS CAUTION SHOULD LEAD TO A SECOND MISADVENTURE BUT HAPPILY THE PHIAL REACHED ITS DESTINATION IN SAFETY
THE BOTTLE BEING BROUGHT AND SARAH AND HER BROTHER SEATED WITH THE CHOURINEUR AND THE OGRESS WHO HAD CONSIDERED A SECOND INVITATION AS SUPERFLUOUS THE CONVERSATION WAS RESUMED
A WORN-OUT IRON SIGN SWUNG HEAVILY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON ITS CREAKING HINGES AND THROUGH THE RUST THAT COVERED IT MIGHT STILL BE SEEN A RED HEART PIERCED WITH AN ARROW
THEN ADDED EXCUSE ME ONE INSTANT SIR
THAT DOES TOUCH ME HUSH
HER ACUTE PENETRATION CORRECT JUDGMENT AND LIVELY WIT UNMIXED BY THE SLIGHTEST ILL-NATURE MADE HER WAGE AN EARLY THOUGH GOOD-TEMPERED WAR WITH THOSE VAIN AND EGOTISTICAL BEINGS WHO CROWD AND OPPRESS SOCIETY WITH THE VIEW OF MONOPOLISING GENERAL ATTENTION AND BLINDED BY THEIR OWN SELF-LOVE EXPECT ONE UNIVERSAL DEFERENCE AND SUBMISSION
IF SAID THE CHOURINEUR IN A STIFLED VOICE YOU DO BUT LET GO MY NECKCLOTH I WILL BITE YOUR NOSE OFF MY NOSE IS TOO SMALL MY LAD AND YOU HAVEN'T LIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE IT COME UNDER THE HANGING GLIM'[4 THERE 4 UNDER THE LAMP CALLED REVERBERE
HE WROTE AMONGST OTHER LETTERS ONE OF EIGHT PAGES TO THE GRAND MARSHAL AND DICTATED TO ME ONE EQUALLY LONG TO THE CHIEF OF THE UPPER COUNCIL THE PRINCE HERKHAUESEN-OLDENZAAL HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COUSIN YOU KNOW THAT HIS SON PRINCE HENRY HAS ENTERED AS LIEUTENANT IN THE GUARDS IN THE SERVICE OF HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA YES
AND WE MIGHT SAY YOU WERE A CONFIRMED INVALID AND REQUIRED GREAT CARE AND PERFECT RETIREMENT
IN A WORD THIS CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE BROTHER AND SISTER CLEARLY DEVELOPED THEIR UNBOUNDED SELFISHNESS THEIR AMBITIOUS CALCULATIONS THEIR IMPATIENCE WHICH ALMOST AMOUNTED TO HOMICIDE AND LAID BARE THE SPRINGS OF THAT DARK CONSPIRACY CROWNED BY THE MARRIAGE OF RODOLPH
I NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE IT
ONLY LET ME FIRST LOOK ABOUT ME FOR A MOMENT THE CHOURINEUR THEN RAN TOWARDS THE COACH WHICH WAS SOME DISTANCE OFF LOOKED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY OVER THE PLAIN WITH A KEEN AND RAPID GLANCE AND THEN REJOINED RODOLPH RUNNING QUICKLY
WHILE THE GOLDEN FRUIT AND VERDANT FOLIAGE OF THE ONE CONTRASTED BEAUTIFULLY WITH THE RICH CLUSTERS OF WAXEN FLOWERS OF ALL COLOURS WITH WHICH THE OTHER WAS LOADED
BUT I HAVE PAID FOR MY SLASHING BY GOING TO THE HULKS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
AND AS FOR M
PIPELET MUST DRINK MY HEALTH IN IT WHEN I AM GONE YOU ARE EXTREMELY KIND SIR SAID THE PORTER
AND THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT WITHOUT A SHELTER FOR HERSELF OR INFANT SON BUT FOR THE KIND AFFECTION OF HER RELATION THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE WHOM SHE LOVED WITH THE TENDERNESS OF A SISTER
SUCH WERE THE GUESTS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC WHEN THE UNKNOWN THE CHOURINEUR AND THE GOUALEUSE ENTERED
A FRINGE OF EYELIDS SO LONG THAT THEY CURLED SLIGHTLY HALF VEILED HER LARGE BLUE EYES WHICH HAD A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION
WERE THEY ALONE HERE INQUIRED SARAH
THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS WERE COMPLETELY METAMORPHOSED
THAT IS ALL FAIR ENOUGH
TO PREVENT THIS I SAID TO MYSELF I MUST GO AND PLANT MYSELF SOMEWHERE WHERE I MAY GET A VIEW OF THE WALLS THE GARDEN-GATE,--THERE IS NO OTHER ENTRANCE
BUT COMBINED WITH THE ECLAT OF HIGH BIRTH AND EXALTED RANK HE WAS A PERSON OF FIRST-RATE IMPORTANCE IN EVERY CIRCLE IN WHICH HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AND WHOSE NOTICE WAS ASSIDUOUSLY SOUGHT FOR
RODOLPH SAID MADAME GEORGES PRESENTING GOUALEUSE TO RODOLPH
AND YOUR FEMALE PAWNBROKER WAS SHE MORE CHARITABLE VERY MUCH AFTER THE FASHION OF M
BUT HOW
TO BE SURE I GOT IN
AND SO FOR THIS TIME THE SCHOOLMASTER'S HAPLESS SON ESCAPED HIS PURSUERS
WELL MAN NEVER MIND
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FIRST SAMPLE,--THE OPEN AIR HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE AND I WILL TASTE YOUR CUTLETS YOU ARE VERY KIND M
HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF-STYLED FAN-PAINTER
YOU SAY THERE ARE SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN GOLD IN A CABINET SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN GOLD EXCLAIMED THE CHOUETTE
WHERE I CAME FROM ANSWERS HE
WHERE HAS HE BEEN THIS REMARK MADE RODOLPH SMILE WHILST FLEUR-DE-MARIE THUS CONTINUED
I SPRANG AT THE CHOUETTE
I HAD NOT SEEN HIM PREVIOUSLY TO THIS EVENING FOR A VERY LONG TIME
SINCE WHICH PERIOD BY ORDER OF MY LORD FRESH INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS THE RESULT
OH I HAVE WOKE ALL IN A PERSPIRATION FROM SUCH DREAMS HUNDREDS OF TIMES SINCE THAT INFAMOUS CABRION BEGAN PERSECUTING ME WHY HONESTLY SPEAKING I CANNOT SAY THE CHASE WOULD BE A VERY AGREEABLE ONE EVEN THOUGH BUT A DREAM
WELL YOU DO AS SHE WISHES YOU
HOW I SUFFERED
HOWEVER HE DID GO
HE WAS THEIR IDOL
VERY WELL EXCLAIMED HE HALF MAD AND HALF ASHAMED OF BEING LAUGHED AT AND BUTTONING UP HIS COAT HE WALKED OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD
AN ATTACHE DEPUTED TO WATCH FOR HIS ARRIVAL HASTENED IMMEDIATELY TO APPRAISE THE AMBASSADRESS OF THE APPEARANCE OF HER ILLUSTRIOUS GUEST
AFTER MATURE CALCULATION HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO HAVE ACHIEVED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS
SARAH WAS ON THE POINT OF RENOUNCING HER ENTERPRISE IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES SO INSURMOUNTABLE
HIS STEPS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT IRREGULAR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE FREQUENT LIBATIONS OF THE EVENING WERE SOON UNHEARD AMIDST THE WHISTLING OF THE STORM AND THE SHEETS OF RAIN WHICH DASHED AGAINST THE WALLS
TELL ME WHERE IS SHE
I SAID TO MYSELF THIS MORNING I KNOW THE RENDEZVOUS OF THE CHOUETTE AND THE TALL MAN
I HAVE USED THE KNIFE IT IS TRUE BECAUSE WHEN THE BLOOD COMES INTO MY EYES I SEE RED AND I MUST STRIKE IN SPITE OF MYSELF
I WAS INDEED WELL WHAT THEN YOU SAID TO ME GOOD DAY CHOURINEUR GOOD DAY M
AND WHAT IS DONE IS DONE
THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE HIDDEN IN AN ALLEY OPPOSITE THE TAPIS-FRANC SAW THE CHOURINEUR GO DOWN THE STREET IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STREET IN WHICH THE HOUSE IN RUINS WAS SITUATED
I DARE SAY IT IS SOME PERSON WHOSE TEETH M
NOT AT ALL COMMANDANT
WHAT A SELFISH WRETCH MUST I BE TO THINK ONLY OF MYSELF
DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED
I WILL LIVE FOR VENGEANCE,--FOR DEEP AND FEARFUL VENGEANCE AND AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FROM THE CHAIR HOLDING HIS CLENCHED FISTS IN A MENACING ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CEILING AS THOUGH CALLING UPON HEAVEN TO WITNESS THE FIXEDNESS OF HIS RESOLVE
IT WAS THE CHOURINEUR WHO HAD ENTERED THE CELLARS OF THE HOUSE TO GET SHELTER FROM THE RAIN
THE LOVERS SECRET WAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED FOR SOME TIME
HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE PISTOL HE CARRIED WITH HIM AND AT THE RISK OF INJURING HIMSELF IN THE ATTEMPT HE DETERMINED TO FIRE IT OFF AGAINST THE DOOR SO AS TO DISTURB SOME OF THE FASTENINGS BY THE CONCUSSION
AS THE CHOURINEUR APPROACHED THE BED HE AGAIN SMASHED BENEATH HIS TREAD SOME OF THE FALLEN RELICS OF THE FORMER POTION
I PREFERRED SINGING TO WORK AND PARTICULARLY WHEN I SAW THE SUN SHINE
IN PARIS ALL THE LEAVES WITHER SO SOON
HE CANNOT MAKE HIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IF THE MAN THINKS ME CURIOUS I KNOW WHAT TO DO
THAT'S MY DESCRIPTION SAID RODOLPH'S COMPANION MAKING HIM A MILITARY SALUTE WITH HIS LEFT HAND
YOU DISTURB ME TWISTING AND FIDGETING ABOUT IN THAT MANNER,--YOU DISTRACT MY ATTENTION
YOU SLEEP THEN AT TEN SOUS DO YOU SAID THE CHOURINEUR RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP
BUT TO GIVE AID INCONSIDERATELY TO WELL-MERITED DEGRADATION TO PROSTITUTE AND LAVISH CHARITY AND COMMISERATION BY BESTOWING HELP ON UNWORTHY AND UNDESERVING OBJECTS IS MOST INFAMOUS
HERE MIGHT BE SEEN GIGANTIC BANANAS STRETCHING THEIR TALL ARMS TO THE GLASS ROOF WHICH COVERED THEM AND BLENDING THE VIVID GREEN OF THEIR PALMS WITH THE LANCEOLATED LEAVES OF THE LARGE MAGNOLIAS SOME OF WHICH ALREADY DISPLAYED THEIR MATCHLESS AND ODORIFEROUS FLOWERS WITH THEIR BELL-SHAPED CALICES PURPLE WITHOUT AND SILVERY WHITE WITHIN FROM WHICH STARTED FORTH THE LITTLE GOLD-THREADED STAMENS
RODOLPH EXCLAIMED THE SCHOOLMASTER BREAKING OUT FRESH AT THE MENTION OF HIS NAME
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE AGENT YOU EMPLOY I SUPPOSE OH HE IS A RARE FELLOW
IN A CONVERSATION OF ABOUT AN HOUR WITH FLEUR-DE-MARIE I HAVE DISCOVERED TREASURES OF GOODNESS WORTH PRUDENCE,--YES PRUDENCE OLD MURPHY
ONE OF SARAH'S LETTERS TO HER BROTHER WAS ABSTRACTED BY POLIDORI THE CHANNEL OF THEIR MUTUAL COMMUNICATIONS
AND WHEN MURPHY YESTERDAY PROPOSED TO YOU EMPLOYMENT A LITTLE MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF YOUR HABITUAL TOIL YOU ACCEPTED IT WITH JOY WITH GRATITUDE WHY M
TWO MORE DAYS OF SUCH RAIN AND THE WATER WILL OVERFLOW THE ARCHES OF THE BRIDGE YOU SAY THAT WE ARE THERE BUT WHERE THE DEVIL IS THE CABARET
I BROUGHT IT WITH ME FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD BE COLD LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH ATTENTION THE POOR GIRL LOOKED AT RODOLPH WITH SURPRISE
RODOLPH ADDRESSED THE SCHOOLMASTER ETCHING BY MERCIER AFTER THE DRAWING BY FRANK T
RIGOLETTE DEMANDED RODOLPH
AFTER HAVING SWALLOWED A FEW SPOONFULS OF THE MIXTURE RODOLPH BEGAN TO STIR IN HIS BED AND FAINTLY MOVED HIS HANDS
I CAN'T STIR FROM HER
YOU HAVE THE MEANS OF PROVIDING FOR YOURSELF
WHAT DO YOU SAY
LET US BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING SAID THE CHOURINEUR
IF IT IS NOT WHY WE CAN DO THE JOB ALONE CHAPTER XV
BEGONE AND WHITHER AM I TO GO EXCLAIMED HE WITH THE MOST UNBOUNDED RAGE
AFTER HAVING RUN ABOUT IN THIS WAY FOR SOME TIME SHE BECAME RATHER TIRED FOR SHE HAD LOST THE HABIT OF EXERCISE AND STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH SITTING DOWN ON THE TRUNK OF A FALLEN TREE WHICH WAS LYING AT THE EDGE OF A DEEP DITCH
AND AS THIS ILL-LOOKING SCOUNDREL MAKES YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE I WILL KICK HIM OUT THOU SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
FOR THOSE WHO STEAL THE DARBIES TO THEIR HEELS
ON THE SEAT WHICH WAS COVERED BY A RICH HAMMERCLOTH TRIMMED WITH A MOSSY SILK FRINGE SAT A PORTLY-LOOKING COACHMAN WHOSE HEAD WAS ORNAMENTED BY A THREE-CORNERED HAT WHILE HIS ROTUND FIGURE LOOKED STILL MORE IMPOSING IN HIS DRESS LIVERY-COAT OF BLUE CLOTH TRIMMED UP THE SEAMS WITH SILVER LACE AND THICKLY BRAIDED WITH THE SAME MATERIAL
AND BESIDES I AM SURE MY LORD WILL FIND A FINE FIELD FOR OBSERVATION IN THE HOUSE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK
WHY LOOK AT IT
WHO WOULD THINK NOW TO SEE HIM LYING THERE SO HELPLESS HE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN THE MAN TO GIVE ME SUCH A PRECIOUS DRUBBING AS I GOT FROM HIM
THOMAS AND SARAH TURNED TOWARDS THE CHOURINEUR
BUT LET US BE JUST MY DEAR MURPHY
THIRTEEN HAD EVER BEEN RODOLPH'S UNLUCKY NUMBER
THEN THE OGRESS ACCOSTING RODOLPH WITH ONE OF HER MOST GRACIOUS SMILES,--A THING UNHEARD OF AND ALMOST DEEMED FABULOUS IN THE ANNALS OF THE WHITE RABBIT,--ROSE FROM THE BAR TO TAKE THE ORDERS OF HER GUEST AND KNOW WHAT HE DESIRED TO HAVE FOR THE REFRESHMENT OF HIS PARTY,--AN ATTENTION WHICH SHE DID NOT EVINCE EITHER TO THE SCHOOLMASTER OR THE SKELETON TWO FEARFUL RUFFIANS WHO MADE EVEN THE CHOURINEUR TREMBLE
AND SARAH WHOSE QUICK EYE EASILY PERCEIVED IT CONTINUED
HOW GLADLY WOULD I NOW ACCEPT YOU CRIED THE WRETCHED MAN
SOME HUMMED POPULAR AIRS IN A LOW KEY
MONSEIGNEUR HAS ALWAYS EVINCED SUCH A HORROR OF HER AND THAT HORROR HE STILL EXPERIENCES
IF MY AUNT WAS A MAN SHE'D BE MY UNCLE AS THE PROVERB SAYS
WHEN MY HUSBAND THE POOR WOMAN SHUDDERED AS SHE PRONOUNCED THE WORD WAS ARRESTED ON THE FRONTIER AND THROWN INTO PRISON WHERE I WAS ALLOWED TO VISIT HIM HE SAID TO ME THESE HORRIBLE WORDS
HE HAD PROMISED MR WILLIS TO RETURN AND HE DID SO
THEY ARE SO COOL AND LOOK SO PRETTY YES YES,--GREEN BLINDS TO THE WINDOWS
AND I MUST PAY HIM THE COMPLIMENT DUE TO HIS BLOWS,--HE PAID ME OFF AS YOU DID SOME LITTLE TIME AGO HE IS THEN A CRIMINAL WHO HAS SERVED HIS TIME HE WAS SENTENCED FOR LIFE BUT ESCAPED ESCAPED AND NOT DENOUNCED I'M NOT THE MAN TO DENOUNCE HIM
AT THIS MOMENT TWO PERSONS WHO HAD COME FROM PARIS IN A CABRIOLET ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP
OUT OF THIRTY NEGROES DANGEROUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS FATAL DISEASE ONLY TWO PERISHED
AND HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED THE POWER GRANTED TO YOU
THEN AT NOON THE CHOUETTE GAVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF BREAD AH EATING SO LITTLE HAS KEPT YOUR FIGURE AS FINE AS A NEEDLE GIRL
ONE MOMENT FINETTE
RODOLPH ARE AT BRAS ROUGE'S
YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY
IT WAS A REAL SHAME FOR THE CAP WAS A DOWNRIGHT BEAUTY
MURPHY THEN DISENGAGED HIMSELF AND I WAS ALONE WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER
THE LADY WAS CALLED MOTHER PONISSE
HE IS COMING TOWARDS US
LET ME NOT ADD IMPIETY AND SACRILEGE TO MY SINS AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE RODOLPH AGAIN RENEWED THE CONVERSATION AND KINDLY TAKING THE HAND OF LA GOUALEUSE SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE TELL ME HONESTLY HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO LOVE NEVER M
I WILL PAY FOR THE SUPPER
THE BALL 323 LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS
THAT WAS MORE THAN MY SHARE
HER ONLY COVERING AND BED WAS STRAW
BUT THEY DID NOT HEAR ME CRY OUT IS IT FAR OFF THEY WOULD BE HERE IN TEN MINUTES LET US CALL OUT FOR HELP
WHERE IS HE WOUNDED DAVID IN THE RIGHT SIDE MY LORD
THE CHOURINEUR GOT UP BEHIND AND AT ONE O'CLOCK IT STOPPED ON THE BOULEVARD DE L'OBSERVATOIRE AND THOMAS AND SARAH WENT DOWN A NARROW ENTRANCE WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND
THUS EACH COUNTENANCE THANKS TO THE GENTLE ARTS YOU PRACTISE IS MADE TO EXHIBIT THE MOST SMILING DELIGHT FOR PERFECT CONTENT WILL SET OFF EVEN HOMELY FEATURES
WHEN THE BURNERS WERE NOT AT WORK I PICKED UP SOME DRY WOOD AT ROMAINVILLE SET LIGHT TO IT AND BROILED MY STEAK UNDER THE WALLS OF THE BONE-HOUSE
THEN AS THOUGH TO WHILE AWAY THE FEARFUL APPREHENSION OF AN UNFAVOURABLE OPINION HE CONTINUED TO DELIVER HIS THOUGHTS ALOUD AFTER THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THAT WAS AS IT SHOULD BE AND IT WAS A FINE LESSON
YOU ARE VERY GRAND WITH YOUR GRAMMAR IT IS MY PROFESSION AS A SCHOOLMASTER HE MADE ME THEN OBSERVE THAT IF HE WOULD NOT GO ON THIS LAY HE DID NOT DESIRE TO DISCOURAGE ANY OTHER PERSON AND THAT YOU WOULD WILLINGLY LEND A HAND IN THE AFFAIR MAY I WITHOUT IMPERTINENCE ASK WHY YOU APPOINTED A MEETING WITH THE CHOURINEUR AT ST OUEN YESTERDAY WHICH GAVE HIM THE ADVANTAGE OF MEETING THE CHOUETTE
WHAT I
SUCCEEDED HIS FATHER CHARLES FREDERIC RODOLPH 21ST APRIL 1785
DURING THE HALF-HOUR WHICH THE OGRESS ALLOWED ME TO PASS ON THE QUAY ON MARKET-DAYS I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE AND ON RETURNING TO THE OGRESS AND THOSE FILTHY STREETS OH WHY THEN I RETURNED MORE SAD THAN WHEN I SET OUT
IT WOULD BE HIGHLY DANGEROUS AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE TO EXPOSE HIM TO THE SLIGHTEST AGITATION YOU ARE DECEIVING ME AND HE IS DEAD
I CHOSE THE MOST SPICY ATTIRE THAT MOTHER HUBART HAD,--YOU ADVANCED ME THE MONEY TO PAY HER,--AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I WAS AS SMART AS A LANDLORD OR A DENTIST
I WOULD SAY THAT THE CHOURINEUR NEARLY TOLD ME ALL THAT THE TALL GENTLEMAN IN MOURNING WITH HIS TWO THOUSAND FRANCS REQUIRED GOOD NOT SO GOOD YOUNG MAN
WITH THE GREATEST OF PLEASURE SIR I WILL ATTEND TO ALL YOU REQUIRE
THIS CLASSICALLY SEVERE MODE OF HEAD-DRESS GAVE TO THE PROFILE OF THIS IMPERIOUS WOMAN THE CHARACTER AND RESEMBLANCE OF AN ANTIQUE STATUE
QUICK ONLY WAIT ONLY WAIT TILL I FIND IT TILL I SEE IT FOURLINE AND THEN THE CURSED CHOUETTE TURNED AND POKED ABOUT US LIKE AN OLD BIRD OF MISCHIEF AS SHE WAS
I'LL SKIN HER ALIVE THAT INFERNAL OLD HAG IF I CAN CATCH HER
BUT YOU VEX ME BY NOT SEEMING TO LIKE MY HELP
WE HAVE NO INSTRUCTIONS TO PROCEED FURTHER IN OUR INVESTIGATIONS BUT FROM SOME WORDS WHICH ESCAPED THE PORTERESS THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND IN THIS HOUSE CERTAIN INDICATIONS OF WHERE THE SCHOOLMASTER'S SON MAY BE HEARD OF THROUGH THE MEANS OF MLLE
SHE'S TRUE AS STEEL AND IS WORTH HER WEIGHT IN GOLD TO WATCH FOR US TO GET INFORMATION OR IMPRESSIONS OF KEYS TO CONCEAL STOLEN GOODS OR SELL THEM,--NOTHING COMES AMISS TO HER
SHE DID NOT ANSWER ME BUT I HEARD HER MUMBLING TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED ABOUT THE ROOM WHAT SHALL I DO THIS EVENING TO THIS LITTLE THIEF WHO HAS EATEN ALL THAT BARLEY-SUGAR
HE LOVES HER STILL
THE DIRECTION WHICH HE GAVE TO THE MIND AND BODY OF THE YOUNG PRINCE WERE SUCH AS ENTIRELY COINCIDED WITH THE VIEWS AND WISHES OF THE GRAND DUKE
STEAL YOUR LOGS MASTER
FROM THIS PERIOD DAVID HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUITE OF MONSEIGNEUR AS A MEDICAL MAN AND IS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM DAVID MARRIED CECILY OF COURSE ON ARRIVING IN EUROPE THIS MARRIAGE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY RESULTS SO HAPPY TOOK PLACE IN THE CHAPEL OF THE PALACE OF MONSEIGNEUR
TAKE CARE OF MY PLATES SHOUTED THE OGRESS
LET US ADD THAT THE LADY UNITED TO A VERY LOVELY PERSON SINGULAR ABILITIES AND VERY VARIED TALENTS
RODOLPH WITH A GESTURE AS RAPID AS IT WAS IMPERIOUS DESIRED HIM TO GO AND THEN TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE SCENE BEFORE HIM
YOU CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SERVICES SHE HAS DONE ME
YES YES MORE THAN ONCE
THE PORTER OPENED
RODOLPH UTTERLY EXHAUSTED HAD NO LONGER POWER TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF
THE GIRL RECEDED SAYING IN A FAINT AND FEARFUL TONE GOOD EVENING CHOURINEUR.[3 DON'T HURT ME 3 ONE WHO STRIKES WITH THE KNIFE
RODOLPH--OR RATHER MY LORD GOOD DAY MY EXCELLENT FRIEND
IT WAS THE CHOURINEUR
WHAT DID THEY CALL YOU ASKED RODOLPH
AFTER CONTEMPLATING HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES SARAH SAID IN ENGLISH TO HER COMPANION DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN NO
BUT AS YOU SAY THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WORKING AGAINST HIM AND SO I AM HERE GO ON MY GOOD FELLOW THE TALL MAN AND THE LITTLE WOMAN HAVE PROMISED TWO THOUSAND FRANCS TO THE SCHOOLMASTER TO DO TO YOU--I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE MATRIMONIAL INVENTORY THAT RESULTED FROM SEYTON AND SARAH'S RESEARCHES IN THE ALMANACH DE GOTHA WAS SATISFACTORY
HE IS BESIDES PRINCIPAL OCCUPIER OF A CERTAIN HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE,--A RUM SORT OF A HOUSE TO BE SURE
WHY MY LASS YOU WERE A QUEEN TO ME
THAT I WILL REPLIED THE UNKNOWN FOR THEN WE MAY LOOK INTO THE WHITES OF EACH OTHER'S EYES HE THEN MADE A DESPERATE RUSH AT THE CHOURINEUR WHOM HE STILL HELD BY THE THROAT AND FORCED HIM TO THE END OF THE ALLEY AND THEN THRUST HIM VIOLENTLY INTO THE STREET WHICH WAS BUT DIMLY LIGHTED BY THE SUSPENDED STREET-LAMP
THESE THREE PERSONS PLAY SUCH IMPORTANT PARTS IN OUR RECITAL THAT WE MUST PUT THEM IN RELIEF
MURPHY I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IF M
I AM NOT EASILY MOVED MY LORD AS YOU KNOW
I NEVER LIKE TO HAVE ANY ONE ABOUT ME BUT THE AUTHORISED HOUSEKEEPER BELONGING TO THE HOUSE WHEN SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MEET WITH THEIR APPROBATION THIS PROPOSITION SO FLATTERINGLY EXPRESSED AND THE WORD HOUSEKEEPER COMPLETELY WON MADAME PIPELET WHO REPLIED
I REMEMBER IT AS WELL AS IF IT WAS THIS VERY MOMENT,--IT WAS VERY NEAR TO NEW YEAR'S DAY AND THERE WERE A GREAT MANY SHOPS ON THE PONT NEUF ALL FILLED WITH TOYS AND I HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM ALL THE EVENING WITH THE GREATEST DELIGHT,--BEAUTIFUL DOLLS LITTLE FURNISHED HOUSES,--YOU KNOW HOW VERY AMUSING SUCH THINGS ARE FOR A CHILD YOU HAD NEVER HAD ANY PLAYTHINGS HAD YOU GOUALEUSE ASKED THE CHOURINEUR
NOR WILL MADAME DE LUCENAY BE THE ONLY ONE TO FEEL VEXATION AT HIS THUS CHANGING HIS MIND
N BEAUTIFULLY EMBROIDERED AND SURMOUNTED WITH A DUCAL CORONET
THE COLONISTS HAVE FORMED A MILITIA AND THE EXTENT OF YOUR PROPERTY THE NUMBER OF YOUR TENANTS WHO WILL DEPEND ON YOU WILL MAKE YOU THE CHIEF OF A VERY CONSIDERABLE TROOP
THE LAST GLIMMER OF REASON WAS WELL-NIGH SHAKEN FROM HER THRONE WHEN HASTY STEPS AND THE SOUND OF VOICES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR WERE HEARD
BUT I NEVER TURN NOSE INFORMER ON ANY CUSTOMER
RODOLPH AS YOU USED TO DO
AND THE MEN THEN BEGAN TO ENCOURAGE THE DOG AND CRY FIND EM
YOU MAY BE A KING IN YOUR WAY
REGRET HIM
NEVER
HIS FACE WAS FURROWED IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITH DEEP LIVID CICATRICES
YOU MOST WORTHY AND RESPECTABLE FATHER OF A FAMILY
THE SURPRISE
YOU WILL SOON DESERVE ABSOLUTION FROM THOSE SERIOUS FAULTS OF WHICH YOU HAVE RATHER BEEN THE VICTIM THAN THE CRIMINAL
A LAMP PLACED BEHIND A GLASS GLOBE FILLED WITH WATER SERVED AS A REFLECTOR
HOW BEAUTIFULLY THE SUN SHINES
MY TIME IS UP AND I AM FREE FROM SURVEILLANCE
MY DEAR CHILD HOW VERY ILL YOU HAVE DRESSED YOURSELF TO-DAY,--YOU WHOSE SHAPE MAY BE SPANNED BY TEN FINGERS
SO HE CAME DOWN-STAIRS VERY SOFTLY AND WITH QUITE A DIFFERENT MANNER TO THE PRIDE AND CONSEQUENCE HE HAD MARCHED UP WITH
HIS FOREHEAD AS FLAT AS A TIGER'S WAS HALF HIDDEN BENEATH A FUR CAP WITH LONG YELLOW HAIR LOOKING LIKE THE CREST OF A MONSTER
NOW WE SHALL BE OUT OF SPIRITS FOR A LONG TIME AS IF I WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNHAPPY
FOR PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY SAY SUCH THINGS TO ME
AFTER WHICH DURING SUMMER YOUR KIND RELATIVE WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE DIFFERENT FETES GIVEN IN THE ADJOINING PARISHES
YOU MUST PAY ME THE GLASS OF TAPE EAU D'AFF OR I'LL MAKE YOU DANCE WITHOUT MUSIC HE ADDED WITH A HOARSE AND BRUTAL LAUGH
THAT WAS NOT ALL I STILL WANTED M
REDDISH-COLOURED TROUSERS AND A GRAY BLOUSE CONFINED BY A LEATHER GIRDLE COMPLETED TORTILLARD'S COSTUME WHOSE NICKNAME WAS DERIVED FROM HIS INFIRMITY
I HAVE BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON I SHOULD LIKE TO ENJOY MYSELF A BIT,--THAT WON'T HURT ANYBODY
FOR I WAS SO FURIOUS THAT I COULD NOT SEE CLEARLY
A MONTH AFTERWARDS MY HUSBAND WAS CONDEMNED TO THE GALLEYS FOR LIFE
WHEN I SAY AN INDIVIDUAL I MEAN AN ITALIAN THOUGH HE SPEAKS AS GOOD FRENCH AS YOU OR ME EXCEPTING HIS ACCENT AND THAT IS NOTHING
THEN ADDED IN A MORE HUMBLE TONE
ONE OF THOSE IDLERS MORE INQUISITIVE THAN HIS COMPANIONS WENT AND ASKED THE BUTCHER-BOY WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
BE GAY IF YOU REALLY FEEL SO
HE IS A MONSTER,--A FIEND,--A HOLD HOLD CRIED THE CHOURINEUR
NEITHER WAS THE PANEGYRIC BESTOWED BY THE AMBASSADRESS ON MADAME D'HARVILLE AT ALL EXAGGERATED
AND THEN THEIR CHAINS APPEARED LESS HEAVY AND THEIR TOIL LESS IRKSOME
I CANNOT THINK WHY YOU SHOULD EVER BE TIRED OR DULL
YOU HAVE NO EQUAL FOR SKILL AND COURAGE
BUT HOW STUPID I AM
BESIDES WHEN YOU HAVE GOT TO FIND BREAD FOR SEVEN PERSONS WITHOUT RECKONING YOURSELF IT IS RATHER A HARD JOB I TAKE IT
MY BED WAS AN OLD BEAM AND MY PILLOW A HEAP OF LATH AND PLASTER AND THERE I SLEPT LIKE A KING WELL WELL GO ON WE HAD DRANK TOGETHER MASTER RODOLPH
ONE SHOULDER OF MUTTON POKES THE OTHER DOWN SAID THE CHOURINEUR
I SAID THEN M
TIS WELL SAID RODOLPH TO HIM YOU HAVE HEART AND HONOUR HEART
WHILST THE COLLAR OF ANOTHER SHIRT OF WHITE COTTON FELL OVER A BLACK SILK CRAVAT LOOSELY TIED AROUND HIS NECK
HIS WIFE'S HEALTH WAS QUITE RUINED BY THE FATIGUE OF NURSING HIM AND THE SEVERE WANT SHE EXPERIENCED OF COMMON NECESSARIES FOR HERSELF AND FAMILY
WHY SHE MADE ME BEG UNTIL NIGHT
HIS LIPS WERE BLANCHED
THERE ARE PEOPLE CLOSE AT HAND HE REPLIED
PIPELET WITH A DIGNIFIED AND RESIGNED AIR
SO LONG A PRISONER SHE INSPIRED THE FREE AIR WITH INDESCRIBABLE PLEASURE
THE BLINKING AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT OF THE LAMPS WHICH SWUNG TO AND FRO IN THE SUDDEN GUSTS WERE DIMLY REFLECTED IN POOLS OF BLACK SLUSH WHICH FLOWED ABUNDANTLY IN THE MIDST OF THE FILTHY PAVEMENT
BUT FOR HIS DEEP CONCERN ON MURPHY'S ACCOUNT RODOLPH WOULD HAVE MET HIS DEATH UNMOVED,--HIS CONSCIENCE ACQUITTED HIM OF ALL INTENTIONAL OFFENCE
THE BUTCHERY WAS IN THE YARD,--A VAULTED DARK PLACE PAVED WITH STONES AND LIGHTED BY A SMALL NARROW OPENING AT THE TOP
WE SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THEN TO PIERREFITTE BY A CROSS-PATH WHICH I KNOW AND I UNDERSTAND
WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE POSSESSION RENDERED RODOLPH MORE CIRCUMSPECT AND COOLED DOWN THAT VIOLENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED THE SECRET OF HIS PASSION FOR SARAH
YOU SEEM QUITE DOWN LIKE
WHAT M
AT THE END OF SOME MONTHS A TERRIBLE TYPHUS FEVER BROKE OUT IN THE PLANTATION
SUPPOSE WE GO AND FETCH THE COACH OURSELVES,--IT WILL STRETCH OUR LEGS WHAT
TRUE THE MASTER FOR WHOM MOREL HAD WORKED ADVANCED THEM A TRIFLE OUT OF RESPECT FOR A MAN HE HAD ALWAYS FOUND PUNCTUAL AND HONEST WHEN HE COULD WORK
THOUGH YOU BE AL'AYS SO SAD LIKE AND TOO PARTICULAR THE GOUALEUSE SIGHED TURNED HER HEAD AND SAID NOTHING
WHY THE CHARCOAL-MAN ONLY CAME IN FOR ONE MOMENT
THE LADY DID NOT ALIGHT BUT WHEN THE COACH STOPPED AND THE DRIVER OPENED THE DOOR SHE DESIRED HIM TO TAKE HER BACK TO WHERE SHE CAME FROM THE VEHICLE CANNOT HAVE GOT FAR BY THIS TIME EXCLAIMED THE COMMANDANT HASTENING TOWARDS THE DOOR
AND THOU WITH THE MOUSTACHE HE SAID TO RODOLPH IF THOU DOST NOT STAND FROM BETWEEN ME AND THE WENCH I'LL CRACK THY CROWN DEFEND ME
HOW MUCH WAS IT THREE SOUS ANSWERED RODOLPH MUCH AMUSED AT THE INGENIOUS METHOD OF REIMBURSEMENT EMPLOYED BY MADAME PIPELET
MURPHY SAYS I
I HAVE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN THAT SINCE THE ABSENCE OF COLONEL VERNER AND THE COUNT D'HARNEIM I HAVE THE HONOUR TO FULFIL THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAMBERLAIN AND AIDE-DE-CAMP AH APROPOS OF THE COUNT AND THE COLONEL WHEN MAY WE EXPECT THEIR RETURN
AFTER MUCH HESITATION OVERCOME BY THE MOST PRESSING ENTREATIES SARAH AND SEYTON ACCEPTED SUCH BRILLIANT OFFERS AND DECIDED ON ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES AT THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN WHERE THEY HAD BEEN FOR TWO MONTHS
THE SCHOOLMASTER SAW AT THE PRE THE GALLEYS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT YOU TO MY CRIB WHEN YOU WERE A BRAT AND HE HAS PROOFS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAD YOU FIRST WERE GENTRY COVES RICH PEOPLE MY PARENTS
HE SAID HE HAD AN INCLINATION FOR THE GIRL HIMSELF
GOOD EVENING FLEUR-DE-MARIE SAID THE OGRESS LOOKING WITH A PRYING EYE ON THE CLOTHES OF THE POOR GIRL,--CLOTHES WHICH SHE HAD LENT HER
I MADE COLD MEAT OF THE SERGEANT WOUNDED TWO SOLDIERS,--IT WAS A REAL SHAMBLES
BUT THEN WHEN I LOOKED AT THE FLOWERS AND THE SUN THEN I SAID THE RIVER WILL BE ALWAYS THERE
I SAID I AM LIKE A MAN WHO IS GRAPPLING WITH A MAD DOG TO PREVENT HIM FROM FASTENING ON SOME PASSER-BY LET ME GO AND I WILL DO YOU NO HARM SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN AN EXHAUSTED VOICE
I FEEL FOR YOU THE REGARD WHICH THE BULLDOG FEELS FOR HIS MASTER

HE TOOK THE KEY AND SAID TO US AS HE PASSED UP-STAIRS IN A JEERING SELF-COMPLACENT TONE AS THOUGH TO REVENGE HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN LAUGHED AT TWICE BEFORE YOU WILL DIRECT THE LADY TO MY APARTMENTS WHEN SHE COMES WELL PIPELET AND I WERE SO ANXIOUS TO SEE THE LADY HE EXPECTED THOUGH WE DID NOT MUCH RECKON UPON HER KEEPING HER APPOINTMENT EVEN IF SHE EVER MADE ONE THAT WE WENT AND HID OURSELVES BEHIND THE LITTLE DOOR THAT BELONGS TO THE ALLEY
MY DEAR SARAH COME HERE SARAH ROSE
THEN TURNING TO THE AMBASSADRESS HE EXCLAIMED MADAME TILL NOW I HAD NOT DEEMED SUCH WONDERS PRACTICABLE
YOU ARE A WAG AND THERE'S AN END OF THE MATTER AND HE LAUGHED LONG LOUD AND HEARTILY
BUT ALLOW ME TO CALL YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S ATTENTION TO THE VERY LOVELY PERSON WHO IS APPROACHING US
WHAT NO MORE ROWS
BUT IT WAS ONLY OF FORGERY THAT WE THOUGHT EXCLAIMED THE SCOUNDREL
WHY SHE LOOKS LIKE A WAR-HORSE WHEN HE HEARS THE BLAST OF THE TRUMPET YOU MEAN TO SEND HER AS A LOOKOUT PRECISELY SO NO
9 CLOSE TO NOTRE DAME YOU KNEW THEN WHERE I LIVED M
RODOLPH I HAVE TOLD YOU
HE IS AN ARRANT BLACKGUARD WHO DESERVES A HUNDRED DEATHS
KNOWING THAT THE HEROES OF THE GRAND DUKE'S ADMIRATION WERE GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS CHARLES XII AND THE GREAT FREDERIC MAXIMILIAN RODOLPH HAD THE HONOUR OF BELONGING TO THE ROYAL HOUSE OF BRANDENBURG RODOLPH THOUGHT REASONABLY ENOUGH THAT THE PRINCE HIS FATHER WHO PROFESSED SO PROFOUND AN ADMIRATION FOR THESE KING-CAPTAINS ALWAYS BOOTED AND SPURRED CONTINUALLY MOUNTED ON THEIR CHARGERS AND ENGAGED IN MAKING WAR WOULD CONSIDER HIS SON OUT OF HIS SENSES IF HE BELIEVED HIM CAPABLE OF WISHING TO DISPLACE THE TUDESCAN GRAVITY OF HIS COURT BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LIGHT AND LICENTIOUS MANNERS OF THE REGENCY
PERHAPS THEY MAY GIVE US SOME INFORMATION SAID SARAH STILL SPEAKING ENGLISH
IT IS SO CAPITAL
BY THE WAY SAID RODOLPH TO THE CHOUETTE DO YOU REALLY KNOW THE GOUALEUSE'S PARENTS MY MAN HAS IN HIS POCKET TWO LETTERS ABOUT IT BUT SHE SHALL NEVER SEE THEM,--THE LITTLE SLUT
RODOLPH I HAVE TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR NOT HAVING BEEN TO SEE YOU AFTER THE NIGHT WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER
AT THE MOMENT THEY REACHED THE YARD THE SHOPMAN ADDRESSING THE CHOURINEUR SAID TO HIM RESPECTFULLY
HER GOWN OF BROWN STUFF THOUGH MUCH TOO LARGE COULD NOT CONCEAL A CHARMING FORM SUPPLE AND ROUND AS A CANE
AS SOON AS YOU HAVE ASSUMED YOUR VILLAGE DRESS SAID RODOLPH SMILINGLY WE WILL TAKE YOU TO SEE THAT MILK-WHITE HEIFER MUSETTE WHO IS TO BE YOUR FAVOURITE HENCEFORWARD AND WHO IS ONLY WAITING FOR THE PRETTY COLLAR YOU DESIGNED TO ORNAMENT HER WITH
YOU SEEM EMBARRASSED SAD
OH IT CANNOT BE POSSIBLE
NOT GO BACK TO PARIS
ALL SHE SAW AND HEARD APPEARED TO HER TO PARTAKE LARGELY OF THE SUPERNATURAL
I OWN IT TO YOU IN PROOF OF THE SINCERITY WITH WHICH I AM SPEAKING BUT BEFORE ANY OTHER PERSON I SHOULD DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE BUSINESS YOU CONFESS IT THEN DO YOU I WAS DESTITUTE WITHOUT THE SMALLEST MEANS OF LIVING,--THE CHOUETTE INSTIGATED ME TO DO IT
HONOUR
THE CHOURINEUR WAS A MAN OF LOFTY STATURE AND ATHLETIC MAKE WITH HAIR OF A PALE BROWN NEARLY WHITE
MURPHY IS GOING TO PUT ME IN THE WAY OF EARNING FOUR FRANCS A DAY,--YES FOUR FRANCS A DAY I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT TO PROPOSE TO YOU MY GOOD FELLOW BETTER
YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF PRETTY GRISETTES
HAVE I DONE ANYTHING TO OFFEND YOU CAN YOU NOT MY LORD ACCOMPLISH YOUR SELF-IMPOSED TASK WITHOUT INCURRING SO MUCH PERSONAL RISK SURELY IN ORDER TO LULL ALL SUSPICION IN THE MINDS OF THE PERSONS I SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY APPRECIATE I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN FOR A TIME TO ADOPT THEIR GARB THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEIR CUSTOMS BUT ALL THIS DID NOT PREVENT YOU MY LORD LAST NIGHT IN THAT ABOMINABLE PLACE WHERE WE WENT TO UNKENNEL BRAS ROUGE IN HOPES OF GETTING OUT OF HIM SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THAT UNHAPPY SON OF MADAME GEORGES FROM BEING ANGRY AND READY TO QUARREL WITH ME BECAUSE I WISHED TO AID IN YOUR TUSSLE WITH THE RASCAL YOU ENCOUNTERED IN THAT HORRID CUT-THROAT ALLEY I SUPPOSE THEN MURPHY YOU DO NOT THINK I AM CAPABLE OF DEFENDING MYSELF AND YOU EITHER DOUBT MY COURAGE OR THE STRENGTH OF MY ARM UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TOO MANY REASONS TO FORM A CONTRARY OPINION OF BOTH
WELL AND PRAY WHAT DO YOU WANT I BELIEVE MADAME REPLIED RODOLPH LAYING A PROFOUND EMPHASIS ON THE WORD MADAME I BELIEVE THERE IS AN APARTMENT TO BE LET IN THIS HOUSE THE DEEP RESPECT IMPLIED IN HIS VOICE AND WORDS SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED THE PORTERESS WHO ANSWERED RATHER LESS SOURLY
WHY NOT WHY SHOULD WE WHAT IS THE USE OF SEPARATING
DO YOU SEE THE ROOF
THE COUNTESS I AM PERSUADED LOOKS UPON THIS DOUBLE FREEDOM FROM ALL MARRIAGE VOWS AS A SIGNAL INTERVENTION OF PROVIDENCE TO FURTHER HER VIEWS AND HER IMPETUOUS PASSION HAS BECOME MORE ARDENT THAN EVER THOUGH SHE IS WELL AWARE THAT MY LORD FEELS FOR HER THE DEEPEST AVERSION AND WELL-MERITED CONTEMPT
YOU DON'T CALL YOURSELF FINE NAMES AND TITLES,--YOU ONLY LOOK LIKE A PLAIN BODY,--YOU MUST BE POOR OR YOU WOULD NOT PERCH YOURSELF ON THE FOURTH FLOOR
17 LEAVING TORTILLARD ON THE LOOKOUT AND CONCEALED IN A CORNER
WHY I HAVE NO ILL-WILL AGAINST YOU NOR ANYBODY AND YOU ARE CERTAIN THAT HE THE MAN I MEAN IS NOT DEAD I AM AS SURE OF IT AS THAT I AM LIVING MYSELF THAT WILL AT LEAST GIVE ME ONE CRIME THE LESS TO ANSWER FOR
RODOLPH THUS LEFT ALONE CAST ANOTHER GLANCE TOWARDS THE CHAMBERS OF MLLE
ONLY IN THIS INSTANCE I WOULD FAIN HOPE THAT YOUR HABITUAL INDULGENCE MAY INDUCE YOU TO FEEL AS LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT AS POSSIBLE AT FINDING HOW IMPERFECTLY THE REALITY EQUALS YOUR EXPECTATIONS THE AMBASSADRESS THEN TOOK THE OFFERED ARM OF RODOLPH AND PROCEEDED WITH HIM TO THE OTHER SALONS WHILE THE COUNT REMAINED CONVERSING WITH THE BARON DE GRAUEN AND MURPHY WHOM HE HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FOR SOME TIME
I BEGAN THEN TO SPEND MY MONEY
I FOLLOW YOU
HAVE THEY NOT GOT HIS DESCRIPTION HIS DESCRIPTION
HE KNEW THE DEEP ATTACHMENT WHICH HIS FATHER HAD FOR HIM BUT HE ALSO WELL KNEW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF HIS PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO ALL THE DUTIES OF A PRINCE
AN OLD AND DINGY-LOOKING HAT WITH A VERY DEEP BRIM SURMOUNTED THE WHOLE
VIVE LA CHARTE CRIED THE CHOURINEUR
THAT HAS BEEN ALL THEIR DEPENDENCE FOR SOME TIME PAST
BUT PERHAPS THAT WOULD SHAKE HIM TOO MUCH AND OVERFATIGUE HIM
HE LISTENED
HE STOOD CLOSE TO HIS FATHER STANDING ON HIS SOUND LEG LIKE A HERON BY THE SIDE OF A MARSH
AND HE IS ABOUT THE UGLIEST MOST SPITEFUL ILL-DISPOSED YOUNG RASCAL ONE WOULD WISH TO MEET
HAVE I NOT ON THE CONTRARY CONFESSED THAT TO YOU WHICH I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE DARED TO OWN TO MYSELF WELL THEN COME ROUSE YOURSELF
AS ALFRED SAYS IF IT WERE TRUE IT WOULD SEND HIM TO THE GALLEYS WHY WHAT DO THEY ACCUSE HIM OF OH I REALLY CANNOT TELL YOU
I THOUGHT OF IT ALL NIGHT AND I CRIED BITTERLY
MY LORD YOU KNOW SIR HOW GREATLY I DETEST ANYTHING LIKE CONCEALMENT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME BUT IT SUITS ME TO HAVE CERTAIN CONCEALMENTS SAID MURPHY BLUNTLY
AND YET THE FIRM EXPRESSION OF HIS MOUTH THE DIGNIFIED AND BOLD CARRIAGE OF THE HEAD ASSURED US OF THE MAN OF ACTION WHOSE PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND PRESENCE OF MIND WOULD ALWAYS COMMAND AN ASCENDANCY OVER THE MULTITUDE
YES M
YES M
THE SCHOOLMASTER IS A SCOUNDREL
FIRST I BOUGHT FLOWERS TO PUT IN MY ROOM,--I DO LOVE FLOWERS!--THEN I BOUGHT A GOWN A NICE SHAWL AND I TOOK A WALK IN THE BOIS DE BOULOGNE AND I WENT TO ST GERMAINS VINCENNES AND OTHER COUNTRY PLACES
AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE SCHOOLMASTER SAID TO THE DRIVER OF THE HACKNEY-COACH
RODOLPH IN ABANDONING HIMSELF TO IDEAS WHICH WERE FREE FROM CRIMINALITY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPRING FROM THE CIRCLE OF FATAL PROBABILITIES RESOLVED THAT WHEN PROVIDENCE SHOULD CALL TO HIMSELF THE GRAND DUKE HIS FATHER HE WOULD DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE LIFE WHICH CESAR POLIDORI HAD PAINTED TO HIM UNDER SUCH BRILLIANT AND ATTRACTIVE COLOURS AND TO HAVE AS HIS PRIME MINISTER ONE WHOSE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING HE ADMIRED AND WHOSE BLIND COMPLAISANCE HE FULLY APPRECIATED
AND SHE CONSTANTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF TO BEAR OUT HER AMBITIOUS DREAM THAT A FORTUNE-TELLER HAD THUS PROMISED A CROWN TO THE HANDSOME AND EXCELLENT CREATURE WHO AFTERWARDS SAT ON THE THRONE OF FRANCE AND WHO WAS QUEEN AS MUCH BY HER GRACES AND HER KIND HEART AS OTHERS HAVE BEEN BY THEIR GRANDEUR AND MAJESTY
THERE WAS THE SAME QUICK AND CUNNING LOOK JOINED TO THAT IMPUDENT HARDENED AND KNAVISH AIR WHICH IS PECULIAR TO THE SCAMP VOYOU OF PARIS,--THAT FEARFUL TYPE OF PRECOCIOUS DEPRAVITY THAT REAL HEMP-SEED GRAINE DE BAGNE AS THEY STYLE IT IN THE HORRIBLE SLANG OF THE GAOL
THEY LODGE AT THE SAME NUMBER AS THE GOUALEUSE'S
SO I CALLS OUT TO THE STRANGER YOU ARE WRONG FRIEND YOU WANT NEXT DOOR I THINK NOT RETURNS THE VOICE
YOU MUST OWN THAT MY FRIEND IS A LUCKY FELLOW
THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN SHED THEIR LIGHT ON THIS INTERESTING YET SAD GROUP
HE'S THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
HISTORY OF LA GOUALEUSE 31 IV
UNLESS ON SUNDAY FOR MLLE
LET US PAY THE RECKONING AND TAKE A COACH IF WE HAVE A COACH I SHOULD LIKE FIRST TO SMOKE A CIGAR WHY NOT SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
YOU SAW THE MONEY,--NOTHING VENTURE NOTHING HAVE
SHE HAS NOT SENSE OR REASON TO KNOW BETTER AND WHEN SHE GETS VERY HUNGRY YOU MAY HEAR CRIES AND SCREAMS ALL DOWN THE STAIRCASE HORRIBLE EXCLAIMED RODOLPH WITH A SHUDDER
IT WAS AFTER YOU TOLD ME THAT I HAD HEART AND HONOUR BUT THAT'S NOTHING SO THERE'S AN END OF IT
IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE THE CARRIAGE PASSING BY THE LARGE ENTRANCE TO THE FARM ENTERED A THICK AVENUE OF ELM-TREES AND STOPPED BEFORE A LITTLE RUSTIC PORCH HALF HIDDEN BY THE LUXURIANT BRANCHES OF THE VINE WHICH CLUSTERED ROUND IT
TIS TRUE HE HAS BY NO MEANS REDUCED EITHER HIS ESTABLISHMENT OR HIS EXPENDITURE
DAVID WILL YOU GO AND LEARN HOW MURPHY IS ADDED RODOLPH AND RETURN AGAIN INSTANTLY THE BLACK WENT OUT
AVOIDING ALL USE OF THE UNLUCKY THUMB WHOSE UNDUE PRESSURE HE RIGHTLY CONCEIVED HAD BROUGHT ABOUT HIS PREVIOUS ACCIDENT HE KEPT SO WIDELY STRETCHED FROM HIS FOREFINGER THAT A BUTTERFLY MIGHT HAVE PASSED BETWEEN WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS WITHOUT LOSING ONE ATOM OF ITS GOLDEN PLUMAGE
AND HE WILL GO ON BELIEVING AND EXPECTING FROM DAY TO DAY BECAUSE HE IS TOO VAIN TO IMAGINE HE IS BEING LAUGHED AT
SO WHEN THE COMMANDANT THAT IS THE ONLY NAME WE KNOW HIM BY HAD LOOKED OVER THE ROOMS HE SAID TO THE UPHOLSTERER HIS FRIEND WELL I THINK THE PLACE WILL DO FOR ME,--JUST SEE THE LANDLORD AND ARRANGE ALL ABOUT IT YES COMMANDANT SAYS THE OTHER
CAPTAIN SAYS I PUTTING THE BACK OF MY HAND UP TO MY WIG BY WAY OF MILITARY SALUTE HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU BUT I AM AFRAID IT CONTAINS NEWS OF A SECOND COUNTERMARCH AGAINST YOU HE LOOKED AT ME SOUR AS A CRAB SNATCHED THE LETTER FROM MY HAND READ IT TURNED SCARLET AS A BOILED LOBSTER THEN WALKED OFF PRETENDING TO WHISTLE
RODOLPH I DECLARE YOU MAKE ME QUITE ANGRY TO HEAR YOU TALK SO CHILDISHLY
ONE DAY AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THAT INTELLIGENCE WILL BE PURIFIED BY REMORSE AND RENDERED AGAIN GUILTLESS THROUGH DIVINE EXPIATION
AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL CONTENT OURSELVES WITH STATING WHAT THE READER HAS NO DOUBT ALREADY GUESSED THAT FLEUR-DE-MARIE WAS THE FRUIT OF THE SECRET MARRIAGE OF RODOLPH AND SARAH AND THAT THEY BOTH BELIEVED THEIR DAUGHTER DEAD
YOU ARE MASTER,--I CONFESS IT
THE WHOLE OFFERING A VERY UNFAVOURABLE CONTRAST TO THE MEAN AND SHABBY-LOOKING STAIRCASE
WHEN WE REACHED HOME IT WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD A ONE-EYED OLD DEVIL'S KIN SAID THE CHOURINEUR AGAIN THUMPING THE TABLE IN HIS ANGER
SCARCELY DO I FALL INTO A DOZE THAN I WAKE STARTING WITH THE IDEA OF BEING CALLED BY THAT CURSED CABRION
THE CHOURINEUR'S HISTORY
THEN TURNING TO THE OGRESS GOOD NIGHT MOTHER PONISSE
PASSAGES IN GOTHIC BOLD ARE SURROUNDED BY +PLUS+ SIGNS
BUT I MUST BE ALLOWED TO SAY WITH ALL DUE APOLOGY FOR MY BOLDNESS THAT THERE IS NO SMALL PORTION OF PRIDE IN YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S AVERSION TO RECEIVE EVEN A JUST COMPLIMENT WELL SAID BARON
I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT BY JOVE
WHICH HAVING DONE SHE TURNED IT ROUND AND ROUND LOOKED AT IT IN EVERY DIRECTION THEN AFTER A SHORT APPEARANCE OF EMBARRASSMENT AND UNCERTAINTY SHE SAID TO RODOLPH
I WOULD RATHER TEAR HER EYES OUT WITH MY OWN HANDS
IN SPITE OF HIS SLIGHT INCOGNITO RODOLPH KEPT UP IN HIS MANSION FULL STATE AND ETIQUETTE
AND A SIMILAR INSIGNIA DECORATED THE BARON DE GRAUEN AMIDST AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THE CROSSES AND BADGES OF HONOUR BELONGING TO ALL COUNTRIES DEPENDING BY A GOLD CHAIN PLACED IN THE TWO FULL BUTTONHOLES OF THE DIPLOMATIST'S COAT
YOU WILL SEE THAT HE IS ALONE AND HE WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
SO WHEN THEY HAD GONE AWAY I GOT OUT OF MY HIDING-PLACE AND FOLLOWED THEM QUIETLY
AND BESIDES THIS DESPATCH ORDERS THE ARRANGEMENT TO BE CARRIED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THAT CECILY BE MADE TO TRAVEL HITHER SO SPEEDILY THAT SHE MAY ARRIVE HERE IN A FORTNIGHT I AM LOST IN ASTONISHMENT
HE WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF SAYING THIS TO THE GIRL WHEN HE SAW HER SUDDENLY TURN PALE WITH FRIGHT WHILST LOOKING AT THE HIDEOUS COMPANION OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND SEIZING THE ARM OF RODOLPH WITH A TREMBLING HAND THE GOUALEUSE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BUT IF THE MAN WHO LIVES HONESTLY IN THE MIDST OF HONEST MEN ENCOURAGED BY THEIR ESTEEM DESERVES ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT HE WHO IN SPITE OF THE AVERSION OF GOOD MEN REMAINS HONEST AMIDST THE MOST INFAMOUS ASSOCIATES ON EARTH,--HE TOO DESERVES ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR WHAT YOU KNOW OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TRADE OF ALL OTHERS I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN
I CAN NEVER RECOLLECT HAVING SLEPT IN WHAT IS CALLED A BED BEFORE I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OF AGE,--A HAPPY AGE!--AND THEN I BECAME A TROOPER WHAT YOU HAVE SERVED THEN CHOURINEUR SAID RODOLPH
EMBASSY AND THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE PRESENT TRUE
MR WILLIS IGNORANT OF THEIR LOVE HAD THROWN HIS HANDKERCHIEF RIGHT ROYALLY AT THE PRETTY METISSE AND SHE IN DEEP DESPAIR SOUGHT DAVID AND TOLD HIM ALL THE BRUTAL ATTEMPTS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND WITH DIFFICULTY ESCAPED
OH IN MERCY KILL ME
IF THE PROJECT APPEARS IMPROBABLE SUCH HOPES RIDICULOUS LET US FIRST REPLY BY SAYING THAT UNBRIDLED AMBITION EXCITED BY SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEF RARELY CLAIMS FOR ITSELF THE LIGHT OF REASON IN ITS ENTERPRISES AND WILL DARE THE WILDEST IMPOSSIBILITIES
HER DRESS WAS DIRTY TAWDRY AND UNTIDY
WHY THE POOR GIRL RISES AT FIVE OR SIX O'CLOCK AND WORKS INCESSANTLY TILL TEN OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT NEVER ONCE LEAVING HER ROOM EXCEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE GOES OUT TO BUY FOOD FOR HERSELF AND HER TWO CANARY-BIRDS
HAVE A CARE CRIED THE PHYSICIAN
AGAIN HE DESCENDED INTO THE CAVE IN HOPES OF OBTAINING SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT SERVE AS A LEVER TO FORCE THE HINGES OR WRENCH THE FASTENINGS
RODOLPH HOW KIND YOU ARE
IT IS CONTRARY TO MY PRINCIPLES AND HABITS TO GIVE MY HAIR TO ANY ONE,--ONLY I SHOULD HAVE REFUSED WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS REGARD TO POLITENESS THAT IS NOT ALL CHIMED IN THE PORTERESS
ONLY THEY KICK UP THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW WITH THEM WHATEVER THEY ARE
HER EXCELLENCY INSTANTLY HURRIED WITH HER NOBLE HUSBAND TO WELCOME THEIR VISITOR EXCLAIMING
INSIDE THE WALLS CONTINUED THE HORRID OLD HAG GOING ON WITH HER DESCRIPTION OF THE PREMISES INSIDE THE WALLS TRELLIS-WORK ALL AROUND,--A PERFECT STAIRCASE
AS FOR THAT THE CHOUETTE SHE TAKES OFF HER BONNET PUTS IT INTO HER POCKET AND RINGS THE GATE-BELL
THE PRINCIPAL LESSEE IS A SCREW,--A REGULAR SKINFLINT WHAT IS HIS NAME M
GOOD EVENING LA GOUALEUSE."[2 2 SWEET-THROATED
NOTWITHSTANDING THE SMALL VALUE OF THEIR COMMODITIES THE FRONTS OF NEARLY ALL THESE SHOPS WERE PROTECTED BY STRONG BARS OF IRON,--A PROOF THAT THE SHOPKEEPERS KNEW AND DREADED THE GENTRY WHO INFESTED THE VICINITY
WE HAVE NOT IN THE SCENE BEFORE US A MERE UNION OF UNBOUNDED EXPENSE WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE TASTE BUT YOU GIVE US POETRY IN ACTION
THE SCHOOLMASTER TREMBLED RETREATED A STEP AND FOR ONCE DISTRUSTFUL OF HIS GIANT STRENGTH FELT UNDER HIS BLOUSE FOR HIS LONG CUT-AND-THRUST KNIFE
I SEE YOU KNOW YOUR TRADE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
RIGOLETTE
I WILL GO THERE AND WAIT FOR THEM
THERE NOW IT IS ALL GONE AND SHALL NOT RETURN TO VEX YOU ANY MORE I AM DETERMINED
IF TO PREVENT YOU FROM FURTHER VIOLATING THE COMMANDMENTS OF YOUR MAKER I FOR EVER DEPRIVE YOU OF THE BEAUTIES OF THIS OUTER WORLD IF I PLUNGE YOU INTO IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOUR CRIMES IT IS THAT YOU MAY INCESSANTLY CONTEMPLATE THEIR ENORMITY
CHAPTER I
SHE LIVES AS SERVANT WITH AN OLD MISERLY FELLOW RICH ENOUGH TO BUY AND SELL HALF PARIS,--A NOTARY NAMED M
YET THE BURNING IMPULSES OF LOVE NEVER THROBBED BENEATH HER ICY BOSOM
I CAN HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF WHEN I SEE THAT OLD HAG AND KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED TO THE GOUALEUSE,--BUT PATIENCE A BLOW DELAYED IS NOT A BLOW LOST AS THE SAYING IS THE HOTEL DE VILLE CLOCK STRUCK MIDNIGHT
IF THEY TAKE THEM VERY WELL,--EVERY ONE TO HIS TRADE
TO CUT UP ENGLISH OR PRUSSIANS
THAT THERE AIN'T
ALL WAS THEN SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WERE HEARD FOR SEVERAL SECONDS IN THE MIDST OF THE PITCHY DARKNESS SOUNDS OF A FIERCE STRUGGLE
HE COULD BREATHE VERY WELL
FOOTNOTES ORIGINALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF A PRINTED PAGE HAVE BEEN PLACED DIRECTLY BELOW THE PARAGRAPH IN WHICH THEIR ANCHOR SYMBOL APPEARS
THE LANDS BELONGING TO IT ARE VERY FERTILE AND IN FULL BEARING
IT WAS QUITE A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT THEM AS THEY CAME DOWN-STAIRS OF A SUNDAY TO TAKE THE ONLY WALK POOR THINGS
AND NOW I AM GOING TO BE QUITE GAY YOU WILL SEE AND YOU WERE AS GAY AS COULD BE A FEW MINUTES AGO YES I KNOW I WAS
IT IS AS IF IT WERE MADE ON PURPOSE TO SIT DOWN UPON
FIRST IN ORDER APPEARED A LITTLE WAXEN SAINT JOHN WITH A VERY FAT LAMB AT HIS FEET AND A LARGE PERUKE OF FLOWING WHITE CURLS ON HIS HEAD THE WHOLE ENCLOSED IN A CRACKED GLASS CASE THE JOININGS OF WHICH WERE INGENIOUSLY SECURED BY SLIPS OF BLUE PAPER
OBSERVE WHERE WE ARE AS THE CARRIAGE STOPPED LA GOUALEUSE AT RODOLPH'S BIDDING MECHANICALLY RAISED HER HEAD,--THEY WERE ON THE SUMMIT OF A LITTLE HILL
HOW CHARMING
GERMAIN HAS NOT BEEN TO SEE MLLE
AT THE BOTTOM OF A DAMP DISMAL-LOOKING STAIRCASE A GLIMMERING LIGHT INDICATED THE PORTER'S RESIDENCE RENDERED SMOKY AND DINGY BY THE CONSTANT BURNING OF A LAMP REQUISITE EVEN AT MIDDAY TO ENLIGHTEN THE GLOOMY HOLE INTO WHICH RODOLPH ENTERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASKING LEAVE TO VIEW THE APARTMENT THEN VACANT
THE DESTINY PREDICTED FOR HER AND IN WHICH SHE FULLY BELIEVED WAS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER,--IN FACT SOVEREIGN RANK
MY FRIEND MURPHY WILL LEAD YOU OVER THE FARM AND INTRODUCE YOU TO YOUR FUTURE PROTEGES
HE SUPPED WITH YOU I FIND
THE GRAND DUKE MAY EXILE YOU FROM HIS COURT,--YOU AND YOUR WIFE,--NOTHING MORE
THE DESPERATE CONDITION OF THE MAN WAS QUITE DESERVED BY HIM THE MALADY MADE FEARFUL STRIDES
BITTERLY DID HE THEN REGRET HIS RASH AND VENTURESOME PROJECTS HOWEVER GOOD AND GENEROUS THE MOTIVES BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTIGATED
AND WHEN MY SON WAS INFORMED WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM HE WAS INDIGNANT TOLD ALL TO HIS EMPLOYER AND QUITTED NANTES
I REACHED THE BLEEDING HEART AND I LAID HOLD OF BRAS ROUGE
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A STRONG DOOR LOCKED,--IT LOOKED VERY LIKE A MONEY-CHEST
ON THIS NEW ESSAY THE MANAGEMENT OF HERSELF AND BROTHER WERE MOST MASTERLY
THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED THEM WAS TOO WIDE
1
RIGOLETTE TO TRACE THE DWELLING OF FRANCOIS GERMAIN
THE PUNISHMENT 189 XVIII
ITS ROOF COVERED WITH MOSS-COVERED TILES WAS SCARCELY SO HIGH AS THE GROUND ON WHICH RODOLPH WAS STANDING
BEFORE HE SAT DOWN THE SCHOOLMASTER TAPPED LIGHTLY AGAINST EACH OF THE DIVISIONS OF THE WAINSCOT THAT HE MIGHT ASCERTAIN THEIR THICKNESS AND POWER OF TRANSMITTING SOUNDS
AND IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE MY LORD IS DESIROUS OF EXPRESSING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT HE WISHES A COURIER TO BE DESPATCHED THIS VERY DAY TO PRINCE HERKHAUESEN-OLDENZAAL CHIEF OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL THAT IS SO LIKE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
IF THE UNHAPPY BOY STILL LIVES--IF LIKE ME HE HAS NOT CHANGED HIS NAME--OH SHAME
COME ARE YOU READY
SHE DOES NOT CONFUSE YOU WITH A HEAP OF PAPER TICKETS AND DUPLICATES,--NOTHING OF THE SORT
FOR THE CHOURINEUR HAVING YESTERDAY MORNING MET THE CHOUETTE NEAR ST OUEN DID NOT LEAVE HER FOR ONE MOMENT WHEN THE TALL GENTLEMAN IN MOURNING CAME UP SO THAT HE COULD NOT APPROACH AND CONVERSE WITH HER
I NEVER MAKE SPORT OF THE GRATITUDE AND SYMPATHY WITH WHICH NOBLE CONDUCT INSPIRES ME
RODOLPH SAID TO HER MY CHILD I WISH TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH MADAME GEORGES
MY GENTLEMAN MUST HAVE BEEN NICELY CHOUSED BY SOMEBODY
WHAT THE DEVIL MADE YOU BAWL OUT WHICH WAY WE WERE GOING BEFORE THESE PEOPLE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
THEN SHE IS WELL BEHAVED TO EVERY ONE SO MERRY AND HAPPY LIKE A BIRD THOUGH POOR THING
TWO MARVELLOUSLY ILL-FAVOURED FELLOWS WITH UNSHAVEN BEARDS AND THEIR GARB ALL IN TATTERS HARDLY TASTED OF THE PITCHER OF WINE BEFORE THEM AND CONVERSED TOGETHER IN LOW VOICES AND WITH UNEASY ASPECT
RODOLPH NO MY CHILD
PORTRAIT OF EUGENE SUE ETCHING BY BICKNELL FROM A PORTRAIT +THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS.+ ILLUSTRATED WITH ETCHINGS BY MERCIER BICKNELL POITEAU AND ADRIAN MARCEL BY EUGENE SUE IN SIX VOLUMES VOLUME I PRINTED FOR FRANCIS A
TWO NARROW WINDOWS WITH THEIR CRACKED PANES FESTOONED WITH SPIDERS WEBS CAST A DIM BUT NOT RELIGIOUS LIGHT ON THE DAMP WALLS
HE RARELY COMES NEAR THE PLACE EXCEPT WHEN HE HAS ANY PRIVATE MATTERS TO ARRANGE WITH MOTHER BURETTE
AND WHAT IN THE DEVIL'S NAME HINDERED YOU FROM LETTING ME KNOW THIS SOONER BECAUSE COMMANDANT ALFRED AND I THOUGHT WE WOULD SPARE YOU AS LONG AS WE COULD THE TIDINGS OF THIS THIRD BREAKDOWN WHICH WE FANCIED MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU COME THINKS I THERE IS SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU REMEMBER FLINGING ME OUT OF YOUR ARMS AS THOUGH IT MADE YOU SICK TO TOUCH ME
IN A SHORT TIME A BLUE HACKNEY-COACH WITH ITS BLINDS DRAWN DOWN STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE
GERMAIN YOU WERE PRAISING SO HIGHLY MADE UP FOR THE BAD TREATMENT YOU RECEIVED FROM M
BUT I THINK HE ONLY JESTED
JACQUES FERRAND SPITE OF HIS ORIGINAL POVERTY HAS INVESTED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS IN THE FUNDS THE GREATEST PART OF THIS SUM HAVING BEEN SUPPLIED TO HIM THROUGH A M
THE EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO MADAME PIPELET EXHALED THROUGH ITS HOT-PRESSED ENVELOPE A STRONG ODOUR OF RUSSIA LEATHER
MURPHY NO DOUBT RECOGNISED HIM DURING THIS CONVERSATION HELD IN A VERY LOW TONE AND IN A FOREIGN TONGUE THE SCHOOLMASTER SAID TO THE CHOUETTE LOOKING AT TOM AND SARAH THE SWELL HAS SHELLED OUT A BULL TO THE OGRESS
SHE WOULD PLUNDER ME OF EVERY SOU OH BLESS YOU
LET ME SEE WHAT NAME SHALL WE GIVE HER
ANSELM DURESNEL I WILL NOT SENTENCE YOU TO THE GALLEYS NEITHER SHALL YOU DIE THEN DO YOU INTEND SENDING ME TO HELL
I KNOW ALL YOU WOULD SAY MY EXCELLENT OLD FELLOW AND THAT WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE TAKEN AN IDEA INTO YOUR THICK SKULL THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF COULD NO MORE DRIVE IT OUT OF YOU THAN HE COULD BY ALL HIS ARTS REMOVE THE FIDELITY AND DEVOTION IMPLANTED IN YOUR BRAVE AND VALIANT HEART COME COME MY LORD NOW YOU BEGIN TO FLATTER ME I SUSPECT YOU ARE UP TO SOME FRESH MISCHIEF THINK NO SUCH THING MURPHY
SO LET'S HAVE DONE WITH HIM
SEND AND GET CHANGE FOR ONE OF THEM
RODOLPH THE CHOUETTE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER WENT TOWARDS THE COURS LA REINE
AND THAT TOO IN A BALLROOM AT THE RISK OF BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL DERISION IF THIS UNCONTROLLABLE MISERY WERE PERCEIVED
A CHILD OF THAT AGE COULD ONLY EMBARRASS HIS FLIGHT ALAS M
STRANGE CONTRAST
HE COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR THE SHUTTING OF SEVERAL DOORS AND THEN BEHIND A SMALL OVAL GLASS LET IN BESIDE THE DOOR AND ON WHICH RODOLPH HAD MECHANICALLY KEPT HIS EYES FIXED HE SAW THE HAGGARD CADAVEROUS COUNTENANCE OF A HUMAN BEING
FOR THE MANY MYSTERIOUS WORDS UTTERED BY RODOLPH HE LOOKED UPON AS MERE VAGUE EXPRESSIONS INTENDED TO ALARM HIM,--NOTHING MORE
THAT URCHIN TORTILLARD IS NEAR THE DOOR
AND I PLEDGE MY WORD OF HONOUR TO SAVE HENCEFORWARD AT LEAST FORTY SOUS A DAY THUS SPEAKING RODOLPH CALLED OUT TO THE DRIVER OF THEIR VEHICLE WHO WAS PASSING THE VILLAGE OF SARCELLES TAKE THE FIRST ROAD TO THE RIGHT CROSS VILLIERS TO BEL TURN TO THE LEFT THEN KEEP ALONG QUITE STRAIGHT NOW SAID RODOLPH TURNING TO HIS COMPANION THAT I AM A GOOD BOY AND PROMISED TO DO ALL YOU TELL ME LET US GO BACK TO OUR DIVERSION OF BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR
INDEED M
SHE SHALL BE VERY YOUNG AND GENTLE AND ENTIRELY WHITE OH WHAT A PRETTY NAME
RODOLPH AND DESCRIBE ALL ABOUT IT TO ME AND THE DELIGHTED GIRL OPENED HER LARGE LAUGHING EYES AND PRESSED MORE CLOSELY AGAINST RODOLPH AS IF SHE EXPECTED TO SEE THE PICTURE IN HIS HAND
INSENSIBLY EACH FRESH VISITANT TO THIS ENCHANTING SPOT LOWERED HIS VOICE UNTIL HIS WORDS FELL IN WHISPERS
THOSE WHO LIKE FAT CAN HAVE IT
BUT I WILL NOT TRUST TO YOUR COUNTRY DOCTORS
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SINCE A YOUNG MAN NAMED FRANCOIS GERMAIN ARRIVED IN PARIS FROM NANTES WHERE HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE BANKING-HOUSE OF NOEL AND CO
THE SERGEANT RODOLPH HASTENED TO HIM
IT BELONGS TO A FRIEND OF MINE
THAT RODOLPH EXPERIENCED NO WONDER ALWAYS SUPPOSING HIS CONJECTURES AS TO THE IDENTITY CORRECT AT FINDING A MAN WHOSE PROFOUND LEARNING RARE TALENT AND VAST INTELLIGENCE HE WELL KNEW SUNK TO SUCH A DEGRADATION,--IT MIGHT EVEN BE INFAMY,--WAS BECAUSE HE KNEW EQUALLY WELL THAT ALL THESE HIGH ATTAINMENTS AND NOBLE GIFTS WERE ALLIED TO SUCH ENTIRE PERVERSITY SUCH WILD AND IRREGULAR PASSIONS INCLINATIONS SO CORRUPT AND ABOVE ALL AN AFFECTED SCORN AND CONTEMPT FOR THE OPINION OF THE WORLD WHICH MIGHT LEAD THIS MAN WHEN WANT AND MISERY OVERTOOK HIM TO SEEK FROM CHOICE THE LOWEST AND LEAST HONOURABLE PATHS OF SUBSISTENCE AND TO ENJOY A SORT OF MALEVOLENT SATISFACTION IN THE IDEA OF HIM THE TALENTED THE LEARNED BURYING ALL THESE PRECIOUS TREASURES BENEATH THE IGNOBLE CALLING TO WHICH HE HAD DEVOTED HIS VAST POWERS OF MIND AND BODY
THE DOOR OF THE FLIGHT ABOVE WHERE DWELT THE FEMALE MONEY-LENDER AND DEALER IN DIVINATION WAS SINGULARLY CHARACTERISED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THAT MYSTICAL SYMBOL OF DEEP WISDOM AND ORACULAR KNOWLEDGE AN OWL WHICH STUFFED TO RESEMBLE LIFE AS CLOSELY AS THE ARTIST COULD CONTRIVE IT WAS NAILED ON A SMALL BRACKET JUST ABOVE THE DOORWAY
ALREADY WERE THE WATERS GURGLING IN HIS EARS
I ANSWERED I HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF DRESSING OTHERWISE YOU SAID TO ME COME TO THE TEMPLE I FOLLOWED YOU
I BOUGHT THIS FARM
ALFRED LIKES IT THICK
I CALLED FOR A QUART OF DRINK AND A QUART OF NUTS SAYING I EXPECTED SOME FRIENDS,--A HUMPBACKED MAN AND A TALL WOMAN
OUT OF DEFERENCE FOR THE SOVEREIGN REPRESENTED BY THE AMBASSADOR TO WHOSE BALL HE WAS THEN PROCEEDING RODOLPH WORE NO OTHER MARK OF DISTINCTION THAN THE DIAMOND ORDER OF ROUND THE NECK OF SIR WALTER MURPHY AND SUSPENDED BY A BROAD ORANGE RIBAND HUNG THE ENAMELLED CROSS OF THE GRAND COMMANDER OF THE GOLDEN EAGLE OF GEROLSTEIN
I SEE,--I SEE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
I AM LISTENING,--GO ON
ON THE RETURN OF RODOLPH AND MURPHY ALL THREE COMBINED BY ONE COMMON INTENT TACITLY LEAGUED AGAINST THE SQUIRE THEIR MOST REDOUBTABLE ENEMY
I DO NOT WISH HIM ANY HARM BUT IT AMUSES ME IMMENSELY TO THINK HOW HE HAS BEEN BEFOOLED
THE DAY AFTER HE HAD CONFIDED THE GOUALEUSE TO THE CARE OF MADAME GEORGES RODOLPH STILL DRESSED AS A MECHANIC WAS AT NOON PRECISELY AT THE DOOR OF A CABARET WITH THE SIGN OF THE PANIER-FLEURI NOT FAR FROM THE BARRIER OF BERCY
YOU ARE A TROUBLE TO ME NOW RODOLPH BEGAN TO BE REALLY TROUBLED HOW TO CONVINCE THE CHOURINEUR AND SAID IN A SOLEMN IMPRESSIVE AND ALMOST SEVERE TONE
DEAD REPLIED RODOLPH
HE HAS PLAYED MORE THAN ONE ABOMINABLE TRICK UPON POOR M
SO PROFOUND IS HIS GRATITUDE FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED TO HIS FATHER THAT ALL BEARING THE HONOURED NAME OF D'HARVILLE OR BELONGING TO THE FAMILY POSSESS A POWERFUL CLAIM ON THE KINDNESS OF THE PRINCE
BUT THE SAP STILL MAINTAINS ITS HOLD IN THE ROOTS AND A THOUSAND GREEN BRANCHES SPRING FRESH FROM WHAT WAS TAKEN FOR A WITHERED AND DEAD TREE
YES I WOULD HAVE STUCK IT INTO THE FELLOW BUT HE DID NOT GIVE ME TIME
I SWEAR TO YOU ON MY HONOUR ALL THIS BELONGS TO YOU
ARE YOU GOING TO JOIN IN THE REBELLION AGAINST SINCERITY MY LORD I AM SO SORRY FOR THE POSITION OF MY UNFORTUNATE VIS-A-VIS THAT--I BEG I MAY DIVIDE HIS PUNISHMENT WITH HIM CHARCOAL-MAN IN ORDINARY YOUR DISINTERESTED FRIENDSHIP DOES YOU HONOUR
PIPELET EXCLAIMED WINKING AT RODOLPH WITH WHAT HE INTENDED SHOULD BE A VERY FACETIOUS AND PENETRATING LOOK I SEE I SEE,--YOU MEAN TO BEGIN MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LODGERS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO WORK YOUR WAY DOWN TO MLLE
THE WHOLE WAS SURROUNDED WITH A WELL-CHOSEN WREATH OF FLOWERS WHOSE GAY COLOURS CONTRASTED AGREEABLY WITH THE SEA-GREEN COLOUR OF THE DOOR
I MAY MEET WITH SOME DECENT SORT OF PEOPLE WHO NOT KNOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE WOULD RECEIVE YOU AS A BOARDER
SITUATED IN A DISTRICT OF MUCH BUSINESS AND DENSE POPULATION THE HOUSE IN QUESTION HAD NOTHING REMARKABLE IN ITS APPEARANCE
SHE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW CLASPING HER HANDS AND CRYING
SPEAK WHY DON'T YOU
WELL THERE WAS MY GENTLEMAN ARRAYED IN ALL HIS FINERY AND SCARCELY CONDESCENDING TO LOOK AT US POOR FOLKS
I CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE HIGH TREES IN THE ALLEE JUST IN FRONT OF YOUR DOOR AND OVER THE DITCH IN WHICH TORTILLARD HAD BEEN STATIONED
THE ONE WAS MURPHY QUITE CURED OF HIS WOUND AND THE OTHER THE CHOURINEUR
BUT HERE AGAIN A DISAPPOINTMENT AWAITED HIM,--THE PISTOL WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND HE COULD BUT CONCLUDE IT HAD FALLEN FROM HIS POCKET DURING HIS STRUGGLE WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER
HAVE I NOT REPAID THOSE SERVICES IN A THOUSAND WAYS IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT RODOLPH HAD NOT ATTACHED TO THESE BITTER WORDS THE HUMILIATING SENSE WHICH COULD PLACE MURPHY IN THE LIGHT OF A MERCENARY
I'LL TELL YOU
UPON QUITTING THE HOUSE RODOLPH BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE FARMYARD WHERE HE FOUND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO THE PRECEDING EVENING DISGUISED AS A CHARCOAL-MAN HAD WARNED HIM OF THE ARRIVAL OF TOM AND SARAH
I FED ON CABBAGE-STUMPS AND OTHER REFUSE VEGETABLES WHICH I PICKED UP WHEN AND WHERE I COULD
I AM GLAD THEY HAVE GONE THAT WAY SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER FOR IF THE COVE RESISTS I HAVE MY OWN IDEA SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TAPIS-FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPENED CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
BUT FROM TIME TO TIME THERE WAS A DEEP AND DULL SILENCE
DAVID
BUT DEAR ME
WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM ME CRIED THE RUFFIAN
IT IS NO USE TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR IT
ALTHOUGH HE HAD APPEARED TO DOTE ON HIS SON SHE WAS YET FULLY CONVINCED THAT THIS FATHER WITH ALL HIS TENDERNESS WOULD NEVER SWERVE FROM CERTAIN PRINCIPLES CERTAIN IDEAS AS TO THE DUTY OF PRINCES AND WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO WHAT HE WOULD CONSIDER A MESALLIANCE FOR HIS SON AND THAT NOT THROUGH PRIDE BUT FROM CONSCIENCE REASON AND DIGNITY
SO IF THROUGH HAVING MY TOES IN THE WATER I GET THE GRENOUILLE_,[7 I AM ALLOWED TO BREAK MY ARMS IN BREAKING UP OLD VESSELS AND UNLOADING TIMBER ON MY BACK
I WISHED TO KNOW IF YOU HAD DISINTERESTEDNESS IN YOUR GENEROSITY AND I FOUND THAT AFTER YOUR COURAGEOUS CONDUCT YOU RETURNED TO YOUR HARD DAILY LABOUR ASKING NOTHING HOPING FOR NOTHING NOT EVEN UTTERING A WORD OF REPROACH FOR THE APPARENT INGRATITUDE WITH WHICH I REPAID YOUR SERVICES
FOR THE FELLOW EITHER THINKS OR FEIGNS TO DO SO THAT HE IS DEEPLY ENGAGED IN STATE AFFAIRS AND VENTURES TO OBSERVE AT TIMES IN A SORT OF UNDERTONE HOW VERY MARVELLOUS IT IS THAT SUCH CLOSE AND INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE FOUND TO EXIST BETWEEN EVERY-DAY EVENTS AND THE DESTINIES OF KINGDOMS
I HAVE DONE SO MUCH WORK LATELY THAT YOUR HAND I TELL YOU,--YOUR HAND OVERCOME BY THIS KIND AND PERSEVERING COMMAND THE CHOURINEUR TIMIDLY EXTENDED HIS BLACK AND HORNY PALM WHICH RODOLPH WARMLY SHOOK
DAVID'S TASTE WAS TOO REFINED TO ALLOW HIM TO BOAST OF HIS HAPPINESS BEFORE THE TIME WHEN HE SHOULD MARRY CECILY WHICH WAS TO BE WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HER SIXTEENTH YEAR
SHE MADE A SIGN TO ONE OF THE LADIES IN WAITING TO COME TO HER AND FROM HER SHE LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY WAS REMARKING THAT THE FIGURE OF MISS SARAH SEYTON OF HALSBURY WAS LESS SLENDER LESS DELICATE IN ITS PROPORTIONS THAN USUAL
THIS PARADISE AS YOU CALL IT IS NO FICTION STOP COACHMAN NOW LOOK
I CAME HERE AND FOUND THIS HOLE AND TAKING AN ARMFUL OF STUFF FROM THE DUNGHILL YONDER I HID MYSELF HERE UP TO MY NOSE AND WAITED FOR THE CHOUETTE
THIS REMINDS ME OF MY BOYISH DAYS AND THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE
ONE TALL AND ERECT HAD HAIR ALMOST WHITE BLACK EYEBROWS AND WHISKERS A LONG AND TANNED FACE WITH A STIFF FORMAL AIR
BUT MORE BECAUSE I AM ALL ON THE FRET TO SEE YOU SERVE OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER
YET THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WICKED ENOUGH TO--BUT NO I WILL NOT TELL YOU
THIS MISSION WHICH HE COULD NOT REFUSE WOULD ONLY DETAIN HIM A FORTNIGHT
YOU WILL FIND IN MY POCKETBOOK NOTES OF ALL THE STEPS TAKEN TO DISCOVER HIS TRACES
THE SCHOOLMASTER'S GLANCE WAS SO QUICK THAT IN SPITE OF THE CALMNESS OF RODOLPH'S FEATURES THE RUFFIAN DETECTED SOME EXPRESSION OF TRIUMPH FOR PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW HE CALLED OUT TO THE DRIVER
RIGOLETTE WHY OF COURSE MONSIEUR
SOME TRIFLING DIFFERENCES HAVE ARISEN BUT NOT OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO CAUSE OR EXPLAIN THE EXTREME DEJECTION OF THE MARQUIS OH THE WOMEN
NOW THAT YOU ARE A BETTER MAN THAN THE CHOURINEUR YOU MAY GO YOUR LENGTH IN THE CITE
A MAN OF THIS FIRM MOULD AND THE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND GOOD IN PROPORTION AS HE IS FIRM AND DETERMINED NEVER ABATES ONE JOT OF THAT WHICH AFFECTS HIS CONSCIENCE HIS REASON AND HIS DIGNITY
BUT IF HE LIVES HE WILL BE IN GOOD HANDS
THE DIVISION IS NOT THIN
THERE ARE PASSERS-BY WHO WILL COME AND HELP US NO AS WE HAVE GOT HIM WE MUST HOLD HIM HERE
A GARLAND OF THE SAME FLOWERS EQUALLY ORNAMENTED WITH PRECIOUS STONES WAS PLACED WITH INFINITE GRACE UPON HER FAIR AND OPEN BROW
WHILE INSTEAD OF ADOPTING THE CLASSICAL AGENCY OF A DEER'S FOOT OR A HARE'S PAD FOR THE HANDLE OF HIS BELL THERE HUNG DANGLING FROM THE CORD THE HAND AND ARM OF A DRIED APE,--THE WITHERED LIMB THE SHRIVELLED HAND WITH ITS FIVE FINGERS EACH SO DISTINCTLY PRESERVED AND THE ARTICULATION OF EVERY JOINT SO CLEARLY DEFINED THE TINY TIPS BEARING THE NAILS LONG AND TAPER AS THOSE OF A HUMAN CREATURE PRESENTED A CLOSE AND HIDEOUS RESEMBLANCE TO THE HAND AND ARM OF A CHILD
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
A YEAR--EIGHTEEN MONTHS--PASSED AWAY
A MONTH HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENTS WE HAVE JUST NARRATED
HE IS A----SCOUNDREL
BUT JUST NOW THE SIGHT OF BLOOD--OF A KNIFE--I COULD NOT BEAR
AH IT IS TIME ALFRED WAS IN FOR DINNER IS QUITE READY AND TRIPE YOU KNOW SHOULD NEVER BE KEPT WAITING
VERY LIKELY
VERY LIKELY
AND THEN MONSEIGNEUR AND I WENT TO THE PLANTER'S HOUSE
AS MUCH TO SPARE THE ALMOST MORBID SENSIBILITY OF MADAME GEORGES AS BECAUSE HE DISLIKES TO BLAZON FORTH HIS GOOD DEEDS MY LORD HAS NOT EVEN ACQUAINTED M
HE WAS SO PLACED THAT HE COULD OBSERVE THE TWO ILL-LOOKING SCOUNDRELS WHO HAD ASKED AFTER GROS-BOITEUX AND THE SCHOOLMASTER
HE WORE A LONG FROCK COAT OF GREEN CLOTH AND A ROUND HAT
I RANG
OH GOD BLESS YOU MY GOOD SIR I THINK WE HAVE INDEED
AH SIR HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DREAM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT THAT YOU WERE BEING HUNTED BY A LEGION OF LITTLE UGLY DEVILS LIKE THESE ON THE DOOR WITH CABRION AT THEIR HEAD URGING THEM ON AND THEN FANCYING YOU ARE TRYING TO GET AWAY AND CANNOT
TO REMOVE ANY AND ALL DOUBT THE COLONIST ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND DESIRED A SLAVE TO BEAR A LANTERN AND CONDUCT US TO DAVID'S CELL WELL WHAT FOLLOWED IN MY LIFE I NEVER SAW SO DISTRESSING A SPECTACLE
SHE WORE A WHITE CRAPE DRESS TRIMMED WITH THE NATURAL FLOWERS OF THE CAMELLIA INTERMIXED WITH ITS OWN RICH GREEN LEAVES
BUT DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME I AM ONLY ALLUDING TO AN IMPOSSIBILITY
YOU MUST PASS THE DAY IN THE HOUSE AND IN THE EVENING YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING WHICH WILL BE WORTH SEEING YOU DID NOT LET OUT MORE THAN THAT BUT I WAS FLY AND SAID TO MYSELF THIS IS A DODGE TO CATCH THE SCHOOLMASTER TO-MORROW BY LAYING A RIGHT BAIT FOR HIM
YOU NEVER HAD A SHELTER UNTIL THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE IMPRISONED AS A VAGABOND
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE CHARCOAL-MAN HE WOULD HAVE DOUBLED UP THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO IS THERE IN THE CORNER WITH THE CHOUETTE
AND IF HE DOES DO NOT LEAVE HER ALONE FOR A MOMENT
HE ALSO KEEPS AN ESTAMINET NEAR THE CHAMPS ELYSEES ALL DOUBT WAS THEN AT AN END,--IT WAS THE BRAS ROUGE OF INFAMOUS NOTORIETY
WORK IMPROVE IT BE ACTIVE VIGILANT AND YOU WILL SOON INCREASE YOUR COMFORT AND THE SECURITY OF THE COLONISTS WHOM YOU WILL AID AND ASSIST I AM SURE FOR YOU WILL ALWAYS BE CHARITABLE AND GENEROUS
THEN ADDRESSING FLEUR-DE-MARIE SHE ADDED COME NOW GOUALEUSE TIP US ONE OF YOUR PRETTY LITTLE DITTIES GOUALANTES SUPPER SUPPER FIRST MOTHER PONISSE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
MUSETTE
AND I WILL SPRING UPON HIM AND HELP YOU FOURLINE CRIED THE CHOUETTE
THE DARKNESS WAS COMPLETE
WELL BUT TO BEGIN
IF YOU PLEASE WE WILL NOT SAY MUCH ON THAT SUBJECT
DO YOU DARE TO INVOKE THE LAW
NEVER MIND YOUR AUNT JUST YET AH HA MR PAINTER
RODOLPH IF YOU PLEASE WE WILL TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE TEARS WILL COME INTO MY EYES WILLINGLY FLEUR-DE-MARIE
THE ARREST
THE LOVELY VOICE OF THE GOUALEUSE HAD MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION ON HER UNKNOWN DEFENDER AND IN SOOTH THAT VOICE SO GENTLE SO DELICIOUSLY MODULATED AND HARMONIOUS HAD AN ATTRACTION SO IRRESISTIBLE THAT THE HORDE OF VILLAINS AND ABANDONED WOMEN IN THE MIDST OF WHOM THIS UNFORTUNATE GIRL LIVED OFTEN BEGGED HER TO SING AND LISTENED TO HER WITH RAPTURE
AND BLOW BLOW BLOW LIKE A SMITH'S FORGE
HIS UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL MUST HAVE SADLY ANNOYED THE DUCHESS DE LUCENAY THOUGH POOR DE LUCENAY IS A VERY INOFFENSIVE CREATURE SAID SARAH WITH AN ILL-NATURED SMILE
I SAW IN AN INSTANT THAT HERS WAS NO DEGRADED SOUL
MERCY BUT YOUR WIFE--YOUR SON--THEY BEAR YOUR NAME MY NAME IS DISHONOURED ALREADY
MURDERER
ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR TO PASS HIS TIME DELIGHTFULLY AND IDLY AMONGST WOMEN AND THE REFINEMENTS OF LUXURY,--TO REPOSE FROM TIME TO TIME FROM THE ANIMATION OF SENSUAL PLEASURES AMIDST THE DELIGHTFUL ATTRACTIONS OF THE FINE ARTS,--TO HUNT OCCASIONALLY NOT AS A NIMROD BUT AS AN INTELLIGENT EPICUREAN AND ENJOY THE TRANSITORY FATIGUES WHICH MAKE IDLENESS AND REPOSE TASTE BUT THE SWEETER,--THIS THIS WAS THE ONLY LIFE WHICH A PRINCE SHOULD THINK OF ENJOYING WHO AND THIS WAS HIS HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS COULD FIND A PRIME MINISTER CAPABLE OF DEVOTING HIMSELF BOLDLY TO THE DISTRESSING AND OVERWHELMING BURDEN OF STATE AFFAIRS
NOW THEN NOW YOU SHALL PAY BOTH FOR LA GOUALEUSE AND YOURSELF HE SHOUTED GRINDING HIS TEETH
SOMETHING WHITE HAD FALLEN ABOUT HALF-WAY DOWN
HE HAS BEEN MY PERSECUTOR ALMOST MY EXECUTIONER,--LONG HAVE I SUFFERED BUT NOW I DESPISE HIM
THE FIRST TIME THE COMMANDANT ARRIVED STRUTTING AND SWELLING LIKE A TURKEY-COCK HUMMING AND SINGING AFTER HIS MANNER ALL THE GAY TUNES OF THE DAY WALKING UP AND DOWN HIS FINE ROOM WITH HIS HANDS STUCK IN HIS POCKETS AND OCCASIONALLY STOPPING TO ARRANGE HIS HAIR BEFORE THE GLASS,--WE WERE WATCHING HIM ALL THE TIME
BUT TELL ME IS IT ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE GO INTO YES QUITE SO M
17 RUE DU TEMPLE A HOUSE RENDERED WORTHY OF OBSERVATION BY THE HABITS AND INGENIOUS PRACTICES OF ITS INHABITANTS
THIS MORNING EARLY I WAS STRUCK WITH THE PALLOR OF HER COUNTENANCE ALTHOUGH HER CHEEKS WERE OF A DEEP ROSE COLOUR
BRAS ROUGE IS GOING TO CLEAR THE HOUSE OF THEM,--WHEN I SAY HAPPILY I DON'T MEAN IT ILL-NATUREDLY IN THE LEAST
ONE HELD THE THIMBLE OF MLLE
HE CURED ME OF A DESPERATE ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM MADAME PIPELET WAS TELLING ME OF THE REPORTS WHICH ARE CIRCULATED OF HIM HOW COULD SHE BE SO FOOLISH NAY PRAY DO NOT FEAR ME
THE SUGGESTION IS WELL WORTHY THE CONSIDERATION OF THE MOST ELEVATED JURISTS FOR THIS PUNISHMENT IS AT THE SAME TIME TERRIBLE AND YET FRUITFUL FOR REPENTANCE
I WOULD RATHER LOSE MY EYESIGHT AT ONCE LIKE THE SCHOOLMASTER THAN BE COMPELLED TO FOLLOW SUCH A BUSINESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEPICT THE ENERGETIC GESTURE ACTION AND COUNTENANCE OF THE CHOURINEUR AS HE THUS EXPRESSED HIMSELF
AT THE END OF THIS VILLAGE STANDS A PRETTY FARM WITH A NICE ORCHARD ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND A GARDEN FILLED WITH FLOWERS ON THE OTHER THAT FARM SHALL BE CALLED MY FARM TO WHICH WE WILL PRETEND WE ARE NOW GOING JUST SO AND WHERE WE KNOW WE SHALL GET SOME DELICIOUS MILK TO DRINK AFTER OUR JOURNEY MILK INDEED
HIS FATHER REASONED THEREON IN THIS STRANGE MANNER
GROPING AGAINST THE SLIMY WALLS HE FELT HIMSELF CONTINUALLY TREADING ON SOME SORT OF ROUND ELASTIC BODIES WHICH APPEARED TO SLIP FROM UNDER HIS FEET AND TO SCRAMBLE FOR SAFETY PAST HIM
HOWEVER BY THIS THREAT MOTHER BURETTE RECEIVED HER TWENTY FRANCS AT THE END OF SEVEN DAYS AND MADAME HERBELOT GOT BACK HER DISAGREEABLE SCREAMING PARROT MOTHER BURETTE HAS NO OTHER WAY OF LIVING BESIDES THE TWO YOU HAVE NAMED I SUPPOSE NOT THAT I KNOW OF
BUT YOUR COMRADE SUPPED HERE WITH THE CHOURINEUR AND GOUALEUSE AND WITH A NOD OF HER HEAD THE OGRESS POINTED OUT THE INDIVIDUAL OF THE PARTY WHO WAS LEFT STILL IN THE CABARET
MY AGE?--LOOK AT MY BEARD
DAVID MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE EYES OF HIS BRUTAL MASTER A COMPLETE LIVING REMORSE SUCH CONDUCT WAS DICTATED ALIKE BY REVENGE AND JEALOUSY
BRADAMANTI DID TO ASSIST THE POOR STARVING BEINGS IN YOUR GARRETS WHY YOU SEE MONSIEUR WHEN I MENTIONED TO M
AND NOW ADIEU TILL THE EVENING MY DEAR MURPHY TILL THE EVENING MY DEAR BARON FARE THEE WELL
NOW--THIS VERY HOUR--YOUR PUNISHMENT SHALL BE PROPORTIONED TO YOUR CRIMES
MAY I LEAD HIM TO SOME SAFE PLACE WHERE AT LEAST HE MAY REMAIN QUIET FOR A TIME NOBLY SAID REPLIED RODOLPH KINDLY PRESSING THE HAND OF THE CHOURINEUR
RODOLPH'S MIND WAS ALREADY INFLAMED WITH AMOROUS IMAGININGS
BUT AS WHAT YOU PROPOSE MAY BE QUITE TRUE AND HONEST AND THE HALF OF SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS WORTH A RISK I AM WILLING TO TRY FOR IT
SHE WAS THEN VERY NEAR HER CONFINEMENT AND YET WAS OBLIGED ALL DAY LONG TO BE WITH HER HANDS AND FEET IN HER WASHING-TUBS
FLEUR-DE-MARIE SPRANG TO THE SIDE OF RODOLPH AND WITH AN AIR OF UNFEIGNED ALARM ALMOST AMOUNTING TO DISTRESS SAID IN A TONE SO LOW AS NOT TO BE OVERHEARD BY MADAME GEORGES
THE WINDOWS OF THE HOTEL WERE BLAZING WITH A THOUSAND LIGHTS WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY THROUGH THE THICK DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WHILE A CROWD OF LACQUEYS IN FULL-DRESS LIVERIES LINED THE ENTRANCE-HALL EXTENDING EVEN TO THE SALONS OF RECEPTION WHERE THE GROOMS OF THE CHAMBER WAITED TO ANNOUNCE THE DIFFERENT ARRIVALS
BECAUSE YOU RELISH THE HARLEQUIN WHY MAY BE SO
HE DESIRES ALSO THAT YOU SEND OFF THIS MORNING THESE DESPATCHES BY A SPECIAL COURIER INSTEAD OF WAITING TILL MONDAY
I CAME OUT FROM THE PILE OF WOOD AND SAW A GENTLEMAN AND A MAN IN A BLOUSE
AND FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS WILL SUFFICE DAVID AMPLY MY LORD MY GOOD FELLOW SAID RODOLPH TO THE BEWILDERED CHOURINEUR I HAVE TWO WORDS TO SAY TO M
THE SHOP IS SHUT UP
AND WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY TO HIM WHEN I SAY THEY DRANK I MAKE A MISTAKE
THE CHOKED AIR BEGAN TOO TO FAIL IN THE NARROW SPACE NOW LEFT IT AND THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF ASPHYXIA BEGAN TO OPPRESS RODOLPH
MURPHY OPENS THE DOOR AND THE ONE-EYED MOTHER OF MISCHIEF TOSSES UP HER ARMS AND MAKES HER WAY INTO THE GARDEN
THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN MISERY,--BITTER BITTER MISERY
HIS RED BEARD WAS LONG AND MATTED IN DISORDER
TOM CRIBB TAUGHT YOU TO BOX
THANKS TO MY HAVING DONE THESE THINGS AND THE CUNNING OF MY ADVOCATE MY SENTENCE WAS CHANGED AND INSTEAD OF BEING SCRAGGED I WAS ONLY SENT TO THE HULKS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
WHICH I SHALL NEVER MORE BEHOLD
NOW I AM SAFE PRAY LET HIM GO
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I AM ONLY A POOR DEVIL OF A WORKMAN ALTHOUGH YOU SAY THEY OFFER TWO THOUSAND FRANCS FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE AGAINST ME
NARCISSE
NARCISSE
IF YOU ARE A PRIG I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU
HE FOUND HIMSELF EXTENDED ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THICK DARKNESS
IS IT POSSIBLE SHE CRIED CLASPING HER HANDS IN ASTONISHMENT
AND ALTHOUGH WHEN IN PRIVATE HE WAS VERY PRECISE IN MY-LORDING RODOLPH YET BEFORE STRANGERS HE WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO ADDRESS HIM OTHERWISE THAN AS M
AN ARMFUL OF STRAW--AN APOLOGY FOR A CARPET--WAS PLACED AT THE FOOT OF THE OGRESS'S COUNTER WHICH WAS AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE DOOR JUST BENEATH THE DIM LANTERN
HER SOBS ALMOST CHOKED HER
IN HIS MODE OF LIVING HE OBSERVES A PARSIMONY BORDERING ON AVARICE
THE ADDRESS OF THE LATTER IS RUE DU SENTIER NO
WE WILL FINISH THIS BODILY PICTURE OF RODOLPH BY SAYING THAT HIS FEATURES REGULARLY HANDSOME SEEMED TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR A MAN
IT WAS A POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF OF THE FINEST CAMBRIC TRIMMED WITH COSTLY LACE AND BEARING IN ONE CORNER THE INITIALS L
I DON'T KNOW SIR
THE OGRESS WAS AIRING HERSELF AT HER DOOR WHEN RODOLPH PRESENTED HIMSELF
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I CANNOT ANSWER YOU BEFORE I HAVE EXAMINED IT ALL MYSELF,--THAT IS BY THE AID OF MY WIFE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME QUITE AND THIS EVENING AT TEN O'CLOCK MEET ME AT THE CORNER OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AND I WILL TELL YOU MORE IF IT IS A TRAP LOOK OUT
IT IS JUST TWELVE RAINS AND BLOWS LIKE THE DEVIL
MINOR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS OF SINGLE WORDS OTHERWISE SPELLED CORRECTLY THROUGHOUT THE TEXT HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT COMMENT
RODOLPH PICKED IT UP AND CARRIED IT TO ONE OF THE NARROW WINDOWS WHICH LIGHTED THE STAIRCASE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD RETURNED FOAMING WITH RAGE TWO PERSONS APPROACHING FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THAT BY WHICH RODOLPH HAD DISAPPEARED ENTERED INTO THE TAPIS-FRANC HASTILY AND OUT OF BREATH AS IF THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING FAR AND FAST
THE MATTER
THE MATTER
THAT CUCKOO-NOTE OF FALSE PRAISE BELONGS TO BIRDS OF SUCH FEATHER AS THEMSELVES AND THE SPECIES THEY CLAIM RELATIONSHIP WITH
I AM HERE IN THE ENTRANCE TO YOUR KEN AND YOU IT MUST BE TIS NOT BRAS ROUGE SAID THE VOICE
AND THEY DO KEEP MOST EXCELLENT HERE AT HAND
MURPHY WHILST WE STILL STRUGGLED DESPERATELY WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER
FOR THOSE WHO SPORT WITH THE KNIFE THE HEADSMAN'S STEEL IS THE PROPER FATE
CABRION ON THE SECOND DOOR HAD BEEN SCRUPULOUSLY RESPECTED BY M
AND THUS I ACCOUNT FOR WHY IT IS THAT WOMAN ALL LOVELY AS SHE IS NEVER LOOKS SO MUCH SO AS WHEN SEEN BENEATH YOUR ROOF
AND IF THE TRUTH MUST BE SAID THERE IS NOT A TIDIER NOR MORE NICER GIRL THAN YOU IN ALL THE CITE
WE CAN NO LONGER DOUBT BUT THAT THE MONSTER MET HIS DEATH IN THE ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE FROM THE RODOLPH HESITATED TO PRONOUNCE THE HORRIBLE WORD
PRESS IN THE BOTTOM USE YOUR STEEL FILE A PUSH SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER AND IT IS OPEN THE CHOUETTE CONTINUED
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL OFF TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF M
THE LAW EXCLAIMED RODOLPH
IT HAS ALMOST BECOME A TORRENT
WERE IT TO BLAME INSTEAD OF COMMEND HE WOULD OBSERVE LESS HASTE NOTHING NEW HAS TRANSPIRED WITH US MY DEAR BARON,--NOTHING AT ALL
BUT THERE IS ONE PART WHICH YOU MUST ALTER OH CHOURINEUR DO NOT GET YOURSELF INTO ANY QUARREL ON MY ACCOUNT
CECILY WAS IN LOVE AND WITH DAVID WHO DURING THE LATE FEARFUL DISTEMPER HAD ATTENDED HER WITH THE MOST VIGILANT CARE
ARE YOU SORRY FOR THE GIRL AND HER MISERIES
YOU ARE BOLD AS A LION WITH MUSCLES LIKE IRON AND THOUGH SO SLIGHT IN FORM I SHOULD HAVE NO MORE CHANCE WITH YOU THAN A DRAY-HORSE WOULD AGAINST A RACER WERE THEY TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER
DAVID ONLY COULD SAVE THE COLONIST BUT WILLIS DISTRUSTFUL AS ALL EVIL-DOERS ARE IMAGINED THAT THE BLACK WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF BY ADMINISTERING POISON
AND THEN WHEN I COULD SING I SEEMED NO LONGER TO BE A PRISONER
IN SOOTH TWO WORDS BUT TWO MAGIC WORDS FOR THE HEART THAT UNDERSTOOD THEM HAD ALMOST SUDDENLY DEVELOPED THE GENEROUS INSTINCTS WHICH WERE INHERENT IN THIS ENERGETIC NATURE
FROM HENCE WE MAY GO TO A THOUSAND DIFFERENT PLACES
BUT QUICK QUICK CRIED THE CHOURINEUR DOWN THERE I SEE THE HEAD OF THE CHOUETTE
WELL THEN IF IT IS NOT A FRIEND WHY HERE GOES AT YOU EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR
BUT THE PRINCE FEIGNED NOT TO OBSERVE THEIR PRESENCE
I HAVE A BETTER PLAN FOR AVENGING THE CHOUETTE'S BRUTALITIES TO GOUALEUSE WHICH I WILL TELL YOU HEREAFTER
AMONGST FRIENDS THERE SHOULD BE NO CEREMONY I KNOW THEM WELL AND I TELL YOU THAT WE MUST NOT THINK OF GOING BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR SENSES YOUNG MAN I GIVE YOU MY OPINION AND DEVIL FETCH ME IF I STIR FROM HERE BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF,--I NEVER CLOSE MY ESTABLISHMENT BEFORE MIDNIGHT SAID BRAS ROUGE IN HIS FALSETTO VOICE
AND THE VERY NEXT DAY THE UPHOLSTERER-MAN SIGNED THE LEASE WITH M
AND GOLDEN SPECTACLES UPON THE HORNY BRIDGE OF HIS SHARP PROJECTING NOSE
YOU KNOW THE REST
HER FRIEND M
WHEN I SAY NO ONE I DO NOT MEAN OUR COMRADE RODOLPH
BUT TELL ME HOW YOU PROVE YOUR ASSERTION WHY JUST SO MY LORD
AND YET IT SEEMED AS IF EVERY ONE OF THOSE WHOM I KILLED WAS MY BROTHER AND I LOVED ALL OF THEM
HOW UNFORTUNATE SAID ONE OF THEM
WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE
AND I OUGHT NOT TO BLUSH AT THAT OF WHICH I AM ON THE CONTRARY SO PROUD AND WOULD DESIRE OPENLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXPECTATION OF POSTERITY HAD REDOUBLED RODOLPH'S TENDERNESS FOR SARAH AND PLACED BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO ACCEDE TO HER WISHES AND THE DREAD OF HIS FATHER'S WRATH HE EXPERIENCED THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
NONSENSE
INDEED HE IS SO BOISTEROUS THAT THE BARE IDEA OF HIM MAKES ONE THINK OF PRETENDING TO FAINT OR ANY OTHER PRETEXT TO AVOID HIM
I HAD NOT BEGGED A FARTHING AND THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE FRIGHTENED DID I BECOME
AND MY COMRADE HAVING COME TO MAKE SURE OF HIS MEN WHY WE HAVE MADE FREE TO TAKE THEM HOW LUCKY THEY PAID ME BEFOREHAND FOR THEIR PINT SAID THE OGRESS
RODOLPH IT SURPRISES YOU THAT AFTER MY UNHAPPY LIFE I CAN FEEL ANY CONCERN AS TO WHAT BECOMES OF MY MISERABLE REMAINS
I CAN SEW VERY WELL I HAVE GOOD COURAGE AND THOUGHT THAT I HAD ONLY TO ASK FOR WORK AND GET IT
RODOLPH ASKED M
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE KEPT A WINE-SHOP ALSO AND AMONGST OTHER DRINKERS A CHARCOAL-MAN WITH HIS FACE BLACKENED AND HIS LARGE HAT FLAPPING OVER HIS EYES WAS PAYING HIS SHOT AT THE BAR WHEN THESE THREE PERSONAGES APPEARED
TO-MORROW I WILL SEND IN MY FURNITURE
AND YET I WAS HORRIBLY WRETCHED
BUT NOT AT THE FIRST PULL
IN THIS EXTREMITY SHE BOLDLY PROPOSED TO THE YOUNG PRINCE TO TELL ALL TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS AS WELL AS THE DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS FONDER THAN EVER OF HER
BESIDES WHEN I SAY HAPPY WHY WHAT YESTERDAY YOU CAME TO SEEK FOR ME AT THE PORT ST NICOLAS WHERE I WAS UNLOADING AS HARD AS I COULD TO KEEP MYSELF WARM
A MURDER WOULD HAVE STAINED THE TAPIS-FRANC NO DOUBT IF THE CHOUETTE TAKING THE SCHOOLMASTER BY THE ARM HAD NOT SCREAMED OUT
MON DIEU AND HOW DO YOU MEAN BE GOOD
LE COMTE THAT IN MY MEMORY THE PAST NEVER DIES
WHY SHOULD HE DEMORALISE THE UNHAPPY CHILD
WHO LIVES ON THE FIRST FLOOR THEN THE OLD WOMAN PLACED HER YELLOW SHRIVELLED FINGER UPON HER PENDULOUS LIP AND REPLIED BY A HALF-MALICIOUS GRIN
THEIR FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO LOOK AROUND THE ROOM
MURPHY
MURPHY
MURPHY
MURPHY
MURPHY
MURPHY
CERTAINLY LA CHOUETTE IS UNCOMMONLY ODD
FIVE OR SIX ENORMOUS CLUMPS OF TREES AND INDIAN OR OTHER TROPICAL SHRUBS PLANTED IN IMMENSE CASES FILLED WITH PEAT EARTH WERE SURROUNDED BY ALLEYS PAVED WITH A MOSAIC SHELL-WORK AND SUFFICIENTLY WIDE FOR TWO OR THREE PERSONS TO WALK ABREAST
AND THEN SAID TO HIMSELF HAS MURPHY THEN BEEN THE DUPE OF THIS CURSED OLD HAG
IT HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN THAT RODOLPH AFTER HAVING VISITED THE HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE HAD RETURNED HOME AND INTENDED IN THE EVENING TO BE PRESENT AT A BALL GIVEN BY THE
YOU SHALL DRINK AS DEEP OF THE SHAME OF THE SON AS YOU HAVE OF THE DISGRACE OF THE FATHER ALAS
THAT IS THEY WERE NOT ALONE ADDED THE BRIGAND IN A VOICE OF TERROR
RODOLPH FOLLOWED THE PORTER INTO A TOLERABLY GOOD-SIZED ROOM ACCESSIBLE BY A SMALL ENTRANCE-CLOSET OR ANTECHAMBER HAVING TWO WINDOWS OPENING INTO THE RUE DU TEMPLE
I BEGGED THE PORTER TO ALLOW ME TO SIT DOWN ON THE STEP OF THE DOOR AND HE VERY KINDLY ASKED ME TO STEP IN OFFERING ME A GLASS OF WINE AND WATER
HOPE RECALLED HIS EXPIRING STRENGTH AND MAKING ONE POWERFUL EFFORT RODOLPH WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE FOLLOWING WORDS AFTER WHICH ALL CONSCIOUSNESS FORSOOK HIM
STALLS OF CHARCOAL-SELLERS FRUIT-SELLERS OR VENDERS OF REFUSE MEAT OCCUPIED THE GROUND FLOOR OF SOME OF THESE WRETCHED ABODES
BLIND
BLIND
NO BLUNDER NOW
PIPELET AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF MY GOING TO-MORROW AS A NEW NEIGHBOUR OF MOREL'S TO INQUIRE WHETHER I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE TO THEM
WILL THEY HAVE SOON COMPLETED THEIR RESPECTIVE MISSIONS YOU KNOW THAT MONSEIGNEUR WILL KEEP THEM AWAY AS LONG AS POSSIBLE THAT HE MAY ENJOY MORE SOLITUDE AND LIBERTY
THINKING HIS HOUR WAS COME HE TREMBLED AND CRIED MERCY NO MERCY FOR YOU SAID RODOLPH
AND HIS BOOTS CLEANED VERY BRIGHTLY AND REPLACING THE HEAVY IRON SHOES OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING SHOWED OFF TO ADVANTAGE A WELL-FORMED FOOT WHICH SEEMED ALL THE SMALLER FROM APPEARING OUT OF A LOOSE PANTALOON OF OLIVE VELVETEEN
RODOLPH WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT AND SATISFIED WITH THE HORRIBLE EFFECT WHICH THE SIGHT OF THE BLOOD HAD CAUSED TO HIS PROTEGE
THESE MEN TORTURE THEIR SLAVES AND YET DO NOT TAKE ANY PRECAUTION AGAINST THEM BUT SLEEP WITH DOORS AND WINDOWS OPEN
IN A SHORT TIME I SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONCEAL MY SITUATION
MY LIFE
THE LOOK THE WORDS FULLY ENLIGHTENED RODOLPH AS TO THE CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS AND WISHING TO DISSIPATE IT HE SAID SMILINGLY
BUT THE NIGHT WAS TOO DARK AND THE BEAMS OF THE STREET-LAMP TOO FLICKERING AND FEEBLE
WELL THEN I TOOK THE BUNDLE UNDER MY ARM AND PASSING A LOW DAMP GARDEN SURROUNDED BY A LITTLE WALL I THREW THE BRAT TORTILLARD INTO THE MIDST OF A CABBAGE-BED
NOR COULD A MORE INGENIOUS IDEA HAVE BEEN RESORTED TO THAN IN THE HAPPY AMALGAMATION OF THESE TWO COLOURS BY WHICH A CHARMING AND ALMOST UNEARTHLY LIGHT WAS PRODUCED COMBINING THE CLEAR CERULEAN BLUE OF A SUMMER'S NIGHT WITH THE ROSE-COLOURED CORUSCATIONS EMITTED FROM SPARKLING RAYS OF AN AURORA BOREALIS
TO HAVE EVERY DAY MY HANDS AND FEET IN BLOOD TO CUT THE THROATS OF POOR ANIMALS WHO DO NOT SO MUCH AS MAKE A STRUGGLE--OH NO NO
HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE WORTHY SQUIRE HAD NOT QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE FULL MEANING OF HIS NOTE NECESSARILY SO LACONIC AND CONTAINING ONLY THESE WORDS
THE TAPIS-FRANC 11 II
AH SIR IT IS REALLY AN IMPOSITION,--I CANNOT ALLOW IT EXCLAIMED THE SCHOOLMASTER
EXCELLENT CREAM AND NEWLY LAID EGGS IF YOU PLEASE AND WHERE WE WOULD BE GLAD TO STAY ALL OUR LIVES ALL OUR LIVES
LITTLE BY LITTLE I SOLD MY SMALL STOCK OF CLOTHES AND LINEN AND WHEN ALL WAS GONE THEY TURNED ME OUT OF MY LODGING
WITH THAT SUM YOU COULD EASILY PLACE YOURSELF TO BOARD WITH SOME QUIET GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOOK TO YOU,--IN SOME RETIRED SPOT IN THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU MIGHT PASS YOUR DAYS HAPPILY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT WHILST THE HORSE JUST RECOVERS HIS WIND I REALLY SHOULD FOR IT REMINDS ME OF MY BOYISH DAYS IF IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD MONTFAUCON FOR A SLAUGHTER-HOUSE AND BROKEN-DOWN HORSES FOR CATTLE
WHAT THEN WOULD YOU HAVE COME TO-MORROW TO THE PLAIN OF ST DENIS
NOT SHE
RODOLPH SAID THE CHOURINEUR YOU MAY BOAST THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A STOUT FRIEND AND A GOOD FELLOW
A HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE 258 XXIV
I DO NOT GRUMBLE IN THE LEAST
WELL THEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE,--SOMETIMES YOU WANT A LIGHT SOMETIMES A FEW LIVE COALS TO KINDLE UP YOUR FIRE MAYBE A LITTLE WATER,--FOR ONE IS SURE ALWAYS TO FIND PLENTY OF FRESH SPRING WATER AT MLLE
AND WHEN HE IS FULLY DECORATED SCREWED IN UNIFORMED GOLD-LACED PLUMED ETC ETC IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A MORE GLORIOUS SELF-SATISFIED PROUD HANDSOME--ANIMAL TRUE BUT IT IS HIS VERY GOOD LOOKS THAT PREVENT HIM FROM HAVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN OF REFINED AND ACUTE INTELLECT WELL
THE CHOURINEUR FELT AN INDESCRIBABLE FEAR
AH HERE IS THE DARLING ONE MOME SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
THEN YOU MUST KNOW THAT HE IS A REGULAR MONEY-GRUBBING OLD USURER
AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION RODOLPH REPLIED
I HAVE BUT ONE EYE BUT THAT IS A GOOD ONE DO YOU SEE YOUNG MAN,--DO YOU SEE SHE IS ALL IMPATIENCE TO BE AT WORK IF SHE MANAGES CLEVERLY TO GET INTO THE HOUSE I DO NOT THINK YOUR IDEA A BAD ONE TAKE THE UMBRELLA FOURLINE
OF COURSE THE PERSON TENANTING THIS FARM IS YOUR AUNT OF COURSE SHE IS MY AUNT AND A VERY GOOD SENSIBLE KIND WOMAN M
YOU REALLY OVERWHELM ME REPLIED RODOLPH WITH AN IRONICAL SMILE WHILE THE BARON GLANCED AT MURPHY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A MAN WHO HAS JUST DISCOVERED HE HAS BEEN SAYING A FOOLISH THING
YOU HAVE PRAISED MY UNDERSTANDING,--I WILL IN RETURN ADMIRE YOUR COUNTENANCE
CERTAIN THAT THE COACH WAS NOT FOLLOWED HE HAD BECOME MORE ASSURED AND DESIROUS OF IMITATING THE CHOUETTE WHO SLEPT OR RATHER PRETENDED TO SLEEP HE SAID TO RODOLPH
HIS EYES STARING WITH SELF-SATISFIED ADMIRATION AT HIMSELF AND THE CERTAINTY OF NOT BEING DISAPPOINTED THIS TIME
WELL IT SEEMS THIS GOUBIN'S WIFE TOOK HER TO THE CELLAR WHERE SHE WAS HIDING,--IT WAS JUST A SHELTER AND NO MORE
THE AIM OF TOURNEMINE IN ADDRESSING THESE PARTICULARS TO BRAS ROUGE WAS TO ENABLE THE LATTER TO EXTORT MONEY FROM MADAME SERAPHIN WHOM TOURNEMINE CONSIDERED BUT AS THE AGENT OF A THIRD PARTY UNDER A THREAT OF REVEALING THE WHOLE AFFAIR UNLESS WELL PAID FOR SILENCE
BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR POSITION THEY COULD NOT SEE THAT THEY WERE THE OBJECTS OF SUCH MARKED AND CONSTANT ATTENTION
HAD I HAD MILLIONS I COULD HAVE PAID THEM TO HAVE ENJOYED MY TRADE IT IS THAT WHICH HAS GIVEN YOU THE HABIT OF STABBING SAID RODOLPH
AT THIS MOMENT MY LEFT HAND WAS SEIZED WITH THE CRAMP AND I WAS COMPELLED TO LOOSEN MY HOLD
IT WOULD SEEM AS THOUGH THE NATURAL PERVERSITY OF THIS ABANDONED WOMAN HAVING TILL THEN SLUMBERED WAS SUDDENLY AWAKENED AND DEVELOPED ITSELF WITH FEARFUL ENERGY
MY MASTER DOES NOT LIVE IN THIS QUARTER AND WE SHALL FIND A COACH ON THE QUAI AUX FLEURS AS YOU PLEASE M
AND WHAT SHALL YOU CHARGE TWENTY FRANCS A MONTH COMMANDANT TWENTY FRANCS EXCLAIMED THE COMMANDANT
I WAS SO HUNGRY THAT I TRIED TO GNAW A PIECE OF THE BARK BUT I COULD NOT BITE IT,--IT WAS TOO HARD
AS THE ELEVENTH HOUR OF THE NIGHT SOUNDED FROM THE DIFFERENT CLOCKS IN PARIS THE GATES OF AN HOTEL IN THE RUE PLUMET WERE THROWN OPEN BY A SWISS IN RICH LIVERY AND FORTHWITH ISSUED A MAGNIFICENT DARK BLUE BERLIN CARRIAGE DRAWN BY TWO SUPERB LONG-TAILED GRAY HORSES
AND NOW TELL ME WHY DO YOU LOOK SO BESEECHINGLY AT ME WITH THOSE LARGE TEARFUL EYES
THE DEPARTURE
HE HAS HOWEVER RETAINED VERY ACCURATE RECOLLECTIONS TOUCHING THE FORTUNES AND SITUATIONS OF HIS OLD CLIENTS
HE STUNNED ME WITH TWO BLOWS OF HIS FISTS AND UPSET ME ON THE TABLE,--FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT ANY MAN EVER DID SO
WHAT DO YOU THINK
BEGGARS WHO DON'T LIKE THIEVING WOULD FIND IT GREATLY TO THEIR ADVANTAGE YOU WERE COLD THIRSTY HUNGRY CHOURINEUR AND YET YOU DID NOT STEAL NO
YES IT WAS AT THE WHITE RABBIT THAT HE WAS TO GIVE US THE MEETING THERE ARE NOT TWO WHITE RABBITS IN THIS STREET SAID THE OGRESS WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD
AND THE ODD THINGS SHE HAS BROUGHT HER AS PLEDGES YOU WOULD SCARCELY BELIEVE
I WENT WITH THEM SO EXHAUSTED FOR WANT OF FOOD THAT MY SENSES WERE GONE
THE ENTRANCE TO THIS IMMENSE HOTHOUSE WAS FROM A LONG GALLERY GLITTERING WITH GOLD WITH MIRRORS CRYSTAL VASES FILLED WITH THE CHOICEST PERFUMES AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND ALSO RAISED A FEW STEPS ABOVE THE FAIRY PALACE WE HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING TO DESCRIBE
BUT I HAVE TAKEN EVERY CARE ON YOU EVER SINCE YOU CAME HERE SIX WEEKS AGO
RODOLPH WISHED TO GO LAST OUT OF POLITENESS TO THE CHOUETTE BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER WOULD NOT ALLOW IT AND FOLLOWED CLOSE ON HIS HEELS WATCHING HIS EVERY MOVEMENT
I WORK BY THE PIECE RESPONDED RODOLPH
YOU KNOW HIM AND IF YOU THINK HE WOULD REFUSE ME WHY SPARE ME THE REFUSAL AND I WILL GO AS I CAME COME ALONG WITH ME SAID MURPHY
HE ASSURED THE MISLED BOY WHO LISTENED TO HIM WITH A FATAL EARNESTNESS THAT PLEASURES HOWEVER EXCESSIVE FAR FROM DEMORALISING A HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED PRINCE OFTEN MADE HIM MERCIFUL AND GENEROUS INASMUCH AS FINE MINDS ARE NEVER MORE PREDISPOSED TO BENEVOLENCE AND CLEMENCY THAN WHEN ACTED UPON BY THEIR OWN ENJOYMENTS
HAVING LAID THE BACK ON THE GROUND HE PROCEEDED AFTER ALL MANNER OF DELICATE ARRANGEMENTS TO TAKE HIS SEAT ON THE OUTER RAILS
RODOLPH HAD THEN FRESH MOTIVES FOR PERSEVERING IN HIS PROJECTS AND FORTUNATELY HIS ABSENCE OF MIND WAS NOT OBSERVED BY THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO WAS BUSY HELPING THE CHOUETTE
YET NO ONE PITIES ME,--NO ONE CARES FOR ME,--NO HAND IS STRETCHED OUT TO HELP THE WRETCHED BLIND UPON HIS LONELY WAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THE STUPEFACTION AND ALARM EXPRESSED BY THE COUNTENANCE OF THE CHOURINEUR DURING THIS TERRIBLE SCENE
WELL IF HE BE THE WEAKER WHY HE GETS THE WORST OF IT
THE FEELING OF THE TIME WAS NOT WARLIKE
AND NOW WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
I THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH SIR FOR INDEED I FEAR THAT WITHOUT YOUR AID HE WOULD HAVE BEATEN ME THE UNKNOWN INSTEAD OF REPLYING LISTENED WITH MUCH ATTENTION TO THE VOICE OF THIS GIRL
YOU KNOW THE REST AND ALL THE SCANDAL OF THE ADVENTURES THAT FOLLOWED
I ACCUSED MYSELF OF BEING A WANDERER AND THEY SENT ME TO PRISON
AND MOREL THAT IS THE NAME OF THE WORKMAN WITH THE SICK FAMILY WAS SURE TO BE INVITED TO SHARE IT WITH HIM
COME DON'T LET US BEAR MALICE BEAR MALICE
WOMEN WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER UNDER THE VAULTED ARCHES DEEP AND DARK LIKE CAVERNS
GERMAIN WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE AMONG THEM BY REASON OF HIS KIND AND AMIABLE DISPOSITION AS WELL AS FOR THE FRANK GAIETY OF HIS TEMPER
HE DOES NOT CRY OUT,--ALL IS SO SILENT
OH WHAT WOULD I NOT GIVE TO LIVE THERE
OTHERWISE HE ADDED WITH PERFECT SINCERITY HE AND HIS SISTER WOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE GEROLSTEIN
HE SAYS THAT HIS MASTER IS GOING TO BUY HIMSELF A HORSE AND A RED COAT AND TO SELL HIS DRUGS IN THE MARKET-PLACES AND THAT YOUNG TORTILLARD IS TO BE DRESSED LIKE A PAGE AND BE AT THE DRUM TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS THIS SEEMS TO ME A VERY HUMBLE OCCUPATION FOR THE SON OF YOUR PRINCIPAL LESSEE WHY HIS FATHER SAYS UNLESS HE GETS A PRETTY STRONG HAND OVER HIM AND A TOLERABLY POWERFUL TASTE OF WHIPCORD IN THE WAY OF A SOUND THRASHING EVERY NOW AND THEN HE IS SAFE TO COME TO THE SCAFFOLD
I BEGAN THEN TO SNOOZE BUT I HAD NOT BEEN LONG ASLEEP I THINK WHEN AROUSED BY A NOISE I SAT UP AND LISTENED
THE SCHOOLMASTER STOOD ON HIS GUARD HIS TWO HANDS IN FRONT HIS CHEST ADVANCED FIRMLY PLANTED ON HIS LEGS AND ARCHED AS IT WERE ON HIS BRAWNY LEGS WHICH WERE LIKE BALUSTERS OF STONE
WHAT A FINE VOICE HE HAS
AND DOES NO ONE AFFORD THEM ANY ASSISTANCE TRULY SIR WE DO ALL WE CAN
HE HAD THREE WAYS BEFORE HIM,--TO INFORM THE GRAND DUKE OF THE MATRIMONIAL PROJECT TO OPEN RODOLPH'S EYES AS TO THE MANOEUVRES OF TOM AND SARAH TO LEND HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE
IN THE MEANWHILE HE CONSOLED THESE POOR PEOPLE AND EXHORTED THEM TO PATIENCE
17 THERE IS A HOUSE INHABITED BY A RICH MAN WHOSE NAME IS I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE INDISCRETION OF ASKING HIS NAME
GERMAIN WHO HAD NOT A FRANC MORE THAN HE KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH USED TO PRETEND FROM TIME TO TIME THAT HE HAD RECEIVED A PRESENT OF A FEW BOTTLES OF WINE FROM HIS FRIENDS
AND AS HE IS TWICE AS STRONG AS YOU AND I THEY WILL HAVE A TOUGH JOB WHO TAKE HIM WHAT DID YOU DO CHOURINEUR WHEN YOU LEFT THE BAGNE I OFFERED MYSELF TO THE MASTER-LIGHTERMAN OF THE QUAI ST PAUL AND I GET MY LIVELIHOOD THERE BUT AS YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN A PRIG WHY DO YOU LIVE IN THE CITE WHY WHERE ELSE CAN I LIVE
WHY PORTER YOU ARE JESTING SURELY AND HEREUPON HE BEGAN BATING ALFRED DOWN IN THE MOST SHABBY MANNER TRYING TO SQUEEZE POOR PEOPLE LIKE US OUT OF TWO OR THREE MISERABLE FRANCS WHEN HE HAD BEEN SQUANDERING THOUSANDS IN FITTING UP HIS GRAND APARTMENTS WHICH AFTER ALL HE DID NOT MEAN TO LIVE IN
RODOLPH SHE AT LENGTH EXCLAIMED WITH A BEWILDERED LOOK HOW CAN THIS BE
HAVING FULFILLED HIS TASK TO ADMIRATION THE SQUIRE CALLED TO ENGLAND ON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS LEFT GERMANY FOR SOME TIME TO THE GREAT REGRET OF RODOLPH WHO LOVED HIM EXTREMELY
GOOD FINETTE ADDED THE ROBBER EXTENDING HIS HAND TO THE HORRID HAG
HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THAT
IT WAS ENOUGH TO WORRY ONE OUT OF ONE'S SENSES
HER BODY WAS GIVEN TO THE SURGEONS FOR DISSECTION MURMURED THE SHUDDERING FLEUR-DE-MARIE
BUT I CONJURE YOU IF A CONSULTATION BE NECESSARY MY LORD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY FIRST THOUGHT HAD I SEEN THE SLIGHTEST REASON FOR SUCH A STEP
I'FAITH I DON'T KNOW AND I THINK I ONLY AWOKE AT THE END OF THE AFFAIR FOR THE TALL MAN WAS TALKING OF GETTING BACK HIS POCKETBOOK WHICH THE CHOUETTE WAS TO BRING HERE IN EXCHANGE FOR FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
HE ONLY WISHED THAT THE TEMPLE AND THE PRIEST WERE AT HAND THAT HE MIGHT MARRY HER THAT INSTANT
CHAPTER V
THE NEXT TIME BEFORE HE CAME HIMSELF A SMALL NOTE WAS BROUGHT HERE BY A MAN DIRECTED TO M
THEN HE ADDED DAVID A WORD AND HE WHISPERED SOMETHING IN THE EAR OF THE BLACK
SO AS I SAY THERE IS NO BLAME TO MLLE
AND I HAD A SHOWER OF THUMPS AND NO BREAD
I FORGET SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME AND WILL NOT GUESS HOW UNWORTHY I AM AND POOR FLEUR-DE-MARIE TRIED TO SUPPRESS THE DEEP SIGH THAT WOULD ACCOMPANY HER WORDS
I LEANED AGAINST THE LOCK AS THOUGH ACCIDENTALLY AND HERE IS THE IMPRESSION
BUT LET YOU ONCE GET INTO THAT GOOD PERE JOSEPH'S SHOP AND IT IS HARD WORK TO GET OUT AGAIN
BUT FOR A PERSON OF YOUR MIND AND GOOD TASTE TO DESCEND TO ITS USAGE--OH FIE
COME COME IF OUR SEARCH HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL SO FAR YET ONE DAY PERHAPS MADAME GEORGES SHOOK HER HEAD SORROWFULLY AND SAID IN BITTER ACCENTS MY POOR SON WOULD BE NOW TWENTY YEARS OLD SAY HE IS THAT AGE GOD HEAR YOU AND GRANT IT M
SO MUCH THE BETTER,--SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND I ASSURE YOU MY DEAR MURPHY THAT M
I WOULD RATHER BE REFUSED AT FIRST THAN DETECTED AFTERWARDS
THE OGRESS
MARK THOSE WORDS,--'IT WILL BE TAKEN FROM ME SEE HOW THEY FILL YOU WITH FEAR AND DREAD
NOW THEY ARE SETTLING ON THAT OLD MILL
WOULD YOU BUT GENEROUSLY SAVE ME FROM THE HANDS OF JUSTICE I WOULD PROMISE YOU MOST SOLEMNLY TO FORSAKE ALL SUCH EVIL PRACTICES FOR THE FUTURE BE SATISFIED YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
IT IS AS PRECISE AS IF WE SAW IT SAID RODOLPH
AFTER HER SCRUTINY SHE SAID IN A TONE OF COARSE SATISFACTION IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE--SO IT IS--TO LEND ONE'S GOOD CLOTHES TO YOU
I HAD HAIR MUCH MORE FLAXEN THAN NOW AND THE BLOOD WAS ALWAYS IN MY EYES AND SO THEY CALLED ME THE ALBINO THE ALBINOS ARE THE WHITE RABBITS AMONGST MEN
THE COOKERY AT THE WHITE RABBIT IS FIRST-RATE THE THREE PERSONAGES THEN IN PERFECT AMITY BENT THEIR STEPS TOGETHER TOWARDS THE TAVERN
NOTHING COULD HAVE SUITED ME BETTER
IF THEY ONLY KNEW--AND THAT LITTLE OLD MAN OF THE RUE DU ROULE--AND THAT WOMAN OF THE CANAL ST MARTIN--BUT IT IS USELESS THINKING OF ALL THOSE THINGS NOW
KARL LOST ALL TRACE OF RODOLPH AT THE ENTRANCE OF THESE OBSCURE STREETS
WHEN I SAW THE TRAPS WALK IN I SAYS TO MYSELF SAYS I THERE'S SOMETHING UP
AND GOD KNOWS THE SCANDAL THAT FOLLOWED I CAN TELL YOU EVERY PARTICULAR THAT YOU MAY WISH TO LEARN MY DEAR BARON
MY LORD
MY LORD
IF YOU'RE STUMPED THE OGRESS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC WILL GIVE YOU TICK FOR YOUR PRETTY FACE SHE WON'T
AT LAST I WENT BACK AGAIN AND I ASSURE YOU M
YOU WILL THERE FIND MY COMPANION SHE REPLIED
YOU WILL LAUGH AT ME HE SAID AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY I THOUGHT SOME ONE WAS FOLLOWING US THE COACH AT THIS MOMENT TURNED ROUND A CORNER AND MURPHY WHO HAD NOT LOST SIGHT OF IT WITH HIS EYES AND HAD SEEN RODOLPH'S MANOEUVRE RAN AND PICKED UP THE LITTLE NOTE WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO A CREVICE BETWEEN TWO OF THE PAVING-STONES
THIS ABSENCE OF RANCOUR AND THE SAVAGE PRIDE WITH WHICH HE BOASTED OF NEVER HAVING ROBBED PROVED THAT THE CHOURINEUR WAS NOT AS YET THOROUGHLY HARDENED
PERHAPS I SHOULD KILL THEM IF YOUR PARENTS EVER LOVED YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE THEY WILL PITY PARDON AND STILL LOVE YOU
TO-MORROW AT ONE AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE PLAIN OF ST DENIS IN THE PLAIN OF ST DENIS BETWEEN ST OUEN AND THE ROAD OF LA REVOLTE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED I WILL BRING YOUR POCKETBOOK AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS I PROMISED YOU AND WE WILL AGREE IN THE OTHER MATTER IF YOU ARE REASONABLE NOW YOU GO TO THE RIGHT AND WE TO THE LEFT HAND
THANKS SIR SHE REPLIED BUT AFTER HAVING SEEN YOUR STRUGGLE IT HAS MADE MY HEART BEAT SO THAT I HAVE NO APPETITE POOH
YOU HAVE TOUCHED ME NEARLY
SPITE OF HIS YEARS AND EMBONPOINT MURPHY WAS ACTIVE AND ATHLETIC
RIGOLETTE HAS NO TIME DURING THE OTHER SIX DAYS OF THE WEEK TO THINK OF SWEETHEARTING
AND HOW LIKE HIS FATHER
WE CAN SEE A LONG WAY OFF
NOTHING WAS WANTING,--EVEN THE MILK-WHITE HEIFER MUSETTE HER FUTURE PET WAS PEACEFULLY GRAZING AS SHE HAD BEEN DESCRIBED
YOU DO KNOW HOW TO HANDLE YOUR FISTS
ALL I CAN SAY IS SHE WENT AS SHE CAME AND THAT IS ALL ABOUT IT
I SAW THEM AS PLAINLY AS I SEE YOU MY MAN
HE SAYS THAT CHARLOT THE EXECUTIONER WAITS FOR HIM AND HE CAN ONLY LOSE HIS HEAD ONCE AND SO HE WILL KILL ALL HE CAN KILL TO TRY AND ESCAPE
THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED,--SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE
BRAS ROUGE HAS A ROOM HERE BUT DOES NOT OCCUPY IT OFTEN
BUT FOR THE HIDEOUSNESS OF HIS FEATURES AND THE FIERCE GLANCE OF HIS EYES ALWAYS RESTLESS AND SUSPICIOUS THIS FELLOW MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY HIS QUIET AND STEADY STEP FOR AN HONEST CITIZEN
BUT YOUR KIND ENDEAVOUR IN MY BEHALF HAS THROWN IN YOUR WAY ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE BEING M
THE MAN YOU HAVE ASSASSINATED CAME TO YOU IN FULL CONFIDENCE NOT SUSPECTING YOUR SANGUINARY PURPOSE
IT WAS AT THIS CRISIS THAT SEYTON AND SARAH WERE PRESENTED AND RECEIVED AT THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN WITH SUCH EXTREME DISTINCTION
AND THEN AFTER SOME MINUTES SILENCE HE EXCLAIMED UNDER A FRESH IMPULSE OF UNGOVERNABLE FURY AND IT IS YOU I HAVE TO THANK FOR ALL THIS
IT WOULD OCCUPY TOO MUCH TIME TO TELL YOU BY WHAT TRAIN OF EVENTS MY LORD BECAME AWARE OF THE MISFORTUNES OF THIS EXCELLENT WOMAN AS WELL AS THE TIES WHICH CONNECT HER WITH THE D'HARVILLE FAMILY
THE SCHOOLMASTER GAVE A NOD IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND THEN HALF DRAWING OUT OF THE POCKET OF HIS FROCK COAT A STILETTO ROUND AND AS THICK AS A GOOSE'S QUILL WITH A HANDLE OF WOOD WHICH DISAPPEARED IN THE GRASP OF HIS HAIRY FINGERS SAID
HE MADE HIM ROBUST ACTIVE AND DARING WITH A LOVE FOR ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND RIGHT AND A HATRED FOR WHATSOEVER WAS WICKED AND BAD
AT THE SIGHT OF THE DAISIES AND BUTTERCUPS GOUALEUSE COULD NOT RESTRAIN HER TRANSPORT,--SHE DID NOT LEAVE ONE FLOWER WHICH SHE COULD GATHER
THE EMPEROR WHOSE WARM REGARD FOR THE LATE MARQUIS HAD TAKEN ITS DATE FROM THE PERIOD OF THAT NOBLEMAN'S EMIGRATION TO RUSSIA EXERTED HIS POWERFUL INFLUENCE IN CONGRESS SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT AT THE GRAND MEETING TO DECIDE THE DESTINIES OF THE PRINCES OF GERMANY THE FATHER OF OUR NOBLE EMPLOYER WAS REINSTATED IN ALL HIS PRISTINE RIGHTS
ON THE CONTRARY IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS SON HE DID NOT UNFORTUNATELY REFLECT THAT HE WAS ADMITTING INTO THE CLOSEST INTIMACY A YOUNG GIRL OF SURPASSING BEAUTY AND OF LIVELY WIT AS RODOLPH MUST DISCOVER AT EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY
IN VAIN I TRY TO PUSH IT AWAY
MIND AND DON'T STEP UPON IT RODOLPH HAD NOT REMARKED ONE OF THOSE SUBTERRANEANS WHICH USED TO BE SEEN SOME YEARS SINCE IN CERTAIN SPOTS IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND PARTICULARLY NEAR THE COURS LA REINE
YOU KNOW WELL THAT THE CHILD WHOSE DEATH I DAILY DEPLORE--THAT THAT DAUGHTER WHOM I SHOULD HAVE LOVED THE MORE AS HER UNWORTHY MOTHER SARAH HAD SHOWN HERSELF SO UTTERLY INDIFFERENT ABOUT HER--WOULD HAVE BEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LIKE THIS UNHAPPY GIRL
BUT THROUGH YOU I SHOULD HAVE HAD MY BLESSED EYES TO SEE MY OWN WAY WITH
IT IS AT THE BACK OF A CHAMBERLAIN THAT THE SYMBOL OF HIS OFFICE GLITTERS AND AS MONSEIGNEUR AVERS THE WORTHY D'HARNEIM ALWAYS SEEMS TEMPTED TO PRESENT HIMSELF BACKWARDS THAT HIS IMPORTANCE MAY AT ONCE BE SEEN FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT IS THAT THE INCESSANT SUBJECT OF THE COUNT'S MEDITATIONS IS TO ASCERTAIN BY WHAT FATAL IMAGINATION AND DIRECTION THE CHAMBERLAIN'S KEY HAS BEEN PLACED BEHIND THE CHAMBERLAIN'S BACK
THEN THIS HORRIBLE RESULT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED THAT WAS YOUR AFFAIR M
I HAVE A GOOD NUMBER IN THE CONSCRIPTION AND MY NAME IS RODOLPH DURAND
AS I AM A MAN I DID NOT MEAN TO DO IT WHY WOULD YOU NOT HAVE BEATEN ME
MY LORD THAT'S TRUE
TO ST DENIS
A PAIR OF PRETTY CREATURES THEY LOOK AS EVER YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE AND I DOUBT NOT SICK ENOUGH OF EACH OTHER'S COMPANY BY THIS TIME AND MY POOR MURPHY
BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS SINCERE
THE PRETTY VILLAGE BUILT FACING THE SOUTH THE FARM THE MEADOW THE BEAUTIFUL COWS THE LITTLE WINDING RIVER THE CHESTNUT GROVE THE CHURCH IN THE DISTANCE,--THE WHOLE PICTURE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED WAS BEFORE HER EYES
WHILST SOME DUMB AND MOTIONLESS LOOKED ON MECHANICALLY AT THE WET WHICH FELL AND FLOWED IN TORRENTS
I AM LOSING MY GOOD SPIRITS MY TEMPER AND BECOMING GLOOMY SUSPICIOUS PEEVISH AND ILL-NATURED
BETWEEN THE DEPTH OF MISERY THE DEGRADATION IN WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS EXISTED AND THE POSITION IN WHICH RODOLPH NOW PLACED HIM THERE WAS AN ABYSS SO WIDE THAT THE SERVICE HE HAD RENDERED TO RODOLPH IMPORTANT AS IT WAS COULD NOT FILL IT UP
BUT WILL YOU NOT LIKE TO SEE THE ROOMS UP-STAIRS I SHALL BE GLAD TO DO SO IF PERFECTLY CONVENIENT
I HAVE DAWDLED,--HAVE I NOT MONSIEUR SAID SHE GAILY
THE ATTACK WAS SO RAPID UNEXPECTED AND POWERFUL THAT RODOLPH COULD NEITHER FORESEE NOR AVOID IT
I HAD TWISTED ONE OF MY LEGS AROUND HIS BUT IN SPITE OF THAT HIS LOINS WERE SO POWERFUL THAT HE MOVED HIMSELF AND ME ON TO THE BARE GROUND
STARTLED BY THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH STRANGE CUSTOMERS THE OGRESS SHARED IN THE GENERAL SURPRISE
HARK SAID ONE OF THEM
SUCH THUMPS
AT THE WORDS MY CHILD GOUALEUSE TURNED HER LARGE EYES SLOWLY TOWARDS HER PROTECTRESS AND CONTEMPLATED HER FOR SOME MOMENTS WITH A LOOK OF UNUTTERABLE GRATITUDE
IT IS A RUM START BUT DO AS YOU LIKE WITH ME
THERE YOU COULD SHAVE WITH IT
I HAD DRANK TOO WITH THE TALL MAN AND THE LITTLE WOMAN DRESSED IN MAN'S CLOTHES SO YOU MAY BELIEVE MY HEAD WAS RATHER HEAVY AND BESIDES NOTHING SENDS ME OFF TO SLEEP LIKE A GOOD FALL OF RAIN
YOU KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT YOU TOLD ME AFTER YOU RETURNED FROM THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU HAD GONE WITH POOR GOUALEUSE TRY AND FIND THE SCHOOLMASTER IN THE CITE
AFTERWARDS THE DESIRE OF LIFE CAME BACK TO ME NAY NIGHTMARE CEASED TO TORMENT ME AND I DID AS OTHERS DID AT THE BAGNE YOU WERE IN A GOOD SCHOOL FOR LEARNING HOW TO THIEVE YES BUT IT WAS NOT TO MY TASTE
AND WHAT THEN THE PORTER ALLOWED ME TO LOOK FOR THE CREATURE AND I WENT TROTTING ALL AROUND THE GARDEN CALLING COCOTTE
AT LENGTH TURNING TO PIPELET HE INQUIRED
AT LAST HORRIFIED AT THE PROGRESS OF HIS ILLNESS BROKEN DOWN BY BODILY ANGUISH AND THINKING THAT AS DEATH ALSO STARED HIM IN THE FACE HE HAD ONE CHANCE LEFT IN TRUSTING TO THE GENEROSITY OF HIS SLAVE AFTER MANY DISTRUSTING DOUBTS WILLIS ORDERED DAVID TO BE UNCHAINED AND DAVID SAVED THE PLANTER FOR FIVE DAYS AND FIVE NIGHTS HE WATCHED AND TENDED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS FATHER COUNTERACTING THE DISEASE STEP BY STEP WITH GREAT SKILL AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE UNTIL AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED IN DEFEATING IT TO THE EXTREME SURPRISE OF THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR AND WHO DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN RESTORED TO HEALTH AT LAST THE COLONIST NOT DESIRING TO BLUSH BEFORE HIS OWN SLAVE WHOSE PRESENCE CONSTANTLY OPPRESSED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS EXCESSIVE NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT THE COLONIST MADE AN ENORMOUS SACRIFICE TO ATTACH THE DOCTOR HE HAD SENT FOR TO HIS ESTABLISHMENT AND DAVID WAS AGAIN CONDUCTED TO HIS DUNGEON HORRIBLE BUT BY NO
I HOPE NOT FOR YOUR SAKE MY FINE FELLOW SAID THE AGENT
AND FURTHER PAID SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE BECAUSE HE SAID THE GENTLEMAN DID NOT WISH TO BE BORED ABOUT REFERENCES
IF NOT TO-MORROW EVERYTHING SHALL BE SIGNED AND YOU WILL START FOR ALGIERS WITH A PERSON COMMISSIONED BY THE FORMER PROPRIETOR OF THE FARM TO PUT YOU IN FULL POSSESSION
I WAS ONLY SAYING SO TO M
ONLY SHE IS CHEAPER AND MORE EASY TO DEAL WITH THAN THE REGULAR PAWNBROKERS
BUT GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO LOVE AND FEAR HIM THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY AND THOSE WHO REPENT THEN MY GOOD MADAME GEORGES I AM DOUBLY HAPPY AT WHAT I HAVE DONE
WE WERE BOTH IN THE WRONG MY GOOD FRIEND SAID RODOLPH MILDLY
KILLED AN OLD WOMAN YESTERDAY IN THE RUE ST CHRISTOPHE AND ROBBED HER CHAMBER
THE NEXT THING WAS TO ENABLE IT TO REACH ITS ADDRESS
DO I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHTLY SHE CRIED AT LENGTH HALF BREATHLESS WITH EMOTION
THE SCHOOLMASTER ATTEMPTED TO ARREST RODOLPH'S PROGRESS BUT HE TURNING TO HIM GAVE HIM TWO OR THREE RAPID BLOWS WITH HIS FISTS OVER THE NOSE AND EYES AND WITH SUCH POTENT EFFECT THAT THE BEAST STAGGERED WITH VERY GIDDINESS AND FELL HEAVILY AGAINST A TABLE WHICH ALONE PREVENTED HIS PROSTRATION ON THE FLOOR
AH AT THE RECOLLECTIONS BROUGHT BACK BY THIS NAME THE PORTER'S DECLARATION OF COURAGE AND ENDURANCE UTTERLY FAILED HIM AND AGAIN HIS CLENCHED FISTS WERE RAISED AS THOUGH TO INVOKE THE VENGEANCE HE HAD SO LATELY DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS DESPISING
AND NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE CHOURINEUR WAS AT ST OUEN
THAT MUST NOT BE PERMITTED
WHEN THE NOISE OF RODOLPH'S BODY ROLLING DOWN THE STEPS HAD CEASED THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO KNEW ALL THE WAYS AND WINDINGS OF THE UNDERGROUND VAULTS IN THE PLACE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS SLOWLY LISTENING AS HE WENT
NOW I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW WHO WOULD DARE WRITE ME A LOVE-LETTER
RETURN IT TO ME AND TO-MORROW I WILL GIVE YOU TWENTY-FIVE LOUIS D'ORS SAID TOM TO THE SCHOOLMASTER WHOSE HAND RELAXED SOMETHING OF ITS FIERCE GRIPE
HE HEARD QUITE WELL WHAT RODOLPH SAID TO HIM AND THAT WAS THE VERY REASON HE COULD NOT CREDIT WHAT HE HEARD
WHETHER FOUNDED ON A TRUE OR FALSE PRESAGE THIS LETTER SEEMED TO RODOLPH TO WEAR A MOURNFUL LOOK AS THOUGH EVIL OR MISERY WERE CONTAINED WITHIN ITS SHABBY FOLDS
MY EYES
IN AN OPEN CUPBOARD FASTENED TO THE WALL THERE WERE SEVERAL FLASKS OF GLASS SO FASHIONED AS TO REPRESENT THE PEDESTRIAN FIGURE OF THE EMPEROR
I HAVE JUDGED YOU AND JUDGED YOU WELL AND I HAVE RESOLVED TO RECOMPENSE YOU BUT M
SO THAT WHEN ONLY IN HIS FIFTEENTH OR SIXTEENTH YEAR HE WAS ALWAYS THE CONQUEROR IN HIS CONTESTS WITH YOUNG MEN HIS SUPERIORS IN AGE
TWO YEARS RENT WILL BE DUE AND PAID TO YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL
D'HARVILLE
D'HARVILLE
RIGOLETTE I SUPPOSE SINCE HE QUITTED THE HOUSE NO MONSIEUR
I AM AN OLD COCK AND KNOW MY GAME AS WELL AS MOST SAID RODOLPH
YOUR MODEL FARM AS YOU TERM IT BUILT BY YOU TO INSTRUCT TO ENCOURAGE AND TO REWARD DESERVING LABOURERS HAS BEEN OF INCALCULABLE SERVICE TO THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY
MY TEMPLES BEAT AS THEY USED WHEN I WAS GOING TO SEE RED COME HERE THOU--AH MADELON LET ME STAB YOU DEAD THEN HIS EYES SPARKLED WITH A FIERCE DELIGHT AND NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF RODOLPH THE CHOURINEUR LIFTED THE SHEEP WITHOUT AN EFFORT
I WOULD HAVE RUN TO THE END OF THE WORLD RATHER THAN BE AGAIN IN THE CHOUETTE'S HANDS
ON THE CONTRARY SO THAT THE HANDSOME SCOTCH LASSIE SHOULD ONE DAY ENCIRCLE HER IMPERIAL FOREHEAD WITH A SOVEREIGN CROWN THE HAUGHTY PAIR AGREED TO CONDESCEND TO SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THRONE THEY COVETED
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE WERE AGAIN ON BOARD THE BRIG WHICH INSTANTLY SET SAIL IT APPEARS TO ME MY DEAR MURPHY THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS OVERPAID THIS WRETCH FOR THE LOSS OF HIS SLAVES
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE A DROP OF REALLY GOOD CORDIAL SUCH A DAY AS THIS
I WENT BACK TO THE CHOURINEUR WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME AT ST OUEN
WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THOSE PISTOLS INQUIRED RODOLPH
AND NOW YOU SUPPOSE WE WERE CLEAR OF M
BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE ALMANACH DE GOTHA FOR THE YEAR OF GRACE 1819 SEYTON ARRANGED BEFORE HE LEFT SCOTLAND A SORT OF SYNOPSIS OF THE AGES OF ALL THE KINGS AND RULING POWERS IN EUROPE THEN UNMARRIED
HIS RESPIRATION IS VERY DIFFICULT NOT OUT OF DANGER HIS CASE IS VERY CRITICAL MY LORD
YOU SHALL SEE HOW I HANDLE A KNIFE
IN THE MUD THERE WERE LITTLE AND LARGE FOOTSTEPS AND AT THE END OF THE ENTRANCE A SMALL GARDEN-GATE WHERE THE TRACES ENDED
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED YOU MANY YEARS OF SORROW AH M
AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER--I WAS I THINK ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD--I WAS WITH AN OLD ONE-EYED WOMAN WHOM THEY CALL THE CHOUETTE,[6 BECAUSE SHE HAD A HOOKED NOSE A GREEN EYE QUITE ROUND AND WAS LIKE AN OWL WITH ONE EYE OUT 6 THE SCREECH-OWL
RODOLPH NONE OF THAT NONSENSICAL GENEROSITY
FOR I AM WELL AWARE THERE ARE CERTAIN POINTS THE CLEARING UP OF WHICH HIS HIGHNESS RESERVES FOR HIMSELF AND OF COURSE YOUR AGENT IS FAR FROM SUSPECTING THE DEEP INTEREST HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAS IN THE MATTER ENTIRELY SO
BUT I WILL BE REVENGED HE IS THE MAN I MEAN SAID SARAH
AH CRIED THE AESCULAPIUS OBSERVING THE TABLE ATTENTIVELY HAPPILY YOU TOOK THE WRONG PHIAL,--I WANTED THE OTHER ONE WHAT THAT LITTLE ONE WITH THE RED STUFF INQUIRED THE UNLUCKY SICK-NURSE IN A LOW AND HUMBLE TONE
OH THE UNFORTUNATE EXCLAIMED RODOLPH WITH BITTERNESS
AT NIGHT I HID MYSELF IN A TIMBER-YARD UNDER SOME PILES OF WOOD
BUT HIS COMING WAS A CHANCE AND HE CERTAINLY DID GIVE ME MY FULL ALLOWANCE WHEN WE MET GO ON MY CHILD SAID RODOLPH
RODOLPH IT IS REALLY VERY EASY IF YOU WILL BUT CONSIDER A LITTLE
YET SHE IS SO VERY HANDSOME,--SO SEDUCTIVE
HE STARTED BACK
IT WILL BE DAYLIGHT DIRECTLY DAY
AH MONSIEUR YOU ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE US ALL FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU CRIED MADAME PIPELET NODDING HER APPROVAL OF THE COMMISSION AND THEREBY SENDING THE FLUSH OF PLEASURE INTO A FACE GLOWING WITH ALL THE FIERY HONOURS OF AN EXCITED BACCHANTE
THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE STILL AND QUIET IT IS BUILT FACING THE SOUTH AND HALF SURROUNDED BY TREES AND CLOSE BY FLOWS A GENTLE RIVER EXACTLY!--A CLEAR GENTLY FLOWING RIVER
AND THIS PECULIAR CHARM SERVED INVARIABLY TO DISTINGUISH MADAME D'HARVILLE FROM ALL OTHER FASHIONABLE BEAUTIES
IT IS SO VERY LONG SINCE I HAVE BEEN OUT OF PARIS NOT SINCE YOUR GRAND DOINGS WITH RIGOLETTE YES INDEED M
THIS WAS MY FIRST INTENTION,--IT WAS NOT LEGAL
BY DEGREES HE FOUND HIMSELF LEAGUED WITH POLIDORI ALTHOUGH FROM VERY INNOCENT CAUSES BY THE SAME TIES THAT UNITE TWO GUILTY PERSONS
YOU HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THAT SAID THE CHOURINEUR STRIKING A LIGHT FOR HIS PIPE
SNATCHED BY THE CHOURINEUR FROM A CERTAIN DEATH AND REMOVED TO THE HOUSE IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES WHICH HAD BEEN RECONNOITRED BY THE CHOUETTE PREVIOUSLY TO THE ATTEMPT ON IT BY THE SCHOOLMASTER RODOLPH WAS PLACED IN BED IN A COMFORTABLY FURNISHED APARTMENT
AND THIS LADY WILL PERMIT ME TO STAY WITH HER
THOUGH RODOLPH HAD NOT SEEN POLIDORI DURING THE LAST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS HE HAD A THOUSAND REASONS FOR KEEPING EVERY FEATURE WELL IN HIS REMEMBRANCE
WHEN I LOSE MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY I SHALL TAKE A RAKE AND A WICKER BASKET LIKE THE OLD RAG-PICKER WHOM I SEE IN THE RECOLLECTIONS OF MY CHILDHOOD 7 A DISEASE OF THE SKIN TO WHICH ALL WHO WORK IN THE WATER ARE LIABLE
RODOLPH WAS ALONE FOR ONE MOMENT ONLY DURING WHICH BRAS ROUGE AND THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD TIME TO EXCHANGE SOME WORDS RAPIDLY UTTERED AND SOME MYSTERIOUS SIGNS
IT IS REALLY VERY DROLL
A DOUBLE ROW OF NAILS DECORATED HIS HEAVY SHOES AND EXCEPT THAT HIS HANDS WERE OF MOST ARISTOCRATIC SHAPE NOTHING DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM THE OTHER GUESTS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC
TWO OR THREE OUT-BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED OF WORM-EATEN PLANKS SERVING AS CELLAR WOOD-HOUSE AND RABBIT-HUTCHES SURROUNDED THIS WRETCHED DEN
THIS EVENING--TEN O'CLOCK
HE ATE IT OFF WITH VITRIOL YOU JEST IF HE COMES IN THIS EVENING YOU'LL SEE
RIGOLETTE AND SHE IS WELL WORTHY OF HIS CONFIDENCE IF HIS LETTERS WERE FILLED WITH GOLD
AND DON'T SQUEEZE SO HARD
HIS GRAY EYES WERE BRIGHT SMALL CIRCULAR AND SPARKLED SAVAGELY
RODOLPH THE EXPRESSION OF HER GRATITUDE TO YOU HAD NOTHING EXAGGERATED IN IT
HERE IS A CAPITAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EXERCISING YOUR SKILL
BY A LUCKY CHANCE SOME DAYS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF SARAH THE YOUNG PRINCE HAD GONE AWAY TO THE INSPECTION OF TROOPS WITH AN AIDE-DE-CAMP AND THE FAITHFUL MURPHY
THE KNIFE LAD
I TOLD YOU THAT OUR BARGAIN WAS CONDITIONAL
THE WHOLE FINISHED BY A SPLENDID SABLE COLLAR AND CUFFS
COME SIT DOWN AT ONCE AND KEEP STILL BUT DOCTOR DON'T YOU PERCEIVE I AM AS DIRTY AS A PILE OF FLOATING WOOD JUST GOING TO BE UNLOADED?--ALL SLIME AND WET YOU SEE
SHE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME A RAP WELL THEN WILL YOU GO TO BRAS ROUGE NO NO
THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT YOU DID SAY BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS M
COME NOW DON'T CHAFF ME HE REPLIED WITH SURPRISE
I SELECTED FOR YOU THE BUSINESS OF A BUTCHER BECAUSE YOUR INCLINATIONS AND TASTE SEEMED TO LIE IN THAT DIRECTION ALAS
DESPITE HIS HARDIHOOD THE SCHOOLMASTER RETREATED A STEP SO THREATENING WERE THE LOOKS SO COMMANDING THE DEPORTMENT OF RODOLPH
ALONG THE TRELLISING BETWEEN THE ORANGE-TREES AND AMID THE CLUMPS WERE TRAINED EVERY VARIETY OF RARE CLIMBING PLANTS
THE WALK 80 IX
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT
THE GOUALEUSE HORROR-STRUCK AT MEETING WITH THE CHOUETTE AND DREADING THE THREATS OF THE SCHOOLMASTER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE TUMULT AND CONFUSION CAUSED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO FRESH GUESTS IN THE TAPIS-FRANC AND QUIETLY GLIDING OUT BY THE HALF-OPENED DOOR LEFT THE CABARET
I DARE SAY THOUGH IT WAS TO SEE WHERE THE LADY WENT TO FOR HE IS AS MISCHIEVOUS AS A MAGPIE AND AS PRYING AS A FERRET FOR ALL HIS CLUB-FOOT SO THEN THOUGHT RODOLPH THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THIS UNHAPPY LADY WILL SOON BE KNOWN TO THIS IMPOSTER SINCE IT IS DOUBTLESS BY HIS DIRECTIONS SHE IS FOLLOWED AND WATCHED BY THIS IMP OF AN EMISSARY WELL SIR AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE APARTMENT
A TEAR HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN UPON IT
IT HAS BEEN GONE UPWARDS OF AN HOUR ANSWERED I ENJOYING HIS FURY AND DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT YOU WILL HEAR ALL ABOUT IT
HIS NAME IS GAUTHIER IN THE RUE DES BOURDONNAIS A BEAST--BRUTE--THIEF--MISER
CAN YOU NOT TRUST ME MY DEAR CHILD?--YES CHILD
AH HERE IS THE DARLING ONE ORIGINAL ETCHING BY ADRIAN MARCEL IT WOULD BE IN THE WAY MY MAN SAID THE OLD WOMAN WHO QUICKLY DISAPPEARED WITH TORTILLARD IN THE MIDST OF THE FOG WHICH THICKENED WITH THE TWILIGHT AND THE HOLLOW MURMUR OF THE WIND AS IT MOANED THROUGH THE THICK AND LEAFLESS BRANCHES OF THE TALL ELMS IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
YOU PLACED THE SCHOOLMASTER AT ST MANDE SAID RODOLPH
BUT WHOSE BIT OF A HAND IS IT I HAVE GOT HOLD OF
NOR WAS IT UNTIL THE BROTHER AND SISTER SAW THE UNBRIDLED PASSION OF THEIR DUPE REACH ITS UTMOST EXCESS AND THAT HIS INFATUATION WHICH HE COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN THREATENED TO BURST FORTH AFRESH AND DESTROY ALL THAT THEY RESOLVED ON THEIR FINAL COUP
AND OUTSIDE THE WINDOW GROW AN ENORMOUS ROSE-TREE AND HONEYSUCKLE WHICH ENTIRELY COVER THIS SIDE OF THE FARM AND SO SURROUND YOUR CASEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE ONLY TO STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TO GATHER A LARGE BUNCH OF ROSES AND HONEYSUCKLE WET WITH THE EARLY MORNING DEW AH M
HOW NICE SUCH WORK MUST BE,--MERE AMUSEMENT QUITE A RECREATION
IN VAIN
FOR WHEN THE STEPS WERE LET DOWN INSTEAD OF ALIGHTING SHE SAID SOME FEW WORDS TO THE DRIVER WHO MUCH SURPRISED SHUT THE DOOR UP AGAIN THEN THE LADY DID NOT GET OUT NO
AND THAT IS WHY I LOVE IT SO WHEN RODOLPH AND GOUALEUSE HAD REACHED THE QUAI AUX FLEURS A COACH WAS WAITING THERE INTO WHICH RODOLPH HANDED GOUALEUSE
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING AND TELLING HIM AT ONCE THAT HIS MADAME HAD BEEN AND GONE WE ALLOWED HIM TO FUME AND FRET FOR A WHOLE HOUR
I STRONGLY SUSPECTED HE WAS DONE AGAIN AND PIPELET AND ME WERE ENJOYING A HEARTY GOOD LAUGH OVER IT WHEN THE COMMANDANT ARRIVED
HOWEVER TELL ME HAVE I ANY NEED TO SEE M
BEFORE TOM COULD MAKE THE SLIGHTEST STRUGGLE THE CHOUETTE HAD EMPTIED HIS POCKETS WITH SINGULAR DEXTERITY
ONE OF THE TWO VERY PALE AND LIVID PULLED FROM TIME TO TIME HIS SHABBY SKULL-CAP OVER HIS BROWS AND CONCEALED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE HIS LEFT HAND AND EVEN WHEN COMPELLED TO USE IT HE DID SO WITH CAUTION
ALL AT ONCE THE DOOR OF THE VAULT WAS ABRUPTLY OPENED FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND THE SWELLING MASSES CONTAINED IN THE INNER VAULT GLAD TO FIND A FURTHER OUTLET RUSHED ONWARDS AS THOUGH BURSTING THROUGH THE GATES OF A SLUICE AND THE CHOURINEUR WHOSE OPPORTUNE RETURN SHALL BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY AND BY SEIZED THE TWO ARMS OF RODOLPH WHO HALF DEAD HAD MECHANICALLY CLUNG TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR AND BORE HIM FROM THE BLACK AND RUSHING WATERS WHICH HAD NIGH PROVED HIS GRAVE
MADAME PIPELET HOWEVER RESUMED HER NARRATION WITH A MIRTHFUL CHUCKLE THAT INCREASED HER UGLINESS
HAVE YOU LIVED A LONG TIME WITH THE OGRESS MY POOR GIRL ASKED RODOLPH IN ACCENTS OF THE DEEPEST COMPASSION
THERE CAN BE NO MANNER OF DOUBT BUT THAT MADAME SERAPHIN THIS WORTHY GENTLEMAN'S HOUSEKEEPER COULD IF SHE PLEASED THROW AN ENTIRE LIGHT UPON EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECTED WITH LA GOUALEUSE BRAVO MY DEAR BARON EXCLAIMED MURPHY
IF I FIND A SNUG CORNER AS IT RAINS I WILL REMAIN THERE ALL DAY PERHAPS ALL NIGHT AND TO-MORROW MORNING I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT AND READY TO GO TO M
IN ORDER TO PROFIT BY THE PARTICULARS FURNISHED BY BARON DE GRAUEN RESPECTING LA GOUALEUSE AND GERMAIN THE SCHOOLMASTER'S SON IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR RODOLPH TO VISIT THE HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE FORMERLY THE ABODE OF THAT YOUNG MAN WHOSE RETREAT THE PRINCE LIKEWISE HOPED TO DISCOVER THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF MLLE
IT IS HER ONLY LUXURY,--SHE IS LIKE A LITTLE DUCK ALWAYS DABBLING IN IT
THE SUN'S RAYS MISERY AND THE SEVERE TOIL OF THE GALLEYS HAD BRONZED HIS SKIN TO THAT DEEP AND OLIVE HUE WHICH IS PECULIAR TO CONVICTS
MANOEUVRE COEUR CHEF-D'OEUVRE COUP-D'OEIL THROUGHOUT THE TEXT ILLUSTRATIONS AND THEIR CAPTIONS WERE PLACED ON FACING PAGES
HELMINA AND I NURSED HER UNTIL SHE WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT AGAIN AND THEN WITH THE REST OF MY MONEY I ENABLED HER TO RETURN TO HER WASHING-TUBS AND WHEN ALL YOUR MONEY WAS SPENT ON LORRAINE AND HER INFANT WHAT DID YOU DO MY CHILD INQUIRED RODOLPH
NOW I UNDERSTAND IT ALL
FOR WHAT PURPOSE WE SHALL SEE HEREAFTER
IT WAS THEN THAT THIS WOMAN EVINCED ALL THOSE EXACTIONS WHICH WERE SO NEW TO AND SO MUCH ASTONISHED RODOLPH
I TOOK AWAY THE BRAT BECAUSE YOU WERE FOND OF HIM AND IT WILL BE A MEANS OF COMPELLING YOU TO SEND ME MONEY WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE OF SERVICE TO HIM,--THAT'S MY AFFAIR
THE ONE-EYED WAS AT HER USUAL SPOT AND FROM TIME TO TIME SHOOK HER DOUBLED FIST AT ME
THOSE KIND OF PERSONS SAID MADAME D'HARVILLE ONE DAY LAUGHINGLY APPEAR TO ME AS IF THEIR WHOLE LIVES WERE PASSED IN DANCING LE CAVALIER SEUL BEFORE AN INVISIBLE MIRROR AN UNASSUMING AND UNPRETENDING PERSON HOWEVER RESERVED AND CONSEQUENTLY UNPOPULAR HE MIGHT BE WITH OTHERS WAS SURE TO FIND A STEADY FRIEND AND PARTIAL OBSERVER IN MADAME D'HARVILLE
LE COMTE THE AMBASSADOR WITH HIS LADY HAD PURPOSELY REMAINED IN THE FIRST RECEPTION-ROOM UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF RODOLPH WHO NOW ENTERED FOLLOWED BY MURPHY AND M
YOU ARE AS CLEAN AS A KITTEN OR ELSE I WOULD NEVER HAVE TRUSTED YOU WITH THAT SHAWL
NOT CONTENT YET,--GRUMBLING STILL SAID THE UNKNOWN WITH A MENACING TONE
BUT TO TOUCH UPON YOUR COURAGE AND DEVOTION IS ONLY TO REPEAT WHAT EVERY ONE KNOWS
OR AT LEAST THE PLEASANT PART OF IT
WHAT WAS HER SURPRISE HER ASTONISHMENT AT THE SCENE WHICH REVEALED ITSELF TO HER GAZE
QUITE WELL IS THE ENTRY DIFFICULT A WALL SEVEN FEET HIGH ON THE SIDE OF THE ALLEE DES VEUVES A GARDEN WINDOWS DOWN TO THE GROUND AND THE HOUSE HAS ONLY THE GROUND FLOOR THROUGHOUT AND THERE IS ONLY THE PORTER TO GUARD THIS TREASURE YES AND WHAT YOUNG MAN IS YOUR PROPOSED PLAN OF PROCEEDING SIMPLE ENOUGH
I AM SURE IT WAS A LUCKY CHANCE FOR US SENT YOU HERE I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT SO MADAME
THE BLACK RETURNED
DID YOU NOT HEAR IT YES YES I HEARD IT
AND THEN SUCH WHIFFS OF SULPHUR CHARCOAL AND MELTED LEAD AS YOU GO UP THE STAIRS
A PALE WITHERED COUNTENANCE
WHO WAS THIS SCENTED EMBLAZONED CORRESPONDENT OF OLD ANASTASIA PIPELET
MONSEIGNEUR THE COUNTESS AND HER BROTHER--THEY ARE AT THE END OF THE STREET AT THESE WORDS RODOLPH MADE AN IMPATIENT AND ANGRY GESTURE THREW A LOUIS D'OR ON THE BAR OF THE OGRESS AND MADE FOR THE DOOR IN HASTE
HE MEANT TO POSSESS HER AND HE WOULD
THE LANTERN THAT LIGHTED US THREW OVER THIS SCENE A STILL MORE GHASTLY HUE
THE LORD WILL FINISH HIS WORK AND I WILL PRAY TO HIM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE HAD COMPASSION ON ME AND HAVE LED ME TO HIM FATHER SAID LA GOUALEUSE THROWING HERSELF ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE PRIEST
RODOLPH,--A SMALL SAINT ESPRIT SCULPTURED IN LAPIS LAZULI TIED ROUND HIS NECK BY A CHAIN OF SILVER
BUT AS HE SLACKED HIS STEPS THE DOOR WAS HASTILY SHUT
HE'S BOULOTTE'S MAN
LET'S KEEP BACK A BIT FOR FEAR WE FRIGHTEN HER AWAY THE COACHMAN GOT OFF HIS BOX AND OPENED THE DOOR
RODOLPH HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THIS ILL-USED SAVAGE OF CIVILISATION WHOM MISERY HAD BEEN UNABLE WHOLLY TO CORRUPT
THE BEATEN MAN AND THE GOUALEUSE FIRST ENTERED THE TAPIS-FRANC
DAVID MIGHT CHOOSE ANOTHER WIFE OR MISTRESS WHICHSOEVER MIGHT BEST SUIT HIS INCLINATION
RODOLPH REPLIED IN A LOUD VOICE
IT IS ONLY A SHAM TILL MY MAN CAN AFFORD TO GIVE ME A REAL ONE THAT WILL DEPEND ON THIS GENTLEMAN FINETTE
CERTAIN FEELINGS OF DELIGHT PRODUCE IN THE MIND AN UNSPEAKABLE SADNESS,--A HOLY MELANCHOLY
BUT THIS EVENING OR NEVER
I HAVE MY OWN HOURS OF GLOOM AND MELANCHOLY AND MY SUFFERINGS WOULD BE MUCH INCREASED WERE I COMPELLED TO FEIGN A LIGHTNESS OF HEART I DID NOT REALLY POSSESS CAN IT BE POSSIBLE M
THE REST IS YOUR AFFAIR I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT
THAT'S THE MAN WHO HAS JUST GONE OUT
HER FULL AND DARK EYES NOW SPARKLING NOW LANGUISHING BENEATH HER COAL BLACK BROW COULD WELL DISSIMULATE ALL THE WARMTH OF LOVE AND DESIRE
NOW SUPPOSE
MY DEAR BARON EXCLAIMED MURPHY HEAVING A DEEP SIGH WHAT AN UNFORTUNATE THING IT IS THAT THIS ACCURSED COUNTESS SHOULD BE LEFT A WIDOW AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT SHE WAS MARRIED I THINK IN 1827 OR 1828 IN 1827 SHORTLY AFTER THE DEATH OF THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD WHO WOULD NOW BE IN HER SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEENTH YEAR AND WHOSE LOSS HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS SEEMS DAILY MORE TO DEPLORE FAR MORE SO INDEED THAN HE APPEARS TO FEEL FOR THE LOSS OF HIS LEGITIMATE OFFSPRING AND THUS MY DEAR BARON WE MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE DEEP INTEREST HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TAKES IN THE POOR GOUALEUSE ARISING AS IT DOES FROM THE FACT THAT THE DAUGHTER SO DEEPLY DEPLORED WOULD HAD SHE LIVED HAVE BEEN PRECISELY THE SAME AGE AS THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNG CREATURE IT IS INDEED AN UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR THAT THE COUNTESS SARAH FROM WHOM WE FANCIED WE WERE FOR EVER FREED SHOULD HAVE BECOME A WIDOW EXACTLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS HAD BEEN DEPRIVED BY DEATH OF THE WIFE WITH WHOM HE HAD
DURING THIS ABSENCE THE DOCTOR WAS BY NO MEANS IDLE
BUT TO WHAT AMOUNT DID SHE ADVANCE MONEY I'LL TELL YOU
BUT TOO QUICKLY DID THE HIDEOUS PICTURE RETURN AND SWEEP AWAY FOR EVER THE DEAR DELIGHT OF BELIEVING SO SWEET SO CALM AN EXISTENCE COULD EVER BE HERS
ONLY IMAGINE ONE DAY ON HER BIRTHDAY THE OGRESS KNOWING MY TASTE GAVE ME A LITTLE ROSE-TREE
THEY BOUGHT THEMSELVES SOME TOGGERY
THE WINE AND BRANDY HAD MADE HIM VERY COMMUNICATIVE
JACQUES FERRAND WHO LIVES IN THE RUE DU SENTIER DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED HE
SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD BUT TOOK ME BY THE HAND AND DRAGGED ME AWAY WITH HER
I ONLY PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD WELL THEN PUT UP YOUR LARDING-PIN INTO YOUR POCKET
RESEARCHES 225 XXII
OTHER TRANSCRIPTION NOTES APPEAR AT THE END OF THIS E-TEXT
WHICH BY THE WAY I CANNOT THINK WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN PLACED IN ANY DANGER FROM THE ATTEMPTS OF YOUR ENEMY TO DISTURB ITS REPOSE SINCE SHORTLY BEFORE YOU GAVE ME THOSE FRIGHTFUL PARTICULARS OF THE PRINCE'S CHARACTER HE HAD QUITE CEASED TO HONOUR ME WITH HIS VISITS ALTHOUGH ON THE MOST INTIMATE AND FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MY HUSBAND TALKING OF YOUR HUSBAND PRAY IS HE HERE TO-NIGHT INQUIRED SARAH
LET ME TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM
FOR THOSE THAT THEY SLAUGHTER ARE SOLD TO THE CAG-MAG SHOPS NEAR THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WHO CONVERT IT INTO BEEF MUTTON VEAL OR GAME ACCORDING TO THE TASTE OF PURCHASERS
I HAVE A RIGHT TO SELL MY THINGS FOR WHAT I CHOOSE MAY LUCIFER ONE DAY FRY YOU AS YOU DESERVE
AND THAT I THINK IS ALL I SHOULD WANT LET ME SEE
THE CHOUETTE TURNED HER BACK TO THIS WINDOW WHILST THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS AT ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND RODOLPH ON THE OTHER
WILL YOU RUN M
EXCEPT AN OLD PAIR OF WOOLLEN TROUSERS I WAS QUITE NAKED
YESTERDAY AFTER YOU HAD LEFT THE TAPIS-FRANC THERE CAME A TALL MAN WITH A WOMAN IN MAN'S ATTIRE WHO ASKED FOR ME
WE SHALL GIVE THE GENTLEMAN EVERY SATISFACTION AS PORTERS AND DOUBTLESS HE WILL ACT THE SAME BY US AS A LODGER
WHAT PLEASURE AND RODOLPH AND GOUALEUSE TAKING EACH OTHER'S HAND RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD OVER A LONG PIECE OF LATTER-GRASS JUST MOWED
ON EACH SIDE OF THIS ROOM THERE WERE SIX TABLES ONE END OF EACH OF WHICH WAS NAILED TO THE WALL AS WELL AS THE BENCHES ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM
NOW I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT REPLIED THE FAT PORTERESS SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS
DAY AND NIGHT TO ME ARE HENCEFORWARD ALL THE SAME EXCLAIMED THE SCHOOLMASTER IN SUCH PITEOUS TONES THAT RODOLPH UNABLE LONGER TO ENDURE THIS SCENE ABRUPTLY RETIRED FOLLOWED BY DAVID WHO FIRST DISMISSED HIS TWO ASSISTANTS
THOUGH HE HAD RUNG THE BELL WITH CONSIDERABLE VIOLENCE NO PERSON HAD AS YET REPLIED TO HIS SUMMONS
ROUND HIS GRACEFUL NECK AS ELEGANTLY MODELLED AS THAT OF THE INDIAN BACCHUS HE WORE A BLACK CRAVAT CARELESSLY TIED THE ENDS OF WHICH FELL ON THE COLLAR OF HIS BLUE BLOUSE
IF MY PARENTS NEVER LOVED ME WHAT SHOULD I GAIN BY DISCOVERING THEM
BUT YOU SHOULD WORK CONSTANTLY AND REGULARLY
MERCY SHRIEKED THE WRETCHED MAN AS HE WAS BEING REMOVED
THESE ARE HIS ORDERS NOTHING CAN BE BETTER AND I THINK HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT I HAVE COLLECTED
I FEEL THE MORE INCLINED TO ESPOUSE HIS CAUSE FROM THE RECOLLECTION THAT YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM ELSEWHERE BUT AT MY HOUSE AND BECAUSE I CAN ANSWER FOR HIS PRINCIPLES AND THAT HIS DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO YOU CAN ONLY BE EQUALLED BY THE DEEP RESPECT HE BEARS YOU I HAVE NEVER DOUBTED THE MANY NOBLE QUALITIES YOU HAVE SO REPEATEDLY ASSURED ME HE POSSESSES BUT YOU KNOW WELL THAT IT IS HIS LONG SUCCESSION OF BITTER AFFLICTIONS WHICH HAVE SO WARMLY INTERESTED ME IN HIS FAVOUR AND WELL DOES HE MERIT THIS INTEREST AND MOST FULLY DO HIS EXCELLENT QUALITIES ABSOLVE YOU OF ALL BLAME IN THUS BESTOWING IT
BUT COMRADE RODOLPH IS AN OUT-AND-OUT PAL HE IS
FINETTE DOES NOT MIND THE SMELL OF TOBACCO WELL THEN I'LL GO AND FETCH SOME CIGARS SAID RODOLPH RISING
I MUST BEG THE FAVOUR OF YOUR NAME RODOLPH RODOLPH WHAT PLAIN RODOLPH M
HIS LONG FROCK COAT WAS BUTTONED UP TO THE THROAT A LA MILITAIRE
WITH THIS VALUED FRIEND MADAME DURESNEL FOUND A WELCOME HOME WHILE HER WRETCHED HUSBAND FINDING HIMSELF UTTERLY RUINED PLUNGED INTO THE BLACKEST CRIMES AND STOPPED AT NO MEANS HOWEVER GUILTY AND DESPERATE TO SUPPLY HIS PLEASURES
OGRES AND OGRESSES WILL GIVE YOU CREDIT IF IT IS ONLY FOR FEAR
ARE YOU PLEASED WITH WHAT YOU SEE INDEED I AM M
MILITARY EXCLAIMED MADAME PIPELET WITH A CHUCKLE
AND WHAT I DO FOR YOU IS AS MUCH THE DICTATE OF PERSONAL GRATITUDE AS IT IS THE DESIRE TO WITHDRAW FROM POLLUTION A GOOD AND GENEROUS NATURE WHICH HAS BEEN PERVERTED BUT NOT DESTROYED
TO BREAK AND PULL OUT A POOR CHILD'S TEETH IN THAT WAY EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR WITH REDOUBLED FURY
CAN IT BE
THE FATHER OF THIS UNFORTUNATE WOMAN WAS A M
AT THE END OF THIS WINTER GARDEN WERE PLACED IMMENSE DIVANS BENEATH CANOPIES OF LEAVES AND FLOWERS
THE OTHER EPISTLE WRITTEN UPON COARSE AND COMMON PAPER WAS UNITED ONLY BY A COMMON WAFER PRICKED OVER WITH THE POINT OF A PIN AND WAS ADDRESSED TO M
RODOLPH HAS FORGOTTEN ME WHY--I SHALL BE VERY SORRY FOR IT THAT'S ALL I MEANT TO SAY MY GOOD FELLOW THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO RECOMPENSE YOUR SERVICES BUT THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM SO M
HER EYE WAS FIXED HER HEART WAS FULL AND THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE WAS PAINFULLY DISTRESSED
OR WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ME LISTEN SAID RODOLPH RISING FROM HIS SEAT WITH AN AIR OF MENACING AUTHORITY
BUT I NEVER SELL MY FRIENDS
YOU MAY RETURN TO PARIS AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE THE COACHMAN A LITTLE SHORT SQUARE-BUILT MAN WITH HIS HAT OVER HIS EYES AND HIS COUNTENANCE ALMOST ENTIRELY CONCEALED BY THE HIGH COLLAR OF HIS DRIVING-COAT POCKETED THE MONEY WITHOUT A WORD REMOUNTED HIS SEAT GAVE HIS HORSES THE WHIP AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE ALLEE VERTE BY WHICH HE HAD ENTERED
HE IS NOT LIKE PEGRIOTTE WHO ALWAYS PRETENDED TO HAVE A PAIN IN HER SIDE WHEN SHE CAME NEAR ME,--A LITTLE BAGGAGE COME COME AWAY!--BE OFF FINETTE
AND IN HER CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM SHE COMPLAINED WITH DISDAIN AND BITTERNESS OF THE WEAKNESS OF THIS YOUNG MAN WHO TREMBLED BEFORE THE MOST PATERNAL OF GERMAN PRINCES WHO LIVED HOWEVER VERY LONG
LET HIM GO TO THE STAY MASTER OF MINE
YOU HAVE BEATEN HIM AND NO DOUBT HE WILL KILL YOU IF HE CAN HAVE NO FEAR BY JOVE
I WILL ASK THE FATHER TO SPARE HIS DARLING GOOD DAY OLD FRIEND SAID BRAS ROUGE ADDRESSING THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A VOICE WHICH WAS CRACKED SHARP AND SHRILL
THE RED MACAW AND FIG-TREES FROM INDIA
IN VAIN HAS BEEN EVERY INQUIRY MADE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE TOUCHING THE PRESENT RESIDENCE OF FRANCOIS GERMAIN OR THE PROFESSION HE WAS SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW
BRADAMANTI'--HUM!--HUM!--DID I NOT SAY SO ANASTASIA EXACTLY
MAY I GET OUT
HE SQUEAKED LIKE A SUCKING-PIG BUT NOBODY COULD HEAR HIM TWO STEPS OFF
WELL THEN I'LL BEGIN FAN-PAINTER SAID GOUALEUSE WHAT A VERY PRETTY TRADE AND HOW MUCH CAN YOU EARN IF YOU STICK CLOSE TO WORK INQUIRED THE CHOURINEUR
RESEARCHES
THE OGRESS WILL PERHAPS THROW SOMETHING AT YOU,--SHE IS VERY SPITEFUL OH DON'T HEED HER MY GIRL
THE YOUNG FELLOW HAS TOLD US ALL TRUE SO FAR AH
THESE DECLARATIONS OF TOURNEMINE CARRY WITH THEM AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH AND IT SEEMS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT WE MAY THROUGH JACQUES FERRAND OBTAIN THE RIGHT CLUE TO DISCOVERING THE PARENTS OF THIS UNFORTUNATE GIRL
WHEN YOU LEFT MY HOUSE YOU WERE FOLLOWED AND WERE SEEN TO ENTER THERE WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER BUT M
WHEN EVERYTHING WAS COMPLETED THE COMMANDANT CAME TO LOOK AT IT,--JUST TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT ANYTHING MORE HE WANTED
BUT WHAT SORT OF A PERSON WAS YOUR FRIEND TALL SLIM AND WITH HAIR AND MOUSTACHES OF LIGHT CHESTNUT SAID SEYTON
FORMING A SORT OF NATURAL CARPET PRESENTING ONE HARMONIOUS BLENDING OF THE LOVELIEST TINTS
CONDEMNED FOR LIFE YOU HAVE BROKEN AWAY FROM YOUR CONFINEMENT AND BY SEIZING UPON YOU AND PLACING YOU HEREAFTER BEYOND THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING INJURY I SERVE SOCIETY
HOW USED YOUR SUPERIOR STRENGTH O DEATH
BUT DO NOT TURN ME OUT THUS WRETCHED THUS HELPLESS
I WANTED EMPLOYMENT WITH THE BUTCHERS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THAT SORT OF BUSINESS
HIS SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION NECESSARILY SUFFERED FROM THE PREFERENCE GIVEN TO HIS PHYSICAL TRAINING AND RODOLPH'S KNOWLEDGE WAS VERY LIMITED
RODOLPH DO NOT AMUSE YOURSELF BY JESTING WITH A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME
I'M UP TO HIM OR ANY OF HIS DODGES
HE HAS GONE,--ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY LOST THE TWO NEWCOMERS SPOKE IN ENGLISH
IT WAS A JOKE ON YOUR PART I AM SURE,--MERELY DONE IN JEST
AND AS I DID NOT DARE TO SAY SO I FOLLOWED HER WITH ONE FOOT NAKED ON THE BARE STONES
HOW HOT AND HEAVY THEY DID FALL
IT'S ONLY THE CHOUETTE HOW COULD THE MAN WHO WITH THE FEMALE IN DISGUISE SOUGHT ME AT THE TAPIS-FRANC COME INTO CONTACT WITH THESE TWO WRETCHES SAID RODOLPH
WHAT HAPPINESS
AND ESPECIALLY THOSE INFERNAL THWACKS WITH HIS FIST AT LAST
RODOLPH'S FIRST SENSATION UPON ARRIVING AT THIS ENCHANTING TRIUMPH OF ART OVER NATURE WAS THAT OF MOST UNFEIGNED SURPRISE
ENCHANTED AT THIS OFFER THE YOUNG BLACK SET OUT FOR PARIS AND THE PLANTER PAID ALL THE EXPENSES OF HIS COURSE OF STUDY
THAT IS TO SAY SHE GIVES HER TIME HER SLEEP AND HER SERVICES
AH MADAME LA COMTESSE WHO LIKE YOU CAN EFFECT SUCH A UNION OF TASTE AND ELEGANCE AS NOW SPARKLES AROUND US YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS TOO INDULGENT BUT I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK YOU
I CONGRATULATE YOU THAT NATURE DID NOT MAKE YOU ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS CALLED ARTISTS ARTISTS MONSTERS RETURNED RODOLPH
BUT THE BEST THING IS TO SLEEP ALWAYS IN A GOOD BED AND NO MISTAKE
THE CHOUETTE ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION AND RECEIVED BOTH THE CHILD AND THE STIPULATED SUM OF MONEY
YOU MUST SEND ME NEWS OF MARIE VERY OFTEN
THAT IS HE SAYS AN APPEARANCE AT ONCE CONSTRAINED AND REPULSIVE WHICH IT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT
THE CONVERSATION MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED WAS RESUMED
WHAT A PACE THAT STOUT MAN GOES
BEAUTIFUL AND ACCOMPLISHED AN ORPHAN AT SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD LEFT SCOTLAND WITH HER BROTHER THOMAS SEYTON OF HALSBURY
PRAY FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO SAD AND PLEASE NOT TO NOTICE IT
AND MANY MILLIONAIRES MY LORD MIGHT NOT HAVE THE RARE THE ADMIRABLE GOOD SENSE OF THE MAN OF NARROW MEANS AH MY DEAR DE GRAUEN YOU ARE REALLY TOO GOOD MUCH TOO GOOD
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE LEAPS AND EXCLAMATIONS OF JOY THE INTENSE DELIGHT OF FLEUR-DE-MARIE
NEVER MIND I HAD RATHER BE IN MY PLACE THAN HIS
CHOUETTE HAD A MEETING NEAR ST OUEN WITH THE TALL GENTLEMAN IN MOURNING WHO CAME TO ASK FOR YOU AT THE TAPIS-FRANC
THIS PRECAUTION ALONE PROVES THAT SARAH HAD OTHER MATTERS TO TELL HER BROTHER OF BESIDES HER LOVE FOR RODOLPH
NOW I HAVE YOU SAID THE FELLOW
AS TO THE EXPRESSION OF FEROCITY WHICH SUFFUSED THIS HIDEOUS MASK AND THE RESTLESS WILD AND GLARING LOOK MORE LIKE A WILD BEAST THAN A HUMAN BEING IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THEM
SHE SOON BECAME THE IDOL NOT ONLY OF THE GRAND DUKE BUT OF HIS MOTHER THE DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS JUDITH WHO IN SPITE OF OR THROUGH HER NINETY YEARS OF AGE LOVED TO EXCESS EVERY THING THAT WAS YOUNG AND CHARMING
I NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
IN TRUTH THIS SELFISH COLD AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD NOT FELT THE ICE OF HER HEART MELT EVEN BY THE BEAMS OF THE PASSIONATE LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN BREATHED TO HER
A LITTLE ROOM AND WORK ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN YOU,--THOSE ARE POSITIVE NECESSARIES
AS YOU SEE IT THAT BIT OF JEWELRY HAS A VERY GREAT ANTIQUITY,--THREE GENERATIONS
PRESENT MY RESPECTS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS SAID M
I SAY WITHOUT BREAKING FAITH THAT HE IS A SMUGGLER FOR HE MAKES NO SECRET OF IT BUT OWNS IT UNDER THE VERY NOSE OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICERS
UNWILLING HOWEVER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS ADVERSARY THE CHOURINEUR BOILING WITH RAGE RETURNED AGAIN TO THE CHARGE
COME M
THE DWELLING OF THE ITALIAN CHARLATAN WHO WAS SAID TO PURSUE SUCH FEARFUL AVOCATIONS HAD LIKEWISE ITS WHIMSICAL MODE OF DESIGNATING THE PURSUITS OF ITS OCCUPANT WHOSE NAME TRACED IN LARGE LETTERS FORMED OF HORSES TEETH UPON A SQUARE BLACK BOARD WAS NAILED TO THE ENTRANCE-DOOR
TO AVOID THE HONOURS DUE TO HIS SOVEREIGN RANK THE PRINCE HAD PRESERVED HIS INCOGNITO SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN PARIS HIS CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AT THE COURT OF FRANCE HAVING ANNOUNCED THAT HIS MASTER WOULD PAY HIS OFFICIAL AND INDISPENSABLE VISITS UNDER THE NAME AND TITLE OF THE COUNT DE DUREN
A PERVERTED MIND WITHIN AN ATTRACTIVE OUTSIDE ALWAYS INSPIRES ME WITH TWOFOLD DISGUST IN THIS SENSE CECILY IS DOUBLY HATEFUL
THE SURPRISE 90 X
THEY SEIZED HOLD OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE AND SOON BOUND THEM HAND AND FOOT
AT HER AGE IN THE COUNTRY WITH PURE AIR REST AND QUIET SHE WILL SOON BE QUITE RESTORED I HOPE SO
MURPHY AND HIS PUPIL LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN A BEAUTIFUL FARMHOUSE SITUATED IN THE MIDST OF WOODS AND FIELDS SOME LEAGUES FROM THE CAPITAL OF GEROLSTEIN AND IN A MOST PICTURESQUE AND SALUBRIOUS SPOT
BADINOT WHO HAS SEVERAL ACQUAINTANCES IN THE POLICE POINTED HIM OUT TO US AS THE GO-BETWEEN OF SEVERAL NOTORIOUS FELONS AND KNEW THE MAN DIRECTLY HE WAS SET TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE ILL-FATED SON OF MADAME GEORGES DURESNEL THE UNFORTUNATE WIFE OF THIS ATROCIOUS SCHOOLMASTER AND IT WAS IN GOING TO SEARCH FOR BRAS ROUGE IN HIS DEN IN THE CITE RUE AUX FEVES NO
THE WORKING OF HER LIP CEASED AND SHE REPLIED
IF THIS WERE SO HE KNEW THE FATE OF THE SON SHE LAMENTED,--HE POSSESSED TOO SOME PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE BIRTH OF THE GOUALEUSE
I WILL DESIRE MURPHY TO BRING HERE MY MEDICAL MAN,--A NEGRO,--A VERY SKILFUL PERSON WHO WILL TELL YOU THE BEST REGIMEN TO PURSUE
MIND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS YOUNG OR OLD
AND RODOLPH PERCEIVING THE NECESSITY OF DISSIMULATION IMITATED SARAH'S PRUDENCE
SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED AS A MEZZO TERMINI WHICH SHOULD MEET ALL OBJECTIONS A MARRIAGE WHICH ALTHOUGH SECRET SHOULD BE LEGAL AND ONLY AVOWED AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE GRAND DUKE
WELL THERE I WAS AT THE WINDOW OF THE WINE-SHOP CRACKING MY NUTS AND DRINKING MY LIQUOR WHEN THROUGH THE FOG I SAW THE CHOUETTE APPROACH ACCOMPANIED BY BRAS ROUGE'S BRAT LITTLE TORTILLARD
SUDDENLY A MAN SPRINGING UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS HOLLOW SHOOK THE RUBBISH FROM HIM UNDER WHICH HE HAD CONCEALED HIMSELF AND BURST INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER
I CANNOT TELL HOW IT IS WORDS SEEM TO RISE FROM MY LIPS IN SPITE OF MYSELF
GERMAIN
GERMAIN
RODOLPH HAD LISTENED TO THE RECITAL MADE WITH SO PAINFUL A FRANKNESS WITH DEEP INTEREST
AND FROM AMONGST THEM PEEPS OUT THE VILLAGE CHURCH OH HOW BEAUTIFUL,--HOW VERY BEAUTIFUL M
VERY LIKE A CAGED BIRD OBLIGED TO WORK EARLY AND LATE TO EARN TWO FRANCS A DAY AND OFTEN NOT HALF THAT LET HER TRY EVER SO HARD HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT MLLE
YOU SAVED MY LIFE YOU SAVED THE LIFE OF MURPHY THE DEAREST FRIEND I HAVE
THREE HOURS SLEEP OUT OF THE TWENTY-FOUR IS ALL HE ALLOWS HIMSELF,--AND WHAT SLEEP IT IS
I HAD IN THIS AN ADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR LAYING HANDS ON YOU WHEN I HAD DETECTED WHO YOU WERE
VENGEANCE
THE CHAIR IN WHICH THE SCHOOLMASTER REMAINED BOUND SO AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF THE SMALLEST MOVEMENT WAS THEN ROLLED INTO THE ANTEROOM
ARE YOU NOT COLD SARAH PERHAPS WE SHALL GLEAN SOMETHING FROM THIS SMUGGLER,--THIS BRAS ROUGE SAID SARAH IN A THOUGHTFUL TONE AND NOT REPLYING TO HER BROTHER'S INQUIRY
CESAR
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PASS THE DAY IN THE COUNTRY WITH ME MY LASS ASKED RODOLPH
HOWEVER AS I HAD NOT BROKEN MY FAST SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND AS I WAS VERY HUNGRY AT THE RISK OF PUTTING THE CHOUETTE IN A PASSION I TOOK A PIECE OF BARLEY-SUGAR AND BEGAN TO EAT IT WELL DONE GIRL I ATE ANOTHER PIECE BRAVO
I DEFY HIM THEN WILLIS OVERCOME BY FURY AND INTOXICATION SHOOK HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAID IN BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE YES I DEFY GOD TO CARRY OFF MY SLAVES BEFORE THEY ARE DEAD THE MAN WAS MAD AS WELL AS BRUTAL WE WERE UTTERLY DISGUSTED
AT THAT TIME IT WAS A LONG WHILE TO WAIT FOR MY MORSEL OF BREAD
AT THIS DISCOVERY A SUDDEN IDEA FLASHED ACROSS THE MIND OF RODOLPH
CHARLES WAS DESCRIBED AS POSSESSING HAD CAPTIVATED THE SENSES OF MADAME D'HARVILLE WHOM RODOLPH KNEW WELL AS A WOMAN OF DEEP FEELING HIGH INTELLECT AND SUPERIOR TASTE OF AN ELEVATED TURN OF MIND AND A REPUTATION UNSULLIED BY THE FAINTEST BREATH OF SLANDER
BUT I WILL ONLY ALLOW YOU THIS RELAXATION OF PUNISHMENT ON CONDITION THAT YOU GIVE ME THE INFORMATION WHICH I DESIRE TO ACQUIRE
COME ALONG THEN AND LET US HAVE A GLASS OF SOMETHING TOGETHER AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO I AM SAID THE UNKNOWN
13
WHEN WE ARE ONCE IN THE FIELDS I CAN WALK WITH YOU DO NOT BE UNEASY SAID RODOLPH TOUCHED BY THE POOR GIRL'S CONSIDERATION AND TAKING HER ARM AGAIN
IT RAINS CATS AND DOGS
BUT WE ARE FRIENDS FOR LIFE AND DEATH MASTER RODOLPH THOUGH THE DEVIL BURN ME IF I KNOW WHY
WELL THEN I WILL ABANDON THAT IDEA
THEN THEN I SAW RED AND BEGAN TO CUT AND SLASH AWAY ON THESE MEN AS I USED FORMERLY TO DO ON THE HORSES
THE ISLE ADAM 206 XIX
I THREW MYSELF ON MY KNEES AND ASKED HER PARDON FOR HAVING EATEN THE BARLEY-SUGAR
I WAS TAKEN TO THE COMMISSARY RESUMED GOUALEUSE
HE WILL THEN BE OFF AND AFTER THAT I WILL HAVE ONE LITTLE TURN WITH THE CHOUETTE
WOULD IT SIR ADDRESSING THE NEGRO WHOSE ONLY REPLY WAS AN IMPATIENT WAVE OF THE HAND
BUT CONFOUND IT I AM AS STRONG AS A BULL
SIR REPLIED FLEUR-DE-MARIE SORROWFULLY SINCE I WAS BORN THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT EVER HAPPENED TO ME TO RECALL ALL THESE THINGS AT ONCE AND MY TALE IS NOT A MERRY ONE WELL SAID THE CHOURINEUR IRONICALLY YOU ARE SORRY PERHAPS THAT YOU ARE NOT A KITCHEN-WENCH IN A COOK-SHOP OR A SERVANT TO SOME OLD BRUTES WHO THINK OF NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES AH SAID FLEUR-DE-MARIE WITH A DEEP SIGH TO BE QUITE HAPPY WE MUST BE QUITE VIRTUOUS OH WHAT IS YOUR LITTLE HEAD ABOUT NOW EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR WITH A LOUD BURST OF LAUGHTER
HE'S A BOY WITH MORE THAN ONE STRING TO HIS BOW ANSWERED THE OGRESS
AT THE INSTANT WHEN RODOLPH VENTURED INTO THE SMOKY DEN M
IN RETURN FOR WHICH I ONLY KEEP TALKING TO YOU ABOUT ALL THE DULL AND GLOOMY THINGS I CAN THINK OF
HERE IS A BUTCHERY HERE SAID THE CHOURINEUR AS HE LISTENED TO THE BLOWS OF THE CHOPPER WHICH THE BOY WAS USING AND OBSERVED THE QUARTERS OF BEEF THROUGH THE CURTAINS
THEY HAVE RED EYES ADDED THE CHOURINEUR IN A GRAVE TONE AND AS IT WERE WITH A PHYSIOLOGICAL PARENTHESIS
POOH
CABRION
DE LAGNY UNITED BY DESIRE OF HER FATHER
CHAPTER X
NOT A WORD ABOUT MY HAVING PAID YOU HER DEBT WHY NOT WHAT'S THAT TO YOU OH NOTHING
THIS TRIFLING DIGRESSION IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF FACTS OF WHICH WE SHALL SPEAK HEREAFTER
OH I SHA'N'T BE LONG
THE YOUNG GIRL'S COUNTENANCE WAS CALM AND COMPOSED
GERMAIN WAS PERMITTED TO ASSIST THEM ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS WHY SHOULD THEY NOT ACCEPT OF WHAT TRIFLING HELP I CAN AFFORD WHY SIR I SEE NO HARM IN YOUR GOING TO CALL ON THE MORELS BECAUSE IT MAY PLEASE THE POOR THINGS
HOWEVER HE LISTENED TO MY DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS IN AND THEN HE SAID WELL IF THEY ARE SO MUCH DISTRESSED YOU MAY TELL THEM THAT IF THEY WANT ANY TEETH DRAWN I WILL EXCUSE THEM PAYING EVEN FOR THE SIXTH I TELL YOU WHAT MADAME PIPELET SAID RODOLPH I HAVE A DECIDEDLY BAD OPINION OF THIS MAN
BUT FORTUNATELY TOWARDS THE LOWER FALSE RIB OH I MUST HAVE A DEEP AND TERRIBLE REVENGE FOR THIS
HE BECAME PURPLE WITH SHAME LIFTED HIS TWO CLENCHED HANDS TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DEEP GRIEF AND INDIGNATION AND THEN IN A MOMENT AS BY A SUDDEN REVULSION OF FEELING THROWING HIS EYES ON RODOLPH WHOSE NOBLE COUNTENANCE WAS CONVULSED BY THE VIOLENCE OF EXTREME DISDAIN HE SAID IN A FALTERING VOICE AND STIFLING A SIGH OF THE TENDEREST PITY MY LORD BE YOURSELF
HERE ARE MADAME GEORGES AND MARIE
COME I LIKE YOU BETTER NOW YOU SPEAK PLAIN TRUTHS
THAT CRY SAID RODOLPH
THE PASSENGERS TOUCHED BY MY TEARS SOMETIMES GAVE ME A SOU
I HAVE A BIT OF A ROW SOMETIMES AND THEY FEAR ME LIKE FIRE IN THE CITE
SHE PROFFERED TO RODOLPH THE BOUQUET ETCHING BY MERCIER AFTER THE DRAWING BY FRANK T
IT IS SAID THAT INTRIGUERS DISCOVER AND RECOGNISE EACH OTHER BY CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS SIGNS WHICH ALLOW OF THEM OBSERVING EACH OTHER UNTIL THEIR INTERESTS DECIDE THEM TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE OR DECLARE UNREMITTING HOSTILITY
IT NEVER SAW THE SUN IN THE CITE ANY MORE THAN I DID FOR IN OUR STREET IT NEVER DESCENDS LOWER THAN THE ROOF
FAITH I ONLY WISH HE COULD DRUM HIMSELF WELL UPON MY BACK
HE TRIED TO BITE ME BUT COULDN'T
I HAVE NO OCCASION TO WORK ALL THE WEEK AND SO THE REST OF THE TIME I AMUSE MYSELF AND YOUR FAMILY SAID THE GOUALEUSE
PRAY OH PRAY SAY THAT YOU FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING CALLED TO YOUR RECOLLECTION THAT SAD SAD DAY
BUT SINCE THESE POOR MORELS HAVE FALLEN INTO SUCH MISERY AND IT IS QUITE OUT OF OUR POWER TO HELP THEM WHY LET THEM GO AND BE MISERABLE ELSEWHERE
ADIEU MADAME GEORGES
HIS FEATURES GREW LIVID CONTRACTED AND HORRIBLE BENEATH THE BLOOD THAT COVERED THEM
WIDOWER JANUARY 1808 BY DECEASE OF HIS WIFE LOUISA AMELIA DAUGHTER OF JOHN AUGUSTUS PRINCE OF BURGLEN
RODOLPH FREE FROM ALL ETIQUETTE AND EMPLOYED WITH MURPHY IN OUTDOOR LABOUR PROPORTIONATE TO HIS AGE LIVED THE SOBER MANLY AND REGULAR LIFE OF THE COUNTRY HAVING FOR HIS PLEASURE AND AMUSEMENT THE VIOLENT EXERCISES OF WRESTLING PUGILISM RIDING ON HORSEBACK AND HUNTING
WILL YOU STRIKE A BARGAIN
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS ADVANCES WERE REPULSED AND OBSTINATELY RESISTED
THE CHOURINEUR RESOLVED TO INFORM RODOLPH OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED HIM
SOME OTHER TIME PERHAPS WHEN WE MAY MEET AGAIN WHAT
THIS IS NO
TO PAINT FANS
AND IF ANY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WISHES TO HAVE HIS RIBS SMASHED OR HIS NOB IN CHANCERY EVEN INCLUDING THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE SKELETON HERE IS THEIR MAN
RODOLPH UNDERSTAND ME
HARK THE RUFFIAN THEN THRUSTING HIS TONGUE FORCIBLY AGAINST HIS PALATE PRODUCED A SINGULAR NOISE,--A SORT OF GUTTURAL SOUND LOUD AND LENGTHENED SOMETHING LIKE P-R-R-R-R-R-R-R
THE SCENE WE ARE ABOUT TO DESCRIBE TOOK PLACE IN A ROOM HUNG WITH RED AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED
RODOLPH LEFT WITH THE DEEPEST REGRETS THE INDEPENDENT AND ANIMATING LIFE WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO LED WITH MURPHY TO GO AND BECOME PALE WITH THE STUDY OF BOOKS AND SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THE IRKSOME CEREMONIES OF HIS FATHER'S COURT AND HE AT ONCE ENTERTAINED A STRONG PREJUDICE AGAINST HIS TUTOR
HIS PALE CHEEK BECAME SUFFUSED WITH THE RUDDY GLOW OF HEALTH
IT MAY BE SOME PEINE DE COEUR YET IT IS SAID THAT HE IS EXCESSIVELY FOND OF HIS WIFE AND SHE DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE LEAST CAUSE FOR JEALOUSY
SHE NEVER LIKED TO DO WRONG,--SHE WAS SO YOUNG
WELL WELL THIS IS A CONFESSION INDEED IT MAKES YOU SAD MY GIRL TO TELL THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE SAID RODOLPH
I'D LEND IT HIM AS LONG AS HE LIKED
THEY WOULD ONLY SEE ME AND--BUT IF THEY DID EVER LOVE ME WHAT SHAME I SHOULD BRING ON THEM
YOU KNOW WHOM I MEAN,--THE MARTIALS OF THE ILE DE RAVAGEUR WHAT
SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND THOUGH HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER DOES HER BEST TO ASSIST THE FAMILY SHE HAS BUT VERY LITTLE IN HER POWER HOW OLD IS THIS DAUGHTER ABOUT EIGHTEEN AND AS LOVELY A YOUNG CREATURE AS YOU WOULD SEE IN A LONG SUMMER'S DAY
AND LASTLY BETWEEN THE TWO BOXES AND JUST BENEATH A CIRCULAR CLOCK WAS SUSPENDED A PAIR OF RED MOROCCO DRESS-BOOTS SMALL ENOUGH FOR THE FEET OF FAIRIES BUT ELABORATELY AND SKILFULLY DESIGNED AND COMPLETED
YES I WILL PAY YOU BUT IT SHALL BE WITH MY FISTS
BUT THEN A WOMAN WHO SOLD ORANGES CRIED OUT TO THE ONE-EYED WOMAN LOOK YE THERE CHOUETTE
GO AND REPENT
NOTE RELATIVE TO FLEUR-DE-MARIE._--ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1827 A MAN NAMED PIERRE TOURNEMINE THEN UNDER SENTENCE IN THE GALLEYS AT ROCHEFORT FOR FORGERY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN NAMED GERVAIS BUT ALSO KNOWN AS LA CHOUETTE TO TAKE PERPETUAL CHARGE OF A LITTLE GIRL THEN BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX YEARS OF AGE FOR A SUM OF ONE THOUSAND FRANCS PAID DOWN
BADINOT AFFIRMS AND HE IS VERY LIKELY TO BE WELL INFORMED ON THE SUBJECT THAT THE FORTUNE OF THE MARQUIS HAS NEVER BEEN IN A MORE PROSPEROUS CONDITION OR BETTER MANAGED WHY AFTER HAVING IN VAIN EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER CONJECTURE AS TO THE SECRET GRIEF WHICH IS PREYING UPON M
NEVER MIND
HIS BENEVOLENT ANTICIPATIONS WERE GRATIFIED BUT AT WHAT RISK IT IS PAINFUL EVEN TO REMEMBER WHATEVER DANGERS ATTENDED THE SCHEME YOU AT LEAST MY DEAR MURPHY BRAVELY BORE YOUR SHARE IN THEM WAS NOT I FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE APPOINTED CHARCOAL-MAN IN WAITING UPON HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS REPLIED THE SQUIRE SMILINGLY
RODOLPH SMILED DISDAINFULLY
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF FEARFUL SILENCE WHILE THE TWO ATTENDANTS RELIEVED THE SCHOOLMASTER OF HIS GAG AND UNTIED THE CORDS WHICH BOUND HIM TO THE CHAIR
AND THOUGH I FEEL HAPPIER TO-DAY THAN I EVER DID BEFORE IN MY LIFE MY EYES ARE CONTINUALLY FILLING WITH TEARS
OH NO
NO MOTHER PONISSE WE ONLY CAME IN TO TAKE SHELTER FROM THE RAIN SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER AS HE AND THE CHOUETTE WENT OUT
SOME SUDDEN THOUGHT,--DREAD OR FEAR,--FOR WE POOR WOMEN ARE BUT WEAK COWARDLY THINGS SAID THE PORTERESS ASSUMING A TIMID FRIGHTENED MANNER
BRAS ROUGE PAID HIM TWO QUARTERS RENT TO INDUCE HIM TO QUIT THE PLACE FOR UNLUCKILY HE HAD TAKEN HIS APARTMENTS FOR A TERM
LIKE HIS FELLOWS THIS WRETCH WAS AS COWARDLY AS HE WAS FEROCIOUS
OUR THREE ACQUAINTANCES HAD HARDLY DESCENDED THE LAST STEP OF THE STAIRCASE WHEN A CHILD OF ABOUT TEN YEARS OF AGE RICKETY LAME AND SOMEWHAT MISSHAPEN CAME TO REJOIN BRAS ROUGE WHOM HE RESEMBLED IN SO STRIKING A MANNER THAT THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THEM FOR FATHER AND SON
UPON MY LIFE AND SOUL IT IS TOO BAD PRAY MADAME PIPELET DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF SAYING ANY MORE ABOUT IT
THIS IS INDEED A WONDERFULLY BEAUTIFUL CARRYING OUT OF A POETICAL IDEA SAID HE ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY
MR WILLIS A RICH AMERICAN PLANTER SETTLED IN FLORIDA SAID MURPHY HAD DISCOVERED IN ONE OF HIS YOUNG BLACK SLAVES NAMED DAVID WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN THE INFIRMARY ATTACHED TO HIS DWELLING A VERY REMARKABLE DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE COMBINED WITH A CONSTANT AND DEEP COMMISERATION FOR THE SICK POOR TO WHOM HE GAVE WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND CARE THE MEDICINE ORDERED BY THE DOCTORS AND MOREOVER SO STRONG A PREPOSSESSION FOR THE STUDY OF BOTANY AS APPLIED TO MEDICINE THAT WITHOUT ANY TUITION HE HAD COMPOSED AND CLASSIFIED A SORT OF FLORA OF THE PLANTS AROUND THE DWELLING AND THE VICINITY
AND FOR THE SMALL CHARGE OF SIX FRANCS A MONTH YOU SHALL BE TREATED LIKE A PRINCE THEN FOR SIX FRANCS A MONTH I MAY RECKON UPON YOUR VALUABLE SERVICES
GENTLE AS A LAMB IN TEMPER AND DISPOSITION BUT WILLING AS A HORSE TO WORK
AT ANOTHER TIME,--YOU WILL LAUGH AND SAY I AM AMPHIBIOUS EITHER IN FIRE OR WATER WHEN SAVING MEN OR WOMEN,--AT ANOTHER TIME BEING IN GARRISON AT ROUEN ALL THE WOODEN HOUSES IN ONE QUARTER WERE ON FIRE AND BURNING LIKE SO MANY MATCHES
WE HAVE SAID THAT THE DUKE FELT AS MUCH AFFECTION AS GRATITUDE FOR THE OLD MARQUIS D'HARVILLE WHO IN 1815 HAD RENDERED HIM IMMENSE SERVICE
WHERE SHALL WE MEET WE WILL NOT SEPARATE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
YOU WILL SEND FOR THE POLICE M
WE MUST PROFIT BY THE DAYLIGHT WHICH IS LEFT TO US YOU ARE RIGHT MY MAN
COME AND KISS ME AFORE YOU GO AND THE OLD BELDAM OFFERED HER BLOATED LIPS TO FLEUR-DE-MARIE
I WAS ATTACKED AND I DEFENDED MYSELF THE MAN YOU STABBED DID NOT ATTACK YOU,--HE WAS UNARMED
I THOUGHT I HAD THE NIGHTMARE
TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY AMUSEMENT I PLEASED AND TO GO TO THE THEATRES AND OPERA WHENEVER I CHOSE WELL THEN YOU WOULD BE MORE UNREASONABLE THAN I SHOULD
WHY JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE LITTLE PROOF OF HIS VILLAINY THERE WAS HARDLY A SINGLE WIND INSTRUMENT HE DID NOT MAKE USE OF AS A SORT OF ANNOYANCE TO THE LODGERS
HIS DEAREST FRIEND THE MARQUIS D'HARVILLE WHO AS ELSEWHERE STATED HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME LABOURING UNDER A DEEP MELANCHOLY NONE COULD PENETRATE LIVED IN THE VERY PLACE JUST MENTIONED BY MADAME PIPELET
QUICK AS LIGHTNING HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE DAMP SLIPPERY STAIRS
BUT HIS COMPANION QUICKLY PERCEIVING HIS AIR OF DEJECTION AND BLAMING HERSELF FOR HAVING CAUSED IT SAID TIMIDLY
AND I VERILY BELIEVE THAT IF HE HAD THE PROMISE OF OBTAINING ANY FAVOUR HE LIKED TO ASK OF HEAVEN IT WOULD BE THAT THE DAY MIGHT BE MADE DOUBLY AS LONG AS IT NOW IS THAT HE MIGHT EARN BREAD ENOUGH TO STOP THE CRIES OF HIS STARVING BRATS THEN THE FATHER CANNOT EARN ENOUGH IF HE WERE TO TRY EVER SO HARD IT SEEMS WHY THE POOR MAN WAS ILL ABED FOR THREE MONTHS AND THAT THREW THEM ALL BEHIND
THE SCHOOLMASTER TIGHTLY BOUND WITH CORDS AND UNABLE TO MOVE A LIMB WAS PLACED IN A LARGE ARMCHAIR ON CASTERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SALON
I AM FIFTY YEARS OF AGE I AM A GENTLEMAN AND YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHOULD NOT ADDRESS ME IN SUCH A TONE BE SILENT MY LORD BE SILENT
FIRST I PAY TEN SOUS FOR MY NIGHT'S LODGING YOUR PARDON MONSEIGNEUR
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE A VAGUE AND CONFUSED DREAD OF SOMETHING MORE HORRIBLE FAR THAN DEATH ITSELF CROSSED HIS GUILTY MIND,--HE TREMBLED BEFORE THE SUGGESTIONS OF HIS OWN IMAGINATION
WE RETURNED TO OUR BRIG WHICH WAS MOORED A SHORT DISTANCE OFF AND AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN ALL IN THE BUILDING WERE PLUNGED IN PROFOUND SLEEP MONSEIGNEUR WENT ON SHORE WITH EIGHT MEN WELL ARMED AND GOING STRAIGHT TO THE PRISON BURST OPEN THE DOORS AND FREED DAVID AND CECILY
WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE TO INJURE HIM_?--WHENCE COMES HE THUS TO TORTURE ME?--WHERE AM I ASKED THE SCHOOLMASTER IN ALMOST INCOHERENT TONES AND NEARLY FRANTIC WITH TERROR
AND THAT IS NOT ALL--AH IF YOU WOULD PROMISE NOT TO BE ANGRY DO I LOOK AS THOUGH I COULD BE SO UNKIND FLEUR-DE-MARIE AS TO FIND FAULT WITH ANYTHING YOU SAID OH NO INDEED THAT YOU DO NOT
POOR LAMB
A GROOM OF THE CHAMBERS DRESSED IN BLACK AND WEARING A SILVER CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK OPENED THE FOLDING-DOORS AND ANNOUNCED
I'LL GO,--OF COURSE I WILL
BARON
HOWEVER TELLING FORTUNES IS ONLY ONE OF HER MEANS OF GAINING A LIVELIHOOD WHY WHAT DOES SHE DO BESIDES SHE KEEPS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A PAWNBROKER'S SHOP UPON A SMALL SCALE I SEE
ANOTHER HELD HER SCISSORS
I CAN NOW LIVE IN THE CAPITAL WITHOUT FEAR OF THE BEAKS AND I HAVE NEVER PRIGGED,--HAVE I LA GOUALEUSE NO HE WAS NEVER A THIEF SAID THE GIRL
AILS ME
I DIDN'T THINK YOU KNEW HER
THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING TO IDENTIFY THE UNKNOWN OF THE BLUE FIACRE WITH MADAME D'HARVILLE AND YET A THOUSAND VAGUE FEARS AND PAINFUL SUSPICIONS CROSSED HIS MIND
THE PRINCE SAW US AS QUICKLY AND AS PLAINLY AS WE SAW HIM BUT I FRIGHTENED HIM AWAY
ANTINOUS HIMSELF COULD NOT BOAST OF FINER FEATURES OR A MORE CAPTIVATING EXPRESSION MY LORD
WHO LIKES TO BE SEEN WITH A DISCHARGED CRIMINAL
I RECOLLECT HE TOOK THE LODGINGS IN THE JANUARY QUARTER
THEN WE SAW A FEMALE CLOSELY COVERED WITH A BLACK VEIL AND CARRYING A MUFF
JUST A GO OF RATIFI OF THE COLUMN THANKS MOTHER PONISSE BUT I MUST MAKE SURE OF MY GAME
THE MARQUISE AND SARAH HAD RECOGNISED RODOLPH IN THE WINTER GARDEN AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE DESCENDING INTO IT FROM THE GALLERY
RODOLPH SAID GOUALEUSE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE YOU UNDERSTAND I KNOW I FEEL THAT YOU DO THAT I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING TO SAY TO YOU YOUR EMOTION TELLS ME ALL MY CHILD OH SHE FEELS DEEPLY THE GOOD FORTUNE THAT HAS COME TO HER SO PROVIDENTIALLY SAID MADAME GEORGES DEEPLY AFFECTED
SHE BRINGS WITH HER A BOWL OF NEW MILK JUST WARM WHICH SHE PRAYS YOU TO DRINK AS SHE FANCIES YOU ARE DELICATE ABOUT THE LUNGS POOR DEAR CHILD
IN ANOTHER HOUR PERHAPS IT WILL BE TOO LATE
HE CURED MY RHEUMATISM AND I OWE HIM MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE
THERE IS A WAY THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEYTON YOU KNOW THE PLAIN OF ST DENIS I DO DO YOU KNOW WHERE ST OUEN IS YES OPPOSITE ST OUEN AT THE END OF THE ROAD OF LA REVOLTE THE PLAIN IS WIDE AND OPEN
AND I MAY SAY WITHOUT BRAGGING THAT I AM SATISFIED WITH MYSELF MY MAN I OWE MY LIFE TO YOU
AT LAST THEY WERE RESTORED TO LIFE
REMAIN HERE
THEY FELL ON ME AND THEN MY BLOOD WAS UP IN MY EYES AND I WAS ENRAGED IN A MOMENT
WILL YOU GO INTO THAT CHAMBER ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE YOU WILL SEE A LARGE RED POCKETBOOK ON A BUREAU
BUT SO BE IT AND AS I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU FOR A SECOND THOUGHT RODOLPH I WILL PREVENT YOU FROM SHEDDING BLOOD CHAPTER XIII
AND WAS IT FROM THE LIGHTNESS AND FRIVOLITY OF HER CONDUCT THAT THE MIND OF HER EXCELLENT HUSBAND WAS BOWED DOWN BY DOUBTS AND MISGIVINGS
IT WOULD AWAKEN SUSPICION I AM NOT SUCH A FLAT AS THAT YOUNG FELLOW
SHE IS NOT SO BIG AS THE SMALLEST PIECE YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED THE TIMBER-MERCHANT
RODOLPH HE WILL BRING SOME OTHER CRACKSMAN ROBBER WITH HIM AND DO THE TRICK ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
AH MY DEAR CLEMENCE DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME YOU EVER SANG WITH HIM
ARE YOU BLIND
I GOES TO THE OGRESS'S,--NO SCHOOLMASTER
HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY YEARS OF AGE COMFORTABLY FAT WITH A LARGE BROAD COUNTENANCE STRONGLY RESEMBLING IN ITS CAST AND STYLE THE FACES CARVED UPON THE FAR-FAMED NUTCRACKERS OF NUREMBERG
I TOLD HIM I LIVED IN THE RUE MARBOEUF AND THAT I HAD PURSUED COCOTTE FROM GARDEN TO GARDEN AND ENTREATED HIM TO ALLOW ME TO ENTER AND TRY AND FIND THE BIRD AH SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH AN AIR OF PROUD SATISFACTION POINTING TO FINETTE WHAT A WOMAN VERY CLEVER SAID RODOLPH
I HAD NOT SEEN YOU SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN THE WHITE-HAIRED NEGRO HAD PUT OUT THE SCHOOLMASTER'S EYES
AND YOU,--IT AFFECTS YOU MY OLD FRIEND IT DOES MY LORD
THE MORE RESOLVED UPON CLEARING UP HIS DOUBTS IN PROPORTION TO THE VERY GREAT ANNOYANCE HE FELT THAT THE RESIDENCE OF POLIDORI IN THE SAME HOUSE WOULD PROVE TO HIM AND BECOMING MOMENTARILY MORE DISPOSED TO AFFIX A PAINFUL SOLUTION TO THE ENIGMA OF THE PIERCING CRY HE HAD HEARD FROM THE APARTMENTS OF THE ITALIAN RODOLPH BOUND HIMSELF BY A RIGID PROMISE TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER SO AS TO PLACE IT BEYOND THE POWER OF A DOUBT AND FOLLOWED THE PORTER TO THE UPPER FLOOR WHERE WAS SITUATED THE CHAMBER HE WAS DESIROUS OF ENGAGING
A FEMALE
HE WAS VERY PALE AND SAID TO HIS COMPANION IN A GENTLE AND SADDENED VOICE ENOUGH ENOUGH MY OLD FRIEND
BUT GO ON THE TALL MAN AND THE LITTLE LADY IN MEN'S CLOTHES FINDING THAT THEY COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF ME LEFT THE OGRESS'S AND SO DID I
BUT I HAVE NOT YET DONE WITH YOU
RODOLPH HIMSELF TOLD ME I HAD BOTH HEART AND HONOUR BUT WHO THE DEVIL IS THIS M
TALKING OF FAINTING PRAY LET ME BEG OF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE LEAST REGARD FOR YOUR FAN OR ESSENCE-BOTTLE TO BEWARE HOW YOU ALLOW HIM TO HANDLE EITHER FOR HE HAS THE UNFORTUNATE HABIT OF BREAKING WHATEVER HE TOUCHES AND ALL WITH THE MOST FACETIOUS SELF-SATISFIED AIR IMAGINABLE END OF VOLUME I
RODOLPH,--DO PRAY
WHEN SHE REACHED THE CONTINENT SHE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER BROTHER'S ADVICE NOT TO COMMENCE HER CONJUGAL AND REGAL CAMPAIGN UNTIL SHE HAD RESIDED SOME TIME IN PARIS WHERE SHE DETERMINED TO COMPLETE HER EDUCATION AND RUB OFF THE RUST OF HER NATIVE COUNTRY BY ASSOCIATING WITH A SOCIETY WHICH WAS EMBELLISHED BY ALL THAT WAS ELEGANT TASTEFUL AND REFINED
WHY THANKS TO THE TORRENTS THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT IT MUST BE DELICIOUSLY FRESH
WE MET BY CHANCE IN THE ALLEY WHICH LEADS TO BRAS ROUGE'S HOUSE HOSTESS ANOTHER BOTTLE OF THE BEST SAID THOMAS SEYTON
OF COURSE EVERYBODY LIKES TO KNOW ALL THEY CAN
I SAY AGAIN HE IS A MAD DOG,--LET THE PASSENGERS LOOK OUT HE WILL NEVER BITE AGAIN BE ASSURED THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SHUT HIM UP SOMEWHERE NO
CALL FOR SOMETHING TO DRINK THOMAS AND ASK THE PEOPLE HERE ABOUT HIM
THE CHOURINEUR FOLLOWED MURPHY UP THE STAIRCASE
NEVER ABSENT FROM MASS OR VESPERS MAKING HIS EASTER OFFERINGS AND GOING REGULARLY TO CONFESSION
IF EVEN YOU COULD MEET DEATH WITH A MAN'S COURAGE I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU ASCEND THE SCAFFOLD
A DARK AND NARROW ALLEY LED TO A SMALL YARD OR RATHER A SPECIES OF SQUARE WELL OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET IN WIDTH COMPLETELY DESTITUTE OF EITHER AIR OR LIGHT AND SERVING AS A PESTILENTIAL RECEPTACLE FOR ALL THE FILTH THROWN BY THE VARIOUS OCCUPANTS OF THE RESPECTIVE CHAMBERS FROM THE UNGLAZED SASHES WITH WHICH EACH LANDING-PLACE WAS PROVIDED
TO PURSUE WITH UNALTERABLE HATRED WITH IMPLACABLE VENGEANCE VICE INFAMY AND CRIME WHETHER THEY BE TRAMPLING IN THE MUD OR BE CLOTHED IN PURPLE AND FINE LINEN THAT IS JUSTICE
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOUSE AND THE PEOPLE IN IT SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
YOUR PARENTS ADDED RODOLPH
AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE RESUMED
THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO EXPECT OR EVEN DARE TO HOPE FOR NAY FLEUR-DE-MARIE WE SHOULD NEVER FIND FAULT WITH AN OVERSUPPLY OF HAPPINESS AH M
HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY
HE ORDERS I PAY WELL THEN SAID THE OGRESS TURNING TO THE BANDIT WHAT WILL YOU HAVE FOR SUPPER YOU BAD LOT TWO QUARTS OF THE BEST WINE AT TWELVE SOUS THREE CRUSTS OF WHEATEN BREAD AND A HARLEQUIN,"[5 SAID THE CHOURINEUR AFTER CONSIDERING FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHAT HE SHOULD ORDER
ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT THE CAUSE PROCEEDS WHOLLY FROM OUR AMIABLE HOSTESS MADAME L'AMBASSADRICE MAY I REQUEST OF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS TO SOLVE THIS ENIGMA INQUIRED THE COUNTESS SMILING
IF THEY TRY TO ARREST ME AND YOU HAVE LAID ANY TRAP FOR ME I WILL MAKE COLD MEAT OF YOU AND HE GAVE A FIERCE LOOK AT RODOLPH
BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER INSISTED ON SHOWING SO MUCH POLITENESS THAT RODOLPH ENTERED BEFORE HIM
THE DAMPNESS OF THE SOIL HAD SWOLLEN THE WOOD AND JOINED IT HERMETICALLY TO THE WET SLIMY EARTH
JACQUES FERRAND M
HE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE AWAY WITH HIM AND BURY IN THE SHADE HIS LATER CRIMES AND THUS SPARE HIS FAMILY THE NEW OPPROBRIUM
THE DOWN OF EARLY YOUTH GRACED CHEEKS LIGHTLY COLOURED WITH A SCARLET TINGE
YOU DO NOT NOW GO TO THE OGRESS'S NO WHY NOT OH FROM SOME FOOLISH NOTIONS I HAVE HAD VERY WELL
THE ONLY PROOF OF ATTACHMENT AND GRATITUDE I ASK IS TO LEARN TO WRITE AND READ AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN THAT YOU MAY INFORM ME REGULARLY ONCE A WEEK WHAT YOU DO AND TO ADDRESS YOURSELF TO ME DIRECT IF YOU NEED ANY ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE IT IS USELESS TO DESCRIBE THE EXTREME DELIGHT OF THE CHOURINEUR
IF I HAD NOT KEPT A TIGHT HOLD OF HIS WRIST WHICH HELD THE STILETTO I WAS DONE FOR
LET US NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT FOR SERIOUS BUSINESS BRINGS US NOW TOGETHER
I AM TOO HAPPY AND JOY KEEPS ONE WARM
HE HAS HAD MY LETTER MR MURPHY GAVE IT TO HIM WHEN HE CAME THIS MORNING IN THAT LETTER I TOLD OUR GOOD CURE IN A FEW WORDS THE HISTORY OF THIS POOR GIRL
SUPPOSE WE SAY MUSETTE
BE SURE THOUGH THAT THESE WORDS AND THE BLOWS OF THE FIST AT THE END OF MY TUSSLE,--YOU DID LAY EM ON LIKE A GOOD UN,--NOT ALLUDING TO WHAT YOU PAY FOR THE SUPPER AND THE WORDS YOU HAVE SAID--IN A WORD HE EXCLAIMED BLUNTLY AS IF HE COULD NOT FIND LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS MAKE SURE THAT IN LIFE OR DEATH YOU MAY DEPEND ON THE CHOURINEUR RODOLPH UNWILLING TO BETRAY HIS EMOTION REPLIED IN A TONE AS CALM AS HE COULD ASSUME HOW LONG DID YOU GO ON AS AN AMATEUR KNACKER WHY AT FIRST I WAS QUITE SICK OF CUTTING UP OLD WORN-OUT HORSES WHO COULD NOT EVEN KICK
AND UNDER THE DELICATE SKIN OF THIS HAND WHICH GRASPED HIS THROAT WITH SUDDEN FEROCITY THE CHOURINEUR FELT HIMSELF HELD BY NERVES OF IRON
I HAVE DONE WRONG AND I HAVE SUFFERED FOR IT
WELL BUT REMAIN AS YOU ARE AND DO NOT COMPARE YOURSELF TO A COUNTRY MILKWOMAN SAID THE CHOURINEUR
THAT IS MY BUSINESS MY LORD REPLIED MURPHY DESCENDING THE CARRIAGE STEPS
WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH MY BOY
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHICH INTERESTS ME MOST SHE OR MADAME GEORGES
IT IS YOUR FAULT
THE OLD REPROBATE
INDEED INDEED I FEEL AFRAID TO LOOK AT IT,--IT IS SO EXACTLY ALIKE
PIPELET'S ONLY ANSWER
A GLASS OF PLAIN WATER I SAID
AGAIN HE CALLED FOR HELP SHOUTED ALOUD AND ALMOST SCREAMED IN HIS PAIN AND WRETCHEDNESS
IT IS MY ADVICE YOUNG MAN SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER THAT IF MY WIFE INFORMS US THAT THE PERSONS WE WISH TO SEE ARE WITHIN WE HAD BETTER MAKE OUR CALL ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK THAT WILL BE TWO HOURS TOO SOON SAID RODOLPH
DE ST REMY THE MODEL OF OUR YOUNG ELEGANTES WHOSE SPLENDID DOINGS HAVE FILLED ALL PARIS IS ALL BUT RUINED
AND THE ADMIRABLE ORDER IN WHICH THE HOUSE SEEMS KEPT PLEASES ME EXCESSIVELY
ORDERS ARE GIVEN TO THE SON OF THE GAOLER OF THE FORTRESS OF GEROLSTEIN TO CARRY HER OFF AS IF HE WERE ENAMOURED OF HER AND EVERY FACILITY WILL BE GIVEN TO HIM FOR EFFECTING THIS PURPOSE
CHARLES ROBERT IS A MAN OF SURPRISING HONOUR DELICACY AND REAL FEELING
WILL YOU OBLIGE ME WITH A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR SOMEBODY HAS MISTAKEN THE DOOR SAYS MY WIFE
I SUSPECT EVERYBODY,--IN EACH PERSON WHO APPROACHES ME I SEE AN EMISSARY FROM MY PERSECUTOR COME TO REQUEST A LOCK OF MY HAIR
I WILL BE AT YOUR SERVICE IN ONE MOMENT M
AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SHEEP FELT THE KEEN BLADE IT GAVE ONE GENTLE LOW AND PITIFUL BLEAT AND RAISING ITS DYING EYES TO THE CHOURINEUR TWO SPURTS OF BLOOD JETTED FORTH INTO THE FACE OF ITS SLAYER
WHAT FRIGHTENED ME MOST WAS THAT INSTEAD OF SWEARING AND STORMING AS USUAL SHE ONLY KEPT ON GRUMBLING BETWEEN HER TEETH
OF ANOTHER WORLD NOT PEOPLED WITH MASTERS AND SLAVES BUT WITH THE JUST AND THE UNJUST
ENGLISH COUNTRY GENTLEMEN ARE GENERALLY REMARKABLE FOR THEIR ROBUST HEALTH
IN THE MIDST OF THE HEAVY GLOOM AND DEEP SILENCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM HE HEARD STILL THE SAME DULL TRICKLING SOUND HE HAD OBSERVED BEFORE
A CERTAIN DOCTOR CESAR POLIDORI A RENOWNED LINGUIST A DISTINGUISHED CHEMIST LEARNED HISTORIAN AND DEEPLY VERSED IN THE STUDY OF ALL THE EXACT AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THE CHARGE OF CULTIVATING AND IMPROVING THE RICH BUT VIRGIN SOIL SO CAREFULLY AND WELL PREPARED BY MURPHY
IT WILL BE SAID THAT YOU WERE KILLED IN A BRAWL WITH WEAPONS IN YOUR HAND
THE MEN WHO HAD CONVEYED THE SCHOOLMASTER INTO THE CLOSET NOW REPLACED HIM STILL BOUND IN HIS CHAIR ON THE SPOT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED IN RODOLPH'S PRESENCE
WHAT THE WIFE OF DURESNEL THE FELON KNOWN AS THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE MOTHER OF FRANCOIS GERMAIN THE YOUTH WE ARE SEEKING FOR AND WHOM I TRUST WE SHALL FIND IS THE RELATION OF M
THE WINDOWS OF THE GROUND FLOOR CLOSE WITH SHUTTERS HAVING HOOKS BELOW AND STAPLES IN THE UPPER PART
BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER AS THE PROVERB SAYS THEN INTERRUPTING HIMSELF M
HE WANTED TO MURDER ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO TOO
TO TRY AND OVERHEAR WHAT SHE AND THE TALL MAN TALK ABOUT FOR THAT MAY BE USEFUL FOR YOU TO KNOW
I COUNTED ITS LEAVES ITS FLOWERS
HE WOULD BE HER PARTICIPATOR IN ANY AND ALL STRATAGEMS WHICH COULD TEND TO CONSUMMATE THIS END
THERE IS A WOMAN IN THE WAY,--SILENCE OH MY DEAR MADAME PIPELET I MERELY ASKED BECAUSE BEFORE LIVING IN A HOUSE ONE LIKES TO KNOW A LITTLE YES YES
SHALL I AWAIT THE RISING OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TO COMMUNICATE ALL THE PARTICULARS WHICH I HAVE PROCURED NO MY DEAR BARON
WELL NOW AND YOU MY MASTER THIS IS YOUR FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE CITE
AND SEVERELY DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR HAVING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DEVOTION OF MURPHY WHO RICH HONOURED AND ESTEEMED BY ALL WHO KNEW HIM HAD QUITTED A BELOVED WIFE AND CHILD TO ASSIST RODOLPH IN THE BOLD UNDERTAKING HE HAD IMPOSED ON HIMSELF
BEFORE I PULLED THE BELL I HAD PUT MY BONNET IN MY POCKET THAT I MIGHT LOOK LIKE A NEIGHBOUR
THE COURIER SAID MURPHY POINTING TO THE CLOCK
I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE AN INTRUDER,--A SNEAK BROSSEUR AS THE TROOPERS CALL IT
HAD SHE BEEN MERRY AND TALKATIVE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE RETAINED SO HIGH A PLACE IN HIS GOOD OPINION
WILL YOU INDEED I GIVE YOU MY HONOUR THAT FROM THIS VERY HOUR I WILL RESOLVE TO FOLLOW UP YOUR MOST EXCELLENT PLAN AND SAVE FORTY SOUS OUT OF EACH DAY'S PAY ARE YOU QUITE QUITE SURE YOU WILL NAY HAVE I NOT PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL YOU WILL SEE HOW PROUD AND HAPPY YOU WILL BE WITH YOUR FIRST SAVINGS

THE OTHER INMATES OF THE TAPIS-FRANC MEN AND WOMEN PRESENTED NO REMARKABLE CHARACTERISTICS
ONLY I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I OUGHT YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU THINK OR FEEL FLEUR-DE-MARIE WELL THEN I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU WHO IT IS EASILY SEEN ARE ABOVE YOUR CONDITION CAN FREQUENT SUCH LOW CABARETS AS THAT KEPT BY THE OGRESS HAD I NOT DONE SO I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF WANDERING IN THE FIELDS WITH YOU TO-DAY MY DEAR FLEUR-DE-MARIE THAT IS INDEED TRUE M
AT THE FARTHER END WAS A DOOR LEADING TO A KITCHEN
OH POSITIVELY I AM ASHAMED OF YOU PON MY SOUL MY LORD COMPELLED ME TO HAVE SO MANY STRANGE ACQUAINTANCES THAT SUCH A MERE TRIFLE AS THIS SHOULD PASS FOR NOTHING
YOU WILL SEE HOW MY WOMAN WILL WORK
MY HANDS BURN AND I HAVE A SINGING IN MY EARS
RODOLPH AND THE CHOURINEUR WERE LEFT ALONE
HIS FIGURE TALL GRACEFUL AND ADMIRABLY PROPORTIONED YET DID NOT BETOKEN THE ASTONISHING VIGOUR WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED IN HIS RENCOUNTER WITH THE CHOURINEUR
AH WHEN THE SUN SHONE ON THE WALLS OF THE PRISON I COULD NOT HELP SINGING
IF POSSIBLE STRONGER THAN EVER AND YET HE CAUSES HER TO BE SENT TO HIM
AND THEN M
TO SUFFER MISERY AND HUNGER RATHER THAN STEAL IS TO HAVE HEART AND HONOUR SAID RODOLPH GRAVELY
TAKE CARE OF MY PITCHER AND MY PLATE
NOT SO GOOD AS IN PARIS BUT STILL WELL WORTH HAVING
HIS COUNTENANCE HAD UNDERGONE THE SAME CHANGE
SHE EARNS HER WEIGHT IN GOLD AND THAT IS NOT A TRIFLE FOR SHE IS A RARE BUNDLE OF AN OLD BODY
THEY CALL HER RIGOLETTE BECAUSE SHE IS ALWAYS LAUGHING RIGOLETTE
PRAY SPEAK
AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE POLICE THE YOUNG VAGABOND WITH THE HAGGARD VISAGE WHO WAS SMOKING AND DRINKING BRANDY REFILLED HIS PIPE AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE TO THE CHOURINEUR
LOOK AT THOSE PIGEONS
AND I'LL TWIST HER NECK UNTIL SHE TELLS ME THE NAME OF THE PARENTS OF THE POOR GIRL FOR SHE SAYS SHE KNOWS THEM
LE BARON DE GRAUEN MURPHY WITHOUT CEASING FROM HIS EMPLOYMENT RECEIVED THE BARON WITH A NOD AT ONCE CORDIAL AND FAMILIAR
IT RAINED CATS AND DOGS
WELL THAT IS NO CONCERN OF MINE BUT I AM SORRY TOO FOR THE POOR DEAR DECEIVED INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER HE MAY BE
SO WHEN HELMINA HAD TOLD ME ALL ABOUT POOR LORRAINE WHO WAS OBLIGED TO LIE WITH HER NEW-BORN BABE ON STRAW I TOLD HER TO BRING THEM BOTH TO MY ROOM AT ONCE AND I WOULD TAKE A CHAMBER FOR HER NEXT TO MINE
ALL SIN MAY BE FORGIVEN SAID OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR BUT FROM THE TRIBUNAL TO THE SCAFFOLD THE PASSAGE IS TOO SHORT,--TIME AND OPPORTUNITY ARE REQUIRED TO REPENT AND MAKE ATONEMENT
TO GO ON A GOOD NAG TO BUY CATTLE AT FAIRS,--TO RETURN HOME TO ONE'S OWN FIRESIDE TO WARM YOURSELF IF COLD OR DRY YOURSELF IF WET,--TO FIND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER OR A GOOD JOLLY PLUMP WIFE CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT WITH A PARCEL OF CHILDREN TO FEEL IN YOUR POCKETS TO SEE IF YOU HAVE BROUGHT THEM HOME ANYTHING
AND BY ITS LIGHT MIGHT BE SEEN AT THE FAR END OF THE LODGE AS IN COURTESY IT WAS STYLED A BED COVERED WITH A SORT OF PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE EXHIBITING A MINGLED MASS OF EVERY KNOWN COLOUR AND MATERIAL
NOT THAT I WISH TO SPY WHAT THE POOR CREATURES ARE ABOUT GOD KNOWS,--QUITE THE CONTRARY
THESE BOTTLES CONTAINED SUNDRY CORDIALS RED AND GREEN IN COLOUR AND KNOWN BY THE NAMES OF DROPS FOR THE BRAVE RATAFIA OF THE COLUMN ETC ETC
REGRET CABRION SCREAMED THE ASTOUNDED PORTER
NO MATTER
THANKS TO THIS USAGE A VERY COMMON ONE IN THE NORTHERN COURTS A PRINCE MAY TRAVEL WITH AS MUCH LIBERTY AS PLEASURE AND ESCAPE ALL THE BORE OF CEREMONIOUS INTRODUCTIONS
AT LAST OUT SHE COMES PUTS ON HER BONNET SAYS TWO WORDS TO TORTILLARD WHO RETURNS TO HIS HOLE AND THEN CUTS HER STICK I SAY TO MYSELF CAUTION
FAR FROM DESTROYING YOUR SOUL IT SHALL HELP YOU TO SEEK ITS SALVATION
THAT'S MY VIEW OF THE THING AND YOU ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR IN YOUR VIEW
RODOLPH WHO BELIEVES THEY WILL NOT GO TO WORK TILL TO-MORROW IS QUITE OVER-REACHED
LET ME LEAD YOU--THERE YOU CHOURINEUR
BRAS ROUGE TO TURN THE BEGGAR OUT
MIND HOW YOU COME,--IT'S SLIPPERY CHAPTER XIV
WITH THIS FEELING OF YOUR OWN POSITION YOU MUST OFTEN HAVE DESIRED TO END IT YOU MEAN SIR SAID GOUALEUSE INTERRUPTING HER COMPANION
MEANS ASTONISHING
UNABLE TO SCALE THE PERPENDICULAR WALLS OR DOORS THEY AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE VESTMENTS OF RODOLPH WHOSE HORROR AND DISGUST ROSE TO AN INDESCRIBABLE DEGREE AS HE FELT THEIR COLD CLAMMY PAWS AND WET HAIRY BODIES CRAWLING OR CLINGING TO HIM
THIS LIGHTENED MY SORROW A LITTLE THOUGH IT HAD GREATLY INCREASED AT THE LOSS OF MY ROSE-TREE ADDED GOUALEUSE WITH A SIGH
WHAT'S THAT TO YOU SAYS I FIXING ONE OF HIS LEGS BETWEEN MY KNEES AND GRASPING HIS FIN WITH MY OTHER HAND
AND THEN TOO I SAW HIM KEEP HIS HAND ALWAYS UNDER THE TABLE IT'S LUCKY FOR THE SCHOOLMASTER AND GROS-BOITEUX THAT THEY WERE NOT HERE SAID THE OGRESS
AND WHAT IS THIS POOR MOREL'S TRADE A MAKER OF FALSE JEWELRY
AND HOW SHOULD WE PASS THOSE WHY YOU WOULD PUT ON YOUR HOLIDAY DRESS WITH ONE OF THOSE PRETTY LITTLE CAPS A LA PAYSANNE WHICH ALL ADMIT YOU LOOK SO VERY NICELY IN AND ACCOMPANY YOUR AUNT IN HER LARGE OLD-FASHIONED CHAISE DRIVEN BY JAMES THE FARM SERVANT TO HEAR MASS IN THE VILLAGE CHURCH
HIS FACE WAS BROAD OPEN AND RUDDY AND FREE FROM ALL APPEARANCE OF HAIR EXCEPT VERY SHORT WHISKERS OF A REDDISH COLOUR ONLY REACHING AS LOW AS THE TIP OF THE EAR FROM WHICH IT DIVERGED AND STRETCHED ITSELF IN A GENTLE CURVE ACROSS HIS RUBICUND CHEEKS
BY ALL THAT'S UGLY WHAT A RATTLING YOU MADE ESPECIALLY WITH THESE BLOWS WITH WHICH YOU DOUBLED ME UP
AND TELL ME WHAT TO BELIEVE CALM YOURSELF MY DEAR CHILD
AND WHEN I THINK THAT I AM GOING TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY AND KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE WHO ONLY EARN THE HALF OR EVEN LESS WILL YOU COME UP AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE WITH ALL MY HEART M
RODOLPH REPLIED THE GIRL DRYING HER EYES AND TRYING TO SMILE
OH FOR WHAT CAN YOU REQUIRE ME TO PARDON YOU FOR NOT HAVING SOONER TOLD YOU THAT YOU NO LONGER OWE THE OGRESS ANYTHING
AND TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS BOUND TO A STAKE HIS SKIN WAS TORN WITH THE LASH WHILST THEY BORE CECILY TO THE HAREM OF THE PLANTER IN HIS SIGHT THE CONDUCT OF THE PLANTER WAS BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE
FOR AS ALFRED SAYS HIMSELF THAT FOR A BRIBE OF GOOD THICK TRIPE HE WOULD BETRAY FRANCE ITSELF,--HIS BELOVED FRANCE
HE SMILED A MELANCHOLY WELCOME AND HIS COUNTENANCE AND LANGUID AIR MARKED A MAN OF SECRET SORROW
MAY GOD GRANT THAT YOU TURN IT TO THE RIGHT PURPOSE THE SCHOOLMASTER REMAINED UTTERLY BEWILDERED
COME
WELL DAVID WELL AND HOW IS MURPHY HE SLEEPS MY LORD SAID THE DOCTOR DESPONDINGLY
HE DID NOT TAKE HIS EYES OFF THEM
IT MAKES MY HEART QUITE COLD TO THINK OF THE POOR LITTLE THING TROTTING ALONG BESIDE THAT CURSED OLD BRUTE WITH HER POOR LITTLE FOOT ALL BLOODY WE LIVED IN A GARRET IN THE RUE DE LA MONTELLERIE
NO NEVER
WHAT DO YOU THINK SIR WALTER MURPHY ANY OF YOUR CITE ACQUAINTANCES WOULD SAY AT SEEING YOU SO STRANGELY DISGUISED AS AT PRESENT THEY WOULD CONSIDER YOU MOST VALIANT CHARCOAL-MAN TO BE
DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A SPY WITH YOUR QUESTIONS
THOUGH IN A MORAL SENSE HIS RESOLUTE AIR AND WHAT WE MAY TERM HIS BOLD SERENITY PLACED AN IMMENSE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM
I COULD HAVE KICKED MYSELF FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE OUT WHAT THE CHOUETTE WAS UP TO
TO THIS MAN WAS MLLE
MONSEIGNEUR DID NOT SAY A WORD AND WE LEFT THE CELL
IS'T YOU BRAS ROUGE
LOOK
NAY BARON I CANNOT ALLOW MYSELF TO REMAIN IN YOUR DEBT
IN SPITE OF THE CLOSE LOOKOUT OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE ONE-EYED HAG RODOLPH WHO WALKED BEFORE THE HIDEOUS PAIR EXCHANGED A RAPID AND UNPERCEIVED GLANCE WITH MURPHY AS HE GOT INTO THE HACKNEY-COACH
WHAT'S THE USE OF BEING AN HONEST MAN AND HAVING GRAY HAIRS IF IT DOES NOT ENABLE US TO ENDURE REPROACHES WHICH WE DO NOT DESERVE BE IT SO BE IT SO
HE WAS FORMERLY A LAWYER BUT COMPELLED TO QUIT HIS PROFESSION FROM SOME VERY SERIOUS BREACH OF TRUST
THE STABBER OR SLASHER
IN THE MORNING WHEN I GO TO BUY MY MILK FROM THE MILKWOMAN AT THE CORNER OF RUE DE LA VIEILLE-DRAPERIE WITH THE SOUS WHICH THE OGRESS GIVES ME AND SEE HER GO AWAY IN HER LITTLE CART DRAWN BY HER DONKEY I DO ENVY HER SO AND I SAY TO MYSELF SHE IS GOING INTO THE COUNTRY TO THE PURE AIR TO HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND THEN I RETURN ALONE INTO THE GARRET OF THE OGRESS WHERE YOU CANNOT SEE PLAINLY EVEN AT NOONDAY WELL CHILD BE GOOD--LAUGH AT YOUR TROUBLES--BE GOOD SAID THE CHOURINEUR
AND WHILE THESE SAD PRESAGES FILLED HIS MIND A POWERFUL IMPRESSION WHISPERED WITHIN HIM THAT THE DREADFUL DOINGS ASCRIBED TO THE ITALIAN WERE NOT ALTOGETHER UNFOUNDED
THE CHOURINEUR RECOMMENCED HIS EVOLUTIONS SYLPHIDIQUES AND RETURNED WITH THE ARTICLE REQUIRED
AT THE MONTH'S END I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
I WOULD RATHER FAST AND GO BAREFOOT ANY DAY THAN BE WITHOUT MY DROPS FOR MY THROTTLE AND THE WEED FOR MY PIPE SAID THE RAPSCALLION IN A THICK LOW HOARSE VOICE WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS SEAT AND PUFFING OUT VOLUMES OF TOBACCO-SMOKE
I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO TREAT WITH ABOUT HIRING APARTMENTS
THEN SHE ADDED POINTING TO THE CHOURINEUR IF WE ASK THIS MAN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT RODOLPH PERHAPS HE MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM WE CAN BUT TRY REPLIED THOMAS WHO SAID TO THE CHOURINEUR COMRADE WE EXPECTED TO FIND IN THIS CABARET A FRIEND OF OURS
AND SINCE THEN ALL MY ENTREATIES MY PRAYERS AND LETTERS HAVE BEEN IN VAIN
THESE WERE IN TENS AND DOZENS AND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS EACH WAITING HIS TURN IN A KIND OF SLAUGHTER-HOUSE LIKE THE HORSES WHOSE THROATS I USED TO CUT AT MONTFAUCON AWAITING EACH HIS TURN
SHE HASN'T A FARDEN'S WORTH OF STRENGTH,--SHE CAN'T STAND EVEN TWO THUMPS AND THEN SHE CALLED ME PEGRIOTTE LITTLE THIEF I NEVER HAD ANY OTHER NAME,--THAT WAS MY BAPTISMAL NAME LIKE ME
WHILST SOME EXAMINATIONS ARRANGED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND RODOLPH WHICH HAD THE AIR OF BEING IMPROMPTU QUESTIONS CONFIRMED THE GRAND DUKE IN HIS BLIND AND IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE
GERMAIN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU
OUR CONDUCT WAS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY I KNOW
NO MORE ALMOST SHRIEKED MADAME D'HARVILLE INTERRUPTING SARAH
I LIKE IT BETTER AND SO DO I,--IT COMES SO MUCH EASIER TO ONE
THE DUKE IS SUFFICIENTLY DISAGREEABLE FOR YOU TO GENERALISE THE REGRET HIS UNEXPECTED PRESENCE OCCASIONS I DO NOT SLANDER I MERELY REPEAT
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TUMULT THE CHARCOAL-SELLER OF WHOM WE HAVE SPOKEN ADVANCED TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE TAPIS-FRANC AND MEETING THE EYE OF RODOLPH HE PUT TO HIS LIPS THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND
THE RATS STILL PURSUED BY THE FAST-GATHERING WATERS FINDING NO OTHER MEANS OF ESCAPE SOUGHT REFUGE FROM ONE STEP TO ANOTHER ASCENDING AS FAST AS THE RISING FLOOD RENDERED THEIR POSITION UNTENABLE
I SHALL HAVE MIZZLED A SUDDEN IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE SARAH AND SHE SAID TO THE BRIGAND WILL YOU LIKE TO GAIN SOME MONEY YES DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT--FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN--THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL-MAN CAME TO SEEK A DANDY WITH MOUSTACHES
SARAH WAS PERFECTLY INSENSIBLE TO A RECEPTION SO KIND AND GENEROUS,--TO THE FULL CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH SHE WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE VERY HEART OF THIS SOVEREIGN FAMILY
FROM THE RARENESS OF THE GRAND DUKE'S VISITS TO THE HAUT MONDE HIS ARRIVAL PRODUCED A GREAT SENSATION AND EVERY EYE WAS FIXED UPON HIM FROM THE MOMENT THAT ATTENDED BY MURPHY AND BARON DE GRAUEN HE ENTERED THE FIRST SALON AT THE EMBASSY
THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE SOON EQUALLY BELOVED FETED AND ADMIRED IN THIS COURT
BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT IF WE DO NOT AT ONCE SEVER OUR CONNECTIONS WITH CORRUPT MINDS IN DISGUST BY DEGREES AND IN SPITE OF OUR BETTER REASON WE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH AND TOO FREQUENTLY ADMIRE THEM UNTIL INSENSIBLY WE HEAR WITHOUT SHAME OR REPROACH THOSE THINGS MOCKED AT AND VITUPERATED WHICH WE FORMERLY LOVED AND REVERED
IT IS DROLL BUT IF I HAD THE MEANS A BUTCHER'S IS THE TRADE IN WHICH I SHOULD SET UP FOR I LIKE IT
HAVING PAID AND DISMISSED THE POSTMAN RODOLPH MECHANICALLY EXAMINED THE TWO LETTERS THUS COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE
YOU WHO HAVE DENIED ALL HOPE AND MERCY TO SO MANY UNHAPPY BEINGS
POOR WRETCHED TREMBLING CRAVEN
ANSELM DURESNEL YOU HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE BAGNE AT ROCHEFORT WHERE YOU WERE CONDEMNED FOR LIFE FOR FORGERY ROBBERY AND MURDER IT'S FALSE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A HOLLOW VOICE AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM WITH HIS RESTLESS AND GLARING GLANCE
THE CHOURINEUR ON THE CONTRARY WAS QUITE IN HIGH SPIRITS
I DARE NOT HOPE IT
AND AS THE EVENINGS BEGIN TO BE A LITTLE CHILL A BRIGHT CHEERFUL FIRE IS BLAZING IN THE LARGE FARM KITCHEN
NOT DESIRING HOWEVER THAT HIS THOUGHTS SHOULD BE DETECTED HE SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER AND BY WAY OF SEEMING AT HIS EASE CALLED FOR A GLASS OF SOMETHING
BUT IF BY CHANCE ANY SHOULD COME PLEASE TO GIVE THEM TO MLLE
THIS EXALTED FLIGHT OF AMBITION STUPEFIED THE DOCTOR WHO HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT SARAH'S IMAGINATION SOARED SO HIGH
PRAY LET ME ADVISE YOU TO BE WISER COME THEN MY SAGE LITTLE MONITRESS I WILL BE A GOOD BOY AND LISTEN TO ALL YOUR CAREFUL ADVICE
IT ENCRUSTS THE BODY WITH A COLD ICY COVERING WHICH ALIKE RESISTS THE INROADS OF BODILY OR MENTAL WEAR AND TEAR
THE SCHOOLMASTER ENTERED THE GARDEN AND I INSTANTLY COMING DOWN FROM THE TREE FELL ON THE CHOUETTE
WELL I WENT BANG HEADS OR TAILS AT IT HITTING THE SCHOOLMASTER ON THE SHOULDER WHICH WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD AT THE MOMENT TOUCH
HE IS NOW OUT OF DANGER SAVED
BUT MAKE HASTE ABOUT IT
DO YOU WANT TO MAIM YOURSELF FOR LIFE LAME MYSELF ASKED THE EAGER NURSE
AND THEY AGREED TO MEET AGAIN ON THE MORROW THAT'S TO-DAY SAID RODOLPH
HAPPILY YOU HAVE KEPT YOURSELF HONEST AMIDST ALL THE EVIL EXAMPLE OTHERS HAVE SET YOU AY AND EVEN BORE THE TAUNTS AND JESTS YOU USED TO HEAP UPON ME BECAUSE I WOULD NOT TURN PRIG LIKE YOURSELF ALAS
GOD BLESS YOU HE HAS ALWAYS OVERWORKED HIMSELF
HIS NEW BLOUSE OPEN ON HIS CHEST SHOWED A RED WOOLLEN SHIRT CLOSED BY SEVERAL SILVER BUTTONS
COME HOLD TIGHT BY ME
WE SHALL SEE BY AND BY AND DOES HE NOT SEEM ASHAMED OF THE PART HE PLAYS ON THE CONTRARY HE IS NOT A LITTLE VAIN OF HIS EMPLOYMENT AND WHEN HE BRINGS ME ANY PARTICULARS ASSUMES A CERTAIN AIR OF IMPORTANCE HE WOULD FAIN PASS OFF AS DUE TO HIS DIPLOMATIC FUNCTIONS
HIS COMPLEXION HAD THAT LIVID HUE PECULIAR TO THE NEGRO COUNTENANCE WHILE HIS LIPS WERE ASHY PALE
BUT SHE IS SO NICE AND SO KIND SHE WENT INTO THE COUNTRY ONLY TO PLEASE ME AND YOU DID NOT EVEN LEAVE YOURSELF A FEW SOUS TO LIVE UPON WHILST YOU FOUND WORK SAID THE CHOURINEUR
RODOLPH HIMSELF WAS PENSIVE
AWKWARD DEVIL EXCLAIMED THE NEGRO IMPATIENTLY
DON'T BE ALARMED MY CHILD HE WON'T COME
THEN BY A MOVEMENT MORE RAPID THAN THOUGHT ITSELF HE RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND VIOLENTLY PULLED THE BELL
SHORT AS HAD BEEN THE PERIOD OF THIS APPARITION'S VISIT HE HAD YET IN THOSE BRIEF INSTANTS RECALLED FEATURES PRECISELY SIMILAR AND FOR EVER ENGRAVED ON HIS MEMORY,--THE EYES SHINING WITH THE COLOUR AND BRILLIANCY OF THE AQUA MARINA BENEATH THEIR BUSHY SANDY EYEBROWS THE LIVID COMPLEXION THE NOSE THIN PROJECTING AND CURVING LIKE AN EAGLE'S BEAK WITH ITS NOSTRILS SO CURIOUSLY EXPANDED AND CARVED OUT TILL THEY EXPOSED A PORTION OF THE NASAL CARTILAGE RESEMBLED CLOSELY A CERTAIN POLIDORI WHOSE NAME HAD BEEN SO UNCEREMONIOUSLY COMMITTED BY MURPHY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH GRAUEN TO REGIONS NOT MENTIONABLE TO POLITE EARS
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS VOLUME 1 OF 6 BY EUGENE SUE
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I LEARNED SOMETHING THEN WHICH I SHALL NOT EASILY FORGET
THEY HAVE WORRIED MY POOR OLD DEAR ALMOST OUT OF HIS SENSES AND MADE HIM HALF STUPEFIED AS YOU SEE HIM NOW THEN SPEAKING LOUD SHE ADDED IN A CARESSING TONE OH NEVER MIND THE BLACKGUARD THERE'S A DEAR BUT TRY AND FORGET ALL ABOUT IT OR YOU WILL BE ILL AND UNABLE TO EAT THE NICE TRIPE I HAVE GOT FOR YOUR DINNER LET US HOPE I SHALL HAVE COURAGE AND FIRMNESS ENOUGH FOR ALL THINGS REPLIED M
BUT FOR YOU I SHOULD HAVE STIFFENED MY MAN AND WALKED OFF WITH HIS MONEY
I WAS VERY COMFORTABLY SEATED AND KEPT MY EYE ON THE DOOR
FLEUR-DE-MARIE WHOSE UTMOST EFFORTS WERE UNAVAILING TO SHAKE OFF THE PAINFUL SENSATIONS SHE EXPERIENCED REMAINED SO SILENT AND MOURNFUL THAT RODOLPH REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH HAVING BY HIS WELL-INTENTIONED SURPRISE BEEN THE CAUSE OF IT
WE WILL NOT FARTHER DELAY THE READER BY DESCRIBING THE PERFECTION OF HER FIGURE NOR DWELL UPON THE DISTINGUISHED AIR WHICH MARKED HER WHOLE APPEARANCE
OUR FRESH AND HALE BEAUTIES OF THE NORTH HAVE NOT A MORE TRANSPARENT COMPLEXION NOR A SKIN OF MORE DAZZLING WHITENESS I WAS IN FRANCE WHEN MONSEIGNEUR RETURNED FROM AMERICA ACCOMPANIED BY DAVID AND CECILY AND I KNOW THAT THAT EXCELLENT MAN WAS FROM THAT TIME ATTACHED TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS BY TIES OF THE STRONGEST GRATITUDE
THE RENDEZVOUS 137 XIII
A YEAR PASSED AWAY IN THIS MANNER
BADINOT FOR SUCH IS THE NAME OF THE PERSON I AM SPEAKING OF IS A SHARP SHREWD INDIVIDUAL HAVING CONNECTIONS EITHER RECOGNISED OR CONCEALED IN EVERY GRADE OF SOCIETY
ON REACHING THE END OF THE STREET I FOUND IT WAS RAINING PITCHFORKS POINTS DOWNWARD,--A COMPLETE DELUGE
HIS COOLNESS DECEIVED THE SCHOOLMASTER
BUT I SHALL ONLY BRING A COUPLE OF GLASSES FOR ALFRED AND I ALWAYS DRINK OUT OF THE SAME GLASS
HOW COULD A MAN LIKE MYSELF EVER AMASS SO MUCH WHY M
MR WILLIS WAS DESPERATELY ENRAGED AND TELLING HIM HE WAS A CONTUMACIOUS SLAVE THREATENED HIM WITH THE CHAIN
WELL THEN I CARRIED IT TO THE QUAY THINKING THAT TO BE WITH OTHER FLOWERS IN THE FRESH AND BALMY AIR WOULD DO IT GOOD
IF IT IS A TRAP IT IS NOT YET BAITED
WHERE IS THE SCHOOLMASTER MY GOOD FELLOW IN ANOTHER ROOM WITH THE CHOUETTE
IT WOULD MAKE THE HAIR OF YOUR HEAD STAND ON END
HIS SISTER COULD NOT LONGER ENDURE THE CRUEL ANGUISH OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF SHE MUST RENOUNCE RODOLPH'S LOVE SHE MUST ACT UP TO HER PAINFUL RESOLVE AS PROMPTLY AS MIGHT BE
DE GRAUEN
I WILL PUT IT IN THE LETTER-BOOT RODOLPH FANCIED HE HAD NOT CAUGHT THE RIGHT WORDS BUT TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE SAW MADAME PIPELET GRAVELY THROW THE LETTER ALLUDED TO INTO AN OLD TOP-BOOT HANGING UP AGAINST THE WALL
HE LIVED IN ONE OF THE LARGEST MANSIONS IN THE FAUBOURG ST GERMAIN SITUATED AT THE END OF THE RUE PLUMET AND THE BOULEVARD DES INVALIDES
FLATMAN THE BERTRAND OF GERMANY PERFECTED YOU IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF FENCING
THIS LAD REPLIED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHO WAS THE NEW PROPRIETOR FOR HE HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY THROUGH AN AGENT
AM I A GOOD PAINTER OR NOT LA GOUALEUSE LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SURPRISE IN WHICH A DEGREE OF UNEASINESS WAS MINGLED
VIVE LA CHARTE THOSE ARE MY BLOWS,--I KNOW THEM CRIED THE CHOURINEUR
HE IS USUALLY AT HIS ESTAMINET IN THE CHAMPS ELYSEES
BUT SINCE EVEN THIS CONJECTURE HAS FAILED HE MUST ABANDON ALL HOPE OF GUESSING THE ENIGMA
HIS GLANCE HAD EVEN A SAVAGE GLARE IN IT
BUT WHO AND WHAT ARE YOU
THEN THROWING HIMSELF INTO AN ARMCHAIR HE LEANED HIS HEAD UPON HIS CLASPED HANDS AND APPEARED LOST IN DEEP REFLECTION
FOR SHE SHOWS AS MUCH PERTINACITY IN PURSUING HIM AS HE EVINCES RESOLUTION TO AVOID HER ONLY IMAGINE HER DISGUISING HERSELF IN MALE ATTIRE AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO THE CITE
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
THE POOR GIRL WAS ENDEAVOURING THOUGH FRUITLESSLY TO CHOKE THE DEEP SOBS WHICH ALMOST SUFFOCATED HER
A THIEF I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN PRISON AND RIGHT WELL TOO
WHY A FEW MONTHS AGO I MEAN ABOUT HIS FIRST ARRIVAL HERE YOU WERE SO CAPTIVATED BY HIM THAT BETWEEN OURSELVES I WAS HALF AFRAID YOU HAD LOST YOUR HEART PAST ALL HOPE OF RECALL THANKS TO YOU REPLIED MADAME D'HARVILLE SMILING MY ADMIRATION WAS VERY SHORT-LIVED
FOR AFTER HAVING HAD A WEEK'S AMUSEMENT TOGETHER SHE SAID TO ME NOW WE HAVE HAD SUCH A HOLIDAY WE OUGHT TO TRY FOR WORK AND NOT SPEND OUR MONEY IN WASTE I WHO WAS SO HAPPY IN THE FIELDS AND THE WOODS,--IT WAS JUST AT THE END OF SPRING THIS YEAR,--I ANSWERED OH I MUST BE IDLE A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN I WILL WORK HARD SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE NOT SEEN RIGOLETTE BUT I HEARD A FEW DAYS SINCE THAT SHE WAS LIVING NEAR THE TEMPLE,--THAT SHE WAS A FAMOUS NEEDLEWOMAN AND EARNED AT LEAST TWENTY-FIVE SOUS A-DAY AND HAS A SMALL WORKROOM OF HER OWN
AND BY HIS SIDE WAS A CHASSEUR WHOSE FIERCE-LOOKING MOUSTACHES GAILY EMBROIDERED DRESS AND HAT HALF CONCEALED BY A WAVING PLUME OF BLUE AND YELLOW FEATHERS COMPLETED A MOST IMPOSING COUP-D'OEIL
I NEVER FELT SO STRONG
AFTER A FEW MINUTES SHE CAME DOWN AGAIN
WHY YES
RODOLPH FOLLOWED HIM AND LEANED ON ONE OF THE WINGS OF THE DOOR WHICH HE CLOSED
IT WAS AFTER I BEGAN TO SING SO MUCH THAT THEY CALLED ME GOUALEUSE INSTEAD OF PEGRIOTTE
HE WAS CHEERFUL AND MERRY AS NEED BE BUT THEN HE ALWAYS KEPT HIS HIGH SPIRITS WITHIN PROPER BOUNDS INSTEAD OF WORRYING PEOPLE TO DEATH BY HIS UNMEANING HOAXES LIKE THAT CABRION WHO I WISH WAS AT THE DEVIL COME COME MY GOOD M
SO THEN OURS IS SIMPLY A MERE ROBBERY WITH FORCIBLE ENTRY NOTHING MORE THAT'S VERY SILLY AND CONTEMPTIBLE
SHE DRESSED IN A SMART LITTLE CAP AND A GOWN THAT COST PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN TWENTY-FIVE SOUS THE ELL BUT MADE BY HERSELF AND THAT SO TASTILY THAT IT BECAME HER AS MUCH AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OF SATIN
HE MUST BE A VILLAIN AND SUPPOSE IT HAD FALLEN INTO YOUR HUSBAND'S HANDS MADAME PIPELET OH FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T MENTION THAT OR I SHALL FAINT AWAY IN YOUR ARMS
HAVING SUBDUED HER FEELING OF FRIGHT THE OLD HAG EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF HORRIBLE FLATTERY
BADINOT PRAY LET ME HEAR THEM
AND IF IT COULD BE MANAGED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY ALWAYS
BUT YOU ARE WRONG AND IF YOU LIKE I WILL TELL YOU MY HISTORY
MY GOOD MURPHY SAID HE LEAVE US TOGETHER AWHILE CHAPTER XIX
RODOLPH MUST LEAVE THE HANDS OF WOMEN
BUT THE AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD SOUGHT THIS DISPLAY IN ORDER TO COMPEL RODOLPH TO DECLARE HIS MARRIAGE
I SILENCED HER WITH TWO BLOWS OF MY FIST,--MY NEW STYLE,--AND SHE FELL WITHOUT A WORD
MONSEIGNEUR AWAKENED THE MAN WHO SAT UPRIGHT IN HIS BED HIS BRAIN STILL DISTURBED BY THE EFFECT OF HIS DRUNKENNESS
AND THE MORE PARTICULARLY AS PERHAPS M
THEY ASKED MY NAME MY AGE AND MY PAPERS
A WALNUT-TREE TABLE GRACED THE SIDE OF THE ROOM BEARING A VARIETY OF ARTICLES SUITED TO THE TASTE AND ORNAMENTAL NOTIONS OF ITS OWNERS
SOMETIMES
A FIERCE STRUGGLE ENSUED
ON THE LEFT RESUMED THE CHOUETTE NEAR THE COURTYARD IS A WELL
AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WERE GROUPED THE PALM AND DATE-TREES OF THE LEVANT
I SAID RODOLPH
THERE IS SOMETHING IN IT TO EVERYBODY'S TASTE
SO I TOOK OFF MY BLOUSE AND MY NECK-HANDKERCHIEF I WENT TO THE DITCH WHERE TORTILLARD LAY AND TAKING THE YOUNG DEVIL'S KIN BY THE CUFF OF HIS NECK,--HOW HE DID WRIGGLE AND TWIST AND SCUFFLE AND SCRATCH!--I PUT HIM INTO MY BLOUSE TYING UP ONE END WITH THE SLEEVES AND THE BOTTOM TIGHTLY WITH MY CRAVAT
MERRILL THE CLEAR AND WHITE COMPLEXION OF FLEUR-DE-MARIE GENERALLY RATHER PALE WAS NOW HEIGHTENED BY THE BRIGHTEST COLOUR
IT WOULD BE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK TO DESCRIBE HER LARGE DARK GRAY EYES FRINGED WITH THEIR THICK LASHES AND BEAMING WITH ANGELIC SWEETNESS
NICCOLLS CO
THE SCHOOLMASTER IS CUNNING HE MAY SUSPECT A TRAP
A TRAGIC INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH BROUGHT THESE THREE PERSONAGES TO A RECOLLECTION OF THE SPOT IN WHICH THEY WERE
FOR ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY TO THE SCENE OF YESTERDAY I HAD FREQUENTLY SEEN HIM I HAD SCARCELY EVER SPOKEN TO HIM
YES THE DEAR OLD PET WOULD CHANGE HIS COUNTRY FOR SUCH FINE FAT TRIPE AS THIS HE WOULD WHILE MADAME PIPELET WAS THUS DELIVERING HER DOMESTIC HARANGUE UPON THE VIRTUES OF TRIPE AND THE POWERFUL INFLUENCE IT POSSESSED OVER EVEN THE PATRIOTISM OF HER HUSBAND RODOLPH WAS BURIED IN THE DEEPEST AND MOST SOMBRE REFLECTIONS
AND IF SHE RETURNS THAT WILL SPOIL ALL
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SIR ASKED SHE AT LENGTH
RIGOLETTE REMEMBERING WITH DEEP INTEREST ALL HE HAD HEARD OF HER BEING THE FAVOURITE COMPANION OF THE POOR GOUALEUSE AND RECALLING ALSO THE INFORMATION SHE WAS SAID TO POSSESS TOUCHING THE RESIDENCE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER'S SON WHEN THE SOUND OF SOME PERSON QUITTING THE APARTMENTS OF THE QUACK DOCTOR BELOW ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AND HE COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR THE LIGHT STEP OF A FEMALE WITH THE RUSTLING OF A SILK DRESS
MY PRETTY LITTLE MAID SAID THE OGRESS AND HER OLD COMPANIONS COME AND LODGE WITH US
MURPHY AND RODOLPH
RODOLPH SHE BORE IT WELL AND SILENTLY
OUR MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURES ARE WHOLLY UNKNOWN
MURPHY SAID WHEN I FIRST CAME TO HIS AID SAID THE DOCTOR
A THIRD WAS PROVIDED WITH A SMOOTHING-IRON FOR HER USE
YOU FORGET YOUR SHOP AND THAT YOU ARE HERE AT HOME COME M
I HAD MY KNIFE IN MY HAND--I BELONGED TO THE COOKERY--AND I WENT IT MY HARDEST I CUT SLASHED,--SLASHED CHOPPED AS IF I WAS IN THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE
NEVER MIND WHETHER I KNOW THEM OR NOT YOU SHALL KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
STILL BE IT REMEMBERED THAT SPITE OF THE CLOSE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE CHARLATAN SURGEON-DENTIST AND THE POLIDORI OF BYGONE YEARS THERE STILL EXISTED DISCREPANCIES SO GREAT THAT RODOLPH BALANCED IN DEEP UNCERTAINTY RESPECTING THEIR PROVING TO BE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON
IT'S A FACT THAT I HAVE OFTEN GONE WITH AN EMPTY BREAD-BASKET FASTED FOR TWO DAYS AT A TIME
THE OLD PRINCESS ADORED HER YOUNG PROTEGEE AND WOULD HAVE ANSWERED TO GOD HIMSELF FOR SARAH'S VIRTUE
RODOLPH HE SAID THE HORSES ARE READY ADIEU FATHER
YOU WON'T THEN TAKE A DRAIN OF NOTHIN TO-NIGHT SAID THE OGRESS
MURPHY PALE AS ASHES AND WITH DIFFICULTY SUPPORTING HIMSELF WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DOCTOR HERE
SHE HAS COME FROM M
THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BEDRIDDEN AND COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM HER ROOM WHICH WAS ALREADY IN FLAMES
HE COLLARED ME AND I GAVE HIM A PUNCH OF THE HEAD
NOW HE WILL TELL YOU HIS OPINION OF ALL THESE SPITEFUL STORIES ABOUT POOR M
SECONDLY A PAIR OF OLD PLATED CANDLESTICKS TARNISHED BY TIME AND BEARING INSTEAD OF LIGHTS TWO GILDED ORANGES,--DOUBTLESS AN OFFERING TO THE PORTERESS ON THE LAST NEW YEAR'S DAY
CASTLES IN THE AIR
IT MIGHT BE THAT THE FINE PERSON THIS M
BRAS ROUGE IN HIS OWN NAME MIND YOU
DURING THE CONTEST BETWEEN THE CHOURINEUR AND THE UNKNOWN A CHARCOAL-SELLER OF HUGE SIZE ENSCONCED IN ANOTHER PASSAGE HAD CONTEMPLATED WITH MUCH ANXIETY THE PROGRESS OF THE COMBAT BUT WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO OFFER THE SLIGHTEST ASSISTANCE TO EITHER ANTAGONIST
BUT DO NOT SPEAK AGAINST MY LARDING-PIN IT MAKES NO NOISE AND DOES NOT DISTURB ANYBODY AND DOES ITS WORK AS SHOULD BE
HE WILL FULFIL THE DESIRE OF THOSE WHO FEAR HIM
FINDING HIS SISTER IN FULL PANOPLY FOR HIS CAMPAIGN SEYTON LEFT WITH HER FOR GERMANY FURNISHED WITH THE BEST LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION
IF THEY DO M
RODOLPH AND I DIDN'T DARE RETURN THERE SOONER
THE WHITE RABBIT IS SITUATED IN THE CENTRE OF THE RUE AUX FEVES
BUT REMORSE EVENTUALLY OVERWHELMED THE INSTINCT
FOR ALAS AND ALACKADAY
I NOW DISCOVER THE USEFULNESS OF THE COLONEL
ONE OF THE MEN WITH THE VILLAINOUS ASPECT WHOM WE HAVE BEFORE DESCRIBED AS BEING VERY PALE HIDING HIS LEFT HAND AND CONTINUALLY PULLING HIS CAP OVER HIS BROWS LEANED TOWARDS THE OGRESS WHO WAS CAREFULLY WIPING THE TABLE WHERE RODOLPH HAD TAKEN HIS SEAT AND SAID TO HER IN A HOARSE TONE HASN'T THE GROS-BOITEUX BEEN HERE TO-DAY NO SAID MOTHER PONISSE
OH WHAT A FINE STEEPLE EXCLAIMED LA GOUALEUSE
YOU SEEM COMPLETELY OUT OF HUMOUR
WHAT EXPIATIONS HAVE YOU NOT MADE RODOLPH RAISED HIS HEAD
ONE DON'T KILL A MAN AND SOON FORGET IT YOU MUST KNOW YOU FEEL SOME REMORSE THEN CHOURINEUR REMORSE
WHY NOT COUNT YOUR ROSARY IN HONOUR OF YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER WHOM YOU NEVER KNEW MY FATHER AND MOTHER ABANDONED ME IN THE STREET LIKE A PUPPY THAT IS ONE TOO MANY IN THE HOUSE
IT'S UNPOLITE TO CONTRADICT YOU BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT
KEEP YOUR WEATHER-EYE OPEN AND BRIGHT LOOKOUT
WHILE A SORT OF SMALL WICKET LATTICED WITH WIRE-WORK ENABLED ALL VISITORS TO BE DULY SCRUTINISED ERE THEY WERE ADMITTED
BUT I CANNOT TAKE THEM
HER HUSBAND TO WHOM MONSEIGNEUR HAS SPOKEN OF SARAH AS SHE DESERVED HAS BEGGED HIS WIFE TO SEE HER AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE
PICK IT UP THERE THERE UNDER HIM AND STRIKE HIM HOME IN THE BACK BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS
AND IF I DIDN'T KNOW HER TO BE AS HONEST A GAL AS IS I SHOULD NEVER LET HER GO OUT OF SIGHT GOUALEUSE OWES YOU NINETY FRANCS NINETY FRANCS TEN SOUS
THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE AN ADVANTAGE IN ENGAGING THE VACANT CHAMBER RECENTLY BELONGING TO GERMAIN IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE
RODOLPH CLOTHED IN A LONG DRESSING-GOWN OF BLACK VELVET WHICH INCREASED THE PALLOR OF HIS FEATURES WAS SEATED BEFORE A LARGE TABLE COVERED WITH A GREEN CLOTH
AND SUCH A POWER OF FINE FURNITURE AS WAS SENT INTO THE FIRST FLOOR
BUT THERE WAS A DECIDED NEATNESS IN HIS COSTUME
I REPENT MOST SINCERELY OF MY INVOLUNTARY FAULT SAID THE UNFORTUNATE BARON WITH AN EXPRESSION OF COMIC DESPAIR ON HIS COUNTENANCE TRULY LUDICROUS
GO GO AND I WILL DROP INTO MY HOLE TO-NIGHT THEN AT TEN O'CLOCK AT THE CORNER OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES AND THE ALLEE DES VEUVES
PIPELET TURNING VERY RED AND PRECEDING HIS NEW LODGER TO THE FLOOR ABOVE
HE FELT THAT THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD REMAINED HONEST IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST CRUEL PRIVATIONS WAS TO BE RESPECTED TWOFOLD SINCE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME BECAME A CERTAIN RESOURCE FOR HIM
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF CHOURINEUR ASKED RODOLPH WITH INTEREST
YOU ARE BESIDE ME,--DON'T STIR
I WILL TELL EVERYTHING TO MY EMPLOYER
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO OWN TO SO MUCH CHILDISHNESS BUT I CONFESS MYSELF AMUSED WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MY TREATING MADAME PIPELET IN THE MORNING TO A GLASS OF CORDIAL AND THEN PROCEEDING IN THE EVENING TO A GRAND FETE WITH ALL THE POMP AND PRESTIGE OF ONE OF THOSE PRIVILEGED BEINGS WHO BY THE GRACE OF GOD REIGN OVER THIS LOWER WORLD SOME MEN OF SMALL FORTUNE WOULD SPEAK OF MY REVENUES AS THOSE OF A MILLIONAIRE ADDED RODOLPH IN A SORT OF PARENTHESIS ALLUDING TO THE LIMITED EXTENT OF HIS ESTATES
DO YOU PREFER THE THICK OR THIN TRIPE
THE ARREST 59 VI
WHAT AN OLD ASS NOT TRUE SIR HIS MAN REPLIED
AND I OUGHT TO PUT A LITTLE BELL ROUND ITS NECK AND USE IT TO FEED OUT OF MY HANDS OF COURSE SHE WOULD COME WHEN YOU CALLED HER
AT THAT MOMENT WHEN THIS MAN RETIRED AND BEFORE THE DOOR COULD BE SHUT RODOLPH SAW THE CHARCOAL-DEALER WHOSE BLACK FACE AND TALL FORM WE HAVE ALREADY ALLUDED TO AND HE HAD JUST TIME TO MANIFEST TO HIM BY AN IMPATIENT GESTURE HOW MUCH HE DISLIKED HIS WATCHFUL ATTENDANCE
HE MURDERED THE CATTLE-DEALER AND AS THEY SAY ANOTHER PERSON BESIDES IN THE RUE DU ROULE
THE ROPE MAY BE USEFUL FOR AT THAT PARTICULAR SPOT THERE IS NO TRELLIS AGAINST THE WALL IN CASE RETREAT SHOULD BE CUT OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DOOR
THIS RECOLLECTION EXCITED THE MORE HIGHLY HIS SOLICITUDE FOR THE UNHAPPY CREATURE WHOSE NARRATION HE HAD JUST HEARD
THE PECULIAR STYLE OF THE COUNTESS SARAH MACGREGOR'S BEAUTY SERVED TO SET OFF THE FAIR FEMININE LOVELINESS OF HER COMPANION
FOR ELSE I SHOULD HAVE A HARD JOB TO PROVE IT COME NOW LET US VISIT YOUR HOUSE
DO NOT DO US ANY INJURY THE CHOUETTE HAVING CAREFULLY SEARCHED THE POCKETS OF THE TWO VICTIMS OF THIS AMBUSH SAID TO SARAH LET'S SEE YOUR HANDS IF YOU'VE GOT ANY RINGS
THE CHOURINEUR THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE VIEWED THEM WITH INCREASING CURIOSITY
GOUALEUSE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME AND REALLY TURNED QUITE CRIMSON WHEN SHE KNEW YOU WERE HERE
AND I SHALL PROMISE MYSELF THE HAPPINESS OF RECALLING THIS EVENING'S FETE WITH ITS TASTEFUL ARRANGEMENTS AND CROWD OF ATTENDING BEAUTIES
WORD VARIATIONS APPEARING IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT WHICH HAVE BEEN RETAINED
INTENDING TO GIVE MYSELF A TREAT I SENT TO HER EARLY THIS MORNING TO SAY I WAS COMING TO SEE HER
OH HE IS VERY CLEVER INDEED
THE DOCTOR'S CHARACTER AUTHORISING THE CONFIDENCE BESIDES THE MORALITY WHICH INVESTED IT SEYTON OPENED TO HIM ON THE NECESSITY OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN RODOLPH AND SARAH
WHO COULD FORESEE NOW YOU SEE IF I HAD LISTENED TO YOU INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE OF REAL SERVICE TO YOU I SHOULD CLEAN YOU OUT OF ALL YOUR CASH TRUE TRUE
THE LAMP OF THE TAVERN ONLY SHED A DIM AND FLICKERING LIGHT
YOUR CHAMBER HAS TWO WINDOWS LOOKING OUT UPON THE FLOWER GARDEN AND A SMALL MEADOW WATERED BY THE RIVER WE MENTIONED
BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE COMPLAINED IF THEY HAD MADE ME AS BEGGARS OUGHT TO BE MADE
AT LEAST AS TO WHAT TAKES PLACE IN THE LITTLE ROOM I WAS TELLING YOU OF WHERE LA CHOUETTE ALONE IS ADMITTED WITH M
HER HYPOCRISY CLOTHED IN MOST ATTRACTIVE SHAPES EASILY DELUDED THE SIMPLE-HEARTED GERMANS AND THE GENERAL FEELING SOON AUTHORISED THE EXTREME KINDNESS OF THE GRAND DUKE
THANKS HE MURMURED
A VERY GOOD SERMON AND VERY WELL SPOKEN
YES MY GOOD FELLOW REPLIED HE AS HE EMPTIED HIS GLASS AT A GULP
CALL THE WATCH
I ATE THIS MORNING AS USUAL MY HA'PORTH OF MILK AND MY HA'PORTH OF BREAD THE ENTRANCE OF ANOTHER PERSONAGE INTO THE CABARET INTERRUPTED ALL CONVERSATION FOR A MOMENT AND EVERYBODY TURNED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NEWCOMER WHO WAS A MIDDLE-AGED MAN ACTIVE AND POWERFUL WEARING A LOOSE COAT AND CAP
COUNTESS SARAH AND MYSELF ARE SWORN ENEMIES REPLIED HE TO ME ONCE IN A JOKING MANNER
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
WHEN I BEGAN TO SLASH CHOURINER THESE POOR OLD BEASTS IT HAD QUITE AN IMPRESSION ON ME
BLIND REPEATED THE BEWILDERED AND DISCOMFITED RUFFIAN
I AM NOT AT ALL FEARFUL OF GOING MONEY AND ALL TO YOUR PLACE
WHY THEN FEAR TO PRAY TO HIM OR TO ENTER HIS HOLY CHURCH OH NO NO M
FOR HE CURED ALFRED OF A RHEUMATIC ATTACK AND I PROMISE YOU WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN IT
THE BLEEDING HEART
WHY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ASKED RODOLPH
WELL HE WAS RIGHT NOT TO SHOW HER FOR I NEVER SEE SUCH AN UGLY CREETUR IN MY BORN DAYS
YES I SPOILED THE SKINS BECAUSE I SLASHED AND CUT THEM ACROSS AND ACROSS
IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU NOT TO SET ON THIS FRIEND OF YOURS AGAINST ME WHEN I WAS DOWN AND AT HIS MERCY
DO NOT YOU THINK IT IS WONDERFUL M
ARE YOU TAKING LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES
THOMAS SEYTON AND THE COUNTESS SARAH
BUT WHAT AILS YOU COMRADE--I MEAN MASTER RODOLPH
PRAY DO NOT BE ANGRY BUT WHY HAVE YOU SENT AWAY THE CARRIAGE
YOUR DARKNESS SHALL COMMENCE EVEN IN THIS LIFE
BECAUSE I HOPE YOUR HUSBAND WILL JOIN US WHEN HE RETURNS SO SAYING HE PLACED A FRANC IN THE FAT DIRTY HAND OF THE PORTERESS
IS SHE NOT GRACEFUL
I HATE YOU
FROZEN IN THE WINTER SCORCHED IN THE SUMMER FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HOURS A DAY IN THE WATER
ONE IS NEVER TIRED IN THE OPEN FIELDS OF LOOKING AT ALL THESE AMUSING SIGHTS IT IS INDEED A PLEASURE TO BEHOLD THE DELIGHT YOU SEEM TO TAKE IN ALL THESE TRIFLING MATTERS FLEUR-DE-MARIE
SUPPOSE I GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE M
BUT I NEVER TASTED THEM
MURPHY IS
17 SO WHEN WE GO HE WILL TELL US IF ANY ONE HAS COME OR NOT THAT'S GOOD THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD SCARCELY UTTERED THESE WORDS THAN HE MADE A SUDDEN RUSH AT RODOLPH GRAPPLED HIM BY THE THROAT AND FLUNG HIM VIOLENTLY DOWN THE CELLAR WHICH WAS YAWNING BEHIND THE TABLE
GOD GRANT SHE MAY NOT REAPPEAR AMONGST US LADEN WITH FRESH MISFORTUNES BUT STILL UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES ANY VIEWS COUNTESS SARAH MAY ENTERTAIN MUST BE ABSURD IN THE GREATEST DEGREE
TO BEAT A CHILD IS NO SUCH GREAT THING BUT TO ILL-USE ONE SO--HEAVEN AND EARTH RODOLPH HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE RECITAL OF FLEUR-DE-MARIE AND NOW LOOKED AT THE CHOURINEUR WITH ASTONISHMENT
AND WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL THE LAST OCCUPANT OF THE CHAMBER I AM ABOUT ENGAGING INQUIRED RODOLPH
BRAS ROUGE ENTRUSTED THE CHOUETTE LONG THE ESTABLISHED PARTNER IN ALL THE SCHOOLMASTER'S SCHEMES OF VILLAINY
BUT MY DEAR MURPHY I HOPE THE DESPATCH OF THE SPECIAL COURIER IS NOT A BAD SIGN
THE STORM WOULD BLOW OVER AND THE FUTURE SOVEREIGN OF GEROLSTEIN WOULD BECOME THE MORE BOUND TO POLIDORI IN PROPORTION AS THE DOCTOR HAD UNDERGONE GREATER DANGERS IN HIS SERVICE
HOW FAR IS IT FROM PIERREFITTE TO ST OUEN ABOUT A LEAGUE AND FROM ST OUEN TO PARIS AS MUCH WELL IF I HAD NOT FOUND ANY ONE AT PIERREFITTE,--THAT IS IF THERE HAD BEEN AN EMPTY HOUSE THERE,--WHY THERE ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD JOB
YOU CAN HARDLY GUESS WHAT SHE SOMETIMES IS ASKED TO LEND UPON
17 IS IT NOT AND THE PORTER'S NAME IS PIPELET
IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO REPULSE THEM THEIR SHARP COLD BITE INFLICTED ON HIM A MOST ACUTE AGONY WHILE HIS FACE AND HANDS STREAMED WITH BLOOD FROM THE MULTITUDE OF WOUNDS RECEIVED
YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE TICKER FINETTE
IT REQUIRES THE PITILESS EYE OF A CREOLE TO DETECT THE MIXED BLOOD IN THE ALL BUT IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADE WHICH LIGHTLY TINGES HER ROSY FINGER-NAILS
CHINESE LANTERNS OF TRANSPARENT SILK SOME PALE BLUE OTHERS PINK PARTLY CONCEALED AMID THE FOLIAGE THREW A SOFT AND GENTLE LIGHT OVER THIS ENCHANTING SCENE
THESE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS NOT HAVING A HOLIDAY
RODOLPH HAD TAKEN HER AWAY FROM THERE
TRUE I DID SUGGEST THIS ROBBERY TO YOU,--I'LL TELL YOU WHY
BUT THE DREAM--THE DREAM--BY HEAVEN AND EARTH
WEIGHED DOWN AND ABASHED AT HIS PRESENCE SHE ALMOST REGRETTED HAVING MADE SO CANDID A NARRATIVE TO HIM OF HER UNHAPPY LIFE
WHICH WAY AM I TO GO MASTER ASKED THE DRIVER
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE STABBED THE CATTLE-DEALER AT POISSY AND ROBBED HIM IF HE HAD ONLY BEEN AS STRONG AS ME EH NO SAYS HE
THUS THEN MADAME REPLIED RODOLPH WILL YOUR FLATTERING RECEPTION OF TO-NIGHT LIVE LONG IN MY MEMORY
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING ANY OF THE PASSERS-BY TURN ROUND I HAD NO SUCH INTENTION YOU ARE WRONG YOUNG MAN
PAY A VISIT TO MUSETTE THE POULTRY YOUR PETS THE PIGEONS THE FLOWERS IN THE GARDEN TILL NINE O'CLOCK WHEN YOUR WRITING-MASTER ARRIVES MY WRITING-MASTER WHY YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU LEARNED SUCH NECESSARY THINGS AS READING WRITING AND ACCOUNTS YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOUR AUNT TO KEEP HER BOOKS RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCE OF THE FARM OH TO BE SURE
BUT I THINK I CAN GUESS
COME THERE TO-MORROW QUITE ALONE WITH YOUR MONEY IN YOUR HAND
AN OLD BROWN WIG OR RATHER AS YELLOW AS HIS BILIOUS COMPLEXION PERCHED ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD SHOWED THE NAPE OF THE OLD FELLOW'S WITHERED NECK
SHE HAS ALSO SHED BLOOD AND HER UNBLUSHING INFAMY IS ASTOUNDING 9 THE CREOLE ISSUE OF A WHITE AND QUADROON SLAVE
THE TWO PERSONS WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE TAPIS-FRANC WERE QUITE OF ANOTHER CLASS FROM THOSE WHO ORDINARILY FREQUENTED IT
BUT NOT A WORD OF THAT NOW
GERMAIN WAS A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN SO HONOURABLE AND KIND-HEARTED OPEN AS THE DAY AND EVER READY TO SERVE AND OBLIGE
PRAY DON'T GIVE YOURSELF THAT TROUBLE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER STOPPING HIM
BUT I LAY WITH MY BREAST ON HIS ARM AND SO HE ONLY HAD HIS FIST AT LIBERTY
WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL HER HEAD DROOPING ON HER BOSOM HER FULL BLUE EYES GAZING MECHANICALLY ABOUT HER THE UNFORTUNATE BEING SEEMED BOWED DOWN WITH THE WEIGHT OF HER OPPRESSIVE THOUGHTS
AT ST OUEN YOU WERE WELL PLACED FOR EITHER OPERATION,--THAT WAS CLEAR
SHE COULD NOT WORK AND HER TIME WAS VERY NEAR AT HAND AND SHE HAD NOT A SON TO PAY FOR THE BED IN A GARRET FROM WHICH THEY DROVE HER
I SAY M
THE ONLY PERSON WHO REALLY KNOWS THE PRESENT RESIDENCE OF THE YOUNG MAN IS A FEMALE LODGING IN THE HOUSE NO
HE KNOWS MANY A SECRET WHICH HE BOASTS WITH CONSIDERABLE EFFRONTERY OF HAVING TURNED TO A GOOD ACCOUNT
NOW TRAILING AT THEIR ROOTS THEN AMBITIOUSLY SCALING THE VERY WALLS TILL THEY HUNG THEIR UNITED TRESSES ROUND THE TRANSPARENT AND VAULTED ROOF FROM WHICH AGAIN THEY FLOATED IN MINGLED MASSES WAVING IN THE PURE LIGHT BREEZE LOADED WITH SO MANY ODOURS
THE INFANT NOW GROWN INTO A YOUNG WOMAN THEN BORE THE APPELLATION OF LA GOUALEUSE
COMING AWAY FROM THIS BRAS ROUGE'S ABODE AFTER A STRUGGLE IN WHICH I WAS ENGAGED I MET WITH THIS UNFORTUNATE GIRL ALAS
HE WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE ON THE WATCH WHILST YOU GO INSIDE THE HOUSE YOU ARE RIGHT,--LITTLE TORTILLARD IS AS CUNNING AS A FOX
SARAH AND HER BROTHER UNDERSTOOD HIM IN A MOMENT ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NOT TOLD THE DOCTOR A SYLLABLE OF THEIR SECRET DESIGNS
RODOLPH I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY I DO NOT PITY YOU AT ALL
AND SO THE NAME OF MLLE
HE IS TURNED OUT-OF-DOORS PERHAPS PUT INTO THE CAGE,--AND THAT IS ALL
AH MASTER RODOLPH HERE'S A CURIOUS MEETING WHICH I AM SURE NEITHER YOU NOR I EXPECTED THEN HE ADDED IN A SERIOUS TONE LISTEN MASTER
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN THE STRONGEST MINDS ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUPERSTITIOUS IDEAS AND AT THIS JUNCTURE RODOLPH VIEWED THE FATAL AMOUNT OF STAIRS AS AN ILL AUGURY
HE IS MY BENEFACTOR THEN YOU WILL LOVE HER
THERE IS SOME NEW FOLLY IN HAND AND I AM SURE OF IT MY GOOD FRIEND YOU MEAN WELL
GOING ON THE VERY TOP OF HIS TOES DRAWING UP HIS LEGS EXTENDING HIS ARMS AND SWELLING OUT HIS BACK AND SHOULDERS IN A MANNER SO LUDICROUS AS UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY DIVERTING
MON DIEU WHO WAS THERE TO GIVE ME ANY PLAYTHINGS SAID THE GIRL IN A SAD TONE
AND HE WAS PUFFING LIKE A BULL I HEARD HIS TEETH GRIND
AS I PUSHED AGAINST IT IT CREAKED
THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE WERE TALKING OVER THEIR OWN DARK PLANS IN LOW TONES AND FLASH LANGUAGE
KEEP IT MY GOOD WOMAN FOR YOURSELF AND PERHAPS YOU WILL TAKE A GLASS WITH US YOU'RE UNCOMMON PURLITE SIR LOOKING AT THE COUNTESS'S BROTHER WITH AS MUCH SURPRISE AS GRATITUDE
WHAT AILS ME
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY IDEA MASTER RODOLPH I LIKE IT VERY WELL MY LAD
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT SUCH A MENTAL AND CONSTANTLY PRESENTED PICTURE WILL SEND THE BLUSH OF SHAME EVEN UPON YOUR HARDENED FEATURES THAT YOUR SOUL DEADENED AS IT NOW IS TO EVERY GOOD AND HOLY IMPULSE WILL BECOME SOFTENED AND TENDER BY REPENTANCE
THERE YOU SEE THERE IS NO ONE HERE DEUCE TAKE IT
THE RENDEZVOUS
IT WILL BE I WHO SHALL HAVE CAUSED HIS DEATH,--MY GOOD MY FAITHFUL MURPHY THIS CRUEL THOUGHT NERVED THE ARM OF RODOLPH WITH FRESH VIGOUR AND AGAIN HE BENT HIS MOST POWERFUL ENERGY TO ENDEAVOUR TO FORCE THE PONDEROUS DOOR
I DO NOT HESITATE FOR SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT THERE IS A ROD IN PICKLE FOR THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE
IS IT USUAL TO PROCLAIM IN THE OPEN STREETS THAT THE SUN SHINES WHEN ALL MAY SEE AND FEEL CERTAIN OF HIS MIDDAY BRIGHTNESS NOW BARON YOU ARE SHIFTING YOUR GROUND AND BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS AS YOU BECOME MORE ADROIT
ABOUT THE END OF AN HOUR RODOLPH BEGAN THOUGH SLOWLY TO RESUME HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
ASSURED OF THE NATURAL KIND HEART OF THE YOUNG PRINCE AND WARNED BY A SECRET PRESENTIMENT MURPHY THOUGHT HIM FOR A TIME PERVERTED BY THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE OF DOCTOR POLIDORI WHOM HE INSTINCTIVELY ABHORRED AND RESOLVED TO WATCH VERY NARROWLY
FOR YOU ARE PLAYING THE TAMBOURINE ON THAT PANE OF GLASS WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT
YOU SHOULD SEE THE STRONG BOLTS SHE HAS INSIDE HER DOOR
THE ENTRANCE HAS A GLASS DOOR TWO VENETIAN BLINDS OUTSIDE MEMORANDUM SAID THE RUFFIAN
I WAS ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE
HOWEVER SINCE THE COMMANDANT HAS ALLOWED ME HIS PALTRY TWELVE FRANCS A MONTH FOR LOOKING AFTER HIS APARTMENTS I HAVE MANAGED ONCE A WEEK TO MAKE A LITTLE BROTH FOR THESE POOR UNFORTUNATE CREATURES
THEY CALMLY CALCULATED THE PROBABLE RESULTS OF THE CRUEL DIVISIONS THEY SHOULD ESTABLISH BETWEEN A FATHER AND SON UP TO THAT PERIOD SO TENDERLY UNITED
IF YOUR BRAINS ARE NOT BLOWN OUT HERE THE SCAFFOLD AWAITS YOU I PREFER THE SCAFFOLD,--I SHALL LIVE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE MONTHS LONGER
A FEW SHORT MOMENTS AND HE WOULD BE BEREFT EVEN OF THE POWER OF CALLING UPON GOD OR MAN TO HELP HIM
I STILL HELD ON AND STRUGGLED WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER BUT HE KEPT GIVING ME SUCH DREADFUL BLOWS ON MY JAW THAT I WAS ABOUT TO LET GO MY HOLD WHEN I SAW THREE OR FOUR ARMED MEN WHO CAME DOWN THE STAIRS AND M
THE READER HAS NOT FORGOTTEN THE TWO GUESTS AT THE TAPIS-FRANC WHO WERE WATCHED SO CLOSELY BY THE THIRD INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD COME INTO THE CABARET
I WILL HOLD HIM HERE AS FAST AS IF IN A VICE
HIS COUNTENANCE RESEMBLED BOTH THE WEASEL AND THE RAT
FOR IN FACT DAVID NO LONGER BELONGED TO HIM WE CALCULATED AS NEARLY AS WE COULD THE EXPENSE WHICH HIS STUDIES HAD COST FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEN THE PRICE THRICE OVER OF HIMSELF AND CECILY AS SLAVES
THAT MODE OF SETTLING YOUR LONG AND HEAVY ACCOUNTS WILL NOT HALF PAY THE DEBT
I WILL FOLLOW THE CHOUETTE LIKE HER SHADOW AND THE MAN SHALL NOT SAY A WORD THAT I DO NOT OVERHEAR
IT HAD INDEED RISEN ABOVE HIS ANKLE
THE OGRESS SEATED AT HER BAR AND USED TO SUCH SCENES REMAINED MOTIONLESS WITH HER HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HER APRON
BUT THE NOTES YOU ARE TO GIVE ME MY DEAR BARON HAVE YOU THEM WITH YOU HERE THEY ARE DRAWN UP PRECISELY FROM THE ACCOUNTS FURNISHED BY M
ALL RIGHT YOUNG MAN
THE HOUSE HAS SIX WINDOWS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND HAS NO UPPER STORY,--SIX SMALL WINDOWS WITHOUT ANY FASTENING
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR THE BEST SO I SAID I'LL WALK OUT AND PERHAPS THE CLEAR AIR WILL BRIGHTEN MY THOUGHTS A BIT I WENT OUT AND THE OPEN AIR CLEARED MY BRAIN
THEN YOU WILL BEGIN FROM TO-DAY TO LAY BY THE FORTY SOUS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WILL YOU
WHAT DO YOU SAY MASTER
YOU ARE YOKELS
HERE HE IS SAID THE DOCTOR
I ASSURE YOU I MAY SAFELY BE TRUSTED BUT REALLY SIR REJOINED PIPELET I DO NOT THINK THERE IS THE LEAST DEPENDENCE TO BE PLACED IN SUCH REPORTS
I SAW THE TALL MAN AND LITTLE WOMAN GET INTO A COACH NEAR NOTRE DAME AND I GOT UP BEHIND AND WE WENT ON UNTIL WE REACHED THE BOULEVARD DE L'OBSERVATOIRE
RODOLPH EXCLAIMED FLEUR-DE-MARIE
WHY SINCE THE OCCUPIER DOES NOT RETURN UNTIL THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW YES BUT I--I CANNOT THIS EVENING REALLY
HE HAS BEEN MURDERED
THIEVES HAVE A PARCEL OF CHILDREN WHOM THEY SEND TO PRY ABOUT AND HIDE THEMSELVES TO OPEN THE DOORS OF HOUSES
THEN I HAD TO SEEK MY BREAD ELSEWHERE AND I DIDN'T FIND IT VERY READILY
SO THE ROOSTING-PLACE OF THE TALL MAN AND THE LITTLE WOMAN MUST BE THERE THANKS MY WORTHY FRIEND YOU HAVE DONE ME A MOST ESSENTIAL PIECE OF SERVICE WITHOUT KNOWING IT I BEG YOUR PARDON MASTER RODOLPH BUT I BELIEVED I WAS SERVING YOU AND THAT WAS THE REASON I DID AS I DID I KNOW IT MY FINE FELLOW AND I WISH I COULD RECOMPENSE YOUR SERVICE MORE PROPERLY THAN BY THANKS
RODOLPH CONTINUED
RODOLPH CONTINUED
BROKEN BY HIS CHILDREN CRYING FOR FOOD BY THE GROANS OF HIS SICK WIFE TOSSING ON HER MISERABLE STRAW BED OR THE IDIOTIC SCREAMS OF THE POOR BEDRIDDEN OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO SOMETIMES HOWLS LIKE A WOLF,--FROM HUNGER TOO,--FOR POOR CREATURE
WHAT PULLING AWAY AT THE OLD STUFF YES
HE IS THE SOBEREST STEADIEST CREATURE ALIVE
THE CHOURINEUR AND THE SCHOOLMASTER REMAINED ALONE
I HAVE BEEN TOLD WONDERFUL THINGS OF A WINTER GARDEN,'--A WORK FROM FAIRYLAND
PASSAGES IN ITALICS ARE SURROUNDED BY UNDERSCORES
HE TRUSTED TO BECOME NOT ONLY THEIR DOCTOR BUT THEIR FIRM FRIEND AND DEFENDER WITH THE COLONIST HE MUST INDEED BE IMBUED WITH THE MOST UNFLINCHING PROBITY AND THE MOST INTENSE LOVE FOR HIS FELLOW CREATURES TO RETURN TO A MASTER,--AN OWNER,--AFTER HAVING SPENT EIGHT YEARS IN THE MIDST OF THE SOCIETY OF THE MOST DEMOCRATIC YOUNG MEN IN EUROPE JUDGE OF THE MAN BY THIS ONE TRAIT
BUT AT A FURTHER GLANCE THEY SEEMED TO HIM WORTHY A MORE ATTENTIVE OBSERVATION
NEITHER BROTHER NOR SISTER PAUSED FOR A MOMENT IN THEIR BAD DESIGNS
PREPARE THE MEANS FOR YOUR PUNISHMENT ARE AT HAND RODOLPH'S COUNTENANCE WAS IMPLACABLE
IT IS QUITE AT YOUR SERVICE SAID THE OGRESS MAKING A VERY INSINUATING NOD WITH HER HEAD
RODOLPH SAID THAT I HAD HEART AND HONOUR I FELT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME AND AT THAT MOMENT I SAW THE CHOUETTE STANDING CLOSE BY US WITH HER GLARING EYE AND RED SHAWL
AND YOUR RELATIONS
YOU REMEMBER THAT EH TO BE SURE I DO
GERMAIN REPLIED RODOLPH WITH SOME DIFFICULTY PRESERVING THE GRAVITY OF COUNTENANCE DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE ACCORDED HIM THE FAVOUR NOT TO THE BEST LODGER THAT TREADS SHOE-LEATHER WOULD I GRANT A SIMILAR REQUEST REPLIED THE MAN IN THE FLAPPED HAT WAVING IT MAJESTICALLY OVER HIS BROWS AS HE SPOKE
ONLY SEE HER AT WORK
YOU SLY ROGUE I'M UP TO YOU SARAH COLOURED SLIGHTLY AS HER BROTHER CONTINUED I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT ABOUT BRAS ROUGE
I SPOILED MY WORK
I HAVE ENOUGH TO OCCUPY MY THOUGHTS WITHOUT TRYING TO RECALL PAST MISFORTUNES
THE CHOURINEUR HAS TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THIS
AND HAS MOREOVER COURAGEOUSLY BORNE HERSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST SEVERE TRIALS
THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT HAD WHOLLY DISAPPEARED
THE YOUNG LADY KNEW FULL WELL HOW TO PROPITIATE ALL AROUND HER AND PARTICULARLY THE PERSONS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN JEALOUS OR ENVIOUS OF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SHE CAUSED HER BEAUTY AND GRACE TO BE FORGOTTEN BENEATH THE VEIL OF MODEST SIMPLICITY WITH WHICH SHE COVERED THEM
WE WERE MOST HOSPITABLY RECEIVED BY MR WILLIS WHO THE EVENING AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AFTER HE HAD BEEN DRINKING AND AS MUCH FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF WINE AS FROM A DESIRE TO BOAST TOLD US IN A HORRID TONE OF BRUTAL JESTING THE HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY
THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BROUGHT IN THIS MAN HAD WITHDRAWN AND RODOLPH THE DOCTOR THE CHOURINEUR AND THE ASSASSIN WERE LEFT ALONE
RODOLPH WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE
SHE BLUSHED WHEN SHE SAW RODOLPH AND LOOKED DOWN WITH A CONFUSED AIR
RODOLPH HE WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED VILLAIN AND HAS ONLY GOT WHAT HE RICHLY DESERVES
TO ENLIGHTEN RODOLPH ON THE INTERESTED VIEWS OF SARAH WAS TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE RECEPTION WHICH A LOVER IS SURE TO GIVE WHEN SHE WHOM HE LOVES IS DEPRECIATED IN HIS EYES
YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE AND YOU STABBED HIM WITH YOUR PONIARD SO M
HER EMOTION OVERCAME HER
THEREFORE SUCH CONSEQUENCES MUST BE AVOIDED
A MARRIAGE SURROUNDED BY NUMBERLESS DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION
AS FOR SEYTON HE KNEW HOW TO MAKE HIMSELF VERY USEFUL IN THE OCCUPATION WHICH HAD BEEN CONFERRED UPON HIM
PRAY BE ON YOUR GUARD EXCLAIMED THE GOUALEUSE RETREATING AGAIN INTO THE DARK PASSAGE AND TAKING HER CHAMPION BY THE ARM
I ROSE SO EARLY THAT I FEEL SLEEPY AND WILL HAVE A NAP TOO HE SHUT HIS EYES AND VERY SOON THE HARD BREATHING OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE WHO SNORED IN CHORUS SO COMPLETELY DECEIVED RODOLPH THAT THINKING HIS COMPANIONS SOUND ASLEEP HE HALF OPENED HIS EYES
NOR DID THE CHOUETTE HEAR ANYTHING OF HER FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHEN SHE UNEXPECTEDLY MET WITH HER AT A SMALL PUBLIC-HOUSE IN THE CITE NEARLY SEVEN WEEKS AGO
THE SOUNDS OF THE ORCHESTRA WEAKENED BY DISTANCE AND BROKEN BY THE JOYOUS HUM PROCEEDING FROM THE GALLERY DIED LANGUIDLY AWAY AMONG THE MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE OF THE HUGE TREES
NOW YOUR HEART SCOFFS AT THE VERY MENTION OF REPENTANCE BUT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN BOWED TO THE EARTH WITH DEEP CONTRITION YOU WILL BEWAIL YOUR VICTIMS IN DUST AND ASHES
AS HE RETURNED TO THE PORTERESS HE INQUIRED WHETHER A FEMALE HAD NOT JUST COME DOWN-STAIRS
AND TALKING OF CONSOLING OURSELVES THERE STANDS THE CASSIA AND WE HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF TASTING IT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH MADAME PIPELET AFTER WHAT I HAVE JUST HEARD I HAVE NO INCLINATION TO PARTAKE OF IT
GAG HIM CRIED THE NEGRO ENTERING THE CLOSET
FOR THOUGH MLLE
THE HOUSE WHICH RODOLPH HAD IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES WAS NOT HIS USUAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE
THE GOUALEUSE WAS PERHAPS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND A HALF YEARS OLD
LEARNING THAT THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE GOING INTO GERMANY THE OLD MARQUIS GAVE THEM LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THE FATHER OF OUR NOBLE LORD WITH WHOM HE KEPT UP A CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE
YOU MUST KNOW SIR SAID MADAME PIPELET IN A LOW TONE TO RODOLPH THAT PAINTERS HAVE EMBITTERED ALFRED'S LIFE
AND THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN MY BREAD-BASKET WAS SO OFTEN EMPTY
RODOLPH WAS NO LONGER OUT OF TEMPER BUT CALM SAD AND COLLECTED
RODOLPH BECAUSE YOU BEAT ME BECAUSE THINKING YOU A WORKMAN LIKE MYSELF BECAUSE YOU SPOKE SLANG AS IF YOU HAD LEARNED IT FROM THE CRADLE I TOLD YOU MY HISTORY OVER TWO BOTTLES OF WINE AND AFTERWARDS I SAVED YOU FROM BEING DROWNED,--YOU GIVE ME A HOUSE--MONEY--I SHALL BE MASTER
BUT THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS UTTERING A PECULIAR NOTE SEIZED THEM
HOW IT DID BURN
YOU AND I ARE OF THE SAME FAMILY WHAT
YOU SEE THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO TEMPT YOU TO DO MISCHIEF YOU ARE NOT MY JUDGE AND I WILL NOT ANSWER YOU ANOTHER QUESTION ILLUSTRATION
AND SO THE IDLERS OF ISLE-ADAM WHO WERE ON THE MORNING BEFORE US WALKING IN THE SQUARE BEFORE THE CHURCH WERE VERY ANXIOUSLY BESTIRRING THEMSELVES TO LEARN WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ARRIVE WHO HAD RECENTLY BECOME THE PURCHASER OF THE MOST ELIGIBLE PREMISES FOR A BUTCHER IN THAT TOWN AND WHICH WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CHURCH
IT IS A BAD EXAMPLE TO SET BEFORE A GAZING CROWD THE SPECTACLE OF A CONDEMNED BEING MAKING SPORT OF THE INSTRUMENT OF DEATH SWAGGERING BEFORE THE EXECUTIONER AND YIELDING WITH AN OBSCENE JEST THE DIVINE SPARK INFUSED INTO MAN BY THE BREATH OF A CREATING GOD
ALTHOUGH PREPARED TO FIND IT A DIFFICULT TASK INASMUCH AS IT WAS MORE THAN PROBABLE IF THE GRISETTE WERE REALLY SUFFICIENTLY IN GERMAIN'S CONFIDENCE TO BE AWARE OF HIS PRESENT ABODE SHE ALSO KNEW TOO WELL HIS ANXIETY TO CONCEAL IT TO BE LIKELY TO GIVE THE DESIRED INFORMATION
YOUR SECOND-FLOOR LODGER LENDS OUT AGAIN THE MONEY SHE DERIVES FROM HER SKILL IN FORETELLING EVENTS BY READING THE CARDS EXACTLY SO
AND WE WILL NOT PART COMPANY BEFORE EVENING THEN I'M YOUR MAN
HE REALLY IS A GOOD-LOOKING MAN AND DRESSES WELL THOUGH HE STINKS OF MUSK LIKE A CIVET CAT
TORTILLARD HAS COME WITH THE CHOUETTE
THE CHOUETTE PROCEEDED
HE IS NOT TEN YEARS OF AGE AND YET IT WAS HE WHO THE OTHER DAY A SIGNAL FROM THE SCHOOLMASTER INTERRUPTED THE CHOUETTE
THREE YEARS
THIS INFERNAL CABRION HAS MURDERED MY WHOLE LIFE AND PIPELET HEAVED SO PROFOUND A SIGH THAT HIS HAT VIBRATING FOR SOME TIME FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONVULSIVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD OCCASIONED THEREBY FELL FORWARD AND COMPLETELY VEILED HIS CARE-STRICKEN FEATURES
IF THE CULL SINGS OUT FOR THE TRAPS I HAVE MY VITRIOL IN MY POCKET AND WILL BREAK THE PHIAL IN HIS PATTER-BOX NOTHING LIKE A DRINK TO KEEP CHILDREN FROM CRYING SHE ADDED
THE ROOM IN WHICH THE SCENE TOOK PLACE THAT WE ARE DESCRIBING WAS LONG AND NARROW LIGHTED BY ONE WINDOW WHICH LOOKED INTO THE STREET AND WAS OPPOSITE TO THE DOOR
I ONLY ASK YOU TO HAVE ME TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR THIS NIGHT'S ROBBERY AND THE CATTLE-MERCHANT AT POISSY THAT AFFAIR CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT,--THERE ARE NO PROOFS
THE ABSURD PREDICTIONS OF AN OLD HIGHLAND NURSE HAD EXCITED ALMOST TO MADNESS THE TWO LEADING VICES IN SARAH'S CHARACTER,--PRIDE AND AMBITION
BUT PLEASE TO EXCUSE ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SIR WHILST I FETCH MY BIT OF LEATHER
THE INSTINCT AND THIRST FOR BLOOD REAPPEARED IN ALL THE FULLNESS OF THEIR FEARFUL PREDOMINANCE
AND MLLE
A MAN WITH MINES OF WEALTH EXCLAIMED THE CHOURINEUR
BRAS ROUGE AND AN OLD ONE-EYED WOMAN CALLED LA CHOUETTE RODOLPH OPENED HIS EYES WITH UNMIXED ASTONISHMENT AS THESE NAMES SOUNDED ON HIS EAR AND THE PORTERESS INTERPRETING THE SURPRISE OF HER FUTURE LODGER ACCORDING TO HER OWN NOTIONS SAID
YOU WILL BECOME MILD AND GENTLE WHEN YOU ARE DEPRIVED OF THAT STRENGTH
FOR AT THE FIRST MOMENT SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE RESULT OF THE STRUGGLE
TELL ME DARLING SHA'N'T WE LAY HANDS ON PEGRIOTTE THE FIRST TIME WE MEET WITH HER
WHEN I WAS COLD--VERY COLD I DO NOT DOUBT IT FOR THE FEATHER OF BEANS STRAW IS A VERY COLD SORT OF STUFF SAID THE CHOURINEUR
YOU SHALL NOT SEE HER BUT I MAY REQUIRE HER SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE DAVID FELT RELIEVED OF AN ENORMOUS WEIGHT OFF HIS MIND
THE ALBINOS CALLED THE CHOURINEUR A FREED CONVICT WORKER AT THE WOOD THAT FLOATS AT ST PAUL'S QUAY
AND IS IT A PROFITABLE JOB SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN GOLD IN THE PROPRIETOR'S CABINET AND YOU KNOW ALL THE WAYS PERFECTLY SILENCE HERE WE ARE
YOU ARE A VAST DEAL BETTER TO ME THAN I FEAR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO YOU UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES I BELIEVE YOU TOO
YET WHILE SUFFERING THE JUST PUNISHMENT OF HIS CRIMES HIS BASE MIND DEVISED THE DOUBLE ATROCITY OF TEARING THE CHILD FROM ITS MISERABLE MOTHER FOR THE SAKE OF BREAKING DOWN EVERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IT MIGHT HAVE IMBIBED AND OF TRAINING IT UP IN VICIOUS READINESS TO JOIN HIS FUTURE SCHEMES OF VILLAINY
WE WILL GIVE YOU GOOD CLOTHES AND THEN YOU MAY AMUSE YOURSELF I DIDN'T LIKE THEM AND REFUSED SAYING TO MYSELF I KNOW HOW TO SEW VERY WELL AND I HAVE TWO HUNDRED FRANCS IN HAND
AN EVENT IMPATIENTLY DESIRED BY SARAH SOON TURNED THIS CALM INTO A TEMPEST,--SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
I BATHED ITS POOR FADING LEAVES IN THE CLEAR WATERS OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THEN TO DRY IT I PLACED IT FOR A FULL QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN THE SUN
AND SO TRACTABLE SHE WOULD THROW HERSELF INTO THE FIRE FOR ME APROPOS OF FIRE IT IS NOT OVERWARM HERE REPLIED RODOLPH PLACING BOTH HIS HANDS UNDER HIS BLOUSE
HER WOOLLEN GOWN FELL UPON BLACK WOODEN SHOES SCORCHED ALMOST BLACK BY THE SMALL STOVE AT WHICH SHE WARMED HER FEET
HIS UNEASY MANNER AND DEEP ABSTRACTION DID NOT ESCAPE THE PORTERESS
AFTER REMAINING FOR SOME MINUTES QUITE MOTIONLESS THE CHOURINEUR SHOOK HIS LEGS AND ARMS AND THEN PARTLY ROSE FROM THE GROUND
LOOK AT ME
YES SIR
BRADAMANTI SAID THE PORTER
HIS LAST HOPE EXTINGUISHED RODOLPH SEATED HIMSELF IN GLOOMY DESPAIR AND LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR BEWAILED THE PERILOUS SITUATION OF HIS FAITHFUL FRIEND,--PERHAPS AT THAT VERY MOMENT STRUGGLING BENEATH THE ASSASSIN'S KNIFE
RODOLPH CAME FROM HIS HOUSE NO DOUBT I TOLD YOU THAT BRAS ROUGE PASTIQUE LA MALTOUZE THOMAS REGARDED THE CHOURINEUR WITH AN AIR OF SURPRISE
I CUT OFF
DE GRAUEN FINISHING HIS REPORT AND PRESENTING IT TO HIS COMPANION YOU SEE EVIDENTLY THAT IT IS FROM THE NOTARY JACQUES FERRAND WE MUST HOPE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION RESPECTING THE PARENTAGE OF LA GOUALEUSE AND THAT WE MUST GO TO MLLE
YES SEPARATED FOR EVER FROM THIS EXTERNAL WORLD YOUR THOUGHTS MUST NEEDS REVERT TO YOURSELF AND YOUR VISION DWELL INTERNALLY UPON THE BYGONE SCENES OF YOUR ILL-SPENT LIFE
BLESS YOU SHE CAN READ IN YOUR HAND THE SAME AS A BOOK AND MANY QUITE FIRST-RATE PEOPLE COME TO HER TO HAVE THE CARDS CONSULTED WHEN THEY ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR MATTER
WHY ALL MY TROUBLES AND MISFORTUNES HAVE HAPPENED BECAUSE I DID NOT SAVE MY MONEY MORE CAREFULLY
WELL COUGHING AND WHEEZING I REACHED THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM,--I HAD MY WAX IN THE PALM OF MY HAND
IF THEY HAVE ABANDONED YOU THEN WHEN THEY SEE THE FRIGHTFUL DESTINY TO WHICH THEY HAVE BROUGHT YOU THEIR SHAME AND REMORSE WILL AVENGE YOU WHAT IS THE GOOD OF VENGEANCE YOU ARE RIGHT
I KNOW NOTHING OF HIM SAYS I
BUT ABOUT THE YOUNG PERSON YOU WERE DESCRIBING IN THE BLUE FIACRE OH
CHAP
I HEAR THE CRY OF A CHILD THEY CALLED BACK THE DOG
IF YOU BEAT THE CHOUETTE THEN THE SCHOOLMASTER SAY NO MORE MY LASS
THEN A DEEP VOICE EXCLAIMED MY DOG BARKS,--SOMEBODY IS HID IN THE YARD THEY ARE THIEVES SAID ANOTHER VOICE
LE DOCTEUR AND SIT DOWN BUT M
THE SEINE SWOLLEN BY PERPETUAL FALLS OF RAIN HAD RISEN VERY HIGH AND OVERFLOWED A PART OF THE QUAY
BUT THESE WORDS DO YOU SEE THEY QUITE MAKE MY HEART BEAT
SAY RATHER HIS INTREPID BODY-GUARD MY WORTHY FRIEND
DO YOU THINK I WILL EXPOSE FINETTE TO THE CHANCE OF CATCHING COLD AND EXPOSING HER PRECIOUS LIFE AND SPOILING HER NEW SHAWL YOU ARE RIGHT OLD FELLOW
A COWARD SAYS I TO HIM
RODOLPH IT OUGHT NOT TO BE
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
YOU TOLD US MY GOOD FELLOW THAT YOU MET OUR COMRADE RODOLPH IN THE HOUSE WHERE BRAS ROUGE LIVES INQUIRED THOMAS SEYTON AS HE HOB AND NOBBED WITH THE CHOURINEUR
HERE IS MY CHILD WHO HAS COME TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS M
ALL BLOOMING IN FULL HEALTH AND VIGOUR AND DISPLAYING THEIR FOLIAGE IN ALL ITS LUXURIANCE GAVE TO THE TOUT ENSEMBLE A MASS OF RICH BRILLIANT TROPICAL VERDURE WHICH GLITTERING AMONG THE THOUSAND LIGHTS SPARKLED WITH THE COLOURS OF THE EMERALD
BECAUSE I MUST RETURN TO HER THIS EVENING
WHAT FRESH GRIEF HAVE YOU FOUND NOTHING,--NOTHING INDEED M
THE CRACKED WALLS FORMERLY COVERED WITH PLASTER WERE NOW ORNAMENTED IN PLACES WITH COARSE DRAWINGS OR SENTENCES OF FLASH AND OBSCENITY
THE CARPET-MAKER CALLED HIM COMMANDANT A MILITARY MAN I SUPPOSE SAID RODOLPH
TO THOSE UNHAPPY WRETCHES WHO CONTRARY TO OTHER MEN COUNT WITH BITTER JOY THE HOURS WHICH BRING THEM NEARER TO THE TOMB,--TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WHO LOOKED FORWARD ONLY TO NOTHINGNESS HEREAFTER DAVID BREATHED THE LANGUAGE AND THE HOPE OF A FREE AND HAPPY IMMORTALITY
BRADAMANTI IS TAKING OUT
I KNEW YOU WERE A RUNAWAY CONVICT,--YOU KNOW THE PARENTS OF THE UNFORTUNATE GIRL ALL WHOSE MISFORTUNES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY YOUR MISERABLE ACCOMPLICE THE CHOUETTE
NOT EVEN EATING AND DRINKING
I COMMEND YOUR CHILD TO YOUR CARE,--OUR CHILD I SHOULD SAY
NEVER MIND THAT
I FEAR OUR RENCONTRE WITH THE CHOURINEUR HAS MADE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE AND WE WERE SO MERRY TOO OH NO M
SO YOUNG AND CHARMING A WOMAN MUST SUFFER BY THE CONTACT WITH SUCH AN INFERNAL TALKING OF INFERNAL CREATURES SAID MURPHY HERE IS A COMMUNICATION RELATIVE TO CECILY THE UNWORTHY SPOUSE OF THE EXCELLENT DAVID BETWEEN OURSELVES MY DEAR MURPHY THIS AUDACIOUS METISSE_[9 WELL DESERVES THE TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT THAT HER HUSBAND OUR DEAR BLACK DOCTOR HAS INFLICTED ON THE SCHOOLMASTER BY MONSEIGNEUR'S ORDER
NO NO,--NOT AT ALL
THIS SCOUNDREL PERHAPS HAS KILLED HIM AND THEN I WENT WITH REDOUBLED STRENGTH AT THE SCHOOLMASTER WHO TRIED TO STICK ME WITH HIS LARDING-PIN
IN THE MIDST OF THE PURE AIR OF THE MEADOWS WOODS AND MOUNTAINS HE UNDERWENT AN ENTIRE CHANGE AND GREW UP AS VIGOROUS AS A YOUNG OAK
THE REMAINDER OF THE GARDEN WAS THUS DEVISED

IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT POINT TO HAVE ASCERTAINED THE DIRECTION IN WHICH TO SEARCH UNDOUBTEDLY BARON
PRETTY AND NOT DEAR ANSWERED THE OLD CREATURE LAUGHING
RODOLPH HAS BEHAVED QUITE RIGHT I AM OF YOUR OPINION
DARK AND NOISOME ALLEYS LED TO STAIRCASES STILL MORE BLACK AND FOUL AND SO PERPENDICULAR THAT THEY COULD HARDLY BE ASCENDED BY THE HELP OF A CORD FIXED TO THE DANK AND HUMID WALLS BY HOLDFASTS OF IRON
WERE THEY NOT WHY I REALLY DID NOT PERCEIVE IT M
THEY GOING TOWARDS THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND I TO NOTRE DAME
MY POT IS BOILING OVER,--EXCUSE ME A MINUTE I MUST JUST LOOK TO IT
LET ME ASSURE YOU M
WHO SAVED ME FROM DROWNING IN THAT HORRID CELLAR
TRUE
TRUE
BRAS ROUGE IS A DEEP ONE WHAT COULD RODOLPH WANT AT THE HOUSE OF THIS MAN ASKED SARAH
RODOLPH YOU APPEAR TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE CHOUETTE SAID TO YOU YESTERDAY THAT SHE KNEW THE PERSONS WHO HAD BROUGHT YOU UP OH
YOU SING LIKE A NIGHTINGALE BEHAVE YOURSELF VERY PRETTILY ARE CALLED FLEUR-DE-MARIE AND YET YOU COMPLAIN
THE SCHOOLMASTER DARTED AT HIM A GLANCE OF DEADLIEST HATE
THANKS TO THE CARE OF MURPHY AND RODOLPH WHO WITH DIFFICULTY CALMED HIS AGITATION THE CHOURINEUR WAS COMPLETELY RESTORED TO HIMSELF AND WAS ALONE WITH THE PRINCE IN ONE OF THE ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR IN THE HOUSE
SARAH AND HER BROTHER OFTEN TALKED OF THEIR DEPARTURE BUT THE SOVEREIGN OF GEROLSTEIN WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO IT
BUT NOW THAT AT LEAST THREE-QUARTERS OF HIS TIME ARE TAKEN UP WITH THE FAMILY HE CAN HARDLY MANAGE TO EARN FORTY SOUS THAT IS LITTLE INDEED,--POOR CREATURES YES IT IS EASY TO SAY POOR CREATURES BUT THERE ARE SO MANY EQUALLY POOR CREATURES THAT AS WE CAN DO NOTHING FOR THEM IT IS NO USE TO WORRY OURSELVES ABOUT IT,--IS IT ALFRED
HE PAYS FOR ALL
MONSEIGNEUR RECOMMENDED HIM MOST WARMLY AS HIS RELATION
FOOLISH GIRL THAT I WAS I HAD LISTENED TO YOU TILL I QUITE FANCIED THIS PARADISE WERE A TRUE PICTURE AND SO IT IS MY DEAR CHILD
RODOLPH WENT ON
FOR A CHILD OF SEVEN YEARS OF AGE WHO IS HALF DEAD WITH HUNGER AND COLD IT IS A LONG WAY FROM THE RUE DE LA MORTELLERIE TO MONTFAUCON BUT EXERCISE HAS MADE YOU GROW AS STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW MY GIRL
IN THIS PEACEFUL RETREAT SHE HAS FOUND TRANQUILLITY IF NOT HAPPINESS
FOR THIS HOUSE ALL THAT IT CONTAINS THE SHOP AND A THOUSAND CROWNS WHICH ARE IN THIS POCKETBOOK,--ALL ARE YOURS THE CHOURINEUR SMILED WITH A STUPID AIR FLATTENED HIS LONG-NAPPED HAT BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SQUEEZED IT CONVULSIVELY EVIDENTLY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT RODOLPH SAID TO HIM ALTHOUGH HIS LANGUAGE WAS PLAIN ENOUGH
FROM THE BAGNE
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO A CARPET-MAKER CAME HERE TO LOOK AT THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH WAS THEN TO LET AND TO ASK THE PRICE AND OTHER PARTICULARS ABOUT IT
DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST SIMPLICITY RODOLPH WORE A WHITE WAISTCOAT AND CRAVAT
TO THE DECREES OF AN ALL-WISE AND INSCRUTABLE PROVIDENCE HE RESIGNED HIMSELF AND HUMBLY ACCEPTED HIS PRESENT PUNISHMENT AS THE JUST REWARD FOR A CRIMINAL ACTION AS YET UNEXPIATED
MADAME M
RIGOLETTE HEARD US COMING UP-STAIRS AND THAT SHE IS WATCHING TO HAVE A LOOK AS WE GO DOWN
IT IS AN ODD SIGN FOR A CABARET ASKED RODOLPH
BUT I WILL SEE HIM,--I WILL JUDGE FOR MYSELF
AND BESIDES HE HOPED TO IMPROVE MORALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SLAVES HIS FORMER COMPANIONS
NO ONE KNOWS WHITHER HE HAS GONE NOR ARE THEY LIKELY EXCEPT INDEED THROUGH MLLE
YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THE MISERY I SHOULD EXPERIENCE WERE YOU TO TELL ME ALL THIS HAPPINESS WAS BUT A JEST MY CHILD LISTEN TO ME SAID RODOLPH WITH A TONE AND MANNER WHICH ALTHOUGH STILL AFFECTIONATE WAS MINGLED WITH A DIGNIFIED ACCENT AND MANNER FLEUR-DE-MARIE HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY REMARKED IN HIM
PERHAPS A TONE MORE GENTLE SWEET AND SILVERY NEVER FELL ON HUMAN EAR
ONLY I HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE TO FIND YOU OUT
BUT THEN LET ME DO THE MAN JUSTICE
YOUR HEALTH MATE SAID HE AND THE HEALTH OF YOUR LITTLE FRIEND WHO--BUT MUM
SUCH CONVERSATIONS MUST MAKE DEEP AND DANGEROUS IMPRESSIONS ON A YOUNG ARDENT AND VIRGIN MIND AND SUCH THEORIES COULD NOT BE WITHOUT THEIR RESULTS
AND WHEN YOU HAVE NOT A TOOTH LEFT I WILL THROW YOU INTO THE RIVER AND THE FISH SHALL EAT YOU THE OLD DEVIL
AND YET WITH ALL THAT I WAS AS PLUMP AS A SKYLARK WHAT
LITTLE TORTILLARD FETCHED A COACH FOR HER AND SHE HAS JUST DRIVEN AWAY IN IT
HEARING ME COUGH THE PORTER SAID,'I'LL FETCH YOU A MORSEL OF SUGAR TO PUT IN YOUR WATER HE PROBABLY LOOKED FOR A SPOON FOR I HEARD PLATE CHINK,--PLATE IN THE ROOM ON THE LEFT-HAND
CHAPTER XXIV
FIRE AND SMOKE
HOW PRECIOUS GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU AGAIN M
CHAPTER XXII
I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TELL WELL THEN HARK YE
AT TEN O'CLOCK SHE DISMISSES YOU WITH A KISS AND A BLESSING TO YOUR CHAMBER
THE CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK TEN A.M
AT THE TERMINATION OF A FEW MINUTES THE POSTMAN TAPPED AT THE LODGE WINDOW AND PUTTING HIS HAND INTO THE APARTMENT PRESENTED TWO LETTERS MERELY SAYING THREE SOUS SIX SOUS YOU MEAN FOR TWO LETTERS REPLIED RODOLPH
AND BESIDES MY LIFE WHEN I FIRST WENT TO THE BAGNE WAS RATHER QUEER
TOO WISE VIRTUOUS AND RIGHT-MINDED TO LISTEN TO THE HOST OF FLATTERERS BY WHOM SHE WAS SURROUNDED MADAME D'HARVILLE SMILED AS GRATEFULLY ON ALL AS THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM CREDIT FOR SPEAKING THE TRUTH HAD NOT HER OWN MODEST OPINION OF HER JUST CLAIMS TO SUCH HOMAGE HAVE FORBIDDEN HER ACCEPTING OF PRAISE SHE NEVER COULD HAVE DESERVED
IT WAS IN THIS WAY I FIRST KNEW THE SCHOOLMASTER
HE PAYS TEN SOUS FOR HIS BED WELL THEN CONTINUED RODOLPH FOUR SOUS FOR TOBACCO
WHEN I COULD GO THERE SHE ADDED FOR YOU KNOW MADAME I KNOW MY CHILD FOR I SHALL ALWAYS CALL YOU MY CHILD I COULD NOT LET HER GO ON WHEN I SAW HER COVER HER FACE FOR SHAME I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY
IN TIME OF YOUR PROSPERITY YOU WERE NOT IDLE AND NOW YOU HAVE BECOME MY MANAGER HERE WHERE--THANKS TO YOUR EXCELLENT SUPERINTENDENCE INTELLIGENCE AND ACTIVITY--THIS ESTABLISHMENT PRODUCES ME PRODUCES YOU MY LORD SAID MADAME GEORGES INTERRUPTING RODOLPH
YOU CAME INTO THIS GARDEN FORCIBLY
AND THEN THAT HILL WITH ITS PRETTY WHITE HOUSES HALF HID AMONG THE TREES AND THE LEAVES STILL SO GREEN THOUGH WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH OF OCTOBER
BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING ABOUT HIM THEN TURNING TO THE GOUALEUSE ON MY WORD YOU ARE A GOOD WENCH AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEATEN YOU
YOU PATTER FLASH LIKE A FAMILY MAN
AND AS SUCH I WILL THANK YOU TO KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY WAIST AND NOT TO CALL ME YOUR ANGEL AND SCOLD ME FOR BEING LATE
BUT THOUGH CLAD IN A HAT AND COAT ESTEEMED BY PIPELET AND HIS WIFE AS CLOSELY RESEMBLING FULL DRESS ALFRED HAD NOT LAID ASIDE THE MODEST EMBLEM OF HIS TRADE BUT FROM HIS WAIST UPROSE THE BUFF-COLOURED TRIANGULAR FRONT OF HIS LEATHERN APRON PARTLY CONCEALING A WAISTCOAT BOASTING NEARLY AS GREAT A VARIETY OF COLOURS AS DID THE PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE OF MADAME PIPELET
MADAME GEORGES LEANING ON MARIE'S ARM ENTERED WITH HER INTO A SMALL ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHERE THE ABBE LAPORTE WAS WAITING
YES THAT I AM RESPONDED THE CHOURINEUR AS THOUGH GRATEFUL FOR THE SOUND OF A VOICE TO BREAK THE FRIGHTFUL BEWILDERMENT OF HIS IDEAS
BUT LET ME BEG OF YOU NOT TO DESTROY THE MERRY CREATURES PAINTED ON THE PALETTE AT THE ENTRANCE
WELL MOTHER BURETTE SAID TO HER I WILL LEND YOU TEN FRANCS ON YOUR BIRD BUT IF BY THIS DAY WEEK AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I DO NOT RECEIVE TWENTY FRANCS WITH INTEREST IT WOULD AMOUNT TO THAT IN ROUND NUMBERS IF I AM NOT PAID MY TWENTY FRANCS WITH THE EXPENSES OF HIS KEEP I SHALL GIVE YOUR POLLY A TRIFLING DOSE OF ARSENIC MIXED WITH HIS FOOD SHE KNEW HER CUSTOMER WELL BLESS YOU
SHE PROTESTED WITH HYPOCRITICAL TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE CONSTRAINT IN WHICH SHE LIVED
THOSE RAGS
OH WHEN I MEET HER AGAIN AT THE TAPIS-FRANC WON'T I PAY HER OFF THERE THAT'LL DO FINETTE
AS FOR THE FRIENDSHIP NOW SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE PRESENT MARQUIS AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS I BELIEVE IT COMMENCED WHEN AS MERE BOYS THEY MET TOGETHER ON A VISIT PAID BY THE THEN REIGNING GRAND DUKE TO THE LATE MARQUIS D'HARVILLE SO I HAVE HEARD
BUT UPON THE WHOLE I THINK THE RESULT OF OUR INQUIRIES VERY SATISFACTORY UPON MY WORD YOUR M
AND THEN TO LOVE THE OBJECT SHOULD BE GOOD AND VIRTUOUS WHY DO YOU THINK SO OH BECAUSE ONE'S LOVER OR HUSBAND WOULD BE ALL IN ALL TO US AND WE SHOULD SEEK NO GREATER HAPPINESS THAN DEVOTING OUR LIFE TO HIM
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS SEATED BY THE STOVE ORIGINAL ETCHING BY ADRIAN MARCEL YES THERE IS A ROOM TO LET ON THE FOURTH FLOOR BUT YOU CANNOT SEE IT NOW,--ALFRED HAS GONE OUT YOU ARE SPEAKING OF YOUR SON I PRESUME MADAME
WELL THIS WENT ON FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS WHEN I SUPPOSE HE KNEW IT WAS NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER
HE WORE A WHITE NECK-HANDKERCHIEF A DEEP WAISTCOAT AND A LONG BLACK COAT WITH VERY WIDE SKIRTS
RIGOLETTE AND WHO IS MLLE
A DOOR OPENED AND THEY WERE BOTH IN THE PRESENCE OF RODOLPH
THE DOOR OF THE TAVERN OPENED AND ALL OF THE POLICEMEN DASHED INTO THE ROOM WHILST OUTSIDE WERE SEEN THE MUSKETS OF THE GENS-D'ARMES
I MEAN TO KEEP MY PROMISE IN EVERY RESPECT I ASSURE YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE PRESSED HER HANDS TOGETHER WITH EARNEST GRATITUDE
BY THE TIME YOU REACH HOME UPON MY WORD IT IS SEVEN O'CLOCK
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU,--THEY DO LOOK UNCOMMONLY PRETTY AND SET OFF A PLACE SO WELL
UNHAPPY CHILD
A FEW DAYS AFTER SEYTON'S DEPARTURE SARAH WAS AT THE EVENING COURT OF THE DOWAGER GRAND DUCHESS
WE WILL HEREAFTER INFORM OUR READERS OF THE MOTIVES AND EVENTS WHICH HAD BROUGHT THE COUNTESS AND HER BROTHER INTO THIS CABARET OF THE CITE
I WILL SOON COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN THE VENERABLE PASTOR LEANING ON THE ARMS OF MADAME GEORGES AND LA GOUALEUSE WHO SUPPORTED HIS TOTTERING STEPS LEFT THE ROOM TO SEE RODOLPH DEPART
THE CHOURINEUR CLAD IN RAGS AND SOILED WITH MUD STOOD MOTIONLESS WITH FOLDED ARMS AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
HERE'S YOUR MONEY
I CHOSE THEM BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR MORE NATURAL
IN REFERENCE TO THE TONE OF HER VOICE
THE NIGHT WAS DARK AND STRONG GUSTS OF WIND MINGLED WITH RAIN DASHED AGAINST THE WALLS
MURPHY THE PERSON WHO IS ABOUT TO EMPLOY YOU IS UP-STAIRS THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO EMPLOY ME YES WHY THEN DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT BEFORE I'LL TELL YOU ONE MOMENT SAID THE CHOURINEUR WITH A DOWNCAST AND EMBARRASSED AIR TAKING MURPHY BY THE ARM
ALTHOUGH THIS WORTHY PAIR HAVE AS MUCH REASON FOR UTTER DESPAIR AS THEY HAD EIGHTEEN YEARS SINCE OF ENTIRE SUCCESS EIGHTEEN YEARS
YOU SEE THAT I DO ADVICE TO AMATEURS AND BRINGING HIS SHAGGY BROWS TOGETHER BY A FROWN WHICH MADE HIS WIDE AND FLAT FOREHEAD CLOSELY RESEMBLE A TIGER'S HE MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE
ON THIS TABLE WAS THE SCHOOLMASTER'S POCKETBOOK THE PINCHBECK CHAIN OF THE CHOUETTE TO WHICH WAS SUSPENDED THE LITTLE SAINT ESPRIT OF LAPIS LAZULI THE BLOOD-STAINED STILETTO WITH WHICH MURPHY HAD BEEN STABBED THE CROWBAR WITH WHICH THE DOOR HAD BEEN FORCED AND THE FIVE NOTES OF A THOUSAND FRANCS EACH WHICH THE CHOURINEUR HAD FETCHED OUT OF THE NEXT APARTMENT
DID I NOT TELL YOU TO DO SO YES COMMANDANT
AND AGAINST THE FETE-DIEU OH I MADE SUCH LOVELY BOUQUETS FOR THE ALTAR BUT GOD IS MERCIFUL AND GOOD
IT MAY BE SERVICEABLE
THE BLACK COMFORTED HER AND INSTANTLY WENT TO MR WILLIS TO REQUEST HER HAND IN MARRIAGE DIABLE MY DEAR MURPHY I CAN EASILY SURMISE THE ANSWER OF THE AMERICAN SULTAN,--HE REFUSED HE DID
BUT LET US BEGONE
DAVID POINTED TO A SIDE DOOR WHICH OPENED INTO AN ADJOINING CLOSET
THAT'S THE MOST SENSIBLE THING YOU HAVE SAID YET YOUNG FELLOW
WHAT YOU ARE UP AGAIN I SEE
MISERY DESTITUTION IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD HAD WEIGHED DOWN THIS WRETCHED GIRL CAST AT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE ON THE WIDE WORLD OF PARIS
WHY I SEEM TO HAVE MADE TOO GREAT A START ALL OF A SUDDEN AND THAT IT CANNOT LAST
FROM THIS ACCOUNT AND THE DECLARATIONS OF THE CHOUETTE IT APPEARED THAT ONE MADAME SERAPHIN HOUSEKEEPER TO A NOTARY NAMED JACQUES FERRAND HAD IN 1827 INSTRUCTED TOURNEMINE TO FIND A PERSON WHO FOR THE SUM OF ONE THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE THE ENTIRE CHARGE OF A CHILD OF FROM FIVE TO SIX YEARS OF AGE WHOM IT WAS DESIRED TO GET RID OF AS HAS BEFORE BEEN MENTIONED
RODOLPH DO WE NOT INQUIRED LA GOUALEUSE AS EARNESTLY AS THOUGH EVERY SYLLABLE HER EARS DRANK IN WAS TO BE EFFECTUALLY BROUGHT TO PASS
ONCE IN MY POWER I LEAVE YOU THE CHOICE OF BEING HANDED OVER TO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE WHICH WILL MAKE YOU PAY WITH YOUR HEAD THE ASSASSINATION OF THE CATTLE-DEALER IT IS FALSE
BLIND REPEATED THE MISERABLE WRETCH AS LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE CHOURINEUR HE SLOWLY TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE HOUSE IN THE ALLEE DES VEUVES
WITHOUT ENUMERATING THE CRIMES WHICH HAVE ACCUMULATED TO SEND THIS WRETCH TO THE BAGNE FOR HIS LIFE HE HAS COMMITTED THREE MURDERS,--THE CATTLE-DEALER MURPHY AND YOURSELF
ON THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE STREAM RISES A SMALL HILL PLANTED WITH FINE OLD CHESTNUT-TREES
SHE WAS RATHER LAME I OBSERVED AND WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE WANTS WITH THE FORTUNE-TELLING WOMAN THAT I DO NOT KNOW
ACROSS THE FIELDS ONE MAY SEE A LONG WAY
KEEP A BRIGHT LOOKOUT AND GIVE ME THE SIGNAL IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING PUT YOUR PINKING-IRON IN THE BUTTONHOLE OF YOUR WAISTCOAT THAT YOU MAY HAVE IT HANDY SAID THE OLD HAG
THE MAN WITH WHITE HAIR AND BLACK EYEBROWS SAT DOWN AT A TABLE WHILST SARAH WAS WIPING HER FOREHEAD AND SAID TO THE OGRESS IN EXCELLENT FRENCH MADAME LET US HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK IF YOU PLEASE THE ENTRANCE OF THESE TWO PERSONS INTO THE TAPIS-FRANC HAD EXCITED UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
I SHOULD BE SORRY INDEED TO MAKE YOU SAD,--I WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT PURPOSELY THAT YOU MIGHT SPEND A HAPPY DAY OH I AM HAPPY
RODOLPH WAS STILL IN A WORKMAN'S DRESS
WHEN I HAVE TIME TO LEAVE MY WOOD-PILES I SHALL GO AND SEE HOW HE GETS ON YOUR WOOD-PILES
I WAS NOT SURE THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME TO-DAY MYSELF AND IF NOT THEN MURPHY WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED MARIE A LABOURER OF THE FARM INTERRUPTED THIS CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN THE GARDEN
DO YOU HESITATE SAID RODOLPH
BUT UPON ONE CONDITION THAT YOU HONOUR ME BY TAKING MY ARM
WHILE I WAS STRUGGLING WITH YOU BOTH TO-NIGHT I HAPPENED TO DISLOCATE HER LEG SO SHE'S OBLIGED TO LIE UP FOR THE PRESENT BUT WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHALL I DO WITH THIS BLACK CURTAIN CONTINUALLY BEFORE MY EYES
I THINK SO,--I DO UPON MY LIFE
WHILST THERE WERE ADDED A POWER OF SEDUCTION THE MORE DANGEROUS AS IT WAS UNITED TO A MIND UNBENDING AND CALCULATING A DISPOSITION CUNNING AND SELFISH A DEEP HYPOCRISY A STUBBORN AND DESPOTIC WILL,--ALL COVERED BY THE OUTWARD SHOW OF A GENEROUS WARM AND IMPASSIONED NATURE
I TELL YOU WHAT THEN WE WILL SETTLE THAT OUT OF THE FIRST MONEY YOU HAVE TO PAY ME
YOU HAVE HAD YOUR FUN IN PROVING ME AS YOU TERM IT
WHEN I HEARD THIS PROPOSAL I SAID TO MYSELF I MUST FIND OUT WHERE THESE TWO DONS LIVE WHO WANT TO SET THE SCHOOLMASTER ON THE HAUNCHES OF M
ABANDONED FROM YOUR INFANCY WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF RIGHT OR WRONG LEFT TO YOUR NATURAL INSTINCT SHUT UP FOR FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE BAGNE WITH THE MOST DESPERATE VILLAINS ASSAILED BY WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS COMPELLED BY YOUR OWN DISGRACE AND THE OPINION OF HONEST MEN TO CONTINUE TO HAUNT THE LOW DENS INFESTED BY THE VILEST MALEFACTORS YOU HAVE NOT ONLY REMAINED HONEST BUT REMORSE FOR YOUR CRIME HAS OUTLIVED THE EXPIATION WHICH HUMAN JUSTICE HAD INFLICTED UPON YOU THIS SIMPLE AND NOBLE LANGUAGE WAS A NEW SOURCE OF ASTONISHMENT FOR THE CHOURINEUR
SEYTON WAS NOT IGNORANT OF THE SORT OF GERMAN WEDLOCK WHICH IS CALLED A LEFT-HANDED MARRIAGE TO WHICH AS BEING LEGITIMATE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HE WOULD AS A LAST RESOURCE HAVE RESIGNED HIS SISTER
GO MY WORTHY FELLOW
THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD FIND ME WORK AND I BELIEVED THEM
CHAPTER XVIII
YOU APPEAR QUITE ANOTHER PERSON TELL ME THEN FLEUR-DE-MARIE WHICH DO YOU LIKE BEST,--THE RODOLPH OF YESTERDAY OR THE RODOLPH OF TO-DAY I LIKE YOU BETTER NOW
THAT WAS NOT ALL
HIS TEMPERAMENT IS DELICATE AND PERHAPS BY ACCUSTOMING THIS CHILD TO LIVE LIKE THE SON OF AN ENGLISH FARMER WITH SOME FEW EXCEPTIONS I SHALL STRENGTHEN HIS CONSTITUTION THE GRAND DUKE SENT TO ENGLAND FOR A MAN WORTHY OF THE TRUST AND CAPABLE OF DIRECTING SUCH A COURSE OF BODILY CULTURE AND SIR WALTER MURPHY AN ATHLETIC SPECIMEN OF A YORKSHIRE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WAS ENTRUSTED WITH THIS IMPORTANT CHARGE
41 WHERE HE PASSES FOR A PERSON OF PIOUS AND AUSTERE LIFE
RODOLPH,--VERY VERY WRONG SAID LA GOUALEUSE IN A TONE OF SUCH DEEP AND GRAVE REMONSTRANCE AS MADE HIM SMILE
FOR YOU IT WOULD BE MERELY THE ARENA IN WHICH LIKE MANY OTHERS YOU WOULD MAKE A DISGUSTING DISPLAY OF HARDENED FEROCITY
BUT THEN HE MAKES HIS OWN DRUGS AND HE HAS FOR HIS ASSISTANT THE SON OF OUR PRINCIPAL LESSEE LITTLE TORTILLARD
AH YOU LITTLE THIEF
FOR THE SLANG OF THE TAPIS-FRANC THE SCHOOLMASTER NOW SUBSTITUTED A STYLE ALMOST POLISHED AND WHICH BETOKENED A CULTIVATED MIND IN STRANGE CONTRAST WITH HIS REAL CHARACTER AND CRIMES
THOMAS SEYTON AND THE COUNTESS SARAH 67 VII
WHAT A GLORIOUS DISH
WHY YOU SEE WHEN YOU CAME TO WHERE I WAS AT WORK AT THE TIMBER-YARD YOU SAID MY LAD I AM NOT RICH BUT I CAN PROCURE YOU A SITUATION WHERE YOUR WORK WILL BE EASIER THAN ON THE QUAI AND WHERE YOU WILL GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY FOUR FRANCS A DAY
I AM BUT SIXTEEN AND A HALF,--WHO KNOWS WHEN YOU SAID WHO KNOWS YOU HAD HOPE YES AND WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO FIND SOME CHARITABLE SOUL WHO WOULD GET ME WORK SO THAT I MIGHT BE ENABLED TO LEAVE THE OGRESS
AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THEREFORE HE RESOLVED ON SERVING SARAH BUT WITH A CERTAIN QUALIFICATION WHICH WE WILL PRESENTLY REFER TO
DO YOU TELL ME WELL THEN I KNEW A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN A SORT OF COMPANION TO ME WHEN I WAS IN PRISON
AND THERE WITH HIS FACE BREAST AND ARMS AGAINST THE WALL AS IF HE WOULD BREAK THROUGH IT TO ESCAPE FROM SO HORRIBLE A VISION HE REPEATED IN A HOLLOW AND CONVULSIVE TONE OH THE SERGEANT
I AM SURE I SHALL BE PROUD TO WAIT UPON SUCH A GENTLEMAN
THEY DESPISED ME AS A SHOEMAKER DOES A COBBLER
MADAME GEORGES RODOLPH AND THE ABBE WERE ALL DEEPLY AFFECTED
HE HAD DEVOURED THE WHOLE HARLEQUIN WITHOUT THE LEAST ASSISTANCE
SARAH AND HE HAD HARDLY MOISTENED THEIR LIPS AND THEIR GLASSES WERE STILL FULL
STAY I DO NOT KNOW HIM SAID THE AGENT DE POLICE LOOKING STEADFASTLY AT RODOLPH
DOESN'T IT FOURLINE ADDED THE OLD BELDAM
WHY WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
PRAY DO
ON TO THE RUE AUX FEVES
IN SPITE OF HIS WICKEDNESS I COULD NOT BELIEVE BUT THAT HE WOULD EMPLOY AT LEAST A PORTION OF THIS MONEY IN THE BRINGING-UP OF THIS UNHAPPY CHILD AND YOUR SON HAD NO SIGN NO MARK BY WHICH HE COULD BE RECOGNISED NO OTHER THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU M
YOU SURPASS THE BOUNDS OF REASON THESE WORDS IMPELLED RODOLPH TO THE VERY HEIGHT OF IRRITATION
BY HIS STEP THE SMALLNESS OF HIS STATURE AND THE DELICACY OF HIS FEATURES IT WAS EASY TO DETECT A WOMAN IN MALE HABILIMENTS
SO THANKS TO THE SORT OF INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION WITH WHICH THEY ARE GIFTED THEY FEEL ALL THE NECESSITY OF THE MORAL MASK AND SO PAINT AND COSTUME THEMSELVES WITH ALL THE ALACRITY AND SKILL OF A PRACTISED COMEDIAN
FOUR SOUS FOR BREAKFAST EIGHTEEN
GIVE ME THE BEAST AND GO BACK TO THE SHOP THE JOURNEYMAN OBEYED
GRACIOUS GOD
D'HARVILLE A FRIENDSHIP WHICH IS FOUNDED ON A GRATEFUL RECOLLECTION OF THE IMPORTANT SERVICES RENDERED BY THE MARQUIS'S FATHER TO HIS OWN PARENT
IT MUST BE A WOMAN'S IT IS THE FELLOW TO THIS RESPONDED THE VOICE
THEY DETERMINED UPON A PRINCIPLE TO BRING TROUBLE AND ANNOYANCE INTO THIS PEACEABLE AND HAPPY COURT
AND PULLS OUT TEETH NOT FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY BUT THE HONOUR OF HIS PROFESSION,--YES REALLY SIR FOR DOWNRIGHT HONOUR
CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN STRENGTH HIS ADDRESS AND AGILITY HE HAD ONLY SHOWN A CONTEMPT FOR THE BRUTE BEAST WHICH HE SUBDUED
EVERY GARMENT THEY HAD HAS PASSED INTO HER HANDS AND EVEN THEIR LAST MATTRESS
THE PROSPECT BEFORE ME IS BUT LITTLE BRIGHTER THAN YOUR OWN
THOSE POOR UNFORTUNATE CREATURES IN THE ATTICS WHOM M
FOR A BRIEF PERIOD CARRIED AWAY BY THE WORDS OF RODOLPH THE BRIGHT FUTURE PRESENTED TO HER MENTAL VISION HAD EFFACED THE HORRIBLE PRESENT
YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE BE IT SO
AH AH SAID I TO MYSELF NOW THE FARCE BEGINS WELL THE LITTLE HOUND OF A CHILD HID HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE DITCHES OF THE ALLEE AND WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE LOOKOUT
AND WHEN YOU PLACED MADAME GEORGES AT THE HEAD OF THE ESTABLISHMENT YOU ACTED WITH THE UTMOST WISDOM AND PROVIDENT GOOD SENSE
IF YOU LOOK SHARP YOU WILL SEE HER AS WE PASS THE LANDING AND TRUE TO THE PORTER'S SUSPICIONS THE DOOR SO TASTEFULLY ENLIVENED BY THE FAT CUPIDS A LA WATTEAU WAS SEEN TO OPEN GENTLY AND RODOLPH HAD A BRIEF VIEW OF A LITTLE TURNED-UP NOSE AND A PAIR OF LARGE STARING BLACK EYES PEEPING THROUGH THE NARROW SPACE
HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND SAID I HAVE TAKEN A WRONG TURNING
HE HAS HAD MISFORTUNES ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM QUITE WEARY OF IT
BADINOT IS A DOWNRIGHT TREASURE YOU SEE BRAS ROUGE IS THE HINGE UPON WHICH EVERYTHING TURNS
THE DOCTOR FOR HIS PART WAS VERY MUCH ANNOYED BY MURPHY'S RETURN FOR HE FEARED HIS FRANKNESS GOOD SENSE AND KEEN PENETRATION
BUT I SOON SILENCED THEM WITH A FEW THUMPS OF MY CHAIN
I AM AWAITING MY COMRADE TO GO TO WORK AND NO DOUBT IT IS THE MODEL OF THE MACHINE WHICH I HAVE AT HOME THAT THEY ARE DESIROUS OF GETTING FROM ME AT ANY PRICE FOR THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TO BE MADE BY THIS DISCOVERY THE TALL MAN AND THE LITTLE WOMAN THEN ARE WORK-PEOPLE WITH WHOM I HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED AND TO WHOM I HAVE REFUSED MY SECRET THIS EXPLANATION APPEARED SATISFACTORY TO THE CHOURINEUR WHOSE APPREHENSION WAS NOT THE CLEAREST IN THE WORLD AND HE REPLIED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN A DECIDED CHARACTER TO THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF RODOLPH
IS HE THE ONLY PERSON WHO INHABITS THIS ABODE
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE LOOKED EVEN PALER THAN USUAL HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH LATELY MY DEAREST CLEMENCE WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO SPEAK TO YOU WITHOUT RESERVE OH YES PRAY DO HOW COMES IT THAT THE LEAST ALLUSION TO YOUR HUSBAND ALWAYS THROWS YOU INTO SUCH A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY ALARM AND UNEASINESS WHAT AN IDEA
THE SCHOOLMASTER SAID IN AN UNDERTONE TO THE CHOUETTE IF WE GO AND HIDE IN THE ALLEY OPPOSITE WE SHALL SEE THE SWELLS COME OUT AND KNOW WHICH ROAD THEY TAKE
RODOLPH SAID THE CHOURINEUR TAKING OFF HIS UPPER COAT WITH HASTE AND TURNING UP HIS SHIRTSLEEVES WHICH DISPLAYED A PAIR OF ARMS LIKE A PRIZE-FIGHTER'S
DON'T FORGET THAT FOURLINE
I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND NOW SAID RODOLPH THAT YOU ARE NOT PARTICULARLY PARTIAL TO PAINTERS
FOR HE WROTE UNDER HIS BLOUSE AND WITHOUT SEEING WHAT HE WROTE
THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE IN SPITE OF THEIR LOUD SNORING HAD THEIR EYES OPEN AND WERE EXCHANGING SOME MYSTERIOUS SIGNS BY MEANS OF THEIR FINGERS CURIOUSLY PLACED OR BENT IN THE PALMS OF THEIR HANDS
I SEEK NO REVENGE FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME PERSONALLY BUT TO-NIGHT YOU HAVE AGAIN SHED BLOOD WITHOUT PROVOCATION
SURELY HUMAN NATURE IS NOT CAPABLE OF SUCH CRIMES SHOCKING
COME ON OLD FELLOW
NO MASTER THERE IS NO ONE THERE PARBLEU I WILL LOOK MYSELF REPLIED THE SCHOOLMASTER JUMPING OUT INTO THE STREET
WHERE IS MURPHY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSIONS ON HIS ACCOUNT ANSWERED THE NEGRO RESPECTFULLY
I WILL ANSWER FOR HIM AND BACK HIM AT THESE WORDS ALL PRESENT FROM THE OGRESS TO THE LOWEST RUFFIAN OF THE TAPIS-FRANC CONTEMPLATED THE VICTOR OF THE CHOURINEUR WITH RESPECT AND FEAR
WHENEVER YOU ARE SPEAKING OF HIM YOUR COUNTENANCE ASSUMES EVEN IN SPITE OF YOURSELF,--BUT HOW SHALL I MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD AND SARAH WITH THE TONE AND FIXED GAZE OF ONE WHO WISHED TO READ THE MOST SECRET THOUGHTS OF THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED SLOWLY AND EMPHATICALLY ADDED A LOOK OF MINGLED AVERSION AND FEAR THE FIXED PALLID FEATURES OF MADAME D'HARVILLE AT FIRST DEFIED EVEN SARAH'S PRACTISED EYE BUT HER KEEN GAZE SOON DETECTED A SLIGHT CONVULSIVE WORKING OF THE MOUTH WITH A TREMULOUS MOVEMENT OF THE UNDER LIP OF HER VICTIM
THICK EYEBROWS AND ENORMOUS WHISKERS OF DEEP RED
THE YOUNG PRINCE PROMISED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND CONCEAL HIS LOVE
AT THE SCAFFOLD I REPEAT YOU WOULD CLING TO HOPE WHILE ONE BREATH REMAINED WITHIN YOU
IT WILL BE NO DOUBT FRESH IN THE MEMORY OF OUR READERS THAT ON THIS SAME EVENING RODOLPH WAS ENGAGED TO BE PRESENT AT A GRAND BALL GIVEN BY THE AMBASSADOR OF BEFORE FOLLOWING OUR HERO IN THIS NEW EXCURSION LET US CAST A RETROSPECTIVE GLANCE ON TOM AND SARAH,--PERSONAGES OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HISTORY
WHY THERE ARE FIVE YOUNG CHILDREN AN ALMOST DYING MOTHER AN IDIOTIC GRANDMOTHER AND THEIR ONLY SUPPORT A MAN WHO THOUGH HE SLAVES LIKE A NEGRO CANNOT EVEN GET BREAD ENOUGH TO EAT,--AND A CAPITAL WORKMAN HE IS TOO
THEN HALF WITH HER PINCERS HALF WITH HER FINGERS SHE PULLED OUT MY TOOTH AND THEN SAID NOW I WILL PULL OUT ONE EVERY DAY PEGRIOTTE
IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SEYTON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE THEN THE BRIGAND PUSHING SEYTON BACKWARDS SHOVED HIM OFF HIS BALANCE AND WITH ONE HAND HELD HIM SUSPENDED OVER THE MOUTH OF THE DEEP EXCAVATION
HE HAD ON A ROUND JACKET AND ONE OF THOSE LONG BLACK APRONS WORN BY THE WAITERS AT THE WINE SHOPS
I OUGHT TO HAVE LISTENED TO HER
I CAME BACK WELL KNOWING WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR ME
FIRST OF ALL IN THE MORNING WAIT A BIT FLEUR-DE-MARIE
I WILL NOT SURRENDER YOU TO THE POWER OF THE LAWS BECAUSE THEY WOULD CONDEMN YOU TO THE GALLEYS OR THE SCAFFOLD
NIGHT CAME ON BUT INTERRUPTED RODOLPH WHY DID YOU NOT GO AT ONCE TO MY HOUSE YOU TOLD ME TO COME THE NEXT DAY MORNING M
THE CHOURINEUR RODOLPH AND LA GOUALEUSE ETCHING BY ADRIAN MARCEL AFTER THE DRAWING BY FRANK T
WHERE IS MY CHILD AT THIS MOMENT
YOU ARE THEN QUITE ALONE SAYS I TO M
AND--WHO KNOWS?--THIS WOMAN MAY BE CHEATING SOME EASYGOING SIMPLETON OF A HUSBAND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR TWO-PENNY-HALFPENNY OF A COMMANDANT
HE WORKS BY THE PIECE
CHAPTER XXVI
THEN SHE STAMPED UPON ME SCREAMING OUT AH THE NASTY LITTLE BRUTE
I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AT THAT MOMENT
IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE SALON ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND WHICH FORMED THE ANTECHAMBER TO RODOLPH'S BUSINESS CHAMBER MURPHY WAS SEATED BEFORE A BUREAU AND SEALING SEVERAL DESPATCHES
BUT LET ME BE JUST AND TELL THE TRUTH
WHAT IS THIS BRAS ROUGE IL PASTIQUE LA MALTOUZE SMUGGLES SAID THE CHOURINEUR IN A CARELESS TONE AND THEN ADDED THIS IS JOLLY GOOD WINE MOTHER PONISSE IF YOU THINK SO DO NOT SPARE IT MY FINE FELLOW SAID SEYTON AND HE FILLED THE CHOURINEUR'S GLASS AS HE SPOKE
WE WOULD SOON HAVE MADE THE PLACE TOO HOT TO HOLD ANY PERSON HE MIGHT APPOINT,--POOR SHABBY FELLOW THAT HE IS
DID SHE NOT CAUSE--AH BARON SAID MURPHY LEAVING THE SENTENCE UNFINISHED THIS WOMAN IS OUR EVIL GENIUS
AS RODOLPH PASSED BEFORE A DOOR SO SINGULARLY INDICATIVE OF ALL HIS WORST SUSPICIONS HE FANCIED HE COULD DETECT THE SOUND OF SMOTHERED SOBS FROM WITHIN
AH MUSETTE MUSETTE I SHALL BE ALWAYS FEEDING YOU AND PATTING YOU TO MAKE YOU KNOW ME NOW WE WILL FINISH THE INSIDE OF YOUR APARTMENT FLEUR-DE-MARIE
AND KNOWING AS I DO HOW JUSTLY ODIOUS THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS MAN WAS TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS I STUDIOUSLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL REFERENCE TO IT THE FEATURES OF RODOLPH WERE AGAIN OVERSHADOWED WITH GLOOM AND PLUNGED IN DEEP REVERIE HE CONTINUED TO PRESERVE UNBROKEN THE SILENCE WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THE CARRIAGE STOPPED IN THE COURTYARD OF THE EMBASSY
WHAT PASSIONATE EXPRESSION DID HE NOT THROW INTO THE WORDS OF THAT BEAUTIFUL DUET SO DESCRIPTIVE OF HIS LOVE AND HIS FEAR OF OFFENDING HER WHO WAS THE OBJECT OF IT BY REVEALING IT LET ME ENTREAT OF YOU SAID MADAME D'HARVILLE AFTER A LONG SILENCE TO SPEAK OF SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN IMAGINE YOUR SURPRISE
THIS WORD IN THE SLANG OF THEFT AND MURDER SIGNIFIES A DRINKING-SHOP OF THE LOWEST CLASS
I AM REALLY ASHAMED BECAUSE I AM KIND NO
OH DEFEND ME CRIED FLEUR-DE-MARIE TO RODOLPH CLASPING HER HANDS
R THE HERALDIC SUPPORTERS AND THE CROSS OF HONOUR
BRAS ROUGE I WOULD HAVE SCRATCHED IT ALL OFF AS WELL AS THIS PALETTE FILLED WITH HORRID MONSTERS WITH THEIR EQUALLY ABOMINABLE MASTER WHOM YOU CAN SEE DRAWN AMONGST THEM
BUT WITH YOUR KIND PERMISSION I WILL AWAIT HIS RETURN
AND YET YOU ARE NOT UNHAPPY THERE ARE WORSE THAN I AM
SACRILEGE
WHY MY DEAR SIR THE AIR OF PARIS--BUT LET US TALK SERIOUSLY
BUT BE EASY
AND BECAUSE HAVING THUS EXPIATED AND AS I MAY SAY RANSOMED YOURSELF FROM A GREAT CRIME YOUR RESTITUTION TO SOCIETY WOULD BE MORE NOBLE MORE COMPLETE MORE HEROIC IF IT WERE WORKED OUT IN THE MIDST OF PERILS IN AN UNCONQUERED CLIME THAN IN THE MIDST OF THE QUIET INHABITANTS OF A LITTLE TOWN
I WILL TELL YOU PRESENTLY WHICH ROAD TO TAKE THE COACH WENT ON
HE SENDS TO ME HIS MORTAL ENEMY WHOM HE OVERWHELMED WITH INSULTS AND CONTINUALLY OUTRAGED IN EVERY WAY TO BEG A LOCK OF MY HAIR,--A FAVOUR WHICH EVEN LADIES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO REFUSE TO A LOVER BUT SUPPOSING THIS CABRION HAD BEEN AS GOOD A LODGER AS WAS M
IT WAS JUST THE SAME WITH THE TRAVELLING-CLERK WE HAD HERE BEFORE CABRION AND SO IT WAS WHEN M
YES I DARESAY HE MAY EXPECT A LONG TIME FIRST I RATHER THINK NOBODY CAME THEN LISTEN
TWAS THE PAY OF AN ADJUTANT SUB-OFFICER
INDEED INDEED I MUST OR--OR SHE WILL CONSIDER ME A THIEF
I WAS ON THE LOOKOUT IN A MATTER OF YOURS MASTER
A SIMILAR NOTE CAME FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE HOVEL
WHY SHE IS A NEEDLEWOMAN ALSO LIVING ON THE FOURTH FLOOR CRIED MADAME PIPELET
MURPHY BUT YOU SAID THEN THAT I MUST NOT LOOK SO LIKE A BEGGAR AS THAT WOULD FRIGHTEN THE EMPLOYER TO WHOM YOU WOULD TAKE ME
IN THIS CASE IT IS MOST APPLICABLE
HE IS THEN WOUNDED UNHAPPILY MY LORD HE IS WHERE IS HE
THEN REFLECTING THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO EXPOSE HIM TO GREAT DANGER SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE NO NO DO NOT MOVE MISTER RODOLPH
FOR EVEN CRIME HAS ITS AMBITION AND YOURS HAS LONG CONSISTED IN A PRE-EMINENCE IN VICIOUS DEEDS AND MONSTROUS VICES WHILE YOUR IRON FRAME WOULD ALIKE DEFY THE LABOURS OF THE OAR OR THE CHASTISEMENT OF THOSE SET OVER YOU
GET ALL READY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
BRAS ROUGE ALSO CARRIES A PARCEL OF SOME SIZE BENEATH HIS CLOAK AND THAT THEY ALWAYS RETURN EMPTY-HANDED AND WHAT CAN THESE PACKETS CONTAIN THE LORD ABOVE KNOWS FOR I DON'T
SHE NEVER GOES WITHOUT HER WAX SAID THE BRIGAND
AFTER A FEW DAYS ALTHOUGH UNABLE TO DISCOVER THE REASON OF A CHANGE WHICH SO DEEPLY AFFLICTED HIM THE WORTHY SQUIRE FOUND RODOLPH CHILLED AND CONSTRAINED IN HIS DEMEANOUR TOWARDS HIM AND ALMOST RUDE WHEN HE RECALLED TO HIM HIS SEQUESTERED AND RURAL LIFE
CHAPTER XXV
IF THE LITTLE TORTILLARD CRIPPLE IS THERE YOU HAD BETTER TAKE HIM WITH YOU
NO I THANK YOU
GO ON WELL THEN I ASKED THE OGRESS TO LET ME GO OUT AND TAKE MY ROSE-TREE FOR A WALK AS I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A CHILD OUT
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ENTREATIES OF MLLE
THERE ARE POOR LABOURERS WHO HAVE BEEN HONEST ALL THEIR LIVES AND WHO I KNOW IT AND IT MAY BE I HAVE DONE FOR MANY OTHERS MORE THAN I AM DOING FOR YOU
WHY ONLY IMAGINE M
WHAT COULD INDUCE THE WRETCH TO CARRY OFF YOUR SON FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE INTO A FOREIGN LAND
YOU SEE I DO NOT WISH TO CONCEAL ANYTHING,--I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I KNOW
ALFRED GENERALLY READS MY LETTERS FOR ME BECAUSE I DO NOT HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO READ THEM MYSELF
HIS COMPANION ENFEEBLED DEJECTED WITH LIVID ASPECT AND PALE LIPS HIS LOWER JAW FALLEN AND SHAKING CONVULSIVELY MADE NO RESISTANCE BUT HELD OUT HIS HANDS TO BE ENCLASPED BY THE HANDCUFFS
YOU APPOINTED ME TO MEET YOU THIS MORNING AT THE PORTE ST DENIS AT DAYBREAK
THE EXACT ADDRESS IS ALSO IN MY POCKETBOOK
BUT WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
THE BRIG WAS UNDER DANISH COLOURS
RODOLPH SAW HER PROFILE AND HER GREEN EYE HOOKED NOSE SKINNY LIPS PEAKED CHIN AND COUNTENANCE AT ONCE WICKED AND CUNNING REMINDED HIM INVOLUNTARILY OF LA CHOUETTE THAT HORRIBLE OLD WRETCH WHO HAD MADE POOR FLEUR-DE-MARIE HER VICTIM
AS HIS SENSES BECAME MORE CLEAR SO DID THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN THE UNFORTUNATE VICTIM RETURN TO HIS IMAGINATION
WHERE SAYS I
SARAH CAME TOWARDS HER AND IT REQUIRED ALL THE DEEP RESPECT DUE TO THE GRAND DUCHESS TO REPRESS THE MURMUR OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION WHEN THE YOUNG LADY CROSSED THE ROOM
WHY DID HE TEAR HIM FROM ME THAT MYSTERY I CANNOT FATHOM SAID RODOLPH WITH A PENSIVE AIR
THIS ABSENCE DOUBLY AUSPICIOUS TO THE VIEWS OF SARAH ALLOWED HER TO ARRANGE AT HER EASE THE PRINCIPAL THREADS OF THE FILLET SHE WAS WEAVING WITHOUT BEING DETERRED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE YOUNG PRINCE WHOSE TOO OPEN ADMIRATION MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE AWAKENED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE GRAND DUKE
SHE SAID ALL THIS WITH SO SERIOUS AND PERSUASIVE A TONE
YET WHEN WE RECALL CERTAIN EVENTS EVEN IN OUR OWN TIMES FROM HIGH AND MOST REPUTABLE MORGANATIC MARRIAGES BETWEEN SOVEREIGNS AND FEMALE SUBJECTS DOWN TO THE LOVING ELOPEMENT OF MISS PENELOPE SMITH AND THE PRINCE OF CAPUA WE CANNOT REFUSE SOME CHANCE OF FORTUNATE RESULT TO THE IMAGINATION OF SEYTON AND SARAH
SHE ONLY SAID IN A CALM TONE GIVE UP YOUR PURSE BROTHER AND THEN ACCOSTING THE ROBBER WE WILL MAKE NO NOISE
THE RAIN HAD CEASED FOR A MOMENT BUT THE CLOUDS DRIVEN BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND WERE SO DARK AND SO LOW THAT IT WAS ALMOST NIGHT IN APPEARANCE
THIS IS A BLADE
YOU YES FOR ALL YOU DOUBT IT
OH THAT IDEA IS DREADFUL
DOES WHAT I GIVE YOU THEN SEEM BEYOND YOUR HOPES INQUIRED RODOLPH
AND THERE ARE SOME MEN PLOUGHING THE LAND
MLLE
AND WHEN I CAME OF AGE HE BROUGHT ME IN HIS DEBTOR FOR THIRTY FRANCS
ASSASSIN
BUT HE WOULD RATHER HAVE KILLED HIS SISTER THAN SEE HER THE MISTRESS OF A PRINCE EVEN THOUGH THE LIAISON SHOULD TERMINATE IN A MARRIAGE OF REPARATION
I DON'T KNOW HER SAID THE CHOURINEUR WHO APPEARED TO BE APPEALING TO HIS MEMORY
BUT THROUGH THE INTERFERENCE OF MONSEIGNEUR HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HER TO BE IMMURED FOR LIFE IN A PRISON AND IT IS THENCE THAT MONSEIGNEUR NOW SEEKS TO HAVE HER RELEASED,--TO YOUR GREAT ASTONISHMENT AS WELL AS MINE MY DEAR BARON
I AM HERE IN THIS DEAR SPOT WHERE YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH GOOD
IT IS ALL RIGHT MY MAN,--I'VE DONE THE TRICK CRIED THE ONE-EYED HAG AS SHE ENTERED
IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE ORIGINAL OF THIS GLOWING PICTURE WAS AT LEAST FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
HER MATERNITY WAS ONLY WITH HER A MEANS OF ACTING MORE EFFECTUALLY ON RODOLPH AND HAD NO SOFTENING EFFECT ON HER IRON SOUL
I RAN INTO THE GARDEN BUT THUNDER AND LIGHTNING M
TWO OR THREE TIMES HAVING MET RODOLPH'S FIXED LOOK SHE TURNED AWAY UNABLE TO ACCOUNT TO HERSELF FOR THE SINGULAR IMPRESSION WHICH THE UNKNOWN HAD CAUSED HER
GO WITH HIM BY ALL MEANS THE CHOURINEUR APPROACHED THE SCHOOLMASTER AND LAID HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
MY DEAR DE GRAUEN PERHAPS BUT FOR THESE INTRODUCTIONS MANY MISFORTUNES WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED FOR THEN MONSEIGNEUR WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THIS WOMAN
WHAT A WOMAN SHE IS
RODOLPH WHAT A GOOD PAINTER YOU ARE NOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU WILL PASS YOUR DAY YES YES LET US SEE HOW I SHALL EMPLOY MYSELF ALL DAY EARLY IN THE MORNING YOUR GOOD AUNT WAKES YOU WITH A TENDER KISS
COME EAT GOUALEUSE EAT
L'ABBE SAID RODOLPH RESPECTFULLY MADAME GEORGES HAS UNDERTAKEN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THIS YOUNG GIRL FOR WHOM I ALSO BEG YOUR KINDNESS SHE IS ENTITLED TO IT SIR LIKE ALL WHO COME TO US
OF ANOTHER LIFE IN ETERNITY WHERE MAN WAS NO LONGER THE BEAST OF BURDEN,--THE PROPERTY,--THE THING OF HIS FELLOW MAN BUT WHERE THE VICTIMS OF THIS WORLD WERE SO HAPPY THAT THEY PRAYED IN HEAVEN FOR THEIR TORMENTORS
THE LEVIN BOLT STRIKES SPLITS AND RENDS THE DEEPLY PLANTED TREE
THE DEPARTURE 221 XXI
OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TAKE YOU TO THE OGRESS'S SHE
I MUST HAVE IT
HE CALCULATED THE PROBABLE DURATION OF HIS MORTAL AGONY,--OF THE PERIOD WHICH MUST ELAPSE ERE THIS SLOW INCH-LIKE DEATH WOULD PUT A PERIOD TO HIS MISERY
I DON'T THINK IT RAINS NOW SAID RODOLPH LIGHTING HIS CIGAR
THE GOUALEUSE HAD HARDLY LISTENED TO THE CHOURINEUR
THE ONE-EYED HAG DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE A THIEF OR NOT NO NOT UNLESS THE SCHOOLMASTER HAS TALKED OF ME TO HER AND TOLD HER THAT I DID NOT DO BUSINESS IN THAT LINE IF HE HAVE YOU MUST APPEAR TO HAVE ALTERED YOUR IDEAS ON THAT SUBJECT I YES TEN THOUSAND THUNDERS
YOU MY POOR GIRL WERE AT LAST TAKEN TO BY THE CHOUETTE WHOM THE DEVIL CONFOUND
I HARDLY KNOW YOU AGAIN WE WILL RELATE HEREAFTER THE RESULTS OF THIS DISCOVERY WHICH LED TO GREAT AND TERRIBLE EVENTS
THE GROS-BOITEUX HAS PERHAPS STAYED TO GIVE THAT YOUNG FELLOW GERMAIN WHO LIVES IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE HIS GRUEL SAID HE TO HIS COMPANION
MOST DECIDEDLY
THE SCAFFOLD COMES NEXT IN CONSIDERATION IT IS MY LIFE THEN YOU SEEK CRIED THE RUFFIAN
HERE THEY ARE,--THE SCHOOLMASTER AND HIS COMPANION
AND SO THANKS TO HIS POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION SARAH OF HALSBURY AND HER BROTHER WERE RECEIVED AT THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN WITH EVERY DISTINCTION AND WITH MARKED KINDNESS
LACOUR OF PARIS ACCOMPLISHED YOU IN SINGLE-STICK WRESTLING AND SLANG SO AS TO RENDER YOU FULLY PROVIDED FOR YOUR VENTURESOME EXCURSIONS
THE SAME DAY ON WHICH THE CONVERSATION PASSED BETWEEN THE BARON DE GRAUEN AND MURPHY RODOLPH PLAINLY AND UNPRETENDINGLY DRESSED WENDED HIS WAY ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK ON A GLOOMY NOVEMBER AFTERNOON TOWARDS THE RUE DU TEMPLE
RODOLPH WITH MUCH KINDNESS SAID TO HIM
BECAUSE YOU COULD AT THE SAME TIME DISPLAY YOUR NATURAL INTREPIDITY
WELL WHEN THE OLD WOMAN TOOK MY HAND I BURST OUT INTO A PERSPIRATION FROM HEAD TO FOOT
YES I AM SURE I KNOW HER YOU SIR WALTER MURPHY REPLIED THE BARON MUCH AMUSED
RODOLPH,--TO COMPEL ME TO SEND HIM MONEY
YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE 74 VIII
WELL MADAME GEORGES WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARIE INQUIRED RODOLPH
I HOPE AND BELIEVE IT WILL SOON BE BETTER YOU ARE RIGHT
THIS FEAR WAS ANOTHER MOTIVE WITH THE COLONIST FOR USING DAVID IN THE MOST SHAMEFUL MANNER AND ENTIRELY PREVENTING HIM FROM EFFECTING THE MALICIOUS DESIGNS OF WHICH HE SUSPECTED HIM CONSIDERING HIM AS ACTUATED BY AN IRREPRESSIBLE AMOUNT OF TERROR THIS CONDUCT SEEMS LESS STUPID BUT QUITE AS FEROCIOUS A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE EVENTS WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA
IN A CRACK THE DOOR IS OPENED
YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT HARM A CHILD,--IT WAS ONLY MY JOKE
NAY I EVEN BELIEVE THE MEETING WITH THE CHOURINEUR MAY BE USEFUL TO YOU DID NOT THIS MAN PASS AMONGST THE INHABITANTS OF THE TAPIS-FRANC AS POSSESSING SOME GOOD POINTS AMONG HIS MANY BAD ONES INDEED I KNOW NOT M
BARON FIE IT IS ALL VERY WELL MY LORD SAID THE BARON STURDILY
IT WILL BE LATE BEFORE WE MEET FOR I AM SURE THAT MONSEIGNEUR WILL GO THIS VERY DAY TO PAY A VISIT TO THE MYSTERIOUS HOUSE IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE CHAPTER XXIII
NOW THEN SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT,--HOW YOU DISCOVERED THE CELLAR
NOTHING HE REPLIED ABRUPTLY
I OFTEN MEET HER IN SOCIETY AND ALTHOUGH SHE IS CONSTANTLY SURROUNDED BY ADMIRERS AS EVERY YOUNG AND LOVELY WOMAN IS STILL HER REPUTATION IS UNSULLIED THE MARQUIS IS ALWAYS SPEAKING OF HER IN THE HIGHEST TERMS
WHAT A SCAMP HE WAS
THE FLOOR COMPOSED OF EARTH BEATEN TOGETHER WITH SALTPETRE WAS THICK WITH DIRT
IT WAS MY AMBITION AND MY AMBITION RUINED ME
REALLY MY DEAR DE GRAUEN RESUMED RODOLPH I KNOW NOT HOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WEIGHT OF YOUR COMPLIMENT OR HOW TO REPAY SUCH DELICATE FLATTERY IN ITS OWN WAY MY LORD LET ME ENTREAT OF YOU NOT TO TAKE THE TROUBLE EXCLAIMED THE BARON WHO HAD FOR THE INSTANT FORGOTTEN THAT RODOLPH WHO DETESTED EVERY SPECIES OF FLATTERY ALWAYS REVENGED HIMSELF BY THE MOST UNSPARING RAILLERY ON THOSE WHO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ADDRESSED IT TO HIM
WHAT AILS YOU FLEUR-DE-MARIE
YOU OUGHT TO DIE ON THIS SPOT
AND MY NEIGHBOURS NEVER COMPLAIN OF THE NOISE WHICH IS MADE IN MY HOUSE I MUST AGREE TO ALL YOU WISH YOUNG MAN CONTINUED THE SCHOOLMASTER
PIPELET I MUST NOT LET YOU THUS EXCITE YOURSELF
SHE THEN HAD A HALF PINT OF BRANDY AT THE BAR THE DEUCE
INSTEAD OF HITTING GOUALEUSE HOWEVER I STUMBLED ON MASTER RODOLPH WHO SOON GAVE ME BETTER THAN I SENT
RODOLPH NOW FOUND HIMSELF COMPELLED TO ASSUME A STANDING POSITION THOUGH IN SO DOING HIS FOREHEAD WAS BROUGHT IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE VERY TOP OF THE VAULT
HE HAD EXPECTED IT
THE MURKY-COLOURED HOUSES WHICH WERE LIGHTED WITHIN BY A FEW PANES OF GLASS IN THE WORM-EATEN CASEMENTS OVERHUNG EACH OTHER SO CLOSELY THAT THE EAVES OF EACH ALMOST TOUCHED ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR SO NARROW WERE THE STREETS
GERMAIN HAD MADE HIM TAKE A GOOD PULL AT HIS WINE TO PUT AS HE USED TO SAY A LITTLE LIFE AND SOUL INTO HIS HALF-EXHAUSTED BODY AND THE SURGEON-DENTIST WHAT DID HE DO FOR THIS WRETCHED FAMILY M
HIS CHIN RATHER PROJECTING WAS PARTLY CONCEALED IN A HIGH CRAVAT OF WHITE MUSLIN STARCHED VERY STIFFLY AND OF UNIMPEACHABLE WHITENESS
I SEE ALL ABOUT IT 8 RECEIVER OF STOLEN GOODS
I CRY YOUR MERCY BEHOLD HIM MURPHY AND SAY WHETHER APOLLO COULD DISPLAY MORE GRACEFUL LIMBS MORE LIGHT AND YOUTHFUL PROPORTIONS I BESEECH YOU MY LORD TO PARDON ME FROM THE RECOLLECTION OF HOW LONG IT IS SINCE I HAVE PERMITTED MYSELF TO UTTER THE SLIGHTEST COMPLIMENT TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS OBSERVE MURPHY THIS BAND OF GOLD WHICH RESTRAINS WITHOUT CONCEALING THE LOCKS OF RICH BLACK HAIR FLOWING OVER THIS GRACEFUL NECK AND MY LORD
AH AH COMRADE
BY THIS TIME YOU WILL HAVE ALMOST TIRED YOURSELF AND GATHERING A LARGE HANDFUL OF WILD HERBS CAREFULLY SELECTED BY YOU AS THE KNOWN FAVOURITES OF YOUR DEAR MUSETTE YOU TURN YOUR STEPS HOMEWARDS BUT WE GO BACK THROUGH THE MEADOW DEAR M
YOU WILL FIND IN THAT POCKETBOOK WHEREWITHAL TO PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A HOME AND THE MEANS OF LIVING FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR DAYS
WHY ALL THE RETURNS ARE EMPLOYED NOT ONLY IN AMELIORATING THE CONDITION OF THE LABOURERS WHO CONSIDER THE OCCUPATION ON THIS MODEL FARM AS A GREAT FAVOUR BUT MOREOVER TO SUCCOUR ALL THE NEEDY IN THE DISTRICT
I AM EQUALLY GLAD TO SEE YOU OH WHAT A JOKER M
THEY WOULD BE SOMEWHAT ASTONISHED I FANCY MUCH IN THE SAME DEGREE AS THE SURPRISE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WOULD EXCITE AMONG YOUR NEW ACQUAINTANCES IN THE RUE DU TEMPLE WERE YOU TO PROCEED THITHER AS NOW ATTIRED TO PAY A FRIENDLY VISIT TO MADAME PIPELET AND TO INQUIRE AFTER THE HEALTH OF CABRION'S VICTIM THE POOR MELANCHOLY ALFRED MY LORD HAS DRAWN SO LIVELY A SKETCH OF ALFRED ATTIRED IN HIS LONG-SKIRTED GREEN COAT AND BELL-CROWNED HAT SAID THE BARON THAT I CAN WELL IMAGINE HIM SEATED IN MAGISTERIAL DIGNITY IN HIS DARK AND SMOKY LODGE
YOU HAVE TO-NIGHT DEFIED GOD TO CARRY OFF YOUR TWO VICTIMS BEFORE THEIR DEATH AND HE HAS TAKEN THEM SAID MONSEIGNEUR
NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARMING THAN THE COMBINATION OF INNOCENCE AND PURE JOY WHICH BEAMED ON HER EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ON HEARING WILLIS'S FEARFUL NARRATION THOUGHT THE MAN WAS EITHER DRUNK OR A LIAR
THE SCHOOLMASTER HAD REMARKED IN THE NEXT ROOM TWO MEN ARMED WITH CARBINES
ONLY SEE HER
GLASSES SET IN GOLD AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN MENTION ALL BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO ASTONISH YOU
LOOK M
SCOUNDREL
I KNOW YOU NOW AS WELL AS IF I WERE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER AND YOU HAD NEVER LEFT MY LAP
NOW I THINK OF IT THERE IS A PERSON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE LIVING AT PORT ST NICOLAS HAS A MOTHER A VERY WORTHY WOMAN BUT IN HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES RESIDING AT ST MANDE
MERCY
MERCY
AND IF HE IS OVER-REACHED I OUGHT TO GO TO BRAS ROUGE'S AND SEE FOR HIM
HE MADE ME CHANGE HIS NOTES FOR GOLD AND BUY A BELT WHICH I SEWED ROUND HIS BODY AND IN WHICH I PUT HIS MOPUSES AND THEN GOOD DAY
FIND HIM OUT THOUGH IF YOU CAN
RIGOLETTE EXCEPTING HER PERMITTING HERSELF TO BE WHEEDLED OVER BY THAT VILE SCAMP CABRION BUT YOU KNOW ALFRED THAT NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW HARMLESS ATTENTIONS PASSED BETWEEN THEM INTERRUPTED THE PORTERESS
I SHALL MAKE YOU MY WIFE SOME DAY OR OTHER SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER
RIGOLETTE SHOULD BE THE ONLY PERSON ENTRUSTED WITH THE SECRET OF M
WE MUST DEVISE A MORE TERRIFIC METHOD OF ATONEMENT FOR YOU
THE TWO VICTIMS WERE CARRIED ON BOARD SO QUIETLY THAT THEY WERE NOT PERCEIVED
YOU PERHAPS M
NO WORDS CAN ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE LOVELINESS OF HER PERSON AND THE MARQUISE D'HARVILLE WAS THEN IN THE FIRST BLOOM OF YOUTHFUL CHARMS
THANKS TO THE FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER HONOURED HIM THE DECEASED MARQUIS D'HARVILLE WAS ENABLED TO RENDER MOST EFFECTUAL SERVICE TO THE FATHER OF OUR PATRON
MOTHER BURETTE IS AS GREAT A BRUTE IN HER WAY AS HER LOVER M
NO NO ANSWERED THE POOR GIRL TREMBLING AT THE VERY RECOLLECTION
COME AND DRINK WITH US
MY CURSES UPON YOU FOR YOUR MEDDLING INTERFERENCE
IF IT WERE SO SHOULD YOU NOT BE DELIGHTED TO BE RESTORED TO YOUR PARENTS ALAS SIR
LET ME TELL YOU A PERSON MUST TRULY LOVE TO BEAR ALL THIS AND EVEN TO BE CARELESS ABOUT CONCEALING HIS SUFFERINGS FROM THE WORLD FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN DO NOT SPEAK THUS REPLIED MADAME D'HARVILLE IN A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION
AT THE DOOR I FOUND THE OGRESS HERE AND TWO OR THREE OLD WOMEN WHO HAD COME TO SEE MY FELLOW PRISONERS AND WHO HAD ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT WHEN I LEFT THE PRISON THEY WOULD FIND WORK FOR ME YES YES I SEE SAID THE CHOURINEUR
THE CHOUETTE WENT OUT
IT IS TO DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY
IT WAS DARK IT RAINED POURING
YOU CANNOT FIND THE WAY OUT BY YOURSELF
BUT WHEN IT DIED WHAT A LOSS IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO YOU I CRIED HEARTILY FOR IT GRIEVED ME VERY VERY MUCH
IT WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
AS I WENT I MEANT TO TAKE TORTILLARD FROM HIS CABBAGE-BED AS IT WAS ON MY ROAD
I AM NOT THIRSTY DO AS YOU LIKE,--I AM FOR A DRAIN OF BRANDY SAID THE RUFFIAN
SOMEBODY THREATENS YOU WITH SOMETHING AND I WILL COME ACROSS THEM IF I CAN
THE STONES OF THE LOUVRE THE LIME-KILNS OF CLICHY AND THE QUARRIES OF MONTROUGE THESE WERE THE HOTELS OF MY YOUTH
FOR ALWAYS HEARING AT HIS SIDE THE TINKLING OF THIS OLD CRACKED BELL SHINING AND CHATTERING,--CONTINUALLY SEEING THIS SOAP-BUBBLE SO PUFFED UP WITH NOTHINGNESS SO MAGNIFICENTLY VARIEGATED AND AS SUCH PORTRAYING THE THEATRICAL AND PUERILE PHASE OF SOVEREIGN POWER,--HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FEELS THE MORE SENSIBLY THE VANITY OF THOSE BARREN POMPS AND GLORIES OF THE WORLD AND BY CONTRAST HAS OFTEN DERIVED THE MOST SERIOUS AND HAPPY IDEAS FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS USELESS AND PATTERING CHAMBERLAIN WELL WELL
THE DRAUGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
ASK THE CHOURINEUR
I LISTENED,--IT WAS THE CHOUETTE
AND I WOULD SOONER DIE OF HUNGER THAN ROB
BUT THAT'S ENOUGH
THAT'S ALL MY TALE M
IT REQUIRED THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE TO SNATCH DAVID AND CECILY FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
CHARLES ROBERT A SUPERIOR OFFICER OF THE NATIONAL GUARD,--A YOUNG AND HANDSOME MAN IN HIGH REPUTE WITH A CERTAIN CLASS OF SOCIETY
MAKE YOURSELF EASY
IT HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED THAT MADAME SERAPHIN AND THE NOTARY JACQUES FERRAND ARE BOTH LIVING
SOPHESUS SARCOPHAGUS CURTAINS ALL SILK
THROUGH THE WINDOWS WITH THEIR GREEN BLINDS WHICH WERE HALF OPENED WAS TO BE SEEN THE MEADOW THE LITTLE STREAM AND BEYOND IT THE BANK PLANTED WITH CHESTNUT-TREES
TELL ME YOUR STORY AND GOUALEUSE WILL ALSO TELL HERS VERY WELL REPLIED THE CHOURINEUR
SHE IS A FIRST-RATE MANAGER
DE LAGNY WHO PREVIOUS TO THE REVOLUTION POSSESSED CONSIDERABLE PROPERTY IN LANGUEDOC AND WHO HAVING FORTUNATELY ESCAPED THE PROSCRIPTION SO FATAL TO MANY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE FIRST TRANQUILLITY WHICH SUCCEEDED THESE DAYS OF DISCORD AND ANARCHY TO ESTABLISH HIS ONLY DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT AND I RUNG AT A SIDE DOOR WHICH OPENS OUTWARDS AND HERE'S ABOUT TWO INCHES OF SPACE BETWEEN IT AND THE SILL
THE BELDAM SAT WITH HER FACE TOWARDS RODOLPH AND THE BRIGAND
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME IN THE MIDDLE OF MY WORK
IT WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT THAT SHE WOULD SECURE AN IMMENSE INFLUENCE OVER A HEART SUBMITTED TO THE WITCHING SPELL OF A FIRST LOVE
PERHAPS HIS DETESTATION OF THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CHOUETTE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS FEELING
I ASSURE YOU I HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO GRIEVE ABOUT,--IT IS ONLY A FANCY
BRADAMANTI SAID THE PORTERESS
HIS ROUGH FEATURES EXHIBITED THE DEEPEST COMPASSION FOR HIS FALLEN FOE AND APPROACHING RODOLPH HE SAID IN A LOW TONE
YOU CAME INTO THE FIELD AND POOR GOUALEUSE CAME AND SAT DOWN ON THE VERY EDGE OF MY PARK AND THEN I DETERMINED TO HAVE A BIT OF FUN AND JUMPING OUT OF MY LAIR I CALLED OUT LIKE A MAN ON FIRE AND NOW WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO TO WAIT FOR THE CHOUETTE WHO IS SURE TO COME FIRST
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
AND THIS HE WILL DO THE MORE RELUCTANTLY AS HIS GREAT DESIRE TO DISCOVER IT AROSE OUT OF HIS ARDENT FRIENDSHIP FOR M
RODOLPH HOW HAPPY I AM
THERE IS SEVENTEEN FRANCS TEN SOUS COMING TO YOU
LET US SAY NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT ALAS
I THINK WITH FOURLINE TO-NIGHT OR NEVER RODOLPH WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME ANXIETY
WHY MOTHER SAID RODOLPH TO THE OLD HAG YOU HAVE GOT SOME HOLY BOXWOOD I SEE OVER YOUR CUCKOO AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGER TO THE CONSECRATED BOUGH BEHIND THE OLD CLOCK
I FORGOT TO MENTION MY DEAR MADAME GEORGES SAID RODOLPH WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE THAT MARIE HAS I FEAR VERY WEAK LUNGS,--PRIVATIONS AND MISERY HAVE TRIED HER HEALTH
THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
THERE THE DUKE SEES US
HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY 246 XXIII
RODOLPH HE ADDED WITH A SADDENED AIR I DO NOT FORGET THAT SINCE I KNEW YOU IT WAS YOU WHO SAID TO ME THOSE TWO WORDS,'YOU HAVE BOTH HEART AND HONOUR IT IS ASTONISHING HOW I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
TORTILLARD SAYS SHE IN A LOW VOICE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
YOU ARE FREE
YOU ARE FREE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LEARN THE FATE OF MY BOY
AN OLD PRIEST THE SYMBOL OF CHARITY PARDON AND EVERLASTING HOPE
I HAVE GOOD LEGS AND MY EMPLOYER WILL WAIT FOR ME
A YOUNG GIRL HARDLY OUT OF HER INFANCY AND BUT RECENTLY THROWN INTO AN ABYSS OF VICE THROUGH MISERY AND THE CLOSE CONTACT WITH CRIME
IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT HE CAME MOST OPPORTUNELY AND GENEROUSLY TO HER ASSISTANCE INDUCED HER TO QUIT PARIS AND ESTABLISH HERSELF AT THE FARM AT BOUQUEVAL WHERE SHE NOW IS WITH THE GOUALEUSE
I WENT TOWARDS IT AND BY JOVE
