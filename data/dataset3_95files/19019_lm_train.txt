IN OTHER CASES IT MAY BE COLLAPSED EMPTY AND ULCERATED

AN IMPROVEMENT ON THIS TEST IS THE USE OF FORMIC ACID ALONE
AND AS ARSENITE OF COPPER OR SCHEELE'S GREEN
THERE IS BUT LITTLE TENDENCY TO CARRY IN PORTIONS OF CLOTHING OR SEPTIC MATERIAL AND THE WOUND HEALS BY FIRST INTENTION IF REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS BE TAKEN

A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENTS OF THE STOMACH ETC IN SUSPECTED CASES OF POISONING IS USUALLY DONE BY A SPECIAL ANALYST NAMED BY THE CORONER
THIS EVIDENCE IS WHAT ANY LAY OBSERVER MIGHT BE ASKED

THIS MEANS THAT A HUMAN BEING HAS BEEN KILLED BY ANOTHER MALICIOUSLY AND DELIBERATELY OR WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD OF CONSEQUENCES
LUNGS IN WHICH RESPIRATION HAS TAKEN PLACE FLOAT IN WATER
THESE TESTS ARE DIFFICULT TO APPLY BUT AS ARSENIC IS A UBIQUITOUS POISON AND AS THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF FALLACY IT WOULD BE WELL WHEN POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES OF AN EXPERT
