AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT THIS STORY IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR IN ANY FORM IN THE NORTH GERMAN CYCLE OF ROMANCE

WHEN THE KINGS ON THE SEACOASTS OF PALESTINE AND ASIA MINOR FOUND THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER LOOK TO EGYPT FOR HELP THEY RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO THE INEVITABLE AND CEASED TO INTRIGUE AGAINST ASSYRIA

MERODACH ACCORDING TO THE PRIESTS WAS ANGRY
IN EGYPT THE DRAGON SURVIVES IN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED MYTHOLOGY OF THE SUN CULT OF HELIOPOLIS AND AS SUN WORSHIP IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTED AND THE SUN DEITY IS A MALE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THAT THE NIGHT DEMON APEP WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF SET
IT IS HE WHO STOOD FORTH AGAINST THE REBELLIOUS MONSTERS OF DARKNESS WHO WOULD WREST THE DOMINION OF THE WORLD FROM THE GODS WHO HELD THEIR CONCLAVE ON THE MOUNTAIN
AT FIRST THE GUTTURAL H WHICH GIVES THE ENGLISH RENDERING KHAMMURABI PRESENTED A SERIOUS DIFFICULTY BUT IN TIME THE FORM AMMURAPI WHICH APPEARS ON A TABLET BECAME KNOWN AND THE CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT THE SOFTER H SOUND WAS USED AND NOT THE GUTTURAL

HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ART FOR ART'S SAKE HIS OBJECT IN SINGING APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN INTENSELY PRACTICAL
HAVING SECURED THE SUPPORT OF THE CAPTAINS OF THE ROYAL GUARD AND A PORTION OF THE ARMY HE BROUGHT OUT FROM THE TEMPLE THE SEVEN YEARS OLD PRINCE JOASH THE KING'S SON AND PUT UPON HIM THE CROWN AND GAVE HIM THE TESTIMONY AND MADE HIM KING
TAMMUZ IN HIS CHARACTER AS A PATRIARCH MAY HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS A HOSTAGE FROM THE GODS

HE FIRST SAW THE BIRD PERCHED ON HIS BREAST AND THEN SITTING ON A MYRTLE TREE".[490 THE DOVE WAS NOT ONLY A SYMBOL OF SEMIRAMIS BUT ALSO OF HER MOTHER DERCETO THE PHOENICIAN FISH GODDESS

THE LAST DAYS OF ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA PREFACE THIS VOLUME DEALS WITH THE MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA AND AS THESE REFLECT THE CIVILIZATION IN WHICH THEY DEVELOPED A HISTORICAL NARRATIVE HAS BEEN PROVIDED BEGINNING WITH THE EARLY SUMERIAN AGE AND CONCLUDING WITH THE PERIODS OF THE PERSIAN AND GRECIAN EMPIRES
ACCORDING TO THE CHRONICLE OF KISH HE WAS A SON OF SARGON
IN BABYLONIA THERE WERE TWO WEAK DYNASTIES IN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY AND THEREAFTER AN ELAMITE DYNASTY WHICH LASTED ABOUT SIX YEARS
MANY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES WHICH WILL THROW FRESH LIGHT ON THIS FASCINATING EARLY PERIOD REMAIN TO BE MADE IN THAT ANCIENT AND DESERTED LAND WHICH STILL LIES UNDER THE CURSE OF THE HEBREW PROPHET WHO EXCLAIMED
THEN THE LORD OF THE HIGH GODS SPLIT THE BODY OF THE DRAGON LIKE THAT OF A MASHDE FISH INTO TWO HALVES
IN TIME HOWEVER A NEW WORLD APPEARS
A GREAT CONSPIRACY WAS FOMENTED IN SEVERAL STATES AGAINST SENNACHERIB WHEN THE INTELLIGENCE OF SARGON'S DEATH WAS BRUITED ABROAD
CONSEQUENTLY WE FIND THAT BEHIND ALL SYSTEMS OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION LIES THE FORMATIVE BACKGROUND OF NATURAL PHENOMENA
SETI I THE SON OF RAMESES I AND THE THIRD PHARAOH OF THE POWERFUL NINETEENTH DYNASTY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INACTIVITY OF THE HITTITE RULER BY INVADING SOUTHERN SYRIA
BABYLON THE GREAT IS FALLEN IS FALLEN AND IS BECOME THE HABITATION OF DEVILS AND THE HOLD OF EVERY FOUL SPIRIT AND A CAGE OF EVERY UNCLEAN AND HATEFUL BIRD
AT ANY RATE IT IS OF INTEREST TO FIND IN THIS CONNECTION THAT IN EGYPT THE PLANET SATURN WAS HER-KA HORUS THE BULL NINIP WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED WITH THE BULL
THE SUN AND THE MOON WERE THE ABODES OF SPIRITS OR THE VESSELS IN WHICH GREAT SPIRITS SAILED OVER THE SEA OF THE SKY
WE GATHER FROM HIS COMPOSITION THAT BLOOD WAS SHED BY THE RAIDERS OF UMMA EVEN IN THE SACRED PRECINCTS OF TEMPLES THAT STATUES WERE SHATTERED THAT SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES WERE CARRIED AWAY THAT GRANARIES WERE PLUNDERED AND STANDING CROPS DESTROYED AND THAT MANY BUILDINGS WERE SET ON FIRE
THE DIRECTION OF THEIR FLOW MIGHT BE DIVERTED FOR A TIME BUT THEY ULTIMATELY OVERCAME EVERY OBSTACLE BY SHEER PERSISTENCY AND OVERPOWERING VOLUME

A SECOND RAID TO ELAM RESULTED IN THE RECOVERY OF THE STATUE OF MERODACH
NO DOUBT THE VARIOUS SECTIONS MOVED TOWARDS DISTRICTS WHICH WERE SUITABLE FOR THEIR HABITS OF LIFE
THE INDUSTRIOUS WERE PROTECTED AGAINST THE CARELESS
SHE WAS PROTECTED BY DOVES AND HER ASSYRIAN NAME SAMMU-RAMMAT IS BELIEVED TO BE DERIVED FROM SUMMAT"--"DOVE AND TO SIGNIFY THE DOVE GODDESS LOVETH HER SIMMAS THE CHIEF OF ROYAL SHEPHERDS FOUND THE CHILD AND ADOPTED HER

THE ARCADIANS BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE DESCENDED AS HESIOD RECORDED FROM A PRINCESS WHO WAS TRANSFORMED BY ZEUS INTO A BEAR
ANOTHER IMPORTANT CANAL THE SHATT EL HAI CROSSED THE PLAIN FROM THE TIGRIS TO ITS SISTER RIVER WHICH LIES LOWER AT THIS POINT AND DOES NOT RUN SO FAST
THE GODS SEIZED THEIR WEAPONS
THE BUCKETS OR SKIN BAGS WERE ROPED TO A WEIGHTED BEAM WITH THE AID OF WHICH THEY WERE SWUNG UP BY WORKMEN AND EMPTIED INTO THE CANALS
AMMONIA FOR INSTANCE WAS TAKEN WITH THE ORGANIC SUBSTANCES FOUND IN FARMYARDS

THOMPSON'S TRANSLATION._[79 EVEN AFTER THE GODS WERE GIVEN BENEFICENT ATTRIBUTES TO REFLECT THE GROWTH OF CULTURE AND WERE HUMANIZED THEY STILL RETAINED MANY OF THEIR SAVAGE CHARACTERISTICS

THESE CONTRAST SHARPLY WITH CHARACTERISTIC GERMANIC LEGENDS IN WHICH THE GIANT IS GREATER THAN THE GIANTESS AND THE DRAGON IS A MALE LIKE FAFNER WHO IS SLAIN BY SIGURD AND REGIN WHOM SIEGFRIED OVERCOMES
AN INSTANCE OF AN ADVANCED CULT SUDDENLY ACHIEVING PROMINENCE AS A RESULT OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE IS AFFORDED BY EGYPT WHERE THE FULLY DEVELOPED ATON RELIGION WAS EMBRACED AND ESTABLISHED AS A NATIONAL RELIGION BY AKHENATON THE SO-CALLED DREAMER THAT MIGRATIONS WERE SOMETIMES PROPELLED BY CULTS WHICH SOUGHT NEW AREAS IN WHICH TO EXERCISE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND PROPAGATE THEIR BELIEFS IS SUGGESTED BY THE INVASION OF INDIA AT THE CLOSE OF THE VEDIC PERIOD BY THE LATER COMERS WHO LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF BRAHMANISM

ALEXANDER WAS IMPRESSED BY THE WISDOM AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE ASTROLOGERS AND PRIESTS WHO HAD BECOME KNOWN AS CHALDAEANS AND ADDED BEL MERODACH TO HIS EXTRAORDINARY PANTHEON WHICH ALREADY INCLUDED AMON OF EGYPT MELKARTH AND JEHOVAH
THEY OVERRAN THE WHOLE OF SYRIA AND ENTERED INTO THE POSSESSION OF MESOPOTAMIA THUS ACQUIRING FULL CONTROL OF THE TRADE ROUTES TOWARDS THE WEST
AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS STAGE OF RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS IS AFFORDED BY MR RISLEY WHO IN DEALING WITH THE RELIGION OF THE JUNGLE DWELLERS OF CHOTA NAGPUR INDIA SAYS THAT IN MOST CASES THE INDEFINITE SOMETHING WHICH THEY FEAR AND ATTEMPT TO PROPITIATE IS NOT A PERSON AT ALL IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD
ALTHOUGH FLOATING LEGENDS GATHERED ROUND HER MEMORY AS THEY HAVE OFTEN GATHERED ROUND THE MEMORIES OF FAMOUS MEN LIKE SARGON OF AKKAD ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND THEODORIC THE GOTH WHO BECAME EMPEROR OF ROME IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE QUEEN WAS A PROMINENT HISTORICAL PERSONAGE

HE REGARDED HIMSELF AS THE EARTHLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RULER OF ALL--MERODACH THE LORD GOD OF RIGHT WHO CARRIED OUT THE DECREES OF ANU THE SKY GOD OF DESTINY
WE STILL CALL A HASTY PERSON A SPITFIRE AND A CALUMNIATOR A SPIT-POISON THE LIFE PRINCIPLE IN TREES C AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THE TEARS OF DEITIES

THE FOLLOWING ARE EXTRACTS FROM IT
THE RAIDERS WHO IN 1800 B.C
THREE MALE FIGURES PERHAPS ROYAL SONS ACCOMPANY THE PROMINENT CROWN PRINCE
THE CIVILIZATION OF WHICH HE WAS A PRODUCT HAD AN AGRICULTURAL BASIS
APPARENTLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR BY SENNACHERIB AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF BABYLON AND IT MAY BE THAT DURING HIS TERM OF OFFICE IN BABYLONIA HE WAS ATTRACTED BY ITS ETHICAL IDEALS AND DEVELOPED THOSE TRAITS OF CHARACTER WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER
TO THE REIGN OF ADAD-NIRARI BELONGS ALSO THAT IMPORTANT COMPILATION THE SYNCHRONISTIC HISTORY OF ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA WHICH DEALS WITH THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO KINGDOMS AND REFERS TO CONTEMPORARY EVENTS AND RULERS
SHE LINKS CLOSELY WITH ASTARTE AND ASHTORETH ISHTAR AND REFERENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE TO HER RELATIONS WITH ADONIS TAMMUZ THESE LOVE DEITIES WERE ALL AS CRUEL AS THEY WERE WAYWARD

IT WAS WIDELY PREVALENT THROUGHOUT BABYLONIA
INDEED DELUGE MYTHS WERE WIDESPREAD IN THE NEW WORLD THE AMERICAN BELIEF THAT THE FIRST BEINGS WHO WERE CREATED WERE UNABLE TO LIVE ON EARTH WAS SHARED BY THE BABYLONIANS
SO WAS THE LAST SMOULDERING EMBER OF ELAMITE POWER STAMPED OUT IN BABYLONIA
HE THEN INVADED ELAM AND RETURNED WITH RICH BOOTY
TIAMAT AND MERODACH ADVANCED TO COMBAT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
WHEN HE APPROACHED TYRE LULI THE KING FLED TO CYPRUS
AS THOU KNOWEST THE CITY OF SHURIPPAK IS SITUATED UPON THE BANK OF THE EUPHRATES

THE BEATING OF NIMROD RECALLS THE BEATING OF THE CORN SPIRIT OF THE AGRICULTURAL LEGEND UTILIZED BY BURNS IN HIS BALLAD OF JOHN BARLEYCORN WHICH GIVES A JOCULAR ACCOUNT OF WIDESPREAD ANCIENT CUSTOMS THAT ARE NOT YET QUITE EXTINCT EVEN IN SCOTLAND:[203 THEY LAID HIM DOWN UPON HIS BACK AND CUDGELLED HIM FULL SORE

WE MAY THINK LITTLE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS REGARDING WHICH AFTER ALL WE HAVE ONLY A SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE FOR WE HAVE YET DISCOVERED LITTLE MORE THAN THE FRAGMENTS OF THE SHELL WHICH HELD THE PEARL THE FADED PETALS THAT WERE ONCE A ROSE BUT WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THEY PROVIDED INSPIRATION FOR THE ARTISTS AND SCULPTORS WHOSE ACHIEVEMENTS COMPEL OUR WONDER AND ADMIRATION MOVED STATESMEN TO INAUGURATE AND ADMINISTER HUMANITARIAN LAWS AND EXALTED RIGHT ABOVE MIGHT

CERTAIN OF THE ARYAN TRIBES FOR INSTANCE BURIED THEIR DEAD IN VARUNA'S HOUSE OF CLAY WHILE A GROWING PROPORTION CREMATED THEIR DEAD AND WORSHIPPED AGNI THE FIRE GOD
DURING THAT PERIOD HOWEVER THE INFLUENCE WHICH IT EXERCISED OVER THE ASSYRIAN COURT WAS SO GREAT THAT IT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DOWNFALL OF THE ROYAL LINE OF THE SECOND EMPIRE
THE REFERENCES TO THE GODDESS ISHTAR AND SARGON'S EARLY LIFE AS A GARDENER SUGGEST THAT THE KING DESIRED TO BE REMEMBERED AS AN AGRICULTURAL PATRIARCH IF NOT OF DIVINE AT ANY RATE OF SEMI-DIVINE ORIGIN
WE SEEM TO TRACE IN THE SUBLIME VEDIC HYMNS ADDRESSED BY THE INDIAN ARYANS TO MITRA AND VARUNA THE IMPRESS OF BABYLONIAN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT

NO DOUBT LIKE THAT CITY IT HAD ITS ORIGIN AT AN EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE PERIOD
EXCAVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT AN UNDISTURBED ARTIFICIAL MOUND AT SAKJE-GEUZI HAVE REVEALED EVIDENCES OF A CONTINUOUS CULTURE WHICH BEGAN TO FLOURISH BEFORE 3000 B.C.[282 IN ONE OF THE LOWER LAYERS OCCURRED THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF NEOLITHIC YELLOW-PAINTED POTTERY WITH BLACK GEOMETRIC DESIGNS WHICH RESEMBLES OTHER SPECIMENS OF PAINTED FABRICS FOUND IN TURKESTAN BY THE PUMPELLY EXPEDITION

THE RISE OF BABYLON INAUGURATED A NEW ERA IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN ASIA
AND BEN-HADAD THE KING OF SYRIA ESCAPED ON A HORSE WITH THE HORSEMAN
FOR THOU KNOWEST THAT THERE IS NOT AMONG US ANY THAT CAN SKILL TO HEW TIMBER LIKE UNTO THE SIDONIANS

FOR A BRIEF PERIOD A GREAT CONQUEROR NAMED RIM-ANUM HAD ESTABLISHED AN EMPIRE WHICH EXTENDED FROM KISH TO LARSA BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING HIM
UNDER ADAD-SHUM-UTSUR WHO REIGNED FOR THIRTY YEARS BABYLONIA RECOVERED MUCH OF ITS ANCIENT SPLENDOUR

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE GILGAMESH EPIC IN ONE OF ITS FORMS CONCLUDED WHEN THE HERO REACHED THE ISLAND OF PIR-NAPISHTIM LIKE THE INDIAN YAMA WHO SEARCHED AND SPIED THE PATH FOR MANY THE INDIAN LAND OF THE PITRIS ANCESTORS OVER WHICH YAMA PRESIDED MAY BE COMPARED TO THE EGYPTIAN HEAVEN OF OSIRIS

WITHAL HE WAS A GREAT TRAVELLER A STRENUOUS POLITICIAN AND AN ABLE DIPLOMATIST
THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF 70,000 ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES
FOR A PERIOD THE DATING OF WHICH IS UNCERTAIN THE MITANNIANS WERE OVERLORDS OF PART OF ASSYRIA INCLUDING NINEVEH AND EVEN ASSHUR AS WELL AS THE DISTRICT CALLED MUSRI BY THE ASSYRIANS AND PART OF CAPPADOCIA
OTHER GODS WERE DEPICTED WITH HUMAN BODIES AND THE HEADS OF BIRDS SERPENTS AND CROCODILES THUS FORMING LINKS BETWEEN THE ARCHAIC DEMONIAC AND THE LATER ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITIES
BABYLON WOULD THEREFORE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF MERODACH FOR ABOUT TWO CENTURIES

THE STORY PROCEEDS THAT SEMIRAMIS EXERCISED SO GREAT AN INFLUENCE OVER THE IMPRESSIONABLE KING NINUS THAT SHE PERSUADED HIM TO PROCLAIM HER QUEEN OF ASSYRIA FOR FIVE DAYS
HE WAS WELCOMED IN BABYLON WHICH OPENED ITS GATES TO HIM AND HE HAD HIMSELF PROCLAIMED KING OF SUMER AND AKKAD
OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN THIS CONNECTION IS THE EVIDENCE AFFORDED BY PALESTINE AND EGYPT
MENUAS'S CAPITAL WAS THE CITY OF TURUSHPA OR DHUSPAS VAN WHICH WAS CALLED KHALDINAS[502 AFTER THE NATIONAL GOD
THE PHILISTINES CAME FROM CRETE AND IF THEIR DAGON WAS IMPORTED FROM THAT ISLAND HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME CONNECTION WITH POSEIDON WHOSE WORSHIP EXTENDED THROUGHOUT GREECE
SHE IS ACCOMPANIED BY VARIOUS DEMONS--THE GALLU-DEMON THE SLAYER C.--AND HOLDS A CONVERSATION WITH TAMMUZ WHICH HOWEVER IS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND BADLY BROKEN APPARENTLY HOWEVER HE PROMISES TO RETURN TO EARTH
THE MUSKI WERE FORERUNNERS OF THE PHRYGIANS AND WERE PROBABLY OF ALLIED STOCK
HE DIVIDED THE FLESH OF KU-PU[159 AND DEVISED A CUNNING PLAN
HIS RECORDS ARE SILENT IN THAT CONNECTION BUT JUDGING FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF HIM IT MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HE WAS ABLE AND FULLY PREPARED TO GIVE A GOOD ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF IN BATTLE
THROUGH THE DOOR LIKE A SNAKE THEY GLIDE THROUGH THE HINGE LIKE THE WIND THEY STORM TEARING THE WIFE FROM THE EMBRACE OF THE MAN DRIVING THE FREEDMAN FROM HIS FAMILY HOME.[97 THESE FURIES DID NOT CONFINE THEIR UNWELCOMED ATTENTIONS TO MANKIND ALONE
SHE WAS THE GREAT MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE SOURCE OF THE FOOD SUPPLY
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE TO FIND THAT BABYLONIA WAS THE CRADLE OF ASTRONOMY
ACCORDING TO THE COMMENTATORS OF THE KORAN NIMROD THE BABYLONIAN KING WHO CAST VICTIMS IN HIS ANNUAL BONFIRES AT CUTHAH DIED ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE TAMMUZ MONTH WHICH ACCORDING TO THE SYRIAN CALENDAR FELL ON 13TH JULY.[202 IT IS RELATED THAT GNATS ENTERED NIMROD'S BRAIN CAUSING THE MEMBRANE TO GROW LARGER
LET NOT THY GOD IN WHOM THOU TRUSTEST DECEIVE THEE SAYING JERUSALEM SHALL NOT BE GIVEN INTO THE HAND OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA

PROFESSOR BUDGE IS OF OPINION THAT BOTH THE SUMERIANS AND THE EARLY EGYPTIANS DERIVED THEIR PRIMEVAL GODS FROM SOME COMMON BUT EXCEEDINGLY ANCIENT SOURCE FOR HE FINDS IN THE BABYLONIAN AND NILE VALLEYS THAT THERE IS A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN TWO EARLY GROUPS WHICH SEEMS TO BE TOO CLOSE TO BE ACCIDENTAL".[47 THE EGYPTIAN GROUP COMPRISES FOUR PAIRS OF VAGUE GODS AND GODDESSES--NU AND HIS CONSORT NUT HEHU AND HIS CONSORT HEHUT KEKUI AND HIS CONSORT KEKUIT AND KERH AND HIS CONSORT KERHET

MUCH CONTROVERSY HAS BEEN WAGED REGARDING THE ORIGINAL HOME OF THE SUMERIANS AND THE PARTICULAR RACIAL TYPE WHICH THEY REPRESENTED
IT WAS ALSO THE FAVOURITE REMEDY FOR SKIN DISEASES NO DOUBT THE PRESENT INHABITANTS OF BABYLONIA WHO UTILIZE BITUMEN AS A GERMICIDE ARE PERPETUATING AN ANCIENT FOLK CUSTOM
IN ADDITION TO THE OUTPOURINGS OF ARABIAN PEOPLES INTO PALESTINE AND SYRIA WHICH PROPELLED OTHER TRIBES TO INVADE MESOPOTAMIA NORTHERN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA THERE WAS ALSO MUCH UNREST ALL OVER THE WIDE AREA TO NORTH AND WEST OF ELAM

ITS NATURAL RESOURCES GAVE IT GREAT RECUPERATIVE POWERS AND THE NATIVE POPULATION WAS EVER SO INTENSELY PATRIOTIC THAT CENTURIES OF ALIEN SWAY COULD NOT OBLITERATE THEIR NATIONAL ASPIRATIONS
IT WAS FROM ONE OF THESE ELAMITE MONARCHS THAT SIN-MUBALLIT CAPTURED ISIN AND PROBABLY THE ELAMITES WERE ALSO THE LEADERS OF THE ARMY OF UR WHICH HE HAD ROUTED BEFORE THAT EVENT TOOK PLACE

THE SAME MYTHS MAY HAVE BEEN ATTACHED TO CORN GODS AND CORN GODDESSES ASSOCIATED WITH WATER SUN MOON AND STARS
AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE CASE OF EA-OANNES AND THE DEITIES OF MENDES A FISH GOD MAY ALSO BE A CORN GOD A LAND ANIMAL GOD AND A GOD OF OCEAN AND THE SKY
HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES
AS HAS BEEN SHOWN CHAPTER III GODS WERE SUPPOSED TO DIE ANNUALLY
APPARENTLY EA HAD CONCEIVED IN HIS HEART THAT MANKIND SHOULD BE CREATED
HIS NAME WAS MATUN BUT HE WAS AFTERWARDS NICKNAMED EL-KHIDR THAT IS TO SAY GREEN WHAT EXPLANATION HE OFFERED FOR HIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF APPEARANCE HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED.[220 IT IS RELATED THAT WHEN MATUN REACHED THE WELL OF LIFE A DRIED FISH WHICH HE DIPPED IN THE WATER WAS RESTORED TO LIFE AND SWAM AWAY

THIS DEITY WAS SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED WITH MERODACH SON OF EA
ALL THE GODS REJOICED AND THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES AND CRIED OUT MERODACH IS KING THEREAFTER THEY GAVE HIM THE SCEPTRE AND THE THRONE AND THE INSIGNIA OF ROYALTY AND ALSO AN IRRESISTIBLE WEAPON[158 WITH WHICH TO OVERCOME HIS ENEMIES SAYING
THEY REFLECTED THE CHARACTERS OF THEIR MONTHS
IT IS AS AMURRU-RAMMAN THAT MERODACH BEARS COMPARISON WITH ZEUS
HE WAS THE WIND GOD WHO GAVE THE AIR OF LIFE
ABOUT 606 B.C
LORD THOU ART HOLY
HE ALSO CONDUCTED DIGGINGS AT BABYLON AND NIFFER NIPPUR HIS WORK WAS CONTINUED BY HIS ASSISTANT HORMUZD RASSAM A NATIVE CHRISTIAN OF MOSUL NEAR NINEVEH
HE HATH MADE IT DEEP AND LARGE
OTHER SONS RECEIVED IMPORTANT PRIESTLY APPOINTMENTS
IF THE VIEW IS ACCEPTED THAT ASHUR IS ANSHAR IT CAN BE URGED THAT HE WAS IMPORTED FROM SUMERIA
HIS SPIRIT INHABITED THE LUNAR STONE SO THAT MOON AND STONE WORSHIP WERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED
IN TIME THEY ENTERED A THICK FOREST AND WONDERED GREATLY AT THE NUMEROUS AND LOFTY CEDARS
IT IS BELIEVED TO MARK THE COURSE FOLLOWED IN THE EARLY SUMERIAN PERIOD BY THE EUPHRATES RIVER WHICH HAS MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD MANY MILES BEYOND THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES THAT WERE ERECTED ON ITS BANKS
BABYLON WELCOMED ITS NEW KING--A BABYLONIAN BY BIRTH AND THE SON OF A BABYLONIAN PRINCESS
HE SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE CAPITAL WITH A STRONG ARMY OVERAWED THE KASSITES AND SEIZED AND SLEW NAZIBUGASH
IN SAXO'S MYTHICAL HISTORY OF DENMARK FREY AS FRODE IS TAKEN PRISONER BY A STORM GIANT BELI THE HOWLER AND IS LOVED BY HIS HAG SISTER IN THE TEUTONIC HADES AS TAMMUZ IS LOVED BY ERESH-KI-GAL SPOUSE OF THE STORM GOD NERGAL IN THE BABYLONIAN HADES
INDEED IT MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE NORTHERN HILLMEN IN THE EARLY ASSYRIAN PERIOD THAT ASHUR WAS DEVELOPED AS A FATHER GOD--A BAAL
THE HYMN REFERRED TO LAUDS GARUDA AS THE BIRD OF LIFE THE PRESIDING SPIRIT OF THE ANIMATE AND INANIMATE UNIVERSE
THERE WAS NO HEAVEN FOR THE BABYLONIAN DEAD
162 THIS PORTION IS FRAGMENTARY AND SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THE BABYLONIANS HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THE SCIENCE OF ASTRONOMY
HE WAS A GOD OF DESTINY THE LORD OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD AND WAS EXALTED AS THE GREAT JUDGE THE LAWGIVER WHO UPHELD JUSTICE
WE HAVE THUS A SCHEME OF THIRTY-SIX CONSTELLATIONS
INDEED IT WAS NOT UNTIL CAVALRY WAS INCLUDED IN THE STANDING ARMY OF ASSYRIA THAT OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARAMAEANS WERE ATTENDED WITH PERMANENT SUCCESS

IN 715 B.C
WE CAN TRACE IN BABYLONIA AS IN EGYPT THE EARLY BELIEF THAT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE HAD A FEMALE ORIGIN

IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN EARLY FORM OF THE WIDESPREAD TAMMUZ MYTH IS THE TEUTONIC LEGEND REGARDING THE MYSTERIOUS CHILD WHO CAME OVER THE SEA TO INAUGURATE A NEW ERA OF CIVILIZATION AND INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE HOW TO GROW CORN AND BECOME GREAT WARRIORS

THE GROWTH OF THE FISH SUGGESTS THE GROWTH OF THE RIVER RISING IN FLOOD
IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE WERE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE TAMMUZ MYTH IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA
THE DIVINE NAME ASHIR AS IN EARLY ASSYRIAN TEXTS THE INSTITUTION OF EPONYMS AND MANY PERSONAL NAMES WHICH OCCUR IN ASSYRIA ARE SO CHARACTERISTIC THAT WE MUST ASSUME KINSHIP OF PEOPLES
SOME THINK THAT THE JEWS FAVOURED THE CAUSE OF CYRUS
THE NORTHERN MONARCH HAD ENGAGED HIMSELF IN SUBDUING THE LULLUME AND AKHLAMI HILL TRIBES IN THE SOUTH-EAST WHOSE TERRITORY HAD BEEN CONQUERED BY NEBUCHADREZZAR
THE FINES IMPOSED FOR A GIVEN OFFENCE UPON WEALTHY MEN WERE MUCH HEAVIER THAN THOSE IMPOSED UPON THE POOR

WHEN AN ANIMAL TOTEM WAS SACRIFICED ONCE A YEAR AND EATEN SACRIFICIALLY SO THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE CLAN MIGHT BE MAINTAINED THE PRIEST WHO WRAPPED HIMSELF IN ITS SKIN WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE TRANSMITTED TO HIM CERTAIN MAGICAL POWERS

THE IDEA THAT IT REPRESENTS THE SUN IN ECLIPSE WITH PROTRUDING RAYS SEEMS RATHER FAR-FETCHED BECAUSE ECLIPSES WERE DISASTERS AND INDICATIONS OF DIVINE WRATH;[385 IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY THE RAYS SHOULD ONLY STRETCH OUT SIDEWAYS LIKE WINGS AND DOWNWARD LIKE A TAIL WHY THE RAYS SHOULD BE DOUBLE LIKE THE DOUBLE WINGS OF CHERUBS BULLS C AND DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS SUGGESTING FEATHERS OR WHY THE DISK IS SURMOUNTED BY CONVENTIONALIZED HORNS TIPPED WITH STAR-LIKE RING SYMBOLS IDENTICAL WITH THOSE DEPICTED IN THE HOLY TREE

EVERY TIME WE LOOK AT OUR WATCHES WE ARE REMINDED OF THE ANCIENT MATHEMATICIANS WHO COUNTED ON THEIR FINGERS AND MULTIPLIED 10 BY 6 TO GIVE US MINUTES AND SECONDS AND DIVIDED THE DAY AND THE NIGHT INTO TWELVE HOURS BY MULTIPLYING SIX BY THE TWO LEADEN FEET OF TIME
GERMS OF DISEASE WERE DEPICTED BY LIVELY IMAGINATIONS AS INVISIBLE DEMONS WHO DERIVED NOURISHMENT FROM THE HUMAN BODY

ISHTAR AS QUEEN OF HEAVEN WAS ALSO ADORED BY THE BACKSLIDING ISRAELITES AS A DEITY OF BATTLE AND HARVEST
AS EMISSARIES OF FATE THEY COULD INJURE THE LIVING
HE FOUNDED A NEW HOUSE OF ASHUR AT NINEVEH AND RECONSTRUCTED SEVERAL TEMPLES IN BABYLONIA
AS WE HAVE SEEN HE COMBINED FORCES WITH HIS DISTINGUISHED AND POWERFUL KINSMAN AND LAID A HEAVY HAND ON THE SUTI THEN HE DUG WELLS AND ERECTED A CHAIN OF FORTIFICATIONS LIKE BLOCK-HOUSES SO THAT CARAVANS MIGHT COME AND GO WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND MERCHANTS BE FREED FROM THE IMPOSTS OF PETTY KINGS WHOSE TERRITORY THEY HAD TO PENETRATE WHEN TRAVELLING BY THE HARAN ROUTE

THE TEMPLE IN WHICH HIS INTERESTS WERE CENTRED WAS ERECTED IN HONOUR OF NIN-GIRSU

ACCORDING TO BABYLONIAN BELIEF THE GREAT STORMS DIRECTED FROM HEAVEN WERE CAUSED BY DEMONS

WHATEVER THE EXPLANATION MAY BE OF ONE ANIMAL DEITY OF FERTILITY SLAYING ANOTHER IT SEEMS CERTAIN THAT THE CONFLICT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDEA OF SACRIFICE TO PROCURE THE FOOD SUPPLY

HE APPEARS TO HAVE OVERRUN AKKAD AND EVEN PENETRATED TO THE SYRIAN COAST FOR IN ONE INSCRIPTION IT IS STATED THAT HE MADE STRAIGHT HIS PATH FROM THE LOWER SEA THE PERSIAN GULF OVER THE EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS TO THE UPPER SEA THE MEDITERRANEAN THE ALLEGIANCE OF CERTAIN STATES HOWEVER DEPENDED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE CENTRAL POWER
AS SHALMANESER WAS THE FIRST ASSYRIAN KING WHO CAME INTO DIRECT TOUCH WITH THE HEBREWS IT WILL BE OF INTEREST HERE TO REVIEW THE HISTORY OF THE DIVIDED KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH AS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT IT THROWS ON INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND THE SITUATION WHICH CONFRONTED SHALMANESER IN MESOPOTAMIA AND SYRIA IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS REIGN

POSSIBLY IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE DEAD MIGHT ALSO HAVE VISIONS IN THEIR DREAMS WHICH WOULD REVEAL THE PURPOSE OF DEMONS WHO WERE PREPARING TO ATTACK THEM
THE CEREMONY OF BURNING SAUL IS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
THESE SHE ARMED WITH FIERCE WEAPONS AND THEY HAD NO FEAR OF WAR
TIGLATH-PILESER BURNED THE ROYAL TENT AND THRONE AS AN OFFERING TO ASHUR AND CARRIED SHARDURIS'S BED TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS OF NINEVEH WHITHER HE RETURNED TO PREPARE A NEW PLAN OF CAMPAIGN AGAINST HIS NORTHERN RIVAL
IN EZEKIEL'S COMPARISON OF ASSYRIA TO A MIGHTY TREE THERE IS NO DOUBT A MYTHOLOGICAL REFERENCE

THE BABYLONIAN NOBLES MEANTIME DROVE THE ASSYRIAN GARRISONS FROM THEIR CITIES AND SET ON THE THRONE THE KASSITE PRINCE ADAD-SHUM-UTSUR
THE MYTH REGARDING THE FATHER WHO WAS SUPERSEDED BY HIS SON MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTENCE IN BABYLONIAN CITY PANTHEONS OF ELDER AND YOUNGER GODS WHO SYMBOLIZED THE PASSIVE AND ACTIVE FORCES OF NATURE
IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH AMENHOTEP III TUSHRATTA TELLS THAT HIS KINGDOM HAD BEEN INVADED BY THE HITTITES BUT HIS GOD TESHUP HAD DELIVERED THEM INTO HIS HAND AND HE DESTROYED THEM
A MALE WATER MONSTER PREYS NIGHTLY UPON THE WARRIORS WHO SLEEP IN THE GREAT HALL OF KING HROTHGAR
IT IS A WAILFUL WOMAN SEEKING HER LOST CHILD
IN ANOTHER LETTER TUSHRATTA ASKED FOR A LARGE QUANTITY OF GOLD WITHOUT MEASURE HE COMPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND HINTED THAT SOME OF THE EGYPTIAN GOLD LOOKED AS IF IT WERE ALLOYED WITH COPPER
IT CAN SCARCELY BE SUPPOSED THAT THESE INVASIONS OF SETTLED DISTRICTS DID NOT RESULT IN THE FUSION AND CROSSMENT OF RACIAL TYPES AND THE PRODUCTION OF A SUB-VARIETY WITH MEDIUM SKULL FORM AND MARKED FACIAL CHARACTERISTICS

IT FORMS SAYS PROFESSOR PINCHES A GOOD SUBJECT FOR COMPARISON WITH THE BABYLONIAN ACCOUNT WITH WHICH IT AGREES SO CLOSELY IN ALL THE MAIN POINTS AND FROM WHICH IT DIFFERS SO MUCH IN MANY ESSENTIAL DETAILS."[233 THE DRIFT OF BABYLONIAN CULTURE WAS NOT ONLY DIRECTED WESTWARD TOWARDS THE COAST OF PALESTINE AND FROM THENCE TO GREECE DURING THE PHOENICIAN PERIOD BUT ALSO EASTWARD THROUGH ELAM TO THE IRANIAN PLATEAU AND INDIA

WILD ANIMALS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER FORMS OF HUMAN BEINGS WHO COULD MARRY PRINCES AND PRINCESSES AS THEY DO IN SO MANY FAIRY TALES

THE CITY OF BABYLON HAD GROWN RICH AND POWERFUL AS THE COMMERCIAL METROPOLIS OF WESTERN ASIA
WHEN THE ASSYRIANS WERE ENTERING THE CITY GATES A SENSATIONAL HAPPENING OCCURRED
AND SOLOMON SENT TO HIRAM SAYING THOU KNOWEST HOW THAT DAVID MY FATHER COULD NOT BUILD AN HOUSE UNTO THE NAME OF THE LORD HIS GOD FOR THE WARS WHICH WERE ABOUT HIM ON EVERY SIDE UNTIL THE LORD PUT THEM UNDER THE SOLES OF HIS FEET
THE STRUGGLES WAGED BETWEEN THE GREAT POWERS FOR THE CONTROL OF TRADE ROUTES AND THE PERIODIC MIGRATIONS OF PASTORAL WARRIOR FOLKS WHO DETERMINED THE FATE OF EMPIRES ARE ALSO DEALT WITH SO THAT LIGHT MAY BE THROWN ON THE VARIOUS PROCESSES AND INFLUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS OF LOCAL RELIGIONS AND MYTHOLOGIES
THIS CLASSIFICATION SUGGESTS THAT NIPPUR HAD EITHER RISEN IN POLITICAL IMPORTANCE AND DOMINATED THE CITIES OF ERECH AND ERIDU OR THAT ITS PRIESTS WERE INFLUENTIAL AT THE COURT OF A RULER WHO WAS THE OVERLORD OF SEVERAL CITY STATES
THE STUDY OF THE HEAVENS FORMED PART OF THE WISDOM WHICH IS TRACED BACK TO NEBO AND THE TEMPLE SCHOOL AT BORSIPPA BECAME ONE OF THE CHIEF CENTRES FOR THE ASTROLOGICAL AND SUBSEQUENTLY FOR THE ASTRONOMICAL LORE OF BABYLONIA

THEIR HOUSES SHALL BE FULL OF DOLEFUL CREATURES
THE FLOATING LEGENDS WITH WHICH THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WERE UTILIZED AND DEVELOPED BY THE PRIESTS WHEN ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF SYSTEMATIZING AND SYMBOLIZING RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WITH PURPOSE TO UNFOLD THE SECRETS OF CREATION AND THE OTHERWORLD

EGYPTIAN POWER HAD BEEN LONG EXTINGUISHED IN THAT REGION
IN THE FERTILE AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS AND ROUND THE SHORES OF THAT GREAT EUR-ASIAN LAND BRIDGE THE INDIGENOUS STOCK WAS ALSO OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE AS SERGI AND OTHER ETHNOLOGISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED

IN THE EVENING AFTER THE LABOUR OF THE DAY I OFTEN SAT AT THE DOOR OF MY TENT GIVING MYSELF UP TO THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF THAT CALM AND REPOSE WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO THE SENSES BY SUCH SCENES AS THESE
AMONG THE PEOPLES WHO OBSERVED MALE RIGHT SOCIAL LIFE WAS REFLECTED IN THE CONCEPTION OF CONTROLLING MALE DEITIES ACCOMPANIED BY SHADOWY GODDESSES WHO WERE OFTEN LITTLE ELSE THAN FIGURES OF SPEECH
IF SHE BECAME A WIDOW FOR INSTANCE SHE COULD NOT REMARRY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A JUDGE TO WHOM SHE WAS EXPECTED TO SHOW GOOD CAUSE FOR THE STEP SHE PROPOSED TO TAKE
THE SEMITIC AKKADIANS THEREFORE ADOPTED SUMERIAN HABITS OF LIFE WHICH WERE BEST SUITED FOR THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY AND THEY CONSEQUENTLY CAME UNDER THE SPELL OF SUMERIAN MODES OF THOUGHT
HE MARRIED A BABYLONIAN PRINCESS AND ONE OF HIS SONS SHAMASH-SHUM-UKIN WAS BORN IN A BABYLONIAN PALACE PROBABLY AT SIPPAR
MERODACH THE DRAGON SLAYER VIII
JEHU'S RELIGIOUS REVOLT IN ISRAEL WHICH ESTABLISHED ONCE AGAIN THE CULT OF ASHTORETH OCCURRED AFTER HE CAME UNDER THE SWAY OF DAMASCUS AND MAY HAVE NOT BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE POLITICAL ASCENDANCY ELSEWHERE OF THE GODDESS CULT
309
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE INFLUENCE OF BABYLON MUST HAVE BEEN STRONGLY FELT IN THIS CONNECTION
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DEITIES WAS DUE TO THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT TO WHICH THEY WERE SUBJECTED IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS
THEY LIVE
HOW IS SHE BECOME AS A WIDOW
THEN HE TOOK STEPS TO STAMP OUT THE EMBERS OF REVOLT IN UMMA BY APPOINTING AS ITS GOVERNOR ONE OF HIS OWN OFFICIALS NAMED ILI WHO WAS DULY INSTALLED WITH GREAT CEREMONY
SAMARIA CLOSED ITS GATES AGAINST HIM ALTHOUGH THEIR KING HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO ASSYRIA
A DESPERATE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT
BUT HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN UNDISPUTED POSSESSION
THE BABYLONIAN SATURN AS WE HAVE SEEN IS BLACK AND ITS GOD NINIP WAS THE DESTROYING BOAR WHICH RECALLS THE BLACK BOAR OF THE EGYPTIAN DEMON OR ELDER GOD SET
BUT PROMINENCE WAS ALSO GIVEN TO THE MOON GOD NANNAR TO WHOM A TEMPLE HAD BEEN ERECTED A FACT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SUN WORSHIP WAS NOT MORE PRONOUNCED AMONG THE SEMITES THAN THE ARABIANS AND MAY NOT INDEED HAVE BEEN OF SEMITIC ORIGIN AT ALL
IN THEIR DOCTRINE OF THE WORLD'S AGES OR YUGAS FOR INSTANCE WE ARE FORCIBLY REMINDED OF THE EUPHRATEAN IDEAS REGARDING SPACE AND TIME

ALL INDICATIONS OF SOCIAL UNREST WERE IT WOULD APPEAR SEVERELY REPRESSED BY THE IRON-GLOVED MONARCHS OF UR-NINA'S DYNASTY

PRINCES AND OTHER SUBJECT RULERS WHO GOVERNED UNDER AN OVERLORD MIGHT BE AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WERE REFERRED TO AS KINGS
ULTIMATELY THE PEOPLE PRAYED TO THE GODDESS ARURU TO CREATE A LIBERATOR
A GOD OF FERTILITY IS A CORN GOD AND A WATER GOD
THANKS TO THEIR HELP THE EMPIRE WAS CONSOLIDATED AND MAINTAINED WITHOUT TOO MANY VIOLENT OUTBREAKS IN REGIONS FAR REMOVED FROM THE CAPITAL AND BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE REACH OF THE SOVEREIGN."[525 WHILE SARGON WAS ABSENT IN THE WEST A REVOLT BROKE OUT IN BABYLONIA
THERE THEY APPEAR TO HAVE PROSPERED
OTHER DEITIES WHO WERE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF NIN-GIRSU AND NINA HAD BEEN GIVEN RECOGNITION BY HIS PREDECESSORS AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ORTHODOX SECTION OF LAGASH AND ESPECIALLY THE AGRICULTURAL CLASSES SUPPORTED THE NEW RULER IN SWEEPING AWAY INNOVATIONS TO WHICH THEY WERE HOSTILE
A CHALDAEAN KING MERODACH BALADAN III HAD ALLIED HIMSELF WITH THE ELAMITES AND OCCUPIED BABYLON

SEVERAL CENTURIES BEFORE THE DAYS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT HE SAYS THE GREEKS HAD BEGUN TO CULTIVATE THE STUDY OF THE HEAVENS NOT FOR PURPOSES OF DIVINATION BUT PROMPTED BY A SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT AS AN INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO SOLVE THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER TO OVERRATE THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT OF THE GREEKS WHO LIKE THE JAPANESE IN OUR OWN DAY WERE ACCOMPLISHED BORROWERS FROM OTHER CIVILIZATIONS

NARAM-SIN INHERITED THE EMPIRE OF SARGON OF AKKAD WHICH EXTENDED TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
HE STOOD BEFORE ANSHAR WHO KISSED HIM BECAUSE THAT HE BANISHED FEAR
THE CEDARS IN THE GARDEN OF GOD COULD NOT HIDE HIM
THESE LATE COMERS HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN INFLUENCED BY BABYLONIAN IDEAS BEFORE THEY ENTERED INDIA
THE ELAMITES WERE FORCED TO RETREAT AND FOLLOWING UP THEIR MAIN FORCE HE INFLICTED UPON THEM A SHATTERING DEFEAT ON THE BANKS OF THE ULA A TRIBUTARY OF THE TIGRIS
IN INDIA SAP WAS CALLED THE BLOOD OF TREES AND REFERENCES TO BLEEDING TREES ARE STILL WIDESPREAD AND COMMON
THE GUILTY PARTIES WERE BOUND TOGETHER AND THROWN INTO THE RIVER
IT HAD BEEN TOO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED DURING THE HAMMURABI AGE WHICH WAS THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA AS THE HEARTLIKE DISTRIBUTOR AND CONTROLLER OF BUSINESS LIFE THROUGH A VAST NETWORK OF VEINS AND ARTERIES TO BE DISPLACED BY ANY OTHER MESOPOTAMIAN CITY TO PLEASURE EVEN A MIGHTY MONARCH
TROLLS SHALL TORMENT THEE FROM MORN TILL EVE IN THE REALMS OF THE JOTUN RACE EACH DAY TO THE DWELLINGS OF FROST GIANTS MUST THOU CREEP HELPLESS CREEP HOPELESS OF LOVE
WHEREFORE THE LORD BROUGHT UPON THEM THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH THE CAPTAINS OF THE HOST OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA WHICH TOOK MANASSEH AMONG THE THORNS AND BOUND HIM WITH FETTERS AND CARRIED HIM TO BABYLON
HE RECORDED
SO HE PLOTTED WITH REZIN KING OF DAMASCUS

AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES IN 854 B.C SHALMANESER III OF ASSYRIA FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INVADE BABYLONIA
WHEN SYRIA WAS SUSTAINING THE FIRST SHOCKS OF ARAMAEAN INVASION THE LAST WAVE OF ACHAEANS THE TAMERS OF HORSES AND SHEPHERDS OF THE PEOPLE HAD ACHIEVED THE CONQUEST OF GREECE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERTHROW OF THE DYNASTY OF KING MINOS OF CRETE
HIS SUFFERINGS MAKE ME SAD
THEIR ANCIENT CAPITAL WAS AT BOGHAZ-KOEI THE SITE OF PTERIA WHICH WAS DESTROYED ACCORDING TO THE GREEKS BY CROESUS THE LAST KING OF LYDIA IN THE SIXTH CENTURY B.C
BUT AS THE IDEOGRAM FOR MOUNTAIN AND LAND WAS USED IN THE EARLIEST TIMES AS KING SHOWS WITH REFERENCE TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES,[46 IT IS MORE PROBABLE THAT ENLIL WAS EXALTED AS A WORLD GOD WHO HAD DOMINION OVER NOT ONLY SUMER AND AKKAD BUT ALSO THE TERRITORIES OCCUPIED BY THE RIVALS AND ENEMIES OF THE EARLY BABYLONIANS
THIS GOD WHO IS IDENTICAL WITH SUTEKH A SYRIAN AND ASIA MINOR DEITY WAS APPARENTLY WORSHIPPED BY A TRIBE WHICH WAS OVERCOME IN THE COURSE OF EARLY TRIBAL STRUGGLES IN PRE-DYNASTIC TIMES
A LATER KING CREDITED HIM WITH HAVING PENETRATED TO THE PHOENICIAN COAST WHERE HE PUT TO SEA AND SLEW A SEA MONSTER CALLED THE NAKHIRU WHILE AT ARVAD THE NARRATIVE CONTINUES THE KING OF EGYPT WHO IS NOT NAMED SENT HIM A HIPPOPOTAMUS PAGUTU THIS STORY HOWEVER IS OF DOUBTFUL AUTHENTICITY
MAN AND WOMAN AND CHILD GROW UP AND ARRIVE AT MATURITY AND BECOME OLD AND WHEN ANY ONE OF THEM DIETH WE BURY HIM IN THE PLACE WHEREIN HE LIVED
THE CITY WAS NOT CAPTURED BUT MUCH OF ITS TERRITORY WAS CEDED TO THE KING OF SIDON
THIS TERRITORY HE WROTE IS OF ALL THAT WE KNOW THE BEST BY FAR FOR PRODUCING GRAIN
HE WHO TAKES NO BRIBE WHO CARES FOR THE OPPRESSED IS FAVOURED BY SHAMASH,--HIS LIFE SHALL BE PROLONGED.[74 THE WORSHIPPERS OF VARUNA AND MITRA IN THE PUNJAB DID NOT CREMATE THEIR DEAD LIKE THOSE WHO EXALTED THE RIVAL FIRE GOD AGNI

A SOLDIER ENTERED THE CAMP OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA AND KILLED HIM MONTH AB DAY 12TH SENNACHERIB SAT ON THE THRONE).[530 THE FACT THAT SENNACHERIB LAMENTED HIS FATHER'S SINS SUGGESTS THAT THE OLD KING HAD IN SOME MANNER OFFENDED THE PRIESTHOOD

THE ENEMIES OF EGYPT IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA WERE THE HITTITES AND MITANNIANS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THESE WERE ALSO THE ENEMIES OF ASSYRIA

HE WAS THE PATRIARCH WHO REIGNED OVER MEN AND BECAME THE JUDGE OF THE DEAD
HE SURPRISED THE INVADERS AMONG THE KASHIARI MOUNTAINS AND INFLICTED A CRUSHING DEFEAT SLAYING ABOUT 14,000 AND CAPTURING 6000 PRISONERS WHO WERE TRANSPORTED TO ASSHUR

GODS AND MEN BEFORE THE FACE OF THE GODS ARE WEEPING FOR THEE AT THE SAME TIME WHEN THEY BEHOLD ME

TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI KING OF BIT-ADINI IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES

IN BABYLONIA THE AGRICULTURAL MYTH REGARDING THE MOTHER GODDESS AND THE YOUNG GOD HAD MANY VARIATIONS
THE CAKES INTENDED FOR A GODDESS WERE NOT OFFERED UP IN THE TEMPLE OF ABRAHAM'S GOD BUT IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM AND THOSE OF OTHER CITIES.[143 THE OBVIOUS DEDUCTION SEEMS TO BE THAT IN ANCIENT TIMES WOMEN EVERYWHERE PLAYED A PROMINENT PART IN THE CEREMONIAL FOLK WORSHIP OF THE GREAT MOTHER GODDESS WHILE THE MEN TOOK THE LESSER PART OF THE GOD WHOM SHE HAD BROUGHT INTO BEING AND AFTERWARDS RECEIVED AS HUSBAND OF HIS MOTHER THIS MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH SOCIAL STATUS OF WOMEN AMONG GODDESS WORSHIPPERS LIKE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE WHOSE EARLY RELIGION WAS NOT CONFINED TO TEMPLES BUT CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTS OF EVERYDAY LIFE

AS THIS DEITY COMES EACH YEAR IN WESTERN ASIA WHEN VEGETATION HAS WITHERED AND AFTER FRUITS HAVE DROPPED FROM TREES BRINGING TEMPESTS AND BLACK RAINCLOUDS TO ISSUE IN A NEW SEASON OF GROWTH AND FRESH ACTIVITY SO HE DESCENDED FROM THE HILLS IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA AS THE BATTLE LORD OF INVADERS AND THE STORMY HERALD OF A NEW AGE WHICH WAS TO DAWN UPON THE ANCIENT WORLD
IT WAS PROBABLY A CENTRE OF DISCONTENT DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF KASSITE ASCENDANCY

INDEED IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TRADITIONS REGARDING HER CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEMIRAMIS LEGENDS

THE INFLUENCE OF BABYLONIA IS APPARENT IN THESE CALCULATIONS
IT IS BELIEVED THAT THESE MIGRATIONS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGING CLIMATIC CONDITIONS A PROLONGED DRY CYCLE HAVING CAUSED A SHORTAGE OF HERBAGE WITH THE RESULT THAT PASTORAL PEOPLES WERE COMPELLED TO GO FARTHER AND FARTHER AFIELD IN QUEST OF FRESH WOODS AND PASTURES NEW INNUMERABLE CURRENTS AND CROSS CURRENTS WERE SET IN MOTION ONCE THESE RACE MOVEMENTS SWEPT TOWARDS SETTLED DISTRICTS EITHER TO FLOOD THEM WITH HUMAN WAVES OR SURROUND THEM LIKE ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF TEMPEST-LASHED SEAS FRETTING THE FRONTIERS WITH RESTLESS FURY AND EVER GROPING FOR AN INLET THROUGH WHICH TO FLOW WITH IRRESISTIBLE FORCE

A TREATY OF PEACE WAS AFTERWARDS ARRANGED WHICH SECURED FOR THE ASSYRIANS A FURTHER EXTENSION OF THEIR FRONTIER FROM THE BORDERS OF MITANNI AS FAR AS BABYLONIA THE STRUGGLE OF THE FUTURE WAS TO BE FOR THE POSSESSION OF MESOPOTAMIA SO AS TO SECURE CONTROL OVER THE TRADE ROUTES

I WILL FIGHT WITH THEE THE BABYLONIAN MONARCH ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE INVADED THE TERRITORY OF HIS RIVAL AND WON A GREAT VICTORY

HE WAS PROUD OF HIS MILITARY ACHIEVEMENTS BUT PREFERRED TO BE REMEMBERED AS A SERVANT OF THE GODS A JUST RULER A FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE SHEPHERD THAT GIVES PEACE IN THE EPILOGUE TO HIS CODE OF LAWS HE REFERS TO THE BURDEN OF ROYALTY AND DECLARES THAT HE CUT OFF THE ENEMY AND LORDED IT OVER THE CONQUERED SO THAT HIS SUBJECTS MIGHT HAVE SECURITY

AFTERWARDS HE CAUSED ARAD EA TO CARRY GILGAMESH TO A FOUNTAIN OF HEALING WHERE HIS DISEASE-STRICKEN BODY WAS CLEANSED
ALL THESE ARE DEITIES OF TEMPEST AND THE MOUNTAINS--WILD HUNTSMEN IN THE RAGING HOST
WHEN THE CHERUBS RAN AND RETURNED THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THE NOISE OF THEIR WINGS RESEMBLED THE NOISE OF GREAT WATERS THEIR BODIES WERE LIKE BURNING COALS OF FIRE FERTILITY GODS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE LIGHTNING AND WATER

INDEED HE WAS IN THE END COMPELLED TO RETREAT WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS OWING TO THE DIFFICULT CHARACTER OF THAT MARSHY COUNTRY
LIKE THE NUBIANS AND THE LIBYANS WHO KEPT WATCHFUL EYES ON EGYPT THE ELAMITES SEEMED EVER TO BE HOVERING ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER OF SUMERIA LONGING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAID AND PLUNDER
THERE IS REALLY NO DIRECT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE THEORY THAT THE ASSYRIAN WINGED DISK OR DISK WITH PROTRUDING RAYS WAS OF MORE SPIRITUAL CHARACTER THAN THE WHEEL WHICH ENCLOSES THE FEATHER-ROBED ARCHER WITH HIS TRIDENT-SHAPED ARROW
THEN HE STOOD BETWEEN US AND GAVE HIS BLESSING
OSIRIS WHO RESEMBLED TAMMUZ A GOD OF MANY FORMS ALSO WAS ADDRESSED AS FOLLOWS IN ONE OF THE ISIS CHANTS

AMPHITRITE WAS HIS SPOUSE
SARGON OF AKKAD FLOURISHED ABOUT 2650 B.C AND HAMMURABI NOT LONG BEFORE OR AFTER 2000 B.C
THESE CIVILIZATIONS OF THE OLD WORLD AMONG WHICH THE MESOPOTAMIAN AND THE NILOTIC WERE THE EARLIEST WERE BUILT ON NO UNSOUND FOUNDATIONS

MANY OF THESE ALIENS CAME FROM DISTRICTS WHERE MOTHER WORSHIP PREVAILED AND HAD NO TRADITIONAL RESPECT FOR ASHUR WHILE THEY REGARDED WITH HOSTILITY THE MILITARY ARISTOCRACY WHO CONQUERED AND RULED IN THE NAME OF THAT DREADED DEITY

THEREAFTER HE CAPTURED SEVERAL CITIES AND EXTENDED HIS EMPIRE BEYOND THE KASHIARI HILLS AND INTO THE HEART OF MITANNI
A HUNTER WAS SENT OUT FROM ERECH TO SEARCH FOR THE MAN-MONSTER AND FOUND HIM BESIDE A STREAM IN A SAVAGE PLACE DRINKING WITH HIS ASSOCIATES THE WILD ANIMALS
WHEN THIS BEING DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE ALLATU
LIKE THE PROTO-EGYPTIANS THE EARLY CRETANS AND THE PELASGIANS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE AND ASIA MINOR THEY INVARIABLY ACHIEVED THE INTELLECTUAL CONQUEST OF THEIR CONQUERORS AS IN THE EARLIEST TIMES THEY HAD WON VICTORIES OVER THE ANTAGONISTIC FORCES OF NATURE

AMONG OTHER CITIES WHICH HAD TO BE CHASTISED WAS ANCIENT AKKAD WHERE A RIVAL MONARCH ENDEAVOURED TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF
TAMMUZ LIKE OSIRIS OF EGYPT WAS AN AGRICULTURAL DEITY AND AS THE BABYLONIAN HARVEST WAS THE GIFT OF THE RIVERS IT IS PROBABLE THAT ONE OF HIS SEVERAL FORMS WAS DUMU-ZI-ABZU TAMMUZ OF THE ABYSS HE WAS ALSO THE CHILD THE HEROIC LORD THE SENTINEL THE HEALER AND THE PATRIARCH WHO REIGNED OVER THE EARLY BABYLONIANS FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD
APPARENTLY HE WAS INFLUENCED BY LOCAL PRACTICES AND BELIEFS FOR HE MET AND MINGLED IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES WITH THE MEN OF THE LATE PALAEOLITHIC AGE

UR AND ERECH WERE BESIEGED AND CAPTURED BY THE CHALDAEANS AND AN ELAMITE ARMY MARCHED TO THE AID OF THE KING OF BABYLON BUT IT WAS WITHDRAWN BEFORE LONG ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNSETTLED POLITICAL CONDITIONS AT HOME
THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CAMPAIGN IS AS FOLLOWS
IF SHE MARRIED AS SHE MIGHT DO TO OBTAIN THE LEGAL STATUS OF A MARRIED WOMAN AND ENJOY THE PRIVILEGES OF THAT POSITION SHE DENIED HER HUSBAND CONJUGAL RITES BUT PROVIDED HIM WITH A CONCUBINE WHO MIGHT BEAR HIM CHILDREN AS SARAH DID TO ABRAHAM

THE HISTORIES ARE TRACED IN OUTLINE OF THE KINGDOMS OF ELAM URARTU ANCIENT ARMENIA MITANNI AND THE HITTITES WHILE THE STORY OF THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE HEBREW CIVILIZATION AS NARRATED IN THE BIBLE AND REFERRED TO IN MESOPOTAMIAN INSCRIPTIONS IS RELATED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES UNTIL THE CAPTIVITY IN THE NEO-BABYLONIAN PERIOD AND THE RESTORATION DURING THE AGE OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE

LIKE AMMIDITANA THESE TWO MONARCHS SET UP IMAGES OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS OF THE GODS SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE WORSHIPPED NO DOUBT
HIS ALLIES PROTECTED HIS FRONTIERS AND HE WAS ABLE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE WORK OF CONSOLIDATING HIS EMPIRE IN ASIA MINOR AND NORTH SYRIA

THE STARS WERE ALSO THE GHOSTS OF DEITIES WHO DIED DAILY
ISHTAR'S INNOCENCE IS EMPHASIZED BY THE FACT THAT SHE MOURNED FOR HER YOUTHFUL LOVER CRYING
MY HEART HATH FLED ME LIKE A BIRD ON WINGS AND LIKE THE DOVE I MOAN
COMMAND THE WINDING COURSE OF THE EUPHRATES AND THE WILL OF MERODACH SHALL ARREST THE FLOODS
HIS LEGAL CODES WERE NO DOUBT WRITTEN IN BLOOD AND HIS INSTITUTIONS WELDED IN THE FIRES OF ADVERSITY
HE DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A POLITICAL AGENT AND DIPLOMATIST

IN INDIAN MYTHOLOGY INDRA WAS SIMILARLY FOLLOWED BY THE STORMY MARUTS AND FIERCE RUDRA BY THE TEMPESTUOUS RUDRAS
THE STORM GOD AT ONCE HASTENED TO THE UNDERWORLD ACCOMPANIED BY HIS OWN GROUP OF FIERCE DEMONS WHOM HE PLACED AS GUARDIANS AT THE VARIOUS DOORS SO AS TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF ERESH-KI-GAL
THESE CALCULATIONS DO NOT COINCIDE IT WILL BE NOTED WITH THE STATEMENT IN A BABYLONIAN HYMN THAT MERODACH REMAINED IN THE LAND OF THE HATTI FOR TWENTY-FOUR YEARS WHICH HOWEVER MAY BE EITHER A PRIESTLY FICTION OR A REFERENCE TO A LATER CONQUEST
CERTAIN BELIEFS AND THE MYTHS WHICH WERE BASED UPON THEM ARE OLDER THAN EVEN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE TIGRO-EUPHRATES VALLEY

BUT NOW THE LORD MY GOD HATH GIVEN ME REST ON EVERY SIDE SO THAT THERE IS NEITHER ADVERSARY NOR EVIL OCCURRENT
THE SET PIG OF EGYPT AND THE DEVIL PIG OF IRELAND SCOTLAND AND WALES WERE NOT EATEN EXCEPT SACRIFICIALLY
I AM WEARY OF MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF HETH
AND HOSHEA BECAME HIS SERVANT AND GAVE HIM PRESENTS

TOWARDS THE NORTH AND NORTH-WEST HE ADDED A CONSIDERABLE AREA TO HIS KINGDOM WHICH BECAME AS LARGE AS ASSYRIA
A KING WHO REIGNED OVER BABYLON WITHOUT THE PRIESTLY PARTY ON HIS SIDE OCCUPIED AN INSECURE POSITION
THE ANCIENT SUMERIAN CITY OF UR WHICH DOMINATED A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF STEPPE LAND TO THE WEST OF THE EUPHRATES WAS INCLUDED IN THE SEALAND KINGDOM AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY REFERRED TO IN AFTER-TIME AS UR OF THE CHALDEES WHEN SOLOMON REIGNED OVER JUDAH AND ISRAEL BABYLONIA WAS BROKEN UP INTO A NUMBER OF PETTY STATES AS IN EARLY SUMERIAN TIMES
IN MANY COUNTRIES THE DOVE IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH LOVE AND ALSO SYMBOLIZES INNOCENCE GENTLENESS AND HOLINESS
HE RESPECTED THE VARIOUS DEITIES IN WHOM THE VARIOUS GROUPS OF PEOPLE REPOSED THEIR FAITH RESTORED DESPOILED TEMPLES AND RE-ENDOWED THEM WITH CHARACTERISTIC GENEROSITY

SIMILARLY SHISHAK THE EGYPTIAN PHARAOH HANDED OVER THE CITY OF GEZER WHICH HE HAD SUBDUED TO HIS DAUGHTER SOLOMON'S WIFE.[27 IN THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF ANCIENT SUMERIA THE FEMALE POPULATION EXERCISED AN UNDOUBTED INFLUENCE AND IN CERTAIN TEMPLES THERE WERE PRIESTESSES

IN OTHER WORDS WRITES DR LANGDON LATER THEOLOGY EVOLVED THE NOTION OF THE SON OF THE EARTH GOD WHO ACQUIRES THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE FATHER AND BECOMES THE GOD OF WAR
THE VARIOUS SYMBOLS MAY HAVE REPRESENTED PHASES OF THE GOD
INDEED THE AVERAGE MONARCH HAD A TEMPERAMENT RESEMBLING THAT OF KEATS WHO DECLARED
AND WHEN HE HUMBLED HIMSELF THE WRATH OF THE LORD TURNED FROM HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT DESTROY HIM ALTOGETHER
THEN THE TRETA YUGA IS 2400 + 1200 = 3600 DIVINE YEARS AND KRITA YUGA 3600 + 1200 = 4800 DIVINE YEARS
THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF BEN-HADAD THE SON OF HAZAEL ALL THEIR DAYS THEN JEHOAHAZ REPENTED
THE PERIOD WHICH FOLLOWED THE FALL OF THE HAMMURABI DYNASTY OF BABYLONIA IS AS OBSCURE AS THE HYKSOS AGE OF EGYPT
LIKE THE FAIRIES AND HAGS OF EUROPE SHE STOLE OR AFFLICTED CHILDREN WHO ACCORDINGLY HAD TO WEAR CHARMS ROUND THEIR NECKS FOR PROTECTION

IT IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT THEY WERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OF THE EARLY OUTPOURINGS OF NOMADIC PEOPLES FROM ARABIA A COUNTRY WHICH IS FAVOURABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A LARGER POPULATION THAN IT IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN PERMANENTLY ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS NATURAL RESOURCES ARE RESTRICTED BY A SUCCESSION OF ABNORMALLY DRY YEARS
IT IS SO GOOD THAT IT RETURNS AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDREDFOLD FOR THE AVERAGE AND WHEN IT BEARS AT ITS BEST IT PRODUCES THREE HUNDREDFOLD
HE CLOVE HER SKULL WITH HIS GREAT CLUB
THEIR MODE OF LIFE NECESSITATED A KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE'S LAWS
AND THE SHEEN OF THEIR SPEARS WAS LIKE STARS OF THE SEA WHEN THE BLUE WAVE ROLLS NIGHTLY ON DEEP GALILEE

THERE YEARS LATER NEBUCHADREZZAR I OF THE DYNASTY OF PASHE SEIZED THE BABYLONIAN THRONE
IN FACT AS IS INDICATED BY A PASSAGE IN THE BOOK OF SAMUEL THEY HAD MADE A CORNER IN THAT METAL AND RESTRICTED ITS USE AMONG THEIR VASSALS
THESE EITHER REFLECT THE ATTRIBUTES OF ASHUR OR CONSTITUTE THE MATERIAL FROM WHICH HE EVOLVED
LIKE THE INDIAN BRAHMA HE MAY HAVE BEEN IN HIS HIGHEST FORM AN IMPERSONATION OR SYMBOL OF THE SELF POWER OR WORLD SOUL OF DEVELOPED NATURALISM--THE CREATOR PRESERVER AND DESTROYER IN ONE A GOD OF WATER EARTH AIR AND SKY OF SUN MOON AND STARS FIRE AND LIGHTNING A GOD OF THE GROVE WHOSE ESSENCE WAS IN THE FIG OR THE FIR CONE AS IT WAS IN ALL ANIMALS
THAT IN THE MERRY MONTHS O SPRING DELIGHTED ME TO HEAR THEE SING WHAT COMES O THEE
FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD
IT WAS EXTREMELY PROFITABLE FOR THESE PRIESTS TO PERPETUATE THE BELIEF THAT THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WERE CONSIGNED TO A GLOOMY HADES WHERE THE DEGREE OF SUFFERING WHICH THEY ENDURED DEPENDED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THEIR BODIES WERE DISPOSED OF UPON EARTH
SIR HENRY RAWLINSON BEGAN THE ISSUE OF HIS MONUMENTAL WORK THE CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS OF WESTERN ASIA ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM

A SHARP CONTRAST IS PRESENTED BY THE MONGOLIAN BURIATS WHOSE OUTLOOK ON THE SPIRIT WORLD IS LESS GLOOMY THAN WAS THAT OF THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS
THE HISTORY OF BABYLONIAN RELIGION IS DIVIDED INTO PERIODS OF GROWTH AND PERIODS OF DECADENCE
357 SUMERIAN ZIKU APPARENTLY DERIVED FROM ZI THE SPIRITUAL ESSENCE OF LIFE THE SELF POWER OF THE UNIVERSE
AS MUCH MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE CONTRASTING CONCEPTIONS OF THE PATRIARCHS OF VEDIC AND SUMERIAN MYTHOLOGIES
DISCONTENTED AND UNEMPLOYED OFFICIALS AND MANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DESPOILED LEISURED AND MILITARY CLASSES OF LAGASH NO DOUBT SOUGHT REFUGE ELSEWHERE AND FOSTERED THE SPIRIT OF REVOLT WHICH EVER SMOULDERED IN SUBJECT STATES
WHEN THAT PLANET WAS AT ITS BRIGHTEST PHASE ITS RAYS WERE REFERRED TO AS THE BEARD OF THE GODDESS
IN BELIEVING THAT CERTAIN DEMONS CAUSED CERTAIN DISEASES THEY MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ACHIEVED DISTINCT PROGRESS FOR THEY ANTICIPATED THE GERM THEORY
IT IS NECESSARY TO ACCUMULATE THESE DETAILS REGARDING OTHER DEITIES AND THEIR SYMBOLS BEFORE DEALING WITH ASHUR
HERE MAY HAVE COLLECTED EVICTED AND REBEL BANDS OF ELAMITES AND SUMERIANS AND VARIOUS GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE HAMMURABI REGIME
OLD MERODACH BALADAN WAS CONCERNED IN THE PLOT AND TOOK REFUGE ON THE ELAMITE COAST WHERE THE CHALDAEANS HAD FORMED A COLONY

GAZA AND ASKALON WERE CAPTURED
MANASSEH SHED INNOCENT BLOOD VERY MUCH TILL HE HAD FILLED JERUSALEM FROM ONE END TO ANOTHER."[540 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS A REFERENCE TO ISAIAH'S FATE IN AN EARLY CHRISTIAN LAMENT REGARDING THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE FAITHFUL
LIKE SUMU-LA-ILU HE WAS A GREAT BATTLE LORD AND WAS SPECIALLY CONCERNED IN CHALLENGING THE SUPREMACY OF ELAM IN SUMERIA AND IN THE WESTERN LAND OF THE AMORITES

EA-BANI WAS ATTRACTED TO ERECH BY THE GIFT OF A FAIR WOMAN FOR WIFE
A SIMILAR MYTH WAS ATTACHED IN INDIA TO THE MEMORY OF KARNA THE HECTOR OF THAT GREAT SANSKRIT EPIC THE MAHABHARATA
THERE IS A REFERENCE TO AN ELAMITE RAID WHICH ALTHOUGH REPULSED MAY BE REGARDED AS PROOF OF DISTURBED POLITICAL CONDITIONS

ACCORDING TO HEBRIDEAN FOLK BELIEF THE FALLEN ANGELS ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE CLASSES--THE FAIRIES THE NIMBLE MEN AURORA BOREALIS AND THE BLUE MEN OF THE MINCH IN BEOWULF THE BROOD OF CAIN INCLUDES MONSTERS AND ELVES AND SEA-DEVILS--GIANTS ALSO WHO LONG TIME FOUGHT WITH GOD FOR WHICH HE GAVE THEM THEIR REWARD".[104 SIMILARLY THE BABYLONIAN SPIRIT GROUPS ARE LIABLE TO DIVISION AND SUBDIVISION
AMONG THE AGRICULTURAL CLASSES THE FOLK RELIGION WHICH ENTERED SO INTIMATELY INTO THEIR CUSTOMS AND LABOURS MUST HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY BABYLONISH IN CHARACTER
THE KING'S PALACE AND THE TEMPLE OF BEL MERODACH WERE SURROUNDED BY WALLS
CYRUS ADVANCED WESTWARD AGAINST CROESUS OF LYDIA BEFORE THAT MONARCH COULD RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM THE INTRIGUING BUT PLEASURE-LOVING AMASIS OF EGYPT
THE FIRST MONEY TAKEN EACH DAY BY FISHWIVES AND OTHER DEALERS IS SPAT UPON TO ENSURE INCREASED DRAWINGS
IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO FIND IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE BODIES OF ENEMIES WHO WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE WERE NOT GIVEN DECENT BURIAL BUT MUTILATED AND LEFT FOR BIRDS AND BEASTS OF PREY TO DEVOUR
GIFTS WERE ALSO SENT FROM ASSYRIA TO EGYPT TO FAN THE FLAME OF CORDIAL RELATIONS
THESE OCCUPIED A SQUARE WHICH WAS MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILE IN CIRCUMFERENCE
HE WAS NADIMMUD GOD OF EVERYTHING CHAPTER III

FATHER NANNAR LORD GOD SIN RULER AMONG THE GODS
ILK HAPPING BIRD WEE HELPLESS THING
HE WAS NAMED EA-BANI WHICH SIGNIFIES EA IS MY CREATOR IT IS POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT AN ANCIENT MYTH OF ERIDU FORMS THE BASIS OF THE NARRATIVE
LETTERS WERE OFTEN SENT BY MESSENGERS WHO WERE NAMED BUT THERE ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF POSTAL SYSTEM
ANU AND BEL AND EA HAVE THEE RAISED TO RANK SUPREME IN MAJESTY AND POW'R THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEE ABOVE THE GODS AND ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN
HE PROVIDED THEM WITH FOOD AND THEY IN TURN FED HIM WITH OFFERINGS
HE ALSO ACQUIRED A FURTHER PORTION OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF MITANNI WITH THE RESULT THAT HE EXERCISED SWAY OVER PART OF NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA
THERE WAS NO SURER WAY OF STRANGLING IT THAN BY SECURING CONTROL OF ITS TRADE ROUTES
THE LIFE OF THE GOD WAS IN THE SUN EGG IN AN INDIAN PROSE TREATISE IT IS SET FORTH
IF HOWEVER IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY DID NOT AGREE THE MONEY MIGHT BE PAID BACK

ONE OF THE TITLES OF NIN-GIRSU WAS EN-MERSI WHICH ACCORDING TO ASSYRIAN EVIDENCE WAS ANOTHER NAME OF TAMMUZ THE SPRING GOD WHO SLEW THE STORM AND WINTER DEMONS AND MADE THE LAND FERTILE SO THAT MAN MIGHT HAVE FOOD

EARLY IN HIS REIGN ESARHADDON CONDUCTED MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THE WEST AND DURING HIS ABSENCE THE QUEEN-MOTHER NAKI'A HELD THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT

WHEN THE SURVIVING GODS RETURN THEY WILL TALK ACCORDING TO THE VALA PROPHETESS OF THE GREAT WORLD SERPENT TIAMAT THE FIELDS WILL BE SOWN AND BALDER WILL COME"[242]--APPARENTLY AS TAMMUZ CAME
SOME SUCH EXPLANATION IS NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SPECIALIZATION OF CERTAIN GODDESSES AS FISH SNAKE CAT OR BIRD DEITIES
THE ANIMAL MIGHT BE THE SOURCE OF THE FOOD SUPPLY OR MIGHT HAVE TO BE PROPITIATED TO ENSURE THE FOOD SUPPLY
CHIEFS WERE SKINNED ALIVE AND WHEN HE SACKED THEIR CITIES NOT ONLY FIGHTING-MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE
IT IS EXQUISITELY SHAPED AND HAS A BASE OF COPPER
HE SENT MESSENGERS TO HEZEKIAH SAYING
THE MOST SURPRISING AND SENSATIONAL CONSPIRACY AGAINST ASHUR-BANI-PAL WAS FOMENTED BY HIS BROTHER SHAMASH-SHUM-UKIN OF BABYLON AFTER THE TWO HAD CO-OPERATED PEACEFULLY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
THE WIND WHISPERED BECAUSE A SPIRIT WHISPERED IN IT
WITHAL THEY DRANK BLOOD LIKE RAVENS AND DEVOURED CORPSES LIKE HYAENAS
SO SAUSHATAR RAIDED ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE REIGN OF THOTHMES III OR SOON AFTER HIS SUCCESSOR AMENHOTEP II ASCENDED THE EGYPTIAN THRONE
THEY WORSHIPPED THE FOLLOWING DEITIES
BUT ASHUR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN TO BEGIN WITH MERELY A BATTLE AND SOLAR DEITY

THE SEVEN DEMONS WHO WERE HIS MESSENGERS RECALL THE STORMY MARUTS THE FOLLOWERS OF INDRA
THE ARYAN HELLENES SAYS DR FARNELL WERE ABLE TO PLANT THEIR ZEUS AND POSEIDON ON THE HIGH HILL OF ATHENS BUT NOT TO OVERTHROW THE SUPREMACY OF ATHENA IN THE CENTRAL SHRINE AND IN THE ABORIGINAL SOUL OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE."[139 AS IN EGYPT THE BELIEFS OF THE FATHER WORSHIPPERS REPRESENTED BY THE SELF-CREATED PTAH WERE FUSED WITH THE BELIEFS OF THE MOTHER WORSHIPPERS WHO ADORED ISIS MUT NEITH AND OTHERS

ASHUR-DAN INFLICTED A CRUSHING DEFEAT UPON THE SECOND-LAST KASSITE RULER
THEY WERE ULTIMATELY REBORN AS THE FIVE PANDAVA WARRIORS.[132 THE FEROCIOUS BLACK-FACED SCOTTISH MOTHER GODDESS CAILLEACH BHEUR WHO APPEARS TO BE IDENTICAL WITH MALA LITH GREY EYEBROWS OF FINGALIAN STORY AND THE ENGLISH BLACK ANNIS FIGURES IN IRISH SONG AND LEGEND AS THE OLD WOMAN OF BEARE THIS OLD WOMAN CAILLEACH HAD SAYS PROFESSOR KUNO MEYER SEVEN PERIODS OF YOUTH ONE AFTER ANOTHER SO THAT EVERY MAN WHO HAD LIVED WITH HER CAME TO DIE OF OLD AGE AND HER GRANDSONS AND GREAT-GRANDSONS WERE TRIBES AND RACES WHEN OLD AGE AT LENGTH CAME UPON HER SHE SANG HER SWAN SONG FROM WHICH THE FOLLOWING LINES ARE EXTRACTED
THE DYNASTY OF JEHU HAD COME TO AN END BY THIS TIME
THAT I SHOULD MAKE THEE A DESOLATION AND THE INHABITANTS THEREOF AN HISSING
THE KASSITE FOR INSTANCE WAS A UNIFYING AND THEREFORE A STRENGTHENING INFLUENCE IN BABYLONIA
AND THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE SHALL SHINE NO MORE AT ALL IN THEE
NERGAL MADE READY TO CUT OFF HER HEAD BUT SHE CRIED FOR MERCY AND SAID
THESE EXAMPLES OF ARCHAIC GODS HOWEVER ARE NOT BEARDED IN SEMITIC FASHION
YET IT NEVER LOST ITS PRE-EMINENT POSITION DESPITE THE ATTEMPTS OF RIVAL STATES JEALOUS OF ITS GLORY AND INFLUENCE TO SUSPEND ITS ACTIVITIES
MORE PROBABLY THEY REGARDED THEM AS FOREIGN DEVILS OTHER SEMITES HOWEVER WHO CAME AS TRADERS BRINGING WOOD STONE AND ESPECIALLY COPPER AND FORMED COMMUNITIES IN CITIES MAY WELL HAVE INFLUENCED SUMERIAN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT
THIS WAS THE WIFE AND SISTER OF CAMBYSES

HE APPEARS IN HIS LATER CHARACTER AS A GOD OF CULTURE AND WISDOM THE PATRON OF SCRIBES AND ARTISTS AND THE WISE COUNSELLOR OF THE DEITIES

NABONIDUS ENGAGED HIMSELF ACTIVELY DURING HIS REIGN 556-540 B.C IN RESTORING TEMPLES
IN THE VERSION OF THE LATTER NARRATIVE WHICH IS GIVEN IN THE MAHABHARATA HANUMAN SAYS
THE JINN OF PRESENT-DAY ARABIANS ARE OF LIKE CHARACTER
A YEAR AFTER ASHUR-BANI-PAL DIED NABOPOLASSAR WHO WAS PROBABLY A CHALDAEAN WAS PROCLAIMED KING AT BABYLON
BABYLONIA IS A TREELESS COUNTRY AND TIMBER HAD TO BE IMPORTED FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
WITH THE REVIVAL OF AGRICULTURE WILL COME THE REVIVAL OF COMMERCE
FROM HIS WINGS THEY SAY COMES THE WIND WHICH FARES OVER ALL THE DWELLERS OF EARTH.[99 THE NORTHERN STORY OF THOR'S FISHING WHEN HE HOOKED AND WOUNDED THE MIDGARD SERPENT IS RECALLED BY THE BABYLONIAN LEGEND OF ADAPA SON OF THE GOD EA
THE TRIBES ROUND THE SHORES OF LAKE VAN HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
HIS DELIGHT WAS TO BE AMONG WATER DWELLERS
NOR ANY TREE IN THE GARDEN OF GOD WAS LIKE UNTO HIM IN HIS BEAUTY."[374 ASSHUR THE ANCIENT CAPITAL WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS MERCHANTS
HE HAD NOT REIGNED FOR LONG WHEN THE EMBERS OF REBELLION BURST INTO FLAME AND HE WAS MURDERED IN HIS PALACE
I WILL BREAK ALSO THE BAR OF DAMASCUS
ON FINN AIDED BY HIS FAIRY DOG SLEW THE WATER MONSTER
FOR A MOMENT HE FALTERED AND WHEN THE GODS WHO FOLLOWED HIM BEHELD THIS THEIR EYES WERE TROUBLED
MAY I IMPRISON THEE IN THE GREAT PRISON MAY THE GARBAGE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CITY BE THY FOOD MAY THE DRAINS OF THE CITY BE THY DRINK MAY THE DARKNESS OF THE DUNGEON BE THY DWELLING MAY THE STAKE BE THY SEAT MAY HUNGER AND THIRST STRIKE THY OFFSPRING
LUNAR ASTROLOGY WAS THEREFORE OF COMPLICATED CHARACTER
THEN ALMOST EVERY FRESH CONQUEST ACHIEVED BY ASSYRIA INVOLVED IT IN WAR WITH BABYLONIA WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN EVER WAITING FOR A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO CRIPPLE ITS NORTHERN RIVAL
ADVOCATES OF THE TOTEMIC THEORY ON THE OTHER HAND MAY HOLD THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF DOVES WITH SNAKE GODDESSES AND FISH GODDESSES OF FERTILITY WAS DUE TO THE FUSION OF TRIBES WHO HAD VARIOUS ANIMAL TOTEMS
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY NABONASSAR WHO BECAME HIS VASSAL AND HE OFFERED SACRIFICES IN THE CITIES OF BABYLON SIPPAR CUTHAH AND NIPPUR

TRIBES OF ARYAN SPEECH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE KASSITE INVADERS OF BABYLON WHO TOOK POSSESSION OF NORTHERN BABYLONIA SOON AFTER THE DISASTROUS HITTITE RAID
A NUMBER OF ARAMAEAN KINGDOMS HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE IN MESOPOTAMIA AND THROUGHOUT SYRIA
HE WAS DRIVEN FROM MEN AND DID EAT GRASS AS OXEN AND HIS BODY WAS WET WITH THE DEW OF HEAVEN TILL HIS HAIRS WERE GROWN LIKE EAGLES FEATHERS AND HIS NAILS LIKE BIRDS CLAWS."[207 THE HUNTER HAD NO DESIRE TO COMBAT WITH EA-BANI SO HE HAD HIM LURED FROM THE WILDS BY A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

IT IS PROBABLE THAT LIKE THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS THEY BELIEVED A GOD HAD AS MANY SPIRITS AS HE HAD ATTRIBUTES
IN THE COUNTRY OF DARKNESS ALEXANDER FED AND TAMED GREAT BIRDS WHICH WERE LARGER THAN EAGLES
THEY ROAST AND BOIL
THERE ARE ALSO TWO HEADS--A LION'S AND A MAN'S--WITH GAPING MOUTHS WHICH MAY SYMBOLIZE TEMPESTS THE DESTROYING POWER OF THE SUN OR THE SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES
PUT SONG AND MUSIC BEFORE THEE BEHIND THEE ALL EVIL THINGS AND REMEMBER THOU ONLY JOY.[212 JASTROW CONTRASTS THE BABYLONIAN POEM WITH THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM ECCLESIASTES GO THY WAY EAT THY BREAD WITH JOY AND DRINK THY WINE WITH A MERRY HEART

ONE OR TWO WERE SENT TO PARIS WHERE THEY WERE PROMPTLY DECLARED TO BE FORGERIES WITH THE RESULT THAT FOR A TIME THE INSCRIBED BRICKS WERE NOT A MARKETABLE COMMODITY
AND HAVING BEHELD IT WE ENTERED THAT CAVERN WHICH EXTENDED OVER MANY YOJANAS
AT ANY RATE WAR BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND TUKULTI-NINIP PROVED IRRESISTIBLE IN BATTLE
THE GOD WAS ACCORDINGLY ASKED IF SHAMASH-SHUM-UKIN COULD TAKE THE HANDS OF BEL IN ASHUR'S TEMPLE AND THEN PROCEED TO BABYLON AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE

NARAM SIN WAS THE LAST GREAT KING OF HIS LINE

THE VARIOUS THEORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOUNDED REGARDING THE OUTSIDE SOURCE OF SUMERIAN CULTURE ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT COMMENCED ABRUPTLY AND FULL GROWN
HIS IDENTIFICATION WITH MERODACH IF THAT WAS EVER ACCEPTED MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE LIKENESS OF THE WORD TO ASARI ONE OF THE DEITIES NAMES."[406 AS ASARI MERODACH HAS BEEN COMPARED TO THE EGYPTIAN OSIRIS WHO AS THE NILE GOD WAS ASAR-HAPI

A THIRD SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ARYAN RULERS OF THE MITANNIAN HITTITES WERE THE OVERLORDS OF NORTHERN BABYLONIA WHICH THEY INCLUDED IN THEIR MESOPOTAMIAN EMPIRE FOR A CENTURY BEFORE THE KASSITES ACHIEVED POLITICAL SUPREMACY IN THE TIGRO-EUPHRATES VALLEY AND THAT THEY WERE ALSO THE LEADERS OF THE HYKSOS INVASION OF EGYPT WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR HITTITE AND AMORITIC ALLIES
SIMILARLY BABYLONIA MAY BE REGARDED AS THE GIFT OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES--THOSE GREAT SHIFTING AND FLOODING RIVERS WHICH FOR LONG AGES HAD BEEN CARRYING DOWN FROM THE ARMENIAN HIGHLANDS VAST QUANTITIES OF MUD TO THRUST BACK THE WATERS OF THE PERSIAN GULF AND FORM A COUNTRY CAPABLE OF BEING UTILIZED FOR HUMAN HABITATION

TAMMUZ AND HORUS MAY HAVE BEEN PERSONIFICATIONS OF THE POWER OR WORLD SOUL VAGUELY RECOGNIZED IN THE STAGE OF NATURALISM

POSSIBLY ALL THE STATES WHICH OWED ALLEGIANCE TO THE KING OF THAT CITY BECAME AT ONCE THE WILLING VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THEIR PROTECTOR
THE FIRST MONARCH WITH AN ELAMITE NAME WHO BECAME CONNECTED WITH LARSA WAS KUDUR-MABUG SON OF SHIMTI-SHILKHAK THE FATHER OF WARAD-SIN AND RIM-SIN
BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY DUE TO HER THAT ESARHADDON ESPOUSED THE CAUSE OF THE PRO-BABYLONIAN PARTY
KING OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHOSE SCHOLARLY WORK THE SEVEN TABLETS OF CREATION IS THE STANDARD WORK ON THE SUBJECT
CYAXARES RAISED THE SIEGE AND WENT AGAINST THEM BUT WAS DEFEATED
A CHALDAEAN REVOLT WAS INEVITABLE

FOR CENTURIES THE MINGLING PEOPLES MUST HAVE BEEN BILINGUAL AS ARE MANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF IRELAND WALES AND THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS IN THE PRESENT AGE BUT ULTIMATELY THE LANGUAGE OF THE SEMITES BECAME THE PREVAILING SPEECH IN SUMER AND AKKAD

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF SHAMSHI-ADAD SON OF SHALMANESER III HAVE LITERARY QUALITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THOSE OF HIS PREDECESSORS AND MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY BABYLONIAN SCHOLARS WHO MIGRATED NORTHWARD
SEMIRAMIS WAS ACTUALLY AN ASSYRIAN QUEEN OF REVERED MEMORY
WE CAN SEE THE SLIM SHAVEN SUMERIANS GAZING WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION ON THEIR ROUGH HEROIC ALLY

THIS IS OUR LIFE AND MANNER OF LIVING IN THE DARKNESS OF OUR TOMBS WHEN ALEXANDER DESIRED TO MAKE A GIFT TO THESE BRAHMANS AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY DESIRED MOST THEIR ANSWER WAS GIVE US IMMORTALITY".[249 IN THE GILGAMESH EPIC THE ONLY RAY OF HOPE WHICH RELIEVES THE GLOOMY CLOSING PASSAGES IS EA-BANI'S SUGGESTION THAT THE SUFFERINGS ENDURED BY THE DEAD MAY BE ALLEVIATED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF STRICT BURIAL RITES
EACH FOREIGN ELEMENT IN A COMMUNITY HAD ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL LIFE AND IMMEMORIAL TRIBAL TRADITIONS WHICH REFLECTED ANCIENT HABITS OF LIFE AND PERPETUATED THE DOCTRINES OF EPONYMOUS ANCESTORS
THE WAY IS FULL OF PERIL
MITRA WHO WAS IDENTICAL WITH YAMA RULED OVER DEPARTED SOULS IN THE LAND OF THE PITRIS FATHERS WHICH WAS REACHED BY CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS AND THE RUSHING STREAM OF DEATH.[75 AS WE HAVE SEEN THE BABYLONIAN SOLAR GOD NERGAL WAS ALSO THE LORD OF THE DEAD
THEIR BEGETTER WAS APSU THE FATHER OF THE PRIMORDIAL DEEP AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TIAMAT THE SPIRIT OF CHAOS
SIPPAR WAS PLUNDERED AND ITS GODS CARRIED AWAY
THEREAFTER HIS ARMY CROSSED THE EUPHRATES IN BOATS OF SKIN AND PLUNDERED AND DESTROYED SIX CITIES ROUND THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN OF BISHRU
THE ARAMAEAN STATE OF DAMASCUS WHICH HAD WITHSTOOD THE ATTACK OF THE GREAT SHALMANESER AND AFTERWARDS OPPRESSED AS WE HAVE SEEN THE KINGDOMS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH WAS COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED BY ADAD-NIRARI
THEN HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BITTERLY AND THE TEARS STREAMED OVER HIS FACE
IN THIS EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THE WIDESPREAD TOTEMIC BELIEFS APPEAR TO HAVE HAD ORIGIN
DO NOT BE LIKE BAD SPIRITS
NEBO WHOM ADAD-NIRARI EXALTED AT KALKHI WAS MORE THAN A LOCAL GOD OF BORSIPPA
AND LIKE ANSHAR HE HAD ASSOCIATED WITH HIM SIX DIVINITIES OF COUNCIL OTHER DEITIES WHO WERE SIMILARLY EXALTED AS HIGH HEADS AT VARIOUS CENTRES AND AT VARIOUS PERIODS INCLUDED ANU BEL ENLIL AND EA MERODACH NERGAL AND SHAMASH

INDEED HIS ANXIETY FOR THEIR WELFARE WAS THE MOST PRONOUNCED FEATURE OF HIS CHARACTER
THE RISKS THEY RAN IN BABYLONIA MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR ULTIMATE DISAPPEARANCE IN THAT COUNTRY
ANOTHER BABYLONIAN LADY OF THE GODS WAS AMA MAMA OR MAMI THE CREATRESS OF THE SEED OF MANKIND AND WAS PROBABLY SO CALLED AS THE MOTHER OF ALL THINGS".[76 A CHARACTERISTIC ATMOSPHERIC DEITY WAS RAMMAN THE RIMMON OF THE BIBLE THE SEMITIC ADDU ADAD HADAD OR DADU
HE WAS SUCCEEDED BY SHALMANESER V 727-722 B.C WHO MAY HAVE BEEN HIS SON BUT THIS IS NOT QUITE CERTAIN
MENUAS WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON ARGISTIS WHO ASCENDED THE THRONE DURING THE LIFETIME OF ADAD-NIRARI OF ASSYRIA
HE MAY HAVE SACRIFICED THE BULL TO MITHRA
THE SUN GOD ALSO ILLUMINED THE WORLD AND HIS RAYS PENETRATED EVERY QUARTER
SUDDENLY THE MOTHER CALLED OUT THE CHILD'S NAME IN AGONIZED VOICE
AND I WILL CONVEY THEM BY SEA IN FLOATS UNTO THE PLACE THAT THOU SHALT APPOINT ME AND WILL CAUSE THEM TO BE DISCHARGED THERE AND THOU SHALT RECEIVE THEM
BUT TO ENABLE US TO DEAL WITH THE NEW SITUATION WHICH WAS CREATED BY EGYPT IN MESOPOTAMIA IT IS NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO TRACE THE RISE OF ASSYRIA WHICH WAS DESTINED TO BECOME FOR A PERIOD THE DOMINATING POWER IN WESTERN ASIA AND ULTIMATELY IN THE NILE VALLEY ALSO
THESE TRANSACTIONS WHICH WERE RECORDED ON A MONUMENT SUBSEQUENTLY CARRIED OFF WITH OTHER SPOILS BY THE ELAMITES AND DISCOVERED AT SUSA SHOW THAT AT THIS EARLY PERIOD ABOUT 2600 B.C EVEN A CONQUERING MONARCH CONSIDERED IT ADVISABLE TO OBSERVE EXISTING LAND LAWS
BUT THE ETHNIC CLUE THUS AFFORDED IS EXCEEDINGLY VAGUE
THE CROWN PRINCE MATTIUZA FLED TO BABYLON WHERE HE FOUND PROTECTION BUT WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE ANY ASSISTANCE
FOR HER SINS HAVE REACHED UNTO HEAVEN AND GOD HATH REMEMBERED HER INIQUITIES
THEY WERE THEREFORE PROVIDED WITH HOUSES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE LIVING WERE PROTECTED IN THEIR HOUSES ABOVE THE GROUND

LET ME SIT DOWN AND WEEP BUT TELL ME REGARDING THE LAND OF SPIRITS THE TEXT IS MUTILATED HERE BUT IT CAN BE GATHERED THAT EA-BANI DESCRIBED THE LAND WHERE ILL-DOERS WERE PUNISHED WHERE THE YOUNG WERE LIKE THE OLD WHERE THE WORM DEVOURED AND DUST COVERED ALL

THE HEBREW PATRIARCH MAY THEREFORE HAVE BEEN A CONTEMPORARY OF HAMMURABI'S WHO IS IDENTIFIED WITH AMRAPHEL KING OF SHINAR SUMER IN THE BIBLE.[149 BUT AFTER THE DECLINE OF UR'S ASCENDANCY AND LONG BEFORE BABYLON'S GREAT MONARCH CAME TO THE THRONE THE CENTRE OF POWER IN SUMERIA WAS SHIFTED TO ISIN WHERE SIXTEEN KINGS FLOURISHED FOR TWO AND A QUARTER CENTURIES

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CONQUEST OF A CONSIDERABLE PART OF PALESTINE BY THE PHILISTINES WAS NOT UNCONNECTED WITH THE REVIVAL OF HITTITE POWER IN THE NORTH
CULTURE WAS REALLY A BY-PRODUCT OF TEMPLE ACTIVITIES

FOR A TIME IT ACKNOWLEDGED THE SUZERAINTY OF KISH BUT ULTIMATELY IT THREW OFF THE OPPRESSOR'S YOKE AND ASSERTED ITS INDEPENDENCE
IT WAS IMPERATIVE ON HIS PART THEREFORE TO TAKE ACTION WITHOUT DELAY
MERODACH WAS SIMILARLY OF COMPLEX CHARACTER--A COMBINATION OF EA ANU ENLIL AND TAMMUZ WHO ACQUIRED WHEN EXALTED BY THE AMORITIC DYNASTY OF BABYLON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE THUNDER GOD ADAD-RAMMAN IN THE FORM OF AMURRU LORD OF THE MOUNTAINS DURING THE HAMMURABI AGE AMURRU WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POPULAR IN PERSONAL NAMES
ONCE BABYLON BECAME THE METROPOLIS IT RETAINED ITS PRE-EMINENCE UNTIL THE END
NOT ONLY THE MODERN PEOPLES BUT THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS AND THE PHOENICIANS ALSO HAVE BEEN TRACED TO THE SAME SOURCE
THE OLDEST HYMNS GIVE INDICATION OF THE RESPECT SHOWN TO WOMEN BY MAKING REFERENCE TO MIXED ASSEMBLIES AS FEMALES AND MALES JUST AS PRESENT-DAY ORATORS ADDRESS THEMSELVES TO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN THE LATER SEMITIC ADAPTATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTIONS IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE THIS CONVENTIONAL REFERENCE WAS ALTERED TO MALE AND FEMALE IF INFLUENCES HOWEVER WERE AT WORK TO RESTRICT THE POSITION OF WOMEN THEY DID NOT MEET WITH MUCH SUCCESS BECAUSE WHEN HAMMURABI CODIFIED EXISTING LAWS THE ANCIENT RIGHTS OF WOMEN RECEIVED MARKED RECOGNITION
HE CORRESPONDED BOTH WITH HIS COUSIN AMENHOTEP III AND HIS SON-IN-LAW AKHENATON

NOR COULD ANY MAN TELL WHEN HIS HOUR WOULD COME
DURING HIS ABSENCE FROM HOME THE OLD ASSYRIAN PARTY WHO DISLIKED THE EMPEROR BECAUSE OF BABYLONIAN SYMPATHIES HAD BEEN INTRIGUING REGARDING THE SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE
THE EXPLANATION SUGGESTED IS THAT THE SUMERIANS GAVE THEIR DEITIES HUMAN SHAPE BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE CLEAN SHAVEN AND THAT THE RETENTION OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FACIAL HAIR GROWTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE CONSERVATISM OF THE RELIGIOUS INSTINCT
THE MONEYLENDER HAD TO SHARE RISKS WITH BORROWERS

SOULS REACH IT BY THE PASS OF YOMI THE MIKADO HOWEVER MAY BE PRIVILEGED TO ASCEND TO HEAVEN AND JOIN THE GODS IN THE ETERNAL LAND AMONG THE ANCIENT ROMANS THE PRIMITIVE BELIEF SURVIVED THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE DEAD JUST SANK INTO THE EARTH WHERE IT RESTED AND RETURNED FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE UPPER WORLD THROUGH CERTAIN OPENINGS IN THE GROUND MUNDI WHOSE SOLEMN UNCOVERING WAS ONE OF THE REGULAR OBSERVANCES OF THE FESTAL CALENDAR".[248 ACCORDING TO BABYLONIAN BELIEF THE DEAD WHO WERE NOT PROPERLY BURIED ROAMED THROUGH THE STREETS SEARCHING FOR FOOD EATING REFUSE AND DRINKING IMPURE WATER
BY A SIMILAR PROCESS EACH ROUND OF 9 ON THE RIGHT HAND IS RECORDED BY THE LEFT UP TO 12
502 IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THIS CITY OR KULLANI IN NORTH SYRIA IT THE BIBLICAL CALNO
BUT HAVING RESCUED THE GODS FROM DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF KINGU AND TIAMAT HE WAS GREATER THAN HIS FATHERS THE ELDER GODS
THEIR CHIEF DEITY WAS THE SKY AND MOUNTAIN GOD WHO WAS THE WORLD FATHER THE CREATOR AND THE WIELDER OF THE THUNDER HAMMER WHO WAGED WAR AGAINST THE DEMONS OF STORM OR DROUGHT AND ENSURED THE FOOD SUPPLY OF HIS WORSHIPPERS
DURING HIS EARLY BOYHOOD HE RESIDED IN ITALY AND HIS EDUCATION WHICH BEGAN THERE WAS CONTINUED IN SCHOOLS IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND ENGLAND
ESARHADDON THE ASSYRIAN KING IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CROWNED IN THAT CITY
OF ALL ITS ENERGETIC AND CAPABLE PATESIS THE MOST CELEBRATED WAS GUDEA WHO REIGNED SOMETIME BEFORE 2400 B.C
THE ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS RIPENED QUICKLY BEFORE THE END CAME
THE FATHER OF THE KING MY LORD ENTERED AND HE THE PRIEST OF SIN PLACED THE CROWN UPON HIS HEAD SAYING THUS
AS MUCH IS SUGGESTED BY THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE WHICH DEALS WITH THE WANDERINGS OF TERAH ABRAHAM AND LOT
BUT ONE GREAT AND DEEP-SEATED GRIEVANCE REMAINED
THESE ARE ETANA AND GILGAMESH TWO LEGENDARY KINGS WHO RESEMBLE TAMMUZ THE PATRIARCH REFERRED TO BY BEROSUS A FORM OF TAMMUZ THE SLEEPER OF THE SUMERIAN PSALMS
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE ATTACKED OPIS BUT HE DROVE THEM BACK AND ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION PENETRATED THEIR COUNTRY OVER THE WESTERN PART OF WHICH KNOWN AS ANSHAN HE ULTIMATELY IMPOSED HIS RULE
THE HUMAN-HEADED SNAKE OR THE SNAKE-HEADED MAN AND THE MAN WITH THE HORNS OF A WILD BULL AND THE LEGS OF A GOAT WERE HORRIBLE IN THE EXTREME
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEREFORE TO FIND THAT IMPORTED DEITIES ASSUMED BABYLONIAN CHARACTERISTICS AND WERE IDENTIFIED OR ASSOCIATED WITH BABYLONIAN GODS IN THE LATER IMPERIAL PANTHEON
THE SCULPTURES ARE THE FINEST PRODUCTIONS OF ASSYRIAN ART AND EMBRACE A WIDE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS--BATTLE SCENES HUNTING SCENES AND ELABORATE COURT AND TEMPLE CEREMONIES
A MARVELLOUS SPECTACLE IT IS
AND THEY POSSESSED SAMARIA AND DWELT IN THE CITIES THEREOF
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE WIDESPREAD TUNNEL STORIES HAD ORIGIN AMONG THE CAVE DWELLERS OF THE PALAEOLITHIC AGE WHO BELIEVED THAT DEEP CAVERNS WERE THE DOORS OF THE UNDERGROUND RETREATS OF DRAGONS AND GIANTS AND OTHER SUPERNATURAL ENEMIES OF MANKIND
LAW AND RELIGION BEING CLOSELY ASSOCIATED THEY HAD TO ADAPT THEIR GODS TO SUIT THE REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS
IT IS RECORDED THAT KING DUNGI PLUNDERED ITS FAMOUS TEMPLE OF THE HIGH HEAD E-SAGILA WHICH SOME IDENTIFY WITH THE TOWER OF BABEL SO AS TO SECURE TREASURE FOR EA'S TEMPLE AT ERIDU WHICH HE SPECIALLY FAVOURED

THE DEAD WILL BE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE LIVING WHEN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WAS INVADED IT WAS A COMMON CUSTOM TO BREAK OPEN THE TOMBS AND SCATTER THE BONES THEY CONTAINED
MAKE IT PLEASANT FOR THEE TO FOLLOW THY DESIRE WHILE THOU LIVEST
KINGU HE SEIZED WITH THE OTHERS
AS LAYARD POINTED OUT MANY YEARS AGO THE ASSYRIANS HAD A SACRED TREE WHICH BECAME CONVENTIONALIZED
THE ART OF WRITING--AND THEREFORE OF ALL LITERATURE--IS MORE PARTICULARLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIM
AS BLAKE PUT IT
ONE LIES ON THE GROUND CLUTCHING A SPEAR WHICH HAS PENETRATED HIS THROAT TWO ARE FALLING OVER A CLIFF WHILE OTHERS APPARENTLY SUE FOR MERCY

HE WENT UNTO LACHMU AND LACHAMU AND PROSTRATED HIMSELF HUMBLY BEFORE THEM
AT COMANA IN PONTUS SHE WAS KNOWN TO THE GREEKS AS MA A NAME WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN AS OLD AS THAT OF THE SUMERIAN MAMA THE CREATRIX OR MAMITU^M GODDESS OF DESTINY
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE ASSYRIANS WERE DEFEATED AND COMPELLED TO RETREAT
IN 851 B.C
TO RENDER THEM IMMORTAL HE GIVES THEM TO EAT FORBIDDEN FOOD BEING DECEIVED BY THE DAEVAS DEMONS WHAT WAS THIS FORBIDDEN FOOD
AFTER DEATH HIS SPIRIT APPEARED AT CERTAIN TIMES AND SEASONS AS A PLANET STAR OR CONSTELLATION
ASSHUR WAS THE FIRST CAPITAL OF ASSYRIA
THEY STAGGER BY DAY IN GLOOM
ACCORDING TO ONE ACCOUNT HIS DEATH WAS CAUSED BY THE FICKLE ISHTAR
IN 674 B.C
SOME MODERN WRITERS WHO ARE TOO PRONE TO REGARD ANCIENT PEOPLES FROM A TWENTIETH-CENTURY POINT OF VIEW EXPRESS GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER INTELLIGENT BABYLONIANS REALLY BELIEVED THAT SPIRITS CAME DOWN IN THE RAIN AND ENTERED THE SOIL TO RISE UP BEFORE MEN'S EYES AS STALKS OF BARLEY OR WHEAT
ON ITS GLEAMING BRANCHES HUNG CLUSTERS OF PRECIOUS STONES AND ITS LEAVES WERE OF LAPIS LAZULI
THEN TIAMAT WHOSE COMMANDS ARE UNCHANGEABLE AND MIGHTY EXALTED KINGU WHO HAD COME TO HER AID ABOVE ALL THE EVIL GODS
IT WILL THUS BE SEEN THAT BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY WAS A TENET OF THE INDIAN CULTS OF INDRA AND YAMA

SACRIFICIAL FIRES WERE LIT AND CAKES WERE BAKED AND OFFERED TO THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN IN THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM AND OTHER CITIES
HE WHO HATH BEEN SLAIN IN BATTLE THE GHOST SAID REPOSETH ON A COUCH DRINKING PURE WATER--ONE SLAIN IN BATTLE AS THOU HAST SEEN AND I HAVE SEEN
NOW IN THE FIRST YEAR OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD BY THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH MIGHT BE FULFILLED THE LORD STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THAT HE MADE A PROCLAMATION THROUGHOUT ALL HIS KINGDOM AND PUT IT ALSO IN WRITING SAYING THUS SAITH CYRUS KING OF PERSIA THE LORD GOD OF HEAVEN HATH GIVEN ME ALL KINGDOMS OF THE EARTH
OTHER DEITIES WERE SIMILARLY EXALTED IN OTHER STATES
THE NEW PALACE WAS OCCUPIED IN 708 B.C
AT THIS POINT THE NARRATIVE BREAKS OFF FOR THE TABLET IS MUTILATED
BUT ISIN AGAIN GATHERED STRENGTH UNDER UR-NINIP WHO WAS NOT RELATED TO HIS PREDECESSOR
WHILE RESIDENT AT BAGHDAD HE DEVOTED HIS LEISURE TIME TO CUNEIFORM STUDIES
BEFORE THEY BROKE AWAY FROM THE PARENT STOCK IN ITS AREA OF CHARACTERIZATION THEY HAD ACQUIRED THE ELEMENTS OF CULTURE AND ADOPTED HABITS OF THOUGHT WHICH WERE BASED ON THE AGRICULTURAL MODE OF LIFE
HORUS THE EGYPTIAN FALCON GOD WAS SYMBOLIZED AS THE WINGED SOLAR DISC
WHEN A MAN IS ILL HE WROTE THEY LAY HIM IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE AND THE PASSERS-BY COME UP TO HIM AND IF THEY HAVE EVER HAD HIS DISEASE THEMSELVES OR HAVE KNOWN ANYONE WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM IT THEY GIVE HIM ADVICE RECOMMENDING HIM TO DO WHATEVER THEY FOUND GOOD IN THEIR OWN CASE OR IN THE CASE KNOWN TO THEM
AS SHE WAS A WATER DEITY AND PERHAPS IDENTICAL WITH BELIT-SHERI SISTER OF TAMMUZ OF THE ABYSS AND DAUGHTER OF EA ONE OF THE CANALS WAS DEDICATED TO HER
UMMA HAD BEEN CAUSING ANXIETY IN LAGASH BUT EANNATUM STORMED AND CAPTURED THAT RIVAL CITY APPROPRIATED ONE OF ITS FERTILE PLAINS AND IMPOSED AN ANNUAL TRIBUTE TO BE PAID IN KIND

BE GLAD MY FRIEND
BROODING IN DARKNESS REGARDING THEIR FATE THEY EVIDENTLY ASSOCIATED THE STARS WITH THE FORCES WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR LIVES--THE GHOSTS OF ANCESTORS OF TOTEMS THE SPIRITS THAT BROUGHT FOOD OR FAMINE AND CONTROLLED THE SEASONS
FOR SEVERAL YEARS HE ENGAGED HIMSELF IN SECURING CONTROL OF THE NORTH-WESTERN CARAVAN ROAD AND DID NOT REST UNTIL HE HAD SUBDUED CILICIA AND OVERRUN THE HITTITE KINGDOMS OF TABAL AND MALATIA
ON HIS LONG HEAD HE HAS POISED DEFTLY A WOVEN BASKET CONTAINING THE CLAY WITH WHICH HE IS TO MAKE THE FIRST BRICK
ARE THE CHIEF DEITIES ON WHICH THE RITUAL ITSELF HINGES IN SOME TEMPLES THERE WAS A BIT RIMKI A HOUSE OF WASHING AND A BIT NURI A HOUSE OF LIGHT".[65 IT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE THAT FIRE WAS REGARDED AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE BY SOME CITY CULTS WHICH WERE INFLUENCED BY IMPORTED IDEAS
THERE ARE GIANTS GRAVES ALSO IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE GODS WERE SIMPLY FEROCIOUS GIANTS
PLUNDERING BANDS OF ARAMAEANS WERE MENACING THE WESTERN FRONTIERS AND HAD OVERRUN PART OF NORTHERN BABYLONIA
140 141
DURING HIS LEISURE HOURS THE KING ENGAGED HIMSELF IN STUDIOUS PURSUITS AND MADE ADDITIONS TO THE ROYAL LIBRARY
NEAR THE NAME IS AN EAR OF CORN AND OTHER SYMBOLS SUCH AS THE WINGED SOLAR DISC A GAZELLE AND SEVERAL STARS BUT THERE IS NO FISH
A GOOD LABARTU MIGHT ATTEND ON A HUMAN BEING LIKE A HOUSEHOLD FAIRY OF INDIA OR EUROPE
THEY REFER TO THE STARS CASTOR AND POLLUX AS TWO YOUNG MEN LIKE THE ANCIENT GREEKS WHILE THE AFRICAN BUSHMEN ASSERT THAT THESE STARS ARE TWO GIRLS
NECHO OF SAIS HAD TO BE ARRESTED AMONG OTHERS BUT WAS PARDONED AFTER HE APPEARED BEFORE ASHUR-BANI-PAL AND SENT BACK TO EGYPT AS THE ASSYRIAN GOVERNOR
DURING THE REIGN OF ADAD-NIRARI IV THIS COLLECTION WAS GREATLY INCREASED AND SUBSEQUENT ADDITIONS WERE MADE TO IT BY HIS SUCCESSORS AND ESPECIALLY ASHUR-NIRARI IV THE LAST MONARCH OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
EXCEPT ERIDU WHERE ANCIENT WORKERS QUARRIED SANDSTONE FROM ITS SEA-SHAPED RIDGE ALL THE CITIES WERE BUILT OF BRICK AN EXCELLENT CLAY BEING FOUND IN ABUNDANCE

OPEN THY MOUTH AND SPEAK WORDS OF COMMAND SO THAT THE GARMENT MAY BE DESTROYED
WHEN THE RULERS OF AKKAD CALLED THEMSELVES KINGS OF THE FOUR QUARTERS THE REFERENCE WAS TO THE COUNTRIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE DIVINE FIELDS AND TO GUTIUM[327](EAST = OUR NORTH-EAST WAS GUTIUM ASSOCIATED WITH DEMONS AS IN SCANDINAVIA THE NORTH-EAST WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GIANTS AGAINST WHOM THOR WAGED WAR
THE SEMITIC AKKADIANS ADOPTED THE DISTINCTIVE CULTURE OF THESE SUMERIANS AFTER SETTLEMENT AND EXERCISED AN INFLUENCE ON ITS SUBSEQUENT GROWTH
IN BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA THE PEOPLES OF THE GODDESS CULT FUSED WITH THE PEOPLES OF THE GOD CULT BUT THE PROMINENCE MAINTAINED BY ISHTAR WHO ABSORBED MANY OF THE OLD MOTHER DEITIES TESTIFIES TO THE PERSISTENCE OF IMMEMORIAL HABITS OF THOUGHT AND ANTIQUE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIALS AMONG THE DESCENDANTS OF THE EARLIEST SETTLERS IN THE TIGRO-EUPHRATES VALLEY

SAYCE HAS EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE BIBLICAL TIDAL IDENTIFIED WITH TUDKHUL OR TUDHULA KING OF NATIONS THE ALLY OF ARIOCH AMRAPHEL AND CHEDOR-LAOMER WAS A HITTITE KING THE NATIONS BEING THE CONFEDERACY OF ASIA MINOR TRIBES CONTROLLED BY THE HATTI

AGAINST HIM HOSHEA CAME UP SHALMANESER KING OF ASSYRIA
ENLIL WAS AFTERWARDS DISPLACED BY MERODACH OF BABYLON
LET ME DRINK AMONG THE TEETH
IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF COURSE THIS PROCESS WAS SLOW AND DIFFICULT
ADORED ART THOU IN EVERY SACRED PLACE IN TEMPLES HOLY DWELLINGS AND IN SHRINES WHERE IS THY NAME NOT LAUDED
DECAYED NO DOUBT BUT STILL SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING THEY MET WITH IN THE LAND ITSELF
HE WAS THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH WHO DEPORTED THE LOST TEN TRIBES IN THE NINTH YEAR OF HOSHEA AND THE FIRST OF SARGON THE KING OF ASSYRIA TOOK SAMARIA AND CARRIED ISRAEL AWAY INTO ASSYRIA AND PLACED THEM IN HALAH AND IN HABOR BY THE RIVER OF GOZAN AND IN THE CITIES OF THE MEDES."[522 IN ALL ACCORDING TO SARGON'S RECORD 27,290 PEOPLE DWELLING IN THE MIDST OF IT SAMARIA I CARRIED OFF THEY THE ISRAELITES LEFT ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD THEIR GOD AND MADE THEM MOLTEN IMAGES EVEN TWO CALVES AND MADE A GROVE AND WORSHIPPED ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN THE STARS AND SERVED BAAL
A PART OF THIS FORM OF THE LEGEND SURVIVES IN THE FAMOUS ASSYRIAN HYMN KNOWN AS THE DESCENT OF ISHTAR IT WAS FIRST TRANSLATED BY THE LATE MR GEORGE SMITH OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM
PAIN IN THE HEAD AND SHIVERING LIKE A SCUDDING CLOUD TURN UNTO THE FORM OF MAN
AS A GERMAN WRITER PUTS IT HIS DESPOTISM WAS A FORM OF PATRIARCHAL ABSOLUTISM
IT IS BELIEVED THAT JUDAH AND OTHER DISAFFECTED STATES WERE DEALT WITH ABOUT THIS TIME
ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WAS REFLECTED BY ASHUR BUT HE ALSO REFLECTED THE ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THAT GREATNESS
AGUM III A GRANDSON OF ULAMBURIASH FOUND IT NECESSARY HOWEVER TO INVADE SEALAND WHICH MUST THEREFORE HAVE REVOLTED
ON THE UPPER PART OF THE STELE WHICH IS NOW ONE OF THE TREASURES OF THE LOUVRE PARIS KING HAMMURABI SALUTES WITH HIS RIGHT HAND REVERENTLY UPRAISED THE SUN GOD SHAMASH SEATED ON HIS THRONE AT THE SUMMIT OF E-SAGILA BY WHOM HE IS BEING PRESENTED WITH THE STYLUS WITH WHICH TO INSCRIBE THE LEGAL CODE
THEREAFTER THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH THE VARIOUS GATES AND AT EACH SHE RECEIVED HER ROBE AND THE ORNAMENTS WHICH WERE TAKEN FROM HER ON ENTERING
PERFECT ORDER PREVAILED THROUGHOUT THE CITY WHICH WAS FIRMLY POLICED BY THE PERSIAN SOLDIERS AND THERE WAS NO LOOTING
BEL-ENLIL'S FAME AS A WAR DEITY WAS PROBABLY DUE TO THE POLITICAL SUPREMACY OF HIS CITY OF NIPPUR
AS THERE WERE IN EARLY TIMES VARIOUS CENTRES OF CULTURE WHICH HAD RIVAL PANTHEONS THE ADAPTED MYTHS VARIED GREATLY
IF THE HORN IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD WILL BE UPSET ALTOGETHER TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
HE HAD TROUBLE WITH UMMA A POWERFUL CITY WHICH LAY TO THE NORTH-WEST OF LAGASH BETWEEN THE SHATT-EL-KAI AND SHATT-EL-HAI CANALS
THE INSCRIPTIONS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR PROSE STYLE
THE WAILING IS FOR THE PERISHING WEDDED ONES
447 1 KINGS XVI 29-33
HIS SUBJECTS ALSO BUILT THEM HIGH PLACES AND IMAGES AND GROVES ON EVERY HIGH HILL AND UNDER EVERY GREEN TREE".[435 AFTER THE RAID OF THE EGYPTIAN PHARAOH SHISHAK SHESHONK REHOBOAM REPENTED HOWEVER
HARVEST LABOUR WAS PROBABLY FAR DEARER THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE THE SKILL AND EXERTION DEMANDED AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY WERE SEEKING FOR IT AT ONCE WHEN A FARM WORKER WAS ENGAGED HE RECEIVED A SHEKEL FOR EARNEST MONEY OR ARLES AND WAS PENALIZED FOR NON-APPEARANCE OR LATE ARRIVAL.[281 SO GREAT WAS THE POLITICAL UPHEAVAL CAUSED BY RIM-SIN AND HIS ALLIES AND IMITATORS IN SOUTHERN BABYLONIA THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN THAT SAMSU-ILUNA HAD RECAPTURED ERECH AND UR AND RESTORED THEIR WALLS
SARGON WAS NOW ABLE TO DEAL WITH BABYLONIA WHICH FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS HAD BEEN RULED BY MERODACH BALADAN WHO OPPRESSED THE PEOPLE AND SET AT DEFIANCE ANCIENT LAWS BY SEIZING PRIVATE ESTATES AND TRANSFERRING THEM TO HIS CHALDAEAN KINSMEN
THE GOD SHAMASH APPOINTED THE TIME SAYING
A REFERENCE TO THESE BANDITS APPEARS IN ONE OF THE TELL-EL-AMARNA LETTERS
POLITICS AND RELIGION WENT EVIDENTLY HAND IN HAND
APPARENTLY HE CAME BACK AS A CHILD
AMIDST THESE HORRORS OF SAVAGERY AND VENGEANCE THE NOW TRAGIC FIGURE OF THE GREAT REFORMER SUDDENLY VANISHES FROM BEFORE OUR EYES
AMONG THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND LINGUISTS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES WHO ARE DEVOTING THEMSELVES TO THE STUDY OF ANCIENT ASSYRIAN AND BABYLONIAN RECORDS AND LITERATURE AND GRADUALLY UNFOLDING THE STORY OF ANCIENT EASTERN CIVILIZATION THOSE OF OUR OWN COUNTRY OCCUPY A PROMINENT POSITION
AMONG THE GODS OF BABYLONIA NONE ACHIEVED WIDER AND MORE ENDURING FAME THAN TAMMUZ WHO WAS LOVED BY ISHTAR THE AMOROUS QUEEN OF HEAVEN--THE BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO DIED AND WAS MOURNED FOR AND CAME TO LIFE AGAIN
ITS MERCHANTS TRADED DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY WITH FAR-DISTANT COUNTRIES
PRIOR TO THE PERIOD OF CEREMONIAL BURIALS THE DEAD WERE INTERRED IN THE HOUSES IN WHICH THEY HAD LIVED--A CUSTOM WHICH HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PRESENT-DAY SCIENTISTS TO ACCUMULATE MUCH VALUABLE DATA REGARDING PRIMITIVE RACES AND THEIR HABITS OF LIFE
ON ONE SIDE ARE TWENTY-EIGHT COLUMNS AND ON THE OTHER SIXTEEN
HIS WORSHIP WAS CERTAINLY OF GREAT ANTIQUITY
ZEUS INSTRUCTED HIS HOST TO BUILD AN ARK OF OAK AND STORE IT WELL WITH FOOD
THE FACT THAT ISHTAR DESCENDED TO HADES IN QUEST OF TAMMUZ MAY PERHAPS EXPLAIN THE SYMBOLIC REFERENCES IN HYMNS TO MOTHER GODDESSES BEING IN SUNKEN BOATS ALSO WHEN THEIR POWERS WERE IN ABEYANCE AS WERE THOSE OF THE GOD FOR PART OF EACH YEAR
84 ACT IV SCENE 1
THE GODS OFFER HIM THE TABLETS OF FATE
CURTIUS NEARLY HALF OF THE AREA OCCUPIED BY THE CITY WAS TAKEN UP BY GARDENS WITHIN THE SQUARES
AND THE KINGDOM WAS QUIET BEFORE HIM
HISTORICAL CLUES ARE ALSO OBTAINED FROM LISTS OF YEAR NAMES
PHARAOH MENEPTAH THE SON OF RAMESES II DID NOT BENEFIT MUCH BY THE ALLIANCE WITH THE HITTITES TO WHOM HE HAD TO SEND A SUPPLY OF GRAIN DURING A TIME OF FAMINE
TWO WINGS OF EVERY ONE WERE JOINED ONE TO ANOTHER
149 GENESIS XIV
FOR THE SHIPS WERE BROKEN WRECKED AT EZION-GEBER AHAZIAH OFFERED HIM SAILORS--PROBABLY PHOENICIANS--BUT THEY WERE REFUSED.[453 APPARENTLY JEHOSHAPHAT HAD CLOSE TRADING RELATIONS WITH THE CHALDAEANS WHO WERE ENCROACHING ON THE TERRITORY OF THE KING OF BABYLON AND MENACING THE POWER OF THAT MONARCH
IT IS PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT THE BRITISH STORIES OF FEMALE MONSTERS WHO WERE MORE POWERFUL THAN THEIR HUSBANDS AND SONS ARE OF NEOLITHIC AND IBERIAN ORIGIN--IMMEMORIAL RELICS OF THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE WESTERN BRANCH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN RACE
IN SYRIA MENEPTAH FOUGHT WITH THE ISRAELITES WHO APPARENTLY HAD BEGUN THEIR CONQUEST OF CANAAN DURING HIS REIGN
A FLOOD LEGEND AMONG THE NAHUA TRIBES RESEMBLES CLOSELY THE BABYLONIAN STORY AS TOLD BY PIR-NAPISHTIM
BUT THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES IN WHICH THE TERM OF SERVICE WAS DIFFERENT--ONE MONTH HALF A YEAR OR A WHOLE YEAR
6 THE CULTURE GOD
THE SYMBOLIC DECORATIONS INCLUDE THE LION-HEADED EAGLE WHICH WAS PROBABLY A FORM OF THE SPRING GOD OF WAR AND FERTILITY THE LION BELOVED BY THE MOTHER GODDESS AND DEER AND IBEXES WHICH RECALL THE MOUNTAIN HERDS OF ASTARTE
NOT ONLY ISRAEL BUT JUDAH UNDER KING JOASH EDOM THE PHILISTINES AND THE AMMONITES WERE COMPELLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUZERAINTY OF DAMASCUS
SO DEEP WERE THE LAYERS OF MOULD ON EACH TERRACE THAT FRUIT TREES WERE GROWN AMIDST THE PLANTS OF LUXURIANT FOLIAGE AND THE BRILLIANT ASIAN FLOWERS
A NEW NATIONAL PANTHEON OF REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTER WAS ALSO FORMED OVER WHICH MERODACH MARDUK THE CITY GOD OF BABYLON PRESIDED
NO DOUBT IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA AS IN EUROPE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES THE MEN OF REFINEMENT AND INTELLECT AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES WERE ATTRACTED TO THE TEMPLES WHILE THE MORE ROBUST TYPES PREFERRED THE OUTDOOR LIFE AND ESPECIALLY THE LIFE OF THE SOLDIER.[302 THE PERMANENT TRIUMPHS OF BABYLONIAN CIVILIZATION WERE ACHIEVED EITHER BY THE PRIESTS OR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INFLUENCE THEY EXERCISED
98 ET SEQ 3 REVELATION XVIII
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION DURING THE LATTER PART OF HIS REIGN HE HAD TO DEAL WITH AGGRESSIVE BANDS OF AMORITES
HE CONJURED THEM WITH EMOTION

BE THOU MY HUSBAND AND I WILL BE THY BRIDE
I 1
THEY THAT SOW IN TEARS DAVID SANG SHALL REAP IN JOY
THESE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO WIDESPREAD MIGRATIONS OF PASTORAL PEOPLES FROM THE STEPPE LANDS OF ASIA AND EUROPE AND THE RESULTING DISPLACEMENT OF SETTLED TRIBES
IN THE DEDICATORY INSCRIPTION THE KING IS REFERRED TO AS A PATESI AND THE FACT THAT THE NAME OF THE HIGH PRIEST DUDU IS GIVEN MAY BE TAKEN AS AN INDICATION OF THE GROWING POWER OF AN AGGRESSIVE PRIESTHOOD
ITS EARLY KINGS WERE CONTEMPORARY WITH SOME OF THE LAST KASSITE MONARCHS AND THEY ENGAGED IN CONFLICTS WITH THE ELAMITES WHO WERE ENCROACHING STEADILY UPON BABYLONIAN TERRITORY AND WERE ULTIMATELY ABLE TO SEIZE THE PROVINCE OF NAMAR FAMOUS FOR ITS HORSES WHICH WAS SITUATED TO THE EAST OF AKKAD
AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE STOLE THE MOON GOBLET CONTAINING THE AMRITA WHICH GARUDA HAD DELIVERED TO HIS ENEMIES THE SERPENTS TO FREE HIS MOTHER FROM BONDAGE
THE GOD MERODACH WAS STILL A CAPTIVE IN THE TEMPLE OF ASHUR

I CANNOT TELL THEE MY FRIEND
THE DEIFIED ROMAN EMPEROR'S WAXEN IMAGE WAS BURNED ON A PYRE AFTER HIS DEATH AND AN EAGLE WAS LET LOOSE FROM THE GREAT PILE TO CARRY HIS SOUL TO HEAVEN.[199 THIS CUSTOM WAS PROBABLY A RELIC OF SEASONAL FIRE WORSHIP WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO NORTHERN AND WESTERN SYRIA AND ASIA MINOR BY THE MYSTERIOUS MITANNI RULERS IF IT WAS NOT AN ARCHAIC BABYLONIAN CUSTOM[200 ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE-AND-WATER MAGICAL CEREMONIES REPRESENTED IN THE BRITISH ISLES BY MAY-DAY AND MIDSUMMER FIRE-AND-WATER FESTIVALS
ORIGINALLY EA MAY HAVE BEEN A SACRED FISH
197 ET SEQ
IN EGYPT ISIS IS REFERRED TO IN A TEMPLE CHANT AS THE WOMAN WHO WAS MADE A MALE BY HER FATHER OSIRIS AND THE NILE GOD HAPI WAS DEPICTED AS A MAN WITH FEMALE BREASTS
IN SCOTLAND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT ON THE MORNING OF MAY DAY BELTAINE THE RISING SUN REVOLVED THREE TIMES
THE TUNNEL MAY RUN FROM A CASTLE TO THE SEASHORE FROM A CAVE ON ONE SIDE OF A HILL TO A CAVE ON THE OTHER OR FROM A SEASHORE CAVE TO A DISTANT ISLAND
FIRE WAS HOWEVER USED IN BABYLONIA FOR MAGICAL PURPOSES
GHOSTS AND EVIL SPIRITS WANDERED THROUGH THE STREETS IN DARKNESS
450 IBID XXII 43
THIS IS SHOWN CLEARLY BY THE FOLLOWING PREGNANT EXTRACT FROM A BABYLONIAN TABLET
IN ARMENIA SHE WAS ANAITIS
THIS CHANGE FROM ARTISAN GOD TO CREATOR NUDIMMUD MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE TENDENCY OF EARLY RELIGIOUS CULTS TO ATTACH TO THEIR CHIEF GOD THE ATTRIBUTES OF RIVALS EXALTED AT OTHER CENTRES
THE IMAGES OF THESE DEITIES WERE AFTERWARDS OBTAINED FROM KHANI MITANNI AT A LATER PERIOD WHEN WE COME TO KNOW MORE ABOUT MITANNI FROM THE LETTERS OF ONE OF ITS KINGS TO TWO EGYPTIAN PHARAOHS AND THE WINCKLER TABLETS FROM BOG-HAZ-KOEI IT IS FOUND THAT ITS MILITARY ARISTOCRACY SPOKE AN INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE AS IS SHOWN BY THE NAMES OF THEIR KINGS--SAUSHATAR ARTATAMA SUTARNA ARTASHSHUMARA TUSHRATTA AND MATTIUZA

HE FOUND THOUSANDS OF TABLETS MANY HAS RELIEFS VOTIVE STATUETTES WHICH WORSHIPPERS APPARENTLY PINNED ON SACRED SHRINES THE FAMOUS SILVER VASE OF KING ENTEMENA STATUES OF KING GUDEA AND VARIOUS OTHER TREASURES WHICH ARE NOW IN THE LOUVRE
BEAUTIFUL WERE THE TREES ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN AND THERE WERE MANY SHADY RETREATS THAT WERE FRAGRANT AND ALLURING
THERE WERE TWO DIALECTS IN ANCIENT SUMERIA AND THE INVOCATORY HYMNS WERE COMPOSED IN WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE WOMEN'S LANGUAGE IT MUST NOT BE INFERRED HOWEVER THAT THE LADIES OF SUMERIA HAD ESTABLISHED A SPEECH WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT USED BY MEN
IN TIME OF PEACE THE ASSYRIAN GOVERNOR DID HIS BEST TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST MOLESTATION ON THE PART OF THE NATIVES AND IN RETURN FOR THIS THEY RALLIED ROUND HIM WHENEVER THE LATTER THREATENED TO GET OUT OF HAND AND HELPED HIM TO STIFLE THE REVOLT OR HOLD IT IN CHECK UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF REINFORCEMENTS
THAT IS DEAL WITH HER AS YOU DEAL WITH OTHERS WHO COME HERE AS ISHTAR ENTERS THROUGH THE VARIOUS GATES SHE IS STRIPPED OF HER ORNAMENTS AND CLOTHING
A SCULPTOR OR STORYTELLER WHO DESIRED TO CONVEY AN IMPRESSION OF A SPIRIT OF STORM OR PESTILENCE CREATED MONSTROUS FORMS TO INSPIRE TERROR
GREAT STONE TERRACES RESTING ON ARCHES ROSE UP LIKE A GIANT STAIRWAY TO A HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AND THE WHOLE STRUCTURE WAS STRENGTHENED BY A SURROUNDING WALL OVER TWENTY FEET IN THICKNESS
THE PICTS OF SCOTLAND MAY HAVE SIMILARLY PAINTED THEMSELVES TO CHARM THEIR BODIES AGAINST MAGICAL INFLUENCES AND THE WEAPONS OF THEIR ENEMIES
THE WORSHIPPERS OF THE FISH GOD RETAINED ANCIENT MODES OF THOUGHT AND PERPETUATED ANCIENT SUPERSTITIOUS PRACTICES
THE SUN GOD TUM WHO WAS LINKED WITH RA AS RA-TUM SPAT ON THE GROUND AND HIS SALIVA BECAME THE GODS SHU AND TEFNUT
RACIAL UNITS MIGRATED FROM CULTURAL AREAS TO DISTRICTS SUITABLE FOR COLONIZATION AND CARRIED WITH THEM A HERITAGE OF IMMEMORIAL BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS WHICH WERE REGARDED AS BEING QUITE AS INDISPENSABLE FOR THEIR WELFARE AS THEIR IMPLEMENTS AND DOMESTICATED ANIMALS
MR JOHNS POINTS OUT IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NAMES OF USHPIA KIKIA AND ADASI WHO ACCORDING TO ASSYRIAN RECORDS WERE EARLY RULERS IN ASSHUR ARE NEITHER SEMITIC NOR SUMERIAN AN ANCIENT NAME OF THE GODDESS OF NINEVEH WAS SHAUSHKA WHICH COMPARES WITH SHAUSHKASH THE CONSORT OF TESHUP THE HITTITE-MITANNI HAMMER GOD
ASHUR-NATSIR-PAL III[429 WAS PRECEDED BY TWO VIGOROUS ASSYRIAN RULERS ADAD-NIRARI III 911-890 B.C AND TUKULTI-NINIP II 890-885 B.C THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST

IT INCLUDED SEVERAL CITY STATES LIKE TARSUS TIANA AND COMANA KAMMANU FARTHER WEST WAS THE DOMINION OF THE THRACO-PHRYGIAN MUSKI
THE GODDESSES ALONE WERE IMMORTAL
IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT ENLIL-BANI WHOSE NAME SIGNIFIES ENLIL IS MY CREATOR WAS A USURPER LIKE SARGON OF AKKAD AND HE MAY HAVE SIMILARLY CIRCULATED A MYTH REGARDING HIS MIRACULOUS ORIGIN TO JUSTIFY HIS SUDDEN RISE TO POWER
441 IBID 18-9
HE COMPOSED IN GREEK A HISTORY OF HIS NATIVE LAND WHICH HAS PERISHED
EA THE SUMERIAN LORD OF WATER EARTH AND HEAVEN WAS SYMBOLIZED AS A GOAT FISH THOR THE TEUTONIC FERTILITY AND THUNDER GOD HAD A CHARIOT DRAWN BY GOATS
THE FLOCK WAS THE GROUP OF HEAVENLY SPIRITS INVISIBLE BY DAY THE HOST OF HEAVEN"--MANIFESTATIONS OR GHOSTS OF THE EMISSARIES OF THE CONTROLLING POWER OR POWERS
THEY MADE READY FOR BATTLE
AN ASSYRIAN STANDARD WHICH PROBABLY REPRESENTED THE WORLD COLUMN HAS THE DISC MOUNTED ON A BULL'S HEAD WITH HORNS
FOR THE CUSTOM WAS THAT WHEN THE HERALD HAD GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE NUMBER OF THE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS HE SHOULD THEN CALL UP THE UGLIEST--A CRIPPLE IF THERE CHANCED TO BE ONE--AND OFFER HER TO THE MEN ASKING WHO WOULD AGREE TO TAKE HER WITH THE SMALLEST MARRIAGE PORTION
NO DOUBT THEY WERE WELCOMED IN THAT CAPACITY FOR OWING TO THE CONTINUOUS SPREAD OF CULTURE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMERCE RURAL LABOUR HAD BECOME SCARCE AND DEAR
A PATESI OF LAGASH HAD A CHARIOT WHICH WAS DRAWN BY ASSES
THEN ZEUS BROKE UP ALL THE FOUNTAINS OF THE DEEP AND OPENED THE WELL SPRINGS OF HEAVEN AND IT RAINED FOR FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS CONTINUALLY THE BRONZE FOLK PERISHED

SO THE KING OF ASSYRIA TURNED BACK AND STAYED NOT THERE IN THE LAND."[507 REZIN OF DAMASCUS HIRAM OF TYRE AND ZABIBI QUEEN OF THE ARABIANS ALSO SENT GIFTS TO TIGLATH-PILESER AT THIS TIME 738 B.C ARAMAEAN REVOLTS ON THE BORDERS OF ELAM WERE SUPPRESSED BY ASSYRIAN GOVERNORS AND LARGE NUMBERS OF THE INHABITANTS WERE TRANSPORTED TO VARIOUS PLACES IN SYRIA
THIS IS MADE EVIDENT BY THE INSCRIPTIONS WHICH RECORD THE SOCIAL REFORMS OF URUKAGINA THE ILL-FATED PATESI OF LAGASH
AFTER SUFFERING THIS DISASTER SHE DIED OR ABDICATED THE THRONE IN FAVOUR OF HER SON NINYAS
HE WAS DEPOSED BY THE PRIESTS
IT IS BY CALCULATING THE PERIOD OCCUPIED BY THIS WORLD-CURVE THAT THE DATE 2084 B.C
THE EARLIEST KASSITES A PEOPLE OF UNCERTAIN RACIAL AFFINITIES BEGAN TO SETTLE IN THE LAND DURING HAMMURABI'S LIFETIME
THE FIELDS OR GARDENS MIGHT BE WORKED DURING HER LIFETIME BY HER BROTHERS IF THEY PAID RENT OR SHE MIGHT EMPLOY A MANAGER ON THE SHARE SYSTEM VESTAL VIRGINS AND MARRIED WOMEN WERE PROTECTED AGAINST THE SLANDERER

306 IN YMER'S FLESH THE EARTH THE DWARFS WERE ENGENDERED AND BEGAN TO MOVE AND LIVE
KADASHMAN-KHARBE'S IMMEDIATE SUCCESSORS RECOGNIZED IN ASSYRIA A DANGEROUS AND UNSCRUPULOUS RIVAL AND RESUMED THE STRUGGLE FOR THE POSSESSION OF MESOPOTAMIA
THE GODS AFTERWARDS RECOVER THE STOLEN SOMA
AS THE SERPENT COMING FROM THE CREVICES OF THE EARTH SHOWS THE POSSESSION OF THE TREE OR PILLAR FROM THE UNDERWORLD SO THE DOVE WITH WHICH THIS GODDESS IS ALSO ASSOCIATED SHOWS ITS POSSESSION FROM THE WORLD OF THE SKY".[485 PROFESSOR ROBERTSON SMITH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DOVE WAS OF GREAT SANCTITY AMONG THE SEMITES.[486 IT FIGURES IN HITTITE SCULPTURES AND WAS PROBABLY CONNECTED WITH THE GODDESS CULT IN ASIA MINOR
AT ANY RATE UMMA REMEMBERING THE OPPRESSIONS OF OTHER DAYS WAS NOT SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE IRON HAND OF LAGASH HAD BECOME UNNERVED
HE DIED TOWARDS THE END OF OCTOBER AND THE EARLY INCIDENTS OF HIS CAMPAIGN WERE INCLUDED IN THE RECORDS OF ASHUR-BANI-PAL'S REIGN
ON THE TOPMOST TOWER THERE IS A SPACIOUS TEMPLE AND INSIDE THE TEMPLE STANDS A COUCH OF UNUSUAL SIZE RICHLY ADORNED WITH A GOLDEN TABLE BY ITS SIDE
AS THE SON OF EA HE ACTED AS THE MESSENGER BETWEEN MERODACH AND THE GOD OF THE DEEP

WE MUST RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THE HUMAN MIND HAS EVER SHOWN A TENDENCY TO ARRIVE QUITE INDEPENDENTLY AT SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS WHEN CONFRONTED BY SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD
APPARENTLY THERE HAD BEEN A CITY REVOLT WHICH MAY HAVE GIVEN THE ENEMIES OF LAGASH THE DESIRED OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER STRENGTH FOR THE COMING CONFLICT
AS THE BULL HOWEVER HE WAS LIKE ANSHAR THE RULING ANIMAL OF THE HEAVENS
THE GIANT WARNED HIM OF THE DANGERS WHICH HE WOULD ENCOUNTER SAYING THAT THE MOUNTAIN PASSAGE WAS TWELVE MILES LONG AND BEAMLESS AND BLACK
NO DOUBT NUMEROUS ALIEN MERCHANTS WERE ATTRACTED TO ITS CITIES AND IT MAY BE THAT THEY INDUCED OR ENCOURAGED SEMITIC AND OTHER RAIDERS TO OVERTHROW GOVERNMENTS AND FORM MILITARY ARISTOCRACIES SO THAT THEY THEMSELVES MIGHT OBTAIN NECESSARY CONCESSIONS AND ACHIEVE A DEGREE OF POLITICAL ASCENDANCY
DURING THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF HIS SUCCESSOR ASHURNIRARI IV 753-746 B.C THE ARMY NEVER LEFT ASSYRIA
