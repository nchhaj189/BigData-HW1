THE JEALOUSY OF THE CHURCH APPEARED IN ANOTHER INSTANCE LESS TRAGICAL
THE SUMMONS TO SURRENDER ALLOWED TWO HOURS FOR AN ANSWER
THE COMMONS WERE SENSIBLE THAT MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT WHICH DURING SO MANY AGES HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ENGLAND WOULD SOON REGAIN SOME DEGREE OF ITS FORMER DIGNITY AFTER THE PRESENT TEMPEST WAS OVERBLOWN

SOME OF THE PICTURES INTRODUCED BY HIM WERE ALSO FOUND UPON INQUIRY TO BE THE VERY SAME THAT MIGHT BE MET WITH IN THE MASS-BOOK
THEIR NAMES WERE THE EARLS OF DENBIGH MULGRAVE PEMBROKE SALISBURY LORDS GREY AND FAIRFAX LISLE ROLLES ST JOHN WILDE BRADSHAW CROMWELL SKIPPON PICKERING MASSAM HASELRIG HARRINGTON VANE JUN DANVERS ARMINE MILDMAY CONSTABLE PENNINGTON WILSON WHITLOCKE MARTIN LUDLOW STAPLETON HEVINGHAM WALLOP HUTCHINSON BOND POPHAM VALENTINE WALTON SCOTT PUREFOY JONES
GRIEVANCES WHICH HAD BEEN FULLY REDRESSED
AND THE MORE THE ANCIENT TENOR OF THE LAWS INCULCATED A RESPECTFUL SUBORDINATION TO THE CROWN THE MORE CAREFUL WERE THEY BY THEIR LOFTY PRETENSIONS TO COVER THAT DEFECT UNDER WHICH THEY LABORED
91 93
SIR PHELIM RECOMMENDED BY THE GREATNESS OF HIS FAMILY AND PERHAPS TOO BY THE UNRESTRAINED BRUTALITY OF HIS NATURE THOUGH WITHOUT ANY COURAGE OR CAPACITY ACQUIRED THE ENTIRE ASCENDENT OVER THE NORTHERN REBELS THE ENGLISH COLONIES WERE TOTALLY ANNIHILATED IN THE OPEN COUNTRY OF ULSTER
AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
511
A MEMORABLE PERSONAGE MUCH CELEBRATED FOR HIS VIGILANCE INDUSTRY CAPACITY EVEN FOR THE STRICT EXECUTION OF JUSTICE IN THAT UNLIMITED COMMAND WHICH HE POSSESSED IN IRELAND
THE FELLOW THREATENED TO COMPLAIN TO HIS MASTER
AND HE FOUND THAT VERY LITTLE POLICY WAS REQUISITE TO FOMENT QUARRELS AMONG THEOLOGIANS
BUT BY THE PREDOMINANCY OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES THESE SALUTARY PRINCIPLES LOST THEIR CREDIT AND WERE REGARDED AS MERE HUMAN INVENTIONS YEA MORAL INSTITUTIONS FITTER FOR HEATHENS THAN FOR CHRISTIANS THE SAINT RESIGNED OVER TO SUPERIOR GUIDANCE WAS AT FULL LIBERTY TO GRATIFY ALL HIS APPETITES DISGUISED UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF PIOUS ZEAL
THOUGH AFTERWARDS PERSECUTED BY THE PARLIAMENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE PART WHICH HE HAD IN REBUILDING ST PAUL'S AND FOR OBEYING SOME ORDERS OF COUNCIL BY WHICH HE WAS DIRECTED TO PULL DOWN HOUSES IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR THAT EDIFICE
HIS OTHER DAUGHTERS WERE NO LESS PREJUDICED IN FAVOR OF THE ROYAL CAUSE AND REGRETTED THE VIOLENCES AND INIQUITIES INTO WHICH THEY THOUGHT THEIR FAMILY HAD SO UNHAPPILY BEEN TRANSPORTED
BUT NOW CHRIST IS IN GLORY AMONGST US AND IMPARTS A FURTHER MEASURE OF HIS SPIRIT TO HIS SAINTS THAN THIS CAN AFFORD
THE DUKE OF YORK WHO HAD WITH APPLAUSE SERVED SOME CAMPAIGNS IN THE FRENCH ARMY AND WHO HAD MERITED THE PARTICULAR ESTEEM OF MARSHAL TURENNE NOW JOINED HIS BROTHER AND CONTINUED TO SEEK MILITARY EXPERIENCE UNDER DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA AND THE PRINCE OF CONDE
THE WEAKNESS OF THE COURT ALSO COULD NOT MORE EVIDENTLY APPEAR THAN BY ITS BEING REDUCED TO USE SO INEFFECTUAL AN EXPEDIENT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN INFLUENCE OVER THE COMMONS
IT CONSISTED OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE PERSONS AS NAMED BY THE COMMONS
IT WAS REPLIED BY STRAFFORD AND HIS FRIENDS THAT OLD VANE WAS HIS MOST INVETERATE AND DECLARED ENEMY
AND HIS WHOLE ARMY PUSHED OFF THE FIELD OF BATTLE RUSH
THESE WERE THE TOPICS WHICH WITH SO MUCH JUSTNESS OF REASONING AND PROPRIETY OF EXPRESSION WERE INSISTED ON IN THE KING'S DECLARATIONS AND REMONSTRANCES 11 RUSH
CROMWELL SENT A GUARD WHO SEIZED ALL THE CRIMINALS
NOR IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THE KING WHOSE CAPACITY WAS NOT EQUAL TO SITUATIONS OF SUCH EXTREME DELICACY SHOULD HASTILY HAVE FORMED AND EXECUTED THE RESOLUTION OF DISSOLVING THIS PARLIAMENT
A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING
CHRISTMAS AS IT IS KEPT IS THE DEVIL'S CHRISTMAS
IN THE FORMER CAMPAIGN MARDYKE WAS TAKEN AND PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENGLISH
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN THEIR REASONINGS DISCOVER JUDGMENT KNOWLEDGE ELOCUTION
THE POPULACE OF LONDON WERE ENRAGED AND WOULD HAVE INSULTED THE DUTCH AMBASSADORS WHO LIVED AT CHELSEA HAD NOT THE COUNCIL OF STATE SENT GUARDS TO PROTECT THEM
AS HE WAS NOW FULLY KNOWN TO BE OF THE ROYAL PARTY HE NO LONGER CONCEALED HIS PRINCIPLES
THIS NOBLEMAN HAD CAUSE TO BE EXTREMELY DEVOTED TO THE KING NOT ONLY BY REASON OF THE CONNECTION OF BLOOD WHICH UNITED HIM TO THE ROYAL FAMILY BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT CONFIDENCE AND FAVOR WITH WHICH HE HAD EVER BEEN HONORED BY HIS MASTER
BUT THIS WAS THE FAVORABLE TIME FOR EXTENDING PRIVILEGES
SIR ARTHUR ASTON THE GOVERNOR BEING WOUNDED COLONEL FIELDING SUCCEEDED TO THE COMMAND
IN EVERY TREATY THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE THOUGHT HE COULD NOT IN CONSCIENCE MAINTAIN HE NEVER COULD BY ANY MOTIVE OR PERSUASION BE INDUCED TO MAKE
AFTER THIS VICTORY NEWCASTLE WITH AN ARMY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN SAT DOWN BEFORE HULL
AND HAVE CONTRACTED NO DOUBT SOME PREJUDICES AGAINST POPULAR PRIVILEGES WHICH IN THEIR APPREHENSION HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF SO MUCH DISORDER
LAUD OBTAINED THE BISHOPRIC OF LONDON FOR HIS FRIEND JUXON
THESE MOTIVES OF INTEREST ACQUIRED ADDITIONAL INFLUENCE AND BECAME MORE DANGEROUS TO THE PARLIAMENT FROM THE RELIGIOUS SPIRIT BY WHICH THE ARMY WAS UNIVERSALLY ACTUATED
NOT CONTENT WITH EXPELLING THE ENGLISH THEIR HOUSES WITH DESPOILING THEM OF THEIR GOODLY MANORS WITH WASTING THEIR CULTIVATED FIELDS THEY STRIPPED THEM OF THEIR VERY CLOTHES AND TURNED THEM OUT NAKED AND DEFENCELESS TO ALL THE SEVERITIES OF THE SEASON THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES AS IF CONSPIRING AGAINST THAT UNHAPPY PEOPLE WERE ARMED WITH COLD AND TEMPEST UNUSUAL TO THE CLIMATE AND EXECUTED WHAT THE MERCILESS SWORD HAD LEFT UNFINISHED THE ROADS WERE COVERED WITH CROWDS OF NAKED ENGLISH HASTENING TOWARDS DUBLIN AND THE OTHER CITIES WHICH YET REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN
CROMWELL BURST OUT A LAUGHING
BUT BEFORE THAT TIME EXPIRED THERE APPEARED BEFORE THE KING TWO CITIZENS WITH LEAN PALE SHARP AND DISMAL VISAGES
SOME OF HIS RETAINERS HAVING TOLD HIM OF A PROPHECY THAT TO HIM AND HIM ALONE IT WAS RESERVED TO RESTORE THE KING'S AUTHORITY IN ALL HIS DOMINIONS HE LENT A WILLING EAR TO SUGGESTIONS WHICH HOWEVER ILL GROUNDED OR IMPROBABLE WERE SO CONFORMABLE TO HIS OWN DARING CHARACTER
AND THE ARTS OF ELUDING THE ENEMY HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY PRACTISED
IRETON CROMWELL'S SON-IN-LAW IN THE LEFT
THE IDEA HOWEVER OF A PERFECT AND IMMORTAL COMMONWEALTH WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND AS CHIMERICAL AS THAT OF A PERFECT AND IMMORTAL MAN
AND YORK WAS NOW CLOSELY BESIEGED BY THEIR COMBINED FORCES
787
THREE PARTIES AT THAT TIME PREVAILED IN SCOTLAND
WHEN THESE VESSELS BY CHARLES'S ORDERS ARRIVED AT DIEPPE THERE AROSE A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THEY WERE TO SERVE AGAINST ROCHELLE
FROM HIM WERE ALL MAGISTRACY AND HONORS DERIVED
BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED
AND NO MEASURE SURELY COULD BE PROJECTED MORE GENERALLY ODIOUS TO THE WHOLE NATION
FACES SO STRANGE AND UNCOUTH ACCORDING TO CLARENDON FIGURES SO HABITED AND ACCOUTRED AS AT ONCE MOVED THE MOST SEVERE COUNTENANCE TO MIRTH AND THE MOST CHEERFUL HEART TO SADNESS
NEW THINGS
HE HAD ENGAGED THE PARLIAMENT OF IRELAND TO ADVANCE LARGE SUBSIDIES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A WAR AGAINST THEM
BY THEMSELVES OR THEIR EMISSARIES THEY REPRESENTED TO THE SOLDIERS THAT ALL THOSE BRAVE ACTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN PERFORMED DURING THE WAR AND WHICH WERE SO MERITORIOUS IN THE EYES OF THE PARLIAMENT WOULD NO DOUBT BE REGARDED AS THE DEEPEST CRIMES BY THE ROYALISTS AND WOULD EXPOSE THE ARMY TO THE SEVEREST VENGEANCE
SIR ARTHUR HAZELRIG PROPOSED THE IMPEACHMENT OF LAMBERT FOR HIGH TREASON
IN ALL QUESTIONS INDEED OF ELECTIONS NO STEADY RULE OF DECISION WAS OBSERVED
127
POUDRAM CASTLE BEING TAKEN BY HIM AND EXETER BLOCKADED ON ALL SIDES HOPTON A MAN OF MERIT WHO NOW COMMANDED THE ROYALISTS HAVING ADVANCED TO THE RELIEF OF THAT TOWN WITH AN ARMY OF EIGHT THOUSAND MEN MET WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY AT TORRINGTON WHERE HE WAS DEFEATED ALL HIS FOOT DISPERSED AND HE HIMSELF WITH HIS HORSE OBLIGED TO RETIRE INTO CORNWALL
FROM WHAT QUARTER CAN JEALOUSIES NOW ARISE
THE KING STILL PERSEVERED IN HIS ENDEAVORS TO ELUDE THE PETITION
THIS WINTER THE FAMOUS PYM DIED
ONE MARRIED TO GENERAL FLEETWOOD ANOTHER TO LORD FAUCONBERG A THIRD TO LORD RICH
BUT ON THE APPROACHES TOWARDS A CIVIL WAR WHICH WAS NOT THEN FORESEEN IT HAD BEEN OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE TO THE KING TO HAVE RESERVED THE RIGHT OF DISSOLUTION AND TO HAVE ENDURED ANY EXTREMITY RATHER THAN ALLOW THE CONTINUANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT FOOTNOTE 8
612
WHERE THE TWO OFFICERS LAST MENTIONED GAINED RENOWN BY THEIR CONDUCT AND GALLANTRY
CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR AND COMPLAINED TO THE PARLIAMENT OF HIS DISOBEDIENCE
THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS
THE SCOTTISH AND PARLIAMENTARY GENERALS RAISED THE SIEGE AND DRAWING UP ON MARSTON MOOR PURPOSED TO GIVE BATTLE TO THE ROYALISTS
AND IF THE KING RETIRED INTO THAT CITY TO LAY SIEGE TO IT AND BY ONE ENTERPRISE PUT A PERIOD TO THE WAR
LEST HABIT SHOULD BEGET NEW CONNECTIONS AND DEPRESS THE SUBLIMITY OF HIS AERIAL MEDITATIONS
BUT HAVING QUARRELLED FIRST WITH BUCKINGHAM THEN WITH LAUD HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE COUNTRY PARTY
WILMOT SEIZING THE ENEMY'S CANNON AND HAVING JOINED HIS FRIENDS WHOM HE CAME TO RELIEVE ATTACKED WALLER'S INFANTRY WITH REDOUBLED COURAGE DROVE THEM OFF THE FIELD AND ROUTED AND DISPERSED THE WHOLE ARMY RUSH
CROMWELL THEREUPON SAID MORE THAN ONCE THAT IF THE KING HAD FOLLOWED HIS OWN JUDGMENT AND HAD BEEN ATTENDED BY NONE BUT TRUSTY SERVANTS HE HAD FOOLED THEM ALL
THAT THE PURITANICAL PARLIAMENT HAVING AT LENGTH SUBDUED THEIR SOVEREIGN WOULD NO DOUBT AS SOON AS THEY HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR AUTHORITY EXTEND THEIR AMBITIOUS ENTERPRISES TO IRELAND AND MAKE THE CATHOLICS IN THAT KINGDOM FEEL THE SAME FURIOUS PERSECUTION TO WHICH THEIR BRETHREN IN ENGLAND WERE AT PRESENT EXPOSED
AND IN A FIT OF ROMANTIC GENEROSITY OVERTURN WHAT WITH SO MUCH EXPENSE OF BLOOD AND TREASURE THEY HAD DURING THE COURSE OF SO MANY YEARS BEEN SO CAREFULLY ERECTING
SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A HIGH REGARD FOR DR HUET LATELY EXECUTED
906
IN THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THE MEETINGS OF PARLIAMENT WERE PRECARIOUS AND WERE NOT FREQUENT
BY THE FAMOUS ACT OF SUBMISSION TO THAT PRINCE THE CLERGY BOUND THEMSELVES TO ENACT NO CANONS WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT
AND THAT IF HE HAD HITHERTO LEVIED TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE HE PRETENDED TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF ONLY BY THE NECESSITY OF SO DOING NOT BY ANY RIGHT WHICH HE ASSUMED RUSHWORTH VOL
BUT CONFINEMENT THOUGH A LESS STRIKING IS NO LESS SEVERE A PUNISHMENT
BUT WHEN PREACHERS FORSAKE THEIR OWN CALLING AND TURN IGNORANT STATESMEN WE SEE HOW WILLING THEY ARE TO EXCHANGE A GOOD CONSCIENCE FOR A BISHOPRIC
THERE ARE AT PRESENT NEAR EIGHT HUNDRED
SINCERE IN HIS PROFESSIONS DISINTERESTED IN HIS VIEWS OPEN IN HIS CONDUCT HE HAD FORMED ONE OF THE MOST SHINING CHARACTERS OF THE AGE HAD NOT THE EXTREME NARROWNESS OF HIS GENIUS IN EVERY THING BUT IN WAR AND HIS EMBARRASSED AND CONFUSED ELOCUTION ON EVERY OCCASION BUT WHEN HE GAVE ORDERS DIMINISHED THE LUSTRE OF HIS MERIT AND RENDERED THE PART WHICH HE ACTED EVEN WHEN VESTED WITH THE SUPREME COMMAND BUT SECONDARY AND SUBORDINATE
BUT THE REASONS PROCEEDING FROM BIGOTRY WERE NOT SUSPECTED BY JAMES AND WERE AT LAST OVERCOME THEY BECAME SINCERE
IN THE NORTH DURING THIS SUMMER THE GREAT INTEREST AND POPULARITY OF THE EARL NOW CREATED MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE HAD RAISED A CONSIDERABLE FORCE FOR THE KING
HE OBSERVED TO THEM THAT BY THE REBELLION OF THE SCOTS AND FACTIONS OF THE ENGLISH THE KING'S AUTHORITY IN BRITAIN WAS REDUCED TO SO LOW A CONDITION THAT HE NEVER COULD EXERT HIMSELF WITH ANY VIGOR IN MAINTAINING THE ENGLISH DOMINION OVER IRELAND
AND HE WAS CAREFUL NEVER BY ANY LIBERTIES TO GIVE OFFENCE TO THE MOST RIGID OF THE GODLY
THE SPEECHES OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ORATORS DURING THIS PERIOD ARE OF A STRAIN MUCH SUPERIOR TO WHAT ANY FORMER AGE HAD PRODUCED IN ENGLAND
BUT BY THIS EXTRAORDINARY AND UNEXPECTED SUCCESS OF HIS ALLY CHARLES FAILED OF THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH HE FRAMED THE ALLIANCE
THERE ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF THE HIGH RESPECT PAID TO THE NOBILITY AND TO THE GREAT IN THAT AGE WHEN THE POWERS OF MONARCHY THOUGH DISPUTED STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES IN THEIR PRISTINE VIGOR
THEY VOTED AN ADDRESS FOR A TREATY
BAILLIE AND URREY NOW DIVIDED THEIR TROOPS IN ORDER THE BETTER TO CONDUCT THE WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY WHO SURPRISED THEM AS MUCH BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS MARCHES AS BY THE BOLDNESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES
MANY OF THE ROYALISTS FLATTERED THEMSELVES THAT THE SAME VIGOROUS SPIRIT WHICH HAD ELEVATED THEM TO THE PRESENT HEIGHT OF POWER WOULD STILL FAVOR THEIR PROGRESS AND OBTAIN THEM A FINAL VICTORY OVER THEIR ENEMIES
1-734-BLAKE.JPG ADMIRAL BLAKE THE AMBASSADORS WHOM THE DUTCH HAD SENT OVER TO ENGLAND GAVE THEM HOPES OF PEACE
AND THE CARNAL SELF-SEEKING OF SOME TOGETHER WITH THE NEGLECT OF FAMILY PRAYERS BY OTHERS
THE TROOPS WERE NOT FURNISHED WITH ARMS FIT FOR SUCH AN EXPEDITION
IN THE WEST ESPECIALLY WHERE GORING COMMANDED UNIVERSAL SPOIL AND HAVOC WERE COMMITTED
BUT THE TITLE OF THE SUBJECT TO PERSONAL LIBERTY NOT ONLY IS FOUNDED ON ANCIENT AND THEREFORE THE MOST SACRED LAWS
AND THE FUNERAL OF THE PARLIAMENT THE POPULACE EXCLAIMED WAS CELEBRATED BY THESE SYMBOLS OF HATRED AND DERISION
AN ACTION WAS NOW UNAVOIDABLE
AND THEN THE PARLIAMENT PRETENDED TO A COMPLETE VICTORY THE KING ALSO ON HIS PART WAS NOT WANTING TO DISPLAY HIS ADVANTAGES
THOUGH THE KING BELIEVED THAT HIS PREROGATIVE ENTITLED HIM TO A POWER IN GENERAL OF DIRECTING WHATEVER BELONGED TO THE EXTERIOR GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH THIS WAS DEEMED A MATTER OF TOO GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BE ORDERED WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF A PARTICULAR STATUTE
HAD THEY PROCEEDED WITH MODERATION AND BEEN CONTENTED IN THEIR PRESENT PLENITUDE OF POWER TO REMOVE SUCH PARTS ONLY AS MIGHT JUSTLY BE DEEMED SUPERFLUOUS AND INCONGRUOUS
HE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THE SPANIARDS SINCERE IN THEIR PROFESSIONS
ON THE OTHER HAND CHARLES CONSIDERED THAT SCOTLAND WAS NEVER BEFORE UNDER ANY OF HIS ANCESTORS SO UNITED AND SO ANIMATED IN ITS OWN DEFENCE
AND DO YOU THINK THAT THE MEAN SPIRITS OF SUCH BASE AND LOW FELLOWS AS OURS WILL EVER BE ABLE TO ENCOUNTER GENTLEMEN THAT HAVE HONOR AND COURAGE AND RESOLUTION IN THEM
BY REDUCING THE CROWN TO NECESSITIES THEY HAD HITHERTO FOUND THAT THE KING HAD BEEN PUSHED INTO VIOLENT COUNSELS WHICH HAD SERVED EXTREMELY THE PURPOSES OF HIS ADVERSARIES
AND FOR WANT OF LEADERS THE SOLDIERS WERE AT LAST WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
BUT THOSE WHO WERE WILLING TO RETAIN BISHOPS INSISTED ON REDUCING THEIR AUTHORITY TO A LOW EBB AS WELL AS ON ABOLISHING THE CEREMONIES OF WORSHIP AND VESTMENTS OF THE CLERGY
SOMETIMES THEY WERE THROWN INTO MAD-HOUSES SOMETIMES INTO PRISONS
BUT FAIRFAX THOUGH HE HAD ALLOWED THE ARMY TO MAKE USE OF HIS NAME IN MURDERING THEIR SOVEREIGN AND OFFERING VIOLENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT HAD ENTERTAINED UNSURMOUNTABLE SCRUPLES AGAINST INVADING THE SCOTS WHOM HE CONSIDERED AS ZEALOUS PRESBYTERIANS AND UNITED TO ENGLAND BY THE SACRED BANDS OF THE COVENANT
OTHERS RETIRED INTO PLACES OF SECURITY AND PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR DEFENCE
THE ENTRANCE INTO THE TOWN WAS STILL MORE DIFFICULT
AND WAS MORE FITTED TO RULE IN A REGULAR ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT THAN EITHER TO GIVE WAY TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF A POPULAR ASSEMBLY OR FINALLY TO SUBDUE THEIR PRETENSIONS
ONE STROKE WILL MAKE MY WIFE A WIDOW MY DEAR CHILDREN FATHERLESS DEPRIVE MY POOR SERVANTS OF THEIR INDULGENT MASTER AND SEPARATE ME FROM MY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER AND ALL MY FRIENDS
BY PROMOTING ALL MEASURES WHICH REDUCED THE POWERS OF THE CROWN THEY HOPED TO DISARM THE KING WHOM THEY JUSTLY REGARDED FROM PRINCIPLE INCLINATION AND POLICY TO BE THE DETERMINED PATRON OF THE HIERARCHY
SENSIBLE OF THIS UNHAPPY MEASURE THE KING HAD OF HIMSELF RECALLED DURING THE TIME OF HIS FIRST EXPEDITION AGAINST SCOTLAND MANY OF THESE OPPRESSIVE PATENTS
IN EVERY DISCOURSE OR CONVERSATION THIS MODE OF RELIGION ENTERED
AND HE WOULD SOMETIMES PUSH THEM BY AN INDULGENCE IN WINE TO OPEN TO HIM THE MOST SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR BOSOM
AND OBSERVED THAT AN UNJUST SENTENCE WHICH HE HAD SUFFERED TO TAKE EFFECT WAS NOW PUNISHED BY AN UNJUST SENTENCE UPON HIMSELF
THE DOMINION WHICH ENGLAND CLAIMED OVER IRELAND DEMANDED MORE IMMEDIATELY THEIR EFFORTS FOR SUBDUING THAT COUNTRY
WHILE PRIVATE RESENTMENT WAS BOILING IN HIS SULLEN UNSOCIABLE MIND HE HEARD THE NATION RESOUND WITH COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DUKE
THE GENIUS OF RELIGION WHICH PREVAILED IN THE COURT AND AMONG THE PRELATES WAS OF AN OPPOSITE NATURE
IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS UNIVERSAL COMPLAINTS PREVAILED AS IF THE KINGDOM WERE REDUCED TO SLAVERY
THE EASTERN POETICAL STYLE OF THAT COMPOSITION MADE IT MORE EASILY SUSCEPTIBLE OF A TURN WHICH WAS AGREEABLE TO THEM
AND INFLAMED WITH A ZEALOUS CONCERN FOR THE ECCLESIASTICAL DISCIPLINE OF THE PRESBYTERIANS
THE INTENDED HUMILIATION OR PENANCE OF THE KING WAS CHANGED INTO THE CEREMONY OF HIS CORONATION WHICH WAS PERFORMED AT SCONE WITH GREAT POMP AND SOLEMNITY
HE EXPECTED EVERY DAY THAT THEY WOULD PRESENT HIM AN ADDRESS FOR MAKING PEACE WITH THOSE REBELS
THIS PRINCIPLE WHICH PREVAILS SO MUCH AMONG ZEALOTS NEVER DISPLAYED ITSELF SO OPENLY AS DURING THE TRANSACTIONS OF THIS WHOLE PERIOD
NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY
THE PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY ABHORRED THE CONVOCATION AS MUCH AS THEY REVERED THE PARLIAMENT COULD SCARCELY BE RESTRAINED FROM INSULTING AND ABUSING THIS ASSEMBLY
CROMWELL IRETON HARRISON AND THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE ARMY MOST OF THEM OF MEAN BIRTH WERE MEMBERS TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE LOWER HOUSE AND SOME CITIZENS OF LONDON
THE DUTCH EMPLOYED THEIR GOOD OFFICES
THESE VIOLENT DISSENSIONS BROUGHT MATTERS TO EXTREMITY AND PUSHED THE INDEPENDENTS TO THE EXECUTION OF THEIR DESIGNS
AND TOGETHER WITH ANOTHER FINE OF FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS CONDEMNED TO LOSE WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS
AND HIS ARMY WAS REDUCED TO DIFFICULTIES
THAT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED SO MUCH AS TO REPRESENT THEIR GRIEVANCES
THE WRITS LIKEWISE ALLOW SEVERAL MONTHS FOR EQUIPPING THE SHIPS
AND ON ACCOUNT OF THESE CLAIMS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN WAS THE WAR RENEWED
THE PROTECTOR MIGHT BETTER HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE FEARS AND APPREHENSIONS WHICH THE PUBLIC DISTEMPERS OCCASIONED HAD HE ENJOYED ANY DOMESTIC SATISFACTION OR POSSESSED ANY CORDIAL FRIEND OF HIS OWN FAMILY IN WHOSE BOSOM HE COULD SAFELY HAVE UNLOADED HIS ANXIOUS AND CORRODING CARES
AND A COMMITTEE OF BOTH HOUSES--A THING UNPRECEDENTED--WAS APPOINTED TO SIT DURING THE RECESS WITH VERY AMPLE POWERS PYM WAS ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE LOWER HOUSE
BUT HE WAS APT IN IMITATION OF HIS FATHER TO IMAGINE THAT THE PARLIAMENT WHEN THEY FAILED OF SUPPLYING HIS NECESSITIES HAD ON THEIR PART FREED HIM FROM THE OBLIGATION OF A STRICT PERFORMANCE
URGED BY HIS WANTS AND HIS PIETY HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH HAMBDEN HIS NEAR KINSMAN WHO WAS PRESSED ONLY BY THE LATTER MOTIVE TO TRANSPORT HIMSELF INTO NEW ENGLAND NOW BECOME THE RETREAT OF THE MORE ZEALOUS AMONG THE PURITANICAL PARTY
THOUGH I AM NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION
IT APPEARS THAT THE IRISH REBELS OBSERVING SOME INCONSISTENCE IN THEIR FIRST FORGERY WERE OBLIGED TO FORGE THIS COMMISSION ANEW YET COULD NOT RENDER IT COHERENT OR PROBABLE
AND THEIR LAW THEY RESOLVED TO CALL A PETITION OF RIGHT
THE PARLIAMENT WHICH SAT AFTER THE ASSEMBLY ADVANCED PRETENSIONS WHICH TENDED TO DIMINISH THE CIVIL POWER OF THE MONARCH
THE COMMONS AGREED TO THE NECESSITY OF PROTECTING THE QUEEN MOTHER
A FURIOUS BATTLE COMMENCED WHERE THE ADMIRALS ON BOTH SIDES AS WELL AS THE INFERIOR OFFICERS AND SEAMEN EXERTED GREAT BRAVERY
116 SEE FURTHER VOL
TO THE ROYALISTS THIS MEASURE WAS EQUALLY UNEXPECTED
AND THE REPORT OF HIS DEATH BEING GENERALLY BELIEVED HAPPILY RELAXED THE VIGILANT SEARCH OF HIS ENEMIES
IN PROPORTION TO THE ENORMITY OF THE VIOLENCES AND USURPATIONS WERE AUGMENTED THE PRETENCES OF SANCTITY AMONG THOSE REGICIDES
AND BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WARS IT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CONTAINED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND SOULS FOR A LIKE REASON THE CATHOLICS AFTERWARDS WHO FOUND THEMSELVES EXPOSED TO MANY HARDSHIPS AND DREADED STILL WORSE TREATMENT WENT OVER TO AMERICA IN GREAT NUMBERS AND SETTLED THE COLONY OF MARYLAND
AN APOLOGY WAS MADE BY THE ROYALISTS AS IF THESE WERE A RETALIATION FOR SOME VIOLENCES COMMITTED ON THEIR FRIENDS AT THE SURRENDER OF READING
THE ELDEST WAS AT THAT TIME A PRISONER WITH THE ENEMY
WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS WHICH NEITHER THE ONE PARTY APPREHENDED NOR THE OTHER EXPECTED HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS
THOUGH HIS MAJESTY HAS SHOWN BY FREQUENT MEETINGS WITH HIS PEOPLE HIS LOVE TO THE USE OF PARLIAMENTS
BUT THE OTHER REPLIED CARELESSLY THAT HE DID NOT TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT THAT GOOSE
THE PARLIAMENT RENEWED THEIR APPLICATIONS TO HIM AND PRESENTED HIM WITH THE SAME CONDITIONS WHICH THEY HAD OFFERED AT NEWCASTLE
1181
THE ROYALISTS NEXT ATTEMPTED TO MARCH EASTWARDS AND TO JOIN THEIR FORCES TO THE KING'S AT OXFORD
APPLICATION WAS MADE TO THE KING THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THIS COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE PRIVY COUNSELLORS WITH REGARD TO OPINIONS DELIVERED AT THE BOARD
610
WERE ATTENDED BY A MIGHTY CONFLUENCE OF COMPANY THEIR CHARGES WERE BORNE WITH GREAT MAGNIFICENCE AND LIBERAL PRESENTS BESTOWED ON THEM
70 71 72
CANT AND HYPOCRISY ALONE ENCOURAGED
CHARLES SENSIBLE THAT AN EXTORTED CONSENT ATTENDED WITH SUCH INVIDIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD RATHER BE PREJUDICIAL TO HIS MEASURES HAD WHOLLY LAID ASIDE THE USE OF ASSEMBLIES AND WAS RESOLVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BISHOPS TO GOVERN THE CHURCH BY AN AUTHORITY TO WHICH HE THOUGHT HIMSELF FULLY ENTITLED AND WHICH HE BELIEVED INHERENT IN THE CROWN
AND THOUGH HE ABANDONED HIS BEST FRIEND YET WAS HE STILL ABLE TO PRESERVE IN SOME DEGREE THE ATTACHMENT OF ALL HIS ADHERENTS
IN REALITY IT WAS EASY FOR THE KING TO PERCEIVE BY THE NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN TRIFLES AND IMPORTANT MATTERS AND BY THE CONNECTION MAINTAINED AT THAT TIME BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS THAT WHEN HE WAS CONTENDING FOR THE SURPLICE HE WAS IN EFFECT FIGHTING FOR HIS CROWN AND EVEN FOR HIS HEAD
AND THE KING AS HE HAS ALREADY LOST THE POWER WILL LAY ASIDE THE WILL OF INVADING THE CONSTITUTION
SO VIOLENT WAS THE GENERAL PROPENSITY TOWARDS THIS NEW RELIGION THAT MULTITUDES OF ALL RANKS CROWDED TO THE CHURCH
THE KING'S ARMY BY BRINGING OFF THEIR CANNON FROM DENNINGTON CASTLE IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY SEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENTLY REPAIRED THE HONOR WHICH THEY HAD LOST AT NEWBURY
IN THIS ACTION THE DUTCH HAD THE ADVANTAGE
I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
HARDLY WERE THERE MEN ENOUGH TO RECEIVE IT OR ROOM SUFFICIENT TO STOW IT
AFTER THE MOST DILIGENT INQUIRY PROMPTED BY THE GREATEST MALICE THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM
WHERE NO DISTURBANCE CAN HAVE PLACE AT ONE BLOW WAS HIS HEAD SEVERED FROM HIS BODY
FOR THEY HAD RECEIVED LITTLE REGULAR PAY SINCE THEY HAD ENTERED ENGLAND
AND WERE DETERMINED NEVER TO BE SATISFIED
AND THEN SHALL WE HENCEFORTH EXPECT WITH CERTAINTY HAPPINESS IN THIS WORLD OLIVER CROMWELL AT THAT TIME A YOUNG MAN OF NO ACCOUNT IN THE NATION IS MENTIONED IN THESE DEBATES AS COMPLAINING OF ONE WHO HE WAS TOLD PREACHED FLAT POPERY IT IS AMUSING TO OBSERVE THE FIRST WORDS OF THIS FANATICAL HYPOCRITE CORRESPOND SO EXACTLY TO HIS CHARACTER
THE DREADFUL SURPLICE WAS BEFORE MEN'S EYES AND THEY APPREHENDED WITH SOME REASON THAT UNDER SANCTION OF THIS LAW IT WOULD SOON BE INTRODUCED AMONG THEM
BUT AS HE HAD A BETTER OPINION OF GLAMORGAN'S ZEAL AND AFFECTION FOR HIS SERVICE THAN OF HIS CAPACITY HE ENJOINED HIM TO COMMUNICATE ALL HIS MEASURES TO ORMOND
36 CLARENDON VOL
AND THAT IN CIVIL AFFAIRS HE SHOULD ENTIRELY CONFORM HIMSELF TO THE DIRECTION OF PARLIAMENT AND IN ECCLESIASTICAL TO THAT OF THE ASSEMBLY
TO GREAT NUMBERS OF LOYALISTS ALL REDRESS FROM THESE SEQUESTRATIONS WAS REFUSED
AND SUCH AN EXPEDIENT WAS NEVER THOUGHT OF DURING THE AGE OF CHARLES.[**PERIOD INSERTED THE MEETINGS OF PARLIAMENT WERE TOO PRECARIOUS AND THEIR DETERMINATIONS MIGHT BE TOO DILATORY TO SERVE IN CASES OF URGENT NECESSITY
PETITIONS FROM THE MILITARY TO THE CIVIL POWER ARE ALWAYS LOOKED ON AS DISGUISED OR RATHER UNDISGUISED COMMANDS AND ARE OF A NATURE WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM PETITIONS PRESENTED BY ANY OTHER RANK OF MEN
FOR THIS INSTANCE OF COURAGE AND DEXTERITY SHE MET WITH HARSH USAGE

IT WAS INGENIOUSLY ANSWERED BY PYM THAT SUCH A DELAY MIGHT PROBABLY BLAST ALL THEIR HOPES AND PUT IT OUT OF THEIR POWER TO PROCEED ANY FURTHER IN THE PROSECUTION
THERE PRINCE RUPERT AND THE EARL OF NORTHAMPTON JOINED HIM WITH CONSIDERABLE BODIES OF CAVALRY
THAT SOME POINTS IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNDAMENTALS AND WERE NOT ON ANY PRETENCE TO BE ALTERED OR DISPUTED
THE KING CAME TO THE CAMP
BE BURIED AMONG KINGS AND WITH MORE THAN REGAL SOLEMNITY
THE BREACH BEING ALREADY MADE BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND CIVIL POWERS WHEN THE LATE KING WAS SEIZED AT HOLDENBY THE GENERAL OFFICERS REGARDED THE PARLIAMENT AS AT ONCE THEIR CREATURE AND THEIR RIVAL
349
349
BUT THE DEATH OF STAFFORD WAS TOO IMPORTANT A STROKE OF PARTY TO BE LEFT UNATTEMPTED BY ANY EXPEDIENT HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY
THERE IS A PASSAGE IN LORD CLARENDON WHERE IT IS SAID THAT THE KING ASSENTED THE MORE EASILY TO THE BILL WHICH EXCLUDED THE BISHOPS FROM THE HOUSE OF PEERS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT THAT LAW BEING ENACTED BY FORCE COULD NOT BE VALID
ARGYLE AND HAMILTON BEING SEIZED WITH AN APPREHENSION REAL OR PRETENDED THAT THE EARL OF CRAWFURD AND OTHERS MEANT TO ASSASSINATE THEM LEFT THE PARLIAMENT SUDDENLY AND RETIRED INTO THE COUNTRY
HE HAD PROMISED TO THE LAST HOUSE OF COMMONS A REDRESS OF THIS RELIGIOUS GRIEVANCE
1190 1191 1192 ETC
NO SOONER DID THIS INTELLIGENCE REACH LONDON THAN THE COMMITTEE OF THE TWO KINGDOMS VOTED THANKS TO ESSEX FOR HIS FIDELITY COURAGE AND CONDUCT
AND CROMWELL IN THE PUBLIC DEBATES REVIVED THE ACCUSATION THAT THIS NOBLEMAN HAD WILFULLY NEGLECTED AT DENNINGTON CASTLE A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR BY A TOTAL DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS
THE REST WERE ELECTED BY LONDON AND THE MORE CONSIDERABLE CORPORATIONS
THAT HE MIGHT THE BETTER CONCEAL HIS INTENTIONS ORDERS WERE GIVEN AT EVERY GATE IN OXFORD FOR ALLOWING THREE PERSONS TO PASS
CROMWELL ADVANCED TO THE SCOTCH CAMP AND ENDEAVORED BY EVERY EXPEDIENT TO BRING LESLEY TO A BATTLE
OUGHT THE AFFIRMATION OF PERFIDIOUS INFAMOUS REBELS EVER TO HAVE PASSED FOR ANY AUTHORITY
AND RUPERT AT LAST RETURNED TO FRANCE WHERE HE DISPOSED OF THE REMNANTS OF HIS FLEET TOGETHER WITH HIS PRIZES
AND THE FORMER AT THAT TIME COMMANDED A BODY OF HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO WORCESTER IN ORDER TO WATCH THE MOTIONS OF ESSEX WHO WAS MARCHING TOWARDS THAT CITY
THE PROJECT OF INTRODUCING FURTHER INNOVATIONS IN ENGLAND BEING ONCE FORMED BY THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS IT BECAME A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THAT THEIR OPERATIONS WITH REGARD TO IRELAND SHOULD ALL OF THEM BE CONSIDERED AS SUBORDINATE TO THE FORMER ON WHOSE SUCCESS WHEN ONCE UNDERTAKEN THEIR OWN GRANDEUR SECURITY AND EVEN BEING MUST ENTIRELY DEPEND
IN THIS PROPHECY IT WAS FORETOLD THAT CROMWELL SHOULD BE THE GREATEST MAN IN ENGLAND AND WOULD NEARLY BUT NEVER WOULD FULLY MOUNT THE THRONE
AT NASEBY WAS FOUGHT WITH FORCES NEARLY EQUAL THIS DECISIVE AND WELL-DISPUTED ACTION BETWEEN THE KING AND PARLIAMENT
THE EARL OF LINDESEY WHO IN HIS YOUTH HAD SOUGHT EXPERIENCE OF MILITARY SERVICE IN THE LOW COUNTRIES WAS GENERAL
P 216
THE CONTEMPT ENTERTAINED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THE KING'S PARTY WAS SO GREAT THAT IT WAS THE CHIEF CAUSE OF PUSHING MATTERS TO SUCH EXTREMITIES AGAINST HIM
HER NAME MICHELSON A WOMAN FULL OF WHIMSEYS PARTLY HYSTERICAL PARTLY RELIGIOUS
THEY AGAIN CLAIMED THE EXECUTION OF THE PENAL LAWS AGAINST CATHOLICS
SINCE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PROMPT RESIGNATION OF THE COMMAND A MUTINY WAS GENERALLY APPREHENDED RUSH
AND SO MY LORDS EVEN SO WITH ALL HUMILITY AND WITH ALL TRANQUILLITY OF MIND I SUBMIT CLEARLY AND FREELY TO YOUR JUDGMENTS
OF ALL THESE NO ONE PROVED WANTING EITHER IN HONOR OR DISCRETION
INDUSTRY AND ALL THE ARTS OF PEACE WERE INTRODUCED AMONG THAT RUDE PEOPLE
AND SOME OFFICERS HAD BEEN MURDERED MERELY ON SUSPICION OF THEIR BEING PAPISTS THE PETITION OF RIGHT HAD ABOLISHED ALL MARTIAL LAW
AND IF THE LEAST MARK OF MALIGNANCY AS IT WAS CALLED OR AFFECTION TO THE KING WHO SO ENTIRELY LOVED THEM HAD EVER ESCAPED THEIR LIPS EVEN THIS HARD CHOICE WAS NOT PERMITTED
THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM
275
275
THE LIVELY AND ANIMATED DIGBY DISPLAYED HIS ELOQUENCE ON THIS OCCASION
IT WAS VOTED THAT NO MORE ADDRESSES BE MADE TO THE KING NOR ANY LETTERS OR MESSAGES BE RECEIVED FROM HIM
THE VIGOR OF THE KING'S MIND NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEEMING DECLINE OF HIS BODY HERE APPEARED UNBROKEN AND UNDECAYED
IT CONSISTED OF THE SAME VIOLENT RENUNCIATION OF POPERY ABOVE MENTIONED
AND BY THIS BOLD AND MAGNANIMOUS BEHAVIOR HE ESCAPED THE DANGER OF AN IMMEDIATE PROSECUTION
1364
AND NEVER WAS THE TRIUMPH MORE FULL AND COMPLETE
AFTER BUCKINGHAM'S DEATH THE COMMAND OF THE FLEET AND ARMY WAS CONFERRED ON THE EARL OF LINDESEY
THE KING AFTER PROTRACTING THE TIME AS LONG AS HE COULD WENT INTO HIS COACH AND WAS SAFELY CONDUCTED TO THE ARMY WHO WERE HASTENING TO THEIR RENDEZVOUS AT TRIPLO HEATH NEAR CAMBRIDGE
GENERAL MASSEY ENGAGED TO SEIZE GLOUCESTER
THE BULK OF THE NATION CONSISTED OF ROYALISTS AND PRESBYTERIANS
THIS OPINION SO MUCH WARRANTED BY THE BOUNDLESS AMBITION AND PROFOUND DISSIMULATION OF HIS CHARACTER MEETS WITH READY BELIEF
TO THOSE WHO WILL MORE FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THEIR TRUST
BUT WHETHER FOUNDED IN A LOVE OF POWER OR ZEAL FOR LIBERTY IS STILL FROM HIS UNTIMELY END LEFT DOUBTFUL AND UNCERTAIN
THAT IS IN THE MANNER THE MOST REPUGNANT TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE KING AND ALL HIS PARTISANS
SIR MILES HOBART SIR PETER HEYMAN SELDEN CORITON LONG STRODE WERE COMMITTED TO PRISON ON ACCOUNT OF THE LAST TUMULT IN THE HOUSE WHICH WAS CALLED SEDITION THE KING'S POWER OF ADJOURNING AS WELL AS PROROGUING THE PARLIAMENT WAS AND IS NEVER QUESTIONED
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD LAY THE ISLE OF WIGHT OF WHICH HAMMOND WAS GOVERNOR
BLAKE HAVING HEARD THAT A SPANISH FLEET OF SIXTEEN SHIPS MUCH RICHER THAN THE FORMER HAD TAKEN SHELTER IN THE CANARIES IMMEDIATELY MADE SAIL TOWARDS THEM
FOR MY PART ADDED HE I AM MUCH PROUDER TO HAVE MY HEAD AFFIXED TO THE PLACE WHERE IT IS SENTENCED TO STAND THAN TO HAVE MY PICTURE HANG IN THE KING'S BED-CHAMBER
AND THOUGH THEY AFTERWARDS ADDED ONE SUBSIDY MORE THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED
285
THE KING FOLLOWED HIM ON HIS MARCH
AND THE FREQUENT PANICS TO WHICH MEN DURING THIS PERIOD WERE SO SUBJECT ON ACCOUNT OF THE CATHOLICS WERE LESS THE EFFECTS OF FEAR THAN OF EXTREME RAGE AND AVERSION ENTERTAINED AGAINST THEM

THE ROYALISTS WHO INSISTED UPON THE RESTORATION OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO RELIGION SECTS OR TENETS
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT HIGH AUTHORITY WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED THE COMMONS BESIDES CONFOUNDING AND OVERAWING THEIR OPPONENTS JUDGED IT REQUISITE TO INSPIRE COURAGE INTO THEIR FRIENDS AND ADHERENTS
THIS MAN FIRST FORMED THE PROJECT OF EXPELLING THE ENGLISH AND ASSERTING THE INDEPENDENCY OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY NALSON VOL
BUT SO LITTLE FORESIGHT HAD THEY POSSESSED IN THEIR ENTERPRISING SCHEMES THAT THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UNDER AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF EMBRACING THAT EXPEDIENT
RICHARD ELDEST SON OF THE PROTECTOR WAS BROUGHT TO COURT INTRODUCED INTO PUBLIC BUSINESS AND THENCEFORTH REGARDED BY MANY AS HIS HEIR IN THE PROTECTORSHIP
BUT I CONFESS THAT MY INDISCRETION SHOULD FORFEIT FOR THEM IT WOUNDS ME VERY DEEPLY
AND SO FAR FROM PERMITTING THE COMMUNICANTS TO BREAK THE SACRAMENTAL BREAD WITH THEIR FINGERS A PRIVILEGE ON WHICH THE PURITANS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED HE WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS ALLOW IT TO BE CUT WITH AN ORDINARY HOUSEHOLD INSTRUMENT
THIS MEASURE WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO THE KING
BAILLIE NOW ADVANCED IN ORDER TO REVENGE URREY'S DISCOMFITURE
286
THE KING COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE PRINCE IN WHICH HE RELATED THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION AND ACCOMPANIED HIS NARRATIVE WITH SEVERAL WISE AS WELL AS PATHETICAL REFLECTIONS AND ADVICES
THE CRIES OF THEIR AFFRIGHTED AND DISTRESSED BRETHREN IN IRELAND HE PROMISED HIMSELF WOULD POWERFULLY INCITE THEM TO SEND OVER SUCCORS WHICH COULD ARRIVE SO QUICKLY AND AID THEM WITH SUCH PROMPTITUDE IN THIS UTTERMOST DISTRESS
TO CROMWELL THE GARTER THE TITLE OF EARL OF ESSEX AND THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY
A FEW CASTLES WHICH BELONGED TO THE KING BEING UNPROVIDED WITH VICTUALS AMMUNITION AND GARRISONS WERE SOON SEIZED
1279
FOR I AM CONFIDENT THE SCOTS CANNOT HOLD OUT FIVE MONTHS THERE FOLLOWED SOME COUNSELS OF LAUD AND COTTINGTON EQUALLY VIOLENT WITH REGARD TO THE KING'S BEING ABSOLVED FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT CLARENDON VOL
THE PARLIAMENT AFRAID OF HIS FORMING SOME ACCOMMODATION WITH THE ARMY ADDRESSED HIM IN A MORE RESPECTFUL STYLE THAN FORMERLY
AND IF MOVED BY A REGARD TO PUBLIC GOOD HE EMPLOYS ANY EXERCISE OF POWER CONDEMNED BY RECENT AND EXPRESS STATUTE HOW GREEDILY IN SUCH DANGEROUS TIMES WILL FACTIOUS LEADERS SEIZE THIS PRETENCE OF THROWING ON HIS GOVERNMENT THE IMPUTATION OF TYRANNY AND DESPOTISM
IN ORDER AS HE PRETENDED TO MAKE THEM PAY THE EXPENSES TO WHICH THEIR MUTINOUS DISPOSITION CONTINUALLY EXPOSED THE PUBLIC
SOME SUDDEN MUTINY IN THE ARMY WAS JUSTLY DREADED
OTHERWISE THEY MUST NOT EXPECT TO SIT ANY LONGER AND THOUGH THESE HARSH COMMANDS WERE ENDEAVORED TO BE EXPLAINED AND MOLLIFIED A FEW DAYS AFTER BY A SPEECH OF BUCKINGHAM'S THEY FAILED NOT TO LEAVE A DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION BEHIND THEM
IT IS CRUEL SAID HE THAT LAWS SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED ME BY PARRICIDES AND PEDLERS BUT HIS WHOLE ARMY WAS ENCLOSED IN AN ISLAND AND MIGHT BE STARVED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
THEY INSISTED AS A NECESSARY PRELIMINARY THAT THE KING SHOULD ONCE ENTIRELY DESIST FROM LEVYING THESE DUTIES
THE ASSESSMENTS IN SCOTLAND WERE SOMETIMES TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A MONTH COMMONLY SIX THOUSAND
THE MORE PRUDENT COVENANTERS HAD CONCLUDED THAT THEIR PRETENSIONS BEING SO CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS AND STILL MORE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE KING IT WAS LIKELY THAT THEY SHOULD AGAIN BE OBLIGED TO SUPPORT THEIR CAUSE BY ARMS
AND WAS ENRAGED TO DISCOVER THAT CROMWELL IN ALL HIS ENTERPRISES HAD ENTERTAINED VIEWS OF PROMOTING HIS OWN GRANDEUR MORE THAN OF ENCOURAGING PIETY AND RELIGION OF WHICH HE MADE SUCH FERVENT PROFESSIONS
THE ROADS WERE STREWED WITH FLOWERS
AND BY THEIR WELL-COLORED PRETENCES AND PROFESSIONS THEY HAD OVERREACHED THE WHOLE NATION
465 466 467
BUT HE SOON RECONCILED HIS MIND TO THIS AS HE HAD DONE TO HIS OTHER CALAMITIES
THEY HAVE INVENTED A KIND OF ACCUMULATIVE OR CONSTRUCTIVE EVIDENCE BY WHICH MANY ACTIONS EITHER TOTALLY INNOCENT IN THEMSELVES OR CRIMINAL IN A MUCH INFERIOR DEGREE SHALL WHEN UNITED AMOUNT TO TREASON AND SUBJECT THE PERSON TO THE HIGHEST PENALTIES INFLICTED BY THE LAW
NOTE R P
THEY DESIRED HIM TO LAY THE GROUNDS OF ACCUSATION BEFORE THE HOUSE
THE EXALTING OF THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THE DIMINISHING OF THE KING'S WERE STILL THE OBJECTS PURSUED BY THE MAJORITY
P 794
AND FOR THIS INCONVENIENCE THOUGH HE HAD NOT FORESEEN IT HE WELL KNEW BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE TO PROVIDE A PROPER REMEDY
555
AND WERE RECEIVED BY THE NATION THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH APPEARING OPPOSITION YET WITH GREAT INWARD APPREHENSION AND DISCONTENT
CONTEMPORARY MONARCHS
AND REPRESENTS THAT INCIDENT AS A BRANCH OF THE SAME PIOUS CONTRIVANCE WHICH HAD EXCITED THE IRISH INSURRECTION AND BY WHICH THE PROFANE HERETICS WOULD SOON BE EXTERMINATED IN ENGLAND RUSH
THOSE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS IT MUST BE OWNED WHO HAD INTRODUCED SUCH MIGHTY INNOVATIONS INTO THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION AND WHO HAD PROJECTED SO MUCH GREATER HAD NOT ENGAGED IN AN ENTERPRISE WHICH EXCEEDED THEIR COURAGE AND CAPACITY
AND THAT HE HAD NO COMMISSION AT ALL TO TREAT OF ANY THING ELSE WITHOUT THE PRIVITY AND DIRECTION OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT MUCH LESS TO CAPITULATE ANY THING CONCERNING RELIGION OR ANY PROPERTY BELONGING EITHER TO CHURCH OR LAITY THOUGH THIS DECLARATION SEEMS AGREEABLE TO TRUTH IT GAVE NO SATISFACTION TO THE PARLIAMENT
NO INDIVIDUAL OF ANY SEPT ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS HAD THE PROPERTY OF ANY PARTICULAR ESTATE
TRIALS WERE MADE TO PROCURE A VESSEL FOR HIS ESCAPE
THE DUKE OF YORK IMMEDIATELY WENT ON BOARD AND TOOK THE COMMAND OF THE FLEET AS HIGH ADMIRAL

FARR AND E.H
ALMOST ALL THE CLERGY OF WALES BEING EJECTED AS MALIGNANTS ITINERANT PREACHERS WITH SMALL SALARIES WERE SETTLED NOT ABOVE FOUR OR FIVE IN EACH COUNTY

ANOTHER IN A LIKE DISGUISE HELD UP TO THE SPECTATORS THE HEAD STREAMING WITH BLOOD AND CRIED ALOUD THIS IS THE HEAD OF A TRAITOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE GRIEF INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE NOT ONLY AMONG THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE OVERWHELMED WITH A FLOOD OF SORROW BUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE NATION AS SOON AS THE REPORT OF THIS FATAL EXECUTION WAS CONVEYED TO THEM
HE DIED IN 1674 AGED SIXTY-SIX
HE DIED IN 1674 AGED SIXTY-SIX
THE POPULACE WITHOUT DOORS WERE READY TO EXECUTE FROM THE LEAST HINT THE WILL OF THEIR LEADERS
THE PLAGUE WAS REALLY SO VIOLENT THAT IT HAD BEEN MOVED IN THE HOUSE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION TO PETITION THE KING TO ADJOURN THEM
THE VICTORY HOWEVER OVER THE HUGONOTS WAS AT FIRST PUSHED BY THE FRENCH KING WITH GREAT MODERATION
AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
THE PEOPLE FREED FROM THE STATE OF SUSPENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG BEEN HELD NOW CHANGED THEIR ANXIOUS HOPE FOR THE UNMIXED EFFUSIONS OF JOY
772
TO GRATIFY THE ARMY THE PARLIAMENT INVESTED FAIRFAX WITH THE TITLE OF GENERAL-IN-CHIEF OF ALL THE FORCES IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND
CLARENDON TELLS US A PLEASANT INCIDENT TO THIS PURPOSE
BUT HIS PERFORMANCES STILL ABOUND WITH MANY FAULTS AND WHAT IS MORE MATERIAL THEY CONTAIN BUT FEEBLE AND SUPERFICIAL BEAUTIES
HE WROTE A LETTER IN WHICH HE ENTREATED THE KING FOR THE SAKE OF PUBLIC PEACE TO PUT AN END TO HIS UNFORTUNATE HOWEVER INNOCENT LIFE AND TO QUIET THE TUMULTUOUS PEOPLE BY GRANTING THEM THE REQUEST FOR WHICH THEY WERE SO IMPORTUNATE CLARENDON VOL
THE COURT WAS APT TO THINK THAT SO REFRACTORY A SPIRIT MUST BY ANY EXPEDIENT BE BROKEN AND SUBDUED
AND THEY COMMITTED TO PRISON SIR WILLIAM WALLER SIR JOHN CLOTWORTHY THE GENERALS MASSEY BROWN COPLEY AND OTHER LEADERS OF THE PRESBYTERIANS
AS THE DUKE KNEW THAT AUTHORITY ALONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE HE EMPLOYED MUCH ART AND MANY SUBTLETIES TO ENGAGE THEM TO OBEDIENCE
AND IT BECAME REQUISITE WE ARE TOLD FOR ALL PHYSICIANS TO BE EXPERT IN THE SPIRITUAL PROFESSION AND BY THEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO ALLAY THOSE RELIGIOUS TERRORS WITH WHICH THEIR PATIENTS WERE SO GENERALLY HAUNTED
AND THE PARLIAMENT HAD NO FURTHER OCCUPATION THAN TO FILL ALL THE JAILS WITH THEIR OPEN OR SECRET ENEMIES
THE PEERS AND COMMONS FORMED ONLY ONE HOUSE IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
AND THAT AS THESE CONCESSIONS HOWEVER NECESSARY WOULD GIVE GREAT SCANDAL TO THE PROTESTANT ZEALOTS IN HIS THREE KINGDOMS IF WOULD BE REQUISITE BOTH TO CONCEAL THEM DURING SOME TIME AND TO PRESERVE ORMOND'S CHARACTER BY GIVING PRIVATE ORDERS TO GLAMORGAN TO CONCLUDE AND SIGN THESE ARTICLES
ON WHICHEVER SIDE THE KING CAST HIS EYES HE SAW NO RESOURCE OR SECURITY
BUT THE CONTRARY PRACTICE HAD OFTEN PREVAILED D'EWES P
THE RIGOR OF THE SUBSEQUENT PARLIAMENTS HAD BEEN EXTREME WITH REGARD TO MANY ARTICLES PARTICULARLY TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE
THOUGH HE WOULD NOT HAVE VENTURED MUCH TO HAVE PROCURED IT END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND IN THREE VOLUMES VOL.I PART E BY DAVID HUME
108 109
TO THE REST THE REMEDY COULD BE OBTAINED ONLY BY PAYING LARGE COMPOSITIONS AND SUBSCRIBING THE COVENANT WHICH THEY ABHORRED
THE SAME WARMTH OF TEMPER WHICH MADE CROMWELL A FRANTIC ENTHUSIAST RENDERED HIM THE MOST DANGEROUS OF HYPOCRITES
I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME AND PLEASE MYSELF WITH THE SIGHT OF A CROWN AND SCEPTRE THOUGH EVEN THESE TWIGS WOULD NOT LONG FLOURISH WHEN THE STOCK UPON WHICH THEY GREW WAS DEAD BUT AS TO TRUE AND REAL POWER I SHOULD REMAIN BUT THE OUTSIDE BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
CROMWELL WAS DECLARED PROTECTOR
FEW OF THE POPULAR PARTY COULD PERCEIVE THIS CONNECTION
ON WELDON'S APPROACH GRANVILLE WHO IMAGINED THAT FAIRFAX WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY WAS UPON HIM RAISED THE SIEGE AND ALLOWED THIS PERTINACIOUS TOWN NOW HALF TAKEN AND HALF BURNED TO RECEIVE RELIEF
HE WAS WILLING TO ALLOW IT CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THAT CHURCH
HE SAID NO FROM THE GENERAL
BUT THE CHIEF RESOURCE OF THE SCOTTISH MALECONTENTS WAS IN THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR OWN VIGOR AND ABILITIES
AND EXCEPTING A FEW ROYALISTS WHO REMAINED SOME TIME IN THE MOUNTAINS UNDER THE EARL OF GLENCAIRN LORD BALCARRAS AND GENERAL MIDDLETON THAT KINGDOM WHICH HAD HITHERTO THROUGH ALL AGES BY MEANS OF ITS SITUATION POVERTY AND VALOR MAINTAINED ITS INDEPENDENCE WAS REDUCED TO TOTAL SUBJECTION
WE SCARCELY FIND BY THAT COLLECTION THAT ANY SECRET COUNSELS OF FOREIGN STATES EXCEPT THOSE OF HOLLAND WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE CONCEALED WERE KNOWN TO THE PROTECTOR
OF LATE YEARS IT HAD BEEN SO USUAL A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION TO DISCOURSE OF PARLIAMENTS AND COUNCILS AND SENATES AND THE SOLDIERS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN SO MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO ENTER INTO THAT SPIRIT THAT CROMWELL THOUGHT IT REQUISITE TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT BEAR THE FACE OF A COMMONWEALTH
WE CONSECRATE THIS CHURCH AND SEPARATE IT UNTO THEE AS HOLY GROUND NOT TO BE PROFANED ANY MORE TO COMMON USES AFTER THIS THE BISHOP STANDING NEAR THE COMMUNION TABLE SOLEMNLY PRONOUNCED MANY IMPRECATIONS UPON SUCH AS SHOULD AFTERWARDS POLLUTE THAT HOLY PLACE BY MUSTERS OF SOLDIERS OR KEEPING IN IT PROFANE LAW-COURTS OR CARRYING BURDENS THROUGH IT
THE REPLACING HIM IN THE SAME RIGHTS WHICH HAD EVER BEEN ENJOYED BY HIS PREDECESSORS
AND THY HEAD TOO THEY WILL CUT OFF AT LAST
AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT CHARLES ALL ALONG CONSIDERS THE LORD LIEUTENANT AS THE PERSON WHO WAS CONDUCTING THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IRISH
THE MAN WHOSE MILITARY GENIUS BOTH BY VALOR AND CONDUCT HAD SHONE FORTH BEYOND ANY WHICH DURING THESE CIVIL DISORDERS HAD APPEARED IN THE THREE KINGDOMS
BUT THE GREAT ARTICLE ON WHICH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BROKE WITH THE KING AND WHICH FINALLY CREATED IN CHARLES A DISGUST TO ALL PARLIAMENTS WAS THEIR CLAIM WITH REGARD TO TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE
WHERE DELAY WAS REQUISITE HE COULD EMPLOY THE MOST INDEFATIGABLE PATIENCE
AND HE THOUGHT THAT ON HIS PART HE HAD MADE VERY SATISFACTORY CONCESSIONS WHEN HE OFFERED TO SUSPEND THE CANONS AND THE LITURGY TILL IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY THEY COULD BE RECEIVED
THE LETTER ACCOMPANIED WITH A DECLARATION GREEDILY READ
THEY EVEN INTERCEPTED SOME SMALL SUCCORS SENT THITHER BY THE KING
APP
APP
APP
UNDER COLOR OF MALIGNANCY THEY EXERCISED VENGEANCE AGAINST THEIR PRIVATE ENEMIES
AND WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE OFFICER WHO CONDUCTED THE ATTACK WAS A PAPIST A VIOLENT OUTCRY WAS RAISED AGAINST THE KING FOR EMPLOYING THAT HATED SECT IN THE MURDER OF HIS PROTESTANT SUBJECTS IT MAY BE WORTHY OF REMARK THAT SEVERAL MUTINIES HAD ARISEN AMONG THE ENGLISH TROOPS WHEN MARCHING TO JOIN THE ARMY
HAVING LANDED HIS MEN THOUGH WITH SOME LOSS HE FOLLOWED NOT THE BLOW BUT ALLOWED TOIRAS THE FRENCH GOVERNOR FIVE DAYS RESPITE DURING WHICH ST MARTIN WAS VICTUALLED AND PROVIDED FOR A SIEGE RUSHWORTH VOL I
AND ABOVE ALL THE SPIRIT OF ENTHUSIASM BEING UNIVERSALLY DIFFUSED DISAPPOINTED ALL THE VIEWS OF HUMAN PRUDENCE AND DISTURBED THE OPERATION OF EVERY MOTIVE WHICH USUALLY INFLUENCES SOCIETY
IT IS CONFIRMED BY THE WHOLE ANALOGY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND CONSTITUTION
EVEN ACCORDING TO THOSE PRINCIPLES WHICH IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION HE WAS PERHAPS OBLIGED TO ADOPT HIS BEHAVIOR IN GENERAL WILL APPEAR NOT A LITTLE HARSH AND BARBAROUS
AND WHEN IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE POSSESSED ONLY THE VIRTUES OF PRIVATE LIFE WHICH IN HIS SITUATION WERE SO MANY VICES
EVERY ORDER OR INSTITUTION WHICH DEPENDED ON MONARCHY WAS INVADED
FOUR HUNDRED WERE TAKEN PRISONERS
TOGETHER WITH SATISFACTION IN ARREARS FREEDOM FROM PRESSING RELIEF OF WIDOWS AND MAIMED SOLDIERS AND PAY TILL DISBANDED THE COMMONS AWARE OF WHAT COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS THE ARMY WAS COMPOSED WERE ALARMED AT THIS INTELLIGENCE
THESE CONCESSIONS THOUGH CONSIDERABLE GAVE NO SATISFACTION TO THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD
NEITHER NEED WE FEAR THAT THIS IS THE CRITICAL PARLIAMENT AS HAS BEEN INSINUATED
I DID NOT I SUPPOSE AT THIS PASSAGE HE CRIED
BEING ACCUSED OF TREACHERY AND A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ENEMY MONTROSE OPENLY AVOWED THE LETTER AND ASKED THE GENERALS IF THEY DARED TO CALL THEIR SOVEREIGN AN ENEMY

GREAT WAS NOW THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL MEN WHEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL CONCISE AND CLEAR FORM BY WHICH A BILL IS EITHER CONFIRMED OR REJECTED CHARLES SAID IN ANSWER TO THE PETITION THE KING WILLETH THAT RIGHT BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE REALM AND THAT THE STATUTES BE PUT INTO EXECUTION
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS NOW ASSEMBLED BEING WILLING TO AWAKEN THE PEOPLE'S TENDERNESS BY EXCITING THEIR FEARS IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE ALARM

FRANCE FROM POLICY HAD FOMENTED THE FIRST DISORDERS IN SCOTLAND HAD SENT OVER ARMS TO THE IRISH REBELS AND CONTINUED TO GIVE COUNTENANCE TO THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
THIS WAS GENERALLY CONSTRUED AS A DECLARATION THAT DURING THIS REIGN NO MORE PARLIAMENTS WERE INTENDED TO BE SUMMONED AND EVERY MEASURE OF THE KING'S CONFIRMED A SUSPICION SO DISAGREEABLE TO THE GENERALITY OF THE PEOPLE
I AM SENSIBLE INTO WHAT HANDS I AM FALLEN

THEY SENT FOR BAILLIE AN OFFICER OF REPUTATION FROM ENGLAND
1634 SHIP MONEY WAS NOW INTRODUCED
THEY HAD BEEN TOLD BY CROMWELL IN HIS FIRST DISCOURSE THAT HE NEVER LOOKED TO SEE SUCH A DAY WHEN CHRIST SHOULD BE SO OWNED PARL
AND ALL THE MINISTERS OF STATE COUNSELLORS AND JUDGES WERE BY LAW TO HOLD THEIR PLACES DURING LIFE OR GOOD BEHAVIOR THE KING WHILE IN SCOTLAND CONFORMED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH AND ASSISTED WITH GREAT GRAVITY AT THE LONG PRAYERS AND LONGER SERMONS WITH WHICH THE PRESBYTERIANS ENDEAVORED TO REGALE HIM
AND THEY ALLOWED HIM TO RETIRE PEACEABLY TO HIS COUNTRY HOUSE

THAT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND EVEN TO THEM HIS PRETENDED JUDGES HE WAS DESIROUS IF CALLED UPON IN ANOTHER MANNER TO PROVE THE INTEGRITY OF HIS CONDUCT AND ASSERT THE JUSTICE OF THOSE DEFENSIVE ARMS TO WHICH UNWILLINGLY AND UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD HAD RECOURSE
IT WAS USUAL FOR THE PRETENDED SAINTS AT THAT TIME TO CHANGE THEIR NAMES FROM HENRY EDWARD ANTHONY WILLIAM WHICH THEY REGARDED AS HEATHENISH INTO OTHERS MORE SANCTIFIED AND GODLY
AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT PROVE DANGEROUS FOR MONK HIMSELF TO HAVE ASSEMBLED ANY CONSIDERABLE BODY OF HIS REPUBLICAN ARMY FOR THEIR SUPPRESSION
LET HIM RETAIN THAT HONOR SAID FAIRFAX
WALLER FELL UPON HIM AT CHERINGTON AND GAVE HIM A DEFEAT OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE
THE AUTHOR IT MUST BE OWNED HAD IN PLAINER TERMS BLAMED THE HIERARCHY THE CEREMONIES THE INNOVATIONS IN RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND THE NEW SUPERSTITIONS INTRODUCED BY LAUD AND THIS PROBABLY TOGETHER WITH THE OBSTINACY AND PETULANCE OF HIS BEHAVIOR BEFORE THE STAR CHAMBER WAS THE REASON WHY HIS SENTENCE WAS SO SEVERE
THIRTY MEMBERS WERE RETURNED FROM SCOTLAND
11TH OF SEPTEMBER 1644
AND PARTLY FROM THAT MOTIVE PARTLY FROM THE UNCONTROLLABLE FURY OF HIS ZEAL HE ALWAYS JOINED THAT PARTY WHICH PUSHED EVERY THING TO EXTREMITIES AGAINST THE KING
EQUALLY FULL OF FRAUD AND OF ARDOR THESE PIOUS PATRIOTS TALKED PERPETUALLY OF SEEKING THE LORD YET STILL PURSUED THEIR OWN PURPOSES
120
AND ARE RESOLVED THAT THE FABRIC WHICH THEY HAVE GENEROUSLY UNDERTAKEN TO WEAR FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIBERTY SHALL NOT BE LEFT TO FUTURE AGES INSECURE AND IMPERFECT
THE NOBILITY THOUGH COURTED BY HIM KEPT AT A DISTANCE AND DISDAINED TO INTERMIX WITH THOSE MEAN PERSONS WHO WERE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS GOVERNMENT
MAGUIRE AT HIS EXECUTION MADE A LIKE CONFESSION
WHEN THE KING PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THIS COMPANY A GREAT AND SENSIBLE ALTERATION WAS REMARKED IN HIS ASPECT FROM WHAT IT APPEARED THE YEAR BEFORE WHEN HE RESIDED AT HAMPTON COURT
YET HE PROMISES FAITHFULLY UPON HIS WORD AND HONOR NOT TO ACQUAINT HIS MAJESTY WITH THIS DEFEASANCE TILL HE HAD ENDEAVORED AS FAR AS IN HIM LAY TO INDUCE HIS MAJESTY TO THE GRANTING OF THE PARTICULARS IN THE SAID ARTICLES
THE WHOLE SCOTTISH ARMY WAS EITHER KILLED OR TAKEN PRISONERS
A CONDITION TO WHICH THEY KNEW THAT WITHOUT RENDERING HIMSELF FOREVER VILE AND CONTEMPTIBLE HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY SUBMIT
THE KING OF DENMARK AND DUKE OF HOLSTEIN SENT HIM SOME SMALL SUPPLY OF MONEY

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING OLERON A FERTILE ISLAND AND DEFENCELESS HE BENT HIS COURSE TO THE ISLE OF RHE WHICH WAS WELL GARRISONED AND FORTIFIED
78 MAY BOOK II
THE COMMON LAW WAS DENOMINATED A BADGE OF THE CONQUEST AND OF NORMAN SLAVERY
IT WAS LEVIED UPON THE PEOPLE WITH EQUALITY
AS IT IS NOT USUAL FOR THE MINISTERS WHO ARE PUT IN THE LIST OF CANDIDATES TO CLAIM A VOTE ALL THE ELECTIONS BY THAT MEANS FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LAITY
AND EXERCISING AN AUTHORITY ALMOST ABSOLUTE OVER THE WHOLE CIVIL POWER MADE EVERY POLITICAL CONSIDERATION YIELD TO THEIR THEOLOGICAL ZEAL AND PREJUDICES
THE TOWN OF STIRLING LAY AT HIS BACK AND THE WHOLE NORTH SUPPLIED HIM WITH PROVISIONS
BUT THERE SCARCELY EVER SAT ABOVE SEVENTY
AND EVERY YEAR BROUGHT AN ACCESSION OF FORCE AND GRANDEUR TO THE FRENCH MONARCHY

1642 A FEW DAYS AFTER THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL
THIS MAN WAS VIRTUOUS IF SEVERITY OF MANNERS ALONE AND ABSTINENCE FROM PLEASURE COULD DESERVE THAT NAME
THAT NO MAXIM OF POLICY WAS MORE UNDISPUTED THAN THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING AN INSEPARABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CIVIL AND MILITARY POWERS AND OF RETAINING THE LATTER IN STRICT SUBORDINATION TO THE FORMER
AND ON HIS DEATH THE PLACE WAS IMMEDIATELY TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE COUNCIL
THE KING HIMSELF FOUND THAT HE WAS CONSIDERED AS A MERE PAGEANT OF STATE AND THAT THE FEW REMAINS OF ROYALTY WHICH HE POSSESSED SERVED ONLY TO DRAW ON HIM THE GREATER INDIGNITIES
AND PUTTING RAINSBOROW THEIR ADMIRAL ASHORE SAILED OVER TO HOLLAND WHERE THE PRINCE OF WALES TOOK THE COMMAND OF THEM CLARENDON VOL
THE CLERGY OF SCOTLAND THOUGH SUCH TUMULT WAS EXCITED ABOUT RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND DISCIPLINE WERE BOTH POOR AND IN SMALL NUMBERS
BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
AND NONE DARED FOR SOME DAYS TO MAKE ANY MENTION OF THE KING
548
AND WHEN THEY ACCOMPANIED THE ENGLISH COMMISSIONERS TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT THEY SECRETLY FORMED A TREATY WITH THE KING FOR ARMING SCOTLAND IN HIS FAVOR CL
WE MUST VINDICATE--WHAT
IRETON SEEMING TO SPEAK THE SENSE OF THE ARMY UNDER THE APPELLATION OF MANY THOUSAND GODLY MEN WHO HAD VENTURED THEIR LIVES IN DEFENCE OF THE PARLIAMENT SAID THAT THE KING BY DENYING THE FOUR BILLS HAD REFUSED SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO HIS PEOPLE
THE SPEAKER WAS PUSHED BACK INTO THE CHAIR AND FORCIBLY HELD IN IT BY HOLLIS AND VALENTINE TILL A SHORT REMONSTRANCE WAS FRAMED AND WAS PASSED BY ACCLAMATION RATHER THAN BY VOTE
BUT THESE INSTITUTIONS THEY FOUND GREAT DIFFICULTY TO EXECUTE
TO JOIN THE KING BEFORE HE HAD SUBSCRIBED THE COVENANT WAS IN THEIR EYES TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS HONOR BEFORE CHRIST HAD OBTAINED HIS AND THEY THUNDERED OUT ANATHEMAS AGAINST EVERY ONE WHO PAID OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT
AND THE TAKING AWAY OF TITHES WHICH THEY CALLED A RELIC OF JUDAISM
WHEN HE WAS CARRIED BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS THEN SITTING LOUDON THE CHANCELLOR IN A VIOLENT DECLAMATION REPROACHED HIM WITH THE BREACH OF THE NATIONAL COVENANT WHICH HE HAD SUBSCRIBED
WAS HE JUSTIFIABLE BECAUSE FROM ONE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT HE HAD MET WITH HARSH AND UNKIND TREATMENT TO MAKE IN REVENGE AN INVASION ON THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE WHOLE NATION
AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS
AND THEY CONDEMNED HIM TO BE IMPRISONED IN A DUNGEON AND TO BE LOADED WITH IRONS IT WAS FOUND DIFFICULT TO BREAK THE SPIRITS OF MEN WHO PLACED BOTH THEIR HONOR AND THEIR CONSCIENCE IN SUFFERING
WHO HAD FORMERLY REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THE KING'S MESSAGE WHEN HE PEACEABLY DEMANDED THESE MEMBERS
THEY WERE DETERMINED THEREFORE UPON THIS OCCASION TO MAKE AT ONCE A FULL EXPERIMENT OF THEIR OWN POWER AND OF THEIR GENERAL'S OBEDIENCE
HE HAD NO EAR FOR HARMONY
629 630
LET THE WAITING UPON JEHOVAH SAID THAT MILITARY SAINT BE THE GREATEST AND MOST CONSIDERABLE BUSINESS YOU HAVE EVERY DAY
257
AND FROM HIS ABHORRENCE OF THAT SUPERSTITIOUS FIGURE WOULD NOT ANY WHERE ALLOW ONE PIECE OF WOOD OR STONE TO LIE OVER ANOTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES THE BISHOP OF ELY AND OTHER CLERGYMEN WERE ATTACKED ON ACCOUNT OF INNOVATIONS COZENS WHO HAD LONG BEEN OBNOXIOUS WAS EXPOSED TO NEW CENSURES
HERE IS A PASSAGE OF SIR JOHN DAVIS'S QUESTION CONCERNING IMPOSITIONS P
THEY ALSO INTRODUCED AN INNOVATION WHICH SERVED STILL FURTHER TO REDUCE THE CLERGY TO SUBJECTION
AND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INTELLIGENCE OF A CONFEDERACY SO GENERALLY DIFFUSED AMONG A PARTY WHO VALUED THEMSELVES MORE ON ZEAL AND COURAGE THAN ON SECRECY AND SOBRIETY MANY OF THE ROYALISTS WERE THROWN INTO PRISON
THEIR PROVISIONS WERE DEFECTIVE BOTH IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY
AND LAMBERT EITHER DECEIVED BY HIS DISSIMULATION OR IN HIS TURN FEIGNING TO BE DECEIVED STILL CONTINUED NOTWITHSTANDING THIS DISAPPOINTMENT HIS FRIENDSHIP AND CONNECTIONS WITH CROMWELL
THEIR FATHERS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ELIZABETH
THIS STORY IS TOLD DIFFERENTLY IN HOBART'S REPORTS P
AND HE DEFEATED THEM IN MANY RENCOUNTERS WHICH THOUGH OF THEMSELVES OF NO GREAT MOMENT PROVED FATAL TO THEIR DECLINING CAUSE
THE PARLIAMENT NOW CAME TO A PAUSE
TO APPEASE THE RISING DISPLEASURE OF THE COMMONS HE DESIRED TO BE HEARD AT THEIR BAR
THE EARL OF BEDFORD LORD HOWARD SIR PHILIP STAPLETON SIR WILLIAM ARMYNE FIENNES AND HAMBDEN WERE THE PERSONS CHOSEN RUSH
IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE INTEREST BOTH OF KING AND PARLIAMENT TO FINISH THEIR TREATY WITH ALL EXPEDITION
72 73 78
WHEREFORE LET IT BE THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT AND RESOLUTION OF US ALL TO MAKE A VOW AND COVENANT HENCEFORTH TO HOLD FAST OUR GOD AND OUR RELIGION
AND IN THE PROPOSALS WHICH THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS SENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION THEY INSISTED NEITHER ON THE ABOLITION OF EPISCOPACY NOR ON THE PUNISHMENT OF THE ROYALISTS
IRELAND BEING ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE ARMY CHOSE FEW BUT SUCH OFFICERS AS WERE MOST ACCEPTABLE TO HIM
THE GREATEST INTEREST COULD NOT ENGAGE HIM IN ANY COURT OF JUDICATURE TO SWEAR EVEN TO THE TRUTH
AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS AND HAVING THUS PREVAILED IN SO MANY BATTLES WHICH HIS VIGOR EVER RENDERED AS DECISIVE AS THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL HE SUMMONED TOGETHER ALL HIS FRIENDS AND PARTISANS AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR MARCHING INTO THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES IN ORDER TO PUT A FINAL PERIOD TO THE POWER OF THE COVENANTERS AND DISSIPATE THE PARLIAMENT WHICH WITH GREAT POMP AND SOLEMNITY THEY HAD SUMMONED TO MEET AT ST JOHNSTONE'S
AND HE HAD LEFT THAT SERVICE WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY DISGUST FROM THE ROYAL FAMILY
YET WAS THIS IMPORTANT PLACE GUARDED AND THAT TOO WITHOUT ANY CARE BY NO GREATER FORCE THAN FIFTY MEN
THE RIVER WAS COVERED WITH BOATS AND OTHER VESSELS LADEN WITH SMALL PIECES OF ORDNANCE AND PREPARED FOR FIGHT
BUT THEY NOW ESTABLISHED BY AN ORDINANCE THE PRESBYTERIAN MODEL IN ALL ITS FORMS OF CONGREGATIONAL CLASSICAL PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES
514
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND ANOTHER CHARACTER SO UNEXCEPTIONABLE IN THIS PARTICULAR
YET THE LATE ABUSE HAVING FOR THE PRESENT DRIVEN HIM UNWILLINGLY OUT OF THAT COURSE
THEY DETERMINED BY A GENERAL ORDINANCE ALL THE CASES IN WHICH EXCOMMUNICATION COULD BE USED
507 508
AND THE GENERALS VEHEMENTLY INSISTED WITH THE PRELATE THAT HE SHOULD INFORM THEM OF THE KING'S MEANING JUXON TOLD THEM THAT THE KING HAVING FREQUENTLY CHARGED HIM TO INCULCATE ON HIS SON THE FORGIVENESS OF HIS MURDERERS HAD TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE WHEN HIS COMMANDS HE SUPPOSED WOULD BE REGARDED AS SACRED AND INVIOLABLE TO REITERATE THAT DESIRE
PRIVILEGES IN PARTICULAR WHICH ARE FOUNDED ON THE GREAT CHARTER MUST ALWAYS REMAIN IN FORCE BECAUSE DERIVED FROM A SOURCE OF NEVER-FAILING AUTHORITY REGARDED IN ALL AGES AS THE MOST SACRED CONTRACT BETWEEN KING AND PEOPLE
THE MALECONTENTS HAD BEEN VERY INDUSTRIOUS IN REPRESENTING TO THE ENGLISH THE GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH SCOTLAND LABORED AND THE ILL COUNSELS WHICH HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO THEIR SOVEREIGN
SENT FOR THE COMMONS
DON LOUIS RECEIVED HIM WITH THAT GENEROUS CIVILITY PECULIAR TO HIS NATION
THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED TO LEVY THESE LOANS AMONG OTHER ARTICLES OF SECRET INSTRUCTION WERE ENJOINED IF ANY SHALL REFUSE TO LEND AND SHALL MAKE DELAYS OR EXCUSES AND PERSIST IN HIS OBSTINACY THAT THEY EXAMINE HIM UPON OATH WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DEALT WITH TO DENY OR REFUSE TO LEND OR MAKE AN EXCUSE FOR NOT LENDING
IN A FEW DAYS THEY HAD BEEN FORMIDABLE
CLEMENT WALKER'S HISTORY OF THE TWO JUNTOS PREFIXED TO HIS HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY P
THIS LAST MEASURE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONCERTED WITH THE GENERAL WHO KNEW THAT ALL MEN HOWEVER DIFFERENT IN AFFECTIONS EXPECTATIONS AND DESIGNS UNITED IN THEIR DETESTATION OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT
MADE HIM PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF YORK AND DEPUTY OF IRELAND
BUT HE REJECTED IT AS FOOLISH
LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY
BY THE SAME TITLE THAT THE PRESBYTERIANS IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE ROYALISTS HAD APPROPRIATED TO THEMSELVES THE EPITHET OF GODLY OR THE WELL AFFECTED THE INDEPENDENTS DID NOW IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE PRESBYTERIANS ASSUME THIS MAGNIFICENT APPELLATION AND ARROGATE ALL THE ASCENDANT WHICH NATURALLY BELONGS TO IT
IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT CROMWELL MADE USE OF THIS REASON WHY HE ADMITTED RARELY OF VISITS FROM THE KING'S FRIENDS AND SHOWED LESS FAVOR THAN FORMERLY TO THE ROYAL CAUSE
ENTIRELY TO ABROGATE IT IS IMPRACTICABLE
HARRINGTON'S OCEANA WAS WELL ADAPTED TO THAT AGE WHEN THE PLANS OF IMAGINARY REPUBLICS WERE THE DAILY SUBJECTS OF DEBATE AND CONVERSATION
EVEN BAPTISM AND THE LORD'S SUPPER BY ALL OTHER SECTS BELIEVED TO BE INTERWOVEN WITH THE VERY VITALS OF CHRISTIANITY WERE DISDAINFULLY REJECTED BY THEM
WHAT MADNESS WHILE EVERY THING IS SO HAPPILY SETTLED UNDER ANCIENT FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS NOW MORE EXACTLY POISED AND ADJUSTED TO TRY THE HAZARDOUS EXPERIMENT OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AND RENOUNCE THE MATURE WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS FOR THE CRUDE WHIMSEYS OF TURBULENT INNOVATORS
THE IMPUTATION OF INSINCERITY ON CHARLES I LIKE MOST PARTY CLAMORS IS DIFFICULT TO BE REMOVED
AND THESE WERE INVITED OVER TO ASSIST THEIR COUNTRY IN HER PRESENT NECESSITY
AND AS THE GOVERNMENT WAS HITHERTO A MANIFEST USURPATION IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER TO SANCTIFY IT BY A SEEMING CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
THOUGH OF A POLITE AND COURTLY BEHAVIOR HE DIED LAMENTED BY NO PARTY
SIR HARRY VANE AND THE OLD REPUBLICANS WHO MAINTAINED THE INDISSOLUBLE AUTHORITY OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT ENCOURAGED THE MURMURS AGAINST THE PRESENT USURPATION
AS HE HAD HERE MANY FRIENDS SO HAD HE ALSO SOME OPPONENTS
AND HE PROGNOSTICATED A STILL WORSE EVENT FROM THE ENSUING SUMMER
HE DESIRED TO BE DEEPLY HUMBLED AND AFFLICTED IN SPIRIT BECAUSE OF HIS FATHER'S FOLLOWING WICKED MEASURES OPPOSING THE COVENANT AND THE WORK OF REFORMATION AND SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF GOD'S PEOPLE THROUGHOUT ALL HIS DOMINIONS
AND THE WHOLE ARMY HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILTY OF SUCH ILLEGAL AND ATROCIOUS ACTIONS THAT THEY COULD ENTERTAIN NO FURTHER SCRUPLE WITH REGARD TO ANY ENTERPRISE WHICH MIGHT SERVE THEIR SELFISH OR FANATICAL PURPOSES
AND THE SEVERITY AND APPLICATION REQUISITE TO THE SUPPORT OF DISCIPLINE WERE QUALITIES IN WHICH HE WAS ENTIRELY WANTING WHEN PRINCE RUPERT CONTRARY TO HIS ADVICE RESOLVED ON THIS BATTLE AND ISSUED ALL ORDERS WITHOUT COMMUNICATING HIS INTENTIONS TO HIM HE TOOK THE FIELD BUT HE SAID MERELY AS A VOLUNTEER
THEIR OWN MERITS TOO THEY ASSERTED TOWARDS THE KING WERE NO LESS EMINENT THAN TOWARDS THE PEOPLE
IN THE SPRING IT WAS BROKEN BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES
THOUGH THIS INCIDENT CONSIDERING THE EXAMPLE OF STRATFORD'S IMPEACHMENT AND THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF THE NATION AND PARLIAMENT NEEDED BE NO SURPRISE TO HIM YET WAS HE BETRAYED INTO SOME PASSION WHEN THE ACCUSATION WAS PRESENTED
IF HE SEDUCED THE MILITARY FANATICS IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THEIR INTERESTS AND HIS EVIDENTLY CONCURRED
THE REBELS RAISED THE SIEGE OF TREDAH AFTER AN OBSTINATE DEFENCE MADE BY THE GARRISON ORMOND HAD OBTAINED TWO COMPLETE VICTORIES AT KILRUSH AND ROSS
THE SAME VEHEMENCE OF TEMPER WHICH HAD TRANSPORTED HIM INTO THE EXTREMES OF PLEASURE NOW DISTINGUISHED HIS RELIGIOUS HABITS
437
HE WAS BUT ONE MAN
THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE INFORMED OF THESE LAST ACQUISITIONS THEY AFFRONTED THE QUEEN BY OPENING SOME INTERCEPTED LETTERS WRITTEN TO HER BY LORD DIGBY
PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS EVEN BEFORE THEIR VICTORY WAS FULLY COMPLETED FELL INTO CONTESTS ABOUT THE DIVISION OF THE SPOIL
AND ALL ORDERS OF MEN HAD DRUNK DEEP OF THE INTOXICATING POISON
BUT LET GOD BE TO YOU AND THEM ALL IN ALL GOING TO DISROBE AND PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THE BLOCK I THANK GOD SAID HE THAT I AM NOWISE AFRAID OF DEATH NOR AM DAUNTED WITH ANY TERRORS
THE FORCES BROUGHT FROM IRELAND WERE LANDED AT MOSTYNE IN NORTH WALES
THESE ANIMOSITIES HAD LONG BEEN CARRIED ON BETWEEN THE RIVAL STATES EVEN WHILE GOVERNED BY A SISTER AND BROTHER WHO CORDIALLY LOVED AND ESTEEMED EACH OTHER
THIS LAST QUOTED AUTHOR PUTS THE FACT BEYOND CONTROVERSY
AND TO ABANDON THEM IN WHAT THEY REGARDED AS SO IMPORTANT AN ARTICLE WAS FOREVER TO RELINQUISH THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND ASSISTANCE
WHENCE BESIDES A CERTAIN PROSPECT OF THE SAME CONSEQUENCE THEY HAD SO MUCH REASON TO DREAD THE SEVEREST VENGEANCE FOR THEIR PAST TRANSGRESSIONS
THE LORD DELIVER ME FROM SIR HARRY VANE TAKING HOLD OF MARTIN BY THE CLOAK THOU ART A WHOREMASTER SAID HE
MONTROSE WITH A DETACHMENT OF EIGHT HUNDRED MEN HAD ATTACKED DUNDEE A TOWN EXTREMELY ZEALOUS FOR THE COVENANT AND HAVING CARRIED IT BY ASSAULT HAD DELIVERED IT UP TO BE PLUNDERED BY HIS SOLDIERS
ESSEX THOUGH MUCH DISGUSTED WITH THE PARLIAMENT THOUGH APPREHENSIVE OF THE EXTREMITIES TO WHICH THEY WERE DRIVING THOUGH DESIROUS OF ANY REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION YET WAS STILL MORE RESOLUTE TO PRESERVE AN HONORABLE FIDELITY TO THE TRUST REPOSED IN HIM
WHO ON PRETENCE THAT SUCH A SUGGESTION MIGHT PROMPT ANNESLEY TO AVENGE HIMSELF IN ANOTHER MANNER ORDERED MOUNTNORRIS WHO WAS AN OFFICER TO BE TRIED BY A COURT MARTIAL FOR MUTINY AND SEDITION AGAINST HIS GENERAL
MANY OF THOSE WHO FORMERLY ADHERED TO HIM HAD BEEN SEVERELY PUNISHED BY THE COVENANTERS
THE DUTCH WERE THE FIRST THAT FELT THE WEIGHT OF THEIR ARMS
IT WAS URGED BY THE PARTISANS OF THE COURT THAT THE HAPPIEST OCCASION WHICH THE FONDEST WISHES COULD SUGGEST WAS NOW PRESENTED FOR REMOVING ALL DISGUSTS AND JEALOUSIES BETWEEN KING AND PEOPLE AND FOR RECONCILING THEIR SOVEREIGN FOREVER TO THE USE OF PARLIAMENTS
HAVING LOST HIS GREAT FAVORITE BUCKINGHAM HE BECAME HIS OWN MINISTER AND NEVER AFTERWARDS REPOSED IN ANY ONE SUCH UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE
RAPTUROUS ECSTASIES SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF STUDY AND REFLECTION
THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED
AND FROM THE SHOCK OF THESE OPPOSITE PRETENSIONS TOGETHER WITH RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY AROSE ALL THE FACTIONS CONVULSIONS AND DISORDERS WHICH ATTENDED THAT PERIOD
INSOMUCH THAT THE FOUR PARTIES OF THE ROYALISTS GROWING NEARER AND NEARER AS THEY ASCENDED AT LENGTH MET TOGETHER UPON THE PLAIN AT THE TOP
FALLING UPON HIS KNEES WITH EYES ELEVATED AND ARMS EXPANDED HE UTTERED THESE WORDS
IT WAS AGREED THAT THE SCOTTISH AND PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS SHOULD GIVE IN THEIR DEMANDS WITH REGARD TO THREE IMPORTANT ARTICLES RELIGION THE MILITIA AND IRELAND
IT WAS ENACTED THAT IF THE CHANCELLOR WHO WAS FIRST BOUND UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES FAILED TO ISSUE WRITS BY THE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER IN EVERY THIRD YEAR ANY TWELVE OR MORE OF THE PEERS SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO EXERT THIS AUTHORITY
THE BULK OF THAT GENEROUS TRAIN OF NOBILITY AND GENTRY WHO NOW ATTENDED THE KING IN HIS DISTRESSES BREATHED THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY AS WELL AS OF LOYALTY
ON THE ONE HAND IT SEEMED MORE PRUDENT TO DELAY THE COMBAT
BUT IF THE DOG HAVE HIS MASTER WITH HIM HE WILL SET UPON THAT MAN FROM WHOM HE FLED BEFORE
AND THE CLERGY IT WAS THOUGHT WERE ALREADY TOO MUCH ELATED BY FORMER INSTANCES OF THE KING'S ATTACHMENT TO THEM AND NEEDED NOT THIS FURTHER ENCOURAGEMENT TO ASSUME DOMINION OVER THE LAITY THE PURITANS LIKEWISE WERE MUCH DISSATISFIED WITH JUXON NOTWITHSTANDING HIS EMINENT VIRTUES BECAUSE HE WAS A LOVER OF PROFANE FIELD SPORTS AND HUNTING
THAT HE THEREFORE ENTREATED THEM IN VINDICATION OF THEIR OWN HONOR IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR DUTY TO GOD AND THEIR COUNTRY TO LAY ASIDE ALL PRIVATE ENDS AND RENOUNCE EVERY OFFICE ATTENDED WITH PROFIT OR ADVANTAGE
AND HE NEVER LET IT BE KNOWN BEFOREHAND WHAT CHAMBER HE INTENDED TO CHOOSE NOR INTRUSTED HIMSELF IN ANY WHICH WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH BACK DOORS AT WHICH SENTINELS WERE CAREFULLY PLACED
AND BY USING WELL THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD ATTAINED BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE HE HAS LESSENED IF NOT OVERPOWERED OUR DETESTATION OF HIS ENORMITIES BY OUR ADMIRATION OF HIS SUCCESS AND OF HIS GENIUS
CROMWELL PRETENDED TO RETALIATE BY THIS SEVERE EXECUTION THE CRUELTY OF THE IRISH MASSACRE
BUT WHILST OUR THOUGHTS WERE TAKEN UP WITH THIS SUBJECT THERE CAME A LETTER TO US FROM ONE OF OUR SPIES WHO WAS OF THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER ACQUAINTING US THAT OUR FINAL DOOM WAS DECREED THAT VERY DAY
TO THEIR ASSISTANCE DID THE INDEPENDENT PARTY AMONG THE COMMONS CHIEFLY TRUST IN THEIR PROJECTS FOR ACQUIRING THE ASCENDANT OVER THEIR ANTAGONISTS
ENGLAND IT MUST BE OWNED WAS IN THIS RESPECT UNHAPPY IN ITS PRESENT SITUATION THAT THE KING HAD ENTERTAINED A VERY DIFFERENT IDEA OF THE CONSTITUTION FROM THAT WHICH BEGAN IN GENERAL TO PREVAIL AMONG HIS SUBJECTS
BY HIS SAGACITY HE SOON PERCEIVED THAT THE COMMONS NOT CONTENT WITH CORRECTING THE ABUSES OF GOVERNMENT WERE CARRIED BY THE NATURAL CURRENT OF POWER AND POPULARITY INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME AND WERE COMMITTING VIOLATIONS NO LESS DANGEROUS THAN THE FORMER UPON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
A PROPOSAL WILLINGLY EMBRACED BY THAT NATION WHO WERE NOW SURE OF TREATING WITH ADVANTAGE IN A PLACE WHERE THE KING THEY FORESAW WOULD BE IN A MANNER A PRISONER IN THE MIDST OF HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES AND THEIR DETERMINED FRIENDS CLARENDON VOL
THEY WERE ALSO PUT IN PRACTICE DURING THE TIME THAT HE RULED WITHOUT PARLIAMENTS
HE OBSERVED THE INDELIBLE REPROACH WHICH WOULD FALL UPON THE NATION IF THAT UNFORTUNATE QUEEN SHOULD SUFFER ANY VIOLENCE FROM THE MISGUIDED ZEAL OF THE PEOPLE
TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS
MONTROSE THEN HASTENED TO OXFORD WHERE HIS INVECTIVES AGAINST HAMILTON'S TREACHERY CONCURRING WITH THE GENERAL PREPOSSESSION AND SUPPORTED BY THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT OF HIS COUNSELS WERE ENTERTAINED WITH UNIVERSAL PROBATION
HE WAS PLEASED THAT THE SUPERIOR LENITY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION SHOULD IN EVERY THING BE REMARKED
FOUR YEARS A FEW DAYS EXCEPTED WERE NOW ELAPSED SINCE THE KING FIRST ERECTED HIS STANDARD AT NOTTINGHAM SO LONG HAD THE BRITISH NATIONS BY CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS QUARRELS BEEN OCCUPIED IN SHEDDING THEIR OWN BLOOD AND LAYING WASTE THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY
LUCAS WAS FIRST SHOT
P 783
BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR
TO SUCH A CONDITION WAS REDUCED IN THE MIDST OF PARIS A QUEEN OF ENGLAND AND DAUGHTER OF HENRY IV
AND MENTIONED THE NAMES OF PYM HAMBDEN VANE AS A JUST PARALLEL TO THOSE OF CATO BRUTUS CASSIUS
THEY ASSERTED THAT THEIR OFFICERS AS MUCH AS ANY PART OF THE CHURCH OR STATE NEEDED REFORMATION
THOUGH THEY EVEN VENTURED ONCE TO REJECT IT
THE MOST FAITHFUL OF HIS ADHERENTS BETWEEN SORROW AND INDIGNATION WERE CONFOUNDED WITH REFLECTIONS ON WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS LIKELY TO FOLLOW
IN THIS SEDITION THE ACTORS WERE OF SOME BETTER CONDITION THAN IN THE FORMER
VANE AND LILBURN WHOSE CREDIT WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND LEVELLERS HE DREADED WERE INDEED FOR SOME TIME CONFINED TO PRISON
BY SOME COMPUTATIONS THOSE WHO PERISHED BY ALL THESE CRUELTIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
WITH AN ARMY OF ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND MEN CROMWELL FELL UPON WORCESTER
ON PRETENCE OF INJURIES OF WHICH THE ENGLISH MERCHANTS COMPLAINED THEY ISSUED LETTERS OF REPRISAL UPON THE FRENCH
I SHALL FIRST REMARK THAT THIS IMPUTATION SEEMS TO BE OF A LATER GROWTH THAN HIS OWN AGE
LAUD TOOK CARE BY A DECREE WHICH WAS PASSED IN THE COURT OF EXCHEQUER AND WHICH WAS MUCH COMPLAINED OF TO ABOLISH THIS SOCIETY AND TO STOP THEIR PROGRESS IT WAS HOWEVER STILL OBSERVED THAT THROUGHOUT ENGLAND THE LECTURERS WERE ALL OF THEM PURITANICALLY AFFECTED
AND SOME OF THEM WERE WILLING TO ACQUIRE A SHARE OF POWER ON SUCH TERMS
BUT WILL NATURALLY TO US APPEAR ENORMOUS WHO ENJOY IN THE UTMOST LATITUDE THAT LIBERTY OF THE PRESS WHICH IS ESTEEMED SO NECESSARY IN EVERY MONARCHY CONFINED BY STRICT LEGAL LIMITATIONS
ABOUT THREE THOUSAND OF THE ENEMY WERE SLAIN AND NINE THOUSAND TAKEN PRISONERS
BUT IF PROCLAMATIONS HAD AUTHORITY OF WHICH NOBODY PRETENDED TO DOUBT MUST THEY NOT BE PUT IN EXECUTION
ON BOTH SIDES THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT WITH DESPERATE VALOR AND A STEADY BRAVERY
TILL NEWS ARRIVED THAT A GREAT BATTLE WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE KING OF DENMARK AND COUNT TILLY THE IMPERIAL GENERAL
BUT THEY REJECTED THE DEMAND IN ORDER TO PUNISH THEM A DECREE SUDDENLY WITHOUT MUCH INQUIRY OR EXAMINATION PASSED IN THE STAR CHAMBER PROHIBITING THEM TO SELL OR DRESS VICTUALS IN THEIR HOUSES TWO YEARS AFTER THEY WERE QUESTIONED FOR THE BREACH OF THIS DECREE
AND THIS REVENUE HAD STILL BEEN LEVIED BEFORE IT WAS VOTED BY PARLIAMENT

1638 TO SO VIOLENT A COMBINATION OF A WHOLE KINGDOM CHARLES HAD NOTHING TO OPPOSE BUT A PROCLAMATION
THE PARLIAMENT DID NOT GRANT THE DUTY OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE TO HENRY VIII
HIS PROSE WRITINGS PLEASE BY THE HONESTY AND GOODNESS WHICH THEY EXPRESS AND EVEN BY THEIR SPLEEN AND MELANCHOLY
THEY ONLY ASKED AT PRESENT THE POWER OF DOING IT
AND HIS GENERALS RESOLVED TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES BY THE SAME CAUTIOUS MAXIMS WHICH SO LONG AS THEY WERE EMBRACED HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL DURING THE FORMER CAMPAIGN
HE LAMENTED THE IDOLATRY OF HIS MOTHER AND THE TOLERATION OF IT IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE

IT IS NOT EASY INDEED TO THINK HOW HE COULD HOPE TO EFFECT THIS PURPOSE IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN HIS FATHER HAD TAKEN THAT IS BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
HIS CONJUNCTION TOO SEEMED MORE NATURAL WITH THE GENERALS THAN WITH THAT USURPING ASSEMBLY WHO HAD SO LONG ASSUMED THE ENTIRE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE AND WHO HAD DECLARED THEIR RESOLUTION STILL TO CONTINUE MASTERS
A CONSIDERABLE PARTY DECLAIMED AGAINST TITHES AND A HIRELING PRIESTHOOD AND WERE RESOLVED THAT THE MAGISTRATE SHOULD NOT SUPPORT BY POWER OR REVENUE ANY ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT
THEY ORDERED THE TRAINED BANDS TO MAN THE LINES
AS MANY FROM IRELAND
XL ALL WHICH THEY MOST HUMBLY PRAY OF YOUR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY AS THEIR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES ACCORDING TO THE LAWS AND STATUTES OF THIS REALM
BUT MOUNTED UP INTO RAGE AND FURY AS SOON AS THE CONSTITUTION WAS THOUGHT TO BE RESTORED TO ITS FORMER INTEGRITY AND VIGOR
IN THIS CONFERENCE WHICH COMMENCED WITH DEVOUT PRAYERS POURED FORTH BY CROMWELL HIMSELF AND OTHER INSPIRED PERSONS FOR THE OFFICERS OF THIS ARMY RECEIVED INSPIRATION WITH THEIR COMMISSION WAS FIRST OPENED THE DARING AND UNHEARD-OF COUNSEL OF BRINGING THE KING TO JUSTICE AND OF PUNISHING BY A JUDICIAL SENTENCE THEIR SOVEREIGN FOR HIS PRETENDED TYRANNY AND MALEADMINISTRATION
SO CAUTIOUS ON THIS HEAD WERE SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT IT IS PRETENDED IN RECITING THE LORD'S PRAYER THEY WOULD NOT SAY THY KINGDOM COME BUT ALWAYS THY COMMONWEALTH COME THE COMMONS INTENDED IT IS SAID TO BIND THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH APPRENTICE TO A BUTTON-MAKER
AND HE SEEMED NOT TO POSSESS ANY TALENTS WHICH COULD QUALIFY HIM TO RISE IN THAT PUBLIC SPHERE INTO WHICH HE WAS NOW AT LAST ENTERED
AND TO THAT END HAD ACTUALLY RAISED AND COUNTENANCED TUMULTS AGAINST THE KING AND PARLIAMENT
THE KING GAVE HIS CONSENT
400 401
IF SUPPORTED BY MORE DISCERNMENT HE IS ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY HIS OWN ILLUSIONS WHICH SANCTIFY HIS MOST SELFISH VIEWS AND PASSIONS
AND THOUGH JAMES HAD OBTAINED THE VOTE OF ASSEMBLIES FOR RECEIVING EPISCOPACY AND HIS NEW RITES
THESE MOTIVES SO IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING ENGAGED THE ATTENDANCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS
YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS
THEY HAD ANOTHER TRIAL PREPARED FOR HIM
BUT BY ENLISTING SUPERNUMERARIES THE REGIMENTS WERE GREATLY AUGMENTED AND COMMONLY CONSISTED OF MORE THAN DOUBLE THEIR STATED COMPLEMENT WHITLOCKE P
FRANCE ITSELF WAS CONSTRAINED TO BEAR NOT ONLY WITH THE RELIGION BUT EVEN IN SOME INSTANCES WITH THE SEDITIOUS INSOLENCE OF THE HUGONOTS
SHOULD AN ABSOLUTE SUSPENSE OF JUDGMENT BE FOUND DIFFICULT OR DISAGREEABLE IN SO INTERESTING A QUESTION I MUST CONFESS THAT I MUCH INCLINE TO GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO THE ARGUMENTS OF THE ROYALISTS
THE SADDLE WAS UNGIRT
THE BEST ARGUMENTS OF THE ROYALISTS AGAINST A FURTHER ATTACK ON THE PREROGATIVE WERE FOUNDED MORE ON OPPOSITE IDEAS WHICH THEY HAD FORMED OF THE PAST EVENTS OF THIS REIGN THAN ON OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT
THE PARLIAMENT THOUGH THEY HAD EARLY ABOLISHED EPISCOPAL AUTHORITY HAD NOT DURING SO LONG A TIME SUBSTITUTED ANY OTHER SPIRITUAL GOVERNMENT IN ITS PLACE
HE COULD DISCONCERT ANY PROJECT BY CONFINING THE PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE THE ACTORS IN IT
HIS NAME FOR ABOVE TWO YEARS IS NOT TO BE FOUND OFTENER THAN TWICE IN ANY COMMITTEE
THAT HE HIMSELF WAS THEIR NATIVE HEREDITARY KING NOR WAS THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE THOUGH FREE AND UNITED ENTITLED TO TRY HIM WHO DERIVED HIS DIGNITY FROM THE SUPREME MAJESTY OF HEAVEN
NO COMMANDS THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR SUPERIORS COULD JUSTIFY A WAR WHICH WAS CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL EQUITY AND WHICH THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE HAD NO RIGHT TO ORDER
MANY OF THEM FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO FLY THE COUNTRY

HE ENTERED INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH INCHIQUIN WHO PRESERVED GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE PROTESTANTS IN MUNSTER
GEORGE MONK TO WHOM THE FATE WAS RESERVED OF REESTABLISHING MONARCHY AND FINISHING THE BLOODY DISSENSIONS OF THREE KINGDOMS WAS THE SECOND SON OF A FAMILY IN DEVONSHIRE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE BUT LATELY FROM TOO GREAT HOSPITALITY AND EXPENSE SOMEWHAT FALLEN TO DECAY
THIS FOOTNOTE WAS IN THE FIRST EDITIONS A PART OF THE TEXT FOOTNOTE 6
THEIR HEREDITARY JURISDICTIONS AND THE FEUDAL TENURES INCREASED THEIR AUTHORITY
AND IN PROPORTION AS PRECEDENTS MULTIPLIED THE WILL ALONE OF THE SOVEREIGN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF EXPEDIENCY OF WHICH HE CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE SOLE JUDGE
HE WAS A PERFECT ENTHUSIAST
A RESPECT WHICH WHILE THEY STOOD IN OPEN DEFIANCE TO THEIR SOVEREIGN THEY WOULD IN VAIN HAVE REQUIRED OF HIM
FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH WHITE OF EMER
AND IT WAS EVEN ENDEAVORED TO REVIVE THE FIRST INSTITUTION OF THE COLLEGE OF JUSTICE AND TO SHARE EQUALLY BETWEEN THE CLERGY AND LAITY THE WHOLE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY RUSH
NOR COULD ANY THING BE MORE SERVICEABLE TO THE ROYAL CAUSE THAN TO GIVE ALL PARTIES ROOM TO HOPE FOR MORE EQUAL AND MORE INDULGENT MAXIMS OF GOVERNMENT
780 SAYS THAT BUCKINGHAM LOST HIS POPULARITY AFTER BRISTOL ARRIVED NOT BECAUSE THAT NOBLEMAN DISCOVERED TO THE WORLD THE FALSEHOOD OF HIS NARRATIVE BUT BECAUSE HE PROVED THAT BUCKINGHAM WHILE IN SPAIN HAD PROFESSED HIMSELF A PAPIST
AND AFTER HOPTON PRODUCED HIS COMMISSION FROM THE EARL OF HERTFORD THE KING'S GENERAL IT WAS AGREED TO EXECUTE THE LAWS AND TO EXPEL THESE INVADERS OF THE COUNTY
OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
A DEMAND WHICH THOUGH SEEMINGLY REASONABLE WAS POSITIVELY REFUSED BY THE PARLIAMENT
THAT THE SAME VIOLENCE BY WHICH HE HAD SO LONG BEEN OPPRESSED MIGHT NOT STILL REACH HIM AND EXTORT HIS CONSENT TO THE MILITIA BILL CHARLES HAD RESOLVED TO REMOVE FARTHER FROM LONDON
LORD CAPEL SIR CHARLES LUCAS SIR GEORGE LISLE EXCITED COMMOTIONS IN ESSEX
AND GREAT SUMS OF MONEY HAD BEEN BEQUEATHED TO THE SOCIETY FOR THESE PURPOSES

A BILL WAS INTRODUCED AND PASSED THE TWO HOUSES WHICH RESTORED TO LIEUTENANTS AND DEPUTIES THE SAME POWERS OF WHICH THE VOTES OF THE COMMONS HAD BEREAVED THEM
PARL HIST
WALLER TOMKINS AND CHALONER WERE SEIZED AND TRIED BY A COURT MARTIAL RUSH
AND THE DELUDED IRISH TERRIFIED WITH HIS SPIRITUAL MENACES RANGED THEMSELVES EVERY WHERE ON HIS SIDE AND SUBMITTED TO HIS AUTHORITY
THIS INSTITUTION MAY WITH SOME DISTINCTION WELL SET FORTH OUR PRESENT STATE AND CONDITION
MANCHESTER BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION INFORMED THE PARLIAMENT THAT AT ANOTHER TIME CROMWELL HAVING PROPOSED SOME SCHEME TO WHICH IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THE PARLIAMENT WOULD AGREE HE INSISTED AND SAID MY LORD IF YOU WILL STICK FIRM TO HONEST MEN YOU SHALL FIND YOURSELF AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY WHICH SHALL GIVE LAW BOTH TO KING AND PARLIAMENT THIS DISCOURSE CONTINUED MANCHESTER MADE THE GREATER IMPRESSION ON ME BECAUSE I KNEW THE LIEUTENANT-GENERAL TO BE A MAN OF VERY DEEP DESIGNS
DEATH TOO WHICH WITH SUCH SIGNAL INTREPIDITY HE HAD BRAVED IN THE FIELD BEING INCESSANTLY THREATENED BY THE PONIARDS OF FANATICAL OR INTERESTED ASSASSINS WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS TERRIFIED APPREHENSION AND HAUNTED HIM IN EVERY SCENE OF BUSINESS OR REPOSE
AND IN ORDER TO ENABLE HIM THE BETTER TO RECRUIT HIS ARMY THEY GRANTED HIM THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS TO BE LEVIED BY WAY OF LOAN UPON THE SUBJECT
BUT AS NO COURTS OF JUDICATURE NOW REMAINED EXCEPT THOSE IN WESTMINSTER HALL WHICH TAKE COGNIZANCE ONLY OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW THE KING MAY THENCEFORTH ISSUE PROCLAMATIONS BUT NO MAN IS BOUND TO OBEY THEM IT MUST HOWEVER BE CONFESSED THAT THE EXPERIMENT HERE MADE BY THE PARLIAMENT WAS NOT A LITTLE RASH AND ADVENTUROUS
CHARLES HIMSELF WAS ASSURED THAT THE PERIOD OF HIS LIFE WAS NOW APPROACHING
IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THE TROOPS INTO A REBELLION AGAINST THEIR MASTERS HE HAD ENCOURAGED AN ARROGANT SPIRIT AMONG THE INFERIOR OFFICERS AND PRIVATE MEN
AND SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX WAS APPOINTED GENERAL IT IS REMARKABLE THAT HIS COMMISSION DID NOT RUN LIKE THAT OF ESSEX IN THE NAME OF THE KING AND PARLIAMENT BUT IN THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT ALONE
THE EXAMPLE OF THE SCOTS WHOSE ENCROACHMENTS HAD TOTALLY SUBVERTED MONARCHY
AND FOUND TOO THAT THEIR ENCROACHMENTS STILL ROSE IN PROPORTION TO HIS CONCESSIONS

AND MANY OTHERS OF THAT PARTY SECONDED HIS MAGNANIMOUS SPIRIT
THE GENERAL WAS INTRODUCED TO THE HOUSE
IN ORDER TO WEAN THE SOLDIERS FROM THESE LICENTIOUS MAXIMS CROMWELL HAD ISSUED ORDERS FOR DISCONTINUING THE MEETINGS OF THE AGITATORS
ALL PARTIES NOW REAPED SUCCESSIVELY THE MELANCHOLY PLEASURE OF SEEING THE INJURIES WHICH THEY HAD SUFFERED REVENGED ON THEIR ENEMIES AND THAT TOO BY THE SAME ARTS WHICH HAD BEEN PRACTISED AGAINST THEM

IF WE ENJOY NOT THESE RIGHTS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO RELIEVE HIM
THE COMMONS CARRIED SO FAR THEIR DETESTATION OF THIS ODIOUS MEASURE THAT THEY ASSUMED A POWER WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN SELDOM PRACTISED AND THEY EXPELLED ALL THEIR MEMBERS WHO WERE MONOPOLISTS OR PROJECTORS
IT WAS EASILY CONCLUDED THAT THIS HAT BELONGED TO THE ASSASSIN
BUT SO IMPLACABLE WAS THE HAUGHTY PRIMATE THAT HE RAISED UP A NEW PROSECUTION AGAINST WILLIAMS ON THE STRANGEST PRETENCE IMAGINABLE
THE MINISTERS IN GENERAL EQUALLED IF NOT EXCEEDED THE NOBILITY IN THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE COURT AGAINST THE PRELATES AND AGAINST EPISCOPAL AUTHORITY THOUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HIERARCHY MIGHT SEEM ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE INFERIOR CLERGY BOTH AS IT ERECTED DIGNITIES TO WHICH ALL OF THEM MIGHT ASPIRE AND AS IT BESTOWED A LUSTRE ON THE WHOLE BODY AND ALLURED MEN OF FAMILY INTO IT THESE VIEWS HAD NO INFLUENCE ON THE SCOTTISH ECCLESIASTICS
HATING MONARCHY WHILE A SUBJECT DESPISING LIBERTY WHILE A CITIZEN THOUGH HE RETAINED FOR A TIME ALL ORDERS OF MEN UNDER A SEEMING OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT HE WAS SECRETLY PAVING THE WAY BY ARTIFICE AND COURAGE TO HIS OWN UNLIMITED AUTHORITY
BUT LAUD POSSESSED OF PRESENT AUTHORITY PERSISTED IN HIS PURPOSE AND MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TOWARDS ACQUIRING THESE ORNAMENTS
BUT THE KINGS OF ENGLAND WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THE ENACTING OF THESE LAWS HAD SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY WHEN THE TIDE OF LIBERTY WAS SPENT TO OBSTRUCT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION
IT EVEN PASSED BY A MAJORITY AMONG THE COMMONS THAT THESE PROPOSALS SHOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE KING
EVEN MANY SUPERFLUITIES AND LUXURIES WERE SENT THEM BY THE CARE OF THE ZEALOUS CITIZENS
WHICH AS IT WAS TOO LITTLE FOR HIS PRAISE SO MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN FOR HIS CONQUESTS IF THE SHORT LINE OF HIS MORTAL LIFE COULD HAVE STRETCHED OUT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS IMMORTAL DESIGNS COWLEY'S DISCOURSES
THE KING HIMSELF WAS CHASED FROM LONDON
38 NO SOONER WAS INTELLIGENCE OF THIS TUMULT CONVEYED TO READING THAN THE ARMY WAS PUT IN MOTION
THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION IN HOPES THAT HE WOULD COMMIT INDISCRETIONS OF WHICH THEY MIGHT MAKE ADVANTAGE
GREATER CALAMITIES WERE DREADED FROM THE WAR WITH THESE POWERFUL MONARCHIES CONCURRING WITH THE INTERNAL DISORDERS UNDER WHICH THE NATION LABORED
A GOVERNMENT TOTALLY MILITARY AND DESPOTIC IS ALMOST SURE AFTER SOME TIME TO FALL INTO IMPOTENCE AND LANGUOR
BERKELEY A JUDGE OF THE KING'S BENCH WAS SEIZED BY ORDER OF THE HOUSE EVEN WHEN SITTING IN HIS TRIBUNAL
FAIRFAX HAVING FIRST RETAKEN LEICESTER WHICH WAS SURRENDERED UPON ARTICLES BEGAN TO DELIBERATE CONCERNING HIS FUTURE ENTERPRISES

THE PEOPLE WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR LETHARGY AND BECAME SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER TO WHICH THEIR LIBERTIES WERE EXPOSED
THE PRESBYTERIAN MODEL OF CONGREGATIONS CLASSES AND ASSEMBLIES WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE FINISHED
HE DISSOLVED INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS WHITLOCKE
THE KING INDEED HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM HIS AMBASSADORS THAT SOMETHING WAS IN AGITATION AMONG THE IRISH IN FOREIGN PARTS
WHEN THE KING APPLIED TO HAVE HIS CHILDREN THE PARLIAMENT ALWAYS TOLD HIM THAT THEY COULD TAKE AS MUCH CARE AT LONDON BOTH OF THEIR BODIES AND SOULS AS COULD BE DONE AT OXFORD

THE NECESSITIES OF THE GARRISON WERE EXTREME
1ST AUG
236 GREAT PAINS WERE TAKEN BY THE SCOTS AND THE ENGLISH COMPLIED WITH THEIR PRETENDED DELICACY TO MAKE THIS ESTIMATION AND PAYMENT OF ARREARS APPEAR A QUITE DIFFERENT TRANSACTION FROM THAT FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE KING'S PERSON
THE NATION HAD FALLEN INTO TOTAL ANARCHY
HE CONCLUDED A SUDDEN PACIFICATION IN WHICH IT WAS STIPULATED THAT HE SHOULD WITHDRAW HIS FLEET AND ARMY
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT IF WE MAY JUDGE BY THOSE VOLUMES OF THURLOE'S PAPERS WHICH HAVE BEEN LATELY PUBLISHED THIS AFFAIR LIKE MANY OTHERS HAS BEEN GREATLY MAGNIFIED
TWO OTHER MINISTERS HAD BY FLIGHT ALONE SAVED THEMSELVES FROM A LIKE FATE
LONDON AND ALL THE SEAPORTS EXCEPT NEWCASTLE BEING IN THEIR HANDS THE CUSTOMS YIELDED THEM A CERTAIN AND CONSIDERABLE SUPPLY OF MONEY
AND THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS HOPED TO GAIN MANY RICH PRIZES FROM THE DUTCH TO DISTRESS AND SINK THEIR FLOURISHING COMMERCE AND BY VICTORIES TO THROW A LUSTRE ON THEIR OWN ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS SO NEW AND UNPOPULAR
AND HAVING DECLINED TO ATTACK THE ENEMY'S FLEET HE BROUGHT ON THE ENGLISH ARMS THE IMPUTATION EITHER OF COWARDICE OR ILL CONDUCT
BY A CONTRADICTION WHICH IS NATURAL WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE EXASPERATED THE OUTRAGES OF THE ARMY WERE COMPLAINED OF
BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIENNIAL PARLIAMENTS IT CAN HAVE NO LEISURE TO ACQUIRE NEW POWERS OR GUARD ITSELF DURING ANY TIME FROM THE INSPECTION OF THAT VIGILANT ASSEMBLY
THE PARLIAMENT THEREFORE EVEN IF THEY HAD KNOWN THE KING'S SENTIMENTS IN THIS PARTICULAR COULD NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT HAVE HAD ANY JUST FOUNDATION OF JEALOUSY
BUT THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY HARDSHIP OF WHICH THE NATION THOUGHT THEY HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN
THESE HE EVEN LOVED
BY WHAT HATH BEEN SAID YOU SEE HOW LONG I HAVE LABORED IN THE SEARCH OF PEACE
THIS WAS JOHN MILTON WHOSE POEMS ARE ADMIRABLE THOUGH LIABLE TO SOME OBJECTIONS
27TH 28TH AND 29TH OF DEC

YET WAS HE INDICTED IN THE STAR CHAMBER AS A LIBELLER
THAT PARTY BESIDES THE INDEPENDENTS CONTAINED TWO SETS OF MEN WHO ARE SEEMINGLY OF THE MOST OPPOSITE PRINCIPLES BUT WHO WERE THEN UNITED BY A SIMILITUDE OF GENIUS AND OF CHARACTER
THE AUTHORITY OF THE CLERK OF THE MARKET WHO HAD A GENERAL INSPECTION OVER THE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE MAYORS SHERIFFS AND ORDINARY MAGISTRATES
THE TWO POINTS TO WHICH THE KING HAD THE MOST EXTREME RELUCTANCE
594
THAT HE WAS SORRY TO FIND NO BETTER TESTIMONY OF THEIR RETURN TO ALLEGIANCE THAN THE MURDER OF SO FAITHFUL A SUBJECT IN WHOSE DEATH THE KING'S COMMISSION MUST BE AT ONCE SO HIGHLY INJURED AND AFFRONTED
WITHOUT REGARD TO COMPOSITIONS ARTICLES OF CAPITULATION OR ACTS OF INDEMNITY ALL THE ROYALISTS HOWEVER HARASSED WITH FORMER OPPRESSIONS WERE OBLIGED ANEW TO REDEEM THEMSELVES BY GREAT SUMS OF MONEY
THE PARLIAMENT PRETENDED TO LEAVE THE SEQUESTERED CLERGY A FIFTH OF THEIR REVENUE
MONK WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS WELL ESTABLISHED IN SCOTLAND BEING MUCH ATTACHED TO THE FAMILY OF CROMWELL IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED THE NEW PROTECTOR
BUT REALLY TO BE SPIES UPON HIM AND EXTEND STILL FURTHER THE IDEAS OF PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORITY AS WELL AS ECLIPSE THE MAJESTY OF THE KING
EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR
THOUGH EARNESTLY SOLICITED BY LOUDON TO SUMMON PRESENTLY THAT GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO GIVE AUTHORITY TO MEN WHO HAD ALREADY EXCITED SUCH DANGEROUS COMMOTIONS AND WHO SHOWED STILL THE SAME DISPOSITION TO RESIST AND INVADE HIS AUTHORITY
THE KING DECLINED ACCEPTING THEM AND DESIRED THE PARLIAMENT TO TAKE THE PROPOSALS OF THE ARMY INTO CONSIDERATION AND MAKE THEM THE FOUNDATION OF THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT HE STILL ENTERTAINED HOPES THAT HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GENERALS WOULD BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
AND THOUGH INFERIOR IN CAVALRY YET BY THE MERE FORCE OF CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE HE PASSED OVER THOSE OPEN CHAMPAIGN COUNTRY AND DEFENDED HIMSELF FROM THE ENEMY'S HORSE WHO HAD ADVANCED TO MEET HIM AND WHO INFESTED HIM DURING HIS WHOLE MARCH

AT LEAST ANY PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY
THAT IS ABANDON HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS TO THE MERCY OF HIS ENEMIES BOTH PARTIES FLATTERED THEMSELVES THAT BY THESE MESSAGES AND REPLIES THEY HAD GAINED THE ENDS WHICH THEY PROPOSED THE KING BELIEVED THAT THE PEOPLE WERE MADE SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE PARLIAMENT'S INSOLENCE AND AVERSION TO PEACE
AND CHARLES IMITATED THEIR EXAMPLE IN GRANTING THE SAME INDULGENCE
AND THE COMMONS RESOLVED TO EMPLOY THE INTERVAL IN PROVIDING SOME BARRIERS TO THEIR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES SO LATELY VIOLATED
BUT WITHOUT ANY POWER OF TREATING
BUT RESERVED IT FOR PURPOSES WHICH CONCERNED THEM MORE NEARLY
272 273
THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS SOMEWHAT LAME
BUT HE REFUSED TO RATIFY IT AND COMPLAINED THAT THEY HAD EXCEEDED THEIR POWERS
SOME ADVISED THE KING TO LEAVE THE FIELD
HAVING THUS GOT IT INTO OUR HANDS WE DELIVERED THE MAN WHOM WE HAD LEFT WITH OUR SENTINEL HIS SADDLE TOLD HIM HE WAS AN HONEST FELLOW AND BID HIM GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS

BESIDES INFORMING THEM THAT HE NEVER INTENDED TO MAKE A CONSTANT REVENUE OF IT THAT ALL THE MONEY LEVIED HAD BEEN REGULARLY WITH OTHER GREAT SUMS EXPENDED ON EQUIPPING THE NAVY
AN ASSEMBLY WHICH THOUGH IT MEETS WITH LESS SOLEMNITY HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY AS A PARLIAMENT IN RAISING MONEY AND LEVYING FORCES
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM FORMERLY OBNOXIOUS TO THE PUBLIC BECAME EVERY DAY MORE UNPOPULAR BY THE SYMPTOMS WHICH APPEARED BOTH OF HIS WANT OF TEMPER AND PRUDENCE AND OF THE UNCONTROLLED ASCENDANT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER HIS MASTER JOURN
THE SPRINGS OF AUTHORITY HE HAD ENFORCED WITHOUT OVERSTRAINING THEM
THOSE SUBSIDIES WHICH THEMSELVES HAD VOTED THEY REDUCED BY A SUBSEQUENT VOTE TO A FOURTH PART
AFTER WHICH IT WAS NOT TO RETURN TO THE KING BUT TO BE SETTLED BY BILL OR BY COMMON AGREEMENT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PARLIAMENT THE KING'S COMMISSIONERS ASKED WHETHER JEALOUSIES AND FEARS WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE
THE KNIGHT REPLIED IF HIS MASTER SHOULD JUSTIFY SUCH INSOLENCE HE WOULD SERVE HIM IN THE SAME MANNER OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT
SO ATROCIOUS IN HIS EYES WAS SUCH A DESIGN THAT HE SEEMS EVEN UNWILLING TO IMPUTE IT TO THE COMMONS
AND HE WAS EVEN BELIEVED TO HAVE DECLARED PUBLICLY THAT WHILE HE WAS KEEPER AN ORDER OF COUNCIL SHOULD ALWAYS WITH HIM BE EQUIVALENT TO A LAW
THIS ASSERTION PROCEEDING FROM THE INDISCRETION IF WE ARE NOT RATHER TO CALL IT THE TREACHERY OF VANE DISPLEASED THE HOUSE BY SHOWING A STIFFNESS AND RIGIDITY IN THE KING WHICH IN A CLAIM SO ILL GROUNDED WAS DEEMED INEXCUSABLE WE ARE INFORMED LIKEWISE THAT SOME MEN WHO WERE THOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE STATE OF THE NATION AFFIRMED IN THE HOUSE THAT THE AMOUNT OF TWELVE SUBSIDIES WAS A GREATER SUM THAN COULD BE FOUND IN ALL ENGLAND
THE GUARDS WERE DOUBLED UPON HIM
LISLE INSTANTLY RAN AND KISSED THE DEAD BODY THEN CHEERFULLY PRESENTED HIMSELF TO A LIKE FATE
THAT IN ALL COMMON CASES THE COMMON LAW OUGHT TO BE THE STANDARD OF PROCEEDINGS
IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS THERE WAS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DREW CONSIDERATION AND COUNTERBALANCED POWER AND RICHES THE USUAL FOUNDATIONS OF DISTINCTION AMONG MEN
FOREIGN POWERS OCCUPIED IN WARS AMONG THEMSELVES HAD NO LEISURE OR INCLINATION TO INTERPOSE IN THE DOMESTIC DISSENSIONS OF THIS ISLAND
THE SUPREME MAGISTRATE IN CRITICAL AND TURBULENT TIMES WILL NEVER AGREEABLY EITHER TO PRUDENCE OR DUTY ALLOW THE STATE TO PERISH WHILE THERE REMAINS A REMEDY WHICH HOW IRREGULAR SOEVER IT IS STILL IN HIS POWER TO APPLY
SIR BEVIL GRANVILLE THE MOST BELOVED MAN OF THAT COUNTRY SIR RALPH HOPTON SIR NICHOLAS SLANNING ARUNDEL AND TREVANNION UNDERTOOK AS THEIR OWN CHARGES TO RAISE AN ARMY FOR THE KING
THAT THE STATUTES SAID THE PARTISANS OF THE COMMONS WHICH SECURE ENGLISH LIBERTY ARE NOT BECOME OBSOLETE APPEARS HENCE THAT THE ENGLISH HAVE EVER BEEN FREE AND HAVE EVER BEEN GOVERNED BY LAW AND A LIMITED CONSTITUTION
1658 THE PARLIAMENT WAS AGAIN ASSEMBLED
IN DEFAULT OF THE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMS IN ORDER TO EXERCISE THE MILITIA AND TO KEEP THEM IN GOOD ORDER EACH COUNTY BY AN EDICT OF THE COUNCIL WAS ASSESSED IN A CERTAIN SUM FOR MAINTAINING A MUSTER-MASTER APPOINTED FOR THAT SERVICE COMPOSITIONS WERE OPENLY MADE WITH RECUSANTS AND THE POPISH RELIGION BECAME A REGULAR PART OF THE REVENUE
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PROMISED NOT MUCH LIBERTY OR LENITY TO THE PEOPLE
BUT THE AUTHOR'S MEANING IS DIRECTLY CONTRARY

MONTROSE IN HIS ANSWER MAINTAINED THE SAME SUPERIORITY ABOVE HIS ENEMIES TO WHICH BY HIS FAME AND GREAT ACTIONS AS WELL AS BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A GOOD CAUSE HE WAS JUSTLY ENTITLED
BELLASIS ASHLEY AND SIR JOHN OWEN WERE WOUNDED
BUT THE PROTECTOR COULD NEVER FIND THE BOTTOM OF THE ENTERPRISE NOR DETECT ANY OF HIS ACCOMPLICES
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ACCORDINGLY TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE BUSINESS OF SUPPLY
THAT THEIR OBEDIENCE TO HIM WAS BUT A RECIPROCAL DUTY FOR HIS PROTECTION OF THEM
AND NO RESERVE HAD BEEN USED IN EXPRESSING THE UTMOST DERISION AGAINST THE IMPOTENT AMBITION OF THESE USURPERS
ON ALL OCCASIONS THEY SET UP THE FLEET IN OPPOSITION TO THE ARMY AND CELEBRATED THE GLORY AND SUCCESSES OF THEIR NAVAL ARMAMENTS
AND NOTHING BUT NECESSITY EXTORTED AT LAST THE CONFESSION FROM HIM
NOR HAD HE EVER BEEN REDUCED TO THE ILLEGAL EXPEDIENTS PRACTISED IN ENGLAND FOR THE SUPPLY OF PUBLIC NECESSITIES
FAIRFAX ATTACKED THEM IN THAT POST BEAT THEM FROM IT KILLED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MEN AND TOOK ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PRISONERS AFTER THIS ADVANTAGE HE SAT DOWN BEFORE BRIDGEWATER A TOWN ESTEEMED STRONG AND OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE IN THAT COUNTRY
THE PARLIAMENT HAD MUCH GREATER RESOURCES FOR MONEY
IT WAS COMMONLY ASKED WHETHER CHRIST OR THE KING WERE SUPERIOR
AND IT MAY BE AFFIRMED THAT SUCH PASTORS OF THAT SECT AS WERE NOT PASSIONATELY ADDICTED TO CIVIL LIBERTY WERE ALL OF THEM DEVOTED TO HIM
I KNOW THERE IS NO COMPARISON NOR CAN IT BE URGED UPON ME THAT MY WORDS HAVE THE LEAST COLOR THAT WAY BECAUSE THE PARLIAMENT SEEMS TO GIVE LIBERTY TO ME TO SAY ANY THING TO YOU
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH ON ALL OCCASIONS GIVES MUCH GROUND FOR DOUBT AND SUSPICION

AND HAVING THEIR OWN CONSENT AS WELL AS THAT OF OLIVER CROMWELL FOR THEIR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY THEY NOW PROCEEDED VERY GRAVELY TO THE EXERCISE OF IT
TWENTY POUNDS AT THAT TIME PARTLY BY THE CHANGE OF DENOMINATION PARTLY BY THAT IN THE VALUE OF MONEY WERE EQUIVALENT TO TWO HUNDRED IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
THE FORCES OF THE WESTERN COUNTIES NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMMINENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEIR COUNTRY WERE RESOLUTE NOT TO UNITE THEIR CAUSE WITH THAT OF AN ARMY WHICH ADMITTED ANY ENGAGERS OR MALIGNANTS AMONG THEM
BUT HIS GENIUS WAS FOUND LITTLE FITTED FOR THE CALM AND ELEGANT OCCUPATIONS OF LEARNING
EVERY ELEGANT PLEASURE OR AMUSEMENT IT UTTERLY ANNIHILATED
THAT THE KING SHOULD VOLUNTARILY THROW HIMSELF INTO THE SNARE AND THEREBY GRATIFY HIS IMPLACABLE PERSECUTORS WAS TO THEM AN INCIDENT PECULIARLY FORTUNATE AND PROVED IN THE ISSUE VERY FATAL TO HIM
BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT THENCE ANY ACTION WHICH IN THE EYE OF THE LAW COULD BE DEEMED A CRIME MUCH LESS COULD SUBJECT HIM TO THE PENALTY OF TREASON
AND AN EASY METHOD CONTRIVED FOR CONDUCTING UNDERHAND AND PROPAGATING THE SEDITION OF THE ARMY
THE KING HAVING SENT TWO MESSAGES ONE FROM EVESHAM ANOTHER FROM TAVISTOKE DESIRING A TREATY THE PARLIAMENT DESPATCHED COMMISSIONERS TO OXFORD WITH PROPOSALS AS HIGH AS IF THEY HAD OBTAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY 4TH OF JULY 1644
IT WAS MAINTAINED BY THEM THAT THE PRETENCE OF LIBERTY AND A POPULAR ELECTION WAS BUT A NEW ARTIFICE OF THIS GREAT DECEIVER IN ORDER TO LAY ASLEEP THE DELUDED NATION AND GIVE HIMSELF LEISURE RIVET THEIR CHAINS MORE SECURELY UPON THEM

SINCERE HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS AND HOWEVER MISGUIDED ACTUATED BY PIOUS MOTIVES IN ALL HIS PURSUITS

AND ALL THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NATION TRANSMITTED THROUGH SO MANY AGES SECURED BY SO MANY LAWS AND PURCHASED BY THE BLOOD OF SO MANY HEROES AND PATRIOTS NOW LIE PROSTRATE AT THE FEET OF THE MONARCH
BUT AS THEY HAD AFFIRMED THAT IT WAS CONTRARY TO ALL THE IDEAS OF ENGLISH LAW TO TRY THE KING FOR TREASON BY WHOSE AUTHORITY ALL ACCUSATIONS FOR TREASON MUST NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED THEIR NAMES AS WELL AS THOSE OF SOME PEERS WERE AFTERWARDS STRUCK OUT
THE PRESBYTERIANS IT MUST BE CONFESSED AFTER INSISTING ON SUCH CONDITIONS DIFFERED ONLY IN WORDS FROM THE INDEPENDENTS WHO REQUIRED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PURE REPUBLIC
PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO
THAT NO ENGLISH SUBJECT WHO HAD SERVED AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH HIM
AND THIS EXERCISE CF POWER LIKE MANY OTHERS WAS INDULGED TO THAT ARBITRARY MONARCH
THEY WERE NOT THEY SAID MERE JANIZARIES
HE FOUND THEM IN THE BAY OF SANTA CRUZ DISPOSED IN A FORMIDABLE POSTURE
FLEETWOOD'S COMMISSION WAS VACATED AND THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY WAS VESTED IN SEVEN PERSONS OF WHOM THAT GENERAL WAS ONE
COMPARE ONLY ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONSIDER ITS CONSEQUENCES
THIRTEEN MINISTERS RALLIED ABOUT FOUR MILES FROM THE PLACE AND VOTED THAT THIS VILLAGE SHOULD NEVER MORE HAVE A SYNOD IN IT BUT BE ACCURSED
THEN TO HENRY CROMWELL SECOND SON OF THE PROTECTOR A YOUNG MAN OF AN AMIABLE MILD DISPOSITION AND NOT DESTITUTE OF VIGOR AND CAPACITY
AND IN ORDER TO SPREAD THE SAME SATISFACTION THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM IT WAS VOTED THAT THE LETTER AND DECLARATION SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE PUBLISHED
STANDFAST ON HIGH STRINGER OF CROWHURST

THE RESTORED MEMBERS FIRST REPEALED ALL THE ORDINANCES BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN EXCLUDED

FLEETWOOD HAD MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER
BY THE TRIENNIAL ACT A PERPETUAL SUCCESSION OF PARLIAMENTS IS ESTABLISHED AS EVERLASTING GUARDIANS TO THE LAWS WHILE THE KING POSSESSES NO INDEPENDENT POWER OR MILITARY FORCE BY WHICH HE CAN BE SUPPORTED IN HIS INVASION OF THEM
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT
BUT THE WIND SUDDENLY SHIFTING CARRIED THEM OUT OF THE BAY
THAT THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION WAS MORE ANXIOUS CONCERNING THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAN CONCERNING THE BIRTHRIGHT OF THE FIRST MAGISTRATE
AND REFLECTIONS THROWN OUT ON PYM WERE AT THIS TIME TREATED AS BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE PARLIAMENT PUSHED MATTERS TO A DECISION
SINCE HE NEVER ONCE SAT AS PRESIDENT OR EXERCISED ONE ACT OF JURISDICTION AFTER HE WAS INVESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY SO MUCH COMPLAINED OF IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
CHARLES HOWEVER AGREEABLY TO HIS USUAL PRINCIPLES SCRUPLED TO SIGN THE WARRANT FOR HIS EXECUTION
THAT EVENING THE ACCUSED MEMBERS TO SHOW THE GREATER APPREHENSION REMOVED INTO THE CITY WHICH WAS THEIR FORTRESS
CROWDS OF WOMEN WITH A PETITION FOR THAT PURPOSE FLOCKED ABOUT THE HOUSE AND WERE SO CLAMOROUS AND IMPORTUNATE THAT ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR DISPERSING THEM
AND EVEN BURNED BY THE HANDS OF THE HANGMAN THE KING'S BOOK OF SPORTS
BY THE MOST UNHAPPY CONDUCT CHARLES WHILE HE EXTREMELY AUGMENTED IN HIS OPPONENTS THE WILL HAD ALSO INCREASED THE ABILITY OF HURTING HIM

THE PARLIAMENT COMPLIED WITH THIS DEMAND.[V RUSH
CHARLES REDUCED TO DESPAIR EMBRACED A RESOLUTION WORTHY OF A YOUNG PRINCE CONTENDING FOR EMPIRE
AND THAT WHERE AFFAIRS WERE REDUCED TO SO DESPERATE A SITUATION DANGERS OUGHT LITTLE TO BE REGARDED
ADVANTAGES WITH WHICH A PEOPLE TOTALLY IGNORANT AND BARBAROUS HAD BEEN HAPPILY UNACQUAINTED
BOTH THESE NOBLEMEN HAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON BUT WERE AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED AND TAKEN
THAT THEIR IGNORANCE AND LOW EDUCATION EXPOSED THEM TO THE GROSSEST IMPOSITION
HIS POLITICAL ERRORS OR RATHER WEAKNESSES HAD RAISED HIM INVETERATE ENEMIES
SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY
MEANWHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS OF PEACE WERE CONTINUALLY ADVANCING
AND BY HIS RECENT ABUSE OF IT THE WHOLE WORLD HAD REASON TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF ENTIRELY RETRENCHING IT

NO COMMOTIONS BEYOND A TUMULT OF THE APPRENTICES WHICH WAS SOON SUPPRESSED WERE RAISED IN LONDON
AND MEN THOUGHT A POWERFUL FLEET THOUGH VERY DESIRABLE BOTH FOR THE CREDIT AND SAFETY OF THE KINGDOM BUT AN UNEQUAL RECOMPENSE FOR THEIR LIBERTIES WHICH THEY APPREHENDED WERE THUS SACRIFICED TO THE OBTAINING OF IT
AND HAD FAITH BEEN HERE VIOLATED NO FURTHER CONFIDENCE COULD HAVE SUBSISTED BETWEEN KING AND PARLIAMENT
SOME ACT TO THAT PURPOSE MUST RECEIVE THE SANCTION OF THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
CAP 3
COULD THAT CITY BE REDUCED THE KING HELD THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE SEVERN UNDER HIS COMMAND
IT HAD BEEN USUAL BEFORE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRELACY FOR EACH PRESBYTERY TO SEND TO THE ASSEMBLY BESIDES TWO OR THREE MINISTERS ONE LAY COMMISSIONER AND AS ALL THE BOROUGHS AND UNIVERSITIES SENT LIKEWISE COMMISSIONERS THE LAY MEMBERS IN THAT ECCLESIASTICAL COURT NEARLY EQUALLED THE ECCLESIASTICS
THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THOUGH THE SOLDIERS HAD LATELY DESERTED HIM THEY SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSED THEIR REMORSE AND THEIR DETESTATION OF THOSE WHO BY FALSE PROFESSIONS THEY FOUND HAD SO EGREGIOUSLY DECEIVED THEM
AND THAT NEITHER WITH LESS NOR GREATER STATE THAN HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO MAINTAIN
1263
CROMWELL SAID THAT HE ACCEPTED THE DIGNITY OF PROTECTOR MERELY THAT HE MIGHT EXERT THE DUTY OF A CONSTABLE AND PRESERVE PEACE IN THE NATION
AND IT IS REMARKED THAT THIS CEREMONY WAS THE USUAL PRELUDE TO EVERY SIGNAL VIOLENCE WHICH THEY COMMITTED
AND THE PEOPLE UNPROTECTED BY JUSTICE WOULD RECOGNIZE NO OTHER AUTHORITY THAN THAT WHICH THEY FOUND TO DOMINEER OVER THEM
HE EXPECTED THAT TREDAH LYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF DUBLIN WOULD FIRST BE ATTEMPTED BY CROMWELL AND HE WAS DESIROUS TO EMPLOY THE ENEMY SOME TIME IN THAT SIEGE WHILE HE HIMSELF SHOULD REPAIR HIS BROKEN FORCES
IF THE OBSERVANCE OF ANCIENT LAWS AND CUSTOMS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENT CONVENIENCE OF GOVERNMENT HE THOUGHT HIMSELF OBLIGED TO COMPLY WITH THAT RULE AS THE EASIEST THE SAFEST AND WHAT PROCURED THE MOST PROMPT AND WILLING OBEDIENCE
ENGLAND ALSO IT WAS MUCH TO BE FEARED WOULD IMITATE SO BAD AN EXAMPLE
THE TRAGICAL DEATH OF CHARLES BEGAT A QUESTION WHETHER THE PEOPLE IN ANY CASE WERE ENTITLED TO JUDGE AND TO PUNISH THEIR SOVEREIGN
THE NUNCIO FULL OF ARROGANCE LEVITY AND AMBITION WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH THIS VIOLATION OF TREATY
THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS REIGN NOTHING HAD MORE FATAL INFLUENCE IN BOTH KINGDOMS THAN THIS GROUNDLESS APPREHENSION WHICH WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY WAS PROPAGATED AND WITH SO MUCH CREDULITY WAS EMBRACED BY ALL RANKS OF MEN

INDEED WHAT HAVE THEY LEFT US
GOVERNMENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF A MIXED KIND ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION
THE KING THOUGH LONG DETAINED A PRISONER AND NOW PRODUCED AS A CRIMINAL SUSTAINED BY HIS MAGNANIMOUS COURAGE THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH
YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED ALL WAYS SHALL BE ACQUITTED BEFORE GOD AND MAN
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING MY IMPORTUNITY HE POSITIVELY REFUSED HIS CONSENT
AND THEREFORE IN ORDER TO PREVENT MY BEING CROWDED I HAVE GONE BEFORE YOU IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THOUGH LAUD DESERVED NOT THE APPELLATION OF PAPIST THE GENIUS OF HIS RELIGION WAS THOUGH IN A LESS DEGREE THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE ROMISH
DEMAND HIS PUNISHMENT FOR THE BLOOD SPILT DURING THE WAR

THE VERY WRITS THEMSELVES WHICH ARE ISSUED FOR THE LEVYING OF SHIP MONEY CONTRADICT THE SUPPOSITION OF NECESSITY AND PRETEND ONLY THAT THE SEAS ARE INFESTED WITH PIRATES
THE COUNTENANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT WITH WHICH THEY HAD HONORED IT
THAT ARGYLE NOT DARING SO FAR TO OPPOSE THE BENT OF THE NATION AS TO THROW OFF ALL ALLEGIANCE TO HIS SOVEREIGN HAD EMBRACED THIS EXPEDIENT BY WHICH HE HOPED TO MAKE CHARLES DETHRONE HIMSELF AND REFUSE A KINGDOM WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM
BECAUSE IF ATTENDED WITH WEAK JUDGMENT HE IS EXPOSED TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF OTHERS
THE PROMISCUOUS CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE RESTRAINED
IT WAS COMMANDED BY PEN AND CARRIED ON BOARD FOUR THOUSAND MEN UNDER THE COMMAND OF VENABLES
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WAS AT THAT TIME FALLEN INTO GREAT DISTRESS BY THE PROGRESS OF THE ROYAL ARMS

MANY WERE THE VIRTUES AND TALENTS OF THIS EMINENT PERSONAGE
BUT WHAT CHIEFLY DETERMINED HIM TO COMPLY WAS THE ACCOUNT BROUGHT HIM OF THE FATE OF MONTROSE WHO WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF RAGE AND CONTUMELY HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH BY HIS ZEALOUS COUNTRYMEN
BUT HE CONSIDERED THIS SERVICE AS A STEP ONLY TO MORE IMPORTANT SERVICES WHICH IT WAS THEIR PART TO RENDER TO THE NATION
THE INVASION FROM SCOTLAND WAS ATTENDED WITH CONSEQUENCES OF MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE
THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
AND HE HIMSELF ESCAPED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY TO OXFORD

AND AS IT HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE OF JAMES CONTINUED BY CHARLES TO GRACE ENGLISH GENTLEMEN WITH SCOTTISH TITLES ALL THE DETERMINATIONS OF PARLIAMENT IT WAS TO BE FEARED WOULD IN TIME DEPEND UPON THE PRINCE BY MEANS OF THESE VOTES OF FOREIGNERS WHO HAD NO INTEREST OR PROPERTY IN THE NATION
IT IS CERTAIN THAT LIBERTY REAPED MIGHTY ADVANTAGES FROM THESE CONTROVERSIES AND INQUIRIES

TO WHICH IN THE EYES OF ALL MEN HE GAVE BY HIS PRESENCE A NEW LUSTRE AND AUTHORITY
AND THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY HAD GIVEN NO ORDERS TO THEIR ADMIRAL TO OFFER ANY VIOLENCE TO THE ENGLISH BUT WOULD SEVERELY PUNISH HIM IF THEY FOUND UPON INQUIRY THAT HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF AN ACTION WHICH THEY SO MUCH DISAPPROVED
AND EVEN EXPRESSED A DESIRE OF ASSUMING THE RANK OF KING WHICH HE HAD CONTRIBUTED WITH SUCH SEEMING ZEAL TO ABOLISH THE LITTLE POPULARITY AND CREDIT ACQUIRED BY THE REPUBLICANS FURTHER STIMULATED THE AMBITION OF THIS ENTERPRISING POLITICIAN
THEY WERE READY TO BREAK OUT INTO ANY NEW DISORDER WHEREVER THEY HAD THE PROSPECT OF A LIKE SANCTION AND AUTHORITY
THE PLAY-HAUNTERS LITTLE BETTER THAN INCARNATE DEVILS
THUS PERISHED IN THE THIRTY-EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE THE GALLANT MARQUIS OF MONTROSE

HIS SENTENCE WAS AFTERWARDS REMITTED BY THE KING SEE NOTE L AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND NEAR FIFTEEN HUNDRED VESSELS IT IS COMPUTED FELL IN A FEW YEARS INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
AS IF CONSCIOUS OF THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH THE PROSECUTION HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
AND STILL LESS OF A FORMAL DESIGN TO SUBVERT THE CONSTITUTION
AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE ANCIENT CEREMONIES TO WHICH MEN HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND WHICH HAD BEEN SANCTIFIED BY THE PRACTICE OF THE FIRST REFORMERS COULD BE RETAINED IN DIVINE SERVICE
A LIVELY INSTANCE OF THAT SPECIES OF CHARACTER SO FREQUENTLY TO BE MET WITH
THESE WERE CASHIERED WITH IGNOMINY BY SENTENCE OF A COURT MARTIAL
A DECLARATION WAS ALSO MADE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OTHER HOUSE SHOULD NOWISE PREJUDICE THE RIGHT OF SUCH OF THE ANCIENT PEERS AS HAD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR ADHERED TO THE PARLIAMENT
AND CHARLES FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF ACQUIRING FRIENDS BY THE HONORS AND OFFICES WHICH HE SHOULD BESTOW HE SHOULD ONLY ARM HIS ENEMIES WITH MORE POWER TO HURT HIM
A NEW FLEET WAS MANNED AND SENT OUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF WAR WICK TO OPPOSE THE REVOLTED SHIPS OF WHICH THE PRINCE HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND
FOR THIS SLANDER AGAINST THE ARCHBISHOP HE WAS CONDEMNED IN THE STAR CHAMBER TO BE FINED ONE THOUSAND POUNDS TO BE COMMITTED TO PRISON TO BE BOUND TO HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR DURING LIFE TO BE WHIPPED AND TO BE SET ON THE PILLORY AT WESTMINSTER AND IN THREE OTHER TOWNS IN ENGLAND

GAVE TO THE MARQUIS OF ANTRIM AS IF HE HAD ACTED BY HIS FATHER'S COMMISSION
ON THIS GROUND OR PRETENCE DID THE FIRST COMMOTIONS BEGIN IN THE ARMY
BY THE MOST MODERATE COMPUTATION,[V IT APPEARS THAT ABOVE ONE HALF OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY HAD BEEN TURNED OUT TO BEGGARY AND WANT FOR NO OTHER CRIME THAN THEIR ADHERING TO THE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN EDUCATED AND FOR THEIR ATTACHMENT TO THOSE LAWS UNDER WHOSE COUNTENANCE THEY HAD AT FIRST EMBRACED THAT PROFESSION
THE WHOLE SOVEREIGN POWER BEING THUS IN A MANNER TRANSFERRED TO THE COMMONS AND THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT ANY SEEMING VIOLENCE OR DISORDER BEING CHANGED IN A MOMENT FROM A MONARCHY ALMOST ABSOLUTE TO A PURE DEMOCRACY THE POPULAR LEADERS SEEMED WILLING FOR SOME TIME TO SUSPEND THEIR ACTIVE VIGOR AND TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR AUTHORITY ERE THEY PROCEEDED TO ANY VIOLENT EXERCISE OF IT
A READY COMPLIANCE WAS FEIGNED
AND BEING AVERSE TO THE GLOOMY SPIRIT OF THE PURITANS WAS REPRESENTED BY THEM AS TENDING TOWARDS THE ABOMINATIONS OF ANTICHRIST

WHAT CAN BE MORE EXTRAORDINARY IT IS SAID THAN THAT A PERSON OF PRIVATE BIRTH AND EDUCATION NO FORTUNE NO EMINENT QUALITIES OF BODY WHICH HAVE SOMETIMES NOR SHINING TALENTS OF MIND WHICH HAVE OFTEN RAISED MEN TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITIES SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO ATTEMPT AND THE ABILITIES TO EXECUTE SO GREAT A DESIGN AS THE SUBVERTING ONE OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND BEST ESTABLISHED MONARCHIES IN THE WORLD

AND HAD SAID THAT HAVING NOW NOTHING LEFT HIM BUT HIS HONOR THIS LAST POSSESSION HE WAS RESOLVED STEADILY TO PRESERVE AND RATHER TO PERISH THAN YIELD ANY FURTHER TO THE PRETENSIONS OF HIS ENEMIES BUT BY THE UNANIMOUS DESIRE OF THE COUNSELLORS HE WAS PREVAILED ON TO EMBRACE SOUTHAMPTON'S ADVICE
THEY OPENLY DECLARED THEIR INTENTION OF MAKING A GREAT REDUCTION OF THE REMAINDER IT WAS EVEN IMAGINED THAT ANOTHER NEW MODEL OF THE ARMY WAS PROJECTED IN ORDER TO REGAIN TO THE PRESBYTERIANS THAT SUPERIORITY WHICH THEY HAD SO IMPRUDENTLY LOST BY THE FORMER FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN WERE ONLY INTENDED TO BE KEPT UP

AND NO INTERCOURSE EITHER BY LETTERS OR CONVERSATION WAS ALLOWED HIM WITH ANY ONE ON WHOM HE COULD DEPEND OR WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF ANY ATTACHMENT TOWARDS HIM

BUT THAT ABLE POLITICIAN HAD OTHER VIEWS
CHARLES KNEW TO HOW LITTLE PURPOSE HE SHOULD URGE THESE REASONS AGAINST THE PRESENT FURY OF THE COMMONS
NOR WOULD HE HAVE HAZARDED HIS ILL-ACQUIRED AND UNSETTLED POWER BY PROVOKING FOREIGN ENEMIES WHO MIGHT LEND ASSISTANCE TO DOMESTIC FACTION AND OVERTURN HIS TOTTERING THRONE
THE INCIDENTS ARE NEITHER NUMEROUS NOR ILLUSTRIOUS
THAT GENTLEMAN AND HIS SON PARTLY FROM A JEALOUSY ENTERTAINED OF LORD FAIRFAX PARTLY REPENTING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENTS AGAINST THE KING HAD ENTERED INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH NEWCASTLE AND HAD EXPRESSED AN INTENTION OF DELIVERING HULL INTO HIS HANDS
THIS TERM WAS NEWLY COME INTO VOGUE AND EXPRESSED A DEGREE AND SPECIES OF GUILT NOT EXACTLY KNOWN OR ASCERTAINED

AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT DURING ALL THE SEVERE INQUIRIES CARRIED ON AGAINST THE CONDUCT OF MINISTERS AND PRELATES THE MILD AND PRUDENT VIRTUES OF THIS MAN WHO BORE BOTH THESE INVIDIOUS CHARACTERS REMAINED UNMOLESTED IT WAS INTENDED THAT BEDFORD A POPULAR MAN OF GREAT AUTHORITY AS WELL AS WISDOM AND MODERATION SHOULD SUCCEED JUXON
CROMWELL FOLLOWED HIS ADVANTAGE

ALL THE EXTERIOR SYMBOLS OF SOVEREIGNTY WERE WITHDRAWN AND HIS ATTENDANTS HAD ORDERS TO SERVE HIM WITHOUT CEREMONY
FROM POISON AS IS SUPPOSED WHICH HE HAD VOLUNTARILY TAKEN
HE FOUND MEANS HOWEVER SOON AFTER TO CONVEY A LETTER TO THE KING
HEARING OF PARTIES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND BEING INFORMED THAT THE MINORITY WERE FRIENDS TO THE ARMY THE MAJORITY ENEMIES THE TROOPS NATURALLY INTERESTED THEMSELVES IN THAT DANGEROUS DISTINCTION AND WERE EAGER TO GIVE THE SUPERIORITY TO THEIR PARTISANS
AND HAVING AGREED TO A PACIFICATION WITH DENMARK HE RETIRED INTO HIS OWN COUNTRY WHERE HE SOON AFTER DIED

DURING THE LATE CONVULSIONS THE PAYMENT OF TAXES HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
THIS LOSS WHICH THREW SOME BLEMISH ON THE MILITARY CHARACTER OF ORMOND WAS IRREPARABLE TO THE ROYAL CAUSE

IF THE FRENCH MINISTRY HAD THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO BEND UNDER THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT THEY DEEMED IT STILL MORE NECESSARY TO PAY DEFERENCE TO THE PROTECTOR WHEN HE ASSUMED THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT
THEY INSISTED THAT THESE MEMBERS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE SEQUESTERED FROM PARLIAMENT AND BE THROWN INTO PRISON THE COMMONS REPLIED THAT THEY COULD NOT UPON A GENERAL CHARGE PROCEED SO FAR.[V THE ARMY OBSERVED TO THEM THAT THE CASES OF STRAFFORD AND LAUD WERE DIRECT PRECEDENTS FOR THAT PURPOSE.[V AT LAST THE ELEVEN MEMBERS THEMSELVES NOT TO GIVE OCCASION FOR DISCORD BEGGED LEAVE TO RETIRE FROM THE HOUSE
FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL AFTER THE SURRENDER OF BRISTOL HAVING DIVIDED THEIR FORCES THE FORMER MARCHED WESTWARDS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE CONQUEST OF DEVONSHIRE AND CORNWALL

LORD BROGHILL IN PARTICULAR EXERTS HIMSELF ON THIS MEMORABLE OCCASION
THE CHIEF TOPIC ON WHICH HE INSISTED WAS THAT THE COMMONS IMITATED THE BAD EXAMPLE OF ALL THEN PREDECESSORS OF LATE YEARS IN MAKING CONTINUAL ENCROACHMENTS ON HIS AUTHORITY IN CENSURING HIS WHOLE ADMINISTRATION AND CONDUCT IN DISCUSSING EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF PUBLIC GOVERNMENT AND IN THEIR INDIRECT BARGAINING AND CONTRACTING WITH THEIR KING FOR SUPPLY
395
HE SECRETLY FORMED A COMBINATION AMONG THE CATHOLICS
THE APPROACH OF THE WINTER SEASON AND AN AGUE WHICH SEIZED CROMWELL KEPT HIM FROM PUSHING THE VICTORY ANY FURTHER
AND IF SUCH MAXIMS AND SUCH PRACTICES PREVAIL WHAT HAS BECOME OF NATIONAL LIBERTY
BUT THE DISPOSAL OF THIS MONEY WAS NO LESS THE OBJECT OF GENERAL COMPLAINT AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT THAN THE LEVYING OF IT
BY HER SENSE AND SPIRIT AS WELL AS BY HER BEAUTY SHE JUSTIFIED THE FONDNESS OF HER HUSBAND
THEY VOTED EPISCOPACY TO BE UNLAWFUL IN THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND
THERE ARE ALSO INSTANCES IN THE REIGN OF JAMES
250
AND SUCH AS BORE AN AFFECTION TO THE ROYAL CAUSE WERE TERRIFIED BY THE ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY
HAMILTON A NOBLEMAN OF BRAVERY AND HONOR WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED
CATALONIA COMPLAINING OF VIOLATED PRIVILEGES HAD REVOLTED TO FRANCE
THUS FELL SUDDENLY AND FROM AN ENORMOUS HEIGHT BUT BY A RARE FORTUNE WITHOUT ANY HURT OR INJURY THE FAMILY OF THE CROMWELLS
HIS POLICY HOWEVER HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT
THE MUSTERMASTER HAS NO OTHER LIST THAN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF ST MATTHEW THE BROTHER OF THIS PRAISE-GOD BAREBONE HAD FOR NAME IF CHRIST HAD NOT DIED FOR YOU YOU HAD BEEN DAMNED BAREBONE BUT THE PEOPLE TIRED OF THIS LONG NAME RETAINED ONLY THE LAST WORD AND COMMONLY GAVE HIM THE APPELLATION OF DAMN'D BAREBONE
THE SITUATION OF PORTUGAL OBLIGED THAT COURT TO ACQUIESCE
THE UPPER HOUSE SENT DOWN TERMS OF ACCOMMODATION MORE MODERATE THAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN INSISTED ON
BUT TO PRODUCE SO VIOLENT AN EFFECT AND SO HAZARDOUS TO EVERY COMMUNITY AN ORDINARY DANGER OR DIFFICULTY IS NOT SUFFICIENT
PERHAPS THE KING WHO DREADED ABOVE ALL THINGS THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WHO EXPECTED NO SUPPLY FROM THEM ON ANY REASONABLE TERMS THOUGHT THAT IN HIS PRESENT DISTRESSES HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO LEVY SUPPLIES BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEERS ALONE
HOLDING HIM ON HIS KNEE HE SAID NOW THEY WILL CUT OFF THY FATHER'S HEAD AT THESE WORDS THE CHILD LOOKED VERY STEADFASTLY UPON HIM
TRIAL OF THE REGICIDES
STILL THE COVENANTERS AND THE CLERGY WERE DIFFIDENT OF THE KING'S SINCERITY
WHILE THE MILITARY ENTERPRISES WERE CARRIED ON WITH VIGOR IN ENGLAND AND THE EVENT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE DOUBTFUL BOTH PARTIES CAST THEIR EYE TOWARDS THE NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS AND SOUGHT ASSISTANCE FOR THE FINISHING OF THAT ENTERPRISE IN WHICH THEIR OWN FORCES EXPERIENCED SUCH FURIOUS OPPOSITION
LAUD NEILE MONTAGUE AND OTHER BISHOPS WHO WERE THE CHIEF SUPPORTERS OF EPISCOPAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MOST ZEALOUS PARTISANS OF THE DISCIPLINE AND CEREMONIES OF THE CHURCH WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE TAINTED WITH ARMINIANISM
THEY OPENED THEIR BREASTS TO HIM WITHOUT RESERVE AND EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROBATION OF THE FURIOUS MEASURES PURSUED BY THE COMMONS AND THEIR WISHES THAT SOME EXPEDIENT COULD BE FOUND FOR STOPPING SO IMPETUOUS A CAREER
AND IN THE RECEPTION OF IT AS THE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT IS EXTERNAL AND EXPOSED TO THE SENSES IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY WOULD CONSIST
THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY EXALTED ABOVE THE CIVIL EXERCISED THE SEVEREST VENGEANCE ON ALL WHO HAD A SHARE IN HAMILTON'S ENGAGEMENT AS IT WAS CALLED
WHO DESTROYED ALL SUCH STRAGGLING SOLDIERS AS THEY MET WITH AND MUCH INFESTED THE ARMIES DUGDALE P
TO ALL MY AFFLICTIONS ADD NOT THIS MY LORDS THE MOST SEVERE OF ANY
BUT IS AS POSITIVE AND DOGMATICAL AS IF HUMAN REASON AND HIS REASON IN PARTICULAR COULD ATTAIN A THOROUGH CONVICTION IN THESE SUBJECTS
THEY ALSO PURGED IT CAREFULLY OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MALIGNANTS AND ENGAGERS WHOSE ZEAL HAD LED THEM TO ATTEND THE KING AND WHO WERE THE SOLDIERS OF CHIEF CREDIT AND EXPERIENCE IN THE NATION THEY THEN CONCLUDED THAT THEY HAD AN ARMY COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF SAINTS AND COULD NOT BE BEATEN
SHOULD HE SUBMIT TO THE PRETENSIONS OF THE MALECONTENTS BESIDES THAT THE PRELACY MUST BE SACRIFICED TO THEIR RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES SUCH A CHECK WOULD BE GIVEN TO ROYAL AUTHORITY WHICH HAD VERY LATELY AND WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BEEN THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED IN SCOTLAND THAT HE MUST EXPECT EVER AFTER TO RETAIN IN THAT KINGDOM NO MORE THAN THE APPEARANCE OF MAJESTY
THE PROTECTOR HAD OCCASION TO OBSERVE THE PREJUDICES ENTERTAINED AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT BY THE DISPOSITION OF THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HE SUMMONED ON THE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER THAT DAY OF THE YEAR ON WHICH HE GAINED HIS TWO GREAT VICTORIES OF DUNBAR AND WORCESTER AND WHICH HE ALWAYS REGARDED AS FORTUNATE FOR HIM
A LIVELY INSTANCE HOW PRECARIOUS ALL REPUTATIONS FOUNDED ON REASONING AND PHILOSOPHY
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS IT WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU AND US TO DELIVER UP OURSELVES AND ALL OUR AFFAIRS TO THE DISPOSITION OF OUR ALL-WISE FATHER WHO NOT ONLY OUT OF PREROGATIVE BUT BECAUSE OF HIS GOODNESS WISDOM AND TRUTH OUGHT TO BE RESIGNED UNTO BY HIS CREATURES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE CHILDREN OF HIS BEGETTING THROUGH THE SPIRIT ETC
AND HE WAS UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS A MARTYR TO THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND RUSHWORTH VOL
AS IF NOTHING OUGHT TO BE GIVEN HIM BUT WHAT HE SHOULD PURCHASE EITHER BY QUITTING SOMEWHAT OF HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE OR BY DIMINISHING AND LESSENING HIS STANDING REVENUE
AND BY THE VALOR OF THE HEROIC GUSTAVUS THE ENTERPRISES OF THE ACTIVE RICHELIEU THE INTRIGUES OF THE ARTFUL MAZARINE WAS IN PART EFFECTED AFTER AN INFINITE EXPENSE OF BLOOD AND TREASURE WHICH HAD BEEN FONDLY EXPECTED AND LOUDLY DEMANDED FROM THE FEEBLE EFFORTS OF THE PACIFIC JAMES SECONDED BY THE SCANTY SUPPLIES OF HIS JEALOUS PARLIAMENTS
THE GREAT MEN HAVING PROVED BY SO SENSIBLE A TRIAL THE IMPOTENCE OF LAW AND PREROGATIVE WOULD RETURN TO THEIR FORMER LICENTIOUSNESS
SENSIBLE THAT NO JEALOUSY WAS BY THEIR PARTISANS ENTERTAINED AGAINST THEM THEY HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS EXERTED AN AUTHORITY MUCH MORE DESPOTIC THAN THE ROYALISTS EVEN DURING THE PRESSING EXIGENCIES OF WAR COULD WITH PATIENCE ENDURE IN THEIR SOVEREIGN
A MAN EQUALLY SUPPLE AND INFLEXIBLE CAUTIOUS AND DETERMINED AND ENTIRELY QUALIFIED TO MAKE A FIGURE DURING A FACTIOUS AND TURBULENT PERIOD
NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
A CERTAIN PROOF THAT THE RATES OF CUSTOMS SETTLED BY THAT PRINCE WERE IN MOST INSTANCES JUST AND PROPORTIONED TO THE NEW PRICE OF COMMODITIES
BOTH HOUSES TOOK FIRE AT THIS MEASURE WHICH FROM A SIMILAR INSTANCE WHILE THE BILL OF ATTAINDER AGAINST STRAFFORD WAS IN DEPENDENCE CHARLES MIGHT FORESEE WOULD BE RECEIVED WITH RESENTMENT
AFTER MENTIONING ALL THESE FACTS THE KING EVEN CONDESCENDED TO USE ENTREATIES
WHILE HE WAS WHIPPED AT THE CART AND STOOD ON THE PILLORY HE HARANGUED THE POPULACE AND DECLAIMED VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF BISHOPS
BUT HIS GREAT SUCCESS AT PARIS PROVED AS FATAL AS HIS FORMER FAILURE AT MADRID
WHEN IT PLAINLY APPEARED THAT IN ORDER TO AFFORD A PRETENCE FOR THIS TOPIC AND TO SEDUCE THE COMMONS GREAT POLITICAL CONTRIVANCE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED
BUT AS MEN PAID NO REGARD TO THE PREROGATIVE WHENCE THE CHARTERS OF THESE COMPANIES WERE DERIVED THE MONOPOLY WAS GRADUALLY INVADED AND COMMERCE INCREASED BY THE INCREASE OF LIBERTY
BUT SUCH A MOCKERY OF THE UNDERSTANDING SUCH AN ABUSE OF RELIGION WERE WITH MEN OF PENETRATION OBJECTS OF PECULIAR RESENTMENT
830
YOU ARE NO LONGER A PARLIAMENT
614 515
THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
247
247
247
THOUGH HE RELINQUISHED ALMOST EVERY POWER OF THE CROWN HE WOULD NEITHER GIVE UP HIS FRIENDS TO PUNISHMENT NOR DESERT WHAT HE ESTEEMED HIS RELIGIOUS DUTY
AS SOON AS IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE LORDS THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION
BUT CROMWELL INSISTED THAT THE APPEAL HAD BEEN MADE TO GOD IN THE MOST EXPRESS AND SOLEMN MANNER
SINCE IT WAS THE NATURE OF NECESSITY TO ABOLISH ALL LAW AND BY IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE TO DISSOLVE ALL THE WEAKER AND MORE ARTIFICIAL TIES OF HUMAN SOCIETY
THE KING BY A SECOND MESSAGE DENIED ANY SUCH INTENTION AGAINST THE TWO HOUSES
FROM THE FACILITY OF HIS DISPOSITION FROM THE WEAKNESS OF HIS SITUATION THE COMMONS BELIEVED THAT HE COULD NOW REFUSE THEM NOTHING
THE SWELLING OF THE RIVER BY A THAW DIVIDED ONE PART OF THE ARMY FROM THE OTHER
A LITTLE BEFORE THIS BOLD ENTERPRISE A SOLEMN FAST HAD BEEN KEPT BY THE ARMY
THEY HAD LESS INCLINATION TO DISBAND AND TO RENOUNCE THAT PAY WHICH HAVING EARNED IT THROUGH FATIGUES AND DANGERS THEY NOW PURPOSED TO ENJOY IN EASE AND TRANQUILLITY
HOWEVER THEY FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COMPLY
AND YET I BLESS GOD I HAVE THOSE INWARD REFRESHMENTS WHICH THE MALICE OF MY ENEMIES CANNOT PERTURB
HIS LIBERTY WAS AT THIS TIME AS ILL RELISHED BY THE PARLIAMENT
THE CLERGY PROTESTED
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES
THE EARL OF ESSEX A MAN OF STRICT HONOR AND EXTREMELY POPULAR ESPECIALLY AMONG THE SOLDIERY WAS APPOINTED LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
THE MOMENT HIS SERVANTS HAD BEEN REMOVED HE HAD LAID ASIDE ALL CARE OF HIS PERSON AND HAD ALLOWED HIS BEARD AND HAIR TO GROW AND TO HANG DISHEVELLED AND NEGLECTED
THEY WOULD WRITE THEY SAID TO THE PARLIAMENT TO KNOW THEIR PLEASURE YOU MAY DO SO REPLIED JOYCE
A MUTINY AROSE AMONG THEM
LESLEY FOLLOWED HIM AND ENCAMPED ON THE HEIGHTS OF LAMMERMURE WHICH OVERLOOK THAT TOWN
LAMBERT FELL UPON HOLBORNE AND BROWN WHO COMMANDED A PARTY OF THE SCOTS AND PUT THEM TO ROUT WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER
126 127
UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM EXCEPT HERE ONLY WITH US
CONSIDER IT WILL SOON CARRY YOU A GREAT WAY
113
113
AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS AND HAD LEVIED WAR AGAINST THE KING AND KINGDOM PETITIONS FROM ALL QUARTERS LOUDLY DEMANDED OF THE PARLIAMENT TO PUT THE NATION IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE
BALFOUR WITH HIS HORSE PASSED THE KING'S OUTPOSTS IN A THICK MIST AND GOT SAFELY TO THE GARRISONS OF HIS OWN PARTY
BLAKE PRETENDED THAT HAVING GIVEN A SIGNAL TO THE DUTCH ADMIRAL TO STRIKE TROMP INSTEAD OF COMPLYING FIRED A BROADSIDE AT HIM
HIS ZEAL WAS UNRELENTING IN THE CAUSE OF RELIGION
AND WHO DETERMINED TO GIVE HIM NO ASSISTANCE TILL HE SHOULD SUBSCRIBE THE COVENANT
219 220 ETC
BY THE BRAVERY AND ACTIVITY OF RUPERT THE KING'S TROOPS WERE BROUGHT OFF AND A GREAT BOOTY TOGETHER WITH TWO HUNDRED PRISONERS WAS CONVEYED TO OXFORD
EVEN I MYSELF SUBJOINED HE WHEN I WAS LATELY OFFERING UP PETITIONS FOR HIS MAJESTY'S RESTORATION FELT MY TONGUE CLEAVE TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH AND CONSIDERED THIS PRETERNATURAL MOVEMENT AS THE ANSWER WHICH HEAVEN HAVING REJECTED THE KING HAD SENT TO MY SUPPLICATIONS A WOMAN OF HERTFORDSHIRE ILLUMINATED BY PROPHETICAL VISIONS DESIRED ADMITTANCE INTO THE MILITARY COUNCIL AND COMMUNICATED TO THE OFFICERS A REVELATION WHICH ASSURED THEM THAT THEIR MEASURES WERE CONSECRATED FROM ABOVE AND RATIFIED BY A HEAVENLY SANCTION
AND NOW MY LORDS I THANK GOD I HAVE BEEN BY HIS BLESSING SUFFICIENTLY INSTRUCTED IN THE EXTREME VANITY OF ALL TEMPORARY ENJOYMENTS COMPARED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR ETERNAL DURATION
AND THE KING HAD AGREED THAT HE WOULD SUBMIT TO THIS INDIGNITY
WARNED BY THIS EXAMPLE ABERDEEN ST ANDREW'S INVERNESS AND OTHER TOWNS AND FORTS YIELDED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD TO THE ENEMY
AND THE WHOLE NATION WAS RAISED INTO SUCH A FERMENT AS THREATENED SOME GREAT AND IMMINENT CONVULSION
AND THUS CHARLES COULD HE HAVE AVOIDED ALL DISSENSIONS WITH HIS OWN SUBJECTS WAS IN A SITUATION TO MAKE HIMSELF BE COURTED AND RESPECTED BY EVERY POWER IN EUROPE
AND PREPARATORY TO IT A NEW PROOF OF THE EARL'S GUILT WAS PRODUCED IN ORDER TO REMOVE SUCH SCRUPLES AS MIGHT BE ENTERTAINED WITH REGARD TO A METHOD OF PROCEEDING SO UNUSUAL AND IRREGULAR
AN EVENT OF WHICH NO HISTORY HITHERTO FURNISHED AN EXAMPLE
THE COUNTRY PEOPLE DESPOILED OF THEIR SUBSTANCE FLOCKED TOGETHER IN SEVERAL PLACES ARMED WITH CLUBS AND STAVES
AT HIS INSTIGATION THEY DREW UP A PETITION AND TRANSMITTED IT TO FLEETWOOD A WEAK MAN AND AN HONEST IF SINCERITY IN FOLLY DESERVE THAT HONORABLE NAME
IN VAIN DID THEY MAINTAIN THAT THIS MONEY WAS ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER SERVICES UNDOUBTEDLY THEIR DUE
IF THEY SHALL ENDEAVOR TO LESSEN MY REPUTATION AND INTEREST AND TO WEAKEN MY LAWFUL POWER AND AUTHORITY
IN THE KING'S ACCUSATION OF THE MEMBERS THEY PLAINLY SAW HIS JUDGMENT OF LATE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS
THE PIECES OF FOREIGN MASTERS WERE BOUGHT UP AT A VAST PRICE
BY WAY OF REPROACH THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE
HE RAISED A TROOP OF HORSE
THE ALARM MAY EASILY BE IMAGINED WHICH THIS INTELLIGENCE CONVEYED
THE KING COULD EASILY SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS
THIS CONCESSION OF THE KING IT MUST BE OWNED WAS NOT ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY
O'NEALE AND HIS CONFEDERATES HAD ALREADY TAKEN ARMS IN ULSTER
262
ARCHY THE KING'S FOOL WHO BY HIS OFFICE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF JESTING ON HIS MASTER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAPPENED UNLUCKILY TO TRY HIS WIT UPON LAUD WHO WAS TOO SACRED A PERSON TO BE PLAYED WITH
THE GREATEST LIBERTY WAS USED IN ARRAIGNING THIS NEW DIGNITY
60 CLARENDON VOL
THE KING BEING JOINED BY THE PRINCES RUPERT AND MAURICE LAY AT OXFORD WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN
THEIR FATE THEY FOUND MUST STILL DEPEND ON A MERCENARY ARMY
WE MEAN THE LAW OF NATURE WHICH TEACHES EVERY CREATURE TO PRESERVE ITSELF RUSH
AT THE TIME WHEN CHARLES MARRIED BY PROXY THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD BEEN SENT TO FRANCE IN ORDER TO GRACE THE NUPTIALS AND CONDUCT THE NEW QUEEN INTO ENGLAND
THE LAWS AS THEY STOOD AT PRESENT PROTECTED THE CHURCH BUT THEY EXPOSED THE CATHOLICS TO THE UTMOST RAGE OF THE PURITANS
I AM SO MUCH AMAZED AT THIS MESSAGE SAID THE KING IN HIS PROMPT REPLY THAT I KNOW NOT WHAT TO ANSWER
THOUGH HUMANE AND GENTLE IN HIS TEMPER HE GAVE WAY TO A FEW SEVERITIES IN THE STAR CHAMBER AND HIGH COMMISSION WHICH SEEMED NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT MODE OF ADMINISTRATION AND REPRESS THE RISING SPIRIT OF LIBERTY THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
A PETITION WAS FIRST FRAMED
AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS AT BOTTOM AS FRANTIC AN ENTHUSIAST AS THE WORST OF THEM
STILL ANXIOUS HOWEVER FOR HIS COUNTRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE DREADED THE TOO PROSPEROUS SUCCESS OF HIS OWN PARTY AS MUCH AS OF THE ENEMY
DESIROUS RATHER TO PREVAIL BY DEXTERITY THAN VIOLENCE AND PLACING HIS HONOR MORE IN THE FINAL SUCCESS OF HIS MEASURES THAN IN THE SPLENDOR AND MAGNANIMITY OF THE MEANS WHICH HE EMPLOYED
WHICH OCCASIONED A VOTE THAT NO PEER SHOULD HAVE ABOVE TWO PROXIES
IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT IF WE ARE LEFT TO GATHER CROMWELL'S INTENTIONS FROM HIS INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT IT IS SUCH A MOTLEY PIECE THAT WE CANNOT EASILY CONJECTURE WHETHER HE SERIOUSLY MEANT TO ESTABLISH A TYRANNY OR A REPUBLIC
AND THESE HE FORTHWITH CONDEMNED AS PRIZES BY A SENTENCE OF THE COURT OF ADMIRALTY
NOTE U P
AND THUS THE NATION WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED MEANWHILE THE TUMULTS STILL CONTINUED AND EVEN INCREASED ABOUT WESTMINSTER AND WHITEHALL
AND MEN WILL KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION IS ONLY SUSPENDED DURING A PRESENT AND DIFFICULT EMERGENCE BUT HAS NOT UNDER GONE A TOTAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION
MANY OTHERS OF HIS PARTY HE KNEW TO BE EQUALLY DETERMINED
THE PRESBYTERIANS HAD ADOPTED THE VIOLENT MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION
373
NAY HOLLIS WAS SO INDUSTRIOUS TO CONTINUE HIS MERITORIOUS DISTRESS THAT WHEN ONE OFFERED TO BAIL HIM HE WOULD NOT YIELD TO THE RULE OF COURT AND BE HIMSELF BOUND WITH HIS FRIEND
AND FORTUNE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HIS CALAMITIES SEEMED AGAIN TO SMILE UPON HIM
AND THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF REAL DANGER WHERE MEN ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO IT THE FUMES OF ENTHUSIASM PRESENTLY DISSIPATE AND LOSE THEIR INFLUENCE
AND IT MIGHT REASONABLY BEFOREHAND APPEAR DOUBTFUL WHETHER HUMAN SOCIETY COULD EVER REACH THAT STATE OF PERFECTION AS TO SUPPORT ITSELF WITH NO OTHER CONTROL THAN THE GENERAL AND RIGID MAXIMS OF LAW AND EQUITY
WHEN THE SOUND OF WAR WAS FIRST HEARD IN THIS ISLAND MONK RETURNED TO ENGLAND PARTLY DESIROUS OF PROMOTION IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY PARTLY DISGUSTED WITH SOME ILL USAGE FROM THE STATES OF WHICH HE FOUND REASON TO COMPLAIN
THE SPANISH WAR WAS TO AN EQUAL DEGREE PERNICIOUS
AND IT APPEARS FROM WARWICK AND HOBBES THAT MANY ROYALISTS BLAMED THIS PHILOSOPHICAL PRECISION IN THE KING'S PENMAN AND THOUGHT THAT THE VEIL WAS VERY IMPRUDENTLY DRAWN OFF THE MYSTERIES OF GOVERNMENT
131 THIS POWER OF LAYING ON ARBITRARILY NEW IMPOSITIONS BEING A PREROGATIVE IN POINT OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS IN POINT OF PROFIT IT CANNOT BE RESTRAINED OR BOUND BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT
THE STAR CHAMBER WHICH WAS SITTING AT THAT VERY TIME ORDERED HIM IMMEDIATELY TO BE GAGGED
731
86
THEY PRETENDED AUTHORITY FROM THE KING AND QUEEN BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE LATTER FOR THEIR INSURRECTION
THE EARL OF DERBY SIR TIMOTHY FEATHERSTONE BEMBOE BEING TAKEN PRISONERS AFTER THE BATTLE OF WORCESTER WERE PUT TO DEATH BY SENTENCE OF A COURT MARTIAL
AND THE LORD HATH GIVEN A SIGNAL ANSWER
AND HIS PRESENCE WAS HERE LEGALLY EMPLOYED BOTH IN ORDER TO PREVENT OPPOSITION AND TO PROTECT THE HOUSE AGAINST THOSE INSULTS WHICH THEIR DISOBEDIENCE HAD SO WELL MERITED
LUDLOW BY WAY OF INSULT MENTIONS THE GREAT ACCESSION WHICH HE WOULD RECEIVE TO HIS ROYAL REVENUES UPON HIS MOTHER'S DEATH WHO POSSESSED A JOINTURE OF SIXTY POUNDS A YEAR UPON HIS ESTATE
AND MAKING A FURIOUS IMPRESSION UPON THE COVENANTERS DROVE THEM OFF THE FIELD AND GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY IN THIS BATTLE THE VALOR OF YOUNG NAPIER SON TO THE LORD OF THAT NAME SHONE OUT WITH SIGNAL LUSTRE
AND WHETHER THAT RIGHTEOUS DOOM SHALL BE TO LIFE OR DEATH I SHALL REPOSE MYSELF FULL OF GRATITUDE AND CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMS OF THE GREAT AUTHOR OF MY EXISTENCE CERTAINLY SAYS WHITLOCKE WITH HIS USUAL CANDOR NEVER ANY MAN ACTED SUCH A PART ON SUCH A THEATRE WITH MORE WISDOM CONSTANCY AND ELOQUENCE WITH GREATER REASON JUDGMENT AND TEMPER AND WITH A BETTER GRACE IN ALL HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS THAN DID THIS GREAT AND EXCELLENT PERSON
THE TWO HOUSES THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL DUTY AND LOYALTY TO HIS PERSON
THESE ATTEMPTS BECAME A FRESH GROUND OF PERSECUTION AND A NEW REASON FOR THEIR PROGRESS AMONG THE PEOPLE
THE SCATTERED FORCES IN ENGLAND WERE ABOVE FIVE TIMES MORE NUMEROUS
TO STAND ON THE PILLORY IN TWO PLACES WESTMINSTER AND CHEAPSIDE
TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM
565 ETC
AND ENGAGED THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY COMPOSED OF DEPUTIES FROM ALL THE CATHOLIC COUNTIES AND CITIES TO CONCLUDE A PEACE WITH THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND 1643
NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING OVER THEM BUT BY LAYING THE PLAN OF AN OBLIQUE AND ARTIFICIAL ATTACK WHICH WOULD CONCEAL THE REAL PURPOSES OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS
272 SCUDAMORE TOO THE KING'S AMBASSADOR AT PARIS HAD ORDERS TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THE COMMUNION OF THE HUGONOTS
HE COURTED THE PRESBYTERIAN CLERGY THOUGH HE NOURISHED THAT INTESTINE ENMITY WHICH PREVAILED BETWEEN THE RESOLUTIONERS AND PROTESTERS
651
PART OF THESE AFTER ESCAPING MANY PERILS ARRIVED SAFELY TO THE KING
THE ADVANCE OF THE ENGLISH ARMY UNDER CROMWELL WAS NOT ABLE TO APPEASE OR SOFTEN THE ANIMOSITIES AMONG THE PARTIES IN SCOTLAND
UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED
CLAYPOLE HIS SON-IN-LAW WHO POSSESSED HIS CONFIDENCE ABANDONED THEM TO THE PLEASURE OF THE HOUSE
THAT WE DO KEEP THIS CITY ACCORDING TO OUR OATHS AND ALLEGIANCE TO AND FOR THE USE OF HIS MAJESTY AND HIS ROYAL POSTERITY
AND FROM THEM THE CLERGYMEN WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH READING PRAYERS AND HOMILIES TO THE PEOPLE COMMONLY RECEIVED THE REPROACHFUL APPELLATION OF DUMB DOGS STATE TRIALS VOL
A SERJEANT AT ARMS IN THE KING'S NAME DEMANDED OF THE HOUSE THE FIVE MEMBERS
NORTHUMBERLAND HAMILTON COTTINGTON AND JUXON COULD RECOLLECT NO SUCH EXPRESSION
IN OUR TIME HE IS MUCH NEGLECTED
64
AND IF THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT HAD NOT PURPOSELY BEEN DELAYED TILL SO NEAR THE COMMENCEMENT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS THERE HAD BEEN LEISURE SUFFICIENT TO HAVE REDRESSED ALL NATIONAL GRIEVANCES AND TO HAVE PROCEEDED AFTERWARDS TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE KING'S OCCASION FOR SUPPLY
ORMOND HIMSELF WENT OVER TO ENGLAND WAS ADMITTED INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE RECEIVED A GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR HIS PAST SERVICES AND DURING SOME TIME LIVED IN TRANQUILLITY NEAR LONDON
HE WAS HERE INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE AND SHORTLY AFTER DIED
661 681
SOME STEPS WERE EVEN TAKEN TOWARDS AN ABOLITION OF THE CHANCERY THE HIGHEST COURT OF JUDICATURE IN THE KINGDOM
IN BOTH THESE PARTICULARS THE ARMY SHOWED MORE INDULGENCE HE HAD A FREE INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FRIENDS
AND WHILE HE STRUCK MANKIND WITH ASTONISHMENT AT HIS EXTRAORDINARY FORTUNE HE SEEMED TO ENNOBLE INSTEAD OF DEBASING THAT PEOPLE WHOM HE HAD REDUCED TO SUBJECTION
WE HAVE HAD OCCASION IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK TO SPEAK OF THE MANY SECTS WHICH PREVAILED IN ENGLAND
THIS POINT THEREFORE BECAME THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THEIR AIMS
223
CROMWELL BEGAN TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS LEGISLATURE
THE KING WAS ALARMED BUT MADE THE BUTLER PROMISE THAT HE WOULD KEEP THE SECRET FROM EVERY MORTAL EVEN FROM HIS MASTER
BUT HE HAS A BROTHER WHO WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN SUCH A REVENGE THIS CASUAL AND SEEMINGLY INNOCENT AT LEAST AMBIGUOUS EXPRESSION WAS REPORTED TO STAFFORD
THE MANNERS TOO AND CHARACTER OF THIS GREAT MAN THOUGH TO ALL FULL OF COURTESY AND TO HIS FRIENDS FULL OF AFFECTION WERE AT BOTTOM HAUGHTY RIGID AND SEVERE
A POLICY WHICH BOTH ACCUSTOMED THEM TO OBEDIENCE AND MADE THEM LESS HATEFUL AND BURDENSOME TO THE PEOPLE
MONTAGUE WHO COMMANDED THE FLEET IN THE BALTIC HAD ENTERED INTO THE CONSPIRACY WITH SIR GEORGE BOOTH
AND FROM A COMPLICATION OF SUCH OPPRESSIONS INFERRED THAT A DELIBERATE PLAN HAD BEEN FORMED OF CHANGING ENTIRELY THE FRAME OF GOVERNMENT AND SUBVERTING THE ANCIENT LAWS AND LIBERTIES OF THE KINGDOM COULD ANY THING HE SAID INCREASE OUR INDIGNATION AGAINST SO ENORMOUS AND CRIMINAL A PROJECT IT WOULD BE TO FIND THAT DURING THE REIGN OF THE BEST OF PRINCES THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN ENDANGERED BY THE WORST OF MINISTERS AND THAT THE VIRTUES OF THE KING HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY WICKED AND PERNICIOUS COUNSEL
800
DURING THE WAR THE DISCRETIONARY POWER OF THESE COURTS WAS EXCUSED FROM THE PLEA OF NECESSITY
HIS TOWNS HE SAID WERE TAKEN FROM HIM HIS SHIPS HIS ARMS HIS MONEY
HIS PREDECESSORS IN ALL TIMES HAD ENJOYED TOO MUCH DISCRETIONARY POWER
THE COMMONS TOOK THERE SOME STEPS TOWARDS DECLARING IT ILLEGAL TO LEVY TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
TROMP SECONDED BY DE RUITER MET NEAR THE GOODWINS WITH BLAKE
CHARLES X WHO HAD MOUNTED THE THRONE OF THAT KINGDOM AFTER THE VOLUNTARY RESIGNATION OF CHRISTINA BEING STIMULATED BY THE FAME OF GUSTAVUS AS WELL AS BY HIS OWN MARTIAL DISPOSITION CARRIED HIS CONQUERING ARMS TO THE SOUTH OF THE BALTIC AND GAINED THE CELEBRATED BATTLE OF WARSAW WHICH HAD BEEN OBSTINATELY DISPUTED DURING THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS
TO CONVEY MORE QUICKLY THE TERROR AND INDIGNATION AT THIS PLOT THE COMMONS VOTED THAT A PROTESTATION SHOULD BE SIGNED BY ALL THE MEMBERS
THEY HAD REPRESENTED IT AS PRUDENT TO EXPEND THE BLOOD AND TREASURE OF THE NATION IN SUCH AN ENTERPRISE
CHARLES DESPOILED IN ENGLAND OF A CONSIDERABLE PART OF HIS AUTHORITY AND DREADING STILL FURTHER ENCROACHMENTS UPON HIM ARRIVED IN SCOTLAND WITH AN INTENTION OF ABDICATING ALMOST ENTIRELY THE SMALL SHARE OF POWER WHICH THERE REMAINED TO HIM AND OF GIVING FULL SATISFACTION IF POSSIBLE TO HIS RESTLESS SUBJECTS IN THAT KINGDOM
100 THE VERY AVARICE OF THE IRISH WAS NOT A SUFFICIENT RESTRAINT TO THEIR CRUELTY
AND THEREFORE IT MAY BE PROPERLY SAID THAT THE KING'S PREROGATIVE IN THIS POINT IS AS STRONG AS SAMSON
EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS AND STILL MORE EVERY ATTEMPT MADE BY THEIR PARTISANS WERE FULL OF THE MOST INVETERATE HATRED AGAINST THE HIERARCHY AND SHOWED A DETERMINED RESOLUTION OF SUBVERTING THE WHOLE ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT
HE REQUIRED THEREFORE A PERSONAL TREATY WITH THE PARLIAMENT AND DESIRED THAT ALL THE TERMS ON BOTH SIDES SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BEFORE ANY CONCESSION ON EITHER SIDE SHOULD BE INSISTED ON
IN EXCUSE FOR THE TOO FREE EXPOSING OF HIS PERSON WHICH SEEMED UNSUITABLE IN A SECRETARY OF STATE HE ALLEGED THAT IT BECAME HIM TO BE MORE ACTIVE THAN OTHER MEN IN ALL HAZARDOUS ENTERPRISES LEST HIS IMPATIENCE FOR PEACE MIGHT BEAR THE IMPUTATION OF COWARDICE OR PUSILLANIMITY
SOME QUAKERS ATTEMPTED TO FAST FORTY DAYS IN IMITATION OF CHRIST
355
355
THERE WERE GREAT NUMBERS AT THAT TIME WHO MADE IT A PRINCIPLE ALWAYS TO ADHERE TO ANY POWER WHICH WAS UPPERMOST AND TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
THE KING'S CONDUCT SURELY IN SCOTLAND HAD BEEN IN EVERY THING EXCEPT IN ESTABLISHING THE ECCLESIASTICAL CANONS MORE LEGAL THAN IN ENGLAND
AND RUMORS WERE SPREAD OF TWENTY THOUSAND IRISH WHO HAD LANDED AND WERE TO CUT THE THROAT OF EVERY PROTESTANT THE MAJORITY WAS AGAIN TURNED TO THE OTHER SIDE AND ALL THOUGHTS OF PACIFICATION BEING DROPPED EVERY PREPARATION WAS MADE FOR RESISTANCE AND FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELIEF OF GLOUCESTER ON WHICH THE PARLIAMENT WAS SENSIBLE ALL THEIR HOPES OF SUCCESS IN THE WAR DID SO MUCH DEPEND
AFTER THE IMPOSING OF SHIP MONEY CHARLES IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE ALL OPPOSITION HAD PROPOSED THIS QUESTION TO THE JUDGES
WERE IT NOT THAT BESIDES THE GREAT DIFFERENCE THERE IS BETWEEN DARK CROOKED COUNSELS AND TRUE WISDOM AN EXORBITANT PASSION FOR RULE AND AUTHORITY WILL MAKE THE MOST PRUDENT OVERLOOK THE DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH MEASURES AS SEEM TO TEND IN ANY DEGREE TO THEIR OWN ADVANCEMENT
AND WHILE THEY STILL MAINTAINED THAT ALL THOSE ENORMOUS VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND EQUITY OF WHICH THEY HAD BEEN GUILTY WERE JUSTIFIED BY THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED THEM
182
182
NUMBERLESS WERE THE EXTRAVAGANCIES WHICH BROKE OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE
BY THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT TO WHICH HE HAD SWORN NO PARLIAMENT COULD BE DISSOLVED TILL IT HAD SITTEN FIVE MONTHS
THE FORMER PART OF THIS FOOTNOTE WAS IN THE FIRST EDITIONS A PART OF THE TEXT FOOTNOTE 11
380
380
YET WAS IT AN INJURY THEY SAID TO THE REST OF THE NATION TO BE EXCLUDED FROM BEARING ANY PART IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COUNTRY
A SURE PROOF THAT A SECRET REVOLUTION HAD HAPPENED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND HAD NECESSITATED THE PRINCE TO ADOPT NEW MAXIMS OF GOVERNMENT MAY P 21
184 185
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THIS CENTURY SO FERTILE IN RELIGIOUS SECTS AND DISPUTES COULD ESCAPE THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING FATALISM AND FREE WILL WHICH BEING STRONGLY INTERWOVEN BOTH WITH PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY HAD IN ALL AGES THROWN EVERY SCHOOL AND EVERY CHURCH INTO SUCH INEXTRICABLE DOUBT AND PERPLEXITY
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR AS WELL AS IN THEIR WANDERING LIFE THEY PRETENDED TO BE MORE TRULY APOSTOLICAL
A SUM WHICH THOUGH MODERATE MUCH EXCEEDED THE REVENUE OF ANY FORMER KING.[V SEQUESTRATIONS COMPOSITIONS SALE OF CROWN AND CHURCH LANDS AND OF THE LANDS OF DELINQUENTS YIELDED ALSO CONSIDERABLE SUMS BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ESTIMATED
BESIDES THAT LONG ABSENCE HAD MUCH LOOSENED THE KING'S CONNECTIONS WITH THE NOBILITY WHO RESIDED CHIEFLY AT THEIR COUNTRY SEATS THEY WERE IN GENERAL AT THIS TIME THOUGH FROM SLIGHT CAUSES MUCH DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT
1649 THE COMMONS WERE NOT TO BE STOPPED BY SO SMALL AN OBSTACLE
AN OPPRESSIVE METHOD OF LEVYING MONEY BEING UNLIMITED AS WELL AS DESTRUCTIVE OF INDUSTRY
AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS
HE THERE MADE MANY APOLOGIES FOR THE INDIGNITY WHICH TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT UPON THEM
THE OLD EARL OF PEMBROKE IN PARTICULAR WHO WAS ONE OF THEM HE CONGRATULATED ON HIS STRENGTH AND VIGOR THAT HE WAS STILL ABLE DURING SUCH A SEASON TO PERFORM SO LONG A JOURNEY IN COMPANY WITH SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE
ALL THE KING'S SERVANTS SAW THAT NO PROTECTION COULD BE GIVEN THEM BY THEIR MASTER
BUT HE HAD TO DO WITH A MAN TOO WISE TO BE SEDUCED BY SUCH GROSS ARTIFICES
965 967
BUT BEFORE THEY OBTAINED A CESSATION THEY IMPRUDENTLY NEGLECTED THEIR GUARDS
EXIT TYRANNUS REGUM ULTIMUS THE TYRANT IS GONE THE LAST OF THE KINGS
WHEN THE PARLIAMENT MET THEY CHOSE SIR HARBOTTLE GRIMSTONE SPEAKER A MAN WHO THOUGH HE HAD FOR SOME TIME CONCURRED WITH THE LATE PARLIAMENT HAD LONG BEEN ESTEEMED AFFECTIONATE TO THE KING'S SERVICE
THAT THE MINISTERS MIGHT WELL PLEAD NECESSITY NOR COULD ANY THING INDEED BE A STRONGER PROOF OF SOME INVINCIBLE NECESSITY THAN THEIR EMBRACING A MEASURE FOR WHICH THEY HAD CONCEIVED SO VIOLENT AN AVERSION AS THE ASSEMBLING OF AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
SO MANY GRIEVANCES WERE OFFERED BOTH BY THE MEMBERS AND BY PETITIONS WITHOUT DOORS THAT THE HOUSE WAS DIVIDED INTO ABOVE FORTY COMMITTEES CHARGED EACH OF THEM WITH THE EXAMINATION OF SOME PARTICULAR VIOLATION OF LAW AND LIBERTY WHICH HAD BEEN COMPLAINED OF
THEY DREADED THE PARLIAMENT SO FORMIDABLE BY THEIR POWER AND SO PROSPEROUS IN ALL THEIR ENTERPRISES
BY THIS PHRASE WHICH IS SO OFTEN REPEATED IN ALL THE MEMORIALS AND ADDRESSES OF THAT TIME THE COMMONS MEANT THEMSELVES AND THEIR ADHERENTS
DURING LONG INTERMISSIONS OF PARLIAMENT GRIEVANCES AND ABUSES AS WAS FOUND BY RECENT EXPERIENCE WOULD NATURALLY CREEP IN
717
WHILE THE KING WAS PROCLAIMED WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY IN PALACE YARD AT WHITEHALL AND AT TEMPLE BAR
THOUGH IT SOON RECOVERED AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH
HAD HIS AMBITION BEEN VERY EAGER HE HAD NO DOUBT BEEN ABLE TO CREATE DISTURBANCE
SINCE EVEN AFTER THE EVENT WHEN IT IS COMMONLY EASY TO CORRECT ALL ERRORS ONE IS AT A LOSS TO DETERMINE WHAT CONDUCT IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE MAINTAINED THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN AND PRESERVED THE PEACE OF THE NATION
BY DISPUTING EVERY INCH OF GROUND HE REPRESSED THE VIGOR AND ALACRITY OF THEIR COURAGE ELATED BY FORMER SUCCESSES
AN ENTIRE PARITY HAD PLACE AMONG THE ELECT
THESE ADVANTAGES POSSESSED BY THE CHURCH AND WHICH THE BISHOPS DID NOT ALWAYS ENJOY WITH SUITABLE MODESTY DISGUSTED THE HAUGHTY NOBILITY WHO DEEMING THEMSELVES MUCH SUPERIOR IN RANK AND QUALITY TO THIS NEW ORDER OF MEN WERE DISPLEASED TO FIND THEMSELVES INFERIOR IN POWER AND INFLUENCE
THE SAME PROFOUND RESPECT WAS EXACTED TO THE SACERDOTAL CHARACTER THE SAME SUBMISSION REQUIRED TO THE CREEDS AND DECREES OF SYNODS AND COUNCILS
NO SOONER HAD THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES ENTERED THE LINES BY STORM THAN THE PRINCE CAPITULATED AND SURRENDERED THE CITY TO FAIRFAX A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO THE KING IN WHICH HE UNDERTOOK TO DEFEND THE PLACE FOR FOUR MONTHS IF NO MUTINY OBLIGED HIM TO SURRENDER IT
83
83
83
AND EVEN WITH ORMOND'S CONCURRENCE IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT A TREATY SO RUINOUS TO THE PROTESTANT RELIGION IN IRELAND COULD NOT BE EXECUTED IN OPPOSITION TO THE ZEALOUS PROTESTANTS IN THAT KINGDOM
BY ONE HE WAS REQUIRED TO INVEST THE PARLIAMENT WITH THE MILITARY POWER FOR TWENTY YEARS TOGETHER WITH AN AUTHORITY TO LEVY WHATEVER MONEY SHOULD BE NECESSARY FOR EXERCISING IT
THE EVENT WAS EASILY FORESEEN
NEVERTHELESS OF LATE DIVERS COMMISSIONS UNDER YOUR MAJESTY'S GREAT SEAL HAVE ISSUED FORTH BY WHICH CERTAIN PERSONS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED AND APPOINTED COMMISSIONERS WITH POWER AND AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WITHIN THE LAND ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE OF MARTIAL LAW AGAINST SUCH SOLDIERS AND MARINERS OR OTHER DISSOLUTE PERSONS JOINING WITH THEM AS SHOULD COMMIT ANY MURTHER ROBBERY FELONY MUTINY OR OTHER OUTRAGE OR MISDEMEANOR WHATSOEVER AND BY SUCH SUMMARY COURSE AND ORDER AS IS AGREEABLE TO MARTIAL LAW AND AS IS USED IN ARMIES IN TIME OF WAR TO PROCEED TO THE TRIAL AND CONDEMNATION OF SUCH OFFENDERS AND THEM TO CAUSE TO BE EXECUTED AND PUT TO DEATH ACCORDING TO THE LAW MARTIAL
I KNOW NOT BUT THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME I MAY SPEAK TO YOU OR THE WORLD PUBLICLY
AND IN THIS DECLARATION THE SCOTS IN ULSTER AND THE EARL OF INCHIQUIN A NOBLEMAN OF GREAT AUTHORITY IN MUNSTER PROFESSED TO ADHERE
THE PROTECTOR'S ADMINISTRATION WAS EXTREMELY VIGILANT
73
73
73
THIS WAS ALL THE PERSECUTION WHICH IT UNDERWENT DURING THE REIGN OF CHARLES.[V A COMMISSION WAS GRANTED FOR COMPOUNDING WITH SUCH AS WERE POSSESSED OF CROWN LANDS UPON DEFECTIVE TITLES
AND HE PERISHED AT LAST OVERWHELMED AND STILL UNSUBDUED BY THE OPEN VIOLENCE OF HIS FIERCE AND UNRELENTING ANTAGONISTS
TO NO PERSON WOULD THEY MAKE A BOW OR MOVE THEIR HAT OR GIVE ANY SIGNS OF REVERENCE
AND THE ADVICE WAS TOO REMARKABLE TO BE EASILY FORGOTTEN
AND THEREBY ANTICIPATE BY A LITTLE REFLECTION THAT JUDGMENT WHICH TIME BY INTRODUCING NEW SUBJECTS OF CONTROVERSY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RENDER QUITE FAMILIAR TO POSTERITY
PAGE 41
WITH REGARD THEREFORE TO A TREATY GREAT DIFFICULTIES OCCURRED ON BOTH SIDES
BUT WHEN THE SPANIARDS HAD HIRED SHIPS FOR TRANSPORTING THESE TROOPS AND THE MEN WERE READY TO EMBARK THE COMMONS WILLING TO SHOW THEIR POWER AND NOT DISPLEASED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY OF CURBING AND AFFRONTING THE KING PROHIBITED EVERY ONE FROM FURNISHING VESSELS FOR THAT SERVICE
SOME OF THEM STRICTLY SPEAKING ILLEGAL
I DISDAIN YOUR FAVOR
BUT SHIP MONEY WAS AT THIS TIME LEVIED ON THE WHOLE KINGDOM
AND IN THEM TO ANNIHILATE THE PRINCIPAL AND MOST DANGEROUS ARTICLES OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVE
PARTY HISTORIANS ARE SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT IN THEIR REPRESENTATIONS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS
THE ASSESSMENTS WERE LEVIED ON PERSONAL ESTATES AS WELL AS ON LAND AND COMMISSIONERS WERE APPOINTED IN EACH COUNTY FOR RATING THE INDIVIDUALS
THE ANGRY AND ABRUPT DISSOLUTION OF THAT PARLIAMENT IS ALWAYS SURE TO INCREASE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT
THE SCOTS THOUGH DOUBLE IN NUMBER TO THE ENGLISH WERE SOON PUT TO FLIGHT AND PURSUED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER
AND HIS MODERATE TEMPER EXEMPTED HIM NOT FROM HASTY AND PRECIPITATE RESOLUTIONS
THE NEW LIEUTENANT IMMEDIATELY APPLIED HIMSELF WITH HIS WONTED VIGILANCE TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HIS EXPEDITION
299
299
299
HAD HE PROTRACTED HIS JOURNEY A FEW HOURS HE HAD CERTAINLY UNDER PRETENCE OF HONOR AND RESPECT BEEN ARRESTED BY THE SPANIARDS LOCKHART WHO WAS GOVERNOR OF DUNKIRK AND NOWISE AVERSE TO THE KING'S SERVICE WAS APPLIED TO ON THIS OCCASION
AS MANY DIFFICULTIES OCCURRED IN THE NEGOTIATION WITH THE SCOTS IT WAS PROPOSED TO TRANSFER THE TREATY FROM RIPPON TO LONDON
IN THE DEBATES OF THE COMMONS WHICH ARE TRANSMITTED TO US IT IS EASY TO DISCERN SO EARLY SOME SPARKS OF THAT ENTHUSIASTIC FIRE WHICH AFTERWARDS SET THE WHOLE NATION IN COMBUSTION
AND ALL PROFESSIONS OATHS LAWS AND ENGAGEMENTS HAD IN A GREAT MEASURE LOST THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THEM
HIS LEGS AND ARMS BE STUCK UP ON THE FOUR CHIEF TOWNS OF THE KINGDOM
IN THIS FURIOUS MANNER WHICH SO WELL DENOTES HIS GENUINE CHARACTER DID CROMWELL WITHOUT THE LEAST OPPOSITION OR EVEN MURMUR ANNIHILATE THAT FAMOUS ASSEMBLY WHICH HAD FILLED ALL EUROPE WITH THE RENOWN OF ITS ACTIONS AND WITH ASTONISHMENT AT ITS CRIMES AND WHOSE COMMENCEMENT WAS NOT MORE ARDENTLY DESIRED BY THE PEOPLE THAN WAS ITS FINAL DISSOLUTION
THE ZEALOTS IN THEIR TURN INSULTED THE SCHOLARS AND PROFESSORS
HE DIED IN 1667 AGED FORTY-NINE
CHAPTER LIII CHARLES I
THE KING REDUCED TO DESPAIR BY THE FAILURE OF ALL ENTERPRISES FOR HIS RESTORATION WAS RESOLVED TO TRY THE WEAK RESOURCE OF FOREIGN SUCCORS
FOR THAT WAS AS SPLENDID AS THAT COUNTRY COULD AFFORD IT
AND THIS TUMULTUOUS SPIRIT THOUGH IT STILL LURKED IN THE ARMY AND BROKE OUT FROM TIME TO TIME SEEMED FOR THE PRESENT TO BE SUPPRESSED
158
A COMMITTEE WAS ELECTED BY THE LOWER HOUSE AS A COURT OF INQUISITION UPON THE CLERGY AND WAS COMMONLY DENOMINATED THE COMMITTEE OF SCANDALOUS MINISTERS THE POLITICIANS AMONG THE COMMONS WERE APPRISED OF THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF THE PULPIT FOR GUIDING THE PEOPLE
THE TWO ARMIES FACED EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME AND NEITHER OF THEM RETAINED COURAGE SUFFICIENT FOR A NEW ATTACK
THE SAME POMP AND CEREMONY WAS AFFECTED IN WORSHIP
THE FIRST INSTANCE OF THOSE PARLIAMENTARY ENCROACHMENTS WHICH CHARLES WAS NOW TO LOOK FOR WAS THE BILL FOR PRESSING SOLDIERS TO THE SERVICE OF IRELAND
AND THE SAME SUPERSTITIOUS REGARD TO DAYS POSTURES MEATS AND VESTMENTS
THE JURISDICTION OF PRESBYTERIES SYNODS AND OTHER DEMOCRATICAL COURTS WAS IN A MANNER ABOLISHED BY THE BISHOPS
AND THIS ISLAND ENJOYED THE SINGULAR ADVANTAGE FOR SUCH IT SURELY WAS OF FIGHTING OUT ITS OWN QUARRELS WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF FOREIGNERS
THE PROSPECT OF PEACE CONCORD LIBERTY JUSTICE BROKE FORTH AT ONCE FROM AMIDST THE DEEPEST DARKNESS IN WHICH THE NATION HAD EVER BEEN INVOLVED
IN PROSECUTION OF HIS HOLY PURPOSES HE OVERLOOKED EVERY HUMAN CONSIDERATION
A STATION FOR WHICH HE WAS WELL QUALIFIED AND WHERE ALONE HE MADE ANY FIGURE
MEN'S VIEWS OF THINGS ARE THE RESULT OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING ALONE
ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG WHY DOST THOU TYRANT BOAST THYSELF THY WICKED DEEDS TO PRAISE THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY
THE HORSES WERE STARTLED AND RAN AWAY
AND THAT HOWEVER DESPERATE THE ROYAL CAUSE IT MUST STILL BE REGARDED AS HIGHLY IMPRUDENT IN THE KING TO MAKE A SACRIFICE OF HIS HONOR WHERE THE SOLE PURCHASE WAS TO ENDANGER HIS LIFE OR LIBERTY
THEY SECRETLY CONTINUED THEIR MEETINGS
AND DECLARED THAT TILL A FREE AND LAWFUL PARLIAMENT IMPOSED TAXES THEY NEVER SHOULD DEEM IT THEIR DUTY TO MAKE ANY PAYMENT
A PARTY OF FIVE HUNDRED HORSE APPEARED AT HOLDENBY CONDUCTED BY ONE JOYCE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN A TAILOR BY PROFESSION BUT WAS NOW ADVANCED TO THE RANK OF CORNET AND WAS AN ACTIVE AGITATOR IN THE ARMY
IT WAS URGED BY HAMBDEN'S COUNSEL AND BY HIS PARTISANS IN THE NATION THAT THE PLEA OF NECESSITY WAS IN VAIN INTRODUCED INTO A TRIAL OF LAW
AND IT WAS THOUGHT DANGEROUS BY MANY TO INTRODUCE SO NEAR THE TIME OF ACTION SUCH GREAT INNOVATIONS INTO THE ARMY
THESE LIBELLERS FAR FROM BEING TAMED BY THE RIGOROUS PUNISHMENTS WHICH THEY HAD UNDERGONE SHOWED STILL A DISPOSITION OF REPEATING THEIR OFFENCE
WILSON P
URREY WHOSE INCONSTANCY NOW LED HIM TO TAKE PART WITH THE KING SUFFERED ABOUT THE SAME TIME
IN THIS SITUATION IT MAY BE IMAGINED THE KING AND THE DUKE DREADED ABOVE ALL THINGS THE ASSEMBLING OF A PARLIAMENT
CROMWELL RETAINED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CONSTRAINT THOUGH HE PERMITTED ITS CLERGY A LITTLE MORE LIBERTY THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARLIAMENT HAD FORMERLY ALLOWED
MANY PERSONS ALSO ATTACHED TO THEIR COUNTRY DESPAIRED OF EVER BEING ABLE TO SUBVERT THE PRESENT ILLEGAL ESTABLISHMENT
CARTE VOL
COVER ALL THESE TEMERITIES UNDER A SEEMING OBEDIENCE TO A PARLIAMENT IN WHOSE SERVICE HE PRETENDED TO BE RETAINED
THEY HAD ENTERED INDEED INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE SCOTS FOR SENDING OVER AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN INTO IRELAND
IT WAS REMARKED THAT NO PHYSICIAN IN EUROPE WHO HAD REACHED FORTY YEARS OF AGE EVER TO THE END OF HIS LIFE ADOPTED HARVEY'S DOCTRINE OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD
NOT CONTENT WITH CONFINING TO VERY NARROW LIMITS THE POWER OF THE CROWN AND REDUCING THE KING TO THE RANK OF FIRST MAGISTRATE WHICH WAS THE PROJECT OF THE PRESBYTERIANS THIS SECT MORE ARDENT IN THE PURSUIT OF LIBERTY ASPIRED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE MONARCHY AND EVEN OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND PROJECTED AN ENTIRE EQUALITY OF RANK AND ORDER IN A REPUBLIC QUITE FREE AND INDEPENDENT
EACH ACTION OF HIS LIFE BETRAYED THE TERRORS UNDER WHICH HE LABORED
AMONG THE GENERALITY OF MEN EDUCATED IN REGULAR CIVILIZED SOCIETIES THE SENTIMENTS OF SHAME DUTY HONOR HAVE CONSIDERABLE AUTHORITY AND SERVE TO COUNTERBALANCE AND DIRECT THE MOTIVES DERIVED FROM PRIVATE ADVANTAGE
THOUGH HE HAD ACQUIRED A TOLERABLE FORTUNE BY A MATERNAL UNCLE HE FOUND HIS AFFAIRS SO INJURED BY HIS EXPENSES THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE A FARM AT ST IVES AND APPLY HIMSELF FOR SOME YEARS TO AGRICULTURE AS A PROFESSION
LET THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD BE IN THE MOUTHS OF HIS SAINTS AND A TWOFOLD SWORD IN THEIR HANDS TO EXECUTE VENGEANCE UPON THE HEATHEN AND PUNISHMENT UPON THE PEOPLE
FOR HIS DISCOURSE IS ALL OF A PIECE
AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
MOST OF HIS ENGLISH COUNSELLORS DISSUADED HIM FROM ACCEPTING CONDITIONS SO DISADVANTAGEOUS AND DISHONORABLE
THE BAY WAS SECURED WITH A STRONG CASTLE WELL PROVIDED WITH CANNON BESIDES SEVEN FORTS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF IT ALL UNITED BY A LINE OF COMMUNICATION MANNED WITH MUSKETEERS
LAMBERT WAS OPPOSED TO LANGDALE AND MUSGRAVE IN THE NORTH AND GAINED ADVANTAGES OVER THEM
FLY DEBATE ROBERTS OF THE SAME
BY MEANS OF CONTRIBUTIONS OR ASSESSMENTS LEVIED BY THE HORSE CHARLES MAINTAINED HIS CAVALRY
CHAPTER LII CHARLES I
THOUGH RESOLVED TO STARVE ST MARTIN HE GUARDED THE SEA NEGLIGENTLY AND ALLOWED PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION TO BE THROWN INTO IT
245
THE PARLIAMENT VOTED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE NO MORE GENERAL OFFICERS
THE FIRST AND MOST NUMEROUS WERE THE MILLENARIANS OR FIFTH MONARCHY MEN WHO INSISTED THAT DOMINION BEING FOUNDED IN GRACE ALL DISTINCTION IN MAGISTRACY MUST BE ABOLISHED EXCEPT WHAT AROSE FROM PIETY AND HOLINESS
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT DIEPPE THEY FOUND THAT THEY HAD BEEN DECEIVED
AND AFTERWARDS THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HIS OWN UNLIMITED AUTHORITY WITH WHICH HE ESTEEMED THE RESTORATION AND EVEN LIFE OF THE KING ALTOGETHER INCOMPATIBLE
593 594
FROM LOW COMMANDS HE ROSE WITH GREAT RAPIDITY TO BE REALLY THE FIRST THOUGH IN APPEARANCE ONLY THE SECOND IN THE ARMY
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WE MAY OBSERVE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY A SET OF MEN OF THE MOST UNCOMMON CAPACITY AND THE LARGEST VIEWS
AND THEREBY PREPARED THE WAY FOR THE GREATNESS OF THE PRESENT LEADERS WHO AT THAT TIME WERE OF SMALL ACCOUNT IN THE NATION
119
119
119
IN THE SECOND INSURRECTION A GREAT MILITARY COMMAND WAS INTRUSTED TO HIM BY THE COVENANTERS
AND TILL HIS DEATH WHICH HAPPENED IN A GOOD OLD AGE HE WAS THE DELIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
YOUR FRIENDS THE CAVALIERS SAID A PARLIAMENTARIAN TO A ROYALIST ARE VERY DISSOLUTE AND DEBAUCHED TRUE REPLIED THE ROYALIST THEY HAVE THE INFIRMITIES OF MEN
THEY REPRESENT THEM AS SINCERE THAT THEY MAY REPROACH THE KING THE PRINCE AND THE DUKE WITH FALSEHOOD IN THEIR NARRATIVE TO THE PARLIAMENT
THE PARLIAMENTARY AND ROYAL ARMIES AS SOON AS THE SEASON WOULD PERMIT PREPARED TO TAKE THE FIELD IN HOPES OF BRINGING THEIR IMPORTANT QUARREL TO A QUICK DECISION
AND ENDEAVOR BY THEIR COMBINED FORCE TO RESIST IF POSSIBLE THE USURPING FURY OF THE ARMY
MONK CONTINUED HIS MARCH WITH FEW INTERRUPTIONS TILL HE REACHED ST ALBANS
IF THESE REASONS APPEAR TO THE KING SO URGENT AS TO DISPENSE WITH THE LEGAL RULES OF GOVERNMENT LET HIM ENFORCE HIS EDICTS BY HIS COURT OF STAR CHAMBER THE PROPER INSTRUMENT OF IRREGULAR AND ABSOLUTE POWER NOT PROSTITUTE THE CHARACTER OF HIS JUDGES BY A DECREE WHICH IS NOT AND CANNOT POSSIBLY BE LEGAL
THEY PROCEEDED SO FAR AS TO NAME ELEVEN MEMBERS WHOM IN GENERAL TERMS THEY CHARGED WITH HIGH TREASON AS ENEMIES TO THE ARMY AND EVIL COUNSELLORS TO THE PARLIAMENT
DOES NOT THE PARLIAMENT CONSIST OF THOSE VERY MEN WHO HAVE EVER OPPOSED ALL WAR WITH SCOTLAND WHO HAVE PUNISHED THE AUTHORS OF OUR OPPRESSIONS WHO HAVE OBTAINED US THE REDRESS OF EVERY GRIEVANCE AND WHO WITH MANY HONORABLE EXPRESSIONS HAVE CONFERRED ON US AN AMPLE REWARD FOR OUR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
AND ORDERED THEM TO FINISH IN A FEW DAYS THE BILL WHICH THEY HAD BEGUN FOR THE SUBSIDIES AND TO MAKE SOME ADDITION TO THEM
AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FRENZY HE ENDEAVORED TO IMITATE MANY ACTIONS OF THE MESSIAH RELATED IN THE EVANGELISTS
THE EYES OF THE FRENCH COURT WERE DIRECTED BY CURIOSITY TOWARDS THAT MAN WHO HAD ENJOYED THE UNLIMITED FAVOR OF TWO SUCCESSIVE MONARCHS AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH TO THE ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENT OF THREE KINGDOMS
THE LOSS SUSTAINED ON BOTH SIDES IN THE BATTLE OF NEWBURY AND THE ADVANCED SEASON OBLIGED THE ARMIES TO RETIRE INTO WINTER QUARTERS
THOUGH INVITED BY THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO MODEL THEIR GOVERNMENT INTO A REPUBLICAN FORM THEY RESOLVED STILL TO ADHERE TO MONARCHY WHICH HAD EVER PREVAILED IN THEIR COUNTRY AND WHICH BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THEIR COVENANT THEY HAD ENGAGED TO DEFEND
HE TOOK CARE LIKEWISE TO RETORT ON THEM THEIR FAVORITE ARGUMENT OF PROVIDENCE
MORDAUNT WHO HAD SO NARROWLY ESCAPED ON HIS TRIAL BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE SEEMED RATHER ANIMATED THAN DAUNTED WITH PAST DANGER
HE PLAINLY TOLD THEM THAT IF HE MET THE KING IN BATTLE HE WOULD FIRE A PISTOL IN HIS FACE AS READILY AS AGAINST ANY OTHER MAN
THE COMMAND WAS INTRUSTED TO LESLEY A SOLDIER OF EXPERIENCE AND ABILITIES
THAT COMMISSION WHICH WE FIND IN RUSH VOL
ROBINS WHO HAD BEEN AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE GUILT WAS CONDEMNED BY A SENTENCE EQUALLY SEVERE SUCH EVENTS ARE RATHER TO BE CONSIDERED AS RARE AND DETACHED INCIDENTS COLLECTED BY THE SEVERE SCRUTINY OF HISTORIANS THAN AS PROOFS OF THE PREVAILING GENIUS OF THE KING'S ADMINISTRATION WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MORE GENTLE AND EQUITABLE THAN THAT OF MOST OF HIS PREDECESSORS
103
AND DURING THOSE SPLENDID SCENES AMONG THAT GAY PEOPLE THE DUKE FOUND HIMSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE HE WAS PERFECTLY QUALIFIED TO EXCEL CLARENDON VOL
25 CHAP
HE THERE BECAME MASTER OF ALL THE RECORDS OF THE KINGDOM
NO SOONER DID THE KING'S ARMY APPROACH THAN FORTESCUE ORDERING HIS TROOP TO DISCHARGE THEIR PISTOLS IN THE GROUND PUT HIMSELF UNDER THE COMMAND OF PRINCE RUPERT
TO BE SO CURIOUS IN PROVIDING FOR THE QUIET POSSESSION OF OUR LANDS AND THE LIBERTIES OF PARLIAMENT
761
SINCE EVERY INDETERMINATE POWER SUCH AS THAT OF A PROTECTOR MUST BE ARBITRARY
AND WITHOUT DELAY THEY PROCEEDED TO MODEL THE FUTURE ASSEMBLY FROM WHICH SUCH GREAT ACHIEVMENTS WERE EXPECTED THE GENIUS OF THAT RELIGION WHICH PREVAILED IN SCOTLAND AND WHICH EVERY DAY WAS SECRETLY GAINING GROUND IN ENGLAND WAS FAR FRONT INCULCATING DEFERENCE AND SUBMISSION TO THE ECCLESIASTICS MERELY AS SUCH
NOR SHOULD ANY OF HIS FRIENDS HE SAID EVER HAVE REASON TO BLUSH FOR THE PRINCE WHOM THEY HAD SO UNFORTUNATELY SERVED THE MURMURS OF DISCONTENTED OFFICERS ON THE ONE HAND HARASSED THEIR UNHAPPY SOVEREIGN
FAIRFAX WHO HAD RESOLVED TO DECLARE FOR THE KING NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE GENERAL OPEN HIS INTENTIONS RETIRED TO HIS OWN HOUSE IN YORKSHIRE
EVERY ATTEMPT WHICH THE INSOLENCE OF THE GOVERNING PARTY HAD MADE TO SUBDUE HIS SPIRIT HAD HITHERTO PROVED FRUITLESS
DEVOTED TO RELIGION THOUGH HE PERPETUALLY EMPLOYED IT AS THE INSTRUMENT OF HIS AMBITION
CHAPTER LXII THE COMMONWEALTH
AN UNDISGUISED VIOLENCE COULD BE FORGIVEN
AS TO THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF CHARLES'S CHARACTER CHIEFLY EXCLAIMED AGAINST NAMELY HIS ARBITRARY PRINCIPLES IN GOVERNMENT ONE MAY VENTURE TO ASSERT THAT THE GREATEST ENEMIES OF THIS PRINCE WILL NOT FIND IN THE LONG LINE OF HIS PREDECESSORS FROM THE CONQUEST TO HIS TIME ANY ONE KING EXCEPT PERHAPS HIS FATHER WHOSE ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT MORE ARBITRARY AND LESS LEGAL OR WHOSE CONDUCT COULD HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO HIM BY THE POPULAR PARTY THEMSELVES AS A MODEL IN THIS PARTICULAR FOR HIS GOVERNMENT
REGIMENTS QUARTERED IN WHITEHALL AND THE MEWS
AND TO THIS USURPATION THE KING WAS OBLIGED PASSIVELY TO SUBMIT
IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO CALL A PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO FURNISH SUPPLIES BOTH FOR THE ORDINARY ADMINISTRATION AND FOR FULFILLING THOSE ENGAGEMENTS WITH FOREIGN PRINCES PARTICULARLY SWEDEN INTO WHICH THE LATE PROTECTOR HAD ENTERED
1625
1625
1625
THEY APPREHENDED THE MOST PRECIPITATE RESOLUTIONS FROM MEN OF SUCH VIOLENT AND HAUGHTY DISPOSITIONS
IN ORDER TO JOIN CONTUMELY TO CRUELTY THEY GAVE THE SUFFERERS THE EPITHET OF SCANDALOUS AND ENDEAVORED TO RENDER THEM AS ODIOUS AS THEY WERE MISERABLE THE GREATEST VICES HOWEVER WHICH THEY COULD REPROACH TO A GREAT PART OF THEM WERE BOWING AT THE NAME OF JESUS PLACING THE COMMUNION TABLE IN THE EAST READING THE KING'S ORDERS FOR SPORTS ON SUNDAY AND OTHER PRACTICES WHICH THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT BOTH IN CHURCH AND STATE HAD STRICTLY ENJOINED THEM
WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WAS INSTANTLY INVESTED WITH THE SUPREME COMMAND BOTH OF GENERAL AND ARMY
SO PREVALENT WAS THE TERROR OF THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
RUSH PART III
RUSH PART III
BUT HAVING GIVEN HIS WORD TO THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO ATTEMPT THE RECOVERY OF HIS LIBERTY DURING THE TREATY AND THREE WEEKS AFTER HE WOULD NOT BY ANY PERSUASION BE INDUCED TO HAZARD THE REPROACH OF VIOLATING THAT PROMISE
AND HE MADE SMALL PROFICIENCY IN HIS STUDIES
BRITISH EMPIRE IN AMERICA VOL
TO DENY THE PARLIAMENT ALL RIGHT OF REMONSTRATING AGAINST WHAT THEY ESTEEM GRIEVANCES WERE TO REDUCE THAT ASSEMBLY TO A TOTAL INSIGNIFICANCY AND TO DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF EVERY ADVANTAGE WHICH THEY COULD REAP FROM POPULAR COUNCILS
BUT WALLER HUNG ON THEIR REAR AND INFESTED THEIR MARCH TILL THEY REACHED THE DEVIZES
THE JURISDICTION OF THE COUNCIL ANNIHILATED
SIR JOHN ELLIOT HOLLIS AND VALENTINE WERE SUMMONED TO THEIR TRIAL IN THE KING'S BENCH FOR SEDITIOUS SPEECHES AND BEHAVIOR IN PARLIAMENT
IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE
BUT IN ORDER TO JUDGE MORE SURELY OF MEN'S DISPOSITIONS THE COUNCIL DELAYED THE MATTER TILL THE TWENTY-THIRD OF JULY
AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
BUT HIS APOLOGIES ARE OFTEN WELL GROUNDED
THE KING ORDERED ORMOND WHO WAS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIM TO SEND OVER CONSIDERABLE BODIES OF IT TO ENGLAND
IN THIS SITUATION SURELY THE NATION GOVERNED BY SO VIRTUOUS A MONARCH MAY FOR THE PRESENT REMAIN IN TRANQUILLITY AND TRY WHETHER IT BE NOT POSSIBLE BY PEACEFUL ARTS TO ELUDE THAT DANGER WITH WHICH IT IS PRETENDED ITS LIBERTIES ARE STILL THREATENED
HE HAD PARCELLED OUT THE PEOPLE INTO SO MANY SUBDIVISIONS OF SLAVERY AND HAD DELEGATED TO HIS INFERIOR MINISTERS THE SAME UNLIMITED AUTHORITY WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD SO VIOLENTLY ASSUMED
THE COUNCIL WAS INSULTED
YET WHAT NEW ILLEGAL BURDENS OUR ESTATES AND PERSONS HAVE GROANED UNDER MY HEART YEARNS TO THINK OF MY TONGUE FALTERS TO UTTER THE GRIEVANCES BY WHICH WE ARE OPPRESSED I DRAW UNDER TWO HEADS
MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
426
426
AND THOUGH HARRISON ASSURED HIM THAT HIS APPREHENSIONS WERE ENTIRELY GROUNDLESS IT WAS BY THAT CATASTROPHE SO FREQUENT WITH DETHRONED PRINCES THAT HE EXPECTED TO TERMINATE HIS LIFE
AND THE ROCHELLERS FINDING THEIR LAST HOPES TO FAIL THEM WERE REDUCED TO SURRENDER AT DISCRETION EVEN IN SIGHT OF THE ENGLISH ADMIRAL
AFTER MAKING A FRUITLESS ATTEMPT IN WHICH THE PEERS REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE TO GIVE PUBLIC WARNING THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE ENTERPRISES OF PAPISTS AND OTHER ILL-AFFECTED PERSONS THEY NOW RESOLVED BY A BOLD AND DECISIVE STROKE TO SEIZE AT ONCE THE WHOLE POWER OF THE SWORD AND TO CONFER IT ENTIRELY ON THEIR OWN CREATURES AND ADHERENTS
HE IS EXTREMELY IMPROVED OF LATE NO REPLIED SIR PHILIP HE WAS ALWAYS SO
IT WAS FORESEEN THAT A GREAT TEMPEST WAS READY TO BURST ON THE DUKE
THE INSOLENCE INDEED OF THE COMMONS AND THEIR HAUGHTY TREATMENT OF THE LORDS HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER
DON ALONZO SAID THAT THE INDIAN TRADE AND THE INQUISITION WERE HIS MASTER'S TWO EYES AND THE PROTECTOR INSISTED UPON THE PUTTING OUT BOTH OF THEM AT ONCE
NOBODY CAN TELL US WHAT THE WORDS OF THE PRETENDED COMMISSION WERE
WHERE MANY OPPORTUNITIES HE HOPED WOULD OFFER BY REASON OF HIS DISTANCE TO ELUDE THE ATTACKS OF HIS ENEMIES
THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND FROM THE INVASION OF JULIUS CAESAR TO THE END OF THE REIGN OF JAMES THE SECOND
A LIVELY PROOF HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS EVEN FOR THE MOST CORRUPTED MINDS TO DIVEST THEMSELVES OF ALL REGARD TO MORALITY AND SOCIAL DUTY
A FORMIDABLE FLEET OF SIXTY SAIL THE GREATEST THAT ENGLAND HAD EVER KNOWN WAS EQUIPPED UNDER THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND WHO HAD ORDERS TO ATTACK THE HERRING BUSSES OF THE DUTCH WHICH FISHED IN WHAT WERE CALLED THE BRITISH SEAS
SOME QUAKERS AT HASINGTON IN NORTHUMBERLAND COMING TO THE MINISTER ON THE SABBATH DAY AND SPEAKING TO HIM THE PEOPLE FELL UPON THE QUAKERS AND ALMOST KILLED ONE OR TWO OF THEM WHO GOING OUT FELL ON THEIR KNEES AND PRAYED GOD TO PARDON THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW NOT WHAT THEY DID
AND ON THEIR RETURN THEY WENT ROUND THE CHURCH REPEATING AS THEY MARCHED ALONG SOME OF THE PSALMS
TO RENOUNCE EPISCOPACY AND THE LITURGY AND TO SUBSCRIBE THE COVENANT WERE THE ONLY TERMS WHICH COULD SAVE THEM FROM SO RIGOROUS A FATE
IN ORDER TO CUT OFF ALL FURTHER SUPPLY FROM JONES HE HAD BEGUN THE REPARATION OF AN OLD FORT WHICH LAY AT THE GATES OF DUBLIN
125
AND VIOLENCE HAD INTERRUPTED BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO DESTROY THEIR RIGHT TO GOVERNMENT
THE KING HIMSELF SAID THAT IT MUST SURELY HAVE BEEN HIS OWN FAULT THAT HE HAD NOT SOONER TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE THRONE
CL
AND THAT YOUR MAJESTY WOULD BE PLEASED TO REMOVE THE SAID SOLDIERS AND MARINERS AND THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE SO BURDENED IN TIME TO COME
AND UNDER COLOR OF DEFENDING LIBERTY REVERSES A STATUTE THE BEST CALCULATED FOR THE SECURITY OF LIBERTY THAT HAD EVER BEEN ENACTED BY AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
NEVER SUBJECT IN FACT PROBABLY IN HIS INTENTIONS HAD DESERVED BETTER OF HIS KING AND COUNTRY
THAT DECISION WHICH ABOLISHED ALL LEGISLATIVE POWER EXCEPT THAT OF PARLIAMENT WAS REQUISITE FOR COMPLETING THE NEW PLAN OF LIBERTY AND RENDERING IT QUITE UNIFORM AND SYSTEMATICAL
THE OFFER HOWEVER OF AN ASSEMBLY AND A PARLIAMENT IN WHICH THEY EXPECTED TO BE ENTIRELY MASTERS WAS WILLINGLY EMBRACED BY THE COVENANTERS
270
270
AND SHALL WE AFTER ALL THESE OUR PRAYERS FASTINGS TEARS EXPECTATIONS AND SOLEMN APPEALS CALL THESE MERE EVENTS
43 62
BUT NO SOONER HAD THE DEAN OPENED THE BOOK THAN A MULTITUDE OF THE MEANEST SORT MOST OF THEM WOMEN CLAPPING THEIR HANDS CURSING AND CRYING OUT A POPE A POPE
THEN SHALL THE KING AS HE CALLS US HIS GREAT COUNCIL FIND US HIS TRUE COUNCIL AND OWN US HIS GOOD COUNCIL FRANKLYN P
THE KING HAVING IN HIS FIRST SPEECH CALLED THEM REBELS OBSERVED THAT HE HAD GIVEN GREAT OFFENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT
SINCE THE PRINCIPLES OF THESE FACTIONS WERE DESTRUCTIVE EITHER OF GOVERNMENT OR OF LIBERTY
THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAY MAKE YOU AS GREAT A PRINCE AS YOUR FATHER IF A LOW ONE
NEVER WAS THERE A PEOPLE LESS CORRUPTED BY VICE AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE THAN THE ENGLISH DURING THAT PERIOD
AND THEY CAST THEIR EYE TOWARDS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WITH WHOM THEY WERE ALREADY SO CLOSELY CONNECTED AND WHO COULD ALONE FULFIL ANY ARTICLES WHICH MIGHT BE AGREED ON
INSTEAD OF HOPING THAT ANY SUPPLY WOULD BE GRANTED HIM TO CARRY ON WAR AGAINST THE SCOTS WHOM THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE REGARDED AS THEIR BEST FRIENDS AND FIRMEST ALLIES
AS SOON AS THEY CAME TO MATURITY HE OPENLY JOINED THE TROOPS
THIS PETITION IS OF SO GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT WE SHALL HERE GIVE IT AT LENGTH
THE ORDERS WERE ENTIRELY VERBAL AND NOBODY AVOWED THEM
BUT THEIR SUCCESS WITH THE PUBLIC HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER ANSWERABLE TO THAT WHICH THEY MET WITH IN THE CHURCH AND THE COURT
THOUGH THE GENERAL TENOR OF HIS ADMINISTRATION STILL WANTS SOMEWHAT OF BEING ENTIRELY LEGAL AND PERHAPS MORE OF BEING ENTIRELY PRUDENT
THIS EXPEDIENT SAVED THAT VALUABLE COLLECTION
AND WHETHER HE WERE NOT SOLE JUDGE OF THE NECESSITY THESE GUARDIANS OF LAW AND LIBERTY REPLIED WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE THAT IN A CASE OF NECESSITY HE MIGHT IMPOSE THAT TAXATION AND THAT HE WAS SOLE JUDGE OF THE NECESSITY HAMBDEN HAD BEEN RATED AT TWENTY SHILLINGS FOR AN ESTATE WHICH HE POSSESSED IN THE COUNTY OF BUCKINGHAM
THE PLAIN CONSEQUENCE HE SAW OF ALL THESE RIGORS AND REFINEMENTS AND INFERENCES WAS THAT HE WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC NECESSITY AND WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF HIS OWN MUST OF A SUDDEN EVEN FROM HIS ACCESSION BECOME A MAGISTRATE OF A VERY DIFFERENT NATURE FROM ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS AND MUST FALL INTO A TOTAL DEPENDENCE ON SUBJECTS OVER WHOM FORMER KINGS ESPECIALLY THOSE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING HAD EXERCISED AN AUTHORITY ALMOST UNLIMITED
420 HE SAYS THAT UNLESS RELIGION WAS PRESERVED THE MILITIA BEING NOT AS IN FRANCE A FORMED POWERFUL STRENGTH WOULD BE OF LITTLE USE TO THE CROWN
HAMILTON AND HIS BROTHER THE EARL OF LANERIC WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THESE MEASURES WANTED EITHER AUTHORITY OR SINCERITY
THE MEANS HOWEVER WHICH BOTH JAMES AND CHARLES HAD EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE PARLIAMENT WERE ENTIRELY REGULAR AND NO REASONABLE PRETENCE HAD BEEN AFFORDED FOR REPRESENTING THESE LAWS AS NULL OR INVALID
ALL THE ACTIVITY WHICH HE DISCOVERED AND WHICH NEVER WAS GREAT WAS HOWEVER EXERTED TO BENEFICENT PURPOSES
THEY HAD SUPPOSED IT PRACTICABLE TO WREST THE PALATINATE BY ARMS FROM THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
AND INSTEAD OF ONE STAR CHAMBER WHICH HAD BEEN ABOLISHED A GREAT NUMBER WERE ANEW ERECTED FORTIFIED WITH BETTER PRETENCES AND ARMED WITH MORE UNLIMITED AUTHORITY CLEMENT WALKER'S HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY P
IN ALL THE DEBATES WHICH REMAIN NOT THE LEAST HINT IS EVER GIVEN THAT ANY FALSEHOOD WAS SUSPECTED IN THE NARRATIVE
A REMONSTRANCE FROM THE ARMY WAS MADE TO THE IRISH COUNCIL REPRESENTING THEIR INTOLERABLE NECESSITIES AND CRAVING PERMISSION TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM
AND THEY WERE FURTHER DETERRED FROM JOINING THE SCOTTISH ARMY BY THE ORDERS WHICH THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS HAD ISSUED NOT TO ADMIT ANY EVEN IN THIS DESPERATE EXTREMITY WHO WOULD NOT SUBSCRIBE THE COVENANT
AND THE COMMONS WITHOUT GIVING THE KING ANY SATISFACTION IN THE SETTLEMENT OF HIS REVENUE PROCEEDED TO CARRY THEIR INROADS WITH GREAT VIGOR INTO HIS NOW DEFENCELESS PREROGATIVE THE PROJECT OF BRINGING UP THE ARMY TO LONDON ACCORDING TO PIERCY WAS PROPOSED TO THE KING
AT WINDSOR HAMILTON WHO WAS THERE DETAINED A PRISONER WAS ADMITTED INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE
THE MESSENGER KNEW NOTHING OF THE LETTER IN THE SADDLE THOUGH SOME IN DOVER DID
THAT THEY LIVED IN THE MOST SUPINE SECURITY INTERSPERSED WITH THEIR NUMEROUS ENEMIES TRUSTING TO THE PROTECTION OF A SMALL ARMY WHICH WAS ITSELF SCATTERED IN INCONSIDERABLE DIVISIONS THROUGH OUT THE WHOLE KINGDOM
THE LORDS AS WELL AS COMMONS PASSED A VOTE DECLARING IT TO BE A HIGH BREACH OF PRIVILEGE FOR THE KING TO TAKE NOTICE OF ANY BILL WHICH WAS IN AGITATION IN EITHER OF THE HOUSES OR TO EXPRESS HIS SENTIMENTS WITH REGARD TO IT BEFORE IT BE PRESENTED TO HIM FOR HIS ASSENT IN A PARLIAMENTARY MANNER
SOME ACCUSED HIM OF RECOMMENDING SLAVISH DOCTRINES OF PROMOTING PERSECUTION AND OF ENCOURAGING SUPERSTITION
497 505
BOTH OF THEM IT MUST BE CONFESSED ARE SUPPORTED BY SUCH STRIKING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CONDUCT AND FORTUNE AS BESTOW ON THEIR REPRESENTATION A GREAT AIR OF PROBABILITY
IT CONSISTS OF MANY GROSS FALSEHOODS INTERMINGLED WITH SOME EVIDENT TRUTHS
HAVING LEFT WINDHAM'S HOUSE HE WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO RETURN TO IT
SOME STATE WAS UPHELD
THESE JOINED TO A SMALL COMMITTEE OF LORDS WERE VESTED WITH AUTHORITY TO EXAMINE ALL WITNESSES TO CALL FOR EVERY PAPER AND TO USE ANY MEANS OF SCRUTINY WITH REGARD TO ANY PART OF THE EARL'S BEHAVIOR AND CONDUCT AFTER SO GENERAL AND UNBOUNDED AN INQUISITION EXERCISED BY SUCH POWERFUL AND IMPLACABLE ENEMIES A MAN MUST HAVE BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS OR VERY INNOCENT NOT TO AFFORD DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE SOME MATTER OF ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM
AND THENCE INSISTED ON BETTER TREATMENT FROM THE CITIZEN

THE TITULAR ARCHBISHOP OF TUAM BEING KILLED BY A SALLY OF THE GARRISON OF SLIGO THE ARTICLES OF THE TREATY WERE FOUND AMONG HIS BAGGAGE AND WERE IMMEDIATELY PUBLISHED EVERY WHERE AND COPIES OF THEM SENT OVER TO THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND LORD DIGBY FORESEEING THE CLAMOR WHICH WOULD BE RAISED AGAINST THE KING COMMITTED GLAMORGAN TO PRISON CHARGED HIM WITH TREASON FOR HIS TEMERITY AND MAINTAINED THAT HE HAD ACTED ALTOGETHER WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY FROM HIS MASTER
AND HAVING TOLD THE FEMALE ZEALOTS THAT THEIR PETITION WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND WAS PRESENTED IN A SEASONABLE TIME HE BEGGED THAT THEIR PRAYERS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE COMMONS MIGHT FOLLOW THEIR PETITION
THEY THOUGHT IT THEREFORE THEIR DUTY TO PROCEED TO A THOROUGH REFORMATION AND TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE REIGN OF THE REDEEMER AND FOR THAT GREAT WORK WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED THE LORD WAS TO BRING FORTH AMONG THEM
AND BEING PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF LORD BIRON THEY BESIEGED AND TOOK THE CASTLES OF HAWARDEN BEESTON ACTON AND DEDDINGTON HOUSE NO PLACE IN CHESHIRE OR THE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW ADHERED TO THE PARLIAMENT EXCEPT NANTWICH
THE ENGLISH COMMANDERS IN ORDER TO ATONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THIS UNPROSPEROUS ATTEMPT BENT THEIR COURSE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS SURRENDERED TO THEM WITHOUT A BLOW
IT BEHOVED THEN THE PARLIAMENT TO SUBMIT
AND HE PREPARED HIMSELF TO SUFFER THE FATAL SENTENCE
BUT THIS PARLIAMENT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR ACCORDING TO SOME COMPUTATIONS HAD LEVIED IN FIVE YEARS ABOVE FORTY MILLIONS YET WERE LOADED WITH DEBTS AND INCUMBRANCES WHICH DURING THAT AGE WERE REGARDED AS PRODIGIOUS
AND THE SUPPOSED ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE THE ARMY AGAINST THEM SERVED WITH MANY AS A CONFIRMATION OF THIS JEALOUSY
16 17
THE KING REFUSED TO ASSIST AT THE SERVICE EXERCISED ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTORY
OF WHICH I NEITHER DO NOR I HOPE WILL REPENT
EVEN A VISIT OF THE PRINCE TO HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN OPENLY COMPLAINED OF AND REMONSTRANCES AGAINST IT HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER APPREHENSIVE OF ATTACKS STILL MORE VIOLENT SHE WAS DESIROUS OF FACILITATING HER ESCAPE
HEARING THAT LAMBERT WAS ADVANCING NORTHWARD WITH HIS ARMY MONK SENT CLOBERRY AND TWO OTHER COMMISSIONERS TO LONDON WITH LARGE PROFESSIONS OF HIS INCLINATION TO PEACE AND WITH OFFERS OF TERMS FOR AN ACCOMMODATION
AFTER MONK'S DECLARATION FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT ON THE ELEVENTH OF FEBRUARY HE COULD MEAN NOTHING BUT THE KING'S RESTORATION
A PETITION AGAINST THE ALTERATION OF THE MILITIA WAS CARRIED TO WESTMINSTER ATTENDED BY THE APPRENTICES AND SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE WHO BESIEGED THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
AND THEY INTENDED TO PRESENT A PETITION WHICH WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN EQUIVALENT TO A COMMAND FOR REMOVING HIM FROM HIS MAJESTY'S PERSON AND COUNCILS THE KING WAS ALARMED AT THE YOKE WHICH HE SAW PREPARED FOR HIM
THE ALTERCATION OF DISCOURSE THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE PEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DECLAMATIONS OF THE PULPIT INDISPOSED THE MINDS OF MEN TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND PROPAGATED THE BLIND RAGE OF PARTY FIERCE HOWEVER AND INFLAMED AS WERE THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE ENGLISH BY A WAR BOTH CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS THAT GREAT DESTROYER OF HUMANITY ALL THE EVENTS OF THIS PERIOD ARE LESS DISTINGUISHED BY ATROCIOUS DEEDS EITHER OF TREACHERY OR CRUELTY THAN WERE EVER ANY INTESTINE DISCORDS WHICH HAD SO LONG A CONTINUANCE
IN ORDER TO BRING ON AN ACTION HE DIRECTED HIS MARCH TOWARDS THE CAPITAL WHICH HE KNEW THE ENEMY WOULD NOT ABANDON TO HIM
THEY DREW UP A REMONSTRANCE TO PENNINGTON THEIR COMMANDER AND SIGNING ALL THEIR NAMES IN A CIRCLE LEST HE SHOULD DISCOVER THE RINGLEADERS THEY LAID IT UNDER HIS PRAYER-BOOK
SIR JOHN HEYDON THE ARTILLERY
BUT THE HIGH IDEA OF HIS OWN AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD IMBIBED MADE HIM INCAPABLE OF GIVING WAY TO THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY WHICH BEGAN TO PREVAIL AMONG HIS SUBJECTS
BUT CHARLES NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PUBLIC DECLARATION WAS FAR FROM ASSENTING TO THIS CONCLUSION IN ITS FULL EXTENT
ORMOND HAVING RECEIVED LIKE ORDERS DELIVERED DUBLIN AND OTHER FORTS INTO THE HANDS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY OFFICERS
INIGO JONES WAS MASTER OF THE KING'S BUILDINGS
BUT THEY CARRIED THEIR PRETENSIONS MUCH HIGHER
LONDON STILL RETAINED A STRONG ATTACHMENT TO PRESBYTERIANISM
AND EVERY ONE WAS SENSIBLE OF THE TRUE MOTIVE OF HIS CHANGE
1630 PEACE WAS AFTERWARDS CONCLUDED WITH SPAIN WHERE NO CONDITIONS WERE MADE IN FAVOR OF THE PALATINE EXCEPT THAT SPAIN PROMISED IN GENERAL TO USE THEIR GOOD OFFICES FOR HIS RESTORATION THE INFLUENCE OF THESE TWO WARS ON DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND ON THE DISPOSITIONS OF KING AND PEOPLE WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE
EVEN THE ENGLISH CHURCH THOUGH IT HAD RETAINED A SHARE OF POPISH CEREMONIES MAY JUSTLY BE THOUGHT TOO NAKED AND UNADORNED AND STILL TO APPROACH TOO NEAR THE ABSTRACT AND SPIRITUAL RELIGION OF THE PURITANS
SEE NOTE D AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND WHEN DISAPPOINTED HE THREW UP HIS COMMISSION AND RETIRED IN DISCONTENT FROM THE ARMY
BY CONVERSATION BY LETTERS BY HIS EMISSARIES HE REPRESENTED TO HIS COUNTRYMEN THE MOTIVES OF A REVOLT
SIR PHELIM O'NEALE AMONG THE REST WAS SOME TIME AFTER BROUGHT TO THE GIBBET AND SUFFERED AN IGNOMINIOUS DEATH WHICH HE HAD SO WELL MERITED BY HIS INHUMAN CRUELTIES
AND THE DISCONTENTS IN ENGLAND THOUGH SECRET WERE BELIEVED SO VIOLENT THAT THE KING IT WAS THOUGHT WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO EMPLOY IN SUCH A CAUSE THE POWER OF THAT KINGDOM
HE WOULD NOT TRUST HIS OWN BROTHER THE MOMENT HE KNEW THAT HE HAD DISCLOSED THE SECRET THOUGH TO A MAN WHOM HE HIMSELF COULD HAVE TRUSTED LORD LANSDOWNE'S DEFENCE OF GENERAL MONK

1632 THE COUNCIL OF YORK HAD BEEN FIRST ERECTED AFTER A REBELLION BY A PATENT FROM HENRY VIII WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT
MATHER'S HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND BOOK I
DURING A PEACE OF NEAR FORTY YEARS THE INVETERATE QUARRELS BETWEEN THE NATIONS SEEMED IN A GREAT MEASURE TO BE OBLITERATED
NOT ONLY THE EARS OF THE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM
IN 1633 THE KING HAD OBTAINED A GENERAL RATIFICATION OF EVERY ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT
AMIDST THE PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES OF THAT PERIOD THAT HE SHOULD PREFER THE PARLIAMENTARY TO THE ROYAL CAUSE WILL NOT APPEAR EXTRAORDINARY

IT WAS REMARKED BY THE SAINTS OF THAT TIME THAT THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON A DAY WHICH WAS HELD FOR A FAST IN LONDON
THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
AND THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM GUARDS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM AN ATTACK TOO WAS MADE DURING THE NIGHT UPON LAUD IN HIS PALACE OF LAMBETH BY ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS
AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THE IRISH REBELS PLEADED THE KING'S COMMISSION FOR ALL THEIR ACTS OF VIOLENCE BIGOTRY EVER CREDULOUS AND MALIGNANT ASSENTED WITHOUT SCRUPLE TO THAT GROSS IMPOSTURE AND LOADED THE UNHAPPY PRINCE WITH THE WHOLE ENORMITY OF A CONTRIVANCE SO BARBAROUS AND INHUMAN 8 SEE NOTE H
SOME OF THEM HE PLACED AT THE DOOR SOME IN THE LOBBY SOME ON THE STAIRS
BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE CIVIL DISORDERS THE EARL OF MONTROSE A YOUNG NOBLEMAN OF A DISTINGUISHED FAMILY RETURNING FROM HIS TRAVELS HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE KING AND HAD MADE AN OFFER OF HIS SERVICES
THE PROTECTOR WANTED THE RESOLUTION TO DENY AND POSSESSED LITTLE ABILITY TO RESIST
BUT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME EXAGGERATION IN THIS MATTER
THEY EVEN COMPREHENDED VERBAL OFFENCES NAY INTENTIONS THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER APPEARED IN ANY OVERT ACT AGAINST THE STATE
HE ALSO ENDEAVORED TO GET POSSESSION OF BREMEN
IT IS FIRST TOLD BY ROGER COKE A VERY PASSIONATE AND FOOLISH HISTORIAN WHO WROTE TOO SO LATE AS KING WILLIAM'S REIGN
THE REPUBLICAN FACTION MEANWHILE IN ENGLAND EMPLOYED IN SUBDUING THE REVOLTED ROYALISTS IN REDUCING THE PARLIAMENT TO SUBJECTION IN THE TRIAL CONDEMNATION AND EXECUTION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN TOTALLY NEGLECTED THE SUPPLYING OF IRELAND AND ALLOWED JONES AND THE FORCES IN DUBLIN TO REMAIN IN THE UTMOST WEAKNESS AND NECESSITY
AND THE HURRY AND DANGERS OF ACTION INSTEAD OF BANISHING THEIR PIOUS VISIONS RATHER SERVED TO IMPRESS THEIR MINDS MORE STRONGLY WITH THEM
LORD NEWPORT LITTLETON AND OTHER GENTLEMEN CONSPIRED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF SHREWSBURY
THEY PURPOSED TO EMBARK A STRONG DETACHMENT UNDER SKIPPON AND MASSEY FOR THE SERVICE OF IRELAND
IN ORDER TO ELUDE THIS LAW THE KING OFFERED TO RAISE TEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS FOR THE IRISH SERVICE
AND ACCORDINGLY TAKING THE PRINCE OF WALES AND THE DUKE OF YORK ALONG WITH HIM HE ARRIVED BY SLOW JOURNEYS AT YORK WHICH HE DETERMINED FOR SOME TIME TO MAKE THE PLACE OF HIS RESIDENCE
THE INHABITANTS THOUGH PRESSED WITH THE GREATEST RIGORS OF FAMINE STILL REFUSED TO SUBMIT
EVEN THOSE VIOLENT EXPEDIENTS THEMSELVES WHICH OCCASIONED THE COMPLAINT THAT THE CONSTITUTION WAS SUBVERTED HAD BEEN ALL OF THEM CONDUCTED SO FAR AS APPEARED WITHOUT HIS COUNSEL OR ASSISTANCE
COMBINATIONS AND CONSPIRACIES THEY WERE SENSIBLE WERE EVERY WHERE FORMING AROUND THEM
130 131 THE SLAIN ON THE SIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT EXCEEDED THOSE ON THE SIDE OF THE KING
AND THOUGH HE TOOK NO STEP TOWARDS THE EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT THE VERY PRETENSION TO SUCH POWER HAD EXCITED JEALOUSY AND DISCONTENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE TENDER REGARD WHICH CHARLES BORE TO THE WHOLE CHURCH HE HAD BEEN ABLE IN SCOTLAND TO ACQUIRE ONLY THE AFFECTION OF THE SUPERIOR RANK AMONG THE CLERGY
ALL PLACES WERE FULL OF DANGER AND INQUIETUDE
THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC BORE HIM A CORDIAL AFFECTION
THE FORCES DESTINED FOR IRELAND WERE QUARTERED IN THE WEST
THE ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW PARLIAMENT WENT EVERY WHERE IN FAVOR OF THE KING'S PARTY
AND AS THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF THAT KINGDOM REGARDED THEIR ATTENDANCE ON ENGLISH PARLIAMENTS AS AN IGNOMINIOUS BADGE OF SLAVERY IT WAS ON THAT ACCOUNT MORE EASY FOR THE OFFICERS TO PREVAIL IN THE ELECTIONS
HIS PREPARATIONS WERE NOT NEAR SO FORWARD AS THOSE OF THE PARLIAMENT
TO-MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE

SOME OF THE LORDS HAVING DESIRED THAT A MESSAGE MIGHT BE SENT TO THE PARLIAMENT WITH OVERTURES TO A TREATY CHARLES WHO WELL KNEW THAT AN ACCOMMODATION IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION MEANT NOTHING BUT A TOTAL SUBMISSION HASTILY BROKE UP THE COUNCIL LEST THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE FURTHER INSISTED ON

AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION
EVERY PASSIONATE SPEECH EVERY MENACING GESTURE OF ANY EVEN THE MEANEST OF HIS ATTENDANTS WAS RECORDED AND AGGRAVATED
THE ADVANCE OF THE ARMY TO LONDON THE SUBJECTION OF THE PARLIAMENT THE SEIZING OF THE KING AT HOLDENBY HIS CONFINEMENT IN CARISBROKE CASTLE WERE SO MANY BLOWS SENSIBLY FELT BY THAT NATION AS THREATENING THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF PRESBYTERY TO WHICH THEY WERE SO PASSIONATELY DEVOTED
THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
THE SOLDIERS INSTIGATED BY THEIR SUPERIORS WERE BROUGHT THOUGH WITH DIFFICULTY TO CRY ALOUD FOR JUSTICE
ALL UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTING HIM FROM DANGER BUT REALLY WITH A VIEW OF MAKING HIM UNEASY IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION
AND THEY AFFIRMED THAT THE PEOPLE IN MANY COUNTIES HAD APPLIED TO THEM FOR THAT PURPOSE AND IN SOME PLACES WERE OF THEMSELVES AND BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY PROVIDING AGAINST THOSE URGENT DANGERS WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED RUSH
MEN WHO WERE NOW FORMED INTO A REGULAR PARTY AND UNITED AS WELL BY FIXED AIMS AND PROJECTS AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM
THE PRUDENT SCOTCHMAN KNEW THAT THOUGH SUPERIOR IN NUMBERS HIS ARMY WAS MUCH INFERIOR IN DISCIPLINE TO THE ENGLISH
NO SOONER WERE THEY ASSEMBLED THAN THEY VOTED A REMONSTRANCE
TOLERATION HAD HITHERTO BEEN SO LITTLE THE PRINCIPLE OF ANY CHRISTIAN SECT THAT EVEN THE CATHOLICS THE REMNANT OF THE RELIGION PROFESSED BY THEIR FOREFATHERS COULD NOT OBTAIN FROM THE ENGLISH THE LEAST INDULGENCE
IF ANY DIFFERENCE COULD BE MADE IN THIS PARTICULAR IT WERE BETTER TO ABANDON EVEN LIFE OR PROPERTY TO THE ARBITRARY WILL OF THE PRINCE
THE OFFICERS TOO OF THE SAME PARTY WHOM CROMWELL HAD DISCARDED OVERTON LUDLOW RICH OKEY ALURED BEGAN TO APPEAR AND TO RECOVER THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HAD BEEN ONLY FOR A TIME SUSPENDED
THE SEVERE VOTES PASSED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PARLIAMENT AGAINST LIEUTENANTS AND THEIR DEPUTIES FOR EXERCISING POWERS ASSUMED BY ALL THEIR PREDECESSORS HAD TOTALLY DISARMED THE CROWN AND HAD NOT LEFT IN ANY MAGISTRATE MILITARY AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT FOR THE DEFENCE AND SECURITY OF THE NATION
THE FORMER PARTY FROM INCLINATION AND PRINCIPLE ZEALOUSLY ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THE SON OF THEIR UNFORTUNATE MONARCH WHOSE MEMORY THEY RESPECTED AND WHOSE TRAGICAL DEATH THEY DEPLORED
CROMWELL PRETENDED TO HEARKEN TO THEM AND WAS WELL PLEASED TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR AN ACCOMMODATION IF THE COURSE OF EVENTS SHOULD AT ANY TIME RENDER IT NECESSARY
WHAT A PARADOX IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THAT HENRY VIII
THIS VOTE BROUGHT AFFAIRS IMMEDIATELY TO A RUPTURE
AND THEY WOULD GIVE TO THESE SACRED EDIFICES NO OTHER APPELLATION THAN THAT OF SHOPS OR STEEPLEHOUSES
THOSE MILITARY HONORS TRANSMITTED TO THEM FROM THEIR ANCESTORS HAD RECEIVED A GRIEVOUS STAIN BY TWO UNSUCCESSFUL AND ILL-CONDUCTED EXPEDITIONS
BUT WITH LITTLE EXPENSE AND WITHOUT ANY SPLENDOR

NOR OUGHT ANY OBJECTIONS DERIVED FROM HIS PROFOUND SILENCE EVEN TO CHARLES HIMSELF TO BE REGARDED AS CONSIDERABLE
AND BEEN FORCED FROM THAT PATH IN WHICH THE RECTITUDE OF HIS PRINCIPLES WOULD HAVE INCLINED HIM TO HAVE CONSTANTLY TROD
NOT ONLY BATTLES WERE WON TOWNS AND FORTRESSES TAKEN
BISHOP BURNET'S TESTIMONY TOO MUST BE ALLOWED OF SOME WEIGHT AGAINST THE ICON
THE LOWER POPULACE TOO SO EASILY GUIDED OR DECEIVED WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE ELECTIONS
AND DAVENANT IN RETURN AFFORDED HIM LIKE PROTECTION AFTER THE RESTORATION
BUT THEY AGAIN INTRODUCED THE SAME BILL THOUGH NO PROROGATION HAD INTERVENED
AND EVERY MAN THERE AS IN A REGULAR ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT WAS CONFINED TO THE STATION IN WHICH HIS BIRTH HAD PLACED HIM
AND WHILE HE EXPRESSED HIS OWN PENITENCE HE RECEIVED THEIR DEVOUT EXHORTATIONS WITH HUMILITY AND REVERENCE AS CONVEYING CLEARER CONVICTION AND INFORMATION THAN IN HIS LIFE HE HAD EVER BEFORE ATTAINED
THE ENGLISH DISCOURAGED WITH THE BAD CONDUCT OF THEIR OFFICERS AND SCARCELY ALIVE FROM HUNGER THIRST AND FATIGUE WERE UNABLE TO RESIST
BLAKE A MAN OF GREAT COURAGE AND A GENEROUS DISPOSITION THE SAME PERSON WHO HAD DEFENDED LYME AND TAUNTEN WITH SUCH UNSHAKEN OBSTINACY AGAINST THE LATE KING WAS MADE AN ADMIRAL
258
THIS WAS THE TIME HE CHOSE FOR EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DYING PRIMATE AND TREPANNING HIM INTO A CONFESSION THAT HE TRUSTED FOR HIS SALVATION TO THE MERITS OF GOOD WORKS NOT TO THE DEATH OF THE REDEEMER HAVING EXTRICATED HIMSELF FROM THESE THEOLOGICAL TOILS THE ARCHBISHOP LAID HIS HEAD ON THE BLOCK AND IT WAS SEVERED FROM THE BODY AT ONE BLOW THOSE RELIGIOUS OPINIONS FOR WHICH HE SUFFERED CONTRIBUTED NO DOUBT TO THE COURAGE AND CONSTANCY OF HIS END
THE KING SAID HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED AND PROMISED TO GIVE THEM HIS ANSWER IN WRITING ACCORDING TO THEIR DESIRE
I MIGHT ADD THAT THE LORD LIEUTENANT'S CONCURRENCE IN THE TREATY WAS THE MORE REQUISITE BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THE TREATY COULD NOT BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION BY GLAMORGAN NOR THE IRISH TROOPS BE TRANSPORTED INTO ENGLAND
THE OTHER PARTY WERE DENOMINATED RESOLUTIONERS
SIR GEORGE BOOTH OF CHESTER

THE SCOTS BEING SUCH USEFUL ALLIES TO THE MALECONTENT PARTY IN ENGLAND NO WONDER THEY WERE COURTED WITH THE MOST UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT SERVICES
THAT TRANSACTION WAS ENTIRELY INNOCENT

THAT IN THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT HE OPENLY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF STILL RETAINING THE SAME MERCENARY ARMY BY WHOSE ASSISTANCE HE HAD SUBDUED THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT AND WHO WOULD WITH LESS SCRUPLE OBEY HIM IN OVERTURNING WHENEVER HE SHOULD PLEASE TO ORDER THEM THAT NEW SYSTEM WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN PLEASED TO MODEL

SOON AFTER HE SIGNED HIS DEMISSION IN FORM
AND WALLER WITHOUT PLACING ANY GARRISONS IN HIS NEW CONQUESTS RETIRED TO GLOUCESTER AND HE THENCE JOINED THE ARMY UNDER THE EARL OF ESSEX HE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF LICHFIELD AND WAS VIEWING FROM A WINDOW ST CHAD'S CATHEDRAL IN WHICH A PARTY OF THE ROYALISTS HAD FORTIFIED THEMSELVES

AND THAT HIS CONJUGAL TENDERNESS AND HIS LIFE SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL DURATION
A TAXATION THE MOST ILLEGAL AND THE MOST DANGEROUS THAT HAD EVER IN ANY REIGN BEEN IMPOSED UPON THE NATION
CROMWELL LOOKING THROUGH A GLASS SAW THE ENEMY'S CAMP IN MOTION
HE MARCHED TOWARDS WORCESTER

IT WAS NOW FULL TIME FOR THEM TO GIVE PLACE TO OTHERS
ESSAY OF ATHEISM
IN A WORD THE PARLIAMENT AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR VIOLENCES AND STILL MORE AFTER BEGINNING THE CIVIL WAR HAD REASON FOR THEIR SCRUPLES AND JEALOUSIES FOUNDED ON THE VERY NATURE OF THEIR SITUATION AND ON THE GENERAL PROPENSITY OF THE HUMAN MIND
SIR WILLIAM BALFOUR WHO COMMANDED ESSEX'S RESERVE PERCEIVED THE ADVANTAGE
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS THE PROTECTOR STILL FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY WOULD NOT BE FAVORABLE TO HIM
THE DOCTOR HAVING AN ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE CHAPLAIN TALKED VERY FREELY TO HIM ABOUT THE OBJECT OF HIS JOURNEY AND ENGAGED HIM IF THERE SHOULD BE OCCASION TO SECOND HIS APPLICATIONS
YET WAS THE SUCCESS UPON THE WHOLE SO CONSIDERABLE AS MIGHTILY RAISED THE COURAGE OF THE ONE PARTY AND DEPRESSED THAT OF THE OTHER
AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE INCAPACITY OF BUCKINGHAM ENCOURAGED THE FREE SPIRIT OF THE COMMONS TO ESTABLISH IN ENGLAND A REGULAR SYSTEM OF LIBERTY

YET WERE ALL THE SHERIFFS AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THAT ILLEGAL SERVICE VOTED BY A VERY RIGOROUS SENTENCE TO BE DELINQUENTS
THE GENEROUS NATURE OF MORE WAS SHOCKED AT THE RECITAL OF SUCH ENORMOUS CRUELTIES
THE CHANCELLOR LOUDON WHO HAD AT FIRST COUNTENANCED HAMILTON'S ENTERPRISE BEING TERRIFIED WITH THE MENACES OF THE CLERGY HAD SOME TIME BEFORE GONE OVER TO THE OTHER PARTY
THE REGIMENTS NEAR THAT CITY BEING SOLICITED BY THEIR OLD OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN CASHIERED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY REVOLTED AGAIN TO THE PARLIAMENT

IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE PURITANS WERE EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THE RAISING OF THIS ORNAMENT TO THE CAPITAL
I MUST DO IT AND SUDDENLY STARTING UP HE LOADED THE PARLIAMENT WITH THE VILEST REPROACHES FOR THEIR TYRANNY AMBITION OPPRESSION AND ROBBERY OF THE PUBLIC
HE WAS ORDERED TO BE EXAMINED
THE JUDGES WHO HAD GIVEN THEIR VOTE AGAINST HAMBDEN IN THE TRIAL OF SHIP MONEY WERE ACCUSED BEFORE THE PEERS AND OBLIGED TO FIND SURETY FOR THEIR APPEARANCE
THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED IT AS A MAXIM THAT EVEN A STATUTE WHICH SHOULD BE ENACTED IN CONTRADICTION TO ANY ARTICLE OF THAT CHARTER CANNOT HAVE FORCE OR VALIDITY BUT WITH REGARD TO THAT IMPORTANT ARTICLE WHICH SECURES PERSONAL LIBERTY SO FAR FROM ATTEMPTING AT ANY TIME ANY LEGAL INFRINGEMENT OF IT THEY HAVE CORROBORATED IT BY SIX STATUTES AND PUT IT OUT OF ALL DOUBT AND CONTROVERSY
SO FAR THEREFORE FROM BEING WILLING TO SECOND THE KING IN SUBDUING THE FREE SPIRIT OF THE SCOTS THEY RATHER PITIED THAT UNHAPPY PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN PUSHED TO THOSE EXTREMITIES

WITHIN TEN DAYS VAST QUANTITIES OF PLATE WERE BROUGHT TO THEIR TREASURERS

THE KING'S PASSION FOR THE FAIR COULD NOT ALTOGETHER BE RESTRAINED
A NEUTRALITY WAS EMBRACED BY THE KING
AND WHAT THEY MORE VALUED THAN ALL THESE ADVANTAGES THEY HAD A NEAR PROSPECT OF SPREADING THE PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN ENGLAND AND IRELAND FROM THE SEEDS WHICH THEY HAD SCATTERED OF THEIR RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES
BUT THOUGH THE KING'S INTERPOSITION BY AN OFFER OR ADVICE DOES IN SOME DEGREE OVERAWE OR RESTRAIN LIBERTY
WHEN THE IRISH ARMY WAS CALLED OVER INTO ENGLAND SURMISES OF THIS KIND HAD BEEN SO FAR CREDITED THAT HE HAD EVEN BEEN SUSPENDED FROM HIS COMMAND AND ORDERED TO OXFORD THAT HE MIGHT ANSWER THE CHARGE LAID AGAINST HIM
FIVE HUNDRED OF HIS MEN KILLED ON THE SPOT
HE HAD ATTAINED THE PINNACLE OF PERFECTION AND BORNE AWAY THE PALM OF EPIC POETRY
BUT IT WAS SO ILL PAID AND HER CREDIT RAN SO LOW THAT ONE MORNING WHEN THE CARDINAL DE RETZ WAITED ON HER SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HER DAUGHTER THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA WAS OBLIGED TO LIE ABED FOR WANT OF A FIRE TO WARM HER

THOSE LOFTY IDEAS OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAS DERIVED FROM HIS EARLY EDUCATION WHICH ARE UNITED IN HIS MIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE ILLUSIONS OF SELF-LOVE WHICH ARE CORROBORATED BY HIS MISTAKEN PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION IT IS IN VAIN TO HOPE THAT IN HIS MORE ADVANCED AGE HE WILL SINCERELY RENOUNCE FROM ANY SUBSEQUENT REFLECTION OR EXPERIENCE
BUT STILL KEPT THEM WITH A SECRET INTENTION OF EMPLOYING THEM AGAINST HIMSELF
TILL FAIRFAX WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND BROUGHT UP THE RESERVE AND RENEWED THE COMBAT
THE MEMORY TOO OF THESE TWO KINGS FROM LIKE CAUSES HAS BEEN ATTENDED IN SOME DEGREE WITH THE SAME INFELICITY WHICH PURSUED THEM DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES
OR WITHOUT SOME CHIEF MAGISTRATE INVESTED WITH ROYAL AUTHORITY TO PRESERVE PEACE OR JUSTICE IN THE COMMUNITY
MILITARY NATIONS WERE NOT NOW ENGAGED AGAINST AN UNDISCIPLINED AND UNWARLIKE PEOPLE
SOUTHAMPTON WAS NOT ALLOWED BY THE PEERS TO TAKE HIS SEAT
P 388
THE FIRST POINT INSISTED ON BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS WAS THE KING'S RECALLING ALL HIS PROCLAMATIONS AND DECLARATIONS AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT AND THE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY HAD TAKEN ARMS IN THEIR OWN DEFENCE
INDIVIDUALS THEY MAINTAINED IN RESIGNING TO THE PUBLIC THEIR NATURAL LIBERTY COULD BESTOW ON IT ONLY WHAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE POSSESSED OF A RIGHT OF PERFORMING LAWFUL ACTIONS AND COULD INVEST IT WITH NO AUTHORITY OF COMMANDING WHAT IS CONTRARY TO THE DECREES OF HEAVEN
SHORTLY AFTER HE BEGGED WITH MUCH EARNESTNESS THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW CROMWELL TO SERVE THAT CAMPAIGN AND THUS THE INDEPENDENTS THOUGH THE MINORITY PREVAILED BY ART AND CUNNING OVER THE PRESBYTERIANS AND BESTOWED THE WHOLE MILITARY AUTHORITY IN APPEARANCE UPON FAIRFAX
AND CROMWELL WAS OF THE NUMBER
AND THE CHURCH WAS BECOME A CONSIDERABLE BARRIER TO THE POWER BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL OF THE CROWN
THE KING MUST SUBMIT WITHOUT RESERVE TO THE TERMS IMPOSED UPON HIM
AND THE ARMY HAD LEISURE TO EXECUTE THEIR VIOLENT AND SANGUINARY PURPOSES
P 511
IF THESE COMPUTATIONS SHOULD BE THOUGHT MUCH EXAGGERATED AS THEY PROBABLY ARE THE TAXES AND IMPOSITIONS WERE CERTAINLY FAR HIGHER THAN IN ANY FORMER STATE OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT
HE MADE INCREDIBLE HASTE
I AM THE ONLY MAN HE WAS OFTEN HEARD TO SAY WHO HAS KNOWN HOW TO SUBDUE THAT INSOLENT SECT WHICH CAN SUFFER NONE BUT ITSELF THE PROTESTANT ZEAL WHICH POSSESSED THE PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS WAS HIGHLY GRATIFIED BY THE HAUGHTY MANNER IN WHICH THE PROTECTOR SO SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORTED THE PERSECUTED PROTESTANTS THROUGHOUT ALL EUROPE
ALL ORDERS OF MEN ARE THEN LEVELLED
AND THAT THEY MIGHT PREVENT THE REIGN OF THE SAINTS FROM COMING TO AN UNTIMELY END THEY PLACED ONE MOYER IN THE CHAIR AND BEGAN TO DRAW UP PROTESTS
NOR DID MODERATE MEN ESTEEM THE PROVOCATION WHICH THE KING HAD RECEIVED THOUGH GREAT SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT ALL THESE VIOLENT MEASURES
AND HE WAS FAITHFUL TO HIS ENGAGEMENT
THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
HE PROSTRATED HIMSELF WITH ALL HUMILITY BEFORE THEM
IN SHORT EVERY THING WHICH EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT REASON HAD GIVEN OFFENCE DURING THE COURSE OF FIFTEEN YEARS FROM THE ACCESSION OF THE KING TO THE CALLING OF THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT
AMIDST ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES AND DISTURBANCES THE STEADY MIND OF CROMWELL WITHOUT CONFUSION OR EMBARRASSMENT STILL PURSUED ITS PURPOSE
AND PRETENDING WANT OF PROVISIONS HAD SAILED FROM THE SOUND TOWARDS THE COAST OF ENGLAND WITH AN INTENTION OF SUPPORTING THAT INSURRECTION OF THE ROYALISTS
738 750 751 ETC
OF GRIEF AS IS SUPPOSED FOR HER FATHER'S TRAGICAL END
EXPEDIENCY AT OTHER TIMES WOULD COVER ITSELF UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EXCITED INDIGNATION AND ENGAGED THE MINISTERS IN THOSE SEVERE MEASURES
NEVERTHELESS AGAINST THE TENOR OF THE SAID STATUTES AND OTHER THE GOOD LAWS AND STATUTES OF YOUR REALM TO THAT END PROVIDED DIVERS OF YOUR SUBJECTS HAVE OF LATE BEEN IMPRISONED WITHOUT ANY CAUSE SHOWED
THEIR ADVERSARIES WERE THE GODLY AND THE WELL-AFFECTED
IN THE HANDS OF THOSE MEMBERS THEY SAID ARE LODGED ALL THE CONSIDERABLE COMMANDS OF THE ARMY ALL THE LUCRATIVE OFFICES IN THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION
IN VAIN DID FLIGHT SAVE FROM THE FIRST ASSAULT
FOR I AM DAILY MORE AND MORE SATISFIED WITH THE GOVERNOR AND FIND THESE ISLANDERS VERY GOOD PEACEABLE AND QUIET PEOPLE
HIS ARTILLERY THOUGH FAR FROM NUMEROUS HAD BEEN LEFT AT YORK FOR WANT OF HORSES TO TRANSPORT IT
AND EVERY ODIOUS EPITHET OF TRAITOR AND ASSASSIN WOULD BY THE GENERAL VOICE OF MANKIND BE INDISPUTABLY ASCRIBED TO THE ACTORS IN SUCH A VILLANY
WITHOUT DELAY HE BRISKLY ATTACKED THEM AS THEY WERE DEFILING FROM A LANE AND FORMING THEMSELVES
AND THE NATION REGARDED WITH THE UTMOST ANXIETY EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS CELEBRATED TRIAL
AND CHALLENGED HIM AS THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED IN THE SAME HONORABLE CAUSE TO EXERCISE THE SAME IMPARTIAL VENGEANCE ON ALL OF THEM
THIS SUCCESS WHICH STRUCK A GREAT TERROR INTO THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY DETERMINED FAIRFAX TO LEAVE OXFORD WHICH HE WAS BEGINNING TO APPROACH
COLONEL REYNOLDS AND AFTERWARDS FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL FELL UPON THEM WHILE UNPREPARED FOR DEFENCE AND SEDUCED BY THE APPEARANCE OF A TREATY
AND BY HIS GENEROUS HUMANITY SO CRUEL A CIVIL WAR WAS ENDED IN APPEARANCE VERY CALMLY BETWEEN THE PARTIES
WITHOUT CIVILITY WITHOUT PRUDENCE
THAT EVEN IF THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE DECEIVED IN REPOSING THIS CONFIDENCE IN HIM THEY NEITHER LOST ANY THING NOR INCURRED ANY DANGER
WHEN BAILLIE AND URREY WITH THEIR WHOLE FORCE WERE UNEXPECTEDLY UPON HIM HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
457
HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD NOT NOW LEISURE TO CONSIDER A MATTER OF SO GREAT IMPORTANCE AND MUST THEREFORE RESPITE HIS ANSWER TILL HIS RETURN THE PARLIAMENT INSTANTLY DESPATCHED ANOTHER MESSAGE TO HIM WITH SOLICITATIONS STILL MORE IMPORTUNATE
BASTWIC TO SCILLY PRYNNE TO JERSEY BURTON TO GUERNSEY
BUT THE GENERAL OPINION SEEMED TO CONDEMN ALL THOSE RIGOROUS AND JEALOUS CAPITULATIONS WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
THEY TOLD HIM THAT IF HE ACCEPTED OF THE CROWN THEY WOULD INSTANTLY THROW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND NEVER AFTERWARDS SHOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO SERVE HIM THURLOE VOL
BUT THAT COURT BEING AT FIRST INSTITUTED BY A STRETCH OF ROYAL PREROGATIVE IT HAD BEEN USUAL FOR THE PRINCE TO VARY HIS INSTRUCTIONS
AND THEY CLAIMED EQUAL RIGHT WITH THE MEN OF DECLARING BY PETITION THEIR SENSE OF THE PUBLIC CAUSE
THE INDEPENDENTS REJECTED ALL ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS AND WOULD ADMIT OF NO SPIRITUAL COURTS NO GOVERNMENT AMONG PASTORS NO INTERPOSITION OF THE MAGISTRATE IN RELIGIOUS CONCERNS NO FIXED ENCOURAGEMENT ANNEXED TO ANY SYSTEM OF DOCTRINES OR OPINIONS
A KIND HUSBAND AN INDULGENT FATHER A GENTLE MASTER A STEADFAST FRIEND
AND COMING UP TO THAT PART OF THE TABLE WHERE THE BREAD AND WINE LAY HE BOWED SEVEN TIMES
65 IN THIS TREATY THE KING MANIFESTED HIS GREAT PARTS AND ABILITIES STRENGTH OF REASON AND QUICKNESS OF APPREHENSION WITH MUCH PATIENCE IN HEARING WHAT WAS OBJECTED AGAINST HIM
THEY WERE SOON INTERRUPTED BY COLONEL WHITE WITH A PARTY OF SOLDIERS
YET WERE THEY LITTLE WORSE THAN WHAT WERE INSISTED ON BEFORE THE BATTLE OF NASEBY
CHARLES LEAVING HIS BAGGAGE AND CANNON IN DENNINGTON CASTLE NEAR NEWBURY FORTHWITH RETREATED TO WALLINGFORD AND THENCE TO OXFORD
AND IN JUNE OF THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR WAS FIXED THE PERIOD FOR THE MEETING OF THAT ASSEMBLY
ARUNDEL POLLAR GRANVILLE TRELAWNEY OF PLYMOUTH AND EXETER
SUCH AN IMPATIENCE APPEARED AND SUCH AN EMULATION IN LORDS AND COMMONS AND CITY WHO SHOULD MAKE THE MOST LIVELY EXPRESSIONS OF THEIR JOY AND DUTY THAT AS THE NOBLE HISTORIAN EXPRESSES IT A MAN COULD NOT BUT WONDER WHERE THOSE PEOPLE DWELT WHO HAD DONE ALL THE MISCHIEF AND KEPT THE KING SO MANY YEARS FROM ENJOYING THE COMFORT AND SUPPORT OF SUCH EXCELLENT SUBJECTS
THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE WHO HAD AT LAST BEEN INDUCED TO JOIN THE ENGLISH HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
HE EVEN THREW HIMSELF INTO A DISSOLUTE AND DISORDERLY COURSE OF LIFE
A SMALL SUPPLY OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR COULD NEVER BE OBTAINED BY FORMER KINGS FROM THE JEALOUS HUMOR OF PARLIAMENTS
THEY CHOSE LORD GORMANSTONE THEIR LEADER
HE SUMMONED AN ASSEMBLY OF THE CLERGY AT WATERFORD AND ENGAGED THEM TO DECLARE AGAINST THAT PACIFICATION WHICH THE CIVIL COUNCIL HAD CONCLUDED WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
THE DEVOTEES OF PRESBYTERY BECAME OF COURSE ZEALOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
316
350 351 ETC
THIS DEFECT WHICH THEY CONCEALED FROM THE SOLDIERS THEY RESOLVED TO SUPPLY BY THEIR VALOR
A NUMBER WHICH THE KING DEEMED NECESSARY FOR RETAINING IRELAND IN OBEDIENCE
AND THEY TOOK CARE AFTER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH THEY HAD OBTAINED TO REDOUBLE THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF LOYALTY DUTY AND SUBMISSION TO HIS PERSON
AND WHILE THEY PASSED THEIR TIME MOSTLY AT THEIR COUNTRY SEATS THEY WERE SURPRISED TO HEAR OF OPINIONS PREVAILING WITH WHICH THEY HAD EVER BEEN UNACQUAINTED AND WHICH IMPLIED NOT A LIMITATION BUT AN ABOLITION ALMOST TOTAL OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY
A MAN IN A VISOR PERFORMED THE OFFICE OF EXECUTIONER
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS AT THIS TIME GUIDED BY TWO MEN HAZELRIG AND VANE WHO WERE OF OPPOSITE CHARACTERS AND MORTALLY HATED EACH OTHER
AND A FURIOUS HEADSTRONG BODY BROKEN LOOSE FROM THE RESTRAINT OF LAW HAD HITHERTO BEEN RETAINED IN SUBJECTION UNDER THEIR AUTHORITY AND FIRMLY UNITED BY ZEAL AND PASSION AS BY THE MOST LEGAL AND ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
THE WHOLE DISCOURSE AND LANGUAGE OF THE MODERNS WERE POLLUTED WITH MYSTERIOUS JARGON AND FULL OF THE LOWEST AND MOST VULGAR HYPOCRISY
BY THIS COMMISSION WHICH FROM THE NUMBER OF PERSONS NAMED IN IT COULD BE NO SECRET THE COMMISSIONERS WERE EMPOWERED TO MEET AND TO CONCERT AMONG THEMSELVES THE METHODS OF LEVYING MONEY BY IMPOSITIONS OR OTHERWISE
GUSTAVUS ELATED BY PROSPERITY BEGAN TO FORM MORE EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION
THE MILITIA OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES MURRAY ROSS CAITHNESS TO THE NUMBER OF FIVE THOUSAND MEN OPPOSED HIM IN FRONT AND GUARDED THE BANKS OF THE SPEY A DEEP AND RAPID RIVER

THE COURT OF YORK ABOLISHED

AND IT WAS KNOWN THAT FROM COMPLAISANCE TO THE QUEEN AND INDEED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE KING'S MAXIMS OF GOVERNMENT HE HAD GRANTED MANY INDULGENCES TO CATHOLICS AND HAD SIGNED WARRANTS FOR THE PARDON OF PRIESTS AND THEIR DELIVERY FROM CONFINEMENT
SEE CLARENDON VOL V
SINCE THE SAME INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT WHICH MADE THEM A PARLIAMENT HAD INVESTED HIM WITH THE PROTECTORSHIP
NOR WERE THEY EITHER BURDENSOME ON THE PEOPLE'S PROPERTIES OR ANYWISE SHOCKING TO THE NATURAL HUMANITY OF MANKIND
AND BESIDES THE STRANGE CORRUPTIONS ENGENDERED BY THIS SPIRIT IT ELUDED AND LOOSENED ALL THE TIES OF MORALITY AND GAVE ENTIRE SCOPE AND EVEN SANCTION TO THE SELFISHNESS AND AMBITION WHICH NATURALLY ADHERE TO THE HUMAN MIND
A COUNTRY MORE TURBULENT AND LESS DISPOSED TO SUBMISSION AND OBEDIENCE
THE MAXIMS HOWEVER OF HIS ADMINISTRATION WERE THE SAME THAT HAD EVER PREVAILED IN ENGLAND AND THAT HAD PLACE IN EVERY OTHER EUROPEAN NATION EXCEPT HOLLAND WHICH STUDIED CHIEFLY THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE AND FRANCE WHICH WAS FETTERED BY EDICTS AND TREATIES
ON FAIRFAX'S APPROACH THE SIEGE OF TAUNTON WAS RAISED
BUT YET HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD CLOSE WITH THE SCOTS SOONER THAN WITH THE OTHER
LONG-SPUN ALLEGORIES DISTANT ALLUSIONS AND FORCED CONCEITS
LAST SUMMER THE COMMONS HAD SENT UP TO THE PEERS AN IMPEACHMENT OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HER
THE POPULACE FLOCKED ABOUT WHITEHALL AND ACCOMPANIED THEIR DEMAND OF JUSTICE WITH THE LOUDEST CLAMORS AND MOST OPEN MENACES
HE HAD BEEN CAREFUL TO SUMMON IN HIS WRITS SEVERAL PERSONS ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO HIM
AND THE TWO REGIMENTS IN PALACE-YARD OBSERVING THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO DERISION PEACEABLY RETIRED TO THEIR QUARTERS
A PUNISHMENT FROM WHICH THE MEANEST ROMAN CITIZEN WAS BY THE LAWS EXEMPTED
588
588
615
A NEW METHOD OF FRAMING AND DISPERSING LIBELS WAS INVENTED BY THE LEADERS OF POPULAR DISCONTENT
AND HE SENT THEM TO ENGLAND
BUT WHAT WAS THE EVENT
AND THEY HAD A SUPERIOR RIGHT TO SEE THOSE BLESSINGS WHICH THEY HAD PURCHASED WITH THEIR BLOOD INSURED TO FUTURE GENERATIONS
EVERY PERSON OF DISTINCTION WAS AMBITIOUS OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MAJESTY
AND THE CHARACTER OF A MAN OF PLEASURE WAS AFFECTED AMONG THEM AS A SURE PLEDGE OF ATTACHMENT TO THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY
ALL THESE MEASURES SHOWED LITTLE SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION IN THE PARLIAMENT
THE PARLIAMENT,--FOR SO WE MUST HENCEFORTH CALL A SMALL AND INCONSIDERABLE PART OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,--HAVING MURDERED THEIR SOVEREIGN WITH SO MANY APPEARING CIRCUMSTANCES OF SOLEMNITY AND JUSTICE AND SO MUCH REAL VIOLENCE AND EVEN FURY BEGAN TO ASSUME MORE THE AIR OF A CIVIL LEGAL POWER AND TO ENLARGE A LITTLE THE NARROW BOTTOM UPON WHICH THEY STOOD
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THE KING MUST IMMEDIATELY GO WITH ME RESISTANCE WAS VAIN
THIS SPEECH CONTAINING MATTER WHICH WAS BOTH AGREEABLE AND DISAGREEABLE TO THE HOUSE AS WELL AS TO THE NATION STILL KEPT EVERY ONE IN SUSPENSE AND UPHELD THAT UNCERTAINTY IN WHICH IT SEEMED THE GENERAL'S INTEREST TO RETAIN THE PUBLIC
BECAUSE IT PRETENDS TO BE DATED IN OCTOBER 1641 YET MENTIONS FACTS WHICH HAPPENED NOT TILL SOME MONTHS AFTER
WAS FINED AS HAVING OPPROBRIOUSLY DEFAMED THE NOBLEMAN'S CREST BY CALLING THE SWAN A GOOSE
THE TEMPORAL LORDS CHOSE EIGHT BISHOPS
AND THEY PARTICULARLY FORBADE BOWING AT THE NAME OF JESUS
COKE WAS APPOINTED SOLICITOR FOR THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND
AND THOUGH IT WAS EASY WHERE INTEREST CONCURRED TO DECEIVE THEM BY THE THINNEST DISGUISES IT MIGHT BE FOUND DANGEROUS AT ONCE TO PULL OFF THE MASK AND TO SHOW THEM IN A FULL LIGHT THE WHOLE CRIME AND DEFORMITY OF THEIR CONDUCT
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SPIRIT OF REFORMATION SEIZED HIM
HE DISCOVERED AND DISSIPATED ALL THEIR SECRET CABALS AND CONSPIRACIES
THIS RIDICULOUS NAME WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN BY SOME POET OR ALLEGORIST TO SUIT SO RIDICULOUS A PERSONAGE STRUCK THE FANCY OF THE PEOPLE
BUT WHERE ALL THESE WERE REDUCED INTO A SYSTEM WERE EXERTED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WERE STUDIOUSLY SOUGHT FOR IN ORDER TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF LAWS AND SUBDUE THE REFRACTORY SPIRIT OF THE NATION IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIND SOME SPEEDY REMEDY OR FINALLY TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF PRESERVING THE FREEDOM OF THE CONSTITUTION
THE MAIN BODY OF THE ROYALISTS WAS COMMANDED BY THE KING HIMSELF
THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE WHO WERE AVERSE TO THE CEREMONIES AND EPISCOPAL GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH
269 279
NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL
295 343 443
OR IN OTHER WORDS TO RESIGN HIMSELF PASSIVELY TO THEIR GUIDANCE AND GOVERNMENT
NOR SHOULD HE HAVE RECOMMENCED HOSTILITIES BUT ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH ENORMOUS AND UNEXPECTED PRETENSIONS AS WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED HIS CAUSE IF POSSIBLE TO THE WHOLE ENGLISH NATION
AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION
AND THIS MAN WHOSE COMMISSION EMPOWERED HIM TO DIRECT THE SPIRITUAL CONCERNS OF THE IRISH WAS EMBOLDENED BY THEIR IGNORANCE AND BIGOTRY TO ASSUME THE CHIEF AUTHORITY IN THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT
A LAW TO HAVE ANY AUTHORITY MUST BE DERIVED FROM A LEGISLATURE WHICH HAS RIGHT
AND CROMWELL AS IF HIS POWER HAD JUST COMMENCED FROM THIS POPULAR CONSENT WAS ANEW INAUGURATED IN WESTMINSTER HALL AFTER THE MOST SOLEMN AND MOST POMPOUS MANNER
BY MEANS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND
THOUGH NEAR THIRTY SHIPS OF THE DUTCH WERE SUNK AND TAKEN THEY LITTLE REGARDED THIS LOSS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THEIR BRAVE ADMIRAL
P 474
SIR HENRY VANE OLIVER CROMWELL NATHANIEL FIENNES AND OLIVER ST JOHN THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL WERE REGARDED AS THE LEADERS OF THE INDEPENDENTS
792
THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN FURNISHED HIM WITH ARMS
THE EARL OF CLANRICARDE A NOBLEMAN OF AN ANCIENT FAMILY A PERSON TOO OF MERIT WHO HAD EVER PRESERVED HIS LOYALTY WAS SENSIBLE OF THE RUIN WHICH THREATENED HIS COUNTRYMEN AND WAS RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO PREVENT IT
IT IS MORE TO BE ADMIRED THAT HE ESCAPED WITH HIS LIFE
THEY WERE CONSTITUTED AFTER THIS MANNER
1635 CHARLES HAD IMITATED THE EXAMPLE OF ELIZABETH AND JAMES AND HAD ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS FORBIDDING THE LANDED GENTLEMEN AND THE NOBILITY TO LIVE IDLY IN LONDON AND ORDERING THEM TO RETIRE TO THEIR COUNTRY SEATS FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO THIS EDICT MANY WERE INDICTED BY THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND WERE FINED IN THE STAR CHAMBER THIS OCCASIONED DISCONTENTS
SO MUCH DID THESE PRISONERS GLORY IN THEIR SUFFERINGS THAT THOUGH THEY WERE PROMISED LIBERTY ON THAT CONDITION THEY WOULD NOT CONDESCEND EVEN TO PRESENT A PETITION TO THE KING EXPRESSING THEIR SORROW FOR HAVING OFFENDED HIM THEY UNANIMOUSLY REFUSED TO FIND SURETIES FOR THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND DISDAINED TO ACCEPT OF DELIVERANCE ON SUCH EASY TERMS
BUT I SEE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE AND THEREFORE I SHALL LEAVE IT
613
THIS WAS THE LAST AND GREATEST ACTION OF THE GALLANT BLAKE
AS THE ARMY APPROACHED RAINSBOROW BEING SENT BY THE GENERAL OVER THE RIVER PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE SOUTHWARK AND WAS GLADLY RECEIVED BY SOME SOLDIERS WHO WERE QUARTERED THERE FOR ITS DEFENCE AND WHO WERE RESOLVED NOT TO SEPARATE THEIR INTERESTS FROM THOSE OF THE ARMY
AT WELLINGTON A DAY'S MARCH FROM SHREWSBURY HE MADE A RENDEZVOUS OF ALL HIS FORCES AND CAUSED HIS MILITARY ORDERS TO BE READ AT THE HEAD OF EVERY REGIMENT
THE ARMY HAD SMALL INCLINATION TO THE SERVICE OF IRELAND
THE POPULACE MORE OUTRAGEOUS IN THEIR FESTIVITY MADE THE AIR RESOUND WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND ILLUMINATED EVERY STREET WITH SIGNALS OF JOLLITY AND TRIUMPH
290
BUT WHEN SHE BEGAN TO RENEW HER ECSTASIES WARNING OF THE HAPPY EVENT WAS CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
A TAXATION WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN IMPOSED BY ELIZABETH BUT WHICH AFTERWARDS WHEN CARRIED SOME STEPS FURTHER BY CHARLES CREATED SUCH VIOLENT DISCONTENTS
AND THEY DEMANDED THAT A PERIOD SHOULD BE PUT TO THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT THE EVENT FOR WHICH HE MOST ARDENTLY LONGED
THIS SUCCESS HASTENED THE RUIN OF THE PARLIAMENT
UNDAUNTED AND IMPLACABLE PRUDENT AND ACTIVE HE BRAVED ALL THE OPPOSITION OF THE FRENCH PRINCES AND NOBLES IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS VENGEANCE
HE WAS NOR ENDOWED WITH THE VIGOR REQUISITE FOR THE SECOND
THE SUFFERINGS WHICH FOLLOWED THE PRACTICE OF THIS DOCTRINE WERE A SPECIES OF PERSECUTION NOT WELL CALCULATED FOR PROMOTING IT
BUT ABOVE ALL THE INTRIGUES OF LAMBERT WHO WAS NOW ROUSED FROM HIS RETREAT INFLAMED ALL THOSE DANGEROUS HUMORS AND THREATENED THE NATION WITH SOME GREAT CONVULSION
AND SOME OF THE FEMALES WERE KILLED IN THE FRAY BEDFORD HOLLAND AND CONWAY HAD DESERTED THE PARLIAMENT AND HAD GONE TO OXFORD
HE WAS AMBITIOUS OF FORMING CONNECTIONS WITH THE NOBILITY
EVERY THING BORE THE APPEARANCE OF A DEFEAT INSTEAD OF A VICTORY WITH WHICH HE HAD HASTILY FLATTERED HIMSELF
CHARLES WAS AT THE HAGUE WHEN SIR JOSEPH DOUGLAS BROUGHT HIM INTELLIGENCE THAT HE WAS PROCLAIMED KING BY THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
BUT THE PARLIAMENT JUSTLY THOUGHT THAT THE KING WAS TOO EMINENT A MAGISTRATE TO BE TRUSTED WITH DISCRETIONARY POWER WHICH HE MIGHT SO EASILY TURN TO THE DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTY
BUT SINCE PROVIDENCE AND NECESSITY HAVE CAST US UPON IT I WILL PRAY TO GOD FOR A BLESSING ON YOUR COUNSELS
THE PARLIAMENT AND ARMY MEANWHILE ENJOYED NOT IN TRANQUILLITY THAT POWER WHICH THEY HAD OBTAINED WITH SO MUCH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE
THESE PRECAUTIONS THE TENDENCY OF WHICH WAS VISIBLE GAVE GREAT DISGUST TO THE GENERAL OFFICERS
THE BISHOP OF GALLOWAY WAS ATTACKED IN THE STREETS AND CHASED INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE THE PRIVY COUNCIL WAS SITTING
THESE WRITS WHEN EXAMINED ARE ONLY FOUND TO REQUIRE THE SEAPORTS SOMETIMES AT THEIR OWN CHARGE SOMETIMES AT THE CHARGE OF THE COUNTIES TO SEND THEIR SHIPS FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE NATION
AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEFEAT WHILE SCOTLAND WAS ENRAGED AND ENGLAND DISCONTENTED WERE SO DREADFUL THAT NO MOTIVE SHOULD PERSUADE HIM TO HAZARD IT
AND WHAT WAS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THE LITURGY WAS ENTIRELY ABOLISHED AND IN ITS STEAD A NEW DIRECTORY FOR WORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED
COLD IN HIS ADDRESS PLAIN IN HIS DISCOURSE INFLEXIBLE IN HIS PRINCIPLES
BUT THE MISFORTUNES ARISING FROM THESE CAUSES WERE YET REMOTE
AND THESE IF LEFT TO THEIR FREE JUDGMENT IT WAS EASILY FORESEEN WOULD REJECT THE BILL WITHOUT SCRUPLE OR DELIBERATION
LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
AND EVERY SUCCESSIVE REVOLUTION BECAME A PRECEDENT FOR THAT WHICH FOLLOWED IT
THAT WERE IT OTHERWISE YET MIGHT THEIR MEASURES BE JUSTIFIED BY THE MOST OBVIOUS AND MOST RECEIVED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY
TO THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE REGIMENTS CHAPLAINS WERE NOT APPOINTED THE OFFICERS ASSUMED THE SPIRITUAL DUTY AND UNITED IT WITH THEIR MILITARY FUNCTIONS
AN ABRUPT AND VIOLENT DISSOLUTION NATURALLY EXCITES DISCONTENTS AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO USUALLY PUT ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND EXPECT FROM THEM THE REDRESS OF ALL GRIEVANCES

THE SACRED BOUNDARIES OF THE LAWS BEING ONCE VIOLATED NOTHING REMAINED TO CONFINE THE WILD PROJECTS OF ZEAL AND AMBITION
IT WAS ENTIRELY ARBITRARY
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT AS THE PARLIAMENT ABOLISHED ALL HOLYDAYS AND SEVERELY PROHIBITED ALL AMUSEMENT ON THE SABBATH
IT WAS BY THE PRUDENCE AND LOYALTY OF GENERAL MONK THAT THIS HAPPY CHANGE WAS AT LAST ACCOMPLISHED
AND THE FURTHER ALTERATIONS ATTEMPTED BY CHARLES WERE REPRESENTED AS A PLAIN DECLARATION OF HIS INTENTIONS
WOMEN ALSO WERE ADMITTED TO TEACH THE BRETHREN AND WERE CONSIDERED AS PROPER VEHICLES TO CONVEY THE DICTATES OF THE SPIRIT
TWO VIOLENT ATTACKS HE WAS OBLIGED THIS SESSION TO SUSTAIN ONE FROM THE EARL OF BRISTOL ANOTHER FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
9 42 EDW
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE LET THEM KNOW THAT CONSIDERING THE SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS A DELAY WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO A DENIAL THE KING THOUGH THE MAJORITY WAS AGAINST HIM NEVER HAD MORE FRIENDS IN ANY HOUSE OF COMMONS
THIS TRANSACTION WAS DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT
THIS PRACTICE THEY CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME
V JOURNAL 6TH OF APRIL 1659
HIS CHAPLAINS WERE RESTORED TO HIM AND HE WAS ALLOWED THE USE OF THE LITURGY
ON ALL OCCASIONS THEY HAD NO OTHER ADVICE TO GIVE THE KING THAN TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE DIRECTED BY HIS GREAT COUNCIL
OF HOW MUCH POWER I DIVESTED MYSELF THAT I AND THEY MIGHT MEET ONCE AGAIN IN A PARLIAMENTARY WAY IN ORDER TO AGREE THE BOUNDS OF PRINCE AND PEOPLE
THE CONVERSATION BEING FINISHED THE DUKE DREW TOWARDS THE DOOR
SHE COULD NOT BE PERSUADED THAT HIS POWER OR PERSON WAS EVER IN SAFETY
THE FORMER SUSPECTED THAT THE MATTER HAD NOT BEEN PROPOSED MERELY BY CHANCE WITHOUT HIS OWN CONCURRENCE
THE PULPITS HAD EXTREMELY ASSISTED THE OFFICERS IN LEVYING RECRUITS AND HAD THUNDERED OUT ANATHEMAS AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO WENT NOT OUT TO ASSIST THE LORD AGAINST THE MIGHTY YET SO PRUDENT WERE THE LEADERS OF THE MALECONTENTS THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT SUBMISSIVE MESSAGES TO THE KING AND CRAVED TO BE ADMITTED TO A TREATY
THOUGH AS THEY WERE DERIVED FROM GOOD MOTIVES ONLY PUSHED TO AN EXTREME THERE IS ROOM LEFT TO BELIEVE THAT THE INTENTIONS OF THAT PATRIOT AS WELL AS OF MANY OF HIS PARTY WERE LAUDABLE
THE ARTICLES OF PERTH WERE CONFIRMED IN 1621
THE FOLLOWING INSTANCE OF EXTRAVAGANCE IS GIVEN BY WALKER IN HIS HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY PART II
IN THE BATTLE OF NEWBURY ON THE PART OF THE KING BESIDES THE EARLS OF SUNDERLAND AND CARNARVON TWO NOBLEMEN OF PROMISING HOPES WAS UNFORTUNATELY SLAIN TO THE REGRET OF EVERY LOVER OF INGENUITY AND VIRTUE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM LUCIUS GARY VISCOUNT FALKLAND SECRETARY OF STATE
BEING MOVED BY THE SPIRIT AS SHE SAID TO APPEAL AS A SIGN TO THE PEOPLE
THIS INTELLIGENCE GAVE THEM GREAT COMFORT AND MUCH CONFIRMED THEM IN THEIR PRESENT RESOLUTIONS WHITLOCKE P
BERKELEY CASTLE WAS TAKEN BY STORM
EVEN MINCED PIES WHICH CUSTOM HAD MADE A CHRISTMAS DISH AMONG THE CHURCHMEN WAS REGARDED DURING THAT SEASON AS A PROFANE AND SUPERSTITIOUS VIAND BY THE SECTARIES
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE THE JOY AND EXULTATION WHICH DISPLAYED ITSELF THROUGHOUT THE CITY AS SOON AS INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED OF THIS HAPPY MEASURE EMBRACED BY THE GENERAL
AND IT WAS MENTIONED BY SOME AMONG THEM THAT THE SITTING OF THIS PARLIAMENT ANY LONGER WOULD BE OF NO SERVICE TO THE NATION
AT THE SAME TIME DOUGLAS INFORMED HIM OF THE HARD CONDITIONS ANNEXED TO THE PROCLAMATION AND EXTREMELY DAMPED THAT JOY WHICH MIGHT ARISE FROM HIS BEING RECOGNIZED SOVEREIGN IN ONE OF HIS KINGDOMS
THE GROUNDLESS CHARGE OF POPERY THOUGH BELIED BY HIS WHOLE LIFE AND CONDUCT WAS CONTINUALLY URGED AGAINST THE PRISONER
DO NOT YOU BE DISHEARTENED TO TREAD IN THE SAME STEPS
HE WAS WILLING TO ABOLISH ARCHBISHOPS DEANS PREBENDS CANONS
PERHAPS SAID MOUNTNORRIS WHO WAS PRESENT AT TABLE IT WAS DONE IN REVENGE OF THAT PUBLIC AFFRONT WHICH MY LORD DEPUTY FORMERLY PUT UPON HIM
BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
AND WHEN THE WAR WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD SO EARNESTLY SOLICITED WAS AT LAST COMMENCED THE IMMEDIATE DESERTION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN COULD NOT BUT SEEM VERY UNACCOUNTABLE
AND THEY HAD A NEAR PROSPECT OF MOULDING THE GOVERNMENT INTO THAT IMAGINARY REPUBLIC WHICH HAD LONG BEEN THE OBJECT OF THEIR WISHES
THE FORCES ENLISTED IN THE WEST INDIES WERE THE MOST PROFLIGATE OF MANKIND
THE PURITANS RESTRAINED IN ENGLAND SHIPPED THEMSELVES OFF FOR AMERICA AND LAID THERE THE FOUNDATIONS OF A GOVERNMENT WHICH POSSESSED ALL THE LIBERTY BOTH CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS OF WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BEREAVED IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY
SIR SAID HARRISON THE WORK IS VERY GREAT AND DANGEROUS
AND THOUGH MUCH OF THE LANDED PROPERTY FORFEITED BY REBELLION HAD BEEN CONFERRED ON THE NEW PLANTERS A MORE THAN EQUAL RETURN HAD BEEN MADE BY THEIR INSTRUCTING THE NATIVES IN TILLAGE BUILDING MANUFACTURES AND ALL THE CIVILIZED ARTS OF LIFE THIS HAD BEEN THE COURSE OF THINGS DURING THE SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS OF CHICHESTER GRANDISON FALKLAND AND ABOVE ALL OF STRAFFORD
WHAT MADE THIS BILL APPEAR OF LESS CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE PARLIAMENT VOTED TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE FOR NO LONGER A PERIOD THAN TWO MONTHS
AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MR SELDEN AND MR PYM
FROM TRANQUILLITY CONCORD SUBMISSION SOBRIETY THEY PASSED IN AN INSTANT TO A STATE OF FACTION FANATICISM REBELLION AND ALMOST FRENZY
THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS
AND HE DISPLAYED EVERY DAY NEW ABILITIES WHICH HAD LAIN DORMANT TILL THE VERY EMERGENCE BY WHICH THEY WERE CALLED FORTH INTO ACTION
IN THEIR WAY TO LONDON THEY WERE DRAWN UP ON HOUNSLOW HEATH
IN REALITY UPON CROMWELL
BUT HE WAS NOT HEARD WITH ATTENTION
TO A WILLING MAN THERE IS NO INJURY
AND HIS ENEMIES WERE NOT RECONCILED BUT ASCRIBED ALL HIS CARESSES AND FAVORS TO ARTIFICE AND NECESSITY
THE PARLIAMENT IN THEIR VERY GRANT BLAME THE MERCHANTS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO MAKE PAYMENT TO THE CROWN
NEAR ONE HALF OF THE GOODS AND CHATTELS AND AT LEAST ONE HALF OF THE LANDS RENTS AND REVENUES OF THE KINGDOM HAD BEEN SEQUESTERED
BUT WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THIS MEASURE PROCEEDED FROM AN INTENTION OF ENCROACHING ON HIS AUTHORITY HE FAILED NOT TO REGARD THESE AIMS AS HIGHLY CRIMINAL AND TRAITOROUS
HAVING LED THE ARMY WITHOUT DELAY TO WEXFORD HE BEGAN TO BATTER THE TOWN
INSOMUCH THAT WHEN HE REMOVED FROM ONE TO ANOTHER HE WAS NOT OBLIGED TO TRANSPORT ANY THING ALONG WITH HIM
MEANWHILE THE DISTRESS OF ROCHELLE HAD RISEN TO THE UTMOST EXTREMITY
WHAT THEY WERE CHIEFLY ANXIOUS ABOUT WAS THE FIXING THE PRECISE MOMENT OF THEIR CONVERSION OR NEW BIRTH
PERHAPS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE HIS FRIENDS IF THEY THOUGHT HIM IN A SITUATION WHICH WAS NOT DISAGREEABLE TO HIM FOOTNOTE 19
THE COMMERCE WITH SPAIN SO PROFITABLE TO THE ENGLISH WAS CUT OFF
BUT WHEN HE REACHED NEWBURY HE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE KING BY HASTY MARCHES HAD ARRIVED BEFORE HIM AND WAS ALREADY POSSESSED OF THE PLACE
HE WAS THEN LORD WILLOUGHBY
AND IN THIS ARTICLE ALONE HE ASSUMED A NEGATIVE DURING THE INTERVALS OF PARLIAMENT THE PROTECTOR AND COUNCIL HAD THE POWER OF ENACTING LAWS WHICH WERE TO BE VALID TILL THE NEXT MEETING OF PARLIAMENT
690
A LITTLE BEFORE HE WAS THE IDOL OF THE PEOPLE
399 THURLOE VOL V
HE HAD MADE A CONQUEST OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN HE WAS HIMSELF AT THAT TIME AWARE OF
YET WERE THE LEADERS OF THAT PARTY VANE FIENNES ST JOHN MARTIN THE MEN IN ENGLAND THE MOST CELEBRATED FOR PROFOUND THOUGHT AND DEEP CONTRIVANCE
THE ENGLISH NATION ARE A SOBER PEOPLE HOWEVER AT PRESENT INFATUATED
THE PROTECTOR NOW FOUND THE NECESSITY OF EXACTING A SECURITY WHICH HAD HE FORESEEN THE SPIRIT OF THE HOUSE HE WOULD WITH BETTER GRACE HAVE REQUIRED AT THEIR FIRST MEETING THURLOE VOL II
AN ANCIENT PRACTICE BUT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOLISHED BY THE PETITION OF RIGHT
THIS UNUSUAL SEVERITY WAS LOUDLY EXCLAIMED AGAINST BY ALL THE PRISONERS
I CONFESS I NEVER LOOKED TO HAVE SEEN SUCH A DAY AS THIS,--IT MAY BE NOR YOU NEITHER WHEN JESUS CHRIST SHOULD BE SO OWNED AS HE IS AT THIS DAY AND IN THIS WORK
A RETREAT VERY LITTLE HONORABLE WHICH THE EARL OF HOLLAND WITH A CONSIDERABLE DETACHMENT OF THE ENGLISH FORCES HAD MADE BEFORE A DETACHMENT OF THE SCOTTISH CAUSED ALL THESE HUMORS TO BLAZE UP AT ONCE
THE OFFICERS HAD MORE REPUTATION AND EXPERIENCE
SPAIN HAVING LONG COURTED IN VAIN THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE SUCCESSFUL USURPER WAS REDUCED AT LAST TO APPLY TO THE UNFORTUNATE PRINCE
MONK THOUGH INFORMED OF THE RESTORATION OF THE PARLIAMENT FROM WHOM HE RECEIVED NO ORDERS STILL ADVANCED WITH HIS ARMY WHICH WAS NEAR SIX THOUSAND MEN
SOME HOUSES AND SHOPS LIKEWISE WERE PULLED DOWN AND COMPENSATION WAS MADE TO THE OWNERS.[V RUSH
CHAP II P
AND THANKS WERE GIVEN HIM BY LENTHAL FOR THE EMINENT SERVICES WHICH HE HAD DONE HIS COUNTRY
BUT HE WELL KNEW THAT ALMOST THE WHOLE GARRISON WAS ENGLISH
AND IN REVENGE THAT POLITIC AND ENTERPRISING MINISTER CAREFULLY FOMENTED THE FIRST COMMOTIONS IN SCOTLAND AND SECRETLY SUPPLIED THE COVENANTERS WITH MONEY AND ARMS IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM IN THEIR OPPOSITION AGAINST THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND THE ABRUPT DISSOLUTION OF THAT PARLIAMENT AS ABOVE RELATED PUT AN END FOR THE TIME TO THEIR FURTHER PRETENSIONS
IN THIS VIEW LIKEWISE THE SINKING OF THE VALUE OF SUBSIDIES MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A LOSS TO THE KING
AS HE PASSED FROM BREDA TO THE HAGUE HE WAS ATTENDED BY NUMEROUS CROWDS AND WAS RECEIVED WITH THE LOUDEST ACCLAMATIONS
660
BUT THERE STILL WERE A FEW WHO ABSTRACTING FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE WERE ABLE TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION IN GENERAL AND WERE INCLINED TO MODERATE NOT CONTRADICT THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT
DESIROUS OF IMPROVING HIS MARTIAL GENIUS HE TOOK A JOURNEY TO GERMANY WAS CARESSED BY THE EMPEROR RECEIVED THE RANK OF MARESCHAL AND PROPOSED TO LEVY A REGIMENT FOR THE IMPERIAL SERVICE
WOULD HE ALSO WHO WAS STRAFFORD'S INTIMATE FRIEND NEVER HAVE HEARD OF THE FORGERY
THE PARLIAMENT FORCED FROM THEIR TEMPORIZING MEASURES AND OBLIGED TO RESIGN AT ONCE OR COMBAT FOR THEIR LIBERTY AND POWER PREPARED THEMSELVES WITH VIGOR FOR DEFENCE AND DETERMINED TO RESIST THE VIOLENCE OF THE ARMY
WHO CAN DRAW AN EXACT LINE BETWEEN THE SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL POWERS IN CATHOLIC STATES
AND THE FRENCH MONARCHY HAVING LOST A FEW OF ITS CONQUESTS RETURNED WITH FRESH VIGOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF NEW DOMINION
THEIR REAR-ADMIRAL WAS BOARDED AND TAKEN
AND THREE DAUGHTERS
TRANQUIL FROM THEIR IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE THESE MEN INDULGED THEMSELVES IN THE MOST PROFOUND REPOSE ON THE VERY BRINK OF DESTRUCTION
AND AFTER ALL IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A CRUDE AND UNDIGESTED MODEL OF GOVERNMENT
HOW GREAT GLORY THE LORD HAD RECEIVED THEREBY
THE VETERAN TROOPS OF FERDINAND CONDUCTED BY THE MOST CELEBRATED GENERALS OF THE AGE WERE FOILED IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
TO THEIR CARE AND WISDOM THEREFORE HE SAID HE COMMITTED THE CONDUCT AND PROSECUTION OF THE WAR WHICH IN A CAUSE SO IMPORTANT TO NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS INTERESTS MUST OF NECESSITY BE IMMEDIATELY ENTERED UPON AND VIGOROUSLY PURSUED CLARENDON VOL
WHEN HE BEHELD THE BREAD HE SUDDENLY LET FALL THE NAPKIN FLEW BACK A STEP OR TWO BOWED THREE SEVERAL TIMES TOWARDS THE BREAD

AFTER ALL THESE WERE GRANTED IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PROCEED TO THE DISCUSSION OF THOSE OTHER DEMANDS STILL MORE EXORBITANT WHICH A LITTLE BEFORE HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED TO THE KING AT OXFORD
543 548
BY HIMSELF OR HIS MINISTERS HE ENTERED INTO A PARTICULAR DETAIL BOTH OF THE ALLIANCES WHICH HE HAD FORMED AND OF THE MILITARY OPERATIONS WHICH HE HAD PROJECTED DUGDALE P
APPLAUSES OF THE GENERAL WERE EVERY WHERE INTERMINGLED WITH DETESTATION AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT THE MOST RIDICULOUS INVENTIONS WERE ADOPTED IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THIS LATTER PASSION
AND WHAT IS MORE ALL HER NEIGHBORS ARE ENGAGED IN FURIOUS AND BLOODY WARS AMONG THEMSELVES AND BY THEIR MUTUAL ENMITIES FURTHER INSURE THEIR TRANQUILLITY
AND MOST OF THEM RETIRED BEYOND SEA
I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
AND BEFORE THEY WOULD DEIGN TO TREAT THEY DEMANDED HIS POSITIVE ASSENT TO ALL OF THEM
THE REASON ASSIGNED BY SIR PHILIP WARWICK P
THE SPEECH WHICH HE MADE WAS AS FOLLOWS
TO EXECUTE UPON THEM THE JUDGMENTS WRITTEN
THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY IN IRELAND DEVOLVED ON LIEUTENANT-GENERAL LUDLOW
I WONDER TO HEAR IF THAT BE TRUE THAT SOME OF MY FRIENDS SAY THAT MY GOING TO JERSEY WOULD HAVE MUCH MORE FURTHERED MY PERSONAL TREATY THAN MY COMING HITHER FOR WHICH AS I SEE NO COLOR OF REASON SO I HAD NOT BEEN HERE IF I HAD THOUGHT THAT FANCY TRUE OR HAD NOT BEEN SECURED OF A PERSONAL TREATY
THAT AN ENTERPRISE CORRESPONDENT TO MEN'S EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE UNDERTAKEN THE PRINCE RESOLVED TO LAY SIEGE TO BRISTOL THE SECOND TOWN FOR RICHES AND GREATNESS IN THE KINGDOM
AFTER A BATTLE OF TWO DAYS IN THE FIRST OF WHICH DEAN WAS KILLED THE DUTCH INFERIOR IN THE SIZE OF THEIR SHIPS WERE OBLIGED WITH GREAT LOSS TO RETIRE INTO THEIR HARBORS
AND BY INTIMATIONS FROM THIS COMMITTEE WHO ENTERED INTO CLOSE CONFEDERACY WITH THE POPULAR LEADERS IN ENGLAND WAS EVERY MEASURE OF THE IRISH PARLIAMENT GOVERNED AND DIRECTED
SOME OF THESE ARTICLES OF ACCUSATION MEN SAID TO JUDGE BY APPEARANCE SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
BUT THOUGH PROTESTANTS AND EVEN PRESBYTERIANS THEY MET WITH A BAD RECEPTION FROM THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO A SANCTITY SO MUCH SUPERIOR
TO BEREAVE OF HIS LIFE A MAN NOT CONDEMNED BY ANY LEGAL TRIAL IS SO EGREGIOUS AN EXERCISE OF TYRANNY THAT IT MUST AT ONCE SHOCK THE NATURAL HUMANITY OF PRINCES AND CONVEY AN ALARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMMONWEALTH
AND THE DEBATE WAS CARRIED ON FOR TWO DAYS WITH GREAT ZEAL AND WARMTH ON BOTH SIDES
BY REGULAR ECONOMY HE HAD NOT ONLY PAID ALL THE DEBTS CONTRACTED DURING THE SPANISH AND FRENCH WARS BUT HAD AMASSED A SUM OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE RESERVED FOR ANY SUDDEN EXIGENCY
AND HE WAS FOND OF FORMING A CONFEDERACY WITH A PROTESTANT POWER OF SUCH RENOWN EVEN THOUGH IT THREATENED THE WHOLE NORTH WITH CONQUEST AND SUBJECTION
THE SAME TOPICS WERE ENFORCED BY SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH
AND BY AN INCONVENIENCE COMMON TO ALL FACTIOUS TIMES OWED THEIR ADVANCEMENT TO NOTHING BUT THEIR ZEAL FOR THE PARTY BY WHOM EVERY THING WAS NOW GOVERNED
A VOTE THEREFORE WAS PASSED WITHOUT OPPOSITION AGAINST ARBITRARY IMPRISONMENTS AND FORCED LOANS AND THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY HAVING OBTAINED SOME CONTENTMENT BY THIS EXERTION THE REITERATED MESSAGES OF THE KING WHO PRESSED FOR SUPPLY WERE ATTENDED TO WITH MORE TEMPER
COLONEL URREY A SCOTCHMAN WHO SERVED IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY HAVING RECEIVED SOME DISGUST CAME TO OXFORD AND OFFERED HIS SERVICES TO THE KING
BECAUSE THE NEW SETTLEMENT JEALOUS AND INSECURE MUST COMMONLY BE SUPPORTED WITH MORE EXPENSE AND SEVERITY THAN THE OLD
VIRTUE CITY ROAD AND IVY LANE NEW YORK
245 255
BUCKINGHAM'S CONDUCT AND CHARACTER WITH SOME HAD AFFORDED A REASON WITH OTHERS A PRETENCE FOR DISCONTENT AGAINST PUBLIC MEASURES BUT AFTER HIS DEATH THERE WANTED NOT NEW REASONS AND NEW PRETENCES FOR GENERAL DISSATISFACTION
THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE RECEIVED GAVE LITTLE HOPES OF SUCCESS
THEREFORE AM I COME TO TELL YOU THAT I MUST HAVE THESE MEN WHERESOEVER I CAN FIND THEM
THE ROYALISTS THOUGH THEY COULD NOT LOVE THE MAN WHO HAD IMBRUED HIS HANDS IN THE BLOOD OF THEIR SOVEREIGN EXPECTED MORE LENITY FROM HIM THAN FROM THE JEALOUS AND IMPERIOUS REPUBLICANS WHO HAD HITHERTO GOVERNED
AND STRUCK SUCH DREAD INTO THE REST THAT THEY PRESENTLY THREW DOWN THE SYMBOLS OF SEDITION WHICH THEY HAD DISPLAYED AND THENCEFORTH RETURNED TO THEIR WONTED DISCIPLINE AND OBEDIENCE CROMWELL HAD GREAT DEFERENCE FOR THE COUNSELS OF IRETON A MAN WHO HAVING GRAFTED THE SOLDIER ON THE LAWYER THE STATESMAN ON THE SAINT HAD ADOPTED SUCH PRINCIPLES AS WERE FITTED TO INTRODUCE THE SEVEREST TYRANNY WHILE THEY SEEMED TO ENCOURAGE THE MOST UNBOUNDED LICENSE IN HUMAN SOCIETY
THE PRETENSIONS WITH REGARD TO TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WERE REVIVED AND WITH CERTAIN ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS BY THE COMMONS RUSH VOL
THE TRIUMPH OF THE MALECONTENTS OVER THE CHURCH WAS NOT YET SO IMMEDIATE OR CERTAIN
AND BY A FORMAL DEED OR ASSIGNMENT RESTORED INTO HIS HANDS THAT SUPREME AUTHORITY WHICH THEY HAD SO LATELY RECEIVED FROM HIM
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MORE JOINED THEM FROM BARBADOES AND ST CHRISTOPHER'S
AFTER THE ARMY HAD EXPELLED THE PARLIAMENT HE PROTESTED AGAINST THE VIOLENCE AND RESOLVED AS HE PRETENDED TO VINDICATE THEIR INVADED PRIVILEGES
ALLISON HAD REPORTED THAT THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK HAD INCURRED THE KING'S DISPLEASURE BY ASKING A LIMITED TOLERATION FOR THE CATHOLICS AND AN ALLOWANCE TO BUILD SOME CHURCHES FOR THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RELIGION

AND A GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND A PARLIAMENT BE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED IN ORDER TO COMPOSE ALL DIFFERENCES WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHICH ENGAGED THE KING TO ADMIT SUCH STRANGE ARTICLES OF PEACE IT IS IN VAIN TO INQUIRE
THEY KNEW THAT ALL THE MONEY GRANTED BY THE LAST PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN EXPENDED ON NAVAL AND MILITARY ARMAMENTS
THOSE WHO WERE FREE FROM THE RESTRAINT OF PRINCIPLE MIGHT BETRAY FROM INTEREST THAT CAUSE IN WHICH FROM NO BETTER MOTIVES THEY HAD ENLISTED THEMSELVES
SEIZED ALL THEIR TENTS BAGGAGE AMMUNITION
THEY ESTABLISHED THE MAXIMS OF RIGID LAW AND LIBERTY
THAT PRINCE TALKING OF ENGLISH AFFAIRS BROKE OUT INTO ADMIRATION OF CROMWELL'S COURAGE AND CAPACITY
THE MORE TO SOFTEN THEM IT WAS CONCERTED BY SIR ROBERT COTTON'S ADVICE THAT BUCKINGHAM SHOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON THAT PROPOSED IN COUNCIL THE CALLING OF A NEW PARLIAMENT
IF YOU EXAMINE THEM AND UNDER SUCH SEVERE PENALTIES BY EVERY GRAIN BY EVERY LITTLE WEIGHT THE SCRUTINY WILL BE INTOLERABLE
231
ON THE BISHOP'S APPROACH TO THE WEST DOOR OF THE CHURCH A LOUD VOICE CRIED OPEN OPEN YE EVERLASTING DOORS THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY ENTER IN IMMEDIATELY THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH FLEW OPEN AND THE BISHOP ENTERED
HE EVEN YIELDED TO THEM THE RIGHT OF RESUMING AT ANY TIME AFTERWARDS THIS AUTHORITY WHENEVER THEY SHOULD DECLARE SUCH A RESUMPTION NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
ACCORDING TO THEIR PRINCIPLES EACH CONGREGATION UNITED VOLUNTARILY AND BY SPIRITUAL TIES COMPOSED WITHIN ITSELF A SEPARATE CHURCH AND EXERCISED A JURISDICTION BUT ONE DESTITUTE OF TEMPORAL SANCTIONS OVER ITS OWN PASTOR AND ITS OWN MEMBERS

AND HIS APOSTLES IN ZEAL THOUGH NOT IN UNANIMITY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN A FULL MATCH FOR THE CATHOLICS
IN SOME IT MAY BE LIABLE TO CENSURE
THAT EXPRESSION OF THE KING'S BY WHICH HE COMMITTED TO THEM THE CARE OF IRELAND THEY IMMEDIATELY LAID HOLD OF AND INTERPRETED IN THE MOST UNLIMITED SENSE
AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT THEREFORE FORMERLY SO UNKIND AND INTRACTABLE MUST NOW AFTER ABOVE ELEVEN YEARS INTERMISSION AFTER THE KING HAD TRIED MANY IRREGULAR METHODS OF TAXATION AFTER MULTIPLIED DISGUSTS GIVEN TO THE PURITANICAL PARTY BE SUMMONED TO ASSEMBLE AMIDST THE MUST PRESSING NECESSITIES OF THE CROWN
TIS CHIEFLY SAID SHE BECAUSE I HATE TO TRAVEL IN A CROWD THE MEANING OF THIS EXPRESSION BEING DEMANDED SHE REPLIED I PERCEIVE YOUR GRACE AND MANY OTHERS ARE MAKING HASTE TO ROME
BUT SUCH APPREHENSIONS WERE ENTERTAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THE POPULAR TUMULTS THAT ONLY FORTY-FIVE WERE PRESENT WHEN THE BILL OF ATTAINDER WAS BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE
AND HE ENDEAVORED TO DRAW THOSE WHO HAD ENTERTAINED LIKE SENTIMENTS INTO A BOND OF ASSOCIATION FOR HIS MASTER'S SERVICE
I SAY I WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THAT IN THIS ARGUMENT I DO NOT MAKE PARALLEL BETWIXT MEN OF A DIFFERENT MIND AND A PARLIAMENT WHICH SHALL HAVE THEIR DESIRES
WHEN HE CONSIDERED ALL THESE INCREASING ACTS OF INSOLENCE IN THE COMMONS HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY
AND THOUGH ONE EXPRESSION OF THAT BILL MAY SEEM AMBIGUOUS THEY EMPLOY THE PLAINEST TERMS IN CALLING TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE THE KING'S DUE EVEN BEFORE THAT DUTY WAS CONFERRED ON HIM BY PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORITY FOUR REIGNS AND ABOVE A WHOLE CENTURY HAD SINCE ELAPSED
THEIR FORCES WERE SO NEARLY COUNTERPOISED THAT NO APPREHENSIONS WERE ENTERTAINED OF ANY EVENT WHICH COULD SUDDENLY DISTURB THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THEM
IT WAS A SUPERSTITIOUS REMARK OF THE ROYALISTS THAT HE WAS KILLED ON ST CHAD'S DAY BY A SHOT FROM ST CHAD'S CATHEDRAL WHICH PIERCED THAT VERY EYE BY WHICH HE HOPED TO SEE THE RUIN OF ALL CATHEDRALS
AND BY DEPRIVING HIM OF ALL POWER OF SELF-DEFENCE ARE THE REAL CAUSE WHY THE COMMONS ARE EMBOLDENED TO RAISE PRETENSIONS HITHERTO UNHEARD OF IN THE KINGDOM AND TO SUBVERT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF THE CONSTITUTION
VENGEANCE WAS FULLY TAKEN FOR THE LONG SILENCE AND CONSTRAINT IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF LAUD AND THE HIGH COMMISSION THESE PREACHERS HAD BEEN RETAINED
THAT EVEN THE RIGOR OF THOSE PRINCIPLES PROFESSED BY HIS FATHER THOUGH WITH SOME IT HAD EXALTED HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN EXTREMELY PREJUDICIAL TO HIS INTERESTS

BUT AFTER THAT TEMPEST WAS PAST LUCAS WHO COMMANDED THE ROYALISTS IN THIS WING RESTORING ORDER TO HIS BROKEN FORCES MADE A FURIOUS ATTACK ON THE PARLIAMENTARY CAVALRY THREW THEM INTO DISORDER PUSHED THEM UPON THEIR OWN INFANTRY AND PUT THAT WHOLE WING TO ROUT

WHEN THE COMMONS ASSEMBLED THEY APPEARED TO BE MEN OF THE SAME INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WITH THEIR PREDECESSORS AND POSSESSED OF SUCH RICHES THAT THEIR PROPERTY WAS COMPUTED TO SURPASS THREE TIMES THAT OF THE HOUSE OF PEERS THEY WERE DEPUTED BY BOROUGHS AND COUNTIES INFLAMED ALL OF THEM BY THE LATE VIOLATIONS OF LIBERTY
THE DECLARATION BY WHICH THE MILITARY PETITIONERS HAD BEEN VOTED PUBLIC ENEMIES WAS RECALLED AND ERASED FROM THE JOURNAL BOOK THIS WAS THE FIRST SYMPTOM WHICH THE PARLIAMENT GAVE OF SUBMISSION
ONE OF THEM REPLIED I'LL WARRANT YOU SIR WE'LL HIT YOU HE ANSWERED SMILING FRIENDS I HAVE BEEN NEARER YOU WHEN YOU HAVE MISSED ME THUS PERISHED THIS GENEROUS SPIRIT NOT LESS BELOVED FOR HIS MODESTY AND HUMANITY THAN ESTEEMED FOR HIS COURAGE AND MILITARY CONDUCT
IN THESE RIGID OPINIONS THE WHOLE SECTARIES AMIDST ALL THEIR OTHER DIFFERENCES UNANIMOUSLY CONCURRED
THE SESSIONS WERE SHORT AND THE MEMBERS HAD NO LEISURE EITHER TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH PUBLIC BUSINESS
HARRISON RICH OVERTON AND A FEW OTHERS WHO RETAINED SOME PRINCIPLE WERE GUIDED BY NOTIONS SO EXTRAVAGANT THAT THEY WERE EASILY DELUDED INTO MEASURES THE MOST VIOLENT AND MOST CRIMINAL

SUCCORS TO THEMSELVES AND SUPPLIES OF ARMS THEY EXPECTED FROM FRANCE IN CONSEQUENCE OF A PROMISE MADE THEM BY CARDINAL RICHELIEU
THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL FAIRFAX ATTACKED AND DEFEATED THE ROYALISTS COMMANDED BY BIRON AND TOOK COLONEL MONK PRISONER
AFFAIRS INDEED WERE BROUGHT TO THAT PASS BY THE FURIOUS ANIMOSITIES OF THE SEVERAL FACTIONS THAT THE EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AND EVEN ARBITRARY POWER OF SOME FIRST MAGISTRATE WAS BECOME A NECESSARY EVIL IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PEOPLE FROM RELAPSING INTO BLOOD AND CONFUSION
THEY EXAMINED AND ADMITTED SUCH PERSONS AS RECEIVED HOLY ORDERS
IN SOME OF THESE DECLARATIONS SUPPOSED TO BE PENNED BY LORD FALKLAND IS FOUND THE FIRST REGULAR DEFINITION OF THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO OUR PRESENT IDEAS OF IT THAT OCCURS IN ANY ENGLISH COMPOSITION
SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN THAT THE PEOPLE MIGHT BE THE MORE ENABLED BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM
HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
AND THUS EPISCOPACY THE HIGH COMMISSION THE ARTICLES OF PERTH THE CANONS AND THE LITURGY WERE ABOLISHED AND DECLARED UNLAWFUL
AND HE AGREED THAT ALL THE DEBTS CONTRACTED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE WAR AGAINST HIM SHOULD BE PAID BY THE PEOPLE
AND REACHED AT LAST AN EQUALITY OF POWER WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
THE KING TOLD THEM THAT THE EARL OF GLAMORGAN HAVING MADE AN OFFER TO RAISE FORCES IN THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND AND TO CONDUCT THEM INTO ENGLAND FOR HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE HAD A COMMISSION TO THAT PURPOSE AND TO THAT PURPOSE ONLY
AND BEING DESIROUS OF RETURNING HOME IN HIS RETINUE THEY JOINED THE OPINION OF THE YOUNG DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AND EARNESTLY PRESSED HIM TO SUBMIT TO THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED OF HIM
AND WITHOUT DELAY HE WENT TO SCARBOROUGH WHERE HE FOUND A VESSEL WHICH CARRIED HIM BEYOND SEA
ESSEX'S ARMY COOPED UP IN A NARROW CORNER AT LESTITHIEL DEPRIVED OF ALL FORAGE AND PROVISIONS AND SEEING NO PROSPECT OF SUCCOR WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY
THE CORNISH IN THREE DIVISIONS ATTACKED THE WEST SIDE WITH A RESOLUTION WHICH NOTHING COULD CONTROL
HIS AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE DURING THE TIME OF HIS GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN UNLIMITED
WHEN THIS DEMAND WAS MADE,--A DEMAND WHICH IF GRANTED THE COMMONS JUSTLY REGARDED AS THE LAST THEY SHOULD EVER HAVE OCCASION TO MAKE,--HE WAS AT DOVER ATTENDING THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCESS OF ORANGE IN THEIR EMBARKATION
AND THOSE OF THE ENGLISH IN PART
BUT HE RETURNED WITHOUT EFFECTING ANY THING
IN SOME PARTICULARS THEIR INDUSTRY WAS LAUDABLE
ONLY THREE DAYS INTERVAL WAS ALLOWED HIM
OR ANY OTHER INCIDENT HOWEVER CALAMITOUS THAT MIGHT SECURE THE PEOPLE AGAINST THESE OPPRESSIONS WHICH THEY FELT OR THE GREATER ILLS WHICH THEY APPREHENDED FROM THE COMBINED ENCROACHMENTS OF CHURCH AND STATE
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT HOWEVER NEGLECTED NOT SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY OF REVIVING THE OLD CLAMOR WITH REGARD TO THE KING'S FAVOR OF POPERY AND ACCUSED HIM OF DELIVERING OVER IN A MANNER THE WHOLE KINGDOM OF IRELAND TO THAT HATED SECT
AND AFTER GREAT OPPOSITION AND MANY VEHEMENT DEBATES IT WAS AT LENGTH WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY CARRIED BY THE COURT PARTY TO CONFIRM IT
THE WHOLE KINGDOM WAS IN A MANNER ENGAGED AND THE MEN OF GREATEST ABILITIES SOON ACQUIRED THE ASCENDANT WHICH THEIR FAMILY INTEREST ENABLED THEM TO MAINTAIN
THE INDEPENDENTS AMIDST THEIR EMPTY DREAMS OF LIBERTY OR RATHER OF DOMINION WERE OPPRESSED BY THE REBELLION OF THEIR OWN SERVANTS AND FOUND THEMSELVES AT ONCE EXPOSED TO THE INSULTS OF POWER AND HATRED OF THE PEOPLE
THE KING WOULD INDULGE NO REFINEMENTS OF CASUISTRY HOWEVER PLAUSIBLE IN SUCH DELICATE SUBJECTS
HAMILTON HAVING ENTERED ENGLAND WITH A NUMEROUS THOUGH UNDISCIPLINED ARMY DURST NOT UNITE HIS FORCES WITH THOSE OF LANGDALE
NOR TO RENDER A REVENUE ONCE PRECARIOUS WHICH PERHAPS THEY MIGHT NEVER AFTERWARDS BE ABLE TO GET REESTABLISHED ON THE OLD FOOTING FOOTNOTE 4
NOW WAS LED FORTH AMIDST THE INSULTS OF HIS ENEMIES AND THE TEARS OF THE PEOPLE THIS MAN OF ILLUSTRIOUS BIRTH AND OF THE GREATEST RENOWN IN THE NATION TO SUFFER FOR HIS ADHERING TO THE LAWS OF HIS COUNTRY AND THE RIGHTS OF HIS SOVEREIGN THE IGNOMINIOUS DEATH DESTINED TO THE MEANEST MALEFACTOR
AFTER A SHARP CONFLICT WHERE MONTROSE EXERTED GREAT VALOR HIS FORCES WERE ROUTED BY LESLY'S CAVALRY AND HE HIMSELF WAS OBLIGED TO FLY WITH HIS BROKEN FORCES INTO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE HE AGAIN PREPARED HIMSELF FOR NEW BATTLES AND NEW ENTERPRISES THE COVENANTERS USED THE VICTORY WITH RIGOR
WHAT REASON UPON THAT SUPPOSITION HAD THEY TO BLAME EITHER THE PRINCE OR BUCKINGHAM FOR THEIR CONDUCT OR FOR THE NARRATIVE DELIVERED TO THE PARLIAMENT
THE HOLLANDERS WERE REGARDED AS WORLDLY-MINDED MEN INTENT ONLY ON COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY
TO AFFIRM THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT TO BE A USURPATION TO ASSERT THAT THE PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL OF STATE WERE TYRANNICAL OR ILLEGAL TO ENDEAVOR SUBVERTING THEIR AUTHORITY OR STIRRING UP SEDITION AGAINST THEM
THE PLEA OF NECESSITY WOULD WARRANT ANY OTHER TAXATION AS WELL AS THAT OF SHIP MONEY
EVERY DISCRETIONARY ACT OF COUNCIL WAS REPRESENTED AS ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL
FROM HIS POCKETS ALSO HE SCATTERED PAMPHLETS SAID TO BE SEDITIOUS BECAUSE THEY ATTACKED THE HIERARCHY
AND CONDEMNED FOR TREASON
A SECRET RECONCILIATION THEREFORE WAS MADE BETWEEN THE RIVAL PARTIES
ALL THE CHIEF OFFICES IN THE COURTS OF JUDICATURE WERE FILLED WITH MEN OF INTEGRITY
BEWARE AND AT THESE WORDS HE LAID HIS HAND ON HIS SWORD BEWARE LEST DESPAIR CAUSE THEM TO SEEK SAFETY BY SOME OTHER MEANS THAN BY ADHERING TO YOU WHO KNOW NOT HOW TO CONSULT YOUR OWN SAFETY SUCH ARGUMENTS PREVAILED
AND THOUGH THE PEERS HAD HERE GONE NO FURTHER THAN OFFERING ADVICE THE LOWER HOUSE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT PROPER TO VOTE SO UNPRECEDENTED AN INTERPOSITION TO BE A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE CHARLES IN ORDER TO BRING THE MATTER OF SUPPLY TO SOME ISSUE SOLICITED THE HOUSE BY NEW MESSAGES
THE OWNING OF THE KING'S QUARREL BY MANY WITHOUT SUBORDINATION TO RELIGION AND LIBERTY
HAD CROMWELL BEEN GUILTY OF NO CRIME BUT THIS TEMPORARY USURPATION THE PLEA OF NECESSITY AND PUBLIC GOOD WHICH HE ALLEGED MIGHT BE ALLOWED IN EVERY VIEW A REASONABLE EXCUSE FOR HIS CONDUCT
AND AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE
THE ZEALOUS REPUBLICANS IN THE PARLIAMENT HAD NOT BEEN THE CHIEF OR FIRST PROMOTERS OF THE WAR
STRAFFORD FIRST AS DEPUTY THEN AS LORD LIEUTENANT HAD GOVERNED IRELAND DURING EIGHT YEARS WITH GREAT VIGILANCE ACTIVITY AND PRUDENCE BUT WITH VERY LITTLE POPULARITY
STIMULATED EQUALLY BY REVENGE BY AMBITION AND BY CONSCIENCE THEY STILL HARBORED IN THEIR BREAST SOME DESPERATE PROJECT
THAT THOUGH HE DESIRED SUCH IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AS MIGHT PREVENT FOR THE TIME A TOTAL DISORDER IN THE GOVERNMENT HE WAS FAR FROM ANY INTENTION OF PRECLUDING THEM FROM THEIR RIGHT TO INQUIRE INTO THE STATE OF THE KINGDOM AND TO OFFER HIS PETITIONS FOR THE REDRESS OF THEIR GRIEVANCES
IN CARRYING UP THE BILL TO THE LORDS ST JOHN THE SOLICITOR-GENERAL ADVANCED TWO TOPICS WELL SUITED TO THE FURY OF THE TIMES
YOU MAY PERCEIVE THAT ALL MEN INTRUST THEIR TREASURE WHERE IT RETURNS THEM INTEREST
76 77
AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE INDEPENDENTS AND ARMY THEY NEGLECTED THIS OFFER AND FRAMED FOUR PROPOSALS WHICH THEY SENT HIM AS PRELIMINARIES
HE PLACED HIS SOLDIERS IN THE STREETS WHICH LED TO WESTMINSTER HALL
AND HE FANCIED THAT HE SHOULD DO HEAVEN ACCEPTABLE SERVICE IF AT ONE BLOW HE DESPATCHED THIS DANGEROUS FOE TO RELIGION AND TO HIS COUNTRY FULL OF THESE DARK VIEWS HE SECRETLY ARRIVED AT PORTSMOUTH AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE DUKE AND WATCHED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EFFECTING HIS BLOODY PURPOSE
AND NOT RETAINING MUCH AUTHORITY IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO EMPLOY ANY EXPEDIENT WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR PURPOSE
LORD FAUCONBERG CROMWELL'S SON-IN-LAW WAS DESPATCHED TO LOUIS THEN IN THE CAMP BEFORE DUNKIRK
IT IS PROPER TO REMARK THAT THIS LAST INCIDENT HAPPENED EARLY IN THE REIGN OF JAMES
FROM FRANCE A VIGOROUS RESISTANCE MUST BE EXPECTED

THERE IS SIR BUT ONE STAGE MORE WHICH THOUGH TURBULENT AND TROUBLESOME IS YET A VERY SHORT ONE
THAT HE MIGHT WEAN HIMSELF FROM SUBLUNARY OBJECTS HE BROKE OFF ALL CONNECTIONS WITH HIS FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NEVER DWELT A MOMENT IN ONE PLACE
CROMWELL AFTER GIVING AN AMPLE CHARACTER OF THE VALOR GOOD AFFECTIONS AND GODLINESS OF THE ARMY SUBJOINED THAT IT WAS EXPECTED THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD GUIDE AND DEFEND THE KINGDOM BY THEIR OWN POWER AND RESOLUTIONS AND NOT ACCUSTOM THE PEOPLE ANY LONGER TO EXPECT SAFETY AND GOVERNMENT FROM AN OBSTINATE MAN WHOSE HEART GOD HAD HARDENED
MEN NOW CEASED TO WONDER WHY LAMBERT HAD PROMOTED HIM TO THE OFFICE OF GENERAL AND HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THE SECOND COMMAND IN THE ARMY

BLAKE THOUGH HIS SQUADRON CONSISTED ONLY OF FIFTEEN VESSELS REENFORCED AFTER THE BATTLE BEGAN BY EIGHT UNDER CAPTAIN BOURNE MAINTAINED THE FIGHT WITH BRAVERY FOR FIVE HOURS AND SUNK ONE SHIP OF THE ENEMY AND TOOK ANOTHER
BY GRANTING THIS DUTY TO EACH PRINCE DURING HIS OWN LIFE AND FOR A YEAR AFTER HIS DEMISE TO THE SUCCESSOR ALL INCONVENIENCIES HAD BEEN OBVIATED
THE CREDIT WHICH IN THEIR LAST EXPEDITION THEY HAD ACQUIRED BY OBLIGING THEIR SOVEREIGN TO DEPART FROM ALL HIS PRETENSIONS GAVE COURAGE TO EVERY ONE IN UNDERTAKING THIS NEW ENTERPRISE RUSH VOL
MANY TOO OF LOW CONDITION WHO HAD SHOWN A REFRACTORY DISPOSITION WERE PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE AND ENLISTED IN THE FLEET OR ARMY SIR PETER HAYMAN FOR THE SAME REASON WAS DESPATCHED ON AN ERRAND TO THE PALATINATE GLANVILLE AN EMINENT LAWYER HAD BEEN OBLIGED DURING THE FORMER INTERVAL OF PARLIAMENT TO ACCEPT OF AN OFFICE IN THE NAVY.[V THE SOLDIERS ILL PAID AND UNDISCIPLINED COMMITTED MANY CRIMES AND OUTRAGES AND MUCH INCREASED THE PUBLIC DISCONTENTS
BUT IT HAD LATELY SINCE THE KING'S FALL BECOME TOTALLY CONTEMPTIBLE
BUT AS THE PARLIAMENTARY AND SCOTTISH FORCES WERE NOT NUMEROUS ENOUGH TO INVEST SO LARGE A TOWN DIVIDED BY A RIVER THEY CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH INCOMMODING IT BY A LOOSE BLOCKADE

A DELICATE QUESTION THIS AND WHAT SURELY COULD NOT BE DECIDED BY PRECEDENT
THE PREACHERS NEXT SUNDAY EXCLAIMED AGAINST THIS MOVEMENT OF REBEL NATURE AS THEY TERMED IT
THE EMISSARIES OF RICHELIEU HAD FURNISHED FUEL TO THE FLAME OF REBELLION WHEN IT FIRST BROKE OUT IN SCOTLAND
AND THEY MENACED ALL THEIR OPPONENTS WITH THE SAME RIGID PERSECUTION UNDER WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD GROANED WHEN HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE HIERARCHY
FOR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE THESE MANY YEARS THE MILITARY BEING NOW IN APPEARANCE AS WELL AS IN REALITY THE SOLE POWER WHICH PREVAILED IN THE NATION CROMWELL THOUGH FIT TO INDULGE A NEW FANCY
THE CITY APPRENTICES ROSE IN A TUMULT AND DEMANDED A FREE PARLIAMENT
THE DANGER OF A CHANGE IN THE PEOPLE'S DISPOSITION AND OF GENERAL DISGUST CONTRACTED AGAINST POPULAR PRIVILEGES TO PREVENT SUCH AN EVIL NO EXPEDIENT IS MORE PROPER THAN TO CONTAIN OURSELVES WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF MODERATION AND TO CONSIDER THAT ALL EXTREMES NATURALLY AND INFALLIBLY BEGET EACH OTHER
THEY KNEW LAMBERT'S VIGOR AND ACTIVITY
ALL THE INSOLENCE WHICH SUCCESS CAN PRODUCE IN UNGENEROUS MINDS WAS EXERCISED BY THE COVENANTERS AGAINST MONTROSE WHOM THEY SO MUCH HATED AND SO MUCH DREADED

FOR IF HIS MAJESTY MAY BE PERSUADED TO TAKE WHAT HE WILL WHAT NEED WE GIVE
STAMFORD BEING ENCAMPED ON THE TOP OF A HIGH HILL NEAR STRATUM THEY ATTACKED HIM IN FOUR DIVISIONS AT FIVE IN THE MORNING HAVING LAIN ALL NIGHT UNDER ARMS
FAR FROM ALLOWING VIOLENCE HE WOULD NOT EVEN PERMIT INSULTS OR TRIUMPH OVER THE UNFORTUNATE ROYALISTS
NO PRIVATE MAN UNACQUAINTED WITH THE PLEASURES OF A COURT AND THE TUMULT OF A CAMP MORE PASSIONATELY LOVED HIS FAMILY THAN DID THIS GOOD PRINCE
THE PREVALENCE OF DEMOCRATICAL PRINCIPLES ENGAGED THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN TO BIND THEIR SONS APPRENTICES TO MERCHANTS AND COMMERCE HAS EVER SINCE BEEN MORE HONORABLE IN ENGLAND THAN IN ANY OTHER EUROPEAN KINGDOM
I CONFESS FOR IT BEHOVES ME TO DEAL PLAINLY WITH YOU I MUST CONFESS I WOULD SAY I HOPE I MAY BE UNDERSTOOD IN THIS
TO THIS PERIOD WAS EVERY MEASURE PRECIPITATED BY THE ZEALOUS INDEPENDENTS
BUT EXCEPT THIS CONTRACT WITH THE SCOTTISH NATION ALL THE OTHER MEASURES OF THE PARLIAMENT EITHER WERE HITHERTO ABSOLUTELY INSIGNIFICANT OR TENDED RATHER TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE PROTESTANT CAUSE IN IRELAND
SEE THE LIST IN FRANKLYN AND RUSHWORTH
THE GREAT POINT TO WHICH ALL MEN'S PROJECTS AT THIS TIME TENDED TWELVE NOBLEMEN PRESENTED A PETITION TO THE SAME PURPOSE BUT THE KING CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SUMMONING A GREAT COUNCIL OF THE PEERS AT YORK
AFTER LOSING MUCH TIME THE ENGLISH GENERAL SENT LAMBERT OVER THE FRITH INTO FIFE WITH AN INTENTION OF CUTTING OFF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ENEMY
THE RESPECT OF FOREIGN POWERS SOON FOLLOWED THE SUBMISSION OF THE KING'S SUBJECTS
EVEN THE ORDINARY RITES OF CIVILITY WERE SHUNNED AS THE NOURISHMENT OF CARNAL VANITY AND SELF-CONCEIT

JUXON ALONE WHOSE COURAGE WAS NOT INFERIOR TO HIS OTHER VIRTUES VENTURED TO ADVISE HIM IF IN HIS CONSCIENCE HE DID NOT APPROVE OF THE BILL BY NO MEANS TO ASSENT TO IT STRAFFORD HEARING OF CHARLES'S IRRESOLUTION AND ANXIETY TOOK A VERY EXTRAORDINARY STEP
THE STAR CHAMBER ALONE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PUNISH INFRACTIONS OF THE KING'S EDICTS
BUT WITH THE SAME SUCCESS AS BEFORE
AND GREAT HOPES OF SUCCESS WERE ENTERTAINED FROM THAT QUARTER
AND EXPRESSED GREAT ANXIETY THAT A SHIP WHICH HE SEEMED TO LOOK FOR HAD NOT ARRIVED
AND AFTER THE MURDER OF DORISLAUS THEY FOUND IT STILL MORE NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH BY REMOVING THE KING TO A DISTANCE FROM THEM
BUT IT ENRAGED THE PURITANICAL PARTY AND EXPOSED THE PRINCE TO THE ATTACKS OF ENEMIES NUMEROUS VIOLENT AND IMPLACABLE
THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND EVEN FLEETWOOD BROTHER-IN-LAW TO THE PROTECTOR WERE ENTERING INTO CABALS AGAINST HIM
IT WAS NATURAL FOR THE KING TO SEEK SOME RESOURCE WHILE ALL THE WORLD SEEMED TO DESERT HIM OR COMBINE AGAINST HIM
THE CLERGY WERE STILL RESOLUTE TO EXCLUDE ALL BUT THEIR MOST ZEALOUS ADHERENTS
THAT HE SPAKE NOT TO A MEMBER OF THE COURT NOR VOTED IN THE CAUSE BUT SAT UNCOVERED AS A PARTY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW TO LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FREEDOM
BUT AT LAST AFTER PASSING THROUGH MANY CROSS ROADS HE ARRIVED AT THE SCOTTISH CAMP BEFORE NEWARK THE PARLIAMENT HEARING OF HIS ESCAPE FROM OXFORD ISSUED RIGOROUS ORDERS AND THREATENED WITH INSTANT DEATH WHOEVER SHOULD HARBOR OR CONCEAL HIM THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING
AND THE PEOPLE SEEMED FOR THE TIME TO BE APPEASED AND SATISFIED
FURTHER ATTEMPTS WERE MADE BY THE PARLIAMENT WHILE IT SAT AND EVEN BY THE COMMONS ALONE FOR ASSUMING SOVEREIGN EXECUTIVE POWERS AND PUBLISHING THEIR ORDINANCES AS THEY CALLED THEM INSTEAD OF LAWS
AND EQUAL SHOUTS OF JOY ATTEND THEIR IGNOMINIOUS EXECUTION WITH THOSE WHICH SECOND THEIR PRESENT ADVANTAGES AND TRIUMPHS
AND EXPRESSED GREAT INCLINATION HAD THE LOW CONDITION OF SPAIN ALLOWED HIM TO GIVE ASSISTANCE TO THE DISTRESSED MONARCH
BEFORE HE ARRIVED AT THIS PLACE HE HAD GONE TO THE SEA-COAST
SEE L'ESPRIT DES LOIX LIV
HAD CROMWELL UNDERSTOOD AND REGARDED THE INTERESTS OF HIS COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THE DECLINING CONDITION OF SPAIN AGAINST THE DANGEROUS AMBITION OF FRANCE AND PRESERVED THAT BALANCE OF POWER ON WHICH THE GREATNESS AND SECURITY OF ENGLAND SO MUCH DEPEND
THE SOLE CRIME IMPUTED TO THE SECRETARY WAS HIS DELIVERING TO MONTROSE THE KING'S COMMISSION TO BE CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF SCOTLAND
TWO OTHERS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
THIS MAN SUITED TO THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED AND TO THAT ALONE WAS EQUALLY QUALIFIED TO GAIN THE AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE OF MEN BY WHAT WAS MEAN VULGAR AND RIDICULOUS IN HIS CHARACTER AS TO COMMAND THEIR OBEDIENCE BY WHAT WAS GREAT DARING AND ENTERPRISING
THE CLERGY NEVER COULD ESTEEM THE KING SUFFICIENTLY REGENERATED
BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF HIS SCOUTS LESLY AT PHILIPBAUGH IN THE FOREST SURPRISED HIS ARMY MUCH DIMINISHED IN NUMBERS FROM THE DESERTION OF THE HIGHLANDERS WHO HAD RETIRED TO THE HILLS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM IN ORDER TO SECURE THEIR PLUNDER
THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LEVIED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE PROJECTED IMPOSITIONS OR EXCISES THOUGH THE NUMBER SEEMS INSUFFICIENT FOR SUCH A PURPOSE THE HOUSE TOOK NOTICE OF THIS DESIGN IN SEVERE TERMS
AND WAS ENGAGED IN THE UNFORTUNATE EXPEDITIONS TO CADIZ AND THE ISLE OF RHE
THE PARLIAMENT WAS JUSTLY ALARMED
AND THEY APPLAUDED HIM FOR THIS LAST ACT OF VIOLENCE UPON THE PARLIAMENT
BUT NEVER WOULD GAIN THE PRESBYTERIANS WHO WERE AVERSE TO HIS FAMILY AND HIS CAUSE AND WOULD ASCRIBE HIS COMPLIANCE MERELY TO POLICY AND NECESSITY
SINCE IT AUGMENTED THE JEALOUSY WHICH PREVAILED AGAINST THE COURT AND ENGAGED HER TO PROCURE FOR THE CATHOLICS SOME INDULGENCES WHICH WERE GENERALLY DISTASTEFUL TO THE NATION IN THE FORMER SITUATION OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WHEN THE SOVEREIGN WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE INDEPENDENT OF HIS SUBJECTS THE KING CHOSE HIS MINISTERS EITHER FROM PERSONAL FAVOR OR FROM AN OPINION OF THEIR ABILITIES WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THEIR PARLIAMENTARY INTEREST OR TALENTS
PERHAPS HIS DIFFICULT SITUATION ADMITTED OF NEITHER
AND SOME ZEALOUS LEADERS AMONG THEM BEGAN TO RENEW THE DEMAND OF THOSE CONDITIONS WHICH HAD BEEN REQUIRED OF THE LATE KING IN THE TREATY OF NEWPORT
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THESE DISSENSIONS THE PARLIAMENT IT IS REMARKABLE HAD IN ALL THINGS ASSUMED AN EXTREME ASCENDANT OVER THEIR SOVEREIGN AND HAD DISPLAYED A VIOLENCE AND ARROGATED AN AUTHORITY WHICH ON HIS SIDE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPATIBLE EITHER WITH HIS TEMPER OR HIS SITUATION
CHARLES I 1640 THE CAUSES OF DISGUST WHICH FOR ABOVE THIRTY YEARS HAD DAILY BEEN MULTIPLYING IN ENGLAND WERE NOW COME TO FULL MATURITY AND THREATENED THE KINGDOM WITH SOME GREAT REVOLUTION OR CONVULSION
THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD IN VAIN DID STRAFFORD PLEAD IN HIS OWN DEFENCE AGAINST THIS ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT THAT THE SENTENCE OF MOUNTNORRIS WAS THE DEED AND THAT TOO UNANIMOUS OF THE COURT NOT THE ACT OF THE DEPUTY
HIS HOUSE WAS THE RESORT OF ALL THE ZEALOUS CLERGY OF THE PARTY
AFTER EVERY VICTORY HIS SOLDIERS GREEDY OF SPOIL BUT DEEMING THE SMALLEST ACQUISITION TO BE UNEXHAUSTED RICHES DESERTED IN GREAT NUMBERS AND WENT HOME TO SECURE THE TREASURES WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED
AND WHY NOT AT LEAST COMPOUND MATTERS WITH HIM WHEN BY ALL HIS LAWS IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD AGREED TO DEPART FROM IT
36
FROM ALL QUARTERS THE PARLIAMENT WAS HARASSED WITH PETITIONS OF A VERY FREE NATURE WHICH STRONGLY SPOKE THE SENSE OF THE NATION AND PROVED HOW ARDENTLY ALL MEN LONGED FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR LAWS AND LIBERTIES
THAT DEGREE OF LIBERTY WHICH IS NOW INDULGED TO CATHOLICS THOUGH A PARTY MUCH MORE OBNOXIOUS THAN DURING THE REIGN OF THE STUARTS IT SUITED NEITHER WITH CHARLES'S SENTIMENTS NOR THE HUMOR OF THE AGE TO ALLOW THEM
LORD FAIRFAX TOO HE HEARD HAD RAISED FORCES BEHIND HIM AND HAD POSSESSED HIMSELF OF YORK WITHOUT DECLARING HIS PURPOSE
A COUNCIL WAS APPOINTED WHICH WAS NOT TO EXCEED TWENTY-ONE NOR BE LESS THAN THIRTEEN PERSONS
AND THAT IN THE FIELDS OF DUNBAR AN IRREVOCABLE DECISION HAD BEEN AWARDED IN FAVOR OF THE ENGLISH ARMY SIR EDWARD WALKER
THE INTRODUCING OF SUPERSTITIOUS INNOVATIONS INTO THE CHURCH WITHOUT AUTHORITY OF LAW
945
AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMMITTEE WHICH AT THE FIRST MEETING OF PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO MADE NO PROGRESS IN THEIR WORK RECEIVED FRESH INJUNCTIONS TO FINISH THAT UNDERTAKING
THIS REASON IS SO SOLID AND CONVINCING THAT IT LEAVES NO ROOM TO DOUBT OF THE VERACITY OF PIERCY'S EVIDENCE
AND IN STORES THE VALUE OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS.[V SCOBEL P
HE HAD THE POWER OF PARDONING ALL CRIMES EXCEPTING MURDER AND TREASON
AND THE LICENTIOUS GORING GERRARD SIR RICHARD GRANVILLE NOW CARRIED IT TO A GREAT PITCH OF ENORMITY
AND BY RENDERING THEM ODIOUS TO THE COUNTRY SERVE AS A PRETENCE FOR DISBANDING THEM
BESIDES OTHER ARTICLES TO WHICH A COMPLETE VICTORY ALONE COULD ENTITLE THEM THEY REQUIRED THE KING IN EXPRESS TERMS UTTERLY TO ABOLISH EPISCOPACY
385 386
BY PRETEXT WHEREOF SOME OF YOUR MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN BY SOME OF THE SAID COMMISSIONERS PUT TO DEATH WHEN AND WHERE IF BY THE LAWS AND STATUTES OF THE LAND THEY HAD DESERVED DEATH BY THE SAME LAWS AND STATUTES ALSO THEY MIGHT AND BY NO OTHER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN JUDGED AND EXECUTED
WHILE HE SPOKE PERPETUALLY OF PARDONING ALL REBELS THEY TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE PUNISHMENT OF DELINQUENTS AND MALIGNANTS
AND HE NEVER FORGOT THE OBLIGATION
THE FORMER CONTRIBUTED SLOWLY
HE WENT FIRST TO SPAW THENCE HE RETIRED TO COLOGNE
AND EVERY OFFICE WAS INTRUSTED TO THE MOST IGNOBLE PART OF THE NATION
AND ENTERING EASILY AND AFFECTIONATELY INTO EVERY PART WHICH HE WAS DISPOSED TO ACT HE WAS ENABLED EVEN AFTER MULTIPLIED DECEITS TO COVER UNDER A TEMPEST OF PASSION ALL HIS CROOKED SCHEMES AND PROFOUND ARTIFICES
A FRESH INSTANCE OF HYPOCRISY WAS DISPLAYED THE VERY DAY OF THE KING'S DEATH
OF A SWEET BUT MELANCHOLY ASPECT
OF ALL THE DEMANDS OF THE PARLIAMENT CHARLES REFUSED ONLY TWO
THE AFFABILITY OF HIS BEHAVIOR THE GAYETY OF HIS MANNERS THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS EXPENSE INCREASED STILL FURTHER THE GENERAL ADMIRATION WHICH WAS PAID HIM
BESIDES PRIVATE ADVENTURERS WITHOUT NUMBER THE KING AND PARLIAMENT THEMSELVES CARRIED ON THE CONTROVERSY BY MESSAGES REMONSTRANCES AND DECLARATIONS
MOST HISTORIANS HAVE THOUGHT THAT CROMWELL NEVER WAS SINCERE IN HIS PROFESSIONS

WHEN THE DEBATES HAD BEEN CARRIED ON TO NO PURPOSE DURING TWENTY DAYS AMONG THE COMMISSIONERS THEY SEPARATED AND RETURNED

THE FINER ARTS TOO HE HAD IN HIS YOUTH SUCCESSFULLY CULTIVATED
WOULD HE PRESENTLY HAVE ADOPTED A MEASURE WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY SO HURTFUL TO HIS AUTHORITY
THE SUBJECT OF PYM'S HARANGUE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED ABOVE
THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND AND FOUR MEMBERS OF THE LOWER HOUSE CAME TO OXFORD AS COMMISSIONERS IN THIS TREATY THE KING PERPETUALLY INSISTED ON THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE CROWN IN ITS LEGAL POWERS AND ON THE RESTORATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL PREROGATIVE THE PARLIAMENT STILL REQUIRED NEW CONCESSIONS AND A FURTHER ABRIDGMENT OF REGAL AUTHORITY AS A MORE EFFECTUAL REMEDY TO THEIR FEARS AND JEALOUSIES
AND BEING AT A DISTANCE HE HAD SENT THE KEYS OF HIS CABINET AS WAS PRETENDED TO HIS SON SIR HENRY IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR SOME PAPERS WHICH WERE NECESSARY FOR COMPLETING A MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT
MOST OF THEM WERE CARRIED HEADLONG BY FANATICISM
THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES ELATED BY PAST VICTORIES GOVERNED BY THE MOST RIGID DISCIPLINE MET WITH NO EQUAL OPPOSITION FROM TROOPS DISMAYED BY REPEATED DEFEATS AND CORRUPTED BY LICENTIOUS MANNERS
THEY DEMANDED THAT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAY OR INQUIRY REPARATION SHOULD BE MADE FOR ALL THE DAMAGES WHICH THE ENGLISH HAD SUSTAINED
530 533
297 THE LOSS SUSTAINED BY THE ROYALISTS IN THE ASSAULT OF BRISTOL WAS CONSIDERABLE
THE RIGHT OF PEACE WAR AND ALLIANCE RESTED IN HIM BUT IN THESE PARTICULARS HE WAS TO ACT BY THE ADVICE AND WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS COUNCIL
AND HAVING EXPERIENCED THE ILL EFFECTS OF FORMER OBSTINACY THEY WOULD PROBABLY ASSEMBLE WITH A RESOLUTION OF MAKING SOME REASONABLE COMPLIANCES
YET HAD THE TWO ARMIES MARCHED TEN DAYS IN THIS MUTUAL IGNORANCE
AND THE SCOTS FOUND THAT IN PROPORTION AS THEIR ASSISTANCE BECAME LESS NECESSARY LESS VALUE WAS PUT UPON THEM
OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS SHUT UP IN THE CITY FOUR THOUSAND ALONE SURVIVED THE FATIGUES AND FAMINE WHICH THEY HAD UNDERGONE RUSHWORTH VOL
FLUXES AND CONTAGIOUS DISTEMPERS CREPT IN AMONG THE SOLDIERS WHO PERISHED IN GREAT NUMBERS
THE EARL OF ARGYLE WAS CREATED A MARQUIS LORD LOUDON AN EARL LESLEY WAS DIGNIFIED WITH THE TITLE OF EARL OF LEVEN HIS FRIENDS HE WAS OBLIGED FOR THE PRESENT TO NEGLECT AND OVERLOOK
OTHERS HAVING NOW LEISURE TO REFLECT ON THEIR MIGHTY LOSS OF FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CURSED THAT BEING WHICH THEY HAD SAVED

AND LIKE VAPORS RISING OUT OF THE EARTH AND GATHERED INTO A CLOUD HAD FALLEN IN SWEET AND REFRESHING SHOWERS ON THE SAME FIELDS FROM WHICH THEY HAD AT FIRST BEEN EXHALED

HOW MUCH GREATER DIFFICULTY SHOULD HE FIND AT PRESENT TO SUBDUE BY VIOLENCE A PEOPLE INFLAMED WITH RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES
THEY CARRIED THEIR RIGID AUSTERITY SO FAR AS TO ENACT A LAW DECLARING FORNICATION AFTER THE FIRST ACT TO BE FELONY WITHOUT BENEFIT OF CLERGY THEY MADE SMALL PROGRESS IN THAT IMPORTANT WORK WHICH THEY PROFESSED TO HAVE SO MUCH AT HEART THE SETTLING OF A NEW MODEL OF REPRESENTATION AND A BILL WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE AGAINST PAINTING PATCHES AND OTHER IMMODEST DRESS OF WOMEN
ALL THESE SUCCESSES OF THE ENGLISH WERE CHIEFLY OWING TO THE SUPERIOR SIZE OF THEIR VESSELS
AND WHILE THE KING'S OFFICERS INDULGED THEMSELVES EVEN IN GREATER LICENSES THAN THOSE TO WHICH DURING TIMES OF PEACE THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED THEY WERE APT BOTH TO NEGLECT THEIR MILITARY DUTY AND TO SET A PERNICIOUS EXAMPLE OF DISORDER TO THE SOLDIERS UNDER THEIR COMMAND
EVERY TOWN BEFORE WHICH CROMWELL PRESENTED HIMSELF NOW OPENED ITS GATES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
THE FERVOR OF HIS SPIRIT FREQUENTLY PROMPTED HIM TO RISE IN THE HOUSE
THE HOSTILITIES WITH SPAIN IN WHICH THE KING ON HIS ACCESSION FOUND HIMSELF ENGAGED HOWEVER IMPRUDENT AND UNNECESSARY HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE ADVICE AND EVEN IMPORTUNITY OF THE PARLIAMENT
THE RAGE OF THE PEOPLE WAS ON ACCOUNT OF HER RELIGION AS WELL AS HER SPIRIT AND ACTIVITY UNIVERSALLY LEVELLED AGAINST HER
HIS IMPEACHMENT THEREFORE WAS PUSHED ON WITH THE UTMOST VIGOR
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND AND HER SON CHARLES DURING THESE COMMOTIONS PASSED MOST OF THEIR TIME AT PARIS
WHAT CODE ASCERTAINED THE PRECISE AUTHORITY OF THE ROMAN SENATE IN EVERY OCCURRENCE
BUT THE SENTENCE WAS REMITTED BY THE GENERAL RUSH
THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON
IN ORDER TO PREVENT HIM WALLER PRESENTLY DISLODGED AND HASTENED BY QUICK MARCHES TO THAT TOWN WHILE THE KING SUDDENLY RETURNING UPON HIS OWN FOOTSTEPS REACHED OXFORD
EVEN THOSE AMONG THE REPUBLICANS WHO ADOPTED NOT SUCH EXTRAVAGANCIES WERE SO INTOXICATED WITH THEIR SAINTLY CHARACTER THAT THEY SUPPOSED THEMSELVES POSSESSED OF PECULIAR PRIVILEGES
ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE ENGLISH MERCHANTS TO AN IMMENSE VALUE WERE CONFISCATED IN SPAIN
AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE
HIS SILENCE IN THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS ENTERPRISE OUGHT TO BE NO OBJECTION TO HIS SINCERITY

THEY ALLOWED OF APPEALS TO PARLIAMENT FROM ALL ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS
BUT BOTH OF THEM PREPARED FOR AN EVENT WHICH THEY DEEMED INEVITABLE
IN VAIN DID CHARLES EXPECT AS A RETURN FOR SO MANY INSTANCES OF UNBOUNDED COMPLIANCE THAT THE PARLIAMENT WOULD AT LAST SHOW HIM SOME INDULGENCE AND WOULD CORDIALLY FALL INTO THAT UNANIMITY TO WHICH AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS OWN POWER AND OF HIS FRIEND'S LIFE HE SO EARNESTLY COURTED THEM

HIS ENEMIES FORM SUCH A REPRESENTATION OF HIS MORAL QUALITIES AS RESEMBLES THE MOST VIRULENT INVECTIVE

LORD FAIRFAX SIR WILLIAM WALLER AND MANY HEADS OF THE PRESBYTERIANS HAD SECRETLY ENTERED INTO THE ENGAGEMENT
NOTHING COULD BE MORE EASY IN THE EXECUTION THAN THIS MEASURE NOR MORE AGREEABLE TO HIS OWN AND TO NATIONAL INTEREST
AND SHOULD BE HAPPY IF IN HIS FUTURE DESTINY HE COULD FOLLOW HIM TO THE SAME BLISSFUL MANSIONS WHERE HIS PIETY AND HUMANE VIRTUES HAD ALREADY WITHOUT DOUBT SECURED HIM AN ETERNAL RECOMPENSE
HE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE OF THEIR TREACHERY MADE HIS RETREAT WITH CELERITY AND CONDUCT AND SHELTERED HIS SMALL ARMY IN DUBLIN AND THE OTHER FORTIFIED TOWNS WHICH STILL REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE PROTESTANTS
84

AND BEING GENEROUSLY DETERMINED TO REMEMBER ANCIENT FAVORS MORE THAN RECENT INJURIES HE IMMEDIATELY EMBRACED WITH ZEAL AND SUCCESS THE PROTECTION OF THE ROYAL CAUSE
AND MANY IRISH OFFICERS WHO SERVED IN THE SPANISH TROOPS HAD ENGAGED TO JOIN THEM AS SOON AS THEY SAW AN INSURRECTION ENTERED UPON BY THEIR CATHOLIC BRETHREN
722
RUPERT TOOK SHELTER IN KINSALE
AND THUS WAS DISSIPATED OR RENDERED USELESS THAT BODY OF FORCES WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM IRELAND
FAIRFAX AND SKIPPON ENCOUNTERED HIM AND WELL SUPPORTED THAT REPUTATION WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED
AND HAVING THUS RENDERED THEM ACCOMPLICES IN GUILT GAVE THEM THAT DEATH WHICH THEY SOUGHT TO SHUN BY DESERVING IT AMIDST ALL THESE ENORMITIES THE SACRED NAME OF RELIGION RESOUNDED ON EVERY SIDE
THE VERY SABBATH THEY PROFANED
HE REPRESENTED THAT HAVING BEEN ENGAGED IN TREATY WITH HIS TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND HAVING FINISHED ALMOST EVERY ARTICLE HE HAD EXPECTED TO BE BROUGHT TO HIS CAPITAL IN ANOTHER MANNER AND ERE THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO HIS POWER DIGNITY REVENUE AS WELL AS TO HIS PERSONAL LIBERTY
THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS
AND THEY ADHERED TO THAT MAXIM WHICH IS IN THE MAIN PRUDENT AND POLITICAL THAT WHOEVER DRAWS THE SWORD AGAINST HIS SOVEREIGN SHOULD THROW AWAY THE SCABBARD
THIS PRINCE WAS OF A COMELY PRESENCE
FROM THIS DISTINCTION AS FROM A FIRST PRINCIPLE WERE DERIVED BY A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE ALL THE OTHER DIFFERENCES OF THESE TWO SECTS

COMPETENT SALARIES HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE IMPOVERISHED CLERGY FROM THE TITHES OF EACH PARISH
BUT SEIDEN APPREHENSIVE OF THE LOSS ENGAGED HIS FRIEND WHITLOCKE THEN LORD-KEEPER FOR THE COMMONWEALTH TO APPLY FOR THE OFFICE OF LIBRARIAN
AND THERE YOU SHALL FIND TO YOUR GREAT JOY THE PRIZE TO WHICH YOU HASTEN A CROWN OF GLORY I GO REPLIED THE KING FROM A CORRUPTIBLE TO AN INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN
FAINT NOT HEWIT OF HEATHFIELD
IT IS HOWEVER REMARKABLE THAT THE GREATEST GENIUS BY FAR THAT SHONE OUT IN ENGLAND DURING THIS PERIOD WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED WITH THESE FANATICS AND EVEN PROSTITUTED HIS PEN IN THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSY IN FACTIOUS DISPUTES AND IN JUSTIFYING THE MOST VIOLENT MEASURES OF THE PARTY
AND THAT HIS MOTIVES WOULD APPEAR IF HIS HAT WERE FOUND

NO PLUNDER NO CONQUESTS COULD BE HOPED FOR
WHEN GRATIFIED IN THIS PRETENSION THEY IMMEDIATELY DISPERSED AND LEFT THE PARLIAMENT AT LIBERTY RUSH

AND GREAT MULTITUDES RESORTED TO EDINBURGH IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THE INTRODUCTION OF SO HATED A NOVELTY KING'S DECL
THE OTHER IRISH DIVIDED BETWEEN THEIR CLERGY WHO WERE AVERSE TO ORMOND AND THEIR NOBILITY WHO WERE ATTACHED TO HIM WERE VERY UNCERTAIN IN THEIR MOTIONS AND FEEBLE IN THEIR MEASURES
COLONEL SANDYS WHO LED THEM AND WHO FOUGHT WITH VALOR BEING MORTALLY WOUNDED FELL FROM HIS HORSE
AND ENLISTING THESE TROOPS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AT CHARLES'S EXPENSE HE LANDED THEM IN THE ELBE

FOR I AM SURE THAT ONCE I WAS IN A STATE OF GRACE HIS PHYSICIANS WERE SENSIBLE OF THE PERILOUS CONDITION TO WHICH HIS DISTEMPER HAD REDUCED HIM
THE STAR CHAMBER ALSO WAS A COURT WHICH EXERTED HIGH DISCRETIONARY POWERS AND HAD NO PRECISE RULE OR LIMIT EITHER WITH REGARD TO THE CAUSES WHICH CAME UNDER ITS JURISDICTION OR THE DECISIONS WHICH IT FORMED
THOUGH THE ENGLISH NATION BE NATURALLY CANDID AND SINCERE HYPOCRISY PREVAILED AMONG THEM BEYOND ANY EXAMPLE IN ANCIENT OR MODERN TIMES
BY HIS PERSUASION WAS FRAMED AT EDINBURGH THAT SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT WHICH EFFACED ALL FORMER PROTESTATIONS AND VOWS TAKEN IN BOTH KINGDOMS AND LONG MAINTAINED ITS CREDIT AND AUTHORITY
LANSDOWNE CLARENDON
NOTHING MORE HAPPY CAN BE IMAGINED THAN THE SITUATION IN WHICH ENGLAND THEN STOOD WITH REGARD TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS
THE IMPORT OF THIS PETITION WAS THAT FLEETWOOD SHOULD BE MADE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LAMBERT MAJOR-GENERAL DESBOROW LIEUTENANT-GENERAL OF THE HORSE MONK MAJOR-GENERAL OF THE FOOT
THEOLOGICAL ANTIPATHY FURTHER INCREASED THEIR INDIGNITIES TOWARDS A PERSON WHOM THEY REGARDED AS IMPIOUS ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXCOMMUNICATION WHICH HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AGAINST HIM
LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND TO A MAN LIKE CECIL WHOM THOUGH HE POSSESSED GREAT EXPERIENCE THE PEOPLE JUDGING BY THE EVENT ESTEEMED OF SLENDER CAPACITY 1626 CHARLES HAVING FAILED OF SO RICH A PRIZE WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT
AND SAID THAT HE BORE THIS TESTIMONY OF HIS BRAVERY AND LOYALTY WITH MORE PRIDE THAN HE HAD EVER WORN THE GARTER
THEY HAD CONFINED HIS PERSON
THE TWO REPUBLICS WERE NOT INFLAMED BY ANY NATIONAL ANTIPATHY AND THEIR INTERESTS VERY LITTLE INTERFERED
DE RUITER NEXT DAY SAILED OFF WITH HIS CONVOY
THE TREATY OF MARRIAGE THE REGARD TO THE QUEEN'S SEX AND HIGH STATION EVEN COMMON HUMANITY
THAT IF HE NOW SEEMED TO DESIRE SOMETHING FURTHER HE ALSO MADE THEM IN RETURN A CONSIDERABLE OFFER AND WAS WILLING FOR THE FUTURE TO DEPEND ON THEM FOR A REVENUE WHICH WAS QUITE NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC HONOR AND SECURITY
YOUR TROOPS SAID HE TO HAMBDEN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT ARE MOST OF THEM OLD DECAYED SERVING MEN AND TAPSTERS AND SUCH KIND OF FELLOWS
NO AGE OR NATION AMONG THE MODERNS HAD EVER SET AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH AN INDULGENCE
THE PROTECTOR REAPED LITTLE SATISFACTION FROM THE SUCCESS OF HIS ARMS ABROAD
BUT NEITHER THE PRESENCE OF HIS ARMY NOR THE PRECARIOUS HOPES OF A TREATY RETARDED THE KING'S APPROACHES
THE LORD PITY YOU
AND IF THAT WERE REFUSED WE MUST HAVE RECOURSE THEY SAID TO THAT FIRST AND PRIMARY LAW WITH WHICH GOD HAS ENDOWED ALL MEN
147
DURING THE INTERVALS OF ACTION THEY OCCUPIED THEMSELVES IN SERMONS PRAYERS EXHORTATIONS
AND TO REDRESS THESE GRIEVANCES A PARLIAMENT WAS IMPATIENTLY LONGED FOR
THE FOLLOWING INTERVAL BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD PARLIAMENT WAS DISTINGUISHED BY SO MANY EXERTIONS OF PREROGATIVE THAT MEN HAD LITTLE LEISURE TO ATTEND TO THE AFFAIR OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WHERE THE ABUSE OF POWER IN THE CROWN MIGHT SEEM TO BE OF A MORE DISPUTABLE NATURE
CALL TOGETHER PARLIAMENTS WITH A WORD OF HIS PEN AND SCATTER THEM AGAIN WITH THE BREATH OF HIS MOUTH
THE COMMISSIONERS THEREFORE NOT BEING ABLE TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THEIR DEMANDS DESIRED THE KING'S PASSPORT FOR LONDON WHERE THEY PURPOSED TO CONFER WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND BEING LIKEWISE DENIED THIS REQUEST THEY RETURNED WITH EXTREME DISSATISFACTION TO EDINBURGH
THAT NO MAN LIVING HAD CREDIT ENOUGH WITH HIM TO HAVE DISPOSED HIM TO SUCH AN ACTION
AND COULD THEY EVEN BE BROUGHT TO MAKE SUCH AN ATTEMPT IT HAD SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED BY THE EVENT OF HAMILTON'S ENGAGEMENT HOW UNEQUAL THEIR FORCE WAS TO SO GREAT AN ENTERPRISE
AS THAT THAT IS A TENDER OF MY HUMBLE REASONS AND JUDGMENT AND OPINION TO THEM
THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE PROTESTERS
AND THE TROOPS ANIMATED BY THEIR VALOR AND GUIDED BY THEIR DISCIPLINE ACQUIRED EVERY DAY A GREATER ASCENDANT OVER THE SPANIARDS
ANOTHER PARTY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE LAW AND ITS PROFESSORS
HE EXPECTED THAT THE MIGHTY ZEAL EXPRESSED BY THE SCOTS FOR THE PROTESTANT RELIGION WOULD IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE THEM TO FLY TO ITS DEFENCE WHERE IT WAS SO VIOLENTLY INVADED
THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM
CHARLES NOW ENJOYED HIMSELF IN THE FULL EXERCISE OF HIS AUTHORITY IN A SOCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FRIENDS AND COURTIERS AND IN A MODERATE USE OF THOSE PLEASURES WHICH HE MOST AFFECTED
THE PROTECTOR DREADING COMBINATIONS BETWEEN THE PARLIAMENT AND THE MALECONTENTS IN THE ARMY RESOLVED TO ALLOW NO LEISURE FOR FORMING ANY CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
AND EVEN AT HIS OWN FATAL END THE MEMORY OF THIS GUILT WITH GREAT SORROW AND REMORSE RECURRED UPON HIM
THE GRANVILLES HIS NEAR RELATIONS AND ALL THE REST OF HIS KINDRED WERE IN THE SAME INTERESTS
16TH NOV
AND HE LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN THAT PALACE WITH AN APPEARANCE OF DIGNITY AND FREEDOM
TO CIRCUMSCRIBE THIS POWER IS TO DESTROY ITS NATURE
HE ACCEPTED OF A PENSION OF EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FROM THEM AND TOOK A PLACE IN THEIR ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES
THAT HE SHOULD RATIFY ALL ACTS OF PARLIAMENT BY WHICH PRESBYTERIAN GOVERNMENT THE DIRECTORY OF WORSHIP THE CONFESSION OF FAITH AND THE CATECHISM WERE ESTABLISHED
P 381
THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRESBYTERIANS LED THEM TO REJECT THE AUTHORITY OF PRELATES TO THROW OFF THE RESTRAINT OF LITURGIES TO RETRENCH CEREMONIES TO LIMIT THE RICHES AND AUTHORITY OF THE PRIESTLY OFFICE
IN EVERY STEP WAS EXPOSED TO IMMINENT PERILS AND RECEIVED DAILY PROOFS OF UNCORRUPTED FIDELITY AND ATTACHMENT
A QUICK CONCEPTION A CULTIVATED UNDERSTANDING A CHASTE CONCLUSION A DIGNIFIED MANNER
AND HE CONFESSED WHATEVER HE KNEW WITHOUT SPARING HIS MOST INTIMATE FRIENDS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM WITHOUT DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE NEGLIGENCE OF FAMILIAR CONVERSATION AND THE SCHEMES OF A REGULAR CONSPIRACY
IF ANY OF HIS FRIENDS EXHORTED HIM TO MORE VIGOR THEY COULD GET NO OTHER ANSWER THAN THAT GOD HAD SPITTEN IN HIS FACE AND WOULD NOT HEAR HIM
THE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS HAD PASSED WITHOUT THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF VIOLENCE AS DID INDEED ALL THE BILLS PASSED DURING THE FIRST YEAR EXCEPT STRAFFORD'S ATTAINDER WHICH COULD NOT BE RECALLED
THE MORE EFFECTUALLY TO CURB THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND SEDITIOUS SPIRIT OF THE TROOPS CROMWELL ESTABLISHED A KIND OF MILITIA IN THE SEVERAL COUNTIES
TO THE ARMY REPLIED JOYCE
THEIR DELIVERY OF THE KING AND THE ESTIMATION OF THEIR ARREARS
ON THE CONTRARY A NEW ORDER IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE
SHE WAS A DECENT WOMAN
AND GRUNT OUT A BASS AS IT WERE A NUMBER OF HOGS
THE DUTCH WAR BEING SUCCESSFUL AND THE PEACE REASONABLE BROUGHT CREDIT TO CROMWELL'S ADMINISTRATION
AS SOON AS MONK DECLARED AGAINST THE ENGLISH ARMY HE DESPATCHED EMISSARIES INTO IRELAND AND ENGAGED THE OFFICERS IN THAT KINGDOM TO CONCUR WITH HIM IN THE SAME MEASURES
AND ON THE PEDESTAL THESE WORDS WERE INSCRIBED
THE TESTIMONIES WHICH PROVE THAT PERFORMANCE TO BE THE KING'S ARE MORE NUMEROUS CERTAIN AND DIRECT THAN THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND SUCH OF THE INFANTRY AS STOOD NEXT THEM WERE LIKEWISE BORNE DOWN AND PUT TO FLIGHT
AND THE COURT WHICH GOVERNED THIS DIVISION WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE MINISTERS TOGETHER WITH TWO THREE OR FOUR ELDERS CHOSEN FROM EACH PARISH
PACKET AND SOME OTHER OFFICERS WHOM CROMWELL SUSPECTED WERE ALSO DISPLACED
THIS DELICACY SO UNUSUAL TO THE PLACE AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN WAS REMARKED BY THE KING
THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DISHONORABLE THAN THAT THE KING IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SHOULD SACRIFICE MERELY FOR THE EMPTY NAME OF ROYALTY THOSE PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH HIS FATHER HAD DIED A MARTYR AND IN WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN STRICTLY EDUCATED
AND THEY DECLARED IT HIGH TREASON TO LEVY ANY MONEY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
SIR PHILIP MUSGRAVE WITH SOME SCOTS BEING ENGAGED AT DUMFRIES IN A LIKE ENTERPRISE MET WITH A LIKE FATE
AND IN THE HOPES ALONE OF HIS SUBMITTING TO A LEGAL AND LIMITED GOVERNMENT WERE THEY WILLING IN HIS DEFENCE TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES
SERVE ALL PARTIES PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE AND COMMAND THEM VICTORIOUSLY AT LAST
ORDERS WERE GIVEN BY THE COMMONS ALONE WITHOUT OTHER AUTHORITY THAT IT SHOULD BE SUBSCRIBED BY THE WHOLE NATION
AND THIS CAUTIOUS POLITICIAN FINDING HIM NOW A PERSON WHOSE SECRECY COULD BE SAFELY TRUSTED ADMITTED HIM TO HIS PRESENCE AND OPENED TO HIM HIS WHOLE INTENTIONS
CHARLES I

DESIGNS WERE EVEN ENTERTAINED OF TRANSPORTING THE LOYAL FAMILIES TO BARBADOES JAMAICA AND THE OTHER COLONIES LEST THEY SHOULD PROPAGATE IN ENGLAND CHILDREN OF THE SAME MALIGNANT AFFECTIONS WITH THEMSELVES
AND HIS JUSTICE WAS ONLY A BARBAROUS POLICY IN ORDER TO TERRIFY ALL OTHER GARRISONS FROM RESISTANCE
FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
HE BECKONED HARRISON AND TOLD HIM THAT HE NOW JUDGED THE PARLIAMENT RIPE FOR A DISSOLUTION
IN ORDER TO JUDGE OF THE MAXIMS BY WHICH HE CONDUCTED HIS FOREIGN POLITICS SEE FURTHER THURLOE VOL
AND IS THEREFORE TIME FOR US TO RETURN THITHER AND TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THAT KINGDOM
THE LATTER WAS BY CROMWELL SENT BEYOND SEA
WHEN THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A BODY THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT STILL ROSE TO A HIGHER PITCH
AND WAS THE CHIEF STEP WHICH THIS AMBITIOUS POLITICIAN HAD YET MADE TOWARDS SOVEREIGN POWER
HE RETURNED FROM NO PLACE BY THE DIRECT ROAD OR BY THE SAME WAY WHICH HE WENT

BUT I DOUBT IF THERE WERE SO GOOD A ONE
IT BEHOVED THEREFORE THE ZEALOUS INNOVATORS IN PARLIAMENT TO PROCEED WITH SOME CAUTION AND RESERVE
WHEN CARRIED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE THEY REFUSED HIM ALL REVERENCE AND TREATED HIM WITH THE SAME FAMILIARITY AS IF HE HAD BEEN THEIR EQUAL
AND IF HE WERE EVER SO UNSUCCESSFUL NOTHING WORSE COULD BEFALL HIM THAN WHAT FROM HIS INACTIVITY HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE EXPOSED TO TO SHOW HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO EXECUTE THIS PROJECT HE ORDERED AN ASSAULT TO BE MADE ON SOME QUARTERS OF THE SCOTS AND HE GAINED AN ADVANTAGE OVER THEM
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES AMOUNTING TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS A SUBSIDY WAS NOW FALLEN TO ABOUT FIFTY-SIX THOUSAND POUNDS CABALA P
AND HAD PROVIDED BY AN EXPRESS LAW OF HENRY VII FOR THE SECURITY OF THOSE WHO ACT IN DEFENCE OF THE KING IN BEING BY WHATEVER MEANS HE MIGHT HAVE ACQUIRED POSSESSION
RECKON IT SO MORE THAN TO EAT SLEEP AND COUNSEL TOGETHER
AND WITHOUT ABATING ANY THING OF THEIR RIGOR ON THIS HEAD THEY PROCEEDED TO THEIR DEMANDS WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WAS NOW ASSEMBLED AND DISCOVERED IN EVERY VOTE THE SAME DISPOSITIONS IN WHICH THEY HAD SEPARATED
AND EACH ARMY OCCUPIED THE GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY THE ENEMY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY
AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
BY THESE MULTIPLIED SUCCESSES OF THE ARMY THEY HAD SUBDUED ALL THEIR ENEMIES
AND THAT IN ALL APPEARANCES BEFORE HIS JUDGES HE NEVER FORGOT HIS PART EITHER AS A PRINCE OR AS A MAN
AND NOTHING COULD ESCAPE HIS VIGILANT INQUIRY
ESSEX HIMSELF SHOWED EXTREME DISSATISFACTION AND EXHORTED THE PARLIAMENT TO MAKE PEACE.[V RUSH
IN HOPES OF OBTAINING GREATER INFLUENCE IN ELECTIONS THE ANCIENT RIGHT WAS RESTORED TO ALL THE SMALL BOROUGHS
THE OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE TAKEN PRISONERS WITH THE MARQUIS WALKING TWO AND TWO BEFORE THEM
CROMWELL THOUGH HIMSELF A BARBARIAN WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO LITERARY MERIT
THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS WOULD ALLOW NONE OF HIS COUNCIL TO BE PRESENT AND REFUSED TO ENTER INTO REASONING WITH ANY BUT HIMSELF
AND BOTH FRIENDS AND ENEMIES CONCURRED IMMEDIATELY TO VOTE HIM INTO THAT IMPORTANT OFFICE
WHERE CELERITY WAS NECESSARY HE FLEW TO A DECISION
IN THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT THERE REMAINED SOME MEMBERS WHO THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN INDUCED EITHER BY PRIVATE AMBITION OR BY ZEAL FOR CIVIL LIBERTY TO CONCUR WITH THE MAJORITY STILL RETAINED AN ATTACHMENT TO THE HIERARCHY AND TO THE ANCIENT MODES OF WORSHIP
NO HOPES REMAINED AFTER HIS VIOLENT BREACH WITH THE LAST PARLIAMENT THAT HE SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH WITH GENERAL CONSENT A LEGAL SETTLEMENT OR TEMPER THE MILITARY WITH ANY MIXTURE OF CIVIL AUTHORITY
BUT AS THESE POINTS COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED BE CLEAR DURING THE TIME AS THEY ARE OR MAY BE AT PRESENT THERE ARE GREAT REASONS OF ALLEVIATION FOR MEN WHO WERE HEATED BY THE CONTROVERSY OR ENGAGED IN THE ACTION
AND ON PRETENCE OF THESE AND OF ERECTING NEW COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS WAS THIS GRIEVANCE NOW RENEWED

THE WOMEN APPLIED BY PETITION FOR HIS RELEASE
AND THAT THAT HOUSE WAS USELESS AND DANGEROUS AND WAS THEREFORE TO BE ABOLISHED
ALL THOSE GOOD QUALITIES WHICH HE POSSESSED HIS AFFABILITY HIS WIT HIS GAYETY HIS GENTLEMAN-LIKE DISENGAGED BEHAVIOR WERE HERE SO MANY VICES
FROM POLICY AT FIRST AND INCLINATION NOW FROM NECESSITY THE KING ATTACHED HIMSELF EXTREMELY TO THE HIERARCHY
THE INDIGNATION ENTERTAINED BY THE PEOPLE AGAINST AN AUTHORITY FOUNDED ON SUCH MANIFEST USURPATION WAS NOT SO VIOLENT AS MIGHT NATURALLY BE EXPECTED
LOVE GIBBONS AND OTHER PRESBYTERIANS HAVING ENTERED INTO A PLOT AGAINST THE REPUBLIC WERE ALSO TRIED CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THEREFORE A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED TO BRING IN A CHARGE AGAINST THE KING
MONTAGUE WHO HAD BEEN CENSURED FOR MODERATION TOWARDS THE CATHOLICS THE GREATEST OF CRIMES HAD BEEN CREATED BISHOP OF CHICHESTER
HE WAS REPULSED ROUTED AND PURSUED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS STUNNED AND DISHEARTENED WITH THIS BLOW HIS ARMY DECAYED AND MELTED AWAY BY DESERTION

THE TABLE OF GENTRY WAS DIVIDED INTO MANY SUBORDINATE TABLES ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT COUNTIES
THE LATTER AFFECTION HOWEVER PREVAILED FOR THE TIME AND MADE HIM HASTEN THOSE MILITARY PREPARATIONS WHICH HE HAD PROJECTED FOR SUBDUING THE REFRACTORY SPIRIT OF THE SCOTTISH NATION
421 423 430 467
INTEREST IN 1650 WAS REDUCED TO SIX PER CENT
FIRM AND INTREPID HE MAINTAINED IN EACH REPLY THE UTMOST PERSPICUITY AND JUSTNESS BOTH OF THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION
NO WONDER THEREFORE HE WAS IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
THESE COMMISSIONERS HE EMPOWERED AT THE SAME TIME TO GIVE HIS ASSENT TO THE BILL WHICH RENDERED THE PARLIAMENT PERPETUAL
PYM IN A LONG STUDIED DISCOURSE DIVIDED INTO MANY HEADS AFTER HIS MANNER ENUMERATED ALL THE GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH THE NATION LABORED
AND THIS ORDER SO CAREFULLY OBSERVED BY THEIR ANCESTORS WAS FOUNDED ON A JEALOUSY INHERENT IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WAS NEVER INTERPRETED AS ANY PECULIAR DIFFIDENCE OF THE PRESENT SOVEREIGN
AND HE TREATED THEM ENTIRELY AS CONQUERED PROVINCES
353 JOURN
THE LOW COUNTRIES WERE INVADED WITH SUPERIOR FORCES AND SEEMED READY TO CHANGE THEIR MASTER
DESBOROW A MAN OF A CLOWNISH AND BRUTAL NATURE THREATENED HIM IF HE SHOULD REFUSE COMPLIANCE
THE PARLIAMENT HOPED THAT THE ROYALISTS SENSIBLE OF THEIR FEEBLE CONDITION AND CONVINCED OF THEIR SLENDER RESOURCES WOULD DISPERSE OF THEMSELVES AND LEAVE THEIR ADVERSARIES A VICTORY SO MUCH THE MORE COMPLETE AND SECURE AS IT WOULD BE GAINED WITHOUT THE APPEARANCE OF FORCE AND WITHOUT BLOODSHED
THE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAD AT FIRST TAKEN SHELTER AND CONCEALED THEMSELVES UNDER THE WINGS OF THE PRESBYTERIANS NOW EVIDENTLY APPEARED A DISTINCT PARTY AND BETRAYED VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND PRETENSIONS
FRANCE MADE PROTESTATIONS OF AFFECTION AND REGARD AND OFFERED CALAIS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
SUCH ENORMITIES THOUGH ATTESTED BY UNDOUBTED EVIDENCE APPEAR ALMOST INCREDIBLE
50 RUSH
AND ALL THE PEERS EXCEPT LORD SAY WERE ESTEEMED OF THAT PARTY
HE SENT THE MARQUIS OF HAMILTON AS COMMISSIONER WITH AUTHORITY TO TREAT WITH THE COVENANTERS
INVASIONS AND INSURRECTIONS TALKED OF

HE RODE BEFORE A PORTMANTEAU AND CALLED HIMSELF ASHBURNHAM'S SERVANT

IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY WHEN THE COMMONS ASSUMED LESS INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY COMPLAINTS OF GRIEVANCES WERE USUALLY PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE BY ANY MEMBERS WHO HAD HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THEM
THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH INFINITE SHAME AND REMORSE THE ERRORS OF HIS EARLY CONDUCT WHEN THEIR PLAUSIBLE PRETENCES HAD SEDUCED HIM TO TREAD WITH THEM THE PATHS OF REBELLION AND BEAR ARMS AGAINST HIS PRINCE AND COUNTRY
WHO COULD NOT WITHOUT DANGER HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER ANY CONSIDERABLE BODY OF HIS MUTINOUS ARMY IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS IT
FIENNES THURLOE WHITLOCKE WOLSELEY WHO COULD ONLY ASSIST HIM WITH THEIR ADVICE AND OPINION
HE FORMS ONE OF THE MOST PERFECT CHARACTERS OF THE AGE AND THE LEAST STAINED WITH THOSE ERRORS AND VIOLENCES WHICH WERE THEN SO PREDOMINANT
AND EVEN HIS PERSONAL AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING HIS YOUTH WAS CONSIDERABLE
AND THE PUBLIC ITSELF HAD BECOME SO SENSIBLE OF THE NECESSITY THAT THOSE ANCIENT LAWS IN FAVOR OF PERSONAL LIBERTY WHILE OFTEN VIOLATED HAD NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED OR REVIVED DURING THE COURSE OF NEAR THREE CENTURIES
BUT THE PRINCIPLES AND REASONINGS AND BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN THE TRIAL WERE MUCH CANVASSED AND INQUIRED INTO
ALL THESE OBVIOUS CONSIDERATIONS HAD NO INFLUENCE
BUT HE COULD NOT HAVE EMPLOYED ANY BRANCH OF PREROGATIVE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DISAGREEABLE OR WOULD HAVE APPEARED MORE EXCEPTIONABLE TO HIS PROTESTANT SUBJECTS
1636 THE EFFECTS OF SHIP MONEY BEGAN NOW TO APPEAR
IN PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT
IN MANY ACTIONS INDISCRETION AND IMPRUDENCE
BUT HIS CHAPLAINS BY THEIR PRAYERS VISIONS AND REVELATIONS SO BUOYED UP HIS HOPES THAT HE BEGAN TO BELIEVE HIS LIFE OUT OF ALL DANGER
THE OFFICERS PRESSED HIM TO TELL WHAT IT MIGHT BE
AND EVEN THE COURAGE AND FIDELITY OF MOST MEN BY THE VARIETY OF INCIDENTS HAD BEEN PUT TO TRIAL
THE VENGEANCE OF THE COVENANTERS WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH MONTROSE'S EXECUTION
CLARENDON LIFE OF LORD BERWICK ETC
HAVING AT LAST ASSEMBLED AN ARMY OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND MEN HE ADVANCED UPON THE PARLIAMENTARY GARRISONS
941
BOOK III
SEVEN PEERS WERE IMPEACHED
CHARLES FINDING THAT NOTHING LESS WOULD SATISFY HIS PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE AT LAST GAVE HIS ASSENT TO THIS BILL WHICH PRODUCED SO GREAT AN INNOVATION IN THE CONSTITUTION SOLEMN THANKS WERE PRESENTED HIM BY BOTH HOUSES
429
429
429
AND OPERATIONS IN THE FIELD CONCURRING IN THE SAME PERNICIOUS END WITH DELIBERATIONS IN THE CABINET CIVIL COMMOTIONS WILL FOREVER BE PERPETUATED IN THE NATION
BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE WAS BUT AN UNEQUAL MATCH IN THAT CONTEST FOR A YOUNG COURTIER ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY
BEING COMMISSIONED BY THE TABLES TO WAIT UPON THE KING WHILE THE ROYAL ARMY LAY AT BERWICK HE WAS SO GAINED BY THE CIVILITIES AND CARESSES OF THAT MONARCH THAT HE THENCEFORTH DEVOTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY THOUGH SECRETLY TO HIS SERVICE AND ENTERED INTO A CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM
TO-DAY A SENTENCE OF THE STAR CHAMBER WAS EXCLAIMED AGAINST
FROM CHARLES I
THE EXCISE DURING THE CIVIL WARS WAS LEVIED ON BREAD FLESH-MEAT AS WELL AS BEER ALE STRONG WATERS AND MANY OTHER COMMODITIES
AND HE ADDED THAT THE AFFAIRS OF THE KINGDOM PRESS HIM SO THAT HE COULD NOT CONTINUE THE SESSION ABOVE A WEEK OR TWO LONGER
THE LATTER DESIRED TO REMOVE HIM TO A DISTANCE AND HOPED DURING HIS ABSENCE TO GAIN THE ASCENDANT OVER FAIRFAX WHOM HE HAD SO LONG BLINDED BY HIS HYPOCRITICAL PROFESSIONS
THEY STILL PLEAD THE VIOLATIONS OF LIBERTY ATTEMPTED BY THE KING AFTER GRANTING THE PETITION OF RIGHT
THEY INSISTED THAT MERCY WAS PREFERABLE TO SACRIFICE
SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
THEY HAD BEEN NECESSITATED THEY SAID TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE OF THE WOMEN OF TEKOAH
THE GREAT MIND OF THIS SUCCESSFUL USURPER WAS INTENT ON SPREADING THE RENOWN OF THE ENGLISH NATION
THOUGH SOME PERSONS OF FAMILY AND DISTINCTION WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE CATHOLIC SUPERSTITION IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE NUMBERS OF THAT SECT DID NOT AMOUNT TO THE FORTIETH PART OF THE NATION
AND THAT HAVING BY FORCE RENDERED HIMSELF MASTER OF THE KING'S PERSON AND BY FAIR PRETENCES ACQUIRED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE ROYALISTS HE HAD EMPLOYED THESE ADVANTAGES TO THE ENSLAVING OF THE PARLIAMENT
THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
AND THE ARMAMENT OF HAMILTON'S PARTY THOUGH SECONDED BY ALL THE CIVIL POWER WENT ON BUT SLOWLY
RUSK
AND ENDEAVORED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE NAME OF PARLIAMENT SO PASSIONATELY CHERISHED BY THE ENGLISH NATION THE HOUSE OF PEERS WAS PRETTY FULL
AND AGREEABLY TO THE NATURAL ARDOR OF HIS GENIUS HE HAD EMPLOYED HIMSELF DURING THE FIRST SCOTTISH INSURRECTION WITH GREAT ZEAL AS WELL AS SUCCESS IN LEVYING AND CONDUCTING THEIR ARMIES
AND WHEN THE SERVICE WAS ENDED THE BISHOP GOING HOME WAS ATTACKED AND NARROWLY ESCAPED FROM THE HANDS OF THE ENRAGED MULTITUDE
A SINGLE MONUMENT OF HIS HEROIC SPIRIT AND NO DESPICABLE PROOF OF HIS POETICAL GENIUS
487
487
AND WHEN THEY JOINED THE ROYALISTS OF ESSEX AND THREW THEMSELVES INTO COLCHESTER HE LAID SIEGE TO THAT PLACE WHICH DEFENDED ITSELF TO THE LAST EXTREMITY
THE OTHER SQUADRON WAS NOT EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL
AMONG THOSE OF CONDITION WERE GRANDISON SLANNING TREVANNION AND MOYLE
TROUBLES AND TRIALS OF LAUD P
IN CONCERT WITH THE KING A CONSPIRACY WAS ENTERED INTO BY THE ROYALISTS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND A DAY OF GENERAL RISING APPOINTED
THE HOUSES CATTLE GOODS OF THE UNWARY ENGLISH WERE FIRST SEIZED
THE DEVIZES WERE SURRENDERED TO CROMWELL
WHEN THE KING LAID BEFORE THE HOUSE HIS NECESSITIES AND ASKED FOR SUPPLY THEY IMMEDIATELY VOTED HIM THREE SUBSIDIES AND THREE FIFTEENTHS
IT WAS REQUISITE TO CHANGE THE MAGISTRACY OF LONDON AND TO DEGRADE AS WELL AS PUNISH THE MAYOR AND SOME OF THE ALDERMEN BEFORE THE PROCLAMATION FOR THE ABOLITION OF MONARCHY COULD BE PUBLISHED IN THE CITY
EVEN THE DUKE OF SAVOY SO REMOTE A POWER AND SO LITTLE EXPOSED TO THE NAVAL FORCE OF ENGLAND WAS OBLIGED BY THE AUTHORITY OF FRANCE TO COMPLY WITH HIS MEDIATION AND TO TOLERATE THE PROTESTANTS OF THE VALLEYS AGAINST WHOM THAT PRINCE HAD COMMENCED A FURIOUS PERSECUTION
IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT NOW ANY SUCH INTENTION
LIPPINCOTT CO
WHILE THEY OBSERVED THE NUMEROUS FOES WITHOUT AND WITHIN WHICH EVERY WHERE ENVIRONED THEM AND REFLECTED ON THE WEAK RESOURCES BY WHICH THEY WERE THEMSELVES SUPPORTED
THE PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NOBILITY AND CLERGY COULD NOT FAIL TO PARTAKE OF THE DISCONTENTS WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THESE TWO ORDERS
HE MET WITH OPPOSITION FROM MANY AMONG WHOM CROMWELL DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF
BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD
BLAKE COMMANDED AND DEAN UNDER HIM TOGETHER WITH MONK WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR FROM SCOTLAND
AND IT IS HAPPY ALLOWING THAT MATTERS ARE REALLY CARRIED BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF MODERATION THAT THE CURRENT AT LEAST RUNS TOWARDS LIBERTY AND THAT THE ERROR IS ON THAT SIDE WHICH IS SAFEST FOR THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF MANKIND AND SOCIETY
P 269
AND IT WAS AN ORDER OF COUNCIL WHICH OBLIGED THEM TO DISEMBARK AND REMAIN IN ENGLAND
WHICH PROVES A VERY CALM AND DELIBERATE SPECIES OF NECESSITY AND ONE THAT ADMITS OF DELAY MUCH BEYOND THE FORTY DAYS REQUISITE FOR SUMMONING THAT ASSEMBLY
ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY THESE GENEROUS PATRIOTS SAW WITH REGRET AN UNBOUNDED POWER EXERCISED BY THE CROWN AND WERE RESOLVED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THE KING'S NECESSITIES OFFERED THEM OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS
THE PARLIAMENT THOUGH AT PRESENT DEFENCELESS WAS POSSESSED OF MANY RESOURCES
THE SOLDIERS DELIVERING UP THEIR HORSES AND ARMS WERE ALLOWED TO DISBAND AND RECEIVED TWENTY SHILLINGS APIECE TO CARRY THEM TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ABODES
HE PUNISHED WITHOUT MERCY ALL THE PRISONERS WHO HAD ANY HAND IN THE MASSACRES
BUT TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE SIR HARRY VANE THE SECRETARY TOLD THE COMMONS WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY FROM THE KING THAT NOTHING LESS THAN TWELVE SUBSIDIES WOULD BE ACCEPTED AS A COMPENSATION FOR THE ABOLITION OF SHIP MONEY
THE IRISH WERE GLAD TO EMBRACE BANISHMENT AS A REFUGE ABOVE FORTY THOUSAND MEN PASSED INTO FOREIGN SERVICE
123 ETC THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE COMMONS WAS STILL LESS DANGEROUS TO THE DUKE WERE IT ESTIMATED BY THE STANDARD OF LAW AND EQUITY
1255
OFFERED ANY REPARATION TO THE HOUSE FOR THE BEACH OF PRIVILEGE OF WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN THEY WERE RESOLVED TO ACCEPT OF NO SATISFACTION UNLESS HE WOULD DISCOVER HIS ADVISERS IN THAT ILLEGAL MEASURE
66
66

BUT AFFAIRS ARE NOW CHANGED
HIS UNHAPPINESS WAS THAT HE HAD A BETTER OPINION OF OTHERS JUDGMENTS THAN OF HIS OWN THOUGH THEY WERE WEAKER THAN HIS OWN
SOME NIGHTS HE LAY UPON STRAW IN THE HOUSE AND FED ON SUCH HOMELY FARE AS IT AFFORDED
HE WANTED THAT CONSOLATION WHICH COMMONLY SUPPORTS THOSE WHO PERISH BY THE STROKE OF INJUSTICE AND OPPRESSION
ADMIRAL LAWSON WITH HIS SQUADRON CAME INTO THE RIVER AND DECLARED FOR THE PARLIAMENT
THOUGH HE HIMSELF BEING THE SON OF A SECOND BROTHER INHERITED BUT A SMALL ESTATE FROM HIS FATHER
BUT THEIR DEMANDS WERE STILL TOO HIGH FOR AN EQUAL TREATY
AND NO LESS WAS REQUISITE FOR EFFECTING THE DIFFICULT WORK WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN
THE FRONT OF THE BATTLE WAS NOW EXACTLY COUNTERCHANGED
THE BEST TOPICS UPON WHICH HE COULD JUSTIFY AT LEAST APOLOGIZE FOR HIS FORMER CONDUCT WERE SUCH AS IT WAS NOT SAFE OR PRUDENT FOR HIM AT THIS TIME TO EMPLOY
THAT BY WHICH THE SCOTS BORN AFTER JAMES'S ACCESSION WERE ADMITTED TO ALL THE PRIVILEGES OF ENGLISH SUBJECTS SEMI-COLON INSERTED NOT IN SCAN THAT BY WHICH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS HAD BEEN WARRANTED
BUT EVERY APPLICATION FOR REDRESS WAS NEGLECTED BOTH BY THE COUNCIL AND THE PARLIAMENT
I ABHOR YOUR TREASON
AND ALL THIS DISTRESS THEY SUFFERED NOT FOR ANY NATIONAL INTERESTS OR NECESSITY BUT FROM VAIN POINTS OF HONOR AND PERSONAL RESENTMENTS OF WHICH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT TO THE PUBLIC
VOLUME THREE
AFTER TAKING WINCHESTER AND CHICHESTER HE ADVANCED TOWARDS GLOUCESTER WHICH WAS IN A MANNER BLOCKADED BY LORD HERBERT WHO HAD LEVIED CONSIDERABLE FORCES IN WALES FOR THE ROYAL PARTY WHILE HE ATTACKED THE WELSH ON ONE SIDE A SALLY FROM GLOUCESTER MADE IMPRESSION ON THE OTHER
AND THE VERY DAY WAS NAMED ON WHICH IT WAS AVERRED HE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE IN THE HOUSE
SUCH A PALPABLE DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN GIVING A TITLE TO A PRINCE AND POSITIVELY RECOGNIZING HIS RIGHT TO IT
THAT SUCH PERSONS WHO FATTEN ON THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR COUNTRY WILL EVER EMBRACE ANY EFFECTUAL MEASURE FOR BRINGING THEM TO A PERIOD OR INSURING FINAL SUCCESS TO THE WAR CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED
COLONEL INGOLDSBY WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE LATE KING'S JUDGES BUT WHO WAS NOW ENTIRELY ENGAGED IN THE ROYAL CAUSE WAS DESPATCHED AFTER HIM
AND HE HIMSELF CHANGING HIS DISGUISES AND PASSING THROUGH MANY DANGERS ARRIVED IN SCOTLAND
THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS OF THE KINGDOM MUST BE LEFT WASTE
AND BY CONTINUAL EXHORTATIONS REMONSTRANCES AND REPRIMANDS THEY STILL ENDEAVORED TO BRING HIM TO A JUSTER SENSE OF HIS SPIRITUAL DUTY
WE MUST HERE ENDEAVOR TO EXPLAIN THE GENIUS OF THIS PARTY AND OF ITS LEADERS WHO HENCEFORTH OCCUPY THE SCENE OF ACTION
THE STATES ALARMED AT ALL THESE STEPS SENT ORDERS TO THEIR AMBASSADORS TO ENDEAVOR THE RENEWAL OF THE TREATY OF ALLIANCE WHICH HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF BY THE ABRUPT DEPARTURE OF ST JOHN
IT MUST HOWEVER BE CONFESSED THAT THE KING WAS SO FAR RIGHT THAT HE HAD NOW AT LAST FALLEN ON THE ONLY EFFECTUAL METHOD FOR SUPPORTING HIS PREROGATIVE
AND THOUGH IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE POWER OF CROMWELL WHENEVER HE PLEASED TO HAVE SENT HIM THITHER YET SUCH A MEASURE WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INVIDIOUS IF NOT ATTENDED WITH SOME DANGER
THE EXPEDIENT WHICH THEY NOW MADE USE OF WAS THE WORST IMAGINABLE
BEING SUPPORTED PARTLY BY THE LECTURES OF THEIR ZEALOUS PREACHERS PARTLY BY THE DAILY HOPES OF RELIEF FROM ENGLAND
CALLED INTO PUBLIC LIFE HE STOOD FOREMOST IN ALL ATTACKS ON THE HIGH PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN
THE KING LEAVING A NUMEROUS GARRISON IN OXFORD PASSED WITH DEXTERITY BETWEEN THE TWO ARMIES WHICH HAD TAKEN ABINGDON AND HAD ENCLOSED HIM ON BOTH SIDES
THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE
CROMWELL IN THE RIGHT WING
BUT THOUGH IT WERE CERTAIN THAT FORMER KINGS HAD NOT IN ANY INSTANCE TAKEN NOTICE OF BILLS LYING BEFORE THE HOUSES WHICH YET APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN VERY COMMON IT FOLLOWS NOT MERELY FROM THEIR NEVER EXERTING SUCH A POWER THAT THEY HAD RENOUNCED IT OR NEVER WERE POSSESSED OF IT
MORE FITTED TO PROCURE ESTEEM THAN LOVE
AFTER SO SINGULAR A MANNER DOES NATURE DISTRIBUTE HER TALENTS THAT IN A NATION ABOUNDING WITH SENSE AND LEARNING A MAN WHO BY SUPERIOR PERSONAL MERIT ALONE HAD MADE HIS WAY TO SUPREME DIGNITY AND HAD EVEN OBLIGED THE PARLIAMENT TO MAKE HIM A TENDER OF THE CROWN WAS YET INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF ON THIS OCCASION BUT IN A MANNER WHICH A PEASANT OF THE MOST ORDINARY CAPACITY WOULD JUSTLY BE ASHAMED OF WE SHALL PRODUCE ANY PASSAGE AT RANDOM
BESIDES THE MILITARY OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL ARMIES WHICH LAY IN THE CENTRE OF ENGLAND EACH COUNTY EACH TOWN EACH FAMILY ALMOST WAS DIVIDED WITHIN ITSELF
1ST JUNE 1641 CLARENDON VOL
HAVING ASKED WHETHER THEY HAD ANY MORE INDIGNITIES TO PUT UPON HIM AND RENEWING SOME DEVOUT EJACULATIONS HE PATIENTLY ENDURED THE LAST ACT OF THE EXECUTIONER
1647 THE KING BEING DELIVERED OVER BY THE SCOTS TO THE ENGLISH COMMISSIONERS WAS CONDUCTED UNDER A GUARD TO HOLDENBY IN THE COUNTY OF NORTHAMPTON
SUCH ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THIS CHARTER BY OUR GENEROUS ANCESTORS THAT THEY GOT THE CONFIRMATION OF IT REITERATED THIRTY SEVERAL TIMES
TOTALLY DISCREDITED BOTH AS AN ADMIRAL AND A GENERAL
THE MAJESTY OF THE CROWN DERIVED FROM ANCIENT POWERS AND PREROGATIVES PROCURED RESPECT AND CHECKED THE APPROACHES OF INSOLENT INTRUDERS
A PRESENT OF FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WAS CONFERRED ON THE KING TEN THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DUKE OF YORK FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS ON THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
SO MUCH REASONERS WITH REGARD TO LAW HAD THEY BECOME FROM THE JEALOUS SCRUPLES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
IN AN AGE AND NATION WHERE THE POWER OF A TURBULENT NOBILITY PREVAILED AND WHERE THE KING HAD NO SETTLED MILITARY FORCE THE ONLY MEANS THAT COULD MAINTAIN PUBLIC PEACE WAS THE EXERTION OF SUCH PROMPT AND DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN THE CROWN
425
THE SEVERITY OF THE STAR CHAMBER WHICH WAS GENERALLY ASCRIBED TO LAUD'S PASSIONATE DISPOSITION WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF SOMEWHAT BLAMABLE
620
620
620
620
BUT HAVING RENOUNCED ALL CLAIM TO THESE USURPED POWERS HAVING CONFESSED HIS ERRORS AND HAVING REPAIRED EVERY BREACH IN THE CONSTITUTION AND EVEN ERECTED NEW RAMPARTS IN ORDER TO SECURE IT HE COULD NO LONGER AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR BE REPRESENTED AS THE AGGRESSOR
AT EVERY BENEDICTION HE IN LIKE MANNER BOWED TOWARDS THE EAST AND CRIED LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY AMEN THE SERMON FOLLOWED
IN THE OTHER WING SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX AND COLONEL LAMBERT WITH SOME TROOPS BROKE THROUGH THE ROYALISTS
OF ALL THE PROJECTS THE ONLY ONE WHICH TOOK EFFECT WAS THAT OF SIR GEORGE BOOTH FOR THE SEIZING OF CHESTER
THEY LEVIED MONEY UNDER PRETENCE OF THE IRISH EXPEDITION
AND THE PEN BEING DELIVERED TO MARTIN HE PRACTISED THE SAME FROLIC UPON CROMWELL WHITLOCKE P
TROMP AND UNDER HIM DE RUITER COMMANDED THE DUTCH
AND MONTROSE HIMSELF HAVING PUT ON THE DISGUISE OF A PEASANT WAS PERFIDIOUSLY DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES BY A FRIEND TO WHOM HE HAD INTRUSTED HIS PERSON
THIS PROTESTATION WHICH THOUGH JUST AND LEGAL WAS CERTAINLY ILL-TIMED WAS SIGNED BY TWELVE BISHOPS AND COMMUNICATED TO THE KING WHO HASTILY APPROVED OF IT
AND FINDING THAT PLACE UNTENABLE HE HIMSELF PASSED OVER INTO WALES LEAVING SIR RALPH HOPTON SIR JOHN BERKELEY DIGBY AND OTHER OFFICERS WITH THEIR HORSE CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TO MARCH INTO CORNWALL IN HOPES OF FINDING THAT COUNTY BETTER PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION CLARENDON VOL
AND HE PRETENDED THAT THOUGH HE HAD CALLED THEM THE PARLIAMENT HE HAD NOT THEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED THEM FOR SUCH THIS SUBTLETY WHICH HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY OBJECTED TO CHARLES IS THE MOST NOTED OF THOSE VERY FEW INSTANCES FROM WHICH THE ENEMIES OF THIS PRINCE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO LOAD HIM WITH THE IMPUTATION OF INSINCERITY
THE FOND IMAGINATIONS OF MEN INTERPRETED AS A HAPPY OMEN THE CONCURRENCE OF TWO SUCH JOYFUL PERIODS
1295
NOTE O P
BUT THIS SAME SPIRIT RENDERED THEM MORE DIFFICULT TO BE GOVERNED AND MADE THEIR CAPRICES TERRIBLE EVEN TO THAT HAND WHICH DIRECTED THEIR MOVEMENTS
SIR JOHN DENHAM IN HIS COOPER'S HILL FOR NONE OF HIS OTHER POEMS MERIT ATTENTION HAS A LOFTINESS AND VIGOR WHICH HAD NOT BEFORE HIM BEEN ATTAINED BY ANY ENGLISH POET WHO WROTE IN RHYME
AND THE PARLIAMENT BEING REDUCED TO A REGULAR FORMED SERVITUDE A DAY WAS APPOINTED OF SOLEMN THANKSGIVING FOR THE RESTORATION OF ITS LIBERTY RUSH
THE PARLIAMENT THEREFORE HAVING FIRST SUBSCRIBED IT THEMSELVES ORDERED IT TO BE RECEIVED BY ALL WHO LIVED UNDER THEIR AUTHORITY
EUROPE WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN THE RIVAL FAMILIES OF BOURBON AND AUSTRIA WHOSE OPPOSITE INTERESTS AND STILL MORE THEIR MUTUAL JEALOUSIES SECURED THE TRANQUILLITY OF THIS ISLAND
HIS DISCOURSE TO THE PARLIAMENT WAS FULL OF SIMPLICITY AND CORDIALITY
124 WARWICK P
UNDER COLOR OF THESE POWERS WHICH WERE SUFFICIENTLY EXORBITANT THE MAJOR-GENERALS EXERCISED AN AUTHORITY STILL MORE ARBITRARY AND ACTED AS IF ABSOLUTE MASTERS OF THE PROPERTY AND PERSON OF EVERY SUBJECT
497
UNDER THESE TWO HEADS MAY BE REDUCED ALL THE REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS OF THIS REIGN DURING SOME YEARS
AND HE VENTURED TO BUILD SHIPS OF A SIZE WHICH WAS THEN UNUSUAL
COL
THE KING WAS NOW WILLING ENTIRELY TO ABOLISH THE CANONS THE LITURGY AND THE HIGH COMMISSION COURT
THEN TOO WERE KNOWN THE DARK ARDENT AND DANGEROUS CHARACTER OF ST JOHN
ONE OF THEM HE NOW GAVE IN MARRIAGE TO THE GRANDSON AND HEIR OF HIS GREAT FRIEND THE EARL OF WARWICK WITH WHOM HE HAD IN EVERY FORTUNE PRESERVED AN UNINTERRUPTED INTIMACY AND GOOD CORRESPONDENCE
407
407
407
AND EVEN A FEW WEEKS AFTER STRAFFORD'S EXECUTION THIS VERY PARLIAMENT REMITTED TO HIS CHILDREN THE MORE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS SENTENCE
YET KING WILLIAM JUSTLY PASSES FOR A VERY SINCERE PRINCE
AND THE GREAT SUCCESS WHICH HAD ALREADY ATTENDED THE ARMS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND THE GREATER WHICH WAS SOON EXPECTED CONFIRMED THEM STILL FURTHER IN THIS OBSTINACY
SUCH PRIVILEGES ALSO AS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ALL FREE ASSEMBLIES WHICH DELIBERATE THEY MAY BE ALLOWED TO ASSUME WHATEVER PRECEDENTS MAY PREVAIL
MANY NEW WRITS WERE ISSUED FOR ELECTIONS IN THE ROOM OF MEMBERS WHO HAD DIED OR WERE DISQUALIFIED BY ADHERING TO THE KING
AND AS BY GOD'S GRACE I FORGIVE ALL THE WORLD WITH A CALMNESS AND MEEKNESS OF INFINITE CONTENTMENT TO MY DISLODGING SOUL SO SIR TO YOU I CAN RESIGN THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD WITH ALL IMAGINABLE CHEERFULNESS IN THE JUST ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR EXCEEDING FAVORS PERHAPS STRAFFORD HOPED THAT THIS UNUSUAL INSTANCE OF GENEROSITY WOULD ENGAGE THE KING STILL MORE STRENUOUSLY TO PROTECT HIM
HIS GREAT ENDS HE INFLEXIBLY MAINTAINED
96
96
UNDER COLOR OF PROVIDING FOR NATIONAL PEACE ENDANGERED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ENGLISH ARMIES WAS A CONVENTION CALLED
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ASSEMBLED AT BURFORD UNDER THE COMMAND OF THOMSON A MAN FORMERLY CONDEMNED FOR SEDITION BY A COURT MARTIAL BUT PARDONED BY THE GENERAL
HAVING MADE A BREACH IN THE WALL HE STORMED THE TOWN ON ALL SIDES
A REGARD TO THE KING SERVILE FLATTERY
CURSE YE BITTERLY THE INHABITANTS THEREOF
SHE SMILED AND REPLIED INDEED I HEARD HE WAS USED ILL
95
FOR A BETTER CONCEALMENT HE MOUNTED UPON AN OAK WHERE HE SHELTERED HIMSELF AMONG THE LEAVES AND BRANCHES FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
THE POWER OF IMPRISONMENT OF WHICH THE PETITION OF RIGHT HAD BEREAVED THE KING IT WAS NOW FOUND NECESSARY TO RESTORE TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE
THIS OFFICE WAS PERFORMED BY EIGHT OR TEN GIFTED MEN OF THE ASSEMBLY
HOPING AT LEAST IT MAY DO GOOD UPON OTHERS THOUGH NEEDLESS TO YOU BURNET'S MEMOIRS OF HAMILTON P
ABANDONING THEMSELVES TO DESPAIR REFUSING ALL SUCCOR THEY EXPIRED
URREY AT THE HEAD OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN MET HIM AT ALDERNE NEAR INVERNESS
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RETURNING TO A SENSE OF DUTY TOWARDS HIM WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS
AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED
ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIM THAT BELIEVES
THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT ISLAND WAS FIRST INTRUSTED TO FLEETWOOD A NOTORIOUS FANATIC WHO HAD MARRIED IRETON'S WIDOW
EVERY MAN HAD ADJUSTED A SYSTEM OF RELIGION WHICH BEING DERIVED FROM NO TRADITIONAL AUTHORITY WAS PECULIAR TO HIMSELF
WHETHER THERE WERE ANY EQUITY IN SECURING ONLY ONE PARTY AND LEAVING THE OTHER DURING THE SPACE OF SEVEN YEARS ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY OF THEIR ENEMIES
56 68 V WALKER P
AND THEY WERE AS DISTANT AS EVER FROM THEIR IMAGINARY SOVEREIGNTY
A PETITION FROM THE COUNTY OF BUCKINGHAM WAS PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE BY SIX THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS WHO PROMISED TO LIVE AND DIE IN DEFENCE OF THE PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT THE CITY OF LONDON THE COUNTY OF ESSEX THAT OF HERTFORD SURREY BERKS IMITATED THE EXAMPLE
AND IN RETURN FOR THIS CIVILITY ASCHAM WAS SENT ENVOY INTO SPAIN BY THE PARLIAMENT
296 352
WALLER WAS THE FIRST REFINER OF ENGLISH POETRY AT LEAST OF ENGLISH RHYME
AND EVEN TEARS OF AFFECTION STARTED IN HIS EYE WHEN HE WAS INFORMED OF THIS CONCESSION
HE WAS THE SON OF A WEAVER AND WAS HIMSELF BOUND APPRENTICE TO A SHOEMAKER
THE REFUSAL OF A DIVINE RIGHT TO PRESBYTERY AND THE INFRINGING OF ECCLESIASTICAL DISCIPLINE FROM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WERE TO THEM THE SUBJECT OF MUCH OFFENCE
OVERWHELMED WITH THE LOAD OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DREADING PERPETUALLY SOME FATAL ACCIDENT IN HIS DISTEMPERED GOVERNMENT SEEING NOTHING AROUND HIM BUT TREACHEROUS FRIENDS OR ENRAGED ENEMIES POSSESSING THE CONFIDENCE OF NO PARTY RESTING HIS TITLE ON NO PRINCIPLE CIVIL OR RELIGIOUS HE FOUND HIS POWER TO DEPEND ON SO DELICATE A POISE OF FACTIONS AND INTERESTS AS THE SMALLEST EVENT WAS ABLE WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION IN A MOMENT TO OVERTURN
AND THAT THEY WOULD SURELY RENEW THEIR HOSTILE ATTEMPTS IF NOT PREVENTED BY THE VIGOROUS MEASURES OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND OTHERS OF THEM HAVE BEEN THEREFORE IMPRISONED CONFINED AND SUNDRY OTHER WAYS MOLESTED AND DISQUIETED
LORD OGILVY WHO WAS AGAIN TAKEN PRISONER WOULD HAVE UNDERGONE THE SAME FATE HAD NOT HIS SISTER FOUND MEANS TO PROCURE HIS ESCAPE BY CHANGING CLOTHES WITH HIM
WITH SILENT TEARS OR LAMENTABLE CRIES THEY HURRIED ON THROUGH THE HOSTILE TERRITORIES AND FOUND EVERY HEART WHICH WAS NOT STEELED BY NATIVE BARBARITY GUARDED BY THE MORE IMPLACABLE FURIES OF MISTAKEN PIETY AND RELIGION THE SAVING OF DUBLIN PRESERVED IN IRELAND THE REMAINS OF THE ENGLISH NAME
AND BY THE POWERS OF THE PREROGATIVE HE GOT COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED WHO CONDUCTED THAT WORK AND DIVIDED THE NEW-ACQUIRED LAND AMONG THE SEVERAL PROPRIETORS
BUT NEXT DAY THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON WHOM NO ONE COULD SUSPECT OF BASE OR TIMID SENTIMENTS HAVING OFFERED THE SAME ADVICE IN COUNCIL IT WAS HEARKENED TO WITH MORE COOLNESS AND DELIBERATION
BUT FOUND THAT HIS AUTHORITY WHICH WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXCITE THE IRISH TO AN INSURRECTION WAS TOO FEEBLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR INHUMANITY
AN END WHICH HAD IT BEEN ATTAINABLE BY PEACEFUL MEASURES OUGHT CAREFULLY TO HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY EVERY LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY
HE ADVISED EVERY VIOLENT MEASURE FOR SUPPRESSING THE MUTINY
THOUGH WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR REASON BUT BECAUSE HE WAS THE MINISTER OF STATE WHOM THE KING MOST FAVORED AND MOST TRUSTED
HISTORY HOWEVER SUPPLIES US WITH EXAMPLES EVEN OF THIS KIND
493 504
MANY BEGAN TO WITHDRAW THEIR EFFECTS BEYOND SEA
HE DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHT OF ELECTION ALL THE SMALL BOROUGHS PLACES THE MOST EXPOSED TO INFLUENCE AND CORRUPTION
WHAT CAN BE IMAGINED TO BE THE KING'S PROJECTS
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THIS AUTHOR WHEN IN A HAPPY MOOD AND EMPLOYED ON A NOBLE SUBJECT IS THE MOST WONDERFULLY SUBLIME OF ANY POET IN ANY LANGUAGE HOMER AND LUCRETIUS AND TASSO NOT EXCEPTED
THAT I CANNOT BUT WONDER WHENCE YOU SHOULD GATHER ANY HOPES THAT I SHOULD PROVE LIKE YOU TREACHEROUS TO MY SOVEREIGN
SIDNEY FOUND THE SWEDISH MONARCH EMPLOYED IN THE SIEGE OF COPENHAGEN THE CAPITAL OF HIS ENEMY
431 V RUSH
NO MAXIM OF LAW IT WAS SAID IS MORE ESTABLISHED OR MORE UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED THAN THAT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT EXTENDS NOT TO TREASON FELONY OR BREACH OF PEACE
WHATEVER HARDSHIPS THEY UNDERWENT THOUGH PERHAPS DERIVED FROM INEVITABLE NECESSITY WERE ASCRIBED TO A SETTLED DESIGN OF OPPRESSING THEM AND RESENTED AS AN EFFECT OF THE ANIMOSITY AND MALICE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES
249 250 ETC
A BILL UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE HOUSES TO ABOLISH THESE TWO COURTS
INTEREST JOINED ITSELF TO AMBITION AND BEGAT A JEALOUSY LEST THE EPISCOPAL SEES WHICH AT THE REFORMATION HAD BEEN PILLAGED BY THE NOBLES SHOULD AGAIN BE ENRICHED AT THE EXPENSE OF THAT ORDER
GAYETY WIT AND INGENUITY ARE THEIR RULING CHARACTER
THE MORNING OF THE FATAL DAY HE ROSE EARLY AND CALLING HERBERT ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS HE BADE HIM EMPLOY MORE THAN USUAL CARE IN DRESSING HIM AND PREPARING HIM FOR SO GREAT AND JOYFUL A SOLEMNITY
THAT THE KING'S FORTS SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIM
THIS EXPRESSION WHICH THEN RECURRED EVERY MOMENT IN SPEECHES AND MEMORIALS AND WHICH AT PRESENT IS SO APT TO EXCITE LAUGHTER IN THE READER BEGAT AT THAT TIME THE DEEPEST AND MOST REAL CONSTERNATION THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
SUCH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEIR REASONING
THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES
CHAPTER LIV
THE QUAKERS CREPT INTO THE ARMY
WE FOUND THAT THE SCOTCH AND PRESBYTERIANS BEGAN TO BE MORE POWERFUL THAN WE AND WERE LIKELY TO AGREE WITH HIM AND LEAVE US IN THE LURCH
THE MARQUIS OF DOUGLAS THE EARLS OF ANNANDALE AND HARTFIELD THE LORDS FLEMING SETON MADERTY CARNEGY WITH MANY OTHERS FLOCKED TO THE ROYAL STANDARD
HE BETRAYED ONLY THE NEW CONVERTS AMONG THE PRESBYTERIANS OR SUCH LUKEWARM ROYALISTS AS DISCOURAGED WITH THEIR DISAPPOINTMENTS WERE RESOLVED TO EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO NO MORE HAZARDS
NOT ONLY WERE FORMER ABUSES REMEDIED AND GRIEVANCES REDRESSED
WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR SECURITY AND HAPPINESS AND WHO WAS VESTED WITH AMPLE DISCRETIONARY POWERS FOR THAT SALUTARY PURPOSE
THE BISHOPS ELECTED EIGHT TEMPORAL LORDS
AND THEY DEEMED IT SUPERFLUOUS TO ATTEMPT THE FORMAL REPEAL OF STATUTES WHICH THEY FOUND SO MANY EXPEDIENTS AND PRETENCES TO ELUDE
MORALS WITH THIS SECT WERE CARRIED OR AFFECTED TO BE CARRIED TO THE SAME DEGREE OF EXTRAVAGANCE AS RELIGION
RICHARD WAS A PERSON POSSESSED OF THE MOST PEACEABLE INOFFENSIVE UNAMBITIOUS CHARACTER
AND EVERY MAN EXPECTED WITH THE UTMOST ANXIETY THE EVENT OF THAT IMPORTANT ENTERPRISE ESSEX CARRYING WITH HIM A WELL-APPOINTED ARMY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN TOOK THE ROAD OF BEDFORD AND LEICESTER
AN IMPEACHMENT WAS RESOLVED ON
AND THE FIRST PARLIAMENT OF EACH REIGN HAD USUALLY BY VOTE CONFERRED ON THE PRINCE WHAT THEY FOUND HIM ALREADY IN POSSESSION OF
NEITHER THE DISSIPATION INCIDENT TO YOUTH NOR THE PLEASURES ATTENDING A HIGH FORTUNE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THIS VIRTUOUS PRINCE FROM EMBRACING THE MOST SINCERE SENTIMENTS OF RELIGION
BUT FINDING THAT HE HAD GONE TOO FAR TO RETREAT AND THAT HE POSSESSED NO RESOURCE IN CASE OF A RUPTURE HE AT LAST AFFIXED THE ROYAL SANCTION TO THIS EXCELLENT BILL
AND THE MANY HORRIBLE MURDERS TREASONS AND IMPIETIES FOR WHICH HE WAS NOW TO BE BROUGHT TO CONDIGN PUNISHMENT
AND THOUGH A MAN MAY IMPUTE HIS OWN FOLLY AND BLINDNESS TO PROVIDENCE SINFULLY YET IT MUST BE AT MY PERIL
AND THAT HE MIGHT FACILITATE AN END SEEMINGLY SO DESIRABLE HE OFFERED TO EMPLOY MEANS EQUALLY POPULAR A UNIVERSAL ACT OF OBLIVION AND A TOLERATION OR INDULGENCE TO TENDER CONSCIENCES
AND THENCE BERKELEY AND LEG WHO WERE NOT IN THE SECRET CONJECTURED THAT HIS INTENTION WAS TO TRANSPORT HIMSELF BEYOND SEA
CROMWELL APPEARED TO BE MUCH AFFECTED BY HIS DEATH
THEY VOTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MEETING OR GENERAL COUNCIL OF OFFICERS EXCEPT WITH THE PROTECTOR'S CONSENT OR BY HIS ORDERS
THE ROYALISTS IN LIKE MANNER WERE IMPATIENT TO BRING THE AFFAIR TO A DECISION BEFORE RUTHVEN'S ARMY SHOULD RECEIVE SO CONSIDERABLE A REENFORCEMENT
OVERTON RICH OKEY OFFICERS OF RANK IN THE ARMY WERE ACTUATED WITH LIKE PRINCIPLES AND CROMWELL WAS OBLIGED TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR COMMISSIONS
THE PRINCE OF WALES IN PURSUANCE OF THE KING'S ORDERS RETIRED TO SCILLY THENCE TO JERSEY
HE GAVE ORDERS IMMEDIATELY FOR AN ATTACK
YET WERE THE COMMONS FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED WITH THIS IMPORTANT CONCESSION
THIS GOOD PRINCE WHO WAS EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO HIS CONSORT AND WHO PASSIONATELY WISHED TO RENDER HER POPULAR IN THE NATION FORGOT NOT AMIDST ALL HIS DISTRESS THE INTERESTS OF HIS DOMESTIC TENDERNESS IN ORDER TO SUBSIST BOTH ARMIES FOR THE KING WAS OBLIGED IN ORDER TO SAVE THE NORTHERN COUNTIES TO PAY HIS ENEMIES CHARLES WROTE TO THE CITY DESIRING A LOAN OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
AND THEREFORE CAN THE BETTER DIGEST WHATEVER BEFALLS ME NOT DOUBTING BUT GOD'S PROVIDENCE WILL RESTRAIN OUR ENEMIES POWER AND TURN THEIR FIERCENESS INTO HIS PRAISE
AND IN THE NIGHT THE KING ACCOMPANIED BY NONE BUT DR HUDSON AND MR ASHBURNHAM WENT OUT AT THAT GATE WHICH LEADS TO LONDON
SUCH A PANIC SEIZED THE WHOLE ENGLISH ARMY THAT THE FORCES AT NEWCASTLE FLED IMMEDIATELY TO DURHAM
RUSHWORTH VOL I
RUSHWORTH VOL I

AND UPON HIS PROMISING THEM A NEW GUARD UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE EARL OF LINDESEY THEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSED THE OFFER AN WERE WELL PLEASED TO INSINUATE BY THIS INSTANCE OF JEALOUSY THAT THEIR DANGER CHIEFLY AROSE FROM THE KING HIMSELF CLARENDON VOL
THOUGH MONK PRETENDED NOT TO FAVOR THESE ADDRESSES THAT RAY OF HOPE WHICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CHARACTER AND SITUATION AFFORDED MIGHTILY ANIMATED ALL MEN
BY THE DAILY HARANGUES AND INVECTIVES AGAINST ILLEGAL USURPATIONS NOT ONLY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS INFLAMED THEMSELVES WITH THE HIGHEST ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE COURT
THE BISHOPS THERE SET FORTH THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
THE REMNANTS OF THE VANQUISHED THREW THEMSELVES INTO PEMBROKE AND WERE THERE CLOSELY BESIEGED AND SOON AFTER TAKEN BY CROMWELL
EXERTED GREAT SEVERITY TOWARDS THAT UNIVERSITY WHICH ZEALOUSLY ADHERED TO THE ROYAL PARTY
FEW IN THEIR JUDGMENT DISAPPROVED OF IT
BLAKE CASTING ANCHOR BEFORE LEGHORN DEMANDED AND OBTAINED FROM THE DUKE OF TUSCANY REPARATION FOR SOME LOSSES WHICH THE ENGLISH COMMERCE HAD FORMERLY SUSTAINED FROM HIM
THE BANISHED QUEEN HAD A MODERATE PENSION ASSIGNED HER
OR RATHER BY NOURISHING IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL THE HIGHEST RAPTURES AND ECSTASIES OF DEVOTION IT CONSECRATED IN A MANNER EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND IN HIS OWN EYES BESTOWED A CHARACTER ON HIM MUCH SUPERIOR TO WHAT FORMS AND CEREMONIOUS INSTITUTIONS COULD ALONE CONFER
TOO LIGHTLY PERHAPS MOVED BY THE APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY THE KING HAD EVEN ASSUMED POWERS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS MOST ZEALOUS PARTISANS ENTIRELY TO JUSTIFY HIS CONDUCT EXCEPT BY TOPICS SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEY WERE MORE FITTED IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS TO INFLAME THAN APPEASE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT
AS MUCH AS THE BOLD AND VIVID SPIRIT OF MONTROSE PROMPTED HIM TO ENTERPRISING MEASURES AS MUCH WAS THE CAUTIOUS TEMPER OF HAMILTON INCLINED TO SUCH AS WERE MODERATE AND DILATORY
THE FALSEHOOD AS WELL AS INDIGNITY OF THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT BEGAT IN HIS BREAST AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE AGAINST IT
HE NEVER REFUSED THEM SEPARATE PLACES OF WORSHIP BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE ESTEEMED IT IMPIOUS TO DEMAND THEM AND NO LESS IMPIOUS TO ALLOW THEM FOOTNOTE 16
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISTRACTED AND HELPLESS CONDITION OF ENGLAND NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE EITHER BY FRANCE OR SPAIN TO INVADE THEIR ENEMY NOR DID THEY ENTERTAIN ANY FURTHER PROJECT THAN TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE FEEBLE AND ILL-CONCERTED EXPEDITIONS OF THAT KINGDOM
THEY APPOINTED MASSEY TO BE COMMANDER
SO GREAT ATTACHMENT HAD THE KING TO EPISCOPAL JURISDICTION THAT HE WAS EVER INCLINED TO PUT IT IN BALANCE EVEN WITH HIS OWN POWER AND KINGLY OFFICE
THOUGH THE REGULARITY OF IT MAY PERHAPS APPEAR SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL
AND THAT YOUR MAJESTY WOULD ALSO VOUCHSAFE TO DECLARE THAT THE AWARDS DOINGS AND PROCEEDINGS TO THE PREJUDICE OF YOUR PEOPLE IN ANY OF THE PREMISES SHALL NOT BE DRAWN HEREAFTER INTO CONSEQUENCE OR EXAMPLE
THEY CHOSE SEVEN PERSONS WHO SHOULD NOMINATE TO SUCH COMMANDS AS BECAME VACANT
LAMBERT AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF TROOPS WAS NO LESS DANGEROUS TO THEM THAN BOOTH
WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF THE POPULACE WHEN SUCH WAS THE CHARACTER OF THE MOST ENLIGHTENED READERS
AND WHILE THEY THUS PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR OPPOSITION TO THE PARLIAMENT THEY STRUCK A BLOW WHICH AT ONCE DECIDED THE VICTORY IN THEIR FAVOR
AND AT THE SAME TIME RECEIVED FROM HIS YOUNG MASTER A RENEWAL OF HIS COMMISSION OF CAPTAIN-GENERAL IN SCOTLAND HIS ARDENT AND DARING SPIRIT NEEDED BUT THIS AUTHORITY TO PUT HIM IN ACTION
THE SANCTIFIED HYPOCRITES WHO CALLED THEIR OPPRESSIONS THE SPOILING OF THE EGYPTIANS AND THEIR RIGID SEVERITY THE DOMINION OF THE ELECT INTERLARDED ALL THEIR INIQUITIES WITH LONG AND FERVENT PRAYERS SAVED THEMSELVES FROM BLUSHING BY THEIR PIOUS GRIMACES AND EXERCISED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD ALL THEIR CRUELTY ON MEN
37 EDW
CROMWELL PURSUED HIS ADVANTAGE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF EDINBURGH AND LEITH
AT LAST AFTER REPROACHING HIM WITH THE BLOOD SPILT DURING THE WAR THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE PREPARING BILLS FOR HIM
HE HIMSELF WAS INTOXICATED WITH NO FUMES OF ENTHUSIASM AND HAD MAINTAINED NO CONNECTIONS WITH ANY OF THE FANATICAL TRIBE
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE GARRISON OF HULL WHICH KEPT YORKSHIRE IN AWE A CONJUNCTION OF THE NORTHERN FORCES WITH THE ARMY IN THE SOUTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE AND HAD PROBABLY ENABLED THE KING INSTEAD OF ENTERING ON THE UNFORTUNATE PERHAPS IMPRUDENT ENTERPRISE OF GLOUCESTER TO MARCH DIRECTLY TO LONDON AND PUT AN END TO THE WAR RUSH VOL
INSTEAD OF THE SOLEMNITY OF HIS CORONATION WHICH WAS DELAYED THEY WERE RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD PASS THROUGH A PUBLIC HUMILIATION AND DO PENANCE BEFORE THE WHOLE PEOPLE
AND HE GAVE AUTHORITY TO ORMOND LORD LIEUTENANT TO PROMISE THEM AN ABROGATION OF ALL THE PENAL LAWS ENACTED AGAINST CATHOLICS
NOTHING THEREFORE COULD CONTRIBUTE MORE TO HIS INTERESTS THAN EVERY DISCOURSE OF PEACE AND EVERY DISCUSSION OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THAT BLESSING COULD BE OBTAINED
BUT MASSEY WAS RESOLUTE TO PRESERVE AN ENTIRE FIDELITY TO HIS MASTERS
SEVERAL REGIMENTS JOINED IN SEDITIOUS REMONSTRANCES AND PETITIONS SEPARATE RENDEZVOUSES WERE CONCERTED
SEE NOTE G AT THE END OF THE VOLUME WHITLOCKE P
THEY APPLIED THEREFORE TO ESSEX WHOM THE KING HAD LEFT GENERAL IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
1-647-STRAFFORD.JPG EARL OF STRAFFORD IN ALL ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS AND EVEN IN MANY CIVIL LAUD BISHOP OF LONDON HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THE KING
THE DUTY OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE IN MORE ANCIENT TIMES HAD BEEN COMMONLY A TEMPORARY GRANT OF PARLIAMENT
SHOW THE GREATNESS OF YOUR MINE RATHER TO CONQUER YOUR ENEMIES BY PARDONING THAN BY PUNISHING
CHARLES UNABLE TO RESIST HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE IRISH AS TO THE SCOTTISH AND ENGLISH PARLIAMENTS
CHARLES WHO WAS FORMING SCHEMES AND COLLECTING FORCES FOR THE RELIEF OF BRISTOL WAS ASTONISHED AT SO UNEXPECTED AN EVENT WHICH WAS LITTLE LESS FATAL TO HIS CAUSE THAN THE DEFEAT AT NASEBY FULL OF INDIGNATION HE INSTANTLY RECALLED ALL PRINCE RUPERT'S COMMISSIONS AND SENT HIM A PASS TO GO BEYOND SEA THE KING'S AFFAIRS NOW WENT FAST TO RUIN IN ALL QUARTERS
THE CRUCIFIX TOO THAT ETERNAL CONSOLATION OF ALL PIOUS CATHOLICS AND TERROR TO ALL SOUND PROTESTANTS WAS NOT FORGOTTEN ON THIS OCCASION IT WAS MUCH REMARKED THAT SHEFFIELD THE RECORDER OF SALISBURY WAS TRIED IN THE STAR CHAMBER FOR HAVING BROKEN CONTRARY TO THE BISHOP OF SALISBURY'S EXPRESS INJUNCTIONS A PAINTED WINDOW OF ST EDMOND'S CHURCH IN THAT CITY
ALL THESE SEVERITIES HE BORE WITH THE USUAL PATIENCE
AND IN THIS INSTANCE THE PUBLIC MIGHT SEE THAT POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AS BY THEIR VERY NUMBER THEY ARE IN A GREAT MEASURE EXEMPT FROM THE RESTRAINT OF SHAME SO WHEN THEY ALSO OVERLEAP THE BOUNDS OF LAW NATURALLY BREAK OUT INTO ACTS OF THE GREATEST TYRANNY AND INJUSTICE
THEY DREADED LEST BY A PARITY OF REASON LIKE ARBITRARY AUTHORITY FROM LIKE PRETENCES AND PRINCIPLES WOULD BE ASSUMED IN CIVIL MATTERS

BY THE SECOND HE WAS TO RECALL ALL HIS PROCLAMATIONS AND DECLARATIONS AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ASSEMBLY TO HAVE TAKEN ARMS IN THEIR JUST AND NECESSARY DEFENCE
AND WE FIND THAT THE KING IN A FORMER DECLARATION COMPLAINS LOUDLY OF THIS INNOVATION SO LITTLE FAVORABLE TO ROYAL AUTHORITY
MENTION WAS THERE MADE OF A LITTLE GREAT MAN AND IN ANOTHER PASSAGE THE SAME PERSON WAS DENOMINATED A LITTLE URCHIN BY INFERENCES AND CONSTRUCTIONS THESE EPITHETS WERE APPLIED TO LAUD
SOCIETY TERRIFIED HIM WHILE HE REFLECTED ON HIS NUMEROUS UNKNOWN AND IMPLACABLE ENEMIES
THE ESTATES OF ALL WERE BURDENED BY THE FINES AND CONFISCATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN LEVIED UPON THEM
EVERY MAN HAD FRAMED THE MODEL OF A REPUBLIC
468
468
HIS TROOP OF HORSE HE SOON AUGMENTED TO A REGIMENT
AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM
AND IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ALL HIS COURAGE AND DEXTERITY COULD NOT MUCH LONGER HAVE EXTENDED HIS USURPED ADMINISTRATION

THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS THUS WANTONLY IRRITATED BY THE COURT AND FINDING NO GRATIFICATION IN THE LEGAL IMPEACHMENT OF BUCKINGHAM SOUGHT OTHER OBJECTS ON WHICH IT MIGHT EXERT ITSELF
NOT TO BE UNPREPARED THEY EQUIPPED A FLEET OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SAIL AND TOOK CARE BY THEIR MINISTERS AT LONDON TO INFORM THE COUNCIL OF THE STATE OF THAT ARMAMENT
THE WORDS ARE THESE
HE HAD NOT HAD THE PRECAUTION TO BRING THESE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES
AND WHAT HAS SCARCELY EVER SINCE BEEN ATTAINED BY THE PRINCES OF THIS ISLAND HE COULD EITHER BE ACTIVE WITH DIGNITY OR NEUTRAL WITH SECURITY
SIR FAITHFUL FORTESCUE WHO HAD LEVIED A TROOP FOR THE IRISH WARS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SERVE IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY AND WAS NOW POSTED ON THE LEFT WING COMMANDED BY RAMSAY A SCOTCHMAN
BUT AMIDST ALL THESE GLOOMY PROSPECTS FORTUNE BY A SURPRISING REVOLUTION WAS NOW PAVING THE WAY FOR THE KING TO MOUNT IN PEACE AND TRIUMPH THE THRONE OF HIS ANCESTORS
AND ABOUND IN PANEGYRIC WITHOUT EXCITING ADMIRATION
THE TRAIN BANDS WERE ACCORDINGLY LEVIED LAUNCESTON TAKEN AND ALL CORNWALL REDUCED TO PEACE AND TO OBEDIENCE UNDER THE KING
AND MANY WITH REGRET WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY BACK THEIR OFFERINGS AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM
THERE WERE THE POLITICAL PURITANS WHO MAINTAINED THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY
THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR
CARDINAL MAZARINE SUCCEEDED RICHELIEU IN THE MINISTRY
69
69
WITH GREAT TEMPER AND DIGNITY HE DECLINED THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT AND REFUSED TO SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THEIR JURISDICTION
NOT DARING TO INTRUST THE TRIALS OF TREASON TO JURIES WHO BEING CHOSEN INDIFFERENTLY FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE COMMONWEALTH AND WOULD HAVE FORMED THEIR VERDICT UPON THE ANCIENT LAWS THEY ELUDED THAT NOBLE INSTITUTION BY WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS ISLAND HAS EVER BEEN SO MUCH DISTINGUISHED
AND DESIRED THAT THEY MIGHT MUTUALLY PLIGHT THEIR FAITH FOR A STRICT UNION BETWEEN CITY AND ARMY IN EVERY ENTERPRISE FOR THE HAPPINESS AND SETTLEMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND SO MANY STEPS IN A DANCE SO MANY PACES TO HELL

BUT THE CONJUNCTION OF A SUBJECT WITH THE SOVEREIGN WAS ILL RECEIVED BY THE HOUSE THOUGH DISGUSTED WITH THE KING THE JEALOUSY WHICH THEY FELT FOR HIS HONOR WAS MORE SENSIBLE THAN THAT WHICH HIS UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE IN THE DUKE WOULD ALLOW EVEN HIMSELF TO ENTERTAIN
BUT AS FOR THAT POOR PITIFUL FELLOW RICHARD SAID HE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
AFTER THE SUCCESSIVE DEFEATS OF MONTROSE AND HAMILTON AND THE RUIN OF THEIR PARTIES THE WHOLE AUTHORITY IN SCOTLAND FELL INTO THE HANDS OF ARGYLE AND THE RIGID CHURCHMEN THAT PARTY WHICH WAS MOST AVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
MULTITUDES ATTENDED HIM AND RENEWED ALL THE FORMER MENACES AGAINST THE MODERATE PARTY THE PULPITS THUNDERED
618
618
THAT A PRACTICE WHICH HAD BEEN UPHELD DURING TIMES THE MOST FAVORABLE TO LIBERTY COULD NOT IN COMMON PRUDENCE BE DEPARTED FROM WHERE SUCH UNDENIABLE REASONS FOR SUSPICION HAD BEEN AFFORDED
TAKE NOT THIS FOR A THREATENING ADDED THE KING FOR I SCORN TO THREATEN ANY BUT MY EQUALS
105
AS IF THEIR BUSINESS WERE CHIEFLY BY PROVOKING THE KING TO MAKE HIM VIOLATE HIS OWN SAFE-CONDUCT
THE MAJOR-GENERALS BEING POSSESSED OF SO MUCH DISTINCT JURISDICTION BEGAN TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE TITLE TO POWER AND HAD RENDERED THEMSELVES FORMIDABLE TO THE PROTECTOR HIMSELF
THE EARL OF HOLLAND WHO HAD SEVERAL TIMES CHANGED SIDES SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WARS ENDEAVORED TO ASSEMBLE FORCES IN SURREY
THIS WAS THE FIRST NECESSARY STEP TOWARDS THE PROSPERITY OF FRANCE
THEIR BANISHMENT FOR A LIMITED TIME HE WAS WILLING TO AGREE TO RELIGION WAS THE FATAL POINT ABOUT WHICH THE DIFFERENCES HAD ARISEN
ACTIVE AND INDEFATIGABLE IN HIS OPERATIONS RAPID AND ENTERPRISING HE WAS FITTED BY HIS GENIUS TO THE NATURE OF THE WAR
LORD ASTLEY WITH A SMALL ARMY OF THREE THOUSAND MEN CHIEFLY CAVALRY MARCHING TO OXFORD IN ORDER TO JOIN THE KING WAS MET AT STOWE BY COLONEL MORGAN AND ENTIRELY DEFEATED HIMSELF BEING TAKEN PRISONER
423 424
BUT WITH REGARD TO THIS GUILT AN ENDEAVOR TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS THE STATUTE OF TREASONS IS TOTALLY SILENT
FAIRFAX WITH HIS OWN HANDS KILLED AN ENSIGN AND HAVING SEIZED THE COLORS GAVE THEM TO A SOLDIER TO KEEP FOR HIM
BUSH VOL
THEY IMMEDIATELY VOTED THEMSELVES A PARLIAMENT
THOUGH THE PRESENT DISPOSITIONS OF THE PEOPLE MADE THEM REPINE MORE AT THIS SERVITUDE
MEN ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE PROTECTOR AND BY REASON OF THE OPPOSITION AMONG THEMSELVES IN PARTY AND PRINCIPLES NOT LIKELY EVER TO COMBINE AGAINST HIM
SWEDEN WHICH HAD ACQUIRED BY CONQUEST LARGE DOMINIONS IN THE NORTH OF GERMANY WAS ENGAGED IN ENTERPRISES WHICH PROMISED HER FROM HER SUCCESS AND VALOR STILL MORE EXTENSIVE ACQUISITIONS ON THE SIDE BOTH OF POLAND AND OF DENMARK
THE KING IN ORDER TO REMOVE THOSE FEARS AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE PERPETUALLY PLEADED AS REASONS FOR EVERY INVASION OF THE CONSTITUTION HAD OFFERED BY A MESSAGE SENT FROM CARISBROKE CASTLE TO RESIGN DURING HIS OWN LIFE THE POWER OF THE MILITIA AND THE NOMINATION TO ALL THE GREAT OFFICES
AND UPON DISCOVERY OF HIS INTENTIONS HAD BEEN OBLIGED FOR SOME TIME TO FLY THE KINGDOM
AND ROUSING ALL THOSE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS JEALOUSIES AGAINST KINGLY GOVERNMENT WHICH HAD BEEN SO INDUSTRIOUSLY ENCOURAGED AMONG THE SOLDIERS AND WHICH SERVED THEM AS A PRETENCE FOR SO MANY VIOLENCES HE RAISED A NUMEROUS AND STILL MORE FORMIDABLE PARTY AGAINST THE MOTION
HIS CAPTAIN BEING KILLED IN THE RETREAT AT THE ISLE OF RHE FELTON HAD APPLIED FOR THE COMPANY
ASSURED THEM OF HIS PERSEVERANCE IN THE MEASURES WHICH HE HAD ADOPTED
AND THEIR LITURGY WAS REPRESENTED AS A SPECIES OF MASS THOUGH WITH SOME LESS SHOW AND EMBROIDERY GREAT PREJUDICES THEREFORE WERE ENTERTAINED AGAINST IT EVEN CONSIDERED IN ITSELF
1651 THE DEFEAT OF THE SCOTS WAS REGARDED BY THE KING AS A FORTUNATE EVENT
THEY HAD EVIDENTLY SEEN IN THE TRIAL OF LILBURN WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM JURIES
52 61 62
THE LEVYING OF TAXES WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE COMMONS
TO PREVENT THESE DISORDERS MARTIAL LAW SO REQUISITE TO THE SUPPORT OF DISCIPLINE WAS EXERCISED UPON THE SOLDIERS
THE HARANGUES OF MEMBERS NOW FIRST PUBLISHED AND DISPERSED KEPT ALIVE THE DISCONTENTS AGAINST THE KING'S ADMINISTRATION
HIS VIRTUE WAS TINCTURED WITH SUPERSTITION
AND THE KING ATTENDED BY THE DUKE OF YORK HAD SECRETLY ARRIVED AT CALAIS WITH A RESOLUTION OF PUTTING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS
BUT REFUSED TO TAKE THE OATH USUAL IN THAT COURT THAT HE WOULD ANSWER INTERROGATORIES EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT LEAD HIM TO ACCUSE HIMSELF
BY HIS OWN CONCESSIONS BY THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND BY THE FORM OF EVERY BILL WHICH HAD GRANTED THIS DUTY TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WAS DERIVED ENTIRELY FROM THE FREE GIFT OF THE PEOPLE
AS THIS DECLARATION WAS AN OBSTACLE TO ALL TREATY SOME CONTRIVANCE SEEMED REQUISITE IN ORDER TO ELUDE IT
HIS ARMY DAILY INCREASED BOTH IN NUMBERS AND COURAGE
HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS
526
WHATEVER MAY BE THE TRUTH IN THIS MATTER,--FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FULLY TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH,--CHARLES NEVER TOOK A WEAKER STEP NOR ONE MORE AGREEABLE TO CROMWELL AND ALL HIS ENEMIES
THE ENGINE CONTINUED HE MAY AGAIN BE RESTORED TO ITS FORMER USE AND MOTIONS PROVIDED IT BE PUT UP ENTIRE SO AS NOT A PIN OF IT BE WANTING BUT THIS WAS FAR FROM THE INTENTION OF THE COMMONS
WHILE THESE DISPUTES WERE CANVASSED BY THEOLOGIANS WHO ENGAGED IN THEIR SPIRITUAL CONTESTS EVERY ORDER OF THE STATE THE KING THOUGH HE ENTERTAINED HOPES OF REAPING ADVANTAGE FROM THOSE DIVISIONS WAS MUCH AT A LOSS WHICH SIDE IT WOULD BE MOST FOR HIS INTEREST TO COMPLY WITH
AND EVERY MAN FOR SOME DAYS IMAGINED THAT HE HAD A SWORD AT HIS THROAT
THOSE GREAT SUPPORTS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY LAW AND RELIGION HAD LIKEWISE BY THE UNBOUNDED COMPLIANCE OF JUDGES AND PRELATES LOST MUCH OF THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE PEOPLE
BUT HE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE FORMS OF IMPRECATION WHICH THEY CALLED PRAYERS
BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS
AS A SPECIMEN OF THE NEW CEREMONIES TO WHICH LAUD SACRIFICED HIS OWN QUIET AND THAT OF THE NATION IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO RELATE THOSE WHICH HE WAS ACCUSED OF EMPLOYING IN THE CONSECRATION OF ST CATHARINE'S CHURCH AND WHICH WERE THE OBJECT OF SUCH GENERAL SCANDAL AND OFFENCE
MAY'S HIST
WHERE THEY EMBRACED WITH GREAT JOY AND SIGNALIZED THEIR VICTORY WITH LOUD SHOUTS AND MUTUAL CONGRATULATIONS AFTER THIS SUCCESS THE ATTENTION BOTH OF KING AND PARLIAMENT WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE WEST AS TO A VERY IMPORTANT SCENE OF ACTION
SIR MICHAEL LIVESEY DEFEATED THE EARL OF HOLLAND AT KINGSTON AND PURSUING HIS VICTORY TOOK HIM PRISONER AT ST NEOTS
BUT THAT STORY STANDS ON NO MANNER OF FOUNDATION AS WE HAVE OBSERVED IN A PRECEDING FOOTNOTE TO THIS CHAPTER
AND THESE UNHAPPY RELIGIONISTS SO OBNOXIOUS TO THE PREVAILING SECT COULD NOT HOPE TO REMAIN LONG UNMOLESTED
AND HAVING TAKEN POSSESSION OF READING AFTER THE EARL LEFT IT HE THERE ESTABLISHED A GARRISON AND STRAITENED BY THAT MEANS LONDON AND THE QUARTERS OF THE ENEMY RUSH VOL
SIR EDWARD WALKER'S HISTORICAL DISCOURSES P
SIR EDWARD WALKER'S HISTORICAL DISCOURSES P
AND WHEN THE FRENCH COURT APPLIED FOR A RECIPROCAL TOLERATION OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION IN ENGLAND THE PROTECTOR WHO ARROGATED IN EVERY THING THE SUPERIORITY WOULD HEARKEN TO NO SUCH PROPOSAL
IF I FORGET THEE DO NOT THOU FORGET ME AND WITH THAT ROSE UP AND CRIED MARCH ON BOYS WARWICK P

AS SOON AS ASSEMBLED THEY REPEALED THEIR ACT AGAINST THE PAYMENT OF EXCISE AND CUSTOMS
SHAKSPEARE WHOSE TRAGIC SCENES ARE SOMETIMES SO WONDERFULLY FORCIBLE AND EXPRESSIVE IS A VERY INDIFFERENT POET WHEN HE ATTEMPTS TO RHYME
THEY WILL CUT OFF THY BROTHERS HEADS WHEN THEY CAN CATCH THEM
HIS PICTURES DISPOSED OF AT VERY LOW PRICES ENRICHED ALL THE COLLECTIONS IN EUROPE
IN THE NINETEENTH OF THE LATE KING THE JUDGES DETERMINED THAT THE ADJOURNMENT BY THE KING KEPT THE PARLIAMENT IN STATU QUO UNTIL THE NEXT SITTING BUT THAT THEN NO COMMITTEES WERE TO MEET
THE PROTESTANT RELIGION ENCOURAGED WITHOUT THE PERSECUTION OR DISCONTENT OF THE CATHOLICS
MOST OF WHOM DURING THE CIVIL WARS HAD MADE A GREAT FIGURE AMONG THE PRESBYTERIANS
53
AND THE MOST INVIDIOUS PREROGATIVE OF THE CROWN IT WAS SAID THAT OF IMPRISONING THE SUBJECT IS HERE OPENLY AND SOLEMNLY AND IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES EXERCISED FOR THE MOST INVIDIOUS PURPOSE
IN 1632 THE TREASURER PORTLAND HAD INSISTED WITH THE VINTNERS THAT THEY SHOULD SUBMIT TO A TAX OF A PENNY A QUART UPON ALL THE WINE WHICH THEY RETAILED
HE TELLS US THAT STRAFFORD SAID SO TO HIS SON THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS EXECUTION BUT THERE ARE SOME REASONS WHY I ADHERE TO THE COMMON WAY OF TELLING THIS STORY
249
AND THAT HE DID NOT EVEN KEEP THAT NOBLEMAN A MOMENT IN SUSPENSE WITH REGARD TO HIS FATE BUT INSTANTLY TOLD HIM THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD SOONER LOSE HIS RIGHT HAND THAN EXECUTE SUCH A SENTENCE NOR WAS HIS LORDSHIP'S LIFE IN ANY DANGER
THE GREATEST DANGER STILL REMAINED TO THE ENGLISH
AND HE RESERVED NO LEISURE FOR THE CARE OF HIS TEMPORAL AFFAIRS
AND TAKE IT NOT ILL THAT I SAY OF A SPIRIT THAT IS LIKELY TO GO AS FAR AS GENTLEMEN WILL GO OR ELSE I AM SURE YOU WILL STILL BE BEATEN AS YOU HAVE HITHERTO BEEN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER CONFERENCE HELD AT WHITEHALL
UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
FINDING THE KING SUPPORTED BY MORE FORCES AND A GREATER PARTY THAN THEY HAD EVER LOOKED FOR THEY SEEMINGLY ABATED SOMEWHAT OF THOSE EXTRAVAGANT CONDITIONS WHICH THEY HAD FORMERLY CLAIMED
AND IF THE LOVE OF NOVELTY LED SOME TO ADOPT THE NEW RITES AND DISCIPLINE OF THE PURITANS THE REVERENCE TO ANTIQUITY RETAINED MANY IN THEIR ATTACHMENT TO THE LITURGY AND GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH
TROMP AN ADMIRAL OF GREAT RENOWN RECEIVED FROM THE STATES THE COMMAND OF A FLEET OF FORTY-TWO SAIL IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE DUTCH NAVIGATION AGAINST THE PRIVATEERS OF THE ENGLISH
BUT THE COMMONS WERE AFRAID LEST SUCH AN ARMY SHOULD BE TOO MUCH AT HIS DEVOTION
THE SPANISH MONARCH DEEMED THE MOST POWERFUL LAY AT GREATEST DISTANCE
HIS OFFICER OVERHEARING THE PRAYER BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND IN THE KING'S PRESENCE
THE POPE HAD SENT OVER TO IRELAND A NUNCIO RINUCCINI AN ITALIAN
EVERY MEETING OF THE COMMONS PRODUCED SOME VEHEMENT HARANGUE AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF THE BISHOPS AGAINST THE HIGH COMMISSION AGAINST THE LATE CONVOCATION AGAINST THE NEW CANONS
AND HE PRETENDED TO PAY ENTIRE OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT WHOM BEING NOW FULLY REDUCED TO SUBJECTION HE PURPOSED TO MAKE FOR THE FUTURE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS AUTHORITY
AND THE LATE USURPATIONS AMIDST ALL THE TRUST AND CARESSES WHICH HE RECEIVED FROM THE RULING POWERS WERE THOUGHT TO BE VERY LITTLE GRATEFUL TO HIM
A LARGE DEBT HE HAD PAID OFF
IN THE PARLIAMENT A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY AND A MUCH GREATER IN THE NATION WERE ATTACHED TO THE PRESBYTERIAN PARTY
THESE SUCCESSIVE CONCESSIONS OF THE KING WHICH YET CAME STILL SHORT OF THE RISING DEMANDS OF THE MALECONTENTS DISCOVERED HIS OWN WEAKNESS ENCOURAGED THEIR INSOLENCE AND GAVE NO SATISFACTION
THOUGH THE MOTIVE FOR GRANTING IT HAD BEEN THE ENABLING OF THE KING TO GUARD THE SEAS IT DID NOT FOLLOW THAT BECAUSE HE GUARDED THE SEAS HE WAS THEREFORE ENTITLED TO THIS REVENUE WITHOUT FURTHER FORMALITY
AND MANY NOBLEMEN WHO SECRETLY FAVORED THE ROYAL CAUSE NOW DECLARED OPENLY FOR IT WHEN THEY SAW A FORCE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM
THE TREASURY TOO WAS QUITE EXHAUSTED AND EVERY EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY HAD BEEN TRIED TO THE UTTERMOST
GREAT PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE WAS MADE BY LAW AGAINST THE RETURN OF LIKE COMPLAINTS
THE PEERS THOUGH THE SCHEME WAS IN PART LEVELLED AGAINST THEIR ORDER
THE NEIGHBORING STATES OF EUROPE BEING ENGAGED IN VIOLENT WARS LITTLE INTERESTED THEMSELVES IN THESE CIVIL COMMOTIONS
91 92
AND ALL GERMANY WAS OVERRUN IN AN INSTANT BY THE VICTORIOUS SWEDE
THEY SENT HIM TWELVE ARTICLES OF REPENTANCE WHICH HE WAS TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT LAUD'S SEVERITY WAS NOT EXTREME APPEARS FROM THIS FEET THAT HE CAUSED THE ACTS OR RECORDS OF THE HIGH COMMISSION COURT TO BE SEARCHED AND FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN FEWER SUSPENSIONS DEPRIVATIONS AND OTHER PUNISHMENTS BY THREE DURING THE SEVEN YEARS OF HIS TIME THAN HI ANY SEVEN YEARS OF HIS PREDECESSOR ABBOTT WHO WAS NOTWITHSTANDING IN GREAT ESTEEM WITH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
AND THOUGH DEEMED FAITHFUL TO THE PARLIAMENT THEY ALSO LAY AT A DISTANCE
THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR
LET THE REVENUE BE SETTLED SUITABLY TO THE ANCIENT DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR OF THE CROWN
BY SOME PROMOTIONS PLACE WAS MADE FOR ST JOHN WHO WAS CREATED SOLICITOR-GENERAL
AND HAVING PROCURED A REENFORCEMENT FROM THE KING SHOULD HASTEN BACK TO THE RELIEF OF THEIR FRIENDS
WHEN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AS IS WELL KNOWN WAS ALREADY SUNK INTO THOSE SUPERSTITIONS WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS CONTINUED AND AUGMENTED BY THE POLICY OF ROME

SINDERCOME HAD UNDERTAKEN TO MURDER HIM
BEFORE THE SURRENDER OF THE KING'S PERSON AT NEWCASTLE AND MUCH MORE SINCE THAT EVENT THE SUBJECTS OF DISCONTENT HAD BEEN DAILY MULTIPLYING BETWEEN THE TWO KINGDOMS
THE COLLECTION OF ALL HIS SPEECHES LETTERS SERMONS FOR HE ALSO WROTE SERMONS WOULD MAKE A GREAT CURIOSITY AND WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS MIGHT JUSTLY PASS FOR ONE OF THE MOST NONSENSICAL BOOKS IN THE WORLD
EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM
HIS PARADISE LOST HIS COMUS AND A FEW OTHERS SHINE OUT AMIDST SOME FLAT AND INSIPID COMPOSITIONS
AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE THE INHERITANCE OF MILLIONS WERE TOO VALUABLE TO BE SACRIFICED TO HIS PREJUDICES AND MISTAKES
THE IRISH IN THEIR WILD RAGE AGAINST THE BRITISH PLANTERS HAD LAID WASTE THE WHOLE KINGDOM AND WERE THEMSELVES TOTALLY UNFIT FROM THEIR HABITUAL SLOTH AND IGNORANCE TO RAISE ANY CONVENIENCE OF HUMAN LIFE
THE SCOTS TERRIFIED AT THE PROSPECT OF SO HAZARDOUS AN ENTERPRISE FELL OFF IN GREAT NUMBERS
AFTER THE PAST EXPERIENCE OF THEIR ILL HUMOR AND OF THEIR ENCROACHING DISPOSITION HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD NOT IN PRUDENCE TRUST THEM WITH A LONG SESSION TILL HE HAD SEEN SOME BETTER PROOFS OF THEIR GOOD INTENTIONS
AND FROM FORMER MERITS SUCCESSES AND SUFFERINGS THEY HAD ACQUIRED WITH THEIR PARTY THE HIGHEST CREDIT AND AUTHORITY
NOR THEY CONSENT TO ANY PROPOSAL FOR AUGMENTING THE STANDING ARMY TO FIVE THOUSAND MEN
877
BEFORE THE CIVIL WARS LEARNING AND THE FINE ARTS WERE FAVORED AT COURT AND A GOOD TASTE BEGAN TO PREVAIL IN THE NATION
AND NO HUMAN PRUDENCE NO HUMAN INNOCENCE COULD SAVE ME FROM THE DESTRUCTION WITH WHICH I AM AT PRESENT THREATENED
THE IMPETUOUS SPIRIT OF HOLLIS VIOLENT AND SINCERE OPEN AND ENTIRE IN HIS ENMITIES AND IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS
IF IN PRACTICE IT HAS OFTEN BEEN VIOLATED ABUSES CAN NEVER COME IN THE PLACE OF RULES
THAT BEING SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER AND UNCERTAINTY OF ALL MILITARY GOVERNMENT HE ENDEAVORED TO INTERMIX SOME APPEARANCE AND BUT AN APPEARANCE OF CIVIL ADMINISTRATION AND TO BALANCE THE ARMY BY A SEEMING CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE
HE SENT A LETTER TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN WHICH HE WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE A PARTICULAR DECLARATION THAT NEITHER HE NOR HIS PRIVY COUNCIL SHALL OR WILL AT ANY TIME HEREAFTER COMMIT OR COMMAND TO PRISON OR OTHERWISE RESTRAIN ANY MAN FOR NOT LENDING MONEY OR FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE WHICH IN HIS CONSCIENCE,[**JOINED-UP THOUGH NO HYPHEN HE THOUGHT NOT TO CONCERN THE PUBLIC GOOD AND THE SAFETY OF KING AND PEOPLE AND HE FURTHER DECLARED THAT HE NEVER WOULD BE GUILTY OF SO BASE AN ACTION AS TO PRETEND ANY CAUSE OF WHOSE TRUTH HE WAS NOT FULLY SATISFIED BUT THIS PROMISE THOUGH ENFORCED TO THE COMMONS BY THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE UPPER HOUSE MADE NO MORE IMPRESSION THAN ALL THE FORMER MESSAGES
BECAUSE THE SCOTS WHO WERE IN ARMS AND LYING IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD MUST BE AT LONDON AS SOON AS THE ENGLISH ARMY
AND WERE DESIROUS BY FIXING IT ON ANCIENT FOUNDATIONS TO INDUCE THE PROTECTOR FROM VIEWS OF HIS OWN SAFETY TO PAY A REGARD TO THE ANCIENT LAWS AND LIBERTIES OF THE KINGDOM
WHILE CHARLES LIVED EVEN THOUGH RESTRAINED TO THE CLOSEST PRISON CONSPIRACIES THEY KNEW AND INSURRECTIONS WOULD NEVER BE WANTING IN FAVOR OF A PRINCE WHO WAS SO EXTREMELY REVERED AND BELOVED BY HIS OWN PARTY AND WHOM THE NATION IN GENERAL BEGAN TO REGARD WITH GREAT AFFECTION AND COMPASSION
THE ONLY AVOWED AND OPEN TOLERATION WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS GRANTED IN ANY EUROPEAN KINGDOM
AND THEY ASSEMBLED A FORCE OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VETERANS
THOSE ON IRELAND NINE THOUSAND
THE FORTIFICATIONS NOT BEING COMPLETE OR REGULAR IT WAS RESOLVED BY PRINCE RUPERT TO STORM THE CITY AND NEXT MORNING WITH LITTLE OTHER PROVISIONS SUITABLE TO SUCH A WORK BESIDES THE COURAGE OF THE TROOPS THE ASSAULT BEGAN
BUT IN ATTEMPTING IT THE CORKSCREW DROPPED FROM HIS HAND
THESE WERE THE PRESSING BILL WITH ITS PREAMBLE AND THE BILL AGAINST THE VOTES OF THE BISHOPS IN PARLIAMENT
UNDER COLOR OF KEEPING THE SACRAMENTS FROM PROFANATION THE CLERGY OF ALL CHRISTIAN SECTS HAD ASSUMED WHAT THEY CALL THE POWER OF THE KEYS OR THE RIGHT OF FULMINATING EXCOMMUNICATION
SUCH PRIVILEGES AS ARE FOUNDED ON LONG PRECEDENT CANNOT BE CONTROVERTED
BETTER IT WERE TO LIVE UNDER NO LAW AT ALL AND BY THE MAXIMS OF CAUTIOUS PRUDENCE TO CONFORM OURSELVES THE BEST WE CAN TO THE ARBITRARY WILL OF A MASTER THAN FANCY WE HAVE A LAW ON WHICH WE CAN RELY AND FIND AT LAST THAT THIS LAW SHALL INFLICT A PUNISHMENT PRECEDENT TO THE PROMULGATION AND TRY US BY MAXIMS UNHEARD OF TILL THE VERY MOMENT OF THE PROSECUTION
AND POSTERITY HAS ADDED LITTLE TO THE ARGUMENTS SUGGESTED BY HIS INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
AND THE COUNTIES WERE ALLOWED NO MORE THAN THEIR USUAL MEMBERS
AND THOUGH DOUBTLESS MANY EVIL COUNSELLORS WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED THEIR ENDEAVORS YET THERE IS ONE WHO CHALLENGES THE INFAMOUS PREEMINENCE AND WHO BY HIS COURAGE ENTERPRISE AND CAPACITY IS ENTITLED TO THE FIRST PLACE AMONG THESE BETRAYERS OF THEIR COUNTRY
THE ARMY HAD LITTLE AMMUNITION SCARCELY EXCEEDING FORTY BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER
THE CLERGY EVERY WHERE LOUDLY DECLAIMED AGAINST POPERY AND THE LITURGY WHICH THEY REPRESENTED AS THE SAME
THAT INDOLENCE INCAPACITY IRRESOLUTION ATTENDED HIS FACILITY AND GOOD NATURE THE VARIOUS HOPES OF MEN WERE EXCITED BY THE EXPECTATION OF SOME GREAT EVENT OR REVOLUTION
THEY PROCEEDED NEXT TO INQUIRE INTO THE IMPRISONMENT AND PROSECUTION OF SIR JOHN ELLIOT HOLLIS AND VALENTINE THE AFFAIR OF SHIP MONEY WAS CANVASSED
IT EVEN ESTABLISHED A KIND OF SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AND ASSUMED THE SUPREME AUTHORITY WITHIN ITSELF
WHEN PRINCIPLES ARE SO ABSURD AND SO DESTRUCTIVE OF HUMAN SOCIETY IT MAY SAFELY BE AVERRED THAT THE MORE SINCERE AND THE MORE DISINTERESTED THEY ARE THEY ONLY BECOME THE MORE RIDICULOUS AND THE MORE ODIOUS
BUT WHEN A CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY IF DERIVED FROM THE OBSTINACY OF THE PEOPLE REQUIRED A NEW PLAN OF ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL PRIVILEGES HE THOUGHT MUST YIELD TO SUPREME POWER
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION
HE THUS PROCEEDED I CAN LIVE THOUGH ANOTHER WHO HAS NO RIGHT BE PUT TO LIVE ALONG WITH ME
13TH SEPT
THE WIFE WEEPING FOR HER BUTCHERED HUSBAND AND EMBRACING HER HELPLESS CHILDREN WAS PIERCED WITH THEM AND PERISHED BY THE SAME STROKE THE OLD THE YOUNG THE VIGOROUS THE INFIRM UNDERWENT A LIKE FATE AND WERE CONFOUNDED IN ONE COMMON RUIN
AND TO BEREAVE THEIR SOVEREIGN OF THIS ARTICLE THE ONLY ONE WHICH REMAINED OF HIS PREROGATIVE
BUT WAS ABLE BY THE MOST SATISFACTORY REASONS TO JUSTIFY THOSE MEASURES IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED
BUT AS NO PROVISION HAD BEEN MADE IN CASE OF FAILURE AND NO PRECISE METHOD POINTED OUT FOR EXECUTION THIS STATUTE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED MERELY AS A GENERAL DECLARATION AND WAS DISPENSED WITH AT PLEASURE
BUT HENDERSON WHO HAD EVER REGARDED AS IMPIOUS THE LEAST DOUBT WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN PRINCIPLES AND WHO KNEW OF A MUCH BETTER WAY TO REDUCE OPPONENTS THAN BY EMPLOYING ANY THEOLOGICAL TOPICS ABSOLUTELY REFUSED ALL DISPUTATION OR CONTROVERSY
THE PRESBYTERIANS SENSIBLE FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR PASSION FOR LIBERTY HOW EVER LAUDABLE HAD CARRIED THEM INTO UNWARRANTABLE EXCESSES WERE WILLING TO LAY ASIDE ANCIENT JEALOUSIES AND AT ALL HAZARDS TO RESTORE THE ROYAL FAMILY
THEY CONDEMNED HIM TO BE PILLORIED WHIPPED BURNED IN THE FACE AND TO HAVE HIS TONGUE BORED THROUGH WITH A RED-HOT IRON
IT WAS INSISTED THAT FORTY-EIGHT MORE WITH ALL THE MEMBERS WHO HAD SITTEN IN EITHER HOUSE AT OXFORD ALL LAWYERS AND DIVINES WHO HAD EMBRACED THE KING'S PARTY SHOULD BE RENDERED INCAPABLE OF ANY OFFICE BE FORBIDDEN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSION BE PROHIBITED FROM COMING WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE COURT AND FORFEIT THE THIRD OF THEIR ESTATES TO THE PARLIAMENT
HE ATTACKED THE NUNCIO WHOM HE CHASED OUT OF THE ISLAND
THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE KING DISGUSTED AT THESE POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AND LITTLE PREPOSSESSED IN FAVOR OF THEIR PRIVILEGES WANTED BUT A FAIR PRETENCE FOR BREAKING WITH THEM AND WOULD SEIZE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY ANY INCIDENT OR ANY UNDUTIFUL BEHAVIOR OF THE MEMBERS
NO PRIESTS WERE ADMITTED IN THEIR SECT
AS THIS SPECIES OF TREASON DISCOVERED BY THE COMMONS IS ENTIRELY NEW AND UNKNOWN TO THE LAWS SO IS THE SPECIES OF PROOF BY WHICH THEY PRETEND TO FIX THAT GUILT UPON THE PRISONER
SO LITTLE WERE THESE MEN ENDOWED WITH THE SPIRIT OF LEGISLATION THAT THEY CONFESSED OR RATHER BOASTED THAT THEY HAD EMPLOYED ONLY FOUR DAYS IN DRAWING THIS INSTRUMENT BY WHICH THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THREE KINGDOMS WAS PRETENDED TO BE REGULATED AND ADJUSTED TO ALL SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS
HE WAS STILL AS MUCH AS EVER ATTACHED TO HIS FAVORITE
MANCHESTER WARWICK AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS HAD LIKEWISE GREAT CREDIT WITH THE PUBLIC
THEY WERE STILL ANSWERED THAT THEY MADE USE OF THIS SCANDALOUS EXPEDIENT FOR OBTAINING THEIR WAGES
NO SOONER HAD CHARLES CONCLUDED THE PACIFICATION WITHOUT CONDITIONS THAN THE NECESSITY OF HIS AFFAIRS AND HIS WANT OF MONEY OBLIGED HIM TO DISBAND HIS ARMY
AND THE WHOLE FABRIC WHICH JAMAS AND CHARLES IN A LONG COURSE OF YEARS HAD BEEN REARING WITH SO MUCH CARE AND POLICY FELL AT ONCE TO THE GROUND
BUT IF HE SEIZE ONLY A FEW WILL HE NOT LOSE MORE FRIENDS BY SUCH A GROSS ARTIFICE THAN HE CONFINES ENEMIES
AND AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TERM HE INSISTED THAT HIS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OVER THE MILITIA SHOULD AGAIN RETURN TO HIM THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS AT FIRST DEMANDED THAT THE POWER OF THE SWORD SHOULD FOREVER BE INTRUSTED TO SUCH PERSONS AS THE PARLIAMENT ALONE SHOULD APPOINT BUT AFTERWARDS THEY RELAXED SO FAR AS TO REQUIRE THAT AUTHORITY ONLY FOR SEVEN YEARS
AND THE LATE ONE BY WHICH ARBITRARY IMPRISONMENTS WERE AUTHORIZED
THE VIOLENT IMPETUOUS BUCKINGHAM INFLAMED WITH A DESIRE OF REVENGE FOR INJURIES WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED AND ANIMATED WITH A LOVE OF GLORY WHICH HE HAD NOT TALENTS TO MERIT HAD AT THIS TIME NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PROFUSE LICENTIOUS LIFE ACQUIRED AN INVINCIBLE ASCENDANT OVER THE VIRTUOUS AND GENTLE TEMPER OF THE KING
BUT HAD HE LIVED EVEN IN THE PUREST TIMES OF GREECE NOR ROME HE MUST ALWAYS HAVE BEEN A VERY INDIFFERENT POET
BUT SO HIGH WAS THAT NOBLEMAN'S REPUTATION FOR EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY THAT ALL THE NEW COUNSELLORS AND INTENDED MINISTERS PLAINLY SAW THAT IF HE ESCAPED THEIR VENGEANCE HE MUST RETURN INTO FAVOR AND AUTHORITY
B
AND AS THAT BRANCH WAS MORE THAN HALF OF THE REVENUE AND THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT POSSIBLY SUBSIST WITHOUT IT IT SEEMED INDIRECTLY IN THE POWER OF THE PARLIAMENT TO CONTINUE THEMSELVES AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED
AND LEAVING OUR MAN AT THE GATE OF THE INN WHICH HAD A WICKET ONLY OPEN TO LET PERSONS IN AND OUT TO WATCH AND GIVE US NOTICE WHEN ANY MAN CAME IN WITH A SADDLE WE WENT INTO A DRINKING-STALL
THAT THE WRITS FOR ELECTIONS WERE ISSUED EARLY IN THE WINTER

THE HARSHNESS OF THE MATTER WAS EQUALLED BY THE SEVERITY OF THE LANGUAGE
THE LORDS OF ARTICLES WERE AN ANCIENT INSTITUTION IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
THEIR COMMERCE WHICH HAD MET WITH A SEVERE CHECK FROM THE SPANISH WAS TOTALLY ANNIHILATED BY THE FRENCH WAR
THE CHIEF IF NOT ONLY RESISTANCE WAS MADE BY ONE REGIMENT OF HIGHLANDERS THAT PART OF THE ARMY WHICH WAS THE LEAST INFECTED WITH FANATICISM
WE MAY REMARK THAT LORD CLARENDON'S TOTAL SILENCE WITH REGARD TO THIS SUBJECT IN SO FULL OF HISTORY COMPOSED IN VINDICATION OF THE KING'S MEASURES AND CHARACTER FORMS A PRESUMPTION ON TOLAND'S SIDE AND A PRESUMPTION OF WHICH THAT AUTHOR WAS IGNORANT
BUT NATURE CAN DO MORE THAN ALL THE PHYSICIANS IN THE WORLD AND GOD IS FAR ABOVE NATURE NAY TO SUCH A DEGREE OF MADNESS DID THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC ASSURANCES MOUNT THAT UPON A FAST DAY WHICH WAS OBSERVED ON HIS ACCOUNT BOTH AT HAMPTON COURT AND AT WHITEHALL THEY DID NOT SO MUCH PRAY FOR HIS HEALTH AS GIVE THANKS FOR THE UNDOUBTED PLEDGES WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED OF HIS RECOVERY
433

HE LEFT ONLY TWO SONS RICHARD AND HENRY
HE CHOSE SIR WILLIAM DEVENANT AN INGENIOUS POET FOR HIS LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
AND HOWEVER NEW IT WAS OR FANTASTICAL HE WAS EAGER IN RECOMMENDING IT TO HIS FELLOW-CITIZENS OR EVEN IMPOSING IT BY FORCE UPON THEM
MANY FAMILIES TOO WHICH HAD LATELY BEEN ENRICHED BY COMMERCE SAW WITH INDIGNATION THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR OPULENCE THEY COULD NOT RAISE THEMSELVES TO A LEVEL WITH THE ANCIENT GENTRY
REMOTELY ALLIED AS IS BY SOME SUPPOSED TO THE ROYAL FAMILY
FAIRFAX HAVING NEXT TAKEN BATH AND SHERBORNE RESOLVED TO LAY SIEGE TO BRISTOL AND MADE GREAT PREPARATIONS FOR AN ENTERPRISE WHICH FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE GARRISON AND THE REPUTATION OF PRINCE RUPERT THE GOVERNOR WAS DEEMED OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE
HE MAINTAINED A CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH LORD MAGUIRE AND SIR PHELIM O'NEALE THE MOST POWERFUL OF THE OLD IRISH
HEATHE'S CHRONICLE P
AND ALL OPPOSITION AND EVEN ALL BLAME VENTED IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION WERE TREATED AS THE MOST ATROCIOUS CRIMES BY THESE SEVERE INQUISITORS
A NEW JURISDICTION WAS ERECTED IN THE NATION
CROMWELL DURING THE INTERVAL HAD SENT WRITS TO HIS HOUSE OF PEERS WHICH CONSISTED OF SIXTY MEMBERS
EARTH ADAMS OF WARBLETON
AND ON PRETENCE OF RENDERING MORE SIMPLE THE DISTRIBUTION OF JUSTICE WERE DESIROUS OF ABOLISHING THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE WHICH SEEMED INTERWOVEN WITH MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT
VOL II
VOL II
VOL II
THIS COMMITTEE BY DIRECTION FROM BOTH HOUSES TOOK AN OATH OF SECRECY
THE OTHER MEMBERS WERE IN LIKE MANNER INTERCEPTED
INIQUITOUS TAXES ARE SUPPORTED BY ARBITRARY PUNISHMENTS
THAT PART EXPOSED TO FAIRFAX BEING BEATEN FROM THEIR POST RETIRED INTO THE CHURCH OF ACTON AND WERE ALL TAKEN PRISONERS
SUCH SEVERITIES WERE AFTERWARDS MAGNIFIED INTO THE GREATEST ENORMITIES
THIS YEAR CHARLES MADE A JOURNEY TO SCOTLAND ATTENDED BY THE COURT IN ORDER TO HOLD A PARLIAMENT THERE AND TO PASS THROUGH THE CEREMONY OF HIS CORONATION

48
HE ESCAPED WITH HIS LIFE
NOR WAS THIS RESOLUTION HE SAID PECULIAR TO HIMSELF
AND THUS THE PROJECT FORMED BY CHARLES OF FREEING THE COUNTRY FROM THESE MEN WAS UNFORTUNATELY DISAPPOINTED THE OLD IRISH REMARKED ALL THESE FALSE STEPS OF THE ENGLISH AND RESOLVED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM
THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND
2 3 ETC
THE LINES ABOUT THE CITY LEVELLED
ALL THE ROADS WERE FULL OF SOLDIERS HASTENING TO JOIN THEM
636
LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE RAISED AGAINST THIS ATTACK AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE MOST APPARENT PERFIDY AND BREACH OF TREATY INFLAMED WITH RESENTMENT AS WELL AS ANXIOUS FOR ITS OWN SAFETY THE CITY MARCHED ITS TRAINED BANDS IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND JOINED THE ARMY UNDER ESSEX
THIS COURT WAS COMPOSED OF MEN DEVOTED TO THE RULING PARTY WITHOUT NAME OR CHARACTER DETERMINED TO SACRIFICE EVERY THING TO THEIR OWN SAFETY OR AMBITION
THE INABILITY OF THE KING FROM HIS ESTABLISHED REVENUES WITH THE UTMOST CARE AND FRUGALITY TO EQUIP AND MAINTAIN ONE
IN THIS DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS IT WAS IN VAIN THAT THE KING ISSUED A DECLARATION IN ORDER TO CONVINCE HIS PEOPLE OF THE NECESSITY WHICH HE LAY UNDER OF DISSOLVING THE LAST PARLIAMENT.[V THERE WAS ONE IN 1586
AND HIS FORMER ASSOCIATES IN POPULAR COUNSELS FINDING THAT HE OWED HIS ADVANCEMENT TO THE DESERTION OF THEIR CAUSE REPRESENTED HIM AS THE GREAT APOSTATE OF THE COMMONWEALTH WHOM IT BEHOVED THEM TO SACRIFICE AS A VICTIM TO PUBLIC JUSTICE
THE KING HAD IN SOME INSTANCES STRETCHED HIS PREROGATIVE BEYOND ITS JUST BOUNDS
THEY SOON COMPLETED THEIR LEVIES
AND THEY CALLED THEM A COMMITTEE OF SAFETY THEY SPOKE EVERY WHERE OF SUMMONING A PARLIAMENT CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE
FROM HIS SUGGESTIONS CHARLES BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THOUGHTS OF LEAVING OXFORD AND FLYING TO THE SCOTTISH ARMY WHICH AT THAT TIME LAY BEFORE NEWARK HE CONSIDERED THAT THE SCOTTISH NATION HAD BEEN FULLY GRATIFIED IN ALL THEIR DEMANDS
DORISLAUS STEELE AND ARKE WERE NAMED ASSISTANTS
THAT THE CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE IMPOSITION OF TAXES
THIS INDEED WAS TRUE IN THE ORDINARY ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT
EVEN AFTER THIS INSOLENCE THE KING DURST NOT VENTURE UPON A FLAT DENIAL
IT IS SELDOM THAT THE PEOPLE GAIN ANY THING BY REVOLUTIONS IN GOVERNMENT
THE ECCLESIASTICAL SUBSIDIES SERVED HIM IN SOME STEAD
NOTHING COULD BE MORE OBVIOUSLY PERNICIOUS TO THE KING'S CAUSE THAN THE IRISH REBELLION
THESE SIXTEEN NAMED EIGHT COMMISSIONERS OF COUNTIES AND EIGHT BURGESSES AND WITHOUT THE PREVIOUS CONSENT OF THE THIRTY-TWO WHO WERE DENOMINATED LORDS OF ARTICLES NO MOTION COULD BE MADE IN PARLIAMENT
CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
BY AGREEMENT HE PROLONGED HIS DOLEFUL CANT TILL INTELLIGENCE ARRIVED THAT THE FATAL BLOW WAS STRUCK
WHAT MAY ANY MAN CALL HIS OWN IF NOT THE LIBERTY OF HIS PERSON
WALLER HAD APPROACHED WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE ROYAL CAMP AND WAS ONLY SEPARATED FROM IT BY THE SEVERN WHEN HE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE THAT THE KING WAS ADVANCED TO BEWDLY AND HAD DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARDS SHREWSBURY
INSTEAD OF THAT AFFECTED ADULATION INTRODUCED INTO MODERN TONGUES OF SPEAKING TO INDIVIDUALS AS IF THEY WERE A MULTITUDE THEY RETURNED TO THE SIMPLICITY OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES
1629 THERE NOW OPENS TO US A NEW SCENE
THE IRISH ACTUATED BY NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES COULD NO LONGER BE KEPT IN OBEDIENCE BY A PROTESTANT GOVERNOR WHO WAS SO UNSUCCESSFUL IN ALL HIS ENTERPRISES
DUBLIN TO SAVE ITSELF FROM STARVING HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SEND THE GREATER PART OF ITS INHABITANTS TO ENGLAND
HIS LONG SOLITUDE AND SEVERE AFFLICTIONS HAD CONTRIBUTED TO RIVET HIM THE MORE IN THOSE RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES WHICH HAD EVER A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER HIM
AND ALL THESE MIDDLE COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WERE IN A LITTLE TIME REDUCED TO OBEDIENCE UNDER THE PARLIAMENT
AND THE PRINCE WAS DESPOILED OF ALL HIS PREROGATIVE WITHOUT THE LEAST PRETEXT OF ANY VIOLENCE OR ILLEGALITY IN HIS ADMINISTRATION
HE CONTINUED HIS MARCH AND TOOK POSSESSION OF OXFORD THE ONLY TOWN IN HIS DOMINIONS WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER AT HIS DEVOTION
THE KING'S STATUE IN THE EXCHANGE WAS THROWN DOWN
THE PROOFS BROUGHT TO EVINCE THAT THIS WORK IS OR IS NOT THE KING'S ARE SO CONVINCING THAT IF AN IMPARTIAL READER PERUSE ANY ONE SIDE APART HE WILL THINK IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT ARGUMENTS COULD BE PRODUCED SUFFICIENT TO COUNTERBALANCE SO STRONG AN EVIDENCE
HE IS THE EARL OF STRAFFORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND AND PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF YORK WHO IN BOTH PLACES AND IN ALL OTHER PROVINCES WHERE HE HAS BEEN INTRUSTED WITH AUTHORITY HAS RAISED AMPLE MONUMENTS OF TYRANNY AND WILL APPEAR FROM A SURVEY OF HIS ACTIONS TO BE THE CHIEF PROMOTER OF EVERY ARBITRARY COUNSEL
111 DUGDALE P
FREEDOM OF INQUIRY DETESTED
BUT THE OPPOSITION RATHER INCREASED THAN ABATED THE ZEAL OF THE PRELATE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE HABITS AND CEREMONIES
ARMS WERE COMMISSIONED AND IMPORTED FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES
THIS ADVENTURE SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO THE FICTION OF HUDIBRAS
ARGYLE ALONE SEIZED WITH A PANIC DESERTED HIS ARMY WHO STILL MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AND GAVE BATTLE TO THE ROYALISTS
AND THEIR RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL DISPUTES AGITATED THE WHOLE KINGDOM
NOTES FOOTNOTE 1
MEN ALSO WERE APT TO THINK THAT WITHOUT SOME SECRET PURPOSE SUCH INSIGNIFICANT OBSERVANCES WOULD NOT BE IMPOSED WITH SUCH UNRELENTING ZEAL ON THE REFRACTORY NATION
EVEN AFTER HIS STANDARD WAS ERECTED MEN COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO APPREHEND THE DANGER OF A CIVIL WAR
THOUGH IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THEIR SKILL IN GOVERNMENT WAS NOT PROPORTIONED TO THE EXTREME DELICACY OF THEIR SITUATION A SUFFICIENT INDULGENCE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN THEM AND ALL THE BLAME BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS HAS BEEN UNJUSTLY THROWN ON THEIR SIDE
HE HAD OBSERVED WITH WHAT ALACRITY THEY HAD TWICE RUN TO ARMS AND ASSEMBLED TROOPS IN OPPOSITION TO THE RIGHTS OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
IN A LETTER OF THE KING TO THE QUEEN PRESERVED IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND PUBLISHED BY MRS MACAULAY VOL
TO BIND THEIR KINGS WITH CHAINS AND THEIR NOBLES WITH FETTERS OF IRON
100 111 112 114 115 121 132 137
AND THIS FIRST AND PRINCIPAL STEP TOWARDS MORE EXTENSIVE CONQUEST WHICH FRANCE DURING A WHOLE CENTURY HAS NEVER YET BEEN ABLE BY AN INFINITE EXPENSE OF BLOOD AND TREASURE FULLY TO ATTAIN HAD AT ONCE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THE ENTERPRISING THOUGH UNSKILFUL POLITICS OF CROMWELL
TO-MORROW A DECREE OF THE HIGH COMMISSION
VANE WAS NOTED IN ALL CIVIL TRANSACTIONS FOR TEMPER INSINUATION ADDRESS AND A PROFOUND JUDGMENT
ABOVE ALL THE SICKNESS OF MRS CLAYPOLE HIS PECULIAR FAVORITE A LADY ENDUED WITH MANY HUMANE VIRTUES AND AMIABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS DEPRESSED HIS ANXIOUS MIND AND POISONED ALL HIS ENJOYMENTS
THE SOLDIER THE MERCHANT THE MECHANIC INDULGING THE FERVORS OF ZEAL AND GUIDED BY THE ILLAPSES OF THE SPIRIT RESIGNED HIMSELF TO AN INWARD AND SUPERIOR DIRECTION AND WAS CONSECRATED IN A MANNER BY AN IMMEDIATE INTERCOURSE AND COMMUNICATION WITH HEAVEN
THE IRISH EVERY WHERE INTERMINGLED WITH THE ENGLISH NEEDED BUT A HINT FROM THEIR LEADERS AND PRIESTS TO BEGIN HOSTILITIES AGAINST A PEOPLE WHOM THEY HATED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR RELIGION AND ENVIED FOR THEIR RICHES AND PROSPERITY RUSH VOL
BESIDES MANY SMALLER BODIES DISPERSED OVER THE KINGDOM THE PRINCIPAL ARMY OF THE REBELS AMOUNTED TO TWENTY THOUSAND MEN AND THREATENED DUBLIN WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE BOTH THE ENGLISH AND IRISH REBELS CONSPIRED IN ONE IMPOSTURE WITH WHICH THEY SEDUCED MANY OF THEIR DELUDED COUNTRYMEN
DURING THE REIGN OF JAMES HE HAD ATTEMPTED WITHOUT HAVING OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF THAT MONARCH TO MARRY ARABELLA STUART A LADY NEARLY RELATED TO THE CROWN
AND EACH OF THEM WAS REQUIRED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE ADJACENT COUNTIES TO ARM SO MANY VESSELS AS WERE APPOINTED THEM THE CITY OF LONDON WAS RATED AT TWENTY SHIPS
HE SAW SEVERAL SOLDIERS PASS BY
YOUR WARRANT SAID CHARLES SMILING IS WRIT IN FAIR CHARACTERS LEGIBLE WITHOUT SPELLING THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS CAME INTO THE ROOM
ALL THESE MOTIVES HAD UNITED EVERY PARTY EXCEPT THE MOST DESPERATE INTO ARDENT WISHES FOR THE KING'S RESTORATION THE ONLY REMEDY FOR ALL THESE FATAL EVILS
SEE CARTE VOL
THE EARL OF DERBY LEAVING THE ISLE OF MAN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO MAINTAINED HIS INDEPENDENCE WAS EMPLOYED IN LEVYING FORCES IN CHESHIRE AND LANCASHIRE
THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE THEY REGARDED HIM AS AN UNABLE AND PERHAPS A DANGEROUS MINISTER
THESE DISTRACTIONS AT HOME WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE OFF THE PROTECTOR'S ATTENTION FROM FOREIGN AFFAIRS
IT WILL BE AS THREAD AND BROKEN AS EASY AS THE BONDS OF SAMSON
HIS EARLY ENGAGEMENTS HAD BEEN WITH THE KING
AND BEING OF A MIDDLE STATURE HE WAS CAPABLE OF ENDURING THE GREATEST FATIGUES
THREE DAYS WAS THE COMBAT CONTINUED WITH THE UTMOST RAGE AND OBSTINACY
THE RICH AND MALECONTENT COUNTIES OF THE WEST HAVING LOST ALL PROTECTION FROM THEIR FRIENDS MIGHT BE FORCED TO PAY HIGH CONTRIBUTIONS AS AN ATONEMENT FOR THEIR DISAFFECTION
AND THEIR SIZE OF UNDERSTANDING AFFORDED HIM GREAT FACILITY IN DECEIVING THEM
21ST JUNE 1625
YET POSSESSED SO LITTLE AUTHORITY THAT THEY DURST NOT PERSEVERE IN OPPOSING THE RESOLUTION OF THE COMMONS
THE KING RODE BEFORE THE LADY AND PERSONATED THE SERVANT
AND HE REQUIRED THEM IN THE NAME OF THE CITIZENS SOLDIERS AND WHOLE COMMONWEALTH TO ISSUE WRITS WITHIN A WEEK FOR THE FILLING OF THEIR HOUSE AND TO FIX THE TIME FOR THEIR OWN DISSOLUTION AND THE ASSEMBLING OF A NEW PARLIAMENT
HE ATTACKED AT ABERDEEN THE LORD BURLEY WHO COMMANDED A FORCE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEN
THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY NOW AMOUNTED TO ABOVE TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND MEN AND WAS MUCH SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE KING AFTER BOTH ARMIES HAD FACED EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME CHARLES DREW OFF AND RETIRED TO READING THENCE TO OXFORD
IT MUST HOWEVER BE CONFESSED THAT THE WRETCHED FANATICISM WHICH SO MUCH INFECTED THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WAS NO LESS DESTRUCTIVE OF TASTE AND SCIENCE THAN OF ALL LAW AND ORDER
GREAT VIGOR FROM THE BEGINNING AS WELL AS WISDOM THEY HAD DISPLAYED IN ALL THEIR COUNSELS
HIS MOTHER LIVED TILL AFTER HE WAS PROTECTOR
LORD VOUCHSAFE YET TO TOUCH THE OBDURATE HEART OF THIS PROUD INCORRIGIBLE SINNER
AND THEIR MILITARY EXPEDITIONS WERE APPROVED OF AS ENTERPRISES CALCULATED AND INTENDED FOR HIS MAJESTY'S HONOR AND ADVANTAGE
NO FANATICS EVER CARRIED FURTHER THE HATRED TO CEREMONIES FORMS ORDERS RITES AND POSITIVE INSTITUTIONS
BUT HE IS NOT A GOOD SUBJECT HE IS A SLAVE WHO WILL ALLOW HIS GOODS TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM AGAINST HIS WILL AND HIS LIBERTY AGAINST THE LAWS OF THE KINGDOM
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS LATTER NOBLEMAN THE PACIFIC PLANS NOW COME TO GREAT MATURITY AND FORWARDED BY HIS VIGOR AND INDUSTRY SEEMED TO HAVE OPERATED WITH FULL SUCCESS AND TO HAVE BESTOWED AT LAST ON THAT SAVAGE COUNTRY THE FACE OF A EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT
BUT DID NOT PRODUCE ANY ACCOMPLISHED HISTORIAN
THE EARLS OF LOUDON LAUDERDALE AND LANERIC WHO WERE SENT TO LONDON PROTESTED AGAINST THE FOUR BILLS AS CONTAINING TOO GREAT A DIMINUTION OF THE KING'S CIVIL POWER AND PROVIDING NO SECURITY FOR RELIGION
THE GENERALS UNDER THE NAME OF FAIRFAX FOR HE STILL ALLOWED THEM TO EMPLOY HIS NAME MARCHED THE ARMY TO LONDON AND PLACING GUARDS IN WHITEHALL THE MEWS ST JAMES'S DURHAM HOUSE COVENT GARDEN AND PALACE YARD SURROUNDED THE PARLIAMENT WITH THEIR HOSTILE ARMAMENTS
THIS EVENT ALONE DECIDED THE BATTLE IN FAVOR OF THE ENGLISH
YET MADE NO HASTE IN BRINGING IT TO AN ISSUE
LORD SOMERS BY ENCOURAGING A GOOD EDITION OF IT ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE AUTHOR'S DEATH FIRST BROUGHT IT INTO REQUEST
THE COMMONWEALTH
BUT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY INTERPOSED AND PRONOUNCED THAT AS HE HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE COVENANT WHICH WAS PRESSED ON HIM IT BECAME NOT THE GODLY TO CONCERN THEMSELVES ABOUT HIS FORTUNES
BY AN INSULT STILL MORE EGREGIOUS THE VERY GIVING OF MONEY TO THE SCOTS FOR LEVYING WAR AGAINST THEIR SOVEREIGN THEY REPRESENTED AS AN INSTANCE OF THEIR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
BUT HER PROGRESS SLOW AND GRADUAL LEFT IT STILL IN THE POWER OF ENGLAND BY A TIMELY INTERPOSITION TO CHECK HER SUPERIORITY
WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
I DOUBT NOT BUT GOD IN HIS GOOD TIME WILL DISCOVER THEM TO ME AND THAT THE WISDOM AND COURAGE OF MY HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT WILL JOIN WITH ME IN THEIR SUPPRESSION AND PUNISHMENT NOTHING SHOWS MORE EVIDENTLY THE HARD SITUATION IN WHICH CHARLES WAS PLACED THAN TO OBSERVE THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFINE HIMSELF WITHIN THE LIMITS OF CIVILITY TOWARDS SUBJECTS WHO HAD TRANSGRESSED ALL BOUNDS OF REGARD AND EVEN OF GOOD MANNERS IN THE TREATMENT OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND HERE WITH CERTAINTY IF NOT HERE ONLY HIS MAJESTY MAY SEE AS IN A TRUE GLASS THE STATE OF THE KINGDOM
THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A NATIONAL CAUSE AND STRONGLY ACTUATED BY MISTAKEN PRINCIPLES
OTHERS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE MOST LABORED ELEGANCE OF COMPOSITION TO SUPPORT THEM
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ENJOY WHAT THEY WISH FOR THE KING HAD POSSESSED A GREAT PARTY IN THE LOWER HOUSE AS APPEARED IN THE VOTE FOR THE REMONSTRANCE
THE LAWYERS HAD DECLARED THAT MARTIAL LAW COULD NOT BE EXERCISED EXCEPT IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF AN ENEMY
BEING ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS OF FAR GREATER IMPORTANCE TO HIMSELF WHICH HE COULD NOT OMIT ON ANY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT CONCERNED THE SALVATION OF HIS OWN SOUL
FOUR TABLES AS THEY WERE CALLED WERE FORMED IN EDINBURGH
31
31
YET BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR WAS NEPHEW TO DR HAMMOND THE KING'S FAVORITE CHAPLAIN AND HAD ACQUIRED A GOOD CHARACTER IN THE ARMY IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER TO HAVE RECOURSE TO HIM IN THE PRESENT EXIGENCE WHEN NO OTHER RATIONAL EXPEDIENT COULD BE THOUGHT OF
IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN SOME DISAPPOINTMENT SOME FRUSTRATED ATTEMPT WHICH COULD HAVE MADE HIM RENOUNCE THE ROAD OF PRIVATE AMBITION
AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY AND CAUTIOUSLY ELUDED THE FIRST VIOLENCE OF THE TEMPEST HE WOULD IN THE END CERTAINLY PREVAIL AND BE ABLE AT LEAST TO PRESERVE THE ANCIENT LAWS AND CONSTITUTION
HOPE FOR BENDING OF THE SAME

PEACE TOO INDUSTRY COMMERCE OPULENCE
THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE
BUT HOW TO BRING OVER THE SOLDIERS TO THE SAME WAY OF THINKING WAS THE QUESTION
AND HE BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN HOPES OF PROTECTION FROM THE SCOTS
THE KING NAMED WINDSOR AND DESIRED THAT THEIR GARRISON MIGHT BE REMOVED AND HIS OWN TROOPS ADMITTED INTO THAT CASTLE MEANWHILE ESSEX ADVANCING BY HASTY MARCHES HAD ARRIVED AT LONDON
ONE THREATENING THE PEOPLE WITH DAMNATION AND ETERNAL TORMENTS THE OTHER WITH IMPRISONMENT BANISHMENT AND MILITARY EXECUTION
HE WAS RESOLVED TO CONCERT MEASURES WITH THE FRENCH COURT FOR THE FINAL CONQUEST AND PARTITION OF THE LOW COUNTRIES HAD HE LIVED MUCH LONGER AND MAINTAINED HIS AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND SO CHIMERICAL OR RATHER SO DANGEROUS A PROJECT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN CARRIED INTO EXECUTION
THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
AND SUCH POPULAR EXAGGERATIONS ARE AT LEAST A PROOF OF POPULAR DISCONTENTS
THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE
WHO BY THE BEST COLORED PRETENCES AND BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OPEN SINCERITY AND A SCRUPULOUS CONSCIENCE IMPOSED ON THE EASY NATURE OF THIS BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS MAN

BUT THERE WAS A NECESSITY IN ORDER TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND GOOD OF THE NATION
THE PULPITS BEING CHIEFLY FILLED WITH PRESBYTERIANS OR DISGUISED ROYALISTS AND HAVING LONG BEEN THE SCENE OF NEWS AND POLITICS COULD BY NO PENALTIES BE RESTRAINED FROM DECLARATIONS UNFAVORABLE TO THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES WHICH ABOLISHED MONOPOLIES HAD LEFT AN EQUITABLE EXCEPTION IN FAVOR OF NEW INVENTIONS
AND THAT INSTEAD OF A TYRANT AND OPPRESSOR HE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS THE FIRST PATRIOT IN THE NATION
PART OF IT BESIEGED CARLISLE VALIANTLY DEFENDED BY SIR THOMAS GLENHAM
WE HUMBLY PRESENT THIS PETITION TO YOUR MAJESTY NOT ONLY WITH A CARE OF PRESERVING OUR OWN LIBERTIES BUT WITH DUE REGARD TO LEAVE ENTIRE THAT SOVEREIGN POWER WITH WHICH YOUR MAJESTY IS INTRUSTED FOR THE PROTECTION SAFETY AND HAPPINESS OF YOUR PEOPLE LESS PENETRATION THAN WAS POSSESSED BY THE LEADERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS COULD EASILY DISCOVER HOW CAPTIOUS THIS CLAUSE WAS AND HOW MUCH IT WAS CALCULATED TO ELUDE THE WHOLE FORCE OF THE PETITION
THE LOWEST WAS THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND
AND SUCH A STEP IN THEM WAS UNEXPECTED
AND THE KING EMPLOYING GENERAL EXPRESSIONS HAD APPROVED OF THIS INCLINATION AS PIOUS AND NO SOONER WAS THERE AN APPEARANCE OF A RUPTURE THAN THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO ALLURE THAT NATION INTO A CLOSE CONFEDERACY OPENLY DECLARED THEIR WISHES OF ECCLESIASTICAL REFORMATION AND OF IMITATING THE EXAMPLE OF THEIR NORTHERN BRETHREN WHEN WAR WAS ACTUALLY COMMENCED THE SAME ARTIFICES WERE USED AND THE SCOTS BEHELD WITH THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE A SCENE OF ACTION OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT DEEM THEMSELVES INDIFFERENT SPECTATORS
NONE OF THE ANCIENT PEERS HOWEVER THOUGH SUMMONED BY WRIT WOULD DEIGN TO ACCEPT OF A SEAT WHICH THEY MUST SHARE WITH SUCH COMPANIONS AS WERE ASSIGNED THEM
AND AS THE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN HELD TOGETHER SOLELY BY MERCENARY VIEWS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT GREAT TROUBLE AND EXPENSE AND LOSS OF TIME AGAIN TO ASSEMBLE THEM
AND THAT PRELATE BY HIS INDISCRETION AND INSOLENCE SOON MADE THEM REPENT OF THE POWER WITH WHICH THEY HAD INTRUSTED HIM
THE COMMISSIONERS WERE ALSO EMPOWERED TO PRESS THE KING ON THE ARTICLE OF RELIGION AND TO RECOMMEND TO HIM THE SCOTTISH MODEL OF ECCLESIASTIC WORSHIP AND DISCIPLINE
CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS
AND REGARD HIS CONDUCT AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF YORK AS DEPUTY OR LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND AND AS COUNSELLOR OR COMMANDER IN ENGLAND
MONK WITH HIS ARMY TOOK QUARTERS IN WESTMINSTER
THOUGH THE NOISE OF WORKMEN EMPLOYED IN FRAMING THE SCAFFOLD AND OTHER PREPARATIONS FOR HIS EXECUTION CONTINUALLY RESOUNDED IN HIS EARS BURNET'S HISTORY OF HIS OWN TIMES
SENSIBLE OF SOME ENCROACHMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE BY ROYAL AUTHORITY MEN ENTERTAINED NO JEALOUSY OF THE COMMONS WHOSE ENTERPRISES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF POWER HAD EVER BEEN COVERED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF PUBLIC GOOD AND HAD HITHERTO GONE NO FURTHER THAN SOME DISAPPOINTED EFFORTS AND ENDEAVORS
AND THOUGH PARITY MAY SEEM AT FIRST TO HAVE HAD PLACE AMONG CHRISTIAN PASTORS THE PERIOD DURING WHICH IT PREVAILED WAS SO SHORT THAT FEW UNDISPUTED TRACES OF IT REMAINED IN HISTORY
THEY HAD SECRETLY CONCURRED IN ALL ENCROACHMENTS OF THE MILITARY UPON THE CIVIL POWER

HE WAS OBLIGED TO SUMMON A PARLIAMENT EVERY THREE YEARS AND ALLOW THEM TO SIT FIVE MONTHS WITHOUT ADJOURNMENT PROROGATION OR DISSOLUTION
51 52 57
AFTER THE CESSATION THERE WAS LITTLE NECESSITY AS WELL AS NO MEANS OF SUBSISTING THE ARMY IN IRELAND
A NEW ABSURDITY
WHERE HE LAY CONCEALED IN THE BORDERS OF THE HIGHLANDS AND SECRETLY PREPARED THE MINDS OF HIS PARTISANS FOR ATTEMPTING SOME GREAT ENTERPRISE CLARENDON VOL
THE EXAMPLE OF HENRY VIII WHO HAD ONCE IN HIS ARBITRARY REIGN PRACTICED A LIKE METHOD OF LEVYING A REGULAR SUPPLY WAS GENERALLY DEEMED A VERY INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
NEXT THEY MUST HAVE A VINDICATION OF THEIR CHARACTER
THOUGH IT BE COMMONLY EASY IN CIVIL WARS TO GET INTELLIGENCE THE ARMIES WERE WITHIN SIX MILES OF EACH OTHER ERE EITHER OF THE GENERALS WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE APPROACH OF HIS ENEMY
HE EVEN SECRETLY RETAINED AN INTENTION OF SEIZING FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO
THE KING AS HE HAD NEITHER MONEY ARMS AMMUNITION NOR PROVISIONS TO SPARE FROM HIS OWN URGENT WANTS RESOLVED TO EMBRACE AN EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT AT ONCE RELIEVE THE NECESSITIES OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND
LETTERS OF REPRISAL WERE GRANTED TO SEVERAL MERCHANTS WHO COMPLAINED OF INJURIES WHICH THEY PRETENDED THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE STATES
THE EXPERIENCE OF PAST DISTRACTIONS THE DREAD OF FUTURE CONVULSIONS THE INDIGNATION AGAINST MILITARY USURPATION AGAINST SANCTIFIED HYPOCRISY
AND THIS PROBABLY WAS THE UTMOST OF THAT EMBRYO SCHEME WHICH WAS FORMED WITH REGARD TO THE ARMY
HE FAIRLY TOLD THEM IN HIS FIRST SPEECH THAT IF THEY SHOULD NOT DO THEIR DUTIES IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE NECESSITIES OF THE STATE HE MUST IN DISCHARGE OF HIS CONSCIENCE USE THOSE OTHER MEANS WHICH GOD HAD PUT INTO HIS HANDS IN ORDER TO SAVE THAT WHICH THE FOLLIES OF SOME PARTICULAR MEN MAY OTHERWISE PUT IN DANGER
AND IF THE INSTRUMENTS WHOM HE HAD HITHERTO EMPLOYED WERE NOT WORTHY TO BRING TO A CONCLUSION SO GLORIOUS A DESIGN THAT HE WOULD INSPIRE OTHERS MORE FIT WHO MIGHT PERFECT WHAT WAS BEGUN AND BY ESTABLISHING TRUE RELIGION PUT A SPEEDY PERIOD TO THE PUBLIC MISERIES
AND HAVING ALREADY IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY ANNIHILATED BOTH EPISCOPACY AND REGAL AUTHORITY HAD NO FURTHER CONCESSIONS TO EXACT FROM HIM
WHEN SHE SPOKE OF CHRIST SHE USUALLY GAVE HIM THE NAME OF THE COVENANTING JESUS
THE EARL OF NORWICH AND SIR JOHN OWEN BEING CONDEMNED BY THE SAME COURT WERE PARDONED BY THE COMMONS
THEY APPOINTED COMMISSIONERS FOR ASSIGNING QUARTERS TO THE ARMY
GREAT REJOICINGS WERE EXPRESSED BOTH IN THE CITY AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION

SO GREAT IS THE ASCENDANT WHICH FROM A LONG COURSE OF SUCCESSES THE ENGLISH HAS ACQUIRED OVER THE IRISH NATION THAT THOUGH THE LATTER WHEN THEY RECEIVE MILITARY DISCIPLINE AMONG FOREIGNERS ARE NOT SURPASSED BY ANY TROOPS THEY HAVE NEVER IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ANY VIGOROUS EFFORT FOR THE DEFENCE OR RECOVERY OF THEIR LIBERTIES

WE HAVE LIVED MY LORDS HAPPILY TO OURSELVES AT HOME
AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE MAGISTRATES WERE ABLE PARTLY BY AUTHORITY PARTLY BY FORCE TO EXPEL THE RABBLE AND TO SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST THEM
THE HEIGHT OF ALL INIQUITY AND FANATICAL EXTRAVAGANCE YET REMAINED--THE PUBLIC TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
FIVE HUNDRED EXCELLENT SOLDIERS PERISHED
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY BROKE OUT IN THE MOST VIOLENT DISORDER
THURLOE HIS SECRETARY HAD SPIES EVERY WHERE
HE BETOOK HIMSELF IN EARLY YOUTH TO THE PROFESSION OF ARMS
THAT GREATER CONFIDENCE MIGHT SAFELY BE REPOSED IN MEN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE THAN IN MERE ADVENTURERS WHO WOULD BE APT TO ENTERTAIN SEPARATE VIEWS FROM THOSE WHICH WERE EMBRACED BY THE PERSONS WHO EMPLOYED THEM
HE BOUGHT HOWEVER HIS VICTORY WITH THE LOSS OF HIS LIFE
BUT THERE STILL REMAINS ENOUGH TO PROVE THAT THE MIND OF THE DEPUTY THOUGH GREAT AND FIRM HAD BEEN NOT A LITTLE DEBAUCHED BY THE RIOT OF ABSOLUTE POWER AND UNCONTROLLED AUTHORITY
AT HIS RECOMMENDATION HE HAD MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF THE FAMOUS HAMBDEN WHO DURING HIS LIFETIME HAD BEEN AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF CROMWELL'S AND WHOSE MEMORY WAS EVER RESPECTED BY HIM
BUT THE MINISTERS THOUGHT THAT THE SAME EVENTS WHICH TO THEIR ENEMIES WERE JUDGMENTS TO THEM WERE TRIALS AND THEY REPLIED THAT THE LORD HAD ONLY HID HIS FACE FOR A TIME FROM JACOB
THE SEQUESTRATIONS AND COMPOSITIONS OF THE ROYALISTS THE SALE OF THE CROWN LANDS AND OF THE DEAN AND CHAPTER LANDS THOUGH THEY YIELDED GREAT SUMS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE VAST EXPENSES AND AS WAS SUSPECTED THE GREAT DEPREDATIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND OF THEIR CREATURES HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY PART II
THIS MAN THE MOST TURBULENT BUT THE MOST UPRIGHT AND COURAGEOUS OF HUMAN KIND WAS TRIED FOR A TRANSGRESSION OF THE NEW STATUTE OF TREASONS
WE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD LONG CONTINUE THOUGH THE BOUNDARIES OF AUTHORITY IN THEIR SEVERAL BRANCHES BE IMPLICIT CONFUSED AND UNDETERMINED
THE ENGLISH OF THE PALE WHO PROBABLY WERE NOT AT FIRST IN THE SECRET PRETENDED TO BLAME THE INSURRECTION AND TO DETEST THE BARBARITY WITH WHICH IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PROTESTATIONS AND DECLARATIONS THEY ENGAGED THE JUSTICES TO SUPPLY THEM WITH ARMS WHICH THEY PROMISED TO EMPLOY IN DEFENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT IN A LITTLE TIME THE INTERESTS OF RELIGION WERE FOUND MORE PREVALENT OVER THEM THAN REGARD AND DUTY TO THEIR MOTHER COUNTRY
AFTER THIS THE PARLIAMENT ADJOURNED TO THE TWENTIETH OF OCTOBER
THOUGH REBELLIOUS SUBJECTS HAD FREQUENTLY IN THE OPEN FIELD RESISTED THE KING'S AUTHORITY NO PERSON HAD BEEN FOUND SO BOLD WHILE CONFINED AND AT MERCY AS TO SET HIMSELF IN OPPOSITION TO REGAL POWER AND TO CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST THE WILL OF THE SOVEREIGN
THE MONEY LEVIED OR RATHER EXTORTED UNDER COLOR OF PREROGATIVE HAD COME IN VERY SLOWLY AND HAD LEFT SUCH ILL HUMOR IN THE NATION THAT IT APPEARED DANGEROUS TO RENEW THE EXPERIMENT

THEY EXPRESS THEIR ABHORRENCE OF THE LATE CONSPIRACY
HIS ILLUSIONS DISSIPATED
BUT IN THE PRESENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEIR CAUSE ALL SCRUPLES WERE LAID ASIDE
IN THE INFERIOR COURTS THE MIXTURE OF THE LAITY MIGHT SERVE RATHER TO TEMPER THE USUAL ZEAL OF THE CLERGY BUT THOUGH THE PRESBYTERIANS BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PARITY AMONG THE ECCLESIASTICS WERE SO FAR GRATIFIED THEY WERE DENIED SATISFACTION IN SEVERAL OTHER POINTS ON WHICH THEY WERE EXTREMELY INTENT

THE ROYALISTS TOO HAD MANY OF THEM BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE CONCEALMENTS IN THEIR HOUSES FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FRIENDS OR MORE VALUABLE EFFECTS
OR SHOULD IT BE FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTRAIN THE LICENSE OF HUMAN DISQUISITIONS IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DOCTRINE OF OBEDIENCE OUGHT ALONE TO BE INCULCATED
WHEN MONTROSE DESCENDED INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES THE COVENANTERS ASSEMBLING THEIR WHOLE FORCE MET HIM WITH A NUMEROUS ARMY AND GAVE HIM BATTLE BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AT KILSYTH THIS WAS THE MOST COMPLETE VICTORY THAT MONTROSE EVER OBTAINED
THE ENGLISH DIVINES WENT AWAY FULL OF ADMIRATION AT THE BLIND ASSURANCE AND BIGOTED PREJUDICES OF THE MAN
IN THE HURRY OF REVENGE THEY HAD INSTANTLY BEEN PUT TO DEATH HAD THEY NOT BEEN SAVED BY SOME OF MORE TEMPER AND JUDGMENT WHO THOUGH THEY HAD THE SAME OPINION OF THEIR GUILT THOUGHT PROPER TO RESERVE THEM FOR A JUDICIAL TRIAL AND EXAMINATION
AND ON THE OTHER HAND SO PRECARIOUS AND TEMPORARY FROM THE FRAILTY OF HUMAN NATURE IS THE OPERATION OF THESE SPIRITUAL VIEWS THAT THE RELIGIOUS ECSTASIES IF CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED MUST OFTEN BE COUNTERFEIT AND MUST BE WARPED BY THOSE MORE FAMILIAR MOTIVES OF INTEREST AND AMBITION WHICH INSENSIBLY GAIN UPON THE MIND
LINGERING EXPEDIENTS ALONE WILL BE PURSUED
A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR HIS BEING EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS TO THE COMMONS
THE PRINCE'S TRAIN OF ARTILLERY WAS TAKEN

BECAUSE THEY SAID THIS INCORPORATING UNION WOULD DRAW ALONG WITH IT A SUBORDINATION OF THE CHURCH TO THE STATE IN THE THINGS OF CHRIST ENGLISH JUDGES JOINED TO SOME SCOTTISH WERE APPOINTED TO DETERMINE ALL CAUSES
A PARTY SENT TO SUPPRESS THEM WAS PERSUADED BY THEIR COMMANDER TO JOIN IN THE SAME DECLARATION
ON EVERY SIDE THIS UNFORTUNATE PRINCE WAS PURSUED WITH MURMURS DISCONTENT FACTION AND CIVIL WARS AND THE FIRE FROM ALL QUARTERS EVEN BY THE MOST INDEPENDENT ACCIDENTS AT ONCE BLAZED UP ABOUT HIM

THE BISHOP OF ROSS ASPIRED TO THE OFFICE OF TREASURER
AND SO HE SAITH IN HIS INDEX
AND WHERE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE THERE IS A KIND OF OMNIPOTENCY
THAT THE COMMONS WERE ONLY ACCUSERS NOT JUDGES
AND BEING SEATED IN HIS CHAIR OF STATE THE PETITION WAS READ TO HIM
AND ALL MEN CAST THEIR EYES ON SO PIOUS AND SO SUCCESSFUL A LEADER
AFTER MANY DISCUSSIONS IT WAS AT LAST AGREED THAT IN LIEU OF ALL DEMANDS THEY SHOULD ACCEPT OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS ONE HALF TO BE PAID INSTANTLY ANOTHER IN TWO SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS RUSH VOL
TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
EMP OF GERM
THE SPEAKERS OF THE TWO HOUSES MANCHESTER AND LENTHAL ATTENDED BY EIGHT PEERS AND ABOUT SIXTY COMMONERS HAVING SECRETLY RETIRED FROM THE CITY PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR MACES AND ALL THE ENSIGNS OF THEIR DIGNITY
THE NATION FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR RELAXATION OR DIVERSION
BUT BELIEVE THAT I SHALL BE OUT OF IT ERE NIGHT THIS EXCELLENT PERSON WAS BUT THIRTY-FOUR YEARS OF AGE WHEN A PERIOD WAS THUS PUT TO HIS LIFE
DURING THE TIME THAT THE KING REMAINED IN THE SCOTTISH ARMY AT NEWCASTLE DIED THE EARL OF ESSEX THE DISCARDED BUT STILL POWERFUL AND POPULAR GENERAL OF THE PARLIAMENT
WHILE THE PURITANICAL SECTARIES WHO FIND THAT THE LATTER METHOD OF ADDRESS BEING DIRECTED TO A NUMEROUS AUDIENCE PRESENT AND VISIBLE IS MORE INFLAMING AND ANIMATING HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED IT AS THE CHIEF PART OF DIVINE SERVICE

STRAFFORD SENSIBLE OF THE LOAD OF POPULAR PREJUDICES UNDER WHICH HE LABORED WOULD GLADLY HAVE DECLINED ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT

THE COMMONS RETURNED IN VERY ILL HUMOR
THE FREQUENT TUMULTS WHICH THESE FACTIOUS MALECONTENTS HAD EXCITED AND WHICH ENDANGERED THE LIBERTY OF PARLIAMENT
IT WAS THAT WHICH HE MET WITH IN HIS OWN FAMILY AND FROM MEN WHO BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION WERE THE MOST DEVOTED TO HIM
30

I MUST TELL YOU IT IS ABOLISHED
HIS POWER AND AMBITION WERE TOO GREAT TO BROOK SUBMISSION TO THE EMPTY NAME OF A REPUBLIC WHICH STOOD CHIEFLY BY HIS INFLUENCE AND WAS SUPPORTED BY HIS VICTORIES
AND THE PARLIAMENT RATHER THAN HAVE RECOURSE TO THE PLEA OF NECESSITY AND AVOW THE TRANSGRESSION OF ANY STATUTE HAD ALSO BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WARP THE LAWS AND BY FORCED CONSTRUCTIONS TO INTERPRET THEM IN THEIR OWN FAVOR CLARERDON VOL

JESUS CHRIST IS OWNED THIS DAY BY YOUR CALL AND YOU OWN HIM BY YOUR WILLINGNESS TO APPEAR FOR HIM AND YOU MANIFEST THIS AS FAR AS POOR CREATURES CAN DO TO BE A DAY OF THE POWER OF CHRIST
THE MARQUIS ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE HIM THAT HAVING SO SUCCESSFULLY EFFECTED HIS PURPOSE HE OUGHT TO BE CONTENT WITH THE PRESENT ADVANTAGES AND LEAVE THE ENEMY NOW MUCH DIMINISHED BY THEIR LOSSES AND DISCOURAGED BY THEIR ILL SUCCESS TO DISSOLVE BY THOSE MUTUAL DISSENSIONS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO TAKE PLACE AMONG THEM THE PRINCE WHOSE MARTIAL DISPOSITION WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY TEMPERED WITH PRUDENCE NOR SOFTENED BY COMPLAISANCE PRETENDING POSITIVE ORDERS FROM THE KING WITHOUT DEIGNING TO CONSULT WITH NEWCASTLE WHOSE MERITS AND SERVICES DESERVED BETTER TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BATTLE AND LED OUT THE ARMY TO MARSTON MOOR THIS ACTION WAS OBSTINATELY DISPUTED BETWEEN THE MOST NUMEROUS ARMIES THAT WERE ENGAGED DURING THE COURSE OF THESE WARS
THE KING'S GREAT AIM WAS TO COMPLETE THE WORK SO HAPPILY BEGUN BY HIS FATHER
THE QUEEN TERRIFIED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH EVERY WAY ENVIRONED HER AND AFRAID OF BEING ENCLOSED IN OXFORD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KINGDOM FLED TO EXETER WHERE SHE HOPED TO BE DELIVERED UNMOLESTED OF THE CHILD WITH WHICH SHE WAS NOW PREGNANT AND WHENCE SHE HAD THE MEANS OF AN EASY ESCAPE INTO FRANCE IF PRESSED BY THE FORCES OF THE ENEMY
MEANWHILE IF THIS EMERGENCE AND THE GREAT NECESSITY TO WHICH I AM DRIVEN BEGET ANY VIOLATION OF LAW I HOPE IT SHALL BE IMPUTED BY GOD AND MAN TO THE AUTHORS OF THIS WAR
AS TO THE MILITIA I THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT BEFORE I GAVE THAT ANSWER AND AM SO MUCH ASSURED THAT THE ANSWER IS AGREEABLE TO WHAT IN JUSTICE OR REASON YOU CAN ASK OR I IN HONOR GRANT THAT I SHALL NOT ALTER IT IN ANY POINT
AND EVEN INSINUATES THAT IF HE HAD THOUGHT PROPER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN JERSEY OR ANY OTHER PLACE OF SAFETY 18 PAGE 79 80 ETC
BUT THIS IMPARTIALITY WOULD HAVE DISAPPOINTED ALL THE VIEWS OF THOSE WHO HAD INTRODUCED THE SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE
THE REGIMENT WAS BROKEN
HIS BODY STRONG HEALTHY AND JUSTLY PROPORTIONED
AND NOTHING BESIDES COULD AFFORD MORE SUBJECT OF RIDICULE THAN AN OATH WHICH CONTAINED AN ET CAETERA IN THE MIDST OF IT
WHO ARRIVING BEFORE ROCHELLE MADE SOME ATTEMPTS TO BREAK THROUGH THE MOLE AND FORCE HIS WAY INTO THE HARBOR
DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN THE ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT MET WITH SUCH HONOR AND ENCOURAGEMENT AND WAS THE IMMEDIATE MEANS OF DISTINCTION AND PREFERMENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET BOUNDS TO THESE HOLY FERVORS OR CONFINE WITHIN ANY NATURAL LIMITS WHAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INFINITE AND A SUPERNATURAL OBJECT
LEARNING ITSELF WHICH TENDS SO MUCH TO ENLARGE THE MIND AND HUMANIZE THE TEMPER RATHER SERVED ON THIS OCCASION TO EXALT THAT EPIDEMICAL FRENZY WHICH PREVAILED
AND IT WAS ONE CHIEF MOTIVE FOR HIS DESIRING THE TITLE OF KING THAT HE MIGHT REPLACE EVERY THING IN ITS NATURAL ORDER AND RESTORE TO THE ANCIENT FAMILIES THE TRUST AND HONOR OF WHICH HE NOW FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED FOR HIS OWN SAFETY TO DEPRIVE THEM
IT HAS SINCE BEEN THE MAXIM OF PRINCES WHEREVER POPULAR LEADERS ENCROACH TOO MUCH ON ROYAL AUTHORITY TO CONFER OFFICES ON THEM IN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL AFTERWARDS BECOME MORE CAREFUL NOT TO DIMINISH THAT POWER WHICH HAS BECOME THEIR OWN
AND IF THEY SHOULD REFUSE IT ON THEIR PART ESPECIALLY WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH OUTRAGE AND INDIGNITY WHAT COULD BE EXPECTED BUT A TOTAL DISSOLUTION OF GOVERNMENT AND VIOLENT FACTIONS FOLLOWED BY THE MOST DANGEROUS CONVULSIONS AND INTESTINE DISORDERS
THE STATES GENERAL SENT DEPUTIES WITH A LIKE FRIENDLY INVITATION
BY NORTHUMBERLAND'S SICKNESS THE COMMAND OF THE ARMY HAD DEVOLVED ON STRAFFORD
FACTIONS ARISE ON EVERY SIDE AND THREATEN THE TRANQUILLITY OF YOUR NATIVE COUNTRY
THE SCOTS FIRST ENTREATED THEM WITH GREAT CIVILITY NOT TO STOP THEM IN THEIR MARCH TO THEIR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN
TO THE GREAT SCANDAL OF THE PURITANS WHO WERE OFFENDED AT SEEING THE KING ON SUCH GOOD TERMS WITH THE PAPISTS AND REPINED THAT OTHERS SHOULD GIVE WHAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE DISPOSED TO REFUSE HIM
THE PARLIAMENT CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DECAY IN POPULARITY SEEING A FORMIDABLE ARMED FORCE ADVANCE UPON THEM WERE REDUCED TO DESPAIR AND FOUND ALL THEIR RESOURCES MUCH INFERIOR TO THE PRESENT NECESSITY
HARVEY IS ENTITLED TO THE GLORY OF HAVING MADE BY REASONING ALONE WITHOUT ANY MIXTURE OF ACCIDENT A CAPITAL DISCOVERY IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF SCIENCE
HE CAME THEREFORE TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS AND PRONOUNCING THE USUAL FORM OF WORDS LET IT BE LAW AS IS DESIRED GAVE FULL SANCTION AND AUTHORITY TO THE PETITION
MARY PRINCESS OF ORANGE BORN 1631
THE REASON SAYS HE WHY WE WOULD HAVE CLOSED WITH THE KING WAS THIS
IT IS EASY TO SEE IN WHAT AN INEXTRICABLE LABYRINTH CHARLES WAS NOW INVOLVED
IF NO OTHER METHOD OF CONVICTION HAD BEEN DEVISED DURING THIS ILLEGAL AND UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT ALL ITS ENEMIES WERE ASSURED OF ENTIRE IMPUNITY
WHEN HE REFUSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE KING'S COMMAND TO PUT THE QUESTION
THE WHOLE SQUADRON SAILED IMMEDIATELY TO THE DOWNS
THOUGH EXCEPT THE TAKING OF BANBURY A FEW DAYS AFTER HE HAD FEW MARKS OF VICTORY TO BOAST OF
MORE CONCISE THAN HOMER MORE SIMPLE THAN TASSO MORE NERVOUS THAN LUCRETIUS HAD HE LIVED IN A LATER AGE AND LEARNED TO POLISH SOME RUDENESS IN HIS VERSES
359
HENCE CROMWELL IN THE INVECTIVES OF THAT AGE IS OFTEN STIGMATIZED WITH THE NAME OF THE BREWER
AND HE WAS DETERMINED AS HE WROTE TO LORD DIGBY IF HE COULD NOT LIVE AS A KING TO DIE LIKE A GENTLEMAN
IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THE EXTREME DISTRESS OF HIS PARTY CONSISTED THE PRESENT SAFETY OF THE KING
THOUGH WAR WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A NAVAL POWER AS THE DUTCH WHO WERE IN PEACE WITH ALL THEIR OTHER NEIGHBORS MIGHT SEEM DANGEROUS TO THE YET UNSETTLED COMMONWEALTH THERE WERE SEVERAL MOTIVES WHICH AT THIS TIME INDUCED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO EMBRACE HOSTILE MEASURES
AND IN THAT SULLEN AGE WHEN THE IRREGULARITIES OF PLEASURE WERE MORE REPROACHFUL THAN THE MOST ODIOUS CRIMES THESE WEAKNESSES WERE THOUGHT WORTHY OF BEING MENTIONED TOGETHER WITH HIS TREASONS BEFORE SO GREAT AN ASSEMBLY
AND HE SHOWED TO HIS FRIENDS HIS BROKEN AND DISHEARTENED FORCES WHICH A FEW MONTHS BEFORE HE HAD LED INTO THE FIELD IN SO FLOURISHING A CONDITION
THE CHIEF OPPOSITION CAME FROM THE USUAL ADHERENTS OF THE PROTECTOR THE MAJOR-GENERALS AND SUCH OFFICERS AS DEPENDED ON THEM
SEVERAL OF THE COVENANTERS WERE ALSO SWORN OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
228
THE ARMY SUSPECTED THAT THIS DEFICIENCY WAS PURPOSELY CONTRIVED IN ORDER TO OBLIGE THEM TO LIVE AT FREE QUARTERS
THE COMMISSIONERS REPLIED THAT HE MUST GIVE HIS ANSWER IN TEN DAYS HE DESIRED TO REASON ABOUT THE MEANING AND IMPORT OF SOME TERMS
HAVING THE WAY OPEN HE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY TO MARCH INTO ENGLAND WHERE HE EXPECTED THAT ALL HIS FRIENDS AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT WOULD FLOCK TO HIS STANDARD
AND HE THOUGHT HIMSELF BOUND BY MORE SACRED TIES THAN THOSE OF POLICY OR EVEN OF HONOR TO THE SUPPORT OF THAT ORDER
TO OFFEND A WHOLE NATION UNDER THE VIEW OF PUNISHMENT
THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FACE OF THE ARMY TO CLOSE THEIR TREATY WITH THE KING
THIS ACQUISITION WAS REGARDED BY THE PROTECTOR AS THE MEANS ONLY OF OBTAINING FURTHER ADVANTAGES

THIS MAN MY LORDS SAID SERJEANT WILDE CONCLUDING HIS LONG SPEECH AGAINST HIM IS LIKE NAAMAN THE SYRIAN
BUT FAIRFAX MADE FIVE HUNDRED OFFICERS PRISONERS AND FOUR THOUSAND PRIVATE MEN
IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SUMMER A COMBINATION FORMED AGAINST THEM IN LONDON HAD OBLIGED THEM TO EXERT THE PLENITUDE OF THEIR AUTHORITY
A BODY OF HORSE WAS ORDERED TO BE INSTANTLY LEVIED
THE PEOPLE IN THEIR RAGE HAD TOTALLY MISTAKEN THE PROPER OBJECT OF THEIR RESENTMENT
AND BEING A ZEALOUS PARLIAMENTARIAN HIS AUTHORITY IS VERY CONSIDERABLE NOTWITHSTANDING THE AIR OF SATIRE WHICH PREVAILS IN HIS WRITINGS
WITH REGARD TO THE BILL FOR TRIENNIAL PARLIAMENTS HE MADE A LITTLE DIFFICULTY
THE SECLUDED MEMBERS UPON THE GENERAL'S INVITATION WENT TO THE HOUSE AND FINDING NO LONGER ANY OBSTRUCTION THEY ENTERED AND IMMEDIATELY APPEARED TO BE THE MAJORITY
THEIR WHOLE COMMERCE BY THE CHANNEL WAS CUT OFF
LITTLETON SOLICITOR-GENERAL
AND IN EVERY CONTROVERSY BETWEEN PRINCE AND PEOPLE THE QUESTION HOWEVER DOUBTFUL HAD ALWAYS BEEN DECIDED BY EACH PARTY IN FAVOR OF ITS OWN PRETENSIONS
A FLEET WAS PUT UNDER HIS COMMAND AND HE RECEIVED ORDERS TO PURSUE PRINCE RUPERT TO WHOM THE KING HAD INTRUSTED THAT SQUADRON WHICH HAD DESERTED TO HIM
130
O'NEALE HIMSELF CONFESSED THE IMPOSTURE ON HIS TRIAL AND AT HIS EXECUTION
BECAUSE NOT RATIFIED BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT IN WHOM ALL AUTHORITY WAS NOW SUPPOSED TO BE CENTRED
AND SHE BEGGED A PRIVATE ROOM FOR HIM WHERE HE MIGHT BE QUIET
BUT ALL MILITARY GOVERNMENT IS PRECARIOUS
YET OF THESE NINETEEN HAD THE COURAGE TO VOTE AGAINST IT;[V A CERTAIN PROOF THAT IF ENTIRE FREEDOM HAD BEEN ALLOWED THE BILL HAD BEEN REJECTED BY A GREAT MAJORITY
NELSON VOL
AND THE OPPOSITE LAWYERS DO NOT DENY IT
THE POLICY PURSUED BY THE COMMONS AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO SUCCEEDED TO ADMIRATION WAS TO ASTONISH THE KING BY THE BOLDNESS OF THEIR ENTERPRISES TO INTERMINGLE NO SWEETNESS WITH THEIR SEVERITY TO EMPLOY EXPRESSIONS NO LESS VIOLENT THAN THEIR PRETENSIONS AND TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE IN WHAT LITTLE ESTIMATION THEY HELD BOTH HIS PERSON AND HIS DIGNITY
HE WAS BOUND WITH A CORD DRAWN OVER HIS BREAST AND SHOULDERS AND FASTENED THROUGH HOLES MADE IN THE CART
90
AND THE LOWER HOUSE WAS FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE GENERAL DECLARATIONS SIGNIFIED NOTHING AND THAT THE LATTER CLAUSE LEFT THEIR LIBERTIES RATHER IN A WORSE CONDITION THAN BEFORE
V BATES
SUCH HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THOSE STATUTES ENACTED DURING TURBULENT TIMES IN ORDER TO LIMIT ROYAL PREROGATIVE AND CRAMP THE SOVEREIGN IN HIS PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC AND HIS EXECUTION OF THE LAWS
HIS SOVEREIGN HIMSELF HE HELD IN SUBJECTION WHILE HE EXALTED THE THRONE
AND IT PLAINLY APPEARS FROM THIS INCIDENT AS WELL AS FROM MANY OTHERS THAT OF ALL EUROPEAN NATIONS THE BRITISH WERE AT THAT TIME AND TILL LONG AFTER THE MOST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THAT RELIGIOUS SPIRIT WHICH TENDS RATHER TO INFLAME BIGOTRY THAN INCREASE PEACE AND MUTUAL CHARITY
IT MUST ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PROTECTOR IN HIS CIVIL AND DOMESTIC ADMINISTRATION DISPLAYED AS GREAT REGARD BOTH TO JUSTICE AND CLEMENCY AS HIS USURPED AUTHORITY DERIVED FROM NO LAW AND FOUNDED ONLY ON THE SWORD COULD POSSIBLY PERMIT
ALMOST EVERY ADVANTAGE LAY AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE
524 525
PHILIP BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER MARY THERESE ALONG WITH HIM
THE BROTHERS EMBRACE
ON ACCOUNT OF THESE WERE THE POPULAR LEADERS CONTENT TO THROW THE GOVERNMENT INTO SUCH VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
THEY WERE ROYALISTS AND REFUSED TO PLEAD BEFORE SO ILLEGAL A JURISDICTION
BE HUMBLY AND DAILY PETITIONED THAT HE WOULD BE PLEASED AT THE RATE OF MILLIONS A YEAR TO BE HIRED AS MASTER OF THOSE WHO HAD HIRED HIM BEFORE TO BE THEIR SERVANT
HE MADE WARM PROTESTATIONS OF SINCERITY IN THE REFORMED RELIGION
WHILE THIS AFFAIR WAS IN AGITATION AND LISTS WERE MAKING OF SUCH AS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE WELL AFFECTED TO THEIR DESIGN A SERVANT OF TOMKINS WHO HAD OVERHEARD THEIR DISCOURSE IMMEDIATELY CARRIED INTELLIGENCE TO PYM
BUT ABBOT WAS LITTLE ATTACHED TO THE COURT AND WAS ALSO A PURITAN IN DOCTRINE AND BORE A MORTAL HATRED TO THE PAPISTS
AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SO REASONABLE A DOCTRINE OWED ITS ORIGIN NOT TO REASONING BUT TO THE HEIGHT OF EXTRAVAGANCE AND FANATICISM
1653 GREAT PREPARATIONS WERE MADE IN ENGLAND IN ORDER TO WIPE OFF THIS DISGRACE
THE SCOTS IN THE NORTH ENRAGED AS WELL AS THEIR OTHER COUNTRYMEN AGAINST THE USURPATIONS OF THE SECTARIAN ARMY PROFESSED THEIR ADHERENCE TO THE KING
AND BY MUTUAL ALTERCATION AND OPPOSITION THE BREACH BECAME STILL WIDER BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE COMMONWEALTH
AND AMONG THE OTHER EVILS ARISING FROM THESE DOMESTIC WARS WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF THAT IMPOST INTO ENGLAND
AND AFTER THAT SHOULD BE ELAPSED RESERVED TO THEMSELVES THE POWER OF RENEWING OR REFUSING THE SAME CONCESSION BUT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WHO SAW THAT THIS DUTY WAS NOW BECOME MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER TO SUPPLY THE GROWING NECESSITIES OF THE CROWN AND WHO DID NOT APPROVE OF THIS ENCROACHING SPIRIT IN THE COMMONS REJECTED THE BILL
THE VIOLENT ENTHUSIASM OF THIS SECT LIKE ALL HIGH PASSIONS BEING TOO STRONG FOR THE WEAK NERVES TO SUSTAIN THREW THE PREACHERS INTO CONVULSIONS AND SHAKINGS AND DISTORTIONS IN THEIR LIMBS
A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL
AND THEIR GREAT INTEREST IN CORNWALL SOON ENABLED THEM TO EFFECT THEIR PURPOSE
THE IGNORANCE OF THE AGE MADE MEN MORE SUBMISSIVE TO THAT AUTHORITY WHICH GOVERNED THEM
WHY SHOULD NOT YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR PRECIOUS SOULS ALWAYS STANDING AT YOUR ELBOW WITH WHOM YOU MIGHT NOW AND THEN TURN INTO A CORNER
HE BESTOWED PENSIONS AND PREFERMENTS ON HENDERSON GILLESPY AND OTHER POPULAR PREACHERS AND PRACTISED EVERY ART TO SOFTEN IF NOT TO GAIN HIS GREATEST ENEMIES
AND A SPEECH WHICH PYM MADE THEM ON THAT SUBJECT WAS MUCH MORE HEARKENED TO THAN THAT WHICH THE LORD KEEPER HAD DELIVERED TO THEM IN THE NAME OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
THE EARL OF GLAMORGAN DOES NO WAY INTEND HEREBY TO OBLIGE HIS MAJESTY OTHER THAN HE HIMSELF SHALL PLEASE AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED THESE TEN THOUSAND MEN AS A PLEDGE AND TESTIMONY OF THE SAID ROMAN CATHOLICS LOYALTY AND FIDELITY TO HIS MAJESTY
WITHIN A FEW DAYS AFTER WAS ADMITTED THE EARL OF WARWICK ALL THESE NOBLEMEN WERE OF THE POPULAR PARTY
WHAT AUTHORITY IS LEFT TO THE GREAT CHARTER TO THE STATUTES AND TO THE VERY PETITION OF RIGHT WHICH IN THE PRESENT REIGN HAD BEEN SO SOLEMNLY ENACTED BY THE CONCURRENCE OF THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
HE COMMITTED THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT IMPORTANT PLACE TO LOCKHART A SCOTCHMAN OF ABILITIES WHO HAD MARRIED HIS NIECE AND WAS HIS AMBASSADOR AT THE COURT OF FRANCE
AND THAT PUBLIC LIBERTY MUST BE SO PRECARIOUS UNDER THIS EXORBITANT PREROGATIVE AS TO RENDER AN OPPOSITION NOT ONLY EXCUSABLE BUT LAUDABLE IN THE PEOPLE 4 SOME LAWS HAD BEEN ENACTED DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY VII AGAINST DEPOPULATION OR THE CONVERTING OF ARABLE LANDS INTO PASTURE
THAT URREY MIGHT HAVE NO LEISURE TO PERCEIVE THE STRATAGEM HE INSTANTLY LED HIS LEFT WING TO THE CHARGE
OF WHICH SOME PARTS ARE OF THEMSELVES THE MOST LOFTY THAT CAN ENTER INTO HUMAN CONCEPTION
385
EVEN IN THE ARTICLES OF PACIFICATION THEY EXPRESSED A DESIRE OF UNIFORMITY IN WORSHIP WITH ENGLAND
FOR THIS CONTEMPT AS IT WAS INTERPRETED HE WAS CONDEMNED TO BE WHIPPED PILLORIED AND IMPRISONED
ON THE OTHER HAND THE LEGISLATIVE POWER WHICH HE RESERVED TO HIMSELF AND COUNCIL TOGETHER WITH SO GREAT AN ARMY INDEPENDENT OF THE PARLIAMENT WERE BAD PROGNOSTICS OF HIS INTENTION TO SUBMIT TO A CIVIL AND LEGAL CONSTITUTION
THOUGH THE PUBLIC NECESSITIES SOMETIMES OBLIGED HIM TO RUN IN ARREARS TO THEM
THE AGITATORS HE SAID HAD RENDERED HIM ODIOUS TO THE ARMY AND HAD REPRESENTED HIM AS A TRAITOR WHO FOR THE SAKE OF PRIVATE INTEREST WAS READY TO BETRAY THE CAUSE OF GOD TO THE GREAT ENEMY OF PIETY AND RELIGION
WHILE FRIENDS FAMILY RELATIONS WHOM HE PASSIONATELY LOVED WERE PLACED AT A DISTANCE AND UNABLE TO SERVE HIM HE REPOSED HIMSELF WITH CONFIDENCE IN THE ARMS OF THAT BEING WHO PENETRATES AND SUSTAINS ALL NATURE AND WHOSE SEVERITIES IF RECEIVED WITH PIETY AND RESIGNATION HE REGARDED AS THE SUREST PLEDGES OF UNEXHAUSTED FAVOR

AMONG THE OTHER EVASIONS OF THE KING WE MAY RECKON THE PROPOSAL OF THE HOUSE OF PEERS TO SUBJOIN TO THE INTENDED PETITION OF RIGHT THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE
THE COMMITTEE WILLINGLY ACCEPTED THIS FALLACIOUS OFFER
IN PROSECUTION OF THESE VIEWS THE PARLIAMENT HAVING HEARD THE PROTECTOR'S SPEECH THREE HOURS LONG AND HAVING CHOSEN LENTHAL FOR THEIR SPEAKER IMMEDIATELY ENTERED INTO A DISCUSSION OF THE PRETENDED INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND OF THAT AUTHORITY WHICH CROMWELL BY THE TITLE OF PROTECTOR HAD ASSUMED OVER THE NATION
ONLY WITH THIS DISTINCTION THAT THE LATTER SECT BEING INTRODUCED A FEW YEARS BEFORE DID NOT AS YET COMPREHEND ALL THOSE WHO WERE FAVORABLE TO THE CHURCH AND TO MONARCHY
WINDHAM TOLD THE KING THAT SIR THOMAS HIS FATHER IN THE YEAR 1636 A FEW DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH CALLED TO HIM HIS FIVE SONS
IT WAS WITH THE KING'S CONSENT AND HE DID IMPORTANT SERVICE IN SENDING OVER A BODY OF MEN TO MONTROSE FOOTNOTE 9
NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND MENACES AND INSULTS HE STILL PERSISTED IN REFUSING THEIR BILL
THE FOOT UNDER SKIPPON WERE OBLIGED TO SURRENDER THEIR ARMS ARTILLERY BAGGAGE AND AMMUNITION

COMPOSITIONS FOR KNIGHTHOOD STIGMATIZED
ALL THE PETITIONS AND COMPLAINTS WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO THE COMMITTEE OF RELIGION WERE DEMANDED FROM CREW CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE
MARSHALL AND BURGESS TWO PURITANICAL CLERGYMEN WERE CHOSEN TO PREACH BEFORE THEM AND ENTERTAINED THEM WITH DISCOURSES SEVEN HOURS IN LENGTH IT BEING THE CUSTOM OF THE HOUSE ALWAYS TO TAKE THE SACRAMENT BEFORE THEY ENTER UPON BUSINESS THEY ORDERED AS A NECESSARY PRELIMINARY THAT THE COMMUNION TABLE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE EAST END OF ST MARGARET'S INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE AREA THE NAME OF THE SPIRITUAL LORDS WAS COMMONLY LEFT OUT IN ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
ALL MEN LIKEWISE HARASSED WITH WARS AND FACTIONS WERE GLAD TO SEE ANY PROSPECT OF SETTLEMENT
THEY WOULD BESTOW NO TITLES OF DISTINCTION
IF THIS BE LAW WHY DO WE TALK OF LIBERTIES
AND ITS MILITIA WHICH WAS NUMEROUS AND HAD ACQUIRED REPUTATION IN THE WARS HAD BY A LATE ORDINANCE BEEN PUT INTO HANDS IN WHOM THE PARLIAMENT COULD ENTIRELY CONFIDE
BLAKE TO WHOM MONTAGUE WAS NOW JOINED IN COMMAND AFTER RECEIVING NEW ORDERS PREPARED HIMSELF FOR HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE SPANIARDS
NIGHT PARTED THE COMBATANTS AND THE DUTCH FLEET RETIRED TOWARDS THE COAST OF HOLLAND
AND ON THIS PRETENCE SOME MONEY WAS EXACTED FROM THE PEOPLE.[V THERE WAS A LAW OF EDWARD II.,[V THAT WHOEVER WAS POSSESSED OF TWENTY POUNDS A YEAR IN LAND SHOULD BE OBLIGED WHEN SUMMONED TO APPEAR AND TO RECEIVE THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD
NOR CAN ANY RIGHTS OR LEGAL POWERS BE DERIVED FROM INJURY AND INJUSTICE
IT DISCOURAGED AND TERRIFIED ALL THE OTHER MINISTERS AND IT PREVENTED THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH STRAFFORD'S COUNSELS FROM GIVING EVIDENCE IN HIS FAVOR BEFORE THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
THE EARLS OF HERTFORD BEDFORD ESSEX BRISTOL
A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS THE CAUSE OF SO SUDDEN AND SURPRISING A VARIATION IN THE MEASURES OF THE PARLIAMENT 1 WHILE THE COMMONS WERE THUS WARMLY ENGAGED AGAINST BUCKINGHAM THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM

IF NOTWITHSTANDING THIS HE ADDS ANY MALIGNANT PARTY SHALL TAKE HEART AND BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF THEIR COUNTRY TO THEIR OWN SINISTER ENDS AND AMBITION UNDER WHATEVER PRETENCE OF RELIGION AND CONSCIENCE
SOVEREIGN PRINCES AND FREE STATES WERE IN SOME DEGREE REDUCED TO OBEDIENCE UNDER LAWS
AND CHARLES THOUGH EXTREMELY JEALOUS OF EVERY CLAIM IN POPULAR ASSEMBLIES SEEMED RATHER TO ENCOURAGE THAN REPRESS THOSE ENCROACHMENTS OF HIS CLERGY
NOR COULD HIS WHOLE PARTY HAD THEIR ARMY MET WITH A TOTAL OVERTHROW HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO GREATER CONSTERNATION
THE KING LEFT THEM AT THE DOOR AND HE HIMSELF ADVANCED ALONE THROUGH THE HALL WHILE ALL THE MEMBERS ROSE TO RECEIVE HIM
CROMWELL NEXT ACTED HIS PART AND COMMENDED THE PREACHERS FOR HAVING DEALT WITH THEM PLAINLY AND IMPARTIALLY AND TOLD THEM OF THEIR ERRORS OF WHICH THEY WERE SO UNWILLING TO BE INFORMED
THEY AGREED EACH OF THEM TO BANISH THE ENEMIES OF THE OTHER
PRECEDENTS LIKE THOSE WHICH ARE ENDEAVORED TO BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST ME MUST DRAW ALONG SUCH INCONVENIENCIES AND MISERIES THAT IN A FEW YEARS THE KINGDOM WILL BE IN THE CONDITION EXPRESSED IN A STATUTE OF HENRY IV
EVERY JOURNEY HE PERFORMED WITH HURRY AND PRECIPITATION
THE PARLIAMENT LOST NOT COURAGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE DANGER WITH WHICH THEY WERE SO NEARLY MENACED
HIS BODY BE BURIED IN THE PLACE APPROPRIATED FOR COMMON MALEFACTORS
HE HAD A NEAR KINSWOMAN MRS NORTON WHO LIVED WITHIN THREE MILES OF THAT CITY AND WAS WITH CHILD VERY NEAR THE TIME OF HER DELIVERY
AND TO BOTH THESE PARTIES THE DOMINION OF THE PRETENDED PARLIAMENT HAD EVER BEEN TO THE LAST DEGREE ODIOUS
BUT AS HE ALSO MENTIONED IN THE LETTER THE LORDS AND COMMONS OF PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED AT OXFORD AND DECLARED THAT HIS SCOPE AND INTENTION WAS TO MAKE PROVISION THAT ALL THE MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES MIGHT SECURELY MEET IN A FULL AND FREE ASSEMBLY THE PARLIAMENT PERCEIVING THE CONCLUSION IMPLIED REFUSED ALL TREATY UPON SUCH TERMS AND THE KING WHO KNEW WHAT SMALL HOPES THERE WERE OF ACCOMMODATION WOULD NOT ABANDON THE PRETENSIONS WHICH HE HAD ASSUMED
THE MILITIA OF LONDON ESPECIALLY THOUGH UTTERLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ACTION THOUGH DRAWN HUT A FEW DAYS BEFORE FROM THEIR ORDINARY OCCUPATIONS YET HAVING LEARNED ALL MILITARY EXERCISES AND BEING ANIMATED WITH UNCONQUERABLE ZEAL FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENGAGED EQUALLED ON THIS OCCASION WHAT COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE MOST VETERAN FORCES
HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
LAUDABLE
OR RATHER BY PRESENTING NOBLER AND MORE INTERESTING OBJECTS THEY AMPLY COMPENSATE THAT TRANQUILLITY OF WHICH THEY BEREAVE THE MUSES
HAD THE LIMITATIONS ON PREROGATIVE BEEN IN HIS TIME QUITE FIXED AND CERTAIN HIS INTEGRITY HAD MADE HIM REGARD AS SACRED THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CONSTITUTION
THE SENTENCE FOR THESE ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENTS WAS IMMEDIATELY REVERSED IN AN ARBITRARY MANNER BY THE COMMONS
CLEARNESS AND PROPRIETY OF STYLE ARE THE CHIEF EXCELLENCIES OF HOBBES'S WRITINGS
THE AUTHORITY OF MONK COULD SCARCELY SECURE THE PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTIES FROM THOSE INSULTS WHICH THE GENERAL HATRED AND CONTEMPT TOWARDS THEIR MASTERS DREW FROM MEN OF EVERY RANK AND DENOMINATION
NOR WAS IT IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE IMPRUDENCE TO ENRAGE HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES AND RENDER HIS OWN CONDITION MORE DESPERATE BY OPPOSING A FORCE WHICH WAS SO MUCH SUPERIOR
WITHOUT DELAY HE PREPARED WHAT WAS CALLED THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT CONTAINING THE PLAN OF THIS NEW LEGISLATURE
THAT HE SHOULD BIND HIMSELF BY HIS ROYAL PROMISE TO TAKE THE COVENANT
THEY HAD BELIEVED THAT THE KING OF SPAIN NEVER HAD ANY SINCERE INTENTION OF RESTORING THAT PRINCIPALITY
AND THE COMMONS EXPRESSED GREAT RESENTMENT ON THE OCCASION THERE REMAINS A SINGULAR PETITION OF GOODMAN BEGGING TO BE HANGED RATHER THAN PROVE A SOURCE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE KING AND HIS PEOPLE RUSH VOL
WERE IT NOT FOR THE INTEREST OF THESE PLEDGES WHICH A SAINT IN HEAVEN LEFT ME I SHOULD BE LOATH HERE HE POINTED TO HIS CHILDREN AND HIS WEEPING STOPPED HIM WHAT I FORFEIT FOR MYSELF IT IS NOTHING
THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM
44 ETC
AND HAD NONE MORE EXORBITANT OR UNREASONABLE BEEN CHALLENGED FEW BAD CONSEQUENCES HAD FOLLOWED
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS LAID WASTE BY THE RAPINE OF THE ARMY
ON THEIR APPROACH TO ANY TOWN ALL THE INHABITANTS CROWDED TO RECEIVE THEM AND WELCOMED THEIR RECEPTION WITH SHOUTS AND ACCLAMATIONS

IN THE HANDS OF THE FOUR TABLES THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE KINGDOM WAS PLACED
GIVE BELIEF TO MY EXPERIENCE NEVER TO AFFECT MORE GREATNESS OR PREROGATIVE THAN WHAT IS REALLY AND INTRINSICALLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE SUBJECTS NOT THE SATISFACTION OF FAVORITES IF YOU THUS USE IT YOU WILL NEVER WANT MEANS TO BE A FATHER TO ALL AND A BOUNTIFUL PRINCE TO ANY WHOM YOU INCLINE TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY GRACIOUS TO
FAIRFAX WAS APPROACHING WITH A POWERFUL AND VICTORIOUS ARMY AND WAS TAKING THE PROPER MEASURES FOR LAYING SIEGE TO OXFORD WHICH MUST INFALLIBLY FALL INTO HIS HANDS
THAT THE INTENTION OF SO GROSS AN ARTIFICE WAS TO ENGAGE THE COMMONS UNDER PRETENCE OF NECESSITY TO VIOLATE THE REGULAR ORDER OF PARLIAMENT
THERE WAS ONE MORRICE A GENTLEMAN OF DEVONSHIRE OF A SEDENTARY STUDIOUS DISPOSITION NEARLY RELATED TO MONK AND ONE WHO HAD ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE STRICTEST INTIMACY WITH HIM
AND THEY PROCLAIMED THE KING
537 ON A DAY APPOINTED FOR A SOLEMN FAST AND HUMILIATION ALL THE ORDERS OF TEMPORAL PEERS CONTRARY TO FORMER PRACTICE IN GOING TO CHURCH TOOK PLACE OF THE SPIRITUAL
THE RIGHT WING BY PRINCE RUPERT
HE REQUIRED THE COVENANT TO BE RENOUNCED AND RECALLED
396 418
WILLIS DISCOVERED THE WHOLE TO THE PROTECTOR
WE SHALL ENDEAVOR TO EXHIBIT A JUST IDEA OF THE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED FOR SOME YEARS SO FAR AS THEY REGARD FOREIGN AFFAIRS THE STATE OF THE COURT AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NATION
THOUGH NO STIPULATIONS TO THAT PURPOSE HAD BEEN MENTIONED BY THEIR COMMISSIONERS
THE BENCH OF BISHOPS BEING NOW ABOLISHED THE PARLIAMENT LAID HOLD OF THE OPPORTUNITY AND TOTALLY SET ASIDE THE LORDS OF ARTICLES
EVERY DAY PRODUCED SOME NEW HARANGUE ON PAST GRIEVANCES
HE RESOLVED TO KEEP NO LONGER ANY TERMS WITH THE ROYALISTS WHO THOUGH THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPLACABLE OF HIS ENEMIES WERE THOSE WHOM HE COULD OPPRESS UNDER THE MOST PLAUSIBLE PRETENCES AND WHO MET WITH LEAST COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION FROM HIS ADHERENTS
753
ALL COMPOSURE OF MIND WAS NOW FOREVER FLED FROM THE PROTECTOR
NO EXCUSE ON THE KING'S PART OR ALLEVIATION HOW REASONABLE SOEVER COULD BE HEARKENED TO OR ADMITTED
THE ENGLISH FLEET LAY OFF THE COAST OF HOLLAND AND TOTALLY INTERRUPTED THE COMMERCE OF THAT REPUBLIC
TWO MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE SIR DUDLEY DIGGES AND SIR JOHN ELLIOT WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS MANAGERS OF THE IMPEACHMENT AGAINST THE DUKE WERE THROWN INTO PRISON THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES
AND EVERY BODY SAW THE REASON WHY HE OPPOSED THE ELEVATION OF THAT AMBITIOUS GENERAL BY WHOSE SUCCESS HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE KNEW WOULD SOON BE SUBVERTED
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE TYRANNY EXERCISED BY THE SCOTTISH CLERGY HAD GIVEN WARNING NOT TO ALLOW LAYMEN A PLACE IN THE PROVINCIAL OR NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES
HIS STYLE IS PROLIX AND REDUNDANT AND SUFFOCATES US BY THE LENGTH OF ITS PERIODS
THE SCOTS RETURNED HOME AND THE ENGLISH WERE SEPARATED INTO THEIR SEVERAL COUNTIES AND DISMISSED
AND THEY DESIRED HIM TO ACQUIESCE IN THEIR SETTLEMENT OF THE MILITIA AND TO CONFER ON THEIR ADHERENTS THE ENTIRE POWER OF THE SWORD
HE CHOSE THE OPPORTUNITY OF A REVIEW THAT HE MIGHT DISPLAY THE GREATER BOLDNESS AND SPREAD THE TERROR THE WIDER
AND THOUGH HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN ACCUSTOMED ONLY TO LAND SERVICE INTO WHICH TOO HE HAD NOT ENTERED TILL PAST FIFTY YEARS OF AGE HE SOON RAISED THE NAVAL GLORY OF THE NATION TO A GREATER HEIGHT THAN IT HAD EVER ATTAINED IN ANY FORMER PERIOD
A METHOD OF PROCEEDING DECLARED ILLEGAL BY THAT VERY PETITION OF RIGHT FOR WHICH A FORMER PARLIAMENT HAD SO STRENUOUSLY CONTENDED AND WHICH AFTER GREAT EFFORTS THEY HAD EXTORTED FROM THE KING
AND THEY EXPECTED BY THE TERROR OF THE SWORD TO IMPOSE A MORE PERFECT SYSTEM OF LIBERTY ON THE RELUCTANT NATION
THE ROYALISTS THOUGH OPPRESSED HARASSED PERSECUTED DISDAINED ALL AFFINITY WITH THEIR MASTERS
THEY PROBABLY HOPED THAT THE KING WOULD FROM THEIR SERVICES BE MORE EASILY INDUCED TO RATIFY A TREATY WHICH WAS CONCLUDED THAN TO CONSENT TO ITS CONCLUSION
BUT LEST A SERVILE IMITATION MIGHT SHOCK THE PRIDE OF HIS ANCIENT KINGDOM A FEW ALTERATIONS IN ORDER TO SAVE APPEARANCES WERE MADE IN IT
HE SIGHED HE WEPT HE CANTED HE PRAYED

THE PARLIAMENT ALARMED AT THIS APPEARANCE OF THE ROYALISTS GAVE A COMMISSION TO RUTHVEN A SCOTCHMAN GOVERNOR OF PLYMOUTH TO MARCH WITH ALL THE FORCES TO DORSET
THE YOUNG MONARCH OF FRANCE THOUGH ASPIRING AND WARLIKE IN HIS CHARACTER WAS AT THIS TIME ENTIRELY OCCUPIED IN THE PLEASURES OF LOVE AND GALLANTRY AND HAD PASSIVELY RESIGNED THE REINS OF EMPIRE INTO THE HANDS OF HIS POLITIC MINISTER
BUT THERE PREVAILED AMONG THE GREATER PART OF THE NATION ANOTHER PRINCIPLE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST DANGEROUS NATURE
HAVING MADE THIS CONCESSION THE COMMONS CONTINUED TO CARRY THEIR SCRUTINY INTO EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT
THE ANCIENT FATHERS TOO BORE TESTIMONY TO EPISCOPAL JURISDICTION

HE WAS EVEN SUSPECTED IN THE FIELD NOT TO HAVE PUSHED TO THE UTMOST AGAINST THE KING THE ADVANTAGES OBTAINED BY THE ARMS OF THE PARLIAMENT
AND EACH CONCESSION WHICH HE IS CONSTRAINED TO MAKE IS REGARDED AS A TEMPORARY TRIBUTE PAID TO FACTION AND SEDITION AND IS SECRETLY ATTENDED WITH A RESOLUTION OF SEIZING EVERY FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY TO RETRACT IT
THESE CONJOINED WITH MONK'S ARMY WHICH LAY UNITED AT LONDON WERE ESTEEMED A SUFFICIENT CHECK ON THE MORE NUMEROUS THOUGH DISPERSED ARMY OF WHOSE INCLINATIONS THERE WAS STILL MUCH REASON TO BE DIFFIDENT MONK HOWEVER WAS EVERY DAY REMOVING THE MORE OBNOXIOUS OFFICERS AND BRINGING THE TROOPS TO A STATE OF DISCIPLINE AND OBEDIENCE
THEY WERE COMPOSED OF FIVE OR SIX ANCIENT PEERS OF SEVERAL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE AND DISTINCTION AND OF SOME OFFICERS WHO HAD RISEN FROM THE MEANEST STATIONS
ALL GLAMORGAN'S VIEW WAS TO GET TROOPS FOR THE KING'S SERVICE WITHOUT HURTING HIS OWN HONOR OR HIS MASTER'S
THEY RESOLVED TO SEEK THEIR OWN SECURITY AS WELL AS GREATNESS BY ENLARGING POPULAR AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND
AND AS THE ANSWER SEEMED OBVIOUS IT WAS INFERRED THAT THE ASSEMBLY BEING CHRIST'S COUNCIL WAS SUPERIOR IN ALL SPIRITUAL MATTERS TO THE PARLIAMENT WHICH WAS ONLY THE KING'S
BUT BETWEEN RESISTING A PRINCE AND DETHRONING HIM THERE IS A WIDE INTERVAL
HARRISON WAS THE PERSON APPOINTED TO JOIN IN PRAYER WITH THE UNWARY GENERAL
SUCH WAS THEIR FRENZY THAT THE CATTLE WHICH THEY HAD SEIZED AND BY RAPINE MADE THEIR OWN YET BECAUSE THEY BORE THE NAME OF ENGLISH WERE WANTONLY SLAUGHTERED OR WHEN COVERED WITH WOUNDS TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WOODS OR DESERTS THE STATELY BUILDINGS OR COMMODIOUS HABITATIONS OF THE PLANTERS AS IF UPBRAIDING THE SLOTH AND IGNORANCE OF THE NATIVES WERE CONSUMED WITH FIRE OR LAID LEVEL WITH THE GROUND
THE FIRST REFORMERS IN ENGLAND AS IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAD EMBRACED THE MOST RIGID TENETS OF PREDESTINATION AND ABSOLUTE DECREES AND HAD COMPOSED UPON THAT SYSTEM ALL THE ARTICLES OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CREED
AND BEING GENERALLY UNKNOWN TO THE PERSON HIMSELF THOUGH MORE DANGEROUS IT IMPLIES LESS FALSEHOOD THAN ANY OTHER SPECIES OF INSINCERITY
AND IN ORDER TO AVOID PUNISHMENT THEY AGREED TO LEND THE KING SIX THOUSAND POUNDS
AND THEIR PAST CONDUCT AND SUFFERINGS GAVE THEM CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO EFFECT ALL THEIR PURPOSES
THE BANDS OF SOCIETY WERE EVERY WHERE LOOSENED
AND THAT ONCE THEY HAD A MIND TO HAVE CLOSED WITH HIM
AND IN THE INTERVALS OF THE FITS HE WAS ABLE TO WALK ABROAD
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TIME WERE MADE THAT THE PETITION OF RIGHT WAS IN SOME INSTANCES VIOLATED
BUT WAS SOON SUPPRESSED BY A PARTY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY
AND THAT THOUGH THEY DELIVERED THEIR KING INTO THE HANDS OF HIS OPEN ENEMIES THEY WERE THEMSELVES AS MUCH HIS OPEN ENEMIES AS THOSE TO WHOM THEY SURRENDERED HIM
THE ROYALISTS WERE SO MUCH ENRAGED BY THE INJURIES WHICH THEY HAD SUFFERED THAT THE OTHER PREVAILING PARTIES WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO THEM WHO THEY KNEW WERE ENABLED MERELY BY THE EXECUTION OF THE ANCIENT LAWS TO TAKE SEVERE VENGEANCE UPON THEM
A CLEAR PROOF THAT HIS FALSEHOOD WAS NOT SUSPECTED
NAY SOME UNMINDFUL OF THEMSELVES AS THOUGH THEY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT SURVIVE THEIR BELOVED PRINCE IT IS REPORTED SUDDENLY FELL DOWN DEAD
SUCH OF THE OFFICERS AS DESIRED IT HAD PASSES TO RETIRE BEYOND SEA
A COUNTRY BARBAROUS UNCULTIVATED AND LAID WASTE BY MASSACRES AND CIVIL COMMOTIONS
AND REGARDED HIM AS HIS CHIEF MINISTER AND COUNSELLOR
AND NO DIFFERENCE OF VIEWS AMONG THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD ANY LONGER BE APPREHENDED
BEING SENSIBLE THAT FROM THENCE HAD PROCEEDED MANY OF THE PAST DISORDERS
IT IS INDEED CERTAIN THAT STRONG COMPUNCTION FOR HIS CONSENT TO STRAFFORD'S EXECUTION ATTENDED THIS UNFORTUNATE PRINCE DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE
ALL REASONABLE MEN NOW CONCLUDED THAT THE VERY MASK OF LIBERTY WAS THROWN ASIDE AND THAT THE NATION WAS FOREVER SUBJECTED TO MILITARY AND DESPOTIC GOVERNMENT EXERCISED NOT IN THE LEGAL MANNER OF EUROPEAN NATIONS BUT ACCORDING TO THE MAXIMS OF EASTERN TYRANNY
MONK HE SAW HAD PASSED THE TWEED AT COLDSTREAM AND WAS ADVANCING UPON HIM
BUT WHAT ARE THE INCONVENIENCIES SO MUCH DREADED

BUT NO SOONER DID ADVERSITY SEIZE HIM THAN THE CONCEALED AVERSION OF THE NATION BLAZED UP AT ONCE AND THE IRISH PARLIAMENT USED EVERY EXPEDIENT TO AGGRAVATE THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM
BUT SO LONG AS THE CHURCHES AND THE ECCLESIASTICAL REVENUES WERE KEPT FROM THE PRIESTS AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ENDURE THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PROFANE HERETICS BEING THEMSELVES DISCONTENTED THEY CONTINUALLY ENDEAVORED TO RETARD ANY CORDIAL RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND THE IRISH NATIONS
THE ALLIANCE WITH THE HIERARCHY STRENGTHENED LAW BY THE SANCTION OF RELIGION
THEY ORDERED HALBERTS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE HALL WHERE THEY ASSEMBLED AND THUS ARMED THEMSELVES AGAINST THOSE CONSPIRACIES WITH WHICH THEY PRETENDED THEY WERE HOURLY THREATENED
AND NOTHING TENDED FURTHER TO RECOMMEND AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS TAKE OPINIONS IN THE LUMP THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FORMER SECT
HAD HE POSSESSED ANY MILITARY FORCE ON WHICH HE COULD RELY IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT HE HAD AT ONCE TAKEN OFF THE MASK AND GOVERNED WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES
THAT A GREAT BODY OF MEN DISCIPLINED BY THE GOVERNMENT WERE NOW THROWN LOOSE AND WERE READY FOR ANY DARING OR DESPERATE ENTERPRISE
THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY
THIS COMPANY CONSISTED OF TWO HUNDRED MEN OF WHOM A HUNDRED WERE VOLUNTEERS OFTEN MEN OF FAMILY AND FORTUNE SOMETIMES NOBLEMEN WHO LIVED UPON THEIR OWN INCOME IN A SPLENDID MANNER
THAT RUSTIC CONTEMPT OF THE FAIR SEX WHICH JAMES AFFECTED AND WHICH BANISHING THEM FROM HIS COURT MADE IT RESEMBLE MORE A FAIR OR AN EXCHANGE THAN THE SEAT OF A GREAT PRINCE WAS VERY WIDE OF THE DISPOSITION OF THIS MONARCH
CHARLES PARTLY REPENTING OF THE LARGE CONCESSIONS MADE TO THE SCOTS PARTLY DISGUSTED AT THEIR FRESH INSOLENCE AND PRETENSIONS SEIZED THIS OPPORTUNITY OF BREAKING WITH THEM
TO THE REST OF THE PEOPLE OF PERPETUAL SERVITUDE BENEATH THOSE SANCTIFIED ROBBERS WHOSE UNION AND WHOSE DIVISIONS WOULD BE EQUALLY DESTRUCTIVE AND WHO UNDER PRETENCE OF SUPERIOR ILLUMINATIONS WOULD SOON EXTIRPATE IF POSSIBLE ALL PRIVATE MORALITY AS THEY HAD ALREADY DONE ALL PUBLIC LAW AND JUSTICE FROM THE BRITISH DOMINIONS
BUT WHEN THAT POTENT HAND WAS REMOVED WHICH CONDUCTED THE GOVERNMENT EVERY ONE EXPECTED A SUDDEN DISSOLUTION OF THE UNWIELDY AND ILL-JOINTED FABRIC
NOR WOULD THE VERY IMAGE OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT BE LONGER UPHELD THAN WHILE CONFORMABLE TO HIS ARBITRARY WILL AND PLEASURE
HE TOLD THEM THAT THEY WERE A MISERABLY DELUDED AND DELUDING PEOPLE
THIS HONOR HAVE ALL HIS SAINTS PSALM CXLIX VER
NOTE Q P
AND THUS EXTREMES WERE EVERY WHERE AFFECTED AND THE JUST MEDIUM WAS GRADUALLY DESERTED BY ALL MEN
THE KING SAYS THAT HE BELIEVED BRET TO BE AS MUCH HIS AS ANY PAPIST COULD BE
JAMES WAS ANXIOUS TO DISCOURAGE THE PRACTICE OF DUELLING WHICH WAS THEN VERY PREVALENT
AT A MEDIUM THIS TAX MIGHT HAVE AFFORDED ABOUT A MILLION A YEAR
SHE HAD EVEN BEEN OBLIGED TO SET UP A BREWERY AT HUNTINGDON WHICH SHE MANAGED TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
AND THEY ADDED THAT IF SUCH REMEDIES WERE ANY LONGER SUSPENDED THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO EXTREMITIES NOT FIT TO BE NAMED AND MAKE GOOD THE SAYING THAT NECESSITY HAS NO LAW ANOTHER PETITION WAS PRESENTED BY SEVERAL POOR PEOPLE OR BEGGARS IN THE NAME OF MANY THOUSANDS MORE
AT FIRST THEY PRETENDED ONLY TO PETITION FOR WHAT CONCERNED THEMSELVES AS SOLDIERS

AND IRETON AFTER A VIGOROUS SIEGE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF IT
AS HE APPROACHED TO GLOUCESTER THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO RAISE THE SIEGE AND OPEN THE WAY FOR ESSEX TO ENTER THAT CITY

THE KING BY THE MAXIMS OF LAW COULD DO NO WRONG
THEIR FISHERIES WERE TOTALLY SUSPENDED
THEIR COLONEL FROM HIS OWN NATURAL CHARACTER AS WELL AS FROM POLICY WAS SUFFICIENTLY INCLINED TO INCREASE THE FLAME
CHARLES THEREFORE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH OBSERVING IN GENERAL THAT EVEN DURING THAT PERIOD SO MUCH COMPLAINED OF THE PEOPLE ENJOYED A GREAT MEASURE OF HAPPINESS NOT ONLY COMPARATIVELY IN RESPECT OF THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT EVEN IN RESPECT OF THOSE TIMES WHICH WERE JUSTLY ACCOUNTED THE MOST FORTUNATE
SO HIGH WAS THE NATIONAL IDOLATRY TOWARDS PARLIAMENTS THAT TO BLAME THE PAST CONDUCT OF THESE ASSEMBLIES WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY ILL RECEIVED BY THE GENERALITY OF THE PEOPLE
HIS GENERALS HIS ADMIRALS HIS JUDGES HIS AMBASSADORS WERE PERSONS WHO CONTRIBUTED ALL OF THEM IN THEIR SEVERAL SPHERES TO THE SECURITY OF THE PROTECTOR AND TO THE HONOR AND INTEREST OF THE NATION
PERHAPS TOO THE POPULAR LEADERS IMPLACABLE AND ARTFUL SAW THE OPPORTUNITY FAVORABLE

HE REFUSED TO HEAR THEM EXCEPT IN THE PRESENCE OF SOME OF THE SECLUDED MEMBERS
THERE ARE TWO CIRCUMSTANCES IN CHARLES'S CHARACTER SEEMINGLY INCOMPATIBLE WHICH ATTENDED HIM DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS REIGN AND WERE IN PART THE CAUSE OF HIS MISFORTUNES
TO PREVENT THESE MISCHIEFS THE ARMY OFFERED TO COME UP AND GUARD THAT ASSEMBLY SO SHALL THE NATION AS THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN THE CONCLUSION NOT ONLY BE VINDICATED FROM PRECEDING INNOVATIONS BUT BE SECURED FROM THE FUTURE WHICH ARE THREATENED AND WHICH ARE LIKELY TO PRODUCE MORE DANGEROUS EFFECTS THAN THE FORMER THE DRAUGHT OF THIS PETITION BEING CONVEYED TO THE KING HE WAS PREVAILED ON SOMEWHAT IMPRUDENTLY TO COUNTERSIGN IT HIMSELF AS A MARK OF HIS APPROBATION

MANNING WHO HAD ACCESS TO THE KING'S FAMILY KEPT A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM
AND THOUGH A PRISONER IN THE HANDS OF HIS MOST INVETERATE ENEMIES HE SUPPORTED TOWARDS ALL WHO APPROACHED HIM THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH
HE ORDERED LAMBERT WITH A BODY OF CAVALRY TO HANG UPON THE REAR OF THE ROYAL ARMY AND INFEST THEIR MARCH
THE LORDS PERCEIVING THE SPIRIT BY WHICH THE KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE COMMONS WAS ANIMATED HASTENED TO REINSTATE THEMSELVES IN THEIR ANCIENT AUTHORITY AND TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION
HE DEEMED BISHOPS ESSENTIAL TO THE VERY BEING OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH
HE EVEN ENTERED WITH THEM INTO AN EMULATION OF GHOSTLY GIFTS AND THESE MEN INSTEAD OF GRIEVING TO BE OUTDONE IN THEIR OWN WAY WERE PROUD THAT HIS HIGHNESS BY HIS PRINCELY EXAMPLE HAD DIGNIFIED THOSE PRACTICES IN WHICH THEY THEMSELVES WERE DAILY OCCUPIED CROMWELL FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT IN PART THE ADVICE WHICH HE RECEIVED FROM GENERAL HARRISON AT THE TIME WHEN THE INTIMACY AND ENDEARMENT MOST STRONGLY SUBSISTED BETWIXT THEM
WHEN PRINCES WERE IN SUCH DISPOSITIONS AND HAD SO FEW PRETENSIONS ON EACH OTHER IT COULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CONCLUDE A PEACE
WHEN THE LONG PARLIAMENT WAS RESTORED MONK WHO WAS NOT PREPARED FOR OPPOSITION ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR AUTHORITY AND WAS CONTINUED IN HIS COMMAND FROM WHICH IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAFE TO ATTEMPT DISLODGING HIM
WHERE HE LIVED TWO YEARS ON A SMALL PENSION ABOUT SIX THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR PAID HIM BY THE COURT OF FRANCE AND ON SOME CONTRIBUTIONS SENT HIM BY HIS FRIENDS IN ENGLAND
BY AN OLD STATUTE PASSED DURING THE REIGN OF EDWARD III IT HAD BEEN ENACTED THAT PARLIAMENTS SHOULD BE HELD ONCE EVERY YEAR OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF NECESSARY
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE ADMIRALTY OF HOLLAND WHO ARE DISTINCT FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATE HAD GIVEN TROMP NO ORDERS TO STRIKE BUT HAD LEFT HIM TO HIS OWN DISCRETION WITH REGARD TO THAT VAIN BUT MUCH CONTESTED CEREMONIAL
AND BY THEIR CONJUNCTION WITH THE CORNISH TROOPS A FORMIDABLE FORCE FOR NUMBERS AS WELL AS REPUTATION AND VALOR WAS COMPOSED
IN THE INQUIRY CONCERNING GRIEVANCES AND IN THE CENSURE OF PAST MEASURES LAUD COULD NOT LONG ESCAPE THE SEVERE SCRUTINY OF THE COMMONS
IN OPPOSITION TO ALL THESE STOOD THE COURT PARTY THE HIERARCHY AND THE ARMINIANS

THIS MISFORTUNE WAS FAR FROM BEING IMPOSSIBLE
WHEN THE PEOPLE BY THESE AFFECTED PANICS WERE WROUGHT UP TO A SUFFICIENT DEGREE OF RAGE AND TERROR IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER THAT THE ACCUSED MEMBERS SHOULD WITH A TRIUMPHANT AND MILITARY PROCESSION TAKE THEIR SEATS IN THE HOUSE
IN A NATION SO AVERSE TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION THESE VERY VIRTUES WERE SUFFICIENT TO DRAW ON HIM THE PUBLIC HATRED

GRIMSTONE A POPULAR MEMBER CALLED HIM IN THE HOUSE THE VERY PANDER AND BROKER TO THE WHORE OF BABYLON FINDING THAT THE SCRUTINY OF THE COMMONS WAS POINTING TOWARDS HIM AND BEING SENSIBLE THAT ENGLAND WAS NO LONGER A PLACE OF SAFETY FOR MEN OF HIS CHARACTER HE SUDDENLY MADE HIS ESCAPE INTO FRANCE THUS IN A FEW WEEKS THIS HOUSE OF COMMONS NOT OPPOSED OR RATHER SECONDED BY THE PEERS HAD PRODUCED SUCH A REVOLUTION IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE TWO MOST POWERFUL AND MOST FAVORED MINISTERS OF THE KING WERE THROWN INTO THE TOWER AND DAILY EXPECTED TO BE TRIED FOR THEIR LIFE
THE SENDING OF SHIPS TO FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE HUGONOTS
NOT ONLY THE SUPREME MAGISTRATE OWED HIS AUTHORITY TO ILLEGAL FORCE AND USURPATION
THE FACTIONS AND DISCONTENTS AMONG THEMSELVES IN THE CITY AND THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES PROGNOSTICATED SOME DANGEROUS DIVISION OR INSURRECTION
WHATEVER THEREFORE TENDED TO COMPOSE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KING AND PARLIAMENT AND TO PRESERVE THE GOVERNMENT UNIFORMLY IN ITS PRESENT CHANNEL WAS ZEALOUSLY OPPOSED BY THESE POPULAR LEADERS
1639 THE COVENANT LIKEWISE WAS ORDERED TO BE SIGNED BY EVERY ONE UNDER PAIN OF EXCOMMUNICATION THE INDEPENDENCY OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL UPON THE CIVIL POWER WAS THE OLD PRESBYTERIAN PRINCIPLE WHICH HAD BEEN ZEALOUSLY ADOPTED AT THE REFORMATION AND WHICH THOUGH JAMES AND CHARLES HAD OBLIGED THE CHURCH PUBLICLY TO DISCLAIM IT HAD SECRETLY BEEN ADHERED TO BY ALL RANKS OF PEOPLE
THE VERY LIBRARY AND MEDALS AT ST JAMES'S WERE INTENDED BY THE GENERALS TO BE BROUGHT TO AUCTION IN ORDER TO PAY THE ARREARS OF SOME REGIMENTS OF CAVALRY QUARTERED NEAR LONDON
WHILE THE OFFICERS WERE IN DEBATE COLONEL INGOLDSBY INFORMED CROMWELL THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS SITTING AND HAD COME TO A RESOLUTION NOT TO DISSOLVE THEMSELVES BUT TO FILL UP THE HOUSE BY NEW ELECTIONS
HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN
IT SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATION OF THE SAME ASSEMBLY THE INQUIRY INTO ALL GRANTS PURCHASES AND ALIENATIONS

THAT ASSEMBLY SEEMS DURING THIS WHOLE PERIOD TO HAVE ACTED IN THE MAIN A REASONABLE AND A MODERATE PART
D'EWES P
A PRACTICE FREQUENT WITH SKILFUL ARTISTS WHEN THEY DESIRE TO CLEAR THE WHEELS FROM ANY RUST WHICH MAY HAVE GROWN UPON THEM
HE HAD EVEN THROWN DOWN HIS ARMS IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SACRED COMMANDS OF THE KING
BUT HAD PERSUADED THE OFFICERS OF THEMSELVES TO TENDER THEIR DUTY TO HIS MAJESTY
AND THERE WANTED NOT OFFICERS IN THE ARMY WHO FROM LIKE MOTIVES WERE DISPOSED TO SECOND ALL THEIR UNDERTAKINGS
A PARLIAMENT WHICH FROM THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS COULD NOT BE ABRUPTLY DISSOLVED AND WHICH WAS TO EXECUTE EVERY THING LEFT UNFINISHED BY FORMER PARLIAMENTS
AND THEY WERE AFTERWARDS TO CHOOSE THE SAME NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO MIGHT SUCCEED THEM IN THAT HIGH AND IMPORTANT OFFICE
ACTS OF POWER HOWEVER IRREGULAR MIGHT CASUALLY AND AT INTERVALS BE EXERCISED BY A PRINCE FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH OR EXPEDIENCY AND YET LIBERTY STILL SUBSIST IN SOME TOLERABLE DEGREE UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION

AMBITIOUS ONLY OF TRUE GLORY DREADFUL ONLY TO HIS AVOWED ENEMIES
SIR JOHN DAVENANT SAYS WHITLOCKE SPEAKING OF THE YEAR 1658 PUBLISHED AN OPERA NOTWITHSTANDING THE NICETY OF THE TIMES
BY CONTINUING THEIR VIOLENT PERSECUTION AND STILL MORE VIOLENT MENACES AGAINST PRIESTS AND PAPISTS THEY CONFIRMED THE IRISH CATHOLICS IN THEIR REBELLION AND CUT OFF ALL HOPES OF INDULGENCE AND TOLERATION
HIS BODY ALSO FROM THE CONTAGION OF HIS ANXIOUS MIND BEGAN TO BE AFFECTED AND HIS HEALTH SEEMED SENSIBLY TO DECLINE
WHILE THE DISORDERS OF THE ARMY WERE YET IN THEIR INFANCY HE KEPT AT A DISTANCE LEST HIS COUNTERFEIT AVERSION MIGHT THROW A DAMP UPON THEM OR HIS SECRET ENCOURAGEMENT BEGET SUSPICION IN THE PARLIAMENT
AND ATTACKING IT ON ALL SIDES AND MEETING WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE EXCEPT FROM DUKE HAMILTON AND GENERAL MIDDLETON BROKE IN UPON THE DISORDERED ROYALISTS
THE KING ENTERED LONDON ON THE TWENTY-NINTH OF MAY WHICH WAS ALSO HIS BIRTHDAY
ERECT IN THEIR PLACE THE DOMINION OF THE SAINTS AND GIVE REALITY TO THE MOST VISIONARY IDEA WHICH THE HEATED IMAGINATION OF ANY FANATIC WAS EVER ABLE TO ENTERTAIN
SEA FIGHTS ARE SELDOM SO DECISIVE AS TO DISABLE THE VANQUISHED FROM MAKING HEAD IN A LITTLE TIME AGAINST THE VICTORS
SCARCELY WAS IT PERMITTED TO FIND FAULT WITH THE CONDUCT OF ANY PARTICULAR MEMBER IF HE MADE A FIGURE IN THE HOUSE
534
WE ARE ONLY ASSURED THAT HE NOW DISCOVERED TO HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS THESE ASPIRING VIEWS
THEY CARRIED THE KING ALONG WITH THEM IN ALL THEIR MARCHES
THEY SENT ONE OF THEIR NUMBER TO TREAT WITH THE FEMALES
AND THAT HEREAFTER NO COMMISSIONS OF LIKE NATURE MAY ISSUE FORTH TO ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHATSOEVER TO BE EXECUTED AS AFORESAID LEST BY COLOR OF THEM ANY OF YOUR MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS BE DESTROYED OR PUT TO DEATH CONTRARY TO THE LAWS AND FRANCHISE OF THE LAND
HE AUGMENTED THEIR PAY
1641 THE BISHOPS BEING FORBIDDEN BY THE ANCIENT CANONS TO ASSIST IN TRIALS FOR LIFE AND BEING UNWILLING BY ANY OPPOSITION TO IRRITATE THE COMMONS WHO WERE ALREADY MUCH PREJUDICED AGAINST THEM THOUGHT PROPER OF THEMSELVES TO WITHDRAW THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW-CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL

WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION
BY ONE AND THE SAME THING HAVE THE KING AND THE PEOPLE BEEN HURT AND BY THE SAME MUST THEY BE CURED
BUT WAS DISSUADED BY HIS FRIENDS FROM EXERTING THIS ACT OF REGAL AUTHORITY
THAT MINISTERS ARE ABOLISHED AS ANTI-CHRISTIAN AND OF NO LONGER USE NOW CHRIST HIMSELF DESCENDS INTO THE HEARTS OF HIS SAINTS AND HIS SPIRIT ENLIGHTENETH THEM WITH REVELATIONS AND INSPIRATIONS
HE HAS CHOSEN OTHER INSTRUMENTS FOR CARRYING ON HIS WORK SIR HARRY VANE EXCLAIMING AGAINST THIS PROCEEDING HE CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE O
FOR IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THIS PARTY MADE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NATION AS MUCH A PART OF THEIR RELIGION AS THE CHURCH PARTY DID THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN
AND URGED THE MANY DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH THE ROYALISTS LABORED AND FROM WHICH NOTHING BUT A VICTORY COULD RELIEVE THEM
SO GREAT PRUDENCE AND RESERVE IN SUCH MATERIAL POINTS DOES GREAT HONOR TO THE PARLIAMENT

THE DECISIVE BATTLE OF LEIPSIC WAS FOUGHT SOON AFTER WHERE THE CONDUCT OF TILLY AND THE VALOR OF THE IMPERIALISTS WERE OVERCOME BY THE SUPERIOR CONDUCT OF GUSTAVUS AND THE SUPERIOR VALOR OF THE SWEDES

CHECKED BY THE PRELATES IN THE LICENSE OF PREACHING THE CLERGY REGARDED EPISCOPAL JURISDICTION BOTH AS A TYRANNY AND A USURPATION AND MAINTAINED A PARITY AMONG ECCLESIASTICS TO BE A DIVINE PRIVILEGE WHICH NO HUMAN LAW COULD ALTER OR INFRINGE
MEANWHILE RICHELIEU DIED AND SOON AFTER HIM THE FRENCH KING LOUIS XIII LEAVING HIS SON AN INFANT FOUR YEARS OLD AND HIS WIDOW ANNE OF AUSTRIA REGENT OF THE KINGDOM

IF SOME FEW INSTANCES ARE FOUND OF VIOLATIONS MADE ON THE PETITION OF RIGHT WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD GRANTED THERE IS AN EASIER AND MORE NATURAL WAY FOR PREVENTING THE RETURN OF LIKE INCONVENIENCIES THAN BY A TOTAL ABOLITION OF ROYAL AUTHORITY
WITHOUT DEPARTING FROM ECONOMY HE WAS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO SERVED HIM
AND PRYNNE EMPLOYED A GREAT NUMBER OF PAGES TO PERSUADE MEN TO AFFECT THE NAME OF PURITAN AS IF CHRIST HAD BEEN A PURITAN
HOLLIS IN PARTICULAR EXHORTED THEM NOT TO SPARE ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION EITHER THEIR PURSES THEIR PERSONS OR THEIR PRAYERS AND IN GENERAL IT MUST BE CONFESSED THEY WERE SUFFICIENTLY LIBERAL IN ALL THESE CONTRIBUTIONS
1327
EVEN MEN OF SENSE WERE APT TO BLAME THIS CONDUCT NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT GAVE OFFENCE IN ENGLAND BUT BECAUSE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IT LOST THE CROWN THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING CONSIDERED AS THE HEAD AND SUPPORT OF THE REFORMATION ON PRETENCE OF PACIFYING DISPUTES ORDERS WERE ISSUED FROM THE COUNCIL FORBIDDING ON BOTH SIDES ALL PREACHING AND PRINTING WITH REGARD TO THE CONTROVERTED POINTS OF PREDESTINATION AND FREE WILL
CHAPTER LX
LORD LANSDOWN P
LORD LANSDOWN P
1628 THERE WAS REASON TO APPREHEND SOME DISORDER OR INSURRECTION FROM THE DISCONTENTS WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND
THOUGH SINCE IN THE HURRY OF AFFAIRS AND THE SHOCK OF WARS AND FACTIONS IT HAD NO DOUBT BEEN CONSIDERABLY OBLITERATED
FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED
USHER NOTWITHSTANDING HIS BEING A BISHOP RECEIVED A PENSION FROM HIM
THAT THE BISHOPS SHOULD EXERCISE NO ACT OF JURISDICTION OR ORDINATION WITHOUT THE CONSENT AND COUNSEL OF SUCH PRESBYTERS AS SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY THE CLERGY OF EACH DIOCESE
AND WHEN THAT TOWN WAS TAKEN HE ESCAPED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND ALMOST ALONE INTO PLYMOUTH
FIVE THOUSAND MEN ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THE LOSS OF THE TWO ARMIES AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE BY THE OPPOSITE ACCOUNTS WAS NEARLY EQUAL
HE REPRESENTED THE INDIGNITY OF THE ACTION THAT SO GREAT A PRINCESS MOTHER TO THE KING OF FRANCE AND TO THE QUEENS OF SPAIN AND ENGLAND SHOULD BE AFFRONTED BY THE MULTITUDE
WALLER WAS SO CONFIDENT OF TAKING THIS BODY OF INFANTRY NOW ABANDONED BY THE HORSE THAT HE WROTE TO THE PARLIAMENT THAT THEIR WORK WAS DONE AND THAT BY THE NEXT POST HE WOULD INFORM THEM OF THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF THE PRISONERS
A PISTOL WHICH HE CARRIED IN HIS POCKET WENT OFF AND BY THAT SINGULAR GOOD FORTUNE WHICH EVER ATTENDED HIM HE WAS TAKEN UP WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERABLE HURT OR BRUISE FOOTNOTE 27
AND LEVEN HAVING JOINED LORD FAIRFAX THEY SAT DOWN BEFORE YORK TO WHICH THE ARMY OF THE ROYALISTS HAD RETIRED
DON PANTALEON BROTHER TO THE PORTUGUESE AMBASSADOR AND JOINED WITH HIM IN THE SAME COMMISSION FANCYING HIMSELF TO BE INSULTED CAME UPON THE EXCHANGE ARMED AND ATTENDED BY SEVERAL SERVANTS
AND THE LEAST FAVORABLE CENSORS OF HIS MERIT ALLOWED THAT THE FIDELITY AND SERVICES OF A WHOLE LIFE HAD SUFFICIENTLY ATONED FOR ONE RASH ACTION INTO WHICH HIS PASSION HAD BETRAYED HIM PRINCE RUPERT WITH EQUAL PRECIPITATION DREW OFF THE REMAINS OF HIS ARMY AND RETIRED INTO LANCASHIRE
ALL GOVERNMENT PURELY MILITARY FLUCTUATES PERPETUALLY BETWEEN A DESPOTIC MONARCHY AND A DESPOTIC ARISTOCRACY ACCORDING AS THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHIEF COMMANDER PREVAILS OR THAT OF THE OFFICERS NEXT HIM IN RANK AND DIGNITY
AND AS THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THEY MUST OWE THEIR PREFERMENT ENTIRELY TO THEIR WEIGHT AND CONSIDERATION IN PARLIAMENT THEY WERE MOST OF THEM RESOLVED STILL TO ADHERE TO THAT ASSEMBLY AND BOTH TO PROMOTE ITS AUTHORITY AND TO PRESERVE THEIR OWN CREDIT IN IT
HE WOULD NOT ALLOW HIS SOLDIERS TO PERPLEX THEIR HEADS WITH THOSE SUBTLETIES OF FIGHTING BY THE KING'S AUTHORITY AGAINST HIS PERSON AND OF OBEYING HIS MAJESTY'S COMMANDS SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
GLOUCESTER LYING WITHIN TWENTY MILES PRESENTED AN EASIER YET A VERY IMPORTANT CONQUEST
AND THOUGH NOT DEFECTIVE IN ANY TALENT EXCEPT THAT OF ELOCUTION THE ABILITIES WHICH IN HIM WERE MOST ADMIRABLE AND WHICH MOST CONTRIBUTED TO HIS MARVELLOUS SUCCESS WERE THE MAGNANIMOUS RESOLUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HIS PECULIAR DEXTERITY IN DISCOVERING THE CHARACTERS AND PRACTISING ON THE WEAKNESSES OF MANKIND
AND ON PRETENCE OF EASING THE PUBLIC BURDENS THEY LEVELLED A DEADLY BLOW AT THE OPPOSITE FACTION
WHAT IS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF POPULARITY THE PRIVILEGE OF AFFIXING EPITHETS FELL OF COURSE TO THAT PARTY
AND THOSE COMMITTEES INTO WHICH HE WAS ADMITTED WERE CHOSEN FOR AFFAIRS WHICH WOULD MORE INTEREST THE ZEALOTS THAN THE MEN OF BUSINESS
ALL THE WRITERS OF THAT AGE EXCEPT CLARENDON REPRESENT THE KING'S GOING TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AS VOLUNTARY AND INTENDED
NOR SHOULD WE IMAGINE THAT OPPORTUNITIES OF THAT KIND WILL NOT OFFER IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS
THERE HAD LONG PREVAILED IN THAT PARTY A SECRET DISTINCTION WHICH THOUGH THE DREAD OF THE KING'S POWER HAD HITHERTO SUPPRESSED IT YET IN PROPORTION AS THE HOPES OF SUCCESS BECAME NEARER AND MORE IMMEDIATE BEGAN TO DISCOVER ITSELF WITH HIGH CONTEST AND ANIMOSITY
THEY TOOK NOTICE OF THE VIOLATIONS OF LIBERTY ABOVE MENTIONED AGAINST WHICH THE PETITION OF RIGHT SEEMS TO HAVE PROVIDED A SUFFICIENT REMEDY
SO LITTLE APOLOGY WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR PAST MEASURES SO CONTAGIOUS THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF DISCONTENT THAT EVEN MEN OF THE MOST MODERATE TEMPERS AND THE MOST ATTACHED TO THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY EXERTED THEMSELVES WITH THE UTMOST VIGOR IN THE REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES AND IN PROSECUTING THE AUTHORS OF THEM
PRESENTS TOO OF WHICH AS WELL AS OF FLATTERY THESE HOLY MEN WERE NOT INSENSIBLE WERE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM AS A SMALL RETRIBUTION FOR THEIR PRAYERS AND GHOSTLY COUNSEL
LORD ORRERY IN THE TIME OF HIS GREATNESS WITH CROMWELL JUST AFTER HE HAD SO SEASONABLY RELIEVED HIM IN HIS GREAT DISTRESS AT CLONMELL RIDING OUT OF YOUGHALL ONE DAY WITH HIM AND IRETON THEY FELL INTO DISCOURSE ABOUT THE KING'S DEATH
THE STYLE OF THIS AUTHOR WANTS EASE AND FLUENCY
OCTOBER 17 1650
STILL HE SCRUPLED TO COMMIT ANY THING TO WRITING
BY THIS IRRUPTION HOWEVER NOTHING BUT THE SUBURBS WAS YET GAINED
THE ARMY INDEED HE WAS SORRY TO SAY IT DID NOT CORRESPOND BY ITS DISCIPLINE TO THE MERIT OF THE OFFICERS
THIS WAS THE MAN WHO ACQUIRED SO GREAT AN ASCENDANT OVER CHARLES AND WHO LED HIM BY THE FACILITY OF HIS TEMPER INTO A CONDUCT WHICH PROVED SO FATAL TO HIMSELF AND TO HIS KINGDOMS
SECRETARY CARLETON WAS SENT BY THE KING TO INFORM STRAFFORD OF THE FINAL RESOLUTION WHICH NECESSITY HAD EXTORTED FROM HIM
AFTER THE DISPERSION OF THE ARMY NO FURTHER PROTECTION REMAINED TO THEM EITHER FOR LIFE OR PROPERTY BUT THE CLEMENCY OF ENRAGED VICTORS
AND HE NARROWLY ESCAPED
THIS PARLIAMENT TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE ABOLITION OF THE CLERICAL FUNCTION AS SAVORING OF POPERY
943
AND A RUMOR WHICH WAS SPREAD THAT PEACE HAD BEEN CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE FRENCH KING AND THE HUGONOTS ASSISTED HIM IN HIS PURPOSE
SOME MALIGNANTS ALSO CREPT IN UNDER VARIOUS PRETENCES
BUT AS THESE HAD BEEN SO MUCH EMPLOYED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME AND HAD GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH SUPERSTITION OR WHAT THE PURITANS CALLED IDOLATRY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE THEM INTO ENGLISH CHURCHES WITHOUT EXCITING GENERAL MURMURS AND COMPLAINTS
89
HIS SOUL WITHOUT EFFORT OR AFFECTATION SEEMED ONLY TO REMAIN IN THE SITUATION FAMILIAR TO IT AND TO LOOK DOWN WITH CONTEMPT ON ALL THE EFFORTS OF HUMAN MALICE AND INIQUITY
AND HE PROMISED TO BESTOW COMMISSIONS BUT SUCH AS SHOULD BE REVOCABLE AT PLEASURE ON THE SAME PERSONS WHOM THE PARLIAMENT HAD NAMED IN THE BILL BY A FORMER MESSAGE HE HAD EXPRESSED HIS WISHES THAT THEY WOULD LAY BEFORE HIM IN ONE VIEW ALL THE CONCESSIONS WHICH THEY DEEMED REQUISITE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION
IN THE MOST ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENTS SUCH EXPEDIENTS WOULD BE REGARDED AS IRREGULAR AND UNEQUAL
AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU
AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY
THE KING'S DECLARATION WAS WELL CALCULATED TO UPHOLD THE SATISFACTION INSPIRED BY THE PROSPECT OF PUBLIC SETTLEMENT
WHILE CROMWELL PROCEEDED WITH SUCH UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS IN IRELAND WHICH IN THE SPACE OF NINE MONTHS HE HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBDUED FORTUNE WAS PREPARING FOR HIM A NEW SCENE OF VICTORY AND TRIUMPH IN SCOTLAND
THE SPANISH ADMIRAL RAN HIS SHIP ASHORE
HE PRETENDED BY HIS SOLE ACT AND DEED TO DEVOLVE UPON THESE THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE
747
THE PARLIAMENT SOON COMPLETED THEIR TWO ARMIES COMMANDED BY ESSEX AND WALLER
SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE SAID
A DEPUTATION WAS SENT TO KNOW HIS WILL WITH REGARD TO HIS SUCCESSOR HIS SENSES WERE GONE AND HE COULD NOT NOW EXPRESS HIS INTENTIONS
HENCE IT IS THAT NEITHER THE KING'S ACT NOR ANY ACT OF PARLIAMENT CAN GIVE AWAY HIS PREROGATIVE FOOTNOTE 5

THE MAYOR ONE SHERIFF AND THREE ALDERMEN SENT TO THE TOWER SEVERAL CITIZENS AND OFFICERS OF THE MILITIA COMMITTED TO PRISON
ON HIS JOURNEY THE WHOLE COUNTRY FLOCKED TO BEHOLD HIM MOVED PARTLY BY CURIOSITY PARTLY BY COMPASSION AND AFFECTION
ALL SHOPS MEANWHILE WERE ORDERED TO BE SHUT
HE TALKED SPIRITUALLY TO THEM
MALIGNANT INSINUATIONS ARE JOINED TO OPEN INVECTIVES
AND AFTERWARDS SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE SO CONVINCED THEM OF THE EVIL THEY HAD DONE IN BEATING THEM THAT THE COUNTRY PEOPLE FELL A QUARRELLING AND BEAT ONE ANOTHER MORE THAN THEY HAD BEFORE BEATEN THE QUAKERS
AFTER THE MOST UNLIMITED CONCESSIONS HAD RENEWED THEIR REBELLION AND STOPPED THE PROGRESS OF HIS VICTORIES IN ENGLAND
380 381
ONE PERSON ALONE OF THE GARRISON ESCAPED TO BE A MESSENGER OF THIS UNIVERSAL HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION
THE UNSUCCESSFUL EXPEDITIONS TO CADIZ AND THE ISLE OF RHE ARE MENTIONED
NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY
AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR I THINK THIS IS NO UNFIT OCCASION TO REPEAT WHAT I HAVE SAID FORMERLY THAT WHATEVER I HAVE DONE IN FAVOR AND TO THE GOOD OF MY SUBJECTS I DO INTEND TO MAINTAIN IT WHEN THE KING WAS LOOKING AROUND FOR THE ACCUSED MEMBERS HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE
AND TO TAKE DOWN AND BREAK THE PORTCULLISES AND GATES OF THE CITY
THEY EVEN EMPLOYED THE EXPEDIENT OF PRESSING THOUGH ABOLISHED BY A LATE LAW FOR WHICH THEY HAD STRENUOUSLY CONTENDED AND THEY ENGAGED THE CITY TO SEND FOUR REGIMENTS OF ITS MILITIA TO THE RELIEF OF GLOUCESTER
AND NO RESOLUTION CAN BE MORE WISE AS WELL AS MORE JUST THAN THAT OF EMPLOYING THE PRESENT ADVANTAGES AGAINST THE KING WHO HAD FORMERLY PUSHED MUCH LESS TEMPTING ONES TO THE UTMOST EXTREMITIES AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AND HIS PARLIAMENT
BUT AS I HAVE THE WORD OF GOD AND I HOPE I SHALL EVER HAVE IT FOR THE RULE OF MY CONSCIENCE FOR MY INFORMATIONS
EXCEPT THE CHURCH UPON HIS REPENTANCE SHOULD TAKE OFF HIS EXCOMMUNICATION THE CLERGY HOPING THAT THE TERRORS OF IMMEDIATE DEATH HAD NOW GIVEN THEM AN ADVANTAGE OVER THEIR ENEMY FLOCKED ABOUT HIM AND INSULTED OVER HIS FALLEN FORTUNES
AND IN HIS WAY SAT DOWN BEFORE LEICESTER A GARRISON OF THE PARLIAMENTS
HE HAD EXPERIENCED THE EXTREME RIGOR OF THE PARLIAMENT
AND AS THE INDEPENDENTS WENT A NOTE HIGHER THAN THE PRESBYTERIANS THEY COULD LESS BE RESTRAINED WITHIN ANY BOUNDS OF TEMPER AND MODERATION
AND LIVING IN AN INDEPENDENT MANNER HE ADDICTED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO LITERARY OCCUPATIONS AND AMUSEMENTS
THESE WERE THE GRIEVANCES COMPLAINED OF AND AGAINST THESE AN ETERNAL REMEDY WAS TO BE PROVIDED
THEY NEXT PROCEEDED TO EXAMINE THE HUMBLE PETITION AND ADVICE
THE KING IS MUCH CHANGED SAID THE EARL OF SALISBURY TO SIR PHILIP WARWICK
THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS OF WHOM THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WERE THE EARL OF ROTHES AND LORD LOUDON FOUND EVERY ADVANTAGE IN CONDUCTING THEIR TREATY
AND TIME MIGHT EASILY ENABLE THEM TO RESIST THAT VIOLENCE WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED
THE COMMONS AS YET HAD NOWISE INVADED HIS AUTHORITY
THE HOUSE AFTER HAVING VOTED UPON SOME QUERIES OF DR TURNER'S THAT COMMON FAME WAS A SUFFICIENT GROUND OF ACCUSATION BY THE COMMONS PROCEEDED TO FRAME REGULAR ARTICLES AGAINST BUCKINGHAM
THEY SENT ORDERS TO GORING GOVERNOR OF PORTSMOUTH TO OBEY NO COMMANDS BUT SUCH AS HE SHOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PARLIAMENT
THEIR ILL HUMOR HAD BEEN SO MUCH IRRITATED BY THE KING'S FREQUENT EVASIONS AND DELAYS THAT IT COULD NOT BE PRESENTLY APPEASED BY AN ASSENT WHICH HE ALLOWED TO BE SO RELUCTANTLY EXTORTED FROM HIM
THE LAW WAS PRETENDED TO BE OBSOLETE
HIS HAIR WAS BECOME ALMOST ENTIRELY GRAY EITHER FROM THE DECLINE OF YEARS OR FROM THAT LOAD OF SORROWS UNDER WHICH HE LABORED
THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ACCEPT OF THE CONDITIONS OFFERED
HIS TREATISE OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IS FURTHER EMBELLISHED BY THAT WARMTH AND SPIRIT WHICH SO NATURALLY ACCOMPANY THE GENIUS OF INVENTION
NOR HAD HE OTHER AFFLICTION THAN TO SEE THE AUTHORITY OF HIS PRINCE WITH WHICH HE WAS INVESTED TREATED WITH SO MUCH IGNOMINY
AND WAS HIGHLY PLEASED THAT WITH A ROMAN ARROGANCE HE COULD CHECK THE PROGRESS OF ROYAL VICTORIES AND DISPLAY IN SO SIGNAL A MANNER THE SUPERIORITY OF FREEDOM ABOVE TYRANNY
BUT HIS CHIEF MOTIVES WERE DERIVED FROM PRINCIPLES OF ZEAL AND CONSCIENCE
OTHERS HOPED THAT THE WAR WOULD FURNISH A REASON FOR MAINTAINING SOME TIME LONGER THAT NUMEROUS STANDING ARMY WHICH WAS SO MUCH COMPLAINED OF THURLOE VOL
ILLEGAL COURTS ERECTED
BUT SOON FOUND HOW INCOMPATIBLE LIBERTY IS WITH MILITARY USURPATIONS
THAT BY THIS HYPOCRISY HE MIGHT LOSE THE ROYALISTS WHO ALONE WERE SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HIM

SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE THAT HIS WIFE OR RELATIONS OR COMPANIONS WERE PAPISTS THOUGH HE HIMSELF WERE A CONFORMIST IT IS REMARKABLE THAT PERSECUTION WAS HERE CHIEFLY PUSHED ON BY LAYMEN
SOME WERE EVEN ACTIVE IN ENCOURAGING THEIR NEIGHBORS TO INSIST UPON THEIR COMMON RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES

GREAT NUMBERS WERE THROWN INTO PRISON
DURING THE VARIETY OF RIDICULOUS AND DISTRACTED SCENES WHICH THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT EXHIBITED IN ENGLAND THE MILITARY FORCE WAS EXERTED WITH VIGOR CONDUCT AND UNANIMITY
THEY THEN OPENLY ASSERTED THAT THE LEVYING OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT WAS A PALPABLE VIOLATION OF THE ANCIENT LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE AND AN OPEN INFRINGEMENT OF THE PETITION OF RIGHT SO LATELY GRANTED THE KING IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE FINISHING AND PRESENTING THIS REMONSTRANCE CAME SUDDENLY TO THE PARLIAMENT AND ENDED THIS SESSION BY A PROROGATION RUSHWORTH VOL

TO WHICH A DEMAND WAS ADDED THAT NO OFFICER SHOULD BE DISMISSED FROM HIS COMMAND BUT BY A COURT MARTIAL

BY THE CONTAGIOUS FERMENT OF HIS ZEAL HE ENGAGED EVERY ONE TO COOEPERATE WITH HIM IN HIS MEASURES
THE WALLS AND FLOOR AND ROOF OF THE FABRIC WERE THEN SUPPOSED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY HOLY ORDERS WERE GIVEN AND RIGOROUSLY INSISTED ON THAT THE COMMUNION TABLE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE AREA WHERE IT HITHERTO STOOD IN ALL CHURCHES EXCEPT IN CATHEDRALS IT WAS PLACED AT THE EAST END RAILED IN AND DENOMINATED AN ALTAR AS THE CLERGYMAN WHO OFFICIATED RECEIVED COMMONLY THE APPELLATION OF PRIEST IT IS NOT EASY TO IMAGINE THE DISCONTENTS EXCITED BY THIS INNOVATION AND THE SUSPICIONS WHICH IT GAVE RISE TO
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CAMPAIGN CHARLES APPREHENSIVE OF THE EVENT HAD SENT THE PRINCE OF WALES THEN FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO THE WEST WITH THE TITLE OF GENERAL AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS IF HE WERE PRESSED BY THE ENEMY THAT HE SHOULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND SAVE ONE PART OF THE ROYAL FAMILY FROM THE VIOLENCE OF THE PARLIAMENT
HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
THAT HIS IMPERIOUS CHARACTER WHICH HAD BETRAYED ITSELF IN SO MANY INCIDENTS COULD NEVER SERIOUSLY SUBMIT TO LEGAL LIMITATIONS
359 THEIR BILL FOR TAKING AWAY THE BISHOPS VOTES HAD LAST WINTER BEEN REJECTED BY THE PEERS
THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON BRADOC DOWN
THE STANDING ARMY OF IRELAND WAS USUALLY ABOUT THREE THOUSAND MEN
AND EXHORTED HIM TO SAVE HIMSELF AND THEM FROM THAT IGNOMINIOUS SLAVERY WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED
A NUMBER OF THEM FANCIED THAT THE RENOVATION OF ALL THINGS HAD COMMENCED AND THAT CLOTHES WERE TO BE REJECTED TOGETHER WITH OTHER SUPERFLUITIES
WHEN HE ADVANCED TO DRAITON IN SHROPSHIRE BIRON MET HIM AND BROUGHT INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS APPROACH HAD RAISED THE SIEGE AND THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY HAD WITHDRAWN
HIS INGRATITUDE TO THE KING AND HIS FREQUENT CHANGING OF SIDES WERE REGARDED AS GREAT STAINS ON HIS MEMORY
O UNWISE FOREFATHERS
YET GREAT CLAMOR PREVAILED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS ACT OF HOSTILITY
AS MUCH AS ANY MAN WHOM WE MEET WITH IN HISTORY
WHICH PROHIBITED ALL NATIONS FROM IMPORTING INTO ENGLAND IN THEIR BOTTOMS ANY COMMODITY WHICH WAS NOT THE GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE KING'S RETURN TO ENGLAND HE HEARD OF ARCHBISHOP ABBOT'S DEATH
HE APPROACHED AGAIN
AND THESE WERE NOW FOUND UNITED IN THE SAME USURPED AND ILLEGAL ADMINISTRATION
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS NARROW REVENUE AND HIS FREEDOM FROM ALL VANITY HE LIVED IN SUCH MAGNIFICENCE THAT HE POSSESSED FOUR AND TWENTY PALACES ALL OF THEM ELEGANTLY AND COMPLETELY FURNISHED
THE SENTENCE WHICH HAD BEEN EXECUTED AGAINST PRYNNE BASTWIC AND BURTON NOW SUFFERED A REVISAL FROM PARLIAMENT
OUR ANCIENT LEGAL AND VITAL LIBERTIES
I AM WEARY SUBJOINED HE OF THE TIMES AND FORESEE MUCH MISERY TO MY COUNTRY

BUCKINGHAM HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SOUBIZE AND OTHER FRENCH GENTLEMEN

AND NO MAN WAS SO REMOTE FROM PARTY SO INDIFFERENT TO PUBLIC GOOD AS NOT TO FEEL THE MOST ARDENT WISHES FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THAT TYRANNY WHICH WHETHER THE CIVIL OR THE MILITARY PART OF IT WERE CONSIDERED APPEARED EQUALLY OPPRESSIVE AND RUINOUS TO THE NATION

THEREFORE I CHARGE THEE DO NOT BE MADE A KING BY THEM THE DUKE SIGHING REPLIED I WILL BE TORN IN PIECES FIRST SO DETERMINED AN ANSWER FROM ONE OF SUCH TENDER YEARS FILLED THE KING'S EYES WITH TEARS OF JOY AND ADMIRATION
SINCE EVEN AT PRESENT SOME MEN OF SENSE AND KNOWLEDGE ARE DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE JUSTICE OF THE QUAR REL MAY BE REGARDED AS DOUBTFUL AND UNCERTAIN
AND HAD HE NOT HIMSELF BEEN SUDDENLY PREVENTED BY THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE COMMONS HE HAD THAT VERY DAY IT WAS THOUGHT CHARGED PYM HAMBDEN AND OTHERS WITH TREASON FOR HAVING INVITED THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
WHERE BOTH HOUSES SAT THE ONE AS ACCUSERS THE OTHER AS JUDGES
THE KING AFTERWARDS COPIED FROM THIS EXAMPLE
AND THE POPULACE WHO FIRST OPPOSED THE SERVICE WAS OFTEN COMPARED TO BALAAM'S ASS AN ANIMAL IN ITSELF STUPID AND SENSELESS BUT WHOSE MOUTH HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE LORD TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE WORLD
THE GATES OF THAT CITY THOUGH TIMOROUSLY OPENED RECEIVED THE WRETCHED SUPPLICANTS AND PRESENTED TO THE VIEW A SCENE OF HUMAN MISERY BEYOND WHAT ANY EYE HAD EVER BEFORE BEHELD COMPASSION SEIZED THE AMAZED INHABITANTS AGGRAVATED WITH THE FEAR OF LIKE CALAMITIES
THESE FORMS OF EXPRESSION ARE AMUSING TO POSTERITY WHO CONSIDER HOW OBSCURE WHITLOCKE HIMSELF THOUGH LORD-KEEPER AND AMBASSADOR AND INDEED A MAN OF GREAT ABILITIES AND MERIT HAS BECOME IN COMPARISON OF MILTON
FAIRFAX HAVING ROUTED THE KENTISH ROYALISTS AT MAIDSTONE FOLLOWED THE BROKEN ARMY
SO MUCH HAD ANIMOSITIES INCREASED BETWEEN THE PARTIES CROMWELL BEING A MEMBER OF THE LOWER HOUSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCARDED WITH THE OTHERS

THEN I AM SAFE SAID THE PROTECTOR
ONE DIVISION WAS COMMANDED BY LORD MOHUN AND SIR RALPH HOPTON ANOTHER BY SIR BEVIL GRANVILLE AND SIR JOHN BERKELEY A THIRD BY SLANNING AND TREVANNION A FOURTH BY BASSET AND GODOLPHIN

HENRY DUKE OF GLOUCESTER BORN IN 1641;--AND THREE FEMALES
1655 WERE WE TO JUDGE OF CROMWELL'S CAPACITY BY THIS AND INDEED BY ALL HIS OTHER COMPOSITIONS WE SHOULD BE APT TO ENTERTAIN NO VERY FAVORABLE IDEA OF IT
ABOUT THIS TIME THERE CAME SIX SOLDIERS INTO THE PARISH CHURCH OF WALTON UPON THAMES NEAR TWILIGHT
AND WAS RESOLVED NOT TO TOLERATE MUCH LESS TO COUNTENANCE ANY OF THEM IN ANY OF HIS DOMINIONS
YOU WILL BE PLEASED TO PARDON MY INFIRMITY
BUT THIS DISTEMPER WAS SOON CURED BY THE ROUGH BUT DEXTEROUS HAND OF CROMWELL
THE HIERARCHY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ENGLAND EVER SINCE THE REFORMATION
AND BY THESE PRECIPITATE COUNSELS AT ONCE SEEMED TO EVINCE HIS OWN SINCERITY AND INFLAMED THOSE DISCONTENTS OF WHICH HE INTENDED TO MAKE ADVANTAGE

HENRY THE DEPUTY OF IRELAND WAS ENDOWED WITH THE SAME MODERATE DISPOSITION AS RICHARD
AND THE PARLIAMENTARY GENERALS AFTER ENDURING GREAT LOSSES AND FATIGUES FLATTERED THEMSELVES THAT ALL THEIR LABORS WOULD AT LAST BE CROWNED BY THIS IMPORTANT CONQUEST
IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED THAT EXCEPT A FEW COURTIERS OR ECCLESIASTICS ALL MEN WERE DISPLEASED WITH THIS HIGH EXERTION OF PREROGATIVE AND THIS NEW SPIRIT OF ADMINISTRATION
THE LORDS CONCURRED IN THE SAME ORDINANCE BY THIS VOTE OF NON-ADDRESSES,--SO IT WAS CALLED,--THE KING WAS IN REALITY DETHRONED AND THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION FORMALLY OVERTHROWN
AND AS ALL THOSE PRELATES OBNOXIOUS TO THE COMMONS WERE REGARDED AS HIS CHIEF FRIENDS AND MOST FAVORED COURTIERS HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO DISARM AND DISHONOR HIMSELF BY ABANDONING THEM TO THE RESENTMENT OF HIS ENEMIES
THE OTHER ARTICLES WERE IN THE MAIN THE SAME AS IN THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT
THE TOWN COUNCIL MET WITH THE SAME FATE
WHEN NEWS CAME OF THEIR ADVANCING THE CRY OF TREAT AND CAPITULATE WAS NO LESS LOUD AND VEHEMENT THE TERROR OF A UNIVERSAL PILLAGE AND EVEN MASSACRE HAD SEIZED THE TIMID INHABITANTS
THOUGH THEY ACTED SO CAUTIOUSLY AS TO GIVE THE PROTECTOR NO HANDLE AGAINST THEM
AND SOME EXPRESSED IN HIS HEARING THEIR EARNEST WISHES OF SEIZING HIM
MAY BOOK III
MAY BOOK III
MAY BOOK III
HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED OF THE SOLIDITY OF THESE REASONS
IN THE WHOLE THIRTY-THREE
NOR COULD ANY OF THAT PARTY RECOVER TRUST OR EVEN LIVE IN SAFETY BUT BY DOING SOLEMN AND PUBLIC PENANCE FOR TAKING ARMS BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT IN DEFENCE OF THEIR LAWFUL SOVEREIGN
SEVENTEEN SHIPS LYING IN THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER DECLARED FOR THE KING
THE SCOTTISH ZEALOTS WHEN PRELACY WAS ABJURED DEEMED THIS EXPRESSION QUITE FREE FROM AMBIGUITY AND REGARDED THEIR OWN MODEL AS THE ONLY ONE WHICH CORRESPONDED IN ANY DEGREE TO SUCH A DESCRIPTION
THESE COULD SEQUESTER FINE IMPRISON AND CORPORALLY PUNISH WITHOUT LAW OR REMEDY
IF HE RESTORE YOU TO YOUR RIGHT ON HARD CONDITIONS WHATEVER YOU PROMISE KEEP THESE MEN WHO HAVE VIOLATED LAWS WHICH THEY WERE BOUND TO PRESERVE WILL FIND THEIR TRIUMPHS FULL OF TROUBLE
V MAY P
THE VIOLENCE OF THE ENGLISH PARTIES EXCEEDED ANY THING WHICH WE CAN NOW IMAGINE
THE PRESBYTERIANS WHOSE CREDIT HAD FIRST SUPPORTED THE ARMS OF THE PARLIAMENT WERE ENRAGED TO FIND THAT BY THE TREACHERY OR SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THEN ASSOCIATES THE FRUITS OF ALL THEIR SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RAVISHED FROM THEM
AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME DISCOURAGEMENTS VERY MUCH WRESTLING OF FAITH FOR YOU WHICH ARE TO US AND I TRUST WILL BE TO YOU MATTER OF GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT
THEY DESIRED HIM IN RETURN TO DISMISS HIS FORCES TO RESIDE WITH HIS PARLIAMENT AND TO GIVE UP DELINQUENTS TO THEIR JUSTICE
THE WHOLE KINGDOM WAS SHAKEN WITH THESE REPEATED SUCCESSES OF MONTROSE
COLONEL MONTGOMERY WITH A TROOP OF HORSE WAS SENT IN PURSUIT OF HIM
BUT SEEING THESE UNFORTUNATE WOMEN ASTONISHED WITH THE DANGER FALL IN A SWOON AND PERISH IN THE FLAMES HE RATHER CHOSE TO DIE WITH THEM THAN DRAG OUT A LIFE IMBITTERED WITH THE REMEMBRANCE OF SUCH DISMAL SCENES WHEN THE TREASURES GAINED BY THIS ENTERPRISE ARRIVED AT PORTSMOUTH THE PROTECTOR FROM A SPIRIT OF OSTENTATION ORDERED THEM TO BE TRANSPORTED BY LAND TO LONDON
AND SOME OF THEM AFTERWARDS WHEN MATTERS WERE PUSHED TO EXTREMITIES BY THE COMMONS PROVED THE GREATEST SUPPORT OF MONARCHY
191
THAT OF SIX OTHER COUNSELLORS PRESENT LAUD AND WINDEBANK COULD GIVE NO EVIDENCE
IT IS SAID THAT HE HAD SAVED DAVENANT'S LIFE DURING THE PROTECTORSHIP
HE WAS TRIED BY A JURY
THE REST OF HIS THOUSAND PAGES IS OF A LIKE STRAIN
AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
SOME OF THEM WERE DISGUSTED
4 NO SOONER WERE THE IRISH LANDED THOUGH NOT EXCEEDING ELEVEN HUNDRED FOOT VERY ILL ARMED THAN MONTROSE DECLARED HIMSELF AND ENTERED UPON THAT SCENE OF ACTION WHICH HAS RENDERED HIS NAME SO CELEBRATED
OR IF THAT DID NOT SUFFICE THE SIXTH FOR THE PAYMENT OF PUBLIC DEBTS

IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MILTON NEVER ENJOYED IN HIS LIFETIME THE REPUTATION WHICH HE DESERVED

CLARENDON P
ATTENDED ONLY BY SIR JOHN BERKELEY ASHBURNHAM AND LEG HE PRIVATELY LEFT HAMPTON COURT
AND THAT WITH REGARD TO THESE PARTICULARS THERE WAS RESERVED TO HIM A NEGATIVE VOICE
NEWCASTLE'S REGIMENT ALONE RESOLUTE TO CONQUER OR TO PERISH OBSTINATELY KEPT THEIR GROUND AND MAINTAINED BY THEIR DEAD BODIES THE SAME ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAD AT FIRST BEEN RANGED
BUT HE ABANDONED THE POWER ASSUMED IN THE INTERVALS OF PARLIAMENT OF FRAMING LAWS WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS COUNCIL
FOR WHO CAN LOVE TO WALK IN THE DARK
NOR WERE THEY INFLAMED WITH THAT VIOLENT ANIMOSITY AGAINST HIM WHICH ATTENDS ALL CIVIL COMMOTIONS
ANOTHER ACT OF SEVERITY BUT NECESSARY IN HIS SITUATION WAS AT THE VERY SAME TIME EXERCISED BY THE PROTECTOR IN THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OF GERARD AND VOWEL TWO ROYALISTS WHO WERE ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING AGAINST HIS LIFE

BUT INFORMATION BEING BROUGHT THAT THE MOST ACTIVE OFFICERS AND AGITATORS WERE ENTIRELY HIS CREATURES THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS SECRETLY RESOLVED THAT NEXT DAY WHEN HE SHOULD COME TO THE HOUSE AN ACCUSATION SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST HIM AND HE SHOULD BE SENT TO THE TOWER CROMWELL WHO IN THE CONDUCT OF HIS DESPERATE ENTERPRISES FREQUENTLY APPROACHED TO THE VERY BRINK OF DESTRUCTION KNEW HOW TO MAKE THE REQUISITE TURN WITH PROPER DEXTERITY AND BOLDNESS
FROM THE MEMORABLE REVOLUTIONS WHICH PASSED IN ENGLAND DURING THIS PERIOD WE MAY NATURALLY DEDUCE THE SAME USEFUL LESSON WHICH CHARLES HIMSELF IN HIS LATER YEARS INFERRED
AND THE PRINCE SAT UPON IT ANXIOUSLY AND PRECARIOUSLY
THESE MEN UNITING THEMSELVES TO THE ENTHUSIASTS WHOSE GENIUS IS NATURALLY AVERSE TO CLERICAL USURPATIONS EXERCISED SO JEALOUS AN AUTHORITY OVER THE ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES THAT THEY ALLOWED THEM NOTHING BUT THE LIBERTY OF TENDERING ADVICE AND WOULD NOT INTRUST THEM EVEN WITH THE POWER OF ELECTING THEIR OWN CHAIRMAN OR HIS SUBSTITUTE OR OF SUPPLYING THE VACANCIES OF THEIR OWN MEMBERS
YET WAS THERE SUCH A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE IN THE COMPLAINTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS THAT THE ENGLISH READILY ASSENTED TO ALL THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SCOTTISH MALECONTENTS AND BELIEVED THAT NATION TO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY OPPRESSION INTO THE VIOLENT COUNSELS WHICH THEY HAD EMBRACED
WE CANNOT YET SPARE THE SCOTS SAID STRODE PLAINLY IN THE HOUSE THE SONS OF ZERUIAH ARE STILL TOO STRONG FOR US AN ALLUSION TO A PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF THAT AGE
THE MOST FURIOUS OF ALL RANKS WERE CHOSEN
AND BY THE INFIDELITY OF SOME ABOUT THAT PRINCE,--HAMILTON AS WAS SUSPECTED,--A COPY OF THIS LETTER WAS SENT TO LEVEN THE SCOTTISH GENERAL
AND THE MALECONTENTS WERE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SUBDUE ALL IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD WHO VENTURED TO OPPOSE THEM
AND INTRODUCING ART AND INDUSTRY AMONG THEM TO CURE THEM OF THAT SLOTH AND BARBARISM TO WHICH THEY HAD EVER BEEN SUBJECT
AND SCOTLAND WHENCE THE KING'S CAUSE HAD RECEIVED THE FIRST FATAL DISASTER SEEMED NOW TO PROMISE IT SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE
THE PARLIAMENT FINDING THAT THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD OF COMING TO ANY AGREEMENT SUDDENLY RECALLED THEIR COMMISSIONERS
EVEN THE ROYAL PALACES WERE PULLED IN PIECES AND THE MATERIALS OF THEM SOLD
AND IF THE SECRETARY HIMSELF AS WAS BY FAR MOST PROBABLE HAD WILLINGLY DELIVERED TO HIS SON THIS PAPER OF NOTES TO BE COMMUNICATED TO PYM THIS IMPLIED SUCH A BREACH OF OATHS AND OF TRUST AS RENDERED HIM TOTALLY UNWORTHY OF ALL CREDIT
SOON AFTER ON THE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER THAT VERY DAY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED AS THE MOST FORTUNATE FOR HIM HE EXPIRED A VIOLENT TEMPEST WHICH IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED HIS DEATH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE TO THE VULGAR
AND EVEN SECURED IT BY A RULE WHICH THOUGH VULGARLY RECEIVED SEEMS IN THE EXECUTION IMPRACTICABLE
AND HE CAST HIS EYE TOWARDS IRELAND IN HOPES THAT THIS KINGDOM FROM WHICH HIS CAUSE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED SO MUCH PREJUDICE MIGHT AT LENGTH CONTRIBUTE SOMEWHAT TOWARDS HIS PROTECTION AND SECURITY
AND BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN FOUND NECESSARY TO EXECUTE A MUTINEER THE GENERALS THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY TO APPLY FOR A PARDON FROM THE CROWN
BUT THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS THOUGH IN THE BEGINNING LESS POSITIVE AND DETERMINATE ARE NO LESS DISCERNIBLE BY GOOD JUDGES AND WERE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF DESTROYING THE JUST BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
ALL THE SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA EXCEPT NEW ENGLAND WHICH HAD BEEN PLANTED ENTIRELY BY THE PURITANS ADHERED TO THE ROYAL PARTY EVEN AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE REPUBLIC
A PARTY LIKEWISE WHO FOUND THEMSELVES ECLIPSED IN RICHARD'S FAVOR SYDENHAM KELSEY BERRY HAINES JOINED THE CABAL OF THE OTHERS
AND THAT A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS BE LEVIED ON THE BISHOPS ESTATES AND THE CHAPTER LANDS FOR PAYMENT OF DEBTS CONTRACTED BY THE PARLIAMENT DUGDALE P
HE NOT ONLY FOUND HIMSELF A PRISONER VERY STRICTLY GUARDED
WHEN SIR RALPH HOPTON WITH HIS SMALL TROOP RETIRED INTO CORNWALL BEFORE THE EARL OF BEDFORD THAT NOBLEMAN DESPISING SO INCONSIDERABLE A FORCE ABANDONED THE PURSUIT AND COMMITTED THE CARE OF SUPPRESSING THE ROYAL PARTY TO THE SHERIFFS OF THE COUNTY

AND TO THIS TOWN BIRON LAID SIEGE DURING THE DEPTH OF WINTER
WHICHEVER SIDE PREVAILS SHE CAN SCARCELY HOPE TO REMAIN INVIOLATE AND MAY SUFFER NO LESS OR RATHER GREATER INJURIES FROM THE BOUNDLESS PRETENSIONS OF FORCES ENGAGED IN HER CAUSE THAN FROM THE INVASION OF ENRAGED TROOPS ENLISTED ON THE SIDE OF MONARCHY
STRAFFORD WAS OBLIGED TO SPEAK WITH DEFERENCE AND RESERVE TOWARDS HIS MOST INVETERATE ENEMIES THE COMMONS THE SCOTTISH NATION AND THE IRISH PARLIAMENT
THE MILITARY GENIUS OF THE PEOPLE HAD BY THE CIVIL CONTESTS BEEN ROUSED FROM ITS FORMER LETHARGY
AN INCONTESTABLE MAJORITY NOW DECLARED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE PROTECTOR
TO MAKE THE ATTACK ON ROYAL AUTHORITY BY REGULAR APPROACHES IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER TO FRAME A GENERAL REMONSTRANCE OF THE STATE OF THE NATION
THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER
SEEING EVERY PROSPECT BLASTED FACTION TRIUMPHANT THE DISCONTENTED POPULACE INFLAMED TO A DEGREE OF FURY THEY UTTERLY DESPAIRED OF SUCCESS IN A CAUSE TO WHOSE RUIN FRIENDS AND ENEMIES SEEMED EQUALLY TO CONSPIRE
I OWN HOWEVER THAT IT IS VERY QUESTIONABLE WHETHER PERSECUTION CAN IN ANY CASE BE JUSTIFIED
THE KING CONTINUED SEVERAL DAYS IN WINDHAM'S HOUSE
THESE WHIMSEYS MINGLING WITH PRIDE HAD SO CORRUPTED HIS EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE PERSON DEPUTED TO REIGN ON EARTH FOR A THOUSAND YEARS OVER THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE FAITHFUL CLARENDON
ALSO STUBBE P
AND THOUGH ALL THESE GRIEVANCES HAD BEEN ALREADY REDRESSED AND EVEN LAWS ENACTED FOR FUTURE SECURITY AGAINST THEIR RETURN THE PRAISE OF THESE ADVANTAGES WAS ASCRIBED NOT TO THE KING BUT TO THE PARLIAMENT WHO HAD EXTORTED HIS CONSENT TO SUCH SALUTARY STATUTES
AND THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY PROCEEDED UPON BUSINESS
THEY FRAMED THE FAMOUS ACT OF NAVIGATION
HE LAY FIVE DAYS AT TEWKESBURY WHICH WAS HIS FIRST STAGE AFTER LEAVING GLOUCESTER
NOBILITY MUST BE SET ASIDE
AND IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT A MAN OF SUCH SPIRIT WHO CONDUCTED HIS ENTERPRISES WITH SO MUCH WARMTH AND INDUSTRY HAD NOT ENTERTAINED MORE ENLARGED VIEWS AND EMBRACED PRINCIPLES MORE FAVORABLE TO THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF SOCIETY
WE MIGHT ASCRIBE THIS STEP TO A NOBLE EFFORT OF DISINTERESTEDNESS NOT UNWORTHY THE GREAT MIND OF STRAFFORD IF THE MEASURE WHICH HE ADVISED HAD NOT BEEN IN THE EVENT AS PERNICIOUS TO HIS MASTER AS IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FATAL TO HIMSELF 6 WHITLOCKE P
PEN AND VENABLES WERE OF INCOMPATIBLE TEMPERS
PENRUDDOC GROVES JONES AND OTHER GENTLEMEN OF THE WEST ENTERED SALISBURY WITH ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HORSE AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THE SHERIFF AND JUDGES WERE HOLDING THE ASSIZES
MEMOIRES DE MAD
HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES
NOT ONLY HIS CAUSE WAS MORE FAVORABLE AS SUPPORTING THE ANCIENT GOVERNMENT IN CHURCH AND STATE AGAINST THE MOST ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS
AS NO CONSIDERABLE SYMPTOMS OF DISCONTENT APPEARED THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY MIGHT SAFELY PROCEED IN THEIR PURPOSE
BUT THESE LAWS HAD LESS AUTHORITY WITH THE NATION AS THEY WERE KNOWN TO HAVE PASSED CONTRARY TO THE SENTIMENTS EVEN OF THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THEM AND WERE IN REALITY EXTORTED BY THE AUTHORITY AND IMPORTUNITY OF THE SOVEREIGN
MONTAGUE HAD NOT WAITED FOR ORDERS FROM THE PARLIAMENT
BUT HOWEVER NATURAL ALL THESE SENTIMENTS MIGHT APPEAR TO THE COUNTRY PARTY IT IS NOT TO BE IMAGINED THAT CHARLES WOULD ENTERTAIN THE SAME IDEAS
TO THE MAKING WHOLE ALL THESE BREACHES I SHALL APPLY MYSELF AND TO ALL THESE DISEASES SHALL PROPOUND A REMEDY
BUT IN THE PRESENT PRECARIOUS SITUATION OF AFFAIRS WHAT SECURITY CAN BE GIVEN US FOR OUR MONEY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT WAS LAID ASIDE BY TACIT CONSENT
AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIES THESE WORDS WERE RECITED TO THE KING
DRESS TOO A MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE DISTINGUISHED THE MEMBERS OF THIS SECT
THIS WAS A DEVICE FALLEN UPON BY THE RULING PARTY IN ORDER AS THEY SAID TO REACH HEART MALIGNANTS NEVER IN THIS ISLAND WAS KNOWN A MORE SEVERE AND ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT THAN WAS GENERALLY EXERCISED BY THE PATRONS OF LIBERTY IN BOTH KINGDOMS
NO SOONER HAD THE GENERAL LEISURE TO REFLECT THAN HE FOUND THAT THIS LAST MEASURE INSTEAD OF BEING A CONTINUATION OF THAT CAUTIOUS AMBIGUITY WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO MAINTAINED WAS TAKING PARTY WITHOUT RESERVE AND LAYING HIMSELF AS WELL AS THE NATION AT THE MERCY OF THAT TYRANNICAL PARLIAMENT WHOSE POWER AND LONG BEEN ODIOUS AS THEIR PERSONS CONTEMPTIBLE TO ALL MEN
BY DAVID HUME ESQ
ON THURSDAY THE 30TH AND LAST DAY OF THIS INSTANT JUNE 1625 I WENT TO WHITEHALL PURPOSELY TO SEE THE QUEEN WHICH I DID FULLY ALL THE TIME SHE SAT AT DINNER
TALL HANDSOME AND WELL ACCOUTRED
FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THIS PARLIAMENTARY LIBERTY IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT MUST BE LEFT UNBOUNDED BY LAW
5TH JULY 1625
AND HE RETURNED TO ENGLAND HAVING LOST TWO THIRDS OF HIS LAND FORCES
IN ONE PLACE ALONE THE CONSPIRACY BROKE INTO ACTION
ALL THE NECESSITIES OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING THE DIFFICULTIES BY WHICH THE KING HAD BEEN INDUCED TO USE VIOLENT EXPEDIENTS FOR RAISING SUPPLY WERE THE RESULT OF MEASURES PREVIOUS TO STRAFFORD'S FAVOR
734

THEY HAD ONLY EXERCISED AS BEST PLEASED THEM THEIR OWN PRIVILEGES
THOUGH IN THEIR ULTIMATE VIEWS AND INTENTIONS THESE MEN DIFFERED WIDELY FROM THE FORMER IN THEIR PRESENT ACTIONS AND DISCOURSES AN ENTIRE CONCURRENCE AND UNANIMITY WAS OBSERVED
364
RUN ASIDE SOMETIMES FROM YOUR COMPANY AND GET A WORD WITH THE LORD
THE MARQUIS HIMSELF MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED
AND THE NIGHT CAME VERY SEASONABLY TO THEIR RELIEF AND PREVENTED A TOTAL OVERTHROW
AND THEN SAID A FORM OF PRAYER WHICH CONCLUDED WITH THESE WORDS
BUT WERE WE TO LOOK FOR THE CAUSE OF THESE VIOLENCES WE SHOULD NEVER FIND IT TO CONSIST IN THE WANTON TYRANNY AND INJUSTICE OF THE PRINCE NOT EVEN IN HIS AMBITION OR IMMODERATE APPETITE FOR AUTHORITY
AND HIS TEMPER CHEERFUL CARELESS AND SOCIABLE WAS MORE THAN A SUFFICIENT COMPENSATION FOR THAT EMPIRE OF WHICH HIS ENEMIES HAD BEREAVED HIM
IMMEDIATELY AFTER STRAFFORD WAS SEQUESTERED FROM PARLIAMENT AND CONFINED IN THE TOWER A COMMITTEE OF THIRTEEN WAS CHOSEN BY THE LOWER HOUSE AND INTRUSTED WITH THE OFFICE OF PREPARING A CHARGE AGAINST HIM
HE URGED TOO THAT FELTON SHOULD BE PUT TO THE QUESTION IN ORDER TO EXTORT FROM HIM A DISCOVERY OF HIS ACCOMPLICES
THE COVENANT WAS HER PERPETUAL THEME
THAT NOBLEMAN THEREFORE WITH SIR JOHN COLEPEPER AND SIR WILLIAM UVEDALE WAS DESPATCHED TO LONDON WITH OFFERS OF A TREATY CLARENDON VOL
AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT PLEASURE THAT THEY LEARNED THE DISSOLUTION OF THAT HAUGHTY ASSEMBLY BY THE VIOLENCE OF CROMWELL
AND THE NATION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE SAME SITUATION WHICH THE PARLIAMENT HAD EVER SUPPOSED WHEN THEY SO MUCH HARASSED THEIR SOVEREIGN BY THEIR IMPATIENT IMPORTUNATE AND EVEN UNDUTIFUL SOLICITATIONS
THE COURT OF ROME ITSELF ENTERTAINED HOPES OF REGAINING ITS AUTHORITY IN THIS ISLAND
AS SOON AS SPAIN DECLARED WAR AGAINST HIM HE CONCLUDED A PEACE AND AN ALLIANCE WITH FRANCE AND UNITED HIMSELF IN ALL HIS COUNSELS WITH THAT POTENT AND AMBITIOUS KINGDOM
PRINCE RUPERT WHO COMMANDED THE RIGHT WING OF THE ROYALISTS WAS OPPOSED TO CROMWELL WHO CONDUCTED THE CHOICE TROOPS OF THE PARLIAMENT INURED TO DANGER UNDER THAT DETERMINED LEADER ANIMATED BY ZEAL AND CONFIRMED BY THE MOST RIGID DISCIPLINE
ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE IN ASCRIBING TO CROMWELL A TIRESOME DARK UNINTELLIGIBLE ELOCUTION EVEN WHEN HE HAD NO INTENTION TO DISGUISE HIS MEANING
IT CONSISTED OF EIGHTY VESSELS GREAT AND SMALL
SO HIGH AN IDEA HAD HE RECEIVED OF KINGLY PREROGATIVE AND SO CONTEMPTIBLE A NOTION OF THE RIGHTS OF THOSE POPULAR ASSEMBLIES FROM WHICH HE VERY NATURALLY THOUGHT HE HAD MET WITH SUCH ILL USAGE
A TOLERATION WAS STILL CONTINUED TO THEM
ABOUT EIGHTY PEERS HAD CONSTANTLY ATTENDED STRAFFORD'S TRIAL
GIVE PLACE TO HONESTER MEN
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS DECISION WHICH WAS MEANT ONLY TO DEPRIVE STRAFFORD OF SO MANY FRIENDS LORD SEYMOUR AND SOME OTHERS STILL CONTINUED TO KEEP THEIR SEAT
HE HAD LEFT A CONSIDERABLE SUM IN THE EXCHEQUER
THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT
A CONFIDENCE IN HIS PROMISES SHAMEFUL PROSTITUTION

THIS LETTER WHICH HAD IT BEEN SAFELY DELIVERED HAD PROBABLY PREVENTED THE BATTLE OF NASEBY SERVED NOW TO DIRECT THE OPERATIONS OF FAIRFAX AFTER LEAVING A BODY OF THREE THOUSAND MEN TO POINTZ AND ROSSITER WITH ORDERS TO ATTEND THE KING'S MOTIONS HE MARCHED IMMEDIATELY TO THE WEST WITH A VIEW OF SAVING TAUNTON AND SUPPRESSING THE ONLY CONSIDERABLE FORCE WHICH NOW REMAINED TO THE ROYALISTS
IN MANY COUNTIES A RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN TO RISE IN ARMS
AND IS EVEN REQUISITE TO THE SUPPORT OF LIBERTY ITSELF BY MAINTAINING THE LAWS WHICH CAN ALONE REGULATE AND PROTECT IT
MEN WHO WITHOUT BEING SUBJECTED TO EPISCOPAL AUTHORITY EMPLOYED THEMSELVES ENTIRELY IN PREACHING AND SPREADING THE FIRE OF PURITANISM
THE TRUTH IS THEY WERE INSINCERE AT FIRST
605
WHOM IT WAS FITTING THE SAINTS SHOULD FIRST EXTIRPATE ERE THEY UNDERTOOK THAT GREAT WORK TO WHICH THEY BELIEVED THEMSELVES DESTINED BY PROVIDENCE OF SUBDUING ANTICHRIST THE MAN OF SIN AND EXTENDING TO THE UTTERMOST BOUNDS OF THE EARTH THE KINGDOM OF THE REDEEMER THE AMBASSADORS FINDING THEMSELVES PROSCRIBED NOT AS ENEMIES OF ENGLAND BUT OF CHRIST REMAINED IN ASTONISHMENT AND KNEW NOT WHICH WAS MOST TO BE ADMIRED THE IMPLACABLE SPIRIT OR EGREGIOUS FOLLY OF THESE PRETENDED SAINTS
THAT THE RANK ALONE POSSESSED BY SUCH AS WERE MEMBERS OF EITHER HOUSE PREVENTED ENVY RETAINED THE ARMY IN OBEDIENCE AND GAVE WEIGHT TO MILITARY ORDERS
WORCESTER REFUSED HIM ADMITTANCE
AND THESE INSTIGATED BY THE CLERGY WERE RESOLVED SINCE THEY COULD NOT OBTAIN THE KING'S CONSENT TO SUMMON IN HIS NAME BUT BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY A CONVENTION OF STATES
AND HAD HITHERTO LIVED CONTENTEDLY IN THE COUNTRY ON A SMALL ESTATE WHICH HIS WIFE HAD BROUGHT HIM
AND BEHOLD ALL THE MEN OF ISRAEL CAME TO THE KING AND SAID UNTO HIM WHY HAVE OUR BRETHREN THE MEN OF JUDAH STOLEN THEE AWAY AND HAVE BROUGHT THE KING AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AND ALL DAVID'S MEN WITH HIM OVER JORDAN
WHITLOCKE IN PARTICULAR A MAN OF HONOR WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY THOUGH IN EVERY CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT HE ALWAYS ADHERED TO THE RULING POWER SAID THAT BESIDES THE INGRATITUDE OF DISCARDING AND THAT BY FRAUD AND ARTIFICE SO MANY NOBLE PERSONS TO WHOM THE PARLIAMENT HAD HITHERTO OWED ITS CHIEF SUPPORT THEY WOULD FIND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF MEN NOW FORMED BY EXPERIENCE TO COMMAND AND AUTHORITY
RUTHVEN WITH A FEW BROKEN TROOPS FLED TO SALTASH
I KNOW YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT SCRIPTURE HE MAKES HIS PEOPLE WILLING IN THE DAY OF HIS POWER GOD MANIFESTS IT TO BE THE DAY OF THE POWER OF CHRIST HAVING THROUGH SO MUCH BLOOD AND SO MUCH TRIAL AS HAS BEEN UPON THIS NATION HE MAKES THIS ONE OF THE GREATEST MERCIES NEXT TO HIS OWN SON TO HAVE HIS PEOPLE CALLED TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY

BARNARD LECTURER OF ST SEPULCHRE'S LONDON USED THIS EXPRESSION IN HIS PRAYER BEFORE SERMON
THE CONFERENCE LASTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
PRINCE RUPERT COMMANDED THE HORSE
THAT IN ALL HIS WARLIKE ENTERPRISES HE WAS WARRANTED BY THAT COMMISSION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS AND THEIR MASTER AGAINST WHOSE LAWFUL AUTHORITY THEY HAD ERECTED THEIR STANDARD

1637 BURTON A DIVINE AND BASTWICK A PHYSICIAN WERE TRIED IN THE STAR CHAMBER FOR SEDITIOUS AND SCHISMATICAL LIBELS AND WERE CONDEMNED TO THE SAME PUNISHMENT THAT HAD BEEN INFLICTED ON PRYNNE
FOR THIS INSTANCE OF COWARDICE FIENNES WAS AFTERWARDS TRIED BY A COURT MARTIAL AND CONDEMNED TO LOSE HIS HEAD
AND OF THIS THE PARLIAMENT COMMISSIONERS HAD EXPERIENCE TO THEIR GREAT TROUBLE
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THESE EVENTS FURNISH US WITH ANOTHER INSTRUCTION NO LESS NATURAL AND NO LESS USEFUL CONCERNING THE MADNESS OF THE PEOPLE THE FURIES OF FANATICISM AND THE DANGER OF MERCENARY ARMIES
RUSH VOL VII
BLAKE PURSUED AND CHASED HIM INTO THE TAGUS WHERE HE INTENDED TO MAKE AN ATTACK UPON HIM
AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED
THE KEEPING OF CHRISTMAS HOLYDAYS WAS LONG A GREAT MARK OF MALIGNANCY AND VERY SEVERELY CENSURED BY THE COMMONS
TO COMPLAIN OF THE PARLIAMENT'S EMPLOYING THE POWER OF TAXATION AS THE MEANS OF EXTORTING CONCESSIONS FROM THEIR SOVEREIGN WERE TO EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD ENTIRELY DISARM THEMSELVES AND RENOUNCE THE SOLE EXPEDIENT PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION FOR INSURING TO THE KINGDOM A JUST AND LEGAL ADMINISTRATION
AND NEVER DID THE KINGDOM APPEAR MORE FORMIDABLE TO ALL FOREIGN NATIONS
LESLEY LED HIM ABOUT FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE SAME LOW HABIT UNDER WHICH HE HAD DISGUISED HIMSELF
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE REASONINGS A COMMITTEE WAS CHOSEN TO FRAME WHAT WAS CALLED THE SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE BY WHICH THE MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES WERE EXCLUDED FROM ALL CIVIL AND MILITARY EMPLOYMENTS EXCEPT A FEW OFFICES WHICH WERE SPECIFIED
IN WHICH THE PETITIONERS PROPOSED AS A REMEDY FOR THE PUBLIC MISERIES THAT THOSE NOBLE WORTHIES OF THE HOUSE OF PEERS WHO CONCUR WITH THE HAPPY VOTES OF THE COMMONS MAY SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE REST AND SIT AND VOTE AS ONE ENTIRE BODY THE COMMONS GAVE THANKS FOR THIS PETITION.[V RUSH

NEXT MORNING ESSEX PROCEEDED ON HIS MARCH
AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN KEPT EVERYTHING IN PEACE AND OBEDIENCE
THEY VENTURED TO REPRESENT THEIR SENSE OF THE MATTER TO THE COMMONS
NEITHER CLARENDON NOR ANY OTHER OF THE ROYALISTS EVER JUSTIFY HIM FROM INSINCERITY AS NOT SUPPOSING THAT HE HAD EVER BEEN ACCUSED OF IT
FROM THE RANK OF A MONARCH TO BE DEGRADED INTO A SLAVE OF HIS INSOLENT UNGRATEFUL SUBJECTS SEEMED OF ALL INDIGNITIES THE GREATEST
HE WAS A LEATHER-SELLER IN LONDON HIS NAME PRAISE-GOD BAREBONE
AND EVEN THE PEOPLE IN GENERAL WERE DESIROUS OF SUCH A SETTLEMENT AND IN ALL JURIES WERE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY INDUCED TO GIVE THEIR VERDICT IN FAVOR OF A PROTECTOR
AND FINDING HIMSELF IN THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES AND OBSERVING THAT BALFOUR THE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER WAS DEVOTED TO THE POPULAR PARTY HE ABSOLUTELY DESPAIRED OF EVER ESCAPING THE MULTIPLIED DANGERS WITH WHICH HE WAS EVERY WAY ENVIRONED
728
EVEN AT PRESENT AN HISTORIAN WHO PROMPTED BY HIS COURAGEOUS GENEROSITY SHOULD VENTURE THOUGH FROM THE MOST AUTHENTIC AND UNDISPUTED FACTS TO VINDICATE THE FAME OF THAT PRINCE WOULD BE SURE TO MEET WITH SUCH TREATMENT AS WOULD DISCOURAGE EVEN THE BOLDEST FROM SO DANGEROUS HOWEVER SPLENDID AN ENTERPRISE FOOTNOTE 21
AND THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF HIS GUILT DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SOME PEEVISH OR AT MOST IMPERIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH AMIDST SUCH DESPERATE EXTREMITIES AND DURING A BAD STATE OF HEALTH HAD UNHAPPILY FALLEN FROM HIM
THEY VOTED THAT THE TROOPS WHICH IN OBEDIENCE TO THEM HAD ENLISTED FOR IRELAND AND DESERTED THE REBELLIOUS ARMY SHOULD BE DISBANDED OR IN OTHER WORDS BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR FIDELITY
THAT POET ALWAYS SAID THAT THE PROTECTOR HIMSELF WAS NOT SO WHOLLY ILLITERATE AS WAS COMMONLY IMAGINED
457 458 ETC
WHEN WILLIAM WHO HAD MARRIED AN ENGLISH PRINCESS SUCCEEDED TO HIS FATHER'S COMMANDS AND AUTHORITY THE STATES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE LATE KING WERE ACCUSED OF TAKING STEPS MORE FAVORABLE TO THE ROYAL CAUSE AND OF BETRAYING A GREAT PREJUDICE AGAINST THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT
AS THE KING RESOLVED TO TRY WHETHER THIS HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD BE MORE COMPLIANT THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS AND GRANT HIM SUPPLY ON ANY REASONABLE TERMS THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WAS LATE AND VERY NEAR THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR OPENING THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE SCOTS
THE FORCES ASSEMBLED BY THE KING AT OXFORD IN THE WEST AND IN OTHER PLACES WERE EQUAL IF NOT SUPERIOR IN NUMBER TO THEIR ADVERSARIES
IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS
IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER IT IMPOSES SUCH EVIDENT VIOLENCE AS TO ENTITLE THE PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY OTHER AUTHORITY OR CONCESSION TO CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCLUDING IT
ON WEAKER MINDS THE EFFECT OF THESE COMPLICATED PASSIONS WAS PRODIGIOUS
CROMWELL HIMSELF HE ALWAYS ASSERTED COULD NOT LONG HAVE MAINTAINED HIS USURPATION
THE IMPORT OF THEM WAS TO PRESENT A MOST HUMBLE PETITION TO THE KING AND TO RESCUE HIM AND THE ROYAL FAMILY FROM THOSE DESPERATE MALIGNANTS WHO HAD SEIZED THEIR PERSONS TWO DAYS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE ROYALISTS FROM SHREWSBURY HE LEFT WORCESTER
HIS PERSON WAS UNGRACEFUL HIS DRESS SLOVENLY HIS VOICE UNTONABLE HIS ELOCUTION HOMELY TEDIOUS OBSCURE AND EMBARRASSED
THIS WEAKNESS HOWEVER WAS CAREFULLY CONCEALED FROM THE ARMY AND LORD CONWAY SAID THAT IF ANY LAWYER WERE SO IMPRUDENT AS TO DISCOVER THE SECRET TO THE SOLDIERS IT WOULD BE NECESSARY INSTANTLY TO REFUTE IT AND TO HANG THE LAWYER HIMSELF BY SENTENCE OF A COURT MARTIAL NALSON VOL
18 19 ETC
SO PREVALENT WAS THE OPINION OF WITCHCRAFT THAT GREAT NUMBERS ACCUSED OF THAT CRIME WERE BURNT BY SENTENCE OF THE MAGISTRATES THROUGHOUT ALL PARTS OF SCOTLAND
FOR WHO CAN FORETELL HOW FREQUENTLY GRIEVANCES MAY OCCUR OR WHAT PART OF ADMINISTRATION MAY BE AFFECTED BY THEM
BUT THOUGH THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL BORE GREAT FAVOR TO THE KING THE STATES WERE UNEASY AT HIS PRESENCE
WESTMINSTER HALL NAY THE WHOLE CITY RANG WITH SHOUTS AND ACCLAMATIONS
AND AS A REMEDY FOR ALL THESE EVILS HE IS DESIRED TO INTRUST EVERY OFFICE AND COMMAND TO PERSONS IN WHOM HIS PARLIAMENT SHOULD HAVE CAUSE TO CONFIDE RUSH
AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN SUMMONED FOR SEVERAL YEARS A NEW OATH WAS ARBITRARILY IMPOSED ON INTRANTS BY WHICH THEY SWORE TO OBSERVE THE ARTICLES OF PERTH AND SUBMIT TO THE LITURGY AND CANONS
SEE NOTE N AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN INTRUSTED HIS PURPOSE TO ANY ONE
AND PARTICULARLY TO OBSERVE INVIOLABLY THE LAWS TO WHICH I HAVE GIVEN MY CONSENT THIS PARLIAMENT
AND THE KING'S COMMISSIONERS WERE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERY AND THE DIRECTORY POSITIVELY DEMANDED TOGETHER WITH THE SUBSCRIPTION OF THE COVENANT BOTH BY THE KING AND KINGDOM WHITLOCKE P

THE OFFICE OF CONSERVATORS OF THE PEACE WAS NEWLY ERECTED IN SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE CONFEDERACY BETWEEN THE TWO KINGDOMS
PROMPTED BY THESE PLAUSIBLE MOTIVES CHARLES WAS DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY TO DISSOLVE THE PARLIAMENT
AND THAT THE AFORESAID COMMISSIONS FOR PROCEEDING BY MARTIAL LAW MAY BE REVOKED AND ANNULLED
AND FROM NO INSTITUTION BESIDES THE ADMIRABLE ONE OF JURIES COULD BE EXPECTED THIS MAGNANIMOUS EFFORT
AND HAVING EXPOSED THE CITY TO THE SCORN AND DERISION OF ALL WHO HATED IT HE RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO HIS QUARTERS IN WESTMINSTER
AND NOTHING FURTHER WAS REGARDED THAN THE AFFECTIONS AND ATTACHMENTS OF THE PARTIES MEN'S PASSIONS WERE TOO MUCH HEATED TO BE SHOCKED WITH ANY INSTANCE OF INJUSTICE WHICH SERVED ENDS SO POPULAR AS THOSE WHICH WERE PURSUED BY THIS HOUSE OF COMMONS
THEY CERTAINLY WOULD CUT OFF THE NEW IMPOSITIONS WHICH MARY AND ELIZABETH BUT ESPECIALLY JAMES HAD LEVIED AND WHICH FORMED NO DESPICABLE PART OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE
ALL OF THEM WERE INTENT IN SEARCH OF THE KING
THE LEISURE OF THOSE NOBLE ANCIENTS WAS TOTALLY EMPLOYED IN THE STUDY OF GRECIAN ELOQUENCE AND PHILOSOPHY

LAMBERT HIS CREATURE WHO UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF OBSEQUIOUSNESS TO HIM INDULGED IN UNBOUNDED AMBITION PROPOSED IN A COUNCIL OF OFFICERS TO ADOPT ANOTHER SCHEME OF GOVERNMENT AND TO TEMPER THE LIBERTY OF A COMMONWEALTH BY THE AUTHORITY OF A SINGLE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE KNOWN BY THE APPELLATION OF PROTECTOR
THE EARL OF TRAQUAIRE THE TREASURER SET OUT FOR LONDON IN ORDER TO LAY THE MATTER MORE FULLY BEFORE HIM

A GREAT MAN BUT A LEPER WE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A DETAIL OF THIS MATTER WHICH AT PRESENT SEEMS TO ADMIT OF LITTLE CONTROVERSY

THE PUNISHMENT OF LEADERS IS EVER THE LAST TRIUMPH OVER A BROKEN AND ROUTED PARTY
ALL OF THEM ZEALOUS ENEMIES TO OUR RELIGIOUS MODEL AND RESOLUTE TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR IDOLATROUS ESTABLISHMENTS
IMPOSE NOT MY LORDS DIFFICULTIES INSURMOUNTABLE UPON MINISTERS OF STATE NOR DISABLE THEM FROM SERVING WITH CHEERFULNESS THEIR KING AND COUNTRY

AND PLENTIFUL SUBJECT OF INQUIRY WAS SUGGESTED ON ALL HANDS
IN ORDER THEREFORE TO DIVERT THE COMMONS FROM THEIR INTENTION HE SENT A MESSAGE WHEREIN HE ACKNOWLEDGED PAST ERRORS AND PROMISED THAT HEREAFTER THERE SHOULD BE NO JUST CAUSE OF COMPLAINT
IN ONE DAY SEVERAL NEW PRIVY COUNSELLORS WERE SWORN
IN ALL COUNTIES THROUGH WHICH MONK PASSED THE PRIME GENTRY FLOCKED TO HIM WITH ADDRESSES EXPRESSING THEIR EARNEST DESIRE THAT HE WOULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN RESTORING THE NATION TO PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AND TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THOSE LIBERTIES WHICH BY LAW WERE THEIR BIRTHRIGHT BUT OF WHICH DURING SO MANY YEARS THEY HAD BEEN FATALLY BEREAVED
THE CONFUSION INTO WHICH ALL THINGS HAD BEEN THROWN HAD GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO MEN OF LOW STATIONS TO BREAK THROUGH THEIR OBSCURITY AND TO RAISE THEMSELVES BY THEIR COURAGE TO COMMANDS WHICH THEY WERE WELL QUALIFIED TO EXERCISE BUT TO WHICH THEIR BIRTH COULD NEVER HAVE ENTITLED THEM
440
IMPARTIAL REASONERS WILL CONFESS THAT THIS SUBJECT IS NOT ON BOTH SIDES WITHOUT ITS DIFFICULTIES
AND UNLESS THE KING SPEEDILY COMPLIED WITH THEIR DEMANDS THEY SHOULD BE CONSTRAINED FOR THE SAFETY OF PRINCE AND PEOPLE TO DISPOSE OF THE MILITIA BY THE AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND WERE RESOLVED TO DO IT ACCORDINGLY
THE HOLINESS OF CHURCHES THEY DERIDED
AND THAT THE DIVINE LAWS REQUIRED COMPLIANCE WITH EVERY DEMAND HOW IRREGULAR SOEVER WHICH THE PRINCE SHOULD MAKE UPON HIS SUBJECTS FOR THESE DOCTRINES THE COMMONS IMPEACHED MANWARING
SOME IRISH CATHOLICS CAME OVER WITH THESE TROOPS AND JOINED THE ROYAL ARMY WHERE THEY CONTINUED THE SAME CRUELTIES AND DISORDERS TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED THE PARLIAMENT VOTED THAT NO QUARTER IN ANY ACTION SHOULD EVER BE GIVEN THEM
EXCEPT DESPATCHING A SMALL BODY TO SUPPORT THE SCOTTISH COLONIES IN ULSTER THEY WOULD THEREFORE GO NO FURTHER AT PRESENT THAN SENDING COMMISSIONERS TO LONDON IN ORDER TO TREAT WITH THAT POWER TO WHOM THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY WAS NOW IN REALITY TRANSFERRED RUSH
AND EVERY OTHER BLESSING OF GOVERNMENT EXCEPT LIBERTY OR RATHER THE PRESENT EXERCISE OF LIBERTY AND ITS PROPER SECURITY IT SEEMED PROBABLE THEREFORE THAT AFFAIRS MIGHT LONG HAVE CONTINUED ON THE SAME FOOTING IN ENGLAND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SCOTLAND

AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL WAR ALL ENGLISHMEN WHO SERVED ABROAD WERE INVITED OVER AND TREATED WITH EXTRAORDINARY RESPECT
AND WHOEVER COULD NOT ASCERTAIN SO DIFFICULT A POINT OF CALCULATION COULD NOT PRETEND TO ANY TITLE TO SAINTSHIP
THE GENUINE FRUIT OF SINCERE CONFIDENCE AND REGARD
WHEN THEY WERE MARCHING TO BATTLE THE WHOLE FIELD RESOUNDED AS WELL WITH PSALMS AND SPIRITUAL SONGS ADAPTED TO THE OCCASION AS WITH THE INSTRUMENTS OF MILITARY MUSIC AND EVERY MAN ENDEAVORED TO DROWN THE SENSE OF PRESENT DANGER IN THE PROSPECT OF THAT CROWN OF GLORY WHICH WAS SET BEFORE HIM
WHERE HAS THIS SPECIES OF GUILT LAIN SO LONG CONCEALED SAID STRAFFORD IN CONCLUSION
HIS EXTRACTION WAS HONORABLE HIS PATERNAL FORTUNE CONSIDERABLE YET ENVY ATTENDED HIS SUDDEN AND GREAT ELEVATION
585 594
AFTER COMPLAINING OF THE ODIOUS SERVICE IN WHICH HA HAD BEEN EMPLOYED HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE HOUSE REPROACHING THEM AS WELL WITH THE NEW CABALS WHICH THEY HAD FORMED WITH VANE AND LAMBERT AS WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO A FANATICAL PETITION PRESENTED BY PRAISE-GOD BAREBONE
WHAT SECURITY EITHER AGAINST THE FURTHER EXTENSION OF THIS CLAIM OR AGAINST DIVERTING TO OTHER PURPOSES THE PUBLIC MONEY SO LEVIED
THE MORE TO EXCITE THE PEOPLE WHOSE DISPOSITIONS WERE ALREADY VERY SEDITIOUS THE EXPEDIENT OF PETITIONING WAS RENEWED
ACCUSTOMED TO INDULGE EVERY CHIMERA IN POLITICS EVERY FRENZY IN RELIGION THE SOLDIERS KNEW LITTLE OF THE SUBORDINATION OF CITIZENS AND HAD ONLY LEARNED FROM APPARENT NECESSITY SOME MAXIMS OF MILITARY OBEDIENCE
THE CHIEF USE OF HISTORY IS THAT IT AFFORDS MATERIALS FOR DISQUISITIONS OF THIS NATURE
AFTER A SHORT COMBAT THE CAVALRY OF THE ROYALISTS GAVE WAY
BURTON IN HIS BOOK WHERE HE COMPLAINED OF INNOVATIONS MENTIONED AMONG OTHERS THAT A CERTAIN WEDNESDAY HAD BEEN APPOINTED FOR A FAST AND THAT THE FAST WAS ORDERED TO BE CELEBRATED WITHOUT ANY SERMONS THE INTENTION AS HE PRETENDED OF THAT NOVELTY WAS BY THE EXAMPLE OF A FAST WITHOUT SERMONS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE WEDNESDAY'S LECTURES IN LONDON
THE JUSTICES AND COUNCIL OF IRELAND HAD BEEN ENGAGED CHIEFLY BY THE INTEREST AND AUTHORITY OF ORMOND TO FALL INTO AN ENTIRE DEPENDENCE ON THE KING
THEIR INTERESTS THEY WERE SENSIBLE WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THOSE OF THEIR GENERAL AND PROTECTOR
512 TELLS THE FOLLOWING STORY
THE LEAVING OF A MOST MALIGNANT AND PROFANE GUARD OF HORSE WHO BEING SENT FOR TO BE PURGED CAME TWO DAYS BEFORE THE DEFEAT AND WERE ALLOWED TO FIGHT WITH THE ARMY
THE FACILITY WHICH HE DISCOVERED IN YIELDING WHATEVER WAS REQUIRED OF HIM MADE THEM SUSPECT THAT HE REGARDED ALL HIS CONCESSIONS MERELY AS RIDICULOUS FARCES TO WHICH HE MUST OF NECESSITY SUBMIT
AND THOSE WHO ARE CURIOUS OF TRACING THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN MIND MAY REMARK HOW FAR ITS SEVERAL SINGULARITIES COINCIDE IN DIFFERENT AGES
AND THAT THE RIGHT OF PEACE AND WAR SHOULD NOT BE EXERCISED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THAT ASSEMBLY RUSH
CROMWELL FOUND HIMSELF IN A VERY BAD SITUATION
CONVENTIONS FOR NEUTRALITY THOUGH IN SEVERAL COUNTIES THEY HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO AND CONFIRMED BY THE MOST SOLEMN OATHS YET BEING VOTED ILLEGAL BY THE TWO HOUSES WERE IMMEDIATELY BROKEN AND THE FIRE OF DISCORD WAS SPREAD INTO EVERY QUARTER
234
OFFERED TO CONCUR IN ANY LAW THAT SHOULD ACQUIT OR SECURE THEM
SUCH WERE THE HAPPY IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE OF THOSE TIMES WITH REGARD TO TAXES CLARENDON VOL
THOUGH THEY HAD SEIZED HIS WHOLE REVENUE RENDERED IT TOTALLY PRECARIOUS AND MADE EVEN THEIR TEMPORARY SUPPLIES BE PAID TO THEIR OWN COMMISSIONERS WHO WERE INDEPENDENT OF HIM THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY HAD LIBERALLY SUPPORTED HIM IN HIS NECESSITIES
SIR HENRY VANE TOLD THE COMMONS THAT IF EVER GOD APPEARED TO THEM IT WAS IN THE ORDINANCES OF YESTERDAY
THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE AND MAINTAIN THE SUPERIORITY OF HIS COURT ABOVE THE PRISONER STILL INCULCATED THAT HE MUST NOT DECLINE THE AUTHORITY OF HIS JUDGES
FROM THE NOBILITY HE DESIRED ASSISTANCE
AND THE ISLAND OF POLERONE IN THE EAST INDIES WAS PROMISED TO BE CEDED TO THE LATTER
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THIS DELUSION OF THE INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WAS OF ALL OTHERS THE MOST CONTRARY TO COMMON SENSE AND THE ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF POLICY
27TH MARCH 1626
AT THE END OF THE VOLUME BY THE DIFFICULTIES AND DISTRESSES OF THE CROWN THE COMMONS WHO POSSESSED ALONE THE POWER OF SUPPLY HAD AGGRANDIZED THEMSELVES
THE VENERATION FOR PARLIAMENTS WAS AT THIS TIME EXTREME THROUGHOUT THE NATION THE CUSTOM OF REVILING THOSE ASSEMBLIES FOR CORRUPTION AS IT HAD NO PRETENCE SO WAS IT UNKNOWN DURING ALL FORMER AGES
TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES
THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT WAS TAKEN IN PIECES AND EXAMINED ARTICLE BY ARTICLE WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS ACCURACY
LLOYDE P
THE SOLDIERS RUSHED IN UPON THEM
THE STUDIES AND EVEN THE POCKETS OF THE EARL OF WARWICK AND LORD BROKE BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF PRIVILEGE WERE SEARCHED IN EXPECTATION OF FINDING TREASONABLE PAPERS
THE ENGLISH POSSESSED ALMOST THE SOLE TRADE WITH SPAIN
HIS ADMINISTRATION SO EXPENSIVE BOTH BY MILITARY ENTERPRISES AND SECRET INTELLIGENCE HAD EXHAUSTED HIS REVENUE AND INVOLVED HIM IN A CONSIDERABLE DEBT
BUT ESSEX FINDING THAT HIS ARMY FELL CONTINUALLY TO DECAY AFTER THE SIEGE OF READING WAS RESOLVED TO REMAIN UPON THE DEFENSIVE
NOT TO ME WHO HAVE SO EARNESTLY LABORED TO PRESERVE THE PEACE OF THE KINGDOM
HIS BIRTH AND CHARACTER WERE DEEMED TOO OBSCURE FOR A MAN RAISED TO ONE OF THE HIGHEST OFFICES OF THE CROWN

MONTROSE INFERIOR IN NUMBER TOTALLY UNPROVIDED WITH HORSE ILL SUPPLIED WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION HAD NOTHING TO DEPEND ON BUT THE COURAGE WHICH HE HIMSELF BY HIS OWN EXAMPLE AND THE RAPIDITY OF HIS ENTERPRISES SHOULD INSPIRE INTO HIS RAW SOLDIERS
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER HIM AS A SUBJECT AND ONE TOO OF NO HIGH CHARACTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HIS UNFORTUNATE SOVEREIGN HIS STYLE WILL BE ESTEEMED TO THE LAST DEGREE AUDACIOUS AND INSOLENT
MONK HOWEVER DISTRESSED HAD ALWAYS REFUSED THE MOST INVITING OFFERS FROM THE PARLIAMENT
THIS MAN SEEMED TO HAVE RENDERED HIMSELF AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY TO THE KING BY BETRAYING PROBABLY MAGNIFYING THE SECRET CABALS OF THE ARMY
113 127 128 129 134 136 141 144 149 158 159 ALL THESE PAPERS PUT IT PAST DOUBT THAT THE NECESSITIES OF THE ENGLISH ARMY IN IRELAND WERE EXTREME
CROMWELL WHO KNEW THE RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF FAIRFAX IN EVERY THING WHICH HE REGARDED AS MATTER OF PRINCIPLE VENTURED TO SOLICIT HIM WITH THE UTMOST EARNESTNESS
A NEW MODEL ALONE OF THE ARMY COULD BRING COMPLETE VICTORY TO THE PARLIAMENT AND FREE THE NATION FROM THOSE CALAMITIES UNDER WHICH IT LABORED
AND THAT UNPARALLELED BREACH OF PRIVILEGE--SO IT WAS CALLED--WAS STILL ASCRIBED TO THE COUNSEL OF PAPISTS AND THEIR ADHERENTS
AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES THE TWO ARMIES MET AT LANSDOWN NEAR BATH AND FOUGHT A PITCHED BATTLE WITH GREAT LOSS ON BOTH SIDES BUT WITHOUT ANY DECISIVE EVENT THE GALLANT GRANVILLE WAS THERE KILLED

AS IF THE MALIGNANTS--SO THEY CALLED THE KING'S PARTY--HAD HAD LAID A PLOT AT ONCE TO MURDER THEM AND ALL THE GODLY IN BOTH KINGDOMS
HAVING FELT MANY SENSIBLE INCONVENIENCIES FROM THE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT OF PARLIAMENTS HE ATTACHED HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THOSE WHO PROFESSED A DEVOTED OBEDIENCE TO HIS CROWN AND PERSON
THE CHARACTER OF THIS PRINCE AS THAT OF MOST MEN IF NOT OF ALL MEN WAS MIXED
AND SO GREAT WAS HIS POWER AND CREDIT HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY PROCURE THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PARLIAMENT OR ATTEMPT SOME OTHER DESPERATE MEASURE FOR HIS OWN PRESERVATION
HE HAD ENTERTAINED A PROJECT OF INSTITUTING A COLLEGE IN IMITATION OF THAT AT ROME FOR THE PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH
THE FORMER CHALLENGING TO THEIR OWN ORDER A CELESTIAL PEDIGREE DERIVED THE LEGISLATIVE POWER FROM A SOURCE NO MORE DIGNIFIED THAN THE VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATION OF THE PEOPLE
HE HIMSELF ENDEAVORING TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE WAS SEIZED BY INGOLDSBY TO WHOM HE MADE SUBMISSIONS NOT SUITABLE TO HIS FORMER CHARACTER OF SPIRIT AND VALOR
BY THEIR MEANS THE WAR WAS STILL KEPT ALIVE
BY SKIRMISHES AND SMALL RENCOUNTERS HE TRIED TO CONFIRM THE SPIRITS OF HIS SOLDIERS

SEE FURTHER CARTE'S ORMOND VOL
THEIR PROTECTORS WERE STIGMATIZED
AND IF THE COMMONS COMPLAIN OF THE AFFRONT OFFERED THEM BY AN ATTEMPT TO ARREST THEIR MEMBERS IN THEIR VERY PRESENCE THE BLAME MUST LIE ENTIRELY ON THEMSELVES
THE CITY MILITIA INFLUENCED BY TWO ALDERMEN TICHBURN AND IRETON EXPRESSED THE SAME RESOLUTION OF ADHERING TO THE GOOD OLD CAUSE
YOU DRANK CONFUSION TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S ENEMIES AND THE FELLOW WAS GONE BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCED THE LAST WORD THIS HINT SUPPLIED THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WITH A NEW METHOD OF DEFENCE
SCOT AND ROBINSON WERE SENT AS DEPUTIES BY THE PARLIAMENT UNDER PRETENCE OF CONGRATULATING THE GENERAL BUT IN REALITY TO SERVE AS SPIES UPON HIM
AMONG THE FANATICS OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER MUCH NOTED FOR HIS LONG PRAYERS SERMONS AND HARANGUES
A MEASURE HOWEVER OF WHICH HE SOON AFTER REPENTED AND WHICH THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS MORE THAN ANY CONVINCING REASON INCLINED EVERY ONE TO CONDEMN
AND IN THAT SHAPE IT WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE BISHOPS AT EDINBURGH BUT THE SCOTS HAD UNIVERSALLY ENTERTAINED A NOTION THAT THOUGH RICHES AND WORLDLY GLORY HAD BEEN SHARED OUT TO THEM WITH A SPARING HAND THEY COULD BOAST OF SPIRITUAL TREASURES MORE ABUNDANT AND MORE GENUINE THAN WERE ENJOYED BY ANY NATION UNDER HEAVEN
AND SCARCELY AN APPEARANCE OF LAW AND LIBERTY REMAINED IN THE ADMINISTRATION
INCHIQUIN WHO HAD NOW MADE A TREATY WITH THE KING'S LIEUTENANT HAVING WITH A SEPARATE BODY TAKEN TREDAH AND DUNDALK GAVE A DEFEAT TO OFFARRELL WHO SERVED UNDER O'NEAL AND TO YOUNG COOT WHO COMMANDED SOME PARLIAMENTARY FORCES
IT IS NOT EASY TO CONCEIVE THE GENERAL COMPASSION EXCITED TOWARDS THE KING BY THE PUBLISHING AT SO CRITICAL A JUNCTURE A WORK SO FULL OF PIETY MEEKNESS AND HUMANITY
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PREPARATIONS WHICH WERE MAKING AND THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH HE RECEIVED HE COULD NOT EVEN YET BELIEVE THAT HIS ENEMIES REALLY MEANT TO CONCLUDE THEIR VIOLENCES BY A PUBLIC TRIAL AND EXECUTION
HE PREACHED HE PRAYED HE FOUGHT HE PUNISHED HE REWARDED
THE ENGLISH COMMISSIONERS WHO SOME DAYS AFTER CAME TO TAKE HIM UNDER THEIR CUSTODY WERE ADMITTED TO KISS HIS HANDS
414 WHITLOCKE P
SUCH A MILITARY TURN AT THAT TIME PREVAILED AMONG THE ENGLISH
BY AN ORDER THEREFORE OF COUNCIL THEY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO REMOTE PRISONS

THAT VEIN OF FROLIC AND PLEASANTRY WHICH MADE A PART HOWEVER INCONSISTENT OF CROMWELL'S CHARACTER WAS APT SOMETIMES TO BETRAY HIM INTO OTHER INCONSISTENCIES AND TO DISCOVER ITSELF EVEN WHERE RELIGION MIGHT SEEM TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNED
AND INDEED ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT HISTORIAN'S NARRATIVE WHICH WE HAVE HERE FOLLOWED STRONGLY FAVOR THIS OPINION
COLONEL PRIDE PROCURED A PETITION AGAINST THE OFFICE OF KING SIGNED BY A MAJORITY OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE IN LONDON AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THOUGH IT IS MORE AGREEABLE TO THE NARROWNESS OF HUMAN VIEWS AND THE DARKNESS OF FUTURITY TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS DARING USURPER WAS GUIDED BY EVENTS AND DID NOT AS YET FORESEE WITH ANY ASSURANCE THAT UNPARALLELED GREATNESS WHICH HE AFTERWARDS ATTAINED
TO ADVANCE SO FAR WITHOUT BRINGING THE REBELS TO A TOTAL SUBMISSION AT LEAST TO REASONABLE CONCESSIONS WAS TO PROMISE THEM IN ALL FUTURE TIME AN IMPUNITY FOR REBELLION
ROAR OUT A TREBLE AS IT WERE A SORT OF BULLS
BUT AT LAST BY THE PREVALENCE OF ENVY WITH SOME
THE PRESBYTERIAN RELIGION WAS NEW REPUBLICAN AND SUITED TO THE GENIUS OF THE POPULACE
SUCH LOW ARTS OF POPULARITY WERE AFFECTED AND BY SUCH ILLIBERAL CANT WERE THE UNHAPPY PEOPLE INCITED TO CIVIL DISCORD AND CONVULSIONS
AND HAVING PRONOUNCED WITH A BROKEN VOICE A TENDER BLESSING ON HIS DEPARTING FRIEND SUNK INTO THE ARMS OF HIS ATTENDANTS.[V STAFFORD STILL SUPERIOR TO HIS FATE MOVED ON WITH AN ELATED COUNTENANCE AND WITH AN AIR EVEN OF GREATER DIGNITY THAN WHAT USUALLY ATTENDED HIM
HE DIED IN 1657 AGED SEVENTY-NINE
TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS FINE TO THE KING
IN THIS DESPERATE EXTREMITY HE EMBRACED A MEASURE WHICH IN ANY OTHER SITUATION MIGHT LIE UNDER THE IMPUTATION OF IMPRUDENCE AND INDISCRETION
THE EARL OF ESSEX SAT DOWN BEFORE THIS PLACE WITH AN ARMY OF EIGHTEEN THOUSAND MEN AND CARRIED ON THE SIEGE BY REGULAR APPROACHES
A DESIGN OF WHICH PIERCY'S EVIDENCE ACQUITS THE KING AND WHICH THE NEAR NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SCOTTISH ARMY SEEMS TO RENDER ABSOLUTELY IMPRACTICABLE BY MEANS HOWEVER OF THESE SUSPICIONS WAS THE SAME IMPLACABLE SPIRIT STILL KEPT ALIVE
IT WAS A USUAL PRACTICE WITH HIM IN ORDER TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF THE MORE WITH THE AGITATORS WHO WERE COMMONLY CORPORALS OR SERGEANTS TO TAKE THEM TO BED WITH HIM AND THERE AFTER PRAYERS AND EXHORTATIONS TO DISCUSS TOGETHER THEIR PROJECTS AND PRINCIPLES POLITICAL AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS
THE WIND SECONDED HIS COURAGE AND BLOWING FULL INTO THE BAY IN A MOMENT BROUGHT HIM AMONG THE THICKEST OF HIS ENEMIES
AND ALL AGREED THAT THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY THE FRENCH GENTLEMEN WHOSE ANGRY TONE OF VOICE HAD BEEN HEARD WHILE THEIR WORDS HAD NOT BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY THE BYSTANDERS
YET IN ORDER TO SATISFY HIS OWN PARTY WHO WERE IMPATIENT FOR PEACE HE AGREED TO SEND THE DUKE OF RICHMOND AND EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON WITH AN ANSWER TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO DESIRE A TREATY UPON THEIR MUTUAL DEMANDS AND PRETENSIONS IT NOW BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO RETRACT HIS FORMER DECLARATION THAT THE TWO HOUSES AT WESTMINSTER WERE NOT A FREE PARLIAMENT
DURING THESE TRANSACTIONS GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS OF MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD PASSED BETWEEN THE FRENCH KING AND THE PROTECTOR
17 CAR
BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES
THROUGH ALL THE HORRORS OF CIVIL WAR HE SOUGHT THE ABOLITION OF MONARCHY AND SUBVERSION OF THE CONSTITUTION
AT LENGTH THE FEVER INCREASED AND HE HIMSELF BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN SOME THOUGHTS OF DEATH AND TO CAST HIS EYE TOWARDS THAT FUTURE EXISTENCE WHOSE IDEA HAD ONCE BEEN INTIMATELY PRESENT TO HIM

WHEN THE QUESTION WAS READY TO BE PUT HE SAID AGAIN TO HARRISON THIS IS THE TIME
AND AS IT IS NATURAL FOR MEN TO PERSUADE THEMSELVES THAT THEIR INTEREST COINCIDES WITH THEIR INCLINATION HE HAD ESTABLISHED IT AS A FIXED MAXIM OF POLICY TO INCREASE THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THAT ORDER
BUT THE PEOPLE REFUSING TO GIVE HIM LEAVE SO TO DO OR TO STAY IN THE CHURCH HE WENT INTO THE CHURCHYARD AND THERE TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD A VISION WHEREIN HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMAND FROM GOD TO DELIVER HIS WILL UNTO THEM WHICH HE WAS TO DELIVER AND THEY TO RECEIVE UPON PAIN OF DAMNATION
THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REVOLT WAS FIXED ON THE APPROACH OF WINTER THAT THERE MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULTY IN TRANSPORTING FORCES FROM ENGLAND

FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED
GET THEE GONE FOR A MAD FELLOW AS THOU ART IN ORDER TO PAVE THE WAY TO THIS ADVANCEMENT FOR WHICH HE SO ARDENTLY LONGED CROMWELL RESOLVED TO SACRIFICE HIS MAJOR-GENERALS WHOM HE KNEW TO BE EXTREMELY ODIOUS TO THE NATION THAT MEASURE WAS ALSO BECOME NECESSARY FOR HIS OWN SECURITY
BY THE ABOLITION OF THE STAR CHAMBER AND COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION THE PREROGATIVE THEY SAID HAS LOST ALL THAT COERCIVE POWER BY WHICH IT HAD FORMERLY SUPPRESSED OR ENDANGERED LIBERTY
THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND HAD EVER INVITED THE SCOTS FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL DISSENSIONS TO INTERPOSE THEIR MEDIATION WHICH THEY KNEW WOULD BE SO LITTLE FAVORABLE TO THE KING
HE FELL UPON THE POLE WAS DRAGGED UPON THE GROUND FOR SOME TIME
ONE OF THE QUARTERS OF MONTROSE HIS FAITHFUL SERVANT WHO HAD BORNE HIS COMMISSION HAD BEEN SENT TO ABERDEEN AND WAS STILL ALLOWED TO HANG OVER THE GATES WHEN HE PASSED BY THAT PLACE SIR EDWARD WALKER'S HISTORICAL DISCOURSES P
THE STREET BEFORE WHITEHALL WAS THE PLACE DESTINED FOR THE EXECUTION
HE WAS SENT TO BRIDEWELL CONFINED TO HARD LABOR FED ON BREAD AND WATER AND DEBARRED FROM ALL HIS DISCIPLES MALE AND FEMALE
AN ACT OF JUSTICE WHICH HE EXERCISED AT HOME GAVE LIKEWISE SATISFACTION TO THE PEOPLE
THE KING THAT HE MIGHT COMBAT THE PARLIAMENT WITH THEIR OWN WEAPONS APPOINTED LIKEWISE A MONTHLY FAST WHEN THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED IN THE DUTIES OF LOYALTY AND OF SUBMISSION TO THE HIGHER POWERS
THIS EVENT WAS IN ITSELF A MIGHTY BLOW TO THE KING
SHE WAS OF A GOOD FAMILY OF THE NAME OF STUART
AND TO BREAK ANY BULK WHATEVER
THIS MAN WAS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON CROMWELL
THE ATHENIANS HAVING INTERCEPTED A LETTER WRITTEN BY THEIR ENEMY PHILIP OF MACEDON TO HIS WIFE OLYMPIA SO FAR FROM BEING MOVED BY A CURIOSITY OF PRYING INTO THE SECRETS OF THAT RELATION IMMEDIATELY SENT THE LETTER TO THE QUEEN UNOPENED
AND SUCH AS WAS CALCULATED TO PROMOTE AN ENTIRE HARMONY BETWEEN PRINCE AND PARLIAMENT RUSH
NOR HAD HE ANY OTHER OBJECT IN HIS WARLIKE OPERATIONS THAN TO PRESERVE THAT AUTHORITY ENTIRE WHICH HIS PREDECESSORS HAD TRANSMITTED TO HIM

THIS MENACE MORE THAN ALL HIS GUARDS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SECURITY OF HIS PERSON 26 SEE NOTE Z AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND IN THAT PASSAGE TURNING HIMSELF TO SPEAK TO SIR THOMAS FRIAR A COLONEL IN THE ARMY HE WAS ON THE SUDDEN OVER SIR THOMAS'S SHOULDER STRUCK UPON THE BREAST WITH A KNIFE
HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM
HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS
A DREAM OR PROPHECY LORD CLARENDON MENTIONS WHICH HE AFFIRMS AND HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE TRUTH WAS UNIVERSALLY TALKED OF ALMOST FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WARS AND LONG BEFORE CROMWELL WAS SO CONSIDERABLE A PERSON AS TO BESTOW UPON IT ANY DEGREE OF PROBABILITY
IT IS NOW FULL TIME TO FREE HIM FROM ALL THESE NECESSITIES AND TO APPLY CORDIALS AND LENITIVES AFTER THOSE SEVERITIES WHICH HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR FULL COURSE AGAINST HIM
THE PROTECTOR'S ADMINISTRATION OF IRELAND WAS MORE SEVERE AND VIOLENT

BY LOANS AND VOLUNTARY PRESENTS SENT HIM FROM ALL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM HE SUPPORTED HIS INFANTRY
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONSISTED OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY
BLAKE TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIGHT JOINED HIS COUNTRYMEN WITH EIGHTEEN SAIL
IN APPEARANCE AS WELL AS IN REALITY THE KING WAS NOW DETHRONED
TO CARRY HIM A PRISONER INTO SCOTLAND WHERE FEW FORCES COULD BE SUPPORTED TO GUARD HIM WAS A MEASURE SO FULL OF INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER THAT EVEN IF THE ENGLISH HAD CONSENTED TO IT IT MUST HAVE APPEARED TO THE SCOTS THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER UNELIGIBLE
SINCE HE MAINTAINED THE SAME RESERVE AT A TIME WHEN CONSISTENT WITH COMMON SENSE HE COULD HAVE ENTERTAINED NO OTHER PURPOSE 27 SEE NOTE AA AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND IT WAS ORDAINED THAT THE LAST ACT OF EVERY PARLIAMENT SHOULD BE TO APPOINT THE TIME AND PLACE FOR HOLDING THE PARLIAMENT NEXT ENSUING BURNET MEM
IN OPPOSITION TO THE PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER A MILITARY PARLIAMENT WAS FORMED
THAT AS HE WAS CREDIBLY INFORMED BY MANY WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT IN DIFFERENT CONGREGATIONS THE SAME LAMENTATIONS AND DISCOURSES WHICH THE GODLY PREACHERS HAD MADE BEFORE THEM HAD BEEN HEARD IN OTHER CHURCHES
AND ASSERT THAT THOUGH SERVANTS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO REPRESENT THESE IMPORTANT POINTS TO THEIR MASTERS WHO ARE THEMSELVES NO BETTER THAN SERVANTS AND TRUSTEES OF THE PEOPLE
WITHOUT OTHER CONSOLATION THAN THAT OF RECEIVING AMONG THEIR COUNTRYMEN THE HONORS OF A GRAVE WHICH TO THEIR SLAUGHTERED COMPANIONS HAD BEEN DENIED BY THE INHUMAN BARBARIANS TEMPLE P
NO ONE COULD HAVE SUSPECTED FROM EXTERIOR APPEARANCES THAT SUCH DREADFUL SCENES WERE APPROACHING
THE KING LED ON HIS MAIN BODY AND DISPLAYED IN THIS ACTION ALL THE CONDUCT OF A PRUDENT GENERAL AND ALL THE VALOR OF A STOUT SOLDIER WHITLOCKE P
HAZELRIG WHO POSSESSED GREATER AUTHORITY IN THE PARLIAMENT WAS HAUGHTY IMPERIOUS PRECIPITATE VAINGLORIOUS
THEY APPOINTED FLEETWOOD LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BUT INSERTED IN HIS COMMISSION THAT IT SHOULD ONLY CONTINUE DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE HOUSE
HUMAN LEARNING DESPISED
OR WHAT WAS MORE TO BE DREADED MANY OF THEM ENGAGED IN THE SAME PARTY WITH THE REBELS RUSH
PRINCE RUPERT SENT INTELLIGENCE OF THE ENEMY'S APPROACH
AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE BUT THAT ANY OF THEM SHOULD VENTURE TO DESERT IT
AFTER MANY PIOUS CONSOLATIONS AND ADVICES THE KING GAVE HER IN CHARGE TO TELL THE QUEEN THAT DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE HE HAD NEVER ONCE EVEN IN THOUGHT FAILED IN HIS FIDELITY TOWARDS HER
WHEN STRAFFORD WAS CALLED OVER TO ENGLAND HE FOUND EVERY THING FALLING INTO SUCH CONFUSION BY THE OPEN REBELLION OF THE SCOTS AND THE SECRET DISCONTENTS OF THE ENGLISH THAT IF HE HAD COUNSELLED OR EXECUTED ANY VIOLENT MEASURE HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS CONDUCT FROM THE GREAT LAW OF NECESSITY WHICH ADMITS NOT WHILE THE NECESSITY IS EXTREME OF ANY SCRUPLE CEREMONY OR DELAY BUT IN FACT NO ILLEGAL ADVICE OR ACTION WAS PROVED AGAINST HIM
RECOVER THE GROUND WHICH HE HAD LOST AND ONE STEP FARTHER HE COULD NOT PREVAIL WITH HIMSELF TO ADVANCE
TO WHICH WE MAY ADD THAT CHARLES HIMSELF WAS CERTAINLY DECEIVED BY BUCKINGHAM WHEN HE CORROBORATED HIS FAVORITE'S NARRATIVE BY HIS TESTIMONY
THIS IN GENERAL
WHERE HAS THIS FIRE BEEN SO LONG BURIED DURING SO MANY CENTURIES THAT NO SMOKE SHOULD APPEAR TILL IT BURST OUT AT ONCE TO CONSUME ME AND MY CHILDREN
BUT EXHORTED THEM AND THE WHOLE NATION TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF PEACE BY PAYING OBEDIENCE TO THEIR LAWFUL SOVEREIGN HIS SON AND SUCCESSOR
THE GREAT OBSTACLE TO THE PEACE WAS FOUND NOT TO BE ANY ANIMOSITY ON THE PART OF THE ENGLISH BUT ON THE CONTRARY A DESIRE TOO EARNEST OF UNION AND CONFEDERACY
THEY COMPLAINED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS PROTESTATION THE BILLS WERE STILL INSISTED ON CONTRARY TO THE SOLEMN LEAGUE AND TO THE TREATY BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS
SINCE WE ARE UPON THIS SUBJECT IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO MENTION THAT BESIDES SETTING APART SUNDAY FOR THE ORDINANCES AS THEY CALLED THEM THE GODLY HAD REGULAR MEETINGS ON THE THURSDAYS FOR RESOLVING CASES OF CONSCIENCE AND CONFERRING ABOUT THEIR PROGRESS IN GRACE
I AM WEARY OF TREADING THESE WAYS
THE OFFICERS ENDEAVORED THOUGH IN VAIN TO PERSUADE THE SOLDIERS BY MAKING A VIGOROUS SALLY TO BREAK THROUGH AT LEAST TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEAR AS POSSIBLE
SEEING THEM REINSTATED IN AUTHORITY ALL ORDERS OF MEN FELT THE HIGHEST INDIGNATION
HAD THE QUEEN REGENT BEEN EVER SO MUCH INCLINED TO ASSIST THE ENGLISH PRINCE THE DISORDERS OF HER OWN AFFAIRS WOULD FOR A LONG TIME HAVE RENDERED SUCH INTENTIONS IMPRACTICABLE

26 JOHN STREET 1860 AND PHILADELPHIA
THAT LICENSE WHICH HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY WANT OF PAY HAD RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AMONG THEM AND RENDERED THEM MORE FORMIDABLE TO THEIR FRIENDS THAN TO THEIR ENEMIES
AND THAT THEREFORE IT WAS NECESSARY AS THE PETITION SEEMED TO BEAR HARD ON ROYAL PREROGATIVE TO COME EARLY TO SOME FIXED RESOLUTION EITHER GRACEFULLY TO COMPLY WITH IT OR COURAGEOUSLY TO REJECT IT
THEY IMMEDIATELY ORDERED LESLEY AND HOLBORNE TO MARCH AGAINST HIM WITH AN ARMY OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN
SOUBIZE WHO WITH HIS BROTHER THE DUKE OF ROHAN WAS THE LEADER OF THE HUGONOT FACTION WAS AT THAT TIME IN LONDON AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS
AND NOTHING COULD EQUAL THE FAVOR PAID TO THE ONE SIDE EXCEPT THE HATRED WHICH ATTENDED THE OTHER
THE GENIUS TOO OF THE NATION SEEMED GRADUALLY TO IMPROVE AND TO COMPOSE ITSELF TO THE SPIRIT OF DUTIFUL OBEDIENCE AND OF STEADY ENTERPRISE
HUMBLY SHOW UNTO OUR SOVEREIGN LORD THE KING THE LORDS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED THAT WHEREAS IT IS DECLARED AND ENACTED BY A STATUTE MADE IN THE TIME OF THE REIGN OF KING EDWARD I COMMONLY CALLED STATUTUM DE TALLAGIO NON CONCEDENDO THAT NO TALLAGE OR AID SHALL BE LEVIED BY THE KING OR HIS HEIRS IN THIS REALM WITHOUT THE GOOD WILL AND ASSENT OF THE ARCHBISHOPS BISHOPS EARLS BARONS KNIGHTS BURGESSES AND OTHER THE FREEMEN OF THE COMMONALTY OF THIS REALM
HE HAD THE POWER OF NOMINATING HIS SUCCESSOR
AND THE TROOPS OF THE NEW MODEL WERE UNIVERSALLY INFECTED WITH THAT ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT
THE PARLIAMENT DESTITUTE OF ALL HOPES OF PREVAILING RETAINED HOWEVER COURAGE TO RESIST

AND BY TRIFLING AND AMUSEMENT JESTING AND MAKING VERSES HE FEARED NOT EXPOSING HIMSELF TO THEIR MOST FAMILIAR APPROACHES WITH OTHERS HE SOMETIMES PUSHED MATTERS TO THE LENGTH OF RUSTIC BUFFOONERY
BUT UNEQUAL AND IRREGULAR IN HIS OPERATIONS
ALL THE FORMS OF CEREMONY INVENTED BY PRIDE AND OSTENTATION FOX AND HIS DISCIPLES FROM A SUPERIOR PRIDE AND OSTENTATION CAREFULLY REJECTED
AN OPEN COMMUNICATION COULD BE PRESERVED BETWEEN WALES AND THESE NEW CONQUESTS
BUT WHATEVER HAPPEN DO YOU FAITHFULLY HONOR AND OBEY YOUR PRINCE AND ADHERE TO THE CROWN
THAT THE ABSENCE OF SO MANY MEMBERS OCCUPIED IN DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS HAD RENDERED THE HOUSE EXTREMELY THIN AND DIMINISHED THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR DETERMINATIONS

THIS MEASURE WHICH DISCOVERS RATHER A CRUEL MOCKERY OF CHARLES THAN ANY SERIOUS DESIGN OF SUPPORTING HIM APPEARS SO EXTRAORDINARY WHEN CONSIDERED IN ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IT NATURALLY SUMMONS UP OUR ATTENTION AND RAISES AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE CAUSES OF A CONDUCT UNPRECEDENTED IN AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
THE KING'S MINISTERS AND COUNSELLORS THEMSELVES WERE MOST OF THEM SEIZED BY THE GENERAL CONTAGION
SAID THE QUEEN OF FRANCE YES MADAM I WILL ASSURE YOU QUOTH I FROM THE WITNESS OF MINE OWN EARS
THE DISPERSED SITUATION OF THE SPANISH DOMINIONS RENDERED THE NAVAL POWER OF ENGLAND FORMIDABLE TO THEM AND KEPT THAT EMPIRE IN CONTINUAL DEPENDENCE
AND HE PRETENDED MUCH TO DREAD LEST ALL HIS AUTHORITY AND THAT OF THE COMMANDING OFFICERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RESTRAIN THESE ENTHUSIASTS FROM THEIR BLOODY PURPOSES INTELLIGENCE BEING DAILY BROUGHT TO THE KING OF MENACES THROWN OUT BY THE AGITATORS HE BEGAN TO THINK OF RETIRING FROM HAMPTON COURT AND OF PUTTING HIMSELF IN SOME PLACE OF SAFETY
GREAT NUMBERS OF THE COMMONS THEMSELVES WERE KEPT AWAY BY FEAR OR VIOLENCE
AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN
THEIR LIBERTIES THEY BELIEVED WERE RAVISHED FROM THEM
AND HE RETIRED INTO FLANDERS
THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS THE WISEST AND MOST PASSIONATE LOVERS OF LIBERTY HAD EVER INTRUSTED TO THEIR SENATORS THE COMMAND OF ARMIES AND HAD MAINTAINED AN UNCONQUERABLE JEALOUSY OF ALL MERCENARY FORCES
IN THE AFTERNOON THE PRIVY SEAL BECAUSE HE CARRIED THE BISHOP IN HIS COACH WAS SO PELTED WITH STONES AND HOOTED AT WITH EXECRATIONS AND PRESSED UPON BY THE EAGER POPULACE THAT IF HIS SERVANTS WITH DRAWN SWORDS HAD NOT KEPT THEM OFF THE BISHOP'S LIFE HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO THE UTMOST DANGER THOUGH IT WAS VIOLENTLY SUSPECTED THAT THE LOW POPULACE WHO ALONE APPEARED HAD BEEN INSTIGATED BY SOME OF HIGHER CONDITION YET NO PROOF OF IT COULD BE PRODUCED

WHO HAVING JOINED THE CORNISH ARMY SOON OVERRAN THE COUNTY OF DEVON
HAD NOT THE PUNCTILIOUS PRINCIPLES OF ESSEX ENGAGED HIM AMIDST ALL THE DISGUSTS WHICH HE RECEIVED TO PAY IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT THIS ALTERATION HAD NOT BEEN EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME FATAL ACCIDENT
HE WAS CONDEMNED TO BE PUT FROM THE BAR
HOLLIS THE PRESENT LEADER OF THE PRESBYTERIANS WAS A MAN OF UNCONQUERABLE INTREPIDITY

THE GREAT ORNAMENT OF HISTORY DURING THESE REIGNS ARE THE CIVIL NOT THE MILITARY TRANSACTIONS
AND BEING THERE REDUCED TO CLOSE CONFINEMENT AND SECLUDED FROM ALL COMMERCE WITH HIS FRIENDS DESPAIRED THAT HIS AUTHORITY OR EVEN HIS LIBERTY WOULD EVER BE RESTORED TO HIM
HE FANCIED THAT HE HIMSELF WAS TRANSFORMED INTO CHRIST AND WAS BECOME THE REAL SAVIOR OF THE WORLD
LANGHORNE POYER AND POWEL PRESBYTERIAN OFFICERS WHO COMMANDED BODIES OF TROOPS IN WALES WERE THE FIRST THAT DECLARED THEMSELVES

YET IT MAY BE ALLOWED THAT THAT SECT WAS MORE AVERSE TO SUCH IRREGULARITIES AS PROCEED FROM THE EXCESS OF GAYETY AND PLEASURE THAN TO THOSE ENORMITIES WHICH ARE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF SOCIETY THE FORMER WERE OPPOSITE TO THE VERY GENIUS AND SPIRIT OF THEIR RELIGION
THE ROYALISTS HE HEARD HAD RENEWED THEIR CONSPIRACIES FOR A GENERAL INSURRECTION
TO BE SPEEDILY POISONED OR ASSASSINATED WAS THE ONLY PROSPECT WHICH HE HAD EVERY MOMENT BEFORE HIS EYES
AND WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE THERE STOPPED CONSIDERING THEIR PRESENT DISPOSITION MAY BE MUCH DOUBTED
WIDE OF THE CARESSING INSINUATING MANNERS OF HIS SON OR THE PROFESSING TALKATIVE HUMOR OF HIS FATHER
WHILE THE COMMITTEE WAS EMPLOYED IN FRAMING THE PETITION OF RIGHT THE FAVORERS OF EACH PARTY BOTH IN PARLIAMENT AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE ENGAGED IN DISPUTES ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WAS TO FORM A MEMORABLE ERA IN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT
AND IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR HIS VINDICATION TO OBSERVE THAT HIS ERRORS WERE THE MOST EXCUSABLE OF ALL THOSE WHICH PREVAILED DURING THAT ZEALOUS PERIOD
AND LIFTING OP THE COVER PEEPED INTO THE CUP
BY THE ASSISTANCE OF LORD SEYMOUR LORD PAULET JOHN DIGBY SON OF THE EARL OF BRISTOL SIR FRANCIS HAWLEY AND OTHERS HE HAD DRAWN TOGETHER SOME APPEARANCE OF AN ARMY
THE LATTER MAINTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF OUTVOTING THE DISAFFECTED PARTY AND SECURING BY PEACEFUL MEANS THE ALLEGIANCE OF THE KINGDOM UNHAPPILY FOR THE ROYAL CAUSE HAMILTON'S REPRESENTATIONS MET WITH MORE CREDIT FROM THE KING AND QUEEN THAN THOSE OF MONTROSE
HE OPENLY TOLD THEM THAT ASSASSINATIONS WERE BASE AND ODIOUS AND HE NEVER WOULD COMMENCE HOSTILITIES BY SO SHAMEFUL AN EXPEDIENT

HE OBTAINED A VOTE FROM THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT TO ARM FORTY THOUSAND MEN IN SUPPORT OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY AND TO CALL OVER A CONSIDERABLE BODY UNDER MONRO WHO COMMANDED THE SCOTTISH FORCES IN ULSTER

NOR WOULD ALL THEIR NEW INVENTED LIMITATIONS BE ABLE TOTALLY TO SUPPRESS AN AUTHORITY TO WHICH THE NATION HAD EVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED

11TH OF AUGUST 1648 WHITLOCKE P
AND STARTING FROM HIS BED SAW EVERY THING ALREADY IN TUMULT AND CONFUSION
HIS ACTIVE DISPOSITION AND AVIDITY OF EXTENSIVE GLORY MADE HIM INCAPABLE OF REPOSE
AND IT WAS BELIEVED BY MANY THAT HE WAS ANIMATED WITH A SINCERE AND PASSIONATE LOVE OF LIBERTY AND NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY ANY MOTIVE TO SUBMIT TO THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF REGAL GOVERNMENT
AND THAT IN SUCH A CASE WHERE THE TITLES ARE EQUAL AND THE SUBJECT INDIVISIBLE THE PREFERENCE WAS DUE TO THE PRESENT POSSESSOR
DISTRACTIONS EVERY WHERE TERRORS OPPRESSIONS CONVULSIONS
XVI
HIS ZEAL AGAINST ALL THESE LEVITIES HE SAYS WAS FIRST MOVED BY OBSERVING THAT PLAYS SOLD BETTER THAN THE CHOICEST SERMONS AND THAT THEY WERE FREQUENTLY PRINTED ON FINER PAPER THAN THE BIBLE ITSELF
THE CRIMES OF THAT BLOODY TYRANT ARE SO ENORMOUS THAT THEY BREAK THROUGH ALL RULES
WHILE SO MANY OBJECTS OF DERISION SURROUNDED THEM IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BE ALTOGETHER INSENSIBLE TO THE TEMPTATION AND WHOLLY TO SUPPRESS THE LAUGH
AND AS THAT RANK OF MEN HAD NO SEPARATE AUTHORITY AND NO DEPENDENCE BUT ON THE CROWN THE ROYAL POWER IT WOULD SEEM MIGHT WITH THE GREATER SAFETY BE INTRUSTED IN THEIR HANDS

AFTER COMPLAINING OF THE ARREARS DUE TO THE ARMY THEY THERE DESIRED THE PARLIAMENT TO REFLECT HOW MANY YEARS THEY HAD SITTEN AND WHAT PROFESSIONS THEY HAD FORMERLY MADE OF THEIR INTENTIONS TO NEW MODEL THE REPRESENTATIVE AND ESTABLISH SUCCESSIVE PARLIAMENTS WHO MIGHT BEAR THE BURDEN OF NATIONAL AFFAIRS FROM WHICH THEY THEMSELVES WOULD GLADLY AFTER SO MUCH DANGER AND FATIGUE BE AT LAST RELIEVED
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF AS THE SUPREME MAGISTRATE TO WHOSE CARE HEAVEN BY HIS BIRTHRIGHT HAD COMMITTED HIS PEOPLE
EVERY ATTEMPT WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO GAIN THE POPULAR LEADERS AND BY OFFICES TO ATTACH THEM TO THE CROWN HAD FAILED OF SUCCESS EITHER FOR WANT OF SKILL IN CONDUCTING IT OR BY REASON OF THE SLENDER PREFERMENTS WHICH IT WAS THEN IN THE KING'S POWER TO CONFER
HE HAD BEEN SO LITTLE STUDIOUS OF IMPROVING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE IN THOSE CIVIL WARS OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN ONE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR THAT THE PARLIAMENT THOUGHT THEMSELVES OBLIGED FROM GRATITUDE TO PAY THE DEBTS WHICH HE HAD CONTRACTED WE NOW RETURN TO THE MILITARY OPERATIONS WHICH DURING THE WINTER WERE CARRIED ON WITH VIGOR IN SEVERAL PLACES NOTWITHSTANDING THE SEVERITY OF THE SEASON
AND IT SEEMED A PECULIAR HAPPINESS THAT THE IRISH REBELLION HAD SUCCEEDED AT SO CRITICAL A JUNCTURE TO THE PACIFICATION OF SCOTLAND
AND YOU HAVE AN ARMY IN IRELAND WHICH YOU MAY EMPLOY TO REDUCE THIS KINGDOM TO OBEDIENCE
MOST OF THE INDEPENDENTS LEFT THE PLACE
SIR GEORGE RATCLIFFE IN HIS LIFE OF STRAFFORD TELLS THE STORY THE SAME WAY THAT CLARENDON AND WHITLOCKE DO
FIERCE IN HIS NATURE THOUGH PROBABLY SINCERE IN HIS INTENTIONS HE PURPOSED BY ARBITRARY POWER TO ESTABLISH LIBERTY AND IN PROSECUTION OF HIS IMAGINED RELIGIOUS PURPOSES HE THOUGHT HIMSELF DISPENSED FROM ALL THE ORDINARY RULES OF MORALITY BY WHICH INFERIOR MORTALS MUST ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE GOVERNED
FOR THE KINGS OF ENGLAND HAD HITHERTO LIVED AMONG THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE FATHERS AMONG THEIR CHILDREN AND HAD DERIVED ALL THEIR SECURITY FROM THE DIGNITY OF THEIR CHARACTER AND FROM THE PROTECTION OF THE LAWS
A PRACTICE WHICH HAS EVER STRUCK THEIR SENSES AND OF WHICH THEY HAVE SEEN AND HEARD INNUMERABLE PRECEDENTS HAS AN AUTHORITY WITH THEM MUCH SUPERIOR TO THAT WHICH ATTENDS MAXIMS DERIVED FROM ANTIQUATED STATUTES AND MOULDY RECORDS
AN ARMY NEW LEVIED UNDISCIPLINED FRIGHTENED SEDITIOUS ILL PAID AND GOVERNED BY NO PROPER AUTHORITY WAS VERY UNFIT FOR WITHSTANDING A VICTORIOUS AND HIGH-SPIRITED ENEMY AND RETAINING IN SUBJECTION A DISCONTENTED AND ZEALOUS NATION
THE INDEPENDENTS FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE SAME ZEAL WERE LED INTO THE MILDER PRINCIPLES OF TOLERATION
THE ACCOUNT OF THE FORGERY COMES THROUGH SEVERAL HANDS AND FROM MEN OF CHARACTERS NOT FULLY KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC
FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL WERE POSTED AT WINDSOR WITH THE NEW-MODELLED ARMY ABOUT TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND MEN
177
177
177
THE COMMONS JUDGED IT REQUISITE TO ENACT A NEW LAW WHICH MIGHT NOT BE ELUDED OR VIOLATED BY ANY INTERPRETATION CONSTRUCTION OR CONTRARY PRECEDENT
165
165
IT SEEMED NECESSARY THEREFORE TO EMPLOY THE GREATEST CELERITY IN SUPPRESSING SO DANGEROUS A FOE
THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS SITTING WITH SOME COMPANY
CHASED THEM OFF THE FIELD
WE HAVE CARRIED ON THESE TRANSACTIONS A FEW YEARS BEYOND THE PRESENT PERIOD THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THEM NOR BE HENCEFORTH INTERRUPTED IN OUR ACCOUNT OF CHARLES'S COURT AND KINGDOMS
THEIR SLAIN WERE NOT MUCH INFERIOR IN NUMBER TO THOSE OF THE ENEMY
MATURED NOT CHILLED BY HIS ADVANCED AGE AND LONG EXPERIENCE
BUT WHEN THESE FORMS APPEARED TO HIM BY THE INVETERATE OBSTINACY OF THE COMMONS TO HAVE NO OTHER TENDENCY THAN TO DISTURB THAT HARMONY AND TO INTRODUCE A NEW CONSTITUTION HE CONCLUDED THAT IN THIS VIOLENT SITUATION WHAT WAS SUBORDINATE MUST NECESSARILY YIELD TO WHAT WAS PRINCIPAL AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE FOR A TIME GIVE PLACE TO ROYAL PREROGATIVE
THEY FOUND LIKEWISE UPON INQUIRY THAT ALL THE COPIES OF THE PETITION OF RIGHT WHICH WERE DISPERSED HAD BY THE KING'S ORDERS ANNEXED TO THEM THE FIRST ANSWER WHICH HAD GIVEN SO LITTLE SATISFACTION TO THE COMMONS AN EXPEDIENT BY WHICH CHARLES ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE THAT HE HAD NOWISE RECEDED FROM HIS FORMER CLAIMS AND PRETENSIONS PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE LEVYING OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF CROMWELL'S LIFE IN WHICH HIS ABILITIES ARE PRINCIPALLY DISCOVERED IS HIS RISING FROM A PRIVATE STATION IN OPPOSITION TO SO MANY RIVALS SO MUCH ADVANCED BEFORE HIM TO A HIGH COMMAND AND AUTHORITY IN THE ARMY
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DETERMINATION MANY OF THE NOBILITY AND PRIME GENTRY OF THE NATION WHILE ONLY EXERTING AS THEY JUSTLY THOUGHT THE LEGAL POWERS OF MAGISTRACY UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND THEMSELVES INVOLVED IN THE CRIME OF DELINQUENCY
THE MILITIA RESTORED TO THE INDEPENDENTS
BUT ARE SO UNLIKE THE BOMBAST PERPLEXED RHETORICAL AND CORRUPT STYLE OF DR GAUDEN TO WHOM THEY ARE ASCRIBED THAT NO HUMAN TESTIMONY SEEMS SUFFICIENT TO CONVINCE US THAT HE WAS THE AUTHOR
THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE FORESTS CONDEMNED
SUCH WAS THE KING'S SITUATION THAT IN ORDER TO RESTORE PEACE TO THE NATION HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DEMAND ANY OTHER TERMS THAN THE RESTORING OF THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION
AND HIS FRIEND HAMBDEN ALONE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE DEPTH OF HIS GENIUS AND FORETOLD THAT IF A CIVIL WAR SHOULD ENSUE HE WOULD SOON RISE TO EMINENCE AND DISTINCTION
FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR THE GOOD-NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR CHARLES HAD VERY LITTLE REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH HIS SITUATION
HIS CONCESSIONS THEREFORE ON THIS HEAD HE JUDGED SUFFICIENT WHEN HE AGREED THAT AN INDULGENCE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO TENDER CONSCIENCES WITH REGARD TO CEREMONIES
239
239
AND THEY REQUIRED THAT ALL OTHER ECCLESIASTICAL CONTROVERSIES SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY THEIR ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES
BUT DID NOT YOU SOLEMNLY APPEAL AND PRAY
AND THEY WERE APT TO DERIDE THE NEGLIGENCE WITH WHICH THESE IMPORTANT EDICTS HAD BEEN COMPILED WHEN THEY FOUND THAT THE NEW LITURGY OR SERVICE-BOOK WAS EVERY WHERE UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES ENJOINED BY THEM THOUGH IT HAD NOT YET BEEN COMPOSED OR PUBLISHED IT WAS HOWEVER SOON EXPECTED
NOTHING CAN GIVE US A HIGHER IDEA OF THE CAPACITY OF THOSE MEN WHO NOW GUIDED THE COMMONS AND OF THE GREAT AUTHORITY WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED THAN THE FORMING AND EXECUTING OF SO JUDICIOUS AND SO DIFFICULT A PLAN OF OPERATIONS
AND THESE CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF MEN IN WHOM THE PARLIAMENT COULD CONFIDE
11 12 13 247
THEY REPRESENTED THAT THEY WERE THE KING'S COUNSELLORS AND HAD CONCURRED BY THEIR ADVICE IN ALL THOSE MEASURES WHICH WERE NOW IMPUTED AS CRIMES TO THEIR ROYAL MASTER
THE SCOTS HAVING MADE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF CARLISLE AFTER AN OBSTINATE SIEGE MARCHED SOUTHWARDS AND LAID SIEGE TO HEREFORD
IN IRELAND DURING THESE TRANSACTIONS THE AUTHORITY OF THE NUNCIO PREVAILED WITHOUT CONTROL AMONG ALL THE CATHOLICS
AND NO ACT OF PARLIAMENT NOTHING BUT THE CONSENT OF THE CHURCH ITSELF WAS REPRESENTED AS SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY CHANGE IN RELIGIOUS WORSHIP OR DISCIPLINE
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WILL BE FOUND TO REFLECT GREAT PRAISE ON THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THAT PEOPLE NOW SO UNHAPPILY ROUSED TO ARMS
283 284
THE SPIRIT OF FANATICISM BY WHICH THAT ASSEMBLY HAD AT FIRST BEEN STRONGLY SUPPORTED WAS NOW TURNED IN A GREAT MEASURE AGAINST THEM
190 191 290
1173 1182 1184 1199 1200 1203 1204
THAT THEY OVERRULED HIS OBJECTIONS
1425
FROM ACCIDENT AND INTRIGUE HE WAS CHOSEN BY THE TOWN OF CAMBRIDGE MEMBER OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT
AND OVERTAKING THE ROYALISTS ON CHALGRAVE FIELD ENTERED INTO THE THICKEST OF THE BATTLE
HE WAS ACTIVE IN PROMOTING THE FAMOUS REMONSTRANCE WHICH WAS THE SIGNAL FOR ALL THE ENSUING COMMOTIONS
BUT NO SOONER HAD THEY SURRENDERED THAN THE REBELS WITH PERFIDY EQUAL TO THEIR CRUELTY MADE THEM SHARE THE FATE OF THEIR UNHAPPY COUNTRYMEN OTHERS MORE INGENIOUS STILL IN THEIR BARBARITY TEMPTED THEIR PRISONERS BY THE FOND LOVE OF LIFE TO IMBRUE THEIR HANDS IN THE BLOOD OF FRIENDS BROTHERS PARENTS
HIS FACE WAS REGULAR HANDSOME AND WELL COMPLEXIONED
BUT BY A VOTE OF THE HOUSE THEY COULD NOT BE UNDER TWO YEARS RENT OF THE DELINQUENT'S ESTATE
THE KING'S PROTESTATION TO ORMOND OUGHT BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THAT PRINCE'S CHARACTER AND THE REASONS HE ASSIGNS TO HAVE THE GREATEST WEIGHT
HE DREW HIS SHIPS CLOSE UP TO THE CASTLES AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITH HIS ARTILLERY
THE PRESBYTERIAN CLERGY ALSO SAVED FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE ANABAPTISTS AND MILLENARIANS AND ENJOYING THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS AND TITHES WERE NOT AVERSE TO HIS GOVERNMENT
AND WHERE THE MISERABLE OWNERS SHUT UP IN THEIR HOUSES AND PREPARING FOR DEFENCE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES TOGETHER WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN A DOUBLE TRIUMPH WAS AFFORDED TO THEIR INSULTING FOES IF ANY WHERE A NUMBER ASSEMBLED TOGETHER AND ASSUMING COURAGE FROM DESPAIR WERE RESOLVED TO SWEETEN DEATH BY REVENGE ON THEIR ASSASSINS THEY WERE DISARMED BY CAPITULATIONS AND PROMISES OF SAFETY CONFIRMED BY THE MOST SOLEMN OATHS
HIS WHOLE ARMY WAS DISPERSED
AND IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE INTENDED TO RESIGN THE CROWN TO HIS SON
BUT HE COULD NOT CONSENT ENTIRELY TO ABOLISH AN ORDER WHICH HE THOUGHT AS ESSENTIAL TO THE BEING OF A CHRISTIAN CHURCH AS HIS SCOTTISH SUBJECTS DEEMED IT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT SACRED INSTITUTION
INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE AND ESTABLISH ORTHODOXY BY THE SWORD AND BY PENAL STATUTES THEY SAW THE SECTARIAN ARMY WHO WERE ABSOLUTE MASTERS CLAIM AN UNBOUNDED LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE WHICH THE PRESBYTERIANS REGARDED WITH THE UTMOST ABHORRENCE
AND HAVING EXECUTED HIS PROJECT HE NOW HELD THE TOWN CLOSELY BLOCKADED ON ALL SIDES
29L
THEN PUTTING HIS HAND INTO HIS POCKET AND PULLING OUT A LITTLE BIBLE HE SHOWED IT OPEN TO THE PEOPLE SAYING HERE IS A BOOK YOU HAVE IN GREAT VENERATION CONSISTING OF TWO PARTS THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT
BUT FINDING THAT ALL THESE INJURIES PRODUCED ONLY REMONSTRANCES AND EMBASSIES OR AT MOST REPRISALS ON THE PART OF FRANCE HE RESOLVED TO SECOND THE INTRIGUES OF THE DUKE OF SOUBIZE AND TO UNDERTAKE AT ONCE A MILITARY EXPEDITION AGAINST THAT KINGDOM
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LOW CONDITION INTO WHICH THE HOUSE OF PEERS WAS FALLEN THERE APPEARED SOME INTENTION OF REJECTING THIS ORDINANCE
P 850
THE ARMY IN THEIR USURPATIONS ON THE PARLIAMENT COPIED EXACTLY THE MODEL WHICH THE PARLIAMENT ITSELF HAD SET THEM IN THEIR RECENT USURPATIONS ON THE CROWN
HE WEPT BITTERLY
THE OTHER HAD AN AIR OF GREATER SHOW AND ORNAMENT WAS ESTABLISHED ON ANCIENT AUTHORITY AND BORE AN AFFINITY TO THE KINGLY AND ARISTOCRATICAL PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION
I HAVE LEARNED TO BE BUSY MYSELF BY RETIRING INTO MYSELF
AND LORD GORDON ELDEST SON OF HUNTLEY HAVING ESCAPED FROM HIS UNCLE ARGYLE WHO HAD HITHERTO DETAINED HIM NOW JOINED MONTROSE WITH NO CONTEMPTIBLE NUMBER OF HIS FOLLOWERS ATTENDED BY HIS BROTHER THE EARL OF ABOINE
AND WHILE HE WAS MAKING THOSE PREPARATIONS THE NEIGHBORING STATES IGNORANT OF HIS INTENTIONS REMAINED IN SUSPENSE AND LOOKED WITH ANXIOUS EXPECTATION ON WHAT SIDE THE STORM SHOULD DISCHARGE ITSELF
P 146
HAD THAT BEEN HIS INTENTION WOULD HE HAVE RENDERED THE PARLIAMENT PERPETUAL
AND BEING DETERMINED THAT THE SWORD SHOULD CARRY CONVICTION TO ALL REFRACTORY MINDS THEY PREPARED THEMSELVES WITH GREAT VIGILANCE AND ACTIVITY FOR THEIR MILITARY ENTERPRISES
BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY BY AN ORDER OF THE COMMONS THE SHERIFFS AND JUSTICES HAVING APPOINTED CONSTABLES WITH STRONG WATCHES TO GUARD THE PARLIAMENT THE COMMONS SENT FOR THE CONSTABLES AND REQUIRED THEM TO DISCHARGE THE WATCHES CONVENED THE JUSTICES VOTED THEIR ORDERS A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE AND SENT ONE OF THEM TO THE TOWER NALSON VOL
HE REQUESTED A PERSONAL TREATY WITH THE PARLIAMENT
IT IS TRUE HAD THE KING BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT GOVERNMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSTAIN FROM ALL INVASION OF NATIONAL PRIVILEGES IT SEEMS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE PURITANS EVER COULD HAVE ACQUIRED SUCH AUTHORITY AS TO OVERTURN THE WHOLE CONSTITUTION
THOUGH THE NEW SECTARIES COMPOSED NOT AT FIRST THE MAJORITY OF THE NATION THEY WERE INFLAMED AS IS USUAL AMONG INNOVATORS WITH EXTREME ZEAL FOR THEIR OPINIONS
AND NATIONAL PREJUDICES EMPOISONED BY THOSE AVERSIONS MORE DEADLY AND INCURABLE WHICH AROSE FROM AN ENRAGED SUPERSTITION
ST ANTHOLINE'S CHURCH WAS ASSIGNED THEM FOR THEIR DEVOTIONS
IN ALL UNPOPULAR AND ILLEGAL MEASURES HE WAS EVER MOST ACTIVE
THE INTENTION WAS THAT SIR PHELIM O'NEALE AND THE OTHER CONSPIRATORS SHOULD BEGIN AN INSURRECTION ON ONE DAY THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCES AND SHOULD ATTACK ALL THE ENGLISH SETTLEMENTS
THE KING BEGAN TO APPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCES
HE PLACED NO GUARD AT THE DOOR OF EITHER HOUSE
AND HAVING EXERTED HIMSELF IN AN ACTION GAINED ON THE AFFECTIONS OF THE SOLDIERY WHO WERE MORE DESIROUS OF SERVING UNDER A YOUNG PRINCE OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAN UNDER A COMMITTEE OF TALKING GOWN-MEN
LANERIC
THE HIERARCHY EXALTED AT THE EXPENSE OF NATIONAL PRIVILEGES
DURING THE LIFE OF FREDERIC HENRY PRINCE OF ORANGE THE DUTCH REPUBLIC HAD MAINTAINED A NEUTRALITY IN THE CIVIL WARS OF ENGLAND AND HAD NEVER INTERPOSED EXCEPT BY HER GOOD OFFICES BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES
ABOVE ALL THE GENERAL WAS AVERSE TO THE MENTION OF CONDITIONS
THIS GENERAL POSITION BEING ESTABLISHED IT MUST HOWEVER BE OBSERVED THAT NO READER ALMOST OF ANY PARTY OR PRINCIPLE WAS EVER SHOCKED WHEN HE READ IN ANCIENT HISTORY THAT THE ROMAN SENATE VOTED NERO THEIR ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGN TO BE A PUBLIC ENEMY AND EVEN WITHOUT TRIAL CONDEMNED HIM TO THE SEVEREST AND MOST IGNOMINIOUS PUNISHMENT
AND THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO HAD JOINED THEM FOUND THE WHOLE AMOUNT TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN THE KING THOUGH HIS CAMP HAD BEEN GRADUALLY REENFORCED FROM ALL QUARTERS WAS SENSIBLE THAT HE HAD NO ARMY WHICH COULD COPE WITH SO FORMIDABLE A FORCE AND HE THOUGHT IT PRUDENT BY SLOW MARCHES TO RETIRE TO DERBY THENCE TO SHREWSBURY IN ORDER TO COUNTENANCE THE LEVIES WHICH HIS FRIENDS WERE MAKING IN THOSE PARTS
AND THE COMMONS THOUGH THEMSELVES THE GREATEST INNOVATORS EMPLOYED THE USUAL ARTIFICE OF COMPLAINING AGAINST INNOVATIONS AND PRETENDING TO RECOVER THE ANCIENT AND ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
TOGETHER WITH THE SUSPENSION OF POININGS'S STATUTE WITH REGARD TO SOME PARTICULAR BILLS WHICH SHOULD BE AGREED ON
58
58
AS APPEARS BY THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND HUMBLE PETITION AND ADVICE HIS FREQUENT ENTERPRISES OBLIGED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME TO AUGMENT THEM
AND JOINING THE OLD IRISH RIVALLED THEM IN EVERY ACT OF VIOLENCE TOWARDS THE ENGLISH PROTESTANTS
THE EARLS OF CASSILIS AND LOTHIAN LORD BURLEY THE LAIRD OF LIBERTON AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS ARRIVED AT BREDA
THE BOLD AND RESTLESS GENIUS OF THE PROTECTOR LED HIM TO EXTEND HIS ALLIANCES AND ENTERPRISES TO EVERY PART OF CHRISTENDOM
ANIMATED WITH THE SPIRIT OF LOYALTY DERIVED FROM THEIR ANCESTORS THEY ADHERED TO THE ANCIENT PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION AND VALUED THEMSELVES ON EXERTING THE MAXIMS AS WELL AS INHERITING THE POSSESSIONS OF THE OLD ENGLISH FAMILIES
BY THEIR ADVICE ALTERATIONS WERE MADE IN THE THIRTY-NINE ARTICLES OR IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH
HE INFORMED THEM LIKEWISE THAT THE QUEEN IN A LETTER WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN TO HIM HAD VERY EARNESTLY RECOMMENDED THAT MEASURE
IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ORDINANCE TOO FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH THEY INSERTED A CLAUSE FOR THE TAKING DOWN OF MAYPOLES WHICH THEY CALLED A HEATHENISH VANITY
TO HAVE NEGLECTED THEM ENTIRELY HAD IT BEEN CONSISTENT WITH ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY HAD BEEN THE WISEST MEASURE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN EMBRACED
IT WAS NOT TILL THIS AGE WHEN THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY WAS UNIVERSALLY DIFFUSED WHEN THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT WERE NEARLY REDUCED TO A SYSTEM WHEN THE TEMPERS OF MEN MORE CIVILIZED SEEMED LESS TO REQUIRE THOSE VIOLENT EXERTIONS OF PREROGATIVE THAT THESE FIVE GENTLEMEN ABOVE MENTIONED BY A NOBLE EFFORT VENTURED IN THIS NATIONAL CAUSE TO BRING THE QUESTION TO A FINAL DETERMINATION
AND AS HE RESTORED THEM AFTERWARDS TO LIBERTY HIS SEVERITY PASSED ONLY FOR THE RESULT OF GENERAL JEALOUSY AND SUSPICION THE SECRET SOURCE OF HIS INTELLIGENCE REMAINED STILL UNKNOWN AND UNSUSPECTED
THAT WITHIN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS THE SCOTS SHOULD DISMISS THEIR FORCES
GENERAL AS WELL AS SOLDIER ON BOTH SIDES SEEMED AVERSE TO RENEW THE BATTLE
BUT THEY HAD ALREADY IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION PRESENTED THEIR PETITION OF RELIGION AND HAD RECEIVED A SATISFACTORY ANSWER
AND THESE DISTINCTIONS CONTINUED LONG AFTER TO DIVIDE AND AGITATE THE KINGDOM
SOME OF HIS PARTY OFFERING TO PUT AN END TO THOSE INTRIGUES BY THE DEATH OF LAMBERT HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT PURCHASE POWER OR DOMINION BY SUCH SANGUINARY MEASURES
HE WAS LEARNED IF POLEMICAL KNOWLEDGE COULD ENTITLE HIM TO THAT PRAISE
ALL THE ACTS OF ASSEMBLY SINCE THE ACCESSION OF JAMES TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND WERE UPON PRETTY REASONABLE GROUNDS DECLARED NULL AND INVALID
AND AS SOON AS HE WITHDREW TO YORK THEY TOTALLY STOPPED ALL PAYMENTS
HIS ARMY WAS RETAINED ENTIRELY BY PAY AND LOOKED ON THE QUARREL WITH THE SAME INDIFFERENCE WHICH NATURALLY BELONGS TO MERCENARY TROOPS WITHOUT POSSESSING THE DISCIPLINE BY WHICH SUCH TROOPS ARE COMMONLY DISTINGUISHED
BUT THIS PROJECT IT HAD NOT BEEN IN THE POWER SCARCELY IN THE INTENTION OF THE POPULAR LEADERS TO EXECUTE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE PASSION WHICH SEIZED THE NATION FOR PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE AND FOR THE WILD ENTHUSIASM WHICH AT THAT TIME ACCOMPANIED IT
159
159
THEY PRETENDED THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO PERILS SO DREADFUL AND IMMINENT THAT THEY HAD NOT LEISURE FOR SUCH A WORK THE EXPEDIENT PROPOSED BY THE KING SEEMED A SUFFICIENT REMEDY DURING THIS EMERGENCE AND YET MAINTAINED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN ENTIRE AND UNBROKEN
HE MARRIED AFFECTED A GRAVE AND COMPOSED BEHAVIOR ENTERED INTO ALL THE ZEAL AND RIGOR OF THE PURITANICAL PARTY AND OFFERED TO RESTORE TO EVERY ONE WHATEVER SUMS HE HAD FORMERLY GAINED BY GAMING
CLARENDON VOL I
A CREATURE OF THE COURT TO BECOME ITS OBSTINATE ENEMY A BISHOP TO COUNTENANCE PURITANS
GOD HATH OWNED HIS SON AND HATH OWNED YOU AND HATH MADE YOU TO OWN HIM
AND WHERE REAL GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT WERE WANTING THEY GREEDILY LAID HOLD OF IMAGINARY ONES
THIS WAS TOUCHING CHARLES IN A VERY TENDER POINT
1627 SIR RANDOLF CREW CHIEF JUSTICE HAD BEEN DISPLACED AS UNFIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COURT
AND IF A PRINCE LIKE THE SEA RECEIVE AND REPAY ALL THE FRESH STREAMS WHICH THE RIVERS INTRUST WITH HIM THEY WILL NOT GRUDGE BUT PRIDE THEMSELVES TO MAKE HIM UP AN OCEAN
AND THOUGH THE ROYALISTS MADE A BRAVE RESISTANCE YET NOT BEING SUCCORED IN TIME BY THEIR CONFEDERATES THEY WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES
SOLITUDE ASTONISHED HIM BY WITHDRAWING THAT PROTECTION WHICH HE FOUND SO NECESSARY FOR HIS SECURITY
THE OFFICE OF KING HAD BEEN PAINTED TO THEM IN SUCH HORRIBLE COLORS THAT THERE WERE NO HOPES OF RECONCILING THEM SUDDENLY TO IT EVEN THOUGH BESTOWED UPON THEIR GENERAL TO WHOM THEY WERE SO MUCH DEVOTED
THAT NO DEED OF THE KING'S SHOULD HAVE VALIDITY UNLESS IT PASSED THE COUNCIL AND WAS ATTESTED UNDER THEIR HAND
AND AFTER A FURIOUS ASSAULT THE SOLDIERS ENTERED SWORD IN HAND AND COMMITTED ALL THOSE DISORDERS TO WHICH THEIR NATURAL VIOLENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN INFLAMED BY RESISTANCE IS SO MUCH ADDICTED RUSH
189
AND THE PRESBYTERIANS ENDEAVORED TO OBTAIN THE LIEUTENANCY FOR WALLER THE INDEPENDENTS FOR LAMBERT
A COMMISSION WAS OPENLY GRANTED TO COMPOUND WITH THE CATHOLICS AND AGREE FOR DISPENSING WITH THE PENAL LAWS ENACTED AGAINST THEM BY THIS EXPEDIENT THE KING BOTH FILLED HIS COFFERS AND GRATIFIED HIS INCLINATION OF GIVING INDULGENCE TO THESE RELIGIONISTS
HYPOCRITES EXERCISING INIQUITY UNDER THE VISOR OF RELIGION
AS ENGLAND HAD NO MILITARY FORCE WHILE ALL THE OTHER POWERS OF EUROPE WERE STRONGLY ARMED A FLEET SEEMED ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HER SECURITY
A DEED TO WHICH NOTHING THEY THOUGHT BUT THE RAGE OF FANATICISM AND FACTION COULD HAVE IMPELLED THE PARLIAMENT
644 PARL
BY ASSUMING THE TOTAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WAR THEY ACQUIRED THE COURTSHIP AND DEPENDENCE OF EVERY ONE WHO HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH IRELAND OR WHO WAS DESIROUS OF ENLISTING IN THESE MILITARY ENTERPRISES
AND WAS IN EFFECT REDUCED TO BEGGARY
AND THAT ISLAND HAS EVER SINCE REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE ENGLISH
THE UTMOST EFFORTS OF THE KING COULD NOT RAISE ABOVE TEN THOUSAND MEN AT OXFORD
FROM HIS SUGGESTION CROMWELL SECRETLY CALLED AT WINDSOR A COUNCIL OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS IN ORDER TO DELIBERATE CONCERNING THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION AND THE FUTURE DISPOSAL OF THE KING'S PERSON RUSH
AND THIS METHOD OF PROCEEDING NO LESS POLITIC THAN MAGNANIMOUS WAS PRESERVED BY THE PARLIAMENT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE WAR
THE COUNCIL WAS ALARMED
THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH WAS CALLED THE COURT OF PUBLIC BENCH
AT FIRST HE WAS SHOCKED WITH INSTANCES OF RUDENESS AND FAMILIARITY TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO LITTLE ACCUSTOMED
IN THE PREAMBLE THE KING'S POWER OF PRESSING A POWER EXERCISED DURING ALL FORMER TIMES WAS DECLARED ILLEGAL AND CONTRARY TO THE LIBERTY OF THE SUBJECT
AND THAT HE NOW JOYFULLY FOLLOWED BY A LIKE UNJUST SENTENCE HIS LATE SOVEREIGN
A SURE PROOF THAT HE HAD FORMED NO SYSTEM FOR ENSLAVING HIS PEOPLE IS THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF HIS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TO RAISE A NAVAL NOT A MILITARY FORCE
AND EVEN AFTER THE TWENTY YEARS SHOULD BE ELAPSED THEY RESERVED A RIGHT OF RESUMING THE SAME AUTHORITY WHENEVER THEY SHOULD DECLARE THE SAFETY OF THE KINGDOM TO REQUIRE IT
WALLER EXCLAIMED LOUDLY AGAINST THAT GENERAL FOR ALLOWING WILMOT TO PASS HIM AND PROCEED WITHOUT ANY INTERRUPTION TO THE SUCCOR OF THE DISTRESSED INFANTRY AT THE DEVIZES
HE TOLD THE HOUSE THAT THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENABLED TO PERFORM WERE NO MORE THAN HIS DUTY AND MERITED NOT SUCH PRAISES AS THOSE WITH WHICH THEY WERE PLEASED TO HONOR HIM
BY TERRIFYING OTHERS WITH THE FEAR OF VENGEANCE FROM THE OFFENDED PRINCE THEY HAD ENGAGED GREATER NUMBERS INTO THE OPPOSITION AGAINST PEACE THAN HAD ADOPTED THEIR OTHER PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT AND RELIGION
BUT THERE REMAINS A LETTER OF CHARLES'S TO THE EARL OF LANERIC SECRETARY OF SCOTLAND IN WHICH HE PLAINLY INTIMATES THAT THAT MEASURE WAS VOLUNTARILY EMBRACED

THE PARLIAMENT INFORMED OF THIS EVENT BY THEIR COMMISSIONERS WERE THROWN INTO THE UTMOST CONSTERNATION WHITLOCKE P
363 364 ETC
NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER
AND HAVING GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER THE CROWN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOADED WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF TAXES FORMERLY UNKNOWN
BY AN EDICT OF THE TABLES WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS SUPREME AN ELDER FROM EACH PARISH WAS ORDERED TO ATTEND THE PRESBYTERY AND TO GIVE HIS VOTE IN THE CHOICE BOTH OF THE COMMISSIONERS AND MINISTERS WHO SHOULD BE DEPUTED TO THE ASSEMBLY
THIS INVASION OF THE PARLIAMENT COMMONLY PASSED UNDER THE NAME OF COLONEL PRIDE'S PURGE SO MUCH DISPOSED WAS THE NATION TO MAKE MERRY WITH THE DETHRONING OF THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAD VIOLENTLY ARROGATED THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENT AND DEPRIVED THE KING OF HIS LEGAL PREROGATIVES
AND MAHONE ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS BEING LIKEWISE SEIZED FIRST DISCOVERED TO THE JUSTICES THE PROJECT OF A GENERAL INSURRECTION AND REDOUBLED THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH ALREADY WERE UNIVERSALLY DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT DUBLIN BUT THOUGH O'CONOLLY'S DISCOVERY SAVED THE CASTLE FROM A SURPRISE THE CONFESSION EXTORTED FROM MAHONE CAME TOO LATE TO PREVENT THE INTENDED INSURRECTION
THE PRIVATE MEN IN THIS ARMY WERE ALL CATHOLICS
AND FOUND HIMSELF NECESSITATED TO FIGHT BOTH AGAINST THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND IN IRELAND AND AGAINST THE KING HIMSELF IN SCOTLAND
THEY INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS MOST FAITHFUL ADHERENTS
18TH 20TH JUNE 1628
HE FELT THAT THE GRANDEUR WHICH HE HAD ATTAINED WITH SO MUCH GUILT AND COURAGE COULD NOT INSURE HIM THAT TRANQUILLITY WHICH IT BELONGS TO VIRTUE ALONE AND MODERATION FULLY TO ASCERTAIN
NOT CONTENT WITH THE AUTHORITY WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED BY ATTACKING THESE GREAT MINISTERS THEY WERE RESOLVED TO RENDER THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BODIES OF THE NATION OBNOXIOUS TO THEM
THE PRESBYTERIANS INDEED BEING COMMONLY DENOMINATED THE MODERATE PARTY WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE INOFFENSIVE
THE ALARM BEING GIVEN EVERY ONE MOUNTED ON HORSEBACK IN ORDER TO PURSUE THE PRINCE TO RECOVER THE PRISONERS AND TO REPAIR THE DISGRACE WHICH THE ARMY HAD SUSTAINED
THOUGH THE GENTLENESS AND LENITY OF THE KING'S TEMPER MIGHT HAVE INSURED THEM AGAINST SCHEMES OF FUTURE VENGEANCE THEY PREFERRED AS IS NO DOUBT NATURAL AN INDEPENDENT SECURITY ACCOMPANIED TOO WITH SOVEREIGN POWER TO THE STATION OF SUBJECTS AND THAT NOT ENTIRELY GUARDED FROM ALL APPREHENSIONS OF DANGER 12 THE CONFERENCES WENT NO FURTHER THAN THE FIRST DEMAND ON EACH SIDE
BUT THOUGH FORTUNE SEEMED TO HAVE DIVIDED HER FAVORS BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MAIN A CONSIDERABLE LOSER BY THIS WINTER CAMPAIGN
GENERAL MIDDLETON AT THE HEAD OF SOME ROYALISTS BEING PROSCRIBED BY THE COVENANTERS KEPT IN THE MOUNTAINS EXPECTING SOME OPPORTUNITY OF SERVING HIS MASTER
HIS GREAT COURAGE HIS SIGNAL MILITARY TALENTS HIS EMINENT DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS WERE ALL REQUISITE FOR THIS IMPORTANT ACQUISITION

V DUGDALE P
V DUGDALE P
THAT NOBLEMAN THE ORNAMENT OF THE COURT AND OF HIS ORDER HAD BEEN ENGAGED CONTRARY TO THE NATURAL BENT OF HIS DISPOSITION INTO THESE MILITARY OPERATIONS MERELY BY A HIGH SENSE OF HONOR AND A PERSONAL REGARD TO HIS MASTER
EVEN DURING THE PREVALENCE OF MILTON'S PARTY HE SEEMS NEVER TO HAVE BEEN MUCH REGARDED AND WHITLOCKE TALKS OF ONE MILTON AS HE CALLS HIM A BLIND MAN WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN TRANSLATING A TREATY WITH SWEDEN INTO LATIN
AND CROMWELL KNEW THAT THE INFLAMED MINDS OF THE ROYAL PARTY WERE SUFFICIENTLY DISPOSED TO PUT THE DOCTRINE IN PRACTICE AGAINST HIM
BURNET'S MEM P
NOT ON ANY FAULT OF THE KING'S CHARACTER WHO WAS CANDID SINCERE UPRIGHT
THE FIRST MINISTER WHO PREACHED BEFORE THE KING CHOSE THESE WORDS FOR HIS TEXT
THE IMPUTATION OF INSINCERITY MUST BE GROUNDED ON SOME OF HIS PUBLIC ACTIONS WHICH WE ARE THEREFORE IN THE THIRD PLACE TO EXAMINE
HELD IN THE FIELD A COUNCIL OF WAR
THIS NATIONAL DISCONTENT COMMUNICATED TO A DESPERATE ENTHUSIAST SOON BROKE OUT IN AN EVENT WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS REMARKABLE
AND HE TRAVELLED IN THIS SITUATION TO BENTLEY ATTENDED BY THE PENDERELLS WHO HAD BEEN SO FAITHFUL TO HIM
ALL SOLICITATIONS WERE FOUND FRUITLESS WITH MEN WHOSE RESOLUTIONS WERE FIXED AND IRREVOCABLE
THE KING TO IRELAND
THEY WERE PREPARING A REMONSTRANACE AGAINST THE LEVYING OF TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
THEY FOUND THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSE OPEN
AND IN A WORD THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT DURING A COURSE OF THIRTY YEARS HAD BEEN CHANGED BY MEANS OF THE INNOVATIONS INTRODUCED BY JAMES AND CHARLES
826 827 WHAT RENDERED AN ACCOMMODATION MORE DESPERATE WAS THAT THE DEMANDS ON THESE THREE HEADS HOWEVER EXORBITANT WERE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERS TO BE NOTHING BUT PRELIMINARIES
HAVING ARMED ANEW ESSEX'S SUBDUED BUT NOT DISHEARTENED TROOPS THEY ORDERED MANCHESTER AND CROMWELL TO MARCH WITH THEIR RECRUITED FORCES FROM THE EASTERN ASSOCIATION
BY THE SAME RIGHT ANY OTHER TAX MIGHT BE IMPOSED
A SMALL FLEET WAS THOUGHT SUFFICIENT TO SERVE THE PURPOSES OF THIS EXPEDITION
THEY KEPT THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO SERVE THE KING
AND THEY PRESENTED TO THE KING A LIST OF PERSONS INTRUSTED WITH OFFICES MOST OF THEM INSIGNIFICANT WHO WERE EITHER CONVICTED OR SUSPECTED RECUSANTS IN THIS PARTICULAR THEY HAD PERHAPS SOME REASON TO BLAME THE KING'S CONDUCT
422
422
BUT IT BEING KNOWN THAT THE KING STILL PERSEVERED IN HIS INTENTIONS OF IMPOSING THAT MODE OF WORSHIP MEN FORTIFIED THEMSELVES STILL FURTHER IN THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST IT
AND WAS RECEIVED WITH THE REGARD USUALLY PAID TO FOREIGN PRINCES BY THE FRENCH COURT MAZARINE SENT TO LONDON HIS NEPHEW MANCINI ALONG WITH THE DUKE OF CREQUI
199 200 ETC
396

THE SCOTTISH OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN FORMED IN GERMANY AND IN THE LATE COMMOTIONS CHIEFLY TOOK PART WITH THE PARLIAMENT
560
THOUGH THEY THOUGHT PROPER TO LET THAT BILL SLEEP AT PRESENT IN EXPECTATION OF A MORE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF REVIVING IT AMONG OTHER ACTS OF REGAL EXECUTIVE POWER WHICH THE COMMONS WERE EVERY DAY ASSUMING THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR DEMOLISHING ALL IMAGES ALTARS CRUCIFIXES
180

BUT POLITICS WHICH HAD SO LONG PREVAILED OVER THESE FRIENDLY AFFECTIONS NOW AT LAST YIELDED TO THEIR INFLUENCE
638
CROMWELL AND THE MILITARY COUNCIL PREPARED THEMSELVES WITH VIGOR AND CONDUCT FOR DEFENCE
633
ORDER AND PEACE MAINTAINED
THE JUSTICE OF HIS CAUSE HE KNEW WOULD ENNOBLE ANY FORTUNE
AND HOPED BY SUPPORTING THE PRESBYTERIAN PARTY IN ENGLAND TO SUPPRESS THE SECTARIAN ARMY AND TO REINSTATE THE PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS THE KING IN THEIR JUST FREEDOM AND AUTHORITY
THE MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE WAS ENTIRELY LOST TO THE ROYAL CAUSE
AND THOUGH TREATED WITH CIVILITY AND COURTESY BY ARGYLE A MAN OF PARTS AND ADDRESS HE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A PRISONER AND WAS STILL EXPOSED TO ALL THE RUDENESS AND PEDANTRY OF THE ECCLESIASTICS
AND HAVING BUTCHERED HIM WITH MANY WOUNDS HE AND ALL HIS ATTENDANTS TOOK SHELTER IN THE HOUSE OF THE PORTUGUESE AMBASSADOR WHO HAD CONNIVED AT THIS BASE ENTERPRISE THE POPULACE SURROUNDED THE HOUSE AND THREATENED TO SET FIRE TO IT
EVEN ALL RANKS OF MEN BE LEVELLED
NORTHUMBERLAND AND PEMBROKE WITH THREE COMMONERS PRESENTED THE ADDRESS OF BOTH HOUSES
IT OFFERED A GENERAL AMNESTY TO ALL PERSONS WHATSOEVER
I P

AND HERE I SHOULD PUT OUT MY SECOND LIGHT ETC
NO SHIP IT WAS FOUND WOULD FOR A MONTH SET SAIL FROM BRISTOL EITHER FOR FRANCE OR SPAIN AND THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO GO ELSEWHERE FOR A PASSAGE
MONK WAS A PRUDENT NOT AN ELOQUENT SPEAKER
ONE ROUSE MADE USE OF AN ALLUSION WHICH THOUGH FAMILIAR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM THE WRITINGS OF LORD BACON IF A MAN MEET A DOG ALONE SAID HE THE DOG IS FEARFUL THOUGH EVER SO FIERCE BY NATURE
ALTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES II
IF ONE CLAIM WAS GRANTED THEY HAD ANOTHER READY STILL MORE ENORMOUS AND EXORBITANT
AND LANDLORDS WERE OBLIGED TO USE ALL THE PENALTIES OF LAW AGAINST THEIR TENANTS WHOSE CONSCIENCE WAS SCRUPULOUS FOOTNOTE 24
CHAPTER LVI
THE QUEEN DISPOSING OF THE CROWN JEWELS IN HOLLAND HAD BEEN ENABLED TO PURCHASE A CARGO OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION
THE WRITERS ATTACHED TO THE MEMORY OF THIS WONDERFUL PERSON MAKE HIS CHARACTER WITH REGARD TO ABILITIES BEAR THE AIR OF THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT PANEGYRIC
BUT TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS LIBERTY IF HE COULD NOT PROTECT HIM
TIRED TOO AND SPENT WITH HASTY AND LONG MARCHES IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER THROUGH SNOWY MOUNTAINS UNPROVIDED WITH EVERY NECESSARY THEY FELL OFF AND LEFT THEIR GENERAL ALMOST ALONE WITH THE IRISH WHO HAVING NO PLACE TO WHICH THEY COULD RETIRE STILL ADHERED TO HIM IN EVERY FORTUNE
52 DUGDALE P
THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
ALL THESE VIRTUES IN HIM MAINTAINED THEIR PROPER BOUNDS AND MERITED UNRESERVED PRAISE
IN OPPOSITION TO THESE ARGUMENTS IT WAS URGED BY THE MALECONTENT PARTY THAT THE COURT HAD DISCOVERED ON THEIR PART BUT FEW SYMPTOMS OF THAT MUTUAL CONFIDENCE TO WHICH THEY NOW SO KINDLY INVITED THE COMMONS
IF YOU SAW HOW UNMANLY AND UNCHRISTIAN THE IMPLACABLE DISPOSITION IS IN OUR ILL-WISHERS YOU WOULD AVOID THAT SPIRIT
HE ADVISED CHARLES RATHER TO PUT ALL TO HAZARD THAN SUBMIT TO UNWORTHY TERMS AS WERE LIKELY TO BE IMPOSED UPON HIM
THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW AS MUCH AS THE MOST FLAMING COURT SERMON INCULCATES PASSIVE OBEDIENCE IS APPARENT
BUT THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSED UPON THE REST OF THE NATION UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES NO LESS THAN PUTTING ALL WHO REFUSED OUT OF THE PROTECTION OF LAW SUCH OBSTINATE RELUCTANCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE PEOPLE THAT EVEN THE IMPERIOUS PARLIAMENT WAS OBLIGED TO DESIST FROM IT
AND THOUGH THEIR PRINCIPLES WERE ON ALL OCCASIONS EASILY WARPED AND ELUDED BY PRIVATE INTEREST YET WAS SOME COLORING REQUISITE AND A FLAT CONTRADICTION TO ALL FORMER PROFESSIONS AND TENETS COULD NOT SAFELY BE PROPOSED TO THEM
BUT THAT HE FOUND INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES IN RECONCILING TO IT THE WILD HUMORS OF THE ARMY
AND THE GENERAL EXPECTATIONS WERE HERE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED CHARLES FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE BY SOME DECISIVE ADVANTAGE TO REDUCE THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO A REASONABLE SUBMISSION AND MIGHT THEN EXPECT WITH SECURITY THE MEETING OF A SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
AND HOWEVER MODERATE HIS TEMPER THE NATURAL AND UNAVOIDABLE PREPOSSESSIONS OF SELF-LOVE JOINED TO THE LATE UNIFORM PRECEDENTS IN FAVOR OF PREROGATIVE HAD MADE HIM REGARD HIS POLITICAL TENETS AS CERTAIN AND UNCONTROVERTED
845 859
HE WAS PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR PREACHERS ON WHOM ALL DEPENDED
ESSEX HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM MILITARY STORES
AS THESE QUALITIES DID IN REALITY EMBELLISH THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE AUTHOR
AND HE HAD EVEN PRETENDED TO HONOR MANY OF THEM WITH HIS INTIMATE FRIENDSHIP WHILE HE CONDUCTED HIS DARING ENTERPRISES AGAINST THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT
AND BY FORCE OF GENIUS WITHOUT ANY MASTER HE SOON BECAME AN EXCELLENT OFFICER

BESIDES GRANTING TO THE KING A SUPPLY FROM THE SPIRITUALITY AND FRAMING MANY CANONS THE CONVOCATION JEALOUS OF LIKE INNOVATIONS WITH THOSE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN SCOTLAND IMPOSED AN OATH ON THE CLERGY AND THE GRADUATES IN THE UNIVERSITIES BY WHICH EVERY ONE SWORE TO MAINTAIN THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH BY ARCHBISHOPS BISHOPS DEANS CHAPTERS ETC THESE STEPS IN THE PRESENT DISCONTENTED HUMOR OF THE NATION WERE COMMONLY DEEMED ILLEGAL
AND A TREATY COMMENCED BUT WITHOUT ANY CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AS HAD AT FIRST BEEN PROPOSED
AND AS THE VERY FEW ALTERATIONS WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE NEW LITURGY FROM THE ENGLISH SEEMED TO APPROACH NEARER TO THE DOCTRINE OF THE REAL PRESENCE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS DEEMED AN UNDOUBTED CONFIRMATION OF EVERY SUSPICION WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE WERE POSSESSED CLARENDON VOL
AND ALL THIS FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF GOD AND THE GREATER HONOR AND ADVANTAGE OF THEIR KING AND COUNTRY THE PEOPLE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF RANK OR CONDITION OF AGE OR SEX FLOCKED TO THE SUBSCRIPTION OF THIS COVENANT
SO LOUD WERE THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST REGAL USURPATIONS THAT HAD THE KING ASSERTED THE PREROGATIVE OF SUPPLYING BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY THE DEFICIENCIES IN GOVERNMENT ARISING FROM THE OBSTINACY OF THE COMMONS HE WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE CLAMORS WITH WHICH THE WHOLE NATION ALREADY RESOUNDED
ALL THESE CAUSES GAVE THEIR AUTHORITY TO THE NEW PRINCIPLES PROPAGATED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND PROTECTOR WITH FRANCE HAD BEEN VARIOUS AND COMPLICATED
IN PROPORTION AS THE TERROR OF THE KING'S POWER DIMINISHED THE DIVISION BETWEEN INDEPENDENT AND PRESBYTERIAN BECAME EVERY DAY MORE APPARENT
ABOVE NINETY ADDRESSES FROM THE COUNTIES AND MOST CONSIDERABLE CORPORATIONS CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS ACCESSION IN ALL THE TERMS OF DUTIFUL ALLEGIANCE
THE SUPPLY THOUGH VOTED WAS NOT AS YET PASSED INTO A LAW
IT SAVORED AS THEY PRETENDED OF POPISH SUPERSTITION
THAT IF THE FORCE OF SPAIN WERE REALLY SO EXORBITANT AS THE COMMONS IMAGINED THE FRENCH MONARCH WAS THE ONLY PRINCE THAT COULD OPPOSE ITS PROGRESS AND PRESERVE THE BALANCE OF EUROPE
LOCKHART STILL REPLIED THAT HIS COMMISSION WAS DERIVED FROM AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND HE WOULD NOT OPEN HIS GATES BUT IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SAME AUTHORITY THIS SCRUPLE THOUGH IN THE PRESENT EMERGENCE IT APPROACHES TOWARDS SUPERSTITION IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US ENTIRELY TO CONDEMN
ANOTHER OF NEARLY THE SAME FORCE UNDER WALLER WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF LONDON
HE SEIZED THE RINGLEADERS BEFORE THEIR COMPANIONS
FULLY SENSIBLE OF THE EXCESSES TO WHICH AFFAIRS HAD BEEN CARRIED AND OF THE WORSE CONSEQUENCES WHICH WERE STILL TO BE APPREHENDED HE HAD RESOLVED TO CONCILIATE A PEACE AND TO REMEDY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ALL THOSE ILLS TO WHICH FROM MISTAKE RATHER THAN ANY BAD INTENTIONS HE HAD HIMSELF SO MUCH CONTRIBUTED
WHILE CROMWELL ALLURED THE KING BY THESE EXPECTATIONS HE STILL CONTINUED HIS SCHEME OF REDUCING THE PARLIAMENT TO SUBJECTION AND DEPRIVING THEM OF ALL MEANS OF RESISTANCE
EVERY DISCRETIONARY OR ARBITRARY SENTENCE OF THE STAR CHAMBER AND HIGH COMMISSION COURTS WHICH FROM THEIR VERY CONSTITUTION WERE ARBITRARY UNDERWENT A SEVERE SCRUTINY
AND THE KING REDUCED HIS ALLOWANCE TO FOUR THOUSAND MEN
THOUGH TRANSPORTED HIMSELF WITH THE MOST FRANTIC WHIMSEYS CROMWELL HAD ADOPTED A SCHEME FOR REGULATING THIS PRINCIPLE IN OTHERS WHICH WAS SAGACIOUS AND POLITICAL
THE LOSS SUSTAINED AT NEWBURN HE SAID WAS INCONSIDERABLE AND THOUGH A PANIC HAD FOR THE TIME SEIZED THE ARMY THAT EVENT WAS NOTHING STRANGE AMONG NEW LEVIED TROOPS AND THE SCOTS BEING IN THE SAME CONDITION WOULD NO DOUBT BE LIABLE IN THEIR TURN TO A LIKE ACCIDENT
BUT TO SHOW THE PARLIAMENT THAT HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY APPRISED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS GRANT HE OBSERVED TO THEM THAT THIS STATUTE ALTERED IN A GREAT MEASURE THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS ECCLESIASTICAL AND CIVIL WHICH MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS HAD ESTABLISHED CLARENDON VOL
BESIDES THE LARGE PAY VOTED THEM FOR LYING IN GOOD QUARTERS DURING A TWELVEMONTH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT HAD CONFERRED ON THEM A PRESENT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE IN THE ARTICLES OF PACIFICATION THEY WERE DECLARED TO HAVE EVER BEEN GOOD SUBJECTS
26 30
THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN BY WHICH THE CAPITAL WAS COMMANDED CONTAINED ARMS FOR TEN THOUSAND MEN WITH THIRTY-FIVE PIECES OF CANNON AND A PROPORTIONABLE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION
67
HAVING RECEIVED THE FIRE OF THE ENEMY WHICH WAS ANSWERED CHIEFLY BY A VOLLEY OF STONES HE RUSHED AMIDST THEM WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN THREW THEM INTO CONFUSION PUSHED HIS ADVANTAGE AND OBTAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF TWO THOUSAND OF THE COVENANTERS THIS VICTORY THOUGH IT AUGMENTED THE RENOWN OF MONTROSE INCREASED NOT HIS POWER OR NUMBERS
DURING THE LATE MILITARY OPERATIONS SEVERAL POWERS HAD BEEN EXERCISED BY THE LIEUTENANTS AND DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF COUNTIES
THE OPPOSITION WHICH CROMWELL DREADED WAS NOT THAT WHICH CAME FROM LAMBERT AND HIS ADHERENTS WHOM HE NOW REGARDED AS CAPITAL ENEMIES AND WHOM HE WAS RESOLVED ON THE FIRST OCCASION TO DEPRIVE OF ALL POWER AND AUTHORITY
BESIDES WHAT FURTHER PUNISHMENT IT SHOULD PLEASE THE ENSUING PARLIAMENT TO INFLICT ON THE REFUSERS AS ENEMIES TO GOD TO THE KING AND TO THE KINGDOM
BUT THEY HAD STILL MANY PREJUDICES TO OVERCOME MANY FEARS AND JEALOUSIES TO BE ALLAYED ERE THEY COULD CORDIALLY ENTERTAIN THOUGHTS OF RESTORING THE FAMILY WHICH THEY HAD SO GRIEVOUSLY OFFENDED AND WHOSE PRINCIPLES THEY REGARDED WITH SUCH VIOLENT ABHORRENCE
HE SAT DOWN FOR SOME TIME AND HEARD THE DEBATE
THESE WERE IN SCOTLAND THE TOPICS OF EVERY CONVERSATION
THE SHIPPING OF THE KINGDOM AUGMENTED A HUNDRED FOLD THE CUSTOMS TRIPLED UPON THE SAME RATES
BUT THE MOST FATAL BLOW GIVEN TO ROYAL AUTHORITY AND WHAT IN A MANNER DETHRONED THE PRINCE WAS THE ARTICLE THAT NO MEMBER OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL IN WHOSE HANDS DURING THE KING'S ABSENCE THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION LAY NO OFFICER OF STATE NONE OF THE JUDGES SHOULD BE APPOINTED BUT BY ADVICE AND APPROBATION OF PARLIAMENT
SEE ALSO CARTE'S COLLECTION VOL

SIR JACOB ASTLEY THE FOOT
A SMALL COMMITTEE ON WHOM THE TWO HOUSES DEVOLVED THEIR POWER HAD DIRECTED ALL THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS AND HAD PRESERVED A SECRECY IN DELIBERATION AND A PROMPTITUDE IN EXECUTION BEYOND WHAT THE KING NOTWITHSTANDING THE ADVANTAGES POSSESSED BY A SINGLE LEADER HAD EVER BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN
HIS DISTRESSED SITUATION HE COULD NO LONGER ASCRIBE TO THE RIGORS OF DESTINY OR THE MALIGNITY OF ENEMIES
SIR HARRY VANE SIR HARRY VANE
BY THE DEBATES ON THIS SUBJECT IT APPEARED BEYOND CONTROVERSY TO THE NATION THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BEEN SO JEALOUS OF PERSONAL LIBERTY AS TO SECURE IT AGAINST ARBITRARY POWER IN THE CROWN BY SIX SEVERAL STATUTES AND BY AN ARTICLE OF THE GREAT CHARTER ITSELF THE MOST SACRED FOUNDATION OF THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION
THEY ASSERTED THAT THOSE PARTS OF THE KINGDOM WHICH HAD FROM THEIR OWN AUTHORITY PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE DURING THESE PREVAILING FEARS AND JEALOUSIES HAD ACTED SUITABLY TO THE DECLARATIONS AND DIRECTIONS OF BOTH HOUSES AND CONFORMABLY TO THE LAWS OF THE KINGDOM
ESSEX HAD NOW RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
BUT WHAT A CONTRAST WHEN WE PASS TO THE PROTECTOR'S REPLIES
THE CHIEF CRIME OF NERO HE REPRESENTS TO HAVE BEEN HIS FREQUENTING AND ACTING OF PLAYS
THROUGHOUT THE NATION THEY STILL LAY UNDER THE REPROACH OF INNOVATION AND HERESY
NOR WOULD SUCH IMMEDIATE DANGER ENSUE FROM THAT CONCESSION TO THE LAWS AND TO THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE
THESE THE FRENCH COURT HAD PRETENDED THEY WOULD EMPLOY AGAINST THE GENOESE WHO BEING FIRM AND USEFUL ALLIES TO THE SPANISH MONARCHY WERE NATURALLY REGARDED WITH AN EVIL EYE BOTH BY THE KING OF FRANCE AND OF ENGLAND
THE MARSHAL'S COURT WHICH TOOK COGNIZANCE OF OFFENSIVE WORDS AND WAS NOT THOUGHT SUFFICIENTLY LIMITED BY LAW WAS ALSO FOR THAT REASON ABOLISHED THE STANNARY COURTS WHICH EXERCISED JURISDICTION OVER THE MINERS BEING LIABLE TO A LIKE OBJECTION UNDERWENT A LIKE FATE
AND EXCEPTING HULL THE PARLIAMENT WAS MASTER OF NO GARRISON IN THESE QUARTERS
WILMOT A MAN OF DISSOLUTE MANNERS HAD PROMOTED THE SAME SPIRIT OF DISORDER
FROM ALL QUARTERS OF ENGLAND THE PRIME NOBILITY AND GENTRY EITHER PERSONALLY OR BY MESSAGES AND LETTERS EXPRESSED THEIR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
THEY HAD ORDERS NOT TO INFORM HAMMOND OF THE PLACE WHERE THE KING WAS CONCEALED TILL THEY HAD FIRST OBTAINED A PROMISE FROM HIM NOT TO DELIVER UP HIS MAJESTY THOUGH THE PARLIAMENT AND THE ARMY SHOULD REQUIRE HIM
WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO SUCH EXTREME RAGE AGAINST CHARLES WHO FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN WISHED ONLY TO MAINTAIN SUCH A GOVERNMENT
IT SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IN THE CONTROVERTED PARTS OF HISTORY TO SAY ANY THING WHICH WILL SATISFY THE ZEALOTS OF BOTH PARTIES
EVEN A WRITER SUCH AS SELDEN WHOSE LEARNING WAS HIS CHIEF EXCELLENCY OR CHILLINGWORTH AN ACUTE DISPUTANT AGAINST THE PAPISTS WILL SCARCELY BE RANKED AMONG THE CLASSICS OF OUR LANGUAGE OR COUNTRY
NEVER WAS SOVEREIGN BLESSED WITH MORE MODERATION OF TEMPER WITH MORE JUSTICE MORE HUMANITY MORE HONOR OR A MORE GENTLE DISPOSITION
AND YOU ARE ONLY SEEKING A CORKSCREW AMIDST ALL THE UNGUARDED PLAY AND BUFFOONERY OF THIS SINGULAR PERSONAGE HE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF REMARKING THE CHARACTERS DESIGNS AND WEAKNESSES OF MEN
AND BY THUS UNITING IN HIS PERSON THE MOST OPPOSITE TALENTS HE WAS ENABLED TO COMBINE THE MOST CONTRARY INTERESTS IN A SUBSERVIENCY TO HIS SECRET PURPOSES
THE CLERGY MADE GREAT LAMENTATIONS AND TOLD THE LORD THAT TO THEM IT WAS LITTLE TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES AND ESTATES BUT TO HIM IT WAS A GREAT LOSS TO SUFFER HIS ELECT TO BE DESTROYED THEY PUBLISHED A DECLARATION CONTAINING THE CAUSE OF THEIR LATE MISFORTUNES
HE HIMSELF WAS OVERHEARD OFFERING UP HIS ADDRESSES TO HEAVEN
GREAT DISGUSTS ALSO ON OTHER ACCOUNTS HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THE NATIONS
AND BY THE SAME ACT THE PROTECTOR WAS BY EVERY ONE CONSIDERED AS EFFECTUALLY DETHRONED
AND HE THREATENED STILL FURTHER VENGEANCE
THE INDEPENDENTS WERE RESOLUTE TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
THEY RENEWED THEIR FORMER ORDERS FOR ENLISTING TROOPS
COMMISSIONERS WERE APPOINTED FOR FIXING THE RATES OF COMPOSITION
THAT THEY SHOULD RESIDE CONSTANTLY IN THEIR DIOCESE AND BE BOUND TO PREACH EVERY SUNDAY
AFTER COMMUNICATING TO THEM THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED HE INFORMED THEM THAT THE INSURRECTION WAS NOT IN HIS OPINION THE RESULT OF ANY RASH ENTERPRISE BUT OF A FORMED CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE CROWN OF ENGLAND
THE AUTHORITY IN THE NATION EVER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN PURGED BY THE ARMY WAS EXTREMELY DIMINISHED
IN THEIR DECLARATION THEY MADE NO MENTION OF THE KING
AND AS THESE OFFICERS LAY ALL UNDER THE GRIEVOUS REPROACH OF DESERTING THE ARMY AND BETRAYING THE INTERESTS OF THEIR COMPANIONS THE REST WERE FURTHER CONFIRMED IN THAT CONFEDERACY WHICH THEY HAD SECRETLY FORMED TO PETITION AND REMONSTRATE BEING THE MOST CAUTIOUS METHOD OF CONDUCTING A CONFEDERACY AN APPLICATION TO PARLIAMENT WAS SIGNED BY NEAR TWO HUNDRED OFFICERS IN WHICH THEY MADE THEIR APOLOGY WITH A VERY IMPERIOUS AIR ASSERTED THEIR RIGHT OF PETITIONING AND COMPLAINED OF THAT IMPUTATION THROWN UPON THEM BY THE FORMER DECLARATION OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PRIVATE MEN LIKEWISE OF SOME REGIMENTS SENT A LETTER TO SKIPPON IN WHICH TOGETHER WITH INSISTING ON THE SAME TOPICS THEY LAMENT THAT DESIGNS WERE FORMED AGAINST THEM AND MANY OF THE GODLY PARTY IN THE KINGDOM
J
A PETITION FROM THE APPRENTICES WAS GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED NAY ONE WAS ENCOURAGED FROM THE PORTERS WHOSE NUMBERS AMOUNTED AS THEY SAID TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE ADDRESS OF THAT GREAT BODY CONTAINED THE SAME ARTICLES WITH ALL THE OTHERS
AND IT WAS MATTER OF COMPLAINT THAT IT ENCROACHED UPON THE JURISDICTION OF THE OTHER COURTS
THEY EXCITED AFRESH THEIR PREACHERS TO FURIOUS DECLAMATIONS AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE
THE PARLIAMENT REFUSED THEIR ASSENT TO THAT DECISION SELDEN WHITLOCKE AND OTHER POLITICAL REASONERS ASSISTED BY THE INDEPENDENTS HAD PREVAILED IN THIS IMPORTANT DELIBERATION
AND HE BECAME THE CHIEF LEADER OF THAT PARTY
202
AND THAT WHOEVER SHOULD ASSIST HIM IN SUCH A WAR WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX
261 262
AND THAT ON THE SAME DAY LORD MAGUIRE AND ROGER MORE SHOULD SURPRISE THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN
BUT SHALL NOT I TRUST BE HEREAFTER SLAVES
ON SUCH FIRM FOUNDATIONS WAS BUILT THE CREDIT OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN THAT THOUGH A GREAT MASTER OF FRAUD AND DISSIMULATION HE JUDGED IT SUPERFLUOUS TO EMPLOY ANY DISGUISE IN CONDUCTING THIS BOLD ENTERPRISE
BESIDES AN IMPOSITION LEVIED IN LONDON AMOUNTING TO THE FIVE-AND-TWENTIETH PART OF EVERY ONE'S SUBSTANCE THEY ESTABLISHED ON THAT CITY A WEEKLY ASSESSMENT OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS AND ANOTHER OF TWENTY-THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN ON THE REST OF THE KINGDOM AND AS THEIR AUTHORITY WAS AT PRESENT ESTABLISHED IN MOST COUNTIES THEY LEVIED THESE TAXES WITH REGULARITY
THEIR VIOLATIONS OF LAW PARTICULARLY THOSE OF CHARLES ARE IN SOME FEW INSTANCES TRANSGRESSIONS OF A PLAIN LIMIT WHICH WAS MARKED OUT TO LOYAL AUTHORITY
THE MAN HAD DIGNITY OF SENTIMENTS MUCH ABOVE HIS CONDITION AND THOUGH DEATH WAS DENOUNCED AGAINST ALL WHO CONCEALED THE KING AND A GREAT REWARD PROMISED TO ANY ONE WHO SHOULD BETRAY HIM HE PROFESSED AND MAINTAINED UNSHAKEN FIDELITY
WHO AT ONCE ESTABLISHED HIS AUTHORITY IN THE FLEET AND KEPT THE ENTIRE DOMINION OF THE SEA IN THE HANDS OF THAT ASSEMBLY
LAMBERT'S AUTHORITY IN THE ARMY TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERY BODY WAS FOUND IMMEDIATELY TO EXPIRE WITH THE LOSS OF HIS COMMISSION
AND HE NOW OPENLY IN THE CHURCH THOUGH INVESTED WITH THE HIGHEST CIVIL CHARACTER IN THE KINGDOM DID PENANCE FOR HIS OBEDIENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HE TERMED A CARNAL SELF-SEEKING HE ACCOMPANIED HIS PENANCE WITH SO MANY TEARS AND SUCH PATHETICAL ADDRESSES TO THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR PRAYERS IN THIS HIS UTTERMOST SORROW AND DISTRESS THAT A UNIVERSAL WEEPING AND LAMENTATION TOOK PLACE AMONG THE DELUDED AUDIENCE THE LOAN OF GREAT SUMS OF MONEY OFTEN TO THE RUIN OF FAMILIES WAS EXACTED FROM ALL SUCH AS LAY UNDER ANY SUSPICION OF FAVORING THE KING'S PARTY THOUGH THEIR CONDUCT HAD BEEN EVER SO INOFFENSIVE
BUT THOSE WHO FAVOR THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT IN CHURCH OR STATE SHOULD NOT PETITION
HE WAS FURTHER DISGUSTED AT THE EXTREMITIES INTO WHICH HE HAD ALREADY BEEN HURRIED
AND ITS AUTHORITY EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE KINGDOM

A WATERMAN BELONGING TO A MAN OF QUALITY HAVING A SQUABBLE WITH A CITIZEN ABOUT HIS FARE SHOWED HIS BADGE THE CREST OF HIS MASTER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A SWAN
SO VIOLENT A MEASURE WAS SUPPORTED BY A DECLARATION OF THE COMMONS NO LESS VIOLENT
BY A FORCED MARCH DURING THE NIGHT HE REACHED CIRENCESTER AND OBTAINED THE DOUBLE ADVANTAGE OF PASSING UNMOLESTED AN OPEN COUNTRY AND OF SURPRISING A CONVOY OF PROVISIONS WHICH LAY IN THAT TOWN WITHOUT DELAY HE PROCEEDED TOWARDS LONDON
THIS MEASURE WAS FORESEEN AND LITTLE REGARDED

IN THIS DISPOSITION WAS THE ARMY FOUND BY WARWICK DACRES MASSEY AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS WHO WERE SENT TO MAKE THEM PROPOSALS FOR ENTERING INTO THE SERVICE OF IRELAND INSTEAD OF ENLISTING THE GENERALITY OBJECTED TO THE TERMS
BY REMOVING THE STAR CHAMBER THE KING'S POWER OF BINDING THE PEOPLE BY HIS PROCLAMATIONS WAS INDIRECTLY ABOLISHED
OR RATHER OF DESIGNS FORMED FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF ALL THEIR LIBERTIES AND PRIVILEGES
HE ATTACKED THE LATTER BY SURPRISE NEAR PRESTON IN LANCASHIRE
AND WHAT PROBABLY AFFECTED CHARLES STILL MORE THEY WERE PROCEEDING TO RATIFY THE ACTS OF ASSEMBLY WHEN BY THE KING'S INSTRUCTIONS TRAQUAIRE THE COMMISSIONER PROROGUED THEM
THE EXECUTION OF THE SEVERE AND BLOODY LAWS AGAINST PRIESTS WAS INSISTED ON
35 36 ETC
AND THOUGH THE KING OFFERED TO MARRY THE CARDINAL'S NIECE HE COULD FOR THE PRESENT OBTAIN NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROFUSIONS OF RESPECT AND PROTESTATIONS OF SERVICES
HE SAID THAT THIS REQUEST WAS THE FIRST THAT HE HAD EVER MADE THEM
SOME HISTORIANS HAVE RASHLY QUESTIONED THE GOOD FAITH OF THIS PRINCE
HE REPLIED THAT AS THE PAPER SENT HIM NEITHER CONTAINED ANY ADDRESS TO THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT NOR ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR AUTHORITY HE COULD NOT COMMUNICATE IT TO THEM
AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT ANOTHER PARLIAMENT WOULD REMEMBER HOW USEFUL A KING'S POWER IS TO A PEOPLE'S LIBERTY
ALL ENCROACHMENTS ON SUPREME POWER COULD ONLY BE RESISTED SUCCESSFULLY ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT
MADE ANOTHER FRUITLESS JOURNEY WITH NEW CONCESSIONS TO EDINBURGH
THE COURAGE OF THE OFFICERS WAS SO WELL SECONDED BY THE SOLDIERS THAT THE ROYALISTS BEGAN ON ALL SIDES TO GAIN GROUND
WINCHESTER CAPITULATED
THE ENTHUSIASTIC GENIUS OF YOUNG VANE EXTRAVAGANT IN THE ENDS WHICH HE PURSUED SAGACIOUS AND PROFOUND IN THE MEANS WHICH HE EMPLOYED

A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS TEN POUNDS FOR EACH LORD FORTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH COMMONER
IT DEPRIVED THE KING OF THE MINISTERS WHOM HE MOST TRUSTED
I BESEECH YOU IN THE BOWELS OF CHRIST SEARCH AFTER THE MIND OF THE LORD IN IT TOWARDS YOU AND WE SHALL HELP YOU BY OUR PRAYERS THAT YOU MAY FIND IT
THIS REASONING SHOWS THE KING'S GOOD SENSE AND PROVES THAT HIS ATTACHMENT TO EPISCOPACY THOUGH PARTLY FOUNDED ON RELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES WAS ALSO IN HIS SITUATION DERIVED FROM THE SOUNDEST VIEWS OF CIVIL POLICY
THE PEOPLE WERE DISTRACTED IN THEIR CHOICE

AND WHILE THEY PRETENDED TO BESTOW NEW LIBERTIES UPON THE NATION THEY FOUND THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO INFRINGE EVEN THE MOST VALUABLE OF THOSE WHICH THROUGH TIME IMMEMORIAL HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED FROM THEIR ANCESTORS
HE ISSUED A DECLARATION SUCH AS THEY REQUIRED OF HIM HE THERE GAVE THANKS FOR THE MERCIFUL DISPENSATIONS OF PROVIDENCE BY WHICH HE WAS RECOVERED FROM THE SNARE OF EVIL COUNSEL HAD ATTAINED A FULL PERSUASION OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE COVENANT AND WAS INDUCED TO CAST HIMSELF AND HIS INTERESTS WHOLLY UPON GOD
THE ASSEMBLY OF DIVINES HAD VOTED PRESBYTERY TO BE OF DIVINE RIGHT
THE AUTHORITY OF THE CONVOCATION WAS INDEED IN MOST RESPECTS INDEPENDENT OF THE PARLIAMENT
MOST OF THE HOUSE ACCOMPANIED HIM ON SO AGREEABLE AN ERRAND
HORSE-RACES AND COCK-MATCHES WERE PROHIBITED AS THE GREATEST ENORMITIES KILLING NO MURDER EVEN BEAR-BAITING WAS ESTEEMED HEATHENISH AND UNCHRISTIAN
MORDAUNT BROTHER TO THE EARL OF PETERBOROUGH NARROWLY ESCAPED
AND THOUGH THEY HAD FORMERLY VOTED HIS CONCESSIONS WITH REGARD TO THE CHURCH AND DELINQUENTS TO BE UNSATISFACTORY THEY NOW TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FINAL RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO THE WHOLE
THE PARLIAMENT THEY WERE RESOLVED SHOULD SHARE WITH THEM THE REPROACH OF A MEASURE WHICH WAS THOUGHT REQUISITE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR COMMON ENDS OF SAFETY AND AMBITION

IN ANSWER TO HAMILTON'S DEMAND OF RENOUNCING THE COVENANT THEY PLAINLY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WOULD SOONER RENOUNCE THEIR BAPTISM AND THE CLERGY INVITED THE COMMISSIONER HIMSELF TO SUBSCRIBE IT BY INFORMING HIM WITH WHAT PEACE AND COMFORT IT HAD FILLED THE HEARTS OF ALL GOD'S PEOPLE
BUT THE EMPLOYING SO LONG THE PLEA OF A NECESSITY WHICH APPEARED DISTANT AND DOUBTFUL RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF A NECESSITY WHICH WAS NOW AT LAST BECOME REAL URGENT AND INEVITABLE
94
THE SOLE INFERENCE WHICH HIS PARTISANS WERE ENTITLED TO DRAW FROM THE SUBMISSIONS SO FRANKLY MADE TO PRESENT NECESSITY WAS THAT HE HAD CERTAINLY ADOPTED A NEW PLAN OF GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE FUTURE WAS RESOLVED BY EVERY INDULGENCE TO ACQUIRE THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE
342 PARL
ASSUMED DIFFERENT DISGUISES
AFTER THE ROYAL ARMY WAS RECRUITED AND REFRESHED AS THE WEATHER STILL CONTINUED FAVORABLE IT WAS AGAIN PUT IN MOTION A PARTY OF HORSE APPROACHED TO READING OF WHICH MARTIN WAS APPOINTED GOVERNOR BY THE PARLIAMENT
THE NOBILITY AND MORE CONSIDERABLE GENTRY DREADING A TOTAL CONFUSION OF RANK FROM THE FURY OF THE POPULACE ENLISTED THEMSELVES IN DEFENCE OF THE MONARCH FROM WHOM THEY RECEIVED AND TO WHOM THEY COMMUNICATED THEIR LUSTRE
THE VIEWS OF THE POPULAR LEADERS WERE MUCH MORE JUDICIOUS AND PROFOUND
AND HAVING BY HIS RESOLUTE BEHAVIOR OBTAINED THE HIGHEST CONFIDENCE OF THE ROYAL PARTY HE WAS NOW BECOME THE CENTRE OF ALL THEIR CONSPIRACIES
AND IN THIS SITUATION CARRYING MORE SHOW THAN REAL FORCE WITH IT THE CAMP ARRIVED AT BERWICK THE SCOTTISH ARMY WAS AS NUMEROUS AS THAT OF THE KING BUT INFERIOR IN CAVALRY
ALL THE DOCTRINES WHICH THE ROMISH CHURCH HAD BORROWED FROM SOME OF THE FATHERS AND WHICH FREED THE SPIRITUAL FROM SUBORDINATION TO THE CIVIL POWER WERE NOW ADOPTED BY THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND INTERWOVEN WITH HER POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS TENETS
AND RESOLVED THAT THE CROWN WHICH HE INTENDED TO RESTORE SHOULD BE CONFERRED ON THE KING ENTIRELY FREE AND UNENCUMBERED
AND WAS REDUCED TO GREAT DIFFICULTIES
AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT MARTIN A ZEALOUS REPUBLICAN IN THE DEBATE ON THIS QUESTION CONFESSED THAT IF THEY DESIRED A KING THE LAST WAS AS PROPER AS ANY GENTLEMAN IN ENGLAND THE COMMONS ORDERED A NEW GREAT SEAL TO BE ENGRAVED ON WHICH THAT ASSEMBLY WAS REPRESENTED WITH THIS LEGEND ON THE FIRST YEAR OF FREEDOM BY GOD'S BLESSING RESTORED 1648 THE FORMS OF ALL PUBLIC BUSINESS WERE CHANGED FROM THE KING'S NAME TO THAT OF THE KEEPERS OF THE LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND AND IT WAS DECLARED HIGH TREASON TO PROCLAIM OR ANY OTHERWISE ACKNOWLEDGE CHARLES STUART COMMONLY CALLED PRINCE OF WALES
BUT IT WAS SOON OBSERVED THAT THE ONLY USE WHICH THEY MADE OF THEIR FUNDS WAS TO ESTABLISH LECTURERS IN ALL THE CONSIDERABLE CHURCHES
THEY PRONOUNCED HIS DAMNATION AND ASSURED HIM THAT THE JUDGMENT WHICH HE WAS SO SOON TO SUFFER WOULD PROVE BUT AN EASY PROLOGUE TO THAT WHICH HE MUST UNDERGO HEREAFTER
THIS BEHAVIOR GAVE FRESH PROVOCATION TO THE STAR CHAMBER
BUT THIS BLEMISH IS MORE TO BE REGARDED AS A GENERAL IMPUTATION ON THE WHOLE AGE THAN ANY PARTICULAR FAILING OF LAUD'S
THE ROYALISTS WERE DESIROUS OF THROWING A RIDICULE ON THIS FANATICISM OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMIES WITHOUT BEING SENSIBLE HOW MUCH REASON THEY HAD TO APPREHEND ITS DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES
RUSH WORTH VOL
A TOTAL CONJUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT PRIVILEGES INTERESTS AND COUNCILS
IF THIS ESTIMATION ITSELF BE NOT AS IS USUAL IN SUCH CASES SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED
AND THE COMMONS REAPED THIS MULTIPLIED ADVANTAGE BY THEIR VOTE
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WAS CONSTITUTED IN THE SAME MANNER
AND THEY GLADLY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH THEY SOUGHT OF MAKING WAR UPON THE STATES
THE DOOM BEING LOCKED THE GENTLEMAN USHER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHO WAS SENT BY THE KING COULD NOT GET ADMITTANCE TILL THIS REMONSTRANCE WAS FINISHED
BOTH SIDES WERE NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THEY MUST AGAIN RENEW THE COMBAT FOR THAT VICTORY WHICH EACH OF THEM THOUGHT THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF LAMBERT THEY SENT ORDERS TO THE FORCES UNDER HIS COMMAND IMMEDIATELY TO REPAIR TO THOSE QUARTERS WHICH WERE APPOINTED THEM
SURELY WE FEAR BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A MERCIFUL AND A GRACIOUS DELIVERANCE TO US
IMMEDIATELY HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUPPORT OF THE KING'S FALLING AUTHORITY AND WAS PREVAILED WITH TO BE GOVERNOR TO THE YOUNG PRINCE AND RESIDE AT COURT
THE PARLIAMENT HAD RECOURSE TO SCOTLAND
HOWEVER PLAUSIBLE THESE TOPICS THEY MADE SMALL IMPRESSION ON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THEY REPRESENTED THAT ANY DELAY DURING DANGERS AND DISTRACTIONS SO GREAT AND PRESSING WAS NOT LESS UNSATISFACTORY AND DESTRUCTIVE THAN AN ABSOLUTE DENIAL
AND THOUGHT THAT SUPPLY ON THIS OCCASION OUGHT BOTH IN REASON AND IN DECENCY TO GO BEFORE GRIEVANCES
251
251
PRINCE RUPERT APPROACHED THE TOWN BY ANOTHER QUARTER AND INTERPOSING THE RIVER OUSE BETWEEN HIM AND THE ENEMY SAFELY JOINED HIS FORCES TO THOSE OF NEWCASTLE
MEM
THE KINGDOM WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE FORMER PARTY
THEY WILL CUT OFF MY HEAD
THE PARLIAMENT DEMANDED THAT THE TRUCE WITH THE REBELS SHOULD BE DECLARED NULL
13TH OF FEBRUARY 1645
WITH WHICH THOUGH MUCH INFERIOR TO HIS WANTS HE DECLARED HIMSELF WELL SATISFIED
AND FUNDS WERE ASSIGNED FOR THEIR SUPPORT
THE MAJORITY OF THE PARLIAMENT BY MEANS OF THESE ARTS AND VIOLENCES WAS NOW AT LAST EITHER FRIENDLY TO THE PROTECTOR OR RESOLVED BY THEIR COMPLIANCE TO ADJUST IF POSSIBLE THIS MILITARY GOVERNMENT TO THEIR LAWS AND LIBERTIES
NOR IS THERE ANY DANGER THAT MANKIND BY THIS PRUDENT RESERVE SHOULD UNIVERSALLY DEGENERATE INTO A STATE OF ABJECT SERVITUDE

A LITTLE AFTER WRITS WERE ISSUED FOR SUMMONING THIS PARLIAMENT A COMMISSION HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SIR THOMAS COVENTRY LORD KEEPER THE EARL OF MARLBOROUGH TREASURER THE EARL OF MANCHESTER PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL THE EARL OF WORCESTER PRIVY SEAL THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HIGH ADMIRAL AND ALL THE CONSIDERABLE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN
HE IMMEDIATELY MARCHED HIS FORCES AND ENTERED SCOTLAND WITH AN ARMY OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND MEN
AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM
AND HE ENDEAVORED TO ASSIST THAT CROWN IN ITS SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISES FOR REDUCING ALL ITS NEIGHBORS TO SUBJECTION AND RENDERING ITSELF ABSOLUTE MASTER OF THE BALTIC
136 176
BUT IF THIS WERE NOT HIS INTENTION THE METHOD IN WHICH HE DISTRIBUTED AND CONDUCTED THE ELECTIONS BEING SO FAVORABLE TO LIBERTY FORM AN INCONSISTENCY WHICH IS NOT EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR
AND THE ARMY FOR THE PRESENT SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THIS MARK OF SUBMISSION.[V PRETENDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT INTENDED TO LEVY WAR UPON THEM AND TO INVOLVE THE NATION AGAIN IN BLOOD AND CONFUSION THEY REQUIRED THAT ALL NEW LEVIES SHOULD BE STOPPED
AND THEY REQUIRED THE VOLUNTARY CONSENT OF ALL THE COUNTIES AND TOWNS OF THIS CONQUERED KINGDOM BEFORE THEY WOULD UNITE THEM INTO THE SAME COMMONWEALTH WITH ENGLAND
AND THAT YOUR MAJESTY WOULD BE ALSO GRACIOUSLY PLEASED FOR THE FURTHER COMFORT AND SAFETY OF YOUR PEOPLE TO DECLARE YOUR ROYAL WILL AND PLEASURE THAT IN THE THINGS AFORESAID ALL YOUR OFFICERS AND MINISTERS SHALL SERVE YOU ACCORDING TO THE LAWS AND STATUTES OF THIS REALM AS THEY TENDER THE HONOR OF YOUR MAJESTY AND THE PROSPERITY OF THIS KINGDOM
YET THE SAME SUM PRECISELY IS ASSIGNED IN ANOTHER BOOK CALLED ROYAL TREASURY OF ENGLAND P
WHAT RESOLUTIONS AND BEGINNINGS OF REFORMATION OF MANNERS WERE SENSIBLY PERCEIVED IN ALL PARTS OF THE NATION ABOVE ANY MEASURE THEY HAD EVER BEFORE FOUND OR COULD HAVE EXPECTED
HE ESTEEMS THE LAST ACTIONS OF MR HAMBDEN'S LIFE TO HARE BEEN VERY BLAMABLE
SIR GEORGE WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE STAR CHAMBER AND FINED TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
THE LOW CONDITION IN WHICH HE APPEARED AT NOTTINGHAM CONFIRMED ALL THESE HOPES
AND THE ADVANTAGES ACQUIRED HOWEVER REAL WOULD BE LESS STRIKING TO THE MULTITUDE WHOM IT WAS HIS INTEREST TO ALLURE
AND INFUSING BOLDNESS INTO THEIR COMPANIONS RESTORED TO THE PRESBYTERIAN PARTY THE ASCENDANT WHICH IT HAD FORMERLY LOST
ONE GUNNER ALONE PREFERRED DUTY TOWARDS HIS KING TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION
BUT AFTER THE UTMOST EFFORTS OF COURAGE BY BOTH PARTIES VICTORY WHOLLY TURNED TO THE SIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT
46 53 62
AND THE ENGLISH BY THAT MEANS POSSESSED THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ENGAGED BY POLITICAL MOTIVES INTO A MORE INTIMATE UNION AND CONFEDERACY WITH THE NEIGHBORING POTENTATE
AND THESE TWO SPLENDID COURTS APPEARED IN THEIR FULL LUSTRE AMIDST THOSE SAVAGE MOUNTAINS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SCHEME THEY WERE DECLARED ENEMIES TO ALL PROPOSALS OF PEACE EXCEPT ON SUCH TERMS AS THEY KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN
WE THERE CONTINUED DRINKING CANS OF BEER TILL ABOUT TEN OF THE CLOCK WHEN OUR SENTINEL AT THE GATE GAVE US NOTICE THAT THE MAN WITH THE SADDLE WAS COME
AND UPON HIS EARNEST PROTESTATIONS AND DECLARATIONS HE WAS SOON RESTORED TO HIS REGIMENT WHICH HE JOINED AT THE SIEGE OF NANTWICH
MOST HISTORIANS ARE INCLINED TO BLAME HIS CHOICE
TO ANOTHER THOU ART AN ADULTERER TO A THIRD THOU ART A DRUNKARD AND A GLUTTON AND THOU AN EXTORTIONER TO A FOURTH
CHARLES FINDING HIMSELF SUPPORTED BY A CONSIDERABLE PARTY IN THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A FIRMER TONE AND TO RETORT THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE COMMONS WITH A VIGOR WHICH HE HAD NOT BEFORE EXERTED
PERHAPS AND THIS IS THE MORE PROBABLE OPINION THE SUBTLETIES AND REFINEMENTS OF HIS CONDUCT AND HIS TEMPORIZING MAXIMS THOUGH ACCOMPANIED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS HAVE BEEN THE CHIEF CAUSE OF A SUSPICION WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN EITHER FULLY PROVED OR REFUTED
41,42,43
BUT THE PARLIAMENT SENSIBLE THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW CONDEMNED THEM AS REBELS AND TRAITORS DEEMED THIS POINT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THEIR FUTURE SECURITY
643
HIS POLITICS WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUCH VIGOR AND FORESIGHT AS MIGHT ENABLE HIM TO SUBDUE THEIR PRETENSIONS AND MAINTAIN HIS PREROGATIVE AT THE HIGH PITCH TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN RAISED BY HIS PREDECESSORS
AND AFTERWARDS FROM TIME TO TIME RENEWED THEIR GRANT FOR VERY SHORT PERIODS CHARLES IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT HE ENTERTAINED NO INTENTION EVER AGAIN TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIS PARLIAMENT PASSED THIS IMPORTANT BILL WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLE OR HESITATION IT WAS AN INSTRUCTION GIVEN BY THE HOUSE TO THE COMMITTEE WHICH FRAMED ONE OF THESE BILLS TO TAKE CARE THAT THE RATES UPON EXPORTATION MAY BE AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND UPON IMPORTATION AS HEAVY AS TRADE WILL BEAR
YET WILL HIS CONDUCT ADMIT OF EXCUSE
EVEN THE NEW TESTAMENT NAMES JAMES ANDREW JOHN PETER WERE NOT HELD IN SUCH REGARD AS THOSE WHICH WERE BORROWED FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT HEZEKIAH HABAKKUK JOSHUA ZEROBABEL
HE WAS SOON ROUTED AND TAKEN PRISONER
1383 1384
THE EAGER EXPECTATIONS OF MEN WITH REGARD TO A PARLIAMENT SUMMONED AT SO CRITICAL A JUNCTURE AND DURING SUCH GENERAL DISCONTENTS
ABOVE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MEMBERS MORE WERE EXCLUDED AND NONE WERE ALLOWED TO ENTER BUT THE MOST FURIOUS AND THE MOST DETERMINED OF THE INDEPENDENTS
THE ROMISH CHURCH IN ALL AGES HAD CAREFULLY MAINTAINED THAT FORM OF ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT
THE ADVANTAGES GAINED DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND THE GREAT DISTRESSES OF THE ROYALISTS HAD MUCH ELEVATED THEIR HOPES
CHARLES HAD HERE A DOUBLE ADVANTAGE
THOSE PULPITS WHICH HAD FORMERLY THUNDERED OUT THE MOST VIOLENT IMPRECATIONS AND ANATHEMAS AGAINST HIM
AND WHAT REMAINED THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LAND WAS EMPOWERED TO PURCHASE AT A LOW VALUATION THE KING LIKEWISE WARRANTED BY ANCIENT LAW AND PRACTICE HAD DECLARED FOR A GENERAL RESUMPTION OF ALL CROWN LANDS ALIENATED BY HIS PREDECESSORS
BUT THEY CONCEALED FROM HIM THAT THEY HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE WARRANT FOR THE EXECUTION
THE BARONS OF THE EXCHEQUER WERE QUESTIONED CONCERNING THEIR DECREES ON THAT HEAD ONE OF THE SHERIFFS OF LONDON WAS COMMITTED TO THE TOWER FOR HIS ACTIVITY IN SUPPORTING THE OFFICERS OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
THE SPIRITS OF MANY WERE BROKEN WITH TEDIOUS IMPRISONMENTS
ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
NOR IS IT SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT EXAMPLE AND PRECEDENT CAN NEVER AUTHORIZE VICES
AND THAT IN ORDER TO THIS SALUTARY PURPOSE HE WOULD PREVAIL EITHER FOR THE RESTORING OF THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAD BEEN SECLUDED BEFORE THE KING'S DEATH OR FOR THE ELECTION OF A NEW PARLIAMENT WHO MIGHT LEGALLY AND BY GENERAL CONSENT AGAIN GOVERN THE NATION
THE CLERGY INCULCATED OBEDIENCE AND LOYALTY AMONG THE PEOPLE
BUT THE COMMONS INSTEAD OF HEARKENING TO HIS SOLICITATIONS PROCEEDED TO CARRY THEIR SCRUTINY INTO HIS MANAGEMENT OF RELIGION WHICH WAS THE ONLY GRIEVANCE TO WHICH IN THEIR OPINION THEY HAD NOT AS YET BY THEIR PETITION OF RIGHT APPLIED A SUFFICIENT REMEDY
AND EXPECTED SHELTER AMIDST HER PRESENT DISTRESSES IN THE DOMINIONS OF HER DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW BUT THOUGH SHE BEHAVED IN THE MOST INOFFENSIVE MANNER SHE WAS INSULTED BY THE POPULACE ON ACCOUNT OF HER RELIGION AND WAS EVEN THREATENED WITH WORSE TREATMENT
9TH APRIL 1614
THE PARLIAMENT MADE ONE VIGOROUS EFFORT MORE TO TRY THE FORCE OF THEIR AUTHORITY
AND EXTREMELY READY WERE THEY ACCORDING TO THE HISTORIAN TO GIVE INSOLENT AND SEDITIOUS REPLIES TO ANY QUESTION
AND IF HE HAD INTENDED THAT GLAMORGAN'S NEGOTIATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT OF ORMOND HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD THE LATTER NOBLEMAN OF IT NOR HAVE PUT HIM ON HIS GUARD AGAINST GLAMORGAN'S IMPRUDENCE
HIS CREDIT WITH THE KING HAD GIVEN HIM SUCH INFLUENCE THAT HE HAD NO LESS THAN TWENTY PROXIES GRANTED HIM THIS PARLIAMENT BY SO MANY PEERS
THE GOVERNMENT OF CITIES WHICH EVEN UNDER ABSOLUTE MONARCHIES IS COMMONLY REPUBLICAN INCLINED THEM TO THIS PARTY
THE WORKS OF THE NOBLE HISTORIAN NOT BEING THEN PUBLISHED
THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THAT THE OLD PARLIAMENTARY PARTY THOUGH MANY OF THEM WERE DISPLEASED WITH CROMWELL WHO HAD DISPOSSESSED THEM OF THEIR POWER WERE STILL MORE APPREHENSIVE OF ANY SUCCESS TO THE ROYAL CAUSE
IF EVER ON ANY OCCASION IT WERE LAUDABLE TO CONCEAL TRUTH FROM THE POPULACE IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE DOCTRINE OF RESISTANCE AFFORDS SUCH AN EXAMPLE
MUCH LESS A NECESSITY WHICH IS MERELY FICTITIOUS AND PRETENDED
MONK RECEIVED ORDERS TO MARCH INTO THE CITY
HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT
AND OUGHT NOT WE AND YOU TO THINK WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING OF THE HAND OF THE GREAT GOD IN THIS MIGHTY AND STRANGE APPEARANCE OF HIS BUT CAN SLIGHTLY CALL IT AN EVENT
THAT TRAITOR CONTINUED WITH THE PARLIAMENT THE SAME CORRESPONDENCE WHICH HE HAD BEGUN WITH CROMWELL
P 435
AND THE PUBLIC WAS LESS ZEALOUS IN A CAUSE WHICH WAS BECOME ODIOUS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CALAMITIES WHICH HAD SO LONG ATTENDED IT
LORD CLARENDON SAYS IT WAS ENTIRELY NEW
THE YOUNG PALATINE WAS RESTORED TO PART OF HIS DIGNITIES AND OF HIS DOMINIONS THE RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND AUTHORITY OF THE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GERMANIC BODY WERE FIXED AND ASCERTAINED
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WHO SAT AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS GUIDED BY ARGYLE DREADED THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE MEASURES
TO COVER THESE HOSTILE INTENTIONS THE PARLIAMENT UNDER PRETENCE OF PROVIDING FOR THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE EMBRACED SUCH MEASURES AS THEY KNEW WOULD GIVE DISGUST TO THE STATES
CHARLES'S FLEET WAS FORMIDABLE AND WELL SUPPLIED
THE CIVIL ADMINISTRATION OF SCOTLAND WAS PLACED IN A COUNCIL CONSISTING MOSTLY OF ENGLISH OF WHICH LORD BROGHILE WAS PRESIDENT
AND VERY FEW MEMBERS WOULD SUBMIT TO THE MORTIFICATION OF ATTENDING IT
AND THAT WHILE PRINCE OF WALES HE HAD HIMSELF CONTRACTED DEBTS NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GREAT FRUGALITY TO THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE HAD EXPENDED ENTIRELY ON NAVAL AND MILITARY ARMAMENTS
THE PROFANE SCHOLARS AT OXFORD AFTER THE PARLIAMENT BECAME MASTERS OF THAT TOWN GAVE TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE ZEALOTS ASSEMBLED THE DENOMINATION OF SERNPLE SHOP
WITHOUT OSTENTATION EXPENSE OR CARESSES MERELY BY HIS HUMANE AND EQUAL TEMPER HE GAINED THE GOOD WILL OF THE SOLDIERY
AND THEY THENCE RECEDED THE APPELLATION OF QUAKERS AMIDST THE GREAT TOLERATION WHICH WAS THEN GRANTED TO ALL SECTS AND EVEN ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO ALL INNOVATIONS THIS SECT ALONE SUFFERED PERSECUTION
HIS PIETY THOUGH REMOTE FROM POPERY HAD A TINCTURE OF SUPERSTITION IN IT
NEWS WHICH EVERY DAY ARRIVED FROM ENGLAND OF THE FURY EXPRESSED BY THE COMMONS AGAINST ALL PAPISTS STRUCK FRESH TERROR INTO THE IRISH NATION AND BOTH STIMULATED THE CONSPIRATORS TO EXECUTE THEIR FATAL PURPOSE AND GAVE THEM ASSURED HOPES OF THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL THEIR COUNTRY MEN SUCH PROPENSITY TO A REVOLT WAS DISCOVERED IN ALL THE IRISH THAT IT WAS DEEMED UNNECESSARY AS IT WAS DANGEROUS TO INTRUST THE SECRET TO MANY HANDS
HIS PARTISANS AS WELL AS HIS ENEMIES WERE FOND OF REMARKING THIS EVENT
DISGUSTED WITH THIS TREATMENT HE HAD FORWARDED ALL THE VIOLENCE OF THE COVENANTERS
AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS
AND HAVING PASSED THESE VOTES FOR THE PRESENT COMPOSURE OF THE KINGDOM THEY DISSOLVED THEMSELVES AND ISSUED WRITS FOR THE IMMEDIATE ASSEMBLING OF A NEW PARLIAMENT
WHATEVER RIDICULE TO A PHILOSOPHICAL MIND MAY BE THROWN ON PIOUS CEREMONIES IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT DURING A VERY RELIGIOUS AGE NO INSTITUTIONS CAN BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE RUDE MULTITUDE AND TEND MORE TO MOLLIFY THAT FIERCE AND GLOOMY SPIRIT OF DEVOTION TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT
WALLER DREW UP ON ROUNDWAY DOWN ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THE DEVIZES AND ADVANCING WITH HIS CAVALRY TO FIGHT WILMOT AND PREVENT HIS CONJUNCTION WITH THE CORNISH INFANTRY WAS RECEIVED WITH EQUAL VALOR BY THE ROYALISTS
HE DREW TOGETHER THE SEVERAL SCATTERED REGIMENTS
AND THAT EVEN HIS ENEMIES THOUGH THEY LOADED HIM WITH MANY CALUMNIES DID NOT INSIST ON THIS ACCUSATION
HE GRANTED AN UNBOUNDED LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE TO ALL BUT CATHOLICS AND PRELATISTS
IN PROPORTION TO ITS DEGREE OF FANATICISM EACH SECT BECAME DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE
WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONTEMPT HE BROKE THE GATES AND PORTCULLISES
CONTRARY TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS THEY RECEIVED NO ACCESSION OF FORCE
THIS WICKED PERJURED TRAITOROUS AND PROFANE PERSON WHO REFUSES TO HEARKEN TO THE VOICE OF THY CHURCH SUCH WERE THE PETITIONS WHICH HE EXPECTED THEY WOULD ACCORDING TO CUSTOM OFFER UP FOR HIM
AND AMONG HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS OFTEN AFTER A DEEP SILENCE AND FREQUENT SIGHS HE WOULD WITH A SAD ACCENT REITERATE THE WORD PEACE
THE JUSTICES ORDERED TO DUBLIN ALL THE BODIES OF THE ARMY WHICH WERE NOT SURROUNDED BY THE REBELS
144
92 100
AND SO MANY NEW SUPERSTITIONS INTRODUCED BY THE HAUGHTY TYRANNICAL PRELATES AS BEGAT A JUST SUSPICION THAT A PROJECT WAS SERIOUSLY FORMED FOR THE RESTORATION OF POPERY
YET THIS PRINCE WHO HAD NOT THEN RAISED HIS POWER TO ITS GREATEST HEIGHT CONTINUED DURING THAT WHOLE TIME TO LEVY THE IMPOSITION
THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS IN AN UPROAR
PARSONS TEMPLE LOFTUS AND MEREDITH WHO FAVORED THE OPPOSITE PARTY HAD BEEN REMOVED
WITH GREAT ADVANTAGES ON THE SIDE OF THE COVENANTERS AND DISADVANTAGES ON THAT OF THE KING
HE DECLARED THAT HE SHOULD NEVER LOVE OR FAVOR THOSE WHO HAD SO LITTLE CONSCIENCE AS TO FOLLOW HIS INTERESTS IN PREFERENCE TO THE GOSPEL AND THE KINGDOM OF JESUS CHRIST
PLEASED THAT THE JEALOUSIES AND QUARRELS BETWEEN KING AND PARLIAMENT HAD DISARMED SO FORMIDABLE A POWER THEY CAREFULLY AVOIDED ANY ENTERPRISE WHICH MIGHT ROUSE EITHER THE TERROR OR ANGER OF THE ENGLISH AND DISPOSE THEM TO DOMESTIC UNION AND SUBMISSION
CHARLES FROM THE NATURAL PIETY OR SUPERSTITION OF HIS TEMPER WAS EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO THE ECCLESIASTICS
FAIRFAX OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING CROMWELL UNDER HIS NAME INTRODUCED AT LAST THE NEW MODEL INTO THE ARMY AND THREW THE TROOPS INTO A DIFFERENT SHAPE
ALARMS WERE EVERY DAY GIVEN OF NEW CONSPIRACIES IN LANCASHIRE GREAT MULTITUDES OF PAPISTS WERE ASSEMBLING
THOUGH IT IS ALLOWED THAT BEING SOMEWHAT OF A PASSIONATE TEMPER SHE PRECIPITATED HIM INTO HASTY AND IMPRUDENT MEASURES
NEVER ON ANY OCCASION DID THE POWER AND VIGOR OF THAT REPUBLIC APPEAR IN A MORE CONSPICUOUS LIGHT
IN REALITY THE CARDINAL HAD NOT ENTERTAINED SO HIGH AN IDEA OF CROMWELL
THIS COMPUTATION HOWEVER SEEMS MUCH TOO LARGE
AND THEY ENDEAVORED BY SOME MINUTE ALTERATIONS TO ELUDE THAT RULE OF PARLIAMENT WHICH OPPOSED THEM
AND WHEREAS OF LATE GREAT COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS AND MARINERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED INTO DIVERS COUNTIES OF THE REALM AND THE INHABITANTS AGAINST THEIR WILLS HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO RECEIVE THEM INTO THEIR HOUSES AND THERE TO SUFFER THEM TO SOJOURN AGAINST THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THIS REALM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEVANCE AND VEXATION OF THE PEOPLE
THE PASSING OF THE SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE HAD BEEN PROTRACTED BY SO MANY DEBATES AND INTRIGUES THAT THE SPRING WAS FAR ADVANCED BEFORE IT RECEIVED THE SANCTION OF BOTH HOUSES
THE PROTECTOR WAS TO ENJOY HIS OFFICE DURING LIFE
AFFAIRS LIKEWISE BY MEANS OF THE SCOTTISH INSURRECTION AND THE GENERAL DISCONTENTS IN ENGLAND WERE DRAWING SO NEAR TO A CRISIS THAT THE LEADERS OF THE HOUSE SAGACIOUS AND PENETRATING BEGAN TO FORESEE THE CONSEQUENCES AND TO HOPE THAT THE TIME SO LONG WISHED FOR WAS NOW COME WHEN ROYAL AUTHORITY MUST FALL INTO A TOTAL SUBORDINATION UNDER POPULAR ASSEMBLIES AND WHEN PUBLIC LIBERTY MUST ACQUIRE A FULL ASCENDANT
LET US NEVER THEREFORE DOUBT OF A FAVORABLE RECEPTION FROM HIS GOODNESS THESE SENTIMENTS WERE UNANIMOUSLY EMBRACED BY THE WHOLE HOUSE
AND PRETENDED THAT THEY MUST FIRST JUDGE WHETHER IT WERE PROPER TO GIVE UP THEIR MEMBERS TO A LEGAL TRIAL
AND WITH ALL HIS PENETRATION INTO THE CHARACTERS OF MEN HE COULD NOT FIND ANY MINISTERS ON WHOM HE COULD RELY
IN OTHER RENCOUNTERS HE OBTAINED SOME INCONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES
BECAUSE GERRARD WHO LAY IN WALES WITH THREE THOUSAND MEN MIGHT BE ENABLED IN A LITTLE TIME TO JOIN THE ARMY
AND A CONCURRENCE IN ANY ACT OF PARLIAMENT WHICH UPON MATURE DELIBERATION SHOULD BE OFFERED FOR INSURING THAT INDULGENCE
THE POISONING OF HIS FATHER THE BETRAYING OF ROCHELLE THE CONTRIVING OF THE IRISH MASSACRE BY BLASTING HIS FAME HAD THAT INJURY BEEN IN THEIR POWER THEY FORMED A VERY PROPER PRELUDE TO THE EXECUTING OF VIOLENCE ON HIS PERSON
HE OBTAINED A PASS FOR DURING THOSE TIMES OF CONFUSION THIS PRECAUTION WAS REQUISITE FOR HIS SISTER JANE LANE AND A SERVANT TO TRAVEL TOWARDS BRISTOL UNDER PRETENCE OF VISITING AND ATTENDING HER RELATION
NOR IS IT CREDIBLE THAT RELIGIOUS ZEAL COULD SO FAR HAVE BLINDED ALL OF THEM AS TO MAKE THEM DISCOVER IN SUCH A MEASURE ANY APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY OR ANY HOPES OF SUCCESS
BEING ACCUSED BY LORD RAE NOT WITHOUT SOME APPEARANCE OF PROBABILITY OF A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE KING CHARLES WAS SO FAR FROM HARBORING SUSPICION AGAINST HIM THAT THE VERY FIRST TIME HAMILTON CAME TO COURT HE RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS BED-CHAMBER AND PASSED ALONE THE NIGHT WITH HIM BUT SUCH WAS THE DUKE'S UNHAPPY FATE OR CONDUCT THAT HE ESCAPED NOT THE IMPUTATION OF TREACHERY TO HIS FRIEND AND SOVEREIGN
THE SOLDIERS WERE WARNED NOT TO THINK THE NATION SECURE FROM AN ENGLISH INVASION
A MEASURE WHICH CARRIED THE MOST PLAUSIBLE APPEARANCE BOTH FOR HIS SAFETY AND ADVANCEMENT
THE DESIRE OF REMAINING SOLE LORDS OF THE OCEAN ANIMATED THESE STATES TO AN HONORABLE EMULATION AGAINST EACH OTHER
THAT THIS MONARCH INTENDED TO ENTER GERMANY BY THE NORTH AND TO ROUSE TO ARMS THOSE PRINCES WHO IMPATIENTLY LONGED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASSERTING THE LIBERTY OF THE EMPIRE
THE VIOLENT PREJUDICES WHICH GENERALLY THROUGHOUT THE NATION PREVAILED AGAINST HIM
THE SCOTS AND THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS JEALOUS OF THE PROGRESS OF THE INDEPENDENTS WERE A NEW OBSTACLE WHICH WITHOUT THE UTMOST ART AND SUBTLETY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SURMOUNT CLARENDON VOL
THOUGH THEY DWELT ON MANY THINGS HE SAID ON WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE REFLECTED YET UPON REVOLVING THEM HE COULD NOT BUT CONFESS THAT TILL THERE WERE A PERFECT REFORMATION IN THESE PARTICULARS NOTHING WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK COULD POSSIBLY PROSPER
AND WITH IT EMBRACE THOSE PRINCIPLES OF SLAVERY WHICH IT INCULCATES WITH SUCH ZEAL ON ITS SUBMISSIVE PROSELYTES
NOR HEROES SET IN OPPOSITION TO COWARDS
AND THOUGH HE EXPRESSED HIS RESOLUTION FOR WHICH HE OFFERED THEM ANY SECURITY NEVER AGAIN TO EMPLOY STRAFFORD IN ANY BRANCH OF PUBLIC BUSINESS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TOTALLY DISSATISFIED WITH REGARD TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREASON AND ON THAT ACCOUNT DECLARED HIS DIFFICULTY IN GIVING HIS ASSENT TO THE BILL OF ATTAINDER THE COMMONS TOOK FIRE AND VOTED IT A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE FOR THE KING TO TAKE NOTICE OF ANY BILL DEPENDING BEFORE THE HOUSES CHARLES DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT HIS ATTACHMENT TO STRAFFORD WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE FOR THE BILL
THIS MAXIM IS NOT PECULIAR TO THE PEOPLE OF THAT AGE
THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF BOTH KINGDOMS RIVALLED EACH OTHER IN EXPRESSING ALL DUTY AND RESPECT TO THE KING AND IN SHOWING MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP AND REGARD TO EACH OTHER
SIR PHILIP WARWICK P
THE MEMBERS EXERTED THEIR SPIRIT CHIEFLY IN BITTER INVECTIVES AGAINST THE MEMORY OF CROMWELL AND IN EXECRATIONS AGAINST THE INHUMAN MURDER OF THEIR LATE SOVEREIGN
HISTORY THE GREAT MISTRESS OF WISDOM FURNISHES EXAMPLES OF ALL KINDS
101
BUT SO LITTLE INTEREST DID THE CROWN AT THAT TIME POSSESS IN THE NATION THAT GARDINER WAS DISAPPOINTED OF HIS ELECTION NOT ONLY IN LONDON BUT IN EVERY OTHER PLACE WHERE IT WAS ATTEMPTED
AS NO CHARGE EVER APPEARED OR WAS PROSECUTED AGAINST HIM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A MORE CHARITABLE INTERPRETATION TO THIS MEASURE THAN THAT THE COMMONS THEREBY INTENDED TO DEPRIVE STRAFFORD IN HIS PRESENT DISTRESS OF THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS BEST FRIEND WHO WAS MOST ENABLED BY HIS TESTIMONY TO JUSTIFY THE INNOCENCE OF HIS PATRON'S CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR CLARENDON VOL
THE VARIOUS TRANSGRESSIONS OF HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER TOGETHER WITH THE IDOLATRY OF HIS MOTHER ARE AGAIN ENUMERATED AND AGGRAVATED IN THESE ARTICLES
THE KING LIKEWISE ON HIS PART PUBLISHED A DECLARATION IN WHICH HE GAVE THE REASONS OF HIS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE PARLIAMENT AND OF THEIR SUDDEN DISSOLUTION BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO CONCLUDE ANY ONE ACT THESE PAPERS FURNISHED THE PARTISANS ON BOTH SIDES WITH AMPLE MATTER OF APOLOGY OR OF RECRIMINATION
61 BUT WHEN THE PARLIAMENT DEMANDED A BILL OF ATTAINDER AND BANISHMENT AGAINST SEVEN PERSONS THE MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE LORD DIGBY LORD BIRON SIR MARMADUKE LANGDALE SIR RICHARD GRANVILLE SIR FRANCIS DODDINGTON AND JUDGE JENKINS THE KING ABSOLUTELY REFUSED COMPLIANCE
THE LOUDEST ACCLAMATIONS WERE EXCITED BY THIS INTELLIGENCE
IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THEM TO A PASSIVE NEUTRALITY THE IRISH PRETENDED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE BRITISH NATIONS
THOUGH AN ENEMY TO RELIGION HE PARTAKES NOTHING OF THE SPIRIT OF SCEPTICISM
HIS ESTABLISHED CHARACTER FOR TRUTH AND SINCERITY HERE STOOD HIM IN GREAT STEAD
AND HAVING RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR CANNON LOST IN CORNWALL COULD NOT FORBEAR EMBRACING THEM WITH TEARS OF JOY
IN ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS AT THE PEACE OF RYSWIC THE FRENCH AMBASSADORS ALWAYS ADDRESSED KING WILLIAM AS KING OF ENGLAND
FOR IT WAS INTENDED BY CHOOSING THAT VERY PLACE IN SIGHT OF HIS OWN PALACE TO DISPLAY MORE EVIDENTLY THE TRIUMPH OF POPULAR JUSTICE OVER ROYAL MAJESTY
SHIP MONEY WAS DECLARED ILLEGAL AND ARBITRARY
748
748
748
THE MORE THE NATIONAL CONFUSIONS INCREASED THE MORE WAS HE CONFIDENT THAT ALL PARTIES WOULD AT LENGTH HAVE RECOURSE TO HIS LAWFUL AUTHORITY AS THE ONLY REMEDY FOR THE PUBLIC DISORDERS YOU CANNOT BE WITHOUT ME SAID HE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
A DEMAND WHICH BEFORE THEY HAD ONLY INSINUATED
SO GREAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF ZEAL AND UNANIMITY THAT THE SCOTTISH ARMY THOUGH SOMEWHAT SUPERIOR WERE SOONER READY THAN THE KING'S
AND THAT UPON A COMMITMENT BY THE KING AND COUNCIL BAIL OR RELEASEMENT HAD BEEN REFUSED TO JENNINGS PARGITER AND DANVERS WILLIAMS BISHOP OF LINCOLN A MAN OF SPIRIT AND LEARNING A POPULAR PRELATE AND WHO HAD BEEN LORD KEEPER WAS FINED TEN THOUSAND POUNDS BY THE STAR CHAMBER COMMITTED TO THE TOWER DURING THE KING'S PLEASURE AND SUSPENDED FROM HIS OFFICE
BUT LITTLE FRIENDSHIP HAD EVER SUBSISTED BETWEEN HIM AND THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS
AND THAT IF THE PULPITS HAD NOT OBEDIENCE WHICH WOULD NEVER BE IF PRESBYTERIAN GOVERNMENT WAS ABSOLUTELY ESTABLISHED THE KING WOULD HAVE BUT SMALL COMFORT OF THE MILITIA
AND LEAVE A NAME BEHIND HIM NOT TO BE EXTINGUISHED BUT WITH THE WHOLE WORLD
A COMMITTEE OF THE ENGLISH HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH HAD BEEN SENT OVER TO IRELAND IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE AFFAIRS OF THAT KINGDOM HAD BEEN EXCLUDED THE COUNCIL IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS TRANSMITTED FROM THE KING AND THESE WERE REASONS SUFFICIENT BESIDES THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH THEY THEMSELVES LABORED WHY THE PARLIAMENT WAS UNWILLING TO SEND SUPPLIES TO AN ARMY WHICH THOUGH ENGAGED IN A CAUSE MUCH FAVORED BY THEM WAS COMMANDED BY THEIR DECLARED ENEMIES
THE REST WERE DISTRIBUTED INTO THE HOUSES
BUT CHARLES WHO HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN THE EARL'S CAPACITY THOUGHT THAT HIS COUNSELS WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL DURING THE CRITICAL SESSION WHICH APPROACHED
THE EARL OF HOLLAND LIEUTENANT OF MIDDLESEX HAD ORDERED A HUNDRED MUSKETEERS TO GUARD HER
BISHOP JUXON A MAN ENDOWED WITH THE SAME MILD AND STEADY VIRTUES BY WHICH THE KING HIMSELF WAS SO MUCH DISTINGUISHED ASSISTED HIM IN HIS DEVOTIONS AND PAID THE LAST MELANCHOLY DUTIES TO HIS FRIEND AND SOVEREIGN
BUT AS SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES OCCURRED THE PROJECT WAS LAID ASIDE TWO MONTHS BEFORE ANY PUBLIC DISCOVERY WAS MADE OF IT
THE CRUELTIES COMMITTED ON THE ENGLISH AT AMBOYNA WHICH WERE CERTAINLY ENORMOUS BUT WHICH SEEMED TO BE BURIED IN OBLIVION BY A THIRTY YEARS SILENCE WERE AGAIN MADE THE GROUND OF COMPLAINT
ACTUATED EQUALLY BY THESE BIGOTED THESE AMBITIOUS AND THESE INTERESTED MOTIVES THE PROTECTOR EQUIPPED TWO CONSIDERABLE SQUADRONS
HIS MANNER WHICH WAS NOT IN ITSELF POPULAR NOR GRACIOUS NOW APPEARED AMIABLE FROM ITS GREAT MEEKNESS AND EQUALITY
AND IN FREEING GERMANY FROM THE YOKE OF FERDINAND HE INTENDED TO REDUCE IT TO SUBJECTION UNDER HIS OWN
FOR SOME TIME HOWEVER THE PUBLIC WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS OPINION
AND THIS UNEQUAL CONDUCT WAS OPENLY AVOWED AND JUSTIFIED
BUT THAT BY EXPERIENCE THE REMEDY HAD BEEN FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVEN DANGEROUS AND PERNICIOUS
AND FURTHER DECLARATIONS WERE INSISTED ON THAT HE SOUGHT THE RESTORATION OF HIS RIGHTS FOR THE SOLE ADVANCEMENT OF RELIGION AND IN SUBORDINATION TO THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST IN SHORT HAVING EXALTED THE ALTAR ABOVE THE THRONE AND BROUGHT ROYALTY UNDER THEIR FEET THE CLERGY WERE RESOLVED TO TRAMPLE ON IT AND VILIFY IT BY EVERY INSTANCE OF CONTUMELY WHICH THEIR PRESENT INFLUENCE ENABLED THEM TO IMPOSE UPON THEIR UNHAPPY PRINCE
THE PRESENT HOUSE OF COMMONS BEING ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF COUNTRY GENTLEMEN WHO CAME INTO PARLIAMENT WITH ALL THEIR NATIVE PREJUDICES ABOUT THEM AND WHOM THE CROWN HAD NO MEANS OF INFLUENCING COULD NOT FAIL TO CONTAIN A MAJORITY OF THESE STUBBORN PATRIOTS
VOLUME TWO
EVEN THE INTERNAL COMMERCE OF THE KINGDOM BEGAN TO STAGNATE
DESBOROW'S REGIMENT BEING SENT BY LAMBERT TO SUPPORT HIS FRIENDS NO SOONER ARRIVED AT ST ALBANS THAN IT DECLARED FOR THE SAME ASSEMBLY
THAT CROMWELL WAS EVER ABLE REALLY TO BLIND OR OVERREACH EITHER THE KING OR THE REPUBLICANS DOES NOT APPEAR
THE ONLY EXPEDIENT IT IS OBVIOUS WHICH THE SCOTS COULD EMBRACE IF THEY SCRUPLED WHOLLY TO ABANDON THE KING WAS IMMEDIATELY TO RETURN FULLY AND CORDIALLY TO THEIR ALLEGIANCE
OSBALDISTONE WAS LIKEWISE BROUGHT TO TRIAL AND CONDEMNED TO PAY A FINE OF FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS AND TO HAVE HIS EARS NAILED TO THE PILLORY BEFORE HIS OWN SCHOOL
KENNETS COMPLETE HIST
THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE POPULAR TORRENTS WHERE THE MOST INDIFFERENT OR EVEN THE MOST AVERSE ARE TRANSPORTED WITH THE GENERAL PASSION AND ZEALOUSLY ADOPT THE SENTIMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY TO WHICH THEY BELONG
NO ACTION HAD HAPPENED IN THAT PART OF ENGLAND EXCEPT ONE SKIRMISH WHICH OF ITSELF WAS OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE AND WAS RENDERED MEMORABLE BY THE DEATH ALONE OF THE FAMOUS HAMBDEN
1644 THE KING HAD HITHERTO DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR OBTAINED MANY ADVANTAGES OVER THE PARLIAMENT AND HAD RAISED HIMSELF FROM THAT LOW CONDITION INTO WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST FALLEN TO BE NEARLY UPON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIS ADVERSARIES
619
AND CLAIMING FRIENDSHIP AND CONSANGUINITY WITH THE SCOTS EXTENDED NOT OVER THEM THE FURY OF THEIR MASSACRES
THIS SEVERE SENTENCE WAS FOUNDED ON FRIVOLOUS PRETENCES AND WAS MORE ASCRIBED TO LAUD'S VENGEANCE THAN TO ANY GUILT OF THE BISHOP.[V LAUD HOWEVER HAD OWED HIS FIRST PROMOTION TO THE GOOD OFFICES OF THAT PRELATE WITH KING JAMES
ONE OF THE PRISONERS TAKEN IN THE ACTION SAID THAT HE WAS CONFIDENT MR HAMBDEN WAS HURT
IN THE ESSENTIAL HE WAS NOT DEFECTIVE
110
TREDAH NEURY AND OTHER FORTS WERE TAKEN
AND IF THE HOUSE MET AGAIN A VOTE HE WAS INFORMED WOULD CERTAINLY PASS TO BLAST HIS REVENUE OF SHIP MONEY
FOREIGNERS SCRUPLED TO GIVE ANY CREDIT TO A PEOPLE SO TORN BY DOMESTIC FACTION AND OPPRESSED BY MILITARY USURPATION
WHO DESERTED HIM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY HAD EMBARKED HIM IN THOSE WARLIKE MEASURES
EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WERE STIPULATED TO BE PAID BY THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY FOR LOSSES WHICH THE ENGLISH COMPANY HAD SUSTAINED
BUT THE CONSEQUENCE IN THE MEAN TIME OF THIS MEASURE WAS THE PUTTING OF ALL THE NORTHERN COUNTIES OUT OF THE PROTECTION OF ORDINARY LAW AND SUBJECTING THEM TO AN AUTHORITY SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY
BUT IT DISCOVERS IMAGINATION AND SENTIMENT AND PLEASES US AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE DISAPPROVE OF IT
A NEW INCIDENT WHICH HAPPENED IN IRELAND SERVED TO INFLAME THE MINDS OF MEN AND TO INCREASE THOSE CALUMNIES WITH WHICH HIS ENEMIES HAD SO MUCH LOADED HIM AND WHICH HE EVER REGARDED AS THE MOST GRIEVOUS PART OF HIS MISFORTUNES
HIS ABSENCE BEING REMARKED ORDERS WERE DESPATCHED FOR HIS IMMEDIATE ATTENDANCE IN PARLIAMENT
THE SITUATION IN WHICH HE STOOD AT HOME KEPT HIM IN PERPETUAL UNEASINESS AND INQUIETUDE
THOUGH HE STILL ENTERTAINED A GREAT JEALOUSY OF THAT AMBITIOUS AND RESTLESS SPIRIT BY WHICH THEY WERE ACTUATED
THE DECENCY HOWEVER WHICH THE POPULAR LEADERS HAD PRESCRIBED TO THEMSELVES AND RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS HINDERED THEM NOT FROM MAKING THE LOUDEST AND MOST VIGOROUS COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH THE NATION HAD LATELY LABORED
FAIRFAX HIMSELF WAS NO LESS SURPRISED AT THE KING'S ARRIVAL
THESE ARE HIS EXPRESSIONS
195
195
AND HE HAPPENED AT THAT VERY TIME TO BE PLAYING AT CHESS SUCH COMMAND OF TEMPER DID HE POSSESS THAT HE CONTINUED HIS GAME WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
SUPPRESS AGAIN THAT MONSTER IN ITS INFANCY AND OPENLY SET UP HIMSELF ABOVE ALL THINGS THAT EVER WERE CALLED SOVEREIGN IN ENGLAND
BUT THOUGH FOUR MONTHS WERE EMPLOYED BY THE MANAGERS IN FRAMING THE ACCUSATION AND ALL STRAFFORD'S ANSWERS WERE EXTEMPORARY IT APPEARS FROM COMPARISON NOT ONLY THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE CRIME OF TREASON OF WHICH THERE IS NOT THE LEAST APPEARANCE BUT THAT HIS CONDUCT MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR HUMAN INFIRMITIES EXPOSED TO SUCH SEVERE SCRUTINY WAS INNOCENT AND EVEN LAUDABLE
AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS OF WHOM THE COMMISSIONERS INQUIRED TOLD THEM THAT AFTER THEY WERE GONE AND EVEN HIS COUNCIL RETIRED SOME OF HIS BED-CHAMBER NEVER LEFT PRESSING AND PERSUADING HIM TILL THEY PREVAILED ON HIM TO CHANGE HIS FORMER RESOLUTIONS IT IS DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO CONCEIVE THAT ANY NEGOTIATION COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED BETWEEN THE KING AND PARLIAMENT WHILE THE LATTER INSISTED AS THEY DID ALL ALONG ON A TOTAL SUBMISSION TO ALL THEIR DEMANDS

SIR DUDLEY DIGGES WAS ABOUT THE SAME TIME CREATED MASTER OF THE ROLLS
WITHOUT FURTHER SCRUPLE THEREFORE OR JEALOUSY THE PEOPLE GAVE THEIR VOICE IN ELECTIONS FOR SUCH AS THEY KNEW TO ENTERTAIN SENTIMENTS FAVORABLE TO MONARCHY
DUGDALE
DUGDALE
AND HE HAD AUTHORITY TO NAME ANOTHER HOUSE WHO SHOULD ENJOY THEIR SEATS DURING LIFE AND EXERCISE SOME FUNCTIONS OF THE FORMER HOUSE OF PEERS
AND THOUGH NO ENTHUSIAST HIMSELF HE WELL KNEW HOW TO EMPLOY TO ADVANTAGE THAT ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT SO PREVALENT IN HIS CITY AND GARRISON
BY DISPOSING BEFOREHAND OF ALL THE IRISH FORFEITURES TO SUBSCRIBERS OR ADVENTURERS THEY RENDERED ALL MEN OF PROPERTY DESPERATE AND SEEMED TO THREATEN A TOTAL EXTIRPATION OF THE NATIVES AND WHILE THEY THUS INFUSED ZEAL AND ANIMOSITY INTO THE ENEMY NO MEASURE WAS PURSUED WHICH COULD TEND TO SUPPORT OR ENCOURAGE THE PROTESTANTS NOW REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITIES

FAIRFAX SECONDED BY SKIPPON PLACED HIMSELF IN THE MAIN BODY OF THE OPPOSITE ARMY
HERE TAKE IT AWAY
ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE
AND THEY AFFIRMED THAT THE CAUSE OF THEIR TAKING ARMS WAS TO VINDICATE ROYAL PREROGATIVE NOW INVADED BY THE PURITANICAL PARLIAMENT.[V SIR PHELIM O'NEALE HAVING FOUND A ROYAL PATENT IN LORD CAULFIELD'S HOUSE WHOM HE HAD MURDERED TORE OFF THE SEAL AND AFFIXED IT TO A COMMISSION WHICH HE HAD FORGED FOR HIMSELF.[V NALSON VOL
THE KING'S DEATH THE EXECUTION OF SO MANY OF THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY THE SEQUESTRATION AND IMPRISONMENT OF THE REST WERE IN THEIR EYES CRIMES SO DEEP AND OFFENCES SO PERSONAL AS MUST BE PROSECUTED WITH THE MOST IMPLACABLE RESENTMENT
AND THEY APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO PREPARE THE MODEL OF SO IMPORTANT A LAW
THE SCHEME LAID FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF POPERY AND SUPERSTITION INVEIGHED AGAINST
AND WAS RESOLVED THAT WHAT DEPREDATIONS SOEVER FORTUNE SHOULD COMMIT UPON HIM SHE NEVER SHOULD BEREAVE HIM OF HIS HONOR COLONEL COOKE'S MEMOIRS P
BESIDES RESOLVING TO AMEND AND REFORM THEIR LIVES THE COVENANTERS THEIR VOW THAT THEY WILL NEVER LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS SO LONG AS THE PAPISTS NOW IN OPEN WAR AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT SHALL BY FORCE OF ARMS BE PROTECTED FROM JUSTICE
TO SEARCH ANY TRUNK OR CHEST
STAND AND HOLD FAST FROM HENCEFORTH THE PLACE TO WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN HEIR BY THE SUCCESSION OF YOUR FOREFATHERS BEING NOW DELIVERED TO YOU BY THE AUTHORITY OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND BY THE HANDS OF US AND ALL THE BISHOPS AND SERVANTS OF GOD
BUT CARE WAS TAKEN TO INFORM THE PEOPLE THAT THE SUMS EXACTED WERE NOT TO BE CALLED SUBSIDIES BUT LOANS HAD ANY DOUBT REMAINED WHETHER FORCED LOANS HOWEVER AUTHORIZED BY PRECEDENT AND EVEN BY STATUTE WERE A VIOLATION OF LIBERTY AND MUST BY NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE RENDER ALL PARLIAMENTS SUPERFLUOUS THIS WAS THE PROPER EXPEDIENT FOR OPENING THE EYES OF THE WHOLE NATION
MANY SCOTCH OFFICERS HAD ACQUIRED REPUTATION IN THE GERMAN WARS PARTICULARLY UNDER GUSTAVUS
THOUGH NOTHING SURELY COULD BE MORE DISAGREEABLE TO A PRINCE FULL OF DIGNITY THAN TO BE A BURDEN ON HIS FRIENDS INSTEAD OF BEING A SUPPORT TO THEM
MANY SPEECHES WERE MADE TO THE CITIZENS BY THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS IN ORDER TO EXCITE THEIR ARDOR
THAT ALL THE OFFICERS OF STATE AND PRINCIPAL JUDGES SHOULD BE CHOSEN WITH CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT AND ENJOY THEIR OFFICES FOR LIFE
AND HE THENCE INFERRED THAT THE ASSEMBLY AT WESTMINSTER WAS NO LONGER A FREE PARLIAMENT AND TILL ITS LIBERTY WERE RESTORED WAS ENTITLED TO NO AUTHORITY
THE KING'S POWER IS INDEED MORE EXACTLY LIMITED
SHOULD BY THE SAME PEOPLE AT NO GREATER DISTANCE THAN A CENTURY HAVE BEEN LED TO A PUBLIC AND IGNOMINIOUS EXECUTION AND HIS NAME BE EVER AFTER PURSUED BY FALSEHOOD AND BY OBLOQUY
THE EARL OF LEICESTER WHOM THE KING HAD APPOINTED LIEUTENANT REMAINED IN LONDON THE TWO JUSTICES SIR WILLIAM PARSONS AND SIR JOHN BORLACE WERE MEN OF SMALL ABILITIES
YET IT WAS LONG BEFORE HE WOULD OPEN HIMSELF EVEN TO THE KING
WE MUST INQUIRE ADDED HE FROM WHAT FOUNTAIN THESE WATERS OF BITTERNESS FLOW
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ARMY WAS AT THIS TIME TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND MEN
EVEN IN THE PARADISE LOST HIS CAPITAL PERFORMANCE THERE ARE VERY LONG PASSAGES AMOUNTING TO NEAR A THIRD OF THE WORK ALMOST WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF HARMONY AND ELEGANCE NAY OF ALL VIGOR OF IMAGINATION
THE COMMONS FOR THIS REASON OPENLY PROFESSED THEIR INTENTION OF RETAINING THESE INVADERS TILL ALL THEIR OWN ENEMIES SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED AND ALL THEIR PURPOSES EFFECTED
DOES IT NOT APPEAR BY THE WHOLE TRAIN OF EVENTS THAT THE PARLIAMENT FORCED HIM INTO THE WAR
AND THAT THE BEST POLICY WAS TO OBLIGE HIM TO TAKE OFF THE MASK AT ONCE
BUT IF THE FIRST ATTEMPT OR PROVOCATION CAME FROM THEM HE WOULD RETALIATE TO THE UTTERMOST
HAD HE BEEN BORN AN ABSOLUTE PRINCE HIS HUMANITY AND GOOD SENSE HAD RENDERED HIS REIGN HAPPY AND HIS MEMORY PRECIOUS
AND OPENLY INVEIGHED IN VIOLENT TERMS AGAINST THE PERSON AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KING
ABOUT SIX THOUSAND MEN ARMED WITH SWORDS AND CUDGELS FLOCKED FROM THE CITY AND SURROUNDED THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT THE NAMES OF THE FIFTY-NINE COMMONERS WHO HAD VOTED AGAINST THE BILL OF ATTAINDER WERE POSTED UP UNDER THE TITLE OF STRAFFORDIANS AND BETRAYERS OF THEIR COUNTRY THESE WERE EXPOSED TO ALL THE INSULTS OF THE UNGOVERNABLE MULTITUDE
THE QUAKERS HOWEVER ARE SO CONSIDERABLE AT LEAST SO SINGULAR AS TO MERIT SOME ATTENTION
THEY MENTIONED THE DECAY OF TRADE THE UNSUCCESSFUL EXPEDITIONS TO CADIZ AND THE ISLE OF RHE THE ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN TO ARMINIANS THE COMMISSION FOR TRANSPORTING GERMAN HORSE THAT FOR LEVYING ILLEGAL IMPOSITIONS
FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER
THE KING HIMSELF JOINED THE ARMY AND HE SUMMONED ALL THE PEERS OF ENGLAND TO ATTEND HIM
AND THE REPUBLICANS WHO REPOSED GREAT CONFIDENCE IN HIM WERE INCONSOLABLE
WITHOUT A REGULAR AND FIXED FOUNDATION THE THRONE PERPETUALLY TOTTERED
THEY CONSIDERED BESIDES THAT AS THE PROPERTY OF THE KINGDOM LAY MOSTLY IN THE HANDS OF GREAT FAMILIES IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH A COMMON WEALTH
181
AND WITHOUT ANY MORE CEREMONY BY THE ADVICE OF HIS COUNCIL OF OFFICERS HE SENT SUMMONS TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT PERSONS OF DIFFERENT TOWNS AND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND TO FIVE OF SCOTLAND TO SIX OF IRELAND
451
BUT HIS ARMY WAS NEW LEVIED ILL PAID AND WORSE DISCIPLINED
AND THAT CHARACTER WHICH IN THAT RELIGIOUS AGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF INFINITE ADVANTAGE TO HIM PROVED IN THE END THE CHIEF CAUSE OF HIS RUIN
TO INCITE SUCH AN ARMY TO REBELLION AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT REQUIRED NO UNCOMMON ART OR INDUSTRY
OR THAT THIS IS THE WAY TO DISTRACTION
DUBLIN WAS THREATENED WITH A SIEGE
WHEREVER THEY WERE QUARTERED THEY EXCLUDED THE MINISTER FROM HIS PULPIT
ESSEX DISCOURAGED BY THIS EVENT DISMAYED BY THE TOTAL ROUT OF WALLER WAS FURTHER INFORMED THAT THE QUEEN WHO LANDED AT BURLINGTON BAY HAD ARRIVED AT OXFORD AND HAD BROUGHT FROM THE NORTH A REENFORCEMENT OF THREE THOUSAND FOOT AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED HORSE
ACCORDINGLY THE KING GAVE ORDERS TO ORMOND AND THE JUSTICES TO CONCLUDE FOR A YEAR A CESSATION OF ARMS WITH THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY BY WHOM THE IRISH WERE GOVERNED AND TO LEAVE BOTH SIDES IN POSSESSION OF THEIR PRESENT ADVANTAGES
THESE WERE LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF
THIS DECLARATION WAS WITHIN EIGHT DAYS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON
CHARLES CHOSE HIS POST AT NEWBURY WHERE THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMIES UNDER THE EARL OF MANCHESTER ATTACKED HIM WITH GREAT VIGOR
HARRISON HAVING ASSURED THE COUNCIL THAT THE GENERAL SOUGHT ONLY TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF JESUS AND HIS SAINTS MAJOR STREATER BRISKLY REPLIED THAT JESUS OUGHT THEN TO COME QUICKLY
BUT AS AN ADMONITION FROM HIM WHO BY NATURE AND DUTY HAS MOST CARE OF YOUR PRESERVATION AND PROSPERITY THE LORD KEEPER BY THE KING'S DIRECTION SUBJOINED THIS WAY OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPLIES AS HIS MAJESTY TOLD YOU HE HATH CHOSEN NOT AS THE ONLY WAY BUT AS THE FITTEST
AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS HE TOLD ONE OF THE SHERIFFS WHO OF THE TWO WAS THOUGHT THE LEAST INCLINED TO HIS SERVICE THAT HE WOULD DINE WITH HIM
HIS ADDRESS AND MANNER THOUGH PERHAPS INCLINING A LITTLE TOWARDS STATELINESS AND FORMALITY IN THE MAIN CORRESPONDED TO HIS HIGH RANK AND GAVE GRACE TO THAT RESERVE AND GRAVITY WHICH WERE NATURAL TO HIM
MOST OF THEM WERE HIS CREATURES HAD OWED THEIR ADVANCEMENT TO HIS FAVOR AND RELIED ENTIRELY UPON HIM FOR THEIR FUTURE PREFERMENT
400 AND IN MILTON'S WORKS TOLAND'S EDITION IS PLAINLY AN IMPOSTURE
P.300 IN THIS NEGOTIATION THE MAN CHIEFLY TRUSTED WAS VANE WHO IN ELOQUENCE ADDRESS CAPACITY AS WELL AS IN ART AND DISSIMULATION WAS NOT SURPASSED BY ANY ONE EVEN DURING THAT AGE SO FAMOUS FOR ACTIVE TALENTS
SUCH PRETENSIONS AS THE COMMONS ADVANCED AT PRESENT WOULD IN ANY FORMER AGE HAVE BEEN DEEMED STRANGE USURPATIONS

1-671-GLOUCESTER.JPG GLOUCESTER BUT THE MOST MEMORABLE ACTIONS OF VALOR DURING THIS WINTER SEASON WERE PERFORMED IN THE WEST
AND MUST BE REGARDED AS ONE EFFECT THOUGH OF THE MOST INNOCENT AND EVEN HONORABLE KIND OF THAT SPIRIT PARTLY FANATICAL PARTLY REPUBLICAN WHICH PREDOMINATED IN ENGLAND
BY STRONGER CONTAGION THE POPULAR AFFECTIONS WERE COMMUNICATED FROM BREAST TO BREAST IN THIS PLACE OF GENERAL RENDEZVOUS AND SOCIETY
BUT BY THE PROGRESS OF THE KING'S ARMS THE DEFEAT OF SIR WILLIAM WALLER THE TAKING OF BRISTOL THE SIEGE OF GLOUCESTER A CRY FOR PEACE WAS RENEWED AND WITH MORE VIOLENCE THAN EVER
AND A UNIVERSAL EQUALITY OF PROPERTY AS WELL AS OF POWER BE INTRODUCED AMONG THE CITIZENS
BUT THE PARLIAMENT WAS DEALING WITH MEN WHO WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED BY WORDS NOR RETARDED BY ANY SCRUPULOUS DELICACY
AMIDST THESE DANGEROUS COMPLAINTS AND TERRORS OF RELIGIOUS INNOVATION THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL LIBERTIES OF THE NATION WERE IMAGINED AND WITH SOME REASON NOT TO BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM INVASION
THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
AND AT PEZENAS IN LANGUEDOC HE WAS INTRODUCED UNDER A BORROWED NAME TO THE PRINCE OF CONTI
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME STEPS WHICH WOULD HAVE BETRAYED IT
BUT HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE HAD OBSERVED AS GREAT A WEAKNESS AND FOLLY AS THAT IN THAT AFTER THEY THE SPANIARDS HAD USED HIM SO ILL THEY WOULD SUFFER HIM TO DEPART WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SPEECHES HE UTTERED AFTER HE CAME INTO THE SHIP
THE CANDIDATES WERE NO MORE PERPLEXED WITH QUESTIONS CONCERNING THEIR PROGRESS IN GREEK AND ROMAN ERUDITION
DURING THIS IMPORTANT TRANSACTION OF THE SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE WERE LIKEWISE CARRIED ON THOUGH WITH SMALL HOPES OF SUCCESS
THE JEALOUSY OF LIBERTY ROUSED
AND THAT ALL SPECULATIVE REASONERS OUGHT TO OBSERVE WITH REGARD TO THIS PRINCIPLE THE SAME CAUTIOUS SILENCE WHICH THE LAWS IN EVERY SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT HAVE EVER PRESCRIBED TO THEMSELVES
AND MANY BELIEVED THAT HE NEVER WOULD ATTEMPT RESISTANCE BUT MUST SOON YIELD TO THE PRETENSIONS HOWEVER ENORMOUS OF THE TWO HOUSES
BUT THE CRIME COMMITTED BY THE PORTUGUESE GENTLEMAN WAS TO THE LAST DEGREE ATROCIOUS
HE FELL UNEXPECTEDLY ON MONTROSE WHO HAD NO HORSE TO BRING HIM INTELLIGENCE
AFTER A RESISTANCE OF FOUR HOURS THE SPANIARDS YIELDED TO ENGLISH VALOR AND ABANDONED THEIR SHIPS WHICH WERE SET ON FIRE AND CONSUMED WITH ALL THEIR TREASURE
SIR FERDINANDO GORGES WHO COMMANDED ONE OF THE VESSELS BROKE THROUGH AND RETURNED TO ENGLAND
EVEN THE PREROGATIVE WHICH EMPOWERED THE CROWN TO ISSUE SUCH WRITS IS ABOLISHED AND ITS EXERCISE ALMOST ENTIRELY DISCONTINUED FROM THE TIME OF EDWARD III AND ALL THE AUTHORITY WHICH REMAINED OR WAS AFTERWARDS EXERCISED WAS TO PRESS SHIPS INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE PUBLIC
AND THE KING HERE FOUND MARKS OF ATTACHMENT BEYOND WHAT HE HAD BEFORE EXPECTED WARWICK P

103 619 653
THE SCHEME OF FOREIGN POLITICS ADOPTED BY THE PROTECTOR WAS HIGHLY IMPRUDENT BUT WAS SUITABLE TO THAT MAGNANIMITY AND ENTERPRISE WITH WHICH HE WAS SO SIGNALLY ENDOWED
THIS WAS THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS AND SOLEMNLY SWORN TO BY OLIVER CROMWELL
THOUGH INNOCENT TOWARDS HIS PEOPLE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE EQUITY OF HIS EXECUTION IN THE EYES OF HIS MAKER
ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I HAVE NOT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
A FRIEND TO JUSTICE THOUGH HIS PUBLIC CONDUCT WAS ONE CONTINUED VIOLATION OF IT
LENTHAL THE SPEAKER BEING INVITED BY THE OFFICERS AGAIN ASSUMED AUTHORITY AND SUMMONED TOGETHER THE PARLIAMENT WHICH TWICE BEFORE HAD BEEN EXPELLED WITH SO MUCH REPROACH AND IGNOMINY
THIS ENCOURAGEMENT I HAVE THOUGHT NOT UNFIT FOR YOU TO RECEIVE
IT APPEARS INDEED TO BE THE ONLY REASON WHY ORMOND OBJECTED TO THE GRANTING OF HIGH TERMS TO THE IRISH CATHOLICS
WITHOUT SCRUPLE HE CARRIED ON WAR AGAINST THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THREATENED WITH A SIEGE THE PROTESTANT GARRISONS WHICH WERE ALL OF THEM VERY ILL PROVIDED FOR DEFENCE
HE DISDAINED BY SUBMISSION OR COMPOSITION TO SHOW OBEISANCE TO THEIR USURPED AUTHORITY
THE SAME AUTHOR ADDS THAT THE KING'S INTENTION WAS TO TEACH HIS SUBJECTS HOW UNTHRIFTY A THING IT WAS TO REFUSE REASONABLE SUPPLIES TO THE CROWN
THE ARCHBISHOPS OF CANTERBURY IN THIS REIGN WERE ABBOT AND LAUD
THAT EVENT SOON FOLLOWED UPON THE DEATH OF THE MONARCH
HIS NAME WAS BRET AND HIS CHIEF BUSINESS WAS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE POPE CONCERNING INDULGENCES TO THE CATHOLICS AND TO ENGAGE THE CATHOLICS IN RETURN TO BE GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS
AND WHO PRETENDED THAT THE SAINTS IN THE MEAN WHILE THAT IS THEMSELVES WERE ALONE ENTITLED TO GOVERN

ALL HOPES OF PILLAGE THE BEST INCENTIVE TO VALOR AMONG SUCH MEN WERE REFUSED THE SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN

IN ANOTHER QUARTER SIEGE BEING LAID TO NEWARK BY THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES PRINCE RUPERT PREPARED HIMSELF FOR RELIEVING A TOWN OF SUCH CONSEQUENCE WHICH ALONE PRESERVED THE COMMUNICATION OPEN BETWEEN THE KING'S SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN QUARTERS WITH A SMALL FORCE BUT THAT ANIMATED BY HIS ACTIVE COURAGE HE BROKE THROUGH THE ENEMY RELIEVED THE TOWN AND TOTALLY DISSIPATED THAT ARMY OF THE PARLIAMENT
IN THIS SITUATION IT WAS THOUGHT MORE PRUDENT TO SUBMIT AND BY COMPLIANCE TO STOP THE FURY OF THE ENRAGED ARMY
THESE PETITIONS BECAME SECRET BONDS OF ASSOCIATION AMONG THE SUBSCRIBERS AND SEEMED TO GIVE UNDOUBTED SANCTION AND AUTHORITY TO THE COMPLAINTS WHICH THEY CONTAINED
THE CAUTIOUS MAZARINE PLEADING THE ALLIANCE OF FRANCE WITH THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH REFUSED EVEN TO SEE HIM
AS STORIES OF PLOTS HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED
ON THE CONTRARY THE LAITY APPREHENDING FROM SEVERAL INSTANCES WHICH OCCURRED A SPIRIT OF MODERATION IN THAT ORDER RESOLVED TO DOMINEER ENTIRELY IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS SUMMONED AND TO HURRY ON THE ECCLESIASTICS BY THE SAME FURIOUS ZEAL WITH WHICH THEY WERE THEMSELVES TRANSPORTED KING'S DECL

RICHARD A YOUNG MAN OF NO EXPERIENCE EDUCATED IN THE COUNTRY ACCUSTOMED TO A RETIRED LIFE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE OFFICERS AND UNKNOWN TO THEM RECOMMENDED BY NO MILITARY EXPLOITS ENDEARED BY NO FAMILIARITIES COULD NOT LONG IT WAS THOUGHT MAINTAIN THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HIS FATHER HAD ACQUIRED BY SO MANY VALOROUS ACHIEVEMENTS AND SUCH SIGNAL SUCCESSES
PENNINGTON DECLARED THAT HE WOULD RATHER BE HANGED IN ENGLAND FOR DISOBEDIENCE THAN FIGHT AGAINST HIS BROTHER PROTESTANTS IN FRANCE
THEN HE RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT AND GAVE IT TO OTHERS
THAT RAPID PROGRESS OF CONQUEST WHICH WE SO MUCH ADMIRE IN ANCIENT HISTORY WAS HERE RENEWED IN MODERN ANNALS
THE KING FOLLOWED HIM AND HAVING REENFORCED HIS ARMY FROM ALL QUARTERS APPEARED IN THE FIELD WITH AN ARMY SUPERIOR TO THE ENEMY
SOME YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF LINCOLN'S INN HEATED BY THEIR CUPS HAVING DRUNK CONFUSION TO THE ARCHBISHOP WERE AT HIS INSTIGATION CITED BEFORE THE STAR CHAMBER

AND THAT THE WHOLE COMMUNITY OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THEIR DETERMINATION
DISUSE OF PARLIAMENTS IMPRISONMENTS AND PROSECUTION OF MEMBERS SHIP MONEY AN ARBITRARY ADMINISTRATION
THIS NARROWNESS OF MIND IF WE WOULD BE IMPARTIAL WE MUST EITHER BLAME OR EXCUSE EQUALLY ON BOTH SIDES

THOUGH THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT WAS BUT THE MERE SHADOW OF A COMMONWEALTH YET WAS IT BEGINNING BY PROPER ARTS TO ENCOURAGE THAT PUBLIC SPIRIT WHICH NO OTHER SPECIES OF CIVIL POLITY IS EVER ABLE FULLY TO INSPIRE

WELL SINCE I SEE ALL THE BIRDS ARE FLOWN I DO EXPECT THAT YOU WILL SEND THEM TO ME AS SOON AS THEY RETURN
AND BY THE LOSS ALREADY SUSTAINED AS WELL AS BY THE PROSPECT OF FURTHER DANGER EVERY ONE WAS EXTREMELY DISCOURAGED
OF HAVING BOUGHT TWO OF THEM
UPON THIS NOTABLE INTELLIGENCE ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR SEIZING PRIESTS AND JESUITS A CONFERENCE WAS DESIRED WITH THE LORDS AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS

AND MANY SERMONS AND LECTURES WERE MADE HIM EXHORTING HIM TO PERSEVERE IN THAT HOLY CONFEDERACY HAMILTON LAUDERDALE DUMFERMLING AND OTHER NOBLEMEN OF THAT PARTY WHOM THEY CALLED ENGAGERS WERE IMMEDIATELY SEPARATED FROM HIM AND OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO THEIR HOUSES WHERE THEY LIVED IN A PRIVATE MANNER WITHOUT TRUST OR AUTHORITY
THE SMALL HEREDITARY INFLUENCE WHICH CAN BE RETAINED OVER THE INDUSTRIOUS INHABITANTS OF TOWNS THE NATURAL INDEPENDENCE OF CITIZENS AND THE FORCE OF POPULAR CURRENTS OVER THOSE MORE NUMEROUS ASSOCIATIONS OF MANKIND

THE PEOPLE WHILE THEY LOST THEIR LIBERTIES ACQUIRED BY MEANS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION LEARNING ORDER DISCIPLINE AND RENOWN
ON HIS ARRIVAL HE RECEIVED THE NEWS OF BOOTH'S DEFEAT AND THE TOTAL FAILURE OF THE ENTERPRISE
THE METHODS BY WHICH THIS INTRIGUE WAS CONDUCTED ARE SO SINGULAR AND SHOW SO FULLY THE GENIUS OF THE AGE THAT WE SHALL GIVE A DETAIL OF THEM AS THEY ARE DELIVERED BY LORD CLARENDON A FAST ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY OF EVERY MONTH HAD BEEN ORDERED BY THE PARLIAMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THESE COMMOTIONS
AN INSURRECTION WAS RAISED IN KENT BY YOUNG HALES AND THE EARL OF NORWICH
COMPANIES OF INFANTRY AND CAVALRY WERE ENLISTED UNDER PROPER OFFICERS REGULAR PAY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM AND A RESOURCE BY THAT MEANS PROVIDED BOTH AGAINST THE INSURRECTIONS OF THE ROYALISTS AND MUTINY OF THE ARMY
HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO ENTER INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH SPAIN AND CROMWELL WHO KNEW THE DISTEMPERS OF THE ARMY WAS JUSTLY AFRAID OF SOME MUTINY TO WHICH A DAY AN HOUR AN INSTANT MIGHT PROVIDE LEADERS
THE LEVELLERS INSISTED ON AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER AND PROPERTY AND DISCLAIMED ALL DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION

TOGETHER WITH APPREHENSIONS LEST SUCH TYRANNICAL RULERS SHOULD EXERT THEIR POWER BY TAKING VENGEANCE UPON THEIR ENEMIES WHO HAD SO OPENLY INSULTED THEM

AND CROMWELL HAD SO FAR ADVANCED WITH HIS DECAYED ARMY THAT HE BEGAN TO FIND IT DIFFICULT EITHER TO SUBSIST IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY OR RETREAT TO HIS OWN GARRISONS
IN ORDER TO EXTORT LOANS OR RATHER SUBSIDIES WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
HOW EARLY HE ENTERTAINED THOUGHTS OF TAKING INTO HIS HAND THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT IS UNCERTAIN
EQUALLY INDULGENT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND RIGOROUS TO THEIR ENEMIES THEY EMPLOYED WITH SUCCESS THESE TWO POWERFUL ENGINES OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN CONFIRMATION OF THEIR AUTHORITY
WHEN THE SPEAKER CAME IN HIS COACH HE ORDERED THE HORSES TO BE TURNED AND VERY CIVILLY CONDUCTED HIM HOME
THAT THE ENGLISH PLANTERS WHO HAD EXPELLED THEM THEIR POSSESSIONS SUPPRESSED THEIR RELIGION AND BEREAVED THEM OF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE BUT A HANDFUL IN COMPARISON OF THE NATIVES
THE COUNCIL ITSELF WAS BESIEGED AND VIOLENTLY ATTACKED
IN WHICH THE FORMER WAS TOTALLY DEFEATED
THE SEVERITIES TOO EXERCISED AGAINST THE EPISCOPAL CLERGY NATURALLY AFFECTED THE ROYALISTS AND EVEN ALL MEN OF CANDOR IN A SENSIBLE MANNER
WHAT THOUGH PUBLIC PEACE AND NATIONAL INDUSTRY INCREASED THE COMMERCE AND OPULENCE OF THE KINGDOM
THE PARLIAMENT INTENDED BY THIS VIGOR IN THEIR RESOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE VIGOR OF THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS
WHO WAS THE AGGRESSOR IN THE ACTION WHICH ENSUED BETWEEN THESE TWO ADMIRALS BOTH OF THEM MEN OF SUCH PROMPT AND FIERY DISPOSITIONS IT IS NOT EASY TO DETERMINE
TOMKINS WALLER'S BROTHER-IN-LAW AND CHALONER THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF TOMKINS HAD ENTERTAINED LIKE SENTIMENTS
330
THE SOVEREIGN IS THE GREAT EXECUTOR OF THE LAWS
WE ARE SEEKING THE LORD SAID THEY
AND THE REST WERE NOW ANNULLED BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT AND EVERY ONE WHO WAS CONCERNED IN THEM DECLARED DELINQUENTS
THE KING'S TROOPS FULL OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY HAD EXERTED A VALOR SUPERIOR TO THEIR ENEMIES AND HAD HITHERTO BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ALMOST EVERY RENCOUNTER
THE INSURRECTION WHICH HAD BEEN ADVANCING BY A GRADUAL AND SLOW PROGRESS NOW BLAZED UP AT ONCE
DURING THE PROGRESS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS THERE HAVE ARISEN IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMIES MANY EXCELLENT OFFICERS WHO ARE QUALIFIED FOR HIGHER COMMANDS THAN THEY ARE NOW POSSESSED OF
BUT THE EXECUTION OF IT WAS SUSPENDED FOR SOME TIME IN EXPECTATION OF HIS SUBMISSION ALL THE SEVERITIES INDEED OF THIS REIGN WERE EXERCISED AGAINST THOSE WHO TRIUMPHED IN THEIR SUFFERINGS WHO COURTED PERSECUTION AND BRAVED AUTHORITY
363
HIS MINISTERS AND SERVANTS OF WHATEVER DEGREE IN CASE CF ANY VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION WERE ALONE CULPABLE ALL THE FARMERS AND OFFICERS OF THE CUSTOMS WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED DURING SO MANY YEARS IN LEVYING TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE AND THE NEW IMPOSITIONS WERE LIKEWISE DECLARED CRIMINALS AND WERE AFTERWARDS GLAD TO COMPOUND FOR A PARDON BY PAYING A FINE OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS
IT WAS THE SAME ASTLEY WHO BEFORE HE CHARGED AT THE BATTLE OF EDGEHILL MADE THIS SHORT PRAYER
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR NEAR CONNECTION OF BLOOD RECEIVED BUT FEW CIVILITIES AND STILL LESS SUPPORT FROM THE FRENCH COURT
AND HOPED THAT WHEN THE QUESTION REGARDED ONLY PERSONS NOT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NO ONE WOULD ANY LONGER BALANCE BETWEEN THE ANCIENT ROYAL FAMILY AND AN IGNOBLE USURPER WHO BY BLOOD TREASON AND PERFIDY HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE THRONE
WHEREVER ANY DIFFICULTY SHALL OCCUR THE ADMINISTRATION INSTEAD OF ENDEAVORING TO ELUDE OR OVERCOME IT BY GENTLE AND PRUDENT MEASURES WILL INSTANTLY REPRESENT IT AS A REASON FOR INFRINGING ALL ANCIENT LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE HOUSE PRETENDED TO TAKE FIRE AT THIS ANSWER

NOT TO MENTION THAT THE MUTINOUS SPIRIT WAS RISING HIGHER IN THE TIME OF LAUD AND WOULD LESS BEAR CONTROL
AND ADVANCING INTO THAT OF SOMERSET BEGAN TO REDUCE IT TO OBEDIENCE
STAT
THE PARLIAMENT WHEN THE REGAL DIGNITY WAS REJECTED BY CROMWELL FOUND THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO RETAIN THE NAME OF A COMMONWEALTH AND PROTECTOR
UPON THE SCOTTISH PACIFICATION HE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE EARL OF LEICESTER AGAINST THE IRISH REBELS
THE PRIMATE IT IS TRUE CONDUCTED THIS SCHEME NOT WITH THE ENLARGED SENTIMENTS AND COOL REFLECTION OF A LEGISLATOR BUT WITH THE INTEMPERATE ZEAL OF A SECTARY
641 643
THE HUGONOTS THOUGH THEY HAD NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT AGAINST THE FRENCH COURT WERE THOUGHT TO BE AS MUCH ENTITLED TO ASSISTANCE FROM ENGLAND AS IF THEY HAD TAKEN ARMS IN DEFENCE OF THEIR LIBERTIES AND RELIGION AGAINST THE PERSECUTING RAGE OF THE CATHOLICS
IN ALL BUSINESS IT HAD A SHARE
IN RETURN HE ONLY ASKED FOR HIS NECESSITIES A SUPPLY OF TWELVE SUBSIDIES,--ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS,--AND THAT PAYABLE IN THREE YEARS
HAD THE PRECEDING ADMINISTRATION OF THE KING WHICH WE ARE APT TO CALL ARBITRARY PROCEEDED FROM AMBITION AND AN UNJUST DESIRE OF ENCROACHING ON THE ANCIENT LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS REASON FOR GIVING HIM ANY TRUST OR LEAVING IN HIS HANDS A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF THAT POWER WHICH HE HAD SO MUCH ABUSED
THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THE ROYALISTS BEING UNITED FORMED THE VOICE OF THE NATION WHICH WITHOUT NOISE BUT WITH INFINITE ARDOR CALLED FOR THE KING'S RESTORATION
THEY SAW THESE SPECULATIVE PRINCIPLES REDUCED TO PRACTICE AND A WHOLE BODY OF ECCLESIASTICAL LAWS ESTABLISHED WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS CONSENT EITHER OF CHURCH OR STATE CLARENDON VOL
A HORROR AGAINST THE PAPISTS HOWEVER INNOCENT THEY HAD CONSTANTLY ENCOURAGED A TERROR FROM THE CONSPIRACIES OF THAT SECT HOWEVER IMPROBABLE THEY HAD AT ALL TIMES ENDEAVORED TO EXCITE
1649 THE CONFUSIONS WHICH OVERSPREAD ENGLAND AFTER THE MURDER OF CHARLES I PROCEEDED AS WELL FROM THE SPIRIT OF REFINEMENT AND INNOVATION WHICH AGITATED THE RULING PARTY AS FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF ALL THAT AUTHORITY BOTH CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL BY WHICH THE NATION HAD EVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BE GOVERNED
THEY INSISTED THAT THE LEAST OF CHRIST'S TRUTHS WAS SUPERIOR TO ALL POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THEY MAINTAINED THE ETERNAL OBLIGATION IMPOSED BY THE COVENANT TO EXTIRPATE HERESY AND SCHISM
IN THE SPACE OF A FEW MONTHS WITHOUT EFFUSION OF BLOOD BY HIS CAUTIOUS AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT ALONE HE HAD BESTOWED SETTLEMENT ON THREE KINGDOMS WHICH HAD LONG BEEN TORN WITH THE MOST VIOLENT CONVULSIONS
THE EARL OF ESSEX DISGUSTED WITH A WAR OF WHICH HE BEGAN TO FORESEE THE PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES ADHERED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND PROMOTED EVERY REASONABLE PLAN OF ACCOMMODATION
AND THE KING WHO HAD NO SUSPICION THAT ONE BORN A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN COULD ENTERTAIN THE DARING AMBITION OF SEIZING A SCEPTRE TRANSMITTED THROUGH A LONG LINE OF MONARCHS INDULGED HOPES THAT HE WOULD AT LAST EMBRACE A MEASURE WHICH BY ALL THE MOTIVES OF DUTY INTEREST AND SAFETY SEEMED TO BE RECOMMENDED TO HIM
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ONLY INSTANCES WHICH I FIND CITED TO CONFIRM THAT ACCUSATION
TEMPER ART AND ELOQUENCE IN DEBATE
A FREE MONARCHY IN WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS A SLAVE IS A GLARING CONTRADICTION
THOSE WHO WERE SO HAPPY AS TO FIND ACCESS EARLY IN THE MORNING KEPT THEIR PLACES THE WHOLE DAY THOSE WHO WERE EXCLUDED CLUNG TO THE DOORS OR WINDOWS IN HOPES OF CATCHING AT LEAST SOME DISTANT MURMUR OR BROKEN PHRASES OF THE HOLY RHETORIC ALL THE ELOQUENCE OF PARLIAMENT NOW WELL REFINED FROM PEDANTRY ANIMATED WITH THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY AND EMPLOYED IN THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERESTS WAS NOT ATTENDED TO WITH SUCH INSATIABLE AVIDITY AS WERE THESE LECTURES DELIVERED WITH RIDICULOUS CANT AND A PROVINCIAL ACCENT FULL OF BARBARISM AND OF IGNORANCE
RELIGION CAN NEVER BE DEEMED A POINT OF SMALL CONSEQUENCE IN CIVIL GOVERNMENT
THE MILITARY CONFESSORS WERE FURTHER ENCOURAGED IN DISOBEDIENCE TO SUPERIORS BY THAT SPIRITUAL PRIDE TO WHICH A MISTAKEN PIETY IS SO SUBJECT
THE RESTLESS LILBURN FOR NEW OFFENCES HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO A NEW TRIAL
I CHARGE YOU NEVER TO FORSAKE THE CROWN THOUGH IT SHOULD HANG UPON A BUSH THESE LAST WORDS ADDED WINDHAM MADE SUCH IMPRESSIONS ON ALL OUR BREASTS THAT THE MANY AFFLICTIONS OF THESE SAD TIMES COULD NEVER EFFACE THEIR INDELIBLE CHARACTERS FROM INNUMERABLE INSTANCES IT APPEARS HOW DEEP ROOTED IN THE MINDS OF THE ENGLISH GENTRY OF THAT AGE WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF LOYALTY TO THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND NO MAN SHALL KNOW BY WHAT RULE TO GOVERN HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS
THE SUM BY THEIR ACCOUNT AMOUNTED TO NEAR TWO MILLIONS
HE NEVER ASKED MORE FOR HIS WARES THAN THE PRECISE SUM WHICH HE WAS DETERMINED TO ACCEPT
AND AM SO FAR FROM DELIVERING UP THIS ISLAND TO YOUR ADVANTAGE THAT I SHALL KEEP IT TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER TO YOUR DESTRUCTION
HE HAD EVEN EMBRACED A RESOLUTION OF SENDING BY SEA ALL HIS FOOT AND ARTILLERY TO ENGLAND AND OF BREAKING THROUGH AT ALL HAZARDS WITH HIS CAVALRY
THE HIGHEST ASSESSMENT AMOUNTED TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS A MONTH IN ENGLAND
THE GREAT SOURCE WHENCE THE KING DERIVED CONSOLATION AMIDST ALL HIS CALAMITIES WAS UNDOUBTEDLY RELIGION
ALL RIGHT TO SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY OR EVEN TO PRIVATE JUDGMENT IN SPIRITUAL SUBJECTS WAS REFUSED TO PROFANE LAYMEN
BY THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS HE TRIUMPHED IN ALL DISCUSSIONS OF COOL AND TEMPERATE REASONING
THAT ILLUSION IF IT BE AN ILLUSION WHICH TEACHES US TO PAY A SACRED REGARD TO THE PERSONA OF PRINCES IS SO SALUTARY THAT TO DISSIPATE IT BY THE FORMAL TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF A SOVEREIGN WILL HAVE MORE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS UPON THE PEOPLE THAN THE EXAMPLE OF JUSTICE CAN BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE UPON PRINCES BY CHECKING THEIR CAREER OF TYRANNY
AND THE ALLOWING THE MURDERERS OF DORISLAUS TO ESCAPE AND THE CONNIVING AT THE INSULTS TO WHICH ST JOHN HAD BEEN EXPOSED WERE REPRESENTED AS SYMPTOMS OF AN UNFRIENDLY IF NOT A HOSTILE DISPOSITION IN THE STATES
NEVER MONARCH IN THE FULL TRIUMPH OF SUCCESS AND VICTORY WAS MORE DEAR TO HIS PEOPLE THAN HIS MISFORTUNES AND MAGNANIMITY HIS PATIENCE AND PIETY HAD RENDERED THIS UNHAPPY PRINCE
AND ALSO SUNDRY GRIEVOUS OFFENDERS BY COLOR THEREOF CLAIMING AN EXEMPTION HAVE ESCAPED THE PUNISHMENTS DUE TO THEM BY THE LAWS AND STATUTES OF THIS YOUR REALM BY REASON THAT DIVERS OF YOUR OFFICERS AND MINISTERS OF JUSTICE HAVE UNJUSTLY REFUSED OR FORBORNE TO PROCEED AGAINST SUCH OFFENDERS ACCORDING TO THE SAME LAWS AND STATUTES UPON PRETENCE THAT THE SAID OFFENDERS WERE PUNISHABLE ONLY BY MARTIAL LAW AND BY AUTHORITY OF SUCH COMMISSIONS AS AFORESAID
BUT THE GRIEVANCES WHICH TENDED CHIEFLY TO INFLAME THE PARLIAMENT AND NATION ESPECIALLY THE LATTER WERE THE SURPLICE THE RAILS PLACED ABOUT THE ALTAR THE BOWS EXACTED ON APPROACHING IT THE LITURGY THE BREACH OF THE SABBATH EMBROIDERED COPES LAWN SLEEVES THE USE OF THE RING IN MARRIAGE AND OF THE CROSS IN BAPTISM
BUT THE SAME LEVITY OF MIND STILL ATTENDED HIM AND THE SAME DISREGARD TO ENGAGEMENTS AND PROFESSIONS
THE CITIZENS EITHER OF THEMSELVES OR BY SUGGESTION BEGAN TO START DIFFICULTIES WITH REGARD TO A FURTHER LOAN WHICH WAS DEMANDED
AND HE HAD VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED A CONSPIRACY FORMED TO ASSASSINATE HIM
BUT DURING THIS PERIOD IT MAY BE REGARDED AS THE GREAT SPRING OF MEN'S ACTIONS AND DETERMINATIONS
THE STATE OF ENGLAND WAS SET BEFORE HIM THE CERTAINTY OF THE RESTORATION REPRESENTED AND THE PROSPECT OF GREAT FAVOR DISPLAYED IF HE WOULD ANTICIPATE THE VOWS OF THE KINGDOM AND RECEIVE THE KING INTO HIS FORTRESS
IT CONSISTED MERELY IN A GENERAL DECLARATION THAT THE GREAT CHARTER AND THE SIX STATUTES CONCEIVED TO BE EXPLANATIONS OF IT STAND STILL IN FORCE TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES
BUT WHILE THESE PRELATES WERE SO LIBERAL IN RAISING THE CROWN AT THE EXPENSE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY THEY MADE NO SCRUPLE OF ENCROACHING THEMSELVES ON THE ROYAL RIGHTS THE MOST INCONTESTABLE IN ORDER TO EXALT THE HIERARCHY AND PROCURE TO THEIR OWN ORDER DOMINION AND INDEPENDENCE
AND THE COVENANTERS WERE ALLOWED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION TO PROCEED IN ALL THEIR HOSTILE MEASURES
MAGISTRATES ARE ABOLISHED AS USELESS NOW THAT CHRIST HIMSELF IS IN PURITY AMONGST US AND HATH ERECTED THE KINGDOM OF THE SAINTS UPON EARTH
AND THEY DREW TOGETHER A CONSIDERABLE ARMY IN THOSE PARTS WHICH WERE EXTREMELY DEVOTED TO THE ROYAL CAUSE
A PREROGATIVE OF MUCH GREATER CONSEQUENCE THAN THE FORMER
AND THEIR FLEET INTERCEPTED THE GREATER PART OF THOSE WHICH WERE SENT BY THE QUEEN FROM HOLLAND
AND THE KING FINDING THAT PEACE COULD BE OBTAINED ON NO OTHER TERMS AT LAST YIELDED TO IT
WERE FURTHER ALARMED AT THE NEAR APPROACH OF THE ROYAL ARMY WHILE THEIR OWN FORCES LAY AT A DISTANCE
MOST OF THE MEMBERS AFTER SOME HESITATION SUBMITTED TO THIS CONDITION
193
193
AND DISPLAYED A SOCIAL TRIUMPH AND EXULTATION WHICH NO PRIVATE PROSPERITY EVEN THE GREATEST IS EVER ABLE FULLY TO INSPIRE
297
WHILE HE COULD ONLY OPPOSE TO THEM A NATION ENERVATED BY LONG PEACE AND LUKEWARM IN HIS SERVICE
YOU HAVE TAKEN THE WHOLE MACHINE OF GOVERNMENT IN PIECES SAID CHARLES IN A DISCOURSE TO THE PARLIAMENT
THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS THEY HAD ENDEAVORED AS FAR AS IN THEM LAY BY FORCE AND TERROR TO COMPEL THE PARLIAMENT TO JOIN WITH THEM
AND THE CHARMS OF POETRY MUSIC AND CONVERSATION OFTEN STOLE HIM FROM HIS ROUGHER OCCUPATIONS
A PRIVATE ASSASSINATION HE EVERY MOMENT LOOKED FOR
SEE WARWICK
THE NEXT ACTION AGAINST THE SPANIARDS WAS MORE HONORABLE THOUGH LESS PROFITABLE TO THE NATION
THE KING'S FORCES ARE COMPOSED OF GENTLEMEN'S YOUNGER SONS AND PERSONS OF GOOD QUALITY
AND NO DISTINCTION AT FIRST APPEARED BETWEEN SUCH AS DESIRED ONLY TO REPRESS THE EXORBITANCIES OF THE HIERARCHY AND SUCH AS PRETENDED TOTALLY TO ANNIHILATE EPISCOPAL JURISDICTION
THE COURTIERS AND GREAT NOBILITY IN THE OTHER PARTY CHECKED THE GROWTH OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY GENIUS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICERS
NEVER WAS A QUARREL MORE UNREAL THAN SEEMED AT FIRST THAN BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES
THAT THOUGH DUE REGARD HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN PAID DURING THIS REIGN TO THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE YET NO INVASION OF THEM HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER DELIBERATE AND VOLUNTARY
WHICH THOUGH THE KING DID NOT APPROVE OF IT HE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO ADOPT IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL THE SUSPICIONS ENTERTAINED AGAINST HIM
AND THE ABUSES OF POWER WHICH CAN WARRANT THE LATTER VIOLENCE ARE GREATER AND MORE ENORMOUS THAN THOSE WHICH WILL JUSTIFY THE FORMER
THAT THOSE WHO AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR BLOOD HAD HITHERTO DEFENDED THE PARLIAMENT FROM SO MANY DANGERS WOULD STILL CONTINUE WITH FIDELITY AND COURAGE TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION IN THIS VIGOROUS MEASURE
V PARL
V PARL
V PARL
V PARL
AND THEY OPENLY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD AT PRESENT MANY IMPORTANT PRETENSIONS CHIEFLY WITH REGARD TO RELIGION
CHAPTER LIX
THE ENGLISH MAINTAINED THAT THE KING BEING IN ENGLAND WAS COMPREHENDED WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THAT KINGDOM AND COULD NOT BE DISPOSED OF BY ANY FOREIGN NATION
AND WHEN LUDLOW TOOK UP ANOTHER CUSHION IN ORDER TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT THE GENERAL RAN DOWN STAIRS AND HAD ALMOST FALLEN IN THE HURRY
THE FORCED LOANS
THEY STIGMATIZED THE LITURGY AND CANONS AS POPISH
THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
BUT THEIR TROOPS BEING SO MUCH DISPERSED COULD AT PRESENT BE OF NO MANNER OF SERVICE
461 556
THE ARREARS THEREFORE OF THE SCOTS WERE FULLY PAID THEM
ON THE CONCLUSION OF EVERY CURSE HE BOWED TOWARDS THE EAST AND CRIED LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY AMEN THE IMPRECATIONS BEING ALL SO PIOUSLY FINISHED THERE WERE POURED OUT A NUMBER OF BLESSINGS UPON SUCH AS HAD ANY HAND IN FRAMING AND BUILDING THAT SACRED AND BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE AND ON SUCH AS HAD GIVEN OR SHOULD HEREAFTER GIVE TO IT ANY CHALICES PLATE ORNAMENTS OR UTENSILS
THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS
THE BISHOP OF NORWICH BY RIGOROUSLY INSISTING ON UNIFORMITY HAD BANISHED MANY INDUSTRIOUS TRADESMEN FROM THAT CITY AND CHASED THEM INTO HOLLAND THE DUTCH BEGAN TO BE MORE INTENT ON COMMERCE THAN ON ORTHODOXY
TO EXCITE A SENTIMENT OF PITY WAS THE ONLY EFFECT WHICH THIS INHUMAN INSULT WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE UPON HIM
BUT BESIDES THAT THIS EXTREME RIGOR HAD NEVER BEEN EXERCISED TOWARDS ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS AND MANY OBVIOUS INCONVENIENCIES MUST FOLLOW FROM THE INTERMISSION OF THE CUSTOMS THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHICH DETERRED CHARLES FROM COMPLYING WITH SO HARD A CONDITION
AND HE RELIED ON THEIR ASSEVERATIONS MUCH MORE THAN ON THE OPINION OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED PHYSICIANS
THEY CONFESSED THAT THE PARLIAMENT HAD ACHIEVED GREAT ENTERPRISES AND HAD SURMOUNTED MIGHTY DIFFICULTIES
FAIRFAX REQUIRED THEM TO SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
P 393 BY CONCERT THESE MET EARLY
839
HE HAD OBTAINED A LICENSE FROM ARCHBISHOP ABBOT'S CHAPLAIN
HERBERT WAS DEFEATED
WHEN THE PARLIAMENT APPREHENSIVE OF THE DANGER SENT THE EARL OF BEDFORD WITH A CONSIDERABLE FORCE AGAINST HIM
AND BLAKE WHO WAS VICTOR GAINED NOT MORE HONOR THAN TROMP WHO WAS VANQUISHED
AND EVERY WORD WHICH SHE UTTERED WAS RECEIVED WITH VENERATION AS THE MOST SACRED ORACLES
NEXT DAY WHEN THE COMMONS WERE TO MEET COLONEL PRIDE FORMERLY A DRAYMAN HAD ENVIRONED THE HOUSE WITH TWO REGIMENTS
THERE LAY MANY DIFFICULT PASSES BETWEEN DUNBAR AND BERWICK AND OF THESE LESLEY HAD TAKEN POSSESSION
124
THEY ALSO DESPATCHED MESSENGERS TO THE KING WHO WAS ARRIVED AT YORK
WHILE LAMBERT'S FORCES WERE ASSEMBLING AT NEWCASTLE HAZELRIG AND MORLEY TOOK POSSESSION OF PORTSMOUTH AND DECLARED FOR THE PARLIAMENT
AND HAVING SUPPRESSED LANERIC MONRO AND OTHER MODERATE PRESBYTERIANS HE PLACED THE POWER ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE VIOLENT PARTY
BEING SENSIBLE THAT MEN OF LETTERS OUGHT ALWAYS TO REGARD THEIR SYMPATHY OF TASTE AS A MORE POWERFUL BAND OF UNION THAN ANY DIFFERENCE OF PARTY OR OPINION AS A SOURCE OF ANIMOSITY
AS THE MILLENARIANS HAD A GREAT INTEREST IN THE ARMY IT WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO GAIN THEIR CONFIDENCE
HIS ALLIANCE WITH SWEDEN HE STILL SUPPORTED
BUT AS HE POSSESSED MORE VIGOR AND CAPACITY IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT HE MIGHT MAKE RESISTANCE
SINCE HE FOUND EVERY BODY SO ZEALOUS IN PROMOTING HIS HAPPY RESTORATION
BY THE HOPES OF GOOD PAY AND WARM QUARTERS
IT CANNOT BE BOUND
THE ENGLISH OF THE PALE AS THEY WERE CALLED OR THE OLD ENGLISH PLANTERS BEING ALL CATHOLICS IT WAS HOPED WOULD AFTERWARDS JOIN THE PARTY WHICH RESTORED THEIR RELIGION TO ITS ANCIENT SPLENDOR AND AUTHORITY
HIS GOOD SENSE WAS DISFIGURED BY A DEFERENCE TO PERSONS OF A CAPACITY INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
THE LAWS WILL FLOURISH THE MORE BY ITS DECAY
NEVER DID ANY ESTABLISHED POWER RECEIVE SO STRONG A DECLARATION OF ITS USURPATION AND INVALIDITY
THE POWER OF THE SWORD INSTEAD OF TEN WHICH THE KING NOW OFFERED WAS DEMANDED FOR TWENTY YEARS TOGETHER WITH A RIGHT TO LEVY WHATEVER MONEY THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD THINK PROPER FOR THE SUPPORT OF THEIR ARMIES
THEN WAS DISPLAYED THE MIGHTY AMBITION OF HAMBDEN TAUGHT DISGUISE NOT MODERATION FROM FORMER CONSTRAINT
THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG-RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY
RUTHVEN A SCOTCHMAN WHO HAD BEEN CREATED EARL OF BRENTFORD ACTED UNDER THE KING AS GENERAL
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SECTS WERE BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY GREAT
HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS SOME WITH WALKING SWORDS
AND THE AMBASSADOR SOON AFTER SIGNED WITH THE PROTECTOR A TREATY OF PEACE AND ALLIANCE WHICH WAS VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE ENGLISH COMMERCE
BY PURSUING HIM IN HIS RETREAT THEY HAD SO DISCREDITED HIS CAUSE AND DISCOURAGED HIS ADHERENTS AS TO HAVE FOREVER PREVENTED HIS COLLECTING AN ARMY ABLE TO MAKE HEAD AGAINST THEM
THAT HE HAD PROMISED NOT ONLY ON THE WORD OF A PRINCE BUT ALSO ON THAT OF A GENTLEMAN THE EXPRESSION WHICH HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO USE THAT AFTER THE SUPPLY WAS GRANTED THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD STILL HAVE LIBERTY TO CONTINUE THEIR DELIBERATIONS
TO MURDER HIM PRIVATELY WAS EXPOSED TO THE IMPUTATION OF INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY AGGRAVATED BY THE BASENESS OF SUCH A CRIME
THE OLD TESTAMENT PREFERABLY TO THE NEW WAS THE FAVORITE OF ALL THE SECTARIES
AND EVERY INSULT IF NOT VIOLENCE WAS TO BE DREADED FROM THAT ENTHUSIASTIC SOLDIERY WHO HATED HIS PERSON AND DESPISED HIS DIGNITY
HIS FAVOR WAS SUFFICIENT TO DISCREDIT ANY PRETENDER TO OFFICE OR ADVANCEMENT
THE SPORT OF IT NOT THE INHUMANITY GAVE OFFENCE
BEING DESIRED BY THE SPECTATORS TO PRAY WITH HER AND SPEAK TO HER HE ANSWERED THAT HE DURST NOT
AND HE POSSESSED ALL THE EXTERIOR AS WELL AS MANY OF THE ESSENTIAL QUALITIES WHICH FORM AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINCE
AND WAS CONFIRMED IN HIS REPUGNANCE BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF HIS WIFE WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM AND WAS HERSELF MUCH GOVERNED BY THE PRESBYTERIAN CLERGY
CONTINUED FROM THE REIGN OF WILLIAM AND MARY TO THE DEATH OF GEORGE II
217
PYM OPENED THE MATTER IN THE HOUSE ON THE FIRST INTIMATION OF A DISCOVERY PIERCY CONCEALED HIMSELF AND JERMYN WITHDREW BEYOND SEA
THAT THE ABSURD TRIAL WHICH HE HAD MADE OF A PARLIAMENT ELECTED BY HIMSELF APPOINTED PERPETUALLY TO ELECT THEIR SUCCESSORS PLAINLY PROVED THAT HE AIMED AT NOTHING BUT TEMPORARY EXPEDIENTS WAS TOTALLY AVERSE TO A FREE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT AND POSSESSED NOT THAT MATURE AND DELIBERATE REFLECTION WHICH COULD QUALIFY HIM TO ACT THE PART OF A LEGISLATOR
THESE ARTIFICES SOON PRODUCED THE INTENDED EFFECT
WHILE THE ARMIES WERE ENGAGED WITH THE UTMOST ARDOR NIGHT PUT AN END TO THE ACTION AND LEFT THE VICTORY UNDECIDED
AND MONTROSE HASTENING HIS ENTERPRISE LEST THE KING'S AGREEMENT WITH THE SCOTS SHOULD MAKE HIM REVOKE HIS COMMISSION SET OUT FOR THE ORKNEYS WITH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEN MOST OF THEM GERMANS
AND MAY NOW GO TO PLAY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO FALL OUT AMONG YOURSELVES THE CONDITION OF THE KING DURING THIS WHOLE WINTER WAS TO THE LAST DEGREE DISASTROUS AND MELANCHOLY
HE WAS NOW KNOWN TO BE THAT FELTON WHO HAD SERVED IN THE ARMY
IN WHICH THEY BESOUGHT HIS MAJESTY TO APPOINT SOME CONVENIENT PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT RESIDE TILL COMMITTEES COULD ATTEND HIM WITH PROPOSALS
AND BY CIRCUMSCRIBING IN SO MANY ARTICLES THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE GAVE ADDITIONAL SECURITY TO THE LIBERTIES OF THE SUBJECT
IT WAS OF A NATURE TOO IMPORTANT TO BE VOLUNTARY
THE MARQUIS OF WORCESTER A MAN PAST EIGHTY-FOUR WAS THE LAST IN ENGLAND THAT SUBMITTED TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARLIAMENT
HE WAS RESERVED DISTANT STATELY
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
11 MAY
THE OFFICERS ALSO EXPECTED THAT AS THESE MEMBERS HAD SUFFICIENTLY FELT THEIR OWN WEAKNESS THEY WOULD BE CONTENTED TO ACT IN SUBORDINATION TO THE MILITARY COMMANDERS AND WOULD THENCEFORTH ALLOW ALL THE AUTHORITY TO REMAIN WHERE THE POWER WAS SO VISIBLY VESTED
AT LENGTH A MOTION IN FORM WAS MADE BY ALDERMAN PACK ONE OF THE CITY MEMBERS FOR INVESTING THE PROTECTOR WITH THE DIGNITY OF KING
THE AUSTERE GENIUS OF STRAFFORD OCCUPIED IN THE PURSUITS OF AMBITION HAD NOT RENDERED HIS BREAST ALTOGETHER INACCESSIBLE TO THE TENDER PASSIONS OR SECURED HIM FROM THE DOMINION OF THE FAIR
WHILE THE LAW IN SEVERAL INSTANCES SEEMED TO BE VIOLATED THEY WENT NO FURTHER THAN SOME SECRET AND CALM MURMURS
SEE HISTORY OF ARCHBISHOP LAUD P
424
SO OFTEN TAUGHT THAT THE OFFICE OF KING WAS A USURPATION UPON CHRIST THEY WERE APT TO SUSPECT A PROTECTOR NOT TO BE ALTOGETHER COMPATIBLE WITH THAT DIVINE AUTHORITY
HE ISSUED AN EDICT WITH THE CONSENT OF HIS COUNCIL FOR EXACTING THE TENTH PENNY FROM THAT WHOLE PARTY
AND ALL THEIR GRIEVANCES THEY SAID WHICH AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN A TOTAL SUBVERSION OF THE CONSTITUTION PROCEEDED ENTIRELY FROM THE FORMED COMBINATION OF A POPISH FACTION WHO HAD EVER SWAYED THE KING'S COUNSELS WHO HAD ENDEAVORED BY AN UNINTERRUPTED EFFORT TO INTRODUCE THEIR SUPERSTITION INTO ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND WHO HAD NOW AT LAST EXCITED AN OPEN AND BLOODY REBELLION IN IRELAND THIS REMONSTRANCE SO FULL OF ACRIMONY AND VIOLENCE WAS A PLAIN SIGNAL FOR SOME FURTHER ATTACKS INTENDED ON ROYAL PREROGATIVE AND A DECLARATION THAT THE CONCESSIONS ALREADY MADE HOWEVER IMPORTANT WERE NOT TO BE REGARDED AS SATISFACTORY
COAT AND CONDUCT MONEY FOR THE SOLDIERY WAS LEVIED ON THE COUNTIES
AFTER SOME MARCHES AND COUNTERMARCHES ARGYLE CAME UP WITH HIM AT FAIVY CASTLE
AND IT SEEMED BUT A SMALL SACRIFICE TO CONSENT THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS SHOULD BE RENDERED INCAPABLE OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENTS.[V WALKER P
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND AFTERWARDS THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES AND THE ARMY WHO WERE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY THE ASSEMBLY SET FORTH A PUBLIC DECLARATION IN WHICH THEY PROTESTED THAT THEY DID NOT ESPOUSE ANY MALIGNANT QUARREL OR PARTY BUT FOUGHT MERELY ON THEIR FORMER GROUNDS OR PRINCIPLES
AND THE CALAMITIES OF HER FAMILY HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON HER
BUT WHAT MAY BE ESTEEMED PECULIAR TO THEM IS THAT THERE PREVAILED A HYPOCRITICAL PHRASE FOR EXPRESSING SO PRUDENTIAL A CONDUCT
PATENTS FOR MONOPOLIES ANNULLED
CARDINAL MAZARINE BY WHOM ALL THE COUNSELS OF FRANCE WERE DIRECTED WAS ARTFUL AND VIGILANT SUPPLE AND PATIENT FALSE AND INTRIGUING
THIS ARTFUL AND AUDACIOUS CONSPIRATOR HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THE PARLIAMENT WITH SUCH PROFOUND DISSIMULATION WITH SUCH REFINED HYPOCRISY THAT HE HAD LONG DECEIVED THOSE WHO BEING THEMSELVES VERY DEXTEROUS PRACTITIONERS IN THE SAME ARTS SHOULD NATURALLY HAVE ENTERTAINED THE MORE SUSPICION AGAINST OTHERS
HAD ALREADY DIFFUSED ITS INFLUENCE TO A WONDERFUL DEGREE
THE MODERATE TEMPER AND UNWARLIKE GENIUS OF THE TWO LAST PRINCES THE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH THEY LABORED AT HOME AND THE GREAT SECURITY WHICH THEY ENJOYED FROM FOREIGN ENEMIES HAD RENDERED THEM NEGLIGENT OF THE TRANSACTIONS ON THE CONTINENT
THOSE LOFTY IDEAS OF MONARCHICAL POWER WHICH WERE VERY COMMONLY ADOPTED DURING THAT AGE AND TO WHICH THE AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION GAVE SO PLAUSIBLE AN APPEARANCE WERE FIRMLY RIVETTED IN CHARLES
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER QUARTER FROM WHICH GREATER DANGERS WERE JUSTLY APPREHENDED
BUT A SMALL PART HAVING IMBIBED IN IRELAND A STRONG ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CATHOLICS AND HEARING THE KING'S PARTY UNIVERSALLY REPROACHED WITH POPERY SOON AFTER DESERTED TO THE PARLIAMENT
FROM THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE III
LEST THE NOBILITY AND MORE CONSIDERABLE GENTRY SOLICITING A SEAT IN THESE GREAT ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS SHOULD BESTOW A CONSIDERATION UPON THEM AND RENDER THEM IN THE EYES OF THE MULTITUDE A RIVAL TO THE PARLIAMENT
AND WHEN THE MEAT WAS SET UPON THE TABLE A SIGNAL WAS GIVEN
HAVING ONCE ENGAGED WITH THE PARLIAMENT HE WAS OBLIGED TO OBEY ORDERS
NEVER MAN SO ZEALOUS FOR A FACTION WAS SO MUCH RESPECTED AND ESTEEMED EVEN BY THE OPPOSITE FACTIONS
TEACH THEM NOT ADDED HE BY YOUR NEGLECTING YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THAT OF THE KINGDOM IN WHICH THEIRS TOO IS INVOLVED TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES BETRAYED AND THEIR INTERESTS ABANDONED TO THE RAGE AND MALICE OF AN IRRECONCILABLE ENEMY WHOM FOR YOUR SAKE THEY HAVE DARED TO PROVOKE

CHAPTER LVIII CHARLES I 1645 WHILE THE KING'S AFFAIRS DECLINED IN ENGLAND SOME EVENTS HAPPENED IN SCOTLAND WHICH SEEMED TO PROMISE HIM A MORE PROSPEROUS ISSUE OF THE QUARREL
THE KING THEN INFORMED THEM THAT HE WOULD WAIVE FOR THE PRESENT ALL PROSECUTION
AND HE THEREFORE TOOK CARE VERY EARLY AMONG MANY MILD AND RECONCILING EXPRESSIONS TO INFORM THE COMMONS THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN THESE DUTIES AS APPERTAINING TO HIS HEREDITARY PREROGATIVE
CROMWELL WHO WAS WITNESS TO THE MEETING OF THE ROYAL FAMILY CONFESSED THAT HE NEVER HAD BEEN PRESENT AT SO TENDER A SCENE
ALL AMBASSADORS AND PUBLIC MINISTERS OF KINGS PRINCES OR STATES REPAIRED TO HIM AND PROFESSED THE JOY OF THEIR MASTERS IN HIS BEHALF
AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES HE HASTENED WITH ALACRITY TO A PERIOD WHEN HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE MOST UNDOUBTED TESTIMONY OF THE DUTIFUL ATTACHMENT OF HIS SUBJECTS
AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE KING CROMWELL HIMSELF BEGAN TO ASPIRE TO A COMMAND WHERE SO MUCH GLORY HE SAW MIGHT BE WON AND SO MUCH AUTHORITY ACQUIRED
THAT THE CATHOLICS IN THE IRISH HOUSE OF COMMONS ASSISTED BY THE PROTESTANTS HAD SO DIMINISHED THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE AND THE POWER OF THE LIEUTENANT AS WOULD MUCH FACILITATE THE CONDUCTING TO ITS DESIRED EFFECT ANY CONSPIRACY OR COMBINATION WHICH COULD BE FORMED
FEW EVEN OF THE LEADERS SEEM TO HAVE HAD MORE ENLARGED VIEWS FOOTNOTE 15
THAT THEY HAD INVITED AND ENCOURAGED A FOREIGN POWER TO INVADE THE KINGDOM
THE ROYAL FAMILY SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE FRENCH MONARCH MIGHT RECEIVE GREAT ASSISTANCE FROM THAT NEIGHBORING KINGDOM
SOME PROPOSED AND SEEMINGLY WITH REASON TO MARCH DIRECTLY TO LONDON WHERE EVERY THING WAS IN CONFUSION WHERE THE ARMY OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS BAFFLED WEAKENED AND DISMAYED AND WHERE IT WAS HOPED EITHER BY AN INSURRECTION OF THE CITIZENS BY VICTORY OR BY TREATY A SPEEDY END MIGHT BE PUT TO THE CIVIL DISORDERS
AND HAVE INFERRED THAT THE PARLIAMENT COULD REPOSE NO CONFIDENCE IN HIS PROFESSIONS AND DECLARATIONS NOT EVEN IN HIS LAWS AND STATUTES
ALL THESE HE EITHER TOOK OR DISPERSED
WHAT RENDERED THEM SO BACKWARD AFTER SUCH PRECIPITATE STEPS AS THEY HAD FORMERLY TAKEN IS NOT EASILY EXPLAINED
AND THE ROYALISTS RETIRED TO LAMPORT AN OPEN TOWN IN THE COUNTY OF SOMERSET
THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED TO MEET AT ST JOHNSTONE'S
SHOULD THE WAR BE ONLY PROTRACTED BEYOND A CAMPAIGN AND WHO COULD EXPECT TO FINISH IT IN THAT PERIOD HIS TREASURES WOULD FAIL HIM
AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
AFTER A VIOLENT DEBATE OF THREE DAYS IT WAS CARRIED BY A MAJORITY OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE AGAINST EIGHTY-THREE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THAT THE KING'S CONCESSIONS WERE A FOUNDATION FOR THE HOUSES TO PROCEED UPON IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE KINGDOM
THE TYRANNY AND THE ANARCHY WHICH NOW EQUALLY OPPRESSED THE KINGDOM
AND THEIR COMMITTEES OF RELIGION HAD HITHERTO ASSUMED THE WHOLE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION
HAPPY
AND AS NO PLAN WAS POINTED OUT BY THE COMMONS FOR THE PAYMENT OF ARREARS THE SOLDIERS DREADED THAT AFTER THEY SHOULD BE DISBANDED OR EMBARKED FOR IRELAND THEIR ENEMIES WHO PREDOMINATED IN THE TWO HOUSES WOULD ENTIRELY DEFRAUD THEM OF THEIR RIGHT AND OPPRESS THEM WITH IMPUNITY
NOTE S P
V IT APPEARS THAT THE LATE KING'S REVENUE FROM 1637 TO THE MEETING OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT WAS ONLY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MAY BE ESTEEMED ILLEGAL
THAT TITHES ARE ABOLISHED AS JEWISH AND CEREMONIAL A GREAT BURDEN TO THE SAINTS OF GOD AND A DISCOURAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY AND TILLAGE
THE TREACHEROUS THE CRUEL THE UNRELENTING PHILIP ACCOMPANIED WITH ALL THE TERRORS OF A SPANISH INQUISITION WAS SCARCELY DURING THE PRECEDING CENTURY OPPOSED IN THE LOW COUNTRIES WITH MORE DETERMINED FURY THAN WAS NOW BY THE SCOTS THE MILD THE HUMANE CHARLES ATTENDED WITH HIS INOFFENSIVE LITURGY
THE PLAY-HOUSES HE AFFIRMS ARE SATAN'S CHAPELS
AND THEY PROPOSED AS A REMEDY THAT THE WHOLE MILITARY POWER SHOULD BE INTRUSTED TO SOME PERSON IN WHOM THEY MIGHT ALL CONFIDE
AND THEIR APPEARANCE WAS BUT A BAD PROGNOSTIC OF ITS EXTINCTION
AND WAS AT THAT VERY TIME ENGAGED IN DELIBERATIONS WITH REGARD TO THIS EXPEDIENT
I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
TO REMOVE THE POSTS AND CHAINS FROM ALL THE STREETS
AND MADE THE BILL OF ATTAINDER PASS THE COMMONS WITH NO GREATER OPPOSITION THAN THAT OF FIFTY-NINE DISSENTING VOTES
758
AND THAT TOWN WAS A SECOND TIME THE SCENE OF THE BLOODY ANIMOSITIES OF THE ENGLISH
AFTER THE MOST VIOLENT ANXIETY AND DOUBT CHARLES AT LAST GRANTED A COMMISSION TO FOUR NOBLEMEN TO GIVE THE ROYAL ASSENT IN HIS NAME TO THE BILL
BUT IN REALITY INSULTED THEM AND TYRANNIZED OVER THEM
CROMWELL WAS IN THE FIFTY-NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE WHEN HE DIED
SOME OF THE PRELATES POSSESSED PLACES IN THE EXCHEQUER
KILL SIN PIMPLE OF WITHAM
A NUMEROUS ARMY SERVED EQUALLY TO RETAIN EVERY ONE IN IMPLICIT SUBJECTION TO ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY AND TO STRIKE A TERROR INTO FOREIGN NATIONS
OATHS WERE BY MANY OF THE BISHOPS IMPOSED OR THE CHURCHWARDENS
THEY OPENLY CHALLENGED THE SUPERIORITY AND EVEN MENACED THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WITH THAT PERSECUTION WHICH THEY AFTERWARDS EXERCISED AGAINST HER WITH SUCH SEVERITY
AS HE BORE A RESEMBLANCE TO THE COMMON PICTURES OF CHRIST HE ALLOWED HIS BEARD TO GROW IN A LIKE FORM
AND EXCELLENT OFFICERS WERE FORMED IN EVERY BRANCH OF SERVICE
THE FORMER ADDITIONAL IMPOSITIONS WERE STILL EXACTED
WISHART CAP 13
THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
XXIII
HE UNITED IN A LEAGUE FOR THE KING THE COUNTIES OF NORTHUMBERLAND CUMBERLAND WESTMORELAND AND THE BISHOPRIC AND ENGAGED SOME TIME AFTER OTHER COUNTIES IN THE SAME ASSOCIATION
IV P 535 542
IN THE TREATY WHICH WAS SIGNED AFTER LONG NEGOTIATION THE PROTECTOR'S NAME WAS INSERTED BEFORE THE FRENCH KING'S IN THAT COPY WHICH REMAINED IN ENGLAND
IT WAS SENT UP TO THE LORDS AND SIGNED BY ALL OF THEM EXCEPT SOUTHAMPTON AND ROBARTS
THE BRITISH PROTESTANTS TRANSPLANTED INTO IRELAND HAVING EVERY MOMENT BEFORE THEIR EYES ALL THE HORRORS OF POPERY HAD NATURALLY BEEN CARRIED INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME AND HAD UNIVERSALLY ADOPTED THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF THE PURITANS
AND FOUND ASSISTANCE NOWHERE
SO DISGUSTED WERE ALL LOVERS OF CIVIL LIBERTY AT THE DOCTRINES PROMOTED BY THE CLERGY THAT THESE INVECTIVES WERE RECEIVED WITHOUT CONTROL
AFTER A DELIBERATION WHICH SCARCELY LASTED HALF AN HOUR AN IMPEACHMENT OF HIGH TREASON WAS VOTED AGAINST THIS SUBJECT THE FIRST BOTH IN RANK AND IN FAVOR THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
BY THE KING'S ORDER HE TOOK THE MACE FROM THE TABLE WHICH ENDED THEIR PROCEEDINGS AND A FEW DAYS AFTER THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED

SEE NOTE P AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
WHILE HIS WELL-WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY THAT ANCIENT SUPERSTITION LIKEWISE OF DESIRING THE KING'S TOUCH IN SCROFULOUS DISTEMPERS SEEMED TO ACQUIRE FRESH CREDIT AMONG THE PEOPLE FROM THE GENERAL TENDERNESS WHICH BEGAN TO PREVAIL FOR THIS VIRTUOUS AND UNHAPPY MONARCH
IN HOPES THAT BY ARTIFICE HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECONCILE THE REFRACTORY MINDS OF THE SOLDIERS TO HIS NEW DIGNITY
MONTROSE HAVING LAID DOWN HIS ARMS AT THE COMMAND OF THE LATE KING HAD RETIRED INTO FRANCE AND CONTRARY TO HIS NATURAL DISPOSITION HAD LIVED FOR SOME TIME INACTIVE AT PARIS
THEY DESPATCHED A BODY OF SIX HUNDRED MEN TO THROW RELIEF INTO TREDAH BESIEGED BY THE IRISH
THIS INTERVAL HE PASSED WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY CHIEFLY IN READING AND DEVOTION
AND WALLER RECEIVED ORDERS FROM ESSEX TO FOLLOW HIM AND WATCH HIS MOTIONS WHILE HE HIMSELF MARCHED INTO THE WEST IN QUEST OF PRINCE MAURICE
PARTLY FROM THIS INCIDENT PARTLY FROM THE FURIOUS SHOCK MADE UPON THEM BY THE PRINCE THAT WHOLE WING OF CAVALRY IMMEDIATELY FLED AND WERE PURSUED FOR TWO MILES
FROM THESE CAUSES ASSISTED BY THE ARTIFICE OF THE INDEPENDENTS THE TREATY WAS SPUN OUT TO SUCH A LENGTH THAT THE INVASIONS AND INSURRECTIONS WERE EVERY WHERE SUBDUED
THE COURT SAT IN WESTMINSTER HALL
HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD BETTER JUSTIFY ANY STRONG MEASURE WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS BE OBLIGED TO TAKE IF HE ALLOWED THEM TO CARRY TO THE UTMOST EXTREMITIES THEIR ATTACKS UPON HIS GOVERNMENT AND PREROGATIVE HE CONTENTED HIMSELF FOR THE PRESENT WITH SOLICITING THE HOUSE BY MESSAGES AND SPEECHES
AT THE SAME TIME THEY ADVANCED WITH THE ARMY TO WINDSOR AND SENT COLONEL EURE TO SEIZE THE KING'S PERSON AT NEWPORT AND CONVEY HIM TO HURST CASTLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE HE WAS DETAINED IN STRICT CONFINEMENT
NOTE T P
WHICH HE DID PURSUING HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT MORE ADO AND IGNORANT OF THE HARM HE HAD SUFFERED
AND IN SOME RESPECTS NOTWITHSTANDING THE ACCURATE GENIUS OF THAT GOVERNMENT THESE PRIVILEGES ARE AT PRESENT AS UNDETERMINED AS WERE FORMERLY THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN
NOR WAS IT NECESSARY TO WIDEN THEM FURTHER BY THESE INVENTIONS
BUT FLEETWOOD HIS SON-IN-LAW ACTUATED BY THE WILDEST ZEAL BEGAN TO ESTRANGE HIMSELF FROM HIM
NO MARRIAGES OR ALLIANCES CONTRACTED
HAD HE EVER INTENDED TO HAVE SET UP FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT SURELY HAVE SO SOON ABANDONED A PROJECT SO INVITING
THIS WAS REPRESENTED AS THE GREAT BASIS CF THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT REGULATING AND LIMITING THE POWERS OF EACH MEMBER OF THE CONSTITUTION AND SECURING THE LIBERTY OF THE PEOPLE TO THE MOST REMOTE POSTERITY
AND THAT IT BE TREASON FOR ANY ONE WITHOUT LEAVE OF THE TWO HOUSES TO HAVE ANY INTERCOURSE WITH HIM
WE WERE AT WINDSOR SAID CROMWELL WHEN WE RECEIVED THIS LETTER
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM EVEN WITHOUT ANY MILITARY PREPARATIONS GAVE IT SUFFICIENT SECURITY AGAINST ALL INVASION FROM FOREIGNERS
THESE REASONS JOINED TO SO MANY OCCASIONS OF ILL HUMOR SEEMED TO SWAY WITH THE GREATER NUMBER
GRIEVANCES WERE REGULARLY CLASSED UNDER THREE HEADS
BUT IF WITHIN TWENTY DAYS IT WERE NOT OBTAINED THEY WERE TO BECOME LAWS BY THE AUTHORITY ALONE OF PARLIAMENT
BUT THAT ARTFUL GENERAL KNEW AN EASY WAY OF DISAPPOINTING THEM
MONK APPEARED BEFORE IT
AND IN ORDER TO DIVERT IT THE KING THOUGHT PROPER UPON A JOINT APPLICATION OF THE LORDS AND COMMONS,[V TO ENDEAVOR GIVING THEM SATISFACTION WITH REGARD TO THE PETITION OF RIGHT
THE PEACE WAS AT LAST SIGNED BY CROMWELL NOW INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF PROTECTOR AND IT PROVES SUFFICIENTLY THAT THE WAR HAD BEEN IMPOLITIC SINCE AFTER THE MOST SIGNAL VICTORIES NO TERMS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS COULD BE OBTAINED
BUT DO NOT YOU THINK ANY THING IN THE WORLD WORTH ATTAINING BY FOUL AND UNJUST MEANS FOOTNOTE 20
THOUGH CHARLES KEPT HIMSELF RETIRED IN THIS CHAMBER THE BUTLER ONE POPE SOON KNEW HIM
HE ONLY ENTERED A PROTEST WHICH WAS ADMITTED THAT NO CONCESSION MADE BY HIM SHOULD BE VALID UNLESS THE WHOLE TREATY OF PACIFICATION WERE CONCLUDED WARWICK P
NO DISORDER HOWEVER ATTENDED IT
THE GREAT PLAN OF JAMES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF IRELAND CONTINUED BY CHARLES WAS BY JUSTICE AND PEACE TO RECONCILE THAT TURBULENT PEOPLE TO THE AUTHORITY OF LAWS
AND SO GREAT WAS THE BIGOTRY ON BOTH SIDES THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THE GREATEST CIVIL INTERESTS RATHER THAN RELINQUISH THE MOST MINUTE OF THEIR THEOLOGICAL CONTENTIONS
SIR EDWARD WALKER P
SIR EDWARD WALKER P
SIR EDWARD WALKER P
NO AUTHOR OR HISTORIAN OF THAT AGE MENTIONS THE DISCOVERY OF BUCKINGHAM'S IMPOSTURES AS A CAUSE OF DISGUST IN THE PARLIAMENT
CONNECTIONS WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS ATTENDED WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES BOTH TO THE KINGDOM AND TO THE HOUSE OF STUART
NEWS TOO ARRIVED THAT MONTROSE HIMSELF AFTER SOME MORE SUCCESSES WAS AT LAST ROUTED
OTHERS ON THE APPROACH OF THE DAY WERE TERRIFIED WITH THE DANGER OF THE UNDERTAKING AND REMAINED AT HOME
THESE OFFENCES WERE DECLARED TO BE HIGH TREASON
BURNET'S MEMOIRS OF THE HAMILTONS
THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY GRANTED THE KING THE SUPPLY OF FIVE SUBSIDIES THEY STILL RETAINED A PLEDGE IN THEIR HANDS WHICH THEY THOUGHT INSURED THEM SUCCESS IN ALL THEIR APPLICATIONS
CLARENDON ETC
RAY HAVING EXPORTED FULLER'S EARTH CONTRARY TO THE KING'S PROCLAMATION WAS BESIDES THE PILLORY CONDEMNED IN THE STAR CHAMBER TO A FINE OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS LIKE FINES WERE LEVIED ON TERRY EMAN AND OTHERS FOR DISOBEYING A PROCLAMATION WHICH FORBADE THE EXPORTATION OF GOLD.[V IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SUBSEQUENT CONVULSIONS EVEN THESE INCIDENTS ARE NOT TO BE OVERLOOKED AS FRIVOLOUS OR CONTEMPTIBLE
AND BESIDES GIVING A CONTINUED FIRE THEY PRESENTED AN INVINCIBLE RAMPART OF PIKES AGAINST THE FURIOUS SHOCK OF PRINCE RUPERT AND THOSE GALLANT TROOPS OF GENTRY OF WHICH THE ROYAL CAVALRY WAS CHIEFLY COMPOSED
IN SHORT FANATICISM MINGLING WITH FACTION PRIVATE INTEREST WITH THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY SYMPTOMS APPEARED ON ALL HANDS OF THE MOST DANGEROUS INSURRECTION AND DISORDER
MONTROSE ALSO AFTER HAVING EXPERIENCED STILL MORE VARIETY OF GOOD AND BAD FORTUNE THREW DOWN HIS ARMS AND RETIRED OUT OF THE KINGDOM
BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT GOOD GROUNDS THAT THE COMMONS WERE SO FIERCE AND ASSUMING
THE GREAT ZEAL OF THE CITY FACILITATED THIS UNDERTAKING
WHEREAS THERE HAS BEEN OF LATE A MOST DANGEROUS AND DESPERATE DESIGN UPON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WE HAVE JUST CAUSE TO BELIEVE AN EFFECT OF THE BLOODY COUNSELS OF PAPISTS AND OTHER ILL-AFFECTED PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY RAISED A REBELLION IN THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND
BUT THIS SCRUPLE OF THE KING'S AFFECTS ONLY THE BISHOPS BILL AND THAT AGAINST PRESSING
BY THE MOUTH OF THE LORD KEEPER FINCH HE DISCOVERED HIS WANTS AND INFORMED THEM THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSEMBLE HIS ARMY AND TO SUBSIST THEM NOT BY ANY REVENUE WHICH HE POSSESSED BUT BY MEANS OF A LARGE DEBT OF ABOVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE HAD CONTRACTED AND FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN SECURITY UPON THE CROWN LANDS
AT SHOREHAM IN SUSSEX A VESSEL WAS AT LAST FOUND IN WHICH HE EMBARKED
THE SELF-DENYING ORDINANCE HAD NO LONGER BEEN PUT IN EXECUTION THAN TILL ESSEX MANCHESTER WALLER AND THE OTHER OFFICERS OF THAT PARTY HAD RESIGNED THEIR COMMISSION
358 361
THE PREVALENCE OF THAT SECT IN THE PARLIAMENT DISCOVERED ITSELF FROM THE BEGINNING BY INSENSIBLE BUT DECISIVE SYMPTOMS
D'ESTRADES VOL
I DO PROMISE IN THE PRESENCE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND AS I HOPE FOR HIS BLESSING AND PROTECTION THAT I WILL TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER DEFEND AND MAINTAIN THE TRUE REFORMED PROTESTANT RELIGION ESTABLISHED IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD IN THE SAME WILL LIVE AND DIE
GORING WAS GOVERNOR OF PORTSMOUTH THE BEST FORTIFIED TOWN IN THE KINGDOM AND BY ITS SITUATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WHETHER THE CONDITION OF ENGLAND OR OF SCOTLAND WERE CONSIDERED SHOULD HAVE ENGAGED HIM TO DESIST FROM SO HAZARDOUS AN ATTEMPT
ALL THE OFFICERS IN HIS ARMY OF WHOM HE ENTERTAINED ANY SUSPICION HE IMMEDIATELY CASHIERED
CERTAIN ZEALOTS HAD ERECTED THEMSELVES INTO A SOCIETY FOR BUYING IN OF IMPROPRIATIONS AND TRANSFERRING THEM TO THE CHURCH
AND THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE THOUGH DEPRIVED OF ITS ANCIENT POWERS STILL MAINTAINS A DUE WEIGHT IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
IN ORDER TO CURE THE TYRANNICAL NOBILITY HE BOTH ABOLISHED ALL VASSALAGE AND REVIVED THE OFFICE OF JUSTICE OF PEACE WHICH KING JAMES HAD INTRODUCED BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT A LONG LINE OF FORTS AND GARRISONS WAS MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
LET US NOT ACT LIKE CAMBYSES'S JUDGES WHO WHEN THEIR APPROBATION WAS DEMANDED BY THE PRINCE TO SOME ILLEGAL MEASURE SAID THAT THOUGH THERE WAS A WRITTEN LAW THE PERSIAN KINGS MIGHT FOLLOW THEIR OWN WILL AND PLEASURE THIS WAS BASE FLATTERY FITTER FOR OUR REPROOF THAN OUR IMITATION
GREAT REGULARITY HOWEVER AND EVEN AUSTERITY OF MANNERS WERE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IN HIS COURT
SIR EDW
SIR EDW
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES EXPOSED TO THE DERISION OF THE PUBLIC
AND HE INDULGED HIS IMAGINATION IN VISIONS ILLUMINATIONS REVELATIONS
WALKER'S HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY PART II
WHEN THE NATION THEREFORE WAS SO GENERALLY DISCONTENTED AND LITTLE SUSPICION WAS ENTERTAINED OF ANY DESIGN TO SUBVERT THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY NO WONDER THAT ALMOST ALL ELECTIONS RAN IN FAVOR OF THOSE WHO BY THEIR HIGH PRETENSIONS TO PIETY AND PATRIOTISM HAD ENCOURAGED THE NATIONAL PREJUDICES
GORING COMMANDED IN THE WEST AN ARMY OF NEARLY THE SAME NUMBER ON OPENING THE CAMPAIGN THE KING FORMED THE PROJECT OF RELIEVING CHESTER
ESPECIALLY AS HE HAD PUT IT ENTIRELY OUT OF HIS POWER TO RETRACT THAT RESOLUTION
THE PULPITS RESOUNDED WITH VEHEMENT INVECTIVES AGAINST ANTICHRIST
HE LAMENTED THE MISFORTUNES OF HIS COUNTRY
THEY DETERMINED THAT NO MEMBER ABSENT AT THIS LAST VOTE SHOULD BE RECEIVED TILL HE SUBSCRIBED IT AS AGREE ABLE TO HIS JUDGMENT
499
THE PARTISANS OF THE COURT REASONED AFTER A DIFFERENT MANNER
THOUGH ALL OF THEM WERE AT BOTTOM EXTREMELY AVERSE TO IT
SALMONET LUDLOW HOLLIS ETC ALL THESE ESPECIALLY THE LAST BEING THE DECLARED INVETERATE ENEMIES OF CROMWELL ARE THE MORE TO BE CREDITED WHEN THEY ADVANCE ANY FACT WHICH MAY SERVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS VIOLENT AND CRIMINAL CONDUCT
THE SAME ILLEGALITY OF AN ACCUMULATIVE CRIME AND A CONSTRUCTIVE EVIDENCE WHICH APPEARED IN THE CASE OF STRAFFORD THE SAME VIOLENCE AND INIQUITY IN CONDUCTING THE TRIAL ARE CONSPICUOUS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS PROSECUTION
TO ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST HIM IN HIS PROJECTED INVASION OF GERMANY CHARLES AGREED TO FURNISH HIM WITH SIX THOUSAND MEN
THE DOCTRINES TOO OF FATE OR DESTINY WERE DEEMED BY THEM ESSENTIAL TO ALL RELIGION
I SHALL ADD TO WHAT THOSE AUTHORS HAVE ADVANCED THAT CARDINAL MAZARINE WISHED FOR THE KING'S RESTORATION
NO PEOPLE COULD UNDERGO A CHANGE MORE SUDDEN AND ENTIRE IN THEIR MANNERS THAN DID THE ENGLISH NATION DURING THIS PERIOD
AND THESE POWERS THOUGH NECESSARY FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE NATION AND EVEN WARRANTED BY ALL FORMER PRECEDENT YET NOT BEING AUTHORIZED BY STATUTE WERE NOW VOTED TO BE ILLEGAL AND THE PERSONS WHO HAD ASSUMED THEM DECLARED DELINQUENTS
WHAT PITY THAT SUCH A PRINCE SHOULD SO LONG HAVE BEEN HARASSED WITH RIGORS SUSPICIONS CALUMNIES COMPLAINTS ENCROACHMENTS
TO CALL A FREE PARLIAMENT AND TO RESTORE THE ROYAL FAMILY WERE VISIBLY IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF THE KINGDOM ONE AND THE SAME MEASURE
WHILE CHARLES I
SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
AND HE MARCHED TOWARDS THE KING WITH AN INTENTION OF OFFERING HIM BATTLE
MANWARING'S PARDON AND PROMOTION WERE TAKEN NOTICE OF
AND THE ENGLISH ARMY RUSHED IN UPON THEM
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE CHURCH MET AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE CONVENTION
AND GAVE NO OTHER REASON BUT THAT IF WE MET WITH A DEFEAT THERE WAS AN END OF OUR PRETENSIONS WE SHOULD ALL BE REBELS AND TRAITORS AND BE EXECUTED AND FORFEITED BY LAW CLARENDON VOL
OF THE PARLIAMENT P
AND EVEN THE SHIPS WERE CROWDED WITH THE ROYALISTS BOTH GENTRY AND CLERGY WHO ANGUISHED BELOW DECKS AND PERISHED IN THOSE UNHEALTHY CONFINEMENTS
BUT NO SOONER HAD HE ARRIVED AT THE HAGUE THAN HE WAS SET UPON BY SOME ROYALISTS CHIEFLY RETAINERS TO MONTROSE
FIVE GENTLEMEN ALONE SIR THOMAS DARNEL SIR JOHN CORBET SIR WALTER EARL SIR JOHN HEVENINGHAM AND SIR EDMOND HAMBDEN HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH AT THEIR OWN HAZARD AND EXPENSE TO DEFEND THE PUBLIC LIBERTIES AND TO DEMAND RELEASEMENT NOT AS A FAVOR FROM THE COURT BUT AS THEIR DUE BY THE LAWS OF THEIR COUNTRY NO PARTICULAR CAUSE WAS ASSIGNED OF THEIR COMMITMENT
ORMOND I CANNOT BUT ADD TO MY LONG LETTER THAT UPON THE WORD OF A CHRISTIAN I NEVER INTENDED GLAMORGAN SHOULD TREAT ANY THING WITHOUT YOUR APPROBATION MUCH LESS WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE
29

215 ETC
WHEN TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE ARMY THE CITY BEAT A PARLEY
HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE QUEEN WAS NOT INTERRUPTED
AT THE GATE OF THE CITY HE WAS MET BY THE MAGISTRATES AND PUT INTO A NEW CART PURPOSELY MADE WITH A HIGH CHAIR OR BENCH WHERE HE WUS PLACED THAT THE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A FULL VIEW OF HIM
NOTE F P
AND IN RUMMAGING THE HOUSE THEY FOUND IN A CORNER SOME NEGLECTED LETTERS WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN BY AS USELESS
EVER AFTER HE WAS LOOKED ON WITH AN EVIL EYE AT COURT FROM WHICH IN A GREAT MEASURE HE WITHDREW
MEN CONSIDERED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN NO OTHER LIGHT THAN AS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WHOSE INTEREST WAS THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE PUBLIC WHO WERE THE ETERNAL GUARDIANS OF LAW AND LIBERTY AND WHOM NO MOTIVE BUT THE NECESSARY DEFENCE OF THE PEOPLE COULD EVER ENGAGE IN AN OPPOSITION TO THE CROWN
TO ALL THESE EULOGIES HIS CONDUCT IN PRIVATE LIFE FULLY ENTITLED HIM
ONE PARTY LED BY LORD GRANDISON WAS INDEED BEATEN OFF AND THE COMMANDER HIMSELF MORTALLY WOUNDED
CONCEIVING HOPES FROM THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF IRELAND THEY RESOLVED TO MAKE AN ADVANTAGEOUS BARGAIN FOR THE SUCCORS WITH WHICH THEY SHOULD SUPPLY THEIR NEIGHBORING NATION
THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BEING TAKEN PRISONERS WERE CAPITALLY PUNISHED
AND AS HE FORESAW THAT THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE PEERS WOULD ADVISE HIM TO CALL A PARLIAMENT HE TOLD THEM IN HIS FIRST SPEECH THAT HE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THIS RESOLUTION
BY THE EARL OF DERBY'S DIRECTIONS HE WENT TO BOSCOBEL A LONE HOUSE IN THE BORDERS OF STAFFORDSHIRE INHABITED BY ONE PENDERELL A FARMER
EXCEPTING THEIR PRINCIPLES OF TOLERATION THE MAXIMS BY WHICH THE REPUBLICANS REGULATED ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS NO MORE PROGNOSTICATED ANY DURABLE SETTLEMENT THAN THOSE BY WHICH THEY CONDUCTED THEIR CIVIL CONCERNS
HE INVITED VISITS FROM THE RULING CLERGY OF ALL SECTS
AND BY THE SAID GREAT CHARTER AND OTHER THE LAWS AND STATUTES OF THIS YOUR REALM NO MAN OUGHT TO BE JUDGED TO DEATH BUT BY THE LAWS ESTABLISHED IN THIS YOUR REALM EITHER BY THE CUSTOMS OF THE SAME REALM OR BY ACTS OF PARLIAMENT
HER RELIGION LIKEWISE TO WHICH SHE WAS MUCH ADDICTED MUST BE REGARDED AS A GREAT MISFORTUNE
I SHALL SAY SOMETHING FOR MYSELF FOR MY OWN MIND I DO PROFESS IT I URN NOT A MAN SCRUPULOUS ABOUT WORDS OR NAMES OF SUCH THINGS I HAVE NOT

ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE LAUD'S INDULGENCE TO THE CATHOLICS AND SEVERITY TO THE PURITANS WOULD ADMIT OF APOLOGY
IT WAS HIS BOAST THAT HE WOULD RENDER THE NAME OF AN ENGLISHMAN AS MUCH FEARED AND REVERED AS EVER WAS THAT OF A ROMAN
BUT BEING ALL OF THEM MEN OF VIOLENT AMBITION SOME OF THEM MEN OF EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY THEY WERE RESOLVED SINCE THEY ENJOYED THE TITLE OF THE SUPREME AUTHORITY AND OBSERVED THAT SOME APPEARANCE OF A PARLIAMENT WAS REQUISITE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ARMY NOT TO ACT A SUBORDINATE PART TO THOSE WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THEMSELVES THEIR SERVANTS
AND EITHER SUBMIT ENTIRELY TO THAT PARLIAMENT WHICH HE HAD SUMMONED OR BY TOTALLY REJECTING ITS AUTHORITY LEAVE HIMSELF NO RESOURCE BUT IN HIS SEDITIOUS AND ENTHUSIASTIC ARMY
MURMURS BEING THROWN OUT AGAINST SOME PROMOTIONS WHICH HE HAD MADE WOULD YOU HAVE ME SAID HE PREFER NONE BUT THE GODLY
BY THE WILD FANATICISM WHICH HE HAD NOURISHED IN THE SOLDIERS HE HAD SEDUCED THEM INTO MEASURES FOR WHICH IF OPENLY PROPOSED TO THEM THEY WOULD HAVE ENTERTAINED THE UTMOST AVERSION
398
398
BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT
25TH MARCH 1626
ONE OF THE MINISTERS AFTER A MILE'S RUNNING TAKING ALL CREATURES FOR HIS FOES MEETING WITH A SOLDIER FELL ON HIS KNEES WHO KNOWING NOTHING OF THE MATTER ASKED THE BLACKCOAT WHAT HE MEANT
UNDER PRETENCE OF UNITING SCOTLAND AND IRELAND IN ONE COMMONWEALTH WITH ENGLAND CROMWELL HAD REDUCED THOSE KINGDOMS TO A TOTAL SUBJECTION
AND ALL WERE ADMITTED EVEN SUCH AS HAD FORMERLY BEEN EXCLUDED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR PRETENDED DELINQUENCY
THIS NATURAL INEQUALITY IN MILTON'S GENIUS WAS MUCH INCREASED BY THE INEQUALITIES IN HIS SUBJECT
MY CHILDREN SAID HE WE HAVE HITHERTO SEEN SERENE AND QUIET TIMES UNDER OUR THREE LAST SOVEREIGNS
THAT ABLE GENERAL LAID SIEGE TO STIRLING CASTLE AND THOUGH IT WAS WELL PROVIDED FOR DEFENCE IT WAS SOON SURRENDERED TO HIM
AND HAD REDUCED THE KING TO AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY IF HE WOULD PRESERVE ENTIRE THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE OF LEVYING THOSE DUTIES BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY AND OF BREAKING THROUGH THE FORMS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION
1652 BY THE TOTAL REDUCTION AND PACIFICATION OF THE BRITISH DOMINIONS THE PARLIAMENT HAD LEISURE TO LOOK ABROAD AND TO EXERT THEIR VIGOR IN FOREIGN ENTERPRISES
AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE KING AND HIS WANT OF ALL MILITARY STORES HAD ALSO RESTRAINED THE ACTIVITY OF THE ROYAL ARMY
AND THEY NOW INSISTED THAT THE PEERS UPON THIS GENERAL ACCUSATION SHOULD SEQUESTER THOSE BISHOPS FROM THEIR SEATS IN PARLIAMENT AND COMMIT THEM TO PRISON
THOUGH CROMWELL SOMETIMES EMPLOYED THE GROSS ARTIFICE OF FLATTERING OTHERS WITH HOPES OF THE SUCCESSION
613 JOURN
MILDMAY A NOTORIOUS MONOPOLIST YET HAVING ASSOCIATED HIMSELF WITH THE RULING PARTY WAS STILL ALLOWED TO KEEP HIS SEAT
THE HONOR OF THE FLAG WAS YIELDED TO THE ENGLISH
MONK INTERRUPTED HIM TO KNOW WHETHER HE HAD EVER BEFORE TO ANY BODY MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
BUT AS THEY WERE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING THE ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTION IN STATE AS WELL AS CHURCH THEY HAD AN OBJECT WHICH WAS NATURAL AND WHICH MIGHT PRODUCE THE GREATEST PASSION EVEN WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERABLE MIXTURE OF THEOLOGICAL FERVOR
AND THAT FACTIONS BEING ONCE EXCITED MEN CAN NEITHER SO FIRMLY REGULATE THE TEMPERS OF OTHERS NOR THEIR OWN AS TO INSURE THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL EXORBITANCES
IT WAS CALLED A WAITING UPON PROVIDENCE
BESIDES THEY ARE TYRANTS AND OPPRESSORS OF THE LIBERTY OF THE SAINTS AND TIE THEM TO LAWS AND ORDINANCES MERE HUMAN INVENTIONS
HAD THESE TROOPS ADVANCED UPON HIM THEY MUST SOON HAVE DISSIPATED THE SMALL FORCE WHICH HE HAD ASSEMBLED
TO ENGAGE THEM TO PROCEED BESIDES THEIR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRET DISCONTENTS OF THAT KINGDOM LORD SAVILLE HAD FORGED A LETTER IN THE NAME OF SIX NOBLEMEN THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OF ENGLAND BY WHICH THE SCOTS WERE INVITED TO ASSIST THEIR NEIGHBORS IN PROCURING A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES NOTWITHSTANDING THESE WARLIKE PREPARATIONS AND HOSTILE ATTEMPTS THE COVENANTERS STILL PRESERVED THE MOST PATHETIC AND MOST SUBMISSIVE LANGUAGE
AND ALL MEN SAW WITH ASTONISHMENT THE IRRESISTIBLE AUTHORITY OF THEIR JURISDICTION THE SANCTION OF THE LORDS AND COMMONS AS WELL AS THAT OF THE KING WAS DECLARED NECESSARY FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF ECCLESIASTICAL CANONS.[V AND THIS JUDGMENT IT MUST BE CONFESSED HOWEVER REASONABLE AT LEAST USEFUL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY BY ANY PRECEDENT.[V CLARENDON VOL
AND THAT ALL PRINCES HAD EVER SACRIFICED TO REASONS OF STATE THE INTERESTS OF THEIR RELIGION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

1641 THE SCOTS WHO BEGAN THESE FATAL COMMOTIONS THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD FINISHED A VERY PERILOUS UNDERTAKING MUCH TO THEIR PROFIT AND REPUTATION
THOUGH THESE WERE THE KING'S REFLECTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED HE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY BREAK WITH THEM UPON THEIR DELAY IN VOTING HIM THIS SUPPLY
REDEEMED COMPTON OF BATTLE
THOSE WHO LEVIED TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WERE BRANDED WITH THE SAME EPITHET
THE LATTER CAST THEIR EYE TOWARDS THE SAME OBJECT
THE SAME MEN AND THEIR DISCIPLES WERE THE STRENUOUS PREACHERS OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE AND OF ENTIRE SUBMISSION TO PRINCES
351
THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME
THEY MADE YET ONE EFFORT MORE IN THIS LAST AND MELANCHOLY SCENE WHEN ALL ENMITY ARISING FROM MOTIVES MERELY HUMAN IS COMMONLY SOFTENED AND DISARMED
THE PERSONS IN WHOM HE CHIEFLY CONFIDED WERE ALL OF THEM EXCEPTING BROGHILL MEN OF CIVIL CHARACTERS AND PROFESSIONS
AND THAT BY BARGAINING FOR THE REMISSION OF THAT DUTY THE COMMONS WOULD IN A MANNER RATIFY THE AUTHORITY BY WHICH IT HAD BEEN LEVIED
AND TURNING AGAINST THE KING THOSE VERY WEAPONS WITH WHICH HE HAD FURNISHED THEM RESOLVED TO PURSUE THE VICTORY
HE SENT A NUMEROUS DETACHMENT OF SAILORS IN THEIR LONG BOATS INTO THE HARBOR AND BURNED EVERY SHIP WHICH LAY THERE
AND BY ALL THESE ARTIFICES MORE THAN FROM ANY REGARD TO THE BEAUTY OF HIS GENIUS OF WHICH DURING THAT TIME OF FURIOUS CANT AND FACTION SMALL ACCOUNT WOULD BE MADE HE PREVAILED SO FAR AS TO HAVE HIS LIFE SPARED AND A FINE OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF IT THE SEVERITY EXERCISED AGAINST THE CONSPIRACY OR RATHER PROJECT OF WALLER INCREASED THE AUTHORITY OF THE PARLIAMENT AND SEEMED TO INSURE THEM AGAINST LIKE ATTEMPTS FOR THE FUTURE

IN THE PREAMBLE THEREFORE TO THE BILL BY WHICH THE COMMONS GRANTED THESE DUTIES TO THE KING THEY TOOK CARE IN THE STRONGEST AND MOST POSITIVE TERMS TO ASSERT THEIR OWN RIGHT OF BESTOWING THIS GIFT AND TO DIVEST THE CROWN OF ALL INDEPENDENT TITLE OF ASSUMING IT
BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS SEEMS APPARENT FROM THE SIMPLEST VIEW OF THESE TRANSACTIONS
EDINBURGH OPENED ITS GATES AND GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE PRISONERS THERE DETAINED BY THE COVENANTERS
NO REGULAR ESTABLISHED COMMONWEALTH COULD TAKE JUSTER MEASURES OR EXECUTE THEM WITH GREATER PROMPTITUDE THAN DID THIS TUMULTUOUS COMBINATION INFLAMED WITH BIGOTRY FOR RELIGIOUS TRIFLES AND FACTION WITHOUT A REASONABLE OBJECT
BUT THOUGH THE KING WAS NATURALLY THE GAINER BY SUCH A METHOD OF CONDUCTING WAR AND IT WAS BY FAVOR OF LAW THAT THE TRAIN BANDS WERE RAISED IN CORNWALL IT APPEARED THAT THOSE MAXIMS WERE NOW PREJUDICIAL TO THE ROYAL PARTY
NEGLECTING THE ENTREATIES OF HIS FRIENDS THE REMONSTRANCES OF HIS OFFICERS THE CRIES OF THE PEOPLE HE ENTERED THE CITY IN A MILITARY MANNER
AND THIS PETITION BEING READ EXAMINED AND APPROVED MAY BE DELIVERED TO THE KING
BUT NEXT MORNING THE KING TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD ALTERED HIS MIND
THIS MOTION AT FIRST EXCITED GREAT DISORDER AND DIVIDED THE WHOLE HOUSE INTO PARTIES
BUT TO HAVE MY LIBERTY WHICH IS THE SOUL OF MY LIFE RAVISHED FROM ME TO HAVE MY PERSON PENT UP IN A JAIL WITHOUT RELIEF BY LAW AND TO BE SO ADJUDGED,--O IMPROVIDENT ANCESTORS
AND WHEN THE KING WAS DEPARTING SOME MEMBERS CRIED ALOUD SO AS HE MIGHT HEAR THEM PRIVILEGE
FOR THE DUKE OF YORK HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE
AND JUST AS THE SENTENCE WAS PRONOUNCED IN HIS FAVOR
THOSE CONTESTS AMONG THE PARLIAMENTARY GENERALS WHICH HAD DISTURBED THEIR MILITARY OPERATIONS WERE RENEWED IN LONDON DURING THE WINTER SEASON
HE BRIDLED THE ROYALISTS BOTH BY THE ARMY WHICH HE RETAINED AND BY THOSE SECRET SPIES WHICH HE FOUND MEANS TO INTERMIX IN ALL THEIR COUNSELS
AND WHEN HE SAW HIS MEN RECOIL HE HIMSELF ADVANCED WITH A GOOD STAND OF PIKES AND PIERCING INTO THE THICKEST OF THE ENEMY WAS AT LAST OVERPOWERED BY NUMBERS AND TAKEN PRISONER

WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE EXTREME HARSH TREATMENT WHICH HE MET WITH AFTER MAKING THAT GREAT CONCESSION AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT BY THE REVENUE THEN SETTLED ON THE CROWN
THIS ORDINANCE WAS THE SUBJECT OF GREAT DEBATE AND FOR A LONG TIME RENT THE PARLIAMENT AND CITY INTO FACTIONS
HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS
THAT ALL THE CONSIDERABLE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN AND ALL THE JUDGES SHOULD BE APPOINTED BY PARLIAMENT
AT THE TIME WHEN THE PETITION OF RIGHT THAT REQUISITE VINDICATION OF A VIOLATED CONSTITUTION WAS EXTORTED FROM THE UNWILLING PRINCE WHO BUT IMAGINED THAT LIBERTY WAS AT LAST SECURED AND THAT THE LAWS WOULD THENCEFORTH MAINTAIN THEMSELVES IN OPPOSITION TO ARBITRARY AUTHORITY
EARLY THIS CAMPAIGN SIEGE WAS LAID TO DUNKIRK
AND THOUGH THE DEFENCE HAD BEEN OBSTINATE THE GARRISON WAS NOW REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY
IT SEEMED EVEN THE INTENTION OF MANY LEADERS IN THE PARLIAMENT TO ADMIT OF NO ESTABLISHED CHURCH AND TO LEAVE EVERY ONE WITHOUT ANY GUIDANCE OF THE MAGISTRATE TO EMBRACE WHATEVER SECT AND TO SUPPORT WHATEVER CLERGY WERE MOST AGREEABLE TO HIM
OBLIGED TO ATTEND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AT PRAYERS AND SERMONS THEY BETRAYED EVIDENT SYMPTOMS OF WEARINESS OR CONTEMPT
HE RENEWED HIS FATHER'S EDICT FOR ALLOWING SPORTS AND RECREATIONS ON SUNDAY TO SUCH AS ATTENDED PUBLIC WORSHIP
WHILE OTHERS THOUGHT THAT HIS CONDUCT IN THESE THREE PARTICULARS WOULD ADMIT OF APOLOGY AND EXTENUATION
AS A MONARCH TOO IN THE EXTERIOR QUALITIES HE EXCELLED
AND FAILED NOT TO FOMENT THOSE DISORDERS WHICH THEY PRETENDED TO APPEASE
THE DIVINES OF OXFORD SECURE AS THEY IMAGINED OF A VICTORY BY MEANS OF THEIR AUTHORITIES FROM CHURCH HISTORY THEIR QUOTATIONS FROM THE FATHERS AND THEIR SPIRITUAL ARGUMENTS DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH HENDERSON AND UNDERTOOK BY DINT OF REASONING TO CONVERT THAT GREAT APOSTLE OF THE NORTH
THE MILITARY USURPERS WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS FOUNDED ON PALPABLE INJUSTICE AND WAS SUPPORTED BY NO NATIONAL PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPELLED BY RAGE AND DESPAIR INTO SUCH SANGUINARY MEASURES
485
AND THEIR COMMON HATRED AGAINST HIM HAD LONG UNITED THE TWO PARTIES IN STRICT ALLIANCE WITH EACH OTHER
AND THE LARGEST AUTHORITY COMMITTED TO IT WAS ALTOGETHER AS LEGAL AS THE MOST MODERATE AND MOST LIMITED
BUT THOUGH THE INCIDENT HAD NO EFFECT IN SCOTLAND
AND ON NO BETTER FOUNDATION WAS WILLIAMS TRIED ANEW AS HAVING RECEIVED SCANDALOUS LETTERS AND NOT DISCOVERING THAT PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE
AND THOUGH ALL ANCIENT RULES OF GOVERNMENT ARE IN THAT CASE ABROGATED MEN WILL READILY OF THEMSELVES SUBMIT TO THAT IRREGULAR AUTHORITY WHICH IS EXERTED FOR THEIR PRESERVATION
IT IS BY WAY OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO YOU IN THIS WORK
THE REST WERE SOLD FOR SLAVES AND TRANSPORTED TO BARBADOES
WHAT RETARDED THE EXECUTION OF THESE PROJECTED CHANGES WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF SATISFYING ALL THOSE WHO FROM THEIR ACTIVITY AND AUTHORITY IN PARLIAMENT HAD PRETENSIONS FOR OFFICES AND WHO STILL HAD IT IN THEIR POWER TO EMBARRASS AND DISTRESS THE PUBLIC MEASURES
WITHOUT SCRUPLE OR DELAY HE RESOLVED TO PREVENT THEM
A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WEAKENS EVERY EVIDENCE
THERE IS NOTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO EXCUSE IF NOT TO JUSTIFY THE EXTREME RIGOR OF THE COMMONS TOWARDS CHARLES THAN HIS OPEN ENCOURAGEMENT AND AVOWAL OF SUCH GENERAL PRINCIPLES AS WERE ALTOGETHER INCOMPATIBLE WITH A LIMITED GOVERNMENT
TO BE TAKEN CAPTIVE AND LED IN TRIUMPH BY HIS INSOLENT ENEMIES WAS WHAT CHARLES JUSTLY ABHORRED
IT IS NOT STRANGE THAT MILTON RECEIVED NO ENCOURAGEMENT AFTER THE RESTORATION
AND HE HIMSELF GAVE ORDERS TO FIRE WITH THE SAME ALACRITY AS IF HE HAD COMMANDED A PLATOON OF HIS OWN SOLDIERS
THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN EXTENDED BEYOND ALL FORMER PRECEDENT

EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS A MONTH WERE REQUISITE FOR THE SUBSISTENCE OF THE TWO ARMIES
THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SUPPLY IT WAS HOPED WOULD ENGAGE THE COMMONS TO FORGET ALL PAST INJURIES

AND HAVING ALREADY A STRONG PROPENSITY TOWARDS REPUBLICAN AND PURITANICAL FACTIONS WOULD EXPECT BY THE SAME SEDITIOUS PRACTICES TO ATTAIN THE SAME INDULGENCE
BUT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE HE MIGHT HOPE TO REAP FROM THE DIVISIONS IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY HE WAS APPREHENSIVE LEST IT SHOULD COME TOO LATE TO SAVE HIM FROM THE DESTRUCTION WITH WHICH HE WAS INSTANTLY THREATENED
IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THE KING'S INTENTION WAS ONLY TO PREVENT INCONVENIENCIES WHICH AROSE FROM THE BRINGING OF EVERY CAUSE FROM THE MOST DISTANT PARTS OF THE KINGDOM INTO WESTMINSTER HALL
THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE CHARTER AND THE STATUTES AND BY THE TENOR OF THE ANCIENT CUSTOMS AND LAWS OF THE REALM EVERY SUBJECT HAS A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY IN HIS GOODS AND A FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTY OF HIS PERSON
ALL THESE DISTRACTED COUNCILS AND CONTRARY HUMORS CHECKED THE PROGRESS OF ORMOND AND ENABLED THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES IN IRELAND TO MAINTAIN THEIR GROUND AGAINST HIM
BUT THE FAR GREATER PART WERE LOW MECHANICS
OTHER ENDOWMENTS LIKEWISE HE HAD ATTAINED WHICH IN A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL AND WHICH IN A GREAT MONARCH MIGHT HAVE PROVED EXTREMELY USEFUL TO HIS PEOPLE
IT IS ALWAYS AN EXPRESS CLAUSE IN THE WRIT OF SUMMONS THAT NO SHERIFF SHALL BE CHOSEN
AND EVERY PROPOSAL MADE BY THE PROTECTOR HOWEVER UNREASONABLE IN ITSELF AND URGED WITH WHATEVER INSOLENCE MET WITH A READY COMPLIANCE FROM THE POLITIC AND TIMID CARDINAL
IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE CHURCH OF ROME AND THAT OF ENGLAND BEING BOTH OF THEM LOVERS OF FORM AND CEREMONY AND ORDER ARE MORE FRIENDS TO PRAYER THAN PREACHING
SINCE IT PROVED THE REALITY OF THOSE CONSPIRACIES WHICH HIS ENEMIES ON EVERY OCCASION REPRESENTED AS MERE FICTIONS INVENTED TO COLOR HIS TYRANNICAL SEVERITIES
230 231
NOR WERE THEY WILLING TO LOSE BY TOO HASTY SUCCESS THE ADVANTAGE WHICH THAT REBELLION WOULD AFFORD THEM IN THEIR PROJECTED ENCROACHMENTS ON THE PREROGATIVE

WHETHER IF UNLIMITED POWER WERE INTRUSTED TO THE PARLIAMENT DURING SO LONG A PERIOD IT WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR THEM TO FRAME THE SUBSEQUENT BILL IN THE MANNER MOST AGREEABLE TO THEMSELVES AND KEEP FOREVER POSSESSION OF THE SWORD AS WELL AS OF EVERY ARTICLE OF CIVIL POWER AND JURISDICTION THE TRUTH IS AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF WAR IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SECURITY FOR BOTH PARTIES ESPECIALLY FOR THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT

THAT IF THEY ADMITTED OF A TREATY THEIR PROPOSALS CONSIDERING THEIR PRESENT SITUATION WOULD BE SO EXORBITANT AS TO OPEN THE EYES OF THEIR MOST PARTIAL ADHERENTS AND TURN THE GENERAL FAVOR TO THE KING'S PARTY
HE SAW THAT HIS FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE WERE OUTNUMBERED BY HIS ENEMIES AND THAT THE SAME COUNSELS WERE STILL PREVALENT WHICH HAD EVER BRED SUCH OPPOSITION AND DISTURBANCE
JURIES WERE FOUND ALTOGETHER UNMANAGEABLE
THE ANSWER FROM THE CITY WAS IN THESE WORDS
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS MOVED BY THESE AND MANY OTHER OBVIOUS REASONS INSTEAD OF TAKING NOTICE OF THE KING'S COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIS SCOTTISH SUBJECTS OR HIS APPLICATIONS FOR SUPPLY ENTERED IMMEDIATELY UPON GRIEVANCES
THE AFFAIRS OF IRELAND WERE IN A CONDITION NO LESS FAVORABLE TO THE KING
WHILE HE STILL PRETENDED TO MAINTAIN REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES HE WAS TAKING LARGE STEPS TOWARDS THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE ANCIENT MONARCHY

MR CARTE IN HIS LIFE OF THE DUKE OF ORMOND HAS GIVEN US SOME EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THIS LETTER WAS ENTIRELY A FORGERY OF THE POPULAR LEADERS IN ORDER TO INDUCE THE KING TO SACRIFICE STRAFFORD
AND THEY WERE WILLING TO PAY COURT IN TIME TO THAT AUTHORITY WHICH BEGAN TO PREDOMINATE IN THE NATION
IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY
AND HIS INCLINATION AS WELL AS JUDGMENT WAS ENTIRELY ON THE SIDE OF THE COMMITTEE

AND EVEN BY NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE REASON IN CONTRADICTION TO LAW ITSELF WHICH THEY WOULD REPRESENT AS SO SACRED AND INVIOLABLE
LOUD COMPLAINTS OF THE PAST ACCOMPANIED WITH JEALOUS PROGNOSTICATIONS OF THE FUTURE
AND THEY EXHORTED HIM TO SEEK BY PRAYER SOME DIRECTION FROM HEAVEN ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION
BOOTH WAS OF A FAMILY EMINENTLY PRESBYTERIAN
HE WAS FORCED BY STRESS OF WEATHER AS HE ALLEGED TO TAKE SHELTER IN THE ROAD OF DOVER WHERE HE MET WITH BLAKE WHO COMMANDED AN ENGLISH FLEET MUCH INFERIOR IN NUMBER
THE NUMBERS FOR HIS CONDEMNATION AND HIS ACQUITTAL WERE EQUAL
AND INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN TO THESE COMMISSIONERS NOT TO ACCEPT OF A LESS SUM THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN DUE BY THE PARTY UPON A TAX OF THREE SUBSIDIES AND A HALF NOTHING PROVES MORE PLAINLY HOW ILL DISPOSED THE PEOPLE WERE TO THE MEASURES OF THE CROWN THAN TO OBSERVE THAT THEY LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF AN EXPEDIENT FOUNDED ON POSITIVE STATUTE AND WARRANTED BY SUCH RECENT PRECEDENTS

AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
DISEASES OF UNKNOWN NAME AND SPECIES DERIVED FROM THESE MULTIPLIED DISTRESSES SEIZED MANY OF THEM AND PUT A SPEEDY PERIOD TO THEIR LIVES

TWO SUPREME INDEPENDENT JUDICATURES WERE ERECTED IN THE KINGDOM
MEANWHILE THESE MILITARY SOVEREIGNS FOUND THEMSELVES SURROUNDED ON ALL HANDS WITH INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
A DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR THE EXECUTION OF ALL THESE ENTERPRISES
IT IS A PRINCIPLE ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT MONTESQUIEU THAT WHERE THE MAGISTRATE IS SATISFIED WITH THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HE OUGHT TO REPRESS THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TOWARDS INNOVATION AND ONLY GRANT A TOLERATION TO SECTS THAT ARE DIFFUSED AND ESTABLISHED
AND EVEN THE MERCHANT WHO SHOULD VOLUNTARILY PAY THESE DUTIES WERE DENOMINATED BETRAYERS OF ENGLISH LIBERTY AND PUBLIC ENEMIES
HIS FOREIGN ENTERPRISES THOUGH FULL OF INTREPIDITY WERE PERNICIOUS TO NATIONAL INTEREST AND SEEM MORE THE RESULT OF IMPETUOUS FURY OR NARROW PREJUDICES THAN OF COOL FORESIGHT AND DELIBERATION

IT HAD BEEN A USUAL POLICY OF THE PRESBYTERIAN ECCLESIASTICS TO SETTLE A CHAPLAIN IN THE GREAT FAMILIES WHO ACTED AS A SPY UPON HIS MASTER AND GAVE THEM INTELLIGENCE OF THE MOST PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS AND DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY
BUT THIS ARMY FORMIDABLE FROM ITS DISCIPLINE AND COURAGE AS WELL AS ITS NUMBERS WAS ACTUATED BY A SPIRIT THAT RENDERED IT DANGEROUS TO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH HAD ASSUMED THE COMMAND OVER IT
NOR WAS THERE ANY APPEAL FROM THEM BUT TO THE PROTECTOR HIMSELF AND HIS COUNCIL
TROMP ASSERTED THAT HE WAS PREPARING TO STRIKE AND THAT THE ENGLISH ADMIRAL NEVERTHELESS BEGAN HOSTILITIES
SO CONGENIAL TO THE HUMAN MIND ARE RELIGIONS SENTIMENTS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNTERFEIT LONG THESE HOLY FERVORS WITHOUT FEELING SOME SHARE OF THE ASSUMED WARMTH
BUT AS HE NOW EMPLOYED ALL HIS COUNSELS TO SUPPORT THE PREROGATIVE WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY BENT ALL HIS ENDEAVORS TO DIMINISH HIS VIRTUE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY PURE BUT TO HAVE BEEN SUSCEPTIBLE OF STRONG IMPRESSIONS FROM PRIVATE INTEREST AND AMBITION
THERE THE SON HAVING LONG SUPPORTED HIS AGED PARENT WITH RELUCTANCE OBEYED HIS LAST COMMANDS AND ABANDONING HIM IN THIS UTTERMOST DISTRESS RESERVED HIMSELF TO THE HOPES OF AVENGING THAT DEATH WHICH ALL HIS EFFORTS COULD NOT PREVENT NOR DELAY

THE CUSTOMS ON EXPORTATION WERE LOWERED IN 1656 IN 1650 COMMISSIONERS WERE APPOINTED TO LEVY BOTH CUSTOMS AND EXCISES
AND FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT IF HE WERE REMOVED FROM THE FURY OF THE AGITATORS BY WHICH HIS LIFE WAS IMMEDIATELY THREATENED THEY WOULD EXECUTE WHAT THEY HAD SO OFTEN PROMISED IN HIS FAVOR
HE WAS ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON IN ENDEAVORING TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND OF OTHER HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS
THE PUNISHMENT METHINKS EXCEEDS THE OFFENCE THIS WAS THE REFLECTION WHICH CHARLES FORMED ON THAT OCCASION AS SOON AS THE INTENTION OF TRYING THE KING WAS KNOWN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES SO ENORMOUS AN ACTION WAS EXCLAIMED AGAINST BY THE GENERAL VOICE OF REASON AND HUMANITY
THAT IT IS DANGEROUS FOR PRINCES EVEN FROM THE APPEARANCE OF NECESSITY TO ASSUME MORE AUTHORITY THAN THE LAWS HAVE ALLOWED THEM
WHERE THE PERIL IS URGENT AND EXTREME IT WILL BE PALPABLE TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY

IN ORDER TO SERVE BOTH THESE PURPOSES AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURE THE DOMINION OF IRELAND TO THE ENGLISH CROWN GREAT COLONIES OF BRITISH HAD BEEN CARRIED OVER AND BEING INTERMIXED WITH THE IRISH HAD EVERY WHERE INTRODUCED A NEW FACE OF THINGS INTO THAT COUNTRY

WHATEVER MEASURE IS EMBRACED WITHOUT CONSULTING THEM MAY BE PRONOUNCED AN OPPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE
AND SOME HISTORIANS EVEN AT PRESENT WHEN THE ANCIENT BIGOTRY IS SOMEWHAT ABATED ARE DESIROUS OF REPRESENTING THIS VERY INNOCENT TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE KING WAS ENGAGED BY THE MOST VIOLENT NECESSITY AS A STAIN ON THE MEMORY OF THAT UNFORTUNATE PRINCE 16 RUSH VOL
THE TERMS GIVEN TO MOST OF THEM WERE HONORABLE
HE POSSESSED TALENTS FOR ELOQUENCE AS WELL AS POETRY
300 AFTER A BREACH WITH THE PARLIAMENT WHICH SEEMED SO DIFFICULT TO REPAIR THE ONLY RATIONAL COUNSEL WHICH CHARLES COULD PURSUE WAS IMMEDIATELY TO CONCLUDE A PEACE WITH SPAIN AND TO RENDER HIMSELF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE INDEPENDENT OF HIS PEOPLE WHO DISCOVERED SO LITTLE INCLINATION TO SUPPORT HIM OR RATHER WHO SEEMED TO HAVE FORMED A DETERMINED RESOLUTION TO ABRIDGE HIS AUTHORITY
HE SEEMED VERY ANXIOUS AT THIS TIME TO BE ADMITTED TO A CONFERENCE WITH THE TWO HOUSES
154 RUSH
ESSEX DREW UP HIS MEN TO RECEIVE HIM
HOWEVER ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE SPEAKER BEING INFORMED THAT A QUORUM OF THE HOUSE WAS LIKELY TO MEET THOUGHT PROPER NOTWITHSTANDING THE SALVATION OF HIS SOUL AS LUDLOW OBSERVES TO JOIN THEM
WHILE THE PROTECTOR ARGUED SO MUCH IN CONTRADICTION BOTH TO HIS JUDGMENT AND INCLINATION IT IS NO WONDER THAT HIS ELOCUTION ALWAYS CONFUSED EMBARRASSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN TENFOLD DARKNESS AND DISCOVER NO GLIMMERING OF COMMON SENSE OR REASON
AND ALL THESE GRIEVANCES THEY ASCRIBED SOLELY TO THE ILL CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM THIS REMONSTRANCE WAS PERHAPS NOT THE LESS PROVOKING TO CHARLES BECAUSE JOINED TO THE EXTREME ACRIMONY OF THE SUBJECT THERE WERE PRESERVED IN IT AS IN MOST OF THE REMONSTRANCES OF THAT AGE AN AFFECTED CIVILITY AND SUBMISSION IN THE LANGUAGE
AND CHARLES WHO THOUGH COMMONLY MODERATE IN HIS TEMPER WAS EVER DISPOSED TO HASTY RESOLUTIONS GAVE WAY TO THE FATAL IMPORTUNITY OF HIS FRIENDS AND SERVANTS CLARENDON VOL
AND BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT HOLDEN IN THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING EDWARD III IT IS DECLARED AND ENACTED THAT FROM THENCEFORTH NO PERSON SHALL BE COMPELLED TO MAKE ANY LOANS TO THE KING AGAINST HIS WILL BECAUSE SUCH LOANS WERE AGAINST REASON AND THE FRANCHISE OF THE LAND
BUT WAR RECOMMENCED WITH GREAT APPEARANCE OF DISADVANTAGE TO THE KING'S PARTY
THIS YOUNG PRINCE WAS IN A SITUATION WHICH VERY ILL SUITED HIS TEMPER AND DISPOSITION
THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
EVEN DESBOROW THE PROTECTOR'S UNCLE LENT HIS AUTHORITY TO THAT FACTION
WHEN THE ENGLISH LAY OFF PORTLAND THEY DESCRIED NEAR BREAK OF DAY A DUTCH FLEET OF SEVENTY-SIX VESSELS SAILING UP THE CHANNEL ALONG WITH A CONVOY OF THREE HUNDRED MERCHANTMEN WHO HAD RECEIVED ORDERS TO WAIT AT THE ISLE OF RHE TILL THE FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE TO ESCORT THEM
WHATEVER UNFORTUNATE WHATEVER INVIDIOUS WHATEVER SUSPICIOUS MEASURE HAD BEEN EMBRACED BY THE KING FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS REIGN IS INSISTED ON AND AGGRAVATED WITH MERCILESS RHETORIC
THEY AIMED ONLY AT SECURING THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN TRANSMITTED THEM FROM THEIR ANCESTORS
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
SEE DR BIRCH P
HIS PARADISE LOST WAS LONG NEGLECTED
A CONSPIRACY TO ERECT NEW RAMPARTS IN ORDER TO STRAITEN HIS AUTHORITY APPEARED BUT ONE DEGREE REMOVED FROM OPEN SEDITION AND REBELLION
BUT WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO A DEMONSTRATION THAT GLAMORGAN WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD NO POWERS TO CONCLUDE A TREATY ON THESE TERMS OR WITHOUT CONSULTING THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND DID NOT EVEN EXPECT THAT THE KING WOULD RATIFY THE ARTICLES IS THE DEFEASANCE WHICH HE GAVE TO THE IRISH COUNCIL AT THE TIME OF SIGNING THE TREATY
AND FROM ONE EXTREMITY TO THE OTHER THERE WAS NO NAVAL FORCE CHRISTIAN OR MAHOMETAN ABLE TO RESIST THEM
YET SUCH WAS THE KING'S SITUATION THAT NO PROVISION COULD BE MADE NOR WAS EVEN ANY RESOLUTION TAKEN AGAINST SUCH AN EXIGENCY
HE SECRETLY WENT FROM CHIEFTAIN TO CHIEFTAIN AND ROUSED UP EVERY LATENT PRINCIPLE OF DISCONTENT
AND HE PLACED GUARDS AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHO ALLOWED NONE BUT SUBSCRIBERS TO ENTER
WILLING TO PRESERVE THE ANCIENT HARMONY OF THE CONSTITUTION HE HAD EVER INTENDED TO COMPLY AS FAR AS HE EASILY COULD WITH THE ANCIENT FORMS OF ADMINISTRATION
SUCH AT LEAST IS THE REPRESENTATION MADE BY HISTORIANS OF CROMWELL'S ADMINISTRATION
HE IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED HIS INTELLIGENCE TO THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT
AND ARBITRARILY TO INTRODUCE IT INTO THE FATAL CATALOGUE IS ITSELF A SUBVERSION OF ALL LAW
UNHAPPILY HIS FATE THREW HIM INTO A PERIOD WHEN THE PRECEDENTS OF MANY FORMER REIGNS SAVORED STRONGLY OF ARBITRARY POWER AND THE GENIUS OF THE PEOPLE RAN VIOLENTLY TOWARDS LIBERTY
THE REPUBLICANS BEING DETHRONED BY CROMWELL WERE THE PARTY WHOSE RESENTMENT HE HAD THE GREATEST REASON TO APPREHEND
BY COLLECTING INTO ONE EFFORT ALL THE DANGEROUS AND OPPRESSIVE CLAIMS OF HIS PREROGATIVE CHARLES HAD EXPOSED THEM TO THE HAZARD OF ONE ASSAULT AND HAD FURTHER BY PRESENTING A NEARER VIEW OF THE CONSEQUENCES ATTENDING THEM ROUSED THE INDEPENDENT GENIUS OF THE COMMONS
AND NO MAN WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXTENT OR LIMITS OF HIS AUTHORITY
THE SWORD ALONE TO WHICH ALL HUMAN ORDINANCES MUST SUBMIT COULD GUARD THEIR ACQUIRED POWER AND FULLY INSURE TO THEM PERSONAL SAFETY AGAINST THE RISING INDIGNATION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND AS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD BEEN DENIED BY POLLARD ASHBURNHAM AND WILMOT IN ALL THEIR EXAMINATIONS IT WAS REGARDED AS A NEW PROOF OF SOME DESPERATE RESOLUTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN
HE PERMITTED NO CHURCH ASSEMBLIES
NIGHT PARTED THEM IN THE GREATEST HEAT OF THE ACTION
BUT THE KING CERTAINLY REASONED RIGHT IN THAT CONCLUSION
BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE DUKE'S ANSWER IN THESE PARTICULARS AS IN ALL THE REST IS SO CLEAR AND SATISFACTORY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUSE OUR ASSENT TO IT HIS FAULTS AND BLEMISHES WERE IN MANY RESPECTS VERY GREAT
PETITIONS FRAMED IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF OPPOSITION WERE PRESENTED TO THE PARLIAMENT BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL LILBURN THE PERSON WHO FOR DISPERSING SEDITIOUS LIBELS HAD FORMERLY BEEN TREATED WITH SUCH SEVERITY BY THE STAR CHAMBER
AN INDULGENCE AMOUNTING ALMOST TO A TOLERATION HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE CATHOLIC RELIGION
THE ACTS OF PARLIAMENT WHICH AFFECTED ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS WERE SUPPOSED ON THAT VERY ACCOUNT TO HAVE NO MANNER OF AUTHORITY
133
133
THE KING HAD NO DOUBT IN SOME PARTICULARS OF MOMENT INVADED FROM A SEEMING NECESSITY THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS PEOPLE
WHEN THE KING CAME UPON THE SCAFFOLD HE FOUND IT SO SURROUNDED WITH SOLDIERS THAT HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE HEARD BY ANY OF THE PEOPLE
IT IS IN VAIN THEREFORE TO DIGNIFY THIS CIVIL WAR AND THE PARLIAMENTARY AUTHORS OF IT BY SUPPOSING IT TO HAVE ANY OTHER CONSIDERABLE FOUNDATION THAN THEOLOGICAL ZEAL THAT GREAT SOURCE OF ANIMOSITY AMONG MEN
23 24
TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE CONTINUED TO BE LEVIED BY THE ROYAL AUTHORITY ALONE
AND IF THE HOUSE BE NOT READY BY THAT TIME TO DO WHAT IS FIT FOR THEMSELVES IT SHALL BE THEIR OWN FAULT ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION HE ASKED THEM WHY DEMAND EXPLANATIONS IF YOU DOUBT NOT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STATUTES ACCORDING TO THEIR TRUE MEANING
1640 THE KING WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY FOUND MEANS TO DRAW TOGETHER AN ARMY
AND NEITHER THE BANDITTI OF THE MOUNTAINS NOR THE BIGOTS OF THE LOW COUNTRIES COULD INDULGE THEIR INCLINATION TO TURBULENCE AND DISORDER
ELEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WERE THEN OFFERED BOTH FOR CUSTOMS AND EXCISE A GREATER SUM THAN HAD EVER BEEN LEVIED BY THE COMMISSIONERS THE WHOLE OF THE TAXES DURING THAT PERIOD MIGHT AT A MEDIUM AMOUNT TO ABOVE TWO MILLIONS A YEAR
AND ALL HIS FRIENDS IN BRITAIN AND IN EVERY PART OF EUROPE REMAINED IN THE MOST ANXIOUS SUSPENSE WITH REGARD TO HIS FORTUNES
THE KING'S ADHERENTS WERE THE WICKED AND THE MALIGNANT
PYM WAS CHOSEN TO CARRY IT UP TO THE LORDS
AND THE COUNTY OF STAFFORD IN PARTICULAR EXPRESSED SUCH DREAD OF AN INSURRECTION AMONG THE PAPISTS THAT EVERY MAN THEY SAID WAS CONSTRAINED TO STAND UPON HIS GUARD NOT EVEN DARING TO GO TO CHURCH UNARMED.[V RUSH
THE ROYALISTS HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED BY THE KING TO REMAIN QUIET AND TO COVER THEMSELVES UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF REPUBLICANS
THAT TOWN THOUGH VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED BY NEWCASTLE WAS REDUCED TO EXTREMITY
NO SOONER HAD THIS MINISTER ARRIVED IN MADRID THAN SOME OF THE BANISHED ROYALISTS INFLAMED BY THAT INVETERATE HATRED WHICH ANIMATED THE ENGLISH FACTIONS BROKE INTO HIS CHAMBER AND MURDERED HIM TOGETHER WITH HIS SECRETARY
WOULD NOT HE HAVE PUT SIR GEORGE RIGHT IN SO MATERIAL AND INTERESTING A FACT FOOTNOTE 7
AND SO LEGITIMATE AN AFFECTION AVOWED BY THE LAWS OF GOD AND MAN MAY PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TOWARDS A WOMAN OF BEAUTY AND SPIRIT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A PAPIST CLARENDON VOL
THE COMMITTEES TO WHOM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF REVENUE WAS INTRUSTED NEVER BROUGHT IN THEIR ACCOUNTS AND HAD UNLIMITED POWER OF SECRETING WHATEVER SUMS THEY PLEASED FROM THE PUBLIC TREASURE THESE BRANCHES WERE NEEDLESSLY MULTIPLIED IN ORDER TO RENDER THE REVENUE MORE INTRICATE TO SHARE THE ADVANTAGES AMONG GREATER NUMBERS AND TO CONCEAL THE FRAUDS OF WHICH THEY WERE UNIVERSALLY SUSPECTED THE METHOD OF KEEPING ACCOUNTS PRACTISED IN THE EXCHEQUER WAS CONFESSEDLY THE EXACTEST THE MOST ANCIENT THE BEST KNOWN AND THE LEAST LIABLE TO FRAUD
IN THE CULTIVATION OF POLITE LETTERS AND CIVILIZED SOCIETY
CROMWELL IN A RAGE IMMEDIATELY HASTENED TO THE HOUSE AND CARRIED A BODY OF THREE HUNDRED SOLDIERS ALONG WITH HIM
THE KING WAS REQUIRED TO ATTAINT AND EXCEPT FROM A GENERAL PARDON FORTY OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OF HIS ENGLISH SUBJECTS AND NINETEEN OF HIS SCOTTISH TOGETHER WITH ALL POPISH RECUSANTS IN BOTH KINGDOMS WHO HAD BORNE ARMS FOR HIM
FOR HE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO WEEPING AND COULD AT ANY TIME SHED ABUNDANCE OF TEARS
THE DISTANT PARTS OF THE KINGDOM BEING REMOVED FROM THAT FURIOUS VORTEX OF NEW PRINCIPLES AND OPINIONS WHICH HAD TRANSPORTED THE CAPITAL STILL RETAINED A SINCERE REGARD FOR THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY
HE THREW NOT HOWEVER THE BLAME UPON THE PARLIAMENT BUT WAS MORE INCLINED TO THINK THAT ILL INSTRUMENTS HAD INTERPOSED AND RAISED IN THEM FEARS AND JEALOUSIES WITH REGARD TO HIS INTENTIONS
THE MAJORITY OF THE PEERS ADHERED TO THE KING AND PLAINLY FORESAW THE DEPRESSION OF NOBILITY AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF POPULAR USURPATIONS ON THE CROWN
BUT IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THOUGH THE MILITARY PROFESSION REQUIRES GREAT GENIUS AND LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE PRINCIPAL COMMANDERS ALL ITS SUBORDINATE DUTIES MAY BE DISCHARGED BY ORDINARY TALENTS AND FROM SUPERFICIAL PRACTICE
THIS INDEED TEEMS THE KEY TO MOST OF THE CELEBRATED CHARACTERS OF THAT AGE
I AM WELL ASSURED OF MY RECOVERY
TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCE NOW APPEARED NECESSARY
AN EMINENT PERSONAGE HOWEVER HE WAS IN MANY RESPECTS AND EVEN A SUPERIOR GENIUS
WITH A GREAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT VIEWS
FROM THIS MEASURE IT WAS EASILY FORESEEN THAT BESIDES GRATIFYING THE ANIMOSITY OF THE DOCTRINAL PURITANS BOTH THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND THOSE IN POLITICS WOULD REAP CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES
AND FAIRFAX AS FAR AS IT LAY IN HIS POWER WAS VERY EXACT IN OBSERVING THEM

NOTE Y P
THAT THESE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT WERE DERIVED FROM THE UNIFORM TENOR OF THE ENGLISH LAWS IT WOULD BE RASH TO AFFIRM
AND EVERY METHOD OF LIMITING THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN AND DETACHING THEMSELVES FROM THE KING OF ENGLAND WAS GREEDILY ADOPTED AND PURSUED
IF PUBLIC NECESSITY REQUIRED THIS SUPPLY IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT ALSO TO REQUIRE THE KING'S COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE CONDITIONS WHICH WERE THE PRICE OF OBTAINING IT
SIR WILLIAM MIDDLETON JOINED BOOTH WITH SOME TROOPS FROM NORTH WALES
THIS ADVANTAGE WAS TEMPORARY AND DUE ALONE NOT TO ANY ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN BY THE CROWN BUT TO THE SPIRIT OF THE ENGLISH THE REMAINS OF THEIR ANCIENT FREEDOM
TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY
810
HAMBDEN HOWEVER OBTAINED BY THE TRIAL THE END FOR WHICH HE HAD SO GENEROUSLY SACRIFICED HIS SAFETY AND HIS QUIET
MILD AND EQUABLE HE ROSE INTO NO PASSION AT THAT UNUSUAL AUTHORITY WHICH WAS ASSUMED OVER HIM
TO SHOW THEIR REGARD FOR HIS MERIT AND SERVICES THEY BESTOWED AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR ON HIS FAMILY AND HONORED HIM WITH A MAGNIFICENT FUNERAL AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE
LORD CAPEL FEARLESS OF DANGER REPROACHED IRETON WITH IT
IN HIS OWN PERSON HE IS REPRESENTED TO HAVE BEEN A MAN OF VIRTUE
371
AND IT WAS AGREED THAT BURYING FORMER ENMITIES IN OBLIVION ALL EFFORTS SHOULD BE USED FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE RUMP
AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES WHICH INCREASED THEIR OWN IMPORTANCE AND CONSIDERATION
137 ETC
UPON REFLECTION IT SEEMED NOT IMPRACTICABLE THAT A COMBINATION MIGHT BE FORMED BETWEEN THE LORDS AND CITIZENS

THE TRUE GENUINE COVENANT SHE SAID WAS RATIFIED IN HEAVEN
SIR JOHN LAMBE URGING HIM TO PROSECUTE THE PURITANS THE PRELATE ASKED WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THESE SAME PURITANS WERE
AS LONG AS JAMES LIVED BRISTOL SECURE OF THE CONCEALED FAVOR OF THAT MONARCH HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE
AND HE AGREED THAT NO MEMBERS OF EITHER HOUSE SHOULD BE EXCLUDED BUT BY THE CONSENT OF THAT HOUSE OF WHICH THEY WERE MEMBERS
THE PARLIAMENT ALARMED AT THE DANGER IMMEDIATELY CASHIERED LAMBERT DESBOROW BERRY CLARKE BARROW KELSEY COBBET
BUT THESE PRINCIPLES HAVING MET WITH OPPOSITION FROM ARMINIUS AND HIS SECTARIES THE CONTROVERSY WAS SOON BROUGHT INTO THIS ISLAND AND BEGAN HERE TO DIFFUSE ITSELF
AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION
PHILIP IV
THOUGH THE EPISCOPAL CLERGY IN ENGLAND DURING THAT AGE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN AS THEY ARE AT PRESENT SUFFICIENTLY LEARNED AND EXEMPLARY
FLEETWOOD WAS OF THE FORMER SPECIES
AND IF THESE COULD ONCE BE CENSURED AND BE EXPELLED THE CHURCH AND COURT IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE HIERARCHY WOULD RECEIVE A MORTAL BLOW THE CEREMONIES BE LESS RIGIDLY INSISTED ON AND THE KING DEPRIVED OF HIS MOST FAITHFUL FRIENDS BE OBLIGED TO ABATE THOSE HIGH CLAIMS OF PREROGATIVE ON WHICH AT PRESENT HE INSISTED
SCOTLAND SHOWED A LIKE COMPLIANCE
AND LEFT A NOTE IN HIS STUDY WHEREIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS GONE BEYOND CANTERBURY THESE PROSECUTIONS OF WILLIAMS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST INIQUITOUS MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COURT DURING THE TIME THAT THE USE OF PARLIAMENTS WAS SUSPENDED
THESE PROPOSALS THE COMMISSIONERS AFTER PASSING SOME TIME IN SERMONS AND PRAYERS IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THE MORE DETERMINED RESOLUTION VERY SOLEMNLY DELIVERED TO THE KING
BUT THAT HE SENSIBLE OF HIS DUTY HAD STILL TOLD THE PETITIONERS THAT THE PARLIAMENT ITSELF WHICH WAS NOW FREE AND WOULD SOON BE FULL WAS THE BEST JUDGE OF ALL THESE MEASURES
THE OFFICERS INSISTED ON THEIR ADVICE
THOUGH MEN ASTONISHED WITH THE SUCCESSES OF THE ARMY REMAINED IN SEEMING TRANQUILLITY SYMPTOMS OF THE GREATEST DISCONTENT EVERY WHERE APPEARED
641
FORCED LOANS BENEVOLENCES TAXES WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT ARBITRARY IMPRISONMENTS THE BILLETING OF SOLDIERS MARTIAL LAW
KING JAMES'S MEMOIRS
1275
AND EVERY ERROR RENDERED UNPARDONABLE BY THIS IMPUTATION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPLY THE HEIGHT OF ALL ENORMITIES
BY THE IMPRISONMENT OF GENTLEMEN FOR REFUSING THE LOAN WHO IF THEY HAD DONE THE CONTRARY FOR FEAR HAD BEEN AS BLAMABLE AS THE PROJECTOR OF THAT OPPRESSIVE MEASURE
LORD BROKE WAS A ZEALOUS PURITAN
ESSEX'S HORSE WERE SEVERAL TIMES BROKEN BY THE KING'S BUT HIS INFANTRY MAINTAINED THEMSELVES IN FIRM ARRAY
THE COUNTY OF YORK LEVIED A GUARD FOR THE KING OF SIX HUNDRED MEN
BY A MOST USEFUL AND BENEFICIAL LAW THE IMPROPRIATIONS HAD ALREADY BEEN RAVISHED FROM THE GREAT MEN
AND THESE LOANS THEY HAD REPAID AFTERWARDS BY TAXES LEVIED UPON THE PEOPLE
WHEN I WILLINGLY FAIL IN THESE PARTICULARS I SHALL EXPECT NO AID OR RELIEF FROM MAN NOR ANY PROTECTION FROM ABOVE
NOR IS IT EASY TO SEE HOW THE VARIOUS FACTIONS COULD AT THAT TIME HAVE BEEN RESTRAINED WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF MILITARY AND ARBITRARY AUTHORITY
LORD DIGBY WHO HAD ATTEMPTED WITH ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED HORSE TO BREAK INTO SCOTLAND AND JOIN MONTROSE WAS DEFEATED AT SHERBURNE IN YORKSHIRE BY COLONEL COPLEY
AND HE EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT WHATEVER ILL SUCCESS HIS FORMER GUILT MIGHT HAVE DRAWN UPON HIS CAUSE YET NOW HAVING OBTAINED MERCY TO BE ON GOD'S SIDE AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS OWN CAUSE SUBORDINATE TO THAT OF GOD DIVINE PROVIDENCE WOULD CROWN HIS ARMS WITH VICTORY
THE VALOR OF THE ENGLISH WAS MUCH REMARKED ON THIS OCCASION
695
MAY BOOK 11
THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE
BUT CHARLES BESIDES A VIEW OF THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES WHICH MUST RESULT FROM A COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS WAS STRONGLY DETERMINED FROM PRINCIPLES OF PIETY AND CONSCIENCE TO OPPOSE THEM
A SIMPLE AFFIRMATIVE WAS OR SEEMED TO BE EXTORTED FROM HIM
AND HE NEVER COULD MOULD HIS DEPORTMENT INTO THAT STARCHED GRIMACE WHICH THE COVENANTERS REQUIRED AS AN INFALLIBLE MARK OF CONVERSION
PRINCE RUPERT NEGLIGENT OF THE PEOPLE FOND OF THE SOLDIERY HAD INDULGED THE TROOPS IN UNWARRANTABLE LIBERTIES
AND BEING FOUNDED ON SUPPOSED INSPIRATION NOT ON ANY PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN REASON HAD NO MEANS BESIDES CANT AND LOW RHETORIC BY WHICH IT COULD RECOMMEND ITSELF TO OTHERS
THE OTHER PERSONS IN WHOM HE PLACED CONFIDENCE WERE MORE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS REFINED PLEASURES THAN QUALIFIED FOR THE BUSINESS WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK
THE COMMITTEE OF DANGER IN APRIL 1648 VOTED TO RAISE THE ARMY TO FORTY THOUSAND MEN THE SAME YEAR THE PAY OF THE ARMY WAS ESTIMATED AT EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS A MONTH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ARMY IN 1652 WAS IN SCOTLAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOOT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HORSE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DRAGOONS
SHOULD ANY ONE HAVE VOLUNTARILY PROPOSED SAID CROMWELL IN THE HOUSE TO BRING THE KING TO PUNISHMENT I SHOULD HAVE REGARDED HIM AS THE GREATEST TRAITOR
AND THAT HIS PRACTICE IN LONDON DIMINISHED EXTREMELY FROM THE REPROACH DRAWN UPON HIM BY THAT GREAT AND SIGNAL DISCOVERY
BUT IS IT NOT PLAIN THAT THE KING NEVER INTENDED TO RAISE WAR IN ENGLAND
A GREAT BOOTY WAS TAKEN AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM
AND GREAT ALARMS SEIZED THE NATION AND PARLIAMENT A UNIVERSAL CONSPIRACY OF THE PAPISTS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE
AND WHILE EVERY ONE AFFECTED ASTONISHMENT AT THE ENTERPRISE CROMWELL BY WHOSE COUNSEL IT HAD BEEN DIRECTED ARRIVED FROM LONDON AND PUT AN END TO THEIR DELIBERATIONS
DID NOT WE DO SO TOO
BUT IF THE ADJOURNMENT BE BY THE HOUSE THEN THE COMMITTEES AND OTHER MATTERS DO CONTINUE
THE KING'S REVENUE HAD BEEN SEIZED FROM THE BEGINNING BY THE PARLIAMENT WHO ISSUED OUT TO HIM FROM TIME TO TIME SMALL SUMS FOR HIS PRESENT SUBSISTENCE
THE CHARGE WAS BEGUN WITH HIS USUAL CELERITY AND USUAL SUCCESS BY PRINCE RUPERT
THE DEFECT WAS SUPPLIED BY THOSE VIGILANT PATRIOTS WHO NOW ASSUMED THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT
ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM WERE MERE PRETENCES
WHEN HE CAME TO EDINBURGH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF ELABORATE RAGE AND INSULT WAS PUT IN PRACTICE BY ORDER OF THE PARLIAMENT

PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
AND HAVING MODELLED THEIR OWN CHURCH ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PRINCIPLES TO LEAVE THEIR NEIGHBORS IN THE LIKE LIBERTY AND NOT TO INTERMEDDLE WITH AFFAIRS OF WHICH THEY COULD NOT BE SUPPOSED COMPETENT JUDGES RUSH
BUSHWORTH VOL
THE ELECTING OF A DISCONTENTED PARLIAMENT IS A PROOF OF A DISCONTENTED NATION
THEY NOW PRACTISED AGAINST THEIR OFFICERS THE SAME LESSON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT
THEY ORDERED CHARLES IMMEDIATELY TO LEAVE THE CAMP
THE PRESENT GENERALS THEY THOUGHT WERE MORE DESIROUS OF PROTRACTING THAN FINISHING THE WAR
HIGH COURTS OF JUSTICE WERE ERECTED TO TRY THOSE WHO HAD ENGAGED IN CONSPIRACIES AND INSURRECTIONS AGAINST THE PROTECTOR'S AUTHORITY AND WHOM HE COULD NOT SAFELY COMMIT TO THE VERDICT OF JURIES
A PREROGATIVE IT MUST BE OWNED NOT VERY COMPATIBLE WITH A LIMITED MONARCHY
THEY MET NOT HOWEVER WITH A FAVORABLE RECEPTION
179
NOR WOULD THEY OWN HIM OR HIS INTEREST OTHERWISE THAN WITH A SUBORDINATION TO GOD AND SO FAR AS HE OWNED AND PROSECUTED THE CAUSE OF GOD AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE SINS OF HIS HOUSE AND OF HIS FORMER WAYS THE KING LYING ENTIRELY AT MERCY AND HAVING NO ASSURANCE OF LIFE OR LIBERTY FURTHER THAN WAS AGREEABLE TO THE FANCY OF THESE AUSTERE ZEALOTS WAS CONSTRAINED TO EMBRACE A MEASURE WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HIS AFFAIRS AND HIS GREAT YOUTH AND INEXPERIENCE COULD EXCUSE
HE INTRUSTED HIMSELF TO COLONE WINDHAM OF DORSETSHIRE AN AFFECTIONATE PARTISAN OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
AT LEAST GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ADVANCING NEW PRETENSIONS OF A LIKE NATURE IN HOPES OF RESIGNING THEM ON LIKE ADVANTAGEOUS CONDITIONS
WHEN HE WAS PREPARING HIMSELF FOR THE BLOCK BISHOP JUXON CALLED TO HIM
AND THOUGH SOME VIOLATIONS OF THE PETITION OF RIGHT MAY PERHAPS BE IMPUTED TO HIM THESE ARE MORE TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION AND TO THE LOFTY IDEAS OF ROYAL PREROGATIVE WHICH FROM FORMER ESTABLISHED PRECEDENTS HE HAD IMBIBED THAN TO ANY FAILURE IN THE INTEGRITY OF HIS PRINCIPLES 20 SEE NOTE T AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE INDEPENDENTS KEPT PACE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS
CLARENDON VOL II P
AND HAVING ENTERTAINED A SCHEME FOR PRESERVING STILL SOME BALANCE IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY WERE AFRAID OF ENTIRELY SUBDUING THE KING AND REDUCING HIM TO A CONDITION WHERE HE SHOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO ASK ANY CONCESSIONS
AND THOUGH IT WAS JUSTLY APPREHENDED THAT SUCH PRECEDENTS IF PATIENTLY SUBMITTED TO WOULD END IN A TOTAL DISUSE OF PARLIAMENTS AND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ARBITRARY AUTHORITY CHARLES DREADED NO OPPOSITION FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMMONLY MUCH AFFECTED WITH CONSEQUENCES AND REQUIRE SOME STRIKING MOTIVE TO ENGAGE THEM IN A RESISTANCE OF ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
SINCE IT WAS EVIDENTLY NECESSARY FOR THE SECURITY OF PUBLIC PEACE TO SUPPLY HIM WITH MONEY IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS THE SCOTTISH REBELLION
THE REST OF THE SPEECH MAY BE SEEN AMONG MILTON'S STATE PAPERS P
THE LEVELLERS AND AGITATORS HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED BY CROMWELL TO INTERPOSE WITH THEIR ADVICE IN ALL POLITICAL DELIBERATIONS
BY DECLAIMING AGAINST THE SUPPOSED ENCROACHMENTS AND TYRANNY OF THE PRELATES THEY ENDEAVORED TO CARRY THE NATION FROM A HATRED OF THEIR PERSONS TO AN OPPOSITION AGAINST THEIR OFFICE AND CHARACTER
SEVERAL SEDUCED OFFICERS AND YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE INNS OF COURT DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING
THAT THE SCOTS HAVING SO SUCCESSFULLY THROWN OFF DEPENDENCE ON THE CROWN OF ENGLAND AND ASSUMED THE GOVERNMENT INTO THEIR OWN HANDS HAD SET AN EXAMPLE TO THE IRISH WHO HAD SO MUCH GREATER OPPRESSIONS TO COMPLAIN OF
HAVING ASSOCIATED IN THEIR CAUSE THE COUNTIES OF HERTFORD ESSEX CAMBRIDGE NORFOLK SUFFOLK LINCOLN AND HUNTINGDON THEY GAVE THE EARL OF MANCHESTER A COMMISSION TO BE GENERAL OF THE ASSOCIATION AND APPOINTED AN ARMY TO BE LEVIED UNDER HIS COMMAND
IT HAPPENED THAT DAY TO BE FULLER THAN USUAL AND THEY WERE ASSEMBLED TO THE NUMBER OF SIXTEEN
FOR LIKE REASONS THE PARLIAMENT PRUDENTLY AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL ADVANCES TOWARDS NEGOTIATION AND WERE CAUTIOUS NOT TO EXPOSE TOO EASILY TO CENSURE THOSE HIGH TERMS WHICH THEIR APPREHENSIONS OR THEIR AMBITION MADE THEM PREVIOUSLY DEMAND OF THE KING
AND AMONG THESE AS BEING MORE UNCULTIVATED AND UNCIVILIZED SEEMED RATHER TO BE INFLAMED INTO A HIGHER DEGREE OF FEROCITY
BUT THE VIEWS OF THE KING WERE AT THIS TIME SO REPUGNANT TO THOSE OF THE PURITANS THAT THE LEADERS WHOM HE GAINED LOST FROM THAT MOMENT ALL INTEREST WITH THEIR PARTY AND WERE EVEN PURSUED AS TRAITORS WITH IMPLACABLE HATRED AND RESENTMENT
THE INFAMY OF THIS BARGAIN HAD SUCH AN INFLUENCE ON THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT THAT THEY ONCE VOTED THAT THE KING SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND HIS LIBERTY INSISTED ON
THE COMMONS FROM POLICY RATHER THAN NECESSITY HAD EMBRACED THE EXPEDIENT OF PAYING THE TWO ARMIES BY BORROWING MONEY FROM THE CITY
IN OTHERS IT WAS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED
BUT MADE NO DECLARATIONS TILL THEY SHOULD SEE THE TURN WHICH AFFAIRS TOOK IN ENGLAND
HIS BROTHER LANERIC WHO WAS ALSO PUT UNDER CONFINEMENT FOUND MEANS TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE AND TO FLY INTO SCOTLAND
AND THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL HAVING EMBRACED THE PARTY OF THE PARLIAMENT HAD APPOINTED AT THEIR DESIRE THE EARL OF WARWICK TO BE HIS LIEUTENANT
BUT AS A TREATY WITH A PEOPLE SO ODIOUS FOR THEIR BARBARITIES AND STILL MORE FOR THEIR RELIGION MIGHT BE REPRESENTED IN INVIDIOUS COLORS AND RENEW ALL THOSE CALUMNIES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED WITH GREAT CAUTION IN CONDUCTING THAT MEASURE
AND REPROACHED THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR PROFANE TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE CAPITAL ENEMY OF PIETY AND RELIGION
A BILL OF ATTAINDER WAS THEREFORE BROUGHT INTO THE LOWER HOUSE IMMEDIATELY AFTER FINISHING THESE PLEADINGS

THE POWER OF IMPRISONMENT THEREFORE BEING THE MOST NATURAL AND POTENT ENGINE OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO REMOVE IT FROM A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS FREE AND LEGAL
AND THE COURTIERS WHO STUDIED HIS LOOKS CONCLUDED THAT SECRETLY HE WAS NOT DISPLEASED TO BE RID OF A MINISTER SO GENERALLY ODIOUS TO THE NATION CLARENDON VOL
GUMBLE'S LIFE OF MONK P
BUT AS THEY PREACHED UNIVERSAL PEACE THEY SEDUCED THE MILITARY ZEALOTS FROM THEIR PROFESSION AND WOULD SOON HAD THEY BEEN SUFFERED HAVE PUT AN END WITHOUT ANY DEFEAT OR CALAMITY TO THE DOMINION OF THE SAINTS
SO FAR FROM BEING SORRY THAT MY QUARTERS ARE TO BE SENT TO FOUR CITIES OF THE KINGDOM I WISH I HAD LIMBS ENOW TO BE DISPERSED INTO ALL THE CITIES OF CHRISTENDOM THERE TO REMAIN AS TESTIMONIES IN FAVOR OF THE CAUSE FOR WHICH I SUFFER THIS SENTIMENT THAT VERY EVENING WHILE IN PRISON HE THREW INTO VERSE
WHY SURELY IT IS NOT TO BE OBJECTED TO A MAN
CHARLES HAVING PASSED SOME TIME AT PARIS WHERE NO ASSISTANCE WAS GIVEN HIM AND EVEN FEW CIVILITIES WERE PAID HIM MADE HIS RETREAT INTO JERSEY WHERE HIS AUTHORITY WAS STILL ACKNOWLEDGED
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT THE LEAST REMARKABLE OF ALL THOSE WHICH ATTEND THAT GREAT GENIUS
AND THE KING WHEN HE ARRIVED AT WORCESTER FOUND THAT HIS FORCES EXTREMELY HARASSED BY A HASTY AND FATIGUING MARCH WERE NOT MORE NUMEROUS THAN WHEN HE ROSE FROM HIS CAMP IN THE TORWOOD
THE WHOLE FRAME OF THE IRISH UNION BEING IN A MANNER DISSOLVED ORMOND SOON AFTER LEFT THE ISLAND AND DELEGATED HIS AUTHORITY TO CLANRICARDE WHO FOUND AFFAIRS SO DESPERATE AS TO ADMIT OF NO REMEDY
FELTON SMILED AND TOLD THEM THAT THE DUKE HE KNEW FULL WELL HAD RECEIVED A BLOW WHICH HAD TERMINATED ALL THEIR HOPES
ARCHBISHOP LAUD THE MOST FAVORED MINISTER OF THE KING WAS BROUGHT TO THE SCAFFOLD
THERE WAS IN SCOTLAND ANOTHER PARTY WHO PROFESSING EQUAL ATTACHMENT TO THE KING'S SERVICE PRETENDED ONLY TO DIFFER WITH MONTROSE ABOUT THE MEANS OF ATTAINING THE SAME END
562
562
AND A COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS WAS APPOINTED TO REPROVE HIM FOR A BEHAVIOR SO UNBECOMING A COVENANTED MONARCH
BY WHICH SUITABLY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE PURITANS THE UTMOST LIBERTY BOTH IN PRAYING AND PREACHING WAS INDULGED TO THE PUBLIC TEACHERS
TO HAVE KEPT THEM IN OBEDIENCE HAD BEEN THE MORE DIFFICULT ENTERPRISE
OPPOSITION TO THE RIGID PRECISENESS OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS INCREASED THEIR INCLINATION TO GOOD FELLOW-SHIP
THE PEERS WERE SENSIBLE OF THE KING'S URGENT NECESSITIES

THE EARLS OF WARWICK AND DENBIGH SIR PHILIP STAPLETON SIR WILLIAM WALLER HOLLIS MASSEY WHITLOCKE MAYNARD GLYN HAD EMBRACED THE SAME SENTIMENTS
THIS CONCESSION WHICH PROBABLY AROSE FROM THE KING'S MODERATE TEMPER NOW FREED FROM THE IMPULSE OF BUCKINGHAM'S VIOLENT COUNSELS MIGHT HAVE SATISFIED THE COMMONS HAD THEY ENTERTAINED NO OTHER VIEW THAN THAT OF ASCERTAINING THEIR OWN POWERS AND PRIVILEGES
WHO BEARS WITNESS AGAINST YOU SAID DORSET
THE ENGLISH WERE NOT SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
IT WAS IN SOME MEASURE OWING TO HIS POPULARITY THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN ENABLED TO LEVY AN ARMY OR MAKE HEAD AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE
AND AS SO COMPLICATED AND JEALOUS A GOVERNMENT AS THE ENGLISH CANNOT SUBSIST WITHOUT MANY SUCH REFINEMENTS IT IS EASY TO SEE HOW FAVORABLE EVERY INACCURACY MUST FORMERLY HAVE PROVED TO ROYAL AUTHORITY WHICH ON ALL EMERGENCIES WAS OBLIGED TO SUPPLY BY DISCRETIONARY POWER THE GREAT DEFICIENCY OF THE LAWS
NALSON VOL II

AND BEING EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE WHICH CONDEMNED THE LATE KING HE HAD RISEN TO GREAT CREDIT AND FAVOR WITH THE RULING PARTY
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY EXCEPT A SMALL PART WHERE THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY STILL ADHERED TO THE KING BEING IN THE HANDS OF THE COVENANTERS WAS IN A VERY LITTLE TIME PUT IN A TOLERABLE POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE FORTIFICATIONS OF LEITH WERE BEGUN AND CARRIED ON WITH GREAT RAPIDITY
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE KINGDOM LORD BROKE WAS KILLED BY A SHOT WHILE HE WAS TAKING POSSESSION OF LICHFIELD FOR THE PARLIAMENT AFTER A SHARP COMBAT NEAR STAFFORD BETWEEN THE EARL OF NORTHAMPTON AND SIR JOHN GELL THE FORMER WHO COMMANDED THE KING'S FORCES WAS KILLED WHILE HE FOUGHT WITH GREAT VALOR
232 256
AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A NAVY MUST BE BUILT AND EQUIPPED AT LEISURE DURING PEACE
A HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE WAS ANEW ERECTED FOR THE TRIAL OF THOSE CRIMINALS WHOSE GUILT WAS MOST APPARENT
YOU SAY YOU HAVE NOT SO LEARNED CHRIST AS TO HANG THE EQUITY OF YOUR CAUSE UPON EVENTS
AND IT WAS THE PROVINCE OF THE PEERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH A COMPLICATION OF ENORMOUS CRIMES IN ONE PERSON DID NOT AMOUNT TO THE HIGHEST CRIME KNOWN BY THE LAW WITHOUT FURTHER DEBATE THE IMPEACHMENT WAS VOTED
IF THERE HAD BEEN BUT TWO BESIDES MYSELF OF MY OPINION I HAD NOT DONE IT
THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND
WHENCE HE WENT TO PARIS WHERE HE JOINED THE QUEEN WHO HAD FLED THITHER FROM EXETER AT THE TIME THE EARL OF ESSEX CONDUCTED THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY TO THE WEST
CROMWELL HAVING RECEIVED A REENFORCEMENT FROM ENGLAND AGAIN TOOK THE FIELD EARLY IN THE SPRING
AND NOT YET THINKING THEMSELVES SAFE THEY DESERTED THAT TOWN END RETREATED INTO YORKSHIRE THE SCOTS TOOK POSSESSION OF NEWCASTLE
THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION WAS DETERMINED TO BE A GRIEVANCE
DR BIRCH HAS WRITTEN A TREATISE ON THIS SUBJECT IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS TO OPPOSE ANY FACTS CONTAINED IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S PERFORMANCE
HIS WORDS ARE AS FOR MY CALLING THOSE AT LONDON A PARLIAMENT I SHALL REFER THEE TO DIGBY FOR PARTICULAR SATISFACTION
THE WHOLE HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A SPLENDID COURT RATHER THAN OF A MILITARY ARMAMENT
THE END ON WHICH THE KING WAS MOST INTENT IN CHANGING MINISTERS WAS TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE EARL OF STRAFFORD AND TO MOLLIFY BY THESE INDULGENCES THE RAGE OF HIS MOST FURIOUS PROSECUTORS
SIR JOHN ELLIOT FRAMED A REMONSTRANCE AGAINST LEVYING TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT AND OFFERED IT TO THE CLERK TO READ
AND HE EXTREMELY APPLAUDED THE BENIGNITY WHICH DISPLAYED ITSELF IN THE WHOLE DISPOSITION AND BEHAVIOR OF CHARLES
70

70
AND HE FORESAW THAT IF THE MONARCHY WERE RESTORED HEREDITARY RIGHT WOULD ALSO BE ESTABLISHED AND THE CROWN BE TRANSMITTED TO THE POSTERITY OF THE PRINCE FIRST ELECTED
AND THEIR OTHER PROVISIONS WERE IN THE SAME PROPORTION
REVELATIONS THEY SAID WERE MADE THEM THAT THE SECTARIAN AND HERETICAL ARMY TOGETHER WITH AGAG MEANING CROMWELL WAS DELIVERED INTO THEIR HANDS
THE COVENANTERS FOUND THEMSELVES SECONDED BY THE ZEAL OF THE WHOLE NATION
THE LETTER WHOSE POSTSCRIPT IS MENTIONED BY THE KING IS TO BE FOUND IN CARTE VOL
300
THEY ADMITTED A FEW OF THE EXCLUDED AND ABSENT MEMBERS SUCH AS WERE LIABLE TO LEAST EXCEPTION
THAT AMONG MANY PERSONS OF GREATER WORTH WHO BORE THEIR COMMISSION HE HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AS THE INSTRUMENT OF PROVIDENCE FOR EFFECTING THEIR RESTORATION
BARBADOES COMMANDED BY LORD WILLOUGHBY OF PARHAM MADE SOME RESISTANCE
ALL THE TORTURES WHICH WANTON CRUELTY COULD DEVISE ALL THE LINGERING PAINS OF BODY THE ANGUISH OF MIND THE AGONIES OF DESPAIR COULD NOT SATIATE REVENGE EXCITED WITHOUT INJURY AND CRUELTY DERIVED FROM NO CAUSE
HAZELRIG AND MORLEY HEARING OF THIS IMPORTANT EVENT LEFT PORTSMOUTH AND ADVANCED TOWARDS LONDON
THE PRESBYTERIANS WHO HAD CHIEFLY SUPPORTED THE WAR WERE ENRAGED TO FIND THE PRIZE JUST WHEN IT SEEMED WITHIN THEIR REACH SNATCHED BY VIOLENCE FROM THEM
WHO WITH A MIXTURE OF FAMILIARITY AND AFFECTION USUALLY CALLED HIM HONEST GEORGE MONK AN HONORABLE APPELLATION WHICH THEY STILL CONTINUED TO HIM EVEN DURING HIS GREATEST ELEVATION
THE DUTCH WERE CONTENT TO PAY THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS FOR A LICENSE DURING THIS YEAR
WHITHER SAID THE KING
AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT WHAT IS JUSTIFIABLE AND APPROVED BY THE HOUSE LEST THE PEOPLE MIGHT BE AVERSE TO THE SECONDING OF ALL THESE USURPATIONS THEY WERE PLIED ANEW WITH RUMORS OF DANGER WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS
PRYNNE HIMSELF WAS TRIED FOR A NEW OFFENCE
PAPISTS AND ARMINIANS WERE THERE DECLARED CAPITAL ENEMIES TO THE COMMONWEALTH
THE SCAFFOLD HAD OFTEN STREAMED WITH THE BLOOD OF THE MORE ACTIVE ROYALISTS
AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES
BY MEANS OF SHIP MONEY AN IMPOSITION WHICH HAD BEEN SO MUCH COMPLAINED OF AND IN SOME RESPECTS WITH REASON THE LATE KING HAD PUT THE NAVY INTO A SITUATION WHICH IT HAD NEVER ATTAINED IN ANY FORMER REIGN
HE HASTENED TO TREDAH
IT PASSED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WAS SENT TO THE UPPER HOUSE
THE ILLEGAL CONFINEMENT OF MEN FOR NOT OBEYING ILLEGAL COMMANDS
IT MAY BE EXPECTED THAT WE SHOULD HERE MENTION THE ICON BASILIKE A WORK PUBLISHED IN THE KING'S NAME A FEW DAYS AFTER HIS EXECUTION
ALL ECCLESIASTICAL AFFAIRS WERE SETTLED BY LAW AND UNINTERRUPTED PRECEDENT
1 2
THROUGHOUT THE WINTER CONTINUAL EFFORTS HAD EVERY WHERE BEEN MADE BY EACH PARTY TO SURMOUNT ITS ANTAGONIST
A LETTER WAS BROUGHT HIM WRITTEN BY GORING TO THE KING AND UNFORTUNATELY INTRUSTED TO A SPY OF FAIRFAX'S
1646 THE SAME RAPID AND UNINTERRUPTED SUCCESS ATTENDED FAIRFAX
THESE DISCONTENTS CHARLES INFLAMED BY HIS AFFECTATION OF A SEVERITY WHICH HE HAD NOT POWER NOR PROBABLY INCLINATION TO CARRY TO EXTREMITIES
BE FAITHFUL JOINER OF BRITLING
JOYCE POINTED TO THE SOLDIERS WHOM HE BROUGHT ALONG
WALLER ORDERED A CONSIDERABLE DETACHMENT TO PASS THE BRIDGE WITH AN INTENTION OF FALLING ON THE REAR OF THE ROYALISTS
998
WHO BORE A MUCH GREATER KINDNESS TO THE MOTHER CHURCH AS THEY CALLED HER THAN TO THE SECTARIES AND PRESBYTERIANS AND FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED HER AS A TRUE CHRISTIAN CHURCH
75 82
WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS
HIS SON ENDEAVORING HIS RESCUE FELL LIKEWISE INTO THE ENEMY'S HANDS
THIS BOLD ACTION WHICH ITS VERY TEMERITY PERHAPS RENDERED SAFE WAS EXECUTED WITH LITTLE LOSS AND FILLED ALL THAT PART OF THE WORLD WITH THE RENOWN OF ENGLISH VALOR
164
BUT PRINCE RUPERT BY MAKING SOME REPRISALS SOON REPRESSED THIS INHUMANITY WHITLOCKE P 78 103
AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
NO AMUSEMENT WAS ALLOWED HIM NOR SOCIETY WHICH MIGHT RELIEVE HIS ANXIOUS THOUGHTS
AND THE ENGLISH ROUSED FROM THE LETHARGY OF PEACE WITH EAGER THOUGH UNSKILFUL HANDS EMPLOYED AGAINST THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS THEIR LONG-NEGLECTED WEAPONS
IN THIS ADDED HE MY CONSENT WILL MORE ACQUIT YOU TO GOD THAN ALL THE WORLD CAN DO BESIDES
ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HAD NO EFFECT
GUTHREY
AND IN NO FORMER AGE WOULD THE PEOPLE HAVE ENTERTAINED ANY SCRUPLE WITH REGARD TO THEM
MARTIAL LAW ABOLISHED

COLONEL EUSEBIUS ANDREWS AND COLONEL WALTER SLINGSBY WERE TRIED BY THIS COURT FOR CONSPIRACIES AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH
YET THE JUDGES BY HIS DIRECTION WENT NO FURTHER THAN TO REMAND THE GENTLEMEN TO PRISON AND REFUSE THE BAIL WHICH WAS OFFERED HEATHE THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL INSISTED THAT THE COURT IN IMITATION OF THE JUDGES IN THE THIRTY-FOURTH OF ELIZABETH SHOULD ENTER A GENERAL JUDGMENT THAT NO BAIL COULD BE GRANTED UPON A COMMITMENT BY THE KING OR COUNCIL BUT THE JUDGES WISELY DECLINED COMPLYING
314
AT THE SAME TIME THE COUNCIL OF THE ARMY ORDERED A GENERAL RENDEZVOUS OF ALL THE REGIMENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR COMMON INTERESTS
A COMMISSION HAD LIKEWISE BEEN GRANTED AND SOME MONEY REMITTED IN ORDER TO RAISE A THOUSAND GERMAN HORSE AND TRANSPORT THEM INTO ENGLAND
THE OPPOSITION THEREFORE WHICH THE REMONSTRANCE MET WITH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS GREAT
THE NATION CAUGHT NEW FIRE FROM THE POPULAR LEADERS AND SEEMED NOW TO HAVE MADE THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF THE MANY SUPPOSED DISORDERS IN THE GOVERNMENT
THE GOOD SENSE WHICH HE DISPLAYED IN HIS DISCOURSE AND CONVERSATION SEEMED TO WARRANT HIS SUCCESS IN EVERY REASONABLE UNDERTAKING
THOUGH AT OTHER TIMES IT AGREED VERY WELL WITH THEIR STOMACHS
THE KING BEGAN TO FEEL OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE HE WAS
256 346
AFTER THIS VICTORY TROMP IN A BRAVADO FIXED A BROOM TO HIS MAINMAST
WITH REGARD TO THE PEOPLE WE CAN ENTERTAIN NO DOUBT THAT THE CONTROVERSY WAS ON THEIR PART ENTIRELY THEOLOGICAL
AND THEREFORE CONCLUDE TO HAVE A SELECT COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO FRAME A PETITION TO HIS MAJESTY FOR REDRESS OF THESE GRIEVANCES
THE KING APPREHENSIVE OF DANGER FROM THE ENRAGED MULTITUDE HAD RETIRED TO HAMPTON COURT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD AND OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF SHAME AND REMORSE FOR THE FATAL MEASURES INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN HURRIED
LIKE PROPOSALS HAD BEEN REITERATED BY THE KING DURING THE ENSUING CAMPAIGN AND STILL MET WITH A LIKE ANSWER FROM ESSEX CLARENDON VOL
HE SENT ORDERS TO ORMOND IF HE COULD NOT DEFEND HIMSELF RATHER TO SUBMIT TO THE ENGLISH THAN TO THE IRISH REBELS
AND SHOWED HIMSELF A MAN WHO WOULD GO ALL LENGTHS IN FAVOR OF THAT CAUSE WHICH HE HAD ESPOUSED
HAD THE NATION BEEN DISPOSED TO RECEIVE IT OR HAD THE ARMY INTENDED TO IMPOSE IT
THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES
LAUD ALSO HAD UNFORTUNATELY ACQUIRED A GREAT ASCENDANT OVER HIM
BUCKINGHAM'S SOLE GUILT HE THOUGHT WAS THE BEING HIS FRIEND AND FAVORITE RUSHWORTH VOL
BUT SOON DISCOVERED THAT ALL SAVINGS BEING GONE AND GREAT DEBTS CONTRACTED HIS REVENUE WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THEM
THE MANNERS OF THE TWO FACTIONS WERE AS OPPOSITE AS THOSE OF THE MOST DISTANT NATIONS
TROMP FOLLOWED HIM WITH A FLEET OF ABOVE A HUNDRED SAIL
IT WILL IN US BE A WRONG DONE TO OURSELVES TO OUR POSTERITIES TO OUR CONSCIENCES IF WE FOREGO THIS CLAIM AND PRETENSION FRANKLYN P
THAT THE SCOTS HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIM ANY ASSURANCES OF THEIR INTENDING TO RESTORE HIM TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND
THOUGH WE OUGHT NOT TO SUSPECT THE NOBLE HISTORIAN OF EXAGGERATIONS TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF CHARLES'S MEASURES THIS FACT IT MUST BE OWNED APPEARS SOMEWHAT INCREDIBLE
AND WHEN HE COMPARES BOTH SIDES HE WILL BE SOME TIME AT A LOSS TO FIX ANY DETERMINATION
HE ARMED SEVERAL OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE ORKNEYS THOUGH AN UNWARLIKE PEOPLE AND CARRIED THEM OVER WITH HIM TO CAITHNESS
UPON WHICH CONDITION AND CONSTRUCTION I DID IT AND NO OTHERWISE
THE CANONS FOR ESTABLISHING ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION WERE PROMULGATED IN 1635
THE KING IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMISSIONERS OF SCOTLAND SET SAIL FOR THAT COUNTRY
THOUGH HE SECRETLY PROMISED THEM TRUST AND PREFERMENT AS SOON AS HIS ARMY SHOULD ADVANCE INTO ENGLAND
AND THOSE VERY ACTIONS OF WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD BEEN GUILTY THEY DENOMINATED TREASON AND REBELLION WHEN EXECUTED BY AN OPPOSITE PARTY
JUSTICE WAS ADMINISTERED BY SEVEN JUDGES FOUR OF WHOM WERE ENGLISH
SINCE THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF THIS HISTORY THE SEQUEL OF LORD CLARENDON HAS BEEN PUBLISHED
ARGYLE RENEWED HIS COURTSHIP TO THE KING
THE ENGLISH FLEET HAD BEEN SO SHATTERED IN THE FIGHT THAT IT WAS NOT ABLE TO PURSUE
402
402
THEIR UNION WITH THE POPULAR PARTY IN ENGLAND BROUGHT GREAT ACCESSION OF AUTHORITY TO THE LATTER
EVEN A BUTTON TO THE HAT THOUGH SOMETIMES USEFUL YET NOT BEING ALWAYS SO WAS UNIVERSALLY REJECTED BY THEM WITH HORROR AND DETESTATION
IN A LITTLE TIME THE TOWN WAS FOUND TO BE NO LONGER IN A CONDITION OF DEFENCE
AND BOTH SIDES IMMEDIATELY RUSHED INTO THE COMBAT
ALL THE TIME THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND MONTROSE WAS CONFINED IN PRISON
AND WHILE SO GREAT A POWER WAS LODGED IN SUCH ACTIVE HANDS NO WONDER THE REPUBLIC WAS SUCCESSFUL IN ALL ITS ENTERPRISES
AND IN MANAGING IT CONSISTED THE CHIEF ART AND DELICACY OF HIS GOVERNMENT
AS IF THE METHOD OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS HAD HERE BEEN PRESCRIBED TO THEM
ALL OPPOSITION WAS OVERBORNE BY THE FURIOUS VALOR OF THE TROOPS
HE LOST HOWEVER ELEVEN SHIPS OF WAR HAD TWO THOUSAND MEN SLAIN AND NEAR FIFTEEN HUNDRED TAKEN PRISONERS
NO ONE CAN DOUBT OF THIS TRUTH WHO PERUSES ORMOND'S CORRESPONDENCE IN MR CARTE
THE 31ST OF JULY 1645 AFTER THE BATTLE OF NASEBY BEING REDUCED TO GREAT STRAITS HE WRITES EARNESTLY TO ORMOND TO CONCLUDE A PEACE UPON CERTAIN CONDITIONS MENTIONED MUCH INFERIOR TO THOSE GRANTED BY GLAMORGAN
AND THAT YOU MAY REIGN FOREVER WITH JESUS CHRIST THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS THE PRINCIPLES WHICH EXALTED PREROGATIVE WERE NOT ENTERTAINED BY THE KING MERELY AS SOFT AND AGREEABLE TO HIS ROYAL EARS
WHEN INTELLIGENCE OF THE SIEGE OF GLOUCESTER ARRIVED IN LONDON THE CONSTERNATION AMONG THE INHABITANTS WAS AS GREAT AS IF THE ENEMY WERE ALREADY AT THEIR GATES
BESIDES THE CUSTOMS AND EXCISE NINETY THOUSAND POUNDS A MONTH WERE LEVIED ON LAND FOR THE SUBSISTENCE OF THE ARMY
THE BEAUTY OF HIS PERSON THE GRACEFULNESS OF HIS AIR THE SPLENDOR OF HIS EQUIPAGE HIS FINE TASTE IN DRESS FESTIVALS AND CAROUSALS CORRESPONDED TO THE PREPOSSESSIONS ENTERTAINED IN HIS FAVOR
TO CONSIDER HIM IN THE MOST FAVORABLE LIGHT IT MAY BE AFFIRMED THAT HIS DIGNITY WAS FREE FROM PRIDE HIS HUMANITY FROM WEAKNESS HIS BRAVERY FROM RASHNESS HIS TEMPERANCE FROM AUSTERITY HIS FRUGALITY FROM AVARICE
HE WAS NOT BUOYED UP BY GLORY NOR BY THE AFFECTIONATE COMPASSION OF THE SPECTATORS
AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE IRISH INSURRECTION THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT THOUGH THEY UNDERTOOK THE SUPPRESSION OF IT HAD EVER BEEN TOO MUCH ENGAGED EITHER IN MILITARY PROJECTS OR EXPEDITIONS AT HOME TO TAKE ANY EFFECTUAL STEP TOWARDS FINISHING THAT ENTERPRISE

THE OTHER CONDITIONS WERE IN THE MAIN THE SAME WITH THOSE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN OFFERED TO THE KING CHARLES SAID THAT PROPOSALS WHICH INTRODUCED SUCH IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDED TIME FOR DELIBERATION
SOME ENCOURAGEMENT AND PROTECTION WHICH THE KING AND THE BISHOPS GAVE TO WAKES CHURCH ALES BRIDE ALES AND OTHER CHEERFUL FESTIVALS OF THE COMMON PEOPLE WERE THE OBJECTS OF LIKE SCANDAL TO THE PURITANS.[V RUSH
P 784 792
PIERCY WROTE A LETTER TO HIS BROTHER NORTHUMBERLAND CONFESSING MOST OF THE PARTICULARS BOTH THEIR TESTIMONIES AGREE WITH REGARD TO THE OATH OF SECRECY
THE NEWS WHICH HE RECEIVED FROM EVERY QUARTER WERE NO LESS FATAL THAN THOSE EVENTS WHICH PASSED WHERE HE HIMSELF WAS PRESENT
THE COMPOSITIONS WITH CATHOLICS THEY SAID AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN A TOLERATION HATEFUL TO GOD FULL OF DISHONOR AND DISPROFIT TO HIS MAJESTY AND OF EXTREME SCANDAL AND GRIEF TO HIS GOOD PEOPLE
IN THE MEAN TIME NOT ONLY ALL PETITIONS WHICH FAVORED THE CHURCH OR MONARCHY FROM WHATEVER HAND THEY CAME WERE DISCOURAGED BUT THE PETITIONERS WERE SENT FOR IMPRISONED AND PROSECUTED AS DELINQUENTS
38
38
38
38
38
AND DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS THEY NEITHER SENT UP ONE BILL TO THE PROTECTOR NOR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM
THE CHIEF OBJECT OF SCRUTINY REGARDED THEIR ADVANCES IN GRACE AND FIXING THE CRITICAL MOMENT OF THEIR CONVERSION
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
THERE REMAINS A PROCLAMATION OF THIS YEAR PROHIBITING HACKNEY COACHES FROM STANDING IN THE STREET.[V WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE WERE NOT ABOVE TWENTY COACHES OF THAT KIND IN LONDON
BUT OFFERED TO RECALL THESE PROCLAMATIONS PROVIDED THE PARLIAMENT AGREED TO RECALL THEIRS IN WHICH HIS ADHERENTS WERE DECLARED TRAITORS
IN THE COURSE OF HIS EDUCATION HE HAD BEEN SENT TO THE UNIVERSITY
THAT PRECISE SUM WAS REQUIRED WHICH EACH WOULD HAVE PAID HAD THE VOTE OF FOUR SUBSIDIES PASSED INTO A LAW
AND ALL MEN UNITED IN THEIR DETESTATION OF THOSE HYPOCRITICAL PARRICIDES WHO BY SANCTIFIED PRETENCES HAD SO LONG DISGUISED THEIR TREASONS AND IN THIS LAST ACT OF INIQUITY HAD THROWN AN INDELIBLE STAIN UPON THE NATION
AND ON THEIR SWORD CHIEFLY DURING THE CAMPAIGN WERE THESE TO DEPEND FOR SUBSISTENCE
LANGDALE AND MUSGRAVE WERE IN ARMS AND MASTERS OF BERWICK AND CARLISLE IN THE NORTH
85 106
SUCH LOVE OF CONTRADICTION PREVAILED IN THE PARLIAMENT THAT THEY HAD CONVERTED CHRISTMAS WHICH WITH THE CHURCHMEN WAS A GREAT FESTIVAL INTO A SOLEMN FAST AND HUMILIATION
THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE NATION THEY IMAGINED WAS NOW LODGED IN THEIR HANDS
AND THE WORDS OF THE MEN OF JUDAH WERE FIERCER THAN THE WORDS OF THE MEN OF ISRAEL BUT THE KING SOON FOUND THAT THE HAPPINESS CHIEFLY OF THE ALLUSION HAD TEMPTED THE PREACHER TO EMPLOY THIS TEXT AND THAT THE COVENANTING ZEALOTS WERE NOWISE PACIFIED TOWARDS HIM
THE NOBILITY THE GENTRY BENT THEIR PASSIONATE ENDEAVORS TO THE SAME ENTERPRISE BY WHICH ALONE THEY COULD BE REDEEMED FROM SLAVERY
CROMWELL FINDING MATTERS RIPE FOR HIS PURPOSE CALLED A COUNCIL OF OFFICERS IN ORDER TO COME TO A DETERMINATION WITH REGARD TO THE PUBLIC SETTLEMENT
THOUGH THE IRISH IN THESE OTHER PROVINCES PRETENDED TO ACT WITH MODERATION AND HUMANITY
THE ELEVEN IMPEACHED MEMBERS WERE RECALLED AND THE VOTE BY WHICH THEY WERE EXPELLED WAS REVERSED

OF THE SAME PARTY
WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED TO PASS A SENTENCE WHICH MUST TOTALLY SUBDUE THE LOWER HOUSE AND PUT AN END TO THEIR AMBITIOUS UNDERTAKINGS
THIS NOBLEMAN POSSESSED MORE VIGOR OF MIND THAN THE KING OR ANY OF THE COUNCIL
THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING ON REASONABLE TERMS ANY VOLUNTARY SUPPLY FROM PARLIAMENT
308
LUDLOW I THINK IS ALMOST THE ONLY PARLIAMENTARIAN WHO IMPUTES THAT VICE TO HIM
680 788
THE COMMITTEE TOO ON THEIR PART WAS READY TO IMITATE THE EXAMPLE
THE SCOTS WHOSE AUTHORITY NOW RAN EXTREMELY HIGH LOOKED ON HIM AS THE CAPITAL ENEMY OF THEIR COUNTRY AND ONE WHOSE COUNSELS AND INFLUENCE THEY HAD MOST REASON TO APPREHEND
AND IN CASE THAT FOR THE SECURITY OF HIS MAJESTY'S PERSON THE GENERAL SAFETY OF HIS PEOPLE OR THE PEACEABLE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM THE KING SHALL FIND JUST CAUSE FOR REASONS OF STATE TO IMPRISON OR RESTRAIN ANY MAN'S PERSON HE WAS PETITIONED GRACIOUSLY TO DECLARE THAT WITHIN A CONVENIENT TIME HE SHALL AND WILL EXPRESS THE CAUSE OF THE COMMITMENT OR RESTRAINT EITHER GENERAL OR SPECIAL AND UPON A CAUSE SO EXPRESSED WILL LEAVE THE PRISONER IMMEDIATELY TO BE TRIED ACCORDING TO THE COMMON LAW OF THE LAND WHITLOCKE P
BUT CAME TOO LATE
HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT
AND BY MUTUAL CONCERT THE ILLEGAL TAXES BE REFUSED WHICH THE PARLIAMENT WITHOUT THE ROYAL ASSENT IMPOSED ON THE PEOPLE
NATHANIEL FIENNES SON OF LORD SAY HE HIMSELF AS WELL AS HIS FATHER A GREAT PARLIAMENTARY LEADER WAS GOVERNOR AND COMMANDED A GARRISON OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOOT AND TWO REGIMENTS ONE OF HORSE ANOTHER OF DRAGOONS
TWO GALLEONS WERE SET ON FIRE
INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE
ALL THE VIOLENCES PUT ON THE KING THEY LOUDLY BLAMED AS REPUGNANT TO THE COVENANT BY WHICH THEY STOOD ENGAGED TO DEFEND HIS ROYAL PERSON
HUGH PETERS THE MAD CHAPLAIN OF CROMWELL PREACHED FREQUENTLY UPON THIS TEXT
THAT AS HE EXPECTED ONLY SUCH SUPPLY AT PRESENT AS THE CURRENT SERVICE NECESSARILY REQUIRED IT WOULD BE REQUISITE TO ASSEMBLE THEM AGAIN NEXT WINTER WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE FULL LEISURE TO CONCLUDE WHATEVER BUSINESS HAD THIS SESSION BEEN LEFT IMPERFECT AND UNFINISHED
BUT ABOVE ALL BRANCHES OF PREROGATIVE THAT WHICH IS MOST NECESSARY TO BE PRESERVED IS THE POWER OF IMPRISONMENT
THE SCOTTISH GENERALS WOULD ENTER INTO NO CONFIDENCE WITH HIM
CHARLES ATTACKED AT BRENTFORD TWO REGIMENTS QUARTERED THERE AND AFTER A SHARP ACTION BEAT THEM FROM THAT VILLAGE AND TOOK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PRISONERS
HERE COMMENCED THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE MILITARY UPON THE CIVIL AUTHORITY
THE PARLIAMENT THOUGH IN THE AGONIES OF DESPAIR MADE STILL ONE EFFORT FOR THE RECOVERY OF THEIR DOMINION
THE TREATY WAS FIRST SIGNED WITH FRANCE THE SITUATION OF THE KING'S AFFAIRS DID NOT ENTITLE HIM TO DEMAND ANY CONDITIONS FOR THE HUGONOTS AND THEY WERE ABANDONED TO THE WILL OF THEIR SOVEREIGN
387
387
MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
THEY CAST THEIR EYES ON ALL SIDES ABROAD AND AT HOME WHENCE EVER THEY COULD EXPECT ANY AID OR SUPPORT
WHILE SUCH IDEAS PREVAILED THE MOST MODERATE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE GIVEN DISGUST
AND IN THESE WERE EMBARKED SIR ARTHUR HAZELRIG JOHN HAMBDEN JOHN PYM AND OLIVER CROMWELL WHO HAD RESOLVED FOREVER TO ABANDON THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY AND FLY TO THE OTHER EXTREMITY OF THE GLOBE
IT CONSISTED ONLY OF THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH AND THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
AFTER THE RESTORATION THOUGH HE REMAINED UNMOLESTED HE THOUGHT PROPER TO TRAVEL FOR SOME YEARS
134
134
IT SEEMS NOW PROPER AFTER SO LONG AN INTERVAL TO LOOK ABROAD TO THE GENERAL STATE OF EUROPE AND TO CONSIDER THE MEASURES WHICH ENGLAND AT THIS TIME EMBRACED IN ITS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE NEIGHBORING PRINCES
GLAMORGAN BIGOTED TO HIS RELIGION AND PASSIONATE FOR THE KING'S SERVICE BUT GUIDED IN THESE PURSUITS BY NO MANNER OF JUDGMENT OR DISCRETION SECRETLY OF HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY COMMUNICATION WITH ORMOND CONCLUDED A PEACE WITH THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY AND AGREED IN THE KING'S NAME THAT THE IRISH SHOULD ENJOY ALL THE CHURCHES OF WHICH THEY HAD EVER BEEN IN POSSESSION SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THEIR INSURRECTION ON CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD ASSIST THE KING IN ENGLAND WITH A BODY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN
SO MUCH HAD MILITARY SKILL DURING A LONG PEACE DECAYED IN ENGLAND WHITLOCKE P
HE WAS VERY STEADY AND EVEN OBSTINATE IN HIS PURPOSE
174
174
174
AND THOUGH THE NAME WAS STILL RETAINED IT WAS AGREED TO ABRIDGE OR RATHER ENTIRELY ANNIHILATE THE POWER OF THE MAJOR-GENERALS
DESBOROW HIS SISTER
ANOTHER QUICKLY FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE
AND ADJOURNING THEMSELVES FOR SOME DAYS ORDERED A COMMITTEE TO SIT IN MERCHANT TAILORS HALL IN THE CITY
THE YOUNG PRINCE UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
IT WAS ALSO DEFENDED WITH MORE ART AND ELOQUENCE
THOSE PATRIOTS WHO ARE NOW THE PUBLIC IDOLS MAY THEN BECOME THE OBJECTS OF GENERAL DETESTATION
THOUGH THEY WERE SUPPRESSED BY COLONEL HEWSON A MAN WHO FROM THE PROFESSION OF A COBBLER HAD RISEN TO A HIGH RANK IN THE ARMY THE CITY STILL DISCOVERED SYMPTOMS OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DISCONTENT
THE TUMULT HOWEVER STILL CONTINUED WITHOUT
WHOEVER INCURRED THEIR DISPLEASURE OR WAS EXPOSED TO THEIR SUSPICIONS WAS COMMITTED TO PRISON AND PROSECUTED UNDER THE NOTION OF DELINQUENCY
AND HALF OF THE KINGDOM BEING ENTIRELY FREED FROM THE ENEMY AND THUS UNITED INTO ONE FIRM BODY MIGHT BE EMPLOYED IN REESTABLISHING THE KING'S AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER
THE NATURAL EFFECT OF THE LONG CIVIL WARS AND OF THE FURIOUS RAGE TO WHICH ALL MEN WERE WROUGHT UP IN THEIR DIFFERENT FACTIONS WAS THAT EVERY ONE'S INCLINATIONS AND AFFECTIONS WERE THOROUGHLY KNOWN
THUS THE SCOTTISH NATION UNDERWENT AND STILL UNDERGO FOR SUCH GRIEVOUS STAINS ARE NOT EASILY WIPED OFF THE REPROACH OF SELLING THEIR KING AND BETRAYING THEIR PRINCE FOR MONEY
THE TRADE TO THE EAST INDIES AND TO GUINEA BECAME CONSIDERABLE
ACCUSTOMED IN ALL INVECTIVES TO JOIN THE PRELATICAL PARTY WITH THE PAPISTS THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY SUPPOSED THIS INSURRECTION TO BE THE RESULT OF THEIR UNITED COUNSELS
THE FAR GREATER PART OF THE KINGDOM WAS EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO THE COVENANT
IN THIS LIST TOO OF PATRIOT ROYALISTS ARE FOUND THE VIRTUOUS NAMES OF HYDE AND FALKLAND
THE EXCHEQUER WAS FOR THAT REASON ABOLISHED AND THE REVENUE PUT UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF A COMMITTEE WHO WERE SUBJECT TO NO CONTROL THE EXCISE WAS AN ODIOUS TAX FORMERLY UNKNOWN TO THE NATION
AND STILL FEWER DURST OPENLY CONDEMN IT
THE ARMY WAS DISCOURAGED AND BEGAN LIKEWISE TO BE DISCONTENTED BOTH FROM THE CONTAGION OF GENERAL DISGUST AND AS AN EXCUSE FOR THEIR MISBEHAVIOR WHICH THEY WERE DESIROUS OF REPRESENTING RATHER AS WANT OF WILL THAN OF COURAGE TO FIGHT
AND WHAT WAS THE PECULIAR GUILT OF THE IRISH CATHOLICS IT WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THAT WHOLE SECT WHO WERE ALREADY SO MUCH THE OBJECT OF GENERAL ABHORRENCE
SUCH DIFFICULTIES SURROUNDED THE PROTECTOR THAT HIS DYING AT SO CRITICAL A TIME IS ESTEEMED BY MANY THE MOST FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT EVER ATTENDED HIM
HIS GARRISON HOWEVER WAS REDUCED TO THE LAST EXTREMITY

THE QUEEN MOTHER OF FRANCE HAVING BEEN FORCED INTO BANISHMENT BY SOME COURT INTRIGUES HAD RETIRED INTO ENGLAND
BUT THE AUTHOR LIKEWISE TOOK OCCASION TO DECLAIM AGAINST HUNTING PUBLIC FESTIVALS CHRISTMAS-KEEPING BONFIRES AND MAY-POLES
AND THE COUNCIL REJECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED WHO EITHER REFUSED A RECOGNITION OF THE PROTECTOR'S GOVERNMENT OR WERE ON OTHER ACCOUNTS OBNOXIOUS TO HIM
140 ETC
AND THAT THESE SHOULD BE SUCCESSIVELY DISCUSSED IN CONFERENCE WITH THE KING'S COMMISSIONERS IT WAS SOON FOUND IMPRACTICABLE TO COME TO ANY AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO ANY OF THESE ARTICLES
WHERE WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THEIR FORMER SERVICES THEY FELL BOTH OF THEM VICTIMS TO THE SEVERITY OF THE PARLIAMENT NEWCASTLE HAVING CARRIED ON THE ATTACK OF HULL FOR SOME TIME WAS BEAT OFF BY A SALLY OF THE GARRISON AND SUFFERED SO MUCH THAT HE THOUGHT PROPER TO RAISE THE SIEGE
A PRACTICE OF WHICH SINCE THE REFORMATION THERE WERE BUT FEW INSTANCES AND WHICH WAS FOR THAT REASON SUPPOSED BY MANY TO BE IRREGULAR
THOUGH HIS MAJESTY SHOULD NOT BE PLEASED TO GRANT THE SAID PARTICULARS IN THE ARTICLES MENTIONED
AND THOUGH THERE WAS REASON TO SUSPECT THAT THIS ALTERATION IN HIS VIEWS HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE ILL CONDUCT OF BUCKINGHAM YET PAST ERRORS COULD NOT BE RETRIEVED
THE COUNTRY PEOPLE INFLAMED WITH NATIONAL ANTIPATHY PUT TO DEATH THE FEW THAT ESCAPED FROM THE FIELD OF BATTLE
AND ENDED WITH SEQUESTRATING AND EJECTING THEM
BUT THIS PUNISHMENT WAS SO FAR FROM QUELLING THE MUTINOUS SPIRIT THAT ABOVE A THOUSAND OF HIS COMPANIONS SHOWED THEIR ADHERENCE TO HIM BY ATTENDING HIS FUNERAL AND WEARING IN THEIR HATS BLACK AND SEA-GREEN RIBBONS BY WAY OF FAVORS
SUSPENDED BETWEEN THESE FEARS AND HIS OWN MOST ARDENT DESIRES CROMWELL PROTRACTED THE TIME AND SEEMED STILL TO OPPOSE THE REASONINGS OF THE COMMITTEE
RICHARD CONTINUED TO POSSESS AN ESTATE WHICH WAS MODERATE AND BURDENED TOO WITH A LARGE DEBT WHICH HE HAD CONTRACTED FOR THE INTERMENT OF HIS FATHER
SLAVISH PRINCIPLES THEY SAID CONCUR WITH ILLEGAL PRACTICES
HOLLIS WAS TO BE MADE SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE ROOM OF WINDEBANK WHO HAD FLED
THE LATTER ATTACKED THE KING'S GARRISONS WHICH LAY TO THE EAST OF BRISTOL
THAT ON THE FIRST CHECK WHICH THEY SHOULD RECEIVE ARGYLE AND HIS PARTISANS WOULD LAY HOLD OF THE QUICKEST EXPEDIENT FOR RECONCILING THEMSELVES TO THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND WOULD BETRAY THE KING AS THEY HAD DONE HIS FATHER INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES
WHOLLY INTENT ON OFFENDING HIS ENEMY HE HAD EXPOSED HIS FRIENDS TO IMMINENT DANGER AND SAW THE KING WITH NUMEROUS FORCES MARCHING INTO ENGLAND
MEN FELT DISPLEASURE AT SEEING THE ROYAL AUTHORITY HIGHLY EXALTED BY THEM AND REPRESENTED AS ABSOLUTE AND UNCONTROLLABLE
OVERCOME FIRST ALL HIS ENEMIES BY ARMS AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AFTERWARDS BY ARTIFICE
PREJUDICES AGAINST AN APOLOGIST FOR THE REGICIDES AND AGAINST A WORK NOT WHOLLY PURGED FROM THE CANT OF FORMER TIMES KEPT THE IGNORANT WORLD FROM PERCEIVING THE PRODIGIOUS MERIT OF THAT PERFORMANCE
HAVE WE EATEN AT ALL OF THE KING'S COST
THE OFFICERS OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE WERE SUMMONED BEFORE THE COMMONS TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT BY WHAT AUTHORITY THEY HAD SEIZED THE GOODS OF MERCHANTS WHO HAD REFUSED TO PAY THESE DUTIES
HEREFORD ESTEEMED A STRONG TOWN DEFENDED BY A CONSIDERABLE GARRISON WAS SURRENDERED TO WALLER FROM THE COWARDICE OF COLONEL PRICE THE GOVERNOR
404 408
FOR SOME YEARS CON A SCOTCHMAN AFTERWARDS ROSETTI AN ITALIAN HAD OPENLY RESIDED AT LONDON AND FREQUENTED THE COURT AS VESTED WITH A COMMISSION FROM THE POPE
AND THEY FOUND IN THIS LATTER FACTION SUCH INVETERATE HATRED AGAINST THE PROTECTOR THAT THEY COULD NOT WISH FOR MORE ZEALOUS ADVERSARIES TO HIS AUTHORITY
ONE HALF TO THE EARL THE OTHER TO THE KING BUSH
O'NEAL MAINTAINED HIS CREDIT IN ULSTER
AND LEST THE HOPE OF RELIEF OR PROTECTION FROM PARLIAMENT MIGHT ENCOURAGE OPPOSITION CHARLES ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN WHICH HE DECLARED THAT WHEREAS FOR SEVERAL ILL ENDS THE CALLING AGAIN OF A PARLIAMENT IS DIVULGED
BUT THOUGH HE GAVE WARNING TO THE ADMINISTRATION IN IRELAND THE INTELLIGENCE WAS ENTIRELY NEGLECTED TEMPLE P
YET AT THAT VERY TIME KING WILLIAM WAS SECRETLY FORMING ALLIANCES TO DETHRONE HIM AND SOON AFTER HE REFUSED HIM THAT TITLE AND INSISTED AS HE HAD REASON THAT HE HAD NOT ACKNOWLEDGED HIS RIGHT
478
478
478
ON A SUDDEN THEY WERE ALARMED BY THE APPROACH OF PRINCE RUPERT
AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS
YET UPON THE WHOLE THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WITH DELICACY AND TENDERNESS AND GIVE AN ADVANTAGEOUS IDEA BOTH OF THE KING'S GENIUS AND MORALS
HE FEARED HE SAID THAT THE OMEN WAS BAD FOR THE INTENDED REFORMATION OF THE STATE THAT IT COMMENCED WITH THE SHEDDING OF INNOCENT BLOOD HAVING BID A LAST ADIEU TO HIS BROTHER AND FRIENDS WHO ATTENDED HIM AND HAVING SENT A BLESSING TO HIS NEARER RELATIONS WHO WERE ABSENT AND NOW SAID HE I HAVE NIGH DONE
AND RETURNED VICTORIOUS TO DUBLIN AFTER KILLING A THOUSAND MEN AND TAKING ABOVE TWO THOUSAND PRISONERS PARL
HOW WIDE ARE THESE PRECEDENTS FROM A POWER OF OBLIGING THE PEOPLE AT THEIR OWN CHARGE TO BUILD NEW SHIPS TO VICTUAL AND PAY THEM FOR THE PUBLIC
AND NEXT MORNING FOUND THEMSELVES IN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER
THE OFFICERS FOUND THEMSELVES AGAIN INVESTED WITH SUPREME AUTHORITY OF WHICH THEY INTENDED FOREVER TO RETAIN THE SUBSTANCE HOWEVER THEY MIGHT BESTOW ON OTHERS THE EMPTY SHADOW OR APPEARANCE
THE KING'S PARTISANS HAD ALL ALONG MAINTAINED THAT THE FEARS AND JEALOUSIES OF THE PARLIAMENT AFTER THE SECURITIES SO EARLY AND EASILY GIVEN TO PUBLIC LIBERTY WERE EITHER FEIGNED OR GROUNDLESS
AT THE TIME OF THE KING'S TRIAL HE HAD FALLEN ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIS FATHER AND HAD CONJURED HIM BY EVERY TIE OF DUTY AND HUMANITY TO SPARE THE LIFE OF THAT MONARCH
THE EARL OF DENBIGH BROTHER-IN-LAW TO BUCKINGHAM WAS DESPATCHED TO THE RELIEF OF ROCHELLE NOW CLOSELY BESIEGED BY LAND AND THREATENED WITH A BLOCKADE BY SEA
232

AND THOUGH HE OPENLY PROTESTED THAT THE COVENANT WAS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL HIS MEASURES HE SECRETLY ENTERED INTO CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ENGLISH ROYALISTS SIR MARMADUKE LANGDALE AND SIR PHILIP MUSGRAVE WHO HAD LEVIED CONSIDERABLE FORCES IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
BACON REPRESENTS IT AS ONE ADVANTAGE TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE UNION THAT THE TOO EXTENSIVE PREROGATIVE OF ENGLAND WOULD BE ABRIDGED BY THE EXAMPLE OF SCOTLAND AND THE TOO NARROW PREROGATIVE OF SCOTLAND BE ENLARGED FROM THE IMITATION OF ENGLAND
IF HE SEIZE A GREAT NUMBER IS NOT THIS EXPEDIENT FORCE OPEN AND BAREFACED
BUT BEING SEDUCED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE TIMES SHE HAD LONG SECONDED HER HUSBAND'S ZEAL AGAINST THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WAS NOW AS WELL AS HE STRUCK WITH ABHORRENCE AT THE FATAL AND UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCE OF ALL HIS BOASTED VICTORIES
AND WHATEVER OTHER POWER PRETENDED TO ANNIHILATE OR EVEN ABRIDGE THE ROYAL AUTHORITY MUST NECESSARILY HE THOUGHT EITHER IN ITS NATURE OR EXERCISE BE DEEMED NO BETTER THAN A USURPATION
MANNING BEING DETECTED AND PUNISHED WITH DEATH HE CORRUPTED SIR RICHARD WILLIS WHO WAS MUCH TRUSTED BY CHANCELLOR HYDE AND ALL THE ROYALISTS
NOR ARE ALL HIS POEMS EQUAL
376
SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX ALARMED AT SO CONSIDERABLE A PROGRESS OF THE ROYALISTS ASSEMBLED AN ARMY OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN IN YORKSHIRE AND HAVING JOINED SIR WILLIAM BRERETON WAS APPROACHING TO THE CAMP OF THE ENEMY
HE READ IT HIMSELF
THIS YEAR JOHN HAMBDEN ACQUIRED BY HIS SPIRIT AND COURAGE UNIVERSAL POPULARITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND HAS MERITED GREAT RENOWN WITH POSTERITY FOR THE BOLD STAND WHICH HE MADE IN DEFENCE OF THE LAWS AND LIBERTIES OF HIS COUNTRY
955
39
39
39
HIS OWN PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MUST BEAR THE BLAME OF WHATEVER DISASTERS SHOULD HENCEFORTH BEFALL HIM
NOT A MOMENT LONGER CRIED THE KING HASTILY AND HE SOON AFTER ENDED THE SESSION BY A DISSOLUTION
THE ATTEMPT THEREFORE OF TOTALLY ANNIHILATING MONARCHICAL POWER WAS A VERY BLAMABLE EXTREME
THE WORDS WITH WHICH HE CONCLUDED THE LETTER ARE REMARKABLE
MONTROSE'S SENTENCE WAS NEXT PRONOUNCED AGAINST HIM
BUT ALL MEN WERE NOW HARASSED AND FATIGUED WITH WARS AND DISORDERS
THIS EVENT WHICH HAD NEITHER CAUSE NOR EFFECT THAT WAS VISIBLE NOR PURPOSE NOR CONSEQUENCE WAS COMMONLY DENOMINATED THE INCIDENT
P 956
BUT HE MUST BE ALLOWED THE BEST JUDGE OF HIS OWN SITUATION
BUT THESE VOTES WERE FEEBLE WEAPONS IN OPPOSITION TO THE SWORDS OF THE SOLDIERY
390
390
CROMWELL BEGAN TO HOPE THAT BY HIS ADMINISTRATION ATTENDED WITH SO MUCH LUSTRE AND SUCCESS ABROAD SO MUCH ORDER AND TRANQUILLITY AT HOME HE HAD NOW ACQUIRED SUCH AUTHORITY AS WOULD ENABLE HIM TO MEET THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION AND WOULD ASSURE HIM OF THEIR DUTIFUL COMPLIANCE WITH HIS GOVERNMENT
HE MAINTAINED A DIGNITY WITHOUT EITHER AFFECTATION OR OSTENTATION
FOR YET IF WE KNOW OUR HEART AT ALL OUR BOWELS DO IN CHRIST YEARN AFTER THE GODLY IN SCOTLAND THURLOE VOL
THEY SAID THAT THE MEN WHO NOW GOVERNED SCOTLAND WERE THE MOST FURIOUS AND BIGOTED OF THAT PARTY WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENTLE GOVERNMENT HAD FIRST EXCITED A REBELLION AGAINST THE LATE KING
BUT THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY INSISTED WERE SO RIGOROUS THAT THE KING FEARING NO WORSE FROM THE MOST IMPLACABLE ENEMIES WAS IN NO HASTE TO COME TO A CONCLUSION
THEY INTRODUCED A BILL FOR PROHIBITING ALL CLERGYMEN THE EXERCISE OF ANY CIVIL OFFICE
BEING INFORMED OF THIS DESIGN HE HASTENED TO THE CAMP
SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH MINUTE IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO TRANSMIT TO POSTERITY
REPEATED ATTEMPTS WHICH HE MADE FOR A PEACEFUL AND EQUITABLE ACCOMMODATION WITH THE PARLIAMENT SERVED TO NO PURPOSE BUT TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THE VICTORY WAS ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT MEN OF QUALITY HAD APPEARED IN ANY VIOLENT ACT OF OPPOSITION BUT THIS PROVED A CRISIS
THERE IS HOWEVER IT MUST BE CONFESSED A DIFFERENCE UNIVERSALLY AVOWED BETWEEN SIMPLY GIVING TO MEN THE APPELLATION WHICH THEY ASSUME AND THE FORMAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR TITLE TO IT
SINCE THE PEOPLE HAD STILL RESERVED TO THEMSELVES THE RIGHT OF JUDGING HOW FAR THAT SERVICE MERITED SUCH A SUPPLY
654
AND IS NO SOONER CANVASSED WITH IMPARTIALITY THAN ITS WEAKNESS IS DISCOVERED
AND EVERY ORDER OF THE STATE AND EVERY SECT WERE REDUCED TO PAY SUBMISSION TO THE LAWFUL AUTHORITY OF THE SOVEREIGN
293
293
293
NOTHING IS MORE USUAL IN ALL PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS THAN SUCH DISTINCTIONS
THAT WHATEVER SUPPLIES HAD BEEN LEVIED ON HIS SUBJECTS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE AND PRESERVATION
HAVING FLATTERED THEMSELVES IN THE FERVOR OF THEIR ZEAL THAT BY SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCES THEY SHOULD BE ENABLED TO CARRY THEIR TRIUMPHANT COVENANT TO THE GATES OF ROME ITSELF IT BEHOVED THEM FIRST TO RENDER IT PREVALENT IN ENGLAND WHICH ALREADY SHOWED SO GREAT A DISPOSITION TO RECEIVE IT
THE FOLLOWING IS A PASSAGE OF A LETTER FROM LORD KENSINGTON AMBASSADOR IN FRANCE TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM CABBALA P
BUT THE PRESENT WAS NO TIME FOR QUESTION OR DISPUTE
THIS INCIDENT PROCURED HIM AFTERWARDS BETTER TREATMENT AND MORE AUTHORITY
YOU CANNOT SETTLE THE NATION BUT BY MY ASSISTANCE A PEOPLE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT AND WITHOUT LIBERTY A PARLIAMENT WITHOUT AUTHORITY AN ARMY WITHOUT A LEGAL MASTER
IT IS YOU SAID HE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE THAT HAVE FORCED ME UPON THIS
SENSIBLE THAT THE MEASURES WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO PURSUED RENDERED THEM EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS TO THE KING
AND SO FAR HAD THE ILLUSIONS OF FANATICISM PREVAILED OVER THE PLAINEST DICTATES OF NATURAL MORALITY THAT HE ASSUMED MORE THE CHARACTER OF A MEDIATOR IN INTERCEDING FOR HIS PEOPLE THAN THAT OF A CRIMINAL WHOSE ATROCIOUS VIOLATION OF SOCIAL DUTY HAD FROM EVERY TRIBUNAL HUMAN AND DIVINE MERITED THE SEVEREST VENGEANCE
EVEN THOUGH NO FURTHER MOTIVE HAD BEEN SUSPECTED THE REFUSAL OF SUPPLY IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NATURALLY TO HIM APPEAR CRUEL AND DECEITFUL
AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE
THOUGH THE KING'S TROOPS DEFENDED THEMSELVES WITH VALOR THEY WERE OVERPOWERED BY NUMBERS
THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN
AND THE BILLS SENT UP BY THE COMMONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO STOPPED WITH THE PEERS AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN REJECTED NOW PASSED AND WERE PRESENTED FOR THE ROYAL ASSENT
BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY
TO CORRECT THE LATE DISORDERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED SOME NEW LAWS WHICH WOULD NO DOUBT APPEAR HARSH TO A PRINCE SO ENAMORED OF HIS PREROGATIVE
HE OBLIGED THE MEMBERS TO SIGN A RECOGNITION OF HIS AUTHORITY AND AN ENGAGEMENT NOT TO PROPOSE OR CONSENT TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE GOVERNMENT AS IT WAS SETTLED IN A SINGLE PERSON AND A PARLIAMENT
THOUGH THE CONCURRENCE OF THE CHURCH UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASED THE KING'S ADHERENTS IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED THAT THE HIGH MONARCHICAL DOCTRINES SO MUCH INCULCATED BY THE CLERGY HAD NEVER DONE HIM ANY REAL SERVICE
CENSURE ME NOT FOR HAVING PARTED WITH SO MUCH OF OUR RIGHT
AND BESIDES A GREAT CONCOURSE OF THE PEOPLE ALL THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF ANY FAMILY OR INTEREST WERE PRESENT EITHER AS MEMBERS ASSESSORS OR SPECTATORS
LAYING ASIDE THE STATE OF PROTECTOR WHICH ON OTHER OCCASIONS HE WELL KNEW HOW TO MAINTAIN HE INSINUATED TO THEM THAT NOTHING BUT NECESSITY COULD EVER OBLIGE HIM TO INVEST HIMSELF WITH IT
A VAIN FORMALITY TOO WEAK TO RESTRAIN THE UNGOVERNED AMBITION OF PRINCES
MR FAUCET THE PREACHER THERE NOT HAVING TILL THEN ENDED HIS SERMON
HE WAS NOT CALLED TO ASSIST AT ANY COUNCILS
IT WAS THOUGHT SOMEWHAT HARD THAT GENERAL INVECTIVES AGAINST PLAYS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED INTO SATIRES AGAINST THE KING AND QUEEN MERELY BECAUSE THEY FREQUENTED THESE AMUSEMENTS AND BECAUSE THE QUEEN SOMETIMES ACTED A PART IN PASTORALS AND INTERLUDES WHICH WERE REPRESENTED AT COURT
THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL
AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF SOME TIME AND THE GRIEVOUS SUFFERANCE OF MANY VIOLENT OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE NOW AT LAST AS THOSE SLAVES OBTAINED FOR A DAY SOME LIBERTY OF SPEECH
FORCES WERE REGULARLY ENLISTED AND DISCIPLINED
THE SOLDIERS LAMENTED THAT THEY WERE DEPRIVED OF THE PRIVILEGES OF ENGLISHMEN
88
88
ALL HIS FRIENDS HAD ACCESS TO HIS PRESENCE
THE KING ON PRETENCE OF TREASON MAY SEIZE ANY MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE FACTION AND FOR A TIME GAIN TO HIS PARTISANS THE MAJORITY OF VOICES
THAT THE HALL WHERE THE PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLES IS AN INVIOLABLE SANCTUARY WAS NEVER YET PRETENDED
AND WHEN THEY SENT UP THIS BILL TO THE LORDS THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE
BUT AMIDST ALL THIS APPEARANCE OF RESPECT CHARLES REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE MOST RIGID COVENANTERS
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS RULE IT IS CERTAIN CONTRIBUTES TO THE ORDER AND REGULARITY AS WELL AS FREEDOM OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS
WHEN THE EXCEPTION REALLY OCCURS EVEN THOUGH IT BE NOT PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED AND DESCANTED ON IT MUST FROM ITS VERY NATURE BE SO OBVIOUS AND UNDISPUTED AS TO REMOVE ALL DOUBT AND OVERPOWER THE RESTRAINT HOWEVER GREAT IMPOSED BY TEACHING THE GENERAL DOCTRINE OF OBEDIENCE
BUT THAT NOBLEMAN UNFORTUNATELY BOTH FOR KING AND PEOPLE DIED ABOUT THIS VERY TIME
CURSE YE MEROZ SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
BUT THE COURT REFUSED COMPLIANCE AND CONSIDERED THAT REQUEST AS NOTHING BUT A DELAY OF JUSTICE
BUT PROVED MORE FATAL IN ITS CONSEQUENCES
PUT HIM TO DEATH AS THE FIRST VICTIM TO THEIR MURDERED SOVEREIGN F VERY LEISURELY AND PEACEABLY SEPARATED THEMSELVES
STAMFORD RETIRED AND DISTRIBUTED HIS FORCES INTO PLYMOUTH AND EXETER
THAT RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES MIGHT SUPPORT CIVIL AUTHORITY SERMONS WERE PREACHED BY SIBTHORPE AND MANWARING IN FAVOR OF THE GENERAL LOAN
BECAUSE IN HIS UTMOST DISTRESSES SHE HAD ASSISTED HER HUSBAND WITH ARMS AND AMMUNITION WHICH SHE HAD BOUGHT IN HOLLAND AND HAD SHE FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS NEITHER HER SEX SHE KNEW NOR HIGH STATION COULD PROTECT HER AGAINST INSULTS AT LEAST IF NOT DANGER FROM THOSE HAUGHTY REPUBLICANS WHO SO LITTLE AFFECTED TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES BY THE MAXIMS OF GALLANTRY AND POLITENESS
IN A FEW DAYS THE LOWER HOUSE PASSED A VOTE THAT THEY WOULD MAKE NO MORE ADDRESSES TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS NOR RECEIVE ANY FRONT THEM
AND AS ALL ESSENTIAL DISTINCTION WAS DENIED BETWEEN THE LAITY AND THE CLERGY NO CEREMONY NO INSTITUTION NO VOCATION NO IMPOSITION OF HANDS WAS AS IN ALL OTHER CHURCHES SUPPOSED REQUISITE TO CONVEY A RIGHT TO HOLY ORDERS
170
IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED TO THE KING
HE COMPLAINED OF THE GENERAL REPROACHES THROWN OUT IN THE REMONSTRANCE WITH REGARD TO ILL COUNSELS THOUGH HE HAD PROTECTED NO MINISTER FROM PARLIAMENTARY JUSTICE RETAINED NO UNPOPULAR SERVANT AND CONFERRED OFFICES ON NO ONE WHO ENJOYED NOT A HIGH CHARACTER AND ESTIMATION IN THE PUBLIC
WHEN PROVIDENCE THEREFORE WAS SO KIND AS TO BESTOW ON THESE MEN NOW ASSEMBLED TOGETHER THE SUPREME AUTHORITY THEY MUST HAVE BEEN VERY UNGRATEFUL IF IN THEIR TURN THEY HAD BEEN WANTING IN COMPLAISANCE TOWARDS IT
EVEN DISEASES AND BODILY DISTEMPERS WERE NOT TOTALLY EXEMPTED FROM IT
WHAT ALONE GAVE SOME STABILITY TO ALL THESE UNSETTLED HUMORS WAS THE GREAT INFLUENCE BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY ACQUIRED BY OLIVER CROMWELL
YET THE HARDSHIPS WHICH THEY SUFFERED FROM THE SIEGE DURING SO EARLY A SEASON HAD WEAKENED THEM TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER FIT FOR ANY NEW ENTERPRISE
HIS CAVALRY IN WHICH CONSISTED HIS CHIEF STRENGTH EXCEEDED NOT EIGHT HUNDRED AND WERE VERY ILL PROVIDED WITH ARMS
BY MEANS HOWEVER OF THAT SUPPLY AND BY OTHER EXPEDIENTS HE WAS THOUGH WITH DIFFICULTY ENABLED TO EQUIP HIS FLEET
JUSTICE WAS STRICTLY ADMINISTERED
WHEN THE PRISONERS LANDED IN ENGLAND THEY WERE RECEIVED AND ENTERTAINED WITH THE HIGHEST DEMONSTRATIONS OF AFFECTION
THE ARMIES WHICH FOUGHT ON BOTH SIDES WERE ALMOST EQUALLY HIS ENEMIES
HOLLIS GIVES THE SAME REPRESENTATION AS WALKER OF THE PLUNDERING OPPRESSIONS AND TYRANNY OF THE PARLIAMENT
THOUGH CHARLES KEPT HIS EARS OPEN TO ALL PROPOSALS AND EXPECTED TO HOLD THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE OPPOSITE PARTIES HE ENTERTAINED MORE HOPES OF ACCOMMODATION WITH THE ARMY
HE AGREED SIMPLY TO ABOLISH THEM
BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY
414
414
414
OF ALL CHRISTIAN SECTS THIS WAS THE FIRST WHICH DURING ITS PROSPERITY AS WELL AS ITS ADVERSITY ALWAYS ADOPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF TOLERATION
THE SYNOD MEETING AT PERTH AND CITING THE MINISTERS AND PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPRESSED A DISLIKE OF THEIR HEAVENLY GOVERNMENT THE MEN BEING OUT OF THE WAY THEIR WIVES RESOLVED TO ANSWER FOR THEM

SANDERSON P
SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR SAID THIS IS THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE KINGDOM
AND WHATEVER HIS PRIVATE ADVICE MIGHT BE THIS SALUTARY MAXIM HE FAILED NOT OFTEN AND PUBLICLY TO INCULCATE IN THE KING'S PRESENCE THAT IF ANY INEVITABLE NECESSITY EVER OBLIGED THE SOVEREIGN TO VIOLATE THE LAWS THIS LICENSE OUGHT TO BE PRACTISED WITH EXTREME RESERVE AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A JUST ATONEMENT BE MADE TO THE CONSTITUTION FOR ANY INJURY WHICH IT MIGHT SUSTAIN FROM SUCH DANGEROUS PRECEDENTS THE FIRST PARLIAMENT AFTER THE RESTORATION REVERSED THE BILL OF ATTAINDER
AND EVERY MAN NEGLECTING HIS OWN BUSINESS WAS WHOLLY INTENT ON THE DEFENCE OF LIBERTY AND RELIGION
SHE KNEW THE IMPLACABLE HATRED WHICH THE PARLIAMENT ON ACCOUNT OF HER RELIGION AND HER CREDIT WITH THE KING HAD ALL ALONG BORNE HER
AND ALL MEN UNDER WHATEVER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THEY WERE BORN REJECTED THE EXAMPLE AS THE UTMOST EFFORT OF UNDISGUISED USURPATION AND THE MOST HEINOUS INSULT ON LAW AND JUSTICE
THE ENGLISH COMMONS ENTERTAINED THE GREATEST APPREHENSIONS ON ACCOUNT OF THIS ARMY AND NEVER CEASED SOLICITING THE KING TILL HE AGREED TO BREAK IT
AND WITH GREAT FIRMNESS AND VIGOR OPPOSED ALL THE MEASURES OF THE KING
THE VICTORY WAS PURSUED WITH IMPETUOSITY BY THE SAGACIOUS COMMONS WHO KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF A FAVORABLE MOMENT IN ALL POPULAR COMMOTIONS
THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT LAY AT NORTHAMPTON WITHIN A FEW DAYS MARCH OF HIM AND CONSISTED OF ABOVE SIX THOUSAND MEN WELL ARMED AND WELL APPOINTED
AN ARTIFICE BY WHICH BESIDES INCREASING THEIR OWN PRIVILEGES THEY WEAKENED STILL FURTHER THE VERY SMALL PARTY WHICH THE KING SECRETLY RETAINED IN THE HOUSE
SIR JOHN CLOTWORTHY AN IRISH GENTLEMAN SIR JOHN HOTHAM OF YORKSHIRE AND MANY OTHERS ENTERED INTO THE SAME TOPICS AND AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SPENT IN BITTER INVECTIVE WHEN THE DOORS WERE LOCKED IN ORDER TO PREVENT ALL DISCOVERY OF THEIR PURPOSE IT WAS MOVED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RESOLUTION SECRETLY TAKEN THAT STRAFFORD SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE IMPEACHED OF HIGH TREASON
HIS CHARACTER WAS STATELY AND AUSTERE
PERHAPS THE ENGLISH IS THE FIRST MIXED GOVERNMENT WHERE THE AUTHORITY OF EVERY PART HAS BEEN VERY ACCURATELY DEFINED
THE SAGACITY OF HIS ACTIONS AND THE ABSURDITY OF HIS DISCOURSE FORM THE MOST PRODIGIOUS CONTRAST THAT EVER WAS KNOWN
NOR HAS EITHER HOUSE DURING FORMER AGES EVER PRETENDED IN ANY OF THOSE CASES TO INTERPOSE IN BEHALF OF ITS MEMBERS
THE KING IT SEEMS AND THE LORDS WERE RESOLVED NOT TO TRUST THEM
AND IF HE NOW MET WITH KIND AND DUTIFUL USAGE IT WOULD ENDEAR TO HIM THE USE OF PARLIAMENTS AND WOULD FOREVER PRESERVE AN ENTIRE HARMONY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PEOPLE TO THESE REASONS THE COMMONS REMAINED INEXORABLE
THE DEISTS WERE PERFECTLY HATED BY CROMWELL BECAUSE HE HAD NO HOLD OF ENTHUSIASM BY WHICH HE COULD GOVERN OR OVERREACH THEM
IMPRISONING US WITHOUT BAIL OR BOND
V GUMBLE'S LIFE OF MONK
THE FANATICAL SPIRIT LET LOOSE CONFOUNDED ALL REGARD TO EASE SAFETY INTEREST
THEY APPLIED TO HIM FOR ORDERS TO BELLASIS GOVERNOR OF NEWARK TO SURRENDER THAT TOWN NOW REDUCED TO EXTREMITY
SEE NOTE R AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
HE WANTED SUPPLENESS AND DEXTERITY SUFFICIENT FOR THE FIRST MEASURE
AND THEIR FRANTIC CLERGY DECLAIMED EQUALLY AGAINST THE KING AND AGAINST CROMWELL
NAY I CAN LIVE THOUGH BURDENED WITH IMPOSITIONS BEYOND WHAT AT PRESENT I LABOR UNDER
THEIR LIBERTIES THEY SAID WERE INVADED
AND WOULD SHORTLY BRING THEIR COUNTRY UNDER THE MOST INSUPPORTABLE SERVITUDE TO WHICH ANY NATION HAD EVER BEEN REDUCED
AND THE MEMBERS SHARING ALL OFFICES OF POWER AND PROFIT AMONG THEM PROCEEDED WITH IMPUNITY IN EXERCISING ACTS OF OPPRESSION ON THE HELPLESS NATION
BUT WHAT MADE MOST NOISE WAS THE CITY PETITION FOR A TOTAL ALTERATION OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT
AFTER THE CHARGE WAS FINISHED THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED HIS DISCOURSE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT THE COURT EXPECTED HIS ANSWER
THE CONDUCT OF THE PROTECTOR IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS THOUGH IMPRUDENT AND IMPOLITIC WAS FULL OF VIGOR AND ENTERPRISE AND DREW A CONSIDERATION TO HIS COUNTRY WHICH SINCE THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH IT SEEMED TO HAVE TOTALLY LOST
THOUGH HE HAD OFFERED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION TO GIVE HIS CONSENT TO ANY LAW FOR THE SECURITY OF THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE HE HAD NOT EXPECTED THAT SUCH INROADS WOULD BE MADE ON HIS PREROGATIVE
THE PARLIAMENT INSISTED ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERY THE SALE OF THE CHAPTER LANDS THE ABOLITION OF ALL FORMS OF PRAYER AND STRICT LAWS AGAINST CATHOLICS
THAT BOLD MEASURE EXECUTED BY JOYCE HAD NEVER BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE GENERAL
HAD HE BUILT ANY PROJECTS ON THAT REBELLION WOULD HE NOT HAVE WAITED SOME LITTLE TIME TO SEE HOW THEY WOULD SUCCEED
AND HAVING SOME AFFINITY TO THE ROMISH WORSHIP LED THEM TO MOLLIFY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THESE SEVERE PREJUDICES AND TO SPEAK OF THE CATHOLICS IN MORE CHARITABLE LANGUAGE AND WITH MORE RECONCILING EXPRESSIONS
SELDOM HE SLEPT ABOVE THREE NIGHTS TOGETHER IN THE SAME CHAMBER
CHARLES EXHORTED THIS BODY OF CAVALRY NOT TO DESPAIR AND CRIED ALOUD TO THEM ONE CHARGE MORE AND WE RECOVER THE DAY BUT THE DISADVANTAGES UNDER WHICH THEY LABORED WERE TOO EVIDENT
SECRETARIES AND CLERKS WERE CORRUPTED THE GREATEST ZEALOTS IN ALL PARTIES WERE OFTEN THESE WHO CONVEYED PRIVATE INFORMATION TO HIM
HIS BENEFICENT DISPOSITION WAS CLOUDED BY A MANNER NOT VERY GRACIOUS
AND THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY REVIVED IN THOSE NORTH-WEST COUNTIES OF ENGLAND
FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE
1329
PERHAPS TOO WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY TO MAKE THE CONCLUDING STEP AND OFFER BAREFACED VIOLENCE TO THEIR SOVEREIGN THEIR SCRUPLES AND APPREHENSIONS THOUGH NOT SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THEIR RESOLUTIONS WERE ABLE TO RETARD THE EXECUTION OF THEM SIR JACOB ASTLEY WHOM THE KING HAD APPOINTED MAJOR-GENERAL OF HIS INTENDED ARMY TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE HIM ASSURANCE BUT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN OUT OF HIS BED IF THE REBELS SHOULD MAKE A BRISK ATTEMPT TO THAT PURPOSE
WHILE THE OPPOSITION FOR WE MUST STILL HAVE AN OPPOSITION OPEN OR DISGUISED ENDEAVORS TO DRAW EVERY BRANCH OF ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE COGNIZANCE OF PARLIAMENT THE COURTIERS RESERVE A PART TO THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN
HE TOLD THE PARLIAMENT THAT BY A PROMISE OF SUBSIDIES HE HAD ENGAGED THE KING OF DENMARK TO TAKE PART IN THE WAR
AND FORESAW THAT THE OPPOSITE PARTY IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD EFFECT THE RESTORATION OF MONARCHY WITHOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERY IN ENGLAND
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
AND BY HIS EXAMPLE HE FURTHER CONFIRMED THEIR RESOLUTION WHEN THEY SHOULD ACQUIRE POWER TO PAY LIKE DISREGARD TO THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN
HARRISON AND THE OTHER DISCARDED OFFICERS OF THAT PARTY COULD NOT REMAIN AT REST
AND GIVING HER IN MARRIAGE TO HIS NEPHEW LOUIS ENDEAVORED TO CEMENT BY THIS NEW TIE THE INCOMPATIBLE INTERESTS OF THE TWO MONARCHIES
HIS CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRED DISSIMULATION

AFTER FRANCE AND HOLLAND HAD ENTERED INTO A LEAGUE AGAINST SPAIN AND FRAMED A TREATY OF PARTITION BY WHICH THEY WERE TO CONQUER AND TO DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM THE LOW COUNTRY PROVINCES ENGLAND WAS INVITED TO PRESERVE A NEUTRALITY BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES WHILE THE FRENCH AND DUTCH SHOULD ATTACK THE MARITIME TOWNS OF FLANDERS
POPERY AND PRELACY ALONE WHOSE GENIUS SEEMED TO TEND TOWARDS SUPERSTITION WERE TREATED BY THE INDEPENDENTS WITH RIGOR
THE ARMY IN IRELAND WAS NOT MUCH SHORT OF TWENTY THOUSAND MEN
THE CONNECTIONS WHICH HE HAD FORMED WITH CROMWELL HIS BENEFACTOR PRESERVED HIM FAITHFUL TO RICHARD WHO HAD BEEN ENJOINED BY HIS FATHER TO FOLLOW IN EVERY THING THE DIRECTIONS OF GENERAL MONK
AND THAT IT WOULD BE ILL MANNERS IN HIM TO SPEAK WHILE HIS MASTER CHRIST WAS SPEAKING IN HER KING'S DECLARATION AT LARGE P
AND THE NEUTERS FOUND IT AT LAST REQUISITE TO SEEK SHELTER IN ONE OR THE OTHER FACTION
MAY BOOK II P
MAY BOOK II P
THE MURDER OF THE KING THE MOST ATROCIOUS OF ALL HIS ACTIONS WAS TO HIM COVERED UNDER A MIGHTY CLOUD OF REPUBLICAN AND FANATICAL ILLUSIONS
ARGYLE REENFORCED BY THE EARL OF LOTHIAN WAS BEHIND HIM WITH A GREAT ARMY
AND CHARLES HAD INTENDED TO ADVANCE GARDINER RECORDER OF LONDON TO THAT IMPORTANT TRUST
AND THEY DECLARED IT A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE
ONE RASH AND PASSIONATE ATTEMPT OF THE KING'S SEEMED BUT A SMALL COUNTERBALANCE TO SO MANY ACTS OF DELIBERATE VIOLENCE WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIM AND EVERY BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
SIR EDWARD CECIL LATELY CREATED VISCOUNT WIMBLETON WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND
AND IT WAS IN VAIN THAT CROMWELL MADE EVERY ATTEMPT TO BRING HIM TO AN ENGAGEMENT
THE YOUNG KING POOR AND NEGLECTED LIVING SOMETIMES IN HOLLAND SOMETIMES IN FRANCE SOMETIMES IN JERSEY COMFORTED HIMSELF AMIDST HIS PRESENT DISTRESSES WITH THE HOPES OF BETTER FORTUNE
THAT CONFUSED AND INACCURATE GENIUS OF GOVERNMENT OF WHICH FRANCE PARTOOK IN COMMON WITH OTHER EUROPEAN KINGDOMS HE CHANGED INTO A SIMPLE MONARCHY
AND IT SEEMS THE DUTY OF AN HISTORIAN TO POINT OUT THE PROPER INFERENCES AND CONCLUSIONS
298
298
298
THIS FURTHER CONFIRMED THE SUSPICION OF A DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY
BY THE PRESENT FURY OF THE PEOPLE AS BY AN INUNDATION WERE ALL THESE OBSTACLES SWEPT AWAY AND EVERY RAMPART OF ROYAL AUTHORITY LAID LEVEL WITH THE GROUND
BEFORE ASSEMBLING THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT THIS MAN DEVOTED TO THE PURSUITS OF LEARNING AND TO THE SOCIETY OF ALL THE POLITE AND ELEGANT HAD ENJOYED HIMSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE WHICH A FINE GENIUS A GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND AN OPULENT FORTUNE COULD AFFORD
HE DIED IN 1677 AGED SIXTY-SIX
WHEN THE EARL OF DERBY WAS ALIVE HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY IRETON TO SURRENDER THE ISLE OF MAN
AND IT SEEMED JUST THAT THE KING SHOULD NOT STRICTLY INSIST ON THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND OBLIGE PEOPLE OF SO SMALL REVENUE TO ACCEPT OF THAT EXPENSIVE HONOR
252
IN ENGLAND FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FOOT TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY HORSE GARRISONS SIX THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR
HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE PRETENDED THAT THE FORMER DISPLAY OF HIS ARBITRARY INCLINATIONS OR RATHER HIS MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLES RENDERED AN OFFENSIVE OR PREVENTIVE WAR IN THE PARLIAMENT PRUDENT AND REASONABLE IT COULD NEVER IN ANY PROPRIETY OF SPEECH MAKE IT BE TERMED A DEFENSIVE ONE
AND THE GENERAL INFERENCE WAS STILL INCULCATED THAT A FORMED DESIGN HAD BEEN LAID TO SUBVERT THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM
MEN OF PROBITY AND HONOR HE KNEW WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO BE THE INSTRUMENTS OF A USURPATION VIOLENT AND ILLEGAL
THE ASTONISHING GREATNESS OF THE CALAMITY DEPRIVED THE SUFFERERS OF ANY RELIEF FROM THE VIEW OF COMPANIONS IN AFFLICTION
271
ORRERY FINDING THEM IN GOOD HUMOR AND BEING ALONE WITH THEM ASKED IF HE MIGHT PRESUME TO DESIRE TO KNOW WHY THEY WOULD ONCE HAVE CLOSED WITH HIS MAJESTY AND WHY THEY DID NOT
AND THEY EQUIPPED SOME SHIPS OF A LARGER SIZE THAN ANY WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO SENT TO SEA
175 176 ETC 325 326 ETC
AND BEING NAMED GENERAL OF THE WESTERN COUNTIES WHERE HIS INTEREST CHIEFLY LAY HE BEGAN TO ASSEMBLE FORCES IN SOMERSETSHIRE
THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COUNCIL WAS OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE WAR WITH THE SCOTS THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY THE ANSWER ASCRIBED TO STRAFFORD WAS IN THESE WORDS
THE VERY DREGS OF THE FANATICS
DISMISSING HIS ANCIENT SERVANTS DEBARRING HIM FROM VISITS AND CUTTING OFF ALL COMMUNICATION WITH HIS FRIENDS OR FAMILY
466
466
466
THE VERY INSURRECTION ITSELF HE REGARDED AS A FORTUNATE EVENT
THEIR UNSURMOUNTABLE PASSION DISGUISED TO THEMSELVES AS WELL AS TO OTHERS UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF HOLY FERVORS WAS WELL QUALIFIED TO MAKE PROSELYTES AND TO SEIZE THE MINDS OF THE IGNORANT MULTITUDE
THE CASE WAS ARGUED DURING TWELVE DAYS IN THE EXCHEQUER CHAMBER BEFORE ALL THE JUDGES OF ENGLAND
AND JOINING THEIR ARMIES TO THOSE OF WALLER AND MIDDLETON AS WELL AS OF ESSEX OFFER BATTLE TO THE KING
744
NOR COULD THEY EVER INTEND TO JOIN LENITY AND RIGOR TOGETHER IN SO INCONSISTENT A MANNER
AFTER THE BATTLE THE KING RETREATED WITH THAT BODY OF HORSE WHICH REMAINED ENTIRE FIRST TO HEREFORD THEN TO ABERGAVENNY
AND THIS TRANSACTION IS NOT REGARDED AS ANY OBJECTION TO HIS CHARACTER IN THAT PARTICULAR
THE PRIMATE A MAN OF WISDOM AND PRUDENCE WHO WAS ALL ALONG AVERSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE LITURGY REPRESENTED TO THE KING THE STATE OF THE NATION
IT WAS THE ONLY REMAINING GARRISON POSSESSED BY THE PARLIAMENT IN THOSE PARTS

HE HAD INSTRUMENTS HE SAID WHOM HE COULD EMPLOY
BLAKE HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED
CHARLES WHO WAS NATURALLY APT TO BE SWAYED BY COUNSEL AND WHO HAD NOT THEN ACCESS TO ANY GOOD COUNSEL TOOK SUDDENLY A RESOLUTION OF WITHDRAWING HIMSELF THOUGH WITHOUT ANY CONCERTED AT LEAST ANY RATIONAL SCHEME FOR THE FUTURE DISPOSAL OF HIS PERSON
ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES FURTHER INSTIGATED THE COMMONS IN THEIR INVASION OF ROYAL PREROGATIVE
A MEASURE NOT UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ZEALOUS FRIENDS OF LIBERTY WHO OBSERVED WITH REGRET THE DEVOTED ATTACHMENT OF THAT ORDER TO THE WILL OF THE MONARCH
WHY OTHERWISE DID HE QUARREL WITH SPAIN
BUT THE EXECUTION OF THIS OLD INFIRM PRELATE WHO HAD SO LONG REMAINED AN INOFFENSIVE PRISONER CAN BE ASCRIBED TO NOTHING BUT VENGEANCE AND BIGOTRY IN THOSE SEVERE RELIGIONISTS BY WHOM THE PARLIAMENT WAS ENTIRELY GOVERNED
HOPING THAT THE GENERAL AFFECTION TO THE KING'S SERVICE AND THE FAME OF HIS FORMER EXPLOITS WOULD MAKE THE HIGHLANDERS FLOCK TO HIS STANDARD
AND AS HE WAS EXTREMELY ADDICTED TO A REPUBLIC AND EVEN TO THE FIFTH MONARCHY OR DOMINION OF THE SAINTS IT WAS EASY FOR THOSE WHO HAD INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO HIS CONFIDENCE TO INSTIL DISGUSTS AGAINST THE DIGNITY OF PROTECTOR
THAT HE OFFERED THE KING WHEN HIS MAJESTY WAS IN SCOTLAND TO ASSASSINATE ARGYLE
HE DESIRED THE PARISHIONERS TO STAY A WHILE SAYING HE HAD A MESSAGE FROM GOD UNTO THEM AND THEREUPON OFFERED TO GO INTO THE PULPIT
BLAKE WAS RATHER ANIMATED THAN DAUNTED WITH THIS APPEARANCE
PORTUGAL HAD REBELLED AND ESTABLISHED HER MONARCHY IN THE HOUSE OF BRAGANZA
AND WHEN THIS DEMAND WAS NOT COMPLIED WITH THEY DESPATCHED ORDERS FOR COMMENCING WAR AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES
99 106
ASHTON STOREY AND BESTLEY WERE HANGED IN DIFFERENT STREETS OF THE CITY
HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS
AMONG THOSE WHO WERE ENRAGED AT THIS TREATMENT WAS SEXBY AN ACTIVE AGITATOR WHO NOW EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM ALL THAT RESTLESS INDUSTRY WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN EXERTED IN HIS FAVOR
266
266
AND AFTER THEIR EXPULSION HAD BEEN TOTALLY ANNIHILATED
NO ONE DURST OPENLY AVOW HIMSELF OF THAT PARTY
HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC
FAIRFAX FOLLOWED HIM AND VIGOROUSLY PURSUED THE VICTORY
THESE LATTER WHITE THEY CLAIMED TO THEMSELVES A DIVINE RIGHT ADMITTED OF A LIKE ORIGIN TO CIVIL AUTHORITY
CROMWELL JEALOUS OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THAT OF ORANGE INSISTED ON A SEPARATE ARTICLE
WHERE HIS PRESENCE FROM THE GENERAL HATRED WHICH PREVAILED AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT WAS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SOME GREAT REVOLUTION
850
850
AND PROVES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PREVALENCY OF BIGOTRY AND FANATICISM THERE WERE MANY MEMBERS WHO HAD MORE ENLARGED VIEWS AND PAID REGARD TO THE CIVIL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
CROMWELL HAVING BROKEN THE FORCE AND COURAGE OF THE IRISH WAS SENT FOR
136 142 189 252
NOR COULD THE PARLIAMENT AFTER IT WAS ASSEMBLED BE ADJOURNED PROROGUED OR DISSOLVED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT DURING THE SPACE OF FIFTY DAYS
BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT CONTAIN THE FULLEST AND MOST AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
AND BY THAT MEANS HE BOTH ATTACHED THE WILD SECTARIES TO HIS PERSON AND EMPLOYED THEM IN CURBING THE DOMINEERING SPIRIT OF THE PRESBYTERIANS
ASHLEY THE KING'S SERJEANT HAVING ASSERTED IN PLEADING BEFORE THE PEERS THAT THE KING MUST SOMETIMES GOVERN BY ACTS OF STATE AS WELL AS BY LAW THIS POSITION GAVE SUCH OFFENCE THAT HE WAS IMMEDIATELY COMMITTED TO PRISON AND WAS NOT RELEASED BUT UPON HIS RECANTATION AND SUBMISSION BEING HOWEVER AFRAID LEST THE COMMONS SHOULD GO TOO FAR IN THEIR PROJECTED PETITION THE PEERS PROPOSED A PLAN OF ONE MORE MODERATE WHICH THEY RECOMMENDED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE OTHER HOUSE
GENTLEMEN I AM SORRY FOR THIS OCCASION OF COMING TO YOU
I TELL YOU YOU ARE NO LONGER A PARLIAMENT
ESSEX ROBARTS AND SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS ESCAPED IN A BOAT TO PLYMOUTH
AN INTENTION OF OFFERING VIOLENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT OF SEIZING THE ACCUSED MEMBERS IN THE VERY HOUSE AND OF MURDERING ALL WHO SHOULD MAKE RESISTANCE WAS INFERRED
ONE REGIMENT IN PARTICULAR QUARTERED IN SOMERSET HOUSE EXPRESSLY REFUSED TO YIELD THEIR PLACE TO THE NORTHERN ARMY
16 ETC
THE DOMESTIC ADMINISTRATION OF CROMWELL THOUGH IT DISCOVERS GREAT ABILITIES WAS CONDUCTED WITHOUT ANY PLAN EITHER OF LIBERTY OR ARBITRARY POWER
HE DESPATCHED LETTERS TO THE PARLIAMENT EXHORTING THEM NOT TO BE DISMAYED AT THE APPROACH OF THE SCOTS
HE WAS OBLIGED THEREFORE TO QUIT HIS PREY WHEN HE HAD SO NEARLY GOTTEN POSSESSION OF IT
EVERY DAY THEY ROSE IN THEIR DEMANDS
AND WHEN THE SPANISH ARMY ADVANCED TO RELIEVE IT THE COMBINED ARMIES OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND MARCHED OUT OF THEIR TRENCHES AND FOUGHT THE BATTLE OF THE DUNES WHERE THE SPANIARDS WERE TOTALLY DEFEATED HE ASPIRED TO GET POSSESSION OF ELSINORE AND THE PASSAGE OF THE SOUND
FOREIGN MINISTERS WERE FORWARD IN PAYING HIM THE USUAL COMPLIMENTS
PRINCE RUPERT HAVING LOST A GREAT PART OF HIS SQUADRON ON THE COAST OF SPAIN MADE SAIL TOWARDS THE WEST INDIES
VERY FREE TOPICS WERE ADVANCED WITH THE GENERAL APPROBATION OF THE HOUSE
HE MADE PEACE WITH THE TWO CROWNS AGAINST WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO WAGED A WAR ENTERED INTO WITHOUT NECESSITY AND CONDUCTED WITHOUT GLORY
NO MAN IN EITHER HOUSE VENTURED TO SPEAK A WORD IN THEIR VINDICATION
AND SHOULD BLINDLY TRUST HIS ENEMIES FOR THE CONDITIONS WHICH THEY WERE AFTERWARDS TO GRANT HIM
CROMWELL HIMSELF WHEN INFORMED OF HIS ELECTION FEIGNED SURPRISE AND PRETENDED AT FIRST TO HESITATE WITH REGARD TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMMAND
DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
BUT ON CONDITION THAT THESE MEMBERS SHOULD SIGN AN APPROBATION OF WHATEVER HAD BEEN DONE IN THEIR ABSENCE WITH REGARD TO THE KING'S TRIAL
AND HE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THESE ENTERPRISES
AND HE ORDERED HIS PROCLAMATION FOR THAT PURPOSE TO BE PUBLICLY READ BY THE CLERGY AFTER DIVINE SERVICE THOSE WHO WERE PURITANICALLY AFFECTED REFUSED OBEDIENCE AND WERE PUNISHED BY SUSPENSION OR DEPRIVATION
THAT TO VENTURE HIS LIFE FOR HIS SOVEREIGN WAS THE LEAST PART OF HIS MERIT
GO ON VIGOROUSLY TO LEVY SHIP MONEY
BUT HIS MAGNANIMITY UNDERVALUED DANGER
BUT WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO SUBMIT
HAVE THE ESTATES AND LIVES OF THREE NATIONS AS MUCH AT HIS DISPOSAL AS WAS ONCE THE LITTLE INHERITANCE OF HIS FATHER AND BE AS NOBLE AND LIBERAL IN THE SPENDING OF THEM
AND HE MET WITH THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE COMMONS IN WHICH HIS ENEMY WAS REPRESENTED AS THE CAUSE OF EVERY NATIONAL GRIEVANCE AND AS THE GREAT ENEMY OF THE PUBLIC
THE SENTENCE PRONOUNCED UPON HIM BY THE PEERS WAS THAT HE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE HOUSE BE FINED A THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE KING MAKE SUBMISSION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS OFFENCE BE SUSPENDED DURING THREE YEARS BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING ANY ECCLESIASTICAL DIGNITY OR SECULAR OFFICE AND THAT HIS BOOK BE CALLED IN AND BURNT PARLIAMENT
THERE APPEARS NO DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THEM WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED HOW CRUDE AND UNDIGESTED A SYSTEM OF CIVIL POLITY THEY ENDEAVORED TO ESTABLISH
ON THAT DAY THE PREACHERS AFTER MANY POLITICAL PRAYERS TOOK CARE TO TREAT OF THE REIGNING DIVISIONS IN THE PARLIAMENT AND ASCRIBED THEM ENTIRELY TO THE SELFISH ENDS PURSUED BY THE MEMBERS
SOME IRREGULAR ACTS OF THAT COUNCIL WERE THIS YEAR COMPLAINED OF 1633 THE COURT OF STAR CHAMBER EXTENDED ITS AUTHORITY
AND BESIDE THE NOBILITY EMPLOYED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KINGDOM IT CONTAINED TWICE AS MANY MEMBERS AS COMMONLY VOTED AT WESTMINSTER
THAT SO REMARKABLE A CONCURRENCE COULD PROCEED ONLY FROM THE IMMEDIATE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

WHILE SIR RICHARD DULLER AND SIR ALEXANDER CAREW LAY AT LAUNCESTON AND EMPLOYED THEMSELVES IN EXECUTING THE PARLIAMENT'S ORDINANCE FOR THE MILITIA A MEETING OF THE COUNTY WAS ASSEMBLED AT TRURO
BERMUDAS ANTIGUA AND VIRGINIA WERE SOON SUBDUED
AND INDEPENDENT OF THE GREAT INTEREST TAKEN IN IT BY THE NATION AS THE SUPPOSED PRODUCTION OF THEIR MURDERED SOVEREIGN IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THE BEST PROSE COMPOSITION WHICH AT THE TIME OF ITS PUBLICATION WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
THESE WERE NOT TO BE DIMINISHED WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE PROTECTOR
BEING FREED FOR SOME TIME FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT OF THIS ASSEMBLY CHARLES BEGAN TO LOOK TOWARDS FOREIGN WARS WHERE ALL HIS EFFORTS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL AS IN HIS DOMESTIC GOVERNMENT
THEY NAMED A COUNCIL OF STATE THIRTY-EIGHT IN NUMBER TO WHOM ALL ADDRESSES WERE MADE WHO GAVE ORDERS TO ALL GENERALS AND ADMIRALS WHO EXECUTED THE LAWS AND WHO DIGESTED ALL BUSINESS BEFORE IT WAS INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT THEY PRETENDED TO EMPLOY THEMSELVES ENTIRELY IN ADJUSTING THE LAWS FORMS AND PLAN OF A NEW REPRESENTATIVE
AFTER THIS DECLARATION IT BEHOVED THE PARLIAMENT TO RETRACT THEIR VOTE INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE SCOTTISH NATION TO SURRENDER HIM WAS BROUGHT TO THE KING
AFTER A SHARP ACTION HE WAS TOTALLY ROUTED AND FLYING WITH A FEW HORSE ESCAPED TO BRISTOL
THE GREATER PART DISDAINED TO LEND THEIR AUTHORITY TO SUCH APPARENT USURPATIONS

UPON APPLICATION THEREFORE OF THE SERVANTS AND APPRENTICES THE PARLIAMENT APPOINTED THE SECOND TUESDAY OF EVERY MONTH FOR PLAY AND RECREATION
AND THOUGH HE WAS CONSTRAINED TO ADJOURN THE PARLIAMENT BY REASON OF THE PLAGUE WHICH AT THAT TIME RAGED IN LONDON HE IMMEDIATELY REASSEMBLED THEM AT OXFORD AND MADE A NEW ATTEMPT TO GAIN FROM THEM SOME SUPPLIES IN SUCH AN URGENT NECESSITY
THOUGH THE PACIFIC AND NOT UNSKILFUL GOVERNMENT OF JAMES AND THE GREAT AUTHORITY WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED HAD MUCH ALLAYED THE FEUDS AMONG THE GREAT FAMILIES AND HAD ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM THE SCOTTISH NOBILITY WERE STILL POSSESSED OF THE CHIEF POWER AND INFLUENCE OVER THE PEOPLE
AND UPON THE WHOLE IT SEEMS HARD TO INTERPRET THAT CONDUCT WHICH OUGHT TO EXALT OUR IDEA OF HIS PRUDENCE AS A DISPARAGEMENT OF HIS PROBITY
FOR HE GAVE THE LIE AND WROTE A CHALLENGE TO LORD DARCY
YET NEVERTHELESS OF LATE DIVERS COMMISSIONS DIRECTED TO SUNDRY COMMISSIONERS IN SEVERAL COUNTIES WITH INSTRUCTIONS HAVE ISSUED
AND CONTRARY TO HER ORDERS HE BURIED HER WITH GREAT POMP IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY
MUCH MORE THAT EXTENSIVE POWER WHICH THE KING'S INDULGENCE ENCOURAGED THE PRELATES TO ASSUME
AND THE SENTENCES WERE COMPLAINED OF AS ILLEGAL
THE ONLY SOLID SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN INDEPENDENT FACTION WHICH THOUGH IT FORMED SO SMALL A PART OF THE NATION HAD VIOLENTLY USURPED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE WHOLE WAS A NUMEROUS ARMY OF NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND MEN
HE WAS CASED IN COMPLETE ARMOR BUT WAS SHOT THROUGH THE EYE BY A RANDOM BALL
BUT RECEIVED FOR ANSWER THAT THE GENERAL DESIRED HIM TO COMMUNICATE HIS BUSINESS TO MORRICE
THE GENEROUS FAIRFAX NOT CONTENT WITH BEING ABSENT FROM THE TRIAL HAD USED ALL THE INTEREST WHICH HE YET RETAINED TO PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF THE FATAL SENTENCE
AND ONE GOODMAN A JESUIT WHO WAS FOUND IN PRISON WAS CONDEMNED TO A CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
AND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR A GLOOMY ENTHUSIAST TO CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT A STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE ONE WOULD ATONE FOR ANY VIOLATION OF THE OTHER
SOME VIEWS OF POLICY MIGHT MOVE HIM TO THIS UNDERTAKING
AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION
THE ENGLISH PRESBYTERIANS HAVING NO WARNING GIVEN THEM OF THE KING'S APPROACH WERE NOT PREPARED TO JOIN HIM
NOTE N P
THE COMMONS NOW LEVELLED AGAINST THEM THEIR FORMIDABLE CENSURES AND MADE THEM THE OBJECTS OF DAILY INVECTIVE AND DECLAMATION
CROMWELL ALSO PASSED OVER WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY
THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED WITHOUT SCRUPLE THAT HE HAD A TRUST COMMITTED TO HIM AND ONE MOST SACRED AND INVIOLABLE
CLARENDON

CLARENDON

AND IT WAS MERELY BY AN HEROIC EFFORT OF DUTY THAT HE BROUGHT HIS MIND IMPATIENT OF SUPERIORITY AND EVEN OF EQUALITY TO PAY SUCH UNLIMITED SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF HIS SOVEREIGN

IT WILL CARRY YOU FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN
THE HIGH ADMIRALS THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AND THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND
AFTER SOME DELIBERATION AN ACT OF COUNCIL WAS PASSED IMPORTING THAT AS THE URGENCY OF AFFAIRS ADMITTED NOT THE WAY OF PARLIAMENT THE MOST SPEEDY EQUAL AND CONVENIENT METHOD OF SUPPLY WAS BY A GENERAL LOAN FROM THE SUBJECT ACCORDING AS EVERY MAN WAS ASSESSED IN THE ROLLS OF THE LAST SUBSIDY
BUT AS THE POWER OF INVADING IT STILL REMAINED IN THE PRINCE NO SOONER DID AN OPPORTUNITY OFFER THAN HE TOTALLY DISREGARDED ALL LAWS AND PRECEDING ENGAGEMENTS AND MADE HIS WILL AND PLEASURE THE SOLE RULE OF GOVERNMENT
IN ORDER TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF HIS CONVERSION HE INFORMED PRINCE RUPERT OF THE LOOSE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY'S QUARTERS AND EXHORTED HIM TO FORM SOME ATTEMPT UPON THEM
FOR HOW OTHERWISE SHALL THEY BE KNOWN
A WAR OF THIRTY YEARS THE MOST SIGNAL AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE THAT HAD APPEARED IN MODERN ANNALS WAS AT LAST FINISHED IN GERMANY AND BY THE TREATY OF WESTPHALIA WERE COMPOSED THOSE FATAL QUARRELS WHICH HAD BEEN EXCITED BY THE PALATINE'S PRECIPITATE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CROWN OF BOHEMIA
THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY AND WITH A VIOLENT AFFECTION FOR WHATEVER WAS MOST OPPOSITE TO THESE OBJECTS OF AVERSION
AND HAD LEARNED THAT EVEN THE COMMONS WHOSE AUTHORITY WAS PRETENDED WERE SUBDUED BY LAWLESS FORCE AND WERE BEREAVED OF THEIR LIBERTY
AND UNDER PRETENCE OF LIKE RETALIATIONS BUT REALLY FROM THE EXTREME ANIMOSITY OF THE PARTIES WERE SUCH IRREGULARITIES CONTINUED DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE WAR CLARENDON VOL
BY A STEADY PROSECUTION OF WISE PLANS BOTH OF WAR AND POLICY IT GRADUALLY GAINED AN ASCENDANT OVER THE RIVAL POWER OF SPAIN
THEY CARRIED UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HERBERT ATTORNEY-GENERAL FOR OBEYING HIS MASTER'S COMMANDS IN ACCUSING THEIR MEMBERS AND THEY PROSECUTED WITH FRESH VIGOR THEIR PLAN OF THE MILITIA ON WHICH THEY RESTED ALL FUTURE HOPES OF AN UNCONTROLLED AUTHORITY
THESE WERE THE REASONS FOR EMBRACING THAT RESOLUTION FATAL AS IT WAS EVER ESTEEMED TO THE ROYAL PARTY THE GOVERNOR OF GLOUCESTER WAS ONE MASSEY A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WHO BEFORE HE ENGAGED WITH THE PARLIAMENT HAD OFFERED HIS SERVICE TO THE KING
HEARNE HAS PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM A MANUSCRIPT WORK OF SIR SIMON D'EWES WHO WAS NO MEAN MAN IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY
SO LITTLE REGARD WAS NOW PAID TO ROYAL AUTHORITY OR TO THE ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM
CLARE AND LOVELACE HAD FOLLOWED THEM NORTHUMBERLAND HAD RETIRED TO HIS COUNTRY SEAT

OF ALL THE KING'S MINISTERS NO ONE WAS SO OBNOXIOUS IN THIS RESPECT AS THE LORD KEEPER FINCH
DON DIEGO DIAGUES THE SPANISH ADMIRAL ORDERED ALL HIS SMALLER VESSELS TO MOOR CLOSE TO THE SHORE AND POSTED THE LARGER GALLEONS FARTHER OFF AT ANCHOR WITH THEIR BROADSIDES TO THE SEA
AND NONE OF THE BYSTANDERS COULD PERCEIVE THAT THE LETTER WHICH HE PERUSED HAD BROUGHT HIM NEWS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
BUT THE QUEEN REGENT ANXIOUS FOR THE FATE OF HER BROTHER EMPLOYED HER AUTHORITY WITH THE CARDINAL TO STOP THE PROGRESS OF THE FRENCH CONQUESTS AND PUT AN END TO A QUARREL WHICH BEING COMMENCED BY AMBITION AND ATTENDED WITH VICTORY WAS AT LAST CONCLUDED WITH MODERATION
THIS IS THE BEST OF CROMWELL'S WRETCHED COMPOSITIONS THAT REMAINS AND WE SHALL HERE EXTRACT A PASSAGE OUT OF IT
THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT NORTON'S MRS LANE PRETENDED THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG AS HER SERVANT A POOR LAD A NEIGHBORING FARMER'S SON WHO WAS ILL OF AN AGUE
AND ONE PRINCIPAL GROUND OF THAT ENMITY WHICH THE PURITANS PROFESSED AGAINST HIM WAS THIS TACIT TOLERATION
AND THAT KINGS THEMSELVES ACTED BUT IN TRUST FROM THAT COMMUNITY WHICH HAD INVESTED THIS HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE WITH ITS JURISDICTION
THOSE NUMBERLESS PRODUCTIONS WITH WHICH THE PRESS THEN ABOUNDED
HE DEFENDED RAGLAN CASTLE TO EXTREMITY
AND THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED
AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
THEY WERE MADE THE FOUNDATION OF DEMANDS STILL MORE EXORBITANT
WHEN HE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE OF ANY MURMURS AMONG THE SOLDIERS HE WOULD PROSTRATE HIMSELF IN PRAYER AND COULD HARDLY BE PREVAILED WITH TO JOIN THE TROOPS
MANY THOUSANDS OF THESE TUMULTUARY PEASANTS WERE ASSEMBLED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF ENGLAND
THE SCOTS MIGHT PRETEND THAT AS CHARLES WAS KING OF SCOTLAND AS WELL AS OF ENGLAND THEY WERE ENTITLED TO AN EQUAL VOTE IN THE DISPOSAL OF HIS PERSON
THE KING WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS OXFORD IN ORDER TO RAISE THE SIEGE WHICH HE APPREHENDED WAS NOW BEGUN
THAT NUMEROUS ARMY WHICH WITH SO MUCH PAINS AND DIFFICULTY THE LORD LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN COLLECTING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WAS DISPERSED IN A MOMENT
AND SHALL WE THINK THIS A WAY TO BREAK A PARLIAMENT
WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN
FROM THIS FOUNDATION A PANIC FEAR OF POPERY WAS EASILY RAISED
IN THIS NOTABLE ASSEMBLY WERE SOME PERSONS OF THE RANK OF GENTLEMEN
HE HAD THROWN INTO THE TOWER LORD LOUDON COMMISSIONER FROM THE COVENANTERS ONE OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD SIGNED THE TREASONABLE LETTER AND HE NOW LAID THE MATTER BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT WHOM HE HOPED TO INFLAME BY THE RESENTMENT AND ALARM BY THE DANGER OF THIS APPLICATION TO A FOREIGN POWER
BUT COMMON SENSE REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD BE REGARDED AS ONE AND THE SAME
THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS NOW POSSESSED OF SUPREME AUTHORITY DELIBERATED WHAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT THEY SHOULD ESTABLISH
AND HOW COULD SUCH A PLAN BE SUPPORTED IN OPPOSITION TO ENGLAND POSSESSED OF SUCH NUMEROUS AND VICTORIOUS ARMIES WHICH WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST SEEMED TO BE IN ENTIRE UNION WITH THE PARLIAMENT
THAT TOWN WAS WELL FORTIFIED
WE MUST NOT OMIT ANOTHER AUXILIARY OF THE COVENANTERS AND NO INCONSIDERABLE ONE
BUT THESE IRREGULARITIES WERE DEEMED INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ILLEGAL AUTHORITY
THIS COMMAND IN A COMMONWEALTH WHICH STOOD ENTIRELY BY ARMS WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
BY TOBIAS SMOLLETT
1147
AS THE KING HAD REALLY SO LOW AN OPINION OF GLAMORGAN'S UNDERSTANDING IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE WOULD TRUST HIM WITH THE SOLE MANAGEMENT OF SO IMPORTANT AND DELICATE A TREATY
IN SHORT IF WE TAKE A SURVEY OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THIS MEMORABLE PARLIAMENT DURING THE FIRST PERIOD OF ITS OPERATIONS WE SHALL FIND THAT EXCEPTING STRAFFORD'S ATTAINDER WHICH WAS A COMPLICATION OF CRUEL INIQUITY THEIR MERITS IN OTHER RESPECTS SO MUCH OUTWEIGH THEIR MISTAKES AS TO ENTITLE THEM TO PRAISE FROM ALL LOVERS OF LIBERTY
IN OPPOSITION TO THE SACRED AUTHORITY OF THE LAWS TO THE VENERABLE PRECEDENTS OF MANY AGES THE POPULAR LEADERS WERE ASHAMED TO PLEAD NOTHING BUT FEARS AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NOT AVOWED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND FOR WHICH NEITHER THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF CHARLES SO FULL OF VIRTUE NOR HIS SITUATION SO DEPRIVED OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY SEEMED TO AFFORD ANY REASONABLE FOUNDATION
IN ORDER TO EQUIP A FLEET A DISTRIBUTION BY ORDER OF COUNCIL WAS MADE TO ALL THE MARITIME TOWNS
A LITTLE BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THIS FRUITLESS TREATY A DEED WAS EXECUTED BY THE PARLIAMENT WHICH PROVED THEIR DETERMINED RESOLUTION TO YIELD NOTHING BUT TO PROCEED IN THE SAME VIOLENT AND IMPERIOUS MANNER WITH WHICH THEY HAD AT FIRST ENTERED ON THESE DANGEROUS ENTERPRISES
BUT CROMWELL PRETENDED THAT A MONTH CONTAINED ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT DAYS ACCORDING TO THE METHOD OF COMPUTATION PRACTISED IN PAYING THE FLEET AND ARMY
BUT THEY WERE AWAKENED FROM THEIR SECURITY ON THE VERY DAY BEFORE THAT WHICH WAS APPOINTED FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES
THE DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES ON BOTH SIDES WAS AS FOLLOWS
THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE
BUT AFTER THE COMMONS DURING THE PRECEDENT SESSION HAD REMEDIED ALL THESE GRIEVANCES BY MEANS OF THEIR PETITION OF RIGHT WHICH THEY DEEMED SO NECESSARY THEY AFTERWARDS PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE MATTER INTO CONSIDERATION AND THEY SHOWED THE SAME INTENTION AS FORMERLY OF EXACTING IN RETURN FOR THE GRANT OF THIS REVENUE VERY LARGE COMPLIANCES ON THE PART OF THE CROWN
IT HAS LAIN CONCEALED UNDER WATER

THAT ADMITTING THOSE EXTRAVAGANT PRINCIPLES WHICH LEVELLED ALL ORDERS OF MEN THE COURT COULD PLEAD NO POWER DELEGATED BY THE PEOPLE
THIS GENERAL CAST OF THOUGHT WHICH HAS MORE OR LESS PREVAILED IN ENGLAND DURING NEAR A CENTURY AND A HALF AND WHICH HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MUCH GOOD AND MUCH ILL IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS NEVER PREDOMINATED MORE THAN DURING THE REIGN OF CHARLES
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THIS LIFE IS DEDICATED OR ADDRESSED TO YOUNG STRAFFORD
TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS WOULD SHOCK THE LEAST DELICATE HUMANITY
261
261
THEY NOW CONSIDERED THEMSELVES ENTIRELY AS A REPUBLIC AND MADE NO ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHORITY OF THEIR PRINCE WHICH THEY HAD UTTERLY ANNIHILATED
THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS TO CLEAR UP THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION TO MARK THE BOUNDARIES OF THE POWERS INTRUSTED BY LAW TO THE SEVERAL MEMBERS TO SHOW WHAT GREAT IMPROVEMENTS THE WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM HAD RECEIVED FROM THE KING'S LATE CONCESSIONS TO DEMONSTRATE HIS ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS PEOPLE AND HIS RELIANCE ON THEIR AFFECTIONS TO POINT OUT THE UNGRATEFUL RETURNS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE HIM AND THE ENORMOUS ENCROACHMENTS INSULTS AND INDIGNITIES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED
NOTHING MORE CERTAIN REPLIED THE PREACHER
HOW CHEERFUL THE KING WAS HOW PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE THAT APPROACHED HIM HOW SATISFIED IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION AS IF THE VIEW OF SUCH BENIGNITY AND CONSTANCY HAD NOT BEEN MORE PROPER TO INFLAME THAN ALLAY THE GENERAL COMPASSION OF THE PEOPLE
THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO WHICH THE PARLIAMENT WAS THEN REDUCED ALLOWED THEM NO LEISURE TO EXAMINE STRICTLY THE REASONS WHICH HE GAVE FOR QUITTING HIS STATION
BUT THE SUCCEEDING PARLIAMENT EXCITED DOUBTS IN EVERY ONE
AFTER DEBATES ON THIS SUBJECT THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT COULD FALL UNDER THE DISCUSSION OF HUMAN CREATURES LUDLOW TELLS US THAT CROMWELL BY WAY OF FROLIC THREW A CUSHION AT HIS HEAD
CONFERENCE HELD AT WHITEHALL
A DISPOSITION WHICH IF CONFINED TO THE ARMY MAY BE REGARDED AS A GOOD PRESAGE OF VICTORY
AND THE FAMOUS CURSE OF MEROZ THAT CURSE SO SOLEMNLY DENOUNCED AND REITERATED AGAINST NEUTRALITY AND MODERATION RESOUNDED FROM ALL QUARTERS RUSH VOL
THE WEAKER SEX THEMSELVES NATURALLY TENDER TO THEIR OWN SUFFERINGS AND COMPASSIONATE TO THOSE OF OTHERS HERE EMULATED THEIR MORE ROBUST COMPANIONS IN THE PRACTICE OF EVERY CRUELTY EVEN CHILDREN TAUGHT BY THE EXAMPLE AND ENCOURAGED BY THE EXHORTATION OF THEIR PARENTS ESSAYED THEIR FEEBLE BLOWS ON THE DEAD CARCASSES OR DEFENCELESS CHILDREN OF THE ENGLISH.[V TEMPLE P
BUT WERE STILL HINDERED BY MANY PREJUDICES FROM ENTERING INTO A CORDIAL UNION WITH HIS LIEUTENANT

THOUGH THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED THE CONVOCATION WAS STILL ALLOWED TO SIT
BUT IF IT EXTEND TO THE GENERAL IS THE MOST PROBABLE FORERUNNER OF A DEFEAT
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE KINGDOM TO REMAIN LONG IN THIS DOUBTFUL SITUATION
AFTER THE LEGAL CONCESSIONS MADE BY THE LATE KING THE CONSTITUTION SEEMED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SECURED
AFTER STRAFFORD FELL A VICTIM TO POPULAR RAGE THE HUMORS EXCITED IN IRELAND BY THAT GREAT EVENT COULD NOT SUDDENLY BE COMPOSED BUT CONTINUED TO PRODUCE THE GREATEST INNOVATIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT
IT APPEARS THAT SIR PHELIM O'NEALE CHIEFLY AND HE ONLY AT FIRST PROMOTED THAT IMPOSTURE
PERHAPS TOO IT HAD PARTLY PROCEEDED FROM EXPECTATIONS OF THIS NATURE THAT THE POPULAR LEADERS HAD BEEN SO URGENT FOR A RUPTURE WITH SPAIN
THE KING WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE PROPOSALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF THE PARLIAMENT COULD NOT EXPECT ANY ACCOMMODATION AND HAD NO PROSPECT BUT OF WAR OR OF TOTAL SUBMISSION AND SUBJECTION
AND ABOVE THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS WERE LEVIED BY THAT EXPEDIENT LIKE COMPOSITIONS OR IN DEFAULT OF THEM HEAVY FINES WERE REQUIRED FOR ENCROACHMENTS ON THE KING'S FORESTS WHOSE BOUNDS BY DECREES DEEMED ARBITRARY WERE EXTENDED MUCH BEYOND WHAT WAS USUAL THE BOUNDS OF ONE FOREST THAT OF ROCKINGHAM WERE INCREASED FROM SIX MILES TO SIXTY.[V THE SAME REFRACTORY HUMOR WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE REFUSE TO THE KING VOLUNTARY SUPPLIES DISPOSED THEM WITH BETTER REASON TO MURMUR AGAINST THESE IRREGULAR METHODS OF TAXATION
AS HE OFTEN PASSED THROUGH THE HANDS OF CATHOLICS THE PRIESTS HOLE AS THEY CALLED IT THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE OBLIGED TO CONCEAL THEIR PERSECUTED PRIESTS WAS SOMETIMES EMPLOYED FOR SHELTERING THEIR DISTRESSED SOVEREIGN
287
AND THEREBY RENEW ALL THE OPPOSITION WHICH WITH SO MUCH DIFFICULTY HE HAD SURMOUNTED IN LEVYING THAT TAXATION
THAT SCARCELY ANY ARGUMENT MORE UNFAVORABLE COULD BE PLEADED FOR SUPPLY THAN AN OFFER TO ABOLISH SHIP MONEY
FINDING THAT FAIRFAX ASSISTED BY HOTHAM AND THE GARRISON OF HULL WAS MAKING PROGRESS IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF YORKSHIRE HE ADVANCED WITH A BODY OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN AND TOOK POSSESSION OF YORK
THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM
THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
IN THIS SITUATION PRINCE RUPERT ON HIS RETURN FOUND AFFAIRS
ELATED BY THE NUMEROUS SUCCESSES WHICH THEY HAD OBTAINED OVER THEIR DOMESTIC ENEMIES THEY THOUGHT THAT EVERY THING MUST YIELD TO THEIR FORTUNATE ARMS
POOR SOULS SAID THE KING TO ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS FOR A LITTLE MONEY THEY WOULD DO AS MUCH AGAINST THEIR COMMANDERS SOME OF THEM WERE PERMITTED TO GO THE UTMOST LENGTH OF BRUTAL INSOLENCE AND TO SPIT IN HIS FACE AS HE WAS CONDUCTED ALONG THE PASSAGE TO THE COURT
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IS NECESSARY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE SO MEMORABLE
THE EARL OF ORMOND THEIR GENERAL REMONSTRATED AGAINST SUCH TIMID NOT TO SAY BASE AND INTERESTED COUNSELS
TUMULTS WERE DAILY RAISED
THE ABOLITION OF THE COUNCIL OF THE NORTH AND THE COUNCIL OF WALES FOLLOWED FROM THE SAME PRINCIPLES
BESIDES THE GREAT GENIUS AND AUTHORITY OF THAT MINISTER HE HAD THREATENED SOME OF THE POPULAR LEADERS WITH AN IMPEACHMENT
THOUGH IT WAS RESOLVED NOT TO TREAT THIS HOUSE OF PEERS WITH ANY GREATER RESPECT THAN THEY SHOULD RETURN TO THE COMMONS
IT IS THUS RELATED BY MR MAURICE CHAPLAIN TO ROGER EARL OF ORRERY

AND THE SECTARIES RESOLVED TO GRATIFY THEIR VENGEANCE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS PRELATE WHO HAD SO LONG BY HIS AUTHORITY AND BY THE EXECUTION OF PENAL LAWS KEPT THEIR ZEALOUS SPIRIT UNDER CONFINEMENT
OR SPEAK OF GIVING TILL WE KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE ANY THING TO GIVE
AND HAVING CLOTHED THE KING IN A GARB LIKE THEIR OWN THEY LED HIM INTO THE NEIGHBORING WOOD PUT A BILL IN HIS HAND AND PRETENDED TO EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN CUTTING FAGOTS
ON THE OTHER HAND SOME WHO DREADED THE INCREASING POWER OF CROMWELL EXPECTED THAT THE GREAT EXPENSE OF NAVAL ARMAMENTS WOULD PROVE A MOTIVE FOR DIMINISHING THE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
THE REVENUE WHICH NEVER BEFORE ANSWERED THE CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT WAS NOW RAISED TO BE EQUAL TO THEM A SMALL STANDING ARMY FORMERLY KEPT IN NO ORDER WAS AUGMENTED AND WAS GOVERNED BY EXACT DISCIPLINE
BUT HE DID WORSE THAN EMBRACE THE WORST SIDE
AND THE PRINCE BESIDES ONE NEGATIVE AFTER THE BILLS HAD PASSED THROUGH PARLIAMENT POSSESSED INDIRECTLY ANOTHER BEFORE THEIR INTRODUCTION
AND PARTLY FROM THE ASCENDANT OF HIS MAGNANIMOUS SPIRIT PARTLY FROM THE SITUATION OF FOREIGN KINGDOMS THE WEIGHT OF ENGLAND EVEN UNDER ITS MOST LEGAL AND BRAVEST PRINCES WAS NEVER MORE SENSIBLY FELT THAN DURING THIS UNJUST AND VIOLENT USURPATION
IT TAUGHT THAT THOUGH PROPERTY WAS COMMONLY LODGED IN THE SUBJECT YET WHENEVER ANY EXIGENCY REQUIRED SUPPLY ALL PROPERTY WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE SOVEREIGN
ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM SOME INTRIGUES OF THE COURT AND SOME DISCONTENTS IN THE COURTS OF JUDICATURE INTESTINE COMMOTIONS WERE EXCITED AND EVERY THING RELAPSED INTO CONFUSION
LORD KEEPER LITTLETON AFTER SENDING THE GREAT SEAL BEFORE HIM HAD FLED TO YORK
AND THAT THEY WHO WERE THE AUTHORS OF LIBERTY TO THE NATION WERE REDUCED BY A FACTION IN PARLIAMENT TO THE MOST GRIEVOUS SERVITUDE
AND COMMISSIONERS FIVE PEERS AND TEN COMMONERS WERE SENT TO NEWPORT IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT IN ORDER TO TREAT WITH THE KING HE WAS ALLOWED TO SUMMON SEVERAL OF HIS FRIENDS AND OLD COUNSELLORS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE THEIR ADVICE IN THIS IMPORTANT TRANSACTION THE THEOLOGIANS ON BOTH SIDES ARMED WITH THEIR SYLLOGISMS AND QUOTATIONS ATTENDED AS AUXILIARIES BY THEM THE FLAME HAD FIRST BEEN RAISED
76
AND IF THE QUESTION BE CONSIDERED IN THE VIEW OF POLICY THOUGH A SECT ALREADY FORMED AND ADVANCED MAY WITH GOOD REASON DEMAND A TOLERATION WHAT TITLE HAD THE PURITANS TO THIS INDULGENCE WHO WERE JUST ON THE POINT OF SEPARATION FROM THE CHURCH AND WHOM IT MIGHT BE HOPED SOME WHOLESOME AND LEGAL SEVERITIES WOULD STILL RETAIN IN OBEDIENCE 15 NALSON VOL
SECRET MEETINGS WERE HELD BY THEM IN CAVES AND UNDER GROUND IN SURREY

THE PARLIAMENT WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE SOME APPROACHES IN ONE PROVINCE TO THEIR INDEPENDENT MODEL
SEE ON THE ONE HAND TOLAND'S AMYNTOR AND ON THE OTHER WAGATAFFE'S VINDICATION OF THE ROYAL MARTYR WITH YOUNG'S ADDITION
BUT YOUR FRIENDS THE ROUNDHEADS HAVE THE VICES OF DEVILS--TYRANNY REBELLION AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE RIOT AND DISORDER IT IS CERTAIN NOTWITHSTANDING THE GOOD EXAMPLE SET THEM BY CHARLES I PREVAILED VERY MUCH AMONG HIS PARTISANS
TWO IMPORTANT POINTS REMAINED TO BE SETTLED WITH THAT NATION
AND HE NEVER WOULD DESIST TILL HE HAD TOTALLY EXTERMINATED THE ROYAL FAMILY
AND IN ORDER TO ENGAGE THAT NATION IN THIS UNDERTAKING BESIDES GIVING A PROMISE OF PAY THEY AGREED TO PUT CARICFERGUS INTO THEIR HANDS AND TO INVEST THEIR GENERAL WITH AN AUTHORITY QUITE INDEPENDENT OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT
HE DELIVERED ONLY A VERBAL MESSAGE BY GRANVILLE ASSURING THE KING OF HIS SERVICES GIVING ADVICE FOR HIS CONDUCT AND EXHORTING HIM INSTANTLY TO LEAVE THE SPANISH TERRITORIES AND RETIRE INTO HOLLAND
HE GAVE ORDERS HOWEVER TO SUPPORT IT BY MEN AND MONEY
ELIZABETH BORN 1635
THE COUNCIL AT EDINBURGH ALARMED AT MONTROSE'S PROGRESS BEGAN TO THINK OF A MORE REGULAR PLAN OF DEFENCE AGAINST AN ENEMY WHOSE REPEATED VICTORIES HAD RENDERED HIM EXTREMELY FORMIDABLE
AND MANY PRAYERS BEING SAID THE SOLEMNITY OF THE CONSECRATION ENDED
IN DIFFERENT PERIODS OF ENGLISH STORY THERE OCCUR INSTANCES OF THEIR REMONSTRATING WITH THEIR PRINCES IN THE FREEST MANNER AND SOMETIMES OF THEIR REFUSING SUPPLY WHEN DISGUSTED WITH ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF PUBLIC CONDUCT
FOR THIS REASON HE SOLICITED A TREATY ON ALL OCCASIONS AND DESIRED A CONFERENCE AND MUTUAL EXAMINATION OF PRETENSIONS EVEN WHEN HE ENTERTAINED NO HOPES THAT ANY CONCLUSION COULD POSSIBLY RESULT FROM IT
AND AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AGREEABLE TO THE GENERAL IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED BY THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS
339 RUSHWORTH VOL
HE WAS EVEN RESOLVED TO LIMIT EXTREMELY THE POWER OF THE BISHOPS AND WAS CONTENT IF ON ANY TERMS HE COULD RETAIN THAT ORDER IN THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND AND TO INSURE ALL THESE GRACIOUS OFFERS HE GAVE HAMILTON AUTHORITY TO SUMMON FIRST AN ASSEMBLY THEN A PARLIAMENT WHERE EVERY NATIONAL GRIEVANCE MIGHT BE REDRESSED AND REMEDIED
AND STILL MORE WHERE IT ENCOUNTERS RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES
HE HOPED THAT THEIR HORROR AGAINST POPERY A RELIGION WHICH NOW APPEARED IN ITS MOST HORRIBLE ASPECT WOULD SECOND ALL HIS EXHORTATIONS
TO WHICH WE MAY SUBJOIN THAT IF MEN WERE AS MUCH DISPOSED TO JUDGE OF THIS PRINCE'S ACTIONS WITH CANDOR AS SEVERITY THIS PRECAUTION OF ENTERING A PROTEST IN HIS COUNCIL BOOKS MIGHT RATHER PASS FOR A PROOF OF SCRUPULOUS HONOR
AND THIS WAS THE LAST GLIMPSE OF SUCCESS WHICH ATTENDED HIS ARMS
A TREATY WAS SIGNED BY MONK'S COMMISSIONERS
MEN OF SUCH DARING GENIUSES WERE NOT CONTENTED WITH THE ANCIENT AND LEGAL FORMS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT
BUT BOTH THESE DEFEATS OF THE ROYALISTS WERE MORE THAN SUFFICIENTLY COMPENSATED BY THE TOTAL ROUT OF LORD FAIRFAX AT ATHERTON MOOR AND THE DISPERSION OF HIS ARMY
HE OBEYED AFTER SENDING COLONEL WELDON TO THE WEST WITH A DETACHMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND MEN
DURING THE TIME THAT ENGLAND CONTINUED IN THIS DISTRACTED CONDITION THE OTHER KINGDOMS OF EUROPE WERE HASTENING TOWARDS A COMPOSURE OF THOSE DIFFERENCES BY WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG BEEN AGITATED
1659 THE HOUSE OF PEERS OR THE OTHER HOUSE CONSISTED OF THE SAME PERSONS THAT HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY OLIVER
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST PUBLIC OPPORTUNITY WHICH HE HAD MET WITH OF DISCOVERING THE FACTIOUS ZEAL AND OBSTINACY OF HIS CHARACTER
LINDESEY THE GENERAL WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED AND TAKEN PRISONER
THE QUEEN TERRIFIED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF SO MIGHTY A DANGER AND BEARING FORMERLY NO GOOD WILL TO STRAFFORD WAS IN TEARS AND PRESSED HIM TO SATISFY HIS PEOPLE IN THIS DEMAND WHICH IT WAS HOPED WOULD FINALLY CONTENT THEM
AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN THE IGNORANT MULTITUDE
AND THE KING BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND EXAMPLE ENCOURAGED THIS LAUDABLE UNDERTAKING BY ORDER OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL ST GREGORY'S CHURCH WAS REMOVED AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE PROJECT OF EXTENDING AND BEAUTIFYING THE CATHEDRAL
THAT AMONG THESE WERE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NATION BY A SINGLE PERSON AND A PARLIAMENT THEIR JOINT AUTHORITY OVER THE ARMY AND MILITIA THE SUCCESSION OF NEW PARLIAMENTS AND LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE
HAVING LAID IN THIS STOCK OF MERIT HE EXPECTED THAT ALL HIS FORMER MISDEMEANORS WOULD BE OVERLOOKED AND FORGIVEN
THAT HOW MUCH SOEVER A STEADY UNIFORM CONDUCT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUITABLE TO THE ADVANCED AGE AND STRICT ENGAGEMENTS OF THE LATE KING NO ONE WOULD THROW ANY BLAME ON A YOUNG PRINCE FOR COMPLYING WITH CONDITIONS WHICH NECESSITY HAD EXTORTED FROM HIM
THE NAME OF FRIEND WAS THE ONLY SALUTATION WITH WHICH THEY INDISCRIMINATELY ACCOSTED EVERY ONE
WHEN THAT ASSEMBLY WAS EXPELLED BY CROMWELL CONTEMPT HAD SUCCEEDED TO HATRED
AND THOUGH HIS REAR WAS ONCE PUT IN SOME DISORDER BY AN INCURSION OF THE KING'S HORSE HE REACHED LONDON IN SAFETY AND RECEIVED APPLAUSE FOR HIS CONDUCT AND SUCCESS IN THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE
BUT TO EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE DERIVED FROM NECESSITY FROM THE JEALOUSY AND RESENTMENT OF ANTAGONISTS FROM BLAME FROM REPROACH FROM OPPOSITION MUST BE THE RESULT OF THE FONDEST AND MOST BLIND CREDULITY
BUT HE STILL MET WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS
AND THIS MAJORITY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BUT BY OUTRAGES WHICH IN THE END WOULD HAVE DRAWN DISGRACE AND RUIN ON THOSE WHO INCITED THEM
INSTANTLY HE CALLED OFF HIS SOLDIERS FROM PLUNDER PUT THEM IN ORDER SECURED HIS RETREAT BY THE MOST SKILFUL MEASURES
THE KING'S BODY OF RESERVE COMMANDED BY SIR JOHN BIRON JUDGING LIKE RAW SOLDIERS THAT ALL WAS OVER AND IMPATIENT TO HAVE SOME SHARE IN THE ACTION HEEDLESSLY FOLLOWED THE CHASE WHICH THEIR LEFT WING HAD PRECIPITATELY LED THEM
IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE COMMONS MIGHT RENEW THEIR FORMER PROJECT OF MAKING THIS REVENUE ONLY TEMPORARY AND THEREBY REDUCING THEIR PRINCE TO PERPETUAL DEPENDENCE
THE MOVEMENT OF GREAT STATES ARE OFTEN DIRECTED BY AS SLENDER SPRINGS AS THOSE OF INDIVIDUALS
PETITIONS TO PARLIAMENT WERE DRAWN CRAVING REDRESS AGAINST PARTICULAR GRIEVANCES
THAT THE KING JUDGED ARIGHT OF THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER APPEARS FROM HIS CENTURY OF ARTS OR SCANTLING OF INVENTIONS WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS COMPOUND OF HES CHIMERAS AND IMPOSSIBILITIES AND SHOWS WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A MAN
AND ALL THE JAILS IN ENGLAND WERE FILLED WITH MEN WHOM THE JEALOUSIES AND FEARS OF THE RULING PARTY HAD REPRESENTED AS DANGEROUS THE TAXES CONTINUED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND WHICH BEING UNUSUAL WERE ESTEEMED HEAVY INCREASED THE GENERAL ILL WILL UNDER WHICH IT LABORED
BUT THE EARL OF ESSEX THE PARLIAMENTARY GENERAL HAD NOT YET RECEIVED ANY ORDERS FROM HIS MASTERS CLARENDON VOL
THE COUNCIL OF STATE NAMED BY THE INSTRUMENT WERE FIFTEEN
CARRIERS WERE SEARCHED OR BRIBED
SEEING THE WINE HE LET FALL THE COVER STARTED BACK AND BOWED AS BEFORE
BUT BY THE ARTIFICE OF VANE NO DECLARATION MORE EXPLICIT WAS MADE WITH REGARD TO ENGLAND AND IRELAND THAN THAT THESE KINGDOMS SHOULD BE REFORMED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD AND THE EXAMPLE OF THE PUREST CHURCHES
THOUGH THEIR PARTISANS WERE BLINDED WITH THE THICKEST VEIL OF RELIGIOUS PREJUDICES THEY DREADED TO BRING THEIR PRETENSIONS TO THE TEST OR LAY THEM OPEN BEFORE THE WHOLE NATION
NOR WAS THE RESEMBLANCE TO THE ROMISH RITUAL ANY OBJECTION BUT RATHER A MERIT WITH LAUD AND HIS BRETHREN
1658 ALL THE ARTS OF CROMWELL'S POLICY HAD BEEN SO OFTEN PRACTISED THAT THEY BEGAN TO LOSE THEIR EFFECT
SECRET RUMORS LIKEWISE WERE HEARD OF SOME APPROACHING CONSPIRACY
THAT ASSEMBLY THEY PRETENDED NOT TO ACCUSE
MEANWHILE ALL THE SYMPTOMS BEGAN TO WEAR A MORE FATAL ASPECT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE NAMES OF ALL THE LIEUTENANTS WERE INSERTED IN THE BILL
AND JOINING HIM IN COMMAND WITH URREY WHO HAD AGAIN ENLISTED HIMSELF AMONG THE KING'S ENEMIES THEY SENT THEM TO THE FIELD WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AGAINST THE ROYALISTS
THE POST-HOUSE IN 1653 WAS FARMED AT TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WHICH WAS DEEMED A CONSIDERABLE SUM FOR THE THREE KINGDOMS
THE PROTECTOR ORDERED HIM A POMPOUS FUNERAL AT THE PUBLIC CHARGE
ALL THE KING'S FURNITURE WAS PUT TO SALE

AND EVERY PRUDENTIAL AS WELL AS MORAL PRECEPT MAY BE AUTHORIZED BY THOSE EVENTS WHICH HER ENLARGED MIRROR IS ABLE TO PRESENT TO US
IN THE DISPUTE ON THESE ARTICLES ONE IS NOT SURPRISED THAT TWO OF THE PARLIAMENTARY THEOLOGIANS SHOULD TELL THE KING THAT IF HE DID NOT CONSENT TO THE UTTER ABOLITION OF EPISCOPACY HE WOULD BE DAMNED BUT IT IS NOT WITHOUT SOME INDIGNATION THAT WE READ THE FOLLOWING VOTE OF THE LORDS AND COMMONS
MANY OFFICERS WHO HAD BEEN CASHIERED BY THE NEW MODEL OF THE ARMY OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE PARLIAMENT
17
BUT ALL THESE WERE BY THE NEW PARTY DEPRIVED OF AUTHORITY
AND AS A PREPARATIVE TO IT THERE WAS LAID BEFORE THE PRESBYTERY OF EDINBURGH AND SOLEMNLY READ IN ALL THE CHURCHES OF THE KINGDOM AN ACCUSATION AGAINST THE BISHOPS AS GUILTY ALL OF THEM OF HERESY SIMONY BRIBERY PERJURY CHEATING INCEST ADULTERY FORNICATION COMMON SWEARING DRUNKENNESS GAMING BREACH OF THE SABBATH AND EVERY OTHER CRIME THAT HAD OCCURRED TO THE ACCUSERS THE BISHOPS SENT A PROTEST DECLINING THE AUTHORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY
THE MODERATE PRESBYTERIANS WHO ENDEAVORED TO RECONCILE THE INTERESTS OF RELIGION AND OF THE CROWN
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE HARD TO GIVE THAT APPELLATION TO LAUD'S CONDUCT WHO ONLY ENFORCED THE ACT OF UNIFORMITY AND EXPELLED THE CLERGYMEN THAT ACCEPTED OF BENEFICES AND YET REFUSED TO OBSERVE THE CEREMONIES WHICH THEY PREVIOUSLY KNEW TO BE ENJOINED BY LAW
THE MEMBERS OF THIS ASSEMBLY RETURNING TO THEIR COUNTIES PROPAGATED THAT SPIRIT OF MUTINY WHICH THEY HAD EXERTED IN THE HOUSE
OTHERS WERE EXPECTED THAT NIGHT AND NEXT MORNING THEY WERE TO ENTER UPON WHAT THEY ESTEEMED THE EASIEST OF ALL ENTERPRISES THE SURPRISAL OF THE CASTLE
AS HE CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF LAND HE EXPIRED 20TH OF APRIL 1657
AND HOPTON BY THE BLOWING UP OF SOME POWDER WAS DANGEROUSLY HURT
THIS MOTION WAS RECEIVED WITH UNIVERSAL APPROBATION
IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE KING IN THIS DECLARATION TOUCHED UPON THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION WHICH IT IS MOST DIFFICULT OR RATHER ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE TO REGULATE BY LAWS AND WHICH MUST BE GOVERNED BY CERTAIN DELICATE IDEAS OF PROPRIETY AND DECENCY RATHER THAN BY ANY EXACT RULE OR PRESCRIPTION
THE PARLIAMENT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO FIND FAULT WITH EVERY MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE OPPOSITE PARTY AND WHO WOULD NOT LOSE SO FAIR AN OPPORTUNITY OF REPROACHING THE KING WITH HIS FAVOR TO THE IRISH PAPISTS EXCLAIMED LOUDLY AGAINST THIS CESSATION
THE FORMER GAINED A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE AT WAKEFIELD OVER A DETACHMENT OF ROYALISTS AND TOOK GENERAL GORING PRISONER
AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE SHALL DECLARE WHAT THE LAW OF THE LAND IS TO HAVE THIS NOT ONLY QUESTIONED BUT CONTRADICTED IS A HIGH BREACH OF THEIR PRIVILEGES THIS WAS A PLAIN ASSUMING OF THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND EXERTING IT IN THE MOST MATERIAL ARTICLE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MILITIA
820
THE TIME AND PLACE OF TREATY BEING SETTLED SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS FROM THE KING MET AT UXBRIDGE WITH TWELVE AUTHORIZED BY THE PARLIAMENT ATTENDED BY THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS
AFTER BEATING UP THE QUARTERS OF THE ROYALISTS AT BOVEY TRACY FAIRFAX SAT DOWN BEFORE DARTMOUTH AND IN A FEW DAYS ENTERED IT BY STORM
THE SWEDISH ALLIANCE THOUGH MUCH CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF ENGLAND HE HAD CONTRACTED MERELY FROM HIS ZEAL FOR PROTESTANTISM AND SWEDEN BEING CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH FRANCE HE COULD NOT HOPE TO MAINTAIN THAT CONFEDERACY IN WHICH HE SO MUCH PRIDED HIMSELF SHOULD A RUPTURE ENSUE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THIS LATTER KINGDOM SEE THE ACCOUNT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH FRANCE AND SPAIN BY THURLOE VOL
A CONDE A TURENNE WERE FORMED
PASSIVE OBEDIENCE WAS THERE RECOMMENDED IN ITS FULL EXTENT THE WHOLE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE WAS REPRESENTED AS BELONGING TO THE KING ALONE AND ALL LIMITATIONS OF LAW AND A CONSTITUTION WERE REJECTED AS SEDITIOUS AND IMPIOUS SO OPENLY WAS THIS DOCTRINE ESPOUSED BY THE COURT THAT ARCHBISHOP ABBOT A POPULAR AND VIRTUOUS PRELATE WAS BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LICENSE SIBTHORPE'S SERMON SUSPENDED FROM THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE BANISHED FROM LONDON AND CONFINED TO ONE OF HIS COUNTRY SEATS ABBOT'S PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND HIS OPPOSITION TO BUCKINGHAM HAD ALWAYS RENDERED HIM VERY UNGRACIOUS AT COURT AND HAD ACQUIRED HIM THE CHARACTER OF A PURITAN
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE POWER AND BOLDNESS TO PUT HIS PRINCE AND MASTER TO AN OPEN AND INFAMOUS DEATH
OTHERS REGARDED THAT INSTITUTION AS VENERABLE AND USEFUL
THAT THOSE WHO ARROGATED A TITLE TO SIT AS HIS JUDGES WERE BORN HIS SUBJECTS AND BORN SUBJECTS TO THOSE LAWS WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG THAT HE WAS NOT REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF SHELTERING HIMSELF UNDER THIS GENERAL MAXIM WHICH GUARDS EVERY ENGLISH MONARCH EVEN THE LEAST DESERVING
THEY FRAMED A REMONSTRANCE AND SENT FIVE AGITATORS TO PRESENT IT TO THE GENERAL AND COUNCIL OF WAR
IN OUR PRESENT CONSTITUTION MANY ACCIDENTS WHICH HAVE RENDERED GOVERNMENTS EVERY WHERE AS WELL AS IN GREAT BRITAIN MUCH MORE BURDENSOME THAN FORMERLY HAVE THROWN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CROWN THE DISPOSAL OF A LARGE REVENUE AND HAVE ENABLED THE KING BY THE PRIVATE INTEREST AND AMBITION OF THE MEMBERS TO RESTRAIN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND AMBITION OF THE BODY
THE TOWN WAS TAKEN SWORD IN HAND
THAT SENSIBLE OF THE INIQUITY OF THE SENTENCE HE PROCURED HIS MAJESTY'S FREE PARDON TO MOUNTNORRIS
AND CERTAINLY MAN BEING BACKED WITH OMNIPOTENCY IS A KIND OF OMNIPOTENT CREATURE
AND THAT HE DETESTED ALL POPERY SUPERSTITION PRELACY HERESY SCHISM AND PROFANENESS
AND SIR JOHN HOTHAM THE GOVERNOR THOUGH HE HAD ACCEPTED OF A COMMISSION FROM THE PARLIAMENT WAS NOT THOUGHT TO BE MUCH DISAFFECTED TO THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY
HE BOASTED THAT HE HAD DESTROYED THESE MONUMENTS OF IDOLATRY
MONTAGUE WAS SENT WITH A SQUADRON TO THE BALTIC AND CARRIED WITH HIM AS AMBASSADOR ALGERNON SIDNEY THE CELEBRATED REPUBLICAN
WHO EXPECTED SUDDENLY THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST UPON EARTH
THAT THE RESOLUTION PROCEEDED ONLY FROM HIMSELF AND THE IMPULSE OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE
NOR ACKNOWLEDGE THE TWO HOUSES MORE EXPRESSLY FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT
HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE TO MENTION ANY PARTICULAR SUM WHICH MIGHT BE EXPECTED BY HIM SECURE OF THE AFFECTIONS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED THAT THEIR BOUNTY SHOULD BE ENTIRELY THEIR OWN DEED
THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH STRONGLY INVITED THE NATIVES OF IRELAND TO EMBRACE THE KING'S PARTY
I HAVE TO-DAY ACQUIRED ENOUGH BESIDE PRINCE RUPERT SENSIBLE TOO LATE OF HIS ERROR LEFT THE FRUITLESS ATTACK ON THE ENEMY'S ARTILLERY AND JOINED THE KING WHOSE INFANTRY WAS NOW TOTALLY DISCOMFITED
BUT IF HIS CONDUCT WAS DERIVED IN A GREAT MEASURE FROM NECESSITY AND FROM A NATURAL DESIRE OF DEFENDING THAT PREROGATIVE WHICH WAS TRANSMITTED TO HIM FROM HIS ANCESTORS AND WHICH HIS PARLIAMENTS WERE VISIBLY ENCROACHING ON THERE IS NO REASON WHY HE MAY NOT BE ESTEEMED A VERY VIRTUOUS PRINCE AND ENTIRELY WORTHY OF TRUST FROM HIS PEOPLE
AND THESE UNITED WITH THE REGULAR FORCES BENT ALL THEIR EFFORTS AGAINST THE KING

MARVEL AND MILTON WERE IN HIS SERVICE
PURNET
AND WHEREAS ALSO BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT IN THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING EDWARD III IT IS DECLARED AND ENACTED THAT NO MAN SHOULD BE FOREJUDGED OF LIFE OR LIMB AGAINST THE FORM OF THE GREAT CHARTER AND LAW OF THE LAND
UPON THE ADMISSION OF THE SECLUDED MEMBERS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PARTICULARLY THE LATE KING'S JUDGES WERE SEIZED WITH THE JUSTEST DESPAIR AND ENDEAVORED TO INFUSE THE SAME SENTIMENT INTO THE ARMY
EVERY MAN AS PROMPTED BY THE WARMTH OF HIS TEMPER EXCITED BY EMULATION OR SUPPORTED BY HIS HABITS OF HYPOCRISY ENDEAVORED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BEYOND HIS FELLOWS AND TO ARRIVE AT A HIGHER PITCH OF SAINTSHIP AND PERFECTION
MAGUIRE AND MORE WERE ALREADY IN TOWN WITH A NUMEROUS BAND OF THEIR PARTISANS
THEY ASKED HIM WHETHER HE DID NOT MEAN THAT HIS ELDEST SON RICHARD SHOULD SUCCEED HIM IN THE PROTECTORSHIP
IT IS A USUAL COMPLIMENT TO REGARD THE KING'S INCLINATION IN THE CHOICE OF A SPEAKER
HAVING JOINED THE CAMP AT BRISTOL AND SENT PRINCE MAURICE WITH A DETACHMENT INTO DEVONSHIRE HE DELIBERATED HOW TO EMPLOY THE REMAINING FORCES IN AN ENTERPRISE OF MOMENT
HE I MUST CONFESS IS NO GOOD SUBJECT WHO WOULD NOT WILLINGLY AND CHEERFULLY LAY DOWN HIS LIFE WHEN THAT SACRIFICE MAY PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF HIS SOVEREIGN AND THE GOOD OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND SUCH AN INSTANCE OF INDULGENCE IN THE ARMY WAS EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO HIM
THE WESTMINSTER PARLIAMENT PASSED A WHIMSICAL ORDINANCE COMMANDING ALL THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO RETRENCH A MEAL A WEEK AND TO PAY THE VALUE OF IT FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE PUBLIC CAUSE IT IS EASILY IMAGINED THAT PROVIDED THE MONEY WERE PAID THEY TROUBLED THEMSELVES BUT LITTLE ABOUT THE EXECUTION OF THEIR ORDINANCE
234 FROM THESE AVOWED MAXIMS THE COMMONS FORESAW THAT IF THE LEAST HANDLE WERE AFFORDED THE KING WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVE THEM AND WOULD THENCEFORWARD DEEM HIMSELF JUSTIFIED FOR VIOLATING IN A MANNER STILL MORE OPEN ALL THE ANCIENT FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION
88 89 90 207 462 718
MONEY NOW MORE THAN EVER BECAME NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REPAIR SO GREAT A BREACH IN THE ALLIANCE AND TO SUPPORT A PRINCE WHO WAS SO NEARLY ALLIED TO CHARLES AND WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THE WAR CHIEFLY BY THE INTRIGUES SOLICITATIONS AND PROMISES OF THE ENGLISH MONARCH
THE EXTREME CONTEMPT ENTERTAINED FOR THE NATIVES IN IRELAND MADE THE POPULAR LEADERS BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE EASY AT ANY TIME TO SUPPRESS THEIR REBELLION AND RECOVER THAT KINGDOM
896
AND THE CAMP IN MANY RESPECTS CARRIED MORE THE APPEARANCE OF CIVIL LIBERTY THAN OF MILITARY OBEDIENCE
THESE WERE CONSIDERABLE DIMINUTIONS BOTH OF REVENUE AND PREROGATIVE
HOBBES'S POLITICS ARE FITTED ONLY TO PROMOTE TYRANNY AND HIS ETHICS TO ENCOURAGE LICENTIOUSNESS
AND THE PHYSICIANS WERE OBLIGED TO BREAK SILENCE AND TO DECLARE THAT THE PROTECTOR COULD NOT SURVIVE THE NEXT FIT WITH WHICH HE WAS THREATENED
AND THE GENERALS OF GREATEST FAME AND CAPACITY HAPPENED ALL OF THEM TO SPRING UP ON THE SIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT
CROMWELL IN 1657 RETURNED TO THE OLD PRACTICE OF FARMING
BESIDES PITYING THE RUIN AND DESOLATION OF SO MANY ANCIENT AND HONORABLE FAMILIES INDIFFERENT SPECTATORS COULD NOT BUT BLAME THE HARDSHIP OF PUNISHING WITH SUCH SEVERITY ACTIONS WHICH THE LAW IN ITS USUAL AND MOST UNDISPUTED INTERPRETATION STRICTLY REQUIRED OF EVERY SUBJECT
A DIVINE AND APOSTOLICAL CHARTER WAS INSISTED ON PREFERABLY TO A LEGAL AND PARLIAMENTARY ONE STATE PAPERS COLLECTED BY THE EARL OF CLARENDON P 338
EVEN WHEN AMONG THEM HE WOULD IN THE MIDST OF ANY DISCOURSE INVITE THEM ALL TO PRAYER AND PUT HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THEM
BUT THE KING REPLIED TO D'ESTRADES THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR WHO OPENED THE PROPOSAL THAT HE HAD A SQUADRON READY AND WOULD CROSS THE SEAS IF NECESSARY WITH AN ARMY OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE PROJECTED CONQUESTS THIS ANSWER WHICH PROVES THAT CHARLES THOUGH HE EXPRESSED HIS MIND WITH AN IMPRUDENT CANDOR HAD AT LAST ACQUIRED A JUST IDEA OF NATIONAL INTEREST IRRITATED CARDINAL RICHELIEU
THEY HAD ON OTHER OCCASIONS BEEN GRADUALLY ENCROACHING ON THE EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE CROWN WHICH FORMS ITS PRINCIPAL AND MOST NATURAL BRANCH OF AUTHORITY
BEING CARRIED INTO A PRIVATE ROOM IT WAS THOUGHT PROPER SO FAR TO DISSEMBLE AS TO TELL HIM THAT BUCKINGHAM WAS ONLY GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED BUT NOT WITHOUT HOPES OF RECOVERY
ANTRIM HAD NO HAND IN THE FIRST REBELLION AND THE MASSACRE
THEIR ARMS FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF THE IRISH SUPPLIED THEM WITH WHAT THEY MOST WANTED THE JUSTICES WILLING TO FOMENT THE REBEL LION IN A VIEW OF PROFITING BY THE MULTIPLIED FORFEITURES HENCEFORTH THOUGHT OF NOTHING MORE THAN PROVIDING FOR THEIR OWN PRESENT SECURITY AND THAT OF THE CAPITAL
WHILE THE SCOTS WERE MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE INVASION OF ENGLAND EVERY PART OF THAT KINGDOM WAS AGITATED WITH TUMULTS INSURRECTIONS CONSPIRACIES DISCONTENTS
AND IN THE CRITICAL MOMENT STRUCK THAT IMPORTANT BLOW OF SEIZING THE KING'S PERSON AND DEPRIVING THE PARLIAMENT OF ANY RESOURCE OF AN ACCOMMODATION WITH HIM
WE SHALL THEREFORE APPROACH NEARER TO THE TRUTH IF WE MENTION ALL THE VIEWS WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM
THESE FIVE MEMBERS AT LEAST PYM HAMBDEN AND HOLLIS ARE THE VERY HEADS OF THE POPULAR PARTY
AND IF COMPLIANCE WERE REFUSED NO SUPPLY MUST BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMMONS
AND THE FIRE WAS NOW FALLEN AMONG THEM
THE FLUCTUATING NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION THE IMPATIENT HUMOR OF THE PEOPLE AND THE VARIETY OF EVENTS HAD NO DOUBT IN DIFFERENT AGES PRODUCED EXCEPTIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY WERE TIED DOWN TO FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF COMMISSIONERS WHO DISCONCERTED THEM IN ALL THEIR PROJECTS CLARENDON
YET WILL NOT THIS PROMOTION APPEAR THE EFFECT OF SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT FAIRFAX HIMSELF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD NOT THE ADVANTAGE OF A SEAT IN PARLIAMENT HAD THROUGH THE SAME STEPS ATTAINED EVEN A SUPERIOR RANK AND IF ENDUED WITH COMMON CAPACITY AND PENETRATION HAD BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN IT
WHEN THE LATE KING AGREED TO THAT CESSATION OF ARMS WITH THE POPISH REBELS WHICH WAS BECOME SO REQUISITE AS WELL FOR THE SECURITY OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AS FOR PROMOTING HIS INTERESTS IN ENGLAND THE PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO BLACKEN HIS CONDUCT REPROACHED HIM WITH FAVORING THAT ODIOUS REBELLION AND EXCLAIMED LOUDLY AGAINST THE TERMS OF THE CESSATION
ALL EUROPE STOOD ASTONISHED TO SEE A NATION SO TURBULENT AND UNRULY WHO FOR SOME DOUBTFUL ENCROACHMENTS ON THEIR PRIVILEGES HAD DETHRONED AND MURDERED AN EXCELLENT PRINCE DESCENDED FROM A LONG LINE OF MONARCHS NOW AT LAST SUBDUED AND REDUCED TO SLAVERY BY ONE WHO A FEW YEARS BEFORE WAS NO BETTER THAN A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN WHOSE NAME WAS NOT KNOWN IN THE NATION AND WHO WAS LITTLE REGARDED EVEN IN THAT LOW SPHERE TO WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONFINED
ASK HIS CLOAK HE GAVE YOU HIS COAT ALSO
LEARNING ALSO AND THE UNIVERSITIES WERE DEEMED HEATHENISH AND UNNECESSARY
AND AS THE FORCE OF THE CITIES WAS MORE UNITED THAN THAT OF THE COUNTRY AND AT ONCE GAVE SHELTER AND PROTECTION TO THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WHO COULD EASILY SUPPRESS THE ROYALISTS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ALMOST THE WHOLE KINGDOM AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR SEEMED TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE PARLIAMENT WALKER P 336
P 189
TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS
THE EXPORTS DOUBLE IN VALUE TO THE IMPORTS
IT BEHOVED HIM THEREFORE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AND TO COVER HIS ENTERPRISES UNDER THE PRETENCE OF ANCIENT PRECEDENTS WHICH CONSIDERING THE GREAT AUTHORITY COMMONLY ENJOYED BY HIS PREDECESSORS COULD NOT BE WANTING TO HIM
GENERAL HARRISON AND ABOUT TWENTY MORE REMAINED IN THE HOUSE
THAT IS IN IMPOSING BY RIGOROUS MEASURES HIS OWN TENETS AND PIOUS CEREMONIES ON THE OBSTINATE PURITANS WHO HAD PROFANELY DARED TO OPPOSE HIM
IF WE SURVEY THE MORAL CHARACTER OF CROMWELL WITH THAT INDULGENCE WHICH IS DUE TO THE BLINDNESS AND INFIRMITIES OF THE HUMAN SPECIES WE SHALL NOT BE INCLINED TO LOAD HIS MEMORY WITH SUCH VIOLENT REPROACHES AS THOSE WHICH HIS ENEMIES USUALLY THROW UPON IT
BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WITH SHIPS
WE COULD WISH THAT BLINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN UPON YOUR EYES TO ALL THOSE MARVELLOUS DISPENSATIONS WHICH GOD HATH WROUGHT LATELY IN ENGLAND
THE INHABITANTS HAD CAREFULLY CONCEALED ALL PROVISIONS FROM THE KING'S ARMY AND PRETENDING TO BE QUITE EXHAUSTED HAD RESERVED THEIR STORES FOR THAT CAUSE WHICH THEY SO MUCH FAVORED THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY STILL REMAINED
THE GROUND IS HOLY
THAT IN THE PRESENT CASE CHANGING THIS KINGDOM INTO THAT KINGDOM A VERY SLIGHT ALTERATION THE EARL'S DISCOURSE COULD REGARD NOTHING BUT SCOTLAND AND IMPLIES NO ADVICE UNWORTHY OF AN ENGLISH COUNSELLOR
IT IS TRUE ADDED HE WE GIVE LAW TO HARES AND DEER FOR THEY ARE BEASTS OF CHASE
WHAT REMAINED OF THIS HERO'S LIFE WAS ONE CONTINUED SERIES OF VICTORY FOR WHICH HE WAS LESS BEHOLDEN TO FORTUNE THAN TO THOSE PERSONAL ENDOWMENTS WHICH HE DERIVED FROM NATURE AND FROM INDUSTRY
IT APPEARS NOT THAT THE COMMONS THOUGH NOW ENTIRELY MASTERS ABOLISHED THE NEW IMPOSITIONS OF JAMES AGAINST WHICH THEY HAD FORMERLY SO LOUDLY COMPLAINED
THEY HAD ENTERED INTO A PLOT TO BLOW UP THE RIVER WITH GUNPOWDER IN ORDER TO DROWN THE CITY PROVISIONS OF ARMS WERE MAKING BEYOND SEA
AS THE DREAD OF ILLS IS COMMONLY MORE OPPRESSIVE THAN THEIR REAL PRESENCE PERHAPS IN NO PERIOD OF HIS LIFE WAS HE MORE JUSTLY THE OBJECT OF COMPASSION
AND THAT SUCH MEN ALONE WHOSE INTERESTS WERE INVOLVED IN THOSE OF THE PUBLIC AND WHO POSSESSED A VOTE IN THE CIVIL DELIBERATIONS WOULD SUFFICIENTLY RESPECT THE AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT AND NEVER COULD BE TEMPTED TO TURN THE SWORD AGAINST THOSE BY WHOM IT WAS COMMITTED TO THEM WHITLOCKE P
HE WAS IN THIS RESPECT HAPPY THAT ALL HIS ENEMIES WERE ALSO IMAGINED BY HIM THE DECLARED ENEMIES TO LOYALTY AND TRUE PIETY AND THAT EVERY EXERCISE OF HIS ANGER BY THAT MEANS BECAME IN HIS EYES A MERIT AND A VIRTUE
BUT ASSURE OURSELVES OF A HAPPY ISSUE
WHEN WE CONSIDER CHARLES AS PRESIDING IN HIS COURT AS ASSOCIATING WITH HIS FAMILY IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A CHARACTER AT ONCE MORE RESPECTABLE AND MORE AMIABLE
HE THERE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THE FAMOUS CARDINAL DE RETZ AND THAT PENETRATING JUDGE CELEBRATES HIM IN HIS MEMOIRS AS ONE OF THOSE HEROES OF WHOM THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY REMAINS IN THE WORLD AND WHO ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH IN PLUTARCH
PARTICULARLY COLONEL TOMLINSON TO WHOSE CARE HE HAD LATELY BEEN COMMITTED AND UPON WHOM AS UPON MANY OTHERS HIS AMIABLE DEPORTMENT HAD WROUGHT AN ENTIRE CONVERSION
THOUGH THESE WRITINGS WERE OF CONSEQUENCE AND TENDED MUCH TO RECONCILE THE NATION TO CHARLES IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE DECISIVE AND THAT KEENER WEAPONS MUST DETERMINE THE CONTROVERSY
AN ARMY OF FIVE THOUSAND MEN LAY IN THE NORTH UNDER THE COMMAND OF GENERAL POINTZ WHO WAS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN FACTION
THAT THEY HAD AIMED AT SUBVERTING THE RIGHTS AND VERY BEING OF PARLIAMENT
ON ONE HAND A FIRST MAGISTRATE IN SO EXTENSIVE A GOVERNMENT SEEMED NECESSARY BOTH FOR THE DIGNITY AND TRANQUILLITY OF THE STATE
CIVIL WARS ESPECIALLY WHEN FOUNDED ON PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY ARE NOT COMMONLY UNFAVORABLE TO THE ARTS OF ELOCUTION AND COMPOSITION
IT IS SURPRISING THAT CHARLES WHO HAD SEEN SO MANY INSTANCES OF THE JEALOUSY OF THE COMMONS WHO HAD HIMSELF SO MUCH ROUSED THAT JEALOUSY BY HIS FREQUENT EVASIVE MESSAGES DURING THIS SESSION COULD IMAGINE THAT THEY WOULD REST SATISFIED WITH AN ANSWER SO VAGUE AND UNDETERMINATE
BUT WAS OPENLY DECLARED TO BE AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE
WITHOUT PROVOCATION WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE ASTONISHED ENGLISH LIVING IN PROFOUND PEACE AND FULL SECURITY WERE MASSACRED BY THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS WITH WHOM THEY HAD LONG UPHELD A CONTINUED INTERCOURSE OF KINDNESS AND GOOD OFFICES BUT DEATH WAS THE LIGHTEST PUNISHMENT INFLICTED BY THOSE REBELS
AND IN HIS MAJESTY'S NAME DISSOLVED IT
AND THE AUTHORITY WHICH HE ASSUMED AS PROTECTOR WAS IN SOME RESPECTS INFERIOR TO THE PREROGATIVES WHICH THE LAWS INTRUSTED AND STILL INTRUST TO THE KING
THEY WERE LODGED IN THE CITY AND KEPT AN INTIMATE CORRESPONDENCE AS WELL WITH THE MAGISTRATES WHO WERE EXTREMELY DISAFFECTED AS WITH THE POPULAR LEADERS IN BOTH HOUSES
THE DUTCH FLEET WAS DISPERSED AND RECEIVED GREAT DAMAGE
ONLY INSTEAD OF LAYING THE FAULT ON BOTH PARTIES AS WALKER DOES HE ASCRIBES IT SOLELY TO THE INDEPENDENT FACTION
PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY-GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
BIRCH P
THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
WITH OTHERS OF FALSE MODESTY
AND BOTH ARMIES ERE THEY WERE AWARE HAD ADVANCED WITHIN SIX MILES OF EACH OTHER
TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
RUSH PART
A PLEASANT COMEDY WHICH PAINTS THE MANNERS OF THE AGE AND EXPOSES A FAITHFUL PICTURE OF NATURE IS A DURABLE WORK AND IS TRANSMITTED TO THE LATEST POSTERITY
EVERY WHERE THIS SQUADRON SUBSISTED BY PRIVATEERING SOMETIMES ON ENGLISH SOMETIMES ON SPANISH VESSELS
CHARLES NATURALLY DISGUSTED WITH PARLIAMENTS WHO HE FOUND WERE DETERMINED TO PROCEED AGAINST HIM WITH UNMITIGATED RIGOR BOTH IN INVADING HIS PREROGATIVE AND REFUSING HIM ALL SUPPLY RESOLVED NOT TO CALL ANY MORE TILL HE SHOULD SEE GREATER INDICATIONS OF A COMPLIANT DISPOSITION IN THE NATION
AND ENCOURAGED BY THE SUPERIORITY OF NUMBER FOR THE COVENANTERS WERE DOUBLE THE ROYALISTS ATTACKED HIM IN THE POST WHICH HE HAD CHOSEN MONTROSE HAVING PLACED HIS RIGHT WING IN STRONG GROUND DREW THE BEST OF HIS FORCES TO THE OTHER AND LEFT NO MAIN BODY BETWEEN THEM
THE PREACHERS WOULD RETAIN THEIR INNATE ARROGANCE
IT WAS DURING A STATE OF POVERTY BLINDNESS DISGRACE DANGER AND OLD AGE THAT MILTON COMPOSED HIS WONDERFUL POEM WHICH NOT ONLY SURPASSED ALL THE PERFORMANCES OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES BUT ALL THE COMPOSITIONS WHICH HAD FLOWED FROM HIS PEN DURING THE VIGOR OF HIS AGE AND THE HEIGHT OF HIS PROSPERITY
THE ARMY MARCHED IN TRIUMPH THROUGH THE CITY
HE WAS THE LAST OF THE ARMY THAT EMBARKED
1654 THIS PROJECT APPEARED SO WILD TO THE STATES THAT THEY WONDERED ANY MAN OF SENSE COULD EVER ENTERTAIN IT
THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS OF THAT PARTY HAD INTENDED THAT THE ARMY THEMSELVES SHOULD EXECUTE THAT DARING ENTERPRISE
1660 LAMBERT WAS NOW IN A VERY DISCONSOLATE CONDITION
THE KING HOPING THAT EVERY THING WOULD YIELD BEFORE HIM ADVANCED WITH HIS WHOLE ARMY TO READING
FROM THE FERVOR OF THEIR ZEAL THE QUAKERS BROKE INTO CHURCHES DISTURBED PUBLIC WORSHIP AND HARASSED THE MINISTER AND AUDIENCE WITH RAILING AND REPROACHES
THE PROGRESS OF THE SCOTTISH MALECONTENTS REDUCED THE CROWN TO AN ENTIRE DEPENDENCE FOR SUPPLY
YOU HAVE DONE YOUR WORK SAID ASTLEY TO THE PARLIAMENTARY OFFICERS
ALL CONSIDERATIONS WERE UNDERVALUED IN COMPARISON OF THEIR BIGOTED PREJUDICES 19 SEE NOTE S AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
SINCE EACH OF THEM SENT TO HIS OWN STATE A RELATION TOTALLY OPPOSITE IN ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES TO THAT OF THE OTHER AND YET SUPPORTED BY THE TESTIMONY OF EVERY CAPTAIN IN HIS FLEET
AMIDST THAT COMPLICATION OF DISPUTES IN WHICH MEN WERE THEN INVOLVED WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE APPELLATION PURITAN STOOD FOR THREE PARTIES WHICH THOUGH COMMONLY UNITED WERE YET ACTUATED BY VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS AND MOTIVES
BESIDES ALL THEIR OTHER MOTIVES THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD MADE A DISCOVERY WHICH AS THEY WANTED BUT A PRETENCE FOR THEIR REFUSAL INFLAMED THEM AGAINST THE COURT AND AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
204
WHILE THE FIGHT WAS CONTINUED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY AND VICTORY SEEMED TO INCLINE TO THE ROYALISTS JONES FELL UPON THEM FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND PUT THEM TO ROUT WITH THE LOSS OF SIX HUNDRED SLAIN AND ONE THOUSAND PRISONERS THE KING WITH THE REMAINS OF HIS BROKEN ARMY FLED TO NEWARK AND THENCE ESCAPED TO OXFORD WHERE HE SHUT HIMSELF UP DURING THE WINTER SEASON
MONARCHY AS WELL AS THE HIERARCHY WAS BECOME ODIOUS TO THEM
THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TOO SMALL A PARTY EVER TO ESTABLISH A POPULAR GOVERNMENT OR INTRUST THE NATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LITTLE INTEREST WITH THE FREE CHOICE OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES
AND A GREAT FORCE WAS THERE RAISED AND PAID FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY AGAINST THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS
A NUMBER OF NEIGHBORING PARISHES COMMONLY BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY FORMED A CLASSIS
THE PARLIAMENT TOOK THIS REMONSTRANCE IN ILL PART AND MADE A SHARP REPLY TO THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS
AND THE SCOTS FREED FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE ECCLESIASTICS WERE NOT MUCH DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT 25 THE PRUDENT CONDUCT OF MONK A MAN WHO POSSESSED A CAPACITY FOR THE ARTS BOTH OF PEACE AND WAR SERVED MUCH TO RECONCILE THE MINDS OF MEN AND TO ALLAY THEIR PREJUDICES
THEY INSTANTLY REVERSED THE FORMER VOTE AND DECLARED THE KING'S CONCESSIONS UNSATISFACTORY
THE AGED PRIMATE DISSOLVED IN TEARS
P 214
129
AND THERE WAS NO REASON WHICH REQUIRED THE ONE TO BE DISSOLVED UPON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE OTHER
BUT WHEN IT IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDS A LEGAL CONSTITUTION IT MAY AT FIRST TO FOREIGN NATIONS APPEAR VERY VIGOROUS AND ACTIVE AND MAY EXERT WITH MORE UNANIMITY THAT POWER SPIRIT AND RICHES WHICH HAD BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER A BETTER FORM
AND THE LAW WAS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE WRESTED IN ORDER TO PROLONG THEIR IMPRISONMENT
IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER
OF NEGLECTING TO GUARD THE SEAS INSOMUCH THAT MANY MERCHANT SHIPS HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
MUCH LESS THE RESULT OF WANTON TYRANNY AND INJUSTICE
EDWARD VI,[V AND QUEEN ELIZABETH,[V WHO HAD BOTH OF THEM MADE USE OF THIS EXPEDIENT FOR RAISING MONEY HAD SUMMONED ONLY THOSE WHO WERE POSSESSED OF FORTY POUNDS A YEAR AND UPWARDS TO RECEIVE KNIGHTHOOD OR COMPOUND FOR THEIR NEGLECT
THE KING WAS OBLIGED IN ORDER TO ARM HIS FOLLOWERS TO BORROW THE WEAPONS OF THE TRAIN BANDS UNDER PROMISE OF RESTORING THEM AS SOON AS PEACE SHOULD BE SETTLED IN THE KINGDOM
NEXT DAY THE KING DECAMPED AND MARCHED TOWARDS DAVENTRY
THIS INTELLIGENCE INSTEAD OF STRIKING TERROR INTO THE ENGLISH REPUBLIC WAS CONSIDERED AS A MENACE AND FURTHER CONFIRMED THE PARLIAMENT IN THEIR HOSTILE RESOLUTIONS
A DEFECT WHICH HE ARTFULLY CONCEALED BY SHOWING A FEW MEN THROUGH THE TREES AND BUSHES WITH WHICH THAT GROUND WAS COVERED
THE CORNISH ROYALISTS THEREFORE BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES OF LEVYING A FORCE WHICH MIGHT BE MORE SERVICEABLE
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT HOWEVER HAVING ASSUMED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE RESENTED THE COUNTENANCE COLD AS IT WAS WHICH THE FRENCH COURT GAVE TO THE UNFORTUNATE MONARCH
267
267
267
TO DECEIVE SUCH MEN WOULD ARGUE A SUPERLATIVE CAPACITY IN CROMWELL
AND THE KING WITH EQUAL DISSIMULATION PRETENDED TO REPOSE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN ARGYLE
IT MAY BE WORTH OBSERVING THAT ALL HISTORIANS WHO LIVED NEAR THAT AGE OR WHAT PERHAPS IS MORE DECISIVE ALL AUTHORS WHO HAVE CASUALLY MADE MENTION OF THOSE PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS STILL REPRESENT THE CIVIL DISORDERS AND CONVULSIONS AS PROCEEDING FROM RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY AND CONSIDER THE POLITICAL DISPUTES ABOUT POWER AND LIBERTY AS ENTIRELY SUBORDINATE TO THE OTHER
AND TO THIS INNOVATION THE POPULAR LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS AS WELL AS THEIR MORE DEVOTED PARTISANS WERE OF THEMSELVES SUFFICIENTLY INCLINED
EXPOSED WITHOUT REVENUE WITHOUT ARMS TO THE ASSAULT OF FURIOUS IMPLACABLE AND BIGOTED FACTIONS IT WAS NEVER PERMITTED HIM BUT WITH THE MOST FATAL CONSEQUENCES TO COMMIT THE SMALLEST MISTAKE
AND THEY WERE SCANDALIZED TO HEAR THEIR BELOVED COVENANT SPOKEN OF EVERY DAY WITH LESS REGARD AND REVERENCE
AND BY THE GENIUS OF THE OLD CONSTITUTION THE PRINCE OF HIMSELF WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASSUME EVERY BRANCH OF PREROGATIVE WHICH WAS FOUND NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC PEACE AND OF HIS OWN AUTHORITY
THE SOLDIERS WERE THE REFUSE OF THE WHOLE ARMY
NOTHING COULD BE MORE POPULAR THAN THIS HOSTILITY WHICH THE ARMY COMMENCED AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT
THE ENGLISH FLEET CAME IN SIGHT OF SCHEVELING
AND HIS CONJUNCTION WITH THE ROYALISTS THEY REGARDED AS A DANGEROUS SYMPTOM
PROSELYTES WERE EASILY GAINED AT A TIME WHEN ALL MEN'S AFFECTIONS WERE TURNED TOWARDS RELIGION AND WHEN THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT MODES OF IT WERE SURE TO BE MOST POPULAR
HIS RETURN THEREFORE TO LOYALTY WAS EASY AND OPEN
EVEN ALLOWING THAT THE KING INTENDED TO EMPLOY VIOLENCE NOT AUTHORITY FOR SEIZING THE MEMBERS
THE NATION THEY SAW WAS ALREADY TO THE LAST DEGREE EXASPERATED
WHERE ALL FREEDOM OF DEBATE OUGHT TO BE PERMITTED AND WHERE IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE MEMBERS IN ORDER TO DRAW FORTH THE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS TO PROPOSE COUNSELS VERY REMOTE FROM THEIR OWN SECRET ADVICE AND JUDGMENT THE EVIDENCE OF SECRETARY VANE THOUGH EXPOSED TO SUCH UNSURMOUNTABLE OBJECTIONS WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF STRAFFORD UNHAPPY FATE
AS NO HUMAN MIND EVER CONTAINED SO STRANGE A MIXTURE OF SAGACITY AND ABSURDITY AS THAT OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PERSONAGE
I SHOWED HIM EVIDENTLY SAID CROMWELL HOW THIS SUCCESS MIGHT BE OBTAINED
THE CHIEF ARTICLES OF THE INSTRUMENT ARE THESE
BESIDES THAT THESE WERE SURE TO DISPLEASE AS INNOVATIONS THERE LAY IN THE OPINION OF THE PUBLIC ANOTHER VERY FORCIBLE OBJECTION AGAINST THEM
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE BUT YOUNG LORD STRAFFORD MUST INFORM THE KING WHO WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO TRACE THE FORGERY AND EXPOSE HIS ENEMIES TO THEIR MERITED INFAMY
AND THE DANGER TO WHICH THE CONSTITUTION SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SO LATELY EXPOSED PERSUADED MANY THAT IT NEVER COULD BE SUFFICIENTLY SECURED BUT BY THE ENTIRE ABOLITION OF THAT AUTHORITY WHICH HAD INVADED IT
STRIKING IN WITH THE FANATICAL NOTIONS OF THE ENTIRE EQUALITY OF MANKIND IT WOULD INSURE THE DEVOTED OBEDIENCE OF THE ARMY AND SERVE AS A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT AGAINST THE ROYAL FAMILY WHOM BY THEIR OPEN AND UNITED DEED THEY WOULD SO HEINOUSLY AFFRONT AND INJURE THIS MEASURE THEREFORE BEING SECRETLY RESOLVED ON IT WAS REQUISITE BY DEGREES TO MAKE THE PARLIAMENT ADOPT IT AND TO CONDUCT THEM FROM VIOLENCE TO VIOLENCE TILL THIS LAST ACT OF ATROCIOUS INIQUITY SHOULD SEEM IN A MANNER WHOLLY INEVITABLE
THE PRESBYTERIAN OR THE MODERATE PARTY AMONG THE COMMONS FOUND THEMSELVES CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED BY HIS DEATH
HE IS LESS PARTIAL IN HIS RELATION OF FACTS THAN IN HIS ACCOUNT OF CHARACTERS
WHILE EVERY THING AROUND HIM BORE A HOSTILE ASPECT
IN THIS MANNER THE ACTION BEGAN
THESE TWO PARTIES COMPOSED THE BULK OF THE NATION AND KEPT THE PEOPLE IN SOME TOLERABLE TEMPER
GREAT MURMURS AND DISCONTENTS STILL PREVAILED IN PARLIAMENT
THE PURITANICAL PARTY WHOSE PROGRESS THOUGH SECRET HAD HITHERTO BEEN GRADUAL IN THE KINGDOM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PRESENT DISORDERS BEGAN OPENLY TO PROFESS THEIR TENETS AND TO MAKE FURIOUS ATTACKS ON THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION
P 129
THAT THOUGH HIS COFFERS WERE EMPTY THEY HAD NOT BEEN EXHAUSTED BY UNNECESSARY POMP OR SUMPTUOUS BUILDINGS OR ANY OTHER KIND OF MAGNIFICENCE

EVEN THOSE ON WHOM HE CONFERRED ANY FAVOR NEVER DEEMED THE RECOMPENSE AN EQUIVALENT FOR THE SACRIFICES WHICH THEY MADE TO OBTAIN IT
BUT UPON HIS SUBMISSION DISMISSED LEIGHTON WHO HAD WRITTEN LIBELS AGAINST THE KING THE QUEEN THE BISHOPS AND THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION WAS CONDEMNED BY A VERY SEVERE IF NOT A CRUEL SENTENCE
THOUGH NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN EASIER THAN FOR THE PARLIAMENT TO HAVE PREVENTED IT STATE TRIALS VOL

SO GREAT WAS HIS ART OF MANAGING ELECTIONS AND BALANCING PARTIES THAT HE HAD ENGAGED THE IRISH PARLIAMENT TO VOTE WHATEVER WAS NECESSARY BOTH FOR THE PAYMENT OF FORMER DEBTS AND FOR SUPPORT OF THE NEW-LEVIED ARMY
THAT HIS POWER WAS AT PRESENT FETTERED BY THE HUGONOTS WHO BEING POSSESSED OF MANY PRIVILEGES AND EVEN OF FORTIFIED TOWNS FORMED AN EMPIRE WITHIN HIS EMPIRE AND KEPT HIM IN PERPETUAL JEALOUSY AND INQUIETUDE
THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH HIS POPULARITY IN THE ARMY
THOUGH IN THIS INSTANCE THE KING SAW MORE EVIDENTLY THE FURIOUS SPIRIT BY WHICH THE SCOTS WERE ACTUATED HE HAD NOW NO FURTHER RESOURCE AND WAS OBLIGED TO GRANT WHATEVER WAS DEMANDED OF HIM
SO THAT MANY GENTLEMEN AND YOUNGER BROTHERS OF GOOD FAMILY ENLISTED IN THE PROTECTOR'S CAVALRY.[V NO WONDER THAT SUCH MEN WERE AVERSE FROM THE REESTABLISHMENT OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT BY WHICH THEY WELL KNEW THEY MUST BE DEPRIVED OF SO GAINFUL A PROFESSION
BUT NOT TRUSTING ALTOGETHER TO THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE HE USED EVERY ART WHICH HIS NEW MODEL OF REPRESENTATION ALLOWED HIM TO EMPLOY IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTIONS AND FILL THE HOUSE WITH HIS OWN CREATURES
CROMWELL HAD TWO DAUGHTERS UNMARRIED
AND THESE PRACTICES WERE TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH MONARCHY 5 THE KING DISAPPOINTED OF PARLIAMENTARY SUBSIDIES WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO OTHER EXPEDIENTS IN ORDER TO SUPPLY HIS URGENT NECESSITIES
ONE CHIEF ARTICLE OF BUSINESS FOR IT DESERVES THE NAME WHICH THE KING TRANSACTED IN THIS PARLIAMENT WAS BESIDES OBTAINING SOME SUPPLY TO PROCURE AUTHORITY FOR ORDERING THE HABITS OF CLERGYMEN THE ACT DID NOT PASS WITHOUT OPPOSITION AND DIFFICULTY
MANY OF THE PRELATES THEREFORE WERE RAISED TO THE CHIEF DIGNITIES OF THE STATE SPOTSWOOD ARCHBISHOP OF ST ANDREWS WAS CREATED CHANCELLOR
WITH THIS FRIEND ALONE DID MONK DELIBERATE CONCERNING THAT GREAT ENTERPRISE WHICH HE HAD PROJECTED
MEANWHILE THE UNFORTUNATE KING WAS NECESSITATED TO TAKE SHELTER IN THE SCOTTISH ARMY
A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE
THE ACCUSATION AND DEFENCE LASTED EIGHTEEN DAYS
FOUR OF CHARLES'S FRIENDS PERSONS OF VIRTUE AND DIGNITY RICHMOND HERTFORD SOUTHAMPTON LINDESEY APPLIED TO THE COMMONS
THOU MUST NOT BE A KING AS LONG AS THY BROTHERS CHARLES AND JAMES ARE ALIVE
IN THE FAMOUS STATUTE OF EDWARD III ALL THE KINDS OF TREASON ARE ENUMERATED
THE EARL OF MANCHESTER PROVOKED AT THE IMPEACHMENT WHICH THE KING HAD LODGED AGAINST HIM HAD LONG FORWARDED THE WAR WITH ALACRITY
THE GLOOMY ENTHUSIASM WHICH PREVAILED AMONG THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY IS SURELY THE MOST CURIOUS SPECTACLE PRESENTED BY ANY HISTORY
THESE LETTERS WERE WRITTEN BY ONE OSBALDISTONE A SCHOOLMASTER AND WERE DIRECTED TO WILLIAMS
WHAT WAS NOT EXPECTED IT WAS ATTENDED WITH CONSEQUENCES IN ENGLAND
AND THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR FOR HIS OWN PART ACCUSING HIMSELF AS ONE WHO ENJOYED A GAINFUL OFFICE THAT OF TREASURER OF THE NAVY
AND THE ROYAL ARMY IMMEDIATELY ADVANCED UPON HIM
O'CONOLLY AN IRISHMAN BUT A PROTESTANT BETRAYED THE CONSPIRACY TO PARSONS THE JUSTICES AND COUNCIL FLED IMMEDIATELY FOR SAFETY INTO THE CASTLE AND REENFORCED THE GUARDS
THE GARLAND AND BONAVENTURE WERE TAKEN
THESE OBSTACLES THEREFORE BEING SURMOUNTED THE PETITION OF RIGHT PASSED THE COMMONS AND WAS SENT TO THE UPPER HOUSE 2 THE PEERS WHO WERE PROBABLY WELL PLEASED IN SECRET THAT ALL THEIR SOLICITATIONS HAD BEEN ELUDED BY THE COMMONS QUICKLY PASSED THE PETITION WITHOUT ANY MATERIAL ALTERATION

SIR EDWARD HYDE CREATED LORD CHANCELLOR AND THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND WERE HIS CHIEF FRIENDS AND CONFIDANTS
A LIKE VOTE PASSED WITH REGARD TO THE MONARCHY
THE KING FORESEEING THIS TEMPEST WHICH WAS GATHERING UPON HIM ENDEAVORED TO SECURE HIMSELF BY EVERY EXPEDIENT
AND THOUGH HE AT LAST SACRIFICED HIS LIFE IN THE KING'S SERVICE HIS INTEGRITY AND SINCERITY HAVE NOT BEEN THOUGHT BY HISTORIANS ENTIRELY FREE FROM BLEMISH
ALL THESE FLOCKED TO THE KING'S STANDARD WHERE THEY BREATHED A FREER AIR AND WERE EXEMPTED FROM THAT RIGID PRECISENESS AND MELANCHOLY AUSTERITY WHICH REIGNED AMONG THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY
EVEN LONG WHO HAD ACTUALLY FOUND SURETIES IN THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S CHAMBER DECLARED IN COURT THAT HIS SURETIES SHOULD NO LONGER CONTINUE YET BECAUSE SIR JOHN ELLIOT HAPPENED TO DIE WHILE IN CUSTODY A GREAT CLAMOR WAS RAISED AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION
COLONEL TITUS UNDER THE NAME OF ALLEN HAD WRITTEN A SPIRITED DISCOURSE EXHORTING EVERY ONE TO EMBRACE THIS METHOD OF VENGEANCE
AND THOUGH THE CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH THEY HAD LEVIED AS WELL AS THE PRICE OF THEIR LIVING AT FREE QUARTERS MUST BE DEDUCTED YET STILL THE SUM WHICH THEY INSISTED ON WAS VERY CONSIDERABLE
THE RECONCILING DOCTRINES LIKEWISE OF MONTAGUE FAILED NOT ANEW TO MEET WITH SEVERE CENSURES FROM THAT ZEALOUS ASSEMBLY FRANKLYN P
AND HOWEVER SWEET THE SOUND OF LIBERTY MANY RESOLVED TO ADHERE TO THAT MODERATE FREEDOM TRANSMITTED THEM FROM THEIR ANCESTORS AND NOW BETTER SECURED BY SUCH IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN BY ENGAGING IN A GIDDY SEARCH AFTER MORE INDEPENDENCE RUN A MANIFEST RISK EITHER OF INCURRING A CRUEL SUBJECTION OR ABANDONING ALL LAW AND ORDER
BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
BY THIS LAW THOUGH THE TERMS IN WHICH IT WAS CONCEIVED WERE GENERAL THE DUTCH WERE PRINCIPALLY AFFECTED
CONDITIONS MORE SEVERE WERE NEVER IMPOSED BY SUBJECTS UPON THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND GORING IT WAS HOPED WOULD SOON BE MASTER OF TAUNTON AND HAVING PUT THE WEST IN FULL SECURITY WOULD THEN UNITE HIS FORCES TO THOSE OF THE KING AND GIVE HIM AN INCONTESTABLE SUPERIORITY OVER THE ENEMY
BUT THERE WAS NO ONE IN WHOSE VIGILANCE AND CAPACITY THEY REPOSED SUCH CONFIDENCE
TRANSPORTED TO A DEGREE OF MADNESS WITH RELIGIOUS ECSTASIES HE NEVER FORGOT THE POLITICAL PURPOSES TO WHICH THEY MIGHT SERVE
THAT IF THEY REFUSED TO TREAT WHICH WAS MORE PROBABLE THE VERY SOUND OF PEACE WAS SO POPULAR THAT NOTHING COULD MORE DISGUST THE NATION THAN SUCH HAUGHTY SEVERITY

OF SPAIN WHO WERE TOUCHED WITH THE SAME ELEGANT PASSION
THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES
NEAR TEN DAYS THEY SPENT IN INQUIRIES AND DEBATES ABOUT HIM WHITLOCKE P
AND THAT BUCKINGHAM THE ADMIRAL AND THE TREASURER OF THE NAVY HAD ADVANCED ON THEIR OWN CREDIT NEAR A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THE SEA SERVICE PARL
THAT THE ANCIENT PRACTICE OF PARLIAMENT WAS TO GIVE GRIEVANCES THE PRECEDENCY OF SUPPLY
THE SAGACITY OF A SMITH WHO REMARKED THAT HIS HORSE'S SHOES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NORTH NOT IN THE WEST AS HE PRETENDED ONCE DETECTED HIM
AND THE QUARREL GREW EVERY DAY HIGHER BETWEEN HIM AND THE COMMONS.[V MENTION WAS MADE IN THE HOUSE OF IMPEACHING SIR RICHARD WESTON THE TREASURER;[V AND THE KING BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THOUGHTS OF FINISHING THE SESSION BY A DISSOLUTION
THE PRUDENCE OF THE KING IN HIS CONDUCT OF THIS AFFAIR NOBODY PRETENDED TO JUSTIFY
NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
HE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF KILKENNY AND CLONMEL THE ONLY PLACES WHERE HE MET WITH ANY VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
THEY EVEN OBLIGED THE SERVANTS TO GIVE INTELLIGENCE AGAINST THEIR MASTERS
AND THOUGH THE PARLIAMENT UPON THEIR ASSEMBLING RENEWED THE ORDINANCES FOR IMPOSITIONS YET SO LITTLE REVERENCE DID THE PEOPLE PAY TO THOSE LEGISLATORS THAT THEY GAVE VERY SLOW AND UNWILLING OBEDIENCE TO THEIR COMMANDS
655
YET THESE MEN ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE ALONE COULD BY NO PERSUASION ARTIFICE OR ENTREATY BE INDUCED TO CONSENT THAT THEIR FRIEND AND PATRON SHOULD BE INVESTED WITH REGAL DIGNITY
ABOUT THIS TIME AN ACCIDENT HAD ALMOST ROBBED THE PROTECTOR OF HIS LIFE AND SAVED HIS ENEMIES THE TROUBLE OF ALL THEIR MACHINATIONS
523
523
AMIDST SUCH VIOLENT ANIMOSITIES POWER ALONE COULD INSURE SAFETY
IN PRETENCE OF OBVIATING THIS OBJECTION A BILL WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE AND PASSED WITH GREAT UNANIMITY AND RAPIDITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD NOT BE DISSOLVED PROROGUED OR ADJOURNED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
CLANRICARDE UNABLE TO RESIST THE PREVAILING POWER MADE SUBMISSIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT AND RETIRED INTO ENGLAND WHERE HE SOON AFTER DIED
HIS CONCURRENCE IN THE IRISH REBELLION PLAINLY INSINUATED
DISCRETIONARY ACTS OF JURISDICTION INDEED HE HAD OFTEN EXERTED BY HOLDING COURTS MARTIAL BILLETTING SOLDIERS DECIDING CAUSES UPON PAPER PETITIONS BEFORE THE COUNCIL ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS AND PUNISHING THEIR INFRACTION
THIS BILL QUICKLY PASSED THE LOWER HOUSE
THE KING WAS IN GREAT DOUBT AND PERPLEXITY
THE DEGREE OF HIS MERIT IN OTHER RESPECTS WAS DISPUTED
BUT THEIR ENEMIES UNWILLING THAT THEY SHOULD ANY WHERE ENJOY EASE AND CONTENTMENT AND DREADING PERHAPS THE DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES OF SO DISAFFECTED A COLONY PREVAILED ON THE KING TO ISSUE A PROCLAMATION DEBARRING THESE DEVOTEES ACCESS EVEN INTO THOSE INHOSPITABLE DESERTS EIGHT SHIPS LYING IN THE THAMES AND READY TO SAIL WERE DETAINED BY ORDER OF THE COUNCIL
THE MACHINE THEY THOUGHT WITH SOME REASON WAS ENCUMBERED WITH MANY WHEELS AND SPRINGS WHICH RETARDED AND CROSSED ITS OPERATIONS AND DESTROYED ITS UTILITY
18TH APRIL 1626
AND DECLARE THAT THEY COULD NOT ENGAGE FOR IRELAND TILL THEY WERE SATISFIED IN THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND HAD THEIR JUST DESIRES GRANTED.[V THE ARMY IN A WORD FELT THEIR POWER AND RESOLVED TO BE MASTERS
DEPRAVED NATURE EVEN PERVERTED RELIGION ENCOURAGED BY THE UTMOST LICENSE REACH NOT TO SUCH A PITCH OF FEROCITY UNLESS THE PITY INHERENT IN HUMAN BREASTS BE DESTROYED BY THAT CONTAGION OF EXAMPLE WHICH TRANSPORTS MEN BEYOND ALL THE USUAL MOTIVES OF CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR
BUT WHAT WAS MOST REMARKABLE IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THAT HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WHAT PROVED BEYOND CONTROVERSY THAT THEY HAD SERIOUSLY FORMED A PLAN FOR REDUCING THEIR PRINCE TO SUBJECTION WAS THAT INSTEAD OF GRANTING THIS SUPPLY DURING THE KING'S LIFETIME AS IT HAD BEEN ENJOYED BY ALL HIS IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS THEY VOTED IT ONLY FOR A YEAR
BUT FROM SUCH EXORBITANT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE PROJECTS THE NATURAL TRANQUILLITY AND MODERATION OF HIS TEMPER THE CALMNESS AND SOLIDITY OF HIS GENIUS NOT TO MENTION HIS AGE NOW UPON THE DECLINE SEEM TO HAVE SET HIM AT A DISTANCE
THE GENERAL QUESTION WE MAY OBSERVE WITH REGARD TO PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL CONTINUES ONE OF OF THE GREATEST MYSTERIES IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
THEIR PROPERTY WAS EXTENSIVE
AND HENRIETTA AFTERWARDS DUCHESS OF ORLEANS BORN AT EXETER 1644

SUCH WERE THE BARBARITIES BY WHICH SIR PHELIM O'NEALE AND THE IRISH IN ULSTER SIGNALIZED THEIR REBELLION
AND RICHARD WHOSE MODERATE UNAMBITIOUS CHARACTER NEVER WOULD HAVE LED HIM TO CONTEND FOR EMPIRE WAS TEMPTED TO ACCEPT OF SO RICH AN INHERITANCE WHICH SEEMED TO BE TENDERED TO HIM BY THE CONSENT OF ALL MANKIND
NOY ATTORNEY-GENERAL
NO AGE NO SEX NO CONDITION WAS SPARED
FLEETWOOD IN WHOSE FAVOR IT WAS SUPPOSED CROMWELL HAD FORMERLY MADE A WILL RENOUNCED ALL CLAIM OR PRETENSION TO THE PROTECTORSHIP
THE PARLIAMENT ON THE CONTRARY EVEN WHEN UNPROVOKED HAD EVER MENACED THE PAPISTS WITH THE MOST RIGID RESTRAINT IF NOT A TOTAL EXTIRPATION
REQUIRE A DISSOLUTION OF THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT AND A MORE EQUAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE FUTURE
BUT WHETHER IT WAS COMPOUNDED AS WAS USUAL IN FINES IMPOSED BY THE STAR CHAMBER WE ARE NOT INFORMED
THE AUTHORITY AS WELL AS MERITS OF ESSEX WAS VERY GREAT WITH THE PARLIAMENT
RASH
RASH
AFTER ALL THESE REPEATED DISASTERS WHICH EVERY WHERE BEFELL THE ROYAL PARTY THERE REMAINED ONLY ONE BODY OF TROOPS ON WHICH FORTUNE COULD EXERCISE HER RIGOR

BUT THOSE OFFICERS WHO WOULD GLADLY ON SUCH AN OCCASION HAVE INFLAMED THE QUARREL WERE ABSENT OR IN CONFINEMENT

AND IMMEDIATELY UPON THE RECEIPT OF IT IRETON AND I RESOLVED TO TAKE ONE TRUSTY FELLOW WITH US AND TO GO IN TROOPERS HABITS TO THAT INN
AND THAT THOSE WHICH BADE THE FAIREST FOR HIM SHOULD HAVE HIM
AND IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE LAWS OF NATIONS WARRANT ANY FURTHER PRETENSIONS
COLONEL JEPHSON IN ORDER TO SOUND THE INCLINATIONS OF THE HOUSE VENTURED TO MOVE THAT THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD BESTOW THE CROWN ON CROMWELL
A PRACTICE VERY UNUSUAL AND WHICH GAVE THEM THE APPEARANCE OF CONSPIRATORS MORE THAN MINISTERS OF JUSTICE BUT THE INTENTION OF THIS STRICTNESS WAS TO RENDER IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE EARL TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH OR PREPARE FOR HIS JUSTIFICATION
BUT WASHINGTON WITH A LESS PARTY FINDING A PLACE IN THE CURTAIN WEAKER THAN THE REST BROKE IN AND QUICKLY MADE ROOM FOR THE HORSE TO FOLLOW
THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT AT KEINTON IN THE COUNTY OF WARWICK
MAJOR-GENERAL CHIDLEY WHO COMMANDED THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY FOR STAMFORD KEPT AT A DISTANCE FAILED NOT IN HIS DUTY
TRADITIONS REMAIN OF MEN PARTICULARLY OF OUGHTRED THE MATHEMATICIAN WHO DIED OF PLEASURE WHEN INFORMED OF THIS HAPPY AND SURPRISING EVENT
AND A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED TO REASON WITH THE PROTECTOR AND TO OVERCOME THOSE SCRUPLES WHICH HE PRETENDED AGAINST ACCEPTING SO LIBERAL AN OFFER
NOR WAS HIS INSOLENCE EVER TAKEN NOTICE OF
HE HAD NOT THE DISPOSAL OF OFFICES

MR CARTE HAS PUBLISHED A WHOLE SERIES OF THE KING'S CORRESPONDENCE WITH ORMOND FROM THE TIME THAT GLAMORGAN CAME INTO IRELAND

MILTON COMPARES ITS EFFECTS TO THOSE WHICH WERE WROUGHT ON THE TUMULTUOUS ROMANS BY ANTHONY'S READING TO THEM THE WILL OF CAESAR
OTHERS ASTONISHED AT SUCH SYMPTOMS OF SECRET TREACHERY LEFT THEIR HOUSES OR REMAINED QUIET
I MAY ADD THAT CHARLES WHEN HE ASSERTED THAT PROTESTATION IN THE COUNCIL BOOKS BEFORE HIS COUNCIL SURELY THOUGHT HE HAD REASON TO JUSTIFY HIS CONDUCT
SIR DAVID FOULIS WAS FINED FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS CHIEFLY BECAUSE HE HAD DISSUADED A FRIEND FROM COMPOUNDING WITH THE COMMISSIONERS OF KNIGHTHOOD RUSH
BUT BESIDES THAT THIS CONDUCT SEEMS TO CONTRADICT THE CHARACTER OF THE KING IT IS ON OTHER ACCOUNTS TOTALLY UNWORTHY OF CREDIT
THE CASE MAY BE THAT IT IS THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD THAT DOTH LEAD MEN IN DARKNESS
AFTER THE CESSATION WITH THE IRISH REBELS THE KING WAS DESIROUS OF CONCLUDING A FINAL PEACE WITH THEM AND OBTAINING THEIR ASSISTANCE IN ENGLAND
AND WHEN THIS PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED NO NOBLEMAN POSSESSED MORE GENERAL FAVOR AND AUTHORITY
AND RATHER TO BRING ON A VIOLENT AND VISIBLE SUBVERSION OF GOVERNMENT THAN LEND THEIR AUTHORITY TO THOSE ILLEGAL AND SANGUINARY MEASURES WHICH WERE PROJECTED
SPAIN FROM BIGOTRY FURNISHED THE IRISH WITH SOME SUPPLIES OF MONEY AND ARMS
THAT NOBLEMAN ENTERED INTO AN ENGAGEMENT WITH GUSTAVUS
NOT TO STOP THE HANDS OF THESE MURDERERS BUT TO ENFORCE THEIR BLOWS AND TO STEEL THEIR HEARTS AGAINST EVERY MOVEMENT OF HUMAN OR SOCIAL SYMPATHY
WE MUST ONLY BE CAUTIOUS NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENEROUS ZEAL FOR LIBERTY NOT HASTILY TO ASCRIBE TO HIM THE PRAISES OF A GOOD CITIZEN
AND BY OTHER LAWS OF THIS REALM IT IS PROVIDED THAT NONE SHOULD BE CHARGED BY ANY CHARGE OR IMPOSITION CALLED A BENEVOLENCE OR BY SUCH LIKE CHARGE
THE VIEWS THEREFORE OF THE LAST PARLIAMENT WERE IMMEDIATELY ADOPTED
THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS INTERESTS
THESE MEN WHO POSSESSED LITTLE OF THE TRUE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY KNEW HOW TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF IT
THE POMP THE DIGNITY THE CEREMONY OF THIS TRANSACTION CORRESPONDED TO THE GREATEST CONCEPTION THAT IS SUGGESTED IN THE ANNALS OF HUMAN KIND
SIR JOHN GRANVILLE HOPING THAT THE GENERAL WOULD ENGAGE IN THE KING'S SERVICE SENT INTO SCOTLAND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER A CLERGYMAN DR MONK WHO CARRIED HIM A LETTER AND INVITATION FROM THE KING
K

A CHANGE OF MINISTERS AS WELL AS OF MEASURES WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED ON
MUCH MORE WHERE IT STANDS IN OPPOSITION TO CIVIL ESTABLISHMENTS
AND BECAUSE SUBSIDIES WOULD BE LEVIED TOO SLOWLY FOR SO URGENT AN OCCASION MONEY WAS BORROWED FROM THE CITIZENS UPON THE SECURITY OF PARTICULAR MEMBERS
HE WAS ENGAGED IN CRIMES FROM THE PROSPECT OF SOVEREIGN POWER A TEMPTATION WHICH IS IN GENERAL IRRESISTIBLE TO HUMAN NATURE
AND THOUGH STRONGLY INFECTED WITH PREJUDICES OR PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM RELIGIOUS AND PARTY ZEAL HE SEEMS NEVER IN THE COURSE OF HIS PUBLIC CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN DIVERTED BY PRIVATE INTEREST OR AMBITION FROM ADHERING STRICTLY TO THESE PRINCIPLES
HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY ST ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE UNUSUAL FORM ALONE OF THE ANSWER MUST EXCITE THEIR ATTENTION
THIS HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH LIKE ALL THE PRECEDING DURING THE REIGNS OF JAMES AND CHARLES AND EVEN OF ELIZABETH WAS MUCH GOVERNED BY THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD NOT BETTER SERVE THEIR CAUSE THAN BY BRANDING AND PUNISHING THE ARMINIAN SECT WHICH INTRODUCING AN INNOVATION IN THE CHURCH WERE THE LEAST FAVORED AND LEAST POWERFUL OF ALL THEIR ANTAGONISTS
THE PREPARATIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT WERE GREAT AND MUCH EXCEEDED THE SLENDER RESOURCES OF WHICH HE WAS POSSESSED
SINCE HE HAD ENLISTED HIMSELF WITH THE OPPOSITE PARTY HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF NO VIOLENCE OR RIGOR WHICH MIGHT RENDER HIM OBNOXIOUS
BUT THOUGH THE ROYALISTS INSISTED ON THESE PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF WAR THEY WERE OBLIGED TO OWN THAT THE PROGRESS OF CIVIL COMMOTIONS HAD SOMEWHAT ABATED THE FORCE AND EVIDENCE OF THIS REASONING
THEY DO THEREFORE HUMBLY PRAY YOUR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THAT NO MAN HEREAFTER BE COMPELLED TO MAKE OR YIELD ANY GIFT LOAN BENEVOLENCE TAX OR SUCH LIKE CHARGE WITHOUT COMMON CONSENT BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT

HAVING GOT SIX FINE FRIESLAND COACH HORSES AS A PRESENT FROM THE COUNT OF OLDENBURGH HE UNDERTOOK FOR HIS AMUSEMENT TO DRIVE THEM ABOUT HYDE PARK HIS SECRETARY THURLOE BEING IN THE COACH
AND THEY KEPT IN A BODY APART UNDER KER
THE PRESBYTERIANS IMAGINING THAT SUCH CLEAR AND CERTAIN TENETS AS THEY THEMSELVES ADOPTED COULD BE REJECTED ONLY FROM A CRIMINAL AND PERTINACIOUS OBSTINACY HAD HITHERTO GRATIFIED TO THE FULL THEIR BIGOTED ZEAL IN A LIKE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE
AND AIDED BY THE CHURCH HAD WELL NIGH PUT AN END TO ALL THE LIBERTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF THE NATION
BUT NO ALTERATION WAS MADE BY THEM ON THE FOREIGN INTERESTS OF THE KINGDOM
IT SEEMED EVEN THE INTEREST OF THE PARLIAMENT TO LEAVE IN THE KING'S HAND A CONSIDERABLE SHARE OF AUTHORITY BY WHICH HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO PROTECT THEM AND HIMSELF FROM SO DANGEROUS AN ENEMY
BY A DECREE OF THE STAR CHAMBER SIR ANTHONY ROPER WAS FINED FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS FOR AN OFFENCE OF THAT NATURE THIS SEVERE SENTENCE WAS INTENDED TO TERRIFY OTHERS INTO COMPOSITION
BUT A LONG TIME WAS REQUIRED ERE THEY COULD COLLECT THEIR FORCES AND MARCH TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT
THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR BY ORDERS FROM HIS COURT INTERPOSED IN THE KING'S BEHALF
THEY WERE ALL THREE CONDEMNED AND THE TWO LATTER EXECUTED ON GIBBETS ERECTED BEFORE THEIR OWN DOORS
THAT NO BLOOD HAD EVER BEEN SHED BY HIM BUT IN THE FIELD OF BATTLE
NOT EVEN SHOES OR CLOTHES
A REASONABLE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT WAS SLAVISH DEPENDENCE
AND CONSEQUENTLY ACQUITS THE KING OF THIS TERRIBLE PLOT OF BRINGING UP THE ARMY WHICH MADE SUCH A NOISE AT THE TIME AND WAS A PRETENCE FOR SO MANY VIOLENCES
THE PATRONS OF THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT SUFFER WITHOUT A FATAL BLOW TO THE CONSTITUTION
AND HIS HOSPITALITY AS WELL AS HIS LIBERALITIES TO THE SILENCED AND DEPRIVED MINISTERS PROVED AS CHARGEABLE AS HIS FORMER DEBAUCHERIES
THIS IS THE FIRST APPEARANCE IN CHARLES'S REIGN OF SHIP-MONEY
IT WAS AGREED BY THE ADMIRAL AND GENERAL TO ATTEMPT ST DOMINGO THE ONLY PLACE OF STRENGTH IN THE ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA
AS IF HE WERE RESOLVED TO SWEEP THE SEA ENTIRELY OF ALL ENGLISH VESSELS
AND THAT THEY MIGHT INCREASE OR RATHER FINALLY FIX THE ENTIRE DEPENDENCE AND SUBJECTION OF THE KING THEY VOTED THESE DUTIES ONLY FOR TWO MONTHS
HE WAS OF A GENTLE HUMANE AND GENEROUS DISPOSITION
OUR DESIRES ARE MODEST AND JUST
TOOK ALL THE KING'S ARTILLERY AND AMMUNITION AND TOTALLY DISSIPATED HIS INFANTRY
HE CAREFULLY INVITED INTO HIS REGIMENT ALL THE ZEALOUS FANATICS THROUGHOUT ENGLAND
THE POWERS OF THE NORTHERN COUNCIL WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT HAD BEEN EXTENDED BY THE KING'S INSTRUCTIONS BEYOND WHAT FORMERLY HAD BEEN PRACTISED
WHEN CHARLES DISMISSED THE GUARD WHICH THEY HAD ORDERED DURING HIS ABSENCE THEY COMPLAINED
THE MILITIA OF THE KINGDOM WAS PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS WOULD PROMOTE ORDER AND SETTLEMENT
BUT DO AS CHEERFULLY LAY DOWN MY HEAD AT THIS TIME AS EVER I DID WHEN GOING TO REPOSE WITH ONE BLOW WAS A PERIOD PUT TO HIS LIFE BY THE EXECUTIONER THUS PERISHED IN THE FORTY-NINTH YEAR OF HIS AGE THE EARL OF STRAFFORD ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PERSONAGES THAT HAS APPEARED IN ENGLAND
AND IT SEEMED BUT JUST THAT THE CLERGY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A WAR WHICH WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE OF THEIR OWN RAISING HE BORROWED MONEY FROM HIS MINISTERS AND COURTIERS
THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS OF THE PARLIAMENT IF THIS DIMINUTIVE ASSEMBLY DESERVE THAT HONORABLE NAME RETAIN NOT THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF LAW EQUITY OR FREEDOM
THE RIGHT WING OF THE PARLIAMENT'S ARMY HAD NO BETTER SUCCESS
NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE KING'S MEASURES ON THE SUPPOSITION OF A FOREIGN WAR WHICH THEY HAD CONSTANTLY DEMANDED WERE ALTOGETHER UNEXCEPTIONABLE THEY OBSTINATELY REFUSED ANY FURTHER AID
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT FOR THE FUTURE BE EXPOSED TO AFFRONTS WHICH SO MUCH LESSENED THEIR AUTHORITY THE PARLIAMENT ERECTED A HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE WHICH WAS TO RECEIVE INDICTMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATE
A COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT WAS SENT TO REASON WITH HIM
1625 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION
TO SPEAK THE MOST HARSHLY OF HIM WE MAY AFFIRM THAT MANY OF HIS GOOD QUALITIES WERE ATTENDED WITH SOME LATENT FRAILTY WHICH THOUGH SEEMINGLY INCONSIDERABLE WAS ABLE WHEN SECONDED BY THE EXTREME MALEVOLENCE OF HIS FORTUNE TO DISAPPOINT THEM OF ALL THEIR INFLUENCE
324
AND THEIR CHAPLAINS HERE BEGAN OPENLY TO PRACTISE THE PRESBYTERIAN FORM OF WORSHIP WHICH EXCEPT IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES HAD NEVER HITHERTO BEEN ALLOWED ANY INDULGENCE OR TOLERATION
BUT THESE WERE TOO DISTANT TO BE EMPLOYED IN SO URGENT A NECESSITY
IT HAD BEEN USUAL FOR THE ROYAL PARTY ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE DISORDERS TO CLAIM ON ALL OCCASIONS THE STRICT EXECUTION OF THE LAWS WHICH THEY KNEW WERE FAVORABLE TO THEM
THOUGH SECONDED BY THE FORCE OF SPAIN AND CONDUCTED BY THE PRINCE OF CONDE THE MALECONTENTS IN A LITTLE TIME WERE EITHER EXPELLED OR SUBDUED
SO THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE HAPPY THAN THE SUDDEN EXTINCTION OF THIS RISING FLAME
AND THIS PARTY HAD EVERY NEW CAUSE OF DISGUST BEEN CAREFULLY AVOIDED WOULD SOON HAVE BECOME THE MAJORITY FROM THE ODIUM ATTENDING THE VIOLENT MEASURES EMBRACED BY THE POPULAR LEADERS
AS THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF ASSEMBLING A PARLIAMENT SUCH ACTS OF POWER IN THE KING BECAME NECESSARY
EVERY DEED OF THE PARLIAMENT ANNULLED FROM THE DAY OF THE TUMULT TILL THE RETURN OF THE SPEAKERS
A CONCESSION WHICH CHARLES UNWARILY MADE AND WHICH THENCEFORTH BANISHED ALL MUTUAL CONFIDENCE FROM THE DELIBERATIONS OF COUNCIL
NOR COULD IT POSSIBLY BE FITTED OUT ON A SUDDEN EMERGENCE WHEN THE DANGER BECAME URGENT
THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
AND IF THE SAME GRIEVANCES ECCLESIASTICAL AND CIVIL UNDER WHICH THIS NATION ITSELF LABORED HAD PUSHED THE SCOTS TO EXTREMITIES WAS IT REQUISITE THAT THE ENGLISH SHOULD FORGE THEIR OWN CHAINS BY IMPOSING CHAINS ON THEIR UNHAPPY NEIGHBORS
FROM THE TIME THAT LAUD HAD BEEN COMMITTED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ENGAGED IN ENTERPRISES OF GREATER MOMENT HAD FOUND NO LEISURE TO FINISH HIS IMPEACHMENT AND HE HAD PATIENTLY ENDURED SO LONG AN IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT BEING BROUGHT TO ANY TRIAL
MANUFACTURES PARTICULARLY THAT OF LINEN INTRODUCED AND PROMOTED AGRICULTURE BY MEANS OF THE ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH PLANTATIONS GRADUALLY ADVANCING
BUT THEY PROBABLY FORESAW THAT THE ARMY MUST IN THE END PREVAIL
MANY OF THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES HAD BEEN CAST INTO PRISON AND HAD SUFFERED BY THE MEASURES OF THE COURT
THESE NATIONAL QUESTIONS WERE CANVASSED IN EVERY COMPANY
AND EACH BEING SUPPORTED BY HIS OWN FACTION THEIR MUTUAL REPROACHES AND ACCUSATIONS AGITATED THE WHOLE CITY AND PARLIAMENT
167

BECAUSE THE GRANTING OF THAT SUPPLY WAS IN A MANNER TACITLY CONTRACTED FOR UPON THE ROYAL ASSENT TO THE PETITION
COURTEOUS AND HUMANE IN HIS BEHAVIOR

THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM
BEING THREATENED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS WITH FINES AND PROSECUTIONS THEY AT LAST COMPOUNDED THE MATTER AND SUBMITTED TO PAY HALF OF THAT DUTY WHICH WAS AT FIRST DEMANDED OF THEM IT REQUIRED LITTLE FORESIGHT TO PERCEIVE THAT THE KING'S RIGHT OF ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS MUST IF PROSECUTED DRAW ON A POWER OF TAXATION
THEY INSISTED ON THE INTOLERABLE EXPENSE TO WHICH THE NATION WAS SUBJECTED AND URGED THE NECESSITY OF DIMINISHING IT BY A REDUCTION OF THE LAND FORCES
AND FROM THE WEARINESS OF THE KING'S PARTY WHICH PROBABLY CONSISTED CHIEFLY OF THE ELDERLY PEOPLE AND MEN OF COOL SPIRITS THE VOTE WAS AT LAST CARRIED BY A SMALL MAJORITY OF ELEVEN SOME TIME AFTER THE REMONSTRANCE WAS ORDERED TO BE PRINTED AND PUBLISHED WITHOUT BEING CARRIED UP TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS FOR THEIR ASSENT AND CONCURRENCE
CHARLES EVEN AGREED TO DEPRIVE OF THEIR SEATS FOUR JUDGES WHO HAD ADHERED TO HIS INTERESTS
AND WHERE THESE COULD NO LONGER BE FOUND PIECES OF FLESH WERE CUT INTO THAT SHAPE
1 RICHARD II
A PRACTICE WHICH GAVE THEM THE HIGHEST SCANDAL AND WHICH WAS ONE OF THEIR CAPITAL OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM THAT HE SHOULD COMPLETE AND STRENGTHEN AN ORDER WHICH THEY INTENDED SOON ENTIRELY TO ABOLISH THEY HAD ACCUSED THIRTEEN BISHOPS OF HIGH TREASON FOR ENACTING CANONS WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT THOUGH FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE MONARCHY NO OTHER METHOD HAD EVER BEEN PRACTISED
THE PARLIAMENT WAS DISSOLVED
EVERY ONE HAD RECEIVED FROM IMMEDIATE ILLUMINATION A CHARACTER MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE SACERDOTAL
BASING HOUSE WAS ENTERED SWORD IN HAND
GORING DELIVERED HIS EVIDENCE BEFORE THE HOUSE
THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH ALL THESE EVENTS WERE CONDUCTED WAS MARVELLOUS AND DISCOVERED THE PASSIONATE ZEAL AND ENTIRE UNANIMITY OF THE NATION
THEN PUTTING OUT THE CANDLE HE SAID AND HERE MY FIFTH LIGHT IS EXTINGUISHED IT BECAME A PRETTY COMMON DOCTRINE AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS UNWORTHY OF A CHRISTIAN MAN TO PAY RENT TO HIS FELLOW-CREATURES
THE PRELATES HE THOUGHT ESTABLISHED REGULARITY AND DISCIPLINE AMONG THE CLERGY
BUT CHALLENGED A DEGREE OF FREEDOM BEYOND WHAT THEY EXPECTED EVER TO ENJOY UNDER ANY MONARCHY
GLAMORGAN IS EMPOWERED AND AUTHORIZED TO TREAT AND CONCLUDE WITH THE CONFEDERATE ROMAN CATHOLICS IN IRELAND
A STANDING ARMY FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND WAS ESTABLISHED OF TWENTY THOUSAND FOOT AND TEN THOUSAND HORSE
THE EARL OF ESSEX GOVERNOR AND HAMBDEN TUTOR TO THE PRINCE WARWICK P 95
THAT VAST GENIUS OF RICHELIEU WHICH MADE HIM FORM THE GREATEST ENTERPRISES LED HIM TO ATTEMPT THEIR EXECUTION BY MEANS EQUALLY GREAT AND EXTRAORDINARY
THE EXTRAJUDICIAL OPINION OF THE JUDGES IN THE CASE OF SHIP MONEY HAD BEEN PROCURED BY HIS INTRIGUES PERSUASIONS AND EVEN MENACES
THE BILL HOWEVER FOR FIVE SUBSIDIES WHICH HAD BEEN FORMERLY VOTED IMMEDIATELY PASSED THE HOUSE
AND HAVING REENFORCED HIS ARMY FROM THAT GARRISON NOW IN HIS TURN MARCHED OUT IN QUEST OF WALLER
CHARLES TOO CONSIDERED THAT THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS TITLE WERE AT THAT VERY TIME IN ACTUAL REBELLION AGAINST HIS FAMILY AND WOULD BE SURE TO INTRUST VERY LITTLE AUTHORITY IN HIS HANDS AND SCARCELY WOULD AFFORD HIM PERSONAL LIBERTY AND SECURITY
BUT IT WAS COMPLAINED OF AND PROBABLY WITH REASON THAT THE IMPARTIALITY WAS ALTOGETHER CONFINED TO THE ORDERS AND THAT THE EXECUTION OF THEM WAS ONLY MEANT AGAINST THE CALVINISTS
SPOTISWOOD OF DAERSIE A YOUTH OF EIGHTEEN SIR FRANCIS HAY OF DALGETIE AND COLONEL SIBBALD ALL OF THEM OF BIRTH AND CHARACTER UNDERWENT A LIKE FATE
THE MURDERERS OF DORISLAUS WERE NOT PURSUED WITH SUCH VIGOR AS THE PARLIAMENT EXPECTED
IN 1648
AND AT THE SAME TIME RENOUNCE FOR THE FUTURE THE POWER OF MAKING PEERS WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL
IN THE SUMMER OF 1643 WHILE THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE CARRIED ON WITH SCOTLAND THE PARLIAMENT HAD SUMMONED AN ASSEMBLY AT WESTMINSTER CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE DIVINES AND THIRTY LAYMEN CELEBRATED IN THEIR PARTY FOR PIETY AND LEARNING
SO THAT UPON THE WHOLE THE COMMONWEALTH MAINTAINED IN 1652 A STANDING ARMY OF MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND MEN
AND THE KING THOUGHT HE MIGHT SAFELY LEAVE IT AND MARCH WESTWARD AGAINST ESSEX
NO ENGLISH AUTHOR IN THAT AGE WAS MORE CELEBRATED BOTH ABROAD AND AT HOME THAN HOBBES
NOT CONTENT WITH HAVING OBLIGED THE KING TO DISPLACE LUNSFORD WHOM HE HAD APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE TOWER THEY NEVER CEASED SOLICITING HIM TILL HE HAD ALSO DISPLACED SIR JOHN BIRON A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER AND HAD BESTOWED THAT COMMAND ON SIR JOHN CONYERS IN WHOM ALONE THEY SAID THEY COULD REPOSE CONFIDENCE
THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS
AND THEY WERE RESOLVED TO REPOSE NO TRUST IN MEN INFLAMED WITH THE HIGHEST ANIMOSITY AGAINST THEM AND WHO WERE THEY POSSESSED OF POWER WERE FULLY AUTHORIZED BY LAW TO PUNISH ALL THEIR OPPONENTS AS REBELS AND TRAITORS
AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE IRISH REBELLION THEY PUT TO SALE ALL THE ESTATES OF THE REBELS AND HAD ENGAGED THE PUBLIC FAITH FOR TRANSFERRING THEM TO THE ADVENTURERS WHO HAD ALREADY ADVANCED MONEY UPON THAT SECURITY
EVERY EXPEDIENT USED BY JAMES AND CHARLES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEIR DIGNITY WE HAVE SEEN ATTENDED WITH SENSIBLE INCONVENIENCIES
ALL THESE WERE ENJOYED BY THE PEOPLE
901
BUT IT WAS NEVER ACCOUNTED EITHER CRUEL OR UNFAIR TO DESTROY FOXES OR WOLVES WHEREVER THEY CAN BE FOUND FOR THEY ARE BEASTS OF PREY AFTER POPULAR VIOLENCE HAD PREVAILED OVER THE LORDS THE SAME BATTERY WAS NEXT APPLIED TO FORCE THE KING'S ASSENT
AND ACCORDINGLY IT IS REGISTERED IN THE COUNCIL BOOKS WITH THE COUNCIL'S UNANIMOUS APPROBATION THE KING'S CABINET OPENED
GRACEFUL HARDING OF LEWES
THEY SEEM RATHER TO HAVE BEEN LOW
CROMWELL WAS SURPRISED AT THIS MOVEMENT OF THE ROYAL ARMY
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HABITS OF EASE AND STUDY HE NOW EXERTED HIMSELF IN RAISING AN ARMY FOR THE KING
HE LET GO THE CUP FELL BACK AND BOWED THRICE TOWARDS IT
AND IN COMPLAINING OF GRIEVANCES THEY MAY DRAW TO THEMSELVES EVERY POWER OF GOVERNMENT
378
THE CUSTOMS IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE CIVIL WARS ARE SAID TO HAVE AMOUNTED TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR A SUM TEN TIMES GREATER THAN DURING THE BEST PERIOD IN QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN
AND WHILE THE PRINCE COMMANDS NO MILITARY FORCE HE WILL IN VAIN BY VIOLENCE ATTEMPT AN INFRINGEMENT OF LAWS SO CLEARLY DEFINED BY MEANS OF LATE DISPUTES AND SO PASSIONATELY CHERISHED BY ALL HIS SUBJECTS
IN THIS BATTLE IT WAS EASILY OBSERVED THAT NOTHING IN MILITARY ACTIONS CAN SUPPLY THE PLACE OF DISCIPLINE AND EXPERIENCE
AND MANY OF THEM UPON THEIR REFUSAL TO DO SO HAVE HAD AN OATH ADMINISTERED UNTO THEM NOT WARRANTABLE BY THE LAWS OR STATUTES OF THIS REALM AND HAVE BEEN CONSTRAINED TO BECOME BOUND TO MAKE APPEARANCE AND GIVE ATTENDANCE BEFORE YOUR PRIVY COUNCIL AND IN OTHER PLACES
BESIDES HER DEPORTMENT AMONG HER WOMEN WAS SO SWEET AND HUMBLE AND HER SPEECH AND LOOKS TO HER OTHER SERVANTS SO MILD AND GRACIOUS AS I COULD NOT ABSTAIN FROM DIVERS DEEP FETCHED SIGHS TO CONSIDER THAT SHE WANTED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE RELIGION SEE PREFACE TO THE CHRONICLE OF DUNSTABLE P 64
THOUGH THE NECESSITY OF THEIR SITUATION MIGHT SERVE AS AN APOLOGY FOR MANY OF THEIR MEASURES THE PEOPLE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH A SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT WERE NOT DISPOSED TO MAKE THE REQUISITE ALLOWANCES
THE SCOTS WERE FAITHFUL FRIENDS AND ZEALOUS FOR PRESBYTERY AND THE COVENANT
LAMBERT DREW SOME TROOPS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO DECIDE THE CONTROVERSY
BUT BY THIS SECOND ADVANTAGE HE OBTAINED NOT THE END WHICH HE EXPECTED
WERE CLAMOROUS FOR THEIR ARREARS
THE UNIVERSAL DISCONTENT WHICH PREVAILED IN ENGLAND AGAINST THE COURT WAS ALL POINTED TOWARDS THE EARL OF STRAFFORD
COLONEL BELLASIS WHOM HE HAD LEFT WITH A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF TROOPS WAS TOTALLY ROUTED AT SELBY BY SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX WHO HAD RETURNED FROM CHESHIRE WITH HIS VICTORIOUS FORCES AFRAID OF BEING ENCLOSED BETWEEN TWO ARMIES NEWCASTLE RETREATED
THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST IN WHICH THEY DECLARED THEIR RESOLUTION TO OBEY NO COMMANDS BUT SUCH AS WERE WARRANTED BY THAT AUTHORITY BY THESE DELIBERATE ENGAGEMENTS SO WORTHY OF AN ENGLISH PRINCE AND ENGLISH NOBILITY THEY MEANT TO CONFOUND THE FURIOUS AND TUMULTUARY RESOLUTIONS TAKEN BY THE PARLIAMENT
A FAVORABLE ANSWER IT WAS PRETENDED HAD BEEN RETURNED BY HEAVEN TO THE PETITIONS OF ALL THE GODLY
HE COMMANDED A SOLDIER TO SEIZE THE MACE
WHAT THOUGH THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF THE KING AMIDST ALL HIS MISGUIDED COUNSELS MIGHT MERIT INDULGENCE OR EVEN PRAISE
THEY RENEWED THEIR FORMER VOTE OF NON-ADDRESSES
AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT EVEN AT PRESENT SUCH IS THE FORCE OF PARTY PREJUDICES THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE COOLNESS ENOUGH TO SEE THESE MATTERS IN A PROPER LIGHT OR ARE CONVINCED THAT THE PARLIAMENT COULD PRUDENTLY HAVE STOPPED IN THEIR PRETENSIONS
BE FEARED AND COURTED BY ALL FOREIGN PRINCES AND BE ADOPTED A BROTHER TO THE GODS OF THE EARTH
THOUGH ATTENDED WITH ERRORS IN SUBJECTS WHERE IT IS NOT ALLOWABLE FOR HUMAN NATURE TO EXPECT ANY POSITIVE TRUTH OR CERTAINTY
AND THOUGH OFTEN URGED BY HIS OFFICERS AS IS PRETENDED TO ATTEMPT A GENERAL MASSACRE OF THE ROYALISTS HE ALWAYS WITH HORROR REJECTED SUCH SANGUINARY COUNSELS
FOR THE SPACE OF A WEEK NO DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS APPEARED
HE URGED THAT THOUGH SUCH A STEP WOULD PROBABLY INCREASE THE INSOLENCE OF THE PARLIAMENT THIS WAS SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBJECTION THAT SUCH DISPOSITIONS MUST NECESSARILY TURN TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE
JONES HIMSELF THE BRAVE GOVERNOR OF DUBLIN DIED AT WEXFORD
AND THE HAUGHTY ST JOHN DISGUSTED WITH THIS DISAPPOINTMENT AS WELL AS INCENSED AT MANY AFFRONTS WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED HIM WITH IMPUNITY BY THE RETAINERS OF THE PALATINE AND ORANGE FAMILIES AND INDEED BY THE POPULACE IN GENERAL RETURNED INTO ENGLAND AND ENDEAVORED TO FOMENT A QUARREL BETWEEN THE REPUBLICS
BUT THE MEANS OF ATTAINING THEM HE READILY RECEIVED FROM HIS MINISTERS AND FAVORITES THOUGH NOT ALWAYS FORTUNATE IN HIS CHOICE
AND THEIR PREACHERS ON THAT DAY WERE CAREFUL TO KEEP ALIVE BY THEIR VEHEMENT DECLAMATIONS THE POPULAR PREJUDICES ENTERTAINED AGAINST THE KING AGAINST PRELACY AND AGAINST POPERY
1643 THE KING AND PARLIAMENT SENT RECIPROCALLY THEIR DEMANDS
THE GENERALITY OF THE NATION COULD NEVER HAVE FLOWN OUT INTO SUCH FURY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN NEW PRIVILEGES AND ACQUIRE GREATER LIBERTY THAN THEY AND THEIR ANCESTORS HAD EVER BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH
AND NO PROSPECT OF SUCCESS WAS ENTERTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO SO GREAT A FORCE AS WAS DRAWN TOGETHER AGAINST HIM
AND HE MADE GREAT HAVOC AMONG THEM
THE EXAMPLE WAS IMITATED BY FRANCE AFTER THE RETREAT OF THE ENGLISH FROM THE ISLE OF RHE
COBBET WHO HAD BEEN SENT BY THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY UNDER PRETENCE OF COMMUNICATING THEIR RESOLUTIONS TO MONK BUT REALLY WITH A VIEW OF DEBAUCHING HIS ARMY HE COMMITTED TO CUSTODY
AND NOTHING LESS WAS FORESEEN WHATEVER ANCIENT NAMES MIGHT BE PRESERVED THAN AN ABOLITION ALMOST TOTAL OF THE MONARCHICAL GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND
DESTRUCTION WAS EVERY WHERE LET LOOSE AND MET THE HUNTED VICTIMS AT EVERY TURN
CAPTAIN STAYNER WHOM HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST WITH A SQUADRON OF SEVEN VESSELS CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GALLEONS AND IMMEDIATELY SET SAIL TO PURSUE THEM
YET WILL I TRUST HIM BEFORE YE ALL THIS IMPRUDENCE GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE PRETENDED SAINTS

THIS BATTLE WAS THE MOST FURIOUS THAT HAD YET BEEN FOUGHT BETWEEN THESE WARLIKE AND RIVAL NATIONS
A BATTLE WAS FOUGHT MUCH TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE DUTCH
CHAPTER LVII CHARLES I
AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON THAT I CANNOT GIVE ANY OTHER ANSWER TO WHAT YOUR MAJESTY IS PLEASED TO DEMAND OF ME THE COMMONS WERE IN THE UTMOST DISORDER
BEING RESOLVED TO MAINTAIN A NATIONAL CHURCH YET DETERMINED NEITHER TO ADMIT EPISCOPACY NOR PRESBYTERY HE ESTABLISHED A NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS UNDER THE NAME OF TRYERS PARTLY LAYMEN PARTLY ECCLESIASTICS SOME PRESBYTERIANS SOME INDEPENDENTS
THOUGH THE WHOLE NATION SEEMED TO COMBINE IN THEIR HATRED OF MILITARY TYRANNY THE ENDS WHICH THE SEVERAL PARTIES PURSUED WERE SO DIFFERENT THAT LITTLE CONCERT WAS OBSERVED IN THEIR INSURRECTIONS
LAUD AND THE OTHER PRELATES WHO EMBRACED HIS MEASURES WERE GENERALLY WELL INSTRUCTED IN SACRED ANTIQUITY AND HAD ADOPTED MANY OF THOSE RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS WHICH PREVAILED DURING THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES
HIS SUBSEQUENT USURPATION WAS THE EFFECT OF NECESSITY AS WELL AS OF AMBITION
DESPAIR JOINED TO THE NATURAL GALLANTRY OF THESE TROOPS COMMANDED BY THE PRIME GENTRY OF THE COUNTY MADE THEM RESOLVE BY ONE VIGOROUS EFFORT TO OVERCOME ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES
AND MANY OF THEM WERE REDUCED BY THESE MULTIPLIED DISASTERS TO EXTREME POVERTY
AND HE ROSE TO THE COMMAND OF A COMPANY UNDER LORD GORING
BUT THE TEARS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WERE THE MOST HONORABLE PANEGYRIC ON HIS MEMORY
BUT GREAT WAS AT THIS TIME THE SURPRISE OF ALL MEN WHEN CHARLES BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT AGAINST THE AUSTRIAN DOMINIONS EMBROILED WITH HIS OWN SUBJECTS UNSUPPLIED WITH ANY TREASURE BUT WHAT HE EXTORTED BY THE MOST INVIDIOUS AND MOST DANGEROUS MEASURES
OTHERS FELL INTO CONVULSIONS OR SUNK INTO SUCH A MELANCHOLY AS ATTENDED THEM TO THEIR GRAVE
AFTER WHICH THEY WERE TO TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION HOW FAR THEY WOULD RESTORE HIM TO THE POSSESSION OF A REVENUE OF WHICH HE HAD CLEARLY DIVESTED HIMSELF
SEVERAL PERSONS IT IS SAID HAD ENTERED INTO AN ENGAGEMENT TO MURDER THE PROTECTOR WITHIN A FEW HOURS AFTER HE SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED THE OFFER OF THE PARLIAMENT
CROMWELL SOON AFTER ARRIVED IN DUBLIN WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH SHOUTS AND REJOICINGS
THE ENGLISH WERE AT THAT TIME A CIVILIZED PEOPLE AND OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS
THE SAINTS THEY SAID WERE THE SALT OF THE EARTH
IN THE NORTH LORD FAIRFAX COMMANDED FOR THE PARLIAMENT THE EARL OF NEWCASTLE FOR THE KING
NO LACE NO RUFFLES NO EMBROIDERY
683
683
624
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE COMMONS THOUGH SO MUCH AT A LOSS TO FIND ARTICLES OF CHARGE AGAINST BUCKINGHAM NEVER ADOPTED BRISTOL'S ACCUSATION OR IMPEACHED THE DUKE FOR HIS CONDUCT IN THE SPANISH TREATY THE MOST BLAMABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN HIS WHOLE LIFE
AND DESIRED THAT THEY WOULD NOT ENTER UPON NEW BUSINESS NOR CAST ANY ASPERSIONS ON HIS GOVERNMENT AND MINISTRY THOUGH THE COURT ENDEAVORED TO EXPLAIN AND SOFTEN THIS MESSAGE BY A SUBSEQUENT MESSAGE AS CHARLES WAS APT HASTILY TO CORRECT ANY HASTY STEP WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IT SERVED RATHER TO INFLAME THAN APPEASE THE COMMONS
THE COMMITTEE URGED THAT ALL THE STATUTES AND CUSTOMS OF ENGLAND WERE FOUNDED ON THE SUPPOSITION OF REGAL AUTHORITY AND COULD NOT WITHOUT EXTREME VIOLENCE BE ADJUSTED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF GOVERNMENT
THE FORMER WAS DESTINED TO OPPOSE THE KING
I DESIRE YOU SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU ENGAGE IN IT YOU SAY WELL REPLIED THE GENERAL
AND CONTAINED NOTHING BUT GENERAL DECLARATIONS THAT THE SUBSCRIBERS WOULD DEFEND THEIR RELIGION AND LIBERTIES BUT IT TENDED TO INCREASE THE POPULAR PANIC AND INTIMATED WHAT WAS MORE EXPRESSLY DECLARED IN THE PREAMBLE THAT THESE BLESSINGS WERE NOW EXPOSED TO THE UTMOST PERIL
IT WAS THE MODE OF THAT AGE TO MAKE THE PULPIT THE SCENE OF NEWS
EVEN THE ARMY WAS INFECTED WITH THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF DISCONTENT
ON THIS OCCASION THEREFORE IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONTROVERSY
FOR PROPERLY SPEAKING HE EMBRACED NO SIDE AT ALL
THE CITIZENS WERE THE WHOLE NIGHT IN ARMS
667
THE SUCCESS THEREFORE WHICH THE ARMS OF THE PARLIAMENT MET WITH AT NASEBY STRUCK A JUST TERROR INTO THE IRISH
CHARLES DESTITUTE OF ALL SUPPLY WAS NECESSARILY REDUCED TO EMBRACE A MEASURE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF REASON AND SOUND POLICY
AND IF IT PLEASE GOD BY HIS BLESSING ON THIS ARMY RAISED FOR MY NECESSARY DEFENCE TO PRESERVE ME FROM THE PRESENT REBELLION I DO SOLEMNLY AND FAITHFULLY PROMISE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD TO MAINTAIN THE JUST PRIVILEGES AND FREEDOM OF PARLIAMENT AND TO GOVERN TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER BY THE KNOWN STATUTES AND CUSTOMS OF THE KINGDOM
IT IS NOT TO BE CONCEIVED BUT CLARENDON AND WHITLOCKE NOT TO MENTION OTHERS MUST HAVE HEARD OF THE MATTER
MOST OF THEM CONTINUED IN HIS SERVICE
THE PRESBYTERIANS EXCLAIMED THAT THIS INDULGENCE MADE THE CHURCH OF CHRIST RESEMBLE NOAH'S ARK AND RENDERED IT A RECEPTACLE FOR ALL UNCLEAN BEASTS
412
412
AND WITHOUT DELAY HE CONFERRED THAT DIGNITY ON HIS FAVORITE LAUD
HERE ARE THE NAMES OF A JURY SAID TO BE ENCLOSED IN THE COUNTY OF SUSSEX ABOUT THAT TIME ACCEPTED TREVOR OF NORSHAM
THAT A PROTECTOR EXCEPT DURING THE MINORITY OF A KING WAS A NAME UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO THE LAWS
AND ACCORDINGLY HE WAS INDUCED THOUGH WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE TO GIVE THEM IN HIS ANSWER THE APPELLATION OF THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND BUT IT APPEARED AFTERWARDS BY A LETTER WHICH HE WROTE TO THE QUEEN AND OF WHICH A COPY WAS TAKEN AT NASEBY THAT HE SECRETLY ENTERED AN EXPLANATORY PROTEST IN HIS COUNCIL BOOK
TO HIM THE BENEFIT OF ALL FORFEITURES DEVOLVED
TWO OTHER VESSELS WERE SUNK AND ONE BLOWN UP
OTHERS MORE DELIBERATE DEFENDED AND PROTECTED HIM
1347
AND HAVING BEEN DECLARED PUBLIC ENEMIES BY THE COMMONS THEY MIGHT HEREAFTER BE PROSECUTED AS SUCH UNLESS THE DECLARATION WERE RECALLED BEFORE MATTERS CAME TO THIS HEIGHT CROMWELL HAD POSTED UP TO LONDON ON PRETENCE OF LAYING BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT THE RISING DISCONTENTS OF THE ARMY
WITHOUT ANY INTERVAL THEREFORE THEY ENTERED UPON BUSINESS AND BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT THEY IMMEDIATELY STRUCK A BLOW WHICH MAY IN A MANNER BE REGARDED AS DECISIVE
MANY HAVE NOT SCRUPLED TO ASCRIBE TO THAT BOOK THE SUBSEQUENT RESTORATION OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
BUT THE GOOD MATTER WHICH HIS WORK CONTAINS MAKES COMPENSATION
THE AMBITIOUS AND ENTERPRISING PATRIOTS DISDAINED TO ACCEPT IN DETAIL OF A PRECARIOUS POWER WHILE THEY DEEMED IT SO EASY BY ONE BOLD AND VIGOROUS ASSAULT TO POSSESS THEMSELVES FOREVER OF THE ENTIRE SOVEREIGNTY
THE ENGLISH TOOK TWO SHIPS VALUED AT NEAR TWO MILLIONS OF PIECES OF EIGHT
HE WORE ARMOR UNDER HIS CLOTHES AND FURTHER SECURED HIMSELF BY OFFENSIVE WEAPONS A SWORD FALCHION AND PISTOLS WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM
AFTER THE SCOTTISH CONVENTION WAS SUMMONED WITHOUT THE KING'S AUTHORITY THE FORMER EXCLAIMED THAT THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOW VISIBLE AND THAT IF SOME UNEXPECTED BLOW WERE NOT STRUCK TO DISSIPATE THEM THEY WOULD ARM THE WHOLE NATION AGAINST THE KING
BUT DURING THOSE TIMES OF MILITARY USURPATION THESE PASSIONS WERE THE SAME
WE HAVE LIVED GLORIOUSLY ABROAD TO THE WORLD
AND THOUGH SUFFICIENTLY ELATED WITH THEIR VICTORY THEY PRESERVED EXACT DISCIPLINE AND PERSEVERED IN THEIR RESOLUTION OF PAYING FOR EVERY THING IN ORDER STILL TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF AN AMICABLE CORRESPONDENCE WITH ENGLAND
AN IMPEACHMENT OF HIGH TREASON WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT UP AGAINST THE BISHOPS AS ENDEAVORING TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND TO INVALIDATE THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY WERE ON THE FIRST DEMAND SEQUESTERED FROM PARLIAMENT AND COMMITTED TO CUSTODY
ALL EFFORTS WHICH HE MADE TO UNITE THE OPPOSITE PARTIES INCREASED THE SUSPICION WHICH THE COVENANTERS HAD ENTERTAINED OF HIM AS IF HE WERE NOT ENTIRELY THEIR OWN ARGYLE WHO BY SUBTLETIES AND COMPLIANCES PARTLY LED AND PARTLY WAS GOVERNED BY THIS WILD FACTION STILL TURNED A DEAF EAR TO ALL ADVANCES WHICH THE KING MADE TO ENTER INTO CONFIDENCE WITH HIM
HE HAD A PERPETUAL REVENUE ASSIGNED HIM A MILLION A YEAR FOR THE PAY OF THE FLEET AND ARMY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT
CLEMENT WALKER'S HISTORY OF INDEPENDENCY
AND HE HIMSELF WAS SOME TIME AFTER ARRESTED AND COMMITTED TO THE TOWER
BOTH BECAUSE OF HIS INABILITY TO RESIST AND LEST HE SHOULD STILL MORE EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE REPROACH OF FAVORING THE PROGRESS OF THAT ODIOUS REBELLION
HAMILTON WAS NEXT ATTACKED PUT TO ROUT AND PURSUED TO UTOXETER WHERE HE SURRENDERED HIMSELF PRISONER
SO MUCH DISPLEASED WAS EVERY ONE AT THE EGREGIOUS IMPRUDENCE OF WHICH THEY HAD BEEN GUILTY
SOME PERSONS PARTIAL TO THE PATRIOTS OF THIS AGE HAVE VENTURED TO PUT THEM IN A BALANCE WITH THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS CHARACTERS OF ANTIQUITY
AND WHILE THEY IMPUTED TO HIM AS A CRIME EVERY DISCRETIONARY ACT OF AUTHORITY THEY DESPOILED ALL SUCCEEDING GOVERNORS OF THAT POWER BY WHICH ALONE THE IRISH COULD BE RETAINED IN SUBJECTION
THE KING THAT HE MIGHT ABATE THE UNIVERSAL VENERATION PAID TO THE NAME OF PARLIAMENT HAD ISSUED A DECLARATION IN WHICH HE SET FORTH ALL THE TUMULTS BY WHICH HIMSELF AND HIS PARTISANS IN BOTH HOUSES HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM LONDON
JOURN 26TH JUNE 1628
NOR OUGHT THE LIVES OF MEN TO DEPEND UPON GRAMMATICAL CRITICISMS OF ANY EXPRESSIONS MUCH LESS OF THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY THE SPEAKER WITHOUT PREMEDITATION AND COMMITTED BY THE HEARER FOR ANY TIME HOWEVER SHORT TO THE UNCERTAIN RECORD OF MEMORY

THIS VOTE WAS SENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS
THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
BUT REQUIRES TO BE EXPRESSLY REPEALED BY A CONTRARY STATUTE
FIFTEEN HUNDRED PRISONERS FELL INTO THE KING'S HANDS
ESSEX RETREATING INTO CORNWALL INFORMED THE PARLIAMENT OF HIS DANGER AND DESIRED THEM TO SEND AN ARMY WHICH MIGHT FALL ON THE KING'S REAR
BUT HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD REMAIN THERE AS LONG AS ONE MAN MAINTAINED HIS GROUND THE INFANTRY OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS BROKEN AND PRESSED UPON BY THE KING
BY THE SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT EPISCOPACY WAS ABJURED AS DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL TRUE PIETY
267 273
BELLASIS AND SIR JOHN HOTHAM WERE SUMMONED BEFORE THE COUNCIL
AND THE ROYAL AUTHORITY ITSELF BECAME MORE SECURE WITHIN THOSE PROVINCES WHICH WERE ASSIGNED TO IT
AND IT WERE NOT STRANGE IF EVEN MEN OF THE MOST ENLARGED THOUGHT SHOULD QUESTION WHETHER HUMAN NATURE COULD EVER IN ANY MONARCH REACH THAT HEIGHT OF DEPRAVITY AS TO WARRANT IN REVOLTED SUBJECTS THIS LAST ACT OF EXTRAORDINARY JURISDICTION
THE ROYALISTS PUT TO SWORD SIX THOUSAND OF THEIR ENEMIES AND LEFT THE COVENANTERS NO REMAINS OF ANY ARMY IN SCOTLAND
IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE THAT THEY WOULD LIVE AND DIE WITH THEIR GENERAL
SHE NOW EMPLOYED HER CREDIT AND PERSUADED THEM THAT IT WAS REASONABLE TO GIVE LARGE CONTRIBUTIONS AS A MARK OF THEIR DUTY TO THE KING DURING THIS URGENT NECESSITY A CONSIDERABLE SUPPLY WAS OBTAINED BY THIS MEANS
203 ETC PARLIAMENT
THE COURT STILL CONTINUED TO SIT AND TO FINISH THEIR BUSINESS A PRESBYTERY IN SCOTLAND IS AN INFERIOR ECCLESIASTICAL COURT THE SAME THAT WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED A CLASSIS IN ENGLAND AND IS COMPOSED OF THE CLERGY OF THE NEIGHBORING PARISHES TO THE NUMBER COMMONLY OF BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY

THE SCOTS HAVING SUMMONED IN VAIN THE TOWN OF NEWCASTLE WHICH WAS FORTIFIED BY THE VIGILANCE OF SIR THOMAS GLENHAM PASSED THE TYNE AND FACED THE MARQUIS OF NEWCASTLE WHO LAY AT DURHAM WITH AN ARMY OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN AFTER SOME MILITARY OPERATIONS IN WHICH THAT NOBLEMAN REDUCED THE ENEMY TO DIFFICULTIES FOR FORAGE AND PROVISIONS HE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE OF A GREAT DISASTER WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIS FORCES IN YORKSHIRE

AND IF I THINK THEY ARE SUCH AND WILL BE SUCH TO THEM AND ARE FAITHFUL SERVANTS AND WILL BE SO TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY AND THE LEGISLATIVE WHERESOEVER IT IS
29 TURBULENT AND SEDITIOUS TIMES FREQUENTLY OCCURRED WHEN THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED THE CONFINEMENT OF FACTIOUS LEADERS
212
212
BOOTH IMPRUDENTLY VENTURED HIMSELF OUT OF THE WALLS OF CHESTER AND EXPOSED IN THE OPEN FIELD HIS RAW TROOPS AGAINST THESE HARDY VETERANS
NOR WERE THE FORCES ON EACH SIDE MUCH DIFFERENT IN NUMBER
IT IS PROMISED BY THE LORD NOT ONLY TO MY SUPPLICATIONS BUT TO THOSE OF MEN WHO HOLD A STRICTER COMMERCE AND MORE INTIMATE CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM
AND THEY REGARDED HIS DEATH AS THE ONLY SECURITY WHICH THEY COULD HAVE BOTH FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THEIR PRESENT POWER AND FOR SUCCESS IN THEIR FUTURE ENTERPRISES
AND AFTER HE HAD INTRUSTED HIS PERSON TO THEM IN HIS UTTERMOST DISTRESS HAD BASELY SOLD HIM TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN HONOR TO HIS BARBAROUS ENEMIES
THE COMMON COUNCIL OF LONDON FLATLY REFUSED TO SUBMIT TO AN ASSESSMENT REQUIRED OF THEM
HE WAS SEIZED WITH A SLOW FEVER WHICH CHANGED INTO A TERTIAN AGUE
THEY PRETENDED TOTALLY TO ANNIHILATE HIS AUTHORITY
MANCHESTER HAVING TAKEN LINCOLN HAD UNITED HIS ARMY TO THAT OF LEVEN AND FAIRFAX
THE SUCCESSES WHICH ATTENDED MONK IN SCOTLAND WERE NO LESS DECISIVE
HAVING DESPATCHED THIS LETTER WHICH MIGHT BE REGARDED HE THOUGHT AS AN UNDOUBTED PLEDGE OF HIS SINCERITY HE MARCHED WITH HIS ARMY INTO THE CITY AND DESIRED ALLEN THE MAYOR TO SUMMON A COMMON COUNCIL AT GUILDHALL
HIS FATHER DIED WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG
AND THESE ILLS WERE ASCRIBED NOT TO THE REFRACTORY DISPOSITION OF THE TWO FORMER PARLIAMENTS TO WHICH THEY WERE PARTLY OWING BUT SOLELY TO CHARLES'S OBSTINACY IN ADHERING TO THE COUNSELS OF BUCKINGHAM A MAN NOWISE ENTITLED BY HIS BIRTH AGE SERVICES OR MERIT TO THAT UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM
SIR EDWARD WALKER'S HISTORICAL DISCOURSES P 160
A PROPORTION TO WHICH BY LAW HE WAS ENTITLED BUT WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS ALLOWED THEM TO POSSESS UPON EASY COMPOSITIONS
THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HAD ALSO FALLEN A VICTIM TO THE SEVERITY OF THE COVENANTERS
CHARLES THEREFORE ENTERTAINED HOPES THAT IF HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT HULL BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES HOTHAM OVERAWED BY HIS PRESENCE WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE
A SMALL COMMITTEE OF BOTH HOUSES WAS APPOINTED TO ATTEND THE KING INTO SCOTLAND IN ORDER AS WAS PRETENDED TO SEE THAT THE ARTICLES OF PACIFICATION WERE EXECUTED
TO COUNTENANCE THESE PROCEEDINGS HATH IT NOT BEEN PREACHED IN THE PULPIT OR RATHER PRATED THAT ALL WE HAVE IS THE KING'S BY DIVINE RIGHT
BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON
AS HE WAS NOT ESTEEMED EQUAL TO STRATFORD OR EVEN TO LAUD EITHER IN CAPACITY OR IN FIDELITY TO HIS MASTER IT WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT HIS ESCAPE HAD BEEN CONNIVED AT BY THE POPULAR LEADERS HIS IMPEACHMENT HOWEVER IN HIS ABSENCE WAS CARRIED UP TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS
THEY HAD ORDERED SOME REGIMENTS TO SERVE ON BOARD THE FLEET IN THE QUALITY OF MARINES
BY THEIR SUGGESTION A MEASURE WAS EMBRACED WHICH AT ONCE BROUGHT MATTERS TO EXTREMITY AND RENDERED THE MUTINY INCURABLE
IN HIS NAME WAS ALL JUSTICE TO BE ADMINISTERED
THAT HAVING TAKEN ARMS AND FREQUENTLY EXPOSED HIS LIFE IN DEFENCE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM HE WAS WILLING IN THIS LAST AND MOST SOLEMN SCENE TO SEAL WITH HIS BLOOD THOSE PRECIOUS RIGHTS FOR WHICH THOUGH IN VAIN HE HAD SO LONG CONTENDED
THAT THEY WOULD FREQUENTLY HEAR TWO SERMONS A DAY AND REPEAT THEM TOO AND THAT SOME TIMES THEY WOULD FAST ALL DAY LONG THIS CHARACTER MUST BE CONCEIVED TO BE SATIRICAL
THAT PRINCE NOW FOUND HIMSELF IN A BETTER SITUATION THAN AT HOLDENBY AND HAD ATTAINED SOME GREATER DEGREE OF FREEDOM AS WELL AS OF CONSIDERATION WITH BOTH PARTIES
NOTE L P
HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS DISPERSED AND HE HIMSELF WAS OBLIGED TO FLY FIRST TO THE ISLE OF MAN THENCE TO IRELAND
AND HERE I SHOULD PUT OUT MY THIRD LIGHT ETC
THEY HASTENED THEREFORE TO CROMWELL ALONG WITH ROUSE THEIR SPEAKER
WHATEVER LAW THEY DEEMED NECESSARY FOR AGGRANDIZING THEMSELVES WAS VOTED UNDER COLOR OF ENABLING THEM TO RECOVER IRELAND
THE FRENCH MINISTERS SOON FOUND IT NECESSARY TO CHANGE THEIR MEASURES
INSTEAD OF SUPPORTING THAT UNION BETWEEN LEARNING AND THEOLOGY WHICH HAS SO LONG BEEN ATTEMPTED IN EUROPE THESE TRYERS EMBRACED THE LATTER PRINCIPLE IN ITS FULL PURITY AND MADE IT THE SOLE OBJECT OF THEIR EXAMINATION
WHILE EACH REPROACHED HIMSELF EITHER WITH ACTIVE DISLOYALTY TOWARDS HIM OR WITH TOO INDOLENT DEFENCE OF HIS OPPRESSED CAUSE
AND HAD RESIGNED TO THEM THE VICTORY WHICH IN DEFIANCE OF ALL THEIR EFFORTS HE WAS STILL ENABLED TO DISPUTE WITH THEM
THEIR ENMITY HOWEVER AGAINST THE INDEPENDENTS WHO HAD PREVENTED THE SETTLEMENT OF PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN ENGLAND CARRIED THEM TO EMBRACE OPPOSITE MAXIMS IN THEIR POLITICAL CONDUCT
THAT WHILE PETITIONS FROM ESSEX AND OTHER PLACES WERE OPENLY ENCOURAGED AGAINST THE ARMY THEIR MOUTHS WERE STOPPED
IT IS NOW KNOWN FROM THE CLARENDON PAPERS THAT THE KING HAD ALSO AN AUTHORIZED AGENT WHO RESIDED AT ROME
NEXT SUNDAY AFTER THE BILL PASSED THE COMMONS THE PURITANICAL PULPITS RESOUNDED WITH DECLAMATIONS CONCERNING THE NECESSITY OF EXECUTING JUSTICE UPON GREAT DELINQUENTS THE POPULACE TOOK THE ALARM
THAT I FOR MY OTHER SINS NOT FOR MY TREASONS BE THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING A PRECEDENT SO PERNICIOUS TO THE LAWS AND LIBERTIES OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY
THE MARQUIS OF HERTFORD WAS A NOBLEMAN OF THE GREATEST QUALITY AND CHARACTER IN THE KINGDOM AND EQUALLY WITH THE KING DESCENDED BY A FEMALE FROM HENRY VII
P 293 294 ETC
AND WHAT CONFIDENCE THEY HAD THAT GOD WOULD MAKE SCOTLAND A BLESSED KINGDOM HAMILTON RETURNED TO LONDON
BUT AS THE AFFAIRS OF IRELAND BEGAN TO DECLINE AND THE KING FOUND IT NO LONGER SAFE TO VENTURE HIMSELF IN THAT ISLAND HE GAVE A CIVIL ANSWER TO WINRAM AND DESIRED COMMISSIONERS TO MEET HIM AT BREDA IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO A TREATY WITH REGARD TO THESE CONDITIONS
AND THE KING WAS ASTONISHED TO OBSERVE THAT A POWER EXERCISED BY HIS PREDECESSORS ALMOST WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WAS FOUND UPON TRIAL TO BE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CLEAREST LAWS AND SUPPORTED BY FEW UNDOUBTED PRECEDENTS IN COURTS OF JUDICATURE

WITH THE HIGHEST INDIGNATION THE AMBITIOUS PRINCE WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO THE IMPERIOUS MEDIATION OF THE TWO COMMONWEALTHS

TROMP ISSUED OUT DETERMINED AGAIN TO FIGHT THE VICTORS AND TO DIE RATHER THAN TO YIELD THE CONTEST
ALL NIGHT HE TRAVELLED THROUGH THE FOREST AND ARRIVED NEXT DAY AT TICHFIELD A SEAT OF THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON'S WHERE THE COUNTESS DOWAGER RESIDED A WOMAN OF HONOR TO WHOM THE KING KNEW HE MIGHT SAFELY INTRUST HIS PERSON
CHARLES PERCEIVING WHAT ADVANTAGE HIS ENEMIES HAD REAPED FROM THEIR COVENANT RESOLVED TO HAVE A COVENANT ON HIS SIDE
BUT WHEN WE WEIGH THE INTERNAL DERIVED FROM THE STYLE AND COMPOSITION THERE IS NO MANNER OF COMPARISON
THE DUKE OF ROHAN WHO HAD TAKEN ARMS AS SOON AS BUCKINGHAM APPEARED UPON THE COAST DISCOVERED THE DANGEROUS SPIRIT OF THE SECT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DO ANY MISCHIEF
KENNET VOL
IN RETURN FOR CHARLES'S INDULGENCE TOWARDS THE CHURCH LAUD AND HIS FOLLOWERS TOOK CARE TO MAGNIFY ON EVERY OCCASION THE REGAL AUTHORITY AND TO TREAT WITH THE UTMOST DISDAIN OR DETESTATION ALL PURITANICAL PRETENSIONS TO A FREE AND INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTION
THE MINISTERS OF THE TWO CROWNS MAZARINE AND DON LOUIS DE HARO MET AT THE FOOT OF THE PYRENEES IN THE ISLE OF PHEASANTS A PLACE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO NEITHER KINGDOM
THE ENGLISH AS HERETICS ABHORRED OF GOD AND DETESTABLE TO ALL HOLY MEN WERE MARKED OUT BY THE PRIESTS FOR SLAUGHTER
NO MAN HAD SEEN THE BLOW NOR THE PERSON WHO GAVE IT BUT IN THE CONFUSION EVERY ONE MADE HIS OWN CONJECTURE
AND SO SMALL DID THEIR NUMBER SEEM TO A SUPERFICIAL VIEW THAT EVEN SHOULD THE NATION RECOVER ITS LIBERTY WHICH WAS DEEMED NOWISE PROBABLE IT WAS JUDGED UNCERTAIN WHAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT IT WOULD EMBRACE
AS A CONSEQUENCE THE BISHOPS WERE TO BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR SEATS IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS
AND IN SUCH COMPLICATED SUBJECTS THE ALTERATION OF A VERY MINUTE CIRCUMSTANCE UNKNOWN TO THE SPECTATOR WILL OFTEN BE SUFFICIENT TO CAST THE BALANCE AND RENDER A DETERMINATION WHICH IN ITSELF MAY BE UNELIGIBLE VERY PRUDENT OR EVEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO THE ACTOR
MALIGNANTS AND ENGAGERS CONTINUED TO BE THE OBJECTS OF GENERAL HATRED AND PERSECUTION
YET IF THE PHILISTINES COME THAT IS IF ANY JUST OR IMPORTANT OCCASION DO ARISE IT CANNOT HOLD OR RESTRAIN THE PREROGATIVE
AT LAST THE GENERAL HAVING SUFFICIENTLY SOUNDED THEIR INCLINATIONS GAVE DIRECTIONS TO ANNESLEY PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL TO INFORM THEM THAT ONE SIR JOHN GRANVILLE A SERVANT OF THE KING'S HAD BEEN SENT OVER BY HIS MAJESTY AND WAS NOW AT THE DOOR WITH A LETTER TO THE COMMONS
LEAVING IT IN THE EARL'S CHOICE IF HE THOUGHT PROPER TO REMAIN NEUTER WITH THE REST OF HIS FORCES
YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE-CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT
SEE WORLD'S MISTAKE IN OLIVER CROMWELL
IN THE PUBLIC DECLARATIONS OF THE ARMY THE SETTLEMENT OF HIS REVENUE AND AUTHORITY WAS INSISTED ON THE ROYALISTS EVERY WHERE ENTERTAINED HOPES OF THE RESTORATION OF MONARCHY
BUT BETWEEN DETHRONING A PRINCE AND PUNISHING HIM THERE IS ANOTHER VERY WIDE INTERVAL
AND ACCORDINGLY IN THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF ST GILES THE DEAN OF EDINBURGH ARRAYED IN HIS SURPLICE BEGAN THE SERVICE
OF THESE MONTROSE THOUGH ABSENT WAS REGARDED AS THE HEAD

SO GREAT WERE THE ALTERATIONS MADE ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION BY THIS TREATY THAT THE KING SAID NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT HE HAD BEEN MORE AN ENEMY TO HIS PEOPLE BY THESE CONCESSIONS COULD HE HAVE PREVENTED THEM THAN BY ANY OTHER ACTION OF HIS LIFE
AND EVERY LATE MEASURE OF ADMINISTRATION TREATED WITH REPROACH AND OBLOQUY
325
IF STRAFFORD'S APOLOGY WAS IN THE MAIN SO SATISFACTORY WHEN HE PLEADED TO EACH PARTICULAR ARTICLE OF THE CHARGE HIS VICTORY WAS STILL MORE DECISIVE WHEN HE BROUGHT THE WHOLE TOGETHER AND REPELLED THE IMPUTATION OF TREASON
BURNET'S MEMOIRS OF HAMILTON
BURNET'S MEMOIRS OF HAMILTON
BURNET'S MEMOIRS OF HAMILTON
MANCHESTER WHO COMMANDED THOUGH HIS FORCES WERE MUCH SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF THE KING DECLINED AN ENGAGEMENT AND REJECTED CROMWELL'S ADVICE WHO EARNESTLY PRESSED HIM NOT TO NEGLECT SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR
THE POPULACE MORE GENEROUS AND HUMANE WHEN THEY SAW SO MIGHTY A CHANGE OF FORTUNE IN THIS GREAT MAN SO LATELY THEIR DREAD AND TERROR INTO WHOSE HANDS THE MAGISTRATES A FEW YEARS BEFORE HAD DELIVERED ON THEIR KNEES THE KEYS OF THE CITY WERE STRUCK WITH COMPASSION AND VIEWED HIM WITH SILENT TEARS AND ADMIRATION
NOR WAS IT SUFFICIENT THEY THOUGHT THAT THE KING PROMISED TO RETURN INTO THE WAY OF HIS PREDECESSORS
AND THE MORE TO OVERAWE THE CLERGY A NEW DEVICE WAS FALLEN UPON OF CHOOSING TO EVERY COMMISSIONER FOUR OR FIVE LAY ASSESSORS WHO THOUGH THEY COULD HAVE NO VOTE MIGHT YET INTERPOSE WITH THEIR ADVICE AND AUTHORITY IN THE ASSEMBLY THE ASSEMBLY MET AT GLASGOW
THOUGH SOME INCONVENIENCIES SHOULD RESULT FROM THE OBSERVANCE OF THIS MAXIM THAT WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT WITHOUT OTHER AUTHORITY TO ABOLISH A PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHED BY UNINTERRUPTED PRECEDENT AND FOUNDED ON THE TACIT CONSENT OF THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
SUCH AS MAY STAND WITH HIS HONOR
THE EXECUTION THEREFORE OF THE KING AGAINST WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS PROTESTED HAVING OCCASIONED A VACANCY OF THE THRONE THEY IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIS SON AND SUCCESSOR CHARLES II
THE KING CONVEYED TO THE JUSTICES INTELLIGENCE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE PREVENTED THE REBELLION
WHEN INTELLIGENCE ARRIVED IN IRELAND OF THE PLANS LAID FOR STAFFORD'S RUIN THE IRISH HOUSE OF COMMONS THOUGH THEY HAD VERY LATELY BESTOWED AMPLE PRAISES ON HIS ADMINISTRATION ENTERED INTO ALL THE VIOLENT COUNSELS AGAINST HIM AND PREPARED A REPRESENTATION OF THE MISERABLE STATE INTO WHICH BY HIS MISCONDUCT THEY SUPPOSED THE KINGDOM TO BE FALLEN
AND DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE HE RETAINED AN AFFECTION FOR BUCKINGHAM'S FRIENDS AND A PREJUDICE AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
AND WHAT IF HE RECEIVE A DEFEAT FROM THE REBEL ARMY
PARTICULARLY INTO THE SCOTS AND THE RELIGIOUS PURITANS TO WHOSE ASSISTANCE AND GOOD OFFICES THEY WERE ALREADY SO MUCH BEHOLDEN
WHERE IT IS PRETENDED HE TALKED OF RAISING AND THEN DESTROYING CROMWELL
ALL THESE ARE REASONS OF STATE NOT TOPICS OF LAW
A PRACTICE WHICH AS IT DIMINISHED THE AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN WAS WILLINGLY EMBRACED AND WAS AFTERWARDS CONTINUED BY THE COMMONS WITH REGARD TO EVERY BRANCH OF REVENUE WHICH THEY GRANTED TO THE KING
1 ONLY SAYS THAT THE COMMONS BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT IT HAD BEEN SPLEEN IN BUCKINGHAM NOT ZEAL FOR PUBLIC GOOD WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO BREAK THE SPANISH MATCH
AND IT WAS ONLY BY CUNNING AND DECEIT AT FIRST AND AFTERWARDS BY MILITARY VIOLENCE THAT THE INDEPENDENTS COULD ENTERTAIN ANY HOPES OF SUCCESS
AND FAIRFAX INSTIGATED BY IRETON TO WHOM CROMWELL IN HIS ABSENCE HAD CONSIGNED OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PASSIVE GENERAL SEIZED SIR CHARLES AND RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM INSTANT SACRIFICES TO MILITARY JUSTICE
THEIR SERVANTS UNDER THE COMMAND OF SIR WILLIAM KILLIGREW MADE ANOTHER TROOP AND ALWAYS MARCHED WITH THEIR MASTERS CLARENDON VOL
AND THE ARTICLE CONCERNING THE SAFETY OF THE KING'S PERSON WAS OMITTED
HE CEASED NOT HOWEVER THOUGH BOTH GAGGED AND PILLORIED TO STAMP WITH HIS FOOT AND GESTICULATE IN ORDER TO SHOW THE PEOPLE THAT IF HE HAD IT IN HIS POWER HE WOULD STILL HARANGUE THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THESE STEPS WHICH WERE TAKING TOWARDS THE REESTABLISHMENT OF MONARCHY MONK STILL MAINTAINED THE APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR A COMMONWEALTH AND HITHERTO ALLOWED NO CANAL OF CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE KING TO BE OPENED
TO PROVIDE FOR HIS SAFETY HE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIS COMPANIONS
THEIR NAMES WERE HOLLIS SIR PHILIP STAPLETON SIR WILLIAM LEWIS SIR JOHN CLOTWORTHY SIR WILLIAM WALLER SIR JOHN MAYNARD MASSEY GLYN LONG HARLEY AND NICHOLS THESE WERE THE VERY LEADERS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN PARTY
THESE MEN BY THEIR CREDIT AND AUTHORITY WHICH WAS THEN VERY HIGH HAD AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR SUPPORTED THE PARLIAMENT
SO THEY CALLED THE PARLIAMENT IN ALLUSION TO THAT PART OF THE ANIMAL BODY
AND AS THEY RENOUNCED BY PRINCIPLE THE USE OF ARMS THEY NEVER MADE SUCH A FIGURE IN PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS AS TO ENTER INTO ANY PART OF OUR NARRATIVE
INSOMUCH THAT SOME FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO JOIN THEIR FRIENDS AND OTHERS WERE DISMAYED WITH FEAR AND SUPERSTITION AT AN INCIDENT SO UNUSUAL DURING THE SUMMER SEASON
408
FOR HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE HAD ANY DELIBERATE PLAN IN ALL THESE ALTERATIONS
AND ONLY BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT BE MADE AS MODERATE AS POSSIBLE

THE STATES OVERWHELMED WITH THE EXPENSE OF THE WAR TERRIFIED BY THEIR LOSSES AND MORTIFIED BY THEIR DEFEATS WERE EXTREMELY DESIROUS OF AN ACCOMMODATION WITH AN ENEMY WHOM THEY FOUND BY EXPERIENCE TOO POWERFUL FOR THEM
WHEN THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS WHO JOINED TO A COMMITTEE OF ENGLISH LORDS AND COMMONS HAD MANAGED THE WAR WERE READY TO DEPART IT WAS PROPOSED IN PARLIAMENT TO GIVE THEM THANKS FOR THEIR CIVILITIES AND GOOD OFFICES
CROMWELL AND IRETON INFORMED OF THIS INTENTION ENDEAVORED TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THE LORD HAD REJECTED THE KING
AND WOULD ENTER INTO NO FURTHER CONFIDENCE WITH HIM BUT SENT HIM AWAY WITH THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY
406
AND THAT THE CHURCH WAS WILLING TO HAVE GRANTED MORE LIBERTY THAN WOULD BE ALLOWED BY THE COMMONS
FOR WILL THE WEAK LIMITATIONS OF RESPECT AND DECORUM BE SUFFICIENT TO RESTRAIN HUMAN AMBITION WHICH SO FREQUENTLY BREAKS THROUGH ALL THE PRESCRIPTIONS OF LAW AND JUSTICE
FOR MY RESIDENCE NEAR YOU I WISH IT MIGHT BE SAFE AND HONORABLE AND THAT I HAD NO CAUSE TO ABSENT MYSELF FROM WHITEHALL
AFTER THE DEATH OF WILLIAM PRINCE OF ORANGE WHICH WAS ATTENDED WITH THE DEPRESSION OF HIS PARTY AND THE TRIUMPH OF THE DUTCH REPUBLICANS THE PARLIAMENT THOUGHT THAT THE TIME WAS NOW FAVORABLE FOR CEMENTING A CLOSER CONFEDERACY WITH THE STATES
NAPLES WAS SHAKEN WITH POPULAR CONVULSIONS
A CONSECRATED KNIFE MUST PERFORM THAT SACRED OFFICE AND MUST NEVER AFTERWARDS BE PROFANED BY ANY VULGAR SERVICE COZENS LIKEWISE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING SAID THE KING HAS NO MORE AUTHORITY IN ECCLESIASTICAL MATTERS THAN THE BOY WHO RUBS MY HORSE'S HEELS."[V THE EXPRESSION WAS VIOLENT
AND FANCYING THAT HE WAS CERTAINLY FAVORED WITH INSPIRATION HE DEEMED HIMSELF TO SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TIMES TO BE A MAN ABOVE ORDINANCES AND BY REASON OF HIS PERFECTION TO BE UNLIMITED AND UNRESTRAINED BY ANY RULES WHICH GOVERN INFERIOR MORTALS
BECAUSE THE ENGLISH ROYALISTS HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE COVENANT
WITH THESE DOCTRINES THE PULPITS ECHOED
AS IF THERE WERE NOT ALREADY SUFFICIENT GROUNDS OF COMPLAINT THE KING PERSEVERED STILL IN THOSE COUNSELS WHICH FROM EXPERIENCE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENSIBLE WERE SO DANGEROUS AND UNPOPULAR
57 58
THE MODERATION AND EQUITY WHICH SHONE FORTH IN HIS TEMPER SEEMED TO SECURE HIM AGAINST RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISES
AND EACH OF THEM ENDEAVORED BY FORCED INFERENCES TO INTERPRET IT AS A CONFIRMATION OF THEIR PARTICULAR PREJUDICES
AND THE SOLDIERS THOUGH UNDISCIPLINED AND ILL ARMED WERE ANIMATED AS WELL BY THE NATIONAL AVERSION TO ENGLAND AND THE DREAD OF BECOMING A PROVINCE TO THEIR OLD ENEMY AS BY AN UNSURMOUNTABLE FERVOR OF RELIGION
FOR INDEED I MUST BE TENDER WHAT I SAY TO SUCH AN AUDIENCE AS THIS
THE KING FREED FROM THIS ENEMY SENT HIS ARMY WESTWARD UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
AND BECAUSE HE DWELT IN WALLINGFORD HOUSE THE PARTY RECEIVED A DENOMINATION FROM THAT PLACE
BUT WHETHER PILLORIES FINES AND PRISONS WERE PROPER EXPEDIENTS FOR THAT PURPOSE MAY ADMIT OF SOME QUESTION
IT SEEMS TO BE IMPLIED IN THE VERY WORDS OF THE COMMISSION
THAT MANSFELDT HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PENETRATE WITH AN ENGLISH ARMY INTO THE PALATINATE AND BY THAT QUARTER TO EXCITE THE MEMBERS OF THE EVANGELICAL UNIONS THAT THE STATES MUST BE SUPPORTED IN THE UNEQUAL WARFARE WHICH THEY MAINTAINED WITH SPAIN
AND THEY COULD BY NO MEANS BE INDUCED TO RENEW THE COMBAT
EVEN WHEN RUINED BY CONFISCATIONS AND SEQUESTRATIONS THEY ENDEAVORED TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF A CARELESS AND SOCIAL JOLLITY
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT THEIR PUNISHMENT MAY BE DEEMED THE MORE JUST BUT THE LESS PRUDENT
WHILE THE MANAGERS OF THE COMMONS DEMANDED EVERY MOMENT THAT THE DEPUTY'S CONDUCT SHOULD BE EXAMINED BY THE LINE OF RIGID LAW AND SEVERE PRINCIPLES HE APPEALED STILL TO THE PRACTICE OF ALL FORMER DEPUTIES AND TO THE UNCONTROLLABLE NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION
HIS SOCIAL VIRTUES MORE VALUABLE THAN THE GREATEST CAPACITY MET WITH A RECOMPENSE MORE PRECIOUS THAN NOISY FAME AND MORE SUITABLE--CONTENTMENT AND TRANQUILLITY
THE MORE VIGOROUS OF THE UNHAPPY FUGITIVES TO THE NUMBER OF THREE THOUSAND WERE ENLISTED INTO THREE REGIMENTS
THE ARMY WHICH HAD MADE THE FRUITLESS EXPEDITION TO CADIZ WAS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
BECAUSE THEIR COUNTRY PRODUCES FEW COMMODITIES AND THEY SUBSIST CHIEFLY BY BEING THE GENERAL CARRIERS AND FACTORS OF EUROPE
1216
TO NOBODY REPLIED HIS BROTHER BUT TO PRICE WHOM I KNOW TO BE ENTIRELY IN YOUR CONFIDENCE THE GENERAL ALTERING HIS COUNTENANCE TURNED THE DISCOURSE
THE BISHOPS AND THEIR MORE ZEALOUS PARTISANS INFERRED THENCE THE DIVINE INDEFEASIBLE RIGHT OF PRELACY
BUT AS THE COVENANTERS WERE SENSIBLE THAT THIS CONSEQUENCE THOUGH IT SEEMED TO THEM IRREFRAGABLE WOULD NOT BE ASSENTED TO BY THE KING IT BECAME NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THEIR RELIGIOUS TENETS BY MILITARY FORCE AND NOT TO TRUST ENTIRELY TO SUPERNATURAL ASSISTANCE OF WHICH HOWEVER THEY HELD THEMSELVES WELL ASSURED
ORMOND ON HIS ARRIVAL IN IRELAND FOUND THE KINGDOM DIVIDED INTO MANY FACTIONS AMONG WHICH EITHER OPEN WAR OR SECRET ENMITY PREVAILED
88 V RUSH
12TH OF JULY 1644
HE PROPOSED TO SWEDEN A GENERAL LEAGUE AND CONFEDERACY OF ALL THE PROTESTANTS
THAT IN VAIN DID THAT PARTY MAKE PROFESSIONS OF MODERATION AND LENITY
THEY THREATENED THAT IF HE DELAYED COMPLIANCE THE PARLIAMENT WOULD BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY SETTLE THE NATION
MONTROSE ADVANCED STILL FARTHER TO THE SOUTH ALLURED BY VAIN HOPES BOTH OF ROUSING TO ARMS THE EARLS OF HUME TRAQUAIRE AND ROXBOROUGH WHO HAD PROMISED TO JOIN HIM
CARRINGTON P
THE ROYALISTS ALSO WERE VERY COMMONLY ZEALOTS
THE LATTER NOBLEMAN BEGAN THOSE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH WERE AFTERWARDS SO MUCH PRACTISED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE KINGDOM
AND THE FORCE AND COMPASS OF OUR TONGUE WERE THEN FIRST PUT TO TRIAL
THEY SOON ENLISTED AND ARMED FROM THE MAGAZINES ABOVE FOUR THOUSAND MEN MORE
BUT THOUGH ALL THESE REFLECTIONS OCCURRED TO THE SCOTTISH COMMISSIONERS THEY RESOLVED TO PROLONG THE DISPUTE AND TO KEEP THE KING AS A PLEDGE FOR THOSE ARREARS WHICH THEY CLAIMED FROM ENGLAND AND WHICH THEY WERE NOT LIKELY IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF THAT NATION TO OBTAIN BY ANY OTHER EXPEDIENT
VOL VII
DESPERATE PROJECTS TOO HE ASSERTED TO BE SECRETLY FORMED FOR THE MURDER OF THE KING
THESE WERE GOVERNED BY ARGYLE
GREAT COMPLAINTS WERE MADE OF VIOLENCES EXERCISED ON THE GARRISON CONTRARY TO THE CAPITULATION
THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED
COLONEL HARRISON THE SON OF A BUTCHER AND THE MOST FURIOUS ENTHUSIAST IN THE ARMY WAS SENT WITH A STRONG PARTY TO CONDUCT THE KING TO LONDON
SUCH OR MORE SEVERE WERE THE SENTIMENTS PROMOTED BY A GREAT PARTY IN THE NATION
THE QUEEN HAD GREAT INTEREST WITH THE CATHOLICS BOTH FROM THE SYMPATHY OF RELIGION AND FROM THE FAVORS AND INDULGENCES WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PROCURE TO THEM
THE EARLS OF ROTHES CASSILS MONTROSE LOTHIAN THE LORDS LINDESEY LOUDEN YESTER BALMERINO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES IN THAT PARTY
THEY AGAIN EXCITED THE PEOPLE BY NEVER-CEASING INQUIRIES AFTER CONSPIRACIES BY REPORTS OF INSURRECTIONS BY FEIGNED INTELLIGENCE OF INVASIONS FROM ABROAD BY DISCOVERIES OF DANGEROUS COMBINATIONS AT HOME AMONG PAPISTS AND THEIR ADHERENTS
AS HE CHIEFLY FOLLOWS HIS OWN GENIUS AND DISPOSITION HIS MEASURES ARE HENCEFORTH LESS RASH AND HASTY
BUT WHAT IS THERE IN COMMON BETWEEN SUCH SUPPOSITIONS AND THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE NATION
THE PRESBYTERIANS CHECKED THE PROGRESS OF THE COURT AND CLERGY AND EXCITED BY CANT AND HYPOCRISY THE POPULACE FIRST TO TUMULTS THEN TO WAR AGAINST THE KING THE PEERS AND ALL THE ROYALISTS
THE SEQUEL WILL SUFFICIENTLY DISPLAY THEIR ABSURDITY
BUT BESIDES THE TREATIES AND ENGAGEMENTS WHICH HE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH HOLLAND AND DENMARK THE KING'S THOUGHTS WERE AT THIS TIME AVERSE TO PACIFIC COUNSELS

AND HAVING OBTAINED A REGIMENT WAS SOON TAKEN NOTICE OF FOR HIS MILITARY SKILL AND FOR HIS CALM AND DELIBERATE VALOR

SHOULD THE KING THEY SAID BE ABLE BY FORCE OF ARMS TO PREVAIL OVER THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND AND REESTABLISH HIS AUTHORITY IN THAT POWERFUL KINGDOM HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RETRACT ALL THOSE CONCESSIONS WHICH WITH SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OF VIOLENCE AND INDIGNITY THE SCOTS HAVE EXTORTED FROM HIM
BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES OF IT IN THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH
THEIR SUDDEN PROFULGATION PREVENTED THEM FROM BRINGING THEIR PRETENSIONS TO A FULL CONCLUSION
AND WAS SENT BACK WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE ANSWER

A TRUCE WITH THE REBELS HE THOUGHT WOULD ENABLE HIS SUBJECTS IN IRELAND TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN SUPPORT AND WOULD PROCURE HIM THE ASSISTANCE OF THE ARMY AGAINST THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
CHARLES ENCAMPED AT THE TORWOOD
NOR WAS IT REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT STRAFFORD HAD USED ANY ART TO PROCURE THOSE EXTENSIVE POWERS
AND AFFAIRS REMAINED FOR SOME TIME IN SUSPENSE BETWEEN THESE OPPOSITE ARMIES DURING THIS WINTER AND SPRING OTHER PARTS OF THE KINGDOM HAD ALSO BEEN INFESTED WITH WAR

TO CARRY FURTHER THE TRIUMPH OVER THEIR SOVEREIGN THESE TERMS SO IGNOMINIOUS TO HIM WERE ORDERED BY A VOTE OF PARLIAMENT TO BE READ IN ALL CHURCHES UPON A DAY OF THANKSGIVING APPOINTED FOR THE NATIONAL PACIFICATION ALL THEIR CLAIMS FOR THE RESTRICTION OF PREROGATIVE WERE AGREED TO BE RATIFIED
RUSH VII
AND MUCH REGARD HAD BEEN PAID TO THE KING AND MANY GOOD OFFICES PERFORMED TO HIM BOTH BY THE PUBLIC AND BY MEN OF ALL RANKS IN THE UNITED PROVINCES
THE OFFICERS HASTENED TO RICHARD AND DEMANDED OF HIM THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PARLIAMENT
AND UPON THE WHOLE THE ORATOR CONCLUDED THAT IT BELONGED TO THE HOUSE TO PROVIDE A REMEDY PROPORTIONABLE TO THE DISEASE AND TO PREVENT THE FURTHER MISCHIEFS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INFLUENCE WHICH THIS MAN HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE MEASURES AND COUNSELS OF THEIR SOVEREIGN WHITLOCKE P
DEEPER DESIGNS EITHER IN THE KING'S FAVOR OR HIS OWN WERE FROM THE BEGINNING SUSPECTED TO BE THE MOTIVE OF HIS ACTIONS
BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND
RELIGIOUS FANATICISM FURTHER INFLAMED THESE VINDICTIVE REFLECTIONS
THE EARL OF HOLLAND LOST HIS LIFE BY A LIKE SENTENCE
IN THESE PARTICULARS PERHAPS THE ROMAN DO NOT MUCH SURPASS THE ENGLISH WORTHIES
ONE LOCKIER HAVING CARRIED HIS SEDITION FURTHER WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH
AND THE VANQUISHED WERE NOW OBLIGED TO GIVE HIM SOME MORE AUTHORITY AND APPLY TO HIM FOR SUPPORT
AND THAT STRAFFORD EXPECTING LIKE TREATMENT HAD USED THIS EXPEDIENT FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO SUBDUE THE PETULANT SPIRIT OF THE MAN
IN SO HOLY A CAUSE WOUNDS WERE ESTEEMED MERITORIOUS
AND HAVING RECEIVED MANY GENERAL PROFESSIONS AND PROMISES HE HAD ALWAYS TRANSMITTED THESE PERHAPS WITH SOME EXAGGERATION TO THE KING
DESTROYING ALL LIBERTY
AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THE KING HAD NO RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY BILLS WHICH SHOULD BE PRESENTED HIM
THAT THEY HAD AS YET SHOWN NO MARKS OF REPENTANCE
HIS DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WERE THEN IN GREATER DISORDER
THOUGH SEVERAL PERSONS DESPERATE FROM GUILT AND FANATICISM PROMISED TO INVEST HIM WITH THE DIGNITY OF SUPREME MAGISTRATE AND TO SUPPORT HIS GOVERNMENT HE WOULD NOT HEARKEN TO SUCH WILD PROPOSALS
THE FOLLOWING STORY IS TOLD BY WHITLOCKE P
GOD REWARD SMART OF FIVEHURST
HE SUMMONED A PARLIAMENT
442
A NECESSARY EXPEDIENT FOR BESTOWING OLDER AND DISCIPLINE ON THE NEW-LEVIED SOLDIERS
SUCH A COMBINATION THEY KNEW IF NOT CHECKED IN ITS FIRST APPEARANCE MUST BE ATTENDED WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES AND MUST SOON EXALT THE MILITARY ABOVE THE CIVIL AUTHORITY
UPON THE REDUCTION OF THE LATTER KINGDOM MONK WAS LEFT WITH THE SUPREME COMMAND
MONTREVILLE THE FRENCH MINISTER INTERESTED FOR THE KING MORE BY THE NATURAL SENTIMENTS OF HUMANITY THAN ANY INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIS COURT WHICH SEEMED RATHER TO FAVOR THE PARLIAMENT HAD SOLICITED THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS TO GIVE PROTECTION TO THEIR DISTRESSED SOVEREIGN
BECAUSE CHRIST HAD PURCHASED THEM AT AS DEAR A RATE AND IN THE FREE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST CONSISTS EQUALLY THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH SEXES
HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES
SHOULD HE FAIL OF THESE DURABLE ACQUISITIONS THE INDIAN TREASURES WHICH MUST EVERY YEAR CROSS THE OCEAN TO REACH SPAIN WERE HE THOUGHT A SURE PREY TO THE ENGLISH NAVY AND WOULD SUPPORT HIS MILITARY FORCE WITHOUT HIS LAYING NEW BURDENS ON THE DISCONTENTED PEOPLE
THE KING COULD NOT HOPE TO REMAIN LONG CONCEALED AT TICHFIELD
NAY EVEN JUSTICE AND LENITY OF ADMINISTRATION NOTWITHSTANDING SOME VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS
THE COMMONS HAD ALWAYS CLAIMED AS THEIR PECULIAR PROVINCE THE GRANTING OF SUPPLIES
AND STRAFFORD WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE HOUSE OF PEERS AND WHO LITTLE EXPECTED SO SPEEDY A PROSECUTION WAS IMMEDIATELY UPON THIS GENERAL CHARGE ORDERED INTO CUSTODY WITH SEVERAL SYMPTOMS OF VIOLENT PREJUDICE IN HIS JUDGES AS WELL AS IN HIS PROSECUTORS
I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER WITH INDIGNATION AND WITH SCORN RETURN YOU THIS ANSWER
OR RATHER HAD IN A GREAT MEASURE GONE OVER TO THE SIDE OF FACTION AND AUTHORIZED THE SPIRIT OF OPPOSITION AND REBELLION
BY FINISHING THE SESSION WITH A DISSOLUTION INSTEAD OF A PROROGATION HE SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSED HIS DISPLEASURE AT THEIR CONDUCT
THE GENERAL BEHAVIOR AND DEPORTMENT OF THIS MAN WHO HAD BEEN RAISED FROM A VERY PRIVATE STATION WHO HAD PASSED MOST OF HIS YOUTH IN THE COUNTRY AND WHO WAS STILL CONSTRAINED SO MUCH TO FREQUENT BAD COMPANY WAS SUCH AS MIGHT BEFIT THE GREATEST MONARCH
42

THERE FOLLOWED A BOND OF UNION BY WHICH THE SUBSCRIBERS OBLIGED THEMSELVES TO RESIST RELIGIOUS INNOVATIONS AND TO DEFEND EACH OTHER AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION WHATSOEVER
THE FRENCH KING MADE A SOLEMN RENUNCIATION OF EVERY SUCCESSION WHICH MIGHT ACCRUE TO HIM IN RIGHT OF HIS CONSORT
74 75
THE ROMAN PONTIFF WHOSE WEAKNESS AND WHOSE PRIDE EQUALLY PROVOKED ATTACKS DREADED INVASION FROM A POWER WHICH PROFESSED THE MOST INVETERATE ENMITY AGAINST HIM AND WHICH SO LITTLE REGULATED ITS MOVEMENTS BY THE USUAL MOTIVES OF INTEREST AND PRUDENCE
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN CALLING OVER THE COURT WHEN THE CRIER PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF FAIRFAX WHICH HAD BEEN INSERTED IN THE NUMBER A VOICE CAME FROM ONE OF THE SPECTATORS AND CRIED HE HAS MORE WIT THAN TO BE HERE WHEN THE CHARGE WAS READ AGAINST THE KING IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND THE SAME VOICE EXCLAIMED NOT A TENTH PART OF THEM AXTEL THE OFFICER WHO GUARDED THE COURT GIVING ORDERS TO FIRE INTO THE BOX WHENCE THESE INSOLENT SPEECHES CAME IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT LADY FAIRFAX WAS THERE AND THAT IT WAS SHE WHO HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO UTTER THEM
210
210
210
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE REASONS THE PREJUDICED JUDGES FOUR EXCEPTED GAVE SENTENCE IN FAVOR OF THE CROWN
MEANWHILE THE PARLIAMENT WAS VERY INDUSTRIOUS IN PUBLISHING FROM TIME TO TIME THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM HAMMOND
THOUGH NINETY-ONE MEMBERS HAD STILL THE COURAGE TO OPPOSE
IT WAS REQUIRED THAT WHOEVER HAD BORNE ARMS FOR THE KING SHOULD FORFEIT THE TENTH OF THEIR ESTATES
BUT WITH REGARD TO THE GENUINENESS OF THAT PRODUCTION IT IS NOT EASY FOR AN HISTORIAN TO FIX ANY OPINION WHICH WILL BE ENTIRELY TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION
AND MONEY WAS LEVIED UPON THE COUNTIES FOR THE PAYMENT OF THEIR QUARTERS THE SOLDIERS WERE BILLETED UPON PRIVATE HOUSES CONTRARY TO CUSTOM WHICH REQUIRED THAT IN ALL ORDINARY CASES THEY SHOULD BE QUARTERED IN INNS AND PUBLIC HOUSES THOSE WHO HAD REFUSED OR DELAYED THE LOAN WERE SURE TO BE LOADED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE DANGEROUS AND DISORDERLY GUESTS
IMMEDIATELY HIS COURTIERS AND GENERALS FLUNG THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR TO RECOVER IT
HE JOINED HIS GOOD OFFICES TO THOSE OF FRANCE AND MEDIATED A PEACE BETWEEN THE KINGS OF SWEDEN AND POLAND IN HOPES OF ENGAGING THE FORMER TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THE OPPRESSED PROTESTANTS IN THE EMPIRE
I HAVE FOUND REFRESHMENT AND MERCY IN SUCH A WAY."--MILTON'S STATE PAPERS P
THIS CLERGYMAN WHO WAS DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH WAS EXTREMELY ZEALOUS FOR ECCLESIASTICAL CEREMONIES
RETURNED AGAIN TO LONDON
HER DEATH WHICH FOLLOWED SOON AFTER GAVE NEW EDGE TO EVERY WORD WHICH SHE HAD UTTERED
WHOEVER WAS REFUSED ANY DEMAND JUSTIFIED HIS ANGER BY THE SPECIOUS COLORS OF CONSCIENCE AND OF DUTY
WE DID SO
NO FURTHER INTERCOURSE WAS ALLOWED BETWEEN THEM THE KING WAS INSTANTLY HURRIED AWAY
AND WHITHER ARE THEY FLED NALSON VOL
AND MANY OF THE PRIVATE MEN AS WELL AS OFFICERS HAD NEAR A TWELVEMONTH'S PAY STILL OWING THEM
AS SOON AS THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT FOUND THAT THE TREATY BETWEEN THE KING AND THE SCOTS WOULD PROBABLY TERMINATE IN AN ACCOMMODATION THEY MADE PREPARATIONS FOR A WAR WHICH THEY SAW WOULD IN THE END PROVE INEVITABLE
HE JOINED NOT THE REBELS TILL TWO YEARS AFTER
EASTER-DAY WAS BY PROCLAMATION APPOINTED FOR THE FIRST READING OF THE SERVICE IN EDINBURGH
NOR DID HE FORESEE THAT THE ECCLESIASTICAL POWER WHICH HE EXALTED NOT ADMITTING OF ANY PRECISE BOUNDARY MIGHT IN TIME BECOME MORE DANGEROUS TO PUBLIC PEACE AND NO LESS FATAL TO ROYAL PREROGATIVE THAN THE OTHER
THEY INFORMED HIM THAT THEY HAD NO POWER OF DEBATE
292
292
AND EVERY ONE SPAKE WITH DISAPPROBATION OF THE LICENTIOUSNESS OF THE GIDDY MULTITUDE IT WAS NOT THOUGHT SAFE HOWEVER TO HAZARD A NEW INSULT BY ANY NEW ATTEMPT TO READ THE LITURGY
THEIR PRISONERS SIR ROBERT SPOTISWOOD SECRETARY OF STATE AND SON TO THE LATE PRIMATE SIR PHILIP NISBET SIR WILLIAM HOLLO COLONEL NATHANIEL GORDON ANDREW GUTHRY SON OF THE BISHOP OF MURRAY WILLIAM MURRAY SON OF THE EARL OF TULLIBARDINE WERE CONDEMNED AND EXECUTED
AND THAT LAUD'S SCHEME WAS TO LEAD BACK THE ENGLISH BY GRADUAL STEPS TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
AND ATTACKING THE PARTY EMPLOYED IN REPAIRING THE FORT HE TOTALLY ROUTED THEM PURSUED THE ADVANTAGE AND FELL IN WITH THE ARMY WHICH HAD NEGLECTED ORMOND'S ORDERS
AND HE LEVIED IT EITHER BY THE REVIVAL OF OBSOLETE LAWS OR BY VIOLATIONS SOME MORE OPEN SOME MORE DISGUISED OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NATION
AND THE JUDGES WHO PASSED IT WERE ORDERED TO MAKE REPARATION TO THE SUFFERERS NALSON VOL
AND HIS ESCAPE WAS NOT DISCOVERED TILL NEAR AN HOUR AFTER
BUT AS THE DANGEROUS DISTRACTIONS IN ENGLAND HINDERED THE PARLIAMENT FROM SENDING ANY CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE TO THEIR ALLIES IN IRELAND THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND LORD LIEUTENANT BEING A NATIVE OF IRELAND AND A PERSON ENDOWED WITH GREAT PRUDENCE AND VIRTUE FORMED A SCHEME FOR COMPOSING THE DISORDERS OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR ENGAGING THE REBEL IRISH TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF HIS ROYAL MASTER
NOT BECAUSE HE IS DESTITUTE OF OTHERS BUT BECAUSE IT IS MOST AGREEABLE TO THE GOODNESS OF HIS OWN MOST GRACIOUS DISPOSITION AND TO THE DESIRE AND WEAL OF HIS PEOPLE
AT TADCASTER HE ATTACKED THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT AND DISLODGED THEM
IT WAS PROPOSED BY THEM THAT THE GENERALS AND PRINCIPAL OFFICERS SHOULD FOR THEIR DISOBEDIENCE AND USURPATIONS BE PROCLAIMED TRAITORS BY THE PARLIAMENT
HE ENLISTED THE SONS OF FREEHOLDERS AND FARMERS
AND MIGHTY PROFESSIONS WERE EVERY WHERE MADE OF GRATITUDE AND MUTUAL RETURNS OF SUPPLY AND CONFIDENCE
THE TWO HOUSES BEING UNDER RESTRAINT THEY WERE RESOLVED THEY SAID TO VINDICATE AGAINST THE SEDITIOUS CITIZENS THE INVADED PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT AND RESTORE THAT ASSEMBLY TO ITS JUST FREEDOM OF DEBATE AND COUNSEL
BUT THAT DONE THE SAID COMMISSIONERS DISCHARGE THE SAID EARL OF GLAMORGAN BOTH IN HONOR AND CONSCIENCE OF ANY FURTHER ENGAGEMENT TO THEM THEREIN
LET US BUT CONSIDER WHO THE PERSONS ARE THAT COMPOSE THE FACTIONS NOW SO FURIOUSLY ENGAGED IN ARMS
ABOVE ALL THE TOWERING SPIRIT OF RICHELIEU INCAPABLE OF REST PROMISED AN ACTIVE AGE AND GAVE INDICATIONS OF GREAT REVOLUTIONS THROUGHOUT ALL EUROPE
AND THEY WERE SWORN TO INFORM AGAINST ANY ONE WHO ACTED CONTRARY TO THE ECCLESIASTICAL CANONS SUCH A MEASURE THOUGH PRACTISED DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH GAVE MUCH OFFENCE AS RESEMBLING TOO NEARLY THE PRACTICE OF THE ROMISH INQUISITION
223 229 230 ETC
IF THE POWER OF THE MILITIA SAID THE OPPOSITE PARTY BE INTRUSTED TO THE KING IT WOULD NOT NOW BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ABUSE THAT AUTHORITY
AND ALL PAID COURT TO A PARTY WHICH THEY FORESAW WAS SOON TO GOVERN THE NATION
AN ADDITIONAL REVENUE WAS DEMANDED FROM PARLIAMENT THE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY OF ENGLAND INCREASED EXTREMELY DURING THE PEACEABLE PERIOD OF CHARLES'S REIGN

THAT PLURALITIES BE ABOLISHED
IN THIS DILEMMA MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE
SIR HENRY VANE SECRETARY HAD TAKEN SOME NOTES OF A DEBATE IN COUNCIL AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE LAST PARLIAMENT
THE FIRM AND UNDAUNTED CAPEL THE MODEST AND CANDID PALMER
AND AS THE POLICY OF MEN IS CONTINUALLY WARPED BY THEIR TEMPER NO SOONER WAS PEACE MADE WITH HOLLAND THAN HE BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHAT NEW ENEMY HE SHOULD INVADE WITH HIS VICTORIOUS ARMS
FLEETWOOD'S HAND WAS FOUND TOO WEAK AND UNSTABLE TO SUPPORT THIS ILL-FOUNDED FABRIC WHICH EVERY WHERE AROUND HIM WAS FALLING INTO RUINS
HOLY HOLY IS THE LORD GOD OF SABAOTH WHEN CARRIED BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE HE WOULD GIVE NO OTHER ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS THAN THOU HAST SAID IT WHAT IS REMARKABLE THE PARLIAMENT THOUGHT THAT THE MATTER DESERVED THEIR ATTENTION

ARGYLE MADE HIS SUBMISSIONS TO THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH
LILBURNE WAS ACCUSED BEFORE THE STAR CHAMBER OF PUBLISHING AND DISPERSING SEDITIOUS PAMPHLETS
THE NEAR PROSPECT OF SUCCESS ROUSED ALL LATENT MURMURS AND PRETENSIONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO BEEN HELD IN SUCH VIOLENT CONSTRAINT
THOUGH THE WHOLE NATION WAS SUBJECTED BY THE COVENANTERS THOUGH GREAT ARMIES WERE KEPT ON FOOT BY THEM AND EVERY PLACE GUARDED BY A VIGILANT ADMINISTRATION HE UNDERTOOK BY HIS OWN CREDIT AND THAT OF THE FEW FRIENDS WHO REMAINED TO THE KING TO RAISE SUCH COMMOTIONS AS WOULD SOON OBLIGE THE MALECONTENTS TO RECALL THOSE FORCES WHICH HAD SO SENSIBLY THROWN THE BALANCE IN FAVOR OF THE PARLIAMENT NOT DISCOURAGED WITH THE DEFEAT AT MARSTON MOOR WHICH RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DRAW ANY SUCCOR FROM ENGLAND HE WAS CONTENT TO STIPULATE WITH THE EARL OF ANTRIM A NOBLEMAN OF IRELAND FOR SOME SUPPLY OF MEN FROM THAT COUNTRY
THE CLERGY SOLICITED THE PARLIAMENT THAT MORE ROYALISTS MIGHT BE EXECUTED
THE CONTROVERSY THEREFORE BETWEEN THE PARTIES WAS ALMOST WHOLLY THEOLOGICAL AND THAT OF THE MOST FRIVOLOUS AND RIDICULOUS KIND
HE FLEW TO O'NEALE'S CAMP
BY THE FLIGHT OR TERROR OR DESPONDENCY OF THE KING'S PARTY AN UNDISPUTED MAJORITY REMAINED EVERYWHERE TO THEIR OPPONENTS
SELDEN ALSO COMPLAINED IN THE HOUSE THAT ONE SAVAGE CONTRARY TO THE PETITION OF RIGHT HAD BEEN PUNISHED WITH THE LOSS OF HIS EARS BY A DISCRETIONARY OR ARBITRARY SENTENCE OF THE STAR CHAMBER SO APT WERE THEY ON THEIR PART TO STRETCH THE PETITION INTO SUCH CONSEQUENCES AS MIGHT DEPRIVE THE CROWN OF POWERS WHICH FROM IMMEMORIAL CUSTOM WERE SUPPOSED INHERENT IN IT
OR IN OTHER WORDS THE HEAT AND INDISCRETION OF HIS TEMPER MADE HIM NEGLECT THE VIEWS OF PRUDENCE AND RULES OF GOOD MANNERS
THE KING HAD AFTERWARDS FULL LEISURE TO REPENT THIS EXERCISE OF HIS AUTHORITY
IN VAIN DO THE LAWYERS ESTABLISH IT AS A PRINCIPLE THAT A STATUTE CAN NEVER BE ABROGATED BY OPPOSITE CUSTOM

ALL MEN WERE SO SENSIBLE OF THE EXTREME VIOLENCE WHICH WAS DONE HIM THAT HE SUFFERED THE LESS BOTH IN CHARACTER AND INTEREST FROM THIS UNHAPPY MEASURE
356
356
THE COMMAND OF THE SCOTTISH ARMY WAS GIVEN TO LESLEY AN EXPERIENCED OFFICER WHO FORMED A VERY PROPER PLAN OF DEFENCE
AND THAT GENERAL EXCITED BY SO STEADY A RESISTANCE ORDERED DOYLEY THE CAPTAIN OF HIS LIFE-GUARD TO GIVE THEM A THIRD CHARGE IN FRONT WHILE HE HIMSELF ATTACKED THEM IN THE REAR
HE WOULD FIND HIS PLACE OCCUPIED
HE TOLD THEM THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE ABSURD THAN FOR THEM TO DISPUTE HIS TITLE
AND GAVE FOR A REASON THAT THE ENEMY SHOULD NOT FIND HIS BODY IN ANY SLOVENLY INDECENT SITUATION
THESE PROTESTED AGAINST SO EGREGIOUS A VIOLENCE SUBVERSIVE OF ALL LIBERTY
THAT THE KING MIGHT HAVE LESS REASON TO EXULT IN THE ADVANTAGES WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED IN THE WEST THE PARLIAMENT OPPOSED TO HIM VERY NUMEROUS FORCES
HE SUPPOSED THAT GOD IN HIS PROVIDENCE HAD THROWN THE WHOLE RIGHT AS WELL AS POWER OF GOVERNMENT INTO HIS HANDS
BEING INFORMED THAT CONSPIRACIES WERE ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE MEMBERS AND SOME MALECONTENT OFFICERS HE HASTENED TO THE DISSOLUTION OF SO DANGEROUS AN ASSEMBLY
138
TO THE YOUNG DUKE TOO HE COULD NOT FORBEAR GIVING SOME ADVICE IN ORDER TO SEASON HIS MIND WITH EARLY PRINCIPLES OF LOYALTY AND OBEDIENCE TOWARDS HIS BROTHER WHO WAS SO SOON TO BE HIS SOVEREIGN
AND ESCAPING THENCE FLED TOWARDS THE COAST OF PORTUGAL
IN THE ARMY WAS LAID THE SOLE BASIS OF THE PROTECTOR'S POWER
THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE COVENANT VOWED ALSO TO PRESERVE THE REFORMED RELIGION ESTABLISHED IN THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND
WHEN EVERY THING WAS PREPARED FOR HIS EXECUTION HE WAS FOUND DEAD
HE WAS NO LESS THAN FORTY-THREE YEARS OF AGE WHEN HE FIRST EMBRACED THE MILITARY PROFESSION
TO INFLICT DEATH AT LEAST ON THOSE WHO DEPART FROM THE EXACT LINE OF TRUTH IN THESE NICE QUESTIONS SO FAR FROM BEING FAVORABLE TO NATIONAL LIBERTY SAVORS STRONGLY OF THE SPIRIT OF TYRANNY AND PROSCRIPTION
THAT WHEN STRAFFORD SHOULD LEARN THAT SO MANY OF HIS ENORMITIES WERE DISCOVERED HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD DICTATE HIS CONDEMNATION
AND HE WAITED WITH PATIENCE OBSERVING TO WHAT SIDE THEY WOULD TURN THEMSELVES
ALL KINDS OF ORNAMENT ESPECIALLY PICTURES WERE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THAT MECHANICAL DEVOTION WHICH WAS PURPOSED TO BE RAISED IN THIS MODEL OF RELIGION
THE PARLIAMENT NO DOUBT CONTINUED HE HAD DONE WISELY ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR IN ENGAGING SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBERS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF IT AND THEREBY SATISFYING THE NATION THAT THEY INTENDED TO SHARE ALL HAZARDS WITH THE MEANEST OF THE PEOPLE
HARRISON THOUGH RAISED TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY AND POSSESSED OF CROMWELL'S CONFIDENCE BECAME HIS MOST INVETERATE ENEMY AS SOON AS THE AUTHORITY OF A SINGLE PERSON WAS ESTABLISHED AGAINST WHICH THAT USURPER HAD ALWAYS MADE SUCH VIOLENT PROTESTATIONS
207
207
NO ONE SAID HE CAN BE MORE WILLING TO SEND ME OUT OF LIFE THAN I AM DESIROUS TO GO EVEN UPON THE SCAFFOLD AND DURING THE INTERVALS OF HIS PRAYERS HE WAS HARASSED AND MOLESTED BY SIR JOHN CLOTWORTHY A ZEALOT OF THE REIGNING SECT AND A GREAT LEADER IN THE LOWER HOUSE

BUT BEING A MAN OF HUMANITY AND GOOD PRINCIPLES THE VIEW OF PUBLIC CALAMITIES AND THE PROSPECT OF A TOTAL SUBVERSION OF GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO MODERATE HIS ARDOR AND INCLINED HIM TO PROMOTE PEACE ON ANY SAFE OR HONORABLE TERMS
AND IF THEIR BIAS INCLINED A LITTLE TOO MUCH AS IS NATURAL TO THE SIDE OF MONARCHY THEY WERE FAR FROM ENTERTAINING ANY DESIGN OF SACRIFICING TO ARBITRARY WILL THE LIBERTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF THE NATION
IN DEFAULT OF THE PEERS THAT THE SHERIFFS MAYORS BAILIFFS ETC SHOULD SUMMON THE VOTERS
THE NEVER-FAILING CRY OF POPERY HERE SERVED THEM IN STEAD
THE WARS BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN WERE ALSO CONCLUDED BY THE TREATY OF THE PYRENEES
AT LONDON HE WAS CONSIDERED AS THE VICTIM TO NATIONAL LIBERTY WHO HAD ABRIDGED HIS LIFE BY INCESSANT LABORS FOR THE INTERESTS OF HIS COUNTRY AT OXFORD HE WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN STRUCK WITH AN UNCOMMON DISEASE AND TO HAVE BEEN CONSUMED WITH VERMIN AS A MARK OF DIVINE VENGEANCE FOR HIS MULTIPLIED CRIMES AND TREASONS
THE EASY SUBDUING OF THIS INSURRECTION WHICH BY THE BOLDNESS OF THE UNDERTAKING STRUCK AT FIRST A GREAT TERROR INTO THE NATION WAS A SINGULAR FELICITY TO THE PROTECTOR
THE ROYALISTS BEING TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT HIM CHARLES WAS THE MORE EASILY INDUCED TO COMPLY
803 ETC
AND THE APPOINTED DAY DREW NIGH NOR HAD ANY DISCOVERY BEEN YET MADE TO THE GOVERNMENT
PART OF THE SCOTTISH ARMY WAS EMPLOYED IN TAKING POMFRET AND OTHER TOWNS IN YORKSHIRE
THE ROYALISTS HE WOULD NOT AS YET ALLOW TO JOIN HIM LEST HE MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE TO THE ECCLESIASTICAL PARTY
AND BY OVER LOOKING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TIMES SERVED RATHER TO INFLAME THAT RELIGIOUS FURY WHICH HE MEANT TO REPRESS
AND THE TWO ARMIES FOR SOME TIME ENCAMPED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EACH OTHER WITHOUT ATTEMPTING ON EITHER SIDE ANY ACTION OF MOMENT
THE DIFFICULTY CONSISTED NOT IN PERSUADING CROMWELL
COLONEL PRIDE WHO WAS RESOLVED TO CONDEMN HIM CAME INTO COURT
HE LIVED TO AN EXTREME OLD AGE YET COULD NEVER RECONCILE HIMSELF TO THE THOUGHTS OF DEATH
OR SPAIN
BUT WHILE HE WAS IN THESE STRAITS CORKE KINSALE AND ALL THE ENGLISH GARRISONS IN MUNSTER DESERTED TO HIM AND OPENING THEIR GATES RESOLVED TO SHARE THE FORTUNES OF THEIR VICTORIOUS COUNTRYMEN
THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY RETAINED AN INSPECTION OVER SEVERAL NEIGHBORING CLASSES AND WAS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF CLERGYMEN
BUT CONTRIVANCES OF THAT NATURE WERE NOT THOUGHT OF DURING THOSE RUDE AGES
THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION THE PARLIAMENT SENT HIM THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH THEY WERE WILLING TO SOME TO AN AGREEMENT
AND WITH MUCH NOISE TUMULT AND CONFUSION RAN AWAY WITH ALL THE DISHES AND DISAPPOINTED THE GUESTS OF THEIR EXPECTED MEAL BATES
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF SHIP MONEY AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THE STAR CHAMBER HAD ROUSED THE PEOPLE TO ARMS

BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED

BY MISTAKE HE FELL ON A GENTLEMAN WHOM HE TOOK FOR THE PERSON THAT HAD GIVEN HIM THE OFFENCE
AND SHE RETAINED THE GLORY OF BEING THE LAST PERSON IN THE THREE KINGDOMS AND IN ALL THEIR DEPENDENT DOMINIONS WHO SUBMITTED TO THE VICTORIOUS COMMONWEALTH 24 SEE NOTE X AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE AND GIVING THEM THANKS FOR HIS ELECTION THE LORD KEEPER IN THE KING'S NAME EXPRESSLY COMMANDED THE HOUSE NOT TO MEDDLE WITH HIS MINISTER AND SERVANT BUCKINGHAM
AND THOSE WHO NOBLY CONSPIRED HIS DEATH WERE PRINCIPALLY MOVED TO IT AS HE AFFIRMS BY THEIR INDIGNATION AT THAT ENORMITY
AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY
AND EVEN IN THE TERMS WHICH THEY NOW PROPOSED DISPLAYED THE SAME ANTI-MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLES AND THE SAME JEALOUSY OF THEIR SOVEREIGN BY WHICH THEY HAD EVER BEEN ACTUATED
HIS POPULARITY IN IRELAND WAS GREAT
AND BY AN INCONVENIENCE WHICH NATURALLY ATTENDED THE PLAN AS YET NEW AND UNFORMED OF REGULAR AND RIGID LIBERTY IT WAS FOUND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE GENERALS TO GOVERN THE ARMY BY ALL THE AUTHORITY WHICH THE KING COULD LEGALLY CONFER UPON THEM
AND BY THE SAME RULE THAT THE APOSTLES WERE EXALTED FROM THE MOST IGNOBLE PROFESSIONS THE MEANEST SENTINEL IF ENLIGHTENED BY THE SPIRIT WAS ENTITLED TO EQUAL REGARD WITH THE GREATEST COMMANDER
BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THEN PAST MIDNIGHT AND TOO LATE TO PUT IT INTO WRITING HE WOULD HAVE IT DRAWN UP NEXT MORNING WHEN HE COMMANDED THEM TO WAIT ON HIM AGAIN AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE THEM HIS ANSWER IN WRITING AS IT WAS NOW AGREED UPON
SOON AFTER A GENTLEMAN APPEARING IN THE KING'S PRESENCE CLOTHED IN MOURNING FOR SIR CHARLES LUCAS THAT HUMANE PRINCE SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING THE HARD FATE OF HIS FRIENDS PAID THEM A TRIBUTE WHICH NONE OF HIS OWN UNPARALLELED MISFORTUNES EVER EXTORTED FROM HIM
THE HOUSE OF PEERS DURING THE CIVIL WARS HAD ALL ALONG BEEN OF SMALL ACCOUNT
WHEREFORE THEN BE YE ANGRY FOR THIS MATTER
AT LAST THE GENERAL ARRIVES
TO ALL THE SOLICITATIONS OF THEIR FRIENDS FOR PARDON THE GENERALS AND PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS STILL REPLIED THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE INTENTION OF PROVIDENCE THEY SHOULD SUFFER
BY WHICH MEANS HE SAID THAT ILL-TIMED QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE PREROGATIVE WOULD FOR THE PRESENT BE AVOIDED AND THE PRETENSIONS OF EACH PARTY BE LEFT ENTIRE
THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM
ONE REGIMENT ALONE PRESERVED ITS ORDER UNBROKEN THOUGH TWICE DESPERATELY ASSAILED BY FAIRFAX
THE PATIENCE AND FORTITUDE WITH WHICH THEY SUFFERED BEGAT COMPASSION ADMIRATION ESTEEM A SUPERNATURAL SPIRIT WAS BELIEVED TO SUPPORT THEM UNDER THOSE SUFFERINGS WHICH THE ORDINARY STATE OF HUMANITY FREED FROM THE ILLUSIONS OF PASSION IS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN
NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES TILL THE PRESENT VICES AND DISORDERS WHICH PREVAIL AMONG THE SOLDIERS WERE REPRESSED BY A NEW MODEL THAT THEIR FORCES WOULD EVER BE ATTENDED WITH SIGNAL SUCCESS IN ANY UNDERTAKING
THAT IN THEIR PRESENT SITUATION NO OTHER MEASURE WITHOUT THE UTMOST INDISCRETION OR EVEN THEIR APPARENT RUIN COULD BE EMBRACED
AND EVERY NEW CEREMONY OR ORNAMENT INTRODUCED INTO DIVINE SERVICE WAS PART OF THAT GREAT MYSTERY OF INIQUITY WHICH FROM THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE KING AND THE BISHOPS WAS TO OVERSPREAD THE NATION THE FEW INNOVATIONS WHICH JAMES HAD MADE WERE CONSIDERED AS PREPARATIVES TO THIS GRAND DESIGN
21ST JUNE 1625 SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENTER UPON GRIEVANCES EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY
THE KING AFTERWARDS SHOWED TO SIR PHILIP WARWICK A DECREPIT OLD MAN WHO HE SAID WAS EMPLOYED TO KINDLE HIS FIRE AND WAS THE BEST COMPANY HE ENJOYED DURING SEVERAL MONTHS THAT THIS RIGOROUS CONFINEMENT LASTED CL
IN NO INSTANCE I MUST CONFESS DOES IT MORE EVIDENTLY APPEAR WHAT CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN IDEAS WERE DURING THAT AGE ENTERTAINED CONCERNING THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
THE DETESTATION OF FORMER USURPATIONS WAS FURTHER ENLIVENED
CHURCH LANDS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR A MILLION.[V NONE OF THESE WERE EVER VALUED AT ABOVE TEN OR ELEVEN YEARS PURCHASE.[V THE ESTATES OF DELINQUENTS AMOUNTED TO ABOVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR CROMWELL DIED MORE THAN TWO MILLIONS IN DEBT;[V THOUGH THE PARLIAMENT HAD LEFT HIM IN THE TREASURY ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
THE WHOLE PARTY WAS ROUTED AND WAS PURSUED ABOVE A MILE
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPLAUDED THIS GLORIOUS IMITATION OF THE PIETY DISPLAYED BY THEIR ANCESTORS WHO THEY SAID IN THREE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS DURING THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH HAD ENDEAVORED TO ENGAGE THE ENGLISH BY PERSUASION TO LAY ASIDE THE USE OF THE SURPLICE TIPPET AND CORNER-CAP THE CONVENTION TOO IN THE HEIGHT OF THEIR ZEAL ORDERED EVERY ONE TO SWEAR TO THIS COVENANT UNDER THE PENALTY OF CONFISCATION
AND YET THE DUTY HAD NEVER FOR A MOMENT BEEN LEVIED WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORITY
FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR HIS NATURAL CHEERFULNESS AND VIVACITY BECAME CLOUDED
I READ OF A CUSTOM SAID SIR ROBERT PHILIPS AMONG THE OLD ROMANS THAT ONCE EVERY YEAR THEY HELD A SOLEMN FESTIVAL IN WHICH THEIR SLAVES HAD LIBERTY WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO SPEAK WHAT THEY PLEASED IN ORDER TO EASE THEIR AFFLICTED MINDS
THOUGH ARTFUL IN THE PRACTICE OF COURTLY DISSIMULATION THE SANCTIFIED STYLE WAS UTTERLY UNKNOWN TO HIM
FROM 1619 TO 1638 THERE HAD BEEN COINED SIX MILLIONS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND FORTY-TWO POUNDS
AND HE MOVED THE HEARTS OF ALL HIS AUDITORS SOME FEW EXCEPTED TO REMORSE AND PITY IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE HISTORIAN WHO EXPRESSES HIMSELF IN THESE TERMS WAS HIMSELF CHAIRMAN OF THAT COMMITTEE WHICH CONDUCTED THE IMPEACHMENT AGAINST THIS UNFORTUNATE STATESMAN
WHAT SEEMED THE MOST DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCE THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF DISCONTENT HAD SEIZED THE FLEET
AND HAVING OBSTINATELY REFUSED THE MOST INVITING CONDITIONS OFFERED HIM BY THE KING AS WELL AS BY EVERY PARTY IN THE KINGDOM HE FREELY RESTORED HIS INJURED MASTER TO THE VACANT THRONE
AND ORDERS BEING ISSUED TO GIVE NO QUARTER A CRUEL SLAUGHTER WAS MADE OF THE GARRISON
BUT IT HAD BEEN CONFERRED ON HENRY V AND ALL THE SUCCEEDING PRINCES DURING LIFE IN ORDER TO ENABLE THEM TO MAINTAIN A NAVAL FORCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE KINGDOM
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY MAN OF HONOR HOWEVER HE MIGHT DISSEMBLE WITH HIS ENEMIES WOULD ASSERT A FALSEHOOD IN SO SOLEMN A MANNER TO HIS BEST FRIEND ESPECIALLY WHERE THAT PERSON MUST HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING THE TRUTH
MANY WRITERS OF THAT AGE HAVE ASSERTED 17]THAT HE REALLY INTENDED TO MAKE A PRIVATE BARGAIN WITH THE KING
WHEN THE BREACH WAS ONCE FORMED BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND CIVIL POWERS A SUPREME AND ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY FROM THAT MOMENT IS DEVOLVED ON THE GENERAL
GREAT WISDOM IT WILL BE IN YOUR LORDSHIPS AND JUST PROVIDENCE FOR YOURSELVES FOR YOUR POSTERITIES FOR THE WHOLE KINGDOM TO CAST FROM YOU INTO THE FIRE THESE BLOODY AND MYSTERIOUS VOLUMES OF ARBITRARY AND CONSTRUCTIVE TREASONS AS THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS DID THEIR BOOKS OF CURIOUS ARTS AND BETAKE YOURSELVES TO THE PLAIN LETTER OF THE STATUTE WHICH TELLS YOU WHERE THE CRIME IS AND POINTS OUT TO YOU THE PATH BY WHICH YOU MAY AVOID IT
AND HE WAS EASILY GOVERNED BY REASON OF HIS FACILITY AND OF HIS DEFERENCE TO MEN MUCH INFERIOR TO HIMSELF BOTH IN MORALS AND UNDERSTANDING
TAUGHT TO CONSIDER EVEN THE ANCIENT LAWS AND CONSTITUTION MORE AS LINES TO DIRECT HIS CONDUCT THAN BARRIERS TO WITHSTAND HIS POWER
CHARLES STILL UNWILLING TO SUBMIT TO SO CONSIDERABLE A DIMINUTION OF POWER CAME TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS AND OFFERED TO PASS THE LAW WITHOUT THE PREAMBLE
AND AS HE WAS FREE FROM THE FUMES OF ENTHUSIASM BY WHICH MOST OF THE OFFICERS ON THAT SIDE WERE INTOXICATED HE WOULD LEND AN EAR IT WAS PRESUMED TO PROPOSALS FOR ACCOMMODATION
THE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION WHICH THEY HAD MADE IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE KING IN HIS WAR AGAINST THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WAS INQUIRED INTO AND REPRESENTED AS THE GREATEST ENORMITY BY AN ADDRESS FROM THE COMMONS ALL OFFICERS OF THAT RELIGION WERE REMOVED FROM THE ARMY AND APPLICATION WAS MADE TO THE KING FOR SEIZING TWO THIRDS OF THE LANDS OF RECUSANTS
LEST HE SHOULD AFTERWARDS BE REPROACHED WITH BREACH OF HIS WORD WHEN HE SHOULD THINK PROPER AGAIN TO DECLARE THE ASSEMBLY AT WESTMINSTER NO PARLIAMENT
YET FOR THIS SLIGHT OFFENCE INSUFFICIENTLY PROVED HE WAS CONDEMNED TO PAY A FINE OF EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS
642
IT IS A HEARSAY OF A HEARSAY
HIS CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER PARTICULARS WAS FULL OF THE SAME RESERVE AND PRUDENCE
HAVING MARCHED TO THE RELIEF OF CHESTER WHICH WAS ANEW BESIEGED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES UNDER COLONEL JONES POINTZ ATTACKED HIS REAR AND FORCED HIM TO GIVE BATTLE
AND THE PEOPLE WERE RESOLVED TO BE MERRY WHEN THEY THEMSELVES PLEASED NOT WHEN THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD PRESCRIBE IT TO THEM
AND THE VIGOROUS CHASTISEMENT OF IT SUITING SO WELL THE UNDAUNTED CHARACTER OF CROMWELL WAS UNIVERSALLY APPROVED OF AT HOME AND ADMIRED AMONG FOREIGN NATIONS
THE KING UPON HIS RETURN FROM SCOTLAND WAS RECEIVED IN LONDON WITH THE SHOUTS AND ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE AND WITH EVERY DEMONSTRATION OF REGARD AND AFFECTION SIR RICHARD GOURNAY LORD MAYOR A MAN OF MODERATION AND AUTHORITY HAD PROMOTED THESE FAVORABLE DISPOSITIONS AND HAD ENGAGED THE POPULACE WHO SO LATELY INSULTED THE KING AND WHO SO SOON AFTER MADE FURIOUS WAR UPON HIM TO GIVE HIM THESE MARKS OF THEIR DUTIFUL ATTACHMENT
THEY VOTED A COMMISSION FOR SEQUESTRATIONS
THIS AGE AFFORDS GREAT MATERIALS FOR HISTORY
WHERE WE GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF ALL THE GRIEVANCES IMAGINARY IN THE CHURCH MORE REAL IN THE STATE OF WHICH THE NATION AT THAT TIME SO LOUDLY COMPLAINED THE HOUSE BEGAN WITH EXAMINING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SPEAKER THE LAST DAY OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENT
THE COMMITTEE MADE AN EXACT INQUIRY INTO ALL CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE KING'S ENTRY INTO THE HOUSE
THEIR MIND SET AFLOAT IN THE WIDE SEA OF INSPIRATION COULD CONFINE ITSELF WITHIN NO CERTAIN LIMITS
THIS TREE WAS AFTERWARDS DENOMINATED THE ROYAL OAK AND FOR MANY YEARS WAS REGARDED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH GREAT VENERATION
EVEN IN A FEAST WHICH THE CITY GAVE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL OF STATE IT WAS DEEMED A REQUISITE PRECAUTION IF WE MAY CREDIT WALKER AND DUGDALE TO SWEAR ALL THE COOKS THAT THEY WOULD SERVE NOTHING BUT WHOLESOME FOOD TO THEM
BECAUSE HE HAD NOT AS YET GIVEN HIS CONSENT TO THAT MODE OF WORSHIP SUCH RELIGIOUS ZEAL PREVAILED ON BOTH SIDES
IT WAS EXPECTED THAT FAIRFAX WHO STILL RETAINED THE NAME OF GENERAL WOULD CONTINUE TO ACT AGAINST SCOTLAND AND APPEAR AT THE HEAD OF THE FORCES
AND THEY REGARDED THE LEAST MOMENT OF RELAXATION IN THEIR INVASION OF ROYAL AUTHORITY AS HIGHLY IMPOLITIC DURING THE UNINTERRUPTED TORRENT OF THEIR SUCCESSES
FROM THE REPORTS OF THEIR COMMITTEES THE HOUSE DAILY PASSED VOTES WHICH MORTIFIED AND ASTONISHED THE COURT AND INFLAMED AND ANIMATED THE NATION
AND IF CHARLES WITHHELD THE ROYAL ASSENT HIS REFUSAL WAS IMPUTED TO THOSE PERNICIOUS COUNSELS WHICH HAD AT FIRST EXCITED THE POPISH REBELLION AND WHICH STILL THREATENED TOTAL DESTRUCTION TO THE PROTESTANT INTEREST THROUGHOUT ALL HIS DOMINIONS AND THOUGH NO FORCES WERE FOR A LONG TIME SENT OVER TO IRELAND AND VERY LITTLE MONEY REMITTED DURING THE EXTREME DISTRESS OF THAT KINGDOM SO STRONG WAS THE PEOPLE'S ATTACHMENT TO THE COMMONS THAT THE FAULT WAS NEVER IMPUTED TO THOSE PIOUS ZEALOTS WHOSE VOTES BREATHED NOTHING BUT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO THE IRISH REBELS
CROMWELL HIMSELF WAS DISSATISFIED THAT THE PARLIAMENT THOUGH THEY HAD DERIVED ALL THEIR AUTHORITY FROM HIM BEGAN TO PRETEND POWER FROM THE LORD AND TO INSIST ALREADY ON THEIR DIVINE COMMISSION
FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY ENTERED INTO AN ASSOCIATION TOOK AN OATH OF SECRECY AND KEPT A CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOME OF THE KING'S SERVANTS
THE PROTECTOR ENDEAVORED AT FIRST TO MAINTAIN THE APPEARANCE OF A LEGAL MAGISTRATE
AND HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF BY PUTTING BURNING COALS INTO THE BOOTS AND HOSE OF THE OFFICERS WHO ATTENDED HIM BEFORE THE KING'S TRIAL A MEETING WAS AGREED ON BETWEEN THE CHIEFS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE GENERAL OFFICERS IN ORDER TO CONCERT THE MODEL OF THAT FREE GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY WERE TO SUBSTITUTE IN THE ROOM OF THE MONARCHICAL CONSTITUTION NOW TOTALLY SUBVERTED
PROFOUND CAPACITY INDEED UNDAUNTED COURAGE EXTENSIVE ENTERPRISE
YET SUCH WERE THE CAPACITY GENIUS PRESENCE OF MIND DISPLAYED BY THIS MAGNANIMOUS STATESMAN THAT WHILE ARGUMENT AND REASON AND LAW HAD ANY PLACE HE OBTAINED AN UNDISPUTED VICTORY
THEY INSTANTLY REPLIED THAT THE DANGERS AND DISTEMPERS OF THE NATION WERE SUCH AS COULD ENDURE NO LONGER DELAY
AS THIS MEASURE WAS FORESEEN THE COMMONS TOOK CARE TO FINISH AND DISPERSE THEIR REMONSTRANCE WHICH THEY INTENDED AS A JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR CONDUCT TO THE PEOPLE
SOME ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TOWARDS FORCING A LOAN FROM THE CITIZENS
TO A BILL SO DESTRUCTIVE OF ROYAL AUTHORITY THEY PREFIXED WITH AN INSOLENCE SEEMINGLY WANTON A PREAMBLE EQUALLY DISHONORABLE TO THE PERSONAL CHARACTER OF THE KING
RUNNING ON IN A ROAD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS PRECIPICES AND CONCERTING NO PROPER MEASURES EITHER FOR SUBMITTING TO THE OBSTINACY OF THE COMMONS OR FOR SUBDUING IT RUSHWORTH VOL
A GREAT MAJORITY HE ALWAYS POSSESSED IN THE HOUSE OF PEERS EVEN AFTER THE BISHOPS WERE CONFINED OR CHASED AWAY
THE DANGERS OF WAR WERE DISREGARDED BY HIS VALOR
THE TWO RULING PASSIONS OF THIS PARLIAMENT WERE ZEAL FOR LIBERTY AND AN AVERSION TO THE CHURCH
AN ACCUSATION CARRIED ON BY THE UNITED EFFORT OF THREE KINGDOMS AGAINST ONE MAN UNPROTECTED BY POWER UNASSISTED BY COUNSEL DISCOUNTENANCED BY AUTHORITY WAS LIKELY TO PROVE A VERY UNEQUAL CONTEST
FAIRFAX HAVING NEITHER TALENTS HIMSELF FOR CABAL NOR PENETRATION TO DISCOVER THE CABALS OF OTHERS HAD GIVEN HIS ENTIRE CONFIDENCE TO CROMWELL
AND IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THEIR FURY HE THOUGHT PROPER SECRETLY TO WITHDRAW AND RETIRE INTO HOLLAND
THE KING WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME
THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY THE INTEREST OF ALL HIS HIGHNESS'S FRIENDS TO SEEK THE SHELTER OF THIS STATUTE
AND THAT IT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR PUBLIC SECURITY IF THE FANATICAL PARTY AND THE ROYALISTS WERE EXCLUDED
BUT THESE REBELLIONS OF THE FRENCH NEITHER ENNOBLED BY THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY NOR DISGRACED BY THE FANATICAL EXTRAVAGANCIES WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE BRITISH CIVIL WARS WERE CONDUCTED WITH LITTLE BLOODSHED AND MADE BUT A SMALL IMPRESSION ON THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE
AGREEABLY TO THE INACCURATE GENIUS OF THE OLD CONSTITUTION THIS ABUSE HOWEVER CONSIDERABLE HAD NEVER BEEN PERCEIVED NOR REMEDIED
THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO DECLARE IT ENTIRELY NULL AND INVALID BECAUSE FINISHED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
538
WITH THE PRETENDED SAINTS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS CROMWELL WAS FAMILIAR AND EASY
BUT SO LITTLE FAVORABLE WERE THE PEERS THAT THEY REFUSED HIM THIS ADVANTAGE OR INDULGENCE
WHEN THE PEERS MET ON THE DAY APPOINTED IN THEIR ADJOURNMENT THEY ENTERED UPON BUSINESS AND SENT DOWN SOME VOTES TO THE COMMONS OF WHICH THE LATTER DEIGNED NOT TO TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE
1-700-CARISBROOKE.JPG CARISBROKE CASTLE LORD CLARENDON IS POSITIVE THAT THE KING WHEN HE FLED FROM HAMPTON COURT HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING TO THIS ISLAND
INFORMATION OF THIS DESIGN WAS CONVEYED TO CROMWELL
AND THEY SPREAD THE TERROR OF THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THE WRITS FOR SHIP MONEY HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO THE SHERIFFS WHO WERE REQUIRED AND EVEN OBLIGED UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES TO ASSESS THE SUMS UPON INDIVIDUALS AND TO LEVY THEM BY THEIR AUTHORITY
NO SOONER HAD THEY REACHED THE PINNACLE OF GRANDEUR THAN THE INDEPENDENTS UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF STILL GREATER SANCTITY INSTIGATED THE ARMY AGAINST THEM AND REDUCED THEM TO SUBJECTION
SIR HENRY SLINGSBY AND DR HUET WERE CONDEMNED AND BEHEADED
THE ARTICLES WERE THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY
HIS FRIENDS BEHELD WITH COMPASSION AND PERHAPS EVEN HIS ENEMIES THAT GRAY AND DISCROWNED HEAD AS HE HIMSELF TERMS IT IN A COPY OF VERSES WHICH THE TRUTH OF THE SENTIMENT RATHER THAN ANY ELEGANCE OF EXPRESSION RENDERS VERY PATHETIC HAVING IN VAIN ENDEAVORED BY COURAGE TO DEFEND HIS THRONE FROM HIS ARMED ADVERSARIES IT NOW BEHOVED HIM BY REASONING AND PERSUASION TO SAVE SOME FRAGMENTS OF IT FROM THESE PEACEFUL AND NO LESS IMPLACABLE NEGOTIATORS
428
THE ESTATES OF THE ROYALISTS BEING AT THAT TIME ALMOST ENTIRELY UNDER SEQUESTRATION CHARLES WHO COULD GIVE THEM NO PROTECTION CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD PAY SUCH COMPOSITIONS AS THEY AND THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD AGREE ON
WANTONLY ATTACKED FRANCE THE OTHER GREAT KINGDOM IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND ENGAGED AT ONCE IN WAR AGAINST THESE TWO POWERS WHOSE INTERESTS WERE HITHERTO DEEMED SO INCOMPATIBLE THAT THEY COULD NEVER IT WAS THOUGHT AGREE EITHER IN THE SAME FRIENDSHIPS OR ENMITIES
WHAT I SAY
THE KING HAVING SHOWN AN INCLINATION TO SERVE ON BOARD THEIR FLEET THOUGH THEY EXPRESSED THEIR SENSE OF THE HONOR INTENDED THEM THEY DECLINED AN OFFER WHICH MIGHT INFLAME THE QUARREL WITH THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH
THE EXECUTIONER BROUGHT THAT BOOK WHICH HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN ELEGANT LATIN OF HIS GREAT MILITARY ACTIONS AND TIED IT WITH A CORD ABOUT HIS NECK
BUT HIS VIRTUES PREDOMINATED EXTREMELY ABOVE HIS VICES OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING HIS IMPERFECTIONS
AND THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF A LIMITED GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO REQUIRE IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES SOME MITIGATION OF SO RIGOROUS A DOCTRINE IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THE PRESIDING GENIUS OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION HAD RENDERED A MISTAKE IN THIS PARTICULAR VERY NATURAL AND EXCUSABLE
AND TO BE IMPRISONED DURING LIFE THIS SAME PRYNNE WAS A GREAT HERO AMONG THE PURITANS
BUT ON NO OCCASION WAS THE TRUTH OF THIS MAXIM MORE SENSIBLY FELT THAN IN THE PRESENT SITUATION OF ENGLAND
HE ASKED GOODWIN ONE OF HIS PREACHERS IF THE DOCTRINE WERE TRUE THAT THE ELECT COULD NEVER FALL OR SUFFER A FINAL REPROBATION
THE KING LEFT WORCESTER AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND WITHOUT HALTING TRAVELLED ABOUT TWENTY-SIX MILES IN COMPANY WITH FIFTY OR SIXTY OF HIS FRIENDS
HE REPLIED THAT HE COULD BY NO MEANS COMPLY WITH THE DESIRE OF THE OFFICERS
AND BY REFUSING THE PAYMENT OF ALL TAXES REDUCED THE ARMY TO THE GREATEST NECESSITIES
THE SAME MUTINOUS SPIRIT WHICH PREVAILED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD DIFFUSED ITSELF OVER THE NATION
A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE AND NOT MORE DISTINGUISHED BY HIS POETICAL GENIUS THAN BY HIS PARLIAMENTARY TALENTS AND BY THE POLITENESS AND ELEGANCE OF HIS MANNERS
ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RENDERED ABORTIVE BY ONE ACT OF FATAL TEMERITY TERRIFIED WITH THE PROSPECT OF RENEWING HIS PAINS AND FATIGUE HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO MAINTAIN THE FEW RESOURCES WHICH REMAINED TO A DESPERATE CAUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THE SAME REGARD TO HONOR WHICH HAD AT FIRST CALLED HIM TO ARMS NOW REQUIRED HIM TO ABANDON A PARTY WHERE HE MET WITH SUCH UNWORTHY TREATMENT
BLAKE TOOK SHELTER IN THE ENGLISH HARBORS
AND HAD BEEN ACQUITTED WITH NEW TRIUMPH AND EXULTATION
AND ASSISTED BY THE GENERAL FAVOR WHICH EVERY WHERE ATTENDED THE ROYAL CAUSE WERE ENABLED MOST OF THEM TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE
THE STREETS OF THE CITY WERE STROWED WITH DEAD
IT WAS THENCE THE COMMOTIONS FIRST AROSE
THE PRESENT IMPOSITIONS THOUGH MUCH SUPERIOR TO WHAT HAD EVER FORMERLY BEEN EXPERIENCED WERE IN REALITY MODERATE AND WHAT A NATION SO OPULENT COULD EASILY BEAR
AND THEY GLADLY SENT TO EDINBURGH COMMISSIONERS WITH AMPLE POWERS TO TREAT OF A NEARER UNION AND CONFEDERACY WITH THE SCOTTISH NATION
BUT IT SEEMS MORE PROBABLE THAT HE WAS OVERLOOKED AMIDST AFFAIRS OF GREATER CONSEQUENCE THAN THAT SUCH UNRELENTING HATRED WOULD BE SOFTENED BY ANY CONSIDERATION OF HIS COURAGE AND GENEROSITY
AND AS IT MIGHT BE ONE CAUSE OF THE GREAT PROGRESS WHICH HE HAD ALREADY MADE IT IS NOT AN UNLIKELY REASON WHICH MAY BE ASSIGNED FOR HIS REFUSING AT THIS TIME ANY FURTHER ELEVATION
THEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSED HIM ADMITTANCE AND ISSUED ORDERS FOR THE GUARDING THAT IS THE SEIZING OF HIS PERSON IN CASE HE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO VISIT THEM RUSH VOL
THE OTHER HE MARRIED TO THE VISCOUNT FAUCONBERG OF A FAMILY FORMERLY DEVOTED TO THE ROYAL PARTY
THE PEOPLE WHOM THE MODERATE TEMPER OR NARROW GENIUS OF THEIR PRINCES WOULD HAVE ALLOWED TO REMAIN FOREVER IN TRANQUILLITY WERE STRONGLY AGITATED BY THE EMULATION AND JEALOUSY OF THE MINISTERS
AND BY MEANS OF THIS MAN HE WAS LET INTO EVERY DESIGN AND CONSPIRACY OF THE PARTY
HE PROPOSED THEREFORE BY A MESSAGE THAT THEY WOULD AGREE UPON A LEGAL METHOD BY WHICH HE MIGHT CARRY ON HIS PROSECUTION AGAINST THE MEMBERS LEST FURTHER MISUNDERSTANDINGS HAPPEN WITH REGARD TO PRIVILEGE
MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY
THEY PROCEEDED THEREFORE WITH GREAT ZEAL IN FRAMING THE MODEL OF A PETITION WHICH SHOULD CONTAIN EXPRESSIONS MORE PRECISE AND MORE FAVORABLE TO PUBLIC FREEDOM
AND THE POWER OF ONE SIDE WAS NECESSARILY ATTENDED WITH DANGER TO THE OTHER
AND IT WAS REQUISITE TO TEMPER BY THE DECENCY AND MODERATION OF THEIR DEBATES THE RIGOR WHICH MUST NECESSARILY ATTEND THEIR DETERMINATIONS
THIS PRINCE DURING THE CIVIL WARS HAD MUCH NEGLECTED HIS UNCLE AND PAID COURT TO THE PARLIAMENT
DURING THAT SHORT INTERVAL WHICH PASSED BETWEEN CHARLES'S ACCESSION AND HIS FIRST PARLIAMENT HE HAD FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF HIS PREDECESSORS
THEIR GREAT ADVANTAGES IN THE NORTH SEEMED TO SECOND THEIR AMBITION AND FINALLY TO PROMISE THEM SUCCESS IN THEIR UNWARRANTABLE ENTERPRISES
BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WERE INTENT THAT ESSEX'S ARMY ON WHICH THEIR WHOLE FORTUNE DEPENDED SHOULD BE PUT IN A CONDITION OF MARCHING AGAINST THE KING
HE THEREFORE TREATED THEM WITH GREAT RIGOR AND DISDAIN AND USUALLY DENOMINATED THEM THE HEATHENS
AND THE SMALL REMAINS OF AUTHORITY WHICH STILL ADHERED TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE IN A MANNER WHOLLY EXTINGUISHED CLARENDON VOL T
AND WHEN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF SUBSCRIPTIONS WAS PROCURED THE PETITIONS WERE PRESENTED TO THE COMMONS AND IMMEDIATELY PUBLISHED
THAT ELEVEN YEARS INTERMISSION OF PARLIAMENTS--THE LONGEST THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE ENGLISH ANNALS--WAS A SUFFICIENT INDICATION OF THE JEALOUSY ENTERTAINED AGAINST THE PEOPLE
THE VIGOR OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE GREAT CAPACITY OF THOSE MEMBERS WHO HAD ASSUMED THE GOVERNMENT NEVER AT ANY TIME APPEARED SO CONSPICUOUS.[V WHITLOCKE P
AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE EMPEROR OF MOROCCO DESTROYED THAT RECEPTACLE OF PIRATES BY WHOM THE ENGLISH COMMERCE AND EVEN THE ENGLISH COASTS HAD LONG BEEN INFESTED
CONY WHO REFUSED TO PAY ILLEGAL TAXES WAS OBLIGED BY MENACES TO DEPART FROM HIS OBSTINACY
THE EARL OF HOLLAND WAS GENERAL OF THE HORSE
HERE WAS BROKEN OUT A REBELLION DREADFUL AND UNEXPECTED
WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THIS BAUBLE
CITIZENS AND COUNTRY GENTLEMEN SOON BECAME EXCELLENT OFFICERS
AND PEREMPTORILY REQUIRED HIS CONSENT OR REFUSAL
ONE OF THE SOLDIERS HAD A LANTERN IN HIS HAND AND A CANDLE BURNING IN IT AND IN THE OTHER HAND FOUR CANDLES NOT LIGHTED
HE JUSTIFIED HIS OWN INNOCENCE IN THE LATE FATAL WARS

BUT NEVER WAS SO MUCH MULTIPLIED AS AT PRESENT THE USE OF THESE COMMITTEES
431
WHAT ALONE GAVE THE KING SOME COMPENSATION FOR ALL THE ADVANTAGES POSSESSED BY HIS ADVERSARIES WAS THE NATURE AND QUALITIES OF HIS ADHERENTS
THE COMMISSIONERS RENDERED HIS CONFINEMENT AT HOLDENBY VERY RIGOROUS
WILDMAN AND SOME OTHERS OF THAT PARTY CARRIED STILL FURTHER THEIR CONSPIRACIES AGAINST THE PROTECTOR'S AUTHORITY
READING THE GARRISON OF THE KING'S WHICH LAY NEAREST TO LONDON WAS ESTEEMED A PLACE OF CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH IN THAT AGE WHEN THE ART OF ATTACKING TOWNS WAS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IN EUROPE AND WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN IN ENGLAND
THEN BE TAKEN DOWN HIS HEAD HE CUT OFF UPON A SCAFFOLD AND AFFIXED TO THE PRISON
THE KNEELING AT THE ALTAR AND THE USING OF COPES A SPECIES OF EMBROIDERED VESTMENT IN ADMINISTERING THE SACRAMENT WERE ALSO KNOWN TO BE GREAT OBJECTS OF SCANDAL AS BEING POPISH PRACTICES
THE AUTHORITY OF THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN DUBLIN AND THE OTHER TOWNS WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD DELIVERED INTO THEIR HANDS
BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE WHOLE NATION BECAME WARLIKE BY THE CONTINUANCE OF CIVIL DISCORDS THIS ADVANTAGE WAS MORE EQUALLY SHARED
166
166
166
TAKE THIS FOR YOUR FINAL ANSWER AND FORBEAR ANY FARTHER SOLICITATIONS
AND THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH HAVING NO PRETENCE TO INTERPOSE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THAT KINGDOM ALLOWED THE SCOTS FOR THE PRESENT TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEASURES IN SETTLING THEIR GOVERNMENT
659
THE COUNCIL OF STATE NOW CONFERRED ON HIM IN CONJUNCTION WITH MONK THE COMMAND OF THE FLEET
HE RETIRED TO DUNBAR
AT EVERY INTELLIGENCE OF DISORDERS IN THE ARMY HE WAS MOVED TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF GRIEF AND OF ANGER
77
THEY RENEWED THE GENERAL'S COMMISSION AND ENLARGED HIS POWERS
BUT NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THEM
THIS RESOLUTION IF YIELDED TO WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE PUT AN END TO THE DOMINION OF THE PARLIAMENT
OF ASSASSINATIONS LIKEWISE HE WAS APPREHENSIVE FROM THE ZEALOUS SPIRIT WHICH ACTUATED THE SOLDIERS
ONE SOLDIER TOO SEIZED BY CONTAGIOUS SYMPATHY DEMANDED FROM HEAVEN A BLESSING ON OPPRESSED AND FALLEN MAJESTY
CHARLES KNEW THAT THE FORCE OF THE COVENANTERS WAS CONSIDERABLE THEIR SPIRITS HIGH THEIR ZEAL FURIOUS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOTHING COULD BE MORE NECESSARY THAN SUCH A STATUTE FOR COMPLETING A REGULAR PLAN OF LAW AND LIBERTY
IN COMPARISON OF THE ELOQUENT SPEAKERS AND FINE GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE HE WAS ENTIRELY OVERLOOKED
YET FEW BATTLES HAVE BEEN DISPUTED WITH MORE FIERCE AND OBSTINATE COURAGE THAN WERE THOSE MANY NAVAL COMBATS WHICH WERE FOUGHT DURING THIS SHORT BUT VIOLENT WAR
THE OFFICERS HAD ORDERS TO BE READY ON THE FIRST SUMMONS
THE TWELVE JUDGES WERE AT FIRST APPOINTED IN THE NUMBER
P.[**INSERTED 256 262 263 ETC
BUT FOR THIS EFFORT OF HIS ZEAL HE WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS REMOVED FROM HIS OFFICE CONDEMNED TO MAKE A PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND BE BOUND TO HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR NOT ONLY SUCH OF THE CLERGY AS NEGLECTED TO OBSERVE EVERY CEREMONY WERE SUSPENDED AND DEPRIVED BY THE HIGH COMMISSION COURT
THE OLD TREATY HAD LONG BEEN DISAVOWED BY THE KING AND SUPPOSED BY ALL PARTIES TO BE ANNULLED FOOTNOTE 17
AND THE SAME VARIATIONS IN WHICH AN ENTHUSIAST INDULGED HIMSELF HE WAS APT BY A NATURAL TRAIN OF THINKING TO PERMIT IN OTHERS
WHEN HE APPROACHED WITH HIS ATTENDANTS NEAR TO THE COMMUNION TABLE HE BOWED FREQUENTLY TOWARDS IT
BUT AS ALL KINGS OF ENGLAND HAD EVER IN CASES OF NECESSITY OR EXPEDIENCY BEEN ACCUSTOMED AT INTERVALS TO ELUDE THEM
FOR WE ARE BORN FREE
THE LORD HAS NOT ONLY OWNED US IN OUR WORK THERE BUT IN OUR WAITING UPON HIM IN A WAY OF PRAYER WHICH IS INDEED OUR OLD EXPERIENCED APPROVED WAY IN ALL STREIGHTS AND DIFFICULTIES CROMWELL'S LETTER TO BLAKE AND MONTAGUE HIS BRAVE ADMIRALS IS REMARKABLE FOR THE SAME SPIRIT
IT TENDED ONLY TO ENHANCE THE GENERAL EXULTATION FOR THOSE SCENES OF HAPPINESS AND TRANQUILLITY WHICH ALL MEN NOW CONFIDENTLY PROMISED THEMSELVES
HIS OWN BREAST HE IMAGINED WAS FULL OF THE SAME INSPIRATION WHICH HAD GUIDED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES THEMSELVES
AND WHEN THE POPULACE BY LAND AND BY WATER PASSED WHITEHALL THEY STILL ASKED WITH INSULTING SHOUTS WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE KING AND HIS CAVALIERS
AND SHE PREVAILED WITH THE KING TO PASS THESE BILLS IN HOPES OF APPEASING FOR A TIME THE RAGE OF THE MULTITUDE THESE NEW CONCESSIONS HOWEVER IMPORTANT THE KING IMMEDIATELY FOUND TO HAVE NO OTHER EFFECT THAN HAD ALL THE PRECEDING ONES
HE POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE ARTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GAIN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ARMY
HE REFUSED TO RESTORE THE PALATINE TO HIS PRINCIPALITY EXCEPT ON CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM IN TOTAL DEPENDENCE AND THUS THE NEGOTIATION WAS PROTRACTED TILL THE BATTLE OF LUTZEN WHERE THE SWEDISH MONARCH PERISHED IN THE MIDST OF A COMPLETE VICTORY WHICH HE OBTAINED OVER HIS ENEMIES
MOST OF THEM WITH PATIENCE SUBMITTED TO CONFINEMENT OR APPLIED BY PETITION TO THE KING WHO COMMONLY RELEASED THEM
AND FINDING WE WERE NOT LIKE TO HAVE GOOD TERMS FROM THE KING WE FROM THAT TIME VOWED HIS DESTRUCTION THIS RELATION SUITING WELL ENOUGH WITH OTHER PASSAGES AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THIS TIME I HAVE INSERTED TO GRATIFY THE READER'S CURIOSITY CARTE'S ORMOND VOL
THE URGENCY OF THE OCCASION AND THE LITTLE TIME ALLOWED FOR DEBATE WERE REASONS WHICH HE RESERVED AGAINST THE MALECONTENTS IN THE HOUSE
AND THEY VOTED THAT ALL COMMISSIONS SHOULD BE RECEIVED FROM THE SPEAKER AND BE SIGNED BY HIM IN THE NAME OF THE HOUSE
THEY IMPOSED TAXES THE HEAVIEST AND OF THE MOST UNUSUAL NATURE BY AN ORDINANCE OF THE TWO HOUSES
LANE FORMED A SCHEME FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRISTOL WHERE IT WAS HOPED HE WOULD FIND A SHIP IN WHICH HE MIGHT TRANSPORT HIMSELF
BUT NOTHING WAS ATTENDED WITH MORE UNIVERSAL SCANDAL THAN THE PROPENSITY OF MANY IN THE PARLIAMENT TOWARDS A TOLERATION OF THE PROTESTANT SECTARIES
IN HIS ABSENCE HE TOOK CARE TO HAVE HIS NAME PROPOSED TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE
AFTER A SHARP COMBAT BY HIS UNDAUNTED COURAGE WHICH IN HIS SITUATION WAS TRUE POLICY AND WAS ALSO NOT UNACCOMPANIED WITH MILITARY SKILL HE PUT THE ENEMY TO FLIGHT AND IN THE PURSUIT DID GREAT EXECUTION UPON THEM 1ST OF SEPTEMBER 1644
ONE OF THE POPULACE MORE INSOLENT THAN THE REST DREW NIGH TO HIS COACH AND CALLED OUT WITH A LOUD VOICE TO YOUR TENTS O ISRAEL THE WORDS EMPLOYED BY THE MUTINOUS ISRAELITES WHEN THEY ABANDONED REHOBOAM THEIR RASH AND ILL-COUNSELLED SOVEREIGN WHEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS MET THEY AFFECTED THE GREATEST DISMAY
WHEREIN HE ALLOWED ALL FREEDOM AND WOULD HIMSELF SUM UP THE ARGUMENTS AND GIVE A MOST CLEAR JUDGMENT UPON THEM
AND ON EVERY GREAT EVENT THE WHOLE SCRIPTURE WAS RANSACKED BY THE CLERGY FOR PASSAGES APPLICABLE TO THE PRESENT OCCASION
AND AFTER LONG AND SOLEMN PREPARATIONS WAS BROUGHT TO A FINAL ISSUE
OKEY AXTEL COBBET CREDE AND OTHER OFFICERS OF THAT PARTY WERE TAKEN PRISONERS WITH HIM
THAT THE LOSS OF ALL ARREARS AND THE CASHIERING OF EVERY OFFICER AND SOLDIER WERE THE LIGHTEST PUNISHMENT WHICH MUST BE EXPECTED
SO THAT AS FLEETWOOD SAID THURLOE VOL
BUT AS IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BE INDUCED TO PAY TAXES LEVIED BY ARBITRARY WILL AND PLEASURE IT WAS AGREED TO PRESERVE THE SHADOW OF CIVIL ADMINISTRATION AND TO REVIVE THE LONG PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD BEEN EXPELLED BY CROMWELL

HE DEPARTED THE HALL WITHOUT RECEIVING THE APPLAUSE WHICH HE EXPECTED
YE MAY HAVE SKILL IN YOUR PROFESSION
THE PROGRESS OF HIS ARMS EVEN IF ATTENDED WITH SUCCESS MUST THERE BE SLOW AND GRADUAL
FROM CROMWELL'S SUGGESTION A REMONSTRANCE WAS DRAWN BY THE COUNCIL OF GENERAL OFFICERS AND SENT TO THE PARLIAMENT
A PENSION OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR WAS SETTLED ON ESSEX
WHEN JAMES DESERTED THE SPANISH ALLIANCE AND COURTED THAT OF FRANCE HE HAD PROMISED TO FURNISH LEWIS WHO WAS ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF NAVAL FORCE WITH ONE SHIP OF WAR TOGETHER WITH SEVEN ARMED VESSELS HIRED FROM THE MERCHANTS
TO THE TWENTY-THIRD YEAR OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA

HE DESERVES THE EPITHET OF A GOOD RATHER THAN OF A GREAT MAN
AND IN THE MAIN THE SCOTS WERE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEVER BEFORE WHILE THEY ENJOYED THEIR IRREGULAR FACTIOUS LIBERTY HAD THEY ATTAINED SO MUCH HAPPINESS AS AT PRESENT WHEN REDUCED TO SUBJECTION UNDER A FOREIGN NATION
HE PASSED THROUGH MANY OTHER ADVENTURES
THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS EXCITED BY NEW ATTEMPTS STILL MORE PRECIPITATE AND IMPRUDENT
THE FORCES IN THE NORTH UNDER POINTZ HAD ALREADY MUTINIED AGAINST THEIR GENERAL AND HAD ENTERED INTO AN ASSOCIATION WITH THAT BODY OF THE ARMY WHICH WAS SO SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED IN EXALTING THE MILITARY ABOVE THE CIVIL AUTHORITY THAT NO RESOURCE MIGHT REMAIN TO THE PARLIAMENT IT WAS DEMANDED THAT THE MILITIA OF LONDON SHOULD BE CHANGED THE PRESBYTERIAN COMMISSIONERS DISPLACED AND THE COMMAND RESTORED TO THOSE WHO DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR HAD CONSTANTLY EXERCISED IT
376 ENDEAVORS WERE USED BEFORE CHARLES'S DEPARTURE TO HAVE A PROTECTOR OF THE KINGDOM APPOINTED WITH A POWER TO PASS LAWS WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO THE KING
THE PROTECTOR WAS APPOINTED SUPREME MAGISTRATE OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND AS THE INTENTION OF THIS SUPPLY WAS TO INDEMNIFY THE MEMBERS WHO BY THEIR PRIVATE HAD SUPPORTED PUBLIC CREDIT THIS PRETENCE WAS IMMEDIATELY LAID HOLD OF AND THE MONEY WAS ORDERED TO BE PAID NOT INTO THE TREASURY BUT TO COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY PARLIAMENT
ALL THE INHABITANTS OF EACH PARISH WERE ORDERED TO MEET AND CHOOSE ELDERS ON WHOM TOGETHER WITH THE MINISTER WAS BESTOWED THE ENTIRE DIRECTION OF ALL SPIRITUAL CONCERNS WITHIN THE CONGREGATION
GUTHRY'S MEMOIRS P
GUTHRY'S MEMOIRS P
HE HAD NO PROVISIONS BUT WHAT HE RECEIVED BY SEA
THE SEVERE REPENTANCE WHICH HE HAD UNDERGONE FOR ABANDONING STRAFFORD HAD NO DOUBT CONFIRMED HIM IN THE RESOLUTION NEVER AGAIN TO BE GUILTY OF A LIKE ERROR
HE ALSO FORESAW THAT FURTHER CONCESSIONS WITH REGARD TO RELIGION MIGHT PROBABLY BE DEMANDED BY THE BIGOTED IRISH
THE LICENSE WHICH THE PARLIAMENT HAD BESTOWED ON THIS SPIRIT BY CHECKING ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY
SUCH MAXIMS THOUGH THEY SEEM REASONABLE ARE PERHAPS TOO PERFECT FOR HUMAN NATURE
EXAMPLES AND PRECEDENTS UNIFORM AND ANCIENT CAN SURELY FIX THE NATURE OF ANY CONSTITUTION AND THE LIMITS OF ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT
IN ORDER TO RAISE THIS IMPOSITION WHICH COMMONLY PASSED BY THE NAME OF DECIMATION THE PROTECTOR INSTITUTED TWELVE MAJOR-GENERALS
OUT THEY WOULD LIE COZEN AND DECEIVE
360
360

WHEN CHARLES OPENED THIS SESSION HE HAD FORESEEN THAT THE SAME CONTROVERSY WOULD ARISE
AT THIS ERA IT MAY BE PROPER TO STOP A MOMENT AND TAKE A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE AGE SO FAR AS REGARDS MANNERS FINANCES ARMS COMMERCE ARTS AND SCIENCES
ALL THE STEPS TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT OF EPISCOPACY HAD INDEED BEEN TAKEN WITH CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
AND HE SENT TO PARIS A DEPUTATION INVITING THE LORD LIEUTENANT TO RETURN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS GOVERNMENT
THE PEOPLE REMAINED IN THAT SILENCE AND ASTONISHMENT WHICH ALL GREAT PASSIONS WHEN THEY HAVE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXERTING THEMSELVES NATURALLY PRODUCE IN THE HUMAN MIND
ONE CONSISTED OF NOBILITY ANOTHER OF GENTRY A THIRD OF MINISTERS A FOURTH OF BURGESSES
I SHALL FURTHER ADD THAT EVEN IF THE PARLIAMENT HAD DISCOVERED THE DECEIT IN BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE THIS OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ALTERED THEIR POLITICAL MEASURES OR MADE THEM REFUSE SUPPLY TO THE KING
BESIDES A SENSE OF HIS OWN INTEREST AND A REGARD TO ROYAL POWER WHICH HAS BEEN ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED IN THIS COUNTRY HIS VERY PASSION FOR PRELACY AND FOR RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES MUST LEAD HIM TO INVADE A CHURCH WHICH HE HAS EVER BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD AS ANTI-CHRISTIAN AND UNLAWFUL
TO SUPPLY THE WANT OF PARLIAMENTARY AIDS CHARLES ISSUED PRIVY SEALS FOR BORROWING MONEY FROM HIS SUBJECTS THE ADVANTAGE REAPED BY THIS EXPEDIENT WAS A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR THE DISGUST WHICH IT OCCASIONED
AND THE VICTORY SEEMED LONG UNDECIDED BETWEEN THEM
SO FAR INDEED HE ADOPTED THIS PLAN THAT HE AGREED NOT ONLY TO CONFIRM HIS FORMER CONCESSIONS OF ABROGATING THE CANONS THE LITURGY THE HIGH COMMISSION AND THE ARTICLES OF PERTH BUT ALSO TO ABOLISH THE ORDER ITSELF OF BISHOPS FOR WHICH HE HAD SO ZEALOUSLY CONTENDED BUT THIS CONCESSION WAS GAINED BY THE UTMOST VIOLENCE WHICH HE COULD IMPOSE ON HIS DISPOSITION AND PREJUDICES
THESE HAD SCARCELY IN ANY INSTANCE REFUSED BAIL UPON COMMITMENTS BY SPECIAL COMMAND OF THE KING BECAUSE THE PERSONS COMMITTED HAD SELDOM OR NEVER DARED TO DEMAND IT AT LEAST TO INSIST ON THEIR DEMAND
THE MONEY WAS ENTIRELY EXPENDED ON THE NAVY TO THE GREAT HONOR AND ADVANTAGE OF THE KINGDOM
AND HAVING MADE A BREACH GAVE A GENERAL ASSAULT
SHE WAS A PERSON OF NOBLE EXTRACTION DAUGHTER OF HORACE LORD VERE OF TILBURY
AND THEY EVEN MADE APOLOGIES FULL OF SORROW AND CONTRITION FOR THEIR LATE VICTORY RUSH
VOLUME ONE
WERE THE ALTERNATIVE QUITE NECESSARY IT WERE SURELY MUCH BETTER FOR HUMAN SOCIETY TO BE DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY THAN TO BE DESTITUTE OF GOVERNMENT
AND NONE REMAINED BUT THE HELPLESS KING AND PARLIAMENT TO OPPOSE THEIR VIOLENT MEASURES
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE GENERAL ODIUM ATTENDING THAT CRIME NOTWITHSTANDING THE CLEAR AND FULL PROOF OF HIS GUILT SO LITTLE CONVICTION PREVAILED OF THE PROTECTOR'S RIGHT TO THE SUPREME GOVERNMENT IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY THAT THIS CONSPIRATOR WAS CONDEMNED
TWELVE BISHOPS WERE UNJUSTLY THROWN INTO THE TOWER BY THE COMMONS
WHERE THEY MIGHT ENJOY LECTURES AND DISCOURSES OF ANY LENGTH OR FORM WHICH PLEASED THEM
LORD SAY MASTER OF THE WARDS IN THE ROOM OF THE SAME NOBLEMAN
THERE WERE TOO MANY MEN OF HONOR IN THAT COMPANY TO AVOW A PALPABLE CHEAT
HE DIED IN 1679 AGED NINETY-ONE
AN INCONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THE ENEMY PUT THE WHOLE ARMY TO ROUT KILLED SIX HUNDRED OF THEM AND CHASED THE REST ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS
WHOEVER WAS KNOWN TO BE DISAFFECTED OR EVEN LAY UNDER ANY SUSPICION THOUGH NO GUILT COULD BE PROVED AGAINST HIM WAS EXPOSED TO THE NEW EXACTION
THE EARL OF DERBY LORD HERBERT OF CHERBURY MR LEE COLONEL MORGAN ENTERED INTO THIS ENTERPRISE

THE BISHOP HIMSELF AND MANY OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL BEING PRESENT
AND THE WHOLE KINGDOM WAS ATTENTIVE TO THE ISSUE OF A CAUSE WHICH WAS OF MUCH GREATER CONSEQUENCE THAN THE EVENT OF MANY BATTLES
COLONEL HEWSON FROM HIS PIOUS ZEAL MARCHED WITH HIS REGIMENT INTO LONDON AND DESTROYED ALL THE BEARS WHICH WERE KEPT THERE FOR THE DIVERSION OF THE CITIZENS
AND AS FOR THOSE WHO MAINTAINED THEIR DUTY TO THE KING MERELY FROM THEIR REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTION THEY SEEMED BY THEIR CONCURRENCE TO SWELL THAT INUNDATION WHICH BEGAN ALREADY TO DELUGE EVERY THING
ON THE CONTRARY IF WE CONSIDER THE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES TO WHICH HE WAS SO FREQUENTLY REDUCED AND COMPARE THE SINCERITY OF HIS PROFESSIONS AND DECLARATIONS WE SHALL AVOW THAT PROBITY AND HONOR OUGHT JUSTLY TO BE NUMBERED AMONG HIS MOST SHINING QUALITIES
ALL CONNECTIONS WERE DISSOLVED AND DEATH WAS DEALT BY THAT HAND FROM WHICH PROTECTION WAS IMPLORED AND EXPECTED
THE SAME AUTHOR P
THE KING RECEIVED AN ACCOUNT OF THIS INSURRECTION BY A MESSENGER DESPATCHED FROM THE NORTH OF IRELAND
THE WORST OF IT IS THAT THERE WAS A GREAT TANG OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE CONDUCT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS WHICH THOUGH IT MIGHT RENDER THEIR CONDUCT SINCERE WILL NOT MUCH ENHANCE THEIR CHARACTER WITH POSTERITY
THE ENTHUSIASTS THEMSELVES SEEMED TO BE DISARMED OF THEIR FURY
BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
AT EVERY BONFIRE RUMPS WERE ROASTED
HE PROMISED INDULGENCE TO TENDER CONSCIENCES WITH REGARD TO THE CEREMONIES OF THE CHURCH

THEY AGREED TO PRESENT A REMONSTRANCE TO THE KING IN WHICH THEY RECAPITULATED ALL NATIONAL GRIEVANCES AND MISFORTUNES AND OMITTED NO CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH COULD RENDER THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION DESPICABLE AND ODIOUS
SOME MEMBERS FAVORABLE TO THE COURT HAVING INSISTED ON AN ADDITION OF TWO FIFTEENTHS TO THE FORMER SUPPLY EVEN THIS PITTANCE WAS REFUSED THOUGH IT WAS KNOWN THAT A FLEET AND ARMY WERE LYING AT PORTSMOUTH IN GREAT WANT OF PAY AND PROVISIONS
LEARNED BEYOND WHAT IS COMMON IN PRINCES HE WAS A GOOD JUDGE OF WRITING IN OTHERS AND ENJOYED HIMSELF NO MEAN TALENT IN COMPOSITION
THROUGHOUT THE THREE KINGDOMS THERE PREVAILED NOTHING BUT THE MELANCHOLY FEARS TO THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF A BLOODY MASSACRE AND EXTERMINATION
HE WAS PREPARING HE SAID TO PARTICIPATE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER WHICH HE RESOLVED TO TAKE NEXT SABBATH
FACTION AND DISCONTENT LIKE DISEASES FREQUENTLY ARISE IN EVERY POLITICAL BODY
AND HAVING ENTERED INTO A SECRET CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY GENERALS WAS MORE INTENT ON SCHEMES FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL SAFETY THAN ANXIOUS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HIS COUNTRY OR RELIGION
THEY AGREED TO ADVANCE WITHOUT FIRING TILL THEY SHOULD REACH THE TOP OF THE HILL AND COULD BE ON EQUAL GROUND WITH THE ENEMY
THOUGH THEY EXPECTED THAT THE EXECUTION OF THE LAWS AGAINST PAPISTS WOULD FOR THE FUTURE BE NO MORE EXACT AND RIGID THAN THEY HAD HITHERTO FOUND IT
THE KING CONCLUDED NOT THIS ALLIANCE WITHOUT COMMUNICATING HIS INTENTIONS TO THE PARLIAMENT WHO RECEIVED THE PROPOSAL WITH SATISFACTION THIS WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF ORANGE
BUT THE MISFORTUNES WHICH THE DUTCH MET WITH IN BATTLE WERE SMALL IN COMPARISON OF THOSE WHICH THEIR TRADE SUSTAINED FROM THE ENGLISH
THE FURIOUS ZEAL FOR LIBERTY AND PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE WHICH HAD HITHERTO RUN UNCONTROLLED THROUGHOUT THE NATION NOW AT LAST EXCITED AN EQUAL ARDOR FOR MONARCHY AND EPISCOPACY WHEN THE INTENTION OF ABOLISHING THESE ANCIENT MODES OF GOVERNMENT WAS OPENLY AVOWED BY THE PARLIAMENT
THESE TROOPS SO LONG AS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN WERE USEFUL BY DIVERTING THE FORCE OF THE IRISH REBELS AND PROTECTING IN THE NORTH THE SMALL REMNANTS OF THE BRITISH PLANTERS
BUT WITH REGARD TO IRELAND THEY AT ONCE ASSUMED IT FULLY AND ENTIRELY AS IF DELIVERED OVER TO THEM BY A REGULAR GIFT OR ASSIGNMENT
AND THAT AS HE HAD FAILED ON HIS PART THEY WERE FREED FROM ALL OBLIGATIONS TO ALLEGIANCE AND MUST SETTLE THE NATION WITHOUT CONSULTING ANY LONGER SO MISGUIDED A PRINCE CLARENDON VOL
BECAUSE ON THAT SIDE IT WAS FOUND MOST NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF THE KING AND OF HIS MINISTERS
ONE OF THEM DESERTED HIM
BUT FEARING THAT SO EXTRAORDINARY A PROJECT WOULD NOT BE RELISHED HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH DROPPING SOME HINTS OF IT AND OPENLY WENT NO FURTHER THAN TO PROPOSE A STRICT DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND THE UNITED PROVINCES SUCH AS HAS NOW FOR NEAR SEVENTY YEARS TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THESE FRIENDLY POWERS BUT THE STATES WHO WERE UNWILLING TO FORM A NEARER CONFEDERACY WITH A GOVERNMENT WHOSE MEASURES WERE SO OBNOXIOUS AND WHOSE SITUATION SEEMED SO PRECARIOUS OFFERED ONLY TO RENEW THE FORMER ALLIANCES WITH ENGLAND
THE COMMONS APPLIED FOR CANCELLING THE COMMISSION AND WERE NO DOUBT DESIROUS THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD CONCLUDE THE KING'S PRINCIPLES TO BE EXTREMELY ARBITRARY AND SHOULD OBSERVE WHAT LITTLE REGARD HE WAS DISPOSED TO PAY TO THE LIBERTIES AND PRIVILEGES OF HIS PEOPLE
SIR JOHN REPLIED THAT TO THE WORLD THEY SEEMED TO BE SUCH AS WOULD NOT SWEAR WHORE OR BE DRUNK
AND OF THAT PARTY DUKE HAMILTON WAS THE LEADER
AND THEN ATTACKED THEM WITH GREAT BRAVERY KILLED SEVERAL AND CHASED THE REST FROM THEIR GROUND
THE CAUSES OF THAT EVENT MAY ADMIT OF A MORE EASY EXPLICATION
AND THE REALITY OF THE SUPPOSITION THOUGH FOR THE FUTURE IT OUGHT EVER TO BE LITTLE LOOKED FOR MUST BY ALL CANDID INQUIRERS BE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE PAST
HE HAD ALSO THE HAPPINESS OF ESTABLISHING AT ONCE HIS THEORY ON THE MOST SOLID AND CONVINCING PROOFS
BUT THAT PRINCE REJECTED SUCH PUSILLANIMOUS COUNSEL
AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THESE HUMORS BROKE FORTH INTO ACTION
THE OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN CASHIERED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND WHO HAD RESUMED THEIR COMMANDS THAT THEY MIGHT SUBDUE THAT ASSEMBLY WERE AGAIN CASHIERED AND CONFINED TO THEIR HOUSES
SUCH EQUABILITY OF TEMPER DID HE POSSESS THAT DURING ALL THE VARIETY OF FORTUNE WHICH HE UNDERWENT NO DIFFERENCE WAS PERCEIVED IN HIS COUNTENANCE OR BEHAVIOR
635
BUT THIS AUTHOR MAKES IT SUFFICIENTLY APPEAR THAT THIS PROVISION SMALL AS IT IS WAS NEVER REGULARLY PAID THE EJECTED CLERGY
NO SOONER HAD THE KING REFUSED HIS ASSENT TO THE FOUR BILLS THAN HAMMOND BY ORDERS FROM THE ARMY REMOVED ALL HIS SERVANTS CUT OFF HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIS FRIENDS AND SHUT HIM UP IN CLOSE CONFINEMENT
AND THE ARMY BEING PROVIDED WITH SO PLAUSIBLE A PRETENCE WHICH IN ALL PUBLIC TRANSACTIONS IS OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE ADVANCED TO CHASTISE THE REBELLIOUS CITY AND TO REINSTATE THE VIOLATED PARLIAMENT NEITHER LENTHAL NOR MANCHESTER WERE ESTEEMED INDEPENDENTS
THESE OBSERVATIONS ALONE MAY BE ESTABLISHED ON BOTH SIDES THAT THE APPEARANCES WERE SUFFICIENTLY STRONG IN FAVOR OF THE KING TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS FOLLOWING SUCH MAXIMS
AND HE ORDERED ONE TO BE DRAWN UP FOR THAT PURPOSE
AND HIS VALOR DURING THE WAR HAD SHONE OUT WITH A LUSTRE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY WHICH HE HAD EVER BEEN DISTINGUISHED
BUT BESIDES THAT THIS MEASURE WAS FULL OF EXTREME HAZARD WHAT WAS IT BUT INSTANTLY TO COMBINE WITH THEIR OLD ENEMIES AGAINST THEIR OLD FRIENDS
AN ADDRESS AGAINST EPISCOPACY WAS PRESENTED BY TWELVE CLERGYMEN TO THE COMMITTEE OF RELIGION AND PRETENDED TO BE SIGNED BY MANY HUNDREDS OF THE PURITANICAL PERSUASION
AND THE COURT INDUSTRIOUSLY SPREAD THEM OVER THE KINGDOM
NOR IS THERE ANY SPIRIT SO ERECT AND INDEPENDENT AS NOT TO BE BROKEN BY THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF THE SILENT AND INGLORIOUS SUFFERINGS OF A JAIL
BESIDES THE GENERAL COMMITTEES OF RELIGION TRADE PRIVILEGES LAWS MANY SUBDIVISIONS OF THESE WERE FRAMED AND A STRICT SCRUTINY WAS EVERY WHERE CARRIED ON
IMPEACHMENTS WHICH WERE NEVER PROSECUTED WERE CARRIED UP AGAINST SIR RICHARD BOLTON THE CHANCELLOR SIR GERARD LOUTHER CHIEF JUSTICE AND BRAMHALL BISHOP OF DERRY THIS STEP WHICH WAS AN EXACT COUNTERPART TO THE PROCEEDINGS IN ENGLAND SERVED ALSO THE SAME PURPOSES
THE SOLICITOR IN THE NAME OF THE COMMONS REPRESENTED THAT CHARLES STUART BEING ADMITTED KING OF ENGLAND AND INTRUSTED WITH A LIMITED POWER YET NEVERTHELESS FROM A WICKED DESIGN TO ERECT AN UNLIMITED AND TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT HAD TRAITOROUSLY AND MALICIOUSLY LEVIED WAR AGAINST THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHOM THEY REPRESENTED AND WAS THEREFORE IMPEACHED AS A TYRANT TRAITOR MURDERER AND A PUBLIC AND IMPLACABLE ENEMY TO THE COMMONWEALTH
THAT IF THEY ON THEIR PART LAID ASIDE ALL ENORMOUS CLAIMS AND PRETENSIONS AND PROVIDED IN A REASONABLE MANNER FOR THE PUBLIC NECESSITIES THEY NEEDED ENTERTAIN NO SUSPICION OF ANY INSATIABLE AMBITION OR ILLEGAL USURPATION IN THE CROWN
NOTE D P
THE PROTECTOR WAS JUSTLY ALARMED AT THOSE MOVEMENTS AMONG THE OFFICERS
THE GREAT COURAGE AND CONDUCT DISPLAYED BY MANY OF THE POPULAR LEADERS HAVE COMMONLY INCLINED MEN TO DO THEM IN ONE RESPECT MORE HONOR THAN THEY DESERVE AND TO SUPPOSE THAT LIKE ABLE POLITICIANS THEY EMPLOYED PRETENCES WHICH THEY SECRETLY DESPISED IN ORDER TO SERVE THEIR SELFISH PURPOSES
ENCOURAGED BY THESE FAVORABLE APPEARANCES PETITIONS AGAINST THE CHURCH WERE FRAMED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KINGDOM

V SEE JOHN WALKER'S ATTEMPT TOWARDS RECOVERING AN ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBERS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE CLERGY
THE ROYALISTS OBSERVING THIS GENERAL ILL WILL TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT COULD NO LONGER BE RETAINED IN SUBJECTION
THEY TREATED CHARLES WITH SUCH AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE THAT HE THOUGHT IT MORE DECENT TO WITHDRAW AND PREVENT THE INDIGNITY OF BEING DESIRED TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM
SO HIGH WAS HIS CHARACTER FOR MILDNESS AND HUMANITY THAT HE STILL PRESERVED BY MEANS OF THESE POPULAR VIRTUES THE PUBLIC FAVOR
AND HE CONSUMED IN GAMING DRINKING DEBAUCHERY AND COUNTRY RIOTS THE MORE EARLY YEARS OF HIS YOUTH AND DISSIPATED PART OF HIS PATRIMONY

THE ROYALISTS WERE PUT TO FLIGHT
AND HAVING COMMUNICATED TO THEM HIS RESOLUTION OF MARCHING INTO ENGLAND HE RECEIVED A SEASONABLE THOUGH NO GREAT SUPPLY OF MONEY
ALL HIS SERVANTS CONSULTING THEIR OWN SAFETY RATHER THAN THEIR MASTER'S HONOR DECLINED INTERPOSING WITH THEIR ADVICE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PARLIAMENT
THE PROCEEDINGS THEREFORE OF THIS FAMOUS COMMITTEE WHICH CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL YEARS WERE CRUEL AND ARBITRARY AND MADE GREAT HAVOC BOTH ON THE CHURCH AND THE UNIVERSITIES
THE HORROR AND ANTIPATHY OF THESE FANATICS HAD FOR MANY YEARS BEEN ARTFULLY FOMENTED AGAINST CHARLES
WHAT FURTHER SECURITY CAN BE DESIRED OR EXPECTED
THAT APPLICATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
ALL THESE VIEWS ENFORCED BY THE VIOLENT SPIRIT OF ST JOHN WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER CROM-WELL DETERMINED THE PARLIAMENT TO CHANGE THE PURPOSED ALLIANCE INTO A FURIOUS WAR AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES
BY THE CONCESSIONS WHICH THE KING HAD GRANTED TO SCOTLAND IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO SUMMON A PARLIAMENT ONCE IN THREE YEARS
BUT AT ALFORD HE MET HIMSELF WITH A LIKE FATE
THESE POLITICS WERE NOW EMBRACED BY CHARLES
NOT TO MENTION MEN'S FAVORABLE DISPOSITION TOWARDS THE CAUSE
THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY LEARN WHAT IT WAS BUT WE MIGHT DISCOVER IT IF WE COULD BUT INTERCEPT A LETTER SENT FROM THE KING TO THE QUEEN WHEREIN HE INFORMED HER OF HIS RESOLUTION
OTHER PARTS ARE TOO PERFECT FOR HUMAN NATURE AND SAVOR STRONGLY OF THAT FANATICAL SPIRIT SO PREVALENT THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
BUT THE NATION WAS REDUCED TO DESPAIR WHEN IT SAW NEITHER END PUT TO THEIR DURATION NOR BOUNDS TO THEIR AUTHORITY

THEY VOTED THE SEIZING OF THE KING'S PERSON TO BE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND SENT A MESSAGE TO THE GENERAL TO KNOW BY WHAT AUTHORITY THAT ENTERPRISE HAD BEEN EXECUTED
SKIPPON WHOM THE PARLIAMENT HAD APPOINTED BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY MAJOR-GENERAL OF THE CITY MILITIA CONDUCTED THE MEMBERS AT THE HEAD OF THIS TUMULTUARY ARMY TO WESTMINSTER HALL
THE COMMONS PRETENDED NOT AS THEY AFFIRMED TO ANY UNUSUAL POWERS OR PRIVILEGES
IN THE EASTERN ASSOCIATION THEY LEVIED FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER THE EARL OF MANCHESTER SECONDED BY CROMWELL AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER ESSEX
IT IS AFFIRMED BY CLARENDON THAT SO LITTLE BENEFIT WAS REAPED FROM THESE PROJECTS THAT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS THEREBY LEVIED ON THE PEOPLE SCARCELY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CAME INTO THE KING'S COFFERS

ALL THE PEPPER WAS BOUGHT FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY UPON TRUST AND SOLD AT A GREAT DISCOUNT FOR READY MONEY.[V A SCHEME WAS PROPOSED FOR COINING TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS OF BASE MONEY:[V SUCH WERE THE EXTREMITIES TO WHICH CHARLES WAS REDUCED
HE HAD LEVIED AN ARMY OF NINE THOUSAND MEN WITH WHICH HE HAD MENACED ALL THEIR WESTERN COAST
THE KING WAS SOFTENED AT THIS MOVING SCENE AND EXPRESSED HIS GRATITUDE FOR THEIR DUTIFUL AFFECTION
LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS SUGGESTED LIKE COUNSELS
AND THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO PUT HIMSELF IN HIS HANDS AND TO ATTEND HIM TO CARISBROKE CASTLE IN THE ISLE OF WIGHT WHERE THOUGH RECEIVED WITH GREAT DEMONSTRATIONS OF RESPECT AND DUTY HE WAS IN REALITY A PRISONER
AND HE RECEIVED THEM WITH THE SAME GRACE AND CHEERFULNESS AS IF THEY HAD TRAVELLED ON NO OTHER ERRAND THAN TO PAY COURT TO HIM
CHARLES NOW FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO DEPART FROM THAT DELICACY WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY MAINTAINED
IN THIS COVENANT THE SUBSCRIBERS BESIDES ENGAGING MUTUALLY TO DEFEND EACH OTHER AGAINST ALL OPPONENTS BOUND THEMSELVES TO ENDEAVOR WITHOUT RESPECT OF PERSONS THE EXTIRPATION OF POPERY AND PRELACY SUPERSTITION HERESY SCHISM AND PROFANENESS
THE KING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT INTOXICATED WITH GOOD FORTUNE NOR ASPIRED TO A TOTAL VICTORY OVER THE PARLIAMENT PUBLISHED A MANIFESTO IN WHICH HE RENEWED THE PROTESTATION FORMERLY TAKEN WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY AND EXPRESSED HIS FIRM INTENTION OF MAKING PEACE UPON THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION
THE EARL OF MANCHESTER WITH CROMWELL TO WHOM THE FAME OF THIS GREAT VICTORY WAS CHIEFLY ASCRIBED AND WHO WAS WOUNDED IN THE ACTION RETURNED TO THE EASTERN ASSOCIATION IN ORDER TO RECRUIT HIS ARMY.[V CLARENDON VOL
AND THE KING HOPED THAT IN THEIR PRESENT DISPOSITION THE PLIGHT OF THEIR NATIVE PRINCE FLYING TO THEM IN THIS EXTREMITY OF DISTRESS WOULD ROUSE EVERY-SPARK OF GENEROSITY IN THEIR BOSOM AND PROCURE HIM THEIR FAVOR AND PROTECTION
PUT THEM TO FLIGHT IN SPITE OF ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT

YOU HAVE SAYS HE AS I VERILY BELIEVE AND AM PERSUADED A PLENTIFUL STOCK OF PRAYERS GOING FOR YOU DAILY SENT UP BY THE SOBEREST AND MOST APPROVED MINISTERS AND CHRISTIANS IN THIS NATION
NO REMEDY COULD THEN BE LOOKED FOR BUT FROM INSURRECTIONS AND CIVIL WAR OF WHICH THE ISSUE WOULD BE EXTREMELY UNCERTAIN AND WHICH MUST IN ALL EVENTS PROVE CALAMITOUS TO THE NATION
THE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES OF THAT MEASURE RETARDED ITS IMPROVEMENT
IN ORDER TO MAKE A NEW TRIAL FOR A TREATY THE KING THIS SPRING SENT ANOTHER LETTER DIRECTED TO THE LORDS AND COMMONS OF PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED AT WESTMINSTER
AND THAT A REPUBLIC TOGETHER WITH A PROTECTOR HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FURTHER SECURITIES FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND THESE EXCEEDED NOT THE NUMBER OF FIFTY OR SIXTY
TO WHICH IN THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF GOVERNMENT HE CONFESSED HIMSELF NOWISE ENTITLED
THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE
HE WILL ACCOUNT IT PRESUMPTION FOR ANYONE TO PRESCRIBE TO HIM ANY TIME FOR THE CALLING OF THAT ASSEMBLY FRANKLYN P
TO-DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
WILLIAMS HAD BEEN INDEBTED FOR ALL HIS FORTUNE TO THE FAVOR OF JAMES
248 1279
BY A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE PREROGATIVE WHICH THE CROWN HAD EVER ASSUMED OF OBLIGING MEN TO ACCEPT OF ANY BRANCH OF PUBLIC SERVICE WAS ABOLISHED AND ANNIHILATED
IT IS HOWEVER PROBABLE IF NOT CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE GENERALLY SPEAKING THE DUPES OF THEIR OWN ZEAL
FORESEEING THAT A GENERAL SUBMISSION TO THE LORD LIEUTENANT WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS OWN INFLUENCE HE CONSPIRED WITH OWEN O'NEAL WHO COMMANDED THE NATIVE IRISH IN ULSTER AND WHO BORE A GREAT JEALOUSY TO PRESTON THE GENERAL CHIEFLY TRUSTED BY THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY
ON THE OTHER HAND PRINCE RUPERT WHOSE BOILING ARDOR STILL PUSHED HIM ON TO BATTLE EXCITED THE IMPATIENT HUMOR OF THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY OF WHICH THE ARMY WAS FULL
THIS MILITIA WAS NOW CALLED OUT AND ORDERED TO GUARD THE LINES WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN ROUND THE CITY IN ORDER TO SECURE IT AGAINST THE KING
NOR WAS IT THEN CONCEIVED THAT THE KING DID NOT POSSESS OF HIMSELF SUFFICIENT POWER FOR THE SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF HIS PEOPLE OR THAT THE AUTHORITY OF THESE POPULAR ASSEMBLIES WAS EVER TO BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT THE PRINCE MUST ALWAYS CONFORM HIMSELF TO IT AND COULD NEVER HAVE ANY OCCASION TO GUARD AGAINST THEIR PRACTICES AS WELL AS AGAINST THOSE OF HIS OTHER SUBJECTS
BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
HE WAS POSSESSED OF AN EXCELLENT TASTE IN ALL THE FINE ARTS
YET NOTWITHSTANDING THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MIGHT PROMPT THEM TO EMBRACE VIOLENT RESOLUTIONS THEY ENTERED UPON BUSINESS WITH PERFECT TEMPER AND DECORUM
DR BIRCH IN P
HE WAS TOO HONEST A MAN TO FALSIFY THE FORMER
THIS WAS THE FAMED GUSTAVUS WHOSE HEROIC GENIUS SECONDED BY THE WISEST POLICY MADE HIM IN A LITTLE TIME THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MONARCH OF THE AGE AND RENDERED HIS COUNTRY FORMERLY UNKNOWN AND NEGLECTED OF GREAT WEIGHT IN THE BALANCE OF EUROPE
BUT THE KING'S SEVERITY IF THESE PROSECUTIONS DESERVE THE NAME HERE POINTED OUT LEADERS TO THEM WHOSE RESENTMENT WAS INFLAMED AND WHOSE COURAGE WAS NOWISE DAUNTED BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH THEY HAD UNDERGONE IN SO HONORABLE A CAUSE
BESIDES THE CERTAIN AND INCONCEIVABLE MISCHIEFS OF CIVIL WAR ARE NOT THE PERILS APPARENT WHICH THE DELICATE FRAME OF LIBERTY MUST INEVITABLY SUSTAIN AMIDST THE FURIOUS SHOCK OF ARMS
THE KING'S AUTHORITY WAS AT THAT TIME REDUCED TO THE LOWEST EBB
AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY OBLIGED TO SOFTEN AND EVEN RETRACT THE EXPRESSION

THE GOODS OF ROLLES A MERCHANT AND MEMBER OF THE HOUSE BEING SEIZED FOR HIS REFUSAL TO PAY THE DUTIES COMPLAINTS WERE MADE OF THIS VIOLENCE AS IF IT WERE A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE:[V CHARLES SUPPORTED HIS OFFICERS IN ALL THESE MEASURES
HE ADDRESSED THEREFORE HIS DISCOURSE TO THE FEW PERSONS WHO WERE ABOUT HIM
CONSPIRACIES FOR AN ASSASSINATION HE WAS CHIEFLY AFRAID OF
BUT CHARLES WAS NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY TAMED TO COMPLIANCE
THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED SO MUCH UNSUPPORTED BY REVENUE AND BY MILITARY POWER MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS
AND THEY DEEMED IT LESS IGNOMINIOUS TO SUBMIT TO A PERSON OF SUCH ADMIRABLE TALENTS AND CAPACITY THAN TO A FEW IGNOBLE ENTHUSIASTIC HYPOCRITES WHO UNDER THE NAME OF A REPUBLIC HAD REDUCED THEM TO A CRUEL SUBJECTION
P 871
653
THE PAST SCENE DISPLAYS IN A FULL LIGHT THE BARBARITY OF THIS THEOLOGICAL FACTION
BY OPPOSING THESE PRACTICES WE SHALL BUT TREAD IN THE STEPS OF OUR FOREFATHERS WHO STILL PREFERRED THE PUBLIC BEFORE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST NAY BEFORE THEIR VERY LIVES
A BREWER'S WIFE FOLLOWED BY MANY THOUSANDS OF HER SEX BROUGHT A PETITION TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH THE PETITIONERS EXPRESSED THEIR TERROR OF THE PAPISTS AND PRELATES AND THEIR DREAD OF LIKE MASSACRES RAPES AND OUTRAGES WITH THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN COMMITTED UPON THEIR SEX IN IRELAND
AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS
1653 OLIVER CROMWELL IN WHOSE HANDS THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PARLIAMENT HAD LEFT THE WHOLE POWER CIVIL AND MILITARY OF THREE KINGDOMS WAS BORN AT HUNTINGDON THE LAST YEAR OF THE FORMER CENTURY OF A GOOD FAMILY
THE SECRET INTRUSION OF MALIGNANTS INTO THE KING'S FAMILY AND EVEN INTO THE CAMP
NOWISE SUPERIOR TO THE MILITIA WHO WERE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS AND WHO WERE IN A GREAT MEASURE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN
THE TWO HOUSES IMMEDIATELY CHOSE NEW SPEAKERS LORD HUNSDON AND HENRY PELHAM
AND THE LIVES AND FORTUNES OF THE WHOLE NATION NO LONGER PROTECTED BY JUSTICE ARE SUBJECTED TO ARBITRARY WILL AND PLEASURE
AFTER A FEW DAYS A MORE JUST ACCOUNT ARRIVED
IT IS HOWEVER CERTAIN THAT THIS POWER THOUGH ESSENTIAL TO PARLIAMENTS MAY EASILY BE ABUSED AS WELL BY THE FREQUENCY AND MINUTENESS OF THEIR REMONSTRANCES AS BY THEIR INTRUSION INTO EVERY PART OF THE KING'S COUNSELS AND DETERMINATIONS
BUT WHAT MOST PLEASED THE ROYALISTS WAS THE EXPECTATION THAT SOME DISASTER HAD HAPPENED TO HAMBDEN THEIR CAPITAL AND MUCH DREADED ENEMY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE RECOGNITION OF HIS AUTHORITY BY THE LAST PARLIAMENT THE PROTECTOR COULD NOT AS YET TRUST TO AN UNBIASED JURY
FOR THIS OFFENCE HE WAS SUMMONED BEFORE THE MARSHAL'S COURT
ON THE PRINCE'S SIDE THE ASSAULT WAS CONDUCTED WITH EQUAL COURAGE AND ALMOST WITH EQUAL LOSS BUT WITH BETTER SUCCESS
AND THE REESTABLISHING ON ITS ANCIENT BASIS THE WHOLE FRAME OF GOVERNMENT CIVIL AS WELL AS ECCLESIASTICAL
THE EARL OF STAMFORD FOLLOWED HIM AT SOME DISTANCE WITH A CONSIDERABLE SUPPLY
AS IF THE SAME MEN HAD BEEN EVERY WHERE ELECTED AND NO TIME HAD INTERVENED SINCE THEIR MEETING
THIS SUPPLY HAD VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED THE KING'S EXPECTATIONS
THE SOLDIER AFTERWARDS BOASTING THAT HE HAD WON THIS TROPHY WAS REPROVED BY DOYLEY WHO HAD SEEN THE ACTION
IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SUCH IRREGULARITIES HAD PREVAILED IN CONSTITUTING THESE ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS AND SUCH VIOLENCE IN CONDUCTING THEM THAT THERE WERE SOME GROUNDS FOR DENYING THE AUTHORITY OF ALL THEIR ACTS
ALL HIS CONCESSIONS WERE POISONED BY THEIR SUSPICION OF HIS WANT OF CORDIALITY
AND ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE FESTIVAL THE SLAVES SEVERALLY RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER SERVITUDES
767
IF THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KING WERE AT ONCE TRANSFERRED TO HIM THE QUESTION WAS PLAINLY ABOUT A NAME AND THE PREFERENCE WAS INDISPUTABLY DUE TO THE ANCIENT TITLE
MANWARING HAD PREACHED A SERMON WHICH THE COMMONS FOUND UPON INQUIRY TO BE PRINTED BY SPECIAL COMMAND OF THE KING AND WHEN THIS SERMON WAS LOOKED INTO IT CONTAINED DOCTRINES SUBVERSIVE OF ALL CIVIL LIBERTY
AND IT ASSURED THE SOLDIERS OF ALL THEIR ARREARS AND PROMISED THEM FOR THE FUTURE THE SAME PAY WHICH THEY THEN ENJOYED
BUT FAIRFAX HAVING APPOINTED A RENDEZVOUS OF THE ARMY WROTE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND DESIRED LEAVE TO RETAIN FOR SOME DAYS LIEUTENANT GENERAL CROMWELL WHOSE ADVICE HE SAID WOULD BE USEFUL IN SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAD RESIGNED
IN THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS IT WAS PRESENTLY VOTED TO FRAME A REMONSTRANCE TO THE PARLIAMENT
IF UNREASONABLE IN THEIR REFUSAL THEY STILL REFUSED NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS THEIR OWN
AND IF THEY AROSE FROM ILL CONDUCT HE AT LEAST WAS ENTIRELY INNOCENT
LAUD ALSO WAS IMMEDIATELY UPON THIS GENERAL CHARGE SEQUESTERED FROM PARLIAMENT AND COMMITTED TO CUSTODY THE CAPITAL ARTICLE INSISTED ON AGAINST THESE TWO GREAT MEN WAS THE DESIGN WHICH THE COMMONS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN FORMED OF SUBVERTING THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND AND INTRODUCING ARBITRARY AND UNLIMITED AUTHORITY INTO THE KINGDOM
THE PARLIAMENT WAS NEVER MENTIONED NOR THOUGHT OF
NINETY MEMBERS HOWEVER OF THE LOWER HOUSE HAD THE COURAGE TO DISSENT FROM THIS VOTE
EVEN THEIR SOUTHERN NEIGHBORS THEY THOUGHT THOUGH SEPARATED FROM ROME STILL RETAINED A GREAT TINCTURE OF THE PRIMITIVE POLLUTION
THE RIGID PRESBYTERIANS WHO HATED THE KING EVEN MORE THAN THEY ABHORRED TOLERATION
1-623-HAMPDEN.JPG SIR EDMOND HAMBDEN THIS QUESTION WAS BROUGHT TO A SOLEMN TRIAL BEFORE THE KING'S BENCH
IT WAS GORING WHO BETRAYED THE SECRET TO THE POPULAR LEADERS
THE ESTATES AND REVENUE OF THIS SINGLE TROOP ACCORDING TO LORD CLARENDON'S COMPUTATION WERE AT LEAST EQUAL-TO THOSE OF ALL THE MEMBERS WHO AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF WAR VOTED IN BOTH HOUSES
THOUGH WITHOUT ANY PLAN FOR RESISTING MILITARY USURPATIONS THEY RESOLVED TO WITHSTAND THEM TO THE UTTERMOST
BUT AS HE LOOKED LIKE AN HONEST MAN WE WOULD ONLY SEARCH HIS SADDLE AND SO DISMISS HIM
13 WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND AFTER SEVERAL DELAYS THEY WERE RELEASED
ANDERSON VOL
AND WHEREAS BY REASON OF MANY DISCOVERIES WE CANNOT BUT FEAR THEY WILL PROCEED NOT ONLY TO STIR UP THE LIKE REBELLIONS AND INSURRECTIONS IN THIS KINGDOM OF ENGLAND BUT ALSO TO BACK THEM WITH FORCES FROM ABROAD ETC HERE CHARLES FIRST VENTURED TO PUT A STOP TO HIS CONCESSIONS AND THAT NOT BY A REFUSAL BUT A DELAY
ON THE OTHER HAND THE PARLIAMENT HAVING SUPPLIED SIR WILLIAM WALLER IN WHOM THEY MUCH TRUSTED WITH A COMPLETE ARMY DESPATCHED HIM WESTWARDS IN ORDER TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE ROYALISTS
FERDINAND III 1658 LEWIS XIII
SO OBVIOUS INDEED WAS THE KING'S PRESENT INABILITY TO INVADE THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE FEARS AND JEALOUSIES WHICH OPERATED ON THE PEOPLE AND PUSHED THEM SO FURIOUSLY TO ARMS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE
TO HAVE CHANGED THEM FOR THE MODERN MAXIMS OF TOLERATION HOW REASONABLE SOEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED A VERY BOLD AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE
ORDERS WERE ISSUED BY THEM AND EVERY WHERE OBEYED WITH THE UTMOST REGULARITY AND AMONG THE FIRST ACTS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT WAS THE PRODUCTION OF THE COVENANT THIS FAMOUS COVENANT CONSISTED FIRST OF A RENUNCIATION OF POPERY FORMERLY SIGNED BY JAMES IN HIS YOUTH AND COMPOSED OF MANY INVECTIVES FITTED TO INFLAME THE MINDS OF MEN AGAINST THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES WHOM HEAVEN HAS ENJOINED THEM TO CHERISH AND TO LOVE
ALMOST ALL THE BENCH OF BISHOPS AND THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OF THE INFERIOR CLERGY WHO HAD VOTED IN THE LATE CONVOCATION FOUND THEMSELVES EXPOSED BY THESE NEW PRINCIPLES TO THE IMPUTATION OF DELINQUENCY THE MOST UNPOPULAR OF ALL CHARLES'S MEASURES AND THE LEAST JUSTIFIABLE WAS THE REVIVAL OF MONOPOLIES SO SOLEMNLY ABOLISHED AFTER REITERATED ENDEAVORS BY A RECENT ACT OF PARLIAMENT
ITS PAY AMOUNTED TO A YEARLY SUM OF ONE MILLION FORTY-SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POUNDS AFTERWARDS THE PROTECTOR REDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT TO THIRTY THOUSAND MEN
THE KING OFFERED TO RETRENCH EVERY THING WHICH HE DID NOT ESTEEM OF APOSTOLICAT INSTITUTION
OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES
BEFORE HE WAS PERMITTED TO LAND HE WAS REQUIRED TO SIGN THE COVENANT
WE MAKE NO SCRUPLE OF TRUSTING THE PARLIAMENT SAID THEY WERE WE CERTAIN THAT THE PARLIAMENT WERE TO CONTINUE TILL OUR REPAYMENT
THE CHIEF ACQUISITION WHICH THEY OWE TO THE ENTERPRISING SPIRIT OF CROMWELL
THAT THIS LETTER WAS SOWN UP IN THE SKIRT OF A SADDLE AND THE BEARER OF IT WOULD COME WITH THE SADDLE UPON HIS HEAD ABOUT TEN OF THE CLOCK THAT NIGHT TO THE BLUE BOAR IN HOLBORN WHERE HE WAS TO TAKE HORSE FOR DOVER
SOMETIMES WHIPPED SOMETIMES PILLORIED
CHARLES FOUND HIMSELF DISAPPOINTED IN HIS EXPECTATIONS OF INCREASING HIS ARMY
AND EVERY OTHER CRIME BESIDES SUCH AS ARE THERE EXPRESSLY MENTIONED IS CAREFULLY EXCLUDED FROM THAT APPELLATION
AND IS NOT THE COURT FULL OF PAPISTS PRELATES MALIGNANTS
HE THERE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE PARLIAMENT DESIRING THEM TO REMOVE FROM LONDON THOSE REGIMENTS WHICH THOUGH THEY NOW PROFESSED TO RETURN TO THEIR DUTY HAD SO LATELY OFFERED VIOLENCE TO THAT ASSEMBLY
FOR OUR SUBJECTS HAVE LEARNED I DARE SAY THAT VICTORIES OVER THEIR PRINCES ARE BUT TRIUMPHS OVER THEMSELVES AND SO WILL MORE UNWILLINGLY HEARKEN TO CHANGES HEREAFTER
NO SOONER HAD THEY SUBDUED THEIR SOVEREIGN THAN THEIR OWN SERVANTS ROSE AGAINST THEM AND TUMBLED THEM FROM THEIR SLIPPERY THRONE
HIS FRIENDS THE MOST CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM AND HIS COUNSELLORS THE MOST TRUSTED WERE ENTERING INTO CABALS AGAINST HIS AUTHORITY
AND DIVERS OTHER CHARGES HAVE BEEN LAID AND LEVIED UPON YOUR PEOPLE IN SEVERAL COUNTIES BY LORD LIEUTENANTS DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS COMMISSIONERS FOR MUSTERS JUSTICES OF PEACE AND OTHERS BY COMMAND OR DIRECTION FROM YOUR MAJESTY OR YOUR PRIVY COUNCIL AGAINST THE LAWS AND FREE CUSTOMS OF THIS REALM
AN ADVANTAGE WHICH ALL THE SKILL AND BRAVERY OF THE DUTCH ADMIRALS COULD NOT COMPENSATE
THE TROOPS THEMSELVES WERE FORMED INTO A KIND OF REPUBLIC
BUT RESERVED TO HIMSELF IF HE PLEASED THE POWER OF CONCEALING THE CONSPIRATORS
304
THE INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT CROMWELL HAD FORMERLY EXTOLLED AS THE MOST PERFECT WORK OF HUMAN INVENTION
EVEN THE HUMBLE PETITION AND ADVICE WHICH HE EXTOLLED IN ITS TURN APPEARED SO LAME AND IMPERFECT THAT IT WAS FOUND REQUISITE THIS VERY SESSION TO MEND IT BY A SUPPLEMENT
TO SHOW THE GREATER ALIENATION FROM THE CHURCHES REFORMED AFTER THE PRESBYTERIAN MODEL LAUD ADVISED THAT THE DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON THE ENGLISH REGIMENTS AND TRADING COMPANIES ABROAD ALL FOREIGNERS OF THE DUTCH AND WALLOON CONGREGATIONS WERE COMMANDED TO ATTEND THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH
THE COMMONS NEXT RESUMED THEIR CENSURE OF BUCKINGHAM'S CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR AGAINST WHOM THEY WERE IMPLACABLE
FAIRFAX HAVING REACHED SALISBURY IN HIS ROAD WESTWARD RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THE COMMITTEE OF BOTH KINGDOMS APPOINTED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WAR TO RETURN AND LAY SIEGE TO OXFORD NOW EXPOSED BY THE KING'S ABSENCE
BUT UPON INVITATION AND ASSURANCES RETURNED IN A FEW DAYS
HE TOOK CARE NEVER TO NAME ANY OF THE OLD GENUINE CAVALIERS WHO HAD ZEALOUSLY ADHERED AND WERE RESOLVED STILL TO ADHERE TO THE ROYAL CAUSE IN EVERY FORTUNE
THIS DESERTION OF THE ENGLISH PUT AN END TO ORMOND'S AUTHORITY WHICH WAS ALREADY MUCH DIMINISHED BY THE MISFORTUNES AT DUBLIN TREDAH AND WEXFORD
PEN AND VENABLES RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND WERE BOTH OF THEM SENT TO THE TOWER BY THE PROTECTOR WHO THOUGH COMMONLY MASTER OF HIS FIERY TEMPER WAS THROWN INTO A VIOLENT PASSION AT THIS DISAPPOINTMENT
8TH OF SEPT 1644
THE ONLY BUSINESS OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS TO GIVE SUPPLY WHICH WAS SO MUCH WANTED BY THE KING IN ORDER TO CARRY ON THE WAR IN WHICH THEY HAD ENGAGED HIM
AND WORDS MAY BE VERY LIKE IN SOUND AND DIFFER MUCH IN SENSE
AND AMIDST THE HIGHEST EXULTATIONS OF JOY WERE INTERMINGLED LOUD AND VIRULENT INVECTIVES AGAINST THE PRELATES WHO HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED SUCH GODLY PERSONAGES THE MORE IGNOBLE THESE MEN WERE THE MORE SENSIBLE WAS THE INSULT UPON ROYAL AUTHORITY AND THE MORE DANGEROUS WAS THE SPIRIT OF DISAFFECTION AND MUTINY WHICH IT DISCOVERED AMONG THE PEOPLE
THE PRESBYTERIANS WERE PLEASED TO SEE THOSE MEN BY WHOM THEY HAD BEEN OUTWITTED AND EXPELLED NOW IN THEIR TURN EXPELLED AND OUTWITTED BY THEIR OWN SERVANT
BUT IN THE GREAT VARIETY OF HUMAN GENIUSES THERE ARE SOME WHICH THOUGH THEY SEE THEIR OBJECT CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY IN GENERAL YET WHEN THEY COME TO UNFOLD ITS PARTS BY DISCOURSE OR WRITING LOSE THAT LUMINOUS CONCEPTION WHICH THEY HAD BEFORE ATTAINED
THE QUEEN THE PRINCE WROTE PATHETIC LETTERS TO THE PARLIAMENT
AND THE MORE THEY WERE EXAMINED THE MORE EVIDENTLY DID IT APPEAR TO MANY THAT LIBERTY WAS TOTALLY SUBVERTED AND AN UNUSUAL AND ARBITRARY AUTHORITY EXERCISED OVER THE KINGDOM
THE AUTHOR IS SENSIBLE THAT SOME BLAME MAY BE THROWN UPON HIM ON ACCOUNT OF THIS LAST CLAUSE IN MR HAMBDEN'S CHARACTER
THIS LAST MAXIM IS LAUDABLE AND CONTINUES STILL TO BE RELIGIOUSLY OBSERVED BY THE SECT
THE PARLIAMENT AVOWED AND JUSTIFIED THE ACTION MAY BOOK II
THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY OR DISAGREEABLE COMPLAINTS OF GRIEVANCES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PLAGUE WHICH BEGAN TO APPEAR AT OXFORD AND ON THAT PRETENCE IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED THEM
THEY VOTED THAT AN ARMY SHOULD BE LEVIED UNDER SIR WILLIAM WALLER WHOM NOTWITHSTANDING HIS MISFORTUNES THEY LOADED WITH EXTRAORDINARY CARESSES
IN MANY RENCOUNTERS THE ENGLISH UNDER LORD MORE SIR WILLIAM ST LEGER SIR FREDERIC HAMILTON AND OTHERS HAD THOUGH UNDER GREAT DISADVANTAGES OF SITUATION AND NUMBERS PUT THE IRISH TO ROUT AND RETURNED IN TRIUMPH TO DUBLIN
BUT PROVIDENCE DOES SO DISPOSE
THIS IS A CAPITAL FACT AND OUGHT TO BE WELL ATTENDED TO
AND HAVING NOW IN THE EYE OF THE LAW BEEN GUILTY OF TREASON BY LEVYING WAR AGAINST THEIR SOVEREIGN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEIR FEARS AND JEALOUSIES MUST ON THAT ACCOUNT HAVE MULTIPLIED EXTREMELY AND HAVE RENDERED THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY WHICH THEY INTERWOVE WITH THE SAFETY OF THE NATION STILL MORE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE MONARCH
AND HAD BROUGHT RELIEF TO ALL THE FORTS WHICH WERE BESIEGED OR BLOCKADED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE KINGDOM A THOUSAND ACRES IN ULSTER WERE GIVEN TO EVERY ONE THAT SUBSCRIBED TWO HUNDRED POUNDS IN CONNAUGHT TO THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN MUNSTER FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN LEINSTER FOR SIX HUNDRED
UPON ONE OF THE MOST MATERIAL POINTS THEY PRESSED HIS MAJESTY WITH THEIR REASONS AND BEST ARGUMENTS THEY COULD USE TO GRANT WHAT THEY DESIRED
WHY TROUBLE OURSELVES WITH DISPUTES ABOUT A CONSTITUTION FRANCHISES PROPERTY OF GOODS AND THE LIKE
THOUGH TWICE REPULSED WITH LOSS HE RENEWED THE ATTACK AND HIMSELF ALONG WITH IRETON LED ON HIS MEN

THESE TROOPS COULD NOT LEGALLY WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT BE CARRIED OUT OF THE COUNTY
A PETITION ADDRESSED TO FAIRFAX THE GENERAL WAS HANDED ABOUT CRAVING AN INDEMNITY AND THAT RATIFIED BY THE KING FOR ANY ILLEGAL ACTIONS OF WHICH DURING THE COURSE OF THE WAR THE SOLDIERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN GUILTY
462
462

MEANWHILE THE SPLENDOR OF THE NOBILITY WITH WHICH THE KING WAS ENVIRONED MUCH ECLIPSED THE APPEARANCE AT WESTMINSTER
HAVING ENCLOSED THE ROYALISTS AT TRURO HE FORCED THE WHOLE ARMY CONSISTING OF FIVE THOUSAND MEN CHIEFLY CAVALRY TO SURRENDER UPON TERMS
AMONG THE OTHER SPOILS WAS SEIZED THE KING'S CABINET WITH THE COPIES OF HIS LETTERS TO THE QUEEN WHICH THE PARLIAMENT AFTERWARDS ORDERED TO BE PUBLISHED THEY CHOSE NO DOUBT SUCH OF THEM AS THEY THOUGHT WOULD REFLECT DISHONOR ON HIM

HIS BROTHER PRINCE MAURICE WAS THERE SHIPWRECKED IN A HURRICANE
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS APPREHENSION CHARLES OFFERED THAT THE ARMS OF THE STATE SHOULD BE INTRUSTED DURING THREE YEARS TO TWENTY COMMISSIONERS WHO SHOULD BE NAMED EITHER BY COMMON AGREEMENT BETWEEN HIM AND THE PARLIAMENT OR ONE HALF BY HIM THE OTHER BY THE PARLIAMENT
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE OPPOSITION OF THE AMBASSADOR WHO PLEADED THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS OFFICE DON PANTALEON WAS EXECUTED ON TOWER HILL
AND THEY SEIZED WHEREVER THEY HAD POWER THE REVENUES OF ALL THE KING'S PARTY AND KNOWING THAT THEMSELVES AND ALL THEIR ADHERENTS WERE BY RESISTING THE PRINCE EXPOSED TO THE PENALTIES OF LAW THEY RESOLVED BY A SEVERE ADMINISTRATION TO OVERCOME THOSE TERRORS AND TO RETAIN THE PEOPLE IN OBEDIENCE BY PENALTIES OF A MORE IMMEDIATE EXECUTION
CHARLES THOUGHT THAT WHAT CONCESSIONS WERE MADE TO THE PUBLIC WERE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IF NO GRATIFICATIONS WERE BESTOWED ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD ACQUIRED THE DIRECTION OF PUBLIC COUNSELS AND DETERMINATIONS
HE DIED IN 1687 AGED EIGHTY-TWO
AND HE RESOLVED TO RETURN IF POSSIBLE WITHOUT RUNNING THAT HAZARD
AFTER MENTIONING PROJECTORS AND ILL MINISTERS OF STATE THESE SAID HE HAVE INTRODUCED A PRIVY COUNCIL RAVISHING AT ONCE THE SPHERES OF ALL ANCIENT GOVERNMENT
THE POWER OF THE SWORD WAS VESTED IN THE PROTECTOR JOINTLY WITH THE PARLIAMENT WHILE IT WAS SITTING OR WITH THE COUNCIL OF STATE IN THE INTERVALS
THE PARLIAMENT WHO INSTEAD OF THEIR FOND EXPECTATIONS THAT CHARLES WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COLLECT AN ARMY HAD NOW THE PROSPECT OF A CIVIL WAR BLOODY AND OF UNCERTAIN EVENT
HE WAS OF A ROBUST FRAME OF BODY AND OF A MANLY THOUGH NOT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT
AN ENGAGEMENT BEING FRAMED TO SUPPORT THE COMMONWEALTH WITHOUT KING OR HOUSE OF PEERS THE ARMY WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY BROUGHT TO SUBSCRIBE IT
NAY TO FURNISH MONEY TO THE CROWN FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE PROTECTOR AT THE TIME HIS ALLIANCE WAS COURTED BY EVERY POWER IN EUROPE ANXIOUSLY COURTED THE ALLIANCE OF SWEDEN
I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE
GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS
THE SPANIARDS RECOVERED SPIRIT AND ATTACKED THEM
HIS EXTENSIVE CAPACITY ENABLED HIM TO FORM THE MOST ENLARGED PROJECTS
IN VAIN WAS RECOURSE HAD TO RELATIONS TO COMPANIONS TO FRIENDS
AND MOST OF THEM BEING DESCENDED OF GOOD FAMILIES AND BY REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW PRINCIPLES WHICH DEPRESSED THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN HAD ENLISTED UNDER THE ROYAL STANDARD
THEN WAS CELEBRATED THE SAGACITY OF PYM MORE FITTED FOR USE THAN ORNAMENT
GREAT INGENUITY HOWEVER AND VIGOR OF THOUGHT SOMETIMES BREAK OUT AMIDST THOSE UNNATURAL CONCEPTIONS
THEY OPENLY DENIED HOWEVER THE CLAIM OF DOMINION IN THE SEAS BEYOND THE FRITHS BAYS AND SHORES
FOR BESIDES THE INJURY TO YOU I WAS ALWAYS DIFFIDENT OF HIS JUDGMENT THOUGH I COULD NOT THINK HIM SO EXTREMELY WEAK AS NOW TO MY COST I HAVE FOUND WHICH YOU MAY EASILY PERCEIVE IN A POSTSCRIPT OF A LETTER OF MINE TO YOU CARTE VOL
AND DISSOLVED EVERY MORAL AND CIVIL OBLIGATION 9 RUSH
DURING THE ENSUING YEARS TILL THE RESTORATION HE LIVED ABROAD IN GREAT NECESSITY AND SAW WITH INDIFFERENCE HIS OPULENT FORTUNE SEQUESTERED BY THOSE WHO ASSUMED THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND
AND THE ARMY HOPING BY TERROR ALONE TO EFFECT ALL THEIR PURPOSES STOPPED AT ST ALBANS AND ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATION WITH THEIR MASTERS
NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
ESSEX'S ARMY HAD BEEN FULLY SUPPLIED WITH ALL NECESSARIES FROM LONDON
BY HIS PROFOUND AND ARTFUL CONDUCT HE HAD NOW ATTAINED A SITUATION WHERE HE COULD COVER HIS ENTERPRISES FROM PUBLIC VIEW
227
TO THE GREAT SURPRISE AND CONSTERNATION OF ALL MEN MONK PREPARED HIMSELF FOR OBEDIENCE
THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
SEE NOTE Q AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THIS AUTHOR WAS MUCH MORE PRAISED AND ADMIRED DURING HIS LIFETIME AND CELEBRATED AFTER HIS DEATH THAN THE GREAT MILTON
AND LORD SPENCER REMARKED THAT THE HUMILIATION THAT DAY SEEMED CONFINED ALONE TO THE PRELATES

AND BEING ESCORTED BY SEVEN DUTCH SHIPS OF WAR WHO WERE SENT TO GUARD THE HERRING FISHERY HE ARRIVED IN THE FRITH OF CROMARTY
THESE ARGUMENTS SECONDED BY THE ADVICE OF THE QUEEN MOTHER AND OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE THE KING'S BROTHER-IN-LAW WHO BOTH OF THEM THOUGHT IT RIDICULOUS TO REFUSE A KINGDOM MERELY FROM REGARD TO EPISCOPACY HAD GREAT INFLUENCE ON CHARLES
IT IS NOT IMPROPER TO TAKE NOTICE OF A MISTAKE COMMITTED BY CLARENDON MUCH TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS GALLANT NOBLEMAN
CHARLES IN THE MEAN TIME FOUND HIS AUTHORITY ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED AS WELL AS HIS CHARACTER DEGRADED
ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS WERE HELD BY THE BISHOPS IN THEIR OWN NAME WITHOUT ANY NOTICE TAKEN OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY
THE ENVIOUS NATURE OF HUNTLEY JEALOUS OF MONTROSE'S GLORY RENDERED HIM AVERSE TO JOIN AN ARMY WHERE HE HIMSELF MUST BE SO MUCH ECLIPSED BY THE SUPERIOR MERIT OF THE GENERAL
HE WAS DISINTERESTED
BUT THAT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A UNIFORMITY OF CONDUCT HE MUST AT PRESENT FOREGO THE APOLOGY OF HIS INNOCENCE LEST BY RATIFYING AN AUTHORITY NO BETTER FOUNDED THAN THAT OF ROBBERS AND PIRATES HE BE JUSTLY BRANDED AS THE BETRAYER INSTEAD OF BEING APPLAUDED AS THE MARTYR OF THE CONSTITUTION
A PRINCIPLE WHICH IN HIM SEEMS TO HAVE CONTAINED NOTHING FIERCE OR GLOOMY NOTHING WHICH ENRAGED HIM AGAINST HIS ADVERSARIES OR TERRIFIED HIM WITH THE DISMAL PROSPECT OF FUTURITY
AND MOST OF THE OFFICERS HAVING RISEN FROM THE DREGS OF THE PEOPLE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT IF DEPRIVED OF THEIR COMMISSION THAN THAT OF RETURNING TO LANGUISH IN THEIR NATIVE POVERTY AND OBSCURITY
WHEN THOSE WHO ENTERED HIS CHAMBER FOUND ON THE TABLE SOME LETTERS DIRECTED TO THE PARLIAMENT TO THE GENERAL AND TO THE OFFICER WHO HAD ATTENDED HIM CLARENDON VOL
COULD IT BE SUSPECTED THAT ANY MAN ANY PRINCE MUCH LESS SUCH A ONE WHOSE WORD WAS AS YET SACRED AND INVIOLATE WOULD FOR SO SMALL A MOTIVE FORFEIT HIS HONOR AND WITH IT ALL FUTURE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE BY BREAKING A PROMISE SO PUBLIC AND SO SOLEMN
THE VOTE TOO OF NON-ADDRESSES WAS REPEALED
CARRIED BY HIS NATURAL TEMPER TO MAGNANIMITY TO GRANDEUR AND TO AN IMPERIOUS AND DOMINEERING POLICY HE YET KNEW WHEN NECESSARY TO EMPLOY THE MOST PROFOUND DISSIMULATION THE MOST OBLIQUE AND REFINED ARTIFICE THE SEMBLANCE OF THE GREATEST MODERATION AND SIMPLICITY
IMMEDIATELY THEY TOOK SANCTUARY IN THE CHURCHES
NOR DID THESE PERSONS APPEAR ANY FURTHER ACTIVE IN THE ENTERPRISES OF WHICH THEY WERE ACCUSED THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES

SOMETHING HOWEVER OF THE VAST AND UNBOUNDED CHARACTERIZED HIS ACTIONS AND DEPORTMENT
THEY GAVE SIR GEORGE BOOTH AND HIS PARTY THEIR LIBERTY AND ESTATES

THOUGH EVERY THING IN THAT PARTICULAR DAILY BORE A WORSE ASPECT

10TH AUG
THE INDEPENDENTS INSISTED THAT THE WORDS GOOD OFFICES SHOULD BE STRUCK OUT
AND WHEN AFTER A LONG DEBATE IT WAS CARRIED BY A SMALL MAJORITY HE TOLD LORD FALKLAND THAT IF THE QUESTION HAD BEEN LOST HE WAS RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO HAVE CONVERTED INTO READY MONEY THE REMAINS OF HIS FORTUNE AND IMMEDIATELY TO HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM
THE KING RETURNED TO HIS FORMER QUARTERS
1260
AND BRINGING NO PRAISE WITH HIM BUT THE VULGAR ONE OF COURAGE AND PERSONAL BRAVERY
IT WAS RESOLVED THAT HERTFORD AND PRINCE MAURICE SHOULD PROCEED WITH THE CAVALRY
AND HOW PASSIONATE A WRITER HE IS MUST BE OBVIOUS TO EVERY ONE
AND THE COMMONS HAD ARTFULLY THIS SESSION CONCEALED THEIR INTENTION OF INVADING THAT BRANCH OF REVENUE TILL THE ROYAL ASSENT HAD BEEN OBTAINED TO THE PETITION OF RIGHT WHICH THEY JUSTLY DEEMED OF SUCH IMPORTANCE
481
IN VAIN ARE PRECEDENTS OF ANCIENT WRITS PRODUCED
AND IN THE EIGHT AND TWENTIETH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING EDWARD III IT WAS DECLARED AND ENACTED BY AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT THAT NO MAN OF WHAT ESTATE OR CONDITION THAT HE BE SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF HIS LAND OR TENEMENTS NOR TAKEN NOR IMPRISONED NOR DISPIRITED NOR PUT TO DEATH WITHOUT BEING BROUGHT TO ANSWER BY DUE PROCESS OF LAW
AND THOUGH SEVERAL SUBSIDIES TOGETHER WITH A POLL-TAX WERE FROM TIME TO TIME VOTED TO ANSWER THE CHARGE THE COMMONS STILL TOOK CARE TO BE IN DEBT IN ORDER TO RENDER THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SESSION THE MORE NECESSARY
AMONG OTHER REASONS THEY INSISTED UPON THE DIVINE VENGEANCE WHICH ENGLAND MIGHT JUSTLY DREAD FOR TOLERATING ANTI-CHRISTIAN IDOLATRY ON PRETENCE OF CIVIL CONTRACTS AND POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.[V RELIGION THOUGH EVERY DAY EMPLOYED AS THE ENGINE OF THEIR OWN AMBITIOUS PURPOSES WAS SUPPOSED TOO SACRED TO BE YIELDED UP TO THE TEMPORAL INTERESTS OR SAFETY OF KINGDOMS
THE QUESTIONING FINING AND IMPRISONING OF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONDUCT IN THE HOUSE
AND THUS THE WHOLE BROTHERLY FRIENDSHIP AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE WITH THE SCOTS RESOLVED ITSELF INTO AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR BEING WELL-BRED GENTLEMEN
THE PRINCE HEARING OF ESSEX'S APPROACH RETIRED TO THE MAIN BODY THIS RENCOUNTER THOUGH IN ITSELF OF SMALL IMPORTANCE MIGHTILY RAISED THE REPUTATION OF THE ROYALISTS AND ACQUIRED TO PRINCE RUPERT THE CHARACTER OF PROMPTITUDE AND COURAGE
THE KING RESOLVED TO ACCEPT OF THIS LAST OFFER
751
751
254
AND HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO FORTIFY HIMSELF FOR HIS DEFENCE A MULTITUDE CONSISTING OF TWO THOUSAND SECRETARIES ENTERED ST PAUL'S WHERE THE HIGH COMMISSION THEN SAT TORE DOWN THE BENCHES AND CRIED OUT NO BISHOP
AND ALL THE MEN OF JUDAH ANSWERED THE MEN OF ISRAEL BECAUSE THE KING IS NEAR OF KIN TO US
AND THOUGH FORTUNE HAD THUS BALANCED HER FAVORS THE KING'S PARTY STILL REMAINED MUCH SUPERIOR IN THOSE PARTS OF ENGLAND
AND TO EVERY MAN BUT HIMSELF AND TO HIMSELF EXCEPT WHERE NECESSITY REQUIRED THE CONTRARY THE LAW WAS THE GREAT RULE OF CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR
IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE PAST USURPATIONS OF THE CROWN HOWEVER EXCUSABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE NECESSITY OR PROVOCATIONS WHENCE THEY AROSE HAVE EXCITED AN IMMEASURABLE APPETITE FOR LIBERTY
SUCH CONVERSIONS IF EVER THEY HAPPEN ARE EXTREMELY RARE
IN VAIN DID STRAFFORD'S FRIENDS ADD AS A FURTHER APOLOGY THAT MOUNTNORRIS WAS A MAN OF AN INFAMOUS CHARACTER WHO PAID COURT BY THE LOWEST ADULATION TO ALL DEPUTIES WHILE PRESENT AND BLACKENED THEIR CHARACTER BY THE VILEST CALUMNIES WHEN RECALLED
I DESIRE THAT THE LAWS MAY EVER BE THE MEASURE OF MY GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE LIBERTY AND PROPERTY OF THE SUBJECT MAY BE PRESERVED BY THEM WITH THE SAME CARE AS MY OWN JUST RIGHTS
THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE ROYALISTS THREATENED THE PARLIAMENT WITH IMMEDIATE SUBJECTION
EVEN THAT TO THE BALTIC WAS MUCH INFESTED BY ENGLISH PRIVATEERS
BEING TOTALLY UNPROVIDED WITH MILITARY FORCE AND FINDING A REFRACTORY INDEPENDENT SPIRIT TO PREVAIL AMONG THE PEOPLE THE MOST SOLID BASIS OF HIS AUTHORITY HE THOUGHT CONSISTED IN THE SUPPORT WHICH HE RECEIVED FROM THE HIERARCHY
ONE BARREL OF POWDER WAS THEIR WHOLE STOCK OF AMMUNITION REMAINING
AND INDULGENCE WAS GRANTED TO NONE AFTER THE CHILDREN OF THE FIRST DENIZENS.[V RUSHWORTH VOL
HAVING PUT FIVE THOUSAND LAND FORCES ON BOARD HE INTRUSTED IT TO THE MARQUIS OF HAMILTON WHO HAD ORDERS TO SAIL TO THE FRITH OF FORTH AND TO CAUSE A DIVERSION IN THE FORCES OF THE MALECONTENTS
WHERE DID HE STAND WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DRINK THIS HEALTH SUBJOINED THE EARL HE WAS AT THE DOOR THEY REPLIED GOING OUT OF THE ROOM TUSH CRIED HE THE DRAWER MUST BE MISTAKEN
THAT STRAFFORD WAS SECRETLY NO ENEMY TO ARBITRARY COUNSELS APPEARS FROM SOME OF HIS LETTERS AND DESPATCHES PARTICULARLY VOL
THE NUMBERS OF THIS PARLIAMENT WERE SMALL LITTLE EXCEEDING SEVENTY MEMBERS
IT IS STILL OUR DUTY HE SAID TO THE SEAMEN TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY INTO WHAT HANDS SOEVER THE GOVERNMENT MAY FALL DISINTERESTED GENEROUS LIBERAL
THAT HE MIGHT BIND HIMSELF BY RECIPROCAL TIES HE SOLEMNLY MADE THE FOLLOWING DECLARATION BEFORE HIS WHOLE ARMY
THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT

THEY PROFESSED TO RETURN TO THEIR DUTY AND ALLEGIANCE ENGAGED TO FURNISH TEN THOUSAND MEN FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE KING'S AUTHORITY IN ENGLAND AND WERE CONTENT WITH STIPULATING IN RETURN INDEMNITY FOR THEIR REBELLION AND TOLERATION OF THEIR RELIGION
AND AS CHARLES IN A COMPLICATION OF INSTANCES HAD LATELY VIOLATED THEM
THERE WERE CERTAINLY MUCH LONGER PRAYERS SAID IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY
THE KING HIMSELF HAVING GIVEN MANY PROOFS OF PERSONAL VALOR WAS OBLIGED TO FLY
MANY INLAND GARRISONS WERE COMMANDED BY OFFICER
AN AIR OF PROBITY AND GOODNESS RUNS THROUGH THE WHOLE WORK
FEARS HOPES AND PARTY ZEAL INTERESTED MULTITUDES TO DISCOVER HIM

AND IN ALL THEIR TRANSACTIONS WITH HIM PAID NO LONGER ANY REGARD TO EQUITY OR REASON
CROMWELL HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS WHERE HIS STRENGTH LAY
UNDER COLOR OF ADVICE THEY MAY GIVE DISGUISED ORDERS
THE HOUSES OUT OF THEIR DETESTATION TO THAT ABOMINABLE IDOLATRY USED IN THE MASS DO DECLARE THAT THEY CANNOT ADMIT OF OR CONSENT UNTO ANY SUCH INDULGENCE IN ANY LAW AS IS DESIRED BY HIS MAJESTY FOR EXEMPTING THE QUEEN AND HER FAMILY FROM THE PENALTIES TO BE ENACTED AGAINST THE EXERCISE OF THE MASS WALKER P
MODERATE REASONABLE SUCH AS MEN OF CHARACTER WILLINGLY SUBSCRIBED
AND HAVING THERE MADE THE SAME DEMANDS THE DEY OF THAT REPUBLIC BADE HIM LOOK TO THE CASTLES OF PORTO-FARINO AND GOLETTA AND DO HIS UTMOST
EVEN IF THE KING HAD GIVEN A COMMISSION TO GLAMORGAN TO CONCLUDE THAT TREATY AND HAD RATIFIED IT WILL ANY REASONABLE MAN IN OUR AGE THINK IT STRANGE THAT IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE HIS CROWN HIS FAMILY HIS FRIENDS AND HIS PARTY HE SHOULD MAKE A TREATY WITH PAPISTS AND GRANT THEM VERY LARGE CONCESSIONS FOR THEIR RELIGION
AND WHEN MEN WERE ENLISTED IN PARTY IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT THEY THOUGHT TO LEAD THEM BY DEGREES INTO MANY MEASURES FOR WHICH THEY FORMERLY ENTERTAINED THE GREATEST AVERSION
THE EXTENSIVE EMPIRE AND YET EXTREME WEAKNESS OF SPAIN IN THE WEST INDIES THE VIGOROUS COURAGE AND GREAT NAVAL POWER OF ENGLAND WERE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WHEN COMPARED EXCITED THE AMBITION OF THE ENTERPRISING PROTECTOR AND MADE HIM HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BY SOME GAINFUL CONQUEST RENDER FOREVER ILLUSTRIOUS THAT DOMINION WHICH HE HAD ASSUMED OVER HIS COUNTRY
WE ROSE UP PRESENTLY AND JUST AS THE MAN WAS LEADING OUT HIS HORSE SADDLED WE CAME UP TO HIM WITH DRAWN SWORDS AND TOLD HIM WE WERE TO SEARCH ALL THAT WENT IN AND OUT THERE
THE MANAGERS DIVIDED THE SEVERAL ARTICLES AMONG THEM AND ATTACKED THE PRISONER WITH ALL THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY WITH ALL THE VEHEMENCE OF RHETORIC WITH ALL THE ACCURACY OF LONG PREPARATION
AND AS FEAR SO FLATTERY TAKETH AWAY THE JUDGMENT
AND BEING CONDUCTED TO THE PARLIAMENT'S QUARTERS WERE DISMISSED
ALL THE DISPERSED BODIES OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WERE NOW ORDERED TO MARCH TO NORTHAMPTON
AND THOUGH IT IS NO RULE WITHOUT OR AGAINST THE WORD YET IT IS A VERY GOOD EXPOSITOR OF THE WORD IN MANY CASES CONFERENCE AT WHITEHALL
AND HE FIRST INSTITUTED THAT DISCIPLINE AND INSPIRED THAT SPIRIT WHICH RENDERED THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMIES IN THE END VICTORIOUS
I PERCEIVED HER TO BE A MOST ABSOLUTE DELICATE LADY AFTER I HAD EXACTLY SURVEYED ALL THE FEATURES OF HER FACE MUCH ENLIVENED BY HER RADIANT AND SPARKLING BLACK EYES
410 411 412
SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
SOON AFTER HE ABANDONED A CAUSE POLLUTED BY SO MANY CRIMES
WERE NOT BOTH YOUR AND OUR EXPECTATIONS RENEWED FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE WE WAITED ON GOD TO SEE WHICH WAY HE WOULD MANIFEST HIMSELF UPON OUR APPEALS

THE CONSPIRACY OF THE MILLENARIANS IN THE ARMY STRUCK CROMWELL WITH STILL GREATER APPREHENSIONS

YET STILL GREAT DOUBTS WERE ENTERTAINED ON THIS HEAD

TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC FROM DOMESTIC QUARRELS TOWARDS FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS SEEMED IN THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS TO BE GOOD POLICY
DON ALONZO DE CARDENAS THE SPANISH ENVOY WAS THE FIRST PUBLIC MINISTER WHO RECOGNIZED THE AUTHORITY OF THE NEW REPUBLIC
WHILE THE KING INSTIGATED BY ANGER AND NECESSITY THUS EMPLOYED THE WHOLE EXTENT OF HIS PREROGATIVE THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE WAS FAR FROM BEING SUBDUED
THIS LEGISLATIVE POWER THEY WERE TO EXERCISE DURING FIFTEEN MONTHS
MORE ESCAPED
THESE MEDITATIONS RESEMBLE IN ELEGANCE PURITY NEATNESS AND SIMPLICITY THE GENIUS OF THOSE PERFORMANCES WHICH WE KNOW WITH CERTAINTY TO HAVE FLOWED FROM THE ROYAL PEN
DE RUITER THE ONLY ADMIRAL IN EUROPE WHO HAS ATTAINED A RENOWN EQUAL TO THAT OF THE GREATEST GENERAL DEFENDED HIMSELF SO WELL THAT AYSCUE GAINED NO ADVANTAGE OVER HIM
AND THAT THE HIGHER HE SCREWED UP THE SPRINGS OF GOVERNMENT WHILE HE HAD SO LITTLE REAL POWER TO RETAIN THEM IN THAT FORCED SITUATION WITH MORE FATAL VIOLENCE MUST THEY FLY OUT WHEN ANY ACCIDENT OCCURRED TO RESTORE THEM TO THEIR NATURAL ACTION
THE SECOND WERE THE DEISTS WHO HAD NO OTHER OBJECT THAN POLITICAL LIBERTY WHO DENIED ENTIRELY THE TRUTH OF REVELATION AND INSINUATED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS SECTS SO HEATED AGAINST EACH OTHER WERE ALIKE FOUNDED IN FOLLY AND IN ERROR
COMMAND A MUTINOUS ARMY BY MEANS OF SEDITIOUS AND FACTIOUS OFFICERS
AND THE LAWS RAN IN THE NAME OF KING LORDS AND COMMONS
IT IS DANGEROUS ALSO BY THESE EXAMPLES TO REDUCE PRINCES TO DESPAIR OR BRING MATTERS TO SUCH EXTREMITIES AGAINST PERSONS ENDOWED WITH GREAT POWER AS TO LEAVE THEM NO RESOURCE BUT IN THE MOST VIOLENT AND MOST SANGUINARY COUNSELS
A COURT LADY DAUGHTER OF THE EARL OF DEVONSHIRE HAVING TURNED CATHOLIC WAS ASKED BY LAUD THE REASON OF HER CONVERSION
THAT THE SECRETARY'S DEPOSITION WAS AT FIRST EXCEEDINGLY DUBIOUS
AND HE RETURNED THIS SPIRITED AND MEMORABLE ANSWER
THOSE WHO HEARD OF THE COMMOTIONS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD INSTEAD OF DESERTING THEIR HABITATIONS AND ASSEMBLING FOR MUTUAL PROTECTION REMAINED AT HOME IN HOPES OF DEFENDING THEIR PROPERTY AND FELL THUS SEPARATELY INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES AFTER RAPACITY HAD FULLY EXERTED ITSELF CRUELTY AND THE MOST BARBAROUS THAT EVER IN ANY NATION WAS KNOWN OR HEARD OF BEGAN ITS OPERATIONS

THE HOUSE AGAIN MET
FIFTY THOUSAND BRITISH TROOPS WERE LED TO MUTUAL SLAUGHTER
FROM THE NATURE TOO OF THE HUMAN FRAME IT MAY BE EXPECTED THAT THIS LIBERTY WOULD BE EXERTED IN ITS FULL EXTENT AND NO BRANCH OF AUTHORITY BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN UNMOLESTED IN THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE
EVEN THE COURT PARTY PRETENDED NOT TO PLEAD IN DEFENCE OF THE LATE MEASURES ANY THING BUT THE NECESSITY TO WHICH THE KING HAD BEEN REDUCED BY THE OBSTINACY OF THE TWO FORMER PARLIAMENTS
ABOVE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE ASSEMBLED IN A TUMULTUOUS MANNER IN EDINBURGH AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE KING'S PREROGATIVES ARE THE SUNBEAMS OF THE CROWN AND AS INSEPARABLE FROM IT AS THE SUNBEAMS FROM THE SUN
HIS HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HIS HANDS LEANING UPON HIS HORSE'S NECK
REDUCE TO SUBJECTION A WARLIKE AND DISCONTENTED NATION BY MEANS OF A MUTINOUS ARMY
THE GREAT DANGERS INCURRED DURING FORMER USURPATIONS JOINED TO THE EXTREME CAUTION OF THE GENERAL KEPT EVERY ONE IN AWE
YET WAS CHARLES INFLEXIBLE
THAT AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE OF THIS SEASON SHOULD AFTERWARDS BE ALLOWED THEM FOR THAT PURPOSE
ALL THE MAGAZINES OF ARMS AND AMUNITION WERE FROM THE FIRST SEIZED BY THE PARLIAMENT
BESIDES THE CHAIR OF STATE A CLOSE GALLERY WAS PREPARED FOR THE KING AND QUEEN WHO ATTENDED DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL RUSH
AND BY THEIR CLAMOR NOISE AND VIOLENCE OBLIGED THEM TO REVERSE THAT VOTE WHICH THEY HAD PASSED SO LATELY
WHERE THAT NOBLEMAN ASSERTS THAT HE HIMSELF WAS THE AUTHOR OF MOST OF THESE REMONSTRANCES AND MEMORIALS OF THE KING FOOTNOTE 12
WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM
AND THE KING FOR THAT VERY REASON HAD EVER ENDEAVORED WITH THE LEAST OFFENSIVE EXPRESSIONS TO DECLINE IT EARLY THIS SPRING THE EARL OF LOUDON THE CHANCELLOR WITH OTHER COMMISSIONERS AND ATTENDED BY HENDERSON A POPULAR AND INTRIGUING PREACHER WAS SENT TO THE KING AT OXFORD AND RENEWED THE OFFER OF MEDIATION
HAVING REACHED THAT PITCH OF PERFECTION AS TO NEED NO OTHER BOOK HE SOON ADVANCED TO ANOTHER STATE OF SPIRITUAL PROGRESS AND BEGAN TO PAY LESS REGARD EVEN TO THAT DIVINE COMPOSITION ITSELF
THE CRY INCESSANTLY RESOUNDED AGAINST BISHOPS AND ROTTEN-HEARTED LORDS THE FORMER ESPECIALLY BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK HAVING BEEN ABUSED BY THE POPULACE HASTILY CALLED A MEETING OF HIS BRETHREN
THE PULPITS DELIVERED OVER TO PURITANICAL PREACHERS AND LECTURERS WHOM THE COMMONS ARBITRARILY SETTLED IN ALL THE CONSIDERABLE CHURCHES RESOUNDED WITH FACTION AND FANATICISM
THE MADNESS OF THE SCOTTISH ECCLESIASTICS SAVED HIM FROM THIS LOSS AND DISHONOR
REENFORCED BY ADDITIONAL TROOPS WHICH FLOCKED TO HIM FROM ALL QUARTERS HE SO MUCH SURPASSED THE ROYALISTS IN NUMBER THAT THEY DURST NO LONGER CONTINUE THEIR MARCH OR EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO THE HAZARD OF AN ACTION
BUT THE DIFFICULTY STILL REMAINED WHO THAT PERSON SHOULD BE
THE SEVERITY OF MANNERS SO MUCH AFFECTED BY THESE ZEALOUS RELIGIONISTS ASSISTED THEIR MILITARY INSTITUTIONS AND THE RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF CHARACTER BY WHICH THE AUSTERE REFORMERS OF CHURCH AND STATE WERE DISTINGUISHED ENABLED THE PARLIAMENTARY CHIEFS TO RESTRAIN THEIR SOLDIERS WITHIN STRICTER RULES AND MORE EXACT ORDER
BUT THERE REMAINED TWO OTHER BRANCHES OF THE LEGISLATURE THE KING AND THE LORDS WHOSE ASSENT WAS REQUISITE
THOUGH THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS PURITANS MUTUALLY LENT ASSISTANCE TO EACH OTHER THERE WERE MANY WHO JOINED THE FORMER YET DECLINED ALL CONNECTION WITH THE LATTER
114
HE EVEN THUNDERED OUT A SENTENCE OF EXCOMMUNICATION AGAINST ALL WHO SHOULD ADHERE TO A PEACE SO PREJUDICIAL AS HE PRETENDED TO THE CATHOLIC RELIGION
GEORGE FOX BORN AT DRAYTON IN LANCASHIRE IN 1624 WAS THE FOUNDER OF THIS SECT
YET ALL THESE CONSIDERATIONS COULD NOT RECONCILE THE PEOPLE TO THE IMPOSITION
THAT THOUGH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN THIS MANNER TO THE PEOPLE HE MUST NOW FREELY INFORM THE HOUSE THAT THE FEWER ENGAGEMENTS WERE EXACTED THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE WOULD THEIR PLAN PROVE AND THE MORE SATISFACTION WOULD IT GIVE TO THE NATION
ON THIS OCCASION THE COMMONS RENEWED THEIR ETERNAL COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE GROWTH OF POPERY WHICH WAS EVER THE CHIEF OF THEIR GRIEVANCES AND NOW THEIR ONLY ONE THEY DEMANDED A STRICT EXECUTION OF THE PENAL LAWS AGAINST THE CATHOLICS AND REMONSTRATED AGAINST SOME LATE PARDONS GRANTED TO PRIESTS THEY ATTACKED MONTAGUE ONE OF THE KING'S CHAPLAINS ON ACCOUNT OF A MODERATE BOOK WHICH HE HAD LATELY PUBLISHED AND WHICH TO THEIR GREAT DISGUST SAVED VIRTUOUS CATHOLICS AS WELL AS OTHER CHRISTIANS FROM ETERNAL TORMENTS JOURN
AFTER ALL THE OLD JAILS WERE FULL MANY NEW ONES WERE ERECTED
THE CHIEF TAXES IN ENGLAND DURING THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH WERE THE MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS THE EXCISE AND THE CUSTOMS
AND AS HIS COUNTRYMEN FOUND SOME REALITY IN THESE PRETENSIONS THEIR NATIONAL VANITY BEING GRATIFIED MADE THEM BEAR WITH MORE PATIENCE ALL THE INDIGNITIES AND CALAMITIES UNDER WHICH THEY LABORED
HE MADE THE SAME REPLY AS TO THE KING
TO ENUMERATE THEM ALL WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
115 116 117
THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION
NO VICTORY COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THIS WHICH WAS OBTAINED BY CROMWELL
THE THREE SPECIES OF GOVERNMENT MONARCHICAL ARISTOCRATICAL AND DEMOCRATICAL ARE THERE PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED AND THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT IS EXPRESSLY SAID TO BE NONE OF THEM PURE BUT ALL OF THEM MIXED AND TEMPERED TOGETHER
SEE BROME'S TRAVELS INTO ENGLAND P
AND MANY PERSONS WERE NOW IN HIS EYE MANY NOW DARED TO PRONOUNCE SENTENCE OF DEATH UPON HIM WHOSE LIFE FORFEITED BY THE LAWS OF WAR HE HAD FORMERLY SAVED FROM THE FURY OF THE SOLDIERS
ALL DISTINCTION OF PARTIES BEING IN A MANNER DROPPED THE MOST DEVOTED FRIENDS OF THE CHURCH AND MONARCHY WISHED THERE FOR SUCH SUCCESS TO THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES AS MIGHT PUT AN END TO THESE OPPRESSIONS
CHESTER SURRENDERED
YET NOTWITHSTANDING THIS DECLARED OPINION OF THE JUDGES NOTWITHSTANDING THE GREAT POWER AND SOMETIMES RIGOROUS MAXIMS OF THE CROWN NOTWITHSTANDING THE SMALL PROSPECT OF RELIEF FROM PARLIAMENT HE RESOLVED RATHER THAN TAMELY SUBMIT TO SO ILLEGAL AN IMPOSITION TO STAND A LEGAL PROSECUTION AND EXPOSE HIMSELF TO ALL THE INDIGNATION OF THE COURT
AND POLITICS NO LONGER RESTRAINED THEIR MAGISTRATES FROM PROMOTING AND EXPRESSING THAT SENTIMENT
A FIRM DETERMINATION HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO OF UTTERLY ABOLISHING EPISCOPACY
SIR RICHARD GRANVILLE ON A THIRD
THE THOUGHT NO LONGER BENT ON THAT DIVINE AND MYSTERIOUS ESSENCE SO SUPERIOR TO THE NARROW CAPACITIES OF MANKIND WAS ABLE BY MEANS OF THE NEW MODEL OF DEVOTION TO RELAX ITSELF IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF PICTURES POSTURES VESTMENTS BUILDINGS
THE ERRORS OF HIS LIFE PROCEEDED MORE FROM WANT OF COURAGE THAN OF HONOR OR INTEGRITY
THOUGH NOBODY OF RANK SEEMED AS YET TO COUNTENANCE THEM ALL MEN HOWEVER BEGAN TO UNICE AND TO ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELIGIOUS INNOVATIONS INTRODUCED INTO THE KINGDOM
BOUGHS WERE CARRIED IN THIS TUMULTUOUS PROCESSION
69 77 V WALKER P
LORD BROGHILL PRESIDENT OF MUNSTER AND SIR CHARLES COOTE PRESIDENT OF CONNAUGHT WENT SO FAR AS TO ENTER INTO A CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE KING AND TO PROMISE THEIR ASSISTANCE FOR HIS RESTORATION
IT IS MORE AGREEABLE THEREFORE TO REASON AS WELL AS CANDOR TO SUPPOSE THAT MONK AS SOON AS HE PUT HIMSELF IN MOTION HAD ENTERTAINED VIEWS OF EFFECTING THE KING'S RESTORATION
THEY SET ASIDE THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE ARMY WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER IT
155
AFTER THE DEATH OF BUCKINGHAM WHO HAD SOMEWHAT ALIENATED CHARLES FROM THE QUEEN SHE IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS HIS CHIEF FRIEND AND FAVORITE
HE WAS UNABLE TO COMMAND THEM OR KEEP THE BOX
IN IRELAND IT WAS STILL MORE REQUISITE AMONG A RUDE PEOPLE NOT YET THOROUGHLY SUBDUED AVERSE TO THE RELIGION AND MANNERS OF THEIR CONQUERORS READY ON ALL OCCASIONS TO RELAPSE INTO REBELLION AND DISORDER
BESIDES THAT THESE WRITERS HAD ATTACKED WITH GREAT SEVERITY AND EVEN AN INTEMPERATE ZEAL THE CEREMONIES RITES AND GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH THE VERY ANSWERS WHICH THEY GAVE IN TO THE COURT WERE SO FULL OF CONTUMACY AND OF INVECTIVES AGAINST THE PRELATES THAT NO LAWYER COULD BE PREVAILED ON TO SIGN THEM THE RIGORS HOWEVER WHICH THEY UNDERWENT BEING SO UNWORTHY MEN OF THEIR PROFESSION GAVE GENERAL OFFENCE
THOUGH HIS DEATH WAS LOUDLY DEMANDED AS A SATISFACTION TO JUSTICE AND AN ATONEMENT FOR THE MANY VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY SAFELY BE AFFIRMED THAT THE SENTENCE BY WHICH HE FELL WAS AN ENORMITY GREATER THAN THE WORST OF THOSE WHICH HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES PROSECUTED WITH SO MUCH CRUEL INDUSTRY
IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT SUCH MESSENGERS COULD BRING LESS THAN A DEFIANCE
FOREIGN ENEMIES AS WELL AS DOMESTIC FACTIONS BEING DEPRIVED OF THIS RESOURCE THAT KINGDOM BEGAN NOW TO SHINE FORTH IN ITS FULL SPLENDOR
BUT BEING DESTITUTE OF POWER
THE TWO ARMIES FACED EACH OTHER AT CROPREDY BRIDGE NEAR BANBURY
HE WAS PARTICULARLY DESIROUS OF CONQUEST AND DOMINION ON THE CONTINENT AND HE SENT OVER INTO FLANDERS SIX THOUSAND MEN UNDER REYNOLDS WHO JOINED THE FRENCH ARMY COMMANDED BY TURENNE
THEY DISARMED THE CROWN
THAT THIS ATTEMPT WAS A BREACH OF THE TRUST REPOSED IN HIM BY HIS PEOPLE CONTRARY TO HIS OATH AND TENDING TO A DISSOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT
565 RUSH
AND ABOVE ALL THE LARGE DEMESNES OF THE CROWN WITH THE SMALL EXPENSE OF GOVERNMENT DURING THAT PERIOD RENDERED THE PRINCE ALMOST INDEPENDENT AND TAUGHT THE PARLIAMENT TO PRESERVE GREAT SUBMISSION AND DUTY TOWARDS HIM
THE PROGRESS OF THE INDEPENDENTS GAVE THEM GREAT ALARM
AND THAT NO HUMAN INSTITUTION COULD BE BETTER POISED AND ADJUSTED THAN WAS NOW THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND
ALL THESE HAD LIKEWISE BEEN PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS AND WERE MEN EMINENT IN THEIR PROFESSION WHITLOCKE P

A UNIVERSAL MASSACRE COMMENCED OF THE ENGLISH NOW DEFENCELESS AND PASSIVELY RESIGNED TO THEIR INHUMAN FOES
BUT THEIR INTERCESSION DID HARM
LORD CAPEL UNDERWENT THE SAME FATE
IN WHICH HE PARDONED ALL PAST OFFENCES AND EXHORTED THE PEOPLE TO BE MORE OBEDIENT FOR THE FUTURE AND TO SUBMIT PEACEABLY TO THE USE OF THE LITURGY
THE STROKES OF HIS CHARACTER ARE AS OPEN AND STRONGLY MARKED AS THE SCHEMES OF HIS CONDUCT WERE DURING THE TIME DARK AND IMPENETRABLE
AND CHALLENGED THE WHOLE POWER WHICH THEY PROFESSEDLY INTENDED TO EMPLOY TO THE PUNISHMENT OF ALL THE KING'S FRIENDS FOOTNOTE 13
THE GARRISON AFTER A SLIGHT DEFENCE OFFERED TO CAPITULATE
FOR IF HE DELAYED IT TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS HE WOULD COME TOO LATE
BUT MADE IT SO UNSKILFULLY THAT IT WAS EQUIVALENT TO A TOTAL ROUT
THE EARL OF STRAFFORD WAS CONSIDERED AS CHIEF MINISTER BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CREDIT WHICH HE POSSESSED WITH HIS MASTER AND OF HIS OWN GREAT AND UNCOMMON VIGOR AND CAPACITY
THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY
VITA DE BERWICI P
AND TO HOPE BY ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BREAK THEIR REFRACTORY SPIRITS WITHOUT BEING POSSESSED OF ANY FORCE TO PREVENT RESISTANCE
UPON TWO EXAMINATIONS HE COULD NOT REMEMBER ANY SUCH WORDS
RICHARD WHO POSSESSED NEITHER RESOLUTION NOR PENETRATION WAS PREVAILED ON TO GIVE AN UNGUARDED CONSENT FOR CALLING A GENERAL COUNCIL OF OFFICERS WHO MIGHT MAKE HIM PROPOSALS AS THEY PRETENDED FOR THE GOOD OF THE ARMY
I SHALL ONLY SUGGEST A VERY FEW ARGUMENTS AMONG AN INFINITE NUMBER WHICH OCCUR
THE SOLDIERS MADE MORE DIFFICULTY
THE QUEEN'S ZEAL AND HER AUTHORITY WITH HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THIS IMPRUDENCE SO OFFENSIVE TO THE NATION BUT THE SPIRIT OF BIGOTRY NOW ROSE TOO HIGH TO PERMIT ANY LONGER SUCH INDULGENCES HAYWARD A JUSTICE OF PEACE HAVING BEEN WOUNDED WHEN EMPLOYED IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE BY ONE JAMES A CATHOLIC MADMAN THIS ENORMITY WAS ASCRIBED TO THE POPERY NOT TO THE FRENZY OF THE ASSASSIN
AND THOUGH THE FINAL CONCLUSION OF THE TREATY MUST BE EXECUTED ONLY IN GLAMORGAN'S OWN NAME HE WAS REQUIRED TO BE DIRECTED IN THE STEPS TOWARDS IT BY THE OPINION OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT
AND WE STAND ASTONISHED THAT AMONG A CIVILIZED PEOPLE SO MUCH VIRTUE COULD EVER MEET WITH SO FATAL A CATASTROPHE
A NEW TAX WHICH OF ITSELF WAS LIABLE TO NO OBJECTION BUT APPEARED OF DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE WHEN CONSIDERED AS ARBITRARY AND ILLEGAL MONOPOLIES WERE REVIVED
HOTHAM WAS NO LONGER GOVERNOR OF THIS PLACE
THAT THE GREAT SOURCE OF ALL THE LATE COMMOTIONS HAD BEEN THE JEALOUSY OF LIBERTY

THE FRENCH COURT HAD PROMISED TO SUPPLY HIM WITH A SMALL BODY OF FORCES IN ORDER TO COUNTENANCE THE INSURRECTIONS OF THE ENGLISH
THE PRIVATE DEPORTMENT OF CROMWELL AS A SON A HUSBAND A FATHER A FRIEND IS EXPOSED TO NO CONSIDERABLE CENSURE IF IT DOES NOT RATHER MERIT PRAISE
AND HIS DEATH WOULD NOW ATONE FOR THAT GUILT THE ONLY ONE WITH WHICH HE COULD JUSTLY REPROACH HIMSELF
AND THEIR DISCONTENT WOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE BROKEN OUT INTO SOME RESOLUTION FATAL TO THE PARLIAMENT HAD IT NOT BEEN CHECKED BY THE APPREHENSIONS OF DANGER FROM THE COMMON ENEMY
THAT IN THE EYE OF THE LAW AND ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF COMMON REASON THEY ALONE WERE GUILTY AND WERE ALONE EXPOSED TO CENSURE FOR EVERY BLAMABLE ACTION OF THE PRINCE
AND BY THE EQUALITY AND JUSTICE OF HIS ADMINISTRATION HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE CONTENTMENT TO THAT RESTLESS PEOPLE NOW REDUCED TO SUBJECTION BY A NATION WHOM THEY HATED
BUT THE CHARWELL RAN BETWEEN THEM
BY THIS BILL SOME OF THE NOBLEST AND MOST VALUABLE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN WERE RETRENCHED
BUT BY THE DELAYS OF THE ENGLISH THAT WORK WAS NOW FULLY FINISHED AND FORTIFIED
THE SUM OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS THEY OPENLY TOOK IT IS AFFIRMED AND DIVIDED AMONG THEIR OWN MEMBERS
GLENHAM IN A FEW DAYS WAS OBLIGED TO SURRENDER YORK
STONE HIM RAISED SUCH A TUMULT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED WITH THE SERVICE
THE MILLENARIANS OR FIFTH MONARCHY MEN REQUIRED THAT GOVERNMENT ITSELF SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AND ALL HUMAN POWERS BE LAID IN THE DUST IN ORDER TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE DOMINION OF CHRIST WHOSE SECOND COMING THEY SUDDENLY EXPECTED
BUT I MUST NOW WARN YOU TO PREPARE FOR CLOUDS AND STORMS
IT WAS ONLY EVIL COUNSELLORS WHO SEDUCED AND BETRAYED IT
THOUGH FRUGAL AND REGULAR IN HIS EXPENSE HE WANTED MONEY FOR THE SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT
IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE HIS PEOPLE SHOULD FIND HIS CONDUCT SUITABLE TO A JUST PIOUS AND GRACIOUS KING
THAT THEY WERE DELEGATED BY THE PEOPLE THE ONLY SOURCE OF EVERY LAWFUL POWER
AND WHOEVER WAS OBNOXIOUS TO THE CLERGY FAILED NOT TO HAVE ONE OR OTHER OF THESE EPITHETS AFFIXED TO HIM
ALL THE KING'S ATTENDANTS WERE FULL OF WELL-GROUNDED APPREHENSIONS
BUT AS THE CONTROVERSIES ON EVERY SUBJECT GREW DAILY WARMER MEN UNITED THEMSELVES MORE INTIMATELY WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND SEPARATED THEMSELVES WIDER FROM THEIR ANTAGONISTS
THESE VIOLENCES HOWEVER NECESSARY ARE SURE TO IRRITATE A PRINCE AGAINST LIMITATIONS SO CRUELLY IMPOSED UPON HIM

IN THIS CONTEST HE LAY UNDER GREAT DISADVANTAGES
THIS MESSAGE WAS UNEXPECTED AND EXCEEDINGLY PERPLEXED THE HOUSE
THE CONDITION OF THAT MONARCH TO ALL THE WORLD SEEMED TOTALLY DESPERATE
AND IF THESE FURIOUS EXPEDIENTS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED ON ONE SIDE REVENGE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE PUSHED THE OTHER PARTY AFTER A RETURN OF POWER TO RETALIATE UPON THEIR ENEMIES
BY THE THIRD HE WAS TO ANNUL ALL THE ACTS AND VOID ALL THE PATENTS OF PEERAGE WHICH HAD PASSED THE GREAT SEAL SINCE IT HAD BEEN CARRIED FROM LONDON BY LORD KEEPER LITTLETON
AND UNITING THEMSELVES WITH THE ROYALISTS IN BOTH KINGDOMS ENDEAVOR BY FORCE OF ARMS TO REDUCE THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT TO MORE MODERATE CONDITIONS
797 798 ETC
THEY EXPRESSED THEIR GREAT GRIEF ON ACCOUNT OF HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER TO THEIR JUST AND NECESSARY PETITION
BY GRATIFYING A FEW PERSONS WITH TITLES AND PREFERMENTS HE MIGHT DRAW OVER HE HOPED THE WHOLE MILITARY POWER AND IN AN INSTANT REINSTATE HIMSELF IN HIS CIVIL AUTHORITY
AND THE KING SENSIBLE THAT THEIR RESISTANCE WAS TO VERY LITTLE PURPOSE WILLINGLY COMPLIED
CLARENDON HOWEVER WILL ALWAYS BE ESTEEMED AN ENTERTAINING WRITER EVEN INDEPENDENT OF OUR CURIOSITY TO KNOW THE FACTS WHICH HE RELATES
LORD FALKLAND ALONE THOUGH KNOWN TO BE HIS ENEMY MODESTLY DESIRED THE HOUSE TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BETTER SUIT THE GRAVITY OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS FIRST TO DIGEST BY A COMMITTEE MANY OF THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH HAD BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE THEY SENT UP AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM
WHILE THE PRINCIPAL ARMIES ON BOTH SIDES WERE KEPT IN INACTION BY THE WINTER SEASON THE KING AND PARLIAMENT WERE EMPLOYED IN REAL PREPARATIONS FOR WAR AND IN SEEMING ADVANCES TOWARDS PEACE
AND MOST MEN REGARDING CHIEFLY THE ATROCIOUS USURPATION OF THE PRETENDED JUDGES AND THE MERIT OF THE VIRTUOUS PRINCE WHO SUFFERED WERE INCLINED TO CONDEMN THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE AS HIGHLY SEDITIOUS AND EXTRAVAGANT
AND AS THE MEN OF ESTATES AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE LEVIED AND ARMED THEIR TENANTS BESIDES AN ATTACHMENT TO THEIR MASTERS GREATER FORCE AND COURAGE WERE TO BE EXPECTED IN THESE RUSTIC TROOPS THAN IN THE VICIOUS AND ENERVATED POPULACE OF CITIES
ABOUT THE SAME TIME MANCHESTER WHO ADVANCED FROM THE EASTERN ASSOCIATED COUNTIES HAVING JOINED CROMWELL AND YOUNG FAIRFAX OBTAINED A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY OVER THE ROYALISTS AT HORNCASTLE
HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
THIS PARLIAMENT SAID THE PARTISANS OF THAT ASSEMBLY HAVE AT LENGTH PROFITED BY THE FATAL EXAMPLE OF THEIR PREDECESSORS
AND EVEN THE PERSONAL CHARACTER AND CONDUCT OF CROMWELL ESCAPED NOT WITHOUT CENSURE
THE LATTER WAS APPOINTED TO MARCH INTO THE WEST WHERE PRINCE MAURICE WITH A SMALL ARMY WHICH WENT CONTINUALLY TO DECAY WAS SPENDING HIS TIME IN VAIN BEFORE LYME AN INCONSIDERABLE TOWN UPON THE SEA-COAST
MASSEY RESOLUTE TO MAKE A VIGOROUS DEFENCE AND HAVING UNDER HIS COMMAND A CITY AND GARRISON AMBITIOUS OF THE CROWN OF MARTYRDOM HAD HITHERTO MAINTAINED THE SIEGE WITH COURAGE AND ABILITIES AND HAD MUCH RETARDED THE ADVANCES OF THE KING'S ARMY
THE ROYAL ARMY LAY NEAR BANBURY
AND THE KING'S FORCES THOUGH INFERIOR IN NUMBER GAVE A TOTAL DEFEAT TO THEIR ENEMIES
19
AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING THOUGH SOMEWHAT UNGRACEFULLY WAS AT LAST OBLIGED TO COMPLY AND IN THIS INCIDENT IT SUFFICIENTLY APPEARED THAT THE LORDS HOW LITTLE SOEVER INCLINED TO POPULAR COURSES WERE NOT WANTING IN A JUST SENSE OF THEIR OWN DIGNITY
THESE ARE THE CHIEF PERFORMANCES WHICH ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF POSTERITY
THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD AND DAILY SHARPENED THE HUMORS OF THE OPPOSITE PARTIES
1637 THE GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH THE ENGLISH LABORED WHEN CONSIDERED IN THEMSELVES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTION SCARCELY DESERVE THE NAME
MEANWHILE CROMWELL HAVING LED ON HIS TROOPS TO THE ATTACK OF LANGDALE OVERBORE THE FORCE OF THE ROYALISTS AND BY HIS PRUDENCE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WHICH HE HAD GAINED BY HIS VALOR
IN OPPOSITION TO THIS REASONING OF THE INDEPENDENTS MANY OF THE PRESBYTERIANS SHOWED THE INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER OF THE PROJECTED ALTERATION
THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WAR SHOULD BE GIVEN OVER ENTIRELY TO THE PARLIAMENT
TO THE OBNOXIOUS AND SOMETIMES TO THE INNOCENT THEY SOLD THEIR PROTECTION
DUNDALK WHERE MONK COMMANDED WAS DELIVERED UP BY THE TROOPS WHO MUTINIED AGAINST THEIR GOVERNOR
THE DUKE'S APPROBATION TOO WAS MENTIONED BY SECRETARY COKE
THE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE WHICH THE PARTY GAINED BY STRAFFORD'S DEATH MAY IN SOME DEGREE PALLIATE THE INIQUITY OF THE SENTENCE PRONOUNCED AGAINST HIM
AND HAVING ADDED TO THEIR OTHER FORCES THE TROOPS WHICH THEY HAD RECALLED FROM IRELAND THEY WERE READY ABOUT THE END OF THE YEAR TO ENTER ENGLAND UNDER THE COMMAND OF THEIR OLD GENERAL THE EARL OF LEVEN WITH AN ARMY OF ABOVE TWENTY THOUSAND MEN RUSH VOL
AS THE COVENANTERS IN THEIR BOND OF MUTUAL DEFENCE AGAINST ALL OPPOSITION HAD BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO EXCEPT THE KING CHARLES HAD FORMED A BOND WHICH WAS ANNEXED TO THIS RENUNCIATION AND WHICH EXPRESSED THE DUTY AND LOYALTY OF THE SUBSCRIBERS TO HIS MAJESTY BUT THE COVENANTERS PERCEIVING THAT THIS NEW COVENANT WAS ONLY MEANT TO WEAKEN AND DIVIDE THEM RECEIVED IT WITH THE UTMOST SCORN AND DETESTATION
AND HE ENTIRELY COMMANDED THEIR AFFECTIONATE REGARD BY HIS ABILITIES AND SUCCESS IN ALMOST EVERY ENTERPRISE WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO UNDERTAKEN
EVEN NEW IMPOSITIONS WERE LAID ON SEVERAL KINDS OF MERCHANDISE THE CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICERS RECEIVED ORDERS FROM THE COUNCIL TO ENTER INTO ANY HOUSE WAREHOUSE OR CELLAR
AND THEY THREATENED THE LAWYERS WITH A TOTAL ABROGATION OF THEIR PROFESSION
IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS HIGHLY PROBABLE THE KING AND THE DUKE THEMSELVES HAD HERE BEEN DECEIVED BY THE ARTIFICES OF FRANCE NOR HAD THEY ANY HOSTILE INTENTION AGAINST THE HUGONOTS
AND TO BOTH OF THESE NOTHING COULD APPEAR MORE EXCEPTIONABLE THAN THE COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION WHOSE INSTITUTION RENDERED IT ENTIRELY ARBITRARY AND ASSIGNED TO IT THE DEFENCE OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT
BECAUSE THEY SAID THE LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND THEIR CAPITAL ENEMY BEING GENERAL OF THE KING'S FORCES HAD THERE THE CHIEF COMMAND AND AUTHORITY
THE KING WAS SUFFICIENTLY APPRISED OF THIS DIFFICULTY
EIGHT WEEKS PAY ALONE THEY SAID WAS PROMISED
566 574 575
THE FRESH DIFFICULTIES WHICH AMIDST THE PRESENT DISTRESSES WERE EVERY DAY RAISED WITH REGARD TO THE PAYMENT OF SHIP MONEY OBLIGED HIM TO EXERT CONTINUAL ACTS OF AUTHORITY AUGMENTED THE DISCONTENTS OF THE PEOPLE AND INCREASED HIS INDIGENCE AND NECESSITIES.[V SEE NOTE E AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THE NATION WAS UNIVERSALLY AND HIGHLY DISCONTENTED
ALL ORDERS OF MEN WERE INFLAMED WITH INDIGNATION AT SEEING THE MILITARY PREVAIL OVER THE CIVIL POWER AND KING AND PARLIAMENT AT ONCE REDUCED TO SUBJECTION BY A MERCENARY ARMY
AT THE TIME WHEN THE OTHER OFFICERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMISSIONS CARE WAS TAKEN THAT HE SHOULD BE SENT WITH A BODY OF HORSE TO RELIEVE TAUNTON BESIEGED BY THE ROYALISTS
CHARLES ACCORDINGLY RESOLVED TO SUPPORT HIS AUTHORITY BY ARMS
MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM
BEING COMMONLY MEN OF BIRTH AND FORTUNE TO WHOM EXCESSES ARE LESS PERNICIOUS THAN TO THE VULGAR THEY WERE TOO APT TO INDULGE THEMSELVES IN ALL PLEASURES PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE TABLE

NO VISIBLE SECURITY WAS GIVEN FOR THE REMAINDER

BUT ACTUATED BY A VERY DIFFERENT SPIRIT
HENRY RICHARD'S BROTHER WHO GOVERNED IRELAND WITH POPULARITY INSURED HIM THE OBEDIENCE OF THAT KINGDOM
AND HE HAD SO FAR SUCCEEDED AS TO MAKE THEM DESIRE ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT WHICH MIGHT SECURE THEIR PROFESSIONS NOW BROUGHT IN DANGER BY THESE DESPERATE FANATICS
WITHOUT ONE MOMENT'S DELAY AND WITHOUT A CONTRADICTORY VOTE A COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED TO PREPARE AN ANSWER
BUT IT BEGAT IN THE KING SO HIGH AN IDEA OF HIS OWN RANK AND STATION AS MADE HIM INCAPABLE OF STOOPING TO POPULAR COURSES OR SUBMITTING IN ANY DEGREE TO THE CONTROL OF PARLIAMENT
LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR
215 216 ETC
THERE WAS NO POINT ABOUT WHICH THE PROTECTOR WAS MORE SOLICITOUS THAN TO PROCURE INTELLIGENCE
THE KING SHOCKED AT ALL THE INDIGNITIES AND PERHAPS STILL MORE TIRED WITH ALL THE FORMALITIES TO WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO SUBMIT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN HIS LIBERTY
SOME INSTANCES OF IMPERIOUS EXPRESSIONS AS WELL AS ACTIONS WERE GIVEN BY PYM
AND HE ORDERED A GUARD TO ATTEND THEM BUT WHILE THE KING WAS EMPLOYED IN PACIFYING THE COMMOTIONS IN SCOTLAND AND WAS PREPARING TO RETURN TO ENGLAND IN ORDER TO APPLY HIMSELF TO THE SAME SALUTARY WORK IN THAT KINGDOM HE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE OF A DANGEROUS REBELLION BROKEN BUT IN IRELAND WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE UTMOST HORROR BLOODSHED AND DEVASTATION
WHEN THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS OBTAINED THAT END FOR WHICH THEY SO EARNESTLY CONTENDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED BUT INDULGED STILL IN AN ARDENT PASSION FOR PROPAGATING BY ALL METHODS THAT MODE OF RELIGION IN THE NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS
AND FOR THEIR CONDUCT THEY WERE ACCOUNTABLE BY THE EXPRESS TERMS OF THE BILL NOT TO THE KING BUT TO THE PARLIAMENT
HAVING FIXED A CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE CITY AND ESTABLISHED ITS MILITIA IN HANDS WHOSE FIDELITY COULD BE RELIED ON HE RETURNED WITH HIS ARMY TO WESTMINSTER AND PURSUED EVERY PROPER MEASURE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION
AND HAD BY CONSEQUENCE EVERY MILITARY PREPARATION IN MUCH GREATER ORDER AND ABUNDANCE
THE KING SEEING A LARGE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE FIELD OPENED PRESSED THEM AGAIN FOR SUPPLY
THOUGH THEY AMOUNTED TO SUMS MUCH GREATER THAN THE NATION HAD FORMERLY PAID TO THE PUBLIC
IT MAY SAFELY BE AVERRED THAT THIS NEW EXTREME INTO WHICH THE KING FOR WANT OF PROPER COUNSEL OR SUPPORT WAS FALLEN BECAME NO LESS DANGEROUS TO THE CONSTITUTION AND PERNICIOUS TO PUBLIC PEACE THAN THE OTHER IN WHICH HE HAD SO LONG AND SO UNFORTUNATELY PERSEVERED
THE HANGMAN THEN TOOK OFF THE HAT OF THE NOBLE PRISONER AND RODE HIMSELF BEFORE THE CART IN HIS LIVERY AND WITH HIS BONNET ON
BY TEARING UP THE ROOTS OF ALL PROPERTY THEY HAVE TAKEN FROM US EVERY MEANS OF SUPPLYING THE KING AND OF INGRATIATING OURSELVES BY VOLUNTARY PROOFS OF OUR DUTY AND ATTACHMENT TOWARDS HIM
SAMSON'S HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF BEFORE HIS COURAGE CAN BE ANY JOT ABATED
THE LITURGY WHICH THE KING FROM HIS OWN AUTHORITY IMPOSED ON SCOTLAND WAS COPIED FROM THAT OF ENGLAND
A PROJECT USEFUL HONORABLE NAY INDISPENSABLY REQUISITE AND IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT NECESSITIES BROUGHT ALMOST TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION
BUT PRESERVED THE GREATEST ORDER DECENCY AND APPEARANCE OF HUMILITY
AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THAT PARLIAMENT FOLLOWED SO SOON AFTER THAT NO ATTEMPT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR OBTAINING TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE IN ANY OTHER FORM 3 6 HENRY VIII
WITH THIS ARMY THE KING LEFT SHREWSBURY RESOLVING TO GIVE BATTLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE ARMY OF THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HE HEARD WAS CONTINUALLY AUGMENTING BY SUPPLIES FROM LONDON
AND TO THE DISGRACE OF THAT AGE AND OF THIS ISLAND IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE DISORDERS IN SCOTLAND ENTIRELY AND THOSE IN ENGLAND MOSTLY PROCEEDED FROM SO MEAN AND CONTEMPTIBLE AN ORIGIN CLARENDON VOL
BUT THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS INSTITUTED TO CHECK AND CONTROL THE KING AND SHARE THE SUPREME POWER WOULD IN ALL FORMER TIMES HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED VERY BLUNT AND INDISCREET IF NOT ILLEGAL LANGUAGE
AND AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD HAVE SETTLED THE NATION THEY PROFESSED THEIR INTENTION OF RESTORING THE POWER TO THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THEY HAD ENTIRELY DERIVED IT
THE CITY OF LONDON ON THE OTHER HAND AND MOST OF THE GREAT CORPORATIONS TOOK PART WITH THE PARLIAMENT AND ADOPTED WITH ZEAL THOSE DEMOCRATICAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE PRETENSIONS OF THAT ASSEMBLY WERE FOUNDED
I HAVE SOUGHT THE LORD NIGHT AND DAY THAT HE WOULD RATHER SLAY ME THAN PUT ME UPON THIS WORK HAVING COMMANDED THE SOLDIERS TO CLEAR THE HALL HE HIMSELF WENT OUT THE LAST AND ORDERING THE DOORS TO BE LOCKED DEPARTED TO HIS LODGINGS IN WHITEHALL
THOUGH IRETON MADE STOUT RESISTANCE AND EVEN AFTER HE WAS RUN THROUGH THE THIGH WITH A PIKE STILL MAINTAINED THE COMBAT TILL HE WAS TAKEN PRISONER YET WAS THAT WHOLE WING BROKEN AND PURSUED WITH PRECIPITATE FURY BY RUPERT
THE PARLIAMENT EVEN COMPLIED WITH SO VIOLENT A DEMAND AND PASSED A VOTE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE ARMY BY THIS UNLIMITED PATIENCE THEY PURPOSED TO TEMPORIZE UNDER THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES AND THEY HOPED TO FIND A MORE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR RECOVERING THEIR AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE
AND HEARING THAT THE PARLIAMENT LAID CLAIM TO THE ENTIRE DISPOSAL OF THE KING'S PERSON AND THAT THE ENGLISH ARMY WAS MAKING SOME MOTION TOWARDS THEM THEY THOUGHT PROPER TO RETIRE NORTHWARDS AND TO FIX THEIR CAMP AT NEWCASTLE RUSH VOL
MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS IN HIS EXPENSE
TO RAISE THE IRISH TO ARMS I SUPPOSE AND BRING THEM OVER TO ENGLAND FOR HIS ASSISTANCE
AND IF THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY OBTAINED SUCH ADVANTAGES SAVOR OFTEN OF ARTIFICE SOMETIMES OF VIOLENCE IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT REVOLUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE EFFECTED BY THE MERE FORCE OF ARGUMENT AND REASONING
WHAT PRETENSIONS WOULD BE ADVANCED HOW UNPRECEDENTED HOW UNLIMITED WERE EASILY IMAGINED
THAT HE JAMES GRAHAM FOR THIS WAS THE ONLY NAME THEY VOUCHSAFED TO GIVE HIM SHOULD NEXT DAY BE CARRIED TO EDINBURGH CROSS AND THERE BE HANGED ON A GIBBET THIRTY FEET HIGH FOR THE SPACE OF THREE HOURS
YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON
FOR ADDS THE KING WE DO HEREBY ASSURE YOU THAT IT SHALL BE STILL ONE OF OUR CHIEFEST STUDIES HOW TO RECTIFY AND ESTABLISH THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT CHURCH ARIGHT AND TO REPAIR YOUR LOSSES WHICH WE DESIRE YOU TO BE MOST CONFIDENT OF AND IN ANOTHER PLACE YOU MAY REST SECURE THAT THOUGH PERHAPS WE MAY GIVE WAY FOR THE PRESENT TO THAT WHICH WILL BE PREJUDICIAL BOTH TO THE CHURCH AND OUR OWN GOVERNMENT YET WE SHALL NOT LEAVE THINKING IN TIME HOW TO REMEDY BOTH BUT DOES THE KING SAY THAT HE WILL ARBITRARILY REVOKE HIS CONCESSIONS
THEIR TENETS CANVASSED
A MAN AS MUCH HATED BY ONE PARTY AS RESPECTED BY THE OTHER
THAT HE HAD SO FAR SUITED HIS FIRST DEMANDS TO THEIR PREJUDICES THAT HE ONLY ASKED A SUPPLY FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WAS WILLING AFTER SO SHORT A TRUST FROM THEM TO FALL AGAIN INTO DEPENDENCE AND TO TRUST THEM FOR HIS FURTHER SUPPORT AND SUBSISTENCE
THE COMMONS SHOWED LITTLE BETTER DISPOSITION TOWARDS COLEPEPER AND UVEDALE BOTH HOUSES REPLIED THAT THEY COULD ADMIT OF NO TREATY WITH THE KING TILL HE TOOK DOWN HIS STANDARD AND RECALLED HIS PROCLAMATIONS IN WHICH THE PARLIAMENT SUPPOSED THEMSELVES TO BE DECLARED TRAITORS
AND THEY MARCHED TO THE BORDERS OF ENGLAND
14 BURNET'S MEM
IN PROPORTION TO THEIR FORMER DELUSIONS WHICH HAD ANIMATED THEM AGAINST HIM WAS THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR RETURN TO DUTY AND AFFECTION
BUT THE ROYALISTS BEING REENFORCED WITH THREE THOUSAND HORSE UNDER GORING AGAIN ADVANCED TO TAUNTON AND SHUT UP WELDON WITH HIS SMALL ARMY IN THAT RUINOUS PLACE THE KING HAVING EFFECTED HIS PURPOSE WITH REGARD TO CHESTER RETURNED SOUTHWARDS
ORMOND HAD THROWN INTO IT A GOOD GARRISON OF THREE THOUSAND MEN UNDER SIR ARTHUR ASTON AN OFFICER OF REPUTATION
528
AND THAT A METHOD OF ADDRESS WAS ADOPTED NOT ONLY UNSUITABLE TOWARDS SO GREAT A PRINCE BUT WHICH NO PRIVATE GENTLEMAN COULD BEAR WITHOUT RESENTMENT
THEY WERE SUCH AS A CAPTIVE ENTIRELY AT MERCY COULD EXPECT FROM THE MOST INEXORABLE VICTOR
IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS
269
THE SPECIAL COMMAND ALONE OF THE KING AND COUNCIL WAS PLEADED
BUT UPON SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED FELL OFF FROM THAT DESIGN
THESE ACTS OF AUTHORITY WERE INTERPRETED WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF REASON TO BE INVASIONS ON THE RIGHT OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES BUT THE KING AFTER THE FIRST PROVOCATION WHICH HE MET WITH NEVER SUFFICIENTLY RESPECTED THE PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT
AND THAT AS THEY WERE NOT YET DAUNTED BY ANY ILL SUCCESS NO REASONABLE TERMS COULD BE EXPECTED FROM THEM
PAGE 639
14 FOOTNOTE 3
THE LORD LIEUTENANT THOUGH SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES NEGLECTED NOT THE FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF PROMOTING THE ROYAL CAUSE
THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND THOUGH AN IMMENSE BODY AND POSSESSED OF THE GREATER PART OF NATIONAL PROPERTY WERE NATURALLY SOMEWHAT DEFENCELESS BECAUSE OF THEIR PERSONAL EQUALITY AND THEIR WANT OF LEADERS
BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SENSIBLE THAT TILL PROVIDED WITH A SUFFICIENT MILITARY FORCE ALL HIS ATTEMPTS IN OPPOSITION TO THE RISING SPIRIT OF THE NATION MUST IN THE END PROVE WHOLLY FRUITLESS
THESE VISITATIONS THEY ASCRIBED TO THE MANIFOLD PROVOCATIONS OF THE KING'S HOUSE OF WHICH THEY FEARED HE HAD NOT YET THOROUGHLY REPENTED
AND CHARLES HAD SUPPLIED THEIR PLACE BY OTHERS BETTER AFFECTED TO HIS SERVICE
WHEN THEY MET FOR DIVINE WORSHIP EACH ROSE UP IN HIS PLACE AND DELIVERED THE EXTEMPORARY INSPIRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST
AND THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE AS WELL AS ENTERTAINING TO A PHILOSOPHICAL MIND
AND BEING REFUSED HIS PARDON THE MELANCHOLY OF HER TEMPER INCREASED BY HER DISTEMPERED BODY HAD PROMPTED HER TO LAMENT TO HER FATHER ALL HIS SANGUINARY MEASURES AND URGE HIM TO COMPUNCTION FOR THOSE HEINOUS CRIMES INTO WHICH HIS FATAL AMBITION HAD BETRAYED HIM
THE BIGOTS WERE ENRAGED AGAINST THE PRELATICAL CLERGY
IN THEIR SAFETY IS INVOLVED THE SECURITY OF THE LAWS
REMEMBER HIS MAJESTY'S ADMONITION
YET IN ORDER TO GRATIFY HIS PRIVATE PASSIONS HE HAD HURRIED HIS MASTER AND HIS COUNTRY INTO A WAR PERNICIOUS TO THE INTERESTS OF BOTH
8 38
THE KING'S NEARER APPROACH TO COLEBROKE QUICKENED THEIR ADVANCES FOR PEACE
THIS ARTICLE ALONE IT IS SAID COST HIM SIXTY THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR
AND EACH COUNTY WAS RATED AT A PARTICULAR SUM WHICH WAS AFTER WARDS ASSESSED UPON INDIVIDUALS THE AMOUNT OF THE WHOLE TAX WAS VERY MODERATE LITTLE EXCEEDING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
THESE MEN HAD NOT THAT LARGE THOUGHT NOR THOSE COMPREHENSIVE VIEWS WHICH MIGHT QUALIFY THEM FOR ACTING THE PART OF LEGISLATORS
IT IS NOW SO UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED NOTWITHSTANDING SOME MUTTERING TO THE CONTRARY THAT THE KING HAD NO HAND IN THE IRISH REBELLION THAT IT WILL BE SUPERFLUOUS TO INSIST ON A POINT WHICH SEEMS SO CLEAR
AND THEREUPON SAT STILL ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
THESE MEN ASSISTED BY COMMISSIONERS HAD POWER TO SUBJECT WHOM THEY PLEASED TO DECIMATION TO LEVY ALL THE TAXES IMPOSED BY THE PROTECTOR AND HIS COUNCIL AND TO IMPRISON ANY PERSON WHO SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THEIR JEALOUSY OR SUSPICION
IT IS CONFESSED THAT THE KING'S BEHAVIOR DURING THIS LAST SCENE OF HIS LIFE DOES HONOR TO HIS MEMORY
740
LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE
A MILITARY ENTERPRISE WHICH THEY HAD CONCERTED EARLY IN THE SPRING WAS IMMEDIATELY UNDERTAKEN
AND THAT THE EARL HAD NO TITLE TO PLEAD LAW BECAUSE HE HAD BROKEN THE LAW
SO LONG HAD THE INACCURACY CONTINUED WITHOUT BEING REMARKED OR CORRECTED
147 ET SEQ
AND BY HIS INGENIOUS TALENT FOR RIDICULE HE HAD RENDERED HIMSELF EXTREMELY AGREEABLE TO HIS MASTER
THESE WERE THE SORCERERS
THE SENTENCE AGAINST HAMBDEN CANCELLED
AND ONE OF THEM BRAVELY PERISHED IN THE EXPERIMENT A FEMALE QUAKER CAME NAKED INTO THE CHURCH WHERE THE PROTECTOR SAT
233 SAYS THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY WERE NOT AGREED ABOUT THE ENTIRE ABOLITION OF EPISCOPACY
AND THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE JURISDICTION OF THAT OTHER HOUSE WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED
THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY FELL INTO THE SNARE
HAVING IN VAIN WANDERED ABOUT FOR SOME TIME THEY WERE TOTALLY DISCOURAGED
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE SUCCESSES EVEN THE MOST COMMON NECESSARIES OF LIFE WERE WANTING TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMIES
AND EVEN HIS USUAL ATTENTION TO DRESS REQUIRED BY HIS BIRTH AND STATION GAVE WAY TO A NEGLIGENCE WHICH WAS EASILY OBSERVABLE
AND AFTER SOME PRELIMINARY CONVERSATION THE DOCTOR OPENS HIS BUSINESS
540
FEELING A STRONGER IMPULSE TOWARDS SPIRITUAL CONTEMPLATIONS THAN TOWARDS THAT MECHANICAL PROFESSION HE LEFT HIS MASTER AND WENT ABOUT THE COUNTRY CLOTHED IN A LEATHERN DOUBLET A DRESS WHICH HE LONG AFFECTED AS WELL FOR ITS SINGULARITY AS ITS CHEAPNESS
PRINCE MAURICE ON ANOTHER
THE COURAGE OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS INCREASED BESIDES THEIR GREAT SUPERIORITY OF FORCE BY TWO RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD HAPPENED IN THEIR FAVOR
WHEN CIVIL CONVULSIONS PROCEEDED TO EXTREMITIES AND IT BECAME REQUISITE FOR HIM TO CHOOSE HIS SIDE HE TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF HIS ZEAL AND EMBRACED THE DEFENCE OF THOSE LIMITED POWERS WHICH REMAINED TO MONARCHY AND WHICH HE DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
BUT CROMWELL KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF DESPATCH
THE FIRST WRITS OF THIS KIND HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO SEAPORT TOWNS ONLY
THESE PRESENTED TO ALL LIVINGS WHICH WERE FORMERLY IN THE GIFT OF THE CROWN
NO ENGLISH FLEET EXCEPT DURING THE CRUSADES HAD EVER BEFORE SAILED IN THOSE SEAS
TO CROMWELL CHAPTER L
AND WAS NOW EXTENDED OVER PROVISIONS AND THE COMMON NECESSARIES OF LIFE
THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER WAS TO BE TAUGHT SOME OTHER MECHANICAL EMPLOYMENT
IN THE MEMOIRS OF LORD BROGHILL WE MEET WITH ANOTHER STORY OF AN INTERCEPTED LETTER WHICH DESERVES SOME MORE ATTENTION AND AGREES VERY WELL WITH THE NARRATION HERE GIVEN
HE IT WAS WHO BEING SPEAKER IN THE KING'S THIRD PARLIAMENT HAD LEFT THE CHAIR AND REFUSED TO PUT THE QUESTION WHEN ORDERED BY THE HOUSE
SIR GEORGE MARKHAM FOLLOWING A CHASE WHERE LORD DARCY'S HUNTSMAN WAS EXERCISING HIS HOUNDS KEPT CLOSER TO THE DOGS THAN WAS THOUGHT PROPER BY THE HUNTSMAN WHO BESIDES OTHER RUDENESS GAVE HIM FOUL LANGUAGE WHICH SIR GEORGE RETURNED WITH A STROKE OF HIS WHIP
168 169 170 ETC
WHICH AMOUNTED NOT TO ABOVE HALF OF THE OTHER HOUSE OF COMMONS RUSH
HIS DESIRE HOWEVER OF FINISHING AN ACCOMMODATION INDUCED HIM TO GO AS FAR IN BOTH THESE PARTICULARS AS HE THOUGHT ANY WISE CONSISTENT WITH HIS DUTY
THE KING THAT HE MIGHT MAKE PREPARATIONS DURING WINTER FOR THE ENSUING CAMPAIGN SUMMONED TO OXFORD ALL THE MEMBERS OF EITHER HOUSE WHO ADHERED TO HIS INTERESTS
CROMWELL SAYS CLEVELAND HATH BEAT UP HIS DRUMS CLEAN THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT
PHILIP WAS NOT THEIR SOVEREIGN
AND IN CASE OF A VACANCY THE REMAINING MEMBERS NAMED THREE OF WHOM THE PROTECTOR CHOSE ONE
AND THE ARGUMENT THAT PREVAILED WITH ME WAS THAT THE CALLING DID NO WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE THEM TO BE A PARLIAMENT
92
NONE OF HIS ENGLISH FRIENDS WHO HAD SERVED HIS FATHER WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THE KINGDOM
BUT TO SHOW HOW LITTLE THEY WERE DISCOURAGED THE PURITANS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IN ANOTHER BILL FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF EPISCOPACY
BUT THIS WHOLE MATTER THOUGH VERY INNOCENT WAS MOST CAREFULLY KEPT SECRET
AND AN INCIDENT HAD HAPPENED WHICH HE BELIEVED HAD NOW FURNISHED HIM WITH STILL MORE COGENT ARGUMENTS
STONES WERE THROWN AT THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
AND OF ALL ACTIONS TO RID THE WORLD OF THESE DECLARED ENEMIES TO CATHOLIC FAITH AND PIETY WAS REPRESENTED AS THE MOST MERITORIOUS.[V NATURE WHICH IN THAT RUDE PEOPLE WAS SUFFICIENTLY INCLINED TO ATROCIOUS DEEDS WAS FURTHER STIMULATED BY PRECEPT
BUT HOWEVER WEAK MONTROSE'S ARMY THE MEMORY OF PAST EVENTS STRUCK A GREAT TERROR INTO THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES
AND VERY FEW HOURS WERE ALLOWED HIM TO DELIBERATE UPON THE EXECUTION OF THESE VIOLENT ORDERS
THE COVENANTERS BEING AFRAID OF DRIVING HIM BY THEIR RIGORS TO SOME DESPERATE RESOLUTION
THAT NO LESS A SUM THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR HAD BEEN FOUND BY COMPUTATION REQUISITE FOR ALL THESE PURPOSES
AS FULL OF KEEN SATIRE AND INVECTIVE IN HIS ELOQUENCE AS OF TENDERNESS AND PANEGYRIC IN HIS POETRY HE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF HIS HEARERS AND EXERTED THE UTMOST BOLDNESS IN BLAMING THOSE VIOLENT COUNSELS BY WHICH THE COMMONS WERE GOVERNED
BUT A SYSTEM WHETHER PHYSICAL OR METAPHYSICAL COMMONLY OWES ITS SUCCESS TO ITS NOVELTY
THE PARLIAMENT WAS SO OVERAWED THAT THEY DECLARED THE SCOTS TO BE ENEMIES AND ALL WHO JOINED THEM TRAITORS
AND HERE I SHOULD PUT OUT MY FOURTH LIGHT ETC
THEY IMMEDIATELY DESPATCHED PAW PENSIONARY OF HOLLAND AS THEIR AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY TO LONDON AND ORDERED HIM TO LAY BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT THE NARRATIVE WHICH TROMP HAD SENT OF THE LATE RENCOUNTER
710
NOT ONLY HE HAD SERVED THEM ALL ALONG WITH THE MOST EXACT AND SCRUPULOUS HONOR
HE WAS REMARKABLE FOR HIS MODERATION IN PARTY
THE LORD KEEPERS WILLIAMS BISHOP OF LINCOLN LORD COVENTRY LORD FINCH LORD LITTLETON AND SIR RICHARD LANE
AND WHENCE DO ALL LEGISLATURES DERIVE THEIR RIGHT BUT FROM LONG CUSTOM AND ESTABLISHED PRACTICE
THE SECLUDED MEMBERS HAVING PUBLISHED A PAPER CONTAINING A NARRATIVE OF THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAD BEEN EXERCISED UPON THEM AND A PROTESTATION THAT ALL ACTS WERE VOID WHICH FROM THAT TIME HAD BEEN TRANSACTED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS THE REMAINING MEMBERS ENCOUNTERED IT WITH A DECLARATION IN WHICH THEY PRONOUNCED IT FALSE SCANDALOUS SEDITIOUS AND TENDING TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VISIBLE AND FUNDAMENTAL GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM
NO NEW CRIME HAD SINCE BEEN DISCOVERED
CHAPTER LXI
BUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE COMMONS WERE WIDE OF THIS PURPOSE AND THEIR PANICS COULD BE CURED BY ONE REMEDY ALONE
HIS ARMY UPON THIS DISASTER GAVE GROUND APACE
AND ON THE DAY OF APPEARANCE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY WOMEN WITH GOOD CLUBS IN THEIR HANDS CAME AND BESIEGED THE CHURCH WHERE THE REVEREND MINISTERS SAT
BUT MARK WHAT I SAY
09
AND WHETHER THE PRINCE FROM SUCH VIOLENT ATTEMPTS AND PRETENSIONS AS HE HAD EXPERIENCED HAD NOT AT LEAST AS GREAT REASON TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSIONS FOR HIS AUTHORITY AS THEY FOR THEIR LIBERTY
AND SUPPORTED WITH ALL STRANGERS THAT HIGH IDEA WITH WHICH HIS GREAT EXPLOITS AND PRODIGIOUS FORTUNE HAD IMPRESSED THEM
CHARLES FOLLOWED THESE DIRECTIONS AND VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED TO BREDA
IN ORDER TO ELUDE THESE NUMEROUS ARMIES HE TURNED ASIDE INTO THE HILLS AND SAVED HIS WEAK BUT ACTIVE TROOPS IN BADENOCH
AFTER THERE HAD BEEN A NEW NEGOTIATION ENTERED INTO BETWEEN GLAMORGAN AND THE IRISH AND AFTER A PROVISIONAL TREATY HAD EVEN BEEN CONCLUDED BETWEEN THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ADVANTAGES THE EXTREME WANT BOTH OF MONEY AND AMMUNITION UNDER WHICH THE CORNISH ROYALISTS LABORED OBLIGED THEM TO ENTER INTO A CONVENTION OF NEUTRALITY WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY PARTY IN DEVONSHIRE
THE ANTINOMIANS EVEN INSISTED THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF MORALITY AND NATURAL LAW WERE SUSPENDED AND THAT THE ELECT GUIDED BY AN INTERNAL PRINCIPLE MORE PERFECT AND DIVINE WERE SUPERIOR TO THE BEGGARLY ELEMENTS OF JUSTICE AND HUMANITY
HE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED
25 EDW
LILBURNE LEIGHTON AND EVERY ONE THAT HAD BEEN PUNISHED FOR SEDITIOUS LIBELS DURING THE PRECEDING ADMINISTRATION NOW RECOVERED THEIR LIBERTY AND WERE DECREED DAMAGES FROM THE JUDGES AND MINISTERS OF JUSTICE NOT ONLY THE PRESENT DISPOSITION OF THE NATION INSURED IMPUNITY TO ALL LIBELLERS
THIS SENTENCE WHICH WAS CERTAINLY HARD BUT WHICH OUGHT TO SAVE HIS MEMORY FROM ALL IMPUTATIONS OF TREACHERY TO HIS MASTER WAS EXECUTED ON A SCAFFOLD ERECTED BEFORE WESTMINSTER HALL
AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THE EXAMPLE OF SUCH NEIGHBORS AS WELL AS THEIR ASSISTANCE MIGHT SOME TIME BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO ENGLAND AND ENCOURAGE HER TO RECOVER BY A VIGOROUS EFFORT HER VIOLATED LAWS AND LIBERTIES
THE ENDEAVORS TO REGAIN THE GOOD WILL OF THE NATION WERE CARRIED SO FAR BY THE KING OF SPAIN THAT HE GENEROUSLY RELEASED AND SENT HOME ALL THE ENGLISH PRISONERS TAKEN IN THE EXPEDITION AGAINST CADIZ
THE WHOLE REVENUE OF THE PUBLIC DURING THE PROTECTORSHIP OF RICHARD WAS ESTIMATED AT ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN POUNDS
567 633 VOL
THAT AN INSURRECTION HAD BEEN AT THAT TIME WANTONLY AND VOLUNTARILY FORMED BY THEIR LEADERS WHO BEING DISGUSTED IN SOME COURT INTRIGUE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE NEVER FAILING PRETENCE OF RELIGION IN ORDER TO COVER THEIR REBELLION THAT THE DUTCH INFLUENCED BY THESE VIEWS HAD ORDERED A SQUADRON OF TWENTY SHIPS TO JOIN THE FRENCH FLEET EMPLOYED AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE THAT THE SPANISH MONARCH SENSIBLE OF THE SAME CONSEQUENCES SECRETLY SUPPORTED THE PROTESTANTS IN FRANCE
ON THEIR REPORT A VOTE PASSED DECLARING IT TREASON IN A KING TO LEVY WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT AND APPOINTING A HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE TO TRY CHARLES FOR THIS NEW-INVENTED TREASON
AND THOUGHT THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE ENTITLED TO SHARE AMONG THEM THOSE OFFICES AND RICHES OF WHICH ITS MEMBERS HAD SO LONG KEPT POSSESSION
474 475
SOMETIMES A GREAT MANY PREACHERS WERE MOVED TO SPEAK AT ONCE SOMETIMES A TOTAL SILENCE PREVAILED IN THEIR CONGREGATIONS
NOR WAS IT SAFE FOR ANY MEMBER TO APPROACH EITHER HOUSE WHO PRETENDED TO CONTROL OR OPPOSE THE GENERAL TORRENT
PERHAPS THE KING THOUGHT IT LITTLE FOR HIS CREDIT TO BE TREPANNED INTO THIS MEASURE AND WAS MORE WILLING TO TAKE IT ON HIMSELF AS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY
SO DIFFICULT WAS IT NOTWITHSTANDING THE BLINDNESS OF PREJUDICE AND THE ALLUREMENTS OF INTEREST TO ENGAGE MEN OF ANY NAME OR CHARACTER IN THAT CRIMINAL MEASURE
WHEN ANY OF THE LORDS PASSED THE CRY FOR JUSTICE AGAINST STRAFFORD RESOUNDED IN THEIR EARS
CROMWELL FEARED NOT TO OPPOSE EIGHT THOUSAND MEN TO THE NUMEROUS ARMIES OF TWENTY THOUSAND COMMANDED BY HAMILTON AND LANGDALE
WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS
AND HE FAILED NOT FROM TIME TO TIME TO INFORM THE PARLIAMENT THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RELIEVED HE SHOULD BE NECESSITATED FROM THE EXTREME WANT OF PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION TO OPEN HIS GATES TO THE ENEMY
HE SAW WITH HOW MUCH GREATER FACILITY THEY COULD NOW COLLECT FORCES WHICH HAD BEEN VERY LATELY DISBANDED AND WHICH HAD BEEN SO LONG INURED TO MILITARY DISCIPLINE
THE DUTCH ADMIRAL MADE A SKILFUL RETREAT AND SAVED ALL THE MERCHANT SHIPS EXCEPT THIRTY
AND THE KING'S HONOR LAY RATHER IN SHOWING SOME EARLY SYMPTOMS OF COURAGE AND ACTIVITY THAN IN CHOOSING STRICTLY A PARTY AMONG THEOLOGICAL CONTROVERSIES WITH WHICH IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED HE WAS AS YET VERY LITTLE ACQUAINTED
WHILE HE WAS COLLECTING AN ARMY OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEN IN THE WEST OF ENGLAND HE SENT TO IRELAND UNDER REYNOLDS AND VENABLES A REENFORCEMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND HORSE AND FOOT IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN JONES AND ENABLE HIM TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND WHO LAY AT FINGLASS AND WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR THE ATTACK OF DUBLIN
AND THAT AFTER TAKING ARMS WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION AGAINST THEIR SOVEREIGN WHO HAD EVER LOVED AND CHERISHED THEM THEY HAD DESERVEDLY FALLEN INTO A SITUATION FROM WHICH THEY COULD NOT EXTRICATE THEMSELVES WITHOUT EITHER INFAMY OR IMPRUDENCE
2 FOR THIS UNUSUAL MEASURE OF THE COMMONS IS THAT THEY INTENDED TO DEPRIVE THE CROWN OF THE PREROGATIVE WHICH IT HAD ASSUMED OF VARYING THE RATES OF THE IMPOSITIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME WERE RESOLVED TO CUT OFF THE NEW RATES FIXED BY JAMES
IT WAS THEREFORE A LAW DESERVING APPROBATION THAT NO MAN SHOULD BE CREATED A SCOTCH PEER WHO POSSESSED NOT TEN THOUSAND MARKS ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS OF ANNUAL RENT IN THE KINGDOM A LAW FOR TRIENNIAL PARLIAMENTS WAS LIKEWISE PASSED
IN ORDER TO CLOSE THIS PART OF BRITISH HISTORY IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO RELATE THE DISSOLUTION OF THE MONARCHY IN ENGLAND
BARK A COUNTERPART AS IT WERE A KENNEL OF DOGS
HAVING FIRST ESTABLISHED A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS NOBLE IN ITSELF AND SEEMS SPECIOUS BUT IS BELIED BY ALL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE THE ORIGIN OF ALL JUST POWER THEY NEXT DECLARED THAT THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT BEING CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE AND REPRESENTING THEM ARE THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF THE NATION AND THAT WHATEVER IS ENACTED AND DECLARED TO BE LAW BY THE COMMONS HATH THE FORCE OF LAW WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF KING OR HOUSE OF PEERS
388
THE PRESENCE OF THEIR ARMY REDUCED THE KING TO THAT TOTAL SUBJECTION IN WHICH HE WAS NOW HELD
ACCOMPANIED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES THE MOST DETESTABLE OF WHICH THERE EVER WAS ANY RECORD
SEE PARL
THEY ELECTED A COMMITTEE OF TWENTY-THREE PERSONS OF WHOM SEVEN WERE OFFICERS
AND ALL THE FINE ARTS WHICH MINISTER TO RELIGION THEREBY RECEIVED ADDITIONAL ENCOURAGEMENT
THE LEGALITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS MET WITH MANY AND JUST APOLOGIES THOUGH GENERALLY OFFERED TO UNWILLING EARS
VAN GALEN WITH MUCH SUPERIOR FORCE ATTACKED CAPTAIN BADILY AND DEFEATED HIM
BUT DID HE SAY SO
AND INVITED HIM TO RESIDE AT RICHMOND AND CONTRIBUTE HIS ASSISTANCE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NATION
IT MAY BE AFFIRMED WITHOUT ANY EXAGGERATION THAT THE KING'S ASSENT TO THE PETITION OF RIGHT PRODUCED SUCH A CHANGE IN THE GOVERNMENT AS WAS ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO A REVOLUTION
THE THOROUGH-PACED PURITANS WERE DISTINGUISHABLE BY THE SOURNESS AND AUSTERITY OF THEIR MANNERS AND BY THEIR AVERSION TO ALL PLEASURE AND SOCIETY TO INSPIRE THEM WITH BETTER HUMOR WAS CERTAINLY BOTH FOR THEIR OWN SAKE AND THAT OF THE PUBLIC A LAUDABLE INTENTION IN THE COURT
281
281
281
THE BILLS WHICH THEY PASSED WERE TO BE PRESENTED TO THE PROTECTOR FOR HIS ASSENT
AND BESOUGHT THE LORD THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS OWN WORK INTO HIS OWN HAND
THAT EVEN RETAINING THE EXPRESSION THIS KINGDOM THE WORDS MAY FAIRLY BE UNDERSTOOD OF SCOTLAND WHICH ALONE WAS THE KINGDOM THAT THE DEBATE REGARDED AND WHICH ALONE HAD THROWN OFF ALLEGIANCE AND COULD BE REDUCED TO OBEDIENCE
THAT IT WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT THE SAME NATIONAL SPIRIT ASSISTED BY HAMILTON AND HIS PARTY WOULD RISE STILL HIGHER IN FAVOR OF THEIR PRINCE AFTER HE HAD INTRUSTED HIMSELF TO THEIR FIDELITY AND WOULD MUCH ABATE THE RIGOR OF THE CONDITIONS NOW IMPOSED UPON HIM
BUT ALL THE PLEASURE WHICH CHARLES REAPED FROM THIS JOYOUS RECEPTION WAS SOON DAMPED BY THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE COMMONS WHICH WAS PRESENTED HIM TOGETHER WITH A PETITION OF A LIKE STRAIN
V THURLOE VOL
V THURLOE VOL
V THURLOE VOL
V THURLOE VOL
BUT REFUSING TO ANSWER BEFORE AN INFERIOR COURT FOR THEIR CONDUCT AS MEMBERS OF A SUPERIOR THEY WERE CONDEMNED TO BE IMPRISONED DURING THE KING'S PLEASURE TO FIND SURETIES FOR THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND TO BE FINED THE TWO FORMER A THOUSAND POUNDS APIECE THE LATTER FIVE HUNDRED THIS SENTENCE PROCURED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE CROWN SERVED ONLY TO SHOW THE KING'S DISREGARD TO THE PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT AND TO ACQUIRE AN IMMENSE STOCK OF POPULARITY TO THE SUFFERERS WHO HAD SO BRAVELY IN OPPOSITION TO ARBITRARY POWER DEFENDED THE LIBERTIES OF THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY
THE EPITHET OF THE IGNORANT AND VICIOUS PRIESTHOOD WAS COMMONLY APPLIED TO ALL CHURCHMEN ADDICTED TO THE ESTABLISHED DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
POLITE AND ELEGANT IN HIS TASTE
AFTER THE KING WAS SUBDUED BREAD AND FLESH-MEAT WERE EXEMPTED FROM EXCISE
BUT THIS EXPEDIENT SERVED RATHER TO INVOLVE HIM IN FURTHER DEBTS AND DIFFICULTIES
THE PEOPLE THOUGH UNDER THE ROD OF LAWLESS UNLIMITED POWER COULD NOT FORBEAR WITH THE MOST ARDENT PRAYERS POURING FORTH THEIR WISHES FOR HIS PRESERVATION
THE TWO BROTHERS HAMILTON AND LANERIC WERE LEADERS OF THIS PARTY
AND ON HIS REFUSAL TO DELIVER THEM HE WAS SENT TO THE TOWER
ON THE CONTRARY THEY OFFERED THEIR MEDIATION FOR COMPOSING THESE INTESTINE DISORDERS
IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE ROCHELLE OF ALL SUCCOR HE HAD DARED TO PROJECT THE THROWING ACROSS THE HARBOR A MOLE OF A MILE'S EXTENT IN THAT BOISTEROUS OCEAN
THOUGH ONE VISOR FELL OFF ANOTHER STILL REMAINED TO COVER HIS NATURAL COUNTENANCE
SOME MEN ALSO THERE WERE OF LIBERAL EDUCATION WHO BEING EITHER CARELESS OR IGNORANT OF THOSE DISPUTES BANDIED ABOUT BY THE CLERGY OF BOTH SIDES ASPIRED TO NOTHING BUT AN EASY ENJOYMENT OF LIFE AMIDST THE JOVIAL ENTERTAINMENT AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE OF THEIR COMPANIONS
THE ROYALISTS CONSISTING OF THE NOBLES AND MORE CONSIDERABLE GENTRY BEING DEGRADED FROM THEIR AUTHORITY AND PLUNDERED OF THEIR PROPERTY WERE INFLAMED WITH THE HIGHEST RESENTMENT AND INDIGNATION AGAINST THOSE IGNOBLE ADVERSARIES WHO HAD REDUCED THEM TO SUBJECTION
EDS INTENDED MIGRATION TO AMERICA WHERE HE COULD ONLY PROPOSE THE ADVANTAGE OF ENJOYING PURITANICAL PRAYERS AND SERMONS WILL BE ALLOWED A PROOF OF THE PREVALENCE OF THIS SPIRIT IN HIM FOOTNOTE 14
AND THAT A REVOLT IN THE IRISH TENDING ONLY TO VINDICATE THEIR NATIVE LIBERTY AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF FOREIGN INVADERS COULD NEVER AT ANY TIME BE DEEMED REBELLION MUCH LESS DURING THE PRESENT CONFUSIONS WHEN THEIR PRINCE WAS IN A MANNER A PRISONER AND OBEDIENCE MUST BE PAID NOT TO HIM BUT TO THOSE WHO HAD TRAITOROUSLY USURPED HIS LAWFUL AUTHORITY BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS MORE ENGAGED ALL THE HEADS OF THE NATIVE IRISH INTO THE CONSPIRACY
AND SECURED THE NAVAL AS WELL AS MILITARY FORCE IN HANDS FAVORABLE TO THE PUBLIC SETTLEMENT
YET ALL THE EVIDENCES WHICH WOULD ROB THE KING OF THAT HONOR TEND TO PROVE THAT DR GAUDEN HAD THE MERIT OF WRITING SO FINE A PERFORMANCE AND THE INFAMY OF IMPOSING IT ON THE WORLD FOR THE KING'S
WHILE THEY PRETEND TO INCULCATE AN AXIOM PECULIAR TO ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE THEY VIOLATE THE MOST ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN NATURE
IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH
BROKEN ARMIES DISORDERED FINANCES SLOW AND IRRESOLUTE COUNSELS BY THESE RESOURCES ALONE WERE THE DISPERSED PROVINCES OF SPAIN DEFENDED AGAINST THE VIGOROUS POWER OF FRANCE
THE EARL OF TRAQUAIRE HAD INTERCEPTED A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE KING OF FRANCE BY THE SCOTTISH MALECONTENTS AND HAD CONVEYED THIS LETTER TO THE KING
BUT SO PRECARIOUS IN MOST MEN IS THIS QUALITY OF MILITARY COURAGE A POORER DEFENCE WAS NOT MADE BY ANY TOWN DURING THE WHOLE WAR
THE PARLIAMENT THAT THEY MIGHT RELIEVE THE NORTHERN COUNTIES FROM SO GRIEVOUS A BURDEN AGREED TO REMIT PAY TO THE SCOTTISH AS WELL AS TO THE ENGLISH ARMY
OF FRANCE
OF FRANCE
AND DIVIDED THE WHOLE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND INTO SO MANY MILITARY JURISDICTIONS PARL
HE ALONE DURING THE TRANSACTIONS OF TWO MONTHS WAS OBLIGED TO MAINTAIN THE ARGUMENT AGAINST FIFTEEN MEN OF THE GREATEST PARTS AND CAPACITY IN BOTH HOUSES
WHEN THIS REMONSTRANCE WAS DISPERSED IT EXCITED EVERY WHERE THE SAME VIOLENT CONTROVERSY WHICH ATTENDED IT WHEN INTRODUCED INTO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
SINCE SUCH A SITUATION IS NOT ANY WHERE TO BE FOUND IN HISTORY RUSH VOL
AND NO WISE MAN WHO HAS ANY HONOR OR FORTUNE TO LOSE WILL EVER ENGAGE HIMSELF IN SUCH DREADFUL SUCH UNKNOWN PERILS
HE SECRETLY MADE HIS ESCAPE FROM ARGYLE AND FLED TOWARDS THE HIGHLANDS
BUT HOW CAN WE EXPRESS OUR AFFECTIONS WHILE WE RETAIN OUR FEARS
BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT ALL THOSE HIGH CHURCHMEN WHO WERE SO INDUSTRIOUS IN REDUCING THE LAITY TO SUBMISSION WERE EXTREMELY FOND OF THEIR OWN PRIVILEGES AND INDEPENDENCY AND WERE DESIROUS OF EXEMPTING THE MITRE FROM ALL SUBJECTION TO THE CROWN
IT IS EVIDENT THAT CHARLES HAD FALLEN INTO SUCH A SITUATION THAT WHICHEVER SIDE HE EMBRACED HIS ERRORS MUST BE DANGEROUS
MANY OF THEM SEEMED INCLINED TO EXERCISE THE POWER OF THE SWORD IN THE MOST OPEN MANNER
BY RECENT AS WELL AS ALL ANCIENT EXAMPLE IT WAS BECOME EVIDENT THAT ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WITH WHATEVER PREFERENCES IT MAY BE COVERED AND WHATEVER OBJECT IT MAY PURSUE MUST INEVITABLY END AT LAST IN THE ARBITRARY AND DESPOTIC GOVERNMENT OF A SINGLE PERSON
BY SETTING SUCH A STAMP UPON THEM THAT NO LICENTIOUS SPIRIT SHALL DARE HENCEFORTH TO INVADE THEM
THAT THOUGH THE CATHOLICS HAD HITHERTO ENJOYED IN SOME TOLERABLE MEASURE THE EXERCISE OF THEIR RELIGION FROM THE MODERATION OF THEIR INDULGENT PRINCE THEY MUST HENCEFORTH EXPECT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED BY OTHER MAXIMS AND OTHER PRINCIPLES
FOR SCARCE ANY OF HIS FAULTS ROSE TO THAT PITCH AS TO MERIT THE APPELLATION OF VICES
NOT ONLY THE PRINCE IN CASES OF EXTREME DISTRESS IS EXEMPTED FROM THE ORDINARY RULES OF ADMINISTRATION
THIS STYLE THOUGH THE SENSE OF IT WAS IMPLIED IN MANY INSTITUTIONS NO FORMER KING OF ENGLAND WOULD HAVE USED AND NO SUBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO USE
MORLEY AND MOSS BROUGHT THEIR REGIMENTS INTO PALACE-YARD RESOLUTE TO OPPOSE THE VIOLENCE OF LAMBERT
AS HE MUST NECESSARILY IN HIS JOURNEY HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE TROOPS OF BOTH NATIONS THE COMMONS SEEM TO HAVE ENTERTAINED GREAT JEALOUSY ON THAT ACCOUNT AND TO HAVE NOW HURRIED ON AS MUCH AS THEY FORMERLY DELAYED THE DISBANDING OF THE ARMIES
WHILE THEY EXERCISED THE POWERS TRANSMITTED TO THEM IN A MANNER MORE INDEPENDENT AND LESS COMPLIANT THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN PRACTISED THE KINGS WERE PERHAPS IMPRUDENTLY BUT AS THEY IMAGINED FROM NECESSITY TEMPTED TO ASSUME POWERS WHICH HAD SCARCELY EVER BEEN EXERCISED OR HAD BEEN EXERCISED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER BY THE CROWN
ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH

HE RESOLVED THEREFORE BEFORE IT WERE TOO LATE TO REPAIR THE DANGEROUS MISTAKE INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN BETRAYED AND TO SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD STILL MORE WITHOUT RESERVE THAT HE MEANT NO LONGER TO BE THE MINISTER OF VIOLENCE AND USURPATION
AN APPELLATION WHICH THEY REFUSED OR AT LEAST SCRUPLED TO GIVE TO THE OTHERS SO OPENLY WERE THESE TENETS ESPOUSED THAT NOT ONLY THE DISCONTENTED PURITANS BELIEVED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO BE RELAPSING FAST INTO ROMISH SUPERSTITION
HE OBTESTED HEAVEN AND EARTH THAT HIS DEVOTED ATTACHMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT HAD RENDERED HIM SO ODIOUS IN THE ARMY THAT HIS LIFE WHILE AMONG THEM WAS IN THE UTMOST DANGER
IN ALL PLACES DEATH AND SLAUGHTER WERE NOT UNCOMMON
THE ENGLISH ROYALISTS EXCLAIMED LOUDLY AGAINST HAMILTON'S DELAYS WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED TO A REFINED POLICY IN THE SCOTS AS IF THEIR INTENTIONS WERE THAT ALL THE KING'S PARTY SHOULD FIRST BE SUPPRESSED AND THE VICTORY REMAIN SOLELY TO THE PRESBYTERIANS
ONE PERSON ALONE SAID THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM GUILTY OF HIGH TREASON
BY BRINGING SO GREAT A NUMBER OF HIS FRIENDS AND ADHERENTS INTO THE OTHER HOUSE HE HAD LOST THE MAJORITY AMONG THE NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES
IN ORDER TO REPAIR THIS DISHONOR THE DUKE WENT TO PORTSMOUTH WHERE HE HAD PREPARED A CONSIDERABLE FLEET AND ARMY ON WHICH ALL THE SUBSIDIES GIVEN BY PARLIAMENT HAD BEEN EXPENDED
THE VIOLENT DISSOLUTION OF FOUR PARLIAMENTS

HIS TEMPER WAS NATURALLY RESERVED
THEY COMMISSIONED HIM TO SUPPRESS THE REBELS
PROCLAMATIONS AND ACTS OF STATE DECLARED OF NO AUTHORITY
BUT THE AFFECTIONS OF CORNWALL WERE MUCH INCLINED TO THE KING'S SERVICE
WHAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS MOST INTENT UPON WAS NOT THEIR TREATY WITH THE KING TO WHOM THEY PAID LITTLE REGARD BUT THAT WITH THE SCOTS
THE PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT THE DANGER OF RELIGION THE REBELLION OF IRELAND THE DECAY OF TRADE
FAIRFAX WAS A PERSON EQUALLY EMINENT FOR COURAGE AND FOR HUMANITY
AND WHEN FOR THEIR DELIVERANCE THEY WERE BROUGHT BEFORE JUSTICE BY YOUR MAJESTY'S WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS THERE TO UNDERGO AND RECEIVE AS THE COURT SHOULD ORDER AND THEIR KEEPERS COMMANDED TO CERTIFY THE CAUSES OF THEIR DETAINER NO CAUSE WAS CERTIFIED BUT THAT THEY WERE DETAINED BY YOUR MAJESTY'S SPECIAL COMMAND SIGNIFIED BY THE LORDS OF YOUR PRIVY COUNCIL AND YET WERE RETURNED BACK TO SEVERAL PRISONS WITHOUT BEING CHARGED WITH ANY THING TO WHICH THEY MIGHT MAKE ANSWER ACCORDING TO THE LAW
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED OF THE MEN OF ATHOLE FLOCKED TO HIS STANDARD
AN ORDER WAS EVEN ISSUED TO CONFINE ALL THE NATIVE IRISH TO THE PROVINCE OF CONNAUGHT WHERE THEY WOULD BE SHUT UP BY RIVERS LAKES AND MOUNTAINS AND COULD NOT IT WAS HOPED BE ANY LONGER DANGEROUS TO THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT
THIS GREAT MAN WAS MUCH FAVORED BY CHARLES I WHO GAVE HIM THE LIBERTY OF USING ALL THE DEER IN THE ROYAL FORESTS FOR PERFECTING HIS DISCOVERIES ON THE GENERATION OF ANIMALS
THE RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY IT MAY BE REMARKED IS OF A PECULIAR NATURE
NEXT HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE CUP WHICH HAD A COVER UPON IT AND WAS FILLED WITH WINE
SO AVOWED AND VIOLENT WERE THE SCOTS IN THEIR RESENTMENT OF ALL THESE MEASURES THAT THEY HAD REFUSED TO SEND COMMISSIONERS TO TREAT AT YORK AS WAS AT FIRST PROPOSED
HE ASKED THEM WHAT THEY DID THERE
HE TOOK THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS FOUR BROTHERS EQUALLY HONORABLE WITH HIMSELF

AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
BUT WERE NOW DESIRED TO MIND THEIR HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AND LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE TO THE MEN
AND THE PARLIAMENT NOW SEEMED TO BE AGAIN POSSESSED OF MORE ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY THAN EVER AND TO BE WITHOUT ANY DANGER OF OPPOSITION OR CONTROL
BORROW OF THE CITY A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS
AND THE SAME GENERAL PLAN OF POLICY THOUGH BY MEN OF SUCH OPPOSITE CHARACTERS WAS STILL CONTINUED IN THE FRENCH COUNCILS
THEY BEGAN WITH HARASSING IMPRISONING AND MOLESTING THE CLERGY
PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THEY WERE HAD BEEN ENCOURAGED IN THEM BY EVERY CONSIDERATION HUMAN AND DIVINE
IT CONTAINETH BEGGARLY RUDIMENTS MILK FOR BABES
THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
ONLY ONE OF THE CRIMINALS SUFFERED DEATH
THIS IS THE IMMUTABLE RESOLUTION AND SHALL BE THE UNDOUBTED PRACTICE OF HIM WHO ACCOUNTS IT HIS CHIEFEST GLORY TO BE HIS MAJESTY'S MOST LOYAL AND OBEDIENT SUBJECT DERBY FOOTNOTE 25
LET THE REMAINING ARTICLES OF PREROGATIVE BE LEFT UNTOUCHED
IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT AFTER A LONG TRIAL AND THE EXAMINATION OF ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WITNESSES THE COMMONS FOUND SO LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF OBTAINING A JUDICIAL SENTENCE AGAINST LAUD THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THEIR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND TO PASS AN ORDINANCE FOR TAKING AWAY THE LIFE OF THIS AGED PRELATE
IN VAIN WAS IT URGED THAT A PROMISE GIVEN TO THE PARLIAMENT COULD NO LONGER BE BINDING
NINE OF THE BISHOPS WERE PRIVY COUNCILLORS
AND SUCH AS WERE SUSPECTED OF FRIENDSHIP TO THAT OBNOXIOUS MINISTER WERE SURE TO MEET WITH MENACES NOT UNACCOMPANIED WITH SYMPTOMS OF THE MOST DESPERATE RESOLUTIONS IN THE FURIOUS POPULACE COMPLAINTS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS BEING MADE AGAINST THESE VIOLENCES AS THE MOST FLAGRANT BREACH OF PRIVILEGE THE RULING MEMBERS BY THEIR AFFECTED COOLNESS AND INDIFFERENCE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE POPULAR TUMULTS WERE NOT DISAGREEABLE TO THEM.[V BUT A NEW DISCOVERY MADE ABOUT THIS TIME SERVED TO THROW EVERY THING INTO STILL GREATER FLAME AND COMBUSTION
HAVING TAKEN ESTIONAGE CROMWELL THREW A BRIDGE OVER THE BARROW AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF PASSAGE AND CARRIE
A LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN THE FOREGOING SPRING TO THE EARL OF ESSEX AND SUBSCRIBED BY THE PRINCE THE DUKE OF YORK AND FORTY-THREE NOBLEMEN THEY THERE EXHORT HIM TO BE AN INSTRUMENT OF RESTORING PEACE AND TO PROMOTE THAT HAPPY END WITH THOSE BY WHOM HE WAS EMPLOYED
BUT IN ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS THE OPPOSITION AMONG THE COMMONS WAS SO CONSIDERABLE AND THE DEBATES WERE SO MUCH PROLONGED THAT ALL BUSINESS WAS RETARDED AND GREAT ALARM GIVEN TO THE PARTISANS OF THE YOUNG PROTECTOR
AND THAT HE COULD NOT BETTER PREPARE HIMSELF FOR THAT GREAT DUTY THAN BY CONTRIBUTING SO THE PUBLIC SERVICE
AND THE WHOLE CITY WAS IN A FERMENT AND RESOUNDED WITH MILITARY PREPARATIONS WHEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ARRIVED THAT THE ARMY STOPPED OR RETREATED THE SHOUT OF ONE AND ALL RAN WITH ALACRITY FROM STREET TO STREET AMONG THE CITIZENS
SO HE WAS ANSWERED I BUT NOT IN HIS ENTERTAINMENT
AND THOUGH HE WAS POSSESSED OF IT BEFORE THE CIVIL COMMOTIONS AND OWED IT NOT TO THE FAVOR OF THE PARLIAMENT YET WAS HE READY TO RESIGN IT AND TO SACRIFICE TO THE WELFARE OF HIS COUNTRY EVERY CONSIDERATION OF PRIVATE INTEREST AND ADVANTAGE
LAWS WHO HAD NOT BEEN SURPASSED BY ANY MUSICIAN BEFORE HIM WAS MUCH BELOVED BY THE KING WHO CALLED HIM THE FATHER OF MUSIC
FAIRFAX SUDDENLY ATTACKED THE CAMP OF THE ROYALISTS

AND IT WOULD EVEN BECOME NECESSARY FOR THE KING AND COUNCIL TO EXERT A GREAT DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY AND BY ACTS OF STATE TO SUPPLY IN EVERY EMERGENCE THE LEGISLATIVE POWER WHOSE MEETING WAS SO UNCERTAIN AND PRECARIOUS

SUCH WERE THE FRUITS OF BUCKINGHAM'S EXPEDITION AGAINST FRANCE

AND LASTLY FOR THERE IS NO END OF ENUMERATING EVERY PARTICULAR OF HIS GLORY WITH ONE WORD BEQUEATH ALL THIS POWER AND SPLENDOR TO HIS POSTERITY
THE KING SENT THITHER THE MARQUIS OF HERTFORD AND PRINCE MAURICE WITH A REENFORCEMENT OF CAVALRY
THESE WERE ALL THE PREPARATIONS WHICH HE COULD MAKE AGAINST A KINGDOM SETTLED IN DOMESTIC PEACE SUPPORTED BY A DISCIPLINED ARMY FULLY APPRISED OF HIS ENTERPRISE AND PREPARED AGAINST HIM
FINDING BY EXPERIENCE HOW UNSUCCESSFUL THOSE MEASURES HAD PROVED AND OBSERVING THE LOW CONDITION TO WHICH HE WAS NOW REDUCED HE RESOLVED TO ALTER HIS WHOLE CONDUCT AND TO REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS PEOPLE BY PLIABLENESS BY CONCESSIONS AND BY A TOTAL CONFORMITY TO THEIR INCLINATIONS AND PREJUDICES

HE BROUGHT A GREAT ACCESSION OF FRIENDS AND OF CREDIT TO THE PARTY WHICH HE EMBRACED
EVEN THE IMPOSITION OF SHIP MONEY INDEPENDENT OF THE CONSEQUENCES WAS A GREAT AND EVIDENT ADVANTAGE TO THE PUBLIC BY THE JUDICIOUS USE WHICH THE KING MADE OF THE MONEY LEVIED BY THAT EXPEDIENT
WHILE THE COMMONS WERE IN THIS DISPOSITION THE IRISH REBELLION WAS THE EVENT WHICH TENDED MOST TO PROMOTE THE VIEWS IN WHICH ALL THEIR MEASURES TERMINATED
BUT CROMWELL SENSIBLE OF HIS MERIT HAVING SOLICITED HIM TO ENGAGE IN THE WARS AGAINST THE IRISH WHO WERE CONSIDERED AS REBELS BOTH BY KING AND PARLIAMENT HE WAS NOT UNWILLING TO REPAIR HIS BROKEN FORTUNES BY ACCEPTING A COMMAND WHICH HE FLATTERED HIMSELF WAS RECONCILABLE TO THE STRICTEST PRINCIPLES OF HONOR
BUT AS THE FAR GREATER PART OF THE NOBILITY AND LANDED GENTRY WERE HIS FRIENDS HE REAPED MUCH LESS PROFIT FROM THIS MEASURE
AND HIS POWER INSTEAD OF BEING CONFIRMED BY TIME AND SUCCESS SEEMED EVERY DAY TO BECOME MORE UNCERTAIN AND PRECARIOUS
AMONG THE REST HAMBDEN WHO HAD A REGIMENT OF INFANTRY THAT LAY AT A DISTANCE JOINED THE HORSE AS A VOLUNTEER
THEY KNEW THAT THEIR OWN VOTE DECLARING THE ILLEGALITY OF THE FORMER MEASURES HAD NOT OF ITSELF SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST FUTURE INVASION
159 WHILE WE WERE PRAYING THEY WERE FIGHTING
AND THOUGH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH HIM THAT HE SHOULD LAY ASIDE THAT JOURNEY THEY COULD NOT PREVAIL WITH HIM SO MUCH AS TO DELAY IT
NO IMPUTATION OF RAPACITY COULD JUSTLY LIE AGAINST HIS ADMINISTRATION
BUT FANCIED THAT EVERY ONE WHO WAS DISSATISFIED LIKE THEM HAD ALSO EMBRACED THE SAME VIEWS AND INCLINATIONS
AND BY THIS MEANS THE SCOTTISH PLANTERS MOST OF THEM AT LEAST ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES FROM ULSTER THE FLAMES OF REBELLION DIFFUSED THEMSELVES IN AN INSTANT OVER THE OTHER THREE PROVINCES OF IRELAND

THERE PREVAILS A STORY THAT CROMWELL INTERCEPTED A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE QUEEN WHERE THE KING SAID THAT HE WOULD FIRST RAISE AND THEN DESTROY CROMWELL
SUPPORTED BY COURAGE CONDUCTED BY PRUDENCE EMBELLISHED BY MODESTY

THAT TO REPOSE A REASONABLE CONFIDENCE IN THE KING AND GENEROUSLY TO SUPPLY HIS PRESENT WANTS WHICH PROCEEDED NEITHER FROM PRODIGALITY NOR MISCONDUCT WOULD BE THE TRUE MEANS OF GAINING ON HIS GENEROUS NATURE AND EXTORTING BY A GENTLE VIOLENCE SUCH CONCESSIONS AS WERE REQUISITE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC LIBERTY

THESE WERE SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX SON OF THE LORD OF THAT NAME AND OLIVER CROMWELL

THE HUGONOTS HE EXPECTED WOULD MEET WITH BETTER TREATMENT WHILE HE ENGAGED IN A CLOSE UNION WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN AND AS THE SPANIARDS WERE MUCH MORE PAPISTS THAN THE FRENCH WERE MUCH MORE EXPOSED TO THE OLD PURITANICAL HATRED AND HAD EVEN ERECTED THE BLOODY TRIBUNAL OF THE INQUISITION WHOSE RIGORS THEY HAD REFUSED TO MITIGATE ON CROMWELL'S SOLICITATION HE HOPED THAT A HOLY AND MERITORIOUS WAR WITH SUCH IDOLATERS COULD NOT FAIL OF PROTECTION FROM HEAVEN A PREACHER LIKEWISE INSPIRED AS WAS SUPPOSED BY A PROPHETIC SPIRIT BID HIM GO AND PROSPER CALLING HIM A STONE CUT OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT HANDS THAT WOULD BREAK THE PRIDE OF THE SPANIARD CRUSH ANTICHRIST AND MAKE WAY FOR THE PURITY OF THE GOSPEL OVER THE WHOLE WORLD."[V THURLOE VOL

AND THE POPULACE WHO ARE ALWAYS TERRIFIED WITH PRESENT AND ENRAGED WITH DISTANT DANGERS WERE STILL FURTHER ANIMATED IN THEIR DEMANDS OF JUSTICE AGAINST THE UNFORTUNATE STRAFFORD
ROLLO A POPULAR PREACHER AND ZEALOUS COVENANTER WAS HER GREAT FAVORITE AND PAID HER ON HIS PART NO LESS VENERATION
AND SO STRONG WAS THE CURRENT FOR POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN ALL THE THREE KINGDOMS THAT THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF POLICY WERE EVERY WHERE ABANDONED IN ORDER TO GRATIFY THIS RULING PASSION
BUT STILL ALLOWED HIM A CONSIDERABLE PENSION OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR AS A BRIBE FOR HIS FUTURE PEACEABLE DEPORTMENT
THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY REDUCED FROM ITS ANCIENT AND LEGAL HEIGHT BUT WHEN ONCE PUSHED DOWNWARDS IT SOON BECAME CONTEMPTIBLE AND WOULD EASILY BY THE CONTINUANCE OF THE SAME EFFORT NOW ENCOURAGED BY SUCCESS BE CARRIED TO THE LOWEST EXTREMITY
P 982
THIS IS AN AUTHOR OF SPIRIT AND INGENUITY
THE CLERGY RENEWED THEIR EXCOMMUNICATIONS AGAINST HIM AND HIS ADHERENTS AND ADDED THE TERRORS OF SUPERSTITION TO THOSE WHICH AROSE FROM A VICTORIOUS ENEMY
BUT CRUEL AND BARBAROUS WAS THEIR HUMANITY
GOVERNMENT IS INSTITUTED IN ORDER TO RESTRAIN THE FURY AND INJUSTICE OF THE PEOPLE
AND ANY INDIVIDUAL MAY CONSULT THE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ANY EXPEDIENT WHICH HIS SITUATION ENABLES HIM TO EMPLOY
EXAMPLES OF A MORE SUDDEN AND VIOLENT CHANGE OF PROPERTY ARE SCARCELY TO BE FOUND IN ANY HISTORY
AND HE CAREFULLY KEPT HIMSELF WITHIN HIS INTRENCHMENTS
348 354
THE KING'S LETTER INTERCEPTED AT NASEBY HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH CLAMOR
AND THEY DEEMED SO IRREGULAR AND LAWLESS A DEED BEST FITTED TO SUCH IRREGULAR AND LAWLESS INSTRUMENTS BUT THE GENERALS WERE TOO WISE TO LOAD THEMSELVES SINGLY WITH THE INFAMY WHICH THEY KNEW MUST ATTEND AN ACTION SO SHOCKING TO THE GENERAL SENTIMENTS OF MANKIND
NEAR THE DOOR THERE WAS FOUND A HAT IN THE INSIDE OF WHICH WAS SEWED A PAPER CONTAINING FOUR OR FIVE LINES OF THAT REMONSTRANCE OF THE COMMONS WHICH DECLARED BUCKINGHAM AN ENEMY TO THE KINGDOM
WITHOUT ONE DISSENTING VOICE AND ALMOST WITHOUT DELIBERATION THEY INSTANTLY REJECTED THE VOTE OF THE LOWER HOUSE AND ADJOURNED THEMSELVES FOR TEN DAYS HOPING THAT THIS DELAY WOULD BE ABLE TO RETARD THE FURIOUS CAREER OF THE COMMONS
THEY SENT OVER A COMMITTEE TO LONDON TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION OF THEIR UNFORTUNATE GOVERNOR
AND THOUGH ORDERS WERE ISSUED BY THE MAGISTRATES TO ARREST THEM THESE WERE EXECUTED WITH SUCH SLOWNESS AND RELUCTANCE THAT THE CRIMINALS HAD ALL OF THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THEIR ESCAPE
A STAMP DUTY WAS IMPOSED ON CARDS
THE CHANCELLOR TREASURER ADMIRAL CHIEF GOVERNORS OF IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THE CHIEF JUSTICES OF BOTH THE BENCHES MUST BE CHOSEN WITH THE APPROBATION OF PARLIAMENT
SO THAT SCARCE ANY VICTORY COULD BE MORE COMPLETE THAN THAT WHICH HE OBTAINED
HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE SMALL FORT OF PRIE WHICH COULD AT FIRST HAVE MADE NO MANNER OF RESISTANCE
USE ALL WORTHY MEANS TO RESTORE YOURSELF TO YOUR RIGHTS BUT PREFER THE WAY OF PEACE
WITH EQUAL EASE WERE JERSEY GUERNSEY SCILLY AND THE ISLE OF MAN BROUGHT UNDER SUBJECTION TO THE REPUBLIC
HIS AFFECTIONS WERE EASILY CAPABLE UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF OF DISGUISING THE LATTER
THIS IS THE CASE EVEN IF WE CONSIDER THE EXTERNAL EVIDENCE
AND BLAKE WENT SO FAR AS TO ATTACK AND SEIZE A WHOLE SQUADRON OF SHIPS WHICH WERE CARRYING SUPPLIES TO DUNKIRK THEN CLOSELY BESIEGED BY THE SPANIARDS
THAT HE COULD NOT NOW PERCEIVE ANY APPEARANCE OF THE UPPER HOUSE SO ESSENTIAL A MEMBER OF THE CONSTITUTION
THE MORE THEY WERE REDUCED TO SUBJECTION THE GREATER SUPERIORITY DID THEY AFFECT ABOVE THOSE USURPERS WHO BY VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE HAD ACQUIRED AN ASCENDANT OVER THEM
BUT THE KING EVEN BEFORE HERTFORD'S ARRIVAL HEARING OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES TO WHICH HIS WESTERN ARMY WAS REDUCED HAD PREPARED A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF CAVALRY WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DESPATCHED TO THEIR SUCCOR UNDER THE COMMAND OF LORD WILMOT
THE FORM OF A PETITION TO THE KING AND PARLIAMENT WAS CONCERTED
AND IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE DESTRUCTIVE EXPEDIENT OF PLUNDER AND FREE QUARTERS THE COUNTRY CONSENTED TO GIVE THEM A REGULAR CONTRIBUTION OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A DAY IN FULL OF THEIR SUBSISTENCE RUSH
THE GENIUS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS SO CLOSELY AT THIS TIME INTERWOVEN WITH POLITICS CORRESPONDED EXACTLY TO THESE DIVISIONS
AND WITH SO MUCH SUCCESS THAT ACCORDING TO THE CONFESSION OF ALL THEY HAD NEVER BEFORE IN ANY OF THEIR DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES ENJOYED SO MUCH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AS WAS THEN COMMUNICATED TO THEM THEIR HEARTS WERE NO DOUBT DILATED WHEN THEY CONSIDERED THE HIGH DIGNITY TO WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THEMSELVES EXALTED
AS IF HE WERE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A SUSPICION OF BAD INTENTIONS WHERE THE ACTIONS WERE PRAISEWORTHY
THE POWER OF PEACE AND WAR WAS LODGED IN THE SAME HANDS WITH THAT OF IMPOSING TAXES
65
65

FOR THERE SCARCELY COULD BE ANY
THOUGH THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED THE KING RESOLVED UPON THE ATTACK
ALL HIS FAMILY THAT REMAINED IN ENGLAND WERE ALLOWED ACCESS TO HIM
A SMALL PART OF FIFTY-SIX WEEKS WHICH THEY CLAIMED AS THEIR DUE
WALKER P 6
202 203
TEWKESBURY UNDERWENT THE SAME FATE
TO THIS MAN CHARLES INTRUSTED HIMSELF
THE CATHOLICS PRETENDING TO AN INFALLIBLE GUIDE HAD JUSTIFIED UPON THAT PRINCIPLE THEIR DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF PERSECUTION
THAT ASSEMBLY COULD NOT BE DISSOLVED IT WAS ASSERTED BUT BY THEIR OWN CONSENT
THOUGH ANCIENT PRECEDENTS WERE PLEADED IN FAVOR OF THE KING'S MEASURES A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE UPON COMPARISON WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE CASES
SPAIN INVITED HIM TO RETURN TO THE LOW COUNTRIES AND EMBARK IN SOME OF HER MARITIME TOWNS
THE CARTOONS WHEN COMPLETE WERE ONLY APPRAISED AT THREE HUNDRED POUNDS THOUGH THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF THE KING'S CURIOSITIES WAS SOLD AT ABOVE FIFTY THOUSAND NEALE'S HISTORY OF THE PURITANS VOL
BUT AS THEY COULD OBTAIN NO CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES THE STATES UNWILLING TO SUFFER ANY LONGER THE LOSS AND DISHONOR OF BEING BLOCKADED BY THE ENEMY MADE THE UTMOST EFFORTS TO RECOVER THEIR INJURED HONOR
SEVERAL SEA OFFICERS HAVING ENTERTAINED SCRUPLES OF CONSCIENCE WITH REGARD TO THE JUSTICE OF THE SPANISH WAR THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND RETIRED THURLOE VOL
THE PRINCE WHO WAS ENTIRELY FITTED FOR THAT KIND OF SERVICE FALLING SUDDENLY UPON THE DISPERSED BODIES OF ESSEX'S ARMY ROUTED TWO REGIMENTS OF CAVALRY AND ONE OF INFANTRY AND CARRIED HIS RAVAGES WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE GENERAL'S QUARTERS
AN EVENT MEMORABLE IN THE ANNALS OF HUMAN KIND AND WORTHY TO BE HELD IN PERPETUAL DETESTATION AND ABHORRENCE
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE EFFORTS OF THE COMMONS THEY COULD NOT EXPECT THE CONCURRENCE OF THE UPPER HOUSE EITHER TO THIS LAW OR TO ANY OTHER WHICH THEY SHOULD INTRODUCE FOR THE FURTHER LIMITATION OF ROYAL AUTHORITY
THURLOE
THAT WHILE ON HIS MARCH HE OBSERVED ALL RANKS OF MEN IN ALL PLACES TO BE IN EARNEST EXPECTATION OF A SETTLEMENT AFTER THE VIOLENT CONVULSIONS TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN EXPOSED
THE ELEVEN IMPEACHED MEMBERS BEING ACCUSED AS AUTHORS OF THE TUMULT WERE EXPELLED
WHERE IS THE MARK SET UPON THIS CRIME
AND WHOEVER HE WAS IT WAS NATURAL TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD ALREADY FLED FAR ENOUGH NOT TO BE FOUND WITHOUT A HAT
THOUGH THE LEVELLERS HAD FOR A TIME BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE AUDACIOUS SPIRIT OF CROMWELL THEY STILL CONTINUED TO PROPAGATE THEIR DOCTRINES AMONG THE PRIVATE MEN AND INFERIOR OFFICERS WHO PRETENDED A RIGHT TO BE CONSULTED AS BEFORE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
IRELAND AND SCOTLAND WERE NOW ENTIRELY SUBJECTED AND REDUCED TO TRANQUILLITY
IN HIS WHOLE CONDUCT OF THIS AFFAIR THERE APPEAR NO MARKS OF THE GOOD SENSE WITH WHICH HE WAS ENDOWED
88 CL
HE WAS CONSULTED IN NO PUBLIC MEASURE
WHEN CROMWELL AFTERWARDS ASKED JEPHSON WHAT INDUCED HIM TO MAKE SUCH A MOTION AS LONG SAID JEPHSON AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO SIT IN PARLIAMENT I MUST FOLLOW THE DICTATES OF MY OWN CONSCIENCE WHATEVER OFFENCE I MAY BE SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO GIVE YOU GET THEE GONE SAID CROMWELL GIVING HIM A GENTLE BLOW ON THE SHOULDER
ENCOURAGED BY THESE INTIMATIONS OF THEIR PLEASURE THE POPULACE CROWDED ABOUT WHITEHALL AND THREW OUT INSOLENT MENACES AGAINST CHARLES HIMSELF
AND IMMEDIATELY FOUND THAT THEY WERE DISPOSED TO RECEIVE WHATEVER IMPRESSIONS HE WAS PLEASED TO GIVE THEM
BY THE FOURTH HE GAVE THE TWO HOUSES POWER TO ADJOURN AS THEY THOUGHT PROPER
AND WAS PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE EARL OF ARUNDEL A NOBLEMAN OF GREAT FAMILY BUT CELEBRATED NEITHER FOR MILITARY NOR POLITICAL ABILITIES
FRANKLYN P 243
THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
WHERE FORM AND CIRCUMSTANCE AS EXPRESSED IN THE COMMISSION MUST BE DISPENSED WITH RATHER THAN THE SUBSTANCE BE LOST OR HAZARDED IN OTHER WORDS THIS WAS A SCHEME FOR FINDING EXPEDIENTS WHICH MIGHT RAISE THE PREROGATIVE TO THE GREATEST HEIGHT AND RENDER PARLIAMENTS ENTIRELY USELESS
RUSHWORTH VOL II
RUSHWORTH VOL II
IN ALL DISPUTES WHICH HAD PASSED ABOUT SETTLING THE TERMS OF PEACE THE SCOTS HE HEARD HAD STILL ADHERED TO THE MILDER SIDE AND HAD ENDEAVORED TO SOFTEN THE RIGOR OF THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT
EVERY MAN DREADED TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT IN THE CONTENTION BETWEEN THOSE MIGHTY POWERS WHICH DISPUTED FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE
AND EVEN HE MENTIONS IT ONLY AS A MERE RUMOR OR HEARSAY WITHOUT ANY KNOWN FOUNDATION
IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY
A JEALOUSY NOT FOUNDED ON RIVALSHIP OF POWER AND POLITICS BUT OF LOVE AND GALLANTRY
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF IT ALREADY IN CHAPTER LVIII
AND IT IS REQUISITE WHERE THE LAWS ASSIGN PRIVILEGES TO THE DIFFERENT ORDERS OF THE STATE THAT IT LIKEWISE SECURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE MEMBERS
BUT AMONG THE SCOTS IT WAS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE HOW THE LAWS WERE FRAMED OR BY WHOM VOTED WHILE THE EXORBITANT ARISTOCRACY HAD IT SO MUCH IN THEIR POWER TO PREVENT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION
IT BEING REMARKED THAT THE KING THE MOMENT BEFORE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS NECK TO THE EXECUTIONER HAD SAID TO JUXON WITH A VERY EARNEST ACCENT THE SINGLE WORD REMEMBER GREAT MYSTERIES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CONCEALED UNDER THAT EXPRESSION

400
YET WAS THIS THE TIME WHICH LAUD CHOSE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW CEREMONIES AND OBSERVANCES
SEE NOTE C AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THOUGH THE IDOL OF THE PEOPLE THEY DETERMINED TO FORTIFY THEMSELVES LIKEWISE WITH TERRORS AND TO OVERAWE THOSE WHO MIGHT STILL BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE FALLING RUINS OF MONARCHY
THE KING BY HIS CORONATION OATH PROMISES THAT HE WOULD MAINTAIN THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD CHOSEN QUAS VULGUS ELEGERIT THE PARLIAMENT PRETENDED THAT ELEGERIT MEANT SHALL CHOOSE
263
THE ENGLISH COMMONS PRETENDING APPREHENSIONS LEST REGULAR BODIES OF TROOPS DISCIPLINED IN THE LOW COUNTRIES SHOULD PROVE STILL MORE DANGEROUS SHOWED SOME AVERSION TO THIS EXPEDIENT
THE MOST EFFECTUAL EXPEDIENT FOR PAYING COURT TO THE ZEALOUS SCOTS WAS TO PROMOTE THE PRESBYTERIAN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP THROUGHOUT ENGLAND
MEMORIALS BOTH TO THE KING AND PARLIAMENT WERE TRANSMITTED BY THE JUSTICES AND COUNCIL IN WHICH THEN WANTS AND DANGERS ARE STRONGLY SET FORTH AND THOUGH THE GENERAL EXPRESSIONS IN THESE MEMORIALS MIGHT PERHAPS BE SUSPECTED OF EXAGGERATION YET FROM THE PARTICULAR FACTS MENTIONED FROM THE CONFESSION OF THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT ITSELF AND FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THINGS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE IRISH PROTESTANTS WERE REDUCED TO GREAT EXTREMITIES AND IT BECAME PRUDENT IN THE KING IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EMBRACE SOME EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT SECURE THEM FOR A TIME FROM THE RUIN AND MISERY WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED
THESE COUNSELS FOR SUPPLY WERE CONDUCTED WITH SOME MODERATION
389
BUT THERE STILL REMAINED TO HIM A GOOD CAUSE AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
AND THAT THEY NOW PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO SAVE BY THEIR OWN PUNISHMENT THAT PRECIOUS LIFE WHICH IT BECAME THE COMMONS THEMSELVES AND EVERY SUBJECT WITH THE UTMOST HAZARD TO PROTECT AND DEFEND SUCH A GENEROUS EFFORT TENDED TO THEIR HONOR BUT CONTRIBUTED NOTHING TOWARDS THE KING'S SAFETY
THE FEMALE CONQUERORS HAVING LAID HOLD ON THE SYNOD CLERK BEAT HIM TILL HE FORSWORE HIS OFFICE
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE FORMS A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE NARRATIVE OF THE DUTCH ADMIRAL
IN PROPORTION AS THE KING DECLINED IN POPULARITY HERTFORD'S CHARACTER FLOURISHED WITH THE PEOPLE
AND HE BEGAN TO SEEK PROSELYTES
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WHEN INFORMED OF THESE TRANSACTIONS SHOWED THE SAME ATTACHMENT WITH THE SAILORS FOR THE PROTESTANT RELIGION
495
A YOUNG PRINCE JEALOUS OF HONOR WAS NATURALLY AFRAID OF BEING FOILED IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE AND HAD NOT AS YET ATTAINED SUCH MATURITY OF COUNSEL AS TO PERCEIVE THAT HIS GREATEST HONOR LAY IN PRESERVING THE LAWS INVIOLATE AND GAINING THE FULL CONFIDENCE OF HIS PEOPLE
273 591
HE GAVE A HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR TO THE DIVINITY PROFESSOR AT OXFORD
THEY SENT HIM ENVOY TO HOLLAND
MANY OF THE MEMBERS THOUGHT THAT A FOREIGN WAR WOULD SERVE AS A PRETENCE FOR CONTINUING THE SAME PARLIAMENT AND DELAYING THE NEW MODEL OF A REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHICH THE NATION HAD SO LONG BEEN FLATTERED
I SHALL ONLY ENDEAVOR TO REMOVE FROM IT SOMEWHAT OF THE MARVELLOUS
THEN YOU MAY GO ELSEWHERE REPLIED HE
HE WAS EVEN SO INCONSIDERATE AS TO LOSE TIME IN SUMMONING AND ATTACKING THE ARTILLERY OF THE ENEMY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT WITH A GOOD GUARD OF INFANTRY
TROMP GALLANTLY ANIMATING HIS MEN WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEART WITH A MUSKET BALL
AND LYING AT THE BACK OF THE KING MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KEEP HIS POST ANY LONGER
HIS ELDER AND YOUNGER BROTHERS WERE DEVOTED TO THE ROYAL CAUSE
ILLEGAL TAXES EXTORTED
JUXON BISHOP OF LONDON WHO HAD NEVER DESIRED THE TREASURER'S STAFF NOW EARNESTLY SOLICITED FOR LEAVE TO RESIGN IT AND RETIRE TO THE CARE OF THAT TURBULENT DIOCESE COMMITTED TO HIM
AND HAVE LEFT A MEMORABLE LESSON TO POSTERITY HOW DELUSIVE HOW DESTRUCTIVE THAT PRINCIPLE IS BY WHICH THEY WERE ANIMATED
BUT THE COMMONS WHEN ASSEMBLED FOUND MANY OTHER CAUSES OF COMPLAINT
MONTROSE SMILED AT THIS NEW INSTANCE OF THEIR MALICE
HE NEXT SAILED TO ALGIERS AND COMPELLED THE DEY TO MAKE PEACE AND TO RESTRAIN HIS PIRATICAL SUBJECTS FROM FURTHER VIOLENCES ON THE ENGLISH
THE EARL SEEMED SURPRISED AND STARTING UP EXCLAIMED IN THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE PUT NOT YOUR TRUST IN PRINCES NOR IN THE SONS OF MEN FOR IN THEM THERE IS NO SALVATION HE WAS SOON ABLE HOWEVER TO COLLECT HIS COURAGE
WHERE THE DUKE WAS AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE CARDINAL AS HE WAS INFERIOR IN EVERY OTHER PARTICULAR
INFLUENCED BY THE CLAMOR OF HIS PARTY MORE THAN HIS OWN SUSPICIONS CHARLES AS SOON AS HAMILTON APPEARED SENT HIM PRISONER TO PENDENNIS CASTLE IN CORNWALL
AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED
BECAUSE THEY CAME NOT TO THE HELP OF THE LORD TO THE HELP OF THE LORD AGAINST THE MIGHTY
AND WHEN STRAFFORD STILL INSISTED ON THE DANGER OF HIS APPEARING AMIDST SO MANY ENRAGED ENEMIES THE KING LITTLE APPREHENSIVE THAT HIS OWN AUTHORITY WAS SO SUDDENLY TO EXPIRE PROMISED HIM PROTECTION AND ASSURED HIM THAT NOT A HAIR OF HIS HEAD SHOULD BE TOUCHED BY THE PARLIAMENT NO SOONER WAS STRAFFORD'S ARRIVAL KNOWN THAN A CONCERTED ATTACK WAS MADE UPON HIM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
HERE WINRAM LAIRD OF LIBERTON CAME TO HIM AS DEPUTY FROM THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES IN SCOTLAND AND INFORMED HIM OF THE CONDITIONS TO WHICH HE MUST NECESSARILY SUBMIT BEFORE HE COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE EXERCISE OF HIS AUTHORITY
THE ENGLISH FLEET CONSISTING OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND COMMANDED BY MONK AND DEAN AND UNDER THEM BY PEN AND LAUSON MET NEAR THE COAST OF FLANDERS WITH THE DUTCH FLEET EQUALLY NUMEROUS AND COMMANDED BY TROMP
ORMOND NOT DOUBTING BUT A PEACE SO ADVANTAGEOUS AND EVEN NECESSARY TO THE IRISH WOULD BE STRICTLY OBSERVED ADVANCED WITH A SMALL BODY OF TROOPS TO KILKENNY IN ORDER TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR COMMON DEFENCE WITH HIS NEW ALLIES
THE INTERPOSITION OF PEERS IN THE ELECTION OF COMMONERS WAS LIKEWISE ABOUT THIS TIME DECLARED A BREACH OF PRIVILEGE AND CONTINUES EVER SINCE TO BE CONDEMNED BY VOTES OF THE COMMONS AND UNIVERSALLY PRACTISED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
THE LORD HAS DONE WITH YOU
A LETTER WAS PRETENDED TO BE INTERCEPTED AND WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE COMMITTEE WHO PRETENDED TO LAY GREAT STRESS UPON IT
THE CLERGY WERE ALARMED
THE UTMOST THAT COULD BE OBTAINED BY THE OFFICERS AND BY THE COURT PARTY,---FOR SO THEY WERE CALLED,--WAS TO PROTRACT THE DEBATE BY ARGUMENTS AND LONG SPEECHES AND PREVENT THE DECISION OF A QUESTION WHICH THEY WERE SENSIBLE WOULD BE CARRIED AGAINST THEM BY A GREAT MAJORITY
AND FOR SUPPLY HE MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO AN ENGLISH PARLIAMENT WHICH BY FATAL EXPERIENCE HE HAD EVER FOUND MORE READY TO ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVES THAN TO SUPPLY THE NECESSITIES OF THE CROWN
PETITIONS TO THE COUNCIL WERE SIGNED AND PRESENTED BY PERSONS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY
THE KING'S PRECEDING CONCESSIONS SO FAR FROM BEING INSUFFICIENT FOR PUBLIC SECURITY HAVE RATHER ERRED ON THE OTHER EXTREME
THE SPANISH LOW COUNTRIES IF NOT EVERY PART OF THAT MONARCHY LAY ALMOST ENTIRELY AT THE MERCY OF ITS ENEMY
THE SEAMEN NATURALLY FOLLOWED THE DISPOSITION OF THE SEA PORTS TO WHICH THEY BELONGED
HE URGED THE SACRED RIGHTS OF HOSPITALITY DUE TO EVERY ONE MUCH MORE TO A PERSON IN DISTRESS OF SO HIGH A RANK WITH WHOM THE NATION WAS SO NEARLY CONNECTED
SOME MILES FROM THE CITY THE ZEALOTS OF THEIR PARTY MET THEM IN GREAT MULTITUDES AND ATTENDED THEIR TRIUMPHANT ENTRANCE
AND IN ORDER TO REMEDY THESE GROWING EVILS THE GENERALS IN THE NAME OF THE ARMY PUBLISHED A DECLARATION IN WHICH THEY EXPRESSED THEIR RESOLUTION OF SUPPORTING LAW AND JUSTICE THE MORE TO QUIET THE MINDS OF MEN THE COUNCIL OF OFFICERS TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION A SCHEME CALLED THE AGREEMENT OF THE PEOPLE BEING THE PLAN OF A REPUBLIC TO BE SUBSTITUTED IN THE PLACE OF THAT GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY SO VIOLENTLY PULLED IN PIECES
AND THE VALUE OF PICTURES DOUBLED IN EUROPE BY THE EMULATION BETWEEN CHARLES AND PHILIP IV
I SCORN YOUR PROFFERS
946
THE COMMONS IN THEIR FURY AGAINST PRIESTS HAD SEIZED HER VERY CONFESSOR NOR WOULD THEY RELEASE HIM UPON HER REPEATED APPLICATIONS
AND THIS WE MUST DO WITHOUT FLATTERY
AND THE RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH ANIMATED ALL RANKS OF MEN MADE THEM IMMEDIATELY FLY TO THEIR STANDARDS AS SOON AS THE TRUMPET WAS SOUNDED BY THEIR SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL LEADERS
AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS
TO BE REVENGED OF THIS PARTIALITY THE ENGLISH ADMIRAL MADE PRIZE OF TWENTY PORTUGUESE SHIPS RICHLY LADEN
321
ITS PROFESSED PURPOSE WAS TO DECRY STAGE-PLAYS COMEDIES INTERLUDES MUSIC DANCING
CHARLES POSSESSED NO REGULAR FORCES IN EITHER OF HIS KINGDOMS
AND IT IS A CURIOUS FACT AS WELL WITH REGARD TO THE CHARACTERS OF THE MEN AS OF THE TIMES
BY CONCERT THESE TWO MALECONTENTS SECRETLY DREW FORCES TOGETHER AND WERE READY TO FALL ON ORMOND WHO REMAINED IN SECURITY TRUSTING TO THE PACIFICATION SO LATELY CONCLUDED WITH THE REBELS
ALL THE REST WENT TO THEIR QUARTERS WITH QUIETNESS AND RESIGNATION
AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION
ABOVE FORTY PEERS OF THE FIRST RANK ATTENDED THE KING WHILST THE HOUSE OF LORDS SELDOM CONSISTED OF MORE THAN SIXTEEN MEMBERS
386
386
FROM THIS SCENE OF CONFUSION WHICH COULD NOT LONG CONTINUE ALL MEN HE HOPED WOULD BE BROUGHT TO REFLECT ON THAT ANCIENT GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH THEY AND THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SO LONG ENJOYED HAPPINESS AND TRANQUILLITY
AND IF THESE BE TAKEN OFF WHAT FATE MUST BE EXPECTED BY THEIR FOLLOWERS WHO ARE MANY OF THEM ACCOMPLICES IN THE SAME TREASON
HE DIED IN 1688 AGED SEVENTY-THREE
EACH PARTY WAS NOW WILLING TO THROW ON ITS ANTAGONIST THE ODIUM OF COMMENCING A CIVIL WAR
THE IMPEACHMENT NEVER CAME TO A FULL DETERMINATION
HE CONSENTED THAT THE PRESENT CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THREE YEARS AFTER THAT TIME HE REQUIRED NOT THAT ANY THING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO BISHOPS BUT THE POWER OF ORDINATION AND EVEN THAT POWER TO BE EXERCISED BY ADVICE OF THE PRESBYTERS IF THE PARLIAMENT UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THAT PERIOD STILL INSISTED ON THEIR DEMAND ALL OTHER BRANCHES OF EPISCOPAL JURISDICTION WERE ABOLISHED AND A NEW FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT MUST BY COMMON CONSENT BE ESTABLISHED
791
HAMILTON WITH BETTER REASON COMPLAINED OF THE PRECIPITATE HUMOR OF THE ENGLISH ROYALISTS WHO BY THEIR ILL-TIMED INSURRECTIONS FORCED HIM TO MARCH HIS ARMY BEFORE HIS LEVIES WERE COMPLETED OR HIS PREPARATIONS IN ANY FORWARDNESS
THE PRESBYTERIANS WERE BY THEIR PRINCIPLES THE LEAST AVERSE TO REGAL AUTHORITY BUT WERE RIGIDLY BENT ON THE EXTIRPATION OF PRELACY
AND WHILE THE ZEALOUS DEVOTEES POURED OUT THEIR THOUGHTS IN UNPREMEDITATED HARANGUES THEY MISTOOK THAT ELOQUENCE WHICH TO THEIR OWN SURPRISE AS WELL AS THAT OF OTHERS FLOWED IN UPON THEM FOR DIVINE ILLUMINATIONS AND FOR ILLAPSES OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
ANTICHRIST
NEVER DID REFINED ATHENS SO EXULT IN DIFFUSING THE SCIENCES AND LIBERAL ARTS OVER A SAVAGE WORLD NEVER DID GENEROUS ROME SO PLEASE HERSELF IN THE VIEW OF LAW AND ORDER ESTABLISHED BY HER VICTORIOUS ARMS AS THE SCOTS NOW REJOICED IN COMMUNICATING THEIR BARBAROUS ZEAL AND THEOLOGICAL FERVOR TO THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS
FAMILIAR EVEN TO BUFFOONERY WITH THE MEANEST SENTINEL HE NEVER LOST HIS AUTHORITY
HE GATHERED FOLLOWERS IN HOLLAND AND THE NORTH OF GERMANY WHOM HIS GREAT REPUTATION ALLURED TO HIM
AND SEEMING EITHER TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER OR YIELD TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SOLDIERS COULD SECRETLY PAVE THE WAY FOR HIS FUTURE GREATNESS
526 WHITLOCKE P
AND HIS VERSES ARE ONLY KNOWN TO BE SUCH BY THE RHYME WHICH TERMINATES THEM
NOT TO MENTION WHAT SOME WRITERS RELATE THAT BEFORE THE SENTENCE WAS PRONOUNCED AGAINST HIM WILLIAMS WAS OFFERED A PARDON UPON HIS SUBMISSION WHICH HE REFUSED TO MAKE
EVERARD A DISBANDED SOLDIER HAVING PREACHED THAT THE TIME WAS NOW COME WHEN THE COMMUNITY OF GOODS WOULD BE RENEWED AMONG CHRISTIANS LED OUT HIS FOLLOWERS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND
THE LAST ORDERS OF THE PARLIAMENT SO ENTIRELY STRIPPED HIM OF HIS ARMY THAT THERE REMAINED NOT WITH HIM ABOVE A HUNDRED HORSE
A GREAT RELUCTANCE TO ASSEMBLE PARLIAMENTS MUST BE EXPECTED IN THE KING WHERE THESE ASSEMBLIES AS OF LATE ESTABLISH IT AS A MAXIM TO CARRY THEIR SCRUTINY INTO EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT
AND THAT WAS THE FERVOR OF PIETY AND THE RHETORIC HOWEVER BARBAROUS OF RELIGIOUS LECTURES AND DISCOURSES
AND THE ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS INSISTED ON AS THEY HAD BEEN FRAMED DURING THE GREATEST ARDOR OF THE CONTEST AMOUNTED RATHER TO ANNIHILATION THAN A LIMITATION OF MONARCHY
HE APPREHENDED AS MANY AS HE COULD OF THE PROSCRIBED PERSONS WHOM HE SENT TO THE TOWER
AND THE ORDERS WERE INSTANTLY OBEYED
SUCH WAS THE SITUATION OF MONTROSE THAT VERY GOOD OR VERY ILL FORTUNE WAS EQUALLY DESTRUCTIVE TO HIM AND DIMINISHED HIS ARMY
246
BOTH THESE OFFICERS WERE INCLINED TO THE KING'S SERVICE AND IT IS PRETENDED THAT CROMWELL WAS OBLIGED TO HURRY THE SOLDIERS ON BOARD IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE EXECUTION OF A CONSPIRACY WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED AMONG THEM IN FAVOR OF THE EXILED FAMILY THE ILL SUCCESS OF THIS ENTERPRISE MAY JUSTLY BE ASCRIBED AS MUCH TO THE INJUDICIOUS SCHEMES OF THE PROTECTOR WHO PLANNED IT AS TO THE BAD EXECUTION OF THE OFFICERS BY WHOM IT WAS CONDUCTED
1642 WHEN TWO NAMES SO SACRED IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION AS THOSE OF KING AND PARLIAMENT WERE PLACED IN OPPOSITION NO WONDER THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR CHOICE AND WERE AGITATED WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ANIMOSITIES AND FACTIONS
CROMWELL HAVING BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN THE WAR OF THE SWORD TOOK UP THE PEN AGAINST THE SCOTTISH ECCLESIASTICS
DRAGGED HIM FROM THE TABLE
THE PROTECTOR KNOWING THAT THE OTHER PROVINCES WOULD NOT BE INDUCED TO MAKE SUCH A CONCESSION WAS SATISFIED WITH THIS SECURITY
THE EARL OF SEAFORTH AT THE HEAD OF THE GARRISON OF INVERNESS WHO WERE VETERAN SOLDIERS JOINED TO FIVE THOUSAND NEW LEVIED TROOPS OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES PRESSED THE ROYALISTS ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THREATENED THEM WITH INEVITABLE DESTRUCTION
HAMILTON LONG FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES ALL SUFFUSED IN TEARS AND PROGNOSTICATED THAT IN THIS SHORT SALUTATION HE HAD GIVEN THE LAST ADIEU TO HIS SOVEREIGN AND HIS FRIEND
OVERTON GOVERNOR OF HULL HAD DECLARED HIS RESOLUTION TO KEEP POSSESSION OF THAT FORTRESS TILL THE COMING OF KING JESUS BUT WHEN ALURED PRODUCED THE AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT FOR HIS DELIVERING THE PLACE TO COLONEL FAIRFAX HE THOUGHT PROPER TO COMPLY
AND IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT HE MIGHT BELIEVE IT AS MANY OTHERS DID THE MOST MERITORIOUS ACTION THAT HE COULD PERFORM
NOR WAS THEIR ZEAL MUCH BETTER GUIDED BY REASON AND SOUND POLICY
AS THE BISHOPS WERE ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO THE COURT IT IS EVIDENT THAT ALL THE LORDS OF ARTICLES BY NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE DEPENDED ON THE KING'S NOMINATION
218
SEE NOTE Y AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
AND SO MUCH WAS HE BELOVED AMONG THEM THAT ABOVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED IN A FEW DAYS
HIS PROSE WRITINGS DISAGREEABLE THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER DEFECTIVE IN GENIUS
BECAUSE IT INCREASED HIS NECESSITIES AND RENDERED HIM STILL MORE DEPENDENT ON THE PARLIAMENT WHO HAD BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY SHOWN ON WHAT TERMS THEY WOULD ASSIST HIM
BUT THE ZEAL OF THE SCOTS AS IS USUAL AMONG RELIGIOUS SECTS WAS VERY FEEBLE WHEN NOT STIMULATED EITHER BY FACTION OR BY INTEREST
LIFE OF CLARENDON VOL
THE KING CAME TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS
INCITED BY THE APPEARANCES OF RELIGION NEGLIGENT OF THE DUTIES OF MORALITY
SIR RICHARD GRANVILLE HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF ILL USED BY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK IN A LAWSUIT
AND AT NOTTINGHAM HE ERECTED HIS ROYAL STANDARD THE OPEN SIGNAL OF DISCORD AND CIVIL WAR THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM
HE RAISED A PERSON FROM THE DEAD HE WAS MINISTERED UNTO BY WOMEN HE ENTERED BRISTOL MOUNTED ON A HORSE I SUPPOSE FROM THE DIFFICULTY IN THAT PLACE OF FINDING AN ASS HIS DISCIPLES SPREAD THEIR GARMENTS BEFORE HIM AND CRIED HOSANNA TO THE HIGHEST
A PREROGATIVE WHICH INVESTED HIM WITH THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY EVEN IN MATTERS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE SO FAR WAS LAUDABLE
BUT THOUGH THE MIDDLE DIVISION HAD ALREADY MOUNTED THE WALL SO GREAT WAS THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE GROUND AND SO BRAVE THE DEFENCE OF THE GARRISON THAT IN THE END THE ASSAILANTS WERE REPULSED WITH A CONSIDERABLE LOSS BOTH OF OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS
THEY HAVE TAKEN FROM US--WHAT SHALL I SAY
AND AN HISTORIAN MENTIONS THIS BOUNTY AS AN INSTANCE OF HIS LOVE OF LITERATURE HE INTENDED TO HAVE ERECTED A COLLEGE AT DURHAM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES
THE STORY TOLD OF SIR ANTHONY ASHLEY COOPER BY MR LOCKE HAS NOT ANY APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1365
BUT CHARLES'S COMMAND OF HIMSELF PROCEEDED ENTIRELY FROM THE GRAVITY AND COMPOSURE OF HIS TEMPER
THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN GENIUS AND CAPACITY OF ALL KINDS FREED FROM THE RESTRAINT OF AUTHORITY AND NOURISHED BY UNBOUNDED HOPES AND PROJECTS BEGAN TO EXERT THEMSELVES AND BE DISTINGUISHED BY THE PUBLIC
BESIDES SUMMONING SOME OFFICERS TO ANSWER FOR THIS ATTEMPT THEY IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT THE PETITION TENDED TO INTRODUCE MUTINY TO PUT CONDITIONS UPON THE PARLIAMENT AND TO OBSTRUCT THE RELIEF OF IRELAND
WINDHAM BEFORE HE RECEIVED THE KING ASKED LEAVE TO INTRUST THE IMPORTANT SECRET TO HIS MOTHER HIS WIFE AND FOUR SERVANTS ON WHOSE FIDELITY HE COULD RELY
12 FOOTNOTE 18
HE HAD IN IRELAND PROCLAIMED THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS REBELS AND TRAITORS EVEN BEFORE THE KING HAD ISSUED ANY SUCH DECLARATION AGAINST THEM IN ENGLAND AND HE HAD EVER DISSUADED HIS MASTER AGAINST THE LATE TREATY AND SUSPENSION OF ARMS WHICH HE REGARDED AS DANGEROUS AND DISHONORABLE
AFTER SUFFERING THE UTMOST EXTREMITIES OF FAMINE AFTER FEEDING ON THE VILEST ALIMENTS THE GARRISON DESIRED AT LAST TO CAPITULATE

THE WHOLE WORLD STOOD AMAZED AT THIS IMPORTANT ACCUSATION SO SUDDENLY ENTERED UPON WITHOUT CONCERT DELIBERATION OR REFLECTION
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE ENTERPRISE OF GLOUCESTER THE ROYAL GARRISONS HAD REACHED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ONE END OF THE KINGDOM TO THE OTHER AND HAD OCCUPIED A GREATER EXTENT OF GROUND THAN THOSE OF THE PARLIAMENT
THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED
THE ENGLISH LONG ACCUSTOMED TO A MILD ADMINISTRATION AND UNACQUAINTED WITH DISSIMULATION COULD NOT CONFORM THEIR SPEECH AND COUNTENANCE TO THE PRESENT NECESSITY OR PRETEND ATTACHMENT TO A FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY GENERALLY REGARDED WITH SUCH VIOLENT ABHORRENCE
AND BEING UNCERTAIN WHAT ISSUE MIGHT ATTEND THESE MEASURES WAS DESIROUS OF EVADING THE PROPOSAL
THE THREE GREAT MONARCHIES OF EUROPE WERE AT THIS TIME RULED BY YOUNG PRINCES PHILIP LOUIS AND CHARLES WHO WERE NEARLY OF THE SAME AGE AND WHO HAD RESIGNED THE GOVERNMENT OF THEMSELVES AND OF THEIR KINGDOMS TO THEIR CREATURES AND MINISTERS OLIVAREZ RICHELIEU AND BUCKINGHAM
AND ENGLAND DURING THEIR REIGNS HAD BEEN IN A MANNER OVERLOOKED IN THE GENERAL SYSTEM OF EUROPE
METHODS SUPPORTED BY PRECEDENT BUT ALWAYS INVIDIOUS EVEN IN TIMES MORE SUBMISSIVE AND COMPLIANT
A MEASURE WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN TAKEN IN CASES OF SUDDEN EMERGENCY BUT WHICH AT PRESENT COULD SERVE TO LITTLE PURPOSE
SIR JOHN GRANVILLE WHO HAD A COMMISSION FROM THE KING APPLIED TO MORRICE FOR ACCESS TO THE GENERAL
POSTMASTERS BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD WERE IN HIS PAY
AND BEING ALWAYS FOUNDED ON OPINION NOT ON FORCE IT IS DANGEROUS TO WEAKEN BY THESE SPECULATIONS THE REVERENCE WHICH THE MULTITUDE OWE TO AUTHORITY AND TO INSTRUCT THEM BEFOREHAND THAT THE CASE CAN EVER HAPPEN WHEN THEY MAY BE FREED FROM THEIR DUTY OF ALLEGIANCE
AND THAT NONE BE CALLED TO MAKE ANSWER OR TAKE SUCH OATH OR TO GIVE ATTENDANCE OR BE CONFINED OR OTHERWAYS MOLESTED OR DISQUIETED CONCERNING THE SAME OR FOR REFUSAL THEREOF
THE EARL OF ARGYLE THOUGH HE LONG SEEMED TO TEMPORIZE HAD AT LAST EMBRACED THE COVENANT
684 691
WHEN THESE TWO ADMIRALS WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER AND PREPARING FOR BATTLE A FURIOUS STORM ATTACKED THEM
THE MEMBERS WHO HAD WITHDRAWN FROM TERROR OF THE ARMY RETURNED
HE WAS SUDDENLY AWAKED WITH THE NOISE OF FIRING

THAT ARTFUL POLITICIAN AS WELL AS THE LEADERS OF ALL PARTIES PAID COURT TO THE KING
IT MAY BE WORTHY OF NOTICE THAT NO SOONER WAS THE SESSION ENDED THAN THIS MAN SO JUSTLY OBNOXIOUS TO BOTH HOUSES RECEIVED A PARDON AND WAS PROMOTED TO A LIVING OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE SOME YEARS AFTER HE WAS RAISED TO THE SEE OF ST ASAPH
PRUDENT MEN LIKEWISE WERE SENSIBLE OF THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION WHICH WAS HANGING OVER THE NATION FROM THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND SAW NO RESOURCE OR SAFETY BUT IN GIVING SUPPORT TO THE DECLINING AUTHORITY OF THE KING
BUT AS THESE LIMITATIONS WERE NOT REGULARLY FIXED DURING THE AGE OF CHARLES NOR AT ANY TIME BEFORE SO WAS THIS LIBERTY TOTALLY UNKNOWN AND WAS GENERALLY DEEMED AS WELL AS RELIGIOUS TOLERATION INCOMPATIBLE WITH ALL GOOD GOVERNMENT
WHEN THE KING DISEMBARKED AT DOVER HE WAS MET BY THE GENERAL WHOM HE CORDIALLY EMBRACED
AND INTRUDING INTO THE PLACE OF LECTURES DECLAIMED AGAINST HUMAN LEARNING AND CHALLENGED THE MOST KNOWING OF THEM TO PROVE THAT THEIR CALLING WAS FROM CHRIST
THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PRESENT INTENTIONS OF THE RULING PARTY THEY MUST UNAVOIDABLY BE ENGAGED IN A WAR WITH ENGLAND AND MUST ACCEPT THE ASSISTANCE OF THE KING'S FRIENDS OF ALL PARTIES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AGAINST A POWER SO MUCH SUPERIOR
THESE THEY MADE PRISONERS
IN ALL RELIGIOUS SPECULATIONS FOR FOLLY AND EXTRAVAGANCE
WHEN THIS RESOLUTION WAS KNOWN THE HOUSE OF PEERS WHOSE COMPLIANT BEHAVIOR ENTITLED THEM TO SOME AUTHORITY WITH HIM ENDEAVORED TO INTERPOSE AND THEY PETITIONED HIM THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THE PARLIAMENT TO SIT SOME TIME LONGER
THE PRIVATE SOLDIERS SEIZED WITH THE SAME SPIRIT EMPLOYED THEIR VACANT HOURS IN PRAYER IN PERUSING THE HOLY SCRIPTURES IN GHOSTLY CONFERENCES WHERE THEY COMPARED THE PROGRESS OF THEIR IN GRACE AND MUTUALLY STIMULATED EACH OTHER TO FURTHER ADVANCES IN THE GREAT WORK OF THEIR SALVATION
THE TREASURERS THE EARL OF MARLBOROUGH THE EARL OF PORTLAND JUXON BISHOP OF LONDON AND LORD COTTINGTON
THAT NEITHER THE YOUNG PRINCE NOR ANY OF HIS FAMILY SHOULD EVER BE INVESTED WITH THE DIGNITY OF STADTHOLDER
AND FINDING HIS MESSAGE INEFFECTUAL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS AND DESIRED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE COMMONS
THESE ARE THE WORDS
THESE ARE THE WORDS
AND THOUGH PRIVATEERS WITH ENGLISH COMMISSION COMMITTED DAILY DEPREDATIONS ON THE FRENCH COMMERCE MAZARINE WAS CONTENT IN HOPES OF A FORTUNATE ISSUE STILL TO SUBMIT TO THESE INDIGNITIES THURLOE VOL
THE AFFAIRS OF ENGLAND WERE IN SO GREAT DISORDER THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND THAT KINGDOM IN THE TREATY OR ADJUST MEASURES WITH A POWER WHICH WAS IN SUCH INCESSANT FLUCTUATION
HE SAVED HIMSELF BY FLIGHT
WE ARE ALSO SENT HITHER BY THE PEOPLE IN ORDER TO DELIVER THEIR JUST GRIEVANCES
AND HAVING MARCHED SIXTY MILES IN THE FACE OF AN ENEMY MUCH SUPERIOR WITHOUT STOPPING OR ALLOWING HIS SOLDIERS THE LEAST SLEEP OR REFRESHMENT HE AT LAST SECURED HIMSELF IN THE MOUNTAINS
THE WONDER ONLY IS WHY THE IRISH ACCEPTED OF A TREATY WHICH BOUND NOBODY AND WHICH THE VERY PERSON WHO CONCLUDES IT SEEMS TO CONFESS HE DOES NOT EXPECT TO BE RATIFIED
THEY THEREFORE ADHERED TO A POWER BY WHOSE SUCCESS THEY HOPED TO ACQUIRE RANK AND CONSIDERATION AND THE NEW SPLENDOR AND GLORY OF THE DUTCH COMMONWEALTH WHERE LIBERTY SO HAPPILY SUPPORTED INDUSTRY MADE THE COMMERCIAL PART AF THE NATION DESIRE TO SEE A LIKE FORM OF GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN ENGLAND
AND HE WENT SO FAR AS TO SHED TEARS OF GRIEF AND VEXATION ON THE OCCASION
333
AND FORETOLD WITHOUT THE HELP OF REVELATIONS THAT THE LORD HAD DELIVERED THEM INTO HIS HANDS
THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL
A NEW ODIUM LIKEWISE BY THESE REPRESENTATIONS WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE THROWN UPON BUCKINGHAM
HIS ANNUAL EXPENSES AT TWO MILLIONS TWO HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY POUNDS
NO LESS ACCEPTABLE WAS HIS AUTHORITY TO THE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS
V HAPPY FUTURE STATE OF ENGLAND DR DAVENANT HAS TOLD US FROM THE REGISTERS OF THE MINT THAT BETWEEN 1558 AND 1659 THERE HAD BEEN COINED NINETEEN MILLIONS EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY-TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX POUNDS IN GOLD AND SILVER
MANY DISORDERS IN ENGLAND IT BEHOVED HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMPOSE
HE WAS SENT TO THE TOWER WHERE HE ENDURED ABOVE TWO YEARS ALL THE RIGORS OF POVERTY AND CONFINEMENT
P 158 159 ETC
LET THE PUBLIC NECESSITIES BE FULLY SUPPLIED
AND TILL CORRECTED THEY MAY REFUSE THE MOST NECESSARY SUPPLIES TO THEIR INDIGENT SOVEREIGN
THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY
HE WAS NOW LODGED IN A PLACE REMOVED FROM HIS PARTISANS AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE ARMY WHENCE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DELIVER HIM EITHER BY FORCE OR ARTIFICE
GRANVILLE THOUGH IMPORTUNATELY URGED TWICE REFUSED TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE TO ANY BUT MONK HIMSELF

THEY VOTED A RENUNCIATION OF ALL TITLE IN CHARLES STUART OR ANY OF HIS FAMILY
THESE GENERAL COMMITTEES WHICH WERE A KIND OF INQUISITORIAL COURTS HAD NOT THEN BEEN ESTABLISHED
SEE NALSON VOL
BUT THE IMPATIENCE OF THE CITY LOST THEM ALL THE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR CAUTIOUS MEASURES
TO HIS PROFESSIONS OF LENITY THEY OPPOSED DECLARATIONS OF RIGOR
THE ELECTIONS OF THIS PARLIAMENT WERE CONDUCTED WITH PERFECT FREEDOM
HISTORY VOL
416 ETC
THEY INSISTED THAT IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO SEE PUT IN EXECUTION A MEASURE SO NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LATE WARS AND BLOODSHED AND THE PRESENT FACTIONS THE POWER OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER IN ANY PERIOD APPEARED SO FORMIDABLE TO THE NEIGHBORING KINGDOMS AS IT DID AT THIS TIME IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
WHERE EVERY MAN IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ENTIRE FREEDOM WITHOUT FEAR OF FUTURE PUNISHMENT OR INQUIRY OF PROPOSING ANY EXPEDIENT QUESTIONING ANY OPINION OR SUPPORTING ANY ARGUMENT SIR GEORGE RATCLIFFE THE EARL'S INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANT WAS ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON SENT FOR FROM IRELAND AND COMMITTED TO CLOSE CUSTODY
WHICH IS FALSE AND WHICH WAS NEVER SAID BY BRISTOL
THIS SHOWS THAT LOWER NATURES BEING BACKED BY HIGHER INCREASE IN COURAGE AND STRENGTH
AT THE REQUEST OF THE PARLIAMENT CHARLES INSTEAD OF THE PATENTS DURING PLEASURE GAVE ALL THE JUDGES PATENTS DURING THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR A CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TOWARDS SECURING THEIR INDEPENDENCY AND BARRING THE ENTRANCE OF ARBITRARY POWER INTO THE ORDINARY COURTS OF JUDICATURE
AND NONE BUT REBELS TO GOD AND TRAITORS TO THEIR COUNTRY IT WAS THOUGHT WOULD WITHDRAW THEMSELVES FROM SO SALUTARY AND SO PIOUS A COMBINATION
CHARLES MEANWHILE CONTINUED STILL TO LEVY THIS DUTY BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY AND THE NATION WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT EXERTION OF ROYAL POWER THAT NO SCRUPLE WAS AT FIRST ENTERTAINED OF SUBMITTING TO IT
779 780
NO CESSATION OF ARMS HAD AS YET BEEN AGREED TO DURING THE TREATY AT RIPPON
IT IS VERY CURIOUS AND FULL OF THE SAME OBSCURITY CONFUSION EMBARRASSMENT AND ABSURDITY WHICH APPEAR IN ALMOST ALL OLIVER'S PRODUCTIONS
AND IT WAS ASSERTED THAT BY LAW THIS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT REASON FOR REFUSING BAIL OR RELEASEMENT TO THE PRISONERS
THE FANATICISM WHICH PREVAILED BEING SO FULL OF SOUR AND ANGRY PRINCIPLES AND SO OVERCHARGED WITH VARIOUS ANTIPATHIES HAD ACQUIRED A NEW OBJECT OF ABHORRENCE
THE ARMINIANS FINDING MORE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE SUPERSTITIOUS SPIRIT OF THE CHURCH THAN FROM THE FANATICISM OF THE PURITANS GRADUALLY INCORPORATED THEMSELVES WITH THE FORMER
AND THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WAS NEVER OBSERVED TO BE FROM THE BEGINNING SO FULL AND NUMEROUS
MEANWHILE THEY CONTINUED TO THUNDER AGAINST THE VIOLATION OF PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGES AND BY THEIR VIOLENT OUTCRIES TO INFLAME THE WHOLE NATION
THEN STAMPING WITH HIS FOOT WHICH WAS A SIGNAL FOR THE SOLDIERS TO ENTER FOR SHAME SAID HE TO THE PARLIAMENT GET YOU GONE
BUT THE FORMER SOON DIED
500
500
346
AND UPON THE WHOLE HIS CHARACTER DOES NOT APPEAR MORE EXTRAORDINARY AND UNUSUAL BY THE MIXTURE OF SO MUCH ABSURDITY WITH SO MUCH PENETRATION THAN BY HIS TEMPERING SUCH VIOLENT AMBITION AND SUCH ENRAGED FANATICISM WITH SO MUCH REGARD TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY
CHARLES WAS IN A VERY DISTRESSED CONDITION
AND HE THREATENING EXCOMMUNICATION THEY BASTED HIM FOR HIS LABOR KEPT HIM PRISONER AND SENT A PARTY OF SIXTY WHO ROUTED THE REST OF THE CLERGY BRUISED THEIR BODIES SORELY TOOK ALL THEIR BAGGAGE AND TWELVE HORSES
WHERE THERE ARE FOUND PARTS AND JUDGMENT IN EVERY DISCOURSE AND OPINION
AND BETWEEN DESPAIR AND ASTONISHMENT GAVE WAY TO THOSE MEASURES WHICH THEY FOUND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM BY THEIR UTMOST EFFORTS TO WITHSTAND
AND THEY ISSUED ORDERS THAT THE ARMY SHOULD ADVANCE NO NEARER TO LONDON
YET HE ALONE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE MIXING MODESTY AND HUMILITY WITH FIRMNESS AND VIGOR MADE SUCH A DEFENCE THAT THE COMMONS SAW IT IMPOSSIBLE BY A LEGAL PROSECUTION EVER TO OBTAIN A SENTENCE AGAINST HIM
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT ABSURDITY IF HE HAD ALREADY FIXED A DIFFERENT CANAL BY WHICH ON VERY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS HE PURPOSED TO ESTABLISH A PEACE ON THE 22D OF OCTOBER AS HIS DISTRESSES MULTIPLY HE SOMEWHAT ENLARGES THE CONDITIONS THOUGH THEY STILL FALL SHORT OF GLAMORGAN'S
CHARLES IN THE AGONY OF GRIEF SHAME AND REMORSE FOR STRAFFORD'S DOOM PERCEIVED NOT THAT THIS OTHER BILL WAS OF STILL MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCE TO HIS AUTHORITY AND RENDERED THE POWER OF HIS ENEMIES PERPETUAL AS IT WAS ALREADY UNCONTROLLABLE IN COMPARISON OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER BY WHICH HE DEEMED HIMSELF AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS FRIEND'S MURDER THIS CONCESSION MADE NO FIGURE IN HIS EYES 7 A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF IT LESSEN OUR IDEA OF HIS RESOLUTION OR PENETRATION SERVES TO PROVE THE INTEGRITY OF HIS HEART AND THE GOODNESS OF HIS DISPOSITION
THE TERROR OF THEIR AUTHORITY THEY EXTENDED OVER THE WHOLE NATION
THOSE WITH REGARD TO PRIVILEGES OF PARLIAMENT TO THE PROPERTY OF THE SUBJECT AND TO RELIGION CLARENDON VOL
MORE FRUIT FOWLER OF EAST HADLEY
AND EVEN THE SMALLEST INDISCRETION OF HIS FRIENDS MIGHT PROVE FATAL
HE DID AS HE PROPOSED
IF ALL THIS BE NOT FORCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING
THE GREAT NECESSITIES TO WHICH THE KING WAS REDUCED
BUT TO BE THE VICTIM OF THE FRIVOLOUS GALLANTRY OF A FAVORITE AND OF HIS BOYISH CAPRICES SEEMED THE OBJECT OF PECULIAR INDIGNATION
YET WOULD NOT THE GENERAL DECLARE OTHERWISE THAN BY HIS ACTIONS THAT HE HAD ADOPTED THE KING'S INTERESTS

FLATTERING HIMSELF PROBABLY IN THIS EXTREMITY OF DISTRESS THAT AS NEITHER HIS WILL CONSENTED TO THE DEED NOR WAS HIS HAND IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED IN IT HE WAS THE MORE FREE FROM ALL THE GUILT WHICH ATTENDED IT
FIELDING THEREFORE WAS CONTENTED TO YIELD THE TOWN ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BRING OFF ALL THE GARRISON WITH THE HONORS OF WAR AND DELIVER UP DESERTERS
AND THE DISTINCTION GRADUALLY BECAME QUITE UNIFORM AND REGULAR
AND WHICH IF ADMITTED DESTROYED ENTIRELY THE VALIDITY OF ALL SUCH STATUTES
THE COMMITTEE BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE THAT REMONSTRANCE WHICH HAS BECOME SO MEMORABLE AND WHICH WAS SOON AFTERWARDS ATTENDED WITH SUCH IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES
THE KING HIMSELF SO HIGHLY VALUED HIM THAT EITHER FROM GENEROSITY OR POLICY HE INTENDED TO HAVE SENT HIM HIS OWN SURGEON TO ASSIST AT HIS CURE 13 SEE NOTE M AT THE END OF THE VOLUME
THE MAXIMS OF THAT PRINCE HAD ALWAYS LED HIM TO GIVE A REASONABLE INDULGENCE TO THE CATHOLICS THROUGHOUT ALL HIS DOMINIONS
AND THE NEW GENERAL WAS DIRECTED TO EMPLOY SOME OTHER OFFICER IN THAT SERVICE
AND SUCH WAS THE UNHAPPY AND DISTRACTED CONDITION TO WHICH IT HAD REDUCED KING AND PEOPLE
THE WILD ENTHUSIASM TOGETHER WITH VALOR AND DISCIPLINE STILL PROPAGATED ITSELF
THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS
IF THEY SHALL ATTEMPT BY DISCOUNTENANCING THE PRESENT LAWS TO LOOSEN THE BANDS OF GOVERNMENT THAT ALL DISORDER AND CONFUSION MAY BREAK IN UPON US
694
NO DIRECTIONS OR INTELLIGENCE WERE GIVEN TO CONDUCT THE OFFICERS IN THEN ENTERPRISE
SEAFORTH'S ARMY DISPERSED OF ITSELF AT THE VERY TERROR OF HIS NAME
THE FOLLOWING WAS A FAVORITE TEXT AMONG THE ENTHUSIASTS OF THAT AGE
NO ONE COULD CONJECTURE WHETHER HE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE
HIS FIDELITY TO THE KING WAS UNSHAKEN
BY A CONCURRENCE OF ACCIDENTS THIS MAN LABORED UNDER THE SEVERE HATRED OF ALL THE THREE NATIONS WHICH COMPOSED THE BRITISH MONARCHY
AND HE HAS EVEN VENTURED TO TELL ME THAT IT NEVER WOULD BE WELL WITH ENGLAND TILL I WERE MR MONTAGUE AND THERE WERE NE'ER A LORD OR PEER IN THE KINGDOM SO FULL WAS CROMWELL OF THESE REPUBLICAN PROJECTS THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HABITS OF PROFOUND DISSIMULATION HE COULD NOT SO CAREFULLY GUARD HIS EXPRESSIONS BUT THAT SOMETIMES HIS FAVORITE NOTIONS WOULD ESCAPE HIM
A CONDITION TOO RIGOROUS TO BE IMPOSED ON THE GREATEST HUMAN CAPACITY
BUT THAT IT EVER WAS AND STILL IS HIS MEANING TO ENJOY THEM AS A GIFT OF HIS PEOPLE
WE THE INHABITANTS MAGISTRATES OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS WITHIN THE GARRISON OF GLOUCESTER UNTO HIS MAJESTY'S GRACIOUS MESSAGE RETURN THIS HUMBLE ANSWER
474
A DEFENSIVE LEAGUE WAS MADE BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS
AND AS IT WAS THE FIRST RETURN WHICH HE MET WITH FOR HIS LATE BENEFICIAL CONCESSIONS AND FOR HIS SACRIFICES OF PREROGATIVE,--THE GREATEST BY FAR EVER MADE BY AN ENGLISH SOVEREIGN,--NOTHING COULD BE MORE THE OBJECT OF JUST AND NATURAL INDIGNATION
AND A NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT ATTENDED WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD RENDER A PROMISE SACRED AND OBLIGATORY WAS ENTERED INTO WITH THE SCOTS NEVER TO SUFFER ITS READMISSION
BUT ALL THESE PROMISING VIEWS HAD ALMOST BEEN BLASTED BY AN UNTOWARD ACCIDENT
INDEED I HAVE BUT ONE WORD MORE TO SAY TO YOU THOUGH IN THAT PERHAPS I SHALL SHOW MY WEAKNESS
THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO PLEAD THE ADVANCED SEASON AND THE URGENT OCCASION FOR SUPPLY
THE DENYING OF HIS COMMISSION TO GLAMORGAN IS ANOTHER INSTANCE WHICH HAS BEEN CITED
THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION JOINED TO HIS CHARACTER OF COURAGE AND INTEGRITY HAD PROCURED HIM THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF NORTHUMBERLAND CONWAY AND EVERY EMINENT PERSON OF EITHER SEX WHO RESIDED IN LONDON
IT IS STRANGE TOO THAT AN EXTREME NECESSITY WHICH IS ALWAYS APPARENT AND USUALLY COMES TO A SUDDEN CRISIS SHOULD NOW HAVE CONTINUED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FOR NEAR FOUR YEARS AND SHOULD HAVE REMAINED DURING SO LONG A TIME INVISIBLE TO THE WHOLE KINGDOM
ALL RECREATIONS WERE IN A MANNER SUSPENDED BY THE RIGID SEVERITY OF THE PRESBYTERIANS AND INDEPENDENTS
IN EFFECT THE IMPORTANT POWER OF THE SWORD WAS FOREVER RAVISHED FROM HIM AND HIS SUCCESSORS HE AGREED THAT ALL THE GREAT OFFICES DURING TWENTY YEARS SHOULD BE FILLED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT HE RELINQUISHED TO THEM THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND AND THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR THERE HE RENOUNCED THE POWER OF THE WARDS AND ACCEPTED OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR IN LIEU OF IT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE VALIDITY OF THEIR GREAT SEAL AND GAVE UP HIS OWN.[V HE ABANDONED THE POWER OF CREATING PEERS WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN
THEIR CONDUCT IS REGULATED BY THEIR UNDERSTANDING THEIR TEMPER AND THEIR PASSIONS
348
AND THE MOSAICAL LAW WAS INTENDED TO BE ESTABLISHED AS THE SOLE SYSTEM OF ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE OF ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY SCHEMES ADOPTED BY THESE LEGISLATORS THEY HAD NOT LEISURE TO FINISH ANY EXCEPT THAT WHICH ESTABLISHED THE LEGAL SOLEMNIZATION OF MARRIAGE BY THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE ALONE WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF THE CLERGY
THEIR INFLUENCE WHICH WAS BEFORE THOUGHT UNBOUNDED AMONG THE TROOPS SEEMED FROM THAT MOMENT TO BE TOTALLY ANNIHILATED
PRINCE RUPERT
BUT WHETHER IN THE PURSUIT OF THIS VIOLENT ENTERPRISE HE WAS ACTUATED BY PRIVATE AMBITION OR BY HONEST PREJUDICES DERIVED FROM THE FORMER EXORBITANT POWERS OF ROYALTY IT BELONGS NOT TO AN HISTORIAN OF THIS AGE SCARCELY EVEN TO AN INTIMATE FRIEND POSITIVELY TO DETERMINE
THAT UNHAPPY PEOPLE DISGUSTED WITH THE KING ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE VIOLENT DECLARATIONS AGAINST THEM AND THEIR RELIGION WHICH HAD BEEN EXTORTED BY THE SCOTS APPLIED TO THE KING OF SPAIN TO THE DUKE OF LORRAINE
MUCH MORE WHEN REGARDED AS A PREPARATIVE WHICH WAS SOON TO INTRODUCE INTO SCOTLAND ALL THE ABOMINATIONS OF POPERY
NO ONE COULD SUSPECT ANY AMBITION IN THE MAN WHO LABORED SO ZEALOUSLY TO RETAIN HIS GENERAL IN THAT HIGH OFFICE WHICH HE KNEW HE HIMSELF WAS ALONE ENTITLED TO FILL
AND THAT HIS MILD SPIRIT THUS TERMINATED ITS PRESENT COURSE BY AN ACT OF BENEVOLENCE TOWARDS HIS GREATEST ENEMIES
SOME MEN OF THE GREATEST PARTS AND MOST EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE NATION AT THIS TIME PRODUCED COULD NOT ENJOY ANY PEACE OF MIND BECAUSE OBLIGED TO HEAR PRAYERS OFFERED UP TO THE DIVINITY BY A PRIEST COVERED WITH A WHITE LINEN VESTMENT
ON HIS APPROACH HERTFORD WAS OBLIGED TO RETIRE INTO SHERBORNE CASTLE
ABOVE FIVE MILLIONS OF ACRES FORFEITED EITHER BY THE POPISH REBELS OR BY THE ADHERENTS OF THE KING WERE DIVIDED PARTLY AMONG THE ADVENTURERS WHO HAD ADVANCED MONEY TO THE PARLIAMENT PARTLY AMONG THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS WHO HAD ARREARS DUE TO THEM
AND BEING EXHAUSTED WITH CONTINUAL FATIGUE FOR SOME DAYS HE HAD RETIRED TO REST AFTER LEAVING ORDERS TO KEEP HIS FORCES UNDER ARMS
THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INDEED OF INFERIOR FORCE TO THE ENGLISH
NO GOVERNMENT AT THAT TIME APPEARED IN THE WORLD NOR IS PERHAPS TO BE FOUND IN THE RECORDS OF ANY HISTORY WHICH SUBSISTED WITHOUT THE MIXTURE OF SOME ARBITRARY AUTHORITY COMMITTED TO SOME MAGISTRATE
THE KING HAD PROMISED HIS SCOTTISH SUBJECTS THAT HE WOULD THIS SUMMER PAY THEM A VISIT IN ORDER TO SETTLE THEIR GOVERNMENT
AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS VALUE WAS NECESSARY TO ENTITLE ANY ONE TO A VOTE
FOR THAT BELIEVING HE SHOULD PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT HE HAD THERE TAKEN CARE TO EXPLAIN THEM WHEN THE KING WAS INFORMED OF THIS ASSASSINATION HE RECEIVED THE NEWS IN PUBLIC WITH AN UNMOVED AND UNDISTURBED COUNTENANCE
THOUGH THEIR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THAT NATION FOR WANT OF AN OCCASION TO EXERT ITSELF SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED IT WAS ONLY COMPOSED INTO A TEMPORARY AND DECEITFUL TRANQUILLITY THEIR INTERESTS BOTH WITH REGARD TO PROPERTY AND RELIGION SECRETLY STIMULATED THEM TO A REVOLT
516 517
AND OF OBTAINING FROM ENGLAND SOME SUPPLY OF CAVALRY IN WHICH HE WAS DEFICIENT
6 7 8 9
THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT IF THE RELIGIOUS RAGE WHICH HAS SEIZED THE MULTITUDE BE ALLOWED TO EVAPORATE THEY WILL QUICKLY RETURN TO THE ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENT
IN ANSWER TO THE KING'S PROPOSAL THAT HIS MAGAZINES TOWNS FORTS AND SHIPS SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIM THE PARLIAMENT REQUIRED THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THEY COULD CONFIDE IN THE NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS WHICH THEY FORMERLY SENT TO THE KING SHOWED THEIR INCLINATION TO ABOLISH MONARCHY
AND THOUGH THEY EXPRESSED NO DISSATISFACTION AGAINST SKIPPON WHO WAS APPOINTED COMMANDER THEY DISCOVERED MUCH STRONGER INCLINATION TO SERVE UNDER FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL SOME OFFICERS WHO WERE OF THE PRESBYTERIAN PARTY HAVING ENTERED INTO ENGAGEMENTS FOR THIS SERVICE COULD PREVAIL ON VERY FEW OF THE SOLDIERS TO ENLIST UNDER THEM
AND CHARLES HAVING THE SATISFACTION TO EXCITE BETWEEN MANCHESTER AND CROMWELL EQUAL ANIMOSITIES WITH THOSE WHICH FORMERLY TOOK PLACE BETWEEN ESSEX AND WALLER DISTRIBUTED HIS ARMY INTO WINTER QUARTERS
RESPECT WAS PAID TO THEM AS TO THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND
THE KING TOO SENSIBLE OF HIS UTTER INABILITY TO SUBDUE THE IRISH REBELS FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED IN THIS EXIGENCY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND DEPEND ON THEIR ASSISTANCE FOR SUPPLY
IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS FAMILY HE DISCOVERED A DISPOSITION TO ORDER AND ECONOMY
NOR ARE THEY IN GENERAL TO BE CONSIDERED AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING AS THE RINGLEADERS OF THE SEDITION WHICH WAS RAISED ON THEIR ACCOUNT
THE PRINCESS NOTWITHSTANDING HER TENDER YEARS SHOWED AN ADVANCED JUDGMENT
AND THE ENGLISH OF ALL NATIONS IN EUROPE WERE THE LEAST ACCUSTOMED TO TAXES
THESE HE SOON THREW INTO DISORDER

124 BURCHET'S NAVAL HISTORY
THE BISHOP MOUNTING THE PULPIT IN ORDER TO APPEASE THE POPULACE HAD A STOOL THROWN AT HIM
BESIDES THAT THE PLAYERS WERE OFTEN PAPISTS AND DESPERATELY WICKED

FROM 1638 TO 1657 THE COINAGE AMOUNTED TO SEVEN MILLIONS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-ONE POUNDS.[V JOURNAL 7TH APRIL 1659
THAT GENERAL HAVING OBLIGED PRINCE MAURICE TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF LYME HAVING TAKEN WEYMOUTH AND TAUNTON ADVANCED STILL IN HIS CONQUESTS AND MET WITH NO EQUAL OPPOSITION
THE PORTERS FURTHER DESIRED THAT JUSTICE MIGHT BE DONE UPON OFFENDERS AS THE ATROCIOUSNESS OF THEIR CRIMES HAD DESERVED
AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD CONCURRED IN SUCH SENTENCES WERE VOTED TO BE LIABLE TO THE PENALTIES OF LAW NO MINISTER OF THE KING NO MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL BUT FOUND HIMSELF EXPOSED BY THIS DECISION
Y 688
AND DURING THESE DISORDERS IT IS BY THE SALUTARY EXERCISE ALONE OF THIS DISCRETIONARY POWER THAT REBELLIONS AND CIVIL WARS CAN BE PREVENTED
AND NO SURPRISE OR RELUCTANCE WAS DISCOVERED ON THE OCCASION
THAT IT COULD BE PROVED AS WELL BY THE EVIDENCE OF ALL THE KING'S MINISTERS AS BY THE KNOWN DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES THAT THE INTENTION NEVER WAS TO LAND THE IRISH ARMY IN ENGLAND BUT IN SCOTLAND
THE PARLIAMENT TOO RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE THEIR DOMINION
AT EVERY NOISE WHICH SHE HEARD SHE EXCLAIMED THAT HER SON WAS MURDERED
BUT THIS SUBMISSION AVAILED HIM NOTHING
THE VIEW OF PAST CALAMITIES NO LONGER PRESENTED DISMAL PROGNOSTICS OF THE FUTURE
THE PARLIAMENT HAVING ADJOURNED ITSELF THE PROTECTOR DEPRIVED LAMBERT OF ALL HIS COMMISSIONS
EVEN MANY EXORBITANT CLAIMS IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION WOULD PROBABLY BE MADE AND MUST NECESSARILY BE COMPLIED WITH
OVERRUN EACH CORNER OF THE THREE NATIONS AND SUBDUE WITH EQUAL FACILITY BOTH THE RICHES OF THE SOUTH AND THE POVERTY OF THE NORTH
AND AFTER SOME TIME HE WAS CONTENTED TO COME OUT AN ORDINARY MAN AND RETURN TO HIS USUAL OCCUPATIONS
NOISE AND FURY CANT AND HYPOCRISY FORMED THE SOLE RHETORIC WHICH DURING THIS TUMULT OF VARIOUS PREJUDICES AND PASSIONS COULD BE HEARD OR ATTENDED TO
BUT HOW TO EFFECT THIS PROJECT WAS THE DIFFICULTY
BUT FINDING THAT THEY HAD IMBIBED THE SAME PREJUDICES WITH THE REST OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN AND WERE UNWILLINGLY EMPLOYED IN SUCH A SERVICE HE LAID THE CASE BEFORE THE HOUSE OF PEERS FOR THE KING'S AUTHORITY WAS NOW ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED
THEY TREAT OF LOVE WITHOUT MAKING US FEEL ANY TENDERNESS
AND INTRUSTED THE WHOLE MILITARY AUTHORITY TO A PERSON WHO THOUGH WELL INCLINED TO THEIR SERVICE WAS NO LONGER AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL
IN ORDER AS THEY SAID THAT IT MIGHT CALL TO REMEMBRANCE OUR SINS AND THE SINS OF OUR FOREFATHERS WHO PRETENDING TO CELEBRATE THE MEMORY OF CHRIST HAVE TURNED THIS FEAST INTO AN EXTREME FORGETFULNESS OF HIM BY GIVING LIBERTY TO CARNAL AND SENSUAL DELIGHTS RUSH
HIS HONOR HIS CONSCIENCE AS WELL AS HIS INTEREST HE BELIEVED TO BE INTIMATELY CONCERNED IN SUPPORTING PRELACY AND THE LITURGY 14 HE BEGGED THE COMMISSIONERS THEREFORE TO REMAIN SATISFIED WITH THE CONCESSIONS WHICH HE HAD MADE TO SCOTLAND
WALLER WHO WAS HIS RELATION WAS CARESSED BY HIM
ALL THESE PRAISES ARE UNANIMOUSLY ASCRIBED TO HIM BY HISTORIANS OF THE MOST OPPOSITE PARTIES
NEXT DAY THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HE WAS SHOT IN THE SHOULDER WITH A BRACE OF BULLETS AND THE BONE BROKEN
AS SOON AS THE REMONSTRANCE OF THE COMMONS WAS PUBLISHED THE KING DISPERSED AN ANSWER TO IT
THE OFFICERS APPLIED TO LENTHAL THE SPEAKER AND PROPOSED TO HIM THAT THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD RESUME THEIR SEATS
IT IS PRETENDED BY HISTORIANS FAVORABLE TO THE ROYAL CAUSE AND IS EVEN ASSERTED BY THE KING HIMSELF IN A DECLARATION THAT A MOST DISINGENUOUS OR RATHER CRIMINAL PRACTICE PREVAILED IN CONDUCTING MANY OF THESE ADDRESSES
255
255
AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA WHOM HE HAD ESPOUSED BY PROXY OBLIGED HIM TO DELAY BY REPEATED PROROGATIONS THEIR MEETING TILL THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE WHEN THEY ASSEMBLED AT WESTMINSTER FOR THE DESPATCH OF BUSINESS
NIGHT AND DAY THE MINISTERS HAD BEEN WRESTLING WITH THE LORD IN PRAYER AS THEY TERMED IT
AND FORESEEING THAT THE GOOD WILL OF THE ARMY UNDER HIS COMMAND MIGHT SOME TIME BE OF GREAT SERVICE TO HIM HE HAD WITH MUCH CARE AND SUCCESS CULTIVATED THEIR FRIENDSHIP
THE SPANISH INFANTRY ANCIENTLY SO FORMIDABLE HAD BEEN ANNIHILATED BY CONDE IN THE FIELDS OF ROCROY
AND IN THE EVENT IT HAS HITHERTO BEEN FOUND THAT THOUGH SOME SENSIBLE INCONVENIENCIES ARISE FROM THE MAXIM OF ADHERING STRICTLY TO LAW YET THE ADVANTAGES OVERBALANCE THEM AND SHOULD RENDER THE ENGLISH GRATEFUL TO THE MEMORY OF THEIR ANCESTORS WHO AFTER REPEATED CONTESTS AT LAST ESTABLISHED THAT NOBLE THOUGH DANGEROUS PRINCIPLE
SELFISH AIMS AND BIGOTRY CHIEFLY ENGROSSED THEIR ATTENTION

THE KING ON MUSTERING HIS ARMY FOUND IT AMOUNT TO TEN THOUSAND MEN
BUT THERE IS NOT THE LEAST SYMPTOM OF SUCH INTENTIONS
IT IS LIKELY THAT AS SOON AS RICHARD WAS DEPOSED HE FORESAW THAT WITHOUT SUCH AN EXPEDIENT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EVER TO BRING THE NATION TO A REGULAR SETTLEMENT
MORE BRAVERY AND ACTIVITY WERE HOPED FOR FROM THE GENEROUS SPIRIT OF THE NOBLES AND GENTRY THAN FROM THE BASE DISPOSITION OF THE MULTITUDE
SIBTHORPE AND COSINS TWO CLERGYMEN WHO FOR LIKE REASONS WERE NO LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE COMMONS HAD MET WITH LIKE FAVOR FROM THE KING
BUT WOULD THEY BE CONTENT WITH MODERATE ADVANTAGES IS IT NOT EVIDENT THAT BESIDES OTHER IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT MAY BE CONTINUED TILL THE GOVERNMENT BE ACCUSTOMED TO THE NEW TRACK AND EVERY PART BE RESTORED TO FULL HARMONY AND CONCORD
CROMWELL BY HIS IMPERIOUS CHARACTER RATHER THAN BY THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS SITUATION ACQUIRED AN ASCENDANT OVER THIS MAN
BESIDES A MORE STATELY STYLE WHICH CHARLES IN GENERAL AFFECTED TO THIS PARLIAMENT THAN TO THE LAST HE WENT SO FAR IN A MESSAGE AS TO THREATEN THE COMMONS THAT IF THEY DID NOT FURNISH HIM WITH SUPPLIES HE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TRY NEW COUNSELS THIS LANGUAGE WAS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR
TO GAIN THE PEOPLE'S FAVOR AND GOOD OPINION WAS THE CHIEF POINT ON BOTH SIDES
A FORMIDABLE BODY TWENTY THOUSAND STRONG AND DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO LAWS OR LIBERTY TO PURSUE WHATEVER MEASURES THEIR GENERALS SHOULD DICTATE TO THEM
A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
220 221 ETC
AND IT WAS TO THIS TURN OF MIND AS MUCH AS TO HIS COURAGE AND CAPACITY THAT HE OWED ALL HIS WONDERFUL SUCCESSES
513
DURING THE CONTEST OF THE TWO PARTIES THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HAD REMAINED A GREAT OBJECT OF INTRIGUE
THE KING'S ASSURANCES THEREFORE CAN PLAINLY RELATE ONLY TO THIS RECENT TRANSACTION
AND IN THE INTERVALS WITH THE APPROBATION OF THE COUNCIL TO BE AFTERWARDS RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT
PROVIDED THAT AFTER HIS DEMISE THESE PREROGATIVES SHOULD REVERT TO THE CROWN BUT THE PARLIAMENT ACTED ENTIRELY AS VICTORS AND ENEMIES
SO TRULY MEN THAT HAVE BEEN LED IN DARK PATHS THROUGH THE PROVIDENCE AND DISPENSATION OF GOD
260

FIXED HIS QUARTERS IN CAMBRIDGE
HIS FACILITY IN MAKING THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS
HAVING PURSUED THE ENEMY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AND DETACHED SOME TROOPS TO PREVENT THEIR RALLYING HE TURNED BACK UPON THE KING'S INFANTRY AND THREW THEM INTO THE UTMOST CONFUSION
TO LOSE BOTH HIS EARS ONE IN EACH PLACE
THE LAST PARLIAMENT WHICH ENDED WITH SUCH RIGOR AND VIOLENCE HAD YET AT FIRST COVERED THEIR INTENTIONS WITH GREATER APPEARANCE OF MODERATION THAN THIS PARLIAMENT HAD HITHERTO ASSUMED
NO SOONER WERE THE SCOTS MASTERS OF THE NORTHERN COUNTIES THAN THEY LAID ASIDE THEIR FIRST PROFESSIONS WHICH THEY HAD NOT INDEED MEANS TO SUPPORT OF PAYING FOR EVERY THING

CHARLES WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KINGDOM AND COULD NEITHER STAY IN HIS RETREAT NOR STIR A STEP FROM IT WITHOUT THE MOST IMMINENT DANGER
AND NIGHT CAME OPPORTUNELY TO SAVE THE ENGLISH FLEET
AND IN ORDER TO FORWARD LAUD'S SUPPOSED GOOD INTENTIONS AN OFFER WAS TWICE MADE HIM IN PRIVATE OF A CARDINAL'S HAT WHICH HE DECLINED ACCEPTING HIS ANSWER WAS AS HE SAYS HIMSELF THAT SOMETHING DWELT WITHIN HIM WHICH WOULD NOT SUFFER HIS COMPLIANCE TILL ROME WERE OTHER THAN IT IS MAY P
IT IS RIDICULOUS TO MENTION THE JUSTIFICATION WHICH CHARLES II
THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM
AND IT SEEMS UNREASONABLE TO JUDGE OF THE MEASURES EMBRACED DURING ONE PERIOD BY THE MAXIMS WHICH PREVAIL IN ANOTHER
THE SECRETARIES OF STATE LORD CONWAY SIR ALBERTUS MORETON COKE SIR HENRY VANE LORD FALKLAND LORD DIGBY AND SIR EDWARD NICHOLAS
NOR WAS HE INSENSIBLE TO THE PLEASURES EITHER OF SOCIETY OR OF LOVE
QUALIFIED ONLY BY HIS NOISY PERTINACIOUS OBSTINACY TO ACQUIRE AN ASCENDANT IN PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES
OF ALL SPECIES OF GUILT THE LAW OF ENGLAND HAD WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS EXACTNESS DEFINED THAT OF TREASON
AND NOTHING COULD BE SUPPOSED TO COUNTERBALANCE HIS NATURAL PROPENSITY TO THAT MEASURE EXCEPT THE VIEWS OF HIS OWN ELEVATION AND THE PROSPECT OF USURPING THE SAME GRANDEUR AND AUTHORITY WHICH HAD BEEN ASSUMED BY CROMWELL
THE EARL OF LEICESTER IN 1585 HAD ONCE TEN PROXIES D'EWES P
NOR WAS THEIR RIGHT TO IT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONED TO BESTOW THE GREATER SOLEMNITY ON THIS IMPORTANT TRIAL SCAFFOLDS WERE ERECTED IN WESTMINSTER HALL
BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE HE SOON RENDERED HIMSELF THE FIRST IN THE STATE
IF I SAY I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU KNOWING THEIR MINDS TO BE SO I SHOULD NOT BE FAITHFUL IF I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU SO TO THE END YOU MAY REPORT IT TO THE PARLIAMENT
THIS MAN HAD NO SOONER BY SUPPLENESS AND INTRIGUE GOTTEN POSSESSION OF THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE FORMED AT ONCE THREE MIGHTY PROJECTS
V DR WALKER P
IN THE SECOND PLACE HIS DEPORTMENT AND CHARACTER IN COMMON LIFE WAS FREE FROM THAT VICE
TO CONFISCATE A MAN'S FORTUNE BESIDES ITS BEING A MOST ATROCIOUS ACT OF VIOLENCE EXPOSES THE MONARCH SO MUCH TO THE IMPUTATION OF AVARICE AND RAPACITY THAT IT WILL SELDOM BE ATTEMPTED IN ANY CIVILIZED GOVERNMENT

AND THE SEA WHICH HAD BEEN MUCH INFESTED BY PRIVATEERS FROM THESE ISLANDS WAS RENDERED SAFE TO THE ENGLISH COMMERCE
THE PROTECTOR SURPRISED AND ENRAGED AT THIS REFRACTORY SPIRIT IN THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HOWEVER HE HAD SO MUCH REASON TO EXPECT SENT FOR THEM TO THE PAINTED CHAMBER AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT AUTHORITY INVEIGHED AGAINST THEIR CONDUCT
THE PRESS FREED FROM ALL FEAR OR RESERVE SWARMED WITH PRODUCTIONS DANGEROUS BY THEIR SEDITIOUS ZEAL AND CALUMNY MORE THAN BY ANY ART OR ELOQUENCE OF COMPOSITION

BY THE SLENDER REVENUE OF THE CROWN NO KING CAN EVER ATTAIN SUCH INFLUENCE AS TO PROCURE A REPEAL OF THESE SALUTARY STATUTES

THE LEVYING OF THESE DUTIES AS FORMERLY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT AND EVEN INCREASING THEM AT PLEASURE WAS SUCH AN INCONGRUITY IN A FREE CONSTITUTION WHERE THE PEOPLE BY THEIR FUNDAMENTAL PRIVILEGES CANNOT BE TAXED BUT BY THEIR OWN CONSENT AS COULD NO LONGER BE ENDURED BY THESE JEALOUS PATRONS OF LIBERTY
SOMERSET AND DEVON AND MAKE AN ENTIRE CONQUEST OF CORNWALL
IT IS A TRADITION THAT ONE DAY SITTING AT TABLE THE PROTECTOR HAD A BOTTLE OF WINE BROUGHT HIM OF A KIND WHICH HE VALUED SO HIGHLY THAT HE MUST NEEDS OPEN THE BOTTLE HIMSELF
NEVER SURELY WAS A MORE SINGULAR ARMY ASSEMBLED THAN THAT WHICH WAS NOW SET ON FOOT BY THE PARLIAMENT
BUT THIS BARBAROUS AND ABSURD POLICY WHICH FROM AN IMPATIENCE OF ATTAINING IMMEDIATE SECURITY MUST HAVE DEPOPULATED ALL THE OTHER PROVINCES AND RENDERED THE ENGLISH ESTATES OF NO VALUE WAS SOON ABANDONED AS IMPRACTICABLE
HE PERSUADED THE GENERALS TO ENTER INTO THE SAME VIEWS

AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS
AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES

ORMOND WAS OBLIGED TO FLY AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF FORTUNATE TO HAVE ESCAPED SO VIGILANT AN ADMINISTRATION
THE SECRET REASON OF THEIR DISPLEASURE HOWEVER OBVIOUS THEY CAREFULLY CONCEALED
AS HE APPROACHED THE COMMUNION TABLE HE MADE MANY LOWLY REVERENCES
CROMWELL BEING NOW ENTIRELY MASTER OF THE PARLIAMENT AND FREE FROM ALL ANXIETY WITH REGARD TO THE CUSTODY OF THE KING'S PERSON APPLIED HIMSELF SERIOUSLY TO QUELL THOSE DISORDERS IN THE ARMY WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD SO ARTFULLY RAISED AND SO SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED AGAINST BOTH KING AND PARLIAMENT

GREAT WERE THE REJOICINGS AMONG THE SCOTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE HAPPY INSTRUMENTS OF EXTENDING THEIR MODE OF RELIGION AND DISSIPATING THAT PROFOUND DARKNESS IN WHICH THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS WERE INVOLVED

AND THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF SPEAKER FAIL ON LENTHAL A LAWYER OF SOME CHARACTER BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY QUALIFIED FOR SO HIGH AND DIFFICULT AN OFFICE CLARENDON VOL
THE TORRENT THEREFORE OF GENERAL AFFECTION RAN TO THE PARLIAMENT
AFTER HE HAD JOINED HIS TROOPS TO THE MAIN ARMY WITH WHOM FOR SOME TIME HE REMAINED UNITED ORMOND PASSED THE RIVER LIFFY AND TOOK POST AT RATHMINES TWO MILES FROM DUBLIN WITH A VIEW OF COMMENCING THE SIEGE OF THAT CITY
TRAMPLE TOO UPON THAT PARLIAMENT IN THEIR TURN AND SCORNFULLY EXPEL THEM AS SOON AS THEY GAVE HIM GROUND OF DISSATISFACTION
MANY PERSONS OF FAMILY AND DISTINCTION HAD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR ADHERED TO THE PARLIAMENT

THE KING ACCORDINGLY CAME TO THE HOUSE OF PEERS
BUT BEING BANISHED WITH THE OTHER ROYALISTS TO A DISTANCE FROM THAT CITY AND SEEING EVERY EVENT TURN OUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS ROYAL MASTER AND THREATEN HIM WITH A CATASTROPHE STILL MORE DIREFUL HE THOUGHT PROPER TO RETIRE INTO FRANCE WHERE HE JOINED THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCE OF WALES
FOR THOUGH AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT BE MADE TO RESTRAIN IT AND THE KING DOTH GIVE HIS CONSENT UNTO IT AS SAMSON WAS BOUND WITH HIS OWN CONSENT
THE SECLUDED MEMBERS ATTEMPTED BUT IN VAIN TO RESUME THEIR SEATS AMONG THEM
AND IT MAY WELL BE SAID WHAT NEED A NEW LAW TO CONFIRM AN OLD IF YOU REPOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE DECLARATIONS WHICH HIS MAJESTY MADE TO BOTH HOUSES THE TRUTH IS THE GREAT CHARTER AND THE OLD STATUTES WERE SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR IN FAVOR OF PERSONAL LIBERTY

AND BEING ADVISED BY DORSET TO BEHAVE WITH GREAT HUMILITY AND GREAT SUBMISSION TO THE PRIMATE THE MODESTY OF THEIR CARRIAGE THE INGENUITY OF THEIR APOLOGY WITH THE PATRONAGE OF THAT NOBLE LORD SAVED THEM FROM ANY SEVERER PUNISHMENT THAN A REPROOF AND ADMONITION WITH WHICH THEY WERE DISMISSED RUSH

CHARLES BORN IN 1630
THESE VERY GENERALS AT LEAST THE THREE LAST WERE SECRETLY THE AUTHORS OF ALL THE DISCONTENTS
HAVING MADE A BREACH HE ORDERED A GENERAL ASSAULT
HE MET WITH THE ENEMY COMMANDED BY MONK
THE KING HOWEVER WAS SO MINDFUL AS TO SEND HIM NOTWITHSTANDING HIS OWN DIFFICULTIES A PRESENT OF ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS
THE KING CIRCULATED PRIVY SEALS COUNTERSIGNED BY THE SPEAKERS OF BOTH HOUSES REQUIRING THE LOAN OF PARTICULAR SUMS FROM SUCH PERSONS AS LIVED WITHIN HIS QUARTERS NEITHER PARTY HAD AS YET GOT ABOVE THE PEDANTRY OF REPROACHING THEIR ANTAGONISTS WITH THESE ILLEGAL MEASURES
AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
BY THIS DEED THE AUTHORITY OF PROTECTOR WAS IN SOME PARTICULARS ENLARGED
THE MEN WITHOUT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE OF DUTY OR GOOD MANNERS IN A PERT SHRILL UNDISMAYED ACCENT SAID THAT THEY BROUGHT AN ANSWER FROM THE GODLY CITY OF GLOUCESTER
AND HE BEGGED THE KING'S PERMISSION TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF TO HIS GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND AT LEAST TO REMAIN AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMY IN YORKSHIRE
HE AGREED THAT THE PARLIAMENT SHOULD RETAIN DURING THE TERM OF TWENTY YEARS THE POWER OVER THE MILITIA AND ARMY AND THAT OF LEVYING WHAT MONEY THEY PLEASED FOR THEIR SUPPORT
AS THE SCOTS CONCURRED WITH THE ENGLISH IN IMPOSING SUCH SEVERE CONDITIONS ON THE KING THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION HE STILL REFUSED TO ACCEPT OF THEM IT IS CERTAIN THAT THEY DID NOT DESIRE HIS FREEDOM
AND NO FAULT WAS FOUND WITH HIS CONDUCT IN THIS PARTICULAR
IN A FORMER TRIAL WHICH WILLIAMS UNDERWENT FOR THESE WERE NOT THE FIRST THERE WAS MENTIONED IN COURT A STORY WHICH AS IT DISCOVERS THE GENIUS OF PARTIES MAY BE WORTH RELATING
THIS TERRIBLE COURT WHEN ASSEMBLED HAVING FIRST DECLARED THAT THEY FOUND NO DISTEMPERS IN THE ARMY BUT MANY GRIEVANCES UNDER WHICH IT LABORED IMMEDIATELY VOTED THE OFFERS OF THE PARLIAMENT UNSATISFACTORY
O LORD THOU KNOWEST HOW BUSY I MUST BE THIS DAY
THE COMMISSIONER TOO PROTESTED AGAINST THE COURT AS ILLEGALLY CONSTITUTED AND ELECTED
191 192
BUT COULD NOT OBTAIN THEIR REQUEST RUSH VOL
NOR COULD EVEN THE APPROACH OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY UNDER CROMWELL OBLIGE THE COVENANTERS TO CONSULT THEIR OWN SAFETY BY A CLOSE UNION WITH THE ROYALISTS
THE BOLDNESS OF HIS OPINIONS AND SENTIMENTS FORM A REMARKABLE CONTRAST TO THIS PART OF HIS CHARACTER
HERE THE MOST FAVORABLE EVENT HAPPENED TO QUICKEN AND ENCOURAGE THEIR ADVANCE
THAT IT WAS NOWISE PROBABLE SUCH A DESPERATE COUNSEL WOULD BE OPENLY DELIVERED AT THE BOARD AND BEFORE NORTHUMBERLAND A PERSON OF THAT HIGH RANK AND WHOSE ATTACHMENTS TO THE COURT WERE SO MUCH WEAKER THAN HIS CONNECTIONS WITH THE COUNTRY
WHILE THEY OVERRATED THOSE SERVICES AND SUFFERINGS WHICH THEY NOW SAW MUST FOREVER GO UNREWARDED THE AFFECTIONATE DUTY ON THE OTHER HAND OF HIS MORE GENEROUS FRIENDS WHO RESPECTED HIS MISFORTUNES AND HIS VIRTUES AS MUCH AS HIS DIGNITY WRUNG HIS HEART WITH A NEW SORROW WHEN HE REFLECTED THAT SUCH DISINTERESTED ATTACHMENT WOULD SO SOON BE EXPOSED TO THE RIGOR OF HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMIES
THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS
SEDITIOUS ASSEMBLIES ENCOURAGED
AS IF THE HALF OF EUROPE NOW HIS ENEMY WERE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE EXERCISE OF MILITARY PROWESS
POMFRET CASTLE IN YORKSHIRE WAS SURPRISED BY MORRICE
BUT WHAT A DIFFERENCE WHEN THE DISCOURSE CONDUCT CONVERSATION AND PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC BEHAVIOR OF BOTH ARE INSPECTED
THEY WERE OFTEN WAITING ON THE KING AND DEBATING SOME POINTS OF THE TREATY WITH HIM UNTIL MIDNIGHT BEFORE THEY COULD COME TO A CONCLUSION
HE FIRST ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS FRIEND ST JOHN AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD COME WITH A PURPOSE OF DOING WHAT GRIEVED HIM TO THE VERY SOUL AND WHAT HE HAD EARNESTLY WITH TEARS BESOUGHT THE LORD NOT TO IMPOSE UPON HIM
IN PROPORTION TO THE INCREASE OF HIS AUTHORITY HIS TALENTS ALWAYS SEEMED TO EXPAND THEMSELVES
HIS CHILDREN WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO VISIT HIM AND THEY PASSED A FEW DAYS AT CAVERSHAM WHERE HE THEN RESIDED HE HAD NOT SEEN THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER HIS YOUNGEST SON AND THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH SINCE HE LEFT LONDON AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CIVIL DISORDERS NOR THE DUKE OF YORK SINCE HE WENT TO THE SCOTTISH ARMY BEFORE NEWARK
AND THE COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED FOR MAKING THE ASSESSMENTS HAD CONNIVED AT ALL FRAUDS WHICH MIGHT DIMINISH THE SUPPLY AND REDUCE THE CROWN TO STILL GREATER NECESSITIES
AND IN HIS PRESENT DISTRESS THEY AVOWED HIM BY THEIR GENEROUS TEARS FOR THEIR MONARCH WHOM IN THEIR MISGUIDED FURY THEY HAD BEFORE SO VIOLENTLY REJECTED
THE REMEDY WAS THOUGHT STILL MORE INTOLERABLE.[V THOUGH THE EXPEDIENCY IF WE ARE NOT RATHER TO SAY THE NECESSITY OF MARTIAL LAW HAD FORMERLY BEEN DEEMED OF ITSELF A SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR ESTABLISHING IT MEN NOW BECOME MORE JEALOUS OF LIBERTY AND MORE REFINED REASONERS IN QUESTIONS OF GOVERNMENT REGARDED AS ILLEGAL AND ARBITRARY EVERY EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY WHICH WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY EXPRESS STATUTE OR UNINTERRUPTED PRECEDENT
BY THE MOST MODERATE AND PROBABLY THE MOST REASONABLE ACCOUNT THEY ARE MADE TO AMOUNT TO FORTY THOUSAND
A COUNCIL OF STATE WAS ESTABLISHED CONSISTING OF MEN OF CHARACTER AND MODERATION
THE GARRISON TO THE NUMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MEN WERE MADE PRISONERS OF WAR
AND EXCEPTING THAT SUCH OF THE ROYALISTS AS HAD BORNE ARMS AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT AND ALL THEIR SONS WERE EXCLUDED A MORE FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BE DESIRED OR EXPECTED
HE OVERTOOK HIM AT DAVENTRY WHILE HE HAD YET ASSEMBLED BUT FOUR TROOPS OF HORSE

ENTANGLED IN A CHAIN OF CONSEQUENCES WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY BREAK HE WAS INCLINED TO GO HIGHER AND RATHER DENY THE FIRST PRINCIPLE THAN ADMIT OF CONCLUSIONS WHICH TO HIM APPEARED SO ABSURD AND UNREASONABLE
1_706_CHARLES1.JPG CHARLES I THREE TIMES WAS CHARLES PRODUCED BEFORE THE COURT AND AS OFTEN DECLINED THEIR JURISDICTION
SO THAT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT FROM THE UNITED EFFORTS OF CHRISTENDOM HAD BEEN DERIVED THIS REVOLUTION WHICH DIFFUSED EVERY WHERE SUCH UNIVERSAL SATISFACTION

THE RELIGION OF THE QUAKERS LIKE MOST OTHERS BEGAN WITH THE LOWEST VULGAR AND IN ITS PROGRESS CAME AT LAST TO COMPREHEND PEOPLE OF BETTER QUALITY AND FASHION
AND HE LEFT THE COMMAND OF IRELAND TO IRETON WHO GOVERNED THAT KINGDOM IN THE CHARACTER OF DEPUTY AND WITH VIGILANCE AND INDUSTRY PERSEVERED IN THE WORK OF SUBDUING AND EXPELLING THE NATIVES
THE KING'S FEET WERE SO HURT BY WALKING ABOUT IN HEAVY BOOTS OR COUNTRYMEN'S SHOES WHICH DID NOT FIT HIM THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO MOUNT ON HORSEBACK
AND NOTHING IN HIS JUDGMENT COULD EXCEED THE HUMILIATION ATTENDING SUCH A STATE BUT THE MEANNESS OF TAMELY SUBMITTING TO IT WITHOUT MAKING SOME EFFORTS TO PRESERVE THE AUTHORITY TRANSMITTED TO HIM BY HIS PREDECESSORS
AND THAT AT WORST TIME MIGHT BE GAINED BY THIS EXPEDIENT AND A DELAY OF THE IMMINENT DANGER WITH WHICH THE KING WAS AT PRESENT THREATENED CHARLES ON ASSEMBLING THE COUNCIL HAD DECLARED AGAINST ALL ADVANCES TOWARDS AN ACCOMMODATION

THERE IS INDEED NO OTHER PRINCIPLE BY WHICH THOSE LANDMARKS OR BOUNDARIES CAN BE SETTLED
THAT HE HIMSELF HAD ALREADY EXHAUSTED AND ANTICIPATED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE HIS WHOLE REVENUE AND HAD SCARCELY LEFT SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAILY SUBSISTENCE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY THAT ON HIS ACCESSION TO THE CROWN HE FOUND A DEBT OF ABOVE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER IN SUPPORT OF THE PALATINE

NO EVENT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN AS NECESSARY AT LEAST AS VERY PROBABLE
HOW COULD HE BE SUCH A BLOCKHEAD AS TO REAP NO GREATER BENEFIT FROM ALL HIS FATHER'S CRIMES AND SUCCESSES RICHARD EXTENDED HIS PEACEFUL AND QUIET LIFE TO AN EXTREME OLD AGE AND DIED NOT TILL THE LATTER END OF QUEEN ANNE'S REIGN
ALL BUSINESS BEING ALREADY CONCERTED THE TIME WAS ENTIRELY SPENT IN MIRTH AND ENTERTAINMENTS

ALL HIS ARTS AND POLICY WERE EXHAUSTED
YET IT WAS MADE AN EXPRESS ARTICLE OF THE TREATY THAT THE FRENCH KING SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AS SUCH
THAT RACE OF MEN WHO ARE AT PRESENT BOTH CARELESS AND IGNORANT IN ALL MATTERS OF RELIGION WERE AT THAT TIME ONLY IGNORANT
AND THEY WERE THEREFORE CAREFUL IN DISMISSING THEIR TROOPS TO PRESERVE NOTHING BUT THE APPEARANCE OF A PACIFIC DISPOSITION
THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT SENT SIR HARRY VANE ST JOHN AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS TO SETTLE SCOTLAND
THERE WAS ONE FELTON OF A GOOD FAMILY BUT OF AN ARDENT MELANCHOLIC TEMPER WHO HAD SERVED UNDER THE DUKE IN THE STATION OF LIEUTENANT
HE WAS CONSUMED WITH A DROPSY AND SCURVY AND HASTENED HOME THAT HE MIGHT YIELD UP HIS BREATH IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY WHICH HE HAD SO MUCH ADORNED BY HIS VALOR
SOME INVASIONS THEY SAID AND THOSE TOO OF MOMENT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN MADE ON NATIONAL PRIVILEGES
BUT THE SEQUEL SPOILED ALL
AND THE PLANS OF IMAGINARY REPUBLICS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STATE WERE EVERY DAY THE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION AMONG THESE ARMED LEGISLATORS
THE SAME SEVERITY WAS EXERCISED AS AT TREDAH
TO SUBDUE THE TURBULENT SPIRITS OF THE GREAT TO REDUCE THE REBELLIOUS HUGONOTS AND TO CURB THE ENCROACHING POWER OF THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
AND TILL THIS IMPORTANT POINT WAS OBTAINED THE NATION PROPERLY SPEAKING COULD NOT BE SAID TO ENJOY ANY REGULAR FREEDOM IT IS REMARKABLE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS INSTITUTION TO WHICH THERE IS NO PARALLEL IN ENGLAND THE ROYAL AUTHORITY WAS ALWAYS DEEMED MUCH LOWER IN SCOTLAND THAN IN THE FORMER KINGDOM
AND HE CHOSE THE SECOND FRIDAY OF EVERY MONTH FOR THE DEVOTION OF THE ROYALISTS IT WAS NOW PROPOSED AND CARRIED IN PARLIAMENT BY THE INDEPENDENTS THAT A NEW AND MORE SOLEMN FAST SHOULD BE VOTED
AND WITH EXPRESSIONS OF GREAT DISPLEASURE HE DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT
HE WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE LIBERTIES OF HIS PEOPLE AND WOULD NOT NOW BETRAY THEM BY RECOGNIZING A POWER FOUNDED ON THE MOST ATROCIOUS VIOLENCE AND USURPATION
ALL OF THEM POPULAR MEN AND CONSEQUENTLY SUPPOSED NOWISE AVERSE TO THE SCOTTISH INVASION OR UNACCEPTABLE TO THAT NATION AN ADDRESS ARRIVED FROM THE CITY OF LONDON PETITIONING FOR A PARLIAMENT
HE BLAMED THE INFAMOUS LIBELS EVERY WHERE DISPERSED AGAINST HIS PERSON AND THE NATIONAL RELIGION
AND TO HAVE NO PROSPECT OF THAT BLESSING BUT FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PRESENT PARLIAMENT AND FROM THE SUMMONING OF A NEW ONE FREE AND FULL WHO MEETING WITHOUT OATHS OR ENGAGEMENTS MIGHT FINALLY GIVE CONTENTMENT TO THE NATION
THEY RESOLVED THEREFORE TO GRATIFY THE PRIDE OF THE PARLIAMENT AND TO MAKE SOME ADVANCES TOWARDS PEACE
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HIGH COMMISSION BY JAMES WITHOUT ANY AUTHORITY OF LAW SEEMED A CONSIDERABLE ENCROACHMENT OF THE CROWN AND ERECTED THE MOST DANGEROUS AND ARBITRARY OF ALL COURTS BY A METHOD EQUALLY DANGEROUS AND ARBITRARY
THE EXCLUSIVE COMPANIES WHICH FORMERLY CONFINED TRADE WERE NEVER EXPRESSLY ABOLISHED BY ANY ORDINANCE OF PARLIAMENT DURING THE COMMONWEALTH
WITH REGARD TO IRELAND THERE WERE NO GREATER HOPES OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES
AMIDST THE VIRULENCE OF FACTION THE DECREES OF THE JUDGES WERE UPRIGHT AND IMPARTIAL
HE CARRIED THE TOWN

BUT ESPECIALLY BY THE SEVERAL CONGREGATIONS OF SAINTS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM SEE MILTON'S STATE PAPERS
THOUGH PERHAPS HE NEVER REACHED THE FAME OF A CONSUMMATE COMMANDER
265
AND THE ATTACHMENT OF THE GENTRY TO THE HEADS OF FAMILIES ESTABLISHED A KIND OF VOLUNTARY SERVITUDE UNDER THE CHIEFTAINS
HIS DESIGN WAS DISCOVERED
AND IN THEIR DEFAULT THAT THE VOTERS THEMSELVES SHOULD MEET AND PROCEED TO THE ELECTION OF MEMBERS IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF WRITS HAD BEEN REGULARLY ISSUED FROM THE CROWN
TWO SHIPS WERE BURNED AND ONE SUNK
SUCH IS THE INFLUENCE OF ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT THAT THE COMMONWEALTH THOUGH FOUNDED IN USURPATION THE MOST UNJUST AND UNPOPULAR HAD AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO RAISE EVERY WHERE THE MILITIA OF THE COUNTIES
AFTER THE UNION WITH SCOTLAND THE BIGOTED PREJUDICES OF THAT NATION REVIVED THE LIKE SPIRIT IN ENGLAND
TIMIDITY IS THE PRINCIPAL FAULT WITH WHICH HE IS REPROACHED
THE INSTANT THE KING HEARD OF THE REBELLION WHICH WAS A VERY FEW DAYS AFTER ITS COMMENCEMENT HE WROTE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND GAVE OVER TO THEM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WAR
BUT FOR THIS REPROACH THE MOST MALIGNANT SCRUTINY OF HIS CONDUCT WHICH IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOW THOROUGHLY KNOWN AFFORDS NOT ANY REASONABLE FOUNDATION
427
64 HERE THE HUSBAND BIDDING A FINAL ADIEU TO HIS EXPIRING FAMILY ENVIED THEM THAT FATE WHICH HE HIMSELF EXPECTED SO SOON TO SHARE
EVEN AMONGST THEMSELVES THEY DROPPED THAT PRETEXT
AFTER ENGLAND HAD CONCLUDED PEACE WITH ALL HER NEIGHBORS HE SOUGHT MILITARY EXPERIENCE IN THE LOW COUNTRIES THE GREAT SCHOOL OF WAR TO ALL THE EUROPEAN NATIONS
BUT THE JUDGES DECLARED THAT THOUGH THAT PRACTICE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY USUAL IT WAS ALTOGETHER ILLEGAL
THEY ASKED JOYCE WHETHER HE HAD ANY ORDERS FROM THE PARLIAMENT
WITH PLEASURE THEY BEHELD THE KING INVOLVED IN A FOREIGN WAR WHICH RENDERED HIM EVERY DAY MORE DEPENDENT ON THE PARLIAMENT
HIS OPINION THEREFORE WAS THAT THE KING SHOULD PUSH FORWARD AND ATTACK THE SCOTS AND BRING THE AFFAIR TO A QUICK DECISION
AND THOUGH THE DISTRESS OF THE IRISH WAS NOT MUCH INFERIOR BESIDES THAT THEY WERE MORE HARDENED AGAINST SUCH EXTREMITIES IT WAS BUT A MELANCHOLY REFLECTION THAT THE TWO NATIONS WHILE THEY CONTINUED THEIR FURIOUS ANIMOSITIES SHOULD MAKE DESOLATE THAT FERTILE ISLAND WHICH MIGHT SERVE TO THE SUBSISTENCE AND HAPPINESS OF BOTH
A COMMITTEE OF LORDS AND COMMONS WAS DESPATCHED TO INVITE HIS MAJESTY TO RETURN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT

NO SOONER HAD THE PRINCE ARRIVED THAN HE SAW SOME CAVALRY OF THE ENEMY APPROACHING THE GATES
TWO SUBSIDIES A VERY SMALL SUM WERE AT FIRST VOTED
AND THEY REFUSED TO ENTER INTO CONFERENCES WITH REGARD TO A PROPOSAL WHICH COULD SERVE ONLY TO DELAY ANY PRACTICABLE SCHEME OF ACCOMMODATION
BUT HIS VICTORY WAS NOT DECISIVE
THOUGH AT THAT TIME AND EVER AFTERWARDS HE POSITIVELY ASSERTED THE CONTRARY
DOES NOT CANDOR REQUIRE US RATHER TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HOPED HIS AUTHORITY WOULD SO FAR RECOVER AS TO ENABLE HIM TO OBTAIN THE NATIONAL CONSENT TO REESTABLISH EPISCOPACY WHICH HE BELIEVED SO MATERIAL A PART OF RELIGION AS WELL AS OF GOVERNMENT
ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRIAL WERE NOW ADJUSTED AND THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FULLY CONSTITUTED
TO EXPECT THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE CONVINCED BY SUCH REASONING MUST AGGRAVATE THE GENERAL INDIGNATION BY ADDING TO VIOLENCE AGAINST MEN'S PERSONS AND THEIR PROPERTY SO CRUEL A MOCKERY OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING
THE FANATICISM OF THE INDEPENDENTS EXALTED TO A HIGHER PITCH ABOLISHED ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT DISDAINED CREEDS AND SYSTEMS NEGLECTED EVERY CEREMONY AND CONFOUNDED ALL RANKS AND ORDERS
DURING THE COURSE OF SIX MONTHS NO SUPPLIES HAD COME FROM ENGLAND EXCEPT THE FOURTH PART OF ONE SMALL VESSEL'S LADING
WITH A PIERCING AND ANXIOUS EYE HE SURVEYED EVERY FACE TO WHICH HE WAS NOT DAILY ACCUSTOMED
AS PERHAPS IT HAD BEEN THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON THESE ZEALOTS
326
326
326

AND THEIR PLACE WAS SUPPLIED BY OTHERS MORE AGREEABLE TO THE RULING PARTY
THE SITUATION ALONE OF SCOTLAND AND IRELAND GAVE ANY IMMEDIATE INQUIETUDE TO THE NEW REPUBLIC
THE CLERK OF THE UPPER HOUSE IN READING BILLS TURNED HIS BACK ON THE BENCH OF BISHOPS
HE FREQUENTLY GAVE FEASTS TO HIS INFERIOR OFFICERS
NO DANGER REMAINS BUT WHAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM ALL FREE CONSTITUTIONS AND WHAT FORMS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THEIR FREEDOM
OF SPAIN KING WILLIAM'S AMBASSADORS GAVE THE DUKE OF ANJOU THE TITLE OF KING OF SPAIN
THE IMPERIOUS PARLIAMENT WOULD HEARKEN TO NONE OF THESE REASONS OR REMONSTRANCES
AND THAT THEY ALSO SHALL CHARGE EVERY SUCH PERSON IN HIS MAJESTY'S NAME UPON HIS ALLEGIANCE NOT TO DISCLOSE TO ANY ONE WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS SO VIOLENT AN INQUISITORIAL POWER SO IMPRACTICABLE AN ATTEMPT AT SECRECY WERE THE OBJECTS OF INDIGNATION AND EVEN IN SOME DEGREE OF RIDICULE
YET WAS IT MUCH INFERIOR TO THE VAST PROJECTS WHICH HE HAD FORMED
224 1ST EDIT
AND THEY THOUGHT IT BETTER POLICY BY AN UNLIMITED COMPLIANCE TO WARD OFF THAT RUIN WHICH THEY SAW APPROACHING THE ORDINANCE THEREFORE HAVING PASSED BOTH HOUSES ESSEX WARWICK MANCHESTER DENBIGH WALLER BRERETON AND MANY OTHERS RESIGNED THEIR COMMANDS AND RECEIVED THE THANKS OF PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR GOOD SERVICES
HIS EMINENT MORAL VIRTUES HAD PROCURED HIM ZEALOUS PARTISANS
V HERBERT'S MEMOIRS P
THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST STRAFFORD ARE TWENTY-EIGHT IN NUMBER
HAVING LOST ALL HOPE OF PREVAILING OVER THE RIGOR OF THE PARLIAMENT EITHER BY ARMS OR BY TREATY THE ONLY RESOURCE WHICH REMAINED TO THE KING WAS DERIVED FROM THE INTESTINE DISSENSIONS WHICH RAN VERY HIGH AMONG HIS ENEMIES
SIR EDMUND VERNEY WHO CARRIED THE KING'S STANDARD WAS KILLED AND THE STANDARD TAKEN
AND ORMOND WAS SECRETLY COME OVER WITH A VIEW OF CONCERTING MEASURES FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS PROJECT
FEW OR NO INSTANCES OF THEIR ENCROACHING AMBITION OR SELFISH CLAIMS HAD HITHERTO BEEN OBSERVED

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIR THEOPHILUS JONES AND OTHER OFFICERS THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND EXCLUDED LUDLOW WHO WAS ZEALOUS FOR THE RUMP PARLIAMENT BUT WHOM THEY PRETENDED TO BE IN A CONFEDERACY WITH THE COMMITTEE OF SAFETY
NO LESS THAN FORTY MEN AND WOMEN HAD AT DIFFERENT TIMES BEEN PRIVY TO HIS CONCEALMENT AND ESCAPE THE BATTLE OF WORCESTER AFFORDED CROMWELL WHAT HE CALLED HIS CROWNING MERCY SO ELATED WAS HE THAT HE INTENDED TO HAVE KNIGHTED IN THE FIELD TWO OF HIS GENERALS LAMBERT AND FLEETWOOD
HE DESIRED HOWEVER TO ENTER INTO A NEW NEGOTIATION AT NEWCASTLE
989
AND WHILE THE NATION IS FALLING EVERY DAY INTO POVERTY AND GROANS UNDER AN INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF TAXES THESE MEN MULTIPLY POSSESSION ON POSSESSION AND WILL IN A LITTLE TIME BE MASTERS OF ALL THE WEALTH OF THE KINGDOM
BUT WHEN THIS BILL WAS PRESENTED TO THE PEERS IT WAS REJECTED BY A GREAT MAJORITY THE FIRST CHECK WHICH THE COMMONS HAD RECEIVED IN THEIR POPULAR CAREER AND A PROGNOSTIC OF WHAT THEY MIGHT AFTERWARDS EXPECT FROM THE UPPER HOUSE WHOSE INCLINATIONS AND INTERESTS COULD NEVER BE TOTALLY SEPARATED FROM THE THRONE
SUCH IGNOMINIOUS TERMS WERE THERE INSISTED ON THAT WORSE COULD SCARCELY BE DEMANDED WERE CHARLES TOTALLY VANQUISHED A PRISONER AND IN CHAINS
HIS CHIEF AIM WAS TO GAIN TIME AND RELAX THE PREPARATIONS OF HIS ENEMIES
WORLD'S MISTAKE IN OLIVER CROMWELL
THEY ACCUSED HIM OF HAVING UNITED MANY OFFICES IN HIS PERSON
BY HIS EMINENT TALENTS AND ABILITIES STRAFFORD MERITED ALL THE CONFIDENCE WHICH HIS MASTER REPOSED IN HIM
THEY REMARKED THAT THE DELICATE BOUNDARIES WHICH SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE WERE ALREADY PASSED AND MANY CIVIL ORDINANCES ESTABLISHED BY THE CANONS UNDER COLOR OF ECCLESIASTICAL INSTITUTIONS
AND CONSEQUENTLY MIGHT BE WITHDRAWN AT THEIR PLEASURE
THE FEW SERVANTS WHO CONTINUED FAITHFUL TO HIM WERE SEIZED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE RAPID PROGRESS MADE BY THE COMMONS IN POWER AND POPULARITY AND WERE GLAD BY THEIR INACTIVE AND INOFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR TO COMPOUND FOR IMPUNITY
BUT RAPACITY AND AVARICE WERE VICES WITH WHICH HE WAS ENTIRELY UNACQUAINTED
LETTERS PAID ONLY ABOUT HALF THE PRESENT POSTAGE
FOR HE SAW HIM CONTRARY TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM RIDE OFF THE FIELD BEFORE THE ACTION WAS FINISHED
THEY ASPIRE NOT TO THE SUBLIME
ESSEX FIRST DREW OFF AND RETIRED TO WARWICK
THE KING'S FORCES PRESSING WITH VIGOR THOSE FOUR WAYS UP THE HILL AND THEIR ENEMIES OBSTINATELY DEFENDING THEMSELVES
AND THOU AND THEE WERE THE ONLY EXPRESSIONS WHICH ON ANY CONSIDERATION THEY COULD BE BROUGHT TO EMPLOY
FIVE SUBSIDIES WERE VOTED HIM
AND IT SEEMED NOWISE PROBABLE THAT HE INTENDED TO EMPLOY HIS INDUSTRY AND SPEND HIS BLOOD FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF ENE ENEMY ABOVE ANOTHER
THE DISCONTENTS OF THE NATION RAN HIGH ON ACCOUNT OF THIS VIOLENT RUPTURE BETWEEN THE KING AND PARLIAMENT
IRETON THE NEW DEPUTY OF IRELAND AT THE HEAD OF A NUMEROUS ARMY THIRTY THOUSAND STRONG PROSECUTED THE WORK OF SUBDUING THE REVOLTED IRISH
THEY REQUIRED HIM TO ISSUE ORDERS TO OXFORD AND TO ALL HIS OTHER GARRISONS COMMANDING THEIR SURRENDER TO THE PARLIAMENT
HE SUMMONED AN ASSEMBLY SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A CONVENTION OF STATES
BUT HERE IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION OR RATHER THE CONCURRENCE OF ACCIDENTS HAS PROVIDED IN DIFFERENT PERIODS CERTAIN IRREGULAR CHECKS TO THIS PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT AND THEREBY MAINTAINED IN SOME TOLERABLE MEASURE THE DIGNITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN
BUT IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER THE ROYALISTS WERE TOTALLY SUBDUED THAT HE RECOVERED HIS LIBERTY
AND WHICH THOUGH BORNE WITH CONSTANCY PREYED INWARDLY ON HIS SENSIBLE AND TENDER MIND
THE KING WAS FIRST IN MOTION
WHILE EMPLOYED FOR THAT PURPOSE IN THE LOW COUNTRIES HE HEARD OF THE TRAGICAL DEATH OF THE KING
OF FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS WHICH REPRESENTED ENGLAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY WERE CHOSEN BY THE COUNTIES
THIS LADY A DAUGHTER OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE OF TRIMOILLE IN FRANCE HAD DURING THE CIVIL WAR DISPLAYED A MANLY COURAGE BY HER OBSTINATE DEFENCE OF LATHAM HOUSE AGAINST THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES
THE LEADERS OF THE ARMY HAVING ESTABLISHED THEIR DOMINION OVER THE PARLIAMENT AND CITY VENTURED TO BRING THE KING TO HAMPTON COURT
27 20
LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON
IF UPON NECESSITY ANY ARTICLES BE CONDESCENDED UNTO WHEREIN THE KING'S LIEUTENANT CANNOT SO WELL BE SEEN IN AS NOT FIT FOR US AT PRESENT PUBLICLY TO OWN HERE NO ARTICLES ARE MENTIONED WHICH ARE NOT FIT TO BE COMMUNICATED TO ORMOND BUT ONLY NOT FIT FOR HIM AND THE KING PUBLICLY TO BE SEEN IN AND TO AVOW
AND THE COVENANT BY WHOSE MEANS ALONE THEY COULD EXPECT TO OBTAIN SO CONSIDERABLE A REENFORCEMENT AS THE ACCESSION OF THE SCOTTISH NATION WAS RECEIVED WITHOUT OPPOSITION
EVERY SUPERFLUITY AND ORNAMENT WAS CAREFULLY RETRENCHED
SEE JOURN

AND THIS WAS THE FIRST ACT DIGNIFIED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL CONSENT WHICH HAD EVER HAD THAT TENDENCY
IT THERE APPEARS THAT MARKHAM WAS FINED ONLY FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AND VERY DESERVEDLY
537
537
BOURDEAUX WAS SENT OVER TO ENGLAND AS MINISTER
AT NEWBURN UPON TYNE THEY WERE OPPOSED BY A DETACHMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEN UNDER CONWAY WHO SEEMED RESOLUTE TO DISPUTE WITH THEM THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER
THE SPOKESMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ONE DOUGLAS BEGAN WITH A SEVERE ASPECT INFORMED THE KING THAT GREAT SCANDAL HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THE GODLY ENLARGED ON THE HEINOUS NATURE OF SIN AND CONCLUDED WITH EXHORTING HIS MAJESTY WHENEVER HE WAS DISPOSED TO AMUSE HIMSELF TO BE MORE CAREFUL FOR THE FUTURE IN SHUTTING THE WINDOWS
P 108
HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT FOR HIS SERVICE
THAT THOUGH THE TESTIMONY AGAINST STRAFFORD WERE NOT CLEAR YET IN THIS WAY OF BILL PRIVATE SATISFACTION TO EACH MAN'S CONSCIENCE WAS SUFFICIENT EVEN SHOULD NO EVIDENCE AT ALL BE PRODUCED
AND HE MARCHED OUT HIS GARRISON WITH ALL THE HONORS OF WAR LORD FAIRFAX REMAINING IN THE CITY ESTABLISHED HIS GOVERNMENT IN THAT WHOLE COUNTY AND SENT A THOUSAND HORSE INTO LANCASHIRE TO JOIN WITH THE PARLIAMENTARY FORCES IN THAT QUARTER AND ATTEND THE MOTIONS OF THE SCOTTISH ARMY MARCHED NORTHWARDS IN ORDER TO JOIN THE EARL OF CALENDER WHO WAS ADVANCING WITH TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FORCES AND TO REDUCE THE TOWN OF NEWCASTLE WHICH THEY TOOK BY STORM
AND THOUGH THE KING APPROACHED WITH AN INTENTION OF OBLIGING ESSEX TO RAISE THE SIEGE THE DISPOSITION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS SO STRONG AS RENDERED THE DESIGN IMPRACTICABLE
AND EVERY THING TENDED TO ANARCHY AND CONFUSION
THE MINDS OF MEN IN BOTH STATES WERE EVERY DAY MORE IRRITATED AGAINST EACH OTHER
THE INDEPENDENT PARTY AMONG THE COMMONS EXULTED IN THEIR VICTORY
DUNDEE WAS A TOWN WELL FORTIFIED SUPPLIED WITH A GOOD GARRISON UNDER LUMISDEN AND FULL OF ALL THE RICH FURNITURE THE PLATE AND MONEY OF THE KINGDOM WHICH HAD BEEN SENT THITHER AS TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
SINCE IT HAD PERMITTED THEM TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ENEMIES AFTER THEY HAD ONCE RECOVERED THEIR LIBERTY
AND THE PATIENCE OR RATHER ALACRITY WITH WHICH THEY SUFFERED INCREASED STILL FURTHER THE INDIGNATION OF THE PUBLIC RUSH
AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONFIRM THE GENERAL IN HIS INCLINATION TO A FREE PARLIAMENT THE OBJECT OF ALL MEN'S PRAYERS AND ENDEAVORS
FOR IN PEACEABLE AND PROSPEROUS TIMES WHERE A NEUTRALITY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS OBSERVED SCARCELY ANY THING IS REMARKABLE BUT WHAT IS IN SOME DEGREE BLAMED OR BLAMABLE
NOR WAS THERE IN ALL THE DEBATE ONE PERSON WHO OFFERED TO STOP THE TORRENT BY ANY TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THE EARLS CONDUCT
THAT HIS FOLLOWING SERVICES HE HOPED HAD SUFFICIENTLY TESTIFIED HIS REPENTANCE
NOTE P P
THEY MURMURED EXTREMELY NOT ONLY AGAINST THEIR PRUDENT GENERAL BUT ALSO AGAINST THE LORD ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DELAYS IN GIVING THEM DELIVERANCE AND THEY PLAINLY TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WOULD NOT SAVE THEM FROM THE ENGLISH SECTARIES HE SHOULD NO LONGER BE THEIR GOD SIR EDW
BUT THAT HE MIGHT PRESERVE THE APPEARANCE OF NEUTRALITY HE MADE USE OF THE MARQUIS OF HAMILTON'S NAME RUSHWORTH VOL
SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY
BUT CHARLES HAD NEVER ATTAINED SUCH ENLARGED PRINCIPLES
AND DURING THE REST OF HIS REIGN HE SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE REGARDED FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXCEPT SO FAR AS HE WAS ENGAGED BY HONOR AND BY FRIENDSHIP FOR HIS SISTER AND THE PALATINE TO ENDEAVOR THE PROCURING OF SOME RELIEF FOR THAT UNHAPPY FAMILY
HE TOOK UNDERHAND HIS MEASURES WITH THE COURT AND DECLARED AGAINST THE PARLIAMENT
THE NEGOTIATION BEING BROUGHT TO AN ISSUE BY FREQUENT CONFERENCES BETWEEN THE MINISTERS THE MONARCHS THEMSELVES AGREED TO A CONGRESS
AND REMAINED SOME TIME IN WALES FROM THE VAIN HOPE OF RAISING A BODY OF INFANTRY IN THOSE HARASSED AND EXHAUSTED QUARTERS
1647 THE DOMINION OF THE PARLIAMENT WAS OF SHORT DURATION
TO ALL THESE CAUSES WE MUST YET ADD ANOTHER OF CONSIDERABLE MOMENT
THE SAME HORROR AGAINST POPERY WITH WHICH THE ENGLISH PURITANS WERE POSSESSED WAS OBSERVABLE AMONG THE POPULACE IN SCOTLAND
HE FRANKLY OFFERED THE FORMER CONCESSION BUT LONG SCRUPLED THE LATTER
AND EVEN IN OUR TIME IT IS JUSTLY ADMIRED AS A WORK OF GENIUS AND INVENTION
AND IT IS BUT JUSTICE IN THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT AT ANY HAZARD THOSE WHO HAVE SO GENEROUSLY EXPOSED THEMSELVES TO THE UTMOST HAZARD FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST
HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER MARRIED TO FLEETWOOD HAD ADOPTED REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES SO VEHEMENT THAT SHE COULD NOT WITH PATIENCE BEHOLD POWER LODGED IN A SINGLE PERSON EVEN IN HER INDULGENT FATHER
AND HAD EVEN EMPLOYED PERSUASION WITH HIS OWN REGIMENT THOUGH NONE ELSE SHOULD FOLLOW HIM TO RESCUE THE KING FROM HIS DISLOYAL MURDERERS
THAT THE LAWS SHOULD BE EXECUTED AGAINST CATHOLICS
A GREAT NUMBER OF THEIR SHIPS ABOVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
SUCH AS EVEN IN THEIR FAMOUS REMONSTRANCE THEY THOUGHT PROPER TO OMIT AS INCREDIBLE AND EXTRAVAGANT
AS THEY POSSESSED NO MEANS OF RESISTING THE FORCE UNDER HIS COMMAND THEY WERE GLAD TO TEMPORIZE WITH HIM AND BY SEEMING TO BE DECEIVED WAIT FOR OPPORTUNITIES OF FREEING THEMSELVES FROM HIS DOMINION
THEY SENT SKIPPON CROMWELL IRETON AND FLEETWOOD TO THE HEAD QUARTERS AT SAFFRON WELDON IN ESSEX AND EMPOWERED THEM TO MAKE OFFERS TO THE ARMY AND INQUIRE INTO THE CAUSE OF ITS DISTEMPERS
THE ICON PASSED THROUGH FIFTY EDITIONS IN A TWELVEMONTH
AND WITH ONE CONSENT THE ARMY TO THE NUMBER OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND MEN ROSE FROM THEIR CAMP AND ADVANCED BY GREAT JOURNEYS TOWARDS THE SOUTH
NOR OUGHT THE APPREHENSION OF SUCH AN EVENT TO BE REGARDED IN THEM AS A SELFISH CONSIDERATION
ON THE OTHER HAND THE MOTION WAS SUPPORTED BY EVERY ONE WHO WAS MORE PARTICULARLY DEVOTED TO THE PROTECTOR AND WHO HOPED BY SO ACCEPTABLE A MEASURE TO PAY COURT TO THE PREVAILING AUTHORITY
AND THEY APPOINTED COMMISSIONERS IN EVERY PROVINCE TO JUDGE OF SUCH CASES AS FELL NOT WITHIN THEIR GENERAL ORDINANCE SO MUCH CIVIL AUTHORITY INTERMIXED WITH THE ECCLESIASTICAL GAVE DISGUST TO ALL THE ZEALOTS
46 47
AND THAT IMPORTANT BRANCH OF PREROGATIVE THE STRONG SYMBOL OF ARBITRARY POWER AND UNINTELLIGIBLE IN A LIMITED CONSTITUTION BEING AT LAST REMOVED LEFT THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT MORE CONSISTENT AND UNIFORM
PYM CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE
BUT THOUGH HE WAS PLAINLY GUILTY HE WAS ACQUITTED TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE PEOPLE
UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE MAGAZINE OF HULL CONTAINED THE ARMS OF ALL THE FORCES LEVIED AGAINST THE SCOTS
THAT THE PARLIAMENT OF IRELAND HAD TWICE PUT SUCH TRUST IN HIS GOOD INTENTIONS AS TO GRANT HIM IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SESSION A LARGE SUPPLY AND HAD EVER EXPERIENCED GOOD EFFECTS FROM THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM

ONE DORCAS BARBERRY MADE OATH BEFORE A MAGISTRATE THAT SHE HAD BEEN DEAD TWO DAYS AND THAT NAYLOR HAD BROUGHT HER TO LIFE
WHEN PENDENNIS CASTLE WAS SURRENDERED TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ARMY HAMILTON WHO THEN OBTAINED HIS LIBERTY RETURNED INTO SCOTLAND
THEN IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THEIR ENEMIES BE PUNISHED AT LAST THEY CLAIMED A RIGHT OF MODELLING THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT AND SETTLING THE NATION THEY PRESERVED IN WORDS ALL DEFERENCE AND RESPECT TO THE PARLIAMENT
699 ETC
THE PARLIAMENT WAS NO LESS ALARMED AT THE MILITARY CABALS
BY A SPEECH OF SIR SIMON D'EWES IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE NATION NEVER HAD EVEN TO THAT TIME BEEN RIGHTLY INFORMED CONCERNING THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE SPANISH NEGOTIATION AND STILL BELIEVED THE COURT OF MADRID TO HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER INSINCERE IN THEIR PROFESSIONS
THEY REPRESENT THE SPANIARDS AS TOTALLY INSINCERE THAT THEY MAY REPROACH JAMES WITH CREDULITY IN BEING SO LONG DECEIVED BY THEM
BUT THEIR CONSPIRACY BEING DETECTED THEY WERE ARRESTED AND SENT PRISONERS TO LONDON
THAT THIS HATH BEEN DONE APPEARETH BY THE BILLETING OF SOLDIERS A THING NOWISE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE KING'S SERVICE AND A BURDEN TO THE COMMONWEALTH
HE NOW WENT SO FAR AS TO OFFER THEM A TOTAL ABOLITION OF THAT OBNOXIOUS CLAIM BY ANY LAW WHICH THE COMMONS SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PRESENT TO HIM
BUT BEING THREATENED BY SIR HARDRESS WALLER COLONEL JOHN JONES AND OTHER OFFICERS HE VERY QUIETLY RESIGNED HIS COMMAND AND RETIRED TO ENGLAND
AND THE PARLIAMENT THOUGHT THAT HIS FIDELITY TO THEM MIGHT ON THAT ACCOUNT BE ENTIRELY DEPENDED ON
THE SACRED CHARACTER WHICH GIVES THE PRIESTHOOD SUCH AUTHORITY OVER MANKIND BECOMING MORE VENERABLE FROM THE SUFFERINGS ENDURED FOR THE SAKE OF PRINCIPLE BY THESE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS AGGRAVATED THE GENERAL INDIGNATION AGAINST THEIR PERSECUTORS
THIS LAST ARTICLE WAS THOUGHT SO IGNOMINIOUS AND SO PREJUDICIAL TO THE KING'S INTERESTS THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS TRIED BY A COUNCIL OF WAR AND CONDEMNED TO LOSE HIS LIFE FOR CONSENTING TO IT
329
WHOSE NAME HITHERTO HAD COMMONLY IN ALL DEBATES BEEN MENTIONED WITH SOME DEGREE OF REVERENCE
HIS VIGOR OF MIND WHICH THOUGH IT SOMETIMES FAILED HIM IN ACTING NEVER DESERTED HIM IN HIS SUFFERINGS WAS WHAT ALONE SUPPORTED HIM
THE ENGLISH COMMONS LIKEWISE IN THEIR FURIOUS PERSECUTION OF STRAFFORD HAD OVERLOOKED THE MOST OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCES
THE LONG PRAYERS WHICH HE SAID TO HIS FAMILY IN THE MORNING AND AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON CONSUMED HIS OWN TIME AND THAT OF HIS PLOUGHMEN
AND HE HIMSELF LEAVING MONK WITH SEVEN THOUSAND MEN TO COMPLETE THE REDUCTION OF SCOTLAND FOLLOWED THE KING WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION POSSIBLE
THE FIGHT CONTINUED WITH DOUBTFUL SUCCESS TILL WORD WAS BROUGHT TO THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE CORNISH THAT THEIR AMMUNITION WAS SPENT TO LESS THAN FOUR BARRELS OF POWDER
A PETITION TO WHICH FIFTEEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE ANNEXED AND WHICH WAS PRESENTED BY ALDERMAN PENNINGTON THE CITY MEMBER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT AMONG THE MANY ECCLESIASTICAL ABUSES THERE COMPLAINED OF AN ALLOWANCE GIVEN BY THE LICENSERS OF BOOKS TO PUBLISH A TRANSLATION OF OVID'S ART OF LOVE IS NOT FORGOTTEN BY THESE RUSTIC CENSORS NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAVORABLE DISPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE THE LEADERS IN THE HOUSE RESOLVED TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION
THE ALARM WAS CONVEYED TO THE CITY AND ALL THE PROTESTANTS PREPARED FOR DEFENCE
MY INTENTION IS NOT TO DISFIGURE THIS PICTURE DRAWN BY SO MASTERLY A HAND
HE THANKED THEM HOWEVER FOR THEIR OFFICIOUS ZEAL
AND DISPLAYED THAT MASCULINE ELOQUENCE AND UNDAUNTED LOVE OF LIBERTY WHICH FROM HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBLIME SPIRITS OF ANTIQUITY HE HAD GREEDILY IMBIBED
NO HIGH COMMISSION."[V ALL THESE INSTANCES OF DISCONTENT WERE PRESAGES OF SOME GREAT REVOLUTION HAD THE COURT POSSESSED SUFFICIENT SKILL TO DISCERN THE DANGER OR SUFFICIENT POWER TO PROVIDE AGAINST IT
THE COMMONS VOTED FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS TO BUY A JEWEL FOR GRANVILLE WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM THE KING'S GRACIOUS MESSAGES
AND IF HIS POLITICAL PRUDENCE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO EXTRICATE HIM FROM SO PERILOUS A SITUATION HE MAY BE EXCUSED
AND HE LEFT THEM WITHOUT COMMUNICATING HIS INTENTIONS TO ANY OF THEM
THE PARLIAMENT HAD SENT ORDERS TO FORBEAR ALL HOSTILITIES AND HAD EXPECTED THE SAME FROM THE KING
BUT WAS ORDERED TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE TO THE USHER AND IMMEDIATELY TO DEPART THE CITY
AND IF HE BE AFTERWARDS PLEASED TO EMPLOY ARTIFICE OR POLICY IT MAY BE REGARDED ON MOST OCCASIONS AS GREAT CONDESCENSION IF NOT AS SUPERFLUOUS CAUTION
