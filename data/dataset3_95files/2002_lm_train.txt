NEVERMORE ALONE UPON THE THRESHOLD OF MY DOOR OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE I SHALL COMMAND THE USES OF MY SOUL NOR LIFT MY HAND SERENELY IN THE SUNSHINE AS BEFORE WITHOUT THE SENSE OF THAT WHICH I FORBORE THY TOUCH UPON THE PALM
THEN THOU DIDST COME--TO BE BELOVED WHAT THEY SEEMED
THEIR SHINING FRONTS THEIR SONGS THEIR SPLENDOURS BETTER YET THE SAME AS RIVER-WATER HALLOWED INTO FONTS MET IN THEE AND FROM OUT THEE OVERCAME MY SOUL WITH SATISFACTION OF ALL WANTS
IV THOU HAST THY CALLING TO SOME PALACE-FLOOR V I LIFT MY HEAVY HEART UP SOLEMNLY VI GO FROM ME
SO IN THE LIKE NAME OF THAT LOVE OF OURS TAKE BACK THESE THOUGHTS WHICH HERE UNFOLDED TOO AND WHICH ON WARM AND COLD DAYS I WITHDREW FROM MY HEART'S GROUND
I LOVE THEE WITH A LOVE I SEEMED TO LOSE WITH MY LOST SAINTS,--I LOVE THEE WITH THE BREATH SMILES TEARS OF ALL MY LIFE!--AND IF GOD CHOOSE I SHALL BUT LOVE THEE BETTER AFTER DEATH
YET HERE'S EGLANTINE HERE'S IVY!--TAKE THEM AS I USED TO DO THY FLOWERS AND KEEP THEM WHERE THEY SHALL NOT PINE
AND I SANK AND QUAILED AS IF GOD'S FUTURE THUNDERED ON MY PAST
AND YET I CANNOT RUE THE SIN MOST BUT THE OCCASION--THAT WE TWO SHOULD FOR A MOMENT STAND UNMINISTERED BY A MUTUAL PRESENCE
A SHADE IN WHICH TO SING--OF PALM OR PINE
GROWING STRAIGHT OUT OF MAN'S REACH ON THE HILL
THOU CANST WAIT THROUGH SORROW AND SICKNESS TO BRING SOULS TO TOUCH AND THINK IT SOON WHEN OTHERS CRY TOO LATE XLI I THANK ALL WHO HAVE LOVED ME IN THEIR HEARTS WITH THANKS AND LOVE FROM MINE
RATHER INSTANTLY RENEW THY PRESENCE
WONDERFUL NEVER TO FEEL THEE THRILL THE DAY OR NIGHT WITH PERSONAL ACT OR SPEECH,--NOR EVER CULL SOME PRESCIENCE OF THEE WITH THE BLOSSOMS WHITE THOU SAWEST GROWING
XXXVI WHEN WE MET FIRST AND LOVED I DID NOT BUILD UPON THE EVENT WITH MARBLE
TRANSCRIBED FROM THE 1906 CARADOC PRESS EDITION BY DAVID PRICE EMAIL CCX074@COVENTRY.AC.UK
FOR FREQUENT TEARS HAVE RUN THE COLOURS FROM MY LIFE AND LEFT SO DEAD AND PALE A STUFF IT WERE NOT FITLY DONE TO GIVE THE SAME AS PILLOW TO THY HEAD
XXXVII PARDON OH PARDON THAT MY SOUL SHOULD MAKE OF ALL THAT STRONG DIVINENESS WHICH I KNOW FOR THINE AND THEE AN IMAGE ONLY SO FORMED OF THE SAND AND FIT TO SHIFT AND BREAK
BUT THOU WHO IN MY VOICE'S SINK AND FALL WHEN THE SOB TOOK IT THY DIVINEST ART'S OWN INSTRUMENT DIDST DROP DOWN AT THY FOOT TO HARKEN WHAT I SAID BETWEEN MY TEARS INSTRUCT ME HOW TO THANK THEE
BELOVED I AMID THE DARKNESS GREETED BY A DOUBTFUL SPIRIT-VOICE IN THAT DOUBT'S PAIN CRY SPEAK ONCE MORE--THOU LOVEST WHO CAN FEAR TOO MANY STARS THOUGH EACH IN HEAVEN SHALL ROLL TOO MANY FLOWERS THOUGH EACH SHALL CROWN THE YEAR
HERE ON MY HEART AS ON THY BROW TO LACK NO NATURAL HEAT TILL MINE GROWS COLD IN DEATH
BEHOLD I ERRED IN THAT LAST DOUBT
AND YET BECAUSE I LOVE THEE I OBTAIN FROM THAT SAME LOVE THIS VINDICATING GRACE TO LIVE ON STILL IN LOVE AND YET IN VAIN TO BLESS THEE YET RENOUNCE THEE TO THY FACE
XXI SAY OVER AGAIN AND YET ONCE OVER AGAIN THAT THOU DOST LOVE ME
GATHER THE NORTH FLOWERS TO COMPLETE THE SOUTH AND CATCH THE EARLY LOVE UP IN THE LATE
IV THOU HAST THY CALLING TO SOME PALACE-FLOOR MOST GRACIOUS SINGER OF HIGH POEMS
THE ACOLYTE AMID THE CHANTED JOY AND THANKFUL RITE MAY SO FALL FLAT WITH PALE INSENSATE BROW ON THE ALTAR-STAIR
XLII MY FUTURE WILL NOT COPY FAIR MY PAST I WROTE THAT ONCE
X YET LOVE MERE LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL INDEED XI AND THEREFORE IF TO LOVE CAN BE DESERT XII INDEED THIS VERY LOVE WHICH IS MY BOAST XIII AND WILT THOU HAVE ME FASHION INTO SPEECH XIV IF THOU MUST LOVE ME LET IT BE FOR NOUGHT XV ACCUSE ME NOT BESEECH THEE THAT I WEAR XVI AND YET BECAUSE THOU OVERCOMEST SO XVII MY POET THOU CANST TOUCH ON ALL THE NOTES XVIII I NEVER GAVE A LOCK OF HAIR AWAY XIX THE SOUL'S RIALTO HATH ITS MERCHANDIZE XX BELOVED MY BELOVED WHEN I THINK XXI SAY OVER AGAIN AND YET ONCE OVER AGAIN XXII WHEN OUR TWO SOULS STAND UP ERECT AND STRONG XXIII IS IT INDEED SO
ALL IS SAID WITHOUT A WORD XXXII THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SUN ROSE ON THINE OATH XXXIII YES CALL ME BY MY PET-NAME
YET O MY PALM-TREE BE IT UNDERSTOOD I WILL NOT HAVE MY THOUGHTS INSTEAD OF THEE WHO ART DEARER BETTER
FIRE IS BRIGHT LET TEMPLE BURN OR FLAX
AND I OWN AND GRIEVE THAT GIVERS OF SUCH GIFTS AS MINE ARE MUST BE COUNTED WITH THE UNGENEROUS
I MARVELLED MY BELOVED WHEN I READ THY THOUGHT SO IN THE LETTER
I LOVE THEE PURELY AS THEY TURN FROM PRAISE
WHEN I ANSWER NOW I DROP A GRAVE THOUGHT BREAK FROM SOLITUDE
THIS SAID,--HE WISHED TO HAVE ME IN HIS SIGHT ONCE AS A FRIEND
HOPES APACE WERE CHANGED TO LONG DESPAIRS TILL GOD'S OWN GRACE COULD SCARCELY LIFT ABOVE THE WORLD FORLORN MY HEAVY HEART
THE NAMES OF COUNTRY HEAVEN ARE CHANGED AWAY FOR WHERE THOU ART OR SHALT BE THERE OR HERE
XVII MY POET THOU CANST TOUCH ON ALL THE NOTES GOD SET BETWEEN HIS AFTER AND BEFORE AND STRIKE UP AND STRIKE OFF THE GENERAL ROAR OF THE RUSHING WORLDS A MELODY THAT FLOATS IN A SERENE AIR PURELY
FOR THIS COUNTERPART THE BAY CROWN'S SHADE BELOVED I SURMISE STILL LINGERS ON THY CURL IT IS SO BLACK
OUR HANDS WOULD TOUCH FOR ALL THE MOUNTAIN-BARS
XXXII THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SUN ROSE ON THINE OATH TO LOVE ME I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE MOON TO SLACKEN ALL THOSE BONDS WHICH SEEMED TOO SOON AND QUICKLY TIED TO MAKE A LASTING TROTH
WHAT HAST THOU TO DO WITH LOOKING FROM THE LATTICE-LIGHTS AT ME A POOR TIRED WANDERING SINGER SINGING THROUGH THE DARK AND LEANING UP A CYPRESS TREE
ASK GOD WHO KNOWS
FOR PERFECT STRAINS MAY FLOAT NEATH MASTER-HANDS FROM INSTRUMENTS DEFACED AND GREAT SOULS AT ONE STROKE MAY DO AND DOAT
STRAIGHTWAY I WAS WARE SO WEEPING HOW A MYSTIC SHAPE DID MOVE BEHIND ME AND DREW ME BACKWARD BY THE HAIR
I HAVE HEARD LOVE TALKED IN MY EARLY YOUTH AND SINCE NOT SO LONG BACK BUT THAT THE FLOWERS THEN GATHERED SMELL STILL
LOOK ON ME--BREATHE ON ME
LIFE TO LIFE I LEAN UPON THEE DEAR WITHOUT ALARM AND FEEL AS SAFE AS GUARDED BY A CHARM AGAINST THE STAB OF WORLDLINGS WHO IF RIFE ARE WEAK TO INJURE
XL OH YES
X YET LOVE MERE LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL INDEED AND WORTHY OF ACCEPTATION
AND LOVE IS FIRE
HOW REFER THE CAUSE?--BELOVED IS IT THOU OR I WHO MAKES ME SAD
MEN COULD NOT PART US WITH THEIR WORLDLY JARS NOR THE SEAS CHANGE US NOR THE TEMPESTS BEND
XI AND THEREFORE IF TO LOVE CAN BE DESERT I AM NOT ALL UNWORTHY
IX CAN IT BE RIGHT TO GIVE WHAT I CAN GIVE
SILENCE ON THE BIER WHILE I CALL GOD--CALL GOD!--SO LET THY MOUTH BE HEIR TO THOSE WHO ARE NOW EXANIMATE
AH KEEP NEAR AND CLOSE THOU DOVE-LIKE HELP
VIII WHAT CAN I GIVE THEE BACK O LIBERAL AND PRINCELY GIVER WHO HAST BROUGHT THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF THINE HEART UNSTAINED UNTOLD AND LAID THEM ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE WALL FOR SUCH AS I TO TAKE OR LEAVE WITHAL IN UNEXPECTED LARGESSE
I LOVE THEE TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH AND HEIGHT MY SOUL CAN REACH WHEN FEELING OUT OF SIGHT FOR THE ENDS OF BEING AND IDEAL GRACE
AS ONE WHO SITS AND GAZES FROM ABOVE OVER THE RIVERS TO THE BITTER SEA
ANTIDOTES OF MEDICATED MUSIC ANSWERING FOR MANKIND'S FORLORNEST USES THOU CANST POUR FROM THENCE INTO THEIR EARS
AND REPLIED ONE OF US THAT WAS GOD AND LAID THE CURSE SO DARKLY ON MY EYELIDS AS TO AMERCE MY SIGHT FROM SEEING THEE,--THAT IF I HAD DIED THE DEATH-WEIGHTS PLACED THERE WOULD HAVE SIGNIFIED LESS ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION
BUT IF INSTEAD THOU WAIT BESIDE ME FOR THE WIND TO BLOW THE GREY DUST UP THOSE LAURELS ON THINE HEAD O MY BELOVED WILL NOT SHIELD THEE SO THAT NONE OF ALL THE FIRES SHALL SCORCH AND SHRED THE HAIR BENEATH
I FIND THEE
HOW DEAREST WILT THOU HAVE ME FOR MOST USE
YET I FEEL THAT I SHALL STAND HENCEFORWARD IN THY SHADOW
THUS WITH A FILLET OF SMOOTH-KISSING BREATH I TIE THE SHADOWS SAFE FROM GLIDING BACK AND LAY THE GIFT WHERE NOTHING HINDERETH
AND THINKING AT MY SIDE MY MINISTERING LIFE-ANGEL JUSTIFIED THE WORD BY HIS APPEALING LOOK UPCAST TO THE WHITE THRONE OF GOD I TURNED AT LAST AND THERE INSTEAD SAW THEE NOT UNALLIED TO ANGELS IN THY SOUL
XLIII HOW DO I LOVE THEE
OUT ALAS
AS A STRONG TREE SHOULD RUSTLE THY BOUGHS AND SET THY TRUNK ALL BARE AND LET THESE BANDS OF GREENERY WHICH INSPHERE THEE DROP HEAVILY DOWN,--BURST SHATTERED EVERYWHERE
XXXIV WITH THE SAME HEART I SAID I'LL ANSWER THEE AS THOSE WHEN THOU SHALT CALL ME BY MY NAME LO THE VAIN PROMISE
MY HAIR NO LONGER BOUNDS TO MY FOOT'S GLEE NOR PLANT I IT FROM ROSE OR MYRTLE-TREE AS GIRLS DO ANY MORE
XXV A HEAVY HEART BELOVED HAVE I BORNE FROM YEAR TO YEAR UNTIL I SAW THY FACE AND SORROW AFTER SORROW TOOK THE PLACE OF ALL THOSE NATURAL JOYS AS LIGHTLY WORN AS THE STRINGED PEARLS EACH LIFTED IN ITS TURN BY A BEATING HEART AT DANCE-TIME
IF I LAY HERE DEAD WOULDST THOU MISS ANY LIFE IN LOSING MINE
FOR WE TWO LOOK TWO WAYS AND CANNOT SHINE WITH THE SAME SUNLIGHT ON OUR BROW AND HAIR
MAKE THY LOVE LARGER TO ENLARGE MY WORTH
BUT LOVE ME FOR LOVE'S SAKE THAT EVERMORE THOU MAY'ST LOVE ON THROUGH LOVE'S ETERNITY
AND EVER SINCE IT GREW MORE CLEAN AND WHITE
I HEAR THY VOICE AND VOW PERPLEXED UNCERTAIN SINCE THOU ART OUT OF SIGHT AS HE IN HIS SWOONING EARS THE CHOIR'S AMEN
LAY THY HAND ON IT BEST ONE AND ALLOW THAT NO CHILD'S FOOT COULD RUN FAST AS THIS BLOOD
ATHEISTS ARE AS DULL WHO CANNOT GUESS GOD'S PRESENCE OUT OF SIGHT
I LOVE THEE TO THE LEVEL OF EVERYDAY'S MOST QUIET NEED BY SUN AND CANDLELIGHT
LET ME COUNT THE WAYS XLIV BELOVED THOU HAST BROUGHT ME MANY FLOWERS I I THOUGHT ONCE HOW THEOCRITUS HAD SUNG OF THE SWEET YEARS THE DEAR AND WISHED-FOR YEARS WHO EACH ONE IN A GRACIOUS HAND APPEARS TO BEAR A GIFT FOR MORTALS OLD OR YOUNG
BELOVED I ONLY LOVE THEE
I SIT BENEATH THY LOOKS AS CHILDREN DO IN THE NOON-SUN WITH SOULS THAT TREMBLE THROUGH THEIR HAPPY EYELIDS FROM AN UNAVERRED YET PRODIGAL INWARD JOY
THE WIDEST LAND DOOM TAKES TO PART US LEAVES THY HEART IN MINE WITH PULSES THAT BEAT DOUBLE
XXVII MY OWN BELOVED WHO HAST LIFTED ME FROM THIS DREAR FLAT OF EARTH WHERE I WAS THROWN AND IN BETWIXT THE LANGUID RINGLETS BLOWN A LIFE-BREATH TILL THE FOREHEAD HOPEFULLY SHINES OUT AGAIN AS ALL THE ANGELS SEE BEFORE THY SAVING KISS
XXIV LET THE WORLD'S SHARPNESS LIKE A CLASPING KNIFE SHUT IN UPON ITSELF AND DO NO HARM IN THIS CLOSE HAND OF LOVE NOW SOFT AND WARM AND LET US HEAR NO SOUND OF HUMAN STRIFE AFTER THE CLICK OF THE SHUTTING
AS BRIGHTER LADIES DO NOT COUNT IT STRANGE FOR LOVE TO GIVE UP ACRES AND DEGREE I YIELD THE GRAVE FOR THY SAKE AND EXCHANGE MY NEAR SWEET VIEW OF HEAVEN FOR EARTH WITH THEE
A GRAVE ON WHICH TO REST FROM SINGING
XLI I THANK ALL WHO HAVE LOVED ME IN THEIR HEARTS XLII MY FUTURE WILL NOT COPY FAIR MY PAST XLIII HOW DO I LOVE THEE
THEY LOVE THROUGH ALL THIS WORLD OF OURS
THEY LOVE THROUGH ALL THIS WORLD OF OURS
SONNETS FROM THE PORTUGUESE INDEX OF FIRST LINES I I THOUGHT ONCE HOW THEOCRITUS HAD SUNG II BUT ONLY THREE IN ALL GOD'S UNIVERSE III UNLIKE ARE WE UNLIKE O PRINCELY HEART
XXII WHEN OUR TWO SOULS STAND UP ERECT AND STRONG FACE TO FACE SILENT DRAWING NIGH AND NIGHER UNTIL THE LENGTHENING WINGS BREAK INTO FIRE AT EITHER CURVED POINT,--WHAT BITTER WRONG CAN THE EARTH DO TO US THAT WE SHOULD NOT LONG BE HERE CONTENTED
BROOD DOWN WITH THY DIVINE SUFFICIENCIES THESE THOUGHTS WHICH TREMBLE WHEN BEREFT OF THOSE LIKE CALLOW BIRDS LEFT DESERT TO THE SKIES
AS IF A SHIPWRECKED PAGAN SAFE IN PORT HIS GUARDIAN SEA-GOD TO COMMEMORATE SHOULD SET A SCULPTURED PORPOISE GILLS A-SNORT AND VIBRANT TAIL WITHIN THE TEMPLE-GATE
III UNLIKE ARE WE UNLIKE O PRINCELY HEART
I WILL NOT GAINSAY LOVE CALLED LOVE FORSOOTH
POLYPHEME'S WHITE TOOTH SLIPS ON THE NUT IF AFTER FREQUENT SHOWERS THE SHELL IS OVER-SMOOTH,--AND NOT SO MUCH WILL TURN THE THING CALLED LOVE ASIDE TO HATE OR ELSE TO OBLIVION
GO
CHEEKS AS PALE AS THESE YOU SEE AND TREMBLING KNEES THAT FAIL TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF A HEAVY HEART THIS WEARY MINSTREL-LIFE THAT ONCE WAS GIRT TO CLIMB AORNUS AND CAN SCARCE AVAIL TO PIPE NOW GAINST THE VALLEY NIGHTINGALE A MELANCHOLY MUSIC,--WHY ADVERT TO THESE THINGS
NAY LET THE SILENCE OF MY WOMANHOOD COMMEND MY WOMAN-LOVE TO THY BELIEF SEEING THAT I STAND UNWON HOWEVER WOOED AND REND THE GARMENT OF MY LIFE IN BRIEF BY A MOST DAUNTLESS VOICELESS FORTITUDE LEST ONE TOUCH OF THIS HEART CONVEY ITS GRIEF
YET LOVE ME--WILT THOU
AND HEAVEN BEING ROLLED BETWEEN US AT THE END WE SHOULD BUT VOW THE FASTER FOR THE STARS
BEHOLD AND SEE WHAT A GREAT HEAP OF GRIEF LAY HID IN ME AND HOW THE RED WILD SPARKLES DIMLY BURN THROUGH THE ASHEN GREYNESS
TO RUN AND ANSWER WITH THE SMILE THAT CAME AT PLAY LAST MOMENT AND WENT ON WITH ME THROUGH MY OBEDIENCE
XXXV IF I LEAVE ALL FOR THEE WILT THOU EXCHANGE AND BE ALL TO ME
WILL THAT LIGHT COME AGAIN AS NOW THESE TEARS COME--FALLING HOT AND REAL
LEAVE HERE THE PAGES WITH LONG MUSING CURLED AND WRITE ME NEW MY FUTURE'S EPIGRAPH NEW ANGEL MINE UNHOPED FOR IN THE WORLD
XXXI THOU COMEST
FAST IT SINKETH AS A THING WHICH ITS OWN NATURE DOES PRECIPITATE WHILE THINE DOTH CLOSE ABOVE IT MEDIATING BETWIXT THE STARS AND THE UNACCOMPLISHED FATE
NAY WILT THOU FILL THAT PLACE BY ME WHICH IS FILLED BY DEAD EYES TOO TENDER TO KNOW CHANGE THAT'S HARDEST
XIV IF THOU MUST LOVE ME LET IT BE FOR NOUGHT EXCEPT FOR LOVE'S SAKE ONLY
IN MOUNTING HIGHER THE ANGELS WOULD PRESS ON US AND ASPIRE TO DROP SOME GOLDEN ORB OF PERFECT SONG INTO OUR DEEP DEAR SILENCE
THE SECOND PASSED IN HEIGHT THE FIRST AND SOUGHT THE FOREHEAD AND HALF MISSED HALF FALLING ON THE HAIR
ALL DEAD PAPER MUTE AND WHITE
ALL DEAD PAPER MUTE AND WHITE
XLIV BELOVED THOU HAST BROUGHT ME MANY FLOWERS PLUCKED IN THE GARDEN ALL THE SUMMER THROUGH AND WINTER AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY GREW IN THIS CLOSE ROOM NOR MISSED THE SUN AND SHOWERS
XXIX I THINK OF THEE!--MY THOUGHTS DO TWINE AND BUD ABOUT THEE AS WILD VINES ABOUT A TREE PUT OUT BROAD LEAVES AND SOON THERE'S NOUGHT TO SEE EXCEPT THE STRAGGLING GREEN WHICH HIDES THE WOOD
THERE'S A VOICE WITHIN THAT WEEPS AS THOU MUST SING ALONE ALOOF
LET ME COUNT THE WAYS
I AM SAFE AND STRONG AND GLAD
THOU BETHINK THEE ART A GUEST FOR QUEENS TO SOCIAL PAGEANTRIES WITH GAGES FROM A HUNDRED BRIGHTER EYES THAN TEARS EVEN CAN MAKE MINE TO PLAY THY PART OF CHIEF MUSICIAN
SAY THOU DOST LOVE ME LOVE ME LOVE ME--TOLL THE SILVER ITERANCE!--ONLY MINDING DEAR TO LOVE ME ALSO IN SILENCE WITH THY SOUL
AND A VOICE SAID IN MASTERY WHILE I STROVE GUESS NOW WHO HOLDS THEE!"--"DEATH I SAID BUT THERE THE SILVER ANSWER RANG NOT DEATH BUT LOVE II BUT ONLY THREE IN ALL GOD'S UNIVERSE HAVE HEARD THIS WORD THOU HAST SAID,--HIMSELF BESIDE THEE SPEAKING AND ME LISTENING
BECAUSE IN THIS DEEP JOY TO SEE AND HEAR THEE AND BREATHE WITHIN THY SHADOW A NEW AIR I DO NOT THINK OF THEE--I AM TOO NEAR THEE
WHERE THE DANCERS WILL BREAK FOOTING FROM THE CARE OF WATCHING UP THY PREGNANT LIPS FOR MORE
I THOUGHT THE FUNERAL-SHEARS WOULD TAKE THIS FIRST BUT LOVE IS JUSTIFIED TAKE IT THOU,--FINDING PURE FROM ALL THOSE YEARS THE KISS MY MOTHER LEFT HERE WHEN SHE DIED
GO FARTHER
YET STILL MY HEART GOES TO THEE--PONDER HOW NOT AS TO A SINGLE GOOD BUT ALL MY GOOD
V I LIFT MY HEAVY HEART UP SOLEMNLY AS ONCE ELECTRA HER SEPULCHRAL URN AND LOOKING IN THINE EYES I OVER-TURN THE ASHES AT THY FEET
AND LOOKING ON MYSELF I SEEMED NOT ONE FOR SUCH MAN'S LOVE!--MORE LIKE AN OUT-OF-TUNE WORN VIOL A GOOD SINGER WOULD BE WROTH TO SPOIL HIS SONG WITH AND WHICH SNATCHED IN HASTE IS LAID DOWN AT THE FIRST ILL-SOUNDING NOTE
SINCE WHEN INDEED I HAVE BEEN PROUD AND SAID MY LOVE MY OWN XXXIX BECAUSE THOU HAST THE POWER AND OWN'ST THE GRACE TO LOOK THROUGH AND BEHIND THIS MASK OF ME AGAINST WHICH YEARS HAVE BEAT THUS BLANCHINGLY WITH THEIR RAINS AND BEHOLD MY SOUL'S TRUE FACE THE DIM AND WEARY WITNESS OF LIFE'S RACE BECAUSE THOU HAST THE FAITH AND LOVE TO SEE THROUGH THAT SAME SOUL'S DISTRACTING LETHARGY THE PATIENT ANGEL WAITING FOR A PLACE IN THE NEW HEAVENS,--BECAUSE NOR SIN NOR WOE NOR GOD'S INFLICTION NOR DEATH'S NEIGHBOURHOOD NOR ALL WHICH OTHERS VIEWING TURN TO GO NOR ALL WHICH MAKES ME TIRED OF ALL SELF-VIEWED NOTHING REPELS THEE DEAREST TEACH ME SO TO POUR OUT GRATITUDE AS THOU DOST GOOD
AND WHAT I FEEL ACROSS THE INFERIOR FEATURES OF WHAT I AM DOTH FLASH ITSELF AND SHOW HOW THAT GREAT WORK OF LOVE ENHANCES NATURE'S
IT ONLY MAY NOW SHADE ON TWO PALE CHEEKS THE MARK OF TEARS TAUGHT DROOPING FROM THE HEAD THAT HANGS ASIDE THROUGH SORROW'S TRICK
I AM THINE BUT SO MUCH TO THEE
VI GO FROM ME
TO LET THEE SIT BENEATH THE FALL OF TEARS AS SALT AS MINE AND HEAR THE SIGHING YEARS RE-SIGHING ON MY LIPS RENUNCIATIVE THROUGH THOSE INFREQUENT SMILES WHICH FAIL TO LIVE FOR ALL THY ADJURATIONS
XX BELOVED MY BELOVED WHEN I THINK THAT THOU WAST IN THE WORLD A YEAR AGO WHAT TIME I SAT ALONE HERE IN THE SNOW AND SAW NO FOOTPRINT HEARD THE SILENCE SINK NO MOMENT AT THY VOICE BUT LINK BY LINK WENT COUNTING ALL MY CHAINS AS IF THAT SO THEY NEVER COULD FALL OFF AT ANY BLOW STRUCK BY THY POSSIBLE HAND,--WHY THUS I DRINK OF LIFE'S GREAT CUP OF WONDER
AND AS A VANQUISHED SOLDIER YIELDS HIS SWORD TO ONE WHO LIFTS HIM FROM THE BLOODY EARTH EVEN SO BELOVED I AT LAST RECORD HERE ENDS MY STRIFE
BUT I LOOK ON THEE--ON THEE BEHOLDING BESIDES LOVE THE END OF LOVE HEARING OBLIVION BEYOND MEMORY
XXIX I THINK OF THEE!--MY THOUGHTS DO TWINE AND BUD XXX I SEE THINE IMAGE THROUGH MY TEARS TO-NIGHT XXXI THOU COMEST
XVI AND YET BECAUSE THOU OVERCOMEST SO BECAUSE THOU ART MORE NOBLE AND LIKE A KING THOU CANST PREVAIL AGAINST MY FEARS AND FLING THY PURPLE ROUND ME TILL MY HEART SHALL GROW TOO CLOSE AGAINST THINE HEART HENCEFORTH TO KNOW HOW IT SHOOK WHEN ALONE
LET ME HEAR THE NAME I USED TO RUN AT WHEN A CHILD FROM INNOCENT PLAY AND LEAVE THE COWSLIPS PLIED TO GLANCE UP IN SOME FACE THAT PROVED ME DEAR WITH THE LOOK OF ITS EYES
NOT COLD,--BUT VERY POOR INSTEAD
I SEEK NO COPY NOW OF LIFE'S FIRST HALF
VII THE FACE OF ALL THE WORLD IS CHANGED I THINK SINCE FIRST I HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS OF THY SOUL MOVE STILL OH STILL BESIDE ME AS THEY STOLE BETWIXT ME AND THE DREADFUL OUTER BRINK OF OBVIOUS DEATH WHERE I WHO THOUGHT TO SINK WAS CAUGHT UP INTO LOVE AND TAUGHT THE WHOLE OF LIFE IN A NEW RHYTHM
NAY IS WORSE FROM GOD THAN FROM ALL OTHERS O MY FRIEND
DEEP THANKS TO ALL WHO PAUSED A LITTLE NEAR THE PRISON-WALL TO HEAR MY MUSIC IN ITS LOUDER PARTS ERE THEY WENT ONWARD EACH ONE TO THE MART'S OR TEMPLE'S OCCUPATION BEYOND CALL
IF THY FOOT IN SCORN COULD TREAD THEM OUT TO DARKNESS UTTERLY IT MIGHT BE WELL PERHAPS
O MY FEARS THAT THIS CAN SCARCE BE RIGHT
GOD'S WILL DEVOTES THINE TO SUCH ENDS AND MINE TO WAIT ON THINE
XV ACCUSE ME NOT BESEECH THEE THAT I WEAR TOO CALM AND SAD A FACE IN FRONT OF THINE
IT IS THAT DISTANT YEARS WHICH DID NOT TAKE THY SOVRANTY RECOILING WITH A BLOW HAVE FORCED MY SWIMMING BRAIN TO UNDERGO THEIR DOUBT AND DREAD AND BLINDLY TO FORSAKE THY PURITY OF LIKENESS AND DISTORT THY WORTHIEST LOVE TO A WORTHLESS COUNTERFEIT
SLOW TO WORLD-GREETINGS QUICK WITH ITS O LIST WHEN THE ANGELS SPEAK
AND AS I MUSED IT IN HIS ANTIQUE TONGUE I SAW IN GRADUAL VISION THROUGH MY TEARS THE SWEET SAD YEARS THE MELANCHOLY YEARS THOSE OF MY OWN LIFE WHO BY TURNS HAD FLUNG A SHADOW ACROSS ME
AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILLED A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR O LOVE O TROTH LEST THESE ENCLASPED HANDS SHOULD NEVER HOLD THIS MUTUAL KISS DROP DOWN BETWEEN US BOTH AS AN UNOWNED THING ONCE THE LIPS BEING COLD
LET IT SERVE TO TRAMPLE ON
I LOVE THEE--IN THY SIGHT I STAND TRANSFIGURED GLORIFIED ARIGHT WITH CONSCIENCE OF THE NEW RAYS THAT PROCEED OUT OF MY FACE TOWARD THINE
WHY CONQUERING MAY PROVE AS LORDLY AND COMPLETE A THING IN LIFTING UPWARD AS IN CRUSHING LOW
AND THIS O LOVE THY WORDS HAVE ILL AVAILED IF WHAT THIS SAID I DARED REPEAT AT LAST
AND THUS I CANNOT SPEAK OF LOVE EVEN AS A GOOD THING OF MY OWN
XIII AND WILT THOU HAVE ME FASHION INTO SPEECH THE LOVE I BEAR THEE FINDING WORDS ENOUGH AND HOLD THE TORCH OUT WHILE THE WINDS ARE ROUGH BETWEEN OUR FACES TO CAST LIGHT ON EACH I DROP IT AT THY FEET
IF TO CONQUER LOVE HAS TRIED TO CONQUER GRIEF TRIES MORE AS ALL THINGS PROVE FOR GRIEF INDEED IS LOVE AND GRIEF BESIDE
NOT SO
THEN LOVE ME LOVE
AND WHEN I SAY AT NEED I LOVE THEE MARK
GOD ONLY WHO MADE US RICH CAN MAKE US POOR
O BEYOND MEED
OUR MINISTERING TWO ANGELS LOOK SURPRISE ON ONE ANOTHER AS THEY STRIKE ATHWART THEIR WINGS IN PASSING
AS ONE WHO STANDS IN DEWLESS ASPHODEL LOOKS BACKWARD ON THE TEDIOUS TIME HE HAD IN THE UPPER LIFE,--SO I WITH BOSOM-SWELL MAKE WITNESS HERE BETWEEN THE GOOD AND BAD THAT LOVE AS STRONG AS DEATH RETRIEVES AS WELL
THIS SAID I AM THINE--AND SO ITS INK HAS PALED WITH LYING AT MY HEART THAT BEAT TOO FAST
O BELOVED IT IS PLAIN I AM NOT OF THY WORTH NOR FOR THY PLACE
OR DID I SEE ALL THE GLORY AS I DREAMED AND FAINTED WHEN TOO VEHEMENT LIGHT DILATED MY IDEAL FOR MY SOUL'S EYES
UNLIKE OUR USES AND OUR DESTINIES
THE CHRISM IS ON THINE HEAD,--ON MINE THE DEW AND DEATH MUST DIG THE LEVEL WHERE THESE AGREE
WHAT I DO AND WHAT I DREAM INCLUDE THEE AS THE WINE MUST TASTE OF ITS OWN GRAPES
A HOPE TO SING BY GLADLY
WE ARE NOT PEERS SO TO BE LOVERS
BUT SOON THEIR TRAILING PURPLE WAS NOT FREE OF THIS WORLD'S DUST THEIR LUTES DID SILENT GROW AND I MYSELF GREW FAINT AND BLIND BELOW THEIR VANISHING EYES
BELOVED DOST THOU LOVE
THERE'S NOTHING LOW IN LOVE WHEN LOVE THE LOWEST
STAND FURTHER OFF THEN
CAN I POUR THY WINE WHILE MY HANDS TREMBLE
I BARTER CURL FOR CURL UPON THAT MART AND FROM MY POET'S FOREHEAD TO MY HEART RECEIVE THIS LOCK WHICH OUTWEIGHS ARGOSIES AS PURPLY BLACK AS ERST TO PINDAR'S EYES THE DIM PURPUREAL TRESSES GLOOMED ATHWART THE NINE WHITE MUSE-BROWS
XXVI I LIVED WITH VISIONS FOR MY COMPANY INSTEAD OF MEN AND WOMEN YEARS AGO AND FOUND THEM GENTLE MATES NOR THOUGHT TO KNOW A SWEETER MUSIC THAN THEY PLAYED TO ME
LOOK UP AND SEE THE CASEMENT BROKEN IN THE BATS AND OWLETS BUILDERS IN THE ROOF
NEITHER LOVE ME FOR THINE OWN DEAR PITY'S WIPING MY CHEEKS DRY A CREATURE MIGHT FORGET TO WEEP WHO BORE THY COMFORT LONG AND LOSE THY LOVE THEREBY
XIX THE SOUL'S RIALTO HATH ITS MERCHANDIZE
BECAUSE GOD'S GIFTS PUT MAN'S BEST DREAMS TO SHAME
ON ME THOU LOOKEST WITH NO DOUBTING CARE AS ON A BEE SHUT IN A CRYSTALLINE
YET I FEEL THAT I SHALL STAND VII THE FACE OF ALL THE WORLD IS CHANGED I THINK VIII WHAT CAN I GIVE THEE BACK O LIBERAL IX CAN IT BE RIGHT TO GIVE WHAT I CAN GIVE
SINCE SORROW HATH SHUT ME SAFE IN LOVE'S DIVINE AND TO SPREAD WING AND FLY IN THE OUTER AIR WERE MOST IMPOSSIBLE FAILURE IF I STROVE TO FAIL SO
AND THIS THIS LUTE AND SONG LOVED YESTERDAY THE SINGING ANGELS KNOW ARE ONLY DEAR BECAUSE THY NAME MOVES RIGHT IN WHAT THEY SAY
YES CALL ME BY THAT NAME,--AND I IN TRUTH WITH THE SAME HEART WILL ANSWER AND NOT WAIT
MY CRICKET CHIRPS AGAINST THY MANDOLIN
HUSH CALL NO ECHO UP IN FURTHER PROOF OF DESOLATION
IF THOU INVITE ME FORTH I RISE ABOVE ABASEMENT AT THE WORD
THEN MY SOUL INSTEAD OF DREAMS OF DEATH RESUMES LIFE'S LOWER RANGE
THY SOUL HATH SNATCHED UP MINE ALL FAINT AND WEAK AND PLACED IT BY THEE ON A GOLDEN THRONE AND THAT I LOVE O SOUL WE MUST BE MEEK IS BY THEE ONLY WHOM I LOVE ALONE
XVIII I NEVER GAVE A LOCK OF HAIR AWAY TO A MAN DEAREST EXCEPT THIS TO THEE WHICH NOW UPON MY FINGERS THOUGHTFULLY I RING OUT TO THE FULL BROWN LENGTH AND SAY TAKE IT MY DAY OF YOUTH WENT YESTERDAY
XXIII IS IT INDEED SO
AND WHEN MY FEARS WOULD RISE WITH THY BROAD HEART SERENELY INTERPOSE
OR A FINE SAD MEMORY WITH THY SONGS TO INTERFUSE
THOUGH THE WORD REPEATED SHOULD SEEM A CUCKOO-SONG AS THOU DOST TREAT IT REMEMBER NEVER TO THE HILL OR PLAIN VALLEY AND WOOD WITHOUT HER CUCKOO-STRAIN COMES THE FRESH SPRING IN ALL HER GREEN COMPLETED
THE CUP OF DOLE GOD GAVE FOR BAPTISM I AM FAIN TO DRINK AND PRAISE ITS SWEETNESS SWEET WITH THEE ANEAR
XXVIII MY LETTERS
I CANNOT TEACH MY HAND TO HOLD MY SPIRITS SO FAR OFF FROM MYSELF--ME--THAT I SHOULD BRING THEE PROOF IN WORDS OF LOVE HID IN ME OUT OF REACH
IF I LAY HERE DEAD XXIV LET THE WORLD'S SHARPNESS LIKE A CLASPING KNIFE XXV A HEAVY HEART BELOVED HAVE I BORNE XXVI I LIVED WITH VISIONS FOR MY COMPANY XXVII MY OWN BELOVED WHO HAST LIFTED ME XXVIII MY LETTERS
AND CANST THOU THINK AND BEAR TO LET THY MUSIC DROP HERE UNAWARE IN FOLDS OF GOLDEN FULNESS AT MY DOOR
MY OWN MY OWN WHO CAMEST TO ME WHEN THE WORLD WAS GONE AND I WHO LOOKED FOR ONLY GOD FOUND THEE
INSTRUCT THINE EYES TO KEEP THEIR COLOURS TRUE AND TELL THY SOUL THEIR ROOTS ARE LEFT IN MINE
LET US STAY RATHER ON EARTH BELOVED,--WHERE THE UNFIT CONTRARIOUS MOODS OF MEN RECOIL AWAY AND ISOLATE PURE SPIRITS AND PERMIT A PLACE TO STAND AND LOVE IN FOR A DAY WITH DARKNESS AND THE DEATH-HOUR ROUNDING IT
XXX I SEE THINE IMAGE THROUGH MY TEARS TO-NIGHT AND YET TO-DAY I SAW THEE SMILING
DO NOT SAY I LOVE HER FOR HER SMILE--HER LOOK--HER WAY OF SPEAKING GENTLY,--FOR A TRICK OF THOUGHT THAT FALLS IN WELL WITH MINE AND CERTES BROUGHT A SENSE OF PLEASANT EASE ON SUCH A DAY FOR THESE THINGS IN THEMSELVES BELOVED MAY BE CHANGED OR CHANGE FOR THEE,--AND LOVE SO WROUGHT MAY BE UNWROUGHT SO
IS THE SAME THE SAME PERPLEXED AND RUFFLED BY LIFE'S STRATEGY
LET IT PASS
AND WOULD THE SUN FOR THEE MORE COLDLY SHINE BECAUSE OF GRAVE-DAMPS FALLING ROUND MY HEAD
I MISS THE CLEAR FOND VOICES WHICH BEING DRAWN AND RECONCILED INTO THE MUSIC OF HEAVEN'S UNDEFILED CALL ME NO LONGER
AND YET THEY SEEM ALIVE AND QUIVERING AGAINST MY TREMULOUS HANDS WHICH LOOSE THE STRING AND LET THEM DROP DOWN ON MY KNEE TO-NIGHT
QUICK-LOVING HEARTS I THOUGHT MAY QUICKLY LOATHE
THEN THOU DIDST BID ME BRING AND LET IT DROP ADOWN THY CALMLY GREAT DEEP BEING
AN EQUAL LIGHT LEAPS IN THE FLAME FROM CEDAR-PLANK OR WEED
INDEED THOSE BEDS AND BOWERS BE OVERGROWN WITH BITTER WEEDS AND RUE AND WAIT THY WEEDING
LET ME HEAR XXXIV WITH THE SAME HEART I SAID I'LL ANSWER THEE XXXV IF I LEAVE ALL FOR THEE WILT THOU EXCHANGE XXXVI WHEN WE MET FIRST AND LOVED I DID NOT BUILD XXXVII PARDON OH PARDON THAT MY SOUL SHOULD MAKE XXXVIII FIRST TIME HE KISSED ME HE BUT ONLY KISSED XXXIX BECAUSE THOU HAST THE POWER AND OWN'ST THE GRACE XL OH YES
I WILL NOT SOIL THY PURPLE WITH MY DUST NOR BREATHE MY POISON ON THY VENICE-GLASS NOR GIVE THEE ANY LOVE--WHICH WERE UNJUST
XXXIII YES CALL ME BY MY PET-NAME
MEANEST CREATURES WHO LOVE GOD GOD ACCEPTS WHILE LOVING SO
AM I COLD UNGRATEFUL THAT FOR THESE MOST MANIFOLD HIGH GIFTS I RENDER NOTHING BACK AT ALL
VERY WHITELY STILL THE LILIES OF OUR LIVES MAY REASSURE THEIR BLOSSOMS FROM THEIR ROOTS ACCESSIBLE ALONE TO HEAVENLY DEWS THAT DROP NOT FEWER
AND WHEN I SUE GOD FOR MYSELF HE HEARS THAT NAME OF THINE AND SEES WITHIN MY EYES THE TEARS OF TWO
XXXVIII FIRST TIME HE KISSED ME HE BUT ONLY KISSED THE FINGERS OF THIS HAND WHEREWITH I WRITE
THIS FIXED A DAY IN SPRING TO COME AND TOUCH MY HAND A SIMPLE THING YET I WEPT FOR IT!--THIS THE PAPER'S LIGHT SAID DEAR I LOVE THEE
AND DOST THOU LIFT THIS HOUSE'S LATCH TOO POOR FOR HAND OF THINE
XII INDEED THIS VERY LOVE WHICH IS MY BOAST AND WHICH WHEN RISING UP FROM BREAST TO BROW DOTH CROWN ME WITH A RUBY LARGE ENOW TO DRAW MEN'S EYES AND PROVE THE INNER COST THIS LOVE EVEN ALL MY WORTH TO THE UTTERMOST I SHOULD NOT LOVE WITHAL UNLESS THAT THOU HADST SET ME AN EXAMPLE SHOWN ME HOW WHEN FIRST THINE EARNEST EYES WITH MINE WERE CROSSED AND LOVE CALLED LOVE
