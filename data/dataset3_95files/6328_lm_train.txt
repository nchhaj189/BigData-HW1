I THEREFORE LET GO THE CORD AND LEAVING THE HOOKS FIXED TO THE SHIPS I RESOLUTELY CUT WITH MY KNIFE THE CABLES THAT FASTENED THE ANCHORS RECEIVING ABOVE TWO HUNDRED SHOTS IN MY FACE AND HANDS
I REMAINED UPON THE TREE TILL IT WAS DAY AND THEN CAME DOWN MORE LIKE A DEAD MAN THAN ONE ALIVE EXPECTING THE SAME FATE WITH MY TWO COMPANIONS
AND CONSIDERED LORD
AND IF YOU WOULD TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WOULD PART ALSO WITH THE RING AND NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH GENIES WHO AS OUR PROPHET HAS TOLD US ARE ONLY DEVILS WITH YOUR LEAVE MOTHER REPLIED ALADDIN I SHALL NOW TAKE CARE HOW I SELL A LAMP WHICH MAY BE SO SERVICEABLE BOTH TO YOU AND ME
NOW WHISPERED THE MAN AT BERTRAM'S LEFT SHAKE OFF THAT FELLOW AND FOLLOW ME BERTRAM WITH A VIOLENT AND SUDDEN EFFORT BURST AWAY FROM THE MAN ON HIS RIGHT AND CLOSELY FOLLOWING HIS MYSTERIOUS FRIEND ATTENDED BY THE FAITHFUL DINMONT WHO NEVER LEFT HIM RAN QUICKLY DOWN A NARROW LANE WHICH LED FROM THE MAIN STREET
THAT THE SAID MAN-MOUNTAIN SHALL IN TWO MOONS TIME DELIVER IN AN EXACT SURVEY OF THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF OUR DOMINIONS BY A COMPUTATION OF HIS OWN PACES ROUND THE COAST
I REMEMBERED THE SAYING OF THE GREAT SOLOMON WHICH I HAD FREQUENTLY HEARD FROM MY FATHER A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN PRECIOUS OINTMENT
WE HOPE WHEN YOU LOOK UPON IT YOU WILL PERCEIVE OUR GOOD INTENTION AND BE PLEASED WITH IT
WE HAD A BOAT AT OUR STERN JUST BEFORE THE STORM BUT SHE WAS FAST STAVED BY DASHING AGAINST THE SHIP'S RUDDER AND IN THE NEXT PLACE SHE BROKE AWAY AND EITHER SUNK OR WAS DRIVEN OFF TO SEA
I THEN TOOK MY TURN AND EMBRACED HIM AS MY DELIVERER AND WE REJOICED TOGETHER
THIS CHEERED ME UP A LITTLE TOO AND I BEGAN TO PERSUADE MYSELF IT WAS ALL A DELUSION
FOR THOU ART NOW OUT OF THE WAY
I BELIEVE HE HAD BURIED THEM BOTH IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AND AFTER THIS MADE ALL THE SIGNS TO ME OF SUBJECTION SERVITUDE AND SUBMISSION IMAGINABLE TO LET ME KNOW HOW HE WOULD SERVE ME SO LONG AS HE LIVED
I WAS AT FIRST READY TO SINK DOWN WITH THE SURPRISE
SIX OF THE CREW OF WHOM I WAS ONE HAVING LET DOWN THE BOAT INTO THE SEA MADE A SHIFT TO GET CLEAR OF THE SHIP AND THE ROCK
IN THIS APARTMENT WHICH WAS NEAR THE TOP OF THE PRISON HIS FEET WERE CHAINED TO AN IRON BAR FIRMLY FIXED AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SIX INCHES FROM THE FLOOR
AND HE CAME NEARER AND NEARER KNEELING DOWN EVERY TEN OR TWELVE STEPS IN TOKEN OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR SAVING HIS LIFE
HOWEVER MY SPEECH PRODUCED NOTHING ELSE BESIDE A LOUD LAUGHTER WHICH ALL THE RESPECT DUE TO HIS MAJESTY FROM THOSE ABOUT HIM COULD NOT MAKE THEM CONTAIN
I MADE MY OBEISANCE AND PRESENTED THE LETTER AND GIFT
FOR THERE WAS LITTLE OR NOTHING MORE FOR US TO DO IN THIS
AND THAT IT WAS MY PART TO SUBMIT TO BEAR HIS INDIGNATION BECAUSE I HAD SINNED AGAINST HIM
HOWEVER THE CAPTAIN SEEMED TO MAKE SOME DIFFICULTY OF IT AS IF HE DURST NOT LEAVE THEM THERE
THE GUNS WILL FLASH AND THE SWORDS WILL GLITTER IN THE MOONLIGHT SHE THEN ASKED HIM IF HE BORE ANY MALICE TO THE MAN THAT WOUNDED HIM AND ON HAZLEWOOD ASSURING HER THAT HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT SHE SAID
WHETHER AN ISLAND OR THE MAIN WHETHER INHABITED OR NOT INHABITED
TO WHOM IT WAS ANSWERED THEY ARE STANDING WITHOUT THE GATE
AND DIRECTLY HE SAW HER HE LOVED HER AND LEFT HIS OWN LADY UNDER THE SPELL OF THE PURPLE FLOWER
FOR THEY TOOK PROSPERO TO SEA AND WHEN THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM LAND FORCED HIM INTO A LITTLE BOAT WITH NO TACKLE MAST OR SAIL
LOOK WELL AT HIM AND YOU WILL FIND HIM TO BE BOTH THE FICTITIOUS OIL MERCHANT AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GANG OF FORTY ROBBERS
GO AND BRING HIM IF YOU MEET WITH HIM ALADDIN WAS JUST READY TO GO WHEN THE MAGICIAN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND CAME IN LOADED WITH WINE AND ALL SORTS OF FRUITS WHICH HE BROUGHT FOR A DESSERT
FOR WHAT DID YOU BRING YOURSELF INTO THIS CONDITION
TREES ALSO GROW HERE MOST OF WHICH ARE OF WOOD OF ALOES EQUAL IN GOODNESS TO THOSE OF COMARI
VERY OFTEN THE CHIEF MINISTERS THEMSELVES ARE COMMANDED TO SHOW THEIR SKILL AND TO CONVINCE THE EMPEROR THAT THEY HAVE NOT LOST THEIR FACULTY
HERE SHE SAID HERE BE STILL AND YOU ARE SAFE
NESBIT THERE WAS ONCE A WICKED DUKE NAMED FREDERICK WHO TOOK THE DUKEDOM THAT SHOULD HAVE BELONGED TO HIS BROTHER SENDING HIM INTO EXILE
IF IT WAS A LITTLE CLEANER I BELIEVE IT WOULD BRING SOMETHING MORE SHE TOOK SOME FINE SAND AND WATER TO CLEAN IT
AND AGAINST HIM THE STRANGER WAS EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL
THE NEXT MORNING AT DAYBREAK THE GENIE PRESENTED HIMSELF AND HAVING OBTAINED ALADDIN'S CONSENT TRANSPORTED HIM IN A MOMENT TO THE PALACE HE HAD MADE
AND WHEN I WAS ASHORE IN OBSERVING THE MANNERS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS LEARNING THEIR LANGUAGE WHEREIN I HAD A GREAT FACILITY BY THE STRENGTH OF MY MEMORY
I WENT TO SEE AND COMFORT HIM IN HIS AFFLICTION AND FINDING HIM ABSORBED IN SORROW I SAID TO HIM AS SOON AS I SAW HIM GOD PRESERVE YOU AND GRANT YOU A LONG LIFE ALAS REPLIED HE HOW DO YOU THINK I SHOULD OBTAIN THE FAVOR YOU WISH ME
IN THIS GREAT EMERGENCY HE SAID THERE IS NO STRENGTH OR POWER BUT IN THE GREAT AND HIGH GOD
WHEN HERMIA WOKE SHE FOUND LYSANDER GONE AND WANDERED ABOUT THE WOOD TRYING TO FIND HIM
WHEN HE HAD PASSED IN AND OUT AS OFTEN AS HE WISHED HE STOOD BEFORE THE DOOR AND PRONOUNCING THE WORDS SHUT SESAME THE DOOR CLOSED OF ITSELF
AND IN THE SPACE OF AN HOUR OR BETTER THAT SIDE OF THE BOX WHERE THE STAPLES WERE AND HAD NO WINDOWS STRUCK AGAINST SOMETHING THAT WAS HARD
AMONGST THE PERSONS WHOM BERTRAM RECALLED THERE WAS HE SAID A TALL THIN KIND-TEMPERED MAN WHO USED TO TEACH ME MY LETTERS AND WALK WITH ME ON HEARING THIS THE POOR DOMINIE COULD CONTAIN HIS FEELINGS NO LONGER AND RISING HASTILY FROM HIS CHAIR WITH CLASPED HANDS TREMBLING LIMBS AND STREAMING EYES HE CALLED OUT ALOUD
I FELL ON MY KNEES AND LIFTED UP MY HANDS AND EYES AND SPOKE SEVERAL WORDS AS LOUD AS I COULD
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT SIGHS AND GROANS BURST FROM CHRISTIAN'S HEART
HIS SHIPS WERE ON NEARLY EVERY SEA AND HE TRADED WITH PORTUGAL WITH MEXICO WITH ENGLAND AND WITH INDIA
HE NEVER LEFT HIS SEAT ALL DAY
AND AFTER ENJOINING ME SECRECY THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD A MIND TO FIT OUT A SHIP TO GO TO GUINEA
HE THOUGHT IT HIS DUTY NOW TO PUNISH AND EXTERMINATE ALL AMONGST THEM WHO WERE POACHERS AND TRESPASSERS AND CAUSED EVEN THE POOR BEGGARS AT HIS DOOR TO BE SENT TO THE WORKHOUSE
AS WE WENT BY THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BURIED THE TWO MEN HE POINTED EXACTLY TO THE PLACE AND SHOWED ME THE MARKS THAT HE HAD MADE TO FIND THEM AGAIN MAKING SIGNS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD DIG THEM UP AGAIN AND EAT THEM
HAVING THEREFORE CONSULTED WITH MY WIFE AND SOME OF MY ACQUAINTANCE I DETERMINED TO GO AGAIN TO SEA
SO THAT I HAD NOW A DOUBLE WALL
HE THEN TURNED HIS STEED UPON ATHELSTANE AND WRENCHING FROM THE HAND OF THE BULKY SAXON THE BATTLE-AXE WHICH HE WIELDED BESTOWED HIM SUCH A BLOW UPON THE CREST THAT THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH ALSO LAY SENSELESS ON THE FIELD
INTO THAT ON THE LEFT SIDE THE KING'S SMITH CONVEYED FOURSCORE AND ELEVEN CHAINS LIKE THOSE THAT HANG TO A LADY'S WATCH IN EUROPE AND ALMOST AS LARGE WHICH WERE LOCKED TO MY LEFT LEG WITH SIX AND THIRTY PADLOCKS
HE LEFT THE APARTMENT SAYING THAT HE WOULD RESCUE HIS FRIENDS OR RETURN AND DIE ALONG WITH THEM
I THEN WITH THE BUTT-END OF MY FOWLING-PIECE RAMMED THE HEAD FARTHER INTO THE THROAT OF THE CROCODILE AND DESTROYED HIM BY SUFFOCATION FOR HE COULD NEITHER GORGE NOR EJECT IT
I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO DIVERT THE EMPEROR ONE DAY AFTER A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MANNER
IN SHORT AFTER A LONG VOYAGE I ARRIVED AT BUSSORAH AND THENCE RETURNED TO BAGDAD WITH SO MUCH WEALTH THAT I KNEW NOT ITS EXTENT
BEING DELIVERED FROM THIS SECOND CAPTIVITY THE SAME DAY OF THE MONTH THAT I FIRST MADE MY ESCAPE IN THE LONG-BOAT FROM AMONG THE MOORS OF SALLEE
THAT MY STORY COULD CONTAIN LITTLE BESIDES COMMON EVENTS WITHOUT THOSE ORNAMENTED DESCRIPTIONS OF STRANGE PLANTS TREES BIRDS AND OTHER ANIMALS
FOR IT WAS WORTH CONSIDERING WHETHER WE MIGHT VENTURE TO TAKE THEM WITH US OR NO ESPECIALLY TWO OF THEM WHOM HE KNEW TO BE INCORRIGIBLE AND REFRACTORY TO THE LAST DEGREE
SO AFTER HE HAD RECEIVED AND GIVEN MANY WOUNDS TO THOSE THAT ATTEMPTED TO KEEP HIM OUT HE CUT HIS WAY THROUGH THEM ALL AND PRESSED FORWARD INTO THE PALACE AT WHICH THERE WAS A PLEASANT VOICE HEARD FROM THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN EVEN OF THOSE THAT WALKED UPON THE TOP OF THE PALACE SAYING COME IN COME IN
BUT SINCE THOU COMPLAINEST OF THY SERVICE AND WAGES BE CONTENT TO GO BACK
WHEN THEY HAD PROCEEDED SOME LITTLE DISTANCE IN THIS WAY BROWN HAPPENED TO MEET THEM
HOW CAME THAT VILE GENIE TO ADDRESS HIMSELF TO ME AND NOT TO YOU TO WHOM HE HAD APPEARED BEFORE IN THE CAVE MOTHER ANSWERED ALADDIN THE GENIE YOU SAW IS NOT THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO ME
TO PLAY SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS IS THE HEIGHT OF AN ACTOR'S AMBITION
DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED BETWEEN THEM HE LEARNED FROM THE SMUGGLER WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOUNG BERTRAM AFTER KENNEDY'S MURDER
ONCE HE SET A BANQUET BEFORE THEM AND JUST AS THEY WERE GOING TO FALL TO HE APPEARED TO THEM AMID THUNDER AND LIGHTNING IN THE FORM OF A HARPY AND IMMEDIATELY THE BANQUET DISAPPEARED
THEN STOPPED AGAIN AND THEN A LITTLE FARTHER AND STOPPED AGAIN
BERTRAM WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE HIS OLD FRIEND WITH HIM AND IN ANSWER TO HIS EAGER INQUIRIES AS TO HOW HE CAME TO BE IN PRISON TOLD HIM ABOUT THE ACCIDENT TO YOUNG HAZLEWOOD AND THAT HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR A SMUGGLER
I HAVE NOT ABOVE AN HOUR TO LIVE FOR I MUST BE BURIED THIS DAY WITH MY WIFE
FOLLOW NO SAID FERDINAND AND DREW HIS SWORD
IN ANSWER I THANKFULLY LAID DOWN THE BOOK AND WAS NO MORE SAD AT LEAST ON THAT OCCASION
WHILE SHE WAS ABSENT AND OUT OF HEARING A SMALL WHITE SPANIEL THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF THE CHIEF GARDENERS HAVING GOT BY ACCIDENT INTO THE GARDEN HAPPENED TO RANGE NEAR THE PLACE WHERE I LAY
SOME GREEN BLUE AND PURPLE AND OTHERS YELLOW
THE CALIPH'S LETTER WAS AS FOLLOWS
ACCEPT THEM LADY SHE SAID
SO I WENT TO WORK
HERE THEY MADE US SIT DOWN AND GAVE US A CERTAIN HERB WHICH THEY MADE SIGNS TO US TO EAT
NEITHER DID I FIND THE EMPEROR AT ALL DISPLEASED AND I DISCOVERED BY A CERTAIN ACCIDENT THAT HE WAS VERY GLAD OF MY RESOLUTION AND SO WERE MOST OF HIS MINISTERS
AND AS EVERYBODY OUGHT TO BE PAID FOR THEIR TROUBLE THERE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF GOLD FOR YOU
YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE BEST AND HAVE AS MUCH LIBERTY TO PERFORM YOUR DEVOTIONS AS IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN CELL THE MAGICIAN WHO REALLY DESIRED NOTHING MORE THAN TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF INTO THE PALACE WHERE IT WOULD BE A MUCH EASIER MATTER FOR HIM TO EXECUTE HIS DESIGNS DID NOT LONG EXCUSE HIMSELF FROM ACCEPTING THE OBLIGING OFFER WHICH THE PRINCESS MADE HIM
WELL KEEP ALL THINGS SO IN THY MIND THAT THEY MAY BE AS A GOAD IN THY SIDES TO PRICK THEE FORWARD IN THE WAY THOU MUST GO
BUT HE HAD A KINDLY AND GOOD-NATURED HEART
HE ASKED ME WHAT MY THOUGHTS AND SPECULATIONS WERE WHILE I LAY IN THE MONKEY'S PAW
WHEN I HAD GOT OUT OF DANGER I STOPPED A WHILE TO PICK OUT THE ARROWS THAT STUCK IN MY HANDS AND FACE
BE THAT AS IT MAY AFTER A YEAR'S REST I PREPARED FOR A SIXTH VOYAGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE ENTREATIES OF MY KINDRED AND FRIENDS WHO DID ALL IN THEIR POWER TO DISSUADE ME
TAKE HOLD OF THE RING AND LIFT IT UP
AS I WALKED THROUGH THIS VALLEY I PERCEIVED IT WAS STREWN WITH DIAMONDS SOME OF WHICH WERE OF A SURPRISING BIGNESS
AS SOON AS IT WAS DAWN THE PILGRIM ENTERED THE SMALL APARTMENT WHERE THE JEW WAS STILL ASLEEP
I HAVE SEEN THEIR BLOOD FLOW AND HEARD THEIR DYING GROANS
I BEGGED HIS PATIENCE TO HEAR ME TELL MY STORY WHICH I FAITHFULLY DID FROM THE LAST TIME I LEFT ENGLAND TO THE MOMENT HE FIRST DISCOVERED ME
AND ALTHOUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS DIGNIFIED BY THE POSSESSION OF A CUSTOMHOUSE THE PLACE WAS STILL THE FAVOURITE HAUNT OF A LARGE BODY OF DESPERATE AND DETERMINED SMUGGLERS WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED WERE ASSISTED BY MANY OF THE SMALL SHOPKEEPERS OF THE LOCALITY IN DISPOSING OF THE CONTRABAND GOODS WHICH WERE SURREPTITIOUSLY BROUGHT FROM FOREIGN PARTS
LOOK SAID CHRISTIAN DID I NOT TELL YOU SO
THEN SUPPOSING THEY WERE NOT CANNIBALS YET THEY MIGHT KILL ME AS MANY EUROPEANS WHO HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS HAD BEEN SERVED EVEN WHEN THEY HAD BEEN TEN OR TWENTY TOGETHER--MUCH MORE I THAT WAS BUT ONE AND COULD MAKE LITTLE OR NO DEFENCE
DEEP WAS THE PRINCE'S DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE LEARNT OF THE FALL OF TORQUILSTONE AND THE DEFEAT OF THE KNIGHTS WHO FAILED TO DEFEND IT AND ON WHOSE SUPPORT HE STRONGLY RELIED
I HEARD A CONFUSED NOISE ABOUT ME BUT IN THE POSTURE I LAY COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE SKY
THEY LAY THEREFORE ALL DAY ON SATURDAY IN A LAMENTABLE CASE AS BEFORE
BUT IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO BROWN WHO WAS NOW A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNLUCKY ACCIDENT OF WHICH HIS RASHNESS HAD BEEN THE CAUSE
AND WHAT A FALSE TALE TO TELL IN ORDER TO POSSESS YOURSELF OF WHAT DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU HAVE PATIENCE REPLIED I
BUT GOD BE PRAISED FOR ALL THINGS
THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN REGARDED NOT THEIR SCOFFS HOOTINGS OR ALL THEY COULD SAY TO HIM BUT STILL CONTINUED CRYING WHO WILL CHANGE OLD LAMPS FOR NEW ONES HE REPEATED THIS SO OFTEN WALKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE PALACE THAT THE PRINCESS WHO WAS THEN IN THE HALL WITH THE FOUR-AND-TWENTY WINDOWS HEARING A MAN CRY SOMETHING AND SEEING A GREAT MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SENT ONE OF HER WOMEN SLAVES TO KNOW WHAT HE CRIED
HOWEVER I SUPPOSE TO PACIFY ME HE PROMISED TO GIVE ORDER AS I DESIRED AND GOING UPON DECK SENT SOME OF HIS MEN DOWN INTO MY CLOSET WHENCE AS I AFTERWARD FOUND THEY DREW UP ALL MY GOODS AND STRIPPED OFF THE QUILTING
GLUMDALCLITCH AND I WERE MUCH FATIGUED
I WAS AT A STRANGE LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND RESOLVED TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE OBSERVING IT TO SEE IF NOTHING FROM THE SETS OF THE TIDE HAD OCCASIONED IT
MY BUSINESS WAS TO HOLD MY BREATH AND RAISE MYSELF UPON THE WATER IF I COULD
CHILD SAID SHE I HAVE NOT A BIT OF BREAD TO GIVE YOU
GULLIVER IN THE LAND OF THE GIANTS BY JONATHAN SWIFT THE ADVENTURE HAD A VERY PROSPEROUS GALE TILL WE ARRIVED AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHERE WE LANDED FOR FRESH WATER
SO ARE THE MEN OF THIS WORLD
WHILE ON THE LEAD ONE WERE THESE WORDS:--"WHO CHOOSETH ME MUST GIVE AND HAZARD ALL HE HATH THE PRINCE OF MOROCCO AS BRAVE AS HE WAS BLACK WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO SUBMIT TO THIS TEST
THE EMPEROR CONCLUDED ME TO BE DROWNED AND THAT THE ENEMY'S FLEET WAS APPROACHING IN A HOSTILE MANNER
AT LENGTH HE CAME CLOSE TO ME AND THEN HE KNEELED DOWN AGAIN KISSED THE GROUND AND LAID HIS HEAD UPON THE GROUND AND TAKING ME BY THE FOOT SET MY FOOT UPON HIS HEAD
MEANWHILE CEDRIC THE SAXON WHEN HE SAW HIS SON DROP DOWN SENSELESS IN THE LISTS AT ASHBY HAD GIVEN ORDERS HALF IN PITY HALF IN ANGER TO HIS ATTENDANTS TO CONVEY IVANHOE TO A PLACE WHERE HIS WOUND MIGHT BE DRESSED AS SOON AS THE CROWD HAD DISPERSED
BUT WHEN GANYMEDE HEARD OF THE DANGER ORLANDO HAD BEEN IN SHE FAINTED
AND I COULD THEN PERCEIVE THAT HE STOOD TREMBLING AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER AND HAD JUST BEEN SENTENCED TO BE KILLED AS HIS TWO ENEMIES WERE
IT WAS AT LEAST FIFTY PACES ROUND
THIS I MENTION AS AN INSTANCE OF THE GREAT POWER OF HABIT AND PREJUDICE
WHEREUPON HIS MAJESTY COMMANDED THE MASTER OF HIS WOODS TO GIVE DIRECTIONS ACCORDINGLY AND THE NEXT MORNING SIX WOODMEN ARRIVED WITH AS MANY CARRIAGES DRAWN BY EIGHT HORSES TO EACH
NOT LONG AFTER THE PROPER OFFICER BROUGHT THE BIER AND WHEN THE ATTENDANTS OF THE MOSQUE WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO WASH THE DEAD OFFERED TO PERFORM THEIR DUTY SHE TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS DONE ALREADY
NOW BASSANIO LIKE MANY ANOTHER GAY AND GALLANT GENTLEMAN WAS RECKLESS AND EXTRAVAGANT AND FINDING THAT HE HAD NOT ONLY COME TO THE END OF HIS FORTUNE BUT WAS ALSO UNABLE TO PAY HIS CREDITORS HE WENT TO ANTONIO FOR FURTHER HELP
THERE APPEARED BEFORE ME A LITTLE OPENING OF THE LAND AND I FOUND A STRONG CURRENT OF THE TIDE SET INTO IT
AND THAT IT WAS BY HER ORDERS THAT THREE OR FOUR OF THE GIPSIES HAD MINGLED IN THE CROWD WHEN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE WAS ATTACKED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING BERTRAM TO ESCAPE
I LOOKED THEN AND SAW A MAN NAMED EVANGELIST COMING TO HIM AND ASKED WHEREFORE DOST THOU CRY
COME THEN WITH ME UNTIL I GATHER MORE AID SO SAYING HE WALKED THROUGH THE WOOD AT A GREAT PACE FOLLOWED BY THE JESTER AND THE SWINEHERD
AS IT WAS THE MONEY-LENDER FORFEITED HALF HIS FORTUNE TO THE STATE AND HE HAD TO SETTLE THE OTHER HALF ON HIS DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND AND WITH THIS HE HAD TO BE CONTENT
WHATEVER THEY HAVE THEY OWE TO CHANCE
AS SOON AS I THROW SOME STONES OUT OF THE CHAMBER WINDOW WHERE I LIE DO NOT FAIL TO COME OUT AND I WILL IMMEDIATELY JOIN YOU AFTER THIS HE RETURNED INTO THE HOUSE WHEN MORGIANA TAKING UP A LIGHT CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS CHAMBER WHERE SHE LEFT HIM
I THOUGHT IT MY PART TO OBEY AND FOR FEAR OF FALLING LAID MYSELF AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH THE REMAINDER OF WHICH HE LAPPED ME UP TO THE HEAD FOR FURTHER SECURITY AND IN THIS MANNER CARRIED ME HOME TO HIS HOUSE
AND YE HAVE NOTHING TO EXPECT FROM THE TEMPTER WHAT AM I TO DO THEN SAID THE SMUGGLER WITH A DUTCH OATH
HAVING ACHIEVED THIS DOUBLE FEAT HE RETURNED CALMLY TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS LEAVING HIS LEADER TO COPE AS BEST HE COULD WITH BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT
WHEN ALADDIN FOUND HIMSELF SO HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED HE RETURNED HIS UNCLE THANKS WHO THUS ADDRESSED HIM
AND THE CAPTAIN AND ALL OF THEM THOUGHT IT MUST SUCCEED
WITH THIS ATTENDANCE AND IN THIS PLENTIFUL MANNER I LIVED
ONLY THERE SAT A CREATURE LIKE A WILD CAT UPON ONE OF THE CHESTS WHICH WHEN I CAME TOWARDS IT RAN AWAY A LITTLE DISTANCE AND THEN STOOD STILL
AND HERE TOO THE CHALLENGERS CAME OFF VICTORIOUS
AND THUS I LAY TILL THE WATER EBBED AWAY AND LEFT MY RAFT AND ALL MY CARGO SAFE ON SHORE
WHAT DO YE GLOWER AFTER OUR FOLK FOR
HE NEVER QUITTED THOSE HE HAD ONCE MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF TILL HE HAD DESTROYED THEM AND HE HAS MADE THIS ISLAND NOTORIOUS BY THE NUMBER OF MEN HE HAS SLAIN THEY CARRIED ME WITH THEM TO THE CAPTAIN WHO RECEIVED ME WITH GREAT KINDNESS
GO THEREFORE BOLDLY AND WE SHALL BOTH BE RICH ALL OUR LIVES ALADDIN DESCENDED THE STEPS AND OPENING THE DOOR FOUND THE THREE HALLS JUST AS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN HAD DESCRIBED
SO I LOOKED UP IN MY DREAM AND SAW THE CLOUDS RACK AT AN UNUSUAL RATE UPON WHICH I HEARD A GREAT SOUND OF A TRUMPET AND SAW ALSO A MAN SIT UPON A CLOUD ATTENDED WITH THE THOUSANDS OF HEAVEN
I HAVE BEEN FORTY YEARS ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS MY NATIVE PLACE AS WELL AS MY LATE BROTHER'S
SO LAY STILL IN MY CASTLE PERPLEXED AND DISCOMFORTED
THE TEMPLAR'S HORSE HAD BLED MUCH AND GAVE WAY UNDER THE SHOCK OF THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT'S CHARGE
I WOULD SPEAK WITH THIS MAN ALONE
A HUNDRED VOICES EXCLAIMED A CHAMPION
HE TOLD HIM HE SHOULD BE WELCOME AND IMMEDIATELY OPENED HIS GATES FOR THE MULES TO GO INTO THE YARD
AND ON THOSE DAYS ON WHICH SHE COMES INTO THE TOWN SHE DOES AN INFINITE DEAL OF GOOD
HERE THE EMPEROR ASCENDED WITH MANY PRINCIPAL LORDS OF HIS COURT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF VIEWING ME AS I WAS TOLD FOR I COULD NOT SEE THEM
BUT WHEN WE GOT OUT TO SEA WE WERE EXPOSED TO THE MERCY OF THE WAVES AND WINDS AND SPENT THAT DAY AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT UNDER THE MOST PAINFUL UNCERTAINTY AS TO OUR FATE
BUT THE MAN NOT AT ALL DISCOURAGED FELL TO CUTTING AND HACKING MOST FIERCELY
SHE WOULD ONLY ACCEPT THAT SUITOR WHO WOULD PLEDGE HIMSELF TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF HER FATHER'S WILL
AND RISING FROM HIS THRONE ORDERED THAT THE PRINCESS'S ATTENDANTS SHOULD COME AND CARRY THE TRAYS INTO THEIR MISTRESS'S APARTMENT WHITHER HE WENT HIMSELF TO EXAMINE THEM WITH HER AT HIS LEISURE
HE IS AS MUCH ONE AS I AM
AND AS I THOUGHT THE JUDGE HAD ALWAYS HIS EYE UPON ME SHEWING INDIGNATION IN HIS COUNTENANCE
THERE WAS A HILL NOT ABOVE A MILE FROM ME WHICH ROSE UP VERY STEEP AND HIGH AND WHICH SEEMED TO OVERTOP SOME OTHER HILLS WHICH LAY AS IN A RIDGE FROM IT NORTHWARD
AS THE SHIP LAY ALMOST TWO LEAGUES FROM THE SHORE WE HAD A FULL VIEW OF THEM AS THEY CAME AND A PLAIN SIGHT EVEN OF THEIR FACES
WE COULD HEAR THEM CALL ONE TO ANOTHER IN A MOST LAMENTABLE MANNER TELLING ONE ANOTHER THEY WERE GOT INTO AN ENCHANTED ISLAND
THE MEN THEN ASKED WHAT MUST WE DO IN THE HOLY PLACE
HE SHALL HAVE NOTHING BUT HIS BOND YOU A FOREIGNER SHE ADDED HAVE SOUGHT TO TAKE THE LIFE OF A VENETIAN CITIZEN AND THUS BY THE VENETIAN LAW YOUR LIFE AND GOODS ARE FORFEITED
HE WAS VERY POOR
IF AN EXPRESS REQUIRES EXTRAORDINARY DISPATCH THE MAN MOUNTAIN SHALL BE OBLIGED TO CARRY IN HIS POCKET THE MESSENGER AND HORSE A SIX DAYS JOURNEY ONCE IN EVERY MOON AND RETURN THE SAID MESSENGER BACK IF SO REQUIRED SAFE TO OUR IMPERIAL PRESENCE
FOR THERE IS NOT ANOTHER TO SUCCEED HE THEREFORE THAT HATH HIS PORTION FIRST MUST NEEDS HAVE A TIME TO SPEND IT
YOUR MASTER'S BODY IS CONTAINED IN THESE TWO PANNIERS
I SWORE AND SUBSCRIBED TO THESE ARTICLES WITH GREAT CHEERFULNESS AND CONTENT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM WERE NOT SO HONORABLE AS I COULD HAVE WISHED
MY FATHER AND I WE ARE GOING TO A FAR COUNTRY WHERE AT LEAST WE SHALL DWELL IN LIBERTY
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THREE ARROWS WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE SUSPECTED SPOT ONE OF WHICH GLANCED OFF THE VISOR OF THE BLACK KNIGHT
BUT BEFORE LEAVING HE TOOK UP A CUTLASS BELONGING TO ONE OF THE FIVE AND BROUGHT IT WITH HIM IN THE BELIEF THAT HE MIGHT YET HAVE TO FIGHT WITH THEM FOR HIS LIFE
BUT NOW I COME TO A NEW SCENE OF MY LIFE
THEY WERE SOON OUTSIDE THE SECRET CAVE
AS IT FORTUNED THE MESSENGER WHO DID HER ERRAND HAD NOT FAR TO GO BEFORE HE MET ISAAC OF YORK
ALL THE ROBBERS LISTENED TO HIM WITH THE UTMOST SATISFACTION
AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS WERE AT WORK IMMEDIATELY CUTTING HIM OPEN FOR THEIR COOKERY WHILE THE OTHER VICTIM WAS LEFT STANDING BY HIMSELF TILL THEY SHOULD BE READY FOR HIM
I FOUND MYSELF NOT VERY WELL AND TOLD THE PAGE THAT I HAD A MIND TO TAKE A NAP IN MY HAMMOCK WHICH I HOPED WOULD DO ME GOOD
WHEN ALADDIN FOUND HIMSELF AT LIBERTY HE AGAIN ADDRESSED THE SULTAN
NOBODY CAME
WE SAILED FROM AMSTERDAM WITH DESPATCHES FROM THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES THE STATES OF HOLLAND AND IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS WE ARRIVED AT CEYLON WHERE WE WERE RECEIVED WITH GREAT MARKS OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRUE POLITENESS
SO HE BEGAN AND SAID THIS NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY SLEEP I DREAMED AND BEHOLD THE HEAVENS GREW EXCEEDING BLACK
FOR A MILE OR THEREABOUTS MY RAFT WENT VERY WELL ONLY THAT I FOUND IT DRIVE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I HAD LANDED BEFORE
NOR DID ANY IN THE SHIP EXPECT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES
AND THEN THEY WOULD HOP BACK UNCONCERNED TO HUNT FOR WORMS OR SNAILS AS THEY DID BEFORE
ITS TRUE AUTHOR IS THE BROTHER OF THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN YOUR ENEMY WHOM YOU HAVE DESTROYED
AND AS FOR THAT MONSTROUS ANIMAL WITH WHOM I WAS SO LATELY ENGAGED IT WAS INDEED AS LARGE AS AN ELEPHANT IF MY FEARS HAD SUFFERED ME TO THINK SO FAR AS TO MAKE USE OF MY HANGER LOOKING FIERCELY AND CLAPPING MY HAND UPON THE HILT AS I SPOKE WHEN HE POKED HIS PAW INTO MY CHAMBER PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM SUCH A WOUND AS WOULD HAVE MADE HIM GLAD TO WITHDRAW IT WITH MORE HASTE THAN HE PUT IT IN
AFTER SOME TIME WHEN THEY OBSERVED THAT I MADE NO MORE DEMANDS FOR MEAT
THE MOTHER OUT OF PURE INDULGENCE TOOK ME UP AND PUT ME TOWARD THE CHILD WHO PRESENTLY SEIZED ME BY THE MIDDLE AND GOT MY HEAD INTO HIS MOUTH WHERE I ROARED SO LOUD THAT THE URCHIN WAS FRIGHTED AND LET ME DROP AND I SHOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE BROKE MY NECK IF THE MOTHER HAD NOT HELD HER APRON UNDER ME
SINDBAD THE SAILOR IN THE REIGN OF THE SAME CALIPH HAROUN-AL-RASCHID OF WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD THERE LIVED AT BAGDAD A POOR PORTER CALLED HINDBAD
HE THAT CASTS WATER UPON IT TO EXTINGUISH AND PUT IT OUT IS THE DEVIL BUT IN THAT THOU SEEST THE FIRE NOTWITHSTANDING BURN HIGHER AND HOTTER THOU SHALT ALSO SEE THE REASON OF THAT
I STOOD STILL A FEW MOMENTS TO RECOVER BREATH AND TILL THE WATERS WENT FROM ME AND THEN TOOK TO MY HEELS AND RAN WITH WHAT STRENGTH I HAD FARTHER TOWARD THE SHORE
ANTONIO DESPISED AND DISLIKED THIS MAN VERY MUCH AND TREATED HIM WITH THE GREATEST HARSHNESS AND SCORN
IT WAS ONLY ONE SUBSTANTIAL DISH OF MEAT FIT FOR THE PLAIN CONDITION OF A HUSBANDMAN IN A DISH OF ABOUT FOUR-AND-TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER
AFTER WHICH AS THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE RESISTANCE SO THEY COULD EXPECT NO MERCY
HAD THEY BEEN ALL OF THE WICKED PART OF THE CREW I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT GOD'S PROVIDENCE HAD SINGLED THEM OUT TO DELIVER THEM INTO YOUR HANDS
FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS THE WRETCHED JEW REMAINED SITTING IN A CORNER OF HIS DUNGEON WHEN STEPS WERE HEARD ON THE STAIR BY WHICH IT WAS APPROACHED
IN THE ENJOYMENT OF WHICH I DID THEN PROMISE MYSELF MUCH DELIGHT
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE GATES THE GRAND VIZIER THE OTHER VIZIERS AND MOST DISTINGUISHED LORDS OF THE COURT WERE JUST GONE IN
ASK HIM SAID THE INTERPRETER
AND IT HAVING BEEN A DAY OF GREAT FATIGUE TO ME I SLEPT SOUND TILL I WAS SURPRISED WITH THE NOISE OF A GUN
AND HE SIGHED AS IF HE WOULD BREAK HIS HEART
ALI BABA KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BY MORGIANA A CLEVER INTELLIGENT SLAVE WHO WAS FRUITFUL IN INVENTIONS TO MEET THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT IT WAS SO DARK AND THE FLOOD WAS SO HIGH THAT IN THEIR GOING BACK THEY HAD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN DROWNED NINE OR TEN TIMES
AND PIQUED TO THE QUICK AT ALADDIN'S HIGH ESTATE HE RETURNED TO THE KHAN
BUT UPON THE NEXT ABOUT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN I HAD BY MY COMPUTATION MADE TWENTY-FOUR LEAGUES FROM BLEFUSCU I DESCRIED A SAIL STEERING TO THE SOUTHEAST
THIS MADE HIM REPENT OF HIS WICKEDNESS AND HE BEGGED ORLANDO'S PARDON AND FROM THENCEFORTH THEY WERE DEAR BROTHERS
AND BEFORE I BEGAN MY SECOND VOYAGE I SOLD THEM FOR SIX HUNDRED POUNDS
ONE DAY THERE WAS A WRESTLING MATCH AT COURT AND ROSALIND AND CELIA WENT TO SEE IT
NOR CAN ALL THE MEN IN THE WORLD LET ME OUT
NEVERTHELESS SAID THE PILGRIM YOU WILL NOT I THINK REFUSE ME THAT FAVOUR SO SAYING HE WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR IN SAXON
THE CAPTAIN WELL SATISFIED WITH HIS ATTEMPT AND INFORMED OF WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW RETURNED TO THE FOREST
AND APOLLYON AS FAST MADE AT HIM THROWING DARTS AS THICK AS HAIL
BUT HE LEARNED ON ASKING ABOUT HIM THAT HE WAS A STRANGER IN THOSE PARTS WHO HAD COME FROM THE SOUTH-WEST OF SCOTLAND AND THAT HIS NAME WAS GABRIEL
AH
TO WHICH THE CAPTAIN AT MY INTERCESSION CAUSED THEIR CHESTS AND CLOTHES TO BE ADDED WHICH THEY TOOK AND WERE VERY THANKFUL FOR
I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I SLEPT BUT WHEN I AWOKE THE SHIP WAS GONE
IT SEEMED AN ENDLESS CAVERN AND MIGHT BE ABOUT FIFTY FATHOMS DEEP
AND WITHAL LAUGHED PATIENCE TO SCORN
CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL ARRIVE AT THE CAELESTIAL CITY BY JOHN BUNYAN I SAW THAT AS THEY WENT ON THERE MET THEM TWO MEN IN RAIMENT THAT SHONE LIKE GOLD ALSO THEIR FACES SHONE AS THE LIGHT
THERE BEING A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF IT HE SOON BEGAN TO SING AND TO MOVE ABOUT FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN HIS SEAT UPON MY SHOULDERS AND BY DEGREES TO LOOSEN HIS LEGS FROM ABOUT ME
WHAT IS MOST REMARKABLE IN THIS PLACE IS THAT THE STONES OF THE MOUNTAIN ARE OF CRYSTAL RUBIES OR OTHER PRECIOUS STONES
UPON THE CAPTAIN COMING TO ME I TOLD HIM MY PROJECT FOR SEIZING THE SHIP WHICH HE LIKED WONDERFULLY WELL AND RESOLVED TO PUT IT IN EXECUTION THE NEXT MORNING
HE PRACTICED THE ARTS OF MAGIC NO MORE BUT HIS LIFE WAS HAPPY AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAD FOUND HIS OWN AGAIN BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE WHEN HIS BITTEREST FOES WHO HAD DONE HIM DEADLY WRONG LAY AT HIS MERCY HE TOOK NO VENGEANCE ON THEM BUT NOBLY FORGAVE THEM
O ETERNITY
SO I CAME BACK FOR THE PRESENT BEING MORE INTENT UPON GETTING AT THE SHIP WHERE I HOPED TO FIND SOMETHING FOR MY PRESENT SUBSISTENCE
BUT ABOVE ALL THE RUBIES AND EMERALDS FOR HE HAD NONE IN HIS TREASURY THAT EQUALLED THEM
AND IF EVER THAT SHOULD COME TO PASS AGAIN FOR MY PART I AM RESOLVED TO PLUCK UP THE HEART OF A MAN AND TO TRY MY UTMOST TO GET FROM UNDER HIS HAND
BUT AGAIN WHEN I FELT THE SMART OF THEIR ARROWS UPON MY FACE AND HANDS WHICH WERE ALL IN BLISTERS AND MANY OF THE DARTS STILL STICKING IN THEM
THAT AS I COULD NOT FORESEE WHAT THE ENDS OF DIVINE WISDOM MIGHT BE IN ALL THIS SO I WAS NOT TO DISPUTE HIS SOVEREIGNTY
TUSH SAID OBSTINATE AWAY WITH YOUR BOOK
I WOULD GLADLY HAVE TAKEN A DOZEN OF THE NATIVES BUT THIS WAS A THING THE EMPEROR WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT
THE WHITE WERE PEARLS
AND THERE WHENEVER I HAD OCCASION TO BE ABSENT FROM MY CHIEF SEAT I TOOK UP MY COUNTRY HABITATION
THAT TO HAVE SEEN ONE OF MY OWN SPECIES WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO ME A RAISING ME FROM DEATH TO LIFE AND THE GREATEST BLESSING THAT HEAVEN ITSELF NEXT TO THE SUPREME BLESSING OF SALVATION COULD BESTOW--I SAY THAT I SHOULD NOW TREMBLE AT THE VERY APPREHENSIONS OF SEEING A MAN AND WAS READY TO SINK INTO THE GROUND AT BUT THE SHADOW OR SILENT APPEARANCE OF A MAN HAVING SET HIS FOOT IN THE ISLAND
THE ROBBERS STAYED SOME TIME WITHIN THE ROCK DURING WHICH ALI BABA FEARFUL OF BEING CAUGHT REMAINED IN THE TREE
AND PRODUCING HIS CREDENTIALS UNDER THE SIGNET ROYAL WHICH HE APPLIED CLOSE TO MY EYES SPOKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES WITHOUT ANY SIGNS OF ANGER BUT WITH A KIND OF DETERMINATE RESOLUTION
ARISE MY LIEGEMEN AND BE GOOD SUBJECTS IN FUTURE
AND NOW I BEGAN TO THINK SEDATELY
DEPART AND HAUNT MY COUCH NO MORE
WHEN I HAD DONE PRAYING I TOOK UP MY BIBLE AND OPENING IT TO READ THE FIRST WORDS THAT PRESENTED TO ME WERE WAIT ON THE LORD AND BE OF GOOD CHEER AND HE SHALL STRENGTHEN THY HEART
TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER HE WAS SETTLED ALI BABA CAME TO SEE HIS SON AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AND SOON LEARNED FROM HIS SON WHO HE WAS
HIS WHOLE NAME WAS HIERONYMUS KARL FRIEDRICH VON MUNCHAUSEN A GERMAN OF COURSE BUT SERVING IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY
WE ROWED BY MY COMPUTATION ABOUT THREE LEAGUES TILL WE WERE ABLE TO WORK NO LONGER BEING ALREADY SPENT WITH LABOR WHILE WE WERE IN THE SHIP
WHEN THEY CAME DIRECTLY OVER MY SHIP THEY HOVERED AND ONE OF THEM LET GO HIS ROCK
AT LAST ONE CAME TO THE DOOR AND ASKED WHO WAS THERE
THE NEXT MAN WAS SHOT IN THE BODY AND FELL JUST BY HIM THOUGH HE DID NOT DIE TILL AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER
BUT BEWARE OF THE FUTURE LEST A WORSE THING BEFALL THEE
WHERE I WAS ABLE TO DRAW AN IMPERIAL FLEET IN MY HAND AND PERFORM THOSE OTHER ACTIONS WHICH WILL BE RECORDED FOREVER IN THE CHRONICLES OF THAT EMPIRE WHILE POSTERITY SHALL HARDLY BELIEVE THEM ALTHOUGH ATTESTED BY MILLIONS
YES SAID CHRISTIAN FOR THAT WAS HIS NAME BECAUSE THAT ALL WHICH YOU SHALL FORSAKE IS NOT WORTHY TO BE COMPARED WITH A LITTLE OF THAT THAT I AM SEEKING TO ENJOY
TAKE CARE MY BATHING LINEN BE READY GIVE THEM TO ABDALLA WHICH WAS THE SLAVE'S NAME AND MAKE ME SOME GOOD BROTH AGAINST I RETURN AFTER THIS HE WENT TO BED
SUCH AS IT IS I HEARTILY OFFER IT SIR REPLIED COGIA HOUSSAIN I AM THOROUGHLY PERSUADED OF YOUR GOOD WILL
IT WAS AFTER THREE HOURS GOOD WALKING THAT THE SERVANTS OF CEDRIC WITH THEIR MYSTERIOUS GUIDE ARRIVED AT A SMALL OPENING IN THE FOREST
THE FIRST CARE OF THE ROBBERS AFTER THIS WAS TO EXAMINE THE CAVE
AND HE AND SHE CONTINUED TO LEAD A QUIET AND NOT UNHAPPY LIFE IN THEIR NEW HOME
WHEN THE HORSES WERE UNABLE TO PROCEED ANY FURTHER BROWN DISMOUNTED FROM THE CARRIAGE IN ORDER TO LOOK FOR A HOUSE WHERE HE COULD ASK THE WAY
THE TALK THAT THEY HAD WITH THE SHINING ONES WAS ABOUT THE GLORY OF THE PLACE WHO TOLD THEM THAT THE BEAUTY AND GLORY OF IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLE
AND I PILED ALL THE EMPTY CHESTS AND CASKS UP IN A CIRCLE ROUND THE TENT TO FORTIFY IT FROM ANY SUDDEN ATTEMPT EITHER FROM MAN OR BEAST
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN I TRUST SAID THE DEFEATED CHAMPION AS HE EXTRICATED HIMSELF FROM THE STIRRUPS AND FALLEN STEED
WHEN HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO LEARN A TRADE HIS FATHER TOOK HIM INTO HIS OWN SHOP AND TAUGHT HIM HOW TO USE HIS NEEDLE
AS INDEED I EXPECTED
I SAT DOWN UPON THE GRASS TO RECOVER MYSELF FROM MY FATIGUE AFTER WHICH I WENT INTO THE ISLAND TO EXPLORE IT
SO HE WENT IN AND WAS CLOATHED WITH SUCH GARMENTS AS THEY
FOR THE SHIP WAS LEAKY AND VERY MUCH DISABLED AND HE WAS FOR GOING DIRECTLY BACK TO THE COAST OF BRAZIL
SO THERE WAS NO HOPE FROM HER
THE NEIGHBORS ALSO CAME OUT TO SEE HIM RUN
BUT AT ONCE SUMMONING UP ALL HER ENERGIES SHE PLACED UPON THE DROOPING HEAD OF THE VICTOR THE SPLENDID CHAPLET WHICH WAS THE DESTINED REWARD OF THE DAY
THE GENIE LED HIM THROUGH ALL THE APARTMENTS WHERE HE FOUND OFFICERS AND SLAVES HABITED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK AND THE SERVICES TO WHICH THEY WERE APPOINTED
AND LOOKING AT COGIA HOUSSAIN KNEW HIM AT FIRST SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS DISGUISE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS AND EXAMINING HIM VERY CAREFULLY PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD A DAGGER UNDER HIS GARMENT
OR IF I ESCAPED THESE DANGERS FOR A DAY OR TWO WHAT COULD I EXPECT BUT A MISERABLE DEATH OF COLD AND HUNGER
I AT LAST ARRIVED SAFE AT BAGDAD AND IMMEDIATELY WAITED UPON THE CALIPH TO GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY EMBASSY
AT LAST WHEN ALL THEIR SIGNALS AND FIRING PROVED FRUITLESS AND THEY FOUND THE BOAT DID NOT STIR WE SAW THEM BY THE HELP OF MY GLASSES HOIST ANOTHER BOAT OUT AND ROW TOWARDS THE SHORE
I LET THEM KNOW THAT BY MY DIRECTION THE SHIP HAD BEEN SEIZED
HE AS WELL AS HIS BROTHER ALWAYS CARRIED A GEOMANTIC SQUARE INSTRUMENT ABOUT HIM
THE PEOPLE WHO GATHERED PEPPER CAME TO MEET ME AS SOON AS THEY SAW ME AND ASKED ME IN ARABIC WHO I WAS AND WHENCE I CAME
AND AS THE EARTH WAS LIGHT THEY WERE NOT LONG IN DOING IT
OH WHAT RIDICULOUS RESOLUTIONS MEN TAKE WHEN POSSESSED WITH FEAR
WHEN THE VISITOR HAD GONE MRS BERTRAM THE MOTHER OF THE BABY BOY WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO READ THE PAPER FOR SHE WAS A SUPERSTITIOUS LADY
MASTER GOD PRESERVE YOU
AND BEFORE HE RELEASED HER FROM THE ENCHANTMENT HE PERSUADED HER TO GIVE HIM THE LITTLE INDIAN BOY HE SO MUCH DESIRED TO HAVE
HE NOTICED TOO THAT THERE WAS A ROLL OF LINEN ABOUT THE DYING MAN'S HEAD WHICH WAS DEEPLY STAINED WITH BLOOD
BUT WHEN THE ROBBER AND HIS CAPTAIN CAME TO THE STREET THEY FOUND THE SAME DIFFICULTY
AND THE FIRST THING DEMETRIUS SAW WHEN HE WOKE WAS ALSO HELENA
THE RUFFIAN WHO INSTANTLY SAW HE WAS BETRAYED TURNED HIS FIRST VENGEANCE ON MEG MERRILIES AT WHOM HE DISCHARGED A PISTOL
BUT THE ONLY EFFECT OF THEIR WORDS WAS TO MAKE HIM WISH MORE TO COME OFF WELL IN THE ENCOUNTER SO AS TO WIN PRAISE FROM SUCH SWEET LADIES
THE SNOW LAY ON THE GROUND AS HE AND THE GIPSY CAME OUT AND AS HE FOLLOWED HER HE NOTICED THAT SHE CHOSE THE TRACK THE MEN HAD TAKEN SO THAT HER FOOTPRINTS MIGHT NOT BE SEEN
WHEN ALL THE MONEY WAS SPENT ALADDIN HAD RECOURSE AGAIN TO THE LAMP
WELL GO YOUR WAYS SAID OBERON
SCRATCH MY HEAD PEASEBLOSSOM SAID THE CLOWN
IT WAS PLAIN TOO FROM THE THICK CLOUDS OF SMOKE THAT ROLLED PAST THE WINDOW THAT THE PRISON WAS ITSELF ON FIRE
FROM WHENCE ONE OF THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE A PERSON OF QUALITY MADE ME A LONG SPEECH WHEREOF I UNDERSTOOD NOT ONE SYLLABLE
AND THEY DID NOT KNOW BUT THAT HE STOOD SENTINEL OVER THEM AT THE ENTRANCE
FOR THE SEA HAVING HURRIED ME ALONG AS BEFORE LANDED ME OR RATHER DASHED ME AGAINST A PIECE OF A ROCK AND THAT WITH SUCH FORCE AS IT LEFT ME SENSELESS AND INDEED HELPLESS AS TO MY OWN DELIVERANCE
THERE WERE SIX AMBASSADORS WITH A TRAIN OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS AND THEIR ENTRY WAS VERY MAGNIFICENT SUITABLE TO THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR MASTER AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR BUSINESS
AND AFTER SOME TIME I THINK IT WAS A YEAR AND A HALF I RAISED RAFTERS FROM IT LEANING TO THE ROCK AND THATCHED OR COVERED IT WITH BOUGHS OF TREES AND SUCH THINGS AS I COULD GET TO KEEP OUT THE RAIN
BUT I MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN THAT I COULD NO MORE TURN HER AND SET HER UPRIGHT UPON HER BOTTOM THAN I COULD REMOVE THE ISLAND
AFTER THIS HE INCREASED HIS ASSIDUITIES CARESSED HIM IN THE MOST ENGAGING MANNER MADE HIM SOME SMALL PRESENTS AND OFTEN ASKED HIM TO DINE AND SUP WITH HIM WHEN HE TREATED HIM VERY HANDSOMELY
WE MADE A LONG MARCH THE REMAINING PART OF THAT DAY AND RESTED AT NIGHT WITH FIVE HUNDRED GUARDS ON EACH SIDE OF ME HALF WITH TORCHES AND HALF WITH BOWS AND ARROWS READY TO SHOOT ME IF I SHOULD OFFER TO STIR
NEITHER DID ANY MAN MEET HIM WITH THE LEAST ENCOURAGEMENT
THAT IF HE WOULD LET ONE OF THE CREW BRING MY CLOSET INTO HIS CABIN I WOULD OPEN IT THERE BEFORE HIM AND SHOW HIM MY GOODS
HE ENDEAVOURED TO STRUGGLE TO THE SIDE OF THE SLOUGH BUT COULD NOT GET OUT BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN THAT WAS UPON HIS BACK
HE PROMISED THE FRIAR A LARGE REWARD FOR DOING THE ERRAND AND AS THEY PARTED AT THE POSTERN DOOR HE THRUST INTO CEDRIC'S RELUCTANT HAND A PIECE OF GOLD ADDING REMEMBER I WILL FLAY OFF THY COWL AND SKIN IF THOU FAILEST IN THY PURPOSE WHEN FRONT-DE-BOEUF REJOINED HIS FRIENDS AND FOUND OUT THE TRICK WHICH HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM AND THAT CEDRIC HAD ESCAPED HIS RAGE WAS UNBOUNDED AND IT WAS ONLY ON DE BRACY INTERCEDING FOR HIM THAT HE CONSENTED TO SPARE THE LIFE OF THE POOR JESTER
SO DID THE EMPRESS AND YOUNG PRINCES OF THE BLOOD
GO SAID HE FOLLOW THEM AND ACT AS YOU SEE THEM DO
AND WHITHER ARE YOU BOUND
AND LEARNING THAT SHE WAS LIKELY TO BE FOUND WITH A PARTY OF SKATERS ON A LAKE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HE PROCEEDED IN THAT DIRECTION
TWO ONLY OF FRONT-DE-BOEUF'S CAPTIVES WERE MISSING
THE BARON'S WONDERFUL DOG BY R
THUS MANY DAYS PASSED PLEASANTLY AWAY
FOR ANTONIO BOTH HURT HIS PRIDE AND INJURED HIS BUSINESS
THE NOTE HAD GIVEN HIM NO INTIMATION HOWEVER OF THE PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE CONVEYED IN THE CHAISE TO WOODBOURNE MERELY TELLING HIM THAT IT SHOULD BRING THE FOLK THAT SHOULD ASK IF IT WERE THERE IN GOD'S NAME
WHAT BUSINESS BRINGS YOU HERE AFTER THESE WORDS ALADDIN'S MOTHER PROSTRATED HERSELF A SECOND TIME AND WHEN SHE AROSE SAID MONARCH OF MONARCHS I BEG OF YOU TO PARDON THE BOLDNESS OF MY PETITION AND TO ASSURE ME OF YOUR PARDON AND FORGIVENESS WELL REPLIED THE SULTAN I WILL FORGIVE YOU BE IT WHAT IT MAY AND NO HURT SHALL COME TO YOU
WITH THIS ANSWER THE ENVOY RETURNED TO LILLIPUT AND THE MONARCH OF BLEFUSCU RELATED TO ME ALL THAT HAD PASSED
THEN ARIEL UPBRAIDED THEM WITH THEIR SINS AND VANISHED TOO
ON REACHING THE WOOD SHE PLUNGED INTO IT MOVING STILL RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION OF DERNCLEUGH
AND I PRESENTLY CONCLUDED THEN THAT IT MUST BE SOME MORE DANGEROUS CREATURE
DOWN THEREFORE AND BEG MERCY OF THE DUKE THUS WERE THE TABLES TURNED AND NO MERCY WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SHYLOCK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR ANTONIO
THIS GENEROSITY GAINED HIM THE LOVE AND BLESSINGS OF THE PEOPLE AND IT WAS COMMON FOR THEM TO SWEAR BY HIS HEAD
AT WHICH WHEN THOU KNOCKEST IT SHALL BE TOLD THEE WHAT THOU SHALT DO
I ALSO FOUND SOME RUM IN THE GREAT CABIN OF WHICH I TOOK A LARGE DRAM AND WHICH I HAD INDEED NEED ENOUGH OF TO SPIRIT ME FOR WHAT WAS BEFORE ME
AND THERE HE WOULD COME TO HER AND MARRY HER
COME TO MY PALACE AND YOU SHALL CHOOSE WHAT MAY ANSWER YOUR PURPOSE WHEN THE SULTAN RETURNED TO HIS PALACE HE ORDERED HIS JEWELS TO BE BROUGHT OUT AND THE JEWELLERS TOOK A GREAT QUANTITY PARTICULARLY THOSE ALADDIN HAD MADE HIM A PRESENT OF WHICH THEY SOON USED WITHOUT MAKING ANY GREAT ADVANCE IN THEIR WORK
BUT AS HE HAD TAKEN ME IN HIS ARMS I HELD FAST BY HIM OR I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN TO THE GROUND
AND WITHOUT INDULGING IN IDLE WORDS AGAINST THE SULTAN THE VIZIER OR HIS SON HE DETERMINED IF POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THE MARRIAGE
I PRESENTLY KNEW WHAT THEY MEANT AND WAS GLAD AT HEART TO RECEIVE THIS INTELLIGENCE
I'D RATHER HAVE A HANDFUL OR TWO OF GOOD DRIED PEAS SAID THE CLOWN
AND WHEN YOU HAVE DONE I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER PIECE OF GOLD AFTER BABA MUSTAPHA HAD FINISHED HIS TASK SHE BLINDFOLDED HIM AGAIN GAVE HIM THE THIRD PIECE OF GOLD AS SHE HAD PROMISED AND RECOMMENDING SECRECY TO HIM CARRIED HIM BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE FIRST BOUND HIS EYES PULLED OFF THE BANDAGE AND LET HIM GO HOME BUT WATCHED HIM THAT HE RETURNED TOWARD HIS STALL TILL HE WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT FOR FEAR HE SHOULD HAVE THE CURIOSITY TO RETURN AND DODGE HER
AND HAVING SAID FAREWELL THE TWO JEWS PARTED ISAAC TO SEEK OUT IVANHOE AND THE RABBI TO GO TO YORK TO LOOK FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE
THE WORLD IS STILL DECEIVED WITH ORNAMENT AND SO NO GAUDY GOLD OR SHINING SILVER FOR ME
THEY DROVE AWAY THE MULES WHO STRAYED THROUGH THE FOREST SO FAR THAT THEY WERE SOON OUT OF SIGHT AND WENT DIRECTLY WITH THEIR NAKED SABRES IN THEIR HANDS TO THE DOOR WHICH ON THEIR CAPTAIN PRONOUNCING THE PROPER WORDS IMMEDIATELY OPENED
AND SO I MADE SIGNS TO HIM AGAIN TO DO SO
UNDER THAT PALMER'S GOWN REPLIED THE JEW IS HIDDEN A KNIGHT'S CHAIN AND SPURS OF GOLD
SOMETIMES THE MINISTER HAS IT ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF
THE SHORT TIME I CONTINUED IN ENGLAND I MADE A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT BY SHOWING MY CATTLE TO MANY PERSONS OF QUALITY AND OTHERS
A PILGRIM AT LENGTH WHO SAT BY THE CHIMNEY TOOK COMPASSION UPON HIM AND RESIGNED HIS SEAT SAYING BRIEFLY OLD MAN MY GARMENTS ARE DRIED MY HUNGER IS APPEASED THOU ART BOTH WET AND FASTING AND SO SAYING HE PLACED SOME FOOD BEFORE THE JEW ON THE SMALL TABLE AT WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF SUPPED AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE OLD MAN'S THANKS WENT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL
HIS ONLY COMFORT NOW WAS IN HEARING OF THE SERIOUS LOSSES WHICH HAD BEFALLEN ANTONIO SOME OF WHOSE SHIPS WERE WRECKED
IN THAT VERY MOMENT THIS POOR WRETCH SEEING HIMSELF A LITTLE AT LIBERTY AND UNBOUND NATURE INSPIRED HIM WITH HOPES OF LIFE AND HE STARTED AWAY FROM THEM AND RAN WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS ALONG THE SANDS DIRECTLY TOWARDS ME
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER SUCH AN EASY MATTER TO MAKE THEIR EXIT FROM THE MANSION
NOW THIS WOOD WHERE LYSANDER WAS TO MEET HERMIA AND WHERE THE OTHER TWO HAD DECIDED TO FOLLOW THEM WAS FULL OF FAIRIES AS MOST WOODS ARE IF ONE ONLY HAD THE EYES TO SEE THEM AND IN THIS WOOD ON THIS NIGHT WERE THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES OBERON AND TITANIA
FOLLOW THINE OWN FATE AND LEAVE ME TO MINE AS SHE SPOKE SHE VANISHED THROUGH A PRIVATE DOOR AND FRONT-DE BOEUF ENTERED THE APARTMENT
THEN I KNEW THAT MY GOATS WANTED TO BE MILKED TOO WHICH USUALLY WAS MY EVENING DIVERSION AND THE POOR CREATURES WERE IN GREAT PAIN AND INCONVENIENCE FOR WANT OF IT
WHEN HE HAD SOLD THE LAST DISH HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE TRAY WHICH WEIGHED TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS THE DISHES AND WOULD HAVE CARRIED IT TO HIS OLD PURCHASER BUT THAT IT WAS TOO LARGE AND CUMBERSOME
THE OFFICER WHO IS BEFORE HIM ON THE SAME ELEPHANT CRIES FROM TIME TO TIME WITH A LOUD VOICE BEHOLD THE GREAT MONARCH THE POTENT AND REDOUBTABLE SULTAN OF THE INDIES THE MONARCH GREATER THAN SOLOMON AND THE POWERFUL MAHARAJA AFTER HE HAS PRONOUNCED THOSE WORDS THE OFFICER BEHIND THE THRONE CRIES IN HIS TURN THIS MONARCH SO GREAT AND SO POWERFUL MUST DIE MUST DIE MUST DIE AND THE OFFICER BEFORE REPLIES PRAISE ALONE BE TO HIM WHO LIVETH FOR EVER AND EVER THE CALIPH WAS MUCH PLEASED WITH MY ACCOUNT AND SENT ME HOME WITH A RICH PRESENT
I THEN ADVANCED FORWARD NEAR HALF A MILE BUT COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY SIGN OF HOUSES OR INHABITANTS
LITTLE MORE REMAINS TO BE TOLD
SO EVERY DAY AT LOW WATER I WENT ON BOARD AND BROUGHT AWAY SOMETHING OR OTHER
TAKE HER HE SAID SHE IS THINE OWN IN THE MEANTIME ANTONIO AND SEBASTIAN IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ISLAND WERE PLOTTING THE MURDER OF ALONSO THE KING OF NAPLES FOR FERDINAND BEING DEAD AS THEY THOUGHT SEBASTIAN WOULD SUCCEED TO THE THRONE ON ALONSO'S DEATH
HE SHALL NOT PRESUME TO COME INTO OUR METROPOLIS WITHOUT OUR EXPRESS ORDER
I CANNOT EXPRESS THE JOY IT AFFORDS ME
IT WAS RUMOURED TOO AMONGST THE COUNTRY-FOLK THAT GLOSSIN WAS THE MAN OF ALL OTHERS WHO WAS MOST EAGER TO TURN THE BERTRAMS OUT OF THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BUY THE PROPERTY HIMSELF AND BECOME THE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN
THESE HOOKS WERE TIED BY A LONG CORD TO THE HARNESS AND THUS MY HAT WAS DRAGGED ALONG FOR ABOVE HALF AN ENGLISH MILE
I LONGED TO SEE THE OCEAN WHICH MUST BE THE ONLY SCENE OF MY ESCAPE IF EVER IT SHOULD HAPPEN
AND AFTER MANY GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH TO AVOID THE CENSURE OF VANITY I SHALL NOT REPEAT HE ADDED THAT HE HOPED I SHOULD PROVE A USEFUL SERVANT AND WELL DESERVE ALL THE FAVORS HE HAD ALREADY CONFERRED UPON ME OR MIGHT DO FOR THE FUTURE
I TOOK OUT ONE OF THE FOWLING-PIECES AND ONE OF THE PISTOLS AND A HORN OF POWDER
SO I POINTED TO HIM AND SHOWED HIM THE SAVAGE THAT HE WAS NOT DEAD
JOY AND GLADNESS SUCCEEDED TO SORROW AND GRIEF
HIS FAILURE TO OPEN IT REMINDED HIM PAINFULLY THAT HE WAS NOW A PRISONER
THE SERPENT FAILED NOT TO COME AT THE USUAL HOUR AND WENT ROUND THE TREE SEEKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVOUR ME BUT WAS PREVENTED BY THE RAMPART I HAD MADE
SO I WENT TO WORK AND WITH A CARPENTER'S SAW I CUT A SPARE TOPMAST INTO THREE LENGTHS AND ADDED THEM TO MY RAFT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LABOR AND PAINS
SO THEY TOLD THE KING BUT HE WOULD NOT COME DOWN TO SEE HIM BUT COMMANDED THE TWO SHINING ONES THAT CONDUCTED CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL TO THE CITY TO GO OUT AND TAKE IGNORANCE AND BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND HAVE HIM AWAY
AFTER THIS IT COST ME A MONTH TO SHAPE IT AND DUB IT TO A PROPORTION AND TO SOMETHING LIKE THE BOTTOM OF A BOAT THAT IT MIGHT SWIM UPRIGHT AS IT OUGHT TO DO
I LEFT THEM MY FIRE-ARMS
WITH WHOM I CONTINUED THREE YEARS AND A HALF MAKING A VOYAGE OR TWO INTO THE LEVANT AND SOME OTHER PARTS
SO HE WENT HIS WAY AND I CAME MINE
WHEN REQUIRED TO GIVE SOME PROOF OF HIS RANK IN THE ARMY HE STATED THAT HIS LUGGAGE HAD BEEN STOLEN
AT WHICH THE CAPTAIN WAS ENRAGED AND THE ROBBER IN AS GREAT CONFUSION AS HIS PREDECESSOR
TAKE AND DO WITH THEM AS YOU PLEASE I TOOK OUT WHAT WAS MOST VALUABLE IN MY BALES AND PRESENTED THEM TO THE MAHARAJA WHO KNOWING MY MISFORTUNE ASKED ME HOW I CAME BY SUCH RARITIES
THE POOR GIRL WAS ALMOST DISTRACTED
COME LET ME BLIND YOUR EYES AT THE SAME PLACE
WHEN THIS WAS DONE I STUCK ALL THE GROUND WITHOUT MY WALL FOR A GREAT LENGTH EVERY WAY AS FULL WITH STAKES OR STICKS OF THE OSIER-LIKE WOOD WHICH I FOUND SO APT TO GROW AS THEY COULD WELL STAND
YES AND THEY PUT ME IN HOPE AND FEAR
DURING THE CONFUSION WHICH REIGNED AMONGST THE FOLLOWERS OF FRONT DE-BOEUF WHEN THE ATTACK HAD COMMENCED REBECCA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE OLD CRONE ULRICA WHO WAS IN CLOSE ATTENDANCE ON THE WOUNDED MAN WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CASTLE IN COMPANY WITH ISAAC OF YORK AND THE OTHER CAPTIVES
BUT FOR ME THAT WAS THUS ENTERED AND ESTABLISHED AND HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO GO ON AS I HAD BEGUN FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS MORE AND TO HAVE SENT FOR THE OTHER HUNDRED POUNDS FROM ENGLAND AND WHO IN THAT TIME AND WITH THAT LITTLE ADDITION COULD SCARCE HAVE FAILED OF BEING WORTH THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING AND THAT INCREASING TOO
AND WHEN HE RETURNED INTO THE HALL HE FOUND INSTEAD OF HIS OWN POOR RAIMENT A ROBE THE MAGNIFICENCE OF WHICH ASTONISHED HIM
AND HAVING SATISFIED OUR HUNGER WITH FRUIT WE MOUNTED IT ACCORDINGLY
ONE CREATURE ALONE HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TREAT WITH HARSHNESS
I ALSO SOUGHT TO HIDE MYSELFS BUT I COULD NOT FOR THE MAN THAT SAT UPON THE CLOUD STILL KEPT HIS EYE UPON ME
THE STACK I WAS REPOSING ON WAS THE LARGEST IN THE YARD CONTAINING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LOAD
BUT PASSING BY A GOLDSMITH'S SHOP THE GOLDSMITH PERCEIVING HIM CALLED TO HIM AND SAID MY LAD I IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SELL TO THE JEW WHOM I OFTEN SEE YOU VISIT
THIS WAS WHAT I WISHED FOR AND IMMEDIATELY LEAVING FRIDAY AND THE CAPTAIN'S MATE TO THEIR BUSINESS I TOOK THE REST WITH ME
WE IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE PALACE AND CAME TO THE SHORE WHERE WE MADE SOME RAFTS EACH LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY THREE MEN WITH SOME TIMBER THAT LAY ABOUT IN GREAT QUANTITIES
I RESOLVED TO WAIT TO SEE IF THEY DID NOT SEPARATE
FOR MY CONSCIENCE WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO IMITATE THE BAD PRACTICE OF TOO MANY AMONG MY BRETHREN
AND SO BY SWIMMING TO PRESERVE MY BREATHING AND PILOT MYSELF TOWARD THE SHORE IF POSSIBLE MY GREATEST CONCERN NOW BEING THAT THE WAVE AS IT WOULD CARRY ME A GREAT WAY TOWARD THE SHORE WHEN IT CAME ON MIGHT NOT CARRY ME BACK AGAIN WITH IT WHEN IT GAVE BACK TOWARD THE SEA
NOW THE MONSTER WAS HIDEOUS TO BEHOLD
THE CABLE WAS ABOUT AS THICK AS PACKTHREAD AND THE BARS OF THE LENGTH AND SIZE OF A KNITTING NEEDLE
IN BAGDAD AND CAIRO TO-DAY THAT CAFE NEVER LACKS CUSTOMERS WHERE THE BLIND STORYTELLER RELATES TO THE SPELL-BOUND ARABS SOME CHAPTER FROM THE IMMORTAL ARABIAN NIGHTS THE KING OF ALL WONDER BOOKS
BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT I HAD FELT WHICH PROBABLY MIGHT NOT BE THE WORST THEY COULD DO AND THE PROMISE OF HONOR I MADE THEM FOR SO I INTERPRETED MY SUBMISSIVE BEHAVIOR SOON DROVE OUT THESE IMAGINATIONS
BUT BEING PERSUADED THAT I WAS NOT ASLEEP I RECITED THE FOLLOWING WORDS IN ARABIC ALOUD
SIR WHAT THINK YOU
ON MY RETURN I ASKED FOR DIANA MY SETTER
AND COGIA HOUSSAIN SEEING THAT SHE WAS COMING TO HIM HAD PULLED HIS PURSE OUT OF HIS BOSOM TO MAKE HER A PRESENT
NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT DISOBEY HIS FATHER BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS AGREEABLE TO HIS INCLINATION
THE SHIP IN WHICH I SAILED WAS THE FIRST KNOWN TO BE DRIVEN WITHIN SIGHT OF THAT COAST AND THE KING HAD GIVEN STRICT ORDERS THAT IF AT ANY TIME ANOTHER APPEARED IT SHOULD BE TAKEN ASHORE AND WITH ALL ITS CREW AND PASSENGERS BROUGHT IN A TUMBREL TO LORBRULGRUD
WHERE AND IN WHAT CONDITION DID YOU LEAVE HIM I KNOW LITTLE OF THE KNIGHT OF IVANHOE ANSWERED THE PALMER WITH A TROUBLED VOICE
AND ABOUT FOUR YARDS FROM ME OVER AGAINST MY RIGHT EAR I HEARD A KNOCKING FOR ABOVE AN HOUR LIKE THAT OF PEOPLE AT WORK
I AM NOT FRIENDS WITH HIM NOW IT RESTS WITH YOU TO MAKE UP THE QUARREL SAID THE KING
THE TRUMPETS INSTANTLY SOUNDED WHILE THE HERALDS PROCLAIMED THE LADY ROWENA THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY AND OF LOVE FOR THE ENSUING DAY
THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONCLUDED BY BOTH HATTERAICK AND GLOSSIN BEING SENT TO GAOL
TO FINISH THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PLACE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR SHIPS TO GET OFF WHEN ONCE THEY APPROACH WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE
SO BASSANIO WAS FORGIVEN AND MADE HAPPIER THAN EVER TO KNOW HOW RICH A PRIZE HE HAD DRAWN IN THE LOTTERY OF THE CASKETS
THE KING OF SERENDIB WAS HIGHLY GRATIFIED AT THE CALIPH'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
AND SHORTLY AFTER BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT ENTERED THE APARTMENT
NOW I BEGAN SORELY TO REPENT THAT I HAD DUG MY CAVE SO LARGE AS TO BRING A DOOR THROUGH AGAIN WHICH DOOR AS I SAID CAME OUT BEYOND WHERE MY FORTIFICATION JOINED TO THE ROCK
THE TRUMPETS HAD NO SOONER GIVEN THE SIGNAL THAN THE COMBATANTS VANISHED FROM THEIR POSTS WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHTNING AND CLOSED IN THE CENTRE OF THE LISTS WITH THE SHOCK OF A THUNDERBOLT
BEAUMANOIR TORE OPEN THE SEAL AND PERUSED THE LETTER IN HASTE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE AND HORROR
I DISCOVERED NOTHING ALL THAT DAY
I TOOK THE KING OF SERENDIB'S LETTER AND WENT TO PRESENT MYSELF AT THE GATE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL AND WAS IMMEDIATELY CONDUCTED TO THE THRONE OF THE CALIPH
WHEREUPON SEVEN MONSTERS LIKE HIMSELF CAME TOWARD HIM WITH REAPING-HOOKS IN THEIR HANDS EACH HOOK ABOUT THE LARGENESS OF SIX SCYTHES
NONE KNOW BETTER HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIND WRITERS WITH A GOOD NARRATIVE STYLE THAN THOSE EDITORS WHOSE TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE HAVE MADE THEM REALIZE ITS VALUE AND IMPORTANCE
AT LAST HE RECOLLECTED ME HIMSELF AND EMBRACING ME HEAVEN BE PRAISED SAID HE FOR YOUR HAPPY ESCAPE
IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE DAY OF HER TRIAL IF IT COULD BE CALLED SUCH A LOW KNOCK WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR OF REBECCA'S PRISON CHAMBER
SHE WENT ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES IN THE SAME ORDER AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY
THEY NEEDED VERY FEW ARGUMENTS TO PERSUADE A SINGLE MAN TO YIELD WHEN HE SAW FIVE MEN UPON HIM AND HIS COMRADE KNOCKED DOWN
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING SO WHICH I LAUGH AT EVERY TIME I THINK OF IT THE OLD MAN WHO TO ME APPEARED QUITE DECREPIT THREW HIS LEGS NIMBLY ABOUT MY NECK
BUT WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK OF PUTTING IT IN PRACTICE I HAD SUCH TERROR UPON MY SPIRITS AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE DANGER I HAD BEEN IN THAT I COULD NOT THINK OF IT AGAIN WITH ANY PATIENCE BUT ON THE CONTRARY I TOOK UP ANOTHER RESOLUTION WHICH WAS MORE SAFE THOUGH MORE LABORIOUS AND THIS WAS THAT I WOULD BUILD OR RATHER MAKE ME ANOTHER PERIGAUA OR CANOE AND SO HAVE ONE FOR ONE SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND ONE FOR THE OTHER
NOR IS IT EVEN FOR THAT POOR OLD MAN
THIS ENTERTAINMENT LASTED TILL NIGHT WHEN ALADDIN WOULD HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS UNCLE TO GO HOME
ON THE MORNING FOLLOWING MANNERING STROLLED OUT TOWARDS THE OLD CASTLE THINKING TO HIMSELF WHETHER HE SHOULD TELL MR BERTRAM WHAT HE HAD LEARNED FROM THE STARS RESPECTING HIS YOUNG SON'S FUTURE LIFE
HE ROSE ACCORDINGLY IN HASTE
FOR AS FOR MYSELF I HAD RESOLVED TO QUIT THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MEN AND HAD TAKEN PASSAGE WITH THE CAPTAIN TO GO TO ENGLAND
EACH ONE REMAINED SILENT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY WHEN THE ABSENT-MINDED DOMINIE LOOKING UP FROM A BOOK HE HAD BEEN STUDYING IN A CORNER EXCLAIMED
WHEN THIS REPLY WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE PARTY OF THE BLACK KNIGHT A HURRIED CONSULTATION WAS HELD AS TO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO
UPON WHICH ALADDIN PENETRATING HIS THOUGHTS PULLED OUT HIS PURSE AND SHOWING HIM SOME GOLD ASKED FOR HALF A DRAM OF THE POWDER WHICH THE DRUGGIST WEIGHED AND GAVE HIM TELLING HIM THE PRICE WAS A PIECE OF GOLD
AND NOW THE MOST LABORIOUS PART BEING OVER I TOOK OUT MY OTHER CABLES WHICH WERE STOWED IN ONE OF THE SHIPS AND FASTENED THEM FIRST TO THE BOAT AND THEN TO NINE OF THE VESSELS WHICH ATTENDED ME
IN A WORD THE NATURE AND EXPERIENCE OF THINGS DICTATED TO ME UPON JUST REFLECTION THAT ALL THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD ARE NO FARTHER GOOD TO US THAN THEY ARE FOR OUR USE
HE CONDEMNED HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN BETTER PRECAUTION AND PREPARED TO RECEIVE THE STROKE FROM HIM WHO WAS APPOINTED TO CUT OFF HIS HEAD
I CONFESS THIS REFLECTION WAS OBVIOUS ENOUGH
SO THE SOUL OF THE PILGRIMS WAS MUCH DISCOURAGED BECAUSE OF THE WAY NOW A LITTLE BEFORE THEM THERE WAS ON THE LEFT HAND OF THE ROAD A MEADOW AND A STILE TO GO OVER INTO IT AND THAT MEADOW IS CALLED BY-PATH-MEADOW
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE COURT HE UNLOADED THE ASS AND TAKING MORGIANA ASIDE SAID TO HER
BUT WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU SO AFRAID OF THIS SIGHT
FOR I APPREHENDED EVERY MOMENT THAT HE WOULD DASH ME AGAINST THE GROUND AS WE USUALLY DO ANY LITTLE HATEFUL ANIMAL WHICH WE HAVE A MIND TO DESTROY
IN THE MEANTIME ISAAC OF YORK THOUGH SUFFERING MUCH FROM THE ILL-TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED AT TORQUILSTONE MADE HIS WAY TO THE PRECEPTORY OF TEMPLESTOWE FOR THE PURPOSE OF NEGOTIATING HIS DAUGHTER'S REDEMPTION
DID NOT I DIRECT THEE THE WAY TO THE LITTLE WICKET-GATE
AND ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD GLUMDALCLITCH AND I ATTENDED THE KING AND QUEEN IN A PROGRESS TO THE SOUTH COAST OF THE KINGDOM
BUT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR THAT FOR THERE WAS EXACTLY THE PRINT OF A FOOT TOES HEEL AND EVERY PART OF A FOOT
I OBSERVED IT HAD YET SOME LIFE BUT WITH A STRONG SLASH ACROSS THE NECK I THOROUGHLY DESPATCHED IT
IN THE EVENING MORGIANA WENT TO THE SAME DRUGGIST'S AGAIN AND WITH TEARS IN HER EYES ASKED FOR AN ESSENCE WHICH THEY USED TO GIVE TO SICK PEOPLE ONLY WHEN AT THE LAST EXTREMITY
BUT THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH MORGIANA'S GOOD QUALITIES COMMENDED HIS GENEROSITY AND GOODNESS OF HEART
I WAS EXTREMELY TIRED AND WITH THAT AND THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER AND ABOUT HALF A PINT OF BRANDY THAT I DRANK AS I LEFT THE SHIP I FOUND MYSELF MUCH INCLINED TO SLEEP
HE TOOK UP ALL THE REST ONE BY ONE AND VIEWED THEM IN THE SAME MANNER
THE CASTLE WAS MERELY A RUIN AT THIS TIME AND AS HE WANDERED AMIDST THE GLOOMY REMNANTS OF THE ANCIENT STRUCTURE HIS ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE VOICE OF THE GIPSY WHOM HE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
CHRISTIAN'S FIGHT WITH THE MONSTER APOLLYON BY JOHN BUNYAN IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION POOR CHRISTIAN WAS HARD PUT TO IT
COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I REPLIED I AM READY TO DO WHATEVER YOUR MAJESTY SHALL THINK FIT TO COMMAND
BUT LOOKING OVER THE LAND I BEHELD SOMETHING WHITE
RICHLY RICHLY WOULD I REQUITE THINE AID THINK NOT OF IT SAID THE HAG FROM HENCE THERE IS NO ESCAPE BUT THROUGH THE GATES OF DEATH
IN EACH OF THESE YOU WILL SEE FOUR LARGE BRASS CISTERNS PLACED ON EACH SIDE FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER
AND AS HE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE GLOWING FURNACE HIS RESOLUTION AT LENGTH GAVE WAY
AND THE DOOR DID NOT MOVE ON HINGES BUT UP AND DOWN LIKE A SASH WHICH KEPT MY CLOSET SO TIGHT THAT VERY LITTLE WATER CAME IN
BUT PARTICULARLY THE THIRD TIME I WENT I BROUGHT AWAY AS MUCH OF THE RIGGING AS I COULD AS ALSO ALL THE SMALL ROPES AND ROPE-TWINES I COULD GET WITH A PIECE OF SPARE CANVAS WHICH WAS TO MEND THE SAILS UPON OCCASION AND THE BARREL OF WET GUNPOWDER
HOWEVER THAT WE MIGHT BE VERY SECURE I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD GO BACK AGAIN AND CHOOSE OUT THOSE FIVE AND TELL THEM THAT THEY MIGHT SEE HE DID NOT WANT MEN THAT HE WOULD TAKE OUT THOSE FIVE TO BE HIS ASSISTANTS AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD KEEP THE OTHER TWO AND THE THREE THAT WERE SENT PRISONERS TO THE CASTLE MY CAVE AS HOSTAGES FOR THE FIDELITY OF THOSE FIVE
WHEREUPON THE MALICIOUS ROGUE WATCHING HIS OPPORTUNITY WHEN I WAS WALKING UNDER ONE OF THEM SHOOK IT DIRECTLY OVER MY HEAD BY WHICH A DOZEN APPLES EACH OF THEM NEAR AS LARGE AS A BRISTOL BARREL CAME TUMBLING ABOUT MY EARS
BERTRAM AND HIS FRIENDS HAD ADVANCED FAR ENOUGH TO ENABLE THEM TO STAND UPRIGHT AND CONCEALED FROM THE VIEW OF HATTERAICK THEY LISTENED TO HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE GIPSY
SO THAT UPON THE HONOR AND CONSCIENCE OF A GOOD SPORTSMAN I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FORMERLY OR WHETHER THERE ARE NOT SUCH CROSSED STAGS EVEN AT THIS PRESENT DAY
BUT THIS I HAD NO REMEDY FOR BUT PATIENCE ANY MORE THAN I HAD FOR THE PRODIGIOUS DEAL OF TIME AND LABOR WHICH IT TOOK ME UP TO MAKE A PLANK OR BOARD
THE MERCHANTS WHO LANDED WITH ME BROKE THE EGG WITH HATCHETS AND MADE A HOLE IN IT PULLED OUT THE YOUNG ROC PIECEMEAL AND ROASTED IT
SHE WAS IN AS GREAT AMAZEMENT AT WHAT HER SON TOLD HER AS AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE GENIE
THE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT DIAMONDS
ACCORDINGLY THEY BORE HER TO THE VAULT IN THE RUINED TOWER
THEN GOING DOWN ANOTHER STREET OR TWO HE WALKED TILL HE CAME TO ONE OF THE CITY GATES AND PURSUING HIS WAY THROUGH THE SUBURBS WHICH WERE VERY EXTENSIVE AT LENGTH REACHED A LONELY SPOT WHERE HE STOPPED TILL THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT AS THE MOST SUITABLE TIME FOR THE DESIGN HE HAD IN CONTEMPLATION
NEITHER DO I THINK THEY JUSTLY OUGHT TO BE BLAMED FOR WITHOUT QUESTION THE SIGHT WAS RIDICULOUS ENOUGH TO EVERYBODY BUT MYSELF
THE TIME MAY COME THAT MAY GIVE US A HAPPY RELEASE
THEREFORE WHEN I WAS COME TO YEARS I DID AS OTHER CONSIDERATE PERSONS DO LOOK OUT IF PERHAPS I MIGHT FIND SOMETHING BETTER
I ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR RECOVERY
IN THE MEANTIME THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS WENT INTO THE YARD TOOK OFF THE LID OF EACH JAR AND GAVE HIS PEOPLE ORDERS WHAT TO DO
LET US SET OFF WELL ARMED WITHOUT ITS APPEARING WHO WE ARE
BUT WAS PREVENTED BY HIS SITTING THERE AFTER SUPPER TO TAKE A LITTLE FRESH AIR
WHEN HE CAME HOME HIS WIFE SAID TO HIM CASSIM I KNOW YOU THINK YOURSELF RICH BUT ALI BABA IS INFINITELY RICHER THAN YOU
AND THEY WOULD HAVE CARRIED OUT THEIR WICKED PURPOSE WHILE THEIR VICTIM WAS ASLEEP BUT THAT ARIEL WOKE HIM IN GOOD TIME
AT THIS I APPEARED VERY ANGRY EXPRESSED MY ABHORRENCE OF IT MADE AS IF I WOULD VOMIT AT THE THOUGHTS OF IT AND BECKONED WITH MY HAND TO HIM TO COME AWAY WHICH HE DID IMMEDIATELY WITH GREAT SUBMISSION
THIS WAS NO LONGER MATTER OF SO MUCH DIFFICULTY AS FORMERLY
ONE DAY WE WERE OVERTAKEN BY A DREADFUL TEMPEST WHICH DROVE US FROM OUR COURSE
AFTER MUTUAL CONGRATULATIONS WE MEASURED THE CROCODILE WHICH WAS JUST FORTY FEET IN LENGTH
FOR THE MAHARAJA'S CAPITAL IS SITUATED ON THE SEA-COAST AND HAS A FINE HARBOR WHERE SHIPS ARRIVE DAILY FROM THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS OF THE WORLD
SO WHEN HE AROSE HE GETTETH HIM A GRIEVOUS CRAB-TREE CUDGEL AND GOES DOWN INTO THE DUNGEON TO THEM AND THERE FIRST FALLS TO RATING OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE DOGS ALTHOUGH THEY GAVE HIM NEVER A WORD OF DISTASTE
4TH
2NDLY THE TIDE RISING AND SETTING IN TO THE SHORE
WHEN THE REPAST WAS OVER SINDBAD ADDRESSED HIS CONVERSATION TO HINDBAD AND INQUIRED HIS NAME AND EMPLOYMENT AND SAID
COURT'SIED WHEN YOU HAVE AND KISS'D THE WILD WAVES WHIST FOOT IT FEATLY HERE AND THERE
SHORTLY AFTER THIS THE IMAUN AND THE OTHER MINISTERS OF THE MOSQUE ARRIVED
IS IT NOT WORTHY OF THE PRINCESS MY DAUGHTER
THE OTHER MERCHANTS WHO TRADED IN IT DID THE SAME FOR MY MASTER MADE THEM PARTAKERS OF HIS GOOD-FORTUNE
WHEN BERTRAM APPROACHED THE WRETCHED BED ON WHICH SHE LAY SHE TOOK HIS HAND
I WALKED WITH INTREPIDITY FIVE OR SIX TIMES BEFORE THE VERY HEAD OF THE CAT AND CAME WITHIN HALF A YARD OF HER
HE LED THEM THROUGH THE STREETS TILL HE CAME TO ALI BABA'S AT WHOSE DOOR HE DESIGNED TO HAVE KNOCKED
AS FOR THE CREATURE I KILLED I TOOK IT TO BE A KIND OF HAWK ITS COLOR AND BEAK RESEMBLING IT BUT IT HAD NO TALONS OR CLAWS MORE THAN COMMON
WHEN I HAD ALL THINGS COMPLETED I PRESENTED THEM TO THE KING AND PUT THEM UPON ONE OF HIS HORSES
BUT AN HONEST LAD ONE OF MY NURSE'S FOOTMEN CLIMBED UP AND PUTTING ME INTO HIS BREECHES POCKET BROUGHT ME DOWN--SAFE
THAT'S NOT LIKE SAID THE OTHER
WHEN I TOOK LEAVE OF THIS ISLAND I CARRIED ON BOARD FOR RELICS THE GREAT GOAT-SKIN CAP I HAD MADE MY UMBRELLA AND ONE OF MY PARROTS
THE THIEF BEFORE HE PULLED OFF THE BAND MARKED THE DOOR WITH A PIECE OF CHALK WHICH HE HAD READY IN HIS HAND AND THEN ASKED HIM IF HE KNEW WHOSE HOUSE THAT WAS
WAS THERE EVER YET ANYTHING WRITTEN BY MERE MAN SAID DR SAMUEL JOHNSON THAT WAS WISHED LONGER BY ITS READERS EXCEPTING ROBINSON CRUSOE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS AND DON QUIXOTE AT THIS TIME WHEN THE SUBJECT OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING IS RECEIVING SO MUCH ATTENTION AND PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTION IS BEING CRITICIZED BECAUSE ITS CRITICS SAY IT DOES NOT PREPARE BOYS AND GIRLS TO MEET THE DEMANDS WHICH LIFE MAKES UPON THEM IT IS INTERESTING TO READ WHAT WAS SAID ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO BY A MAN WHOSE INFLUENCE ON EDUCATION HAS BEEN BOTH DEEP AND LASTING IN CHARACTER
PRINCESS SAID HE WHATEVER RESOLUTION A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN AS I AM MAY HAVE MADE TO RENOUNCE THE POMP AND GRANDEUR OF THIS WORLD I DARE NOT PRESUME TO OPPOSE THE WILL AND COMMANDS OF SO PIOUS AND CHARITABLE A PRINCESS UPON THIS THE PRINCESS RISING UP SAID COME WITH ME
HERE THEY LEFT THEM BOUND BUT GAVE THEM PROVISIONS AND PROMISED THEM IF THEY CONTINUED THERE QUIETLY TO GIVE THEM THEIR LIBERTY IN A DAY OR TWO
THE SLAVE RETURNED LAUGHING SO HEARTILY THAT THE PRINCESS REBUKED HER
THEN SAID THE GIANT YOU HAVE THIS NIGHT TRESPASSED ON ME BY TRAMPLING IN AND LYING ON MY GROUNDS AND THEREFORE YOU MUST GO ALONG WITH ME
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE ISAAC OF YORK FOR IT WAS HE COULD EXPLAIN THE NATURE OF HIS TROUBLE
WHEREIN ALTHOUGH I BELIEVED HIM SINCERE YET I RESOLVED NEVER MORE TO PUT ANY CONFIDENCE IN PRINCES OR MINISTERS WHERE I COULD POSSIBLY AVOID IT AND THEREFORE WITH ALL DUE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR HIS FAVORABLE INTENTIONS I HUMBLY BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED
SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT THE SULTAN HIMSELF CAME IN AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HER WHOM HE KNEW AS HIS SUPPLIANT AT HIS DIVAN IN SUCH HUMBLE GUISE TO BE NOW MORE RICHLY AND SUMPTUOUSLY ATTIRED THAN HIS OWN DAUGHTER
I THEN LED HIM UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL TO SEE IF HIS ENEMIES WERE GONE
I PUT MY EAR TO THE GROUND AND NOT ONLY HEARD THE GROANS DISTINCTLY RISING FROM BENEATH BUT MY WIFE'S VOICE AND THOSE OF MY LIEUTENANT AND SERVANT
THAT AS SOON AS EVER THEY HEARD THE SEAMEN ANSWER THEM THEY SHOULD RETURN IT AGAIN
LORD BROUGHAM RELATES THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS A PROFESSOR IN A UNIVERSITY CONSULTED ONE OF THE ABLEST HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME AS TO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST DISCIPLINE FOR ACQUIRING A GOOD NARRATIVE STYLE AS A PRELUDE TO WRITING A BOOK OF TRAVELS THROUGH ASIA
I TIED MYSELF STRONGLY TO IT WITH MY TURBAN IN HOPES THAT THE ROC NEXT MORNING WOULD CARRY ME WITH HER OUT OF THIS DESERT ISLAND
I WILL NEVER WEAR JEWELS MORE
WHICH AS BEFORE OBSERVED WAS WIDE OPEN
AT LAST FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAVE IT UP WITH MY LITTLE STRENGTH I FELL TO DIGGING AWAY THE SAND TO UNDERMINE IT AND SO TO MAKE IT FALL DOWN SETTING PIECES OF WOOD TO THRUST AND GUIDE IT RIGHT IN THE FALL
AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL MORNING THAT THEY LEFT THE BUILDING
FOR I DID NOT NOW TAKE DUE WAYS TO COMPOSE MY MIND BY CRYING TO GOD IN MY DISTRESS AND RESTING UPON HIS PROVIDENCE AS I HAD DONE BEFORE FOR MY DEFENCE AND DELIVERANCE
I KNOCKED PIECES INTO THE WALL OF THE ROCK TO HANG MY GUNS AND ALL THINGS THAT WOULD HANG UP
I JUMPED OFF MY HORSE
I THEREFORE BOUGHT GOODS DEPARTED WITH THEM FOR THE BEST SEAPORT
SO THAT IF HE COULD BUT HOLD OUT FOR HALF AN HOUR I SAW EASILY HE WOULD FAIRLY GET AWAY FROM THEM ALL
HOW THEN CAN I GO BACK FROM THIS AND NOT BE HANGED AS A TRAITOR
IN THAT PLACE YOU MUST WEAR CROWNS OF GOLD AND ENJOY THE PERPETUAL SIGHT AND VISION OF THE HOLY ONE FOR THERE YOU SHALL SEE HIM AS HE IS
WHICH FELL OUT JUST AS WE DESIRED FOR INDEED IT WAS EASY TO THINK AS THEIR CONDITION THEN WAS THEY WOULD BE VERY WILLING TO CAPITULATE
WHEN I HAD GONE THROUGH THIS WORK I WAS EXTREMELY DELIGHTED WITH IT
I ARRIVED AT THE FLEET IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR
I WANTED TO BE AMONG PEOPLE WITH WHOM I COULD CONVERSE UPON EVEN TERMS AND WALK ABOUT THE STREETS AND FIELDS WITHOUT BEING AFRAID OF BEING TROD TO DEATH LIKE A FROG OR A YOUNG PUPPY
COME NEPHEW SAID HE YOU MUST BE WEARY AS WELL AS I
THE VERY NIGHT HE STARTED THE MONEY-LENDER'S PRETTY DAUGHTER JESSICA RAN AWAY FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH HER LOVER AND SHE TOOK WITH HER FROM HER FATHER'S HOARDS SOME BAGS OF DUCATS AND PRECIOUS STONES
IT SEEMS THEY HAD SUCH DREADFUL APPREHENSION OF THE DANGER OF THE PLACE THAT THEY RESOLVED TO GO ON BOARD THE SHIP AGAIN GIVE THEIR COMPANIONS OVER FOR LOST AND SO GO ON WITH THEIR INTENDED VOYAGE WITH THE SHIP
AND WHAT THEY DID IN HIS GROUNDS
IN THE MEANTIME I HERE CONCLUDE THE SECOND PART OF MY UNFORTUNATE VOYAGES
HE SPOKE OFTEN TO ME BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE PIERCED MY EARS LIKE THAT OF A WATERMILL YET HIS WORDS WERE ARTICULATE ENOUGH
HOWEVER I MADE ME A TABLE AND A CHAIR AS I OBSERVED ABOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE
I AM SORRY I HAVE HEARKENED TO THIS MAN'S COUNSEL
COLONEL MANNERING HAD HOWEVER NO IDEA THAT BROWN WAS STILL ALIVE AND THE DAUGHTER WAS AFRAID TO TELL HER FATHER THAT HE WAS
WHEN I CAME DOWN FROM MY APARTMENT IN THE TREE I LOOKED ABOUT ME AGAIN AND THE FIRST THING I FOUND WAS THE BOAT WHICH LAY AS THE WIND AND THE SEA HAD TOSSED HER UP UPON THE LAND ABOUT TWO MILES ON MY RIGHT HAND
BUT THE GREATEST DANGER I UNDERWENT IN THAT KINGDOM WAS FROM A MONKEY WHO BELONGED TO ONE OF THE CLERKS OF THE KITCHEN
MY SINS ALSO CAME INTO MY MIND
HAVING FILLED THE CALABASH I PUT IT BY IN A CONVENIENT PLACE AND GOING THITHER AGAIN SOME DAYS AFTER I TASTED IT AND FOUND THE WINE SO GOOD THAT IT GAVE ME NEW VIGOR AND SO EXHILARATED MY SPIRITS THAT I BEGAN TO SING AND DANCE AS I CARRIED MY BURDEN
AND NOW OUR CASE WAS VERY DISMAL INDEED
THE INTERPRETER ANSWERED THIS FIRE IS THE WORK OF GRACE THAT IS WROUGHT IN THE HEART
WHEN THE WORKMEN FOUND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BREAK LOOSE THEY CUT ALL THE STRINGS THAT BOUND ME
I DID VERY MUCH WONDER IN ALL THIS TIME NOT TO HAVE HEARD OF ANY EXPRESS RELATING TO ME FROM OUR EMPEROR TO THE COURT OF BLEFUSCU
ROBINSON CRUSOE RESCUED BY DANIEL DEFOE AFTER HAVING BEEN ON HIS ISLAND FOR TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS AN ENGLISH VESSEL AT LAST ARRIVES
THEY CONVEYED THEM TO THE CAVE AS TO A PRISON
THE LAIRD HAD BEEN ALWAYS A BAD MAN OF BUSINESS AND AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE GOT INTO THE HANDS OF A SCHEMING AND DISHONEST ATTORNEY NAMED GLOSSIN WHO IN THE END CRAFTILY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HIMSELF RICH AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS EMPLOYER
EXACTLY AT ONE O'CLOCK THESE CANNON WERE ALL DISCHARGED IN MEMORY OF THE DAY THEY HAD BEEN ALL CHARGED THAT MORNING AND HAVING NO SUSPICION OF MY SITUATION I WAS SHOT OVER THE HOUSES ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER INTO A FARMER'S YARD BETWEEN BERMONDSEY AND DEPTFORD WHERE I FELL UPON A LARGE HAYSTACK WITHOUT WAKING AND CONTINUED THERE IN A SOUND SLEEP TILL HAY BECAME SO EXTRAVAGANTLY DEAR WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER THAT THE FARMER FOUND IT TO HIS INTEREST TO SEND HIS WHOLE STOCK TO MARKET
WHEN I FALL I SHALL ARISE AND WITH THAT GAVE HIM A DEADLY THRUST WHICH MADE HIM GIVE BACK AS ONE THAT HAD RECEIVED HIS MORTAL WOUND
BUT LET'S EXERCISE A LITTLE MORE PATIENCE REMEMBER HOW THOU PLAYEDST THE MAN AT VANITY FAIR AND WAST NEITHER AFRAID OF THE CHAIN NOR CAGE NOR YET OF BLOODY DEATH
WHAT WONDERFUL BOOK IS THIS
HE ACCORDINGLY ENTRUSTED IT TO THE LANDLADY OF THE INN FOR SAFE KEEPING
BUT NO ONE COULD SAY WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS CREW
EXCEPT THE BIBLE AND POSSIBLY SHAKESPEARE PROBABLY NO OTHER BOOK IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN READ BY MORE PEOPLE
GLOSSIN WHO WAS MUCH TERRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING DISCOVERED THEN ARRANGED LIKE A VILLAIN THAT HE WAS TO IMPRISON HATTERAICK FOR THAT NIGHT IN A ROOM IN THE OLD CASTLE OF ELLANGOWAN AND AT THE SAME TIME GIVE HIM A SMALL FILE WITH WHICH HE MIGHT RID HIMSELF OF HIS HANDCUFFS AND ESCAPE
THIS CHAMPION EXPOSED AS HE WAS TO THE FURIOUS ASSAULTS OF THREE OPPONENTS EACH OF WHOM WAS ALMOST A MATCH FOR HIM SINGLE-HANDED MUST NOW HAVE SOON BEEN OVERPOWERED WHEN AN UNEXPECTED INCIDENT CHANGED THE FORTUNES OF THE DAY
THE LONELINESS OF THE GLOOMY CAVERN BECAME FRIGHTFUL TO HIM
NOW OVER THE GATE THERE WAS WRITTEN KNOCK AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU HE KNOCKED THEREFORE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE AND AT LAST THERE CAME A GRAVE PERSON TO THE GATE NAMED GOOD-WILL WHO ASKED WHO WAS THERE
WE STOPPED AT SOME ISLANDS TO TAKE IN FRESH PROVISIONS
I MUST SEE THAT LAD AGAIN THE TRAVELLER HAD GONE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ACROSS THE LONELY MOORLAND THROUGH WHICH HIS ROAD LAY WHEN HIS LITTLE DOG WASP BEGAN TO BARK FURIOUSLY AT SOMETHING IN FRONT OF THEM
AND SUCH A BOAT AS I COULD MANAGE WOULD NEVER LIVE IN ONE OF THEIR RIVERS
THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT SO WELL CLAD AS THE FIRST WHOSE SERVANTS OR LABORERS THEY SEEMED TO BE
SHE ASSUMED A LOOK OF PLEASURE ON THE NEXT VISIT OF THE MAGICIAN AND ASKED HIM TO AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE MOST WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
I RELATED TO HIM MY ADVENTURE AFTER WHICH TAKING ME BY THE HAND HE LED ME INTO A CAVE WHERE THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE NO LESS AMAZED TO SEE ME THAN I WAS TO SEE THEM
GOOD-WILL
GOOD-WILL
GOOD-WILL
GOOD-WILL
AND THE REPORT DID BUT ENRAGE HIM FOR HE NOW QUICKENED HIS PACE AND SEEMED TO APPROACH ME FULL SPEED
NOW FAIRIES ARE VERY WISE PEOPLE BUT NOW AND THEN THEY CAN BE QUITE AS FOOLISH AS MORTAL FOLK
THE BOLTS WERE WITHDRAWN THE HINGES CREAKED AS THE WICKET OPENED AND REGINALD FRONT-DE-BOEUF FOLLOWED BY TWO SARACEN SLAVES OF THE TEMPLAR ENTERED THE PRISON
THEN I THOUGHT THAT IT IS EASIER GOING OUT OF THE WAY WHEN WE ARE IN THAN GOING IN WHEN WE ARE OUT YET THEY ADVENTURED TO GO BACK
THESE THOUGHTS TOOK ME UP MANY HOURS DAYS NAY I MAY SAY WEEKS AND MONTHS
WE SET IN THE LEE BRACES AND HAULED FORWARD BY THE WEATHER-BOWLINGS AND HAULED THEM TIGHT AND BELAYED THEM AND HAULED OVER THE MIZZEN TACK TO WINDWARD AND KEPT HER FULL AND BY AS NEAR AS SHE WOULD LIE
WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THE BATHS HE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE OIL JARS AND THAT THE MERCHANT WAS NOT GONE WITH THE MULES
HE FANCIED AT FIRST THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN AND EXAMINED THE TWO WINDOWS ON EACH SIDE AND AFTERWARD ALL THE FOUR AND TWENTY
THE TEMPEST RETOLD BY E
THY PENITENTS FATHER HE SAID HAVE MADE A LONG SHRIFT
I SHOULD LIKE SOME GOOD DRY OATS SAID THE CLOWN-FOR HIS DONKEY'S HEAD MADE HIM DESIRE DONKEY'S FOOD--"AND SOME HAY TO FOLLOW SHALL SOME OF MY FAIRIES FETCH YOU NEW NUTS FROM THE SQUIRREL'S HOUSE ASKED THE QUEEN
HAVING LADEN OUR VESSEL WITH COCOANUTS WE SET SAIL AND PASSED BY THE ISLANDS WHERE PEPPER GROWS IN GREAT PLENTY
NEITHER DID I SEE ANY PROSPECT BEFORE ME BUT THAT OF PERISHING WITH HUNGER OR BEING DEVOURED BY WILD BEASTS
CEDRIC STARTED BACK IN AMAZEMENT
ANOTHER TIME ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO FILL MY TROUGH EVERY THIRD DAY WITH FRESH WATER WAS SO CARELESS TO LET A HUGE FROG NOT PERCEIVING IT SLIP OUT OF HIS PAIL
BUT A LITTLE EASING THEM WHERE HE COMPLAINED THEY HURT HIM AND USING HIMSELF TO THEM HE TOOK TO THEM AT LENGTH VERY WELL
COME WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU FAIRIES TO ATTEND ON YOU SO SHE CALLED FOUR FAIRIES WHOSE NAMES WERE PEASEBLOSSOM COBWEB MOTH AND MUSTARDSEED
SO THAT AS WE NEVER SUFFERED THEM TO SEE ME AS GOVERNOR I NOW APPEARED AS ANOTHER PERSON AND SPOKE OF THE GOVERNOR THE GARRISON THE CASTLE AND THE LIKE UPON ALL OCCASIONS
I TOLD HIM IT WAS WHAT I HAD BEEN USED TO FOR ABOVE TWO YEARS PAST AND THAT I ADMIRED AS MUCH AT THE VOICES OF HIM AND HIS MEN WHO SEEMED TO ME ONLY TO WHISPER AND YET I COULD HEAR THEM WELL ENOUGH
HIS SON DESERTED AND DECEIVED HIM AS ROBINSON CRUSOE DESERTED AND DECEIVED HIS FATHER AND IT ALMOST BROKE THE OLD MAN'S HEART
WE HAD ANOTHER BOAT ON BOARD
IN THIS COMBAT NO MAN CAN IMAGINE UNLESS HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD AS I DID WHAT YELLING AND HIDEOUS ROARING APOLLYON MADE ALL THE TIME OF THE FIGHT HE SPAKE LIKE A DRAGON
WHAT OUR COUNTRY WILL AFFORD I DO HERE PROMISE TO GIVE THEE
I TOOK THE ROUTE OF PERSIA TRAVELLED OVER SEVERAL PROVINCES AND THEN ARRIVED AT A PORT WHERE I EMBARKED
THOUGH ALADDIN AND HIS MOTHER HAD AN INEXHAUSTIBLE TREASURE IN THEIR LAMP AND MIGHT HAVE HAD WHATEVER THEY WISHED FOR YET THEY LIVED WITH THE SAME FRUGALITY AS BEFORE AND IT MAY EASILY BE SUPPOSED THAT THE MONEY FOR WHICH ALADDIN HAD SOLD THE DISHES AND TRAY WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN THEM SOME TIME
I LAMENTED MY OWN FOLLY AND WILFULNESS IN ATTEMPTING A SECOND VOYAGE AGAINST THE ADVICE OF ALL MY FRIENDS AND RELATIONS
THE NEXT DAY I MADE ANOTHER VOYAGE AND NOW HAVING PLUNDERED THE SHIP OF WHAT WAS PORTABLE AND FIT TO HAND OUT I BEGAN WITH THE CABLES
I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM PRINCE JOHN TURNED PALE TOTTERED AND CAUGHT AT THE BACK OF AN OAKEN BENCH TO SUPPORT HIMSELF
OBERON TOOK OFF THE ASS'S HEAD FROM THE CLOWN AND LEFT HIM TO FINISH HIS SLEEP WITH HIS OWN SILLY HEAD LYING ON THE THYME AND VIOLETS
THAT SHE LAY NOW IN THE ROAD
AND WHAT GRIEVES ME MOST IS THAT I HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF IT
THAT EITHER THERE WERE INHABITANTS IN IT AND THEY SHOULD ALL BE MURDERED OR ELSE THERE WERE DEVILS AND SPIRITS IN IT AND THEY SHOULD BE ALL CARRIED AWAY AND DEVOURED
SPEAK BOLDLY WHEN ALADDIN'S MOTHER HAD TAKEN ALL THESE PRECAUTIONS FOR FEAR OF THE SULTAN'S ANGER SHE TOLD HIM FAITHFULLY THE ERRAND ON WHICH HER SON HAD SENT HER AND THE EVENT WHICH LED TO HIS MAKING SO BOLD A REQUEST IN SPITE OF ALL HER REMONSTRANCES
LET US SEE THE CAUSE OF THIS CURSED CLAMOUR SAID FRONT-DE BOEUF
I PREPARED FOR MY DEPARTURE IN A FEW DAYS
NEAR THESE HE AND THE SLAVE ABDALLA DUG A TRENCH LONG AND WIDE ENOUGH TO HOLD THE BODIES OF THE ROBBERS
HE ENTERTAINED ME WITH GREAT KINDNESS OBSERVING ME NOT TO LOOK WILDLY OR TALK INCONSISTENTLY
BUT WHY DID HE NOT COME THROUGH
THE MARSHAL OF THE FIELD NOW APPROACHED THE VICTOR PRAYING HIM TO SUFFER HIS HELMET TO BE UNLACED ERE THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO RECEIVE THE PRIZE OF THE DAY'S TOURNEY FROM THE HANDS OF PRINCE JOHN
PASSION SEEMED TO BE MUCH DISCONTENT
AND HE WAS THE APTEST SCHOLAR THAT EVER WAS
NESBIT PROSPERO THE DUKE OF MILAN WAS A LEARNED AND STUDIOUS MAN WHO LIVED AMONG HIS BOOKS LEAVING THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS DUKEDOM TO HIS BROTHER ANTONIO IN WHOM INDEED HE HAD COMPLETE TRUST
I PUT MY COWS AND SHEEP INTO MY COAT-POCKETS AND GOT ON BOARD WITH ALL MY LITTLE CARGO OF PROVISIONS
THE VILLAGE OF KIPPLETRINGAN WAS SITUATED A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE SEA
THE DUKE GAVE HER WELCOME ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT BELLARIO'S INTRODUCTION AND LEFT THE SETTLEMENT OF THE CASE TO HER
FOR INDEED AT FIRST I WAS IN TOO MUCH HURRY AND NOT ONLY HURRY AS TO LABOR BUT IN TOO MUCH DISCOMPOSURE OF MIND
BUT WHEN THEY PERCEIVED THE WHOLE FLEET MOVING IN ORDER AND SAW ME PULLING AT THE END THEY SET UP SUCH A SCREAM OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE OR CONCEIVE
TO WHICH THE COURT IMPATIENT TO HAVE ME GONE VERY READILY CONTRIBUTED
ALADDIN HAVING THUS LOADED HIMSELF WITH RICHES OF WHICH HE KNEW NOT THE VALUE RETURNED THROUGH THE THREE HALLS WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION AND SOON ARRIVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WHERE THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN AWAITED HIM WITH THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE
I SHALL NOT TROUBLE THE READER WITH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THIS VOYAGE WHICH WAS VERY PROSPEROUS FOR THE MOST PART
PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT SMITH COLLEGE NORTHAMPTON MASS SINCE 1917 VOLUME FIVE STORIES THAT NEVER GROW OLD ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF PERMISSIONS GIVEN BY AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS FOR THE USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL APPEAR IN VOLUME 10
PRAY TELL US YOUR HISTORY
SHE PLACED HERSELF JUST BEFORE THE SULTAN GRAND VIZIER AND THE GREAT LORDS WHO SAT IN COUNCIL ON HIS RIGHT AND LEFT HAND
JEALOUS OBERON ANSWERED THE QUEEN
HE HERE FELL IN WITH A FARMER NAMED DANDIE DINMONT A BIG ROLLICKING FELLOW WITH AN HONEST FACE AND KINDLY WAYS WITH WHOM HE BECAME FRIENDS IN A VERY LITTLE TIME
HOWEVER I DESIRED GLUMDALCLITCH TO LET ME DEAL WITH IT ALONE
HIS ART HAD ALSO TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE IT HIMSELF BUT MUST RECEIVE IT AS A VOLUNTARY GIFT FROM THE HANDS OF ANOTHER PERSON
THEIR GRAVE WALK AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER
BUT MY GOOD LUCK BEGAN NOW TO LEAVE ME
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN IS THERE NO HOPE BUT YOU MUST BE KEPT IN THE IRON CAGE OF DESPAIR
AND I GAVE HIM A CAP WHICH I MADE OF HARE'S SKIN VERY CONVENIENT AND FASHIONABLE ENOUGH
I HAVE GIVEN HIM MY FAITH AND SWORN MY ALLEGIANCE TO HIM
AND THEY SUPPLIED US WITH RICE TO FATTEN US
HIS MAJESTY MOUNTED IMMEDIATELY AND WAS SO PLEASED WITH THEM THAT HE TESTIFIED HIS SATISFACTION BY LARGE PRESENTS
HENCE HE SUSPECTED THAT HIS PLOT TO MURDER ALI BABA AND PLUNDER HIS HOUSE WAS DISCOVERED
I THUS GRADUALLY COLLECTED AS MANY COCOANUTS AS PRODUCED ME A CONSIDERABLE SUM
BUT AS TO MY CARGO IT WAS A GREAT PART OF IT LOST ESPECIALLY THE IRON WHICH I EXPECTED WOULD HAVE BEEN OF GREAT USE TO ME
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE AND WHETHER A DELIVERANCE WERE NOT WORTH VENTURING FOR
I ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE BUT THAT ONLY ADDED IF AN ADDITION COULD BE MADE TO MY DISTRESS
AND WERE VERY UNEASY WHEN AFTER LONG CONSULTATION WE SAW THEM ALL START UP AND MARCH DOWN TOWARDS THE SEA
I THEN ASKED THE CAPTAIN HOW FAR HE RECKONED WE MIGHT BE FROM LAND
THEN SAID THE INTERPRETER THE COMFORTER BE ALWAYS WITH THEE GOOD CHRISTIAN TO GUIDE THEE IN THE WAY THAT LEADS TO THE CITY
HE RECEIVED ONE LETTER WHICH DISPLEASED HIM VERY MUCH FROM A GREAT FRIEND OF HIS WHO WAS LIVING IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND MR MERVYN BY NAME IN WHOSE CARE HE HAD LEFT HIS DAUGHTER JULIA MANNERING WHEN HE WAS STARTING FOR KIPPLETRINGAN
THE OTHER ANSWERED AY AY
FOR THE CARRIAGE BEING STOPPED A WHILE TO ADJUST SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER TWO OR THREE OF THE YOUNG NATIVES HAD THE CURIOSITY TO SEE HOW I LOOKED WHEN I WAS ASLEEP
SOMETIMES THE EMPEROR HOLDS ONE END OF THE STICK AND HIS FIRST MINISTER THE OTHER
HIS END WAS ANSWERED
IN THE MIDST OF DINNER MY MISTRESS'S FAVORITE CAT LEAPED INTO HER LAP I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND ME LIKE THAT OF A DOZEN STOCKING WEAVERS AT WORK
I ANSWERED IN A FEW WORDS BUT IN THE MOST SUBMISSIVE MANNER LIFTING UP MY LEFT HAND AND BOTH MY EYES TO THE SUN AS CALLING HIM FOR A WITNESS
I TOLD HIM THAT SINCE FORTUNE WHETHER GOOD OR EVIL HAD THROWN A VESSEL IN MY WAY I WAS RESOLVED TO VENTURE MYSELF ON THE OCEAN RATHER THAN BE AN OCCASION OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO SUCH MIGHTY MONARCHS
WE CAME TO A THICK FOREST OF COCOA TREES VERY LOFTY WITH TRUNKS SO SMOOTH THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CLIMB TO THE BRANCHES THAT BORE THE FRUIT
ALADDIN WHO KNEW THAT ALL THE SULTAN'S ENDEAVORS TO MAKE THIS WINDOW LIKE THE REST WERE IN VAIN SENT FOR THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS AND NOT ONLY COMMANDED THEM TO DESIST FROM THEIR WORK BUT ORDERED THEM TO UNDO WHAT THEY HAD BEGUN AND TO CARRY ALL THEIR JEWELS BACK TO THE SULTAN AND TO THE VIZIER
HAD THEY THOUGHT FIT TO HAVE GONE TO SLEEP THERE AS THE OTHER PART OF THEM HAD DONE THEY HAD DONE THE JOB FOR US
AND THEN RESUMED HER SONG
THEN FOR THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF ONE SAYING LET THINE HEART BE TOWARDS THE HIGH-WAY EVEN THE WAY THAT THOU WENTEST TURN AGAIN BUT BY THIS TIME THE WATERS WERE GREATLY RISEN
CASSIM HAD NEVER EXPECTED SUCH AN INCIDENT AND WAS SO ALARMED AT THE DANGER HE WAS IN THAT THE MORE HE ENDEAVORED TO REMEMBER THE WORD SESAME THE MORE HIS MEMORY WAS CONFOUNDED AND HE HAD AS MUCH FORGOTTEN IT AS IF HE HAD NEVER HEARD IT MENTIONED HE THREW DOWN THE BAGS HE HAD LOADED HIMSELF WITH AND WALKED DISTRACTEDLY UP AND DOWN THE CAVE WITHOUT HAVING THE LEAST REGARD TO THE RICHES THAT WERE ROUND HIM
AND SPREADING ONE OF THE BEDS UPON THE GROUND LAYING MY TWO PISTOLS JUST AT MY HEAD AND MY GUN AT LENGTH BY ME I WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SLEPT VERY QUIETLY ALL NIGHT FOR I WAS VERY WEARY AND HEAVY
ON OUR FIRST LANDING WE HAD DIVIDED OUR PROVISIONS AS EQUALLY AS WE COULD AND THUS EVERY ONE LIVED A LONGER OR SHORTER TIME ACCORDING TO HIS TEMPERANCE AND THE USE HE MADE OF HIS PROVISIONS
IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER A WARDER ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRIOR AYMER OF JORVAULX AND THE GOOD KNIGHT BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT COMMANDER OF THE VALIANT ORDER OF KNIGHTS TEMPLARS WITH A SMALL RETINUE REQUESTED HOSPITALITY AND LODGING FOR THE NIGHT BEING ON THEIR WAY TO A TOURNAMENT WHICH WAS TO BE HELD NOT FAR FROM ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCHE
WHY
IT WAS A MISERABLE AND SQUALID VILLAGE BUT FOR ALL THAT MR BERTRAM WAS DETERMINED TO EVICT THEM AND ALL THEIR POOR BELONGINGS
AT LAST I ARRIVED HAPPILY AT BAGDAD
WELL SAID CHRISTIAN THIS IS FEARFUL
BUT I SPEEDILY SET FORWARD AGAIN AND TRAVELLED SEVEN DAYS AVOIDING THOSE PLACES WHICH SEEMED TO BE INHABITED AND LIVED FOR THE MOST PART UPON COCOANUTS WHICH SERVED ME BOTH FOR MEAT AND DRINK
BUT THE MONKEY LOOKING IN AT EVERY SIDE PUT ME INTO SUCH A FRIGHT THAT I WANTED PRESENCE OF MIND TO CONCEAL MYSELF UNDER THE BED AS I MIGHT EASILY HAVE DONE
AFTER HIM CAME THE HAUGHTY PRINCE OF ARRAGON AND SAYING LET ME HAVE WHAT I DESERVE--SURELY I DESERVE THE LADY HE CHOSE THE SILVER ONE AND FOUND INSIDE A FOOL'S HEAD
IT WAS STATED THAT THE ASSAILANT HAD BEEN SEEN EARLIER IN THE DAY WEARING A SMUGGLER'S CUTLASS
THEY THEREFORE WENT UP HERE WITH MUCH AGILITY AND SPEED THOUGH THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH THE CITY WAS FRAMED WAS HIGHER THAN THE CLOUDS
HOW THEY HAD COOKED IT I KNEW NOT OR WHAT IT WAS BUT THEY WERE ALL DANCING IN I KNOW NOT HOW MANY BARBAROUS GESTURES AND FIGURES THEIR OWN WAY ROUND THE FIRE
AFTER SUCH A DISCOVERY I CAN TREAT YOU NO MORE AS A SLAVE BUT AS A BROTHER
AND BETTER HELP THAN THINE AND THY RANGERS WOULD I NEVER SEEK WERE IT AT MY UTMOST NEED SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR-HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
I SUPPED ON PART OF MY PROVISIONS BUT THE SERPENTS WHICH BEGAN HISSING ROUND ME PUT ME INTO SUCH EXTREME FEAR THAT I DID NOT SLEEP
WE HUNTED AGAIN IN THE FINE FOREST I HAD THEN TRAVERSED WITH A GAY PARTY OF FRENCH NOBLES AND SPORTSMEN
FOR I SAW EVIDENTLY THAT IF WE HAD KEPT ON BOARD WE HAD BEEN ALL SAFE THAT IS TO SAY WE HAD ALL GOT SAFE ON SHORE AND I HAD NOT BEEN SO MISERABLE AS TO BE LEFT ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF ALL COMFORT AND COMPANY AS I NOW WAS
WHILE I WAS THUS EMPLOYED THE ENEMY DISCHARGED SEVERAL THOUSAND ARROWS MANY OF WHICH STUCK IN MY HANDS AND FACE
BUT ALL HIS FATHER'S ENDEAVORS TO KEEP HIM TO HIS WORK WERE VAIN FOR NO SOONER WAS HIS BACK TURNED THAN HE WAS GONE FOR THAT DAY
WE WAITED A GREAT WHILE THOUGH VERY IMPATIENT FOR THEIR REMOVING
I VENTURED TO UNSCREW ONE OF MY CHAIRS WHICH WERE ALWAYS FASTENED TO THE FLOOR
FOR FIRST MUST GIVE PLACE TO LAST BECAUSE LAST MUST HAVE HIS TIME TO COME
THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES WENT TO BEAT THE ROADS AGAIN AND TO ATTACK THE CARAVANS THEY MIGHT MEET
THERE WAS A STILE TO PASS FROM THIS FIELD INTO THE NEXT
I HAD ANOTHER BELT NOT SO BROAD AND FASTENED IN THE SAME MANNER WHICH HUNG OVER MY SHOULDER AND AT THE END OF IT UNDER MY LEFT ARM HUNG TWO POUCHES BOTH MADE OF GOAT'S SKIN TOO IN ONE OF WHICH HUNG MY POWDER IN THE OTHER MY SHOT
SO THAT I COULD NOT TELL WHAT WAS BEST FOR THEM UNLESS THEY HAD A MIND TO TAKE THEIR FATE IN THE ISLAND
IT WAS MEG MERRILIES THE GIPSY
BUT HOPES NEVERTHELESS THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL ACCEPT OF IT AND MAKE IT AGREEABLE TO THE PRINCESS AND WITH THE GREATER CONFIDENCE SINCE HE HAS ENDEAVORED TO CONFORM TO THE CONDITIONS YOU WERE PLEASED TO IMPOSE THE SULTAN OVERPOWERED AT THE SIGHT OF SUCH MORE THAN ROYAL MAGNIFICENCE REPLIED WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE WORDS OF ALADDIN'S MOTHER
HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOWEVER HAVING EVER SEEN THE MAN BEFORE
AT MY COMING BACK I SHOT AT A GREAT BIRD WHICH I SAW SITTING UPON A TREE ON THE SIDE OF A GREAT WOOD
THEY FOUND ALL THE BAGS WHICH CASSIM HAD BROUGHT TO THE DOOR TO BE READY TO LOAD HIS MULES AND CARRIED THEM AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES BUT THEY DID NOT MISS WHAT ALI BABA HAD TAKEN AWAY BEFORE
THEN I SAW THAT ONE CAME TO PASSION AND BROUGHT HIM A BAG OF TREASURE AND POURED IT DOWN AT HIS FEET THE WHICH HE TOOK UP AND REJOICED THEREIN
ON THE MARKET PLACE AND WHEREVER HE CAN HE DENOUNCES THE RATE OF INTEREST I CHARGE AND--WORSE THAN THAT--HE LENDS OUT MONEY FREELY SO WHEN BASSANIO CAME TO HIM TO ASK FOR A LOAN OF THREE THOUSAND DUCATS TO ANTONIO FOR THREE MONTHS SHYLOCK HID HIS HATRED AND TURNING TO ANTONIO SAID--"HARSHLY AS YOU HAVE TREATED ME I WOULD BE FRIENDS WITH YOU AND HAVE YOUR LOVE
AND YET HE HAD ALL THE SWEETNESS AND SOFTNESS OF A EUROPEAN IN HIS COUNTENANCE TOO ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SMILED
FIVE HUNDRED CARPENTERS AND ENGINEERS WERE IMMEDIATELY SET AT WORK TO PREPARE THE GREATEST ENGINE THEY HAD
AFTER HE HAD AGAIN FINISHED HIS INHUMAN SUPPER ON ANOTHER OF OUR SEAMEN HE LAY DOWN ON HIS BACK AND FELL ASLEEP
THE ISLAND WAS VERY WELL PEOPLED PLENTIFUL IN EVERYTHING AND THE CAPITAL A PLACE OF GREAT TRADE

ALI BABA SAID HE I AM SURPRISED AT YOU
BUT MAY MY SIN BE FORGIVEN
SO THINGS WENT ON UNTIL LUCY BERTRAM WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND HER FATHER HAD BECOME A WEAK AND POOR OLD MAN AND THEN GLOSSIN DETERMINED TO PLAY HIS LAST CARD
AFTER WHICH IT LESSENED FOR A WHILE AND THEN PARTED INTO BRANCHES
THIS I DELIVERED IN A FIRM TONE LIKE A PERSON WHO WAS JEALOUS LEST HIS COURAGE SHOULD BE CALLED IN QUESTION
THE OTHER THAT WHEN I NEXT CALL FOR YOU BE IT IN CHURCH OR MARKET AT WEDDING OR AT BURIAL MEAL-TIME OR FASTING THAT YE LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE AND COME WITH ME THAT WILL DO YOU LITTLE GOOD MOTHER ANSWERED BROWN
AND I SENT THE MAN THAT HAD PARLEYED WITH THEM AND TWO MORE WHO BOUND THEM ALL
THE ONLY THING I DESIRE OF YOU IS TO SHOW ME THE HOUSE WHERE YOU STITCHED UP THE DEAD BODY IF I WERE DISPOSED TO DO YOU THAT FAVOR REPLIED BABA MUSTAPHA I ASSURE YOU I CANNOT
BUT NO ANSWER
WE THEREFORE TRUSTED OURSELVES TO THE MERCY OF THE WAVES AND IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THE BOAT WAS OVERSET BY A SUDDEN FLURRY FROM THE NORTH
I NEVER SAW HIM ALL THE WHILE GIVE SO MUCH AS ONE PLEASANT LOOK TILL HE PERCEIVED HE HAD WOUNDED APOLLYON WITH HIS TWO EDGED SWORD
FOR BEING CANNIBALS THEIR DESIGN WAS TO EAT US AS SOON AS WE GREW FAT
AND I WONDERED HOW I COULD FORBEAR WHEN I SAW HIS DISHES OF THE SIZE OF A SILVER THREEPENCE A LEG OF PORK HARDLY A MOUTHFUL A CUP NOT SO BIG AS A NUTSHELL
CONSIDER THAT BY MARRYING MORGIANA YOU MARRY THE PRESERVER OF MY FAMILY AND YOUR OWN THE SON FAR FROM SHOWING ANY DISLIKE READILY CONSENTED TO THE MARRIAGE
YES BOTH OBSTINATE AND PLIABLE
IT SEEMED TO BE A DELICIOUS GARDEN
THOU THE DAUGHTER OF TORQUIL WOLFGANGER SAID CEDRIC
WHEN THE FEAST WAS CONCLUDED THE KING ATTENDED BY IVANHOE WAMBA AND GURTH PROCEEDED ON HIS WAY TO CONINGSBURGH
SINDBAD SAID THE KING YOU ARE WELCOME
WHAT SAY YOU MY LADS ALL THE ROBBERS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED OF THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSAL
YES GENTLEMEN HE ADDED SPEAKING TO THE WHOLE COMPANY I ASSURE YOU THAT MY SUFFERINGS HAVE BEEN OF A NATURE SO EXTRAORDINARY AS WOULD DEPRIVE THE GREATEST MISER OF HIS LOVE OF RICHES
AND THE LEAST CAPFUL OF WIND WOULD HAVE OVERSET ALL MY NAVIGATION
AFTER HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TWICE BY SOUND OF TRUMPET IT BECAME NECESSARY TO NAME ANOTHER
BEING ALL MET AND THE CAPTAIN WITH ME I CAUSED THE MEN TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE ME AND I TOLD THEM I HAD A FULL ACCOUNT OF THEIR VILLANOUS BEHAVIOR TO THE CAPTAIN AND HOW THEY HAD RUN AWAY WITH THE SHIP AND WERE PREPARING TO COMMIT FURTHER ROBBERIES BUT THAT PROVIDENCE HAD ENSNARED THEM IN THEIR OWN WAYS AND THAT THEY WERE FALLEN INTO THE PIT WHICH THEY HAD DUG FOR OTHERS
THOU DIDST SINFULLY SLEEP AND LOSE THY CHOICE THING
I HAVE A MIND THOU SHOULDST MARRY THAT SO THOU MAYST STAY IN MY DOMINIONS AND THINK NO MORE OF THY OWN COUNTRY I DURST NOT RESIST THE PRINCE'S WILL AND HE GAVE ME ONE OF THE LADIES OF HIS COURT NOBLE BEAUTIFUL AND RICH
THEY ACCORDINGLY QUICKENED THEIR PACE IN ORDER TO GET AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH THEY WERE TRAVERSING
THEN WITH A GRIM AND SURLY VOICE HE BID THEM AWAKE AND ASKED THEM WHENCE THEY WERE
YIELD THEE RESCUE OR NO RESCUE OR THOU ART BUT A DEAD MAN I WILL NOT YIELD REPLIED THE NORMAN FAINTLY TO AN UNKNOWN CONQUEROR
BUT USE THEM NOT RASHLY
THEN THEY DRANK MORE
THE SULTAN HAVING OPENED THE DOOR WENT TO THE BEDSIDE KISSED THE PRINCESS ON THE FOREHEAD BUT WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED TO SEE HER LOOK SO MELANCHOLY
RIDE YOUR WAYS ELLAN GOWAN
SOMEBODY INTENDS MY MASTER NO GOOD
BUT WHEN THE SAVAGE ESCAPING CAME THITHER HE MADE NOTHING OF IT THOUGH THE TIDE WAS THEN UP BUT PLUNGING IN SWAM THROUGH IN ABOUT THIRTY STROKES OR THEREABOUTS LANDED AND RAN WITH EXCEEDING STRENGTH AND SWIFTNESS
AND AT LENGTH MY WIFE ON HER LITTLE PALFREY
WE ARRIVED IN THE DOWNS ON THE 13TH OF APRIL 1702
TIS ACCORDING TO MY WISH SAID CHRISTIAN HERE IS THE EASIEST GOING
AND WHEN SHE HAD DONE SO HE FELL DOWN AND KISSED IT SEVERAL TIMES CRYING OUT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES MY POOR BROTHER
NEXT MORNING THEY RETURNED TO THE CAPITAL OF THE ISLAND TOOK ME WITH THEM AND PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING
WHEN I HAD DONE THIS I BLOCKED UP THE DOOR OF THE TENT WITH SOME BOARDS WITHIN AND AN EMPTY CHEST SET UP ON END WITHOUT
TIME ROLLED ON AND WHEN LITTLE HARRY BERTRAM GREW TO BE FOUR YEARS OLD HE WAS ALREADY A GREAT FAVOURITE WITH DOMINIE SAMPSON WHO HAD ACTED AS HIS TUTOR AND WAS HIS CONSTANT COMPANION
AS THE PILGRIM MOUNTED HE REACHED HIS HAND TO GURTH WHO KISSED IT WITH THE UTMOST POSSIBLE VENERATION
THOUGH I BELIEVE VERILY HAD THE CALM WEATHER HELD I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT AWAY THE WHOLE SHIP PIECE BY PIECE
IT WAS A VERY FIERCE STORM
THE NUMBER OF THEM BROKE ALL MY MEASURES
I HEARD A NOISE OVER MY HEAD LIKE THE CLAPPING OF WINGS AND THEN BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THE WOFUL CONDITION I WAS IN
THE STORM CONTINUED SEVERAL DAYS AND BROUGHT US BEFORE THE PORT OF AN ISLAND WHICH THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY UNWILLING TO ENTER
THEY CLOSED ROUND THE FIRE AND COMMENCED TO DRINK HOLDING CONSULTATION TOGETHER IN A STRANGE GIBBERISH WHICH HE COULD NOT ALTOGETHER UNDERSTAND
BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY I BECKONED TO HIM TO COME WITH ME AND LET HIM KNOW I WOULD GIVE HIM SOME CLOTHES
HE FOUND BY THEIR EXAMPLE THAT THEIR HEADS WERE NOT SO GOOD AS THEIR HANDS ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT COMMISSION
THIS WAS ALL MY PROVISION
HERE I FOUND THAT THE SHIP WAS BULGED AND HAD A GREAT DEAL OF WATER IN HER HOLD BUT THAT SHE LAY SO ON THE SIDE OF A BANK OF HARD SAND OR RATHER EARTH THAT HER STERN LAY LIFTED UP UPON THE BANK AND HER HEAD LOW ALMOST TO THE WATER
FAR FROM LESSENING YOUR WEALTH I DESIGN TO AUGMENT IT AND WILL NOT LET YOU QUIT MY DOMINIONS WITHOUT MARKS OF MY LIBERALITY HE THEN CHARGED ONE OF HIS OFFICERS TO TAKE CARE OF ME AND ORDERED PEOPLE TO SERVE ME AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
TO WHICH HE REPLIED THEY ARE STURDY ROGUES THEY CHUSE RATHER TO BEAR ALL HARDSHIP THAN TO MAKE AWAY THEMSELVES
NOR COULD ANYTHING HAVE PRESERVED THE WINDOWS BUT THE STRONG LATTICE WIRES PLACED ON THE OUTSIDE AGAINST ACCIDENTS IN TRAVELLING
THE DECREE CAUSED SO MUCH DISCONTENT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOSE AFFECTION ALADDIN HAD SECURED BY HIS LARGESSES AND CHARITIES THAT THE SULTAN FEARFUL OF AN INSURRECTION WAS OBLIGED TO GRANT HIM HIS LIFE
THEN SAID APOLLYON I AM SURE OF THEE NOW AND WITH THAT HE HAD ALMOST PRESSED HIM TO DEATH SO THAT CHRISTIAN BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF LIFE
I COULD GIVE MORE BUT THAT MY HAND LACKS MEANS ROSALIND AND CELIA WHEN THEY WERE ALONE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE HANDSOME WRESTLER AND ROSALIND CONFESSED THAT SHE LOVED HIM AT FIRST SIGHT
NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HER
YET I SAW ABUNDANCE OF FOWLS BUT KNEW NOT THEIR KINDS
BUT WITHAL I TOOK CARE TO MAKE MY COURT REGULARLY TO THE MAHARAJA AND CONVERSED WITH THE GOVERNORS AND PETTY KINGS HIS TRIBUTARIES THAT WERE ABOUT HIM
BUT HIS ANTAGONIST AROSE NOT
SHE TOOK THE CHINA DISH WHICH SHE HAD SET DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE UNTIED IT AND PRESENTED IT TO THE SULTAN
SEA-NYMPHS HOURLY RING HIS KNELL
WHEN ASKED TO SAY WHERE HE HAD SPENT THE NIGHT ON WHICH IT WAS TAKEN HIS PROMISE TO MEG MERRILIES CAME TO HIS MIND AND HE REPLIED THAT HE MUST REFUSE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
I MADE SEVERAL OTHERS FOR THE MINISTERS AND PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD WHICH GAINED ME GREAT REPUTATION AND REGARD
HE STARTED UP ON HEARING IT AND TURNING TOWARDS GLOSSIN HE ADDRESSED HIM IN TONES OF PASSION AND INDIGNATION
WHILE I WAS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TWO RATS CREPT UP THE CURTAINS AND RAN SMELLING BACKWARD AND FORWARD ON THE BED
I FIRST LAID ALL THE PLANKS OR BOARDS UPON IT THAT I COULD GET AND HAVING CONSIDERED WELL WHAT I MOST WANTED I GOT THREE OF THE SEAMEN'S CHESTS WHICH I HAD BROKEN OPEN AND EMPTIED AND LOWERED THEM DOWN UPON MY RAFT
TRULY SAID CHRISTIAN I DO NOT KNOW
AND BY WHAT MIRACLE DID YOU ESCAPE THEIR CRUELTY I RELATED TO THEM THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE JUST MENTIONED AT WHICH THEY WERE WONDERFULLY SURPRISED
AFTERWARDS I VISITED RUSSIA AND REMAINED THERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR
IN THIS EXERCISE I ONCE MET AN ACCIDENT WHICH HAD LIKE TO HAVE COST ME MY LIFE
AFTER HE WENT TO THE IRON GATE FOR THAT MUST BE OPENED TOO BUT THAT LOCK WENT DAMNABLE HARD YET THE KEY DID OPEN IT
AT LAST IT BROKE OUT INTO TEARS AND IN A LITTLE WHILE AFTER I RECOVERED MY SPEECH
WOULD TO GOD SHE THEN SAID HE WERE HERE SAFELY ARRIVED AND ABLE TO BEAR ARMS IN THE APPROACHING TOURNEY
BUT FOR MYSELF AND THE REST WHO WERE NOT SO IMPRUDENT THE PIRATES SAVED US AND CARRIED US INTO A REMOTE ISLAND WHERE THEY SOLD US
THE RESULT OF HIS CONSULTATION INFORMED HIM TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT THE LAMP WAS IN THE PALACE
I SOON EMPTIED THE HOGSHEAD OF THE BREAD AND WRAPPED IT UP PARCEL BY PARCEL IN PIECES OF THE SAILS WHICH I CUT OUT
ONE DAY AS ALADDIN WAS WALKING ABOUT THE TOWN HE HEARD AN ORDER PROCLAIMED COMMANDING THE PEOPLE TO SHUT UP THEIR SHOPS AND HOUSES AND KEEP WITHIN DOORS WHILE THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR THE SULTAN'S DAUGHTER WENT TO THE BATH AND RETURNED
WHAT WAST THOU ONCE
I LEFT OFF TO WATCH AND BE SOBER
HE BROKE THE SEAL WITH APPARENT AGITATION AND READ THE WORDS TAKE HEED TO YOURSELF FOR THE DEVIL IS UNCHAINED HE TURNED AS PALE AS DEATH
THOUGH THIS WAS ALL BUT A FICTION OF HIS OWN YET IT HAD ITS DESIRED EFFECT
SECOND TO NONE I SAY WHO EVER DREW SWORD IN DEFENCE OF THE HOLY LAND
THE PRINCESS DAZZLED TO SEE SO MUCH RICHES COLLECTED IN ONE PLACE SAID TO ALADDIN
I ANSWERED THAT WAS NEEDLESS AND WOULD TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME
HE IS AN HONEST MAN THEREFORE DO AS I BID YOU MORGIANA OBEYED THOUGH WITH NO LITTLE RELUCTANCE AND HAD A CURIOSITY TO SEE THIS MAN WHO ATE NO SALT
HE SAT WITH HIS EYES LOOKING DOWN TO THE GROUND HIS HANDS FOLDED TOGETHER
THIS DONE THEY SANG AS FOLLOWS
ALADDIN'S MOTHER EMBOLDENED BY THE SIGHT OF THESE RICH JEWELS AND FEARFUL LEST HER SON SHOULD BE GUILTY OF GREATER EXTRAVAGANCE COMPLIED WITH HIS REQUEST AND PROMISED TO GO EARLY IN THE NEXT MORNING TO THE PALACE OF THE SULTAN
HAVING GREETED HIM AND HIS FRIENDS WITH THE MOURNFUL CEREMONY SUITED TO THE OCCASION CEDRIC LED HIS KNIGHTLY GUEST TO ANOTHER APARTMENT WHERE HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM WHEN THE BLACK KNIGHT TOOK HIS HAND
BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT SEEN ARE ETERNAL
BUT OUR VOYAGE WAS OTHERWISE DETERMINED
HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE THE SIGNAL FOR RETIRING FROM THE LISTS WHEN A SMALL BILLET WAS PUT INTO HIS HAND
AND BESIDES THEY SHOT ANOTHER FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AS WE DO BOMBS IN EUROPE WHEREOF MANY I SUPPOSE FELL ON MY BODY THOUGH I FELT THEM NOT AND SOME ON MY FACE WHICH I IMMEDIATELY COVERED WITH MY LEFT HAND
I WOULD THEREFORE SPEAK WITH THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
THE CASKETS WERE OF GOLD SILVER AND LEAD
WRETCHED WOMAN WHO HAS DONE THIS EXCLAIMED BROWN
NOTWITHSTANDING MY FAINTING THE ILL-NATURED OLD FELLOW STILL KEPT HIS SEAT UPON MY NECK
AND SEPARATING US AS WELL FROM THE BOAT AS FROM ONE ANOTHER GAVE US NOT TIME HARDLY TO SAY O GOD FOR WE WERE ALL SWALLOWED UP IN A MOMENT
AND PRESENTLY STARTING UP I HEARD A MAN CALL ME BY THE NAME OF GOVERNOR
I WAS BUT LIGHTLY CLOTHED AND OF THIS I FELT THE INCONVENIENCE THE MORE I ADVANCED NORTHEAST
HERE I GAVE HIM BREAD AND A BUNCH OF RAISINS TO EAT AND A DRAUGHT OF WATER WHICH I FOUND HE WAS INDEED IN GREAT DISTRESS FOR FROM HIS RUNNING
THE ARMS AND THE BODY OF THE DECEASED KNIGHT ARE AT THE WILL OF THE VICTOR HIS FURTHER SPEECH WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CLATTERING OF HORSES FEET AND THE BLACK KNIGHT FOLLOWED BY A NUMEROUS BAND OF MEN AT-ARMS GALLOPED INTO THE LISTS
WHICH BY THIS METHOD INDEED I SO EFFECTUALLY SECURED THAT WHEN THESE LITTLE STAKES BEGAN TO GROW I HAD PLANTED THEM SO VERY THICK THAT I WAS FORCED TO PULL SOME OF THEM UP AGAIN
THEY ASSURED ME THAT EVERY NIGHT A NOISE OF DRUMS WAS HEARD THERE WHENCE THE MARINERS FANCIED THAT IT WAS THE RESIDENCE OF DEGIAL
NIGHT AND DARKNESS OVERTOOK ME
I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I CONTINUED SO
HOW I LIKED THE VICTUALS HE GAVE ME
UPON THE ENTRANCE OF RICHARD THE SAXON AROSE GRAVELY TO BID HIM WELCOME
IT SEEMS THAT UPON THE FIRST MOMENT I WAS DISCOVERED SLEEPING ON THE GROUND AFTER MY LANDING THE EMPEROR HAD EARLY NOTICE OF IT BY AN EXPRESS
BUT PATIENCE WAS VERY QUIET
THEN DID THE PRISONERS CONSULT BETWEEN THEMSELVES WHETHER TWAS BEST TO TAKE HIS COUNSEL OR NO
SHE WILL PRESENTLY RETURN FROM THE BATH
BUT AS I CANNOT MARRY HER WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF OF YOUR SON BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT HER IN ROYAL STATE YOU MAY TELL HIM I WILL FULFIL MY PROMISE AS SOON AS HE SHALL SEND ME FORTY TRAYS OF MASSY GOLD FULL OF THE SAME SORT OF JEWELS YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE ME A PRESENT OF AND CARRIED BY THE LIKE NUMBER OF BLACK SLAVES WHO SHALL BE LED BY AS MANY YOUNG AND HANDSOME WHITE SLAVES ALL DRESSED MAGNIFICENTLY
BUT IN THE MORNING I FELL ASLEEP
I FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A RICH MERCHANT WHO AS SOON AS HE BOUGHT ME TOOK ME TO HIS HOUSE TREATED ME WELL AND CLAD ME HANDSOMELY AS A SLAVE
AND THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE WAS A LITTLE INDIAN BOY WHOM TITANIA HAD TAKEN TO BE ONE OF HER FOLLOWERS
THIS PROCLAMATION INSPIRED ALADDIN WITH AN EAGER DESIRE TO SEE THE PRINCESS'S FACE WHICH HE DETERMINED TO GRATIFY BY PLACING HIMSELF BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE BATH SO THAT HE COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE HER FACE
THE CAPTAIN FINDING THAT THEIR DESIGN HAD PROVED ABORTIVE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE PLACE OF RENDEZVOUS AND TOLD HIS TROOP THAT THEY HAD LOST THEIR LABOR AND MUST RETURN TO THEIR CAVE
IT CANNOT BE THEN--IT CANNOT BE
WHEN THE MORNING OF THE TOURNAMENT ARRIVED THE FIELD OF CONTEST AT ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCHE PRESENTED A BRILLIANT AND ROMANTIC SCENE
THE FEATURES WHICH WERE EXPOSED WERE THOSE OF A YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY-FIVE
I STAYED WITH THEM TILL THEY HAD GATHERED THEIR QUANTITY OF PEPPER AND THEN SAILED WITH THEM TO THE ISLAND FROM WHENCE THEY HAD COME
BUT THERE WAS MORE WORK TO DO YET FOR I PERCEIVED THE SAVAGE WHOM I HAD KNOCKED DOWN WAS NOT KILLED BUT STUNNED WITH THE BLOW AND BEGAN TO COME TO HIMSELF
AND AS HE READ HE WEPT AND TREMBLED
BUT YOU HAD BETTER HEAR THE STORY IN YOUR OWN CHAMBER
IF I SHOULD NOT BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU DO ME THE FAVOR TO LET ME PASS THE NIGHT WITH YOU AND I SHALL BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED BY YOUR HOSPITALITY THOUGH ALI BABA HAD SEEN THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS IN THE FOREST AND HAD HEARD HIM SPEAK IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW HIM IN THE DISGUISE OF AN OIL MERCHANT
AND THROUGH THIS RIOTOUS CROWD RICHARD AND HIS FOLLOWERS WITH DIFFICULTY MADE THEIR WAY
I KEPT THE TREES WHICH AT FIRST WERE NO MORE THAN STAKES BUT WERE NOW GROWN VERY FIRM AND TALL ALWAYS CUT SO THAT THEY MIGHT SPREAD AND GROW THICK AND WILD AND MAKE THE MORE AGREEABLE SHADE WHICH THEY DID EFFECTUALLY TO MY MIND
INTER

I SHALL NEVER FORGET WITH WHAT UNWILLINGNESS GLUMDALCLITCH CONSENTED NOR THE STRICT CHARGE SHE GAVE THE PAGE TO BE CAREFUL OF ME BURSTING AT THE SAME TIME INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS AS IF SHE HAD SOME FOREBODING OF WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN
WE FOUND IT TO BE A PALACE ELEGANTLY BUILT AND VERY LOFTY WITH A GATE OF EBONY OF TWO LEAVES WHICH WE OPENED
I HAVE ALSO MADE A VOW NEVER TO LEAVE BAGDAD PERCEIVING THAT THE CALIPH INSISTED UPON MY COMPLIANCE I SUBMITTED AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS WILLING TO OBEY
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE TOOK ME FOR A YOUNG ONE OF HIS OWN SPECIES BY HIS OFTEN STROKING MY FACE VERY GENTLY WITH HIS OTHER PAW
THEN SHE COUNSELLED HIM THAT WHEN HE AROSE IN THE MORNING HE SHOULD BEAT THEM WITHOUT ANY MERCY
LIVED TO UNITE THYSELF WITH THE VILE TYRANT WHO SLEW THY NEAREST AND DEAREST I HATED HIM WITH ALL MY SOUL REPLIED ULRICA
THE ALARM HAD NOW SPREAD THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE THAT KENNEDY'S MURDERER HAD BEEN TAKEN ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED YEARS BEFORE
BUT WE WERE OBLIGED TO CAST ANCHOR
BUT THE DANGER IS MUCH GREATER WHEN THE MINISTERS THEMSELVES ARE COMMANDED TO SHOW THEIR DEXTERITY
YOU WILL FIND IT WILL COME EASILY ALADDIN DID AS THE MAGICIAN BADE HIM RAISED THE STONE WITH EASE AND LAID IT ON ONE SIDE
HE HAD HEARD TOO ALL THE PERSONS OF REPUTE IN THE CITY TALKING OF A WOMAN CALLED FATIMA WHO WAS RETIRED FROM THE WORLD AND OF THE MIRACLES SHE WROUGHT
BUT HE BADE HER NOT TO BE AFRAID
IT WAS FURTHER INTIMATED TO HER THAT SHOULD SHE FAIL TO DO SO OR IF HER CHAMPION SHOULD BE DISCOMFITED SHE SHOULD DIE THE DEATH OF A SORCERESS ACCORDING TO DOOM
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I BEGAN TO CONCEIVE SOME IMPERFECT IDEA OF COURTS AND MINISTERS
AND THIS I THOUGHT SO JUST A REPROOF THAT I RESOLVED FOR THE FUTURE TO HAVE TWO OR THREE YEARS CORN BEFOREHAND
HE RETURNED TO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT AND WITHOUT MENTIONING A WORD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED SAT DOWN AND COMPLAINED OF A GREAT PAIN WHICH HAD SUDDENLY SEIZED HIS HEAD
IN THIS ISLAND IS ALSO FOUND THE RHINOCEROS AN ANIMAL LESS THAN THE ELEPHANT BUT LARGER THAN THE BUFFALO
THIS BEING WITHIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE SHORE WHERE I WAS AND THE SHIP SEEMING TO STAND UPRIGHT STILL I WISHED MYSELF ON BOARD THAT AT LEAST I MIGHT SAVE SOME NECESSARY THINGS FOR MY USE
BUT I COULD NOT SEE HOW THIS COULD BE DONE IN THEIR COUNTRY WHERE THE SMALLEST WHERRY WAS EQUAL TO A FIRST-RATE MAN-OF-WAR AMONG US
AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE CAVERN I LOST ALL LIGHT AND THE STREAM CARRIED ME I KNEW NOT WHITHER
PLEASANT AS THE SPRING COMFORTABLE AS THE SUMMER FRUITFUL AS AUTUMN DREADFUL AS WINTER
LASTLY THAT UPON HIS SOLEMN OATH TO OBSERVE ALL THE ABOVE ARTICLES THE SAID MAN-MOUNTAIN SHALL HAVE A DAILY ALLOWANCE OF MEAT AND DRINK SUFFICIENT FOR THE SUPPORT OF 1724 OF OUR SUBJECTS WITH FREE ACCESS TO OUR ROYAL PERSON AND OTHER MARKS OF OUR FAVOR
AND THROUGH THE SEVEN HOLES I CONTRIVED TO PLANT THE MUSKETS OF WHICH I TOOK NOTICE THAT I HAD GOT SEVEN ON SHORE OUT OF THE SHIP
TWO DAYS AFTER THIS ADVENTURE THE EMPEROR HAVING ORDERED THAT PART OF HIS ARMY WHICH QUARTERS IN AND ABOUT HIS METROPOLIS TO BE IN READINESS TOOK A FANCY OF DIVERTING HIMSELF IN A VERY SINGULAR MANNER
GOD ORDERED IT OTHERWISE
SO HE SAID TO PUCK THESE TWO YOUNG MEN ARE GOING TO FIGHT
THEY PROCEEDED TO A HIGH MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION THEY TOOK UP A LARGE STONE WHICH FORMED THE MOUTH OF A DEEP PIT AND LET DOWN THE BODY WITH ALL ITS APPAREL AND JEWELS
BUT HERE A RIVER OF FRESH WATER RUNS FROM THE SEA INTO A DARK CAVERN WHOSE ENTRANCE IS VERY HIGH AND SPACIOUS
ON THE 16TH DAY OF JUNE 1703 A BOY ON THE TOPMAST DISCOVERED LAND
THEY BEGAN WITH MANY COMPLIMENTS UPON MY VALOR AND GENEROSITY INVITED ME TO THAT KINGDOM IN THE EMPEROR THEIR MASTER'S NAME AND DESIRED ME TO SHOW THEM SOME PROOFS OF MY PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH OF WHICH THEY HAD HEARD SO MANY WONDERS
LET THERE BE ALSO KITCHENS AND STOREHOUSES STABLES FULL OF THE FINEST HORSES WITH THEIR EQUERRIES AND GROOMS AND HUNTING EQUIPAGE OFFICERS ATTENDANTS AND SLAVES BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO FORM A RETINUE FOR THE PRINCESS AND MYSELF
WE MARCHED TILL WE CAME TO THE CAPITAL OF SERENDIB FOR IT WAS IN THAT ISLAND I HAD LANDED
THIS PALACE IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD
WHEN THE TEMPLAR REACHED THE HALL OF THE CASTLE HE FOUND DE BRACY THERE ALREADY
WHICH WAS AGAIN LAID ACROSS WITH SMALLER STICKS INSTEAD OF LATHS AND THEN THATCHED OVER A GREAT THICKNESS WITH THE RICE-STRAW WHICH WAS STRONG LIKE REEDS
TO WHICH BABA MUSTAPHA REPLIED THAT AS HE DID NOT LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD HE COULD NOT TELL
THERE ALSO YOU SHALL SERVE HIM CONTINUALLY WITH PRAISE WITH SHOUTING AND THANKSGIVING WHOM YOU DESIRED TO SERVE IN THE WORLD THOUGH WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF THE INFIRMITY OF YOUR FLESH
SHYLOCK'S GRIEF AND ANGER WERE TERRIBLE TO SEE
ON AN ELEVATED SEAT AT THE UPPER END OF THE GREAT HALL DIRECTLY BEFORE THE ACCUSED SAT THE GRAND MASTER OF THE TEMPLE IN FULL AND AMPLE ROBES OF FLOWING WHITE HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE MYSTIC STAFF WHICH BORE THE SYMBOL OF THE ORDER
HIS MAJESTY PRESENTED ME WITH FIFTY PURSES OF TWO HUNDRED SPRUGS APIECE TOGETHER WITH HIS PICTURE AT FULL LENGTH WHICH I PUT IMMEDIATELY INTO ONE OF MY GLOVES TO KEEP IT FROM BEING HURT
BUT BEFORE HE GAVE HER ANY ANSWER ASKED HER WHAT SHE HAD BROUGHT TIED UP IN THE NAPKIN
FORBEAR
AFTER WE HAD FINISHED OUR TRAFFIC IN THAT ISLAND WE PUT TO SEA AGAIN AND TOUCHED AT SEVERAL OTHER PORTS
BUT THEY DESIRED HIM TO LET THEM GO
THE TIDE OF BATTLE SEEMING TO FLOW NOW TOWARD THE SOUTHERN NOW TOWARD THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS AS THE ONE OR THE OTHER PARTY PREVAILED
SCARCELY HAD THEY BEEN REPLACED IN THEIR APARTMENT THAN THE SULTAN CAME TO MAKE HIS COMPLIMENTS TO HIS DAUGHTER WHEN THE PRINCESS COULD NO LONGER CONCEAL FROM HIM THE UNHAPPY TREATMENT SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AS SHE HAD ALREADY RELATED IT TO HER MOTHER
ONCE WITHIN THE CASTLE THE PRISONERS WERE SEPARATED
HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
HE SHORTLY AFTER LED HIM AMID THE SOUNDS OF TRUMPETS HAUTBOYS AND ALL KINDS OF MUSIC TO A MAGNIFICENT ENTERTAINMENT AT WHICH THE SULTAN AND ALADDIN ATE BY THEMSELVES AND THE GREAT LORDS OF THE COURT ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK AND DIGNITY SAT AT DIFFERENT TABLES
I PROSTRATED MYSELF ON THE SHORE TO THANK GOD FOR THIS MERCY AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD I PERCEIVED A SHIP MAKING FOR THE PLACE WHERE I WAS
NOW SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE HAD BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO THE BANISHED DUKE SO THAT FREDERICK HEARD WITH REGRET WHOSE SON ORLANDO WAS AND WOULD NOT BEFRIEND HIM
FOR AS SHE LAY AGROUND AND HIGH OUT OF THE WATER THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN MY REACH TO LAY HOLD OF
THIS RESOLUTION PERHAPS MAY APPEAR VERY BOLD AND DANGEROUS AND I AM CONFIDENT WOULD NOT BE IMITATED BY ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE ON THE LIKE OCCASION
HE SAID I THINK I DO
BUT IT WAS CARRIED AGAINST HIM BY THE WHOLE BOARD AND CONFIRMED BY THE EMPEROR
AND WHY MIGHT I NOT COME THAT WAY FROM THE BOAT AS WELL AS I WAS GOING THAT WAY TO THE BOAT
BUT PROSPERO DREW BACK A CURTAIN AND SHOWED THEM FERDINAND AND MIRANDA PLAYING AT CHESS
AND DOST THOU BID ME DESPAIR I BID THEE REPENT SAID CEDRIC
HIS FOREHEAD VERY HIGH AND LARGE
ADMIT HIM SAID CEDRIC BE HE WHO OR WHAT HE MAY THE PAGE RETIRED
I HAVE PAID MY HOMAGE TO THAT SAINT EVERY YEAR IN GOOD FELLOWSHIP AND SEEN THIS STAG A THOUSAND TIMES EITHER PAINTED IN CHURCHES OR EMBROIDERED IN THE STARS OF HIS KNIGHTS
THE NAME OF THE SLOUGH WAS DISPOND
THE CAPTAIN WAS SO EAGER AT HAVING THIS PRINCIPAL ROGUE SO MUCH IN HIS POWER THAT HE COULD HARDLY HAVE PATIENCE TO LET HIM COME SO NEAR AS TO BE SURE OF HIM FOR THEY ONLY HEARD HIS TONGUE BEFORE
ALL THIS IS TRUE AND MUCH MORE WHICH THOU HAST LEFT OUT
NOT BUT THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF LAUNCHING MY BOAT CAME OFTEN INTO MY HEAD BUT I PUT A STOP TO MY INQUIRIES INTO IT BY THIS FOOLISH ANSWER WHICH I GAVE MYSELF--"LET ME FIRST MAKE IT
THOU HAST DONE IN THIS ACCORDING TO THE PROVERB CHANGED A BAD FOR A WORSE
HOWEVER IN MY OPINION IT WAS EXTREMELY PRUDENT AS WELL AS GENEROUS
AFTER THE JUICE IS THUS DRAWN OUT THE TREE WITHERS AND DIES
YES THAT WAS MY VERY NAME AND THAT IS THE VOICE AND THE FIGURE OF MY KIND OLD MASTER THE FOLLOWING DAY COLONEL MANNERING AND MR PLEYDALL SUCCEEDED IN GETTING SIR ROBERT HAZLEWOOD TO ACCEPT BAIL FOR BERTRAM
FOUR OF HIS PLAYS ARE HERE REPRESENTED BY SHORT STORIES IN WHICH THE PLOT OF EACH PLAY IS BRIEFLY TOLD
WHEN THEY ARE TIRED OUT THEY WILL FALL ASLEEP
THEN SAID EVANGELIST POINTING WITH HIS FINGER OVER A VERY WIDE FIELD DO YOU SEE YONDER WICKET-GATE
AND COLLECTING HERSELF WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST EMOTION SHE ANSWERED NOT YET BUT PRESENTLY SHE WENT QUIETLY IN THIS MANNER TO ALL THE JARS GIVING THE SAME ANSWER TILL SHE CAME TO THE JAR OF OIL
COME FAIRIES AND SHE AND HER TRAIN RODE OFF DOWN THE MOONBEAMS
GLOSSIN AT THAT MOMENT CHANCED TO BE ENGAGED CLOSE BY WITH A SURVEYOR IN REFERENCE TO SOME BUILDING PLANS CONNECTED WITH AN INTENDED ADDITION TO HIS HOUSE
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
HERE I EXCHANGED SOME OF MY DIAMONDS FOR MERCHANDISE
THEY WERE SOON AFTER JOINED BY FRONT-DE-BOEUF
YOU HAVE KILLED THE HOLY WOMAN NO MY PRINCESS ANSWERED ALADDIN WITH EMOTION I HAVE NOT KILLED FATIMA BUT A VILLAIN WHO WOULD HAVE ASSASSINATED ME IF I HAD NOT PREVENTED HIM
YES DEAR SIR SAID CHRISTIAN
ENVY IMMEDIATELY POSSESSED HER BREAST
MY LORD I CONFESS THAT MY FATIGUE PUT ME OUT OF HUMOR AND OCCASIONED ME TO UTTER SOME INDISCREET WORDS WHICH I BEG YOU TO PARDON DO NOT THINK I AM SO UNJUST RESUMED SINDBAD AS TO RESENT SUCH A COMPLAINT
I CRAVE TO REMIND YOU NOBLE THANE HE SAID THAT WHEN WE LAST PARTED YOU PROMISED TO GRANT ME A BOON IT IS GRANTED ERE NAMED NOBLE KNIGHT SAID CEDRIC STILL UNAWARE THAT HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE KING
BUT I MUST KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS TREASURE IS AND HOW I MAY VISIT IT MYSELF WHEN I CHOOSE
NOW CHOOSE BETWEEN SUCH A SCORCHING BED AND THE PAYMENT OF A THOUSAND POUNDS OF SILVER
YOU MUST THINK OF HELPING YOURSELF AND GETTING YOUR LIVELIHOOD
I HAD GOTTEN A SMALL COLD BUT THE POOR GIRL WAS SO ILL AS TO BE CONFINED TO HER CHAMBER
VIZ FIVE MUSKETS THREE FOWLING PIECES AND THREE SWORDS
I AM COME OUT ON PURPOSE TO WITHSTAND THEE
THUS SINDBAD ENDED THE RELATION OF THE SECOND VOYAGE GAVE HINDBAD ANOTHER HUNDRED SEQUINS AND INVITED HIM TO COME THE NEXT DAY TO HEAR THE ACCOUNT OF THE THIRD
FOR THE SAKE OF SAFETY I PLACED MY PISTOLS UNDER MY ARM AND LAY DOWN ON THE SNOW WHERE I SLEPT SO SOUNDLY THAT I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES TILL FULL DAYLIGHT
AN OLD MAN WHO SAW ME AND SUSPECTED MY DESIGN CALLED TO ME AS LOUD AS HE COULD TO RETURN
BUT PATIENCE IS WILLING TO WAIT
FOR I MUST DO THEM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THEY ARE A COMELY RACE OF PEOPLE
WHEN THE MAGICIAN HAD INFORMED HIMSELF OF HIS BROTHER'S FATE HE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY TO AVENGE HIS DEATH AND AT ONCE DEPARTED FOR CHINA
FOUR HUNDRED OF THE SULTAN'S YOUNG PAGES CARRIED FLAMBEAUX ON EACH SIDE WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE ILLUMINATIONS OF THE SULTAN'S AND ALADDIN'S PALACES MADE IT AS LIGHT AS DAY
SOME PALE RED AND OTHERS DEEPER
THEN CEDRIC CALLED THE SAXON STANDS BEFORE ME
1ST
I MENTION THIS CEREMONY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE I WAS IN A FEW WEEKS TIME TO BE THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR ON A SIMILAR OCCASION
THAT I HAD FLED FROM JUSTICE AND IF I DID NOT RETURN IN TWO HOURS I SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF MY TITLE OF NARDAC AND DECLARED A TRAITOR
WE CAME UPON THEM INDEED IN THE DARK SO THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE OUR NUMBER
DURING WHICH TIME WE WERE DRIVEN A LITTLE TO THE EAST OF THE MOLUCCA ISLANDS AND ABOUT THREE DEGREES NORTHWARD OF THE LINE AS OUR CAPTAIN FOUND BY AN OBSERVATION HE TOOK THE 2D OF MAY AT WHICH TIME THE WIND CEASED AND IT WAS A PERFECT CALM WHEREAT I WAS NOT A LITTLE REJOICED
FOR I HAD HEARD THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE CARIBBEAN COAST WERE CANNIBALS OR MAN-EATERS AND I KNEW BY THE LATITUDE THAT I COULD NOT BE FAR FROM THAT SHORE
THE FARTHER I WAS FROM THE OCCASION OF MY FRIGHT THE GREATER MY APPREHENSIONS WERE WHICH IS SOMETHING CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF SUCH THINGS AND ESPECIALLY TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ALL CREATURES IN FEAR
FOR WHAT WAS IT TO ME IF WHEN I HAD CHOSEN A VAST TREE IN THE WOODS AND WITH MUCH TROUBLE CUT IT DOWN IF I HAD BEEN ABLE WITH MY TOOLS TO HEW AND DUB THE OUTSIDE INTO THE PROPER SHAPE OF A BOAT AND BURN OR CUT OUT THE INSIDE TO MAKE IT HOLLOW SO AS TO MAKE A BOAT OF IT--IF AFTER ALL THIS I MUST LEAVE IT JUST THERE WHERE I FOUND IT AND NOT BE ABLE TO LAUNCH IT INTO THE WATER
APOLLYON COULD NOT CRUSH THEE NOR COULD ALL THAT THOU DIDST HEAR OR SEE OR FEEL IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH
AND HIMSELF HIS MATE AND FIVE MORE WENT IN THE OTHER
MONARCH OF ALL MONARCHS TALLER THAN THE SONS OF MEN
THEN EACH MAN WILL HAVE THE LADY WHO LOVES HIM AND THEY WILL ALL THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN ONLY A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM
I WENT DOWN UNDER THE TEMPLAR'S SWORD STUNNED INDEED BUT UNWOUNDED FOR THE BLADE STRUCK ME FLATLINGS BEING AVERTED BY THE GOOD MACE WITH WHICH I WARDED THE BLOW
BUT SOON THE CONFLICT BECAME EVEN MORE DESPERATE WHEN THE BLACK KNIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS LED AN ATTACK UPON THE OUTER BARRIER OF THE BARBICAN
ACCORDINGLY I GAVE THEM THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PLACE AND OF MY COMING TO IT
TALL AND WELL-SHAPED
AND THE MAGICIAN SAID THIS IS NOT WELL NEPHEW
I HAD NEVER HANDLED A TOOL IN MY LIFE
HE HAD HITHERTO FEARED FOR HIS DAUGHTER'S HONOUR
MY GOOD MASTER ANSWERED SHE GOD PRESERVE YOU AND ALL YOUR FAMILY
AND AS TRUTH ALWAYS FORCES ITS WAY INTO RATIONAL MINDS SO THIS HONEST WORTHY GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SOME TINCTURE OF LEARNING AND VERY GOOD SENSE WAS IMMEDIATELY CONVINCED OF MY CANDOR AND VERACITY
AND I BADE HIM GO AS WELL AS I COULD
HE DETERMINED TO LEAVE HIS ASSES TO SAVE HIMSELF
SOME OF GULLIVER'S ADVENTURES BY JONATHAN SWIFT JUSTLY MAY I SAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE LIVED HAPPY ENOUGH IN THE COUNTRY IF MY LITTLENESS HAD NOT EXPOSED ME TO SEVERAL RIDICULOUS AND TROUBLESOME ACCIDENTS
AT THE NOISE OF THE FIRE I IMMEDIATELY ADVANCED WITH MY WHOLE ARMY WHICH WAS NOW EIGHT MEN VIZ MYSELF GENERALISSIMO
THEY DREW NEAR TO A VERY MIRY SLOUGH THAT WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE PLAIN
THE SILVER ONE HAD THIS:--"WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GET AS MUCH AS HE DESERVES
I TOOK PART OF A SMALL HOUSE IN THE OLD JEWRY
THOSE ARE PEARLS THAT WERE HIS EYES NOTHING OF HIM THAT DOTH FADE BUT DOTH SUFFER A SEA-CHANGE INTO SOMETHING RICH AND STRANGE
I LEFT FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS WITH MY WIFE AND FIXED HER IN A GOOD HOUSE AT REDRIFF
FOR THREE DAYS HE WANDERED ABOUT THE CITY EXCITING THE WONDER AND COMPASSION OF THE MULTITUDE BY ASKING EVERYBODY HE MET IF THEY HAD SEEN HIS PALACE OR COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING OF IT
THE BANK WAS HIGH AND RUGGED SO THAT I COULD SCARCELY HAVE GOT UP HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR SOME ROOTS OF TREES WHICH I FOUND WITHIN REACH
AND IT WAS REALLY IN ITS OWN NATURE MORE EASY FOR ME TO GUIDE IT OVER FORTY-FIVE MILES OF SEA THAN ABOUT FORTY-FIVE FATHOMS OF LAND WHERE IT LAY TO SET IT AFLOAT IN THE WATER
I GAVE THEM A DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY I MANAGED THE GOATS AND DIRECTIONS TO MILK AND FATTEN THEM AND TO MAKE BOTH BUTTER AND CHEESE
LET ITS MATERIALS BE MADE OF NOTHING LESS THAN PORPHYRY JASPER AGATE LAPIS-LAZULI AND THE FINEST MARBLE
THEY SPOKE TO ME BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
I KNOW WHAT I AM ASKING AND I KNOW IT HAS BEEN THE WILL OF GOD TO PRESERVE YOU IN STRANGE DANGERS AND THAT I SHALL BE THE MEANS TO SET YOU IN YOUR FATHER'S SEAT AGAIN
THESE MEN ASKED THE PILGRIMS WHENCE THEY CAME
THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY ARRIVED NEXT MORNING AND OPENED AN INQUIRY
IN THIS MEADOW THEY LAY DOWN AND SLEPT FOR HERE THEY MIGHT LIE DOWN SAFELY WHEN THEY AWOKE THEY GATHERED AGAIN OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND DRANK AGAIN OF THE WATER OF THE RIVER AND THEN LAY DOWN AGAIN TO SLEEP
I CRIED OUT IN AGONY BEAT MY HEAD AND BREAST AND THREW MYSELF UPON THE GROUND WHERE I LAY SOME TIME IN DESPAIR
IT WAS PLAIN TOO THAT HE HAD SOME OTHER MOTIVE FOR APPREHENDING HIM THAN MERELY THE DESIRE TO DO HIS DUTY AS A MAGISTRATE OF THE COUNTY WHICH HE HAD NOW BECOME
COOKS AND MENDICANTS STROLLING SOLDIERS FROM PALESTINE PEDLARS MECHANICS WANDERING PALMERS HEDGE-PRIESTS SAXON MINSTRELS AND WELSH BARDS TOGETHER WITH JESTERS AND JUGGLERS FORMED A MOTLEY AND HUNGRY GATHERING SUCH AS COULD ONLY BE SEEN ON THE OCCASION WHICH NOW BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER
THEY KNEW BESIDES THAT THE OUTLAWS WERE CHIEFLY PEASANTS AND YEOMEN OF SAXON DESCENT AND WERE GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO RESPECT THE PERSONS AND PROPERTY OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN
THE CAPTAIN OF MY SHIP KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE WHAT THEY MEANT SAID THEY WERE THE MALE AND FEMALE PARENTS OF THE ROC AND PRESSED US TO RE EMBARK WITH ALL SPEED TO PREVENT THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HE SAW WOULD OTHERWISE BEFALL US
I WAS GOING TO HOLLA AFTER THEM ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE WHEN I OBSERVED A HUGE CREATURE WALKING AFTER THEM IN THE SEA AS FAST AS HE COULD
BUT HOW IF THIS PATH SHOULD LEAD US OUT OF THE WAY
THE GENIE PROFESSED HIS OBEDIENCE TO THE OWNER OF THE LAMP AND DISAPPEARED
THESE HORRIBLE ANIMALS HAD THE BOLDNESS TO ATTACK ME ON BOTH SIDES AND ONE OF THEM HELD HIS FOREFEET AT MY COLLAR
BY HIS ACQUAINTANCE AMONG THE JEWELLERS HE CAME TO KNOW THAT THE FRUITS WHICH HE HAD GATHERED WHEN HE TOOK THE LAMP WERE INSTEAD OF COLORED GLASS STONES OF INESTIMABLE VALUE
SO HE WENT ON AND APOLLYON MET HIM
SO I WILL LEND YOU THE MONEY AND CHARGE YOU NO INTEREST
THE RING I CANNOT RESOLVE TO PART WITH
I HAVE NO MANNER OF USE FOR THEE--E'EN REMAIN WHERE THOU ART AND GO TO THE BOTTOM AS A CREATURE WHOSE LIFE IS NOT WORTH SAVING HOWEVER UPON SECOND THOUGHTS I TOOK IT AWAY
DID ANY OF THEM KNOW OF YOUR COMING
BUT HIS SECOND GIFT WHICH WAS MORE WONDERFUL STILL WAS HIS ABILITY TO WRITE DOWN ON PAPER WORDS THAT AS SOON AS WE READ THEM MAKE US FEEL JUST AS HE DID MAKE US SEE JUST THE PICTURES HE SAW
I WAS EXTREMELY GLAD TO BE THUS FREED FOR EVER FROM THIS TROUBLESOME FELLOW
FILLED WITH A SPIRIT OF GENEROSITY TO HIS RIVAL HE TOOK THE HAND OF ROWENA WHO STOOD BESIDE HIM AND WAS ABOUT TO PLACE IT IN THAT OF IVANHOE WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT WILFRED HAD VANISHED FROM THE ROOM
WHEN THE CAPTAIN WAS GONE I SENT FOR THE MEN UP TO ME TO MY APARTMENT AND ENTERED SERIOUSLY INTO DISCOURSE WITH THEM ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES
IN SHORT THERE WAS FRUIT OF ALL COLORS
THEY FLEW BACK IN THE DIRECTION THEY HAD COME AND DISAPPEARED FOR SOME TIME WHILE WE MADE ALL THE SAIL WE COULD TO ENDEAVOR TO PREVENT THAT WHICH UNHAPPILY BEFELL US
FOR THE THINGS WHICH ARE SEEN ARE TEMPORAL
SO I RESOLVED TO GO AS BEFORE WHEN THE TIDE WAS DOWN
AT LAST I RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE WILL OF GOD
WHEN DINNER WAS DONE MY MASTER WENT OUT TO HIS LABORERS AND AS I COULD DISCOVER BY HIS VOICE AND GESTURE GAVE HIS WIFE A STRICT CHARGE TO TAKE CARE OF ME
THE CAPTAIN AND HE WHO HAD VISITED THE TOWN IN THE MORNING AS SPY CAME IN THE LAST
CRAVEN KNIGHT
I WAS NOT HOWEVER SATISFIED WITH MY BANISHMENT
IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS OF EMILE WE READ
OBST
OBST
OBST
TO READ AND ENJOY THEM HAS BEEN FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES KNOWN TO ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLE A MIDSUMMER-NIGHTS DREAM RETOLD BY E
WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE COMES LAUGHING TO ME IN SIGN OF TRIUMPH AND BROUGHT ME THE SWORD AGAIN AND WITH ABUNDANCE OF GESTURES WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND LAID IT DOWN WITH THE HEAD OF THE SAVAGE THAT HE HAD KILLED JUST BEFORE ME
MANY COMBATANTS FALLING ON EITHER SIDE
WHERE I WAS I YET KNEW NOT
AND THEN CALLED OUT TO HIM IN THE BOAT TO YIELD OR HE WAS A DEAD MAN
THE WOLF DID NOT MIND ME IN THE LEAST BUT TOOK A LEAP OVER ME AND FALLING FURIOUSLY ON THE HORSE BEGAN INSTANTLY TO TEAR AND DEVOUR THE HIND PART OF THE POOR ANIMAL WHICH RAN THE FASTER FOR HIS PAIN AND TERROR
SOME WENT BEFORE SOME BEHIND AND SOME ON THE RIGHT HAND SOME ON THE LEFT AS TWERE TO GUARD THEM THROUGH THE UPPER REGIONS CONTINUALLY SOUNDING AS THEY WENT WITH MELODIOUS NOISE IN NOTES ON HIGH
YOU HAVE PROCURED ME INCREDIBLE WEALTH
AND AS I KNEW THAT THE FIRST STORM THAT BLEW MUST NECESSARILY BREAK HER ALL IN PIECES I RESOLVED TO SET ALL OTHER THINGS APART TILL I HAD GOT EVERYTHING OUT OF THE SHIP THAT I COULD GET
AND MY CONSCIENCE DID ACCUSE ME ON EVERY SIDE
WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE BOOKS HAVE LOST NOTHING OF THE CHARM AND FASCINATION WHICH THEY HAVE EVER POSSESSED FOR YOUNG AND OLD
BUT THERE WILL BE MANY A BLITHE EYE SEE IT THOUGH MINE BE CLOSED
AND I PLAINLY PROTESTED THAT I WOULD NEVER BE AN INSTRUMENT OF BRINGING A FREE AND BRAVE PEOPLE INTO SLAVERY
I CAN JUSTLY SAY THAT I WALKED UPON DIAMONDS WITHOUT FEELING ANY INCLINATION TO TOUCH THEM
AND AGAIN WISDOM IS GOOD WITH AN INHERITANCE I RESOLVED TO WALK IN MY FATHER'S WAYS AND I ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT WITH SOME MERCHANTS AND EMBARKED WITH THEM ON BOARD A SHIP WE HAD FITTED OUT IN PARTNERSHIP
THEN I SAW THE MAN THAT SAT UPON THE CLOUD OPEN THE BOOK AND BID THE WORLD DRAW NEAR
IN THE MEANTIME ALADDIN'S MOTHER REACHED HOME AND SHOWED IN HER AIR AND COUNTENANCE THE GOOD NEWS SHE BROUGHT HER SON
AND THE MORE HASTE HE MAKES TO COME AND RECEIVE THE PRINCESS MY DAUGHTER FROM MY HANDS THE GREATER PLEASURE HE WILL DO ME AS SOON AS ALADDIN'S MOTHER HAD RETIRED THE SULTAN PUT AN END TO THE AUDIENCE
LISTEN TO THESE HORRID SOUNDS FOR THE DIN OF THE RECOMMENCED ASSAULT AND DEFENCE NOW RUNG FEARFULLY LOUD FROM THE BATTLEMENTS OF THE CASTLE
ETERNITY
AND AS SHE HAD BADE THEM DO THE ASSAILANTS AT ONCE REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS TO BREAK IN THE POSTERN GATE
WHEREUPON SHE DREW HERSELF BACK AS IF SHE WERE MORE AFRAID OF ME
FAREWELL
AND I SLEPT AND DREAMED AGAIN AND SAW THE SAME TWO PILGRIMS GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE HIGH-WAY TOWARDS THE CITY
I WANT ALSO TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD IN TEN PURSES
HE INDUCED THE SULTAN TO SEND A DETACHMENT OF HIS GUARDS AND TO HAVE ALADDIN SEIZED AS A PRISONER OF STATE
THEY THAT WERE PERMITTED AND SHE ADDED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS HE'S DEAD NOW SOUNDS OF VOICES AT A DISTANCE WERE NOW HEARD
THE SMELL OF FIRE NOW COMMENCED TO REACH THE ROOM AND ON DINMONT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW HE EXCLAIMED
TO STATE THAT TO RELIEVE THE SICK AND WOUNDED OF ANOTHER RELIGION CANNOT BE DISPLEASING TO GOD WERE ALSO UNAVAILING
HE IS ATTENDED BY A GUARD OF ONE THOUSAND MEN CLAD IN CLOTH OF GOLD AND SILK AND MOUNTED ON ELEPHANTS RICHLY CAPARISONED
HOPING IN TIME TO SEE SOME SHIPS AT SEA AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO PLACE MYSELF AS NEAR THE COAST AS I COULD
AT SIX O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT A DRUNKEN POST-BOY REACHED THE VILLAGE WITH A LETTER FROM THE COLONEL CONTAINING INSTRUCTIONS TO BUY THE PROPERTY
IN THIS MANNER CASSIM'S MELANCHOLY DEATH WAS CONCEALED AND HUSHED UP BETWEEN ALI BABA HIS WIDOW AND MORGIANA HIS SLAVE WITH SO MUCH CONTRIVANCE THAT NOBODY IN THE CITY HAD THE LEAST KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICION OF THE CAUSE OF IT
HERE ALSO THEY HAD THE CITY ITSELF IN VIEW AND THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD ALL THE BELLS THEREIN RING TO WELCOME THEM THERETO
BUFFON
AFTER THAT BUSINESS WAS OVER I TOOK THE TOWER WHARF IN MY WAY BACK
FROM THESE ROVERS HOWEVER CEDRIC AND ATHELSTANE ACCOUNTED THEMSELVES SECURE AS THEY HAD IN ATTENDANCE TEN SERVANTS
AND THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WERE GOOD FOR MEDICINE
FOR MIRANDA WHO HAD NEVER SINCE SHE COULD FIRST REMEMBER SEEN ANY HUMAN BEING SAVE HER FATHER LOOKED ON THE YOUTHFUL PRINCE WITH REVERENCE IN HER EYES AND LOVE IN HER SECRET HEART
UPON THIS THE CAPTAIN PRETENDED TO HAVE NO POWER WITHOUT ME
WHEN THEY LEFT THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODY WITH THEM
ON HER WAY HOME SHE LAUGHED WITHIN HERSELF AT HER SON'S FOOLISH IMAGINATION
A BREACH IN ONE SINGLE PANE OF GLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATE DEATH
I WAS LORD OF THE WHOLE MANOR
WHENCE HAS HE ALL THIS WEALTH CASSIM HER HUSBAND WAS AT HIS COUNTING-HOUSE
THEY SUPPLIED ME AS THEY COULD SHOWING A THOUSAND MARKS OF WONDER AND ASTONISHMENT AT MY BULK AND APPETITE I THEN MADE ANOTHER SIGN THAT I WANTED DRINK
WHILE ORLANDO WAS FIGHTING THE LIONESS OLIVER WOKE TO SEE HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAD TREATED SO BADLY SAVING HIM FROM A WILD BEAST AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE
BUT MY THOUGHTS WERE SO INTENT UPON MY VOYAGE OVER THE SEA IN IT THAT I NEVER ONCE CONSIDERED HOW I SHOULD GET IT OFF THE LAND
SIR PHILIP MALVOISIN NEXT ADVANCED
I HATE HIS PERSON HIS LAWS AND PEOPLE
BUT AS HE HAD GIVEN THEM ALL QUARTER HE SUPPOSED HE WOULD SEND THEM ALL TO ENGLAND TO BE DEALT WITH THERE AS JUSTICE REQUIRED EXCEPT ATKINS WHOM HE WAS COMMANDED BY THE GOVERNOR TO ADVISE TO PREPARE FOR DEATH FOR THAT HE WOULD BE HANGED IN THE MORNING
IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT
I SMILED AT HIM AND LOOKED PLEASANTLY AND BECKONED TO HIM TO COME STILL NEARER
MATTERS WERE NOW VERY PLAIN TO ME
THIRD THE OTHER TWO THAT I HAD KEPT TILL NOW IN MY BOWER PINIONED BUT ON THE CAPTAIN'S MOTION HAD NOW RELEASED
YOU MUST REAP WHAT YOU HAVE SOWN EVEN THE FRUIT OF ALL YOUR PRAYERS AND TEARS AND SUFFERINGS FOR THE KING BY THE WAY
WHEN YOU HAVE THROWN AWAY THE WICK AND POURED OUT THE LIQUOR PUT IT IN YOUR WAISTBAND AND BRING IT TO ME
HE DENOUNCED REBECCA AS A WITCH BY WHOSE ENCHANTMENT BOIS-GUILBERT HAD BEEN LED TO OFFEND AGAINST THE RULES OF THE HOLY ORDER AND IN TONES OF PASSION AND SCORN HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO ISAAC'S PROTESTATIONS OF HER INNOCENCE
PRINCE JOHN NOW BEGAN TO TALK OF AWARDING THE PRIZE TO BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT WHO HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE THE BEST OF THE NORMAN KNIGHTS
TO-DAY WE LOVE WHAT TO-MORROW WE HATE
AND AS THEY APPROVED OF IT ORDERED THEM TO GO INTO THE VILLAGES ABOUT AND BUY NINETEEN MULES WITH THIRTY-EIGHT LARGE LEATHER JARS ONE FULL OF OIL AND THE OTHERS EMPTY
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF THEY WOULD HAVE COME NEARER US SO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE FIRED AT THEM OR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE GONE FARTHER OFF THAT WE MIGHT COME ABROAD
AND WHO AS I WAS A CREATURE THAT HAD OFFENDED HIM HAD LIKEWISE A JUDICIAL RIGHT TO CONDEMN ME TO WHAT PUNISHMENT HE THOUGHT FIT
AND WHAT WAS WORSE THAN ALL THIS I HAD NOT THAT RELIEF IN THIS TROUBLE THAT FROM THE RESIGNATION I USED TO PRACTISE I HOPED TO HAVE
BUT I PUT MY FINGERS IN MY EARS AND SO CAME ON MY WAY
THEN DID CHRISTIAN BEGIN TO BE AFRAID AND TO CAST IN HIS MIND WHETHER TO GO BACK OR TO STAND HIS GROUND
I PASS OVER MANY OTHER THINGS PECULIAR TO THIS ISLAND LEST I SHOULD WEARY YOU
SPEAK TO ME NO MORE
AND THE REST OF IT FIFTY GLUMGLUFFS AT MOST
THE PRINCE HIMSELF MADE MANY INQUIRIES OF THOSE IN HIS COMPANY ABOUT THE UNKNOWN STRANGER
ACCORDINGLY THE NEXT TIME I HAD THE HONOR TO SEE OUR EMPEROR I DESIRED HIS GENERAL LICENCE TO WAIT ON THE BLEFUSCUDIAN MONARCH WHICH HE WAS PLEASED TO GRANT ME AS I COULD PLAINLY PERCEIVE IN A VERY COLD MANNER
OR OF THE BARBAROUS CUSTOMS AND IDOLATRY OF SAVAGE PEOPLE WITH WHICH MOST WRITERS ABOUND
I WILL HAVE THE POUND OF FLESH WAS HIS REPLY
ROBINSON CRUSOE IS SHIPWRECKED BY DANIEL DEFOE HAVING LIVED ALMOST FOUR YEARS IN THE BRAZILS AND BEGINNING TO THRIVE AND PROSPER VERY WELL UPON MY PLANTATION I HAD NOT ONLY LEARNED THE LANGUAGE BUT HAD CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCE AND FRIENDSHIP AMONG MY FELLOW-PLANTERS AS WELL AS AMONG THE MERCHANTS AT ST SALVADOR WHICH WAS OUR PORT
I TOOK A LARGE ONE AND AFTER CLEANING IT PRESSED INTO IT SOME JUICE OF GRAPES WHICH ABOUNDED IN THE ISLAND
AND SUCH WAS THE SUPERIOR SKILL OR GOOD FORTUNE OF THE CHALLENGERS THAT THOSE OPPOSED TO BOIS-GUILBERT MALVOISIN AND FRONT-DE-BOEUF ROLLED ON THE GROUND
AND CROSSING THE CREEK OUT OF THEIR SIGHT WE SURPRISED THE TWO MEN BEFORE THEY WERE AWARE--ONE OF THEM LYING ON THE SHORE AND THE OTHER BEING IN THE BOAT
UPON THIS I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DESIRED IT I WOULD UNDERTAKE TO BRING THE TWO MEN HE SPOKE OF TO MAKE IT THEIR OWN REQUEST THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE THEM UPON THE ISLAND
ON ITS BEING OPENED COLONEL MANNERING INSTANTLY RECOGNISED HIS OWN WRITING ON THE PAPER IT ENCLOSED PROVING TO EVERYONE'S SATISFACTION THAT THE WEARER WAS THE REAL HEIR OF ELLANGOWAN
YOU MUST HELP ME YOU HAVE NO OCCASION FOR MY ASSISTANCE ANSWERED THE MAGICIAN
THEY HAD SEEN ME CUT THE CABLES AND THOUGHT MY DESIGN WAS ONLY TO LET THE SHIPS RUN ADRIFT OR FALL FOUL ON EACH OTHER
WE WAITED TILL DAY IN ORDER TO GET UPON THEM FOR WE HOPED IF THE GIANT DID NOT APPEAR BY SUNRISING AND GIVE OVER HIS HOWLING WHICH WE STILL HEARD THAT HE WOULD PROVE TO BE DEAD
I OWE THEREFORE MY LIFE TO YOU
AND THE PURSE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE INN WAS OPENED AND FOUND TO CONTAIN PROPERTY WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY STOLEN
THERE WAS ALSO THAT MET THEM WITH HARPS AND CROWNS AND GAVE THEM TO THEM THE HARPS TO PRAISE WITHAL AND THE CROWNS IN TOKEN OF HONOUR
THE MOST COVETOUS GRIPING MISER IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED OF THE VICE OF COVETOUSNESS IF HE HAD BEEN IN MY CASE
MY MISTRESS WAS GONE ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS AND HAD LOCKED ME IN
IF WE EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE WHO IN COMPARATIVELY RECENT DAYS HAVE STIRRED MEN WITH THE FORCE AND DIRECTNESS OF THEIR SIMPLE SPEECH AS LINCOLN FOR EXAMPLE WE FIND THAT AS BOYS THEY WERE GREAT READERS OF THE BIBLE AND ROBINSON CRUSOE GULLIVER'S TRAVELS SHAKESPEARE BUNYAN AND SCOTT
SOME OF THEM UPON HEARING ME TALK SO WILDLY THOUGHT I WAS MAD
BUT FOR HIM THOUGHT SHYLOCK I SHOULD BE RICHER BY HALF A MILLION DUCATS
BUT WAS SO CAUTIOUS AS TO STOP SOME TIME AT THE END OF THE FOREST THAT HE MIGHT NOT GO INTO THE TOWN BEFORE NIGHT
ON HEARING HIS ANSWER SHE DROPPED HIS HAND WITH A SIGH AND SAID
FOR BEING IN THE LATITUDE OF TWELVE DEGREES EIGHTEEN MINUTES A SECOND STORM CAME UPON US WHICH CARRIED US AWAY WITH THE SAME IMPETUOSITY WESTWARD AND DROVE US SO OUT OF THE WAY OF ALL HUMAN COMMERCE THAT HAD ALL OUR LIVES BEEN SAVED AS TO THE SEA WE WERE RATHER IN DANGER OF BEING DEVOURED BY SAVAGES THAN EVER RETURNING TO OUR OWN COUNTRY
WHAT HAVE I DONE UNCLE TO BE TREATED IN THIS SEVERE MANNER I AM YOUR UNCLE ANSWERED THE MAGICIAN
AND AFTER I HAD RELATED TO THEM ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME THE OLDEST AMONG THEM SAID THEY HAD SEVERAL TIMES HEARD OF THE GIANTS THAT DWELT IN THAT ISLAND THAT THEY WERE CANNIBALS
I OBSERVED THERE WAS THE FLESH OF SEVERAL ANIMALS BUT COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THEM BY THE TASTE
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH ONE AND THAT TOO THE LEAST OF THEM
AND MY HAIR WHICH WAS LONG AND THICK TIED DOWN IN THE SAME MANNER
I AM AS MUCH ALIVE AS HE CAN BE WHO HAS FED ON BREAD AND WATER FOR THREE DAYS
SUCH WONDERS COULD PROSPERO AND HIS SPIRITS PERFORM
BUT PREPARING THE TWELFTH TIME TO GO ON BOARD I FOUND THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE
ON TURNING ABOUT I WAS ALMOST PETRIFIED AS WHO WOULD NOT BE AT THE SIGHT OF A LION WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY APPROACHING WITH THE INTENTION OF SATISFYING HIS APPETITE WITH MY POOR CARCASS AND THAT WITHOUT ASKING MY CONSENT
HE TO WHOM I DEDICATE MY FUTURE LIFE WILL BE MY COMFORTER IF I DO HIS WILL
PORTIA WAS AS GRIEVED AS BASSANIO TO HEAR OF THE DANGER WHICH THREATENED HIS FRIEND
REFLECTING UPON ALL MY COMRADES THAT WERE DROWNED AND THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ONE SOUL SAVED BUT MYSELF
AS FOR FOOD I YET SAW NOT WHICH WAY TO SUPPLY MYSELF EXCEPT THAT I HAD SEEN TWO OR THREE CREATURES LIKE HARES RUN OUT OF THE WOOD WHERE I SHOT THE FOWL
THE GENIE THEN SHOWED HIM THE TREASURY WHICH WAS OPENED BY A TREASURER WHERE ALADDIN SAW LARGE VASES OF DIFFERENT SIZES PILED UP TO THE TOP WITH MONEY RANGED ALL ROUND THE CHAMBER
FAIR AND TRUE HE HIT THE NORMAN ON THE VISOR AND SADDLE HORSE AND MAN ROLLED ON THE GROUND UNDER A CLOUD OF DUST
CHRISTIAN PERCEIVING THAT MADE AT HIM AGAIN SAYING NAY IN ALL THESE THINGS WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH HIM THAT LOVED US AND WITH THAT APOLLYON SPREAD FORTH HIS DRAGON'S WINGS AND SPED HIM AWAY THAT CHRISTIAN FOR A SEASON SAW HIM NO MORE
I PARTOOK OF SOME PROVISIONS WHICH THEY OFFERED ME AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY DID IN SUCH A DESERT PLACE
THE FOLLOWING DAY HATTERAICK WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES AT KIPPLETRINGAN
NOW WAS CHRISTIAN SOMEWHAT IN A MAZE
ONE THING ONLY CAN SAVE THEE REBECCA
ALI BABA WHO EXPECTED A DARK DISMAL CAVERN WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A WELL-LIGHTED AND SPACIOUS CHAMBER WHICH RECEIVED THE LIGHT FROM AN OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE ROCK AND IN WHICH WERE ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS RICH BALES OF SILK STUFF BROCADE AND VALUABLE CARPETING PILED UPON ONE ANOTHER GOLD AND SILVER INGOTS IN GREAT HEAPS AND MONEY IN BAGS
THEY HAD NO SOONER TAKEN THIS RESOLUTION THAN THEY PUT IT IN EXECUTION
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE SULTAN ACCORDING TO CUSTOM WENT TO CONTEMPLATE AND ADMIRE ALADDIN'S PALACE HIS AMAZEMENT WAS UNBOUNDED TO FIND THAT IT COULD NOWHERE BE SEEN
THUS IN TWO YEARS TIME I HAD A THICK GROVE
THOUGH I STOOD AT THE FURTHER END OF THE TABLE ABOVE FIFTY FEET OFF
WHAT I PROMISED THEE WAS IN MY NON-AGE
ON REBELLION ON RAPINE ON MURDER WHO IS THERE
BUT TAKE CARE YOU DO NOT MEDDLE WITH THEM
HOWEVER I PUT MYSELF INTO THE SAME POSITION FOR AN ATTACK THAT I HAD FORMERLY PROVIDED AND WAS JUST READY FOR ACTION IF ANYTHING HAD PRESENTED
MY FATHER SAID IVANHOE PROSTRATING HIMSELF AT CEDRIC'S FEET GRANT ME THY FORGIVENESS THOU HAST IT MY SON SAID CEDRIC RAISING HIM UP
WHEN AT LENGTH THE ATTACK UPON THE CASTLE WAS COMMENCED ALL WAS AT ONCE BUSTLE AND CLAMOUR WITHIN ITS GLOOMY WALLS
IF THE PRINCESS CHOOSES SHE MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TRYING IF THIS OLD MAN IS SO SILLY AS TO GIVE A NEW LAMP FOR AN OLD ONE WITHOUT TAKING ANYTHING FOR THE EXCHANGE THE PRINCESS WHO KNEW NOT THE VALUE OF THIS LAMP AND THE INTEREST THAT ALADDIN HAD TO KEEP IT SAFE ENTERED INTO THE PLEASANTRY AND COMMANDED A SLAVE TO TAKE IT AND MAKE THE EXCHANGE
THE POOR DOMINIE NEVER CEASED TO BLAME HIMSELF FOR THE LOSS OF THE BOY AS HARRY WAS IN HIS CHARGE ON THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD DISAPPEARED
HE HAD ENGAGED WITH SOME FEW COMBATANTS AND HAD EASILY DEFEATED THEM DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE CONTEST BUT SEEMED TO TAKE NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE EVENT OF THE FIGHT ACTING THE PART RATHER OF A SPECTATOR THAN OF A PARTY IN THE TOURNAMENT
THAT HIS MEN CAME BACK IN FRIGHT SWEARING THEY HAD SEEN A SWIMMING HOUSE
I HAD NOT YET SEEN IT AND UPON THIS NOTICE OF AN INTENDED INVASION I AVOIDED APPEARING ON THAT SIDE OF THE COAST FOR FEAR OF BEING DISCOVERED BY SOME OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INTELLIGENCE OF ME ALL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO EMPIRES HAVING BEEN STRICTLY FORBIDDEN DURING THE WAR UPON PAIN OF DEATH AND AN EMBARGO LAID BY OUR EMPEROR UPON ALL VESSELS WHATSOEVER
YOU ARE SO LIKE HIM THEN HE GAVE ALADDIN A HANDFUL OF SMALL MONEY SAYING GO MY SON TO YOUR MOTHER GIVE MY LOVE TO HER AND TELL HER THAT I WILL VISIT HER TO-MORROW THAT I MAY SEE WHERE MY GOOD BROTHER LIVED SO LONG AND ENDED HIS DAYS ALADDIN RAN TO HIS MOTHER OVERJOYED AT THE MONEY HIS UNCLE HAD GIVEN HIM
HOW IS IT THEN THAT THOU ART SO QUICKLY TURNED ASIDE
OF SO LITTLE WEIGHT ARE THE GREATEST SERVICES TO PRINCES WHEN PUT INTO THE BALANCE WITH A REFUSAL TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS
FOR HE HAD GONE BUT A LITTLE WAY BEFORE HE ESPIED A FOUL FIEND COMING OVER THE FIELD TO MEET HIM
I SLEPT SOME HOURS BUT PERPETUALLY DISTURBED WITH DREAMS OF THE PLACE I HAD LEFT AND THE DANGERS I HAD ESCAPED
OUR HONOUR IS CONCERNED TO PUNISH THEM AND WE WILL FIND MEANS TO DO SO IN THE MEANTIME CEDRIC AND THE OTHER PRISONERS HAD BEEN HURRIED ALONG BY BOIS-GUILBERT AND DE BRACY AND SAFELY LODGED IN THE STRONG AND ANCIENT CASTLE OF REGINALD FRONT-DE-BOEUF
CHRISTIAN NIMBLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR HIS SWORD FROM THE ETCHING BY WILLIAM STRANG CHR
I REMEMBER BEFORE THE DWARF LEFT THE QUEEN HE FOLLOWED US ONE DAY INTO THOSE GARDENS AND MY NURSE HAVING SET ME DOWN HE AND I BEING CLOSE TOGETHER NEAR SOME DWARF APPLE-TREES I MUST NEEDS SHOW MY WIT BY A SILLY ALLUSION BETWEEN HIM AND THE TREES WHICH HAPPENS TO HOLD IN THEIR LANGUAGE AS IT DOES IN OURS
IT WAS AN OLD AND RUINOUS BUILDING
THAT SEEING ALMOST EVERY CONDITION THAT COULD BE WAS BETTER THAN THAT WHICH WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN WE OUGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE CONSEQUENCE WHETHER DEATH OR LIFE WOULD BE SURE TO BE A DELIVERANCE
IT IS TRUE BY THIS METHOD I COULD MAKE BUT ONE BOARD OUT OF A WHOLE TREE
I DID THEN AND DO NOW SUPPOSE THAT THE EAGLE WHICH FLEW AWAY WITH MY BOX WAS PURSUED BY TWO OR THREE OTHERS AND FORCED TO LET ME DROP WHILE HE DEFENDED HIMSELF AGAINST THE REST WHO HOPED TO SHARE IN THE PREY
SHE IS PERHAPS STILL WATCHING THE PARTRIDGES I HASTENED FULL OF HOPE AND JOY TO THE SPOT AND ACTUALLY THERE SHE WAS!--MY NOBLE DIANA--ON THE VERY PLACE WHERE I HAD LEFT HER A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
IN THE MEANTIME THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS REPAIRED TO THE PALACE AND WERE INTRODUCED INTO THE SULTAN'S PRESENCE WHERE THE CHIEF JEWELLER PRESENTED THE PRECIOUS STONES WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT BACK
I WAITED FOR MY WIFE WHO WAS FOLLOWING ME WITH MY LIEUTENANT AND A SERVANT
AND THEN IF THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE BOAT PERHAPS WE MIGHT FIND A WAY TO GET BETWEEN THEM AND THE SHORE AND SO MIGHT USE SOME STRATAGEM WITH THEM IN THE BOAT TO GET THEM ON SHORE
I GOT UP AS SOON AS I SAW THEM AND SALUTED THEM
ONE TURRET WAS NOW IN BRIGHT FLAMES WHICH FLASHED OUT FURIOUSLY FROM WINDOW AND SHOT-HOLE
WITHOUT LONG CONSIDERATION I TOOK ONE OF MY PISTOLS SHOT THE BRIDLE IN TWO BROUGHT DOWN THE HORSE AND PROCEEDED ON MY JOURNEY
AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE FIRST OF THE HOUSES WHICH MORGIANA HAD MARKED HE POINTED IT OUT
AND I HAD GRAPES ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE WINE OR TO HAVE CURED INTO RAISINS TO HAVE LOADED THAT FLEET WHEN IT HAD BEEN BUILT
ON THE OTHER HAND THE UNKNOWN CHAMPION HAD AIMED HIS SPEAR'S POINT AT THE HELMET OF HIS OPPONENT
AND SHORTLY AFTER HIS LITTLE DOG WASP WHICH HE HAD LEFT IN THE CARE OF DANDIE DINMONT AND DINMONT HIMSELF WERE SHOWN INTO HIS ROOM
THERE HAD BEEN SOME BARLEY AND WHEAT TOGETHER
THE GRACEFUL BEARING ELEGANT FORM AND WONDERFUL LIKENESS OF EACH SLAVE
AND BY ANOTHER OBSERVATION THAT HE WAS IN THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM OF CHINA
IT IS ALTOGETHER OUT OF HIS POWER AND I BELIEVE HE WILL NOT BE MUCH PLEASED WITH MY EMBASSY THIS TIME WHEN SHE CAME HOME FULL OF THESE THOUGHTS SHE TOLD ALADDIN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER INTERVIEW WITH THE SULTAN AND THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH HE CONSENTED TO THE MARRIAGE
THEN RUSHING AT ONCE UPON THE FOREMOST I KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH THE STOCK OF MY PIECE
BY THIS I PERCEIVE THOU ART ONE OF MY SUBJECTS FOR ALL THAT COUNTRY IS MINE AND I AM THE PRINCE AND GOD OF IT
THAT AS TO THEM I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY WHY I SHOULD NOT EXECUTE THEM AS PIRATES TAKEN IN THE FACT AS BY MY COMMISSION THEY COULD NOT DOUBT BUT I HAD AUTHORITY SO TO DO
SHE OFFERED BERTRAM AND DINMONT FOOD AND DRINK AND FEARING TO OFFEND HER THEY TOOK A LITTLE
BUT RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
I HAD TORTOISE OR TURTLE ENOUGH BUT NOW AND THEN ONE WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD PUT TO ANY USE
FOR MY INSATIABLE DESIRE OF SEEING FOREIGN COUNTRIES WOULD SUFFER ME TO CONTINUE NO LONGER
WHEREUPON I ROSE UP WITH AS MELANCHOLY A DISPOSITION AS EVER I HAD IN MY LIFE
HAVE YOU SEEN GLOSSIN HE SAID TO HER
AT FIRST I WAS TROUBLED WITH SEA-SICKNESS BUT SPEEDILY RECOVERED MY HEALTH
NESBIT PILGRIM'S PROGRESS CHRISTIAN STARTS ON HIS JOURNEY JOHN BUNYAN THE INTERPRETER SHOWS CHRISTIAN MANY EXCELLENT THINGS JOHN BUNYAN CHRISTIAN'S FIGHT WITH THE MONSTER APOLLYON JOHN BUNYAN CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL ARE CAPTIVES IN DOUBTING CASTLE JOHN BUNYAN CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL ARRIVE AT THE COELESTIAL CITY JOHN BUNYAN IVANHOE AND GUY MANNERING SIR WALTER SCOTT IVANHOE SIR EDWARD SULLIVAN GUY MANNERING SIR EDWARD SULLIVAN THE STARTLING ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN AN ADVENTURE WITH A LION AND A CROCODILE R
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN THIS HORRIBLE DILEMMA
ON EACH SIDE OF THE GATE WAS A SMALL WINDOW NOT ABOVE SIX INCHES FROM THE GROUND
FLIMNAP THE TREASURER IS ALLOWED TO CUT A CAPER ON THE STRAIT ROPE AT LEAST AN INCH HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER LORD IN THE WHOLE EMPIRE
COME COME SAID CELIA WRESTLE WITH THY AFFECTIONS OH ANSWERED ROSALIND THEY TAKE THE PART OF A BETTER WRESTLER THAN MYSELF
IT WAS SEVERAL HOURS AFTER FRIDAY CAME BACK TO ME BEFORE THEY CAME BACK TO THEIR BOAT
ISAAC I WOULD I HAD KNOWN OF THIS
HER EYES WERE LARGE LIVELY AND SPARKLING
AND THE TIDE BEING UP THE CAPTAIN HAD BROUGHT THE PINNACE IN NEAR THE PLACE WHERE I HAD FIRST LANDED MY RAFTS AND SO LANDED JUST AT MY DOOR
DIRECTLY HE SAW THE WONDERFUL FABRIC HE KNEW THAT NONE BUT THE GENIES THE SLAVES OF THE LAMP COULD HAVE PERFORMED SUCH WONDERS
AND WRAPPING ALL THIS IN A PIECE OF CANVAS I BEGAN TO THINK OF MAKING ANOTHER RAFT
I COULD ONLY LOOK UPWARDS THE SUN BEGAN TO GROW HOT AND THE LIGHT OFFENDED MY EYES
THE FARMER HAVING AS I SUPPOSE BY THEIR TALK RECEIVED SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF ME AS HIS SERVANT COULD GIVE HIM TOOK A PIECE OF A SMALL STRAW ABOUT THE SIZE OF A WALKING-STAFF AND THEREWITH LIFTED UP THE LAPPETS OF MY COAT WHICH IT SEEMS HE THOUGHT TO BE SOME KIND OF COVERING THAT NATURE HAD GIVEN ME
FOR THE NEGROES HAVING KILLED AND EATEN MY COMPANIONS SEEING ME TO BE WITHERED LEAN AND SICK DEFERRED MY DEATH
AS SOON AS I FOUND WATER ENOUGH--FOR MY RAFT DREW ABOUT A FOOT OF WATER--I THRUST HER UPON THAT FLAT PIECE OF GROUND AND THERE FASTENED OR MOORED HER BY STICKING MY TWO BROKEN OARS INTO THE GROUND ONE ON ONE SIDE NEAR ONE END AND ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE NEAR THE OTHER END
MY NAME IS ORLANDO AND I AM THE YOUNGEST SON OF SIR ROWLAND DE BOYS SAID THE YOUNG MAN
IT HAPPENED ONE DAY ABOUT NOON GOING TOWARDS MY BOAT I WAS EXCEEDINGLY SURPRISED WITH THE PRINT OF A MAN'S NAKED FOOT ON THE SHORE WHICH WAS VERY PLAIN TO BE SEEN ON THE SAND
AND THE IDEA AT ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD BUY THE PROPERTY HIMSELF AND BY DOING SO HELP THE LAIRD
THE KNIGHT BENT LOW AND KISSED THE HAND OF THE LOVELY SOVEREIGN BY WHOM HIS VALOUR HAD BEEN REWARDED
WHEN THE TROOP WAS ALL GOT TOGETHER THE CAPTAIN TOLD THEM THE REASON OF THEIR RETURNING
I ANSWERED THAT I WAS NO MECHANIC BUT A MERCHANT AND THAT THE PIRATES WHO SOLD ME HAD ROBBED ME OF ALL I POSSESSED
BUT THE SMUGGLER KNEW NOTHING OF HIM FROM THE TIME HE WENT THERE
AND IN ALL ABOUT FIVE OR SIX GALLONS OF RACK
BUT GIVE ME LEAVE TO SIT OPPOSITE TO IT THAT ALTHOUGH I SEE NOT THE MASTER OF A FAMILY SO DEAR TO ME I MAY AT LEAST BEHOLD THE PLACE WHERE HE USED TO SIT WHEN THE MAGICIAN HAD MADE CHOICE OF A PLACE AND SAT DOWN HE BEGAN TO ENTER INTO DISCOURSE WITH ALADDIN'S MOTHER
NOR DID HE FORGET TO TAKE WITH HIM THE WONDERFUL LAMP TO WHICH HE OWED ALL HIS GOOD-FORTUNE NOR TO WEAR THE RING WHICH WAS GIVEN HIM AS A TALISMAN
ALI BABA DID NOT WAIT FOR HIS SISTER-IN-LAW TO DESIRE HIM TO GO TO SEE WHAT WAS BECOME OF CASSIM BUT DEPARTED IMMEDIATELY WITH HIS THREE ASSES BEGGING OF HER FIRST TO MODERATE HER AFFLICTION
GUY MANNERING RETOLD BY SIR EDWARD SULLIVAN THE CASTLE OF ELLANGOWAN WAS AN OLD AND MASSIVE STRUCTURE SITUATED BY THE SEASHORE IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF SCOTLAND
AND AS FOR THE CAPTAIN HE COULD NOT CARRY THEM TO ENGLAND OTHER THAN AS PRISONERS IN IRONS TO BE TRIED FOR MUTINY AND RUNNING AWAY WITH THE SHIP
I WAS IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT AND KEPT AS FAR AS I COULD FROM THE EDGE FOR FEAR OF FALLING
BUT I MIGHT NOW RATHER CALL IT A WALL FOR I RAISED A KIND OF WALL UP AGAINST IT OF TURFS ABOUT TWO FEET THICK ON THE OUTSIDE
BEFORE LONG THE INMATES OF THE CASTLE HAD OTHER THINGS TO OCCUPY THEM
AND LATE AT NIGHT HE ARRIVED AT GODFREY BERTRAM'S HOUSE WHERE HE WAS HOSPITABLY WELCOMED BY THE OWNER
BY THE NEXT NIGHT THEY HAD EATEN ALL THE PROVISIONS THE GENIE HAD BROUGHT
IT DEPRIVES THEM OF THE USE OF THOSE MEANS WHICH REASON OFFERS FOR THEIR RELIEF
GIVE HIM THIS SCROLL AND HE WILL GIVE THEE EVERYTHING THAT CAN FURNISH THEE FORTH FOR THE TOURNAMENT
I REPROACHED MYSELF WITH MY LAZINESS THAT WOULD NOT SOW ANY MORE CORN ONE YEAR THAN WOULD JUST SERVE ME TILL THE NEXT SEASON AS IF NO ACCIDENT COULD INTERVENE TO PREVENT MY ENJOYING THE CROP THAT WAS UPON THE GROUND
AND IF I HAD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN WITH SUCH A VOICE AS MINE AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE AS FROM THE ROOM WHERE I LAY TO THE KITCHEN WHERE THE FAMILY KEPT
AFTER I HAD DRUNK IT I SAT DOWN UPON THE GROUND
WHEN THE SUN AROSE I WAS VERY FEEBLE
WHEN THE STONE WAS PULLED UP THERE APPEARED A STAIRCASE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP LEADING TO A DOOR
BUT THIS LAST WAS SO HEAVY I COULD NOT HOIST IT UP TO GET IT OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE
WHICH THE CHIEF OFFICER PERCEIVING TOLD HER IT WAS AN EASY MATTER TO BRING HER TO HER IF SHE DESIRED AND COMMANDED IT
PASSION OF THE MEN OF THIS WORLD
I TOLD THEM I THOUGHT THEY HAD MADE A RIGHT CHOICE
ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE I WAS SET AT LIBERTY AS I WAS ENTERTAINING THE COURT WITH THIS KIND OF FEATS THERE ARRIVED AN EXPRESS TO INFORM HIS MAJESTY THAT SOME OF HIS SUBJECTS RIDING NEAR THE PLACE WHERE I WAS FIRST TAKEN UP HAD SEEN A GREAT BLACK SUBSTANCE LYING ON THE GROUND VERY ODDLY SHAPED EXTENDING ITS EDGES ROUND AS WIDE AS HIS MAJESTY'S BED-CHAMBER AND RISING UP IN THE MIDDLE AS HIGH AS A MAN
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER OUR DEPARTURE WE WERE ATTACKED BY PIRATES WHO EASILY SEIZED UPON OUR SHIP BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A VESSEL OF WAR
ALADDIN GOT UP TREMBLING AND WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES SAID TO THE MAGICIAN
AND THE TIDE FAVORING ME I ADVANCED SO FAR THAT I COULD JUST HOLD UP MY CHIN AND FEEL THE GROUND
NO ONE HAD EVEN RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM
SO HE CALLED FOR THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WHO AFTER A LITTLE TIME CAME TO CHRISTIAN AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD HAVE
BUT HIS FATHER SNATCHED ME FROM HIM AND AT THE SAME TIME GAVE HIM SUCH A BOX ON THE LEFT EAR AS WOULD HAVE FELLED AN EUROPEAN TROOP OF HORSE TO THE EARTH ORDERING HIM TO BE TAKEN FROM THE TABLE
I SPIT AT THEE AND I DEFY THEE
A LITTLE TIME AFTER THIS AUDIENCE I SOLICITED LEAVE TO DEPART AND WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY OBTAINED IT
THE BLEFUSCUDIANS WHO HAD NOT THE LEAST IMAGINATION OF WHAT I INTENDED WERE AT FIRST CONFOUNDED WITH ASTONISHMENT
I AFTERWARD WENT TO A SMITH WHO MADE ME A BIT ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN I SHOWED HIM AND ALSO SOME STIRRUPS
THE JEWESS INSTANTLY REMEMBERED THE SLIP OF PAPER WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO HOLD IN HER HAND AND LOOKING AT IT WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED SHE READ THE WORDS DEMAND A CHAMPION REBECCA SAID THE GRAND MASTER WHO BELIEVED THE WORDS OF BOIS GUILBERT HAD REFERENCE TO SOME OTHER WRITING HAST THOU AUGHT ELSE TO SAY THERE IS YET ONE CHANCE OF LIFE LEFT TO ME SAID THE JEWESS EVEN BY YOUR OWN FIERCE LAWS
I TOOK ALL POSSIBLE METHODS TO CULTIVATE THIS FAVORABLE DISPOSITION
THE NAME OF THE ELDEST WAS PASSION AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER PATIENCE
NOW BROWN WHEN HE FOUND THAT JULIA MANNERING HAD GONE TO WOODBOURNE DETERMINED TO FOLLOW HER WITH THE PURPOSE OF RESUMING HIS ADDRESSES AND HE ACCORDINGLY SET OUT ON FOOT TOWARDS THE NORTH
CEDRIC AND ATHELSTANE WERE CONFINED IN ONE APARTMENT THE LADY ROWENA IN ANOTHER WHILE THE POOR JEW WAS HASTILY THRUST INTO A DUNGEON-VAULT THE FLOOR OF WHICH WAS DEEP BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND AND HIS DAUGHTER REBECCA WAS LOCKED INTO A CELL IN A DISTANT AND SEQUESTERED TURRET
AND NO SOONER WERE THEY ALONE THAN THEIR BED WAS REMOVED IN THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MANNER AS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
THE SECOND VOYAGE I DESIGNED AFTER MY FIRST VOYAGE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS AT BAGDAD BUT IT WAS NOT LONG ERE I GREW WEARY OF AN INDOLENT LIFE AND I PUT TO SEA A SECOND TIME WITH MERCHANTS OF KNOWN PROBITY
WHERE SAID SHE CAN HE GET SO MANY LARGE GOLD TRAYS AND SUCH PRECIOUS STONES TO FILL THEM
SHALL WE BE RULED BY THE GIANT
HE HAS WISHED TO SURPRISE US AND LET US SEE WHAT WONDERS CAN BE DONE IN ONLY ONE NIGHT ALADDIN ON HIS BEING CONVEYED BY THE GENIE TO HIS OWN HOME REQUESTED HIS MOTHER TO GO TO THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR AND TELL HER THAT THE PALACE WOULD BE READY FOR HER RECEPTION IN THE EVENING
THEY DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION EVEN MORE THAN THOSE OF THE FIRST UPON WHICH EVERY ONE HELD HIS PEACE AND SINDBAD PROCEEDED
AND OBSERVING LIKEWISE THAT THE NUMBER OF MY ENEMIES INCREASED I GAVE TOKENS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY MIGHT DO WITH ME WHAT THEY PLEASED
A FOURTH COMBAT FOLLOWED
MEANWHILE I HAD MUCH LIBERTY SO THAT SCARCELY ANY NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF WHAT I DID AND THIS GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY ONE DAY TO GET AT A DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSES AND TO MAKE MY ESCAPE
AND BEHOLD AT THE DOOR STOOD A GREAT COMPANY OF MEN AS DESIROUS TO GO IN BUT DURST NOT
HE WAS NO DOUBT DOING AS THE LAW DIRECTED HIM BUT AS FAR AS CONCERNED THE INHABITANTS OF DERNCLEUGH HE WAS ACTING WITH GREAT HARSHNESS FOR MEG MERRILIES HAD ALL ALONG SHOWN A STRONG AFFECTION FOR HIS BOY LITTLE HARRY BERTRAM
SOMETIMES I WENT OUT IN HER TO DIVERT MYSELF BUT NO MORE HAZARDOUS VOYAGES WOULD I GO SCARCELY EVER ABOVE A STONE'S CAST OR TWO FROM THE SHORE I WAS SO APPREHENSIVE OF BEING HURRIED OUT OF MY KNOWLEDGE AGAIN BY THE CURRENTS OR WINDS OR ANY OTHER ACCIDENT
AND INTO WHICH THE SERVANT WHO USED TO CARRY ME ON HORSEBACK WOULD PUT A LEATHERN BELT AND BUCKLE IT ABOUT HIS WAIST
AFTER I HAD SATISFIED HIM HE ORDERED THAT I SHOULD WANT FOR NOTHING
FROM THE ISLE OF SALABAT WE WENT TO ANOTHER WHERE I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH CLOVES CINNAMON AND OTHER SPICES
NOW WHEN NIGHT WAS COME AND WHEN MRS DIFFIDENCE AND HER HUSBAND THE GIANT WERE GOT TO BED THEY BEGAN TO RENEW THEIR DISCOURSE OF THEIR PRISONERS
THEY CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY AT GREAT SPEED
FOR MY OWN PART I SWAM AS FORTUNE DIRECTED ME AND WAS PUSHED FORWARD BY WIND AND TIDE
AND THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE AFFORDED SIMILAR TESTIMONIES OF HER EXTREME PLEASURE
NOW WHILE I WAS GAZING UPON ALL THESE THINGS I TURNED MY HEAD TO LOOK BACK AND SAW IGNORANCE COME UP TO THE RIVER-SIDE
THEY WERE TO RETURN HOME ON THE MORROW AND HAD I BEEN ONE DAY LATER I MUST HAVE PERISHED BECAUSE THE INHABITED PART OF THE ISLAND WAS A GREAT DISTANCE OFF AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO HAVE REACHED IT WITHOUT A GUIDE
AND ALL THE REST BEGGED OF HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SENT TO ENGLAND
MERE OUTWARD SHOW HE SAID IS TO BE DESPISED
NO REPLIED MEG MERRILIES
SOMETIMES SHE PRESENTED THE PONIARD TO ONE BREAST SOMETIMES TO ANOTHER AND OFTENTIMES SEEMED TO STRIKE HER OWN
BUT A SLAVE HAVING OPENED THE DOOR ALI BABA'S SON TOOK HIM OBLIGINGLY BY THE HAND AND IN A MANNER FORCED HIM IN
I BELIEVED HIM REALLY TO STAND IN NEED OF MY ASSISTANCE TOOK HIM UPON MY BACK AND HAVING CARRIED HIM OVER BADE HIM GET DOWN AND FOR THAT END STOOPED THAT HE MIGHT GET OFF WITH EASE
RIDING STRAIGHT UP TO BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT HE STRUCK WITH THE SHARP END OF HIS SPEAR THE SHIELD OF THE VICTORIOUS NORMAN UNTIL IT RANG AGAIN
BABA MUSTAPHA SAID SHE YOU MUST MAKE HASTE AND SEW THE PARTS OF THIS BODY TOGETHER
I THEN FASTENED MY HANDKERCHIEF TO A STICK I USUALLY CARRIED AND THRUSTING IT UP THE HOLE WAVED IT SEVERAL TIMES IN THE AIR THAT IF ANY BOAT OR SHIP WAS NEAR THE SEAMEN MIGHT CONJECTURE SOME UNHAPPY MORTAL TO BE SHUT UP IN THE BOX
AND BEING EXCESSIVELY FATIGUED I FELL FAST ASLEEP AND SLEPT AS COMFORTABLY AS I BELIEVE FEW COULD HAVE DONE IN MY CONDITION AND FOUND MYSELF MORE REFRESHED WITH IT THAN I THINK I EVER WAS ON SUCH AN OCCASION
HIS UPPER LIP HUNG DOWN UPON HIS BREAST
IT WAS THEREFORE LIKELY TO BE DISPOSED OF VERY CHEAP AS NO ONE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT YOUNG BERTRAM WAS DEAD
THEN SAID HOPEFUL THAT'S GOOD NEWS
HOWEVER WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT I GOT MOST OF THE PIECES OF THE CABLE ASHORE AND SOME OF THE IRON THOUGH WITH INFINITE LABOR
ALI BABA DID SO AND SEEING A MAN STARTED BACK IN ALARM AND CRIED OUT
WELL ON SATURDAY ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY BEGAN TO PRAY AND CONTINUED IN PRAYER TILL ALMOST BREAK OF DAY
BUT THE THING WAS HUSHED UP AND NEVER KNOWN AT COURT FOR THE GIRL WAS AFRAID OF THE QUEEN'S ANGER
GOVERNOR AND PRESENTLY I KNEW THE CAPTAIN'S VOICE
REMEMBER TOO THAT HE WOULD EAT NO SALT WITH YOU
THEN SUDDENLY ALL HIS HAPPINESS WAS DASHED WITH SORROW FOR MESSENGERS CAME FROM VENICE TO TELL HIM THAT ANTONIO WAS RUINED AND THAT SHYLOCK DEMANDED FROM THE DUKE OF VENICE THE FULFILMENT OF THE BOND UNDER WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED TO A POUND OF THE MERCHANT'S FLESH
OUR STRENGTH WAS NOW THUS ORDERED FOR THE EXPEDITION
A LARGE BAGFUL OF SMALL SHOT AND A GREAT ROLL OF SHEET LEAD
I COMMUNICATED TO HIS MAJESTY A PROJECT I HAD FORMED OF SEIZING THE ENEMY'S WHOLE FLEET
THESE THREADS ARE PROPOSED AS PRIZES FOR THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE EMPEROR HATH A MIND TO DISTINGUISH BY A PECULIAR MARK OF HIS FAVOR
AS THE HOUR APPROACHED WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE THE FATE OF THE UNFORTUNATE JEWESS A VAST MULTITUDE HAD GATHERED TO WITNESS A SPECTACLE EVEN IN THAT AGE BUT SELDOM SEEN
AND AFTER HAVING PUT ONE OF HIS MEN INTO EACH WITH THE WEAPONS WHICH HE THOUGHT FIT LEAVING OPEN THE SEAM WHICH HAD BEEN UNDONE TO LEAVE THEM ROOM TO BREATHE HE RUBBED THE JARS ON THE OUTSIDE WITH OIL FROM THE FULL VESSEL
REVENGE HENCEFORTH SHALL POSSESS ME WHOLLY AND THOU THYSELF SHALT SAY THAT WHATEVER WAS THE LIFE OF ULRICA HER DEATH WELL BECAME THE DAUGHTER OF THE NOBLE TORQUIL
WE HOLD OUR BREATHS AS HE RIDES FULL-TILT AT THE NORMAN KNIGHT AND STRIKES HIM FULL ON THE VISOR OF HIS HELMET THROWING HORSE AND RIDER TO THE GROUND
THEY ALSO ASKED THEM WHERE THEY HAD LODGED WHAT DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS WHAT COMFORTS AND PLEASURES THEY HAD MET IN THE WAY
IF YOU LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS IMMEDIATELY AND SUBMIT YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR LIVES ALL BUT WILL ATKINS UPON THIS WILL ATKINS CRIED OUT FOR GOD'S SAKE CAPTAIN GIVE ME QUARTER
BOTH I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE RING ALADDIN AGREEABLY SURPRISED AT AN OFFER OF HELP SO LITTLE EXPECTED REPLIED GENIE SHOW ME WHERE THE PALACE I CAUSED TO BE BUILT NOW STANDS OR TRANSPORT IT BACK WHERE IT FIRST STOOD YOUR COMMAND ANSWERED THE GENIE IS NOT WHOLLY IN MY POWER
GOD HATH DENIED ME REPENTANCE
THE NEGROES PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING
YEA AND TO PARDON ALSO WHAT I DID AS TO MY COMPLIANCE WITH THEE
HOWEVER THOUGH I COULD HAVE NO IDEA OF KILLING SUCH AN ANIMAL WITH THAT WEAK KIND OF AMMUNITION YET I HAD SOME HOPES OF FRIGHTENING HIM BY THE REPORT AND PERHAPS OF WOUNDING HIM ALSO
THEN APOLLYON STRADDLED QUITE OVER THE WHOLE BREADTH OF THE WAY AND SAID I AM VOID OF FEAR IN THIS MATTER
NOT LONG AFTER THE GRACE-CUP WAS SERVED ROUND AND THE GUESTS AFTER MAKING DEEP OBEISANCE TO THEIR LANDLORD AND THE LADY ROWENA AROSE AND RETIRED WITH THEIR ATTENDANTS FOR THE NIGHT
WHEN I CAME TO MY OWN HOUSE FOR WHICH I WAS FORCED TO INQUIRE ONE OF MY SERVANTS OPENING THE DOOR I BENT DOWN TO GO IN LIKE A GOOSE UNDER A GATE FOR FEAR OF STRIKING MY HEAD
ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED
REMEMBEREST THOU THE MAGAZINE OF FUEL THAT IS STORED BENEATH THESE APARTMENTS WOMAN EXCLAIMED THE WOUNDED MAN WITH FURY THOU HAST NOT SET FIRE TO IT
WHAT MARKS WERE THERE OF ANY OTHER FOOTSTEP
IF YE SHOULD CHANCE TO BE HARD BESTEAD IN ANY FOREST BETWEEN TRENT AND TEES WIND THREE NOTES UPON IT AND YE SHALL FIND HELPERS AND RESCUE GRAMERCY FOR THE GIFT BOLD YEOMAN SAID THE KNIGHT
THE SHIP LAY VERY BROAD OFF SO WE THOUGHT IT BETTER SPOONING BEFORE THE SEA THAN TRYING OR HULLING
THE WEATHER HAD NOW CLEARED
I WAS OBLIGED TO CARRY HER BACK TO THE HOUSE ON MY HORSE WHERE REST FEEDING AND GREAT CARE SOON RESTORED HER TO HEALTH
I MIGHT CALL HIM SHE SAID A THING DIVINE FOR NOTHING NATURAL I EVER SAW SO NOBLE AND FERDINAND BEHOLDING HER BEAUTY WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT EXCLAIMED MOST SURE THE GODDESS ON WHOM THESE AIRS ATTEND NOR DID HE ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE PASSION WHICH SHE INSPIRED IN HIM FOR SCARCELY HAD THEY EXCHANGED HALF A DOZEN SENTENCES BEFORE HE VOWED TO MAKE HER HIS QUEEN IF SHE WERE WILLING
AND I DO NOT WONDER NOW AT THAT CUSTOM WHEN A MALEFACTOR WHO HAS THE HALTER ABOUT HIS NECK IS TIED UP AND JUST GOING TO BE TURNED OFF AND HAS A REPRIEVE BROUGHT TO HIM--I SAY I DO NOT WONDER THAT THEY BRING A SURGEON WITH IT TO LET HIM BLEED THAT VERY MOMENT THEY TELL HIM OF IT THAT THE SURPRISE MAY NOT DRIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS FROM THE HEART AND OVERWHELM HIM FOR SUDDEN JOYS LIKE GRIEFS CONFOUND AT FIRST
CONSIDER AGAIN WHEN THOU ART IN COOL BLOOD WHAT THOU ART LIKE TO MEET WITH IN THE WAY THAT THOU GOEST
WE PASSED BY SEVERAL ISLANDS AND AMONG OTHERS THAT CALLED THE ISLE OF BELLS ABOUT TEN DAYS SAIL FROM SERENDIB WITH A REGULAR WIND AND SIX FROM THAT OF KELA WHERE WE LANDED
NEXT HIS HORSE
THE SHIP SET SAIL AND AFTER A VERY SUCCESSFUL NAVIGATION WE LANDED AT BUSSORAH AND FROM THENCE I WENT TO THE CITY OF BAGDAD WHERE THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO ACQUIT MYSELF OF MY COMMISSION
I RESOLVED TO FALL TO WORK WITH THESE AND I FLUNG AS MANY OF THEM OVERBOARD AS I COULD MANAGE FOR THEIR WEIGHT TYING EVERY ONE WITH A ROPE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT DRIVE AWAY
FOR IT IS TIME FOR YOUR HEALTH THAT YOU HAD YOUR BROTH AFTER YOUR BATHING MORGIANA THEN TOLD HIM ALL SHE HAD DONE FROM THE FIRST OBSERVING THE MARK UPON THE HOUSE TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ROBBERS AND THE FLIGHT OF THEIR CAPTAIN
ALADDIN RETURNED HOME IN THE ORDER HE HAD COME AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WISHED HIM ALL HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY
NOW THE WAY FROM THE RIVER WAS ROUGH AND THEIR FEET TENDER BY REASON OF THEIR TRAVELS
I SINNED AGAINST THE LIGHT OF THE WORD AND THE GOODNESS OF GOD
BUT MY DEAR LITTLE NURSE PICKED IT OUT OF MY MOUTH WITH A SMALL NEEDLE AND THEN I FELL A-VOMITING WHICH GAVE ME GREAT RELIEF
JACK SHALL HAVE JILL
YET HE STOOD STILL BECAUSE AS I PERCEIVED HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAY TO GO
THEN AT LAST CAME BASSANIO AND PORTIA WOULD HAVE DELAYED HIM FROM MAKING HIS CHOICE FROM VERY FEAR OF HIS CHOOSING WRONG
I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP HEAR ME SAID ALADDIN
HE DESIRED TO KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE UPON SUCH AN OCCASION IN MY OWN COUNTRY
FOR KNOWING NOTHING OF THE COAST MY RAFT RAN AGROUND AT ONE END OF IT UPON A SHOAL AND NOT BEING AGROUND AT THE OTHER END IT WANTED BUT A LITTLE THAT ALL MY CARGO HAD SLIPPED OFF TOWARDS THE END THAT WAS AFLOAT AND SO FALLEN INTO THE WATER
WHEN THEIR TREATY WAS FINISHED WHEREIN I DID THEM SEVERAL GOOD OFFICES BY THE CREDIT I NOW HAD OR AT LEAST APPEARED TO HAVE AT COURT THEIR EXCELLENCIES WHO WERE PRIVATELY TOLD HOW MUCH I HAD BEEN THEIR FRIEND MADE ME A VISIT IN FORM
AT THE SAME TIME HE CALLED TO A SLAVE AND ORDERED HIM WHEN THE MULES WERE UNLOADED TO PUT THEM INTO THE STABLE AND TO FEED THEM
THE SAILORS WERE ALL AMAZEMENT AND ASKED ME A THOUSAND QUESTIONS WHICH I HAD NO INCLINATION TO ANSWER I WAS EQUALLY CONFOUNDED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MANY PYGMIES FOR SUCH I TOOK THEM TO BE AFTER HAVING SO LONG ACCUSTOMED MINE EYES TO THE MONSTROUS OBJECTS I HAD LEFT
ONE MORNING AS ORLANDO WAS GOING TO VISIT GANYMEDE HE SAW A MAN ASLEEP ON THE GROUND AND THAT THERE WAS A LIONESS CROUCHING NEAR WAITING FOR THE MAN WHO WAS ASLEEP TO WAKE
WHAT BECAME OF MY COMPANIONS IN THE BOAT AS WELL AS OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED ON THE ROCK OR WERE LEFT IN THE VESSEL I CANNOT TELL
NOW YOU MUST NOTE THAT THE CITY STOOD UPON A MIGHTY HILL BUT THE PILGRIMS WENT UP THAT HILL WITH EASE BECAUSE THEY HAD THESE TWO MEN TO LEAD THEM UP BY THE ARMS
BUT THE WHOLE SCENE OF THIS VOYAGE MADE SO STRONG AN IMPRESSION ON MY MIND AND IS SO DEEPLY FIXED IN MY MEMORY THAT IN COMMITTING IT TO PAPER I DID NOT OMIT ONE MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE
BUT SO BRUISED FROM HEAD TO FOOT THAT I COULD NOT GO ABROAD IN TEN DAYS
HARRY BERTRAM LOOK AT ME
FOR THEY ARE SO TIMOROUS THAT THEY WILL FLY UPON THE RATTLING OF TWO STICKS OR BOARDS
THE FIRST THING I PROPOSED TO MYSELF WAS TO THROW DOWN MY ENCLOSURES AND TURN ALL MY TAME CATTLE WILD INTO THE WOODS LEST THE ENEMY SHOULD FIND THEM AND THEN FREQUENT THE ISLAND IN PROSPECT OF THE SAME OR THE LIKE BOOTY
BUT DEEP IN HIS HEART HE CHERISHED A DESIRE FOR REVENGE ON THE RICH SMUG MERCHANT
BUT THAT PERMISSION WOULD BE GIVEN TO A MAN OF RELIGION TO COME TO RECEIVE THEIR DYING CONFESSION AS IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED TO EXECUTE THEM BEFORE NOON
IN THE MEANTIME FRIDAY AND THE CAPTAIN'S MATE SO WELL MANAGED THEIR BUSINESS WITH THE REST THAT THEY DREW THEM BY HALLOOING AND ANSWERING FROM ONE HILL TO ANOTHER AND FROM ONE WOOD TO ANOTHER TILL THEY NOT ONLY HEARTILY TIRED THEM BUT LEFT THEM WHERE THEY WERE VERY SURE THEY COULD NOT REACH BACK TO THE BOAT BEFORE IT WAS DARK
RASPE THE BARON'S WONDERFUL DOG R
WE SEND YOU THIS LETTER AS FROM ONE BROTHER TO ANOTHER
I FREQUENTED ALSO THE SOCIETY OF THE LEARNED INDIANS AND TOOK DELIGHT TO HEAR THEM CONVERSE
I ALSO PARTOOK OF IT BUT VERY SPARINGLY
AT LAST WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF HE SAID AND WHAT IS BECOME OF THE MERCHANT MERCHANT ANSWERED SHE
HE HAD BEEN TAKEN TO HOLLAND HATTERAICK SAID AND LEFT WITH AN OLD MERCHANT NAMED VANBEEST BROWN WHO TOOK A FANCY TO THE BOY AND CALLED HIM BY HIS OWN NAME
THUS THEY DID SEVERAL DAYS AND NIGHTS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPOSED TO GO ON THEY EAT AND DRANK AND DEPARTED
BUT COMING A LITTLE TO HIMSELF AGAIN THEY RENEWED THEIR DISCOURSE ABOUT THE GIANT'S COUNSEL AND WHETHER YET THEY HAD BEST TO TAKE IT OR NO
WHEN IT WAS EVENING SINDBAD SENT FOR A PURSE OF 100 SEQUINS AND GIVING IT TO THE PORTER SAID TAKE THIS HINDBAD RETURN TO YOUR HOME AND COME BACK TO-MORROW TO HEAR MORE OF MY ADVENTURES THE PORTER WENT AWAY ASTONISHED AT THE HONOR DONE HIM AND THE PRESENT MADE HIM
NOW I WANTED NOTHING BUT A BOAT TO FURNISH MYSELF WITH MANY THINGS WHICH I FORESAW WOULD BE VERY NECESSARY TO ME
HE WILL BE A LUCKY LAD IF HE LIVES THROUGH IT HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK TO THE GIPSY WHEN HE HEARD A HOARSE VOICE CALLING TO HER IN ANGRY TONES FROM OUTSIDE AND IN A MOMENT AFTER A MAN WHO WAS APPARENTLY A SEA-CAPTAIN CAME IN TO WHERE MEG MERRILIES WAS SEATED
ONLY THAT I WAS FAIN TO CUT THEM IN PIECES AND BRING AS MUCH AT A TIME AS I COULD FOR THEY WERE NO MORE USEFUL TO BE SAILS BUT AS MERE CANVAS ONLY
DUKE FREDERICK WAS PLEASED WITH HIS COURAGE AND ASKED HIS NAME
BUT LAST GIVES PLACE TO NOTHING
DEMETRIUS THOUGHT OF NO ONE BUT HELENA AND HELENA HAD NEVER HAD ANY THOUGHT OF ANYONE BUT DEMETRIUS
THIS IT SEEMS WAS IN TOKEN OF SWEARING TO BE MY SLAVE FOREVER
BY THIS MEANS MORGIANA FOUND THAT HER MASTER ALI BABA HAD ADMITTED THIRTY-EIGHT ROBBERS INTO HIS HOUSE AND THAT THIS PRETENDED OIL MERCHANT WAS THEIR CAPTAIN
HOWEVER I KEPT MY STATION AND MY SPIRITS BEGAN TO RECOVER WHEN I FOUND THAT THERE WAS NOT ABOVE THREE MEN THAT FOLLOWED HIM
FOR SUPPOSING THESE PEOPLE HAD ENDEAVORED TO KILL ME WITH THEIR SPEARS AND ARROWS WHILE I WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE AWAKED WITH THE FIRST SENSE OF SMART WHICH MIGHT SO FAR HAVE ROUSED MY RAGE AND STRENGTH AS TO HAVE ENABLED ME TO BREAK THE STRINGS WHEREWITH I WAS TIED
DINMONT THEN TOOK HIS FRIEND UPON HIS PONY AND THEY SUCCEEDED AFTER SOME TIME IN REACHING CHARLIE'S HOPE THE FARMER'S HOME WHERE THEY WERE WELCOMED BY HIS WIFE AND A LARGE TROOP OF CHILDREN
ANY KNIGHT MIGHT SELECT ANY ANTAGONIST FOR COMBAT BY TOUCHING HIS SHIELD
I HAD THE LIVES OF ALL MY SUBJECTS AT MY ABSOLUTE COMMAND
TO WHOM IT WAS ANSWERED YOU MUST THERE RECEIVE THE COMFORT OF ALL YOUR TOIL AND HAVE JOY FOR ALL YOUR SORROW
BUT HOW TO GET HER OFF INTO THE SEA WAS A DOUBTFUL THING
OBERON AND TITANIA LOVED EACH OTHER MORE THAN EVER
SO SHALT THOU SEE THE GATE
AND SO CONTRIVED TO MAINTAIN HIS ANCIENT STATE IN HIS MANSION AT ROTHERWOOD WHILE MANY OTHERS IN A SIMILAR SITUATION HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO GIVE UP THEIR HOMES AND PROPERTIES TO THE SUPPORTERS OF THE NORMAN INVADER
HERE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ADVANCE A STEP
AND THE SMUGGLER RECOGNISING HIS VOICE TOLD HIM WITH A CURSE TO BEGONE
WHEREFORE HE WITHDREW AND LEFT THEM AS BEFORE TO CONSIDER WHAT TO DO
THE SHIP WAS SAFE IN THE HARBOR AND NEXT DAY THEY ALL SET SAIL FOR NAPLES WHERE FERDINAND AND MIRANDA WERE TO BE MARRIED
THE CEREMONIES AT MY DEPARTURE WERE TOO MANY TO TROUBLE THE READER WITH AT THIS TIME
IS THERE HOPES
AND AS I RECKON ABOUT TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE
I FELL INTO A LANGUISHING DISTEMPER WHICH PROVED MY SAFETY
AND WHENCE HE CAME
AS SOON AS ABDALLA SAW THAT ALI BABA AND COGIA HOUSSAIN HAD DONE TALKING HE BEGAN TO PLAY ON THE TABOR AND ACCOMPANIED IT WITH AN AIR TO WHICH MORGIANA WHO WAS AN EXCELLENT PERFORMER DANCED IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD HAVE CREATED ADMIRATION IN ANY COMPANY
AND RALPH DE VIPONT SUMMED UP THE LIST OF THE STRANGER'S TRIUMPHS BEING HURLED TO THE GROUND WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HE WAS BORNE SENSELESS FROM THE LISTS
BUT MY OPINION IS IF IT CAN BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE THAT IF A ROC'S EGG WERE HUNG UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOME THIS HALL WOULD HAVE NO PARALLEL IN THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE WORLD AND YOUR PALACE WOULD BE THE WONDER OF THE UNIVERSE MY GOOD MOTHER SAID THE PRINCESS WHAT IS A ROC AND WHERE MAY ONE GET AN EGG PRINCESS REPLIED THE PRETENDED FATIMA IT IS A BIRD OF PRODIGIOUS SIZE WHICH INHABITS THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT CAUCASUS
BUT MY HEART LEAPED WITHIN ME TO SEE HER ENGLISH COLORS
AND HAVING A VERY SHORT CUT AND ALL DOWN HILL PLACED MYSELF IN THE WAY BETWEEN THE PURSUERS AND THE PURSUED HALLOOING ALOUD TO HIM THAT FLED WHO LOOKING BACK WAS AT FIRST PERHAPS AS MUCH FRIGHTENED AT ME AS AT THEM
BUT BEHOLD THE NIGHT CAME ON AND IT GREW VERY DARK SO THAT THEY THAT WERE BEHIND LOST THE SIGHT OF HIM THAT WENT BEFORE
WHEN THE PROCLAMATION WAS MADE THE HERALDS RETIRED AND THROUGH THE OPEN BARRIERS FIVE KNIGHTS ADVANCED SLOWLY INTO THE ARENA
WHAT SAID OBSTINATE AND LEAVE OUR FRIENDS AND OUR COMFORTS BEHIND US
THE GRAND MASTER HIMSELF IN A SHORT SPEECH ANNOUNCED THE CHARGE AGAINST THE JEWESS
AND THOUGH IT WAS NOT TWO SECONDS OF TIME THAT I COULD KEEP MYSELF SO YET IT RELIEVED ME GREATLY GAVE ME BREATH AND NEW COURAGE
SOME OF THE CREW OFFERED RESISTANCE WHICH COST THEM THEIR LIVES
THE WHICH WHEN HE HAD DONE HE SAW THE MAN DRAW HIS SWORD AND PUT AN HELMET UPON HIS HEAD AND RUSH TOWARD THE DOOR UPON THE ARMED MEN WHO LAID UPON HIM WITH DEADLY FORCE
THE HEAD OF THE ONE STUCK IN THE THROAT OF THE OTHER AND THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES
WHICH IF I HAD DONE I HAD AT LEAST BEEN MORE CHEERFULLY SUPPORTED UNDER THIS NEW SURPRISE AND PERHAPS CARRIED THROUGH IT WITH MORE RESOLUTION
BECAUSE NONE OF MY NEIGHBORS SAW THEIR DANGER AS I SAW MINE
SISTER SAID SHE GIVING IT TO HER AGAIN YOU SEE THAT I HAVE NOT KEPT YOUR MEASURE LONG
CHE
SO HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH OCCUPYING A MUCH SMALLER HOUSE WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF BUILT FROM THE WINDOWS OF WHICH HE COULD STILL LOOK OUT ON THE ANCIENT ABODE OF HIS FOREFATHERS AS IT DWINDLED YEAR BY YEAR TO THE CONDITION OF A NEGLECTED RUIN
THE CLANG OF THE BLOWS AND THE SHOUTS OF THE COMBATANTS MIXED FEARFULLY WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPETS AND DROWNED THE GROANS OF THOSE WHO FELL AND LAY ROLLING BENEATH THE FEET OF THE HORSES
AS FOR MY WALL MADE AS BEFORE WITH LONG STAKES OR PILES THOSE PILES GREW ALL LIKE TREES AND WERE BY THIS TIME GROWN SO BIG AND SPREAD SO VERY MUCH THAT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST APPEARANCE TO ANY ONE'S VIEW OF ANY HABITATION BEHIND THEM
AN INNUMERABLE MULTITUDE OF FRIGHTFUL SAVAGES ABOUT TWO FEET HIGH COVERED ALL OVER WITH RED HAIR CAME SWIMMING TOWARD US AND ENCOMPASSED OUR SHIP
ALADDIN ROSE BEFORE DAYBREAK AWAKENED HIS MOTHER PRESSING HER TO GO TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE AND TO GET ADMITTANCE IF POSSIBLE BEFORE THE GRAND VIZIER THE OTHER VIZIERS AND THE GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WENT IN TO TAKE THEIR SEATS IN THE DIVAN WHERE THE SULTAN ALWAYS ATTENDED IN PERSON
I ORDERED FRIDAY AND THE CAPTAIN'S MATE TO GO OVER THE LITTLE CREEK WESTWARD TOWARDS THE PLACE WHERE THE SAVAGES CAME ON SHORE WHEN FRIDAY WAS RESCUED AND SO SOON AS THEY CAME TO A LITTLE RISING GROUND AT ABOUT HALF A MILE DISTANT I BID THEM HALLOO OUT AS LOUD AS THEY COULD AND WAIT TILL THEY FOUND THE SEAMEN HEARD THEM
A FINE HAMMOCK A HANDSOME FIELD-BED TWO CHAIRS A TABLE AND A CABINET
THE DYING DECLARATION OF MEG MERRILIES WAS PROVED BY THE SURGEON AND THE CLERGYMAN WHO HAD HEARD IT
THE FOURTH VOYAGE AFTER I HAD RESTED FROM THE DANGERS OF MY THIRD VOYAGE MY PASSION FOR TRADE AND MY LOVE OF NOVELTY SOON AGAIN PREVAILED
A LITTLE AFTER THE ROBBER AND BABA MUSTAPHA HAD PARTED MORGIANA WENT OUT OF ALI BABA'S HOUSE UPON SOME ERRAND AND UPON HER RETURN SEEING THE MARK THE ROBBER HAD MADE STOPPED TO OBSERVE IT
THE LANCES BURST INTO SHIVERS BOTH THE KNIGHTS BEING ALMOST UNHORSED
SO THEY FOLLOWED AND HE WENT BEFORE THEM
THEY SECURED ALL THE REST THAT WERE UPON THE MAIN AND QUARTER DECKS AND BEGAN TO FASTEN THE HATCHES TO KEEP THEM DOWN THAT WERE BELOW
ENTER AND COME UP THE PRIVATE DOOR WHICH WAS JUST UNDER THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT WAS SOON OPENED AND ALADDIN CONDUCTED UP INTO THE CHAMBER
FOR UPON SOME WORDS HE SPOKE THEY WENT TO REAP THE CORN IN THE FIELD WHERE I LAY
WHERE'S MUSTARDSEED READY SAID MUSTARDSEED
HE ENTERED THE CAVERN AND BY THE CONDITION HE FOUND THINGS IN JUDGED THAT NOBODY HAD BEEN THERE SINCE THE CAPTAIN HAD FETCHED THE GOODS FOR HIS SHOP
MAC-GUFFOG WHO HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED WAS AT THE TIME THE KEEPER
FOR I SAW THE SEA COME AFTER ME AS HIGH AS A GREAT HILL AND AS FURIOUS AS AN ENEMY WHICH I HAD NO MEANS OR STRENGTH TO CONTEND WITH
SUBMIT TO THY FATE EMBRACE OUR RELIGION AND THOU SHALT GO FORTH IN SUCH STATE THAT MANY A NORMAN LADY SHALL ENVY THEE THY LOT SUBMIT TO MY FATE SAID REBECCA AND SACRED HEAVEN
AND THEREFORE LEAVE OFF TO PERSUADE ME FURTHER
NOW IN THIS PLACE CHRISTIAN HAD DOUBLE SORROW BECAUSE TWAS THROUGH HIS UNADVISED HASTE THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO THIS DISTRESS
GRATIFY ME IN WHAT I ASK YOU SO SAYING HE PUT ANOTHER PIECE OF GOLD INTO HIS HAND
AND WHEN THEY HAD OBLIGED THEM TO QUIT THEIR PREY ONE OF THEM CAME TO THE NEST WHERE I WAS
AND THOUGH THEY WERE BUT DWARFS YET THAT WE MUST MAKE NO RESISTANCE FOR THEY WERE MORE IN NUMBER THAN THE LOCUSTS
IN THE MEANTIME ALADDIN'S MOTHER ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND HAVING PROSTRATED HERSELF SAID TO THE SULTAN SIRE MY SON KNOWS THIS PRESENT IS MUCH BELOW THE NOTICE OF PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR
WHILE I WAS DOING THIS I FOUND THE TIDE BEGIN TO FLOW THOUGH VERY CALM
THREE OF THE WEAPONS STRUCK AGAINST HIM AND SPLINTERED WITH AS LITTLE EFFECT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AGAINST A TOWER OF STEEL
BUT MY DELIVERANCE CAME SOONER THAN I EXPECTED AND IN A MANNER NOT VERY COMMON
WHETHER IN DANGER OF WILD BEASTS OR NOT
I THEN TOOK SOME REFRESHMENT AND WENT TO MY REST
BUT HE SOON GOT OVER AND THAT WITHOUT HALF THAT DIFFICULTY WHICH THE OTHER TWO MEN MET WITH
THAT WILL GIVE HIM HIS OLD SIGHT AND HIS OLD LOVE
THE ONLY INFORMATION WHICH COULD BE COLLECTED FROM THE BYSTANDERS WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN RAISED WITH CARE BY CERTAIN WELL ATTIRED GROOMS AND PLACED IN A LITTER BELONGING TO A LADY AMONG THE SPECTATORS IN WHICH HE HAD IMMEDIATELY BEEN TRANSPORTED OUT OF THE PRESS
HOW STRANGE A CHEQUER-WORK OF PROVIDENCE IS THE LIFE OF MAN
HE LOOKED AT THEM A LONG TIME IN HIS HAND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD BUT AT LAST HE PULLED OUT HIS PURSE AND PUT THEM IN
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS WHEN THE ROMANCE OF LEMUEL GULLIVER APPEARED IN 1727 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SEIZED UPON BY AN EAGER PUBLIC
THE GIANTS WHO PERCEIVED THIS TOOK UP GREAT STONES AND RUNNING TO THE SHORE ENTERED THE WATER UP TO THE MIDDLE AND THREW SO EXACTLY THAT THEY SUNK ALL THE RAFTS BUT THAT I WAS UPON
AND HAVING MADE A HARD SHIFT TO SCREW IT DOWN AGAIN DIRECTLY UNDER THE SHIPPING-BOARD THAT I HAD LATELY OPENED I MOUNTED ON THE CHAIR AND PUTTING MY MOUTH AS NEAR AS I COULD TO THE HOLE I CALLED FOR HELP IN A LOUD VOICE AND IN ALL THE LANGUAGES I UNDERSTOOD
THERE WERE SIX SPANISH PIECES OF FOUR PISTOLES EACH BESIDES TWENTY OR THIRTY SMALLER COINS
SO I TURNED TO GO AWAY AND BECKONED HIM TO FOLLOW ME MAKING SIGN TO HIM THAT MORE MIGHT COME AFTER THEM
TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL PRESENT HOWEVER THE KNIGHT THUS PREFERRED WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
THEREFORE YOU MUST DO ME THE FAVOR TO STAY
THE ARABIAN NIGHTS ALL NATIONS HAVE THEIR FAIRY TALES BUT INDIA SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH THEY ALL STARTED CARRIED ON THEIR TRAVELS BY THE PROFESSIONAL STORY-TELLERS WHO KEPT THE TALES ALIVE THROUGHOUT ASIA
FOR DEPEND UPON IT EVERY MAN THAT COMES ASHORE IS OUR OWN AND SHALL DIE OR LIVE AS THEY BEHAVE TO US AS I SPOKE THIS WITH A RAISED VOICE AND CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE I FOUND IT GREATLY ENCOURAGED HIM
CASSIM ROSE THE NEXT MORNING LONG BEFORE THE SUN AND SET OUT FOR THE FOREST WITH TEN MULES BEARING GREAT CHESTS WHICH HE DESIGNED TO FILL AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD WHICH ALI BABA HAD POINTED OUT TO HIM
BEFORE GUY MANNERING TOOK HIS DEPARTURE FROM ELLANGOWAN MR BERTRAM ASKED HIM THE RESULT OF HIS STUDYING THE STARS ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND IN REPLY WAS HANDED A PAPER BY MANNERING WHICH HE WAS TOLD HE SHOULD KEEP IN A SEALED ENVELOPE FOR FIVE WHOLE YEARS
HOWEVER THEY SOON RETURNED AND ONE OF THEM WHO VENTURED SO FAR AS TO GET A FULL SIGHT OF MY FACE LIFTING UP HIS HANDS AND EYES BY WAY OF ADMIRATION CRIED OUT IN A SHRILL BUT DISTINCT VOICE HEKINAH DEGUL
AND CHAIN HIM DOWN UPON THE BARS SAID FRONT DE-BOEUF
IT WAS ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF A KENTISH PIPPIN AND GROWN SO HARD THAT WHEN I RETURNED TO ENGLAND I GOT IT HOLLOWED INTO A CUP AND SET IT IN SILVER
HALF STUPEFIED HE WENT BACK
SO I DID NOT LET MY DREAM COME TO PASS IN THAT PART THAT HE CAME INTO MY GROVE FOR SHELTER
I WAS ASSURED THAT A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE MY ARRIVAL FLIMNAP WOULD HAVE INFALLIBLY BROKE HIS NECK IF ONE OF THE KING'S CUSHIONS THAT ACCIDENTALLY LAY ON THE GROUND HAD NOT WEAKENED THE FORCE OF HIS FALL
2D
AT LEAST SHE SAID THOSE WHO TREMBLE NOT AT THY CRIME WILL HOLD THEE ACCURSED FOR HAVING SO FAR DISHONOURED THE CROSS THOU WEAREST AS TO FOLLOW A DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE THOU ART KEEN-WITTED JEWESS REPLIED THE TEMPLAR WELL AWARE OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT SHE SPOKE
AND WITH THEE I MOURN WITHOUT THE LIGHT
CASSIM MARRIED A VERY RICH WIFE AND BECAME A WEALTHY MERCHANT
AT WHOSE NOD THE PRINCES OF THE EARTH SHAKE THEIR KNEES
THAT IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT FIND ME YET THEY WOULD FIND MY ENCLOSURE DESTROY ALL MY CORN AND CARRY AWAY ALL MY FLOCK OF TAME GOATS AND I SHOULD PERISH AT LAST FOR MERE WANT
AND THE CAPTAIN SAID HE KNEW THEY WERE SUCH ROGUES THAT THERE WAS NO OBLIGING THEM AND IF HE DID CARRY THEM AWAY IT MUST BE IN IRONS AS MALEFACTORS TO BE DELIVERED OVER TO JUSTICE AT THE FIRST ENGLISH COLONY HE COULD COME TO
NOW WHEN THEY WERE GONE OVER THE STILE THEY BEGAN TO CONTRIVE WITH THEMSELVES WHAT THEY SHOULD DO AT THAT STILE TO PREVENT THOSE THAT SHOULD COME AFTER FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF GIANT DESPAIR
IT WAS OF A MAN WHO HAD MURDERED ONE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE
CRUSOE SAVES THE CAPTAIN AND TWO OF THE CREW AND SEIZES THE SHIP'S BOAT WHILE WE WERE THUS PREPARING OUR DESIGNS AND HAD FIRST BY MAIN STRENGTH HEAVED THE BOAT UPON THE BEACH SO HIGH THAT THE TIDE WOULD NOT FLOAT HER OFF AT HIGH-WATER MARK AND BESIDES HAD BROKE A HOLE IN HER BOTTOM TOO BIG TO BE QUICKLY STOPPED AND WERE SET DOWN MUSING WHAT WE SHOULD DO WE HEARD THE SHIP FIRE A GUN AND MAKE A WAFT WITH HER ENSIGN AS A SIGNAL FOR THE BOAT TO COME ON BOARD-BUT NO BOAT STIRRED
BUT MY TIME OR LABOR WAS LITTLE WORTH AND SO IT WAS AS WELL EMPLOYED ONE WAY AS ANOTHER
ONE DAY WE LANDED ON AN ISLAND COVERED WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF FRUIT-TREES BUT WE COULD SEE NEITHER MAN NOR ANIMAL WE WALKED IN THE MEADOWS ALONG THE STREAMS THAT WATERED THEM
I WAS FOR FOUR HOURS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EXPECTING AND INDEED WISHING EVERY MOMENT TO BE MY LAST
THAT THE STUMPS OF MY BEARD WERE TEN TIMES STRONGER THAN THE BRISTLES OF A BOAR AND MY COMPLEXION MADE UP OF SEVERAL COLORS ALTOGETHER DISAGREEABLE
WITNESSES WHO WERE EXAMINED SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE SMUGGLER'S SHIP GROUNDING AND TAKING FIRE AND FINALLY BLOWING UP WITH A GREAT EXPLOSION
BUT HIS COUNTENANCE WAS AS PALE AS DEATH AND MARKED IN ONE OR TWO PLACES WITH STREAKS OF BLOOD
BUT WITH MUCH SEARCH I FOUND THEM TWO OF THEM DRY AND GOOD THE THIRD HAD TAKEN WATER
THEN HE WENT TO THE OUTWARD DOOR THAT LEADS INTO THE CASTLE-YARD AND WITH HIS KEY OPENED THAT DOOR ALSO
FOR I SWEAR BY MY INFERNAL DEN THAT THOU SHALT GO NO FURTHER
I HAD THREE ENCOURAGEMENTS--1ST A SMOOTH CALM SEA
HE SEEMED TO APPREHEND MY MEANING
THE GREEN EMERALDS
ROWENA HERSELF HOWEVER HAD NEVER GIVEN HER CONSENT TO SUCH AN ALLIANCE
I OPENED IT IN HIS OWN PRESENCE AND SHOWED HIM THE SMALL COLLECTION OF RARITIES I MADE IN THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH I HAD BEEN SO STRANGELY DELIVERED
AND AS HE INSTANTLY OBEYED THE SUMMONS REBECCA FOUND HERSELF ONCE MORE ALONE
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE HAD FAIRLY FORCED HIMSELF INTO IT WHEN I TOOK MY ADVANTAGE AND FELL UPON HIM WITH THE BUTT-END OF MY WHIP
MOST OF THE GARRISON RESISTED TO THE UTTERMOST
AND ON HER ARRIVAL SAID WITH MUCH SIMPLICITY SON I HAVE SEEN THE SULTAN AND AM VERY WELL PERSUADED HE HAS SEEN ME TOO FOR I PLACED MYSELF JUST BEFORE HIM
MEANWHILE THE CAPTAIN HAVING RECEIVED ON BOARD THOSE WHO WERE IN THE SLOOP AND TAKEN UP SOME OF THOSE THAT SWAM RESOLVED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FAVORABLE GALE THAT HAD JUST RISEN AND HOISTING HIS SAILS PURSUED HIS VOYAGE
IN THE THICK OF THE PRESS AND TURMOIL OF THE FIGHT BOIS-GUILBERT AND THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT REPEATEDLY ENDEAVOURED TO SINGLE OUT EACH OTHER SPURRED BY MUTUAL ANIMOSITY
THE WIFE REJOICED GREATLY AT THEIR GOOD-FORTUNE AND WOULD COUNT ALL THE GOLD PIECE BY PIECE
CALL UPON THE ALMIGHTY HE WILL HELP THEE
SO I WAS FORCED TO GIVE IT OVER
FIRST HE HAD BROUGHT ME A CASE OF BOTTLES FULL OF EXCELLENT CORDIAL WATERS SIX LARGE BOTTLES OF MADEIRA WINE THE BOTTLES HELD TWO QUARTS EACH TWO POUNDS OF EXCELLENT GOOD TOBACCO TWELVE GOOD PIECES OF THE SHIP'S BEEF AND SIX PIECES OF PORK WITH A BAG OF PEAS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED-WEIGHT OF BISCUIT
YES MY WIFE AND CHILDREN SAW ME AT THE FIRST AND CALLED AFTER ME TO TURN AGAIN
WHEN WE HAVE DONE I WILL TELL YOU ACCORDINGLY BOTH MOTHER AND SON SAT DOWN AND ATE WITH THE BETTER RELISH AS THE TABLE WAS SO WELL FURNISHED
AND THE GENIE SAID IN A LOUD AND TERRIBLE VOICE IS IT NOT ENOUGH THAT I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP HAVE DONE EVERYTHING FOR YOU BUT YOU BY AN UNHEARD OF INGRATITUDE MUST COMMAND ME TO BRING MY MASTER AND HANG HIM UP IN THE MIDST OF THIS DOME
ALI BABA AND HIS SON SHOCKED AT THIS ACTION CRIED OUT ALOUD
I FELL INVOLUNTARILY TO THE GROUND WITH FEAR AND AS IT AFTERWARD APPEARED HE SPRANG OVER ME
THE SHIPS ARRIVED AT LAST AND MY MASTER HIMSELF HAVING MADE CHOICE OF THE SHIP WHEREIN I WAS TO EMBARK LOADED HALF OF IT WITH IVORY ON MY ACCOUNT LAID IN PROVISIONS IN ABUNDANCE FOR MY PASSAGE AND BESIDES OBLIGED ME TO ACCEPT A PRESENT OF SOME CURIOSITIES OF THE COUNTRY OF GREAT VALUE
AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF SAID TRULY ENOUGH I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WOMAN BY RIGHT OLIVER WENT BACK TO HIS BROTHER AND TOLD HIM ALL THIS SAYING I LOVE ALIENA SO WELL THAT I WILL GIVE UP MY ESTATES TO YOU AND MARRY HER AND LIVE HERE AS A SHEPHERD LET YOUR WEDDING BE TO-MORROW SAID ORLANDO AND I WILL ASK THE DUKE AND HIS FRIENDS WHEN ORLANDO TOLD GANYMEDE HOW HIS BROTHER WAS TO BE MARRIED ON THE MORROW HE ADDED
WHICH AFTERWARDS WHEN THOSE STAKES GREW AS THEY ALL DID IN THE NEXT RAINY SEASON MADE THE ENCLOSURE STRONG LIKE A WALL INDEED STRONGER THAN ANY WALL
AT MY BACK I CARRIED MY BASKET AND ON MY SHOULDER MY GUN AND OVER MY HEAD A GREAT CLUMSY UGLY GOAT'S-SKIN UMBRELLA BUT WHICH AFTER ALL WAS THE MOST NECESSARY THING I HAD ABOUT ME NEXT TO MY GUN
THE GIANT THEREFORE DROVE THEM BEFORE HIM AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CASTLE INTO A VERY DARK DUNGEON NASTY AND STINKING TO THE SPIRITS OF THESE TWO MEN
DO YE FLY FROM THE EMPTY BLAST OF A HORN BLOWN BY A JESTER ANIMATED BY HIS WORDS THEY ATTACKED THE BLACK KNIGHT ANEW WHOSE BEST REFUGE WAS NOW TO PLACE HIS BACK AGAINST AN OAK AND DEFEND HIMSELF WITH HIS SWORD
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE RETOLD BY E
CHILD SAID SHE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE THAT HAVE THAT RING ON THEIR FINGER
I LOOKED ON BOTH SIDES FOR A PROPER PLACE TO GET TO SHORE FOR I WAS NOT WILLING TO BE DRIVEN TOO HIGH UP THE RIVER
AS THE RAGE OF THE WIND WAS STILL GREAT THOUGH RATHER LESS THAN AT FIRST WE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS HOPE TO HAVE THE SHIP HOLD MANY MINUTES WITHOUT BREAKING IN PIECES UNLESS THE WINDS BY A KIND OF MIRACLE SHOULD TURN IMMEDIATELY ABOUT
UPON WHICH I TOSSED HER A BIT OF BISCUIT THOUGH BY THE WAY I WAS NOT VERY FREE OF IT FOR MY STORE WAS NOT GREAT
THEIR CHAIRS WERE BLACK AND FORMED A MARKED CONTRAST TO THE WARLIKE APPEARANCE OF THE KNIGHTS WHO ATTENDED THE SOLEMN GATHERING
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS HE SAID
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE QUEEN WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE RAN WITH IT IN HER LAP TO THE KING WHO ORDERED IT TO BE PUT INTO A CISTERN FULL OF WATER WITH ME IN IT BY WAY OF TRIAL
FAREWELL FOR EVER SO SAYING SHE LEFT THE APARTMENT
THEY HAD NOT BEEN LONG IN THAT POSTURE WHEN THE BOATSWAIN WHO WAS THE PRINCIPAL RINGLEADER OF THE MUTINY AND HAD NOW SHOWN HIMSELF THE MOST DEJECTED AND DISPIRITED OF ALL THE REST CAME WALKING TOWARDS THEM WITH TWO MORE OF THE CREW
AND THIS THREW ME INTO TERRIBLE AGONIES OF MIND THAT FOR A WHILE I RAN ABOUT LIKE A MADMAN
TAKE THE LAMP DOWN AND PUT IT OUT
AND THIS EXTREMITY ROUSED MY APPLICATION
NEITHER COULD I POSSIBLY HAVE PRESERVED THEM IN SO LONG A VOYAGE IF THE CAPTAIN HAD NOT ALLOWED ME SOME OF HIS BEST BISCUIT WHICH RUBBED TO POWDER AND MINGLED WITH WATER WAS THEIR CONSTANT FOOD
IF WRONG THEN HE WAS BOUND BY OATH NEVER TO REVEAL WHICH CASKET HE CHOSE NEVER TO MARRY AND TO GO AWAY AT ONCE
HE HAD COME THE JEW WAS INFORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CORRECTING AND PUNISHING MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY WHOSE CONDUCT HAD OF LATE BEEN OPEN TO SEVERE CENSURE
IN THIS DISTRESS WE HAD BESIDES THE TERROR OF THE STORM ONE OF OUR MEN DIE OF THE CALENTURE AND A MAN AND A BOY WASHED OVERBOARD
I KEPT THERE WITH HIM ALL THAT NIGHT
BUT HOWEVER THEY WERE RESOLVED TO PURSUE HIM WHICH THEY DID AND IN A LITTLE TIME THEY OVERTOOK HIM
AT THIS TIME THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS WITH WHOM I HAD CONTRACTED A VERY STRICT FRIENDSHIP FELL SICK AND DIED
THAT I WAS AS ONE WHOM HEAVEN THOUGHT NOT WORTHY TO BE NUMBERED AMONG THE LIVING OR TO APPEAR AMONG THE REST OF HIS CREATURES
SOON AFTER THE VAST MULTITUDE HAD RETIRED FROM THE DESERTED FIELD AND LIGHTS BEGAN TO GLIMMER THROUGH THE TWILIGHT ANNOUNCING THE TOIL OF THE ARMOURERS WHICH WAS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT IN ORDER TO REPAIR OR ALTER THE SUITS OF ARMOUR TO BE USED AGAIN ON THE MORROW
BUT WHILE I STRIKE A LIGHT GATHER UP ALL THE LOOSE DRY STICKS YOU CAN SEE TO KINDLE A FIRE WITH ALADDIN FOUND SO MANY DRIED STICKS THAT HE SOON COLLECTED A GREAT HEAP
BUT CHEERED IN SOME MEASURE BY THE KINDLY WORDS OF A RABBI WHO WAS WITH HIM HE DETERMINED WEAK AND FEVERISH THOUGH HE WAS TO MAKE A LAST EFFORT FOR THE CHILD HE LOVED SO DEARLY
NESBIT THE TEMPEST E
COME DOWN HE SAID RASH GIRL
HE THEN INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO MANNERING AND SAID HIS NAME WAS DIRCK HATTERAICK THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL THAT WAS LYING OFF THE SHORE
I HEARD SEVERAL BANGS OR BUFFETS AS I THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE EAGLE FOR SUCH I AM CERTAIN IT MUST HAVE BEEN THAT HELD THE CORD OF MY BOX IN HIS BEAK AND THEN ALL ON A SUDDEN FELT MYSELF FALLING PERPENDICULARLY DOWN FOR ABOVE A MINUTE BUT WITH SUCH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS THAT I ALMOST LOST MY BREATH
AND TO TERRIFY ANY PERSON OR ACCOMPLICE WHO SHOULD ATTEMPT THE SAME THING THEY AGREED TO CUT CASSIM'S BODY INTO FOUR QUARTERS--TO HANG TWO ON ONE SIDE AND TWO ON THE OTHER WITHIN THE DOOR OF THE CAVE
HOWEVER UPON STRICT REVIEW I BLOTTED OUT SEVERAL PASSAGES OF LESS MOMENT WHICH WERE IN MY FIRST COPY FOR FEAR OF BEING CENSURED AS TEDIOUS AND TRIFLING WHEREOF TRAVELLERS ARE OFTEN PERHAPS NOT WITHOUT JUSTICE ACCUSED
AS HE WAS ONE DAY PLAYING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM IN THE STREET WITH HIS EVIL ASSOCIATES A STRANGER PASSING BY STOOD TO OBSERVE HIM
I WILL GO AND SELL IT AND THE MONEY I SHALL GET FOR IT WILL SERVE BOTH FOR BREAKFAST AND DINNER AND PERHAPS SUPPER TOO ALADDIN'S MOTHER TOOK THE LAMP AND SAID TO HER SON HERE IT IS BUT IT IS VERY DIRTY
MY ANSWER WAS THAT I THOUGHT WE WERE OVERSTOCKED WITH BOOKS OF TRAVELS
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE CITY I PRAYED THE KING TO ALLOW ME TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY AND HE GRANTED ME PERMISSION IN THE MOST OBLIGING AND HONORABLE MANNER
I PERCEIVED ONE OF THEM IMMEDIATELY FALL BEING KNOCKED DOWN I SUPPOSE WITH A CLUB OR WOODEN SWORD FOR THAT WAS THEIR WAY
THIS FLEET SAILED ROUND WHILE I WENT BACK THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE COAST WHERE I FIRST DISCOVERED THE BOAT
I CHALLENGE THE PRIVILEGE OF TRIAL BY COMBAT AND WILL APPEAR BY MY CHAMPION
IT WAS BY GOOD FORTUNE THAT NO ILL ACCIDENT HAPPENED IN THESE ENTERTAINMENTS ONLY ONCE A FIERY HORSE THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF THE CAPTAINS PAWING WITH HIS HOOF STRUCK A HOLE IN MY HANDKERCHIEF AND HIS FOOT SLIPPING HE OVERTHREW HIS RIDER AND HIMSELF
I HAVE A KEY IN MY BOSOM CALLED PROMISE THAT WILL I AM PERSUADED OPEN ANY LOCK IN DOUBTING CASTLE
NOW WHILE THEY WERE THUS DRAWING TOWARDS THE GATE BEHOLD A COMPANY OF THE HEAVENLY HOST CAME OUT TO MEET THEM
AND IT WAS NO WONDER FOR THE PHYSICIANS BY THE EMPEROR'S ORDER HAD MINGLED A SLEEPY POTION IN THE HOGSHEADS OF WINE
THIS ACCIDENT ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED GLUMDALCLITCH NEVER TO TRUST ME ABROAD FOR THE FUTURE OUT OF HER SIGHT
BUT AS I CAME UP AGAIN I FORTUNATELY CAUGHT HOLD OF A PIECE OF THE WRECK AND SWIMMING SOMETIMES WITH ONE HAND AND SOMETIMES WITH THE OTHER BUT ALWAYS HOLDING FAST THE PLANK THE WIND AND THE TIDE FAVORING ME I CAME TO AN ISLAND AND GOT SAFELY ASHORE
THE SKY HAD BECOME BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR FOR THE RISING WIND HAD SWEPT AWAY THE CLOUDS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY OVERCAST AND THE OBSERVER WAS ENABLED TO NOTE CAREFULLY THE POSITIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL PLANETS FROM WHICH HE MADE OUT THAT THREE PERIODS OF THE INFANT'S LIFE WOULD BE ATTENDED BY GREAT DANGER TO HIM NAMELY HIS FIFTH HIS TENTH AND HIS TWENTY-FIRST YEAR
AFTER THE FEAST THE SULTAN SENT FOR THE CHIEF CADI AND COMMANDED HIM TO DRAW UP A CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR AND ALADDIN
AS THE PILGRIM ENTERED SHE ORDERED HER ATTENDANTS EXCEPTING ONLY ONE TO RETIRE
I WAS READY TO BURST WITH HOLDING MY BREATH WHEN AS I FELT MYSELF RISING UP SO TO MY IMMEDIATE RELIEF I FOUND MY HEAD AND HANDS SHOOT OUT ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
BUT I COULD NOT DEPEND BY ANY MEANS UPON MY DREAM THAT THE OTHER SAVAGES WOULD NOT PURSUE HIM THITHER AND FIND HIM THERE
THAT IT WAS NOTHING ELSE BUT MY OWN FOOT
HAVING FAILED TO GIVE ANY EXPLANATION OF SO MANY SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THE WARRANT FOR HIS COMMITTAL TO GAOL WAS MADE OUT ALTHOUGH HE STATED THAT COLONEL MANNERING WHOM HE HAD KNOWN IN INDIA COULD IF SENT FOR GIVE EVIDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER AND RANK
SO THAT FRIDAY COULD NO WAY COME AT ME IN THE INSIDE OF MY INNERMOST WALL WITHOUT MAKING SO MUCH NOISE IN GETTING OVER THAT IT MUST NEEDS AWAKEN ME
I WISH TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHAT IT WAS YOU LATELY SAID IN THE STREET AT THIS REQUEST HINDBAD HUNG DOWN HIS HEAD IN CONFUSION AND REPLIED
I OBSERVED THAT THE TWO WHO SWAM WERE YET MORE THAN TWICE AS LONG SWIMMING OVER THE CREEK AS THE FELLOW WAS THAT FLED FROM THEM
AT LENGTH HE YIELDED AND THE EXCHANGE OF DRESS WAS ACCOMPLISHED
ON HEARING THIS THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD INVITED THE HOLY FATIMA TO STAY WITH HER AND THAT SHE WAS NOW IN THE PALACE
FINDING IT WAS LIKELY TO OVERBLOW WE TOOK IN OUR SPRIT-SAIL AND STOOD BY TO HAND THE FORESAIL
BUT DO NOT MISTAKE
THEY WERE VERY TIRED WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE FOREST OF ARDEN FROM THE PAINTING BY CHARLES FOLKARD SPEAK FOR JOY FOUND WORDS TO SWEAR THAT HE WOULD NEVER PART WITH THE RING WHILE HE LIVED
ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK WITH SPEAR WITH AXE OR WITH SWORD I AM ALIKE READY TO ENCOUNTER THEE WITHOUT ALIGHTING FROM HIS HORSE THE CONQUEROR CALLED FOR A BOWL OF WINE AND OPENING THE BEAVER OF HIS HELMET ANNOUNCED THAT HE QUAFFED IT TO ALL TRUE ENGLISH HEARTS AND TO THE CONFUSION OF FOREIGN TYRANTS HE THEN DESIRED A HERALD TO PROCLAIM THAT HE WAS WILLING TO ENCOUNTER THE REST OF THE CHALLENGERS IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY PLEASED TO ADVANCE AGAINST HIM
ABOUT THE TWELFTH DAY THE WEATHER ABATING A LITTLE THE MASTER MADE AN OBSERVATION AS WELL AS HE COULD AND FOUND THAT HE WAS IN ABOUT ELEVEN DEGREES OF NORTH LATITUDE BUT THAT HE WAS TWENTY-TWO DEGREES OF LONGITUDE DIFFERENCE WEST FROM CAPE ST AUGUSTINO
ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OCCURRENCE WERE EXAGGERATED
ALI BABA ROSE BEFORE DAY AND FOLLOWED BY HIS SLAVE WENT TO THE BATHS ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE IMPORTANT EVENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED AT HOME
THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS FLEET YET HE OWED GREAT OBLIGATIONS TO ME FOR MANY GOOD OFFICES I HAD DONE HIM IN MAKING THE PEACE
THE SOUNDS OF MY NATIVE LANGUAGE ARE SWEET TO MINE EARS THOUGH SELDOM HEARD FOR MANY YEARS SHE THEN TOLD HIM THE STORY OF HER UNHAPPY AND DEGRADED LIFE AND HOW SHE WAS ONCE THE DAUGHTER OF THE NOBLE THANE OF TORQUILSTONE
BUT WERE AWAKENED BY THE NOISE OF A SERPENT OF SURPRISING LENGTH AND THICKNESS WHOSE SCALES MADE A RUSTLING NOISE AS HE WOUND HIMSELF ALONG
MY CONSCIENCE TOO AFFLICTED ME
THE PURPLE AMETHYSTS
THIS WITNESS ALSO STATED THAT IT WAS HE THAT HAD TOLD HIS AUNT MEG MERRILIES THAT BERTRAM HAD RETURNED TO THE COUNTRY
HE THEREFORE ACQUAINTED HIS FATHER ALI BABA WITH HIS WISH TO INVITE HIM IN RETURN
FOR THEY HAD WEIGHED HER ANCHOR AS SOON AS THEY WERE MASTERS OF HER AND THE WEATHER BEING FAIR HAD BROUGHT HER TO AN ANCHOR JUST AGAINST THE MOUTH OF THE LITTLE CREEK
THE VASES BASINS AND GOBLETS WERE GOLD ALSO AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP AND ALL THE OTHER ORNAMENTS AND EMBELLISHMENTS OF THE HALL WERE ANSWERABLE TO THIS DISPLAY
ALSO SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS STOOD CRYING AND CALLING AFTER ME TO RETURN
NOW MY LIFE BEGAN TO BE SO EASY THAT I BEGAN TO SAY TO MYSELF THAT COULD I BUT HAVE BEEN SAFE FROM MORE SAVAGES I CARED NOT IF I WAS NEVER TO REMOVE FROM THE PLACE WHERE I LIVED
BUT HIS ANGRY CONFUSION BECAME ONLY MORE MARKED AS THE PILGRIM WENT ON TO GIVE THE NAMES OF THE ENGLISH KNIGHTS WHO HAD SO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES
THAT IS TO SAY I PROSTRATED MYSELF AT HIS FEET
CEDRIC WHO HAD BEEN STRUCK MUTE BY THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF HIS BANISHED SON NOW RUSHED FORWARD AS IF TO SEPARATE HIM FROM ROWENA
THEY SAID TO PERSUADE YOU TO GO BACK WITH US
THE BOY TOOK ME OUT IN MY BOX ABOUT HALF AN HOUR'S WALK FROM THE PALACE TOWARD THE ROCKS ON THE SEA-SHORE
AND NOW I EXPECTED THAT PART OF MY DREAM WAS COMING TO PASS AND THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SHELTER IN MY GROVE
THE ELEPHANTS OF OUR FOREST HAVE EVERY YEAR KILLED US A GREAT MANY SLAVES WHOM WE SENT TO SEEK IVORY
AND MEG WHO NOW THREW SOME FLAX UPON THE FIRE WHICH ROSE IN A BRIGHT FLAME ANSWERED
AS HE APPROACHED HE BEGAN CRYING WHO WILL CHANGE OLD LAMPS FOR NEW ONES AS HE WENT ALONG A CROWD OF CHILDREN COLLECTED WHO HOOTED AND THOUGHT HIM AS DID ALL WHO CHANCED TO BE PASSING BY A MADMAN OR A FOOL TO OFFER TO CHANGE NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES
SOON AFTER MY MISTRESS CAME INTO THE ROOM WHO SEEING ME ALL BLOODY RAN AND TOOK ME UP IN HER HAND
FOR THE SOUTHERN WIND CALLED THE SOUTHERN MONSOON BEGAN TO SET IN
THOU SEEST THAT I AM IN THE DUNGEON WITH THEE A FAR WEAKER MAN BY NATURE THAN THOU ART
HIS MANNER OF FEEDING
PUCK WAS THE SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF
BUT WHEN I BEHELD THIS HILL AND HOW IT HANGS OVER THE WAY I SUDDENLY MADE A STAND LEST IT SHOULD FALL ON MY HEAD
THIS GAVE ME SOME FAINT HOPES OF RELIEF ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT ABLE TO IMAGINE HOW IT COULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT
BEFORE HE LEAVES ASK HIM TO EXCHANGE CUPS WITH YOU WHICH HE GRATIFIED AT THE HONOR YOU DO HIM WILL GLADLY DO WHEN YOU MUST GIVE HIM THE CUP CONTAINING THIS POWDER
AND THIS THE WAVES THROW UP ON THE BEACH IN GREAT QUANTITIES
FOR MY FIRST WALL HAD NOW A COMPLETE ROOF OVER IT OF LONG POLES COVERING ALL MY TENT AND LEANING UP TO THE SIDE OF THE HILL
AND GAVE HIM A CAKE OF BREAD TO DO THE LIKE WHICH HE QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH AND MADE SIGNS THAT IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR HIM
HOWEVER THERE WAS NO ROOM TO DEBATE FOR WE FANCIED THE SHIP WOULD BREAK IN PIECES EVERY MINUTE AND SOME TOLD US SHE WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN ALREADY
AND THE HEAD WHEN IT FELL ON THE SCAFFOLD FLOOR GAVE SUCH A BOUNCE AS MADE ME START ALTHOUGH I WERE AT LEAST HALF AN ENGLISH MILE DISTANT
HE ANSWERED I HAVE EAT AND DRANK IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING AND HE HAS TAUGHT IN OUR STREETS
PLI
PLI
PLI
WHENCE DID YOU COME I BEGGED OF THEM FIRST TO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN I WOULD SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE
OUR BAIRNS ARE HANGING AT OUR WEARY BACKS
AND THAT KEEPING THEM IN MY REACH DEPENDED ENTIRELY UPON MY PERFECTING MY ENCLOSURES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT I MIGHT BE SURE OF KEEPING THEM TOGETHER
ALADDIN TAKING THE MONEY VERY EAGERLY RETIRED WITH SO MUCH HASTE THAT THE JEW NOT CONTENT WITH THE EXORBITANCY OF HIS PROFIT WAS VEXED HE HAD NOT PENETRATED INTO HIS IGNORANCE AND WAS GOING TO RUN AFTER HIM TO ENDEAVOR TO GET SOME CHANGE OUT OF THE PIECE OF GOLD
GREETING IN THE NAME OF THE SOVEREIGN GUIDE OF THE RIGHT WAY FROM THE SERVANT OF GOD HAROUN-AL-RASCHID WHOM GOD HATH SET IN THE PLACE OF VICEGERENT TO HIS PROPHET AFTER HIS ANCESTORS OF HAPPY MEMORY TO THE POTENT AND ESTEEMED RAJA OF SERENDIB
BUT IT REQUIRED THE STRONG PRESSURE OF BOTH WAMBA AND ATHELSTANE BEFORE CEDRIC WOULD CONSENT
YEA HIMSELF HATH SHUT ME UP IN THIS IRON CAGE
SOON AFTER I HAD THUS GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER MY TWO POWERFUL ADVERSARIES MY COMPANION ARRIVED IN SEARCH OF ME
AND THE APES OUT OF REVENGE THREW COCONUTS AT US SO FAST AND WITH SUCH GESTURES AS SUFFICIENTLY TESTIFIED THEIR ANGER AND RESENTMENT
AGAIN I CONSIDERED ALSO THAT I COULD BY NO MEANS TELL FOR CERTAIN WHERE I HAD TROD AND WHERE I HAD NOT
MOST CURSED DOG OF AN ACCURSED RACE HE SAID TO ISAAC SEE'ST THOU THESE SCALES
AT LEAST I WAS IN SO WEAK A CONDITION THAT I DID NOT OBSERVE THEM
IT WAS A FRAME OF WOOD RAISED THREE INCHES FROM THE GROUND ABOUT SEVEN FEET LONG AND FOUR WIDE MOVING UPON TWENTY-TWO WHEELS
AND THEREFORE TO MAKE SURE OF THEM I DREW MY AMBUSCADE NEARER AND ORDERED FRIDAY AND THE CAPTAIN TO CREEP UPON THEIR HANDS AND FEET AS CLOSE TO THE GROUND AS THEY COULD THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE DISCOVERED AND GET AS NEAR THEM AS THEY COULD POSSIBLY BEFORE THEY OFFERED TO FIRE
WHEN DINNER WAS ALMOST DONE THE NURSE CAME IN WITH A CHILD OF A YEAR OLD IN HER ARMS WHO IMMEDIATELY SPIED ME AND BEGAN A SQUALL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD FROM LONDON BRIDGE TO CHELSEA AFTER THE USUAL ORATORY OF INFANTS TO GET ME FOR A PLAYTHING
AND AT THE TERMINATION OF THE CEREMONY I WAS LOWERED INTO THE PIT WITH A VESSEL FULL OF WATER AND SEVEN LOAVES
AND THEN MY GREAT ARMY OF FIFTY MEN WHICH WITH THOSE THREE WERE IN ALL BUT EIGHT CAME UP AND SEIZED UPON THEM AND UPON THEIR BOAT
NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED IT AND DISMISSED THEIR ATTENDANTS THAN THE GENIE THE FAITHFUL SLAVE OF THE LAMP TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT AND ALARM OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TOOK UP THE BED AND BY AN AGENCY INVISIBLE TO THEM TRANSPORTED IT IN AN INSTANT INTO ALADDIN'S CHAMBER WHERE HE SET IT DOWN
HE PULLED OUT A PIECE OF GOLD AND PUTTING IT INTO BABA MUSTAPHA'S HAND SAID TO HIM I DO NOT WANT TO LEARN YOUR SECRET THOUGH I CAN ASSUME YOU YOU MIGHT SAFELY TRUST ME WITH IT
ONLY JUST HELP COBWEB TO SCRATCH
WHO KNOWS BUT THAT GOD THAT MADE THE WORLD MAY CAUSE THAT GIANT DESPAIR MAY DIE
AND AS IT WAS FENCED IN AND THEY PINIONED THE PLACE WAS SECURE ENOUGH CONSIDERING THEY WERE UPON THEIR BEHAVIOR
WITHIN A VERY SHORT TIME A TRAIN OF FORTY BLACK SLAVES LED BY THE SAME NUMBER OF WHITE SLAVES APPEARED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE IN WHICH ALADDIN LIVED
AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD SCRAPED A HOLE IN THE SAND WITH HIS HANDS BIG ENOUGH TO BURY THE FIRST IN AND THEN DRAGGED HIM INTO IT AND COVERED HIM AND DID SO BY THE OTHER ALSO
THE MONKEY WAS SEEN BY HUNDREDS IN THE COURT SITTING UPON THE RIDGE OF A BUILDING HOLDING ME LIKE A BABY IN ONE OF HIS FORE-PAWS AND FEEDING ME WITH THE OTHER BY CRAMMING INTO MY MOUTH SOME VICTUALS HE HAD SQUEEZED OUT OF THE BAG ON ONE SIDE OF HIS CHAPS AND PATTING ME WHEN I WOULD NOT EAT
LOCKSLEY ON BEING RECOGNISED WAS WELCOMED WITH EVERY TOKEN OF RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT
FOR THERE WHERE I GO IS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE
THEN SAID HOPEFUL WHERE ARE WE NOW
THERE I COUCH WHEN OWLS DO CRY
I GAVE HIM TWO PURSES OF TWO HUNDRED SPRUGS EACH AND PROMISED WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ENGLAND TO MAKE HIM A PRESENT OF A COW AND A SHEEP
AMERICAN BOYS FIRST HAD THE CHANCE TO READ THE NOTES IN ENGLISH ABOUT THE TIME PRESIDENT MONROE WAS ELECTED ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES THERE ONCE LIVED IN A TOWN OF PERSIA TWO BROTHERS ONE NAMED CASSIM AND THE OTHER ALI BABA
THAT BY MOUNTING UPON EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS THEY HAD GOT TO THE TOP WHICH WAS FLAT AND EVEN AND STAMPING UPON IT THEY FOUND IT WAS HOLLOW WITHIN
HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS DYING
I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THAT RING AT ANOTHER TIME ALADDIN WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF SO EXTRAORDINARY A FIGURE BUT THE DANGER HE WAS IN MADE HIM ANSWER WITHOUT HESITATION WHOEVER THOU ART DELIVER ME FROM THIS PLACE HE HAD NO SOONER SPOKEN THESE WORDS THAN HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE MAGICIAN HAD LAST LEFT HIM AND NO SIGN OF CAVE OR OPENING NOR DISTURBANCE OF THE EARTH
THE MANY TESTIMONIES HE GAVE ME OF THIS PUT IT OUT OF DOUBT AND SOON CONVINCED ME THAT I NEEDED TO USE NO PRECAUTIONS FOR MY SAFETY ON HIS ACCOUNT
IVANHOE AND GUY MANNERING BEFORE WE HAVE REACHED THE SECOND PAGE OF WHAT ANTHONY TROLLOPE CALLED THE MOST FAVORITE NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THE COMMANDER OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAVE REINED UP THEIR HORSES OUTSIDE THE OLD HALL OF ROTHERWOOD AND A LOUD BLAST FROM THE HORN CONVINCES US THAT THEY WON'T WAIT VERY LONG FOR AN INVITATION TO ENTER
THIS TREE IS SO LARGE AND ITS BRANCHES SO THICK THAT ONE HUNDRED MEN MAY EASILY SIT UNDER ITS SHADE
AND SCUDDING AWAY BEFORE IT LET IT CARRY US WHEREVER FATE AND THE FURY OF THE WINDS DIRECTED
AFTER HE HAD SLUMBERED RATHER THAN SLEPT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR HE AWOKE AGAIN AND CAME OUT OF THE CAVE TO ME--FOR I HAD BEEN MILKING MY GOATS WHICH I HAD IN THE ENCLOSURE JUST BY
NOW SAID CHRISTIAN LET ME GO HENCE
AND ENRAGED TO DESPAIR AT HAVING FAILED IN HIS DESIGN HE FORCED THE LOCK OF A DOOR THAT LED FROM THE YARD TO THE GARDEN AND CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS MADE HIS ESCAPE
ATHELSTANE AND THE JEWISH MAIDEN THE FORMER BEING REPORTED AS AMONGST THE SLAIN AND REBECCA HAVING BEEN CARRIED OFF BY BOIS GUILBERT BEFORE HER FRIENDS COULD EFFECT HER RESCUE
IN TWO OR THREE DAYS TIME THE ROBBERS HAD PURCHASED THE MULES AND JARS AND AS THE MOUTHS OF THE JARS WERE RATHER TOO NARROW FOR HIS PURPOSE THE CAPTAIN CAUSED THEM TO BE WIDENED
MORGIANA WENT OUT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING TO A DRUGGIST AND ASKED FOR A SORT OF LOZENGE WHICH WAS CONSIDERED EFFICACIOUS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS DISORDERS
THE GENIE THENCE LED HIM TO THE STABLES WHERE WERE SOME OF THE FINEST HORSES IN THE WORLD AND THE GROOMS BUSY IN DRESSING THEM
WHERE I MIGHT AT LEAST PRESERVE MYSELF SOME HOURS LONGER THAN BY BEING SHUT UP AS I MAY CALL IT IN THE HOLD
WHILE THE GAY PLUMAGE SHORN FROM THE CRESTS DRIFTED UPON THE BREEZE LIKE SNOWFLAKES
AS HE LOOKED HE FANCIED HE SAW IN THE DISTANCE A BOAT BEING ROWED TOWARDS THE SHORE
THE CEREMONIES WERE AT LAST BROUGHT TO A CONCLUSION AND THE PRINCESS AND THE SON OF THE VIZIER RETIRED TO THE BEDCHAMBER PREPARED FOR THEM
AND SWEET SPRITES THE BURDEN BEAR AND FERDINAND FOLLOWED THE MAGIC SINGING AS THE SONG CHANGED TO A SOLEMN AIR AND THE WORDS BROUGHT GRIEF TO HIS HEART AND TEARS TO HIS EYES FOR THUS THEY RAN FULL FATHOM FIVE THY FATHER LIES
THE SULTAN EXPECTS YOUR ANSWER IMMEDIATELY SAID SHE
BUT MY GOOD MASTER BATES DYING IN TWO YEARS AFTER AND I HAVING FEW FRIENDS MY BUSINESS BEGAN TO FAIL
BUT THIS EVENT DID NOT HAPPEN
HE THEN PLACED ME SOFTLY ON THE GROUND ON ALL FOURS BUT I IMMEDIATELY GOT UP AND WALKED SLOWLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD TO LET THOSE PEOPLE SEE I HAD NO INTENT TO RUN AWAY
SO HE GAVE HIM HIS HAND AND HE DREW HIM OUT AND SET HIM UPON SOUND GROUND AND BID HIM GO ON HIS WAY
FOR ALTHOUGH HE SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE TAKEN SO ILL A MAN INTO HIS SHIP YET HE WOULD ENGAGE HIS WORD TO SET ME SAFE ASHORE IN THE FIRST PORT WHERE WE ARRIVED
THE KING OF THE INDIES BEFORE WHOM MARCH ONE HUNDRED ELEPHANTS WHO LIVES IN A PALACE THAT SHINES WITH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RUBIES AND WHO HAS IN HIS TREASURY TWENTY THOUSAND CROWNS ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS TO CALIPH HAROUN-AL-RASCHID
THOSE IN THE CAVE WE WERE SURE COULD NOT HEAR
I AFTERWARDS FOUND TO MY GREAT CONSOLATION THAT THIS FELLOW WAS A MOST DETESTABLE CHARACTER ALWAYS KEEPING THE PRODUCE OF HIS GROUNDS FOR EXTRAVAGANT MARKETS
AND CONFESS THAT YOUR EYES NEVER BEHELD JEWELS SO RICH AND BEAUTIFUL BEFORE THE VIZIER WAS CHARMED
WE TREMBLED AT THIS SPECTACLE AND WERE SEIZED WITH DEADLY APPREHENSION WHEN SUDDENLY THE GATE OF THE APARTMENT OPENED WITH A LOUD CRASH AND THERE CAME OUT THE HORRIBLE FIGURE OF A BLACK MAN AS TALL AS A LOFTY PALM TREE
WHEREUPON I MADE A SIGN THAT HE SHOULD PLACE HIS HAND ON THE GROUND
WILFRED OF IVANHOE IS WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND WILL PERISH IN THE BURNING CASTLE WITHOUT PRESENT HELP WILFRED OF IVANHOE EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT--"PRISONER AND PERISH
BUT I RECEIVED NO OTHER HURT AND THE DWARF WAS PARDONED AT MY DESIRE BECAUSE I HAD GIVEN THE PROVOCATION
THERE WAS A YOUNG ROC IN IT JUST READY TO BE HATCHED AND ITS BEAK HAD BEGUN TO BREAK THE EGG
I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION WHICH IS THE PLACE OF ALL EVIL AND AM GOING TO THE CITY OF ZION
I HAVE GRIEVED THE SPIRIT AND HE IS GONE
SUCH HOWEVER WAS THE CROWD AND CONFUSION THAT DURING THE EARLIER PART OF THE CONFLICT THEIR EFFORTS TO MEET WERE UNAVAILING
SHOULD ATHELSTANE OF CONINGSBURGH OBTAIN THE PRIZE IVANHOE IS LIKE TO HEAR EVIL TIDINGS WHEN HE REACHES ENGLAND FINDING THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER INFORMATION TO BE OBTAINED ABOUT THE KNIGHT IN WHOSE FATE SHE SEEMED TO TAKE SO DEEP AN INTEREST SHE BADE HER MAIDENS TO OFFER THE SLEEPING-CUP TO THE HOLY MAN AND HAVING PRESENTED HIM WITH A PIECE OF GOLD WISHED HIM GOOD NIGHT
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME COME AGAIN ALADDIN'S MOTHER RETURNED HOME MUCH MORE GRATIFIED THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND TOLD HER SON WITH MUCH JOY THE CONDESCENDING ANSWER SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE SULTAN'S OWN MOUTH
WHEN THE PRINCE APPEARS IN PUBLIC HE HAS A THRONE FIXED ON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT AND RIDES BETWEEN TWO RANKS OF HIS MINISTERS FAVORITES AND OTHER PEOPLE OF HIS COURT
THE OLD MAN PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH THIS HAD UPON ME AND THAT I CARRIED HIM WITH MORE EASE THAN BEFORE MADE ME A SIGN TO GIVE HIM SOME OF IT
YOU WILL TREAT ME REPLIED I WITH MORE CIVILITY WHEN YOU KNOW ME BETTER
THE SLAVE PICKED OUT ONE AND CARRIED IT TO THE PRINCESS
HE WADED NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN HIS KNEES AND TOOK PRODIGIOUS STRIDES
AND LOOKING OVER THE CHARTS OF THE SEA-COAST OF AMERICA WITH HIM WE CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO INHABITED COUNTRY FOR US TO HAVE RECOURSE TO TILL WE CAME WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THE CARIBBEE ISLANDS AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO STAND AWAY FOR BARBADOES
THE MALEFACTOR WAS FIXED ON A CHAIR UPON A SCAFFOLD ERECTED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HIS HEAD CUT OFF AT ONE BLOW WITH A SWORD OF ABOUT FORTY FEET LONG
THE LORDS WHO HAD COURTED HIM IN THE DAYS OF HIS SPLENDOR NOW DECLINED TO HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION WITH HIM
WHEN THE STORM WAS OVER WE SET FORESAIL AND MAINSAIL AND BROUGHT THE SHIP TO
BESIDES I NOW CONSIDERED MYSELF AS BOUND BY THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY TO A PEOPLE WHO HAD TREATED ME WITH SO MUCH EXPENSE AND MAGNIFICENCE
HENCE HE EMPLOYED YOUNG ALADDIN AND HOPED BY A MIXTURE OF KINDNESS AND AUTHORITY TO MAKE HIM OBEDIENT TO HIS WORD AND WILL
WE FOUND EXCELLENT FRUIT WHICH AFFORDED US GREAT RELIEF AND RECRUITED OUR STRENGTH
THEN I CALLED A COUNCIL--THAT IS TO SAY IN MY THOUGHTS--WHETHER I SHOULD TAKE BACK THE RAFT
AND IF THEY COME INTO IT WHEN A LAND WIND BLOWS WHICH MIGHT SEEM TO FAVOR THEIR GETTING OUT AGAIN THE HEIGHT OF THE MOUNTAIN STOPS THE WIND AND OCCASIONS A CALM SO THAT THE FORCE OF THE CURRENT CARRIES THEM ASHORE
IN ALL THIS CONFUSION I QUITE FORGOT MY SETTER AS NO DOUBT YOU ALSO HAVE
I CONSIDERED THAT THIS WAS THE STATION OF LIFE THE INFINITELY WISE AND GOOD PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD DETERMINED FOR ME
WHICH ALADDIN OBSERVING HE SNATCHED THE WEAPON FROM HIS HAND PIERCED HIM TO THE HEART WITH HIS OWN DAGGER AND THEN PUSHED HIM DOWN ON THE FLOOR
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
YOU WILL BE REWARDED MY SON IN TIME I WENT ON
I AM ARMED AND WELL PREPARED THE COURT AWARDS YOU A POUND OF ANTONIO'S FLESH SAID PORTIA TO THE MONEY-LENDER
IN A WORD THERE WAS NOT A PERSON MORE IN FAVOR WITH HIM THAN MYSELF AND CONSEQUENTLY EVERY MAN IN COURT AND CITY SOUGHT TO OBLIGE ME SO THAT IN A VERY LITTLE TIME I WAS LOOKED UPON RATHER AS A NATIVE THAN A STRANGER
THE DARK SHALL BE LIGHT AND THE WRONG MADE RIGHT WHEN BERTRAM'S RIGHT AND BERTRAM'S MIGHT SHALL MEET ON BUT ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT RECALL THE END OF THE LAST LINE GLOSSIN THOUGHT HE KNEW ALREADY A GOOD DEAL TOO MUCH ABOUT IT
MUCH MORE THEN ARE WE FORBIDDEN TO TAKE HIS COUNSEL TO KILL OURSELVES
TELL ME FREELY WHAT YOU THINK OF MY PROPOSAL
BUT TO SEE WITH WHAT FEAR I WENT FORWARD HOW OFTEN I LOOKED BEHIND ME HOW I WAS READY EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LAY DOWN MY BASKET AND RUN FOR MY LIFE IT WOULD HAVE MADE ANY ONE HAVE THOUGHT I WAS HAUNTED WITH AN EVIL CONSCIENCE OR THAT I HAD BEEN LATELY MOST TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
AT EACH END OF THE ENCLOSURE TWO HERALDS WERE STATIONED AND A STRONG BODY OF MEN-AT-ARMS FOR MAINTAINING ORDER AND ASCERTAINING THE QUALITY OF THE KNIGHTS WHO PROPOSED TO ENGAGE IN THE CONTEST
BY N AND LEAVING THOSE ISLES ON THE EAST
THE PARALLEL STICKS SECURED THEM AND THEIR HORSES FROM FALLING OVER THE STAGE
THIS I DID INDEED WITHOUT FIRE BY MERE MALLET AND CHISEL AND BY THE DINT OF HARD LABOR TILL I HAD BROUGHT IT TO BE A VERY HANDSOME PERIAGUA AND BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE CARRIED SIX-AND TWENTY MEN AND CONSEQUENTLY BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE CARRIED ME AND ALL MY CARGO
AND WITHAL THE OLD GIANT WONDERED THAT HE COULD NEITHER BY HIS BLOWS NOR COUNSEL BRING THEM TO AN END
LOOK THAT YOUR BRAW CRADLE AT HOME BE THE FAIRER SPREAD UP
I WAS THE THIRD OF FIVE SONS
AS THEY ENTERED THE APARTMENT WHERE CEDRIC SAT IVANHOE MUFFLED HIS FACE IN HIS MANTLE
HAD I USED HALF AS MUCH PRUDENCE TO HAVE LOOKED INTO MY OWN INTEREST AND HAVE MADE A JUDGMENT OF WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE I HAD CERTAINLY NEVER GONE AWAY FROM SO PROSPEROUS AN UNDERTAKING AND GONE UPON A VOYAGE TO SEA ATTENDED WITH ALL ITS HAZARDS
IN A WORD I GAVE THEM EVERY PART OF MY OWN STORY
UPON WHICH THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED
I WAS LOATH TO FIRE BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE THE REST HEAR
THEREFORE THOUGH HE COULD HAVE WISHED ALI BABA WOULD HAVE DECLINED THE DANCE HE PRETENDED TO BE OBLIGED TO HIM FOR IT AND HAD THE COMPLAISANCE TO EXPRESS HIS SATISFACTION AT WHAT HE SAW WHICH PLEASED HIS HOST
BUT NOT AT ALL CONSIDERING THE PARTICULAR INCONVENIENCE WHICH I LAY UNDER MORE THAN THE INDIANS DID VIZ WANT OF HANDS TO MOVE IT WHEN IT WAS MADE INTO THE WATER--A DIFFICULTY MUCH HARDER FOR ME TO SURMOUNT THAN ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF WANT OF TOOLS COULD BE TO THEM
BUT ON THIS CONDITION THAT IN THREE DAYS THOU SHALT LEAVE ENGLAND AND THAT THOU WILT NEVER MENTION THE NAME OF JOHN OF ANJOU AS CONNECTED WITH THY FELONY THEN TURNING TO WHERE THE YEOMEN STOOD APART HE SAID LET THIS KNIGHT HAVE A STEED LOCKSLEY AND LET HIM DEPART UNHARMED
WHERE AFTER CROSSING PLAINS RIVERS MOUNTAINS DESERTS AND A LONG TRACT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT DELAY HE ARRIVED AFTER INCREDIBLE FATIGUES
WE CONTINUED UPON THE SHORE AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN IN A STATE OF DESPAIR AND EXPECTED DEATH EVERY DAY
THEREFORE DESIGNED TO MAKE MY ESCAPE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY AND TO RETURN TO BAGDAD WHICH MY PRESENT SETTLEMENT HOW ADVANTAGEOUS SOEVER COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET
AND WHEN THEY RODE UP TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE THEY CAME THEY WERE SURPRISED TO FIND A HORSE-LITTER PLACED UPON THE GROUND BESIDE WHICH SAT A YOUNG WOMAN RICHLY DRESSED IN THE JEWISH FASHION WHILE AN OLD MAN WHOSE YELLOW CAP PROCLAIMED HIM TO BELONG TO THE SAME NATION WALKED UP AND DOWN WRINGING HIS HANDS AS IF AFFECTED BY SOME STRANGE DISASTER
I TOLD HIM I HAD LIKEWISE OBSERVED ANOTHER THING THAT WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO THE SHIP AND THE SAILORS STOOD ALL ABOUT ME I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE LITTLE CREATURES I HAD EVER BEHELD
UPON THIS THEY APPEARED VERY THANKFUL AND I ACCORDINGLY SET THEM AT LIBERTY AND BADE THEM RETIRE INTO THE WOODS TO THE PLACE WHENCE THEY CAME AND I WOULD LEAVE THEM SOME FIRE-ARMS SOME AMMUNITION AND SOME DIRECTIONS HOW THEY SHOULD LIVE VERY WELL IF THEY THOUGHT FIT
WHEN MORGIANA SAW HIM DEPART SHE WENT TO BED SATISFIED AND PLEASED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SO WELL IN SAVING HER MASTER AND FAMILY
HE BLEW MY HAIR ASIDE TO TAKE A BETTER VIEW OF MY FACE
ONE DAY WE WERE BECALMED NEAR A SMALL ISLAND BUT LITTLE ELEVATED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER AND RESEMBLING A GREEN MEADOW
DIRCK HATTERAICK HE WHISPERED
WHEN HE ESPIED ME HE CAME RUNNING TO ME LAYING HIMSELF DOWN AGAIN UPON THE GROUND WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE SIGNS OF AN HUMBLE THANKFUL DISPOSITION MAKING A GREAT MANY ANTIC GESTURES TO SHOW IT
AND AFTER THAT THEY SHUT UP THE GATES
THEN I HEARD IN MY DREAM THAT ALL THE BELLS IN THE CITY RANG AGAIN FOR JOY AND THAT IT WAS SAID UNTO THEM ENTER YE INTO THE JOY OF YOUR LORD
BUT THE CREATURES RAN OFF A SECOND TIME BEFORE I COULD SEIZE THEM
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THREW UP STONES HOPING TO DRIVE THE MONKEY DOWN
WE ALLOW HIM VANQUISHED HE DESCENDED INTO THE LISTS AND COMMANDED THEM TO UNHELM THE CONQUERED CHAMPION
SHE HAD COME SHE SAID TO PAY THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WHICH SHE OWED TO WILFRED AND TO ASK HIS WIFE TO TRANSMIT TO HIM HER GRATEFUL FAREWELL
HE DETERMINED HOWEVER TO AVENGE THE FATE OF HIS COMPANIONS AND TO ACCOMPLISH THE DEATH OF ALI BABA
THE DECLIVITY WAS SO SMALL THAT I WALKED NEAR A MILE BEFORE I GOT TO THE SHORE WHICH I CONJECTURED WAS ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
NINE HUNDRED OF THE STRONGEST MEN WERE EMPLOYED TO DRAW UP THESE CORDS BY MANY PULLEYS FASTENED ON THE POLES AND THUS IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS I WAS RAISED AND FLUNG INTO THE ENGINE AND THERE TIED FAST
HOWEVER AS WELL AS I COULD I BARRICADED MYSELF ROUND WITH THE CHESTS AND BOARDS THAT I HAD BROUGHT ON SHORE AND MADE A KIND OF HUT FOR THAT NIGHT'S LODGING
IN THE FIRST PLACE I WAS REMOVED FROM ALL THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WORLD HERE
BY THE MEANS OF WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT THE DEVIL CAN DO THE SOULS OF HIS PEOPLE PROVE GRACIOUS STILL
BEING QUITE DISPIRITED WITH TOIL AND WHOLLY OVERCOME BY GRIEF AND DESPAIR I LAY DOWN BETWEEN TWO RIDGES AND HEARTILY WISHED I MIGHT THERE END MY DAYS
THE BOATSWAIN IS KILLED
THE KING OF THE ISLE OF KELA IS VERY RICH AND POWERFUL AND THE ISLE OF BELLS WHICH IS ABOUT TWO DAYS JOURNEY IN EXTENT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO HIM
I WAKED WITH THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ASCENDED THE LADDERS TO BEGIN AT THE TOP AND GOT UP TOTALLY IGNORANT OF MY SITUATION
THESE TREES HAVING BEEN PLANTED SO THICK BEFORE THEY WANTED BUT FEW PILES TO BE DRIVEN BETWEEN THEM THAT THEY MIGHT BE THICKER AND STRONGER AND MY WALL WOULD BE SOON FINISHED
HELENA HAD BEEN DEMETRIUS'S SWEETHEART LONG BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE WITH HERMIA HAD BEEN THOUGHT OF AND BEING VERY SILLY LIKE ALL JEALOUS PEOPLE SHE COULD NOT SEE THAT IT WAS NOT POOR HERMIA'S FAULT THAT DEMETRIUS WISHED TO MARRY HER INSTEAD OF HIS OWN LADY HELENA
FOR BY CONTENDING TO EXCEL THEMSELVES AND THEIR FELLOWS THEY STRAIN SO FAR THAT THERE IS HARDLY ONE OF THEM WHO HAS NOT RECEIVED A FALL AND SOME OF THEM TWO OR THREE
IT SEEMS UPON MY FIRST REACHING THE SHORE AFTER OUR SHIPWRECK I WAS IN SUCH CONFUSION THAT BEFORE I CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE I WENT TO SLEEP MY HAT WHICH I HAD FASTENED WITH A STRING TO MY HEAD WHILE I WAS ROWING AND HAD STUCK ON ALL THE TIME I WAS SWIMMING FELL OFF AFTER I CAME TO LAND
AND WE COULD SEE THEM PLAINLY THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PERCEIVE US
IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THESE AMBASSADORS SPOKE TO ME BY AN INTERPRETER THE LANGUAGES OF BOTH EMPIRES DIFFERING AS MUCH FROM EACH OTHER AS ANY TWO IN EUROPE AND EACH NATION PRIDING ITSELF UPON THE ANTIQUITY BEAUTY AND ENERGY OF THEIR OWN TONGUES WITH AN AVOWED CONTEMPT FOR THAT OF THEIR NEIGHBOR
BUT THE POOR GARDENER WHO KNEW ME WELL AND HAD A GREAT KINDNESS FOR ME WAS IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
I LIKEWISE TAUGHT HIM TO SAY YES AND NO AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THEM
A SUDDEN CHANGE OF WEATHER HAD TAKEN PLACE
OVER AGAINST THIS TEMPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT HIGHWAY AT TWENTY FEET DISTANCE THERE WAS A TURRET AT LEAST FIVE FEET HIGH
SIRE SAID ALADDIN THOUGH GREAT IS MY IMPATIENCE TO ENTER ON THE HONOR GRANTED ME BY YOUR MAJESTY YET I BEG YOU TO PERMIT ME FIRST TO BUILD A PALACE WORTHY TO RECEIVE THE PRINCESS YOUR DAUGHTER
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE DRAGOONS WERE ENGAGED WITH THE RIOTERS
AS SOON AS I CAME ON BOARD THE MERCHANTS AND SEAMEN FLOCKED ABOUT ME TO KNOW HOW I CAME INTO THAT DESERT ISLAND
GIVEN AT OUR PALACE AT BELFABORAC THE TWELFTH DAY OF THE NINETY-FIRST MOON OF OUR REIGN
BUT WITHOUT ADVERTING TO THE LITTLE FRATERNAL AFFECTION HE HAD SHOWN FOR HIM WENT INTO THE CAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO ENSHROUD HIS REMAINS
AND HE WAS JUST SAYING TO HIS COMPANION THAT THE WHOLE RUIN SHOULD BE PULLED DOWN WHEN BERTRAM MET HIM AND SAID
BEFORE LONG A STEP WAS HEARD ON THE STAIR AND THE DOOR OF THE TURRET-CHAMBER SLOWLY OPENED AND BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT ENTERED THE ROOM
YET THERE WAS SUCH AN EXQUISITE MIXTURE OF COURAGE AND RESIGNATION IN HER LOOK THAT EVEN IN THIS GARB AND WITH NO OTHER ORNAMENT THAN HER LONG BLACK TRESSES EACH EYE WEPT THAT LOOKED UPON HER
OBERON WAS VERY SORRY TO SEE HIS KIND SCHEME TO HELP THESE LOVERS TURN OUT SO BADLY
TAKE CAPTIVE BUT SAVE LIFE
BEHIND HIM CAME BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT ARMED CAP-A-PIE IN BRIGHT ARMOUR BUT LOOKING GHASTLY PALE
AND AS SUCH HE LOOKED UPON HIM AS HIS OWN ENEMY
FURNISH ALSO TWENTY SLAVES AS RICHLY CLOTHED AS THOSE WHO CARRIED THE PRESENT TO THE SULTAN TO WALK BY MY SIDE AND FOLLOW ME AND TWENTY MORE TO GO BEFORE ME IN TWO RANKS
IN A LITTLE TIME I FELT SOMETHING ALIVE MOVING ON MY LEFT LEG WHICH ADVANCING GENTLY FORWARD OVER MY BREAST CAME ALMOST UP TO MY CHIN
AND HEAVING ANCHOR THE WIND BEING FAVORABLE I STEERED THE SAME COURSE THAT I HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE WHEREIN I WAS DIRECTED BY MY POCKET COMPASS
I EXPECT AS MUCH REPLIED CASSIM HAUGHTILY
GENIE SAID ALADDIN I COMMAND THEE TO TRANSPORT THIS PALACE INSTANTLY TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE IT WAS BROUGHT HITHER THE GENIE BOWED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF OBEDIENCE AND DISAPPEARED
AS HE WANDERED HOME AGAIN FILLED WITH GLOOMY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE DAY OF KENNEDY'S MURDER HIS STEPS BORE HIM TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF DERNCLEUGH WITH ITS RUINED REMAINS OF THE OLD GIPSY VILLAGE
AND YET THOUGH I GAVE OVER THE HOPES OF THE BOAT MY DESIRE TO VENTURE OVER TO THE MAINLAND INCREASED RATHER THAN DECREASED AS THE MEANS FOR IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
BUT WHILE HE WAS PUTTING HIS HAND INTO IT MORGIANA WITH A COURAGE AND RESOLUTION WORTHY OF HERSELF PLUNGED THE PONIARD INTO HIS HEART
SO THAT BY THIS STRATAGEM WE FILLED OUR BAGS WITH COCOANUTS
WHEN IN AN INSTANT I FELT ABOVE AN HUNDRED ARROWS DISCHARGED ON MY LEFT HAND WHICH PRICKED ME LIKE SO MANY NEEDLES
I THEN FOUND MYSELF HOISTED UP BY DEGREES AT LEAST THREE FEET HIGHER THAN I WAS BEFORE
AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE SAW THE HOLY WOMAN AS THEY IMAGINED HIM TO BE THEY PRESENTLY GATHERED ABOUT HIM IN A GREAT CROWD
FROM THENCE WE WENT TO THE ISLE OF COMARI WHERE THE BEST SPECIES OF WOOD OF ALOES GROWS
I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND SUPPLY MY WANTS AND WHAT WAS ALL THE REST TO ME
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS AT WHICH THE INTERPRETER BID HIM TALK WITH THE MAN
SIR HERE IS A TRAVELLER WHO WAS BID BY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF THE GOOD MAN OF THIS HOUSE TO CALL HERE FOR MY PROFIT
THIS IS A LAW IN THIS ISLAND
THEN HE ASKED HER ALSO WHAT HE HAD BEST DO FURTHER TO THEM
THAT THEY HUMBLY CONCEIVED IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING BELONGING TO THE MAN-MOUNTAIN
THUS ALL WAS MADE PLAIN AND STRAIGHT AGAIN
WHILE OTHER WITNESSES TESTIFIED TO THE APPARENT MADNESS OF THE TEMPLAR IN BRINGING THE JEWESS TO THE PRECEPTORY
THE SULTAN ASKED THEM IF ALADDIN HAD GIVEN THEM ANY REASON FOR SO DOING AND THEY ANSWERING THAT HE HAD GIVEN THEM NONE HE ORDERED A HORSE TO BE BROUGHT WHICH HE MOUNTED AND RODE TO HIS SON-IN-LAW'S PALACE WITH SOME FEW ATTENDANTS ON FOOT TO INQUIRE WHY HE HAD ORDERED THE COMPLETION OF THE WINDOW TO BE STOPPED
BY AN OBSERVATION WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE LATITUDE OF 30 DEGREES 2 MINUTES SOUTH
THE SPELL OF THE LOVE-JUICE WAS ON HER AND TO HER THE CLOWN SEEMED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND DELIGHTFUL CREATURE ON ALL THE EARTH
AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH CHRISTIAN WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED
ALL EYES TURNED TO THE TEMPLAR
CASSIM AFTER HE HAD MARRIED THE RICH WIDOW HAD NEVER TREATED ALI BABA AS A BROTHER BUT NEGLECTED HIM
AND LUCY BERTRAM AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRED UPON YOUNG HAZLEWOOD
THESE I SECURED FIRST WITH SOME POWDER-HORNS AND A SMALL BAG OF SHOT AND TWO OLD RUSTY SWORDS
THE JUICE OF THAT LITTLE PURPLE FLOWER LAID ON THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SLEEP WILL MAKE THEM WHEN THEY WAKE TO LOVE THE FIRST THING THEY SEE
BABA MUSTAPHA WAS SEATED WITH AN AWL IN HIS HAND JUST GOING TO WORK
THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY WAS THEN POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER THE FUNERAL
BENEATH AN ENORMOUS OAK-TREE SEVERAL YEOMEN LAY STRETCHED ON THE GROUND WHILE ANOTHER AS SENTINEL WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE MOONLIGHT SHADE
ON ALADDIN'S ARRIVAL AT THE PALACE THE SULTAN WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HIM MORE RICHLY AND MAGNIFICENTLY ROBED THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN HIMSELF AND WAS IMPRESSED WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS AND DIGNITY OF MANNER WHICH WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE EXPECTED IN THE SON OF ONE SO HUMBLE AS ALADDIN'S MOTHER
FOR THERE IS NOT A PERSON WHO IS DISEASED BUT SHE PUTS HER HAND ON THEM AND CURES THEM HAVING ASCERTAINED THE PLACE WHERE THE HERMITAGE OF THE HOLY WOMAN WAS THE MAGICIAN WENT AT NIGHT AND PLUNGING A PONIARD INTO HER HEART--KILLED THIS GOOD WOMAN
AT LENGTH VERY UNEASY I WENT BACK AND WHEN I WAS HALF-WAY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HAD LEFT MY WIFE I HEARD LAMENTABLE GROANS
I SHALL APPEAR IN THE LISTS AGAINST THY CHAMPION AND KNOW THAT THERE LIVES NOT THE KNIGHT WHO MAY COPE WITH ME ALONE SAVE RICHARD COEUR-DE-LION AND HIS MINION IVANHOE
I BLESS THE DAY ON WHICH I SEE YOU ONCE MORE I MADE MY COMPLIMENTS TO HIM AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS KINDNESS AND DELIVERED THE GIFTS FROM MY AUGUST MASTER
IT WILL HAVE DAWNED UPON THE READER BEFORE NOW THAT THE YOUNG SOLDIER KNOWN TO HIM AS BROWN WAS IN REALITY NO OTHER THAN THE HARRY BERTRAM WHO HAD DISAPPEARED ON THE DAY WHEN KENNEDY WAS MURDERED
WE HAD UPON THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE BOAT'S COMING FROM THE SHIP CONSIDERED OF SEPARATING OUR PRISONERS
BESIDES THESE THINGS I TOOK ALL THE MEN'S CLOTHES THAT I COULD FIND AND A SPARE FORE-TOPSAIL A HAMMOCK AND SOME BEDDING AND WITH THIS I LOADED MY SECOND RAFT AND BROUGHT THEM ALL SAFE ON SHORE TO MY VERY GREAT COMFORT
THE FATHER COMPLIED AND THE LAD TOOK HIS SEAT AGAIN WHEREUPON I WENT TO HIM AND KISSED HIS HAND WHICH MY MASTER TOOK AND MADE HIM STROKE ME GENTLY WITH IT
HE DID SO IN THE COURSE OF THAT EVENING AND SHORTLY AFTER HE ENTERED THE PRINCESS THUS ADDRESSED HIM
WITH THIS DESIGN WE CHANGED OUR COURSE AND STEERED AWAY N.W
I AM GOING TO SLEEP THEN SAID THE QUEEN AND I WILL WIND THEE IN MY ARMS AND SO WHEN OBERON CAME ALONG HE FOUND HIS BEAUTIFUL QUEEN LAVISHING KISSES AND ENDEARMENTS ON A CLOWN WITH A DONKEY'S HEAD
HINDBAD PUT ON HIS BEST ROBE NEXT DAY AND RETURNED TO THE BOUNTIFUL TRAVELLER WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH A PLEASANT AIR AND WELCOMED HIM HEARTILY
BUT IT IS IN THE NAME OF ONE DEAR TO MANY AND DEAR EVEN TO YOU THAT I BESEECH YOU TO LET THIS SICK PERSON BE TRANSPORTED WITH CARE AND TENDERNESS UNDER YOUR PROTECTION SO NOBLE AND SOLEMN WAS THE AIR WITH WHICH REBECCA MADE THIS APPEAL THAT ON THE INTERCESSION OF ROWENA CEDRIC READILY CONSENTED TO ALLOW THE JEW AND HIS DAUGHTER TOGETHER WITH THEIR SICK FRIEND TO ATTACH THEMSELVES TO HIS PARTY
HE HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED ON THE PREVIOUS DAY BY ANOTHER NOBLE SAXON ATHELSTANE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH A SUITOR FOR THE HAND OF ROWENA AND ONE WHO CONSIDERED HIS UNION WITH THAT LADY AS A MATTER ALREADY FIXED BEYOND DOUBT BY THE ASSENT OF CEDRIC AND HER OTHER FRIENDS
SO THAT HE FOUND HE WAS GOTTEN UPON THE COAST OF GUIANA OR THE NORTH PART OF BRAZIL BEYOND THE RIVER AMAZON TOWARD THAT OF THE RIVER ORINOCO COMMONLY CALLED THE GREAT RIVER
DO NOT BE AFRAID SAID MORGIANA THE MAN YOU SEE THERE CAN NEITHER DO YOU NOR ANYBODY ELSE ANY HARM
MIND AND TELL ME WHAT HAS BECOME OF IT ALADDIN DID SO AND BEING UTTERLY AMAZED AT THE LOSS OF HIS PALACE WAS SPEECHLESS
YET I CAN TELL THEE SOMETHING THOU LACKEST SAID ISAAC AND IT MAY BE SUPPLY IT TOO
A CHAMPION AND AMIDST A RINGING CHEER THE KNIGHT RODE INTO THE TILT-YARD ALTHOUGH HIS HORSE APPEARED TO REEL FROM FATIGUE
AT LAST RECOVERING HIMSELF HE SAID
WHICH AS OUR SCOUTS ASSURED US LAY AT ANCHOR IN THE HARBOR READY TO SAIL WITH THE FIRST FAIR WIND
ONE IS THAT YOU WILL NEVER SPEAK OF WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN THIS NIGHT
BERTRAM HOWEVER SUCCEEDED IN PROCURING FROM HIM THE LUXURY OF A SEPARATE ROOM BY PROMISING THE KEEPER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
I HAVE PLACED THE FIREWOOD SO AS TO SCREEN YOU
WHY SAID I IT IS THAT AS YOU SAY THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR HONEST FELLOWS AMONG THEM WHICH SHOULD BE SPARED
THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WORE AN ASPECT OF THE MOST PROFOUND GRAVITY THE REFLECTION AS IT WERE OF THE SOMBRE COUNTENANCE OF THE AUSTERE AND RELENTLESS GRAND MASTER
AND IN MY WAY HITHER I HAVE THOUGHT HOW TO PUT IT INTO EXECUTION BUT IF ANY ONE CAN FORM A BETTER EXPEDIENT LET HIM COMMUNICATE IT HE THEN TOLD THEM HIS CONTRIVANCE
WHEREUPON I AGAIN THRUST UP MY STICK AND HANDKERCHIEF CALLING FOR HELP TILL I WAS ALMOST HOARSE
HE THEN KINDLED A GREAT FIRE ROASTED AND ATE HIM IN HIS APARTMENT FOR HIS SUPPER
YOU MUST BE MAD TO TALK THUS I ASSURE YOU MOTHER REPLIED ALADDIN THAT I AM NOT MAD BUT IN MY RIGHT SENSES
I HEARD THEN A VOICE SAYING ARISE YE DEAD AND COME TO JUDGMENT
SOON THE SLOW AND SULLEN SOUNDS OF THE GREAT CHURCH BELL CHILLED WITH AWE THE HEARTS OF THE ASSEMBLED CROWD
WHEN HE WAS COME UP TO THE GATE HE LOOKED UP TO THE WRITING THAT WAS ABOVE AND THEN BEGAN TO KNOCK SUPPOSING THAT ENTRANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUICKLY ADMINISTERED TO HIM
THOU HAST HITHERTO OBEYED ME
ARIEL GAVE THEM CALM SEAS AND AUSPICIOUS GALES
AND IMITATING THE SOLEMN AND STATELY DEPORTMENT OF A FRIAR HE DEPARTED TO EXECUTE HIS MISSION
GET THY WOUNDS HEALED HA
OBERON STOPPED OVER HER AND LAID THE JUICE ON HER EYES SAYING WHAT THOU SEEST WHEN THOU WAKE DO IT FOR THY TRUE LOVE TAKE NOW IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN TITANIA WOKE THE FIRST THING SHE SAW WAS A STUPID CLOWN ONE OF A PARTY OF PLAYERS WHO HAD COME OUT INTO THE WOOD TO REHEARSE THEIR PLAY
AND INDEED I WAS GLAD NOT TO HAVE BEEN A SPECTATOR OF THE HAVOC THEY MADE
THEN RUN IN ON HIM TAKE HIS ARMS AND BIND HIM TIGHT AND HAVING SAID SO SHE CREPT IN UPON HER HANDS AND KNEES FOLLOWED BY BERTRAM AND HIS FRIEND
HE THEN COMMANDED HIS MEN TO ROW UP TO THAT SIDE AND FASTENING A CABLE TO ONE OF THE STAPLES ORDERED THEM TO TOW MY CHEST AS THEY CALLED IT TOWARD THE SHIP
THERE ARE YOUR GOODS WHICH I ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO PRESERVE I TOOK THEM FROM HIM AND MADE HIM MY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR HIS CARE OF THEM
THOUGH I FORESAW NOTHING AT THAT TIME MORE THAN MY MERE FEAR SUGGESTED TO ME
HOWEVER I WENT TO THE WOODS AND CUT LEVERS AND ROLLERS AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE BOAT RESOLVING TO TRY WHAT I COULD DO
I TOOK NINE OF THESE STICKS AND FIXING THEM FIRMLY IN THE GROUND IN A QUADRANGULAR FIGURE TWO FEET AND A HALF SQUARE I TOOK FOUR OTHER STICKS AND TIED THEM PARALLEL AT EACH CORNER ABOUT TWO FEET FROM THE GROUND
HERE IS ALSO A SORT OF FOUNTAIN OF PITCH OR BITUMEN THAT RUNS INTO THE SEA WHICH THE FISH SWALLOW AND EVACUATE SOON AFTERWARD TURNED INTO AMBERGRIS
WIFE REPLIED ALI BABA YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU UNDERTAKE WHEN YOU PRETEND TO COUNT THE MONEY
WE STAYED ALL NIGHT NEAR THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD BEEN CAST ASHORE
BOTH THESE THINGS FILLED MY HEAD WITH NEW IMAGINATIONS AND GAVE ME THE VAPORS AGAIN TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE SO THAT I SHOOK WITH COLD LIKE ONE IN AN AGUE
THAT HE LAUGHED AT THEIR FOLLY AND WENT HIMSELF IN THE BOAT ORDERING HIS MEN TO TAKE A STRONG CABLE ALONG WITH THEM
GOLBASTO MOMAREM EVLAME GURDILO SHEFIN MULLY ULLY GUE MOST MIGHTY EMPEROR OF LILLIPUT DELIGHT AND TERROR OF THE UNIVERSE WHOSE DOMINIONS EXTEND FIVE THOUSAND BLUSTRUGS ABOUT TWELVE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE GLOBE
BROWN QUICKENED HIS PACE AND SOON CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE SUBJECT OF THE TERRIER'S ALARM
AND AS FOR THE ILL END THOU SAYEST THEY COME TO THAT IS MOST GLORIOUS IN THEIR ACCOUNT
IT WILL BE TROUBLESOME TO YOU INDEED UNCLE ANSWERED ALADDIN I CANNOT NOW BUT I WILL AS SOON AS I AM UP THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WAS DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE LAMP BEFORE HE WOULD HELP HIM UP
WE PREPARED IMMEDIATELY TO SAIL BUT DID NOT WEIGH THAT NIGHT
AND LET THEM THAT COME AFTER HAVE A CARE LEST HEEDLESSNESS MAKES THEM AS WE TO FARE
AS HE ENTERED THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ON THE OUTSIDE
AFTER SOME TIME WE COULD SEE THEM BY THE LITTLE LIGHT THERE WAS RUN ABOUT WRINGING THEIR HANDS LIKE MEN IN DESPAIR AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD GO AND SIT DOWN IN THE BOAT TO REST THEMSELVES THEN COME ASHORE AGAIN AND WALK ABOUT AGAIN AND SO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN
WHEREFORE AT LAST LIGHTING UNDER A LITTLE SHELTER THEY SAT DOWN THERE TILL THE DAY BRAKE
FOLLOW ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE SULTAN THEN TOOK ALADDIN INTO THE APARTMENT FROM WHENCE HE WAS WONT TO LOOK AT AND ADMIRE HIS PALACE AND SAID YOU OUGHT TO KNOW WHERE YOUR PALACE STOOD
AND A LITTLE AFTER THE WATER STILL RISING MY RAFT FLOATED AGAIN AND I THRUST HER OFF WITH THE OAR I HAD INTO THE CHANNEL AND THEN DRIVING UP HIGHER I AT LENGTH FOUND MYSELF IN THE MOUTH OF A LITTLE RIVER WITH LAND ON BOTH SIDES AND A STRONG CURRENT OF TIDE RUNNING UP
WHEN THE SULTAN'S PORTERS CAME TO OPEN THE GATES THEY WERE AMAZED TO FIND WHAT HAD BEEN AN UNOCCUPIED GARDEN FILLED UP WITH A MAGNIFICENT PALACE AND A SPLENDID CARPET EXTENDING TO IT ALL THE WAY FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE
HOW REPLIED ONE OF THEM DO YOU LIVE IN BAGDAD AND KNOW NOT THAT THIS IS THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SAILOR THAT FAMOUS VOYAGER WHO HAS SAILED ROUND THE WORLD THE PORTER LIFTED UP HIS EYES TO HEAVEN AND SAID LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALMIGHTY CREATOR OF ALL THINGS CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINDBAD AND ME
AND TWICE MORE I WAS LIFTED UP BY THE WAVES AND CARRIED FORWARD AS BEFORE THE SHORE BEING VERY FLAT
THE MAGICIAN WOULD NOT LET HIM GO BY HIMSELF BUT CONDUCTED HIM TO HIS MOTHER WHO AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM SO WELL DRESSED WAS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY AND BESTOWED A THOUSAND BLESSINGS UPON THE MAGICIAN
WE DESIRE THE SAME PART IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP CONSIDERING THAT WE BELIEVE IT TO BE OUR MERIT AS WE ARE BOTH KINGS
A GREAT STONE THAT I HAPPENED TO FIND AFTER A LONG SEARCH BY THE SEA-SHORE SERVED ME FOR AN ANCHOR
AND IN THAT THOU SAWEST THAT THE MAN STOOD BEHIND THE WALL TO MAINTAIN THE FIRE THAT IS TO TEACH THEE THAT IT IS HARD FOR THE TEMPTED TO SEE HOW THIS WORK OF GRACE IS MAINTAINED IN THE SOUL
BUT ALTHOUGH THE SPEAR OF IVANHOE DID BUT TOUCH THE SHIELD OF BOIS-GUILBERT THAT CHAMPION TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO BEHELD IT REELED IN HIS SADDLE LOST HIS STIRRUPS AND FELL IN THE LISTS
HIS SON WHO WAS CALLED ALADDIN WAS A VERY CARELESS AND IDLE FELLOW
NEAR THE BANKS OF A LARGE PIECE OF WATER WHICH HAD ENGAGED MY ATTENTION I THOUGHT I HEARD A RUSTLING NOISE BEHIND
WE DID NOT HESITATE TO TAKE TO OUR RAFTS AND PUT TO SEA WITH ALL THE SPEED WE COULD
AND BY THIS TIME THE STORM WAS MUCH ABATED
WHILE SOME DIVERTED THEMSELVES WITH GATHERING FLOWERS AND OTHERS FRUITS I TOOK MY WINE AND PROVISIONS AND SAT DOWN NEAR A STREAM BETWEEN TWO HIGH TREES WHICH FORMED A THICK SHADE
THE MERCHANTS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN THEIR SHOUTING TO FRIGHTEN THE EAGLES
BUT ABOVE ALL THE WARM AND JOYFUL THOUGHTS THAT THEY HAD ABOUT THEIR OWN DWELLING THERE WITH SUCH COMPANY AND THAT FOR EVER AND EVER
AND TURNING THEIR HORSES AT THE SAME MOMENT THE TWO SPURRED AGAINST THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT
OTHERS OF BOTH SIDES WERE BEATEN DOWN AND SLAUGHTERED ABOVE ME SO THAT I NEVER RECOVERED MY SENSES UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF IN A COFFIN--AN OPEN ONE BY GOOD LUCK--PLACED BEFORE THE ALTAR IN CHURCH HAVING CONCLUDED HIS STORY STILL BREATHLESS WITH EXCITEMENT HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
AND WITH THAT I SAW MANY CATCH'D UP AND CARRIED AWAY INTO THE CLOUDS BUT I WAS LEFT BEHIND
BUT THE BRIGHTNESS AND LUSTRE THEY EMITTED IN THE DAYTIME AND THE VARIETY OF THE COLORS SO DAZZLED THE EYES BOTH OF MOTHER AND SON THAT THEY WERE ASTONISHED BEYOND MEASURE
HIS FATHER WHEN ALIVE STROVE ALL HE COULD TO TEACH HIM HIS TRADE BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED
WHERE TO MY GREAT COMFORT I CLAMBERED UP THE CLIFTS AND SAT UPON THE GRASS FREE FROM DANGER AND QUITE OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WATER I WAS NOW LANDED AND SAFE ON SHORE AND BEGAN TO LOOK UP AND THANK GOD THAT MY LIFE WAS SAVED IN A CASE WHEREIN THERE WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE SCARCE ANY ROOM TO HOPE
HE HAD OBSERVED WITH DISPLEASURE THAT ROWENA WAS SELECTED BY THE VICTOR ON THE PRECEDING DAY AS THE OBJECT OF THAT HONOUR WHICH IT BECAME HIS PRIVILEGE TO CONFER AND ATHELSTANE CONFIDENT OF HIS OWN STRENGTH AND SKILL HAD HIMSELF DONNED HIS ARMOUR WITH A DETERMINATION TO MAKE HIS RIVAL FEEL THE WEIGHT OF HIS BATTLE-AXE
HIS MAGIC ART SOON REVEALED TO HIM THAT ALADDIN WAS THE PERSON WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER
THEN I PERCEIVE TIS NOT BEST TO COVET THINGS THAT ARE NOW BUT TO WAIT FOR THINGS TO COME
AND SAYEST THOU SO MY DEAR
THE RUMOURED INTELLIGENCE HAD SCARCELY REACHED HIM WHEN DE BRACY WAS USHERED INTO HIS PRESENCE HIS ARMOUR STILL BEARING THE MARKS OF THE LATE FRAY AND COVERED WITH CLAY AND DUST FROM CREST TO SPUR
NO NOR COULD I REMEMBER THE NEXT MORNING FOR NEVER FRIGHTENED HARE FLED TO COVER OR FOX TO EARTH WITH MORE TERROR OF MIND THAN I TO THIS RETREAT
WE CONTINUED AT SEA FOR SOME TIME TOUCHED AT SEVERAL ISLANDS AND AT LAST LANDED AT THAT OF SALABAT WHERE SANDAL-WOOD IS OBTAINED WHICH IS MUCH USED IN MEDICINE
SHE REPLIED WITH A SIGH HER GOOD MASTER CASSIM HIMSELF AND THAT HE COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK
THE GROUND AS IF FASHIONED ON PURPOSE FOR THE MARTIAL DISPLAY WHICH WAS INTENDED SLOPED GRADUALLY DOWN ON ALL SIDES TO A LEVEL BOTTOM WHICH WAS ENCLOSED FOR THE LISTS WITH STRONG PALISADES
NOW I WOULD HAVE THEE MAKE IT LIKE THE REST THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED
LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL SHE ALREADY TASTES THEM SAID ULRICA STEPPING BEFORE THE COUCH OF FRONT-DE-BOEUF
AND AS THEY WALKED EVER AND ANON THESE TRUMPETERS EVEN WITH JOYFUL SOUND WOULD BY MIXING THEIR MUSICK WITH LOOKS AND GESTURES STILL SIGNIFY TO CHRISTIAN AND HIS BROTHER HOW WELCOME THEY WERE INTO THEIR COMPANY AND WITH WHAT GLADNESS THEY CAME TO MEET THEM
MERRILY MERRILY SHALL I LIVE NOW UNDER THE BLOSSOM THAT HANGS ON THE BOUGH AS YOU LIKE IT RETOLD BY E
BUT ALL WAS TO NO PURPOSE
EXAMINE THEM WELL AND MAKE ALL THE DESPATCH YOU CAN THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS EXAMINED THE THREE-AND-TWENTY WINDOWS WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND AFTER THEY HAD CONSULTED TOGETHER TO KNOW WHAT EACH COULD FURNISH THEY RETURNED AND PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE SULTAN WHOSE PRINCIPAL JEWELLER UNDERTAKING TO SPEAK FOR THE REST SAID
BY HEAVEN THOU HAST AND THE CASTLE IS IN FLAMES THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA
AND BESIDES A DILIGENT SEARCH INTO MY POCKETS HIS MAJESTY ENGAGED MY HONOR NOT TO CARRY AWAY ANY OF HIS SUBJECTS ALTHOUGH WITH THEIR OWN CONSENT AND DESIRE
YOU MUST OBSERVE AN INVIOLABLE SECRECY
WHEN THEY WERE SAT DOWN THE FARMER PLACED ME AT SOME DISTANCE FROM HIM ON THE TABLE WHICH WAS THIRTY FEET HIGH FROM THE FLOOR
HAVING LANDED ON THE ENGLISH COAST HE WROTE TO THE COLONEL OF HIS REGIMENT FOR SUCH TESTIMONY OF HIS RANK IN THE ARMY AS SHOULD PLACE HIS CHARACTER AS A GENTLEMAN AND AN OFFICER BEYOND QUESTION
AT LENGTH THERE BEING NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF WAR WITH TURKEY I RETURNED TO FRANCE ON LEAVE FOR A FEW MONTHS AND WAS STAYING IN THE SAME CHATEAU AS I HAD BEEN WHEN I HAD FIRED OFF THIS REMARKABLE CHARGE
THE WIND BEING FAVORABLE THE SEAMEN TOWED AND I SHOVED TILL WE ARRIVED WITHIN FORTY YARDS OF THE SHORE AND WAITING TILL THE TIDE WAS OUT I GOT DRY TO THE BOAT AND BY THE ASSISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND MEN WITH ROPES AND ENGINES I MADE A SHIFT TO TURN IT ON ITS BOTTOM AND FOUND IT WAS BUT LITTLE DAMAGED
AND AS TO THE SERPENTS THEY ADDED THAT THERE WERE ABUNDANCE IN THE ISLAND
HE MADE HIS PASSENGER CAPTAIN OF ONE WITH FOUR OF THE MEN
LEAD MINES ARE FOUND IN THE ISLAND
AFTER SOME TIME I CAME THITHER DRESSED IN MY NEW HABIT
NOTHING OF WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH
AND THE FOLLOWING DAY HE SET OUT FOR CONINGSBURGH TO ATTEND THE OBSEQUIES OF THE DECEASED ATHELSTANE WAMBA ALONE BEING HIS COMPANION
TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED THAT THEY WERE GROOMS BELONGING TO THE SOVEREIGN OF THE ISLAND AND THAT EVERY YEAR THEY BROUGHT THITHER THE KING'S HORSES FOR PASTURAGE
I ANSWERED IN FEW WORDS BUT TO NO PURPOSE AND MADE A SIGN WITH MY HAND THAT WAS LOOSE PUTTING IT TO THE OTHER BUT OVER HIS EXCELLENCY'S HEAD FOR FEAR OF HURTING HIM OR HIS TRAIN AND THEN TO MY OWN HEAD AND BODY TO SIGNIFY THAT I DESIRED MY LIBERTY
THOSE NEGROES REPLIED THEY EAT MEN
THEN SHE SET ME ON A TABLE WHERE I SHOWED HER MY HANGER ALL BLOODY AND WIPING IT ON THE LAPPET OF MY COAT RETURNED IT TO THE SCABBARD
FOR THAT SHORE LYING PRETTY STEEP--THAT IS TO SAY SLOPING--THERE WAS NO PLACE TO LAND BUT WHERE ONE END OF MY FLOAT IF IT RAN ON SHORE WOULD LIE SO HIGH AND THE OTHER SINK LOWER AS BEFORE THAT IT WOULD ENDANGER MY CARGO AGAIN
STIR NOT WHATEVER YOU SEE OR HEAR AND NOTHING SHALL BEFALL YOU SHE MADE HIM LIE DOWN AMONG A PARCEL OF STRAW AND COVERED HIM CAREFULLY
HIS SKIN WAS CLEAR AS THAT OF A CHILD HIS BODY LIGHTSOME AND FREE
JULIA BEHELD HER LOVER
FOR SHE LOVED HIM DEARLY EVEN AS HE LOVED HER
HOUSES
AFTER A LITTLE TIME LUCY BERTRAM AND MISS MANNERING BECAME FAST FRIENDS BUT THE LATTER WAS CAREFUL NEVER TO SAY ANYTHING TO HER NEW COMPANION ABOUT HER LOVER CAPTAIN BROWN
NIGHT COMING UPON ME I BEGAN WITH A HEAVY HEART TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD BE MY LOT IF THERE WERE ANY RAVENOUS BEASTS IN THAT COUNTRY SEEING AT NIGHT THEY ALWAYS COME ABROAD FOR THEIR PREY
BROWN IN A FIT OF JEALOUSY AND FEARING THAT THE GUN MIGHT GO OFF RUSHED UPON HAZLEWOOD AND SEIZED THE FOWLING-PIECE
THE PLACE HAD FOR MANY YEARS HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING HAUNTED
YET NOTWITHSTANDING MY FRUGALITY ALL MY PROVISIONS WERE SPENT
BUT I MUST TELL YOU ONCE MORE THAT I AM RESOLVED TO DEMAND THE PRINCESS OF THE SULTAN IN MARRIAGE NOR DO I DESPAIR OF SUCCESS
AFTER SOME TIME SPENT IN PEEPING GRINNING AND CHATTERING HE AT LAST ESPIED ME
I AM EVERY DAY EXPOSED TO FATIGUES AND CALAMITIES AND CAN SCARCELY GET COARSE BARLEY-BREAD FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY WHILE HAPPY SINDBAD EXPENDS IMMENSE RICHES AND LEADS A LIFE OF CONTINUAL PLEASURE
SHE THEN WENT HOME
ON READING THIS INTELLIGENCE THE COLONEL HASTENED AT ONCE TO MR MERVYN'S RESIDENCE HAVING FIRST SENT OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS IN REFERENCE TO THE PURCHASE OF THE ELLANGOWAN ESTATE WHICH AS ALREADY SAID ARRIVED TOO LATE
I COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION BUT AM GOING TO MOUNT ZION THAT I MAY BE DELIVERED FROM THE WRATH TO COME
BEFORE HIM UPON THE SAME ELEPHANT AN OFFICER CARRIES A GOLDEN LANCE IN HIS HAND
SO CHRISTIAN WENT ON HIS WAY
EVERY MORNING HE PINCHED ME TO MAKE ME AWAKE AND AFTERWARD OBLIGED ME TO GET UP AND WALK AND SPURRED ME WITH HIS FEET
NESBIT THE MERCHANT OF VENICE E
GREAT WAS ALONSO'S JOY TO GREET HIS LOVED SON AGAIN AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE FAIR MAID WITH WHOM FERDINAND WAS PLAYING WAS PROSPERO'S DAUGHTER AND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS HAD PLIGHTED THEIR TROTH HE SAID GIVE ME YOUR HANDS LET GRIEF AND SORROW STILL EMBRACE HIS HEART THAT DOTH NOT WISH YOU JOY SO ALL ENDED HAPPILY
THE CAPTAIN NOW HAD NO DIFFICULTY BEFORE HIM BUT TO FURNISH HIS TWO BOATS STOP THE BREACH OF ONE AND MAN THEM
ALL HAPPENED AS PROSPERO DESIRED
THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS PLAIN RELATION I HAD GIVEN HIM AND SAID HE HOPED WHEN WE RETURNED TO ENGLAND I WOULD OBLIGE THE WORLD BY PUTTING IT ON PAPER AND MAKING IT PUBLIC
A SLOOP OF WAR IN THE KING'S SERVICE WAS PURSUING IT IN ORDER TO SEIZE THE SMUGGLED GOODS WHICH WERE ON BOARD WHEN FRANK KENNEDY LOOKING OUT SAW THAT HATTERAICK WAS LIKELY TO ESCAPE AS HE HAD GOT HIS VESSEL ROUND A HEADLAND CALLED WARROCH POINT WHERE IT WAS CONCEALED FROM THE SLOOP UNLESS SOMEONE WENT DOWN TO THE POINT AND MADE A SIGNAL TO THE PURSUERS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE COGITATIONS APPREHENSIONS AND REFLECTIONS IT CAME INTO MY THOUGHTS ONE DAY THAT ALL THIS MIGHT BE A MERE CHIMERA OF MY OWN AND THAT THIS FOOT MIGHT BE THE PRINT OF MY OWN FOOT WHEN I CAME ON SHORE FROM MY BOAT
HE ALSO BROUGHT ME A BOX OF SUGAR A BOX OF FLOUR A BAG FULL OF LEMONS AND TWO BOTTLES OF LIME-JUICE AND ABUNDANCE OF OTHER THINGS
THEY INSISTED ON HER COMING TO LIVE WITH THEM AND MR MAC-MORLAN EVEN OFFERED THE DOMINIE A CLERKSHIP IN HIS ESTABLISHMENT WHERE HE MIGHT STILL BE NEAR HIS LADY PUPIL TO WHOM IN SPITE OF HIS STRANGE AND AWKWARD WAYS HE WAS DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE
WHICH WHEN I HAD SEEN I WISHED MYSELF AMONG THEM
HERE SHE SAID I TAKE MY STAND
I WILL DIG A HOLE AND BURY IT
THEY CLIMBED UP THE SIDES OF THE SHIP WITH SUCH AGILITY AS SURPRISED US
AND RUBBED ON SOME OF THE SAME OINTMENT THAT WAS GIVEN ME AT MY FIRST ARRIVAL AS I HAVE FORMERLY MENTIONED
SO THAT HE LAY TILL DAY LIKE A CAT WATCHING IN VAIN FOR A MOUSE THAT HAS FORTUNATELY REACHED A PLACE OF SAFETY
ABUNDANCE OF SUCH THINGS AS THESE ASSISTED TO ARGUE ME OUT OF ALL APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE DEVIL
AND WE FOUND AS THEY APPROACHED THAT THERE WERE NO LESS THAN TEN MEN IN HER AND THAT THEY HAD FIREARMS WITH THEM
WHEREUPON HE SUDDENLY LEAPED UP TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH HE HAD COME IN AND THENCE UPON THE LEADS AND GUTTERS WALKING UPON THREE LEGS AND HOLDING ME IN THE FOURTH TILL HE CLAMBERED UP TO A ROOF THAT WAS NEXT TO OURS
YET AFTER THIS THEY FOUND THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH LEFT FOR SUPPER AND TWO MEALS FOR THE NEXT DAY
FOR AS I HAPPENED TO LIE ON MY BACK I FOUND MY ARMS AND LEGS WERE STRONGLY FASTENED ON EACH SIDE TO THE GROUND
IT WAS A FINE CLEAR FROSTY WINTER'S DAY WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE WILDS OF CUMBERLAND ON HIS WAY TO HIS DESTINATION IN SCOTLAND
THE WIFE MINCED A BIT OF MEAT THEN CRUMBLED SOME BREAD ON A TRENCHER AND PLACED IT BEFORE ME
THERE WAS A DEAD PAUSE OF MANY MINUTES
SO HE SAID THESE TWO LADS ARE FIGURES
SHORTLY AFTER THE SERPENT CAME HISSING TO THE FOOT OF THE TREE
I AM AFRAID SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED TO HIM ALI BABA TOLD HER THAT SHE NEED NOT FRIGHTEN HERSELF FOR THAT CERTAINLY CASSIM WOULD NOT THINK IT PROPER TO COME INTO THE TOWN TILL THE NIGHT SHOULD BE PRETTY FAR ADVANCED
THAT UPON COMING NEARER AND FINDING HIS ERROR HE SENT OUT HIS LONG-BOAT TO DISCOVER WHAT IT WAS
BUT THEY HAD HAD A TERRIBLE FRIGHT AND WERE QUITE UNABLE TO PURSUE OUR INTENDED SPORT
FIRST SHE SAID TAKE ME TO CHURCH AND MAKE ME YOUR WIFE AND THEN GO TO VENICE AT ONCE TO HELP YOUR FRIEND
IT WAS HERE SAID BABA MUSTAPHA I WAS BLINDFOLDED
BUT WE LAY IN THE UTMOST DISTRESS FOR WATER
HE WAS SILENT
BY SHOWING YOU THE VALUE OF THIS PLATE WHICH IS OF THE FINEST SILVER WE USE IN OUR SHOPS I WILL LET YOU SEE HOW MUCH THE JEW HAS CHEATED YOU THE GOLDSMITH TOOK A PAIR OF SCALES WEIGHED THE DISH AND ASSURED HIM THAT HIS PLATE WOULD FETCH BY WEIGHT SIXTY PIECES OF GOLD WHICH HE OFFERED TO PAY DOWN IMMEDIATELY
AND TAKING TWO OF HIS COURTIERS ASIDE HE PUT THE BILLET INTO THEIR HANDS
BUT I TOLD THEM I KNEW NOT WHAT MERCY TO SHOW THEM
I ADVANCED FORWARD AND CAST ANCHOR ON THE LEE-SIDE OF THE ISLAND WHICH SEEMED TO BE UNINHABITED
YET THERE WAS BY REASON OF A FIERCE FLAME WHICH ISSUED OUT AND CAME FROM BEFORE HIM A CONVENIENT DISTANCE BETWIXT HIM AND THEM AS BETWIXT THE JUDGE AND THE PRISONERS AT THE BAR
AND HIS NAILS WERE AS LONG AND CROOKED AS THE TALONS OF THE GREATEST BIRDS
THEN DROP THIS OTHER HERB ON LYSANDER'S EYES
IF THEN YOU SPILL A DROP OF HIS BLOOD ALL YOUR PROPERTY WILL BE FORFEITED TO THE STATE
ABOVE ALL THINGS HAVE A CARE THAT YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE WALLS SO MUCH AS WITH YOUR CLOTHES
SINDBAD SAID HE TO ME I STAND IN NEED OF YOUR SERVICES
THE ATTENDANTS WERE HOWEVER ANTICIPATED IN THIS GOOD OFFICE
I SAW MOREOVER IN MY DREAM THAT THE INTERPRETER TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND HAD HIM INTO A LITTLE ROOM WHERE SAT TWO LITTLE CHILDREN EACH ONE IN HIS CHAIR
I HAD OCCASION TO GO DOWN TO WAPPING TO SEE SOME GOODS SHIPPED WHICH I WAS SENDING TO SOME FRIENDS AT HAMBURGH
STIRRING HIM WITH HIS PILGRIM'S STAFF HE TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD RISE WITHOUT DELAY AND LEAVE THE MANSION
NO CHAMPION APPEARS FOR THE APPELLANT SAID THE GRAND MASTER
THE ENGLISH CHIVALRY WERE SECOND TO NONE SAID THE PILGRIM WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS CONVERSATION WITH MARKED IMPATIENCE
SO HE ASKED THE CAPTAIN AND THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF THEN CALLS OUT YOU SMITH YOU KNOW MY VOICE
AND DURING THAT TIME HAVE TRAVELLED INTO THE INDIES PERSIA ARABIA SYRIA AND EGYPT AND AFTERWARD CROSSED OVER INTO AFRICA WHERE I TOOK UP MY ABODE
ALADDIN WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND RETURNING SOON AFTER FOUND THE WINDOW AS HE WISHED IT TO BE LIKE THE OTHERS
FOR FIRST I HAD MY LITTLE BOWER AS I CALLED IT WHICH I KEPT IN REPAIR--THAT IS TO SAY I KEPT THE HEDGE WHICH ENCIRCLED IT IN CONSTANTLY FITTED UP TO ITS USUAL HEIGHT THE LADDER STANDING ALWAYS IN THE INSIDE
AND AS I FREQUENTLY STOOD STILL TO LOOK AT MYSELF I COULD NOT BUT SMILE AT THE NOTION OF MY TRAVELLING THROUGH YORKSHIRE WITH SUCH AN EQUIPAGE AND IN SUCH A DRESS
THEY COULD NOT DENY THE FACT OF HIS BEING THERE
HOWEVER IN MY THOUGHTS I COULD NOT SUFFICIENTLY WONDER AT THE INTREPIDITY OF THESE DIMINUTIVE MORTALS WHO DURST VENTURE TO MOUNT AND WALK UPON MY BODY WHILE ONE OF MY HANDS WAS AT LIBERTY WITHOUT TREMBLING AT THE VERY SIGHT OF SO PRODIGIOUS A CREATURE AS I MUST APPEAR TO THEM
ITS SKIN IS SO HARD THAT THEY USUALLY MAKE BUCKLERS OF IT
IT HAD BEEN FOR MANY YEARS THE DWELLING-PLACE OF A FAMILY NAMED BERTRAM EACH OF WHOM HAD IN SUCCESSION BORNE THE TITLE OF THE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN
FOR THE STALKS WERE SO INTERWOVEN THAT I COULD NOT CREEP THROUGH AND THE BEARDS OF THE FALLEN EARS SO STRONG AND POINTED THAT THEY PIERCED THROUGH MY CLOTHES INTO MY FLESH
ACCORDINGLY THEY IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHED THEIR BOAT AGAIN AND GOT ALL OF THEM ON BOARD
THE EMPEROR AND ALL HIS COURT CAME OUT TO MEET US BUT HIS GREAT OFFICERS WOULD BY NO MEANS SUFFER HIS MAJESTY TO ENDANGER HIS PERSON BY MOUNTING ON MY BODY
HER MOUTH SMALL
A SECOND AND THIRD PARTY OF KNIGHTS TOOK THE FIELD AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD VARIOUS SUCCESS YET UPON THE WHOLE THE ADVANTAGE DECIDEDLY REMAINED WITH THE CHALLENGERS NOT ONE OF WHOM LOST HIS SEAT
THEY FELL DOWN ON THEIR KNEES TO THE CAPTAIN AND PROMISED WITH THE DEEPEST IMPRECATIONS THAT THEY WOULD BE FAITHFUL TO HIM TO THE LAST DROP AND THAT THEY SHOULD OWE THEIR LIVES TO HIM AND WOULD GO WITH HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD
YOU HAVE A LARGE PORCELAIN DISH FIT TO HOLD THEM
THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR A HORSE AND HAVING HELPED ME TO MOUNT SOME OF THEM WALKED BEFORE TO SHOW THE WAY WHILE THE REST TOOK MY RAFT AND CARGO AND FOLLOWED
AND I DESIRE YOU TO ADD THIS PLEASURE TO THOSE FOR WHICH I AM ALREADY INDEBTED TO YOU THOUGH IT WAS THE SOLE AIM OF COGIA HOUSSAIN TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF INTO ALI BABA'S HOUSE THAT HE MIGHT KILL HIM WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS OWN LIFE OR MAKING ANY NOISE YET HE EXCUSED HIMSELF AND OFFERED TO TAKE HIS LEAVE
ON EXAMINING THE CAVE HE WAS IN GREAT ADMIRATION TO FIND MUCH MORE RICHES THAN HE HAD EXPECTED FROM ALI BABA'S RELATION
AND THAT IF AT ANY TIME THEY SHOULD BE DRIVEN HERE IT WAS PROBABLE THEY WENT AWAY AGAIN AS SOON AS EVER THEY COULD SEEING THEY HAD NEVER THOUGHT FIT TO FIX HERE UPON ANY OCCASION
WHAT HARDSHIP TERROR AND AMAZEMENT HAST THOU ALREADY GONE THROUGH AND ART THOU NOW NOTHING BUT FEAR
AND WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING MORE TO DETAIN THEM LEFT THE PLACE OF THEIR HOARDS WELL CLOSED
BUT ADVANCING FORWARD TOWARD MY MASTER AS I SHALL HENCEFORTH CALL HIM HIS YOUNGEST SON WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM AN ARCH BOY OF ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD TOOK ME UP BY THE LEGS AND HELD ME SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT I TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB
NOW HE HAD NOT RUN FAR FROM HIS OWN DOOR BUT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN PERCEIVING IT BEGAN TO CRY AFTER HIM TO RETURN
FRIDAY RESCUED FROM THE CANNIBALS BY DANIEL DEFOE I WAS SURPRISED ONE MORNING BY SEEING NO LESS THAN FIVE CANOES ALL ON SHORE TOGETHER ON MY SIDE THE ISLAND AND THE PEOPLE WHO BELONGED TO THEM ALL LANDED AND OUT OF MY SIGHT
I REFLECTED WHAT A MORTIFICATION IT MUST PROVE TO ME TO APPEAR AS INCONSIDERABLE IN THIS NATION AS ONE SINGLE LILLIPUTIAN WOULD BE AMONG US
SOME BEGGED HIS BLESSING SOME KISSED HIS HAND AND OTHERS MORE RESERVED ONLY THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT
BUT I WAS AFTERWARDS GIVEN PRIVATELY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY NEVER IMAGINING I HAD THE LEAST NOTICE OF HIS DESIGNS BELIEVED I WAS ONLY GONE TO BLEFUSCU IN PERFORMANCE OF MY PROMISE ACCORDING TO THE LICENCE HE HAD GIVEN ME WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AT OUR COURT AND WOULD RETURN IN A FEW DAYS WHEN THE CEREMONY WAS ENDED
I ASKED THE CAPTAIN IF HE WERE WILLING TO VENTURE WITH THESE HANDS ON BOARD THE SHIP
WHEREUPON THERE WAS A GREAT SHOUT IN A VERY SHRILL ACCENT AND AFTER IT CEASED I HEARD ONE OF THEM CRY-ALOUD TOLGO PHONAC
WITH THIS INSTRUMENT I SEVERED THE LION'S HEAD AT ONE BLOW AND THE BODY FELL AT MY FEET
HAVE I DREAMED OF SUCH A FIGURE AS HE WAS ASKING HIMSELF THE QUESTION THE GIPSY SUDDENLY MADE TWO STRIDES TOWARDS HIM AND SEIZED HIS HAND AT THE SAME TIME SAYING TO HIM
THIS ACTION OF THE MAGICIAN PLAINLY REVEALED TO ALADDIN THAT HE WAS NO UNCLE OF HIS BUT ONE WHO DESIGNED HIM EVIL
THERE ALSO SAT A MAN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE DOOR AT A TABLE-SIDE WITH A BOOK AND HIS INKHORN BEFORE HIM TO TAKE THE NAME OF HIM THAT SHOULD ENTER THEREIN
SOMETIMES I WOULD PUT UP MY SAIL AND THEN MY BUSINESS WAS ONLY TO STEER WHILE THE LADIES GAVE ME A GALE WITH THEIR FANS
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME HE TOLD HER THE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND HERS AND THAT HE HAD CAUSED THIS STORM TO RISE IN ORDER THAT HIS ENEMIES ANTONIO AND ALONSO WHO WERE ON BOARD MIGHT BE DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WAS ALSO A MEADOW CURIOUSLY BEAUTIFIED WITH LILIES
MY RAFT WAS NOW STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR ANY REASONABLE WEIGHT
I HENCEFORTH GIVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY
I HAVE A GREAT MANY APARTMENTS UNOCCUPIED
THE WHICH WHEN THEY DID SOME FROM ABOVE LOOKED OVER THE GATE TO WIT ENOCH MOSES AND ELIJAH C TO WHOM IT WAS SAID THESE PILGRIMS ARE COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION FOR THE LOVE THAT THEY BEAR TO THE KING OF THIS PLACE
AND THERE THAT I MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON A CAPTAIN BUT HAVE A SHIP AT MY OWN COMMAND I REMAINED TILL ONE WAS BUILT ON PURPOSE AT MY OWN CHARGE
NOTHING INDEED WAS EVER SEEN SO BEAUTIFUL AND BRILLIANT IN THE SULTAN'S PALACE AND THE RICHEST ROBES OF THE EMIRS OF HIS COURT WERE NOT TO BE COMPARED TO THE COSTLY DRESSES OF THESE SLAVES WHOM THEY SUPPOSED TO BE KINGS
BUT BEFORE SHE STARTED SHE TOLD HER FRIEND HELENA WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO
MY GOOD SISTER SAID HE DO NOT BE SURPRISED AT YOUR NEVER HAVING SEEN ME ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO MY BROTHER MUSTAPHA OF HAPPY MEMORY
HOW UNHAPPY AM I NOT TO HAVE COME SOON ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU ONE LAST EMBRACE ALADDIN'S MOTHER DESIRED HIM TO SIT DOWN IN THE SAME PLACE BUT HE DECLINED
WHAT A FOOL QUOTH HE AM I THUS TO LIE IN A STINKING DUNGEON WHEN I MAY AS WELL WALK AT LIBERTY
HE WAS NOT LONG AWAY AND ON RETURNING SAID THAT HE HAD FOUND OUT WHO THE ATTACKING PARTY WERE AND WHITHER THEY WERE BOUND
THIS WICKED MAN ADDED HE UNCOVERING HIS FACE IS THE BROTHER OF THE MAGICIAN WHO ATTEMPTED OUR RUIN
THE ACCOUNT OF THIS ADVENTURE PROVED VERY AGREEABLE TO HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO DID NOT FAIL TO RETURN THANKS FOR WHAT PROVIDENCE HAD SENT THEM BY THE HAND OF SINDBAD
HE CHOSE THE GOLD CASKET FOR HE SAID NEITHER BASE LEAD NOR SILVER COULD CONTAIN HER PICTURE
ONE DAY I FOUND SEVERAL DRY CALABASHES THAT HAD FALLEN FROM A TREE
BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE GENIE DISAPPEARED AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH A TRAY THE SAME NUMBER OF COVERED DISHES AS BEFORE SET THEM DOWN AND VANISHED
BY THIS TIME THE SUN WAS ABOUT TO SET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SKY BECAME AS DARK AS IF IT HAD BEEN COVERED WITH A THICK CLOUD
WHERE ARE THEY SAYS SMITH AGAIN
THEN THEY WENT ON AND CAME TO THE KING'S HIGH-WAY AGAIN AND SO WERE SAFE BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT OF HIS JURISDICTION
BUT BE WHAT YE WILL YE HAVE A FACE AND A TONGUE THAT PUTS ME IN MIND OF OLD TIMES AS BROWN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE ON FOOT THE GIPSY LOOKED AFTER HIM AND MUTTERED TO HERSELF
WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA HE TOOK A LODGING AT A KHAN
AND THE LEAVES THEY ATE TO PREVENT SURFEITS AND OTHER DISEASES THAT ARE INCIDENT TO THOSE THAT HEAT THEIR BLOOD BY TRAVELS
I BELIEVE YOUR NAME IS BROWN SIR SAID GLOSSIN
WALK DIRECTLY ACROSS THE GARDEN TO A TERRACE WHERE YOU WILL SEE A NICHE BEFORE YOU AND IN THAT NICHE A LIGHTED LAMP
A COUSIN BY MY MOTHER'S SIDE TOOK A LIKING TO ME OFTEN SAID I WAS A FINE FORWARD YOUTH AND WAS MUCH INCLINED TO GRATIFY MY CURIOSITY
BUT NEXT MORNING WE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE THROWN UPON AN ISLAND WHERE WE LANDED WITH MUCH JOY
BUT I HAVE LET MYSELF TO ANOTHER EVEN TO THE KING OF PRINCES AND HOW CAN I WITH FAIRNESS GO BACK WITH THEE
SHE WAS SINGING A LOW MONOTONOUS STRAIN
I WILL THEN SEND YOU HOME I STAYED WITH HIM WHILE WAITING FOR THE MONSOON
THE KING THEN COMMANDED TO OPEN THE GATE THAT THE RIGHTEOUS NATION SAITH HE THAT KEEPETH TRUTH MAY ENTER IN
BUT IT WAS UPON SUCH A FOOT AS ILL BECAME THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN-KIND
WE PENETRATED A GREAT WAY INTO THE WOOD AND WHEN HE THOUGHT FIT TO STOP HE BADE ME ALIGHT
WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE SAID THE GENIE
IT WAS BROUGHT PARALLEL TO ME AS I LAY
THE BOON I CRAVE IS THAT THOU WILT FORGIVE AND RECEIVE TO THY PATERNAL AFFECTION THIS GOOD KNIGHT HERE WILFRED OF IVANHOE AND THIS IS WILFRED SAID CEDRIC POINTING TO HIS SON
MY NEXT WORK WAS TO VIEW THE COUNTRY AND SEEK A PROPER PLACE FOR MY HABITATION AND WHERE TO STOW MY GOODS TO SECURE THEM FROM WHATEVER MIGHT HAPPEN
HE LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN AND TALKED MUCH TO ME AND GOT ME AT LAST TO YIELD
THOU HAST ALREADY BEEN UNFAITHFUL IN THY SERVICE TO HIM AND HOW DOST THOU THINK TO RECEIVE WAGES OF HIM
THE ONLY HOPE THAT COULD RATIONALLY GIVE US THE LEAST SHADOW OF EXPECTATION WAS IF WE MIGHT HAPPEN INTO SOME BAY OR GULF OR THE MOUTH OF SOME RIVER WHERE BY GREAT CHANCE WE MIGHT HAVE RUN OUR BOAT IN OR GOT UNDER THE LEE OF THE LAND AND PERHAPS MADE SMOOTH WATER
I WOULD THEREFORE SIR SINCE I AM INFORMED THAT BY THIS GATE IS THE WAY THITHER KNOW IF YOU ARE WILLING TO LET ME IN
I SAW ALSO THAT HE LOOKED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF HE WOULD RUN
THE WEARIED HORSE OF IVANHOE AND ITS NO LESS EXHAUSTED RIDER WENT DOWN AS ALL HAD EXPECTED BEFORE THE WELL-AIMED LANCE AND VIGOROUS STEED OF THE TEMPLAR
AT A GLANCE HE SAW HOW MATTERS STOOD
NO IF YOU PLEASE LET ME GO FIRST THAT IF THERE BE ANY DANGER I MAY BE FIRST THEREIN BECAUSE BY MY MEANS WE ARE BOTH GONE OUT OF THE WAY
AFTER HAVING EXAMINED ME AND PERCEIVING ME TO BE SO LEAN THAT I HAD NOTHING BUT SKIN AND BONE HE LET ME GO
I IMMEDIATELY RECOLLECTED MY FORMER ADVENTURE LOOKED UPON HIM AS MY PROPERTY AND BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND BY ONE SHOT WHICH AT ONCE GAVE ME THE HAUNCH AND CHERRY SAUCE FOR THE TREE WAS COVERED WITH THE RICHEST FRUIT THE LIKE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER TASTED BEFORE
BUT I WAS SO AMAZED AND OUT OF BREATH THAT I COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
HIS WORD GIVES ME NO ENCOURAGEMENT TO BELIEVE
DURING THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THEM HATTERAICK ALSO TOLD THE ATTORNEY THAT YOUNG BERTRAM WAS STILL ALIVE AND AT KIPPLETRINGAN
AND IT IS NOW SO LATE THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO LODGE
CASSIM WHO HEARD THE NOISE OF THE HORSES FEET AT ONCE GUESSED THE ARRIVAL OF THE ROBBERS AND RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE EFFORT FOR HIS LIFE
BUT SHE INFORMED HIM OF THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF REMOVING TO YORK AND OF HER FATHER'S RESOLUTION TO TRANSPORT HIM THITHER AND TEND HIM IN HIS OWN HOUSE UNTIL HIS WOUND SHOULD BE HEALED
BOIS-GUILBERT RETURNED NO ANSWER
AND AGAIN AMIDST A BREATHLESS SILENCE THEY SPRUNG FROM THEIR STATIONS AND CLOSED IN THE CENTRE OF THE OPEN SPACE WITH THE SAME SPEED THE SAME DEXTERITY THE SAME VIOLENCE BUT NOT THE SAME EQUAL FORTUNE AS BEFORE
I DID MY UTMOST BY SETTING MY BACK AGAINST THE CHESTS TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACES BUT COULD NOT THRUST OFF THE RAFT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH
THEY HAD BORED TWO HOLES IN THE BRIM WITHIN AN INCH AND A HALF OF THE EDGE AND FASTENED TWO HOOKS IN THE HOLES
I WAS UNDER SOME APPREHENSION DURING MY ABSENCE FROM THE LAND THAT AT LEAST MY PROVISIONS MIGHT BE DEVOURED ON SHORE
IN THE MEANTIME I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF
BUT HE RAN SO FAST AND HAD GOT SO FAR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO OVERTAKE HIM
I WAS INDEED TREATED WITH MUCH KINDNESS
SHE DIED SHORTLY BEFORE PROSPERO WAS CAST ON THOSE SHORES BUT THE SPIRITS OF WHOM ARIEL WAS THE CHIEF STILL REMAINED IN THEIR PRISONS
HERE HE REMAINED FOR THE NIGHT
THY WISH EVEN NOW IS FOR A HORSE AND ARMOUR THE PALMER STARTED
YOU COME HERE AS A SPY HE SAID TO FERDINAND
IN THEIR CRUELTY AND HATRED THEY PUT HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER MIRANDA NOT YET THREE YEARS OLD INTO THE BOAT WITH HIM AND SAILED AWAY LEAVING THEM TO THEIR FATE
BUT WHEN SHE CAME THERE SHE FOUND THE GATES OF THE DIVAN SHUT
AND IT WAS EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH FOR US TO KEEP THEM ASUNDER AND SUPPLY THEM WITH VICTUALS
WHEN ALADDIN'S MOTHER HAD TAKEN AWAY AND SET BY WHAT WAS LEFT SHE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY HER SON ON THE SOFA SAYING I EXPECT NOW THAT YOU SHOULD SATISFY MY IMPATIENCE AND TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THE GENIE AND YOU WHILE I WAS IN A SWOON
I SAW THEM AS YOU STOOPED OVER MY BED THIS MORNING WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR HIS COMPANION'S REPLY HE WROTE SOME WORDS IN HEBREW ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND HANDED IT TO THE PILGRIM SAYING
AND ALSO BECAUSE HE WILL HAVE THE GLORY OF HIS WHEN THE OTHER HAS NOTHING BUT RAGS
THIS UNEXPECTED ATTACK IN HIS REAR FRIGHTENED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE LEAPT FORWARD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE HORSE'S CARCASS DROPPED ON THE GROUND BUT IN HIS PLACE THE WOLF WAS IN THE HARNESS AND I ON MY PART WHIPPING HIM CONTINUALLY WE BOTH ARRIVED IN FULL CAREER SAFE AT ST PETERSBURG CONTRARY TO OUR RESPECTIVE EXPECTATIONS AND VERY MUCH TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE SPECTATORS
I WAS A LONG TIME ON THE JOURNEY AND SUFFERED MUCH BUT WAS HAPPY IN THINKING THAT I HAD NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE SEAS FROM PIRATES FROM SERPENTS OR FROM THE OTHER PERILS TO WHICH I HAD BEEN EXPOSED
BUT THAT THEY ALL HAD FLED AWAY FROM HIM HAVING HEARD THAT THERE WAS A STRONG BAND OF OUTLAWS LYING IN WAIT IN THE WOODS BEFORE THEM
AS SOON AS ALADDIN FOUND THAT THEIR PROVISIONS WERE AGAIN EXPENDED HE TOOK ONE OF THE DISHES AND WENT TO LOOK FOR HIS JEW CHAPMAN
THE FIERCENESS OF THIS CREATURE'S COUNTENANCE ALTOGETHER DISCOMPOSED ME
WHICH AS IT HAPPENED WAS VERY WELL FOR HIM IN THE END
YOU MUST OVERCOME YOUR AVERSION TO THE MAGICIAN AND ASSUME A MOST FRIENDLY MANNER TOWARD HIM AND ASK HIM TO OBLIGE YOU BY PARTAKING OF AN ENTERTAINMENT IN YOUR APARTMENTS
FOR AS TO MY FIGURE I HAD SO FEW TO OBSERVE ME THAT IT WAS OF NO MANNER OF CONSEQUENCE SO I SAY NO MORE OF THAT
FROM WHENCE KEEPING FURTHER OFF AT SEA WE LOST SIGHT OF LAND AND STEERED AS IF WE WERE BOUND FOR THE ISLE FERNANDO DE NORONHA HOLDING OUR COURSE N
WHICH PROCEEDED WHOLLY FROM THE MALICE OF SKYRESH BOLGOLAM THE HIGH ADMIRAL
AND I HAD A LONG LEASE OF THE BLACK BULL IN FETTER LANE WHICH YIELDED ME AS MUCH MORE
I SLEPT WELL AND I CONJECTURE AT LEAST SIX HOURS FOR I FOUND THE DAY BROKE IN TWO HOURS AFTER I AWAKED
ONE TRIBE OF THESE GIPSIES AMONGST WHOM MEG MERRILIES WAS A KIND OF QUEEN HAD LIVED FOR A LONG TIME UNMOLESTED IN A FEW HUTS IN A GLEN UPON THE ESTATE OF ELLANGOWAN AT A PLACE CALLED DERNCLEUGH
MY DAUGHTER KNEELED TO ASK MY BLESSING BUT I COULD NOT SEE HER TILL SHE AROSE HAVING BEEN SO LONG USED TO STAND WITH MY HEAD AND EYES ERECT TO ABOVE SIXTY FEET
WHERE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIM AND MY UNCLE JOHN AND SOME OTHER RELATIONS I GOT FORTY POUNDS AND A PROMISE OF THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR TO MAINTAIN ME AT LEYDEN
BUT SUCH WAS THE FLOOD OF JOY IN MY BREAST THAT IT PUT ALL MY SPIRITS INTO CONFUSION
WHAT SAID THE PERSON WHOM HE ADDRESSED HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF HER
WERE IT NOT THAT I HOPE THOU MAYEST DO ME MORE SERVICE I WOULD STRIKE THEE NOW AT ONE BLOW TO THE GROUND
THEN I THOUGHT I WOULD GO AND LOOK AT OUR SHIP'S BOAT WHICH AS I HAVE SAID WAS BLOWN UP UPON THE SHORE A GREAT WAY IN THE STORM WHEN WE WERE FIRST CAST AWAY
BUT THE QUEEN WOULD NOT GIVE HIM UP
HE NO SOONER HAD IT BUT HE RUNS TO HIS ENEMY AND AT ONE BLOW CUT OFF HIS HEAD SO CLEVERLY NO EXECUTIONER IN GERMANY COULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER OR BETTER
AND HAVING NO BOAT NOW TO TAKE CARE OF I WENT OVER THE LAND A NEARER WAY TO THE SAME HEIGHT THAT I WAS UPON BEFORE WHEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THE POINTS OF THE ROCKS WHICH LAY OUT AND WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO DOUBLE WITH MY BOAT AS IS SAID ABOVE I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE SEA ALL SMOOTH AND QUIET--NO RIPPLING NO MOTION NO CURRENT ANY MORE THERE THAN IN OTHER PLACES
DOWN CAME THE PILES AND PALISADES BEFORE THEIR IRRESISTIBLE ONSLAUGHT
I MET WITH A GENTLEMAN SO SOON AS I HAD GOT OVER THE SLOUGH OF DISPOND WHO PERSUADED ME THAT I MIGHT IN THE VILLAGE BEFORE ME FIND A MAN THAT COULD TAKE OFF MY BURDEN
AND AT ALADDIN'S COMMAND TRANSPORTED THE COUCH WITH THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM ON IT BY THE SAME INVISIBLE AGENCY INTO THE PALACE OF THE SULTAN
THEN CHRISTIAN TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND AND HE AGAIN BID HIM GOD SPEED
AND WHETHER THE FRESH AIR ON THE ROOF HAD SHARPENED MY STOMACH
SO BE IT THEN PROUD DAMSEL SAID BOIS-GUILBERT
HE PRESENTED THE SIX WOMEN SLAVES TO HIS MOTHER TELLING HER THEY WERE HER SLAVES AND THAT THE DRESSES THEY HAD BROUGHT WERE FOR HER USE
AND IF THEY HAD COME DOWN THEY WERE STILL ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY OUTER WALL
I ASKED HIM WHY HE SAT SO STILL
AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
AND NOW IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND THUNDER AND LIGHTEN IN A VERY DREADFUL MANNER AND THE WATER ROSE AMAIN
AND WHEN THE MATTER WAS DEBATED IN COUNCIL THE WISEST PART OF THE MINISTRY WERE OF MY OPINION
IN A WORD IT TOOK US WITH SUCH A FURY THAT IT OVERSET THE BOAT AT ONCE
AND IT WAS AFTER LONG SEARCHING THAT I FOUND OUT THE CARPENTER'S CHEST WHICH WAS INDEED A VERY USEFUL PRIZE TO ME AND MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN A SHIP-LOAD OF GOLD WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT TIME
I TOLD THEM THE STORY ALSO OF THE SEVENTEEN SPANIARDS THAT WERE TO BE EXPECTED FOR WHOM I LEFT A LETTER AND MADE THEM PROMISE TO TREAT THEM IN COMMON WITH THEMSELVES
I TRAVELLED FIRST ALONG THE SEASHORE DIRECTLY TO THE PLACE WHERE I FIRST BROUGHT MY BOAT TO AN ANCHOR TO GET UPON THE ROCKS
SO NOW DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER WERE BOTH FOLLOWING HER THROUGH THE WOOD AND IT WAS HERMIA'S TURN TO FOLLOW HER LOVER AS HELENA HAD DONE BEFORE
ONE OF THESE WHICH WAS THE DRIEST AND LARGEST AND HAD A DOOR OUT BEYOND MY WALL OR FORTIFICATION--THAT IS TO SAY BEYOND WHERE MY WALL JOINED TO THE ROCK--WAS ALL FILLED UP WITH THE LARGE EARTHEN POTS OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN AN ACCOUNT AND WITH FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN GREAT BASKETS WHICH WOULD HOLD FIVE OR SIX BUSHELS EACH WHERE I LAID UP MY STORES OF PROVISIONS ESPECIALLY MY CORN SOME IN THE EAR CUT OFF SHORT FROM THE STRAW AND THE OTHER RUBBED OUT WITH MY HAND
THOSE THAT CAME ON SHORE KEPT CLOSE TOGETHER MARCHING TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE LITTLE HILL UNDER WHICH MY HABITATION LAY
BUT WAS SO MUCH STRAITENED FOR WANT OF ROOM IN HIS HOUSE THAT HE COULD NOT ENTERTAIN HIM
AND IN SOME OF ITS VALLEYS ARE FOUND DIAMONDS
ON BEING LEFT IN THE SECLUDED CELL SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF AN OLD HAG WHO KEPT MURMURING TO HERSELF A SAXON RHYME AS IF TO BEAT TIME TO THE SPINDLE AT WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED
MADAM ANSWERED THE SLAVE LAUGHING STILL WHO CAN FORBEAR LAUGHING TO SEE AN OLD MAN WITH A BASKET ON HIS ARM FULL OF FINE NEW LAMPS ASKING TO CHANGE THEM FOR OLD ONES
HE PREPARED THE SAND CAST THE POINTS AND DREW THE FIGURES
THERE WAS A GENERAL CONSTERNATION
HER SMILE BEWITCHING
BUT THEY ARE WELCOME TO THE HOSPITALITY OF ROTHERWOOD
AND NOW OUR WHOLE CITY IS ENRICHED BY YOUR MEANS WITHOUT ANY MORE EXPOSING THE LIVES OF OUR SLAVES
ON THE SIXTH DAY HOWEVER AFTER THE DIVAN WAS BROKEN UP WHEN THE SULTAN RETURNED TO HIS OWN APARTMENT HE SAID TO HIS GRAND VIZIER I HAVE FOR SOME TIME OBSERVED A CERTAIN WOMAN WHO ATTENDS CONSTANTLY EVERY DAY THAT I GIVE AUDIENCE WITH SOMETHING WRAPPED UP IN A NAPKIN
ONE OF THESE SLAVES SHALL MAINTAIN THE FIRE BENEATH THEE WHILE ANOTHER SHALL ANOINT THY WRETCHED LIMBS WITH OIL LEST THE ROAST SHOULD BURN
AS I PAID MY COURT VERY CONSTANTLY TO THE KING HE SAID TO ME ONE DAY SINDBAD I LOVE THEE I HAVE ONE THING TO DEMAND OF THEE WHICH THOU MUST GRANT
NESBIT HERMIA AND LYSANDER WERE LOVERS
THEY ROSE AND I KILLED TWENTY-FIVE AT ONE SHOT
THEN HER FATHER BADE HER TO HAVE NO FEAR FOR HE INTENDED TO SAVE EVERY ONE OF THEM
AFTER WE HAD ROWED OR RATHER DRIVEN ABOUT A LEAGUE AND A HALF AS WE RECKONED IT A RAGING WAVE MOUNTAIN-LIKE CAME ROLLING ASTERN OF US AND PLAINLY BADE US EXPECT THE COUP DE GRACE
NO SOONER WERE THEY WELL OUTSIDE THAN MEG MERRILIES GOT UP FROM WHERE SHE HAD BEEN PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP AND TOLD BROWN TO FOLLOW HER INSTANTLY
SOME TIME AFTER THIS THE BOAT WAS ORDERED ON SHORE THE TIDE BEING UP WITH THE THINGS PROMISED TO THE MEN
WHETHER THAT OR THE SMELL OF THE MEAT EFFECTED HER CURE IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE CAME TO HERSELF
HE AT ONCE ORDERED A HORSE TO BE SADDLED WHICH HE MOUNTED THAT INSTANT THINKING HE COULD NOT MAKE HASTE ENOUGH TO THE PLACE
CONTENTED WITH THIS DISCOVERY I CAME BACK TO MY RAFT AND FELL TO WORK TO BRING MY CARGO ON SHORE WHICH TOOK ME UP THE REST OF THAT DAY
THE CAPTAIN ORDERED HIS SAILS TO BE FURLED AND PERMITTED SUCH PERSONS AS WERE SO INCLINED TO LAND
HE RESOLVED AT ONCE ON HIS PLANS
I AM MYSELF ASTONISHED AT MY CONDUCT WHEN I REFLECT UPON IT AND MUST CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY MY DESTINY FROM WHICH NONE CAN ESCAPE
AND SO UNMEASURABLE IS THE AMBITION OF PRINCES THAT HE SEEMED TO THINK OF NOTHING LESS THAN REDUCING THE WHOLE EMPIRE OF BLEFUSCU INTO A PROVINCE AND GOVERNING IT BY A VICEROY
UPON WHICH I SHALL DESIRE LIBERTY WITH THE READER'S PATIENCE TO ENLARGE A LITTLE
HE GAVE ME A LARGE SACK AND HAVING RECOMMENDED ME TO SOME PEOPLE OF THE TOWN WHO USED TO GATHER COCOANUTS DESIRED THEM TO TAKE ME WITH THEM
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT THE INTERPRETER TOOK CHRISTIAN BY THE HAND AND LED HIM INTO A PLACE WHERE WAS A FIRE BURNING AGAINST A WALL AND ONE STANDING BY IT ALWAYS CASTING MUCH WATER UPON IT TO QUENCH IT
HERE IS WHAT WILL PUT YOU IN HEART AND AT THE SAME TIME SATISFY MY EXTREME HUNGER HIS MOTHER WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE THE GREAT TRAY TWELVE DISHES SIX LOAVES THE TWO FLAGONS AND CUPS AND TO SMELL THE SAVORY ODOR WHICH EXHALED FROM THE DISHES
SO I LET AS LITTLE GROW AS I THOUGHT ENOUGH FOR MY OCCASION
GENTLEMAN SHE SAID GIVING HIM A CHAIN FROM HER NECK WEAR THIS FOR ME
I WILL ENDEAVOR TO HELP YOU
YOU SEE THAT COGIA HOUSSAIN SOUGHT YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH A TREACHEROUS DESIGN TO TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
WHEN THE COURT MET BASSANIO OFFERED SHYLOCK TWICE THE MONEY BORROWED IF HE WOULD WITHDRAW HIS CLAIM
AND WHAT COMPLETES THE MISFORTUNE IS THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ASCENDING THE MOUNTAIN OR OF ESCAPING BY SEA
THAT IN THE CENTRE AS THE PLACE OF HONOUR HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT WHOSE RENOWN IN ALL GAMES OF CHIVALRY HAD OCCASIONED HIM TO BE ADOPTED AS THE CHIEF AND LEADER OF THE CHALLENGERS
THERE HE CALLED HIS WIFE AND SHOWED ME TO HER
AFTER A DELAY OF SOME DAYS HE RECEIVED A SHORT LETTER FROM MISS MANNERING IN WHICH SHE UPBRAIDED HIM FOR HIS THOUGHTLESS CONDUCT AND BADE HIM GOOD-BYE TELLING HIM ON NO ACCOUNT TO COME BACK TO WOODBOURNE
IN THE INSIDE OF THIS I THICKENED MY WALL TO ABOUT TEN FEET THICK WITH CONTINUALLY BRINGING EARTH OUT OF MY CAVE AND LAYING IT AT THE FOOT OF THE WALL AND WALKING UPON IT
WHEN IT IS OVER THOU WILT RETURN THEM SAFELY
I TOOK A PURSE OF GOLD OUT OF MY POCKET AND HUMBLY PRESENTED IT TO HIM
SHE AFTERWARD DESCENDED WITH SO MUCH RAPIDITY THAT I LOST MY SENSES
BUT AS THE SAFETY OF THE TROOP REQUIRED THE DISCOVERY OF THE SECOND INTRUDER INTO THE CAVE ANOTHER OF THE GANG WHO PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED BETTER PRESENTED HIMSELF AND HIS OFFER BEING ACCEPTED HE WENT AND CORRUPTED BABA MUSTAPHA AS THE OTHER HAD DONE
HE PERCEIVED THE SURPRISE AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED A BOTTLE OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GAVE ME A DRAM OF CORDIAL WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT ON PURPOSE FOR ME
ORDERS WERE AT ONCE GIVEN BY THE GRAND MASTER TO PREPARE THE GREAT HALL OF THE PRECEPTORY FOR THE TRIAL OF REBECCA AS A SORCERESS
EVERY MAN UNBRIDLED HIS HORSE TIED HIM TO SOME SHRUB AND HUNG ABOUT HIS NECK A BAG OF CORN WHICH THEY BROUGHT BEHIND THEM
I SOON FELL ASLEEP AND ALL I CAN CONJECTURE IS THAT WHILE I SLEPT THE PAGE THINKING NO DANGER COULD HAPPEN WENT AMONG THE ROCKS TO LOOK FOR BIRDS EGGS HAVING BEFORE OBSERVED HIM FROM MY WINDOW SEARCHING ABOUT AND PICKING UP ONE OR TWO IN THE CLEFTS
MY OWN WIFE FELL SICK AND DIED
NAY STAY SAID THE INTERPRETER TILL I HAVE SHEWED THEE A LITTLE MORE AND AFTER THAT THOU SHALT GO ON THY WAY
HAVING ARISEN HE MADE ME CARRY HIM UNDER THE TREES AND FORCED ME NOW AND THEN TO STOP THAT HE MIGHT GATHER AND EAT FRUIT
I BELIEVE BROTHER-IN-LAW THAT YOU KNOW CASSIM IS GONE TO THE FOREST AND UPON WHAT ACCOUNT
HE SAT ASTRIDE UPON MY SHOULDERS AND HELD MY THROAT SO TIGHT THAT I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE STRANGLED ME AND I FAINTED AWAY
I HAD THE BIGGEST MAGAZINE OF ALL KINDS NOW THAT EVER WAS LAID UP I BELIEVE FOR ONE MAN
AFTER THIS EXPLOIT I WALKED GENTLY TO AND FRO ON THE BED TO RECOVER MY BREATH AND LOSS OF SPIRITS
HIS SUIT OF ARMOUR WAS FORMED OF STEEL RICHLY INLAID WITH GOLD AND THE DEVICE ON HIS SHIELD WAS A YOUNG OAK-TREE PULLED UP BY THE ROOTS WITH THE WORD DISINHERITED INSCRIBED UPON IT
WHEN THE TEMPLAR CROSSED THE HALL YESTERNIGHT HE CONTINUED I HEARD HIM SPEAK TO HIS MUSSULMAN SLAVES IN THE SARACEN LANGUAGE WHICH I WELL UNDERSTAND AND HE CHARGED THEM TO WATCH THE JOURNEY OF THE JEW TO SEIZE UPON HIM WHEN AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE MANSION AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO THE CASTLE OF PHILIP DE MALVOISIN OR TO THAT OF REGINALD FRONT-DE BOEUF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EXTREMITY OF TERROR WHICH SEIZED UPON THE JEW AT THIS INFORMATION
ALADDIN ROSE THAT MORNING BY DAYBREAK PUT ON ONE OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT HABITS HIS WARDROBE AFFORDED AND WENT UP INTO THE HALL OF TWENTY-FOUR WINDOWS FROM WHENCE HE PERCEIVED THE SULTAN APPROACHING AND RECEIVED HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT STAIRCASE HELPING HIM TO DISMOUNT
I REJOICE THAT FORTUNE HAS RECTIFIED MY FAULT
BUT LOUD MUST BE THY VOICE OF COMPLAINT IF IT IS HEARD BEYOND THE IRON WALLS OF THIS CASTLE
IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT ALADDIN WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SUCH A BLAZE OF CHARMS WAS DAZZLED AND ENCHANTED
DINMONT ROARED LOUDLY FOR MAC-GUFFOG TO LET THEM OUT BUT ALL WAS SILENT IN THE GAOL
AND HERE I MET AN OLD COMRADE OF MINE ONE PETER WILLIAMS WHO GAVE ME A GOOD CHARACTER TO THE CAPTAIN
AND THE SEA BEING FULL IN MY VIEW I SAW OUR MEN ALREADY GOT INTO THE BOAT AND ROWING FOR LIFE TO THE SHIP
WHEREFORE GETTING OUT AGAIN ON THAT SIDE NEXT TO HIS OWN HOUSE HE TOLD ME I SHOULD POSSESS THE BRAVE COUNTRY ALONE FOR HIM
WHEN THE PRETENDED FATIMA CAME ALADDIN SAID COME HITHER GOOD MOTHER
I HEARD IT ALSO PROCLAIMED TO THEM THAT ATTENDED ON THE MAN THAT SAT ON THE CLOUD GATHER TOGETHER THE TARES THE CHAFF AND STUBBLE AND CAST THEM INTO THE BURNING LAKE
AS SOON AS THEY GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEIR OTHER BOAT LAY THEY RAN THEIR BOAT INTO THE BEACH AND CAME ALL ON SHORE HAULING THE BOAT UP AFTER THEM WHICH I WAS GLAD TO SEE FOR I WAS AFRAID THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT THE BOAT AT AN ANCHOR SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE WITH SOME HANDS IN HER TO GUARD HER AND SO WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEIZE THE BOAT
I SUPPLY THE PLACE OF YOUR FATHER AND YOU OUGHT TO MAKE NO REPLY
HOWEVER I MADE ABUNDANCE OF THINGS EVEN WITHOUT TOOLS
AFTER WAITING IN THIS PROSTRATE SITUATION A FEW SECONDS I HEARD A VIOLENT BUT UNUSUAL NOISE DIFFERING FROM ANY SOUND THAT HAD EVER BEFORE ASSAILED MY EARS
BUT HE WAS SOON EASED OF HIS FEARS FOR THE CHANNEL GROWING SHALLOWER EVERY STEP I MADE I CAME IN A SHORT TIME WITHIN HEARING AND HOLDING UP THE END OF THE CABLE BY WHICH THE FLEET WAS FASTENED I CRIED IN A LOUD VOICE LONG LIVE THE MOST PUISSANT EMPEROR OF LILLIPUT THIS GREAT PRINCE RECEIVED ME AT MY LANDING WITH ALL POSSIBLE ENCOMIUMS AND CREATED ME A NARDAC UPON THE SPOT WHICH IS THE HIGHEST TITLE OF HONOR AMONG THEM
AND INDEED THEY WERE NOT ONLY AGREEABLE BUT MEDICINAL WHOLESOME NOURISHING AND REFRESHING TO THE LAST DEGREE
I SAW ANOTHER WHICH HAD THE SHAPE AND COLOR OF A CAMEL
THAT THEY HAD A FIRE KINDLED AND THAT THEY HAD MEAT DRESSED
BUT AS FOR MYSELF I WAS STILL UPON THE ISLAND WHEN IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SEA AND I HAD ONLY TIME TO CATCH HOLD OF A PIECE OF WOOD THAT WE HAD BROUGHT OUT OF THE SHIP TO MAKE A FIRE
BUT THEY WERE TOO FULL OF APPREHENSIONS OF DANGER TO VENTURE TO GO TO SLEEP THOUGH THEY COULD NOT TELL WHAT THE DANGER WAS THEY HAD TO FEAR
HAVING SPENT SOME TIME UPON THE ICE THEY WERE RETURNING TO WOODBOURNE THROUGH THE PLANTATION
DRIVEN ALMOST TO DESPERATION AND WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD PROMISED TO SUPPORT HIM JOHN NOW TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED WALDEMAR FITZURSE ONE OF HIS MOST INTIMATE ATTENDANTS TO DEPART AT ONCE WITH A CHOSEN BAND OF FOLLOWERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERTAKING KING RICHARD AND IF POSSIBLE SECURING HIM AS A PRISONER
WE CAN BELIEVE THAT THE TALES ARE VERY OLD BUT THE MOST WE KNOW IS THAT THEY WERE TRANSLATED FROM ARABIC INTO FRENCH IN 1704-17 BY A FRENCHMAN NAMED GALLAND AND THAT THE MANUSCRIPT OF HIS TRANSLATION IS PRESERVED IN THE FRENCH NATIONAL LIBRARY
AND THE MAGICIAN PERCEIVING ALSO THAT THEY WERE COMING FOR HIM ADVANCED TO MEET THEM OVERJOYED TO FIND HIS PLOT SUCCEED SO WELL
I SAW THE WATER OOZE IN AT SEVERAL CRANNIES ALTHOUGH THE LEAKS WERE NOT CONSIDERABLE AND I ENDEAVORED TO STOP THEM AS WELL AS I COULD
BUT THIS WAS IN VAIN
HE BEQUEATHED ME A LARGE ESTATE WHICH I WASTED IN RIOTOUS LIVING
THEN APOLLYON ESPYING HIS OPPORTUNITY BEGAN TO GATHER UP CLOSE TO CHRISTIAN AND WRESTLING WITH HIM GAVE HIM A DREADFUL FALL
THE STRING AS I CONJECTURE BREAKING BY SOME ACCIDENT WHICH I NEVER OBSERVED BUT THOUGHT MY HAT HAD BEEN LOST AT SEA
AFTER HAVING PROSTRATED HERSELF SHE MADE ANSWER IN REPLY TO THE SULTAN
TO LOSE NO TIME SAID SHE TO HIM I HAVE SENT TO HAVE THE PRIVATE DOOR OPENED FOR YOU
AT LAST UPON HER PRESSING ON HER THE DUTY OF TELLING HER ALL HER THOUGHTS SHE GAVE TO THE SULTANESS A PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF ALL THAT HAPPENED TO HER DURING THE NIGHT
THE CUNNING JEW TOOK THE DISH EXAMINED IT AND AS SOON AS HE FOUND THAT IT WAS GOOD SILVER ASKED ALADDIN AT HOW MUCH HE VALUED IT
HAVING COLLECTED TOGETHER THE LARGEST DIAMONDS I COULD FIND AND PUT THEM INTO THE LEATHER BAG IN WHICH I USED TO CARRY MY PROVISIONS I TOOK THE LARGEST OF THE PIECES OF MEAT TIED IT CLOSE ROUND ME WITH THE CLOTH OF MY TURBAN AND THEN LAID MYSELF UPON THE GROUND WITH MY FACE DOWNWARD THE BAG OF DIAMONDS BEING MADE FAST TO MY GIRDLE
FOR YOU HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH NEED OF A GOOD BREAKFAST AS MYSELF
THE HURGO FOR SO THEY CALL A GREAT LORD AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNT UNDERSTOOD ME VERY WELL
CHILD CRIED SHE YOU ARE UNDONE
SEE THE STREAM O LIGHT THAT FALLS ON THE OLD TOWER OF ELLANGOWAN
THE OTHER SIX HE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE SLAVES WHO BROUGHT THEM WITH AN ORDER TO THROW THEM BY HANDFULS AMONG THE PEOPLE AS THEY WENT TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE
ON LOOKING MORE ATTENTIVELY HE WAS CONVINCED BEYOND THE POWER OF DOUBT THAT IT WAS HIS SON-IN-LAW'S PALACE
I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OFTEN HEARD MARINERS SPEAK OF A MIRACULOUS BIRD CALLED THE ROC AND CONCEIVED THAT THE GREAT DOME WHICH I SO MUCH ADMIRED MUST BE ITS EGG
VIZ THAT THE TIDE OF EBB SETTING FROM THE WEST AND JOINING WITH THE CURRENT OF WATERS FROM SOME GREAT RIVER ON THE SHORE MUST BE THE OCCASION OF THIS CURRENT AND THAT ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLEW MORE FORCIBLY FROM THE WEST OR FROM THE NORTH THIS CURRENT CAME NEARER OR WENT FARTHER FROM THE SHORE
WHICH I THOUGHT VERY STRANGE FOR ONE WHO I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE NEVER SAW A SWORD IN HIS LIFE BEFORE EXCEPT THEIR OWN WOODEN SWORDS
SHAME ON YE FALSE COWARDS EXCLAIMED HE IN THE BLUE HARNESS
RETIRING TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS EACH RECEIVED A FRESH LANCE FROM THE ATTENDANTS
I LIKEWISE TAUGHT HIM TO SAY MASTER AND THEN LET HIM KNOW THAT WAS TO BE MY NAME
AND COMING DOWN I TOOK WHAT PROVISION I HAD LEFT AND WENT TOWARD IT THE DISTANCE BEING SO GREAT THAT I COULD NOT DISTINGUISH WHAT IT WAS
AND I DID SO ONLY THAT I STRIPPED BEFORE I WENT FROM MY HUT HAVING NOTHING ON BUT MY CHEQUERED SHIRT A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS AND A PAIR OF PUMPS ON MY FEET
NEXT THE LIEUTENANT
ON THE CONCLUSION OF THIS WEIGHTY EVIDENCE THE GRAND MASTER IN A SOLEMN TONE DEMANDED OF REBECCA WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY AGAINST THE SENTENCE OF CONDEMNATION WHICH HE WAS ABOUT TO PRONOUNCE
THESE CREATURES WERE OF THE SIZE OF A LARGE MASTIFF BUT INFINITELY MORE NIMBLE AND FIERCE
I BEAR HIM WITNESS
IN THESE DIVERSIONS HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE AT THE CLOSET DOOR AS IF SOMEBODY WERE OPENING IT
RASPE YOU HAVE HEARD I DARE SAY OF THE HUNTER AND SPORTSMAN'S SAINT AND PROTECTOR ST HUBERT AND OF THE NOBLE STAG WHICH APPEARED TO HIM IN THE FOREST WITH THE HOLY CROSS BETWEEN HIS ANTLERS
THEY PUT A THOUSAND QUESTIONS RESPECTING MY COUNTRY
BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT THEY COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OTHER ONCE A YEAR HOWEVER WIDELY SEPARATE MIGHT BE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE FROM EACH OTHER
WHEN THE PRETENDED FATIMA HAD MADE HER OBEISANCE THE PRINCESS SAID MY GOOD MOTHER I HAVE ONE THING TO REQUEST WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE ME
SHE WAS SITTING ON A BROKEN STONE IN A STRANGE WILD DRESS AND ENGAGED IN SPINNING A THREAD DRAWN FROM WOOL OF THREE DIFFERENT COLOURS
HE SAID TO THE COELESTIAL GATE
BUT HE STOPPED HER AND SAID PRINCESS RETIRE TO YOUR APARTMENT AND LET ME BE LEFT ALONE WHILE I ENDEAVOR TO TRANSPORT YOU BACK TO CHINA AS SPEEDILY AS YOU WERE BROUGHT FROM THENCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HER WOMEN AND SLAVES WERE GONE OUT OF THE HALL ALADDIN SHUT THE DOOR AND GOING DIRECTLY TO THE DEAD BODY OF THE MAGICIAN OPENED HIS VEST TOOK OUT THE LAMP WHICH WAS CAREFULLY WRAPPED UP AND RUBBING IT THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED
BUT ERE MANY MINUTES HAD PASSED THE GIANT FORM OF FRONT-DE BOEUF TOTTERED LIKE AN OAK UNDER THE STEEL OF THE WOODMAN AND DROPPED TO THE GROUND
THE HAPPY FATHER EMBRACED HER WITH TEARS OF JOY
BUT ESPECIALLY TO MAKE HIM SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I SPOKE
THE SAILS WERE SPLIT INTO A THOUSAND PIECES AND THE SHIP WAS STRANDED
HAVING DONE ALL THIS I LEFT THEM THE NEXT DAY AND WENT ON BOARD THE SHIP
MOTHER SAID ALADDIN BE NOT AFRAID
I BANGED IT A GOOD WHILE WITH ONE OF MY SCULLS AND AT LAST FORCED IT TO LEAP OUT OF THE BOAT
SUCH BOOKS HAVE AN IMPORTANT PART IN MOULDING THE CHARACTER OF A PEOPLE
BUT I WAS SO EMBARRASSED WITH MY OWN FRIGHTFUL IDEAS OF THE THING THAT I FORMED NOTHING BUT DISMAL IMAGINATIONS TO MYSELF EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOW A GREAT WAY OFF
THAT IF I ONCE CAME IN THEIR POWER I SHOULD RUN A HAZARD OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND TO ONE OF BEING KILLED AND PERHAPS OF BEING EATEN
NO PERSON BUT YOURSELF IS PERMITTED TO LIFT THIS STONE OR ENTER THE CAVE
AS FOR MY FACE THE COLOR OF IT WAS REALLY NOT SO MULATTO-LIKE AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM A MAN NOT AT ALL CAREFUL OF IT AND LIVING WITHIN NINE OR TEN DEGREES OF THE EQUINOX
I SAW HIM WET THE TIP OF HIS LITTLE FINGER UPON HIS TONGUE AND TAKE UP ONE OF MY LARGEST PIECES AND THEN ANOTHER
AT THE OPPOSITE END WAS A PILE OF FAGGOTS SO ARRANGED AROUND A STAKE DEEPLY FIXED IN THE GROUND AS TO LEAVE A SPACE FOR THE VICTIM WHOM THEY WERE DESTINED TO CONSUME
YOUR MISDEMEANOURS HAVE BEEN ATONED BY THE LOYAL SERVICES YOU RENDERED MY DISTRESSED SUBJECTS BEFORE THE WALLS OF TORQUILSTONE AND THE RESCUE YOU HAVE THIS DAY AFFORDED YOUR SOVEREIGN
THE LAST TIME OF THESE TWO HAD WELLNIGH BEEN FATAL TO ME
STOCKINGS AND SHOES I HAD NONE BUT HAD MADE ME A PAIR OF SOMETHINGS I SCARCE KNEW WHAT TO CALL THEM LIKE BUSKINS TO FLAP OVER MY LEGS AND LACE ON EITHER SIDE LIKE SPATTERDASHES BUT OF A MOST BARBAROUS SHAPE AS INDEED WERE ALL THE REST OF MY CLOTHES
THUS ALADDIN WHILE HE PAID ALL RESPECT TO THE SULTAN WON BY HIS AFFABLE BEHAVIOR AND LIBERALITY THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
HE WAS MUCH TERRIFIED WHEN HE HEARD HIM REPEAT SOME LINES OF AN OLD SONG WHICH HE SAID HE HAD LEARNT IN HIS CHILDHOOD
AFTER A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION ON DIFFERENT SUBJECTS HE OFFERED AGAIN TO TAKE HIS LEAVE WHEN ALI BABA STOPPING HIM SAID WHERE ARE YOU GOING SIR IN SO MUCH HASTE
A VERY GOOD MOUTH THIN LIPS AND HIS FINE TEETH WELL SET AND AS WHITE AS IVORY
HE GAVE ANOTHER HUNDRED SEQUINS TO HINDBAD AND INVITED HIM TO DINNER AGAIN THE NEXT DAY TO HEAR
FROM EARLY YOUTH HE SUFFERED FROM SOME DISEASE OF THE BODY THAT MADE HIM CROSS AND IRRITABLE BUT HE WAS MUCH HONORED BY THE POOR PEOPLE OF IRELAND AS THEIR FRIEND AND CHAMPION
BY WHICH THE READER MAY CONCEIVE AN IDEA OF THE INGENUITY OF THAT PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE PRUDENT AND EXACT ECONOMY OF SO GREAT A PRINCE
BUT THE MAN PUT HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS AND RAN ON CRYING LIFE
HE WAS SITTING ON THE BANK OF A STREAM AND AT FIRST I TOOK HIM TO BE ONE WHO HAD BEEN SHIPWRECKED LIKE MYSELF
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE
FIRST THE CAPTAIN HIS MATE AND PASSENGER
WHILE ALI BABA TOOK THESE MEASURES THE CAPTAIN OF THE FORTY ROBBERS RETURNED TO THE FOREST WITH INCONCEIVABLE MORTIFICATION
BEFORE APPROACHING THE DOOR HE PEEPED IN THROUGH AN APERTURE IN THE RUINED WALL AND SAW IN THE ROOM INSIDE THE FIGURE OF A MAN STRETCHED ON A STRAW BED WITH A BLANKET THROWN OVER IT
I HEARD GLUMDALCLITCH GIVE A SHRIEK THE MOMENT HE WAS CARRYING ME OUT
ABOUT FOUR HOURS AFTER WE BEGAN OUR JOURNEY I AWAKED BY A VERY RIDICULOUS ACCIDENT
SO HE AS THE OTHER I SAW DID ASCEND THE HILL TO COME UP TO THE GATE ONLY HE CAME ALONE
WHEREFORE LET US AT LEAST TO AVOID THE SHAME THAT BECOMES NOT A CHRISTIAN TO BE FOUND IN BEAR UP WITH PATIENCE AS WELL AS WE CAN
SECONDLY
EVERY JOINT OF IT WAS WELL GROOVED
IN ATTEMPTING TO RUN AWAY I FELL UPON THE FARMER TO WHOM THE HAY BELONGED AND BROKE HIS NECK YET RECEIVED NO INJURY MYSELF
BUT THIS APPEARED IMPRACTICABLE
I SEE YOU WANT TO HAVE ME SPEAK OUT BUT YOU SHALL KNOW NO MORE THE ROBBER FELT SURE THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED WHAT HE SOUGHT
LIVING OR DEAD NOBLE ATHELSTANE SPEAK TO CEDRIC I WILL SAID THE SPECTRE WHEN I HAVE COLLECTED BREATH
AND BEING SHOWN THE HOUSE MARKED IT IN A PLACE MORE REMOTE FROM SIGHT WITH RED CHALK
I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP ALADDIN'S MOTHER TERRIFIED AT THE SIGHT OF THE GENIE FAINTED
BE PLEASED TO TAKE A SKETCH OF MY FIGURE AS FOLLOWS
I BECKONED TO HIM AGAIN TO COME TO ME AND GAVE HIM ALL THE SIGNS OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT I COULD THINK OF
JOY BE THE CONSEQUENCE AND OPENING IT HE FOUND FAIR PORTIA'S PORTRAIT INSIDE AND HE TURNED TO HER AND ASKED IF IT WERE TRUE THAT SHE WAS HIS
I HAD SENT SO MANY MEMORIALS AND PETITIONS FOR MY LIBERTY THAT HIS MAJESTY AT LENGTH MENTIONED THE MATTER FIRST IN THE CABINET AND THEN IN A FULL COUNCIL
AND ESPECIALLY I WAS UNWILLING TO HAZARD THE KILLING OF ANY OF OUR MEN KNOWING THE OTHERS WERE VERY WELL ARMED
BUT IT WAS MORE THAN HIS COURTIERS COULD DO TO ROUSE HIM FROM THE OVERPOWERING GLOOM WHICH SEEMED TO AGITATE HIS MIND THROUGHOUT THE EVENING
THUS I TOOK ALL THE MEASURES HUMAN PRUDENCE COULD SUGGEST FOR MY OWN PRESERVATION
HOWEVER HE MADE OTHER SIGNS TO LET ME UNDERSTAND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MEAT AND DRINK ENOUGH AND VERY GOOD TREATMENT
SINDBAD BADE HIM DRAW NEAR AND SEATING HIM AT HIS RIGHT HAND SERVED HIM HIMSELF AND GAVE HIM EXCELLENT WINE OF WHICH THERE WAS ABUNDANCE UPON THE SIDEBOARD
ORDERING HIM AT ALL EVENTS TO CAUSE THE NEW CAPTAIN WHO WAS KILLED TO BE HANGED AT THE YARD-ARM THAT THESE MEN MIGHT SEE HIM
AFTER TRAVERSING A DEEP AND DANGEROUS GLEN HE REACHED THE HOUSE FROM WHICH THE LIGHT SHONE
BUT COULD NOT FORGET THE ROC'S EGG WHICH SHE RESOLVED TO REQUEST OF ALADDIN WHEN NEXT HE SHOULD VISIT HER APARTMENTS
SO WITH THEM AND THE THREE HONEST MEN WE WERE SEVEN MEN WELL ARMED
HOWEVER WITH THE HELP OF PROSPERO'S GREAT ENEMY ALONSO KING OF NAPLES HE MANAGED TO GET INTO HIS HANDS THE DUKEDOM WITH ALL ITS HONOR POWER AND RICHES
THEN TO SEE HOW LIKE A KING I DINED TOO ALL ALONE ATTENDED BY MY SERVANTS
MY FRIEND RELDRESAL PRINCIPAL SECRETARY FOR PRIVATE AFFAIRS IS IN MY OPINION IF I AM NOT PARTIAL THE SECOND AFTER THE TREASURER
SO SUDDEN AND IRRESISTIBLE WAS THE ATTACK THAT GLOSSIN FELL THE BACK PART OF HIS NECK COMING FULL UPON THE IRON BAR WITH STUNNING VIOLENCE
A WOMAN CLAD IN A LONG CLOAK WAS SITTING BY THE BEDSIDE AND MOISTENING AT TIMES THE LIPS OF THE MAN WITH SOME LIQUID
AS SOON AS I PERCEIVED THEM GO TOWARDS THE SHORE I IMAGINED IT TO BE AS IT REALLY WAS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN OVER THEIR SEARCH AND WERE GOING BACK AGAIN AND THE CAPTAIN AS SOON AS I TOLD HIM MY THOUGHTS WAS READY TO SINK AT THE APPREHENSIONS OF IT
THERE WERE ALSO OF THEM THAT HAD WINGS AND THEY ANSWERED ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT INTERMISSION SAYING HOLY HOLY HOLY IS THE LORD
AND HAVING RETURNED TO ENGLAND WITH HIS REGIMENT AND BEING STILL DEEPLY DEVOTED TO MISS MANNERING HE HAD LOST NO TIME IN MAKING HIS WAY TO WHERE SHE WAS STAYING IN THE HOUSE OF MR MERVYN HER FATHER'S FRIEND
AND BESIDES I COUNT THAT THE PRINCE UNDER WHOSE BANNER NOW I STAND IS ABLE TO ABSOLVE ME
THERE IS NO PRINCE THAT WILL THUS LIGHTLY LOSE HIS SUBJECTS NEITHER WILL I AS YET LOSE THEE
I HAD NEITHER THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH THE LUSTS OF THE EYE NOR THE PRIDE OF LIFE
BUT I WILL PREVENT HIM MORGIANA WHILE THEY WERE AT SUPPER DETERMINED IN HER OWN MIND TO EXECUTE ONE OF THE BOLDEST ACTS EVER MEDITATED
THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM AND MY CASTLE THE CREEK WHICH I MENTIONED OFTEN IN THE FIRST PART OF MY STORY WHERE I LANDED MY CARGOES OUT OF THE SHIP AND THIS I SAW PLAINLY HE MUST NECESSARILY SWIM OVER OR THE POOR WRETCH WOULD BE TAKEN THERE
AND IF THAT HAPPENED TO BE THE CASE WE RESOLVED TO STAY IN THAT ISLAND AND NOT TO RISK OUR LIVES UPON THE RAFTS
THE WOOD WAS AGAIN SEARCHED WITH THE RESULT THAT TRACES OF A STRUGGLE WERE FOUND NEAR THE TOP OF THE CLIFF OVER THE PLACE WHERE KENNEDY'S BODY WAS FOUND LYING
I AM HIS SERVANT AND I WILL FOLLOW HIM
BUT WHEN I WAS ALMOST GONE AND ABLE TO STRUGGLE NO LONGER I FOUND MYSELF WITHIN MY DEPTH
WHEREUPON MY CHAINS WERE IMMEDIATELY UNLOCKED AND I WAS AT FULL LIBERTY
THERE YOUR EYES SHALL BE DELIGHTED WITH SEEING AND YOUR EARS WITH HEARING THE PLEASANT VOICE OF THE MIGHTY ONE
WE THEN SET SAIL AND HAD A GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE PASSED THE STRAITS OF MADAGASCAR
WRETCHED WOMAN HE EXCLAIMED AS SHE CONCLUDED HER MISERABLE HISTORY SO THOU HAST LIVED WHEN ALL BELIEVED THEE MURDERED
BUT THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT WE WERE DRIVEN DIRECTLY UPON IT AND IMMEDIATELY SPLIT
COME HERE
WHILE THESE REFLECTIONS WERE ROLLING IN MY MIND I WAS VERY THANKFUL IN MY THOUGHTS THAT I WAS SO HAPPY AS NOT TO BE THEREABOUTS AT THAT TIME OR THAT THEY DID NOT SEE MY BOAT BY WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THAT SOME INHABITANTS HAD BEEN IN THE PLACE AND PERHAPS HAVE SEARCHED FARTHER FOR ME
THE SIGHT OF ALL THESE RICHES MADE HIM SUPPOSE THAT THIS CAVE MUST HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED FOR AGES BY ROBBERS WHO HAD SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER
THE MOUNTAIN AT THE FOOT OF WHICH WE WERE WAS COVERED WITH WRECKS WITH A VAST NUMBER OF HUMAN BONES AND WITH AN INCREDIBLE QUANTITY OF GOODS AND RICHES OF ALL KINDS
AT LENGTH A BRIGHT IDEA OCCURRED TO ME
BUT THIS I CONCEIVED WAS TO BE THE LEAST OF MY MISFORTUNES
THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF THIS AFFAIR WAS THAT IN SPITE OF THE AWFUL DEPTH TO WHICH THEY HAD FALLEN NO ONE WAS HURT NOT EVEN THE HORSES IF WE EXCEPT A FEW SLIGHT CONTUSIONS
WHEN HE HAD CONSIDERED US WELL HE ADVANCED TOWARD US AND LAYING HIS HAND UPON ME TOOK ME UP BY THE NAPE OF MY NECK AND TURNED ME ROUND AS A BUTCHER WOULD DO A SHEEP'S HEAD
THE CARPENTER CAME AND IN A FEW MINUTES SAWED A PASSAGE ABOUT FOUR FEET SQUARE THEN LET DOWN A SMALL LADDER UPON WHICH I MOUNTED AND THENCE WAS TAKEN INTO THE SHIP IN A VERY WEAK CONDITION
THAT THEY HAD ALL PLANTATIONS AS WELL AS I AND FOR WHICH THEY NEEDED NOTHING SO MUCH AS SERVANTS
WHEN THEY HAD MADE THE EXCHANGE THE COUNTRYMAN WENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND ALADDIN ENTERED THE NEIGHBORING CITY
HER NOSE FAULTLESS
MORGIANA SAID HE I GAVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY AND THEN PROMISED YOU THAT MY GRATITUDE SHOULD NOT STOP THERE BUT THAT I WOULD SOON GIVE YOU HIGHER PROOFS OF ITS SINCERITY WHICH I NOW DO BY MAKING YOU MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HIS SON HE SAID
ETERNAL LIFE SO HE LOOKED NOT BEHIND HIM BUT FLED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAIN
THE TWO PIECES OF GOLD WERE GREAT TEMPTATIONS TO BABA MUSTAPHA
BEING MUCH FATIGUED HE TOOK OFF HIS LOAD AND SAT UPON IT NEAR A LARGE MANSION
SHE LED THEM BY A LONG AND WINDING PASSAGE ALMOST OVERGROWN WITH BRUSHWOOD UNTIL THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES BY THE SEASHORE
NOW THE PROPERTY IN ELLANGOWAN HAD BEEN WHAT IS CALLED SETTLED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT COULD NOT BE SOLD IF MR BERTRAM HAD A SON LIVING
BESIDES THIS I HAD MY COUNTRY-SEAT AND I HAD NOW A TOLERABLE PLANTATION THERE ALSO
GOD BE PRAISED SAID HE EMBRACING ME
MY HOURS OF LEISURE I SPENT IN READING THE BEST AUTHORS ANCIENT AND MODERN BEING ALWAYS PROVIDED WITH A GOOD NUMBER OF BOOKS
HE DESCENDED FROM THE STAGE AND COMMANDED THAT SEVERAL LADDERS SHOULD BE APPLIED TO MY SIDES ON WHICH ABOVE AN HUNDRED OF THE INHABITANTS MOUNTED AND WALKED TOWARDS MY MOUTH LADEN WITH BASKETS FULL OF MEAT WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED AND SENT THITHER BY THE KING'S ORDERS UPON THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE HE RECEIVED OF ME
BUT THE NOISE WAS SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT AT FIRST I CERTAINLY THOUGHT IT WAS THUNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ADDED TO THE REFRESHMENT I HAD RECEIVED BY THEIR VICTUALS AND DRINK WHICH WERE VERY NOURISHING DISPOSED ME TO SLEEP
SHE ALWAYS STANDS UP FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE BREAKING UP OF THE AUDIENCE AND AFFECTS TO PLACE HERSELF JUST BEFORE ME
EXCEPT MONDAYS AND FRIDAYS SHE NEVER STIRS OUT OF HER LITTLE CELL
I MADE EVERY REMONSTRANCE I COULD TO THE KING NOT TO EXPOSE ME A FOREIGNER TO THIS INHUMAN LAW
AND PULLING OUT MY GLASS I LOOKED AND SAW PLAINLY THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BUT NO APPEARANCE OF THEM OR THEIR CANOES
FOR MY PART I KNOW NOT WHETHER IS BEST TO LIVE THUS OR TO DIE OUT OF HAND
AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CAVE WHERE THE TROOP WAITED FOR HIM SAID NOW COMRADES NOTHING CAN PREVENT OUR FULL REVENGE AS I AM CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
THEN SAID THE INTERPRETER TO CHRISTIAN LET THIS MAN'S MISERY BE REMEMBERED BY THEE AND BE AN EVERLASTING CAUTION TO THEE
OUR PROVISIONS HELD OUT WELL OUR SHIP WAS STANCH AND OUR CREW ALL IN GOOD HEALTH
AS THERE WAS A DOOR OR ENTRANCE THERE INTO MY CAVE I MADE A FORMAL FRAMED DOOR-CASE AND A DOOR TO IT OF BOARDS AND SET IT UP IN THE PASSAGE A LITTLE WITHIN THE ENTRANCE
AFTER WHICH HE TOOK HIS LEAVE WITH AS MUCH POLITENESS AS IF HE HAD BEEN BRED UP AND HAD ALWAYS LIVED AT COURT
AND AFTER HE HAD MADE ALL HIS TROOP ENTER BEFORE HIM HE FOLLOWED THEM WHEN THE DOOR SHUT AGAIN OF ITSELF
LOOK INTO ALL THE OTHER JARS ALI BABA EXAMINED ALL THE OTHER JARS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
AT ONE END OF THE LISTS AROSE THE THRONE OF THE GRAND MASTER SURROUNDED WITH SEATS FOR THE PRECEPTORS AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ORDER OVER WHICH FLOATED THE SACRED STANDARD OF THE TEMPLARS
THE NATIVES CAME BY DEGREES TO BE LESS APPREHENSIVE OF ANY DANGER FROM ME
THEN BEHOLD
THEY WERE SURPRISED TO SEE ME BUT MORE SO AT HEARING THE PARTICULARS OF MY ADVENTURES
OR IN SHORT THAT THE ISLAND WAS INHABITED AND I MIGHT BE SURPRISED BEFORE I WAS AWARE
THAT I HAD LIVED THERE FIFTEEN YEARS NOW AND HAD NOT MET WITH THE LEAST SHADOW OR FIGURE OF ANY PEOPLE YET
PERHAPS YOU DO NOT LIKE YOUR FATHER'S AND WOULD PREFER ANOTHER
SO THE POOR CREATURE LAY DOWN AND WENT TO SLEEP
IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE TO TRY AND PUT OURSELVES IN THE CHILD'S PLACE
THEREFORE HE WAS OBLIGED TO BRING HIM HOME WITH HIM TO HIS MOTHER'S WHERE AFTER THE JEW HAD EXAMINED THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAY HE LAID DOWN TEN PIECES OF GOLD WITH WHICH ALADDIN WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED
THEN HE GAVE HIM A PARCHMENT-ROLL AND THERE WAS WRITTEN WITHIN FLY FROM THE WRATH TO COME
THIS STRANGER WAS A SORCERER KNOWN AS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN AS HE HAD BEEN BUT TWO DAYS ARRIVED FROM AFRICA HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
AND WHEN I PRESSED HIM TO TAKE MORE WITHOUT FEAR OF DOING ME ANY INJURY NO SAID HE I AM VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS WHICH IS VALUABLE ENOUGH TO SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF MAKING ANY MORE VOYAGES AND WILL RAISE AS GREAT A FORTUNE AS I DESIRE I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THE MERCHANTS TO WHOM I RELATED MY STORY A SECOND TIME FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THOSE WHO HAD NOT HEARD IT
ENCOURAGING MYSELF THEREFORE WITH THE BELIEF THAT THIS WAS NOTHING BUT THE PRINT OF ONE OF MY OWN FEET AND THAT I MIGHT BE TRULY SAID TO START AT MY OWN SHADOW I BEGAN TO GO ABROAD AGAIN AND WENT TO MY COUNTRY HOUSE TO MILK MY FLOCK
RASPE SOME YEARS BEFORE MY BEARD ANNOUNCED APPROACHING MANHOOD OR IN OTHER WORDS WHEN I WAS NEITHER MAN NOR BOY BUT BETWEEN BOTH I EXPRESSED IN REPEATED CONVERSATIONS A STRONG DESIRE OF SEEING THE WORLD FROM WHICH I WAS DISCOURAGED BY MY PARENTS THOUGH MY FATHER HAD BEEN NO INCONSIDERABLE TRAVELLER HIMSELF
THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY MEN IN THE SHIP
WHILE OTHERS SUFFERING FROM DISEASE STOOPED FOR HIM TO LAY HIS HANDS UPON THEM WHICH HE DID MUTTERING SOME WORDS IN FORM OF PRAYER AND IN SHORT COUNTERFEITING SO WELL THAT EVERYBODY TOOK HIM FOR THE HOLY WOMAN
THEY NEVER MET WITHOUT SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER AND SCOLDED EACH OTHER SO DREADFULLY THAT ALL THEIR LITTLE FAIRY FOLLOWERS FOR FEAR WOULD CREEP INTO ACORN CUPS AND HIDE THEM THERE
LEAPING INTO THE SADDLE OF THE RICHLY-ACCOUTRED STEED WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM HE RODE UP TO WHERE THE LADY ROWENA WAS SEATED AND HEEDLESS OF THE MANY NORMAN BEAUTIES WHO GRACED THE CONTEST WITH THEIR PRESENCE GRACEFULLY SINKING THE POINT OF HIS LANCE HE DEPOSITED THE CORONET WHICH IT SUPPORTED AT THE FEET OF THE FAIR SAXON
THE FOURSCORE SLAVES WERE CONDUCTED INTO THE PALACE
ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO BABA MUSTAPHA WHO DID HIM THE SAME SERVICE HE HAD DONE TO THE OTHER ROBBERS
BY HIS ART HE SET FREE THE IMPRISONED SPIRITS YET KEPT THEM OBEDIENT TO HIS WILL AND THEY WERE MORE TRULY HIS SUBJECTS THAN HIS PEOPLE IN MILAN HAD BEEN
NOW THEIR WAY LAY JUST UPON THE BANK OF THE RIVER
LET HIM HAVE A BOARD AND A MORSEL APART INTRODUCED WITH LITTLE CEREMONY AND ADVANCING WITH FEAR AND HESITATION AND MANY A BOW OF DEEP HUMILITY A TALL THIN OLD MAN WITH AN AQUILINE NOSE AND PIERCING BLACK EYES APPROACHED THE LOWER END OF THE BOARD
SOME OF THE MEN MUTTERED ANGRY REMARKS AS HE PASSED THEM ON THE ROAD BUT HE THOUGHT IT BEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER
WHEN HE REACHED IT AND WENT IN HE FOUND HATTERAICK IN THE DARK AND SHIVERING WITH COLD
MEG MERRILIES HAD HOWEVER LAGGED BEHIND THE REST AND WAS STANDING ALONE ON A HIGH BANK ABOVE THE ROAD AS THE LAIRD WENT BY
WHICH I CAN ASSERT UPON EXPERIENCE HAVING BEEN SO CURIOUS TO WEIGH AND MEASURE THEM
I GOT UP IMMEDIATELY AND OBSERVING THE GOOD PEOPLE TO BE IN MUCH CONCERN I TOOK MY HAT WHICH I HELD UNDER MY ARM OUT OF GOOD MANNERS AND WAVING IT OVER MY HEAD GAVE THREE HUZZAS TO SHOW I HAD GOT NO MISCHIEF BY MY FALL
THOU ART A STRANGER AND CANST NOT LEAVE THE CASTLE WITHOUT A GUIDE
FOR AS HERE THOU SEEST PASSION WILL HAVE ALL NOW THIS YEAR THAT IS TO SAY IN THIS WORLD
I HAILED HER BUT COULD GET NO ANSWER
THEREFORE GOOD WOMAN GO AND TELL HIM SO AND I WILL WAIT TILL YOU BRING ME HIS ANSWER ALADDIN'S MOTHER PROSTRATED HERSELF A SECOND TIME BEFORE THE SULTAN'S THRONE AND RETIRED
THEY CAME AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES FOR MORE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME HAD NOT FINISHED HALF THEIR WORK
GIVE ME THAT LITTLE INDIAN BOY AND I WILL AGAIN BE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT AND SUITOR SET YOUR MIND AT REST SAID THE QUEEN
AND NO MEN OF WHAT KIND SOEVER COULD EVER IMAGINE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING BEYOND IT MUCH LESS A HABITATION
I REALIZED VAST SUMS BY MY IVORY BOUGHT SEVERAL RARITIES WHICH I INTENDED FOR PRESENTS AND WHEN MY EQUIPAGE WAS READY SET OUT IN COMPANY WITH A LARGE CARAVAN OF MERCHANTS
BUT I BEG OF YOUR MAJESTY TO GRANT ME THREE MONTHS BEFORE YOU COME TO A FINAL RESOLUTION
YES DEAR SIR I AM THE MAN
ALI BABA FOLLOWED THEM WITH HIS EYES AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE THEM AND AFTERWARD STAYED A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE HE DESCENDED
THE LOWER PART OF THE HALL WAS FILLED WITH GUARDS AND OTHERS WHOM CURIOSITY HAD DRAWN TOGETHER TO WITNESS THE IMPORTANT AND IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY
WE WENT AFTERWARD TOGETHER TO THE FOREST WHERE WE DUG A HOLE FOR THE ELEPHANT
ALI BABA WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CAVE AND COLLECTED AS MUCH OF THE GOLD COIN WHICH WAS IN BAGS AS HE THOUGHT HIS THREE ASSES COULD CARRY
THE VEINS AND ARTERIES SPOUTED UP SUCH A PRODIGIOUS QUANTITY OF BLOOD AND SO HIGH IN THE AIR THAT THE GREAT FOUNTAIN AT VERSAILLES WAS NOT EQUAL FOR THE TIME IT LASTED
AND THE FAIRY KING AND QUEEN LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER IN THAT VERY WOOD AT THIS VERY DAY
SOME YEARS LATER HE CARRIED HIS SON TO THE CAVE AND TAUGHT HIM THE SECRET WHICH DESCENDED TO HIS POSTERITY WHO USING THEIR GOOD FORTUNE WITH MODERATION LIVED IN HONOR AND SPLENDOR
WE CAME BACK TO OUR CASTLE AND THERE I FELL TO WORK FOR MY MAN FRIDAY
NEITHER WHEN I KILLED THEM COULD I TELL WHAT WAS FIT FOR FOOD AND WHAT NOT
AND IN A WORD I GOT ALL THIS SAFE ON SHORE ALSO
AS SOON AS THE CROWD SAW THE ATTENDANTS FROM THE PALACE THEY MADE WAY
WELL NEIGHBOR OBSTINATE SAID PLIABLE I INTEND TO GO ALONG WITH THIS GOOD MAN AND TO CAST IN MY LOT WITH HIM
THE SIXTH VOYAGE I KNOW MY FRIENDS THAT YOU WILL WISH TO HEAR HOW AFTER HAVING BEEN SHIPWRECKED FIVE TIMES AND ESCAPED SO MANY DANGERS I COULD RESOLVE AGAIN TO TEMPT FORTUNE AND EXPOSE MYSELF TO NEW HARDSHIPS
THE PRINCESS GRANTED HIS REQUEST SAYING YOU MAY BE AS FREE HERE GOOD MOTHER AS IF YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN CELL
HOWEVER HE WAS AT LENGTH PERSUADED TO COMPLY
AND I MADE A FORMAL WILL DISPOSING OF MY PLANTATION AND EFFECTS IN CASE OF MY DEATH MAKING THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THAT HAD SAVED MY LIFE AS BEFORE MY UNIVERSAL HEIR BUT OBLIGING HIM TO DISPOSE OF MY EFFECTS AS I HAD DIRECTED IN MY WILL ONE-HALF OF THE PRODUCE BEING TO HIMSELF AND THE OTHER TO BE SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
BUT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT HE IS THE GREATEST ROGUE EVEN AMONG THE JEWS
HIS MAJESTY DESIRED I WOULD TAKE SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITY OF BRINGING ALL THE REST OF HIS ENEMY'S SHIPS INTO HIS PORTS
THE ADVICE GIVEN HIM WAS TO READ ROBINSON CRUSOE CAREFULLY
ALSO THIS GIANT HAS WOUNDED ME AS WELL AS THEE AND HATH ALSO CUT OFF THE BREAD AND WATER FROM MY MOUTH
ALL STOOD UP TO RECEIVE HER AND REPLYING TO THEIR COURTESY BY A MUTE GESTURE OF SALUTATION SHE MOVED GRACEFULLY FORWARD TO ASSUME HER PLACE AT THE BOARD WHILE THE EYES OF BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT SEEMED TO BE RIVETED BY THE STRIKING BEAUTY OF HER FACE
AT THE INSTANT THAT THE GENIE HAD SET DOWN THE COUCH WITH THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM IN THEIR OWN CHAMBER THE SULTAN CAME TO THE DOOR TO OFFER HIS GOOD WISHES TO HIS DAUGHTER
I WENT ONE DAY TO A WORKMAN AND GAVE HIM A MODEL FOR MAKING THE STOCK OF A SADDLE
BUT THE NOISE AND ASTONISHMENT OF THE PEOPLE AT SEEING ME RISE AND WALK ARE NOT TO BE EXPRESSED
AND BEFORE LONG HE FOUND THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKEN
THE APPOINTED HOUR FOR THE AUCTION AT LENGTH ARRIVED BUT COLONEL MANNERING HAD NOT COME BACK
THE CAPTAIN MADE A VERY JUST PROPOSAL TO ME UPON THIS CONSULTATION OF THEIRS VIZ THAT PERHAPS THEY WOULD ALL FIRE A VOLLEY AGAIN TO ENDEAVOR TO MAKE THEIR FELLOWS HEAR AND THAT WE SHOULD ALL SALLY UPON THEM JUST AT THE JUNCTURE WHEN THEIR PIECES WERE ALL DISCHARGED AND THEY WOULD CERTAINLY YIELD AND WE SHOULD HAVE THEM WITHOUT BLOODSHED
SO HOPEFUL BEING PERSUADED BY HIS FELLOW WENT AFTER HIM OVER THE STILE
BUT ALL I COULD MAKE USE OF WAS ALL THAT WAS VALUABLE
AND PATIENCE OF THE MEN OF THAT WHICH IS TO COME
WHEN I SHOWED MYSELF TO THE TWO HOSTAGES IT WAS WITH THE CAPTAIN WHO TOLD THEM I WAS THE PERSON THE GOVERNOR HAD ORDERED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AND THAT IT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S PLEASURE THEY SHOULD NOT STIR ANYWHERE BUT AT MY DIRECTION
UNDOUBTEDLY PHILOSOPHERS ARE IN THE RIGHT WHEN THEY TELL US THAT NOTHING IS GREAT OR LITTLE OTHERWISE THAN BY COMPARISON
THE HEAVY STEP OF MEN-AT-ARMS TRAVERSED THE BATTLEMENTS OR RESOUNDED ON THE NARROW AND WINDING PASSAGES AND THE STAIRS WHICH LED TO THE VARIOUS BARTIZANS AND POINTS OF DEFENCE
SO HE FUMBLED IN HIS BOSOM FOR ONE AND FOUND NONE
THE SULTAN CONSENTED WITH PLEASURE ROSE UP IMMEDIATELY AND PRECEDED BY THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS OF HIS PALACE AND FOLLOWED BY ALL THE GREAT LORDS OF HIS COURT ACCOMPANIED ALADDIN
HIS MOST SUBLIME MAJESTY PROPOSES TO THE MAN MOUNTAIN LATELY ARRIVED TO OUR CELESTIAL DOMINIONS THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES WHICH BY A SOLEMN OATH HE SHALL BE OBLIGED TO PERFORM
HER MAJESTY SAID IF I WOULD CONTRIVE A BOAT HER OWN JOINER SHOULD MAKE IT AND SHE WOULD PROVIDE A PLACE FOR ME TO SAIL IN
IN ANOTHER I FOUND ABOUT THIRTY-SIX POUNDS VALUE IN MONEY--SOME EUROPEAN COIN SOME BRAZIL SOME PIECES OF EIGHT SOME GOLD AND SOME SILVER
HE DID NOT SET ANY PARTICULAR MARK ON THE HOUSE BUT EXAMINED AND OBSERVED IT SO CAREFULLY BY PASSING OFTEN BY IT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MISTAKE IT
LOOK DOTH IT NOT GO ALONG BY THE WAY-SIDE
FOR THE AGREEABLE SMELL OF WOOD OF ALOES AND OF PASTILS THAT CAME FROM THE HOUSE MIXING WITH THE SCENT OF THE ROSE-WATER COMPLETELY PERFUMED AND EMBALMED THE AIR
BUT THAT IF THEY WOULD JOIN IN SO JUST AN ATTEMPT AS TO RECOVER THE SHIP HE WOULD HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S ENGAGEMENT FOR THEIR PARDON
THE NEXT DAY I WAS OBLIGED TO GO AWAY ON DUTY AND DID NOT RETURN HOME FOR A FORTNIGHT
AND NOW I SAW THOUGH TOO LATE THE FOLLY OF BEGINNING A WORK BEFORE WE COUNT THE COST AND BEFORE WE JUDGE RIGHTLY OF OUR OWN STRENGTH TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
AND I RESOLVED TO MAKE ANOTHER VOYAGE ON BOARD THE VESSEL IF POSSIBLE
THE CEREMONY BEING OVER THE MOUTH OF THE PIT WAS AGAIN COVERED WITH THE STONE AND THE COMPANY RETURNED
FINDING THAT HE DID NOT PRESS ME AS BEFORE I THREW HIM UPON THE GROUND WHERE HE LAY WITHOUT MOTION
CEDRIC NODDED COLDLY IN ANSWER TO HIS REPEATED SALUTATIONS AND SIGNED TO HIM TO TAKE A PLACE AT THE LOWER END OF THE TABLE WHERE HOWEVER NO ONE OFFERED TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM
HE WOULD FORCE A RICH PRESENT UPON ME
I WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED WITH HIM AND MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO TEACH HIM EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROPER TO MAKE HIM USEFUL HANDY AND HELPFUL

ON WHICH THE SULTANESS ENJOINED ON HER THE NECESSITY OF SILENCE AND DISCRETION AS NO ONE WOULD GIVE CREDENCE TO SO STRANGE A TALE
GLUMDALCLITCH HAD LOCKED ME UP IN HER CLOSET WHILE SHE WENT SOMEWHERE UPON BUSINESS OR A VISIT
I CANNOT MAKE THE CHOICE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF SATISFYING YOUR EXORBITANT DEMAND SEIZE HIM AND STRIP HIM SLAVES SAID THE KNIGHT AND LET THE FATHERS OF HIS RACE ASSIST HIM IF THEY CAN THE ASSISTANTS STEPPED FORWARD AND LAYING HANDS ON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN WAITED THE HARDHEARTED BARON'S FURTHER SIGNAL
I WILL MANACLE YOUR NECK AND FEET TOGETHER AND YOU SHALL FEED ON FRESH WATER MUSSELS WITHERED ROOTS AND HUSK AND HAVE SEA-WATER TO DRINK
WHEN THIS SHOWER OF ARROWS WAS OVER I FELL A-GROANING WITH GRIEF AND PAIN AND THEN STRIVING AGAIN TO GET LOOSE THEY DISCHARGED ANOTHER VOLLEY LARGER THAN THE FIRST AND SOME OF THEM ATTEMPTED WITH SPEARS TO STICK ME IN THE SIDES
IN OUR VOYAGE WE TOUCHED AT SEVERAL ISLANDS WHERE WE SOLD OR EXCHANGED OUR GOODS
THEY HEARD ME AND SENT A BOAT TO BRING ME ON BOARD
IF YOU SHOULD EVER HAVE ANY STORY OF YOUR OWN TO TELL AND WANT TO TELL IT WELL I ADVISE YOU TO TAKE ROBINSON CRUSOE FOR A MODEL PARENTS AND TEACHERS WHO DO NOT READ ALOUD TO YOUNG CHILDREN OR WHO DO NOT PRACTISE TELLING STORIES TO CHILDREN PROBABLY DO NOT REALIZE WHAT SIMPLE BUT EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF-EDUCATION THEY ARE IGNORING TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HELP THEY CAN BE TO CHILDREN
BUT TO RETURN TO THE ASSAULT
THE PRINCESS WHO HAD LONG HEARD OF THIS HOLY WOMAN BUT HAD NEVER SEEN HER WAS VERY DESIROUS TO HAVE SOME CONVERSATION WITH HER
THEY HALLOOED AGAIN AND CALLED THEIR TWO COMRADES BY THEIR NAMES A GREAT MANY TIMES
AND HORSE AND MAN WENT HEAVILY TO THE GROUND
HE QUICKLY LAID AS MANY BAGS OF GOLD AS HE COULD CARRY AT THE DOOR OF THE CAVERN
THE SUFFERER WAS IVANHOE HIMSELF WHO HAD SO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE TOURNAMENT WHEN HIS FATHER CEDRIC HAD SENT HIS SERVANTS TO ATTEND HIM TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY WITH A READING GUIDE BY WILLIAM ALLAN NEILSON PH.D
ON HIS SON-IN-LAW BEING BROUGHT BEFORE HIM HE WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD FROM HIM BUT ORDERED HIM TO BE PUT TO DEATH
ALADDIN DID NOT CONFINE HIMSELF IN HIS PALACE BUT WENT WITH MUCH STATE SOMETIMES TO ONE MOSQUE AND SOMETIMES TO ANOTHER TO PRAYERS OR TO VISIT THE GRAND VIZIER OR THE PRINCIPAL LORDS OF THE COURT
AND SINCE HIS DEATH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I CAN SAY TO HIM HE DOES NOTHING BUT IDLE AWAY HIS TIME IN THE STREETS AS YOU SAW HIM WITHOUT CONSIDERING HE IS NO LONGER A CHILD
BROWN THOUGH A SOLDIER AND A BRAVE ONE WAS TERRIFIED AS HE LAY IN HIS HIDING-PLACE
NOW NIGHT BEING COME AGAIN AND THE GIANT AND HIS WIFE BEING IN BED SHE ASKED HIM CONCERNING THE PRISONERS AND IF THEY HAD TAKEN HIS COUNSEL
IT WAS A VERY KIND AND AGREEABLE PRESENT AS ANY ONE MAY IMAGINE TO ONE IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT NEVER WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD OF THAT KIND SO UNPLEASANT AWKWARD AND UNEASY AS IT WAS TO ME TO WEAR SUCH CLOTHES AT FIRST
THEY RIPPED IT OPEN AND AFTER EXAMINING THE CONTENTS WHICH INCLUDED ALL THE OWNER'S READY MONEY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A TRIFLING SUM IN HIS POCKET THEY DIVIDED THE WHOLE AMONGST THEM
AND I MADE THE OTHER TWO CARRY PROVISIONS TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE WHERE FRIDAY WAS TO TAKE THEM
BUT AS I CAME NEARER I PERCEIVED PRESENTLY HE HAD A BOW AND ARROW AND WAS FITTING IT TO SHOOT AT ME
I TOOK HIM UP AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND ENCOURAGED HIM ALL I COULD
BESIDES HE HEARD FROM WITHIN A CONCERT OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ACCOMPANIED WITH THE HARMONIOUS NOTES OF NIGHTINGALES AND OTHER BIRDS
IT STUNNED HIM HE STAGGERED--YET HE MADE OFF AND I LOST SIGHT OF HIM TO MY CHAGRIN
SHOOTING A STAG WITH CHERRY-STONES BY R
THEY ARE COMING SAID SHE TO BROWN
UPON THIS I AWAKED FROM MY SLEEP
HIS DESIGN IS TO KILL YOU THEREFORE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AFTER THESE WORDS THE GENIE DISAPPEARED
THE NORMAN'S SPEAR STRIKING THE CENTRE OF HIS ANTAGONIST'S SHIELD WENT TO SHIVERS AND THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT REELED IN HIS SADDLE
ALI BABA RECEIVED COGIA HOUSSAIN WITH A SMILING COUNTENANCE AND IN THE MOST OBLIGING MANNER HE COULD WISH
BUT HE HARSHLY REFUSED HER AND MADE FERDINAND FOLLOW HIM TO HIS CELL
BUT THE CHARGE OF MAINTAINING ME ALTHOUGH I HAD A VERY SCANTY ALLOWANCE BEING TOO GREAT FOR A NARROW FORTUNE I WAS BOUND APPRENTICE TO MR JAMES BATES AN EMINENT SURGEON IN LONDON WITH WHOM I CONTINUED FOUR YEARS
BUT SHORTLY SAW AT A DISTANCE SUCH OBJECTS AS GREATLY DIMINISHED MY SATISFACTION AND WHICH I COULD NOT VIEW WITHOUT TERROR NAMELY A GREAT NUMBER OF SERPENTS SO MONSTROUS THAT THE LEAST OF THEM WAS CAPABLE OF SWALLOWING AN ELEPHANT
SUCH IS THE UNEVEN STATE OF HUMAN LIFE
AT BREAK OF DAY THE GENIE APPEARED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR BRINGING BACK THE BRIDEGROOM WHOM BY BREATHING UPON HE HAD LEFT MOTIONLESS AND ENTRANCED AT THE DOOR OF ALADDIN'S CHAMBER DURING THE NIGHT
HER LIPS VERMILION
PLACE FOR THE LADY ROWENA AS HE SPOKE A SIDE-DOOR AT THE UPPER END OF THE HALL OPENED AND ROWENA THE FAIR AND STATELY WARD OF CEDRIC FOLLOWED BY FOUR FEMALE ATTENDANTS ENTERED THE APARTMENT
I KNEW HIM AND YOU NOW FIND THAT MY SUSPICION WAS NOT GROUNDLESS ALI BABA WHO IMMEDIATELY FELT THE NEW OBLIGATION HE HAD TO MORGIANA FOR SAVING HIS LIFE A SECOND TIME EMBRACED HER
ALSO IT THUNDRED AND LIGHTNED IN MOST FEARFUL WISE THAT IT PUT ME INTO AN AGONY
THERE IS LIKEWISE ANOTHER DIVERSION WHICH IS ONLY SHOWN BEFORE THE EMPEROR AND EMPRESS AND FIRST MINISTER UPON PARTICULAR OCCASIONS
AT HIS SUGGESTION YOUR WIFE MAKES THIS PERNICIOUS DEMAND
GLOSSIN HAD HOWEVER IMPRESSED THE OLD MAN WITH A FIXED IDEA OF THE IMPENDING DANGER TO HIS HOUSE AND HE REFUSED TO ALLOW THE SOLDIERS TO GO
AND SHE HAD THE FINE AND SECRET JOY OF KNOWING THAT ALL HIS LOVE-WORDS CAME TO THE RIGHT EARS
TO THE OLDER BOYS AND GIRLS IT IS A STORY OF STIRRING ADVENTURE WHILE TO THE MATURE MAN IT IS A PICTURE OF CIVILIZATION
I WAS FOURTEEN MORE GETTING THE BRANCHES AND LIMBS AND THE VAST SPREADING HEAD CUT OFF WHICH I HACKED AND HEWED THROUGH WITH AXE AND HATCHET AND INEXPRESSIBLE LABOR
A SHORT CONSULTATION THEN TOOK PLACE BETWEEN BEAUMANOIR AND THE PRECEPTORS IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED THAT BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT WAS THE FITTEST KNIGHT TO DO BATTLE FOR THE HOLY ORDER
NOW I BEGAN TO TAKE COURAGE AND TO PEEP ABROAD AGAIN FOR I HAD NOT STIRRED OUT OF MY CASTLE FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SO THAT I BEGAN TO STARVE FOR PROVISIONS
WHEN I ATTENDED THE KING AFTER MY RECOVERY TO RETURN HIM THANKS FOR HIS FAVORS HE WAS PLEASED TO RALLY ME A GOOD DEAL UPON THIS ADVENTURE
ALI BABA'S SON DID NOT CHOOSE TO LIE UNDER SUCH OBLIGATION TO COGIA HOUSSAIN
THUS THE CAPTAIN AND HIS TROOP WERE FORCED TO RETIRE A SECOND TIME AND MUCH MORE DISSATISFIED
IT COST ME NEAR THREE MONTHS MORE TO CLEAR THE INSIDE AND WORK IT OUT SO AS TO MAKE AN EXACT BOAT OF IT
WITH QUICK LONG STRIDES THE GIPSY PROCEEDED STRAIGHT ACROSS THE WINTRY HEATH
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF THAT SAYS THE CAPTAIN WITH ALL MY HEART WELL SAYS I I WILL SEND FOR THEM UP AND TALK WITH THEM FOR YOU SO I CAUSED FRIDAY AND THE TWO HOSTAGES--FOR THEY WERE NOW DISCHARGED THEIR COMRADES HAVING PERFORMED THEIR PROMISE--I SAY I CAUSED THEM TO GO TO THE CAVE AND BRING UP THE FIVE MEN PINIONED AS THEY WERE TO THE BOWER AND KEEP THEM THERE TILL I CAME
THIRDLY
AS HE APPROACHED THE CASTLE GATE HE WAS AT ONCE ADMITTED AND SHORTLY AFTER WAS USHERED INTO THE APARTMENT WHERE CEDRIC AND ATHELSTANE WERE CONFINED
WHERE'S COBWEB READY SAID COBWEB
SO THE FOUR MORTAL LOVERS WENT BACK TO ATHENS AND WERE MARRIED
AND IN SPITE OF MY GUARDS I BELIEVE THERE COULD NOT BE FEWER THAN TEN THOUSAND AT SEVERAL TIMES WHO MOUNTED MY BODY BY THE HELP OF LADDERS
THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS FOREMOST RAN IN UPON HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN
HE WOULD THRUST HIM LIKE A CUR OVER HIS THRESHOLD AND WOULD EVEN SPIT ON HIM
FARE THEE WELL JEWESS!--THOU HAST TO DO WITH THEM THAT HAVE NEITHER SCRUPLE NOR PITY AND SO SAYING SHE LEFT THE ROOM LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HER
HASTEN TO LEAD YOUR FORCES TO THE ATTACK AND WHEN THOU SHALT SEE A RED FLAG WAVE FROM THE EASTERN TURRET PRESS THE NORMANS HARD
AT THE TIME THAT OUR STORY COMMENCES ONE GODFREY BERTRAM WAS THE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN AND THE OWNER OF THE NOW DIMINISHED ESTATES
THEN HOLDING A COUNCIL AND DELIBERATING UPON THIS OCCURRENCE THEY GUESSED THAT CASSIM WHEN HE WAS IN COULD NOT GET OUT AGAIN BUT COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW HE HAD LEARNED THE SECRET WORDS BY WHICH ALONE HE COULD ENTER
ROBBER AND VILLAIN HE EXCLAIMED I WILL PAY THEE NOTHING--NOT ONE SILVER PENNY WILL I PAY THEE--UNLESS MY DAUGHTER IS DELIVERED TO ME IN SAFETY AND HONOUR
HE'LL BE A LUCKY LAD AN HE WIN THROUGH WI'T FOOTNOTE
THE EMPEROR OF BLEFUSCU HAVING TAKEN THREE DAYS TO CONSULT RETURNED AN ANSWER CONSISTING OF MANY CIVILITIES AND EXCUSES
ALADDIN KNOWING THAT THIS WOULD BE SO HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS COMMANDS TO THE GENIE OF THE LAMP
I WAITED A LONG TIME
AT WHICH THEY WERE NOT A LITTLE SORRY YET THEY DURST NOT GO OUT OF THE WAY
NOW AS THE WAVES WERE NOT SO HIGH AS AT FIRST BEING NEARER LAND I HELD MY HOLD TILL THE WAVE ABATED AND THEN FETCHED ANOTHER RUN WHICH BROUGHT ME SO NEAR THE SHORE THAT THE NEXT WAVE THOUGH IT WENT OVER ME YET DID NOT SO SWALLOW ME UP AS TO CARRY ME AWAY
MR BERTRAM HAD BEEN SOME DISTANCE FROM HOME ON THE DAY OF THE EVICTION
NOW THE MAN TO LOOK ON SEEMED VERY SAD
OUT OF GRATITUDE TO GOD FOR HIS MERCIES I CONTRIBUTED LIBERALLY TOWARD THE SUPPORT OF SEVERAL MOSQUES AND THE SUBSISTENCE OF THE POOR AND ENJOYED MYSELF WITH FRIENDS IN FESTIVITIES AND AMUSEMENTS
ON THE ONE SIDE HE HAD TO A GREAT DEGREE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND MEN AND WOMEN AND READ THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
HE WAS A COMELY HANDSOME FELLOW PERFECTLY WELL MADE WITH STRAIGHT STRONG LIMBS NOT TOO LARGE
THERE YOU SHALL NOT SEE AGAIN SUCH THINGS AS YOU SAW WHEN YOU WERE IN THE LOWER REGION UPON THE EARTH TO WIT SORROW SICKNESS AFFLICTION AND HEALTH FOR THE FORMER THINGS ARE PASSED AWAY
PUCK WENT BACK AND TOLD OBERON WHAT HE HAD DONE AND OBERON SOON FOUND THAT HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND SET ABOUT LOOKING FOR DEMETRIUS AND HAVING FOUND HIM PUT SOME OF THE JUICE ON HIS EYES
SUPPER WAS GOT READY A GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE WAS OPENED AND THE LAIRD AND THE DOMINIC AND GUY MANNERING WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES COMFORTABLY WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE SHRILL VOICE OF SOMEONE COMING UPSTAIRS
HE WAS WEARING THE ROUGH SUIT IN WHICH HE HAD SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE GIPSY'S HOUSE HAVING BEEN UNABLE TO PROCURE A CHANGE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PORTMANTEAU HAVING BEEN STOLEN
FOR BY THE HEAD OF MY FATHER THOU HAST NO OTHER OPTION SO MAY ABRAHAM JACOB AND ALL THE FATHERS OF OUR PEOPLE ASSIST ME SAID ISAAC
THUS WAS I EXPOSED TO THE MERCY OF THE WAVES THE REST OF THAT DAY AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
BUT ADDED HE MY SON WHAT IS PAST CANNOT BE RECALLED
FOR GOD'S SAKE TOM SMITH THROW DOWN YOUR ARMS AND YIELD OR YOU ARE ALL DEAD MEN THIS MOMENT WHO MUST WE YIELD TO
SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD INTENTIONS
BUT I HAD A STRANGE UNEASINESS IN MY MIND TO GO DOWN TO THE POINT OF THE ISLAND
SO THEY CONSENTED TO ERECT THERE A PILLAR AND TO ENGRAVE UPON THE SIDE THEREOF THIS SENTENCE OVER THIS STILE IS THE WAY TO DOUBTING CASTLE WHICH IS KEPT BY GIANT DESPAIR WHO DESPISETH THE KING OF THE COELESTIAL COUNTRY AND SEEKS TO DESTROY HIS HOLY PILGRIMS MANY THEREFORE THAT FOLLOWED AFTER READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND ESCAPED THE DANGER
I ANSWERED I WAS AN ENGLISHMAN DRAWN BY ILL FORTUNE INTO THE GREATEST CALAMITY THAT EVER ANY CREATURE UNDERWENT AND BEGGED BY ALL THAT WAS MOVING TO BE DELIVERED OUT OF THE DUNGEON I WAS IN
THAT SHE SHOULD ACCEPT HIM AS A LOVER
I GAVE THE TENTH OF MY GAINS IN ALMS AS I HAD DONE UPON MY RETURN FROM MY OTHER VOYAGES AND RESTED FROM MY FATIGUES
I ACCEPT THE OFFER SAID THE KNIGHT
ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF GLOSSIN DIRCK HATTERAICK WAS HIMSELF FOUND DEAD IN THE CELL HAVING HANGED HIMSELF BY MEANS OF A CORD TAKEN FROM HIS BED WHICH HE HAD CUNNINGLY CONTRIVED TO ATTACH TO THE PRISON WALL
AND HAVING SERVED FOR A LONG TIME IN INDIA WAS APPOINTED COLONEL OF HIS REGIMENT
THIS IS A MATTER OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE AND FOR FEAR OF ANY TREACHERY I PROPOSE THAT WHOEVER UNDERTAKES THIS BUSINESS WITHOUT SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH THE FAILURE ARISES ONLY FROM AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT SHALL SUFFER DEATH WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE SENTIMENTS OF HIS COMPANIONS ONE OF THE ROBBERS STARTED UP AND SAID I SUBMIT TO THIS CONDITION AND THINK IT AN HONOR TO EXPOSE MY LIFE TO SERVE THE TROOP AFTER THIS ROBBER HAD RECEIVED GREAT COMMENDATIONS FROM THE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMRADES HE DISGUISED HIMSELF SO THAT NOBODY WOULD TAKE HIM FOR WHAT HE WAS
THOSE TWO I GOT TO MY RAFT WITH THE ARMS
MY SOUL CHUSETH STRANGLING RATHER THAN LIFE AND THE GRAVE IS MORE EASY FOR ME THAN THIS DUNGEON
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I COULD NOT HAVE HAD THE LEAST REFLECTION UPON MY MIND OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES WHILE I WAS MAKING THIS BOAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT HOW I SHOULD GET IT INTO THE SEA
I HALLOOED AGAIN TO HIM AND MADE SIGNS TO COME FORWARD WHICH HE EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND CAME A LITTLE WAY
AND THE PRINCESS EXPRESSING HER WISHES HE IMMEDIATELY SENT FOUR SLAVES FOR THE PRETENDED HOLY WOMAN
FIVE HUNDRED WORKMEN WERE EMPLOYED TO MAKE TWO SAILS TO MY BOAT ACCORDING TO MY DIRECTIONS BY QUILTING THIRTEEN FOLDS OF THEIR STRONGEST LINEN TOGETHER
CASSIM'S WIFE STAYED AT HOME MOURNING UTTERING LAMENTABLE CRIES WITH THE WOMEN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO CAME ACCORDING TO CUSTOM DURING THE FUNERAL AND JOINING THEIR LAMENTATIONS WITH HERS FILLED THE QUARTER FAR AND NEAR WITH SOUNDS OF SORROW
MEANWHILE THE TILTYARD OF THE PRECEPTORY OF TEMPLESTOWE WAS PREPARED FOR THE COMBAT WHICH SHOULD DECIDE THE LIFE OR DEATH OF REBECCA
LIKE ALL GREAT BOOKS IT INTERESTS PEOPLE OF ALL AGES
AND TOOK ME BEFORE THE CAPTAIN WHO SEEING THAT I WAS IN RAGS GAVE ME ONE OF HIS OWN SUITS
IF I MAKE A RAFT AND LEAVE MYSELF TO THE CURRENT IT WILL CONVEY ME TO SOME INHABITED COUNTRY OR I SHALL PERISH
THE CAPTAIN WAS TERRIBLY AMAZED AND EVEN CONFOUNDED AT THIS BELIEVING THEY WOULD GO ON BOARD THE SHIP AGAIN AND SET SAIL GIVING THEIR COMRADES OVER FOR LOST AND SO HE SHOULD STILL LOSE THE SHIP WHICH HE WAS IN HOPES WE SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED
MANY TRICKS DID ARIEL PLAY THEM
BY GOOD FORTUNE HE HAD BEEN SO WELL TAUGHT THAT I WAS CARRIED BETWEEN HIS TEETH WITHOUT THE LEAST HURT OR EVEN TEARING MY CLOTHES
HERE I FOUND THE SUN VERY POWERFUL AND I WAS SO MUCH FATIGUED THAT I STEPPED INTO ONE OF THE CANNON TO COMPOSE ME WHERE I FELL FAST ASLEEP
BUT WAMBA SPRINGING FORWARD IN GOOD TIME CHECKED THE FATAL CAREER OF THE BLUE KNIGHT BY HAMSTRINGING HIS HORSE WITH A STROKE OF HIS SWORD
ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AMONG THE SHRUBS AND PERCEIVING THE DOOR CONCEALED BEHIND THEM STOOD BEFORE IT AND SAID OPEN SESAME THE DOOR INSTANTLY FLEW WIDE OPEN
THERE ALSO SHALL YOU BE CLOATHED WITH GLORY AND MAJESTY AND PUT INTO AN EQUIPAGE FIT TO RIDE OUT WITH THE KING OF GLORY
ON THE NEWS OF HAZLEWOOD'S BEING WOUNDED GETTING ABROAD THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS THROWN INTO A FERMENT OF INDIGNATION
MY NEXT CARE WAS WHAT TO LOAD IT WITH AND HOW TO PRESERVE WHAT I LAID UPON IT FROM THE SURF OF THE SEA
FOR I SAW MY DELIVERANCE INDEED VISIBLY PUT INTO MY HANDS ALL THINGS EASY AND A LARGE SHIP JUST READY TO CARRY ME AWAY WHITHER I PLEASED TO GO
I GOT IN AND THE BOY SHUT THE WINDOW CLOSE DOWN TO KEEP OUT THE COLD
AND INDEED IT WAS A PRESENT AS IF I HAD BEEN ONE THAT WAS NOT TO BE CARRIED AWAY WITH THEM BUT AS IF I HAD BEEN TO DWELL UPON THE ISLAND STILL
BUT I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO RIP UP HIS BELLY BEFORE HE COULD DO ME ANY MISCHIEF
ROBINSON CRUSOE ALTHOUGH HUNDREDS HAVE TRIED BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO WRITE A BOOK THAT COULD TAKE THE PLACE OF ROBINSON CRUSOE THE STORY OF THAT STURDY VOYAGING ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ADVENTURES AND WAS NEVER DISCOURAGED BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF
AN INTERVAL OF QUIET NOW SUCCEEDED THE BESIEGERS REMAINING IN POSSESSION OF THE OUTER DEFENCES OF THE CASTLE AND THE BESIEGED RETIRING FOR THE TIME WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE FORTRESS
THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE THE GREATEST OF ENGLISH WRITERS WAS BORN IN 1564 AND WAS PRETTY WELL EDUCATED FOR THOSE DAYS
I HAD IN VAIN ENTREATED THEM NOT TO MEDDLE WITH THE EGG
SINDBAD STOPPED HERE AND ORDERED THE MUSICIANS TO PROCEED WITH THEIR CONCERT WHICH THE STORY HAD INTERRUPTED
THEY HAVE JUST BEEN CELEBRATING IN FRANCE THE CENTENARY OF JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU
THE REST OF THE GREAT OFFICERS ARE MUCH UPON A PAR
MAKING A THOUSAND GESTURES AND MOTIONS WHICH I CANNOT DESCRIBE
I HAD NOW MADE A GOOD PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING AND SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE
THE PRINCESS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE SUCCESS OF HER SCHEME HAD SO PLACED HER WOMEN FROM THE GREAT HALL TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE THAT THE WORD WAS NO SOONER GIVEN THAT THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WAS FALLEN BACKWARD THAN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ALADDIN ADMITTED TO THE HALL
ROBINSON CRUSOE WAS WRITTEN IN 1719 BY DANIEL DEFOE THE SON OF A BUTCHER WHEN HE WAS OVER SIXTY YEARS OF AGE
WE SAW BEFORE US A LARGE APARTMENT WITH A PORCH HAVING ON ONE SIDE A HEAP OF HUMAN BONES AND ON THE OTHER A VAST NUMBER OF ROASTING-SPITS
AND SO IT HAS COME TO BE READ AGAIN AND AGAIN AND ADMIRED AND CHERISHED THE WORLD OVER
THE LARGENESS OF ITS FEATURES MADE IT APPEAR THE MOST DEFORMED ANIMAL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED
I HAD A GREAT HIGH SHAPELESS CAP MADE OF A GOAT'S SKIN WITH A FLAP HANGING DOWN BEHIND AS WELL TO KEEP THE SUN FROM ME AS TO SHOOT THE RAIN OFF FROM RUNNING INTO MY NECK NOTHING BEING SO HURTFUL IN THESE CLIMATES AS THE RAIN UPON THE FLESH UNDER THE CLOTHES
IF THE GRAVE CAN GIVE UP THE DEAD THAT IS MY DEAR AND HONOURED MASTER A LAWYER FRIEND OF THE COLONEL'S A MR PLEYDALL WAS STAYING AT WOODBOURNE THAT NIGHT AND HE AT ONCE SET ABOUT ENDEAVOURING TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY
I WAS ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME GAP IN THE HEDGE WHEN I DISCOVERED ONE OF THE INHABITANTS IN THE NEXT FIELD ADVANCING TOWARD THE STILE OF THE SAME SIZE WITH HIM WHOM I SAW IN THE SEA PURSUING OUR BOAT
AND WHEN I THOUGHT FIT I TORE THEM IN PIECES AND SO WITHIN TEN DAYS I WILL DO YOU
ALONE ON A DESOLATE ISLAND BY DANIEL DEFOE WHEN I WAKED IT WAS BROAD DAY THE WEATHER CLEAR AND THE STORM ABATED SO THAT THE SEA DID NOT RAGE AND SWELL AS BEFORE
WHEN DAY APPEARED HE RETIRED BUT I DARED NOT LEAVE MY FORT UNTIL THE SUN AROSE
IN SPITE OF THIS OMINOUS INTELLIGENCE ISAAC PURSUED HIS WAY AND ON ARRIVING AT TEMPLESTOWE WAS AT ONCE SHOWN INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE GRAND MASTER HIMSELF
HE WHOSE PRISONER THOU ART SCORNS TO TAKE MEAN REVENGE FOR WHAT IS PAST
TO YOU ANTONIO HE SAID I OWE THE MOST IN MONEY AND IN LOVE
OUR MEN THEREFORE WANDERED ON THE SHORE TO FIND OUT SOME FRESH WATER NEAR THE SEA AND I WALKED ALONE ABOUT A MILE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE I OBSERVED THE COUNTRY ALL BARREN AND ROCKY
WHEN HE FOUND THAT HIS ATTEMPT HAD FAILED HE SET OUT TO RETURN TO AFRICA BUT AVOIDED THE TOWN LEST ANY PERSON WHO HAD SEEN HIM LEAVE IN COMPANY WITH ALADDIN SHOULD MAKE INQUIRIES AFTER THE YOUTH
AND BEFORE LONG THE GRAND MASTER PRECEDED BY A STATELY RETINUE APPROACHED HIS THRONE
THERE TITANIA ALWAYS SLEPT A PART OF THE NIGHT WRAPPED IN THE ENAMELED SKIN OF A SNAKE
HE ANSWERED SIR I PERCEIVE BY THE BOOK IN MY HAND THAT I AM CONDEMNED TO DIE AND AFTER THAT TO COME TO JUDGMENT AND I FIND THAT I AM NOT WILLING TO DO THE FIRST NOR ABLE TO DO THE SECOND
THUS MY FEAR BANISHED ALL MY RELIGIOUS HOPE ALL THAT FORMER CONFIDENCE IN GOD WHICH WAS FOUNDED UPON SUCH WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE AS I HAD HAD OF HIS GOODNESS
I HAVE TWO BOONS TO CRAVE ANSWERED THE GIPSY SPEAKING LOW AND HASTILY
AND NOW ABEL SAMPSON AS EVER YE LOVED THE HOUSE OF ELLANGOWAN AWAY WITH MY MESSAGE TO THE ENGLISH COLONEL AS IF LIFE AND DEATH WERE UPON YOUR HASTE SO SAYING SHE TURNED SUDDENLY FROM THE AMAZED DOMINIE WHO HURRIED BACK TO WOODBOURNE EXCLAIMING AS HE WENT PRODIGIOUS
MANNERING WAS MUCH AFFECTED WHEN THE OLD LAIRD FAILED TO REMEMBER HIM FOR HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS HOSPITABLE KINDNESS MANY YEARS BEFORE ON THE NIGHT WHEN LITTLE HARRY WAS BORN
IN THE MEANTIME THE ROBBER REJOINED HIS TROOP IN THE FOREST AND RECOUNTED TO THEM HIS SUCCESS EXPATIATING UPON HIS GOOD FORTUNE IN MEETING SO SOON WITH THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD INFORM HIM OF WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW
THE GRAND VIZIER WHO IN SECRET BORE NO GOODWILL TO ALADDIN INTIMATED HIS SUSPICION THAT THE PALACE WAS BUILT BY MAGIC AND THAT ALADDIN HAD MADE HIS HUNTING EXCURSION AN EXCUSE FOR THE REMOVAL OF HIS PALACE WITH THE SAME SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN ERECTED
HE WAS SOON MUFFLED IN HIS RELIGIOUS DISGUISE
AND INDEED IT ALMOST SPOILED SOME OF THEM AND ALMOST DRIED UP THEIR MILK
ALTHOUGH MY EVIL DESTINY SO ORDERED THAT SHE HAD NOT POWER TO HINDER ME AS THE READER MAY KNOW HEREAFTER
THEN HER FEAR REDOUBLED AND HER GRIEF WAS THE MORE SENSIBLE BECAUSE SHE WAS FORCED TO KEEP IT TO HERSELF
THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE SOON LOST UNDER THE BOUGHS OF THE FOREST PATH
NOW WHEN THEY WERE COME UP TO THE GATE THERE WAS WRITTEN OVER IT IN LETTERS OF GOLD BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
WHEN ALADDIN HAD GOT INTO HIS CHAMBER HE TOOK THE LAMP RUBBED IT IN THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE WHEN IMMEDIATELY THE GENIE APPEARED AND SAID TO HIM WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE
HE KNEW THAT IVANHOE HAD BEEN A CLOSE ATTENDANT ON HIS BROTHER KING RICHARD IN THE HOLY LAND
I HAD ONLY ONE MISFORTUNE THAT THE RATS ON BOARD CARRIED AWAY ONE OF MY SHEEP
WE OBSERVED ALSO AN AMPHIBIOUS ANIMAL LIKE A COW WHICH GAVE MILK
BY THIS YOU MAY SEE WE ARE RIGHT
AND WITH THAT HIS WIFE REPLIED I FEAR SAID SHE THAT THEY LIVE IN HOPE THAT SOME WILL COME TO RELIEVE THEM OR THAT THEY HAVE PICK-LOCKS ABOUT THEM BY THE MEANS OF WHICH THEY HOPE TO ESCAPE
THE TREMBLING OF THE ISLAND WAS NOTICED ON BOARD SHIP AND WE WERE CALLED UPON TO RE-EMBARK SPEEDILY LEST WE SHOULD ALL BE LOST
ALADDIN THEN ADDRESSED HIS MOTHER
IT WAS NOW ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND THE CAPTAIN ORDERED SUPPER IMMEDIATELY THINKING I HAD ALREADY FASTED TOO LONG
BUT TOLD THE CAPTAIN I WOULD STAY THAT NIGHT TO PREPARE MY THINGS AND DESIRED HIM TO GO ON BOARD IN THE MEANTIME AND KEEP ALL RIGHT IN THE SHIP AND SEND THE BOAT ON SHORE NEXT DAY FOR ME
BUT HE WAS AT LAST IN PAIN AT MY LONG ABSENCE
AFTER WHICH THEY PROVED VERY HONEST AND QUIET FELLOWS
HINDBAD WHOSE FEAR WAS INCREASED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MANY PEOPLE AND OF A BANQUET SO SUMPTUOUS SALUTED THE COMPANY TREMBLING
BUT I WILL TELL YOU NOW WHAT IT WANTS AND THAT IS A ROC'S EGG HUNG UP IN THE MIDST OF THE DOME PRINCESS REPLIED ALADDIN IT IS ENOUGH THAT YOU THINK IT WANTS SUCH AN ORNAMENT
AND THEN WENT TO MORGIANA TO BID HER TO GET A GOOD SUPPER FOR HIS GUEST
AND HAVING REFRESHED HIM I MADE SIGNS FOR HIM TO GO AND LIE DOWN TO SLEEP SHOWING HIM A PLACE WHERE I HAD LAID SOME RICE-STRAW AND A BLANKET UPON IT WHICH I USED TO SLEEP UPON MYSELF SOMETIMES
AND THEREFORE SOMETIMES I SAT CONTRIVING WAYS TO GET HER ABOUT THE ISLAND AND AT OTHER TIMES I SAT MYSELF DOWN CONTENTED ENOUGH WITHOUT HER
BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE SHIP MY DIFFICULTY WAS STILL GREATER TO KNOW HOW TO GET ON BOARD
ALL HER ORNAMENTS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND A COARSE WHITE DRESS OF THE SIMPLEST FORM HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR HER ORIENTAL GARMENTS
I WAS POSITIVELY AGAINST THAT
AND TERRIBLY APPREHENSIVE HE WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE TOO POWERFUL FOR US
ALADDIN IGNORANT OF THEIR VALUE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED FIGS OR GRAPES OR POMEGRANATES
THEY WERE INTERRUPTED IN THEIR CONVERSATION BY MAC-GUFFOG WHO TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THE VISITOR TO LEAVE
AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD PASSED BY AND ENTERED THE BATH ALADDIN QUITTED HIS HIDING-PLACE AND WENT HOME
THE UNHAPPY JEW EYED THEIR SAVAGE COUNTENANCES AND THAT OF FRONT DE-BOEUF IN HOPE OF DISCOVERING SOME SYMPTOMS OF RELENTING
AND WHEN I WAS DOWN THE HAILSTONES GAVE ME SUCH CRUEL BANGS ALL OVER THE BODY AS IF I HAD BEEN PELTED WITH TENNIS-BALLS
AND HAD IT RETURNED AGAIN IMMEDIATELY I MUST HAVE BEEN STRANGLED IN THE WATER
I SMILED AT HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT MEN IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES WERE PAST THE OPERATION OF FEAR
THEY PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO BEAR THEIR CONFINEMENT WITH PATIENCE AND WERE VERY THANKFUL THAT THEY HAD SUCH GOOD USAGE AS TO HAVE PROVISIONS AND LIGHT LEFT THEM
AND FINDING THE WATER HAD SPENT ITSELF AND BEGAN TO RETURN I STRUCK FORWARD AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE WAVES AND FELT GROUND AGAIN WITH MY FEET
AND HAD I GOTTEN IT INTO THE WATER I MAKE NO QUESTION BUT I SHOULD HAVE BEGUN THE MADDEST VOYAGE AND THE MOST UNLIKELY TO BE PERFORMED THAT EVER WAS UNDERTAKEN
THE CHAIN ENABLED HIM TO MOVE A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE BAR AND WHEN THUS SECURED HIS HANDCUFFS WERE REMOVED
THE FOOT BY TWENTY-FOUR IN A-BREAST AND THE HORSE BY SIXTEEN WITH DRUMS BEATING COLORS FLYING AND PIKES ADVANCED
GABRIEL THE GIPSY THE SAME MAN WHO HAD AVOIDED MEETING BERTRAM'S EYE WHEN OUT HUNTING WITH DANDIE DINMONT TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF KENNEDY'S MURDER AS HE WAS AT WARROCH POINT ON THE DAY OF ITS OCCURRENCE
YOU MAY BE SURE MY THOUGHTS RAN MANY TIMES UPON THE PROSPECT OF LAND WHICH I HAD SEEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND
THOSE PIECES OF GLASS WHICH I GOT FROM THE TREES IN THE GARDEN OF THE SUBTERRANEAN PALACE ARE JEWELS OF INESTIMABLE VALUE AND FIT FOR THE GREATEST MONARCHS
NOTWITHSTANDING THE TWILIGHT AND ALTHOUGH HIS DRESS AND ARMS SHOWED HIM TO BE AN OUTLAW WAMBA RECOGNISED HIM TO BE LOCKSLEY THE YEOMAN A MAN WHO HAD CARRIED OFF THE PRIZE FOR ARCHERY AT THE TOURNAMENT A DAY OR TWO BEFORE
I OFFERED TO LEAVE MY GOODS IN SECURITY FOR PAYMENT OF MY FREIGHT BUT THE CAPTAIN PROTESTED HE WOULD NOT RECEIVE ONE FARTHING
BUT WHEN HE HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD AND THE DOOR HAD OPENED HE WAS STRUCK WITH HORROR AT THE DISMAL SIGHT OF HIS BROTHER'S BODY
THIS INFAMOUS MAGICIAN THE BASEST OF MEN WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF MY MISFORTUNE THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WHO WAS THUS TWICE FOILED IN HIS ENDEAVOR TO RUIN ALADDIN HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER WHO WAS AS SKILFUL A MAGICIAN AS HIMSELF AND EXCEEDED HIM IN WICKEDNESS AND HATRED OF MANKIND
UPON THIS MY SAVAGE FOR SO I CALL HIM NOW MADE A MOTION TO ME TO LEND HIM MY SWORD WHICH HUNG NAKED IN A BELT BY MY SIDE WHICH I DID
THIS WAS ABOUT NOON
ALL EYES WERE TURNED TO SEE THE NEW CHAMPION AND NO SOONER WERE THE BARRIERS OPENED THAN HE PACED INTO THE LISTS
THE DARK RED FLUSH WAS STILL ON HIS BROW
THE INHABITANTS ARE SO BARBAROUS THAT THEY STILL EAT HUMAN FLESH
IT WILL NOT BE SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF
I BELIEVE YOU SON TO BE SO DUTIFUL A CHILD THAT YOU WILL NOT REFUSE MORGIANA FOR YOUR WIFE
BUT HOPED IF HE NOW MISSED HIS AIM TO SECURE IT ANOTHER TIME BY KEEPING UP A FRIENDLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FATHER AND SON
SUCH IS THE LAW AND SHYLOCK IN HIS FEAR SAID THEN I WILL TAKE BASSANIO'S OFFER NO SAID PORTIA STERNLY YOU SHALL HAVE NOTHING BUT YOUR BOND
6TH
SOMETIMES I FANCIED IT MUST BE THE DEVIL AND REASON JOINED IN WITH ME IN THIS SUPPOSITION FOR HOW SHOULD ANY OTHER THING IN HUMAN SHAPE COME INTO THE PLACE
BUT HE BEING A MAN WELL EXPERIENCED IN THE NAVIGATION OF THOSE SEAS BID US ALL PREPARE AGAINST A STORM WHICH ACCORDINGLY HAPPENED ON THE DAY FOLLOWING
I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP I AM HUNGRY SAID ALADDIN
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE TAKEN INTO MY SERVICE UPON THE CAPTAIN'S RECOMMENDATION AND UPON THEIR SOLEMNLY ENGAGING TO LIVE AND DIE WITH US
HE THEN EMPTIED THE BAGS WHICH RAISED SUCH A GREAT HEAP OF GOLD AS DAZZLED HIS WIFE'S EYES AND THEN HE TOLD HER THE WHOLE ADVENTURE FROM BEGINNING TO END AND ABOVE ALL RECOMMENDED HER TO KEEP IT SECRET
I REMOVED FROM THE OLD JEWRY TO FETTER LANE AND FROM THENCE TO WAPPING HOPING TO GET BUSINESS AMONG THE SAILORS
SO THAT HAD MY CAVE BEEN TO BE SEEN IT LOOKED LIKE A GENERAL MAGAZINE OF ALL NECESSARY THINGS
THESE OBJECTS SERVED ONLY TO AUGMENT OUR DESPAIR
NO ONE WHO BEGINS TO READ GUY MANNERING WILL WISH TO PUT IT DOWN UNTIL HE HAS FINISHED IT IVANHOE RETOLD BY SIR EDWARD SULLIVAN AT THE TIME WHEN KING RICHARD OF THE LION HEART WAS ABSENT FROM HIS COUNTRY AND A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF THE PERFIDIOUS AND CRUEL DUKE OF AUSTRIA THERE LIVED IN ENGLAND A HIGHBORN SAXON NAMED CEDRIC
I APPROACHED HIS THRONE AND SALUTED HIM AS I USED TO DO THE KINGS OF THE INDIES
NESBIT ANTONIO WAS A RICH AND PROSPEROUS MERCHANT OF VENICE
MAY I GET OUT AGAIN WITH MY LIFE YOU SHALL POSSESS THE COUNTRY ALONE
KILL ME SAID THE CLOWN THE RED BUMBLE-BEE ON THE TOP OF THE THISTLE YONDER AND BRING ME THE HONEY-BAG
AND IN A WORD THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER I WOULD GO TO MANAGE THE TRADING PART UPON THE COAST OF GUINEA
BUT ALL MY DEVICES TO GET IT INTO THE WATER FAILED ME
AND MIRANDA IN TERROR PRAYED HER FATHER TO HAVE MERCY ON HER LOVER
I WAS CARRIED AS USUAL IN MY TRAVELLING BOX WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WAS A VERY CONVENIENT CLOSET OF TWELVE FEET WIDE
WHILE THE FIFTH KNIGHT ALONE MAINTAINED THE HONOUR OF HIS PARTY
AS HE FANCIED THAT THIS WOMAN MIGHT BE SERVICEABLE TO HIM IN THE PROJECT HE HAD CONCEIVED HE MADE MORE MINUTE INQUIRIES AND REQUESTED TO BE INFORMED MORE PARTICULARLY WHO THAT HOLY WOMAN WAS AND WHAT SORT OF MIRACLES SHE PERFORMED
AND PARTICULARLY THE FEATURES OF MY MASTER'S COUNTENANCE ALTHOUGH HE WERE BUT A FARMER WHEN I BEHELD HIM FROM THE HEIGHT OF SIXTY FEET APPEARED VERY WELL PROPORTIONED
BUT HE STILL LIVED WITH THE LAIRD AS BEFORE AND WAS CHIEFLY EMPLOYED IN TEACHING BERTRAM'S DAUGHTER LITTLE LUCY WHO WAS NOW GROWING UP INTO A GENTLE AND BONNY GIRL
THE WAVE THAT CAME UPON ME AGAIN BURIED ME AT ONCE TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET DEEP IN ITS OWN BODY AND I COULD FEEL MYSELF CARRIED WITH A MIGHTY FORCE AND SWIFTNESS TOWARD THE SHORE A VERY GREAT WAY
IT WAS ALREADY GROWING DARK WHEN A SHRILL AND PIERCING SHOUT WAS HEARD FROM THE SEA SHORE UNDER THE WOOD AND ON HURRYING TO THE PLACE MR BERTRAM WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE THE DEAD BODY OF FRANK KENNEDY LYING ON THE BEACH RIGHT UNDER A HIGH PRECIPICE OF ROCKS
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER A BAND OF YEOMEN HEADED BY LOCKSLEY BROKE FORTH FROM THE GLADE WHO JOINING MANFULLY IN THE FRAY SOON DISPOSED OF THE RUFFIANS ALL OF WHOM LAY ON THE SPOT DEAD OR MORTALLY WOUNDED
I GOT IT DOWN TO MY RAFT WHOLE AS IT WAS WITHOUT LOSING TIME TO LOOK INTO IT FOR I KNEW IN GENERAL WHAT IT CONTAINED
SO THEY CALLED TO KNOW THE MATTER BUT THERE WAS NONE TO ANSWER ONLY THEY HEARD A GROANING
BUT IT WENT AGAINST MY STOMACH TO DRAW THE CARCASS OFF THE BED WHERE IT LAY STILL BLEEDING
ONE DAY ORLANDO MET THEM BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ROSALIND IN HER BOY'S CLOTHES THOUGH HE LIKED THE PRETTY SHEPHERD YOUTH BECAUSE HE FANCIED A LIKENESS IN HIM TO HER HE LOVED
PERHAPS THE SULTAN MAY NOT BE SO BUSY THE NEXT MORNING SHE REPAIRED TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE WITH THE PRESENT AS EARLY AS THE DAY BEFORE
MY PATRON DESIGNING TO RETURN WHEN IT WAS ROTTEN AND TAKE HIS TEETH TO TRADE WITH
MY DEAR FRIEND AND DELIVERER SAYS HE THERE'S YOUR SHIP
SO I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT THE MAN BEGAN TO RUN
AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING DURING WHICH THE PRINCESS HAD TRIED ALL SHE COULD TO PLEASE HIM SHE ASKED HIM TO EXCHANGE CUPS WITH HER AND GIVING THE SIGNAL HAD THE DRUGGED CUP BROUGHT TO HER WHICH SHE GAVE TO THE MAGICIAN
FOR BY LIFTING IT UP TO MY FACE I DISCOVERED THE METHODS THEY HAD TAKEN TO BIND ME AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH A VIOLENT PULL WHICH GAVE ME EXCESSIVE PAIN I A LITTLE LOOSENED THE STRINGS THAT TIED DOWN MY HAIR ON THE LEFT SIDE SO THAT I WAS JUST ABLE TO TURN MY HEAD ABOUT TWO INCHES
WHEN ALI BABA HEARD HIM MAKE THE DOOR CLOSE BY PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS SHUT SESAME EVERY MAN AT ONCE WENT AND BRIDLED HIS HORSE FASTENED HIS WALLET AND MOUNTED AGAIN
IN THE VERSION HERE GIVEN THE STORY HAS BEEN CONDENSED BY OMITTING THE LESS DRAMATIC PASSAGES BUT THE AUTHOR'S TEXT REMAINS OTHERWISE UNCHANGED CHRISTIAN STARTS ON HIS JOURNEY BY JOHN BUNYAN AS I WALK'D THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF THIS WORLD I LIGHTED ON A CERTAIN PLACE WHERE WAS A DEN AND I LAID ME DOWN IN THAT PLACE TO SLEEP
AFTERWARD THE PRINCESS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK AGAIN INTO THE GREAT HALL TO MAKE HIM DINE WITH HER
THE EMPEROR AND HIS WHOLE COURT STOOD ON THE SHORE EXPECTING THE ISSUE OF THIS GREAT ADVENTURE
THAT SUCH THINGS AS THESE WERE THE TESTIMONIES WE HAD OF A SECRET HAND OF PROVIDENCE GOVERNING THE WORLD AND AN EVIDENCE THAT THE EYE OF AN INFINITE POWER COULD SEARCH INTO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE WORLD AND SEND HELP TO THE MISERABLE WHENEVER HE PLEASED
BUT THE SAIL WAS SPLIT AND WE HAULED DOWN THE YARD AND GOT THE SAIL INTO THE SHIP AND UNBOUND ALL THE THINGS CLEAR OF IT
HE HAD COME HE SAID TO TELL HER THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO REFUSE TO DO BATTLE FOR THE TEMPLARS AGAINST HER AND SACRIFICE HIS NAME AND HONOUR AS A MEMBER OF THE HOLY ORDER AND THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE PRECEPTORY APPEAR IN THREE DAYS IN DISGUISE AND HIMSELF BE HER CHAMPION AGAINST ANY KNIGHT WHO SHOULD CONFRONT HIM ON ONE CONDITION
NO
AS THE BANQUET WENT ON CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF A PAGE WHO ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WAS A STRANGER AT THE GATE IMPLORING ADMITTANCE AND HOSPITALITY
HE TOOK IT IN HIS HAND LOOKED FOR THAT PART WHERE HIS MOTHER HAD RUBBED IT WITH THE SAND RUBBED IT ALSO WHEN THE GENIE IMMEDIATELY APPEARED AND SAID WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE
AND THAT I SHALL LOSE MY GOOD MASTER ON THE OTHER HAND AS ALI BABA AND HIS WIFE WERE OFTEN SEEN TO GO BETWEEN CASSIM'S AND THEIR OWN HOUSE ALL THAT DAY AND TO SEEM MELANCHOLY NOBODY WAS SURPRISED IN THE EVENING TO HEAR THE LAMENTABLE SHRIEKS AND CRIES OF CASSIM'S WIFE AND MORGIANA WHO GAVE OUT EVERYWHERE THAT HER MASTER WAS DEAD
BE COMFORTED MY BROTHER FOR I FORGIVE THEE
AND THEREFORE WHEN HE WAS AGAIN ABOUT TO MOVE I SCREAMED AS LOUD AS FEAR COULD MAKE ME
WHEREUPON HE BEGAN AGAIN TO THINK THAT MY BRAIN WAS DISTURBED OF WHICH HE GAVE ME A HINT AND ADVISED ME TO GO TO BED IN A CABIN HE HAD PROVIDED
DO NOT BE AFRAID THAT THE LIQUOR WILL SPOIL YOUR CLOTHES FOR IT IS NOT OIL AND THE LAMP WILL BE DRY AS SOON AS IT IS THROWN OUT AFTER THESE WORDS THE MAGICIAN DREW A RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PUT IT ON ONE OF ALADDIN'S SAYING
HIS NAME IS APOLLYON
LET THE LAW HAVE ITS OWN--HE MUST SPEAK ERE HE DIE SHE THEN SUPPLIED THE TWO WITH LOADED PISTOLS AND STARTED AFRESH THROUGH THE WOOD IN THE DIRECTION OF WARROCH POINT
EXPLAIN YOURSELF I WILL REPLIED MORGIANA
IMMEDIATELY THE PALACE WAS TRANSPORTED INTO CHINA AND ITS REMOVAL WAS ONLY FELT BY TWO LITTLE SHOCKS THE ONE WHEN IT WAS LIFTED UP THE OTHER WHEN IT WAS SET DOWN AND BOTH IN A VERY SHORT INTERVAL OF TIME
AND IF YOU DO NOT MAKE HIM ASHAMED OF IT I DESPAIR OF HIS EVER COMING TO ANY GOOD
THEY HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM TO MIND HER
TWO OF THEM WERE KEPT PINIONED INDEED BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN WAS NOT ABLE TO TRUST THEM
AND MANY WERE THE REJOICINGS AT THE WEDDING
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THIS APPEARED
BROTHER SAID CHRISTIAN WHAT SHALL WE DO
DE BOIS-GUILBERT SEEMED TO SPEAK SLIGHTINGLY OF THE ENGLISH WARRIORS WHILE GIVING THE PLACE OF HONOUR TO THE KNIGHTS OF THE TEMPLE
ON PUTTING OUT TO SEA WE WERE OVERTAKEN BY SUCH A SUDDEN GUST OF WIND AS OBLIGED THE CAPTAIN TO LOWER HIS YARDS AND TAKE ALL OTHER NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT THE DANGER THAT THREATENED US
LET ME DIE IN PEACE IN PEACE THOU SHALT NOT DIE REPEATED THE VOICE
IT BEING TOO EXTRAORDINARY TO BE RELATED BY ANY OTHER THAN THE PERSON TO WHOM THE EVENTS HAD HAPPENED
I WILL MYSELF TELL THE NAME OF THE KNIGHT BEFORE WHOSE LANCE I FELL
WE TRADED FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND AND EXCHANGED COMMODITIES WITH GREAT PROFIT
A SENTENCE
AND WHEN THOU TALKEST OF THY JOURNEY AND OF WHAT THOU HAST HEARD AND SEEN THOU ART INWARDLY DESIROUS OF VAIN-GLORY IN ALL THAT THOU SAYEST OR DOEST
AND THE THIRD RAN FOR IT
AS HE WAS REFLECTING ON HIS MISERABLE SITUATION HIS ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE GATE OF THE GAOL
THE GOD OF ABRAHAM'S PROMISE HATH OPENED AN ESCAPE TO HIS DAUGHTER EVEN FROM THIS ABYSS OF INFAMY AS SHE SPOKE SHE THREW OPEN THE LATTICED WINDOW AND IN AN INSTANT AFTER STOOD ON THE VERY VERGE OF THE PARAPET OUTSIDE WITH NOT THE SLIGHTEST SCREEN BETWEEN HER AND THE TREMENDOUS DEPTH BELOW
OH I WANT NOTHING SAID THE CLOWN
AND I HAD THE MORTIFICATION TO SEE MY COAT SHIRT AND WAISTCOAT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE UPON THE SAND SWIM AWAY
AND WHEN THE SIGNAL FOR BATTLE WAS GIVEN SOME FIFTY KNIGHTS AT THE SAME MOMENT CHARGED WILDLY AT EACH OTHER IN THE LISTS
ALADDIN HAD FETCHED SOME WATER AND SPRINKLED IT IN HER FACE TO RECOVER HER
WHEN CLIMBING UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL THERE HE STOOD AND POINTING TO THE SHIP HE EMBRACED ME IN HIS ARMS
AND THIS I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE HE PULLED IT OUT BEFORE ME AND SHOWED IT TO ME IN TRIUMPH PRINCESS SAID ALADDIN I THINK I HAVE FOUND THE MEANS TO DELIVER YOU AND TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF THE LAMP ON WHICH ALL MY PROSPERITY DEPENDS
IN A LITTLE TIME I AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS CAME TO A RIGHT UNDERSTANDING
WHEN THEY HAD SET THEMSELVES OVER I OBSERVED THAT THE BOAT BEING GONE A GOOD WAY INTO THE CREEK AND AS IT WERE IN A HARBOR WITHIN THE LAND THEY TOOK ONE OF THE THREE MEN OUT OF HER TO GO ALONG WITH THEM AND LEFT ONLY TWO IN THE BOAT HAVING FASTENED HER TO THE STUMP OF A LITTLE TREE ON THE SHORE
FOR INDEED IT NEVER CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT I WAS NOW GOT AMONG PEOPLE OF MY OWN STATURE AND STRENGTH
ANOTHER TIME WALKING TO THE TOP OF A FRESH MOLEHILL I FELL TO MY NECK IN THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH THAT ANIMAL HAD CAST UP THE EARTH AND COINED SOME LIE NOT WORTH REMEMBERING TO EXCUSE MYSELF FOR SPOILING MY CLOTHES
I HAD ABOVE A BARREL AND A HALF OF POWDER LEFT
HIS FORBEARING AT PRESENT TO DELIVER THEM IS ON PURPOSE TO TRY THEIR LOVE WHETHER THEY WILL CLEAVE TO HIM TO THE END
AND A GREAT VIVACITY AND SPARKLING SHARPNESS IN HIS EYES
AND WHO KNOWS BUT THAT EVEN THIS PRODIGIOUS RACE OF MORTALS MIGHT BE EQUALLY OVERMATCHED IN SOME DISTANT PART OF THE WORLD WHEREOF WE HAVE YET NO DISCOVERY
UNDER THIS ASSUMED CHARACTER HE GRADUALLY CONVEYED A GREAT MANY SORTS OF RICH STUFFS AND FINE LINEN TO HIS LODGING FROM THE CAVERN BUT WITH ALL THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TO CONCEAL THE PLACE WHENCE HE BROUGHT THEM
FOUR NEIGHBORS CARRIED THE CORPSE TO THE BURYING GROUND FOLLOWING THE IMAUN WHO RECITED SOME PRAYERS
AND THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME NAMED CHAMPION OF THE DAY
THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF NEEDLES AND PINS FROM A FOOT TO HALF A YARD LONG
WHILE THESE THINGS WERE BEING DONE THE FORTY ROBBERS AGAIN VISITED THEIR RETREAT IN THE FOREST
WHEN THIS WAS DONE I WENT DOWN THE SHIP'S SIDE AND PULLING THEM TO ME I TIED FOUR OF THEM TOGETHER AT BOTH ENDS AS WELL AS I COULD IN THE FORM OF A RAFT AND LAYING TWO OR THREE SHORT PIECES OF PLANK UPON THEM CROSSWAYS I FOUND I COULD WALK UPON IT VERY WELL BUT THAT IT WAS NOT ABLE TO BEAR ANY GREAT WEIGHT THE PIECES BEING TOO LIGHT
THE SOUND OF THE VOICE HAD HOWEVER ALSO REACHED THE OLD MAN'S EARS
HOWEVER I WOULD NOT TRUST TO THE STRENGTH OF IT ANY MORE IN SUCH DANGEROUS ENTERPRISES
TO INVOKE YOUR PITY SAID THE LOVELY JEWESS WITH A VOICE SOMEWHAT TREMULOUS WITH EMOTION WOULD I AM AWARE BE AS USELESS AS I SHOULD HOLD IT MEAN
THERE'S THIRTY HEARTS THERE THAT WOULD HAVE SPENT THEIR LIFE-BLOOD ERE YE HAD SCRATCHED YOUR FINGER
BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP I GAVE HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD SOME VALUABLE FURNITURE IN MY BOX TOO GOOD TO BE LOST
EIGHT YEARS BEFORE BUNYAN'S BIRTH 74 PURITAN MEN AND 28 WOMEN MEMBERS OF DR ROBINSON'S CHURCH ESCAPED PERSECUTION BY SAILING IN THE MAYFLOWER AND LANDING AT PLYMOUTH ROCK
AND NOW WERE THESE TWO MEN AS TWERE IN HEAVEN BEFORE THEY CAME AT IT BEING SWALLOWED UP WITH THE SIGHT OF ANGELS AND WITH HEARING OF THEIR MELODIOUS NOTES
I THOUGHT MYSELF IN A DREAM AND COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE MYSELF OUT OF DANGER
SHE SPENT ALL THE NIGHT IN WEEPING
TOM SMITH TOM SMITH ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY IS THAT ROBINSON FOR IT SEEMS HE KNEW THE VOICE
EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MAGICIAN CALLED AGAIN FOR ALADDIN AND SAID HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO SPEND THAT DAY IN THE COUNTRY AND ON THE NEXT HE WOULD PURCHASE THE SHOP
LET EACH FRONT CONTAIN SIX WINDOWS AND LET THE LATTICES OF THESE EXCEPT ONE WHICH MUST BE LEFT UNFINISHED BE ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES AND EMERALDS SO THAT THEY SHALL EXCEED EVERYTHING OF THE KIND EVER SEEN IN THE WORLD
RASPE I HAD MARRIED A LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY WHO HAVING HEARD OF MY SPORTING EXPLOITS DESIRED A SHORT TIME AFTER OUR MARRIAGE TO GO OUT WITH ME ON A SHOOTING EXPEDITION
BY WHICH I PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS SOME INDRAFT OF THE WATER AND CONSEQUENTLY I HOPED TO FIND SOME CREEK OR RIVER THERE WHICH I MIGHT MAKE USE OF AS A PORT TO GET TO LAND WITH MY CARGO
IT WAS A DEMAND TO SURRENDER THE PRISONERS WITHIN ONE HOUR FAILING WHICH THE CASTLE WOULD BE INSTANTLY BESIEGED
WE HAD SEVERAL SPARE YARDS AND TWO OR THREE LARGE SPARS OF WOOD AND A SPARE TOPMAST OR TWO IN THE SHIP
I AM SORRY I HAVE BROUGHT THEE OUT OF THE WAY AND THAT I HAVE PUT THEE INTO SUCH IMMINENT DANGER
MUCH ALARMED HE WENT SOFTLY DOWN INTO THE YARD AND GOING TO THE FIRST JAR WHILE ASKING THE ROBBER WHOM HE THOUGHT ALIVE IF HE WAS IN READINESS SMELLED THE HOT BOILED OIL WHICH SENT FORTH A STEAM OUT OF THE JAR
THEY RETIRED IN THE DAYTIME TO THEIR DENS WHERE THEY HID THEMSELVES FROM THE ROC THEIR ENEMY AND CAME OUT ONLY IN THE NIGHT
WHEN THIS ACTION WORTHY OF THE COURAGE OF MORGIANA WAS EXECUTED WITHOUT ANY NOISE AS SHE HAD PROJECTED SHE RETURNED INTO THE KITCHEN WITH THE EMPTY KETTLE
BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF INSTEAD OF INQUIRING HOW I CAME THITHER BEGAN TO QUARREL WITH ME AND ASKED WHY I STOLE HIS GOODS
LET IT SUFFICE TO INFORM HIM THAT IN OUR PASSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE EAST INDIES WE WERE DRIVEN BY A VIOLENT STORM TO THE NORTHWEST OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
I THEN TOOK UP A GREAT STONE AND SLEW HIM
I HIRED A HORSE AND GUIDE FOR FIVE SHILLINGS WHICH I BORROWED OF THE CAPTAIN
PRO-DI-GI-OUS THE KINDLY INTEREST OF MEG MERRILIES IN THE FATE OF BERTRAM DID NOT HOWEVER END HERE
I AM ONLY THE SLAVE OF THE RING AND NOT OF THE LAMP I COMMAND THEE THEN REPLIED ALADDIN BY THE POWER OF THE RING TO TRANSPORT ME TO THE SPOT WHERE MY PALACE STANDS IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD SOEVER IT MAY BE THESE WORDS WERE NO SOONER OUT OF HIS MOUTH THAN THE GENIE TRANSPORTED HIM INTO AFRICA TO THE MIDST OF A LARGE PLAIN WHERE HIS PALACE STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM A CITY AND PLACING HIM EXACTLY UNDER THE WINDOW OF THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT LEFT HIM
HE HAD WALKED FOR SOME DISTANCE WHEN HE STOPPED AT A SMALL PUBLIC-HOUSE TO PROCURE REFRESHMENT
THE FIRST JOLT HAD LIKE TO HAVE SHAKEN ME OUT OF MY HAMMOCK BUT AFTERWARD THE MOTION WAS EASY ENOUGH
I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED HOW I BROUGHT ALL MY GOODS INTO THIS PALE AND INTO THE CAVE WHICH I HAD MADE BEHIND ME
AS I PERCEIVED HER COMING I CREPT CLOSE TO THE EGG SO THAT I HAD BEFORE ME ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE BIRD WHICH WAS AS BIG AS THE TRUNK OF A TREE
IT IS TO STAY WITH ME THAT YOU MAY EDIFY ME WITH YOUR WAY OF LIVING AND THAT I MAY LEARN FROM YOUR GOOD EXAMPLE PRINCESS SAID THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA I BEG OF YOU NOT TO ASK WHAT I CANNOT CONSENT TO WITHOUT NEGLECTING MY PRAYERS AND DEVOTION THAT SHALL BE NO HINDRANCE TO YOU ANSWERED THE PRINCESS
BUT AS GOD WOULD HAVE IT WHILE APOLLYON WAS FETCHING OF HIS LAST BLOW THEREBY TO MAKE A FULL END OF THIS GOOD MAN CHRISTIAN NIMBLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR HIS SWORD AND CAUGHT IT SAYING REJOICE NOT AGAINST ME O MINE ENEMY
BUT I NEVER WENT OUT OF THE SHIP TILL WE CAME INTO THE DOWNS WHICH WAS ON THE THIRD DAY OF JUNE 1706 ABOUT NINE MONTHS AFTER MY ESCAPE
ALADDIN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO SUCH TRAFFIC TOLD HIM HE WOULD TRUST TO HIS JUDGMENT AND HONOR
WHEN HE WAS COME UP TO CHRISTIAN HE BEHELD HIM WITH A DISDAINFUL COUNTENANCE AND THUS BEGAN TO QUESTION WITH HIM
NOW GUY MANNERING HIMSELF AMONGST OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS POSSESSED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE STARS
I WOULD SOMETIMES LIE DOWN AND LET FIVE OR SIX OF THEM DANCE ON MY HAND
IN ORDER TO DISPOSE OF THE MERCHANDISE WHEN HE HAD THUS AMASSED THEM TOGETHER HE TOOK A WAREHOUSE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE OPPOSITE TO CASSIM'S WHICH ALI BABA'S SON HAD OCCUPIED SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS UNCLE
GLUMDALCLITCH WAS PREVAILED ON TO BE OF THE COMPANY VERY MUCH AGAINST HER INCLINATION FOR SHE WAS NATURALLY TENDER HEARTED
HOWEVER I MADE A SHIFT TO CREEP ON ALL FOURS AND SHELTER MYSELF BY LYING FLAT ON MY FACE ON THE LEE-SIDE OF A BORDER OF LEMON-THYME
NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS THE SUN WAS UP WE EXPLORED THE ISLAND AND SAW SOME HOUSES WHICH WE APPROACHED
GOD BLESS YOU WITH ALL HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY
THEREFORE JUDGE HOW I SHOULD FEEL AT YOUR TABLE IF THAT IS THE ONLY REASON SAID ALI BABA IT OUGHT NOT TO DEPRIVE ME OF THE HONOR OF YOUR COMPANY
YOU'VE MISSED YOUR BLOW YE BLOOD SPILLER
SHE SEVERELY REPRIMANDED THE GARDENER ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DOG
BUT THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY WAS TO RAISE AND PLACE ME IN THIS VEHICLE
BUT AMONG US ALL WE CANNOT FURNISH JEWELS ENOUGH FOR SO GREAT A WORK I HAVE MORE THAN ARE NECESSARY SAID THE SULTAN
AND NOW I BEGAN TO APPLY MYSELF TO MAKE SUCH NECESSARY THINGS AS I FOUND I MOST WANTED PARTICULARLY A CHAIR AND A TABLE
ON THE THIRD DAY HE WANDERED INTO THE COUNTRY AND AS HE WAS APPROACHING A RIVER HE FELL DOWN THE BANK WITH SO MUCH VIOLENCE THAT HE RUBBED THE RING WHICH THE MAGICIAN HAD GIVEN HIM SO HARD BY HOLDING ON THE ROCK TO SAVE HIMSELF THAT IMMEDIATELY THE SAME GENIE APPEARED WHOM HE HAD SEEN IN THE CAVE WHERE THE MAGICIAN HAD LEFT HIM
CASSIM'S WIFE CONSIDERING HOW MUCH IT CONCERNED HER HUSBAND TO KEEP THE BUSINESS SECRET WAS THE MORE EASILY PERSUADED TO BELIEVE HER BROTHER-IN-LAW
UNWILLING TO BE FOUND ENGAGED IN HIS HELLISH OCCUPATION THE SAVAGE BARON GAVE THE SLAVES A SIGNAL TO RESTORE ISAAC'S GARMENT AND HASTILY QUITTED THE DUNGEON WITH HIS ATTENDANTS
WHO AS I WAS HIS CREATURE HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT BY CREATION TO GOVERN AND DISPOSE OF ME ABSOLUTELY AS HE THOUGHT FIT
THEY WERE JUST GOING INTO THE BOAT WHEN FRIDAY AND THE MATE HALLOOED
THE SULTAN'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS PROMISED ME AS MY BRIDE IS THIS NIGHT MARRIED TO THE SON OF THE GRAND VIZIER
AND REACHING ONE OF HIS PAWS IN AT THE DOOR AS A CAT DOES WHEN SHE PLAYS WITH A MOUSE ALTHOUGH I OFTEN SHIFTED PLACE TO AVOID HIM HE AT LENGTH SEIZED THE LAPPET OF MY COAT WHICH BEING MADE OF THAT COUNTRY SILK WAS VERY THICK AND STRONG AND DRAGGED ME OUT
I FELLED A CEDAR-TREE AND I QUESTION MUCH WHETHER SOLOMON EVER HAD SUCH A ONE FOR THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM
THE MANIAC FIGURE OF ULRICA WAS FOR A LONG TIME VISIBLE ON THE LOFTY STAND SHE HAD CHOSEN TOSSING HER ARMS ABROAD WITH WILD EXULTATION
HE REACHED THE VILLAGE AT LENGTH AND ENGAGED A ROOM AT THE GORDON ARMS A COMFORTABLE INN KEPT BY A MRS MAC-CANDLISH
THE LAIRD AND HIS SERVANTS RUSHED AWAY TO THE WOOD OF WARROCH
I EMBARKED IN A VESSEL THAT HAPPILY ARRIVED AT BUSSORAH
FEW OF THEM ASKED QUARTER NONE RECEIVED IT
LET HIM LOOK TO HIS BOND SAID SHYLOCK LET HIM LOOK TO HIS BOND MEANWHILE BASSANIO HAD REACHED BELMONT AND HAD VISITED THE FAIR PORTIA
AND THE TWO WERE ABOUT TO HASTEN AWAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROCURING AID WHEN A THIRD PERSON SUDDENLY APPEARED AND COMMANDED THEM BOTH TO HALT
THIS ENVOY HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO REPRESENT TO THE MONARCH OF BLEFUSCU THE GREAT LENITY OF HIS MASTER WHO WAS CONTENT TO PUNISH ME NO FURTHER THAN WITH THE LOSS OF MY EYES
THE DOG FOLLOWING THE SCENT CAME DIRECTLY UP AND TAKING ME IN HIS MOUTH RAN STRAIGHT TO HIS MASTER WAGGING HIS TAIL AND SET ME GENTLY ON THE GROUND
AND WITH THAT HE GAVE A DESPERATE STRUGGLE OR TWO AND GOT OUT OF THE MIRE ON THAT SIDE OF THE SLOUGH WHICH WAS NEXT TO HIS OWN HOUSE
AFTER WHICH I WAS QUITE IN THE DARK FOR ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEN MY BOX BEGAN TO RISE SO HIGH THAT I COULD SEE LIGHT FROM THE TOPS OF THE WINDOWS
THE WHOLE STORY AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH I SHALL FAITHFULLY RELATE
THE DOMINIE BELIEVING SHE WAS SOME SORCERESS ADDRESSED HER IN LATIN BUT THE GIPSY QUEEN ANGRILY INTERRUPTED HIM
AT NIGHT WE WENT TO SLEEP ON THE SEA-SHORE
WITH THAT HE LOOKED UGLY UPON THEM AND RUSHING TO THEM HAD DOUBTLESS MADE AN END OF THEM HIMSELF BUT THAT HE FELL INTO ONE OF HIS FITS FOR HE SOMETIMES IN SUN-SHINE WEATHER FELL INTO FITS AND LOST FOR A TIME THE USE OF HIS HAND
THE FEAR OF DEATH UNDER WHICH I LABORED TURNED ALL MY FOOD INTO POISON
ON THESE CONDITIONS I AM READY TO BESTOW THE PRINCESS MY DAUGHTER UPON HIM
5TH
UNSCATHED BY THE LANCE OF HIS ENEMY HE HAD DIED A VICTIM TO THE VIOLENCE OF HIS OWN CONTENDING PASSIONS
HE HAD AN ONLY SON WILFRED BY NAME WITH WHOM HE HAD QUARRELLED
THEREFORE I HAVE SHUT MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE PROMISES AND THERE NOW REMAINS TO ME NOTHING BUT THREATNINGS DREADFUL THREATNINGS FEARFUL THREATNINGS OF CERTAIN JUDGMENT AND FIERY INDIGNATION WHICH SHALL DEVOUR ME AS AN ADVERSARY
AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT DID NOT HESITATE TO AID IN PROCURING FALSE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE UNFORTUNATE JEWESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH BEAUMANOIR FROM WHOM HE HAD KEPT SECRET THE PRESENCE OF REBECCA IN THE HOLY PRECINCTS
THE SHIP SLACKENED HER SAILS AND I CAME UP WITH HER BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX IN THE EVENING SEPTEMBER 26TH
AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED A DREAM
HAVING THUS PREPARED ALL THINGS AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE I SET SAIL ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1701 AT SIX IN THE MORNING
KNOW ME THEN FROM HENCEFORTH SAID THE BLACK KNIGHT AS RICHARD PLANTAGENET
I DESIRE NO RECOMPENSE ANSWERED HIS FELLOW TRAVELLER
AND THE COMPARISON OF PHAETON WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT FORBEAR APPLYING IT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MUCH ADMIRE THE CONCEIT
NEITHER IS THAT AT ALL TO BE WONDERED AT BECAUSE NATURE IN THAT COUNTRY OBSERVING THE SAME PROPORTION THROUGH ALL HER OPERATIONS A HAILSTONE IS NEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TIMES AS LARGE AS ONE IN EUROPE
THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THEY MUST NEEDS KNOW WOULD BE THE GALLOWS
THE FAITHFUL SERVANT AT ONCE SUGGESTED THAT HIS MASTER SHOULD CHANGE GARMENTS WITH HIM AND SO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
I WADED WITH WHAT HASTE I COULD AND SWAM IN THE MIDDLE ABOUT THIRTY YARDS TILL I FELT GROUND
BUT THAT WHICH COMFORTED ME MORE STILL WAS THAT LAST OF ALL AFTER I HAD MADE FIVE OR SIX SUCH VOYAGES AS THESE AND THOUGHT I HAD NOTHING MORE TO EXPECT FROM THE SHIP THAT WAS WORTH MY MEDDLING WITH--I SAY AFTER ALL THIS I FOUND A GREAT HOGSHEAD OF BREAD THREE LARGE RUNLETS OF RUM OR SPIRITS A BOX OF SUGAR AND A BARREL OF FINE FLOUR
HE GAVE ME A BOW AND ARROWS AND TAKING ME BEHIND HIM ON AN ELEPHANT CARRIED ME TO A THICK FOREST SOME LEAGUES FROM THE TOWN
I KEPT AMONG OTHER LITTLE NECESSARIES A PAIR OF SPECTACLES IN A PRIVATE POCKET WHICH AS I OBSERVED BEFORE HAD ESCAPED THE EMPEROR'S SEARCHERS
WHERE IT WAS OPPOSED BY NONE EXCEPT SKYRESH BOLGOLAM WHO WAS PLEASED WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION TO BE MY MORTAL ENEMY
GO TO THE BARBICAN SAID THE VICTOR IN A TONE OF AUTHORITY AND WAIT THERE MY FURTHER ORDERS YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
ALI BABA DID NOT VISIT THE ROBBERS CAVE FOR A WHOLE YEAR AS HE SUPPOSED THE OTHER TWO MIGHT BE ALIVE
I SPENT THE DAY IN WALKING ABOUT IN THE VALLEY RESTING MYSELF AT TIMES IN SUCH PLACES AS I THOUGHT MOST CONVENIENT
WE HAD VERY GOOD WEATHER ONLY EXCESSIVELY HOT ALL THE WAY UPON OUR OWN COAST TILL WE CAME TO THE HEIGHT OF CAPE ST AUGUSTINO
I TOLD MY WIFE SHE HAD BEEN TOO THRIFTY FOR I FOUND SHE HAD STARVED HERSELF AND DAUGHTER TO NOTHING
SHE IS THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE TOWN FOR HER FASTING HER AUSTERITIES AND HER EXEMPLARY LIFE
SIRE I PRAY YOU TO LET ME KNOW THE CRIME BY WHICH I HAVE THUS LOST THE FAVOR OF THY COUNTENANCE YOUR CRIME ANSWERED THE SULTAN WRETCHED MAN
BUT NONE COULD GUESS WHO HE MIGHT BE
THEN BIDDING THEM GOOD-BYE HE STARTED TO FOLLOW MEG MERRILIES ACCOMPANIED BY DINMONT WHO HAD COME UP A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
THEREFORE TO HIM LET ME GIVE LASTING PRAISE AND THANK AND BLESS HIS HOLY NAME ALWAYS
GABRIEL THE HUNTSMAN ON THE MOORS HE SAID HAD INFORMED HIM IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT BERTRAM WAS IN GAOL AND THAT HE WAS BADLY IN NEED OF A GOOD FRIEND TO STAY WITH HIM NIGHT AND DAY FOR A DAY OR TWO
I WENT UP THE SHORE AND DOWN THE SHORE BUT IT WAS ALL ONE
I WAS NOT ABLE TO LIFT UP THE ROOF OF MY CLOSET WHICH OTHERWISE I CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE DONE AND SAT ON THE TOP OF IT
AT LENGTH I TOLD THEM THERE WOULD BE NOTHING DONE IN MY OPINION TILL NIGHT
AFTER LISTENING FOR SOME TIME I VENTURED TO RAISE MY HEAD AND LOOK ROUND WHEN TO MY UNSPEAKABLE JOY I PERCEIVED THE LION HAD BY THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE SPRANG AT ME JUMPED FORWARD AS I FELL INTO THE CROCODILE'S MOUTH
THEREFORE WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST SURPRISE OR TROUBLE HE CONFESSED ALL AND OFFERED HIS BROTHER PART OF HIS TREASURE TO KEEP THE SECRET
IT WAS THE KNIGHT OF IVANHOE
THINK ON THY SINS IT SAID REGINALD FRONT-DE-BOEUF
WHAT SAID SHE HAS ALI BABA GOLD SO PLENTIFUL AS TO MEASURE IT
FOR WHY SAID HE SHOULD YOU CHUSE LIFE SEEING IT IS ATTENDED WITH SO MUCH BITTERNESS
FOR BESIDES THAT MY AGE NOW REQUIRED REST I WAS RESOLVED NO MORE TO EXPOSE MYSELF TO SUCH RISKS AS I HAD ENCOUNTERED SO THAT I THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT TO PASS THE REST OF MY DAYS IN TRANQUILLITY
WOULD YOU DESTROY THIS FINE OLD CASTLE SIR HIS FACE PERSON AND VOICE WERE SO EXACTLY LIKE THOSE OF HIS FATHER WHEN ALIVE THAT GLOSSIN ALMOST BELIEVED THAT THE GRAVE HAD GIVEN UP ITS DEAD
WHERE A LITTLE CONTEMPTIBLE VARLET WITHOUT THE LEAST TITLE TO BIRTH PERSON WIT OR COMMON-SENSE SHALL PRESUME TO LOOK WITH IMPORTANCE AND PUT HIMSELF UPON A FOOT WITH THE GREATEST PERSONS OF THE KINGDOM
THERE ARE MANY SORTS OF TRADES
SHE ONLY CAST AT HIM A SORROWFUL LOOK EXPRESSIVE OF GREAT AFFLICTION
AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE WITH THE FORMER PARTNER OF HIS GUILT
AT THIS ALARMING SPECTACLE I CONTINUED IMMOVABLE AND WAS SO MUCH TERRIFIED THAT MY BOW AND ARROWS FELL OUT OF MY HAND
A SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS WHO HAD BEEN FRIENDS WITH ROSALIND WHEN SHE WAS HERSELF DISGUISED AS A SHEPHERD WERE MARRIED ON THE SAME DAY AND ALL WITH SUCH PRETTY FEASTINGS AND MERRY-MAKINGS AS COULD BE NOWHERE WITHIN FOUR WALLS BUT ONLY IN THE BEAUTIFUL GREEN WOOD
AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THEY TOLD ME BY THE PERSON WHO SPOKE ARABIC AND INTERPRETED TO THEM WHAT I SAID THAT I MUST GO ALONG WITH THEM AND TELL MY STORY TO THEIR KING MYSELF
THAT IF THEY DID THEY WOULD BE FETCHED INTO THE CASTLE AND BE LAID IN IRONS
BUT OUR MEN HAD THE START OF HIM HALF A LEAGUE AND THE SEA THEREABOUT BEING FULL OF SHARP-POINTED ROCKS THE MONSTER WAS NOT ABLE TO OVERTAKE THE BOAT
OFTEN POINTING FORWARDS WHICH AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND WAS TOWARDS THE CAPITAL CITY ABOUT HALF A MILE DISTANT WHITHER IT WAS AGREED BY HIS MAJESTY IN COUNCIL THAT I MUST BE CONVEYED
AS HE WANDERED THROUGH THE FOREST A DOG WHICH HE RECOGNISED JUMPED UP AND FAWNED UPON HIM AND GURTH THE SWINEHERD SHORTLY AFTER MADE HIS APPEARANCE
BUT HIS ATTENTION AND THAT OF THE OTHER SPECTATORS WAS ARRESTED BY THE SOUND OF A SOLITARY TRUMPET WHICH BREATHED A NOTE OF DEFIANCE FROM THE NORTHERN END OF THE ENCLOSURE
THE CHAINS THAT HELD MY LEFT LEG WERE ABOUT TWO YARDS LONG AND GAVE ME NOT ONLY THE LIBERTY OF WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN A SEMICIRCLE BUT BEING FIXED WITHIN FOUR INCHES OF THE GATE ALLOWED ME TO CREEP IN AND LIE AT MY FULL LENGTH IN THE TEMPLE
THE SON OF THE BLESSED IS VERY PITIFUL
AT THE SAME TIME I HEARD THE REAPERS NOT ABOVE A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND ME
WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH MISS BERTRAM AND HER COMPANION A VOICE WAS HEARD CLOSE BY WHICH LUCY AT ONCE RECOGNISED AS THAT OF HER FATHER'S ENEMY GLOSSIN AND SHE SENT THE DOMINIE TO KEEP HIM AWAY
I ASSURED HIM THAT HE MUST BE MISTAKEN BY ALMOST HALF FOR I HAD NOT LEFT THE COUNTRY WHENCE I CAME ABOVE TWO HOURS BEFORE I DROPPED INTO THE SEA
AND THE LADY ROWENA THE JEW AND HIS DAUGHTER EXPERIENCED THE SAME MISFORTUNE
THE BED WAS EIGHT YARDS FROM THE FLOOR
GULLIVER IS SHIPWRECKED AND SWIMS FOR HIS LIFE BY JONATHAN SWIFT MY FATHER HAD A SMALL ESTATE IN NOTTINGHAMSHIRE
OR THE WONDERFUL LAMP THERE ONCE LIVED IN ONE OF THE LARGE AND RICH CITIES OF CHINA A TAILOR NAMED MUSTAPHA
AND HE WAS RECOGNISED BESIDES AS THE MOST TYRANNICAL OPPRESSOR OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE
AND THE NEXT DAY ALADDIN WHO COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HUNGER PUTTING ONE OF THE SILVER DISHES UNDER HIS VEST WENT OUT EARLY TO SELL IT AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A JEW WHOM HE MET IN THE STREETS TOOK HIM ASIDE AND PULLING OUT THE PLATE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD BUY IT
EMBRACE THY RELIGION AND WHAT RELIGION CAN IT BE THAT HARBOURS SUCH A VILLAIN
I WAS A FOOL THAT I DID NOT TRY TO DO IT BEFORE
IT IS A COMFORT FOR ME TO FIND AS IT WERE MY BROTHER IN A SON WHO HAS HIS MOST REMARKABLE FEATURES THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN PERCEIVING THAT THE WIDOW WEPT AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER HUSBAND CHANGED THE CONVERSATION AND TURNING TOWARD HER SON ASKED HIM WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU FOLLOW
THE CHARACTERS OF THIS LETTER WERE OF AZURE AND THE CONTENTS AS FOLLOWS
GULLIVER LEAVES LILLIPUT BY JONATHAN SWIFT THREE DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL WALKING OUT OF CURIOSITY TO THE NORTHEAST COAST OF THE ISLAND I OBSERVED ABOUT HALF A LEAGUE OFF IN THE SEA SOMEWHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE A BOAT OVERTURNED
OR BUT HE MAY IN SHORT TIME HAVE ANOTHER OF HIS FITS BEFORE US AND MAY LOSE THE USE OF HIS LIMBS
THUS SINDBAD FINISHED THE STORY OF HIS THIRD VOYAGE
I COULD HANG DRAW GIVE LIBERTY AND TAKE IT AWAY AND NO REBELS AMONG ALL MY SUBJECTS
IVANHOE WAS SOON ON FOOT HASTENING TO MEND HIS FORTUNE WITH HIS SWORD
ALL THE REMEDY THAT OFFERED TO MY THOUGHTS AT THAT TIME WAS TO GET UP INTO A THICK BUSHY TREE LIKE A FIR BUT THORNY WHICH GREW NEAR ME AND WHERE I RESOLVED TO SIT ALL NIGHT AND CONSIDER THE NEXT DAY WHAT DEATH I SHOULD DIE FOR AS YET I SAW NO PROSPECT OF LIFE
AND BEFORE I SHOW IT ALL TO YOU TELL ME FIRST WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS HALL UPON THIS QUESTION THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA SURVEYED THE HALL FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
WE HAD ON BOARD NO LARGE CARGO OF GOODS EXCEPT OF SUCH TOYS AS WERE FIT FOR OUR TRADE WITH THE NEGROES SUCH AS BEADS BITS OF GLASS SHELLS AND OTHER TRIFLES ESPECIALLY LITTLE LOOKING-GLASSES KNIVES SCISSORS HATCHETS AND THE LIKE
AND I MADE NO DOUBT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WELL ENOUGH WITH THE TEN THAT WERE COMING CONSIDERING THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR HONEST MEN AMONG THEM ALSO
GIVE HIM THIS LETTER DON'T FAIL AND TELL HIM THE TIME'S COMING NOW
BUT LIKE MANY MORE OF THE CONQUERED ENGLISH PEOPLE HE HAD FELT THE TYRANNY AND OPPRESSIVE INSOLENCE OF THE HAUGHTY NORMAN BARONS
FAREWELL AND SO SAYING THE TEMPLAR LEFT THE APARTMENT
I HAD SEPARATED MYSELF SOMEWHAT FROM MY COMPANIONS WHEN IN THE OPENING OF A BEAUTIFUL GLADE I BEHELD A NOBLE STAG WITH A FINE FULL-GROWN CHERRY-TREE ABOVE TEN FEET HIGH BETWEEN HIS ANTLERS
MY GREATEST APPREHENSION WAS FOR MINE EYES WHICH I SHOULD HAVE INFALLIBLY LOST IF I HAD NOT SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF AN EXPEDIENT
THEN HIS HORSE
NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT COLONEL MANNERING ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF KIPPLETRINGAN A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE TIME AT WHICH THE SALE OF ELLANGOWAN WAS TO TAKE PLACE
AND WHAT HEART COULD FORBEAR TO BLESS HIM WHO HAD NOT ONLY IN A MIRACULOUS MANNER PROVIDED FOR ME IN SUCH A WILDERNESS AND IN SUCH A DESOLATE CONDITION BUT FROM WHOM EVERY DELIVERANCE MUST ALWAYS BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO PROCEED
HAVING KNOCKED THIS FELLOW DOWN THE OTHER WHO PURSUED HIM STOPPED AS IF HE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED AND I ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM
AND THAT IT WAS MY BUSINESS TO BE GONE BEFORE THE TIDE OF FLOOD BEGAN OTHERWISE I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO REACH THE SHORE AT ALL
WHEN THE CAPTAIN SAW THEM ALL READY HE PUT HIMSELF AT THEIR HEAD AND THEY RETURNED THE WAY THEY HAD COME
WHEN MANNERING ARRIVED AT MR MERVYN'S HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE INFORMATION WHICH HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS RETURN
OUR COURSE WAS EAST NORTHEAST THE WIND WAS AT SOUTHWEST
MY SON SAID SHE YOU MAY REJOICE YOU ARE ARRIVED AT THE HEIGHT OF YOUR DESIRES
BECAUSE THE HOUR AND THE MAN ARE BOTH COME AT THE APPOINTED SIGNAL BERTRAM AND HIS COMPANIONS RUSHED UPON HATTERAICK
I LOOKED I THOUGHT LIKE SAUL WHO COMPLAINED NOT ONLY THAT THE PHILISTINES WERE UPON HIM BUT THAT GOD HAD FORSAKEN HIM
IN HIS TERROR AT THE THOUGHT OF LOSING HIS PROPERTY AT ELLANGOWAN IF IT CAME TO BE KNOWN THAT HARRY BERTRAM WAS ALIVE YET AT ALL TIMES FERTILE IN EVERY KIND OF VILLAINOUS DEVICE GLOSSIN NOW HIT UPON A NEW PLAN TO GET RID OF THE MAN WHO STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PEACE OF MIND
ALL THIS TIME THE POOR MAN WAS IN AS GREAT AN ECSTASY AS I ONLY NOT UNDER ANY SURPRISE AS I WAS AND HE SAID A THOUSAND KIND AND TENDER THINGS TO ME TO COMPOSE AND BRING ME TO MYSELF
WHEN HE HAD MADE AN END OF HIS STORY HE CHARMED HER INTO SLEEP FOR ARIEL WAS AT HAND AND HE HAD WORK FOR HIM TO DO
WHEN THIS WAS DONE ALI BABA HID THE JARS AND WEAPONS
SOME OF THEM WERE EXCEEDING GLAD AND LOOKED UPWARD
WHEN AT LENGTH HE BEGAN TO COME TO HIMSELF OUT OF HIS AGONY OF TERROR HE SAID THAT HE HAD HIRED A BODY-GUARD OF SIX MEN AT ASHBY TOGETHER WITH MULES FOR CARRYING THE LITTER OF A SICK FRIEND
IT WAS ABOUT TWELVE AT NOON AND A SERVANT BROUGHT IN DINNER
LET ITS WALLS BE MASSIVE GOLD AND SILVER BRICKS LAID ALTERNATELY
THE LIFE THAT WE NOW LIVE IS MISERABLE
AND ACCORDINGLY THE SHIP BEING FITTED OUT AND THE CARGO FURNISHED AND ALL THINGS DONE AS BY AGREEMENT BY MY PARTNERS IN THE VOYAGE I WENT ON BOARD IN AN EVIL HOUR THE LST OF SEPTEMBER 1659 BEING THE SAME DAY EIGHT YEARS THAT I WENT FROM MY FATHER AND MOTHER AT HULL
AND THAT INDEED THERE WAS LITTLE LEFT IN HER THAT I WAS ABLE TO BRING AWAY IF I HAD HAD MORE TIME
IN A LITTLE TIME I BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HIM AND TEACH HIM TO SPEAK TO ME
ALL THAT I COULD DO WAS TO WAIT TILL THE TIDE WAS AT THE HIGHEST KEEPING THE RAFT WITH MY OAR LIKE AN ANCHOR TO HOLD THE SIDE OF IT FAST TO THE SHORE NEAR A FLAT PIECE OF GROUND WHICH I EXPECTED THE WATER WOULD FLOW OVER
SHE HAD A LIGHT SAPLING IN HER HAND AND AS THE LAIRD LOOKED UP TO WHERE SHE STOOD SHE SAID TO HIM
SO RIDE YOUR WAY FOR THESE ARE THE LAST WORDS YE'LL EVER HEAR MEG MERRILIES SPEAK AND THIS IS THE LAST TWIG THAT I'LL EVER CUT IN THE BONNY WOODS OF ELLANGOWAN AND HAVING UTTERED THIS DARK AND THREATENING SPEECH SHE TURNED CONTEMPTUOUSLY FROM HIM TO JOIN HER COMRADES IN MISFORTUNE
BUT I WAS SOON RELIEVED BY ONE OF OUR SERVANTS WHO WRUNG OFF THE BIRD'S NECK AND I HAD HIM NEXT DAY FOR DINNER BY THE QUEEN'S COMMAND
ACCORDINGLY AS SOON AS WOODBOURNE WAS MADE READY TO RECEIVE THEM THE COLONEL AND HIS DAUGHTER JULIA TOOK UP THEIR RESIDENCE THERE AND LUCY BERTRAM BECAME THEIR GUEST
I PROSTRATED MYSELF A SECOND TIME AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I CAN ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY HE DOTH NOT EXCEED THE TRUTH
A RAPID CURRENT CARRIES THE SHIP ALONG WITH IT AND WE SHALL ALL PERISH IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BUT THE EAGERNESS OF MY FANCY PREVAILED AND TO WORK I WENT
BUT LET ME NOW RELATE THAT WHICH HAPPENED TO MYSELF SOME LITTLE TIME AGO
BUT DISCOVERING A LEAK WE UNSHIPPED OUR GOODS AND WINTERED THERE
SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE TOLD DEMETRIUS THAT HERMIA WAS GOING AS SHE WAS TO THE WOOD OUTSIDE ATHENS HE WOULD FOLLOW HER AND I CAN FOLLOW HIM AND AT LEAST I SHALL SEE HIM SHE SAID TO HERSELF
FAREWELL FRONT-DE-BOEUF
AND AMONG THOSE THAT DID SO THERE WERE TWO THAT RESOLVED TO FETCH HIM BACK BY FORCE
THE BOAT WHICH WAS A LARGE ONE DREW NEARER AND NEARER AND AS IT REACHED THE LAND SOME TWENTY MEN JUMPED ON SHORE AND DISAPPEARED UP A DARK PASSAGE WHICH DIVIDED THE PRISON FROM THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
AT LAST HE LAYS HIS HEAD FLAT UPON THE GROUND CLOSE TO MY FOOT AND SETS MY OTHER FOOT UPON HIS HEAD AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
ARE YOU OF ANY TRADE AT THIS QUESTION THE YOUTH HUNG DOWN HIS HEAD AND WAS NOT A LITTLE ABASHED WHEN HIS MOTHER ANSWERED ALADDIN IS AN IDLE FELLOW
WE PASSED BY SEVERAL ISLANDS AND AT LAST ARRIVED AT BUSSORAH FROM WHENCE I CAME TO THIS CITY WITH THE VALUE OF 100,000 SEQUINS
THE CEREMONIES OF MARRIAGE BEING OVER I WENT AND DWELT WITH MY WIFE AND FOR SOME TIME WE LIVED TOGETHER IN PERFECT HARMONY
SOME BORE FRUIT ENTIRELY WHITE AND SOME CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AS CRYSTAL
SHE PAUSED IN HER SINGING AND BROWN HEARD A FEW DEEP GROANS COME FROM THE DYING MAN
AS THE PRINCE ASSUMED HIS THRONE HE GAVE SIGNAL TO THE HERALDS TO PROCLAIM THE LAWS OF THE TOURNAMENT WHICH WERE BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS
TWO OF THEM SEIZED ON BERTRAM BUT ONE OF THEM WHISPERED IN HIS EAR MAKE NO RESISTANCE TILL YOU ARE OUTSIDE THEY DRAGGED HIM ROUGHLY TO THE GATE BUT AMID THE RIOT AND CONFUSION WHICH PREVAILED THE SOUND AS OF A BODY OF HORSE ADVANCING WAS HEARD
AND WHEN HE HAD OVERTAKEN HIM MADE A PROPOSAL TO HIM TO CHANGE CLOTHES WHICH THE MAN AGREED TO
SEVERAL OF THE MERCHANTS AND SEAMEN WERE DROWNED AND THE CARGO WAS LOST
HOW SHE SAVED HIS LIFE FROM SMUGGLERS WHO WOULD HAVE MURDERED HIM
BUT HE ADMITTED THAT TWO YEARS SINCE HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO STIR FROM HIS BED UNTIL THE REMEDIES APPLIED BY REBECCA'S DIRECTIONS HAD IN SOME DEGREE RESTORED THE USE OF HIS LIMBS
OLIVER WENT AND TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO GANYMEDE AND ALIENA AND ALIENA WAS SO CHARMED WITH HIS MANLY WAYS OF CONFESSING HIS FAULTS THAT SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AT ONCE
FOOTPRINTS OF MEN AND OF A SMALL BOY WERE SEEN HERE AND THERE
I WILL USE THY COURTESY FRANKLY--AND IT WILL GO HARD WITH ME BUT I WILL REQUITE IT THEY THEN PARTED AND TOOK DIFFERENT ROADS FOR THE TOWN OF SHEFFIELD
WE SOON FOUND THAT WHAT THE CAPTAIN HAD TOLD US WAS BUT TOO TRUE
AND HAVING IN THIS WAY SOLVED THE MYSTERY TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION HE STRODE QUICKLY ON THROUGH THE WOOD IN SEARCH OF THE HIGHROAD TO KIPPLETRINGAN
THE SEA BROKE STRANGE AND DANGEROUS
BE STILL I AM A FRIEND--CHARLES HAZLEWOOD HE HAD BEEN SENT AFTER THE OTHERS BY LUCY BERTRAM AND MISS MANNERING AND HAD ONLY OVERTAKEN THEM AS THEY WERE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO THE CAVERN
SUCH WAS THE SKILL OF EACH IN PARRYING AND STRIKING THAT THE SPECTATORS BROKE FORTH INTO A UNANIMOUS AND INVOLUNTARY SHOUT OF DELIGHT AND ADMIRATION
WHICH HOWEVER I COULD NOT FORBEAR LEST THE READER MIGHT THINK THOSE VAST CREATURES WERE ACTUALLY DEFORMED
WILFRED PLACING HIS FOOT ON HIS BREAST AND THE SWORD'S POINT TO HIS THROAT COMMANDED HIM TO YIELD HIM OR DIE ON THE SPOT
BY THIS MEANS I SAY WE HAD A FULL VIEW OF THEM AND THE CAPTAIN KNEW THE PERSONS AND CHARACTERS OF ALL THE MEN IN THE BOAT OF WHOM BE SAID THERE WERE THREE VERY HONEST FELLOWS WHO HE WAS SURE WERE LED INTO THIS CONSPIRACY BY THE REST BEING OVERPOWERED AND FRIGHTENED
THEY BEGAN TO CUT THAT FIRST
HE WENT THROUGH THEM WITH ALL THE PRECAUTION THE FEAR OF DEATH COULD INSPIRE CROSSED THE GARDEN WITHOUT STOPPING TOOK DOWN THE LAMP FROM THE NICHE THREW OUT THE WICK AND THE LIQUOR AND AS THE MAGICIAN HAD DESIRED PUT IT IN HIS WAISTBAND
WHEN THEY BAD ALL DECLARED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO STAY I THEN TOLD THEM I WOULD LET THEM INTO THE STORY OF MY LIVING THERE AND PUT THEM INTO THE WAY OF MAKING IT EASY TO THEM
FOR MY PART I ALWAYS BELIEVED AND HAVE HEARD SAY IT WANTED NOTHING
HE SLEPT THUS TILL MORNING
LISTEN YE FOOL TO WHAT I TELL YE SHE SAID OR YE'LL RUE IT WHILE THERE'S A LIMB O YE HANGS TOGETHER
THEY GAVE US THAT HERB AT FIRST ON PURPOSE TO DEPRIVE US OF OUR SENSES THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF THE SAD DESTINY PREPARED FOR US
UPON THIS HE SPOKE SOME WORDS TO ME AND THOUGH I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM YET I THOUGHT THEY WERE PLEASANT TO HEAR FOR THEY WERE THE FIRST SOUND OF A MAN'S VOICE THAT I HAD HEARD MY OWN EXCEPTED FOR ABOVE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS
I ALSO ENCOURAGED THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT IF IT LAY IN MY POWER TO SEND ANY VESSEL TO TAKE THEM IN I WOULD NOT FORGET THEM
HE WITH DIFFICULTY SUPPRESSED A SHOUT AND WAS MUCH RELIEVED WHEN HE HEARD A VOICE BEHIND HIM SAY
BY THIS MEANS ALL HER QUARTER WAS FREE AND ALL THAT WAS IN THAT PART WAS DRY
GULLIVER'S TRAVELS WAS WRITTEN BY JONATHAN SWIFT THE DEAN OF ST PATRICK'S CATHEDRAL IN DUBLIN ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL OF WRITERS WHOSE WORK WAS NOTABLY BRILLIANT IN THE FIELD OF POLITICS
ON OPENING THE PURSE WHICH THE GIPSY HAD GIVEN HIM HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT IT CONTAINED MONEY AND JEWELS WORTH ABOUT A HUNDRED POUNDS
I WILL PUT SOME OF THE JUICE OF THAT FLOWER ON MY TITANIA'S EYES AND WHEN SHE WAKES SHE WILL LOVE THE FIRST THING SHE SEES WERE IT LION BEAR OR WOLF OR BULL OR MEDDLING MONKEY OR A BUSY APE WHILE PUCK WAS GONE DEMETRIUS PASSED THROUGH THE GLADE FOLLOWED BY POOR HELENA AND STILL SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE LOVED HIM AND REMINDED HIM OF ALL HIS PROMISES AND STILL HE TOLD HER THAT HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT LOVE HER AND THAT HIS PROMISES WERE NOTHING
THE MARINERS AND PASSENGERS WERE ALL CRUSHED TO DEATH OR FELL INTO THE SEA
BEWILDERMENT AND ASTONISHMENT WERE DEPICTED ON THE FACES OF ALL AS BERTRAM STEPPED INTO THE PARLOUR
WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS MARK SAID SHE TO HERSELF
GLUMDALCLITCH OFTEN CARRIED ME INTO THE GARDENS OF THE COURT IN MY SMALLER BOX AND WOULD SOMETIMES TAKE ME OUT OF IT AND HOLD ME IN HER HAND OR SET ME DOWN TO WALK
WE HAD NOTHING NOW TO DO BUT TO WATCH FOR THEM IN THE DARK AND TO FALL UPON THEM SO AS TO MAKE SURE WORK WITH THEM
IN A WORD WE SAT LOOKING ONE UPON ANOTHER AND EXPECTING DEATH EVERY MOMENT AND EVERY MAN ACTING ACCORDINGLY AS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER WORLD
AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS OLD SAID HONEST MAN YOU BEGIN TO WORK VERY EARLY
DO ANSWERED THE GIPSY
WHAT MUST NOT A POOR OLD MAN HAVE SUFFERED IN THAT SEVERE WEATHER AND CLIMATE WHOM I SAW ON A BLEAK COMMON IN POLAND LYING ON THE ROAD HELPLESS SHIVERING AND HARDLY HAVING WHEREWITHAL TO COVER HIS NAKEDNESS
CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL ARE CAPTIVES IN DOUBTING CASTLE BY JOHN BUNYAN I SAW THEN THAT THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY TO A PLEASANT RIVER WHICH DAVID THE KING CALLED THE RIVER OF GOD BUT JOHN THE RIVER OF THE WATER OF LIFE
NORMANS BOTH MUTTERED CEDRIC
HE CRIED AND KISSED ME WHEN I TOLD HIM MY FATHER WAS DEAD AND GAVE ME MONEY SENDING HIS LOVE TO YOU AND PROMISING TO COME AND PAY YOU A VISIT THAT HE MAY SEE THE HOUSE MY FATHER LIVED AND DIED IN INDEED CHILD REPLIED THE MOTHER YOUR FATHER HAD NO BROTHER NOR HAVE YOU AN UNCLE THE NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN FOUND ALADDIN PLAYING IN ANOTHER PART OF THE TOWN AND EMBRACING HIM AS BEFORE PUT TWO PIECES OF GOLD INTO HIS HAND AND SAID TO HIM CARRY THIS CHILD TO YOUR MOTHER
I LIKEWISE FELT SEVERAL SLENDER LIGATURES ACROSS MY BODY FROM MY ARM-PITS TO MY THIGHS
COME THEN NEIGHBOR PLIABLE LET US TURN AGAIN AND GO HOME WITHOUT HIM
AND MORE THAN ONCE SHE CALLED THEM MURDERERS
AND IT IS LATE LATE SHE ADDED SHAKING HER GRAY HEAD ERE THESE OPEN TO US
THIS WAS A LARGE PIECE OF RAW MEAT
O DRUG SAID I ALOUD WHAT ART THOU GOOD FOR
AND THEY TOLD THEM
AND THEY TOLD THEM
I WILL PAY HE SAID
THEN DID CHRISTIAN DRAW FOR HE SAW TWAS TIME TO BESTIR HIM
THE SARACENS IN OBEDIENCE TO THIS SAVAGE ORDER HAD ALREADY TORN FROM THE FEEBLE AND STRUGGLING OLD MAN HIS UPPER GARMENT AND WERE PROCEEDING TOTALLY TO DISROBE HIM WHEN THE SOUND OF A BUGLE TWICE WINDED WITHOUT THE CASTLE PENETRATED EVEN TO THE RECESSES OF THE DUNGEON
THEY HAD RIDDEN TOGETHER FOR SOME DISTANCE WHEN THE QUICK EYE OF THE JESTER CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOME MEN IN ARMOUR CONCEALED IN A BRAKE NOT FAR FROM WHERE THEY WERE
BUT BESIDES THESE INFIRMITIES POSSESSED ME IN THY COUNTRY FOR THERE I SUCKED THEM IN AND I HAVE GROANED UNDER THEM BEEN SORRY FOR THEM AND HAVE OBTAINED PARDON OF MY PRINCE
AND WHEN YOU COME THERE YOU SHALL HAVE WHITE ROBES GIVEN YOU AND YOUR WALK AND TALK SHALL BE EVERY DAY WITH THE KING EVEN ALL THE DAYS OF ETERNITY
AND AS HE WANDERED THROUGH THE PLANTATIONS WHICH SKIRTED THE ROAD HE SAW A LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE AMONGST THE TREES
THEN THEY THRUST OPEN THE GATE TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE WITH SPEED
THAT HE DISCOVERED TWO STAPLES UPON ONE SIDE WHICH WAS ALL OF BOARDS WITHOUT ANY PASSAGE FOR LIGHT
NOW JUST AS THE GATES WERE OPENED TO LET IN THE MEN I LOOKED IN AFTER THEM AND BEHOLD THE CITY SHONE LIKE THE SUN
I WAS DIVERTED WITH NONE SO MUCH AS THAT OF THE ROPE-DANCES PERFORMED UPON A SLENDER WHITE THREAD EXTENDED ABOUT TWO FEET AND TWELVE INCHES FROM THE GROUND
AND WHAT HE WOULD HAVE
HIS NAME DWELLS NOT IN MY MEMORY HE SAID
WHEN NIGHT CAME THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM WERE AGAIN ATTENDED TO THEIR CHAMBER WITH THE SAME CEREMONIES AS ON THE PRECEDING EVENING
THE SKATING PARTY OF WHOM JULIA MANNERING WAS ONE CONSISTED OF HERSELF AND LUCY BERTRAM AND YOUNG CHARLES HAZLEWOOD WHO AS BEFORE MENTIONED WAS MISS BERTRAM'S LOVER
HE THEN LED HIM OUT AT ONE OF THE GATES OF THE CITY TO SOME MAGNIFICENT PALACES TO EACH OF WHICH BELONGED BEAUTIFUL GARDENS INTO WHICH ANYBODY MIGHT ENTER
DRAMATIC RENDERING OF DRAMATIC PASSAGES IS WORTH STRIVING FOR AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED ON THE PART OF CHILDREN
BUT HAD ANY ONE IN ENGLAND MET SUCH A MAN AS I WAS IT MUST EITHER HAVE FRIGHTENED HIM OR RAISED A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHTER
BUT AS HE HAD HIS UNCLE'S PERMISSION HE RESOLVED TO GATHER SOME OF EVERY SORT
THEN SAID THE MEN THAT MET THEM YOU HAVE BUT TWO DIFFICULTIES MORE TO MEET WITH AND THEN YOU ARE IN THE CITY
SHE BADE HER STAY A LITTLE AND SHE WOULD READILY FETCH ONE
AND HAZLEWOOD FANCYING FROM THE ROUGH APPEARANCE OF THE STRANGER THAT HE WAS EITHER A GIPSY OR A TRAMP POINTED HIS GUN TOWARDS HIM AND ORDERED HIM TO KEEP OFF
AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRINCE ORDERED HER TO BE SUMMONED TO HER AT ONCE
BUT WE RAN TO SUCH PLACES AS HE COULD NOT REACH
WHEN MIRANDA WAS GROWN UP INTO A MAIDEN SWEET AND FAIR TO SEE IT CHANCED THAT ANTONIO AND ALONSO WITH SEBASTIAN HIS BROTHER AND FERDINAND HIS SON WERE AT SEA TOGETHER WITH OLD GONZALO AND THEIR SHIP CAME NEAR PROSPERO'S ISLAND
AND THOUGH I AM ALIVE NOW PERHAPS IF IT WERE GONE I MIGHT NOT BE SO SOME MOMENTS HENCE
AND AT THE SAME TIME CHARGED ME WITH A LETTER FOR THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL OUR SOVEREIGN SAYING TO ME I PRAY YOU GIVE THIS PRESENT FROM ME AND THIS LETTER TO THE CALIPH HAROUN-AL-RASCHID AND ASSURE HIM OF MY FRIENDSHIP THE LETTER FROM THE KING OF SERENDIB WAS WRITTEN ON THE SKIN OF A CERTAIN ANIMAL OF GREAT VALUE VERY SCARCE AND OF A YELLOWISH COLOR
WHEN I CAME TO MY CASTLE FOR SO I THINK I CALLED IT EVER AFTER THIS I FLED INTO IT LIKE ONE PURSUED
ON DRINKING IT HE WILL INSTANTLY FALL ASLEEP AND WE WILL OBTAIN THE LAMP WHOSE SLAVES WILL DO ALL OUR BIDDING AND RESTORE US AND THE PALACE TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA THE PRINCESS OBEYED TO THE UTMOST HER HUSBAND'S INSTRUCTIONS
BUT ALL THE TIME ALADDIN'S MOTHER COULD NOT FORBEAR LOOKING AT AND ADMIRING THE TRAY AND DISHES THOUGH SHE COULD NOT JUDGE WHETHER THEY WERE SILVER OR ANY OTHER METAL AND THE NOVELTY MORE THAN THE VALUE ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION
IN SHORT I BEHAVED MYSELF SO UNACCOUNTABLY THAT THEY WERE ALL OF THE CAPTAIN'S OPINION WHEN HE FIRST SAW ME AND CONCLUDED I HAD LOST MY WITS
I SAW SINDBAD PERISH WITH MY OWN EYES AS DID ALSO THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD AND YET YOU TELL ME YOU ARE THAT SINDBAD
ABOUT THE SAME TIME ARRIVED CEDRIC THE SAXON WITH THE LADY ROWENA
BUT WHY THIS RELIGIOUS DRESS IT MATTERS NOT WHO I AM SAID CEDRIC
THE HORSE THAT FELL WAS STRAINED IN THE LEFT SHOULDER BUT THE RIDER GOT NO HURT AND I REPAIRED MY HANDKERCHIEF AS WELL AS I COULD
ALADDIN WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY BUT THE MAGICIAN CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND GAVE HIM SUCH A BOX ON THE EAR THAT HE KNOCKED HIM DOWN
UPON WHICH HE RETURNED TO THE HALL AND SHOWED THEM THE WINDOW WHICH WAS UNFINISHED
THIS EARNEST POWERFUL FIGHTING PURITAN PREACHER AROUSED HIS CONGREGATION SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT THE AUTHORITIES PUT HIM IN JAIL
WHEN ALADDIN HAD THUS PREPARED HIMSELF FOR HIS FIRST INTERVIEW WITH THE SULTAN HE DISMISSED THE GENIE AND IMMEDIATELY MOUNTING HIS CHARGER BEGAN HIS MARCH AND THOUGH HE NEVER WAS ON HORSEBACK BEFORE APPEARED WITH A GRACE THE MOST EXPERIENCED HORSEMAN MIGHT ENVY
HER SAXON LOVER WAS NOT ONE OF HER PARTY AT THE TOURNEY ON THE SECOND DAY
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER BERTRAM COULD HEAR A TUMULT IN THE OUTER YARD OF THE BRIDEWELL AND BEING UNABLE TO GUESS WHAT ITS MEANING WAS HE AWOKE DINMONT
FOR INDEED WHILE I WAS IN THAT PRINCE'S COUNTRY I COULD NEVER ENDURE TO LOOK IN A GLASS AFTER MINE EYES HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH PRODIGIOUS OBJECTS BECAUSE THE COMPARISONS GAVE ME SO DESPICABLE A CONCEIT OF MYSELF
YOU SHALL ALWAYS FIND ME READY TO KEEP MY WORD THIS PLAN JUST SUITED ALADDIN WHO HATED WORK
THEN SAID PLIABLE AH NEIGHBOR CHRISTIAN WHERE ARE YOU NOW
THAT MINISTER WAS GALBET OR ADMIRAL OF THE REALM VERY MUCH IN HIS MASTER'S CONFIDENCE AND A PERSON WELL VERSED IN AFFAIRS BUT OF A MOROSE AND SOUR COMPLEXION
MANY A WEARY STROKE IT HAD COST YOU MAY BE SURE
BUT THE POOR BEAST HAD SCARCELY STRENGTH ENOUGH TO FOLLOW ME SHE WAS SO THIN AND FAMISHED
I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO FIT UP THIS WINDOW IN AS GREAT PERFECTION AS THE REST
GO GET YOU DOWN TO YOUR DEN AGAIN
AND HE TOLD HER
THIS SIR SAID HE IS MY FATHER'S HOUSE WHO FROM THE ACCOUNT I HAVE GIVEN HIM OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP CHARGED ME TO PROCURE HIM THE HONOR OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
HAST LIVED TO MERIT OUR HATE AND EXECRATION
BUT HE ALSO DECLINED TO EXPLAIN THAT MATTER
THE EMPEROR AND ROYAL FAMILY CAME OUT OF THE PALACE
WITHOUT PASSIONS SULLENNESS OR DESIGNS PERFECTLY OBLIGED AND ENGAGED
HE SUSPECTED THERE WAS SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IN THIS SILENCE AND THEREUPON WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE SULTANESS'S APARTMENT TOLD HER IN WHAT A STATE HE FOUND THE PRINCESS AND HOW SHE HAD RECEIVED HIM
AND TURNING MY HEAD I FOUND IT PROCEEDED FROM THE PURRING OF THAT ANIMAL WHO SEEMED TO BE THREE TIMES LARGER THAN AN OX AS I COMPUTED BY THE VIEW OF HER HEAD AND ONE OF HER PAWS WHILE HER MISTRESS WAS FEEDING AND STROKING HER
I HOPE THE GENTLE READER WILL EXCUSE ME FOR DWELLING ON THESE AND THE LIKE PARTICULARS WHICH HOWEVER INSIGNIFICANT THEY MAY APPEAR TO GROVELLING VULGAR MINDS YET WILL CERTAINLY HELP A PHILOSOPHER TO ENLARGE HIS THOUGHTS AND IMAGINATION AND APPLY THEM TO THE BENEFIT OF PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE LIFE WHICH WAS MY SOLE DESIGN IN PRESENTING THIS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS OF MY TRAVELS TO THE WORLD
HE BOUNDED OVER A HEDGE WHICH DIVIDED THE FOOTPATH FROM THE PLANTATION AND WAS NOT HEARD OF AGAIN FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME
HE APPEARED TO BE OF A MIDDLE AGE AND TALLER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER THREE WHO ATTENDED HIM WHEREOF ONE WAS A PAGE THAT HELD UP HIS TRAIN AND SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN MY MIDDLE FINGER
THAT WOULD I HE ANSWERED WERE I KING OF ALL KINGDOMS THEN ROSALIND AND CELIA WENT OUT AND ROSALIND PUT ON HER PRETTY WOMAN'S CLOTHES AGAIN AND AFTER A WHILE CAME BACK
SIRE WE ARE ALL WILLING TO EXERT OUR UTMOST CARE AND INDUSTRY TO OBEY YOU
I TOLD HIS MAJESTY THAT IN EUROPE WE HAD NO MONKEYS EXCEPT SUCH AS WERE BROUGHT FOR CURIOSITIES FROM OTHER PLACES AND SO SMALL THAT I COULD DEAL WITH A DOZEN OF THEM TOGETHER IF THEY PRESUMED TO ATTACK ME
THE MAN SAID NO
THEN CALLING HIM AWAY I CARRIED HIM NOT TO MY CASTLE BUT QUITE AWAY TO MY CAVE ON THE FARTHER PART OF THE ISLAND
I ATE THEM BY TWO OR THREE AT A MOUTHFUL AND TOOK THREE LOAVES AT A TIME ABOUT THE BIGNESS OF MUSKET BULLETS
THE FIRST EDITION WAS GONE IN A WEEK AND WAS SELLING AT AN ADVANCED PRICE BEFORE THE SECOND EDITION COULD BE PRINTED
THE JUNIOR CLASSICS A LIBRARY FOR BOYS AND GIRLS ILLUSTRATION
HERE I STOOD SHE WENT ON STRETCHING OUT HER LONG SINEWY ARM AND CLENCHED HAND--"HERE I STOOD WHEN I TOLD THE LAST LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN WHAT WAS COMING ON HIS HOUSE AND DID THAT FALL TO THE GROUND
THE READER MAY REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SIGNED THOSE ARTICLES UPON WHICH I RECOVERED MY LIBERTY THERE WERE SOME WHICH I DISLIKED UPON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING TOO SERVILE NEITHER COULD ANYTHING BUT AN EXTREME NECESSITY HAVE FORCED ME TO SUBMIT
WHILE WE WERE ENJOYING OURSELVES EATING AND DRINKING AND RECOVERING FROM THE FATIGUE OF THE SEA THE ISLAND OF A SUDDEN TREMBLED AND SHOOK US TERRIBLY
HAVING IN IT SEVEN LITTLE HOLES ABOUT AS BIG AS I MIGHT PUT MY ARM OUT AT
ARE YOU AS WISE AS YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL IF I AM WISE ENOUGH TO FIND MY WAY OUT OF THIS WOOD THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME SAID THE FOOLISH CLOWN
WHEN AS SHE CAME NIGH THE FIRST JAR THE ROBBER WITHIN SAID SOFTLY IS IT TIME THOUGH NATURALLY MUCH SURPRISED AT FINDING A MAN IN THE JAR INSTEAD OF THE OIL SHE WANTED SHE IMMEDIATELY FELT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING SILENCE AS ALI BABA HIS FAMILY AND HERSELF WERE IN GREAT DANGER
THE SHRILL BUGLE WITHOUT WAS ANSWERED BY A FLOURISH OF NORMAN TRUMPETS FROM THE BATTLEMENTS WHILE THE CRIES OF BOTH PARTIES AUGMENTED THE FEARFUL DIN
SO I LEFT IT ON THAT ISSUE
AT THIS MOMENT WAMBA WINDED THE OUTLAW'S BUGLE WHICH HE HAD BEEN GIVEN TO CARRY
AND FINDING I HAD STRENGTH ENOUGH TO UNDERTAKE SO LONG A JOURNEY I MADE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS AND SET OUT
YES YES ANSWERED BABA MUSTAPHA
WHEN WE CAME TO LAND WE SAW NO RIVER OR SPRING NOR ANY SIGN OF INHABITANTS
AND I HAVE ANOTHER SECRET TO TELL YOU
TOWARDS MIDNIGHT BERTRAM WOKE AFTER HIS FIRST SLEEP
SHE TURNED NEITHER TO THE LEFT NOR THE RIGHT AND MOVED MORE LIKE A GHOST THAN A HUMAN BEING
AND WITH THAT THE BOTTOMLESS PIT OPENED JUST WHEREABOUT I STOOD
BUT HE WAS DEAF TO HER ENTREATIES
WHEREUPON THE HUGE CREATURE TROD SHORT AND LOOKING ROUND ABOUT UNDER HIM FOR SOME TIME AT LAST ESPIED ME AS I LAY ON THE GROUND
THEY THEREFORE WENT UP THROUGH THE REGIONS OF THE AIR SWEETLY TALKING AS THEY WENT BEING COMFORTED BECAUSE THEY SAFELY GOT OVER THE RIVER AND HAD SUCH GLORIOUS COMPANIONS TO ATTEND THEM
MAY YOU LIVE HAPPILY FOR A LONG TIME SINDBAD ORDERED HIM TO BE PAID ANOTHER HUNDRED SEQUINS AND TOLD HIM TO GIVE UP CARRYING BURDENS AS A PORTER AND TO EAT HENCEFORTH AT HIS TABLE FOR HE WISHED THAT HE SHOULD ALL HIS LIFE HAVE REASON TO REMEMBER THAT HE HENCEFORTH HAD A FRIEND IN SINDBAD THE SAILOR
I WENT ON SOMETIMES LOST SIGHT OF IT BUT ALWAYS FOUND IT AGAIN AND AT LAST DISCOVERED THAT IT CAME THROUGH A HOLE IN THE ROCK WHICH I GOT THROUGH AND FOUND MYSELF UPON THE SEASHORE AT WHICH I FELT EXCEEDING JOY
THE YOUNG SOLDIER COULD COME TO NO OTHER CONCLUSION BUT THAT THE WOMAN WAS MAD
PROCEED UNHAPPY WOMAN UNHAPPY ULRICA I SHOULD SAY FOR THOU CANST BE NONE OTHER WITH THY TALE OF HORROR AND GUILT
A VESSEL OF AGATE MORE BROAD THAN DEEP AN INCH THICK AND HALF A FOOT WIDE THE BOTTOM OF WHICH REPRESENTED IN BAS-RELIEF A MAN WITH ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND WHO HELD A BOW AND AN ARROW READY TO DISCHARGE AT A LION
WHEREAT ALTHOUGH I WAS MUCH ALARMED YET I VENTURED TO LOOK OUT BUT NOT STIRRING FROM MY SEAT
AT WHICH HE SEEMED VERY GLAD FOR HE WAS STARK NAKED
BUT I BECKONED WITH MY HAND TO HIM TO COME BACK AND IN THE MEANTIME I SLOWLY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TWO THAT FOLLOWED
THE POOR SAVAGE WHO FLED BUT HAD STOPPED THOUGH HE SAW BOTH HIS ENEMIES FALLEN AND KILLED AS HE THOUGHT YET WAS SO FRIGHTENED WITH THE FIRE AND NOISE OF MY PIECE THAT HE STOOD STOCK STILL AND NEITHER CAME FORWARD NOR WENT BACKWARD THOUGH HE SEEMED RATHER INCLINED STILL TO FLY THAN TO COME ON
THE FREE SCHOOL OF THE TOWN WAS OPEN TO ALL BOYS AND HIS FATHER COULD AFFORD TO SEND HIM TO IT
AND I HAD EVERYTHING SO READY AT MY HAND THAT IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURE TO ME TO SEE ALL MY GOODS IN SUCH ORDER AND ESPECIALLY TO FIND MY STOCK OF ALL NECESSARIES SO GREAT
BUT THIS HAD BEEN ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE MARSHALS OF THE FIELD WHO GUESSING THE CAUSE OF IVANHOE'S SWOON HAD HASTENED TO UNDO HIS ARMOUR AND FOUND THAT THE HEAD OF A LANCE HAD PENETRATED HIS BREAST-PLATE AND INFLICTED A WOUND IN HIS SIDE
I OBSERVED ONE THING WHICH TO ME APPEARED VERY EXTRAORDINARY
AND PARTICULARLY WAS SO MERRY SO CONSTANTLY DILIGENT AND SO PLEASED WHEN HE COULD BUT UNDERSTAND ME OR MAKE ME UNDERSTAND HIM THAT IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO ME TO TALK TO HIM
THIS WILL TESTIFY FOR ME THAT I WAS NOT IDLE AND THAT I SPARED NO PAINS TO BRING TO PASS WHATEVER APPEARED NECESSARY FOR MY COMFORTABLE SUPPORT FOR I CONSIDERED THE KEEPING UP A BREED OF TAME CREATURES THUS AT MY HAND WOULD BE A LIVING MAGAZINE OF FLESH MILK BUTTER AND CHEESE FOR ME AS LONG AS I LIVED IN THE PLACE IF IT WERE TO BE FORTY YEARS
WE EMBARKED ON BOARD A GOOD SHIP AND AFTER RECOMMENDING OURSELVES TO GOD SET SAIL
LYSANDER OF COURSE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH GRIEF AND THE BEST THING TO DO SEEMED TO HIM FOR HERMIA TO RUN AWAY TO HIS AUNT'S HOUSE AT A PLACE BEYOND THE REACH OF THAT CRUEL LAW
COME HITHER FOR I WOULD SPEAK WITH THEE SO SAYING SHE PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT THE UNWILLING CEDRIC INTO A SMALL APARTMENT THE DOOR OF WHICH SHE HEEDFULLY SECURED
IN A WORD I HAD NOTHING ABOUT ME BUT A KNIFE A TOBACCO-PIPE AND A LITTLE TOBACCO IN A BOX
TELL ME REPLIED HE CAN YOU SHOOT WITH A BOW I ANSWERED THAT THE BOW WAS ONE OF MY EXERCISES IN MY YOUTH
I RODE FULL SPEED TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE TO FETCH THE MINERS WHO AFTER GREAT EFFORTS SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING THE UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUALS BURIED IN THE PIT--WHICH MEASURED NINETY FEET--TO THE SURFACE
AS HE WAS PASSING BY IT THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED AND MEG MERRILIES STEPPED OUT AND STOOD BEFORE HIM
THEN APOLLYON BROKE OUT INTO A GRIEVOUS RAGE SAYING I AM AN ENEMY TO THIS PRINCE
VIZ THAT IT MUST BE SOME OF THE SAVAGES OF THE MAINLAND OPPOSITE WHO HAD WANDERED OUT TO SEA IN THEIR CANOES AND EITHER DRIVEN BY THE CURRENTS OR BY CONTRARY WINDS HAD MADE THE ISLAND AND HAD BEEN ON SHORE BUT WERE GONE AWAY AGAIN TO SEA
BUT CANST THOU NOT NOW REPENT AND TURN
THIS WALL I WAS MANY A WEARY MONTH IN FINISHING AND YET NEVER THOUGHT MYSELF SAFE TILL IT WAS DONE
BUT HE WILL HAVE ALL NOW
BUT AS THERE WAS LITTLE RELIEF IN THAT I RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO GET TO THE SHIP
AS FOR ARIEL PROSPERO MADE HIM FREE AS AIR SO THAT HE COULD WANDER WHERE HE WOULD AND SING WITH A LIGHT HEART HIS SWEET SONG WHERE THE BEE SUCKS THERE SUCK I
NOT WITHIN THE WALLS OF YORK RANSACK MY HOUSE AND THAT OF ALL MY TRIBE WILT THOU FIND THE TITHE OF THAT HUGE SUM OF SILVER PREPARE THEN SAID THE NORMAN FOR A LONG AND LINGERING DEATH AND HE ORDERED THE SLAVE TO MAKE READY THE FIRE
ON THE DAY THAT YOUNG HARRY BERTRAM WAS FIVE YEARS OLD DIRCK HATTERAICK'S SHIP WAS IN THE BAY OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE OF KIPPLETRINGAN
WHEN THE CAPTAIN AFTER COMMENDING HIS DILIGENCE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THEM ALL SAID COMRADES WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
AND WHEN I CAME UP TO IT I TOUCHED IT AND FOUND IT TO BE VERY SMOOTH
BY WHICH HE MEANT ME FOR THEY ALL CALLED ME GOVERNOR
THOUGH I FELT THE SEVERITY OF THE AIR MYSELF I THREW MY MANTLE OVER HIM AND IMMEDIATELY I HEARD A VOICE FROM THE HEAVENS BLESSING ME FOR THAT PIECE OF CHARITY SAYING
THEY WISHED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEAREST COTTAGE BUT SHE REFUSED TO BE MOVED ANYWHERE BUT TO THE KAIM OF DERNCLEUGH
TAKE MY LIFE IF THOU WILT AND SAY THE JEW AMIDST HIS TORTURES KNEW HOW TO DISAPPOINT THE CHRISTIAN STRIP HIM SLAVES
HE TALKED TO THEM OF THE INJURY DONE HIM OF THE CONDITION THEY WERE BROUGHT TO AND THAT THOUGH THE GOVERNOR HAD GIVEN THEM QUARTER FOR THEIR LIVES AS TO THE PRESENT ACTION YET THAT IF THEY WERE SENT TO ENGLAND THEY WOULD ALL BE HANGED IN CHAINS
THE VISOR OF THE BLUE KNIGHT WHO STILL LAY ENTANGLED UNDER HIS WOUNDED STEED WAS NOW OPENED AND THE FEATURES OF WALDEMAR FITZURSE WERE DISCLOSED
AND MY COMRADES WHO HAD LOST THEIR REASON ATE OF IT GREEDILY
DIRECTLY TITANIA WOKE AND SAW THIS DREADFUL MONSTER SHE SAID WHAT ANGEL IS THIS
IT WAS NOT LONG ERE IT REACHED THE CIRCLE OF THE PRINCE WHOSE BROW DARKENED AS HE HEARD THE NEWS
WAMBA THE JESTER ALONE ESCAPED SHOWING UPON THE OCCASION MUCH MORE COURAGE THAN THOSE WHO PRETENDED TO GREATER SENSE
AND BY WHAT ACCIDENT I CAME TO BE SET ADRIFT IN THAT MONSTROUS WOODEN CHEST
SHE FELL WITH A PIERCING SHRIEK MUTTERING I KNEW IT WOULD BE THIS WAY A TERRIFIC STRUGGLE ENSUED BETWEEN THE SMUGGLER AND HIS ASSAILANTS IN WHICH HATTERAICK CONTRIVED TO DISCHARGE A SECOND BULLET AT BERTRAM WHICH ONLY MISSED ITS MARK BY A LUCKY ACCIDENT
ON THE OTHER SIDE DISCOURSING OF THE LADIES IN THAT EMPEROR'S COURT HE USED TO TELL ME ONE HAD FRECKLES ANOTHER TOO WIDE A MOUTH A THIRD TOO LARGE A NOSE
THEY MUST HAVE ALL THEIR GOOD THINGS NOW THEY CANNOT STAY TILL NEXT YEAR THAT IS UNTIL THE NEXT WORLD FOR THEIR PORTION OF GOOD
UNHAPPY WOMAN EXCLAIMED ALI BABA WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO RUIN ME AND MY FAMILY IT WAS TO PRESERVE NOT TO RUIN YOU ANSWERED MORGIANA
FEED HIM WITH APRICOTS AND DEWBERRIES PURPLE GRAPES GREEN FIGS AND MULBERRIES
FOR WE ALL SAW PLAINLY THAT THE SEA WENT SO HIGH THAT THE BOAT COULD NOT ESCAPE AND THAT WE SHOULD BE INEVITABLY DROWNED
THE STREETS ALSO WERE PAVED WITH GOLD AND IN THEM WALKED MANY MEN WITH CROWNS ON THEIR HEADS PALMS IN THEIR HANDS AND GOLDEN HARPS TO SING PRAISES WITHAL
ON HER ARRIVAL ALADDIN WAS READY TO RECEIVE HER AT THE ENTRANCE AND LED HER INTO A LARGE HALL ILLUMINATED WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAX CANDLES WHERE A NOBLE FEAST WAS SERVED UP
I CONSULTED THE MOST EXPERIENCED SEAMEN UPON THE DEPTH OF THE CHANNEL WHICH THEY HAD OFTEN PLUMBED WHO TOLD ME THAT IN THE MIDDLE AT HIGH WATER IT WAS SEVENTY GLUMGLUFFS DEEP WHICH IS ABOUT SIX FEET OF EUROPEAN MEASURE
OTHERWISE I WILL GO AND INFORM AGAINST YOU AND THEN YOU WILL NOT ONLY GET NO MORE BUT WILL LOSE ALL YOU HAVE AND I SHALL HAVE A SHARE FOR MY INFORMATION ALI BABA TOLD HIM ALL HE DESIRED EVEN TO THE VERY WORDS HE WAS TO USE TO GAIN ADMISSION INTO THE CAVE
THE ANIMAL SEEMED TO STOP SOMETIMES BUT ALWAYS FLED AND BREATHED HARD AS I APPROACHED
HERE IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD INK ON BOARD WAS GREATLY SURPRISED THAT I NEVER HIT UPON A WAY OF MAKING INK OF CHARCOAL AND WATER OR OF SOMETHING ELSE AS I HAD DONE THINGS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT
IT BEING NOW THE DUTY OF THE PRINCE TO NAME THE KNIGHT WHO HAD DONE BEST HE DETERMINED ALTHOUGH CONTRARY TO THE ADVICE OF THOSE ABOUT HIM THAT THE HONOUR OF THE DAY REMAINED WITH THE BLACK KNIGHT
HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW NATIVE PRINCES WHO STILL CONTINUED TO OCCUPY THE HOME OF HIS FATHERS
PEEPING OUT THROUGH THE STRAW HE SAW FIVE ROUGH-LOOKING MEN COME IN WHO SEEMED TO BE GIPSIES AND SAILORS
I HAVE SEEN MY OPPRESSOR FALL AT HIS OWN BOARD BY THE HAND OF HIS OWN SON
HE WAS MUCH DISTRESSED AT HEARING THE PITIABLE ACCOUNT THAT WAS GIVEN TO HIM OF HIS OLD FRIEND GODFREY BERTRAM
ONE OF THEM HIT ME ON THE BACK AS I CHANCED TO STOOP AND KNOCKED ME DOWN FLAT ON MY FACE
I FOUND SOME HERBS FIT TO EAT AND HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO DISCOVER A SPRING OF EXCELLENT WATER
AND THEN STRANGE TO RELATE THE ROC COMES AND CARRIES THEM BOTH AWAY IN HER CLAWS FOR FOOD FOR HER YOUNG ONES
THIS PRINCE HAS SEVERAL MACHINES FIXED ON WHEELS FOR THE CARRIAGE OF TREES AND OTHER GREAT WEIGHTS
I LOVE YOU SHE WENT ON
I PLEASED MYSELF WITH THE DESIGN WITHOUT DETERMINING WHETHER I WAS EVER ABLE TO UNDERTAKE IT
SHOWERS OF WELL-DIRECTED ARROWS CAME POURING AGAINST EACH EMBRASURE AND OPENING IN THE PARAPETS AS WELL AS EVERY WINDOW WHERE A DEFENDER MIGHT BE SUSPECTED TO BE STATIONED
AND THUS ARMED I TRAVELLED FOR DISCOVERY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT HILL WHERE AFTER I HAD WITH GREAT LABOR AND DIFFICULTY GOT TO THE TOP I SAW MY FATE TO MY GREAT AFFLICTION--VIZ THAT I WAS IN AN ISLAND ENVIRONED EVERY WAY WITH THE SEA
AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER LOUD VOICES WERE HEARD CALLING FOR SIR REGINALD FRONT-DE-BOEUF
THOU NEEDST NOT PERPLEX THYSELF ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
THEY CLIMBED UP INTO THE ENGINE AND ADVANCING VERY SOFTLY TO MY FACE ONE OF THEM AN OFFICER IN THE GUARDS PUT THE SHARP END OF HIS HALF-PIKE A GOOD WAY UP INTO MY LEFT NOSTRIL WHICH TICKLED MY NOSE LIKE A STRAW AND MADE ME SNEEZE VIOLENTLY
THE OTHER VIZIERS AND MINISTERS OF STATE THEN RETIRED AS ALSO DID ALL THOSE WHOSE BUSINESS HAD CALLED THEM THITHER
AT SOME DISTANCE THEY SAW CASSIM'S MULES STRAGGLING ABOUT THE ROCK WITH GREAT CHESTS ON THEIR BACKS
I PITIED THE POOR SOUL
WHEN NIGHT CAME ON I WENT INTO A CAVE WHERE I THOUGHT I MIGHT REPOSE IN SAFETY
BUT THE PRINCE WHOM I SERVE AND HONOR IS MERCIFUL AND READY TO FORGIVE
IN ALL OTHER PLACES IT IS USUAL FOR RIVERS TO RUN FROM THEIR CHANNELS INTO THE SEA
THIS CLOWN HAD MET WITH PUCK WHO HAD CLAPPED AN ASS'S HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS SO THAT IT LOOKED AS IF IT GREW THERE
NOW SAID OBERON TO THIS LITTLE SPRITE FETCH ME THE FLOWER CALLED LOVE-IN-IDLENESS
OH HOW BITTER A THING IT IS TO LOOK INTO HAPPINESS THROUGH ANOTHER MAN'S EYES THEN ANSWERED ROSALIND STILL IN GANYMEDE'S DRESS AND SPEAKING WITH HIS VOICE--"IF YOU DO LOVE ROSALIND SO NEAR THE HEART THEN WHEN YOUR BROTHER MARRIES ALIENA SHALL YOU MARRY HER NOW THE NEXT DAY THE DUKE AND HIS FOLLOWERS AND ORLANDO AND OLIVER AND ALIENA WERE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER FOR THE WEDDING
I CAST MY EYES TO THE STRANDED VESSEL WHEN THE BREACH AND FROTH OF THE SEA BEING SO BIG I COULD HARDLY SEE IT IT LAY SO FAR OFF
WHEN I HAD FOR SOME TIME ENTERTAINED THEIR EXCELLENCIES TO THEIR INFINITE SATISFACTION AND SURPRISE I DESIRED THEY WOULD DO ME THE HONOR TO PRESENT MY MOST HUMBLE RESPECTS TO THE EMPEROR THEIR MASTER THE RENOWN OF WHOSE VIRTUES HAD SO JUSTLY FILLED THE WHOLE WORLD WITH ADMIRATION AND WHOSE ROYAL PERSON I RESOLVED TO ATTEND BEFORE I RETURNED TO MY OWN COUNTRY
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE DISCHARGES OF SEVERAL CANNON WERE HEARD AND AFTER AN INTERVAL A STILL LOUDER EXPLOSION AS OF A VESSEL BLOWN UP
MY SON JOHNNY NAMED SO AFTER HIS UNCLE WAS AT THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND A COWARDLY CHILD
THEN THE HEAVENLY HOST GAVE A GREAT SHOUT SAYING BLESSED ARE THEY THAT ARE CALLED TO THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB THERE CAME OUT ALSO AT THIS TIME TO MEET THEM SEVERAL OF THE KING'S TRUMPETERS CLOATHED IN WHITE AND SHINING RAIMENT WHO WITH MELODIOUS NOISES AND LOUD MADE EVEN THE HEAVENS TO ECHO WITH THEIR SOUND
THE HUSBAND WALKED FIRST NEXT TO THE DEAD BODY
COME THIS WAY FATHER SHE SAID TO HIM
BUT HAVING GOT NORTHWARD OF THAT ISLAND AND TO ABOUT FIVE DEGREES SOUTH LATITUDE THE WINDS WHICH IN THOSE SEAS ARE OBSERVED TO BLOW A CONSTANT EQUAL GALE BETWEEN THE NORTH AND WEST FROM THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER TO THE BEGINNING OF MAY ON THE 9TH OF APRIL BEGAN TO BLOW WITH MUCH GREATER VIOLENCE AND MORE WESTERLY THAN USUAL CONTINUING SO FOR TWENTY DAYS TOGETHER
MY DOG WHO WAS NOW GROWN OLD SAT ALWAYS AT MY RIGHT HAND
I WAS BORN INDEED IN YOUR DOMINIONS BUT YOUR SERVICE WAS HARD AND YOUR WAGES SUCH AS A MAN COULD NOT LIVE ON FOR THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH
CLOSE BY STOOD FOUR BLACK SLAVES WHOSE COLOUR AND AFRICAN FEATURES THEN SO LITTLE KNOWN IN ENGLAND APPALLED THE MULTITUDE WHO GAZED ON THEM AS DEMONS
THIS DONE THEY COMPASSED THEM ROUND ON EVERY SIDE
GOOD WOMAN IT IS TRUE SULTANS OUGHT TO ABIDE BY THEIR WORD AND I AM READY TO KEEP MINE BY MAKING YOUR SON HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCESS MY DAUGHTER
THE DUKE GAVE HER FOUR DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO MARRY DEMETRIUS SHE WOULD HAVE TO DIE
AS THE FEAST PROCEEDED A DISCUSSION AROSE AMONGST THE BANQUETERS AS TO WHICH KNIGHTS HAD BORNE THEM BEST IN PALESTINE AMONG THE CHAMPIONS OF THE CROSS
AND THEN PLAINLY SAW IT TO BE A REAL BOAT WHICH I SUPPOSED MIGHT BY SOME TEMPEST HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM A SHIP
IN A LOW-ARCHED AND DUSKY PASSAGE BY WHICH CEDRIC ENDEAVOURED TO WORK HIS WAY TO THE HALL HE WAS MET BY URFRIED THE OLD CRONE OF THE TOWER
FOR IT HAPPENED THAT THERE WAS THEN IN THAT PLACE ONE VAIN-HOPE A FERRY-MAN THAT WITH HIS BOAT HELPED HIM OVER
AND SHORTLY AFTER TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE DRIVER MISSED THE WAY
AS I WAS ONE DAY AT THE PORT AFTER MY RETURN THE SHIP ARRIVED IN WHICH I HAD EMBARKED AT BUSSORAH
RASPE TWO STRANGE ADVENTURES IN RUSSIA R
INSOMUCH THAT I BELIEVE I MIGHT SET IN NEAR TWENTY THOUSAND OF THEM LEAVING A PRETTY LARGE SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND MY WALL THAT I MIGHT HAVE ROOM TO SEE AN ENEMY AND THEY MIGHT HAVE NO SHELTER FROM THE YOUNG TREES IF THEY ATTEMPTED TO APPROACH MY OUTER WALL
I NEVER HEARD THAT ANY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE HAD EVER SEEN ONE
BUT AS FOR ME HOW MANY TIMES AS ALL THE WORLD VERY WELL KNOWS HAVE I DELIVERED EITHER BY POWER OR FRAUD THOSE THAT HAVE FAITHFULLY SERVED ME FROM HIM AND HIS THOUGH TAKEN BY THEM
WE GOT THE STARBOARD TACKS ABOARD WE CAST OFF OUR WEATHER BRACES AND LIFTS
BUT AS WE MADE NEARER AND NEARER THE SHORE THE LAND LOOKED MORE FRIGHTFUL THAN THE SEA
BUT MEETING A TRADE-WIND TWO DAYS AFTER I CAME ON BOARD HIM WE SAILED SOUTHWARD A LONG TIME AND COASTING NEW HOLLAND KEPT OUR COURSE WEST-SOUTHWEST AND THEN SOUTH-SOUTHWEST TILL WE DOUBLED THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE
IT WAS SOON FORCED IN WITH SLEDGEHAMMERS AND CROWS AND BEFORE LONG SOME THREE OR FOUR OF THE PRINCIPAL SMUGGLERS HURRIED TO THE APARTMENT OF BERTRAM WITH LIGHTED TORCHES AND ARMED WITH CUTLASSES AND PISTOLS
THIS IS INDEED THE JUDGMENT OF GOD SAID THE GRAND MASTER LOOKING UPWARDS
SUDDENLY WE SAW THE CAPTAIN QUIT HIS RUDDER UTTERING LOUD LAMENTATIONS
WHEN HE HAD READ WHAT THE KING OF SERENDIB WROTE TO HIM HE ASKED ME IF THAT PRINCE WERE REALLY SO RICH AND POTENT AS HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF IN HIS LETTER
HE SAID THAT AS FOR SENDING ME BOUND HIS BROTHER KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THE OTHER SO EXACTLY HIT THE MIDDLE OF THE SHIP AS TO SPLIT IT INTO PIECES
THE NEXT NIGHT SHE TALKING WITH HER HUSBAND ABOUT THEM FURTHER AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE YET ALIVE DID ADVISE HIM TO COUNSEL THEM TO MAKE AWAY THEMSELVES
THIS ATTEMPT DESERVES THAT YOU THE PRINCESS AND THE PALACE SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY REDUCED TO ASHES
THE LADY ROWENA HOWEVER HAD AT THE SAME TIME BEEN APPROACHED BY THE OLD MAN'S DAUGHTER WHO KISSING THE HEM OF HER GARMENT IMPLORED HER TO HAVE COMPASSION ON THEM
CONSIDERING ITS PROBABLE COURSE WITH GREAT ATTENTION I SAID TO MYSELF THIS RIVER WHICH RUNS THUS UNDERGROUND MUST SOMEWHERE HAVE AN ISSUE
THE INTERPRETER ANSWERED THE GOVERNOR OF THEM WOULD HAVE HIM STAY FOR HIS BEST THINGS TILL THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT YEAR
FOR AFTER THE ELEPHANTS HAD STARED UPON ME SOME TIME ONE OF THE LARGEST OF THEM PUT HIS TRUNK ROUND THE FOOT OF THE TREE PLUCKED IT UP AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND
IF HE GUESSED ARIGHT THEN PORTIA WOULD BE HIS BRIDE
BUT FURTHER TO CONFIRM ALL I HAD SAID I ENTREATED HIM TO GIVE ORDER THAT MY CABINET SHOULD BE BROUGHT OF WHICH I HAD THE KEY IN MY POCKET
THEN THE HUSBAND EMBRACING HIS KINDRED AND FRIENDS SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE PLACED ON ANOTHER BIER WITHOUT RESISTANCE WITH A POT OF WATER AND SEVEN SMALL LOAVES AND WAS LET DOWN IN THE SAME MANNER
AS EVENING CAME ON MR AND MRS BERTRAM WERE EXPECTING LITTLE HARRY TO COME HOME AND AS HE DID NOT RETURN BECAME VERY UNEASY ABOUT HIM
IN THE MEANTIME THE FESTIVITIES IN HONOR OF THE PRINCESS'S MARRIAGE WERE CONDUCTED IN THE SULTAN'S PALACE WITH GREAT MAGNIFICENCE
WHICH HOLE I SHUT AT PLEASURE WITH A BOARD THAT DREW BACKWARD AND FORWARD THROUGH A GROOVE
AND FROM THIS TIME BEGAN AN INTRIGUE BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND A JUNTO OF MINISTERS MALICIOUSLY BENT AGAINST ME WHICH BROKE OUT IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AND HAD LIKE TO HAVE ENDED IN MY UTTER DESTRUCTION
IF THEY BE DRIVEN THITHER BY A WIND FROM THE SEA THE WIND AND THE CURRENT IMPEL THEM
THIS COURSE HE FOLLOWED TILL HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WITHOUT GIVING HIS MIND TO ANY USEFUL PURSUIT OR THE LEAST REFLECTION ON WHAT WOULD BECOME OF HIM
THE PRISON IN WHICH BERTRAM NOW FOUND HIMSELF WAS A BUILDING WHICH ADJOINED THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AND BOTH WERE CLOSE BESIDE THE SEA
THERE WAS MY MAJESTY THE PRINCE AND LORD OF THE WHOLE ISLAND
BUT ALL THIS IS BY THE BY
HE SPOKE WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT AND UPBRAIDED THE GIPSY FOR KEEPING HIM WAITING SO LONG ORDERING HER WITH A CURSE TO COME AND BLESS HIS SHIP BEFORE IT SET OUT ON ITS VOYAGE
WELL TO TAKE AWAY THIS DISCOURAGEMENT I RESOLVED TO DIG INTO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND SO MAKE A DECLIVITY
I DESIRED HIS LEAVE TO GO WITH THEM THAT I MIGHT SEE THE COUNTRY AND MAKE WHAT DISCOVERIES I COULD
SO SHE WENT TO HIM AND BETRAYED HER FRIEND'S SECRET
OPPOSITE TO THIS ROYAL GALLERY WAS ANOTHER EVEN MORE GAILY DECORATED RESERVED AS THE SEAT OF HONOUR FOR THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY AND OF LOVE
AFTER THEY HAD MUSED A WHILE UPON THIS THEY SET UP TWO OR THREE GREAT SHOUTS HALLOOING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT TO TRY IF THEY COULD MAKE THEIR COMPANIONS HEAR
HE HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN THE EARTH OPENED JUST BEFORE THE MAGICIAN AND DISCOVERED A STONE WITH A BRASS RING FIXED IN IT
SO AT LENGTH THOUGH WITH GREAT RELUCTANCY I GAVE THIS ATTEMPT OVER ALSO
BUT WHEN LYSANDER WOKE HE SAW NOT HIS OWN HERMIA BUT HELENA WHO WAS WALKING THROUGH THE WOOD LOOKING FOR THE CRUEL DEMETRIUS
I SHOWED THEM THE NEW CAPTAIN HANGING AT THE YARD-ARM OF THE SHIP AND TOLD THEM THEY HAD NOTHING LESS TO EXPECT
THERE YOU SHALL ENJOY YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN THAT ARE GONE THITHER BEFORE YOU
HE DESIRED I WOULD STAND LIKE A COLOSSUS WITH MY LEGS AS FAR ASUNDER AS I CONVENIENTLY COULD
THIS HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT
AND JOHN TURNED DEADLY PALE AS HE HEARD THE WORDS FOR HE HAD BEEN PLOTTING TO SEIZE THE THRONE DURING HIS BROTHER'S ABSENCE
I WENT EVERY DAY AT A SET HOUR TO MAKE MY COURT TO THE KING AND SPENT THE REST OF MY TIME IN VIEWING THE CITY AND WHAT WAS MOST WORTHY OF NOTICE
AT LAST I SAT DOWN AND NOTWITHSTANDING MY APPREHENSIONS NOT HAVING CLOSED MY EYES DURING THE NIGHT FELL ASLEEP AFTER HAVING EATEN A LITTLE MORE OF MY PROVISIONS
I WAS TWENTY DAYS HACKING AND HEWING AT IT AT THE BOTTOM
WHEN I LEFT MR BATES I WENT DOWN TO MY FATHER
BUT THAT GATE AS IT OPENED MADE SUCH A CREAKING THAT IT WAKED GIANT DESPAIR WHO HASTILY RISING TO PURSUE HIS PRISONERS FELT HIS LIMBS TO FAIL FOR HIS FITS TOOK HIM AGAIN SO THAT HE COULD BY NO MEANS GO AFTER THEM
YET THIS WILL I SAY AND LOUDLY THAT WERE HE IN ENGLAND I WOULD GLADLY MEET HIM IN THIS WEEK'S TOURNAMENT MOUNTED AND ARMED AS I NOW AM IF IVANHOE EVER RETURNS FROM PALESTINE I WILL BE HIS SURETY THAT HE MEETS YOU REPLIED THE PALMER
I ASSURED HIM I WAS WELL REFRESHED WITH HIS GOOD ENTERTAINMENT AND COMPANY AND AS MUCH IN MY SENSES AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
HE WAS ASSURED THAT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE BUT THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF RESCUING HER FROM THE CLUTCHES OF BOIS-GUILBERT EXCEPT BY THE PAYMENT OF A RANSOM OF SIX HUNDRED CROWNS
LOOKED AT THE WOUND THE BULLET HAD MADE WHICH IT SEEMS WAS JUST IN HIS BREAST WHERE IT HAD MADE A HOLE AND NO GREAT QUANTITY OF BLOOD HAD FOLLOWED
SECONDLY WHEN I CAME TO MEASURE THE MARK WITH MY OWN FOOT I FOUND MY FOOT NOT SO LARGE BY A GREAT DEAL
AND TWO SMALL ISLANDS LESS THAN THIS WHICH LAY ABOUT THREE LEAGUES TO THE WEST
I LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS WHICH WAS VERY SHORT AND SOFT WHERE I SLEPT SOUNDER THAN EVER I REMEMBERED TO HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE AND AS I RECKONED ABOUT NINE HOURS
I WALKED ABOUT ON THE SHORE LIFTING UP MY HANDS AND MY WHOLE BEING AS I MAY SAY WRAPPED UP IN A CONTEMPLATION OF MY DELIVERANCE
TIRED I ALIGHTED AND FASTENED MY HORSE TO SOMETHING LIKE A POINTED STUMP OF A TREE WHICH APPEARED ABOVE THE SNOW
BUT HOW CAMEST THOU IN THIS CONDITION
IT'S MEG MERRILIES THE GIPSY AS SURE AS I'M A SINNER SAID MR BERTRAM
THE GALLANT YOUNG WARRIOR WHO AS HE FELL FAINTING TO THE GROUND SEEMED TO BE ABANDONED BY ALL THE WORLD HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED FROM THE LISTS AT THE ENTREATY OF REBECCA TO THE HOUSE AT ASHBY THEN OCCUPIED BY ISAAC OF YORK WHERE HIS WOUNDS WERE DRESSED AND TENDED BY THE JEWISH MAIDEN HERSELF
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN WHY DOTH THIS MAN THUS TREMBLE
3
PRODUCING A KEY FROM HER POCKET THE GIPSY OPENED THE DOOR AND LED THE WAY IN
BUT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING ME HE MADE A SIGN FOR ME TO TAKE HIM UPON MY BACK AND CARRY HIM OVER THE BROOK
THOU WAST ALSO ALMOST PERSUADED TO GO BACK AT THE SIGHT OF THE LIONS
SHE HATH LONG DRUNKEN OF THIS CUP AND ITS BITTERNESS IS NOW SWEETENED TO SEE THAT THOU DOST PARTAKE IT DETESTABLE FURY EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN
I CARRIED WITH ME WOOD OF ALOES SANDALS CAMPHIRE NUTMEGS CLOVES PEPPER AND GINGER
AS SOON AS THEY CAME WITHIN CALL OF THE SHIP HE MADE ROBINSON HAIL THEM AND TELL THEM THEY HAD BROUGHT OFF THE MEN AND THE BOAT BUT THAT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY HAD FOUND THEM AND THE LIKE HOLDING THEM IN A CHAT TILL THEY CAME TO THE SHIP'S SIDE
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE ADVANCED INTO THE ISLAND I SAW AN OLD MAN WHO APPEARED VERY WEAK AND INFIRM
BRING THEM BOTH HITHER TO ME IMMEDIATELY THEY RETIRE TO THEIR BEDCHAMBER MASTER REPLIED THE GENIE I OBEY YOU ALADDIN SUPPED WITH HIS MOTHER AS WAS THEIR WONT AND THEN WENT TO HIS OWN APARTMENT AND SAT UP TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THE GENIE ACCORDING TO HIS COMMANDS
THE ROBBER FINDING HE COULD DISCOVER NO MORE FROM BABA MUSTAPHA THANKED HIM FOR THE TROUBLE HE HAD TAKEN AND LEFT HIM TO GO BACK TO HIS STALL WHILE HE RETURNED TO THE FOREST PERSUADED THAT HE SHOULD BE VERY WELL RECEIVED
THIS DEMAND IS A MERE TRIFLE AND WILL PROVE NO BAR TO MY MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCESS
THE NAME OF IVANHOE WAS NO SOONER PRONOUNCED THAN IT FLEW FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH THROUGHOUT THE VAST ASSEMBLY
I LAY SOME TIME IN A SITUATION WHICH NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE EXPECTING TO FEEL HIS TEETH OR TALONS IN SOME PART OF ME EVERY MOMENT
IT SWALLOWED UP ONE OF MY COMRADES NOTWITHSTANDING HIS LOUD CRIES AND THE EFFORTS HE MADE TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM IT
FOR THERE CAME PEOPLE FROM HIS SHIP WHO KNEW ME PAID ME GREAT COMPLIMENTS AND EXPRESSED MUCH JOY AT SEEING ME ALIVE
THE INTERPRETER ANSWERED THIS IS CHRIST WHO CONTINUALLY WITH THE OIL OF HIS GRACE MAINTAINS THE WORK ALREADY BEGUN IN THE HEART
I WALKED ABOUT A FURLONG FROM THE SHORE TO SEE IF I COULD FIND ANY FRESH WATER TO DRINK WHICH I DID TO MY GREAT JOY
IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR ME THAT THESE PEOPLE DID NOT INSPECT THE PLACE WHERE THEY FOUND ME BUT WITHOUT HESITATION TOOK ME ON BOARD
THE NIMBLEST GOT INTO THE SLOOP OTHERS BETOOK THEMSELVES TO SWIMMING
COME PREPARE TARRY A LITTLE
AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS MY DUTY ALSO TO HOPE IN HIM PRAY TO HIM AND QUIETLY TO ATTEND TO THE DICTATES AND DIRECTIONS OF HIS DAILY PROVIDENCE
MY EMILE SHALL READ THIS BOOK BEFORE ANY OTHER
AND THE FOUR PARALLEL STICKS RISING ABOUT FIVE INCHES HIGHER THAN THE HANDKERCHIEF SERVED AS LEDGES ON EACH SIDE
AT LENGTH THEY CAME UP TO THE BOAT
AND TWO CATS ONE ON ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND ONE ON THE OTHER EXPECTING NOW AND THEN A BIT FROM MY HAND AS A MARK OF ESPECIAL FAVOR
SIR IS IT NOT TIME FOR ME TO GO ON MY WAY NOW
WELL THEN SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN I WILL CARRY YOU WITH ME TO-MORROW CLOTHE YOU AS HANDSOMELY AS THE BEST MERCHANTS IN THE CITY AND AFTERWARD WE WILL OPEN A SHOP AS I MENTIONED THE WIDOW AFTER HIS PROMISES OF KINDNESS TO HER SON NO LONGER DOUBTED THAT THE MAGICIAN WAS HER HUSBAND'S BROTHER
WHEN THE FUNERAL TRAIN HAD PASSED OUT OF SIGHT LOCKSLEY ADDRESSED THE BLACK KNIGHT AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY REQUEST TO MAKE AS HIS REWARD FOR THE GALLANTRY HE HAD DISPLAYED
AT LAST AS IT IS NATURAL FOR A MAN I WAS DESIROUS TO SEE MY NATIVE COUNTRY AGAIN AND TO EMBRACE MY DEAR BROTHER
BUT I HAD NO CONCERN IN ITS REMOVAL
HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL OF THE RELENTLESS PERSECUTION TO WHICH HIS KINDRED WERE SUBJECTED AT THIS PERIOD AND HOW UPON THE SLIGHTEST AND MOST UNREASONABLE PRETENCES THEIR PERSONS AND THEIR PROPERTY WERE EXPOSED TO EVERY TURN OF POPULAR FURY
BUT WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET'S TRY TO GO BACK AGAIN
TO-DAY WE DESIRE WHAT TO-MORROW WE FEAR NAY EVEN TREMBLE AT THE APPREHENSIONS OF
HE IS OF YOUR OWN FAITH
REBECCA LISTENED TO HIS WORDS AND THEN WITH SCORN REFUSED HIS OFFER
HE ACTED EVERY PART OF AN ORATOR AND I COULD OBSERVE MANY PERIODS OF THREATENINGS AND OTHERS OF PROMISES PITY ARID KINDNESS
AS TO OURSELVES IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO ENJOY ANY REST SO THAT WE PASSED THE NIGHT IN THE MOST PAINFUL APPREHENSION THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
ONE MORNING AS I LOOKED FOR THE ELEPHANTS I PERCEIVED WITH EXTREME AMAZEMENT THAT INSTEAD OF PASSING BY ME ACROSS THE FOREST AS USUAL THEY STOPPED AND CAME TO ME WITH A HORRIBLE NOISE IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THE PLAIN WAS COVERED AND SHOOK UNDER THEM
AFTER THESE CEREMONIES WERE PAST AND AFTER ALL HIS GOOD THINGS WERE BROUGHT INTO MY LITTLE APARTMENT WE BEGAN TO CONSULT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH THE PRISONERS WE HAD
FOR MY PART SAID I THERE SEEMS TO BE BUT ONE THING AMISS IN ALL THE PROSPECT OF IT WHAT IS THAT SAYS HE
I ANSWERED IT WAS VERY TRUE
AND SO IT DID
AS YOU ARE SOON TO BE A MERCHANT IT IS PROPER YOU SHOULD FREQUENT THESE SHOPS AND BE ACQUAINTED WITH THEM HE THEN SHOWED HIM THE LARGEST AND FINEST MOSQUES CARRIED HIM TO THE KHANS OR INNS WHERE THE MERCHANTS AND TRAVELLERS LODGED AND AFTERWARD TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE WHERE HE HAD FREE ACCESS
AT THIS THEY TREMBLED GREATLY AND I THINK THAT CHRISTIAN FELL INTO A SWOON
AND BROWN FELT A STRANGE LONGING AS HE LOOKED AT IT TO BE PUT ASHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINING IT MORE CLOSELY
I ORDERED HIM TO SET ME DOWN AND LIFTING UP ONE OF MY SASHES CAST MANY A WISTFUL MELANCHOLY LOOK TOWARD THE SEA
WHILE I WAS THUS LOOKING ON THEM I PERCEIVED BY MY PERSPECTIVE TWO MISERABLE WRETCHES DRAGGED FROM THE BOATS WHERE IT SEEMS THEY WERE LAID BY AND WERE NOW BROUGHT OUT FOR THE SLAUGHTER
THEN TO DEMOLISH MY BOWER AND TENT THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SEE ANY VESTIGES OF HABITATION AND BE PROMPTED TO LOOK FARTHER IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE PERSONS INHABITING
HOLY WOMAN SAID ONE OF THE SLAVES THE PRINCESS WANTS TO SEE YOU AND HAS SENT US FOR YOU THE PRINCESS DOES ME TOO GREAT AN HONOR REPLIED THE FALSE FATIMA
I CONCEALED NOTHING FROM THE KING
I DESIRE YOU ONLY TO TELL ME IF YOU KNOW WHERE THE OLD LAMP NOW IS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CARRIES IT CAREFULLY WRAPT UP IN HIS BOSOM SAID THE PRINCESS
SHE WENT HOME AGAIN AND WAITED PATIENTLY TILL MIDNIGHT
MEANWHILE REBECCA GIDDY AND ALMOST SENSELESS AT THE RAPID CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WAS LOCKED IN THE ARMS OF HER AGED FATHER
I STOOD LIKE ONE THUNDERSTRUCK OR AS IF I HAD SEEN AN APPARITION
AFTER I HAD SOLACED MY MIND WITH THE COMFORTABLE PART OF MY CONDITION I BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND ME TO SEE WHAT KIND OF PLACE I WAS IN AND WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE DONE
THAT PROVERB A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH IS OF MORE AUTHORITY WITH THEM THAN ARE ALL THE DIVINE TESTIMONIES OF THE GOOD OF THE WORLD TO COME
MARKEST THOU THE SMOULDERING AND SUFFOCATING VAPOUR WHICH ALREADY EDDIES IN SABLE FOLDS THROUGH THE CHAMBER
OUT OF THE MOUTH OF WHICH THERE CAME IN AN ABUNDANT MANNER SMOKE AND COALS OF FIRE WITH HIDEOUS NOISES
YE HAVE RIVEN THE ROOF OFF SEVEN COTTAR HOUSES--LOOK IF YOUR OWN ROOF-TREE STAND THE FASTER
YOUR WHOLE FAIRY KINGDOM BUYS NOT THAT BOY FROM ME
ONE WHOM HE TOOK TO BE THEIR CAPTAIN CAME UNDER THE TREE IN WHICH ALI BABA WAS CONCEALED
ALAS SAID SHE TAKING IT FROM THE APOTHECARY I AM AFRAID THAT THIS REMEDY WILL HAVE NO BETTER EFFECT THAN THE LOZENGES
SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE KING RICHARD HIMSELF
I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT AND RETURN IT WITH THANKS AS SOON AS ALI BABA'S WIFE WAS GONE CASSIM'S WIFE LOOKED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE AND WAS IN INEXPRESSIBLE SURPRISE TO FIND A PIECE OF GOLD STICKING TO IT
BUT THAT IF THEY ATTEMPTED THEIR ESCAPE THEY SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH WITHOUT MERCY
LOOK HERE COMES THE DUKE WITH HIS EYES FULL OF ANGER SAID CELIA
THAT THE SAID MAN-MOUNTAIN SHALL AT HIS TIMES OF LEISURE BE AIDING AND ASSISTING TO OUR WORKMEN IN HELPING TO RAISE CERTAIN GREAT STONES TOWARDS COVERING THE WALL OF THE PRINCIPAL PARK AND OTHER OUR ROYAL BUILDINGS
THESE SAID HE WERE PILGRIMS AS YOU ARE ONCE AND THEY TRESPASSED IN MY GROUNDS AS YOU HAVE DONE
SUGGESTING TO MYSELF THAT IF I COULD BUT TURN HER DOWN I MIGHT REPAIR THE DAMAGE SHE HAD RECEIVED AND SHE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD BOAT AND I MIGHT GO TO SEA IN HER VERY EASILY
BUT CHILD ADDED HE SOFTENING DO NOT BE AFRAID
AND WHEN I OFFERED TO STRUGGLE HE SQUEEZED ME SO HARD THAT I THOUGHT IT MORE PRUDENT TO SUBMIT
THERE COULD BE NO OTHER SUCH IN THIS PALACE WHERE EVERY UTENSIL WAS GOLD OR SILVER
I INTREATED HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY TO GIVE ORDERS IT MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE DESCRIBING TO HIM THE USE AND THE NATURE OF IT
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AT SO FORTUNATE A TIME
I HAD BEEN LONG AFRAID OF THIS RESOLUTION AND THEREFORE CONCEALED FROM HER SOME LITTLE UNLUCKY ADVENTURES THAT HAPPENED IN THOSE TIMES WHEN I WAS LEFT BY MYSELF
HE DID NOT STAY LONG
YES ANSWERED ALADDIN
IN THE MEANTIME HE HIMSELF MADE HIS WAY TO A CAVE BY THE SEASHORE NEAR THE POINT OF WARROCH WHERE HE HAD ARRANGED WITH HATTERAICK TO MEET HIM THE DAY AFTER HIS ESCAPE
THERE IS NOT YOUR FELLOW IN THE WORLD
THEY FOUND BY MY EATING THAT A SMALL QUANTITY WOULD NOT SUFFICE ME AND BEING A MOST INGENIOUS PEOPLE THEY FLUNG UP WITH GREAT DEXTERITY ONE OF THEIR LARGEST HOGSHEADS THEN ROLLED IT TOWARDS MY HAND AND BEAT OUT THE TOP
I THEREFORE SETTLED MY AFFAIRS AND PROVIDED A STOCK OF GOODS FIT FOR THE TRAFFIC I DESIGNED TO ENGAGE IN
AND THE GIPSY ANSWERED
THE DAY OF EVICTION CAME AT LENGTH AND A LARGE BODY OF MEN UNDER THE DIRECTION OF FRANK KENNEDY A CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER MADE THEIR WAY TO THE MISERABLE VILLAGE AND ON THE GIPSIES REFUSING TO LEAVE PEACEABLY PROCEEDED TO UNROOF THEIR COTTAGES AND PULL DOWN THE WRETCHED DOORS AND WINDOWS
THE INTERPRETER SHOWS CHRISTIAN MANY EXCELLENT THINGS BY JOHN BUNYAN CHRISTIAN WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF THE INTERPRETER WHERE HE KNOCKED OVER AND OVER
WEARING THE DRAWERS WAS VERY AWKWARD TO HIM AND THE SLEEVES OF THE WAISTCOAT GALLED HIS SHOULDERS AND THE INSIDE OF HIS ARMS
AND SINCE WE HAVE HONESTLY COME BY IT LET US MAKE A PROFITABLE USE OF IT WITHOUT MAKING ANY GREAT SHOW AND EXCITING THE ENVY AND JEALOUSY OF OUR NEIGHBORS
ACCORDINGLY I LET MYSELF DOWN INTO THE WATER AND SWAM ACROSS THE CHANNEL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE SHIP AND THE SANDS AND EVEN THAT WITH DIFFICULTY ENOUGH PARTLY WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE THINGS I HAD ABOUT ME AND PARTLY THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WATER
THEN TERRIBLE THOUGHTS RACKED MY IMAGINATION ABOUT THEIR HAVING FOUND OUT MY BOAT AND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE HERE
AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE TREASURER AND THE REST OF THE CABAL A PERSON OF QUALITY WAS DISPATCHED WITH THE COPY OF THE ARTICLES AGAINST ME
KING RICHARD WAS ALSO GONE AND NO ONE KNEW WHITHER
IT MIGHT HAVE PLEASED FORTUNE TO HAVE LET THE LILLIPUTIANS FIND SOME NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE AS DIMINUTIVE WITH RESPECT TO THEM AS THEY WERE TO ME
SON SAID HE TO-MORROW BEING FRIDAY WHICH IS A DAY THAT THE SHOPS OF SUCH GREAT MERCHANTS AS COGIA HOUSSAIN AND YOURSELF ARE SHUT GET HIM TO ACCOMPANY YOU AND AS YOU PASS BY MY DOOR CALL IN
BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE PLACE FIRST IT APPEARED EVIDENTLY TO ME THAT WHEN I LAID UP MY BOAT I COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE ON SHORE ANYWHERE THEREABOUTS
BUT BEFORE THIS THEY HAD DAUBED MY FACE AND BOTH MY HANDS WITH A SORT OF OINTMENT VERY PLEASANT TO THE SMELL WHICH IN A FEW MINUTES REMOVED ALL THE SMART OF THEIR ARROWS
THE GUIDE WAS SO CONFOUNDED THAT HE KNEW NOT WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE BUT STILL MORE PUZZLED WHEN HE AND THE CAPTAIN SAW FIVE OR SIX HOUSES SIMILARLY MARKED
I GAVE A GREAT DEAL TO THE POOR AND BOUGHT ANOTHER CONSIDERABLE ESTATE IN ADDITION TO WHAT I HAD ALREADY
THIS PERSON WAS SINDBAD
THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN A CIRCLE ABOUT ME THE BETTER TO OBSERVE MY MOTIONS
I GAVE THE BLACK-BROWED GIRL TO BE A HANDMAIDEN TO SIR BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT TO DO AS IT MIGHT PLEASE HIM WITH HER
HE HATH I BELIEVE SURMOUNTED THE PERSECUTION OF HIS ENEMIES IN PALESTINE AND IS ON THE EVE OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND THE LADY ROWENA SIGHED DEEPLY
HARK
AND AT LAST BROUGHT HIM TO HIS OWN KHAN WHERE MEETING WITH SOME MERCHANTS HE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH SINCE HIS ARRIVAL HE GAVE THEM A TREAT TO MAKE THEM AND HIS PRETENDED NEPHEW ACQUAINTED
ON THE SECOND MORNING AFTER THIS HAPPY BRIDAL REBECCA WAS SHOWN INTO THE APARTMENT OF THE LADY OF IVANHOE
IT IS BECAUSE THE BOOKS REPRESENTED IN THIS VOLUME HAVE BEEN DOING JUST THAT FOR MANY YEARS THAT THEY HAVE BECOME SO PRIZED
BUT MY WIFE PROTESTED I SHOULD NEVER GO TO SEA ANY MORE
THAT HE MIGHT HANG THEM ALL THERE IF HE PLEASED
AS I APPROACHED I THOUGHT IT TO BE A WHITE DOME OF A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT AND EXTENT
AFTER HE HAD PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL DEGREES OF HEAT HE CAME OUT QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN FROM WHAT HE WAS BEFORE
THIS CHARMING MELODY AND THE SMELL OF SEVERAL SORTS OF SAVORY DISHES MADE THE PORTER CONCLUDE THERE WAS A FEAST WITH GREAT REJOICINGS WITHIN
AND THE EMPEROR WAS SO MUCH DELIGHTED THAT HE ORDERED THIS ENTERTAINMENT TO BE REPEATED SEVERAL DAYS AND ONCE WAS PLEASED TO BE LIFTED UP AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND
MY BOX BY THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY THE GOODS THAT WERE IN IT AND THE BROAD PLATES OF IRON FIXED FOR STRENGTH AT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE TOP AND BOTTOM FLOATED ABOUT FIVE FEET DEEP IN WATER
WE ASKED HIM THE REASON
THIS BODY CONSISTED OF THREE THOUSAND FOOT AND A THOUSAND HORSE
WHAT FIEND PROMPTED THAT GUESS SAID HE HASTILY
HIS BROTHER WENT INTO THE FOREST OF ARDEN WHERE HE LIVED THE LIFE OF A BOLD FORESTER AS ROBIN HOOD DID IN SHERWOOD FOREST IN MERRY ENGLAND
THERE WANTS BUT ONE THING WHAT IS THAT GOOD MOTHER DEMANDED THE PRINCESS
THE SCROLL THE SCROLL WAS ALL THAT BOIS-GUILBERT UTTERED IN REPLY LOOKING TO REBECCA
HIS LOVE FOR HER CHANGED TO HATE
BUT YET LET US CONSIDER THE LORD OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH WE ARE GOING HATH SAID THOU SHALT DO NO MURDER NO NOT TO ANOTHER MAN'S PERSON
IF WE HAVE SUCH ILL LUCK AT OUR FIRST SETTING OUT WHAT MAY WE EXPECT TWIXT THIS AND OUR JOURNEY'S END
HERE SINDBAD COMMANDED ANOTHER HUNDRED SEQUINS TO BE PAID TO HINDBAD AND BEGGED HIS RETURN ON THE MORROW TO HEAR HIS SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE
I MADE ALL THE SAIL I COULD AND IN HALF AN HOUR SHE SPIED ME THEN HUNG OUT HER ANCIENT AND DISCHARGED A GUN
THERE SAID THEY IS THE MOUNT SION THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM THE INNUMERABLE COMPANY OF ANGELS AND THE SPIRITS OF JUST MEN MADE PERFECT
AND HAVING NO MORE OCCASION FOR HIS LAMPS OR BASKET SET ALL DOWN IN A SPOT WHERE NOBODY SAW HIM
MOTHER SAID HE HAVE I AN UNCLE NO CHILD REPLIED HIS MOTHER YOU HAVE NO UNCLE BY YOUR FATHER'S SIDE OR MINE I AM JUST NOW COME SAID ALADDIN FROM A MAN WHO SAYS HE IS MY UNCLE AND MY FATHER'S BROTHER
THE CAPTAIN HAVING BEEN AT TONQUIN WAS IN HIS RETURN TO ENGLAND DRIVEN NORTHEASTWARD TO THE LATITUDE OF 44 DEGREES AND LONGITUDE OF 143
FOR WHEN I AWAKED IT WAS JUST DAYLIGHT
WE SET SAIL FROM BRISTOL MAY 4 1699 AND OUR VOYAGE AT FIRST WAS VERY PROSPEROUS
WHEN I HAD DONE GLUMDALCLITCH ALWAYS CARRIED BACK MY BOAT INTO HER CLOSET AND HUNG IT ON A NAIL TO DRY
HE ASSURED THE CAPTAIN WITH AN OATH THAT HE HAD MARKED BUT ONE AND COULD NOT TELL WHO HAD CHALKED THE REST SO THAT HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH THE HOUSE WHICH THE COBBLER HAD STOPPED AT
HE LED THE CAPTAIN INTO THE STREET WHERE HE HAD MARKED ALI BABA'S RESIDENCE
HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK SHIP FOR CUMBERLAND
FOR THIS PURPOSE HE RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND TOOK A LODGING IN A KHAN AND DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A MERCHANT IN SILKS
NAY YOU MAY ADD ANOTHER TO WIT THE GLORY OF THE NEXT WORLD WILL NEVER WEAR OUT
THEN EACH OF THEM TOOK OFF HIS SADDLE-BAG WHICH SEEMED TO ALI BABA TO BE FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER FROM ITS WEIGHT
HE STOPPED HIS MULES ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIM AND SAID I HAVE BROUGHT SOME OIL A GREAT WAY TO SELL AT TO-MORROW'S MARKET
PRAY TO GOD TO DELIVER US FROM THIS PERIL
AND AS THE DOOR OPENED A TALL WOMAN FULL SIX FEET HIGH WITH WEATHER-BEATEN FEATURES AND HAIR AS BLACK AS MIDNIGHT STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
YOU ATE UP ALL THE PROVISIONS I HAD IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY
THESE I PLANTED LIKE MY CANNON AND FITTED THEM INTO FRAMES THAT HELD THEM LIKE A CARRIAGE SO THAT I COULD FIRE ALL THE SEVEN GUNS IN TWO MINUTES TIME
ADMIT THEM THE NOBLE GUESTS WERE USHERED IN SHORTLY AFTER ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR ATTENDANTS AND CEDRIC BADE THEM WELCOME TO HIS HALL
CEDRIC THE SAXON HE SAID THE FRIEND OF THE RIGHTS OF ENGLISHMEN SHALL NOT WANT ENGLISH HANDS TO HELP HIM IN THIS EXTREMITY
THE EMPEROR HOLDS A STICK IN HIS HANDS BOTH ENDS PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON WHILE THE CANDIDATES ADVANCING ONE BY ONE SOMETIMES LEAP OVER THE STICK SOMETIMES CREEP UNDER IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SEVERAL TIMES ACCORDING AS THE STICK IS ADVANCED OR DEPRESSED
SCARCELY HAD THEY FINISHED THEIR REPAST WHEN THERE APPEARED IN THE AIR AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TWO GREAT CLOUDS
I NOW PERCEIVED I WAS FALLEN INTO THE SEA
THE ANSWER WHICH WAS RETURNED FROM THE CASTLE TO THIS MISSIVE ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRISONERS WOULD NOT BE GIVEN UP
I WAS IN THE UTMOST ASTONISHMENT AND ROARED SO LOUD THAT THEY ALL RAN BACK IN A FRIGHT
THE ANTAGONIST OF GRANTMESNIL BROKE HIS SPEAR
HE HIMSELF SET THEM THE EXAMPLE AND THEY ALL RETURNED AS THEY HAD COME
THE LAST OF THESE VOYAGES NOT PROVING VERY FORTUNATE I GREW WEARY OF THE SEA AND INTENDED TO STAY AT HOME WITH MY WIFE AND FAMILY
WHEREIN I HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY STUDIOUS OF TRUTH WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY ORNAMENTS OF LEARNING OR OF STYLE
BUT OTHERS WHO WERE MY SECRET ENEMIES COULD NOT FORBEAR SOME EXPRESSIONS WHICH BY A SIDE-WIND REFLECTED ON ME
FOR THE WIND ROSE VERY HASTILY AND BEFORE IT WAS QUITE HIGH WATER IT BLEW A STORM
THOSE THEREFORE WERE CARRIED IN TO THE KING WHO WHEN HE HAD READ THEM SAID WHERE ARE THE MEN
HE DESCENDED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS WITH A DESIGN TO GET INTO THE PALACE BUT THE DOOR WHICH WAS OPENED BEFORE BY ENCHANTMENT WAS NOW SHUT BY THE SAME MEANS
WELL I BEGAN THIS WORK
I WILL GO AND SELL IT AND BUY BREAD AND SOMETHING FOR OUR DINNER MOTHER REPLIED ALADDIN KEEP YOUR COTTON FOR ANOTHER TIME AND GIVE ME THE LAMP I BROUGHT HOME WITH ME YESTERDAY
AND WITH THAT THE ROCKS RENT THE GRAVES OPENED AND THE DEAD THAT WERE THEREIN CAME FORTH
MANNERING WISHED HIM GOOD-DAY SHORTLY AFTER AND AS HE SAW HIM EMBARKING IN A SMALL BOAT HE WAS CONVINCED FROM HIS CONVERSATION AND APPEARANCE THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS A SMUGGLER
AFTER HE HAD RESORTED TO A LONG COURSE OF MAGIC CEREMONIES AND HAD FORMED A HOROSCOPE BY WHICH TO ASCERTAIN ALADDIN'S FATE WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND THE APPEARANCES TO DECLARE THAT ALADDIN INSTEAD OF DYING IN THE CAVE HAD MADE HIS ESCAPE AND WAS LIVING IN ROYAL SPLENDOR BY THE AID OF THE GENIE OF THE WONDERFUL LAMP
FOR THE MOMENT I TURNED ABOUT I FOUND A LARGE CROCODILE WITH HIS MOUTH EXTENDED ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE ME
AFTER SHE HAD DANCED SEVERAL DANCES WITH MUCH GRACE SHE DREW THE PONIARD AND HOLDING IT IN HER HAND BEGAN A DANCE IN WHICH SHE OUTDID HERSELF BY THE MANY DIFFERENT FIGURES LIGHT MOVEMENTS AND THE SURPRISING LEAPS AND WONDERFUL EXERTIONS WITH WHICH SHE ACCOMPANIED IT
WE GATHERED UP THE COCOANUTS AND FROM TIME TO TIME THREW STONES TO PROVOKE THE APES
DURING THE TIME THE UNHAPPY JEW WAS UNDERGOING HIS TERRIBLE ORDEAL IN THE GLOOMY DUNGEON HIS DAUGHTER REBECCA IN HER LONELY TURRET HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO ATTENTIONS NO LESS UNPLEASANT
I EXCHANGED MY COCOA IN THOSE TWO ISLANDS FOR PEPPER AND WOOD OF ALOES AND WENT WITH OTHER MERCHANTS A-PEARL-FISHING I HIRED DIVERS WHO BROUGHT ME UP SOME THAT WERE VERY LARGE AND PURE
AND NOW SAID GLOSSIN TO HIMSELF TO FIND DIRCK HATTERAICK AND HIS PEOPLE--TO GET THE GUARD SENT OFF--AND THEN FOR THE GRAND CAST OF THE DICE AND SO SAYING HE HASTENED AWAY TO COMPLETE WITH THE SMUGGLER CAPTAIN THE VILLAINOUS PLAN ON WHICH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY AGREED
BUT HE WAS ASKED BY THE MEN THAT LOOKED OVER THE TOP OF THE GATE WHENCE CAME YOU
AND IN A WORD TO SEPARATE EVERYTHING AT LARGE INTO THEIR PLACES THAT I MIGHT COME EASILY AT THEM
AND HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE A MAN SHOULD COME THERE
SO SHE ASKED HIM WHAT THEY WERE WHENCE THEY CAME AND WHITHER THEY WERE BOUND
EVERY TIME HE WENT OUT HE CAUSED TWO SLAVES WHO WALKED BY THE SIDE OF HIS HORSE TO THROW HANDFULS OF MONEY AMONG THE PEOPLE AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE STREETS AND SQUARES
AND FIRST AMONG THEM ALL PRINCE FERDINAND LEAPED INTO THE SEA AND AS HIS FATHER THOUGHT IN HIS GRIEF WAS DROWNED
THE JEW WAS SOMEWHAT CONFOUNDED AT THIS PLAIN DEALING
AND INDEED THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED THEMSELVES ALSO BY THE TIME THEY CAME BACK TO US
THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT WHILE WE WERE AT SUPPER HE OBSERVED ME TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING WITH A SORT OF WONDER AND THAT I OFTEN SEEMED HARDLY ABLE TO CONTAIN MY LAUGHTER WHICH HE KNEW NOT WELL HOW TO TAKE BUT IMPUTED IT TO SOME DISORDER IN MY BRAIN
ON HEARING OF THESE BRAVE DEEDS FROM THE LIPS OF MORGIANA ALI BABA SAID TO HER GOD BY YOUR MEANS HAS DELIVERED ME FROM THE SNARES THESE ROBBERS LAID FOR MY DESTRUCTION
I HAVE CRUCIFIED HIM TO MYSELF AFRESH I HAVE DESPISED HIS PERSON I HAVE DESPISED HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS I HAVE COUNTED HIS BLOOD AN UNHOLY THING
AND ON REMOVING THE HANDKERCHIEF WITH WHICH SHE HAD IT BOUNDA IT WAS FOUND TO BE MARKED WITH THE NAME OF HARRY BERTRAM
HE RECEIVED IT ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND AND THEN APPLIED IT CLOSE TO HIS EYE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS AND AFTERWARD TURNED IT SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE POINT OF A PIN WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF HIS SLEEVE BUT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
MY REMAINING STOCK I CARRIED WITH ME PART IN MONEY AND PART IN GOODS IN HOPES TO IMPROVE MY FORTUNES
THEN THEY ASKED HIM FOR HIS CERTIFICATE THAT THEY MIGHT GO IN AND SHEW IT TO THE KING
I KNEW YOU AT FIRST SIGHT
HE WAITS FOR YOU WITH IMPATIENCE ALADDIN ENRAPTURED WITH THIS NEWS MADE HIS MOTHER VERY LITTLE REPLY BUT RETIRED TO HIS CHAMBER
HERE ARE ISAAC THE JEW AND REBECCA HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER
THE CHAMPIONS ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER WITH THE UTMOST FURY AND WITH ALTERNATE SUCCESS
SHE SAT VERY COMPOSED AND UNCONCERNED AND LOOKED FULL IN MY FACE AS IF SHE HAD A MIND TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH ME
LET THERE BE AN INNER AND OUTER COURT IN FRONT OF THE PALACE AND A SPACIOUS GARDEN
SOME OF WHICH I SHALL VENTURE TO RELATE
HE DID SO AND TOLD THEM THAT A SHEPHERD'S FLOCKS AND HOUSE WERE TO BE SOLD
UPON THIS I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND WENT ABOARD THE SAME SHIP AFTER I HAD EXCHANGED MY GOODS FOR THE COMMODITIES OF THAT COUNTRY
HE DRANK IT OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO THE PRINCESS TO THE VERY LAST DROP WHEN HE FELL BACKWARD LIFELESS ON THE SOFA
BUT ONE AMONG THE COURTIERS WITH ANTONIO WAS TRUE TO HIS RIGHTFUL MASTER PROSPERO
NOR WOULD I BREAK IT FOR TEN JEWS AND JEWESSES TO BOOT THE YELL WHICH ISAAC RAISED AT THIS UNFEELING COMMUNICATION MADE THE VAULT RING
NOR IS IT AT ALL TO BE WONDERED AT WHEN I INFORM YOU FROM WHENCE IT PROCEEDED
8TH
AND SOME WITH NO MORE TOOLS THAN AN ADZE AND A HATCHET WHICH PERHAPS WERE NEVER MADE THAT WAY BEFORE AND THAT WITH INFINITE LABOR
ARE YE NOT AFRAID THAT THE WALLS OF MY FATHER'S DWELLING SHOULD FALL AND CRUSH YE LIMB AND BONE
AND THEY MIGHT SEE BY AND BY THAT THEIR NEW CAPTAIN HAD RECEIVED THE REWARD OF HIS VILLANY AND THAT THEY WOULD SEE HIM HANGING AT THE YARD-ARM
SO WHEN MORNING WAS COME HE GOES TO THEM IN A SURLY MANNER AS BEFORE AND PERCEIVING THEM TO BE VERY SORE WITH THE STRIPES THAT HE HAD GIVEN THEM THE DAY BEFORE HE TOLD THEM THAT SINCE THEY WERE NEVER LIKE TO COME OUT OF THAT PLACE THEIR ONLY WAY WOULD BE FORTHWITH TO MAKE AN END OF THEMSELVES EITHER WITH KNIFE HALTER OR POISON
IN A WORD HE CLOTHED ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT
I TOOK LEAVE OF MY WIFE AND BOY AND GIRL WITH TEARS ON BOTH SIDES AND WENT ON BOARD THE ADVENTURE A MERCHANT SHIP OF THREE HUNDRED TONS BOUND FOR SURAT CAPTAIN JOHN NICHOLAS OF LIVERPOOL COMMANDER
PERHAPS YOU MAY RECOGNIZE SOME PART
YEA AND WHEN HE SHALL PASS SENTENCE UPON ALL THE WORKERS OF INIQUITY LET THEM BE ANGELS OR MEN YOU ALSO SHALL HAVE A VOICE IN THAT JUDGMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE HIS AND YOUR ENEMIES
I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE WITH SEVERAL OF THE MERCHANTS AND MARINERS TO GET UPON SOME PLANKS AND WE WERE CARRIED BY THE CURRENT TO AN ISLAND WHICH LAY BEFORE US
AND THERE HAVING OPENED MY BAG THEY WERE SURPRISED AT THE LARGENESS OF MY DIAMONDS AND CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANY OF SUCH SIZE AND PERFECTION
ON THE 17TH WE CAME IN FULL VIEW OF A GREAT ISLAND OR CONTINENT FOR WE KNEW NOT WHETHER
IT APPEARED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD ME WELL ENOUGH FOR HE SHOOK HIS HEAD BY WAY OF DISAPPROBATION AND HELD HIS HAND IN A POSTURE TO SHOW THAT I MUST BE CARRIED AS A PRISONER
IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPRESS THE JOY I WAS IN UPON THE UNEXPECTED HOPE OF ONCE MORE SEEING MY BELOVED COUNTRY AND THE DEAR PLEDGES I HAD LEFT IN IT
AS EXAMPLES OF ENGLISH THESE BOOKS STAND PREEMINENT
I LAID THE REINS UPON THE NECK OF MY LUSTS
WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING HE PRODUCED THE LETTER OF THE PRIOR OF JORVAULX TO BOIS-GUILBERT
SO THAT WHATEVER MIGHT COME I MIGHT NOT PERISH FOR WANT OF BREAD
AND I BEING WILLING TO INFORM MYSELF AS TO THEIR LAWS AND CUSTOMS ASKED THEM CONCERNING EVERYTHING WHICH I THOUGHT WORTH KNOWING
BEING AS LOATH PERHAPS TO HAVE STAYED IN THIS DESOLATE ISLAND AS I WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE HAD THEM
THE CAPTAIN BEING THE FATTEST HE HELD HIM WITH ONE HAND AS I WOULD DO A SPARROW AND THRUST A SPIT THROUGH HIM
TELL COLONEL MANNERING THAT I KNOW HE'S SEEKING ME
THAT HOWEVER BOTH THEIR MAJESTIES WOULD SOON BE MADE EASY
AT THE YEAR'S END WHEN HE FOUND THEY HAD NOT MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM HE HAD THE CURIOSITY TO MAKE ANOTHER JOURNEY
BUT COULD NOT GUESS THE REASON TILL I HAD A WHISPER FROM A CERTAIN PERSON THAT FLIMNAP AND BOLGOLAM HAD REPRESENTED MY INTERCOURSE WITH THESE AMBASSADORS AS A MARK OF DISAFFECTION FROM WHICH I AM SURE MY HEART WAS WHOLLY FREE
THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN STAYED NO LONGER NEAR THE PALACE NOR CRIED ANY MORE NEW LAMPS FOR OLD ONES BUT MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TO HIS KHAN
SPURN THIS JEW FROM THE GATE HE SAID TO ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS AND SHOOT HIM DEAD IF HE OPPOSE OR TURN AGAIN
THE PATH UPON WHICH THE PARTY TRAVELLED WAS NOW SO NARROW AS NOT TO ADMIT ABOVE TWO RIDERS ABREAST
AT LAST I BELIEVE HE WAS HEARTILY TIRED FOR HE ROSE UP SUDDENLY AND WOULD NOT HEAR A GREAT MANY WHO WERE READY PREPARED TO SPEAK TO HIM BUT WENT AWAY AT WHICH I WAS WELL PLEASED FOR INDEED I BEGAN TO LOSE ALL PATIENCE AND WAS EXTREMELY FATIGUED WITH STAYING SO LONG
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE ROCK AND FOUND OUT THE PLACE BY THE TREE AND OTHER MARKS WHICH HIS BROTHER HAD GIVEN HIM
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE CROWD OF PEOPLE WAS GREAT SHE GOT INTO THE DIVAN A SPACIOUS HALL THE ENTRANCE INTO WHICH WAS VERY MAGNIFICENT
LETTING HIM KNOW AS WELL AS I COULD HOW CRUELLY I WAS HURT BY THE PRESSURE OF HIS THUMB AND FINGER
AND I AM SURE THAT THE OFFER OF THEM WILL SECURE THE FAVOR OF THE SULTAN
AND SO INDEED I HAD
THIS OBSERVATION CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO OBSERVE THE EBBING AND THE FLOWING OF THE TIDE AND I MIGHT VERY EASILY BRING MY BOAT ABOUT THE ISLAND AGAIN
THERE WE FOUND FRUIT AND SPRING WATER WHICH PRESERVED OUR LIVES
ROWENA WAS ABOUT TO PLACE THE CHAPLET WHICH SHE HELD IN HER HAND UPON THE HELMET OF THE CHAMPION WHO KNEELED BEFORE HER WHEN THE MARSHALS EXCLAIMED IT MUST NOT BE THUS HIS HEAD MUST BE BARE AND AT ONCE REMOVED HIS HELMET
BUT HARK THEE GOOD YOUTH THRUST THYSELF NOT TOO FORWARD IN THIS VAIN HURLY-BURLY
BUT FIRST SHOW ME THE HOUSE WHERE YOU LIVE ALADDIN SHOWED THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THE HOUSE AND CARRIED THE TWO PIECES OF GOLD TO HIS MOTHER WHO WENT OUT AND BOUGHT PROVISIONS
WHEN ALADDIN WHO HAD SEEN SUCH A PHANTOM IN THE CAVERN SNATCHED THE LAMP OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S HAND AND SAID TO THE GENIE BOLDLY I AM HUNGRY
THE MAN-MOUNTAIN SHALL NOT DEPART FROM OUR DOMINIONS WITHOUT OUR LICENCE UNDER OUR GREAT SEAL
HE ALSO TOLD HER THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A PLEASANT COMPANION IN LUCY BERTRAM THE DAUGHTER OF AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS WHO WAS GOING TO STAY WITH THEM IN HIS NEW HOUSE
SHOWED THEM MY FORTIFICATIONS THE WAY I MADE MY BREAD PLANTED MY CORN CURED MY GRAPES
HERE I OBSERVED BY THE HELP OF MY PERSPECTIVE GLASS THAT THEY WERE NO LESS THAN THIRTY IN NUMBER
THEY AROSE FROM MY PATERNAL LOVE AND THEREFORE YOU OUGHT TO FORGIVE THE EXCESSES TO WHICH IT HURRIED ME SIRE REPLIED ALADDIN I HAVE NOT THE LEAST REASON TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR CONDUCT SINCE YOU DID NOTHING BUT WHAT YOUR DUTY REQUIRED
HE CANNOT PASS AWAY WITH THAT ON HIS MIND
ALSO WHEN HE SHALL AGAIN RETURN TO THE CITY YOU SHALL GO TOO WITH SOUND OF TRUMPET AND BE EVER WITH HIM
FOR SAID HE YOU WILL SOON BE AT MAN'S ESTATE AND YOU CANNOT TOO EARLY BEGIN TO IMITATE THEIR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY HAD EATEN AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED THEY GOT UP AND PURSUED THEIR WALK THROUGH GARDENS SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER ONLY BY SMALL DITCHES WHICH MARKED OUT THE LIMITS WITHOUT INTERRUPTING THE COMMUNICATION SO GREAT WAS THE CONFIDENCE THE INHABITANTS REPOSED IN EACH OTHER
NOW THERE WAS NOT FAR FROM THE PLACE WHERE THEY LAY A CASTLE CALLED DOUBTING CASTLE THE OWNER WHEREOF WAS GIANT DESPAIR AND IT WAS IN HIS GROUNDS THEY WERE NOW SLEEPING
I HAD A SHORT JACKET OF GOAT'S SKIN THE SKIRTS COMING DOWN TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE THIGHS AND A PAIR OF OPEN-KNEED BREECHES OF THE SAME
IT WAS FIVE FEET TEN INCHES DIAMETER AT THE LOWER PART NEXT THE STUMP AND FOUR FEET ELEVEN INCHES DIAMETER AT THE END OF TWENTY-TWO FEET
RAISED ITSELF UP AGAINST THE TRUNK OF IT AND MEETING WITH MY COMRADE WHO SAT LOWER THAN I SWALLOWED HIM AT ONCE AND WENT OFF
THEY HAD JUST CROSSED A BROOK WHOSE BANKS WERE BROKEN SWAMPY AND OVERGROWN WITH DWARF WILLOWS WHEN THEY WERE ASSAILED IN FRONT FLANK AND REAR BY A LARGE BODY OF MEN IN THE DRESS OF OUTLAWS AND WITH AN IMPETUOSITY TO WHICH IN THEIR CONFUSED AND ILL-PREPARED CONDITION IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OFFER EFFECTUAL RESISTANCE
HE KNOWS AND I KNOW THAT THE BLOOD WILL BE WIPED OUT AND THE LOST WILL BE FOUND AND BERTRAM'S RIGHT AND BERTRAM'S MIGHT SHALL MEET ON ELLANGOWAN HEIGHT
NOW IT SO HAPPENED THAT SHORTLY AFTER ALADDIN HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED BY THE SLAVE OF THE RING TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HIS PALACE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS OF THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW PERCEIVED HIM AND INSTANTLY TOLD HER MISTRESS
WHENCE COME YOU
SO HE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AGAIN AND LED HIM INTO A VERY DARK ROOM WHERE THERE SAT A MAN IN AN IRON CAGE
COLONEL MANNERING FOR SOME REASON NEVER CARED FOR BROWN BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE HE HAD FOOLISHLY LISTENED TO THE DISHONOURABLE SUGGESTIONS OF A FRIEND WHO FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN HAD SECRETLY POISONED HIS MIND AGAINST THE YOUNG OFFICER
FOR THE FACT IS THAT THE MERCHANTS COME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIS VALLEY WHEN THE EAGLES HAVE YOUNG ONES AND THROWING GREAT JOINTS OF MEAT INTO THE VALLEY THE DIAMONDS UPON WHOSE POINTS THEY FALL STICK TO THEM
SO POINTING TO HIM HE MADE SIGNS TO ME TO LET HIM GO TO HIM
THE FLUSH PASSED FROM HIS BROW AND GAVE WAY TO THE PALLID HUE OF DEATH
WE WERE NOW IN THE LATITUDE OF 30 DEGREES SOUTH
LASTLY I DESIRED HIM TO SEE THE BREECHES I HAD THEN ON WHICH WERE MADE OF A MOUSE'S SKIN
AND NOW I THOUGHT MYSELF PRETTY WELL FREIGHTED AND BEGAN TO THINK HOW I SHOULD GET TO SHORE WITH THEM HAVING NEITHER SAIL OAR NOR RUDDER
THE CROWD DISPERSED INDEED BUT THE KNIGHT WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
THITHER COLONEL MANNERING WENT TO LOOK FOR HIM
THERE WERE SHOULDERS LEGS AND LOINS SHAPED LIKE THOSE OF MUTTON AND VERY WELL DRESSED BUT SMALLER THAN THE WINGS OF A LARK
AND CHRISTIAN BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN THAT WAS ON HIS BACK BEGAN TO SINK IN THE MIRE
THESE I TOOK OUT AND FASTENED AS STRONGLY AS I COULD UPON MY NOSE AND THUS ARMED WENT ON BOLDLY WITH MY WORK IN SPITE OF THE ENEMY'S ARROWS MANY OF WHICH STRUCK AGAINST THE GLASSES OF MY SPECTACLES BUT WITHOUT ANY OTHER EFFECT FURTHER THAN A LITTLE TO DISCOMPOSE THEM
AT ONE END OF THIS GHASTLY APARTMENT WAS A LARGE FIRE-GRATE OVER THE TOP OF WHICH WERE STRETCHED SOME TRANSVERSE BARS OF IRON HALF DEVOURED WITH RUST
WHEN THEY WERE GONE OVER AND WERE GOT INTO THE PATH THEY FOUND IT VERY EASY FOR THEIR FEET
AS HE REFLECTED ON HIS POSITION HE CAME TO A DETERMINATION TO SEE HATTERAICK IF POSSIBLE AND TO INDUCE HIM BY A TEMPTING BRIBE TO GIVE EVIDENCE IN HIS FAVOUR WHEN HIS TRIAL CAME ON
HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF IVANHOE AS HE FIRST CAME INTO THE APARTMENT BUT HAD LOST SIGHT OF HIM OWING TO THE CROWD OF EAGER LISTENERS BY WHICH THE ROOM WAS NOW THRONGED
I LAY DOWN ON MY FACE TO KISS HIS HAND WHICH HE VERY GRACIOUSLY GAVE ME
AFTER A ROUGH AND DANGEROUS VOYAGE BY NIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MORNING OFF THE SCOTTISH COAST
ORLANDO LIKE ROSALIND'S FATHER WAS BEING KEPT OUT OF HIS INHERITANCE BY HIS BROTHER AND WAS SO SAD AT HIS BROTHER'S UNKINDNESS THAT UNTIL HE SAW ROSALIND HE DID NOT CARE MUCH WHETHER HE LIVED OR DIED
MODERATE YOUR ASTONISHMENT AND DO NOT EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS
HOW IS IT THEN THAT THOU HAST RUN AWAY FROM THE KING
MY WIFE RAN OUT TO EMBRACE ME BUT I STOOPED LOWER THAN HER KNEES THINKING SHE COULD OTHERWISE NEVER BE ABLE TO REACH MY MOUTH
BUT I SAY HE FOUND THEM ALIVE
THE THIRD VOYAGE I SOON AGAIN GREW WEARY OF LIVING A LIFE OF IDLENESS AND HARDENING MYSELF AGAINST THE THOUGHT OF ANY DANGER I EMBARKED WITH SOME MERCHANTS ON ANOTHER LONG VOYAGE
AND FERDINAND PATIENTLY OBEYED AND THOUGHT HIS TOIL ALL TOO WELL REPAID BY THE SYMPATHY OF THE SWEET MIRANDA
I WALKED TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST COAST OVER AGAINST BLEFUSCU
WHEREIN O APOLLYON HAVE I BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO HIM
AND HEAR ME NOW--LET THAT MAN POINTING TO HATTERAICK DENY WHAT I SAY IF HE CAN AND THEN SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HOW THE YOUNG BOY HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF FROM WARROCH WOOD
DO ME THE FAVOR TO HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THE CAPTAIN WAS AT LENGTH PERSUADED THAT I WAS NO CHEAT
SHE WAS AT THE SAME TIME HALF SINGING AND HALF MUTTERING A KIND OF CHARM WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE REFERENCE TO THE CHILD WHICH HAD BEEN BORN THE NIGHT BEFORE
BUT NOW THE SIGHT OF THE FAIR ROSALIND GAVE HIM STRENGTH AND COURAGE SO THAT HE DID MARVELOUSLY AND AT LAST THREW CHARLES TO SUCH A TUNE THAT THE WRESTLER HAD TO BE CARRIED OFF THE GROUND
HIS LIGHTEST WORD WOULD WEIGH DOWN THE MOST SOLEMN PROTESTATIONS OF THE DISTRESSED JEWESS AND YET TO HIMSELF YES BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT TO THYSELF I APPEAL WHETHER THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE NOT FALSE THERE WAS A PAUSE
ALL KINDS OF RARE PLANTS AND TREES GROW THERE ESPECIALLY CEDARS AND COCOANUT
I MADE BY WAY OF DEVOTION A PILGRIMAGE TO THE PLACE WHERE ADAM WAS CONFINED AFTER HIS BANISHMENT FROM PARADISE AND HAD THE CURIOSITY TO GO TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE TALES WERE WRITTEN EXCEPT THAT THEY CAME OUT OF THE FAR EAST INDIA ARABIA AND PERSIA
AT LAST MY RAFT WAS BROUGHT IN AND THE BALES OPENED IN HIS PRESENCE
BESIDES THIS WAS IT SEEMS ONE OF THE THREE WHO WERE NOT SO HEARTY IN THE MUTINY AS THE REST OF THE CREW AND THEREFORE WAS EASILY PERSUADED NOT ONLY TO YIELD BUT AFTERWARDS TO JOIN VERY SINCERELY WITH US
THEN SAID BASSANIO IN BELMONT IS A LADY RICHLY LEFT AND FROM ALL QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE RENOWNED SUITORS COME TO WOO HER NOT ONLY BECAUSE SHE IS RICH BUT BECAUSE SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD AS WELL
THEN SAID THE MAN NEIGHBORS WHEREFORE ARE YOU COME
SHE REPENTED OF HER FOOLISH CURIOSITY AND CURSED HER DESIRE OF PRYING INTO THE AFFAIRS OF HER BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW
AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT OF THE TWO PALACES HE HASTENED DOWN THE LEAST FREQUENTED STREETS
AS THE TRAVELLERS JOURNEYED ON THEIR WAY THEY WERE ALARMED BY REPEATED CRIES FOR ASSISTANCE
THE SHOUT I HEARD WAS UPON THE ARRIVAL OF THIS ENGINE WHICH IT SEEMS SET OUT IN FOUR HOURS AFTER MY LANDING
HE SAID THEY SAW MY STICK AND HANDKERCHIEF THRUST OUT OF THE HOLE AND CONCLUDED THAT SOME UNHAPPY MAN MUST BE SHUT UP IN THE CAVITY
I SHOT SEVERAL ARROWS AMONG THEM AND AT LAST ONE OF THE ELEPHANTS FELL WHEN THE REST RETIRED IMMEDIATELY AND LEFT ME AT LIBERTY TO GO AND ACQUAINT MY PATRON WITH MY SUCCESS
TELL ME I CONJURE YOU
ALL I VENTURED WAS TO RAISE MINE EYES TOWARD THE SUN AND PLACE MY HANDS TOGETHER IN A SUPPLICATING POSTURE AND TO SPEAK SOME WORDS IN AN HUMBLE MELANCHOLY TONE SUITABLE TO THE CONDITION I THEN WAS IN
AND THEY CONTRIVED THEIR BUSINESS VERY WELL FOR THEY CAME UP TO THE SHIP ABOUT MIDNIGHT
ALSO THE PIT OF HELL OPENED HER MOUTH JUST WHERE I STOOD
I GAVE HIM SOME MILK IN AN EARTHEN POT AND LET HIM SEE ME DRINK IT BEFORE HIM AND SOP MY BREAD IN IT
AND IF YOU WILL GO ALONG WITH ME AND HOLD IT YOU SHALL FARE AS I MYSELF
AS FOR LIQUORS I FOUND SEVERAL CASES OF BOTTLES BELONGING TO OUR SKIPPER IN WHICH WERE SOME CORDIAL WATERS
IN THE CHARACTERS OF CRUSOE GULLIVER AND CHRISTIAN TO MENTION ONLY THREE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLE RECOGNIZE PICTURES OF THE INDEPENDENT SELF-RELIANT MEN OFTEN SELF-EDUCATED AT LEAST IN MANY IMPORTANT PARTICULARS ADVENTUROUS AND DARING BY NATURE DEPENDENT UPON THEMSELVES AND THE USE OF THEIR FACULTIES FOR HAPPINESS WHO MADE ENGLAND GREAT AMONG NATIONS AND WROTE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
GRADUALLY THE GALLERIES BECAME FILLED WITH KNIGHTS NOBLES AND LADIES WHILE THE LOWER SPACE WAS CROWDED WITH YEOMEN AND BURGHERS
I THOUGHT IT THE MOST PRUDENT METHOD TO LIE STILL AND MY DESIGN WAS TO CONTINUE SO TILL NIGHT WHEN MY LEFT HAND BEING ALREADY LOOSE I COULD EASILY FREE MYSELF
STAND BACK MY MASTERS SAID THE BLACK KNIGHT TO THOSE ABOUT HIM
ON AWAKENING FROM THE STUPOR INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN THROWN BY THE UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE HE DETERMINED TO ENDEAVOUR TO SEIZE HIS BROTHER AND HOLD HIM A PRISONER
THEN PROSPERO RELEASED HIM FROM HIS SERVITUDE AND GLAD AT HEART HE GAVE HIS CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE
THERE WERE NO RIVALS
THE GRAND VIZIER'S SON WHO WAS ALMOST PERISHED WITH COLD BY STANDING IN HIS THIN UNDER-GARMENT ALL NIGHT NO SOONER HEARD THE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR THAN HE GOT OUT OF BED AND RAN INTO THE ROBING CHAMBER WHERE HE HAD UNDRESSED HIMSELF THE NIGHT BEFORE
FOR OLD AS I AM I HAVE EXTRAORDINARY GOOD EYES
WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CATCH ANY OF THESE BIRDS THEY WOULD BOLDLY TURN AGAINST ME ENDEAVORING TO PECK MY FINGERS WHICH I DURST NOT VENTURE WITHIN THEIR REACH
AND BEFORE LONG THE FOLLOWERS OF THE KING WERE IN COMPLETE POSSESSION OF THE ENTIRE CASTLE
I DREAMED AND BEHOLD I SAW A MAN CLOATHED WITH RAGS STANDING IN A CERTAIN PLACE WITH HIS FACE FROM HIS OWN HOUSE A BOOK IN HIS HAND AND A GREAT BURDEN UPON HIS BACK
HE HAD A VERY GOOD COUNTENANCE NOT A FIERCE AND SURLY ASPECT BUT SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING VERY MANLY IN HIS FACE
AND OF THAT SOME TIME AFTER THIS I WAS LIKELY TO HAVE TOO MUCH
AND I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE AT THE HEAD OF THIS WAY THAT IF I CALLED HERE YOU WOULD SHEW ME EXCELLENT THINGS SUCH AS WOULD BE A HELP TO ME IN MY JOURNEY
AS SOON AS ALADDIN SAW HIM HE CRIED OUT PRAY UNCLE LEND ME YOUR HAND TO HELP ME OUT GIVE ME THE LAMP FIRST REPLIED THE MAGICIAN
WHERE WAS THE VESSEL THAT BROUGHT THEM
GENIE SAID ALADDIN I COMMAND THEE IN THE NAME OF THIS LAMP BRING A ROC'S EGG TO BE HUNG UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOME OF THE HALL OF THE PALACE ALADDIN HAD NO SOONER PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS THAN THE HALL SHOOK AS IF READY TO FALL
HE ALSO SAT DOWN IN THAT PLACE TO EAT BREAD AND TO DRINK OF THE BOTTLE THAT WAS GIVEN HIM A LITTLE BEFORE
THE KING AND ALL HIS COURT WITH THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PERSONS IN THE CITY SOUGHT TO SOFTEN MY SORROW BY HONORING THE FUNERAL CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE
IN A COWSLIP'S BELL I LIE
WE CAST ANCHOR WITHIN A LEAGUE OF THE CREEK AND OUR CAPTAIN SENT A DOZEN OF HIS MEN WELL ARMED IN THE LONG-BOAT WITH VESSELS FOR WATER IF ANY COULD BE FOUND
IN RETURN TO WHICH I HEARD A GREAT SHOUT REPEATED THREE TIMES GIVING ME SUCH TRANSPORTS OF JOY AS ARE NOT TO BE CONCEIVED BUT BY THOSE WHO FEEL THEM
IT WILL LEAD YOU INTO A PALACE DIVIDED INTO THREE GREAT HALLS
CLOSE BY THE RUIN THEY WERE SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY MEG MERRILIES WHO ADDRESSED BERTRAM SAYING
I BEG YOU WOULD DO ME THE HONOR TO SUP WITH ME THOUGH MY ENTERTAINMENT MAY NOT BE WORTHY OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE
OH BY WHAT TONGUE OR PEN CAN THEIR GLORIOUS JOY BE EXPRESSED
I SERVE HIM WHO POSSESSES THE RING ON THY FINGER
HE USED TO SLIP INTO THE DAIRIES AND TAKE THE CREAM AWAY AND GET INTO THE CHURN SO THAT THE BUTTER WOULD NOT COME AND TURN THE BEER SOUR AND LEAD PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR WAY ON DARK NIGHTS AND THEN LAUGH AT THEM AND TUMBLE PEOPLE'S STOOLS FROM UNDER THEM WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO SIT DOWN AND UPSET THEIR HOT ALE OVER THEIR CHINS WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO DRINK
BUT I SELECTED FOR MYSELF IN THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY THOSE WHICH YOU SEE IN THIS BAG I HAD SCARCELY DONE SPEAKING WHEN THE OTHER MERCHANTS CAME CROWDING ABOUT US MUCH ASTONISHED TO SEE ME
AND HERE I STAND AGAIN TO BID GOD PROSPER THE JUST HEIR OF ELLANGOWAN THAT WILL SOON BE BROUGHT TO HIS OWN
ONE OF THE MERCHANTS WHO HAD TAKEN ME INTO HIS FRIENDSHIP INVITED ME TO GO ALONG WITH HIM
AS TO WEAPONS I TOOK THEM ALL INTO MY SIDE EVERY NIGHT
AND BY WHOSE AUTHORITY IS THIS BOLD OUTRAGE OFFERED BY MY AUTHORITY SAID THE KING RAISING HIS VISOR AND BY THE ORDER OF RICHARD PLANTAGENET WHO STANDS BEFORE YOU WHILE HE SPOKE THE ROYAL STANDARD OF ENGLAND WAS SEEN TO FLOAT OVER THE TOWERS OF THE PRECEPTORY INSTEAD OF THE TEMPLE BANNER
I AM RICHARD OF ENGLAND AT THESE WORDS THE YEOMEN KNEELED DOWN BEFORE HIM TENDERING THEIR ALLEGIANCE WHILE THEY IMPLORED PARDON FOR THEIR OFFENCES
HE WAS FOR A TIME THE PARISH SCHOOLMASTER AT THE VILLAGE OF KIPPLETRINGAN WHICH WAS CLOSE TO ELLANGOWAN AND WAS EMPLOYED NOW AND THEN AS A KIND OF CLERK BY THE LAIRD
AT THE SIGHT OF SO FRIGHTFUL A GENIE WE BECAME INSENSIBLE AND LAY LIKE DEAD MEN
SHE HAD NOT WAITED LONG BEFORE THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS GOT UP OPENED THE WINDOW AND FINDING NO LIGHT AND HEARING NO NOISE OR ANY ONE STIRRING IN THE HOUSE GAVE THE APPOINTED SIGNAL BY THROWING LITTLE STONES SEVERAL OF WHICH HIT THE JARS AS HE DOUBTED NOT BY THE SOUND THEY GAVE
ONE DAY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WAS NEPHEW TO MY NURSE'S GOVERNESS CAME AND PRESSED THEM BOTH TO SEE AN EXECUTION
THE NEGROES FED US AFTERWARD WITH RICE PREPARED WITH OIL OF COCOANUTS
YOUR HAND HAS SEALED MY EVIDENCE AND SHORTLY AFTER AS SHE HEARD THE CROWD ABOUT HER GREET BERTRAM WITH ENTHUSIASTIC CHEERS AS THE TRUE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN HER TROUBLED SPIRIT PASSED PEACEFULLY AWAY
PILGRIM'S PROGRESS JOHN BUNYAN THE SON OF A MAN WHO MENDED BROKEN KETTLES AND PANS A TINKER WAS BORN IN ENGLAND IN 1628
THEN THE INTERPRETER TOOK HIM AND LED HIM UP TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE PALACE
AND HE TO AVOID ANY SUSPICION PUT THE LIGHT OUT SOON AFTER AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN IN HIS CLOTHES THAT HE MIGHT BE THE MORE READY TO RISE
AND THE WIND DRIVING US TOWARD THE SHORE WE HASTENED OUR DESTRUCTION WITH OUR OWN HANDS PULLING AS WELL AS WE COULD TOWARD LAND
AND WHAT IN THE DARK I HAD TAKEN TO BE A STUMP OF A LITTLE TREE APPEARING ABOVE THE SNOW TO WHICH I HAD TIED MY HORSE PROVED TO HAVE BEEN THE CROSS OR WEATHERCOCK OF THE STEEPLE
AND THEN KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT TAKE A ROUND ALWAYS ANSWERING WHEN THE OTHERS HALLOOED TO DRAW THEM AS FAR INTO THE ISLAND AND AMONG THE WOODS AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WHEEL ABOUT AGAIN TO ME BY SUCH WAYS AS I DIRECTED THEM
I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN I PERCEIVED HIM RUN MY WAY AND ESPECIALLY WHEN AS I THOUGHT I SAW HIM PURSUED BY THE WHOLE BODY
AND THEY OFFERED ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE MY EQUAL SHARE OF THE NEGROES WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PART OF THE STOCK
COMMAND ME I AM READY TO OBEY I AM OVERJOYED CHILD SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN EMBRACING HIM
IF I HELP YOU WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO NOTHING
WHILE YET THE TEMPEST WAS RAGING PROSPERO SHOWED HIS DAUGHTER THE BRAVE SHIP LABORING IN THE TROUGH OF THE SEA AND TOLD HER THAT IT WAS FILLED WITH LIVING HUMAN BEINGS LIKE THEMSELVES
BY W IN ORDER TO REACH SOME OF OUR ENGLISH ISLANDS WHERE I HOPED FOR RELIEF
AFTER SOME CONVERSATION WITH THE LAIRD THE GIPSY WOMAN INFORMED HIM THAT SHE HAD COME TO TELL THE FORTUNE OF HIS LITTLE SON WHO WAS BORN THAT NIGHT AND ASKED TO BE TOLD THE EXACT HOUR OF HIS BIRTH
FOR I WAS FAIN TO DIP FOR IT INTO THE WATER A WORK WHICH FATIGUED ME VERY MUCH
SO PUCK SET OFF AND WANDERING THROUGH THE WOOD FOUND NOT DEMETRIUS BUT LYSANDER ON WHOSE EYES HE PUT THE JUICE
ADVANCING INTO THE INTERIOR PARTS OF RUSSIA I FOUND TRAVELLING ON HORSEBACK RATHER UNFASHIONABLE IN WINTER SO I SUBMITTED AS I ALWAYS DO TO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY TOOK A SINGLE HORSE SLEDGE AND DROVE TOWARDS ST PETERSBURG
HE SHALL BE OUR ALLY AGAINST OUR ENEMIES IN THE ISLAND OF BLEFUSCU AND DO HIS UTMOST TO DESTROY THEIR FLEET WHICH IS NOW PREPARING TO INVADE US
HE ACCORDINGLY MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF
THIS DAY HAVE YE QUENCHED SEVEN SMOKING HEARTHS--SEE IF YOUR OWN FIRE BURN THE BLITHER FOR THAT
IN THIS EDIFICE IT WAS DETERMINED I SHOULD LODGE
FOR WE ALL KNEW THAT WHEN THE BOAT CAME NEAR THE SHORE SHE WOULD BE DASHED IN A THOUSAND PIECES BY THE BREACH OF THE SEA
I CALLED OUT SEVERAL TIMES AS LOUD AS I COULD RAISE MY VOICE BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
I FOUND IT FULLY CULTIVATED
SHALL I NOT BE ABANDONED FOR THIS AND SENT BACK FROM THENCE ASHAMED
IF YOU REMEMBER HE THAT I FIRST SAW CALLED HIMSELF THE SLAVE OF THE RING ON MY FINGER
I REMARKED AT THE SAME TIME NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT THE SHAFT OF A COAL-PIT AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT MY WIFE AND HER UNFORTUNATE COMPANIONS HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN IT
THEREFORE HE RESOLVED TO VENTURE AND STAND HIS GROUND
MOST RIGHTEOUS JUDGE CRIED SHYLOCK
AT THAT PLIABLE BEGAN TO BE OFFENDED AND ANGERLY SAID TO HIS FELLOW IS THIS THE HAPPINESS YOU HAVE TOLD ME ALL THIS WHILE OF
YOU ARE NOW GOING TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC AND JACOB AND TO THE PROPHETS MEN THAT GOD HATH TAKEN AWAY FROM THE EVIL TO COME AND THAT ARE NOW RESTING UPON THEIR BEDS EACH ONE WALKING IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHEN THE FROG WAS GOT IN IT HOPPED AT ONCE HALF THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT AND THEN OVER MY HEAD BACKWARD AND FORWARD DAUBING MY FACE AND CLOTHES WITH ITS ODIOUS SLIME
I UNDERSTOOD HIM IN MANY THINGS AND LET HIM KNOW I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED WITH HIM
THE CAPTAIN CALLED IN AT ONE OR TWO PORTS AND SENT IN HIS LONGBOAT FOR PROVISIONS AND FRESH WATER
BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE GENIE DISAPPEARED IMMEDIATELY AND IN AN INSTANT RETURNED WITH A LARGE SILVER TRAY HOLDING TWELVE COVERED DISHES OF THE SAME METAL WHICH CONTAINED THE MOST DELICIOUS VIANDS
YOU MUST LEAVE THE COURT AT ONCE HE SAID TO ROSALIND
BUT I SUSPECTING SOME TRICK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS TASTE IT WHICH HAPPENED WELL FOR ME
AND SHOWING IT TO HIS GUIDE ASKED HIM WHICH HOUSE IT WAS THAT OR THE FIRST
I HAVE DONE DESPITE TO THE SPIRIT OF GRACE
AND 4
I LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SERVANTS AND ONE OR TWO FRIENDS WHO WERE IN THE HOUSE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PYGMIES AND I A GIANT
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOW I HAD AS I MAY CALL IT TWO PLANTATIONS IN THE ISLAND--ONE MY LITTLE FORTIFICATION OR TENT WITH THE WALL ABOUT IT UNDER THE ROCK WITH THE CAVE BEHIND ME WHICH BY THIS TIME I HAD ENLARGED INTO SEVERAL APARTMENTS OR CAVES ONE WITHIN ANOTHER
AND THUS HAVING FOUND TWO OR THREE BROKEN OARS BELONGING TO THE BOAT--AND BESIDES THE TOOLS WHICH WERE IN THE CHEST I FOUND TWO SAWS AN AXE AND A HAMMER WITH THIS CARGO I PUT TO SEA
NOBLE KNIGHT THEN SAID LOCKSLEY I WOULD FAIN BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF ANOTHER GIFT
NOTHING IS MORE WORTHY OF ADMIRATION THAN THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE
THEN CHRISTIAN PULLED IT OUT OF HIS BOSOM AND BEGAN TO TRY AT THE DUNGEON DOOR WHOSE BOLT AS HE TURNED THE KEY GAVE BACK AND THE DOOR FLEW OPEN WITH EASE AND CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL BOTH CAME OUT
HE EARLY BECAME AN ACTOR AND FROM CORRECTING PLAYS BY OTHER PEOPLE HE CAME TO WRITING PLAYS HIMSELF
SO THEY WERE FORCED TO GO BECAUSE HE WAS STRONGER THAN THEY
AND ARE YE NOT EXPELLING ME--ME AND THAT INNOCENT GIRL FRIENDLESS HOUSELESS AND PENNILESS FROM THE HOUSE THAT HAS SHELTERED US AND OURS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE CARRIAGE WAS ANNOUNCED IN WHICH LUCY BERTRAM AND HER FATHER WERE TO LEAVE THEIR HOME
WHEN TWO OF THE THREE MONTHS WERE PASSED HIS MOTHER ONE EVENING HAVING NO OIL IN THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO BUY SOME AND FOUND A GENERAL REJOICING--THE HOUSES DRESSED WITH FOLIAGE SILKS AND CARPETING AND EVERY ONE STRIVING TO SHOW THEIR JOY ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY
ATKINS FELL UPON HIS KNEES TO BEG THE CAPTAIN TO INTERCEDE WITH THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS LIFE
ANOTHER DAY GLUMDALELITCH LEFT ME ON A SMOOTH GRASS PLOT TO DIVERT MYSELF WHILE SHE WALKED AT SOME DISTANCE WITH HER GOVERNESS
GET UP AND EAT
I SWAM ROUND HER TWICE AND THE SECOND TIME I SPIED A SMALL PIECE OF ROPE WHICH I WONDERED I DID NOT SEE AT FIRST HUNG DOWN BY THE FORE-CHAINS SO LOW AS THAT WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY I GOT HOLD OF IT AND BY THE HELP OF THAT ROPE I GOT UP INTO THE FORECASTLE OF THE SHIP
AND THE CARPENTER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY COME AND SAW A HOLE IN THE COVER LARGE ENOUGH TO PULL ME OUT
AND TWO SERVANTS COULD EASILY FILL IT IN HALF AN HOUR
NO LAND TO BE SEEN EXCEPT SOME ROCKS WHICH LAY A GREAT WAY OFF
MY MEN WOULD FAIN HAVE HAD ME GIVE THEM LEAVE TO FALL UPON THEM AT ONCE IN THE DARK
AND IF WE HAPPENED TO KILL ONE THEY WOULD ALL FALL UPON US AND DESTROY US
BUT BEING NOW A NARDAC OF THE HIGHEST RANK IN THAT EMPIRE SUCH OFFICES WERE LOOKED DOWN UPON AS BELOW MY DIGNITY AND THE EMPEROR TO DO HIM JUSTICE NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THEM TO ME
SPEAK SHE SAID IF THOU ART A MAN
HE QUESTIONED BERTRAM AS TO HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD AND ELICITED FROM HIM SOME OF THE INCIDENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE WITH WHICH THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED
AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT FROM THE GREAT INTERCOURSE OF TRADE AND COMMERCE BETWEEN BOTH REALMS FROM THE CONTINUAL RECEPTION OF EXILES WHICH IS MUTUAL AMONG THEM AND FROM THE CUSTOM IN EACH EMPIRE TO SEND THEIR YOUNG NOBILITY AND RICHER GENTRY TO THE OTHER IN ORDER TO POLISH THEMSELVES BY SEEING THE WORLD AND UNDERSTANDING MEN AND MANNERS THERE ARE FEW PERSONS OF DISTINCTION OR MERCHANTS OR SEAMEN WHO DWELL IN THE MARITIME PARTS BUT WHAT CAN HOLD CONVERSATION IN BOTH TONGUES
AT LAST WHEN EVERY MAN STARTED BACK FOR FEAR OF THE ARMED MEN CHRISTIAN SAW A MAN OF A VERY STOUT COUNTENANCE COME UP TO THE MAN THAT SAT THERE TO WRITE SAYING SET DOWN MY NAME SIR
AND HIS ANSWERS WERE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY WHEN QUESTIONED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PURSE WHICH THE GIPSY HAD GIVEN HIM
SO SEND THE HORSEMEN BACK TO THEIR POST QUIETLY
HE WAS THEN PRESSED TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS HAVING WORN A SMUGGLER'S CUTLASS
IF WITHIN TEN DAYS YOU ARE FOUND WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF MY COURT YOU DIE SO ROSALIND SET OUT TO SEEK HER FATHER THE BANISHED DUKE IN THE FOREST OF ARDEN
I FORESAW THAT YOU WOULD REPROACH ME WITH FOLLY AND EXTRAVAGANCE
THEY GAVE ME SEVERAL SORTS OF FOOD AND WHEN I HAD SATISFIED MY HUNGER I RELATED ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WHICH THEY LISTENED TO WITH ATTENTIVE SURPRISE
THE NEXT MORNING AT SUNRISE WE CONTINUED OUR MARCH AND ARRIVED WITHIN TWO HUNDRED YARDS OF THE CITY GATES ABOUT NOON
WHEN FRONT-DE-BOEUF DEEPLY WOUNDED WAS RESCUED BY HIS FOLLOWERS FROM THE FURY OF THE BLACK KNIGHT HE WAS CONVEYED TO HIS CHAMBER
BUT WHAT WAS DONE COULD NOT BE UNDONE
I HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREST WHERE I FOUND A TREE NEWLY PULLED UP AND YOUR BOW AND ARROWS ON THE GROUND AND I DESPAIRED OF EVER SEEING YOU MORE
IN THIS COURSE WE PASSED THE LINE IN ABOUT TWELVE DAYS TIME AND WERE BY OUR LAST OBSERVATION IN 7 DEGREES 22 NORTHERN LATITUDE WHEN A VIOLENT TORNADO OR HURRICANE TOOK US QUITE OUT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE
ALADDIN THOUGHT HIMSELF THE MOST HAPPY OF ALL MEN AT HEARING THIS NEWS AND THANKED HIS MOTHER FOR THE PAINS SHE HAD TAKEN IN THE AFFAIR THE GOOD SUCCESS OF WHICH WAS OF SO GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HIS PEACE THAT HE COUNTED EVERY DAY WEEK AND EVEN HOUR AS IT PASSED
WITHIN A FEW YEARS AFTERWARD THE SULTAN DIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE AND AS HE LEFT NO MALE CHILDREN THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR SUCCEEDED HIM AND SHE AND ALADDIN REIGNED TOGETHER MANY YEARS AND LEFT A NUMEROUS AND ILLUSTRIOUS POSTERITY
WE WILL WALK TOGETHER

THAT QUARTER OF THE PALACE WAS ALL IN AN UPROAR
LAY ONE DOWN IMMEDIATELY THE GENIE DISAPPEARED AND ALADDIN SAW WHAT HE DESIRED EXECUTED IN AN INSTANT
WHILE THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD GIVE ANY REAL ACCOUNT OF THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER NAMELY JULIA MANNERING FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO HERSELF NEVER PRETENDED THAT SHE HAD ANY IDEA WHO HE WAS
OBERON AND TITANIA WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS HAPPY AS THE DAYS WERE LONG HAD THROWN AWAY ALL THEIR JOY IN A FOOLISH QUARREL
I DESIRED HE WOULD ORDER SEVERAL STICKS OF TWO FEET HIGH AND THE THICKNESS OF AN ORDINARY CANE TO BE BROUGHT ME
AND I KEPT ALL THINGS ABOUT OR BELONGING TO HER IN VERY GOOD ORDER
ALTHOUGH PROUD OF HIS RICHES HE WAS VERY GENEROUS WITH THEM AND DELIGHTED TO USE THEM IN RELIEVING THE WANTS OF HIS FRIENDS AMONG WHOM HIS RELATION BASSANIO HELD THE FIRST PLACE
3D
AS SOON AS WE HEARD HIM SNORE ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM NINE OF THE BOLDEST AMONG US AND MYSELF TOOK EACH OF US A SPIT AND PUTTING THE POINTS OF THEM INTO HIS FIRE TILL THEY WERE BURNING HOT WE THRUST THEM INTO HIS EYE ALL AT ONCE AND BLINDED HIM
WHEREAT SHE WAS EXTREMELY REJOICED CALLING THE MAID TO TAKE UP THE DEAD RAT WITH A PAIR OF TONGS AND THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW
BUT I BEHELD IN MY DREAM THAT A MAN CAME TO HIM WHOSE NAME WAS HELP WHO SAID GIVE ME THY HAND
THEY ALSO HAD BUT LITTLE TO SAY FOR THEY KNEW THEMSELVES IN A FAULT
I WAS SOMETHING IMPATIENT AS I HAVE OBSERVED TO HAVE THE USE OF MY BOAT THOUGH VERY LOATH TO RUN ANY MORE HAZARDS
FOR IN A LITTLE TIME AFTER I PERCEIVED MY COMPANIONS HAD LOST THEIR SENSES AND THAT WHEN THEY SPOKE TO ME THEY KNEW NOT WHAT THEY SAID
WHEN HE CAME HOME HE DROVE THE TWO ASSES LOADED WITH GOLD INTO HIS LITTLE YARD AND LEFT THE CARE OF UNLOADING THEM TO HIS WIFE WHILE HE LED THE OTHER TO HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S HOUSE
ALI BABA CAME AFTER WITH SOME NEIGHBORS WHO OFTEN RELIEVED THE OTHERS IN CARRYING THE BIER TO THE BURYING GROUND
PROSPERO DETERMINED TO MAKE ONE LAST USE OF HIS MAGIC POWER AND THEN SAID HE I'LL BREAK MY STAFF AND DEEPER THAN DID EVER PLUMMET SOUND I'LL DROWN MY BOOK SO HE MADE HEAVENLY MUSIC TO SOUND IN THE AIR AND APPEARED TO THEM IN HIS PROPER SHAPE AS THE DUKE OF MILAN
THEY HAD NOT BEEN LONG PUT OFF THE BOAT WHEN WE PERCEIVED THEM ALL COMING ON SHORE AGAIN
HE THEN ORDERED ONE OF THE HORSES TO BE GOT READY MOUNTED HIM AND WENT IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE TROOP OF SLAVES TO THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO ENTREAT HIM TO TAKE A REPAST IN THE PRINCESS'S PALACE ATTENDED BY HIS GRAND VIZIER AND ALL THE LORDS OF HIS COURT
SHYLOCK SUBMITTED TO ALL THESE INDIGNITIES WITH A PATIENT SHRUG
HE THEN COMMANDED HIS GENERAL WHO WAS AN OLD EXPERIENCED LEADER AND A GREAT PATRON OF MINE TO DRAW UP THE TROOPS IN CLOSE ORDER AND MARCH THEM UNDER ME
1
AND THEN THE PILGRIMS GAVE IN UNTO THEM EACH MAN HIS CERTIFICATE WHICH THEY HAD RECEIVED IN THE BEGINNING
HE CARRIED ME WELL
WHEN THE REPAST WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN THE STEWARD SUDDENLY RAISING HIS WAND SAID ALOUD
I PULLED OFF MY SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND WADING TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS I FOUND THE OBJECT TO APPROACH NEARER BY FORCE OF THE TIDE
RIDE YOUR WAYS GODFREY BERTRAM
RIDE YOUR WAYS GODFREY BERTRAM
BUT THE MONEY-LENDER'S ONLY ANSWER WAS IF EVERY DUCAT IN SIX THOUSAND DUCATS WERE IN SIX PARTS AND EVERY PART A DUCAT I WOULD NOT DRAW THEM,--I WOULD HAVE MY BOND IT WAS THEN THAT PORTIA ARRIVED IN HER DISGUISE AND NOT EVEN HER OWN HUSBAND KNEW HER
THEN SAID THE INTERPRETER COME IN I WILL SHEW THEE THAT WHICH WILL BE PROFITABLE TO THEE
I NOW BEGAN TO CONSIDER THAT I MIGHT YET GET A GREAT MANY THINGS OUT OF THE SHIP WHICH WOULD BE USEFUL TO ME AND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE RIGGING AND SAILS AND SUCH OTHER THINGS AS MIGHT COME TO LAND
HE HAD AFTERWARDS BEEN SENT TO INDIA
HE HAD WINGS LIKE A DRAGON FEET LIKE A BEAR AND OUT OF HIS BELLY CAME FIRE AND SMOKE
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN AS BAD AS I WHICH BY THE WAY WAS NOT TRUE FOR IT SEEMS THIS WILL ATKINS WAS THE FIRST MAN THAT LAID HOLD OF THE CAPTAIN WHEN THEY FIRST MUTINIED AND USED HIM BARBAROUSLY IN TYING HIS HANDS AND GIVING HIM INJURIOUS LANGUAGE
I WAS SO TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THAT I KNEW NOT WHETHER I WAS ASLEEP OR AWAKE
AND YET IN TIME BY LABOR APPLICATION AND CONTRIVANCE I FOUND AT LAST THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT I COULD HAVE MADE IT ESPECIALLY IF I HAD HAD TOOLS
AND SO I WILL DELIVER THEE
WHILE STILL ADDRESSING THE GIPSY HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF GUY MANNERING AND WAS ABOUT TO DRAW A WEAPON AGAINST HIM WHEN SHE TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF MR BERTRAM'S
ALADDIN HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN THIS MANNER SEVERAL YEARS WHEN THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN WHO HAD FOR SOME YEARS DISMISSED HIM FROM HIS RECOLLECTION DETERMINED TO INFORM HIMSELF WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER HE PERISHED AS HE SUPPOSED IN THE SUBTERRANEAN CAVE OR NOT
WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO HOLD ON THE SAME COURSE RATHER THAN TURN MORE NORTHERLY WHICH MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT US TO THE NORTHWEST PART OF GREAT TARTARY AND INTO THE FROZEN SEA
BUT HE WAS SOON DEFEATED
I SMILED TO MYSELF AT THE SIGHT OF THIS MONEY
FOR ALL THE CAUTIONS WE COULD GIVE THEM THOSE CRAFTY ANIMALS DESTROYED THEM ONE TIME OR OTHER
IN THE MEANTIME OLIVER HAVING SOUGHT TO TAKE HIS BROTHER ORLANDO'S LIFE ORLANDO ALSO WANDERED INTO THE FOREST AND THERE MET WITH THE RIGHTFUL DUKE AND BEING KINDLY RECEIVED STAYED WITH HIM
IF I BE DROWNED I LOSE NOTHING BUT ONLY CHANGE ONE KIND OF DEATH FOR ANOTHER I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK UPON LARGE PIECES OF TIMBER AND CABLES FOR I HAD A CHOICE OF THEM FROM THE WRECKS AND TIED THEM TOGETHER SO STRONGLY THAT I SOON MADE A VERY SOLID RAFT
HIS OPPONENTS DESPERATE AS THEY WERE NOW BORE BACK FROM HIS DEADLY BLOWS AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE TERROR OF HIS SINGLE STRENGTH WAS ABOUT TO GAIN THE BATTLE AGAINST SUCH ODDS WHEN A KNIGHT IN BLUE ARMOUR WHO HAD KEPT HIMSELF BEHIND THE OTHER ASSAILANTS SPURRED FORWARD WITH HIS LANCE AND TAKING AIM NOT AT THE RIDER BUT AT THE STEED WOUNDED THE NOBLE ANIMAL MORTALLY
WHEREUPON I RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE CITY AND DESIRED HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY TO LEND ME TWENTY OF THE TALLEST VESSELS HE HAD LEFT AFTER THE LOSS OF HIS FLEET AND THREE THOUSAND SEAMEN UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE VICE-ADMIRAL
I ANSWERED AS LOUD AS I COULD IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES AND HE OFTEN LAID HIS EAR WITHIN TWO YARDS OF ME
HOWEVER SINCE THE GENIES FRIGHTEN YOU SO MUCH I WILL TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT AND PUT IT WHERE I MAY FIND IT WHEN I WANT IT
SO WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER CHRISTIAN SAID I WILL HERE GIVE THANKS TO HIM THAT HATH DELIVERED ME OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE LION TO HIM THAT DID HELP ME AGAINST APOLLYON
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS I HAD MY TENT ALWAYS STANDING BEING A PIECE OF A SAIL SPREAD OVER POLES SET UP FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WHICH NEVER WANTED ANY REPAIR OR RENEWING
AND STILL MORE WAS I ENCOURAGED WHEN I FOUND THAT HE OUTSTRIPPED THEM EXCEEDINGLY IN RUNNING AND GAINED GROUND ON THEM
SO BEING REFRESHED HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS JOURNEY WITH HIS SWORD DRAWN IN HIS HAND
TELL HER THAT I WILL COME AND SEE HER TO-NIGHT AND BID HER GET US SOMETHING FOR SUPPER
BEING IN THIS DISCONSOLATE STATE I HEARD OR AT LEAST THOUGHT I HEARD SOME KIND OF GRATING NOISE ON THAT SIDE OF MY BOX WHERE THE STAPLES WERE FIXED
AS THE PALMER WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO HIS ROOM HE INQUIRED OF HIS ATTENDANT WHERE ISAAC THE JEW WAS SLEEPING AND LEARNED THAT HE OCCUPIED THE ROOM NEXT TO HIS OWN
THE BOAT WAS REALLY MUCH BIGGER THAN EVER I SAW A CANOE OR PERIAGUA THAT WAS MADE OF ONE TREE IN MY LIFE
BUT THROUGH LACK OF PRUDENCE AND OTHER MISFORTUNES THEY HAD ONE AFTER ANOTHER LOST MUCH OF THE GREATNESS AND PROSPERITY WHICH HAD BELONGED TO THEM IN BETTER DAYS
MY COURSE WAS DUE EAST
I TREBLED THE CABLE TO MAKE IT STRONGER AND FOR THE SAME REASON I TWISTED THREE OF THE IRON BARS TOGETHER BINDING THE EXTREMITIES INTO A HOOK
ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN WITHOUT DELAY AND THE DRAGOONS WERE SHORTLY AFTER ON THEIR WAY AGAIN TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY CAME
THEIR FATHER DIVIDED A SMALL INHERITANCE EQUALLY BETWEEN THEM
TO EXECUTE THIS DESIGN IT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO GO TO THE TOWN
THE BOATSWAIN WAS KILLED UPON THE SPOT
HE THEN REDOUBLED HIS CRIES AND TEARS SAT DOWN ON THE STEPS WITHOUT ANY HOPES OF EVER SEEING LIGHT AGAIN AND IN AN EXPECTATION OF PASSING FROM THE PRESENT DARKNESS TO A SPEEDY DEATH
AND SAID TO HIM BUT SON WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH GENIES
THUS I FLOATED ON IN PERFECT DARKNESS AND ONCE FOUND THE ARCH SO LOW THAT IT VERY NEARLY TOUCHED MY HEAD WHICH MADE ME CAUTIOUS AFTERWARD TO AVOID THE LIKE DANGER
A WOODY CAPE THAT STRETCHED INTO THE SEA LAY SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VESSEL
HIS NOSE SMALL NOT FLAT LIKE THE NEGROES
WE LOADED THE ELEPHANT WHICH HAD CARRIED US WITH AS MANY TEETH AS HE COULD BEAR
NOTHING FURTHER WAS KNOWN ABOUT HIM AT CHARLIE'S HOPE
AND TOLD THEM I SHOULD PREVAIL WITH THE CAPTAIN TO LEAVE THEM TWO BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER MORE AND SOME GARDEN-SEEDS WHICH I TOLD THEM I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD OF
I AM READY TO OBEY HER COMMAND AND AT THE SAME TIME FOLLOWED THE SLAVES TO THE PALACE
ONE OF THEIR NUMBER BECAME AT LAST SO POOR THAT HE COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN THE OLD FAMILY RESIDENCE
A GOLD RING WHICH ONE DAY SHE MADE ME A PRESENT OF IN A MOST OBLIGING MANNER TAKING IT FROM HER LITTLE FINGER AND THROWING IT OVER MY HEAD LIKE A COLLAR
GULLIVER CAPTURES FIFTY OF THE ENEMY'S SHIPS BY JONATHAN SWIFT THE EMPIRE OF BLEFUSCU IS AN ISLAND SITUATED TO THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF LILLIPUT FROM WHENCE IT IS PARTED ONLY BY A CHANNEL OF EIGHT HUNDRED YARDS WIDE
THE OTHER TWO STOOD ONE ON EACH SIDE TO SUPPORT HIM
ON THE NEXT DAY IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE PRINCE AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE READY TO SUPPORT HIM SHOULD ATTEND A MEETING AT YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING GENERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PLACING THE CROWN UPON THE HEAD OF THE USURPER AND OUSTING KING RICHARD FROM HIS SOVEREIGN RIGHTS
THE SMUGGLER WHOSE VIOLENCE AND STRENGTH WERE WELL KNOWN WAS SECURED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE CONDEMNED WARD
AND SO FOR SOME TIME THE FIGHT WENT ON
AFTER WANDERING FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE RUINED APARTMENTS OF THE CASTLE HE STEPPED OUTSIDE AND HAPPENED BY CHANCE TO STAND ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE HIS FATHER--THE OLD LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN--HAD DIED
WHEN HE IMPLORED PERMISSION TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY ATHELSTANE WAS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO ALLOWING THE DOG OF A JEW AS HE CALLED HIM TO TRAVEL IN THEIR COMPANY
HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME LOST IN ADMIRATION
BUT WITH THIS NEW MEASURE IN THEIR CONDUCT WHICH IT SEEMS THEY CONSULTED TOGETHER UPON VIZ TO LEAVE THREE MEN IN THE BOAT AND THE REST TO GO ON SHORE AND GO UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO LOOK FOR THEIR FELLOWS
AND HAD THE SATISFACTION TO SEE THAT HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHOM HE INVITED HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE MOTIVES OF THE MARRIAGE
THE EAGLES WHICH ARE STRONGER IN THIS COUNTRY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE POUNCE WITH GREAT FORCE UPON THOSE PIECES OF MEAT AND CARRY THEM TO THEIR NESTS ON THE PRECIPICES OF THE ROCKS TO FEED THEIR YOUNG
NO PURSUIT TOOK PLACE AS THE SMUGGLERS HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE DRAGOONS
I DRANK IT OFF AT A DRAUGHT WHICH I MIGHT WELL DO FOR IT DID NOT HOLD HALF A PINT AND TASTED LIKE A SMALL WINE OF BURGUNDY BUT MUCH MORE DELICIOUS
SO YOU MUST PUNCTUALLY EXECUTE WHAT I MAY COMMAND FOR IT IS A MATTER OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE BOTH TO YOU AND ME ALADDIN AMAZED AT ALL HE SAW AND HEARD FORGOT WHAT WAS PAST AND RISING SAID
IN THE TOWN OF LEICESTER ALL MEN KNOW THE RICH JEW KIRJATH JAIRAM OF LOMBARDY
I HAD NOTHING TO COVET FOR I HAD ALL THAT I WAS NOW CAPABLE OF ENJOYING
WHEN HE SHALL COME WITH SOUND OF TRUMPET IN THE CLOUDS AS UPON THE WINGS OF THE WIND YOU SHALL COME WITH HIM
THUS FEAR OF DANGER IS TEN THOUSAND TIMES MORE TERRIFYING THAN DANGER ITSELF WHEN APPARENT TO THE EYES AND WE FIND THE BURDEN OF ANXIETY GREATER BY MUCH THAN THE EVIL WHICH WE ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT
I LIKED THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDED IT WAS DONE WHILE WE WERE NEAR ENOUGH TO COME UP TO THEM BEFORE THEY COULD LOAD THEIR PIECES AGAIN
HE CAME AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AS HE HAD PROMISED AND TOOK ALADDIN WITH HIM TO A MERCHANT WHO SOLD ALL SORTS OF CLOTHES FOR DIFFERENT AGES AND RANKS READY MADE AND A VARIETY OF FINE STUFFS AND BADE ALADDIN CHOOSE THOSE HE PREFERRED WHICH HE PAID FOR
WE TOOK SHIPPING AT THE FIRST PORT WE REACHED AND TOUCHED AT THE ISLE OF ROHA WHERE THE TREES GROW THAT YIELD CAMPHIRE
ROWENA HAD NO SOONER BEHELD HIM THAN SHE UTTERED A FAINT SHRIEK
AND THAT SEEING I HAD OFFERED THEM SO MUCH FAVOR I WOULD BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD
ON THE EIGHTH DAY I CAME NEAR THE SEA AND SAW SOME WHITE PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF GATHERING PEPPER OF WHICH THERE WAS GREAT PLENTY IN THAT PLACE
HE TOLD ME THAT HIS MAJESTY'S MATHEMATICIANS HAVING TAKEN THE HEIGHT OF MY BODY BY THE HELP OF A QUADRANT AND FINDING IT TO EXCEED THEIRS IN THE PROPORTION OF TWELVE TO ONE THEY CONCLUDED FROM THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR BODIES THAT MINE MUST CONTAIN AT LEAST 1724 OF THEIRS AND CONSEQUENTLY WOULD REQUIRE AS MUCH FOOD AS WAS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT NUMBER OF LILLIPUTIANS
AND THAT IF AT LAST THIS WAS ONLY THE PRINT OF MY OWN FOOT I HAD PLAYED THE PART OF THOSE FOOLS WHO TRY TO MAKE STORIES OF SPECTRES AND APPARITIONS AND THEN ARE FRIGHTENED AT THEM MORE THAN ANYBODY
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE DONE
BUT AFTER INNUMERABLE FLUTTERING THOUGHTS LIKE A MAN PERFECTLY CONFUSED AND OUT OF MYSELF I CAME HOME TO MY FORTIFICATION NOT FEELING AS WE SAY THE GROUND I WENT ON BUT TERRIFIED TO THE LAST DEGREE LOOKING BEHIND ME AT EVERY TWO OR THREE STEPS MISTAKING EVERY BUSH AND TREE AND FANCYING EVERY STUMP AT A DISTANCE TO BE A MAN
I CHARGED IMMEDIATELY WITH POWDER AND UPON IT A GOOD HANDFUL OF CHERRYSTONES FOR I HAD SUCKED THE FRUIT AS FAR AS THE HURRY WOULD PERMIT
BUT I HELD MY BREATH AND ASSISTED MYSELF TO SWIM STILL FORWARD WITH ALL MY MIGHT
HE THANKED HIM FOR ALL THE FAVORS HE HAD DONE HIS SON
WHEN DAY APPEARED THE SERPENTS RETIRED AND I CAME OUT OF THE CAVE TREMBLING
AND IT WAS SIGNED AT THE END BY WAMBA AND GURTH BY THE BLACK KNIGHT AND LOCKSLEY
AND THEN BIDDING THE DOOR SHUT CAME AWAY
HAS THE SULTAN BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH OUR POVERTY AND HAD COMPASSION ON US IT IS NO MATTER MOTHER SAID ALADDIN LET US SIT DOWN AND EAT
REBECCA WHO HAD REMAINED WITH HIM UNTIL A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE HAD JUST BEEN CARRIED OFF FORCIBLY BY BOIS-GUILBERT
ADDING WITHAL THE OBLIGATION WAS THE GREATER AS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN NOT MUCH ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD AND THAT HE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO HIS INFORMATION
I GOT WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY OUT OF MY HAMMOCK HAVING FIRST VENTURED TO DRAW BACK THE SLIP-BOARD ON THE ROOF ALREADY MENTIONED CONTRIVED ON PURPOSE TO LET IN AIR FOR WANT OF WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ALMOST STIFLED
MY SON SAID HE BE NOT DISPLEASED AT MY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST YOU
OF HIS BONES ARE CORAL MADE
AFTER THIS I ADVANCED FURTHER INTO THE ISLAND AND AT LAST REACHED A FINE PLAIN WHERE I PERCEIVED SOME HORSES FEEDING
IT WAS DRAWN BY AN UNSKILFUL SURGEON IN A MISTAKE FROM ONE OF GLUMDALCLITCH'S MEN WHO WAS AFFLICTED WITH THE TOOTHACHE BUT IT WAS AS SOUND AS ANY IN HIS HEAD
HE ASKED ME WHO I WAS AND BY WHAT ADVENTURE I HAD COME INTO HIS DOMINIONS
OBERON WANTED THE CHILD TO FOLLOW HIM AND BE ONE OF HIS FAIRY KNIGHTS
I WAS AT INCREDIBLE PAINS IN CUTTING DOWN SOME OF THE LARGEST TIMBER-TREES FOR OARS AND MASTS WHEREIN I WAS HOWEVER MUCH ASSISTED BY HIS MAJESTY'S SHIP-CARPENTERS WHO HELPED ME IN SMOOTHING THEM AFTER I HAD DONE THE ROUGH WORK
BUT I HAPPENED TO SLIP THROUGH HER FINGERS AND SHOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE FALLEN DOWN FORTY FEET UPON THE FLOOR IF BY THE LUCKIEST CHANCE IN THE WORLD I HAD NOT BEEN STOPPED BY A CORKING-PIN THAT STUCK IN THE GOOD GENTLEWOMAN'S STOMACHER
IN THIS DISTRESS THE MATE OF OUR VESSEL LAYS HOLD OF THE BOAT AND WITH THE HELP OF THE REST OF THE MEN THEY GOT HER FLUNG OVER THE SHIP'S SIDE
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN MAY WE GO IN THITHER
BUT WHEN HE ENTERED IT CAME INTO THE HALL AND SAW THE WINDOWS ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS ALL LARGE PERFECT STONES HE WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED AND SAID TO HIS SON-IN-LAW
WHEN WE HAD TALKED A WHILE THE CAPTAIN TOLD ME HE HAD BROUGHT ME SOME LITTLE REFRESHMENT SUCH AS THE SHIP AFFORDED AND SUCH AS THE WRETCHES THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG HIS MASTERS HAD NOT PLUNDERED HIM OF
HE SOON OVERTOOK ME
SHE WILL NOT RECEIVE ME IN THE SAME MANNER THE PRINCESS RECEIVED HER MOTHER WITH SIGHS AND TEARS AND SIGNS OF DEEP DEJECTION
BUT THAT AS FOR THE BOATSWAIN WHO IT SEEMS WAS THE CHIEF OFFICER AMONG THEM AND ALL THE REST THEY WERE AS OUTRAGEOUS AS ANY OF THE SHIP'S CREW AND WERE NO DOUBT MADE DESPERATE IN THEIR NEW ENTERPRISE
TWILIGHT WAS ALREADY COMING ON AS THE COMPANY PROCEEDED ON THEIR JOURNEY
LOOK AT HIM SHE SAID TO THOSE ABOUT HER THE IMAGE OF HIS DEAD FATHER
SHE WENT SIX TIMES AFTERWARD ON THE DAYS APPOINTED PLACED HERSELF ALWAYS DIRECTLY BEFORE THE SULTAN BUT WITH AS LITTLE SUCCESS AS THE FIRST MORNING
IN SHORT THE BIRD ALIGHTED AND SAT OVER THE EGG
BUT WHEN THEY WERE COME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL WHERE THEY COULD SEE A GREAT WAY INTO THE VALLEYS AND WOODS WHICH LAY TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST PART AND WHERE THE ISLAND LAY LOWEST THEY SHOUTED AND HALLOOED TILL THEY WERE WEARY
THE FARMER BY THIS TIME WAS CONVINCED I MUST BE A RATIONAL CREATURE
BEFORE ALADDIN WENT HOME HE CALLED AT A BAKER'S BOUGHT SOME CAKES OF BREAD CHANGED HIS MONEY AND ON HIS RETURN GAVE THE REST TO HIS MOTHER WHO WENT AND PURCHASED PROVISIONS ENOUGH TO LAST THEM SOME TIME
I PULLED OFF MY HAT AND MADE A LOW BOW TOWARD THE FARMER
YIELD THEE DE BRACY SAID THE BLACK CHAMPION STOOPING OVER HIM AND HOLDING AGAINST THE BARS OF HIS HELMET THE FATAL PONIARD WITH WHICH THE KNIGHTS DESPATCHED THEIR ENEMIES
AND THEN ADDED LAUGHING I BELIEVE HE MAY WAIT LONG ENOUGH NOT SO LONG MOTHER AS YOU IMAGINE REPLIED ALADDIN
I UPBRAIDED MYSELF A HUNDRED TIMES FOR NOT BEING CONTENT WITH THE PRODUCE OF MY FIRST VOYAGE THAT MIGHT HAVE SUFFICED ME ALL MY LIFE
HERE THEY ARE SAYS HE HERE'S OUR CAPTAIN AND FIFTY MEN WITH HIM HAVE BEEN HUNTING YOU THESE TWO HOURS
THERE I IMMEDIATELY GAVE LARGE PRESENTS TO THE POOR AND LIVED HONORABLY UPON THE VAST RICHES I HAD BOUGHT AND GAINED WITH SO MUCH FATIGUE
GOD HELP ME TO WATCH AND BE SOBER AND TO PRAY THAT I MAY SHUN THE CAUSE OF THIS MAN'S MISERY
THEN SAID EVANGELIST KEEP THAT LIGHT IN YOUR EYE AND GO UP DIRECTLY THERETO
I FOUND THE TIDE HAD DRIVEN IT STILL NEARER
AND NOW HE BEGAN TO CONSULT WITH ME WHAT COURSE HE SHOULD TAKE
HIS EXCELLENCY HAVING MOUNTED ON THE SMALL OF MY RIGHT LEG ADVANCED FORWARDS UP TO MY FACE WITH ABOUT A DOZEN OF HIS RETINUE
COME AWAY AND PROVE MY WORDS
NOT THAT I AM WISHING ILL TO LITTLE HARRY GOD FORBID
THEREFORE I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE ME LEAVE TO KEEP IT AND TO WEAR IT ALWAYS ON MY FINGER ALADDIN'S MOTHER REPLIED THAT HE MIGHT DO WHAT HE PLEASED
AND AFTER HAVING TRAVELLED A DAY AND A NIGHT I CAME TO MY PATRON
WHICH I FOUND AT SOME TIMES OF THE YEAR VERY VIOLENT
I WAS TAKEN TO A CERTAIN PLACE WHENCE I WAS LED BLINDFOLD TO THE HOUSE AND AFTERWARD BROUGHT BACK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
WELL SAID HE RUBBING HIS HANDS IN GLEE I SHALL HAVE THE LAMP AND I SHALL MAKE ALADDIN RETURN TO HIS ORIGINAL MEAN CONDITION THE NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN LEARNED FROM THE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF THE KHAN WHERE HE LODGED THAT ALADDIN HAD GONE ON A HUNTING EXPEDITION WHICH WAS TO LAST FOR EIGHT DAYS OF WHICH ONLY THREE HAD EXPIRED
TO WHOM IT WAS SAID BY THE OTHER TWO SHINING ONES THESE ARE THE MEN THAT HAVE LOVED OUR LORD WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WORLD AND THAT HAVE LEFT ALL FOR HIS HOLY NAME AND HE HATH SENT US TO FETCH THEM AND WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM THUS FAR ON THEIR DESIRED JOURNEY THAT THEY MAY GO IN AND LOOK THEIR REDEEMER IN THE FACE WITH JOY
ALSO I FORGOT NOT TO TAKE THE MONEY I FORMERLY MENTIONED WHICH HAD LAIN BY ME SO LONG USELESS THAT IT WAS GROWN RUSTY OR TARNISHED AND COULD HARDLY PASS FOR SILVER TILL IT HAD BEEN A LITTLE RUBBED AND HANDLED AS ALSO THE MONEY I FOUND IN THE WRECK OF THE SPANISH SHIP
THE DRUGGIST JUDGING ALADDIN BY HIS HABIT TO BE VERY POOR TOLD HIM HE HAD IT BUT THAT IT WAS VERY DEAR
SINCE MY LAST RETURN I FIND THE BREED IS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED ESPECIALLY THE SHEEP WHICH I HOPE WILL PROVE MUCH TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE WOOLLEN MANUFACTURE BY THE FINENESS OF THE FLEECES
IT IS NOT EASY TO CONCEIVE MY ASTONISHMENT TO FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDST OF A VILLAGE LYING IN A CHURCH-YARD NOR WAS MY HORSE TO BE SEEN BUT I HEARD HIM SOON AFTER NEIGH SOMEWHERE ABOVE ME
CHARLES A CELEBRATED WRESTLER WAS THERE WHO HAD KILLED MANY MEN IN CONTESTS OF THIS KIND
I HAD LESS APPREHENSION CONCERNING THE DOGS WHEREOF THREE OR FOUR CAME INTO THE ROOM AS IS USUAL IN FARMERS
THIS CONFUSION OF MY THOUGHTS KEPT ME AWAKE ALL NIGHT
AND WHEN WE WERE LEFT ALONE DESIRED I WOULD GIVE HIM A RELATION OF MY TRAVELS
AND THESE OFFICERS WHOM YOU SEE ARE TO ASSIST AT THE CAVALCADE TO THE PALACE WHERE THE CEREMONY IS TO BE SOLEMNIZED ALADDIN'S MOTHER ON HEARING THIS NEWS RAN HOME VERY QUICKLY
HAVING DONE THIS WHEN THE EVENING CAME I SHUT MYSELF UP WITHIN THIS CIRCLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY SATISFACTION THAT I HAD NEGLECTED NOTHING WHICH COULD PRESERVE ME FROM THE CRUEL DESTINY WITH WHICH I WAS THREATENED
IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER HE HAD HOISTED THE SAIL AND SOON DISAPPEARED ROUND THE POINT OF WARROCH
AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE THEY WERE UNDER A GREAT SURPRISE TO FIND HER STRIPPED AS ABOVE OF ALL THAT WAS IN HER AND A GREAT HOLE IN HER BOTTOM
THE OFFICER WAS VERY FAITHFUL IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS COMMISSION AND CAUSED ALL THE GOODS TO BE CARRIED TO THE LODGINGS PROVIDED FOR ME
HAVING FINISHED HIS REPAST HE RETURNED TO HIS PORCH WHERE HE LAY AND FELL ASLEEP SNORING LOUDER THAN THUNDER
HE FELL TO WORK
MORE ESPECIALLY THE TOWER OR KAIM OF DERNCLEUGH
I SAW LIKEWISE OTHER FISH ABOUT A CUBIT IN LENGTH THAT HAD HEADS LIKE OWLS
BEFORE THE SULTAN AND THE DIVAN RISE I WOULD HAVE YOU RETURN TO THE PALACE WITH THIS PRESENT AS THE DOWRY DEMANDED FOR THE PRINCESS THAT HE MAY JUDGE BY MY DILIGENCE AND EXACTNESS OF THE ARDENT AND SINCERE DESIRE I HAVE TO PROCURE MYSELF THE HONOR OF THIS ALLIANCE AS SOON AS THIS MAGNIFICENT PROCESSION WITH ALADDIN'S MOTHER AT ITS HEAD HAD BEGUN TO MARCH FROM ALADDIN'S HOUSE THE WHOLE CITY WAS FILLED WITH THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE DESIROUS TO SEE SO GRAND A SIGHT
I HAVE THE SLAVES OF THE LAMP AND OF THE RING TO HELP ME AND YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL THEIR AID IS
AND WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE MORE TO PERSUADE YOU OF HIS WICKED DESIGN
THE ESTATES OF ELLANGOWAN WERE ADVERTISED TO BE SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND A DAY WAS FIXED FOR THE AUCTION
THIS HORN IS SOLID AND CLEFT THROUGH THE MIDDLE
I AM NOW A MAN OF DESPAIR AND AM SHUT UP IN IT AS IN THIS IRON CAGE
THERE IS A FOOLISH LOVER SAID ROSALIND WHO HAUNTS THESE WOODS AND HANGS SONNETS ON THE TREES
FOR AS FOR THEM I NEVER SAW THEM AFTERWARD OR ANY SIGN OF THEM EXCEPT THREE OF THEIR HATS ONE CAP AND TWO SHOES THAT WERE NOT FELLOWS
AS SOON AS HE DISMOUNTED HE RETIRED TO HIS OWN CHAMBER TOOK THE LAMP AND SUMMONED THE GENIE AS USUAL WHO PROFESSED HIS ALLEGIANCE
BUT THE CHANGE WAS NO SOONER MADE THAN THE PLACE RUNG WITH THE SHOUTS OF THE CHILDREN DERIDING THE MAGICIAN'S FOLLY
WHEREIN I DOUBTED SOME AUTHORS LESS CONSULTED TRUTH THAN THEIR OWN VANITY OR INTEREST OR THE DIVERSION OF IGNORANT READERS
I HAD ON A BROAD BELT OF GOAT'S SKIN DRIED WHICH I DREW TOGETHER WITH TWO THONGS OF THE SAME INSTEAD OF BUCKLES AND IN A KIND OF A FROG ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS INSTEAD OF A SWORD AND DAGGER HUNG A LITTLE SAW AND A HATCHET ONE ON ONE SIDE AND ONE ON THE OTHER
MANY A LAW MANY A COMMANDMENT HAVE I BROKEN BUT MY WORD NEVER THUS FAR SAID REBECCA I WILL TRUST THEE AND SHE DESCENDED FROM THE VERGE OF THE BATTLEMENT BUT REMAINED STANDING CLOSE BY ONE OF THE EMBRASURES
THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD MY RAILLERY VERY WELL AND MERRILY REPLIED WITH THE OLD ENGLISH PROVERB THAT HE DOUBTED MINE EYES WERE BIGGER THAN MY BELLY FOR HE DID NOT OBSERVE MY STOMACH SO GOOD ALTHOUGH I HAD FASTED ALL DAY
ON MY WAY TOWARD THEM I HEARD THE VOICE OF A MAN WHO ASKED ME WHO I WAS
IT HAD A COCK NEAR THE BOTTOM TO LET OUT THE WATER WHEN IT BEGAN TO GROW STALE
THEN I BECAME INSENSIBLE
YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO LEAVE THIS WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT ASKED HATTERAICK
NOBODY MEANS TO TOUCH HIS HOUSE SHE ADDED
THE WEDDING WAS A MERRY ONE IN THE MOSSY GLADES OF THE FOREST
WE REEFED THE FORESAIL AND SET HIM AND HAULED AFT THE FORESHEET
IN REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM THE PRISONER SAID THAT HE WAS A CAPTAIN IN A REGIMENT OF HORSE IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE AND IN A FRANK MANLY WAY DESCRIBED HOW THE WOUNDING OF CHARLES HAZLEWOOD WAS MERELY AN ACCIDENT FOR WHICH HE EXPRESSED A SINCERE SORROW
THEY FOUND HOWEVER A CUT UPON HER ARM
SHE MADE WHAT HASTE SHE COULD TO FILL HER OIL-POT AND RETURNED INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE AS SOON AS SHE HAD LIGHTED HER LAMP SHE TOOK A GREAT KETTLE WENT AGAIN TO THE OIL-JAR FILLED THE KETTLE SET IT ON A LARGE WOOD FIRE AND AS SOON AS IT BOILED WENT AND POURED ENOUGH INTO EVERY JAR TO STIFLE AND DESTROY THE ROBBER WITHIN
AFTER THIS THEY THOUGHT OF BURYING THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS WITH HIS COMRADES AND DID IT SO PRIVATELY THAT NOBODY DISCOVERED THEIR BONES TILL MANY YEARS AFTER WHEN NO ONE HAD ANY CONCERN IN THE PUBLICATION OF THIS REMARKABLE HISTORY
POLL AS IF HE HAD BEEN MY FAVORITE WAS THE ONLY PERSON PERMITTED TO TALK TO ME
I'M DANGEROUS THEN SAID GLOSSIN LOSING HIS TEMPER AT LEAST GET UP FOR AN OBSTINATE DUTCH BRUTE BUT HE HAD BARELY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN HATTERAICK SPRANG FROM WHERE HE LAY AND GRAPPLED WITH HIM
I QUESTION EVEN IF IT WERE SOMEWHAT LIGHTER WHETHER YOU COULD SEE TO STITCH YOU DO NOT KNOW ME REPLIED BABA MUSTAPHA
BUT PROSPERO THOUGH SECRETLY DELIGHTED PRETENDED WRATH
THE KING QUEEN AND ALL THE COURT SENT EVERY DAY TO INQUIRE AFTER MY HEALTH AND HER MAJESTY MADE ME SEVERAL VISITS DURING MY SICKNESS
GENIE SAID ALADDIN I ORDERED THEE TO LEAVE ONE OF THE FOUR AND-TWENTY WINDOWS OF THIS HALL IMPERFECT AND THOU HAST EXECUTED MY COMMANDS PUNCTUALLY
SIR SAID CHRISTIAN I AM A MAN THAT AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM GOING TO THE MOUNT ZION
BUT IF THE SHIELD WAS TOUCHED WITH THE SHARP END OF THE LANCE THE KNIGHTS WERE TO FIGHT AS IN ACTUAL BATTLE
ASKING ME WHETHER THE KING AND QUEEN OF THAT COUNTRY WERE THICK OF HEARING
SEE'ST THOU ISAAC HE SAID THE RANGE OF BARS ABOVE THAT GLOWING CHARCOAL
THE NEXT DAY AFTER I CAME HOME TO MY HUTCH WITH HIM I BEGAN TO CONSIDER WHERE I SHOULD LODGE HIM
THE HEAD OF THE PIN PASSED BETWEEN MY SHIRT AND THE WAISTBAND OF MY BREECHES AND THUS I WAS HELD BY THE MIDDLE IN THE AIR TILL GLUMDALCLITCH RAN TO MY RELIEF
SHORTLY AFTER QUITTING THE DOMINIE SHE MET YOUNG HAZLEWOOD ON THE ROAD AND TOLD HIM IN A MYSTERIOUS WAY THAT THE GUARD OF SOLDIERS HAD BEEN DRAWN OFF FROM THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AND BROUGHT TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE IN THE EXPECTATION OF AN ATTACK BEING MADE UPON IT THAT NIGHT
THERE APPEARED BEFORE ME A PERSON OF HIGH RANK FROM HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY
GOD TOOK COMPASSION ON MY HOPELESS STATE
WILL FRY IS WOUNDED AND I AM A PRISONER
WILFRED LIVED LONG AND HAPPILY WITH HIS BRIDE FOR THEY WERE ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER BY THE BONDS OF EARLY AFFECTION AND THEY LOVED EACH OTHER THE MORE FROM THE RECOLLECTION OF THE OBSTACLES WHICH HAD SO LONG IMPEDED THEIR UNION
AND THUS THEY BEGAN TO DISCOURSE
WHAT HAS HE DONE TO OBTAIN FROM THEE A LOT SO AGREEABLE
WHEN I HAD INFORMED HIM HE COMMENDED MY DEXTERITY AND CARESSED ME HIGHLY
THE AIR OF THE SMALL APARTMENT HAD BECOME CLOSE AND CONFINED AND HE GOT UP FOR THE PURPOSE IF POSSIBLE OF OPENING THE WINDOW
THE PRINCESS WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE THE JOYFUL TIDINGS HASTENED HERSELF TO THE WINDOW AND SEEING ALADDIN IMMEDIATELY OPENED IT
HE HAS STRANGLED THE TRUE FATIMA AND DISGUISED HIMSELF IN HER CLOTHES WITH INTENT TO MURDER ME ALADDIN THEN INFORMED HER HOW THE GENIE HAD TOLD HIM THESE FACTS AND HOW NARROWLY SHE AND THE PALACE HAD ESCAPED DESTRUCTION THROUGH HIS TREACHEROUS SUGGESTION WHICH HAD LED TO HER REQUEST
IT IS NOW NIGHT AND HE HAS NOT RETURNED
HE WENT TO SOME OF THE SERVANTS WHOM HE SAW STANDING AT THE GATE IN MAGNIFICENT APPAREL AND ASKED THE NAME OF THE PROPRIETOR
A SHORT PASSAGE AND AN ASCENT OF SOME STEPS LED HIM TO THE LADY'S APARTMENT
FOR MY PART I AM RESOLVED ONE OF THESE DAYS TO TURN HIM OUT OF DOORS AND LET HIM PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF AFTER THESE WORDS ALADDIN'S MOTHER BURST INTO TEARS
AT THIS MOMENT THE BESIEGERS CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RED FLAG UPON THE TOWER WHICH ULRICA HAD DESCRIBED TO CEDRIC
I CANNOT PROMISE SAID HE TO THE ROBBER THAT I CAN REMEMBER THE WAY EXACTLY
HOWEVER I MADE A SHIFT TO GO FORWARD TILL I CAME TO A PART OF THE FIELD WHERE THE CORN HAD BEEN LAID BY THE RAIN AND WIND
I SAW ALSO THAT THE INTERPRETER TOOK HIM AGAIN BY THE HAND AND LED HIM INTO A PLEASANT PLACE WHERE WAS BUILDED A STATELY PALACE BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD
AND HAVING CUT DOWN THE SPRITSAIL-YARD AND THE MIZZEN YARD AND EVERYTHING I COULD TO MAKE A LARGE RAFT I LOADED IT WITH ALL THESE HEAVY GOODS AND CAME AWAY
IN THE MEANTIME I COLLECTED TOGETHER A GREAT QUANTITY OF SMALL WOOD BRAMBLES AND DRY THORNS AND MAKING THEM UP INTO FAGOTS MADE A WIDE CIRCLE WITH THEM ROUND THE TREE AND ALSO TIED SOME OF THEM TO THE BRANCHES OVER MY HEAD
AND BY HIS SILENCE HE GOT RID OF THE CHILDREN AND THE MOB
WHICH WAS SOON CONCLUDED UPON CONDITIONS VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO OUR EMPEROR WHEREWITH I SHALL NOT TROUBLE THE READER
CELIA LOVED HER TOO MUCH TO LET HER GO ALONE AND AS IT WAS RATHER A DANGEROUS JOURNEY ROSALIND BEING THE TALLER DRESSED UP AS A YOUNG COUNTRYMAN AND HER COUSIN AS A COUNTRY GIRL AND ROSALIND SAID THAT SHE WOULD BE CALLED GANYMEDE AND CELIA ALIENA
HERE SINDBAD MADE A NEW PRESENT OF ONE HUNDRED SEQUINS TO HINDBAD WHOM HE REQUESTED TO RETURN WITH THE REST NEXT DAY AT THE SAME HOUR TO DINE WITH HIM AND HEAR THE STORY OF HIS FIFTH VOYAGE
AND TAKING HIS LEAVE OF THE TROOP THAT NIGHT WENT INTO THE TOWN JUST AT DAYBREAK AND WALKED UP AND DOWN TILL ACCIDENTALLY HE CAME TO BABA MUSTAPHA'S STALL WHICH WAS ALWAYS OPEN BEFORE ANY OF THE SHOPS
AND HAVING PUT OUT THE GREAT FIRE SHE HAD MADE TO BOIL THE OIL AND LEAVING JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BROTH PUT OUT THE LAMP ALSO AND REMAINED SILENT RESOLVING NOT TO GO TO REST TILL SHE HAD OBSERVED WHAT MIGHT FOLLOW THROUGH A WINDOW OF THE KITCHEN WHICH OPENED INTO THE YARD
BUT I RECOVERED A LITTLE BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE WAVES AND SEEING I SHOULD BE COVERED AGAIN WITH WATER I RESOLVED TO HOLD FAST BY A PIECE OF THE ROCK AND SO TO HOLD MY BREATH IF POSSIBLE TILL THE WAVE WENT BACK
MY ELDEST UNCLE JOHN HAD LEFT ME AN ESTATE IN LAND NEAR EPPING OF ABOUT THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
I WAS AFRAID ON'T AT THE VERY FIRST AND THEREFORE GAVE YOU THAT GENTLE CAUTION
THE STARTLING ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN ALTHOUGH THE SHORT BOOK FROM WHICH THESE STORIES ARE TAKEN WAS WRITTEN IN 1785 BY RUDOLF ERICH RASPE A GERMAN OF MANY TALENTS WHO TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE IN ENGLAND THERE REALLY WAS A BARON MUNCHAUSEN WHO SERVED THE AUTHOR AS A MODEL
I WENT TOWARD HIM AND SALUTED HIM BUT HE ONLY SLIGHTLY BOWED HIS HEAD
HE MADE ME A SIGN TO PUT THEM AGAIN INTO MY PURSE AND THE PURSE AGAIN INTO MY POCKET WHICH AFTER OFFERING IT TO HIM SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT IT BEST TO DO
HAVING ARRIVED AT THE ISLE OF SERENDIB I WAS CONDUCTED TO THE PALACE WITH MUCH POMP WHEN I PROSTRATED MYSELF ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE KING
THEN I FASTENED MY HANDKERCHIEF TO THE NINE STICKS THAT STOOD ERECT AND EXTENDED IT ON ALL SIDES TILL IT WAS AS TIGHT AS THE TOP OF A DRUM
THEN HE TOOK PITY ON HER AND THREW SOME JUICE OF THE DISENCHANTING FLOWER ON HER PRETTY EYES
THE WEATHER BEING VERY WARM THE CLOSET WINDOW WAS LEFT OPEN AS WELL AS THE WINDOWS AND DOOR OF MY BIGGER BOX IN WHICH I USUALLY LIVED BECAUSE OF ITS LARGENESS AND CONVENIENCY
IN ABOUT A MONTH WHEN ALL WAS PREPARED I SENT TO RECEIVE HIS MAJESTY'S COMMANDS AND TO TAKE MY LEAVE
STEAL HONEY-BAGS FOR HIM FROM THE HUMBLE-BEES AND WITH THE WINGS OF PAINTED BUTTERFLIES FAN THE MOONBEAMS FROM HIS SLEEPING EYES I WILL SAID ONE OF THE FAIRIES AND ALL THE OTHERS SAID I WILL NOW SIT DOWN WITH ME SAID THE QUEEN TO THE CLOWN AND LET ME STROKE YOUR DEAR CHEEKS AND STICK MUSK-ROSES IN YOUR SMOOTH SLEEK HEAD AND KISS YOUR FAIR LARGE EARS MY GENTLE JOY WHERE'S PEASEBLOSSOM ASKED THE CLOWN WITH THE ASS'S HEAD
THOU DIDST ATTEMPT WRONG WAYS TO BE RID OF THY BURDEN WHEREAS THOU SHOULDEST HAVE STAYED TILL THY PRINCE HAD TAKEN IT OFF
THE VICTORIOUS KNIGHT RECEIVED HIS PRIZE SPEAKING NOT A WORD IN REPLY TO THE COMPLIMENTARY EXPRESSIONS OF THE PRINCE WHICH HE ONLY ACKNOWLEDGED WITH A LOW BOW
THE STORY-TELLER WHO ROARS WITH THE LION AND BLEATS WITH THE LAMB IS SURE TO BE REWARDED WITH SHOUTS OF ENTHUSIASTIC DELIGHT FROM THE AUDIENCE
THE NEXT MORNING AT DAYBREAK MORGIANA WENT TO AN OLD COBBLER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE ALWAYS EARLY AT HIS STALL AND BIDDING HIM GOOD-MORROW PUT A PIECE OF GOLD INTO HIS HAND SAYING BABA MUSTAPHA YOU MUST BRING WITH YOU YOUR SEWING TACKLE AND COME WITH ME
AS SOON AS THE CALIPH'S LETTER AND PRESENT WERE DELIVERED TO ME I WENT TO BUSSORAH WHERE I EMBARKED AND HAD A VERY PROSPEROUS VOYAGE
AND I TURNED THIS WAY THE ROBBER TIED HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS EYES AND WALKED BY HIM TILL THEY STOPPED DIRECTLY AT CASSIM'S HOUSE WHERE ALI BABA THEN LIVED
I DID SO
THE SISTER-IN-LAW DID SO BUT AS SHE KNEW ALI BABA'S POVERTY SHE WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF GRAIN HIS WIFE WANTED TO MEASURE AND ARTFULLY PUTTING SOME SUET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE BROUGHT IT TO HER WITH THE EXCUSE THAT SHE WAS SORRY THAT SHE HAD MADE HER STAY SO LONG BUT THAT SHE COULD NOT FIND IT SOONER
THOU DIDST FAINT AT FIRST SETTING OUT WHEN THOU WAST ALMOST CHOKED IN THE GULF OF DISPOND
AND MY OUTER WALL WAS THICKENED WITH PIECES OF TIMBER OLD CABLES AND EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF TO MAKE IT STRONG
THAT AS IT WAS A TRADE THAT COULD NOT BE CARRIED ON BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT PUBLICLY SELL THE NEGROES WHEN THEY CAME HOME SO THEY DESIRED TO MAKE BUT ONE VOYAGE TO BRING THE NEGROES ON SHORE PRIVATELY AND DIVIDE THEM AMONG THEIR OWN PLANTATIONS
BUT ABOVE ALL THINGS PROVIDE A SAFE TREASURE-HOUSE AND FILL IT WITH GOLD AND SILVER
FOR I SHALL NOT ASK ANYTHING OF YOU BUT THAT YOU OBEY ME PUNCTUALLY IF YOU WOULD REAP THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I INTEND YOU
I STORED THE BOAT WITH THE CARCASES OF AN HUNDRED OXEN AND THREE HUNDRED SHEEP WITH BREAD AND DRINK PROPORTIONABLE AND AS MUCH MEAT READY DRESSED AS FOUR HUNDRED COOKS COULD PROVIDE
AND DOUBTING WHETHER ALADDIN UNDERSTOOD THE MATERIAL OR THE FULL VALUE OF WHAT HE OFFERED TO SELL TOOK A PIECE OF GOLD OUT OF HIS PURSE AND GAVE IT HIM THOUGH IT WAS BUT THE SIXTIETH PART OF THE WORTH OF THE PLATE
SO I SET MYSELF TO ENLARGE MY CAVE AND WORK FARTHER INTO THE EARTH FOR IT WAS A LOOSE SANDY ROCK WHICH YIELDED EASILY TO THE LABOR I BESTOWED ON IT
THE LOVER WHO HAD BEEN SERENADING JULIA MANNERING WAS IN REALITY THE SAME VANBEEST BROWN WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN IN INDIA AND WITH WHOM HER FATHER HAD FOUGHT THE DUEL
SOON AFTER MY RETURN FROM LEYDEN I WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY GOOD MASTER MR BATES TO BE SURGEON TO THE SWALLOW CAPTAIN ABRAHAM PANNELL COMMANDER
YOU FELL SAID THEY INTO THE HANDS OF THE OLD MAN OF THE SEA AND ARE THE FIRST WHO EVER ESCAPED STRANGLING BY HIS MALICIOUS EMBRACES
I CONSIDERED THAT THE DEVIL MIGHT HAVE FOUND OUT ABUNDANCE OF OTHER WAYS TO HAVE TERRIFIED ME THAN THIS OF THE SINGLE PRINT OF A FOOT
AND BASSANIO TOOK THE OATH AND WALKED UP TO THE CASKETS--THE MUSICIANS PLAYING SOFTLY THE WHILE
I MYSELF HAVE SEEN TWO OR THREE CANDIDATES BREAK A LIMB
ALADDIN'S MOTHER ASKED THE OIL MERCHANT WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF ALL THIS PREPARATION OF PUBLIC FESTIVITY
WITH THESE WORDS HOPEFUL AT PRESENT DID MODERATE THE MIND OF HIS BROTHER
IT CAME VERY WARMLY UPON MY THOUGHTS AND INDEED IRRESISTIBLY THAT NOW WAS THE TIME TO GET ME A SERVANT AND PERHAPS A COMPANION OR ASSISTANT
WHAT IMPUDENCE IS THIS
I WENT UP TO A RISING GROUND TO LOOK FARTHER
WHAT WAS HE
FOR THE BLOW TAKING MY SIDE AND BREAST BEAT THE BREATH AS IT WERE QUITE OUT OF MY BODY
THEN SAID SHE TAKE THEM INTO THE CASTLE-YARD TO-MORROW AND SHEW THEM THE BONES AND SKULLS OF THOSE THAT THOU HAST ALREADY DISPATCH'D AND MAKE THEM BELIEVE E'ER A WEEK COMES TO AN END THOU ALSO WILT TEAR THEM IN PIECES AS THOU HAST DONE THEIR FELLOWS BEFORE THEM
AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL DEVOTED TO MUTUAL EXPLANATIONS OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED THE SULTAN RESTORED ALADDIN TO HIS FAVOR AND EXPRESSED HIS REGRET FOR THE APPARENT HARSHNESS WITH WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM
WHEREUPON I ONCE MORE THOUGHT OF ATTEMPTING TO BREAK MY BONDS
LEST THEY FOR TRESPASSING HIS PRISONERS ARE WHOSE CASTLE'S DOUBTING AND WHOSE NAME'S DESPAIR
AFTER THEY WERE READ I WAS DEMANDED TO SWEAR TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THEM
TO HIM ACCORDINGLY THE GLOVE OF REBECCA WAS HANDED
PROSPERO BY HIS ENCHANTMENTS DREW THEM ALL TO THE GROVE WITHOUT HIS CELL WHERE THEY WAITED TREMBLING AND AFRAID AND NOW AT LAST BITTERLY REPENTING THEM OF THEIR SINS
NOTHING EVER AFFLICTED ME SO MUCH AS HEARING OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH
WELL SAID THE CAPTAIN ONE OF YOU THE BOLDEST AND MOST SKILFUL AMONG YOU MUST GO INTO THE TOWN DISGUISED AS A TRAVELLER AND A STRANGER TO TRY IF HE CAN HEAR ANY TALK OF THE MAN WHOM WE HAVE KILLED AND ENDEAVOR TO FIND OUT WHO HE WAS AND WHERE HE LIVED
AT LAST SHE SNATCHED THE TABOR FROM ABDALLA WITH HER LEFT HAND AND HOLDING THE DAGGER IN HER RIGHT PRESENTED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABOR AFTER THE MANNER OF THOSE WHO GET A LIVELIHOOD BY DANCING AND SOLICIT THE LIBERALITY OF THE SPECTATORS
GO AND TELL YOUR SON THAT I WAIT WITH OPEN ARMS TO EMBRACE HIM
TAKE THY LIFE UNASKED HE SAID
AND ALL THE REST OF THE CREW ALTHOUGH THEY WERE WASHED OVERBOARD WERE LANDED UNHURT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ISLAND AND THE GOOD SHIP HERSELF WHICH THEY ALL THOUGHT HAD BEEN WRECKED LAY AT ANCHOR IN THE HARBOR WHITHER ARIEL HAD BROUGHT HER
I CONTINUED THIS EMPLOYMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
BRING ME A CHARGER THAT SURPASSES IN BEAUTY AND GOODNESS THE BEST IN THE SULTAN'S STABLES WITH A SADDLE BRIDLE AND OTHER CAPARISONS TO CORRESPOND WITH HIS VALUE
AS SHE PASSED THROUGH THE CROWD OF SQUIRES AND YEOMEN WHO ALREADY FILLED THE LOWER END OF THE VAST APARTMENT A SCRAP OF PAPER WAS THRUST INTO HER HAND WHICH SHE RECEIVED ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY AND CONTINUED TO HOLD WITHOUT EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS
THE WORLD FOR HIM CAN NEVER BE QUITE THE SAME THAT IT WAS BEFORE
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN TO THE MAN WHAT ART THOU THE MAN ANSWERED I AM WHAT I WAS NOT ONCE CHR
I HAD TIMBER ENOUGH TO HAVE BUILT A FLEET OF SHIPS
WE TOUCHED AT SEVERAL PORTS WHERE WE TRADED
MEANWHILE THE SMUGGLERS UNDER THEIR CAPTAIN DIRCK HATTERAICK HAD BEEN CARRYING ON THEIR LAWLESS TRADE AS USUAL AND THE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN WAS AS DETERMINED TO PUT THEM DOWN AS HE HAD BEEN TO GET RID OF THE GIPSIES
HOWEVER THIS SET ME ON RUMMAGING FOR CLOTHES OF WHICH I FOUND ENOUGH BUT TOOK NO MORE THAN I WANTED FOR PRESENT USE FOR I HAD OTHER THINGS WHICH MY EYE WAS MORE UPON--AS FIRST TOOLS TO WORK WITH ON SHORE
IT IS A JEW WHO CALLS HIMSELF ISAAC OF YORK ST MARY SAID THE ABBOT CROSSING HIMSELF AN UNBELIEVING JEW AND ADMITTED INTO THIS PRESENCE A DOG JEW ECHOED THE TEMPLAR TO APPROACH A DEFENDER OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE PEACE MY WORTHY GUESTS SAID CEDRIC
AND AT THE SAME TIME I SAW SEVERAL OTHERS FALL DOWN FROM THE ROCKS IN DIFFERENT PLACES
IF THIS WOMAN COMES TO OUR NEXT AUDIENCE DO NOT FAIL TO CALL HER THAT I MAY HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY THE GRAND VIZIER MADE ANSWER BY LOWERING HIS HAND AND THEN LIFTING IT UP ABOVE HIS HEAD SIGNIFYING HIS WILLINGNESS TO LOSE IT IF HE FAILED
THEN WE SET THE MIZZEN MAINTOPSAIL AND THE FORETOPSAIL
THE SAME DAY I WENT ON BOARD WE SET SAIL STANDING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD UPON OUR OWN COAST WITH DESIGN TO STRETCH OVER FOR THE AFRICAN COAST WHEN WE CAME ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE DEGREES OF NORTHERN LATITUDE WHICH IT SEEMS WAS THE MANNER OF THEIR COURSE IN THOSE DAYS
SHUT THY EYES AND WHILE THOU ART ASLEEP GOD WILL CHANGE THY BAD FORTUNE INTO GOOD ONE OF THE NEGROES WHO UNDERSTOOD ARABIC HEARING ME SPEAK THUS CAME TOWARD ME AND SAID
THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN PROVOKED AT THIS OBSTINATE REFUSAL FLEW INTO A PASSION THREW A LITTLE OF HIS INCENSE INTO THE FIRE AND PRONOUNCED TWO MAGICAL WORDS WHEN THE STONE WHICH HAD CLOSED THE MOUTH OF THE STAIRCASE MOVED INTO ITS PLACE WITH THE EARTH OVER IT IN THE SAME MANNER AS IT LAY AT THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAGICIAN AND ALADDIN
I FOLLOWED THE SOUND
AND HE COULD NOT GUESS THE REASON OF MY QUESTION
WHEN THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN DRAWN THE SULTAN ASKED ALADDIN IF HE WOULD STAY IN THE PALACE AND COMPLETE THE CEREMONIES OF THE MARRIAGE THAT DAY
FOR THE LUSTS PLEASURES AND PROFITS OF THIS WORLD
AND THUS I LEFT THE ISLAND THE 19TH OF DECEMBER AS I FOUND BY THE SHIP'S ACCOUNT IN THE YEAR 1686 AFTER I HAD BEEN UPON IT EIGHT-AND-TWENTY YEARS TWO MONTHS AND NINETEEN DAYS
YOU SHALL TAKE WITH YOU MONEY ENOUGH TO PAY HIS DEBT TWENTY TIMES OVER BUT WHEN HER NEWLY-MADE HUSBAND HAD GONE PORTIA WENT AFTER HIM AND ARRIVED IN VENICE DISGUISED AS A LAWYER AND WITH AN INTRODUCTION FROM A CELEBRATED LAWYER BELLARIO WHOM THE DUKE OF VENICE HAD CALLED IN TO DECIDE THE LEGAL QUESTIONS RAISED BY SHYLOCK'S CLAIM TO A POUND OF ANTONIO'S FLESH
MECHANICALLY I LAID MYSELF DOWN FLAT IN THE SLEDGE AND LET MY HORSE RUN FOR OUR SAFETY
I DID THE SAME
THERE LIES MY GAGE SHE TOOK HER EMBROIDERED GLOVE FROM HER HAND AND FLUNG IT DOWN BEFORE THE GRAND MASTER WITH AN AIR OF MINGLED SIMPLICITY AND DIGNITY WHICH EXCITED UNIVERSAL SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
WHICH HE READILY COMPLIED WITH
THEN THEY TOOK HIM UP AND CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE AIR TO THE DOOR THAT I SAW IN THE SIDE OF THE HILL AND PUT HIM IN THERE
AS SOON AS WE DREW NEAR WE WERE ENCOMPASSED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF NEGROES WHO SEIZED US SHARED US AMONG THEM AND CARRIED US TO THEIR RESPECTIVE HABITATIONS
BY MAKING LARGE PROMISES TO HATTERAICK HE INDUCED THE SMUGGLER TO AGREE TO COME BY NIGHT WITH A LARGE BODY OF HIS MEN TO THE PRISON WHERE BERTRAM WOULD BE CONFINED FOR HIS ATTACK ON HAZLEWOOD AND TO BREAK OPEN THE DOORS AND CARRY HIM OFF
THEY WERE IN FACT ON THE WAY TO WOODBOURNE FOR THE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN SENT BY COLONEL MANNERING AFTER HE HAD READ THE LETTER WHICH THE DOMINIE BROUGHT HIM FROM MEG MERRILIES
DINMONT ADDED THAT HE HAD RIDDEN SIXTY MILES THAT DAY TO COME TO HIS ASSISTANCE
HIS WIFE HAD BROUGHT HIM A LITTLE MONEY WHEN HE MARRIED
AND WHEN HE SHALL SIT UPON THE THRONE OF JUDGMENT YOU SHALL SIT BY HIM
BUT HE MET WITH NO OTHER AFFRONT FROM APOLLYON QUITE THROUGH THIS VALLEY
THE NEXT NIGHT WE DETERMINED TO REVENGE OURSELVES ON THE BRUTISH GIANT AND DID SO IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
HIS EARS RESEMBLED THOSE OF AN ELEPHANT AND COVERED HIS SHOULDERS
THIS FILLED ME WITH HORROR AND I ADVANCED SOME STEPS TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE SEA
I MADE HER A LOW BOW TOOK OUT MY KNIFE AND FORK AND FELL TO EAT WHICH GAVE THEM EXCEEDING DELIGHT
I MIGHT HAVE RAISED SHIP-LOADINGS OF CORN BUT I HAD NO USE FOR IT
I TOOK UP THE VESSEL WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IN BOTH HANDS AND IN A MOST RESPECTFUL MANNER DRANK TO HER LADYSHIP'S HEALTH EXPRESSING THE WORDS AS LOUD AS I COULD IN ENGLISH WHICH MADE THE COMPANY LAUGH SO HEARTILY THAT I WAS ALMOST DEAFENED WITH THE NOISE
READ IT SO IF YOU WILL IN MY BOOK
IT IS A TALISMAN AGAINST ALL EVIL SO LONG AS YOU OBEY ME
BE CONTENT GOOD NEIGHBORS AND GO ALONG WITH ME
THE HORSES OF THE ARMY AND THOSE OF THE ROYAL STABLES HAVING BEEN DAILY LED BEFORE ME WERE NO LONGER SHY BUT WOULD COME UP TO MY VERY FEET WITHOUT STARTING THE RIDERS WOULD LEAP THEM OVER MY HAND AS I HELD IT ON THE GROUND AND ONE OF THE EMPEROR'S HUNTSMEN UPON A LARGE COURSER TOOK MY FOOT SHOE AND ALL
WHILE THEIR COMMANDS WERE OFTEN DROWNED IN THE CLASHING OF ARMOUR OR THE CLAMOUROUS SHOUTS OF THOSE WHOM THEY ADDRESSED
RASPE ILLUSTRATIONS AND I WILL WIND THEE IN MY ARMS A MIDSUMMER-NIGHT'S DREAM FRONTISPIECE ILLUSTRATION IN COLOR FROM THE PAINTING BY ARTHUR RACKHAM DISGUISED AS A TRAVELLER AND A STRANGER ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES FROM THE PAINTING BY EDMUND DULAC HE DESIRED I WOULD STAND LIKE A COLOSSUS GULLIVER AT THE COURT OF LILLIPUT FROM THE PAINTING BY ARTHUR RACKHAM THEY WERE VERY TIRED WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE FOREST OF ARDEN AS YOU LIKE IT FROM THE PAINTING BY CHARLES FOLKARD CHRISTIAN NIMBLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR HIS SWORD CHRISTIAN'S FIGHT WITH THE MONSTER APOLLYON FROM THE ETCHING BY WILLIAM STRANG PREFACE CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY WE ARE INFLUENCED BY THE CHARACTERS WE ADMIRE
HE RUSHED TO THE DOOR AND NO SOONER SAW THE DOOR OPEN THAN HE RAN OUT AND THREW THE LEADER DOWN BUT COULD NOT ESCAPE THE OTHER ROBBERS WHO WITH THEIR CIMETERS SOON DEPRIVED HIM OF LIFE
THIS THEY ALL ENGAGED TO DO AND ENTERED INTO WRITINGS OR COVENANTS TO DO SO
HE WAS MUCH PLEASED THAT HE STOPPED AT THIS PLACE
A FEW OF GLOSSIN'S MEN WERE NOW SEEN APPROACHING UP THE SLOPE WHEREUPON HE IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE AND TONE TOWARDS BERTRAM
THEY SAW THE SHIPS MOVE FORWARD IN A LARGE HALF-MOON BUT COULD NOT DISCERN ME WHO WAS UP TO MY BREAST IN WATER
WHETHER I WENT OVER BY THE LADDER AS FIRST CONTRIVED OR WENT IN AT THE HOLE IN THE ROCK WHICH I HAD CALLED A DOOR I CANNOT REMEMBER
CHARLES HAZLEWOOD WHO NOW FELT CERTAIN SOME DIABOLICAL PLOT WAS ON FOOT FOR THE MURDER OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCIDENTALLY WOUNDED HIM RODE BACK AT ONCE TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE
SO WILL IT BE WITH ALL SUCH MEN AT THE END OF THIS WORLD
I COULD NOT MODERATE MY JOY WHEN I FOUND MYSELF DELIVERED FROM THE DANGER I HAVE MENTIONED
SHE SAID AS SHE HANDED IT TO HIM
OTHER WITNESSES CAME FORWARD TO PROVE THAT REBECCA'S CURES WERE ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF MUTTERINGS IN AN UNKNOWN TONGUE AND SONGS OF A SWEET STRANGE SOUND WHICH MADE THE EARS OF THE HEARER TINGLE AND HIS HEART THROB ADDING THAT HER GARMENTS WERE OF A STRANGE AND MYSTIC FORM AND THAT SHE HAD RINGS IMPRESSED WITH CABALISTIC DEVICES ALL WHICH WERE IN THOSE IGNORANT AND SUPERSTITIOUS TIMES EASILY CREDITED AS PROOFS OF GUILT
FOR EXAMPLE IF I WANTED A BOARD I HAD NO OTHER WAY BUT TO CUT DOWN A TREE SET IT ON AN EDGE BEFORE ME AND HEW IT FLAT ON EITHER SIDE WITH MY AXE TILL I BROUGHT IT TO BE THIN AS A PLANK AND THEN DUB IT SMOOTH WITH MY ADZE
HE MENTIONED IT IN A VERY ARTFUL MANNER AT COUNCIL WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT SOME OF THE WISEST APPEARED AT LEAST BY THEIR SILENCE TO BE OF MY OPINION
MORGIANA WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO OBEY HER MASTER COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT HIS STRANGE ORDER
I PERCEIVED IN THIS DEVICE THE MEANS OF MY DELIVERANCE
THIS MADE ME REFLECT HOW VAIN AN ATTEMPT IT IS FOR A MAN TO ENDEAVOR TO DO HIMSELF HONOR AMONG THOSE WHO ARE OUT OF ALL DEGREE OF EQUALITY OR COMPARISON WITH HIM
AND SHORTLY AFTER THE TWO RETREATED HURRIEDLY FROM THE LISTS
BUT I THAT WAS BORN TO BE MY OWN DESTROYER COULD NO MORE RESIST THE OFFER THAN I COULD RESTRAIN MY FIRST RAMBLING DESIGNS WHEN MY FATHER'S GOOD COUNSEL WAS LOST UPON ME
I TOOK PLEASURE IN LOOKING UPON THEM
I TOLD THE EMPEROR THAT MY GOOD FORTUNE HAD THROWN THIS BOAT IN MY WAY TO CARRY ME TO SOME PLACE FROM WHENCE I MIGHT RETURN INTO MY NATIVE COUNTRY AND BEGGED HIS MAJESTY'S ORDERS FOR GETTING MATERIALS TO FIT IT UP TOGETHER WITH HIS LICENCE TO DEPART WHICH AFTER SOME KIND EXPOSTULATIONS HE WAS PLEASED TO GRANT
I WAS VERY MUCH TIRED AND DISPOSED TO SLEEP WHICH MY MISTRESS PERCEIVING SHE PUT ME ON HER OWN BED COVERED ME WITH A CLEAN WHITE HANDKERCHIEF BUT LARGER AND COARSER THAN THE MAINSAIL OF A MAN-OF-WAR
THE SERVANTS RAN FOR LADDERS
THE MERCHANTS AT THIS TIME RUN TO THEIR NESTS DISTURB AND DRIVE OFF THE EAGLES BY THEIR SHOUTS AND TAKE AWAY THE DIAMONDS THAT STICK TO THE MEAT
WHO IS THIS STRANGE MAN SAID SHE WHO EATS NO SALT WITH HIS MEAT
I STAYED BUT TWO MONTHS WITH MY WIFE AND FAMILY
HER APPEARANCE WAS ALTOGETHER OF SO STRANGE A KIND THAT IT MADE MANNERING START
I DID NOT STAY ON THE HILL BUT TURNED TOWARD THE CITY
THAT THE MOST I COULD SUGGEST ANY DANGER FROM WAS FROM ANY CASUAL ACCIDENTAL LANDING OF STRAGGLING PEOPLE FROM THE MAIN WHO AS IT WAS LIKELY IF THEY WERE DRIVEN HITHER WERE HERE AGAINST THEIR WILLS SO THEY MADE NO STAY HERE BUT WENT OFF AGAIN WITH ALL POSSIBLE SPEED
ONE DAY WHEN THE WEATHER WAS EXCESSIVELY HOT HE WAS EMPLOYED TO CARRY A HEAVY BURDEN FROM ONE END OF THE TOWN TO THE OTHER
THEN THEY KNOCKED OFF SOME OF THE BOARDS FOR THE USE OF THE SHIP AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT ALL THEY HAD A MIND FOR LET THE HULL DROP INTO THE SEA WHICH BY REASON OF MANY BREACHES MADE IN THE BOTTOM AND SIDES SUNK OUTRIGHT
THE TROOP WHO WERE TO THE NUMBER OF FORTY ALL WELL MOUNTED AND ARMED CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE ROCK ON WHICH THE TREE STOOD AND THERE DISMOUNTED
THEREFORE IT IS SAID OF DIVES IN THY LIFETIME THOU RECEIVEDST THY GOOD THINGS AND LIKEWISE LAZARTIS EVIL THINGS
BUT HE WAS A YOUNG KNIGHT OF LESSER RENOWN AND LOWER RANK SIR PALMER SAID BRIAN DE BOIS-GUILBERT SCORNFULLY THIS ASSUMED FORGETFULNESS AFTER SO MUCH HAS BEEN REMEMBERED COMES TOO LATE TO SERVE YOUR PURPOSE
I SLEPT NONE THAT NIGHT
IN THE MEANTIME I WAS NOT ABLE TO FORBEAR GROANING AND SHEDDING TEARS AND TURNING MY HEAD TOWARD MY SIDES
HE WAS ACTIVELY ASSISTED IN HIS ENDEAVOURS AGAINST THEM BY THE SAME FRANK KENNEDY WHO HAD CARRIED OUT THE EVICTION OF MEG MERRILIES AND HER COMPANIONS AND THE SMUGGLERS HAD SWORN TO BE REVENGED UPON THEIR ENEMY
GENIE SAID ALADDIN CONVEY ME AT ONCE TO A BATH AND SUPPLY ME WITH THE RICHEST AND MOST MAGNIFICENT ROBE EVER WORN BY A MONARCH NO SOONER WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH THAN THE GENIE RENDERED HIM AS WELL AS HIMSELF INVISIBLE AND TRANSPORTED HIM INTO A HUMMUM OF THE FINEST MARBLE OF ALL SORTS OF COLORS WHERE HE WAS UNDRESSED WITHOUT SEEING BY WHOM IN A MAGNIFICENT AND SPACIOUS HALL
AND SHORTLY AFTER A GRAND FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL OF PRINCE JOHN AND HIS GORGEOUS RETINUE
AND THE JEW NOTICED WITH AMAZEMENT THAT THE PALMER APPEARED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH EVERY PATH AND OUTLET OF THE WOOD
BUT IF IT DOES IT SHALL BE SUPPLIED PRINCESS SAID THE FALSE FATIMA WITH GREAT DISSIMULATION FORGIVE ME THE LIBERTY I HAVE TAKEN
ON RETURNING TO THE NEW HOUSE AT ELLANGOWAN MANNERING LEARNED FROM MR BERTRAM THAT THIS DIRCK HATTERAICK WAS THE TERROR OF ALL THE EXCISE AND CUSTOM-HOUSE CRUISERS WITH WHICH HE HAD HAD MANY A FIERCE FIGHT
WHOSE FEET PRESS DOWN TO THE CENTRE AND WHOSE HEAD STRIKES AGAINST THE SUN
NEITHER COULD I BE SAID TO WANT ANYTHING BUT SOCIETY
NOW BY THIS TIME THE MAN WAS GOT A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THEM
THE LUSTRE OF THEIR JEWELLED GIRDLES AND THE BRILLIANCY OF THE AIGRETTES OF PRECIOUS STONES IN THEIR TURBANS EXCITED THE GREATEST ADMIRATION IN THE SPECTATORS
THIS SORE COMBAT LASTED FOR ABOVE HALF A DAY EVEN TILL CHRISTIAN WAS ALMOST QUITE SPENT
ACCORDINGLY ON THE DAY OF THE AUCTION HE MADE HIS WAY TO ELLANGOWAN HOUSE WHERE HE WAS TOLD ON INQUIRY THAT THE OLD LAIRD WAS DANGEROUSLY ILL AND WAS TO BE FOUND UP AT THE RUINED CASTLE IN COMPANY WITH HIS DAUGHTER
IS THERE NO HELP
CONSTABLES WERE SENT OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION TO SEARCH FOR HIM AND GLOSSIN TOOK CARE TO SEND THEM TO PLACES WHERE THEY WOULD BE LEAST LIKELY TO FIND HIM
HAVING WAITED A GOOD WHILE LISTENING TO HEAR IF THEY MADE ANY NOISE AT LENGTH BEING VERY IMPATIENT I SET MY GUNS AT THE FOOT OF MY LADDER AND CLAMBERED UP TO THE TOP OF THE HILL BY MY TWO STAGES AS USUAL
HE THEREFORE TOOK COUNSEL WITH HIS VIZIER WHO SUGGESTED THAT THE SULTAN SHOULD ATTACH SUCH CONDITIONS TO THE MARRIAGE THAT NO ONE IN THE HUMBLE CONDITION OF ALADDIN COULD POSSIBLY FULFIL
THE SULTAN ON HEARING THESE STRANGE TIDINGS CONSULTED WITH THE GRAND VIZIER
I ANSWERED THAT I UNDERSTOOD BOTH VERY WELL
THEIR WAY LAY THROUGH A THICKLY-WOODED COUNTRY WHICH WAS AT THE TIME HELD TO BE DANGEROUS TO TRAVELLERS FROM THE NUMBER OF OUTLAWS WHOM OPPRESSION AND POVERTY HAD DRIVEN TO DESPAIR AND WHO OCCUPIED THE FORESTS IN LARGE BANDS
THE MONKEY WAS KILLED AND AN ORDER MADE THAT NO SUCH ANIMAL SHOULD BE KEPT ABOUT THE PALACE
WE REJOICED YESTERDAY AT HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE CRUELTY OF A GIANT AND THE RAGE OF THE WAVES NOW ARE WE FALLEN INTO ANOTHER DANGER EQUALLY DREADFUL AS WE WALKED ABOUT WE SAW A LARGE TALL TREE UPON WHICH WE DESIGNED TO PASS THE FOLLOWING NIGHT FOR OUR SECURITY
IT WAS AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THAT A JEW HAD BEEN TO SEEK THE KNIGHT AND THAT AFTER A VERY BRIEF CONFERENCE HE HAD CALLED FOR GURTH AND HIS ARMOUR AND HAD LEFT THE CASTLE
WHETHER ON THE CONTINENT OR ON AN ISLAND
THE CROWD AND THE NOISE WAS SO GREAT THAT THE PRINCESS WHO WAS IN THE HALL OF FOUR-AND-TWENTY WINDOWS HEARD IT AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WHILE ALI BABA WAS BURYING THE GOLD HIS WIFE TO SHOW HER EXACTNESS AND DILIGENCE TO HER SISTER-IN-LAW CARRIED THE MEASURE BACK AGAIN BUT WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE THAT A PIECE OF GOLD HAD STUCK TO THE BOTTOM
I DOUBTED NOT BUT THAT THIS WAS THE BURIAL-PLACE OF THE ELEPHANTS AND THAT THEY CARRIED ME THITHER ON PURPOSE TO TELL ME THAT I SHOULD FORBEAR TO KILL THEM AS NOW I KNEW WHERE TO GET THEIR TEETH WITHOUT INFLICTING INJURY ON THEM
THAT THEY WOULD OWN HIM AS A FATHER TO THEM AS LONG AS THEY LIVED
DO THY WORST
YOUR WORTHY FATHER WAS MY OWN BROTHER
OUT OF THE WAY WE WENT AND THEN WE FOUND WHAT TWAS TO TREAD UPON FORBIDDEN GROUND
ONE IS BLUE THE OTHER RED AND THE THIRD GREEN
ALL STOOD ASTONISHED AT HIS PRESUMPTION BUT NONE MORE THAN THE REDOUBTED KNIGHT WHOM HE HAD THUS DEFIED TO MORTAL COMBAT
WHEN GLOSSIN THE ATTORNEY FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE GOT OUT OF HIS CLIENT IN THE WAY OF MONEY HE COMMENCED OPENLY TO SHOW THE WICKEDNESS OF HIS BAD AND CRUEL NATURE
BUT HE HAD SCARCE UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND ATHELSTANE ARRAYED IN THE GARMENTS OF THE GRAVE STOOD BEFORE THEM PALE HAGGARD AND LIKE SOMETHING ARISEN FROM THE DEAD
THE CAPITAL OF SERENDIB STANDS AT THE END OF A FINE VALLEY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND ENCOMPASSED BY HIGH MOUNTAINS
AND HE HOPED IN A FEW WEEKS BOTH EMPIRES WOULD BE FREED FROM SO INSUPPORTABLE AN ENCUMBRANCE
I THEN TOOK THE PURSE AND OPENING IT POURED ALL THE GOLD INTO HIS PALM
BUT TWAS THE DREADFULLEST SIGHT THAT EVER I SAW
BUT I WAS HURRIED ON AND OBEYED BLINDLY THE DICTATES OF MY FANCY RATHER THAN MY REASON
ONLY THAT I KEPT MYSELF AND ONE MORE OUT OF SIGHT FOR REASONS OF STATE
FOR NEVER MAN HAD A MORE FAITHFUL LOVING SINCERE SERVANT THAN FRIDAY WAS TO ME
THAT AS I LIVED QUITE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO SIMPLE AS TO LEAVE A MARK IN A PLACE WHERE IT WAS TEN THOUSAND TO ONE WHETHER I SHOULD EVER SEE IT OR NOT AND IN THE SAND TOO WHICH THE FIRST SURGE OF THE SEA UPON A HIGH WIND WOULD HAVE DEFACED ENTIRELY
BUT HE HAS BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME AT THESE WORDS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THREW HIS ARMS ABOUT ALADDIN'S NECK AND KISSED HIM SEVERAL TIMES WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND SAID I AM YOUR UNCLE
AND FIRST I FOUND THAT ALL THE SHIP'S PROVISIONS WERE DRY AND UNTOUCHED BY THE WATER AND BEING VERY WELL DISPOSED TO EAT I WENT TO THE BREAD-ROOM AND FILLED MY POCKETS WITH BISCUIT AND ATE IT AS I WENT ABOUT OTHER THINGS FOR I HAD NO TIME TO LOSE
IN THIS ORDER THE PRINCESS CONVEYED IN HER LITTER AND ACCOMPANIED ALSO BY ALADDIN'S MOTHER CARRIED IN A SUPERB LITTER AND ATTENDED BY HER WOMEN SLAVES PROCEEDED ON THE CARPET WHICH WAS SPREAD FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO THAT OF ALADDIN
GIVE ME MY THREE THOUSAND DUCATS THAT I LENT HIM AND LET HIM GO BASSANIO WOULD HAVE PAID IT TO HIM BUT SAID PORTIA NO
THE LADDERS WERE NOW APPLIED AND MOUNTED BY SEVERAL MEN
AND THEN THE KNIGHTS WHISPERED TO EACH OTHER THAT IT WAS TIME TO DECLARE THE PLEDGE OF REBECCA FORFEITED
FOR I POSSESSED INFINITELY MORE THAN I KNEW WHAT TO DO WITH
HOWEVER WITH WHATEVER INTENTION IT WAS DONE IT IS ADVISABLE TO GUARD AGAINST THE WORST ACCORDINGLY SHE FETCHED A PIECE OF CHALK AND MARKED TWO OR THREE DOORS ON EACH SIDE IN THE SAME MANNER WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO HER MASTER OR MISTRESS
OBERON WAS SORRY FOR POOR HELENA AND WHEN PUCK RETURNED WITH THE FLOWER HE BADE HIM FOLLOW DEMETRIUS AND PUT SOME OF THE JUICE ON HIS EYES SO THAT HE MIGHT LOVE HELENA WHEN HE WOKE AND LOOKED ON HER AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED HIM
I CHOOSE THE LEAD CASKET
WITNESSES SKILLED IN MEDICINE WERE THEN BROUGHT FORWARD TO PROVE THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATERIALS OF WHICH THE UNGUENT WAS COMPOUNDED AND WHO SUGGESTED THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BY MEANS BOTH UNLAWFUL AND MAGICAL
BUT HE CONSIDERING THAT HE SHOULD THEN BE OBLIGED TO SHOW HIS FACE WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS TAKEN CARE TO CONCEAL WITH FATIMA'S VEIL AND FEARING THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE WAS NOT FATIMA BEGGED OF HER EARNESTLY TO EXCUSE HIM TELLING HER THAT HE NEVER ATE ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND DRIED FRUITS AND DESIRING TO EAT THAT SLIGHT REPAST IN HIS OWN APARTMENT
THE BUILDING OF THE BOAT BY DANIEL DEFOE HAVING NOW BROUGHT MY MIND A LITTLE TO RELISH MY CONDITION AND GIVEN OVER LOOKING OUT TO SEA TO SEE IF I COULD SPY A SHIP--I SAY GIVING OVER THESE THINGS I BEGAN TO APPLY MYSELF TO ARRANGE MY WAY OF LIVING AND TO MAKE THINGS AS EASY TO ME AS I COULD
THEN THE MASTER MADE ME A SIGN TO COME TO HIS TRENCHER SIDE
AS HE WALKS THE SAID ROADS HE SHALL TAKE THE UTMOST CARE RIOT TO TRAMPLE UPON THE BODIES OF ANY OF OUR LOVING SUBJECTS THEIR HORSES OR CARRIAGES NOR TAKE ANY OF OUR SUBJECTS INTO HIS HANDS WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
DEPART
AND NOW IT WAS THAT I BEGAN TO KEEP A JOURNAL OF EVERY DAY'S EMPLOYMENT
AT LENGTH STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE I HAD THE FORTUNE TO BREAK THE STRINGS AND WRENCH OUT THE PEGS THAT FASTENED MY LEFT ARM TO THE GROUND
DURING THIS INTERVAL ALADDIN FREQUENTED THE SHOPS OF THE PRINCIPAL MERCHANTS WHERE THEY SOLD CLOTH OF GOLD AND SILVER LINENS SILK STUFFS AND JEWELRY AND OFTENTIMES JOINING IN THEIR CONVERSATION ACQUIRED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AND A DESIRE TO IMPROVE HIMSELF
AND WOULD OFTEN SLEEP IN MY HAMMOCK WHILE WE WERE UPON THE ROAD
THEY WERE VERY TIRED WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE FOREST OF ARDEN AND AS THEY WERE SITTING ON THE GRASS A COUNTRYMAN PASSED THAT WAY AND GANYMEDE ASKED HIM IF HE COULD GET THEM FOOD
AFTER HAVING PASSED THE NIGHT IN THIS CONDITION THE BIRD FLEW AWAY AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT AND CARRIED ME SO HIGH THAT I COULD NOT DISCERN THE EARTH
THE DUNGEON OCCUPIED BY ISAAC OF YORK WAS DARK AND DAMP
WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY WORK I DESIRED THE EMPEROR TO LET A TROOP OF HIS BEST HORSE TWENTY-FOUR IN NUMBER COME AND EXERCISE UPON THIS PLAIN
HERE THEN THEY LAY FROM WEDNESDAY MORNING TILL SATURDAY NIGHT WITHOUT ONE BIT OF BREAD OR DROP OF DRINK OR LIGHT OR ANY TO ASK HOW THEY DID
THIS OPEN BOLD DECLARATION OF MINE WAS SO OPPOSITE TO THE SCHEMES AND POLITICS OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THAT HE COULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
AND IT WILL BE SEEN AT LENGTH THAT THEY WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT JUST REASON
DO NOT BE UNEASY
MY BEARD I HAD ONCE SUFFERED TO GROW TILL IT WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF A YARD LONG
GULLIVER AT THE COURT OF LILLIPUT BY JONATHAN SWIFT MY GENTLENESS AND GOOD BEHAVIOR HAD GAINED SO FAR ON THE EMPEROR AND HIS COURT AND INDEED UPON THE ARMY AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL THAT I BEGAN TO CONCEIVE HOPES OF GETTING MY LIBERTY IN A SHORT TIME
HE THREW OFF HIS TURBAN PULLED HIS BEARD AND BEAT HIS HEAD LIKE A MADMAN
I COULD MAKE NO MORE USE OF THEM BUT FOR FUEL AND THAT I HAD NO OCCASION FOR BUT TO DRESS MY FOOD
IF THOU SHALT ATTEMPT TO DIMINISH BY ONE STEP THE DISTANCE NOW BETWEEN US THOU SHALT SEE THAT THE JEWISH MAIDEN WILL RATHER TRUST HER SOUL WITH GOD THAN HER HONOUR TO THE TEMPLAR AS SHE SPOKE THE BUGLE WAS HEARD TO SOUND ANNOUNCING THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE KNIGHT WAS REQUIRED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CASTLE
OTHERS SO FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY HIM AS WELL AS WE AND YET HAVE ESCAPED OUT OF HIS HAND
IN THIS DISTRESS THE WIND STILL BLOWING VERY HARD ONE OF OUR MEN EARLY ONE MORNING CRIED OUT LAND AND WE HAD NO SOONER RUN OUT OF THE CABIN TO LOOK OUT IN HOPES OF SEEING WHEREABOUT IN THE WORLD WE WERE THAN THE SHIP STRUCK UPON THE SAND AND IN A MOMENT HER MOTION BEING SO STOPPED THE SEA BROKE OVER HER IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE EXPECTED WE SHOULD ALL HAVE PERISHED IMMEDIATELY
BUT I MUST TELL YOU I SHALL BLINDFOLD YOU WHEN YOU COME TO SUCH A PLACE BABA MUSTAPHA SEEMED TO HESITATE A LITTLE AT THESE WORDS
MY HOSPITALITY MUST NOT BE BOUNDED BY YOUR DISLIKES
BIDE BEHIND IT FOR A SPACE TILL I SAY THE HOUR AND THE MAN ARE BOTH COME
ON CONSENTING TO PAY THIS AMOUNT TO THE PRIOR OF JORVAULX WHO HAD JUST THEN JOINED THE PARTY IN THE WOOD THE JEW WAS GIVEN A LETTER WRITTEN BY THE PRIOR HIMSELF DIRECTED TO BOIS-GUILBERT AT THE PRECEPTORY OF TEMPLESTOWE WHITHER THE MAIDEN HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF COMMANDING THAT REBECCA SHOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY
BUT HE THAT HATH HIS PORTION LAST MUST HAVE IT LASTINGLY
AND SOON AFTER I BEGAN TO FANCY THAT THE BOX WAS PULLED OR TOWED ALONG THE SEA
BUT THE GROUND IN THAT COUNTRY BEING EXTREMELY SMOOTH AND LEVEL IT RECEIVED LESS DAMAGE THAN I EXPECTED
COLONEL MANNERING WHO HAD BEEN FROM HOME FOR SOME DAYS RETURNED TO WOODBOURNE THE NIGHT OF THE DAY ON WHICH BERTRAM HAD BEEN SENT TO PRISON
NOT LONG AFTER MORGIANA WHOSE EYES NOTHING COULD ESCAPE WENT OUT AND SEEING THE RED CHALK AND ARGUING WITH HERSELF AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE MARKED THE OTHER NEIGHBORS HOUSES IN THE SAME PLACE AND MANNER
THE QUEEN WHO OFTEN USED TO HEAR ME TALK OF MY SEA-VOYAGES AND TOOK ALL OCCASIONS TO DIVERT ME WHEN I WAS MELANCHOLY ASKED ME WHETHER I UNDERSTOOD HOW TO HANDLE A SAIL OR AN OAR AND WHETHER A LITTLE EXERCISE OF ROWING MIGHT NOT BE CONVENIENT FOR MY HEALTH
ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN OF WHOM THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OUT WAS A DARK-FEATURED MAN RESEMBLING A GIPSY IN HIS APPEARANCE
AND WE HAD INDEED SECURED THEM EFFECTUALLY
THEN HE FALLS UPON THEM AND BEATS THEM FEARFULLY IN SUCH SORT THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP THEMSELVES OR TO TURN THEM UPON THE FLOOR
ELIOT LL.D
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY ASKED PORTIA OF THE MERCHANT
THEY PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING WHO WAS A GOOD PRINCE
IS IT NOT REASONABLE THAT AFTER ALL THIS I SHOULD ENJOY A QUIET AND PLEASANT LIFE AS HE SAID THESE WORDS HINDBAD KISSED HIS HAND AND SAID SIR MY AFFLICTIONS ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH YOURS
THEY SEEMED QUITE NEAR AND YET I COULD SEE NO TRACE OF A HUMAN BEING
THOU ART A SAXON FATHER SHE SAID TO HIM
SHE IN VERY PITY WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM IN HIS HARD WORK BUT HE WOULD NOT LET HER YET HE COULD NOT KEEP FROM HER THE SECRET OF HIS LOVE AND SHE HEARING IT REJOICED AND PROMISED TO BE HIS WIFE
YOU SPOIL EVERYTHING WITH YOUR QUARRELING
SO THAT THE VERY SIGHT WAS TO THEM THAT COULD BEHOLD IT AS IF HEAVEN ITSELF WAS COME DOWN TO MEET THEM
SO THEY CONTINUED TOGETHER IN THE DARK THAT DAY IN THEIR SAD AND DOLEFUL CONDITION
IT WAS THE FOURTH OF JUNE THE KING'S BIRTHDAY
IT WAS ALSO SAID TO THE SAME PERSONS GATHER MY WHEAT INTO THE GARNER
THE NEXT MORNING THE ATTENDANTS OF ALADDIN PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO DRESS HIM AND BROUGHT HIM ANOTHER HABIT AS RICH AND MAGNIFICENT AS THAT WORN THE DAY BEFORE
FOR THE SHORE LAY SO HIGH THAT AT THE UPPER END IT MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWENTY FEET DEEP
YE FROZEN VIPER THAT I WARMED TILL YE STUNG ME
BUT HE SEEMED TO BE WHOLLY IGNORANT WHAT THEY WERE
OF THESE MUSTACHIOS OR WHISKERS I WILL NOT SAY THEY WERE LONG ENOUGH TO HANG MY HAT UPON THEM BUT THEY WERE OF A LENGTH AND SHAPE MONSTROUS ENOUGH AND SUCH AS IN ENGLAND WOULD HAVE PASSED FOR FRIGHTFUL
DO SO SAID PROSPERO AND IN TWO DAYS I WILL DISCHARGE THEE THEN HE BADE ARIEL TAKE THE FORM OF A WATER NYMPH AND SENT HIM IN SEARCH OF THE YOUNG PRINCE
HIS MAJESTY APPROVED OF THE PROPOSAL AND I TOOK THEM UP ONE BY ONE IN MY HANDS READY MOUNTED AND ARMED WITH THE PROPER OFFICERS TO EXERCISE THEM
THE DISLIKE RIPENED AFTER SOME TIME INTO AN OPEN QUARREL FOLLOWED BY A DUEL BETWEEN THE COLONEL AND HIS SUBALTERN IN WHICH AFTER EXCHANGING SHOTS MANNERING BELIEVED HE KILLED HIS ADVERSARY
FOR YOU MAY BE SURE MY FIRST WORK WAS TO SEARCH AND TO SEE WHAT WAS SPOILED AND WHAT WAS FREE
ONE OF WHICH WAS A MASTIFF EQUAL IN BULK TO FOUR ELEPHANTS AND A GREYHOUND SOMEWHAT TALLER THAN THE MASTIFF BUT NOT SO LARGE
THOUGH THEY COST ME INFINITE LABOR TOO
YET HERE I DWELT TILL AGE PREMATURE AGE HAS STAMPED ITS GHASTLY FEATURES ON MY COUNTENANCE SCORNED AND INSULTED WHERE I WAS ONCE OBEYED
THE LATE DONALD G
HE HAD LEFT THE LISTS IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE CONFLICT CEASED AND HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY SOME SPECTATORS TO MOVE SLOWLY DOWN ONE OF THE FOREST GLADES
SIRE SAID THE SULTANESS I WILL GO AND SEE HER
I WAS AT THE PAINS OF MAKING ROPES AND CABLES BY TWISTING TEN TWENTY OR THIRTY OF THE THICKEST AND STRONGEST OF THEIRS
THEN SAD THE OTHER DO YOU SEE YONDER SHINING LIGHT
HE LED THE SULTAN INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT
I LEAVE THE MATTER TO YOUR WIT AND SKILFUL DEVICES ALI BABA HELPED TO PLACE THE BODY IN CASSIM'S HOUSE AGAIN RECOMMENDED TO MORGIANA TO ACT HER PART WELL AND THEN RETURNED WITH HIS ASS
SO GIVE YOUR PROMISE AND MIND THAT YOU OWE YOUR LIFE TO ME THIS BLESSED NIGHT WHEN BROWN HAD PROMISED SHE PARTED FROM HIM AND WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT
FOR TWELVE YEARS BUNYAN WAS LOCKED UP IN THE LITTLE JAIL AT THE END OF THE BRIDGE AT BEDFORD
THE EFFECT OF THIS APPARITION ON THE PERSONS PRESENT WAS UTTERLY APPALLING
THE AVERAGE READER DOES NOT CONCENTRATE SUFFICIENTLY TO GET THE THOUGHT CLEARLY FROM THE TEXT AND DOES NOT IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDST OF THE SCENE HE IS DESCRIBING
RASPE MY FIRST VISIT TO ENGLAND WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF GEORGE THE THIRD'S REIGN
AND WE LAY STILL A LONG TIME VERY IRRESOLUTE WHAT COURSE TO TAKE
OUR NEXT WORK WAS TO REPAIR THE BOAT AND THINK OF SEIZING THE SHIP
BUT IT WAS ALL ONE
AND THEY PRESENTLY HEARD THEM AND ANSWERING RAN ALONG THE SHORE WESTWARD TOWARDS THE VOICE THEY HEARD WHEN THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE CREEK WHERE THE WATER BEING UP THEY COULD NOT GET OVER AND CALLED FOR THE BOAT TO COME UP AND SET THEM OVER
NO VILLAGE WAS TO BE SEEN
THE OTHERS REPEATED THE SAME WORDS SEVERAL TIMES BUT I THEN KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT
WHEN I HAD PERFORMED THESE WONDERS THEY SHOUTED FOR JOY AND DANCED UPON MY BREAST REPEATING SEVERAL TIMES AS THEY DID AT FIRST HEKINAH DEGUL THEY MADE ME A SIGN THAT I SHOULD THROW DOWN THE TWO HOGSHEADS BUT FIRST WARNING THE PEOPLE BELOW TO STAND OUT OF THE WAY CRYING ALOUD BORACH MEVOLAH AND WHEN THEY SAW THE VESSELS IN THE AIR THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL SHOUT OF HEKINAH DEGUL I CONFESS I WAS OFTEN TEMPTED WHILE THEY WERE PASSING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON MY BODY TO SEIZE FORTY OR FIFTY OF THE FIRST THAT CAME IN MY REACH AND DASH THEM AGAINST THE GROUND
BUT HERMIA'S FATHER WISHED HER TO MARRY ANOTHER MAN NAMED DEMETRIUS
IVANHOE AS THOU WELL KNOWEST IS UNABLE TO BEAR HIS CORSLET AND RICHARD IS IN A FOREIGN PRISON
GOOD BROTHER BE NOT OFFENDED
FOUR WASP STINGS LIKE JOINERS TACKS
I SECURED THE ENTRANCE WHICH WAS LOW AND NARROW WITH A GREAT STONE TO PRESERVE ME FROM THE SERPENTS BUT NOT SO FAR AS TO EXCLUDE THE LIGHT
THE FELLOW WAS AN INGENIOUS WORKMAN AND BY MY INSTRUCTIONS IN TEN DAYS FINISHED A PLEASURE-BOAT WITH ALL ITS TACKLING ABLE CONVENIENTLY TO HOLD EIGHT EUROPEANS
I HAD SO MUCH PRESENCE OF MIND AS WELL AS BREATH LEFT THAT SEEING MYSELF NEARER THE MAINLAND THAN I EXPECTED I GOT UPON MY FEET AND ENDEAVORED TO MAKE ON TOWARD THE LAND AS FAST AS I COULD BEFORE ANOTHER WAVE SHOULD RETURN AND TAKE ME UP AGAIN
WHEN HE HAD LOADED THEM WITH THE BAGS HE LAID WOOD OVER THEM IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEY COULD NOT BE SEEN
THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN OBSERVING IN ALADDIN'S COUNTENANCE SOMETHING WHICH ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS A FIT BOY FOR HIS PURPOSE INQUIRED HIS NAME AND HISTORY OF SOME OF HIS COMPANIONS
THOUGH THE PRESENT WE SEND YOU BE INCONSIDERABLE RECEIVE IT HOWEVER AS A BROTHER AND A FRIEND IN CONSIDERATION OF THE HEARTY FRIENDSHIP WHICH WE BEAR FOR YOU AND OF WHICH WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU PROOF
MY FEARS WERE NOT WITHOUT CAUSE
MADAM PRAY LOSE NO TIME
TAKE HOLD OF THE RING AND LIFT UP THAT STONE INDEED UNCLE REPLIED ALADDIN I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH
FOR SEEING SO MANY AND KNOWING THAT THEY ALWAYS CAME FOUR OR SIX OR SOMETIMES MORE IN A BOAT I COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO THINK OF IT OR HOW TO TAKE MY MEASURES TO ATTACK TWENTY OR THIRTY MEN SINGLE-HANDED
I BELIEVE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS TO THE LIFE WHAT THE ECSTASIES AND TRANSPORTS OF THE SOUL ARE WHEN IT IS SO SAVED AS I MAY SAY OUT OF THE VERY GRAVE
SO THAT IT WAS PLAIN THEY WERE GONE AND HAD LEFT THEIR TWO COMRADES BEHIND THEM WITHOUT ANY SEARCH AFTER THEM
HE WAS HORRIFIED TO HEAR FROM HIS FELLOW-SERVANT OF THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN THEIR MASTER AND HIS PARTY
WHEN SHE HAD THUS DISGUISED HERSELF SHE SAID TO ABDALLA TAKE YOUR TABOR AND LET US GO AND DIVERT OUR MASTER AND HIS SON'S FRIEND AS WE DO SOMETIMES WHEN HE IS ALONE ABDALLA TOOK HIS TABOR AND PLAYED ALL THE WAY INTO THE HALL BEFORE MORGIANA WHO WHEN SHE CAME TO THE DOOR MADE A LOW OBEISANCE BY WAY OF ASKING LEAVE TO EXHIBIT HER SKILL WHILE ABDALLA LEFT OFF PLAYING
THIS NIGHT THE GRAND VIZIER'S SON IS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR AT THIS ACCOUNT ALADDIN WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THE LAMP AND OF THE GENIE WHO HAD PROMISED TO OBEY HIM
BUT IT HAPPENED THERE WAS NO DANGER FOR THE CAT TOOK NOT THE LEAST NOTICE OF ME WHEN MY MASTER PLACED ME WITHIN THREE YARDS OF HER
THEY TOLD THE STRANGE TIDINGS TO THE GRAND VIZIER WHO INFORMED THE SULTAN WHO EXCLAIMED IT MUST BE ALADDIN'S PALACE WHICH I GAVE HIM LEAVE TO BUILD FOR MY DAUGHTER
THE OTHERS I ORDERED TO MY BOWER AS I CALLED IT OF WHICH I HAVE GIVEN A FULL DESCRIPTION
WHEN THIS WAS DONE AND ALL SAFE UPON DECK THE CAPTAIN ORDERED THE MATE WITH THREE MEN TO BREAK INTO THE ROUND-HOUSE WHERE THE NEW REBEL CAPTAIN LAY WHO HAVING TAKEN THE ALARM HAD GOT UP AND WITH TWO MEN AND A BOY HAD GOT FIRE-ARMS IN THEIR HANDS
MY WIFE FOUND THIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE YOU BORROWED YESTERDAY BY THIS DISCOURSE ALI BABA PERCEIVED THAT CASSIM AND HIS WIFE THROUGH HIS OWN WIFE'S FOLLY KNEW WHAT THEY HAD SO MUCH REASON TO CONCEAL
THE MAGICIAN PRESENTLY SET THEM ON FIRE
RISE MY FRIENDS SAID RICHARD
AND HERE I FOUND A FRESH RENEWING OF MY GRIEF
MY PIECE WAS ONLY CHARGED WITH SWAN-SHOT AND I HAD NO OTHER ABOUT ME
HE SAID THAT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NOON AS HE WAS LOOKING THROUGH HIS GLASS HE SPIED IT AT A DISTANCE AND THOUGHT IT WAS A SAIL WHICH HE HAD A MIND TO MAKE BEING NOT MUCH OUT OF HIS COURSE IN HOPES OF BUYING SOME BISCUIT HIS OWN BEGINNING TO FALL SHORT
BEFORE YOU ENTER THE FIRST HALL BE SURE TO TUCK UP YOUR ROBE WRAP IT ABOUT YOU AND THEN PASS THROUGH THE SECOND INTO THE THIRD WITHOUT STOPPING
BUT IT IS ORDINARY FOR THOSE THAT HAVE PROFESSED THEMSELVES HIS SERVANTS AFTER A WHILE TO GIVE HIM THE SLIP AND RETURN AGAIN TO ME
AND A MAN REELED AND FELL AT EVERY BLOW DELIVERED BY THE BLACK KNIGHT
AND AFTER A SHORT FIGHT THE TWO WOULD-BE MURDERERS OF THE FARMER WERE FLYING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES ACROSS THE HEATH PURSUED BY WASP
HE THEN LAID HIMSELF DOWN BESIDE HER PUTTING A DRAWN SCIMITAR BETWEEN THEM TO SHOW THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO SECURE HER SAFETY AND TO TREAT HER WITH THE UTMOST POSSIBLE RESPECT
YOU ARE GOING NOW SAID THEY TO THE PARADISE OF GOD WHEREIN YOU SHALL SEE THE TREE OF LIFE AND EAT OF THE NEVER-FADING FRUITS THEREOF
BUT BY THE DEXTERITY OF THE STEERSMAN IT MISSED US AND FELL INTO THE SEA
THE PRINCE ORDERED ME TO RISE RECEIVED ME WITH AN OBLIGING AIR AND MADE ME SIT DOWN NEAR HIM
HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT PERSONAL STRENGTH POSSESSED OF A HASTY AND CHOLERIC TEMPER BUT HE HAD SHREWDLY REFRAINED FROM SHOWING ANY OPEN HOSTILITY TO THE SUCCESSORS OF THE CONQUEROR
ALADDIN SLEPT VERY SOUNDLY TILL LATE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER WAS THAT HE WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT AND WISHED SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HIS BREAKFAST
ONE MORNING EARLY LYING IN MY BED AND FILLED WITH THOUGHTS ABOUT MY DANGER FROM THE APPEARANCES OF SAVAGES I FOUND IT DISCOMPOSED ME VERY MUCH
IN THE MEANTIME OUR COMRADE WHO BROUGHT US THE GOOD NEWS AND I WILL GO AND FIND OUT THE HOUSE THAT WE MAY CONSULT WHAT HAD BEST BE DONE THIS SPEECH AND PLAN WERE APPROVED OF BY ALL AND THEY WERE SOON READY
NO NONE AT ALL
BUT AS THOU SAWEST THAT HE HAD QUICKLY LAVISHED ALL AWAY AND HAD PRESENTLY LEFT HIM NOTHING BUT RAGS
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT INFINITE LABOR THAT I FELLED THIS TREE
AS HE LOOKED AT HER HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HIMSELF
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE FIRST GUN THAT HAD BEEN FIRED THERE SINCE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD
ALADDIN MET HIM AT THE GATE AND WITHOUT GIVING ANY REPLY TO HIS INQUIRIES CONDUCTED HIM TO THE GRAND SALOON WHERE THE SULTAN TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE FOUND THE WINDOW WHICH WAS LEFT IMPERFECT TO CORRESPOND EXACTLY WITH THE OTHERS
THEN PROSPERO AFTER MANY YEARS OF ABSENCE WENT BACK TO HIS OWN DUKEDOM WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED WITH GREAT JOY BY HIS FAITHFUL SUBJECTS
FETCH IT AND LET US SEE HOW THEY WILL LOOK WHEN WE HAVE ARRANGED THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT COLORS ALADDIN'S MOTHER BROUGHT THE CHINA DISH WHEN HE TOOK THE JEWELS OUT OF THE TWO PURSES IN WHICH HE HAD KEPT THEM AND PLACED THEM IN ORDER ACCORDING TO HIS FANCY
I THEN REFLECTED THAT AS GOD WHO WAS NOT ONLY RIGHTEOUS BUT OMNIPOTENT HAD THOUGHT FIT THUS TO PUNISH AND AFFLICT ME SO HE WAS ABLE TO DELIVER ME
BUT I BEHELD BUT A WHILE AND HE HAD LAVISHED ALL AWAY AND HAD NOTHING LEFT BUT RAGS
FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT CHRISTIAN BY REASON OF HIS WOUNDS MUST NEEDS GROW WEAKER AND WEAKER
I IMMEDIATELY LET FLY WITHOUT WAITING TILL HE WAS WITHIN REACH
I WALKED AS FAR AS I COULD UPON THE SHORE TO HAVE GOT TO HER
BUT ONE DAY I TOOK A THICK CUDGEL AND THREW IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH SO LUCKILY AT A LINNET THAT I KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND SEIZING HIM BY THE NECK WITH BOTH MY HANDS RAN WITH HIM IN TRIUMPH TO MY NURSE
BECAUSE THEY WOULD ROW AWAY TO THE SHIP AND THEN THE REST OF THEM WOULD BE SURE TO WEIGH AND SET SAIL AND SO OUR RECOVERING THE SHIP WOULD BE LOST
FOR FRIDAY GAVE THEM CANDLES SUCH AS WE MADE OURSELVES FOR THEIR COMFORT
AS THE PALMER WAS BEING GUIDED TO HIS CHAMBER HE WAS MET BY THE WAITING-MAID OF ROWENA WHO INFORMED HIM THAT HER MISTRESS DESIRED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
I ATE OF THE FRUITS WHICH I FOUND EXCELLENT
HE THEN SENT HIS SERVANTS TO THEIR WORK AND TAKING HIS HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF HIS POCKET HE DOUBLED AND SPREAD IT ON HIS LEFT HAND WHICH HE PLACED FLAT ON THE GROUND WITH THE PALM UPWARD MAKING ME A SIGN TO STEP INTO IT AS I COULD EASILY DO FOR IT WAS NOT ABOVE A FOOT IN THICKNESS
SHAKESPEARE POSSESSED A VERY UNUSUAL COMBINATION OF TWO RARE GIFTS
BUT HAD NO SOONER BEGUN TO RUB IT THAN IN AN INSTANT A HIDEOUS GENIE OF GIGANTIC SIZE APPEARED BEFORE HER AND SAID TO HER IN A VOICE OF THUNDER WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE
NOW THOUGH WE THOUGHT THE WIND DID A LITTLE ABATE YET THE SHIP HAVING THUS STRUCK UPON THE SAND AND STICKING TOO FAST FOR US TO EXPECT HER GETTING OFF WE WERE IN A DREADFUL CONDITION INDEED AND HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO THINK OF SAVING OUR LIVES AS WELL AS WE COULD
HOWEVER THEY HAD NO WAY LEFT THEM BUT ACCEPT IT AND IT WAS NOW THE BUSINESS OF THE PRISONERS AS MUCH AS OF THE CAPTAIN TO PERSUADE THE OTHER FIVE TO DO THEIR DUTY
EVEN IN DEATH SHALT THOU THINK ON THE GROANS WHICH THIS CASTLE HAS ECHOED ON THE BLOOD THAT IS ENGRAINED IN ITS FLOORS GO LEAVE ME FIEND REPLIED THE WOUNDED NORMAN
IN A HOLLOW A LITTLE BELOW HIM WAS HIS LATE COMPANION DANDIE DINMONT ENGAGED WITH TWO OTHER MEN IN A DESPERATE STRUGGLE
BERTRAM WAS BEFORE LONG RESTORED TO THE POSSESSION OF HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND PROPERTY AND JULIA MANNERING BECAME HIS WIFE
ARIEL WHO LONGED FOR HIS COMPLETE FREEDOM GRUMBLED TO BE KEPT IN DRUDGERY BUT ON BEING THREATENINGLY REMINDED OF ALL THE SUFFERINGS HE HAD UNDERGONE WHEN SYCORAX RULED IN THE LAND AND OF THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE HE OWED TO THE MASTER WHO HAD MADE THOSE SUFFERINGS TO END HE CEASED TO COMPLAIN AND PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO DO WHATEVER PROSPERO MIGHT COMMAND
HAVING FILLED THE TWO NEW PURSES HIS UNCLE HAD BOUGHT FOR HIM WITH HIS CLOTHES HE WRAPPED SOME UP IN THE SKIRTS OF HIS VEST AND CRAMMED HIS BOSOM AS FULL AS IT COULD HOLD
THOUGH AN IGNORANT MAN HE BECAME DEEPLY RELIGIOUS
UPON THIS THE HURGO AND HIS TRAIN WITHDREW WITH MUCH CIVILITY AND CHEERFUL COUNTENANCES
I DETERMINED TO VISIT THIS WONDERFUL PLACE AND IN MY WAY THITHER SAW FISHES OF 100 AND 200 CUBITS LONG THAT OCCASION MORE FEAR THAN HURT
CHARLES HAZLEWOOD HIMSELF HOWEVER CONTINUED TO PROTEST THAT THE WOUNDING WAS ACCIDENTAL
I WILL RETURN IMMEDIATELY ALI BABA WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND ORDERED MORGIANA TO PUT NO SALT IN THE MEAT THAT WAS TO BE DRESSED THAT NIGHT
ARE YOU HERE IN GOD'S NAME SAID THE GUIDE TO THE DRIVER
WHEN THE CAPTAIN AND THE MATE ENTERING FIRST WITH THEIR ARMS IMMEDIATELY KNOCKED DOWN THE SECOND MATE AND CARPENTER WITH THE BUTT-END OF THEIR MUSKETS BEING VERY FAITHFULLY SECONDED BY THEIR MEN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WERE SPENT SALMON SPEARING AND HUNTING OTTERS ON THE HILLS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
SO WHEN HE WAS GONE TO BED HE TOLD HIS WIFE WHAT HE HAD DONE TO WIT THAT HE HAD TAKEN A COUPLE OF PRISONERS AND CAST THEM INTO HIS DUNGEON FOR TRESPASSING ON HIS GROUNDS
ALSO THEY HAD LEFT THEIR MORTAL GARMENTS BEHIND THEM IN THE RIVER
THE SEAMEN THREW ME THE END OF THE CORD WHICH I FASTENED TO A HOLE IN THE FORE PART OF THE BOAT AND THE OTHER END TO A MAN-OF-WAR
AND WHEN THEY WERE IN A BLAZE THREW IN SOME INCENSE PRONOUNCING SEVERAL MAGICAL WORDS WHICH ALADDIN DID NOT UNDERSTAND
THE SPLENDID ARMOUR OF THE KNIGHTS WAS NOW DEFACED WITH DUST AND BLOOD AND GAVE WAY AT EVERY STROKE OF THE SWORD AND BATTLE-AXE
SHE TURNED TO HER FATHER--"I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU FOR I AM YOURS IF THERE BE TRUTH IN SIGHT HE SAID YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER THEN SHE SAID TO ORLANDO I GIVE MYSELF TO YOU FOR I AM YOURS IF THERE BE TRUTH IN SIGHT HE SAID YOU ARE MY ROSALIND I WILL HAVE NO FATHER IF YOU BE NOT HE SHE SAID TO THE DUKE AND TO ORLANDO I WILL HAVE NO HUSBAND IF YOU BE NOT HE SO ORLANDO AND ROSALIND WERE MARRIED AND OLIVER AND CELIA AND THEY LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER RETURNING WITH THE DUKE TO THE KINGDOM
THIS WAS SURPRISING TO ME BECAUSE I HAD GIVEN OVER EXPECTING ANY MORE PROVISIONS EXCEPT WHAT WAS SPOILED BY THE WATER
I PRETENDED TO BE WORSE THAN I REALLY WAS AND DESIRED LEAVE TO TAKE THE FRESH AIR OF THE SEA WITH A PAGE WHOM I WAS VERY FOND OF AND WHO HAD SOMETIMES BEEN TRUSTED WITH ME
HE BECAME A SOLDIER
AND ON LEARNING THE TIME AT WHICH YOUNG BERTRAM WAS BORN HE WENT OUTSIDE TO STUDY THE HEAVENS WITH A VIEW TO FORETELLING WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE CHILD WOULD BE
WHEN I CALLED AT A GOOD DISTANCE ONE OF THE MEN WAS ORDERED TO SPEAK AGAIN AND SAY TO THE CAPTAIN CAPTAIN THE COMMANDER CALLS FOR YOU AND PRESENTLY THE CAPTAIN REPLIED TELL HIS EXCELLENCY I AM JUST COMING THIS MORE PERFECTLY AMAZED THEM AND THEY ALL BELIEVED THAT THE COMMANDER WAS JUST BY WITH HIS FIFTY MEN
SLAY HIM NOT SIR KNIGHT CRIED THE GRAND MASTER
COME IN MORGIANA SAID ALI BABA AND LET COGIA HOUSSAIN SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO THAT HE MAY TELL US WHAT HE THINKS OF YOUR PERFORMANCE COGIA HOUSSAIN WHO DID NOT EXPECT THIS DIVERSION AFTER SUPPER BEGAN TO FEAR HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE THOUGHT HE HAD FOUND
AS TO THE FIVE IN THE CAVE I RESOLVED TO KEEP THEM FAST BUT FRIDAY WENT IN TWICE A DAY TO THEM TO SUPPLY THEM WITH NECESSARIES
STRONG HOWEVER AS THE RUFFIAN WAS HE WAS NOT EQUAL TO THE JOINT EFFORTS OF THE THREE MEN AND AT LENGTH HE WAS FAIRLY MASTERED DISARMED AND TIGHTLY BOUND
BUT BY GOOD LUCK I HAD ON ME A BUFF JERKIN WHICH THEY COULD NOT PIERCE
HE PUT OUT AGAIN TO SEA AND AFTER SOME DAYS SAIL WE ARRIVED AT THE HARBOR OF A GREAT CITY THE HOUSES OF WHICH OVERHUNG THE SEA
AND COLONEL MANNERING HAVING DONE WHAT HE COULD FOR MISS BERTRAM IN HER UNHAPPY CONDITION LEFT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THE INTENTION OF RETURNING IN TIME FOR THE ADJOURNED SALE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUYING THE ESTATE
WHEN DAY APPEARED THE GIANT AWOKE GOT UP WENT OUT AND LEFT US IN THE PALACE
GO NOW AND TELL YOUR MISTRESS
HE TOOK ME UP IN HIS RIGHT FOREFOOT AND HELD ME AS A NURSE DOES A CHILD
NEAR THIS DWELLING OF MINE BUT A LITTLE FARTHER WITHIN THE LAND AND UPON LOWER GROUND LAY MY TWO PIECES OF CORN LAND WHICH I KEPT DULY CULTIVATED AND SOWED AND WHICH DULY YIELDED ME THEIR HARVEST IN ITS SEASON
I HAVE DIAMONDS ENOUGH FOR YOU AND MYSELF MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER MERCHANTS TOGETHER
THE RHINOCEROS FIGHTS WITH THE ELEPHANT RUNS HIS HORN INTO HIS BELLY AND CARRIES HIM OFF UPON HIS HEAD
THERE WAS THE COMB I HAD CONTRIVED OUT OF THE STUMPS OF THE KING'S BEARD AND ANOTHER OF THE SAME MATERIALS BUT FIXED INTO A PARING OF HER MAJESTY'S THUMB-NAIL WHICH SERVED FOR THE BACK
THEN HOPEFUL GROANED IN HIMSELF SAYING OH THAT I HAD KEPT ON MY WAY CHR
AND WHENEVER I HAD OCCASION FOR MORE CORN I HAD MORE LAND ADJOINING AS FIT AS THAT
THE BLUE TURQUOISES
I LOOKED AND SAW HIM OPEN THE BOOK AND READ THEREIN
THIS GAVE ME NOT ONLY EGRESS AND REGRESS AS IT WAS A BACK WAY TO MY TENT AND TO MY STOREHOUSE BUT GAVE ME ROOM TO STORE MY GOODS
THE FIVE CHALLENGERS WERE TO UNDERTAKE ALL COMERS
I WAS OVERJOYED TO HEAR THEM SPEAK IN MY OWN LANGUAGE AND SATISFIED THEIR CURIOSITY BY GIVING THEM AN ACCOUNT OF MY SHIPWRECK AND HOW I FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE NEGROES
ALADDIN THANKED HIM FOR HIS FAIR DEALING AND NEVER AFTER WENT TO ANY OTHER PERSON
ABOUT THREE WEEKS AFTER THIS EXPLOIT THERE ARRIVED A SOLEMN EMBASSY FROM BLEFUSCU WITH HUMBLE OFFERS OF A PEACE
FOR NOW WHAT FOR WANT OF BREAD AND WATER AND BY REASON OF THE WOUNDS THEY RECEIVED WHEN HE BEAT THEM THEY COULD DO LITTLE BUT BREATHE
THIS LINNET AS NEAR AS I CAN REMEMBER SEEMED TO BE SOMEWHAT LARGER THAN AN ENGLISH SWAN
YET DID THE FIRE BURN HIGHER AND HOTTER
HE DOES NOT COUNT HIS MONEY BUT MEASURES IT CASSIM DESIRED HER TO EXPLAIN THE RIDDLE WHICH SHE DID BY TELLING HIM THE STRATAGEM SHE HAD USED TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY AND SHOWED HIM THE PIECE OF MONEY WHICH WAS SO OLD THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL IN WHAT PRINCE'S REIGN IT WAS COINED
THESE DIVERSIONS ARE OFTEN ATTENDED WITH FATAL ACCIDENTS WHEREOF GREAT NUMBERS ARE ON RECORD
THE MATE CALLING FOR HELP RUSHED HOWEVER INTO THE ROUND-HOUSE WOUNDED AS HE WAS AND WITH HIS PISTOL SHOT THE NEW CAPTAIN THROUGH THE HEAD THE BULLET ENTERING AT HIS MOUTH AND CAME OUT AGAIN BEHIND ONE OF HIS EARS SO THAT HE NEVER SPOKE A WORD MORE
HE OBSERVED IT WITH ATTENTION AND DISTINGUISHED SOON AFTER A BODY OF HORSEMEN WHOM HE SUSPECTED MIGHT BE ROBBERS
THE COLONEL SAW BEFORE HIM THE MAN WHOM HE SUPPOSED HE HAD KILLED IN INDIA
MY BROTHER SAID HE REMEMBEREST THOU NOT HOW VALIANT THOU HAST BEEN HERETOFORE
AS TO MAKING SAIL WE HAD NONE NOR IF WE HAD COULD WE HAVE DONE ANYTHING WITH IT
THE TWO ROCS APPROACHED WITH A FRIGHTFUL NOISE WHICH THEY REDOUBLED WHEN THEY SAW THE EGG BROKEN AND THEIR YOUNG ONE GONE
AND YET NOT AN UGLY YELLOW NAUSEOUS TAWNY AS THE BRAZILIANS AND VIRGINIANS AND OTHER NATIVES OF AMERICA ARE BUT OF A BRIGHT KIND OF A DUN OLIVE-COLOR THAT HAD IN IT SOMETHING VERY AGREEABLE THOUGH NOT VERY EASY TO DESCRIBE
I WILL SHOW YOU HERE SOME EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHICH WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN YOU WILL THANK ME FOR
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SUGGESTION OF THE VIZIER THE SULTAN REPLIED TO THE MOTHER OF ALADDIN
HE WAS NOW TO TREMBLE FOR HER LIFE
THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE MIND OF THE SULTAN GAVE RISE TO VARIOUS SPECULATIONS AND REPORTS
THE ENVOY FURTHER ADDED THAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE AND AMITY BETWEEN BOTH EMPIRES HIS MASTER EXPECTED THAT HIS BROTHER OF BLEFUSCU WOULD GIVE ORDERS TO HAVE ME SENT BACK TO LILLIPUT BOUND HAND AND FOOT TO BE PUNISHED AS A TRAITOR
THE CELL WAS SO DARK THAT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD DETECT THE FORM OF THE SMUGGLER WHO WAS LYING ON A PALLET-BED BESIDE THE BAR
THE SULTAN'S FINE PROMISE WILL COME TO NAUGHT
WHERE I COULD NOT MANAGE MY TWO SCULLS OR LITTLE OARS FOR WANT OF ROOM
ETERNAL GLORY THOU SHALT WIN
HOWEVER I SPARED HER A BIT I SAY AND SHE WENT TO IT SMELLED AT IT AND ATE IT AND LOOKED AS IF PLEASED FOR MORE
HE IS NOW IN YOUR PALACE DISGUISED IN THE HABIT OF THE HOLY WOMAN FATIMA WHOM HE HAS MURDERED
SINDBAD HERE ORDERED ONE HUNDRED SEQUINS TO BE GIVEN TO HINDBAD AND REQUESTED HIM AND THE OTHER GUESTS TO DINE WITH HIM THE NEXT DAY TO HEAR THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SIXTH VOYAGE
AS SOON AS THE SHIP WAS THUS SECURED THE CAPTAIN ORDERED GUNS TO BE FIRED WHICH WAS THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON WITH ME TO GIVE ME NOTICE OF HIS SUCCESS WHICH YOU MAY BE SURE I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR HAVING SAT WATCHING UPON THE SHORE FOR IT TILL NEAR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
BROWN WHEN HE SAW WHAT HAD OCCURRED BECAME FRIGHTENED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE DANGERS OF HIS POSITION
THE DEEP RED RUBIES
BOTH THE SAXON CHIEFS WERE MADE PRISONERS AT THE SAME MOMENT WHILE THE ATTENDANTS EMBARRASSED WITH BAGGAGE SURPRISED AND TERRIFIED AT THE FATE OF THEIR MASTERS FELL AN EASY PREY TO THE ASSAILANTS
WHEN ALADDIN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD SOLD HIM TWELVE SUCH FOR A PIECE OF GOLD EACH
WHEN ABDALLA CAME FOR THE DESSERT OR FRUIT AND HAD PUT IT WITH THE WINE AND GLASSES BEFORE ALI BABA MORGIANA RETIRED DRESSED HERSELF NEATLY WITH A SUITABLE HEAD-DRESS LIKE A DANCER GIRDED HER WAIST WITH A SILVER-GILT GIRDLE TO WHICH THERE HUNG A PONIARD WITH A HILT AND GUARD OF THE SAME METAL AND PUT A HANDSOME MASK ON HER FACE
BY HEAVENS
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS
I AM READY TO OBEY THEE AS THY SLAVE AND THE SLAVE OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THAT LAMP IN THEIR HANDS
BUT THE CAPTAIN OBSERVED THAT THE NEXT DOOR WAS CHALKED IN THE SAME MANNER AND IN THE SAME PLACE
HE WAS NO LONGER INCLINED TO SLEEP SO HE CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME TO GAZE OUT ON THE TROUBLED SEA AS IT ROLLED UNDER THE INDISTINCT LIGHT OF A HAZY AND OFTEN OVERCLOUDED MOON
AS SOON AS HE RECOVERED HE RELATED TO HIS MOTHER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THEY WERE BOTH VERY VEHEMENT IN THEIR COMPLAINTS OF THE CRUEL MAGICIAN
THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH OFFICERS IN HABITS OF CEREMONY MOUNTED ON HORSES RICHLY CAPARISONED EACH ATTENDED BY A GREAT MANY FOOTMEN
I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE OLD LAMP FOR A NEW ONE AND THE NEXT MORNING I FOUND MYSELF IN THIS UNKNOWN COUNTRY WHICH I AM TOLD IS AFRICA PRINCESS SAID ALADDIN INTERRUPTING HER YOU HAVE EXPLAINED ALL BY TELLING ME WE ARE IN AFRICA
ALL AROUND THE CASTLE WAS A SCENE OF BUSY COMMOTION THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE BEING GATHERED FROM FAR AND NEAR TO PARTAKE OF THE FUNERAL BANQUET
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ONE OF YOUR AGE CAN SEE SO WELL
WHEN WE ENTERED THE FOREST WE SAW A GREAT NUMBER OF APES OF SEVERAL SIZES WHO FLED AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED US AND CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF THE TREES WITH AMAZING SWIFTNESS
THE CREW PERCEIVED ME AND THE CAPTAIN SENT HIS BOAT FOR ME
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THEIR CONFUSION WHEN THEY FOUND THE BOAT FAST AGROUND IN THE CREEK THE TIDE EBBED OUT AND THEIR TWO MEN GONE
THEN SAID THEY HAVE YOU NONE
BUT LET US KNOW AS NIGH AS POSSIBLE HOW MUCH WE HAVE
THEY HAVE BROKEN IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE LOOKING FROM THE PRISON WINDOW THEY COULD SEE THE GANG OF SMUGGLERS HURRYING HERE AND THERE SOME WITH LIGHTED TORCHES OTHERS CARRYING BARRELS TOWARDS THE SHORE
BUT THEIR HEADLONG RUSH THROUGH THE BROKEN BARRIERS WAS MET BY FRONT-DE BOEUF HIMSELF AND A NUMBER OF THE DEFENDERS
MY SON SAID HE WHAT A MAN YOU ARE TO DO SUCH SURPRISING THINGS ALWAYS IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
AND BESIDES O THOU DESTROYING APOLLYON TO SPEAK TRUTH I LIKE HIS SERVICE HIS WAGES HIS SERVANTS HIS GOVERNMENT HIS COMPANY AND COUNTRY BETTER THAN THINE
THUS UNNOTICED AND SAFE MYSELF I LIFTED MY HEAD SLYLY UP AND WITH HORROR I BEHELD THAT THE WOLF HAD ATE HIS WAY INTO THE HORSE'S BODY
BUT THE MAN ANSWERED NEVER A WORD
THEY SURROUNDED THE TREE IN WHICH I WAS CONCEALED WITH THEIR TRUNKS UPLIFTED AND ALL FIXED THEIR EYES UPON ME
THE MORNING AFTER HIS ARRIVAL THE DOMINIE WHO EVEN AFTER SO MANY YEARS CONTINUED TO BLAME HIMSELF FOR THE LOSS OF LITTLE HARRY MADE HIS WAY IN A SPIRIT OF CURIOSITY TO WARROCH POINT A PLACE HE HAD NEVER APPROACHED SINCE THE CHILD HAD DISAPPEARED
BUT THIS WAS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN OR ELSE VERY PROBABLY MY BRAINS HAD BEEN DASHED OUT
BUT WHEN HE CAME THERE HE FOUND THEM ALIVE AND TRULY ALIVE WAS ALL
LOOK SHE SAID HOW THE SETTING SUN BREAKS THROUGH THE CLOUD THAT'S BEEN DARKENING THE SKY ALL DAY
EVAN
EVAN
EVAN
EVAN
EVAN
EVAN
BUT IN THE STRUGGLE WHICH ENSUED BETWEEN THEM IT WAS DISCHARGED BY ACCIDENT AND YOUNG HAZLEWOOD FELL TO THE GROUND WOUNDED IN THE SHOULDER
HE THEN TOLD HIS MOTHER ALL HIS ADVENTURE AND CONCLUDED BY DECLARING I LOVE THE PRINCESS MORE THAN I CAN EXPRESS AND AM RESOLVED THAT I WILL ASK HER IN MARRIAGE OF THE SULTAN ALADDIN'S MOTHER LISTENED WITH SURPRISE TO WHAT HER SON TOLD HER
WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN A MOST ASTONISHING OBJECT WORTHY TO HAVE THE DESCRIPTION OF IT TRANSMITTED TO FUTURE AGES
VIZ BREAD RICE THREE DUTCH CHEESES FIVE PIECES OF DRIED GOAT'S FLESH WHICH WE LIVED MUCH UPON AND A LITTLE REMAINDER OF EUROPEAN CORN WHICH HAD BEEN LAID BY FOR SOME FOWLS WHICH WE BROUGHT TO SEA WITH US BUT THE FOWLS WERE KILLED
IT IS ROBINSON CRUSOE THERE IS NO MORE USEFUL TALENT THAN THE ABILITY TO THINK AND SPEAK OR WRITE CLEARLY AND SIMPLY NO MATTER WHAT OUR VOCATION IN LIFE
HOWEVER IT SEEMS AS I LEARNED AFTERWARDS THEY MAKE THEIR WOODEN SWORDS SO SHARP SO HEAVY AND THE WOOD IS SO HARD THAT THEY WILL EVEN CUT OFF HEADS WITH THEM AY AND ARMS AND THAT AT ONE BLOW TOO
HE WAS PLEASED AT MY GOOD LUCK ACCEPTED MY PRESENT AND IN RETURN GAVE ME ONE MUCH MORE CONSIDERABLE
IF I HAD HAD HANDS TO HAVE REFITTED HER AND TO HAVE LAUNCHED HER INTO THE WATER THE BOAT WOULD HAVE DONE WELL ENOUGH AND I MIGHT HAVE GONE BACK INTO THE BRAZILS WITH HER EASILY ENOUGH
BUT I WITHSTOOD THIS DICTATE OF DESPAIR AND SUBMITTED MYSELF TO THE WILL OF GOD WHO DISPOSES OF OUR LIVES AT HIS PLEASURE
WHEN A GREAT OFFICE IS VACANT EITHER BY DEATH OR DISGRACE WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS FIVE OR SIX OF THOSE CANDIDATES PETITION THE EMPEROR TO ENTERTAIN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COURT WITH A DANCE ON THE ROPE AND WHOEVER JUMPS THE HIGHEST WITHOUT FALLING SUCCEEDS IN THE OFFICE
IN THESE SHALT THOU WEIGH ME OUT A THOUSAND SILVER POUNDS HOLY ABRAHAM RETURNED THE JEW HEARD MAN EVER SUCH A DEMAND
AND THERE IS ROWENA FOR WHOM THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT SHALL FIGHT AGAINST ALL COMERS
WHAT THE SHORE WAS WHETHER ROCK OR SAND WHETHER STEEP OR SHOAL WE KNEW NOT
WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AT NIGHT I KNEW NOT NOR INDEED WHERE TO REST FOR I WAS AFRAID TO LIE DOWN ON THE GROUND NOT KNOWING BUT SOME WILD BEAST MIGHT DEVOUR ME THOUGH AS I AFTERWARDS FOUND THERE WAS REALLY NO NEED FOR THOSE FEARS
AND BROWN NOTICED THAT WHENEVER HE APPROACHED HIM HE ENDEAVOURED TO HIDE HIS FACE
UPON THIS HE MADE SIGNS TO ME THAT HE SHOULD BURY THEM WITH SAND THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SEEN BY THE REST IF THEY FOLLOWED
IT SHALL FOR A LONG TIME BE HIS ENTIRE LIBRARY
IN THIS VESSEL AFTER A LONG VOYAGE I ARRIVED IN ENGLAND THE 11TH OF JUNE IN THE YEAR 1687 HAVING BEEN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ABSENT
THE FIRST OF THESE I FILLED WITH PROVISIONS
AND A CROWD OF PEOPLE WITH A CLERGYMAN AND A SURGEON HAD FLOCKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE DYING GIPSY LAY
BUT ALL IN VAIN FOR WE WERE WHOLLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO EACH OTHER
NOUGHT SHALL GO ILL MEANWHILE OBERON FOUND TITANIA ASLEEP ON A BANK WHERE GREW WILD THYME OXLIPS AND VIOLETS AND WOODBINE MUSK-ROSES AND EGLANTINE
HOWEVER THE CAPTAIN TOLD HIM HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS ARMS AT DISCRETION AND TRUST TO THE GOVERNOR'S MERCY
FOR LIFTING UP THE LAPPET OF HIS COAT HE PUT ME GENTLY INTO IT AND IMMEDIATELY RAN ALONG WITH ME TO HIS MASTER WHO WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FARMER AND THE SAME PERSON I HAD FIRST SEEN IN THE FIELD
AND I MADE THE MAN THEY HAD LEFT IN THE BOAT WHO WAS NOW ONE OF US TO CALL THEM BY NAME TO TRY IF I COULD BRING THEM TO A PARLEY AND SO PERHAPS MIGHT REDUCE THEM TO TERMS
HER DRESS WAS EVEN STRANGER THAN USUAL AND HER BLACK HAIR HUNG LOOSE ABOUT HER WHILE HER DARK EYES FLASHED ANGRILY
THIS GRIEVED ME HEARTILY
I AM FRIENDLESS DEFENCELESS AND THE PRISONER OF MY ACCUSER THERE
THE CAPTAIN AND HIS TWO MEN AND THE THREE PRISONERS OF WAR WHOM WE HAD TRUSTED WITH ARMS
THESE I STOWED BY THEMSELVES THERE BEING NO NEED TO PUT THEM INTO THE CHEST NOR ANY ROOM FOR THEM
BY THIS MEANS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN DREW ALADDIN INSENSIBLY BEYOND THE GARDENS AND CROSSED THE COUNTRY TILL THEY NEARLY REACHED THE MOUNTAINS
ON THE BAT'S BACK I DO FLY AFTER SUMMER MERRILY
IN THE MEANTIME CASSIM'S WIFE WAS VERY UNEASY WHEN NIGHT CAME AND HER HUSBAND WAS NOT RETURNED
SO WHEN THE TWO LADDERS WERE TAKEN DOWN NO MAN LIVING COULD COME DOWN TO ME WITHOUT DOING HIMSELF MISCHIEF
ONE EVENING IN THE AUTUMN OF THE YEAR CEDRIC WAS ABOUT TO SIT DOWN TO SUPPER IN THE OLD HALL AT ROTHERWOOD WHEN THE BLAST OF A HORN WAS HEARD AT HIS GATE
YES THERE'S THIRTY YONDER FROM THE OLD WIFE OF AN HUNDRED TO THE BABE THAT WAS BORN LAST WEEK THAT YE HAVE TURNED OUT O THEIR HOUSES TO SLEEP WITH THE BLACK-COCK IN THE MOORS
I BEG YOU TO GIVE ME FORTY DAYS AND IF IN THAT TIME I CANNOT RESTORE IT I WILL OFFER MY HEAD TO BE DISPOSED OF AT YOUR PLEASURE I GIVE YOU THE TIME YOU ASK BUT AT THE END OF THE FORTY DAYS FORGET NOT TO PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE ME ALADDIN WENT OUT OF THE SULTAN'S PALACE IN A CONDITION OF EXCEEDING HUMILIATION
I ALSO HAVE HAD MY HOURS OF VENGEANCE
MORGIANA ON HER RETURN WARMED SOME WATER TO WASH THE BODY AND AT THE SAME TIME ALI BABA PERFUMED IT WITH INCENSE AND WRAPPED IT IN THE BURYING CLOTHES WITH THE ACCUSTOMED CEREMONIES
NOTHING CAN DESCRIBE THE CONFUSION OF THOUGHT WHICH I FELT WHEN I SANK INTO THE WATER
BUT HE HAD BLED INWARDLY FOR HE WAS QUITE DEAD
AND BESIDES THE EXCESSIVE SMART GAVE ME MUCH DISTURBANCE IN MY WORK
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARD ALI BABA CELEBRATED THE NUPTIALS OF HIS SON AND MORGIANA WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY A SUMPTUOUS FEAST AND THE USUAL DANCING AND SPECTACLES
LOOKING STEADFASTLY UPON HIM I KNEW HIM TO BE THE PERSON WHO IN MY SECOND VOYAGE HAD LEFT ME IN THE ISLAND WHERE I FELL ASLEEP AND SAILED WITHOUT ME OR SENDING TO SEEK FOR ME
BUT FORTUNE DISPOSED OTHERWISE OF ME
SOME TIME AFTER ASKING A FRIEND AT COURT HOW THEY CAME TO FIX ON THAT DETERMINATE NUMBER
I MUST GO TO THE BARBER'S FOR METHINKS I AM MARVELOUS HAIRY ABOUT THE FACE WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING TO EAT SAID THE FAIRY QUEEN
IT BLEW IN SUCH A TERRIBLE MANNER THAT FOR TWELVE DAYS TOGETHER WE COULD DO NOTHING BUT DRIVE
WHY SHE ASKED
FAREWELL THE CALIPH'S PRESENT WAS A COMPLETE SUIT OF CLOTH OF GOLD VALUED AT ONE THOUSAND SEQUINS
AND SOME OF THEM AS I WAS AFTERWARDS TOLD WERE HURT WITH THE FALLS THEY GOT BY LEAPING FROM MY SIDES UPON THE GROUND
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK I FOUND NO SIGN OF ANY VISITOR
HE DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS WAY TO ENGLAND AND TO WAIT THERE UNTIL HE RECEIVED LETTERS FROM FRIENDS IN HIS REGIMENT ESTABLISHING HIS IDENTITY IN POSSESSION OF WHICH HE COULD AGAIN SHOW HIMSELF AT KIPPLETRINGAN AND OFFER TO YOUNG HAZLEWOOD ANY EXPLANATION OR SATISFACTION HE MIGHT REQUIRE

THE MORE I KNOW THE MORE I ADMIRE YOU THE SULTAN RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND AFTER THIS WENT FREQUENTLY TO THE WINDOW TO CONTEMPLATE AND ADMIRE THE WONDERFUL PALACE OF HIS SON-IN-LAW
I TOLD HIM I LOOKED UPON HIM AS A MAN SENT FROM HEAVEN TO DELIVER ME AND THAT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION SEEMED TO BE A CHAIN OF WONDERS
WE ARE CERTAINLY DISCOVERED SAID THE CAPTAIN

AND AS FOR MYSELF ALTHOUGH I ABHORRED SUCH KIND OF SPECTACLES YET MY CURIOSITY TEMPTED ME TO SEE SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT MUST BE EXTRAORDINARY
THIS GENTLEMAN TREATED ME WITH KINDNESS AND DESIRED I WOULD LET HIM KNOW WHAT PLACE I CAME FROM LAST AND WHITHER I WAS BOUND
THE CAPTAIN HEARING ME UTTER THESE ABSURDITIES CONCLUDED I WAS RAVING
BUT BESIDES THESE AND WHAT WAS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE USEFUL TO ME HE BROUGHT ME SIX NEW CLEAN SHIRTS SIX VERY GOOD NECKCLOTHS TWO PAIR OF GLOVES ONE PAIR OF SHOES A HAT AND ONE PAIR OF STOCKINGS WITH A VERY GOOD SUIT OF CLOTHES OF HIS OWN WHICH HAD BEEN WORN BUT VERY LITTLE
AND IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED YOU ALSO TO HIS REVENGE
THE CAPTAIN MR JOHN BIDDEL OF DEPTFORD A VERY CIVIL MAN AND AN EXCELLENT SAILOR
IF YOU HAVE NO MIND TO LEARN ANY HANDICRAFT I WILL TAKE A SHOP FOR YOU FURNISH IT WITH ALL SORTS OF FINE STUFFS AND LINENS AND THEN WITH THE MONEY YOU MAKE OF THEM YOU CAN LAY IN FRESH GOODS AND LIVE IN AN HONORABLE WAY
I HAD RATHER YOU WOULD SELL IT THAN RUN THE HAZARD OF BEING FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AGAIN BY TOUCHING IT
AND WE WERE EVEN DRIVEN INTO OUR CLOSE QUARTERS TO SHELTER US FROM THE VERY FOAM AND SPRAY OF THE SEA
WHEN THE TWO CHAMPIONS STOOD OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE LISTS THE PUBLIC EXPECTATION WAS STRAINED TO HIGHEST PITCH
AND THUS IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF HIS OWN REAL IDENTITY SURROUNDED BY DANGERS AND WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A FRIEND WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES ACCUSED OF A HEAVY CRIME AND ALMOST PENNILESS DID THE WEARY WANDERER FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER AN INTERVAL OF MANY EVENTFUL YEARS APPROACH THE REMAINS OF THE CASTLE WHERE HIS ANCESTORS HAD ONCE DWELT IN LORDLY SPLENDOUR
THE ENEMY WAS SO FRIGHTED WHEN THEY SAW ME THAT THEY LEAPED OUT OF THEIR SHIPS AND SWAM TO SHORE WHERE THERE COULD NOT BE FEWER THAN THIRTY THOUSAND SOULS
THE YOUNGER BROTHER NOT HAVING RECEIVED AS USUAL HIS ANNUAL COMMUNICATION PREPARED TO TAKE A HOROSCOPE AND ASCERTAIN HIS BROTHER'S PROCEEDINGS
AND THOUGH IT BROUGHT ME TO MYSELF YET IT WAS A GOOD WHILE BEFORE I COULD SPEAK A WORD TO HIM
I HAD ALWAYS REGARDED AS FABULOUS WHAT I HAD HEARD SAILORS AND OTHERS RELATE OF THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS AND OF THE STRATAGEMS EMPLOYED BY MERCHANTS TO OBTAIN JEWELS FROM THENCE
AT FIRST FOR SOME TIME I WAS NOT ABLE TO ANSWER HIM ONE WORD
MY WORD IS PASSED TO MY COMRADE IN ARMS
ALSO THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD POISONED HIM WAS OF MEAN BIRTH THOUGH MARRIED TO A PRINCESS A SULTAN'S DAUGHTER
ADMIRE
I WENT ON HORSEBACK AS THE MOST CONVENIENT MANNER OF TRAVELLING
THE OLD WOMAN AT ONCE FOLLOWED THE MACE-BEARER AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE SULTAN BOWED HER HEAD DOWN TO THE CARPET WHICH COVERED THE PLATFORM OF THE THRONE AND REMAINED IN THAT POSTURE TILL HE BADE HER RISE WHICH SHE HAD NO SOONER DONE THAN HE SAID TO HER GOOD WOMAN I HAVE OBSERVED YOU TO STAND MANY DAYS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE RISING OF THE DIVAN
AND WHEN HE HAD LEARNED ALL HE DESIRED TO KNOW WENT UP TO HIM AND TAKING HIM ASIDE FROM HIS COMRADES SAID CHILD WAS NOT YOUR FATHER CALLED MUSTAPHA THE TAILOR YES SIR ANSWERED THE BOY
AND THEN I SAW THIS FROLICSOME ANIMAL FRISKING AND LEAPING UP AND DOWN TILL AT LAST HE CAME TO MY BOX WHICH HE SEEMED TO VIEW WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND CURIOSITY PEEPING IN AT THE DOOR AND EVERY WINDOW
AND WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE ONE SO WRETCHED WHILE THE PORTER WAS THUS INDULGING HIS MELANCHOLY A SERVANT CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TAKING HIM BY THE ARM BADE HIM FOLLOW HIM FOR SINDBAD HIS MASTER WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM
HE PUT AS MUCH GOLD INTO HIS SADDLE-BAG AS HIS HORSE COULD CARRY AND RETURNED TO TOWN
WHILE IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ALIVE THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE OF HIS COMING BACK AND CLAIMING THE ESTATES
AT WHICH TIME THE INHABITANTS SHALL HAVE TWO HOURS WARNING TO KEEP WITHIN THEIR DOORS
A POOR SAXON PEASANT WAS NEXT DRAGGED FORWARD TO THE BAR WHO HAD BEEN CURED OF A PALSY BY THE ACCUSED
AND HE WITH RAGE THAT HELLISH WAS DID FIERCELY ME ENGAGE
BUT ALL THIS WHILE I MADE NO ALLOWANCE FOR THE DANGERS OF SUCH AN UNDERTAKING AND HOW I MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SAVAGES AND PERHAPS SUCH AS I MIGHT HAVE REASON TO THINK FAR WORSE THAN THE LIONS AND TIGERS OF AFRICA
I SHALL NOT TROUBLE THE READER WITH THE DIFFICULTIES I WAS UNDER BY THE HELP OF CERTAIN PADDLES WHICH COST ME TEN DAYS MAKING TO GET MY BOAT TO THE ROYAL PORT OF BLEFUSCU WHERE A MIGHTY CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE APPEARED UPON MY ARRIVAL FULL OF WONDER AT THE SIGHT OF SO PRODIGIOUS A VESSEL
TO-DAY WE SEEK WHAT TO-MORROW WE SHUN
AND WITHAL THEY LOOKING BEFORE THEM ESPIED A MAN WALKING AS THEY DID AND HIS NAME WAS VAIN-CONFIDENCE SO THEY CALLED AFTER HIM AND ASKED HIM WHITHER THAT WAY LED
THIS WAS DONE BEFORE ALADDIN'S MOTHER RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON
WHEN THE PEOPLE OBSERVED I WAS QUIET THEY DISCHARGED NO MORE ARROWS
I EMBARKED IMMEDIATELY TO RETURN TO BAGDAD BUT HAD NOT THE GOOD-FORTUNE TO ARRIVE THERE SO SPEEDILY AS I HAD HOPED
I WILL GO AND ORDER MORGIANA TO PROVIDE A SUPPER THE NEXT DAY ALI BABA'S SON AND COGIA HOUSSAIN MET BY APPOINTMENT TOOK THEIR WALK AND AS THEY RETURNED ALI BABA'S SON LED COGIA HOUSSAIN THROUGH THE STREET WHERE HIS FATHER LIVED AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THE HOUSE STOPPED AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
SO HE HAD HIM ABOUT TO THE BACKSIDE OF THE WALL WHERE HE SAW A MAN WITH A VESSEL OF OIL IN HIS HAND OF THE WHICH HE DID ALSO CONTINUALLY CAST BUT SECRETLY INTO THE FIRE
WHAT TO DO SHE DID NOT KNOW FOR THE BROTH MUST BE MADE
HER SISTER-IN-LAW ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE A GREAT OR A SMALL ONE
HE WAS SHORT IN HEIGHT BUT PRODIGIOUSLY MUSCULAR STRONG AND THICK-SET WITH A SURLY AND SAVAGE SCOWL UPON HIS UNPLEASANT FEATURES
HE EMBRACED HIM WITH ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF JOY AND WHEN HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN AT HIS FEET HELD HIM BY THE HAND AND MADE HIM SIT NEAR HIS THRONE
BUT THESE ARE SUDDENLY GONE THEREFORE PASSION HAD NOT SO MUCH REASON TO LAUGH AT PATIENCE BECAUSE HE HAD HIS GOOD THINGS FIRST AS PATIENCE WILL HAVE TO LAUGH AT PASSION BECAUSE HE HAD HIS BEST THINGS LAST
MANY A READER AT ONCE GOT OUT HIS MAP TO TRY AND LOCATE THE ISLAND OF LILLIPUT AND THE CAPTAIN OF A SHIP TOLD LORD SCARBOROUGH THAT HE KNEW GULLIVER VERY WELL--HAD MET HIM SEVERAL TIMES
OR WHO IS IT THAT RIFLE AND RANSOM AND MAKE PRISONERS IN THESE FORESTS THE YEOMAN THEN LEFT BIDDING GURTH AND WAMBA ON THE PERIL OF THEIR LIVES NOT TO STIR UNTIL HE RETURNED
AMONGST THOSE WHO WERE MOST ACTIVE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO CAPTURE THE MISSING BROWN WAS GLOSSIN THE NEW LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN
IF I KILLED MORE FLESH THAN I COULD EAT THE DOG MUST EAT IT OR VERMIN
THE REST OF MY CATTLE I GOT SAFE ASHORE AND SET THEM A-GRAZING IN A BOWLING GREEN AT GREENWICH WHERE THE FINENESS OF THE GRASS MADE THEM FEED VERY HEARTILY THOUGH I HAD ALWAYS FEARED THE CONTRARY
CEDRIC AND HIS FRIENDS HAVING SEEN THE LAST OF THE TOURNAMENT AND THE FESTIVITIES WHICH FOLLOWED IT NOW SET OUT ON THEIR RETURN TO ROTHERWOOD
FIFTY THOUSAND DRACHMS OF THE BEST WOOD OF ALOES WITH THIRTY GRAINS OF CAMPHIRE AS BIG AS PISTACHIOS
NOBODY BUT ALADDIN KNEW THE SECRET AND HE KEPT IT WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS SILENCE
HE COULD HARDLY BY HIS DAILY LABOR MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF HIS WIFE AND A SON
BUT SHE SCREAMED AND RAN BACK AS WOMEN IN ENGLAND DO AT THE SIGHT OF A TOAD OR A SPIDER
I WILL ORDER YOU A DINNER BUT REMEMBER I EXPECT YOU AS SOON AS YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR REPAST AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD DINED AND THE FALSE FATIMA HAD BEEN SENT FOR BY ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS HE AGAIN WAITED UPON HER
AND A GRUFF AND SURLY CUSTODIAN HE WAS TOO
GLOSSIN'S SITUATION WAS THEREFORE PERILOUS IN THE EXTREME FOR THE SCHEMES OF A LIFE OF VILLAINY SEEMED AT ONCE TO BE CRUMBLING AROUND AND ABOUT HIM
THE SLAVE OBEYED WENT OUT OF THE HALL AND NO SOONER GOT TO THE PALACE GATES THAN HE SAW THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN CALLED TO HIM AND SHOWING HIM THE OLD LAMP SAID GIVE ME A NEW LAMP FOR THIS THE MAGICIAN NEVER DOUBTED BUT THIS WAS THE LAMP HE WANTED
AND TO MAKE QUICKLY TWO OR THREE RAGOUTS BESIDES WHAT HE HAD ORDERED BUT BE SURE TO PUT NO SALT IN THEM
AND GOD FORGIVE YOU
FROM THENCE I RETURNED TO BAGDAD WHERE I REALIZED VAST SUMS FROM MY PEPPER WOOD OF ALOES AND PEARLS
THE VOICE REPLIED I WAS SAFE FOR MY BOX WAS FASTENED TO THEIR SHIP
YOU GENTLEMEN GET INTO IT
THIS INCLINATION INCREASED UPON ME EVERY DAY AND AT LENGTH I RESOLVED TO TRAVEL THITHER BY LAND FOLLOWING THE EDGE OF THE SHORE
WE ARE INHABITANTS OF THIS COUNTRY AND WATER OUR FIELDS FROM THIS RIVER WHICH COMES OUT OF THE NEIGHBORING MOUNTAIN
HE HAD THE PATIENCE TO HEAR THE RELATION OF MY ADVENTURES WHICH SURPRISED HIM AND HE AFTERWARD GAVE ME CLOTHES AND COMMANDED CARE TO BE TAKEN OF ME
BUT YOU ARE SPARED BECAUSE THIS REQUEST DOES NOT COME FROM YOURSELF
AFTER HAVING LAIN SOME TIME AND SEEING THE ELEPHANTS GONE I GOT UP AND FOUND I WAS UPON A LONG AND BROAD HILL ALMOST COVERED WITH THE BONES AND TEETH OF ELEPHANTS
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY WENT TO THEM TELLING THEM BY HER TEARS THE CAUSE OF HER COMING
FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THE EMPEROR'S LARGEST HORSES EACH ABOUT FOUR INCHES AND AN HALF HIGH WERE EMPLOYED TO DRAW ME TOWARDS THE METROPOLIS WHICH AS I SAID WAS HALF A MILE DISTANT
AND WITH THAT HE BEAT THEM ALL THE WAY THITHER
THEY DRANK ALSO OF THE WATER OF THE RIVER WHICH WAS PLEASANT AND ENLIVENING TO THEIR WEARY SPIRITS
YOU SEE THEREFORE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF MY DOING WHAT YOU DESIRE WELL REPLIED THE ROBBER YOU MAY HOWEVER REMEMBER A LITTLE OF THE WAY THAT YOU WERE LED BLINDFOLD
AT LAST THEY ARRIVED BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS OF MODERATE HEIGHT AND EQUAL SIZE DIVIDED BY A NARROW VALLEY WHICH WAS THE PLACE WHERE THE MAGICIAN INTENDED TO EXECUTE THE DESIGN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM FROM AFRICA TO CHINA
I SHOWED HIM A CORN THAT I HAD CUT OFF WITH MY OWN HAND FROM A MAID OF HONOR'S TOE
WHEN ALADDIN HAD EXAMINED EVERY PORTION OF THE PALACE AND PARTICULARLY THE HALL WITH THE FOUR-AND-TWENTY WINDOWS AND FOUND IT TO FAR EXCEED HIS FONDEST EXPECTATIONS HE SAID GENIE THERE IS ONE THING WANTING--A FINE CARPET FOR THE PRINCESS TO WALK UPON FROM THE SULTAN'S PALACE TO MINE
BOHUN HE SAID ADDRESSING ONE OF HIS ATTENDANT KNIGHTS DO THINE OFFICE THE OFFICER STEPPED FORWARD AND LAYING HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF ALBERT DE MALVOISIN SAID I ARREST THEE OF HIGH TREASON WHO DARES TO ARREST A KNIGHT OF THE TEMPLE IN MY PRESENCE SAID THE GRAND MASTER
HOWEVER I WENT DOWN THUS TWO OR THREE DAYS AND HAVING SEEN NOTHING I BEGAN TO BE A LITTLE BOLDER AND TO THINK THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING IN IT BUT MY OWN IMAGINATION
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT LILLIPUT THE COMPLEXIONS OF THOSE DIMINUTIVE PEOPLE APPEARED TO ME THE FAIREST IN THE WORLD
AND DRANK OF THE WATER WHICH WAS VERY LIGHT AND GOOD
THE PALER BALAS RUBIES
AND I WILL WIND THEE IN MY ARMS FROM THE PAINTING BY ARTHUR RACKHAM THE JUNIOR CLASSICS SELECTED AND ARRANGED BY WILLIAM PATTEN MANAGING EDITOR OF THE HARVARD CLASSICS INTRODUCTION BY CHARLES W
AMONGST THOSE WHO PARTOOK OF THE FOREST HOSPITALITY OF THE OUTLAWS WERE IVANHOE AND GURTH WHO JUST THEN CAME ON THE SCENE THE FORMER NOW ALL BUT CURED OF HIS WOUND THANKS TO THE HEALING BALSAM WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY REBECCA THE JEWESS
BUT ALADDIN WAS INCORRIGIBLE AND HIS FATHER TO HIS GREAT GRIEF WAS FORCED TO ABANDON HIM TO HIS IDLENESS AND WAS SO MUCH TROUBLED ABOUT HIM THAT HE FELL SICK AND DIED IN A FEW MONTHS
HE SAW ALSO THAT IN THE DOOR-WAY STOOD MANY MEN IN ARMOUR TO KEEP IT BEING RESOLVED TO DO THE MEN THAT WOULD ENTER WHAT HURT AND MISCHIEF THEY COULD
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR SUCH REFLECTIONS NOW
SHE WAS ATTENDED BY A GREAT CROWD OF LADIES SLAVES AND MUTES WHO WALKED ON EACH SIDE AND BEHIND HER
THE BOAT WAS CAST ON AN ISLAND AND PROSPERO AND HIS LITTLE ONE LANDED IN SAFETY
THEY ARE SEEN THREE DAYS SAIL OFF AT SEA
MY SERVANTS THOUGHT SHE HAD FOLLOWED ME
AND I MAY SAY WITH TRUTH THAT IN THE MIDST OF MY OWN MISFORTUNES I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAMENTING MY POOR NURSE THE GRIEF SHE WOULD SUFFER FOR MY LOSS THE DISPLEASURE OF THE QUEEN AND THE RUIN OF HER FORTUNE
I MAUN FOOTNOTE
ON THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER IN THOSE PARTS THE WEATHER BEING VERY HAZY THE SEAMEN SPIED A ROCK WITHIN HALF A CABLE'S LENGTH OF THE SHIP
AS BOIS-GUILBERT ROLLED ON THE FIELD HIS ANTAGONIST SPRUNG FROM HORSEBACK AND WAS IN THE ACT OF COMMANDING HIS ADVERSARY TO YIELD OR DIE WHEN PRINCE JOHN GAVE THE SIGNAL THAT THE CONFLICT WAS AT AN END
AND IN JOINING HIS HANDS TO PRAY HE RUBBED THE RING WHICH THE MAGICIAN HAD PUT ON HIS FINGER
WHEN I CAME BACK I RESOLVED TO SETTLE IN LONDON TO WHICH MR BATES MY MASTER ENCOURAGED ME AND BY HIM I WAS RECOMMENDED TO SEVERAL PATIENTS
THE ARCHITECT WHO BUILT YOUR PALACE CAN GET YOU ONE AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD THANKED THE FALSE FATIMA FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVED HER GOOD ADVICE SHE CONVERSED WITH HER UPON OTHER MATTERS
I FELL WITH THE TREE AND THE ELEPHANT TAKING ME UP WITH HIS TRUNK LAID ME ON HIS BACK WHERE I SAT MORE LIKE ONE DEAD THAN ALIVE WITH MY QUIVER ON MY SHOULDER
THEY SEEMED VERY THANKFUL FOR IT AND SAID THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER VENTURE TO STAY THERE THAN BE CARRIED TO ENGLAND TO BE HANGED
BUT ARIEL BROUGHT HIM SAFE ASHORE
NOW I BEHELD IN MY DREAM THAT THEY HAD NOT JOURNEYED FAR BUT THE RIVER AND THE WAY FOR A TIME PARTED
LET MY DAUGHTER REBECCA GO FORTH TO YORK AND SHE WILL BRING THE TREASURE HERE THY DAUGHTER SAID FRONT-DE-BOEUF AS IF SURPRISED
AS THIS WAS ALSO ABOUT HALF-WAY BETWEEN MY OTHER HABITATION AND THE PLACE WHERE I HAD LAID UP MY BOAT I GENERALLY STAYED AND LAY HERE IN MY WAY THITHER FOR I USED FREQUENTLY TO VISIT MY BOAT
HERE THEREFORE CHRISTIAN AND HIS COMPANION WALKED WITH GREAT DELIGHT
THE DEBTS OF THE LAIRD BECAME AT LENGTH SO MANY THAT THE PROPERTY AT ELLANGOWAN HAD TO BE MORTGAGED AND THINGS ULTIMATELY WENT SO BADLY WITH THE POOR OWNER THAT THE MEN TO WHOM HE OWED SO MUCH MONEY DETERMINED TO INSIST ON THE ESTATE BEING SOLD TOGETHER WITH THE HOUSE AND ALL THE FURNITURE
I AM ROBIN HOOD OF SHERWOOD FOREST BEFORE MANY MORE MINUTES HAD GONE A SYLVAN REPAST WAS HASTILY PREPARED BENEATH A HUGE OAK-TREE FOR THE KING OF ENGLAND
BUT REBECCA REJECTED HIS PROFFERED LOVE WITH SCORN PROTESTING THAT SHE WOULD PROCLAIM HIS VILLAINY FROM ONE END OF EUROPE TO THE OTHER
HE WENT INTO THAT OF THE DRUGGISTS AND ENTERING ONE OF THE LARGEST AND BEST FURNISHED SHOPS ASKED THE DRUGGIST IF HE HAD A CERTAIN POWDER WHICH HE NAMED
UPON THIS HE CALLED ALOUD TO THE BOAT AND BADE HIS MEN BRING THE THINGS ASHORE THAT WERE FOR THE GOVERNOR
I WAS AFRAID OF TRAMPLING ON EVERY TRAVELLER I MET AND OFTEN CALLED ALOUD TO THEM TO HAVE THEM STAND OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT I HAD LIKE TO HAVE GOTTEN ONE OR TWO BROKEN HEADS FOR MY IMPERTINENCE
HE DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT THE QUEEN'S AFFECTION BUT HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HAVING FAIRIES TO WAIT ON HIM
AND TRULY AS TO MYSELF I THOUGHT IT WOULD NOT BE FOR MY REPUTATION THAT SUCH A STORY SHOULD GO ABOUT
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BUT RECOVERED MYSELF WITH THE SATISFACTORY REFLECTION THAT I HAD LOST NO TIME NOR ABATED ANY DILIGENCE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF HER THAT COULD BE USEFUL TO ME
FROM THIS LITTLE WICKET-GATE AND FROM THE WAY THERETO HATH THIS WICKED MAN TURNED THEE TO THE BRINGING OF THEE ALMOST TO DESTRUCTION
THEY TOLD HIM THEY WERE PILGRIMS AND THAT THEY HAD LOST THEIR WAY
WHEN THE THREE PERSONS CAME TO THE CREEK I FOUND THAT TWO OF THEM COULD SWIM BUT THE THIRD COULD NOT AND THAT STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE HE LOOKED AT THE OTHERS BUT WENT NO FARTHER AND SOON AFTER WENT SOFTLY BACK AGAIN
FOR THOUGH I SWAM VERY WELL YET I COULD NOT DELIVER MYSELF FROM THE WAVES SO AS TO DRAW BREATH TILL THAT WAVE HAVING DRIVEN ME OR RATHER CARRIED ME A VAST WAY ON TOWARD THE SHORE AND HAVING SPENT ITSELF WENT BACK AND LEFT ME UPON THE LAND ALMOST DRY BUT HALF DEAD WITH THE WATER I TOOK IN
AND TALKING UPON THE SUBJECT WITH A PERSON OF LEARNING THERE WHO WAS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF MINE HE SAID THAT MY FACE APPEARED MUCH FAIRER AND SMOOTHER WHEN HE LOOKED ON ME FROM THE GROUND THAN IT DID UPON A NEARER VIEW WHEN I TOOK HIM UP IN MY HAND AND BROUGHT HIM CLOSE WHICH HE CONFESSED WAS AT FIRST A VERY SHOCKING SIGHT
ONE DAY HOWEVER AN OFFICER OF THE CALIPH'S INQUIRED FOR ME
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN TO THE INTERPRETER BUT ARE THERE NO HOPES FOR SUCH A MAN AS THIS
THE VILLAGE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH SNOW OVERNIGHT
THE CEREMONY IS PERFORMED IN HIS MAJESTY'S GREAT CHAMBER OF STATE WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE TO UNDERGO A TRIAL OF DEXTERITY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER AND SUCH AS I HAVE NOT OBSERVED THE LEAST RESEMBLANCE OF IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY OF THE OLD OR NEW WORLD
AND WHERE SIR SAID I IS YOUR BELIEF OF MY BEING PRESERVED HERE ON PURPOSE TO SAVE YOUR LIFE WHICH ELEVATED YOU A LITTLE WHILE AGO
THE SHIP WORE BRAVELY
SEIZE THEM SHE INSTANTLY SPRANG THE PARTRIDGES
BUT AFTER A TIME HE RECOVERED HIS SELF-POSSESSION AND THEN SET HIMSELF TO DISCOVER IF BERTRAM WHOM HE RECOGNISED HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN IDENTITY
THAT IS HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE I WILL PAY IT WITH THE HELP OF MY BRETHREN
THERE BELONGS TO THIS KING AN ISLAND NAMED CASSEL
HE CLIMBED UP A LARGE TREE PLANTED ON A HIGH ROCK WHOSE BRANCHES WERE THICK ENOUGH TO CONCEAL HIM AND YET ENABLED HIM TO SEE ALL THAT PASSED WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED
I SLEPT ABOUT EIGHT HOURS AS I WAS AFTERWARDS ASSURED
I CONJURE THEE BY THE HABIT WHICH THOU DOST WEAR BY THE NAME THOU DOST INHERIT BY THE HONOUR OF THY MOTHER I CONJURE THEE TO SAY ARE THESE THINGS TRUE ANSWER HER BROTHER SAID THE GRAND MASTER
SO GREAT WAS HER SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE THAT SHE UNDERTOOK TO RESTORE THE INJURED KNIGHT TO HEALTH IN EIGHT DAYS TIME
AND AS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW OFFERS I WILL WITH YOUR LEAVE RELATE THE DANGERS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED WHICH I THINK WILL NOT BE UNINTERESTING TO YOU THE FIRST VOYAGE MY FATHER WAS A RICH MERCHANT
I WAS THOROUGHLY GLAD TO GET HER BACK AGAIN
I FELL INTO A HIGHROAD FOR SO I TOOK IT TO BE THOUGH IT SERVED TO THE INHABITANTS ONLY AS A FOOTPATH THROUGH A FIELD OF BARLEY
LORD'S SAKE CAPTAIN
THE SKIN OF A SERPENT WHOSE SCALES WERE AS BRIGHT AS AN ORDINARY PIECE OF GOLD AND HAD THE VIRTUE TO PRESERVE FROM SICKNESS THOSE WHO LAY UPON IT
ON THE MORNING AFTER THE RESTORATION OF ALADDIN'S PALACE THE SULTAN WAS LOOKING OUT OF HIS WINDOW AND MOURNING OVER THE FATE OF HIS DAUGHTER WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE SAW THE VACANCY CREATED BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PALACE TO BE AGAIN FILLED UP
AND WHEN THEY WERE WEARY SOME OF THEIR PAGES WOULD BLOW MY SAIL FORWARD WITH THEIR BREATH WHILE I SHOWED MY ART BY STEERING STARBOARD OR LARBOARD AS I PLEASED
WELL UNCLE WHAT IS TO BE DONE
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN TO HIS FELLOW IF THIS MEADOW LIETH ALONG BY OUR WAY-SIDE LET'S GO OVER INTO IT
YOU MUST ATTEND THIS GENTLEMAN SAID THE QUEEN
TO THE CHILD IT IS A FASCINATING FAIRY TALE
FRONT-DE-BOEUF AND ATHELSTANE HAVING DEFEATED THOSE IMMEDIATELY OPPOSED TO THEM WERE NOW FREE TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FRIEND THE TEMPLAR
WHERE LYING DOWN BEHIND A HILLOCK I TOOK OUT MY SMALL PERSPECTIVE GLASS AND VIEWED THE ENEMY'S FLEET AT ANCHOR CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIFTY MEN-OF-WAR AND A GREAT NUMBER OF TRANSPORTS
I LIKEWISE BROKE MY RIGHT SHIN AGAINST THE SHELL OF A SNAIL WHICH I HAPPENED TO STUMBLE OVER AS I WAS WALKING ALONE AND THINKING OF POOR ENGLAND
AND ON ITS CONCLUSION SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED TO PROVE THE RISKS TO WHICH BOIS-GUILBERT EXPOSED HIMSELF IN ENDEAVOURING TO SAVE REBECCA FROM THE BLAZING CASTLE
I LIVED FOR SOME TIME THERE UPON MY BREAD AND WATER WHEN ONE DAY JUST AS IT WAS ON THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION I HEARD SOMETHING TREAD AND BREATHING OR PANTING AS IT MOVED
PENDING THIS TIME SO FULL OF TERROR AND ANXIETY FOR POOR REBECCA THE BLACK KNIGHT HAVING LEFT THE COMPANY OF THE GENEROUS OUTLAW HELD HIS WAY TO A NEIGHBOURING RELIGIOUS HOUSE TO WHICH THE WOUNDED IVANHOE HAD BEEN REMOVED WHEN THE CASTLE WAS TAKEN
AS THEY LOOKED ON HIM IN ASTONISHMENT THE EYES OPENED BUT THEY WERE FIXED AND GLAZED
ALI BABA'S WIFE WENT HOME SET THE MEASURE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD FILLED IT AND EMPTIED IT OFTEN UPON THE SOFA TILL SHE HAD DONE WHEN SHE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED TO FIND THE NUMBER OF MEASURES AMOUNTED TO SO MANY AS THEY DID AND WENT TO TELL HER HUSBAND WHO HAD ALMOST FINISHED DIGGING THE HOLE
BY REASON OF WHICH THE WAY OF GOING BACK WAS VERY DANGEROUS
IN A LITTLE TIME I OBSERVED THE NOISE AND FLUTTER OF WINGS TO INCREASE VERY FAST AND MY BOX WAS TOSSED UP AND DOWN LIKE A SIGN ON A WINDY DAY
THOU DIDST THE SAME TO ME AND YET I AM WILLING TO PASS BY ALL IF NOW THOU WILT YET TURN AGAIN AND GO BACK
WE INDEED CAME BOTH TOGETHER UNTIL WE CAME TO THE SLOUGH OF DISPOND INTO THE WHICH WE ALSO SUDDENLY FELL
I'LL NO LIVE TO SEE IT MAYBE
FOR THOUGH THE STORM WAS ABATED CONSIDERABLY YET THE SEA WENT DREADFULLY HIGH UPON THE SHORE AND MIGHT BE WELL CALLED DEN WILD ZEE AS THE DUTCH CALL THE SEA IN A STORM
I ATE MY BREAKFAST BEFORE THE SUN WAS UP
WHETHER INHABITED OR NOT INHABITED
BUT WE MUST RETURN TO BERTRAM AND HIS COMPANION IN THEIR UNPLEASANT ABODE IN THE PRISON
HE ANSWERED BECAUSE I KNOW NOT WHITHER TO GO
THIS AT LENGTH PUT ME UPON THINKING WHETHER IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE MYSELF A CANOE OR PERIAGUA SUCH AS THE NATIVES OF THOSE CLIMATES MAKE EVEN WITHOUT TOOLS OR AS I MIGHT SAY WITHOUT HANDS OF THE TRUNK OF A GREAT TREE
WHEN I ADVANCED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE CHANNEL THEY WERE YET IN MORE PAIN BECAUSE I WAS UNDER WATER TO MY NECK
AT LAST WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF HE RECEIVED THE PRESENT FROM ALADDIN'S MOTHER'S HAND SAYING HOW RICH
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE I COULD GET ON SHORE
BUT WHEN HE WAS CONVINCED THAT THE WINDOW WHICH SEVERAL WORKMEN HAD BEEN SO LONG ABOUT WAS FINISHED IN SO SHORT A TIME HE EMBRACED ALADDIN AND KISSED HIM BETWEEN HIS EYES
HOW IT CAME THITHER I KNEW NOT NOR COULD I IN THE LEAST IMAGINE
SHOTS WERE FIRED AND THE GLITTERING BROADSWORDS OF THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO FLASH IN THE AIR
NOW CHRISTIAN AND HIS FELLOW HEARD HIM FALL
AND HAVING PASSED THE NIGHT IN THE SAME UNPLEASANT WAY THEY WERE IN THE MORNING CONVEYED TO THE PALACE OF THE SULTAN
THAT WAS A FELON STROKE EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT AS THE HORSE FELL TO THE EARTH BEARING HIS RIDER ALONG WITH HIM
THE INNUMERABLE CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE THROUGH WHOM HE PASSED MADE THE AIR ECHO WITH THEIR ACCLAMATIONS ESPECIALLY EVERY TIME THE SIX SLAVES WHO CARRIED THE PURSES THREW HANDFULS OF GOLD AMONG THE POPULACE
ON THE VERGE OF A WOOD WAS AN EXTENSIVE MEADOW OF THE FINEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL GREEN TURF SURROUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY THE FOREST AND FRINGED ON THE OTHER BY STRAGGLING OAK-TREES
THERE I STUDIED PHYSIC TWO YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS KNOWING IT WOULD BE USEFUL IN LONG VOYAGES
HIS VERY AFFECTIONS WERE TIED TO ME LIKE THOSE OF A CHILD TO A FATHER AND I DARE SAY HE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED HIS LIFE TO SAVE MINE UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER
MITCHELL ONCE SAID
BUT NOW I AM SPEAKING OF THE PALACE PRAY HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
HE SAW ALSO UPON THE TOP THEREOF CERTAIN PERSONS WALKING WHO WERE CLOATHED ALL IN GOLD
I WAS AN HOUR WALKING TO THE END OF THIS FIELD WHICH WAS FENCED IN WITH A HEDGE OF AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET HIGH AND THE TREES SO LOFTY THAT I COULD MAKE NO COMPUTATION OF THEIR ALTITUDE
THERE ARE YOUR GOODS
HE APPEARED AS TALL AS AN ORDINARY SPIRE STEEPLE AND TOOK ABOUT TEN YARDS AT EVERY STRIDE AS NEAR AS I COULD GUESS
AFTER SOME TIME SPENT IN THIS WAY ONE OF THE PARTY WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN A PORTMANTEAU WHICH BROWN AT ONCE RECOGNISED AS THE ONE HE HAD LEFT IN THE CHAISE
AND BEING ADVISED TO ALTER MY CONDITION I MARRIED MISS MARY BURTON SECOND DAUGHTER TO MR EDMUND BURTON HOSIER IN NEWGATE STREET WITH WHOM I RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS FOR A PORTION
FIFTY ROBES OF RICH STUFF
IT IS A SIGN THAT HE LOVES YOU AND HAS SOME USE FOR YOUR SERVICE IN THE WORLD
WHEN HE REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVERN HE PRONOUNCED THE WORDS OPEN SESAME THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY OPENED AND WHEN HE WAS IN CLOSED UPON HIM
ALL THESE THINGS I SAY WHICH I OUGHT TO HAVE CONSIDERED WELL AND DID COME INTO MY THOUGHTS AFTERWARDS YET GAVE ME NO APPREHENSIONS AT FIRST AND MY HEAD RAN MIGHTILY UPON THE THOUGHT OF GETTING OVER TO THE SHORE
I ATTEMPTED TO RISE BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO STIR
ON HIS WAY HE HAPPENED TO MEET LITTLE BERTRAM WHO WAS WALKING WITH THE DOMINIE AND AS HE HAD OFTEN PROMISED TO GIVE THE CHILD A RIDE HE TOOK HIM UP ON HIS NAG AND RODE OFF TOWARDS THE POINT
THE PAIN MADE HIM BREAK OUT INTO A FRIGHTFUL YELL
HERE I WALKED ON FOR SOME TIME BUT COULD SEE LITTLE ON EITHER SIDE IT BEING NOW NEAR HARVEST AND THE CORN RISING AT LEAST FORTY FEET
THE VESSEL WAS AN ENGLISH MERCHANTMAN RETURNING FROM JAPAN BY THE NORTH AND SOUTH SEAS
WHEN HE CAME TO HIM HE STOOD LIKE ONE AMAZED LOOKING AT HIM TURNING HIM FIRST ON ONE SIDE THEN ON THE OTHER
HE HAD LOST THE ROAD TO KIPPLETRINGAN WHITHER HE WAS BOUND BUT WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND A GUIDE TO CONDUCT HIM THERE BEFORE HE HAD GONE COMPLETELY ASTRAY
THERE HE RUBBED HIS LAMP AND THE OBEDIENT GENIE APPEARED
AT THE UPPER END SAT A COMELY VENERABLE GENTLEMAN WITH A LONG WHITE BEARD AND BEHIND HIM STOOD A NUMBER OF OFFICERS AND DOMESTICS ALL READY TO ATTEND HIS PLEASURE
I WENT TO WORK UPON THIS BOAT THE MOST LIKE A FOOL THAT EVER MAN DID WHO HAD ANY OF HIS SENSES AWAKE
BUT HOWEVER MY BROTHER LET'S BE PATIENT AND ENDURE A WHILE
IT MEANS HE SAID IN A FALTERING VOICE THAT MY BROTHER RICHARD HAS OBTAINED HIS FREEDOM IT IS TIME THEN SAID FITZURSE HIS CONFIDENTIAL ATTENDANT TO DRAW OUR PARTY TO A HEAD AND PREPARE OUR FORCES TO MEET HIM IN SULLEN ILL-HUMOUR THE PRINCE LEFT THE PLACE OF TOURNAMENT TO HOLD HIGH FESTIVAL AT THE CASTLE OF ASHBY
UPON THIS I PREPARED TO GO ON BOARD THE SHIP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS WORK I FINISHED MY FOURTH YEAR IN THIS PLACE AND KEPT MY ANNIVERSARY WITH THE SAME DEVOTION AND WITH AS MUCH COMFORT AS EVER BEFORE
I THEN CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE AND GAVE ORDER FOR WHICH I HAD A WARRANT FOR A GREAT QUANTITY OF THE STRONGEST CABLE AND BARS OF IRON
THE SUDDEN SOUND MADE THE MURDERERS BEAR BACK ONCE MORE AND WAMBA DID NOT HESITATE TO RUSH IN AND ASSIST HIS KNIGHT TO RISE
THIS I TOOK TO BE A GOOD OMEN AND WENT TO THEM WITHOUT ANY SCRUPLE
THE ROBBER AT HIS RETURN TO HIS COMPANY VALUED HIMSELF MUCH ON THE PRECAUTION HE HAD TAKEN WHICH HE LOOKED UPON AS AN INFALLIBLE WAY OF DISTINGUISHING ALI BABA'S HOUSE FROM THE OTHERS
AND UPON DEBATE WITH MYSELF I CONCLUDED THAT THIS ISLAND WHICH WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY PLEASANT FRUITFUL AND NO FARTHER FROM THE MAINLAND THAN AS I HAD SEEN WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY ABANDONED AS I MIGHT IMAGINE
RASPE SHOOTING A STAG WITH CHERRYSTONES R
BUT PLEASE DON'T LET ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE DISTURB ME
BEFORE DESCRIBING HOW THE SALE TOOK PLACE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO TELL SOMETHING OF GUY MANNERING WHO AS WILL BE REMEMBERED HAD LEFT ELLANGOWAN SHORTLY AFTER THE DAY THAT YOUNG HARRY BERTRAM WAS BORN
ILL MET BY MOONLIGHT PROUD TITANIA SAID THE KING
MOST UNWILLING WAS HIS TESTIMONY AND GIVEN WITH MANY TEARS
HOW BEAUTIFUL AFTER HE HAD ADMIRED AND HANDLED ALL THE JEWELS ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE TURNED TO HIS GRAND VIZIER AND SHOWING HIM THE DISH SAID BEHOLD
AND IT WAS GREEN ALL THE YEAR LONG
I SWEAR BY EARTH AND SEA AND SKY I WILL OFFER THEE NO OFFENCE
OFFERING ME AT THE SAME TIME BUT UNDER THE STRICTEST CONFIDENCE HIS GRACIOUS PROTECTION IF I WOULD CONTINUE IN HIS SERVICE
AND I WENT HOME AGAIN FILLED WITH THE BELIEF THAT SOME MAN OR MEN HAD BEEN ON SHORE THERE
YOUR SUPPER WILL BE SPOILED IF I KEEP IT BACK SO LONG DO NOT BE ANGRY MORGIANA REPLIED ALI BABA
SO I RETIRED IN THE DARK FROM THEM THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SEE WHAT KIND OF A GOVERNOR THEY HAD AND CALLED THE CAPTAIN TO ME
OR THAT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HE MAY FORGET TO LOCK US IN
WITH A TREMBLING HAND HE PRODUCED FROM HIS BOSOM A SMALL BOX OF OINTMENT BEARING SOME HEBREW CHARACTERS UPON THE LID WHICH WAS WITH MOST OF THE AUDIENCE A SURE PROOF THAT THE DEVIL HAD STOOD APOTHECARY
HAVING GOT MY SECOND CARGO ON SHORE--THOUGH I WAS FAIN TO OPEN THE BARRELS OF POWDER AND BRING THEM BY PARCELS FOR THEY WERE TOO HEAVY BEING LARGE CASKS--I WENT TO WORK TO MAKE ME A LITTLE TENT WITH THE SAIL AND SOME POLES WHICH I CUT FOR THAT PURPOSE AND INTO THIS TENT I BROUGHT EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW WOULD SPOIL EITHER WITH RAIN OR SUN
SHORTLY AFTER HER DEPARTURE ALADDIN MOUNTING HIS HORSE AND ATTENDED BY HIS RETINUE OF MAGNIFICENT ATTENDANTS LEFT HIS PATERNAL HOME FOREVER AND WENT TO THE PALACE IN THE SAME POMP AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
IT HAS A HORN UPON ITS NOSE ABOUT A CUBIT IN LENGTH
TO SAVE THE DUKE FROM HIS ENEMIES WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT MUCH COULD BE DONE TO REMIND HIM OF A SUBJECT'S LOVE
APOLLYON THEREFORE FOLLOWED HIS WORK AMAIN AND CHRISTIAN AGAIN TOOK COURAGE AND RESISTED AS MANFULLY AS HE COULD
HERMIA'S FATHER WAS SO ANGRY WITH HER FOR REFUSING TO DO AS HE WISHED THAT HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT HER BEFORE THE DUKE OF ATHENS TO ASK THAT SHE MIGHT BE KILLED IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO OBEY HIM
DESCEND MY SON SAID THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN THOSE STEPS AND OPEN THAT DOOR
HE CONSIDERED AWHILE WITH THE CAUTION OF ONE WHO ENDEAVORS TO LAY HOLD ON A SMALL DANGEROUS ANIMAL IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT SHALL NOT BE ABLE EITHER TO SCRATCH OR BITE HIM AS I MYSELF HAVE SOMETIMES DONE WITH A WEASEL IN ENGLAND
WHEN HE GOT WITHIN HIS MOTHER'S DOOR THE JOY TO SEE HER AND HIS WEAKNESS FOR WANT OF SUSTENANCE MADE HIM SO FAINT THAT HE REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME AS DEAD
MORGIANA REMEMBERING ALI BABA'S ORDERS GOT HIS BATHING LINEN READY AND ORDERED ABDALLA TO SET ON THE POT FOR THE BROTH
I WAS COVERED AGAIN WITH WATER A GOOD WHILE BUT NOT SO LONG BUT I HELD IT OUT
AND THESE WERE ANSWERED BY A FURIOUS DISCHARGE OF WHIZZING SHAFTS AND MISSILES FROM THE WALLS
IN A WORD TO TRY THEM AND TELL ME WHETHER HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE TRUSTED OR NOT TO GO ON BOARD AND SURPRISE THE SHIP
WHEN IT BECAME QUITE DARK HE PULLED THE LAMP OUT OF HIS BREAST AND RUBBED IT
THE CAPTAIN HAVING LOST TWO BRAVE FELLOWS OF HIS TROOP WAS AFRAID OF DIMINISHING IT TOO MUCH BY PURSUING THIS PLAN TO GET INFORMATION OF THE RESIDENCE OF THEIR PLUNDERER
BY THIS TIME I FOUND MY STRENGTH GONE AND DESPAIRED OF SAVING MY LIFE WHEN HAPPILY A WAVE THREW ME ON AN ISLAND
I NOW BEGAN TO BE WEARY AND SEEING NOTHING TO ENTERTAIN MY CURIOSITY I RETURNED GENTLY DOWN TOWARD THE CREEK
THE PLATES OF IRON FASTENED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX FOR THOSE WERE THE STRONGEST PRESERVED THE BALANCE WHILE IT FELL AND HINDERED IT FROM BEING BROKEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
AND THE TERRIBLE SCENE CAME BACK TO HIS MIND WITH ALL ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS OF HORROR AS HE STEALTHILY APPROACHED THE CAVERN
OUR VOYAGE WAS VERY PROSPEROUS BUT I SHALL NOT TROUBLE THE READER WITH A JOURNAL OF IT
AND THAT IF SO I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THEM COME AGAIN IN GREATER NUMBERS AND DEVOUR ME
THIS AGREEABLE RETREAT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO ME AFTER MY MISFORTUNES AND THE KINDNESS OF THIS GENEROUS PRINCE COMPLETED MY SATISFACTION
BUT THE KINDNESS OF SOME NEIGHBOURS NAMED MAC-MORLAN TO SOME EXTENT ASSUAGED THE MISERY OF HER POSITION
ABOUT NOON THE ROBBERS VISITED THEIR CAVE
THOU KNOWEST THAT FOR THE MOST PART HIS SERVANTS COME TO AN ILL END BECAUSE THEY ARE TRANSGRESSORS AGAINST ME AND MY WAYS
FIRST IN THE MANNER OF MY OWN COUNTRY AND AFTERWARDS IN THE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY THEIR LAWS WHICH WAS TO HOLD MY RIGHT FOOT IN MY LEFT HAND AND TO PLACE THE MIDDLE FINGER OF MY RIGHT HAND ON THE CROWN OF MY HEAD AND MY THUMB ON THE TIP OF MY RIGHT EAR
AND IT AFFORDED ME A GREAT MANY CURIOUS SPECULATIONS AFTERWARDS WHEN I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY FIRST SURPRISE
WHENEVER THE GIPSY WOMAN ADDRESSED THEM SHE SPOKE ANGRILY TO THEM
BECAUSE THEY REPENTED HE FORGAVE THEM AND TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS LIFE SINCE THEY HAD CRUELLY COMMITTED HIM AND HIS BABY DAUGHTER TO THE MERCY OF WIND AND WAVES
WHICH THE MONKEY OBSERVING AND FINDING HIMSELF ALMOST ENCOMPASSED NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPEED ENOUGH WITH HIS THREE LEGS LET ME DROP ON A RIDGE TILE AND MADE HIS ESCAPE
BUT I WAS NOT SATISFIED STILL FOR WHILE THE SHIP SAT UPRIGHT IN THAT POSTURE I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF HER THAT I COULD
BUT THOUGH THIS BE SO YET SINCE THINGS PRESENT AND OUR FLESHLY APPETITE ARE SUCH NEAR NEIGHBORS ONE TO ANOTHER
THUS I LET FLY AT HIM AND HIT HIM JUST ON THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD BETWEEN HIS ANTLERS
THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON HOWEVER IN THE INN ON WHOM BROWN COULD NOT AVOID REPEATEDLY FIXING HIS EYES--A TALL WITCH-LIKE WOMAN
HE SENT HIM ALSO A RICH TABLET WHICH ACCORDING TO TRADITION BELONGED TO THE GREAT SOLOMON
I HAVE SO HARDENED MY HEART THAT I CANNOT REPENT
BID HIM TO LOOK AT THE STARS AS HE LOOKED AT THEM BEFORE AND TO DO WHAT I DESIRE HIM IN THE LETTER SHE THEN LED THE FRIGHTENED DOMINIE BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE WOODS FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AND ON REACHING THE COMMON TOLD HIM TO STAND STILL
THE ENEMY WAS ANNOUNCED TO BE UNDER THEIR VERY WALLS
THE GRAND VIZIER'S SON ELATED WITH THE HONOR OF BEING THE SULTAN'S SON-IN-LAW KEPT SILENCE ON HIS PART AND THE EVENTS OF THE NIGHT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO CAST THE LEAST GLOOM ON THE FESTIVITIES ON THE FOLLOWING DAY IN CONTINUED CELEBRATION OF THE ROYAL MARRIAGE
GLOSSIN THEN DISCOVERED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS YOUNG BERTRAM IN REALITY WHO HAD WOUNDED HAZLEWOOD
I LAY ALL THIS WHILE AS THE READER MAY BELIEVE IN GREAT UNEASINESS
I QUICKLY PERCEIVED THAT I WAS MISSPENDING MY TIME WHICH IS OF ALL THINGS THE MOST VALUABLE
MY NEXT CARE WAS FOR SOME AMMUNITION AND ARMS
HE WANDERED AMONGST THE RUINS OF THE COTTAGES WHERE HE FOUND NO ONE ALTHOUGH HE NOTICED THE REMAINS OF A FIRE IN ONE OF THE HUTS
I AM TORMENTED WITH A VIOLENT PAIN IN MY HEAD AND REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT REFUSE ME THAT CURE WHICH YOU IMPART TO AFFLICTED PERSONS SO SAYING HE ROSE BUT HELD DOWN HIS HEAD
FOR WITHOUT THESE I WAS NOT ABLE TO ENJOY THE FEW COMFORTS I HAD IN THE WORLD I COULD NOT WRITE OR EAT OR DO SEVERAL THINGS WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE WITHOUT A TABLE
THOU ART THE FIRST I HAVE SEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS BY WHOM GOD WAS FEARED OR MAN REGARDED
FOR PRESENT DELIVERANCE THEY DO NOT MUCH EXPECT IT FOR THEY STAY FOR THEIR GLORY AND THEN THEY SHALL HAVE IT WHEN THEIR PRINCE COMES IN HIS AND THE GLORY OF THE ANGELS
SO WE SET VIGOROUSLY TO OUR BUSINESS
TWO STRANGE ADVENTURES IN RUSSIA BY R
HE MADE LACES TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND READ THE BIBLE AND FOX'S BOOK OF MARTYRS
THEN I MEASURED THE DISTANCE OF GROUND AND RESOLVED TO CUT A DOCK OR CANAL TO BRING THE WATER UP TO THE CANOE SEEING I COULD NOT BRING THE CANOE DOWN TO THE WATER
WHAT I WISHED BUT HARDLY HOPED OR EXPECTED HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER
FOR HE SAID I KNOW NOT BUT SOME OTHER ENEMY MAY BE AT HAND
ANOTHER INMATE OF THE NEW HOUSE WAS THE DOMINIE FOR WHOM COLONEL MANNERING HAD A LIKING AND WHO HE KNEW COULD NOT BEAR TO BE PARTED ALTOGETHER FROM MISS BERTRAM WHOSE TUTOR HE HAD BEEN FROM HER EARLIEST DAYS
AND WHEN I BEGAN TO ENTER UPON IT AND CALCULATE HOW DEEP IT WAS TO BE DUG HOW BROAD HOW THE STUFF WAS TO BE THROWN OUT I FOUND THAT BY THE NUMBER OF HANDS I HAD BEING NONE BUT MY OWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN TEN OR TWELVE YEARS BEFORE I COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH IT
WE RECEIVE YOUR LETTER WITH JOY AND SEND YOU FROM OUR IMPERIAL RESIDENCE THE GARDEN OF SUPERIOR WITS
GLOSSIN HAD NEVER BEEN NEAR THIS SPOT SINCE THE DAY ON WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE KENNEDY WAS MURDERED
THAT IF THE CAPTAIN HAD CARRIED THEM AWAY THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE HANGED
AND THEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT AGAIN WORKED QUITE OUT AND MADE ME A DOOR TO COME OUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY PALE OR FORTIFICATION
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT THE SHINING MEN BID THEM CALL AT THE GATE
FOR YOUR MIND BEING TROUBLED MAY LEAD YOU OUT OF THE WAY AGAIN
SO THIS WORTHY LORD WHOSE NAME WAS GONZALO SECRETLY PLACED IN THE BOAT SOME FRESH WATER PROVISIONS AND CLOTHES AND WHAT PROSPERO VALUED MOST OF ALL SOME OF HIS PRECIOUS BOOKS
I AND FIVE OF MY COMRADES WERE CARRIED TO ONE PLACE
WAS I NOT THE MAN YES SAID BERTRAM STARTING FROM HIS SEAT AS IF A SUDDEN LIGHT HAD BURST IN UPON HIS MIND
BUT PREVAILED THAT THE ARTICLES AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH I SHOULD BE SET FREE AND TO WHICH I MUST SWEAR SHOULD BE DRAWN UP BY HIMSELF
I PLAINLY HEARD A NOISE UPON THE COVER OF MY CLOSET LIKE THAT OF A CABLE AND THE GRATING OF IT AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE RING
I FORGOT NOT TO LIFT UP MY HEART IN THANKFULNESS TO HEAVEN
AFTER HAVING TESTIFIED THEIR JOY AT MY ESCAPING SO MANY DANGERS THEY BROUGHT ME THE BEST OF THEIR PROVISIONS
YET OUR EMPEROR STANDING UPON THE ADVANTAGE HE HAD GOT BY THE SEIZURE OF THEIR FLEET OBLIGED THEM TO DELIVER THEIR CREDENTIALS AND MAKE THEIR SPEECH IN THE LILLIPUTIAN TONGUE
AND WHEN HE CAME TO THAT WHICH HAD THE OIL IN FOUND IT PRODIGIOUSLY SUNK AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME MOTIONLESS SOMETIMES LOOKING AT THE JARS AND SOMETIMES AT MORGIANA WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SO GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
YET IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE SAVED OUR LIVES OUR PROVISIONS AND THE BEST OF OUR GOODS
STANDING SO HOWEVER THAT MY HEAD DID NOT APPEAR ABOVE THE HILL SO THAT THEY COULD NOT PERCEIVE ME BY ANY MEANS
THEN THEY PLACED HER ON AN OPEN BIER AND BEGAN THEIR MARCH TO THE PLACE OF BURIAL
BUT NOW I AM ABOUT TO IMPOSE ON THEE A HARDER TASK
AND YOU WILL NOT DOUBT IT WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I SEWED THE BODY OF A DEAD MAN TOGETHER IN A PLACE WHERE I HAD NOT SO MUCH LIGHT AS I HAVE NOW A DEAD BODY EXCLAIMED THE ROBBER WITH AFFECTED AMAZEMENT
DO NOT DESIRE TO GO OUT OF THE WOOD SAID TITANIA
AFTER I HAD RETURNED HIM A THOUSAND THANKS FOR ALL HIS FAVORS I WENT ABOARD
THEY ALSO REFERRED TO A MURDER COMMITTED SOME TWENTY YEARS BEFORE IN WHICH THEIR DEAD COMPANION HAD HAD A HAND
I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE IT KEPT ENTIRE LEST THE GOATS SHOULD BREAK THROUGH THAT I NEVER LEFT OFF TILL WITH INFINITE LABOR I HAD STUCK THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEDGE SO FULL OF SMALL STAKES AND SO NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER THAT IT WAS RATHER A PALE THAN A HEDGE AND THERE WAS SCARCE ROOM TO PUT A HAND THROUGH BETWEEN THEM
TAKE YOUR POUND OF FLESH BUT REMEMBER THAT IF YOU TAKE MORE OR LESS EVEN BY THE WEIGHT OF A HAIR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PROPERTY AND YOUR LIFE SHYLOCK NOW GREW VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED
I SHALL RETURN BY NOON AND WILL THEN TELL YOU WHAT MUST BE DONE BY YOU TO INSURE SUCCESS
HE SAID BY THE BEST COMPUTATION HE COULD MAKE WE WERE AT LEAST A HUNDRED LEAGUES
AND NEITHER THE SULTAN NOR THE GRAND VIZIER WHO HAD FORGOTTEN ALADDIN AND HIS REQUEST HAD THE LEAST THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ANY HAND IN THE STRANGE ADVENTURES THAT BEFEL THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
BUT I HAD GOT HOME TO MY LITTLE TENT WHERE I LAY WITH ALL MY WEALTH ABOUT ME VERY SECURE
HOWEVER THE BIRD WHO HAD ONLY BEEN STUNNED RECOVERING HIMSELF GAVE ME SO MANY BOXES WITH HIS WINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF MY HEAD AND BODY THOUGH I HELD HIM AT ARM'S LENGTH AND WAS OUT OF THE REACH OF HIS CLAWS THAT I WAS TWENTY TIMES THINKING TO LET HIM GO
THAT WHICH WAS OUR PRESENT COMFORT AND ALL THE COMFORT WE HAD WAS THAT CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION THE SHIP DID NOT BREAK YET AND THAT THE MASTER SAID THE WIND BEGAN TO ABATE
AND THAT IF THEY PROVED UNFAITHFUL IN THE EXECUTION THE FIVE HOSTAGES SHOULD BE HANGED IN CHAINS ALIVE ON THE SHORE
AS I APPROACHED THE BOTTOM I DISCOVERED BY THE AID OF THE LITTLE LIGHT THAT CAME FROM ABOVE THE NATURE OF THIS SUBTERRANEAN PLACE
BUT I WAS PRESENTLY CONVINCED HOW IT WAS
AND SOON AFTER A LOUD AND LONG FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS ANNOUNCED THAT THE COURT WERE SEATED FOR JUDGMENT
BUT THE CHAIRS CABINET AND BEDSTEAD BEING SCREWED TO THE FLOOR WERE MUCH DAMAGED BY THE IGNORANCE OF THE SEAMEN WHO TORE THEM UP BY FORCE
BUT HE WAS SO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH THOSE WHO ATTENDED ON ALL SIDES OF HIM THAT I PITIED HIM AND WONDERED AT HIS PATIENCE
GREAT THEN WAS THEIR SURPRISE TO FIND CASSIM'S BODY TAKEN AWAY WITH SOME OF THEIR BAGS OF GOLD
HE WAS THEN WELL RUBBED AND WASHED WITH VARIOUS SCENTED WATERS
THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE HAD LEARNED FROM HIS MAGIC BOOKS THE SECRET AND THE VALUE OF THIS WONDERFUL LAMP THE OWNER OF WHICH WOULD BE MADE RICHER THAN ANY EARTHLY RULER AND HENCE HIS JOURNEY TO CHINA
THE GIGANTIC FRONT-DE-BOEUF ARMED IN SABLE ARMOUR WAS THE FIRST WHO TOOK THE FIELD
I SPEAK NOT FOR ENDANGERING THE STEED AND COAT OF ARMOUR BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THINE OWN LIFE AND LIMBS GRAMERCY FOR THY CAUTION SAID THE PALMER SMILING
IT PRESENTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT WAS IN VAIN TO PRETEND TO MAKE A RAFT WITH THE WIND OFF SHORE
HE WAS DISOBEDIENT TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND WOULD GO OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING AND STAY OUT ALL DAY PLAYING IN THE STREETS AND PUBLIC PLACES WITH IDLE CHILDREN OF HIS OWN AGE
FOR THE CAPTAIN FALLING SICK OF AN AGUE WE COULD NOT LEAVE THE CAPE TILL THE END OF MARCH
AND RETURNING SHORTLY AFTER WHISPERED INTO THE EAR OF HIS MASTER
FORSWORN PRIEST
SO THE OTHER TOLD HIM THAT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE GATE HE WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE OF THE INTERPRETER AT WHOSE DOOR HE SHOULD KNOCK AND HE WOULD SHEW HIM EXCELLENT THINGS
JULIA MANNERING WHO HAD HAD NO INTIMATION THAT HER OLD LOVER WAS IN THE DISTRICT UTTERED A SCREAM WHEN SHE SUDDENLY SAW HIM STANDING BEFORE HER
THE MAGICIAN WANTED TO KNOW NO MORE
HE COMMENCED TO ADDRESS THE JEWESS WITH FLATTERING SPEECHES SAYING THAT HE LOVED HER AND THAT SHE MUST NOW BE HIS
BUT AS HE CAME DOWN FROM THE TERRACE SEEING IT WAS PERFECTLY DRY HE STOPPED IN THE GARDEN TO OBSERVE THE TREES WHICH WERE LOADED WITH EXTRAORDINARY FRUIT OF DIFFERENT COLORS ON EACH TREE
AND FOR THE FIRST TOKEN OF MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT GIVE YOU YOUR LIBERTY FROM THIS MOMENT TILL I CAN COMPLETE YOUR RECOMPENSE AS I INTEND ALI BABA'S GARDEN WAS VERY LONG AND SHADED AT THE FURTHER END BY A GREAT NUMBER OF LARGE TREES
I COULD SEE NO OTHER IMPRESSION BUT THAT ONE
HE WAS MUCH ALARMED WHEN HE SAW ME
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE WITH HIM THERE AND THEY HAD BECOME VERY INTIMATE WITH A YOUNG OFFICER IN THE SAME REGIMENT CALLED VANBEEST BROWN WHO IT WAS SUPPOSED HAD CAME FROM HOLLAND WHERE HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ENGAGED IN TRADE OF SOME KIND
THE CREW HAD MUTINIED AND BROUGHT THE CAPTAIN AND SEVERAL OF THE MEN ASHORE
A FEMALE SLAVE OF GREAT BEAUTY WHOSE ROBE WAS COVERED OVER WITH JEWELS
BUT IN ORDER TO EXECUTE IT WITH MORE ART AND TO BE SECURE OF SUCCESS I TOLD HIM WE MUST DIVIDE THE PRISONERS AND THAT HE SHOULD GO AND TAKE ATKINS AND TWO MORE OF THE WORST OF THEM AND SEND THEM PINIONED TO THE CAVE WHERE THE OTHERS LAY
ALL THIS I WAS TOLD FOR WHILE THE WHOLE OPERATION WAS PERFORMING I LAY IN A PROFOUND SLEEP BY THE FORCE OF THAT SOPORIFEROUS MEDICINE INFUSED INTO MY LIQUOR
THE CHILDREN AND MOB CROWDING ABOUT HIM SO THAT HE CAN HARDLY STIR MAKE ALL THE NOISE THEY CAN IN DERISION OF HIM ANOTHER FEMALE SLAVE HEARING THIS SAID
WHEN BENDING MY EYES DOWNWARD AS MUCH AS I COULD I PERCEIVED IT TO BE A HUMAN CREATURE NOT SIX INCHES HIGH WITH A BOW AND ARROW IN HIS HANDS AND A QUIVER AT HIS BACK
HE THEN GREW SERIOUS AND DESIRED TO ASK ME FREELY WHETHER I WERE NOT TROUBLED IN MY MIND BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME ENORMOUS CRIME FOR WHICH I WAS PUNISHED AT THE COMMAND OF SOME PRINCE BY EXPOSING ME IN THAT CHEST
2
2
MY BODY SHALL BE CRUSHED OUT OF THE VERY FORM OF HUMANITY UPON THE STONES BELOW ERE IT BECOME THE VICTIM OF THY BRUTALITY THE TEMPLAR HESITATED AND A RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD HAVE NEVER YIELDED TO PITY OR DISTRESS GAVE WAY TO HIS ADMIRATION FOR HER FORTITUDE
NOW I WISHED FOR MY BOY XURY AND THE LONGBOAT WITH SHOULDER-OF MUTTON SAIL WITH WHICH I SAILED ABOVE A THOUSAND MILES ON THE COAST OF AFRICA
THE JUICE OF WHICH THE CAMPHIRE IS MADE EXUDES FROM A HOLE BORED IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TREE IS RECEIVED IN A VESSEL WHERE IT THICKENS TO A CONSISTENCY AND BECOMES WHAT WE CALL CAMPHIRE
INSTEAD OF TAKING MY WAY BY THE PERSIAN GULF I TRAVELLED ONCE MORE THROUGH SEVERAL PROVINCES OF PERSIA AND THE INDIES AND ARRIVED AT A SEAPORT WHERE I EMBARKED IN A SHIP THE CAPTAIN OF WHICH WAS BOUND ON A LONG VOYAGE IN WHICH HE AND THE PILOT LOST THEIR COURSE
HAVING BALANCED MY CARGO EXACTLY AND FASTENED IT WELL TO THE RAFT I WENT ON BOARD WITH TWO OARS THAT I HAD MADE AND LEAVING IT TO THE COURSE OF THE RIVER RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE WILL OF GOD
SO INSTEAD OF KEEPING ONE HAPPY COURT AND DANCING ALL NIGHT THROUGH IN THE MOONLIGHT AS IS FAIRIES USE THE KING WITH HIS ATTENDANTS WANDERED THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD WHILE THE QUEEN WITH HERS KEPT STATE IN ANOTHER
SO I AWOKE AND BEHOLD IT WAS A DREAM
AND WHEN I BURIED THE LAST I HAD SO LITTLE PROVISIONS REMAINING THAT I THOUGHT I COULD NOT LONG SURVIVE AND I DUG A GRAVE RESOLVING TO LIE DOWN IN IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO PAY ME THE LAST OFFICES OF RESPECT
THERE WAS NO RESISTANCE AND WHEN THE WORK WAS ENDED THE NOW HOMELESS TRIBE GATHERED TOGETHER THE REMNANTS OF THEIR PROPERTY AND SET FORTH WITH SULLEN AND REVENGEFUL THOUGHTS TO LOOK FOR A NEW SETTLEMENT
SHE ORDERED THE JOINER TO MAKE A WOODEN TROUGH OF THREE HUNDRED FEET LONG FIFTY BROAD AND EIGHT DEEP
SOME COMBINGS OF THE QUEEN'S HAIR
I AM NOT IN THE LEAST AMAZED SAID SHE TO HERSELF THAT THIS WICKED MAN WHO IS MY MASTER'S GREATEST ENEMY WOULD EAT NO SALT WITH HIM SINCE HE INTENDS TO ASSASSINATE HIM
HE TOOK THE NAME OF COGIA HOUSSAIN AND AS A NEWCOMER WAS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM EXTREMELY CIVIL AND COMPLAISANT TO ALL THE MERCHANTS HIS NEIGHBORS
CONFESS WHO SET THEE ON THIS TRAITOROUS DEED RICHARD ANSWERED THE FALLEN KNIGHT IT WAS THY FATHER'S SON RICHARD'S EYES SPARKLED WITH INDIGNATION BUT HIS BETTER NATURE OVERCAME IT
NOW A LITTLE BEFORE IT WAS DAY GOOD CHRISTIAN AS ONE HALF AMAZED BRAKE OUT IN PASSIONATE SPEECH
THERE BEING NO CHURCHMAN AMONGST THEM AND AS NO ONE ELSE SEEMED WILLING TO UNDERTAKE THE RISK OF TRUSTING HIMSELF WITHIN THE CASTLE WAMBA THE JESTER WAS SELECTED FOR THE OFFICE
WHEN THE SHIP WAS READY I WENT ON BOARD WITH MY GOODS
IT HAD BEEN DELAYED ON ITS WAY AND WAS NOW NO LONGER OF ANY USE
FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THIS MR BERTRAM CONTINUED TO LIVE A SOLITARY AND MOURNFUL LIFE AT ELLANGOWAN
AND HAVING DRUNK AND PUT A LITTLE TOBACCO IN MY MOUTH TO PREVENT HUNGER I WENT TO THE TREE AND GETTING UP INTO IT ENDEAVORED TO PLACE MYSELF SO THAT IF I SHOULD SLEEP I MIGHT NOT FALL
HE PAUSED AS HE CAME TO THE NAME OF THE SIXTH
BUT WHEN QUESTIONED SHE DENIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN AT THE PLACE
BUT HE TOLD HIS DAUGHTER THAT HE HAD TAKEN A PLACE NEAR KIPPLETRINGAN CALLED WOODBOURNE WHERE HE MEANT TO RESIDE FOR SOME TIME
IN THE MANNER OF A SEMICIRCLE AT A DISTANCE FROM MY WALL JUST WHERE I HAD PLANTED A DOUBLE ROW OF TREES ABOUT TWELVE YEARS BEFORE OF WHICH I MADE MENTION
ART NOT THOU THE MAN THAT I FOUND CRYING WITHOUT THE WALLS OF THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION
AND WE COULD HEAR THE FOREMOST OF THEM LONG BEFORE THEY CAME QUITE UP CALLING TO THOSE BEHIND TO COME ALONG AND COULD ALSO HEAR THEM ANSWER AND COMPLAIN HOW LAME AND TIRED THEY WERE AND NOT ABLE TO COME ANY FASTER WHICH WAS VERY WELCOME NEWS TO US
WHEN SHE CAME WITHIN THREE OR FOUR PACES OF THE DOOR OF THE BATH SHE TOOK OFF HER VEIL AND GAVE ALADDIN AN OPPORTUNITY OF A FULL VIEW OF HER FACE
HE ADDED THAT HIS SUSPICIONS WERE MUCH INCREASED BY SOME VERY ABSURD SPEECHES I HAD DELIVERED AT FIRST TO HIS SAILORS AND AFTERWARD TO HIMSELF IN RELATION TO MY CLOSET OR CHEST AS WELL AS BY MY ODD LOOKS AND BEHAVIOR WHILE I WAS AT SUPPER
YOU WILL BE BETTER INFORMED OF WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME AS SOON AS MORGIANA HAD SHUT THE DOOR ALI BABA FOLLOWED HER WHEN SHE REQUESTED HIM TO LOOK INTO THE FIRST JAR AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANY OIL
THEN SHOWING ME A GREAT TREE CLIMB UP THAT SAID HE AND SHOOT AT THE ELEPHANTS AS YOU SEE THEM PASS BY FOR THERE IS A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER OF THEM IN THIS FOREST AND IF ANY OF THEM FALL COME AND GIVE ME NOTICE HAVING SPOKEN THUS HE LEFT ME VICTUALS AND RETURNED TO THE TOWN AND I CONTINUED UPON THE TREE ALL NIGHT
A LONG PROCESSION FOLLOWED AND NEXT A GUARD OF WARDERS ON FOOT IN SABLE LIVERY AMIDST WHOM MIGHT BE SEEN THE PALE FORM OF THE ACCUSED MAIDEN
SQUIRES PAGES AND YEOMEN IN RICH LIVERIES WAITED AROUND THE PLACE OF HONOUR WHICH WAS DESIGNED FOR PRINCE JOHN THE BROTHER OF THE ABSENT KING AND HIS ATTENDANTS
AS THE TRAVELLERS APPROACHED THE ANCIENT SAXON FORTRESS THEY COULD SEE THE HUGE BLACK BANNER FLOATING FROM THE TOP OF THE TOWER WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT THE OBSEQUIES OF THE LATE OWNER WERE STILL IN THE ACT OF BEING SOLEMNIZED
BUT WHEN I SAW THAT I PRESENTED MY OTHER PIECE AT THE MAN AS IF I WOULD SHOOT HIM
AND SOME OF THEM HAD WALKED ROUND IT SEVERAL TIMES
THE ONLY LIGHT WITHIN THE CAVE WAS FROM A CHARCOAL FIRE THE DARK RED GLOW FROM WHICH GAVE A DISMAL AND UNEARTHLY APPEARANCE TO THE SMUGGLER'S HIDING PLACE
THEN I SAW THAT THERE WAS A WAY TO HELL EVEN FROM THE GATES OF HEAVEN AS WELL AS FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION
BUT THAT WHICH FIRST SURPRISED ME WAS THE LENGTH OF THE GRASS WHICH IN THOSE GROUNDS THAT SEEMED TO BE KEPT FOR HAY WAS ABOUT TWENTY FEET HIGH
BUT THAT TRUST WAS ILL-REWARDED FOR ANTONIO WANTED TO WEAR THE DUKE'S CROWN HIMSELF AND TO GAIN HIS ENDS WOULD HAVE KILLED HIS BROTHER BUT FOR THE LOVE THE PEOPLE BORE HIM
THE KNIGHT WHOM THE PRINCE SHOULD DECLARE TO BE THE VICTOR WAS TO RECEIVE AS PRIZE A WAR-HORSE OF EXQUISITE BEAUTY AND MATCHLESS STRENGTH AND IN ADDITION TO THIS REWARD HE SHOULD HAVE THE PECULIAR HONOUR OF NAMING THE QUEEN OF LOVE AND BEAUTY
DASHING HIM SEVERAL TIMES AGAINST THE GROUND IT CRUSHED HIM AND WE COULD HEAR IT GNAW AND TEAR THE POOR FELLOW'S BONES THOUGH WE HAD FLED TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE
FOR THE SAGACITY AND SMELL OF THIS BIRD ENABLE HIM TO DISCOVER HIS QUARRY AT A GREAT DISTANCE THOUGH BETTER CONCEALED THAN I COULD BE WITHIN A TWO-INCH BOARD
THE EMPEROR HIMSELF IN PERSON DID ME THE HONOR TO BE BY AT THE WHOLE CEREMONY
ONE CLOUDY NOVEMBER EVENING A YOUNG TRAVELLER GUY MANNERING BY NAME JUST COME FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WAS MAKING HIS WAY WITH DIFFICULTY OVER THE WILD AND LONELY MOORLAND WHICH EXTENDED FOR MANY MILES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE VILLAGE
FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO SALT EVER PUT INTO MY BREAD AND AS TO THE MEAT WE SHALL HAVE TO-NIGHT I PROMISE YOU THERE SHALL BE NONE IN THAT
AND THE YELLOW TOPAZES
THEN CHRISTIAN SMILED AND SAID I THINK VERILY I KNOW THE MEANING OF THIS
O NOW I CANNOT
AFTER EMBRACING AND SHEDDING TEARS OF JOY THEY SAT DOWN AND ALADDIN SAID I BEG OF YOU PRINCESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS BECOME OF AN OLD LAMP WHICH STOOD UPON A SHELF IN MY ROBING CHAMBER ALAS ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I WAS AFRAID OUR MISFORTUNE MIGHT BE OWING TO THAT LAMP
OH
NOW YOU SPEAK OF LAMPS I KNOW NOT WHETHER THE PRINCESS MAY HAVE OBSERVED IT BUT THERE IS AN OLD ONE UPON A SHELF OF THE PRINCE ALADDIN'S ROBING-ROOM AND WHOEVER OWNS IT WILL NOT BE SORRY TO FIND A NEW ONE IN ITS STEAD
AND HIS MOUTH WAS AS THE MOUTH OF A LION
IN THIS PLACE ALSO I HAD MY GRAPES GROWING WHICH I PRINCIPALLY DEPENDED ON FOR MY WINTER STORE OF RAISINS AND WHICH I NEVER FAILED TO PRESERVE VERY CAREFULLY AS THE BEST AND MOST AGREEABLE DAINTY OF MY WHOLE DIET
AND WHAT OF THAT SIR REPLIED BERTRAM
I HAD NOW FASTENED ALL THE HOOKS AND TAKING THE KNOT IN MY HAND BEGAN TO PULL BUT NOT A SHIP WOULD STIR FOR THEY WERE ALL TOO FAST HELD BY THEIR ANCHORS SO THAT THE BOLDEST PART OF MY ENTERPRISE REMAINED
HE TOOK UP HIS BOW AND ARROWS AND CAME BACK
AFTER THIS MANNER THEY LIVED TILL ALADDIN HAD SOLD THE TWELVE DISHES SINGLY AS NECESSITY PRESSED TO THE JEW FOR THE SAME MONEY
AND AS HE PUT ON HIS RAIMENT HE SHOOK AND TREMBLED
BUT I IMMEDIATELY RELIEVED THEM BOTH AND COVERING THE HOLE WITH ONE HAND I SET DOWN THE TROOP WITH THE OTHER IN THE SAME MANNER AS I TOOK THEM UP
I OFTEN LET MY LEGS DROP AND COULD FEEL NO BOTTOM
THE TREES THAT I CUT DOWN WERE LYING TO ROT ON THE GROUND
IN THIS KIND OF DRESS I WENT MY NEW JOURNEY AND WAS OUT FIVE OR SIX DAYS
ARE THERE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE SAID REBECCA
THE VOICES OF THE KNIGHTS WERE HEARD ANIMATING THEIR FOLLOWERS OR DIRECTING MEANS OF DEFENCE
AMONGST MR BERTRAM'S MOST INTIMATE COMPANIONS IN HIS RETIREMENT WAS ONE ABEL SAMPSON A TALL AND AWKWARD-LOOKING MAN WITH A HARSH VOICE AND HUGE FEET WHO WAS KNOWN TO THE PEOPLE AROUND AS THE DOMINIE HE WAS A MAN WHO SPOKE BUT LITTLE AND GENERALLY USED VERY LONG WORDS WHEN HE DID
FOR ME TO THINK OF SUCH A VOYAGE WAS THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS THING THAT EVER MAN IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES COULD BE GUILTY OF
BUT BY MEANS OF FURTHER PROMISES HE WAS INDUCED TO ALLOW DINMONT TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIS FRIEND
MY FATHER
AS GREAT CRIMINALS IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SEA IN A LEAKY VESSEL WITHOUT PROVISIONS
WHEREUPON I TOOK MY BLACK CATTLE AND SHEEP OUT OF MY POCKET WHICH AFTER GREAT ASTONISHMENT CLEARLY CONVINCED HIM OF MY VERACITY
HERE WILL I SPILL THY SOUL
HAZLEWOOD WHOSE HORSE WAS OUTSIDE THE CAVE THEN RODE OFF FOR ASSISTANCE AND AFTER SOME TIME RETURNED WITH SEVERAL OTHERS
AT MIDNIGHT GLOSSIN LOOKED OUT FROM HIS BEDROOM TOWARDS THE CASTLE AND AFTER WATCHING FOR SOME TIME IN AN AGONY OF GUILTY SUSPENSE HE SAW THE DARK FORM OF A MAN WHOM HE KNEW TO BE HATTERAICK DROP FROM THE PRISON WINDOW AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE BEACH WHERE HE SUCCEEDED IN SHOVING OUT A BOAT WHICH WAS LYING THERE
THEY FILED OFF IN PARTIES OF TWO EACH AFTER SOME INTERVAL OF TIME AND GOT INTO THE TOWN WITHOUT BEING IN THE LEAST SUSPECTED
OF DESTROYING THE BIGENDIAN EXILES AND COMPELLING THAT PEOPLE TO BREAK THE SMALLER END OF THEIR EGGS BY WHICH HE WOULD REMAIN THE SOLE MONARCH OF THE WHOLE WORLD
WHEREIN I READILY OBLIGED THEM BUT SHALL NOT TROUBLE THE READER WITH THE PARTICULARS
THE EMPEROR LAYS ON THE TABLE THREE FINE SILKEN THREADS OF SIX INCHES LONG
HAZLEWOOD WHO HAD A GUN WITH HIM HAD OFFERED HIS ARM TO MISS MANNERING WHO WAS TIRED AFTER SKATING AS THEY WALKED TOWARDS HOME
FRIDAY MY LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
BUT MY SENSES BEING ENTIRE YOU MAY EASILY GUESS THAT INSTEAD OF GROWING FAT AS THE REST DID I GREW LEANER EVERY DAY
FOURTH THESE FIVE RELEASED AT LAST
I BEMOANED MY DESOLATE WIDOW AND FATHERLESS CHILDREN
HE THEREFORE THAT WENT BEFORE VAIN-CONFIDENCE BY NAME NOT SEEING THE WAY BEFORE HIM FELL INTO A DEEP PIT WHICH WAS ON PURPOSE THERE MADE BY THE PRINCE OF THOSE GROUNDS TO CATCH VAIN-GLORIOUS FOOLS WITHAL AND WAS DASHED IN PIECES WITH HIS FALL
MRS MANNERING DIED SHORTLY AFTER AND THE COLONEL AND HIS DAUGHTER RETURNED TO ENGLAND
FOR I NOW AND THEN FELT A SORT OF TUGGING WHICH MADE THE WAVES RISE NEAR THE TOPS OF MY WINDOWS LEAVING ME ALMOST IN THE DARK
AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER SHE TURNED FROM THE TRACK AND LED THE WAY UP A STEEP AND RUGGED PATH UNDER THE SNOW-LADEN TREES AND ON REACHING A PLACE SOME DISTANCE FARTHER ON SHE POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION OF KIPPLETRINGAN AND TOLD HER COMPANION TO MAKE WHAT SPEED HE COULD
AND AS HE WAS NOW REDUCED TO GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF FUNDS HE WROTE TO HIS STURDY FARMER FRIEND DANDIE DINMONT FOR THE LOAN OF A LITTLE MONEY
EACH BLACK SLAVE CARRIED ON HIS HEAD A BASIN OF MASSY GOLD FULL OF PEARLS DIAMONDS RUBIES AND EMERALDS
AFTER WE HAD RESIDED AT CEYLON ABOUT A FORTNIGHT I ACCOMPANIED ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROTHERS UPON A SHOOTING PARTY
HAROUN AL RASCHID WHO WAS CALLED THE JUST WAS A REAL EASTERN MONARCH WHO LIVED IN BAGDAD OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT CHARLEMAGNE WAS KING OF FRANCE
SOME DAYS AFTER HE ASKED ME IF I UNDERSTOOD ANY TRADE
ALADDIN WHO WAS NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF A FATHER GAVE HIMSELF ENTIRELY OVER TO HIS IDLE HABITS AND WAS NEVER OUT OF THE STREETS FROM HIS COMPANIONS
FOR THEY SAY THAT LIONS WILL NOT PREY ON ANYTHING THAT IS DEAD OR SLEEPING
BUT THEY SEARCHED LONG AND IN VAIN FOR ANY TRACE OF KENNEDY OR THE BOY
OTHERS LAUGHED
HE FOUND OLD MR BERTRAM SITTING IN AN EASY CHAIR ON THE SLOPE BESIDE THE CASTLE WITH HIS FEET WRAPPED IN BLANKETS AND BESIDE HIM HIS DAUGHTER AND THE DOMINIE AND A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHOM HE DID NOT RECOGNISE BUT WHO HE AFTERWARDS LEARNED WAS A GENTLEMAN CALLED CHARLES HAZLEWOOD WHO WAS DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH MISS BERTRAM
I PURSUED IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME TILL AT LAST I PERCEIVED A LIGHT RESEMBLING A STAR
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN NOW I SEE THAT PATIENCE HAS THE BEST WISDOM AND THAT UPON MANY ACCOUNTS
MY INTENTION WAS TO REACH IF POSSIBLE ONE OF THOSE ISLANDS WHICH I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE LAY ON THE NORTHEAST OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND
AT THE END OF THE LANE THERE WAS A POST-CHAISE AND HORSES WAITING
WHICH BY KEEPING OFF AT SEA TO AVOID THE INDRAFT OF THE BAY OR GULF OF MEXICO WE MIGHT EASILY PERFORM AS WE HOPED IN ABOUT FIFTEEN DAYS SAIL
FOR I WAS WET HAD NO CLOTHES TO SHIFT ME NOR ANYTHING EITHER TO EAT OR DRINK TO COMFORT ME
COGIA HOUSSAIN RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT BY ASSURING ALI BABA THAT THOUGH HIS SON MIGHT NOT HAVE ACQUIRED THE EXPERIENCE OF OLDER MEN HE HAD GOOD SENSE EQUAL TO THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY OTHERS
HOWEVER WE HAD NO REMEDY BUT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE ISSUE OF THINGS MIGHT PRESENT
BUT THE MONEY HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE ROBBERS HE CONVEYED THITHER BY NIGHT
IN A WORD I BROUGHT AWAY ALL THE SAILS FIRST AND LAST
THE KING WHEN HE DISMISSED ME MADE ME A VERY CONSIDERABLE PRESENT
AND THEY BEING HEEDLESS DID BOTH FALL SUDDENLY INTO THE BOG
THEN SAID THE INTERPRETER TO CHRISTIAN HAST THOU CONSIDERED ALL THESE THINGS
THE ATTACKING PARTY THEN DREW THEIR SWORDS AND ASSAILED HIM ON EVERY SIDE
THEY WERE ALL IN FLAMING FIRE ALSO THE HEAVENS WERE IN A BURNING FLAME
HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAVE HE ALIGHTED TIED HIS HORSE TO A TREE THEN APPROACHING THE ENTRANCE AND PRONOUNCING THE WORDS OPEN SESAME THE DOOR OPENED
I DURST NOT PRESUME TO CALL
BUT NEITHER WOULD THIS DELIVER ME FROM THE FURY OF THE SEA WHICH CAME POURING IN AFTER ME AGAIN
BUT I MUST CORRECT YOUR ERROR CONCERNING MYSELF
BUT I FOUND ALL MY LABOR TO LITTLE PURPOSE
FINDS THE PRINT OF A MAN'S FOOT ON THE SAND BY DANIEL DEFOE IT WOULD HAVE MADE A STOIC SMILE TO HAVE SEEN ME AND MY LITTLE FAMILY SIT DOWN TO DINNER
TO ME THEY ARE VALUELESS
AND THAT WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY AFFLICTING TO ME WAS THAT I HAD NO WEAPON EITHER TO HUNT AND KILL ANY CREATURE FOR MY SUSTENANCE OR TO DEFEND MYSELF AGAINST ANY OTHER CREATURE THAT MIGHT DESIRE TO KILL ME FOR THEIRS
THEN SAID CHRISTIAN TO THE INTERPRETER EXPOUND THIS MATTER MORE FULLY TO ME
WHAT DOEST THOU HERE CHRISTIAN
HERE IS A LETTER AND IF I MISTAKE NOT IT IS IN SAXON THE TEMPLAR TOOK THE PAPER FROM HIS HAND AND READ IT
AND SHORTLY AFTER HIS APPOINTMENT HE BEGAN LITTLE BY LITTLE TO BECOME VERY UNPOPULAR WITH THE GIPSIES WITH WHOM HE HAD BEFORE BEEN SUCH A FAVOURITE
ALONSO WHO SEEMED SORRIEST OF THEM ALL FOR HIS PAST CRIMES LAMENTED THE LOSS OF HIS HEIR
OR IF I PLEASED I MIGHT CALL MYSELF KING OR EMPEROR OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHICH I HAD POSSESSION OF
BUT THE HOPE OF FURNISHING MYSELF WITH NECESSARIES ENCOURAGED ME TO GO BEYOND WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE DONE UPON ANOTHER OCCASION
THOU THOU THE DAUGHTER OF MY FATHER'S FRIEND AND COMPANION IN ARMS THY FATHER'S FRIEND ECHOED URFRIED
SO I PULLED OFF MY CLOTHES--FOR THE WEATHER WAS HOT TO EXTREMITY--AND TOOK THE WATER
FOR WAITING THEREABOUTS TILL EVENING I WENT UP TO THE ROCK AGAIN AND THEN THE TIDE OF EBB BEING MADE I PLAINLY SAW THE CURRENT AGAIN AS BEFORE ONLY THAT IT RAN FARTHER OFF BEING NEAR HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE SHORE WHEREAS IN MY CASE IT SET CLOSE UPON THE SHORE AND HURRIED ME AND MY CANOE ALONG WITH IT WHICH AT ANOTHER TIME IT WOULD NOT HAVE DONE
BUT AS I HAD BOTH SCISSORS AND RAZORS SUFFICIENT I HAD CUT IT PRETTY SHORT EXCEPT WHAT GREW ON MY UPPER LIP WHICH I HAD TRIMMED INTO A LARGE PAIR OF MAHOMETAN WHISKERS SUCH AS I HAD SEEN WORN BY SOME TURKS AT SALLEE FOR THE MOORS DID NOT WEAR SUCH THOUGH THE TURKS DID
ON A PLATFORM BEYOND THE SOUTHERN ENTRANCE WERE PITCHED FIVE MAGNIFICENT PAVILIONS ADORNED WITH PENNONS OF RUSSET AND BLACK THE CHOSEN COLOURS OF THE FIVE KNIGHTS CHALLENGERS
HATE THEREFORE HIS TURNING THEE OUT OF THE WAY AND ABHOR THYSELF FOR HEARKENING TO HIM
I SAY BESIDES FOR I SAW IT THAT KING RICHARD HIMSELF AND FIVE OF HIS KNIGHTS HELD A TOURNAMENT AFTER THE TAKING OF ST JOHN-DE ACRE AS CHALLENGERS AND PROVED THEMSELVES SUPERIOR TO ALL COMERS THE SWARTHY COUNTENANCE OF THE TEMPLAR GREW DARKER WITH A BITTER SCOWL OF RAGE AS HE LISTENED TO THESE WORDS
THE OTHER PRISONERS HAD BETTER USAGE
AND I WAS NOT WITHOUT SECRET WISHES THAT I WERE ON SHORE THERE FANCYING THAT SEEING THE MAINLAND AND AN INHABITED COUNTRY I MIGHT FIND SOME WAY OR OTHER TO CONVEY MYSELF FURTHER AND PERHAPS AT LAST FIND SOME MEANS OF ESCAPE
AT THAT SUMMONS THE GENIE APPEARED AND SAID WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THE JOY OF BOTH AT SEEING EACH OTHER AFTER SO CRUEL A SEPARATION
I COULD FORCE NOTHING ON HIM BUT A FOOTMAN'S TOOTH WHICH I OBSERVED HIM TO EXAMINE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND FOUND HE HAD A FANCY FOR IT
HE WAS ACCORDINGLY USHERED INTO A SMALL ILL-FURNISHED APARTMENT THROUGH THE BARRED WINDOWS OF WHICH HE COULD GET A GLIMPSE OF THE SEA WHICH WAS DASHING SULLENLY AGAINST THE OUTER WALLS
BROTHER BE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE US
BUT THAT WHICH ASTONISHED HIM MOST WAS TO KNOW HOW I KILLED THE OTHER INDIAN SO FAR OFF
AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE THE OLD WOMAN ADDRESSED THE JEWESS TELLING HER THAT SHE WAS ONCE AS YOUNG AND FAIR AS HERSELF WHEN FRONT-DE-BOEUF THE FATHER OF THE MAN WHO NOW LORDED IT IN THE CASTLE ATTACKED THE PLACE AND SLEW HER FATHER AND HIS SEVEN SONS AND SHE BECAME THE PREY AND SCORN OF THE CONQUEROR
AND NOW WALDEMAR FITZURSE SAY ME THE TRUTH
AFTER THEY WERE ALL ENTERED AND HAD FORMED A SEMI-CIRCLE BEFORE THE SULTAN'S THRONE THE BLACK SLAVES LAID THE GOLDEN TRAYS ON THE CARPET PROSTRATED THEMSELVES TOUCHING THE CARPET WITH THEIR FOREHEADS AND AT THE SAME TIME THE WHITE SLAVES DID THE SAME
NOW THIS ISLAND WAS ENCHANTED AND FOR YEARS HAD LAIN UNDER THE SPELL OF A FELL WITCH SYCORAX WHO HAD IMPRISONED IN THE TRUNKS OF TREES ALL THE GOOD SPIRITS SHE FOUND THERE
THEREFORE TO THIS END HE SENT HIM HARNESS'D OUT
THE COMBAT ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE TOURNAMENT WAS ON A MUCH MORE EXTENDED SCALE THAN THAT OF THE PREVIOUS ONE
THAT'S NOT FOR NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH IS I CAN EAT NO VICTUALS THAT HAVE ANY SALT IN THEM
TO THIS END WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED WHAT SHE HAD TO DO IN THE KITCHEN SHE HELPED ABDALLA TO CARRY UP THE DISHES
AND THIS I DID OUT OF THE SHORT PIECES OF BOARDS THAT I BROUGHT ON MY RAFT FROM THE SHIP
HE WAS NOT LONG IN DETERMINING HOW HE SHOULD PAY THE LAST DUES TO HIS BROTHER
ON HIS RETURN HE HAD RECOURSE TO AN OPERATION OF GEOMANCY TO FIND OUT WHERE THE LAMP WAS--WHETHER ALADDIN CARRIED IT ABOUT WITH HIM OR WHERE HE LEFT IT
SO AWAY HE WENT AND CHRISTIAN SAW HIM NO MORE
THE PICTURE OF THE BRAVE CAPTAIN IN HIS HAIRY GOATSKIN CLOTHES POLL ON HIS SHOULDER HIS FAITHFUL DOG BY HIS SIDE AND FRIDAY FOLLOWING ALONG BEHIND IS ONE THAT REMAINS STAMPED FOR LIFE ON EVERY READER'S MIND
EIGHTY POLES EACH OF ONE FOOT HIGH WERE ERECTED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND VERY STRONG CORDS OF THE BIGNESS OF PACKTHREAD WERE FASTENED BY HOOKS TO MANY BANDAGES WHICH THE WORKMEN HAD GIRT ROUND MY NECK MY HANDS MY BODY AND MY LEGS
WHENCE CAME YOU GOOD WOMAN SAID HE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE GRAND VIZIER'S SON IS TO MARRY THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR THE SULTAN'S DAUGHTER TO-NIGHT
THIS WAS EXEMPLIFIED IN ME AT THIS TIME IN THE MOST LIVELY MANNER IMAGINABLE
THIS I BEGAN AND IT COST ME A PRODIGIOUS DEAL OF PAINS BUT WHO GRUDGE PAINS WHO HAVE THEIR DELIVERANCE IN VIEW
I GOT IT CLEANED AND PUT IT INTO MY CABINET
THEN CHRISTIAN ASKED WHAT IS THE REASON OF THE DISCONTENT OF PASSION
REMOVE THE BRIDEGROOM SAID ALADDIN TO THE GENIE AND KEEP HIM A PRISONER TILL TO-MORROW DAWN AND THEN RETURN WITH HIM HERE ON ALADDIN BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE PRINCESS HE ENDEAVORED TO ASSUAGE HER FEARS AND EXPLAINED TO HER THE TREACHERY PRACTISED UPON HIM BY THE SULTAN HER FATHER
ALL THESE I SECURED TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL THINGS BELONGING TO THE GUNNER PARTICULARLY TWO OR THREE IRON CROWS AND TWO BARRELS OF MUSKET BULLETS SEVEN MUSKETS ANOTHER FOWLING-PIECE WITH SOME SMALL QUANTITY OF POWDER MORE
SO WE WORKED AT THE OAR TOWARD THE LAND THOUGH WITH HEAVY HEARTS LIKE MEN GOING TO EXECUTION
IF THEY DESIRED THAT AS I HAD LIBERTY TO LEAVE THE ISLAND I HAD SOME INCLINATION TO GIVE THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD SHIFT ON SHORE
BUT I HAVE A LITTLE COTTON WHICH I HAVE SPUN
IT IS TRUE HE WENT AWKWARDLY IN THESE CLOTHES AT FIRST
FOR ALTHOUGH MY PROPER EMPLOYMENT HAD BEEN TO BE SURGEON OR DOCTOR TO THE SHIP YET OFTEN UPON A PINCH I WAS FORCED TO WORK LIKE A COMMON MARINER
THERE IS ALSO A PEARL-FISHERY IN THE MOUTH OF ITS PRINCIPAL RIVER
AND HAVING CUT ME A SHORT STICK LIKE A TRUNCHEON FOR MY DEFENCE I TOOK UP MY LODGING
AND IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS TIME I HAD A WOOD BEFORE MY DWELLING GROWING SO MONSTROUSLY THICK AND STRONG THAT IT WAS INDEED PERFECTLY IMPASSABLE
I AM GLAD I HAVE WITH ME A MERCIFUL BROTHER
NESBIT AS YOU LIKE IT E
BUT I SOON FOUND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT
THE MOTHER AND SON SAT AT BREAKFAST TILL IT WAS DINNER TIME AND THEN THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST TO PUT THE TWO MEALS TOGETHER
THEY LISTENED VERY ATTENTIVELY TO MY DISCOURSES ON THESE HEADS BUT ESPECIALLY TO THAT PART WHICH RELATED TO THE BUYING OF NEGROES WHICH WAS A TRADE AT THAT TIME NOT FAR ENTERED INTO
BUT BECAUSE THE READER MAY BE CURIOUS TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE STYLE AND MANNER OF EXPRESSION PECULIAR TO THAT PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO KNOW THE ARTICLES UPON WHICH I RECOVERED MY LIBERTY I HAVE MADE A TRANSLATION OF THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT WORD FOR WORD AS NEAR AS I WAS ABLE WHICH I HERE OFFER TO THE PUBLIC
AS HE OFFERED TO ADVANCE SHE EXCLAIMED REMAIN WHERE THOU ART PROUD TEMPLAR OR AT THY CHOICE ADVANCE
WHICH I SUPPOSE MUST BE IMPUTED TO THE GREAT HEIGHT THEY WERE AT
WHEN ALI BABA GOT HOME HE DROVE HIS ASSES INTO A LITTLE YARD SHUT THE GATES VERY CAREFULLY THREW OFF THE WOOD THAT COVERED THE PANNIERS CARRIED THE BAGS INTO THE HOUSE AND RANGED THEM IN ORDER BEFORE HIS WIFE
AS I SAT QUIETLY MEDITATING AT MY TABLE I HEARD SOMETHING BOUNCE IN AT THE CLOSET-WINDOW AND SKIP ABOUT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
TARRY TILL I SHALL SHEW THEE ONE THING MORE AND THEN THOU SHALT GO THY WAY
BUT GOOD BROTHER LET ME GO BEFORE
THE INTERPRETER THEN BID HIM TELL TO CHRISTIAN THE REASON OF HIS SO DOING
ON THE VERY DAY THAT THE THREE MONTHS CONTAINED IN THE SULTAN'S PROMISE EXPIRED THE MOTHER OF ALADDIN AGAIN WENT TO THE PALACE AND STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE IN THE DIVAN
BY THE WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THAT CHRISTIAN COULD DO TO AVOID IT APOLLYON WOUNDED HIM IN HIS HEAD HIS HAND AND FOOT THIS MADE CHRISTIAN GIVE A LITTLE BACK
IT SHALL BE A TEST FOR ALL WE MEET DURING OUR PROGRESS TOWARD A RIPENED JUDGMENT AND SO LONG AS OUR TASTE IS UNSPOILED WE SHALL ENJOY READING IT
DURING THIS STORM WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A STRONG WIND WEST SOUTHWEST WE WERE CARRIED BY MY COMPUTATION ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES TO THE EAST SO THAT THE OLDEST SAILOR ON BOARD COULD NOT TELL IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD WE WERE
THE NEXT DAY DAWNED IN UNCLOUDED SPLENDOUR AND AT TEN O'CLOCK THE WHOLE PLAIN WAS CROWDED WITH HORSEMEN HORSEWOMEN AND FOOT PASSENGERS HASTENING TO THE TOURNAMENT
IN THE MEANTIME I FELT AT LEAST FORTY MORE OF THE SAME KIND AS I CONJECTURED FOLLOWING THE FIRST
IN HIS WILD DISMAY AND TERROR FOR HIS CHILD AND REMEMBERING THE WORDS OF MEG MERRILIES THE LAIRD HURRIED AWAY TO DERNCLEUGH HOPING TO GET SOME NEWS OF HIM FROM ANY OF THE GIPSIES WHO MIGHT STILL BE LINGERING ROUND THE PLACE
WHO AFTER THE FIRST TIME DURST NOT OFFER HIM LESS FOR FEAR OF LOSING SO GOOD A BARGAIN
THE VANQUISHED OF WHOM VERY FEW REMAINED SCATTERED AND ESCAPED INTO THE NEIGHBOURING WOOD
AND BEHIND HIM THERE IS ANOTHER WHO STANDS WITH A ROD OF GOLD ON THE TOP OF WHICH IS AN EMERALD HALF A FOOT LONG AND AN INCH THICK
HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND BLACK NOT CURLED LIKE WOOL
SHE LAY ALMOST WHERE SHE DID AT FIRST BUT NOT QUITE
THE BREECHES WERE MADE OF THE SKIN OF AN OLD HE-GOAT WHOSE HAIR HUNG DOWN SUCH A LENGTH ON EITHER SIDE THAT LIKE PANTALOONS IT REACHED TO THE MIDDLE OF MY LEGS
OPEN THE CARRIAGE THEN
AND AS SHE FINISHED MANNERING HEARD HER MURMUR SOMETHING ABOUT THE THREAD OF LIFE BEING THREE TIMES BROKEN AND THREE TIMES MENDED AND DISTINCTLY HEARD HER SAY
PILGRIM SAID THE LADY AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE DURING WHICH SHE SEEMED UNCERTAIN HOW TO ADDRESS HIM YOU THIS NIGHT MENTIONED A NAME--I MEAN THE NAME OF IVANHOE--I WOULD GLADLY HEAR NEWS OF HIM
GURTH THE SWINEHERD A SERVANT OF MUCH IMPORTANCE AT THAT TIME WHEN APPEALED TO OPEN THE GATE REFUSED TO LET THE VISITORS OUT AT SUCH AN UNSEASONABLE HOUR
WHEREAT MANY OF THE RABBLE BELOW COULD NOT FORBEAR LAUGHING
ONE DAY WHEN ALI BABA WAS IN THE FOREST AND HAD JUST CUT WOOD ENOUGH TO LOAD HIS ASSES HE SAW AT A DISTANCE A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST WHICH SEEMED TO APPROACH HIM
BEGINNING AT THE FIRST JAR AND SO ON TO THE LAST HE SAID TO EACH MAN
CLOSE BESIDE IT WAS THE OLD CASTLE OF ELLANGOWAN
AND SOME SOUGHT TO HIDE THEMSELVES UNDER THE MOUNTAINS
THOU BEAREST AN ENGLISH HEART AND MUST NEEDS OBEY ME
WHEN THE PRISONER WAS INTRODUCED TO THE MAGISTRATE'S ROOM GLOSSIN AT ONCE RECOGNISED THAT IT WAS DIRCK HATTERAICK THE SMUGGLER CAPTAIN
SHE HOWEVER REFUSED ALL OFFERS OF ASSISTANCE AND CALLED FOR HARRY BERTRAM
UPON MATURELY CONSIDERING THIS THEREFORE I RESOLVED TO DRAW ME A SECOND FORTIFICATION
WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY BREATH HE THRUST ONE OF HIS FEET AGAINST MY SIDE AND STRUCK ME SO RUDELY WITH THE OTHER THAT HE FORCED ME TO RISE UP AGAINST MY WILL
WHEREUPON THEY STOLE OFF UNPERCEIVED AND IT WAS THREE WEEKS BEFORE I KNEW THE CAUSE OF MY AWAKING SO SUDDENLY
AND A GREAT WATCH-COAT TO COVER ME
FOLLOW ME AS I CREEP IN SHE SAID
BESIDES THESE BRING MY MOTHER SIX WOMEN SLAVES TO ATTEND HER AS RICHLY DRESSED AT LEAST AS ANY OF THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR'S EACH CARRYING A COMPLETE DRESS FIT FOR ANY SULTANESS
GULLIVER ESCAPES FROM THE EAGLE BY JONATHAN SWIFT PERILOUS CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WHICH I HAD ALREADY ESCAPED INSPIRED ME WITH A STRONG IMPULSE THAT I SHOULD SOME TIME RECOVER MY LIBERTY THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONJECTURE BY WHAT MEANS OR TO FORM ANY PROJECT WITH THE LEAST HOPE OF SUCCEEDING
HE SAID HE COULD DISCOVER GREAT HOLES IN MY SKIN
GENIE SAID ALADDIN BUILD ME A PALACE FIT TO RECEIVE THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR
SINCE WE MUST HAVE BOOKS THERE IS ONE WHICH TO MY MIND FURNISHES THE FINEST TREATISE ON EDUCATION ACCORDING TO NATURE
SIX LARGE WHITE BREAD CAKES ON TWO PLATES TWO FLAGONS OF WINE AND TWO SILVER CUPS
WHEN DAY DAWNED THE OUTLAWS AND THEIR RESCUED PRISONERS ASSEMBLED AROUND THE TRYSTING-TREE IN THE OAK FOREST BESIDE THE NOW RUINED CASTLE
WITH THE FRUIT OF THESE TREES THEY WERE ALSO MUCH DELIGHTED
NO SAID HE I SHALL NOT DO THAT
THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE
WHILE HIS SON WAS STILL ARGUING WITH HIM THE SHERIFF OF THE COUNTRY CAME IN HURRIEDLY AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD HAD INFORMATION THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE TROOPS FROM THE CUSTOM HOUSE WAS ONLY PART OF A PLAN AND THAT THEY SHOULD AT ONCE RETURN
ALIVE SAIDST THOU
AND IN NO LONGTIME AFTER THE TWO OCCUPANTS OF THE WRETCHED APARTMENT WERE FAST ASLEEP
AND I SOON FOUND MY COMFORTS ABATE AND THAT IN A WORD I HAD A DREADFUL DELIVERANCE
MY SON TAKE IT OUT OF MY SIGHT AND PUT IT WHERE YOU PLEASE
GOOD BROTHER PLUCK IT OUT OF THY BOSOM AND TRY
AT LAST THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND AS THE CAPTAIN WENT IN LAST SO HE CAME OUT FIRST AND STOOD TO SEE THEM ALL PASS BY HIM
AND OUGHT I NOT TO BESTOW HER ON ONE WHO VALUES HER AT SO GREAT A PRICE I CANNOT BUT OWN REPLIED THE GRAND VIZIER THAT THE PRESENT IS WORTHY OF THE PRINCESS
THE NURSE TO QUIET HER BABE MADE USE OF A RATTLE WHICH WAS A KIND OF HOLLOW VESSEL FILLED WITH GREAT STONES AND FASTENED BY A CABLE TO THE CHILD'S WAIST
WITH HIS DAUGHTER WE WILL DEAL AS THE CHRISTIAN LAW AND OUR OWN HIGH OFFICE WARRANT POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
FOR WITHOUT THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME AGAIN
HIS FACE WAS ROUND AND PLUMP
FOR I HAD FOUND A PRODIGIOUS VESSEL ON THE SHORE ABLE TO CARRY ME ON THE SEA WHICH HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO FIT UP WITH MY OWN ASSISTANCE AND DIRECTION
THESE CONSIDERATIONS MOVED ME TO HASTEN MY DEPARTURE SOMEWHAT SOONER THAN I INTENDED
I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN PLAINER BUT THAT YOU ARE OLDER THAN I
RIDE YOUR WAYS LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN
HE TOLD THE MAGICIAN HE HAD A GREATER INCLINATION TO THAT BUSINESS THAN TO ANY OTHER AND THAT HE SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS KINDNESS
THE MAGICIAN APPOINTED HIS TIME AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE CARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE HANDSOME AND WELL POLISHED
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL ALI BABA REMOVED HIS FEW GOODS OPENLY TO HIS SISTER-IN LAW'S HOUSE IN WHICH IT WAS AGREED THAT HE SHOULD IN FUTURE LIVE
BUT LITTLE HE ANSWERED
BUT WHEN HE TALKED OF ASKING THE PRINCESS IN MARRIAGE SHE LAUGHED ALOUD
I SLEPT ABOUT TWO HOURS AND DREAMED I WAS AT HOME WITH MY WIFE AND CHILDREN WHICH AGGRAVATED MY SORROWS WHEN I AWAKED AND FOUND MYSELF ALONE IN A VAST ROOM BETWEEN TWO AND THREE HUNDRED FEET WIDE AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HIGH LYING IN A BED TWENTY YARDS WIDE
ONE OF THEM ANSWERED IN THE NAME OF THE REST THAT THEY HAD NOTHING TO SAY BUT THIS THAT WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN THE CAPTAIN PROMISED THEM THEIR LIVES AND THEY HUMBLY IMPLORED MY MERCY
AND THEN I WENT TO TAKE HER UP WITH ONE HAND BY THE WAIST
A BOOK THAT EXERTS A DEEP AS WELL AS A WIDE INFLUENCE MUST PRODUCE CHANGES IN THE READER'S WAY OF THINKING AND EXCITE HIM TO ACTIVITY
THE DISHES WERE OF MASSY GOLD AND CONTAINED THE MOST DELICATE VIANDS
ALADDIN HAD NOT LONG CONCEALED HIMSELF BEFORE THE PRINCESS CAME
AND HAVING BY THE AMUSEMENT OF MY MIND BEEN AS IT WERE TIRED AND MY SPIRITS EXHAUSTED I SLEPT VERY SOUNDLY AND WAKED MUCH BETTER COMPOSED THAN I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
IMMEDIATELY A GENIE OF FRIGHTFUL ASPECT APPEARED AND SAID WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE
IN A WORD I TOLD THEM I WOULD GO WITH ALL MY HEART IF THEY WOULD UNDERTAKE TO LOOK AFTER MY PLANTATION IN MY ABSENCE AND WOULD DISPOSE OF IT TO SUCH AS I SHOULD DIRECT IF I MISCARRIED
THAT NOTHING COULD NOW PASS WHICH WAS NOT EXTRAORDINARY
THE BANISHED DUKE'S DAUGHTER ROSALIND REMAINED WITH CELIA FREDERICK'S DAUGHTER AND THE TWO LOVED EACH OTHER MORE THAN MOST SISTERS
BUT I HAD SCARCELY SHUT MY EYES WHEN SOMETHING THAT FELL BY ME WITH A GREAT NOISE AWAKED ME
SEVERAL CAUSES WERE CALLED ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDER PLEADED AND ADJUDGED UNTIL THE TIME THE DIVAN GENERALLY BROKE UP WHEN THE SULTAN RISING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENT ATTENDED BY THE GRAND VIZIER
AND THEN I MADE HIM A JERKIN OF GOAT'S SKIN AS WELL AS MY SKILL WOULD ALLOW FOR I WAS NOW GROWN A TOLERABLY GOOD TAILOR
IN HIS PERPLEXITY HE ORDERED THE GRAND VIZIER TO BE SENT FOR WITH EXPEDITION
I WENT ON IN FRONT TO START SOMETHING AND I SOON SAW MY DOG STOP BEFORE SEVERAL HUNDRED COVEYS OF PARTRIDGES
I ONCE WAS AS I THOUGHT FAIR FOR THE COELESTIAL CITY AND HAD THEN EVEN JOY AT THE THOUGHTS THAT I SHOULD GET THITHER
HE STARTED UP AND STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS IN ORDER TO SACRIFICE I SOME OF US TO HIS RAGE
SOON AFTER I HEARD A GENERAL SHOUT WITH FREQUENT REPETITIONS OF THE WORDS PEPLOM SELAN AND I FELT GREAT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ON MY LEFT SIDE RELAXING THE CORDS TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT I WAS ABLE TO TURN UPON MY RIGHT
I GUESSED HIS MEANING AND MY GOOD FORTUNE GAVE ME SO MUCH PRESENCE OF MIND THAT I RESOLVED NOT TO STRUGGLE IN THE LEAST AS HE HELD ME IN THE AIR ABOVE SIXTY FEET FROM THE GROUND ALTHOUGH HE GRIEVOUSLY PINCHED MY SIDES FOR FEAR I SHOULD SLIP THROUGH HIS FINGERS
HERE I SAT FOR SOME TIME FIVE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE GROUND EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE BLOWN DOWN BY THE WIND OR TO FALL BY MY OWN GIDDINESS AND COME TUMBLING OVER AND OVER FROM THE RIDGE TO THE EAVES
CAPTION DISGUISED AS A TRAVELLER AND A STRANGER PAGE 27 FROM THE PAINTING BY EDMUND DULAC ALADDIN'S MOTHER TOOK THE CHINA DISH IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT THE JEWELS THE DAY BEFORE WRAPPED IT IN TWO FINE NAPKINS AND SET FORWARD FOR THE SULTAN'S PALACE
ALL THE PRECIOUS STONES THE JEWELLERS HAVE IN BAGDAD ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED TO MINE FOR SIZE OR BEAUTY
BUT HE WAS QUICKLY AS MUCH FRIGHTENED THE OTHER WAY
ABDALLA SEEING HER VERY UNEASY SAID DO NOT FRET AND TEASE YOURSELF BUT GO INTO THE YARD AND TAKE SOME OIL OUT OF ONE OF THE JARS MORGIANA THANKED ABDALLA FOR HIS ADVICE TOOK THE OIL-POT AND WENT INTO THE YARD
BROWN OBEYED WITH ALACRITY FEELING THAT HE WAS ALREADY OUT OF REACH OF DANGER WHEN THE VILLAINS HAD GONE OUT
THEY BOUGHT THESE AND SETTLED DOWN AS SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS IN THE FOREST
AFTER TRAVERSING SEVERAL STREETS HE CAME TO THAT PART OF THE TOWN WHERE THE MERCHANTS AND ARTISANS HAD THEIR PARTICULAR STREETS ACCORDING TO THEIR TRADES
MORGIANA A SLAVE TO THE DECEASED FOLLOWED IN THE PROCESSION WEEPING BEATING HER BREAST AND TEARING HER HAIR
HE STATED THAT GLOSSIN WAS PRESENT AND ACCEPTED A BRIBE TO KEEP THE MATTER A SECRET
AND I HAD ORDERED A HAMMOCK TO BE FIXED BY SILKEN ROPES FROM THE FOUR CORNERS AT THE TOP TO BREAK THE JOLTS WHEN A SERVANT CARRIED ME BEFORE HIM ON HORSEBACK AS I SOMETIMES DESIRED
AND A GREAT NUMBER MORE COMING BEFORE HIM AT A QUICK PACE
A SET OF GALLANTS HE SAID WHO HAVE BEEN MASQUERADING IN SUCH GUISE AS OUR OWN ARE CARRYING A BAND OF PRISONERS TO TORQUILSTONE THE CASTLE OF FRONT-DE-BOEUF
AND THE JEWESS WAS COMMANDED TO FIND A CHAMPION BY THE THIRD DAY FOLLOWING
THIS WAS COMMITTED TO FRIDAY AND THE TWO OTHER MEN WHO CAME ON SHORE WITH THE CAPTAIN
SO I WAS THEN OBLIGED TO SHOOT AT HIM FIRST WHICH I DID AND KILLED HIM AT THE FIRST SHOT
YOU MUST OVERHANG THE NIGHT WITH DROOPING FOG AND LEAD THEM SO ASTRAY THAT ONE WILL NEVER FIND THE OTHER
THEN HE WENT TO THE STILE TO SEE AND BEHOLD A PATH LAY ALONG BY THE WAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE
RASPE CROSSING THE THAMES WITHOUT THE AID OF BRIDGE BOAT OR BALLOON R
THEY CONVEYED THEMSELVES INTO THE TOWN WITH THE SAME PRECAUTION AS BEFORE
THEY DRESSED THE CORPSE OF THE WOMAN IN HER RICHEST APPAREL AND ALL HER JEWELS AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER WEDDING DAY
THIS DIVERSION IS ONLY PRACTISED BY THOSE PERSONS WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR GREAT EMPLOYMENTS AND HIGH FAVOR AT COURT
HE WENT TO A COPPERSMITH AND ASKED FOR A DOZEN COPPER LAMPS
THAT THE WEATHER BEING CALM HE ROWED ROUND ME SEVERAL TIMES OBSERVED MY WINDOWS AND WIRE LATTICES THAT DEFENDED THEM
IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONG AND FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER
I TOOK WITH ME SIX COWS AND TWO BULLS ALIVE WITH AS MANY EWES AND RAMS INTENDING TO CARRY THEM INTO MY OWN COUNTRY AND PROPAGATE THE BREED
HE WENT TO THE FOREST AND WHEN HE CAME NEAR THE ROCK HAVING SEEN NEITHER HIS BROTHER NOR THE MULES IN HIS WAY WAS SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT FINDING SOME BLOOD SPILLED NEAR THE DOOR WHICH HE TOOK FOR AN ILL OMEN
7TH
THESE WERE THE SUBJECTS OF THE FIRST NIGHT'S COGITATIONS AFTER I WAS COME HOME AGAIN WHILE THE APPREHENSIONS WHICH HAD SO OVERRUN MY MIND WERE FRESH UPON ME AND MY HEAD WAS FULL OF VAPORS
GOD HAS DELIVERED YOU FROM THEIR FURY AND HAS BESTOWED THAT FAVOR UPON YOU ONLY
THEY BROUGHT ME A SECOND HOGSHEAD WHICH I DRANK IN THE SAME MANNER AND MADE SIGNS FOR MORE
AND WITH THAT HE THREW A FLAMING DART AT HIS BREAST BUT CHRISTIAN HAD A SHIELD IN HIS HAND WITH WHICH HE CAUGHT IT AND SO PREVENTED THE DANGER OF THAT
THE FELLOW ON SHORE WAS BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING AND GOING TO START UP
THE PRINCESS WAS A NOTED BEAUTY
YOU MUST CARRY MY ANSWER AND PRESENT TO THE KING OF SERENDIB THIS COMMAND OF THE CALIPH WAS TO ME LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER
AND AT LAST THE BOYS AND GIRLS WOULD VENTURE TO COME AND PLAY AT HIDE-AND-SEEK IN MY HAIR
HOWEVER UPON WAKING I FOUND MYSELF MUCH RECOVERED
BUT HIS THOUGHTS WERE SO FULL OF THE GREAT RICHES HE SHOULD POSSESS THAT HE COULD NOT THINK OF THE NECESSARY WORD TO MAKE IT OPEN AND INSTEAD OF SESAME SAID OPEN BARLEY AND WAS MUCH AMAZED TO FIND THAT THE DOOR REMAINED FAST SHUT
ON EXAMINING THE PLANETARY CRYSTAL HE FOUND THAT HIS BROTHER WAS NO LONGER LIVING BUT HAD BEEN POISONED
HIS SISTER LUCY FOUND A HUSBAND IN HER OLD LOVER CHARLES HAZLEWOOD AND THE DOMINIE WAS RAISED ONCE AGAIN TO A CONDITION OF ECSTATIC HAPPINESS SEEING HIS LITTLE HARRY"--AS HE STILL CONTINUED TO CALL HIM--NOW LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN AND HIMSELF LIBRARIAN IN THE HOUSE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO LONG A STRANGER
AND THAT IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO CONSENT TO IT I WOULD SET THEM AT LIBERTY AS I FOUND THEM AND IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT HE MIGHT TAKE THEM AGAIN IF HE COULD CATCH THEM
BUT THEY HAD NONE TO GIVE ME
BUT WHEN THE FIELD BECAME THIN BY THE NUMBERS ON EITHER SIDE WHO HAD YIELDED THEMSELVES VANQUISHED OR HAD BEEN RENDERED INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING THE STRIFE THE TEMPLAR AND THE UNKNOWN KNIGHT AT LENGTH ENCOUNTERED HAND TO HAND WITH ALL THE FURY THAT MORTAL ANIMOSITY JOINED TO RIVALRY OF HONOUR COULD INSPIRE
SHE WAS CERTAINLY LOST AND I NEVER HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN
BUT LUCKILY MY CREDIT IS GOOD IN VENICE AND I WILL BORROW FOR YOU WHAT YOU NEED THERE WAS LIVING IN VENICE AT THIS TIME A RICH MONEY-LENDER NAMED SHYLOCK
CUTTING THE GREAT CABLE INTO PIECES SUCH AS I COULD MOVE I GOT TWO CABLES AND A HAWSER ON SHORE WITH ALL THE IRONWORK I COULD GET
THINGS BEING THUS PREPARED WHEN THE NINETEEN MULES WERE LOADED WITH THIRTY-SEVEN ROBBERS IN JARS AND THE JAR OF OIL THE CAPTAIN AS THEIR DRIVER SET OUT WITH THEM AND REACHED THE TOWN BY THE DUSK OF THE EVENING AS HE HAD INTENDED
HE LOADED ME WITH HONORS AND RICH PRESENTS AND I HAVE EVER SINCE DEVOTED MYSELF TO MY FAMILY KINDRED AND FRIENDS
YET I FOUND I GAINED UPON HER FOR THE WIND SLACKENED
I KNEW THERE WERE THREE BARRELS OF POWDER IN THE SHIP BUT KNEW NOT WHERE OUR GUNNER HAD STOWED THEM
THE SULTAN KNEW HER AGAIN AND DIRECTED HIS VIZIER TO HAVE HER BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
THE GIPSIES WERE SUSPECTED AND MEG MERRILIES WAS ARRESTED
WONDER
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE READER THAT THERE WERE TWO STRONG STAPLES FIXED UPON THAT SIDE OF MY BOX WHICH HAD NO WINDOW
BUT BY THE NOISE I HEARD I KNEW THEIR NUMBERS INCREASED
BUT AT LAST SHE TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS SHE WHO IN THE DISGUISE OF THE LAWYER HAD SAVED HIS FRIEND'S LIFE AND GOT THE RING FROM HIM
AND IF YOU DO NOT YIELD YOU ARE ALL LOST WILL THEY GIVE US QUARTER THEN SAYS TOM SMITH AND WE WILL YIELD I'LL GO AND ASK IF YOU PROMISE TO YIELD SAID ROBINSON
AT THE END OF THE THIRD HALL YOU WILL FIND A DOOR WHICH OPENS INTO A GARDEN PLANTED WITH FINE TREES LOADED WITH FRUIT
DO YOU NOT KNOW IT
SO CHRISTIAN WENT ON WITH HASTE NEITHER SPAKE HE TO ANY MAN BY THE WAY
AT LENGTH HE VENTURED TO TAKE ME BEHIND BY THE MIDDLE BETWEEN HIS FOREFINGER AND THUMB AND BROUGHT ME WITHIN THREE YARDS OF HIS EYES THAT HE MIGHT BEHOLD MY SHAPE MORE PERFECTLY
I REMEMBER A THRUSH HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO SNATCH OUT OF MY HAND WITH HIS BILL A PIECE OF CAKE THAT GLUMDALCLITCH HAD JUST GIVEN ME FOR MY BREAKFAST
HE HAD HIRED A CHAISE AND HORSES BUT HAD NOT GONE FAR ON THE WILD ROAD TO KIPPLETRINGAN WHEN NIGHT CAME ON AND THE SNOW FELL HEAVILY
BUT THE CAPTAIN MR THOMAS WILCOCKS AN HONEST WORTHY SHROPSHIRE MAN OBSERVING I WAS READY TO FAINT TOOK ME INTO HIS CABIN GAVE ME A CORDIAL TO COMFORT ME AND MADE ME TURN IN UPON HIS OWN BED ADVISING ME TO TAKE A LITTLE REST OF WHICH I HAD GREAT NEED
HOW OFTEN DID I THEN WISH MYSELF WITH MY DEAR GLUMDALCLITCH FROM WHOM ONE SINGLE HOUR HAD SO FAR DIVIDED ME
THEY HAD ONCE BEEN PEOPLE OF WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ON THE SOUTH SIDE WHEREOF WAS A SMALL NECK OF LAND JUTTING OUT INTO THE SEA AND A CREEK TOO SHALLOW TO HOLD A SHIP OF ABOVE ONE HUNDRED TONS
I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT OUR PALACE WAS THE MOST SUPERB MAGNIFICENT AND COMPLETE IN THE WORLD
AFTER THREE YEARS EXPECTATION THAT THINGS WOULD MEND I ACCEPTED AN ADVANTAGEOUS OFFER FROM CAPTAIN WILLIAM PRICHARD MASTER OF THE ANTELOPE WHO WAS MAKING A VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH SEA
AND MY JOURNAL WOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF MANY DULL THINGS
HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS FOREHEAD WHERE IT BLAZED BRIGHT AS A BURNING COAL
HE THEN QUICKLY LEARNED ABOUT THE WEALTH CHARITIES HAPPINESS AND SPLENDID PALACE OF PRINCE ALADDIN
AND SO I WENT ON DESCRIBING THE REST OF HIS HOUSEHOLD STUFF AND PROVISIONS AFTER THE SAME MANNER
AND NOW SHE SAID YE MUST HAVE ARMS
IN A WORD THEY ALL LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS AND BEGGED THEIR LIVES
HEAR NOW WHAT I SHALL TELL YOU
WHEN IT WAS ENDED SINDBAD ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY SAID GENTLEMEN BE PLEASED TO LISTEN TO THE ADVENTURES OF MY SECOND VOYAGE
THE OTHER ASKED FOR A SMALL ONE
WE CANNOT ESCAPE IF HE DO NOT TAKE PITY ON US AT THESE WORDS HE ORDERED THE SAILS TO BE LOWERED
ON THAT WARM COUCH SHALT THOU LIE STRIPPED OF THY CLOTHES
I WAS SURGEON SUCCESSIVELY IN TWO SHIPS AND MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES FOR SIX YEARS TO THE EAST AND WEST INDIES BY WHICH I GOT SOME ADDITION TO MY FORTUNE
NOR WAS THERE ONE OF THE SIX THAT FOR HIS YEARS HAD MORE RENOWN IN ARMS
I FOUND NO EFFECT FROM ALL I COULD DO BUT PLAINLY PERCEIVED MY CLOSET TO BE MOVED ALONG
AND THIS YOU SAW CALLED HIMSELF THE SLAVE OF THE LAMP YOU HAD IN YOUR HAND
THAT SOME EAGLE HAD GOT THE CORD OF MY BOX IN HIS BEAK WITH AN INTENT TO LET IT FALL ON THE ROCK LIKE A TORTOISE IN A SHELL AND THEN PICK OUT MY BODY AND DEVOUR IT
KNOW THEN THAT UNDER THIS STONE THERE IS HIDDEN A TREASURE DESTINED TO BE YOURS AND WHICH WILL MAKE YOU RICHER THAN THE GREATEST MONARCH IN THE WORLD
AND MY FATHER NOW AND THEN SENDING ME SMALL SUMS OF MONEY I LAID THEM OUT IN LEARNING NAVIGATION AND OTHER PARTS OF THE MATHEMATICS USEFUL TO THOSE WHO INTEND TO TRAVEL AS I ALWAYS BELIEVED IT WOULD BE SOME TIME OR OTHER MY FORTUNE TO DO
CROSSING THE THAMES WITHOUT THE AID OF BRIDGE BOAT OR BALLOON BY R
THESE TRUMPETERS SALUTED CHRISTIAN AND HIS FELLOW WITH TEN THOUSAND WELCOMES FROM THE WORLD AND THIS THEY DID WITH SHOUTING AND SOUND OF TRUMPET
IF HE DID SO WITH THE REVERSE OF HIS LANCE THE TRIAL OF SKILL WAS MADE WITH WHAT WERE CALLED THE ARMS OF COURTESY THAT IS WITH LANCES AT WHOSE EXTREMITY A PIECE OF ROUND FLAT BOARD WAS FIXED SO THAT NO DANGER WAS ENCOUNTERED SAVE FROM THE SHOCK OF THE HORSES AND RIDERS
HE CALLED HIS HINDS ABOUT HIM AND ASKED THEM AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WHETHER THEY HAD EVER SEEN IN THE FIELDS ANY LITTLE CREATURE THAT RESEMBLED ME
BUT DID NONE OF THEM FOLLOW YOU TO PERSUADE YOU TO GO BACK
AND SO WHEN I FOUND I WAS PRETTY SAFE AS TO BEASTS OF PREY I WORKED SIDEWAYS TO THE RIGHT HAND INTO THE ROCK
IVANHOE CROSSED HIMSELF REPEATING PRAYERS IN SAXON LATIN AND NORMAN-FRENCH WHILE RICHARD ALTERNATELY SAID BENEDICITE AND SWORE MORT DE MA VIE IN THE NAME OF GOD SAID CEDRIC STARTING BACK IF THOU ART MORTAL SPEAK
TO THE SUMMONS OF THE HERALD WHO DEMANDED HIS RANK HIS NAME AND PURPOSE THE STRANGER ANSWERED RAISING HIS HELMET AS HE SPOKE I AM WILFRED OF IVANHOE I WILL NOT FIGHT WITH THEE AT PRESENT SAID BOIS-GUILBERT
HIS ELOQUENCE HAD MORE EFFECT THAN MINE FOR MY FATHER CONSENTED TO MY ACCOMPANYING HIM IN A VOYAGE TO THE ISLAND OF CEYLON WHERE HIS UNCLE HAD RESIDED AS GOVERNOR MANY YEARS
DE GRANTMESNIL SOON AFTER AVOWED HIMSELF VANQUISHED
BUT AS FOR ME AND MY MAN FRIDAY I DID NOT THINK IT WAS PROPER FOR US TO STIR HAVING SEVEN MEN LEFT BEHIND
IF I COULD FIND HIM I WOULD SOON CURE HIM OF HIS FOLLY ORLANDO CONFESSED THAT HE WAS THE FOOLISH LOVER AND ROSALIND SAID--"IF YOU WILL COME AND SEE ME EVERY DAY I WILL PRETEND TO BE ROSALIND AND I WILL TAKE HER PART AND BE WAYWARD AND CONTRARY AS IS THE WAY OF WOMEN TILL I MAKE YOU ASHAMED OF YOUR FOLLY IN LOVING HER AND SO EVERY DAY HE WENT TO HER HOUSE AND TOOK A PLEASURE IN SAYING TO HER ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO ROSALIND
ALL THE PEOPLE THE KING HIMSELF NOT EXCEPTED RODE THEIR HORSES WITHOUT BRIDLE OR STIRRUPS
BUT I NEEDED NONE OF ALL THIS PRECAUTION
BUT AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY AND AFTER THEIR SOLEMN PROMISES OF AMENDMENT THEY WERE TAKEN ON BOARD AND WERE SOME TIME AFTER SOUNDLY WHIPPED AND PICKLED
BUT HE CONSIDERED AGAIN THAT HE HAD NO ARMOUR FOR HIS BACK AND THEREFORE THOUGHT THAT TO TURN THE BACK TO HIM MIGHT GIVE HIM THE GREATER ADVANTAGE WITH EASE TO PIERCE HIM WITH HIS DARTS
HE GENTLY TOOK ME UP IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND ASKED ME HOW I DID
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT TWO OF THE WORLD'S WONDERFUL BOOKS ROBINSON CRUSOE AND GULLIVER'S TRAVELS APPEARED WHEN THEIR AUTHORS WERE SIXTY YEARS OF AGE AND WITHIN THREE YEARS OF EACH OTHER
AS IF HE THAT HAD FED ME BY MIRACLE HITHERTO COULD NOT PRESERVE BY HIS POWER THE PROVISION WHICH HE HAD MADE FOR ME BY HIS GOODNESS
FOR ONE OF THE PAGES HAVING PUT MY BOAT INTO THE TROUGH THE GOVERNESS WHO ATTENDED GLUMDALCLITCH VERY OFFICIOUSLY LIFTED ME UP TO PLACE ME IN THE BOAT
THE NEXT MORNING EARLY TWO OF THE FIVE MEN CAME SWIMMING TO THE SHIP'S SIDE AND MAKING THE MOST LAMENTABLE COMPLAINT OF THE OTHER THREE BEGGED TO BE TAKEN INTO THE SHIP FOR GOD'S SAKE FOR THEY SHOULD BE MURDERED AND BEGGED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE THEM ON BOARD THOUGH HE HANGED THEM IMMEDIATELY
GILES CLEMENT EUSTACE SEIZE THIS WITCH AND HURL HER FROM THE BATTLEMENTS
FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SLEPT LITTLE AND HAD LABORED VERY HARD ALL DAY TO FETCH ALL THOSE THINGS FROM THE SHIP AND TO GET THEM ON SHORE
I CANNOT GET OUT
BUT INSTEAD OF OBEYING HIM I REDOUBLED MY SPEED AND QUICKLY GOT OUT OF SIGHT
HE THEN LISTENED BUT NOT HEARING OR PERCEIVING ANYTHING WHEREBY HE COULD JUDGE THAT HIS COMPANIONS STIRRED HE BEGAN TO GROW VERY UNEASY THREW STONES A SECOND AND ALSO A THIRD TIME AND COULD NOT COMPREHEND THE REASON THAT NONE OF THEM SHOULD ANSWER HIS SIGNAL
AND WAMBA THE JESTER DISGUISED AS A MONK IS RESCUING CEDRIC DOES ANY BOY OR GIRL NEED TO KNOW MORE OF WHAT IVANHOE IS ABOUT
AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NONE BUT THE OLD MAN ABOUT THE HOUSES THE REST BEING ABROAD AND NOT TO RETURN TILL NIGHT WHICH WAS USUAL WITH THEM
MEANWHILE THERE WAS BRAVE FEASTING IN THE CASTLE OF YORK TO WHICH PRINCE JOHN HAD INVITED THOSE NOBLES PRELATES AND LEADERS BY WHOSE ASSISTANCE HE HOPED TO CARRY THROUGH HIS AMBITIOUS PROJECTS UPON HIS BROTHER'S THRONE
AS THE SULTAN WHO HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THEIR APPROACH HAD GIVEN ORDERS FOR THEM TO BE ADMITTED THEY MET WITH NO OBSTACLE BUT WENT INTO THE DIVAN IN REGULAR ORDER ONE PART TURNING TO THE RIGHT AND THE OTHER TO THE LEFT
PROSPERO KNOWING THEY WERE THERE RAISED BY HIS ART A GREAT STORM SO THAT EVEN THE SAILORS ON BOARD GAVE THEMSELVES UP FOR LOST
WHO COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS PATH SHOULD HAVE LED US OUT OF THE WAY
ALADDIN PUT THE MONEY INTO HIS HAND AND HASTENED TO THE PALACE WHICH HE ENTERED AT ONCE BY THE PRIVATE DOOR
THE LIVING HUSBAND IS INTERRED WITH THE DEAD WIFE AND THE LIVING WIFE WITH THE DEAD HUSBAND WHILE HE WAS GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF THIS BARBAROUS CUSTOM THE VERY RELATION OF WHICH CHILLED MY BLOOD HIS KINDRED FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS CAME TO ASSIST AT THE FUNERAL
IN THIS NECESSITY I WAS FORCED TO SWIM BEHIND AND PUSH THE BOAT FORWARDS AS OFTEN AS I COULD WITH ONE OF MY HANDS
BUT WHEN I HAD DONE THIS I WAS UNABLE TO STIR IT UP AGAIN OR TO GET UNDER IT MUCH LESS TO MOVE IT FORWARD TOWARDS THE WATER
UNPREPARED FOR SUCH A DESPERATE EFFORT BOIS-GUILBERT HAD TIME NEITHER TO INTERCEPT NOR TO STOP HER
AND THAT SHE WAS TO COME TO THE DIVAN AGAIN THAT DAY THREE MONTHS
HOWEVER AT LOW WATER I WENT ON BOARD AND THOUGH I THOUGHT I HAD RUMMAGED THE CABIN SO EFFECTUALLY THAT NOTHING MORE COULD BE FOUND YET I DISCOVERED A LOCKER WITH DRAWERS IN IT IN ONE OF WHICH I FOUND TWO OR THREE RAZORS AND ONE PAIR OF LARGE SCISSORS WITH SOME TEN OR A DOZEN OF GOOD KNIVES AND FORKS
SO HE TOOK CHRISTIAN BY THE HAND AGAIN AND LED HIM INTO A CHAMBER WHERE THERE WAS ONE RISING OUT OF BED
NOW ORLANDO COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT ROSALIND AND HE WENT ABOUT THE FOREST CARVING HER NAME ON TREES AND WRITING LOVE SONNETS AND HANGING THEM ON THE BUSHES AND THERE ROSALIND AND CELIA FOUND THEM
ITS FLESH WAS CARRION AND FIT FOR NOTHING
THIS DONE HE WITHDRAWS AND LEAVES THEM THERE TO CONDOLE THEIR MISERY AND TO MOURN UNDER THEIR DISTRESS
I HAD NO SOONER FIRED THAN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WOOD THERE AROSE AN INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF FOWLS OF MANY SORTS MAKING A CONFUSED SCREAMING AND CRYING AND EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL NOTE BUT NOT ONE OF THEM OF ANY KIND THAT I KNEW
I RESTED TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND THEN GAVE THE BOAT ANOTHER SHOVE AND SO ON TILL THE SEA WAS NO HIGHER THAN MY ARM-PITS
SHE IN PITY OF THEIR LIVES PRAYED HIM WHO HAD RAISED THIS STORM TO QUELL IT
AS FOR HERMIA AND LYSANDER THEY WERE AS LOVING A COUPLE AS YOU COULD MEET IN A DAY'S MARCH EVEN THROUGH A FAIRY WOOD
THE FELON KNIGHT WHO HAD TAKEN ANOTHER SPEAR WATCHING THE MOMENT WHEN HIS FORMIDABLE ANTAGONIST WAS MOST CLOSELY PRESSED GALLOPED AGAINST HIM IN HOPES TO NAIL HIM WITH HIS LANCE AGAINST THE TREE
SHE LOOKED ON ME WITH SUCH FAVOR WHEN LAST WE MET THAT I FEEL SURE THAT I SHOULD WIN HER AWAY FROM ALL RIVALS FOR HER LOVE HAD I BUT THE MEANS TO GO TO BELMONT WHERE SHE LIVES ALL MY FORTUNES SAID ANTONIO ARE AT SEA AND SO I HAVE NO READY MONEY
WHILE THE ROBBER WHO HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THE MISTAKE UNDERWENT THE SAME PUNISHMENT WHICH HE WILLINGLY SUBMITTED TO
AND NOT CARING IT SEEMS TO VENTURE FAR FROM THE SHORE NOR FAR FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER UNDER A TREE TO CONSIDER IT
AND YET I HAVE SEEN THE MORAL OF MY OWN BEHAVIOR VERY FREQUENTLY IN ENGLAND SINCE MY RETURN
PRAY MY BROTHER FORGIVE ME I DID NOT DO IT OF AN EVIL INTENT
APPROACHING THE CHALLENGERS EACH TOUCHED SLIGHTLY AND WITH THE REVERSE OF HIS LANCE THE SHIELD OF THE ANTAGONIST TO WHOM HE WISHED TO OPPOSE HIMSELF AND THEN RETREATED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE LISTS WHERE ALL REMAINED DRAWN UP IN A LINE
ALI BABA PUT A PIECE OF GOLD INTO THE TABOR AS DID ALSO HIS SON
I POINTED TO THE DEAD RAT SMILING AND MAKING OTHER SIGNS TO SHOW I WAS NOT HURT
HE IS DEAD AH MORGIANA SAID ALI BABA WHAT IS IT YOU SHOW ME
THE SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE ON MY RETURN HOME FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE I HAD ENTIRELY GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHTS OF AGAIN GOING TO SEA
AFTER HE HAD GIVEN WHAT HE BROUGHT INTO ALADDIN'S HANDS HE SALUTED HIS MOTHER AND DESIRED HER TO SHOW HIM THE PLACE WHERE HIS BROTHER MUSTAPHA USED TO SIT ON THE SOFA
THEN THE SIMPLE THING OF DIGGING UP MY TWO CORN-FIELDS LEST THEY SHOULD FIND SUCH A GRAIN THERE AND STILL BE PROMPTED TO FREQUENT THE ISLAND
IT WAS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED THAT THE ATTACKING PARTY WAS A SMUGGLER OR A GIPSY AND THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT TO MURDER THE YOUNG MAN
WE WILL GO NO FURTHER NOW SAID HE TO ALADDIN
WHEN WE CAME TO OUR JOURNEY'S END THE KING THOUGHT PROPER TO PASS A FEW DAYS AT A PALACE HE HAS NEAR FLANFLASNIC A CITY WITHIN EIGHTEEN ENGLISH MILES OF THE SEASIDE
THIS ACCORDINGLY HAPPENED FOR THEY DEVOURED MY COMRADES WHO WERE NOT SENSIBLE OF THEIR CONDITION
THE COUNTRY WAS COVERED WITH SNOW AND I WAS UNACQUAINTED WITH THE ROAD
AFTER SEVERAL CAMPAIGNS AGAINST THE TURKS HE RETIRED FROM THE ARMY AND AMUSED HIMSELF BY TELLING AWFUL WHOPPERS ABOUT HIS BRAVERY AS A SOLDIER AND HUNTSMAN
MAY I NOW GO BACK AND GO UP TO THE WICKET-GATE
AND FINDING FROM HIM THAT HIS SON HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO EVEN WORSE TREATMENT BY AN INVISIBLE AGENCY HE DETERMINED TO DECLARE THE MARRIAGE TO BE CANCELLED AND ALL THE FESTIVITIES WHICH WERE YET TO LAST FOR SEVERAL DAYS TO BE COUNTERMANDED AND TERMINATED
MY DEAR PRINCE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE CRIED THE PRINCESS IN SURPRISE
WHILE THEY WERE SO ENGAGED BERTRAM WITH HIS NEWLY-FOUND SISTER AND MISS MANNERING WENT WALKING TO THE CASTLE OF ELLANGOWAN
WHEN IT WAS THERE HE GAVE DIRECTIONS TO FASTEN ANOTHER CABLE TO THE RING FIXED IN THE COVER AND TO RAISE UP MY CHEST WITH PULLEYS WHICH ALL THE SAILORS WERE NOT ABLE TO DO ABOVE TWO OR THREE FEET
BUT WHEN I HAD WROUGHT OUT SOME BOARDS AS ABOVE I MADE LARGE SHELVES OF THE BREADTH OF A FOOT AND A HALF ONE OVER ANOTHER ALL ALONG ONE SIDE OF MY CAVE TO LAY ALL MY TOOLS NAILS AND IRONWORK ON
HE FOUND THE PLACE OCCUPIED WITH DRAGOONS AND INSTANTLY ENDEAVOURED TO PERSUADE HIS FATHER TO SEND THEM BACK TO THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
AS FOR THAT HE TOLD THEM THEY WERE NOT HIS PRISONERS BUT THE COMMANDER'S OF THE ISLAND
THE PRINCESS ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND RAN OVERJOYED TO EMBRACE HIM
THIS WAS CALIBAN THE SON OF THE WICKED OLD WITCH A HIDEOUS DEFORMED MONSTER HORRIBLE TO LOOK ON AND VICIOUS AND BRUTAL IN ALL HIS HABITS
BUT KNOW MIGHTY CHIEF THOU SHALT HAVE NEITHER ANSWER NOR AID
WHEREFORE HE GETTING UP IN THE MORNING EARLY AND WALKING UP AND DOWN IN HIS FIELDS CAUGHT CHRISTIAN AND HOPEFUL ASLEEP IN HIS GROUNDS
WELL BUT WHAT ART THOU NOW
ABOUT MIDNIGHT ALADDIN'S MOTHER CONDUCTED THE BRIDE TO THE NUPTIAL APARTMENT AND HE SOON AFTER RETIRED
BUT THEN TO THINK THAT SATAN SHOULD TAKE HUMAN SHAPE UPON HIM IN SUCH A PLACE WHERE THERE COULD BE NO MANNER OF OCCASION FOR IT BUT TO LEAVE THE PRINT OF HIS FOOT BEHIND HIM AND THAT EVEN FOR NO PURPOSE TOO FOR HE COULD NOT BE SURE I SHOULD SEE IT--THIS WAS AN AMUSEMENT THE OTHER WAY
ALL WAS NOW BUSTLE AT ELLANGOWAN
AND FOR OUR OWN LIVES SAKE WE MUST TRY AND FIND HIM
THEN THERE CAME TO HIM A HAND WITH SOME OF THE LEAVES OF THE TREE OF LIFE THE WHICH CHRISTIAN TOOK AND APPLIED TO THE WOUNDS THAT HE HAD RECEIVED IN THE BATTLE AND WAS HEALED IMMEDIATELY
BUT ON RETURNING IN THE EVENING HE MET THE TROOP OF GIPSIES
NOR DID THE RUFFIAN RELEASE THE DEADLY GRIP UPON HIS THROAT UNTIL THE LAST REMNANT OF LIFE HAD LEFT HIS VICTIM'S MISERABLE CORPSE
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
APOL
READY SAID PEASEBLOSSOM
WE ROWED WITH ALL OUR MIGHT AND GOT OUT OF THE REACH OF THE GIANTS
HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW SO LARGE A PALACE WHICH HE HAD SEEN PLAINLY EVERY DAY FOR SOME YEARS SHOULD VANISH SO SOON AND NOT LEAVE THE LEAST REMAINS BEHIND
FOR HE WHO WOULD WIN PORTIA'S HEART AND HAND HAD TO GUESS WHICH OF THREE CASKETS HELD HER PORTRAIT
AND THAT I WAS PLAINLY CALLED BY PROVIDENCE TO SAVE THIS POOR CREATURE'S LIFE
BUT I WAS WILLING TO TAKE THEM AT SOME ADVANTAGE SO AS TO SPARE THEM AND KILL AS FEW OF THEM AS I COULD
I GOT ON BOARD THE SHIP AS BEFORE AND PREPARED A SECOND RAFT
AS FOR THE WAY WHICH I PROPOSED TO MYSELF TO GO IN AND OUT FOR I LEFT NO AVENUE IT WAS BY SETTING TWO LADDERS ONE TO A PART OF THE ROCK WHICH WAS LOW AND THEN BROKE IN AND LEFT ROOM TO PLACE ANOTHER LADDER UPON THAT
WELL CONTINUED THE SULTAN WHAT SAYEST THOU TO SUCH A PRESENT
BUT HERE I HAD LIKE TO HAVE SUFFERED A SECOND SHIPWRECK WHICH IF I HAD I THINK VERILY WOULD HAVE BROKEN MY HEART
BUT HE HAD THE PRUDENCE NOT TO MENTION THIS TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO HIS MOTHER
I MADE A SIGN WITH THE LINEN OF MY TURBAN AND CALLED TO THE CREW AS LOUD AS I COULD
THE SULTAN ENTERTAINED ALADDIN WITH THE UTMOST MAGNIFICENCE AND AT NIGHT ON THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARRIAGE CEREMONIES THE PRINCESS TOOK LEAVE OF THE SULTAN HER FATHER
BUT I ENDEAVORED TO DIVERT HIM FROM HIS DESIGN BY MANY ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE TOPICS OF POLICY AS WELL AS JUSTICE
IF THOU ART A CHRISTIAN SPEAK
NOT MANY DAYS PASSED BEFORE THE NUPTIALS OF WILFRED AND THE FAIR ROWENA WERE CELEBRATED IN THE NOBLE MINSTER OF YORK ATTENDED BY THE KING IN PERSON
IN A SHORT TIME YOU'LL BE IN A PLACE OF SAFETY AND REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE TO THE GIPSY WIFE BERTRAM AND DINMONT GOT IN AT ONCE FOLLOWED BY LITTLE WASP AND IN A MOMENT FOUND THEMSELVES TRAVELLING AT A BREAKNECK PACE NEITHER OF THEM KNOWING WHERE ON EARTH THEY WERE GOING TO
THE PRISONER WAS CARRIED OUT STILL FIRMLY BOUND AND ALSO MEG MERRILIES WHO WAS STILL LIVING THOUGH DESPERATELY WOUNDED IN THE CHEST
NEITHER COULD THEY WITH ALL THE SKILL THEY HAD GET AGAIN TO THE STILE THAT NIGHT
THIS LOOKED SEVERE AND CONVINCED THEM THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS IN EARNEST
BUT WHEN THIS WAS WORKED THROUGH AND THIS DIFFICULTY MANAGED IT WAS STILL MUCH THE SAME FOR I COULD NO MORE STIR THE CANOE THAN I COULD THE OTHER BOAT
BUT MANY AS THEY WERE TO ONE THEY HAD MET THEIR MATCH
AND HAVING COMPLETED THE DETAILS OF THIS DESPERATE AND LAWLESS PIECE OF VILLAINY HE WENT BACK TO ELLANGOWAN
SHE DREW BACK IN TERROR AT THE SIGHT OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL HER MISFORTUNES
BUT WHILE SHE WAS PREPARING IT THE LAMP WENT OUT AND THERE WAS NO MORE OIL IN THE HOUSE NOR ANY CANDLES
AND DETERMINED IN COUNCIL THAT I SHOULD BE TIED IN THE MANNER I HAVE RELATED WHICH WAS DONE IN THE NIGHT WHILE I SLEPT THAT PLENTY OF MEAT AND DRINK SHOULD BE SENT TO ME AND A MACHINE PREPARED TO CARRY ME TO THE CAPITAL CITY
NOW CHRISTIAN AGAIN SEEMED TO BE FOR DOING IT BUT HOPEFUL MADE HIS SECOND REPLY AS FOLLOWETH
WHAT HAVE I DONE
THE SAVAGE WHO WAS KNOCKED DOWN RECOVERED HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO SIT UP UPON THE GROUND AND I PERCEIVED THAT MY SAVAGE BEGAN TO BE AFRAID
WE SAW YOUR RAFT AND ONE OF US SWAM INTO THE RIVER AND BROUGHT IT HITHER WHERE WE FASTENED IT AS YOU SEE UNTIL YOU SHOULD AWAKE
I WILL GIVE YOU THE FULL WORTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO SELL OR I WILL DIRECT YOU TO OTHER MERCHANTS WHO WILL NOT CHEAT YOU THIS OFFER INDUCED ALADDIN TO PULL HIS PLATE FROM UNDER HIS VEST AND SHOW IT TO THE GOLDSMITH WHO AT FIRST SIGHT SAW THAT IT WAS MADE OF THE FINEST SILVER AND ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SOLD SUCH AS THAT TO THE JEW
ANOTHER GALLERY RAISED HIGHER THAN THE REST AND OPPOSITE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE SHOCK OF COMBAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE WAS DECORATED WITH MUCH MAGNIFICENCE AND GRACED BY A SORT OF THRONE AND CANOPY ON WHICH THE ROYAL ARMS WERE EMBLAZONED
HE RECEIVED IT WITH ABUNDANCE OF THANKS MORE THAN SUCH A TRIFLE COULD DESERVE
ALARMED AT THIS THEY GALLOPED FULL SPEED TO THE CAVE
ALI BABA'S SON WAS FROM HIS VICINITY ONE OF THE FIRST TO CONVERSE WITH COGIA HOUSSAIN WHO STROVE TO CULTIVATE HIS FRIENDSHIP MORE PARTICULARLY
FOR BEING OUT OF MY DEPTH I WAS NOT ABLE TO WORK
AT THIS INSTANT A KNIGHT URGING HIS HORSE TO SPEED APPEARED ON THE PLAIN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE LISTS
AND IN ANSWER TO BROWN'S INQUIRIES THE BOATMAN TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS WARROCH POINT
IN THE INTERVIEW WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THEM NO ONE ELSE BEING PRESENT IT TRANSPIRED THAT GLOSSIN HAD BEEN A KIND OF PARTNER WITH THE SMUGGLER AT THE TIME OF KENNEDY'S MURDER AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF YOUNG HARRY BERTRAM
BROWN WAS ENTIRELY AT A LOSS TO MAKE OUT THE REASON THE GIPSY HAD FOR TAKING SUCH AN INTEREST IN PRESERVING HIS LIFE FROM HER COMRADES
DIDN'T I TELL YE WHEN YE TOOK AWAY THE BOY HARRY BERTRAM IN SPITE OF MY PRAYERS THAT HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN IN HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR
AS FOR MY BREECHES WHICH WERE ONLY LINEN AND OPEN-KNEED I SWAM ON BOARD IN THEM AND MY STOCKINGS
THE DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE OF KIPPLETRINGAN HE DETERMINED TO SEE MISS MANNERING
HE WAS A GOOD-TEMPERED EASY-GOING KIND OF MAN AND BECAME IN CONSEQUENCE VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE POORER PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE GIPSIES A LARGE NUMBER OF WHOM WERE AT ALL TIMES TO BE FOUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
HE SNATCHED IT EAGERLY OUT OF THE SLAVE'S HAND AND THRUSTING IT AS FAR AS HE COULD INTO HIS BREAST OFFERED HIM HIS BASKET AND BADE HIM CHOOSE WHICH HE LIKED BEST
I MEASURED THE TAIL OF THE DEAD RAT AND FOUND IT TO BE TWO YARDS LONG WANTING AN INCH
FROM THIS TIME HE BELIEVED HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO HAD THE SECRET OF OPENING THE CAVE AND THAT ALL THE TREASURE WAS AT HIS SOLE DISPOSAL
I THOUGHT PRINCE THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AS THE SULTAN MY FATHER'S PALACE BUT THE SIGHT OF THIS HALL ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW I WAS DECEIVED WHEN THE SUPPER WAS ENDED THERE ENTERED A COMPANY OF FEMALE DANCERS WHO PERFORMED ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY SINGING AT THE SAME TIME VERSES IN PRAISE OF THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
BEING ON SHORE THE FIRST THING THEY DID THEY RAN ALL TO THEIR OTHER BOAT
I DID NOT ATTAIN TO THIS HAPPY CONDITION WITHOUT ENDURING FOR SEVERAL YEARS MORE TROUBLE OF BODY AND MIND THAN CAN WELL BE IMAGINED
ADJOINING TO THIS I HAD MY ENCLOSURES FOR MY CATTLE THAT IS TO SAY MY GOATS AND I HAD TAKEN AN INCONCEIVABLE DEAL OF PAINS TO FENCE AND ENCLOSE THIS GROUND
HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN PUT TO SHAMEFUL DEATHS
AFTER WAITING FOR HIM IN ANXIETY FOR SOME TIME THE NEWS CAME IN THAT KENNEDY'S HORSE HAD COME BACK RIDERLESS TO ITS STABLE
AND GETTING ALL INTO HER WE LET GO AND COMMITTED OURSELVES BEING ELEVEN IN NUMBER TO GOD'S MERCY AND THE WILD SEA
IT IS NOT EASY FOR ANY ONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN IN THE LIKE CONDITION TO DESCRIBE OR CONCEIVE THE CONSTERNATION OF MEN IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS BOND GIVES YOU NO RIGHT TO ANTONIO'S BLOOD ONLY TO HIS FLESH
I PRAYED THE MERCHANT WHO OWNED THE NEST TO WHICH I HAD BEEN CARRIED FOR EVERY MERCHANT HAD HIS OWN TO TAKE AS MANY FOR HIS SHARE AS HE PLEASED
A LITTLE AFTER NOON I FOUND THE SEA VERY CALM AND THE TIDE EBBED SO FAR OUT THAT I COULD COME WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE OF THE SHIP
AND BEING ALMOST FAMISHED WITH HUNGER HAVING NOT EATEN A MORSEL FOR SOME HOURS BEFORE I LEFT THE SHIP I FOUND THE DEMANDS OF NATURE SO STRONG UPON ME THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR SHOWING MY IMPATIENCE PERHAPS AGAINST THE STRICT RULES OF DECENCY BY PUTTING MY FINGER FREQUENTLY TO MY MOUTH TO SIGNIFY THAT I WANTED FOOD
THAT FALSE AND WICKED MAGICIAN WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERTAKEN SO LONG A JOURNEY TO SECURE THIS WONDERFUL LAMP IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN ITS VALUE TO EXCEED THAT OF GOLD AND SILVER
HOW SHALL I GRAPPLE WITH THE MISERY THAT I MUST MEET WITH IN ETERNITY
CAPTAIN SAID I LOOK AT ME AND YOU MAY KNOW THAT I AM SINDBAD WHOM YOU LEFT IN THAT DESERT ISLAND THE CAPTAIN HAVING CONSIDERED ME ATTENTIVELY RECOGNIZED ME
IN SHORT I TOOK ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO PRESERVE MY EFFECTS AND TO KEEP UP MY PLANTATION
THIS WAS A NEW PERPLEXITY
COME GOOD HOPEFUL AND LET US GO OVER
I DESIRED THE CAPTAIN WOULD PLEASE TO ACCEPT THIS RING IN RETURN OF HIS CIVILITIES WHICH HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED
I SAW NO ELEPHANT DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING AT BREAK OF DAY I PERCEIVED A GREAT NUMBER
I FOUND TREES EVERYWHERE SOME OF THEM BEARING GREEN AND OTHERS RIPE FRUITS AND STREAMS OF FRESH PURE WATER
HE FOUGHT WITH THE LIONESS AND KILLED HER AND SAVED HIS BROTHER'S LIFE
BUT ROSALIND WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT THIS HANDSOME YOUNG STRANGER WAS THE SON OF HER FATHER'S OLD FRIEND AND AS THEY WERE GOING AWAY SHE TURNED BACK MORE THAN ONCE TO SAY ANOTHER KIND WORD TO THE BRAVE YOUNG MAN
I MADE A GOOD MEAL AND AFTERWARD FELL ASLEEP
APOLLYON BEWARE WHAT YOU DO FOR I AM IN THE KING'S HIGH-WAY THE WAY OF HOLINESS THEREFORE TAKE HEED TO YOURSELF
A GERMAN EDITOR WHO VISITED THE BARON TWO YEARS BEFORE HE DIED WAS TOLD BY THE BARON'S NEIGHBORS THAT HE REALLY DID TELL WONDERFUL STORIES IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AN ADVENTURE WITH A LION AND A CROCODILE BY R
AMONGST THE LATTER WAS ISAAC THE JEW RICHLY AND MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED AND ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DAUGHTER THE BEAUTIFUL REBECCA WHOSE EXQUISITE FORM SHOWN TO ADVANTAGE BY A BECOMING EASTERN DRESS DID NOT ESCAPE THE QUICK EYE OF THE PRINCE HIMSELF AS HE RODE BY AT THE HEAD OF HIS NUMEROUS AND GAILY-DRESSED TRAIN
AND LET US CONSIDER AGAIN THAT ALL THE LAW IS NOT IN THE HAND OF GIANT DESPAIR
ON THIS NIGHT IN A MOSSY MOONLIT GLADE THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES MET
BUT I WAS NOT LONG CONSIDERING THIS
IN THE MORNING HE DYED HIS FACE OF THE SAME HUE AS HERS AND ARRAYING HIMSELF IN HER GARB TAKING HER VEIL THE LARGE NECKLACE SHE WORE ROUND HER WAIST AND HER STICK WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE OF ALADDIN
SAID THE GIANT I WILL THEREFORE SEARCH THEM IN THE MORNING
MY FALL WAS STOPPED BY A TERRIBLE SQUASH THAT SOUNDED LOUDER TO MY EARS THAN THE CATARACT OF NIAGARA
WHEN WE HAD FURLED OUR SAILS THE CAPTAIN TOLD US THAT THIS AND SOME OTHER NEIGHBORING ISLANDS WERE INHABITED BY HAIRY SAVAGES WHO WOULD SPEEDILY ATTACK US
PREPARE THYSELF TO DIE
BOTH I AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP I COMMAND THEE REPLIED THE MAGICIAN TO TRANSPORT ME IMMEDIATELY AND THE PALACE WHICH THOU AND THE OTHER SLAVES OF THE LAMP HAVE BUILT IN THIS DITY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT TO AFRICA THE GENIE MADE NO REPLY BUT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE OTHER GENIES THE SLAVES OF THE LAMP IMMEDIATELY TRANSPORTED HIM AND THE PALACE ENTIRE TO THE SPOT WHITHER HE HAD BEEN DESIRED TO CONVEY IT
PROSPERO WAS A GREAT MAGICIAN FOR HE HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF MAGIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH HE ALLOWED HIS BROTHER TO MANAGE THE AFFAIRS OF MILAN
RASPE I SET OFF FROM ROME ON A JOURNEY TO RUSSIA IN THE MIDST OF WINTER FROM A JUST NOTION THAT FROST AND SNOW MUST OF COURSE MEND THE ROADS WHICH EVERY TRAVELLER HAD DESCRIBED AS UNCOMMONLY BAD THROUGH THE NORTHERN PARTS OF GERMANY POLAND COURLAND AND LIVONIA
AT LAST WE CAME TO OURSELVES AND SAW HIM SITTING IN THE PORCH LOOKING AT US
IF I SOWED MORE CORN THAN I COULD EAT IT MUST BE SPOILED
HE AFTER OBSTINATE AND I TO THIS GATE
AND HERE I MUST NEEDS OBSERVE THAT AS REASON IS THE SUBSTANCE AND ORIGIN OF THE MATHEMATICS SO BY STATING AND SQUARING EVERYTHING BY REASON AND BY MAKING THE MOST RATIONAL JUDGMENT OF THINGS EVERY MAN MAY BE IN TIME MASTER OF EVERY MECHANIC ART
FOR AS HUMAN CREATURES ARE OBSERVED TO BE MORE SAVAGE AND CRUEL IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BULK WHAT COULD I EXPECT BUT TO BE A MORSEL IN THE MOUTH OF THE FIRST AMONG THESE ENORMOUS BARBARIANS THAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO SEIZE ME
ONE OF THOSE KNIVES IS WORTH ALL THIS HEAP
AND I ASK PERMISSION TO DISPOSE OF SIR MAURICE DE BRACY AT MY OWN PLEASURE HE IS ALREADY THINE SAID LOCKSLEY AND WELL FOR HIM DE BRACY SAID THE KNIGHT THOU ART FREE
AND IN PROCESS OF TIME HE GOT UP TO THE GATE
ONE OF THEM CAME UP ALMOST TO MY FACE WHEREUPON I ROSE IN A FRIGHT AND DREW OUT MY HANGER TO DEFEND MYSELF
I SPARED NO PAINS INDEED IN THIS PIECE OF FRUITLESS TOIL AND SPENT I THINK THREE OR FOUR WEEKS ABOUT IT
I WAS THE FAVORITE OF A GREAT KING AND QUEEN AND THE DELIGHT OF THE WHOLE COURT
AND AFTER HAVING SOUGHT FOR US IN VAIN HE GROPED FOR THE GATE AND WENT OUT HOWLING IN AGONY
BUT AT THIS MOMENT THE PARTY OF THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT HAD THE WORST
I KEPT FROM THEM AT AS GREAT A DISTANCE AS I COULD BUT WAS FORCED TO MOVE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY FOR THE STALKS OF CORN WERE SOMETIMES NOT ABOVE A FOOT DISTANT SO THAT I COULD HARDLY SQUEEZE MY BODY BETWEEN THEM
I PRAY YOU TO GRANT ME SUFFICIENT GROUND NEAR YOUR PALACE AND I WILL HAVE IT COMPLETED WITH THE UTMOST EXPEDITION THE SULTAN GRANTED ALADDIN HIS REQUEST AND AGAIN EMBRACED HIM
WE SET SAIL AND STEERED OUR COURSE TOWARD THE INDIES THROUGH THE PERSIAN GULF
THEN ORLANDO LOOKED AT THE MAN AND SAW THAT IT WAS HIS WICKED BROTHER OLIVER WHO HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS LIFE
THE LIONESS HAD WOUNDED ORLANDO'S ARM SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT GO ON TO SEE THE SHEPHERD SO HE SENT HIS BROTHER TO ASK GANYMEDE TO COME TO HIM
I FORTUNATELY RECOLLECTED MY HUNTING KNIFE WHICH WAS BY MY SIDE
HIS FORE TEETH WERE VERY LONG AND SHARP AND STOOD OUT OF HIS MOUTH WHICH WAS AS DEEP AS THAT OF A HORSE
YOU NOT ONLY DESERVE A QUIET LIFE BUT ARE WORTHY OF ALL THE RICHES YOU POSSESS SINCE YOU MAKE SO GOOD A USE OF THEM
BUT ON THE INSTANT PROSPERO CHARMED HIM SO THAT HE STOOD THERE LIKE A STATUE STILL AS STONE
THIS LIQUOR TASTED LIKE A SMALL CIDER AND WAS NOT UNPLEASANT
THE STORY OF ALADDIN
NOW IN ATHENS WHERE THEY LIVED THERE WAS A WICKED LAW BY WHICH ANY GIRL WHO REFUSED TO MARRY ACCORDING TO HER FATHER'S WISHES MIGHT BE PUT TO DEATH
THY WILL BE DONE TURNING THEN TO WILFRED OF IVANHOE HE SAID I PRONOUNCE THE MAIDEN FREE AND GUILTLESS
THE GOLD ONE BORE THIS INSCRIPTION:--"WHO CHOOSETH ME SHALL GAIN WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE
THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT HUSBAND REPLIED SHE
WHEN ALL THE GUESTS HAD ARRIVED DINNER WAS SERVED AND CONTINUED A LONG TIME
BUT THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT WITH ALL COURTESY DECLINED THEIR REQUEST
THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO STATED INHABITANTS WHO LIVED ON THE SPOT YET THAT THERE MIGHT SOMETIMES COME BOATS OFF FROM THE SHORE WHO EITHER WITH DESIGN OR PERHAPS NEVER BUT WHEN THEY WERE DRIVEN BY CROSS WINDS MIGHT COME TO THIS PLACE
BUT COME FOLLOW ME THROUGH THIS PASSAGE THAT I MAY DISMISS THEE BY THE POSTERN AS CEDRIC WAS LEAVING THE CASTLE THE NORMAN GAVE HIM A NOTE TO CARRY TO PHILIP DE MALVOISIN BEGGING HIM TO SEND ASSISTANCE WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD
THAT THEY HID THEMSELVES BY DAY AND CAME ABROAD BY NIGHT
ONCE A KITE HOVERING OVER THE GARDEN MADE A STOOP AT ME AND IF I HAD NOT RESOLUTELY DRAWN MY HANGER AND RUN UNDER A THICK ESPALIER HE WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY CARRIED ME AWAY IN HIS TALONS
AS THEY HAD TO PASS THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS TO THE PALACE THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE WAY WAS LINED WITH FILES OF SPECTATORS
AND AS HE HAD NO OCCASION FOR THE MULES HE SENT THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES TO BE SOLD IN THE MARKET BY HIS SLAVE
BUT ALL THIS WAS IN VAIN AND MY REPENTANCE CAME TOO LATE
I LISTENED I LOOKED ROUND ME BUT I COULD HEAR NOTHING NOR SEE ANYTHING
WHOEVER PERFORMS HIS PART WITH MOST AGILITY AND HOLDS OUT THE LONGEST IN LEAPING AND CREEPING IS REWARDED WITH THE BLUE-COLORED SILK THE RED IS GIVEN TO THE NEXT AND THE GREEN TO THE THIRD WHICH THEY ALL WEAR GIRT TWICE ROUND ABOUT THE MIDDLE AND YOU SEE FEW GREAT PERSONS ABOUT THIS COURT WHO ARE NOT ADORNED WITH ONE OF THESE GIRDLES
WHEN THAT WAS DONE I COVERED IT MYSELF WITH VELVET AND LEATHER AND EMBROIDERED IT WITH GOLD
HATTERAICK WAS ACCORDINGLY THEN SENT TO HIS PLACE OF CONFINEMENT IN THE OLD CASTLE
THIS LETTER INFORMED HIM THAT MISS MANNERING WAS BEING SERENADED AT NIGHT FROM THE LAKE BESIDE THE HOUSE BY SOME UNKNOWN STRANGER WHO HAD HOWEVER DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN
I PRESENTED MY GUN AT HER BUT AS SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONCERNED AT IT NOR DID SHE OFFER TO STIR AWAY
BUT I BELIEVE YOU DID NOT HEAR HIM FOR I THINK YOU FAINTED AS SOON AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK WHAT CRIED THE MOTHER WAS YOUR LAMP THEN THE OCCASION OF THAT CURSED GENIE'S ADDRESSING HIMSELF RATHER TO ME THAN TO YOU
AND DURING THESE TWELVE DAYS I NEED NOT SAY THAT I EXPECTED EVERY DAY TO BE SWALLOWED UP
AND THE SULTAN TELLING THE PRINCESS OF THEIR MAGNIFICENT APPAREL ORDERED THEM TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HER APARTMENT THAT SHE MIGHT SEE THROUGH THE LATTICES HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED IN HIS ACCOUNT OF THEM
BEFORE I SAW HIM I SUSPECTED HIM AS SOON AS YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD SUCH A GUEST
THE SULTAN HAS DECLARED THAT YOU SHALL MARRY THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR
BUT ONLY TO FIND THAT HIS WIFE WAS DEAD THAT A LITTLE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN BORN TO HIM AND THAT HIS BOY WAS GONE
FOR ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN HAD ORDERED A LITTLE EQUIPAGE OF ALL THINGS NECESSARY FOR ME WHILE I WAS IN HER SERVICE YET MY IDEAS WERE WHOLLY TAKEN UP WITH WHAT I SAW ON EVERY SIDE OF ME AND I WINKED AT MY OWN LITTLENESS AS PEOPLE DO AT THEIR OWN FAULTS
GO AND MAKE HASTE AS SOON AS ALADDIN HAD GIVEN THESE ORDERS THE GENIE DISAPPEARED BUT PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE HORSE THE FORTY SLAVES TEN OF WHOM CARRIED EACH A PURSE CONTAINING TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD AND SIX WOMEN SLAVES EACH CARRYING ON HER HEAD A DIFFERENT DRESS FOR ALADDIN'S MOTHER WRAPPED UP IN A PIECE OF SILVER TISSUE AND PRESENTED THEM ALL TO ALADDIN
AND ARIEL INVISIBLE TO FERDINAND HOVERED NEAR HIM SINGING THE WHILE COME UNTO THESE YELLOW SANDS AND THEN TAKE HANDS
AND AS FOR THE CAPTAIN NOW HE HAD LEISURE TO PARLEY WITH THEM HE EXPOSTULATED WITH THEM UPON THE VILLANY OF THEIR PRACTICES WITH HIM AND UPON THE FURTHER WICKEDNESS OF THEIR DESIGN AND HOW CERTAINLY IT MUST BRING THEM TO MISERY AND DISTRESS IN THE END AND PERHAPS TO THE GALLOWS
ON THE ROOF OF MY CLOSET NOT DIRECTLY OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE HAMMOCK I ORDERED THE JOINER TO CUT A HOLE OF A FOOT SQUARE TO GIVE ME AIR IN HOT WEATHER AS I SLEPT
SO WHEN THE MORNING WAS COME THE GIANT GOES TO THEM AGAIN AND TAKES THEM INTO THE CASTLE-YARD AND SHEWS THEM AS HIS WIFE HAD BIDDEN HIM
BUT WHEN THEY CAME NEARER THE CAPTAIN AND FRIDAY STARTING UP ON THEIR FEET LET FLY AT THEM
THEY CONDUCTED ME TO THEIR ENCAMPMENT
BEING IN COMPANY WITH SOME MERCHANTS AND PLANTERS OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AND TALKING OF THINGS VERY EARNESTLY THREE OF THEM CAME TO ME NEXT MORNING AND TOLD ME THEY HAD BEEN MUSING VERY MUCH UPON WHAT I HAD DISCOURSED WITH THEM OF THE LAST NIGHT AND THEY CAME TO MAKE A SECRET PROPOSAL TO ME
AT THE PLACE WHERE THE CARRIAGE STOPPED THERE STOOD AN ANCIENT TEMPLE ESTEEMED TO BE THE LARGEST IN THE WHOLE KINGDOM WHICH HAVING BEEN POLLUTED SOME YEARS BEFORE BY AN UNNATURAL MURDER WAS ACCORDING TO THE ZEAL OF THOSE PEOPLE LOOKED ON AS PROFANE AND THEREFORE HAD BEEN APPLIED TO COMMON USE AND ALL THE ORNAMENTS AND FURNITURE CARRIED AWAY
AND THE OTHER SEEING THE FATE OF HIS COMRADE MADE HIS ESCAPE BUT NOT WITHOUT ONE GOOD WOUND ON THE BACK WHICH I GAVE HIM AS HE FLED AND MADE THE BLOOD RUN TRICKLING FROM HIM
NOW SINDBAD HAD HEARD THE PORTER COMPLAIN THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THIS IT WAS THAT INDUCED HIM TO HAVE HIM BROUGHT IN
WHICH I DID IN FEW WORDS BUT HE THOUGHT I WAS RAVING AND THAT THE DANGERS I UNDERWENT HAD DISTURBED MY HEAD
SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER WHEN THE BLACK KNIGHT REACHED THE ROOM IVANHOE WAS ALONE
FOR FREDERICK HAD BEEN SHOWN BY A HOLY HERMIT THE WICKEDNESS OF HIS WAYS AND SO GAVE BACK THE DUKEDOM OF HIS BROTHER AND HIMSELF WENT INTO A MONASTERY TO PRAY FOR FORGIVENESS
NEITHER DURST I STIR FROM THE POSTURE I WAS IN
AND THEN THE MAGICIAN TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETIRED
AND TO FEED THEM ON BOARD I HAD A GOOD BUNDLE OF HAY AND A BAG OF CORN
HE ALSO ADDED THAT MEG MERRILIES HAD OFTEN SAID THAT HARRY BERTRAM CARRIED THE PROOF OF HIS BIRTH HUNG ROUND HIS NECK
WHY I THOUGHT THAT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WAS COME AND THAT I WAS NOT READY FOR IT
I THEN TOOK MY TACKLING AND FASTENING A HOOK TO THE HOLE AT THE PROW OF EACH I TIED ALL THE CORDS TOGETHER AT THE END
AFTER A LITTLE ONE OF HIS SERVANTS CAME RUNNING TO HIM AND TOLD HIM TO COME HOME AT ONCE THAT MRS BERTRAM WAS DYING
WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED SOME DISTANCE FROM ROTHERWOOD AND WERE APPROACHING THE TOWN OF SHEFFIELD THE JEW EXPRESSED A WISH TO RECOMPENSE THE PALMER FOR THE INTEREST HE HAD TAKEN IN HIS AFFAIRS
AND AS FOR THE INHABITANTS I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE I MIGHT BE A MATCH FOR THE GREATEST ARMY THEY COULD BRING AGAINST ME IF THEY WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE WITH HIM THAT I SAW
I WAS ALMOST CHOKED WITH THE FILTHY STUFF THE MONKEY HAD CRAMMED DOWN MY THROAT
BUT I PRESENTLY THOUGHT OF A STRATAGEM TO FETCH THEM BACK AGAIN AND WHICH ANSWERED MY END TO A TITLE
FOR SEE HERE CONTINUED SHE OPENING THE PRETENDED COGIA HOUSSAIN'S GARMENT AND SHOWING THE DAGGER WHAT AN ENEMY YOU HAD ENTERTAINED
I WAS STRUCK WITH THE UTMOST FEAR AND ASTONISHMENT AND RAN TO HIDE MYSELF IN THE CORN WHENCE I SAW HIM AT THE TOP OF THE STILE LOOKING BACK INTO THE NEXT FIELD ON THE RIGHT HAND AND HEARD HIM CALL IN A VOICE MANY DEGREES LOUDER THAN A SPEAKING TRUMPET
PRODUCED BY RALPH ZIMMERMAN CHARLES FRANKS AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM
BECAUSE HE STAYS FOR THE BEST THINGS
THE OLD LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN WAS SO EXHAUSTED BY HIS LAST EFFORT OF INDIGNANT ANGER THAT WHEN HE SUNK UPON HIS CHAIR HE EXPIRED ALMOST WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
AT WHICH HE FELL INTO A GRIEVOUS RAGE AND TOLD THEM THAT SEEING THEY DISOBEYED HIS COUNSEL IT SHOULD BE WORSE WITH THEM THAN IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BORN
ALADDIN'S MOTHER SEEING THE SULTAN RETIRE AND ALL THE PEOPLE DEPART JUDGED RIGHTLY THAT HE WOULD NOT SIT AGAIN THAT DAY AND RESOLVED TO GO HOME
HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE THE SOLDIERS WITHDRAWN ON SOME PRETENCE OR OTHER SO AS TO MAKE THE RESCUE MORE CERTAIN
I APPREHENDED IT TO BE A ROCK AND FOUND MYSELF TOSSED MORE THAN EVER
IN THIS SAD CONDITION I WAS READY TO DIE WITH GRIEF
AND PRESENTLY THE CONDUCTOR WAS DECLARED BY ALL WORTHY OF DEATH
THEY UNDID IN A FEW HOURS WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SIX WEEKS ABOUT AND RETIRED LEAVING ALADDIN ALONE IN THE HALL
THE MAN THEREFORE READ IT AND LOOKING UPON EVANGELIST VERY CAREFULLY SAID WHITHER MUST I FLY
HE FOUND AS HE HAD TOLD ANTONIO THAT THE RUMOR OF HER WEALTH AND BEAUTY HAD DRAWN TO HER SUITORS FROM FAR AND NEAR
HERE THEY WALLOWED FOR A TIME BEING GRIEVOUSLY BEDAUBED WITH THE DIRT
ALADDIN RESOLVED AT ONCE WHAT TO DO
THE TWO LEADERS CAME FACE TO FACE AND FOUGHT HAND TO HAND ON THE BREACH AMID THE ROAR OF THEIR FOLLOWERS WHO WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE STRIFE
ON THE VERY NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN SET OUT AND TRAVELLED WITH THE UTMOST HASTE TO THE CAPITAL OF CHINA WHERE ON HIS ARRIVAL HE TOOK UP HIS LODGING IN A KHAN
ORLANDO THE YOUNG MAN HE WAS TO WRESTLE WITH WAS SO SLENDER AND YOUTHFUL THAT ROSALIND AND CELIA THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY BE KILLED AS OTHERS HAD BEEN
RETURNING GOD THANKS TO FIND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE WORLD HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY HOME
YOU THINK NO DOUBT THAT I HAVE ACQUIRED WITHOUT LABOR AND TROUBLE THE EASE AND INDULGENCE WHICH I NOW ENJOY
HE PUT HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THE REST WHO FOLLOWED HIM IN LINE ONE AFTER THE OTHER CARRIED ME A CONSIDERABLE WAY THEN LAID ME DOWN ON THE GROUND AND RETIRED WITH ALL HIS COMPANIONS
HE NAMED SEVERAL SORTS OF GRAIN BUT STILL THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN
AND BESIDES THOU COUNTEST HIS SERVICE BETTER THAN MINE WHEREAS HE NEVER CAME YET FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE IS TO DELIVER ANY THAT SERVED HIM OUT OF OUR HANDS
YOU SHALL SEE BY THE DILIGENCE WHICH I USE IN OBTAINING IT THAT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOUR SAKE ALADDIN LEFT THE PRINCESS BUDDIR AL BUDDOOR THAT MOMENT AND WENT UP INTO THE HALL OF FOUR-AND-TWENTY WINDOWS WHERE PULLING OUT OF HIS BOSOM THE LAMP WHICH AFTER THE DANGER HE HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO HE ALWAYS CARRIED ABOUT HIM HE RUBBED IT
AND HE ANSWERED THAT WE WERE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE IN ALL THE OCEAN
SHE RAN TO ALI BABA IN GREAT ALARM AND SAID
SO HE CALLS OUT AS LOUD AS HE COULD TO ONE OF THEM TOM SMITH
THIS I WAS AFTERWARD TOLD FOR I DURST NOT STAY TO SEE THE ISSUE OF THE ADVENTURE BUT RAN AS FAST AS I COULD THE WAY I FIRST WENT AND THEN CLIMBED UP A STEEP HILL WHICH GAVE ME SOME PROSPECT OF THE COUNTRY
WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED IT WELL HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS AS FAR AS SUCH A SOLITARY BEING AS I AM WHO AM UNACQUAINTED WITH WHAT THE WORLD CALLS BEAUTIFUL CAN JUDGE THIS HALL IS TRULY ADMIRABLE
SO ALL THAT DAY THEY SPENT THE TIME IN NOTHING BUT SIGHS AND BITTER LAMENTATIONS
WHEN THE SHIPS CAME UP I STRIPPED MYSELF AND WADED TILL I CAME WITHIN AN HUNDRED YARDS OF THE BOAT AFTER WHICH I WAS FORCED TO SWIM TILL I GOT UP TO IT
COME FAIRIES LET US LEAVE HIM
I CALLED AS LOUD AS I COULD AND UNFOLDING THE LINEN OF MY TURBAN DISPLAYED IT THAT THEY MIGHT OBSERVE ME
HI DIANA I CRIED
NOW I HEAR THEM DING DONG BELL AND SO SINGING ARIEL LED THE SPELL-BOUND PRINCE INTO THE PRESENCE OF PROSPERO AND MIRANDA
BROWN'S VISIT TO DANDIE DINMONT WAS NOW AT AN END AND HE AGAIN TOOK THE ROAD FOR WOODBOURNE THE RESIDENCE OF JULIA MANNERING
THE MERCHANTS WITH WHOM I WAS GATHERED STONES AND THREW THEM AT THE APES ON THE TREES
THESE WERE CONDITIONS THAT FRIGHTENED AWAY MANY AN ARDENT WOOER
THE CALIPH SAID HE HAS SENT ME TO TELL YOU THAT HE MUST SPEAK WITH YOU I FOLLOWED THE OFFICER TO THE PALACE WHERE BEING PRESENTED TO THE CALIPH I SALUTED HIM BY PROSTRATING MYSELF AT HIS FEET
I THEN SHOWED HIM THE GOLD GIVEN ME BY THE EMPEROR OF BLEFUSCU TOGETHER WITH HIS MAJESTY'S PICTURE AT FULL LENGTH AND SOME OTHER RARITIES OF THAT COUNTRY
SO THAT I WAS NOT IN ANY DANGER OF LEAVING MY FAMILY UPON THE PARISH
WHEN THEY ROSE THE BLACK SLAVES UNCOVERED THE TRAYS AND THEN ALL STOOD WITH THEIR ARMS CROSSED OVER THEIR BREASTS
THE ROBBER SALUTED HIM BIDDING HIM GOOD-MORROW
AS THEY WERE CREEPING IN DINMONT WHO WAS LAST OF THE PARTY FELT HIS LEG CAUGHT BY SOMEONE FROM BEHIND
HE SENT ME TO EMMANUEL COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE AT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WHERE I RESIDED THREE YEARS AND APPLIED MYSELF CLOSE TO MY STUDIES
AS FOR MYSELF IT WAS NO GREAT HARM FOR I WAS NEAR THE SHORE
DID I DESERVE NO MORE THAN A FOOL'S HEAD HE CRIED
AS THE COLONEL'S CLOCK WAS STRIKING ONE THAT NIGHT THE SOUND OF CARRIAGE WHEELS WAS HEARD IN THE DISTANCE AND IN NO LONG SPACE AFTER BERTRAM AND DINMONT FOUND THEMSELVES AT WOODBOURNE
BUT AFTER A STRUGGLE WITH HER CURIOSITY SHE CONTENTED HERSELF WITH MAKING A SMALL VELVET BAG INTO WHICH SHE SEWED THE PAPER AND THE WHOLE WAS THEN HUNG AS A CHARM ROUND THE NECK OF HER YOUNG CHILD
AFTER THEY HAD FINISHED SUPPER ALI BABA CHARGING MORGIANA AFRESH TO TAKE CARE OF HIS GUEST SAID TO HER TO-MORROW MORNING I DESIGN TO GO TO THE BATH BEFORE DAY
THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HIS VOICE AND ACTIONS ARE NOT EXCEPT PERHAPS IN A SLIGHT DEGREE AFFECTED BY THE EMOTIONS HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXPERIENCING
WE WOULD NOT GET DOWN OUR TOPMAST BUT LET ALL STAND BECAUSE SHE SCUDDED BEFORE THE SEA VERY WELL AND WE KNEW THAT THE TOPMAST BEING ALOFT THE SHIP WAS THE WHOLESOMER AND MADE BETTER WAY THROUGH THE SEA SEEING WE HAD SEA-ROOM
AS I IMAGINED SO IT WAS
AND WITH THAT HE OPENED THE GATE
I TEMPTED THE DEVIL AND HE IS COME TO ME
I HAVE FOMENTED THE QUARRELS OF OUR FOES
THAT MY CLOSET WAS HUNG ON ALL SIDES OR RATHER QUILTED WITH SILK AND COTTON
ON RETURNING TO HIS HOUSE ONE DAY HE WAS INFORMED THAT MAC GUFFOG THE THIEF-TAKER HAD MADE A PRISONER AND THAT HE WAS WAITING WITH HIM IN THE KITCHEN
AND THAT WHATEVER WE MAY HEAP UP TO GIVE OTHERS WE ENJOY JUST AS MUCH AS WE CAN USE AND NO MORE
SHE HAS BETRAYED US TO THE SAXON CALL ON THEM AGAIN VALIANT BARON SAID THE HAG WITH A SMILE OF GRISLY MOCKERY
FOR HE TREATED THEM KINDLY AS LONG AS THEY DID HIS BIDDING AND HE EXERCISED HIS POWER OVER THEM WISELY AND WELL
BUT LET US NOT BE OUR OWN MURDERERS
THUS THEREFORE THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER
BUT AS I WALKED ON THE TABLE BEING AT GREAT SURPRISE ALL THE TIME AS THE INDULGENT READER WILL EASILY CONCEIVE AND EXCUSE I HAPPENED TO STUMBLE AGAINST A CRUST AND FELL FLAT ON MY FACE BUT RECEIVED NO HURT
ALL THESE HE PLACED UPON A CARPET AND DISAPPEARED
AND THE VERY SIGHT OF HIM BECAME HATEFUL TO THE UNHAPPY GODFREY BERTRAM
THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS OBSTINATE AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER WAS PLIABLE
GO AND EXECUTE MY WISHES WHEN ALADDIN GAVE THESE COMMANDS TO THE GENIE THE SUN WAS SET
FROM HENCE WE WENT TO OTHER ISLANDS AND AT LAST HAVING TOUCHED AT SEVERAL TRADING TOWNS OF THE CONTINENT WE LANDED AT BUSSORAH FROM WHENCE I PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD
SO THAT IF I HAD TAKEN OFF MY BELT BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP I MUST HAVE INFALLIBLY BEEN TORN TO PIECES AND DEVOURED
I FELT MY BOX RAISED VERY HIGH IN THE AIR AND THEN BORNE FORWARD WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED
REMEMBERING THE WORDS THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS USED TO CAUSE THE DOOR TO OPEN AND SHUT HE HAD THE CURIOSITY TO TRY IF HIS PRONOUNCING THEM WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT
THE READER MAY PLEASE TO OBSERVE THAT IN THE LAST ARTICLE FOR THE RECOVERY OF MY LIBERTY THE EMPEROR STIPULATES TO ALLOW ME A QUANTITY OF MEAT AND DRINK SUFFICIENT FOR THE SUPPORT OF 1724 LILLIPUTIANS
PRAY TELL ME WHAT BEFELL YOU I SATISFIED HIS CURIOSITY AND WE BOTH OF US SET OUT NEXT MORNING TO THE HILL
THE COUNTERFEIT FATIMA ADVANCED TOWARD HIM WITH HIS HAND ALL THE TIME ON A DAGGER CONCEALED IN HIS GIRDLE UNDER HIS GOWN
BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAME ALONE
AND ALL MY COMPANIONS EXCEPT THE TWO WITH ME WERE DROWNED
HAVING THUS FIXED FIFTY HOOKS TO AS MANY CABLES I WENT BACK TO THE NORTHEAST COAST AND PUTTING OFF MY COAT SHOES AND STOCKINGS WALKED INTO THE SEA IN MY LEATHERN JERKIN ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE HIGH WATER
I MYSELF WAS OF THE NUMBER OF THE LATTER
WILL YOU GO BACK WITH US OR NO
BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS WOOD THEN OBERON CALLED HIS FAVORITE FAIRY PUCK
THE END OF IT WAS THAT HELENA AND HERMIA BEGAN TO QUARREL AND DEMETRIUS AND LYSANDER WENT OFF TO FIGHT
UPON THIS I SEEMED A LITTLE ANGRY WITH THE CAPTAIN AND TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE MY PRISONERS NOT HIS
AFTER TRAVELLING THUS FOR SOME TIME SHE CAME AT LENGTH TO THE RUINED TOWER WHERE BERTRAM HAD PREVIOUSLY SPENT THE NIGHT IN CONCEALMENT FROM THE SMUGGLERS
I AM SINDBAD SAID I AND THOSE BALES MARKED WITH HIS NAME ARE MINE WHEN THE CAPTAIN HEARD ME SPEAK THUS HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED WHOM CAN WE TRUST IN THESE TIMES
I SURVIVED ALL MY COMPANIONS
THE KEEPER HOWEVER TOLD HIM THAT AS THE PRISON RULES WERE NOW MUCH STRICTER THAN BEFORE HIS SEEING HATTERAICK WOULD BE ONLY ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT WITH HIM
I MADE MY ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY PROSTRATING MYSELF AT HIS MAJESTY'S FEET BUT HE COMMANDED ME TO RISE
BUT A PROCLAMATION WAS SOON ISSUED TO FORBID IT UPON PAIN OF DEATH
HE SOON FOUND AN OPENING IN ONE OF THE WALLS THROUGH WHICH HE COULD OBSERVE MEG MERRILIES WITHOUT HIMSELF BEING SEEN
THEY SOON RETURNED AND WE OBSERVED THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED BETWEEN ITS TALONS AN ENORMOUS ROCK
ONLY COME ALONG WITH ME AND FEAR NOTHING BABA MUSTAPHA WENT WITH MORGIANA WHO AFTER SHE HAD BOUND HIS EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AT THE PLACE SHE HAD MENTIONED CONVEYED HIM TO HER DECEASED MASTER'S HOUSE AND NEVER UNLOOSED HIS EYES TILL HE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD PUT THE CORPSE TOGETHER
AND THEN SINKING YET FARTHER FORWARD LAY PROSTRATE AT HER FEET
I NOW HEARD A TRAMPLING OVER MY HEAD AND SOMEBODY CALLING THROUGH THE HOLE WITH A LOUD VOICE IN THE ENGLISH TONGUE IF THERE BE ANYBODY BELOW LET THEM SPEAK
MY COMRADES NOT TAKING NOTICE THAT THE BLACKS ATE NONE OF IT THEMSELVES THOUGHT ONLY OF SATISFYING THEIR HUNGER AND ATE WITH GREEDINESS
FOR THIS RAFT WAS SO UNWIELDY AND SO OVERLADEN THAT AFTER I HAD ENTERED THE LITTLE COVE WHERE I HAD LANDED THE REST OF MY GOODS NOT BEING ABLE TO GUIDE IT SO HANDILY AS I DID THE OTHER IT OVERSET AND THREW ME AND ALL MY CARGO INTO THE WATER
HE FELL DOWN AT MY FEET
TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME THE BLACK KNIGHT WHISPERED SOMETHING INTO THE EAR OF THE VANQUISHED
ALI BABA WITH GREAT PLEASURE TOOK THE TREAT UPON HIMSELF
AND NOW I WAS CALLED GOVERNOR AGAIN
AND WAS EVEN MORE PUZZLED BY HER CONDUCT WHEN SHE TOOK AN OLD PURSE FROM HER POCKET BEFORE PARTING AND GAVE IT TO HIM
I APPEALED IN VAIN
IN THE MEANTIME THERE SUDDENLY FELL SUCH A VIOLENT SHOWER OF HAIL THAT I WAS IMMEDIATELY BY THE FORCE OF IT STRUCK TO THE GROUND
I HAD SUNK DOWN TO THE CHURCH-YARD WHILST ASLEEP GENTLY AND IN THE SAME PROPORTION AS THE SNOW HAD MELTED AWAY
BUT WHILE I WAS PREPARING THIS I FOUND THE SKY OVERCAST AND THE WIND BEGAN TO RISE AND IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT BLEW A FRESH GALE FROM THE SHORE
WHEN I HAD FINISHED I LOADED IT WITH SOME CHESTS OF RUBIES EMERALDS AMBERGRIS ROCK CRYSTAL AND BALES OF RICH STUFFS
WHEREFORE CHRISTIAN WAS LEFT TO TUMBLE IN THE SLOUGH OF DISPOND ALONE
THEY CONTINUED DRINKING AND TALKING FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME BUT ALL THAT BROWN COULD MAKE OUT WAS THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE WHOM THEY WERE GOING TO MURDER
UPON WHICH THE REST YIELDED AND THE SHIP WAS TAKEN EFFECTUALLY WITHOUT ANY MORE LIVES LOST
AND WITH THAT CHRISTIAN'S SWORD FLEW OUT OF HIS HAND
I HOPE BEFORE THAT TIME MY SON WHOM YOU HAVE REGARDED WITH YOUR FAVOR WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE A NOBLER PRESENT THAN THIS ALADDIN WHO IS AN ENTIRE STRANGER TO YOUR MAJESTY THE SULTAN GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND HE SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN GOOD WOMAN GO HOME AND TELL YOUR SON THAT I AGREE TO THE PROPOSAL YOU HAVE MADE ME
AND THEN WAS MY NEIGHBOR PLIABLE DISCOURAGED AND WOULD NOT ADVENTURE FURTHER
AND KNOW TOO EVEN NOW THE DOOM WHICH ALL THY POWER AND STRENGTH IS UNABLE TO AVOID THOUGH IT IS PREPARED FOR THEE BY THIS FEEBLE HAND
WE BELAYED THE FORE DOWNHAUL
MEG MERRILIES ON REACHING THE INTERIOR WAS GREETED BY DIRCK HATTERAICK WITH A CURSE IN HIS OLD FASHION--THE SMUGGLER HAD BEEN EXPECTING HER AND WAS WAITING WITH ANXIETY FOR NEWS OF HIS BAND
THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD SET HIM ON SHORE IN A BARREN UNINHABITED ISLAND BUT IT HAD PLEASED GOD SO TO DIRECT THEM THAT IT WAS INHABITED AND THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
SO HE CHOSE THE GOLD CASKET AND FOUND INSIDE THE LIKENESS OF WHAT MANY MEN DESIRE--DEATH
MAURICE DE BRACY I SAY BEWARE DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
THE MOMENT HOWEVER HE SAW HIS LEADER SO HARD BESTEAD HE SEEMED TO THROW ASIDE HIS APATHY AND SETTING SPURS TO HIS HORSE HE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT EXCLAIMING IN A VOICE LIKE A TRUMPET CALL DISINHERITED TO THE RESCUE UNDER THE FURY OF HIS FIRST STROKE FRONT-DE-BOEUF HORSE AND ALL ROLLED STUNNED TO THE GROUND
THEY TOOK DOWN OUR SAILS CUT THE CABLE AND HAULING TO THE SHORE MADE US ALL GET OUT AND AFTERWARD CARRIED THE SHIP INTO ANOTHER ISLAND WHENCE THEY HAD COME
BUT SINCE YOU DESIRE I WILL TRY WHAT I CAN DO AT THESE WORDS BABA MUSTAPHA ROSE UP TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE ROBBER AND LED HIM TO THE PLACE WHERE MORGIANA HAD BOUND HIS EYES
BUT THAT WE MAY NOT EXCITE ANY SUSPICION LET ONLY ONE OR TWO GO INTO THE TOWN TOGETHER AND JOIN AT OUR RENDEZVOUS WHICH SHALL BE THE GREAT SQUARE
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I CLIMBED UP TO THE TOP OF A LOFTY TREE FROM WHICH I LOOKED ABOUT ON ALL SIDES TO SEE IF I COULD DISCOVER ANYTHING THAT COULD GIVE ME HOPES
HE CHANCED ON BOARD TO MEET A MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS AT THE TIME IN COLONEL MANNERING'S SERVICE AT WOODBOURNE AND BY HIS MEANS CONTRIVED TO GET A LETTER DELIVERED TO MISS MANNERING IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HER TO FORGIVE HIM FOR HIS RASH CONDUCT TOWARDS HAZLEWOOD
FOR WHERE IN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES SHALL WE FIND WALLS BUILT OF MASSY GOLD AND SILVER AND DIAMONDS RUBIES AND EMERALDS COMPOSING THE WINDOWS
THEY CHATTERED AS THEY CAME NEAR BUT WE UNDERSTOOD NOT THEIR LANGUAGE
I AM WILLING WITH ALL MY HEART SAID HE
CHILD SAID SHE TO WHOM ARE WE OBLIGED FOR THIS GREAT PLENTY AND LIBERALITY
I FOUND HER BONES IN A HOLE PICKED CLEAN FROM THE FLESH
MY DAUGHTER BETTY WHO IS NOW WELL MARRIED AND HAS CHILDREN WAS THEN AT HER NEEDLEWORK
CHRISTIAN BEGAN TO GIRD UP HIS LOINS AND TO ADDRESS HIMSELF TO HIS JOURNEY
THEN I TOOK UP THE KNOTTED END OF THE CABLES TO WHICH MY HOOKS WERE TIED AND WITH GREAT EASE DREW FIFTY OF THE ENEMY'S LARGEST MEN-OF-WAR AFTER ME
AND CONTINUING IN HIS MIRTH PROTESTED HE WOULD HAVE GLADLY GIVEN A HUNDRED POUNDS TO HAVE SEEN MY CLOSET IN THE EAGLE'S BILL AND AFTERWARD IN ITS FALL FROM SO GREAT A HEIGHT INTO THE SEA
I DESIRE NO OTHER REWARD FOR THE SERVICE I HAD THE GOOD-FORTUNE TO DO TO YOU AND YOUR CITY BUT LEAVE TO RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY VERY WELL SAID HE THE MONSOON WILL IN A LITTLE TIME BRING SHIPS FOR IVORY
I COULD NEVER FORGET THESE DOMESTIC PLEDGES I HAD LEFT BEHIND ME
HE TOOK THE LAMP WHICH HE CARRIED ABOUT HIM RUBBED IT AND PRESENTLY THE GENIE APPEARED
THEY WERE SO ASTONISHED AT THE SURPRISE OF THIS THAT AS THEY TOLD US AFTERWARDS THEY RESOLVED TO GO ALL ON BOARD AGAIN TO THEIR SHIP AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THE MEN WERE ALL MURDERED AND THE LONG BOAT STAVED
FOR THOUGHT HE HAD I NO MORE IN MINE EYE THAN THE SAVING OF MY LIFE TWOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO STAND
BUT TIME HAD GRIZZLED HER RAVEN LOCKS AND ADDED MANY WRINKLES TO HER WILD FEATURES
IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF THAT I PRAY THIS FAVOUR SAID REBECCA
HOWEVER I THANKED HIM FOR HIS GOOD OPINION AND PROMISED TO TAKE THE MATTER INTO MY THOUGHTS
HE WAS CLOATHED WITH SCALES LIKE A FISH AND THEY ARE HIS PRIDE
NOW GIANT DESPAIR HAD A WIFE AND HER NAME WAS DIFFIDENCE
BUT MAKING FOUL WEATHER WE LOOKED THE GUNS WERE ALL FAST AND HANDED THE MIZZEN
AS WE SAILED FROM THIS ISLAND WE SAW A TORTOISE TWENTY CUBITS IN LENGTH AND BREADTH
I YIELD ME TO BE TRUE PRISONER RESCUE OR NO RESCUE THEN ANSWERED DE BRACY IN A TONE OF SULLEN SUBMISSION
THE MASTER OF THE SHOP TOLD HIM HE HAD NOT SO MANY BY HIM BUT IF HE WOULD HAVE PATIENCE TILL THE NEXT DAY HE WOULD HAVE THEM READY
THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THOUSANDS APPLAUDED THE AWARD OF THE PRINCE ANNOUNCING THAT DAY'S HONOURS TO THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT
IN THAT WAR-CRY IS THE DOWNFALL OF THY HOUSE
ANY ONE MAY GUESS HOW READILY SUCH A PROPOSAL WOULD BE ACCEPTED BY MEN IN THEIR CONDITION
THE SIX SLAVES WHO CARRIED THE PURSES HE ORDERED LIKEWISE TO MARCH BEFORE HIM THREE ON THE RIGHT HAND AND THREE ON THE LEFT
AND ALADDIN WHO HAD ENCUMBERED HIMSELF SO MUCH WITH HIS FRUIT THAT HE COULD NOT WELL GET AT IT REFUSED TO GIVE IT HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF THE CAVE
IF WE DO NOT SAID THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT THE FAULT WILL NOT BE MINE
THEY WILL HAVE WORK TO-NIGHT
POOR LUCY BERTRAM NOW FOUND HERSELF AN ORPHAN WITHOUT HOUSE OR HOME
BUT NOW HE IS COMFORTED AND THOU ART TORMENTED
THIS I NOT ONLY THOUGHT POSSIBLE BUT EASY AND PLEASED MYSELF EXTREMELY WITH THE THOUGHTS OF MAKING IT AND WITH MY HAVING MUCH MORE CONVENIENCE FOR IT THAN ANY OF THE NEGROES OR INDIANS
THE FOLLOWING DAY TO OUR GREAT TERROR WE SAW THE SERPENT AGAIN WHEN I EXCLAIMED O HEAVEN TO WHAT DANGERS ARE WE EXPOSED
AS SOON AS THEY GOT IN ORDER THEY DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTIES PERFORMED MOCK SKIRMISHES DISCHARGED BLUNT ARROWS DREW THEIR SWORDS FLED AND PURSUED ATTACKED AND RETIRED AND IN SHORT DISCOVERED THE BEST MILITARY DISCIPLINE I EVER BEHELD
AND CONSIDERING SHE WANTED VARIOUS UTENSILS BORROWED THEM OF HER NEIGHBORS
I HAD BEEN OUT SHOOTING ALL DAY AND HAD QUITE EXPENDED MY POWDER AND SHOT WHEN I FOUND MYSELF UNEXPECTEDLY IN PRESENCE OF A STATELY STAG LOOKING AT ME AS UNCONCERNEDLY AS IF HE HAD KNOWN OF MY EMPTY POUCHES
LET US REST OURSELVES AND WE SHALL BE BETTER ABLE TO PURSUE OUR WALK THE MAGICIAN NEXT PULLED FROM HIS GIRDLE A HANDKERCHIEF WITH CAKES AND FRUIT AND DURING THIS SHORT REPAST HE EXHORTED HIS NEPHEW TO LEAVE OFF BAD COMPANY AND TO SEEK THAT OF WISE AND PRUDENT MEN TO IMPROVE BY THEIR CONVERSATION
SO I GUIDED MY RAFT AS WELL AS I COULD TO KEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREAM
AND UNDER THIS I HAD MADE ME A SQUAB OR COUCH WITH THE SKINS OF THE CREATURES I HAD KILLED AND WITH OTHER SOFT THINGS AND A BLANKET LAID ON THEM SUCH AS BELONGED TO OUR SEA-BEDDING WHICH I HAD SAVED
I THEN TOOK OFF MY SPECTACLES AND WAITING ABOUT AN HOUR TILL THE TIDE WAS A LITTLE FALLEN I WADED THROUGH THE MIDDLE WITH MY CARGO AND ARRIVED SAFE AT THE ROYAL PORT OF LILLIPUT
AND THUS THEY CAME UP TO THE GATE
WHY IN THAT CASE SAID GLOSSIN YOU ARE MY PRISONER IN THE KING'S NAME AFTER A SLIGHT RESISTANCE THE PRISONER WAS SECURED AND SHORTLY AFTER WAS BROUGHT BEFORE SIR ROBERT HAZLEWOOD ONE OF THE COUNTY MAGISTRATES AND ACCUSED OF MALICIOUSLY WOUNDING CHARLES HAZLEWOOD HIS SON
THE SPOT WHERE IT LEFT ME WAS ENCOMPASSED ON ALL SIDES BY MOUNTAINS THAT SEEMED TO REACH ABOVE THE CLOUDS AND SO STEEP THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF GETTING OUT OF THE VALLEY
IT LAY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE WATER AND NOT MORE
FOR WHAT WE TOOK FOR AN ISLAND PROVED TO BE THE BACK OF A SEA MONSTER
AND EACH KNIGHT REPAIRED HASTILY TO HIS POST AND AT THE HEAD OF THE FEW FOLLOWERS WHOM THEY WERE ABLE TO MUSTER THEY AWAITED WITH CALM DETERMINATION THE THREATENED ASSAULT
I WILL PREPARE AT ONCE TO SATISFY HIS REQUEST ALADDIN RETIRED TO HIS OWN APARTMENT AND SUMMONED THE GENIE OF THE LAMP AND REQUIRED HIM TO IMMEDIATELY PREPARE AND PRESENT THE GIFT BEFORE THE SULTAN CLOSED HIS MORNING AUDIENCE ACCORDING TO THE TERMS IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED
ARISTOTLE
HE WAS VERY WELL PLEASED AND ORDERED ME ONE THOUSAND SEQUINS FOR THE EXPENSES OF MY JOURNEY
FOR I HAD LITTLE OR NOTHING WITHIN DOORS BUT SOME BARLEY-CAKES AND WATER
BUT BEING AFRAID THE BOY MIGHT OWE ME A SPITE AND WELL REMEMBERING HOW MISCHIEVOUS ALL CHILDREN AMONG US NATURALLY ARE TO SPARROWS RABBITS YOUNG KITTENS AND PUPPY DOGS I FELL ON MY KNEES AND POINTING TO THE BOY MADE MY MASTER TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS I COULD THAT I DESIRED HIS SON MIGHT BE PARDONED
AND THEY FIRED SEVERAL TIMES MAKING OTHER SIGNALS FOR THE BOAT
BUT DO NOT SEPARATE FROM THEM OTHERWISE YOU MAY ENDANGER YOUR LIFE HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE GAVE ME PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY AND I WENT WITH THEM
DIE LIKE A MAN OR BE HANGED LIKE A DOG
MANY'S THE ALMS YOUR HOUSE HAS GIVEN MEG AND HERS AND BROWN AS HE THANKED HER FOR HER KINDNESS ASKED HER HOW HE COULD REPAY THE MONEY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM
SELDOM STAYING ONE NIGHT ON SHORE LEST THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE HELP OF THE TIDES AND DAYLIGHT BACK AGAIN
I WENT ROUND TO SEE IF IT WAS OPEN ON ANY SIDE BUT SAW IT WAS NOT AND THAT THERE WAS NO CLIMBING UP TO THE TOP AS IT WAS SO SMOOTH
OUT OF MY SIGHT YE VIPER HE SAID
I WARRANT I WILL FIND SOME WAY OR OTHER TO GET IT ALONG WHEN IT IS DONE THIS WAS A MOST PREPOSTEROUS METHOD
ALTHOUGH I MUST BEG LEAVE TO SAY FOR MYSELF THAT I AM AS FAIR AS MOST OF MY SEX AND COUNTRY AND VERY LITTLE SUNBURNED BY ALL MY TRAVELS
BUT IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY
I HAVE PROVOKED GOD TO ANGER AND HE HAS LEFT ME
AND IN MY DISCOURSES AMONG THEM I HAD FREQUENTLY GIVEN THEM AN ACCOUNT OF MY TWO VOYAGES TO THE COAST OF GUINEA THE MANNER OF TRADING WITH THE NEGROES THERE AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO PURCHASE UPON THE COAST FOR TRIFLES SUCH AS BEADS TOYS KNIVES SCISSORS HATCHETS BITS OF GLASS AND THE LIKE NOT ONLY GOLD DUST GUINEA GRAINS ELEPHANTS TEETH ETC BUT NEGROES FOR THE SERVICE OF THE BRAZILS IN GREAT NUMBERS
IT WAS RECKONED THAT ABOVE AN HUNDRED THOUSAND INHABITANTS CAME OUT OF THE TOWN UPON THE SAME ERRAND
FOR AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO I USED BUT LITTLE AND WASTED NONE
I HAD SCARCELY PLACED MYSELF IN THIS POSTURE WHEN ONE OF THE EAGLES HAVING TAKEN ME UP WITH THE PIECE OF MEAT TO WHICH I WAS FASTENED CARRIED ME TO HIS NEST ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
I RETREATED TO THE FURTHER CORNER OF MY ROOM OR BOX
I ASKED WHETHER HE OR THE CREW HAD SEEN ANY PRODIGIOUS BIRDS IN THE AIR ABOUT THE TIME HE FIRST DISCOVERED ME
UPON WHICH THESE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURE CAME INTO MY THOUGHTS CALL UPON ME IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE AND I WILL DELIVER THEE AND THOU SHALT GLORIFY ME UPON THIS RISING CHEERFULLY OUT OF MY BED MY HEART WAS NOT ONLY COMFORTED BUT I WAS GUIDED AND ENCOURAGED TO PRAY EARNESTLY TO GOD FOR DELIVERANCE
THEY FIRST DREW UP THE MAN-SERVANT
MUSTAPHA CHASTISED HIM
BUT THE BLOOD AND THE FAT OF THE ELEPHANT RUNNING INTO HIS EYES AND MAKING HIM BLIND HE FALLS TO THE GROUND
AT THE FLOURISH OF CLARIONS AND TRUMPETS THEY STARTED OUT AGAINST EACH OTHER AT FULL GALLOP
WAIT I SAY ON THE LORD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS THE COMFORT THIS GAVE ME
AND BELIEVE TOO THAT THIS SHALL BE FOR OUR GOOD CHR
THEY ARE TRAINED IN THIS ART FROM THEIR YOUTH AND ARE NOT ALWAYS OF NOBLE BIRTH OR LIBERAL EDUCATION
YET I WAS SO WEAK AND BRUISED IN THE SIDES WITH THE SQUEEZES GIVEN ME BY THIS ODIOUS ANIMAL THAT I WAS FORCED TO KEEP MY BED A FORTNIGHT
IT IS TRUE I DO NOT SEE THE PALACE
BERTRAM HERE PRODUCED THE VELVET BAG WHICH HAD BEEN WORKED BY HIS MOTHER AND WHICH HE SAID HE HAD ALWAYS CONTINUED TO WEAR
I HAVE SEEN HIM DO THE SOMERSET SEVERAL TIMES TOGETHER UPON A TRENCHER FIXED ON THE ROPE WHICH IS NO THICKER THAN A COMMON PACKTHREAD IN ENGLAND
AND THERE YOU SHALL WITH JOY RECEIVE EVEN EVERY ONE THAT FOLLOWS INTO THE HOLY PLACE AFTER YOU
OF THE TEN PURSES ALADDIN TOOK FOUR WHICH HE GAVE TO HIS MOTHER TELLING HER THOSE WERE TO SUPPLY HER WITH NECESSARIES
BUT JUST ABOUT THIS TIME THE LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN WAS APPOINTED ONE OF THE MAGISTRATES OF THE COUNTY
BUT THEY WERE MUCH MORE SURPRISED WHEN I TOLD THEM MY STORY
RUBIES AND SEVERAL SORTS OF MINERALS ABOUND
AND DURING THAT TIME WE MADE SO MANY JOURNEYS TO THE HILL THAT WE FILLED ALL OUR WAREHOUSES WITH IVORY
TWELVE OF OUR CREW WERE DEAD BY IMMODERATE LABOR AND ILL FOOD THE REST WERE IN A VERY WEAK CONDITION
AND NOT BEING ABLE LONGER TO CONTAIN HE BRAKE OUT WITH A LAMENTABLE CRY SAYING WHAT SHALL I DO
BUT I MUST OBSERVE TOO THAT AT FIRST THIS WAS A CONFUSED HEAP OF GOODS WHICH AS THEY LAY IN NO ORDER SO THEY TOOK UP ALL MY PLACE--I HAD NO ROOM TO TURN MYSELF
BUT NOW EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS ALSO BITE ME AND GNAW ME LIKE A BURNING WORM
THE COMPANY WERE THE FARMER AND HIS WIFE THREE CHILDREN AND AN OLD GRANDMOTHER
THEN WAS HIS FELLOW SILENT AS MISTRUSTING THAT HE HAD LED HIM OUT OF THE WAY
AND WHEN THE MATE WITH A CROW SPLIT OPEN THE DOOR THE NEW CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN FIRED BOLDLY AMONG THEM AND WOUNDED THE MATE WITH A MUSKET-BALL WHICH BROKE HIS ARM AND WOUNDED TWO MORE OF THE MEN BUT KILLED NOBODY
ON LOOKING UPWARDS I BEHELD HIM HANGING BY HIS BRIDLE TO THE WEATHERCOCK OF THE STEEPLE
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT HE SAID TO HER PRINCESS YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PART IN THE SCHEME WHICH I PROPOSE FOR OUR DELIVERANCE
I MEAN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE COAST WHERE MY HABITATION WAS
SO THAT WHEN I COMPARED THIS PLACE WITH THE DESERT ISLAND FROM WHICH THE ROC HAD BROUGHT ME I FOUND THAT I HAD GAINED NOTHING BY THE CHANGE
BUT BEING WEARY THEY FELL ASLEEP
YOU ARE A DEAD MAN HE WAS ABOUT TO RUSH OUT WHEN THE GIPSY SEIZED HIM WITH A STRONG GRASP
AND IN A WORD ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM EASY
YES SAID PORTIA I AM YOURS AND THIS HOUSE IS YOURS AND WITH THEM I GIVE YOU THIS RING FROM WHICH YOU MUST NEVER PART AND BASSANIO SAYING THAT HE COULD HARDLY ILLUSTRATION
I LOOKED TOWARD MY WINDOWS AND COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE CLOUDS AND SKY
HERE I OFTEN USED TO ROW FOR MY OWN DIVERSION AS WELL AS THAT OF THE QUEEN AND HER LADIES WHO THOUGHT THEMSELVES WELL ENTERTAINED WITH MY SKILL AND AGILITY
IT BLEW VERY HARD ALL NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I LOOKED OUT BEHOLD NO MORE SHIP WAS TO BE SEEN
WE TOOK A KIND LEAVE OF EACH OTHER AND I MADE HIM PROMISE HE WOULD COME TO SEE ME AT MY HOUSE IN REDRIFF
THEN SAID EVANGELIST TO HIM THY SIN IS VERY GREAT YET WILL THE MAN AT THE GATE RECEIVE THEE FOR HE HAS GOOD-WILL FOR MEN
BECAUSE THE TIDE HAVING SET THEM A LITTLE TO THE EAST OF THE OTHER BOAT THEY ROWED UP UNDER SHORE TO COME TO THE SAME PLACE WHERE THE OTHER HAD LANDED AND WHERE THE BOAT LAY
BUT THAT WHICH SURPRISED ME MOST WAS THAT THE SHIP WAS LIFTED OFF IN THE NIGHT FROM THE SAND WHERE SHE LAY BY THE SWELLING OF THE TIDE AND WAS DRIVEN UP ALMOST AS FAR AS THE ROCK WHICH I AT FIRST MENTIONED WHERE I HAD BEEN SO BRUISED BY THE WAVE DASHING ME AGAINST IT
THE UNFORTUNATE JEWESS WAS CONDUCTED TO A BLACK CHAIR PLACED NEAR THE PILE
THE GENIE THEN RETURNED AND CARRIED HIM TO HIS OWN HOME
SHE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY IN PREPARING THE SUPPER
IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER FOR SOME REASONS TO TROUBLE THE READER WITH THE PARTICULARS OF OUR ADVENTURES IN THOSE SEAS
I WILL PROCLAIM THEE A COWARD IN EVERY COURT IN EUROPE UNLESS THOU DO BATTLE WITHOUT FARTHER DELAY DOG OF A SAXON SAID THE TEMPLAR TAKE THY LANCE AND PREPARE FOR THE DEATH THOU HAST DRAWN UPON THEE AT ONCE EACH CHAMPION TOOK HIS PLACE THE TRUMPETS SOUNDED AND THE KNIGHTS CHARGED EACH OTHER IN FULL CAREER
AND IN HIS ABSENCE AS THERE WAS NO OTHER BIDDER THE INFAMOUS GLOSSIN WAS DECLARED TO BE THE LAWFUL PURCHASER AND A NEW LAIRD OF ELLANGOWAN
HE WAS MET BY SIX OR SEVEN MEN-AT-ARMS WHO RAN AGAINST HIM WITH THEIR LANCES AT FULL CAREER
AS SOON AS MY PATRON SAW ME AH POOR SINDBAD EXCLAIMED HE I WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE TO KNOW WHAT WAS BECOME OF YOU
BUT CONCLUDE THEY WERE ALL LOST
BUT I CANNOT I WILL NOT LONGER ABIDE WITH THEE STAY YET A MOMENT SAID ULRICA
AND IF HIS MAJESTY PLEASED THEY WOULD UNDERTAKE TO BRING IT WITH ONLY FIVE HORSES
NO NOT I SAID THE OTHER BECAUSE I HAVE LAID MY HAND TO THE PLOW
BUT HERE I HAD LIKE TO HAVE DIPPED ALL MY CARGO INTO THE SEA AGAIN
AND SO HE DID SAYING GREAT BEELZEBUB THE CAPTAIN OF THIS FIEND DESIGN'D MY RUIN
THE SAID MAN-MOUNTAIN SHALL CONFINE HIS WALKS TO OUR PRINCIPAL HIGH ROADS AND NOT OFFER TO WALK OR LIE DOWN IN A MEADOW OR FIELD OF CORN
ALSO INDIAN CANES AND EXCELLENT CAMPHIRE
AND FRONT-DE-BOEUF COULD HEAR THE CRASH OF THE PONDEROUS KEY AS SHE LOCKED AND DOUBLE-LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
HE CAME AT LAST TO THE SQUARE BEFORE ALADDIN'S PALACE
BUT I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF FULLY OF THIS TILL I SHOULD GO DOWN TO THE SHORE AGAIN AND SEE THIS PRINT OF A FOOT AND MEASURE IT BY MY OWN AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SIMILITUDE OR FITNESS THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED IT WAS MY OWN FOOT
AND THUS HE WAS CLOTHED FOR THE PRESENT TOLERABLY WELL AND WAS MIGHTY WELL PLEASED TO SEE HIMSELF ALMOST AS WELL CLOTHED AS HIS MASTER
BUT DAY HAD SCARCELY APPEARED WHEN WE PERCEIVED OUR CRUEL ENEMY ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OTHERS ALMOST OF THE SAME SIZE LEADING HIM
AND THAT I MIGHT DO WELL FOR HIM AND YET BE PERFECTLY EASY MYSELF I MADE A LITTLE TENT FOR HIM IN THE VACANT PLACE BETWEEN MY TWO FORTIFICATIONS IN THE INSIDE OF THE LAST AND IN THE OUTSIDE OF THE FIRST
AND BY WHAT SECRET DIFFERENT SPRINGS ARE THE AFFECTIONS HURRIED ABOUT AS DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT
AND WHEN I LAY DOWN TO REST AT NIGHT HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN WITH ME HOLDING STILL FAST ABOUT MY NECK
WHEN TURNING MY HEAD THAT WAY AS WELL AS THE PEGS AND STRINGS WOULD PERMIT ME I SAW A STAGE ERECTED ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF FROM THE GROUND CAPABLE OF HOLDING FOUR OF THE INHABITANTS WITH TWO OR THREE LADDERS TO MOUNT IT
THE OTHER TWO ASSES HE LOADED WITH BAGS OF GOLD COVERING THEM WITH WOOD ALSO AS BEFORE
THE POOR OLD MAN ON LEARNING HIS DAUGHTER'S TERRIBLE CONDITION WAS QUITE OVERCOME
BUT THERE IS NO HARM DONE
GREAT WAS THE ALARM AND CONFUSION THE NEXT MORNING WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SMUGGLER HAD ESCAPED FROM PRISON
3DLY WHAT LITTLE WIND THERE WAS BLEW ME TOWARDS THE LAND
AND WAS TURNED BY THE FORCE OF THE WAVES AND THE WINDS ALMOST BOTTOM UPWARD AGAINST A HIGH RIDGE OF BEACHY ROUGH SAND BUT NO WATER ABOUT HER
AND AFTER HAVING EXHORTED ALADDIN TO RENDER HIMSELF WORTHY OF HIS UNCLE'S FAVOR SERVED UP SUPPER AT WHICH THEY TALKED OF SEVERAL INDIFFERENT MATTERS
BUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH TO LOAD HER I AGREED TO TAKE WITH ME SEVERAL MERCHANTS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS WITH THEIR MERCHANDISE
THE HELM WAS HARD-A-WEATHER
THAT IT WAS NO LIVING CREATURE AS THEY AT FIRST APPREHENDED FOR IT LAY ON THE GRASS WITHOUT MOTION
BE THAT AS IT WILL I FOUND MYSELF SUDDENLY AWAKENED WITH A VIOLENT PULL UPON THE RING WHICH WAS FASTENED AT THE TOP OF MY BOX FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF CARRIAGE
AY TROTH I AM SAID HE
AND I BEG THAT THE PRIVATE DOOR MAY BE OPENED AT THE FIRST KNOCK WHEN ALADDIN WAS OUT OF THE PALACE HE LOOKED AROUND HIM ON ALL SIDES AND PERCEIVING A PEASANT GOING INTO THE COUNTRY HASTENED AFTER HIM
THOUGH AT THAT DISTANCE IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASILY HEARD AND BEING OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SMOKE TOO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO MAKE OF IT
I MAINTAIN MY INNOCENCE
AND WHEN I HAD GONE ABOUT FOUR LEAGUES TO THE NORTHWARD THE WIND BEING AT SOUTHEAST AT SIX IN THE EVENING I DESCRIED A SMALL ISLAND ABOUT HALF A LEAGUE TO THE NORTHWEST
I WILL BORROW A SMALL MEASURE AND MEASURE IT WHILE YOU DIG THE HOLE AWAY THE WIFE RAN TO HER BROTHER-IN-LAW CASSIM WHO LIVED JUST BY AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HIS WIFE DESIRED HER TO LEND HER A MEASURE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
OUR VESSEL BEING COME TO A PORT ON THE MAINLAND IN THE INDIES WE TOUCHED THERE AND NOT BEING WILLING TO VENTURE BY SEA TO BUSSORAH I LANDED MY PROPORTION OF THE IVORY RESOLVING TO PROCEED ON MY JOURNEY BY LAND
THE GENIE HELPED HIM TO DRESS AND WHEN HE HAD DONE TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS OWN CHAMBER WHERE HE ASKED HIM IF HE HAD ANY OTHER COMMANDS
AND HE AT ONCE GAVE ORDERS TO COLLECT WHAT FORCE THEY COULD
SHE PRAYED THAT GOD MIGHT BLESS THEIR UNION AND AS SHE ROSE TO LEAVE SHE HANDED ROWENA A CASKET FILLED WITH MOST PRECIOUS JEWELS
ALL THIS WHILE I ATE NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS JUST NECESSARY TO SUPPORT NATURE
HE TOLD THEM HE MUST OBEY
IN THIS TERRIBLE AGITATION OF MIND I COULD NOT FORBEAR THINKING OF LILLIPUT WHOSE INHABITANTS LOOKED UPON ME AS THE GREATEST PRODIGY THAT EVER APPEARED IN THE WORLD
NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE HOW MANY VARIOUS SHAPES MY AFFRIGHTED IMAGINATION REPRESENTED THINGS TO ME IN HOW MANY WILD IDEAS WERE FOUND EVERY MOMENT IN MY FANCY AND WHAT STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE WHIMSIES CAME INTO MY THOUGHTS BY THE WAY
THUS WAS ALADDIN DELIVERED FROM THE PERSECUTION OF THE TWO BROTHERS WHO WERE MAGICIANS
FOR THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE DONE BUT LET ONE OF THE CREW PUT HIS FINGER INTO THE RING AND TAKE THE BOX OUT OF THE SEA INTO THE SHIP AND SO INTO THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN
PERHAPS MANY TRAVELLERS HAVE NOT BEEN UNDER GREATER DIFFICULTIES AND DISTRESS THAN I WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO SEE MY BOX DASHED TO PIECES OR AT LEAST OVERSET BY THE FIRST VIOLENT BLAST OR RISING WAVE
FOR HE HAD ALREADY INFORMED ME HOW THE SEAMEN DISPOSED OF MY CLOSET
HE THEN MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY TO TOWN
AND I FOUND THAT THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT IT
AND ONE PARTICULAR EFFECT OF MY COGITATIONS ON THIS OCCASION I CANNOT OMIT
BUT WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY COULD NOT PREVAIL OBSTINATE WENT RAILING BACK BUT PLIABLE CAME WITH ME A LITTLE WAY
THOU HAST THYSELF DECIDED THINE OWN FATE
THE SEAMEN WERE ALL PROVIDED WITH CORDAGE WHICH I HAD BEFOREHAND TWISTED TO A SUFFICIENT STRENGTH
WELL SAYS THE CAPTAIN I MUST GO AND TELL THE GOVERNOR WHAT YOU SAY AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO BRING HIM TO CONSENT TO IT SO HE BROUGHT ME AN ACCOUNT OF THE TEMPER HE FOUND THEM IN AND THAT HE VERILY BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE FAITHFUL
IN SHORT I GAVE MYSELF UP AS LOST FOR THE LION WAS NOW UPON HIS HIND LEGS JUST IN THE ACT OF SEIZING ME
AND IT WAS INDEED A DISMAL PLACE ESPECIALLY TO MEN IN THEIR CONDITION
I CALLED HIM SO FOR THE MEMORY OF THE TIME
I HAVE MANY TIMES THOUGHT OF YOU
BUT WHAT MOST SURPRISES ME IS THAT A HALL OF THIS MAGNIFICENCE SHOULD BE LEFT WITH ONE OF ITS WINDOWS INCOMPLETE AND UNFINISHED SIRE ANSWERED ALADDIN THE OMISSION WAS BY DESIGN SINCE I WISHED THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE GLORY OF FINISHING THIS HALL I TAKE YOUR INTENTION KINDLY SAID THE SULTAN AND WILL GIVE ORDERS ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SULTAN HAD FINISHED THIS MAGNIFICENT ENTERTAINMENT PROVIDED FOR HIM AND FOR HIS COURT BY ALADDIN HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE JEWELLERS AND GOLDSMITHS ATTENDED
BUT I BESEECH YOU MOST HUMBLY TO CONSIDER WHAT I HAVE UNDERGONE
OUTSIDE THE SHOUTS OF THE SMUGGLERS AND THE MOB RESOUNDED FAR AND WIDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE KEEPER HAD HIMSELF ESCAPED AND LEFT HIS PRISONERS TO PERISH IN THE FLAMES
THE NAME OF BROWN WILL CONSEQUENTLY BE DROPPED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE STORY AND OUR HERO WILL BE CALLED BY HIS PROPER APPELLATION--BERTRAM
AND THE YOUTH WAS READY TO ANSWER WHEN ANY ONE PRESENTED ITSELF CRYING OUT HERE IS A FINER HOUSE UNCLE THAN ANY WE HAVE YET SEEN BY THIS ARTIFICE THE CUNNING MAGICIAN LED ALADDIN SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY
THE APOTHECARY INQUIRED WHO WAS ILL
NO SAID HOPEFUL YOU SHALL NOT GO FIRST
THIS GAVE HIM A HIGHER OPINION OF ALADDIN WHO TOOK SUCH CARE OF HIS MOTHER AND MADE HER SHARE HIS WEALTH AND HONORS
SAY THIS TO THY LORD SHOULD HE CHANCE TO INQUIRE AFTER THE FATE OF HER WHOSE LIFE HE SAVED SHE THEN HASTENED TO BID ROWENA ADIEU AND GLIDED FROM THE APARTMENT
AS FOR CASSIM'S WAREHOUSE HE INTRUSTED IT ENTIRELY TO THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS ELDEST SON
FOR I WHOSE ONLY AFFLICTION WAS THAT I SEEMED BANISHED FROM HUMAN SOCIETY THAT I WAS ALONE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE BOUNDLESS OCEAN CUT OFF FROM MANKIND AND CONDEMNED TO WHAT I CALL SILENT LIFE
I MUST OPEN THE DOOR BROWN STOOD BEFORE HER AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND HE AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE SAME GIPSY WOMAN WHOM HE HAD MET IN THE INN A FEW DAYS BEFORE
IN A FEW MINUTES I CAME TO MYSELF AND HE CARRIED ME SAFE TO MY LITTLE NURSE WHO BY THIS TIME HAD RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE SHE LEFT ME AND WAS IN CRUEL AGONIES WHEN I DID NOT APPEAR NOR ANSWER WHEN SHE CALLED
BUT HOLDING UP THE CHESTS WITH ALL MY MIGHT I STOOD IN THAT MANNER NEAR HALF AN HOUR IN WHICH TIME THE RISING OF THE WATER BROUGHT ME A LITTLE MORE UPON A LEVEL
PLINY
I WOULD SHE WERE DEAD AT MY FEET AND THE JEWELS IN HER EAR HE CRIED
THEREFORE IT IS THAT THE FIRST OF THESE SO SUDDENLY FELL INTO AMITY AND THAT DISTANCE IS SO CONTINUED BETWEEN THE SECOND
THE SEVEN MEN CAME ON SHORE AND THE THREE WHO REMAINED IN THE BOAT PUT HER OFF TO A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE AND CAME TO AN ANCHOR TO WAIT FOR THEM
THE FIFTH VOYAGE ALL THE TROUBLES AND CALAMITIES I HAD UNDERGONE COULD NOT CURE ME OF MY INCLINATION TO MAKE NEW VOYAGES
I WILL TELL YOU WHO HE IS AND WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
AND THE YOUNG MAN FINDING HIMSELF DISINHERITED HAD ADOPTED THE PROFESSION OF A CHAMPION OF THE CROSS AND SAILED AWAY TO PALESTINE WITH THE ARMY OF THE CRUSADERS
AND I HAVE THOUGHT OF A PLAN TO PAY EVERYTHING I OWE IF YOU WILL BUT HELP ME SAY WHAT I CAN DO AND IT SHALL BE DONE ANSWERED HIS FRIEND
TO THESE IN THE MORNING I SENT THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS TO ENTER INTO A PARLEY WITH THEM
SINDBAD HERE FINISHED THE RELATION OF HIS SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE AND THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO HINDBAD WELL FRIEND SAID HE DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANY PERSON THAT SUFFERED SO MUCH AS I HAVE DONE
I HAD THE TALLOW OF THREE HUNDRED COWS FOR GREASING MY BOAT AND OTHER USES
AT LENGTH I SPIED A LITTLE COVE ON THE RIGHT SHORE OF THE CREEK TO WHICH WITH GREAT PAIN AND DIFFICULTY I GUIDED MY RAFT AND AT LAST GOT SO NEAR THAT REACHING GROUND WITH MY OAR I COULD THRUST HER DIRECTLY IN
BUT IN VAIN SINCE HIS CRIES COULD NOT BE HEARD
ALL THIS SEEMED INCONSISTENT WITH THE THING ITSELF AND WITH ALL THE NOTIONS WE USUALLY ENTERTAIN OF THE SUBTLETY OF THE DEVIL
FOR SHE IS ALL YOURS AND SO ARE WE AND ALL THAT BELONG TO HER I CAST MY EYES TO THE SHIP AND THERE SHE RODE WITHIN LITTLE MORE THAN HALF A MILE OF THE SHORE
MY HABITATION WAS A TENT UNDER THE SIDE OF A ROCK SURROUNDED WITH A STRONG PALE OF POSTS AND CABLES
THEN DO WHAT I BID YE FOR IF HE WAS LEFT TO HIS ILL WISHERS HE WOULD BE A BLOODY CORPSE ERE MORN AND SHE THEN DISAPPEARED INTO THE WOOD
THIS WAS A FAIR PROPOSAL IT MUST BE CONFESSED HAD IT BEEN MADE TO ANY ONE THAT HAD NOT HAD A SETTLEMENT AND A PLANTATION OF HIS OWN TO LOOK AFTER WHICH WAS IN A FAIR WAY OF COMING TO BE VERY CONSIDERABLE AND WITH A GOOD STOCK UPON IT
BUT THE QUEEN HAD BEFORE CONTRIVED ANOTHER PROJECT
THE SULTAN'S AMAZEMENT AND SURPRISE WERE INEXPRESSIBLE WHEN HE SAW SO MANY LARGE BEAUTIFUL AND VALUABLE JEWELS COLLECTED IN THE DISH
AMONGST THE RANKS OF THE DISINHERITED KNIGHT WAS A CHAMPION IN BLACK ARMOUR MOUNTED ON A BLACK HORSE WHOSE SHIELD BORE NO DEVICE OF ANY KIND
ALSO I GAVE THEM THE BAG OF PEAS WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD BROUGHT ME TO EAT AND BADE THEM BE SURE TO SOW AND INCREASE THEM
AND THOSE IN OUR KEEPING THOUGH THEY HEARD IT WELL ENOUGH YET DURST GIVE NO ANSWER TO THEM
BUT I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT BEFORE THE PRINCIPAL PERSON BEGAN HIS ORATION HE CRIED OUT THREE TIMES LANGRO DEHUL SAN THESE WORDS AND THE FORMER WERE AFTERWARDS REPEATED AND EXPLAINED TO ME WHEREUPON IMMEDIATELY ABOUT FIFTY OF THE INHABITANTS CAME AND CUT THE STRINGS THAT FASTENED THE LEFT SIDE OF MY HEAD WHICH GAVE ME THE LIBERTY OF TURNING IT TO THE RIGHT AND OF OBSERVING THE PERSON AND GESTURE OF HIM THAT WAS TO SPEAK
BUT NOW I FOUND THAT THEY HAD STATED NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
BUT WHO WAS TO FILL THE PLACE ON THE PRESENT OCCASION NO ONE WAS PREPARED TO GUESS
THEREFORE BEING SURE THAT THEY COULD NOT ARRIVE IN TIME TO PURSUE ME I WENT ON TILL NIGHT WHEN I STOPPED TO REST A LITTLE AND TO EAT SOME OF THE PROVISIONS I HAD SECURED
I WAS NOT SURPRISED THAT HE BELIEVING ME TO BE DEAD DID NOT RECOGNIZE ME
PROUD TEMPLAR SAID IVANHOE HAST THOU FORGOTTEN THAT TWICE DIDST THOU FALL BEFORE THIS LANCE
THEN GANYMEDE CAME IN AND SAID TO THE DUKE IF I BRING IN YOUR DAUGHTER ROSALIND WILL YOU GIVE HER TO ORLANDO HERE THAT I WOULD SAID THE DUKE IF I HAD ALL KINGDOMS TO GIVE WITH HER AND YOU SAY YOU WILL HAVE HER WHEN I BRING HER SHE SAID TO ORLANDO
HE DESIRED I WOULD STAND LIKE A COLOSSUS FROM THE PAINTING BY ARTHUR RACKHAM THESE PEOPLE ARE MOST EXCELLENT MATHEMATICIANS AND ARRIVED TO A GREAT PERFECTION IN MECHANICS BY THE COUNTENANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE EMPEROR WHO IS A RENOWNED PATRON OF LEARNING
AND HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST I NEITHER MADE THIS SO UNWIELDY NOR LOADED IT SO HARD BUT YET I BROUGHT AWAY SEVERAL THINGS VERY USEFUL TO ME
AS FIRST IN THE CARPENTER'S STORES I FOUND TWO OR THREE BAGS FULL OF NAILS AND SPIKES A GREAT SCREWJACK A DOZEN OR TWO OF HATCHETS AND ABOVE ALL THAT MOST USEFUL THING CALLED A GRINDSTONE
BASSANIO IN HIS GRATITUDE TO THE CLEVER LAWYER WAS INDUCED TO PART WITH THE RING HIS WIFE HAD GIVEN HIM AND WITH WHICH HE HAD PROMISED NEVER TO PART AND WHEN ON HIS RETURN TO BELMONT HE CONFESSED AS MUCH TO PORTIA SHE SEEMED VERY ANGRY AND VOWED SHE WOULD NOT BE FRIENDS WITH HIM UNTIL SHE HAD HER RING AGAIN
THESE ARTICLES WERE BROUGHT TO ME BY SKYRESH BOLGOLAM IN PERSON ATTENDED BY TWO UNDER-SECRETARIES AND SEVERAL PERSONS OF DISTINCTION
BUT THE FIRST INCONVENIENCE WAS IT WAS UP HILL TOWARDS THE CREEK
AND CAUSING THE DOOR TO OPEN IN THE INSIDE I BARRED IT UP IN THE NIGHT TAKING IN MY LADDERS TOO
HOT AND FIERCE WAS THE COMBAT THAT ENSUED BETWEEN THEM
WE KNEW NOTHING WHERE WE WERE OR UPON WHAT LAND IT WAS WE WERE DRIVEN
HER LONG DISHEVELLED GRAY HAIR FLEW BACK FROM HER UNCOVERED HEAD WHILE THE DELIGHT OF GRATIFIED VENGEANCE CONTENDED IN HER EYES WITH THE FIRE OF INSANITY
THE SULTAN HEARKENED TO THIS DISCOURSE WITHOUT SHOWING THE LEAST ANGER
SO THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO COME AT THEM IN THE BOAT
THOU ART NOT WORTH TO ME--NO NOT THE TAKING OFF THE GROUND
I HAD NOW BEEN TWO YEARS IN THE COUNTRY
I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU RICHES TO THIS I REPLIED
WELL TOWARDS EVENING THE GIANT GOES DOWN INTO THE DUNGEON AGAIN TO SEE IF HIS PRISONERS HAD TAKEN HIS COUNSEL
WHEN THE POOR HALF-CRACKED DOMINIE HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE EMPLOYED AS COLONEL MANNERING'S LIBRARIAN HIS JOY KNEW NO BOUNDS
THE MAN SAID I WAS ONCE A FAIR AND FLOURISHING PROFESSOR BOTH IN MINE OWN EYES AND ALSO IN THE EYES OF OTHERS
AS I WAS ON THE ROAD OBSERVING THE LITTLENESS OF THE HOUSES THE TREES THE CATTLE AND THE PEOPLE I BEGAN TO THINK MYSELF IN LILLIPUT
I HAD NOT EVEN A MOMENT FOR REFLECTION
IT IS VANISHED
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE JUNIOR CLASSICS V5 BY EDITED BY WILLIAM PATTEN
THE NEXT DAY THE MAGICIAN CALLED FOR THE TWELVE LAMPS PAID THE MAN HIS FULL PRICE PUT THEM INTO A BASKET HANGING ON HIS ARM AND WENT DIRECTLY TO ALADDIN'S PALACE
THE BOATMAN READILY ACCEDED TO HIS WISHES AND LANDED HIM ON THE BEACH BENEATH THE RUINS
AND ENTERTAINED BUT A POOR OPINION OF HER WOULD-BE LOVER WHOSE PRETENSIONS FOR HER HAND SHE HAD RECEIVED WITH MARKED DISDAIN
DINMONT ON HIS PART THEN RELATED HOW HE HAD COME TO KNOW OF BERTRAM'S BEING LOCKED UP
FOR JUST AS I WAS GOING IN A FIT OF DESPERATION TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE SEA I PERCEIVED A SHIP IN THE DISTANCE
BEGONE I PRAY THEE
AND FIRST OF ALL I GAVE HIM A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS WHICH I HAD OUT OF THE POOR GUNNER'S CHEST I MENTIONED WHICH I FOUND IN THE WRECK AND WHICH WITH A LITTLE ALTERATION FITTED HIM VERY WELL
DIRCK HATTERAICK SHE SAID YOU AND I WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN UNTIL WE ARE BEFORE THE JUDGMENT-SEAT--WILL YE DARE DENY IT AND AS HATTERAICK REFUSED TO OPEN HIS LIPS SHE ADDED
THERE HE SET THE PRINCE TO WORK MAKING HIM REMOVE THOUSANDS OF HEAVY LOGS OF TIMBER AND PILE THEM UP
HAVING THUS HEARD THE SIGNAL PLAINLY I LAID ME DOWN
THE GREAT GATE FRONTING TO THE NORTH WAS ABOUT FOUR FEET HIGH AND ALMOST TWO FEET WIDE THROUGH WHICH I COULD EASILY CREEP
OBSERVING THAT HE LOOKED ON MY JEWELS WITH PLEASURE AND VIEWED THE MOST REMARKABLE AMONG THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER I FELL PROSTRATE AT HIS FEET AND TOOK THE LIBERTY TO SAY TO HIM SIRE NOT ONLY MY PERSON IS AT YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT THE CARGO OF THE RAFT AND I WOULD BEG OF YOU TO DISPOSE OF IT AS YOUR OWN HE ANSWERED ME WITH A SMILE SINDBAD I WILL TAKE NOTHING OF YOURS
YOU SAY TRUTH
IN A MOMENT BROWN WHO WAS BOTH STRONG AND ACTIVE CAME TO THE RESCUE
OH REPLIED HE YOU MUST HAVE ME DO SOMETHING AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE OR AGAINST MY HONOR GOD FORBID SAID MORGIANA PUTTING ANOTHER PIECE OF GOLD INTO HIS HAND THAT I SHOULD ASK ANYTHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO YOUR HONOR
ONE OF HER WOMEN TOLD HER IT WAS A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ABOUT THE HOLY WOMAN TO BE CURED OF DISEASES BY THE IMPOSITION OF HER HANDS
THIS WAS A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO US FOR NOW WE WERE AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO AS OUR SEIZING THOSE SEVEN MEN ON SHORE WOULD BE NO ADVANTAGE TO US IF WE LET THE BOAT ESCAPE
THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN WAS NOT QUITE BLACK BUT VERY TAWNY
AS THE PRISON CLOCK TOLLED TEN GLOSSIN SLIPPED OFF HIS SHOES AND SILENTLY FOLLOWED MAC-GUFFOG TO THE SMUGGLER'S ROOM
I WENT TO IT AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY MORE AND TO OBSERVE IF IT MIGHT NOT BE MY FANCY
AND LO AS THEY ENTERED THEY WERE TRANSFIGURED AND THEY HAD RAIMENT PUT ON THAT SHONE LIKE GOLD
AS WE ADVANCED WE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A VAST PILE OF BUILDING AND MADE TOWARD IT
I HAD NO COMPETITOR NONE TO DISPUTE SOVEREIGNTY OR COMMAND WITH ME
BUT I CANNOT MARRY THE PRINCESS MY DAUGHTER FOR THREE MONTHS
NEVER MIND WHY ANSWERED THE DUKE YOU ARE BANISHED
NOW I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT THESE TWO MEN WENT IN AT THE GATE
I WILL GO AGAIN TOMORROW
AND AGAIN BECAUSE THINGS TO COME AND CARNAL SENSE ARE SUCH STRANGERS ONE TO ANOTHER
THEN IN NOBLE WORDS SHE BADE SHYLOCK HAVE MERCY
LET US CLOSE WITH THEM SAID THE KNIGHT AND HE RODE STRAIGHT TO THE THICKET
IT HAD FOUR STEPS AND A STONE TO CROSS OVER WHEN YOU COME TO THE UPPERMOST
OUR ENDEAVORS HAD NO EFFECT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO CLIMB THIS STILE BECAUSE EVERY STEP WAS SIX FEET HIGH AND THE UPPER STONE ABOUT TWENTY
BERTRAM AGAIN TOLD HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD
ACCORDINGLY WHEN MAC-GUFFOG THE KEEPER APPEARED AT NIGHT TIME HE GAVE HIM SOME GOLD PIECES AND SO OBTAINED HIS CONSENT TO AN INTERVIEW WITH HIS FELLOW PRISONER
AND THOU BRAVE LOCKSLEY CALL ME NO LONGER LOCKSLEY MY LIEGE SAID THE OUTLAW
HIS MOTHER PERCEIVED HIM TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL AND MELANCHOLY THAN USUAL AND ASKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE HIM SO OR IF HE WAS ILL
SO THAT THERE WERE TWELVE IN ALL BESIDES FIVE WE KEPT PRISONERS IN THE CAVE FOR HOSTAGES
AND WHEN WE WERE RETURNED MY MASTER THUS ADDRESSED ME
WE SAILED WITH THE FIRST FAIR WIND AND AFTER A LONG NAVIGATION THE FIRST PLACE WE TOUCHED AT WAS A DESERT ISLAND WHERE WE FOUND AN EGG OF A ROC EQUAL IN SIZE TO THAT I FORMERLY MENTIONED
THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WITHIN
HE ASKED MORGIANA WHO OPENED THE DOOR THE REASON OF IT
AND THE NEXT RUN I TOOK I GOT TO THE MAINLAND
I HANDED HIM THE CALABASH AND THE LIQUOR PLEASING HIS PALATE HE DRANK IT OFF
THE MERCHANTS HAD THROWN THEIR PIECES OF MEAT INTO THE VALLEY FOR SEVERAL DAYS
IT WAS IN VAIN TO SIT STILL AND WISH FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE HAD
BUT BLESSED MICHAEL HELPED ME AND I BY DINT OF SWORD DID QUICKLY MAKE HIM FLY
THEN CHRISTIAN BEGAN TO GIRD UP HIS LOINS AND ADDRESS HIMSELF TO HIS JOURNEY
AT EVERY BUILDING HE CAME TO HE ASKED ALADDIN IF HE DID NOT THINK IT FINE
AND MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH SOME SHRUBS PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS--"OPEN SESAME AS SOON AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS HAD THUS SPOKEN A DOOR OPENED IN THE ROCK
BECAUSE I AM CONFIDENT IT WOULD HAVE SENSIBLY TOUCHED ME BY BRINGING FORMER PASSAGES INTO MY MIND WHICH I WOULD RATHER HAVE FORGOT
I FOUND ALSO THAT THE ISLAND I WAS IN WAS BARREN AND AS I SAW GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE UNINHABITED EXCEPT BY WILD BEASTS OF WHOM HOWEVER I SAW NONE
THEN SAID EVANGELIST IF THIS BE THY CONDITION WHY STANDEST THOU STILL
ON READING IT OVER HE CAME SOMEHOW TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MISS MANNERING MEANT THE OPPOSITE OF ALL SHE HAD WRITTEN AND IN THIS BELIEF HE SET SAIL AT ONCE FOR KIPPLETRINGAN
AND EACH OF THEM BEING SATISFIED WITH THE DIAMONDS THAT HAD FALLEN TO HIS LOT WE LEFT THE PLACE THE NEXT MORNING AND TRAVELLED NEAR HIGH MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE WERE SERPENTS OF A PRODIGIOUS LENGTH WHICH WE HAD THE GOOD-FORTUNE TO ESCAPE
CHAINS AND SHACKLES WHICH HAD BEEN THE PORTION OF FORMER CAPTIVES HUNG RUSTED ON THE GLOOMY WALLS AND IN THE RINGS OF ONE OF THOSE SETS OF FETTERS THERE REMAINED THE MOULDERING BONES OF SOME UNHAPPY PRISONER WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO PERISH THERE IN OTHER DAYS
THEY WERE THEREFORE HERE IN EVIL CASE AND WERE FAR FROM FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCE
BUT NOW A NEW AND FIERCE ATTACK WAS HEARD AT THE OUTER GATE
OUR SHIP WAS ABOUT 120 TONS BURDEN CARRIED SIX GUNS AND FOURTEEN MEN BESIDES THE MASTER HIS BOY AND MYSELF
THE EMPEROR HAD A MIND ONE DAY TO ENTERTAIN ME WITH SEVERAL OF THE COUNTRY SHOWS WHEREIN THEY EXCEED ALL NATIONS I HAVE KNOWN BOTH FOR DEXTERITY AND MAGNIFICENCE
WHEN COLONEL MANNERING AFTER THE DEATH OF MR BERTRAM LEFT ELLANGOWAN WITH THE INTENTION OF COMING BACK TO BUY THE PROPERTY HE TRAVELLED SOME DISTANCE AND AFTER A WHILE CAME TO A POST-TOWN WHERE HE EXPECTED SOME LETTERS
I HAD BEEN NOW THIRTEEN DAYS ON SHORE AND HAD BEEN ELEVEN TIMES ON BOARD THE SHIP IN WHICH TIME I HAD BROUGHT AWAY ALL THAT ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD WELL BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE TO BRING
PRODIGIOUS
AND WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PERSUADED EVEN THE EMPRESS HERSELF TO LET ME HOLD HER IN HER CLOSE CHAIR WITHIN TWO YARDS OF THE STAGE FROM WHENCE SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FULL VIEW OF THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE
NOW I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT WHEN OBSTINATE WAS GONE BACK CHRISTIAN AND PLIABLE WENT TALKING OVER THE PLAIN
THE SERVANTS BROUGHT HIM INTO A GREAT HALL WHERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAT ROUND A TABLE COVERED WITH ALL SORTS OF SAVORY DISHES
THE COLONEL WAS HOWEVER AWAY FROM HOME AT THE TIME AND THE FRIENDLESS AND UNFORTUNATE BERTRAM WAS REMOVED TO PRISON PENDING MANNERING'S RETURN
I AT ONCE KNEW THE CAPTAIN AND I WENT AND ASKED HIM FOR MY BALES
EXAMINING ALL THE JARS ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE FOUND THAT ALL HIS GANG WERE DEAD
CONTENTS PREFACE ARABIAN NIGHTS ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES THE STORY OF ALADDIN
DANIEL DEFOE WHO WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AS SWIFT AND LIVED AT THE SAME TIME SAID SWIFT WAS A WALKING INDEX OF ALL BOOKS
BUT TO ALL OF THEM PORTIA HAD BUT ONE REPLY
BUT MY GOOD STAR WOULD HAVE IT THAT HE APPEARED PLEASED WITH MY VOICE AND GESTURES AND BEGAN TO LOOK UPON ME AS A CURIOSITY MUCH WONDERING TO HEAR ME PRONOUNCE ARTICULATE WORDS ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
ON MY RIGHT HAND WAS THE PIECE OF WATER BEFORE MENTIONED AND ON MY LEFT A DEEP PRECIPICE SAID TO HAVE AS I HAVE SINCE LEARNED A RECEPTACLE AT THE BOTTOM FOR VENOMOUS CREATURES
ALADDIN BEING SUDDENLY ENVELOPED IN DARKNESS CRIED AND CALLED OUT TO HIS UNCLE TO TELL HIM HE WAS READY TO GIVE HIM THE LAMP
WE MUST BURY HIM AS IF HE HAD DIED A NATURAL DEATH
THERE WERE TWO VERY GOOD FOWLING-PIECES IN THE GREAT CABIN AND TWO PISTOLS
HOWEVER WE COMMITTED OUR SOULS TO GOD IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER
BEING GRANTED PERMISSION TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER FATHER SHE HASTILY WROTE A FEW LINES IN HEBREW TO HIM IMPLORING HIM TO SEEK OUT WILFRED THE SON OF CEDRIC AND LET HIM KNOW THAT SHE WAS IN SORE NEED OF A CHAMPION
A HUNDRED OF WHITE CLOTH THE FINEST OF CAIRO SUEZ AND ALEXANDRIA
YOU PRETEND TO BE MISERABLY POOR AND YET YOU MEASURE GOLD
BUT WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE GROUND I SPEEDILY UNTIED THE KNOT AND HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN THE ROC HAVING TAKEN UP A SERPENT OF MONSTROUS LENGTH IN HER BILL FLEW AWAY
WHEN THE PONDEROUS CASTLE BELL HAD TOLLED THE POINT OF NOON THE JEWESS WAS LED FROM HER SECLUDED CHAMBER INTO THE GREAT HALL IN WHICH THE GRAND MASTER HAD FOR THE TIME ESTABLISHED HIS COURT OF JUSTICE
FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL DIE INSTANTLY
I IMMEDIATELY RAN DOWN THE LADDERS WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION FETCHED MY TWO GUNS FOR THEY WERE BOTH AT THE FOOT OF THE LADDERS AS I OBSERVED BEFORE AND GETTING UP AGAIN WITH THE SAME HASTE TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I CROSSED TOWARDS THE SEA
BERTRAM HAD HOWEVER BEEN SEEN HE SAID A FEW DAYS BEFORE AMONG THE HILLS BY A GIPSY NAMED GABRIEL
SECOND THE TWO PRISONERS OF THE FIRST GANG TO WHOM HAVING THEIR CHARACTER FROM THE CAPTAIN I HAD GIVEN THEIR LIBERTY AND TRUSTED THEM WITH ARMS
SO THEY SPOKE TO HIM AND ASKED HIM NOT TO ATTEMPT SO DANGEROUS AN ADVENTURE
WHEN THE PROFESSOR EXPRESSED ASTONISHMENT SUPPOSING IT TO BE A JEST THE HISTORIAN SAID HE WAS QUITE SERIOUS BUT THAT IF ROBINSON CRUSOE WOULD NOT HELP HIM FOR ANY REASON HE RECOMMENDED GULLIVER'S TRAVELS
THIS FORCED TEARS TO MY EYES AGAIN
I DENY THIS CHARGE
BUT WHEN I REVIVED I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND MYSELF IN AN EXTENSIVE PLAIN ON THE BRINK OF A RIVER WHERE MY RAFT WAS TIED AMONG A GREAT NUMBER OF NEGROES
AFTER THIS I WENT EVERY DAY ON BOARD AND BROUGHT AWAY WHAT I COULD GET
TO PLEAD THAT MANY THINGS WHICH THESE MEN WHOM MAY HEAVEN PARDON HAVE SPOKEN AGAINST ME ARE IMPOSSIBLE WOULD AVAIL ME BUT LITTLE SINCE YOU BELIEVE IN THEIR POSSIBILITY AND STILL LESS WOULD IT ADVANTAGE ME TO EXPLAIN THAT THE PECULIARITIES OF MY DRESS LANGUAGE AND MANNERS ARE THOSE OF MY PEOPLE
THOUGH A WILD LAD WITH LITTLE EDUCATION HE MARRIED A SPLENDID WIFE WHO CHANGED THE EVIL COURSE OF HIS LIFE AND INTERESTED HIM IN RELIGION
WERE YE NOT FRIENDLESS HOUSELESS PENNILESS WHEN I TOOK YE BY THE HAND
WHICH WAS INDEED A PRODIGIOUS LEAP
THEN INDEED HE DID SMILE AND LOOK UPWARD
THE REMOVAL OF THE BODY AND THE LOSS OF SOME OF OUR MONEY PLAINLY SHOW THAT THE MAN WHOM WE KILLED HAD AN ACCOMPLICE
SIRE I COME AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS TO ASK OF YOU THE FULFILMENT OF THE PROMISE YOU MADE TO MY SON THE SULTAN LITTLE THOUGHT THE REQUEST OF ALADDIN'S MOTHER WAS MADE TO HIM IN EARNEST OR THAT HE WOULD HEAR ANY MORE OF THE MATTER
BUT A MORE DANGEROUS ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE SAME GARDEN WHEN MY LITTLE NURSE BELIEVING SHE HAD PUT ME IN A SECURE PLACE WHICH I OFTEN ENTREATED HER TO DO THAT I MIGHT ENJOY MY OWN THOUGHTS AND HAVING LEFT MY BOX AT HOME TO AVOID THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING IT WENT TO ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN WITH HER GOVERNESS AND SOME LADIES OF HER ACQUAINTANCE
AND NOW INSTEAD OF BEING PLEASED HE CONCEIVED A BASE ENVY AT HIS BROTHER'S PROSPERITY
BUT JUST FOR FUN YOU SHALL SIGN A BOND IN WHICH IT SHALL BE AGREED THAT IF YOU DO NOT REPAY ME IN THREE MONTHS TIME THEN I SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO A POUND OF YOUR FLESH TO BE CUT FROM WHAT PART OF YOUR BODY I CHOOSE NO CRIED BASSANIO TO HIS FRIEND YOU SHALL RUN NO SUCH RISK FOR ME WHY FEAR NOT SAID ANTONIO MY SHIPS WILL BE HOME A MONTH BEFORE THE TIME I WILL SIGN THE BOND THUS BASSANIO WAS FURNISHED WITH THE MEANS TO GO TO BELMONT THERE TO WOO THE LOVELY PORTIA
THEY ALL APPEARED VERY PENITENT AND BEGGED HARD FOR THEIR LIVES
GLOSSIN WAS CONFINED IN ANOTHER ROOM HIS MIND STILL TEEMING WITH SCHEMES OF FUTURE DECEIT TO COVER HIS FORMER VILLAINIES
THAT IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DO SO IT WAS MY UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO RESIGN MYSELF ABSOLUTELY AND ENTIRELY TO HIS WILL
I DO NOT EXACTLY RECOLLECT WHETHER IT WAS EASTLAND OR JUGEMANLAND BUT I REMEMBER THAT IN THE MIDST OF A DREARY FOREST I SPIED A TERRIBLE WOLF MAKING AFTER ME WITH ALL THE SPEED OF RAVENOUS WINTER HUNGER
AND THEN IN A MOMENT SHE SAW PLAINLY THE DONKEY-HEADED CLOWN SHE HAD BEEN LOVING AND KNEW HOW FOOLISH SHE HAD BEEN
I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT VACANT APARTMENTS I HAVE THAT YOU MAY MAKE CHOICE OF THAT YOU LIKE BEST THE MAGICIAN FOLLOWED THE PRINCESS AND OF ALL THE APARTMENTS SHE SHOWED HIM MADE CHOICE OF THAT WHICH WAS THE WORST SAYING THAT IT WAS TOO GOOD FOR HIM AND THAT HE ONLY ACCEPTED IT TO PLEASE HER
THE FROG LAY CONCEALED TILL I WAS PUT INTO MY BOAT BUT THEN SEEING A RESTING PLACE CLIMBED UP AND MADE IT TO LEAN SO MUCH ON ONE SIDE THAT I WAS FORCED TO BALANCE IT WITH ALL MY WEIGHT ON THE OTHER TO PREVENT OVERTURNING
INDEED OUR PRESENT CONDITION IS DREADFUL AND DEATH WOULD BE FAR MORE WELCOME TO ME THAN THUS FOR EVER TO ABIDE
AND THOUGH MY MISTRESS HELD HER FAST FOR FEAR SHE MIGHT GIVE A SPRING AND SEIZE ME IN HER TALONS
BUT I THANKED HER AND COULD SPARE NO MORE SO SHE MARCHED OFF
BUT FOUND A NECK OR INLET OF WATER BETWEEN ME AND THE BOAT WHICH WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE BROAD
AND HOW SHE SWORE AN OATH TO KEEP THE SECRET TILL HE WAS ONE-AND-TWENTY AND VOWED THAT IF SHE LIVED TO SEE THE DAY OF HIS RETURN SHE WOULD SET HIM AGAIN IN HIS FATHER'S SEAT THOUGH EVERY STEP WAS ON A DEAD MAN
BUT HE SAID THAT CAN BY NO MEANS BE
AND THAT THEREFORE I HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT CONSIDER OF SOME SAFE RETREAT IN CASE I SHOULD SEE ANY SAVAGES LAND UPON THE SPOT
AND AS HE RAN SOME MOCKED OTHERS THREATENED AND SOME CRIED AFTER HIM TO RETURN
AS I FOUND SOME WEEKS AFTER WHEN I WENT TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE EMPEROR OF BLEFUSCU WHICH IN THE MIDST OF GREAT MISFORTUNES THROUGH THE MALICE OF MY ENEMIES PROVED A VERY HAPPY ADVENTURE TO ME AS I SHALL RELATE IN ITS PROPER PLACE
IT NOW OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE TIME OF OUR DELIVERANCE WAS COME AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MOST EASY THING TO BRING THESE FELLOWS IN TO BE HEARTY IN GETTING POSSESSION OF THE SHIP
HOWEVER WHEN SHE HAD AWHILE SEEN MY BEHAVIOR AND HOW WELL I OBSERVED THE SIGNS HER HUSBAND MADE SHE WAS SOON RECONCILED AND BY DEGREES GREW EXTREMELY TENDER OF ME
THEN WHEN THIS IS DONE ALL WILL BE WELL WITH THEM SO PUCK WENT AND DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND WHEN THE TWO HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT MEETING EACH OTHER PUCK POURED THE JUICE ON LYSANDER'S EYES AND SAID WHEN THOU WAKEST THOU TAKEST TRUE DELIGHT IN THE SIGHT OF THY FORMER LADY'S EYE
REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE AND FOLLOW ME IT WAS IN VAIN THAT HIS SISTER AND HER COMPANION URGED HIM NOT TO GO WITH THE GIPSY
FOR FINDING I DID NOT FOLLOW HIM INTO THE WOOD HE RETURNED APPREHENDING I HAD LOST MY WAY OR MET WITH SOME ACCIDENT
THE MISTRESS SENT HER MAID FOR A SMALL DRAM CUP WHICH HELD ABOUT TWO GALLONS AND FILLED IT WITH DRINK
AND AT THE HOLE OR PLACE WHICH WAS LEFT TO GO IN OR OUT BY THE LADDER I HAD PLACED A KIND OF TRAP-DOOR WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED ON THE OUTSIDE WOULD NOT HAVE OPENED AT ALL BUT WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN AND MADE A GREAT NOISE
NO FURTHER EVIDENCE COULD BE PROCURED OF HER GUILT AND SHE WAS AT LENGTH SET FREE UNDER SENTENCE OF BANISHMENT FROM THE COUNTY
TO WHICH HE ANSWERED THAT DISCOURSING THIS MATTER WITH THE SAILORS WHILE I WAS ASLEEP ONE OF THEM SAID HE HAD OBSERVED THREE EAGLES FLYING TOWARD THE NORTH BUT REMARKED NOTHING OF THEIR BEING LARGER THAN THE USUAL SIZE
HE COULD NOT SLEEP ALL THAT NIGHT AND WENT TO HIM IN THE MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE
GURTH STARTED AS IF ELECTRIFIED AND HASTENED AT ONCE TO PROCURE THEIR MULES FOR THE TRAVELLERS AND TO OPEN THE POSTERN GATE TO LET THEM OUT
FAREWELL THE PRESENT CONSISTED FIRST OF ONE SINGLE RUBY MADE INTO A CUP ABOUT HALF A FOOT HIGH AN INCH THICK AND FILLED WITH ROUND PEARLS OF HALF A DRACHM EACH
AND AS I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS TOLD AND FOUND TRUE BY EXPERIENCE IN MY TRAVELS THAT FLYING OR DISCOVERING FEAR BEFORE A FIERCE ANIMAL IS A CERTAIN WAY TO MAKE IT PURSUE OR ATTACK YOU SO I RESOLVED IN THIS DANGEROUS JUNCTURE TO SHOW NO MANNER OF CONCERN
TWO OF THEM OF WHOM THE CAPTAIN WAS LESS ASSURED THAN ORDINARY I SENT WITH FRIDAY AND ONE OF THE THREE DELIVERED MEN TO MY CAVE WHERE THEY WERE REMOTE ENOUGH AND OUT OF DANGER OF BEING HEARD OR DISCOVERED OR OF FINDING THEIR WAY OUT OF THE WOODS IF THEY COULD HAVE DELIVERED THEMSELVES
BESIDES ON THE BANKS OF THIS RIVER ON EITHER SIDE WERE GREEN TREES THAT BORE ALL MANNER OF FRUIT
WE HAULED OFF UPON THE LANYARD OF THE WHIP-STAFF AND HELPED THE MAN AT THE HELM
AND WHAT COURSE TO TAKE FOR MY SECURITY I KNEW NOT
AND HAVING LOADED ONE OF HIS ASSES WITH THEM COVERED THEM OVER WITH WOOD
ON THE NEXT AUDIENCE DAY WHEN ALADDIN'S MOTHER WENT TO THE DIVAN AND PLACED HERSELF IN FRONT OF THE SULTAN AS USUAL THE GRAND VIZIER IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE CHIEF OF THE MACE-BEARERS AND POINTING TO HER BADE HIM BRING HER BEFORE THE SULTAN
I ALSO HEARD THE MEN THEMSELVES THAT THEY SANG WITH A LOUD VOICE SAYING BLESSING HONOUR GLORY AND POWER BE TO HIM THAT SITTETH UPON THE THRONE AND TO THE LAMB FOR EVER AND EVER
BUT IT PLEASED GOD ONCE MORE TO TAKE COMPASSION ON ME AND PUT IT IN MY MIND TO GO TO THE BANK OF THE RIVER WHICH RAN INTO THE GREAT CAVERN
THE NOISE OF OPENING THE WINDOW MADE ALADDIN TURN HIS HEAD THAT WAY AND PERCEIVING THE PRINCESS HE SALUTED HER WITH AN AIR THAT EXPRESSED HIS JOY
WHEN I GAZED TOWARD THE SEA I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT SKY AND WATER
I CANNOT TELL WHETHER I WERE MORE PLEASED OR MORTIFIED TO OBSERVE IN THOSE SOLITARY WALKS THAT THE SMALLER BIRDS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AT ALL AFRAID OF ME BUT WOULD HOP ABOUT WITHIN A YARD'S DISTANCE LOOKING FOR WORMS AND OTHER FOOD WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AND SECURITY AS IF NO CREATURE AT ALL WERE NEAR THEM
SO I CAME HITHER
BUT SAID BASSANIO LET ME CHOOSE AT ONCE FOR AS I AM I LIVE UPON THE RACK THEN PORTIA BADE HER SERVANTS TO BRING MUSIC AND PLAY WHILE HER GALLANT LOVER MADE HIS CHOICE
WHEREAS WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY MAKE OUR VOYAGE TO THE COAST OF AFRICA WITHOUT SOME ASSISTANCE BOTH TO OUR SHIP AND TO OURSELVES
HE SAID HE WONDERED AT ONE THING VERY MUCH WHICH WAS TO HEAR ME SPEAK SO LOUD
AS THE VICTOR WAS LED TOWARDS THE THRONE OF THE LADY ROWENA IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE TOTTERED
HE OFTEN BUILDS HIS LARGEST MEN-OF-WAR WHEREOF SOME ARE NINE FEET LONG IN THE WOODS WHERE THE TIMBER GROWS AND HAS THEM CARRIED ON THESE ENGINES THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YARDS TO THE SEA
I WAS MUCH ASTONISHED AT THIS SUDDEN DARKNESS BUT MUCH MORE WHEN I FOUND IT OCCASIONED BY A BIRD OF A MONSTROUS SIZE THAT CAME FLYING TOWARD ME
AND AT NIGHT WHEN IT WAS READY SAID TO HER SON PERHAPS THE STRANGER KNOWS NOT HOW TO FIND OUR HOUSE
BUT TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT I FOUND AFTERWARDS THAT THE RATS HAD EATEN OR SPOILED IT ALL
FOR HER PART SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GENIES AND NEVER SAY ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM
ONE FOOT NEARER AND I PLUNGE MYSELF FROM THE PRECIPICE
OUTSIDE THE LISTS WERE GALLERIES SPREAD WITH TAPESTRY AND CARPETS FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE LADIES AND NOBLES WHO WERE EXPECTED TO ATTEND THE TOURNAMENT
I NOW WALKED TOWARD THE BEACH WHERE I MET THE CREW OF A SHIP THAT HAD CAST ANCHOR TO TAKE IN WATER
BEING A MERCHANT I FREQUENTED MEN OF MY OWN PROFESSION AND PARTICULARLY INQUIRED FOR THOSE WHO WERE STRANGERS THAT PERCHANCE I MIGHT HEAR NEWS FROM BAGDAD OR FIND AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN
IN GOD'S NAME YOUNG MAN TELL ME YOUR NAME AND WHENCE YOU COME MY NAME IS BROWN MOTHER AND I COME FROM THE EAST INDIES HE ANSWERED
FOR IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO KEEP THIS AFFAIR SECRET
THEN THEY CAME ALL CLOSE IN A RING AND FIRED A VOLLEY OF THEIR SMALL ARMS WHICH INDEED WE HEARD AND THE ECHOES MADE THE WOODS RING
TO WHAT FATE
AND AS HE MEANT TO CARRY HIM FURTHER TO EXECUTE HIS DESIGN HE TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN IN ONE OF THE GARDENS ON THE BRINK OF A FOUNTAIN OF CLEAR WATER WHICH DISCHARGED ITSELF BY A LION'S MOUTH OF BRONZE INTO A BASIN PRETENDING TO BE TIRED
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE CEDRIC RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS JESTER
BUT IT WOULD NOT TURN TO ACCOUNT
AND FIRST I LET HIM KNOW HIS NAME SHOULD BE FRIDAY WHICH WAS THE DAY I SAVED HIS LIFE
BUT TWILL DO YOURSELF MUCH GOOD REPLIED MEG MERRILIES
BUT ALL THE ROPES BROKE AND THE SHIP WAS CARRIED BY THE CURRENT TO THE FOOT OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN WHERE SHE STRUCK AND WENT TO PIECES
BUT WHEN I SPOKE IN THAT COUNTRY IT WAS LIKE A MAN TALKING IN THE STREETS TO ANOTHER LOOKING OUT FROM THE TOP OF A STEEPLE UNLESS WHEN I WAS PLACED ON A TABLE OR HELD IN ANY PERSON'S HAND
HE ADMIRED THE QUANTITY OF WOOD OF ALOES AND AMBERGRIS
WHICH BEING WELL PITCHED TO PREVENT LEAKING WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR ALONG THE WALL IN AN OUTER ROOM OF THE PALACE
AND ON SEEING THE LARGE NUMBER OF OLD BOOKS WHICH WERE COMMITTED TO HIS CHARGE HE BECAME ALMOST CRAZY WITH DELIGHT AND SHOUTED HIS FAVOURITE WORD PRO-DI-GI-OUS TILL THE ROOF RUNG TO HIS RAPTURES
MY GOOD MOTHER SAID THE PRINCESS I AM OVERJOYED TO SEE SO HOLY A WOMAN AS YOURSELF WHO WILL CONFER A BLESSING UPON THIS PALACE
SCARED AND CONFOUNDED AS I WAS I COULD NOT FORBEAR GOING ON WITH THESE REFLECTIONS WHEN ONE OF THE REAPERS APPROACHING WITHIN TEN YARDS OF THE RIDGE WHERE I LAY MADE ME APPREHEND THAT WITH THE NEXT STEP I SHOULD BE SQUASHED TO DEATH UNDER HIS FOOT OR CUT IN TWO WITH HIS REAPING-HOOK
CAPTAIN BROWN AS HE WAS NOW KNOWN WAS A HANDSOME AND GALLANT YOUNG FELLOW
THIS HAPPENED TO ME IN FRANCE
IN SHORT THEY USED ALL THE JEWELS THE SULTAN HAD AND BORROWED OF THE VIZIER BUT YET THE WORK WAS NOT HALF DONE
DIRCK HATTERAICK TOLD HIM TOO VERY PLAINLY THAT IF HE WAS TO BE CONDEMNED HE WOULD LET THE SECRET OUT AND RUIN GLOSSIN
WHAT A VILLAIN CRIED THE GOLDSMITH
BUT ALL WAS IN VAIN
DO THOU SO TOO AND ALL SHALL BE WELL
ALI BABA MARRIED A WOMAN AS POOR AS HIMSELF AND LIVED BY CUTTING WOOD AND BRINGING IT UPON THREE ASSES INTO THE TOWN TO SELL
BUT THIS FRIGHTED ME MOST THAT THE ANGELS GATHERED UP SEVERAL AND LEFT ME BEHIND
AND THE THREE WERE LEFT ALONE
AND THE NEXT DAY THE WAGONERS ARRIVED WITH IT BUT NOT IN A VERY GOOD CONDITION
THE NEARER THE SULTAN APPROACHED ALADDIN'S PALACE THE MORE HE WAS STRUCK WITH ITS BEAUTY
WHEN THE OTHER BOAT AND THEIR MEN ENTERING AT THE FORECHAINS SECURED THE FORECASTLE OF THE SHIP AND THE SCUTTLE WHICH WENT DOWN INTO THE COOK-ROOM MAKING THREE MEN THEY FOUND THERE PRISONERS
FROM THENCE THEY WENT TO THE STOREHOUSES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH ALL THINGS NECESSARY BOTH FOR FOOD AND ORNAMENT
