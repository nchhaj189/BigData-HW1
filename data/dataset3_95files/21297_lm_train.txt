NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
BUT I SHOULD HAVE LIKED A DROP FOR MY BREAKFAST AHOY CRIED ONE OF THE MEN LOUDLY
WELL SIR HE WAS MY HUSBAND'S BOY AND HE DID WHAT HIS FATHER TOLD HIM AND YOUR HUSBAND THE MEN CAME AND TOLD ME SIR THAT HE ESCAPED IN THE LUGGER AND THE MEN--WHERE ARE THEY THEY GOT AWAY YESTERDAY SIR THOSE WHO WERE LEFT
HE IS JUST BELOW HERE ON A LEDGE
NO IT WAS A NOISE ON DECK
SUPPOSE THE BOAT DOES NOT COME WHY O COURSE YOU WOULDN'T PAY OH NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU
BRING A BUSHEL OR TWO O LIME STUFF AND STOP UP THIS HOLE ALL BUT A BIT BIG ENOUGH FOR A PIGEON TO GO IN AND OUT
SMART THE PACE WAS INCREASED FOR AWAY IN THE DARKNESS THERE HUNG OUT A BRIGHT SIGNAL WHICH ALL KNEW MEANT RECALL AND THE MIDSHIPMAN'S HEART THROBBED AS HE FELT THAT BEFORE LONG HE WOULD BE IN A BOAT DANCING OVER THE WAVES AND SOON AFTER TREADING THE DECK OF THE SMART LITTLE CUTTER
BESIDES THE TERRIBLY CHILLING SOUNDS HE HAD HEARD HAD CEASED AND HE FELT LESS COWARDLY
AND YOU WON'T FIND NOTHING AT THE HOZE NOT IN THE CELLAR NO SAID RAM FRANKLY
THEN CAME THE IMPORTANT QUESTION--WHERE WERE THEY
DO BE QUIET MASTER WHISPERED THE GREAT FELLOW
I WONDER WHERE THE LAD CAN BE HE WENT CAUTIOUSLY AFT ALONG THE STARBOARD SIDE OF HIS VESSEL LOOKING HARD AT THE FROWNING MASS OF DARKNESS UNDER WHICH THEY LAY AND THINKING HOW DANGEROUS THEIR POSITION WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE WIND BLOWN FROM THE OPPOSITE QUARTER
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN HIS ARTFULNESS TO KEEP US FROM SEARCHING
BUT WELL THINK THE LUGGER WILL COME TO-NIGHT NO I DON'T THINK ANYTHING AND DON'T YOU
BUT ARCHY DID NOT START UP IN PURSUIT
YOUNG GENT HERE THINKS I'M A SMUGGLER
EASY--EASY
WELL MR RAYSTOKE WILL THAT DO ARCHY SHOOK THE HAND HELD OUT AND WENT AFT TO GAZE AT THE CLIFF FEELING THAT SOMEHOW HE LIKED RAM SHACKLE
AND THEN ALL THIS SEA-HAAR WILL GO WHY DON'T YOU SAY MIST CRIED THE LAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY
HURRIEDLY CHANGING THEIR DIRECTION THEY WENT ON AS RAPIDLY AS THE ROUGH GROUND WOULD ALLOW GETTING AN ANSWERING HAIL EVERY TIME THEY SHOUTED AND EACH TIME LOUDER AS IF THOSE WHO CALLED WERE ALSO COMING TOWARD THEM
HERE ALL WAS BLACKER THAN BEFORE BUT IT WAS A HAVEN OF REFUGE AND HE PASSED IN AND SOFTLY CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM TO STAND LISTENING
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I CAME AY AND I WOULDN'T COME NO MORE LITTLE MISSUS CONTINUED JEMMY FROM UNDER HIS HAT FOR IF YOU DID NOT GO OFF THAT THERE DOG GRIP HAD BEEN LOOKING ON UNEASILY AND TURNING HIS HEAD FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AS EACH SPOKE IN TURN
OH DEAR ME HOW SLEEPY I AM WELL SIR I WOULDN'T OPEN MY MOUTH LIKE THAT ERE FORE THE SUN'S UP WHY NOT NO KNOWING WHAT YOU MIGHT SWALLOW OFF THIS HERE NASTY COLD FOGGY STONY COAST THERE YOU GO AGAIN DICK
MY KINDEST COW CRIED MRS SHACKLE
BUT I DURSTN'T MOVE OR I SHOULD GO OVER LIE STILL THEN TILL WE PULL YOU UP
WHAT A WHOP IT DID COME DOWN ON THE ROCK DON'T TALK ABOUT IT SAID ARCHY WITH A SHIVER
THE WELL-OILED WHEEL RAN FAST AND IT WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE THAT OF GLIDING RAPIDLY DOWN AND STEADILY TURNING ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE THICK DARKNESS ALL AROUND AND NOTHING TO SHOW THAT HE WHO DESCENDED WAS NOT STATIONARY
OF COURSE NOT SIR SAID SIR RISDON
WANT SHOUTED THE LAD A STURDY-LOOKING FELLOW WITH KEEN GREY EYES AND FAIR CLOSE CURLY HAIR ALL ABOUT HIS SUNBURNED FOREHEAD
I SHOULD HAVE GONE OVER SHOULDN'T I IF YOU HADN'T KETCHED ME DON'T TALK ABOUT IT OH VERY WELL
WHY DON'T YOU DRAW IT AND COME OUT AND FIGHT
NONSENSE MY LAD
STOP BOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN COME DOWN RAM NODDED AND WENT OFF WHISTLING DOWN ALONG THE HOLLOW FOR SOME HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD THE SEA AND THEN TURNING SHORT OFF TO THE RIGHT HE BEGAN TO CLIMB A ZIGZAG PATH WHICH LED HIGHER AND HIGHER AND MORE AND MORE AWAY TO HIS LEFT TILL IT SKIRTED THE CLIFF AND HE WAS CLIMBING SLOWLY UP THROUGH THE FOG
YOU'RE ONLY A KING'S OFFICER WHEN YOU'RE ABOARD YOUR LITTLE BIT OF A CUTTER WILL YOU LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE IF I LET YOU GO WILL YOU TELL YOUR SKIPPER ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE SEEN YES CRIED ARCHY FIERCELY
THAT WAS AS FAR AS HE COULD GET THEN BUT SOME TIME AFTER THERE CAME A GLEAM OF LIGHT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING AND HE RECALLED THE MISTS THAT HUNG ABOUT THE CHANNEL
WHY HOW CAN IT BE SAID THE BROAD STURDY SAILOR ADDRESSED
NOW AS SOON AS WE'VE TAKEN HIM PRISONER I'LL PUT THE MATTER BEFORE MR BROUGH IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE YOUNG SCAMP WILL BE TIED UP AND GET FOUR DOZEN ON THE BARE BACK HADN'T WE BETTER CATCH HIM FIRST MR GURR RIGHT MR RAYSTOKE
THERE WAS A QUICK RUSTLING SOUND AND BEFORE THE BOY COULD REALISE WHAT WAS TO COME THE DOOR WAS CLOSED THE LOCK SHOT INTO ITS SOCKET AND HE HEARD THE GRINDING SOUND OF BOLTS TOP AND BOTTOM
DON'T SHY AT IT LIKE A HORSE AT A BLUE BOGEY IN A WINDY LANE BUT I TOLD YOU MAN LAST TIME THAT I WOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THAT WRETCHED SMUGGLING DON'T CALL THINGS BY UGLY NAMES MY GOOD MAN IT IS TERRIBLE
HOW WAS HE TO PASS ALL THOSE WEARY HOURS
YOU MADE EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT LAST NIGHT I'LL BE BOUND WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE ROARED THE FARMER
OH YOU COWARD SHE SAID SITTING DOWN AND PULLING HIS EARS AS HE THRUST HIS HEAD INTO HER LAP
THAT'S BETTER HE WAS BACK IN SAFETY ON THE LEDGE OVER THE HOLE AND PASSING ALONG HE HAD SOON DESCENDED TO THE ONE BENEATH THE EXIT
HOW ARE YOU ARCHY MADE NO REPLY
NOW THEN HE SAID AS HE PAUSED FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE COMMENCING HIS DESCENT
DONE SARCHING SIR YES REPLIED ARCHY WHO BEGAN TO FEEL MORE AND MORE ASHAMED OF BEING SUSPICIOUS OF SO FRANK AND BLUFFLY HOSPITABLE A MAN
NO HE SAID ALOUD I MUST GET HELP AND HURRYING TOWARD THE OPENING HE KICKED AGAINST THE BASKET OF PROVISIONS THE LAD HAD BROUGHT BACK
THE DOG TURNED HIS MUZZLE UP TO HIS MISTRESS AND UTTERED A LOW WHINE
IF YOU WERE TAKEN FROM US IT WOULD KILL ME TOO SHE SAID TENDERLY
AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET AT HIM
WE WAS FIGHTING AND I PUT MY FOOT OVER THE SIDE AND COME DOWN HERE HITTING MY HEAD ON THE STONES AND THEN I TURNED SICK AND I KNEW I WAS FALLING OVER AND THEN I WENT TO SLEEP
THEY'LL BE UP TO SOME GAME TO TRAP US SAFE
I SHOULD SAY WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK FOR IS A HOLE PRETTY WELL GROWN OVER WITH GREEN STUFF RIGHT UP AT THE END OF A BIT OF A GULLY AND LOOKING AS IF NO ONE HAD BEEN THERE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS YES SOMETHING LIKE THE MOUTHS OF THE OLD QUARRIES WE HAVE SEEN ADDED ARCHY
SURE YOU'RE GOING RIGHT LAD
THIS DANGER DID NOT CHECK RAM'S CHEERY WHISTLE AND HE CLIMBED ON STICKING HIS TOES WELL INTO THE SHORT GRASS AND RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE REACHED SOME RAGGED SHALE WITH THE GRASS NOW VERY THIN AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET BACK FROM THE SEA IN A SPOT WHICH HE FELT WOULD BE WELL OUT OF THE SIGHT OF THE CUTTER IF THOSE ON BOARD COULD SEE ABOVE THE FOG
NINE OR TEN LYING DOWN IN HER BOTTOM YES CRIED ARCHY
MIND AND DON'T YOU SLIP OVER THE CLIFF RAM SAID HIS MOTHER
AND I SHOULD HAVE BOTH MY BOATS READY FOR MY MEN TO JUMP IN AND CUT HER OFF AS SOON AS SHE GETS CLOSE IN TO THE BEACH
ALL IN VAIN AND OBEYING THE SIGNAL NOW FLYING ON THE CUTTER THE BOAT WAS ROWED BACK
THE MIDSHIPMAN JOINED AS EAGERLY IN THE CHASE AS ANY OF THE MEN FORGETTING AT THE MOMENT ALL ABOUT DISCIPLINE FORMATION AND MATTERS OF THAT KIND FOR IN ONE GLIMPSE WHICH HE HAD OF THE FIGURE HE MADE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS RAM WHOM THEY HAD SURPRISED JUST LEAVING THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE
WHAT OF EM LITTLE MISSUS'S BASKET
AGAIN THE SIGH CAME TO BE FOLLOWED BY A COLD CURRENT OF AIR WHICH SWEPT ACROSS THE BOY'S FACE AND THEN THERE WAS A LOW RUSTLING SOUND WHICH HOVERED IN FRONT OF HIM AND WENT UP AND UP AND UP AND THEN SLOWLY DIED AWAY
BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD FOR HE KNEW THAT IF EVERYTHING WAS NOT DONE TO THE MOMENT THE BOAT WOULD BE STOVE IN
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE SMUGGLERS AND--AND--YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM BELOW WHICH THOSE TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE KNEW WELL AND AS TWO STOOD READY ANOTHER MAN BY THEM TOOK HOLD OF THE ROPE AND SUDDENLY STARTED OFF AT A RUN DISAPPEARING AT ONCE IN THE FOG WHILE A PECULIAR WHIZZING SOUND WAS HEARD AS THE LITTLE WHEEL IN THE BLOCK NOW RAN ROUND TILL ALL AT ONCE A COUPLE OF KEGS AND THE BAG OF STONES APPEARED LEVEL WITH THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
MORNING CRIED ARCHY AND THE MEN ANSWERED HIS REMARK WITH A CHEER FOR THERE WAS A GREY LIGHT COMING FAST NOW IN THE EAST BUT TO THE UTTER ASTONISHMENT OF ALL THE CUTTER DID NOT BECOME VISIBLE
WE MUST HAVE BEEN CLOSE UP TO THE WAY INTO THE CAVE WHEN HE STARTED OUT AND LED US ALL AWAY FROM IT EH I SAY HE JUMPED UP AND DODGED ABOUT KNOWING THE PLACE BY HEART AND KEPT HIDING AND RUNNING OFF AGAIN TO GET US RIGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE THAT'S IT--THAT'S IT MR RAYSTOKE
CAN YOU STAND
I'LL BRING YOU SOME APPLES NEXT TIME I COME AND P'R'APS THEN YOU'LL HAVE A GAME AT CARDS THERE WAS NO REPLY SO RAM SLOWLY SHUT THE DOOR OF THE LANTHORN TURNING THE BRIGHT LIGHT TO A SOFT YELLOWISH GLOW AND RISING TO HIS KNEES
IT COULDN'T BE A DREAM
MAY I YES SAID LIEUTENANT BROUGH SHORTLY
THAT'S WHAT FATHER SAID THIS MORNING ABOUT THE COW
THE FOG DID BEGIN TO GATHER OVER THE SEA SOON AFTER SUNDOWN AND THE DEPRESSING WEATHER SEEMED TO HAVE A CURIOUS EFFECT ON FARMER SHACKLE WHO KEPT GETTING UP FROM HIS SUPPER TO GO AND LOOK OUT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND COME BACK SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS
IT WAS ONLY A MOMENTARY GLANCE AND DIRECTLY AFTER HE TOLD HIMSELF IT WAS NONSENSE FOR THE FIGURE WHICH HAD STARTED UP IN THE NIGHT AWAY ON THE CLIFF WAS RAM SHACKLE AND HE COULD NOT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE
NOT A SOUND TO BE HEARD ON EITHER OF THE LUGGERS LYING AT THEIR BUOYS AND NO LIGHT WAS VISIBLE AT THE COTTAGES AT THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE BAY
WHAT OTHER HOUSES ARE THERE NEAR HERE ASKED GURR AT LAST
THERE WAS A SHAKE A WRENCH AND AS HE CLUNG TIGHTLY TO THE MAN HIS ARMS WERE DRAGGED AS IT FELT TO HIM HALF OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS AND HE WAS THROWN TO COME DOWN FORTUNATELY ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES
YES SIR THERE IS AND IT WILL GO HARD WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT HAVING ANY DEALINGS WITH THE SMUGGLERS LADY GRAEME LOOKED GHASTLY
HALF-STARVED THEY ARE SOMETIMES
SUPPOSE A LAD TO HAVE EATEN A HEARTY SUPPER OF SOME PARTICULARLY HARD PASTRY
REALLY I HARDLY THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO COMMIT SO SERIOUS AN ACT OF RUDENESS TOWARDS A GENTLEMAN
PULL HER HORNS OFF SIR SAID DICK IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION AS HE PROCEEDED TO PASS THE ROPE THROUGH A BLOCK NOT IT BUT HADN'T WE BETTER HAVE A LINE ROUND HER IF YOU WANT TO CUT HER MOST IN TWO SIR
ANYWAY IT IS A GOOD FAST-MOVING STORY WITH LOTS OF WELL-DRAWN HUMAN INTEREST
HE DID NOT TURN HIS HEAD FOR HIS LOBSTER EYES HAD CONVINCED HIM THAT NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT AND AS HE DISAPPEARED IN THE DEEP HOLE HE POUNCED UPON THE BASKET AND THEN WENT SOFTLY AND QUICKLY DOWN TO WHERE THE LOOSE TILE STONES LAY
BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT
OH THANK GOD CRIED THE POOR WOMAN SINKING UPON HER KNEES TO COVER HER FACE WITH HER HANDS SOBBING VIOLENTLY AND ROCKING HERSELF TO AND FRO
I WAS OBLIGED TO DO WHAT I DID SAME AS YOU'D HAVE BEEN IF IT HAD BEEN T'OTHER WAY ON
CAPITAL PRIZE YOU'VE TAKEN.--DO YOU HEAR SIR
THAT HIS WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT DUTY BUT THAT AS A GENTLEMAN SIR RISDON WOULD SEE THAT THE KING'S OFFICERS HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO CARRY OUT THEIR DUTY
MAKE INLAND FOR THE WOODS AND HIDE THERE ARCHY NODDED AND NO MORE WAS SAID DURING THE DARK JOURNEY
THEN HE RECEIVED A SHARP BLOW FROM A CUDGEL WHICH SENT HIM STAGGERING FORWARD AND DIRECTLY AFTER A DULL CUT FROM A STEEL WEAPON WHICH FORTUNATELY FOR HIM FELL UPON AND ACROSS THE ROPE WHICH BOUND HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES
BUT BEFORE THEY WERE HALF WAY THERE ARCHY WHO HAD BEEN THINKING DEEPLY SUDDENLY SAID TO GURR I SAY THOUGH ISN'T HE RIGHT WHAT ABOUT MY LAD ARE WE SURE THAT A CARGO WAS LANDED LAST NIGHT DIDN'T YOU AND THE SKIPPER FIND THREE KEGS YES BUT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE A MONTH AGO WHY OF COURSE MY LAD
THE LITTLE OFFICER STARTED AS THE MAN TOUCHED HIS ELBOW SO SILENTLY HAD HE APPROACHED AND ON LOOKING DOWN HE DIMLY MADE OUT THAT THE MAN HAD DIVESTED HIMSELF OF HIS HEAVY BOOTS
SUPPOSE AS SOON AS HE GOT INTO THE HALL OR WHATEVER PLACE IT WAS HE SHOULD HEAR THAT SIGH AGAIN AND THE RUSTLING SOUND
ON AGAIN IN THE DARKNESS THE OFFICERS PACING ALONG PORTIONS OF THE LINE TO URGE ON THE MEN TO BE CAREFUL AND WARNING THOSE NEAR THE CLIFF EDGE
HE COULD NOT STIR FOR THE FARMER'S WIFE STOOD AT THE OPEN DOOR AND THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD HAVE CAUSED A DISCOVERY
HE SEEMED TO DRINK IT IN DRAWING DOWN GREAT DRAUGHTS WHICH MADE HIS BOSOM SWELL HIS HEART BEAT AND THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN LIKE A SCHOOLBOY UPON WHOM HAS SUDDENLY COME THE JOYS OF AN UNEXPECTED HALF-HOLIDAY HE FELT READY TO JUMP UP TOSS HIS CAP IN THE AIR AND SHOUT FOR JOY
YOU BEHAVED VERY BRAVELY AND WELL RAM MEAN IT--_SIR YES I DO INDEED THANK YE--SIR SAID RAM
AND NOW HE HAS COME WITH HIS HATEFUL MEN TO TAKE PAPA TO PRISON AND OH YES YES YES SIR RISDON OF COURSE I MUST WRITE MY DESPATCH
THEN THEY PUSHED OFF ROWING WITH MUFFLED OARS AND KEEPING RIGHT AWAY FROM THE CLIFFS SO THAT ANY WATCHER THERE SHOULD HAVE NO INDICATION OF THEIR PASSING
BUT POVERTY SEEMED TO HAVE SET ITS MARK UPON THE PLACE AND THE BOY WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THE GLOOMY ASPECT OF THE HOUSE THAT HE CEASED WHISTLING AS HE WENT ACROSS THE FRONT OUTSIDE THE LOW WALL AND ROUND TO THE BACK WHERE HIS PROGRESS WAS STOPPED BY THE SCAMPERING OF FEET AND A DOG CAME UP BARKING LOUDLY
I KNOW I HAVE CRIED ARCHY EXCITEDLY
HE KNEW HER BY THE DOG THOUGH EVEN AT THAT DISTANCE AS SHE MOVED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY OVER THE SHORT TURF OF THE TREELESS EXPANSE ALONG BY THE SEA HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURE THAT IT WAS SIR RISDON'S CHILD
EXCUSE ME INTERRUPTED THE BARONET
I AM UNWILLING TO SEARCH THE PLACE
PERHAPS YOU CAN WITH YOUR YOUNG EYES OH IT'S ALL RIGHT GROWLED THE BOATSWAIN
WELL SEEN ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS NO SIR SAID DICK ON'Y MY FINGERS IS A ITCHIN SCRATCH THEM THEN NAY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND GRUMBLED DICK
AND THE POOR GIRL LAY ALL DAY IN THE HOT SUN AND AT LAST SAW THAT NIGHT WAS COMING ON AND THAT THERE WAS NO HELP
BUT AS THE CUTTER SHOWED NO LIGHTS THIS WAS ALL GUESS-WORK AND MADE THE TASK RATHER ANXIOUS
NOT TO-NIGHT MY LAD
SO GREAT WAS THE IMPETUS GIVEN THAT BUT FOR A DESPERATE EFFORT TO KEEP HIS FEET AND A BOUND OR TWO THE LAD WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN UPON HIS FACE
PRAY WHAT SORT OF A GAME DO YOU CALL THIS GAME SIR SAID ARCHY RUEFULLY
CELIA SAT WATCHING A LITTLE SNAKE WHICH WAS WRIGGLING RAPIDLY ALONG PAST HER A LITTLE CREATURE WHOSE SCALES LOOKED LIKE OXIDISED SILVER IN THE AFTERNOON SUNSHINE AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO RISE AND TRY TO CAPTURE THE BURNISHED REPTILE KNOWING FROM OLD EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS HARMLESS WHEN AT ONE AND THE SAME MOMENT SHE BECAME AWARE THAT GRIP WAS MISSING AND THAT RAM SHACKLE AND THE BIG LABOURER FROM THE FARM JEMMY DADD WERE COMING UP A HOLLOW AWAY TO THE RIGHT ONE BY WHICH THEY COULD REACH THE DOWN-LIKE FIELDS THAT SPREAD ALONG THE EDGE OF THE CLIFFS FROM THE FARM
RAMILLIES--COMMONLY KNOWN BY HIS FATHER'S MEN AS RAM--SHACKLE TROTTED UP OVER THE HILL STOPPING ONCE TO FLOP DOWN ON THE GRASS TO GAZE AT THE CUTTER LYING A MILE OUT NOW FROM THE SHORE AND THINKING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS WITH HER TRIM RIGGING AND WHITE SAILS TO THE ROUGH LUGGER OF HIS FATHER AND THE DIRTY THREE-MASTED VESSELS THAT RAN TO AND FRO ACROSS THE CHANNEL AND UPON WHICH HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE TAKEN A TRIP
TEN MINUTES LATER THEY HEARD VOICES BY DEGREES THESE BECAME A MURMUR AND THEY KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE SEVERAL OF THE MEN TOGETHER
SO HE TOILED ON WELL INTO THE NIGHT PICKING AND LOOSENING TINY SCRAPS OF MORTAR WHICH HARD THOUGH IT WAS HAD FORTUNATELY FOR HIM BEEN MADE OF AN EXCEEDINGLY COARSE SAND OR RATHER VERY FINE SHINGLE WHOSE TINY PEBBLES FORMED EACH A POINT TO WORK UPON TILL IT WAS LOOSENED AND FELL
OH I SEE HE SAID THAT ALARMED YOU
AND I'D OFTEN BE SENDING A CHICKEN OR A FEW EGGS OR A KIT O BUTTER OR DROP O MILK ALL TO THE HOZE ONLY WE'RE FEARED HER LADYSHIP MIGHT THINK IT RUDE IT'S--IT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU MASTER SHACKLE AND I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU TCHAH
JEMMY DADD AND ME'S CAUGHT EM BEFORE NOW
GO SLOWLY AND NOT TOO NEAR NOT TOO NIGH IT IS SIR SAID DICK WITH A SIGH
HULLO HE CRIED IN A WHISPER AS IF HE DID NOT WISH TO BE HEARD
NOW THEN KEEP STEP THE SAME GRUFF VOICE SAID
WON'T YOU HELP ME TO SEND MY POOR INNOCENT FATHER TO PRISON SAID CELIA IN A LOW VOICE
I SAY SKIPPER HERE YOU MUSTN'T SPEAK TO AN OFFICER LIKE THAT WHISPERED ARCHY
I LOOKED OVER
YES I HAVE FOUND OUT ALL I WANTED TO KNOW AH CAME AGAIN OUT OF THE DARKNESS IN A LOW WAILING TONE
HE LISTENED BUT THE NIGHT WAS TOO CALM FOR THE WAVES TO BE HEARD AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS AND GAZE WHICH WAY HE WOULD THERE WAS NOTHING BUT DIMLY SEEN RUGGED GROUND WITH OCCASIONAL SLOPES OF SMOOTH SHORT GRASS
I RECK'LECT NOW HE SAID
I WISH I WAS GOING WITH YOU BUT THAT CANNOT BE CHAPTER THIRTY SIX
FOLLOW ME THE MIDSHIPMAN HAD HARDLY GIVEN THE COMMAND WHEN THERE WAS ANOTHER EXPLOSION A FRESH FLASH OF FIRE WHICH NEARLY REACHED THEM AND HE SAW BEYOND THE DANCING TONGUES OF FLAME THE BLACK OPENING HE SOUGHT
THAT'S BETTER
THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU MR ORFICER
WON'T BRING THE ROOF DOWN WILL IT JEMMY NAY NOT IT LAD
I SUPPOSE HE LIKED THAT SAID ARCHY AFTER A TIME TALKING ALOUD FOR IT WAS PLEASANT TO HEAR A VOICE IN THE SOLEMN DARKNESS EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY HIS OWN
IT'S AN UNPLEASANT ONE THAT WE MUST SEARCH YOUR PLACE FOR CONTRABAND GOODS SARCH
THEY'LL THINK I'M SOMEWHERE ABOUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE CREPT ON EXPECTING TO PASS THROUGH AN OPENING INTO DAYLIGHT THE NEXT MOMENT
BRING THE MAN AFT CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
I WON'T REST TILL I AM POST-CAPTAIN AND AS SOON AS YOU CAN PASS YOU SHALL BE MY LIEUTENANT
ONCE OR TWICE HE HESITATED FOR THE WAY LAY SO LOW DOWN IN THE VALLEY WITH THE HILLS TOWERING UP TO SUCH A HEIGHT ON EITHER SIDE THAT THE NIGHT SEEMED AS DARK AS DURING THE FOG OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
THAT IS A GOOD UN AND NO MISTAKE ARCHY WAS TAKEN ABACK FOR THE MOMENT BUT HE CAUGHT THE EYE OF THE MASTER WHO WAS TOO OLD OVER THE BUSINESS TO BE EASILY HOODWINKED
FED YOU TOO WELL HAVE I
WHO WANTS REPAYING SIR RISDON
AY SO THAT CHAP SAYS
AND RUN UP AND HAVE A GOOD LOOK ROUND THE BOAT WAS TURNED BACKED IN AND SEIZING THE RIGHT MOMENT THE MEN JUMPED ON TO THE ROCK JUST AS THE WATER WAS ONLY ANKLE-DEEP HAD A GOOD SEARCH ROUND AND CAME BACK TO BE PICKED UP AGAIN SAFELY THOUGH THE BOAT WAS WITHIN AN ACE OF BEING CAPSIZED
WE'RE WORKING WRONG WAY ON
OLD MARY TOLD ME AND MRS SHACKLE MENTIONED IT TOO AY CONTINUED JEMMY WITHOUT REMOVING HIS HAT SHE FELL SLIP-SLAP INTO THE SEA POOR THING AY LITTLE MISSUS
OH ONLY WAIT TILL I GET MY CHANCE HE MUTTERED AND HE INVOLUNTARILY CLENCHED HIS FISTS
AND SUPPOSING THAT THE BLINDED MAN PRO TEM IS PROPERLY BANDAGED AND CANNOT GET A SQUINT OF LIGHT UP BY THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE AND ALSO SUPPOSING THAT HE CONFUSES HIMSELF BY TURNING ROUND THE PROPER NUMBER OF TIMES HONESTLY HE WILL BE IN PROFOUND DARKNESS AND IN UTTER IGNORANCE OF THE DIRECTION OF DOOR WINDOW OR THE SALIENT OBJECTS IN THE ROOM
AND ARCHY DASHED FORWARD BUT WAS THROWN BACK AND HAD TO RETREAT AS A FRESH KEG EXPLODED AND ADDED TO THE SIZE OF THE POOL NOW ALMOST A RIVER OF FIRE MANY YARDS WIDE
OH HOW FOOLISH
I SHOULD HAVE WALKED RIGHT ON TO HIM AND BEEN CAUGHT THE STEPS CAME NEARER AND AT LAST IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO PASS ON WHEN A GRUFF VOICE FROM CLOSE BY SAID WELL LAD THERE WAS A SUDDEN STOPPAGE AND AN EXCLAMATION AND MADE ME JUMP MASTER DON'T TALK FOOLERY SAID THE FIRST VOICE IN IMPATIENT TONES AND TO ARCHY IT WAS UNMISTAKABLE
IF I ONLY DARED ASK WHOEVER THIS IS THOUGHT ARCHY I SHOULD DO HIS THOUGHTS TOOK ANOTHER DIRECTION DIRECTLY FOR APPARENTLY ABOUT TWENTY YARDS AWAY HE HEARD SOME ONE SNEEZE AND THEN MUTTER IMPATIENTLY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER SNEEZE
EVEN IF A ROPE HAD BEEN LOWERED DOWN TO HIM FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO AVAIL FOR HE REALISED NOW THAT WHICH HE COULD NOT SEE FROM THE HOLE BY WHICH HE HAD ESCAPED TO WIT THAT THE CLIFF PROJECTED ABOVE THE OPENING AND A LOWERED DOWN ROPE WOULD HAVE HUNG SEVERAL FEET RIGHT AWAY CLEAR
SCATTER YOU WON'T TRY AGAIN TO-NIGHT TRY
WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION THE LAD FOLLOWED KEEPING ALONG THE GRASSY MARGE OF THE ROAD AND LISTENING INTENTLY TO MAKE OUT AT LAST THE DULL SOUND OF STEPS WHICH TOLD THAT THE MAN WHO MADE THEM WAS WALKING BAREFOOT
FOR THE LUGGER HAD ESCAPED TO HOLLAND CONSEQUENT UPON THE WHITE HAWK BEING SO SHORT-HANDED AND IT WAS TOWARD EVENING THAT SHE CAME CLOSE IN TO SEARCH FOR THE CREWS AND ALL THE PARTY DESCENDED IN SAFETY TO THE BOAT WHICH ROWED UNDER IN ANSWER TO THE SIGNALS MADE BY FIRING PISTOLS
THE ANSWER CAME AT ONCE
IT WOULD BE RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY
WAIT A BIT AND I'LL SHOW THEM THAT I'M NOT SO STUPID AS THEY THINK
RAM BENT HIS HEAD DOWN IN THE BOAT
COULD I HAVE DREAMED IT SHE ASKED HERSELF AGAIN
GET IT OUT OF JEMMY HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HAVEN'T GOT A GLASS
THERE WAS NO CUTTER IN VIEW BUT HE DID NOT TROUBLE ABOUT THAT
YOU'RE WELCOME SQUIRE I THANK YOU MASTER SHACKLE--I THANK YOU WARMLY
BUT AS THAT PAIN DECLINED HE FELT COLD AND AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF HESITATION HE SUDDENLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS TO PULL UP THE CLOTHES
DON'T SAY THAT BUT I DO CRIED ARCHY
THERE COME ON HOME AND GET TO BED
THE NEXT MORNING SHE PARTOOK OF HER BREAKFAST QUITE EARLY--A SIMPLE ENOUGH MEAL CONSISTING OF BARLEY BREAD AND A CUP OF FRESH MILK FROM THE SHACKLES FARM AND TAKING A BASKET SHE CALLED GRIP WHO CAME BOUNDING ABOUT HER IN A STATE OF THE MOST EXUBERANT DELIGHT
OH VERY WELL HE SAID YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE
COULDN'T SAY ME NAY POOR FELLOW
NO ONE ABOUT HERE WOULD INJURE A BOY HUMPH EJACULATED GURR LOOKING AT THE BARONET SEARCHINGLY
WHAT SHOULD HE DO THEN
THINK OF YOU BEING SHUT UP ALL ALONE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
THE OLD RASCAL THOUGHT ARCHY AS HE MENTALLY PICTURED THE STERN SAD COUNTENANCE OF SIR RISDON
A MOMENT OR TWO LATER HE HEARD A RATTLING NOISE WHICH HE RECOGNISED AS THAT MADE BY A HORSE SHAKING HIS HARNESS AND ONCE MORE ARCHY'S HEART BEAT HIGH
BUT I TAKE YOU ALL TO WITNESS MY LADS THEY TACKED US FIRST AY AY
RAM WAS IN THE BOAT AND RIGHT FORWARD HIS RED CAP SHOWING OUT PLAINLY IN THE MORNING LIGHT
I MUST GO NOW
IF YOU ARE GOING FROM HERE I GO TOO GOT THE LANTHORN RAM LAD CRIED JEMMY
IN ANOTHER TEN MINUTES THEY CAME UPON A GROUP STEADILY APPROACHING
AND I SUPPOSE SIR ALL THE OLD HOME WILL BE TAKEN AND DESTROYED OH I DON'T KNOW
OH IF I ONLY GET HOLD OF HIM
AND IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T COME ALONG TOP O THEY CLIFTS AT ALL
THERE SELECT YOUR CREW AND BE OFF AT ONCE NO SIR
GIVE ME YOUR HAND DICK HE WHISPERED
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
HE WOULD SOON PUT THAT TO THE PROOF HE TOLD HIMSELF
IS THAT LITTLE SWORD SHARP OF COURSE PULL IT OUT AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK ARCHY FROWNED
PLACE ISN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE TO BE HIDING WITHOUT OUR HEARING THEM PLENTY MR GURR SAID ARCHY FIRMLY
PULL AWAY AND UP SHE COMES
HENCE THE SUCCESSFUL LANDING OF MANY A BOAT-LOAD WHICH HAD BEEN SCATTERED THE COUNTRY THROUGH
THERE'S A LOT NOT FAR FROM THE KEGS THE MEN CHEERED AS THE FRESH ORDER WAS GIVEN AND A NEW SET TOOK THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO WERE GROWING WEARY SENDING THE STONES OUT RAPIDLY TILL THERE WAS ROOM FOR A MAN TO CREEP THROUGH
IF THEY HAD BEEN GOING TO DO THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BLINDFOLDED HIS EYES
IT WOULD BE GLORIOUS
I HAVEN'T DONE WITH IT BUT I WANT IT TO TAKE BACK IT HAS SOME OF THE DINNER IN IT WELL THEN LET'S EMPTY IT OUT NO SAID ARCHY SITTING UP ANGRILY
SHOW ME THE WAY OUT OH VERY WELL THIS WAY THEN
I COULD IF SOME ONE LOWERED ME A LITTLE MORE NO NO MY LAD NO NO WHISPERED THE MASTER
BETTER CHUCK HIM OFF THE CLIFF WHAT CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN FIERCELY
MIND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DON'T DO THAT BLENHEIM CRIED MRS SHACKLE
THEN IT SEEMED TO BECOME THINNER AND JUST AS THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS THINKING TO HIMSELF HOW GLORIOUS IT WOULD BE IF THE MAN AND BOY IN THE BOAT SHOULD PROVE TO BE HIS OLD FRIENDS RAM AND JEMMY DADD THERE CAME A PECULIAR SQUEAKING SOUND FROM SOMEWHERE AHEAD
ONE OF THESE DAYS OR NIGHTS OR WHATEVER THEY ARE I'LL LIE WAIT FOR YOU AND BREAK YOUR HEAD WITH A STONE AND THEN GET AWAY RAM LAUGHED
HE JUMPED UP FROM THE CHAIR FEELING HORRIBLY STIFF AND LOOKED STEADILY ROUND FOR A WAY TO ESCAPE BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE
IF THE THINGS WERE NOT FETCHED AWAY IT WOULD BE LOCKED UP
BUT WHAT TO DO
THEN CAME A DULL ECHOING WHICH DIED OFF IN WHISPERS AND ALL WAS PERFECTLY STILL
WITH ONE YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS AND THE PRISONER NO
HIST JEMMY HE WHISPERED
NOT THE LAD TO GO OFF ON ANY PRANK.--THERE GO BELOW AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT MY LADS.--ALL COMES OF BEING SENT INTO A MISERABLE LITTLE BOAT LIKE THIS TO HUNT SMUGGLERS AHOY CAME FROM FORWARD
KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT ON THE CLIFF TO SEE IF MR RAYSTOKE IS MAKING SIGNALS FOR A BOAT
TAKE ANOTHER CASE
YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE THEN
WELL WOMAN SAID THE LIEUTENANT SEVERELY
I THINK I CAN WALK
HOW DID THEY COME THERE
HE CAN
HOW HE GOT DOWN HE HARDLY KNEW BUT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE GREAT SHELF HE WAS SO INCOMMODED BY THE ROPE THAT HE CONTRIVED SPREAD-EAGLED AS HE WAS AGAINST THE ROCK FACE TO GET IT OVER HIS HEAD AND THEN CAREFULLY LET IT DROP UTTERING A CRY OF ANGUISH AS HE SAW IT FALL CATCHING AGAINST A PIECE OF ROCK WHICH DIVERTED ITS COURSE SO THAT IT RESTED NEARLY HALF OVER THE EDGE AND HE CLUNG THERE GAZING DOWN WILDLY EXPECTING TO SEE IT DISAPPEAR IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CLIMB AGAIN FOR ANOTHER COIL
TO YOU SIR--A MERE BOY
TELLS ME HE SAID THAT SHE'S CHOKE FULL O HOLLANDS GIN AND LACE INDEED SAID THE LIEUTENANT EAGERLY
I HAVE SEEN NO ONE ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION HERE BEG PARDON SIR BUT CAN YOU AS A GENTLEMAN ASSURE ME THAT HE IS NOT HERE CERTAINLY SAID SIR RISDON
THEN AS THERE WAS NO ANSWER HE WENT SLOWLY AWAY WITH THE PRISONER WATCHING THE DULL GLOW OF THE LANTHORN TILL IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GREAT PILLARS THERE WAS A FAINT SUGGESTION OF LIGHT FARTHER ON THEN DARKNESS AGAIN THE DULL ECHOING BANG OF THE HEAVY TRAP-DOOR AND RATTLE OF THE THIN SLABS OF STONE WHICH SEEMED TO BE THROWN OVER IT TO ACT AS A COVER OR SCREEN AND THEN ONCE AGAIN THE SILENCE AND UTTER DARKNESS WHICH SAT UPON THE PRISONER LIKE LEAD
DON'T TURN YOURSELF INTO A FIGUREHEAD OF AN OLD WRECK SIR
ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MAN CROSS
THEN UP WOULD GO LIGHTS SOMEWHERE YONDER ON THE HILLS AND THE BOAT WOULD GO BACK OF COURSE
WHAT IS IT WHISPERED SHACKLE WHO SEEMED CLOSE TO WHERE THE MIDSHIPMAN STOOD
THE DEEP WATER AFTER THAT AWFUL FALL THE FIERCE CURRENT WHICH WOULD CARRY HIM OUT TO SEA--AND THEN CAME SHUDDERING THOUGHTS OF THE GREAT LONG SERPENT-LIKE CONGERS OF WHOSE DOINGS HORRIBLE STORIES WERE CURRENT AMONG THE SAILORS
IT CAME NEARER AND NEARER THEN THERE WAS A LOW SIGH THE DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN FOR THE RUSTLING CAME QUITE PLAINLY NOW ACCOMPANIED BY A FAINT BREATHING
SHACKLE SAW THEM GO AND GUESSING THEIR DESTINATION CHUCKLED
PEOPLE WON'T BE TOO EAGER TO TELL EM WHOSE BOATS THEY ARE AND I MIGHT WANT TO GET AWAY HE REMAINED THINKING ABOUT HIS SON FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HIS COUNTENANCE LIGHTENED
THERE IT WILL NOT BE SAFE TO LAND MY LADS
CLEAR OFF MORE STONES MY LADS
THERE YOU CAN HEAR EM NOW IN CORROBORATION OF THE BOATSWAIN'S WORDS THERE WAS A DULL THUNDEROUS SOUND OVERHEAD AS OF GREAT STONES BEING THROWN DOWN OVER THE TRAP-DOOR AND ALL LISTENED IN SILENCE FOR A TIME TILL THE NOISE CEASED
GET A BUCKET AND MILK HER
IT WAS HITTING MY HEAD SUCH A CRACK I SUPPOSE
LET ME TELL YOU THAT KNOWING AS I DID WHAT A YOUNG SCAMP YOU WERE I REFRAINED FROM REPORTING YOUR CONDUCT AT PORTSMOUTH TO GET YOU DISMISSED HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE
CK LAUGHED JEMMY
MRS SHACKLE WAS VERY QUIET AND GRAVE-LOOKING AND SILENT FOR A TIME BUT AT LAST SHE VENTURED A QUESTION
TAKE YOUR COW AND GO HE SAID
THEY WILL PUT HIM IN PRISON AND--AND THERE WAS A LOW BURST OF SOBBING AND THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN FELT HIS OWN BREAST SWELL
LET YOU AND ME BE FRIENDS AND I COULD COME OFTEN AND SIT WITH YOU
I'M INCLINED TO THINK THE SIGNAL WAS A WARNING TO KEEP OFF
THE DOG'S SATISFACTION WAS A LITTLE DAMPED AS HIS MISTRESS TOOK HER WAY TOWARD THE FIR-WOOD AND HE KEPT MAKING RUSHES BY ANOTHER PATH
NO--I'LL SEND RAMILLIES
OLD GURR KNEW THAT AND HE WINKED SOLEMNLY AT THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN
I COULD HEAR YOU A MILE AWAY RIGHT GO AND TELL EM TO KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT IN THE COVE AND THEN TO RUN THE MOMENT A BOAT COMES IN SIGHT NO BOAT WON'T COME IN SIGHT TO-NIGHT
THAT'S IT CRIED GURR
SUDDENLY THE SOBBING CEASED AND THE GIRL SAID SLOWLY YOU SHALL NOT TELL
WE MUST HACK DOWN THAT DOOR ROARED ARCHY
WHO WANT'S TO CRIED RAM
NO OCCASION TO HURRY HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM HE SAT DOWN AND GAZED OUT TO SEA NOTING A SAIL FAR AWAY TO THE RIGHT BUT THE VESSEL WAS A SCHOONER--IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH HE SOUGHT
DO YOU WANT TO SMOTHER ME HE SAID
WILL HE COME BACK HE LISTENED AND LISTENED AND HESITATED BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND AND STILL HE HESITATED TILL QUITE A COUPLE OF HOURS MUST HAVE PASSED WHEN HE UTTERED A LOUD EXULTANT CRY DETERMINED NOW TO MAKE ONE BOLD DASH FOR LIBERTY AND MADE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE DARKNESS FOR THE OPEN WAY
COME ASHORE YESTERDAY MRS SHACKLE SHOOK HER HEAD
BUT I'M MUCH WORSE THAN HIM BUT THE SMUGGLERS ALL SEEMED TO COME OVER US SIR
FOR IN THE STILLNESS OF SUCH A CALM NIGHT A VOICE TRAVELS FAR AND THE LIEUTENANT KNEW THAT A STRANGE SOUND WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ALARM THOSE FOR WHOM HE WAS WAITING AND SEND THE BOAT AWAY AGAIN TO SEA
IT'S FRESH AND WARM
WORSE THAN AN OLD SEA BEACH
IN THE KING'S NAME--SURRENDER HIS WORDS WENT ROLLING AND ECHOING THROUGH THE PLACE BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
I'D SIT DOWN AND WAIT FOR MORNING ONLY CONSCIENCE WON'T LET ME WELL LET'S TRY THIS WAY SUGGESTED ARCHY
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO MY LAD WHISPERED THE MASTER AGAIN
SAY AWK-WARD IN FUTURE NOT AWK'ARD CERTAINLY SIR I'LL TRY SAID THE MASTER
CLATTER
THEN AS HE FELT THE STRONG HEMP QUIVER IN HIS HANDS HE FOUND HIMSELF WONDERING IF THE STRANDS WOULD SNAP ONE BY ONE WITH THE TERRIBLE STRAIN OF THE JERK AND WHETHER THE BOY WOULD DROP DOWN INTO THE SEA
JUST THEN HE KNEW THAT SOME ONE ELSE THOUGHT AS HE DID FOR A HAND TOUCHED HIS ARM AND A VOICE WHISPERED IT WASN'T MY FAULT
OH MY LAD MY LAD I WISH WE WERE ABOARD BUT IT WAS A LONG PULL FROM THE COVE TO WHERE THE CUTTER LAY NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE AND THOUGH THE MASTER AND ARCHY KEPT STRAINING THEIR EYES TO CATCH SIGHT OF THEIR LITTLE VESSEL SHE WAS INVISIBLE
SLOWLY AND WITH HER EYES DILATED AND STRAINED THE GIRL CREPT BACK STEP BY STEP AS SHE WITHSTOOD HER DESIRE TO RUN AWAY FOR ALL AT ONCE THE THOUGHT HAD COME THAT PERHAPS SOME SHEPHERD OR LABOURER HAD FALLEN DOWN TO THE BOTTOM AND WAS PERHAPS LYING HERE WITH A BROKEN LEG
THEN YOU CAN TAKE ME RIGHT TO THE PLACE MR RAYSTOKE SAID GURR
WILL IT JEMMY DO
NOW NO TRIFLING
SO WITH THE WAY OF ESCAPE OPEN TO HIM AND FREEDOM READY TO WELCOME HIM ONCE AGAIN HE HURRIED BACK LANTHORN IN HAND SELECTED A COIL OF ROPE FROM THE PILE OF STORES THREW IT OVER HIS SHOULDER PASSING HIS LEFT ARM THROUGH AND LEAVING THE LANTHORN WHERE HE HAD FOUND IT HE HURRIED BACK TO THE NARROW PASSAGE CLIMBED THE SLOPE AND THE STEPS UP TO THE OPENING
COME ON BEFORE THE MIDSHIPMAN COULD RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE HE FELT HIMSELF RUN FORWARD BY THE TWO HANDS WHICH HAD BEEN DROPPED ON HIS SHOULDERS THRUST THROUGH THE DOOR THE FARMER WHISPERING SAVAGELY WORK OR I'LL BREAK YOUR NECK AND GIVING HIM A FIERCE PUSH AND A KICK WHICH DROVE HIM ALONG A PASSAGE WHERE ON HIS LEFT WAS THE OPEN DOORWAY INTO THE DIMLY LIT CELLAR
I'LL COME LAST AND UNFASTEN IT AND THEN HOW WILL YOU GET DOWN SAID THE MASTER SUSPICIOUSLY
DON'T BE SO THIN-SKINNED ABOUT A NICKNAME THAT'S IT SIR
SOME ONE'S PURSUING OF SOMETHING
AND HE HAD DRAWN HIMSELF UP BEHIND THE BUSH BY THE TIME THE FARMER HAD CLOSED THE DOOR THE SUDDEN CHANGE FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT PREVENTING SHACKLE FROM SEEING THE SPY UPON HIS PROCEEDINGS
OH MY HEAD HE GROANED
THEY ARE ON THE SCENT OF THE SMUGGLED GOODS AND I AM TO BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR POSSESSION
BUT--BUT YOU WILL GO AND--AND TELL--ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THEN CAME FAINTLY THE WORDS I--DON'T--WANT TO
FROM TIME TO TIME RAM LOOKED DOWN AT HIS ESCAPED PRISONER AND THEN DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE PLACES WHERE HE SHOULD NEVER PLANT HIS FEET ACHIEVING THE WHOLE IN THE MOST FEARLESS MANNER AND FINISHING WITH A LEAP WHICH LANDED HIM NEAR WHERE ARCHY STOOD GAZING AT HIM REGULARLY AT BAY
BUT AS HE WENT DOWN A FEW STEPS IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SCANNED THE PLACE HE WAS PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED
HE ROSE WITH A SIGH AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW AND ALONG A REGULAR TROUGH AMONG THE HILLS TO THE LOW WHITE-WASHED STONE BUILDING ROOFED WITH THIN PIECES OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND GAILY DOTTED AND SPLASHED WITH LICHEN AND MOSS
ANY ONE THERE CAME IN THE SAME FAINT TONES
YES MY LAD
FRIED FISH TO-DAY AND PORK PIE
CALL A HALT GURR WHISPERED ARCHY AT LAST
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM NO WHY I'M A FARMER
TAKE NO NOTICE
AND NO ROPE WITH US EXCLAIMED THE MASTER
BACK QUICK TO THE ENTRANCE
RATS
AND IT WAS ONLY YES YES
TRAP-DOOR--DOOR INTO A TRAP HE THOUGHT
OH NOT MUCH
SIDES SIR SHE WAS JUST AFORE US TEN MINUTES AGO AND WE HEARD HER LOWERING DOWN HER MAST AND SAIL COULD THAT HAVE BEEN A GULL WHAT MAKE A SQUEAL LIKE A WHEEL IN A BLOCK
I COULD JUMP INTO DEEP WATER AND SWIM IF THERE WERE NO WAY DOWN FROM BELOW THERE HIS SPIRITS ROSE NOW FOR THOUGH A FALSE STEP OR SLIP OF THE FOOT WOULD HAVE SENT HIM HEADLONG DOWN TO THE BROAD LEDGE FROM WHICH HE WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE BOUNDED INTO THE SEA THE CLIMBING WAS GOOD AND PANTING WITH THE EXERTION HE GOT FROM PROJECTION TO LEDGE NOW STRAIGHT DOWN NOW DIAGONALLY AND OFTEN ALONG FIRST ONE TINY LEDGE OR CORNICE AND THEN ANOTHER ZIG-ZAGGING TILL AT ABOUT TWENTY FEET FROM THE PLACE HE WAS MAKING FOR A SLATY PIECE OF THE LIMESTONE ROCK BY WHICH HE WAS HOLDING PARTED FROST-LOOSENED FROM THE PARENT ROCK AND HE WENT DOWN WITH A RUSH
EVERYTHING SEEMED DRY AND THOUGH HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY HE COULD NOT HEAR THE WASHING OF THE WAVES AMONG THE ROCKS NOR SMELL THE COOL MOIST SEA-WEEDY ODOUR OF THE COAST
BUT IF THEY DO FIND OUT I'D BETTER HAVE MY TWO BOATS OUT AT SEA AND HE THOUGHT OF HIS LUGGERS LYING IN THE LITTLE CUP-LIKE COVE
HE SAW IT ALL NOW
NO YOU'LL WANT ALL THIS AND I'VE GOT SOME GOOD TACK INSIDE BE OFF FELLOW AND DON'T BOTHER ME YAH
TCHAH
TCHAH
TCHAH
TCHAH
A FIERCE CRY OF RAGE CAME FROM THE MASTER BUT HE WAS QUICK AT GIVING DIRECTIONS CHECKING THE COURSE OF HIS BOAT AND THEN PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY
YES I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING MR GURR SAID ARCHY
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING YELLED ARCHY
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THAT
WE MUST DRAW THE LINE AT MILKING COWS
THAT'S JEMMY DADD SHOUTING FOR ME ARCHY MADE NO REPLY AND THE BOY ROSE SET DOWN THE BASKET BESIDE WHERE HE HAD BEEN KNEELING AND STOOD GAZING DOWN AT THE PRISONER
GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME HE CRIED AS HE STOPPED ABOUT HALF WAY TO THE TRAP-DOOR
IN FACT WHEN HE CLOSED THEM STRANGE AS IT MAY SOUND HE FELT AS IF HE COULD SEE BETTER FOR THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LITTLE SPOTS OF LIGHT SAILING UP AND DOWN AND ROUND AND ROUND LIKE THE TINY SPARKS SEEN IN TINDER BEFORE THE FIRE WHICH HAS CONSUMED IS QUITE EXTINCT
TIS MY NATUR TOO BUT IT SEEMS WERRY HARD TO BE CALLED DIRTY WHEN YOU ARN'T THERE I BEG PARDON DICK AND I WILL NOT CALL YOU SO ANY MORE THANKYE SIR
HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS
STRANGE AND CURIOUS HOW A NAME O THAT KIND STICKS OH I SAY DON'T TALK SO SAID THE LAD BY THE ROUGH SAILOR'S SIDE
I SAY IS THE DOOR LOCKED AS WELL AS BOLTED I CANNOT TELL
WHAT'S THAT HE SEIZED THE SAILOR BY THE SHOULDER AND POINTED WHERE SOME FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY CLOSE UNDER THE CLIFF BUT ON THE RISE OF THE LINE OF BREAKERS THERE WAS SOMETHING SWIMMING SLOWLY ALONG
AND THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HE WONDERED WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO
AT LAST TO HIS GREAT RELIEF RAM UTTERED A DEEP SIGH AND SAT UP SMILING AT HIS COMPANION
IF EVER THE LOUD BAYING OF A DOG SOUNDED LIKE MUSIC IN HIS EAR IT WAS DURING THOSE BRIEF MOMENTS AND AS HE SAT THERE LONGING TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT AND WHETHER HIS CONJECTURE WAS RIGHT THAT THE DOG HAD SCENTED HIM OUT HE FAINTLY HEARD THE GRUFF TONES OF A VOICE AND HASTILY DESCENDING HE WENT DOWN THE SLOPE AND MADE FOR HIS USUAL PLACE
I'LL GO AND GET THE BASKET AY DO BOY
FATHER NEVER HAD NOTHING THERE NOT EVEN A KEG
ALWAYS THE SAME ANSWER
NOW THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO ASHORE TRY AND FIND MR RAYSTOKE SIR
NOW THEN BRING HIM ALONG HIS HAND WAS GRASPED AND AS HE FELT HIMSELF LED OVER GROUND THAT WAS QUITE FAMILIAR NOW HE KNEW THAT HE WAS ON THE WAY TO THE ENTRANCE
BUT I MUST SAY IT'S VERY RUDE PRAY FORGIVE US SAID ARCHY RAISING HIS HAT
AND JUBILANT WITH THE DISCOVERY THE MEN RETURNED ON BOARD DREAMING OF PRIZE-MONEY BUT NOT UNTIL A STRONG GUARD HAD BEEN LEFT OVER THE PLACE IN CASE ANY OF THE WASPS SHOULD RETURN
HIS HEART BEAT HIGH AS HE THOUGHT OF THE LIEUTENANT'S DELIGHT AND OF THE JOY THERE WOULD BE AMONGST THE MEN FOR THIS WOULD MEAN PRIZE-MONEY AND PERHAPS THE MEANS OF DELUDING THE VESSEL THAT HAD BROUGHT THE CARGO INTO A TRAP SO THAT IT COULD BE CAPTURED AND MORE PRIZE-MONEY AS WELL AS HONOUR BE THE RESULT
IS JEMMY HERE NO BUT DID YOU CLIMB UP AND GET A ROPE AND COME DOWN AGAIN AND HAUL ME ON HERE YES SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN
LISTEN WHISPERED ARCHY
THE PART OF THE CLIFF FOR WHICH HE MADE WAS EXACTLY OPPOSITE SIR RISDON'S OLD HOUSE AND TO A STRANGER ABOUT THE LAST PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE DEEMED POSSIBLE FOR A SMUGGLER TO LAND HIS CARGO
AND I FOUND IT OUT
AFTER WHICH AS HE COULD SEE THAT THE LIEUTENANT WAS BUSY WITH HIS GLASS HE WAITED HIS OPPORTUNITY GOT A COW BETWEEN HIM AND THE SEA AND THEN WITH RAISED STICK BEGAN TO DRIVE THE CATTLE FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE PRECIPICE HIS ACTION SEEMING PERFECTLY NATURAL AND RAISING NO SUSPICION IN THE OFFICER'S BREAST
BUT AS A GENTLEMAN I'M AFRAID I THINK I SHOULD HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME I'M VERY SORRY SIR
WHY WHERE'S THE BOAT CRIED ARCHY EXCITEDLY AS HE SWEPT THE FACE OF THE CLIFF WITH HIS EYES
DIRTY DICK WAS READY TO TAKE AN OATH TO THAT EFFECT BUT HE WAS NOT ASKED
WHEN THERE WERE NO CROPS GROWING HE WENT TO SEE HOW THE GRASS WAS GETTING ON AND TO DO THIS PROPERLY HE PUT A PIECE OF HARD BLACK TOBACCO IN HIS CHEEK AND WENT AND LAY DOWN ON ONE OF THE HILL-SLOPES
QUIET GRIP SHE SAID IN AN AWE-STRICKEN WHISPER AS SHE WENT DOWN ON HER KNEES AND LISTENED HER HEART BEATING WILDLY AND A HORRIBLE IDEA ALL CONFUSED OF SOME ONE HAVING BEEN BURIED ALIVE MAKING HER FACE TURN ASHY PALE
THE GLOOM WAS SO FAMILIAR TO ARCHY NOW THAT HE COULD GO ALMOST ANYWHERE ABOUT THE GREAT PLACE WITHOUT STUMBLING OVER THE LOOSE FRAGMENTS OF STONE OR BEING IN DANGER OF RUNNING UP AGAINST THE GREAT PILLARS
NOT I
SHE LOOKED ABOUT BEWILDERED BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE ROOM HAVING BEEN OCCUPIED
THIS WAS QUICKLY DONE AND THE LITTLE OFFICER TURNED SHARPLY TO WHERE RAM AND JEMMY DADD WERE SEATED ON THE ROCK LOOKING ON AS STOLIDLY AS IF NOTHING WHATEVER WAS COMING
HI MISSUS HEAR HIM
BUT IT SLOPES UP AND NOT DOWN
THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER IN SOME PUBLIC-HOUSE DRINKING AND GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM US
OPEN THAT DOOR AND LET ME GO BETTER CARRY HIM JEMMY IF YOU DARE CRIED THE ANGRY PRISONER BEGINNING THE STRUGGLE BUT JEMMY DADD'S MUSCLES WERE LIKE STEEL AND HE WHIPPED THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN OFF HIS FEET AND CARRIED HIM KICKING AND STRUGGLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT RIGHT ALONG THE CAVE RAM GOING FIRST WITH THE LANTHORN
THEY WERE TOO CAUTIOUS EVER TO LEAVE THE DOOR UNGUARDED
BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO TUMBLE SO YOU CAN BE OFF ALL THE SAME THOUGH HE SHUDDERED AND HE HAD TO EXERCISE A LITTLE FORCE TO MAKE HIS NEW START DOWNWARD
NEVER MIND THE LIGHTS
OH CAN'T HE SAID RAM QUIETLY
I DON'T WANT TO SEE SHE SAID
YOU AND GURR ACTED SO THAT I'M PROUD OF YOU BOTH AND OF THE LADS
AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU SIR RISDON THE GENTLEMAN STARTED
WEARIED OUT AT LENGTH HE DETERMINED TO GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM WHERE HE WAS TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE VAULT
SUDDENLY ARCHY RECALLED THAT HIS LEGS HAD BEEN BOUND AND HE SAT UP TO FIND THAT THEY WERE FREE NOW AND IF HE LIKED HE COULD RISE AND GO TO THE GRATED WINDOW AND CALL FOR HELP
I MEAN IN THE SEA AND ON THAT ROCK COME THERE SAID RAM WITH A VACANT LOOK
FORTUNATELY IT LODGED AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS DOWN BESIDE IT AND CLOSE AT THE END OF THE GREAT LEDGE GAZING OVER WONDERINGLY AND WITH HIS EYES HALF BLINDED BY A MIST EXPECTING TO SEE THE NARROW SHELF BELOW BARE
GO ON YES SIR
TIME WE HAD SOME NEWS OF HIM EH YES SIR
DO YOU SEE THOSE WHAT THEM TUBS YES SIR NOT TILL YOU GOT EM
WHAT'S THE GOOD?--THEY'D COME ARTER US AND THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY I SAY SHOUTED RAM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ARCHY TURNED TO THE LIEUTENANT
OH HOW I COULD FIGHT BUT THEY RAN UP AGAINST NO SMUGGLERS ON THEIR WAY TO THE BOATS WHICH THEY HAILED FROM THE STRAND WHERE THE WATER WAS VERY LOW
WHO'S GOING TO CHEW TOBACCO CRIED THE LAD WITH A LOOK OF DISGUST AS HE BUTTONED UP HIS UNIFORM JACKET
ROCKS ARE HARDER THAN HEADS
TUMBLED DOWN CONTINUED RAM WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
PERHAPS WE MAY RUN UP AGAINST THE SMUGGLERS AFTER ALL WISH WE MIGHT SAID THE MASTER
THEN HE WAS VERY EAGER TO GET ME TO GO UP YONDER AND THAT LOOKS BAD
THERE IS SEA-COWS I'VE HEARED OH BUT THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM
THERE BEYOND THE FLICKERING POOL OF BLUE AND YELLOW FLAME WHICH WAS RAPIDLY SPREADING IN EVERY DIRECTION HE COULD DIMLY SEE QUITE A WALL OF PILED-UP KEGS ONE OF WHICH LAY RIGHT IN THE EDGE OF THE POOL OF FIRE AND SUDDENLY EXPLODED WITH A DULL REPORT WHICH BLEW THE TONGUES OF FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS HALF EXTINGUISHING THEM FOR THE MOMENT BUT INSTANTANEOUSLY FLASHING OUT AGAIN IN A VOLUME OF FIRE WHICH QUADRUPLED THE SIZE OF THE POOL AND BEGAN TO LICK THE SIDES OF THE KEGS
OF ONE THING HE HAD FULLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AND THAT WAS THE HOPELESSNESS OF GETTING OUT BY THE WAY HIS VISITORS CAME IN
IT'S STRANGE SAID ARCHY ALOUD AS HE SAT THERE THINKING THAT IF HE CHOSE HIS TIME RIGHT HE MIGHT MAKE HIS MEN PULL THE BOAT IN UPON A WAVE LET THEM JUMP OUT AND DRAG HER UP THE ROCKS
I'LL GO AND TELL THE MISSUS
THAT'S JUST CLOSE TO THE COVE AND IF WE KEEP STRAIGHT ON WE SHALL BE IN THE ROAD IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR AND AT THE BOATS TEN MINUTES LATER NO NO MY LAD SAID THE MASTER
THAT'S WHERE I CLIMBED DOWN TO AND WE HAD THE STRUGGLE--THAT BOY AND I NO I CAN'T SEE ANY LEDGES MR RAYSTOKE
SHE'S A BEEF COW AND NOT A MILKER YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BUSINESS MY LAD SAID THE LIEUTENANT
CONSEQUENTLY THE COMING OF THE COW WAS LIKE A HALF-HOLIDAY TO THEM AT THE WRONG END OF THE DAY AND THEY STOOD ABOUT NUDGING EACH OTHER AS DIRTY DICK TROTTED UP WITH HIS BUCKET ARCHY LOOKING ON AS MUCH AMUSED AS THE MEN
MY FATHER SAID IT WAS TRUE SEEN ANY SMUGGLERS CRAFT ABOUT DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS NO SIR
THAT IS TO SAY HE HAD HIS GLASS TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS TROTTING UP AND DOWN HIS CLEANLY HOLYSTONED DECK PAUSING FROM TIME TO TIME TO RAISE HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE AND WATCH THE TOP OF THE CLIFF ENDING BY GAZING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COVE
ESCAPE WITH ME
BUT KNOWING THE DANGER OF THE BOY COMING BACK AND FINDING HIM GONE HE FORCED HIMSELF TO STAY WHERE HE WAS
FIVE MINUTES AFTER THEY CAME UPON FISHERMAN-FARMER SHACKLE HIMSELF LEANING OVER HIS GATE AND SMOKING A PIPE AS HE APPARENTLY CONTEMPLATED A PIG AND WONDERED WHETHER HE OUGHT TO MAKE IT FATTER THAN IT WAS
I SAY YOUNG RAM HE CRIED WHAT A GAME WHAT'S A GAME SAID THE BOY SHARPLY
TARNT A PORPUS HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
WHY I'M NOT SHUT UP HE CRIED JOYOUSLY
I SHALL DROP OVER THE SIDE WHERE IT'S ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP
I SAW YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR LIFE IF I DID NOT GET A ROPE AND COME TO YOU AND SO I DID IT YES
DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE COW AWAY AGEN DO EE LOOK HERE MY LAD ONE OF OUR BOYS IS MISSING
STOP THEM DICK
COME HERE SIR
ALL REGRETS WERE VAIN NOW AND HE KEPT ON FOLLOWING THE CRIES HE HEARD FIRST IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN IN ANOTHER TILL AT LAST AFTER A WEARY STRUGGLE THROUGH A GREAT PATCH OF BRAMBLES AND STONES HE FOUND HIMSELF QUITE ALONE AND LEFT BEHIND
TALK ABOUT BLIND MAN'S BUFF
AS A LITTLE FAT ROSY FELLOW THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY THOUGHT NOT
AND AS TO A FEW MUSHROOMS WHY YOU'RE WELCOME ENOUGH
HE THOUGHT ALL THIS OVER AGAIN AS HE SAT THERE WEARIED OUT AND DESPONDENT FOR IN THE MORNING HIS TASK HAD SEEMED AS GOOD AS ACHIEVED AND NOW HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE FACT AFTER ALL THAT LABOUR THAT IT HAD BEEN IN VAIN AND HE WAS MORE A PRISONER THAN EVER
WHAT WAS I DOING YES TO RUN SUCH A RISK I WAS--I WAS RAM WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN ABACK AND SAT STARING WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN
THERE CRIED RAM AND SNATCHING UP THE ONE HE HAD BROUGHT HE WALKED STRAIGHT AWAY SWINGING HIS LANTHORN AFTER HE HAD SHUT IT WITH A SNAP
NO THUNDERED THE LIEUTENANT
AS HE CREPT SLOWLY ON STEP BY STEP THESE AND SIMILAR THOUGHTS CAME RAPIDLY THROUGH THE PRISONER'S BRAIN AND AS HE SLOWLY MOUNTED WHAT SEEMED TO BE A PILE OF FRAGMENTS HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE HIS PRISON COULD BE--WHETHER IT WAS CLOSE TO THE SHORE OR SOME DISTANCE INLAND
WON'T BE SO FOGGY THOUGH AS TWAS LAST NOTHING WAS SEEN OR HEARD OF THE LATE PRISONERS BOAT AND FOR VERY GOOD REASONS
HAH EJACULATED ARCHY IN A SIGH OF RELIEF
WHO WOULDN'T BE HUNGRY FETCHED OUT OF HIS COT AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING TO TAKE THE WATCH
THE PROBABILITIES ARE THAT HE WILL EITHER HAVE THE PECULIAR FORM OF DREAM KNOWN AS NIGHTMARE OR SOME TIME IN THE NIGHT HE WILL GET OUT OF BED AND GO WANDERING ABOUT HIS ROOM IN THE DARKNESS TO AWAKE AT LAST COLD CONFUSED AND ASKING HIMSELF WHERE HE IS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST ABILITY TO GIVE A REASONABLE ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
AND THE LIEUTENANT RAISED HIS GLASS TO SWEEP THE COAST
THE FIRING KEPT ON THE DULL THUD OF THE GUN BEING PRECEDED BY THE FLASH AND AT EACH NOTIFICATION OF A SHOT THE MEN GAVE SUCH A TUG AT THE STOUT ASH BLADES THAT THEY BENT AND THE BOAT LEAPED THROUGH THE WATER
BUT I MEANT TO FETCH YOU BACK
MOTHER USED TO SEND ME AND SHE OFTEN USED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WAS MOST STARVED TO DEATH THEN SIR RISDON DIDN'T GET ANYTHING BY THE SMUGGLING HIM CRIED RAM
VERY CHAPTER EIGHT
YOU SHALL MAKE A GOOD MEAL AND THEN HAVE A SLEEP READY FOR TO-MORROW'S WORK
FOR THE LIEUTENANT'S ANXIETY ABOUT THE YOUNG OFFICER OF THE WHITE HAWK WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE CONTAGIOUS AND THE MEN GAVE A CHEER AS THEY SPAN THE BOAT ALONG EVERY SMART SAILOR ON BOARD THINKING ABOUT THE FRANK STRAIGHTFORWARD LAD WHO HAD SO BRAVELY GONE ON THE RISKY EXPEDITION
IT'S ALL A STOPPER HERE THEN OUT YOU COME MY LAD SAID THE MASTER
OH COME I LIKES THAT
WELL RAYSTOKE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING SAID A VOICE BEHIND HIM AND HE STARTED ROUND
LOOKIN AFTER A LOST SHEEP CAME IN A DEEP GROWL FROM UNDER JEMMY DADD'S HAT
BUT I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE THING HOW TO GET AWAY NO GOOD TO THINK ABOUT THAT
YES SIR BUT HE IS NOT A DESERTER
I SAY FARMER HE SAID AS HE TASTED THIS IS THE RIGHT SORT OR THE WRONG SORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SIDE YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE DROP GIVEN ME BY A FRIEND FRENCH FRIEND FOR ANY MONEY SAID THE MASTER DRINKING THE GLASS
I'M MOST SURE OF IT NOW RIGHT IT WAS AS WAS PROVED A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER BY THEIR STRIKING THE ROUGH ROAD AT RIGHT ANGLES AND THERE A HALT WAS CALLED
BUT SHE'S SUCH A SAVAGE ONE SIR
THE WEAPON WAS GONE
THE ONE THE KING'S MEN HAD DRAGGED DRIPPING FROM THE SEA BORE CERTAIN UNMISTAKABLE MARKINGS AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY BROTHER TO THOSE ON THE ROCK
HAH CRIED THE LIEUTENANT JOYFULLY
I DO LIKE YOU GET OUT AH YOU MAY SAY THAT BUT I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NOW THEN LET ME GO CEPT THAT KNOCK ME ON THE HEAD THEN AND PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY AND CEPT THAT TOO
HE ALIGHTED ON HIS FEET AND SCRATCHED AND STARTLED A BIT STOOD PANTING AND TRYING TO RECOVER HIS COMPOSURE
NOW MR RAYSTOKE MIDSHIPMAN SAID THE LIEUTENANT MERRILY
STEADY MY LAD STEADY STEADY IT IS SAID ANOTHER VOICE
BUT ALL THIS PASSED OFF AND EXERTING HIS STRENGTH AS FAR AS HE COULD IN THE TERRIBLY DANGEROUS CRIPPLED POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS HE GAVE THREE OR FOUR SHARP JERKS AND SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING RAM WELL ON TO THE SHELF WHEN IN THE REVULSION OF FEELING THE DIZZINESS CAME BACK AND HE FELT THAT HE MUST FAINT
BUT YOU'LL SAY WE FOUND YOU AND ALL THAT
THEN THEY ARE CRIED THE GIRL WITH HER HANDSOME YOUNG FACE PUCKERING UP WITH THE TROUBLE WHICH OPPRESSED HER AND AFTER STANDING LOOKING THOUGHTFUL AND ANXIOUS FOR A FEW MOMENTS SHE WENT AWAY TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHILE RAM WENT ROUND TO THE SIDE AND DELIVERED HIS BASKET
THEY'LL BE ON THE WATCH AND IF THEY SEE A BOAT'S CREW LAND THEY'LL DO NOTHING TO-NIGHT THEN WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE DON'T LAUGH AT ME SIR AND CALL ME STUPID
IT SEEMED SO PROBABLE THAT A NERVOUS FEELING ATTACKED THE LAD
MILKING COWS WON'T DO
NOW SIR SAID THE LIEUTENANT HAUGHTILY WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS THE MAN LEANED FORWARD AND THERE WAS A LEER ON HIS BEARDED FACE SEEN BY THE DULL SWINGING OIL-LAMP AS HALF COVERING HIS MOUTH HE WHISPERED HOARSELY BEHIND HIS HANDS LIKE HOLLANDS GIN MASTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
THEN HE SEEMED TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF AND STARTED UP TO GAZE UP THEN OVER THE SIDE AT THE SEA FAR BELOW AND LASTLY AT HIS COMPANION IN MISFORTUNE
HERE DICK AND YOU HE SAID IN SHORT QUICK DECISIVE TONES AS HE LAY DOWN AND LOOKED OVER
WELL WE'LL SEE HE WENT ON MUNCHING A LITTLE LONGER THEN FELT FOR THE BOTTLE TOOK OUT THE TIGHT CORK HAD A GOOD LONG DRAUGHT OF THE MILK IT CONTAINED RECORKED AND PUT IT AWAY IN THE BASKET WITH THE BREAD BUTTER AND HAM HE HAD NOT CONSUMED SHUT DOWN THE LID AND LAUGHED
MORNIN GENTLEMEN HE SAID AS ARCHY AND THE MASTER CAME UP AND HALTED THEIR MEN
BUT SLOPED RIGHT UNDER AND TRY AS HE WOULD HE COULD DEVISE NO PLAN FOR GETTING DOWN LOWER SAVE BY TAKING A HEADER INTO THE SEA WHERE THE WATER LOOKED BLACK AND DEEP TO HIS RIGHT WHILE TO HIS LEFT THERE WAS THE CHASM UPON WHICH TWENTY FEET OR SO OUT OF THE PERPENDICULAR LINE WAS THE HOLE FROM WHICH HE HAD COME
WHERE IS IT WHERE I PUT IT
PAST GLISTENING WHITE MUSHROOMS BETTER THAN ANY SHE HAD YET SEEN BUT THEY DID NOT ATTRACT HER
PUT YOU UP THERE IN SUCH A FOG AS WE'VE HAD AND WHERE WOULD YOU BE FAST ASLEEP IN THE FIRST SNUG CORNER I COULD FIND SAID THE SAILOR AS THE MIDSHIPMAN RAN AFT AND DESCENDED INTO THE CABIN TO GO TO THE END AND TAP ON A DOOR
HOW TIME SLIPS BY YES SIR SAID LIEUTENANT ARCHY RAYSTOKE RETURNING THE GLASS
DO YOU WANT TO GO RAM SHOOK HIS HEAD
OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW THIS GAVE THE MIDSHIPMAN A MOMENT'S BREATHING TIME
HERE GO IN AND GET THE LANTHORNS NOW AT THAT MOMENT ARCHY WAS BROUGHT UP BY A WALL OVER WHICH HE PASSED HIS HANDS TO FIND THAT HE WAS DIRECTLY AFTER TOUCHING IRON BARS CLOSE TO THE GROUND
SO RAISING HIS HANDS TO THEIR FULL EXTENT HE FOUND A PLACE FOR ONE FOOT THEN FOR THE OTHER REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT AND WAS JUST GOING TO DRAW HIMSELF UP TO A LEDGE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HE HAD JUST LEFT WHEN ONE FOOT SLIPPED FROM THE STONE UPON WHICH IT RESTED AND HAD THE LAD LOST HIS NERVE HE MUST HAVE FALLEN HEADLONG
HERE MATE HE CONTINUED DROPPING ON ONE KNEE GIVE US YOUR PAW THE DOG A STURDY-LOOKING DEERHOUND GROWLED AND CLOSED UP TO HIS MISTRESS
I WANT TO DESTROY THIS WASPS NEST BUT IN AS MERCIFUL A WAY AS POSSIBLE
NEVER KNOW ME GO CHATTERING ABOUT LUGGERS DO YOU NO FATHER THEN SET YOUR TEETH HARD OR YOU'LL NEVER BE A MAN WORTH YOUR SALT
WHY IT COMES RIGHT OVER UP NIGH THE TOP
AND THEN IN SILENCE THEY BORE THEIR INSENSIBLE CHILD INTO THE FORBIDDING-LOOKING HOUSE
BY THE TIME SHE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SECOND FLIGHT SHE WAS READY AND QUITE HOPEFUL AND WITH THE TEARS STANDING IN HER EYES SHE FELT SURE THAT THE FRANK GENTLEMANLY LAD WOULD BE MERCIFUL FORGIVE HER AND SAVE HER FATHER FROM A TERRIBLE DISGRACE
WHERE DO YOU LIVE YONDER AT THE FARM OH
I CAN'T HELP IT LOOKIN BROWN
WELL WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO GO ASHORE AND WATCH OF COURSE
RAYSTOKE LOOKED ROUND HIM FOR A WEAPON BUT THE ONLY THING VISIBLE WAS A STONE AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO DESCEND TO SUCH A BARBAROUS MEANS OF OFFENCE OR DEFENCE HE DREW HIMSELF UP BURNING WITH INDIGNATION BUT WAITING FOR THE OTHERS TO COMMENCE SPEAKING
HE SET DOWN HIS LANTHORNS TWO ABOUT FIVE FEET APART LIT THEM ALL AND HELD THE THIRD ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AS HE STOOD BETWEEN THE OTHERS SO THAT FROM SEAWARD THE LIGHTS WOULD HAVE APPEARED LIKE A TRIANGLE
YOU CAN GO BELOW RAM WAVED HIS RED CAP TOSSED IT IN THE AIR AND TURNED TO ARCHY
THEY'RE OBLIGED TO DO IT
THIS PROVED TO BE THE CASE THE PEOPLE GETTING NEARER AND NEARER AND IT WAS A CURIOUS EXPERIENCE TO HEAR THE WHISPERING OF VOICES AND TRAMPLING OF FEET COMING OUT OF THE DARKNESS
BRING YOUR LANTHORN I'VE KETCHED A RAT OR SOME'AT
THE BOY HAD BEEN BAITING HIM TO ROUSE HIM TO ATTACK AND HE WAS DOUBLY A PRISONER NOW HELD FAST AGAINST THE BARS SO THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN WRENCH ROUND HIS HEAD AS HE HEARD THE DOOR BEHIND HIM OPENED WHILE AS HE OPENED HIS MOUTH TO CRY FOR HELP A GREAT ROUGH HAND WAS PLACED OVER HIS EYES PRESSING HIS HEAD BACK A HANDKERCHIEF WAS JAMMED BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND AS HE HEARD A DEEP GROWLING VOICE SAY HOLD HIM TIGHT A ROPE WAS DRAWN ABOUT HIS CHEST PINIONING HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES AND ANOTHER SECURED HIS ANKLES
HOW DARE YOU
HE WASN'T LONG IN MAKING THESE PLANS AND WHEN THE COVE WAS REACHED THE TWO FISHING LUGGERS AND ANOTHER BOAT OR TWO LYING THERE WERE CAREFULLY OVERHAULED GURR GAZING AT THE MEN ON BOARD LIKE A FIERCE DOG AND LITERALLY WORRYING THE DIFFERENT FISHERMEN AS CLEVERLY AS A CROSS-EXAMINING COUNSEL WOULD A WITNESS ASHORE
CHAPTER FOUR
PANELS EVERYWHERE BUT NO MEANS OF ESCAPE AND HE WENT AGAIN TO STAND AT THE WINDOW TO BEMOAN HIS STUPIDITY FOR ALLOWING A WEAK GIRL TO MAKE A PRISONER OF HIM IN SO ABSURD A WAY
THINK SHE'LL COME TO-NIGHT YOUNG RAM SAID THE MAN CLOSE BY HIM
I KNOW HAH CRIED GURR AS AN ECHOING BANG RAN THROUGH THE GREAT CAVERN
STOP A MINUTE MR GURR
I THINK I COULD MILK HER SIR SAID ARCHY
THIS IS THE CHRONICLE OF THE EXPEDITION OF THE WHITE HAWK TO CRUSH THE SMUGGLING ON THE FREESTONE SHORE THE MOST FAMOUS PLACE FOR THE DOINGS OF THOSE WHO SET THE KING'S LAWS AT DEFIANCE
BUT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH HIS FIRST ESSAY HIS VOICE GOING ECHOING AWAY APPARENTLY FOR A GREAT DISTANCE AND THE PECULIAR DYING WHISPERING SOUND WAS NOT PLEASANT TO ONE ALONE IN THE DARKNESS
SURE NONE OF THE LADS CHUCKED ANYTHING ASIDE THE PATH WHEN THEY RAN UP YES FATHER
CAN'T HELP IT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THERE THEY ARE HE WAS RIGHT THE ROUGH PIECES OF STONE WERE BEING REMOVED AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE SAW THE SWINGING LAMP COMING THROUGH THE GLOOM
IT IS DISHONOURABLE AND THE ACT IS A BREAKING OF THE LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY TCHAH
ARCHY'S FIRST IMPULSE AS HE RECOVERED HIMSELF A LITTLE IN THE SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED WAS TO TURN OPEN THE DOOR AND FLEE
SILENCE HE SAID THE LAST WORDS HASTILY FOR THE CREW MADE NOISE ENOUGH TO STARTLE ANY ONE WITHIN RANGE AND THE SOUND
BUT I'M A KING'S OFFICER YOUNG AS I AM AND I'LL SHOW THEM THAT I CAN FIGHT FOR MY LIFE LIKE A MAN AS THIS THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HIS HAND WENT INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS SIDE TO GET A GOOD GRIP OF AND DRAW HIS DIRK
I'LL STAY NOW IF YOU LIKE
IN ANY CASE THE LIEUTENANT MEANT TO BE ON THE ALERT AND HENCE THE SAILING OF THE CUTTER
THERE THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO WHEN WE WERE ON DECK
THANK'EE
NOW SIR CRIED THE LIEUTENANT TURNING UPON HIM SHARPLY HAVE THE GOODNESS TO EXPLAIN YOUR CONDUCT
LOOK THERE
LOOK THERE
GET UP ARCHY LEAPED TO HIS FEET AND SAW AT A GLANCE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SUN BUT THE LIGHT OF A LANTHORN SHINING IN HIS EYES WHILE BEFORE HE COULD DO MORE THAN REALISE THAT SEVERAL MEN WERE STANDING CLOSE TO HIM HALF OF A SACK WAS DRAWN-DOWN OVER HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND A THIN ROPE WAS TWISTED ROUND AND ROUND HIS ARMS FASTENING HIM SECURELY AND ONLY LEAVING HIS HANDS FREE
AND IF HE COULD ENLARGE THAT CRACK THERE WOULD BE A WAY OUT TO THE FACE OF THE ROCKS WHERE IT WOULD GO HARD WITH HIM INDEED IF HE COULD NOT CLIMB UP TO THE GRASSY FIELDS ABOVE OR DOWN TO THE SHORE BELOW
GETTING HUNGRY YES SAID ARCHY IN A VOICE HE WISHED TO SOUND SURLY AND OBSTINATE BUT WHICH IN SPITE OF HIS WISHES HAD A CHEERFUL RING WHICH AFFECTED RAM WHO BEGAN TO LAUGH AND CHATTER
ANGRY BUT TREMBLING WITH DREAD CELIA HAD HURRIED UP TO HER OWN ROOM TO TRY AND THINK WHAT WAS BEST TO BE DONE
BUT HE HELD ON TIGHTLY WAITED A MINUTE TO LET THE JARRING SENSATION PASS AWAY DEPENDING UPON HIS HANDS AND ONE FOOT
AND PERHAPS IN A FEW MINUTES THE SMUGGLER WOULD HAVE BEEN COMING INTO THE LITTLE BAY I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER REDEEMED MY REPUTATION BEEN LOOKED UPON AS A SMART OFFICER MY CREW WOULD HAVE GOT A NICE BIT OF PRIZE MONEY AND THE FELLOW WOULD HAVE COME STEALTHILY SOME NIGHT FOR HIS REWARD.--I'VE DONE WRONG
FORWARD RIGHT MY LADS AND LET'S MAKE THE BEST OF IT NEVER MIND MR GURR SAID ARCHY IN A LOW VOICE
HERE JEMMY TAKE HOLD OF THE PAINTER AND COME ABOARD STOP CRIED THE LIEUTENANT YOU MUST NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT
ARCHY DARE NOT SPEAK
IF THE MEN SEEM ALL RIGHT AND HONEST AS TO WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO SEE IF YOU CAN GET ANY INFORMATION BUT BE ON YOUR GUARD AS THEY'LL SEND YOU PERHAPS ON SOME FOOL'S ERRAND AY AY SIR CRIED ARCHY AGAIN AS HE TOOK THE HANDLE OF THE TILLER
ONLY HEIGH-HO-HA
THE FARM-BOY TRIES SO HARD TO BE KIND TO THE MIDSHIPMAN WHO IS SO RUDE IN RETURN
I'M HALF ASLEEP NOW NEVER MIND THAT
RAM HAD NOT MOVED AND THERE WAS YET TIME
YOU WON'T MIND OLD GAL SO LONG AS THEY DON'T RIP OPEN THE BEDS AND CHUCK THE FURNITURE ALL OVER THE PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THEM DOING IT THAT'S ALL CRIED MRS SHACKLE RUFFLING UP LIKE A GREAT DORKING HEN WHO SAW A HAWK
JUMP UP MR RAYSTOKE AND SIGNAL THE BO'S'N TO COME ON
LOWERING SAIL SIR SAID DIRTY DICK WHO WAS PULLING FIRST OAR
THAT WILL DO BOY
THE CUTTER'S BOAT WAS GOING FAST AND THE SECOND BOAT WAS CLOSING UP SO THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SMUGGLERS TO ESCAPE BY SEA
OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER BOY
THEN HE SHOUTED TO THE MAN IN THE BOAT HI
I SHOULDN'T LIKE IT AND THAT'S WHY I GET MOTHER TO GIVE ME ALL SORTS O GOOD THINGS TO BRING FOR YOU AND SAVE EM UP
COME WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO DO
IF SHE REALLY DID SEE THAT THE KEGS WOULD BE GONE
I WANTED TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND YOU LET YOUR AMIABILITY STEP IN THE WAY SIR
I LOATHE THE WHOLE BUSINESS BUT WHEN I SAW MY WIFE AND CHILD SUFFERING ALMOST FROM WANT OF THE VERY NECESSARIES OF LIFE AND THE TEMPTATION CAME IN THE SHAPE OF PRESENTS FROM THAT MAN I COULD NOT RESIST--I WAS TOO WEAK
WE SHALL CATCH HIM NEVER YOU FEAR THAT
BUT I AM JUSTLY PUNISHED AND NEVER AGAIN WILL I ALLOW MYSELF TO BE MADE AN ACCESSORY TO THESE LAWLESS DEEDS BUT TELL ME SHE WHISPERED HAVE THEY ANY OF THEIR GOODS SECRETED THERE NOW I DO NOT KNOW YOU DO NOT KNOW NO
ARE YOU ALL THERE CRIED ARCHY
THE LANTHORN HE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY AND PLANNING AT ONCE HOW HE COULD STRIKE A LIGHT WITH A STONE AND HIS KNIFE AND PERHAPS CONTRIVE SOME TINDER HE WENT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES FEELING ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS TILL HE TOUCHED THE OBJECT WHICH HE HAD KICKED AND UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND EXCITEMENT
LOOK OUT JEMMY
HOW DARE HE ARCHY DREW HIMSELF UP LAID ONE HAND UPON HIS DIRK AND STRUTTED UP TO RAM LOOKING AS BIG AS A SMALL OSSIFER AS DIRTY DICK SAID AFTERWARDS
BUT HE WAS REMINDED THAT IT WAS NO DREAM FROM TIME TO TIME BY FEELING A HAND LAID DEPRECATINGLY UPON HIS BRUISED ARM AND STARTING ROUND TO SEE IN THE DARKNESS THAT IT WAS DIRTY DICK WHO PATTED HIS INJURY GENTLY AND THEN UTTERED A SATISFIED HAH PLEASED TO SEE ME BACK THOUGHT THE MIDSHIPMAN BUT I WISH HE WOULDN'T PAT ME AS IF I WERE A DOG HULLO EXCLAIMED THE MASTER JUST THEN AS THEY CAME OPPOSITE A DEPRESSION IN THE CLIFF WHICH GAVE THEM A VIEW OUT TO SEA
I BELIEVE IT'S A REAL COW DICK NOT SHE SIR
MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
NAY NOT ME
LOVELY HE SAID ALOUD AS HE FORGOT IN THE GLORY OF THE SCENE THE DISCOMFORT HE HAD FELT
I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE LISTENED TO YOU
AND AFTER A GLANCE ROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE WHERE THE POOR BEAST COULD BE LANDED ARCHIE GAVE THE ORDER FOR THEM TO ROW BACK TO WHERE THE CUTTER LAY IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE FIVE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE SHORE
AND THEN BEGAN A STRUGGLE WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE BLOOD OF AN ONLOOKER CURDLE SO TERRIBLY NARROW AND DANGEROUS WAS THE PLACE WHERE THE ENCOUNTER TOOK PLACE
KNEW YOU WERE TOO MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN BUT I WAS STUFFED FULL OF THOUGHTS LIKE THAT AND THEY WOULD COME OUT
HER FATHER'S DISAPPOINTED AND IMPOVERISHED LIFE CONSEQUENT UPON HIS POLITICAL OPINIONS AND HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS AND DEPRESSION HAD MADE THE HOZE ALWAYS A MOURNFUL HOME AND NATURALLY THIS HAD AFFECTED HER MAKING HER A SERIOUS CONTEMPLATIVE GIRL OLDER THAN HER YEARS AND ONE WHO FOUND HER PLEASURE IN SITTING ON A FALLEN TRUNK IN THE SHELTERING WOODS LISTENING TO THE ROAR OF THE WIND IN THE PINE BOUGHS WATCHING THE BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS AND HAVING FOR COMPANION HER DOG GRIP WHO WHEN SHE TOOK HIM FOR HER WALKS GENERALLY RAN MAD FOR THE FIRST HOUR SCAMPERING ROUND AND ROUND HER MAKING CHARGES AT HER FEET AND PRETENDING TO WORRY HER SHOES OR DRESS
YES I WILL HELP YOU CRIED CELIA PLACING HER FACE CLOSE DOWN TO THE STONES
IT WAS QUITE RIGHT FOR FARMER SHACKLE WAS SHOUTING NOW YOU RAMILLIES ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP THERE ALL DAY CHAPTER SIX
NOW THEN WILL YOU ANSWER I DID ANSWER SAID RAM MEEKLY
BUT IT DID NOT LOOK POSSIBLE
YOU COULD HAVE SEEN IT THERE I COULD NOT TELL WITHOUT SEEING IT CLOSE IN SIR
HULLO YOUNG FELLOW HULLO ORFICER YOU MUST NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT SAID ARCHY AS HE ENCOUNTERED RAM ON DECK NEXT MORNING WHISTLING SOFTLY AS HE NEATLY COILED DOWN A ROPE
IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT AND THE YOUTH FELT DISPOSED TO TAKE TO HIS HEELS AND RUN FOR PROTECTION TO HIS MEN
NO MY LAD HE WOULD SAY THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IM THERE AND THEN WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN BUT HIS EYES EAGERLY SEARCHING THE ROAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE HE WENT ON TOWARDS SHACKLE'S FARM
SHE HAS A LOT OF MEN ON BOARD THE DIRECTION OF THE SECOND BOAT WAS ALTERED AT ONCE THE MEN BEGAN TO PULL HARD
THESE GREAT PLACES WOULD PUZZLE A MONKEY AND WE SHAN'T FIND THE HOLE UNLESS WE COME BY DAYLIGHT AND LEAVE A BOAT OFF-SHORE TO SIGNAL TO US TILL WE GET OVER THE SPOT WHAT'S THAT CRIED ARCHY EXCITEDLY AS ONE OF THE MEN ON HIS LEFT UTTERED A SHARP LOOK OUT SHEEP I THINK SIR NO IT WAS A DOG SAID ANOTHER
IT WAS BY ACCIDENT I CAME INTO THIS ROOM
AN HOUR LATER JUST AS HE WAS THINKING OF GOING TO THE OPENING TO SIT THERE AND LOOK OUT AT THE EVENING SKY HE DROPPED OFF FAST ASLEEP AND WAS WAKENED BY THE COMING OF TWO OF THE SMUGGLERS WHO BUSIED THEMSELVES IN THE REPAIRS OF THE BROKEN WALL
THEY JUST ARE POOR
HOW DARE YOU BREAK INTO OUR HOUSE
A DOZEN STRIDES SPLASHING UP BLUE FIRE AT EVERY STEP AND HE WAS THROUGH IT AND WHERE A FAINT CURRENT OF COLD AIR SEEMED TO BE MEETING HIM
WELL THEY HAVE NOT KILLED ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO START UP IN HORROR FOR HE KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE GONE TO STEEP DURING HIS WATCH AND HIS PAIN AND STIFFNESS WERE LIKE A PUNISHMENT FOR DOING SO DISGRACEFUL A THING
AND IF I DON'T FORGET YOU AS I DID MY RABBITS ONCE AND THEY WERE STARVED TO DEATH I'LL BRING YOU SOME MORE.--I SAY ARCHY LOOKED AT HIM FIERCELY
HE'S WAITING YONDER FOR YOU
HE COULD ONLY DIMLY SEE THIS FOR THE LIGHT WAS BUT FEEBLE AND THE BEARER HIDDEN BEHIND THE RUGGED PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ROOF
HULLO WHAT YOU BEEN DOING TO YOUR HANDS ARCHY STARTED GUILTILY AND LOOKED AT THEM IN THE LIGHT TO SEE THAT THEY WERE COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM INJURIES THAT HE HAD MADE UNCONSCIOUSLY IN TOILING WITH HIS KNIFE AGAINST THE STONES
HE BITTERLY REGRETTED NOW NOT HAVING TRIED TO TIME RAM'S VISITS FORGETTING THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO WITHOUT LIGHT AND UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE TO THE EXTENT OF WAITING TILL HE CAME AGAIN AND WATCHING FOR NIGHT FROM THEN HE WENT TO WORK TO TRY AND LOOSEN A STONE BY THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE AND TOILED AWAY TILL AT THE END OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE TWO HOURS THE LIGHT THROUGH THE CREVICE PALED GREW DULL THEN DARK AND FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY DAYS HE KNEW THAT IT WAS NIGHT
YOU'RE SURE THEY'RE KEEPING GOOD WATCH AT THE COVE YES FATHER WHAT SORT OF AN OFFICER DID HE SEEM ON THE CUTTER LITTLE FAT SLEEPY CHAP AND THE OTHERS DON'T SEEM TO BE NO OTHERS ONLY THAT COCKY-HOOPY MIDDY WHO CAME ASHORE WITH THE MEN
BE KIND NOW TO MY SON IF RAM TURNS OUT A GOOD LAD MRS SHACKLE HE SHALL NEVER WANT A ARCHY WAS GOING TO SAY FRIEND BUT HE COULD NOT FOR MRS SHACKLE HAD THROWN HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK IN A BIG MOTHERLY HUG FROM WHICH THE YOUNG OFFICER ESCAPED RED-FACED AND VEXED
THE DOG TRIED AGAIN TO LEAD HER AWAY TOWARD THE SEA BUT SHE WAS INEXORABLE
SHE'S SAILING TWO KNOTS TO OUR ONE
THERE WERE NO LIGHTS AND A COUPLE OF MEN HAD TO BE DESPATCHED TO THE FARM FROM WHENCE THEY RETURNED WITH FOUR LANTHORNS WHICH HAD OFTEN BEEN USED FOR SIGNALS
THAT'S A FLOGGING FOR YOU IF SHE ISN'T FOUND NO NO MASTER
COME ON CRIED RAM
FOR THE MOST PART PRUDENCE FORCED THEM TO KEEP WELL IN BUT AT TIMES THEY HAD SOME ARDUOUS CLIMBS AND WALKED ALONG THE SIDES OF SLOPES OF THIN SHORT GRASS COVERED WITH TINY SNAILS WHOSE SHELLS CRUSHED BENEATH THEIR FEET WITH A PECULIAR CRISP SOUND
THERE WAS AN ARDUOUS TASK BEFORE HIM AND HIS NERVES WERE UNSTRUNG
HE WAS NOT ON THE SEASHORE
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GET YOU ARCHY WAS MOVED BY THE LAD'S FRIENDLY ADVANCES BUT HE FELT AS IF HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN SHOW IT AND HE TURNED IMPATIENTLY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT SHED BY THE LANTHORN
EASY IN THAT BOAT HE SHOUTED
SIX MILES ROW BEFORE YOU CAN FIND A PLACE TO LAND VERY AWKWARD BUT THEY HAVE TO FIND A PLACE TO LAND THEIR SPIRITS MR GURR AND IF WE DON'T SOON HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW WE SHALL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT VERY UNLUCKY SIR
THEY MUST BE BUT THEY'RE HIDING SO AS TO TRY TO ESCAPE OR ELSE TO TAKE US AT A DISADVANTAGE WELL SAID GURR LET THEM
WHERE WILL YOU BEGIN FIRST--WHAT ARE YOU SARCHING FOR BRANDY SAID ARCHY
AS THE MIDSHIPMAN REACHED THE DECK IT WAS TO FIND THAT THERE WAS A LIGHT MIST ON THE WATER AND THAT THE LIEUTENANT WAS AT THE SIDE WITH GURR WHERE THEY WERE WATCHING A BOAT COMING IN FROM SEAWARD
GRIP BARKED FIERCELY
AT LAST AS HE STOOD THERE IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW TERRIFIED TOO MUCH TO STIR HE SUDDENLY HEARD A FAINT SOUND AS OF CATCHING BREATH AND A VOICE SAID IN A HURRIED FRIGHTENED WHISPER WHO'S THERE
THE RABBIT BURROWS WERE ALL VERY WELL BUT HE COULD NEVER GET IN THEM BEYOND HIS SHOULDERS WHILE IN THESE HOLES HE COULD PENETRATE AS FAR AS HE LIKED IN SEARCH OF IMAGINARY WILD CREATURES WHICH WERE NEVER FOUND
IF SO WE SHALL BE ON THE SPOT WON'T YOU GO AT ONCE ARCHY VENTURED TO OBSERVE
I'VE NO CAUSE TO FRET NOW HE HAS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NAVY CONTINUED THE LIEUTENANT
HE WAS MET BY A COMFORTABLE-LOOKING RUDDY-FACED WOMAN WHO SHOUTED,--"WHAT IS IT RAM WHEN HE WAS FIFTY YARDS AWAY
WANT ANYTHING ELSE NO REPLY
AS HE LAY THERE BEING UNTIED THOUGH HIS EYES WERE BLINDED HIS EARS WERE BUSY AND HE LISTENED TO THE SMOTHERED SOUNDS OF THE TRAP BEING FASTENED AND THE STONES BEING DRAWN OVER IT AGAIN
WE CAN'T DO IT A LOW MURMUR AROSE FROM BOTH CREWS
AND HE STOOD THERE LOOKING UP AS HE SAW THE BOY DESCENDING WITH A FAR GREATER SHOW OF ACTIVITY THAN HE COULD HAVE DISPLAYED
WHY IF I WAS TO COME AND SAY A THING LIKE THAT AND FOLKS ASHORE KNOWED ON IT THERE'D BE A HAXIDEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR SOME UN WOULD RUN UP AGIN ME ATOP O THE CLIFF AND I SHOULD GO OVER AND THERE'D BE AN END O ME YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT IF IT WAS KNOWN THAT YOU INFORMED YOU WOULD BE IN PERIL OF YOUR LIFE NO I DON'T MEAN TO SAY NOTHING O THE KIND MASTER
I SAY WELL THE LAD WAS TEN YARDS AWAY NOW HOLDING THE LANTHORN ABOVE HIS HEAD
WHAT AM I TO SAY TO MR BROUGH WHEN WE GET BACK
TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE HE GAVE HIMSELF A TWIST AND WAS ABOUT TO TURN OUT OF HIS SLEEPING PLACE AND THEN OPENED HIS EYES WIDELY AND STARED ABOUT HIM TOO MUCH OVERCOME STILL BY HIS HEAVY SLEEP TO QUITE COMPREHEND WHY IT WAS THAT HE WAS IN A GLOOMY OAK-PANELLED POORLY FURNISHED ROOM STARING AT AN IRON-BARRED OPEN WINDOW
AH TO BE SURE
THERE SIR SOMETIMES WE WIN AND MANY MORE TIMES WE LOSE
THANK YE SIR CRIED RAM
FIREPLACE--CHIMNEY
THERE MAKE HASTE AND FINISH THAT FOOD BOY
BUT THEY MAY BE UP AT SOME COTTAGE
WISH I HAD SOME OF THEM HERE THERE WERE RETIRING STEPS THEN AND ARCHY LEANED FORWARD TOWARDS THE WINDOW TO UTTER A FAINT CRY OF PAIN FOR HIS HEAD HAD COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMETHING AND AS HE PUT UP HIS HAND HE FOUND THAT THE WINDOW WAS PROTECTED BY THICK IRON BARS
I'M SURE OF IT
QUIET SHE CRIED AND FEELING BOUND TO ACT SHE WENT ON WITH THE MIDSHIPMAN KEEPING CLOSE UP AND PUTTING IN AN APOLOGETIC WORD ABOUT GIVING HER SO MUCH TROUBLE
THE DECK OF THE CUTTER
AND GIVING THE WORD THE MEN BIVOUACKED ON THE SHORT TURF TO EAT THE PROVENDER THEY HAD BROUGHT QUITE ALONE FOR NOT A SOUL FROM THE COTTAGES BETWEEN THE FARM AND THE CAVE APPEARED
IT WAS LAST SUMMER YES
A GULL OR TWO FLOATED ABOUT AND UTTERED THEIR QUERULOUS CALLS OTHERWISE THE SILENCE WAS PROFOUND AND THOUGH SHE SWEPT THE GREAT CURVED SIDES OF THE HOLLOW WHOSE END SEEMED FILLED UP BY THE TOWERING HILL ALL SOFT GREEN SLOPE TOWARD HER BUT SHEER SCARPED AND PROJECTING CLIFF TOWARD THE SEA THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH AS A SHEEP IN SIGHT
HE FANCIED HE HAD HEARD STEPS OUTSIDE THE ROOM DOOR AND HE RAN TO IT AND LISTENED IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT THE BOY MIGHT HAVE COME TO OPEN IT AND SET HIM FREE
THE BOY STATED HIS ERRAND
HE HAD HEARD BOTH VOICES BEFORE
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN
SPEAK OUT NAY I WEAN'T SAY A WORD SIR
I LOOKED WELL BOTH SIDES HUMPH
I SAY HAVE A PUFF NOW THERE WAS NO REPLY
SHACKLE FOLLOWED HIM NET IN ONE HAND WOODEN NETTING-NEEDLE IN THE OTHER
HOW LUCKY IT WAS I STOPPED THOUGHT THE MIDSHIPMAN
THEY TRUDGED ON ALMOST IN SILENCE FOR THE WHOLE PARTY WERE WEARIED OUT TILL AN ANNOUNCEMENT GALVANISED THEM ALL FOR SUDDENLY DICK PUT AN END TO THE QUESTION OF THEIR JOURNEYING WEST BY SUDDENLY SHOUTING SOUTH HO EH
I GOT A BLOW ON THE SHOULDER AND THEN SOME ONE GAVE ME A CHOP WITH A CUTLASS THAT WAS YOU DIRTY DICK
CHRISTEN RAMMYLEES AND IS THIS YOUR COW NO SIR THEN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HOW DARE YOU COME AND CLAIM IT CRIED THE LIEUTENANT WRATHFULLY
YOU MIGHT CATCH ONE BY ACCIDENT SO SHALL WE YET SIR
DON'T SAY THEY'VE GOT AWAY NO CRIED ARCHY EXCITEDLY
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS LIKED ME CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN BETWEEN THE MOUTHFULS HE WAS TAKING
WE'LL LOOK OUT TO-NIGHT AND AS SOON AS IT IS DAYLIGHT YOU SHALL MAKE SURE OF THE BEARINGS OF YOUR PRISON THEN WE'LL LAND A STRONG BOAT'S CREW AND GO ALONG THE TOP OF THE CLIFF TO THE PLACE AND PUT AN END TO THAT GAME
HOW DARE YOU SIT DOWN IN MY PRESENCE WHEN I'M SO DONE UP SIR AND HUNGRY AND FAINT AND SERVE YOU RIGHT YOU INSOLENT YOUNG DOG
WE SHALL HAVE TO TAME YOU DOWN SHOW ME THE WAY OUT OF THIS COME ALONG THEN SAID RAM WITH A SNEERING LAUGH
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT'S MY DUTY AND THAT I WAS SENT ASHORE TO FIND THIS OUT.--I SAY YES DID YOU KNOW I WAS SHUT UP LIKE THIS BY THOSE BEASTS OH NO NO NO YOUR FATHER DID
THIS ARRESTED HIM AND HE TRIED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION FOR HIS FOOT TO COME IN CONTACT WITH WHAT SEEMED TO BE ROUND AND PROVED TO BE A SPAR LYING IN COMPANY WITH SOME CAREFULLY FOLDED AND ROPE-BOUND SAILS
NO YOU DON'T HE MUTTERED AS HE WRENCHED HIMSELF ROUND AND CLUNG TO THE MAN
MAKING ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT A BOY WHO AS LIKE AS NOT IS HAVING A GAME WITH US
THE MIDSHIPMAN STOOD A LITTLE WAY BACK FROM THE WINDOW SEEING NOTHING BUT DRINKING ALL THIS IN AND IN IMAGINATION GRASPING THE WHOLE SCENE WHICH WENT ON FOR THE NEXT QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR SO BY WHICH TIME THE LAST LOAD SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BACK
WITH EVERY STONE REMOVED HOPE STRENGTHENED THE LITTLE PARTY
AND NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY BEFORE--BEFORE I TREAT YOU YES I'VE A GOOD MIND TO--LIKE SOME MUTINOUS SCOUNDREL AND--WHAT'S THAT SIR WHAT'S THAT
THINK OF HIM WITH HARDLY A MAN TO HELP HIM SAILING THE CUTTER AND KEEPING UP A STEADY FIRE LIKE THAT
GOING TO KEEP ON WATCHING OF COURSE
I SAY HE SAID WHAT'S THE GOOD OF GOING NOW
I SAY YOU ARE QUIET
ALL CHOKED-UP ALL RIGHT THEN BUT MAKE SURE OH I'M SURE ENOUGH SAID DICK
BOUT EIGHT MILE OUT BUT THE CUTTER WELL WHAT ABOUT THE CUTTER WILL IT BE SAFE SAFE
HE DECIDED FOR THE FORMER AS THE MORE EASY AND THE LESS LIKELY TO SUGGEST PERIL AND HE SPENT THE NEXT FEW HOURS AFTER CLEANSING HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO AS NOT TO EXCITE THE ATTENTION OF HIS YOUNG GAOLER AND IN HIS EFFORTS TO DO THIS HE MADE USE OF A PIECE OF SAILCLOTH AND AN END OF A COIL OF ROPE WHICH LAY WITH SOME SEA-GOING TACKLE HARD BY WHERE HE SLEPT
HE WAS HUNTING FOR A LANTHORN NOT FOR SPECIMENS
HUSH MASTER SHACKLE SAID THE TALL GENTLEMAN HUSKILY
I HAD TO BE ALWAYS GOING WITHOUT FATHER KNOWING AND TAKING EM BREAD AND BUTTER AND BACON AND EGGS
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE
HE LAY STILL HOPING THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE DRAWN FORTH THE EXCLAMATION BUT FOR THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS HE WAS IN AGONY
LET'S SEE SAID ARCHY TO HIMSELF
IT WAS A SIXPENNY ONE AND I WALKED ALL THE WAY TO DUNMOUTH AND BACK TO GET IT FOR YOU--TWENTY MILES
I THINK IF YOU DON'T MIND FARMER I'LL HAVE A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT
THEY THEN EMBARKED HEARTILY TIRED WITH THEIR WALK AND READY ENOUGH TO TAKE THE REST OF THE BURDEN OF THEIR JOURNEY ON THEIR HANDS AND ARMS BY ROWING STEADILY AND WELL THE TIDE BEING IN THEIR FAVOUR
CAN YOU MILK I CAN'T SAID RAM SHAKING HIS HEAD
IT WAS A HOT DAY AND HARD WORK BUT THE MEN PULLED AWAY CHEERFULLY FOR A RUN ASHORE WAS A CHANGE
A SUDDEN THOUGHT CAME--TO TIE HER HANDKERCHIEF ABOUT GRIP'S NECK AND SEND HIM HOME
WE SHALL SEARCH THE FARM AND THE HOZE TOO WON'T FIND NOTHING AT THE FARM
CELIA COULD HARDLY KEEP DOWN A HYSTERICAL CRY AS SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER THE LATTER WITH HER HAND UPON THE FORMER'S ARM
IS IT SIR SAID RAM VACANTLY
IN FACT AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS CONFUSION HE COULD HARDLY TELL FOR CERTAIN THAT HE WAS ON THE ROAD LEADING RIGHT AWAY TO THE COVE
TALLY'S ON DECK CK EJACULATED THE MAN THIS BEING MEANT FOR A DERISIVE LAUGH
WHERE WERE YOU THEN ON THE STONES HALF STUNNED CRIED ARCHY
NO USE TO TRY TO GET AWAY THE WORDS SEEMED MORE AND MORE THE WORDS OF TRUTH AS THE MIDSHIPMAN LISTENED AND HE WAS COMPELLED TO OWN IN HIS OWN MIND THAT HE HAD FAILED IN HIS ATTEMPT
I DON'T WANT TO SEE GROWLED THE OTHER AS HE STOOD PATTING THE NECK OF HIS OLD GREY HORSE
I WANT OUR BASKET
SUPPOSE THE TIDE HAD RISEN WHILE I WAS ASLEEP BUT THE JOYOUS FEELING WENT OFF AS HE STARED ABOUT HIM
IT WAS ABOUT THAT MAN SAID THE OTHER
NOW THEN WHEN IS THE CARGO TO BE RUN T'NIGHT AND WHERE NEVER YOU MIND WHEER
AND THEN AFTER GIVING THE WORD TO BE READY GURR BRACED HIMSELF UP
THEY WILL BE MORE SAVAGE IN THEIR HOLES AND THEREFORE AS YOU ARE SO YOUNG I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO GO WITH THE MEN SHOW THEM THE WAY AND THEN LEAVE THEM TO DO THE WORK ARCHY STARED AT HIM
FOR GOODNESS SAKE SPEAK
COME ON WAIT A BIT SAID RAM.--"I SAY DIDN'T TELL ME WHETHER YOU'D LIKE A BOTTLE O MILK ARCHY FELT AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO FLY AT THE BOY THE VERY MENTION OF THE MILK EXASPERATING HIM TO SUCH AN EXTENT
DON'T CHEER BUT SEEM TO BE TAKING IT COOLLY
THEY NEVER EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD GET VALUABLE INFORMATION SO SOON
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING ABOARD ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S SHIPS LIKE THAT EH TOUCH YOUR HAT SIR WHEN AN OFFICER SPEAKS TO YOU TOUCH MY HAT TO YOU LIKE I DO TO SIR RISDON LIKE YOU DO TO ANY GENTLEMAN SIR OH VERY WELL SAID RAM GIVING ONE OF HIS FAIR BROWN CURLS A TUG AND SHOWING HIS TEETH
OF ALL THE FIERCE LITTLE TARTARS
HERE DICK CAME IN SMOTHERED TONES
AHOY THEY STOPPED AND LISTENED AFTER THE MIDSHIPMAN HAD HAILED AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD
THAT'S IT
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE MY LADS CRIED ARCHY
HUSH THERE
WHAT DID IT MEAN HE ASKED HIMSELF
NOTHER O MY FRIGATE BAD HABITS IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE MR GURR TO BE ONE OF THOSE WHO SPEAK THE ENGLISH TONGUE SO DO NOT ABUSE IT
SAVE THE COW WHICH KEPT MAKING THE GREAT ROCK WALL ECHO WITH HER LOWINGS WHILE THREE MORE OF HER KIND NOW STOOD ON HIGH GAZING DOWN AT HER PLIGHT
BUT NOW HE HAD SEEN THE WAY OUT AND THE WAY FURTHER IN AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN HE WITHOUT APPARENT REASON TOOK UP A LONG NARROW PIECE OF STONE HANDLED IT FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AND SET IT DOWN CARELESSLY BUT NOT WITH SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE THAT HE DID NOT CONTRIVE THAT IT SHOULD ACT AS A ROUGH POINTER READY TO INDICATE THE DIRECTION OF THE DOOR
A CHILL OF HORROR RAN THROUGH HIM FOR THERE WITH THE WASH OF THE TIDE HALF COVERING AND THEN LEAVING THEM BARE WERE TWO MORE BRANDY KEGS WHICH HAD BEEN MISSED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT DURING THE FOG
COME HERE CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
YOU CAN CRIED THE LIEUTENANT THAT'S RIGHT
THE SAILORS WOULD COME AND PRETTY WELL TURN US OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME
IT IS NOT MY FATHER'S DOING
COME ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR WHAT'LL YER GIVE ME ANYTHING I CAN CRIED ARCHY EAGERLY
DON'T HURT HIS FEELINGS
IN FACT THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER HE WAS SEEN AS HE STOOD BACK WAITING TILL THEY HAD PASSED HIM AND THEN HESITATED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD MAKE FOR THE ENTRANCE AND ESCAPE
SHE'LL COME ON JUST AS THE TIDE'S TURNING SO AS TO HAVE NO FEAR OF BEING LEFT AGROUND YOU SEEM TO KNOW A GOOD DEAL ABOUT IT MY LAD SAID THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT
IF THAT YOUNG RUFFIAN SAW ME HE'D SAY I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE
AFTER HE HAD UNFASTENED THE END OF THE ROPE AND PASSED IT TO RAM WHO DID NOT SECURE THE END ABOUT HIM BUT THE MIDDLE AFTER HE HAD NEARLY DRAWN IT TIGHT SO THAT IF HE DID SLIP THE FALL WOULD NOT BE SO LONG
FOR A MOMENT THE LIEUTENANT THOUGHT OF MANNING THE BOATS AND SENDING IN PURSUIT BUT HE KNEW THAT SUCH AN ACT WOULD BE MADNESS
THEY FELT THAT THEY MUST LEAVE THESE PARTS FOR GOOD YES FOR GOOD SAID THE LIEUTENANT EMPHATICALLY
BEG'N PARDON SIR MR GURR SAID WELL WELL WELL WHAT DID MR GURR SAY
BUT THE BLACKNESS AROUND WHEN ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE BEGAN TO COME BACK TO HIS SENSES WOULD HAVE LEFT PITCH FAR BEHIND AS TO DEPTH OF TINT
NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT I CAN TELL YOU
GOOD-BYE HE SAID
THE LIGHT SHONE OUT THROUGH THE GRATED WINDOW BY WHICH HE WAS ON HANDS AND KNEES AND FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE AT ONCE RECOGNISED IF HIS FACE WAS SEEN HE CREPT ON UNDER THE WALL A FEW YARDS AND LAY FLAT LISTENING AS HE WISHED THAT THERE WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GET DOWN TO THE CLIFF AND SIGNAL FOR HELP TO CAPTURE THE SMUGGLERS AND THEIR STORE
SAY MESTER GURR VENTURED DICK AFTER A PAUSE NONE OF EM WOULDN'T HA DONE THAT WOULD THEY DICK HAD FOLLOWED THE MASTER'S LOOK AS HE SHADED HIS EYES AND STARED OVER THE GREEN SLOPE WHICH LED UP TO THE CLIFFS
I MEAN TO HAVE A TURN AT THAT CHAP MASTER GURR SIR
LONG AS HE LIKES THAT LAST SENTENCE SEEMED TO DRIVE THE PRISONER INTO A FIT OF ANGER WHICH LASTED TILL THE BOY'S NEXT COMING
SHE MUST HAVE WALKED OVER THE CLIFF IN THE FOG
OH THEN DOWN IN THE CELLAR'S THE PLACE SAID SHACKLE LAUGHING AND TAKING THREE MUGS FROM WHERE HIS WIFE HAD PLACED THEM
I CAN'T HELP IT
NOT HURT ARE YOU NO SAID ARCHY HOARSELY
THINK I'M GOIN TO BE FOOL ENOUGH TO RISK GETTIN MY NECK BROKE FOR FIFTY POUND
OH HELP I HELP HE SHOUTED THIS FRANTICALLY BUT A WILD AND MOURNFUL CRY FROM A GULL WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE AND HIS VOICE SEEMED TO BE UTTERLY LOST IN THE VAST SPACE AROUND
WERE THEY GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT AND SET HIM FREE
AS IT WAS THE ACTUAL FIRST LEAP TOOK HIM LEVEL WITH THE DOOR OF THE CELLAR THE SECOND RIGHT ON TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS BEYOND IN THE DARKNESS AND AS HE STOOD PANTING THERE HE REALISED THE MEANING OF THE OLD SMUGGLER'S MISTAKE
DID YOU SPEAK TO ME SIR CRIED ARCHY FACING ROUND AND FROWNING
IT'S NO USE TO TRY AND HIDE IT
FOR A LONG TIME HE COULD HEAR NOTHING
MEANWHILE THE BOAT CONTAINING ARCHY RAYSTOKE AND GURR THE MASTER WITH HER CREW WAS ROWED STEADILY ALONG UNDER THE CLIFFS THE DEEP WATER BEING CLOSE UP
AS SOON AS HE WAS DOWN ON LEVEL GROUND THE BOY STARTED FOR HOME AT A TROT GAVE THE LANTHORNS INTO HIS MOTHER'S HANDS AND AFTER A BRIEF INQUIRY AS TO HIS FATHER'S WHEREABOUTS HE STARTED OFF ONCE MORE
AND IF YOU DARE TO SAY SUCH THINGS OF MY DEAR GOOD SUFFERING FATHER I'LL GO AWAY AND NEVER HELP YOU I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT SAID ARCHY STURDILY
AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO OWN THAT RAM HAD BEHAVED VERY WELL
BUT HE COULD HEAR NO HORSES NOW
I SHALL BE RUINED--SUCH A SET OF CARELESS PEOPLE ABOUT ME
AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE NOW ARCHY WAS IN THE PROPER ROAD AND AS HE WALKED ALONG HE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON COMING AT LAST TO THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST JUMPED THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE DONE THAT NIGHT IF THE FARMER AND HIS PEOPLE WERE CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED
BUT AT LAST SEIZING THE STONE AND GETTING HIS FINGERS WELL IN THE JOINT HE GAVE IT A VIGOROUS SHOVE AND THEN UTTERED A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH FOR TO HIS DELIGHT THERE CAME A SHARP CRACK AND AFTER GIVING A VIGOROUS SHOVE THE STONE WHICH WAS ABOUT TWENTY INCHES LONG WAS DRAWN OUT AND BECAME THE INSTRUMENT FOR DISLODGING ITS FELLOWS
ON'Y WANT OUR COW THEN TAKE HER SIR AND GO HAVE A DROP OF MILK NO SAID THE LIEUTENANT TURNING HIS BACK
I WILL NOT THE LADS COULD RUN IT UP THE VALLEY AND DOWN INTO YOUR CELLAR SIR RISDON WHISPERED THE MAN AS IF AFRAID THAT THE OLD GREY HORSE WOULD HEAR
THAT'S WHAT HE IS
I KNOW DON'T CRY HE SAID
HERE BOY WAS WHISPERED CLOSE TO HIS EAR
OH CRIED THE GIRL TAKING A STEP NEARER TO THE MIDSHIPMAN HOW I HATE YOU MISS GRAEME I THOUGHT YOU A NICE FRANK BOY AND THAT YOU WOULD BE OUR FRIEND CELIA MY CHILD WHISPERED LADY GRAEME REPROACHFULLY
THAT'S GOOD NEWS
WON'T DO RAYSTOKE THOUGH YOU AND I ARE CONDEMNED TO LIVE IN THIS MISERABLE LITTLE CUTTER AND ON A CONTEMPTIBLE KIND OF DUTY WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE OFFICERS AND GENTLEMEN IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE
NO BLOODSHED MY LADS
I WAS JUST THINKING OF COMING TO YOU SIR EH WHAT FOR IT SEEMS TO ME SIR THAT IF THAT CARGO WAS RUN AND IS HIDDEN ANYWHERE NEAR THEY'LL BE MOVING IT TO-NIGHT OF COURSE
THEY HAD A VALUABLE CARGO HIDDEN IN THE CELLAR BENEATH WHERE HE STOOD AND THEMSELVES TO SAVE AND NATURALLY THEY WOULD NOT HESITATE TO DEAL HARDLY WITH HIM WHEN QUITE A YOUNG APPARENTLY GENTLE GIRL TREATED HIM AS SHE HAD DONE
SEE THAT THE PEOPLE WAS NODDING AND WINKING TO ONE ANOTHER AS WE WENT BY THEIR COTTAGES YES I DID SEE SOMETHING OF THE KIND ONCE OR TWICE REPLIED ARCHY
YOU WON'T HAVE TO USE EM BUT IT'LL KEEP THOSE DUTCHIES FROM SHOWING FIGHT THAT WILL ALL BE DONE MY MAN GOING TO GET OUT FOUR OR FIVE MILE MASTER AND THEN WE CAN HEAD ROUND AND GET CLEAR O THE LONG RACE AND THE SKERRIES
IT'S BUTTER AND CHICKUNS AND PORK AND CREAM AND EGGS OH CRIED THE GIRL JOYOUSLY MY MOTHER WILL BE SO SHE STOPPED SHORT REMEMBERING SUNDRY LESSONS SHE HAD RECEIVED AND THE TEARS CAME UP INTO HER EYES AS SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST BE PROUD AND NOT SHOW HER DELIGHT AT THE RECEIPT OF HOMELY DELICACIES TO WHICH THEY WERE STRANGERS
WHAT'S THAT
WELL EJACULATED JEMMY SO SHE BE WHY COULDN'T YOU BELIEVE ME BEFORE WHEN I TOLD YOU THOUGHT YOU WAS GAMMONING ME MY LAD THERE ROW AWAY CRIED RAM
SHALL I TRY YES SAID THE LIEUTENANT
THAT CAN'T BE THE WAY SIR OH HANG IT ALL MY LAD CRIED THE MASTER IN DISAPPOINTED TONES
THEN UP THE FAMILIAR WAY WITH ITS RUGGED STEPS AND ON TO THE NEWLY MORTARED WALL WITH ITS LOOPHOLE THROUGH WHICH THE GLORIOUS LIGHT OF DAY STREAMED
DON'T COME AGAIN WITHOUT JEMMY DADD OR SOME ONE NO FATHER SO YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET AWAY DID YOU SAID THE SMUGGLER WITH AN UGLY SMILE
I WISH I WAS NOT SO FRIGHTENED OF THESE PLACES SHE SAID TO HERSELF
D'YER HEAR JEMMY DADD
MR RAYSTOKE I SAY WHERE ARE YOU
THEN HE TURNED RATHER DESPONDENT FOR HE KNEW THAT THE NEXT DAY THERE WOULD BE AN EXPEDITION ASHORE WHEN VISITS WOULD BE PAID TO THE FARM AND TO THE HOZE AND HE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE GRAEMES
THE FIRST THING TO DO WAS TO FIND THAT LANTHORN OF WHOSE POSITION HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME VAGUE IDEA
I DO WISH HE'D BE FRIENDS THOUGHT RAM WHEN HIS MUSINGS WERE INTERRUPTED BY HIS FATHER SAYING AH THERE'S THAT BASKET JEMMY FOUND'S MORNIN GO AND TAKE IT UP TO THE HOZE HE NEEDN'T GO TO-NIGHT NEED HE SAID MRS SHACKLE
THE DISTANCE WAS SHORT BUT SHE WAS CONTENT TO WATCH THE BEAUTIFUL CHANGES ON THE FAR-SPREADING WASTE FROM HIGH UP ON THE HILLS
RAM FACED ROUND STARED AT THE OFFICER'S RATHER SHABBY UNIFORM AND GAVE HIS CURL ANOTHER TUG BEFORE PULLING HIS RED CAP OVER HIS BROW
HE HAS FOUND A RABBIT SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF AS HER EYES WANDERED ABOUT THE SIDES OF THE PIT AND BRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF THE ABUNDANT CLUSTERS OF BLACKBERRIES FINER AND RIPER THAN ANY SHE HAD YET SECURED
WE SAW HER SWIMMING AND FETCHED HER ON BOARD THANK YE SAID RAM
BUT FOSSILS WERE UNKNOWN THINGS IN ARCHY RAYSTOKE'S DAY
FOR IF THEY HAD BEEN ABOARD AT THE FIRST SHOT THE ANCHOR WOULD HAVE BEEN WEIGHED OR SLIPPED AND THE WHITE HAWK GONE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON PROBABLY TO HELP CAPTURE A HEAVILY LADEN SMUGGLER CRAFT
YOU'RE RIGHT MR RAYSTOKE HE ADDED A MINUTE LATER
IS HE GOING TO ASK US TO DINNER RAM LAD AND SEND FOR HIS SKIPPER TO JYNE US ARCHY PAID NO HEED TO THE MAN'S JEERING WORDS FOR HE WAS THINKING OF THE PLACE AND TRYING TO FIX IT ALL IN HIS MEMORY FOR USE WHEN THESE TWO HAD GONE
OR ELSE SLOPED OUTWARD AND CONCEALED WHAT WAS ABOVE
BUT A QUESTION SEEMED TO LEAP FROM HIS LIPS NEXT MOMENT AND HE SAID SHARPLY PERHAPS THERE'S NO GETTING DOWN BUT ANY ONE MIGHT CLIMB UP RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF FLY MIGHT OR A BEEDLE SAID THE BOY LAUGHING
WHAT'S IN IT LOBSTER-POTS AND OLD SAIL
CAN'T I ORFICER YES SAID ARCHY QUIETLY
PITCH HIM OVERBOARD
DON'T BE A FOOL NO SIR REPLIED DICK HUMBLY AND THE MEN TRAMPED ON WITH A COUPLE OF OPEN-MOUTHED BAREFOOTED BOYS FOLLOWING THEM TO STARE AT THEIR CUTLASSES AND PISTOLS
WHAT A DESPATCH I CAN WRITE IT WILL BE THE BREAKING UP OF THE GANG WILL IT NOT SIR ASKED ARCHY
IT WAS A VERY DARK ROW BACK TO THE CUTTER BUT HER LIGHTS SHONE OUT CLEARLY OVER THE SMOOTH SEA FORMING GOOD BEACONS FOR THE MEN TO FOLLOW TILL THE BOAT WAS RUN ALONGSIDE
FORRARD MY LADS
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TRIED TO SAVE MINE BUT I MIGHT HAVE SLIPPED AND GONE OVER THE CLIFF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SAID ARCHY QUIETLY
I DO WANT TO HELP YOU TO GET AWAY I CAN'T PROMISE SAID ARCHY AT LAST AFTER A BITTER STRUGGLE WITH SELF
THERE WERE A FEW SHEEP HERE AND THERE BUT THE HOZE WAS HIDDEN BEYOND A FOLD OF THE MIGHTY HILLS AND SHACKLE'S FARM AND THE LABOURER'S COTTAGE WERE ALL DOWN IN ONE OF THE VALLEYS
GO BELOW AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT WHILE I MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT I SHALL DO ARCHY WENT INTO THE CABIN NOT AT ALL SATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF HIS RUN ASHORE AND HE DID NOT FEEL MUCH BETTER AFTER HIS MEAL WHEN HE WENT ON DECK JUST IN TIME TO FIND THE LIEUTENANT LAYING DOWN THE LAW TO RAM AND JEMMY DADD
AH MY LAD IT'S ALL A FLAM
BEG PARDON SIR WHAT SHALL I DO GO AND MILK HER AND DON'T BOTHER ME BUT SHE'S SWIMMING UNDER THE CLIFF SIR GO AND ASK HER ON BOARD THEN
I WISH MY FATHER KNEW HE NEED NOT HAVE TROUBLED HIMSELF TO WISH FOR FARMER SHACKLE WAS LYING DOWN HIDDEN BEHIND SOME STONES ON THE TOP OF THE CLIFF WATCHING WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH HIS BROW RUGGED
DID I DREAM IT ALL SHE SAID IN AN AWE-STRICKEN WHISPER
JUST GOT HER EMPTY AS THE TIDE TURNED
WHO'S THIS HE CRIED AS HE NEARLY FELL OVER A PROSTRATE FIGURE
HOW IT BLEEDS WHY WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THEY CAME AT US SIR LIKE MAD BULLS AND FORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS THEY HAD ME
GOOD JOB I DIDN'T GET IT ON MY HEAD
PLACE IS SAFE ENOUGH FROM THE SEASIDE AND SO IT IS FROM THE LAND
THERE IT IS AGAIN AWAY TO THE LEFT
WHY SIR YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A PLEASURE IN BREAKING HIS LAWS AFTER THE WAY HE HAS ROBBED YOU AND TURNED YOU FROM A REAL GENTLEMAN INTO A POOR HARD-PRESSED COUNTRY SQUIRE WHO HUSH
IF YOU DO THIS I'LL PROMISE TO INTERCEDE FOR YOU TWO AND I DARESAY I CAN SAVE YOU FROM PUNISHMENT WELL THAT'S HANDSOME
YOU WOULDN'T BE KEPT HERE IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR YOU TO ESCAPE ARCHY FELT TOO MUCH DEPRESSED TO MAKE ANY SHARP REPLY AND THE SMUGGLER TURNED TO HIS SON
A BOY HAD COME ASHORE AND NOT RETURNED
BUT AS SOON AS SHE SEES US SHE'LL RUN DOWN AND PICK US UP HURRAH SHOUTED THE MEN
SHUT ME UP HERE WOULD THEY
WHO EVER HEARD OF A PHANTOM LOBSTER-BOAT DICK SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THEN SAT PLAYING WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS OAR
AND AS TO THAT BLACKAVISED SCOUNDREL WHO CAME AND CHEATED ME AS HE DID--OH IF I COULD ONLY SEE HIM HUNG A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER AFTER SEEING THE LUGGER'S MASTS AND SAILS SLOWLY DISAPPEAR THE CUTTER WAS ONCE MORE AT HER OLD MOORINGS AND LEAVING THE BOATSWAIN IN CHARGE THE LIEUTENANT HAD HIMSELF ROWED ASHORE TO LAND UPON THE LEDGE AND CAREFULLY SEARCH THE ROCKS FOR SOME SIGHT OF A CARGO HAVING BEEN LANDED
JUST AS HE WAS PASSING HE STOPPED SHORT UTTERING AN EJACULATION
I ARN'T A BIT THIN-SKINNED
I'M GOING TO LEAVE THE BASKET AND THE PUFFS AND CHEESE
I SAY HE SAID AS HE FORMED RING AFTER RING OF ROPE THAT ROCK ISN'T VERY SAFE
GIVE WAY THE MEN PULLED IN QUICKLY AND AT THE END OF A FEW MINUTES THEY WERE AS CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE LEDGE AS IT WAS SAFE TO GO FOR AS THE WAVES RAN IN THE LARGER ONES LEAPED RIGHT OVER THE BROAD LEVEL SPACE WASHING IT FROM END TO END
HIS HEAD ACHED AND THERE WAS A FEELING IN IT SUGGESTIVE OF THE CONTENTS HAVING BEEN TURNED INTO BRAIN-FRITTERS IN A PAN--FRITTERS WHICH HAD BUBBLED AND TURNED BROWN AND THEN BEEN BURNED TILL THEY WERE QUITE BLACK
AND HE WENT OFF WHISTLING MERRILY TILL HE WAS AT THE OPENING WHEN HE SHOUTED BACK NO OATS TO-DAY PONY
YOU'D KNOW I WAS A SNEAK AND A TRAITOR AS YOU CALL IT TO FATHER AND ALL OUR CHAPS AND YOU'D NEVER LIKE ME LIKE YOU
THE STONE SEEMED AS FAST AS EVER AND HIS PROGRESS WAS GETTING VERY SLOW NOW FOR HE HAD CLEARED AWAY THE MORTAR AS FAST AS HE COULD REACH IN
HE RUBBED HIS HANDS FOR SOME THIRTY FEET BELOW THERE WAS CERTAINLY A NARROW POSSIBLE PLACE AND FROM THERE PERHAPS ANOTHER MIGHT BE FOUND
IN THIS SPIRIT SHE ONCE MORE REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE OLD QUARRY AND PEERED DOWN LISTENING TO THE WORRYING SOUND MADE BY THE DOG WHO KEPT RATTLING ONE PIECE OF STONE OVER ANOTHER EVERY NOW AND THEN GIVING A SHORT SNAPPING BARK
HIS DINNER'S READY SHALL I CARRY HIM LAD LOOK HERE CRIED ARCHY HAUGHTILY
AND YOU WAS SHUT UP HERE ALL THAT TIME AND DIDN'T GO MAD SAID GURR
NO GOOD TO GIVE ORDERS HERE SAID THE LATTER GRINNING
YES CRIED THE LAD
BUT WHAT DID MR GURR MEAN ABOUT GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
YOUR SKIPPER WOULDN'T HANG A BOY LIKE ME
AND THERE SURE ENOUGH AS DISCOVERED ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE BY CELIA WAS THE SCOOPED-OUT HOLLOW FILLED WITH FERN BRAMBLE AND WILD CLEMATIS AND THE ROUGH STEPS DOWN AND THE ARCHWAY DIMLY SEEN BEYOND THE LOOSE STONES
WISH I COULD HAVE HAD ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO'S SLEEP
OH OF COURSE REPLIED THE BOY GRINNING
THEN YOU GO UP FIRST AND WHEN I COME YOU'LL BE READY TO LEND ME A HAND YES THAT WILL BE BEST SAID ARCHY
IT WAS A SHREWD GUESS AND HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT SO LITTLE SUCCESS ATTENDED THE EFFORTS OF THE REVENUE CUTTER'S CREW TO TRACE CARGOES WHICH HAD BEEN LANDED WHEN THE SMUGGLERS HAD SUCH LURKING PLACES AS THIS
HERE MR GURR SEE THESE SMUGGLING SCOUNDRELS OFF THE DECK THIS WAS SOON DONE THE COW BEING EASILY GOT INTO THE BOAT AND JUST AS IT WAS GROWING DARK RAM STOOD UP TO PUSH FROM THE SIDE
COME HERE BOY HE SAID IMPORTANTLY
DON'T BE SO HARD
AND NOW AS HE LOOKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE SHELF ON WHICH HE LAY IT STRUCK HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE DESCENT AND TURNING HIS EYES AWAY HE LOOKED UP AGAIN FOR A WAY THERE
GET TOM TO HELP YOU TO-MORROW
WHY SHOULD HE WANT TO SLIP OVER THE CLIFF
THEN IN THE MIDST OF THE AWE-INSPIRING SILENCE RAM SPOKE I THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE THE POWDER CAUGHT AND THEN BEFORE ANY ONE COULD REPLY THE LAD SAID QUIETLY I DIDN'T WANT TO BE BURNT TO DEATH
NOW HE THREW A PIECE OF STONE TO HIS LEFT HAND TO HIS RIGHT AND AFTER GOING MANY YARDS AT WHAT WAS BUT A SNAIL'S PACE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PLACE HAD SUDDENLY CONTRACTED AND AFTER CREEPING A LITTLE FARTHER THE PLACE WAS MORE CONTRACTED STILL AND ASCENDED
HE SPRUNG UP ANGRILY NOW IN THE MIDST OF THE LAUGHTER AND TOUCHED HIS FOREHEAD TO HIS COMMANDING OFFICER
THEN CAME IN THE LOUD GRUFF VOICE BACK LADS QUICK HE WAS SEIZED AND RETREAT HAD BEGUN WHEN AGAIN RANG OUT HALT--STAND THE SMUGGLERS WERE BETWEEN TWO FIRES
THEY HAD STRUGGLED TO THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE INWARD PART OF THE SHELF AND AS THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS AT THE END OF HIS STRENGTH AND RAM REALISED IT THE BOY SMILED THRUST BACK HIS RIGHT LEG TO GIVE IMPETUS TO HIS NEXT THRUST AND HIS FOOT WENT DOWN OVER THE ROCK
DIDN'T YOU HEAR YES
THE CUNNING RASCAL
HA ONCE MORE
AND SO IT PROVED AFTER A LONG SEARCH AND HE SANK DOWN SO WEARIED OUT THAT AS HE CHOSE BY PREFERENCE TO LIE DOWN HE WAS BEFORE MANY MINUTES HAD ELAPSED IN A DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP FORGETFUL OF THE DARKNESS AND ANY PERIL THAT MIGHT BE READY TO ASSAIL HIM NEXT
WELL NEVER MIND WHAT I DID SIR
RAM IS GOING TO GATHER BLACKBERRIES SHE SAID TO HERSELF AS SHE GLANCED AT HIS BASKET
STOP HIM CRIED A THIRD
AND IF SHE TAPPED ON THE DOOR WITH HER KNUCKLES THERE WOULD BE A DULL SOUND INSTEAD OF A HOLLOW ECHOING NOISE
WE'LL SOON HAVE HER ON BOARD DICK WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD FOR THE TASK WAS EASY WITH A VESSEL SO LOW IN THE WATER AS THE CUTTER
HIS IMMEDIATE THOUGHT WAS TO GIVE CHASE BUT THE SWIFT SAILING VESSEL WAS WELL AWAY WITH A FAVOURABLE WIND AND SHE WOULD MOST PROBABLY GET ACROSS THE CHANNEL BEFORE HE COULD OVERTAKE HER AND EVEN IF HE WERE SO LUCKY AS TO CATCH UP TO HER WHAT THEN
IN THERE
YOU AND ME COULD PLAY A GAME SOMETIMES AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T FEEL HALF SO DULL
IT'S HORRID DULL AND DARK HERE AND LONESOME
DON'T KNOW AND IF I DID I WOULDN'T TELL SAID THE BOY BLUNTLY
THERE WAS A BLISTER TOO IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND WHERE THE KNIFE HAD PRESSED
THEY'VE FOUND THREE KEGS--THAT'S ALL
DON'T RAKE UP MY MISFORTUNES NOT I SIR RISDON
FATHER WOULD MAKE A ROW IF HE KNEW
I CAN POINT IT OUT FROM THE SEA BUT IT WILL BE ALL GUESS-WORK FROM THE SHORE NEVER MIND
WHY YOU CAN'T HARDLY FIND A PLACE TO LAND HERE WITHOUT GETTING YOUR BOAT STOVE IN IF ALL'S TRUE THE SMUGGLERS KNOW HOW TO LAND THINGS SAID ARCHIBALD AS HE GAZED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE CLIFFS
THEN TOO THERE WAS SOMETHING OPPRESSING IN THE POORLY PROTECTED SHAFTS WITH THEIR SLOPING DESCENTS ONCE PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BACK THE BUSY SPOTS WHERE OLD HEWERS OF STONE WORKED THEIR WAY DOWN BELOW THE THINNER AND POORER STRATA TO WHERE THE FREESTONE WAS CLEAN AND SOLID
AS HE WAITED HE COULD NOT HELP TURNING HIS EYES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LONG SOLITARY HOUSE IN THE PATCH OF WOODLAND AND FOUND HIMSELF WONDERING WHETHER HE SHOULD EVER GO UP THERE AGAIN
IT WAS SO FOGGY YOU ARE PLAYING WITH ME SIR
NO NO,--YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN
THAT'S MORE COMF'TABLE
AND ALL THE TIME HE COULD HEAR THE FOOTSTEPS GROWING MORE AND MORE FAINT
ARCHY RAYSTOKE HARDLY DARED TO THINK AND KNELT THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS TREMBLING HANDS RESTING UPON THE BASKET WHICH HE WAS AFRAID TO OPEN LEST IT SHOULD NOT CONTAIN THAT WHICH HE LOOKED FOR
CHAPTER SEVEN
I CAN'T PROMISE CAME UP HUSKILY IN FAINT SMOTHERED TONES
SOME ONE'S BEEN GIVING HER A QUID O BACCA GO ON BUT SOME ONE HAS
AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS DUCKS SAID THE LAD TO HIMSELF AS HE SLUNG HIS DARKENED LANTHORNS TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO DESCEND AS COOLLY AS IF HE HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY NATURE WITH WINGS TO GUARD HIM AGAINST A FALL DOWN THE CLIFF
NO HARM DONE HE SAID AS HE LOOKED UP TO WHERE THE HOLE FROM WHICH HE HAD ESCAPED WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK QUITE SMALL
THEN AS HE LISTENED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE BOY CLIMBED UP SOMEWHERE TALKING THE WHILE TO HIS COMPANION THEIR VOICES SOUNDING HOLLOW AND RUMBLING THEN THERE WAS A PAUSE THE DULL THUD OF A CLOSING DOOR THE DRAWING OF BOLTS AND SOON THE RATTLING OF HEAVY STONES AND ONCE MORE ALL WAS SILENT
BUT IF YOU WILL HAVE IT THE WORD'S WAR AND A VOLLEY OF BULLETS NEXT TIME YOU COME ON NO NO DON'T FIRE
NEVER MIND THAT
WHAT DO YOU WANT LEAVE TO GO ASHORE SIR WELL YOU'RE GOING SOON AS THE SKIPPER ORDERS I MEAN ALL ALONE BY MYSELF SIR WHAT FOR
THOUGHT OF WHAT A DISGRACEFUL THING IT WAS FOR A TITLED GENTLEMAN TO MIX HIMSELF UP WITH SMUGGLING AND WHAT A REVELATION HE WOULD HAVE FOR THE LIEUTENANT AND THE MASTER WHO HAD BEEN SO EASILY DELUDED BY SIR RISDON'S BEARING
JUMP ASHORE TWO OF YOU AND ARREST THEM BEFORE THEY RUN RAM TURNED AND STARED AT JEMMY DADD WITH AN ILL-USED COUNTENANCE
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TAKING HOLD NEAR THE EDGE AND CROUCHED THERE PICTURING THE BOY TURNING DIZZY ONCE MORE FROM HIS INJURY LETTING GO AND DROPPING WITH A TERRIBLE JERK TO THE EXTENT OF THE ROPE WHERE IT WAS TIED
WHAT'S THE MATTER LAD?--HURT NO
LOOK AT HER MATE SAID ONE OF THE SAILORS
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE FOG REACHES UP FAR DID YOU SIGNAL S'AFTERNOON FATHER LANTHORNS
WELL LET EM GO SAID SHACKLE
MAKING A BIT OF A PATROL SAID GURR
THAT'S ELDER WINE IN THE LITTLE BARREL
THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND HE TAPPED AGAIN
THE MIDSHIPMAN DREW IN A LONG BREATH OF THE SALT AIR AS HE STOOD AT THE OPENING IN THE CLIFF FACE
I LIKE YOU THAT I DO BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A BRAVE CHAP AND NOT AFRAID OF ANY OF US
QUICK BEFORE THEY ALL GO OFF YES SAID ARCHY
THE SOUND OF BLOWS MEN SWAYED AND STRUGGLED ABOUT WILDLY AND THE LAD BOUND BLINDFOLDED AND HELPLESS WAS THRUST HERE AND THERE
LOWER AWAY THE SUSPENSE IN THE DARKNESS SEEMED STRAINED TO BREAKING POINT AND ARCHY LAY WITH HIS HEART BEATING PAINFULLY WATCHING TILL IT SEEMED AS IF THE CASE WAS HOPELESS AND THAT IF DICK NOW NEARLY OFF THE CLIFF COULD GRIP HOLD OF THE FALLEN MAN THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO GET HIM AND HIS BURDEN BACK
THERE MISS SAID RAM WITH A GRIN
AT ALL EVENTS I'LL TRY
I HEARD THAT HE WAS BURNED TO DEATH YOUR SON IS QUITE WELL ABOARD MY SHIP THANK GOD
THEN FEELING THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE WRONG TURNING HE RETRACED HIS STEPS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD GOING ON AND ON WITHOUT AVAIL AND NEVER STOPPING
SHAKE HANDS ON IT IS THAT NECESSARY SAID THE LIEUTENANT GLANCING WITH DISTASTE AT THE GREAT OUTSTRETCHED PALM
SHE COULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY NO SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN
WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY THE HURRIED WHISPER OF THOSE WHO CAME RUNNING AFT
NOW THEN HE SAID RISING WITH THE BASKET IN HIS HAND THE FIRST THING IS TO FIND A PLACE TO STOW YOU AND HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING LEDGE AFTER LEDGE THAT WOULD HAVE HELD THE BASKET BUT HE WANTED ONE THAT WOULD BE EASILY FOUND IN THE DARKNESS
RAM AND JEMMY HAD NO TIME FOR THINKING
OYSTERS BEG PARDON SIR
A STRANGE DEPRESSING SENSATION CAME OVER THE YOUNG PRISONER AS HE STOOD THERE ONCE MORE ALONE BUT HE TURNED SHARPLY ROUND WITH HIS TEETH SET THOUGHT FOR A FEW MOMENTS ABOUT HIS COURSE BACK AND THEN FEELING MORE DETERMINED AND FIRM WALKED SLOWLY ON AND TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT FOUND THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BECOME EDUCATED TO DO WITHOUT SIGHT FOR EACH TIME THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS NEAR A PILLAR HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO FIND THAT HE TOUCHED IT AND WITH VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY HE WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE OLD SAIL FELT ABOUT AND THERE WAS THE BASKET OF FOOD WHICH HE ATTACKED AT ONCE AND SOON AFTER FELL ASLEEP
THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE TO SEARCH AS FAR AS GURR COULD SEE SAVE THE LITTLE FARM IN THE HOLLOW AND THE BLACK-LOOKING STONE HOUSE UP ON THE HILL AMONG THE TREES
AND INSTEAD OF DOING YOUR DUTY YOU WENT OFF LIKE A CONTEMPTIBLE CABIN-BOY ON A SHORE-GOING GAME SIR DISSIPATION SIR--BEHAVED LIKE A BLACKGUARD TILL ALL YOUR MONEY WAS SPENT
AND TEN MINUTES LATER THE PRISONER WAS SEATED IN HIS OLD PLACE IN THE DARKNESS WITH RAM'S BASKET OF PROVISIONS FOR CONSOLATION
THESE WERE REMOVED AT LENGTH AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN WHEN A PECULIAR DIM BLUISH MIST SLOWLY ROSE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE
SHE'LL DIE AND YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR HER
I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL I DON'T THINK I OUGHT TO HAVE LET A BOY LIKE THAT GO ALONE
ISN'T IT JEMMY SAID RAM MOCKINGLY
RAM CRIED ARCHY RUNNING BACK TO WHERE THE BOY LAY BOUND BEHIND A PILE OF STONES FORGOTTEN FOR THE TIME AND UNHEEDED BY HIS COMPANIONS
I KNOW ALL THE SCOUNDRELS SECRETS NOW AND YOU CAN CAPTURE THEM AND MAKE SOME GOOD HAULS
HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
GOING ASHORE YES
IT SEEMED A VERY EASY THING TO DO TO LOOSEN ONE STONE IN A RUGGED WALL DRAW IT OUT AND THEN REMOVE THE OTHER BUT IN PRACTICE IT APPEARED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND AGAIN GOING BACK INTO THE QUARRY TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY ARCHY RETURNED TO HIS TASK AND AFTER WORKING AWAY AGAIN FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR HE FELL FAST ASLEEP
HOW LONG HE SLEPT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT HE STARTED AWAKE AGAIN TO FIND THAT IT WAS QUITE DARK AND HE KEPT ON LIKE ONE IN A DREAM
I TOLD FATHER SO AND HE SAID I WAS A FOOL HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE SHORT TURF WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH BLACK AND GREY AS THE ROOKS JACKDAWS AND GULLS MARCHED ABOUT FEEDING TOGETHER IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY WHERE THE TINY STRIPED SNAILS HUNG UPON THE STRANDS OF GRASS BY MILLIONS
BUT TO-MORROW HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMING AND YOU HAVEN'T COME TILL TO-NIGHT
TO ALL OF WHICH ATTENTIONS THE ANIMAL SUBMITTED CALMLY ENOUGH BLINKING HER EYES AND GENTLY SWINGING HER TAIL
WHAT A HORRIBLY DIRTY WRETCH I MUST LOOK A HAIL CAME FROM THE CUTTER AT LAST AND WAS ANSWERED FROM THE BOAT ARCHY'S HEART BEATING FAST AS HE DIMLY SAW THE FIGURES ON BOARD AND THOUGHT OF THE JOY OF BEING ONCE MORE IN HIS OWN CABIN
BUT HE ALWAYS CAME OUT AGAIN TO HIS MEN WITH AN ANXIOUS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND GENERALLY RANGED UP ALONGSIDE OF DICK
HE WAS CLIMBING UP NOW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A STEEP SLOPE OVER GREAT FRAGMENTS OF STONE HEAVIER THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIFT AND HE SEEMED TO CREEP UP AND UP TILL HE FELT ASSURED THAT THE CEILING WAS JUST ABOVE HIM AND RAISING HIS HAND HE TOUCHED THE ROOF HIS FINGERS TRACING OUT AGAIN THE GREAT CAST OF ONE OF THE OLD-WORLD SHELL-FISH--ONE OF THE GREAT NAUTILUSES OF THE GEOLOGIST
THEY COULD NOT
SHE DON'T MEAN US TO OVERHAUL HER
VERY WELL I SHALL RAISE NO OBJECTION
AND ME GIVING A BIT OF ADVICE TOO SAID JEMMY IN AN ILL-USED TONE
IT'S A LONG PULL CRIED THE MASTER
NO LAD EVER SPRANG TO HIS WORK WITH MORE ALACRITY AND AS HE LEAPED INTO THE BOAT AND THE MEN DROPPED THEIR OARS THERE WAS A HEARTY LOOK OF WELCOME IN EACH SMILING FACE
LET'S GET SOME EGGS TO TAKE BACK EGGS GRUMBLED THE WEATHER-BEATEN OFFICER
I THOUGHT I COULD OFTEN COME HERE AND SIT AND TALK TO YOU AND BRING A LIGHT AND I BROUGHT THESE HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE HORN LANTHORN AND PRODUCED FROM HIS POCKET A VERY DIRTY OLD PACK OF CARDS AT WHICH ARCHY STARED WITH PROFOUND DISGUST
MAN'S SURE TO GET WRONG THERE THE MEN FORGOT THEIR WEARINESS IN THE EXCITEMENT AS THEY REALISED THAT SOME VESSEL WAS IN CHASE OF A SMUGGLER BUT THEY MURMURED AMONG THEMSELVES AT THEIR ILL LUCK AT BEING AWAY FROM THE CUTTER
YOU SHALL HAVE A REWARD AS IF I WANTED A REWARD PANTED CELIA
BANG_--_BANG_--A COUPLE MORE EXPLOSIONS AND THE MEN CROWDED UP TO ARCHY THE MASTER INCLUDED AS IF TO ASK WHAT NEXT
BE READY THE MIDSHIPMAN GAVE HIS HEAD A JERK BUT THE EFFORT WAS VAIN FOR THE HAND OVER HIS EYES GAVE PLACE TO A BROAD HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS TIGHTLY TIED BEHIND AND THEN A FIERCE VOICE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR KEEP STILL OR YOU'LL GET YOUR WEASAND SLIT
PLEASE BE QUICK
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK OF SUCH TRIFLING THINGS IN THE FULL BURST OF SO MUCH BEAUTY FOR AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER THE SEA WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD-RED AND GOLDEN BEGAN TO TURN OF A VIVID BLUE DEEPER THAN THE CLEAR SKY OVERHEAD
OH YOU BAD DOG SHE CRIED MERRILY HOW I WILL PUNISH YOU AND SHE STOOPED AND PICKED A COUPLE OF MUSHROOMS QUITE HAPPY AGAIN AND EVEN SANG A SCRAP OF A COUNTRY DITTY IN A PRETTY BIRD-LIKE VOICE AS SHE CAME TO A BRAMBLE CLUMP AND WENT ON STAINING HER FINGERS
THEY'RE CHAPS THAT GOES ACROSS TO FRANCE AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND BRINGS SHIPFULS O THINGS OVER HERE YES THAT'S RIGHT
NOW WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DICK CRIED THE LAD
THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS TOO LATE FOR SIR RISDON HAD BENT DOWN RAISED HIS CHILD AND WAS ABOUT TO CARRY HER INTO THE HOUSE
WHAT DOES THE BOY WANT SAID THE PLUMP LITTLE LIEUTENANT MARCHING FORWARD
NOTHING ABOUT THE PLACE SHALL BE INJURED MADAM SAID ARCHY POLITELY
SHE RAN QUICKLY DOWN AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
HE PARTOOK OF HIS MEAL FEELING MORE DULL AND DISPIRITED THAN EVER AND A WALK AFTERWARDS TO THE LITTLE OPENING JUST BIG ENOUGH TO ALLOW OF HIS ARM BEING THRUST IN AFFORDED NO RELIEF
ARCHY WAS IN THE HIGHEST OF SPIRITS AND MEANT TO SEARCH EVERYWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE LEDGE SO AS TO COVER HIMSELF WITH GLORY IN THE EYES OF HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
THEY KNOW EVERY HOLE AND CORNER ABOUT HERE AND THERE'S NO KNOWING WHERE THEY'D HAVE LED US SAID A FAMILIAR VOICE
MORE THAN ONCE AS THE CUTTER RUSHED ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS HE FOUND HIMSELF WONDERING WHETHER AFTER ALL HE WAS WRONG AND THAT THE MAN HAD SLIPPED AWAY SO AS TO AVOID BEING RECOGNISED WHEN THE SMUGGLING VESSEL WAS CAPTURED FOR IF SEEN HE WOULD BE A MARKED MAN
HAH CRIED THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT
WHAT FOR SAID THE MAN ADDRESSED
HE TIGHTENED HIS BELT DREW HIS RED CAP DOWN ON HIS HEAD WISHED THAT HIS HANDS WERE NOT SO SORE AND MUTTERED THE WORDS NOW FOR LIBERTY HE BEGAN TO CREEP THROUGH THE HOLE TILL HIS HEAD WAS WELL OUT AND HE COULD LOOK ROUND FOR ENEMIES
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY NOW YES
WHOEVER YOU ARE GET A BOAT AND GO OFF TO THE CUTTER WHITE HAWK
VERY GOOD IDEA BUT YOU SEE WE DIDN'T MEAN YOU TO GET OUT LIKE THAT FEELING THAT HE WAS EXHAUSTING HIMSELF FOR NOTHING ARCHY CEASED HIS STRUGGLING AND WAS HELD THERE MOTIONLESS AS RAM CAME UP WITH THE LANTHORN TO BEGIN GRINNING
KEEP ON MY LADS
WELL IF I HADN'T YOU'D HAVE FOUND THE WAY IN YONDER AND I WASN'T GOING TO LET YOU IF I COULD HELP IT AH YOU'LL BE HUNG SIR GET OUT CRIED RAM
BUT YOU DON'T REALLY THINK AS HE HAS COME TO HARM I HOPE NOT DICK
NOW A HANDKERCHIEF SAID THE GRUFF VOICE
WE CAN'T LAND HER HE CONTINUED LOOKING UP AT THE TOWERING CLIFF AND OF COURSE WE CAN'T TAKE HER IN THE BOAT I'LL SOON MANAGE THAT SAID DICK LEAVING HIS ROWING TO TAKE UP A COIL OF ROPE HE HAD THROWN INTO THE BOAT AND MAKE A RUNNING NOOSE
NEVER MIND THE RABBITS LADS CRIED GURR ANGRILY
I SAY I GOT THIS ROPE
WELL EJACULATED RAM IN HIS FIRST MOMENT OF SURPRISE
YES CRIED ARCHY EAGERLY
A FEELING OF MISERY THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED CAME OVER ARCHY RAYSTOKE AS HE GRASPED THE POSITION AND HE WISHED THAT HE HAD NEVER UNDERTAKEN THE TASK HE HAD IN HAND
WELL IT'S ALL OVER WITH ANYTHING LIKE A SURPRISE HE CONTINUED AFTER A TIME AND WE MUST GET BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE WE STARTED FROM IF WE CAN FIND IT I'LL SWEAR THAT WAS RAM HE SAID AS HE TRUDGED ON UP A STEEP HILLSIDE
SO QUIET AND GENTLE WAS THE POOR CREATURE THAT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN PASSING THE NOOSE OVER HER HORNS MAKING THE LINE FAST TO A RING-BOLT SO AS TO KEEP HER HEAD WELL ABOVE THE SURFACE AND THEN DICK RESUMED HIS OAR
A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK THE MIDDY
AND RAM FOLLOWED HIM TO WHERE THE LITTLE FAT OFFICER STOOD NEAR THE HELM FROWNING
I DON BELIEVE SHE'D LIKE HER FATHER TO MISS GETTING A LOT OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM AND YOUR MADAM
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T ASLEEP AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK IT AREN'T MY FAULT
NOW THEN OUT WITH IT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR SKIN SKIN
I EXPECTED YOU SIR AND WHILE CONGRATULATING YOU AND YOUR MEN UPON THEIR SUCCESS I WISH TO HUMBLY OWN THAT MY PLACE HAS UNWILLINGLY ON MY PART BEEN MADE ONE OF THE STORES FOR THEIR NEFARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THE LIEUTENANT MOVED AWAY WITH SIR RISDON LEAVING ARCHY ALONE WITH CELIA AND HER MOTHER
THAT MY RAMMY CRIED MRS SHACKLE
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU
THERE I CAN SEE IT PLAINLY HUMPH
AND THOSE TWO THINGS WERE A BACKGROUND FORMED BY THE GREAT CLIFF DOWN WHICH HE HAD CREPT AND THE FEATURE WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT LIFE AND INTEREST--TO WIT THE FISHING-BOAT CONTAINING RAM AND JEMMY DADD
OUGHTN'T WE TO GO BACK HE PAUSED AS HE SAID THESE WORDS AND THEN LAID HIS HAND FIRMLY ON ARCHY'S SHOULDER
SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO BE DOWNSTAIRS WATCHING THE ACTS OF THE SMUGGLERS AND SHE DREADED TO MAKE A CONFESSION OF HER KNOWLEDGE OF THESE NOCTURNAL PROCEEDINGS
AND MOUNTED OVER THE BULWARK TO STAND BESIDE THE MAN AT THE HELM
FIRST ONE YIELDED THEN ANOTHER AND AS THEY WERE DRAGGED OUT THE MEN CHEERED AND PASSED THEM BACK TO THOSE DOWN THE ROUGH STEPS
AND IT WAS A PLAN
HOW IS YOUR HEAD NOW OH IT'S ALL RIGHT AGEN NOW MISS
COME ARTER SOME MORE MILK NO GROWLED GURR
I DO KNOW BETTER HE DOES NOT RECALLING THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF A GENTLEMAN ARCHY RAISED HIS HAT ADVANCED AND SAID APOLOGETICALLY WHO AND WHAT THEY WERE
PUTTING AWAY ALL THOUGHTS OF HER HOWEVER DIRECTLY AS HIS ANGRY FEELING INCREASED AGAINST RAM AND THIS TREACHEROUS GIRL
THAT CARGO MUST BE RUN TO EARTH BUT IS IT QUITE CERTAIN SIR THAT THERE WAS A CARGO RUN MY GOOD FELLOW CRIED THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT IMPATIENTLY IF YOU FOUND A SKIN LYING ON THE BEACH WOULDN'T YOU FEEL SURE THAT IT HAD ONCE HAD A SHEEP IN IT YES SIR IF IT WAS A SHEEPSKIN BAH
THEY DON'T CONSIDER ME FIT FOR SERVICE IN A CRACK SHIP
THERE AREN'T A PUBLIC-HOUSE FOR TEN MILES DIDN'T MEAN THAT THEN WHAT DID YOU MEAN
YES YOU WERE SIR AND IT WAS WICKED SMUGGLING
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES AS THE ENCOUNTER GREW MORE HOT AND THEY HELD ON TO EACH OTHER AND SWAYED HERE AND THERE ALL THOUGHT OF THE POSITION THEY OCCUPIED WAS FORGOTTEN
WHICH WAY DOES THE SEA LIE THERE WAS NOT A STAR TO BE SEEN AND THE NIGHT WAS DARKER THAN EVER
I FEEL AS IF I WAS GOING NOW SAID THE MASTER READY LADS
DIDN'T SAY PLUM DUFF
I KNEW HOW SAVAGE FATHER WOULD BE IF YOU GOT AWAY AND FETCHED THE SAILORS
WHERE WAS HE
LADYSHIP DON'T LIKE TO SEE YOU FUN IT IN NUMBER ONE WHAT SEE HER GOING ALONG THERE WITH THAT DOG
THAT WOULD ONLY SCARE HIM
LOOK HERE HE SAID
THEY'VE GOT A NOOK THERE I'LL BE BOUND AND AS SOON AS THEY'RE LANDED THEY'LL BE SCUFFLING UP THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF
WE LOST FOUR SHEEP LAST YEAR AND COME NIGH LOSING THE MISSUSES BEST COW NOT LONG AGO
HE COULD RECALL IT NOW
CLEAR AS COULD BE THEN SHE MAY COME
I AM NOT GOING TO BE LED TO ONE OF YOUR DISCOVERIES TO SEE NOTHING FOR MY PAINS THE DOG BARKED AGAIN ANGRILY AND NOT UNTIL SHE SPOKE SHARPLY DID HE OBEY AND FOLLOWED HER UNWILLINGLY UP THE SLOPE AND THEN DOWN INTO A HOLLOW THAT LOOKED AS IF AT ONE TIME IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BED OF SOME GREAT GLACIER
DUNNO MY LAD
DID YOU SEE HER AT SUNDOWN AY MY LASS
GAFFER SAYS IT'S LITTLE MISSUS'S AND YOU'RE TO TAKE IT UP OH THOUGHT RAM THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND HE BEGAN WHISTLING QUITE CONTENT AS THEY WENT WANDERING ABOUT MUSHROOMING TILL APPARENTLY TIRED THEY SAT DOWN CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE QUARRY WHERE JEMMY'S EYES ROLLED ROUND FOR A GOOD TEN MINUTES BEFORE HE SAID NOW THEN THE PAIR ROLLED OVER TO LEFT AND RIGHT DOWN INTO THE HOLE AND DESCENDED QUICKLY TO THE BOTTOM WHERE THE MAN CREPT RIGHT ON ALONG THE HALF CHOKED PASSAGE TOOK A LANTHORN FROM A GREAT CREVICE
CELIA HAD MADE HER OWN PLANS AND AS THE DOG COULD NOT COAX HER HIS WAY AND WOULD NOT GO ALONE HE HAD TO FOLLOW HER
I THINK IT WAS DOWN HERE HE STAMPED HIS FOOT ON THE LOOSE STONES AND THEN UTTERED A CRY OF JOY FOR THERE WAS A CURIOUS HOLLOW SOUND AND ON STOOPING DOWN HE PULLED AWAY SOME OF THE GREAT SHALEY FRAGMENTS AND LAID BARE A ROUGH PLANK WITH A BOLT PARTLY VISIBLE
YOU MUST NOT
I SAY--CASE THEY CAN'T MAKE A WAY OUT IN TIME--SHAKE HANDS ONCE MATE
BUT ALL DEPENDED UPON LITTLE IFS_--_IF HE COULD GET OUT THE STONE IF THE HOLE HAPPENED TO BE OPPOSITE THE SPOT WHERE THE CUTTER WAS MOORED IF THEY COULD SEE HIS SIGNALS
WE SHALL BE FRIENDS NOW
SILENCE SIR
SILENCE SIR
IN WITH THAT BOAT HE CRIED SHARPLY
THEN HE THOUGHT OF CELIA AND HOW BRIGHT AND INNOCENT SHE HAD SEEMED
HE IS ABOARD NOW,"--FOR JEMMY WAS ALREADY MAKING THE BOAT FAST--"HERE GIVE ME A CLEAN PAIL THE LITTLE COMMANDER OF THE CUTTER TRIED TO LOOK IMPORTANT AND ARCHY MORE SO BUT THEY FORGOT EVERYTHING DISCIPLINARIAN THE NEXT MOMENT IN THE INTEREST OF THE PROCEEDINGS AS JEMMY DADD TOOK THE BUCKET HANDED TO HIM TURNED ANOTHER UP BESIDE THE SIDE OF THE COW AND AS HE WAS SITTING DOWN DIRTY DICK DUG HIS ELBOWS INTO HIS MESSMATES RIBS RIGHT AND LEFT WHISPERED LOOK OUT
NO THEY HADN'T SEEN NO SAILOR LAD IN A RED CAP ONLY THEIR OWN BOYS AND THEY WERE ALL AT HOME
WASN'T GEESE
GRANTED
HANG THE BOY
THEN RELUCTANTLY BUT FEELING THAT IT MUST BE DONE ARCHY CLIMBED THE THIRTY FEET OF ROPE BETWEEN HIM AND THE GREAT LEDGE SLOWLY AND SURELY GLAD TO LIE DOWN AND CLOSE HIS EYES AS SOON AS HE WAS IN SAFETY SO FAR
I DO ASSURE YOU THERE'S NOTHING HERE BUT WHAT YOU MAY SEE IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH YOU'D KNOW SAID GURR GRUFFLY
TAIN'T CUT HE SAID LOOKING AT THE HAND HE DREW FROM THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
I COULD CARRY IT ON MY FINGER
JEMMY HELD OUT THE BASKET
NOW SIR TAKE OFF YOUR CAP SAID THE LIEUTENANT STERNLY
THAT DAY JEMMY DADD BROUGHT HIM HIS FOOD AND THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT
WELL YOU GIVE ME THAT LITTLE SWORD O YOUR'N NO
THEN TAKING DOWN A BASKET AS SHE MOVED INSIDE SHE BEGAN TO PACK UP THE VARIOUS THINGS IN THE DAIRY WHILE RAM LOOKED ON
WHY DIDN'T HE SAY OUT AT ONCE HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE AFFAIR AND SEND US ABOUT OUR BUSINESS AT THAT MOMENT HE FELT HIS SLEEVE PLUCKED AND TURNING ANGRILY ROUND HE SAW THE ELDERLY MASTER WHO HAD BEEN STANDING HAT IN HAND GREATLY IMPRESSED BY LADY GRAEME'S DIGNITY
HIS EFFORT WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY WELL SUSTAINED THOUGH FOR SUCCESS TO HAVE ATTENDED IT BUT FOR ONE FACT
IT DID NOT TAKE HIM LONG TO THINK ALL THIS
YOU ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE PLACE CERTAIN SIR GOOD
NO ONE HAD SPOKEN
WHERE IS IT THEN THE DOG LEAPED UP BARKED AND RAN A FEW YARDS TO STOP LOOK BACK AT HER AND BARK AGAIN
HOLLANDS GIN
THEY GET A SPAR OVER THE EDGE WITH A REG'LAR PULLEY AND LETS DOWN OVER THE BOATS AND THEN UP THE KEGS AND BALES COMES AH WELL WE MUST CATCH THEM AT IT SOME DAY DICK AND THEN THERE'LL BE LOTS O PRIZE-MONEY FOR YOU ALL AND FOR YOU TOO SIR
AND A LITTLE THINKING CONVINCED HIM THAT HE MUST BE SHUT UP IN ONE OF THOSE OLD QUARRIES WHICH HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY THE SMUGGLERS AS A PLACE TO HIDE THEIR STORES
I'D OVERHAUL HER MR GURR GOING TO MY LAD
THERE IT GOES
WELL SIR GO ON SAID THE LIEUTENANT--"SEEMS TO ME NOW MR RAYSTOKE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE CREAM AND FRESH BUTTER
I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL ABOUT CAREFULLY ALL OVER THE FACE OF THE STONES BEFORE HIM TO SATISFY HIMSELF BEFORE LONG THAT THERE HAD BEEN A LARGE ROUGHLY SQUARE OPENING HERE WHICH HAD BEEN FILLED IN WITH SOME PIECES OF STONE BETWEEN WHICH HE COULD FEEL THAT THERE WAS MORTAR
THE DOOR DRAGGED UP AND RAM WAS NOT ALONE FOR HIS VOICE COULD BE HEARD IN CONVERSATION WITH JEMMY DADD
NOW THEIR EYES BRIGHTENED WITH PLEASURE AS THE VERY SIGHT OF THE GLOWING ORB SEEMED TO HAVE A WARMING--AS IT CERTAINLY HAD AN ENLIVENING--EFFECT
I DID SEE THAT CRIED ONE OF THE MEN
EH AND THE GREAT FELLOW SEEMED TO TOWER OVER THE LITTLE COMMANDER
WHEW_--_WHEW_--_WHEW_--_WHEW
HE'S ON'Y A MIDDY.--NOW MY LADS,--NOW MY LADS PUT YOUR BACKS INTO IT WILL YOU THE BOAT WAS ALREADY SURGING THROUGH THE WATER FASTER THAN IT HAD EVER GONE BEFORE BUT THE MEN BENT LOWER AND THE LONGER AND THE BLADES OF THE OARS MADE THE WATER FLASH AND FOAM AS THEY DIPPED AND ROSE WITH THE GREATEST OF REGULARITY
HERE MY LAD WHERE'S YOUR MASTER EH I SAY WHERE'S YOUR MASTER AREN'T IN
DON'T SCARE THE BOY WITH THAT NONSENSE SAID THE FARMER ANGRILY
THEY WON'T SEE NO LANTHORNS I KNOW DUNNO THOUGH HE MUTTERED A LITTLE HIGHER UP
MIND HOW YOU PUT YOUR FEET AND TAKE CARE
WHAT IS YOUR NAME--NO NO STOP YOU TOLD ME BEFORE
THEN WHERE ARE THEY SIR I DON'T KNOW
SHOVE OFF DIRECTLY INTO THE FOG
ONLY A LOBSTER-BOAT AFTER ALL
AND AS IT LIT UP THE CEILING AND THE HUGE SQUARE STONE SUPPORTS OF THE PLACE HE SAW THAT WHICH EXPLAINED THE MEANING OF WHAT HAD SEEMED TO BE A WONDERFUL PHENOMENON
OF COURSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE DRIFT OF MY REMARKS FRAID NOT SIR SAID THE MASTER SMILING
SAVES THAT CHAP AND HERE AM I POST OF HONOUR DICK
SHAKES ONE SO
I SAY CRIED DICK EAGERLY SHALL I LASH HER LEGS WHAT FOR GROWLED JEMMY
YOU SEE I MUST MAKE MY REPORT OF COURSE JUST THEN THE OARS WERE THROWN UP AND LAID ALONGSIDE AND AS THE LIEUTENANT CAME TO THE GANGWAY ARCHY SPRANG ON TO THE CUTTER SO SHARPLY THAT HE CAME RATHER ROUGHLY IN CONTACT WITH HIS COMMANDING OFFICER
AND HE MOVED TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN DOWN AND UP THREE TIMES
THE ZIGZAG AND THE CLIFF-PATH HAD BEEN BAD BUT A FALL THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HOPELESS FOR THE UNFORTUNATE WHO LOST HIS FOOTING WOULD GO DOWN TO THE NEXT PATH OR THE NEXT A DOZEN PLACES PERHAPS OFFERING THE MEANS OF CHECKING THE DOWNWARD COURSE BUT UP WHERE THE BOY NOW STOOD WAS A SLOPE OF SHORT TURF WITH LONG DRY STRANDS WHICH MADE THE GRASS TERRIBLY SLIPPERY AND ONCE ANY ONE HAD FALLEN HERE AND WAS IN MOTION THE SLOPE WAS AT SO DANGEROUS AN ELEVATION THAT HE WOULD RAPIDLY GATHER IMPETUS AND SHOOT RIGHT OFF INTO SPACE TO FALL SIX HUNDRED FEET BELOW ON TO THE SHORE
SHE PRESSED HER HANDS TO HER TEMPLES AND TRIED TO THINK ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF THE PAST NIGHT AND BY DEGREES SHE COLLECTED HER THOUGHTS AND RECALLED THAT THE SMUGGLERS HAD COME TO TAKE UP THEIR KEGS AND BALES FROM THE TEMPORARY STORE TO CARRY THEM FURTHER INLAND THAT SHE HAD DISCOVERED THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN WATCHING AND TO SAVE HER FATHER SHE HAD SHUT THEIR ENEMY IN THE LOWER CORNER ROOM
YOU THINK YOU CAN FIND THE PLACE I DO NOT FEEL A DOUBT ABOUT IT SIR WELL IT'S GOING TO BE A DARK NIGHT AND YOU AND MR GURR WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OVER YOUR MEN
THINK SO RAYSTOKE SAID THE LIEUTENANT
THERE SHE CRIED JUMPING UP QUICKLY AND WIPING HER EYES
THEN ALL ROUND THE ROOM
SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A KEG OR BALE ON BOARD WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM AN EXCUSE FOR DETAINING HER
COME INTO MY CABIN SIR HE SAID IMPERIOUSLY AND AS HE TURNED AND STRUTTED OFF MAKING THE MOST OF HIS INCHES THE GIANT--FOR SUCH HE WAS BY COMPARISON--STUMBLED AFTER HIM MAKING THE DECK ECHO TO THE SOUND OF HIS GREAT BOOTS
THERE WAS NO TIME FOR THOUGHT ARCHY STOOD FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AS IF PARALYSED
GURR WHO LOOKED WONDERFULLY BULL-DOG LIKE IN ASPECT MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE FARM WHERE THE FIRST PERSON HE ENCOUNTERED WAS MRS SHACKLE WHO INNOCENT ENOUGH POOR WOMAN CAME TO THE DOOR TO BOB A CURTSEY TO THE KING'S MEN WHILE JEMMY DADD WHO WAS SLOWLY LOADING A TUMBRIL IN WHOSE SHAFTS WAS THE SLEEPY GREY HORSE STUCK HIS FORK DOWN INTO THE HEAP OF MANURE FROM THE COW-SHEDS RESTED HIS HANDS ON THE TOP AND HIS CHIN UPON HIS HANDS TO STARE AND GRIN AT THE SAILORS HE RECOGNISED
FOR AS A SHORT ENERGETIC LITTLE MAN HE MIGHT HAVE GAINED PROMOTION
BUT HE HAD TO DO IT
IT WAS GOOD ADVICE AND THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS PUTTING IT IN FORCE JUST AS GURR CAME TEARING UP
IT WAS AGONISING IN HIS LITERALLY STARVING CONDITION TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS AND HE TRIED TO KEEP HIS MIND UPON FINDING THE WAY OUT MEANING TO WORK DESPERATELY AFTER HE HAD LAIN DOWN FOR A BIT TO REST
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW SIR THAT YOU'LL BE SENT TO GAOL YES.--I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T HANG ME AND PRAY WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY FOR YOURSELF NOTHING THAT I KNOWS ON SAID RAM
IF YOU GO DOWN IT GETS SAFER BECAUSE YOU HAVE LESS HE FOUND THE WAY NOW COMPARATIVELY EASY FOR THE ROCK SLOPED A LITTLE OUT AND HE HAD EVEN GOT DOWN SOME SIXTY FEET WHEN HE HAD A CHECK
I ONLY SAYS WHERE'S THE BOAT NOW
THE GIG WAS RUN QUICKLY UP ALONGSIDE OF THE LEDGE AND DICK TOSSED IN HIS OAR SPRANG OUT SENDING THE CLEAR WATER SPLASHING WITH HIS BARE FEET AS HE CROSSED UP TO THE KEGS AND TAKING ONE UNDER EACH ARM WENT MORE SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY BACK TO THE BOAT WHERE HIS MESSMATES TOOK THEM CAREFULLY WITH MANY A CHUCKLE AND GRIN TO DEPOSIT THEM BESIDE THE OTHERS
THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FAMILIAR VOICE CRYING NO SHOTS LADS
THE BEARER OF THE LANTHORN WAS HIS YOUNG ENEMY--THE BOY
I WANT YOU TO BE EASY WITH THAT BOY
COME IN WITH THE TIDE BOUT LEVEN SAID RAM AS HE STILL DESCENDED THE FACE OF THE CLIFF THEN THE PATH AND AT LAST WAS WELL DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY WHOSE MOUTH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN FILLED UP IN SOME CONVULSION OF NATURE BY A HUGE WALL OF CLIFF UNDER WHICH THE STREAMLET WHICH RAN FROM THE HILLS HAD MINED ITS WAY
SURELY RISDON THEY WOULD NOT LADY GRAEME DID NOT FINISH BUT GAVE HER HUSBAND A PIERCING LOOK
LIKE A MONKEY YOU INSOLENT ARCHY CHECKED HIMSELF AND THE BOY LAUGHED
NOT I HE ADDED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THOUGHT
NOW HE GRUMBLED ABOUT HIS CORNS AND SAID HE NEVER SAW SUCH A ROAD
WHY I TRIED EVER SO LONG SAID DICK WHO COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM JOINING IN
HE HAD MANY NARROW ESCAPES FROM FALLS AND BLOWS AGAINST PROJECTING MASSES OF STONE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF AFTER HOURS OF WANDERING SO TIRED AND FAINT THAT HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE FOUND THE BASKET AND THE RESTING-PLACE
SHE SAW THEM AND HARDLY REALISING THAT THEY DID NOT SEE HER SHE WENT ON WATCHING THE REPTILE AS IT GLIDED WITH EASY SERPENTINE MOTION THROUGH THE GRASS
GOOD DAY
BUT THERE'S A BIT SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT THESE HERE PEOPLE AND ALL THE MEN THINKS SO TOO MORE SHAME FOR THEM SAID THE MIDDY QUICKLY
AN AWKWARDLY-SHAPED HIGH-BACKED CHAIR WITH ELBOWS AND CUSHIONS
THAT BOY IS AS CUNNING AS CAN BE
I TELL YOU IT'S SAFE ENOUGH
IF THE BRANDY AND SILK WERE GONE THE DOOR OF THE VAULT WOULD BE OPEN
WHY MY SKIN'S AS THICK AS ONE OF OUR BEASTS
TELLIN O YOU WHAT I WANTS DONE AND THEN YOU TELLS YOUR LADS THE LIEUTENANT NODDED AND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE SUGGESTION OF THE MAN THE STAY-SAIL WAS HOISTED
HERE YOU ARE SAID JEMMY DRAWING BACK AT LAST--WHILE DICK SEEMED TO BE WATCHING IN A STATE OF AGONY LEST A KICK SHOULD UPSET THE SOFT WHITE CONTENTS OF THE BUCKET--"MORE'N A GALLON THIS TIME
WARN'T THERE JEM YES GROWLED THE ROUGH-LOOKING FELLOW HALF-FISHERMAN HALF FARM-LABOURER
HE TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN HOPING AGAINST HOPE BUT WITHOUT RESULT
ALL GUESS-WORK MY LAD HE SAID
MAKE HER FAST ASTARN WELL YOU NEED NOT HAVE GOT INTO HER YOU COULD HAVE LED HER ROUND THIS HERE'S MY WAY SAID THE MAN
SATISFIED SAID THE LIEUTENANT AFTER ALL WERE ON BOARD AND HE HAD HEARD THE REPORT
THERE'S NOT A DOUBT OF IT MUTTERED THE LIEUTENANT
PUT HIM ON HIS BACK NO SOONER WERE THE WORDS UTTERED THAN AS HE STRUGGLED THERE IN THE BLACK DARKNESS ARCHY FELT HIMSELF TWISTED UP OFF HIS FEET
LET THEM TAKE IT ASHORE AY AY SIR STOP
HERE DICK GET BY ME AND GO FORRARD IF YOU CAN THERE WAS MORE SCUFFLING AND THE RATTLE OF A STONE OR TWO AS THE LISTENERS PICTURED IN THEIR OWN MINDS THE MAN SQUEEZING PAST THE MASTER AND HIS PRISONER AND THEN DICK'S VOICE CAME OUT IN A HALF SMOTHERED WAY
OH THEM
YOU ARE A CHEAT THOUGH ARE YOU NOT ME SIR
THE OTHERS WILL COME EASILY ENOUGH AND SO FULL OF HOPE HE KEPT ON TILL FEELING THAT IT MUST BE NEAR THE TIME FOR THE VISIT HE RELUCTANTLY CLOSED HIS POCKET-KNIFE AND WENT DOWN GAZING BACK FIRST AT THE TINY RAY OF LIGHT WHICH POINTED THE WAY TO LIBERTY
NO NO
AND I WARN YOU FELLOWS NOW I'D HAVE TREATED YOU EASY
THERE WAS A WAY INTO HIS PRISON AND THAT WAY HE VOWED SHOULD BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER BE HIS WAY OUT
PUPS CAN BITE HARD SOMETIMES JEMMY SAID RAM SLOWLY
THE HOZE YOU CALL IT DO YOU NOT CELIA GAVE A QUICK ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE NOD AS SHE RECALLED HOW SHE HAD LAIN IN HER CLOTHES AND LISTENED TO THE BUSY COMING AND GOING OF FOOTSTEPS FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT
CAN YOU LEAD US TO IT MY LAD BUT YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT AWAY WELL WE MIGHT CARRY ONE KEG ABOARD AS A SAMPLE
WHERE ARE YOU AT LAST
AND WE'D GOT OFF SO WELL HE MUTTERED
AND FACING DEATH AS HE WAS JUST THEN,--A HORRIBLE DEATH WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW AT ANY MOMENT,--THE LAD'S HAND GRASPED THAT OF HIS YOUNG GAOLER--OFFICER AND SMUGGLER BUT BOTH BOYS OF ONE BLOOD WHO HAD FOUGHT EACH ACCORDING TO HIS LIGHTS
HOW MUCH ARE WE TO LEAVE ABOARD ALL OF IT SAID RAM GENEROUSLY
LOOKING OUT FOR THE SCENE OF SOME OF YOUR OLD VILLAINIES NO SIR SAID THE MAN TOUCHING HIS CAP
WON'T DO LITTLE OFFICER
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING OF THE SORT DOWN YONDER CRIED DICK POINTING TO A SPOT WHERE THE GROUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUNK DOWN
AND NOW AS THEY DREW NEARER ARCHY SAW THAT HIS FIRST SURMISE WAS RIGHT
I'LL SINK THE FIRST SMUGGLER I MEET
YES YES RAM SAID THE GIRL HESITATINGLY AND GLANCING BEHIND HER THEN UP AT THE HOUSE WHERE ALL WAS PERFECTLY STILL
BUT IT WAS ONLY A SLIDE
CAN YOU WALK SAID ARCHY CUTTING HIM FREE
IT WAS INTENSELY HOT IN THAT HOLLOW FOR THE SEA BREEZE WAS COMPLETELY SHUT OFF BUT SHE DID NOT PAUSE AND RAPIDLY NEARED THE CLIFF NOW HER DREAD INCREASING AS SHE WONDERED WHETHER RAM WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GET A BOAT AND ROW ALONG UNDER THE CLIFF TO FIND THE POOR DOG'S BODY SO THAT SHE MIGHT BURY IT UP IN THE FIR-WOOD BEHIND THE HOUSE IN A PARTICULAR SPOT CLOSE TO WHERE SHE HAD SO OFTEN SAT
THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF MAGIC IN FOOD TO ONE WHO IS FASTING AND IS BLESSED WITH HEALTH AND A GOOD APPETITE
THERE'S A THREE-MASTED LUGGER COMING OVER FROM USHANT AND SHE MAY BE IN TO-NIGHT
BUT ARCHY LOOKED BACK SEVERAL TIMES AS THEY MARCHED DOWNWARD TO THE CLIFF AND THEN UP ITS STEEP GRASSY SLOPE TO SEE AT A TURN A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF BEING WAVED TO HIM
AND IT WAS DONE
HERE CHUCK THESE STONES INTO THE PASSAGE MY LADS AND THE ROUGH TRAP-DOOR WAS LAID BARE THE TWO BOLTS BY WHICH IT WAS SECURED WERE SEEN TO BE UNFASTENED AND THE LOCK UNSHOT
KEEP THAT DOOR SHUT AND YOUR MOUTH TOO BUT DO BE CAREFUL MASTER
WELL DONE MY LAD CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
WHAT IS IT A HAIL RIGHT IN THE DISTANCE NO SUCH LUCK MY LAD
THAT'S WHERE THE RACE IS AND IT WOULD CARRY YOU OUT TO--OH THE BOY WAS LOOKING DOWN BETWEEN HIS LEGS AS HE SPOKE
I DID AND THEY'RE COMING
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS SAID ARCHY TO HIMSELF
FIND THAT BASKET YOU GIVE TO FATHER JEMMY AY LAD HALF FULL O BRAMBRYS AND MASHEROONS
AH THERE YOU ARE
I MUST HAVE THAT DID YOU LOOK OVER THE CLIFF FATHER ASKED RAM
HANG THEM
THEY DESERVE IT FOR SAVING THE COW
FOR A VOICE CAME FROM ABOVE HIS HEAD GOT HIM RAM YES FATHER
HE DID KNOW THAT VOICE THEN
IF HE WOULD ONLY CATCH A FEW MORE HOW USEFUL THEY WOULD BE THEN SHE MOVED A LITTLE TO FOLLOW THE SLOW-WORM WHICH WAS MAKING FOR A PATCH OF HEATH AND SHE WAS STILL WATCHING IT WHEN SOME TIME AFTER GRIP CAME RUNNING UP QUICKLY SNARLING AND GROWLING AND PAUSING FROM TIME TO TIME TO LOOK BACK
THE SMUGGLERS ARE DOWN HERE AFTER ALL AND THEY LEFT THIS BOY BEHIND TO FASTEN THE DOOR AND COVER IT OVER WITH STONES UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF RAM THOROUGHLY ENDORSED THE MIDSHIPMAN'S WORDS BY GIVING AN ANGRY STAMP UPON THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE
FOR AWAY TOWARD THE FAR END OF THE CAVE THERE WAS A GREAT POOL OF FLICKERING BLUE LIGHT
HUSH
HUSH
HE'S A TARTAR
BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME YOUR WORD OF HONOUR AS A GENTLEMAN THAT YOU NEVER ENGAGED IN THESE CONTRABAND PRACTICES THESE WORDS REACHED THE LITTLE GROUP AND ALSO SIR RISDON'S REPLY
STAND ASIDE PLEASE
BUT THEY DID NOT FOR RAM ONLY LAUGHED AND WALKED AWAY
THE MATTER WILL BE THAT YOU TWO WILL BE HUNG AT THE YARDARM SOME FINE MORNING
TIS HORRIBLE
WHY THERE ARN'T A MORSEL O SAND FOR NOT PRAISING YOUR NASTY OLD FLAT SANDY SHORE WITH ITS MARSH BEYOND AND ITS AGUE AND BOGS AND FENS WISH I WAS MONG EM NOW SIR
THESE WERE SEIZED UNHITCHED AND AS THE BAG RAN DOWN A MAN KNELT FITTED A SHORT ROPE ABOUT THE KEGS AND HOISTED THEM ON HIS SHOULDER JUST AS THE MAN WHO HELD THE ROPE TROTTED UP OUT OF THE FOG INTO WHICH THE OTHER WITH THE KEGS DISAPPEARED
THAT'S BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE YOU DO THAT SAID RAM THOUGHTFULLY
THEN YOU KEEPS QUIET AND DON'T GIVE HIM NOTHING TO EAT AND AFTER A DAY OR TWO YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH HIM THEN WE'D BETTER TAKE BACK THE BASKET JEMMY EH AY LAD THAT'S IT
COME DID YOU SEE A FRENCH BOAT DOWN HERE LAST NIGHT NO SAID RAM
AND IT'S SO DARK I SHAN'T BE ABLE TO TELL WHICH WAY THEY HAVE GONE WHAT SHOULD HE DO
WE DAREN'T HAVE A SOUND NO REPLIED THE LIEUTENANT
ONCE MORE MY LADS TO SAVE BLOODSHED WILL YOU SURRENDER NO REPLY
OH YES
OH YES
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE TO TUMBLE HE SAID WITH A HALL LAUGH
HE DID NOT MIND LOADING A CART IF HE WERE ALLOWED AS MUCH TIME AS HE LIKED OR FEEDING THE PIGS BECAUSE IT AFFORDED HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAN OVER THE STY AND WATCH THE PRETTY CREATURES EAT WHILE THEIR GRUNTING AND SQUEAKING WAS SWEET MUSIC IN HIS EAR
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE TEN MEN TO CATCH A LOBSTER AHOY BO'S'N CRIED GURR
WHAT CRIED THE MASTER SHARPLY
THE MEN WERE NOT FORBIDDEN TO TALK AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GRASPING THE SITUATION WHILE THEIR COMMANDING OFFICER WENT UP AND DOWN THE DECK FUMING AND TAKING HIMSELF TO TASK MORE SERIOUSLY THAN ANY CAPTAIN HAD DONE SINCE HE FIRST WENT TO SEA
THEY'VE GOT HER THERE AND THE SAILORS ARE TRYING TO MILK HER THEN I WISH EM LUCK SAID JEMMY
THAT'S ENOUGH SIR
BUT NEVER MIND THE BEING PRISONER SIR
THEN HE WONDERED WHETHER HE COULD BACK SOFTLY AWAY
BUT HE HESITATED
TURNING SHARPLY HE LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM
I SEEM TO FEEL THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION ARCHY FELT THAT IT WAS THE WRONG DIRECTION BUT AT HE COULD NOT POINT OUT THE RIGHT HE FOLLOWED HIS LEADER FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE BOTH PAUSING TO SHOUT AND LISTEN FROM TIME TO TIME
I DON'T KNOW SAID ARCHY
BUT IT WOULD COME BACK AND THEY WOULD SEE HIS SIGNALS
AND IF I KETCHES HIM FERRETIN ABOUT THERE AGAIN I'LL DROP A BIG FLAT STONE DOWN ON HIM AND THEN CHUCK HIM OFF THE CLIFF IF YOU DO I'LL CHUCK YOU DOWN AFTER HIM SAID RAM
THEY WENT DOWN TO THE BOAT LAUNCHED HER AND ROWED OUT ALONG UNDER THE TREMENDOUS CLIFFS AND WERE ABOUT TO GIVE UP IN DESPAIR CONVINCED THAT THE UNFORTUNATE COW HAD BEEN SWEPT RIGHT OUT TO SEA WHEN RAM EXCLAIMED LOOK YONDER JEM WHAT FOR GRUMBLED THE MAN
THEY'RE FIGHTING THERE OH DEAR WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS THIS WAY GRUMBLED THE MASTER
JACK THE SAILOR IS EASILY PLEASED FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT ANYTHING IS A RELIEF FROM THE TEDIUM OF LIFE ON SHIP-BOARD
HAS IT MISSUS NO NEVER SAID MRS SHACKLE
JEMMY KNEW IT FELT THAT HE WAS LICENSED AND LAUGHED TO HIMSELF AS HE FOLLOWED HIS OWN BENT AND SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME EVERY DAY IN WHAT HE CALLED SEEING THE CROPS GROW
OH HOW TIRESOME SHE CRIED
VERY WELL
THOSE COWS LEFT OUT ON THE CLIFF FIELD ALL LAST NIGHT AND TALLY MUST HAVE GONE OVER FOR I CAN'T SEE HER ANYWHERE OH POOR TALLY
AND WHAT DID SIR RISDON SAY SAY
RAM HAD THROWN HIMSELF DOWN DRESSED AS HE WAS SO THAT AN INTERVIEW WITH A BUCKET OF WATER AT THE BACK DOOR AND A GOOD RUB WITH THE JACK TOWEL WERE SUFFICIENT TO BRIGHTEN HIM UP FOR THE BREAKFAST WAITING AND THE BOY WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE WAS PARTAKING HEARTILY OF THE BOWL OF BREAD AND MILK HIS MOTHER PLACED BEFORE HIM HIS FATHER MUTTERING AND GRUMBLING THE WHILE TO HIMSELF
LOOK HERE MR GURR WHAT AT MY LAD THE GRASS WELL WE WANT TO FIND SMUGGLERS NOT GRASS MY LAD YES BUT DON'T YOU SEE THAT SOME ONE HAS GONE OVER HERE LATELY
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO SAID THE LIEUTENANT SHARPLY
A GREAT MISTAKE
AS HE STOOD FACING THE ROCK HE FOUND DIRECTLY THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY FARTHER TO HIS RIGHT AND A LITTLE SEARCH PROVED THAT FROM THIS LEDGE HE COULD GET NO HIGHER NOT EVEN HAD HE BEEN PROVIDED WITH A LADDER
WELL YOU ARE A WONDER
AND AN END TO THIS WRETCHED WORK
OF COURSE I DIDN'T THINK IT
AND HE WAS ABOUT TO STEP CAUTIOUSLY BACK TOWARD THE DOOR WHEN ANOTHER THOUGHT SENT A SHUDDER THROUGH HIM
BAD JOB WE'VE NO LANTHORNS
I MAY AS WELL WAIT TILL I HEAR OUR MEN'S VOICES AND THEN I'LL SOON LET THEM KNOW WHERE I AM HE GOT ON HIS FEET FEELING STIFF AND UNCOMFORTABLE AND THEN TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHERE THE GRATED WINDOW WAS BUT THE DARKNESS WAS ABSOLUTE AND HE STRETCHED OUT ONE FOOT AND HIS HANDS AS HE BEGAN TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY ALONG FEELING HIS WAY TILL HE KICKED AGAINST A LOOSE STONE
SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU BUT OH SIR INTERRUPTED MRS SHACKLE SURELY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TUMBLE OVER MY HOUSE AGAIN
AND JUST AS A DULL THUD FROM SEAWARD TOLD THAT THE WHITE HAWK WAS STILL WELL ON THE HEELS OF HER QUARRY THE FIRST BOAT TURNED SMARTLY AND BEGAN TO CHASE
IT'S SO MUCH FLATTER
NOW LOOK HERE CRIED THE LIEUTENANT SHAKING HIS GLASS AT THE MAN DON'T YOU TRY TO DECEIVE ME
I CAN'T HELP IT MAMMA
BUT AS HE WENT ON AND ON AND WAS UNABLE TO DETECT A SOUND HE FELT THAT HE MUST BE WRONG AND STOPPED SHORT LISTENING INTENTLY
SEEM TO FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY ARE NEAR
IF WE ARE OBLIGED TO GO BY DAY THEY WILL HAVE GOOD WARNING AND BE PREPARED TO RECEIVE US THOUGH THEY MAY BE NOW
I'LL MEET YOU SOON AS IT'S DARK PISTOLS NO
NOW THEN ARE YOU READY AY AY CAME IN A LOW MURMUR
HERE COMES THE SUN HIS EYES BRIGHTENED AS HE WELCOMED THE COMING OF THE BRIGHT ORB INVISIBLE YET FROM WHERE HE STOOD
MUST BE UP EARLY
BE COOL IN DANGER_--_NEVER LOSE YOUR NERVE YES THAT WAS IT HE SAID AS HE RECALLED LESSONS THAT HE HAD RECEIVED AGAIN AND AGAIN
HE AREN'T HERE NO HE AREN'T THERE LAD SAID THE SMUGGLER WITH A LAUGH
I SAY THOUGH YOU--DID YOU--COURSE YOU DID
WANT TO FIND THAT BOY
WANT TO GROW INTO A JEMMY DADD NO FATHER THEN BE OFF THE BOY WENT OFF AT A RUN AND THE FISHER-FARMER LED HIS HORSE ALONG THE TWO RUTTED TRACKS TILL HE CAME DOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND THEN WENT ON AND ON TOWARDS WHERE A COUPLE OF MEN WERE AT WORK IN A FIELD DOING NOTHING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
THERE SIR RISDON
SHE HAS JUST GONE INTO THE MIST THERE MR RAYSTOKE SAID THE LIEUTENANT
I'VE COME AFTER OUR COW CHAPTER THREE
WHAT NOW THIS TO THE FAIR CURLY-HEADED LAD WHO CAME TROTTING UP ACROSS THE SHORT TURF
BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LIGHT CAME FROM BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE GRATED WINDOW WHILE ESCAPE FORWARD WAS IMPOSSIBLE AS HE WAS CLOSE TO A DOOR THROUGH WHICH SHADOWY FORMS WERE PASSING IN
ARCHY RAYSTOKE WAS FAST ASLEEP DREAMING ABOUT BEING ONCE MORE ON BOARD THE CUTTER WITH THE SUN SHINING FULL IN HIS EYES BECAUSE HE WAS LYING ON THE DECK RIGHT IN EVERYBODY'S ROAD AND GURR THE MASTER WAS SCOLDING HIM FOR IT IN A WAY WHICH WAS VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN WHILE THE MEN GROUPED AROUND GRINNED
I THINK I COULD FIND THE SOUTH IF YOU TOLD ME WHICH WAS THE NORTH SAID THE MASTER DRILY
THEY'RE GOING TO RUN ASHORE
AND IF THEY WERE MOVING THE CARGO I COULD SEE WHERE THEY TOOK IT AND THEN YOU COULD LAND THE MEN OH YOU'LL BE AN ADMIRAL BEFORE I SHALL BOY
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE SIR THAT FISHERMAN CHAP TOLD ME YOU SAID I WAS TO GO FORWARD SIR AS HE'D TAKE A SPELL NOW READY FOR RUNNING HER ROUND THE HEAD INTO THE BAY WHERE IS THAT MAN THERE WAS NO REPLY AND MORE QUICKLY THAN HE HAD MOVED FOR MONTHS THE LIEUTENANT TROTTED AFT AND LOOKED OVER THE STERN FOR THE FISHERMAN'S BOAT
SO LIGHT-HEARTED DID HE FEEL AS GUIDING THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE BY HIS FINGERS HE PICKED AND SCRAPED AWAY THAT HE BEGAN TO HUM A TUNE OVER SOFTLY
AND AFTER ANOTHER YAWN HE BEGAN TO STRIDE UP AND DOWN THE DECK OF HIS MAJESTY'S CUTTER WHITE HAWK LYING ABOUT A MILE FROM THE FREESTONE COAST OF WESSEX
TIDY SIR POOTY TIDY SAID THE SAILOR WHO HAD COME SLOWLY UP TO WHERE HE STOOD
BUT IF THE SMUGGLERS KILL YOU DON'T COME AND BLAME ME
DON'T MEAN HIM AS COME WITH YOU DO YOU I SAID A LAD BOUT SEVENTEEN IN A RED CAP LIKE YOURS SAID GURR VERY SHORTLY
YOU JEMMY DADD HULLO CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FRIGHTEN ME WITH SUCH TALK
WAS IT BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE YOU COME DOWN AND PULL ME ON HERE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE ME DO IT SAID ARCHY COLDLY
LEADING MEN AND LETTING THEM BOLT OFF IN ALL DIRECTIONS LIKE THIS
I KNOW IT'S HARD ON YOU BUT I'VE BEEN HERE A PRISONER EVER SINCE AND IT'S ENOUGH TO BREAK ONE'S HEART THE POOR FELLOW'S VOICE CHANGED A LITTLE AS HE SPOKE AND HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY IF HE HAD SEEN CELIA'S HEAD BOWED DOWN AND THAT SHE WAS CRYING BITTERLY
AND GRASPING THE MASTER'S HAND ARCHY LED ON FULLY BELIEVING THAT THE SMUGGLERS WERE STILL THERE BUT FEELING THAT THEY WOULD KEEP IN HIDING AND TRY TO ESCAPE WHEN THEY WERE GONE
ALL IN VAIN
IT'S AWFUL STRONG AND MIGHT KILL YOU STOP A MOMENT
IT WAS DARKER NOW FOR CLOUDS HAD COME LIKE A VEIL OVER THE BRIGHT STARS BUT THE NIGHT WAS SINGULARLY CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AS SOON AFTER EIGHT BELLS THE INFORMER CREPT SILENTLY UP TO WHERE THE LIEUTENANT WAS TRYING TO MAKE OUT THE APPROACH OF THE EXPECTED VESSEL
WORD OF HONOUR'S ENOUGH BETWEEN GENTLEMEN
IT ALL SEEMED VERY MATTER OF FACT NOW AS THEY ROWED IN THROUGH THE OPENING LEFT THE BOATS IN THE LITTLE POOL CLIMBED THE ZIGZAG
`RAM I SAYS TO MY BOY RAMILLIES `THINK SIR RISDON WOULD MIND IF I SENT HIM A FEW FISH UP TO THE HOZE `AY FATHER HE SAYS `THEY DON'T WANT US TO SEND THEM FISH
BUT AS HE WAITED AND SCANNED THE PLACE AROUND HE SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A RIFT AGAINST THE SKY IN THE EDGE OF A CLIFF WHICH ROSE UP RAPIDLY AND HIS HEART GAVE A GREAT THROB
FATHER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A BOTTLE OF CREAM MOTHER SAID THE BOY GRINNING
IF IT HAD BEEN FOR SILKS AND LACES I SHOULD HAVE SAID GO UPSTAIRS HE LED THE WAY TO A DOOR AT THE TOP OF SOME STONE STEPS
AND I FELT SORRY FOR HER AS ONE MIGHT FOR ONE'S SISTER AT HOME AND HUNG BACK FROM GETTING HER PEOPLE INTO TROUBLE
BUT THE MINUTE HE HEARD HIMSELF MENTIONED HE SHOWED HIS TEETH AND BEGAN TO GROWL FIERCELY AT THE MAN
THE LIEUTENANT AND ARCHY STOOD UP IN THE BOAT WATCHING AND DIRECTING AS DICK AND HIS COMPANION SEARCHED ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS ALONG THE LOWER LEDGE AND THEN MANAGED TO CLIMB UP TO THE ONE TWENTY FEET ABOVE WHERE THE NEXT MINUTE DICK GAVE A SHOUT
DON'T CHATTER
TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO-NIGHT THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
I SUPPOSE THE WATER'S PRETTY DEEP DOWN THERE THE LEDGE HE WAS NOW ON WAS FULLY A FOOT WIDE AND THE REFUSE AND FISH BONES WITH WHICH IT WAS STREWN TOLD PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT IN THE SPRING TIME IT WAS THE RESTING--PERHAPS NESTING--PLACE OF THE SEA-BIRDS WHICH SWARMED ALONG THE COAST
NOW AGAIN POW HOW HOWLED THE DOG RAISING HIS PAW NOW TO HAVE IT SEIZED BY THE BOY SQUEEZED AND THEN LOOSENED A TERMINATION WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE ANIMAL THE MOST PROFOUND SATISFACTION
GIVE US ONE COME SIR
YOU DICK FOLLOW ME
THE BUCKET FLEW ALONG THE DECK AGAIN AND DICK BOUNDED AWAY SAVING HIMSELF FROM FALLING THIS TIME AS HE WAS PREPARED AND MADE A SUDDEN LEAP BACKWARDS TO STAND WIPING THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD
THAT'S HIS NAME--RAM NONSENSE SIR
RAM'S FACE LOOKED GHASTLY AND HIS EYES WERE CLOSED
THE SCOUNDRELS HAVE HIDDEN THE THINGS SOMEWHERE UP IN THE WOOD BY THE HOUSE THINKING THAT NOBODY WOULD COME IN THERE TO SEARCH THE ARTFUL RASCAL SAID ARCHY TO HIMSELF FEELING BETTER NOW THAT HE HAD PUT THIS INTERPRETATION UPON THE PROCEEDINGS
IT'S BOB HARRIS SIR SAID THE LAST MAN THEY REACHED
THE CUTTER WILL BE SURE TO SAIL BY AND THEY COULD SEE ME IF I MADE SIGNALS FROM JUST HERE RATHER DOUBTFUL AS HE KNEW FOR HE WAS ONLY AT THE CORNER OF THE CHASM OR TINY GULF INTO WHICH THE SEA RUSHED AND THE CHANCES WERE THAT UNLESS HE HAD SOMETHING BIG AND WHITE TO WAVE HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO GET HIS SIGNAL SEEN
RAM STARED AT HIM HOLDING HIS HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THE WHILE AND A COUPLE OF MINUTES MUST HAVE ELAPSED BEFORE HE SAID WELL YOU ARE A RUM CHAP ARCHY GREW RED
WHAT WILL MR BROUGH SAY IF HE KNOWS HE THOUGHT AND THEN HE GROANED FOR THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE MOVEMENT WAS UNBEARABLE
HE'D LEND IT TO ME AND I'D SMUGGLE IT HERE SMUGGLE OF COURSE SNEERED ARCHY
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU BIT OF A TUMBLE FATHER THAT'S ALL SAID THE BOY CHEERFULLY AS HE PLACED HIS HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED THE MASTER
LOOK SHARP THE MEN GRINNED AND DIRTY DICK BY NO MEANS LOOKED SHARP BUT EXCEEDINGLY BLUNT AND FOOLISH AS HE SHUFFLED ALONG THE DECK PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH A BUCKET AND THEN APPROACHED THE COW WHICH HAD SUDDENLY BEGAN CHEWING THE CUD
I ASKED HIM YOU DID RAM YES I ASKED HIM--THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T BE FRIENDS AND SHAKE HANDS WHAT DID HE SAY CRIED ARCHY IGNORING THE LATTER PART OF HIS GAOLER'S REMARKS
I'VE BROUGHT YOU FOUR PLUM PUFFS AND A CREAM-CHEESE MOTHER MADE HANG YOUR PLUM DUFFS AND CREAM-CHEESES CRIED ARCHY STARTING UP IN A RAGE
I SAY HOW AM I TO GET HER HOME
I OUGHT TO HAVE ASKED YOUR LEAVE BAH
A COUPLE OF MEN WERE LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE BOATS THE OTHERS WERE FORMED UP AND AFTER PASSING THE COTTAGES OF THE FEW FISHERMEN OF THE PLACE THE PARTY STRUCK OFF FOR THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS TO FOLLOW THE RUGGED FAINT TRACK WHICH WAS MORE OFTEN LOST AND THE ARDUOUS TRAMP WAS CONTINUED HOUR AFTER HOUR TILL PARTLY FROM THE SCHOONER'S LIGHTS PARTLY FROM HIS IDEA OF THE RUN OF THE COAST THE LATE PRISONER BEGAN TO CALCULATE THAT THEY MUST BE APPROACHING THE LAND SIDE OF THE LARGE CLIFF
AND HE DROPPED DOWN RUSHED THROUGH THE BUSHES AND DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
BUT JUST THEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO HERSELF BY THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE DOG WHO ON SEEING HIS MISTRESS TALKING IN A FRIENDLY WAY TO THE STRANGER WHO HAD CHASED HIM HAD CONDESCENDED TO BE QUIET BUT NOW THAT A FRESH PARTY OF THE ENEMY WAS APPROACHING SET UP HIS BRISTLES AND BEGAN TO BARK AND GROWL FURIOUSLY
HE KNEW THE DIRECTION AND WENT ON WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS TO FIND THE WAY CHECKED DIRECTLY BY THEIR COMING IN CONTACT WITH ONE OF THE GREAT PILLARS OF STONE
AND LASTLY HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIS TROUBLES IN THE SOLACE HE FOUND IN A HUGE QUID OF TOBACCO WITH WHOSE JUICE HE PLENTIFULLY BESPRINKLED THE LEAVES OF THE BRAMBLES THAT WERE SPREAD ON EITHER SIDE
STRAIGHT ON SIR
I DON'T WANT TO TELL ABOUT YOUR FATHER BEING MIXED UP WITH THE SMUGGLERS YOU MUST NOT--YOU DARE NOT CRIED CELIA
THAT'S IT HE SAID AS HE CREPT OVER THE EDGE
AGAIN HIS VOICE SEEMED UTTERLY LOST IN THE AIR AND A PECULIAR QUERULOUS CRY FROM THE GULL WHICH CAME SLOWLY SAILING ROUND WAS ALL THE RESPONSE HE GOT
IT ALWAYS LOOKS SO EASY
THE BOY HAD SAID THAT IT WAS GONE
WHY THEY'RE COMING HERE TOO JEMMY SAID RAM AS THEY REACHED THE LEDGE AND LEAPED ON TO THE AMMONITE-STUDDED STONE OVER WHICH THE WATER GLIDED AND THEN RAN BACK
I CAN'T HAVE TRAILED OFF INTO ANOTHER ROAD CAN I HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE FELT QUITE STARTLED AND TURNED HOT
AT LAST JUST AT DAYBREAK THE CUTTER WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A DASH AND RUN RIGHT DOWN FOR HER OLD BERTH WHEN ONE OF THE MEN SHOUTED SAIL HO HE RAISED HIS GLASS AND THERE HULL DOWN WERE THE THREE MASTS OF A LUGGER A FRENCHMAN WITHOUT A DOUBT AND HIS SUSPICIONS HAD THEIR JUST CONFIRMATION
I KNEW ABOUT YOU BEING THERE BUT WE COULDN'T HELP IT AND RAM USED TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND HOW HE LIKED YOU
ARCHY WAS AS COURAGEOUS AS MOST BOYS OF HIS AGE AS HE WAS PROVING BY HIS ADVENTUROUS ACTS
I AM SURE YOU WOULD RAM SAT IN HIS OLD POSITION WITH HIS HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS ACHING HEAD
I'LL GET THE MEN TOGETHER AND WE'LL GO BACK TO THE PLACE AND SOON FIND IT
BUT I SAY HE IS TO SIR CRIED THE GIRL HAUGHTILY
THEY HAVE NOT EVEN APPOINTED YOU TO ANOTHER SHIP WELL IF YOU ARE GOING TO STAY IN THE WHITE HAWK SIR I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT TO CHANGE
IT'S ALL WERRY WELL FOR YOU TO LAUGH NOW IT'S DAYLIGHT AND THE SUN COMING OUT
BY PASSING THROUGH THE FIR-WOOD CELIA MEANT TO GET OUT OF SIGHT OF THE COTTAGES AND SHE WENT ON WITH THE DOG FOLLOWING SULKILY BEHIND BUT REVIVING A LITTLE UPON BEING GIVEN THE BASKET TO CARRY
WE'RE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE NOW
BUT THE SAID PAIN WAS INCREASING AND THERE WAS NO MISTAKING IT
WHAT CRIED THE PRISONER FIERCELY
DON'T HATE ME PLEASE
IF THEY WON'T SURRENDER YOU MUST FEEL YOUR WAY WITH THE PYNTES OF YOUR TOOTHPICKS THERE WAS A MURMUR OF EXCITEMENT AMONG THE MEN AND THEN GURR LEANED DOWN OVER THE HOLE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH AND SHOUTED BELOW THERE
BUT THE FIRST BOAT WAS GOING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE WATER NOW AND A TURN OF THE HELM CHANGED HER COURSE SO THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO CUT THE YAWL OFF FROM GOING IN THE NEW DIRECTION WHILE AN ATTEMPT TO PASS BETWEEN THE BOATS AND HEAD STRAIGHT FOR SEA WAS ALSO MET BY THE STEERSMEN OF THE PURSUERS
ARE NOT YOU THE MASTER AY MY LAD BUT I MEAN HIM YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR
AND THAT AREN'T THE WORST ON IT
WELL SIR WHAT ELSE CAN IT BE AH YOU OBSTINATE CRIED THE LAD
THE SKIPPER THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS WE MIGHT RUN AGAINST SOMETHING OR ANOTHER AND WE HAVE AND NO MISTAKE
NOT HURT ARE YOU NO NOT MUCH
HURRAH
HURRAH
HURRAH
WHAT ARE POVERTY AND DISGRACE TO THAT YOU ARE CRUEL SAID SIR RISDON BITTERLY
PITY HE DID NOT DO MORE AND NOT SAY SO MUCH SAID AS HIS DOOTY SIR AND WOULD YOU SEND THE BOAT FOR HIM IF YOU DID NOT THINK HE'D DONE RIGHT NO SIR
UNLESS I AM QUITE WRONG THE OLD QUARRY IS IN THAT GREAT CLIFF WHERE THE GRASS RUNS RIGHT UP TO THE EDGE THEN IF IT'S THERE AND THOSE FELLOWS HAVE GONE IN WE'LL FIND THE WAY AND GO IN TOO OH EJACULATED ARCHY STOPPING SHORT
I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN
NO SIGN OF GRIP
WHAT IS IT FOR ANSWER THE MIDSHIPMAN LEANED FORWARD AND POINTED TO WHERE FAR BACK AND APPARENTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CUTTER A COUPLE OF FAINT LIGHTS COULD BE SEEN HIGH UP AND AWAY FROM THE CLIFF
HOW DARE YOU SHUT ME UP IN THIS HOLE HUNG FOR SHUTTING YOU UP HERE CRIED THE BOY
HULLO SAILOR CRIED RAM
THE CUTTER WAS BACK NOT FAR FROM HER OLD MOORINGS AND THE GREAT CLIFFS OF THE SHORE WERE DIMLY VISIBLE
DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A SOFT GLARE THE LANTHORN APPEARED LIKE SOME CREATURE OF LIGHT SWAYING AND FLOATING TOWARDS HIM IN THE DARKNESS TILL IT STOPPED CLOSE BY AND RAM'S NOW FAMILIAR VOICE EXCLAIMED HULLO THERE
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT'S THE WAY DOWN TO THEIR CURIOSITY SHOP AND THEY'RE HIDING IN THIS HOLE HERE THEN THRUSTING IN HIS HEAD AND HOLDING ON BY THE RUGGED STONES HE SHOUTED INTO THE HOLLOW PASSAGE NOW THEN MY LADS OUT YOU COME A PAUSE
SEE YOU FOR NOTHING MIDDY
GENTLEMAN YOU SEE DON'T BE ALARMED SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN QUIETLY
HERE YOU SIR CRIED ARCHY AS THE BOY FACED ROUND
YOU SIR RAM GOT UP WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WENT DOWN TO THE BOAT
WE'VE GOT LOTS O FOX-WHELPS AS WE MAKE CIDER OF AND SOME RED-CHEEKS WHICH ARE EVER SO MUCH BETTER
I SAY SIR I HAVE ONLY ONE ORDER TO GIVE YOU
WELL WAIT TILL YOU BECOME A POST-CAPTAIN AND I HOPE I SHALL BE AN ADMIRAL BY THEN AND THAT YOU WILL ASK ME TO HONOUR THE WEDDING HUSH PRAY SIR SAID ARCHY
RAM DID NOT LOOK A BIT AFRAID BUT HE DOFFED HIS RED CAP
MORNING MARM SAID GURR
WHAT HE DID SEE WAS RAM'S FRANK-LOOKING RUSTIC FACE CLOSE UP AND A HAND WAS REACHED OVER THE EDGE
THE NEXT MOMENT HE REALISED THAT HE HAD REACHED A DOOR WHICH WAS YIELDING AND HE PASSED INTO A ROOM TO SCENT THE COOL NIGHT AIR AND HEAR SUBDUED SOUNDS WITHOUT AND BELOW
THE DESCENT WAS NOT DIFFICULT AND AFTER THE FIRST FEW STEPS THE FEELING OF TIMIDITY BEGAN TO WEAR OFF AND CELIA DESCENDED MORE QUICKLY TILL ABOUT FIFTY FEET FROM THE TOP SOME DISTANCE UNDER WHERE THE FRINGE OF FERNS HUNG AND WHERE IT HAD SEEMED QUITE DARK FROM ABOVE BUT WAS REALLY A PLEASANT GREENISH TWILIGHT SHE FOUND BENEATH HER FEET A FEW LOOSE FLAT STONES PART OF A QUANTITY LYING BEFORE HER IN THE ARCHWAY THAT SEEMED TO LEAD STRAIGHT ON INTO THE QUARRY
YOU SIR HE SAID GOING TOWARDS WHERE JEMMY STOOD GRINNING
DRESSED UP WITH A DIRTY FACE AND A BIT O CANVAS
YOU SIR
WHAT'S THE GOOD O SHORE-GOING
LOOK HERE BOY DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SMUGGLERS WHAT DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SMUGGLERS YES LOTS O TIMES SAID RAM GLIBLY
THE CARGO'S THERE FOR CERTAIN
I SAY SHOW ME THAT THE COW IS YOURS AND YOU SHALL HAVE HER OH CRIED RAM AND HE RAN TO THE SIDE UNFASTENED THE ROPE USED AS A HALTER FOR THE PATIENT BEAST RAN RIGHT FORWARD AND BEGAN TO CALL TALLY TALLY
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN AND GO TO BED
WELL NO I SUPPOSE NOT
THEY DARE NOT HURT ME
WE NEVER GOT SIGHT OF HER THEN YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP CRIED THE LIEUTENANT ANGRILY
BE OFF BOY RAM PUT ON HIS RED CAP TOOK THE BASKET AND TROTTED OFF TOWARD THE HOZE WHILE MRS SHACKLE SIGHED FOR SHE KNEW THAT SOMETHING PARTICULAR MUST BE ON THE WAY OR RAM WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SENT OFF AND HER HUSBAND HAVE PREPARED TO GO OUT DIRECTLY AFTER
IT'S WHEN IT'S ALL BLACK AS PITCH AS IT TAKES HOWD ON YOU WORST YOU'RE A GREAT BABY DICK CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN AS HE WENT TO THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER AND LOOKED OVER THE LOW BULWARK TOWARD THE EAST
AND ONCE MORE HE SUMMONED THE SMUGGLERS TO GIVE IN
DON'T HEAR ANY OF THE OTHERS THOUGH HE SHOUTED AGAIN AND AGAIN GETTING ANSWERS AND GRADUALLY DIMINISHING THE DISTANCE TILL HE SAW DIMLY THE FIGURE OF A STOUTLY BUILT MAN AND THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS SALUTED WITH OH IT'S YOU IS IT MR RAYSTOKE
BUT THE WIND WAS DEAD AHEAD NOW AND THOUGH THE WHITE HAWK COULD USE HER WINGS WELL EVEN IN SUCH A BREEZE AND SAIL VERY CLOSE IT WAS FAR DIFFERENT WORK GETTING BACK TO COMING AWAY
WE TRIED TO GET OUT TO HER BUT THE SKIPPER SENT A SHOT AT US AND WE CAME BACK HERE ONLY YOU SAW US AND RUN US DOWN WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE YOUR MEN ARE NOW ASKED ARCHY
HOW ABOUT THE TIDE JEMMY SAID RAM WHEN THEY HAD BEEN ROWING A FEW MINUTES WITH THE COW STANDING PLACIDLY IN THE BOAT
THEY KNOW THE WAY AND THEY'D SEE THE SIGNAL S'AFTERNOON HE WHISTLED SOFTLY AS HE WENT ON HIGHER LAUGHING ALL AT ONCE AT AN IDEA WHICH STRUCK HIM
WHAT AN IDIOT I AM FOR AN OFFICER HE CRIED
WALKING ON THE SIDE TURF SAID ARCHY TO HIMSELF AS HE KEPT ON TO FIND AFTER A FEW MINUTES THAT THE STONE WALL ON HIS LEFT HAD CEASED BUT HE COULD FEEL THAT THE ROAD WENT ON AND HEARD THE PEOPLE COMING
THOSE WHO HAD ESCAPED RELATING AGAIN TO THOSE WHO WERE ON THE CUTTER THEIR TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES BEFORE THE POWDER CAUGHT
BIT COCKY AND NOSE IN AIR WHEN HE'S IN FULL UNIFORM AND DON'T KNOW WHICH IS HEAD AND WHICH IS HIS HEELS BUT HE AREN'T SUCH A VERY BAD SORT O BOY
HULLO MY LAD WHO ARE YOU TAKE THIS OFF PANTED ARCHY IN A STIFLED VOICE
SHE WAS ABOUT A MILE AWAY AND WELL IN TOWARD THE SHORE KEEPING FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CLIFFS TO CATCH THE LAND BREEZE AND NOW AS THE TASK OF CATCHING UP THE CUTTER WAS GIVEN UP AS IMPOSSIBLE THE BOAT TOOK THE ATTENTION OF ALL
WHILE AS IF THE DARKNESS WERE THE SAME TO HIM AS THE LIGHT THE SMUGGLER SAID LACONICALLY GOING BACK TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND DISAPPEARED IN THE BLACK GLOOM
WENT AFT SIR CAME FROM EVERY ONE HE ENCOUNTERED
THEN KEEP UP THIS WAY AND BE READY FOR ANOTHER RUSH AY CRIED THE MASTER LOUDLY
WHAT'S IN THOSE KEGS I KNOW CRIED RAM SHOWING HIS TEETH AND LOOKING AT ARCHY
PASS THE WORD TO THE BO'S'N TO LOOK OUT
ARCHY WAS SHADING HIS EYES JUST THEN AND POINTING OUT SOMETHING TO THE LIEUTENANT A LITTLE TO THE LEFT OF WHERE RAM AND HIS COMPANION WERE SEATED AND THE BOY'S EYES TRAINED BY HIS NEFARIOUS HABITS GAZED SHARPLY IN SEARCH OF DANGER OR CRIMINATING EVIDENCE IN THE DIRECTION THE MIDSHIPMAN POINTED
IF YOU WILL PAY US A VISIT ON THE CUTTER WE SHALL BE ONLY TOO PROUD TO SEE YOU A FRIENDLY SALUTE WAS INTERCHANGED AND ARCHY EMPHASISED HIS BY HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO CELIA
OH GRIP GRIP
WHAT SHALL I DO THOUGHT THE WATCHER
AND HE DID THE MILKING BECAUSE HE COULD SIT DOWN AND REST HIS HEAD
THEY'RE MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THE LEDGE AND THERE IS NO ONE TO BUY LOBSTERS THERE AY AY SIR THAT FAMILIAR SEA-GOING REPLY SEEMED TO RING OUT OF THE LAD'S THROAT AND AFFORDED HIM A PURE FEELING OF DELIGHT
DON'T THEY KNOW THAT YOU ARE HERE NO BUT YOU WILL GO AND TELL ALL YOU HAVE FOUND OUT YES SAID ARCHY SLOWLY AS HE STRAINED HIS EYES TO TRY AND MAKE OUT THE SPEAKER
SAYS HE DON'T LIKE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH A LAD LIKE ME SAID RAM LAUGHING
WELL GO BACK
AND I SHAN'T HAVE MISS CELIA'S DOG TOUCHED HO
THAT WAS ALL
AND THEN AS THE SACK WAS DRAGGED OVER HIS HEAD HE UTTERED A SIGH AND STAGGERED AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN HAD NOT ONE OF THE MEN CAUGHT HIM
MAKE FAST HER PAINTER TO THE RING-BOLT HERE THIS WAS DONE A FRESH ORDER GIVEN AND WITH THE ROUGH BOAT AND COW IN TOW THE GIG BEGAN TO MAKE SLOWLY FOR THE CUTTER
BUT WITH THAT WE HAVE AT PRESENT NOUGHT TO DO
THIS HERE ROAD'S NOT THE CUTTER'S DECK THE LAST ORDER WAS NOT NEEDED FOR THE MEN MARCHED ON CHEERFULLY AND WELL TILL THEY HAD PASSED ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE HIGH CLIFF WHERE RAM HAD DISPLAYED HIS LANTHORNS AND FOLLOWING THE ROUGH ROAD CAME AT LAST TO THE SCATTERED COTTAGES OCCUPIED BY SHACKLE'S MEN AND THOSE WHO HAD ONCE BEEN SERVANTS AT THE HOZE BEFORE IT HAD SUNK DOWN IN THE WORLD CONSEQUENT UPON ITS MASTER'S HAVING ESPOUSED THE WRONG SIDE AND ITS SERVANTS WERE REDUCED TO ONE OLD WOMAN
THE EXERTION OF MOVING THE HOOP MADE HIM WINCE FOR HIS BACK WAS SORE AND HIS ARMS FELT STRAINED AS IF HE HAD BEEN BEATEN
WELL IT WOULD BE STOOPID IF I WAS TO TURN DIZZY AGAIN
AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY ARCHY AND HIS MEN HE DESCENDED INTO THE OLD QUARRY AND THEN STOOD LISTENING AT THE TOP OF THE SLOPE BEFORE PREPARING TO ADVANCE INTO THE ENEMY-PEOPLED DARKNESS RIGHT AHEAD
IS THERE ANY CONTRABAND ARTICLE STORED ABOUT THE FARM NO SIR AND NEVER WAS HUMPH
BUT ALL RIGHT
EVERYTHING WAS ARRANGED ON BOARD SO THAT NO WATCHER ARMED WITH A GLASS WHO SCANNED THE SHIP SHOULD SUSPECT THAT AN EXPEDITION WAS ON HAND
OH IT'S BEYOND ANYTHING
FOR A WORSE TROUBLE HAD DISCOVERED ITSELF
YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME YES I'LL FRIGHTEN THE WHOLE LOT OF YOU
YES OF COURSE SAID THE FARMER IN ASSENT
I MUST HAVE JUST NODDED OFF TO SLEEP
HE WOULD BE A PRISONER AND DISCOVERED BY THE INMATES IN THE MORNING
STILL HE DETERMINED TO TRY AND AFTER A HASTY MEAL DIRECTLY HIS GAOLERS HAD PAID THEIR LAST VISIT HE STARTED OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT WHICH LED TO THE TRAP-DOOR AND PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO KEEP ON THROWING PIECES OF STONE BEFORE HIM TO SATISFY HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO WELL OR PIT IN HIS WAY HE WENT ON AND ON
YES I SHALL SET THAT DOWN TO YOU RAMILLIES
I CAN SEE IT ALL NOW
SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE NOTHING LEFT NOWHERE
WHAT BOAT'S THAT SHOUTED THE MAN ON THE WATCH
COME COME SAID THE LIEUTENANT WIPING HIS EYES AND TRYING TO LOOK VERY IMPORTANT AND STERN THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY MY MAN
TAIN'T AS IF WE WERE OBLIGED TO MOVE EM TO-NIGHT
WHERE GURR CRIED ARCHY WHO WAS GROWING FAST AND WANTED MATERIAL TO HELP NATURE
IT'S ALL OVER NOW THE ROPE WAS MADE FAST AND BY ITS HELP THE MEN EASILY REACHED THE GREAT LEDGE RAM COMING DOWN SOON AFTER WITH THE COILED-UP ROPE ABOUT HIS SHOULDER AND UNDER ONE ARM
AM I NEVER TO SEE THE BRIGHT SUN AND THE SPARKLING SEA AGAIN HE SAID SADLY
I TELL YOU I MUST
IT IS SOME POOR FELLOW FALLEN DOWN AND PLACING HER BASKET BY THE SIDE SHE BEGAN TO DESCEND CAUTIOUSLY WITH GRIP RUSHING TO MEET HER BARKING NOW JOYOUSLY AND UTTERING WHINE AFTER WHINE
LEAVE OFF WILL YER CAME ROUGHLY TO HIS EARS AND ROUSED HIM TELLING HIM THAT THE BOY WAS NOT DEAD
GOING TO GIVE ME THAT BASKET NO THEN YOU SHAN'T HAVE THIS
HE HAD GONE UP THE SLOPE TWICE AND THE LAST TIME CREPT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT RAM WAS CLIMBING UP A WELL-LIKE SHAFT BY MEANS OF RUGGED PROJECTIONS IN THE WALL THAT AS HE GOT ABOUT TWENTY FEET UP HE HANDED THE LANTHORN TO THE MAN CLIMBED OUT THROUGH A SQUARE OPENING AND THEN A TRAP-DOOR WAS SHUT DOWN LOCKED AND BOLTED AND WHAT SOUNDED TO BE A NUMBER OF HEAVY PIECES OF STONE WERE DRAWN OVER
PUT OUT THE BREAD AND CHEESE MISSUS AND I'LL GO AND DRAW A DRINK OR TWO
IT'S NO USE TO ASK YOU BOUT WHERE YOU ARE GOING FIRST SIR WHISPERED THE MASTER BECAUSE I SUPPOSE IT WILL ALL BE CHANCE
I SHOULD ONLY SEE SOME OF OUR CHAPS AND IT WOULD LOOK AS IF I'D BEEN SPLITTING ON THEM
WELL MR RAYSTOKE WHERE'S THE BOAT DON'T KNOW SIR
IT WAS TOO SOON FOR HIM TO BE STIRRING YET AND DETERMINING AT LAST TO GO AND DECLARE HIS INNOCENCY AND MAKE AN APPEAL TO THE FRANK-LOOKING LAD SHE CREPT TIMIDLY DOWN THE GRAND OLD FLIGHT OF STAIRS TRYING TO THINK OUT WHAT SHE WOULD SAY
BUT TAKE DOUBLE LOWANCE TO-MORROW SO AS NOT TO GO EVERY DAY VERY WELL FATHER
WHAT SHALL I DO THOUGHT THE MIDSHIPMAN
AND ALL THE WHILE THE REGULAR PAT-PAT OF FOOTSTEPS CAME FROM HIS RIGHT BUT NOT AS HE HAD COME FOR THE SOUND WAS AS IF SOME ONE WAS APPROACHING BY A ROAD WHICH CAME AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE ONE HE WAS IN
YES GROWLED THE FARMER
TOO MUCH EXERCISE OF THE STRENGTH WHICH HAD BEEN GROWING LATENT MIGHT MEAN BREAKING HIS KNIFE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF HIS HOPES
GOOD-BYE HE WHISPERED AND GLIDING OVER THE SIDE HE SOFTLY WADED ASHORE AND STOOD ON THE BEACH
WELL I DON'T SAY IT WARN'T ME
QUITE BAD ENOUGH THOUGH
HE HAD ME SENT HERE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT GET INTO TROUBLE INDEED NO
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.--YES IT IS MY LAD
YOU SHALL HAVE FIVE POUNDS IF YOU'LL LET ME GO NOW AT ONCE THERE'S AS MUCH AS YOU'LL EAT TILL I COME AGEN SAID RAM ABRUPTLY
AND RUNNING AFT HE DESCENDED INTO THE CABIN AND RETURNED WITH A GLASS WHICH HE FOCUSSED AND GAZED THROUGH AT THE OBJECT RISING STEADILY AND FALLING WITH THE HEAVE OF THE SEA
WAS YOUR CUTTER CLOSE UNDER SO AS SHE FELL ON DECK OF COURSE NOT BUMPKIN SAID ARCHY IMPATIENTLY AS THE MEN BURST INTO A GUFFAW AND THEN LOOKED HORRIBLY SERIOUS AS IF THEY HAD NOT SMILED
RAM CAME UP TO HIM WITH HIS BASKET BUT JUST AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING SHACKLE CALLED HIM AWAY AND ONCE MORE THE PRISONER WAS LEFT ALONE
THERE'S A BOY THERE THAT YOUNG RASCAL WHO CAME AFTER THE COW
STILL ARCHY TOILED ON THE STONE HE HAD ATTACKED AS TIGHT AS EVER BUT QUITE A LITTLE HEAP OF ROUGH MORTAR INCREASING BENEATH WHERE HE KNELT
I SAY THOUGH YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU COULD GET AWAY DOWN HERE DID YOU MEANT TO TRY SAID ARCHY LACONICALLY
I WONDER HOW LONG I SHALL BE A PRISONER HE SAID ALOUD
AND THEN PLACING HIS FOOT AGAINST THE STROKE OAR HE GAVE A REGULAR THRUST WITH THE MAN'S PULL A PLAN IMITATED BY THE BOATSWAIN ON BOARD THE OTHER BOAT
STUPID DOG SHE SAID TO HERSELF WITH A LITTLE LAUGH
AH MASTER SHACKLE HE SAID STARTING SLIGHTLY ON BEING ADDRESSED
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
I'LL TAKE YOUR REPORT DIRECTLY MR GURR HE SAID
YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT AND YOU'D CALL ME A MISERABLE SNEAK I SHOULDN'T THEN YOU'D THINK I WAS AND I SHOULD KNOW IT SO IT WOULD BE ALL THE SAME THEN YOU WILL NOT HELP ME CAN'T YOU WILL NOT YOU MEAN SAID ARCHY BITTERLY
THEN HE BURST INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER WHICH ECHOED FROM THE ROOF
IN FACT TO THE GREAT DELIGHT OF ALL IT WAS FOUND THAT THOUGH A GREAT DEAL OF DESTRUCTION HAD BEEN DONE THERE WAS AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF THE SMUGGLERS STORES LEFT TO WELL LOAD THE CUTTER TWICE
GIVE HIM YOUR PAW WHAT FOLLOWED SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME TO THE BOY FOR IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS MISTRESS'S ORDERS THE DOG LIFTED HIS LEFT PAW AND TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY TO GAZE UP AT HIS MISTRESS
I'D HAVE THEM DOWN AND NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TIME JUST HAVE DOWN ALL YOUR CANVAS AND GET IT TANNED BROWN
A LOVELY MORNING INDEED AY THE MORNING'S RIGHT ENOUGH SIR RISDON
COME COME MY LADS NO NONSENSE
HERE CAME DISAPPOINTMENT THE FIRST
CAME THE REPORT OF A HEAVY GUN
AS HE THOUGHT HE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY ON WONDERING WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO AND SEEING AT LAST A BRIGHT LIGHT IN FRONT HIGH UP A SLOPE AND ANOTHER AWAY TO HIS RIGHT MUCH HIGHER
BE SMART MY LADS
HUMPH
HUMPH
WHAT BO'S'N YES SIR AND ME TOO
THE PERSON BLENHEIM SHACKLE--FARMER AND FISHER IN HIS CANVAS SAILOR'S BREECHES BIG BOOTS STRIPED SHIRT AND RED TASSEL CAP--HAD ACCOSTED WAS A TALL THIN ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING GENTLEMAN IN A BROAD-SKIRTED SHABBY BROWN VELVET COAT WHO WAS DAINTILY PICKING HIS WAY CANE IN HAND OVER THE SOFT TURF OF THE FIELD EVIDENTLY DEEP IN THOUGHT BUT SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE TO WHAT WAS AROUND TO MAKE HIM STOOP FROM TIME TO TIME TO PICK UP A GLISTENING WHITE-TOPPED MUSHROOM AND TRANSFER IT TO ONE OF HIS POCKETS WITH A SATISFIED SMILE
BE QUIET SIR AND GOING TO SAY LITTLE MISSUS THAT IF THAT THERE DOG COMES HANGING ABOUT HERE HE'LL GO OVER THEM THERE CLIFFS AS SURE AS BUTTONS AND NEVER BE SEEN NO MORE COME AWAY GRIP
IT WOULD ONLY BE HINDERING HER TOO
THAT ALL MISS NO SAID THE GIRL STILL HESITATING
IMPOSSIBLE SHOUTED THE LIEUTENANT
YOU ARE TO SEARCH AND FIND THE PLACE AND IF FOUND HOLD IT BUT IF YOU DO NOT FIND IT YOU WILL BE BACK ON BOARD BY DAYBREAK AND ANOTHER EXPEDITION MUST BE MADE BY DAY
THEN THERE WAS A SHARP SOUND AS IF A HEAVY STONE HAD FALLEN UPON A HEAP AND HE HEARD IT RATTLE DOWN TO THE SIDE
HE DID LEARN THAT THE CUTTER HAD JUST RETURNED AND GONE AWAY AGAIN
OH YOU NEEDN'T TALK WITHOUT YOU LIKE BUT THEY DIDN'T FEED YOU UP ABOARD SHIP LIKE YOU'RE GETTING IT NOW I KNOW
NO NO MY LAD SAID GURR KINDLY AS HE JOINED HIM
HOW LONG HAS THAT SIR RISDON GRAEME BEEN A SMUGGLER HIM
HE FELT BETTER AFTER THAT AND FELL TO WONDERING WHY HE HAD BROUGHT HIS LITTLE HOOP TO BED WITH HIM AND ALSO HOW IT WAS THAT HIS LITTLE HOOP WHICH HE USED TO TRUNDLE HAD BECOME IRON INSTEAD OF WOOD
AND TAKING OUT HIS KNIFE FORCING HIMSELF TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK EACH DAY THAT THE LAD CAME AND IF SO AS IT WAS ABOUT SIX HOURS AS NEAR AS HE COULD GUESS SINCE THE BASKET WAS BROUGHT HE HAD ABOUT A COUPLE OF HOURS MORE DAYLIGHT THEN THE LONG NIGHT AND ALL THE MORNING BEFORE HIS GAOLER WOULD COME AGAIN
HAH SIGHED RAM AS HE GRIPPED HARD AND THEN LET GO
NOW THEN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
THE SILENCE WAS ASTONISHING CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF WORK BEING DONE AND THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH ALL WENT ON
FARMER SHACKLE WAS QUITE RIGHT FOR IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE A BOAT WELL-FILLED WITH MEN UNDER THE COMMAND OF THE MIDSHIPMAN AND THE MASTER PUT OFF FROM THE CUTTER AND BEGAN TO ROW WEST TO THE LITTLE COVE THROUGH WHOSE NARROW ENTRANCE A BOAT COULD PASS TO LIE ON THE SURFACE OF A CUP-SHAPED DEPRESSION AT WHOSE HEAD A LIMPID STREAM OF WATER GURGLED OVER THE CLEANLY-WASHED SHINGLE BELOW THE GREAT CHALK CLIFFS
CELIA STOOD WITH HER CHEEKS BURNING TREMBLING AND ANXIOUS AND AFTER BATHING HER FACE AND ARRANGING HER HAIR SHE WENT OUT INTO THE BROAD PASSAGE AND LISTENED AT HER FATHER'S DOOR
I SAY WHERE'S YOUR SWORD
THE BOY WAS IN CAPITAL SPIRITS AND HE WAS WHISTLING MERRILY HIS SHRILL NOTES ECHOING FROM THE FLAT ROOF AS HE CAME ON SWINGING HIS LANTHORN IN ONE HAND THE BASKET IN THE OTHER
I THOUGHT I'D TRY SAID THE LAD STIFFLY
THEN WHAT A DUMBLE HEAD YOU MUST BE TO THINK WE'LL LET YOU GO
HUMPH SAID THE LIEUTENANT AS RAM WENT BELOW
BUT SMUGGLERS DON'T STAND AT ANYTHING SOMETIMES DICK SIGHED AND THEN ALL AT ONCE HE SPAT IN HIS FIST RUBBED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND CLENCHED THEM A HARD FIERCE ASPECT COMING INTO HIS ROUGH DARK FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PROMISE SEVERE RETALIATION IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO THE YOUNG OFFICER
DO GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK AND DON'T SCOLD ME ANY MORE TILL I'VE GOT ON MY UNIFORM AND HAD A GOOD WASH MY DEAR BOY
AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE AFTER VENTURING UP AND NEARLY HAVING A SEVERE FALL IN THE DARKNESS ESCAPE WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT WAY SO HE RETURNED AFTER EACH TRIAL TO THINK AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF THE PLACE HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIGGING OUT STONE OF WHICH THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY BY WHICH THE GREAT PIECES HAD BEEN DRAGGED UP TO DAYLIGHT
I'LL GO BACK AND TRY SOME OTHER WAY EASY TO DETERMINE BUT HARD TO CARRY OUT IN THE DARKNESS AND IN A PLACE WHICH SEEMED QUITE CHANGED AT NIGHT
IT WAS FOR LIBERTY AND NATURALLY ENOUGH THE MIDSHIPMAN MADE NO SUPERFICIAL SEARCH
HE LEFT HIS TASK WITH RELUCTANCE BUT NATURE WOULD NOT BE REFUSED AND WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE BASKET ATE HEARTILY SAT STILL TO THINK A FEW MINUTES AND THOUGHT TOO MUCH STARTING UP SUDDENLY AND RUBBING HIS EYES
A CARGO OF CONTRABAND GOODS WAS LANDED ON THE ROCKS BELOW THE CLIFF LAST NIGHT AND YOU DON'T SAY SO MASTER SAID SHACKLE EARNESTLY
SEEMS TO ME LIKE GOING EEL-FISHING WITH YOUR BARE HAND WORSE
STRIKES ME THAT HE'LL LIE THERE AND NOT SHOW A LIGHT ON THE CHANCE OF A SMUGGLING LUGGER COMING ALONG THOUGH THAT'S HARDLY OUR LUCK I DON'T KNOW SAID ARCHY BITTERLY
I'VE BEEN SWEEPING THE SHORE AND IT BROUGHT BACK OLD DAYS
HARK YES
AWAY FLEW THE BUCKET AND OVER WENT DICK ON HIS BACK
TWO HOURS WOULD BE PLENTY FOR THE WORK AND AS HE GUESSED IT WAS NOT MUCH PAST TWELVE NOW
NO HE SAID SHORTLY AS HE DREW HIMSELF UP
WHAT'S GOING ON
IT ISN'T RIGHT TO SEND GENTLEMEN AND OFFICERS TO DO SUCH DIRTY WORK
FALL'S ONE THING A DIVE ANOTHER
DRIVEN FROM THAT BY A REGULAR COURSE OF BEATING THE GROUND IT LED ITS PURSUERS UPWARD AMONG ROUGH TUMBLED STONES WHERE THE BRAMBLES TRIPPED THEM AND HERE THEY LOST IT FOR A TIME
OFFICERS COMES FIRST
LIKE SOME BACCO TO CHEW HE SAID
SHE HAD SEEN THE HUGE WAVES COME TUMBLING IN TO SEND COLUMNS OF SPRAY HIGH IN THE AIR TO BE BORNE OVER THE LAND IN A SALT RAIN AND AS A RULE THE SEA REPELLED HER AND SHE SHRANK TOO FROM THE GREAT FOLDS OF THE CLIFF WITH THEIR MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING GRASS-GROWN LEDGES AND CRACKS UP WHICH CAME THE WHISPERING AND GURGLING OF WATER AND AT TIMES FIERCE HISSINGS AS IF SEA MONSTERS LIVED BELOW AND WERE THREATENING THOSE WHO LOOKED DOWN AND DID NOT PAUSE TO THINK THAT THESE SOUNDS MUST BE CAUSED BY AIR COMPRESSED BY THE INRUSHING TIDE
DIDN'T I JEMMY JUMP ASHORE YOU TWO SAID THE LIEUTENANT AND HAVE A GOOD SEARCH ALL AMONG THOSE ROCKS
IF HE COULD BUT GET AWAY AND GIVE THE ALARM
SHE CALLED AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NO CHEERY BARK IN RESPONSE AND WITH HER DESPONDENT FEELING ON THE INCREASE SHE BEGAN TO CLIMB THE SIDE OF THE HOLLOW PASSING UNNOTICED GREAT CLUSTERS OF BLACKBERRIES WHOSE ROOTS WERE FAST IN THE STONES AND THE FRUIT LOOKING LIKE BUNCHES OF BLACK GRAPES
GOOD JOB FOR YOU WAS THE REPLY AS THE SAILS WERE LOWERED AND THE CUTTER LAY CLOSE IN UNDER THE CLIFF WAITING
IT'S A COW A WHAT COW SIR OVERBOARD QUITE RIGHT
FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES HE HAD FELT SOMETHING UNCOMMONLY LIKE ALARM AND HAD DWELT UPON THE CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF IF THE SMUGGLERS FOUND THE SPY UPON THEIR PROCEEDINGS
ARCHY WAS SOME LITTLE DISTANCE AHEAD OF HIS MEN AND HE HAD JUST STEPPED INTO THE PATCH OF WOODLAND WHICH SURROUNDED THE HOZE WHEN HE HEARD A PLEASANT LITTLE VOICE SINGING A SNATCH OF A JACOBITE SONG
MUCH MORE RAM KEPT ASKING AS HE TOILED AWAY WET NOW WITH PERSPIRATION
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE BEEN SHUT UP IN A PLACE LIKE A CELLAR ALWAYS BLACK AND LONGING TO SEE THE BLUE SKY AND SUNSHINE WELL THERE AREN'T NONE NOW MY LAD NO GURR THERE IS NO BLUE SKY AND SUNSHINE BUT--BUT--THIS IS DELIGHTFUL AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH HIS BREAST SWELLING I FEEL STUPID AND AS IF I COULD CRY LIKE A CHILD THEY WERE NEARING THE CUTTER FAST HER LIGHTS GROWING PLAINER AND THE LAD LEANED FORWARD WITH FEELINGS THAT WERE ALMOST ECSTATIC AS HE TRIED TO SCAN HER LINES AND THOUGHT OF LEAPING ON HER DECK AND FEELING THE EASY YIELDING MOTION AS SHE ROSE AND FELL TO HER CABLE WHERE SHE LAY AT ANCHOR
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHITE HAWK'S MORE THAN HALF A MILE AWAY BUT THEN SEE WHAT A FOG IT WAS FATHER TCHAH
OH MY HE OPENED HIS EYES AND BEGAN TO STARE WILDLY
I SHALL NEVER GET MY PROMOTION
AND YOU SHOULD SEE THE MORNING COME OVER OUR COAST SIR
IT'S ALL BECAUSE I'M SO LITTLE AND SO FAT ARCHY WAS SILENT FOR HE KNEW IT WAS THE TRUTH AND THAT SUCH A QUAINT LITTLE FELLOW DID NOT SOMEHOW QUITE COMMAND THE MEN'S RESPECT
THREE TIMES OVER AFTER LISTENING AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS FOR SOUNDS FROM BELOW WHERE HER PRISONER WAS CONFINED CELIA HAD CREPT ON TIPTOE TO HER FATHER'S DOOR ONLY TO SHRINK AWAY AGAIN NOT DARING TO SPEAK
DON'T SPEAK CROSS TO HIM JEMMY
DIRECTLY AFTER THERE WAS THE SOFT GLOW OF A LANTHORN WHICH SUDDENLY CAME INTO VIEW ROUND A CORNER HIGH UP BY THE CEILING AND THE BEARER BEGAN TO DESCEND A ROUGH SLOPE
IT WAS THAT OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN DETAINED WITH THE BOY AND THIS OTHER HE WAS SURE WAS THE VOICE OF THE FARMER
IF MR BROUGH GOES ON DECK AND CATCHES THAT BOY WHISTLING THERE'LL BE SOMEONE TO PAY AND NO PITCH HOT THOUGHT ARCHY NAUTICALLY
ALL WAS STILL
THE MOVEMENT BETRAYED HIM FOR BEFORE HE COULD QUITE REALISE THAT HIS DIRK WAS HIDDEN IN HIS BREAST HE WAS SEIZED BY TWO GREAT MUSCULAR HANDS DRAGGED INTO A STANDING POSITION AND HE COULD DIMLY SEE A FACE PEERING INTO HIS AS A VOICE WHICH HE RECOGNISED AS THE FARMER'S GROWLED SAVAGELY WHO'S THIS BEFORE HE COULD STRUGGLE OR ANSWER THE MAN WENT ON FIERCELY WHY YOU LAZY SHUFFLING YOUNG VILLAIN
WHAT IS IT HELP AND THEN MORE LOUDLY LET ME OUT PRAY OH MOANED THE GIRL WHAT DOES IT MEAN AHOY THERE CAME MORE PLAINLY NOW
I AM ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE OF HIS MAJESTY'S CUTTER WHITE HAWK AND YOU WANT TO SEE MY FATHER CRIED THE GIRL BEGINNING TO TREMBLE
I HAVE HARDLY A BREATH LEFT IN ME BUT WHERE ARE THE MEN MR GURR THE MEN MR RAYSTOKE SIR
YOU HAD A BIT OF A TASTE OF IT THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SURPRISED IN THE LANE
BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE BOAT AND THE MIDSHIPMAN HESITATED ABOUT BELIEVING THAT THE MAN AND BOY COULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF A GOOD WAVE AND RUN HER RIGHT ON
BUT I COULDN'T DO IMPOSSIBILITIES COULD I I AM SURE YOU DID WONDERS MR BROUGH SAID ARCHY
HE STOPPED TO WIPE THE COLD PERSPIRATION AWAY THAT WAS GATHERING ON HIS BROW AND THEN TRYING TO KEEP HIMSELF COOL HE STOOD THINKING AND FINALLY IN UTTER WEARINESS SAT DOWN
VERY ILL-ADVISED THING TO DO
OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT-TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
THE MEN CHEERED AS THE DIRECTION OF THE BOATS HEADS WAS CHANGED
ARCHY MARCHED FORWARD
AFTER ALL THAT WORK AFTER BEING SO SURE TO BE OUT HERE ON THIS WRETCHED SHELF LIKE AN OLD CORMORANT BUT WITHOUT ANY WINGS I DON'T CARE HE SAID ALOUD AFTER AGAIN AND AGAIN CONVINCING HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE MEANS OF FARTHER DESCENT
WHY REPLIED ARCHY
MEANWHILE RAM HAD BEEN BUSY REMOVING THE PIECES OF STONE LAYING BARE A TRAP-DOOR UPON WHICH WERE A BIG WOODEN LOCK AND A COUPLE OF BOLTS
DON'T TRY TO CHOP LOGIC HERE
THE BOATSWAIN GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THEY HAD BEEN GOING WESTWARD BUT HE COULD GIVE NO REASON WHY
WE'VE NO RIGHT TO GO SEARCHING THEIR PLACES MR RAYSTOKE BUT I SHALL MAKE A MISTAKE
A PECULIAR WHISHING OF WINGS FROM FAR OVERHEAD AS A FLOCK OF BIRDS FLEW ON THROUGH THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE WONDERFUL INSTINCT WHICH MADE THEM TAKE FLIGHT TO OTHER LANDS
AND YOU WON'T PUNISH HIM SIR AND YOU'LL KEEP HIM AWAY FROM THE SMUGGLING NEVER FEAR CRIED THE LIEUTENANT LAUGHING
I MEAN ABOUT THE LINCOLNSHIRE COAST
HE HUGGED THE KNEES UPON WHICH HIS CHIN RESTED AND GAZED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM INTO THE BLACKNESS WATCHING FOR THE FIRST GLOW OF RAM'S LANTHORN AND SEEING AS HE WATCHED THE GLORIOUS SKY THE BLUE SEA ALL A-RIPPLE
HE JERKED HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THE LIEUTENANT WAS ABOUT TO GIVE AN ORDER BUT ALTERED HIS MIND FOR HE SUSPECTED THE MAN'S MISSION NOT AN UNUSUAL ONE IN THOSE DAYS
HE HAS BEEN FINE AND MAD ABOUT IT AND I MOST THINK HE'S TURNED A BIT THINNER EH DICK AY THAT HE HAVE SAID THE LATTER
CHAPTER TWENTY SIX
ARCHY CROUCHED THERE BREATHLESS AND LISTENING WONDERING WHO THE MAN COULD BE WHO WAS PERFECTLY SILENT NOW BUT HE HAD NOT MOVED AWAY UNLESS THE TURF HAD SILENCED HIS FOOTPRINTS
NOTHIN BUT GREAT HIGH STONY ROCKS FULL O BEDS OF GREAT FLAT PERIWINKLES AND WHELKS
AND GRIP JOINED IN
I SAY DIRTY DICK ARE YOU SURE THE WATCH WASN'T CALLED TOO SOON NAY SIR NOT A BIT
THE EFFECT WAS MAGICAL
CLIMB OUT AND RUN FOR HELP
THE PICTURE WAS LOVELY IN THE EXTREME BUT IT WANTED TWO THINGS IN ARCHY'S EYES TO MAKE IT PERFECT
ALL AT ONCE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A GLEAM OF LIGHT FOLLOWING A FAINT NOISE AND RIGHT BEFORE HIM HE SAW THE FLUTTERING BLUE FLAME OF A BRIMSTONE MATCH WHICH BLUE BEGAN TO TURN YELLOW AND ILLUMINE THE FACE OF THE BOY WHO HAD BEEN A PRISONER AND TWO GREAT STACKS OF KEGS AND BALES REACHING NEARLY FROM FLOOR TO CEILING OF A LOW VAULT
THERE'S NOWT IN IT AND HE ADDED TO HIMSELF NOT LIKE TO BE AGAIN HE SETTLED HIMSELF INTO HIS PLACE IN AS BUSINESSLIKE A WAY AS A FARM LAD WOULD WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE COW-SHED BUT THE MOMENT HE BEGAN THE COW GAVE HER TAIL A SWING LIFTED HER LEG AND PLANTED IT IN THE BUCKET HOLDING IT DOWN ON THE DECK
I'LL GO FIRST
WHY I COULD FILL A BASKET HERE AND THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING TO MIND I KNOW
I SAY DON'T BE SNARKY WITH ME
HEIGH-HO-HA-HUM
NOTHER INCH CAME UP OUT OF THE VOID
AGAIN TO STOP AT THE END OF A YARD OR TWO FEELING ABOUT WITH ONE FOOT
THE COW TOOK TO HER JOURNEY VERY KINDLY HELPING THE PROGRESS BY SWIMMING TILL THEY WERE ALONGSIDE THE CUTTER WHERE THE MEN ON DECK WERE LOOKING OVER THE LOW SIDE AND GRINNING WITH AMUSEMENT
CHAPTER TWO
BUT I'LL--YES I'LL GIVE YOU A GUINEA IF YOU WILL LET ME OUT GUINEA SAID THE BOY
AND AFTER A CAREFUL INSPECTION HAD SHOWN THAT THE FOOTPRINTS IN THE DEWY GRASS HAD GONE NO FARTHER THAN THE ENTRANCE THE MEN WERE CALLED UP AND STOOD ROUND THE PIT
THERE WAS AN ECHOING SOUND FROM THEIR FOOTSTEPS DULL TO HIM BUT STILL PLAIN AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE DOWN IN SOME NARROW CUTTING OR RIFT WHEN ALL AT ONCE
HE WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME IN THE QUARRY BUT OUT HERE WITH THE MEN ABOUT I'LL MAKE HIM SING A DIFFERENT TUNE WHERE CAN THEY BE HE CRIED AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR QUITE HALF AN HOUR
BEG PARDON SIR BUT YOU SEE I WANTS SOMETHING TO SIT ON
THE SHIMMER AND PLAY OF A PASSING SHOAL OF FISH
NOW MY LADS CUTLASSES HERE
WOULD THERE BE TIME TO GO BACK HE WAS ON THE POINT OF BIDDING THE MEN BOUT SHIP WHEN A FIRM BELIEF IN HIS HAVING BEEN CHEATED CAME OVER HIM AND HE KEPT ON
HERE THEY COME ARCHY STOPPED SHORT AS HE FELT HIS POSITION
LOOK HERE MY MAN SAID ARCHY AS HE LAY WITH HIS HEAD AND CHEST OVER THE EDGE OF THE AWFUL PRECIPICE LISTENING TO THE FAINT BEAT OF THE WAVES AND INVOLUNTARILY THINKING OF HIS ADVENTURE WITH RAM AS SOON AS DICK GRIPS YOU GET TIGHT HOLD OF HIM TOO AY CAME UP IN A HOARSE WHISPER
THIS WAY AND AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME IN RAPID SUCCESSION A COUPLE OF DULL THUDS FROM SEAWARD AND A CHEER FROM THE CREW BEHIND AS LED BY ARCHY RAYSTOKE THE MEN NOW WENT OVER THE UNDULATING CLIFF TOP AT A TROT
I'M GETTING VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT MR RAYSTOKE START AT ONCE SIR NO WAIT ANOTHER HALF-HOUR
I NEVER COULD SEE A BIT O HARM IN DOING WHAT I DO
I'M LIKE POOR OLD GURR
I AREN'T SKIPPER NO MORE NOR YOU ARE ANOTHER PIECE OF INSOLENCE THOUGHT THE PRISONER
SHOW THE LANTHORN JEMMY THE MAN CAME FORWARD AND ARCHY WAS MADE TO FOLLOW HIM THE SMUGGLER AND HIS SON COMING ON BEHIND
BUT DO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF YAH BANG WENT THE DOOR AND MRS SHACKLE AFTER PUTTING A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT WENT OFF OBEDIENTLY TO BED TROUBLING IN NO WISE ABOUT THE DOOR BEING LEFT ON THE LATCH
FATHER WAS RIGHT BUT I DUNNO WHETHER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SEE FROM THE LUGGER
ALL THIS TIME AS IF THE BEARERS WERE COMING VERY LEISURELY THE LIGHT SLOWLY APPROACHED AND AS THE MIDSHIPMAN MORE FULLY GRASPED THE FACT THAT HE MUST BE EITHER IN A STONE QUARRY OR A MINE HE SAW THAT THE LIGHT WAS AN ORDINARY HORN LANTHORN AND FROM THE SHADOWS IT CAST HE COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE ONE OF WHOM WAS CARRYING SOMETHING WEIGHTY ON HIS SHOULDERS
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT FATHER I WAS THINKING HOW ARTFUL REVENUE CUTTERS ARE BOY
BOTHER
BESIDES THERE MUST BE A WAY DOWN FARTHER IF I COULD FIND IT
WHY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THIS TIME THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT WAS SCANNING THE CLIFFS AGAIN AND THE MASTER TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD
GOOD DOG THEN HE SHOUTED AND THERE WAS A FURIOUS BURST OF BARKING
YOU PEOPLE WENT UP THERE ONE DAY AND TOUCHED YOUR HATS TO SIR RISDON AND WERE AFRAID TO GO CLOSE UP TO THE HOUSE WHEN ALL THE TIME THE CELLAR WAS CHOKE FULL I REMEMBER SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN
SUDDENLY A LARGE OBJECT IS SEEN SWIMMING IN THE WATER AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A COW
WHETHER IT WAS NIGHT OR DAY WHEN ARCHY AWOKE HE COULD NOT TELL BUT HE FELT RESTED AND REFRESHED AND READY TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
AND IN SPITE OF ITS FEEBLE POOR DULLED LIGHT THE PRISONER WAS ABLE TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE PLACE THAN HE HAD HAD BEFORE
SHE IS A MISERABLE THING WITHOUT A DROP OF MILK IN HER WHAT CRIED RAM WITH HIS FACE BECOMING ANIMATED
YOU WERE TO GIVE ME MY DIRK MRS SHACKLE OH YES SIR CRIED THE WOMAN CROSSING TO AN OLD BUREAU AND TAKING OUT THE LITTLE WEAPON
THE BOATS WERE DOWN THE MEN ARMED AND THE GUNS LOADED READY IN CASE THE SMUGGLER VESSEL SHOULD ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE
YOU SAW ME AND SPOKE TO ME TO-DAY WHEN THE DOG CAME AT ME THERE WAS A LOW WAILING SOUND WHICH TROUBLED THE MIDSHIPMAN AND HE SAID QUICKLY CAN YOU NOT BELIEVE ME
GET ALL THE GOOD THINGS YOU DO
I'VE BEEN WAITING SUCH A TIME RAM LOOKED SHARPLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING PARTICULAR ON THE WAY BUT HE SAID NOTHING
TELL ME WHAT TO DO--TO GET HELP
BUT PRAY TELL ME SIR WAS ANY ONE HURT NO BUT WE HAVE NO THANKS TO GIVE YOUR PEOPLE
THEN RAM BEGAN TO MUTTER AGAIN
THANK YE!--NO DICK CONTINUED THE MASTER TURNING BACK TO WHERE THE MEN WERE WAITING AND UNCONSCIOUSLY BRUSHING AGAINST THE BUSH BEHIND WHICH THE MIDDY HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF THAT WOMAN KNOWS NOTHING
THERE SAID THE GREAT ROUGH FELLOW AFTER THREE HOURS SAILING
NOW MR GURR HE SAID I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU IN THE WAY OF INSTRUCTIONS YES SIR WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO WAIT TILL I HAVE DONE SPEAKING MR GURR AND NOT COMPEL ME TO SAY ALL I WISH OVER AGAIN BEG PARDON SIR SAID THE MASTER DEPRECATINGLY
GRIP THE DOG HAD SUDDENLY MADE HIS APPEARANCE ABOUT FIFTY YARDS IN FRONT RIGHT AS IT WERE OUT OF THE GRASSY SLOPE TO STAND BARKING LOUDLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE TURNING TAIL AND PLUNGING DOWN AGAIN
AND IF HE'S A FISHERMAN LET HIM BE A FISHERMAN
AND TO THE INTENSE DELIGHT OF BOTH THE HAIL WAS RESPONDED TO
IF ONE COULD GET DOWN HE SAID TO HIMSELF
TO ACHIEVE IT WITHOUT WAS A TERRIBLY RISKY TASK
HE WON'T LET GO
WHAT SHALL I DO POOR LITTLE LASSIE SAID ARCHY TO HIMSELF AS HE SMILED COMPLACENTLY
I AM SURPRISED AT YOU SIR
I'VE GOT SOME NICE LITTLE ROUND MESSENGERS TO SEND IN AFTER YOU HE DREW A PISTOL FROM HIS BELT AND COCKED IT WINKING AT ARCHY AS HE DID SO
TELL YOU WHAT MY LAD I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BRANDY KEGS ARE STILL HERE AND THEN I THINK WE'LL BE OFF AND COME BACK WITH LIGHTS
AND ONCE MORE I WARN YOU THAT IF YOU COME PESTERING ME WITH YOUR PROPOSALS I SHALL KNOCK YOU DOWN WITH A STONE AND THEN ESCAPE NOT YOU REPLIED RAM WITH A QUIET LAUGH
THEN THEY CLASPED AGAIN SWAYED HERE AND THERE ARCHY GETTING FAR THE WORSE OF THE ENCOUNTER FROM WEAKNESS BUT WITH A FINAL CALL UPON HIMSELF HE STROVE DESPERATELY TO RECOVER LOST GROUND AND MADE SO FIERCE AN EFFORT TO THROW RAM IN TURN THAT HE SUCCEEDED
I WANT TO HELP YOU
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE DOING SAID THE LIEUTENANT
FORM YOUR LINE AGAIN
KEEP QUIET AND YOU WON'T BE HURT THE LAD'S HEART BEAT HEAVILY AND HE FELT HOT AND HALF SUFFOCATED
AND THE NEXT MINUTE HIS LEGS WERE SEED AS HE BACKED OUT DRAGGING EVIDENTLY SOME ONE AFTER HIM WHO WAS RESISTING
NOW MY LAD HE SAID TRY AND GIVE US THE SHAPE OF THE PLACE LIKE ARCHY OBEYED AND EXPLAINED WHERE THE SMUGGLERS STORES LAY AND THE PILE OF LITTLE KEGS IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN MOVED THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SLEPT AND THE POSITIONS OF THE HUGE PILLARS AND HEAPS OF BROKEN STONES
WHERE'S THAT MAN HE WHISPERED TO THE FIRST SAILOR HE ENCOUNTERED WHO LIKE THE REST WAS EAGERLY WATCHING SEAWARD
HUNGER IS AN OVERMASTERING DESIRE AND HE CREPT ON STEP BY STEP WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS PICTURING IN THE DARKNESS SLICES OF HAM YELLOW BUTTER BROWN CRUSTED LOAVES AND PURE SWEET MILK TILL AS HE DRAGGED HIS FEET SLOWLY ALONG HALF-FAINTING NOW WITH PAIN WEARINESS AND DESPAIR HIS FOOT SUDDENLY KICKED AGAINST SOMETHING WHICH ROLLED OVER AND OVER AWAY FROM HIM
THE WRETCHES
OH THAT'S IT IS IT CRIED RAM WHO STOOD UPON HIS GUARD BUT DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST BIT ALARMED
OUGHT TO GET THAT STUFF AWAY NO I WOULDN'T MASTER
OH VERY WELL
OH VERY WELL
I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF THIS DREADFUL DARK PLACE
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE WON'T YOU HAVE THE JEW'S HARP IF I GO AND FIND IT NO NOR YET THE FIDDLE IF I BORROW IT NO I SAY DON'T BE SO SNARKY WITH ME
THEY DARE NOT STARVE ME
TOUCH YOUR CAP AND ASK THE LIEUTENANT TO LET YOU WHY I HAVE TOUCHED IT TWICE
AND YOU MY MEN NEVER MIND YOUR OARS THE OTHERS'LL PICK THEM UP
I CAN SEE YOU PLAINLY THERE BY THE WINDOW
CUTLASHES THERE WAS A RUSH
AND AT LAST THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ABREAST OF THE OPENING INTO THE COVE WHERE THEY LAY UPON THEIR OARS FOR A TIME LISTENING
NO NO GRIP
BY THIS TIME THERE WAS A STRANGE SINGING IN HIS EARS A FEELING AS IF THE BLOOD WAS FLOODING HIS EYES A PECULIAR HOT SUFFOCATING FEELING IN HIS BREAST AND THEN HE SEEMED TO GO OFF INTO A PAINFUL FEVERISH SLEEP FOR HE KNEW NO MORE
NOW THEN TELL EM TO SHOVE THE STONES SHARP AND LET EM FALL OUT
WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK SIR WHAT AM I TO SAY
BUT ON THE FOURTH DAY THERE WAS SO MEAN AND UNSATISFACTORY A DINNER AT THE HOZE OF THE PALTRY LITTLE ROCK FISH CAUGHT BY THE LABOURING MEN THAT AS CELIA WATCHED HER MOTHER PARTAKING OF THE UNSATISFACTORY FARE AND THOUGHT HOW EASILY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED BY A DISH OF MUSHROOMS AND A BLACKBERRY PUDDING SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT THE NEXT DAY SHE WOULD GO
AND IF IT HAPPENS THAT THEY ARE NOT SMUGGLERS AND THERE'S TROUBLE ABOUT IT YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY ARCHY HEARD ALL THIS AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE PARTY WERE ABOUT TO PASS HIM WHEN A VOICE HE WELL KNEW GROWLED OUT HIT ME AN AWFUL WHACK WITH A STICK AY I GOT ONE TOO MY LAD
IT WAS A TERRIBLE POSITION
LET'S FIND THE WAY IN AND THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
AS THE LIGHT CAME ON THE MIDSHIPMAN MADE OUT THAT QUITE A STORE OF SPARS ROPES AND BLOCKS LAY AT A SHORT DISTANCE AND THAT MORE DIMLY SEEN WAS A LARGE STACK OF TUBS FROM WHICH DOUBTLESS EMANATED THE ODOUR OF BRANDY
WHAT IS IT WANT TO SEE THE SKIPPER THERE WAS A LITTLE BUSTLE FORWARD IN THE MIDST OF WHICH A BOAT CAME UP ALONGSIDE AND THE MAN IN IT WAS ALLOWED TO COME ON BOARD
CELIA SELDOM WENT SEAWARD
MUST BE A WAY UP HE SAID EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING THAT THERE MUST BE BECAUSE HE WANTED IT AND HE TOOK TIGHTLY HOLD OF A ROUGH CORNER AND LEANED OUT A LITTLE TO GAZE UPWARD TO FIND IN WHICHEVER DIRECTION HE LOOKED RIGHT OR LEFT THERE WAS NOTHING BUT RUGGED LIMESTONE WHICH HAD BEEN SPLINTERED AND MOULDED BY TIME TILL THERE WAS NOT A SPOT WHERE THE MOST VENTURESOME CLIMBER COULD OBTAIN FOOTHOLD
ALL WORE OUT NOTHING ELSE NO SIR YOU GO AND LOOK THE SECOND MAN DISAPPEARED BUT RETURNED DIRECTLY
I OWE HIM SUCH A THRASHING THAT I MUST HAVE A TURN AT HIM AH THAT'S DIFFERENT SAID THE LIEUTENANT
I'VE QUITE OUT-RUN THEM HE SAID HALF ALOUD AS HE PEERED ROUND THROUGH THE GLOOM LISTENING INTENTLY THE WHILE BUT NOT A SOUND COULD BE HEARD AND IN HIS ANGRY IMPATIENCE HE STAMPED HIS FOOT UPON THE SHORT DRY GRASS
THE GREAT WREATHS OF MIST YIELDED RAPIDLY AS THE SUN ROSE HIGHER THE RAYS SHOOTING THROUGH AND THROUGH MAKING CLEAR ROADS WHICH FLASHED WITH LIGHT AND AS THE CLOUDS ROLLED AWAY LIKE THE GREY SMOKE OF THE SUN'S FIRE THE DISTANT CLIFFS WHICH TOWERED UP STEEP AND STRAIGHT LIKE SOME TITANIC WALL CAME PEERING OUT NOW IN PATCHES BRIGHT WITH GREEN AND GOLDEN GREY
AND KNOWING TOO THAT IT WOULD BREAK YOUR FATHER'S AND MOTHER'S HEART I DID NOT WRITE AND TELL THEM
WELL I DO CALL THAT GRUMPY
WASHED UP EH
DON'T BE AFRAID OF HIM RAM
CAN'T SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO HELD ONE OF DICK'S LEGS
THERE WAS A MIST BEFORE HIS EYES AND HE INVOLUNTARILY PRESSED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE ROCK EXPECTING TO FALL AND IN A CURIOUS DREAMY WAY HE SAW HIMSELF HANGING FAR BELOW SWINGING AT THE END OF THE ROPE
WELL HE EXCLAIMED
AND YOU MUST TOUCH YOUR CAP THAT WAY SAID RAM
AND SOON AFTER THEY WERE PASSING IN THE LOWEST OF LOW SPIRITS OUT OF THE COVE TO THE OPEN CHANNEL WHEN ONCE MORE EVERY ONE WAS THRILLED WITH EXCITEMENT FOR RIGHT AWAY IN THE OFFING THEY HEARD A GUN
HERE TAKE THE TILLER MR RAYSTOKE AND HE SHIFTED HIS POSITION PASSED THE TILLER TO ARCHY AND STOOD UP AND DREW HIS SWORD
WHY A RABBIT COULDN'T AND I'VE SEEN THEM DO SOME RUM THINGS CUTTING UP THE ROCKS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN STRAIGHT UP LIKE A WALL
NOT BREAD AND WATER BUT GOOD TASTY PROVISIONS AND--"WHAT'S THIS IN THE BOTTLE HE ASKED HIMSELF AS HE REMOVED THE CORK
AND GAVE HIM A SMART SLAP ON THE SHOULDER AS HE WAS GOING AFTER THE COW
I THINK O THEM AS WAS BEFORE ME
ARCHY HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE THE PAIR HALTED BY THE STACK OF KEGS TO WHICH THE FOUR CARRIED BY THE MAN WERE ADDED AND THIS DONE THEY TURNED AND CAME TOWARD HIM
ADVANCING CAUTIOUSLY HE ENTERED THE GARDEN AND WAS JUST GOING UP TO THE WINDOW WHEN THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND HE DROPPED DOWN BEHIND A BUSH AS THE FARMER STRODE OUT
JEMMY DADD WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF FARMER SHACKLE ONE WHO ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF DOING AS LITTLE AS WAS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE FARM
IT FELT MORE LIKE A BLOW BUT PEOPLE KEPT TRAMPLING ON ME AFTER I WAS DOWN THAT'S BAD SAID GURR GIVING VENT TO A LOW WHISTLE
BUT THE COLD GREY MIST THAT HUNG AROUND WAS BECOMING HERE AND THERE IN PATCHES SHOT WITH A SOFT DELICIOUS ROSY HUE WHICH MADE THE GREY AROUND TURN OPALESCENT RAPIDLY BEGINNING TO FLASH OUT PALE YELLOW WHICH AS THE MIDDY WATCHED DEEPENED INTO ORANGE AND GOLD
HE IS IN A WAX SAID DICK TO HIMSELF AS HE WALKED TO THE SIDE AND STOOD SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS LOOKING CAREFULLY FOR THE SIGNALS WHICH DID NOT COME
BUT THEY SHALL SMART FOR ALL THIS
YOU'D SOONER KEEP ME HERE TO ROT IN THE DARKNESS NO I WOULDN'T AND I'D LET YOU OUT IF I COULD CRIED RAM WITH ANIMATION
RAM HE CRIED AT LAST
I HARDLY KNOWED YOU NONSENSE
AND FELL TO LIE INSENSIBLE FOR A TIME
SPEAK OUT AND DON'T DO THE DOUBLE SHUFFLE ALL OVER MY CLEAN DECK NO SIR HOPPING ABOUT LIKE A CAT ON HOT BRICKS
SHE HAD THEN HER SPEECH ALL READY BUT WHEN SHE SPOKE EVERYTHING WAS CONDENSED IN THE ONE EXCLAMATION OH FOR AS SHE REACHED THE HALL WHERE HER COMING AND GOING HAD SO STARTLED THE MIDSHIPMAN IN THE DARKNESS SHE FOUND THAT THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN AND THE WINDOW SHUT
HE WON'T LET YOU GO HOW LONG IS HE GOING TO KEEP ME HERE DON'T KNOW
IS THAT YOU RAM ARCHY TRIED TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT
HERE HE CRIED IN AN ANGRY WHISPER WHO WAS AT THE HELM I YOUR HONOUR SAID A VOICE
CHAPTER THIRTY NINE
WHICH WAY IS IT
IT ALL COMES OF BEING APPOINTED TO A WRETCHED LITTLE COBBLE BOAT LIKE THIS AND SENT ON SMUGGLING DUTY
YOU MUST STOP HERE AS LONG AS FATHER LIKES BUT WHY SHOULDN'T YOU AND ME BE FRIENDS
GOING UP THERE YES OF COURSE SAID ARCHY SHORTLY
IN DUE TIME THEY REACHED THE ENTRANCE TO THE QUARRY AND FOUND THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS THEY HAD ANTICIPATED THE SMUGGLERS HAVING PILED QUITE A TON OF STONES OVER THE TRAP-DOOR
DO YOU WANT TO SAIL RIGHT OR WRONG NOW OH RIGHT SIR PLEASE THEN TELL ME HONESTLY WHERE THERE ARE ANY MORE GOODS STORED EVERYTHING LEFT SIR WAS PUT IN THE OLD QUARRY NOTHING UP AT THAT HOUSE ON THE HILL NO SIR I THINK NOT
THEN NO BOAT HAD COME FROM THE CUTTER LAST NIGHT AND THE LIEUTENANT WOULD WAIT FOR HIM TO SIGNAL AND HERE HE WAS A PRISONER WITH THE INFORMATION--LOCKED UP--THE VERY NEWS THE LIEUTENANT WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO KNOW
AHOY CAME AGAIN AS IF FROM A DISTANCE AND A THRILL RAN THROUGH THE GIRL BRINGING WITH IT A GLOW OF COURAGE
WHAT CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN EAGERLY
SOON THERE CAME A FAINT CRUNCHING NOISE AS OF A FENDER BEING CRUSHED AGAINST THE ROCK FOLLOWED BY THE SOUND OF ROPES DRAWN OVER THE BULWARK AND RAM HESITATED NO LONGER BUT RAN TO THE LOOP PLACED HIS LEG THROUGH IT GAVE THE SIGNAL BY SHAKING THE ROPE AND IN AN INSTANT HE WAS SNATCHED FROM HIS FEET RUN UP THE ROPE DRAWN IN AND HE WAS LANDED ON THE TURF
HE WOULD NOT DO SO WICKED A THING BUT HE IS A SMUGGLER IT IS NOT TRUE CRIED CELIA PASSIONATELY
HAD TOO MANY OATS AND YOU'RE BEGINNING TO KICK UP YOUR HEELS AND SQUEAK AND SNORT
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY SIR IF I WERE TO ORDER MY MEN IN THE KING'S NAME TO SEARCH YOUR PLACE SIR RISDON DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK BUT DARTED AN AGONISED GLANCE AT HIS WIFE
AH THERE YOU ARE MR RAYSTOKE SAID THE CAPTAIN HANDING THE LIEUTENANT HIS GLASS
OH IT'S GLORIOUS REPLIED THE LAD IN A LOW VOICE
SOME OF THE MEN WILL HEAR BUT THE MEN DID NOT HEAR FOR THEY WERE QUIETLY TRUDGING ALONG OVER THE SHORT GRASS CHEWING THEIR QUIDS AND DISCUSSING THE FIRE IN THE CAVE
BUT LOOK YONDER SIR
AND SO AFTER ENDLESS DISAPPOINTMENTS REGARDING BETTER THINGS HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE LITTLE WHITE HAWK AND SENT TO CRUISE OFF THE SOUTH COAST AND ABOUT THE CHANNEL TO CATCH THE SMUGGLERS WHO WERE ALWAYS TOO CLEVER TO BE CAUGHT
RATS THE DOG BOUNDED UP TO THE BOY ROSE ON HIS HIND LEGS AND PLACED HIS FOREPAWS ON THE LAD'S CHEST BARKING LOUDLY
NOT ESCAPE I MEANT COULDN'T KNOCK ME DOWN WITH A STONE AND PRAY WHY CAUSE I TELL YOU AGEN YOU COULDN'T BE SUCH A COWARD
BO'S'N IT'S A BIG PLACE AND I SHALL WANT ALL MY MEN
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME GO BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T AND I WON'T LET YOU GO BECAUSE I CAN'T THEN GET OUT OF THIS PLACE AND LET ME BE SHAN'T
MUTUAL INQUIRIES TOOK PLACE
HI BO'S'N DOWN WITH THAT TRAP AND MAKE IT FAST
THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S MADE QUITE A MISTAKE SAID MRS SHACKLE DEMURELY
AND THERE'S PLENTY O TIME BUT AFTER A BIT I'D SARVE OUT PISTOLS AND CUTLASSES TO THE LADS
WHAT DID THEY SAY?--FALSE ALARM--TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO-NIGHT--SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT--LOBSTER-BOAT
HALLO
HALLO
NOBODY CAN THINK WELL WHEN HE'S TIRED HE SAID
BUT WILL YOU DO IT IF YOU'LL LET ME SIR LET YOU
IT MUST HAVE BEEN JEMMY DADD
COME ON
DO YOU HEAR ME CRIED ARCHY
AND AS THEY ROWED THEY SAW THE LIEUTENANT AND THE MIDSHIPMAN ENTER THE LIGHT GIG FOUR MEN DROPPED THEIR OARS IN THE WATER AND WITH THE DROPS FLASHING FROM THE BLADES THE GIG CAME SWIFTLY AFTER THEM
WHY YOU COULD BUY YOURSELF A WATCH AND CHAIN AND BE DOING YOUR DUTY TO THE KING AS WELL
SAY YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING OF A BOY OF MINE IN YOUR TRAVELS
HA HA HA LAUGHED RAM SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH
IF HE WISHED TO GET DOWN TO WHERE THE BOY LAY APPARENTLY ABOUT TO SLIP OFF INTO THE SEA THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY AND THAT WAS TO JUMP
HE HAD NOT ENJOYED HIS BREAKFAST AND IT WAS GETTING ON TOWARD THE TIME FOR HIS MID-DAY MEAL
HE HAD MADE NO PLANS FOR THAT
I KNOW THEM
IF HE DID THE WOMAN WAS CERTAIN TO RAISE AN ALARM
PULL OFF TO THE WEST'ARD SHARP AND CUT OFF THAT BOAT IF SHE MAKES FOR THAT WAY
I'M READY LOOK SHARP BOY SAID THE FARMER
THEY'RE SMUGGLERS AND AS ARTFUL AS CAN BE NAY SIR BAD I MEAN--YOU KNOW SIR NO I DON'T DICK CRIED THE YOUNG OFFICER PETTISHLY
I MUST WOMAN
I KNEW THAT RASCAL SUSPECTED US SAY ME BLENHEIM RETORTED MRS SHACKLE
AND WE SHOULD HAVE TOOK OUR SHARE LADS SAID DICK IN A WHISPER
HERE BOY CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
HE SHRANK BACK AS HE RECALLED HOW IT HAD AFFECTED HIM
YONDER AMONG THE TREES
NOT MUCH TO BURN SAID THE LIEUTENANT
THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR-ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION,--SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
THERE UPON MY HONOUR WE'LL PAY YOU IF WE TAKE THE BOAT OH YOU'LL TAKE HER FAST ENOUGH SAID THE MAN WITH A HOARSE CHUCKLE
JEMMY STOPPED UP ON THAT PATCH WHERE YOU AND ME WRASTLED AND LET ME DOWN WITH A ROPE
THE END SAID THE UNHAPPY MAN AS HE LOOKED WILDLY AT HIS WIFE
PULL MY LADS PULL AND YOU'LL HAVE THEM BEFORE THEY LAND CRIED THE MASTER STAMPING HIS FOOT
BUT THIS FRESH EXPLOSION--ONE OF WHICH HE KNEW SCORES MUST NOW RAPIDLY FOLLOW--CHECKED HIM FOR THE MOMENT AND HE SAW THAT RAM HAD DISAPPEARED
WAIT HERE THEN WELL I SHOULD IF I WANTED TO TAKE HER SAID THE MAN COLDLY
AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS FORGOTTEN BUT HE NEVER THOROUGHLY LOST HEART AND DURING THIS TIME HE HAD ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO THE DARKNESS AND EDUCATED HIS FEET WONDERFULLY IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PLACE
HE CAN GET DOWN
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CONTINUED THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN RAISING THE FLAP OF ONE OF HIS SALT-BOX POCKETS
ARCHY SAW NO MORE FOR HE DROPPED DOWN AND HID BEHIND A STONE WATCHING THE GLARE OF LIGHT AND THEN AS IT PASSED HIM GOING ON TOWARD THE OTHER END OF THE CAVE HE CREPT FROM BEHIND THE STONE AND MADE FOR THE ROUGH SLOPE WHICH WAS THOROUGHLY PRINTED ON HIS MIND SO THAT HE COULD ALMOST PICTURE EVERY ROCK AND INEQUALITY THAT MIGHT BE IN HIS WAY
I'LL OVERHAUL HER
HAVE YOU SEEN ONE NOT I
HA HA HA HE LAUGHED AS HE MADE A DERISIVE GESTURE TOWARDS THE CUTTER
I SAY HE SAID
NOW THEN ROARED ARCHY COME ON HURRAH CRIED THE MEN WILDLY
THERE CAME A SMOTHERED ROAR LIKE THAT OF AN ANGRY BEAST
WHY THERE WAS A BIG SHIP'S BOAT AND A JIB-BOOM WASHED UP HERE ONE DAY
GOT EM ALL RIGHT BOY YES FATHER SAID RAM HANDING THE KEY
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THAT AND IT'S A VERY STRANGE THING IF I CAN'T PROVE MYSELF AS CLEVER AS THAT CUNNING YOUNG SCOUNDREL WHO TRAPPED ME HERE
BANG
CELIA GRAEME TOOK SUNDRY PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID BEING SEEN BUT SHE WAS NOT SO SUCCESSFUL AS SHE IMAGINED
YOU FRIGHTENED ME THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE
WORSE LADS THAN YOU IF YOU KNEW WHERE TO FIND EM THANK YE FATHER I'M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST SHALL I COME TOO FATHER NO
WHAT DO YOU THINK I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE SIGNALS WELL MY LAD IF THEY BE IT'S TO BRING THE SMUGGLERS ASHORE WHERE WE MAY HAVE THE LUCK TO BE IN WAITING FOR EM
CHAPTER FORTY
WHAT DID HE SAY GROWLED JEMMY
WHERE'S T'OTHER BASKET A SHIVER RAN THROUGH THE PRISONER AS HE RECOLLECTED THAT WHICH HE HAD FORGOTTEN IN HIS EXCITEMENT
BY DEGREES HE GREW CONSCIOUS OF A FRESH PAIN ONE THAT WAS CERTAINLY NOT PRODUCED BY HIS LATE STRUGGLES OR BY STIFFNESS FROM LYING UPON AN OLD SAIL STRETCHED UPON THE DAMP FLOOR OF A VAULT
I'M GOING TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYTHING NOW
RAM SPRANG UP FOUND A RESTING-PLACE FOR HIS TOES AND LOOKED IN GRINNING AT HIM
IT TOOK HIM JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AND WHEN HE HAD DONE ALL THIS HE COULD FIND NO TRACES OF HIS FOOD BUT HE HEARD A NOISE CLOSE BEHIND HIM WHICH NAILED HIM TO THE SPOT AND HE STOOD MOTIONLESS LISTENING
IN FACT IF THE LAST SPEAKER HAD TAKEN A STEP FORWARD HE MUST HAVE DETECTED THE SPY'S PRESENCE
IF WE CAN SURPRISE THEM BY NIGHT WHEN THEY THINK ALL IS SAFE IT MAY SAVE BLOODSHED
HE TRIED TO BUT HE DARED NOT LOOK OVER WHEN THE ROPE BEGAN TO QUIVER AGAIN
THEN A DISCOVERY WAS MADE AND BY THE MIDSHIPMAN
HE MUST BE IN THE VAULT BENEATH SIR RISDON'S HOUSE AND THOUGH HE HAD NOT NOTICED IT THE FLOOR MUST BE PAVED WITH A LAYER OF STONES SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND WHERE THE LITTLE KEGS HAD BEEN LEFT
ABOUT HALF THE CARGO WAS LANDED WHEN SHACKLE WHISPERED AN ORDER TO RAM WHO AT ONCE STOOPED TO PICK UP A KEG
HERE CRIED ARCHY
CURIOUS GRATITUDE THIS SEEMED FOR SAVING THE LAD'S LIFE
DO YOU REMEMBER COMING UP AND BRINGING A BASKET ABOUT A MONTH AGO YES MISS I R'MEMBER
NO SIR AND MR GURR'S STOPPING AT ONE OF THE FISHERMEN'S COTTAGES ASHORE TO KEEP ON THE SEARCH TUT TUT EJACULATED THE LIEUTENANT AS HE TURNED AWAY AND BEGAN TO PACE THE DECK
BEST RUN WE'VE HAD HE BURST INTO A LOW FIT OF CHUCKLING
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE NEXT LET'S GET RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THIS PLACE AND HAIL THAT'S GOOD ADVICE MR RAYSTOKE SIR
WE WOULD BE WATCHED OF COURSE AND THE SCOUNDRELS WOULD SIGNAL FROM HILL TO HILL AND OUR EVERY STEP WOULD BE KNOWN
NOT FAR BUT HOW FOOLISH OF YOU
I'M SURE IF OUR LIEUTENANT KNEW HE WOULD NOT WISH IT FOR A MOMENT THE BARONET GAZED AT THE BOY WILDLY AS HE CLASPED HIS CHILD TO HIS BREAST
LEAVE ME A LIGHT WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH A LIGHT
WE MUST TAKE CARE THEY DO NOT SEE US NOT LIKELY ON A DARK NIGHT LIKE THIS
AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME HOW I AM NO
TAKE CARE HOW YOU GO
GO AND SPEAK TO HIM
BUT WE MUST SEARCH OH VERY WELL THEN SAID MRS SHACKLE
WE NEVER DID NOTHING TO YOU YOU SCOUNDREL CRIED ARCHY HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT
LOOK AT THE CUTTER SHAN'T
THEN WHY DON'T YOU LEAD ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHUT AND FASTENED THE TRAP AND HEAPED ABOUT A TON OF STONE UPON IT WELL THEN WE MUST HACK THROUGH THE DOOR WITH OUR CUTLASHES AND LET THE STONE DOWN WHAT'S THAT CRIED ARCHY EXCITEDLY,--"A LIGHT FOR THERE WAS A DULL REPORT AND A FLASH OF BLUE LIKE LIGHTNING
IT WAS RATHER RISKY FOR HE WAS ON A NARROW SLIPPERY PLACE AT ONE OF THE TURNS OF THE ZIGZAG AND NEARLY LOST HIS FOOTING BUT DARTING OUT A HAND HE CAUGHT AT THE ROCK RECOVERED HIMSELF AND CLIMBED ON TO REACH THE TOP JUST IN TIME TO SEE RAM'S RED CAP DISAPPEARING SOME FOUR HUNDRED YARDS AWAY OVER A ROUNDED EMINENCE DUE WEST OF WHERE HE STOOD
NEVER MIND TEAR UP YER HANKYCHY AND WRAP ROUND
REMEMBER OUR TUSSLE THERE TO BE SURE I DO SAID LIEUTENANT RAYSTOKE SHELTERING HIS EYES IN A VERY DECEPTIVE FASHION FOR HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE OUT THE OLD GROVE OF TREES AMIDST WHICH STOOD THE HOZE
NOW MR RAYSTOKE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY ONLY TO DELIVER MY MESSAGE
IT WILL BE BEST FOR YOU--AND FOR YOUR SON THEY ONLY STORED CARGOES UP AT SIR RISDON'S BECAUSE IT WAS HANDY SIR AND THEN TOOK THEM ON AFTERWARDS TO THE BIG STORE IN THE OLD QUARRY THAT WAS BURNED LAST NIGHT
HIS MIND BEGAN TO GO A LITTLE MORE AND HE HAD TO TURN BACK MENTALLY
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE--A PUP THIS WAS UTTERED WITH WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE A MOST CONTEMPTUOUS INTONATION OF THE VOICE
GRIP WAS FRANTIC WITH DELIGHT HIS TAIL STOOD STRAIGHT OUT AND HIS EARS LITERALLY RATTLED AS HE CHARGED OVER THE SHORT TURF AFTER SOME RABBIT WHICH DODGED THROUGH THE BUSHES REACHED ITS HOLE DISPLAYED A SCRAP OF WHITE COTTON AND DISAPPEARED
CAN'T EXPECT A MAN TO WORK NIGHT AND DAY TOO HE GRUNTED
AND DID YOU FIND IT YES
HE WAS NOT SURPRISED FOR SOMEHOW MR BROUGH WAS NOT THERE AND GURR HAD ASSUMED THE COMMAND OF THE CUTTER AND WAS PLAYING THE PART OF SMUGGLER AND PIRATE AND INSULTING HIM WHOM HE ADDRESSED AGAIN
I SHOULD LIKE TO KETCH HIM ASHORE SOME DAY ONE OF ARCHY'S LEGS GAVE A TWITCH AT THE FIRST REMARK ABOUT HIM AND THE TWITCH OCCURRED IN HIS RIGHT ARM AT THE SECOND
EVERY ONE OF THE COTTAGES BEING TRIED THE MEN WERE MARCHED DOWN HILL AFTER ARCHY AND STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS GAZING OUT OVER THE CLIFF TO WHERE THE CUTTER LAY AT ANCHOR WITH THE FARMER'S BOAT TRAILING OUT ASTERN AND THE AIR SO CLEAR THAT HE COULD EVEN SEE THE COW TETHERED TO A BELAYING PIN JUST IN FRONT OF THE MAST
FOR ANSWER THE MIDSHIPMAN HELD ON MORE TIGHTLY
SHE HAD SECURED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BELOW TO GAIN TIME FEELING AS SHE DID THAT AS THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN KNEW OF THE STORING OF THE SMUGGLED GOODS HE WOULD THE MOMENT HE WAS FREE GO BACK TO THE CUTTER BRING HELP THERE WOULD PERHAPS BE A DESPERATE FIGHT WITH MEN KILLED AND HER FATHER WOULD BE DRAGGED AWAY TO PRISON
YOU'LL GIVE IT TO ME TO GIVE TO HIM AND WHERE IS HE NEVER YOU MIND MASTER OH WELL THERE THEN
OH IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
SOON THE INQUISITIVE MIDSHIPMAN IS TAKEN PRISONER AND IT FALLS TO ANOTHER TEENAGER THE SON OF ONE OF THE CHIEF ROGUES TO BRING HIM FOOD
HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY HIT UPON THE PLACE WHERE THE CARGO HAD BEEN HIDDEN AND IT MUST BE IN THE CELLAR OF THE HOZE AND NOT IN THE WOOD
LOOK YE HERE JEMMY SAID ONE OF THE MEN TO HIS NEAREST MATE TALK ABOUT TACKING THE ENEMY IF WRONG'S HAPPENED TO OUR YOUNG GENTLEMAN ALL I CAN SAY IS AS I HOPES IT'S ORDERS TO LAND EVERY NIGHT TO BURN WILLAGES AND SACK EVERYTHING WE CAN AND SO SAYS ALL OF US CAME IN A CHORUS FROM THE REST OF THE CREW
SAID IT WAS A DANGEROUS THING FOR A BOY RAM GAVE HIS PRISONER A NOD AND WENT OFF WHISTLING THE PRISONER FOLLOWING AT A DISTANCE AND GETTING PRETTY CLOSE UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SLOPE AS THE LANTHORN DISAPPEARED ROUND A CORNER
BUT HE SAID NOTHING ONLY HURRIED TO KEEP PACE WITH HIS FATHER
DON'T GO ANIGH HER SIR NONSENSE SAID THE LIEUTENANT GOING UP TO THE COW PATTING HER AND HANDLING HER EARS AND HORNS
HE WAS NOW ON A REGULAR SEA-BIRDS SANCTUARY FOR THE ROCK BELOW HIM WAS NOT PERPENDICULAR
THE WRITER HAS GONE THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES MORE THAN ONCE AND FULLY REALISED THE PECULIAR SENSATION OF HELPLESSNESS CONFUSION AND BRAIN NUMBING WHICH FOLLOWS
I'LL BRING YOU SOME DON'T REPLIED ARCHY COLDLY
I COULD BE VERY CAREFUL AND NOT GO NEAR ANY OF THE SLOPES RUNNING DOWN TO THE CLIFF AND I COULD MAKE GRIP KEEP WITH ME
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE
AND WHEN SHE DID COME TO HER SENSES IT WAS TO FIND GRIP LYING BY HER WITH HIS HEAD UPON HER CHEST AND HIS EYES LOOKING INQUIRINGLY INTO HERS AS IF TO ASK WHAT IT ALL MEANT
GRASS IS SO SHORT AND SLITHERY THAT FORE YOU KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE YOUR FEET GOES FROM UNDER YOU AND YOU CAN'T STOP YOURSELF AND OVER YOU GOES
HE WAS WATCHING BY THE ENTRANCE AND JUST AS THE MEN GOT UP AND WOULD HAVE FOUND IT HE JUMPED UP AND DODGED ABOUT LETTING THE MEN NEARLY CATCH HIM AND THEN RUNNING AWAY AND LEADING THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER ON NEVER MIND
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER MY OLD MOTHER WAS DOWN ON THE CLIFF YONDER LOOKING AFTER THE COWS THE COWS CRIED THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT
I SAY FATHER'S GONE AND I DESSAY HE WON'T COME BACK FOR EVER SO LONG AND I DON'T WANT TO GO AMONG THE DUTCHMEN
WHERE DID HE COME FROM SAID THE LIEUTENANT
IT LOOKED MORE PERILOUS TOO THAN IT HAD SEEMED BEFORE BUT THE LAD WAS IN NOWISE DAUNTED
AREN'T YOU
I'LL HAVE SOME FOR BREAKFAST DIDN'T SAY AS I COULD MILK SIR SAID DICK
STRICT SILENCE MY LADS AND THE MOMENT YOU GET THE WORD OVER INTO YOUR BOATS AND LAY READY
THE LIGHT INCREASED RAPIDLY NOW AND THE SOFT GREY SKY GAVE PROMISE OF A GLORIOUS DAY BUT THIS DID NOT TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THOSE ON BOARD THE BOATS WHO COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE LUGGER TRYING TO ESCAPE AND GRADUALLY GROWING MORE DISTANT WHILE THE CUTTER KEPT ON SLOWLY SENDING A SHOT IN HER WAKE EVIDENTLY IN THE HOPE OF BRINGING DOWN ONE OF HER MASTS
WHAT SHALL I DO HELP--PRAY HELP CAME FROM BELOW
THE RESULT OF MY WEAKNESS
CARTS ARE COMING AND ALL THE LADS ARE DOWN THE ROADS ALL NO
NO NO HE CRIED DON'T RUN AWAY SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED FROM HIS FACE TO HIS DIRK AND BACK
I MAY JUST AS WELL BE MOVING HE SAID AT LAST DESPONDENTLY
BROUGHT YOU SOME BACON AND SOME FRIED EGGS THIS TIME SAID RAM LOOKING AT HIM ATTENTIVELY BUT ARCHY MADE NO REPLY
BUT I SAY LOOK HERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEARN TO PLAY THE FIDDLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR CHATTERING TONGUE SOMEWHERE ELSE CAUSE CONTINUED RAM WITHOUT HEEDING THE MIDSHIPMAN'S PETULANT WORDS I COULD BORROW BIG TOM DUNLEY'S OLD FIDDLE
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE COME DOWN NO NO ANOTHER
ALL RIGHT THEY HEARD GURR SAY
A KING'S OFFICER TOO
IF I--IF WE HAD BEEN ABOARD A FRIGATE OR EVEN A SLOOP-OF-WAR WE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD SUCH AN AFFAIR AS THIS
I'VE FELT LIKE THAT BEFORE HE SAID
NOW MY LADS IN WITH YOU CRIED A FAMILIAR VOICE
IT WAS SOON AFTER DAYBREAK THE SEA WAS PERFECTLY CALM AND A THICK GREY MIST HUNG AROUND MAKING THE DECK AND CORDAGE WET AND THE AIR CHILLY WHILE THE COAST WITH ITS VAST WALLS OF PERPENDICULAR ROCKS LOOKED WEIRD AND DISTANT WHERE A PEEP COULD BE OBTAINED AMONGST THE WREATHS OF VAPOUR
I WAS HALF OFF WASN'T I WITH MY LEGS DOWN YES
AS HE LISTENED HE WONDERED WHAT BOAT'S CREW IT COULD BE THAT HAD LANDED AS NO ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE FOR ANY HELP TO BE SENT TILL HE EITHER SIGNALLED FROM THE CLIFF OR WENT DOWN TO THE COVE AT TWELVE THE NEXT DAY WHERE A BOAT WOULD BE ABOUT HALF A MILE OUT WITH TWO MEN IN HER FISHING
WHY SHE'S GOT A LOT OF MEN IN HER CRIED GURR EXCITEDLY
FOR A FEW MOMENTS IT SEEMED ALL OVER
THEN HE'S TO COME HERE WHEN HE LIKES AND SHOW EVERYBODY THE WAY INTO OUR STORE IS HE
THEN FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE SEEN DIRECTLY IF A LANTHORN WERE BROUGHT INTO THE PASSAGE HE PRESSED THE LOCK IT YIELDED AND HE STEPPED SOFTLY UP ON TO A STONE FLOOR
BUT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE SKIPPER THAT WE HAVE GOT SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF A PRIZE FOR THE MEN
A CARGO HAS BEEN RUN HERE ON THIS LEDGE
WHILE AFTER HANDING DOWN THE LANTHORN INTO THE BLACK WELL-LIKE HOLE JEMMY CLIMBED UP AGAIN TO THE SURFACE AND STOOD WITH HIS EYES JUST ABOVE THE LEVEL SHELTERED BY BLACKBERRY STRANDS AND OTHER GROWTH AND SLOWLY MADE HIS EYES REVOLVE
AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE HAD BEEN JOINED IN THE HUNT FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THAT HE FELT THAT THE MEN OUGHT INSTANTLY TO HAVE BEEN STOPPED AND THE PLACE AROUND THOROUGHLY SEARCHED
SAID I WAS A YOUNG FOOL AND HE'D ROPE'S-END ME IF I TALKED ANY MORE SUCH STUFF THE MIDSHIPMAN DID NOT NOTICE IT BUT THERE WAS A QUIET AND SOFTENED AIR IN RAM'S BEHAVIOUR TOWARD HIM AND THE BOY SEEMED RELUCTANT TO GO BUT IN THE MIDSHIPMAN'S NATURAL DESIRE TO GET AWAY HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE BUT SELF
HE WALKED FORWARD AGAIN
IF IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THEM IT WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US LAD
THIS HE HAD PLACED INSIDE THE BREAST OF HIS WOOLLEN SHIRT READY FOR USE IF WANTED BUT IT PROMISED TO HURT HIM MORE THAN ANY ENEMY AND HE WISHED HE HAD LEFT IT ON BOARD
PRODUCED BY NICK HODSON OF LONDON ENGLAND CUTLASS AND CUDGEL BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN
HE STOOD THINKING IN THE DARKNESS WONDERING WHICH WAY HE HAD BETTER TRY
WHAT SHOULD I SAY WHEN YOU WERE GONE NOTHING CRIED THE PRISONER
HE STOOD LISTENING TILL NOT A SOUND COULD BE HEARD AND THEN HE DREW BACK FROM THE WINDOW THINKING ABOUT HIS NEXT COURSE GAZING OUT INTO THE DARKNESS THE WHILE AND WISHING HE COULD HAVE STEPPED OUT LEAPED DOWN AND FLED AT ONCE
THE DEW IS ALL BRUSHED OFF AND YOU CAN SEE THE FOOTMARKS I CAN'T MY LAD
IT'S ON'Y BOUT HALF A MILE TO THE COVE
IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE FALL OH I DON'T KNOW SAID RAM LEANING FORWARD AND GAZING DOWN INTO THE VOID
DO YOU NOT HEAR ME CAME IN IMPERIOUS TONES
THE DAY HAD COME AT LAST WHEN THE WAY WAS OPEN AND HE HAD BUT TO CREEP OUT INTO THE FRESH BRIGHT SUNSHINE AND RUN FOR HIS LIBERTY
AY SHAKE HANDS ON IT AND YOU BEING A GENTLEMAN YOU'LL SAY PON YOUR HONOUR OH VERY WELL
HE'D CALL ME A MONKEY AGAIN AS HE DID BEFORE
IT WAS ONLY HERE AND THERE THAT THE PARTY HAD BEEN ABLE TO FOLLOW THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
COME ON MATE LET'S GET BACK ARCHY HESITATED BUT WAS OBLIGED TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WAS BEATEN THIS TIME AND HE TURNED SLOWLY TO HIS COMPANION AND SAID CAN YOU CLIMB THAT ROPE CAN I CLIMB THAT ROPE
AS THE PRISONER SAT LISTENING TO THE BANG OF THE TRAP-DOOR AND THE RATTLING OF THE BOLTS HE COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIMSELF
I SAY DO HAVE A BOTTLE O MILK HE SAID
AND IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO DESCRIBE THE ENCOUNTER THE SAILORS WERE BEATEN DOWN OR ASIDE AND THE PARTY OF FOUR WHO WERE WARNED OF WHAT TO EXPECT BY THE NOISE IN THEIR FRONT ADVANCED TO THE HELP OF THEIR FRIENDS BUT ONLY TO BE BEATEN DOWN OR ASIDE BY THE GANG WHICH RUSHED AT THEM
I'LL GIVE YOU THE FIFTY POUNDS IF I TAKE THE BOAT
NO HE SAID
FOR THE MOMENT ARCHY RAYSTOKE WAS PUZZLED--COMPLETELY TAKEN ABACK
I SAY MR GURR WON'T SHE BE ABLE TO KNOCK SOME OF HER SPARS OVERBOARD I WISH I WAS ABOARD THE LUGGER WITH AN AXE GROWLED GURR SHADING HIS EYES
DO YOU HEAR WHAT I SAY SIR YES BUT I DUNNO WHAT YOU MEAN HERE MY MAN WHAT'S THAT BOY'S NAME CRIED THE LIEUTENANT TO JEMMY DADD IN THE BOAT
I HAVE GIVEN ORDERS TO THE MEN AND I WISH YOU TO MIND TOO--I DON'T WANT TO KILL THE WASPS BUT TO MAKE THEM PRISONERS YES SIR I SEE THEY ARE NOT FRENCH WASPS OR DUTCH WASPS BUT ENGLISH
LIEUTENANT BROUGH'S DESPATCH HAD OF COURSE BEEN SENT IN AND HE OBTAINED PRAISE AND PRIZE-MONEY
WON'T GET ANYTHING OUT O THEM HE MUTTERED AS HE WATCHED THE RETURNING BOATS
THEN MOVED BY THE COGITATIONS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INDULGING HE SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY ROSE SOMETHING AFTER THE FASHION OF A COW AND BEGAN TO GO SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY CELIA HOURS BEFORE
NOT WOUNDED ARE YOU
ONLY THE OARS LAD
THE ROCK WAS OUT EVEN OF THE PERPENDICULAR AND NO SANE PERSON WOULD ATTEMPT TO DROP FROM THE EDGE SO GREAT A DISTANCE AS THAT
DON'T SEE ME GETTING OUT O TEMPER WITH EVERYBODY AND SPITTING AND SWEARING LIKE A MAD TOM-CAT
WATER'S PRECIOUS DEEP HERE
HE HAS FOLLOWED A RABBIT TO ITS HOLE
NOW CRIED THE GIRL DIRECTLY SIR
THEY WERE COMING ON STEADILY AND HE KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE
SO'S THE FLYING DUTCHMAN WHAT
IT'S HORRIBLY HARD WORK HARD WORK
BUT HE FELT HIS WAY ROUND THIS GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE LISTENED MADE OUT WHICH WAY THE FOOTSTEPS WERE GOING FOLLOWED ON AND CAUGHT HIS FEET AGAINST SOMETHING WHICH THREW HIM FORWARD ON TO A PILE OF BROKEN STONE
THERE'S NO GETTING NO FARTHER THAN THIS NOT WITH A ROPE WELL WITH A VERY LONG ONE YOU MIGHT SLIDE DOWN TO THE WATER BUT WHAT'S THE GOOD WITHOUT THERE WAS A BOAT WAITING
IT'S A GREAT OPEN PLACE SUPPORTED BY PILLARS BIG ENOUGH TO LOSE YOURSELVES IN
AS THEY DISAPPEARED AMONG THE TREES SIR RISDON STOOPED DOWN AND KISSED HIS CHILD'S FOREHEAD PASSIONATELY
AND NOW HE SAT THERE IN THE DARKNESS WAFTING SO EXULTANT THAT HIS SEAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A THRONE INSTEAD OF A WORN-OUT SAIL STRETCHED OVER A MASS OF STONE
THE MOMENT WE TOUCH UP WITH YOU OUT WITH YOUR CUTLASHES AND DOWN WITH ANY MAN WHO DOES NOT SURRENDER AY AY SIR CHEERED THE MEN
NO NO SHOUTED THE MIDSHIPMAN AS A FRESH KEG EXPLODED
AND I DIDN'T LIKE TO USE MY CUTLASH WISH WE'D TOOK A PRISONER OR KNOCKED ONE OR TWO DOWN
LET'S GET ON AND WE SHALL BE MARCHING THEM ALL OUT TIED TWO AND TWO BEFORE THEY'RE MUCH OLDER THE PARTY KEPT ON ALONG THE RUGGED UNDULATING TOP OF THE CLIFFS TILL AFTER A CAREFUL INSPECTION IN ALL DIRECTIONS ARCHY DECLARED THAT THEY MUST NOW BE OVER THE CAVERN
IF YOU GO UP IT GETS MORE DANGEROUS EVERY MINUTE BECAUSE YOU HAVE FARTHER TO FALL
KNOW THE WAY BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST ME SAID ARCHY ANGRILY
PULL MY LADS PULL CRIED MASTER AND BOATSWAIN
BUT NO
BUT NO
BUT NO
I CANNOT
JEMMY DADD--CAME FROM THE COVE
AS HE SAT THERE LISTENING TO THE DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS AND FEELING MORE AND MORE THAT IT WAS QUITE TRUE,--ESCAPE MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE DOWN THE CLIFF OR ELSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM WITH THE OPENING UNGUARDED,--THERE WAS THE DULL HEAVY REPORT OF THE CLOSING TRAP-DOOR AND THE RATTLE AND SNAP OF BOLTS AND THAT FOLLOWED BY THE RUMBLING DOWN OF THE PIECES OF STONE
AND ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE DOOR WAS OPEN YES WHY DIDN'T YER RUN AWAY HOW COULD I AND LEAVE YOU TO FALL OFF THAT PLACE DUNNO
AND AFTER MAKING A VERY HEARTY MEAL THE MIDSHIPMAN ALMOST WISHED THAT HE HAD RAM THERE TO TALK TO AS A HUMBLE COMPANION IN THAT WEARY SOLITUDE
LIEUTENANT BROUGH WENT INTO A FIT OF PASSION
GULLS FLOATING WITHOUT EFFORT NOW HIGH UP NOW LOW DOWN THEIR BREASTS OF PUREST WHITE THEIR BACKS OF DELICATE GREY AND THEIR WONDERING EYES GAZING AT THE ROUGH-LOOKING FISHER-LAD WHO CREPT OUT OF A HOLE IN THE FACE OF THE CLIFF MADE HIS WAY FROM SHELF TO SHELF EVER UP AND UP TILL HE WAS ON THE GRASS AT THE TOP WHERE HE LAY DOWN TO WAIT TILL NIGHT FOR FEAR OF BEING SEEN AND DRAGGED BACK
AND SO IT WAS YES SAID LADY GRAEME IT WAS OH MAMMA DEAR PRAY DON'T SAY THAT
GOING DOWN TO HELP MAY I FATHER SHACKLE GRUNTED
NO CERTAINLY NOT
NOW MY LAD RUN HER ALONGSIDE OF THE COW--I MEAN OF THE OTHER BOAT CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
AND WHEN I MAKE MY REPORT AND SEND IN MY DESPATCHES AND ASK FOR AN APPOINTMENT I SHALL BE TOLD I DO MY WORK TOO WELL ON THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE AND THAT THEY CANNOT SPARE SO VALUABLE AN OFFICER FROM THE STATION
SHALL I TELL OLD GRAEME
AND HE WENT SOFTLY FORWARD TOWARD WHERE A GROUP OF MEN WERE LEANING OVER THE BULWARKS PEERING INTO THE DARKNESS AND LISTENING TO THE TIDE AS IT GURGLED IN AND OUT OF THE ROCKS LITTLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
CAUSE SHE'LL KICK IT OVER DIRECTLY NOT SHE
RAM CAME UP AND HELD THE LANTHORN OVER HIM
BUT BEFORE THAT THE SKIPPER MAY HAVE SEEN THEM AND THOUGH HE'S SHORT-HANDED THEY COULD MANAGE TO SHAKE OUT A SAIL OR TWO AND MANAGE A GUN YOU WOULD NOT PUT BACK THEN AFTER SEEING THESE LIGHTS NOT LIKELY WITH THE ORDERS WE'VE GOT SIR SAID THE MASTER
THE HAIL WAS FOLLOWED BY A SHARP BURST OF BARKING AND THE DOG CAME BOUNDING UP AGAIN TO STAND LOOKING AFTER HER BARKING AGAIN BEFORE ONCE MORE DESCENDING
BUT HIS FATHER AND SEVERAL OTHER MEN ENTERED THE QUARRY AND SOMETHING WAS BROUGHT IN--WHAT HE DID NOT SEE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS TO JUMP AND HE KNEW IT--DEATH--CERTAIN DEATH TO BOTH
FATHER KNOW'D YOU'D HIT ME LIKE THAT HE'D HALF KILL YOU THERE WAS A PAUSE AND A SOB OF RELIEF STRUGGLED FROM ARCHY'S BREAST
SHE MUST HA SMELLED HIM OUT PLACE BEEN OPENED NO FARMER SHACKLE SCRATCHED HIS NOSE ON BOTH SIDES WITH THE NETTING-NEEDLE
ON PREVIOUS DAYS HE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THE LAD'S APPROACH AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BREAK THE MONOTONY OF HIS CAPTIVITY BUT NOW HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO HAVE KNOWN THAT BY SOME ACCIDENT THE LAD WOULD BE KEPT AWAY
WHERE ARE THE REST REST SAID RAM LOOKING ROUND
LAUGHING AT US AND KNOWING WE SHOULD FIND OUT NOTHING WHILE THEY KNEW ALL THE TIME THE FIRST THING PLAINLY VISIBLE AS THE BOAT APPROACHED THE CUTTER WAS THE HEAD OF TALLY GAZING CONTEMPLATIVELY AT THEM OVER THE SIDE AS IF ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT NEWS THERE WAS FROM HOME AND DIRECTLY AFTER RAM AND JEMMY LOOKED OVER IN A QUIET STOLID WAY AS IF NOT TROUBLED IN THE LEAST BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE PRISONERS
BRING HIM ALONG JEMMY HE SAID
THEN QUITE EXCITEDLY SAY LAD LOOKYE YONDER HE WHISPERED
SURRENDER A YELL OF DERISION CAME FROM THE BOAT AND RAM JUMPED UP AND WAVED HIS RED CAP WITH THE EFFECT THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SOME OF THE DYE HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO ARCHY'S FACE WHICH A MINUTE SOONER HAD BEEN RATHER PALE WITH EXCITEMENT
AND HE TOLD ME I WAS TO SEE YOU DIDN'T GET OUT SO I COME DOWN AFTER YOU AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE AS I SAID WELL PRAPS I SHOULD SAID RAM LAUGHING
A CHAIR OR TWO
RAM DID NOT HESITATE AN INSTANT BUT DASHED AT THE MIDSHIPMAN TO SEIZE HIM BY THE JACKET BUT ARCHY WAS ON HIS METTLE AND HE STRUCK OUT SHARPLY A BLOW IN THE CHEST AND ANOTHER IN THE RIGHT SHOULDER SENDING THE YOUNG SMUGGLER STAGGERING BACK
SOMETHING BOUT CONSEQUENCES AS SOON AS IT IS KNOWN THAT YOU HAVE SEIZED AND KEPT ME HERE YOU WILL BOTH BE ARRESTED AND HAVE TO SUFFER A LONG TERM OF IMPRISONMENT EVEN IF YOU GET NO WORSE OFF BUT SUPPOSE NO ONE KNOWS YOU ARE HERE SAID RAM
OH IT'S MADDENING HE LOOKED UP AT THE SAILS AND LONGED TO CLAP ON MORE BUT IT WAS USELESS
THAT YOU RAMILLIES YES FATHER WELL I THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT
I ONLY SAYS TO YOU THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DROP TO BE GOT IN A PLACE I KNOWS AND IF YOU CARE TO SAY TO A CHAP LIKE ME--NEVER YOU MIND WHO HE IS--SHOW ME WHERE THIS DROP OF HOLLANDS GIN IS TO BE GOT AND I'LL GIVE YOU--FOR HIM YOU KNOW--FIFTY POUNDS IT WOULD BE DONE LOOK HERE MY LAD IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY VALUABLE INFORMATION TO GIVE WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR YOU TO SPEAK OUT PLAINLY DIDN'T COME TWENTY MILE IN MY BOAT AND GET HERE IN THE DARK FOR YOU TO TEACH ME HOW TO KETCH FISH MASTER ORFICER TWENTY MILES SAID THE LIEUTENANT SHARPLY
FATHER SAYS YOU WERE TO TAKE ALL THAT YES THEN THERE'S A CARGO COMING ASHORE TO-NIGHT RAM YES MOTHER AND THE CUTTER'S LYING A MILE OUT OH DEAR DEAR DEAR CRIED THE WOMAN
AND IT HAS TUMBLED OFF THE CLIFF AND IS SWIMMING FOR ITS LIFE SAID THE LAD CLOSING THE GLASS
NO FATHER'S RIGHT
WANT SOME MORE MILK HE SAID WITH A GRIN
NOT THEY
THE FACT IS WE HAVE LANDED TO SEARCH FOR A QUANTITY OF SMUGGLED THINGS AND TO MAKE A CAPTURE OF THE SMUGGLERS IF WE CAN CELIA LOOKED AT HIM WILDLY AND HER FACE GREW MORE AND MORE WHITE
HANG THE WATCH
THE DULL SOUND WAS FOLLOWED BY A FAINT CLATTER AND ALL WAS BLACK DARKNESS AGAIN FOR RAGING WITH HUNGER AND ANNOYANCE AS THE BOY WAS TIGHTLY HELD THE LIGHT DOWN JUST IN FRONT OF HIM WITHOUT ANY WARNING ARCHY DREW BACK SLIGHTLY DELIVERED ONE QUICK SHARP KICK FULL AT THE LANTHORN AND IT FLEW RIGHT AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS
WE'LL MAKE THEM DO IT LATER ON CRIED ARCHY WHOSE YOUTH AND ACTIVITY HELPED HIM TO GET ON FIRST
I COULD TEACH YOU HOW TO PLAY ONE TOON ARCHY REMAINED SILENT AS HE SAT ON A STONE LISTENING CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO THE LAD'S WORDS
CAN YOU LEND US A ROPE WHO ARE YOU BOY SAID THE LIEUTENANT MARCHING UP
NOT VERY GOOD WORK FOR ONE'S CLOTHES
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
YOU CONTEMPTIBLE YOUNG SMUGGLING THIEF
UGH HE NOW CRIED IF I ONLY COULD GET OUT HE SAT DOWN UPON THE ROUGH STONES FEELING WEAK AND PERSPIRING PROFUSELY
FIVE MINUTES AFTER YOU LEAVE THE SIDE HERE OUGHT TO MAKE THE SMUGGLER OURS
BUT NOW IN A HALF-SHRINKING FOOLISH WAY DICK PULLED HIS FORELOCK AND MADE A KICK OUT BEHIND
THE PLACE IS DARK AS PITCH AND WE HAVE NO LIGHTS THEN WE'LL STRIKE SOME WITH OUR PISTOL LOCKS AND SET FIRE TO SOME WOOD
GOT HIM CAME UP AS A THRILL OF HORROR RAN ALONG THE CHAIN AT THAT WORD CAN'T
HE CROUCHED DOWN AS LOW AS HE COULD NOT DARING TO RAISE EVEN HIS HEAD AND WONDERING WHETHER THE BRIGHT HILT OF HIS DIRK WOULD SHOW AND HE THRUST IT FARTHER INTO HIS BREAST
UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WITH FAIRLY KEPT GARDENS AND TRIM BORDERS THE OLD-FASHIONED BUILDING DATING FROM THE DAYS OF HENRY THE SEVENTH WOULD HAVE BEEN ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH WITH ITS BACKGROUND OF TREES AND FINE VIEW ALONG THE VALLEY OUT TO THE FAR-STRETCHING BLUE SEA
HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A FARMER WHO HAD TAKEN TO FISHING OR LIKE A FISHERMAN WHO HAD TAKEN TO FARMING AND HIS NAUTICAL APPEARANCE SEEMED STRANGE TO A MAN WHO WAS LEADING A VERY MEDITATIVE GREY HORSE ATTACHED TO A HEAVY CART MADE MORE WEIGHTY BY THE GREATCOAT OF CAKED MUD THE VEHICLE WORE
AS THEY ROWED ON THEY KEPT ON INCREASING THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE STEERING SO AS TO PASS ALONG ONE SIDE OF A RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLE INSTEAD OF ALONG BY THE CLIFF AND THEN STRAIGHT OFF
SHE HATES THE SMUGGLING AND USED TO BEG FATHER NOT BUT HE WOULD DO IT
HOW DO MISS CELIA SAID RAM SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH
SEEMS TO ME MY LAD THAT IT DON'T MATTER WHICH WAY WE TAKE WE ONLY GO WANDERING IN AND OUT AMONG THE STONES AND BRAMBLES AND WINDING ALL SORTS OF WAYS
BUT HE SAW NOTHING OF THE KIND SAVE IN THE WORKINGS OF HIS OWN DISORDERED IMAGINATION
NEVER FEEL SHAMED TO LOOK MY BOY RAMILLIES IN THE FACE
ALL COMES OF BEING SENT ON SUCH DOOTY HE BURST OUT WITH
BOB HARRIS GONE OVER SIR WHISPERED DICK
I AREN'T SMUGGLED THEY BOTH SAT DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE RAM UNTIED THE ROPE FROM HIS WAIST AND FROM ROUND THE BIG BLOCK OF STONE BEFORE BEGINNING TO COIL IT UP
YOU'LL HAVE TO ROW ALL THE WAY TO THE COVE AND WALK ALL THE WAY ALONG BY THE CLIFFS
THEM THERE'S THINGS AS YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN NOR NOBODY ELSE CAN'T HE WRINKLED UP HIS FACE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF THERE WERE A GREAT DEAL MORE BEHIND
WHO WAS--OH IT'S THOSE CONFOUNDED BOOTS
LOOKED SUCH A NICE LADY-LIKE GIRL AND ALL THE TIME SHE'S A FEMALE SMUGGLER AND MUST HAVE BEEN SITTING UP TO LET THEM IN AND LOCK UP AFTER THE RASCALS HAD DONE RATHER HARD MEASURE BY THE WAY TO DEAL OUT TO THE ANXIOUS GIRL WHO COULD NOT REST WHILE SHACKLE'S GANG WERE BUSY ABOUT THE PLACE AND HAD COME STEALTHILY DOWN TO OPEN THE LITTLE CORNER ROOM WINDOW AND WATCH FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL THEY HAD GONE
THE COW BLINKED HER EYES AND TURNED HER HEAD TO SMELL AT THE BUCKET WHICH DICK SET DOWN ON THE DECK AND STOOD SCRATCHING HIS HEAD
WHAT IS HE COMING DOWN FOR HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HIS TEETH BEGAN TO SET FAST AND HIS HANDS INVOLUNTARILY TO CLENCH
THINK I DON'T KNOW BETTER THAN THAT
SILENCE THERE SHOUTED GURR
DO YOU HEAR ME SIR CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
ONE MORNING HE WAS THERE WONDERING WHETHER IT WAS NEAR THE BOY'S HOUR AND HE WAS LISTENING MOST INTENTLY SO AS TO GET FULL WARNING AND INSURE TIME ENOUGH TO GO BACK TO HIS PLACE AND WAIT WHEN HE FANCIED HE HEARD THE BARK OF A DOG
I AM ON DUTY
BUT I MUST SPEAK NOT OF HIM I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK OF HIM SAID ARCHY BUT WHAT CAN I DO
THERE YOU ARE SAID JEMMY AS HE SET HIS BURDEN DOWN
WELL I CANNOT BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT BROAD LEDGE SIR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET UP
SAY MY LAD WHISPERED THE MASTER I PITY YOU--I DO FROM MY SOUL
DOES HE BITE SOMETIMES I'M AFRAID
DON'T MIND SAID GURR BUT I'D RATHER TAKE A TOT O RIGHT NANTES OR HOLLANDS AY SO WOULD I SAID SHACKLE WITH A LAUGH AS HIS WIFE BEGAN TO BUSTLE ABOUT AND GET KNIVES AND PLATES
NOWHERE TO LAND NOTHIN TO SEE
I HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT IT THAT I HAVE FANCIED ALL THIS AND MADE MYSELF ILL
AND HE STRAINED HIMSELF MORE OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROCK TO GAZE WILDLY ABOUT FOR A MEANS OF DESCENT BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE
DON'T BE A COWARD HE SAID
AT ONE TIME HE COULD HEAR THE DULL THUD AND DASH OF WAVES FOR A GOOD BRISK BREEZE WAS BLOWING AND HE FANCIED THAT HE HAD A GLINT OF A STAR THROUGH THE THICK COVERING BUT HE WAS NOT SURE
WELL TIS DARK MONG THESE STONES
IN THIS WAY THE MEN WERE INSTRUCTED TO WALK SLOWLY ON SCANNING EVERY DEPRESSION AND CLUMP OF BARED STONE CAREFULLY AND AT A WORD UTTERED BY THE MAN WHO FELT THAT HE HAD FOUND ANY PLACE LIKELY TO PROVE TO BE AN ENTRANCE TO A CAVE OR QUARRY ALL WERE TO HALT THE WORD WAS TO BE PASSED ALONG AND THE OFFICERS WERE TO EXAMINE THE PLACE BEFORE THE LINE WENT ON AGAIN
CELIA COULD HARDLY SEE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH SHE WAS GOING FOR HER EYES WERE BLINDED WITH TEARS AND SO IT WAS THAT WHEN DOWN IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE HOLLOW AS SHE HURRIED BLINDLY ALONG SHE TRIPPED OVER ONE OF THE MANY LOOSE STONES FELL HEAVILY STRIKING HER TEMPLE AGAINST A BLOCK PROJECTING FROM THE STEEP SIDE OF THE LITTLE VALLEY
I'VE BEGGED YOU HUNDREDS OF TIMES NOT TO MEDDLE WITH THE BUSINESS BUT YOU WOULD AND I'M YOUR WIFE AND OBLIGED TO OBEY
HOW STUPID OF ME HE EXCLAIMED
NO CRIED THE MAN EXCITEDLY
HE TURNED FIERCELY ON THE YOUNG OFFICER
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT
HALF AN HOUR AFTER HE WAS SLEEPING HEAVILY WITH THE DELIGHTFUL SENSATION OF BEING UNDRESSED AND BETWEEN BLANKETS TO WAKE UP WITH A START IN THE MORNING BY HEARING RAM COMING TO THE TRAP-DOOR
IF I HAD BEEN IN UNIFORM SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DARED COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
WHAT'S THAT YOU CAME TO SELL SHE SAID
HIS HEART BEAT SO LOUDLY THAT HE FELT AS IF IT MUST BE HEARD BUT MRS SHACKLE WAS TOO INTENT UPON LISTENING TO THE DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS WHICH GREW MORE FAINT TILL THEY DIED OUT ENTIRELY AND AS THEY PASSED AWAY THE MIDSHIPMAN'S HEART SANK
THINK THE CUTTER WILL BE LONG SAID THE BOY AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH ALL HAD BEEN WATCHING THE FLAME WHICH SEEMED TO FLOW OUT OF THE OPENING FAR OVERHEAD
HEIGHTS OF SEA-CLIFFS ARE VERY DECEPTIVE AND SLOPES WHICH LOOK TO THE INEXPERIENCED EYE ONLY A HUNDRED FEET OR SO TO THE TOP ARE OFTEN MORE THAN DOUBLE
NOW THEN LOOK SHARP WITH THE MILK DICK SIGHED WIPED HIS HANDS DOWN THE SIDES OF HIS BREECHES AND BEGAN ONCE MORE BUT AT THE FIRST TOUCH OF THE BIG STRONG HANDS ACCUSTOMED TO HANDLE CAPSTAN-BARS AND HAUL ROPES THE COW GAVE A MORE VIGOROUS KICK THAN EVER
YOU MAY HAVE THE ONE YOU KICKED BUT IT IS SO DARK HERE SAID ARCHY AS THE BOY PICKED UP THE EMPTY BASKET
THEY FIRED THE SPIRITS BEFORE THEY ESCAPED CRIED ARCHY WHO REALISED TO THE FULL WHAT HAD BEEN DONE
COME ABOARD SIR HE SAID
NOW THEN SHOUTED GURR DO YOU SURRENDER A DERISIVE LAUGH CAME FROM THE SMUGGLERS WHO PULLED THEIR HARDEST PRETTY CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S BOAT WHEN JUST AS THEY SEEMED TO BE COMING STEM ON TO THE ROCKS AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF THE FOUR MEN ON THE STARBOARD SIDE SUDDENLY PLUNGED THEIR OARS DOWN DEEP BACKING WATER WHILE THE MEN ON THE LARBOARD PULLED FURIOUSLY THE RESULT BEING THAT THE HEAD OF THE BOAT SWUNG ROUND AND SHE GLIDED RIGHT OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND A TALL ROCK WHICH SEEMED PART OF THE MAIN CLIFF FROM A FEW YARDS OUT
YOU COME HERE PROFESSING TO BE CIVIL AND YET YOU WON'T HELP ME CAN'T YOU CAN SIR AND YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME IF I DID YES I SHOULD AND I NEVER COULD BE GRATEFUL ENOUGH NO YOU WOULDN'T
HOW CAN I KNOW
I ONLY DID MY DUTY I DON'T HATE YOU SHE REPLIED GIVING HIM HER HAND
WHILE EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN EMPTY IT WOULD HAVE MEANT A SIX MILE ROW TO REACH A LANDING-PLACE AT THAT TIME OF THE TIDE AND AN EIGHT MILES WALK BACK
FATHER'LL LET YOU GO SOME DAY WHERE IS THE CUTTER SAID ARCHY SHARPLY
PRAY GO ON AND THEN RELIEVE MY WIFE AND CHILD OF THE PRESENCE OF YOUR MEN I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR RISDON SAID ARCHY QUICKLY
AND BY THE TIME HE HAD DISCOVERED SOME OF RAM'S PEOPLE IT WOULD BE TOO LATE
AND HERE WAS THE CUTTER'S GIG CLOSE TO THEM AND THE LIEUTENANT READY TO ASK HIM THE MEANING OF THE SMUGGLED SPIRITS BEING THERE
POOR OLD FELLOW THEN
COME OVER ALL AT ONCE SICK AND GIDDY LIKE YOU DO IF YOU LEAN DOWN TOO MUCH IN THE SUN
MAKE A ROPE FAST ROUND HIM I MUST BE AT THE FOOT OF THE WAY IN THOUGHT ARCHY AS HE FELT A ROPE PASSED ROUND HIM AND THE NEXT MINUTE IT TIGHTENED HE WAS RAISED FROM HIS FEET AND THE ROPE CUT INTO HIM PAINFULLY AS HE FELT HIMSELF HAULED UP
HE SHIVERED SLIGHTLY AS HE SWEPT THE FACE OF THE CLIFF FOR THE VARIOUS POINTS THAT HAD HELPED HIM IN HIS DESCENT AND AS HE GAZED OUT THERE IN COLD BLOOD IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN AN EXTREMELY MAD IDEA TO HAVE ATTEMPTED THE DESCENT
BOAT'S CREW LANDED RUN DOWN AND TELL THEM ALL TO COME BACK SAID SHACKLE HOARSELY
THERE WAS NO ROPE AND PULLEY UP ON THE CLIFF NOW AND THE BOAT WAS OCCUPIED BY THE COW
YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS SAID THE FARMER FIERCELY
THEN TOO THERE WERE THE EDGES OF THE CLIFFS WHERE HE COULD STAND AND BARK AT THE WAVES FAR BELOW AND SOMETIMES WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERPENDICULAR DESCEND FROM SHELF TO SHELF
THE PLAN WAS GOOD AND THE LONG LINE SWEPT SLOWLY ALONG THE HALT BEING CALLED SOON AFTER THEY HAD STARTED BUT THE STOPPAGE WAS IN VAIN THE MIDSHIPMAN AND GURR FINDING BEFORE THEM ONLY A ROUGH PILED-UP COLLECTION OF STONES FROM WHICH THE EARTH HAD IN THE COURSE OF AGES CRUMBLED OR BEEN WASHED AWAY
SHE WAS ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM THE CUTTER AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF THAT DISTANCE FROM THE LAND WHEN SHE PASSED OUT OF SIGHT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT OVERTAKING HER NEVER ENTERED THE MIDSHIPMAN'S HEAD
THE SOUNDS ABOVE GROUND HAD CEASED AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SMUGGLERS HAD MADE GOOD THEIR ESCAPE
THE SECOND BOAT'S CREW HAD OVERTAKEN THEM NOW AND UPON RECEIVING THIS INFORMATION THE MASTER SPREAD HIS MEN OUT A FEW YARDS APART TO SWEEP THE GROUND AFTER THE FASHION OBSERVED ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
TIME PASSED ON AND HE STILL LAY PERFECTLY QUIET FOR HE DID NOT FEEL THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO MOVE AFTER HIS LATE EFFORTS WHICH HAD PRODUCED A SENSATION OF THE INTERIOR OF HIS SKULL BEGINNING TO BUBBLE UP WITH FIRE OR HOT LEAD ROLLING ABOUT
NO DON'T LET THE SKIPPER SEND ME ASHORE
THEY'VE STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THIS STEEP PLACE HE THOUGHT AS HE WENT ON AND ON THE PEOPLE STILL ADVANCING FAST AND ALL AT ONCE AS HE WENT ON A SUDDEN THOUGHT RAN THROUGH HIM LIKE A STAB
RAMILLIES NEED NOT KNOW THAT I'M GONE OUT NO DEAR
COME BACK ABOARD HE SAID
I THOUGHT SO FROM THE FIRST FARMER AND I KNOW NOW I WAS RIGHT HE WENT OFF AGAIN AND SHACKLE STOOD SHAKING HIS FIST AFTER HIM
WHY FATHER SENT ME UP ONE DAY WITH A KEG OF BRANDY FOR HIM AND A PIECE OF SILK FOR HER LADYSHIP
I'M YOUR OFFICER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MISERABLE I'VE BEEN YES I DO SIR
LET HIM STAY WHERE HE IS TILL HE FINDS MR RAYSTOKE AND BRINGS HIM BACK ABOARD DEAR DEAR MUTTERED THE LIEUTENANT AS HE WALKED TO AND FRO
BESIDE WHICH HE FELT THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TELL ALL HE HAD SEEN FOR IF HE DID WHAT WOULD FOLLOW WITH RESPECT TO THOSE HE HAD SPOKEN WITH THAT DAY
NO USE TO HOPE SAID THE LIEUTENANT DISMALLY
I AM SATISFIED OH EJACULATED CELIA
TIDY SWELL ON MR RAYSTOKE SAID GURR
GOOD DAY SIR RISDON
SEEN EM MILK THOUGH DOWN IN LINKYSHIRE AND KNOW HOW IT'S DONE THEN OF COURSE YOU CAN DO IT SAID THE LIEUTENANT SHORTLY
HERE FOR A MOMENT IT WAS LOST IN A DAMP HOLLOW FULL OF A HIGH GROWTH OF MARES-TAIL EQUISETUM THAT CURIOUS WHORLED RELIC OF ANCIENT DAYS
SOME MEN'S VERY ARTFUL AS YOU'LL FIND OUT SOME DAY
LOOK SHARP JEMMY THE BOY RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE FOLLOWED BY HIS FATHER WHO WENT ON NETTING AND A MINUTE LATER JEMMY AND RAM WERE OFF OVER THE BARE PASTURES IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE MAN HAD COME
IT CAME BY DEGREES MORE AND MORE AND AS HE WAS ABLE TO THINK WITH GREATER CLEARNESS HE FOUND AN EXPLANATION OF THE FANCY HE HAD FELT THAT HE MUST BE ILL AND SEA-SICK AGAIN AND THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN GIVING HIM BRANDY
WANT ANYTHING ELSE MIDSHIPMAN YES YOU TO GO AND NOT WORRY ME REPLIED ARCHY HEARTILY REPENTING HIS WORDS THE NEXT MOMENT FOR FEAR THAT THEY SHOULD EXCITE SUSPICION
KEEPS OFF THE GNAWIN'S WONDERFUL YAH
I WILL NOT LET HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTY TO RESCUE THAT OLD SCOUNDREL DOWN BELOW NO NO
NOW THEN FOUR MORE MEN HERE
I'M AFRAID YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEARCHED THE GLOVES HOZE SIR HOZE OH WELL GLOVES HOSE GLOVES ALL THE SAME
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE
I'M FULL O SORROW AND RESPECT FOR A NOBLE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE REAL KING WHO WHEN HE COMES WILL SET US ALL RIGHT AH MASTER SHACKLE I'M LOSING HEART NAY DON'T DO THAT SIR RISDON
THERE BREAKFAST MY LADS AND BE SMART AFTER THE MEAL GURR WAS LEFT IN THE CHARGE OF THE CUTTER WHILE THE LIEUTENANT ACCOMPANIED ARCHY TO SEARCH FOR THE HIGH CLIFF WHICH CONTAINED THE OLD QUARRY AND THEY ROWED EAST FOR A COUPLE OF MILES IN VAIN
IF THERE'D BEEN MUCH OF IT WE SHOULD HAVE HEARD THE SOUND GO ROLLING ALONG INSTEAD OF COMING BACK LIKE A SLAP IN THE FACE
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT'S IN THOSE KEGS
WAIT A MINUTE REPLIED ARCHY
NOT VERY SHARP SORT OF OFFICER EH NO FATHER
BRING THE BOY HERE SAID THE LIEUTENANT
KNOW WHERE THEY LAND THEIR CARGOES OH YES
I SAY SKIPPER IF YOU'LL LET HIM COME ABOARD--OH
BUT IT WILL BE KNOWN SO I GIVE YOU BOTH FAIR WARNING THANK YE SAID RAM MOCKINGLY
A RAPID EXAMINATION SATISFIED HIM THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN MOVED AND HE WENT SOFTLY UP AGAIN BASKET IN HAND STOOD STILL AND ROLLED HIS EYES BUT SAW NO SIGN OF THE BASKET'S OWNER AND THEN THRUSTING HIS ARM THROUGH THE HANDLE HE WENT STEADILY BACK TO THE FARM WHERE HE THRUST HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR STARED AT FARMER SHACKLE WHO WAS INNOCENTLY MENDING A NET AND BACKED OUT AND WENT INTO THE ROUGH STABLE
HOLD STILL YOU VARMINT OR I'LL CUT YOUR EARS OFF
WHAT CRIED THE MAN BURSTING INTO A FRESH ROAR OF LAUGHTER
I NEVER SEE EM GO IN THE SEA ONLY HALFWAY UP THEIR LEGS IN PONDS AND STAND A-WAGGIN THEIR TAILS TO KEEP OFF THE FLIES
NO MORE GROPING ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS BITING HIS NAILS AND FEELING HEART-SICK WITH DESPONDENCY BUT THE FULL DELIGHT OF FREEDOM AND AN ACTIVE LIFE
HIS NATURAL INFERENCE HAD BEEN AS HE WAS LYING THERE UPON HIS BACK THAT HE MUST BE IN BED
ONLY A BOY AND GIRL
ANYBODY SEE HIM PUT OFF NO SIR
COME ALONG MY LADS
TISN'T NATURAL FATHER SAID TWO ROLLS OF BUTTER YES AND I'VE PUT THREE
WE SHALL HAVE A PRIZE AFTER ALL THOUGH IT'S ONLY A LITTLE ONE
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SLIP
AH HE EJACULATED
RAM SHACKLE SAID JEMMY GRUFFLY
I WAS ONLY LARFIN WHAT AT YOU
BUT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING
FOR THERE AT THE FOOT OF THE CLIFF LAY A NATURAL PLATFORM OR PIER ALMOST AS LEVEL AS IF IT HAD BEEN FORMED FOR A LANDING STAGE
AS ALL THIS CAME TO HER MIND SHE FELT AT FIRST AS IF SHE MUST RUN TO WARN HER FATHER
A YOUNG FOX
LET'S STRIKE ALONG HERE
WELL THANK YOU
WHERE'S THE SKIPPER HE GROWLED
SO CAN I SAID RAM
WHY IT'S LIKE FATTENING UP ONE OF OUR PIGS FOR CHRISTMAS
BOTH LADS SWEAR AS NO ONE HAS PASSED ALONG THE LANE WOULDN'T TAKE THE UPPER LANE WOULD THEY NOT LIKELY UPPER LANE THOUGHT ARCHY
BUT LOOK ON HER DECK WHAT FOR SAID JEMMY WHO WAS STEADILY PULLING HOMEWARD
RAM ARE THE MEN COMING UP TO THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT DUNNO WHAT YOU MEAN MISS YOU DO SIR FOR YOU WERE WITH THEM
THESE FELLOWS ARE VERY CUNNING BUT WE SHALL BE TOO MANY FOR THEM ONE OF THESE DAYS DEAR ME
LIGHTS SAID GURR
AFTER A WHILE HOWEVER AS HE FELT THAT HE WAS WALKING OVER SMALL FRAGMENTS OF STONE HE PICKED UP A PIECE AND THREW IT TO TRY IF HE WERE NEAR THE END OF THE CAVERN IN THIS DIRECTION FOR HE WAS GROWING TIRED AND LONGED NOW TO FIND HIS WAY TO THE SAILCLOTH TO LIE DOWN AND REST
MR RAYSTOKE AY AY SIR SAID ARCHY GOING AFT AND SALUTING
YOU SEE SIR RISDON WE MIGHT RUN THE CARGO AND STOW IT ALL UP AT MY PLACE FOR WE'VE PLENTY O ROOM
RAM SHACKLE SIR IS--IS THAT YOUR NAME SIR SAID THE LIEUTENANT POMPOUSLY OR ARE YOU TRYING TO GET A LAUGH AT MY EXPENSE RAM STARED
GRIP BUT AS THE DOG WOULD NOT COME TO HER SHE WENT ON KNOWING PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE HAD GONE DOWN ONE OF THE OLD STONE PITS AND QUITE PREPARED TO STAND AT LAST GAZING INTO A HOLE WHICH INCLINED RAPIDLY INTO THE HILLSIDE BUT WAS AS USUAL PROVIDED WITH ROUGH STONES PLACED STEP-WISE AND LEADING THE WAY INTO DARKNESS BENEATH A FERN-FRINGED ARCH WHILE THE WHOLE PLACE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CHOKED-UP WITH THE LUXURIANTLY GROWING BRAMBLES
START UP AND RUN
ALL AT ONCE AFTER A FEW MINUTES PULLING THE BOAT GLIDED RIGHT OUT OF THE BANK OF MIST WHICH HUNG BETWEEN THEM LIKE A SOFT GREY VEIL WHILE IN FRONT LIT UP BY THE FIRST BEAMS OF THE MORNING SUN WAS THE GREAT WALL OF CLIFF THE LEDGE OVER WHICH THE WAVES WASHED GENTLY THE GREEN PASTURE HIGH UP AND THE LEDGES DOTTED WITH GREY AND WHITE GULLS
CHAPTER NINE
IT'S YOUR PLAN AND YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU THINK'S BEST ONLY TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND IF THEY'RE AFTER YOU DON'T MAKE FOR THE SEA THAT'S WHERE THEY'LL THINK YOU WOULD GO
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT NOW OH SAID RAM THAT'S IT IS IT
WE'LL GO FORWARD AND TURN THE ENEMY AND TRY TO TAKE THEM IN THE REAR
THEN HE LIMPED WITH THE PAIN OF AN OLD WOUND
I HAVE LOST A BOY--GONE ASHORE
I SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE A FISHER-BOY NOT YOU
WAS THEY YOUR'N
HIS BLOOD SEEMED TO RUN COLD HIS LIPS PARTED HIS THROAT FELT DRY AND A PECULIAR SHIVER RAN OVER HIS SKIN ACCOMPANIED BY A SENSATION AS IF TINY FINGERS COLD AS ICE WERE PARTING AND TURNING HIS HAIR
WE'RE TOO SHARP FOR THAT CHAPTER FIVE
I WAS WONDERING WHY THAT WINDOW WAS OPEN HERE QUICK
I HAVE HEARED O PEOPLE GETTING A DROP FROM EM AFTER THEY'VE USED THEIR HORSES AND CARTS BUT THAT'S NEVER BEEN MY LUCK
S'POSE I WAS A PRISONER IN YOUR BOAT WOULD YOU LET ME OUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING SAID ARCHY PROUDLY
I'LL SOON RATTLE SOME ONE UP AND HE WENT SHARPLY TO THE DOOR FELT FOR THE HANDLE TRIED IT AND WAS ABOUT TO SHAKE IT AND BANG AT THE PANELS WHEN DISCRETION GOT THE BETTER OF VALOUR
DON'T DON'T SAY YOU WILL NOT GO CAME UP IN THE SMOTHERED TONES
WHAT A POSITION FOR AN OFFICER TO BE IN EH EXCLAIMED SHACKLE TURNING SHARPLY ROUND AS IF TO ANSWER HIS WIFE
MINE CAME IN A LOW GROWL
YOU WERE CLOSE BY ME WHEN THEY RUSHED OFF AFTER THAT BOY SHEEP SIR NO NO MR GURR
AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY LET US SAY IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACT OF VINDICTIVE SPITE AIMED ONLY AT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PROOF SPIRIT SO THAT IT MIGHT NOT FALL INTO THE SAILORS HANDS--NOT INTENDED TO CONDEMN THEM TO A HIDEOUS DEATH
AND WITH APPARENTLY HALF A DOZEN MEN CLOSE BY HIM AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE BY THEIR MUTTERINGS AND THE DULL SOUND OF THEIR FEET OVER THE GRASS HE WAS MARCHED ON FOR OVER AN HOUR--HEARING NOTHING SEEING NOTHING BUT ALL THE WHILE WITH HIS EARS STRAINED WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL FOR HELP IN SPITE OF THE THREATS HE HAD HEARD AS SOON AS HE COULD TELL BY THE VOICES THAT HE WAS NEAR PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT OF THE SMUGGLERS GANG
MEN QUITE READY YES SIR THAT'S RIGHT
AND BE STUCK THERE AND DRAGGED OUT LIKE A RABBIT BY THE HIND LEGS FROM HIS HOLE
LIKE SOME MILK YOU RASCAL BURST OUT ARCHY TAKING A STEP TOWARD THE LAD BUT FEELING DIRECTLY A STRONG HAND UPON HIS ARM TO HOLD HIM BACK
LET THE BO'S'N GUARD THE ENTRY HERE
WHAT HAVE YOU MADE OUT NOTHING NO BOAT LANDED NOR NO SIGN O ONE MASTER
I'VE GOT HIM
WHAT'S THE GOOD SAID RAM SADLY
COWARDS CAME IN ANGRY TONES
SEEING THAT HE WAS SO WELL SUPPORTED THE MASTER FELT THAT HE WAS READY FOR ANY FORCE THE SMUGGLERS MIGHT HAVE TO BACK THEM UP AND TURNING TO ARCHY HE SUGGESTED THAT THE MIDSHIPMAN SHOULD POINT OUT THE WAY INTO THE SMUGGLERS CAVE AND THEN LEAVE THEM TO DO THE WORK
IT'S NOW OR NEVER CRIED ARCHY FRANTICALLY AND HE RUSHED INTO THE BLUE FLAMES WHICH LEAPED ABOUT HIS FEET AND UP AS IF TO LICK HIS FACE
I MUST GET BACK OH YOU CALL MISS CRIED THE BOY TURNING AS HE WENT WHISTLING AWAY
I SHOULD THINK HE DOES
SO HERE GOES AS HE CEASED SPEAKING HE DREW A DEEP BREATH AND THEN FEELING THAT SAFETY DEPENDED UPON HIS BEING FIRM COOL AND DELIBERATE HE MADE HIS WAY FROM THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE ALONG THE LEDGE UPON WHICH HE STOOD TILL HE FOUND A SPOT WHERE HE COULD ASCEND HIGHER
THE MEN SAID HE HAD BEEN PUTTING THEM THROUGH THEIR FACINGS THAT MORNING AND HE HAD BEEN FINDING MORE FAULT IN TWO HOURS THAN IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK FOR HE WAS GETTING FIDGETY
YOU SHAN'T HEAR ANYBODY COME OR GO AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO LOOK IN THE CELLARS FOR A FEW DAYS BUT MY CHILD--THE OLD SERVANT--SUPPOSE THEY HEAR WHAT
THINK WE'VE DONE RIGHT MY LAD SAID GURR AFTER THEY HAD HALF WAY DESCENDED THE SLOPE
WHAT WAS HERE ON ALL SIDES
AS THEY REACHED THE TINY HAMLET A SHORT CONFERENCE WAS HELD BETWEEN ARCHY AND THE MASTER THE LATTER IN A SURLY WAY GIVING THE LAD A FEW HINTS AS TO HIS PROCEEDINGS EVERY SUGGESTION THOUGH BEING FULL OF COMMON SENSE
IT DIED OFF THOUGH AS HE LAY STILL TRYING HARD TO THINK FAILING TRYING IN A HALF DREAMY WAY AND FINALLY THRILLING ALL OVER FOR HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING NOW--THE SMUGGLERS--THE SCENE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS IMPRISONED--THE COMING OF THAT BOY WHO JEERED AT HIM TILL THEY ENGAGED IN A FIERCE STRUGGLE WITH THE RESULT ALL PLAINLY PICTURED TILL HE WAS STUNNED OR HAD SWOONED AWAY
NOW THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT OUR TALLY YOUR WHAT OUR COW TALLY HOW DO I KNOW IT'S YOURS WHY IT IS
HE LOOKED IN VAIN FOR AT THE LOWEST PART THE GREEN EDGE OF THE CLIFF WAS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND RIGHT AND LEFT OF HIM THE MIGHTY WALLS OF ROCK ROSE UP FOUR FIVE AND EVEN SIX HUNDRED FEET AND FOR THE MOST PART WITH A SHEER DESCENT TO THE WATER WHICH WASHED THEIR FEET
GET AWAY AND GIVE THE ALARM HOW COULD WE
IT'LL GIVE HIM A TASTE O LIGHT AND AIR
BUT ALL WAS STILL AND THE FAINT HOPE THAT THE GIRL MIGHT BE NEAR AND OPEN TO AN APPEAL FOR HIS LIBERTY DIED AWAY
OF COURSE HE WAS IN ONE OF THOSE THICK MISTS AND HE HAD GONE TO SLEEP ON--ON--WHAT HAD HE GONE TO SLEEP ON
AND HE SAT STILL FEELING THE BOAT LIVE ALMOST IN THE WATER AS SHE THROBBED FROM END TO END WITH THE POWERFUL STROKES AND GLIDE UP THE WAVES HANG FOR A MOMENT AND SLIDE DOWN
YOU'RE A-COMING UP WITH ME
I'LL HAIL
BUT HE COULD HARDLY SWALLOW THE FOOD WHICH SEEMED TASTELESS IN THE EXTREME AND HE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP AND HASTEN BACK TO HIS WORK WHEN HIS HEART LEAPED FOR THERE WAS THE DISTANT SOUND OF THE BOLTS BEING DRAWN AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THE SOFT YELLOW LIGHT CAME SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM AND STOPPED
I MUST HAVE DREAMED IT ALL SHE CRIED JOYOUSLY
HIS NEXT PLAN WAS TO LIE FLAT DOWN IN THE NICHE HE HAD MADE HIS TEMPORARY RESTING-PLACE LEAN OVER AND TRY AND MAP OUT A COURSE BY WHICH HE COULD DESCEND A LITTLE WAY AND THEN PASS ALONG FOR A DISTANCE AND RESUME HIS CLIMB UPWARD WITH BETTER CHANCES OF SUCCESS
SPEAK OUT FOR I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE OH I'LL SPEAK PLAINLY ENOUGH GROWLED THE MAN
WE SHOULD BE BURNED OR SUFFOCATED LONG BEFORE WE COULD GET THAT OPEN AND AS IN IMAGINATION HE SAW THE MEN FIGHTING AND STRIVING WITH ONE ANOTHER TO GET TO THE TRAP-DOOR WHICH REMAINED OBSTINATELY CLOSED HE CLAPPED HIS HAND ON MR GURR'S SHOULDER
AND HE SHOUTED BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
DON'T LEAVE A POOR FELLOW TO BE BURNT TO DEATH MR RAYSTOKE CRIED A FAMILIAR VOICE
BUT THEY DID NOT COME BACK
IT WAS A MARVELLOUSLY BEAUTIFUL SPOT BUT THE OCCUPANTS OF THE WHITE HAWK'S BOAT HAD ONLY EYES THEN FOR THE SMUGGLERS WHO HAD RUN THEIR BOAT INTO A NOOK JUST ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL AND THEY HAD HAD TIME TO LEAP ON TO THE ROCK AND WERE RAPIDLY CLIMBING A ROUGH ZIGZAG PATH
BUT IF THEY GOT AN IDEA OF IT ABOARD THE CUTTER SHE'D LAND SOME MEN SOMEHOW AND COME AND SEARCH ME BUT THEY WOULDN'T DARE TO COME AND SEARCH YOU
I KNOW WHERE ALL THEIR HIDING-PLACES ARE AND WE'LL HUNT THEM DOWN HOORAY SHOUTED THE MEN
I'LL HAIL SAID ARCHY
BRAVO BO'S'N THE BANG WAS FOLLOWED BY A HEAVY RATTLING SOUND PERFECTLY FAMILIAR TO ARCHY AS HE HURRIED THE MASTER ALONG TO THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE
AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE PRESSURE LONGER ARCHY OPENED HIS EYES AND CREPT NEARER TO THE EDGE TO FACE THE HORROR OF SEEING THE BOY'S WILD UPTURNED EYES
HEY GRIP
I DON'T SEE HOW I AM TO BLAME BUT YOU LED THE MEN AWAY SIR NOT I MR GURR
GAMMON MR RAYSTOKE GAMMON
BEST WAY AFTER ALL HE SAID AS HE BEGAN TO DESCEND
HOW DARE YOU COME IN HERE LIKE THIS SIR
HERE YOU TWO JUMP ASHORE AS WE BACK IN
LET'S ROW TO THE LEDGE THEN AND LAND THERE TILL THE TIDE GOES DOWN RIGHT SAID JEMMY AND THEY BORE OFF A LITTLE TO THE EAST MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE SHELF OF ROCK WHICH WAS JUST AWASH
HE HAD BEEN WONDERFULLY FORTUNATE BUT WHAT WAS TO BE HIS NEXT COURSE
BECAUSE I WANT MY LIBERTY NOT YOU
BUT WHO--WHY YOU DIDN'T GO AND GET THE ROPE AND COME DOWN AND PULL ME ON ARCHY NODDED
OH IF I COULD ONLY GET AWAY HE STARTED UP NOW AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN OVER A SPACE CLEAR OF LOOSE STONES WHICH HE SEEMED TO KNOW NOW BY INSTINCT BUT HE STOPPED SHORT DIRECTLY
DARK THEN THE MOMENT YOU HEAR ONE THEY WON'T COME TO-NIGHT MASTER GO AND DO AS I TELL YOU SAID THE OTHER SAVAGELY
LOOK THERE DICK
OFF WITH YOU LANTHORNS WON'T BE NO GOOD IN THE FOG DON'T YOU BE SO MIGHTY CLEVER GROWLED SHACKLE
HE'S VERY SORRY HE CAME NOW AND IF I LET HIM GO HE'LL PROMISE NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE HAS SEEN
WANT ME TO PULL MY HAIR OFF
ORDER HIM OFF
IT'S QUITE EMPTY DICK SAID THE MIDDY LAUGHING
WHY IF I LET YOU OUT YOU'D COME WITH A LOT O MEN AND THERE'D BE A BIG FIGHT AND SOME OF OUR CHAPS WOUNDED AND SOME KILLED AND IF WE DIDN'T WHOP YOU OUR PLACE WOULD BE ALL SMASHED UP AND FATHER AND ALL OF EM IN PRISON AND SERVE EM RIGHT AH BUT WE DON'T THINK SO
HE CAUGHT UP THE LANTHORN CLOSED THE DOOR LEST A PUFF AGAIN SHOULD EXTINGUISH THE CANDLE AND THEN HESITATED A MOMENT OR TWO AS A THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
THEY ONLY WANT TO KEEP ME A PRISONER SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN HALF AN HOUR AFTER AS HE SAT WITH HIS MOUTH FULL STEADILY EATING AWAY AS A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CAN EAT--"A PRISONER TILL THEY'VE GOT ALL THEIR STUFF SAFE AWAY
A LITTLE CONSIDERATION TOLD HIM THAT THE FIRST WAS AT THE FARM
WHAT IS IT WHISPERED LADY GRAEME AS SHE SAW THE UNIFORMS AND WEAPONS OF THE MEN
BUT IT DID NOT TURN OUT AS HE ANTICIPATED FOR HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS NOSE AGAINST SOME ONE'S THROAT HIS ARMS ON EACH SIDE OF A STURDY BODY AND THE ARMS BELONGING TO THAT BODY GRIPPED HIM TIGHT
YES MY LAD WHAT IS IT DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT YONDER BOAT HAS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE LUGGER EH
THE GIRL TURNED WHITE AND WAS IN THE ACT OF TURNING TO RUN AWAY WHEN ARCHY'S WORDS ARRESTED HER
IT'S ALL AN ACCIDENT AND NOBODY'S FAULT
HE HAD HEARD ENOUGH OF THE CONVERSATION AFTER BEING ATTRACTED TO THE PLACE BY THE ACTION OF HIS COWS TO KNOW THAT THE KEGS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND HE SMILED AS HE MADE OUT THAT HIS BOY AND MAN WERE QUITE STAUNCH AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD
DEAR ME SAID THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT AFTER A FEW MORE TURNS UP AND DOWN
THIS WAS SOMETHING UPON WHICH HE HAD NOT COUNTED
HE HAD THOUGHT THE BOY A DULL STUPID-LOOKING BUMPKIN AND HE WAS FINDING OUT HOW OBSERVING HE HAD BEEN
YES MY DEAR BOY
I KNOW IT--I'M SURE OF IT
HE HAD BEEN FAST ASLEEP AND THOSE WORDS HAD AWAKENED HIM
RUN HER RIGHT ALONGSIDE MY LAD
OH IF I HAD MY DIRK HERE I COULD MOVE THEM WITH THAT BUT HE HAD NEITHER BAR MARLINSPIKE NOR DIRK NOTHING BUT HIS HANDS AND A SMALL POCKET-KNIFE SO A DEPRESSING FEELING OF VEXATION HUMBLED HIM FOR A TIME
MR RAYSTOKE TAKE THE BOAT AND SEE WHAT THOSE FELLOWS MEAN
MY DEAR BOY IF YOU CAN HELP ME TO CAPTURE A FEW OF THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE I SHALL GET PROMOTED TO A BETTER SHIP AND YOU SHALL COME WITH ME
I KNOW ANOTHER WAY HE CRIED
SO WILL YOU GAIN A REWARD BY GIVING EVIDENCE OR WILL YOU GO TO PRISON JEMMY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND GAVE RAM A PUZZLED LOOK
NOW MR RAYSTOKE HE MARCHED OUT AND ARCHY WAS FOLLOWING BUT MRS SHACKLE ARRESTED HIM
TELL LIEUTENANT BROUGH THAT MR RAYSTOKE IS A PRISONER KEPT BY THE SMUGGLERS AND THEN SHOW HIS MEN THE WAY HERE THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR CELIA COULD MAKE NO REPLY
NO TALKING LADS SAID THE MASTER AND DON'T SPLASH THE OARS HAD BEEN MUFFLED AND THEY GLIDED ALONG THROUGH THE FAINT MIST IN A GHOSTLY WAY WELL IN THE SHADOW OF THE CLIFFS GURR KEEPING UP A WHISPERED CONVERSATION WITH THE LAD BY HIS SIDE
ON'Y DO YOU LIKE IT DO YOU MEAN THAT A FOREIGN VESSEL IS GOING TO LAND A QUANTITY OF HOLLANDS TO-NIGHT NEVER SAID NOTHING O THE SORT MASTER ORFICER
THERE WON'T BE NO MORE SMUGGLING TO DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO VOLUNTEER FOR HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE YES THAT'S IT SAID RAM CHEERFULLY
I ARN'T ASHAMED TO LOOK HIM IN THE FACE BUT I SHALL BE AFRAID TO LOOK IN THE FACE OF MY DEAR CHILD MISTRESS DENISE SIR RISDON
HOW DARE YOU COME WORRYING A GENTLEMAN ABOUT A DIRTY OLD BASKET WASN'T DIRTY FOR MOTHER SCRUBBED IT OUT BEFORE SHE'D SEND IT TO YOU
NO WAY OUT MR RAYSTOKE IS THERE NO THEN WE'VE GOT EM TRAPPED SAFE THIS TIME SAID GURR AS THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN
WONDER HE DON'T GIVE UP THE OLD PLACE AND GO AWAY
THE LOOSE STONES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE COVERING HE WAS SURE THE TRAP-DOOR HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD OPENED AND SHUT
AND THE MEN YELLED WITH DELIGHT THEIR OFFICER VAINLY TRYING TO CONTROL HIS OWN MIRTH AS DICK BEGAN TO PAT AND APOSTROPHISE THE COW
YOU COULD LET ME OUT FATHER WOULD KILL ME IF I DID
I'LL OVERHAUL HER IF IT'S ONLY TO GET SOME FRESH LOBSTERS FOR BREAKFAST
JUST LIKE A BIG MONKEY IN A SHOW LOOK HERE SIR SAID ARCHY LOSING HIS TEMPER
RUNNING OFF TO HIDE AND DASH OUT UPON HER IN A MOCK SAVAGE WAY
THEN THERE'S ALL THE BUSINESS OF MILKING THE COW ON THE DECK OF A SAILING-VESSEL
SURRENDER
THEN WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IT IS TO ME
DON'T SEEM EASY HE SAID CHEERILY BUT EVERY FOOT CLIMBED WILL BE ONE LESS TO GET UP
THEY HAD BEEN TAKING THEIR CUSTOMARY WALK IN THE NEGLECTED GARDEN AND SIR RISDON WAS ABOUT TO LEAD HIS PALE CAREWORN LADY UP THE STEPS WHEN THE SNARLING AND SUBDUED BARKING OF GRIP MADE HIM TURN HIS HEAD AND HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS LIPS ALMOST WHITE
HALT CRIED THE MASTER
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SAY A THING THAT WAS FALSE BEG PARDON SIR
WELL YES I OUGHT TO SEE HIM
AS TO THE BOATS THAT PASSED UNDER THE ARCHWAY THEY WERE PRISONED TILL THE NEXT LOW WATER
HOLD HIM TIGHT JEMMY AY AY LAD THIS WAY MY GRAND OFFICER WITHOUT YOUR FINE CLOTHES SAID RAM TAUNTINGLY AS HE HELD DOWN THE LANTHORN TO SHOW THE ROUGH STONE FLOOR
RAM LURCHED OVER SIDEWISE HIS SUN-BROWNED FACE MOTTLED AND STRANGE-LOOKING AS HIS HEAD DROPPED SLOWLY OVER ON TO THE MIDSHIPMAN'S SHOULDER WHERE IT LAY FOR A GOOD TEN MINUTES ARCHY PASSING HIS ARM ROUND THE BOY AND SUPPORTING HIM AS HE LAY THERE BREATHING HEAVILY WITH HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED
IF HE COULD FIND SOME BARN OR EVEN A HAYSTACK HE WOULD NOT HAVE CARED BUT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PASS THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT IN WALKING AND WATCHING SO THAT HE DID NOT ENCOUNTER ANY OF THE SMUGGLER GANG ON HIS WAY BACK AND SO RAISE THEIR SUSPICIONS
TWENTY POUNDS SAID JEMMY TAKING OFF HIS RED WORSTED CAP AND RUBBING HIS HEAD
HOW I DO HATE BEING SENT UPON A WILD-GOOSE CHASE LIKE THIS THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO THE COVE WAS PERFORMED ALMOST IN SILENCE
WHY YOU AREN'T DOWSED YOUR LANTHORNS WHISPERED THE MAN
IT WAS RAM AND HE WAS PLAYING PEEWIT
ABSURD
NONE--NONE WHATEVER
WILD DUCKS THERE AS IS FIT TO EAT NOT ILEY FISHY THINGS LIKE THESE HERE OH BOTHER
BUT NEVER MIND MY LADS
HAVING GROWN LEARNED IN THE WAYS OF THE SMUGGLERS FROM THEIR HAVING ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MADE USE OF THE GREAT VAULT WITHOUT ASKING PERMISSION--AT TIMES WHEN SIR RISDON WAS AWAY FROM HOME--CELIA HAD SAT UP TO WATCH THAT NIGHT TO SEE IF THE MEN WOULD FETCH AWAY THE KEGS AND BALES
WHAT'S THAT HE STARTED UP
RAM MUST BE TURNING GIDDY HE WAS SO LONG
TEN GUINEAS
BUT AFTER A LITTLE SEARCH HE FOUND THAT ALL IDEA OF LOCALITY HAD GONE AND HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF THE DIRECTION TO GO NEXT
BUT AS THE EXPLOSIONS FOLLOWED FAST AND THE FLAMES BEGAN TO FLICKER AND PLAY UP THE PASSAGE IN WHICH THEY WERE PENNED ARCHY CLOSED HIS EYES FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO MUTTER A PRAYER FOR HIS THOUGHTS WERE GETTING WILD
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
HE HANDLED BALES WHICH HE FELT SURE WERE SILK AND AVOIDED THE PILED-UP KEGS OF BRANDY WHOSE SICKLY ODOUR WOULD ALWAYS REMIND HIM OF BEING ILL AT SEA
RIGHT NANTES
I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE OH SAID RAM LOOKING PUZZLED
IT'S AS IF I WAS GOING TO BE ILL
HE KNEW WHICH PARCELS CONTAINED TOBACCO
FATHER'S RIGHT YOU CHATTER A DEAL TOO MUCH RAM TOOK THE BASKET GRUNTED BECAUSE IT WAS SO HEAVY AND THEN SET OFF UP THE HILL-SLOPE TOWARDS WHERE THE PATCH OF THICK WOODLAND CAPPED ONE SIDE OF THE DEEP VALLEY AND AT LAST CAME IN SIGHT OF A GRIM-LOOKING STONE HOUSE WITH ITS WINDOWS FOR THE MOST PART COVERED BY THEIR DRAWN-DOWN BLINDS
CELIA LOOKED BEFORE HER WONDERINGLY FOR SHE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE A FALLEN MAN AT ONCE PROBABLY SOME ONE OF THE MEN WHOM SHE KNEW BY SIGHT
RAYSTOKE YOU'LL BE A GREAT MAN SOME DAY
WHERE'S FATHER WHISPERED RAM TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO LOOKED CURIOUSLY INDISTINCT AMID THE FOG
WHAT IS IT MY LAD CAVE CRIED DICK
IT'S ALL OVER NOW AND MY HUSBAND HAS GONE SO I MAY AS WELL SPEAK OUT OF COURSE
YOU WOULD BE TORN FROM US
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE CLOSING OF A DOOR AND DIRECTLY AFTER THERE WAS THE SHUFFLING OF FEET AND SHACKLE'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN A HOARSE WHISPER GOT THE LANTHORN BOY YES FATHER OFF YOU GO THEN--ALL
THE MIDSHIPMAN LOOKED PUZZLED HESITATED AND THEN KNOCKED AGAIN
TOO DARK TO SEE WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
COME AND HELP GET OUT
LEASTWISE YOU MIGHT THINK SO ONE DAY HE'S BEEN ALL IN A FRET SAYING YOU'VE RUN AWAY AND THAT YOU'D BE DISMISSED THE SERVICE AND IT WAS WHAT HE QUITE EXPECTED
HE KNEW THAT NOW ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY WALL AND TREE EVEN TO CREEP ALONG THE GROUND IF NECESSARY AND HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE SMUGGLERS TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD HIDDEN THE RUN CARGO WATCH THEM BRING IT OUT AND THEN TRACK THEM TO THE FRESH HIDING-PLACE
THE LAD SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THEN UTTERED A LOW MOAN FOR THE PAIN WAS TERRIBLE
COME ALONG THEN
THAT'S YOUR STYLE ORFICER
ON LOOKING BACK BEYOND THE FIRST BOAT'S CREW THE HEAD OF THE SECOND CREW COULD BE SEEN AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE ZIGZAG PATH WHERE THE BOATSWAIN WAITED TILL THE LAST MAN WAS UP AND THEN GAVE THE WORD FOR THEM TO DOUBLE AFTER THEIR FELLOWS
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE BOATS WERE ORDERED IN SAIL WAS BEING SET AND THE CUTTER WAS AGAIN MOVING SWIFTLY THROUGH THE WATER
WHY DON'T YOU COME ARCHY MADE A START FORWARD BUT HE WAS TIGHTLY HELD
MISSUS YES CAME FROM WITHIN AND MRS SHACKLE APPEARED WIPING HER HANDS
I KNOW YON HILL SAID DICK POINTING TO AN EMINENCE DIMLY SEEN AWAY BEFORE HIM
HE HAD PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT THE CORRECT THEORY OF THIS NOISE THAT IT WAS ON PURPOSE TO HIDE THE TRAP-DOOR FROM ANY PRYING EYES WHICH MIGHT PASS AND PRYING EYES MUST BE FEW HE FELT OR ELSE THE SMUGGLERS WOULD NOT HAVE HAD RECOURSE TO SO CLUMSY A CONTRIVANCE
DOES IT COME OFF DICK HE SAID
IT IS ONLY WHERE THEY USED TO DIG OUT THE STONE A SUDDEN BURST OF BARKING TOOK HER ATTENTION TO THE DOG WHO CAME BOUNDING UP THE RUGGED STEPS RIGHT TO HER FEET LOOKED AT HER WITH HIS GREAT INTELLIGENT EYES AND BEFORE SHE COULD STOP HIM RUSHED DOWN AGAIN WHERE SHE COULD HEAR HIM SCRATCHING AND THERE WAS A SOUND WHICH SHE KNEW WAS CAUSED BY HIS MOVING A PIECE OF STONE SUCH AS SHE COULD SEE LYING AT THE SIDE IN BROKEN FRAGMENTS AND OF THE KIND DUG IN THIN LAYERS AND USED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD INSTEAD OF TILES
RAM WAS FAR BELOW UNDER THE PROJECTING ROCK
AND SOON AFTER FEELING FAGGED OUT HE WAS FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMING THAT WHENEVER HE PILED THE KEGS UP THEY KEPT ON ROLLING DOWN ABOUT HIM AND THAT THE MIDSHIPMAN FROM THE WHITE HAWK STOOD LOOKING ON AND LAUGHING AT HIM FOR BEING CLUMSY AND THEN HE AWOKE FANCYING HE WAS CALLED
I MET FIRST MAN RIGHT
NOTHIN COMES OFF SAID THE MAN DOLEFULLY
APOLOGISE AND I'LL GIVE THE ORDER TO MARCH
I CAN FIND MY WAY
WHERE IS THE FISHERMAN HE SAID
ARCHY RAYSTOKE'S SENSE OF WEARINESS RAPIDLY PASSED OFF AS THE OARS SPLASHED AND THE BOAT GLIDED SOFTLY OUT OF THE WATERS OF THE COVE BETWEEN THE TWO HUGE CORNERS OF ROCK WHICH GUARDED THE ENTRANCE AND THEN BEGAN TO DANCE UP AND DOWN AS SHE REACHED OUT INTO THE TIDEWAY
THEN THERE WAS A WHISPER AND DIRECTLY AFTER HE KNEW THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE COMING QUICKLY TOWARD HIM
THE DEEP WATER CAME RIGHT UP TO ITS EDGE AND HERE AT A CHOSEN TIME OF TIDE A LUGGER COULD LIE CLOSE IN AND HER BUSY CREW AND THEIR HELPMATES LAND KEG AND BALE UPON THE HUGE LEDGE,--A FLOOR OF INTENSELY HARD STONE FULL OF GREAT AMMONITES MANY A COUPLE OF FEET ACROSS MONSTERS OF SHELL-FISH WHICH HAD GRADUALLY SETTLED DOWN AND DIED WHEN THE STONE IN WHICH THEY LAY HAD BEEN SOFT MUD
I'VE BEEN IN BED THREE DAYS I AM SORRY FOR YOU SAID ARCHY
SAY MASTER WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE A MAN IF HE SHOWED YOU WHERE THEY WERE TEN GUINEAS
HE HAD BEEN LEADING THE HORSE ALONG WHAT WAS CALLED IN FREESTONE A ROAD THOUGH ITS ONLY PRETENSIONS TO BEING A ROAD WAS THAT IT LED FROM SHACKLE'S FARM TO THE FIELDS WHICH BORDERED THE CLIFF AND CONSISTED OF TWO DEEP CHANNELS MADE BY THE FARM TUMBRIL WHEELS AND A SHALLOW TRACK FORMED BY HORSES HOOFS THE SAID CHANNELS BEING MORE OFTEN FULL OF WATER THAN OF MUD AND BOASTING THE QUALITY OF NEVER EVEN IN THE HOTTEST WEATHER BEING DRY
I CAN'T HEAR YOU CAME FROM BELOW
DON'T--DON'T CRY OUT
AND HE TORE OFF THE LID
AND I DIDN'T DID I NO
CALLING UP THE COWS FROM THE CLIFF PASTURES HE DID NOT MIND BECAUSE COWS WALKED SLOWLY
BUT GROWING HOTTER IN THE CHASE AND DELIGHTED WITH THE SPORT WHICH CAME LIKE A RELIEF FROM THEIR MONOTONOUS TOIL THE JACKS PUT THEIR QUARRY UP AGAIN TO GET A DIM VIEW OF IT AND FOLLOW IT IN FULL CRY LIKE A PACK OF HOUNDS OVER THE ROUNDED TOP OF THE HILL DOWN THE OTHER SIDE INTO A DAMP HOLLOW FULL OF TALL REEDS THROUGH WHICH THE MEN HAD TO BEAT AGAIN PANTING AND REGAINING THEIR BREATH BUT TOO EXCITED BY THE CHASE TO NOTICE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THEY HAD GONE AND BEYOND HEARING OF THE RECALL SHOUTED BY THEIR OFFICERS
IT WAS EVIDENT TOO THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW OF HIS PRESENCE AND WITH HIS HEART BEATING WITH HOPES OF ESCAPE AS HE MORE AND MORE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE BOYS OF THE GANG HE BACKED SOFTLY UP THE STEPS MORE AND MORE INTO THE DARKNESS TILL FURTHER PROGRESS WAS STAYED BY A DOOR
JUST A SHADE MORE MY LADS CAME UP
DUNNO BEEN TO SHOW THE LIGHTS YES WAS THERE ANY FOG UP THERE NO
IT'S MY TURN NOW RAM BUT HE REPENTED HIS WORDS DIRECTLY AS HE SAW THE REPROACHFUL LOOK THE BOY DARTED AT HIM
SHOULD HE GIVE NOTICE TO THEM ON THE CUTTER
THERE WAS A STIFF SLOPE BEYOND AND ANOTHER MASS OF CLIFF LOOMED UP RISING DIMLY AGAINST THE SKY IN A WAY THAT MADE ARCHY FEEL CERTAIN THAT THOUGH SO FAR THEIR SEARCH HAD BEEN IN VAIN THEY HAD NOW BEFORE THEM THE HUGE CLIFF WHICH HELD THE SMUGGLERS STORE
GETTING IT AWAY ANOTHER
REMEMBER THE COW FALLING OFF THE CLIFF RAM AY SIR THAT I DO
REVENUE BOATS HAD OF COURSE FROM TIME TO TIME AS THEY EXPLORED THE COAST NOTED THIS NATURAL LANDING-PLACE BUT AS THERE WAS ONLY A BROAD STEP TWENTY FEET ABOVE THIS TO FORM ANOTHER PLATFORM AND THEN THE CLIFFS RAN STRAIGHT UP TWO HUNDRED FEET SLIGHTLY INCLINED OVER TOWARD THE SEA AND THE EXISTENCE OF EVEN A MODERATE SURF WOULD HAVE MEANT WRECK IT WAS NEVER EVEN DEEMED LIKELY THAT THERE WAS DANGER HERE AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS LEFT UNWATCHED
BUT TWO O YOUR CHAPS KEEP WHISPERING FOR'ARD AND IT COMES BACK OFF THE CLIFF
IF I COULD ONLY HAVE GOT THE LUGGER TOO RAYSTOKE HE CRIED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GLORIOUS
HULLO CRIED ARCHY
I SAY HAVE YOU BROUGHT NEWS OF THE BOY WHAT BOY HAVEN'T YOU COME TO TELL ME WHERE HE IS HERE WHAT YER TALKING ABOUT GROWLED THE MAN
AND OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE NONE UNTIL YOU HAVE PASSED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING INTERFERING HERE WITH HONEST MEN GETTING THEIR LIVING
AND TO PASS AWAY THE TIME HE OPENED THE BASKET RAM HAD NOW LEFT IN PLACE OF THE OTHER AND FORCED HIMSELF TO EAT
HOW PRETTY SHE LOOKS AND HE STOPPED SHORT TO ADMIRE HER THE SHE BEING THE WHITE HAWK WHICH LAY MOTIONLESS ON THE CALM SEA
MEN WERE EVIDENTLY LAUGHING AND TALKING LOUDLY AND THE SOUNDS SEEMED TO COME ROUND A CORNER TO BECOME PLAINER ALL AT ONCE
I SHALL HAVE MURDERED THE POOR FELLOW GROANED ARCHY
NO SIR NOT IT THEN THEY HAVE RUN HER UP ON THE LEDGE AND DRAGGED HER INTO ONE OF THE HOLES
I LISTENED TO HIS INSIDIOUS PERSUASION AND TRIED TO MAKE MYSELF BELIEVE THAT I WAS GUILTLESS AS I OWNED NO FEALTY TO KING GEORGE
OF COURSE THEY BLINDFOLDED ME SO THAT I SHOULD NOT SEE THE WAY OUT OF THE PLACE I LEFT NOR THE WAY INTO THE OTHER AH WELL COME ON AND THE SKIPPER WILL TALK TO YOU
BETTER THAT WE HAD STARVED LADY GRAEME CAUGHT HIS HAND AND PRESSED IT HARD
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE AND FOUND IT WE DID SEARCH EVERYWHERE SIR NEARLY BUT DIDN'T FIND IT OH
I'M FEAR'D SHE'S GONE OVER THE CLIFF THEY'RE ALL ON BOARD THE CUTTER WHAT
THAT'S THE PLACE
AND THEN IT'S OF NO USE TO COMPLAIN
RAM HE CRIED EXCITEDLY,--"RAM MY LAD TURN OVER QUICKLY AND LAY HOLD OR YOU WILL BE OFF THERE WAS NO REPLY
THESE HE UNFASTENED THREW OPEN THE DOOR AND DESCENDED WITH HIS BASKET
THERE'S NO ROCKS TO GET ON UNLESS YOU RUN ASHORE AND TARN'T SO DARK AS YOU NEED DO THAT EH I CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT SAID THE LIEUTENANT SHARPLY
AND THEN THE PAIR DEPARTED AS CAUTIOUSLY AS THEY CAME
HE WOULD THUS LEARN EVERYTHING AND BE ABLE AT DAYBREAK TO MAKE HIS WAY TO THE CLIFF SIGNAL FOR A BOAT AND A GRAND CAPTURE WOULD BE MADE
HE COULD SEE IT ALL NOW
NO HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS AFTER A HAIL A BOAT CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS ITS KEEL GRATING ON THE PEBBLY SHORE AND HE UTTERED A SIGH OF CONTENT ON SINKING BACK IN THE STERN-SHEETS
WHY HE IS A PRISONER READY MADE WHAT
BLESS HER
THERE WAS NOTHING SUSPICIOUS IN A SAILING-BOAT MAKING FOR THE COVE BUT AS THE MIDDY LOOKED AT IT THE BOAT HEELED OVER IN A PUFF OF WIND AND HE FANCIED THAT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FAMILIAR FIGURE BEHIND THE SAIL
IT WAS QUITE HALF A MILE AWAY AND HER CALL WAS IN VAIN AND SHE BEGAN TO DESCEND DIAGONALLY INTO THE HOLLOW THE TEARS IN HER EYES BUT A SMILE OF CONTENT ON HER LIPS
AND YOU TAKE MY ADVICE MISS DON'T YOU COME BOUT HERE
THESE CUNNING ONES GENERALLY GET CAUGHT FIRST
AND IF HE DID IT WOULD ONLY BE TO REACH THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND PERHAPS FIND NO WAY DOWN
YOU CLIMBED UP AGAIN AND WENT INTO THE CAVE GOT THE ROPE COME DOWN AGAIN AND THEN GOT DOWN HERE TO HELP ME YES WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY OF COURSE THANK YE
NOW NOW CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN
AS HE THOUGHT THIS LAST HE ASKED HIMSELF WHY HE CALLED IT THE DAMP FLOOR OF A VAULT
I DON'T THINK THAT HOLE GOES IN FAR MR RAYSTOKE WHISPERED THE MASTER
BUT TO THUMP A CHURN AND MAKE BUTTER WAS OUT OF HIS LINE
PITCH YOU OFF THE CLIFF IF YOU MAKE SO MUCH AS A SOUND SAID A GRUFF VOICE BY HIS CAR
GOT THEM MR GURR CAME FROM THE DECK
NO MY LAD
WAIT A BIT HE SAID FIERCELY,--"WAIT A BIT YES I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT A BIT HE SAID SADLY AS HE ROSE FROM THE STONES
NOT QUITE SO BADLY OFF AS SOME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AS MOVED THERETO BY THE TERRIBLE HUNGER HE FELT HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FOR THE BASKET
DOWN WITH THEM SHOUTED THE MASTER AS SOON AS HE COULD GET ON HIS FEET
HE IS CIVIL
THE LIEUTENANT HAD HESITATED A LITTLE AT FIRST AFTER HEARING HIS MIDSHIPMAN'S REPORT BUT HE NOW DECIDED HOW TO ACT
SUPPOSE THAT DOOR AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE HAD BEEN LOCKED BY THE SMUGGLERS
THEY WERE SO CLOSE TO THE HUGE WALL OF ROCKS THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE ALIVE WITH STRANGE MARINE CREATURES WHICH KEPT ON WRITHING AND WHISPERING TOGETHER AND MAKING GASPING AND SUCKING NOISES AS THE TIDE HEAVED AND SANK AMONG THE LOOSE ROCKS AND SEAWEED WHILE ARCHY COULD NOT DIVEST HIMSELF OF THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE WATCHED BY PEOPLE KEEPING PACE WITH THEM HIGHER UP ON THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
MAYN'T HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING LAD MUST OR WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THE BASKET RIGHT
NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT ON THE WHOLE HE DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE PLEASANT TO BE KNOCKED ABOUT
SUPPOSE I SAY I WILL HAVE IT IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOURSELF OFF CRIED ARCHY I'LL BREAK YOUR HEAD WITH ONE OF THESE PIECES OF STONE TWO CAN PLAY AT THAT GAME BE OFF I SHAN'T
THEN OARS WERE THROWN DOWN THE MEN SPRANG ACROSS THE SMUGGLERS CRAFT AND HEADED BY ARCHY AND GURR BEGAN TO CLIMB RAPIDLY AFTER THEIR ENEMIES
YOU MAY WEAR YOUR GOLD LACE AND COCKED HATS AND SWORDS BUT YOU WON'T CATCH US MY LADS
BREAD AND WATER'S THE PROPER THING FOR PRISONERS OH I SAY YOU WOULDN'T GET FAT ON THAT WILL YOU LET ME OUT NO THEN I WARN YOU FAIRLY
AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE WELL WITHIN HEARING HE ANSWERED THE HAIL AND NEXT SHOUTED I'VE COME AFTER OUR COW VERY UNDIGNIFIED PROCEEDING MR RAYSTOKE SAID THE LIEUTENANT BUSILY WALKING UP AND DOWN AS THE BOAT WITH RAM IN IT WAS BEING ROWED ALONGSIDE
THEN VERY STIFFLY TAKE CHARGE OF THE DECK
NAY THERE'S NO HURRY
I WANT TO GET AWAY AT ONCE NOT YOU SAID THE BOY JEERINGLY
IF THEY SHOW FIGHT KEEP BACK ARCHY HEARD BUT MADE NO REPLY AND TOILED ON UP THE RUGGED ASCENT STRAINING EVERY NERVE AS HE SAW THE LAST SMUGGLER DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP AND AT THE NEXT TURN HE MADE IN THE ZIGZAG HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE ASCENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH THE SAILORS CLIMBING UP AND JUST THEN THERE WAS A FRESH CHEER WHICH MADE HIM TURN SWIFTLY AGAIN TO LOOK ROUND AND SEE THE SECOND BOAT GLIDING THROUGH THE ROCKY ARCH INTO THE POOL
ME OR HIM REPLIED RAM COOLLY
KEEP A CHEERY HEART ON IT LAD SAID ONE OF THE MEN JUST BEFORE TO DICK
SHE OFTEN THOUGHT WHEN TEMPTED BY GRIP IN THE DIRECTION OF THESE WEIRD OLD PLACES HOW HORRIBLE IT WOULD BE IF SOME DAY THE EARTH SUDDENLY SANK BENEATH HER AND SHE SHOULD BE BURIED ALIVE
THERE I TOLD YOU SO HE CONTINUED AFTER A FEW MINUTES INTERVAL DURING WHICH THE BOAT WAS SAILING STRAIGHT IN FOR THE CLIFFS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM THE LANDING LEDGE AWAY TO THE WEST
YOU'LL HIT OUR OWN MEN WHISPERED ARCHY AS HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE SLOPE
NOT ABOUT--ABOUT THAT HE STAMMERED
HERE DICK TAKE THAT BUCKET AFT AND YOU MY LADS OPEN THE SIDE THERE AND HELP THEM TO GET THE COW OVERBOARD THANK YE SIR SAID RAM SMILING
NOW THEN IF YOU WILL TELL ME WHERE THE OTHER KEGS ARE YOU SHALL HAVE A REWARD
THE MIDSHIPMAN'S HEART WHICH HAD BEEN THROBBING WITH EXCITEMENT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SANK DOWN NOW LIKE LEAD AS HE WAITED TO HEAR THE SOUNDS AGAIN BUT WAITED IN VAIN
ME MR ORFICER
SIDES IF I SAID I WOULD THERE'S ALWAYS JEMMY DADD OR BIG TOM DUNLEY OR FATHER WAITING OUTSIDE AND THEY'D BE SURE TO NAB YOU BUT YOU MIGHT COME BY NIGHT AND GET ME OUT NO SAID THE BOY STURDILY I COULDN'T THEN YOU'RE A BEAST
BUT NOW THEY WERE IN COMPLETE SHELTER WITH THE LITTLE CUTTER RISING AND FALLING SOFTLY ON THE GENTLE SWELL AND DRIFTING SLOWLY WITH THE TIDE SO THAT THE WHITE HAWK'S HEAD WAS POINTING SEAWARD
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING WHICH THE MIDSHIPMAN DESIRED AND AS THAT COULD NOT BE ACCORDED THE FRIENDLY FEELING BETWEEN THE TWO LADS STAYED WHERE IT WAS
I SHALL MAKE NO OBSTACLE
THE DIFFERENT MEN QUESTIONED CHUCKLED AND ONE ORACULAR-LOOKING OLD FELLOW SPAT WIPED HIS LIPS ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND STARED OUT TO SEA AND SAID GRUFFLY RUNNED AWAY AY SAID ANOTHER THAT'S IT
SET ONE OF THE WOMEN TO CHURN IN FACT THE FARMER NEVER FOUND ANY FAULT WITH JEMMY FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE WAS HIS BEST WORKER ON DARK NIGHTS AND AS HANDY A SAILOR AS COULD BE FOUND
YES HE SAID
I AREN'T A BABY SAID THE MAN AS HE TOOK THREE OR FOUR STRIDES LIFTING UP HIS BIG FISHERMAN'S BOOTS AND SETTING THEM HEAVILY DOWN UPON THE DECK AS IF THEY WERE SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM HIM WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT ON BOARD
RUN WITHOUT AND SEE THAT THEY STORE THEM ALL UP WELL RAM WAS USED TO THE BUSINESS AND HE WENT OFF AT A TROT BREASTED THE HILL DIVED DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW AND THEN PASSING MEN GOING AND COMING MADE FOR THE HOZE ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR MADE HIS WAY ALONG A STONE PASSAGE AND THEN DOWN INTO A HUGE VAULT WITH GROINED ROOF LIT BY A COUPLE OF LANTHORNS HANGING FROM HOOKS
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S CUTLASS AND CUDGEL BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN
BUT THEY ARE NOT LIKELY TO DO ANYTHING WITHOUT HIM HE THOUGHT
IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT THAT MR GURR SAID ARCHY RATHER BREATHLESSLY WHEN WE HAVE FOUND THE PLACE BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD FOUND IT MY LAD AFTER THE TRICKS PLAYED US I SHALL NOT BE CERTAIN UNTIL I SEE YOU ALL RIGHT IN THE CAVE BUT YOU THINK IT'S CLOSE HERE YES
THANK YOU MR DADD SAID CELIA HURRYING THE DOG AWAY AND GIVING HIM A RUN DOWN ALONG THE HOLLOW
WHAT DID YOU SUPPOSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE
QUITE WELL RAM
THEY WON'T EAT HIM AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT KEEP HIM
YOU MUST FIND IT NOW MY LADS HE SAID
THERE NOW THEN MIND HOW YOU COME WHANG
LIE DOWN AND LET THEM PASS OR GO ON HE DECIDED ON THE LATTER COURSE AND FINDING THAT HE WAS IN A LANE BOUNDED BY STONE WALLS HE WENT ON PAUSING FROM TIME TO TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS BEING FOLLOWED
PRIDE IS ALL VERY WELL IN PLACES BUT THERE IS A STRENGTH IN COLD ROAST CHICKEN PLUM PUFFS AND CREAM-CHEESE THAT WILL OR DID IN THIS CASE SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT
FOR NO CAREFUL HANDS HELD IT TO ALLOW IT TO GLIDE THROUGH FINGERS WHICH COULD AT ANY MOMENT CLUTCH THE LINE TIGHTLY AND ACT AS A CHECK
FOUND THE STUFF NO I SAY WELL ARE YOU SURE THERE WAS ANYTHING LANDED THERE LAST NIGHT OF COURSE WE ARE OH I DIDN'T KNOW
BUT THE MORE HE SEARCHED THE MORE CONVINCED HE GREW OF THE EASE WITH WHICH HE COULD LOSE HIMSELF ENTIRELY IN THE DARKNESS AND WHEN HE DID COME UPON ANY SPOT AGAIN WHICH HE RECOGNISED BY TOUCH AS ONE THAT HE HAD FELT BEFORE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE STUMBLED UPON IT QUITE BY ACCIDENT AND THE MOMENT HE LEFT IT HE WAS AS HELPLESS AS BEFORE
BRING ME MY LIBERTY
YOU WOULDN'T BE SUCH A COWARD OH WOULDN'T I NOT YOU SAID RAM SITTING DOWN QUIETLY AND MAKING THE LID OF HIS BASKET SQUEAK
SIT THERE AND SKULK WHILE THE OTHERS DO THE WORK WOULD YOU
S'POSE YOU UNTIE THE ROPE FROM ROUND YOU AND LET ME TIE IT ROUND MY WAIST
OUT WITH IT AT ONCE BEEN A WRECK P'R'APS AND THEY'RE WASHED UP BAH CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
TRY AGAIN DICK ROSE UNWILLINGLY PLANTED THE UPTURNED BUCKET ONCE MORE IN ITS PLACE AND TOOK THE MILKING BUCKET FROM ONE OF THE MEN WHO HAD PICKED IT UP
THIRTY FEET
HERE LADS LET'S CARRY HIM TO THE BOAT NO NO CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN
THE CAPTIVE CEASED STRUGGLING AND KEENLY WATCHED THE VARIOUS PILLARS AND HEAPS THEY PASSED NOTING TOO HOW THE CAVERN SEEMED TO EXTEND IN A WIDE PASSAGE RIGHT ON BEFORE THEM AND SEEMINGLY ENDLESS GLOOM
BUT YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE TAKING YOU TO-NIGHT I HAVE NO IDEA
ARCHY'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO WORK RIGHT ON THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE MONOTONOUS TASK IN THE DARKNESS AND THE FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT COMBINED TO PRODUCE THEIR CUSTOMARY EFFECT AND HE FOUND HIMSELF NODDING AND STARTING INTO WAKEFULNESS SO MANY TIMES OVER THAT HE RESOLVED AT LAST TO GO BACK TO HIS STARTING-PLACE HAVE A GOOD MEAL AND THEN COME BACK
JUST BEFORE ALL WAS COLD AND GREY AND THE CLINGING MIST SENT A SHIVER THROUGH THOSE ON DECK
NO PISTOLS BUT USE YOUR CUTLASSES
SHALL I BRING YOU SOME APPLES ARCHY THREW HIMSELF DOWN AND LAY ON HIS SIDE WITH HIS HEAD RESTING UPON HIS HAND GAZING INTO THE DARKNESS
VAINLY THOUGH
NH CUTLASS AND CUDGEL BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN
AH GENTLEMEN HE SAID
AND A MINUTE LATER THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THEY WENT ON ONCE MORE
LOOK YE HERE CRIED JEMMY SITTING UP QUICKLY AND SNATCHING AWAY HIS HAT IF YOU COMES AT ME--SEE THE HEEL O THAT THERE BOOT HE HELD UP THE GREAT HEAVY OBJECT NAMED READY TO KICK OUT AND GRIP BARED HIS TEETH FOR AN ATTACK
AT THAT MOMENT A PIECE OF SLATY ROCK CAME SLIDING DOWN FROM ON HIGH TO FALL WITH A CRASH AND SPLINTER ON THE ROCK AT HIS FEET
ANYBODY BUT YOU AND THAT MOLE-EYED BOY WOULD HAVE SEEN THE KEGS BEFORE THEM SAILORS DID SEE EM--WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE GRUMBLED THE OTHER
HERE'S THE FARMER AGAIN FOR THEY HAD SUDDENLY COME UPON SHACKLE DRIVING AN OLD GREY HORSE BEFORE HIM AS IF GOING ON SOME FARMING BUSINESS AND HE STARTED APPARENTLY FROM A FIT OF MUSING AS HE CAME ABREAST
KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WENT ROUND THAT POINT INTO THE BAY KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I'LL TELL YER
NOW MY LADS GIVE WAY THE BOAT WAS ROWED RAPIDLY FROM UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MIGHTY CLIFF AND THE MIDSHIPMAN COULD NOT REPRESS A SHUDDER AS HE NOTICED HOW SWIFTLY THE CURRENT RAN RIGHT OUT TO SEA AND FULLY REALISED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES TO ANY ONE WHO HAD TRIED TO SWIM ALONG THE COAST IF HE HAD MANAGED TO DESCEND IN SAFETY TO THE CLIFF FOOT
JEMMY DADD WAS THERE TOO AND SHACKLE BESIDE THE BIG DARK FELLOW WHO HAD TRICKED THE LIEUTENANT WHILE THE REST OF THE CREW WERE STRONG-LOOKING FELLOWS OF THE FISHERMAN TYPE
I'VE BEEN SHUT IN ALL NIGHT WON'T DO SAID RAM GRINNING
COME ON THEN
PERHAPS THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY OUT AND TO PROVE THAT HE WENT SOFTLY ROUND TO FEEL THE OAK PANELLING WHICH COVERED THE WALLS TO COME UPON A DOOR DIRECTLY
LOOK HERE BOB HARRIS--NEVER NO MORE MY LAD NEVER NO MORE BRAVELY DONE DICK WHISPERED GURR
GET THIS OVER HER HORNS AND WE CAN TOW HER ALONGSIDE AND HYSTE HER ON DECK IN NO TIME THE COW PROVED THAT SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO MAN FOR AS THE BOAT APPROACHED SHE SWAM SLOWLY TO MEET IT RAISING HER NOSE A LITTLE TO UTTER A LOUD BELLOW AS IF GLAD TO WELCOME THE HELP
AY AY LAD IT'S A LONG CARGO HE KEPT HEARING
ONLY TO THINK OF ME AFTER WHAT I HAVE LEARNED OF THEIR SHIFTS AND TRICKS LETTING MYSELF BE TAKEN IN BY SUCH A TRANSPARENT DODGE
I SHALL FIND IT WHEN I'M NOT TRYING AND WEARYING OF THE SEARCH HE SET HIMSELF NOW TO TRY AND MAKE HIS WAY TO THE PLACE WHERE HIS VISITORS HAD COME INTO THE OLD QUARRY
WHAT A ONE YOU ARE TO JOKE RAM SHACKLE
THERE HE CONTINUED SHEATHING THE LITTLE WEAPON I ONLY DREW IT BECAUSE YOUR DOG LOOKED SO FIERCE
I TELL YOU I SHOULD CONSIDER YOU MY BEST FRIEND NOT YOU
BY DEGREES SHE PASSED THE END OF THE HOLLOW LEAVING ALL THE BLACKBERRIES BEHIND AND NOW ONLY PAUSING TO PICK A MUSHROOM HERE AND THERE SHE BEGAN TO ASCEND THE SLOPE TOWARD WHERE SHE HAD SEEN THE DOG
IF WE TAKE THE BOAT WITH THE SPIRITS I AM TO GIVE YOU FIFTY POUNDS ME
FRAID I PICKED UP SOME AWK'ARD EXPRESSIONS ABOARD THE OLD FRIGATE AWK-WARD MR GURR AWKWARD YES SIR
HE COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM DOING SO AT ONCE BUT HIS LONG AND ARDUOUS LABOUR WHICH HAD TAKEN THE SKIN FROM HIS FINGERS AND LEFT HIS WHOLE HANDS SO TENDER THAT HE HARDLY DARED TO TOUCH ANYTHING HAD TAUGHT HIM SOME WISDOM ESPECIALLY NOT TO THROW AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WHICH HE HAD WORKED SO HARD
THERE'S PRECIOUS LITTLE ROOM IN THERE WHISPERED THE MASTER
FOR ONE MOMENT ONLY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE FOOD HE HAD LEFT BEHIND TEMPTED HIM TO RETURN
THAT OLD BOGEY HELPS THEM TO RUN THEIR CARGOES NAY SIR I WEAN'T SAY A WORD
COME ALONG
IF WE GO FORWARD WE'RE LEAVING THE WAY OPEN FOR THE ENEMY TO ATTACK THE WATCH AT THE ENTRANCE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT
GRIP DOWN
WHAT'S THE MATTER GROWLED THE OWNER OF THE HAND
HE MUST KNOW THE PLACE THOROUGHLY AS HE HAD SHOWN BY THE CARE WITH WHICH HE THREADED HIS WAY AMONG THE LOOSE STONES AND PILLARS AND IF HE CAME WITH HIS LANTHORN AND MISSED HIM HE MIGHT WALK UP THERE AND FIND HIM AT WORK
I'LL SIT HERE AND STARVE FIRST
ALL THIS SHAM INNOCENCY WON'T DO FOR ME
I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU HERE TILL THE GENTLEFOLKS GET UP AND THEN I'LL BRING EM ROUND TO SEE THE MONKEY IN HIS CAGE JUST LIKE THEY DO IN THE SHOWS WHEN YOU PAY A PENNY
BUT WHO'S GOING TO HOLD MY LEGS TWO MEN MY LAD AND THERE'LL BE OTHERS TO HOLD THEM RIGHT SAID DICK SHORTLY
DON'T TRY TO DRINK WHAT'S IN THEM TUBS
OLD GURR THE MASTER WHO HAD BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE CUTTER FOR TWO REASONS THAT HE WAS A GOOD OFFICER AND A MAN WITH A BAD TEMPER FOUND NO PLEASURE IN THE WALK WHATEVER
HE GENERALLY FED THE HORSES TOO AND WATCHED THEM GRAZE
STEP TOGETHER LIKE THE SOGERS DO
YOU'RE AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN YOU TOLD ME ONE DAY AND YOU KEEP ON TRYING TO COAX ME INTO DOING WHAT YOU KNOW WOULD BE MAKING ME A REGULAR SNEAK
I THINK I CAN LEAD YOU TO THE FOXES HOLE
HERE HE CRIED DRINK THAT AND HERE'S SOME CAKE SENT FROM POOLE AND--TIP IT UP AND EAT AWAY
IF HE KNEW THAT THE SMUGGLED GOODS WERE UP THERE HE WOULDN'T SEND US TO FIND THEM HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU'LL TAKE SOMETHING TOO WON'T YOU MASTER YES
AN IMPOSSIBILITY HE KNEW FOR THE CARGO MIGHT BE ALL GONE LONG BEFORE HE COULD REACH THE CUTTER EVEN IF A BOAT WERE WAITING
HADN'T WE BETTER MAKE IT FAST SOMEWHERE AND THEN YOU CAN ALL GET DOWN TO THE BIG SHELF
IT WAS SO HERE FOR IN SPITE OF THE DISTANCE HE HAD COME DOWN THE MIDSHIPMAN FOUND THAT HE MUST BE FULLY TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA
SOON AFTER OH HOW SORE MY HANDS ARE
BOY--RAM WELL I SAID SHEEP MR RAYSTOKE NO NO BOY
HOW BRUTAL TO LEAVE A FELLOW SHUT UP IN A HOLE LIKE THIS
NOT GET OUT EH
WELL HE SAID AT LAST WON'T YOU SHAKE HANDS AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN CANNOT SHAKE HANDS WITH ONE LIKE YOU REPLIED ARCHY COLDLY
HOW COULD WE SEARCH THE HOUSE OF A GENTLEMAN LIKE THAT OH EASY ENOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT SUPPOSE AFTER ALL HE HAS GOT ALL THE STUFF HID AWAY
SHE SAW THE MEN COME TO FETCH THE KEGS
HE WAS ALWAYS TEMPTING HER IN THIS DIRECTION BY MAKING RUSHES AND LOOKING BACK AS IF ASKING HER TO COME FOR THE DARK HOLES TEMPTED HIM
WELL SIR I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
THE BASKET WHICH HE HAD TAKEN WITH SOME OF THE FOOD THEREIN READY FOR HIS USE AS HE WORKED WAS STANDING BY THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND HE CAST AN ANXIOUS GLANCE SIDEWISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PASSAGE IN DREAD LEST THE BOY SHOULD DETECT THE LIGHT SHINING DOWN
I DON'T WANT HIS RUBBISH--ONLY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP STRONG AND WELL SO AS TO ESCAPE FIRST CHANCE LIKES ME DOES HE MUTTERED THE MIDSHIPMAN AFTER A PAUSE
BUT I SAY LOOK HERE
HE UTTERED A LOW GROAN
BUT TAKE CARE TO CONFINE YOURSELF TO FIGHTING WITH HIM
YOU HAVE YOUR DUTY TO DO
HE LAY PERFECTLY QUIET AGAIN THOUGH FOR HE FOUND THAT ANY EXERTION BROUGHT ON MENTAL CONFUSION AS WELL AS PAIN AND HE WANTED TO THINK ABOUT HIS POSITION
COURSE IT IS WHEN THERE'S NO LIGHT SAID THE BOY COOLLY
FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE FELT HALF STUNNED BY THE SHAKE BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF HE LEAPED UP AND BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE RETIRING FOOTSTEPS WHICH WERE FAINTLY HEARD
I DON'T WANT TO GET MORE SCARRED THAN I AM SOMETIMES NOW GET OUT
THEN FOLLOWED A LONG AND PATIENT WATCH IN THE MOST UTTER SILENCE
NOW THEN WHERE'S THAT BASKET ARCHY FELT THAT HE MUST SPEAK OR ELSE THE BOY WOULD GO IN SEARCH OF IT
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT AT YOU SIR BEGGIN YOUR PARDON
ARE YOU ALL HERE AY AY SIR AND THAT BOY I'M HERE CRIED RAM
I'M GOING TO STOP HERE THAT YOU WON'T SAID RAM SHARPLY
IT SEEMED ALL DONE IN SUCH A MATTER OF COURSE WAY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT RAM WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE TASK AND SUPPORTING THE LANTHORN ON HIS HEAD FIRST WITH ONE AND THEN WITH THE OTHER HAND HE WENT ON WHISTLING SOFTLY AN OLD WEST COUNTRY AIR THINKING THE WHILE ABOUT SIR RISDON AND LADY GRAEME AND ABOUT HOW POOR THEY WERE AND HOW MUCH BETTER IT WAS TO LIVE AT A FARMHOUSE WHERE THERE WAS ALWAYS PLENTY TO EAT AND WHERE HIS FATHER COULD GO FISHING IN THE LUGGER WHEN HE LIKED AND HOW HE COULD FARM AND SMUGGLE AND GENERALLY ENJOY LIFE
WELL I CAN SEE THAT MY MAN
OR WOULD SHE PUT HER FEET THROUGH LET'S TRY WAS THE LACONIC REPLY AND TAKING HOLD OF THE ROPE THAT HAD BEEN USED AS A HALTER THE MAN STEPPED DOWN INTO THE BOAT THE COW AFTER A LITTLE COAXING FOLLOWING WITHOUT PUTTING HER FEET THROUGH AND SHOWING GREAT ACTIVITY FOR SO CLUMSY-LOOKING A BEAST
THEN COME ON FOR THE TOP PASSAGE WHISPERED RAM
TWAS THE FLASH FROM A GUN
AND OVER HE GOES THEN HE DREW IN A LONG BREATH READY FOR A ROAR OF LAUGHTER WHEN THE BUCKET WENT FLYING AND STOOD STARING WAITING TO EXPLODE
CHAPTER ONE
IT IS COVERED WITH STONES
THE LIGHT DIED OUT AND IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE LIKE A FLASH CAME THE ANSWER
PERHAPS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT WAS FANCY OR NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF A HEAVY STEP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR ALARMED HIM MORE AND STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS HE STEPPED FORWARD WENT CAUTIOUSLY ON AND ON AND AT THE END OF A FEW YARDS TOUCHED WHAT FELT LIKE PANELLING
PART WAS FEVERED IMAGINATION PART WAS REALITY FOR THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT FAINT ODOUR OF SPIRITS
NO HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT
NO SAID THE FARMER SAVAGELY
ISN'T RAM A LONG TIME BRINGING HOME THAT COW YES SAID SHACKLE DRILY
PERHAPS SIR RISDON GRAEME WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ASSURE ME NO SIR SAID THE BARONET STERNLY
OF COURSE BUT HOW COULD I SEE IN THAT FOG RAM WAS SOON OUT AND AWAY TO HUNT UP JEMMY DADD WHOM HE FOUND AT LAST WITH HIS EYES HALF-CLOSED YAWNING PRODIGIOUSLY
THE GAME'S UP AND IF YOU DON'T COME OUT QUIETLY WE SHALL HAVE TO FETCH YOU OUT ON THE ROUGH STILL NO REPLY
YOU CHOOSE THIS TIME LET'S TRY THIS WAY SAID ARCHY SELECTING THE ROUTE BECAUSE IT WAS DOWN HILL
ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED YARDS BUT NO SIGN
I WANTED TO HELP HIM BUT HE WOULD KEEP SAYING THAT HE MUST TELL OF PAPA BECAUSE IT WAS HIS DUTY YES SAID ARCHY BLUNTLY
BUT THAT DREAD HAD PASSED AWAY IN THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TO DO HIS DUTY AND BEFORE HE COULD DO THAT HE MUST ESCAPE
IT SEEMED HORRIBLE TO HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE TASK OF GUIDING THE KING'S MEN PERHAPS TO ARREST HER FATHER
YOU KNOW YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAWS BY SMUGGLING AND YOU ARE DOING WORSE BY KIDNAPPING ME SHOULD HAVE KEP AWAY THEN GROWLED THE MAN
I DID NOT BRING YOU A KNIFE BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A SAVAGE ONE WHERE IS MY DIRK WHAT D'YER MEAN
YOU KNOW THE GAME'S UP
BOTHER THE WATCH
MOST STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE BOAT
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO DO TO THEM
BOTH BOYS BECOME FRIENDLY WITH EACH OTHER BUT THE MIDSHIPMAN CAN ONLY EXPRESS IT BY APPEARING TO HATE THE FARM-FISHER BOY WHOM HE CONSIDERS TO BE SOCIALLY FAR BENEATH HIM
QUITE AT HOME
THEN UP WENT THE MAINSAIL AND JIB AND THE LITTLE CUTTER CAREENED OVER TO THE SOFT LAND BREEZE AS SOON AS SHE GOT A LITTLE WAY OUT FROM UNDER THE CLIFFS WHICH SOON BECAME INVISIBLE
BUT THEER I DON'T MIND IF MY MISSUS DON'T OBJECT
WHAT SHALL I DO--WHAT SHALL I DO SHE STOLE SOFTLY UP THE RUGGED STEPS WITH HER FINGERS IN HER EARS IN DREAD LEST SHE SHOULD BE CALLED UPON TO LISTEN TO THE PRISONER'S PITEOUS APPEALS FOR HELP
THEY ARE CLOSE HERE THEN AND THEY FRIGHTENED THESE PEOPLE AWAY I SUPPOSE SO
BETTER JOIN HANDS
NOW MY LADS THE MEN MARCHED OFF AND SIR RISDON STOOD WATCHING THEM
THAT WALL'S NEW
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY AND HE HURT THEM IN MAKING THE TEST FOR HE HALF FANCIED AND HE HAD A CONFUSED NOTION THAT A GREAT HANDKERCHIEF HAD BEEN TIED OVER THEM
OH HANG IT ALL I WISH THE SUN WOULD COME OUT WON'T BE LONG SIR
WHAT DID MR BROUGH AND OLD GURR ALWAYS SAY
LOOK HERE DIRTY DICK BEGAN THE MIDDY WHO BURST OUT INTO A HEARTY FIT OF LAUGHTER AS HE SAW THE BROAD-SHOULDERED SAILOR GIVE HIS FACE A RUB WITH THE BACK OF HIS HANDS AND LOOK AT THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER
HERE HE COMES
I CAME BACK TO TELL YOU THAT YOUR CIDER IS RATHER HARSH AND HARD NOT TO SAY SOUR AND I'M A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO RUM AS HE SPOKE GURR THE MASTER STEPPED INTO THE ROOM TOOK THE BOTTLE FROM THE FARMER'S HAND HELPED HIMSELF TO A GLASS AND POURED OUT AND SMELT THE SPIRIT
THEY DAREN'T WHY HANDS ARE TOO DIRTY
NOTHER INCH AT EACH ORDER GIVEN IN A HOARSE SMOTHERED WAY THE MEN SHUFFLED THEMSELVES FORWARD A LITTLE AND LOWERED DICK DOWN
CHAPTER ELEVEN
YOU'RE A NICE UN GROWLED JEMMY
I MIGHT VENTURE NOW WHISPERED ARCHY
PULL MY LADS AND AS WE REACH THE ROCK OUT WITH YOU AND CHASE THEM
NATURALLY THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS OF FURTHER FLIGHT BUT HE HAD ALREADY CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AGAIN A PRISONER AND AS AFTER ANOTHER GLANCE DOWN AT THE LEDGE BELOW TO HIS LEFT HE LOOKED UP AT RAM HE SET HIS TEETH AND LAUGHED IN A WAY THAT DID NOT PROMISE WELL FOR HIS PURSUER
MY FATHER WAS IN MARLBOROUGH'S WARS AND HE CALLED ME BLENHEIM IN HONOUR OF THE BATTLE HE WAS IN
AND THEN YOU COME SNEAKING BACK ON BOARD INSULT ME BY BLUNDERING UP AGAINST ME AND ALL YOU'VE GOT TO SAY FOR YOURSELF IS `COME ABOARD SIR NOW THEN WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU TO SAY WELL SIR STOP
DOWN GRIP
DOWN GRIP
THEN THE SLOPE GREW STEEPER AND HE PAUSED AGAIN TO LISTEN
I'LL LET SOME OF YOU SEE ABOUT THAT MY FINE FELLOWS HE LED HIS MEN ON STOPPING AT EACH CLUSTER OF COTTAGES AND SHABBY LITTLE FARM TO ASK SUSPICIOUSLY AS IF HE FELT CERTAIN THE PERSON HE QUESTIONED WAS HIDING THE TRUTH
OH IF I COULD ONLY HAVE FOLLOWED THEM UP HIS HEART GAVE A BOUND JUST THEN FOR PLAINLY ON THE NIGHT AIR CAME A DULL SOUND AS OF FOOTSTEPS ON GRASS
YES SIR YES SHOUTED THE MEN
HE WAS SEEING HOW THE GRASS GOT ON THAT PARTICULAR MORNING WITH HIS EYES SHUT WHEN HAPPENING TO OPEN THEM HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF CELIA GOING ALONG A MILE AWAY WITH HER BASKET AND DOG
BUT IT IS MY DUTY AND YES--YES--SPEAK I MUST OH THE INTERJECTION CAME AS IF IT WERE THE OUTCOME OF SUDDEN PASSION
NEVER MIND HER
TO ME IT'S JUST THE SAME AS A MOONSHINY NIGHT BOY
I SAY ONCE MORE HOW AM I TO FACE MR BROUGH I DON'T KNOW MR GURR SAID ARCHY WHO WAS GROWING VEXED NOW AT THE BLAME BEING THROWN ON HIS SHOULDERS
HOW OLD GRIP GROWLED
BUT NO HELP SEEMED TO BE AT HAND AND AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE HE WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG THE FIELDS AND ROUGH GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WILD CLIFFS NOW NEAR THE SEA NOW FAR AWAY
THESE SPOTS ATTRACTED AND YET REPELLED HER AS SHE PEERED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN TO SEE THAT THEY WERE HALF HIDDEN BY LONG STRANDS OF BRAMBLE WITH TUFTS OF PINK-HEADED HEMP AGRIMONY AND LOWER DOWN THE SIDES AND ARCHWAY INFRINGED WITH THE LOVELIEST OF FERNS
THAT OUGHT TO MEAN A GOOD DAY'S BUSINESS MR RAYSTOKE AND PROMOTION TO BETTER JOBS THAN THIS I HOPE SO SIR SAID ARCHY WITH HIS MOUTH FULL
HE DARED NOT STAY WHERE HE WAS FOR IF THE SMUGGLERS WERE SO MUCH AT HOME AT THE HOZE THAT THEY COULD COME LIKE THIS BY NIGHT THE FARMER OR SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT COME UP THOSE STEPS WITH A LIGHT AND THEN DISCOVERY WAS CERTAIN
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT AS SOON AS THE LIEUTENANT IN COMMAND IS SATISFIED THAT YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SMUGGLING YOUR PEOPLE WILL BE SET AT LIBERTY AND THE COW AND THE COW OF COURSE THANK YE SIR
GOOD MORNING
THE RATTLE AT LAST
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF MAKING A FUSS
LOWER AWAY THEN AGAIN LOWER AWAY
I WISH HE'D BE CONTENT WITH HIS COWS AND SHEEP MRS SHACKLE DREW BACK AS SHE SAID THIS THE DOOR CLOSED AND ARCHY SPRANG UP DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY AND HURRIED ALONG THE PATH AS FAST AS THE DARKNESS WOULD ALLOW STOPPING FROM TIME TO TIME TO LISTEN
DARK AS PITCH IS MOSTLY A FIGURE OF SPEECH FOR THE OBSCURITY IS GENERALLY RELIEVED BY SOMETHING IN THE FORM OF DULL LIGHT WHICH DOES ENABLE A PERSON TO SEE HIS HAND BEFORE HIM
HI
HI
HI
HI
HI
HI
HI
HI
WITH A GREAT HORROR COMING UPON HER SHE HURRIED ALONG TOWARDS THE CLIFF THINKING OF WHAT DADD HAD SAID AND PICTURING IN HER MIND'S EYE POOR GRIP RACING ALONG SOME SEAWARD SLOPE IN CHASE OF A RABBIT AND GOING RIGHT OVER THE CLIFF SHE WENT ON ALMOST AT A RUN PAUSING THOUGH TO CALL FROM TIME TO TIME
ONE MINUTE RAM BY ENTWINING HIS LEG WITHIN THOSE OF HIS ADVERSARY NEARLY THREW HIM
BUT NO HEED BEING PAID TO HIS WORDS OH VERY WELL HE SAID I DON'T CARE
YOU DON'T THINK MR GURR THAT THEY WOULD DARE TO INJURE HIM IF HE WAS SO UNLUCKY AS TO BE CAUGHT WELL SIR SAID THE MASTER HESITATING SMUGGLERS ARE SMUGGLERS MR GURR SAID THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT RAISING HIMSELF UP ON HIS TOES SO AS TO BE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TALK SENSE CERTAINLY SIR SMUGGLERS ARE SMUGGLERS INDEED
HERE MR RAYSTOKE
MOTHER SAID IT WOULD DO YOU GOOD NAY LAD DON'T GIVE HIM NONE TILL HE'S GROW'D CIVIL AND DON'T TALK ABOUT HANGING ON US I BROUGHT YOU A BOTTLE O NEW MILK AND SOME HOT BREAD ON'Y IT'S GETTING COLD NOW AND SOME BUTTER AND COLD HAM
WATER BRIMES THUD
HE WAS HUNGRY DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
HE WOULDN'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY FARMER SHACKLE WENT HOME AND WAS SALUTED BY THE QUESTION FOUND MY TALLY YES WIFE DROWNED NO
AND THEN AS IF APOLOGISING FOR THIS WILD GETTING RID OF A SUPERABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL SPIRITS KEPT LOW IN THE MOURNFUL OLD HOUSE HE WOULD COME AS SOON AS SHE SAT QUIETLY DOWN CROUCH CLOSE UP TO HER AND LAY HIS HEAD ON HER KNEE TO GAZE UP IN HER FACE BLINKING HIS EYES AND NOT MOVING AGAIN PERHAPS FOR AN HOUR
HERE YOU ARE STILL YES
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT HERE
THERE WAS NOWT TO SEE AND NOWT TO HEAR AND OF COURSE ONE COULDN'T SMELL IT BUT SEEMS TO ME AS THAT UGLY-LOOKING FISHERMAN CHAP KNOWS WHERE OUR MR RAYSTOKE IS
ARCHY STOOD OUTSIDE WITH A VAGUE BELIEF THAT BEFORE LONG THE MAN WOULD COME OUT AND PERHAPS GO TO THE SPOT WHERE THE CARGO WAS HIDDEN
THERE WAS A REASON FOR THIS ROUTE BEING CHOSEN FOR CELIA DID NOT CARE TO BE SEEN BY RAM OR ANY OF THE MEN WHO MIGHT BE PRETENDING TO WORK HARD ON SHACKLE'S FARM WHICH WAS ILL TENDED AND CONSISTED FOR THE MOST PART OF CLIFF GRAZING LAND
NO SOUND
THE SCOUNDRELS CRIED THE MASTER ANGRILY
MY LADY'S TOO PROUD SIR RISDON SIGHED AND THE MAN WATCHED HIM NARROWLY
HERE RAM YOU THROUGH FIRST AND SHOW THEM HOW TO CLIMB ON THE SHELF NO NO YOU LEAD MR RAYSTOKE CRIED THE MASTER
HER ANKLE WAS BADLY WRENCHED SO THAT SHE COULD NOT STAND AND IN THE SOLITARY PLACE IN WHICH SHE HAD FALLEN IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT LIE FOR DAYS AND NOT BE FOUND UNLESS SPECIAL SEARCH WAS MADE
AND AFTER SPEAKING TO ONE OF THE MEN RAM TOOK HOLD OF THE LOOP AT THE END OF THE ROPE THRUST A LEG THROUGH HELD ON TIGHTLY AND AFTER THE WORD WAS GIVEN SWUNG HIMSELF OFF INTO THE FOG
WONDER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BRING TO-NIGHT HE WHISTLED SOFTLY AS HE CLIMBED SLOWLY ON
HERE HE STOPPED PANTING AND HOLDING HIS HAND UPON HIS THROBBING HEART
TIDE SERVES AND SHE CAN'T BE LONG NOW
LOOK OUT THE ORDER WAS NEEDLESS FOR THE SMUGGLERS GAVE EVERY ONE WARNING TO DO THAT
PICKING A FEW MUSHROOMS SIR I--ER--YES MASTER SHACKLE
YOU HAD BETTER KEEP AS CLOSE TO THE CLIFF AS YOU CAN FOR OF COURSE THE ENTRANCE MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR
AH YOU MAY SAY `BAH BUT THEY MIGHT
FOR HE HAD GUESSED AT LEAST THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE WAS GOING IN THE BLACK DARKNESS
THEN THERE WAS A SCUFFLING AND DRAGGING A LOUD PANTING AND WITH A FEW ADJURATIONS TO HOLD ON AND HAUL AND KEEP TIGHT DICK AND THE MAN HE HAD BEEN LOWERED DOWN TO SAVE WERE DRAGGED INTO SAFETY
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE
DON'T KNOW WHEN I FELT SO HUNGRY MUTTERED THE LAD AS HE THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BREECHES POCKETS AND STOPPED NEAR THE SAILOR WHO SMILED IN THE LAD'S FRANK-LOOKING HANDSOME FACE
BUT NOW ANOTHER DIFFICULTY AROSE
I SAY MR RAYSTOKE YOU'VE DONE IT NOW HALF ANGRY HALF AMUSED BUT ALL THE WHILE SMARTING WITH THE PAIN CAUSED BY A BLOW HE HAD RECEIVED ARCHY REMAINED SILENT LISTENING TO THE HEAVY BREATHING AND MUTTERING OF HIS COMPANIONS IN MISFORTUNE
IT STARTS OFF WITH A COMIC SCENE WHERE THE EXCISE PATROL VESSEL IS CRUISING NEAR AN AREA SUSPECTED OF BEING HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH SMUGGLING
HE'S HOLDING ON LEGS WINGS AND TEETH
HAVE THE BOAT READY MR GURR
WE SHALL BE HAVING SOME OF EM GOING OVER THE CLIFF
AND RUNNING DOWN THE SLOPE THE MIDSHIPMAN BEHELD THAT WHICH SENT A THRILL OF TERROR THROUGH HIM
THE LITTLE CRAFT WAS DOING HER BEST AND THE WATER SURGED UNDER HER BOW AS SHE TOOK A LONG STRETCH SEAWARD BEFORE TACKING FOR THE LAND
NOT QUITE SO THICK UP HERE
IT WAS KIND OF HIM TO BRING THE THINGS TO AMUSE ME AND BETTER FOOD
WHY SHE'S OUR BEST COW CRIED RAM
OH HOW VEXATIOUS HE CRIED AS HE GROUND HIS TEETH
WHEN I GET ORDERS MR ORSIFER AND NOT BEFORE
IT USED TO BE A HOLE JUST BIG ENOUGH TO CREEP THROUGH
MAY I STOP HERE LONG OF HIM
THERE THESE ARE ALL THE EGGS I'VE GOT AND YOU MIND YOU DON'T BREAK EM OH I SAY MOTHER CRIED RAM AREN'T IT HEAVY NONSENSE
WHY IF YOUR FATHER HAD BEEN ALONG HERE WITH THAT RUSTY OLD GUN OF HISN THAT HE SHOOTS RABBITS WITH AND SEEN THAT DOG SCRATCHING AMONG THEM STONES KNOW WHAT HE'D HAVE DONE NO WELL THEN I DO
BUT I WARN'T GOING TO BLAB
HE WENT OUT CLOSING THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND STOOD IN THE GARDEN
THE PRISONER HAD BEEN LISTENING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE SOUND WHICH BETOKENED THE VISIT OF HIS YOUNG GAOLER AND HE WAS LONGING TO HAVE SPEECH WITH HIM
NO BLOWS WERE STRUCK THE EFFORTS OF RAM BEING APPARENTLY DIRECTED TO THROWING THE MIDSHIPMAN DOWN WHEN HE MEANT TO SIT UPON HIM TILL HE HAD REDUCED HIM TO OBEDIENCE
NOW THEN DICK IS IT A SEA-COW CRIED ARCHY AS THEY DREW NEARER
THEN THEY WENT AS CLOSE UNDER THE CLIFFS AS THEY DARED GO IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME CAVERN OR PASSAGE THROUGH THE ROCKS THAT ESCAPED NOTICE FROM OUTSIDE
CHAPTER TWENTY
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SHE'S HAVING A RIDE IN THE SAXHAM COACH I TELL YOU SHE IS
IT WAS A TRAP AND THE MIDSHIPMAN UNDERSTOOD IT NOW
IT IS HORRIBLE
IF A BIT O SMUGGLING WAS WRONG SIR RISDON THINK I'D DO IT
HAD ALL MY TROUBLE FOR NOTHING HE THOUGHT
NEVER WAS ONE POOR OLD CHAP ONLY FATHER GOOD AS MADE HIM LEND US HIS CELLAR BECAUSE IT WAS NICE AND HANDY AND NOBODY WOULD THINK OF GOING AND SEARCHING THERE
HERE ALL GET TOGETHER AND FOLLOW ME WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO MAKE FOR THE TRAP-DOOR--SHARP
THE LAD'S TASK WAS ROBBED OF THE APPEARANCE OF PERIL BY THE DARKNESS
RAM HE SHOUTED
I MUST GO WITH YOU TO ACT AS GUIDE IT AREN'T ALL PASSAGE THEN LIKE THIS NO
IT WAS BRANDY BUT BRANDY IN SMUGGLED KEGS AND THE SCOUNDRELS OF SMUGGLERS HAD SHUT HIM UP IN THE VAULT WITH THEIR KEGS
THEN CALMLY SEARCHING ABOUT HE FOUND FIRM FOOTHOLD RAISED HIMSELF AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS ON THE GREEN LEDGE
OH YES I WOULD SAID RAM SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH
STARBOARD A LITTLE--STARBOARD HE SAID
THEY'LL CHATTER AND JABBER A BIT AND THEIR SKIPPER'LL SWEAR HE'LL DO ALL SORTS O THINGS BUT YOU STICK TO THE BOAT AS SOON AS YOUR LADS ARE ON BOARD TRUST ME FOR THAT SAID THE LIEUTENANT
THE MINUTE BEFORE HE HAD BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AND STRUGGLING TO GAIN THE MASTERY OVER HIS ENEMY
BOUNDING INTO FURZE BUSHES CHASING THE RABBITS INTO THEIR HOLES
THE MEN COULDN'T HAVE SHUT THEMSELVES IN THERE COURSE NOT MY LAD
YOU UNDERSTAND QUITE SIR THAT'S RIGHT
ME AND JEMMY DADD COME DOWN HERE ONCE AFTER BIRDS EGGS BEFORE FATHER HAD THE PLACE UP THERE QUITE BLOCKED UP
SO COME ON THEY STARTED AT ONCE AND AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES THEY WERE AT THE TOP OF A HILL BUT UPON GAZING ROUND THEY COULD ONLY DIMLY SEE OTHER HILLS SIMILAR TO THE ONE ON WHICH THEY STOOD,--REGULAR EARTH-WAVES OF THE GREAT CONVULSION WHICH HAD THROWN THE STRATA OF THE FREESTONE SHORE INTO A STATE OF CHAOS,--BUT NOTHING MORE
CONSEQUENTLY CUTLASSES WERE BEING FILED UP PISTOLS CAREFULLY EXAMINED AS TO THEIR FLINTS AND NICKED OFF TO SEE THAT THEY THREW A GOOD SHOWER OF SPARKS INTO THE PANS AND THE MEN SAT AND TALKED TOGETHER AS EAGERLY AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT PROCEEDING UPON A PLEASANT JAUNT INSTEAD OF UPON A RISKY EXPEDITION WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN DEATH TO SEVERAL AND CERTAINLY WOULD IN SERIOUS INJURY
WOULDN'T HAVE TROUBLED YOU SIR BUT SMUGGLERS IN SIGHT NO SIR
THE SMUGGLERS WOULD BE CAPTURED AND HE WOULD HAVE SUCH A REVENGE ON THAT BOY RAM
DON'T MATTER TO US LAD SO LONG AS THEY DIDN'T COME LAST NIGHT THEY MADE FAST THE HAWSER TO AN IRON STANCHION ONE OF SEVERAL DOTTED ABOUT AND PRETTY WELL HIDDEN BY THE WATER CLIMBED UP ON THE ROCK AND SAT DOWN IN THE WARM SUNSHINE TO WAIT FOR THE TURN OF THE TIDE WHILE AFTER A PULL IN ONE DIRECTION THE GIG'S COURSE WAS ALTERED AND THEY SAW ITS COURSE CHANGED AGAIN
BECAUSE IT'S OURS
ALL THE SAME THOUGH HE WAS WELL ENOUGH TRAINED IN HIS DUTIES TO MAKE HIM KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT ON EITHER SIDE AS THEY CREPT IN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOAT DID NOT SLIP AWAY UNDER THE CLIFFS TO RIGHT OR LEFT UNSEEN
AND HE BEGAN TO RUN OVER IN HIS MIND THE WHOLE OF THE INCIDENTS SINCE HE LANDED A FEW HOURS EARLIER
I DON'T WANT TO USE PISTOLS AND CUTLASHES TO ENGLISHMEN
I FEEL AS IF I HAD HIM FOR BOUT QUARTER HOUR I COULD KNOCK SOMETHING OUT OF HIM NONSENSE
CAN ANY ONE OF YOU MEN MILK SAID LIEUTENANT BROUGH A LITTLE PLUMP-LOOKING MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND THIRTY AS HE STOOD IN NAVAL UNIFORM STARING AT THE NEW ADDITION TO HIS MAJESTY'S CUTTER WHITE HAWK A WELL-FED DUN COW WHICH STOOD STEADILY SWINGING HER LONG TAIL TO AND FRO WHERE SHE WAS TETHERED TO THE BULWARKS AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO MAKE A MEAL OFF THE WELL HOLYSTONED DECK
THE DOOR WAS HE WELL KNEW FAST
I AREN'T COME BOUT NO BOYS THEN PRAY WHY HAVE YOU COME SEND THEM AWAY SAID THE MAN IN A HOARSE WHISPER
WHAT'S THAT CRIED THE LIEUTENANT AND AN ANSWER CAME FROM OUT OF THE BLACKNESS AHEAD
OH MR RAYSTOKE WHY AREN'T WE ABOARD AH WHY INDEED
YOU DID TELL ME
HERE MR GURR HELP MR RAYSTOKE AND--STOP THOUGH
THERE WAS NOTHING VISIBLE BUT SOFT GREEN ROLLING CLIFF TOP AND HE LOOKED VAINLY FOR SOME SIGN OF THE ENEMY EAGER TO GO ON BUT TAUGHT CAUTION AND NOT KNOWING BUT WHAT RAM MIGHT HAVE TAKEN ONE DIRECTION TO LURE THE PURSUERS AWAY WHILE THE MEN WERE IN HIDING IN ANOTHER
THAT'S RIGHT HE CONTINUED AS A MAN PRODUCED A PIECE OF LINE AND FIRMLY SECURED THE BOY WHO WAS LOWERED DOWN TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO HAD DESCENDED LAID ON THE STONES IN A CORNER AT THE BOTTOM
SOON AS YOU GOT ROUND INTO THE BAY SOME O THEM ASHORE WOULD SEE YER
DO LET ME STOP AND HAVE A GAME LET ME STOP AND TALK TO YOU THEN THERE WAS NO REPLY TO EITHER PROPOSAL AND JUST THEN THERE CAME A HOARSE RAM AHOY A-HOY CRIED THE LAD
WHAT SHOULD HE DO IF THE ROPE DID NOT PART
HAVEN'T FORGOT THE BASKET THIS TIME
IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW
THEN BY A DEXTEROUS EFFORT ARCHY SHOOK HIMSELF FAIRLY FREE
PRETTY SOON HOWEVER IT GETS SERIOUS AND WE MEET VARIOUS CHARACTERS LIVING NEARBY
I DID NOT COME TO FRIGHTEN YOU
AND BEGGIN YOUR PARDON SIR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND EASIN OFF THE DIRTY--DICK'S MUCH EASIER TO SAY OH VERY WELL DICK
AH RISDON AND LADY GRAEME HOW COULD YOU LET YOURSELF BE DRAGGED INTO THESE DREADFUL DEEDS DON'T BLAME ME HE SAID SADLY
ONLY ONE
THERE IT ALL WAS EXACTLY AS ARCHY HAD PICTURED IT IN HIS OWN MIND
RAM EXCLAIMED ARCHY AS THE BOY LOOKING HOT AND FIERCE WAS DRAGGED OUT BY THE MASTER TO STAND LOOKING ROUND HIM AS FIERCELY AS A WILD CAT
FOR HE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE WAS ROUGHLY DRESSED AS A SAILOR BOY AND HAD A RED WORSTED TASSELLED CAP WELL DRAWN-DOWN OVER HIS BESMIRCHED FACE
COURSE WE ARE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN THE HILL AGAIN
WHAT ARE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD ABOUT HE SAID SHARPLY TO DICK
DID YOU LOSE EM NO ROARED THE LIEUTENANT
GET ASHORE AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND FIND AND BRING BACK MR RAYSTOKE YES SIR CRIED THE MASTER AND HE WALKED OVER THE SIDE GLAD TO GET INTO THE BOAT AND PUSH OFF MUTTERING THE WHILE AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIM SUCH A QUIET AMIABLE LITTLE CHAP
DUNNO THOUGH
HOW WAS I TO KNOW IT WAS A ORSIFER IN THE DARK AND SMOTHERED UP LIKE THAT ARE YOU WOUNDED THEN CRIED THE MASTER EXCITEDLY
NO ONE COULD REGRET THIS MORE THAN I DO
DO YOU SURRENDER THERE WAS NOT A SOUND AND AFTER A MOMENTARY PAUSE THE MASTER SPAT IN HIS FIST GRIPPED HIS CUTLASS WENT DOWN ON ALL FOURS AFTER DRIVING HIS HAT ON TIGHTLY AND CRAWLED INTO THE HOLE FOLLOWED BY DICK
AND THEY KEPT ON ALWAYS CAUTIOUSLY IN DREAD AND YET IN HOPE THAT THEY MIGHT COME UPON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF WHICH WOULD SOLVE THEIR DIFFICULTY AT ONCE IF THEY COULD SEE THE CUTTER'S LIGHTS
I SHALL HAVE TO CRAWL
CALL ON THEM TO SURRENDER AGAIN AY TO BE SURE CRIED THE MASTER
HE CREPT TO IT GUIDED BY THE COLD AIR WHICH CAME IN AND HAD JUST REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD RAPID FOOTSTEPS AND SOME ONE PANTED WHERE'S THE SKIPPER HERE
HERE LASH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND TIE HIS LEGS TOGETHER
UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF HE HAD GRADUALLY FOUND HIS WAY TO THE PILE OF KEGS AND THESE HE TOUCHED THE NEXT MOMENT THINKING THAT AS HE STOOD FACING THEM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD FIRST COME TO HIMSELF MUST LIE OFF TO HIS LEFT
ARCHY FELT HIS HEART THROB AS HE LED THE WAY DOWN THE SLOPE EVERY STEP OF WHICH SEEMED SO FAMILIAR THAT HE ADVANCED WITHOUT HESITATION THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MANY STURDY MEN HE HAD AT HIS BACK KEEPING AWAY THE NATURAL SHRINKING WHICH UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE MIGHT HAVE FELT
BUT YOU'VE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE MASTER
HAVE A PUFF WILL YOU TAKE YOUR MISERABLE STUFF AWAY HAVE SOME CREAM-CHEESE AND NEW BREAD ARCHY MADE A BLOW AT HIM BUT RAM ONLY DREW BACK SLIGHTLY
YOUR LITTLE SWORD YES FATHER'S GOT IT ALL RIGHT
WHAT CAME UP
BUT JUST AS YOU LIKE COME ON DECK SAID THE LIEUTENANT
SUDDENLY HE STOPPED SHORT BY THE MASTER WHO HAD ALSO BEEN USING A GLASS AND WAS EVIDENTLY WAITING TO BE SPOKEN TO
I WANT TO BE A GOOD MATE TO EVERYBODY BUT THIS HERE'S A SHADE TOO MUCH AND I'D TAKE IT KINDLY MASTER RAYSTOKE SIR SAID THE MAN THE MIDSHIPMAN HAD GRIPPED IF NEX TIME SIR YOU WOULDN'T MIND GRAPPLING MY CLOTHES ONLY
BUT I'VE GOT YOU AND WON'T LET YOU GO I WAS DOING MY DUTY SIR AND I'M DOING MY DOOTY--WHAT FATHER TELLED ME HOW MUCH WILL YOU TAKE TO LET ME GO HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE SAID RAM GRINNING AND THE MIDSHIPMAN'S HEART MADE A BOUND
THEY'LL SEE ME I KNOW THEY'LL SEE ME THOUGHT ARCHY
AH WELL
BUT HIS VANITY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS LAST
FOR THE QUIET-LOOKING INOFFENSIVE BEAST WAS STANDING PERFECTLY STILL AGAIN BLINKING HER EYES AND CHEWING HER CUD BUT WRITHING AND TWISTING HER TAIL ABOUT AS IF IT WERE AN EEL AFTER AT DICK'S FIRST TOUCH RAISING ONE OF HER HIND LEGS AND SENDING THE PAIL FLYING ACROSS THE DECK AND THE WOULD-BE MILKER BACKWARDS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AND I'D LEAVE YOU THE LANTHORN IF YOU LIKE TO ASK ME I'M NOT GOING TO ASK FAVOURS OF SUCH A SET OF THIEVES AND SCOUNDRELS CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN PASSIONATELY
I WONDER WHETHER I COULD TRACK WHERE THEY WENT OUT NOT NOW HE SAID,--"NOT NOW AND WITH SOME FAINT HOPE OF FINDING THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN LYING ON THE OLD SAIL HE BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND LABORIOUSLY ALONG HIS MIND DRAGGED OVER AS IT WERE TO THE WORDS OF THE BOY AS HE TAUNTED HIM ABOUT MILK AND BREAD AND BUTTER WITH HAM
WILL YOU KEEP THAT RATTLE TONGUE OF YOURS QUIET
AND WITH THE ROPE HANGING LIKE A SWORD-BELT FROM HIS SHOULDER IMPEDING HIS MOVEMENTS AND GETTING CAUGHT IN THE PROJECTIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE ONCE MORE BEGAN TO DESCEND
LET'S TAKE DIFFICULTIES A BIT AT A TIME
ANSWER ME HONESTLY
GOOD DAY GENTLEMEN GOOD DAY HE WENT ON AFTER HIS HORSE CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF WHILE THE SEARCH PARTY MADE FOR THE TRACK TO GET BACK TO THE COVE AND ROW BACK
TRY AND HEAD HER IN UNDER THE CLIFF WHERE THERE'S NO WIND IF SHE TRIES TO PASS YOU
NEITHER OF THE PAIR SEEMED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM
IF HE COULD FIND ANY OF THESE HE MIGHT BE SAFE AND HE WAS ABOUT TO TRY AND SEARCH FOR SOME MEANS OF CONCEALMENT OR ESCAPE WHEN A COLD SHUDDER OF SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD RAN THROUGH HIM AND HE BEGAN TO RECALL ALL HE HAD READ OF HAUNTED HOUSES FOR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE DARKNESS IN FRONT OF HIM HE HEARD A LOW PITEOUS CRY
YAH
YAH
YAH
ARMED WITH THESE THE PARTY DESCENDED AND EXPLORED THE PLACE TO FIND THAT WHERE THE POWDER HAD EXPLODED THE WALLS WERE BLACKENED AND GRISLY AND THAT SCORES OF LITTLE BARREL STAVES WERE LYING ABOUT SHATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND PRETTY WELL BURNED AWAY
THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN THE PRISONER'S VOICE CAME AGAIN REPROACHFULLY
THIS WAS COMPARATIVELY EASY NOW AND IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO DAYS THE PRISONER HAD LOOSENED AND DRAWN OUT STONES TILL HE HAD MADE A WAY THROUGH A ROUGH PIECE OF WALL SIX FEET THICK AND HAD ENLARGED THE HOLE SO THAT THERE WAS ROOM TO CREEP INTO THE OPENING HE HAD MADE AND LOOK OUT
BUT I'D BE A BIT EASY WITH HIM SIR
DO YOU MEN MEAN TO SAY THAT NOT ONE AMONGST YOU CAN MILK CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
THEN A GIDDY FEELING OF DREAD CAME OVER HER AND SHE STOOD STARING BLANKLY AT THE FRANK-LOOKING BOY BEFORE HER
TWO OF EM'S DOWN BY THE COVE BUT THEY WON'T SEND ANYBODY FROM THE CUTTER TO-NIGHT NOT SO SURE OF IT MY BOY,--NOT SO SURE
HOWEVER SIR I'M NOT ON THAT SORT OF BUSINESS NOW CONTINUED GURR STERNLY
BE OFF SHAN'T JEMMY MILK THE COW AGAIN BEFORE WE GO SAID RAM WITH A GRIN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FRIENDLY OR MOCKING
MY DEAR ARCHY RAYSTOKE CRIED THE LIEUTENANT SEIZING HIS HANDS AND PUMPING THEM UP AND DOWN
I MUST LEAVE IT TO CHANCE HE SAID
NOW THEN THERE SHOUTED GURR RISING UP BUT RETAINING HIS HOLD OF THE TILLER WITH ONE HAND
MY FATHER'S
DUNNO LAD
THE EXPLANATION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING FOR TO HIS ASTONISHMENT THE RAY OF LIGHT GREW BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND BROADENED OUT FULL OF DANCING MOTES WHEN HE HAD BEEN AN HOUR AT WORK TEACHING HIM THAT HE HAD NOT DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM A GOOD NIGHT'S REST SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE HIM FOR THE TOIL TO COME
YOU WILL NOT TRY TO ESCAPE WILL YOU RAM NO
IT HAD BEEN DARK ENOUGH IN A DENSE FOG BUT IT DID NOT FEEL DARK AND COLD NOW AS IF THERE WAS A DENSE FOG
FOUND THE CARGO AND LEFT TWO MEN IN CHARGE EH NO SIR TUT--TUT--TUT
WE CAME AFTER OUR COW SIR PLEASE SAID THE LATTER LOOKING UP AT THE SAILOR WHO STOOD WITH A HAND UPON HIS ARM WHILE JEMMY DID THE SAME
HE SAW A BETTER WAY OUT NOW AND WAITING TILL HE FELT CONVINCED THAT THE BOY MUST BE WELL ON HIS WAY HOME HE JUMPED UP FELT HIS WAY TO THE CREVICE AND WAS SOON AFTER HARD AT WORK PICKING THE MORTAR FROM BETWEEN THE STONES
NOT ONE CRIED THE BOY WITH PERFECT TRUTH
I FEEL THAT I AM WORSE THAN HE
HAY WOMAN HAY HE ROARED
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT THERE ARE NO PUBLIC-HOUSES OUT IN THIS WILD PLACE MR GURR EH
SHACKLE WAS QUITE RIGHT
TEN GOLDEN POUNDS GONE OVER THE CLIFF THROUGH THAT BOY'S NEGLECT WELL NEVER MIND DEAR
YOU MUST GO AND FIND HIM
AREN'T AFRAID OF A DOG LIKE HIM
HER HEAD ACHED AND SHE FELT HALF STUNNED STILL BUT SHE STROVE TO RISE TO HER FEET AND SANK BACK WITH A MOAN OF PAIN
AND ANOTHER WAS BROUGHT TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND TAKING THE FIRST BUCKET AMIDST THE TITTERINGS OF THE MEN DICK SEATED HIMSELF LEANED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE COW'S SIDE PLACED THE VESSEL BETWEEN HIS LEGS AND BEGAN TO OPERATE IN TRUE DAIRYMAN STYLE UPON THE COW
HE WAS ONCE MORE ASCENDING THE SLOPE TOWARD THE PATCH OF WOODLAND HIGH UP THE HILL AND THE PLACE OF DEPOSIT OF THE SMUGGLED GOODS MUST BE THE HOZE
HIS MEMORY BEGAN TO WORK AGAIN IN HIS BACK FOR HE GRADUALLY BECAME CONSCIOUS OF FEELING SOMETHING THERE AND AFTER SUFFERING THE INCONVENIENCE FOR A LONG TIME HE THRUST HIS HAND UNDER HIS SPINE AND DREW OUT A PIECE OF IRON SHARP-EDGED AND ROUND LIKE A HOOP
AND AS HE ROVED ABOUT THE QUARRY HIS BUSY FINGERS TOUCHED PACKAGES AND BALES
SIR RISDON GRAEME'S
GRIP WAS AN INTELLIGENT DOG IN HIS WAY BUT NOTHING WOULD MAKE HIM LEAVE HIS MISTRESS THERE
THE MORNING WAS GLORIOUS AND THE SEA OF A LOVELY AMETHYST BLUE AS CELIA WANDERED ON AND ON TOWARD THE HIGHEST OF THE HILLS AWAY WEST OF THE HOZE
ARE THERE ANY MORE OF EM YES I'LL BE BOUND THERE ARE
HE WAS THINKING HOW HORRIBLY DARK AND MISERABLE THE OLD QUARRY MUST BE FOR THE FIRST TIME
`VERY TRUE OF COURSE WHAT I SAY IS VERY TRUE
I MIGHT SUSPECT BUT I WOULD NEVER SATISFY MYSELF BY WATCHING
FATHER WON'T LET YOU GO
BUT NEVER NO MORE
BUT HERE RIGHT AT HER FEET THE DOG BEGAN TO SCRATCH TOSSING ONE THIN PIECE OF STONE OVER THE OTHERS UPON WHICH IT LAY
INTO THESE HE GLANCED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE ALL FITTED WITH THICK CANDLES BEFORE PASSING A PIECE OF ROPE THROUGH THE RINGS AT THE TOP
I HOPE THERE WON'T BE NO TROUBLE BOY SHE STOOD WIPING HER DRY HANDS UPON HER APRON AND GAZED THOUGHTFULLY WITH WRINKLED BROW STRAIGHT BEFORE HER FOR A MINUTE AS IF CONJURING UP OLD SCENES
SHE TAPPED WITH HER KNUCKLES AND THE SOUND INDICATED THAT THE PLACE WAS FULL FOR ALL WAS DULL AND HEAVY AND NO REVERBERATION IN THE PLACE
BUT THIS WAS NO NOVELTY TO THE MEN AND THE BOATS SPED ON ONE IN THE OTHER'S WAKE WITH THE CREW STRAINING THEIR HEADS OVER THEIR LEFT SHOULDERS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE NEXT FLASH WHICH PRECEDED THE GUN
OH WHAT A COWARD I AM HE SAID SOFTLY
HE GLANCED OVER THE SIDE TO SEE THAT THE BOATS WERE IN READINESS AND THEN WENT AFT WITHOUT A SOUND TILL ALL AT ONCE HE KICKED AGAINST SOMETHING IN THE DARKNESS BENEATH THE LARBOARD BULWARK TO WHICH HE HAD CROSSED AND NEARLY FELL HEADLONG
OH I CAN QUITE PLAIN SAID JEMMY
BUT SHE WORKED OUT A NICE LITTLE SPEECH IN WHICH SHE WOULD TELL THE CUTTER'S OFFICER THAT HER FATHER HAD ONCE BEEN RICH BUT HE HAD ESPOUSED THE YOUNG PRETENDER'S CAUSE AND THE RESULT HAD BEEN THAT HE HAD BECOME SO IMPOVERISHED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A TIME WHEN THEY HAD HAD HARDLY ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM AND THE OLD MAID-SERVANT WHO STILL CLUNG TO THEIR FALLEN FORTUNES
I'LL BRING YOU ONE O MINE NEXT TIME I COME
YOU KNOW WHAT A LOT OF MONEY TEN GUINEAS WOULD BE YES SAID RAM GRINNING
AND I MEANT TO SAVE THEM FROM TROUBLE IF I COULD OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEM ALL AND DID NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH PEOPLE COULD STOOP TO BE MIXED UP WITH ROGUES AND SMUGGLERS
I WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED AT LOSING THE LUGGER AND I MADE A HARD FIGHT FOR IT BUT YOUR NEWS--MY DEAR BOY--MY DEAR MR GURR THIS IS SPLENDID
I'VE BROUGHT YOU A JEW'S HARP TO LEARN TO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE ALONE ARCHY UTTERED AN EJACULATION FULL OF CONTEMPT AND SNATCHED THE PROFFERED TOY AND HURLED IT AS FAR AS HE COULD
GET ALL BACK IN QUICK AS HE FINISHED SPEAKING ARCHY COULD HEAR THE DULL SOFT STEPS OF LADEN MEN RETURNING AND MORE AND MORE KEPT COMING AND IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE QUICKLY AND SILENTLY REPLACING THE KEGS THEY HAD BEEN CARRYING DOWN HILL TO WHERE TUMBRILS WERE WAITING FOR A LOAD
WE SHALL COME UP TO YOU AT THE LEAST SOUND TO HELP THE MEN UTTERED A LOW AY AY SIR SPEAKING AS IF THEY WERE OPPRESSED BY THE DARKNESS AND THE MASTER WHISPERED
AND THE MIDSHIPMAN JUST HAD TIME TO DART FORWARD HIS HAND CATCH HIM BY THE SHOULDER AND DRAG HIM BACK OR HE WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE ROCK
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO HE SHOUTED AFTER A VAIN STRUGGLE TO FREE HIMSELF AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED MUFFLED AND THICK THROUGH THE HEAVY SACK
THIS EVEN IF THE SHELF HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN OCCUPIED
YOU'RE TIDY STRONG NOW AND I CAN'T `ANSWER FOR MY FLESH IF YOU TAKE HOLD LIKE THAT HUSH
FIND YOUR LITTLE BARRELS COME ABOARD MY LADS CONTINUED THE LIEUTENANT WITHOUT REPLYING TO THE QUESTION
WHY YOU PUP
I SAY MISS CELIA HE CRIED
NOW MY MAN BROUGHT NEWS OF HIM CRIED THE LIEUTENANT EAGERLY
HE LAY STILL NOT THINKING BUT TRYING TO THINK FOR HIS MIND WAS IN THE CONDITION DESCRIBED BY THE LITTLE GIRL WHO SUFFERING FROM A COLD SAID PLEASE MA ONE SIDE OF MY NOSE WON'T GO ARCHY RAYSTOKE'S MIND WOULD NOT GO AND FOR A LONG TIME HE LAY MOTIONLESS
THAT WILL NOT DO
D'YE HEAR
GOOD-BYE ARCHY LEAPED UP AND STOOD LISTENING WITH HIS HEART BEATING FAST AND HIS HEAD BENT IN THE DIRECTION TAKEN BY THE BOY
THERE WAS A CRY A JERK AND THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS DOWN ON HIS CHEST AS HE HAD FALLEN CLINGING TO THE EDGE FOR THE YOUNG SMUGGLER SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SNATCHED FROM HIS ARMS AND WAS NOW LYING THIRTY FEET BELOW ON THE EDGE OF A SLOPING ROCK PART OF HIS BODY WITHOUT SUPPORT AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO GLIDE OFF INTO THE WAVES BELOW
ALMOST AS HE REACHED THE FARTHER SIDE THE MEN CAME LEAPING AND YELLING AFTER HIM TO STAND BEATING THE TONGUES OF FIRE FROM THEIR FEET AND LEGS
WHERE'S YOUR FINE CLOTHES AND YOUR SWORD
AND WE SENT YOU EVERYTHING WE COULD TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE
WHY HE MUST HAVE A LUGGER OF HIS OWN AND KEEP HIS STORES IN HERE A LITTLE FEELING ABOUT CONVINCED HIM THAT THE WINDOW OF THE VAULT COULD NOT BE BEHIND THE PILE OF BOAT-GEAR AGAINST WHICH HE HAD STUMBLED AND HE MOVED SLOWLY OF
I COULD HARDLY BREATHE WELL GO STEADY THEN
HE WISHED HE HAD NOT MADE THE DISCOVERY NOW AND FELT READY TO RETREAT FOR IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE TO HAVE TO TELL THE LIEUTENANT GIVING HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS WOULD LEAD TO THE ARREST OF THE TALL CAREWORN MAN WHO HAD IMPRESSED HIM SO STRANGELY THAT DAY
I KNOW BETTER THAN THAT
THAT WILL DO BUT YOU MUST SAY `SIR OR `AY AY SIR AY AY SIR WELL YOU SEEM TO BE SETTLING DOWN VERY SOON OH YES I'M ALL RIGHT
BUT LOOK HERE RAM HOW COULD YOUR FATHER MAKE SIR RISDON WHO IS A GENTLEMAN LEND HIM THE CELLAR CAUSE FATHER AND MOTHER USED TO PRETTY WELL KEEP EM
OH I SEE
HERE WHAT MADE YOU DRESS UP LIKE THAT YOU'RE MISTAKEN SAID ARCHY GRUFFLY AS HE MADE A FEEBLE STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP THE CHARACTER HE HAD ASSUMED
WIFE HE SAID IN A DEEP HUSKY VOICE I NEVER FELT THE MISERY AND DEGRADATION OF MY POSITION SO CRUELLY BEFORE
THERE WAS NO BOAT AND THEY SEARCHED ALONG SOME DISTANCE EAST TURNED BACK TO THE LEDGE AND WENT WEST STILL WITHOUT ELUCIDATION OF THE MYSTERY
THE MEN RESPONDED WITH ANOTHER CHEER AND THE WATER RATTLED UNDER THEIR BOWS
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT SHE STIRRED FAR FROM THE GLOOMY FIR-WOOD AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE FOR HER LIFE HAD NOT BEEN THAT OF MOST YOUNG PEOPLE OF HER AGE
ON'Y A BIT SORE YOU TUMBLED OFF THE CLIFF DIDN'T YOU OFF A BIT OF IT SAID RAM GRINNING
NO SOONER HAD HE PASSED ROUND THE RACE THAN LIGHTS HAD BEEN SHOWN AND THE LUGGER WAS RUN IN
AT LAST HIS MIND BEGAN TO CLEAR AND HE SET HIMSELF TO WONDER WITH MORE FORCE
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SUCH A BLIND IDIOTIC BABY HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS THOUGH THAT THE TRICK IF SUCH IT PROVED TO BE HAD BEEN WELL PLANNED AND EXECUTED AND THE STIPULATION OF THE MAN THAT HE SHOULD BE PAID FIFTY POUNDS IF THE BOAT WAS CAPTURED HAD COMPLETELY THROWN DUST INTO HIS EYES
FOLLOW ME HURRAH YELLED THE MEN AND THE LAD HAD TAKEN A DOZEN STEPS TOWARD THE POOL OF FIRE WHEN A WILD SHOUT CAME FROM NEAR THE ENTRANCE
COOM COOM
OH WHAT AN OBSTINATE CHAP YOU ARE JEMMY
HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
THE ROPE LAY SIMPLY ON THE TURF AND THE MAN WHO WATCHED OVER THE DESCENT MERELY PLACED HIS BOOT OVER IT THE HOLLOW BETWEEN SOLE AND HEEL AFFORDING ROOM FOR THE ROPE TO RUN AND A LITTLE EXTRA PRESSURE STOPPING ITS WAY
STUPID IDIOT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
AND THE MEN LAY DOWN FORMING THEMSELVES INTO A HUMAN CHAIN THE END OF WHICH DICK WAS LOWERED SLOWLY DOWN THE SLOPE AND OVER THE EDGE
ALL RIGHT THAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR MRS SHACKLE WHO HAD SOME BUTTER TO MAKE
LANDING A CARGO'S ONE THING
HENCE THE PRISONER FELT THAT IF HE KNOCKED DOWN AND STUNNED THE FRANK GOOD-TEMPERED BOY WHO SEEMED DISPOSED TO BE THE BEST OF FRIENDS IN EVERY WAY BUT THAT OF HELPING HIM TO ESCAPE HE WOULD BE NO NEARER FREEDOM THAN BEFORE
AND MASTER SHACKLE WOULDN'T LET YOUNG RAM HERE GO ALONG THESE HERE CLIFT SLOPES WITHOUT ME TO TAKE CARE ON HIM RAM GRINNED
BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY COMING NEARER AND AS IT APPROACHED HE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS IN A VAST CAVERNOUS FLAT-CEILED PLACE WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A QUARRY FROM WHICH MASSES OF STONE HAD BEEN HEWN THE FLOOR HERE AND THERE BEING LITTERED WITH REFUSE OF ALL SORTS AND SIZES
OH ALL RIGHT THEN DID YOU THINK YOU'D GET OUT THAT WAY YOUNGSTER SAID SHACKLE AS THE MIDSHIPMAN STOOD ERECT AT THE TOP OF THE ROUGH STAIRS
SAID PLUM PUFFS TAKE EM AWAY THEN
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT MR RAYSTOKE SAID THE MASTER
RAM FOLLOWED AND TOOK ONE OF THE OARS SETTLED DOWN BEHIND JEMMY AND THE NEXT MINUTE WITH THE WHOLE CREW OF THE CUTTER STANDING GRINNING AT THE SIDE THEY BEGAN TO ROW SHOREWARD
A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS THEN UTTERLY WEARIED OUT WITH HIS LONG AND ARDUOUS TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TASK BEGINNING WITH HIS WATCH ON THE CUTTER'S DECK HE FELT HIS WAY TO THE BIG CHAIR OPPOSITE TO THE WINDOW TO REST HIS LEGS AND TRY AND THINK OUT SOME PLAN
STICKS JEMMY THERE FATHER
I WAS REGULARLY IN DESPAIR AS I WAS BEING TAKEN FROM ONE PRISON TO BE SHUT UP IN ANOTHER WHEN I RAN UP AGAINST YOU
YOU--YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEARCH HE SAID HESITATINGLY
A SMALL BAG OF STONES WAS THEN ATTACHED TO THE LOOP THE WHEEL SPUN ROUND AND THE BAG WENT WHIZZING DOWN WHILE THE GROUP OF MEN STOOD WAITING AND WAITING FOR THEY COULD SEE NOTHING BELOW HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER SO DENSE WAS THE MIST NOW
YOUR CELLARS ARE QUITE EMPTY I S'POSE THE LAST REMARK CAME SO QUICKLY THAT THE HEARER STARTED AND MADE NO REPLY
AS HE CREPT ON QUIETLY HE GLANCED OVER HIS SHOULDER ONCE SAW THE LIGHT DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE GREAT SQUARE SQUAT PILLARS AND THEN WITH A FEELING OF TRIUMPH THAT THRILLED THROUGH HIM HE WENT CAUTIOUSLY UP THE REST OF THE SLOPE HIS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED HIS BREATH HELD AND IN MOMENTARY EXPECTATION OF HEARING AN EXCLAMATION FROM THE OTHER END OF THE CAVE
HIS MAJESTY'S BOATS ARE WANTED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAN RUNNING TO AND FRO TO FETCH HIM ABOARD
AND HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD WHERE VERY FAINTLY AS IF FAR DISTANT HE HEARD THE RUSTLING SOUND AGAIN
THEY DARED NOT TRY THAT AND ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW IS TO ESCAPE IF MR BROUGH DOES NOT SEND THE LADS TO FETCH ME OUT HE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE TIME NOW SINCE HIS LANDING
NOW RAM SAID HIS FATHER READY YES FATHER SAID THE BOY AFTER GETTING HIS MOUTH INTO TALKING TRIM
THE MEN TRAMPED ON EXCITING THE INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGES THAT WERE PASSED--CLUSTERS OF WHITE ROUGH STONE HOUSES BY THE ROADSIDE WHOSE OCCUPANTS LOOKED INNOCENCE ITSELF BUT THERE WAS HARDLY ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD NOT HAVE TOLD TALES ABOUT BUSY WORK ON DARK NIGHTS CARRYING KEGS AND BALES OR PACKAGES OF TOBACCO FROM THE CLIFF TO SOME HIDING-PLACE IN BARN OR CAVE
WONDER WHETHER YOU THINK I AM GOING TO FALL AND LET YOU HAVE A PICK AT ME SAID ARCHY WITH A FORCED LAUGH
BUT THOUGH HE LISTENED AGAIN AND AGAIN HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH A SOUND
THIS EVENING MY LAD AT DUSK
THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY GURR WHO SUDDENLY ROARED OUT AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST GRASPED THE POSITION WHY THEY'VE GOT AWAY EVERY MAN JACK OF EM SIR AND THEY ALL WALKED OVER ME AND THEY'VE SHUT US IN YES MR GURR SAID ARCHY SADLY
SEEMED ALL GRUMPY AND WOULDN'T ANSWER A CIVIL QUESTION SHOULD HA KICKED HIM SAID JEMMY
AFTER THAT I SHALL RUN IN AND WE'LL CREEP ALONG UNDER THE LAND
THE DOOR WOULD BE OPEN HE THOUGHT
I SHOULD HAVE BEHAVED LIKE WHAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE CALLED--A GENTLEMAN AND MAKE OUR FORTUNES TEN TIMES WORSE
DON'T PLAY TRICKS LAD
IF YOU DO NOT SHOW ME THE WAY OUT I'LL SHOUT FOR HELP AND WHEN IT DOES COME I'LL TAKE CARE YOUR PUNISHMENT SHALL BE TEN TIMES WORSE AH DO SAID RAM LAUGHING
VERY GLAD INDEED
WELL WE MUST DO THE BEST WE CAN
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
HE SOON CAST THAT OFF THOUGH FOR IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL LOW SPIRITED IN THE FACE OF SUCH A DISCOVERY AND BEFORE COMMENCING THE TASK HE HAD IN HAND HE KNELT DOWN WITH HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE CHINK TO DRINK IN THE DELICIOUS SEA AIR
UPON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING GRIP HAD VANQUISHED HER
NOW THEN LET'S GO BACK YOU CAN GO SAID ARCHY COLDLY
BUT I DON'T RECOLLECT SEEING THIS GRASS IN THE MORNING HE THOUGHT
AND PARADOXICALLY AS HE GREW BETTER HE GREW WORSE THE PAIN IN THE HEAD BEING CONDENSED IN A MORE CENTRAL REGION WHERE NATURE CARRIES ON A KIND OF FACTORY OF BONE MUSCLE FLESH BLOOD AND GENERALLY HEALTH AND STRENGTH
HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT AS RAM HELD UP THE LIGHT ARCHY'S COUNTENANCE TOLD TALES OF THE PASSION STRUGGLING IN HIS BREAST FOR EXIT AND THE BOY GRINNED
GET OUT OR I'LL JUMP ON YOU--D'YE HEAR SAID RAM FIERCELY
YOUR LADS WILL BE AS PLEASED AS CAN BE WITH A MUG OF MY HOME-BREWED AS HE LED THE WAY TO THE DOOR THE MIDSHIPMAN GAVE ANOTHER GLANCE ROUND SEEING NOTHING IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE SUSPICIOUS AND A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE WHOLE PARTY WAS BEING REFRESHED BOTH OFFICERS QUITE CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING CONTRABAND ON THE PREMISES
WISH I HAD I DARE SAY YOU DO SIR
GURR HE WHISPERED DON'T SAY A WORD TO MR BROUGH
CAN'T GET NO FARTHER
LIGHT OUT ARCHY'S HEART BEAT HEAVILY AND HE FELT THAT TO ESCAPE HE OUGHT TO TRY AND IMITATE THE BOY'S VOICE AND SAY YES BUT HE COULD NOT ONLY STAND PANTING AND THE NEXT INSTANT HIS OPPORTUNITY IF OPPORTUNITY IT WAS HAD GONE
AND A HALT WAS CALLED DURING WHICH THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT WIPED HIS STREAMING FACE AND RECOVERED HIS BREATH
HERE ONE OF YOU RELOAD THAT
YOU AREN'T ASLEEP
WASHES MYSELF DEAL MORE THAN SOME O MY MATES AS CALLS ME DIRTY
GET BACK INTO YOUR BOAT SAID THE LITTLE OFFICER SHARPLY
BUT SHE WASN'T DROWNED LOOK HERE BOY
FOUR MORE VISITS WERE PAID HIM BY RAM BUT WHETHER THEY WERE AT INTERVALS OF DAYS OR HALF DAYS THE PRISONER COULD NOT TELL FOR ANY QUESTIONS HE ASKED WERE LAUGHINGLY EVADED AND ALL ATTEMPTS AT PERSUASION AND BRIBERY PROVED USELESS
I KNOW YOU--THE YOUNG--YES MISS GRAEME YES SHE CRIED HASTILY
BUT THERE WERE DRAWBACKS TO SUCH A PROCEEDING
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT BEFORE I HALF KILL YOU HAVE A PUFF TAKE THEM AWAY YOU THIEVING SCOUNDREL CRIED ARCHY WHO WAS HALF MAD WITH DISAPPOINTMENT
WHERE DID THEY MEAN TO TAKE YOU LAD I DON'T KNOW
AND I SAY ARE YOU GOING UP TO THE HOZE YES
I DID GET HOT THAT DAY CARRYING OF EM UP THE HILL
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TELLING ON HER HE GROWLED TO HIMSELF AS HE LAY BACK WITH HIS HANDS UNDER HIS HEAD
SPOSE I'M AS STRONG AS ANY ON EM
ALL THESE THINGS OCCUPIED HIS MIND A LITTLE AND WHEN HE WAS EXTRA DULL HE WOULD GO AND LIE DOWN BY THE HOLE WHICH ADMITTED THE SALT SEA AIR OR ELSE MAKE HIS WAY RIGHT UNDER THE TRAP-DOOR AND CLIMB UP TO IT AND SIT AND LISTEN FOR THE COMING OF RAM
MORE THAN SATISFIED
AND THE BOATSWAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD DECISIVELY
FOR WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO HER
GET UP YOUR ANCHOR AND MAKE SAIL
HOW VEXATIOUS HE CRIED TO HIMSELF AS HE PANTED ON ALONE ALWAYS IN DREAD OF COMING SUDDENLY UPON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF AND TREMBLING LEST IN THEIR EXCITEMENT THE MEN MIGHT GO OVER
HE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT
THAT'S ALL BUT I SHALL BE AS GUILTY AS YOU GUILTY THE MAN LAUGHED
P'R'APS HE'D LIKE A MUG OF OUR MEAD BEFORE HE GOES AND HIS MEN A DROP OF HOME-BREWED AY TO BE SURE CRIED SHACKLE
HE FUN IT SAID THE MAN BUT IT WERE IN A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE
AS HE STOOD ON THE HIGHEST PART OF THIS PILE OF STONE HE HESITATED ABOUT GOING FARTHER AND BORE OFF TO HIS LEFT FEELING THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH HAD NOT COME SO FAR
AND ACCEPTING HIS POSITION HE SUDDENLY GAVE THE ORDER FOR FOUR MEN TO GO INTO EACH BOAT AND BEGIN TO TOW THE CUTTER WHILE A FEW OF THE CREW PUT OUT THE SWEEPS TO GET HER A LITTLE FARTHER FROM THE CLIFF TO CATCH THE BREEZE
BLOWS FELL THICK AND FAST CUDGEL STRIKING HEAD CUTLASS SHOULDER ANYTHING THAT OPPOSED THE ADVANCE
THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SEASON OF DOUBT--AND THEN OF ASSURANCE--ANOTHER OF DOUBT TILL THE POOR LITTLE FELLOW GREW HALF BEWILDERED AND GAZED AROUND LONGING FOR THE DAYLIGHT AND HIS OLD MOORINGS SO THAT HE MIGHT SEND A BOAT ASHORE AND CAREFULLY EXAMINE THE GROUND TO SEE IF HE COULD TRACE ANY SIGNS OF LANDING HAVING GONE ON
HE FELT AS CERTAIN AS IF HE HAD SEEN EVERYTHING AND HE GROUND HIS TEETH WITH VEXATION
CAN SHE HAVE SLIPPED ASIDE AND LET US PASS NO SAID ONE OF THE OTHER MEN
NOW THEN WHAT I WANT IS A GOOD MARLINSPIKE OR AN IRON BAR
OH DEAR ME WHAT'S MATTER SIR MATTER DIRTY DICK
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE
WE SHALL SEE
MR RAYSTOKE SIR
DICK TAKE COMMAND
PULL MY LADS PULL THE SMUGGLERS BOAT WAS NOW ABOUT HALF A MILE AWAY THE MEN IN HER PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT BUT THE KING'S BOAT WAS THE MORE SWIFT THOUGH AFTER A FEW MINUTES CHASE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE START WAS IN THE SMUGGLERS FAVOUR
THE SAILOR CHUCKLED
GOOD DEEP WATER FOR FIVE-AND-TWENTY MILES THERE CLOSE UNDER THE CLIFF THEN YOU ARE MAKING FOR CLAYBLACK BAY AH YOU'LL SEE SAID THE MAN SURLILY
BUT LOOK HERE MY GOOD WOMAN
NO I WON'T TRY IT AGAIN
AND HAVING NO DIFFICULTY IN FOLLOWING UNDER A LOW ARCHWAY FOR SOME TWENTY YARDS,--A PASSAGE EVIDENTLY ONLY POSSIBLE AT EXTREME LOW WATER,--AND DIRECTLY AFTER THEY WERE OUT AGAIN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND AT THE BOTTOM OF A HUGE FUNNEL-LIKE HOLLOW FROM WHICH THE ROCKY CLIFFS ROSE UP SOME THREE HUNDRED FEET
THOUGHT I--I MEAN HIM--WAS TO GET FIFTY POUNDS IF YOU TOOK THE BOAT YES WELL YOU MUST TAKE HER
TAKE JEMMY DADD AND THE BOAT AND FIND HER
COULDN'T HAVE GOT AWAY IF I WANTED TO HE SAID LAUGHING FRANKLY IN ARCHY'S FACE
WE WANT TO FIND MR RAYSTOKE THE MEN CLOSED UP TOGETHER AND MASTERED THEIR DESIRE TO GO HUNTING TO MAKE A CHANGE FROM THE SALT BEEF AND PORK FARE AND SOON AFTER THEY CAME SUDDENLY UPON SIR RISDON AND HIS LADY THE LATTER WHO LOOKED WEAK AND ILL LEANING ON HER HUSBAND'S ARM
THERE WAS NO REPLY THE MEN GRINNING ONE AT THE OTHER ON HEARING SO NOVEL A QUESTION
WHAT A FUSS PEOPLE DO MAKE ABOUT A BIT O SMUGGLING
YOU KICKED THE LAST OVER AND THOUGHT YOU'D GET OUT IN THE DARK
WE COULD DO NO GOOD NOW SAID ARCHY FOR OF COURSE I AM NOT SURE WHERE THE ENTRANCE IS MUST BE GETTING TOWARD MORNING TOO AND TIME TO BE ABOARD MR RAYSTOKE
IF HE'D TRIED TO BITE ME I'D HAVE KICKED HIM INTO THE BACK-GARDEN YOU WOULD NOT DARE TO CRIED THE GIRL INDIGNANTLY
I D'KNOW
KEEP YOUR CHEERING TILL YOU'VE TAKEN THE BOAT A LOW MURMUR RAN ROUND THE SIDE OF THE CUTTER AND EVERY EYE WAS STRAINED AS THE LITTLE OFFICER WHISPERED A CROWN FOR THE FIRST MAN WHO SIGHTS HER AFTER A WHILE THE LIEUTENANT MENTALLY SAID I WISH MR RAYSTOKE WAS HERE HE AND GURR COULD GO IN THE OTHER BOAT
OH WHAT A CHANCE TO GET THEM ABOARD IN IRONS AND UNDER HATCHES FOR THEM TO HAVE A TASTE OF WHAT THEY GAVE ME IT SEEMED PERFECTLY REASONABLE THAT THOSE TWO SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF SOMEWHERE IN A BOAT AND WERE NOW RETURNING
THE BOY WAS EITHER DEAD OR COMPLETELY STUNNED BY HIS FALL
HE FELT VEXED AND CALLED IT LAZINESS WORKING THE HARDER TO RECOVER LOST TIME AND AS THE HOURS GLIDED BY LISTENING INTENTLY FOR THE SLIGHTEST SOUND FROM THE QUARRY BELOW THAT SHOULD INDICATE THE COMING OF RAM WITH HIS DAILY PORTION OF FOOD
AHOY YOURSELF CRIED A VOICE FROM OFF THE SEA ON THE SHORE SIDE AND ALL TURNED TO SEE A BOAT APPROACHING ROWED BY A ROUGH-LOOKING FISHERMAN AND WITH A LAD OF ABOUT SIXTEEN SITTING ASTERN WHO NOW ROSE UP TO ANSWER THE MAN WHO SHOUTED
HI DICK
THEY'VE PICKED UP A BRANDY KEG THERE WAS NO DENYING THE FACT
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING
ARCHY'S FIRST IDEA WAS TO GO AND MEET THE BEARERS OF THE LIGHT BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE DECIDED TO STAND UPON HIS DIGNITY AND LET THEM COME TO HIM AND AS THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE VISIT MIGHT BE OF AN INIMICAL NATURE HIS HAND STOLE INTO HIS BREAST IN SEARCH OF HIS DIRK
YES RAM YOU LIKE GRIP DON'T YOU YES OF COURSE THEN I WON'T NEVER KICK HIM MISS
LOBSTER I SHOULD SAY LOOKS FAST AND SMART FOR A LOBSTER-BOAT THOUGHT ARCHY AS HE KEPT GLANCING AT THE CRAFT WHOSE ASPECT SEEMED TO HAVE A STRANGE ATTRACTION FOR HIM ALONE
LOOK AT THAT HE HAD CLIMBED UP THE ZIGZAG TRACK ANOTHER FIFTY FEET AND STOPPED SHORT TO GAZE AWAY AT THE BRIGHT STARS OF THE CLEAR NIGHT WITH THE GREAT LAYER OF FOG ALL BELOW HIM NOW
I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP YOU PRISONERS BUT THE EYE OF THE LAW IS UPON YOU AND THIS SMUGGLING WILL BE BROUGHT HOME TO YOU BOTH
THE BLACK DARKNESS OF THE GREAT CAVERN QUARRY WAS ALL ALIGHT NOW WITH THE PICTURES HIS MIND PAINTED AND IN HIS DELIGHT AND SATISFACTION HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE THOUGHT OF RAM'S DISAPPOINTMENT ON COMING ONE DAY AND FINDING HIS PRISONER FLOWN
HE WAS VERY KIND TO ME WHEN I WAS A PRISONER HUM
LIEUTENANT BROUGH WAS OUT FOR A LONG WALK
LOBSTER-BOAT SIR SAID GURR AS ARCHY CAME BEHIND THEM
I FEEL JUST AS MUCH LOST AS I DID IN THE DARK IN THAT CAVE MR GURR HE SAID
SARCH AWAY SQUIRE SAID SHACKLE BLUFFLY AS HE PLACED THE MUGS ON THE FLOOR AND TURNED THE WOODEN SPIGOTS
YOU MEANT THAT YOU WERE GETTING UNEASY ABOUT MR RAYSTOKE'S PROLONGED ABSENCE YES SIR THAT'S IT SAID DICK EAGERLY
YES THEY WOULD FOR IF THEY WERE GOING TO SET HIM FREE THEY WOULD DO SO IN A WAY THAT WOULD PLACE IT BEYOND HIS POWER TO BETRAY THEIR SECRET STORE
UP AT THE FARM AND YOUR FATHER OH HE WENT OFF IN THE LUGGER THIS MORNING AFTER THEY'D TRIED TO RUN A CARGO
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE SPEED WAS CONSIDERABLY CHECKED BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE ALONG AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE LAND AND WITHOUT DOUBT INVISIBLE TO ANY VESSEL AT SEA
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO
WANTS TO BE FRIENDS
WHAT WERE THEY GOING TO DO WITH YOU DON'T YOU KNOW ME MR GURR MR RAYSTOKE THE REST OF HIS SPEECH IF HE SAID ANYTHING WAS DROWNED IN A HEARTY CHEER AS THE MEN PRESSED ROUND
THERE WAS NOT A SOUND TO SUGGEST THAT HIS ORDERS WERE HEARD
THE PIECE HE HELD WAS ABOUT A POUND WEIGHT AND DRAWING BACK HIS HAND AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH HE THREW IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO START BACK IN ALARM FOR IT STRUCK WOOD WITH A HEAVY THUD AND DROPPED DOWN ALMOST AT HIS FEET
WE'LL FIND IT
AND AS THE DRIPPING LITTLE BARREL WAS PLACED BY ONE OF THE MEN IN THE FORE PART OF THE GIG THE OTHERS GAVE WAY AND THE LIGHT VESSEL CAME RAPIDLY NOW TOWARD THE LEDGE
HE HAD BETTER NOT TRY MEANWHILE RAM WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY AND SENDING LITTLE AMBASSADORS DOWN BEFORE HIM IN THE SHAPE OF PIECES OF ROCK AND SHALE ALL OF WHICH ARRIVED AT THE LEDGE IN A VERY INIMICAL WAY BOUNDING OFF SCATTERING IN FRAGMENTS OR FALLING WITH A HEAVY THUD
I HOPE WE SHALL NOT BE RUDE TO ANY ONE HE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR AFTER SALUTING MRS SHACKLE THE FARMER LEADING THE WAY AND POINTING OUT THE NEAREST PATH UP THE STEEP SLOPE
YOU TWO STOP AND GUARD THOSE PRISONERS THE SAILORS STEPPED BACK INTO THE BOAT AND RESUMED THEIR OARS TO ROW STEADILY EAST FOR ABOUT HALF A MILE PAST SEVERAL SHALLOW CAVES BUT THEY COULD NOT SEE ONE LIKELY TO BECOME A HIDING-PLACE FOR SMUGGLED GOODS AND THE ROCK ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER ABOVE THEIR HEADS PRECLUDING ALL ASCENT
IT WAS AS BLACK NOW AS IT WAS IN THE DEEPEST PART OF THE ANCIENT QUARRY BUT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO MATTER FOR IT WAS ONLY THE DARKNESS OF EVENING AND IF HE WAITED THERE AND KEPT ON WORKING HE WOULD SEE FIRST OF ALL A LONG PALLID RAY THAT WOULD GROW BRIGHTER AND BRING AS IT WERE SOME LIGHT AND HOPE WHILE AS SOON AS HE COULD GET OUT A STONE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE SEA PERHAPS EVEN MAKE OUT THE CUTTER AND SIGNAL
WHAT YER GROWLING ABOUT THE DOG DIDN'T SAY BUT GROWLED MORE FIERCELY
ALL AT ONCE GURR CAME TO A DEAD STOP
HE WAS APPARENTLY COOL ENOUGH BUT HIS PULSES BEAT MORE RAPIDLY THAN WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXERTION THROUGH WHICH HE HAD GONE AND BEING AFTER A FEW MINUTES EAGER NOW TO GET HIS TASK AT AN END HE TRIED TO THE LEFT TO FIND NO WAY UP THERE TO THE RIGHT BUT EVERYWHERE THE ROCK WAS PERPENDICULAR AND OFFERED NO FOOTHOLD
STEADY RAM LAD CAME IN A GRUFF WHISPER
DON'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE I SHOULD THINK WHETHER YOU FALL ONE HUNDRED FEET OR FIVE
HE COULD NOT RISK THE JOURNEY WITHOUT A LIGHT AND HE STOOD WAITING AND TRYING TO MAKE OUT THE SHADOWY FIGURES ONE OF WHOM LOOKED STRANGELY UNCOUTH BENEATH HIS LOAD WHILE THE OTHER WAS QUITE SHORT
AWAY TO LEFT AND RIGHT SENTRIES WERE PLACED FROM AMONG THE HAULERS WHO AS THEY GREW TIRED BY THEIR EXERTIONS IN RUNNING UP THE KEGS WERE PLACED THERE TO REST AND LISTEN FOR DANGER FROM SEAWARD
THAT HIGHEST ONE IS WHERE YOU AND MR GURR WERE AT THE BURNING OUT OF THE SMUGGLERS TEN YEARS AGO
YOU HADN'T GOT THE BOAT AND YOU DIDN'T BRING NO ROPE
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE AND I WOULDN'T USE THE SWEEPS TILL I WAS OUT OF HEARING AND THEN--OH HERE WE ARE UP ATOP FOR THE SHEEP-TRACK HAD COME TO AN END UPON WHAT WAS REALLY THE DANGEROUS PART OF THE JOURNEY
I WISH I DID NOT KEEP ON THINKING ABOUT TUMBLING HE FORCED HIMSELF TO STUDY THE NEXT PART OF HIS DESCENT WHICH WAS NEARLY PERPENDICULAR BUT WELL BROKEN UP WITH LEDGES AND CRACKS WHICH OFFERED GOOD HOLDING AND TERMINATED A HUNDRED FEET BELOW UPON A SHELF WHICH NATURALLY OFFERED ITSELF AS HIS NEXT RESTING-PLACE BUT BEYOND WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
SHE THOUGHT
AND FEELING THAT HE WAS SEEN THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS ABOUT TO LEAP UP JUMP OVER THE LOW WALL AND RUN WHEN HE HEARD STEPS
HARDLY HAD HE FINISHED WHEN THERE WAS A BURST OF BARKING A RUSH AND A DOG CAME HURRYING TOWARD HIM FOLLOWED BY A VOICE CRYING GRIP GRIP COME HERE THE DOG SEEMED TO PAY NO HEED TO THE CALL AND AT A TURN OF THE TRACK ARCHY SAW HIM COMING OPEN-MOUTHED
WE ARE HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS AND WE DO IT IN THE KING'S NAME MRS SHACKLE RESPONDED WITH HER BEST CURTSEY AND A SMILE CAME BACK IN HER FACE AS THE FARMER SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT MISSUS
ARE YOU ALL READY AY AY HOLD YOUR BREATH THEN AS YOU GET TO THE FIRE AND FOLLOW ME THROUGH THAT BLAZE MY LAD WHISPERED THE MASTER
HE WAS FULLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FEET FROM THE TOP OF THE HUGE CLIFF AND HALF AFRAID NOW THAT HE SHOULD BE QUITE AFRAID HE DETERMINED TO LOSE NO TIME AND GOING TO THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD CREPT ON TO THE NICHE FLOOR HE BEGAN TO LOWER HIMSELF SLOWLY DOWN
WHAT SHALL I DO HE ASKED HIMSELF FOR HE WAS BETWEEN TWO PARTIES AND A STEP MIGHT MEAN DISCOVERY
WAS THERE TRUTH IN THEM OR WERE THEY THE UTTERANCES OF A MALICIOUS MIND WHICH WISHED TO TORTURE ONE WHO WAS IN ITS POWER
YOUR INFORMATION MAY NOT BE WORTH FIFTY PENCE
AT LAST HE FELT HIS WAY TO A GREAT MASS OF ROCK UPON WHICH ABOUT LEVEL WITH HIS HEAD WAS A PROJECTION UPON WHICH THE BASKET STOOD WELL ENOUGH AND TRUSTING TO BEING ABLE TO FIND IT AGAIN BY MEANS OF THE GREAT BLOCK HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE LANTHORN
PERHAPS MR RAYSTOKE HERE MIGHT LIKE A LITTLE
MRS SHACKLE SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED YES MISS BUT I WASN'T WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN SUCH A DANGEROUS PLACE EH SAID RAM CHANGING COLOUR
AND IN THE FLASH OF FLAME WHICH FOLLOWED THE PLACE GLOWED WITH A GHASTLY LIGHT
HE COULD UNDERSTAND THIS MAN BEING THE BEARER WHILE HE WAS EMPLOYED AT THE MASON WORK
NO GOOD YOUNGSTER GROWLED THE SMUGGLER AS HE CARRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN DOWN THE SLOPE AND HELD HIM AT THE BOTTOM
WHY SHOULD I CAUSE YOU MADE ME HAVE THAT FALL AND MY HEAD'S BEEN TREBBLE
HE RECOLLECTED IT ALL NOW EVEN TO HIS SITTING DOWN IN THE CHAIR WEARIED OUT
YOU'VE ONLY TO LEAVE YOUR SIDE DOOR OPEN AND GO TO BED
IT'S A PITY TOO THE LATTER CONTINUED SPECIALLY AS WE OFTEN HAVE SO MUCH FISH WE PUTS IT ON THE LAND ER--IF YOU WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SEND A LITTLE FISH--OF COURSE VERY FRESH MASTER SHACKLE AND A FEW EGGS AND A LITTLE BUTTER TO THE HOZE AND LET ME HAVE YOUR BILL BY AND BY I SHOULD BE GRATIFIED ON'Y TOO GLAD SIR RISDON I WILL.--THINK ANY ONE'S BEEN TELLING TALES TALES BOUT US SIR RISDON ABOUT US YOU SEE THE REVENUE CUTTER'S HANGING ABOUT HERE A DEAL AND IT LOOKS BAD SURELY NO ONE WOULD BETRAY YOU MASTER SHACKLE HOPE NOT SIR RISDON
I DO NOT COME HERE VERY OFTEN RAM SHE SAID QUIETLY
STUBBORN BRUTE
AND IT WAS DECIDED TO CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION AFTER GURR HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE MEN WERE ALL PRESENT THOUGH THEY LEARNED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF HAILING BEFORE ALL WERE COLLECTED
I SAY ORFICER HE SAID I KNOW WHERE YOUR LITTLE SWORD IS
AND A COLD DAMP PERSPIRATION BEDEWED THE MIDSHIPMAN'S FACE AS HE FELT HOW NEAR THEY BOTH WERE TO A TERRIBLE END
HE KNEW LITTLE ABOUT THE DISTRICT HIS IDEAS OF THE PLACE BEING PRINCIPALLY CONFINED TO WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF THE COAST-LINE FROM THE SEA BUT RUGGED PILES OF STONE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO HIM HERE AND THERE AS BEING THE REFUSE OF THE STONE THAT HAD BEEN AGES BEFORE DUG AND REGULARLY MINED BY SHAFTS AND GALLERIES OUT OF THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
COME AND SEE ARCHY MADE A VIOLENT STRUGGLE TO ESCAPE BUT THE MAN'S ARMS WERE TIGHT ROUND HIS WAIST HE WAS LIFTED OFF THE SLOPE AND AS HE FULLY REALISED THAT IN A WRESTLING MATCH NO MATTER HOW ACTIVE AND STRONG SEVENTEEN MAY BE IT IS NO MATCH FOR BIG WELL-SET SEVEN-AND-THIRTY
IT SCARS ME SOMETIMES THE WAY THEY DODGES US AND GETS AWAY
SO HERE'S TO LUCK AS HE SPOKE HE OPENED A CORNER CUPBOARD TOOK OUT A BOTTLE OF SPIRITS WHICH HAD NEVER PAID DUTY POURED OUT AND DRANK A GLASS
LET ME GO FIRST MY LAD FOR ANSWER THE MIDSHIPMAN WENT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ROUGH STEPS AND STOOD OVER THE TRAP-DOOR ON THE LOOSE STONES
SORT OF CHAP WHO'D GO TO SLEEP ALL NIGHT ARCHY BEGAN WONDERING
KNOCK ANY MAN DOWN WHO RESISTS
JEMMY HE SAYS TALLY'S GOT NO MILK IN HER HOW DO HE KNOW CRIED JEM SCORNFULLY
JUST REMEMBERED SAID ITS BEARER
THEN AFTER GLANCING RUEFULLY AT THE BRIGHT LITTLE WEAPON HALFWAY UP THE BLADE OF A RICH DEEP BLUE IN WHICH WAS FIGURED A PATTERN IN GOLD HE YIELDED TO NECESSITY AND BEGAN TO CHOP AT THE TOP BAR OF THE GRATE SO AS TO NICK THE EDGES OF HIS WEAPON AND MAKE IT SAW-LIKE
WHAT DO YOU WANT CRIED THE MAN AT THE SIDE AS THE BOAT CAME ON AND THE LIEUTENANT BADE THE MAN ASK
THANK YE SIR
THERE RUN ALONG LIKE A GOOD BOY AND YOU MUST ASK FOR HER LADYSHIP AND BE VERY RESPECTFUL AND SAY MOTHER'S HUMBLE DUTY TO YOU MY LADY AND HOPES YOU WON'T MIND HER SENDING A BIT O FARM FARE BUT SHE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL TO US MOTHER AND SO SHE WILL BE RAM BUT YOU MAKE ME SPEAK AS THOUGH WE WERE TO BE MUCH OBLIGED TO HER FOR TAKING ALL THESE GOOD THINGS YOU TAKE THE BASKET AND HOLD YOUR TONGUE
HEY BOOT WE ARE OUT O LUCK DON'T SIT MUTTERING AND GRUMBLING THERE MY LAD BUT PULL HARD AND LET'S GET ABOARD CRIED THE MASTER AND THE OARS DIPPED AWAY IN THE DARK SEA SEEMING TO SPLASH UP SO MUCH PALE LAMBENT FIRE AT EVERY STROKE
AND THE LANTHORNS HAD TO BE SHIFTED TWICE AS THE STACKS OF KEGS AND BALES INCREASED TILL JUST AS THE BOY BEGAN TO THINK THE LOADS WOULD NEVER END HE REALISED THAT THE FRENCH SAILORS HAD NOT BEEN UP LATELY AND ONE OF THEIR OWN MEN SUDDENLY SAID LAST RAM DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF AS THE MEN CAME OUT SILENTLY AND HE STOPPED BEHIND WITH ONE LANTHORN ONLY ALIGHT TO LOCK THE DOOR OF THE GREAT VAULT AND THEN STOOD IN THE STONE PASSAGE THINKING HOW QUIET AND STILL THE HOUSE SEEMED
BOY THERE WAS A RUSH HERE AND THERE IN THE DARKNESS THE LINE BEING COMPLETELY BROKEN AND THE MEN WHO COMPOSED IT CAUGHT SIGHT FROM TIME TO TIME OF A SHADOWY FIGURE TO WHICH THEY GAVE CHASE AS IT DODGED IN AND OUT OF THE BUSHES DOUBLING ROUND MASSES OF WEATHER-WORN STONE PLUNGING INTO HOLLOWS BEING LOST IN ONE PLACE AND FOUND IN ANOTHER BUT ALWAYS PROVING TOO ACTIVE FOR ITS PURSUERS WHO STUMBLED ABOUT AMONG THE ROUGH GROUND AND DANGEROUS SLOPES
KEEPS ON BRINGING YOU NUTS AND YOU'RE SO SNARKY THAT YOU WON'T SO MUCH AS GIVE ONE BACK THE SHELLS
I DON'T THINK I CAN LET YOU GO ALONE MY LAD IF I DON'T GO ALONE SIR IT'S OF NO USE YOU ARE RIGHT
FOR RAM'S REAL VOICE CAME FROM RIGHT AT THE OTHER END ECHOING ALONG THE ROOF
YOU COULD MAKE OUT THE SHELF ON THE BIG CLIFF IF YOU HAD YOUR GLASS
TRY TO CREEP FARTHER ON TO THE ROCK
DO YOU HEAR
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME WELL NOT TO-NIGHT MY LAD
WISH I HAD MY PIPE AHOY SHOUTED ARCHY BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
AND SO HE FOLLOWED HER ALONG UNWILLINGLY TILL LOW DOWN IN THE HOLLOW AS SHE TURNED SUDDENLY BY A PILE OF GREAT BLOCKS OF WEATHER-WORN AND LICHENED STONE SHE CAME SUDDENLY UPON DADD AND RAM THE FORMER FLAT ON HIS BACK WITH HIS HAT DRAWN-DOWN OVER HIS EYES THE LATTER BUSY WITH HIS KNIFE CUTTING A ROUGH STICK SMOOTH
LUGGER GONE HOUR AND A HALF AGO LAD
HE'S A MISERABLE CONTEMPTIBLE BEGGAR SAID ARCHY AT LAST BUT I NEED NOT HAVE BEEN QUITE SO ROUGH WITH HIM AS I WAS CHAPTER THIRTY
BAY OPENS JUST BEYOND THAT ROCK WHERE I'LL LIE CLOSE IN AND WAIT FOR HER SAID THE LIEUTENANT
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE
WHY NOT
IT'S QUITE LIKELY THAT THE SIGNALS I SAW LAST NIGHT MAY MEAN BUSINESS FOR TO-NIGHT
DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM GETTING VERY LATE SAID THE LITTLE OFFICER AFTER ANOTHER SWEEP OF THE TOP OF THE CLIFF ESPECIALLY ABOVE WHERE THE FRENCH LUGGER LANDED THE GOODS
SO NEAR SUCCESS AND YET TO FAIL AH DEARY DEARY ME SAID A VOICE FROM CLOSE AT HAND I'M VERY SICK AND TIRED OF IT ALL
THEY HAD COME TO THE DESCENT ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE VAST HILL BY WHOSE TOP THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING
A BOAT WOULD COME ASHORE HE WOULD BE FETCHED OUT OF THIS MISERABLE BLACK HOLE
GURR TURNED ANGRILY AWAY AND TO FIND HIMSELF FACING DICK
I KNEW IT HE CRIED AS HE GAZED OVER ONCE MORE FARTHER IN TOWARD THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE CHASM WHICH LOOKED AS THOUGH THE ROCK HAD BEEN SPLIT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
AND THE FIRST THING IS TO GET THE MEN TOGETHER
WE MAY GET OFF YET AND IF WE DO--WELL IT WON'T BE THE FIRST TIME
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER FIGHT
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS-LOOKING IN THESE ANCIENT QUARRIES WHERE FOOT OF MAN NEVER TROD NOW AND SHE SHIVERED AS SHE PASSED FUNNEL-SHAPED HOLES WHICH SHE KNEW WERE PRODUCED BY THE FALLING IN OF THE SURFACE TO FILL UP PASSAGES AND CHAMBERS IN THE STONE WHOSE ROOFS HAD GIVEN WAY FAR BELOW
HIS HOPES BEGAN TO RISE BUT THEY FELL DIRECTLY FOR HE FOUND IT WAS A CLOSET
CAN YOU KEEP CLOSE BEHIND US MY LADS
IT'S PLAGUEY DARK SAID RAM TO HIMSELF
WELL SAID ARCHY AS THERE WAS NO FURTHER SOUND HEARD I'M NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THIS
LOAD UP CAREFULLY WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE CARTS AND WE SHALL GET ALL SNUG BEFORE DAYLIGHT A MURMUR OF ACQUIESCENCE FOLLOWED AND THEY BEGAN TO TRAMP VERY CLOSE TO WHERE THE MIDSHIPMAN LAY EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE SEEN
SEIZED HIS HANDS SHOOK THEM BOTH AND WAS ABOUT TO HUG HIM BUT SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HIMSELF HE DREW BACK
HE'S TIGHT ENOUGH CRIED THE MAN THROWING A STURDY ARM ABOUT THE MIDDY'S WAIST AND HOLDING HIM BACK AS HE TRIED TO GET AT RAM
BUT IN SPITE OF THE DOG'S SCRATCHING SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE ANYTHING WAS THERE AND SHE WAS BENDING FORWARD GAZING INTO THE HALF CHOKED-UP LEVEL PASSAGE BEFORE HER WHEN THERE CAME FROM UNDER HER FEET THE SAME SMOTHERED AHOY SHE STARTED AWAY CLINGING TO THE SIDE FOR SUPPORT AND READY IN HER FEAR TO RUSH BACK TO THE SURFACE
VERY LITTLE MORE WAS SAID TILL THEY REACHED HOME AND RAM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT THE FARM TILL AFTER SUPPER WISHING THAT HE COULD HELP THE MIDSHIPMAN TO ESCAPE WITHOUT GETTING HIS FATHER INTO TROUBLE
WHEN'LL WE DO IT
BUT MAY I ASK YOU IF YOU DO SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING OF SUCH A LAD YOU WILL SEND A MESSENGER OFF TO THE CUTTER IT IS HARDLY RIGHT TO ENLIST ME IN THE SEARCH FOR ONE OF YOUR DESERTERS SAID SIR RISDON COLDLY
WANT A RUN ASHORE NO SIR
THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN AS CAN MILK TALLY AND THAT'S ME TURN THE BOAT'S HEAD AND LET'S GO FOR HER CK EJACULATED JEMMY AGAIN
WHY WHAT'S SHE GOING TO DO SAID GURR
THE CHANGE DID COME RAM APPEARING THE NEXT DAY WITH THE BASKET
BUT THOUGH THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY OPEN HE COULD NOT SEE
HE WAS A BIG BROAD-SHOULDERED HEAVY FELLOW WITH ROUGH BLACK BEARD AND DARK EYES WHICH GLOWERED AT THOSE AROUND AS A LANTHORN WAS HELD UP BY ONE OF THE MEN
THE PRISONER WAS AS HE SAID QUITE RIGHT FOR THAT DAY CELIA GRAEME HAD WANDERED DOWN TOWARDS THE EDGE OF THE HUGE LINE OF CLIFFS IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO THAT WHICH IT WAS HER WONT TO TAKE
PERHAPS TWENTY SAID THE LIEUTENANT EAGERLY
DON'T THINK THEER'S ANYTHING QUEER ABOUT EM DO YOU QUEER
AH I SEE YOU SIR
WHAT SHOULD HE DO
WHAT SHOULD HE DO
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY YOU SCOUNDREL CRIED ARCHY WHO WAS EXASPERATED ALMOST BEYOND BEARING
NAY SIR
IT SEEMS TO BE THEIR COW
GO AND GET ME A BISCUIT DICK THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW THE SAILOR SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH AND TOOK OUT A BRASS BOX
GET UP
HE WAS DESCENDING THE SLOPE TOWARD THE ROAD LEADING TO THE COVE AS FAR AS HE COULD TELL FOR IT SEEMED TO HIM LIKELY THAT THE FARMER AND HIS SON HAD GONE IN THAT DIRECTION
THE POOR BOY WAS OUT ALL NIGHT LOOKING AFTER SIGNALS AND BANG
AND KNOWING HIS WAY BETTER NOW AND THINKING OF THE DOG THE WHILE HE HURRIED ON AND HAD NEARLY REACHED THE HOUSE MEANING TO HIDE SOMEWHERE AMONG THE ABUNDANT SHRUBS WHICH SURROUNDED IT TILL THE SMUGGLERS HAD PASSED WHEN ALL DOUBT AS TO THE PARTY BEING THOSE HE WAS TRACKING WAS CHASED AWAY BY HIS HEARING A VOICE JUST BEFORE HIM SAY ALL RIGHT FATHER
THE MAN LAUGHED SOFTLY
I THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGHT THEN AS HE SAT ON THE STONES HE BEGAN TO COOL DOWN AND GROW LESS FIERCE IN HIS IDEAS
THERE WAS THE NICKING OF FLINT AND STEEL A FAINT BLUE LIGHT AND THE SNAP OF THE CLOSING LANTHORN AS THE DARK PASSAGE SHOWED A YELLOW GLOW
YOU WILL SEND FOR HELP I CANNOT SOBBED THE GIRL UNLESS YOU WILL PROMISE NOT TO TELL THERE WAS A PAUSE AGAIN
ONE MOMENT
ONE MOMENT
DICK FOLLOWED LAST SHAKING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED OR KEPT ON LOOKING BACK AT JEMMY WHO STOOD LIKE A STATUE RESTING HIS CHIN UPON THE SHAFT OF HIS PITCHFORK WATCHING HIM GO AWAY
SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS LAST NIGHT MR GURR EH MR RAYSTOKE SIR
BECAUSE LOOK HERE IT MAY BE A SERIOUS THING FOR SOME OF YOU IF HE IS NOT FOUND THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STARED AS IF HE DIDN'T HALF UNDERSTAND THE DRIFT OF WHAT WAS SAID
BUT I'VE GOT MY DUTY TO DO SIR
OUT WITH YOU RAM THE BOY WENT THROUGH LIKE A RABBIT PASSING SOMETHING DARK BEFORE HIM AND THEN RAPIDLY ONE BY ONE THE MEN FOLLOWED WITH THE FLAMES ROARING HORRIBLY NOW BELOW AND EXPLOSION AFTER EXPLOSION FOLLOWING QUICKLY THE CAVE RAPIDLY BECOMING A RESERVOIR OF FIRE
FOR THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE FACT THAT THE KEGS WERE FULL OF SMUGGLED SPIRIT
WISH I COULD SAIL ABOARD A BOAT LIKE THAT AND BE DRESSED LIKE THAT YOUNG CHAP WITH HIS SWORD
OH MY HEAD
OH MY HEAD
OH MY HEAD
HE TRIED THE EXPERIMENT AND SWUNG PAST RAM AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT DARED NOT LEAVE GO FOR FEAR OF MISSING THE ROCK WITH HIS FEET
FOR A BETTER BOY NEVER STEPPED FOR A SMUGGLER EH SAID THE LIEUTENANT DRILY
I WAS JUST THINKING I SHOULD HAVE LIKED SOME NEW MILK SO WAS I SIR
MOTHER SAID I WAS TO BE SURE AND TAKE BACK THAT BASKET
YOU WON'T SEE HIM AGAIN WON'T I MUTTERED GURR BETWEEN HIS TEETH
I NEVER DID HE EXCLAIMED AFTER STANDING LISTENING FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF THE GIRL WOULD REPENT AND RETURN
AND US NEVER TO HAVE BEEN ALONG HERE AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE TIDE TO FIND THIS HOLE THOUGHT ARCHY AS IN OBEDIENCE TO A SIGN HE STEERED THE BOAT ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL TRANSPARENT POOL AND LAID HER ALONGSIDE THE SMUGGLERS BOAT
TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT THERE RIGHT AWAY BEFORE HIM WAS RAM'S LANTHORN BURNING BRIGHTLY WITH THE DOOR OPEN AND SHINING UPON THE OLD SAILS AND SHIPPING GEAR STORES AND REMAINS OF WRECKS SAVED FROM THE SEA
THERE HAD BEEN WRECKS ON THE FREESTONE SHORE WHICH MADE HER SHUDDER AS SHE RECALLED HOW THE WILD CRIES OF THE HAPLESS MARINERS IN THEIR APPEALS FOR HELP HAD REACHED THE SHORE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
NO USE TO RILE CONTINUED THE BOY AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT SO TAKE IT EASY
I'M SURE YOU NEEDN'T BE SO CROSS THIS MORNING MASTER SAID MRS SHACKLE REPROACHFULLY
BE FIRM SHE WHISPERED
THEN WE'LL RISK IT
AY AY SIR SAYS HE WON'T COME
AT THE FARM
WE'LL FETCH YOU OUT AND BURY YOU AT SEA DICK DROVE HIS ELBOW INTO THE MAN'S CHEST FOR AN ANSWER GRINNED AS HE FELT THE POINT OF HIS CUTLASS AND DIVED INTO THE HOLE WHILE THE BOATSWAIN AND HIS MEN STOOD WAITING EAGERLY READY TO PLUNGE FORWARD AT THE FIRST SOUND OF A SCUFFLE
FOR NOW IT WAS OVER HE BARKED MADLY AND RUSHED ROUND AND ROUND THE BOY IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY
THE DOOR WAS TOO STRONG TO ATTACK AND HE REMEMBERED THE THREE FASTENINGS
I'LL TAKE THE HELM WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM GOING TO LET A STRANGE MAN PILOT MY VESSEL YAH GROWLED THE MAN
FOR IN THEIR IGNORANCE THE SEARCH PARTY WERE GOING TO MAKE A JOURNEY OF TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES ROUND EACH WAY WHEN ANY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO THE PLACE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP IN LESS THAN TWO
I GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE THOUGH--WILL YOU GIVE IN AND COME BACK QUIETLY IF YOU ATTEMPT TO COME NEAR ME YOU DOG SAID ARCHY SLOWLY THROUGH HIS CLENCHED TEETH I'LL KNOCK YOU OFF HERE INTO THE SEA WILL YOU CRIED RAM DASHING AT HIS LATE PRISONER AGAIN DODGING THE BLOW STRUCK AT HIM CLOSING WITH HIS ADVERSARY
THAT WAS A GLEAM OF LIGHT SOME DISTANCE OFF SHINING ON THE RUGGED WALLS OF A VAST CHAMBER OR SET OF CHAMBERS
HERE WAS NEWS
I AM IN COMMAND OF THIS EXPEDITION AND YOU LEAD THE MEN AWAY LIKE A PACK OF MAD MARCH HARES AND NOW I FIND YOU HERE WITHOUT THEM
HE WENT ON AND FOUND A CLOSET TO MATCH THE FIRST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE
BUT HE DID NOT STAY
I MEAN IT
COOSH COW THEN HE SAID SOOTHINGLY
TAKE YOUR BASKET TO THE SIDE DOOR AND DELIVER YOUR MESSAGE TO KEZIAH SHE SAID DISTANTLY
I ENTRUSTED YOU WITH AN IMPORTANT COMMISSION
HOW MANY HORSES HAS YOUR FATHER GOT THREE WHAT COLOUR ARE THEY BLACK WHITE AND GREY TURN ROUND THREE TIMES AND CATCH WHOM YOU MAY THAT AS EVERYONE KNOWS IS THE CLASSICAL WAY OF BEGINNING THE GAME OF BLIND MAN'S BUFF
HOW STRANGE THAT ALL WAS
AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MR GURR FATHER THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
AND YOU ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING THEM CONCEALED HERE ME CRIED SHACKLE BURSTING INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER
THEN AN EASY-CHAIR
BAD JOB WE'VE GOT NO LANTHORNS SAID GURR WHO WAS LOOKING OVER ARCHY'S SHOULDER AT THE LOW-BROWED ARCH OF THE PASSAGE LEADING RIGHT IN
KEEP A SHARP LOOK-OUT THEN AND MIND NO ONE GETS BY THE LITTLE FORCE ADVANCED WITH THE MEN SPREAD OUT TO RIGHT AND LEFT THE OFFICERS IN THE CENTRE FOLLOWING THE TRAIL WHICH LED RIGHT TO THE GULLY-LIKE DEPRESSION ONCE DOUBTLESS A WELL-WORN TRACK BUT NOW COMPLETELY SMOOTHED OVER AND GRASS-GROWN
I CANNOT THINK WHAT YOU WERE DOING MR GURR TO ADVISE ME TO DO SUCH A THING ME SIR SAID THE MASTER LOOKING ASTONISHED
YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP IT YES YOU CAN
BUT ONE MINUTE
WAIT A MOMENT SAID RAM SECURING THE END OF THE ROPE AND THROWING THE COIL OVER HIS SHOULDER
NOW MY LADS GIVE WAY THE MIST WAS PATCHY THIN HERE AND THICK THERE BUT IT SEEMED AN EASY TASK TO OVERTAKE THE BOAT WHICH HAD GLIDED INTO THE FOG GOING SLOWLY WITH HER LITTLE SAIL SET AND WITH ONLY A MAN AND BOY FOR CREW
HE COULD SEE NO SIGN TO HELP HIM AND AS A KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT ASSAILED HIM THAT HE SHOULD HAVE GOT SO NEAR LIBERTY AND HAVE TO GIVE UP HE DECIDED THAT THE WAY TO FREEDOM WAS DOWNWARD
TO THINK OF THE BOY BEING MISSING LIKE THIS.--NOW YOU SIRS IN WITH THAT BOAT.--WHERE CAN HE BE
CONFESS IT ISN'T HALF SO BEAUTIFUL AS THIS OH YES IT IS SIR
LOTS TO DO TO-DAY SEEING THAT IT COULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE MORNING RAM ASKED HIMSELF WHAT WAS THE USE OF HIS GOING TO BED
I DESERVE TO LOSE MY RANK
DESSAY IF YOU WENT DOWN YOU'D COME UP AGAIN BUT YOU COULDN'T GET ASHORE WHY
HAH
HAH
HAH
NO OF COURSE NOT
THE TASK BECOMING EASY NOW FOR AS HE NEARED THE LIGHTS THE MAN GREW MORE CARELESS SO THAT IT WAS EASY TO TRACE HIS MOVEMENTS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY HOMEWARD TILL A FEW MINUTES LATER ARCHY SAW HIM PASS THE GLOWING WINDOW SWING OPEN A DOOR FROM WHICH CAME A BURST OF LIGHT PASS IN AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
ONE MOMENT SAID ARCHY AND GIVING ORDERS TO THE MEN TO SEPARATE SURROUND THE PREMISES AND SEARCH THE OUTBUILDINGS THEN STATIONING TWO MORE AT THE DOORS AND TAKING ONE GURR TO SEARCH UPSTAIRS HE FOLLOWED THE FARMER INTO A FAIRLY SPACIOUS STONE CELLAR WHERE THERE WAS A CIDER BARREL IN COMPANY WITH TWO OF ALE AND LITTLE KEGS OF ELDER WINE AND MEAD
ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE HERE I FEEL CERTAIN OF IT SAID ARCHY IN THE SAME LOW TONE
THEY MUST HAVE LAID ME HERE TO BE FETCHED OFF BY THE BOAT
THE FIRST WAS EASILY DONE THE LATTER IMPOSSIBLE
HERE FOUR OF YOU STOP HERE
HE HAS FOUND THEM RAM SHUT ONE OF HIS EYES AT JEMMY WHO MADE A RUMBLING NOISE BUT HIS FACE DID NOT CHANGE
HE MIGHT OVERTAKE HER BUT WOULD MORE PROBABLY LOSE HER IN THE DARKNESS AND SEE HER AT DAYBREAK PERHAPS WELL WITHIN REACH OF A PORT WHERE HE DARE NOT FOLLOW
YES I HAVE
DETERMINED ON IT HUMPH
OH THAT'S IT IS IT CRIED RAM FURIOUSLY
AND IT WILL KEEP UP APPEARANCES
A BOYISH PRANK
THAT WAS A HOT DAY AND NO MISTAKE SOMEHOW ARCHY FELT RELIEVED ABOUT THE GRAEMES AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE WENT AND REPORTED ALL HE HAD HEARD TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO NODDED HIS HEAD LOOKED SEVERE AND ORDERED THE TWO BOATS TO BE MANNED
WE'LL TAKE HIM WITH US
DICK TAKE THE OUTSIDE NOW AND BE CAREFUL
I CAN'T SIGNAL EVEN IF I COULD FIND MY WAY TO THE CLIFF AND I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK HERE AT ONCE TO SEIZE ALL THIS STORE AND MORE UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS CAME BACK NOW ABOUT HOW HARD IT SEEMED TO HAVE TO BETRAY THESE PEOPLE
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO
I REGRET TO HAVE TO COME IN THIS UNCEREMONIOUS WAY SIR SAID THE LIEUTENANT
MRS SHACKLE COMPLAINED BITTERLY TO HER LORD AND MASTER ABOUT DIFFERENT LOTS OF CREAM BEING SPOILED BUT FARMER SHACKLE SNUBBED HER
THAT THERE DOG
YOU ROPE'S-END ME HE SAID
THAT'S IT SAID RAM
A GOOD SWIMMER COULD GET ROUND THE POINT THERE AND MAKE FOR THE LEDGE WHERE I SAW YOU AND THAT MAN LAND NO YOU COULDN'T SAID RAM
THEN HE POKED HIS RED WORSTED CAP A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE WITH THE SAME IMPLEMENT AND SCRATCHED THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND CAREFULLY ARRANGED THE RED CAP AGAIN
IT WAS GOOD WHOLESOME CIDER AND BEING SEVENTEEN AND GROWING FAST ARCHY FORGOT EVERYTHING FOR THE NEXT HALF-HOUR IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A HEARTY MEAL
AND THE CUTTER NOW WELL OUT IN THE NORTH-EAST WIND THEN BLOWING LEANED OVER AND SKIMMED RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DARK SEA
NOW MR RAYSTOKE NO SIR YOU I SAY YOU AND I ARCHY YIELDED TO HIS SUPERIOR IN THE EXPEDITION CREPT OUT AND THE MASTER WAS FOLLOWING AND GOT STUCK BUT A FIERCE TUG FROM A COUPLE OF THE MEN SET HIM FREE AND HE HAD ONLY JUST JOINED THE TWO BOATS CREWS STANDING SIDE BY SIDE ON THE SHELF OF ROCK WHEN THE WHOLE CLIFF SEEMED TO SHAKE
IF HE'D AS GOOD AS SAID DON'T GO UP THERE AND TRIED TO STOP US WE SHOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE BUT WE CAN'T GO BACK AND SEARCH GURR
THEN MORE GENTLY I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF BO'S'N WE CAN'T DO IT NO CAME BACK ABRUPTLY
NOT A NOISY SEA-GOING FIT OF PASSION FULL OF LOUD WORDS SUCH AS ARE NOT FOUND IN DICTIONARIES BUT A RISING AND FALLING SWELLING AND COLLAPSING SILENT FIT OF PASSION AS MOMENT BY MOMENT HE REALISED MORE AND MORE THAT HE HAD BEEN VICTIMISED AND THAT HE HAD BEEN SENT FORWARD TO QUIET THE MEN SO AS TO GIVE THE BIG ROUGH FELLOW AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREEP OVER INTO HIS BOAT AND CUT THE PAINTER BY WHICH IT WAS MADE FAST AND LET IT GLIDE AWAY ON THE TIDE TILL IT WAS SAFE TO THRUST AN OAR OVER ASTERN AND USING IT LIKE A FISH DOES ITS TAIL PADDLE SOFTLY AWAY CLOSE UNDER THE ROCKS TO SOME HOLE OR PERHAPS ROUND INTO THE BAY
THREE DAYS PASSED AND THE IDEA OF LOSING HER COMPANION WAS SO STARTLING TO CELIA THAT SHE MADE NO FURTHER JOURNEY TOWARD THE CLIFFS IN SPITE OF SEVERAL EFFORTS MADE BY GRIP TO COAX HER IN THAT DIRECTION
LOOK AT HER CHEWING WHY SO SHE IS SAID THE SAILOR SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AS HE WATCHED THE REGULAR ACTIONS OF THE COW'S JAW AS SHE STOOD BLINKING HER EYES AND SWINGING HER TAIL TO AND FRO APPARENTLY QUITE CONTENT
I DO SAY SO CRIED ARCHY
NOT A BAD SORT OF BOY
AND IT'S SMASHED NOW
THEY WENT OFF AFTER A BOY THE MASTER SPOKE SO CIVILLY NOW THAT ARCHY FORGOT HIS ANGER AND ENTERED INTO THE TROUBLE WARMLY
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND HE HAS BEEN TOO CLEVER FOR US
JEMMY DADD SEEMED TO BE GOING NOWHERE AND AS HE SLOUCHED ALONG LIFTING UP ONE HEAVY SEA BOOT AND PUTTING IT DOWN BEFORE THE OTHER HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD IN EITHER DIRECTION
BUT WHAT COULD HE DO
MUST HAVE LOOSENED THAT HE SAID
GOOD DOG THEN
WHAT DOES HE MEAN JEMMY THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD
BY THAT TIME THE CUTTER WAS SLOWLY GLIDING AWAY SEAWARD WITH EVERY EYE ON THE WATCH FOR AS THE LIEUTENANT EXPLAINED AFTER TELLING HIS RECOVERED OFFICER HOW HE HAD SEARCHED IN ALL DIRECTIONS HE HAD THAT NIGHT SEEN LIGHTS SHOWN FAR UP ON ONE OF THE CLIFFS--LIGHTS WHICH MIGHT MEAN A WARNING TO SOME VESSEL TO KEEP OFF OR JUST AS LIKELY MIGHT HAVE THE OTHER INTENTION AND BE AN INVITE TO SOME LUGGER TO LAND HER CARGO
FORWARD HE LED THE WAY INTO THE DARKNESS ONCE MORE BUT INTO AN ATMOSPHERE WHICH HE COULD BREATHE
IT WAS GONE
WHY--HULLO MR RAYSTOKE CRIED THE LIEUTENANT MERRILY
THEN HE FORGOT ALL DIRECTLY AS HE EXCLAIMED I SEE MR GURR I SEE
OH SAID RAM LAUGHING I CAN CLIMB DOWN
SLOW AS HIS PACE WAS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PRINTS OF THE BIG BOOTS WAS GREAT AND THE MUSHROOM HUNTING TOOK HIM BEFORE VERY LONG UP THE CLIFF BEYOND THE ENTRANCE TO THE OLD QUARRY THEN DOWN BELOW IT AND THEN CLOSE UP ALONGSIDE WHERE HE STOOPED OVER AND THEN WENT DOWN A FEW STEPS OUT OF SIGHT
THIS ONCE ONLY MASTER SHACKLE THANK YE SIR RISDON SAID THE MAN
NOW THEN ONCE--TWICE--FIRE HE POINTED THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL DOWNWARD AND DREW THE TRIGGER AND IN THE SEMI-DARKNESS BELOW THE OVERHANGING BRAMBLES AND CLEMATIS THERE WAS A DULL FLASH THE REPORT SOUNDED SMOTHERED AND THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH THE DANK HEAVY-SCENTED SMOKE
THERE WAS A FAMILIAR ODOUR TOO OF SALT AIR AND SEAWEED AND AS HE PLACED HIS EAR TO THE CHINK HE COULD HEAR AS IF FAR BELOW THE WASH OF WATER
AND I CALLED MY BOY RAMILLIES AND IF EVER HE GETS MARRIED AND HAS A SON HE'S TO BE MALPLACKEY
IT WAS JUST BEFORE SUNRISE TOO FOR THERE WERE FLECKS OF ORANGE HIGH UP IN THE SKY
ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE--MIDSHIPMAN ABOARD HIS MAJESTY THE KING'S CUTTER STATIONED OFF THE FREESTONE COAST TO PUT A STOP TO THE DOINGS OF A SMUGGLER WHOSE CAREER THE GOVERNMENT HAD THOUGHT IT HIGH TIME TO NOTICE--DREW IN A LONG BREATH AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT HUNGER AND COLD IN THE PROMISE OF A GLORIOUS DAY
YOU SEE HER LADYSHIP IS VERY FOND OF THE TASTE OF A FRESH GATHERED MUSHROOM AND IF I SEE A FEW I LIKE TO TAKE THEM TO THE HOZE AY TO BE SURE SAID SHACKLE AS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND PRECIOUS GLAD TO GET THEM YOU TWO POOR HALF-STARVED CREATURES WITH YOUR SHOW AND SHAM AND TITLES AND KEEP UP APPEARANCES I--ER--I HAVE NOT GOT MANY MASTER SHACKLE
CAN'T BE SIR SAID GURR AS HE TRIED TO PIERCE THE DARKNESS BECAUSE THE SKIPPER MUST BE LYING AT ANCHOR WHERE WE LEFT HIM HAH
COME ALONG JEMMY
WELL LET EM SAID JEMMY FOLLOWING SUIT WITH THE PAINTER THE COW STANDING CONTENTEDLY WITH HER EYES HALF-CLOSED
BUT AFTER PULLING BACK TO THE STARTING-POINT AND MAKING FOR THE OTHER DIRECTION THEY HAD NOT GONE FOUR HUNDRED YARDS UNDER THE CLIFF BEFORE THE MIDSHIPMAN EXCLAIMED EXCITEDLY THERE
BOUT MY COW HE SAID
BUT YOUR DINNER'S READY MR ORFICER
YOU LOST A CHANCE WHAT DO YOU MEAN JEMMY DADD ISN'T UP BY THE DOOR
PST HARDLY A BREATH COULD BE HEARD THEN AS EARS WERE STRAINED AND AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF DOUBT HAD BEEN FELT A KIND OF THRILL RAN THROUGH THE MEN WHO HAD TAKEN HOLD OF A LINE FASTENED TO A STANCHION AND LOWERED THEMSELVES DOWN TO THE BROAD LEDGE
HARD WORK GETTING DOWN HERE AND WRASTLING ARCHY WAS IN SO CRAMPED AND AWKWARD A POSITION HALF KNEELING THAT HE FOLLOWED HIS COMPANION'S EXAMPLE SHUDDERING SLIGHTLY THOUGH AS HE LET HIS LEGS GO DOWN AND PUT HIS HANDS BESIDE HIM TO PRESS HIS BACK FIRMLY AGAINST THE ROCK
BUT STOP
AGAIN THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY THE MASTER WHO RAGING WITH PAIN AND MORTIFICATION EXCLAIMED WELL MR RAYSTOKE SIR YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS PLACE
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE GULL LOOKED VERY SMALL AND FROM THAT BY DEGREES HE BEGAN TO REALISE THAT THE HOLE OUT OF WHICH HE HAD THRUST HIS HEAD WAS FULLY FOUR HUNDRED FEET ABOVE WHERE THE WAVES BROKE AND THAT IT MUST BE TWO HUNDRED MORE TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
IF THIS POOR CHILD SHOULD EVER KNOW INTO WHAT A PIT I HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE LED HOW CAN I EVER LOOK HER IN THE FACE AGAIN IT WOULD KILL HER FOR YOU TO BE TAKEN AWAY TO BE PUNISHED PERHAPS FOR THAT WHICH YOU COULD HARDLY HELP NO SHE WOULD SOON FORGET AND I SHOULD SOON FORGET SAID LADY GRAEME REPROACHFULLY
STOP HE SAID
AT SUCH TIMES HER HANDS GREW WET AND SHE RETRACED HER STEPS FANCYING THE WHILE THAT THE EARTH SOUNDED HOLLOW BENEATH HER TREAD
AND RAM LAY THERE EVIDENTLY STUNNED IF NOT KILLED
WITH A LANTHORN OR TORCH HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE SATISFIED HIMSELF UPON THIS POINT
THEN HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER THE BOY WAS ILL IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS FALL AND HE LONGED TO ASK BUT AS EVERYTHING HE SAID TO DADD WAS RECEIVED IN GLOOMY SILENCE HE FELT INDISPOSED TO QUESTION THE MAN AND WAITED PATIENTLY OR IMPATIENTLY TILL THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE
WHY THIS MUST BE AT THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF HE SAID JOYOUSLY
ONLY ONE'S FOR DOWNSTAIRS THE OTHER UP
TWO HOURS MORE PASSED AWAY DURING WHICH IT WAS A DEAD CALM AND THE SUN BEAT DOWN SO HOTLY THAT THE SEAMS BEGAN TO SEND OUT LITTLE BLACK BEADS OF PITCH AND DROPS FORMED UNDER SOME OF THE ROPES READY TO COME OFF ON THE FIRST HAND WHICH TOUCHED THEM
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE HERE THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU RAYSTOKE VERY GOOD SAID THE LIEUTENANT
MR RAYSTOKE LET HIM TAKE HIS COW AND GO AY AY SIR THEN GET THE GIG ALONGSIDE AND WE'LL EXPLORE ROUND MORE OF THE COAST CLOSE IN AY AY SIR
DICK SHADED HIS EYES FOR NO REASON WHATEVER THE SUN BEING AT HIS BACK AND GAZED AT THE OBJECT IN THE WATER
HOLD HIM TIGHT AY
GONE GONE YES SHE WENT OFF SOMEWHERE
AND A BIT OF PRIME TAY SUCH AS WOULD PLEASE HER LADYSHIP
NO SIR SHE SAID SHAKING HER FINGER AT HIM
IN FACT EVERY EYE WAS FIXED UPON THE TWO VESSELS IN THE OFFING WHILE IT SEEMED TO ARCHY THAT THE BOAT WHICH WAS SAILING RAPIDLY HAD CHANGED HER COURSE ON SEEING THEM AND WAS TRYING TO GET CLOSE UP UNDER THE CLIFFS APPARENTLY TO REACH THE COVE FROM WHICH THEY HAD COME
YES BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT SIR
IN A HORRIBLE POSITION YES IT WASN'T NICE
CAME ASHORE YESTERDAY LAD OF SEVENTEEN IN A RED CAP OH SAID JEMMY WITH A VACANT LOOK
SHE AREN'T HERE SIR SAID DICK
AS HE GREW MORE ABLE TO MOVE AND ACT THE SENSE OF CONFUSION WHICH SUDDENLY ARRESTED HIM WAS TERRIBLE--ALMOST MADDENING
OH NO I SHALL NOT SEARCH SIR
WELL I DON'T KNOW
SEE ANYTHING MY LAD YES
AM I NEVER TO HAVE A NIGHT'S REST AGAIN ALL THIS IN SMOTHERED TONES AS IF THE SPEAKER WAS SHUT UP IN A CUPBOARD WITH A BLANKET OVER HIS HEAD
CERTAINLY TO GET BACK TO THE SHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TILL MORNING AND HE WAS MILES AWAY FROM THE COVE
WELL MR RAYSTOKE CRIED THE LIEUTENANT AS THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN SPRANG OVER THE SIDE
THEY BEGAN IT CAME IN CHORUS
I WAS LOOKING CRIED RAM EXCITEDLY
THAT'S GOOD HALF AN HOUR SAID RAM LOWERING HIS LANTHORN OPENING THE DOOR AND PUFFING OUT THE CANDLE AFTERWARDS SERVING THE OTHERS THE SAME
WE'VE LOST THIS TIME SO LET'S GO BACK ABOARD ACCORDING TO ORDERS
GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR SHE WHISPERED
HENCE HER PRESENCE DURING THE SCENE AND WHEN SHE HAD AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THE MIDSHIPMAN HAD PLAYED SPY AND WAS READY TO DENOUNCE HER FATHER SHE FELT THAT ALL WAS OVER
WHY YOU DO NOT THINK ANY OF THAT SUPERSTITIOUS NONSENSE ABOUT THE BOAT DO YOU WELL SIR I DUNNO
I SHOULD THINK I CAN BUT DARE YOU VENTURE NOW RAM PUT HIS HAND TO HIS HEAD AND GAZED UP THOUGHTFULLY
WHY HERE IS ONE THERE WAS A BUZZ OF VOICES AND ARCHY FELT HIMSELF HOISTED UP
AT REGULAR INTERVALS THERE WAS A WHISHING NOISE THEN ANOTHER WHISHING NOISE HALF A TONE LOWER THEN WHISH_--_WHOSH_--_WHISH_--_WHOSH TWO STREAMS OF RICH NEW MILK BEGAN TO POUR INTO THE BUCKET WHOSE BOTTOM WAS SOON COVERED AND A WHITE FROTH BEGAN TO APPEAR ON THE TOP
THEN HOW DARE YOU HAVE THE EFFRONTERY TO TELL ME THAT YOU DID NOT MEAN `NOWT AS YOU HAVE THE CONFOUNDED NORTH COUNTRY INSOLENCE TO CALL IT
HOW DID THEY COME THERE WHY YOUR CHAPS PUT EM THERE
CAN YOU HEAR YES YES SAID THE GIRL HUSKILY AS A HORRIBLE SUSPICION RAN THROUGH HER MIND
I'VE GOT A BAD CHARACTER BUT YOU HAVEN'T NO NO MASTER SHACKLE
IT'S ALL DANGEROUS LONG HERE
AND LOOK SHARP SIR THE BOY WENT INTO THE BACK KITCHEN TOOK DOWN FROM A SHELF THREE HORN-LANTHORNS WHICH HAD THE PECULIARITY OF BEING PAINTED BLACK SAVE IN ONE NARROW PART
FOR IT WAS NOT DAMP BUT PERFECTLY DRY AND BELOW THE SCRAPS OF STONE IN THE SEAM THERE WAS FINE DUST
YOU MUST SEND A STRONG PARTY ASHORE AS SOON AS IT'S DAY BUT--BUT ARCHY ANSWERED THOSE BUTS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT GURR'S REPORT WAS NEEDLESS AND THE MASTER WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED
IN FACT HE WAS OBLIGED TO CHECK HIMSELF FOR HIS TASK NEEDED CARE
BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY?--I DID NOT SEE WHAT IT WAS
WELL WE'LL TRY
TAKE HER UP TO HER ROOM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO RISDON EXCLAIMED THE LADY
NOW THEN SIR LET'S LISTEN THEY LISTENED BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
HAUL AWAY HOW THAT HAULING UP WAS MANAGED THE MIDSHIPMAN HARDLY KNEW BUT HE HAD SOME CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING JOINED IN THE EFFORTS MADE BY SEIZING ONE MAN OF THE HUMAN CHAIN AND DIMLY SEEING GURR AND TWO OTHER MEN OF THE GROUP NOW GATHERED ABOUT THEM LEND THEIR AID
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
I SAY DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LIKE NOW I TOLD YOU A FISHER-BOY CRIED ARCHY IMPATIENTLY BUT TRYING NOT TO OFFEND HIS VISITOR WHO POSSESSED THE POWER OF CONFERRING FREEDOM BY SPEAKING SHARPLY
THOUGH THAT AREN'T LIKELY MR RAYSTOKE
IT COULD NOT BE THE CELLAR AS HE WENT IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER TOWARD THE WALLS AND HE STOOD AT LAST RESTING IN THE MOST UTTER BEWILDERMENT OF MIND AND HELPLESSNESS OF BODY POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE WHILE A CURIOUS FEELING OF AWE BEGAN TO STEAL OVER HIM
IF THEY WAS ALL RIGHT WE SHOULDN'T HA BEEN CRUISING BOUT HERE SEVEN WEEKS AND NEVER GOT A SIGHT O ONE OF EM WHEN WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN HERE ALL THE TIME I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU DICK SAID THE MIDDY AS HE WATCHED THE GOING AND COMING OF THE ROCK PIGEONS WHICH FLEW STRAIGHT FOR THE CLIFF SEEMED TO PASS RIGHT IN AND THEN DASHED OUT
MILK AND WATER CAME IN MUFFLED TONES
YOU DICK CRIED ARCHY YOU'RE A GOOSE
HOLD HARD MY LADS CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN AND THE MEN CEASED ROWING HOLDING THEIR OARS BALANCED WITH THE DIAMOND-LIKE DROPS FALLING SPARKLING FROM THEIR BLADES INTO THE CLEAR SEA WHILE THE BOAT GLIDED SLOWLY ON TOWARDS THE LEDGE WHICH WAS JUST IN FRONT
THE DISCOVERY OF THE WAY THROUGH THE CLIFF MADE CLEAR TO ARCHY SEVERAL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF RAM AND HIS COMPANION WITH THE BOAT FOR UPON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION IT HAD SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD HAVE ROWED SIX MILES TO THE COVE AND COME BACK AGAIN
THE IDEA WAS TERRIBLE AND UNABLE TO CONTAIN HIMSELF HE TOOK A STEP OR TWO IN ONE DIRECTION THEN IN ANOTHER AND STOPPED SHORT NOT DARING TO STIR FOR FEAR SOME AWFUL CHASM SUCH AS HE HAD SEEN AMONG THE ROCKS SHOULD BE YAWNING AT HIS FEET AND HE SHOULD FALL HEADLONG DOWN
LET ME TELL HIM I HAVE COME ON BOARD RIGHT MY LAD
FOR I SAID TO MYSELF `HE'LL COME BACK AND ASK FORGIVENESS TO-MORROW AND I'LL PUNISH HIM AND FORGIVE HIM FOR I DID NOT WANT TO BLAST YOUR CAREER
QUICK IMMATURED THOUGHTS WHICH SHOT THROUGH HIM AS HE WAS LED ALONG AND HE KNEW DIRECTLY AFTER THAT IT WAS ONLY FANCY
BEG PARDON SIR BUT MAY I ASK A FAVOUR A DOZEN IF YOU LIKE RAYSTOKE AND I'LL GRANT THEM IF I CAN
DOES HE THINK HE IS GOING TO DRAG ME UP THERE AGAIN
BUT NOW HE FOUND THAT THOUGH THERE WERE NO BED-CLOTHES HE WAS WEARING HIS OWN ONLY UPON FEELING ABOUT WITH NO LITTLE PAIN THEY DID NOT SEEM LIKE HIS CLOTHES
WHAT WOULD BE THE GOOD
INSTEAD OF THAT A MOST UNMISTAKABLE SMELL OF BRANDY CAME INTO HIS NOSTRILS
THIS WILL BE EASIER SOMEHOW HE DID NOT FEEL IN ANY HURRY TO BEGIN AND HE SAT DOWN WITH HIS LEGS HANGING OVER THE LEDGE TO GIVE HIS NERVES TIME TO CALM DOWN FOR THERE WAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO THROB ABOUT HIS PULSES AND HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONVERSANT WITH THE HOUSE HE LIVED IN TO KNOW THAT CONFINEMENT WORRY WANT OF FRESH AIR AND EXCESSIVE WORK DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS HAD NOT GIVEN HIM WHAT THE DOCTORS CALL TONE SO HE SAT THERE WITH HIS BACK TO THE ROCK GAZING OUT TO SEA AGAIN AND THEN WATCHING THE GRACEFUL CURVES MADE BY A GULL WHICH HAD RISEN HIGHER AND HIGHER AND CAME NEARER AND NEARER TILL IT WAS ON A LEVEL WITH HIM AND WATCHING HIM CURIOUSLY
GOVERNMENT HAS NO BOWELS OF COMPASSION MR RAYSTOKE
TOO HIGH CAN'T DO IT SAID THE MAN
IT'S OF NO USE
TOOK A LOT O TROUBLE FOR NOTHING BOY SAID THE SMUGGLER
CAN'T YOU SPEAK THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
MATTERS GREW NO BETTER
HURRAH HE SAID AFTER ANSWERING AGAIN AND WALKING IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH THE CRY CAME DOWNWARD IN ONE OF THE COMBE-LIKE HOLLOWS OF THE DISTRICT
OFF YOU GO WAS SAID ROUGHLY AND THE RUSTLING SOUND SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THE MAN HAD GONE BACK TOWARD THE COVE
YES OF COURSE
YES OF COURSE
IN ITS GREEN BAIZE BAG
NOW AND THEN AS HE GREW FAINT AND WEARY IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD MADE NO PROGRESS BUT THE LITTLE HEAP OF MORTAR TOLD DIFFERENT TALES AND ONCE MORE TAKING HEART HE TOILED AWAY
ONLY I ARN'T FOND ON HIM
HE WON'T FORGET THAT WHACK I GIVE HIM ON THE RIBS FOR LONG ENOUGH NEEDN'T HAVE THROWN SO HARD WHY NOT DON'T LIKE TO SEE DOGS HURT SAID RAM WHO WAS DEALING WITH AN AWKWARD KNOT
THE POWDER SMELLS BADLY AND IT WOULD BE VERY RISKY TO GO DOWN NOW FIRE SEEMS TO BE OUT SAID ARCHY AS HE HELD HIS HAND IN THE BLUISH SMOKE WHICH WAS DANK AND COLD
THE WALL HE HAD WORKED THROUGH DID NOT FACE OUT TO SEA BUT WAS ONE SIDE OF A CHASM AND HE GAZED AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE
GIVE'S YOUR PAW
WON'T YOU NOW MATE NO ROARED ARCHY
HUMANS MIGHT BUT COWS IS TOO CUNNING I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE CRIED THE LAD SMARTLY
I UNDERSTAND SIR YOU WISH TO SEARCH
HERE HE IS FOR THE MOMENT THE MIDSHIPMAN FELT DISPOSED TO DESCEND AGAIN BUT HE KEPT ON AND A MINUTE LATER HE LOOKED UP TO SEE RAM'S FRANK FACE LOOKING OUT OF THE HOLE AND THE BOY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND
BETTER SO THAN BEING THE SLAVE OF THAT WRETCHED MAN
ALL WAS STILL AS DEATH AND HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT
TWICE THIS HAPPENED AND THE THIRD TIME AS ALL WAS STILL AND HE COULD FEEL A HARD ROAD BENEATH HIS FEET HE BECAME SURE
YOU'VE HIT IT RIGHT IN THE BULL'S EYE YOU THINK SO NO SIR
IT'S OF NO USE TO BREAK YOUR BACKS AND YOUR HEARTS TOO
AHOY HE CRIED AT LAST AND AHOY CAME BACK FAINTLY
YES THE LIEUTENANT SAID RATS WILL RUN AWAY AS LONG AS THEY CAN BUT WHEN DRIVEN TO THE END OF THEIR HOLES THEY WILL FIGHT BUT WILL THEY DARE DO YOU THINK SIR SAID ARCHY
STILL THEY BEGAN TO APPEAR SOON AFTER AND THE FIRST ONE HE MENTALLY SAW WAS THE COMING OF RAM WITH HIS FOOD
THEM CELLARS ARE TOO VALLYBLE
I'VE BEEN A PRISONER THOSE WERE SMUGGLERS THEN YES CRIED ARCHY
WENT AFT SIR THE LITTLE OFFICER WENT AFT BUT THE FISHERMAN WAS NOT THERE AND HE PASSED BACK ALONG THE STARBOARD SIDE GOING RIGHT FORWARD AMONG THE CREW
SIR RISDON TURNED TO HER WILDLY AS SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HIS BREAST
OH PRAY PRAY TELL ME GENTLEMEN IS HE SAFE
SMUGGLERS SHOUTED GURR EXCITEDLY
YOU'RE ONLY A COMMON SAILOR DICK AND I'M YOUR OFFICER BUT THOUGH I SPEAK SHARP UNTO YOU I RESPECT YOU DICK FOR YOU LIKE THAT LAD SAY MESTER GURR SIR WHICH THANKFUL I AM TO YOU FOR SPEAKING SO
SURRENDER STILL NO REPLY
YOU CAN EASILY MAKE OUT THE RANGE OF CLIFFS
YOU WILL BETRAY YOURSELF WELL HE REPLIED BITTERLY WHY NOT
BOTHER THE WOMAN HE THOUGHT
THEY MUST HAVE TIED UP OLD GRIP HE GLANCED UP AT THE WINDOWS AS HE WENT OUT THEN THEY SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR IN THE MIST AS HE MADE FOR THE TRACK AND WENT DOWNWARDS TO HEAR LOW VOICES AND DIRECTLY AFTER HE ENCOUNTERED HIS FATHER
YOU CAN'T MISS IT AH MY FINE FELLOW HE CONTINUED AS HE WALKED BACK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOUR GANG WITH YOU HOW EASILY I COULD HAVE TURNED THE KEY AND KEPT YOU DOWN IN THAT CELLAR WHERE I WISH I HAD YOUR SKIPPER TOO OH BLENHEIM SAID HIS WIFE IN AN EXCITED WHISPER HOW COULD YOU HELP THEM TO GO UP TO THE HOZE
AND YET HE SEEMED TO BE STANDING ON THAT LEDGE CLOSE DOWN TO THE WATER FOR AS HE STOOPED DOWN NOW HE COULD TRACE WITH HIS HAND ONE OF THE HUGE CURLED-UP SHELL-FISH TURNED TO THE STONE IN WHICH IT WAS EMBEDDED WHILE AS HE FELT ABOUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND ANOTHER LARGER STILL
I SENT EM BECAUSE IF I HADN'T THEY'D HAVE FOUND THE WAY
AND AS THE ORDER WAS GIVEN TO SLIP THE ANCHOR WITH A SMALL BUOY LEFT TO MARK ITS PLACE THE INFORMER SECURED HIS BOAT TO ONE OF THE RINGBOLTS ASTERN AND THEN DREW CLOSE IN
LOOK THAT'S THE PLACE--WHERE THERE IS THAT NARROW RIFT AND IF YOU LOOK HIGH UP THERE IS A HOLE
COMPLETELY BURNED OUT THE WASPS NEST EH
AH EJACULATED RAM AS IN IMAGINATION HE SAW THE WELL-FILLED VAULT AND THE CREW OF THE CUTTER BEING MARCHED UP TO MAKE A SEIZURE AND ARREST HIS FATHER PERHAPS
AND IN THAT ATTITUDE HE RESTED FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS
NOBODY WOULD BE A BIT THE WISER AND YOU'D BE DOING A NEIGHBOUR A GOOD TURN I--I CANNOT MASTER SHACKLE
BUT THIS SOUND HEARD BY A LAD LIVING IN A GENERATION WANTING IN OUR MODERN ENLIGHTENMENT PARALYSED HIM
ARCHY HELD HIS BREATH AND FELT THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY THE FARMER HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH DRIVING HIM IN TO WORK FOR HE MADE NO FURTHER MOVEMENT AND THE COMING OUT OF THIS MAN AND ANOTHER WHO FOLLOWED DIRECTLY COMPLETELY REASSURED HIM
A MINUTE OR TWO LATER HE REALISED THAT HE WAS GOING UP HILL
SO STIFF WAS HE IN HIS MOVEMENTS THAT ANY ONE WHO WATCHED HIM WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THAT WAS ALL
NICE TO BE YOU HE SAID
FRIENDS INDEED
WAS IT A FOX'S HOLE THEN AND NOT A RABBIT'S GRIP THE DOG GROWLED AND BARKED
WOULDN'T HA BEEN NICE
NOW HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO HAVE UNDONE THE PAST
IT WAS SOME BUILDING AND THEN AS HE CROUCHED THERE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A PECULIAR ODOUR WHICH TOLD HIM NOT ONLY THAT THIS WAS A CELLAR BUT ONE IN WHICH BRANDY WAS STORED
ARE THOSE ROWLOCKS MUFFLED AY AY SIR SAID THE BOATSWAIN WHO WAS TO BE IN COMMAND OF ONE OF THE BOATS
BUT HE HAD HAD PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE IN CLIMBING ROPES AND MUTTERING DON'T LOSE YOUR NERVE HE GOT THE LINE WELL TWISTED ROUND HIS LEGS AND CLIMBED UP AGAIN SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO REPEAT HIS FORMER EXPERIMENT THIS TIME WITH SUCCESS AND HE STOOD UPON THE LEDGE AND LOOSELY KNOTTED THE ROPE ABOUT HIS WAIST TO GUARD AGAINST LETTING THE END GO BEFORE KNEELING DOWN TREMULOUSLY AND GETTING ONE HAND WELL IN UNDER THE COLLAR OF THE BOY'S ROUGH COAT
ARE THEY COMING UP TO-NIGHT MUSTN'T TELL SAID THE BOY SLOWLY
THE RATS
YAH I HATES HALF-BRED UNS
A DAY OR TWO ABOARD WILL MAKE HIM SPEAK THE COW WANTS TURNING OUT TO GRASS SHOUTED RAM
AND THEN TO HIMSELF STARBOARD LARBOARD FOR'ARD BACK'ARD AWK'ARD
DON'T STOP TO TALK
NEVER MIND I'LL SOON MAKE YOU CIVIL AGAIN
SHAN'T YOU BE THERE AND IF I COME ANY GAMES YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS AREN'T YOU
FOUR OF YOU WORK AND LOOSEN THE STONES THE OTHERS TAKE THEM AND THROW THEM BACK BELOW THE MEN CHEERED AND HEADED BY MR GURR AND DICK WORKED AS THEY HAD NEVER WORKED BEFORE
I'VE BEEN ASHAMED OF MYSELF EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE CUTTER
AND THANK YE FOR ME TOO MY LAD SO NOW TAKE MY ADVICE OPEN THAT DOOR AND SET ME FREE
EVENTUALLY THE MIDSHIPMAN ESCAPES THE SMUGGLERS ARE CAUGHT AND THE FARM-BOY BECOMES A SEAMAN ON THE EXCISE VESSEL
THE MIDSHIPMAN FELT SO ASSURED OF THIS THAT HE WHISPERED HIS BELIEF FREELY TO GURR AS HE ENCOUNTERED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME PERAMBULATING THE LINE OF MEN BUT THE OLD MASTER RECEIVED THE COMMUNICATION RATHER SURLILY
WELL THEN SHE SAID WHAT MAKES YOU SO CROSS CROSS
IN FACT IT SEEMED TO BE TURNING INTO POSITIVE DISLIKE ON ONE SIDE ARCHY FIERCELY RATING HIS GAOLER OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND RAM BEARING IT ALL IN THE MEEKEST WAY
GLAD YOU THINK SO WELL OF EM SIR
BEEN TO THE CLIFF EDGE I--YES MASTER SHACKLE SEE THE CUTTER I THINK I SAW A SMALL VESSEL LYING SOME DISTANCE OFF WITH WHITE SAILS THAT'S THE WHITE HAWK LUFF BROUGH
HAVE LIGHTS GOT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THEN WE CAN COME AND MAKE THEM PRISONERS ALL THIS WAS SAID IN A HURRIED WHISPER AS THE TWO STOOD TOGETHER IN FRONT OF THEIR MEN AND IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS FOR THEY HAD ADVANCED INTO THE PLACE FAR ENOUGH FOR THE FAINT LIGHT WHICH FILTERED DOWN FROM THE TRAP-DOOR TO BE COMPLETELY LOST
WITHOUT YOU WANT TO LEAVE ME SAID THE BOY LAUGHING
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE LITTLE BIT O FUN BEFORE WE GO BACK ABOARD
AFTER WAITING ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OUTSIDE THE FARM WITH HIS BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE ROUGHLY PILED-UP STONE WALLS OF THE DISTRICT ARCHY BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS VERY DULL AND HIS EXPECTATIONS OF A DISCOVERY OR AN ADVENTURE GREW LESS AND LESS
OF COURSE AS AN OFFICER YOU CANNOT SHRINK FROM YOUR DUTY BUT AS YOU ARE A MERE BOY IT IS NOT YOUR DUTY TO GO AND FIGHT AGAINST STRONG MEN WHO ARE SURE TO GET THE BETTER OF YOU BUT THEY ARE NOT ALL MEN THERE SIR SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN WITH A LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT GETTING HEAVIER IN HIS FACE
AND HE SPRANG UP AND RAPIDLY WASHED AND DRESSED TO HURRY UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
SLEEP HE SAID AS HE SAW ARCHY'S ATTITUDE
AHOY
AND IF HE DID JUMP HE COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT COMING DOWN IN CONTACT WITH THE BOY PERHAPS RIGHT ON HIM WHEN IT SEEMED AS IF A TOUCH OF A FINGER WOULD SEND HIM HEADLONG INTO THE SEA
NEARLY WASTED A LOT OF TIME AFRAID TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS LEST HE SHOULD YIELD TO THE TEMPTATION AGAIN AND FALL DEAD ASLEEP HE EAGERLY MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE SLOPE AND THE ROUGH STEPS TO STAND THERE WONDERING AS HE GOT TO THE TOP
LOOK HERE
I'M GOING NOW NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THE REMARK
FATHER SAYS YOU NEVER KNOW WHO MAY BE A SMUGGLER
I HAVE TO SEARCH THIS PLACE IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID THE WOMAN HUMBLY
WHEN YER KETCHES A WILD THING AND PUTS HIM IN A CAGE HE BEGINS TO BANG HISSELF AGEN THE SIDES AND KNOCKS HIS HEAD AGEN THE BARS AND IF HE COULD TALK HE'D GO ON JUST LIKE THAT ERE
I'LL LEAD THEM MYSELF AND WE'LL TRY AND SURPRISE THEM
THERE WAS A SOUND OF BREATH BEING DRAWN SHARPLY THROUGH THE TEETH AND THEN THE VOICE SEEMED CHANGED AS THE NEXT WORDS CAME DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS ARCHY WAS SILENT
WELL YOU WON'T GET OFF THIS WAY TILL YOUR WINGS GROW SAID RAM LAUGHING
FATHER ALLUS SAID I'D GOT THE THICKEST HEAD HE EVER SEE
WHILE JEMMY DADD THREW HIMSELF BACK ROLLED OVER ON TO HIS FACE AND LAUGHED HOARSELY
HE DID NOT THINK HE WOULD HAVE STRENGTH TO DRAW THE BOY UP AND IF HE DID HE WAS SO UNNERVED NOW THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DRAG HIM OVER THE EDGE ON TO THE ROCK PLATFORM
LET THEM BACK IN AND WE CAN TRY THE DEPTH WITH THE BOAT-HOOK THE ORDER WAS WHISPERED THE BOAT GLIDED IN THROUGH THE BROAD OPENING WAS TURNED QUICKLY AND THEN THE MEN BACKED WATER TILL TOLD TO STOP ARCHY WHO HAD THE BOAT-HOOK OVER THE SIDE SUDDENLY FINDING IT TOUCH THE SHINGLY BOTTOM AT THE DEPTH OF ABOUT A FOOT
THERE WAS A FAINT HISS AND AWAY RAN THE MAN AGAIN BRINGING THE NEXT TWO KEGS UP RAPIDLY TO BE SET AT LIBERTY SLUNG AND HOISTED ON ANOTHER MAN'S BACK AS THE HAULER CAME BACK OUT OF THE FOG
SHAKE HANDS CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT
BEFORE THE POWDER KETCHES POWDER SAID ARCHY IN AN AWE-STRICKEN WHISPER
WELL IT IS PRECIOUS DARK SAID ANOTHER
HULLO BEG PARDON SIR BEGAN THE MIDSHIPMAN
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO FACE MR BROUGH
THEN HANDS SEIZED HIM AND HE WAS THROWN DOWN ON THE GRASS WHILE THE LAST ROPE WAS CAST OFF
WHY DON'T YOU COME YOUNGSTER CRIED RAM MOCKINGLY AS HE HELD THE LANTHORN MORE CLOSELY
I'M READY LAD
HAVE HE RUNNED AWAY ARE YOU SURE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM MY LAD GROWLED GURR
YOU SEE I AM ONLY A YOUNG OFFICER QUITE A BOY AND WAS SENT ON THIS UNPLEASANT DUTY GO ON SIR GO ON OH NO CRIED THE LAD
AND DADD IS GOING TO COUNT THE SHEEP
OH IT WAS A CRY OF RAGE AS MUCH AS OF ALARM FOR THERE FOLLOWING HIS TRACK EXACTLY WAS RAM WHO HAD RETURNED REPENTANT ALONE WITH HIS BASKET TO MISS HIS PRISONER SEARCH FIND THE OPENING AND WITHOUT HESITATION TO COME DOWN THE CLIFF IN PURSUIT
YOUR CUTTER WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM THOUGH
NOW BOY THIS WAY RAM LOOKED VACANTLY ABOUT HIM BUT THERE WAS A VERY KEEN TWINKLE ABOUT HIS EYES AS HE FOLLOWED ARCHY FORWARD TO WHERE THE COW STOOD BLINKING HER EYES AND SWINGING HER TAIL AMONGST THE MEN
THE PERIL OF SUCH A RUN DOWN WOULD HAVE APPEARED THE GREATER COULD HE WHO DESCENDED HAVE SEEN HOW THE ROPE WAS ALLOWED TO RUN
IT--WILL BE A GLORIOUS DESPATCH RAYSTOKE
THE REEF THAT STRETCHED OUT FROM A POINT AND FORMED THE RACE WHERE THE TIDE STRUCK AGAINST THE SUBMERGED ROCKS AND THEN RUSHED OUT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE SHORE HAD BEEN PASSED AND THE CUTTER WAS STEERED ON AGAIN THROUGH THE CLEAR DARK NIGHT SLOWLY DRAWING NEARER THE DARK SHORE LINE TILL SHE WAS WELL IN UNDER THE CLIFFS
HE RETURNED AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY UNABLE TO HEAR A SOUND AND PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEY-HOLE OF THE DOOR TO LISTEN THERE
THEY'LL FIND OUT EVERYTHING NOW P'R'APS NOT MISSUS
CALL THIS LOVELY
THE LADY SHOOK HER HEAD
AND SO THE UNLOADING WENT ON WITH MARVELLOUS RAPIDITY THE HAULER RUSHING OFF INTO THE FOG A COUPLE OF KEGS COMING UP INTO SIGHT BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE LOOPS SLUNG AND HOISTED JUST AS THE HAULER CAME BACK AND THE BEARER DISAPPEARED TILL QUITE A LINE OF MEN WERE TRUDGING SLOWLY UP THE HILL DOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND UP AGAIN TOWARD SIR RISDON GRAEME'S OLD HOUSE THE HOZE TILL ALL THE BEARERS WERE GONE AND THE KEGS STILL KEPT COMING UP OUT OF THE FOG
WE MUST KEEP MOVING SO COME ON THEY TRUDGED ON FOR HOW LONG THEY COULD NOT TELL BUT BOTH WERE GETTING EXCEEDINGLY WEARY AND AS IGNORANT NOW EVER AS TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS
HOW HELP ME TO ESCAPE THE BOY LAUGHED
IF HE RAN IT WOULD LOOK COWARDLY AND HE KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE DOG WOULD COME AFTER HIM AND TAKE HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE
FOR IF THE LANDING HAD BEEN HURRIED AND THE DANGER NEAR THE THINGS WERE OFTEN CARRIED UP TO THE HOZE FOR TEMPORARY DEPOSIT TILL CARTS CAME TO BEAR THE THINGS INTO THE INTERIOR
THERE SHE GOES AGAIN
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY NANDY'S LOBSTER-BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY
AIN'T SEEN A DESERTER MISSUS HAVE YOU
BIT OF A REST
I HAVE GIVEN MR GURR FULL INSTRUCTIONS
I TELL YOU NO CRIED ARCHY
SHE COULDN'T HAVE LANDED THERE NONSENSE CRIED ARCHY ANGRILY
I CAN LAUGH AND FLEER AT YOU NOW
I'LL BE BOUND TO SAY IT IS RAM AND THAT BIG SCOUNDREL
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL HIS THOUGHTS STRIVE HOW HE WOULD
WHAT'S THE GOOD O BEING OBSTINATE
BE SMART DICK TURNED GLANCED WISTFULLY AT ARCHY SHAKING HIS HEAD AT HIM REPROACHFULLY SIGHED AND TAKING THE BUCKET AGAIN HE LOOKED INTO IT WITH HIS RUGGED BROWN FACE FULL OF DESPAIR
HAVE BIG TOM DUNLEY BADSTOCK AND TWO MORE AND BE YONDER AT DARK
BUT TELLING HIMSELF THAT THE BOY WAS AN ENEMY HE PUNISHED HIMSELF AS SOON AS THE LANTHORN CAME SWAYING THROUGH THE DARKNESS BY THROWING HIMSELF DOWN AND TURNING AWAY HIS HEAD
WHERE IS IT DESPERATE NOW IN HIS FIX AND FEELING THAT HIS ONLY RESOURCE TO KEEP RAM FROM SEARCHING FOR THE BASKET WITH HIS LANTHORN WAS TO KEEP UP THIS SHOW OF ANGER ARCHY MADE A SNATCH AT A LONG SPLINTER OF STONE AND STARTED UP MENACINGLY
IT HAD BEEN A TERRIBLE WALK IN THE DARKNESS FOR THE CLIFF TOPS WERE AS IF A GIGANTIC STORM HAD TAKEN PLACE WHEN THAT PART OF THE COAST WAS FORMED AND A SERIES OF MOUNTAINOUS--REALLY MOUNTAINOUS--WAVES HAD RUN ALONG AND BECAME SUDDENLY CONGEALED LEAVING SHARP-CRESTED HILL AND DEEPLY GROOVED VALLEY WHICH HAD TO BE CLIMBED AND DESCENDED IN TURN TILL THE MEN VOWED THAT THE DISTANCE WAS DOUBLE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BY ROAD AND THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT EXAGGERATING MUCH
I SAY YOU HE CONTINUED TURNING TO ARCHY WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HER NOW THANK YOU REPLIED ARCHY
IT'S ONLY GETTING OUT THE FIRST ONE HE ARGUED
SUNDRY FAMILIAR SOUNDS AROSE FROM TIME TO TIME AND MORE THAN ONCE THE FARMER UTTERED AN EJACULATION FULL OF IMPATIENCE AT THE LENGTH OF TIME TAKEN UP IN BRINGING THE VESSEL BELOW AND TAKING PRECAUTIONS TO KEEP HER FROM GRINDING AND BUMPING AGAINST THE EDGE OF THE SHELF FOR THOUGH THE SEA WAS CALM THERE WAS THE SWELL TO CONTEND WITH
HERE RAYSTOKE COME DOWN INTO THE CABIN AT ONCE CHAPTER TEN
ALL RIGHT DICK MY MAN SAID THE YOUNG OFFICER
HERE LET'S GO AND TELL THE SKIPPER SO
SO MAKING A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY HE WHIPPED OUT HIS DIRK AND RAN HARD AT THE DOG WHO CHECKED HIS PACE HESITATED STOPPED BARKED MORE FURIOUSLY THAN EVER AND THEN TURNED ROUND AND WAS CHASED BY THE MIDSHIPMAN WHO DREW UP ON FINDING HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH SIR RISDON'S DAUGHTER OUT FOR HER DAILY WALK
THAT'S WHAT YOUR SON SAID MY SON
THERE WERE TWO FLIGHTS TO DESCEND AND THE FIRST TOOK A LONG TIME
IN OTHER WORDS HE CAME DOWN FROM PISTOLS AND SHARP-EDGED CUTLASSES TO FISTS AND FELT SUCH AN INTENSE LONGING TO GET AT RAM THAT HIS FISTS INVOLUNTARILY CLENCHED AND HIS FINGERS TINGLED
OH HOW VEXATIOUS
THAT'S ALL CRIED MR GURR
AND SWINGING THE LANTHORN AS HE ROSE HE CONTINUED YOU'LL FIND THE ROAD TO YOUR MOUTH I DARESAY
LOOKS COMF'TABLE ENOUGH AS YOU ARE
GIVE HIM YOUR PAW CRIED THE GIRL
HER FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO GO TO HER FATHER BUT SHE SHRANK FROM DOING THIS AS HER MOTHER WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP AND IN HER DELICATE STATE THE ALARM MIGHT SERIOUSLY AFFECT HER
TOO LATE NOW HE RAN OFF LAUGHING AND HOLDING THE LANTHORN DOWN LOW TO MAKE SURE OF HIS WAY
OF THE PAIR ARCHY RAYSTOKE WAS A LITTLE THE BIGGER BUT THE SMUGGLER'S SON FULLY MADE UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCY BY HIS ACTIVITY AND THE HARDENING HIS MUSCLES HAD UNDERGONE FOR YEARS
WHY IT'S HIGH TREASON FOR A NAVAL OFFICER TO LET ONE MAN SLIP AWAY AND HERE YOU HAVE LET TWO BOATS CREWS GO
YOU MAY GET HOLD OF ME ANYWHERE IF YOU LIKE SAID THE BOY AND GIVE A HAND
IN SOME WAYS THIS BOOK IS REMINISCENT OF THE LOST MIDDY BY THE SAME AUTHOR BUT I SUPPOSE THAT WITH A SIMILAR THEME A NOSEY MIDSHIPMAN TAKEN PRISONER BY A GANG OF SMUGGLERS THERE ARE BOUND TO BE OTHER POINTS OF SIMILARITY
I COME TO SEE WHAT WAS AMISS RAM BOY YOU WAS SO LONG
THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES I DO SAID SIR RISDON STERNLY
NOT SO GOOD AS LINCOLNSHIRE COAST I SUPPOSE AS GOOD SIR
HALT SAID THE MASTER SUDDENLY AND THEN IN A WHISPER TO HIS GUIDE STRIKES ME AS THEY'LL HAVE THE BEST OF IT IF THEY SHOULD FIGHT MY LAD NOT MUCH REPLIED ARCHY
ALL HE COULD TELL FOR CERTAIN WAS THAT THE SMUGGLERS HAD BEEN ALARMED AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT REMOVE THE CARGO THAT NIGHT FOR ALL AT ONCE HE HEARD THE SHARP SNAP OF A GREAT LOCK BENEATH HIS FEET
I JOINED IN THE CHASE AND I TRIED TO GET THE BOYS TOGETHER BUT THEY SCATTERED EVERYWHERE BUT IT REALLY IS AWKWARD MR RAYSTOKE ISN'T IT HORRIBLY SIR
HE GLANCED DOWN AGAIN AND THEN BREATHLESS AS HE WAS RAN ON OVER THE DOWN-LIKE HILLSIDE TILL HE REACHED THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD SEEN RAM'S RED CAP DISAPPEAR AND HERE HE STOPPED TO MAKE SURE OF MR GURR SEEING THE DIRECTION HE HAD TAKEN STANDING WELL UP WITH HIS SWORD RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE
THERE WAS A LEANING TOWARD THE ROUGH LAD WHO SEEMED NEVER WEARY OF TRYING TO PERFORM LITTLE ACTS OF KINDNESS FOR HIS FATHER'S PRISONER
A BANG AS IF SOME ONE HAD STRUCK THE BULKHEAD WITH HIS ELBOW AND THEN A VOICE ROARED LOOK HERE SIR IF YOU DON'T BE OFF AND LET ME FINISH MY SLEEP I'LL LET GO AT YOU THROUGH THE DOOR
HERE MY MAN FETCH THAT BOY ON DECK RAM CAME UP WHISTLING SOFTLY AND LOOKING SHARPLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
THEY WON'T SHOW FIGHT
HOW DO SIR RISDON THE SPEAKER WAS A CURIOUS-LOOKING MAN OF FIFTY ROUGH SUNBURNED AND EVIDENTLY AS KEEN AS A WELL-WORN KNIFE
IT'S A BULLOCK OR A COW WERRY LIKE SIR
WOULDN'T DO FOR ME TO BE FRAID OF NO DOGS THE GIRL HALF TURNED AWAY BUT HER EYE CAUGHT THE BASKET
THIS WAY ALL RIGHT MATE
IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO TALK I CAN'T MAKE YOU ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN SO AS TO KEEP UP THE IDEA OF HIS LONGING TO BE SET FREE AND CHASE ANY SUSPICIONS OF HIS HAVING DISCOVERED A WAY OUT
NO MR RAYSTOKE IT'S ONLY OUR OLD BAD LUCK AND COMMON SENSE SAYS IT'S OF NO USE TO FIGHT AGAIN IT MR GURR SAID ARCHY EXCITEDLY SPEAKING WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE SAILING-BOAT
BUT WHEN THAT WAS OVER HE FELT PUZZLED AT RAM NOT COMING
BETTER BE OFF AT ONCE
YES I DO HATE THESE JOBS SAID THE MASTER AFTER A LONG SILENCE
WELL WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU DIRTY DICK SCREWED UP HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK BUT ONLY STARED
THEY THINK YOU DO THE WORK SO WELL THAT THEY WILL NOT REMOVE YOU FROM THE STATION NO SAID THE LIEUTENANT SADLY
THERE WAS ANOTHER ROAR OF LAUGHTER AND THE LIEUTENANT BADE DICK TRY AGAIN
DOWN CAME THE FARMER'S FIST ON THE TABLE MAKING THE PLATES AND BASINS JUMP
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE UNFORTUNATE COW WAS STANDING DRIPPING ON DECK
NEVER MIND MY LAD SAID THE MASTER GOOD-HUMOUREDLY
THERE HE WAS SAYING TAKE YOUR COW AND GO ASHORE
THERE MAY BE ONE THERE BUT IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN UPON IT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONE ARCHY LOOKED UP AT THE TOWERING PILE OF ROCK AND WAS OBLIGED TO OWN THAT HE WAS RIGHT
IT ISN'T A DREAM CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR
WELL DONE MR BROUGH WELL DONE CRIED GURR EXCITEDLY
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEARCH WITHOUT LIGHTS
YOU HAVE SEEN NO ONE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO LADY GRAEME
AND I DON'T THINK HE SAID YOU WAS TO SEND THAT PIECE OF PICKLED PORK MOTHER HE SAID CHICKENS DIDN'T HE SAID A CHICKUN CHICKEN MEANS CHICKENS CRIED MRS SHACKLE AND YOU CAN'T EAT CHICKEN WITHOUT PORK OR BACON
WANT ANY HELP
I WANT MY MEN
I FEEL AS IF WE'RE GOING WRONG HE SAID
MY CHIEF OFFICER LADIES
WHACK
WHACK
OF COURSE WELL-ARMED YES SIR
OH HOW I WILL PAY HIM OUT FOR THIS BY AND BY AREN'T YOU GOING TO PECK ARCHY TOOK NO NOTICE AND AT LAST THERE CAME IN A DEEP ECHOING GROWL THROUGH THE PLACE SAY LAD GOING TO BE ALL DAY COMING JEMMY RAM SHOUTED
PAIL'S FULL CRIED ARCHY
AND FEELING HOT WITH THE SUDDEN START HE TURNED AND CROUCHED DOWN BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND TO INDICATE THAT HE HAD BEEN HEARD AND DRAWING A LONG BREATH HE STEPPED ON TO REACH THE HARD EARTH WHERE HIS FEET WERE NOT AMONG THE WATER-WORN PEBBLES AND IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS ON THE ROAD HE HAD TRAVERSED TWICE THAT DAY AND WALKING FAST TOWARD THE FARM
AND SHE CALLED HIM LOUDLY BUT THERE WAS NO REPLY
THE NEXT DAY ARRIVED AND AS OF OLD RAM CAME WITH JEMMY DADD LEFT AT THE DOOR
THERE HAD NOT BEEN TIME FOR THEM--IF THOSE PEOPLE COMING WERE THE SMUGGLERS--TO FETCH THE CARGO AND THEY MUST BE COMING IN HIS DIRECTION
ARE YOU HURT NO SIR CAME UP FAINTLY
BEFORE HE COULD DRAW A BREATH OF RELIEF FEELING AS HE DID THAT THIS WAS NOTHING OF WHICH HE NEED FEEL SUCH FEAR THE VOICE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
THERE WERE NONE
COME HERE DIRECTLY
I'VE GOT MY DUTY TO DO AND I'LL DO IT
WAIT TILL I GET MY CHANCE HE MUTTERED
WOULDN'T IT STONISH THEM ALL
AND THEN IF I DON'T FIND MY WAY OUT OF THIS HOLE I'M AS STUPID AS THAT FELLOW THINKS STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM A BLOW AGAINST ANY OBSTACLE HE STALKED OFF IN AS STRAIGHT A DIRECTION AS HE COULD GO FEELING HIS WAY WITH HIS FEET AND ALWAYS MAKING SURE OF FIRM FOOTHOLD BEFORE HE MOVED THE ONE THAT WAS SAFE FOR HIS ONE GREAT DREAD IN THE VAST CAVERN WAS LEST HE SHOULD SUDDENLY FIND HIMSELF ON THE BRINK OF SOME YAWNING SHAFT
TOO ROUGH A JOB FOR YOU
BUT IN MY ANXIETY TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED TO CAPTURE SOME OF THESE SCOUNDRELS I WAS READY TO DO ANYTHING VERY TRUE SIR NOW MY GOOD FELLOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IT WAS ONLY AN OBSERVATION SIR THEN I MUST REQUEST THAT YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT AGAIN
TAK THY LEG OOT O THE BOOCKET MY BAIRN AND TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL PRESENT THE COW LIFTED HER LEG AND SET IT DOWN AGAIN ON DECK
BUT TO DICK'S GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TALLY UTTERED A SOFT LOW AND BEGAN TO SWING HER TAIL GENTLY ROUND SO AS TO GIVE JEMMY A PAT ON THE BACK
I DON'T WANT HIM TOOK PRISONER AGAIN IT'S ALL RIGHT MOTHER COME ALONG BOY ARCHY HEARD THE DEPARTING STEPS AND BEGAN TO SUFFER A FRESH AGONY OF SUSPENSE
HE STOPPED ONLY TO GAZE DOWN AT THE DAZZLING BLUE SEA AND THOUGHT THAT IF IT CAME TO THE WORST HE COULD LEAP RIGHT OFF INTO DEEP WATER AND THEN HE DREW HIMSELF RIGHT OUT ON TO A RUGGED LEDGE A FEW INCHES IN WIDTH AND STOOD HOLDING ON BY THE STONES ROUND THE OPENING LOOKING UPWARD FOR THE BEST WAY TO GET UP
SO LONG AS THEY COME OUT AND FIGHT FAIR I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY DO
AND I AM SURE THEY ARE HERE
WE HAVE PLENTY AT THE FARM AND IT WAS ON'Y DAY FORE YES'DAY AS I WAS OUT IN MY LITTLE LUGGER AND WE'D TOOK A LOT O MACKREL
FOR WHETHER THE DIRECTION THEY FOLLOWED WAS EAST WEST SOUTH OR NORTH THERE WAS NO INDICATION IN THE SKY
SHALL I FIRE A PISTOL TO MAKE A FLASH NO
GOT EM AT LAST CRIED GURR
TAKE THE BOAT AND--AH TO BE SURE
THERE'S NO ECHO LIKE AND IT SOUNDS SMOTHERED THEN ALOUD NOW THEN IS IT SURRENDER
EVER SEEN ANY ABOUT HERE WELL SAID RAM TAKING OFF HIS RED CAP AND SCRATCHING HIS CURLY HEAD I DESSAY I HAVE
NO THE MEN HAD NOT CAPTURED THE FUGITIVE BUT THEY WERE SURE IT WAS A BOY
I SAY HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE I GIVE YOU A PRETTY GOOD RUN LAST NIGHT DIDN'T I YOU YOUNG DOG GROWLED THE MASTER
I MUST GO STRAIGHT TO MY OFFICER AND TELL HIM AS SOON AS I GET OUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A SHARP BARKING FROM THE DOG WHO RUSHED UP THE STEPS TO STAND AT THE TOP FOR A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE COMING DOWN AGAIN
AND--I SAY YES TELL MOTHER I'M ALL RIGHT AND THAT I SHAN'T HAVE TO GO TO PRISON AND THAT I'LL GET SOME ONE TO TELL HER HOW I'M GETTING ON NOW AND THEN
THIS SOON RESOLVED ITSELF INTO FOUR KEGS SLUNG TWO AND TWO THE BEARER PANTING UNDER THEIR WEIGHT WHILE HIS COMPANION HELD THE LIGHT LOW DOWN SO THAT HE COULD SEE WHERE TO PLANT HIS FEET AND AVOID THE CORNERS OF THE HUGE SQUARE PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ROOF
IF HE GIVES ME ANY MORE OF HIS NONSENSE TOUCH HIM UP BEHIND WITH THE PYNTE OF YOUR CUTLASH AY AY SIR YAH
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR
YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE DECK
FOR THERE STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM WAS A PALE RAY OF LIGHT AND THE PLACE SMELT COOL AND FRESH
LIE DOWN MY LAD AND I'LL GO DOWN TOO SAID THE SAILOR IN A HUSKY VOICE WHICH TOLD OF THE HORROR HE FELT
AND THEN HE ROSE CAUTIOUSLY AND DROPPED DOWN AGAIN FOR THE DOOR WAS RE-OPENED AND THE LIGHT BEAMED OUT SO THAT THE WATCHER FELT THAT HE MUST BE SEEN
WHO BROUGHT THOSE COWS DOWN HERE JEMMY DADD HE'S A FOOL
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D DO ISN'T IT OF COURSE IT IS WELL THEN I CAN'T LET YOU GO
GO AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND DON'T BOTHER ME BANG
MAN CAN'T BE TWO THINGS AND IT LOOKS QUEER AN ARGUMENT WHICH DID NOT HAVE MUCH FORCE WHEN SELF-APPLIED FOR DICK SUDDENLY RECOLLECTED THAT HE WAS VERY SKILFUL WITH THE SCISSORS AND KNEW THAT HE WAS THE REGULAR BARBER OF THE CREW AND AS THIS CAME TO HIS MIND HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND GAVE HIS HEAD A VICIOUS SCRATCH
YOU DO HAVE TO PULL
WHERE AM I GOING NOW
BUT--TUT--TUT--TUT
HIS ARMS ACHED AND HIS FINGERS WERE SORE
AHOY A FAINT ECHO IN REPLY
BUT HE GOT ALONG OVER THE GROUND PRETTY WELL IN SPITE OF ITS SEEMING MORE HILLY AND ROUGH TILL AT THE END OF ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF HE FELT THAT HE MUST BE APPROACHING THE FARM AND HE ADVANCED MORE CAUTIOUSLY LISTENING FOR FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES FROM TIME TO TIME
GURR CONTINUED HIS SEARCH TILL IT WAS QUITE DARK AND THEN TRAMPED HIS MEN BACK TO THE COVE WHERE THE BOAT-KEEPER WAS SUMMONED AND THE BOAT WITH HER CREW SAVING DICK WERE SENT BACK TO THE CUTTER ONE OF THE MEN BEARING A MESSAGE FROM GURR TO SAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO STAY ASHORE TILL HE HAD FOUND MR RAYSTOKE AND ASKING THE LIEUTENANT TO SEND THE BOAT BACK FOR HIM IF HE DID NOT APPROVE
SO COME AND HAVE IT ENOUGH OF THIS CRIED ARCHY WRENCHING HIMSELF FREE
WHAT IS IT HE PANTED
FULL UP HERE
HE COULD SEE NOTHING
OH HOW TIRESOME SHE CRIED EXCITEDLY
SEE THAT CRIED ARCHY AS THE MEN BENT TO THEIR OARS AND MADE THE NOW PHOSPHORESCENT WATER FLASH
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
THEN THE PARTY MARCHED FOR THE FARM WHERE RED-EYED AND HER FLORID FACE MOTTLED AND TROUBLED-LOOKING MRS SHACKLE MET THEM
YOU DICK GIVE THE WORD YOURSELF TO LOWER AWAY AY AY SIR
THE MEN CAME TO TAKE AWAY THE BRANDY AND SILK AND I SAW THEM HERE SHE PRESSED HER HANDS TO HER TEMPLES FOR THE SURPRISE HAD CONFUSED HER AND IN ADDITION HER HEAD ACHED AND THROBBED
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
HE MUST SEE ME THOUGHT ARCHY
IT'S ON'Y A BIT OF A HOLE SIR AND THERE'S NOTHIN ELSE THE SEARCH WAS CONTINUED AND ENDED FOR THE LEDGE WAS SHUT IN BY THE MIGHTY WALL OF ROCK TOWERING ABOVE THEIR HEADS AND THE LIEUTENANT WAS SOON CONVINCED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO CLIMB THAT WITHOUT TACKLE FROM ABOVE
AND WRINKLING UP HIS BROW HE WENT ON MORE SATISFIED THAT HE HAD BEEN DELUDED AWAY SO AS TO GIVE THE CHASSE MAREE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN AND RAPIDLY RUN HER CARGO
MIND JUST AS THE SEA'S OFF THE LEDGE
I'VE GOT A BIT O LOVELY TOBACCO AT MY PLACE AND A LENGTH OR TWO OF FRENCH SILK MASTER SHACKLE
THE BOAT WAS ROWED QUICKLY BACK PAST WHERE THE PRISONERS SAT CONTENTEDLY ENOUGH
IT'S BECAUSE I AM SO STOUT
CHEERED BY HIS CALCULATION BEING SO FAR RIGHT HE WORKED AND SCRAPED OUT THE MORTAR SATISFIED EVEN WITH GETTING AWAY THE TINIEST SCRAPS FEELING AS HE DID THAT IF HE COULD ONLY DISLODGE ONE STONE HE COULD BRING UP FROM BELOW PLENTY OF GREAT AND SPLINTER-SHAPED PIECES WITH WHICH HE COULD HAMMER AND TAKE OUT THE REST OR ENOUGH FOR HIS BODY TO PASS THROUGH
WE'LL LAY HIM DOWN TO HAVE A NAP SOMEWHERE YONDER DOWN BELOW
I SWEAR IT SIR
THEY MAY BE HIDING BEHIND THE PILLARS OR PILES OF STONE
BE A GOOD THING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE SEARCHED WITH HIS FEET AND MADE SURE OF HIS FOOTING IF ONE COULD LEAVE ALL ONE'S THOUGHTS BEHIND AT A TIME LIKE THIS OR ONLY KEEP ENOUGH TO THINK WHERE TO PUT ONE'S FEET GLAD I HAVEN'T GOT ON MY UNIFORM HE SAID A FEW MOMENTS LATER AS HIS BREAST SCRAPED OVER THE ROUGH ROCK
THE MEN STOOD WHITE AND AWE-STRICKEN EXPECTING THE CLIFF TO CRUMBLE AWAY BENEATH THEM BUT SAVE THAT A STREAM OF FIRE ROARED OUT OF THE OPENING ALL WAS NOW STILL
TOUCHED HIM
IT WAS A VERY FAINT HOPE AND ONE HE FELT NOT LIKELY TO BE REALISED AND HE RETURNED ONCE MORE TO THE WINDOW WITH THE INTENTION OF RESUMING HIS TASK WHEN HE HEARD THE BUSHES PRESSED ASIDE BY SOME ONE COMING AND DIRECTLY AFTER THE BARS WERE SEIZED AS BEFORE
DIMLY SEEN ABOUT HIM WAS A GROUP OF A DOZEN MEN WHOSE FACES LOOKED MYSTERIOUS AND STRANGE AND THIS WAS ADDED TO BY THE SILENCE FOR ONLY ONE SPOKE AND HE WHEN HE WAS ADDRESSED FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES AFTER RAM'S ARRIVAL AMONG THEM EVERY ONE THERE BEING LISTENING ATTENTIVELY FOR THE DISTANT BEAT OF OARS
AND THEN SO AS NOT TO PUT HIM OUT WHEN YOU AGREED WITH HIM HE FLEW OUT AT YOU AND CALLED YOU A FOOL AND SAID HE WAS SURE THE SMUGGLERS HAD MURDERED HIS OFFICER OR ELSE TUMBLED HIM OFF THE CLIFF ARCHY WAS TOO WEARY WITH EXCITEMENT TO CARE TO TALK MUCH AND HE TRAMPED ON WITH THE MEN HARDLY ABLE TO REALISE THE TRUTH OF HIS ESCAPE AND HALF EXPECTING TO WAKE UP IN THE DARKNESS AND FIND IT ALL A DREAM
OH DON'T YOU
THERE WERE OATHS FIERCE CRIES AND THE STRUGGLING GREW HOTTER TILL ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A RUSH ARCHY WENT DOWN LIKE A SKITTLE MEN SEEMED TO PERFORM A TRIUMPHAL WAR-DANCE UPON HIS BODY AND THEN THEY PASSED ON WITH THE FIGHT EVIDENTLY CONSISTING OF A RETREAT AND PURSUIT TILL THE SOUNDS NEARLY DIED AWAY
SKIN'S WORTH A FEW SHILLINGS
PERHAPS ON BOARD SOME SHIP TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY AND HE BRIEFLY EXPLAINED HIS LATE POSITION AS THEY WALKED STEADILY ON THE MEN LISTENING EAGERLY THE WHILE
AGAIN HE FELT A STRANGE SENSATION OF MISERY
I SAY JEMMY SHE'D STAND IN THE BOAT WOULDN'T SHE
WON'T DO HE SAID FIRMLY AS HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND TRIED TO LOOK STERN AND TALL AND BIG AN IMPOSSIBILITY WITH A MAN OF FIVE FEET TWO INCHES IN HEIGHT AND WHOSE PHYSIQUE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST HIS ADVANCE IN THE PROFESSION
I SHALL NEVER BE LIFTED NOW MR BROUGH WAS WRONG FOR TWO YEARS LATER HE WAS APPOINTED TO A FRIGATE AND HIS FIRST EFFORTS WERE DIRECTED TO GETTING ARCHY RAYSTOKE AND RAM BERTHS IN THE SAME SHIP WHERE A LONG AND SUCCESSFUL CAREER AWAITED THEM
THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL ABOUT HIS PRISON TO MAKE HIM LAUGH BUT THE REACTION WAS SO GREAT--HE FELT SO DIFFERENT AFTER HIS HEARTY MEAL THAT HE WAS READY TO LOOK ANY DIFFICULTY IN THE FACE AND FULL OF WONDER AT HIS DESPONDENCY OF A SHORT TIME BEFORE
FOR HE WANTED TO TALK TO RAM ABOUT THEIR ADVENTURES AND TO TRY WHETHER HE COULD NOT WIN OVER THE BOY TO HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
I CAN'T HEAR THEM ANYWHERE NOR I SIR WELL WE MUST NOT STAND HERE
HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE OTHER SLOPE AND SHOUTED HI JEMMY!--SMUGGLER
I S'POSE YOU MEAN IT BUT YOU'LL LET IT OUT AGAIN SOON AS YOU FORGET NO I WILL NOT DICK
BECAUSE SHE'LL HAVE TO COME AND TAKE US OFF
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU'LL GRANT THAT THE PEOPLE ABOUT HERE WOULD NOT BE ABOVE A BIT OF SMUGGLING SIR RISDON WAS SILENT
IT'S THE FARMER AND HIS MAN THOUGHT THE LISTENER
THEN HEAR SEE AND SAY NOTHING MY LAD CRIED HIS MOTHER
SLEEP STILL NO ANSWER
IF THEY SHOW FIGHT YOU COME ON NEXT BO'S'N WITH THE WHOLE OF YOUR BOAT'S CREW AY AY SIR HI
I OUGHT TO HAVE BROUGHT A BASKET FOR SOME BLACKBERRIES SHE FELT FULL OF SELF-REPROACH AS SHE RECALLED HOW PLENTIFULLY THEY GREW THERE AND HOW USEFUL THEY WOULD BE AT HOME
FOR TWO PINS SIR,--WOMEN'S PINS SIR NOT BELAYING PINS,--I'D HAVE YOU PUT ASHORE WITH ORDERS NOT TO SHOW YOUR DIRTY FACE AGAIN TILL YOU HAD FOUND MR RAYSTOKE DIRTY DICK PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FACE CAREFULLY AND THEN LOOKED AT THE PALM TO SEE IF ANY OF THE SWARTHY TAN HAD COME OFF
SURELY THEY WOULD NOT KILL ME A COLD CHILL SHOT THROUGH HIM BUT HE MASTERED THE FEELING OF TERROR AS HE FELT HIMSELF DRAGGED TO HIS FEET
BACK TO YOUR PLACES EVERY ONE HE SAID
THE MAN GAVE HIS OFFICER AN APPEALING LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO SAY TELL ME TO BOARD THE ENEMY SIR AND I'LL GO BUT DON'T ASK ME TO DO THIS COME
THEN CAME RELIEF
CHUCK YOU OFF THE CLIFF
THEY WON'T COMPLAIN
AT LAST HE VENTURED
OH YES I MEAN LIKED HIS JOB YES SIR
BAH
YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME A TOPPER WITH A STONE AND RUN AWAY
IF WE CAN BE TOGETHER MR RAYSTOKE I SHALL BE DELIGHTED THAT SAME NIGHT AS HE WAS THINKING ABOUT RAM SHACKLE ARCHY WENT UP TO THE LIEUTENANT WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN RUBBING HIS HANDS
NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD-FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE
FATHER AND MOTHER SENT THIS HERE
GOT HALF WAY HOME FIRST THOUGH
OH HE MENTALLY EJACULATED AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS LONG SOJOURN IN THE CAVE AND A FEELING OF SATISFACTION CAME OVER HIM THAT IT WAS DARK
THERE'S NO FIGHT IN THEM
HALF AN HOUR AFTER A DIRTY-LOOKING SAILOR LAD SLIPPED DOWN INTO THE BOAT WITH HIS WORSTED CAP PULLED WELL DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING ABOUT HIS CHEST AS HE SAT BACK IN THE STERN-SHEETS BY GURR THE MASTER
IT'LL BE A FOG AGAIN TO-NIGHT HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY AND SHE'S SURE TO COME
LOTS O BOYS ABOUT SOON GET ANOTHER THE MAN WENT CLUMPING ON DECK AND STEPPED OVER THE SIDE INTO HIS BOAT
OH I KNOW
AND FEELING ANNOYED AT THE TROUBLE IT GAVE HIM MR BROUGH WENT AFT AGAIN TO NOTICE NOW THAT THERE WAS NO MAN AT THE HELM
NOW JUST HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY FORGETTING ALL THE DISCIPLINE YOU HAVE BEEN TAUGHT AND LEADING THESE POOR CHAPS OFF ON SUCH A WILD-GOOSE CHASE I MR GURR SAID ARCHY IN ASTONISHMENT
DON'T SEEM ANY GOOD TO GO SEARCHING ALONG AGAIN IN THE DARK MR RAYSTOKE SAID THE MASTER
BUT WE ARN'T GOT THE PRIZE YET AND IT'S MY BELIEF AS WE SHAN'T GET IT WHY BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME AS THERE'S SOMETHING NOT ALL RIGHT ABOUT THESE HERE CRAFT OF COURSE THERE IS THEY ARE SMUGGLERS YES SIR AND WORSE TOO
ALL WAS VERY QUIET AT THE FARM SO QUIET THAT HE DETERMINED AT LAST TO GO AND PEER IN AT THE WINDOW TO SEE IF THE FARMER WAS LIKELY TO COME OUT AGAIN BECAUSE IF THIS WERE NOT SO HE WAS WASTING HIS TIME
BUT AT EVERY MOVEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF MORE TIGHTLY HELD AND KNOWING FROM SAD EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS WASTE OF ENERGY TO CONTEND WITH THE IRON-MUSCLED FELLOW WHO GRIPPED HIS ARM HE SMOTHERED HIS ANGER
HE AREN'T HERE WHO IS NOT HERE
WHY OF COURSE HE COULD NOT HAVE GOT IN THERE TO WATCH OR THE MEN WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM COME IT IS VERY EASY TO PLACE FAITH IN THAT WHICH YOU WISH TO BELIEVE
HERE AGAIN HE WAS UTTERLY AT FAULT FOR THE CAVERN WAS SO BIG AND IRREGULAR AND HE WAS STILL SO HAUNTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE AT ANY MOMENT ON THE BRINK OF SOME DEEP HOLE HALF FULL OF WATER THAT HE DARED NOT SEARCH SO ENERGETICALLY AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED
SUPPOSE WE DID GO AND RANSACKED THE PLACE AND HURT EVERYBODY'S FEELINGS AND THEN FOUND NOTHING WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK LIKE THEN SILLY SAID THE MASTER LACONICALLY AND FOR A TIME HE WAS SILENT MARCHING ON BEHIND THE MEN
AND TO HERSELF,--"THAT'S QUITE TRUE YOU ARE VERY HOSPITABLE SAID ARCHY SHORTLY
HALLO SHALL WE JUMP OVER AND SWIM ASHORE NAY
TILL AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR RAM REAPPEARED WHEN THE BUSINESS OF CLOSING AND BOLTING THE DOOR WENT ON WHILE JEMMY BLEW OUT THE LIGHT CLOSED THE LANTHORN THROUGH WHOSE CREVICES CAME FORTH AN UNPLEASANT ODOUR BORE IT BACK TO ITS HIDING-PLACE
THE HALT WAS CALLED AND THE YOUNG OFFICER CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY DICK WENT QUICKLY TO THE SPOT FROM WHENCE THE CRY HAD COME
THE DOOR CLOSED WITH A SOFT DULL SOUND AS ARCHY STOOD AS IF TURNED INTO STONE HIS HAIR AGAIN FEELING AS IF MOVED BY HANDS AND HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN BUT NO WORDS WOULD COME
I'VE SEEN UN TIMES ENOUGH YES YES
MR RAYSTOKE CAPTAIN CALLING YOU SIR SAID A RUGGED-LOOKING SAILOR WITH A VERY SWARTHY FACE THAT LOOKED AS IF IT WOULD BE ALL THE BETTER FOR A WASH BUT ONLY SEEMED
WHAT CHUCKED HIM OFF YONDER GURR GLANCED ROUND TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE LOOKING AND THEN SAID RATHER HUSKILY BUT KINDLY IN ORD'NARY DICK MY LAD NO
ANOTHER HOUR AND YOU MAY BE OFF
I'VE HEARD TELL AS THEY LAND EM ALL ALONG THE CLIFF HERE BAH
I KNOW WHAT I'M BOUT THAT BEING SO MRS SHACKLE MADE NO REMARK BUT WENT ON CUTTING CHUNKS OF BREAD AND BUTTER FOR HER SON TO WHICH THE BOY ADDED PIECES OF COLD SALT PORK AND THEN TURNED HIMSELF INTO A MILL WHICH WENT ON SLOWLY GRINDING UP MATERIAL FOR THE MAKING OF A MAN THIS RAW MATERIAL BEING DULY MANIPULATED BY NATURE AND APPORTIONED BY HER FOR THE FUTURE MAKING OF THE HUMAN MILL
IT HAS FALLEN TO THE LOT OF SOME PEOPLE TO BE LOST IN A FOG--WORDS THESE WHICH CAN ONLY BE APPRECIATED BY THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED THROUGH A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE
AH YOU ALWAYS WERE A ONE TO YEAT SIR EVER SINCE YOU FIRST CAME ABOARD YOU'RE A NOODLE DICK
MY LADS STEADY CRIED THE MASTER--"KEEP STROKE AND THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS AS TO HIS FIRST PROCEEDINGS ON GETTING ASHORE
GOT ANYTHING TO EAT TO EAT
BUT WHEN SMUGGLERS FINDS THEMSELVES UP IN CORNERS WHERE THEY CAN'T GET AWAY THEY TURNS AND FIGHTS LIKE RATS AND WHEN THEY FIGHTS THEY BITES AH EJACULATED DICK SADLY
AND THEN HE STOPPED SHORT FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NOT COME UPON THE CLUSTER OF HOUSES WHERE THE PEOPLE SMILED AND NODDED AT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY PASSED
I LIKED THAT CHAP SAID RAM AS HE GAZED ACROSS A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF SMOOTH WATER AT WHERE ARCHY SAT IN HIS UNIFORM STEERING
EH EXCLAIMED RAM STARING
CAN'T BREATHE SLIT THE BACK OF THE SACK LAD SAID THE SAME GRUFF VOICE AND THERE WAS A SHARP CUTTING NOISE HEARD AS A BREATHING-HOLE WAS CUT RIGHT UP BEHIND HIS HEAD
HE OPENED HIS EYES AND THEN PUT HIS HANDS UP TO FEEL IF THEY WERE OPEN
THE NEST HAD BEEN BURNED OUT AND THE SMUGGLING IN THAT PART OF THE FREESTONE SHORE HAD RECEIVED SO HEAVY A BLOW THAT ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN CARED TO RETURN AND THEN ONLY FOR A TEMPORARY STAY
I DARESAY HE HAS BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME ONLY YOU TOOK UP MY ATTENTION WITH YOUR CHATTER HE SWUNG ROUND WALKED AFT AND BEGAN SWEEPING THE SHORE AGAIN WITH HIS GLASS WHILE THE MASTER AND DICK EXCHANGED GLANCES WHICH MEANT A GREAT DEAL
IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL GO TO PRISON AS SURE AS YOU'RE THERE
IT'S YOUR FAULT MY LADS AND VERY ONSENSIBLE
SUCH IMPUDENCE
BUT IT'S BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE YOU DO IT NO
YOU WILL SIR RISDON NO--NO I DARE NOT AND IT GIVES A NEIGHBOUR A CHANCE TO BEG YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF A LITTLE DROP O REAL COGNAC SIR RISDON--SO GOOD IN CASE O SICKNESS
DON'T ASK ME HE SAID SADLY
I AM A KING'S OFFICER AND YOU ARE ONLY A SMUGGLER'S BOY I CAN'T HELP THAT SAID RAM WARMLY
WHY DIDN'T I TRY THIS BEFORE HE CRIED
WHO'S THIS NO NO SIR CRIED ONE OF THEM
AND WE NEEDN'T QUARREL BOUT IT FOR IT STRIKES ME AS LITTLE MISSUS WON'T COME DOWN HERE NO MORE I SCARED HER TOO MUCH JEMMY BURST INTO ANOTHER HOARSE FIT OF LAUGHING AND WENT LUMPING OFF IN HIS BIG SEA-BOOTS TO SEE IF CELIA AND HER DOG WERE WELL OUT OF SIGHT BEFORE REJOINING RAM TO TAKE THE PRISONER HIS REPAST
WHERE DID YOU GET THE ROPE FROM CLOSE TO WHERE I SLEPT YES THERE WAS A LOT THERE
BUT NO PROMOTION MR RAYSTOKE HE CRIED
BUT THE DANGER NEVER OCCURRED TO RAM WHO HAD BEEN UP THESE CLIFF-PATHS TOO OFTEN FOR HIS PLEASURE TO HEED THE BREAKNECK NATURE OF THE ROUGH SHEEP-TRACK UP AND UP THE FACE OF THE CLIFF LEADING TO WHERE IT BECAME A STEEP SLOPE WHICH RAN IN AND ON SOME FOUR HUNDRED FEET FORMING ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
ALL BOUT DONE UP HE GROWLED
HAD HE TAKEN THE UPPER LANE IN THE DARKNESS AND SO MISSED THE MEN ON THE WATCH
THESE THOUGHTS WERE ALMOST ENOUGH TO STUN HIM AGAIN AND HE LAY THERE WITH A HOT SENSATION OF RAGE AGAINST THE TREACHEROUS YOUNG SCOUNDREL WHO HAD LURED HIM ON TO THAT STRUGGLE AND HELD HIM SO THOROUGHLY FIXED AGAINST THE BARS TILL HE WAS SECURED AND BOUND
LAY YOUR BACKS WELL INTO IT MY LADS SAID THE LIEUTENANT AND TRY AND LAND HIM WITHOUT BEING SEEN AY AY SIR CAME FROM THE MEN THE BOAT BEGAN TO SURGE THROUGH THE STILL WATER AND THE BOY TRIED TO SHIFT THE LION'S HEAD WHICH FORMED THE TOP OF HIS DIRK HANDLE
BUT THESE WERE TRIFLES NOW AND HE SEATED HIMSELF IN HIS OLD SPOT READY TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS AND SO FULL OF HOPE THAT HE COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM SHOUTING FOR JOY
HE COULD SHOW THE LIEUTENANT WHERE THE OPENING WAS IN THE CLIFF AND BY KNOWING THAT IT WOULD BE EASY TO TRACK OUT THE LAND ENTRANCE
SUCH LOTS OF GREAT CONGER EELS SIX FOOT LONG BOUT THE HOLES IN THE BOTTOM
FOR HIM HE SAID CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND THEN SUCH A PECULIARLY STRONG SUGGESTION OF ITS BEING DINNER-TIME REMINDED HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO PARTAKE OF FOOD THAT HE OPENED THE BASKET AND THE TEMPTATION WAS RESISTED NO LONGER
THIS HERE'S A SEA-COW SIR SARTIN IT'S A COW DICK
THEN SITTING DOWN AGAIN RATHER NERVOUSLY HE ONCE MORE PLACED THE VESSEL BETWEEN HIS LEGS STUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE COW'S SIDE AND PREPARED TO MILK
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS
IT GOES THROUGH ME LIKE A KNIFE ARCHY DREW A LONG BREATH AND WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE HIS MEN WHEN HE HEARD SOMETHING WHICH MADE HIM BOUND FORWARD FOR CELIA UNABLE TO BEAR THE HORROR AND ALARM ANY LONGER HAD SUDDENLY SWOONED AWAY
ARCHY'S TACTICS WERE OF COURSE TO PREVENT THIS AND RID HIMSELF OF HIS ADVERSARY AS HE FELT ALL THE TIME HOW HORRIBLY RISKY IT WAS TO STRUGGLE AND WRESTLE THERE FOR THE LEDGE WAS SIX FEET WIDE AT THE OUTSIDE AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN TWICE THE LENGTH
AND THEN THE MEN DREW OFF BECOMING INVISIBLE ALMOST DIRECTLY FOR THE DARKNESS WAS NOW INTENSE THE LANTHORNS CAREFULLY HIDDEN BELOW AND ONCE MORE ALL WAS STILL AND THE LITTLE OFFICE RESTED HIS GLASS ON THE BULWARK AND CAREFULLY SWEPT THE SEA
OH I GIVE YOU MY WORD SQUIRE THERE'S NOTHING HERE WE MUST SEE ABOUT THAT WELL THIS HERE ARN'T WERRY PLEASANT MR ORFICER SEEING AS I'M A REG'LAR LOYAL SERVANT OF THE KING
THEY'VE SHUT US IN BUT IF THEY WERE HERE CRIED THE MASTER
DOWN GRIP DOWN CRIED A PLEASANT VOICE AND A GIRL OF FIFTEEN CAME RUNNING OUT LOOKING BRIGHT AND ANIMATED WITH HER FLUSHED CHEEKS AND LONG HAIR
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
THE MIST GREW MORE DENSE AS THEY NEARED THE TOWERING CLIFFS
DOOR'S OPEN AND YOU MIGHT GET OUT ARCHY'S TEETH GRATED TOGETHER BUT HE SAID NOTHING ONLY BEGAN TO CLIMB FOLLOWING THE BOY PATIENTLY TILL THEY WERE NEARING THE OPENING WHEN HE STARTED SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE NEARLY LOST HIS HOLD
AND EXCITED AS THE MIDSHIPMAN WAS THESE IDEAS OCCURRED TO HIM WHILE RUNNING ALONG OVER THE TOP OF THE DOWN-LIKE CLIFF
THE QUIET LITTLE COVE WAS STILL A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY WHEN ARCHY SUDDENLY TOUCHED THE MASTER'S ARM AS HE SAT THERE HOLDING HIS CUTLASS
BETTER GO TO PRISON FOR SMUGGLING
BUT WERE YOU COMING TO SEE MY FATHER
AND BEFORE THEY HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR SURPRISE SEVERAL MEN ROSE UP OARS WERE THRUST OVER NOW THAT THE WIND HAD FAILED AND WITH EIGHT MEN PULLING THEY WERE GOING STRAIGHT FOR THE CLIFF
ON THE OTHER HAND THE STAVES OF THE BRANDY KEGS WERE FOR THE MOST PART HARDLY SCORCHED AND THE STONE FLOOR SHOWED NO TRACES OF FIRE HAVING PASSED
AND HAD IT BEEN DAYLIGHT THE PROBABILITIES WERE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN THESE RISKY SPOTS A WIDER BERTH
BUT IT'S OKKARD
I SAY I AM HUNGRY
HAVEN'T BEEN AT ONE OF THEM LITTLE KEGS HAVE YOU
LEAVE HIM IN THE DARK A BIT TO COOL HIM DOWN YOU SCOUNDRELS CRIED THE LAD IN FRENZY
AS IF I DIDN'T KNOW THAT CRIED THE LAD
THE PROOF WAS EASY
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO LIE STILL AND TRUST TO HIS NOT BEING SEEN WHEN THE NEXT MINUTES WERE MADE AGREEABLE BY A HOST OF RECOLLECTIONS REGARDING THE TREATMENT RECEIVED BY THOSE WHO BETRAYED SMUGGLERS OF THE DESPERATE FIGHTS THERE HAD BEEN HOW MANY HAD BEEN KILLED AND A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH THE LAD AS HE RECALLED THE STORY OF A MAN WHO HAD PLAYED THE SPY SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE SOUTH COAST BEING THROWN FROM A CLIFF AND LITERALLY SMASHED
THE WRONG PAW SIR SHE CRIED
PRAY PROCEED THE MIDSHIPMAN HESITATED AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER SEEING LADY GRAEME STANDING PALE HANDSOME AND STATUESQUE BY HER HUSBAND'S SIDE WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS CELIA HOLDING HER FATHER'S HAND AND RESTING HER FOREHEAD AGAINST HIS ARM
AND DRAWING BACK ONCE MORE THE MIDSHIPMAN BEGAN TO HURRY DOWN THE STEPS AND THEN THE SLOPE INTO THE BLACK QUARRY THAT HE HAD FANCIED HE HAD QUITTED FOR EVER
YOU MR RAYSTOKE AND FOUR MEN STOP BACK AND FORM THE RESERVE TO TAKE PRISONER ANY ONE WHO TRIES TO ESCAPE THE MEN DESCENDED TILL EVERY STEP WAS OCCUPIED THE LITTLE FORCE EXTENDING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
YOU'LL STOP ASIDE ME MR RAYSTOKE AND TRY AND GUIDE YES SIR YOU UNDERSTAND BO'S'N DOWN WITH THE FIRST WHO TRIES TO ESCAPE UP THE HOLE HERE AY AY THEN NOW FORWARD CRIED GURR
BE OFF ARCHY RAYSTOKE KNEW HIS COMMANDING OFFICER'S WAYS AND AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS HE SAID SOFTLY AFTER GIVING A TAP OR TWO ON THE PANEL SHALL I TAKE THE BOAT AND GET HER ABOARD THERE WAS A LOUD RUSTLE
THE WAY WAS OPEN TO HIM TO CLIMB UP OR LOWER HIMSELF DOWN APPARENTLY BUT HE CHOSE THE FORMER WAY OF ESCAPE KNOWING AS HE DID HOW VERY LITTLE AT THE BASE OF THE CLIFFS WAS LEFT BARE EVEN IN THE LOWEST TIDES AND THAT IF HE GOT DOWN HE WOULD EITHER HAVE TO SWIM OR TO SIT PERCHED UPON A SHELF OF ROCK TILL SOME BOAT CAME AND PICKED HIM OFF
I'M TOO LITTLE AND TOO FAT NO THAT'S NOT IT SAID ARCHY BOLDLY
NOT THE KING'S LAWS BUT THE LAWS OF THAT DUTCHMAN WHO HAS COME AND STUCK HIMSELF ON THE THRONE
THIS DONE HE TOOK DOWN A MUCH SMALLER LANTHORN PAINTED BLACK ALL ROUND LIT THE CANDLE WITHIN AND TAKING THIS ONE IN HIS HAND HE HUNG THE OTHERS OVER HIS SHOULDER AND PREPARED TO START
THIS WAS NOT THE DECK FOR HE COULD FEEL THAT HE WAS LYING ON WHAT WAS LIKE AN OLD SAIL AND WHERE HIS HAND LAY WAS NOT WOOD BUT COLD HARD STONE WITH A BIG CRACK FULL OF SMALL SCRAPS
DO YOU THINK I CAN GO BACK ON BOARD WITHOUT THEM
HOW DARE THEY HE CRIED PASSIONATELY
WISH I'D BEEN BEHIND THE MAN WHO FORGOT EM
THEN WE HAVE NOT MISSED THEM THOUGHT ARCHY AS THE MEN PULLED STEADILY ON WITH THE RUSHING PLUNGING NOISE OF THE WAVES BEGINNING TO BE HEARD AS THEY WASHED THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS
MANY OF THE MEN ENGAGED IN THE SMUGGLING ARE DESPERATE WRETCHES AND IF THEY FEARED BETRAYAL THEY WOULD NOT SCRUPLE I'M AFRAID TO STRIKE DOWN ANY ONE IN THE WAY OF THEIR ESCAPE LADY GRAEME SHUDDERED AND THEY WENT TOGETHER INTO THE HOUSE JUST AS CELIA CAME ACROSS THE WOOD AT THE BACK IN COMPANY WITH THE DOG
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE OTHER LITTLE BARRELS ARE WISH I DID GRUMBLED JEMMY
BUT HE COULD NOT DO THAT SO HE MADE AN EFFORT TO GO FORWARD AND WONDERED HOW SOON IT WOULD BE MORNING AND THE WINDOW CURTAINS AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WOULD SHOW STREAKS OF SUNSHINE BETWEEN
NOW WHO'LL VOLUNTEER TO LEAN OVER AND GET A GOOD GRIP OF HIM WHILE WE HOLD BY YOUR LEGS I WILL SAID DICK
YOU MUST ASK LEAVE SIR ASK WHO SAID RAM VACANTLY
HE WAS JUST IN TIME TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM ANOTHER FALL AS HE HEARD A DULL BANG AS IF A HEAVY DOOR WERE CLOSED FOLLOWED BY A CURIOUS RATTLING SOUND AS OF LARGE PIECES OF SLATE FALLING DOWN AND BANGING AGAINST WOOD
IT'S ON'Y ME MR GURR
HE LOOKED ROUND BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO MAKE OUT ANYTHING AND HE WAS ABOUT TO START ON AGAIN COMFORTING HIMSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT HE MUST BE RIGHT WHEN HE HEARD AT A DISTANCE THE PAT-PAT OF FEET ON HARD GROUND AND DREW BACK CLOSE UP TO THE SIDE TO STOOP DOWN AMONG SOME BRAMBLES WHICH TOLD HIM AT ONCE AFTER THEIR FASHION WHAT THEY WERE
HE HAS FOUND ME CRIED THE PRISONER EXCITEDLY
SEE HER SIR YES ANSWERED THE MIDDY WITH HIS GLASS AT HIS EYE
AND THEN PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE TASK HE BEGAN RESOLUTELY TO CLIMB UP THE FACE OF THE CLIFF WHERE HE HAD COME DOWN AND SETTING HIS TEETH HARD WENT FROM CRACK TO CREVICE AND LEDGE ON AND ON SEEING NOTHING BUT THE WHITE FACE BELOW HIM ON THE SHELF AND PRAYING THE WHILE THAT THE POOR LAD MIGHT NOT FALL BEFORE HE CAME BACK WITH HELP
BUT YOU'LL GO UP TO THE FARM EH YES I SHALL GO THERE AND UP TO THAT BIG HOUSE ARCHY WAS SILENT
GREAT COWARD
I'M OUT ON THE LEDGE
THE DOG SCENTED ME OUT AND WAS SCRATCHING THERE TILL THAT GREAT BRUTE OF A SMUGGLER SAW HIM AND THREW A STONE AND DROVE HIM AWAY
YOU'RE RIGHT LAD
PULL AWAY MY LADS LET'S GET ABOARD AND THE SKIPPER MAY JOIN IN
THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAEME HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE WHAT ELSE CAN I DO REPLIED ARCHY SADLY
THERE WE ARE
BEEN LOOKING AT THE CUTTER FATHER OH SHE DON'T WANT NO LOOKING AT
I SAY MIDSHIPMAN YOU HAVE GOT INTO GOOD QUARTERS YOU HAVE ARCHY TRIED TO SEEM SULKY
NO SIR CAME FROM ALL DIRECTIONS
IT WAS NOT THE LANTHORN BUT A ROUND CROSS-HANDLED BASKET WITH LID AND HE TREMBLED AS HE RECALLED RAM'S WORDS ABOUT WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SENT
MRS SHACKLE RAM TOLD ME TO TELL YOU HE WAS ALL RIGHT THANK HEAVEN SAID THE WOMAN WIPING AWAY A TEAR
AND IF HE IS A GOOD LAD WE SHALL MAKE A MAN OF HIM THEN YOU WILL SIR
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BEING FRIGHTENED
I SAY HE CRIED AGAIN ADDRESSING ARCHY IS THAT THING SHARP THE MIDSHIPMAN DID NOT CONDESCEND TO ANSWER BUT STOOD GAZING THOUGHTFULLY OVER THE SIDE TILL THE BOAT GRADUALLY SEEMED TO DIE AWAY IN THE FAINT MIST OF THE COMING NIGHT
ONE MOMENT THE KING'S MEN WERE ADVANCING CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE NEXT WITHOUT A SOUND TO WARN THEM THERE WAS A RUSH
SHE TRUDGED ON FOR ABOUT A MILE OVER THE THIN STONY PASTURES FOUND A FAIR NUMBER OF SMALL SWEET PINK-GILLED MUSHROOMS WHERE THE TURF WAS FINEST AND RICHEST AND GRADUALLY ADDING TO HER STORE OF GLISTENING BRAMBLE-BERRIES TILL HER FINGER-TIPS WERE PURPLE WITH THE STAINS
AND AS THE MASTER SPOKE THE MAINSAIL WAS RAPIDLY LOWERED THE JIB DROPPED AND THOSE IN THE WHITE HAWK'S LEADING BOAT SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF BUSY WORK ON BOARD
NOW YOUNGSTER ON WITH YOU
IF I DO THEY'LL COME DOWN AND STUFF A HANDKERCHIEF IN MY MOUTH AGAIN HE THOUGHT AND IT IS NO USE TO DO THAT
THE THOUGHT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM BEFORE THROUGH EVERY HOLE AND CORNER BEING SO FAMILIAR FROM THE FACT THAT SCORES OF TIMES HE HAD HELD THE LANTHORN WHILE HIS FATHER'S MEN CARRIED IN SMUGGLED GOODS LANDED AT THE LEDGE IF THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME
YES THAT'S RIGHT NANTES
IF THEY'RE GETTING AWAY COVER THEM WITH YOUR PISTOLS AND TELL EM THEY SHALL HAVE IT IF THEY DON'T SURRENDER THE EXCITEMENT WAS NOW TREMENDOUS
THEY'RE SUCH A SET OF FOXES ABOUT HERE THAT SHE MIGHT HE SHADED HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND AND TOOK A LONG LOOK AT HER AND ONCE MORE A PUFF OF WIND CAUGHT HER SAIL AND HEELED HER OVER SO THAT HE COULD GET A GOOD LOOK OVER HER SIDE
YES,"--"NO,"--"NO CAME FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
HA LAUGHED THE BOY JEERINGLY
DON'T MATTER
YES--YES PANTED THE GIRL
FOLLOW THAT POOR LAD AND LET HIM KNOW THE TRUTH
BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THE MEN WERE ORDERED INTO TWO BOATS ONE COMMANDED BY GURR WITH WHOM WAS ARCHY THE OTHER BY THE BOATSWAIN ONLY LEAVING A VERY SMALL CREW ON BOARD WITH THE LIEUTENANT
CAN'T GET NO BISCUIT YET SIR
I'LL BE CAREFUL HE SAID TO HIMSELF
WHO CUT HIM DOWN WELL I'M FRAID IT WAS ME SAID ONE OF THE FAMILIAR VOICES
CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT
IT WAS SOME TEN YEARS LATER WHEN ONE OF HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE'S SMARTEST FRIGATES WAS HOMEWARD BOUND FROM THE EAST INDIES WHERE HER CAPTAIN HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY MANY A GALLANT ACT THAT AS SHE WAS MAKING FOR PORTSMOUTH WITH THE TALL WHITE CLIFFS OF THE ISLE JUST IN SIGHT A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG OFFICER WENT TO THE SIDE WHERE A SUN-BROWNED SEAMAN WAS STANDING GAZING SHOREWARD SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND
HE STOPPED SHORT TO LISTEN IT SOUNDED SO BIRD-LIKE AND SWEET AND HALF-LAUGHINGLY HE SANG THE LAST LINE OVER ALOUD THINKING THE WHILE HOW DISLOYAL HE WAS
AND IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE A CLEVER REVENGE FOR HE DETERMINED TO TURN THE TABLES ON HIS ENEMIES SHUT THEM IN AND HE HOPED TO MAKE THEM PRISONERS TILL HE COULD SIGNAL FOR HELP FROM THE CUTTER AND GET A BOAT'S CREW ASHORE
NOW MY LADS FORWARD JEMMY DADD'S COUNTENANCE CHANGED FROM ITS VACANT ASPECT TO ONE FULL OF CUNNING AS THE PARTY FROM THE CUTTER MOVED OFF BUT IT BECAME DULL AND SEMI-IDIOTIC AGAIN FOR GURR TURNED SHARPLY ROUND
I HAVE PICKED A FEW SAID THE TALL THIN GENTLEMAN COLOURING SLIGHTLY
ARCHY HESITATED
NICE CHICKENS MR RAYSTOKE HE SAID
THUS IT WAS THAT RAM WAS ALLOWED TO GLIDE RAPIDLY DOWN TILL BY EXPERIENCE THE MAN KNEW THAT HE WAS NEARLY AT THE BOTTOM WHEN THE ROPE BEGAN TO RUN MORE SLOWLY AND THEN WAS CHECKED EXACTLY AS THE BOY'S FEET TOUCHED THE STONE SHELF AND HE STEPPED FROM THE LOOP ON TO THE AMMONITE-STUDDED ROCK
MOTHER SAID I WAS TO BRING IT BACK TELL HER YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT NOW LOOK HERE CRIED RAM IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THAT BASKET BACK I WON'T BRING YOU WHAT I WAS GOING TO BRING TO-MORROW
ANYBODY WHO SAW A PERSON IN DANGER WOULD TRY AND SAVE HIS LIFE
YES IT'S ME SAID THE BOY EXCITEDLY
OH THERE WAS A CRY AND A QUICK RUSTLING TOWARD THE DOOR
FOG'S THICKER THAN IT WAS LAST NIGHT
LUCKY FOR HIM HE ISN'T ONE OF THE CREW
HE MOST SHIED EM AT ME AND I HAD TO CARRY EM BACK
IT AREN'T MUCH OF A THING FOR AN ORFICER AND A GENTLEMAN THOUGH I KNOW
AND AS SOON AS SHE REACHED THE TOP SHE SET OFF RUNNING AS HARD AS SHE COULD GO TO FIND HER FATHER TELL HIM ALL AND APPEAL TO HIM TO TRY AND SAVE THE POOR FELLOW FROM THE CRUEL TRIALS HE WAS CALLED UPON TO BEAR
BEGINNING TO FEEL SCARRED ABOUT HIM WHAT'S THAT SAID THE LIEUTENANT WHO HAD COME BACK FROM ABAFT UNHEARD
NEX RATS WE KETCH DOWN HOME I'LL BRING UP HERE FOR HIM TO KILL
THEN THE SOUND OF THE WAVES ON THE SHORE WAS COMPLETELY HUSHED AND HE FELT THAT THEY MUST EITHER BE DOWN IN A HOLLOW OR GOING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY INLAND
I SEE EM JUST NOW NO NO
STAND FAST IF THEY COME AT YOU
THE ONLY NOISES HE HEARD WERE THOSE HE MADE IN STEPPING ON ONE SIDE OF SOME PIECE OF STONE WHICH GAVE FORTH A MUSICAL CLINK AS IT STRUCK ANOTHER
HOW COULD HE
THAT'S WHERE THE WASPS NEST WAS DESTROYED THEN TO HIMSELF I WONDER WHETHER CELIA WILL BE GLAD TO SEE ME SHE WAS
AND THE MEN ROWED ON AND IN DUE TIME REACHED THE COVE WHERE ALL WAS PERFECTLY QUIET THE TIDE FALLING AND AS THEY LANDED QUITE A NOISY TRAMP HAD TO BE MADE OVER THE FINE PEBBLES IN WHICH THE MEN'S FEET SANK
RAM SAT THERE HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MIDSHIPMAN BUT IT WAS NOT TAKEN AND FOR A SPACE THEY GAZED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
WHAT'S--HERE
COME HERE AHOY CELIA WAS LEANING OVER THE RUGGED STEPS GAZING DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS BENEATH THE FERNS WHEN IN A FAINT SMOTHERED DISTANT WAY THERE CAME THIS HAIL MAKING HER NEARLY DROP HER BASKET AS SHE STARTED AWAY FROM THE PIT
NO I REMEMBER THE MEN COMING TO FETCH AWAY THE THINGS AND THEN I FOUND HIM WATCHING SHE STOOD GAZING BEFORE HER WITH HER PUZZLED FEELING INCREASING TILL A THOUGHT STRUCK HER
WONDER WHETHER MISS CELIA HEARD US HE SAID
THE ANSWER CAME LIKE A FLASH
SEE ANYTHING NO WHISPERED THE LIEUTENANT AFTER SWEEPING HIS GLASS ROUND
AND AS IF THE PASSAGE THEY HAD LEFT WERE SOME VAST CANNON THE ARTIFICIAL WALL LEFT WAS BLOWN RIGHT OUT BY AN AWFUL BURST OF FLAME THE STONES HURTLING DOWN AS IF THE END OF THE CLIFFS HAD COME AND FALLING WITH A MIGHTY SPLASH INTO THE CHASM
SUPPOSE THEY WERE TO ROW RIGHT ON TO THE CUTTER
THE SMUGGLERS HAD NOT DARED TO KILL HIM OR THROW HIM INTO THE SEA AS HE HAD HEARD OF THEM DOING ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION BUT AS FAR AS HE COULD MAKE OUT THEY HAD CAST HIM DOWN INTO SOME TERRIBLE PLACE TO DIE
FOR JEMMY BY LONG PRACTICE HAD MADE HIS EYES WORK LIKE A LOBSTER'S AND AS HE WENT ON THEY WERE ROLLING SLOWLY ROUND AND ROUND TAKING IN EVERYTHING KEEPING A LOOK-OUT TO SEA AND WATCHING THE REVENUE CUTTER SWEEPING THE OFFING RUNNING OVER THE FIELDS AND DOWNS AND HOLLOWS MISSING NOTHING IN SHORT AS HE STEADILY TRUDGED ALONG NOT EVEN THE FEW MUSHROOMS THAT THE PLEASANT SHOWERS HAD BROUGHT UP AND PLACING THEM IN HIS HAT
HERE CUT HIM LOOSE LADS
NOT MUCH GOOD SHOWING THEM IF THEY WERE IN THE FOG HE WENT ON GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE MIST WHICH LAY BELOW HIM AND AT LAST WAS DESCENDING THE ZIGZAG PATH WITH THE STARS BLOTTED OUT AND THE TINY DROPS OF MOISTURE GATHERING ON HIS EYELASHES FINDING HIS WAY MORE BY INSTINCT THAN SIGHT
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
PRAY PRAY PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL
BOB HARRIS TAKE THE FAR LEFT WELL MASTER RAYSTOKE SIR GRUMBLED DICK I CALL THAT GIVING A FELLOW A PRIZE
I'VE DEGRADED MYSELF ENOUGH HE SAID ANGRILY AND THERE ARE SURE TO BE BARS ACROSS
I DIDN'T TELL YOU HE SAID WHAT I SAW WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE FARM NO
AND HE STARED ABOUT WILDLY AGAIN IN SEARCH OF SOME MEANS OF GETTING TO HIS ADVERSARY
THE ONLY WAY WAS TO DRAW UP HIS LEGS GIVE HIMSELF AN IMPETUS BY KICKING AGAINST THE ROCK SWINGING TO AND FRO AND THEN LETTING HIMSELF AT A CERTAIN MOMENT WHEN HE WAS WELL BEYOND THE BOY DROP ON TO THE SHELF
SOON AFTER HE LEARNED THAT THIS HAD NOT BEEN THE PLACE WHERE THE STONES WERE CARRIED OUT FOR LANDING IN BOATS BUT THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH ALL THE REFUSE WAS DISCHARGED TO FALL IN A CRUMBLING HEAP A TREMENDOUS DISTANCE BELOW TO BE WASHED AWAY BY THE WAVES WHICH CURVED OVER AND OVER AGAINST THE FOOT AND ROLLED UP INTO THE CHASM
AREN'T SEEN NO LADS WITH NO RED CAPS UP HERE SAID THE MAN WITH A VACANT LOOK
THERE MAY BE A LITTLE OF THE WASPS COMB LEFT EH I'M AFRAID THE WHOLE OF THE STORES WOULD BE DESTROYED AH WELL WE SHALL SEE AND--WHO ARE THESE SIR RISDON AND LADY GRAEME AND THEIR DAUGHTER WHISPERED ARCHY WHO COLOURED AS HE SAW CELIA LOOKING AT HIM DEFIANTLY
WHY YOU CLUMSY YOUNG BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE THE MIDSHIPMAN TOUCHED HIS RED CAP
I NEVER USED TO THINK THEY WERE HALF SO BEAUTIFUL AS THEY ARE TILL I WAS SHUT UP IN THIS HORRIBLE HOLE
I KNEW IT AND OH I SAY MR BROUGH YOU DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A BEAST WHAT I FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT THE SMUGGLERS BUT THEY CAUGHT ME AND I'VE BEEN A PRISONER EVER SINCE
GOOD-BYE MISS
YOU CAN MANAGE HIM
I DIDN'T MEAN FOWLS I MEANT PEOPLE OH EGGS INDEED
THE BEGGAR WANTS TO BE CIVIL HE SAID
IT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL WHISPERED LADY GRAEME WILDLY
AND SHE BEGAN IDLY TO PICK UP SCRAPS OF WILD THYME AND TOSS AT THE DOG WHO VAINLY KEPT ON MAKING RUSHES TOWARD THE SLOPE OF THE GREAT CLIFF
I DID NOT COME TO FRIGHTEN YOU WHO ARE YOU I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
THERE OUGHT TO BE A TRAP-DOOR COVERED WITH STONES LEADING DOWN A PLACE LIKE A WELL YES
WHY IF YOU'D SIN THE SUN RISE THERE IT WOULD MAK YOU STAND ON YOUR HEAD RATHER SEE THIS ON MY FEET DICK CRIED THE LAD
FULL O HOYSTERS
I WONDER WHERE THAT MIDSHIPMAN IS SHE THOUGHT FORGETTING THE DOG FOR THE MOMENT
THE FARMER AND HIS SON HAD COME UP HERE AND WERE WAITING FOR THE MEN TO ACT AS CARRIERS
BUT THE SMUGGLERS AND THEIR SHORE FRIENDS HAD BEEN MORE CAREFUL THIS TIME AND SEARCH WHERE THEY WOULD THE CUTTER'S MEN COULD FIND NO TRACES OF ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND THE LIEUTENANT HAD HIMSELF ROWED BACK TO THE CUTTER KEEPING THE BOAT ALONGSIDE READY TO SEND ALONG SHORE TO THE COVE TO SEEK FOR TIDINGS OF GURR AND DICK BUT ALTERING HIS MIND HE HAD THE LITTLE VESSEL UNMOORED ONCE MORE TO RUN BACK THE SIX MILES ALONG THE COAST TILL THE CUTTER WAS ABREAST OF THE COVE,--THE FIRST PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED POSSIBLE FOR A BOAT TO LAND,--AND HERE HE SENT A CREW ASHORE TO BRING HIS TWO MEN OFF
BUT YOU'D BETTER PROMISE SHOW ME THE WAY OUT WON'T YOU HAVE SOME MILK FIRST DO YOU HEAR ME AND BREAD AND BUTTER HOME-MADE WILL YOU SHOW ME THE WAY OUT NOR NO HAM
STOP--NOT A WORD YET
YOU TWO ARE I SUPPOSE QUITE IGNORANT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF KEEPING ME HERE WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT JEMMY SAID RAM
THERE SHOULD BE A LANE OR TRACK LEADING DOWN TO THE CLIFF HE KNEW BUT WHERE IT WAS HE COULD NOT SAY
YOU SEND ONE OF YOUR CHAPS TO-MORROW TO MOTHER AND TELL HER I'M ABOARD AND GOING TO BE A SAILOR AND SHE'S TO GIVE HIM YOUR LITTLE SWORD AS FATHER PUT IN THE TOP DRAWER ARCHY'S EYES SPARKLED FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DIRK WAS A BITTER MEMORY
WELL WE SHALL SEE YES
COME ON BOARD AND THE LIEUTENANT WILL LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY AND TAKE YOU AND WE'LL MAKE YOU A REGULAR MAN-O'-WAR'S-MAN AND SET ME TO FIGHT AGEN MY FATHER AND ALL MY OLD MATES NO
HOW UNFORTUNATE HE SAID
THE OTHER HIGH UP FACING TOWARD THE SEA MUST BE UP AT THE HOZE
HE LISTENED AGAIN
WELL I AM GLAD CRIED THE MASTER
OH DEAR ME DEAR ME DEAR ME SAID THE PLUMP COMFORTABLE-LOOKING WOMAN AS THE DOOR CLOSED ON HER HUSBAND'S BACK
NO NO--DON'T SHOUT AT EM
WONDER WHETHER THEY SAW THE LIGHTS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
HOPE HE WON'T
WHO LOCKED YOU IN WILL YOU COME ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR SAID ARCHY IN AN ANGRY WHISPER
THEY GAZED ROUND EXCITEDLY AS THE LIGHT BROADENED BUT THERE WAS NO CUTTER WHERE THEY EXPECTED SHE WOULD BE BUT TEN MINUTES LATER DIMLY SEEN AS YET THEY MADE HER OUT MILES AWAY UNDER FULL SAIL IN CHASE OF A LONG LOW THREE-MASTED LUGGER AT WHICH SHE WAS KEEPING UP A SLOW AND STEADY FIRE
NEARLY
THEN WHERE DIDN'T YOU SEARCH ARCHY TOLD HIM AND HIS REASONS
IT'S SAFE ENOUGH NOW YOU'RE A FOOL CAME BACK IN A SAVAGE GROWL
DON'T TRY ANY MORE SIR
IF YOU WAIT TILL THE TIDE'S RIGHT OUT YOU CAN GET IN THROUGH GRABLEY'S HOLE ARCHY REPORTED THIS AND IN DUE TIME GURR WAS LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE CUTTER THE LIEUTENANT WENT OFF IN ONE BOAT AND THE OTHER WAS IN ARCHY'S CHARGE
BUT THE DOG'S ACTION BROUGHT HER TO HERSELF AS HE BEGAN AGAIN TO BARK FURIOUSLY AND TORE AT THE STONES
COME DOWN THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FOR GOOD-HEARTEDLY ENOUGH RAM HAD AS BEFORE-SAID REPENTED AND COME BACK ALONE
THEIR EGGS IS KEGS O BRANDY
THIS IS A PRETTY STATE OF AFFAIRS CRIED THE MASTER
AGAIN HE FELT ALL ABOUT THE ROOM TO SATISFY HIMSELF AFRESH THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OUT AND HE PAUSED BY THE CHIMNEY HALF DISPOSED TO ESSAY THAT MEANS OF ESCAPE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
HOW DARE YOU BUT GRIP DID DARE AND HE WOULD HAVE DASHED AT THE LABOURER IF CELIA HAD NOT CAUGHT HIM BY THE LOOSE SKIN OF HIS NECK WHEN HE BEGAN TO SHAKE HIS HEAD AND WHINE IN A WAY THAT SOUNDED LIKE PROTESTING
HE GOT UP AGAIN AND FELT HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY TO THE RIGHT FOR THE STONES ROSE LIKE A BANK OR BARRIER IN HIS WAY AND HE WENT MANY YARDS WITHOUT FINDING A WAY THROUGH
NOT A BIT SAID THE FISHER-FARMER WITH A CHUCKLE
HOLD UP LAD
LOOK HERE FOR INSTANCE HERE'S A CHANCE FOR US HIST
IF YOU HAD AS MUCH TO FRET YOU AS I DO WIFE YOU'D BE CROSS WHY YOU TOLD ME THIS MORNING THAT YOU CARRIED YOUR CROP OF SEA HAY WITHOUT A DROP OF WATER ON IT FARMER SHACKLE SHUT ONE EYE TIGHTENED UP HIS MOUTH AND LOOKED WITH HIS OTHER EYE AT HIS WIFE WHICH WAS HIS IDEA OF LAUGHING
AND IF THEY HAVE CAUGHT HIM WE'LL MAKE HIM SHOW US THE WAY
THANK YOU SAID A GRUFF VOICE
I DON'T KNOW THOUGH HE SAID AS HE PUT A BLEEDING KNUCKLE TO HIS LIPS
WHO MORE LIKELY TO BE MAKING FOR THE LEDGE WHICH AS FAR AS HE COULD JUDGE WAS A POINT OR TWO OFF TO THE RIGHT
I'LL LEAD AND HANG IT
HE WENT CAUTIOUSLY ON WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS THROUGH THE INTENSE DARKNESS AND HIS FEET TRACED THE FLAT CURLS OF STONE AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT HE DID NOT FIND ANY WALL AND NOW AS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO BACK TO WHERE HE HAD BEEN WHEN HE FIRST AWOKE HE FOUND THAT HE HAD NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA AS TO WHICH DIRECTION HE OUGHT TO TAKE
BUT HOUR AFTER HOUR WENT ON THE CARRIERS AUGMENTED BY A DOZEN MORE CAME AND WENT IN TWO BANDS NOW SO THAT PART WERE RETURNING AS THE OTHERS WERE GOING
KEEP BACK MY LADS SAID THE LIEUTENANT
AND STILL SMILING AT THE DOG'S ANTICS THE GIRL WANDERED ON NEARER AND NEARER TO WHERE THE LAND SUDDENLY ENDED AND THE CLIFF WENT SHARPLY DOWN TO THE SEA
ACAUSE IT'S SEA-HAAR AND YOU CAN'T MAKE NOWT ELSE ON IT SIR THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING OF THEM IN THE NIGHT I SUPPOSE NO SIR
THEY'RE ALL IN THE GAME
I'M FREE AND I CAN LAUGH AT THEM NOW
I TELL YOU THEY'VE GOT TALLY ON THE DECK OF THE CUTTER AND I TELL YOU YOU YOUNG RAM SHACKLE I'M TOO SLEEPY TO SEE FUN ANYWHERE
YOU DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE DANGER WHEN YOU SAW ME TRYING TO ESCAPE NO I DIDN'T DID I SAID RAM THOUGHTFULLY
AND SHE HAS MADE MY FACE ALL WET WITH HER CRYING THEY WERE ON THE MARCH NOW TO THE HOZE WITH THE LIEUTENANT IN THE HIGHEST OF GLEE AND CHATTING MERRILY TO ARCHY AS A BROTHER OFFICER AND A FRIEND
AFTER THE DARKNESS OF THE OLD QUARRY WITH ITS FAINT ODOUR OF SPIRITS THE NIGHT SEEMED COMPARATIVELY LIKE NOONDAY AND THE PURE BRISK AIR THAT FANNED HIS CHEEK DELICIOUS
PUT THE STUFF OUT ON THE SAIL
I'VE KILLED HIM
ROUSE UP
OH HE SAID TO HIMSELF
PRAY FORGIVE ME
WHAT ARE THEY UP TO SAID JEMMY SHADING HIS EYES
TO LOOK FOR YOU PR'APS SAID THE BOY GRINNING OR ELSE THEY THINK YOU'RE DROWNDED LOOK HERE SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN SUDDENLY YOU BEHAVED VERY TREACHEROUSLY TO ME BUT I'LL FORGIVE YOU IF YOU'LL LET ME GO LOOK HERE REPLIED THE BOY YOU BEHAVED VERY TREACHEROUSLY TO US DRESSING UP AND SPYING ON US
I BELIEVE I COULD DO IT MYSELF
HE MUST HAVE COME UP QUITE FIFTY FEET AFTER ASCENDING THE SLOPE ALONG WHICH HE HAD WALKED AND HERE HE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE FLIGHT OF CLUMSY STAIRS ON A KIND OF PLATFORM OF RUGGED STONES AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM THERE WAS A CHINK SO NARROW THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE THRUST A HAND THROUGH IT BUT WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF A GLEAM OF LIGHT
THE OPENING INTO THE COVE WAS REACHED AND THE BOAT RUN ASHORE AND ONE MAN BEING LEFT AS KEEPER THE LITTLE WELL-ARMED PARTY OF A DOZEN MEN WERE MARCHED OFF ALONG THE NARROW ROAD TOWARD THE HOZE
WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING YOU FOR MY FIRST OFFICER
AS ARCHY STOOD THERE IN THE DARKNESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR WHICH HE KNEW MUST LEAD UP INTO THE HOUSE HE LOOKED BACK TO SEE A MAN COME OUT OF THE CELLAR HIS FIGURE JUST DIMLY SEEN BY THE LIGHT FROM WITHIN AND BELOW AND OVER THE MAN'S SHOULDERS WERE SWUNG A COUPLE OF KEGS
AND I CAN SAY NOW HONESTLY I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY HAVE STILL GOODS LYING THERE OR HAVE TAKEN THEM AWAY BUT CELIA--KEEP IT FROM HER OF COURSE AND ABOUT THE MISSING BOY
BANGED THE DOOR DOWN AND THEY'VE BEEN RATTLING BIG STONES ON IT
THE MIDSHIPMAN TOOK THE ORDER ON DECK AND RAM STARED
GOING BACK YES SAID GURR SMARTLY
THEY'RE ALL LIKE ANY ONE ELSE HUMPH
NOTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM AS FAR AS HE COULD MAKE OUT IN THE DARKNESS AND IF THOSE WRETCHED BARS HAD ONLY BEEN AWAY HOW SOON HE COULD HAVE ESCAPED
MR GURR I CAN ALMOST TOUCH HIM
AND HE LAUGHED FOR HE COULD SEE NO DIFFICULTIES NOW
WHICH IS THE WAY OUT UP ABOVE HERE MR GURR CLOSE TO WHERE WE STAND VERY WELL SIR
WHAT DID IT MEAN
MORNIN SAID JEMMY
DUTCH P'RAPS
BUT AS WE DIDN'T NEITHER OF US GO OVER IT'S NO USE TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND IT LOOKS BAD TRAVELLING BUT IN WE'VE GOT TO GO IF THEY WON'T SURRENDER
YES SIR YOU SIR
I WON'T DO IT I CAN'T THOUGHT ARCHY
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT THE SMUGGLER'S A SORT OF GHOST AND HIS LUGGER'S ALL FANCY WELL NOT EXACTLY SIR BECAUSE IF THEY WAS THEY COULDN'T CARRY REAL CARGOES WHICH WOULDN'T BE LIKE THE SMUGGLER AND HIS LUGGER SIR AND OF COURSE THEN THE KEGS AND LACE WOULDN'T BE NO GOOD
SURELY A STAR OR THE MOON MUST BE UP HE THOUGHT AS HE KNELT DOWN AND RESUMED HIS TASK FEELING SOMEHOW A GOOD DEAL RESTED
GET FARTHER ALONG HE SAID COOLLY
IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT EXTREMELY LONELY AND TO RIGHT AND LEFT THERE WERE THE GREAT MASSES OF CLIFF WHICH SEEMED LIKE HUGE HILLS SUDDENLY CHOPPED OFF BY THE SEA AND BEFORE HER THE WIDE-STRETCHING AMETHYSTINE PLAIN WITH A SAIL OR TWO FAR AWAY
MY LAD AND ONE OF THE MEN HAVE GONE AFTER A STRAY COW
LOOK AT THAT
THEN HE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD PASSED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL TO ESCAPE--TO SET HIM AT LIBERTY--TO BE HIS COMPANION
THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN BY RAM
I DO LIKE YOU SOMETHING LIKE A HYSTERICAL SOB BURST FROM THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN'S BREAST AT THIS
THESE ARE NOT THE SORT O FOLK TO DO THAT KIND O THING
WHERE RAM CAME DOWN WAS THE LAND ENTRANCE AND THE RAY OF LIGHT MARKED THE OPENING IN THE FACE OF THE CLIFF FROM WHICH THE PIECES OF STONE HAD BEEN LOWERED DOWN INTO BOATS OR SHIPS BELOW
GOOD SIX MILE AWAY FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW SAID GURR
I'LL FIGHT YOU WITH A STICK YOU INSOLENT YOUNG SCOUNDREL CRIED ARCHY DARTING HIS HAND THROUGH BETWEEN THE BARS OVERCOME NOW BY HIS RAGE AND CATCHING RAM BY THE COLLAR
THERE'S NO ONE HERE BUT OURSELVES
STILL HE WORKED ON ENLARGING THE HOLE AND SENDING THE BROKEN PIECES AND MORTAR RATTLING DOWN THE FACE OF THE CLIFF INTO THE SEA TILL THERE WAS NOTHING TO HINDER HIS CRAWLING OUT AT ANY TIME AND EITHER GETTING TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF OR DOWN BELOW TO THE SHORE
EVEN AS HE GAZED DOWN HE MOMENTARILY EXPECTED TO SEE RAM GLIDE SLOWLY OFF AND WITH BROW COVERED WITH GREAT DROPS OF PERSPIRATION AND HIS HANDS WET AND COLD THE MIDSHIPMAN ROSE PANTING TO HIS FEET LOOKED ROUND AND SENT UP SHOUT AFTER SHOUT FOR HELP
PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE THOUGHT AS BY AN INSPIRATION THE LIEUTENANT HAD ALTERED HIS PLANS AND WAS SENDING MEN TO LOOK AFTER AND PROTECT HIM
WONDERED WHOSE IT WAS
PITY WE DIDN'T GO ON AFTER THEM
HE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ALARMED FOR THERE WAS NOT A RAY VISIBLE AND EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN THE LIGHT CAST BY THE OPENED LANTHORN WOULD HAVE HIDDEN IT
THIS YOUNG LADY LIVES AT THE HOUSE MR GURR SAID ARCHY ALOUD AND SHE WILL SHOW US THE WAY POOR CELIA FELT AS IF SHE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR SPEAK
GIVE HIM YOUR PAW GRIP SHE TOOK THE DOG BY THE EAR AND LED HIM UNWILLINGLY TOWARD THE BOY WHOSE EYES SPARKLED WITH DELIGHT WHILE THE HOUND WHIMPERED AND WHINED AND PROTESTED AS IF HE HAD AN UNCONQUERABLE DISLIKE TO THE ACT HE WAS CALLED UPON TO PERFORM
WE'VE BEEN ASHORE A DOZEN TIMES MY LAD AND SEARCHED EVERYWHERE TILL THE SKIPPER THOUGHT YOU MUST HAVE RUN AWAY RUN AWAY CRIED ARCHY HUSKILY
BUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OF THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM AND HE TOO STOPPED DEAD SHORT
SO STRONG A CURRENT OF AIR SET THROUGH THE OLD QUARRY THAT BY THE TIME THEY HAD ENDED THE AIR WAS GOOD
YOU WOULDN'T KICK IT OVER WOULD YOU TALLY OLD COW THE COW WAVED HER TAIL AND WHISKED IT ABOUT THE MAN'S NECK AS THE MILKING WENT ON TO THE DELIGHT OF THE MEN WHO BEGAN TO SEE BISCUIT AND MILK IN PROSPECT WHILE THE TWO OFFICERS WHO WERE NONE THE LESS EAGER FOR A DRAUGHT AS A CHANGE FROM THEIR MISERABLE ORDINARY FARE VEILED THEIR EXPECTATIONS UNDER A SEVERE ASPECT OF IMPORTANCE
PUT EM WELL BACK BOY
HERE FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS HE WORKED HARD HELPING TO STACK THE LITTLE BRANDY KEGS AT FIRST AND AFTERWARDS THE SMALL TIGHTLY PACKED BALES AND CHESTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT MORE QUICKLY NOW--A DOZEN OF SWARTHY DIRTY-LOOKING MEN WITH EARRINGS AND SHORT LOOSE CANVASS TROUSERS WHICH LOOKED LIKE PETTICOATS HELPING TO BRING UP THE CARGO AND SHOWED BY THEIR PRESENCE THAT ALL HAD BEEN LANDED FROM THE LUGGER THAT WHICH WAS NOW BEING BROUGHT UP CONSISTING OF THE ACCUMULATION ON THE LEDGES AND AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
WELL IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LAND HERE CONTINUED THE LIEUTENANT
NOW SIR SAID THE LIEUTENANT I WANT YOU TO ANSWER ME A FEW QUESTIONS
I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO SEND YOU ON SHORE MR GURR
HE MUST BE AWAKE
TALK ABOUT THISTLES AND STINGING NETTLES HE MUTTERED WHY THERE'S NO BEARING HIM TO-DAY AND ALL ON ACCOUNT OF A SCAMP OF A MIDDY SUCH AS THERE'S A HUNDRED TIMES TOO MANY ON IN THE R'YAL NAVY
HE FELT AS IF HE WOULD GIVE ANYTHING FOR SOME FOOD AND THE VERY MENTION OF THE TASTY VIANDS MADE HIS MOUTH WATER BUT HE ONLY STAMPED HIS FOOT AND TRIED TO SHAKE HIMSELF FREE
THEY'LL GO AND GET ALL THE CARGO FROM THE HIDING-PLACE AND TAKE IT SOMEWHERE AND I SHALL KNOW NOTHING HE BIT HIS LIP WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND GAVE AN ANGRY STAMP ON THE GRASS
MOST LIKE YOU'RE NEVER FOUND YES TIS VERY SLIPPY MISS CELIA SAID RAM BEGINNING TO HACK AGAIN AT HIS STICK
DON'T YOU SEE YOU CAN'T GET AWAY I WILL GET AWAY SAID ARCHY STERNLY
GOOD MORNING SAID ARCHY SHORTLY
FOLD IT WIDE
BACK ON BOARD THE CUTTER THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF BUSTLE AND EXCITEMENT AMONG THE MEN FOR AFTER MONTHS OF UNFRUITFUL HANGING ABOUT THE COAST CHASING LUGGERS WHICH PROVED TO BE EMPTY FOLLOWING FALSE LEADS TO GET THEM OFF THE SCENT OR OUT OF THE WAY WHEN CONTRABAND GOODS WERE TO BE LANDED HERE WAS GENUINE INFORMATION AT LAST THE SMUGGLERS HAVING AFTER SUCH LONG IMMUNITY PLACED THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF THE KING'S MEN
IT'S AS DARK FOR THEM AS IT IS FOR US SO THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE US AT A DISADVANTAGE
FRIGHTENED SAID RAM WHO WAS WATCHING HIM
IT IS AGAINST THE LAW DUTCHMAN'S LAW NOT THE LAWS OF BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE
I'LL LEAD MY MEN BACK TO THE BOAT AT ONCE HE RAISED HIS HAT TO LADY GRAEME AN EXAMPLE FOLLOWED BY THE MASTER CLUMSILY AS HE BACKED AWAY TO THE MEN WHOM HE FACED ROUND THE ORDER WAS GIVEN AND THEY BEGAN TO MARCH BACK
IT WAS HARD WORK TO KEEP FROM STARTING AT ONCE BUT THE MIDSHIPMAN FELT THAT IF HE DID HIS ESCAPE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AT ANY MOMENT AND IF IT WERE IT WAS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME BEFORE HE WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE SMUGGLING GANG AFTER HIM AND HE WOULD BE HUNTED DOWN TO A LOT TEN TIMES MORE BITTER FROM THE FACT OF HIS HAVING FAILURE TO CONTEMPLATE AND FORM HIS MENTAL FOOD
THEN TO CURVE BACK AND FROM THIS POINT STRIKE OUT TO THE LEFT IN SEARCH OF HIS RESTING-PLACE AND THE BASKET
LET HIM GO AND COME ON CRIED RAM
IF I'D SLIPPED AND THE ROPE HADN'T SNAPPED THAT BIG STONE WOULD HAVE COME DOWN ATOP OF ME AND WHAT A MESS YOU'D HAVE BEEN IN IF FATHER HAD SAID YOU PITCHED ME OFF LET'S GET BACK SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN WHO FELT SICK AT HEART
O COURSE SIR THEY CAN GO UP THE CLIFFS AND OVER EM LIKE FLIES IN SUGAR BASINS
GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR BOY
A THICK CARPET IN THE CENTRE
IT WAS NOT REPEATED AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT IT WAS FANCY WHEN THE SOUND CAME AGAIN NEARER THEN NEARER STILL TILL THERE WAS A PROLONGED VOLLEY OF CANINE-WORDS LET US CALL THEM FOR THEY EVIDENTLY MEANT SOMETHING FROM THEIR BEING SO PERSISTENT
NO NOT A SIGN OF ANYTHING BUT KNOWING THAT SEEING WAS LIMITED ENOUGH HE PUT HIS HAND TO HIS EAR AND STOOD LEANING OVER THE SIDE LISTENING FOR A FULL TEN MINUTES BEFORE WITH AN IMPATIENT EJACULATION HE TURNED TO SPEAK TO THE INFORMER WHO WAS NOT AFT BUT PROBABLY FORWARD AMONG THE MEN
IT ARN'T NO GOOD SIR
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE
NO SIR HAVEN'T HEARD ANY ONE TALKING ABOUT HIM EH
A CLOSET--A ROOM--A STAIRCASE--AN OPEN WINDOW LEADING IN ANOTHER DIRECTION TO THAT WHERE THE MEN WERE BUSY
WHICH WAY SHALL WE GO I DON'T KNOW MR GURR CAN'T MAKE OUT WHICH IS THE NORTH CAN YOU NO SIR NOR THE SOUTH NEITHER HUMPH
HE MUST HAVE BEEN FOR HOURS THINKING OFTEN IN A DROWSY HALF-CONFUSED WAY BUT ROUSING UP FROM TIME TO TIME TO FEEL HIS RESENTMENT GROWING AGAINST RAM WHO SEEMED TO HIM NOW TO BE THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE WHOLE SMUGGLING GANG
WON'T DO MY LAD--WON'T DO RAM JUMPED UP STEPPED OVER THE THWART SEIZED THE MAN'S HEAD AND SCREWED IT ROUND TOWARD THE CUTTER WHERE THE SCENE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED WAS PLAIN IN THE SUNSHINE
STARED IN HIS FACE
AND--ER--I WOULD NOT USE MY PISTOL RAYSTOKE NOT SHOOT SIR WELL--NO
D'YER HEAR
MADE OUR PLANS BADLY HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
NO ONE NEED BE LOST FOR LONG IF HE HAS A VOICE
CHAPTER NINETEEN
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT BOAT OR SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO RUN AWAY FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE LITTLE YAWL THEY WERE MAKING FOR WAS SUDDENLY CHANGED AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SEEING HOW THE SECOND BOAT COMMANDED BY THE BOATSWAIN WAS GOING TO HEAD HER OFF FROM THE WEST SHE WAS BEING PUT ON THE OTHER COURSE SO AS TO RUN EAST
COME LOOK UP
WHY RAM SAID THE OFFICER
SO NARROWED WAS IT NOW THAT A COUPLE OF STEPS IN EITHER DIRECTION ENABLED HIM TO TOUCH A WALL WHILE ABOUT TWENTY SHORT PACES FARTHER ON THE ASCENT GREW MUCH MORE STRAIGHT AND THERE WAS NO FEAR OF A PIT OR SHAFT IN THE WAY FOR HE FOUND THAT ROUGHLY SQUARE BLOCKS OF STONE WERE LAID LIKE A FLIGHT OF STEPS UP WHICH HE CLAMBERED AND THEN SUNK DOWN OVERCOME BY THE FEELING OF JOY WHICH HAD FLOODED HIS BRAIN
SEIZING THE COIL OF ROPE HE SHOOK IT OPEN AND SELECTING ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLOCKS OF STONE WHICH HAD AT SOME TIME FALLEN FROM ABOVE HE MADE ONE END OF THE ROPE FAST TRIED IT TO MAKE SURE LOWERED THE OTHER OVER THE EDGE AND CAREFULLY SLID DOWN SWINGING TO AND FRO AND TURNING SLOWLY ROUND TO HANG FOR A FEW MOMENTS TRYING TO PLANT HIS FOOT ON THE LEDGE WITHOUT TOUCHING RAM FOR HE FELT MORE THAN EVER CONVINCED HE WOULD GLIDE OFF AT THE SLIGHTEST SHOCK
DON'T YOU BE SCARED ABOUT THAT
GOING ABOUT WITH LANTHORNS AND WHITE CANVAS IS SHOWING EVERYBODY WHERE YOU ARE AFTER A TIME AS THEY GLIDED ON CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF A TWINKLING LIGHT OR TWO ON THE SHORE THE MAN GREW A LITTLE MORE COMMUNICATIVE AND BEGAN TO WHISPER BITS OF INFORMATION AND ADVICE TO THE LIEUTENANT
LET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE WHAT FOR CRIED RAM
SELL
TELL EM TO TAKE NO NOTICE SIR RISDON
THEN GIVING THE MASTER HIS IDEAS THE MEN WERE ALLOWED A FEW MINUTES BREATHING SPACE BEFORE BEING FORMED IN A LINE WITH A SPACE OF A FEW YARDS BETWEEN THE MEN ONE END OF THE LINE BEING CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THE OTHER SOME DISTANCE INLAND
COULD IT REALLY HAVE BEEN A DREAM YES IT MUST HAVE BEEN OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE GONE AND TOLD HIS CAPTAIN AND THEY WOULD HAVE COME AND SEARCHED THE CELLAR AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAD TROUBLE SHE TURNED HER EYES FROM THE SEA AND BEGAN TO SEARCH THE GREEN SLOPES AROUND AND THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AS SHE COULD SIGHT ON THE HIGHEST SLOPE RIGHT AT THE END OF THE VALLEY A WHITE SPECK WHICH SUDDENLY APPEARED OUT OF THE EARTH AND THEN STOOD OUT CLEAR ON THE GREEN TURF AND SEEMED TO BE LOOKING ABOUT BEFORE TURNING AND PLUNGING DOWN AGAIN
IT WAS DISCOURAGING TO HAVE SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE BUT ARCHY RAYSTOKE HAD BEEN FOR DAYS CONDEMNED TO INACTIVITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING AT SOMETHING DEFINITE WHICH PROFFERED A WAY OF ESCAPE MADE HIM TOIL ON WITH ALL HIS HIS MIGHT
AND YOU'D BETTER GO AND SEE IF THEY'VE GONE AH YES LAD I'LL GO AND SEE IF THEY'VE GONE
YES FATHER SAID RAM
THINK SO GURR SAID ARCHY JOYFULLY
SHE KNEW WHO MR RAYSTOKE WAS AND IT SEEMED HORRIBLE TO HER THAT THE FRANK GOOD-LOOKING YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN SHOULD BE KEPT A PRISONER IN SUCH A TOMB-LIKE PLACE AS THAT
AND TAKE OFF THEM BOOTS AND HANG EM ROUND YOUR NECK
WHY--HURRAH
OH IT'S INSUFFERABLE ARCHY'S WORDS WERE VERY BITTER BUT SOMEHOW ALL THE TIME HE KEPT THINKING ABOUT THEIR ADVENTURE AND THE LAD'S BRAVERY AND THEN ABOUT HIS HAVING SAVED HIM
I KNOW THE GREAT VAULT IS FULL OF SMUGGLED THINGS SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND THAT THEY WILL THINK MY FATHER PUT THEM THERE
DIDN'T HEAR THE SAILORS SAY NOTHING ON THE CUTTER DID YOU NOT A WORD THE MIDDY'S HEART SEEMED TO GIVE A THROB
YES YOU DID SIR
IS IT FIFTY POUND OR AREN'T IT FIFTY POUND IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY MY MAN
BUT IT WOULD BE UNDIGNIFIED IN AN OFFICER HE FELT
THE MIST WREATHS GREW THINNER AND MORE TRANSPARENT AND THE PEARLY GLISTENING FOAM WHICH FOLLOWED THE BREAKING OF EACH WAVE AT THE FOOT OF THE MIGHTY CLIFFS ADDED FRESH BEAUTY TO THE GLORIOUS SCENE
THE COURSE SHE CHOSE WAS DOWN IN THE HOLLOWS BETWEEN THE HILLS TILL AT LAST SHE STRUCK THE ONE ALONG WHICH SHE HAD PASSED AFTER LEAVING RAM AND HIS COMPANION AND TURNED DOWN HERE BELIEVING THAT IF THE BOY SELECTED IT THERE WOULD BE GOOD REASON FOR HIS SO DOING
A MINUTE LATER AS ARCHY LAY THERE PERFECTLY HELPLESS THE NOISES INCREASED AGAIN
REAL COWS LIVES IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND FEEDS ON GRASS
HE KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER THE PARTS HE HAD SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE DARKNESS BUT BEYOND THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT PILLARS HE HAD MARKED THE PLACE HAD MADE NO IMPRESSION
GENTLEMEN DON'T FIGHT WITH LOW COMMON FELLOWS LIKE YOU BUT IF YOU DO NOT COME ROUND AND LET ME OUT NEXT TIME WE MEET I'LL HAVE A BIT OF ROPE'S-END READY FOR YOU RAM SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE BURST OUT WITH A LONG LOW FIT OF LAUGHTER
THERE WAS THE SEA AT A TERRIBLE DEPTH BELOW HIM AND ALL THAT DISTANCE TO CLIMB UP WITH HIS HANDS BLEEDING AND GIVING HIM INTENSE PAIN WHILE HIS ARMS FELT HALF JERKED OUT OF THEIR SOCKETS
A GREAT PITY
CAPT'N HERE HAS LOST ONE OF HIS MEN IF YOU'LL LET ME SPEAK I'LL EXPLAIN SAID ARCHY SHARPLY
OH HOW WEAK AND HUNGRY I AM
AND AT LAST SHE HAD CLIMBED SO HIGH THAT SHE COULD SEE THE BLUE WAVES SPREADING UP AND UP TO THE HORIZON AND ABOUT A COUPLE OF MILES OUT THE WHITE-SAILED CUTTER WHICH WAS CREEPING SLOWLY ALONG THE SHORE
WONDER WHETHER THOSE TWO HAVE LANDED THE COW BY THIS TIME WHISPERED GURR BREAKING IN UPON ONE OF ARCHY'S REVERIES IN WHICH HE SAW HIMSELF FOLLOWING A BAND OF SMUGGLERS LADEN WITH CONTRABAND GOODS
STUPID NAME FOR A PLACE YOU THINK THEN I HAVEN'T DONE MY DUTY SIR YES MR RAYSTOKE AS AN OFFICER I DO
AND I MIGHT GET SOME MUSHROOMS TOO SHE THOUGHT INSTEAD OF COMING OUT FOR NOTHING JUST THEN SHE HEARD GRIP AGAIN BARKING VERY FAINTLY
BUT THEY WON'T DARE TO GO TO THE HOZE SO I'LL LEAVE THE STUFF THERE AND CHANCE IT HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS HE LAY BEHIND THE STONES WATCHING TILL HE HAD SEEN RAM JEMMY AND THE COW ON BOARD THE CUTTER AND THE BOATS MADE FAST
ANOTHER BLOW ON THE BULKHEAD AND RUSTLING NOISE AND AS WELL AS IF HE HAD SEEN IT ALL ARCHY KNEW THAT HIS OFFICER HAD SNUGGLED DOWN UNDER THE CLOTHES AND GONE TO SLEEP
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU SAID CELIA TO HERSELF
I--BEG YOUR PARDON MASTER SHACKLE FOR DOING SO
SEEMS JUST THE TIME FOR HER TO COME WHEN THE SKIPPER'S SO SHORT-HANDED THAT HE CAN'T ATTACK YES WE ARE AN UNLUCKY CRAFT AND NO MISTAKE AND I MOST WISH SOMETIMES I'D NEVER SAILED IN HER
ARCHY PEERED IN AT THE DARK PASSAGE HIS HEART BEATING AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE MADE BY THE TWO MEN CRAWLING IN AND THE LAST OF THE TWO HAD HARDLY DISAPPEARED WHEN THERE WAS A SHOUT A SCUFFLE AND THE BOATSWAIN PLUNGED IN
SHE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OFFICER IN UNIFORM BEFORE AND I FRIGHTENED HER WITH MY DRAWN SWORD AT THAT MOMENT GURR CAME UP WITH THE MEN AND CELIA SEEMED AS IF TURNED TO STONE
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS ROAR OF LAUGHTER FROM EVERY ONE ON BOARD EXCEPT FROM DIRTY DICK WHO WAS DOWN ON HIS BACK A COUPLE OF YARDS AWAY STARING AT THE COW AS IF WONDERING HOW SHE COULD HAVE GONE OFF AS SHE DID
FUN IT TAKE IT HOME
THE SMUGGLERS HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION OF THE PLACE AND ON RAM REACHING THE SPOT HE WAS IN NOWISE SURPRISED TO FIND A GROUP OF ABOUT THIRTY MEN ON THE CLIFF CLUSTERED ABOUT THE END OF A SPAR WHOSE BUTT WAS RUN DOWN INTO A HOLE IN THE ROCK WHICH LAY A FOOT BENEATH THE TURF AND AT WHOSE END AS IT ROSE AT AN ANGLE WAS A PULLEY BLOCK AND ROPE RUN THROUGH READY FOR USE SHOULD THE LUGGER COME
THERE WAS A GOOD BROAD GREEN MARGE TO THE LANE ABOUT HERE AND HE STEPPED ON TO IT THE TURF DEADENING HIS FOOTSTEPS
PRAY HELP ME I WANT TO SHE SAID
HE STOPPED TO LISTEN HOPING TO HEAR THE BREAKING OF THE WAVES AMONG THE ROCKS WHICH WOULD HAVE PROVED WHAT HE WISHED TO KNOW AT ONCE
WE SHALL HAVE TO HANG HIM THEN JEMMY AFTER ALL AY LAD SAID THE MAN
I USED TO TRIP OVER THEM BUT I COULD GO ANYWHERE NOW IN THE DARK
YOU WERE IN COMMAND OF THE EXPEDITION AND THE BOSUN WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SECOND BOAT'S CREW
IT WAS A SHEEP AND IF IT WAS NOT IT WAS A DOG I TELL YOU SIR IT WAS THE SMUGGLER'S BOY RAM,--THE ONE WHO CAME ABOARD AFTER THE COW HANG THE COW SIR
THEN AS HE HEARD THE FARMER'S GRUFF VOICE HE DROPPED DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRAWL AMONG THE BUSHES
I SEE HIM A MOMENT AGO AND HEARD HIM CRY OUT AND THEN HE WAS GONE WITH HIS BLOOD SEEMING TO CHILL ARCHY CREPT IN THE DARKNESS CLOSE TO THE CLIFF EDGE TO FIND THAT IT SLOPED DOWN WHERE HE STOOD
WHY CONFOUND THAT BOY'S IMPUDENCE HE HAS JUMPED ON BOARD
PROCEED SHALL WE CLOSE THE MEN ALL ROUND THE HOUSE SAID THE MASTER COMING UP AFTER HALTING THE MEN
THAT'S SETTLED THEN YE-ES--I SUPPOSE SO
AND WOULD RUN A CARGO OF BRANDY OR SILK I SUPPOSE THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF SMUGGLING ON THE COAST SAID SIR RISDON COLDLY AS HE THOUGHT OF HIS VAULT
IN FACT ABOVE HIM HE COULD NOT SEE A SPOT WHERE EVEN THE SEA-BIRDS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FINDING A RESTING-PLACE
AND BESIDES IT LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM RIGHT OUT YONDER BUT ARE YOU SURE THIS IS RIGHT OH YES SIR
AS LONG AS YOU GET TO WHERE YOU CAN OVERHAUL THE BOAT WHEN SHE COMES IN YOU WON'T MIND WHERE IT IS MISTER ORFICER
WE SHALL NEVER DO IT MY LADS SAID THE MASTER SUDDENLY
STEADY MY LAD STEADY BUT I WANT TO SEE WHICH WAY THEY GO RIGHT BUT KEEP OUT OF DANGER MY LAD
UNDERSTAND DRIFT OF THE TIDE MUCH BETTER MR GURR YES SIR I WAS TRYING TO TEACH YOU TO PRONOUNCE THE KING'S ENGLISH CORRECTLY AND YOU TURN IT OFF WITH A RIBALD REMARK BEG PARDON SIR
SHE HAD HEARD OF SUCH THINGS AND IT WOULD BE VERY TERRIBLE BUT SHE MUST KNOW NOW AND THEN GO FOR HELP
AND DON'T YOU MEMBER THE BIG TUB O SUGAR AS WAS ALL SOAKED WITH WATER TILL SHE WAS LIKE TREACLE AY AND THE THAT WILL DO--THAT WILL DO CRIED THE LIEUTENANT
THE MORE SO THAT THE SUN WAS SHINING UPON HER WARMLY AND THE SEA WATER RAPIDLY QUITTING HER SKIN FOR THE DECK WHERE IT MADE A RIVULET INTO ONE OF THE SCUPPERS
HE GREW A LITTLE MORE SOFTENED IN HIS FEELINGS AND AFTER RESISTING THE TEMPTATION FOR THREE HOURS AND VOWING THAT HE WOULD KEEP TO BREAD AND WATER AND STARVE HIMSELF BEFORE HE WOULD LET THEM THINK HE RECEIVED THEIR GIFTS HE FOUND HIMSELF THINKING MORE AND MORE OF THE FRIENDLY FEELING OF THE BOY AND HIS SHOW OF GRATITUDE
DON'T MATTER HE SAID MORE CHEERFULLY
GO BACK ABOARD AND PUT ON YOUR UNIFORM
HOW IT DOES ACHE HE TURNED HIMSELF A LITTLE SO AS TO PLANT HIS BACK AGAINST THE ROCK AND LET HIS LEGS HANG DOWN OVER THE EDGE
TRUSTING MORE TO CHANCE THAN PLAN THE MIDSHIPMAN WENT ON AND ON FOLLOWING FARMER SHACKLE
LANTHORNS
THE ADVICE WAS NEEDED FOR ALL AT ONCE JUST AS ARCHY WAS LEAVING THE EDGE THERE WAS A FAINT CRY
AFTER THE SMUGGLERS HAD TAKEN POSSESSION IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT THEY HAD FILLED UP THE HOLE IN THE CLIFF FACE THOUGH IT STRUCK ARCHY THAT THIS WOULD LEAVE THEM A HANDY PLACE TO GET THEIR CARGOES ASHORE IF THEY HAD TACKLE TO HAUL IT UP AND GET IT INTO THEIR STORE AT ONCE
YES AND HIS EYES WERE BANDAGED
NONE OF OUR FELLOWS WOULD HAVE DONE THAT I SUPPOSE NOT I KNOW I WOULDN'T YES YOU WOULD RAM LOOKED THE MIDSHIPMAN HARD IN THE FACE AGAIN
ACCORDING TO HIS IDEA HE WAS AT THE END OF THE CAVE FARTHEST FROM WHERE HIS GAOLERS APPROACHED BUT UNLESS THERE WERE TWO ENTRANCES HE WAS QUITE WRONG FOR HE HAD WANDERED CLOSE UP TO THE PLACE WHENCE RAM AND JEMMY HAD COME AND THE NOISE CONTINUING HE STOOPED DOWN TO LET WHOEVER IT WAS PASS HIM WHILE HE MADE FOR THE ENTRANCE AND SLIPPED OUT
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT NONSENSE
BUT SHE'S MAKING STRAIGHT FOR THAT LEDGE AND YOU CAN'T MISS HER
AND HE EDGED HIMSELF SLOWLY ALONG TAKING HOLD OF EVERY PROMINENCE HE FOUND TO STEADY HIMSELF AND PASSING CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE ROUGH LEDGE OVER THE HOLE AND THEN ONWARD FOR FORTY OR FIFTY FEET WHERE A RIFT RAN UPWARD AND BY CAUTIOUS CLIMBING HE MOUNTED SLOWLY TILL HE WAS ON A FRESH LEDGE A FEW FEET ABOVE WHICH WAS ANOTHER RIFT AND HE CLIMBED AGAIN TO COME TO A DEPRESSION OR NICHE WHERE HE STOPPED TO REST
FEELING THAT IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE TO HIS GAOLERS ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE HE HALF LAY ON THE OLD SAIL
THE STONES WERE HARD TO MOVE AT FIRST BUT IT WAS CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO THE TOIL THROUGH WHICH THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN HAD GONE WHEN HE ATTACKED THE WALL
THERE'S SOME NICE THICK FOGS ABOUT NOW AND IT'S A QUIET SEA
WHAT BOAT'S THAT MR GURR SAID ARCHY AT LAST DRAWING THE MASTER'S ATTENTION TO ONE IN FULL SAIL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH THEY WERE GOING
THE ONLY THING THAT HE COULD SEE WAS A GULL SAILING ROUND AND ROUND BETWEEN HIM AND THE SEA DOWN TO HIS RIGHT
IT'S HARD WORK TO GET ROUND THERE WITH A BOAT
THEY MAY HIDE THE CARGO THEY LEAVE ASHORE AND IF WE DON'T CAPTURE IT SO MUCH THE WORSE BUT OUR WORK IS TO CRUSH UP THE GANG MORE THAN TO CAPTURE A FEW BARRELS AND BALES
AFRAID OF A FOX
AND THAT'S THE PLACE
BUT HOW QUEER FOR MR GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
BUT HE SAT THERE TREMBLING ALL THE SAME AND WITH A CURIOUS SENSATION OF SUFFOCATION RISING IN HIS THROAT AS HE SOFTLY ALTERED HIS POSITION AND LOOSENED HIS HANDS READY TO MAKE A SPRING AT HIS ENEMY IF IT SHOULD BECOME NECESSARY
AND THE FACT IS WE ARE AFRAID THE LAD HAS RUN ALONGSIDE O THE SMUGGLERS AND COME TO GRIEF SURELY CRIED SIR RISDON EXCITEDLY
YOU CAN CLIMB AS WELL AS THEY CAN
COME ALONG ARCHY'S HEART GAVE A BOUND
AND LOOK HERE--NEVER MIND MORE TO-DAY
LIKE ANOTHER BLANKET NO ANSWER
SPEAK TO ME
MASTER SHACKLE CRIED THE TALL THIN BARONET PITEOUSLY HOW CAN YOU TEMPT A POOR SUFFERING GENTLEMAN LIKE THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO DO YOU A BIT OF GOOD SIR RISDON AND MYSELF TOO
I WISH SHE HADN'T KISSED ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF AFTER MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE HAD SEEN
HAD HE LOST ONE
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING THAT IF I COULD BE SET ASHORE DRESSED AS ONE OF THE BOYS I MIGHT GO ABOUT UNNOTICED
IF HE WOULD ONLY KEEP TO HIS COWS AND SHEEP HERE SAID THE FARMER REOPENING THE DOOR BE OFF TO BED
BUT STILL THEY WERE NOT IN SUFFICIENT FORCE FOR THE HOZE WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY AND THE NUMBER OF KEGS KEPT INCREASING ON THE TURF AT THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
I DEALT WITH YOU AS IF YOU WERE A MAN AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN
SWUNG WELL PAST THE PROSTRATE FIGURE LOOSENED HIS GRASP ALIGHTED ON THE NARROW LEDGE QUITE CLEAR BUT COULD NOT PRESERVE HIS BALANCE AND FELL BACK UTTERING A LOW CRY AS HE TIGHTENED HIS GRASP UPON THE ROPE AGAIN BUT NOT TILL HE HAD SLIPPED RAPIDLY DOWN A GOOD TWENTY FEET WHERE HE BEGAN SWINGING TO AND FRO AGAIN
THEY WERE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND LIEUTENANT BROUGH HALTED HIS MEN MARCHED FORWARD WITH THE MIDSHIPMAN AND RAISED HIS HAT HIS SALUTE BEING FORMALLY RETURNED
I'M VERY SORRY HE SAID SADLY
BUT WHO'S GOING TO BE FRIENDS WITH A SCOUNDREL LIKE THAT
I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO
AND HE HURRIED TO WHERE A PLUMP ROSY LITTLE MAN STOOD IN FULL POST-CAPTAIN'S UNIFORM
AT LAST BEWILDERED ANXIOUS AND WORN-OUT SHE KNELT DOWN BY HER BED TO CONSIDER WITH HER HEAD IN HER HANDS READY FOR KINDLY NATURE TO BRING HER COMFORT FOR WHEN SHE STARTED UP AGAIN THE SUN WAS STREAMING BRIGHTLY IN AT HER WINDOW
WHO'S THAT CRIED ARCHY AS HE MENTALLY SAW A WOUNDED MAN BEING LEFT BEHIND
WELL THAT IS GOOD NEWS
I MUST GO OUT OF THIS DOOR AND KEEP TURNING A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT TILL I FEEL THE DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS SUPPOSE ANY ONE SHOULD HEAR HIM TAKE HIM FOR A THIEF AND FIRE AT HIM
PAIR O HANDS POPS UP OUT OF THE HOLE TAKES HOLD OF MY LEGS AND I WAS PULLED DOWN HAD A CRACK OF THE HEAD WAS DANCED ON AND HERE I AM SIR AND ME TOO SIR SAID THE OTHER VOICE
WE MUST SEARCH ALL YOUR PLACES SEARCH MY PLACES SQUIRE--CAPT'N I MEAN
NO TALKING SAID THE MASTER
BEG PARDON SIR WHO'S THAT RAYSTOKE SIR WHAT DO YOU WANT
PON MY WORD
LET'S HAVE A GAME AT CARDS ARCHY MADE NO REPLY AND RAM SIGHED
IT LOOKED LIGHT IN FRONT WHERE THE LIMESTONE ROCKS HAD GIVEN PLACE TO CHALK BUT TO RIGHT LEFT AND SEAWARD ALL WAS BLACK AS NIGHT AND STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY ALONG THE LAD APPROACHED THE COTTAGES LISTENING ATTENTIVELY BUT NOT HEARING A SOUND SAVE THE GURGLING OF WATER AS IT TRICKLED UNDER THE STONES ON ITS WAY TO THE SEA
NO ONE COULD HAVE LEAPED DOWN THAT DISTANCE ON TO A SHELF OF ROCK WITHOUT SERIOUS INJURY AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM THE REBOUND WHICH MUST HAVE SENT HIM HEADLONG INTO THE SEA BELOW
OH WELL THEN JEMMY'S RIGHT
AH LOOK AT HER
THIS WON'T DO FOR ME
HE WILL NOT BITE I'M NOT AFRAID OF HIM MISS CELIA
COOSH-COW COOSH-COW THE EFFECT WAS MAGICAL THE COW TURNED SHARPLY ROUND STRETCHED OUT HER NOSE SO AS TO MAKE HER WINDPIPE STRAIGHT AND UTTERED A LOW SOFT LOWING AS SHE WALKED STRAIGHT FORWARD TO WHERE RAM STOOD THRUST HER NOSE UNDER HIS ARM AND STOOD SWINGING HER TAIL TO AND FRO
IT IS GETTING NEARER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF SHE SAID
HE'S GRUMBLING SAID THE BOY ABOUT HAVING TO HELP WATCH OVER YOU THEN WHY NOT PUT AN END TO IT CRIED ARCHY EAGERLY DASHING INTO THE QUESTION NEXT HIS HEART FOR HIS CONFINEMENT NOW GREW UNBEARABLE
THEN THINK HOW PLEASANT A PIPE IS SIR RISDON
TCHAH HE SAID
IT WAS MANY HOURS NOW SINCE HE HAD TASTED FOOD AND IN HIS MISERY AND DESPAIR HE FELT THAT HE SHOULD BE STARVED TO DEATH BEFORE HIS GAOLERS CAME AGAIN
WHAT SHALL I DO
NO SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN TO HIMSELF SADLY
BUT WHAT'S THE MATTER
IT WOULD NOT BE THE ACT OF A FOOL TO SET ONE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE ROYAL NAVY AT LIBERTY HE SAYS IT WOULD FOR IT WOULD BE THE END OF US ALL HERE
THEN THERE WAS A FIERCE GROWL A BARK AND DIRECTLY AFTER SILENCE
IT WAS YOU FATHER KICKED FOR SHIRKING AND--MY WELL
OUT OF MY MISERY AT ALL EVENTS HE CRIED
YES I WILL GO SHE SAID
I WISH I WASN'T SUCH A COWARD SAID THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN HALF ALOUD
IF A MAN'S A LABOURER LET HIM BE A LABOURER
IF I ONLY HAD THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
D'YE HEAR BUT IN SPITE OF THE THREAT THE LAD FRENZIED NOW BY RAGE AND EXCITEMENT STRUGGLED SO HARD THAT A FRESH ROPE WAS WOUND ROUND HIM AND HE WAS LIFTED UP BY TWO MEN AND CARRIED AWAY
HE WAS IN A ROOM OVER THE CELLAR HE WAS SURE AND THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN
HAVE ME ROWED CLOSE IN TO THE SHINGLE BEACH ON THE RIGHT NOT CLOSE ASHORE BUT SO THAT I CAN WADE IN
ARCHY LISTENED PATIENTLY FOR THE NEXT MOVEMENT OF THE FARMER BUT HE COULD DETECT NOTHING AND HE WAS FEELING SURE THAT THE MAN WAS STILL WATCHING AND LISTENING WHEN HE HEARD A SNEEZE AT A DISTANCE FOLLOWED BY A MUTTERING SOUND AND KNEW THAT HE MUST HAVE MOVED OFF
CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN
MR RAYSTOKE FOLLOW ME SIR TO MY CABIN GOING TO WIG ME SAID THE MIDSHIPMAN AS HE FOLLOWED HIS OFFICER DOWN INTO THE CABIN AND SHUT THE DOOR
I WOULD LIKE TO WEAR A SWORD
COME AWAY LET GO WILL YOU GROWLED JEMMY
SHE'S A GOOD ONE IS MOTHER THAT SHE IS I'LL TELL HER YOU HAVE GIVEN UP ALL SMUGGLING AND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE A GOOD SAILOR NOW YES DO PLEASE--SIR
I AM A KING'S OFFICER AND I'VE GOT TO DO MY DUTY THEN TO KEEP THESE THOUGHTS FROM TROUBLING HIM HE BEGAN TO THINK AGAIN ABOUT THE CUTTER
THEN GIVING THE ORDERS TO SLIP THE CABLE AND PREPARE TO MAKE SAIL HE TURNED TO GURR
FOR THE TRAP-DOOR IF THAT WAS THE SPOT WHERE IT LAY WAS COVERED AND THEREFORE THE MEN COULD NOT BE IN THE CAVE
AS SHE WENT ON STOPPING TO ADMIRE THE BEAUTIFUL PURPLE THISTLES WHICH SENT UP ONE EACH A MASSIVE HEAD ON ITS SMALL STALK OR ADMIRED THE PATCHES OF DYER'S ROCKET AND THE GOLDEN TUFTS OF RAGWORT THE OLD FANCIES ABOUT THE ANCIENT QUARRIES WERE FORGOTTEN FOR THE TIME AND SHE SEATED HERSELF AT LAST UPON A PROJECTING PIECE OF STONE AWAY THERE IN THE SOLITUDE TO WATCH THE GREY GULLS AND LISTEN TO THE FAINT BEAT OF THE WAVES HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW
AND KNOWING THAT HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT WAIT TILL SHE WENT IN WHEN HE MIGHT CHANCE TO PICK UP THE CLUE AGAIN
DON'T LOOK A BIT LIKE A FISHER-LAD AND NEVER WILL NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT
GO HOME AND TELL MOTHER TO PUT A CLEAN NAPKIN IN A BASKET AND TAKE TWO ROLLS OF BUTTER A BIT OF HONEY AND A COUPLE OF CHICKENS UP TO THE HOZE YES FATHER AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY EGGS TO TAKE TOO YES FATHER
I MIGHT GET IT AND BRING THE BASKET DOWN HE SAID
GO BACK HOME WITH YOUR HORRID MEN CHAPTER TWELVE
JEE DUTCHMAN THE HORSE TUGGED AT THE TUMBRIL AND SIR RISDON WENT THOUGHTFULLY ALONG THE FIELD TOWARD A CLUMP OF TREES LYING IN A HOLLOW WHILE MASTER SHACKLE WENT ON CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF
BUT YOU DON'T THINK AS HOW A COW WOULD BE SUCH A FOOL AS TO TUMBLE OFF A CLIFF
THE LIEUTENANT NOW HAD HIMSELF ROWED WEST FOR ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE BUT IN THIS DIRECTION THEY DID NOT PASS A CRACK IN THE GREAT ROCK WALL LET ALONE A CAVE AND ONCE MORE THE GIG WAS ROWED BACK
YES I HEAR YOU HE REPLIED
WHERE ARE THEY I DON'T KNOW SIR YOU DON'T KNOW I THOUGHT THEY WERE WITH YOU AND YOU TOOK THEM AWAY AND LEFT THEM I DIDN'T TAKE THEM AWAY CRIED THE MIDSHIPMAN ANGRILY
ARCHY PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS TEMPLES AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN WILDLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE COULD NOT REACH HIS LATE ADVERSARY
BUT IT WON'T DO THIS MORNIN I'M BURST UP WITH SLEEP OPEN YOUR STUPID EYES AND LOOK FOR ONCE
I DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED
NOT IT SIR RISDON CRIED THE OTHER SO SHARPLY THAT THE GREY HORSE STARTED FORWARD AND HAD TO BE CHECKED
OH IF I COULD ONLY BE ONCE MORE ALONG WITH THE LADS AND WITH A CHANCE TO GO AT THEM
SHE'S GOING TO RUN IN UNDER THE CLIFFS WHERE THERE'S NO WIND AND OF COURSE IT'S TO TAKE UP HER LOBSTER-POTS IF SHE WAS ONLY GOING TO TAKE UP LOBSTER-POTS SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO RUN SAID ARCHY SHARPLY
WATCH AWAY
BUT--I MUST BUT I CANNOT--I CANNOT HELP YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO FETCH THE SAILORS HERE PERHAPS TO SEIZE--OH WHAT SHALL I DO THERE WAS A PAUSE BEFORE THE PRISONER SPOKE AGAIN
UP SHE COMES UP SHE"--OTHERWISE THE SUN--DID COME ROLLING SLOWLY ABOVE THE MIST-COVERED SEA RED SWOLLEN HUGE AND SENDING BLOOD-TINTED RAYS THROUGH AND THROUGH THE HAZE TO GLORIFY THE HULL SAILS AND RIGGING OF THE SMART CUTTER AND MAKE THE FACES OF THE MAN AT THE HELM AND THE OTHER WATCHERS GLOW AS WITH NEW HEALTH
WHO ARE YOU SHE ADDED UNEASILY AS SHE GLANCED AT THE LAD'S UNIFORM
THE SPIRITS HAD BURNED VIVIDLY TILL THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE WHEN THE FORCE OF THE POWDER SEEMED TO HAVE SCATTERED EVERYTHING BUT IT HAD BEEN SAVING AS WELL AS DESTRUCTIVE SEPARATING THE BRANDY KEGS SOME OF WHICH BURST AND ADDED FUEL TO THE FLAMES BUT MANY REMAINED UNTOUCHED
THROUGH THE BLACK DARKNESS NOT KNOWING WHICH WAY HE SHOULD GO PERHAPS TO FALL DOWN SOME SHAFT SUCH AS WAS SURE TO BE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN
THE MIDSHIPMAN MADE NO REPLY
THE LOW REGULAR SLOW BEAT OF GREAT SWEEPS BECAME NOW AUDIBLE BUT THOUGH RAM STRAINED HIS EYES SEAWARD NOTHING WAS VISIBLE FOR QUITE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES WHEN AS THE BOY STOOD AT THE BRINK OF THE UPPER LEDGE HE DIMLY SAW SOMETHING DARKER THAN THE MIST COMING INTO VIEW
YES MISS SAID RAM BEGINNING TO WHISTLE AS HE STRODE ALONG WITH HIS BASKET BUT HE TURNED BACK DIRECTLY AND FOLLOWED THE GIRL
IT'S ALL THROUGH HER
FROM TIME TO TIME HE PAUSED TO LISTEN AND AT LAST THOUGHT OF TRYING TO FIND THE EXTENT OF THE PLACE BY SHOUTING
SUPPOSE THE SMUGGLERS SHOULD TURN UPON US NOW THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY ONE TO TURN UPON HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
WELL WE'LL RISK IT BOY
I ORDER YOU TO TELL ME DIRECTLY
IT'S LIKE BEING A CHILD TO BE FRIGHTENED BECAUSE IT'S DARK
PRETTY RUN YOU'VE LED ME
THIS WAS QUITE AN ANCIENT MINE ONE PERHAPS FROM WHICH ALL THE BEST STONE HAD BEEN WORKED
IF NOT WITH THIS JOB WITH SOME OTHER SO THEY HALTED THE MEN POSTED ONE AT EACH END OF THE LITTLE PLACE SO AS TO COMMAND A GOOD VIEW OF ANY ONE ATTEMPTING TO CARRY OFF CONTRABAND GOODS AND WENT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE THE PEOPLE READILY SUBMITTING TO THE INTRUSION AND SEARCH WHICH IN EACH CASE WAS WITHOUT RESULT
HE HAD BEEN GROWING DULL AND DISHEARTENED THINKING THAT HIS EXPEDITION WAS FOOLISH AND IMPOSSIBLE AND HERE AT ONCE HE HAD LEARNED WHAT HE WANTED
PHEW PANTED DICK
AND HE HEARD QUITE PLAINLY AS HE CLUNG TO THE ROUGH STEPS AND PRESSED HIS EAR AGAINST THE TRAP-DOOR THE EAGER SCRATCHING MADE BY A DOG AND THE SNUFFLING NOISE AS IT TRIED TO THRUST ITS NOSE DOWN AMONGST THE STONES
I SAW YOU AND EVER SO MANY MORE COME UP WITH LITTLE BARRELS SLUNG OVER THEIR SHOULDERS RAM'S FACE WAS A STUDY IN THE COMIC LINE AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
DON'T I WISH I'D GOT ONE OF MOTHER'S BASKETS FULL OF GOOD STUFF WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER ASKED ARCHY
WILL YOU SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE HOUSE
RAMILLIES KNOW NOT YET DON'T TELL HIM
NOW THEN WHERE WILL IT BE FROM HERE GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND I'LL LEAD YOU RIGHT TO IT THERE YOU ARE
FOR IT SEEMED SO SHOCKING THAT THE NOBLE-LOOKING LADY AND GENTLEMAN HE HAD SEEN THAT DAY SHOULD BE IN LEAGUE WITH A GANG OF SMUGGLERS AND HAVE LENT THEIR OUT-OF-THE-WAY HOUSE TO BE A DEPOSITORY FOR THE CONTRABAND GOODS
IT WOULD BE A PITY
I DIDN'T MEAN IT WAS MY OWN CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME PROOF THAT IT IS YOURS SAID THE LIEUTENANT
FOR ONE MINUTE SHE PAUSED STRUCK BY THE PECULIAR SWEET AND SICKLY ODOUR OF A LARGE-LEAVED HERB WHICH SHE HAD CRUSHED AND ADMIRED ITS BEAUTIFULLY VEINED BLOSSOMS IN HAPPY IGNORANCE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE DEADLY POISONOUS HENBANE AND THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE MISSED GRIP
BUT HE HAD THE PERMISSION AND CALLING TO A COUPLE OF THE CREW HE SOON HAD THE SMALL BOAT IN THE WATER WITH DICK AND ANOTHER MAN PULLING TOWARDS WHERE THE COW WAS SLOWLY SWIMMING HERE AND THERE WITH ITS WET NOSE AND TWO HORNS A VERY SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE THE SURFACE
WELL SIR HE SAID STERNLY YOU HAVE YOUR DUTY TO DO
MR RAY--OH MY DEAR BOY THERE WAS NOT A BIT OF OFFICIAL DIGNITY IN THE GREETING FOR THE PLUMP LITTLE LIEUTENANT IN HIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT CAUGHT ARCHY BY THE ARMS THEN BY THE SHOULDERS
YOU TWO OTHERS HE CONTINUED DRAW CUTLASSES AND KEEP GUARD OVER THE PRISONERS HIS ORDERS WERE OBEYED AND THE TWO MEN STOOD BY GUARDING RAM JEMMY AND THE COW WHO BLINKED HER EYES AND SMELT AT THE SEA WATER FROM TIME TO TIME RAISED HER HEAD AND UTTERED A SOFT LOW WHICH WAS ANSWERED FROM THE GREEN TOP OF THE CLIFF TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THEM WHERE ANOTHER COW STOOD GAZING DOWN
GLORIOUS YES
THAT OLD CHAP HAVING A GLASS OF REAL SMUGGLED SPIRITS HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS BECAUSE I TASTED IT
IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD FIND SUCH A SPOT FOR THE LEDGE HAD GROWN NARROWER AND IN ANOTHER YARD DIED COMPLETELY AWAY
I AM A KING'S OFFICER HE SHOUTED AND ORDER YOU TO LET ME GO HEAR THAT JEMMY
HAVE A BIT O THIS
I MUST TELL ABOUT ALL THOSE SMUGGLED THINGS THERE IN THE CELLAR THAT NIGHT WHEN YOU FOUND ME IN THAT ROOM--OUT OF UNIFORM AH EJACULATED CELIA
HE'D HAVE SHOT HIM
AY AY SHOUTED THE MEN WHO THE MOMENT BEFORE WERE MAD WITH TERROR BUT WHO LEAPED AT THE COMMAND AS IF THEIR SAFETY WERE ASSURED
ARCHY SHUDDERED HIS EYES GREW FIXED AND HIS WHOLE BODY SEEMED TO BE FROZEN
I WON'T GO BACK TO PRISON
THE HOZE THE HOZE YES
OH I WISH I HAD HIM HERE THE INTENTION WAS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUNISHMENT BUT JUST THEN ARCHY KICKED AGAINST THE BASKET AND THAT COMPLETELY CHANGED THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS
WELL I SEE BRAMBRYS AND MASHEROONS
SALT BEEF THEN SALT PORK AND HARD BISCUITS
AS HE REACHED THE TRACK LEADING PAST THE COTTAGES HE HAD A NARROW ESCAPE FROM FALLING OVER A BOAT THAT WAS DRAWN UP ON THE STONES BUT HE SAVED HIMSELF WITH A JERK
GO ON JUST AS USUAL AND DON'T TELL HIM NOTHING
THEY'LL LAND A PARTY AND COME AND SEARCH
WHAT WAS THE GOOD I KNOWED YOU WOULDN'T
BE OFF AND DON'T BOTHER ME AGAIN THERE WAS A RUSTLING SOUND AND A DEEP-TONED BREATHING THAT SOME RUDE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CALLED A SNORE
THEY MUST PROMOTE ME NOW AND DRAFT YOU TOO INTO A GOOD SHIP
THERE YOU ARE HE CONTINUED
SHE WALKED STEADILY ON FINDING A BUTTON MUSHROOM HERE AND A BUNCH OF BLACKBERRIES THERE
WHERE ARE YOU FROM OUT O MY BOAT AS IS MADE FAST LONGSIDE
LET RAM PLAY WHAT TRICKS HE LIKES HE SAID I KNOW WHERE I AM NOW WELL MY LAD WELL PANTED GURR RUNNING UP FOLLOWED BY THE MEN
BY THE WAY WE MUST GO STRAIGHT DOWN THERE AND SEE IF THE PLACE IS COOL ENOUGH TO SEARCH
GRIP
GRIP
NOTHING SIR ONLY YOU SAID IT WAS STRANGE WELL ISN'T IT STRANGE AY SIR
SCARED ABOUT WHOM BEG PARDON DIDN'T MEAN NOWT SIR SAID THE SAILOR TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK
HE WALKED FORWARD
THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO THE CUTTER AND THIS EVENING A STRONG PARTY SHALL LAND
THE COWARDS CRIED ARCHY AS HE FULLY REALISED THAT HIS GAOLERS HAD ESCAPED FROM HIM
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE ME AND IMPRISON ME SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY MUST NOW KNOW THAT I WAS HOLDING COMMUNICATIONS WITH THAT GIRL NOW THEN STEADY SAID A VOICE AS HE FELT THAT THE COOL AIR WAS COMING DOWN ON TO HIS HEAD AND HE BREATHED IT THROUGH THE THICK SACKING
AT THIS MOMENT AFTER EXCITEDLY WATCHING THEM THE MIDSHIPMAN BECAME CONVINCED
YOU MEAN IF I'D SEEN YOU LYING DOWN HERE LIKE I WAS I SHOULD HAVE GONE AND FETCHED THE ROPE AND PULLED YOU UP YES
THE TIME SEEMED VERY LONG BEFORE THE RATTLE AND RUMBLE OF THE STONES ON THE TRAP-DOOR STRUCK UPON ARCHY'S LISTENING EAR BUT AT LAST AFTER HE HAD CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE MIGHT HAVE WORKED TWO OR THREE HOURS LONGER THERE IT WAS AND THEN CAME THE RATTLE OF THE BOLTS AND THE SHARP SOUND OF THE LOCK
FOR SOME MINUTES HE FELT GIDDY
HE EVEN THOUGHT OF HOW GLORIOUS IT WOULD BE FOR THERE TO COME A STORM WITH THE SPRAY BEATING ON HIS CHEEKS AND THEN AS HE INVOLUNTARILY RAISED HIS HAND TO HIS FACE A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM WHICH MADE HIM START
THIS ROPE'S LONG ENOUGH AND WE SHALL HAVE TO SLIDE DOWN INTO A BOAT BUT THE CUTTER WAS LONG
CAN'T FORD TO LOSE FIFTY POUNDS FOR FEAR O GETTING ONE'S FEET COLD
SHOW ME THE WAY OUT OF THIS PLACE DIRECTLY RAM LAD SAID JEMMY DADD WITH A CACKLING LAUGH
I DON'T COME TO SELL
DO HAVE SOME ARCHY GROUND HIS TEETH
BUT SOMEHOW SEEMED TO NEED QUITE A LARGE STAFF OF LABOURERS TO KEEP IT IN SUCH BAD ORDER
WE'RE ON THE WRONG TACK MR RAYSTOKE SIR HE WHISPERED
THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH I COULD ALLOW MYSELF TO ACT WAS TO KEEP MYSELF IN COMPLETE IGNORANCE OF THE GOING AND COMING OF THESE PEOPLE
THE WORK WAS MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED AND TWICE HE SLIPPED ONCE SO BADLY THAT HE WAS HOLDING ON MERELY BY THE SHARP EDGE OF A PROJECTING PIECE OF STONE BUT HE FOUND FOOTHOLD AGAIN DREW HIMSELF UP AND WENT ON CLIMBING AGAIN TILL WITH FACE STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION AND HIS FINGERS WET WITH BLOOD OF WHICH HE LEFT TRACES ON THE STONE AS HE WENT ON HE AT LAST REACHED THE OPENING HE HAD FOUGHT SO HARD TO MAKE CLIMBED IN TURNED AND LEANED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD TO TRY AND GET A GLIMPSE OF RAM AND BE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT GLIDED INTO THE SEA
NOW FOR A REST AND THEN DOWN AGAIN HE STEPPED TO THE EDGE AND LOOKED OVER IN THE MIDDLE NEXT TO THE LEFT THEN TO THE RIGHT AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT
I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THERE WAS NOT ONE
YOU ARE MAKING A MISTAKE SAID ARCHY SOFTLY
IT'S OF NO USE TO CALL UPON THEM TO SURRENDER SAID GURR RATHER BREATHLESSLY AS THEY TOILED UP THE ZIGZAG
SHOULD HE TRY THE CHIMNEY
JUST IN FRONT AFTER THE MEN ABOUT HIM HAD BEEN TALKING MORE LOUDLY AS IF CLEAR OF DANGER THERE RANG OUT A STERN HALT--STAND THERE WAS A HASTY EXCLAMATION
ANY WAY HE SAID AT LAST FOR I WILL HAVE IT
NOTHER BUCKET YOU SIR FETCH ANOTHER BUCKET SAID THE LIEUTENANT SHARPLY
