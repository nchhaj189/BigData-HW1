A COUNCILLOR RAN IN WITH A COPY OF KERENSKY'S PROCLAMATION DROPPED BY HUNDREDS FROM AN AEROPLANE LOW FLYING DOWN THE NEVSKY WHICH THREATENED TERRIBLE VENGEANCE ON ALL WHO DID NOT SUBMIT AND ORDERED SOLDIERS TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND ASSEMBLE IMMEDIATELY IN MARS FIELD
RUMOURS RAN THROUGH THE CITY THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ARMED DEMONSTRATION A VYSTUPLENNIE_--"COMING OUT OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
KERENSKY TELEPHONED FROM TSARSKOYE TO REFUSE ALL PARLEY WITH THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
CHAPTER V PLUNGING AHEAD THURSDAY NOVEMBER 8TH
BUT THE HONEYMOON WAS SHORT
THERE WAS NO HEAT IN THE HALL BUT THE STIFLING HEAT OF UNWASHED HUMAN BODIES
I ALSO WILL WRITE
IT HAS ADDRESSED ITSELF TO THE BUREAU OF THE COMMITTEE WITH THE REQUEST AT ONCE TO CONVOKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE FULFILMENT OF THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMME
ONLY TWO DAYS AGO THE PETROGRAD CAMPAGNA WAS FULL OF LEADERLESS BANDS WANDERING AIMLESSLY
IT WAS THEY WHO HAD TURNED THE TIDE IN THE GREAT DAYS OF MARCH CREATED THE SOVIETS OF SOLDIERS DEPUTIES AND HURLED BACK KORNILOV FROM THE GATES OF PETROGRAD
ZINOVIEV ATTEMPTING TO SPEAK FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS HOOTED DOWN AND AS HE LEFT THE PLATFORM AMID LAUGHTER THERE WERE CRIES THERE'S HOW A PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR SITS IN A MUDPUDDLE WE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES REFUSE CRIED NAZARIEV A DELEGATE FROM THE PROVINCES TO RECOGNISE THIS SO-CALLED WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE PEASANTS ARE REPRESENTED IN IT
GRAPHIC PAGE 287
THE CONGRESS CALLS UPON THE SOLDIERS IN THE TRENCHES TO BE WATCHFUL AND STEADFAST
THE CONGRESS WAS TO MEET AT ONE O'CLOCK AND LONG SINCE THE GREAT MEETING-HALL HAD FILLED BUT BY SEVEN THERE WAS YET NO SIGN OF THE PRESIDIUM
WE PROPOSE TO THE CONGRESS TO RATIFY THIS DECLARATION
STEADILY AMID THE CHAOS OF SHOCKING CHANGE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HAMMERED AT THE SCAFFOLDING OF THE SOCIALIST ORDER
FULL REESTABLISHMENT OF DISCIPLINARY POWER IN THE HANDS OF OFFICERS WITH RIGHT OF REVIEW OF SENTENCE
WAS IT TRUE THAT PEOPLE IN A FREE COUNTRY SOLD THEIR VOTES FOR MONEY IF SO HOW DID THEY GET WHAT THEY WANTED
IN THE NAME OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR NATIONALITIES YUSSOV DJUGASHVILI-STALIN PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS V
LIKE A WAVE THEY RUSHED DOWN CLASPING THE PEASANTS IN THEIR ARMS AND KISSING THEM
INSIDE WAS A PRODIGIOUS RUNNING-ABOUT OF PEOPLE WITH ARMFULS OF SOLDATSKI GOLOS LOOKING FOR PLACES TO HIDE THEM
20 AND RECEIVED BY THE SOLDIERS EVERYWHERE WITH TREMENDOUS OVATIONS--A TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS
A LARGE SECTION OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES PREFERRED THE GERMANS TO THE REVOLUTION--EVEN TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT--AND DIDN'T HESITATE TO SAY SO
TWO SENTINELS TRIED TO STOP US BUT WE BRUSHED BY HURRIEDLY DEAF TO THEIR INDIGNANT EXPOSTULATIONS
OF THE DISTRICT SOVIETS--OF PUTILOV FACTORY WHICH READ WE BOW TO THIS FLAG IN ORDER TO CREATE THE BROTHERHOOD OF ALL PEOPLE FROM SOMEWHERE TORCHES APPEARED BLAZING ORANGE IN THE NIGHT A THOUSAND TIMES REFLECTED IN THE FACETS OF THE ICE STREAMING OUT SMOKILY OVER THE THRONG AS IT MOVED DOWN THE BANK OF THE FONTANKA SINGING BETWEEN CROWDS THAT STOOD IN ASTONISHED SILENCE
THROUGH THE CLOUDED WINDOWS A PALE LIGHT STREAMED
TO POSTS OF A TECHNICAL CHARACTER DEMANDING SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OR OTHER PRACTICAL PREPARATION NAMELY
DOESN'T THE LAND DECREE SETTLE THE PEASANTS
YOU HAVE NARROWLY ESCAPED HE KEPT MUTTERING WIPING HIS FACE
THE SCHOOL FOR ADULTS MUST OCCUPY A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE GENERAL PLAN OF POPULAR INSTRUCTION
IS THAT SO WE REPLIED POLITELY
NOT ONLY THESE BOLSHEVIKI HE SAID BUT THE FINE TRADITIONS OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY ARE BROKEN DOWN
APPEALS AND DENUNCIATIONS APPEAL TO ALL CITIZENS AND TO THE MILITARY ORGANISATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
FAR OVER THE STILL ROOFS WESTWARD CAME THE SOUND OF SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE WHERE THE YUNKERS WERE TRYING TO OPEN THE BRIDGES OVER THE NEVA TO PREVENT THE FACTORY WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE VIBORG QUARTER FROM JOINING THE SOVIET FORCES IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
WILLIAMS OFFERED TO MEDIATE IF ANTONOV WERE RELEASED
GIRL AFTER GIRL FLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT THE APPLAUSE OF THE NICE PEOPLE OF PETROGRAD OF THE OFFICERS THE RICH THE GREAT NAMES OF POLITICS--GIRL AFTER GIRL TO NARRATE HER SUFFERINGS AT THE HANDS OF THE PROLETARIAT AND PROCLAIM HER LOYALTY TO ALL THAT WAS OLD ESTABLISHED AND POWERFUL
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS SUMMONS THE PEASANTS TO TAKE THE WHOLE POWER INTO THEIR HANDS IN EVERY LOCALITY
RECENTLY KUHLMAN SAID THAT A PERSONAL DECLARATION BOUND ONLY HIM WHO MADE IT
THROUGH HIS CLOTHES FRESH BLOOD CAME WELLING UP WITH EVERY HEART-BEAT
I UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN THAT AN AGREEMENT IS BEING CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE PEASANTS CONGRESS AND SMOLNY
SKOBELIEV
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAMBER THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ADVOCATED IMMEDIATE PEACE LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY--PRACTICALLY THE BOLSHEVIK PROGRAMME

THE SO-CALLED PEACE CONFERENCE AT BERNE SWITZERLAND DURING THE SUMMER OF 1917 IN WHICH DELEGATES PARTICIPATED FROM ALL BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES REPRESENTING LARGE FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES
IN THE NAME OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH SKOBELIEV INSISTED THAT THE NAKAZ BE PRESENTED AT THE ALLIED CONFERENCE AND FORMALLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE SENDING OF TERESTCHENKO TO PARIS
PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIS PROVOCATION

12 COUCHED IN SIMPLE WORDS AND SPREAD OVER RUSSIA LENIN EXPLAINED THE REVOLUTION URGED THE PEOPLE TO TAKE THE POWER INTO THEIR OWN HANDS BY FORCE TO BREAK DOWN THE RESISTANCE OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES BY FORCE TO TAKE OVER THE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT
AT TEN IN THE EVENING LENIN ADDRESSED A MEETING OF DELEGATES FROM THE CITY REGIMENTS WHO VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO FIGHT
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE PALACE EXCEPT THE COMMISSARS UNTIL WE GET SENTRIES POSTED TWO RED GUARDS A SOLDIER AND AN OFFICER STOOD WITH REVOLVERS IN THEIR HANDS
THE HOURS IN WHICH WE LIVE APPEAR IN THE MOST TRAGIC COLOURS HE SAID
REAL
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD NOT DO TO RESTORE THE SAINT
M I WAS SUMMONED BY THE SUPREME COMMANDER KERENSKY HE WAS VERY AGITATED AND VERY NERVOUS
ALL OFFICERS WHO ACT WITHOUT ORDERS FROM THEIR SUPERIORS WILL BE COURT-MARTIALLED FOR MUTINY
LITHUANIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SUPPORT
AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT
COMRADES HE CRIED
ANY ATTEMPT TO DO SO WOULD INEVITABLY BRING ON A REACTION BY MEANS OF WHICH SOME RUTHLESS OPPORTUNIST MIGHT RESTORE THE OLD REGIME
FOR THAT REASON IT HAS DECIDED NOT TO SUBMIT AND TO DEMAND AID FROM THE POPULATION AND THE ARMY
THERE IS THE STORY OF SENATOR SOKOLOV WHO IN FULL TIDE OF REVOLUTION CAME TO A MEETING OF THE SENATE ONE DAY IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND WAS NOT ADMITTED BECAUSE HE DID NOT WEAR THE PRESCRIBED LIVERY OF THE TSAR'S SERVICE
CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD WE THE BOLSHEVIK MUNICIPAL COUNCILLORS ELECTED BY YOU--WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE CADETS ARE ENGAGED IN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ACTION HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR DUTY AND ARE LEADING THE POPULATION TO FAMINE TO CIVIL WAR
AS I CAME IN THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY KARELIN WAS READING ALOUD AN EDITORIAL FROM THE LONDON TIMES WHICH SAID THE REMEDY FOR BOLSHEVISM IS BULLETS TURNING TO THE CADETS HE CRIED THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK TOO VOICES FROM THE RIGHT YES
THEY MAKE GOLDEN PROMISES TO THE MASSES KNOWING IN ADVANCE THAT THEY CAN FULFIL NONE OF THEM
FROM AFAR THE VAGUE STIRRING SOUND DEEPENED AND BECAME LOUDER A STEADY AND TREMENDOUS BASS
| 4
| 4
ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS BESIDE THOSE PERTAINING TO THE COMMAND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF POSTS IN THE ECONOMIC DEPARTMENTS ARE FILLED BY APPOINTMENT OF THE RESPECTIVE ELECTED COMMANDERS
THAT IS DISHONEST
THIS TENDENCY TO STRIKE AT THE VITAL INTERESTS OF RUSSIA MUST BE CHECKED
SOON SOON ANSWERED A SOLDIER NERVOUSLY
IT WAS THE FASHION AMONG THOROUGH-GOING INTERNATIONALISTS TO ABOLISH ALL NAMES WHICH SMACKED OF PATRIOTISM
I BOUGHT A COPY OF RABOTCHI PUT THE ONLY NEWSPAPER WHICH SEEMED ON SALE AND A LITTLE LATER PAID A SOLDIER FIFTY KOPEKS FOR A SECOND-HAND COPY OF DIEN THE BOLSHEVIK PAPER PRINTED ON LARGE-SIZED SHEETS IN THE CONQUERED OFFICE OF THE RUSSKAYA VOLIA HAD HUGE HEADLINES
HOW ABOUT THIS TAMMANY
NO ANSWERED MY FRIEND
KARELIN DECLARED THAT THE TSAY-EE-KAH HAD NO RIGHT TO PASS UPON THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH SHOULD BE LEFT TO A SPECIAL COMMITTEE
DURING TEA WE ASKED THE ELEVEN PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WHETHER THEY PREFERRED WILHELM OR THE BOLSHEVIKI THE VOTE WAS TEN TO ONE FOR WILHELM
I RETURNED TO THE SOVIET PALACE IN TSARSKOYE IN THE REGIMENTAL STAFF AUTOMOBILE
1 NOTHING THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD DONE COULD COMPARE WITH THIS FEARFUL BLASPHEMY IN THE HEART OF HOLY RUSSIA
PRECEDED BY TWO CHAPTERS BRIEFLY OUTLINING THE BACKGROUND AND CAUSES OF THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION
HERE IS AN AMERICAN COMRADE
ONLY AS THE RESULT OF SUCH A TRUST CAN THERE BE FORMED AN HONEST AND LASTING UNION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA
I WILL DO THAT GENERAL I WILL GIVE YOU A GUARD AND ASK THAT A SAILOR GO WITH YOU NO NO NOT A SAILOR
TO ALL WORKERS OF PETROGRAD COMRADES
THE WAR BEGUN IN PETROGRAD--IS THE DEATH OF THE REVOLUTION
WILL YOU THEY ASKED PROMISE TO DIVIDE THE GREAT ESTATES OF THE COSSACK LANDLORDS AMONG THE WORKING COSSACKS ONLY OVER MY DEAD BODY RESPONDED KALEDIN
FOR EXAMPLE PETER THE GREAT'S TABEL O RANGOV--_TABLE OF RANKS--WHICH HE RIVETTED UPON RUSSIA WITH AN IRON HAND STILL HELD SWAY
FOR EMPHASIS HE BENT FORWARD SLIGHTLY
A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE IN FAVOUR OF GIVING WAY SO FAR AS TO CREATE A JOINT ALL-SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT
LOOK AT THEIR TICKETS
BUT THE FORCES OF THE REVOLUTION BY FAR EXCEED THOSE OF ITS ENEMIES
INDEMNITIES ALL COMBATANTS TO RENOUNCE DEMANDS FOR ANY INDEMNITIES EITHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT--AS FOR INSTANCE CHARGES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF PRISONERS
THEY ARE READY TO JOIN THE BOLSHEVIKI AND WITH THEM FAN THE DISORDERS INTO CIVIL WAR
THE PRESIDENT OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS VLADIMIR ILYITCH LENIN
EACH HOUR OF DELAY MAY COST THE LIFE OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS
THE SOLDIERS AT THE CAMP OF COURTINE RECEIVED SEVERAL TIMES THE VISIT OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE RUSSIAN ARMIES ABROAD OF RAPP THE COMMISSAR OF THE MINISTRY OF WAR AND OF SEVERAL DISTINGUISHED FORMER EXILES WHO WISHED TO INFLUENCE THEM BUT THESE ATTEMPTS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND FINALLY COMMISSAR RAPP INSISTED THAT THE REBELS LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND IN SIGN OF SUBMISSION MARCH IN GOOD ORDER TO A PLACE CALLED CLAIRVAUX
THEY HAVE COME HERE TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR COUNTRYMEN ABOUT THE BRAVERY AND THE REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE OF THE PROLETARIAN ARMY HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT REPLIED THE BIG SOLDIER
THEY WILL NEVER ACCEPT THE PROPOSITION OF A PEACE CONFERENCE FROM YOU YOU WILL NOT BE RECOGNISED EITHER IN LONDON AND PARIS OR IN BERLIN
I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE EVEN FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES AT SMOLNY A SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY FRIEND OF MINE DREW ME ASIDE
ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE SQUARE THE DARK TOWERS AND WALLS OF THE KREMLIN STOOD UP
EVENTS OF THE NIGHT NOVEMBER 6TH TOWARD EVENING BANDS OF RED GUARDS BEGAN TO OCCUPY THE PRINTING SHOPS OF THE BOURGEOIS PRESS WHERE THEY PRINTED RABOTCHI PUT SOLDAT AND VARIOUS PROCLAMATIONS BY THE HUNDRED THOUSAND
IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SHOUTED GRABBING MY HANDS
FOR THE NORTHERN FRONT POZERN
THEY EXPLAINED TO KERENSKY THAT IT WAS NOT MEANT AS A CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT
THE THREE GREATEST OF THEM WERE NOT THERE
AS IF BY MAGIC THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH WARNINGS SEE APP
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD SUPPRESSED BOLSHEVIK PAPERS BEFORE IN JULY AND WAS PLANNING TO DO SO AGAIN
WHAT CLASS OF SOCIETY DO YOU BELONG TO THEY ASKED HIM
LABOR SHLIAPNIKOV
THREE WEEKS AGO THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDERS OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
ALL WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THIS NAKAZ BEING THE EXPRESSION OF THE INDISPUTABLE WILL OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF CONSCIOUS PEASANTS OF RUSSIA IS DECLARED TO BE A TEMPORARY LAW AND UNTIL THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY BECOMES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY SO FAR AS IS POSSIBLE AND IN SOME PARTS OF IT GRADUALLY AS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE DISTRICT SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES
ALL THE TROUBLED NIGHT OVER THE BLEAKFLATS LEADERLESS BANDS OF SOLDIERS AND RED GUARDS WANDERED CLASHING AND CONFUSED AND THE COMMISSARS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HURRIED FROM ONE GROUP TO ANOTHER TRYING TO ORGANISE A DEFENCE
YOU ARE BEING INCITED AGAINST THE PEOPLE
GO ON PRAVILNO OR ETO VIERNO THAT'S TRUE
AND FINALLY THE BOLSHEVIKI PROMISE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE AWAY OUR LAND
ON THE TOP FLOOR THE MANAGER SHOWED US WHERE SHRAPNEL HAD SHATTERED SEVERAL WINDOWS
OUR ARTILLERY ANSWERED AND COMPELLED THE ENEMY TO BE SILENT
THE SOLDIER SAYS SHOW ME WHAT I AM FIGHTING FOR
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IS DEPOSED
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IS DEPOSED
AN AUTOMOBILE STOOD WITH RACING ENGINE AT THE KERB
ALL THE NECESSARY ORDERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO CRUSH MERCILESSLY THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ATTEMPT AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND ITS CONQUESTS
WHY THEN DID NOT THE NEW GOVERNMENT FOLLOW THE TACTICS OUTLINED BY THAT CONGRESS
AND IT IS AS PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT WE MUST EXAMINE THE QUESTION OF THE PRESS THEREUPON HE READ THE OFFICIAL BOLSHEVIK RESOLUTION
YOUR GOVERNMENT STILL EXISTS
THE PAID INSERTION OF ADVERTISEMENTS
EVERY SOLDIER EVERY WORKER EVERY REAL SOCIALIST EVERY HONEST DEMOCRAT REALISES THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES TO THE PRESENT SITUATION
RUDNEV THE MAYOR AND MINOR PRESIDENT OF THE DUMA HAD DIRECTED THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE TROOPS
NO STRIKES
FOR MILK AND BREAD AND SUGAR AND TOBACCO ONE HAD TO STAND IN QUEUE LONG HOURS IN THE CHILL RAIN
ACT BY MEANS OF ARGUMENTS BY MEANS OF MORAL SUASION--BUT IF THAT FAILS HALT THE MOVEMENT OF TROOPS BY IMPLACABLE FORCE
DAN GOTZ AND AVKSENTIEV THE LEADERS OF THE COMPROMISERS PERFORMED THEIR LAST COMPROMISE
AT A DESK IN ONE CORNER WAS ROGOV AN INTELLIGENT BEARDED MAN WITH GLASSES WEARING THE BLACK BLOUSE OF A WORKER
COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES FROM AN INTERNATIONAL FUND
NOT A WORKER WILL LOSE A SINGLE KOPEK
KHARASH WEARING THE EPAULETS OF A CAPTAIN PASSIONATELY DEMANDED THE FLOOR
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY V
ABSURD
GO AHEAD
4 FOR GUIDANCE DURING THE REALISATION OF THE GREAT LAND REFORMS UNTIL THEIR FINAL RESOLUTION BY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY SHALL SERVE THE FOLLOWING PEASANT NAKAZ SEE APP
IT WAS NOT THEIR MOOD
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HE SAT ON A ROUGH CHAIR AT A BARE TABLE
ADZHEMOV FOR THE CADETS DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO TELL THE ARMY WHAT IT WAS FIGHTING FOR SINCE EVERY SOLDIER OUGHT TO REALISE THAT THE FIRST TASK WAS TO DRIVE THE ENEMY FROM RUSSIAN TERRITORY
THE SOLDIER'S AND THE COSSACK'S BLOOD IS NOT FLOWING THERE ANY MORE
OH YES I AM A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
IT HAD BEEN A MOMENTOUS SESSION
OF THE EXACT SITE OF THEIR STORES
THE CLUTCH SLID HOME WITH A RAKING JAR THE GREAT CAR JERKED FORWARD WE ALL TOPPLED BACKWARD ON TOP OF THOSE WHO WERE CLIMBING IN
GUARANTEES OF PEACE PEACE IS TO BE CONCLUDED AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE BY DELEGATES ELECTED BY THE NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS OF EACH COUNTRY
INFLUENTIAL CADETS WERE TO BE SEEN HOVERING AROUND THE MUNICIPAL DUMA AND ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
CHAPTER 10
BECAUSE THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE ARE ECONOMICALLY EXHAUSTED,--AND BECAUSE THEY ARE DISILLUSIONED WITH THE ALLIES THE INTERVIEW OF WHICH THIS IS AN EXCERPT WAS CABLED TO THE UNITED STATES AND IN A FEW DAYS SENT BACK BY THE AMERICAN STATE DEPARTMENT WITH A DEMAND THAT IT BE ALTERED THIS KERENSKY REFUSED TO DO
ALL LANDLORDS TITLES TO THE LAND ARE CANCELLED BY THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
EVERY CONSCIOUS WORKER UNDERSTANDS PERFECTLY THAT WE CANNOT AVOID THIS HOSTILITY BECAUSE THE HIGH OFFICIALS HAVE SET THEMSELVES AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND DO NOT WISH TO ABANDON THEIR POSTS WITHOUT RESISTANCE
THE PETTY BOURGEOISIE IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WOULD COMBINE WITH THE DEVIL HIMSELF HE SAID ONCE
IF WE HAVE SURVIVED THE BLACKEST DAYS IN THE LIFE AND HISTORY OF OUR PEOPLE IF WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING FAMINE IN PETROGRAD IF WE HAVE MANAGED TO PROCURE TO THE SUFFERING ARMY BREAD AND FORAGE BY MEANS OF ENORMOUS ALMOST SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE HONESTLY CONTINUED AND ARE STILL CONTINUING TO DO OUR WORK
PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF CANNOT FIGHT ON EITHER SIDE IN SUCH A WAR AS THIS NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE MAY INSTINCTIVELY DISLIKE THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE MOB
THIS IS BEST EXPRESSED BY WORKERS CONTROL OVER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WHICH NATURALLY AROSE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF ECONOMIC DECOMPOSITION CREATED BY THE CRIMINAL POLICY OF THE DOMINATING CLASSES
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE ARISES TERRIBLE AND MAJESTIC LOOKING AT THIS MOMENT LIKE ROBESPIERRE
ARMY COMMITTEES THE ARMY COMMITTEES WERE FORMED BY THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT TO COMBAT THE REACTIONARY INFLUENCE OF THE OLD REGIME OFFICERS
OUR PAPERS FROM SMOLNY HAD NO EFFECT HOWEVER SO WE APPROACHED ANOTHER PART OF THE LINE WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND SHOWED OUR AMERICAN PASSPORTS SAYING OFFICIAL BUSINESS AND SHOULDERED THROUGH
TROOPS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE OCCUPY THE STRATEGIC POINTS OF THE CITY
THE BOLSHEVIKI WHILE APPEALING FOR PEACE AT THE FRONT ARE INCITING TO CIVIL WAR IN THE REAR
MONARCHIST PLOTS GERMAN SPIES SMUGGLERS HATCHING SCHEMES
AS FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT OUGHT TO SPRING FROM THE POPULAR WILL
NOTHING BUT A HANDFUL OF POOR FOOLS DECEIVED BY LENIN AND TROTZKY
THE OLD MAYOR IN HIS DIGNIFIED WAY WAS PROTESTING AGAINST THE APPEAL OF THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS
WE MUST ELECT A DELEGATION TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES AND ORGANISATION ALWAYS THE METHODICAL MUFFLED BOOM OF CANNON THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND THE DELEGATES SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER
PEOPLE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TOWARD THE CLOUDED WINDOWS AND A SORT OF FEVER CAME OVER THEM
A PROCLAMATION OF THE FINLAND REGIMENT IN DECEMBER 1917 ANNOUNCING DESPERATE REMEDIES FOR WINE POGROMS FOR TRANSLATION SEE APPENDIX 5
IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC THE GULF BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE CHAMBER DEEPENED DAY BY DAY
IT WAS A MEMORIAL WRITTEN BY SOME SOLDIER TO HIS COMRADES FALLEN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST KERENSKY JUST AS HE HAD SET IT DOWN BEFORE FALLING ON THE FLOOR TO SLEEP
THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD A COMPARATIVELY SMALL FOLLOWING AMONG THE PEASANTS
LET THE COMPROMISERS ACCEPT OUR PROGRAMME AND THEY CAN COME IN
NEXT DAY THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND THE MORNING AFTER THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE OF WHOM ONE HUNDRED AND THREE WERE BOLSHEVIKI
AND SO DEVELOPED IN RUSSIA IN THE MIDST OF A FOREIGN WAR THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION ON TOP OF THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION CULMINATING IN THE TRIUMPH OF BOLSHEVISM
A HAIL OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE SWEPT THE QUARTERS OF THE GREAT BANKS AND COMMERCIAL HOUSES
MEASURES MUST BE TAKEN TO GUARD AGAINST THIS
THE MORE THE TENDENCY LIES IN THIS LATTER DIRECTION THE SOONER DISAPPEARS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOVIETS
AMONG THEIR LEADERS
THE MONEY IN THE STATE BANK IS YOURS THE PEOPLE'S MONEY ACQUIRED BY YOUR LABOUR YOUR SWEAT AND BLOOD
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT IN A CERTAIN UPSTAIRS ROOM SAT A THIN-FACED LONG-HAIRED INDIVIDUAL ONCE AN OFFICER IN THE ARMIES OF THE TSAR THEN REVOLUTIONIST AND EXILE A CERTAIN AVSEENKO CALLED ANTONOV MATHEMATICIAN AND CHESS-PLAYER
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF HESITATION A STILL EXPECTANCY AND THEN THE CROWD BEGAN TO SURGE FASTER AND FASTER STUMBLING OVER ONE ANOTHER TO THE LEFT HUNDREDS OF BIG SOLDIERS IN A SOLID MASS RUSHING ACROSS THE DIRT FLOOR IN THE FAINT LIGHT
AS I CAME INTO THE GREAT HALL TROTZKY WAS JUST FINISHING
BAWLED AT AND HISSED AT FIRST HIS SIMPLE MOVING SPEECH FINALLY MADE SILENCE
IT BEGAN
ANOTHER SOLD ILLEGAL GOLD FROM THE LENA MINES TO MYSTERIOUS PARTIES IN FINLAND
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT NONE OF THE SOLDIERS ARE FOR KERENSKY
THE RESULT IS HOWEVER THAT AT EVERY IMPORTANT NEW POINT OR VOTE THE SESSION TAKES A RECESS TO ENABLE THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND POLITICAL FACTIONS TO HOLD A CAUCUS
THIS POLICY PROVOKED A SERIES OF AGRARIAN DISORDERS WHICH APPEARED AS THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF IMPATIENCE AND THWARTED ENERGY ON THE PART OF THE PEASANTS
IN THE EVENT OF A REFUSAL BY A SUPREME COMMITTEE TO CONFIRM AN ELECTED COMMANDER WITH A STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR SUCH REFUSAL A COMMANDER ELECTED BY THE LOWER COMMITTEE A SECOND TIME MUST BE CONFIRMED
THE SITUATION AT THE FRONT DEMANDS THE MOST URGENT AND DECISIVE MEASURES
THE ISSUE OF HUNGER AND OF SURRENDERING PETROGRAD CANNOT BE DECIDED BY WAITING FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
SPECULATORS TWO ORDERS CONCERNING THEM
BECAUSE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS WANTED TO HASTEN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAND QUESTION SO THAT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO
ORDER NO
KALEDIN HAD DISPERSED ALL SOVIETS AND UNIONS IN THE DON BASIN AND HIS FORCES WERE MOVING NORTH
THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED AND EVERY ONE MUST BE READY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS
3 ANY DAMAGE WHATEVER DONE TO THE CONFISCATED PROPERTY WHICH FROM NOW ON BELONGS TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE IS REGARDED AS A SERIOUS CRIME PUNISHABLE BY THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS
AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT THE PALACE HAD FALLEN PUT ON HIS HAT AND WALKED CALMLY OUT OF THE BUILDING
IF EVERYTHING THAT IS AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI IS COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY SAID PINKEVITCH THEN I DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVOLUTION AND ANARCHY
OUR SPEAKERS ARE ARRESTED WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE LACK OF BREAD SHOUTED ANOTHER SOLDIER
THESE WERE JUST COMMON WORKMEN PEASANTS DARK PEOPLE
HE WAS THREATENED WITH LYNCHING
SOME OF MY COMRADES AND I WERE STANDING GUARD
LOOK OUT AND SEE TO IT THAT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF A KRESTNI KHOD YOUR KALEDINS DO NOT INSTIGATE YOU AGAINST WORKMEN AGAINST SOLDIERS
NOT TO HETMANS WITH THE RANK OF GENERAL BUT TO THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TOILING COSSACKS TO YOUR OWN TRUSTWORTHY RELIABLE MEN
ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE DECREE ALL LANDS HITHERTO BELONGING TO LANDLORDS NOW PASS ENTIRELY AND WHOLLY INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES
VICTORY IN THE WORDS OF CARLYLE MEANT APOTHEOSIS AND MILLENNIUM WITHOUT END SUNDAY NIGHT THE COMMISSARS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE RETURNING DESPERATELY FROM THE FIELD THE GARRISON OF PETROGRAD ELECTED ITS COMMITTEE OF FIVE ITS BATTLE STAFF THREE SOLDIERS AND TWO OFFICERS ALL CERTIFIED FREE FROM COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TAINT
THIS WAS ALL EXCELLENT FUEL FOR THE BOLSHEVIK FIRE
IT'S INSANE
THE ENEMY HAD BROUGHT UP ARMOURED TRAINS MOUNTED WITH CANNON
UPSTAIRS THE PLACE WAS ALL COMMOTION
IN JUST A FEW DAYS NOW THEIR RIDICULOUS GOVERNMENT WILL FALL AND THEN WE SHALL MAKE THEM SUFFER WE DINED AT A VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT WITH THE ENTICING NAME I EAT NOBODY AND TOLSTOY'S PICTURE PROMINENT ON THE WALLS AND THEN SALLIED OUT INTO THE STREETS
THIS DECREE ENCOURAGED THE FORMATION OF COMPANIES OF RED GUARDS ALL OVER RUSSIA WHICH BECAME THE MOST VALUABLE ARM OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT IN THE ENSUING CIVIL WAR
WORKERS SOLDIERS PEASANTS
WORKERS SOLDIERS PEASANTS
LENIN AND ZINOVIEV WENT INTO HIDING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE
THE TROUBLE IS NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT WITH THE WAR
CONSIDERING THE HOSTILE ATTITUDE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS TOWARD THE REVOLUTION EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT PROPER DISTRIBUTION OF RAW MATERIALS AND FUEL AS WELL AS THE MOST EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF FACTORIES IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT WORKERS CONTROL
STOOPED OVER THE DESK OF THE TRIBUNE LIKE THE MORTALLY SICK MAN HE WAS AND SPEAKING IN A VOICE SO HOARSE IT COULD HARDLY BE HEARD HE SHOOK HIS FINGER TOWARD THE RIGHT BENCHES
NOW THE DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HURRYING ON SPEEDING TRAINS TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF ASIA WERE COMING TO THEIR HOMES CARRYING THE FIERY CROSS
AND THE WORKER HORDES POURING OUT ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROADS QUICKENED THEIR PACE
CONTRARY TO THE WILL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MASSES ON NOVEMBER 7TH THE BOLSHEVIKI OF PETROGRAD CRIMINALLY ARRESTED PART OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT DISPERSED THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC AND PROCLAIMED AN ILLEGAL POWER
ONE SHOWED ME A REVOLVER
HE PROPOSED AGAIN THAT ALL BOLSHEVIK MEMBERS SHOULD BE EXPELLED FROM THE DUMA
THE UBIQUITOUS MURAVIOV WAS APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE WAR AGAINST THE COSSACKS AND A RED ARMY WAS RECRUITED FROM AMONG THE FACTORY WORKERS
THE ENEMY IS STILL WITH US
THE WAR WAS BRINGING THEM PROFITS POWER DISTINCTIONS
THE ORGANISERS OF THE INSURRECTION DO NOT COME TO THE AID OF THE GERMAN PROLETARIAT BUT OF THE GERMAN GOVERNING CLASSES AND THEY OPEN THE RUSSIAN FRONT TO THE IRON FISTS OF WILHELM AND HIS FRIENDS
THE OFFICERS YUNKERS AND MIDDLE CLASS GENERALLY WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT--AS WERE THE BOURGEOIS CADETS AND THE MODERATE SOCIALIST PARTIES
SOMETHING WAS IN THE AIR
REFUSED
REFUSED
THE COMMAND OF THE GARRISONS OF PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW MUST REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF DELEGATES OF THE MOSCOW AND PETROGRAD SOVIETS
THE FOUR SOCIALIST MINISTERS HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON
THEY DEPRIVE US OF OUR MEANS OF TRANSPORT BY TAKING AWAY OUR LAST MOTOR-CARS
CITIZENS SOLDIERS VALOROUS COSSACKS OF THE DON OF THE KUBAN OF THE TRANSBAIKAL OF THE AMUR OF THE YENISSEI TO ALL YOU WHO HAVE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO YOUR OATH I APPEAL
INSTEAD OF DOING THEIR DUTY THE RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE CADETS HAVE TRANSFORMED THE DUMA INTO AN ARENA OF POLITICAL ATTACK UPON THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT OF PEACE BREAD AND LIBERTY
WE MUST HAVE THE BACKING OF THE PEASANTS
HOWEVER NO HARM HAS BEEN DONE BY THAT
HE WHO MAKES IT LAST TOO LONG WILL NOT GATHER THE FRUITS AMONG THE WORKER SOLDIER AND PEASANT MASSES HOWEVER THERE WAS A STUBBORN FEELING THAT THE FIRST ACT WAS NOT YET PLAYED OUT
UNITE
WE FELL IN WITH THE FIRST RANKS
NOW PEOPLE ACCUSE KERENSKY
COMMERCIAL SHIPPING TO BE FREE
PEOPLE CAPABLE OF SPEAKING SUCH THINGS ARE FALSIFIERS PEDANTS OR SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO LOOK THE REAL SITUATION IN THE FACE
NOT WITH THE PEOPLES BUT WITH THE GOVERNMENTS 2
A SOLDIER ANNOUNCED THAT THE ALL-RUSSIAN PEASANTS SOVIETS HAD REFUSED TO SEND DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS
DELEGATES WAITED IN LINE FORTY OF THEM
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD REGIME AND THE CREATION OF THE NEW ONE
THEY ARE NOT PEASANTS AT ALL
THESE INTERESTS MEAN THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR COUNTRY REMAIN ALONE AND THAT THE PRESENT ALIGNMENT OF FORCES WITH US THE ALLIES IS SATISFACTORY
THERE WERE MANY WREATHS OF HIDEOUS ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS
THE FIRST WE MAY ATTRIBUTE TO THE LOWERING OF POLITICAL INTEREST IN THE MASSES
EVERY COMPANY REGIMENT BRIGADE DIVISION AND CORPS HAD ITS COMMITTEE OVER ALL OF WHICH WAS ELECTED THE ARMY COMMITTEE THE CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE COOPERATED WITH THE GENERAL STAFF
WE ARE AT WAR WITH GERMANY
N
BUT ALSO THE GOVERNMENT SAW THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ADOPT PRACTICAL MEASURES SO WITHOUT FURTHER REFLECTION IT ADOPTED THE REGULATIONS FOR LAND COMMITTEES THUS CREATING A STRANGE SITUATION
THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA PROPOSES TO ALL THE BELLIGERENT PEOPLES IMMEDIATELY TO CONCLUDE SUCH A PEACE BY SHOWING THEMSELVES WILLING TO ENTER UPON THE DECISIVE STEPS OF NEGOTIATIONS AIMING AT SUCH A PEACE AT ONCE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DELAY BEFORE THE DEFINITIVE RATIFICATION OF ALL THE CONDITIONS OF SUCH A PEACE BY THE AUTHORISED ASSEMBLIES OF THE PEOPLE OF ALL COUNTRIES AND OF ALL NATIONALITIES
OH KERENSKY IS GUILTY OF THE SINS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ANSWERED THE OTHER MAN
GO ON NEVER MIND THEM BUT A SAILOR OBJECTED
FIRST A TRUCE TO THE BLOODSHED SEE APP
THE RECEIPT OF MONEY ON ALL ACCOUNTS IS ALLOWED FOR ANY AMOUNT
A DECREE REGARDING THE LAND HAS ALREADY BEEN ISSUED BY THE PRESENT PROVISIONAL WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT
THE BRITISH FLEET ETC AT THE TIME OF THE NAVAL BATTLE OF THE GULF OF RIGA NOT ONLY THE BOLSHEVIKI BUT ALSO THE MINISTERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED THAT THE BRITISH FLEET HAD DELIBERATELY ABANDONED THE BALTIC AS ONE INDICATION OF THE ATTITUDE SO OFTEN EXPRESSED PUBLICLY BY THE BRITISH PRESS AND SEMI-PUBLICLY BY BRITISH REPRESENTATIVES IN RUSSIA RUSSIA'S FINISHED
THE RUSSIAN NAVAL DEFEAT IN THE GULF OF RIGA COINCIDED WITH THE PUBLIC RECEPTION BY KING GEORGE IN LONDON OF GENERAL GURKO A MAN WHOM THE RUSSIAN PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT CONSIDERED DANGEROUSLY PRO-GERMAN AS WELL AS REACTIONARY
5 THE MUNICIPAL DUMA OF PETROGRAD SHALL MEET DECEMBER 11TH 1917 AT TWO O'CLOCK
IT IS NOT FOR YOU WHO ARE LEADING THE COUNTRY TO RUIN TO THREATEN US WHO ARE DOING ALL WE CAN NOT TO ALLOW THE COUNTRY TO PERISH
ON THE EVENING OF NOVEMBER 16TH I WATCHED TWO THOUSAND RED GUARDS SWING DOWN THE ZAGORODNY PROSPEKT BEHIND A MILITARY BAND PLAYING THE MARSEILLAISE_--AND HOW APPROPRIATE IT SOUNDED--WITH BLOOD-RED FLAGS OVER THE DARK RANKS OF WORKMEN TO WELCOME HOME AGAIN THEIR BROTHERS WHO HAD DEFENDED RED PETROGRAD IN THE BITTER DUSK THEY TRAMPED MEN AND WOMEN THEIR TALL BAYONETS SWAYING
FOR THE KORNILOVS AND KALEDINS FOR THE GENERALS AND RICH MEN OR FOR THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS SOLDIERS WORKERS AND COSSACKS DEPUTIES
THIS IS THE ARGUMENT OF A SOPHOMORE WITH NO PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WHO READS THAT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS BEING CALLED AND TRUSTFULLY ACCEPTS THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL WAY
THEY CRIED THE GERMAN ARMIES WILL TRAMPLE ON OUR LIBERTY
YEDINSTVO A VERY SMALL AND DWINDLING GROUP COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF THE PERSONAL FOLLOWING OF PLEKHANOV ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE 80'S AND ITS GREATEST THEORETICIAN
THE COSSACKS ARE FALLING BACK FROM KRASNOYE SELO SHARP EXULTANT CHEERING BUT THE BATTLE IS ONLY BEGINNING
WE WENT TOWARD THE WINTER PALACE BY WAY OF THE ADMIRALTEISKY
THE SOLDIER TOOK THEM GINGERLY TURNED THEM UPSIDE DOWN AND LOOKED AT THEM WITHOUT COMPREHENSION
FROM THE TSAY-EE-KAH THE PEASANTS SOVIETS THE MODERATE SOCIALIST PARTIES THE ARMY COMMITTEES--THREATENING CURSING BESEECHING THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS TO STAY HOME TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE VALUE OF THE RUBLE FELL TO LESS THAN ONE-THIRD ITS FORMER PURCHASING POWER AND THE COST OF THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE INCREASED ENORMOUSLY
KERENSKY FLYING TO THE FRONT THROUGH COUNTRY TOWNS ALL DOUBTFULLY HEAVING UP
THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD WITHDRAWN AND WAS HOLDING A RUMP CONVENTION OF ITS OWN IN ANOTHER ROOM OF THE SAME BUILDING MADE UP OF BOLTING DELEGATES AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES
IN ALL THIS WAS EVIDENT THE HAND OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS WHO DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE REGIMENTS PLANS SHOWING THE LOCATION OF THE STORES OF LIQUOR
THE OLD REGIME MILITARY MEN BACKED BY CADETS DEMANDED THAT HARSH MEASURES BE ADOPTED TO RESTORE DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY AND THE NAVY
WE ASKED IF WE MIGHT GO INSIDE
THE BROTHERHOOD GRAVE HE EXPLAINED
IN SPITE OF LAVISH PROMISES OF HIGH WAGES AND BETTER CONDITIONS THE OPERATORS AT THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WOULD NOT CONNECT SOVIET HEADQUARTERS
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TENTH AND TWELFTH ARMIES JUST ARRIVED IN HOT HASTE REPORTED WE SUPPORT YOU WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH A PEASANT-SOLDIER PROTESTED AGAINST THE RELEASE OF THE TRAITOR SOCIALISTS MAZLOV AND SALAZKIN

BULLETIN NO
SMOLNY HAD MADE CONCESSIONS
BRING AN AXE
AS FOR THE PEASANTS AND THE SECEDING FACTIONS PLACES WERE TO BE RESERVED FOR THEM
YET UNWILLING TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE CONSERVATIVE MENSHEVIKI AND OPPOSED TO THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE WORKING-CLASS ADVOCATED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI
LET US WAIT COMRADES FOR--A MIRACLE 12
GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES REFUSING TO OBEY THEIR COMMISSARS POST AND TELEGRAPH REFUSING THEM COMMUNICATION RAILROADS ROADS STONILY IGNORING THEIR APPEALS FOR TRAINS KERENSKY COMING THE GARRISON NOT ALTOGETHER TO BE TRUSTED THE COSSACKS WAITING TO COME OUT
NOT FOR A LONG TIME IN RUSSIA WILL THE SICKNESS OF REVOLUTION HAVE RUN ITS COURSE
HALF OF THEM SIMPLE FATALISTS 5
THE DUMA CAN BE DISSOLVED AND RE-ELECTED AT THIS REPORT THERE WAS A FURIOUS OUTCRY
MY PARTY FRAMED THAT POLICY AFTER THE MOST CAREFUL COMPILATION OF THE WISHES OF THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES
WHAT SORT OF COALITION DID AVILOV MEAN
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN YOUR SURRENDERED LIFE WILL COUNT THAT TIME IS NEAR
YOU KNOW THE CADETS DO NOT REALLY WANT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY--NOT IF THE BOLSHEVIKI CAN BE DESTROYED NOW HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AT A PARTY CONGRESS HELD IN 1903 THE PARTY SPLIT ON THE QUESTION OF TACTICS INTO TWO FACTIONS--THE MAJORITY BOLSHINSTVO AND THE MINORITY MENSHINSTVO FROM THIS SPRANG THE NAMES BOLSHEVIKI AND MENSHEVIKI"--"MEMBERS OF THE MAJORITY AND MEMBERS OF THE MINORITY THESE TWO WINGS BECAME TWO SEPARATE PARTIES BOTH CALLING THEMSELVES RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY AND BOTH PROFESSING TO BE MARXIANS
THE POETS MADE VERSES--BUT NOT ABOUT THE REVOLUTION

CERTAINLY NOT
CERTAINLY NOT
TO THE LAST POSSIBILITY WE WILL REMAIN ON GUARD OF THE INTERESTS OF THE POPULATION
IF WORKMEN AND SOLDIERS SAY SO YOU DOUBT IT
EVERY CONSCIOUS WORKER REVOLUTIONIST EVERY CONSCIOUS PEASANT EVERY REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIER ALL WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT HARM A DEMONSTRATION OR A REVOLT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT CAUSE TO THE PEOPLE MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND NOT ALLOW THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE TO DESTROY OUR FREEDOM THE PETROGRAD ELECTORAL COMMITTEE OF THE MENSHEVIKI-OBORONTZI 11
HE WAS TRYING TO BRING ORDER OUT OF THE CHAOS IN WHICH AFFAIRS HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE STRIKING CLERKS
THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES AND THE TRADE UNIONS WERE THERE TO PUT INTO OPERATION WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY
AT THIS TIME TOO THE NEW GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED AS PART OF ITS POLICY THE LIQUIDATION OF IRRESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONS"--I.E
THE FORMULA OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS VERY SIMPLE
THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVING SECURED A MAJORITY IN THE SOVIET SET FREE SOME POLITICAL PRISONERS
WE THE FACTION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATS BOLSHEVIKI ANNOUNCE THAT WITH THIS GOVERNMENT OF TREASON TO THE PEOPLE WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON
THEY WERE GOING TO SHOOT ME
THEN THE LEADER OF THE MAXIMALISTS THE ANARCHIST WING OF THE PEASANTS
FOLDING THE CARBON COPY HE PUT IT IN HIS POCKET

THEY SUSPENDED ALL OTHER BUSINESS TO READ US THE LATEST BULLETINS
THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IS A GOVERNMENT OF SOVIETS
FORM SOVIETS OF COSSACKS DEPUTIES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SLOGAN PROCLAIMED BY THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY BOLSHEVIKI WORKERS CONTROL ON A NATIONAL SCALE IN ORDER TO BRING RESULTS MUST EXTEND TO ALL CAPITALIST CONCERNS AND NOT BE ORGANISED ACCIDENTALLY WITHOUT SYSTEM
IS ASSURED SEEING THAT IT IS SUSTAINED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC--IN THE GENERAL TURMOIL ATTENDING THE CONQUEST OF THE CITY THE CHIEF RAILWAY STATION HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE VICTORS
EVERYBODY MUST COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE REPORT WHERE THERE ARE STORES OF BARBED WIRE BENZINE GUNS
2 WILL THE SOLDIERS AND COSSACKS ACCEPT THE DECREES OF THE SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
THE RED GUARD OF PETROGRAD THE REVOLUTIONARY GARRISON AND THE SAILORS HAVE MAINTAINED COMPLETE ORDER IN THE CAPITAL
THE RED GUARD OF PETROGRAD THE REVOLUTIONARY GARRISON AND THE SAILORS HAVE MAINTAINED COMPLETE ORDER IN THE CAPITAL
NOT MORE THAN 150 RUBLES ARE TO BE PAID AGAINST DRAFTS
ALL THESE GOVERNMENTS AND MOVEMENTS HAD TWO CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON
KRYLENKO ENTERED MOGHILEV NEXT MORNING TO FIND A HOWLING MOB GATHERED ABOUT THE RAILWAY-CAR IN WHICH DUKHONIN HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
THERE IS ONLY ONE BOLSHEVIK OFFICER IN THIS REGIMENT
BESIDES THERE WOULD BE DELEGATES FROM THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY OLD TSAY-EE-KAH 100 MEMBERS CHOSEN BY THE MUNICIPAL DUMAS--KORNILOVTSI ALL
AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF WAS TO MOVE TO MOSCOW
THAN THE CAPITALIST CLASS
TROTZKY WENT TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
ALL COMMANDERS UP TO THE COMMANDERS OF REGIMENTS INCLUSIVE ARE ELECTED BY GENERAL SUFFRAGE OF SQUADS PLATOONS COMPANIES SQUADRONS BATTERIES DIVISIONS ARTILLERY 2-3 BATTERIES AND REGIMENTS
TEODOROVITCH POST AND TELEGRAPH N
BUT YOU HAVE ADDRESSED AN APPEAL TO THE POPULATION AND WE ARE ENTITLED ALSO TO DO SO FOLLOWED HIM SHINGARIOV CADET WHO SAID THAT THERE COULD BE NO COMMON LANGUAGE WITH THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR INDICTMENT AND WHO MUST BE TRIED ON THE CHARGE OF TREASON
WITH THE TAKING OF PETROGRAD THE BALTIC FLEET WILL ALSO BE DESTROYED
ONLY THE BARBER SHOPS WERE ALL BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND CROWDED AND A LINE FORMED AT THE DOORS OF THE PUBLIC BATH
MIR BOUDIT PEACE IS COMING
FOLLOWING HIS TACTICS OF APPEALING TO THE MASSES LENIN SENT A RADIO TO ALL REGIMENTAL DIVISIONAL AND CORPS COMMITTEES TO ALL SOLDIERS AND SAILORS OF THE ARMY AND THE FLEET ACQUAINTING THEM WITH DUKHONIN'S REFUSAL AND ORDERING THAT THE REGIMENTS ON THE FRONT SHALL ELECT DELEGATES TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ENEMY DETACHMENTS OPPOSITE THEIR POSITIONS ON THE 23D THE MILITARY ATTACHES OF THE ALLIED NATIONS ACTING ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM THEIR GOVERNMENTS PRESENTED A NOTE TO DUKHONIN IN WHICH HE WAS SOLEMNLY WARNED NOT TO VIOLATE THE CONDITIONS OF THE TREATIES CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE POWERS OF THE ENTENTE THE NOTE WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF A SEPARATE ARMISTICE WITH GERMANY WERE CONCLUDED THAT ACT WOULD RESULT IN THE MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO RUSSIA
ON THE TOP FLOOR THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WAS IN FULL BLAST STRIKING AND SLACKING NOT
THE DAILY ALLOWANCE OF BREAD FELL FROM A POUND AND A HALF TO A POUND THEN THREE QUARTERS HALF AND A QUARTER-POUND
WE CONSIDER THEIR REFUSAL INADMISSIBLE FOR REVOLUTIONISTS AND CHAMPIONS OF THE WORKING-CLASS
BUT THE SWITCH-BOARDS MUST BE OPERATED--THE TELEPHONE WAS VITAL
THE DEVIL CRIED THE RED GUARD
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER III 1
THE CROWD WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS
THE CITY WAS NERVOUS STARTING AT EVERY SHARP SOUND
IN THE MEANWHILE DELEGATIONS CONTINUED TO ARRIVE FROM PETROGRAD
THERE CAN BE AND THERE MUST BE NO RETURN TO THIS DISGRACEFUL POLICY
TO 1 P
REALISING THAT THEY CAN ONLY LAST A FEW DAYS WE HAVE DECIDED TO COME TO THE AID OF THE STRONGEST FORCE OPPOSED TO THEM--KERENSKY--AND HELP TO RESTORE ORDER THAT IS ALL VERY WELL I SAID
WHERE A SHRUG
MADAME TYRKOVA REPORTED THAT THE GIRLS HAD BEEN AT FIRST TAKEN TO THE BARRACKS OF THE PAVLOVSKY REGIMENT AND THAT THERE SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN BADLY TREATED
TO THE TOILING COSSACKS THE WAR HAS ONLY BROUGHT RUIN AND DEATH
CARGOES WHICH ARE NOT LIABLE TO REQUISITION KHALVA ARE REQUISITIONED BY THE COMMISSARS AND AS WAS THE CASE ONE DAY FIVE BOXES OF KHALVA WERE SEIZED BY THE COMMISSAR FOR HIS OWN USE
SO ENDED THE REVOLT OF THE STAVKA
I HAD A TALK WITH BURTZEV ONE DAY IN THE PRESS GALLERY OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC
TROITSKY GATE WAS BATTERED BUT EASILY REPARABLE
TO FIGHT AGAINST IT THE REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF ALL SERVICES IS INDISPENSABLE
A LOFTY WHITE ROOM LIGHTED BY GLAZED-WHITE CHANDELIERS HOLDING HUNDREDS OF ORNATE ELECTRIC BULBS AND DIVIDED BY TWO ROWS OF MASSIVE COLUMNS
THE MACHINE SLOWED DOWN AND WE CLIMBED OUT
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NAPOLEON WAS IN MOSCOW THEY SAY THE CANDLES WERE OUT
OPPOKOV LOMOV SUPPLIES E
PREMIER VINNITCHENKO HINTED AT A SEPARATE PEACE WITH GERMANY--AND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS HELPLESS
IN PROPOSING TO ALL GOVERNMENTS AND ALL PEOPLES TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE THE GOVERNMENT DECLARES ITSELF READY TO CARRY ON THESE NEGOTIATIONS BY TELEGRAPH BY POST OR BY POURPARLERS BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR AT A CONFERENCE OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES
BUT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID A CONFLICT EVEN NOW TO-DAY
4 THE NEW ELECTIONS FOR THE MUNICIPAL DUMA OF PETROGRAD ARE FIXED FOR DECEMBER 9TH 1917
DO NOT BELIEVE THE CALUMNIATORS CALLING YOU TO TAKE THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS CENTRAL BOARD OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN UNION OF EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK CENTRAL BOARD OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN TRADE UNION OF EMPLOYEES OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD CITIZENS
A FRIGHTENED PRIEST POINTED OUT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOVIET AND HURRIED ON
BLACK HUNDRED POGROMS WILL SPREAD OVER RUSSIA IF WE ALL--CONSCIOUS WORKERS SOLDIERS CITIZENS--DO NOT UNITE
ALL DAY LONG IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE CITY THERE WERE SKIRMISHES BETWEEN YUNKERS AND RED GUARDS BATTLES BETWEEN ARMOURED CARS
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO AS A MATTER OF FACT AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT THEY WERE NOT HAPPY
TRUSISHKA HAD TO OFFER HIS NOTE-BOOK
A SOLDIER WAS SPEAKING--FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-EIGHT DIVISION WHEREVER AND WHATEVER THAT WAS
TEKHINTSI THE SO-CALLED SAVAGE DIVISION IN THE ARMY MADE UP OF MOHAMETAN TRIBESMEN FROM CENTRAL ASIA AND PERSONALLY DEVOTED TO GENERAL KORNILOV
A BUNCH OF IGNORANT PEASANTS LIKE YOU HEAR SOMEBODY BAWLING A FEW CATCH-WORDS
ONLY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES CAN SAVE THEMSELVES AND THE COUNTRY
THE DUMA SAID TRUPP IS ON THE SIDE OF THE DEMOCRACY IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST ARBITRARY VIOLENCE
TERESTCHENKO WAS NEXT GLANCING SHARPLY AROUND
WHAT VERKHOVSKY REALLY SAID WAS THAT THE ALLIES MUST BE PRESSED TO OFFER PEACE BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN ARMY COULD FIGHT NO LONGER
WE REFUSE TO TRANSPORT THE TROOPS OF EITHER PARTY
WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THIS GUARD-DUTY TO PROTECT THE HOUSE AND THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO FROM ROBBERS AND MURDERERS BUT SUPPOSE THERE CAME A COMMISSAR FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TO SEARCH FOR ARMS OH THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL SAY THEY ARE
THEREFORE THE DECLARATIONS OF DIRECTORS OF GREAT DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS WHO TALK LOUDLY OF A REVOLUTIONARY CONGRESS AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER WINTER CAMPAIGN ARE DANGEROUS
EVERY NATION MUST DECIDE ITS OWN FATE
THIS PARTY EXPRESSES THE DESIRES CHIEFLY OF THE FACTORY WORKERS BUT ALSO OF A LARGE SECTION OF THE POOR PEASANTS
AS SOON AS THE NEW ORDER IS CONSOLIDATED ALL ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE PRESS WILL BE SUSPENDED
CLOSING AROUND THE MONSTER THEY THRUST THEIR BAYONETS INTO THE LOOP-HOLES AGAIN AND AGAIN YELLING
IN THE LOWER HALL WAILING AND CRIES OF GRIEF
OCCASIONALLY A PATROL TRIED TO STOP US
FOLLOWED HIM AN OFFICER DELEGATE FROM THE VITEBSK SOVIET A MENSHEVIK OBORONETZ IT ISN'T THE QUESTION OF WHO HAS THE POWER
TWO PROCLAMATIONS LENIN TO THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA COMRADES WORKERS SOLDIERS PEASANTS--ALL TOILERS
WELL WE RAN ALL THE WAY TO SMOLNY AND I GUESS WE TALKED FOR AN HOUR BEFORE THEY FINALLY SAW THAT IT WAS WAR
THE INITIATIVE OF THE NEW SOCIETY SHALL COME FROM BELOW
THE TELEPHONES WERE ALL WORKING
THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND LAND-OWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
COSSACK BROTHERS EXECUTE NO ORDERS OF THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE
PETERS LETTISH MEMBER OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CAME HURRYING ACROSS THE SQUARE
WHEN KERENSKY SAW IT HOWEVER HE SUMMONED AVKSENTIEV TO THE WINTER PALACE TO EXPLAIN
KERENSKY'S STAFF FEARING THAT THEY WOULD BE SURROUNDED GAVE THE ORDER TO RETREAT WHICH RETREAT SPEEDILY ASSUMED A DISORDERLY CHARACTER
THAT IS A LIE AND A PROVOCATION SHE SAID UNMOVED AT THE TORRENT OF ABUSE
THE LAND DECREE OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IS IDENTICAL IN ITS FUNDAMENTALS WITH THE DECISIONS OF THE FIRST PEASANTS CONGRESS
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONIST
WE CONFIRM THE DATE OF THE CONGRESS OF PEASANTS DECEMBER 13TH AT THE DUMA ALL WAS EXCITEMENT OFFICERS COMING AND GOING THE MAYOR IN CONFERENCE WITH THE LEADERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
HE HAD DESERTED HIS POST WHILE THE BATTLE WAS RAGING
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES TAKES UPON ITSELF THE GUARDING OF REVOLUTIONARY ORDER IN THE CITY AGAINST COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY AND POGROM ATTEMPTS
IF THEY SUCCEED IN PREVENTING ITS MEETING,--WELL THEN WE ARE REALISTS ENOUGH NOT TO DEPEND ON THAT UNDER DATE OF OCTOBER 29TH I FIND ENTERED IN MY NOTEBOOK THE FOLLOWING ITEMS CULLED FROM THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE DAY
WHEN WE GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS THE YUNKERS HELD US UP AND TOOK AWAY OUR GUNS
SO PLUNGED THE BOLSHEVIKI AHEAD IRRESISTIBLE OVER-RIDING HESITATION AND OPPOSITION--THE ONLY PEOPLE IN RUSSIA WHO HAD A DEFINITE PROGRAMME OF ACTION WHILE THE OTHERS TALKED FOR EIGHT LONG MONTHS
THE YUNKER ARTILLERY WAS DRAWN INTO THE WINTER PALACE
KERENSKY SPOKE TO THE ASSEMBLY APPEALING FOR AID AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO THE COSSACKS
A DUMA DELEGATE PLEADING FOR NEUTRALITY
APPEAL AGAINST INSURRECTION FROM THE CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE
A GROUND-SWELL OF REVOLT HEAVED AND CRACKED THE CRUST WHICH HAD BEEN SLOWLY HARDENING ON THE SURFACE OF REVOLUTIONARY FIRES DORMANT ALL THOSE MONTHS
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IS DIRECTING THE REPULSE OF THE CONSPIRATORS ATTACK
IS THERE A PERFORMANCE TO-NIGHT SAID THE SAILOR NERVOUSLY
BONCH-BRUEVITCH DOWN IN THE FRONT HALL KAMENIEV WAS JUST ENTERING WORN OUT BY THE ALL-NIGHT SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT BUT HAPPY
KEYS THE COLONEL SHRUGGED
IN THE NAME OF THE STRONGEST ORGANISATION IN RUSSIA I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO SPEAK AND I SAY TO YOU
THE TYRANTS THE PROVOCATORS THE GERMAN AGENTS SHOULD NEVER BE RECOGNISED
IT IS EVIDENT FINISHED KAMENIEV THAT THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL THESE RENEGADES WAS DECIDED UPON BEFOREHAND THE ASSEMBLY DECIDED TO IGNORE THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE FACTIONS AND PROCEED TO THE APPEAL TO THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS OF ALL RUSSIA
THEN AROSE A ROUGH WORKMAN HIS FACE CONVULSED WITH RAGE
MURDERERS OF THE PEOPLE BUT THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE DONE ALTHOUGH THE YUNKERS WERE TERRIFIED
12 WELL KNOWN IN THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT
ALL INVENTORIED AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY OF THE CONFISCATED LANDS MACHINERY AND LIVE-STOCK ARE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT COMPENSATION TO THE STATE OR THE COMMUNITY ACCORDING TO THEIR QUANTITY AND IMPORTANCE
A SMALL STOOPED FIGURE WITH A WRINKLED FACE EYES NEAR-SIGHTED BEHIND THICK GLASSES UNTIDY HAIR AND BEARD STREAKED WITH GREY
LAND FLOATED OVER THEM
NOW IS THE TIME FOR DEEDS NOT WORDS
THEY WOULD SURRENDER IF THEY WERE GUARANTEED PROTECTION
IN THE EVENT OF THIS NOT BEING DONE THESE PERSONS WILL BE RENDERED ANSWERABLE FOR STEALING THE TREASURY'S PROPERTY AND TRIED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COURT
KERENSKY GAVE AN ORDER TO OPEN THE BRIDGES
IF NOT ONLY PART OF IT
RYKOV AGRICULTURE V
THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF RECKLESSNESS
JUST THEN CAME A KNOCK ON THE DOOR
TAKE IMMEDIATELY ALL LOCAL POWER INTO YOUR HANDS
I WENT DOWN TO ROOM 18 ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHERE THE BOLSHEVIK DELEGATES WERE HOLDING CAUCUS A HARSH VOICE STEADILY BOOMING THE SPEAKER HIDDEN BY THE CROWD
RUSSIA IS NOT A CITY BUT A WHOLE COUNTRY
KALEDIN WAS MARCHING NORTH
LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS
THERE WERE ALWAYS THREE OR FOUR CONVENTIONS GOING ON IN PETROGRAD
AMONG THEM WE RECOGNISED MANY OF THE DELEGATES FROM THE CONGRESS LEADERS OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI APPOINTED THE 13TH OF NOVEMBER COMMISSAR OF PUBLIC WELFARE--THE DEPARTMENT OF CHARITIES AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS--WAS WELCOMED WITH A STRIKE OF ALL BUT FORTY OF THE FUNCTIONARIES IN THE MINISTRY
COMRADES AND CITIZENS HE SAID
THERE REMAIN ONLY THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA WHO HAVE SUFFERED AND ARE SUFFERING OPPRESSION AND ARBITRARINESS AND WHOSE EMANCIPATION MUST IMMEDIATELY BE BEGUN WHOSE LIBERATION MUST BE EFFECTED RESOLUTELY AND DEFINITELY
OF COURSE IF THEY ARE NOT ADMITTED THEY'LL PROBABLY DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN
THE DARK FORCES ARE INCREASINGLY TRYING TO CALL FORTH IN PETROGRAD AND OTHER TOWNS DISORDERS AND POGROMS DISORDER IS NECESSARY TO THE DARK FORCES FOR DISORDER WILL GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CRUSHING THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN BLOOD
SOLDIERS RETURN TO YOUR BARRACKS
WHY I ASKED DO YOU PUBLISH SUCH LIES IN YOUR NEWSPAPERS WITHOUT TAKING OFFENCE THE OFFICER REPLIED YES I KNOW
WHAT IS BOLSHEVISM
THIS LAW IS IN PREPARATION
NICOLAI VASILIEVITCH HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR WAS A LARGE ORNATE ROOM WITH GILDED CORNICES AND ENORMOUS CRYSTAL LUSTRES AND BEYOND IT SEVERAL SMALLER ONES WAINSCOTED WITH DARK WOOD
THE BOLSHEVIKI CAN NOT MAKE USE OF IT
AND ON OCTOBER 17TH RABOTCHI I SOLDAT ITS LEADING ARTICLE SUMMED UP THE BOLSHEVIK POINT OF VIEW
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES IT QUIETED DOWN AGAIN
BUT WE SAW THAT THE TSAR WAS NOT THE ONLY TYRANT IN THE WORLD
IN HIS BREAST WAS A HOLE
SAYS LENIN IN EXPLANATION OF THIS PHENOMENON
THE FIRST THING IS THE ADOPTION OF PRACTICAL MEASURES TO REALISE PEACE
MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES GRAPHIC PAGE 96
THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD AWAIT AN IMMEDIATE PEACE IN THE ENORMOUS AND EMPTY MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARE TO BE HEARD ONLY THE SOUND OF TWO TYPEWRITERS
MANY OF THE OLD FUNCTIONARIES FLOCKED TO ITS BANNER AND MANY MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES ENTERED THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE
THE ALLIES DON'T LIKE IT AND THE RUSSIAN DIPLOMATS DON'T LIKE IT
THE SOVIETS ARE THE MOST PERFECT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE--PERFECT IN THEIR REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE IN THEIR IDEAS AND OBJECTS
THE GOVERNMENT OF LENIN AND TROTZKY ATTACKS AND ACTS
THEY FINALLY CAME TO REPRESENT THE WEALTHIER PEASANTS THE INTELLECTUALS AND THE POLITICALLY UNEDUCATED POPULATIONS OF REMOTE RURAL DISTRICTS
THE COMMISSARS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ARE REMOVED
THE GERMAN COMRADES HAVE ONLY ONE LIEBKNECHT WITHOUT NEWSPAPERS WITHOUT FREEDOM OF MEETING WITHOUT A SOVIET
HALF A DOZEN RED GUARDS SOME SAILORS AND A SOLDIER OR TWO UNDER COMMAND OF A HUGE WORKMAN CLAMBERED IN AND SHOUTED TO ME TO COME ALONG
BUT MORE SERIOUS WERE THE STORIES OF BOLSHEVIK VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM
IN A HAND-BILL THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC RECITED ITS WRONGS
DURING CIVIL WAR THE RIGHT TO USE VIOLENCE BELONGS ONLY TO THE OPPRESSED CRIES OF WHO'S THE OPPRESSED NOW
KRYLENKO AND F
IN THAT ATTIC A YOUNG OFFICER SAT ALL DAY POURING OUT OVER THE COUNTRY A FLOOD OF APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS
THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN FROM THE ARMOURED TRAIN IN WHICH KERENSKY HIMSELF WAS RIDING SOMEBODY SAW THE AUTOMOBILE AND FIRED A CANNON
THE COMPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE'S COUNCIL WAS BEING DISCUSSED
ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 31ST APPEARED IN RABOTCHI PUT THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF LENIN'S LETTER TO THE COMRADES SEE APP
IN THE MEANWHILE NOBODY WENT HOME
A SOLDIER HELD BACK BY ONE OF THE OFFICERS WRENCHED HIMSELF LOOSE AND HELD UP HIS HAND
ONLY THE GOVERNMENT WIRELESS AT TSARSKOYE SELO LAUNCHED HALF-HOURLY BULLETINS AND MANIFESTOES TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF HEAVEN

FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH PRESERVE CLEANLINESS LONG TABLES STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS ON EVERY FLOOR AND ON THE LANDINGS HEAPED WITH PAMPHLETS AND THE LITERATURE OF THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES FOR SALE
THE KORNILOVITZ-KERENSKY KALEDIN AND OTHERS ARE ENDEAVOURING TO LEAD TROOPS AGAINST PETROGRAD
WE GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF THE REVOLUTION
AT A MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET IN SMOLNY THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 30TH TROTZKY BRANDED THE ASSERTIONS OF THE BOURGEOIS PRESS THAT THE SOVIET CONTEMPLATED ARMED INSURENTION AS AN ATTEMPT OF THE REACTIONARIES TO DISCREDIT AND WRECK THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
DAMASK AND TAPESTRY WERE SNATCHED FROM THE ARMS OF THOSE WHO HAD THEM
TO HIS PLEAS FOR PEACE TERESTCHENKO SIMPLY LAUGHED
BUT THE CITY DUMA BUILDING WAS ALL ILLUMINATED
AS FOR THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS IT SHOULD BE ARRESTED EN MASSE!_HERE WAS REAL REVOLUTIONARY TALK
THE IMPOTENCE AND INDECISION OF THE EVER-CHANGING PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS AN ARGUMENT NOBODY COULD REFUTE
MEANWHILE THE ELECTIONS FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IN PETROGRAD SEE APP
ON NOVEMBER 8TH CONSTITUTED A NEW GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC IN THE FORM OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
A PROVOCATOR
LITTLE BY LITTLE WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAJORITY OF PEASANTS WE SHALL MARCH FIRMLY AND UNHESITATINGLY TOWARD THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM WHICH WILL FORTIFY THE ADVANCE-GUARDS OF THE WORKING-CLASS OF THE MOST CIVILISED COUNTRIES AND GIVE TO THE PEOPLES AN ENDURING PEACE AND FREE THEM FROM EVERY SLAVERY AND EVERY EXPLOITATION 13
BUT A REAL DEMOCRACY CANNOT STOP AT MERE LITERACY AT UNIVERSAL ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION
FROM MOSCOW BAD NEWS
SEE NEXT PAGE THE MENSHEVIKI DELIVERED A FINAL ULTIMATUM DEMANDING THAT ALL MINISTERS AND YUNKERS BE RELEASED THAT ALL NEWSPAPERS BE ALLOWED FULL FREEDOM THAT THE RED GUARD BE DISARMED AND THE GARRISON PUT UNDER COMMAND OF THE DUMA
THE LENIN MOTION WAS CARRIED BY 34 TO 24
AH HE SAID TO BAKLANOV
ARE ALMOST CERTAIN
AND SO WHILE THE OBORONTSI MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN COMPROMISE WITH THE BOURGEOISIE THE BOLSHEVIKI RAPIDLY CAPTURED THE RUSSIAN MASSES
MOST OF THE MIKHAILOV YUNKERS WERE FIGHTING IN THE STREETS
COMMITS A SERIOUS CRIME AGAINST THE REVOLUTION AND WILL BE PUNISHED WITH ALL THE RIGOUR OF REVOLUTIONARY LAW
TO SURRENDER THE POWER
WE LEFT THE TSAY-EE-KAH BECAUSE OF THE UNCOMPROMISING POLICY OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND TO FORCE THEM TO MAKE CONCESSIONS IN ORDER TO REALISE THE UNION OF ALL THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY
MANDELBAUM ABOUT HALF THE LOOT WAS RECOVERED SOME OF IT IN THE BAGGAGE OF FOREIGNERS LEAVING RUSSIA
FROM PASSIVE LOYALTY TO THE REVOLUTION THE COSSACKS HAVE PASSED TO AN ACTIVE POLITICAL OFFENSIVE AGAINST IT FROM THE BACK-GROUND OF THE REVOLUTION THEY HAVE SUDDENLY ADVANCED TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TSAR THE PROPRIETORS AND THE CAPITALISTS AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT OF COALITION AND CONCILIATION FAILED TO REALISE THE DESIRES OF THE WORKERS WITH REGARD TO SOCIAL INSURANCE
DUSK FELL AND STILL THE BANNERS CAME DROOPING AND FLUTTERING THE BAND PLAYED THE FUNERAL MARCH AND THE HUGE ASSEMBLAGE CHANTED
THEY WANT TO FORCE YOU INTO BATTLE WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OF THE CAPITAL
THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTING A GOVERNMENT OF SOCIALIST COALITION CAN ALONE ACCOMPLISH THE REVOLUTION
THE NEXT DAY IN SPITE OF THE BITTER OPPOSITION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI THE RESOLUTION WAS AMENDED TO GIVE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHETHER ELECTED AS DELEGATES OR NOT VOICE AND VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY
THROUGH THE WINDOW WE COULD SEE IN THE SWIFTLY-DEEPENING DARKNESS MASSES OF SOLDIERS GOING ALONG THE MUDDY ROAD TOWARD THE CITY FLINGING OUT THEIR ARMS IN ARGUMENT
NOT BEING ABLE TO REMAIN AT MY POST WHERE I HAD NO INFLUENCE I RESIGNED
BECAUSE THE FIRING ON THE WINTER PALACE DOESN'T CEASE THE MUNICIPAL DUMA TOGETHER WITH THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIET HAS DECIDED TO PERISH WITH THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE GOING WITH THEM
INSULT
WHERE TO BUT WHEN WE SAID SMOLNY THE IZVOSHTCHIK SHOOK HIS HEAD
I AM STABS--CAPITAN VLADIMIR ARTZIBASHEV ABSOLUTELY AT YOUR SERVICE IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN FOUR STRANGERS ONE A WOMAN WANDERING THROUGH THE DEFENCES OF AN ARMY AWAITING ATTACK
THESE PEOPLE ARE FOREIGN COMRADES--FROM AMERICA
A MILITARY BAND CAME MARCHING UP PLAYING THE INTERNATIONALE AND SPONTANEOUSLY THE SONG CAUGHT AND SPREAD LIKE WIND-RIPPLES ON A SEA SLOW AND SOLEMN
EVERYTHING THAT WAS PLAINLY NOT HIS PROPERTY WAS TAKEN AWAY THE MAN AT THE TABLE NOTED IT ON HIS PAPER AND IT WAS CARRIED INTO A LITTLE ROOM
ALL CULPRITS AGAINST THIS ORDER WILL BE TRIED BY A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COURT
AND AT THE SAME TIME INVITES THE PEASANTS TO APPOINT TO POSTS AND POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY ONLY PERSONS WHO HAVE PROVED NOT BY WORDS BUT BY ACTS THEIR ENTIRE DEVOTION TO THE INTERESTS OF THE EXPLOITED PEASANT-WORKERS THEIR DESIRE AND THEIR ABILITY TO DEFEND THESE INTERESTS AGAINST ALL RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF THE GREAT LAND-OWNERS THE CAPITALISTS THEIR PARTISANS AND ACCOMPLICES
WHAT A MARVELLOUS SIGHT TO SEE PUTILOVSKY ZAVOD THE PUTILOV FACTORY POUR OUT ITS FORTY THOUSAND TO LISTEN TO SOCIAL DEMOCRATS SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ANARCHISTS ANYBODY WHATEVER THEY HAD TO SAY AS LONG AS THEY WOULD TALK
WE MUST REMAIN CALM AND NOT ACT UNTIL PUBLIC OPINION IS FIRMLY GROUPED IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION--THEN WE CAN PASS FROM THE DEFENSIVE TO ACTION THE VIKZHEL REPRESENTATIVE ANNOUNCED THAT HIS ORGANISATION WAS TAKING THE INITIATIVE IN FORMING THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND ITS DELEGATES WERE NOW DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH SMOLNY
LUNATCHARSKY'S DECLARATION COMRADES
ZRA'ZVUITYE COMRADES HE GREETED WHILE BEHIND HIM ONE CANNON TWENTY RIFLES AND A TRUCK-LOAD OF GRUBIT BOMBS HUNG BY A HAIR
DURING THE WAR THE ZEMSTVOS GRADUALLY TOOK OVER THE ENTIRE FEEDING AND CLOTHING OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY AS WELL AS THE BUYING FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WORK AMONG THE SOLDIERS GENERALLY CORRESPONDING TO THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN Y
I MYSELF AM YOU MIGHT SAY A CADET BUT HOW I BEGAN BEWILDERED
FOODSTUFFS AND FUEL WERE HOARDED OR SECRETLY SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO SWEDEN
ON ONE SIDE ARE KERENSKY KALEDIN KORNILOV THE MENSHEVIKI SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES CADETS DUMAS OFFICERS
BOTH OBSERVATIONS WERE CORRECT
PIGS SHRILLED THE GIRLS INDIGNANTLY PUTTING ON THEIR COATS AND HATS
THERE MUST BE NO OPPRESSING OF ONE NATION BY ANOTHER
THE KORNILOV AFFAIR DREW TOGETHER ALL THE SOCIALIST GROUPS--"MODERATES AS WELL AS REVOLUTIONISTS--IN A PASSIONATE IMPULSE OF SELF-DEFENCE
WELL MY FRIEND DO YOU KNOW THAT LENIN WAS SENT THROUGH GERMANY IN A CLOSED CAR
THEIR RATIONS WERE DIMINISHED THEIR PAY WAS CUT OFF AND THE ROADS TOWARD THE VILLAGE OF COURTINE WERE GUARDED BY FRENCH SOLDIERS
AS NIGHT FELL THE GREAT HALL FILLED WITH SOLDIERS AND WORKMEN A MONSTROUS DUN MASS DEEP-HUMMING IN A BLUE HAZE OF SMOKE
IN A WEEK THE BOLSHEVIK GOVERNMENT WILL GO TO PIECES
IN THIS WERE AGREED ALL THE LEFT WING PARTIES
LONG LIVE THE UNION OF THE COSSACKS THE SOLDIERS PEASANTS AND WORKERS
WE MUST NOT LOSE TIME COMRADES
WHEN IT FINISHED HE SAID SIMPLY WE SHALL NOW PROCEED TO CONSTRUCT THE SOCIALIST ORDER AGAIN THAT OVERWHELMING HUMAN ROAR
IT IS STILL FASHIONABLE AFTER A WHOLE YEAR OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT TO SPEAK OF THE BOLSHEVIK INSURRECTION AS AN ADVENTURE ADVENTURE IT WAS AND ONE OF THE MOST MARVELLOUS MANKIND EVER EMBARKED UPON SWEEPING INTO HISTORY AT THE HEAD OF THE TOILING MASSES AND STAKING EVERYTHING ON THEIR VAST AND SIMPLE DESIRES
IT IS DECISIVE FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI
OTHERWISE WE SHALL CALL A STRIKE TO-MORROW NIGHT
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OBJECTED TO SKOBELIEV AND HIS NAKAZ THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS PROTESTED AND FINALLY BONAR LAW IN THE BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION RESPONDED COLDLY AS FAR AS I KNOW THE PARIS CONFERENCE WILL NOT DISCUSS THE AIMS OF THE WAR AT ALL BUT ONLY THE METHODS OF CONDUCTING IT AT THIS THE CONSERVATIVE RUSSIAN PRESS WAS JUBILANT AND THE BOLSHEVIKI CRIED SEE WHERE THE COMPROMISING TACTICS OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAVE LED THEM ALONG A THOUSAND MILES OF FRONT THE MILLIONS OF MEN IN RUSSIA'S ARMIES STIRRED LIKE THE SEA RISING POURING INTO THE CAPITAL THEIR HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF DELEGATIONS CRYING PEACE
CARRIED ALONG BY THE EAGER WAVE OF MEN WE WERE SWEPT INTO THE RIGHT HAND ENTRANCE OPENING INTO A GREAT BARE VAULTED ROOM THE CELLAR OF THE EAST WING FROM WHICH ISSUED A MAZE OF CORRIDORS AND STAIR-CASES
THE GENERAL HAVING ALSO COME TO LIFE WE INVESTIGATED AND COULD FIND NO TRACE OF ANY BODY FOUND WHATEVER
HE WENT OUT WITH THE RED CROSS AUTOMOBILE WHICH WAS OSTENSIBLY FULL OF WOUNDED
THE WORLD THINKS THAT THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION IS AT AN END
THE TELEPHONE STATION WAS BESIEGED BY SAILORS WHO LAY BEHIND BARRICADES OF BARRELS BOXES AND TIN SHEETS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORSKAYA OR SHELTERED THEMSELVES AT THE CORNER OF THE GOROKHOVAYA AND OF ST ISAAC'S SQUARE SHOOTING AT ANYTHING THAT MOVED
THE CONSPIRATORS WHO HAVE NO SUPPORT AMONG THE GARRISON OR THE WORKING-CLASS ABOVE ALL COUNTED ON THE SUDDENNESS OF THEIR ATTACK
TO THE LAST WARNING OF THE USURPERS OF THE POWER WE REPLY
IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR OF LABOUR ALEXANDER SHLIAPNIKOV
SLEEP CITIZENS ONLY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE STILL FUNCTIONED UNSLEEPING
AT THE MOMENT OF THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE THE PRESSURE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WILL BE IN THE DIRECTION OF NO ANNEXATIONS NO INDEMNITIES THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES AND A FEDERATED REPUBLIC OF EUROPE
SECOND WAR AND PEACE
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROVOKE US
WAS IT AN AMBUSH
THERE WAS MILK FOR ABOUT HALF THE BABIES IN THE CITY
THEY MUST RETURN AND SUBMIT TO THE DECISIONS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ONLY IN THE PETROGRAD GARRISON WAS THERE STILL UNCERTAINTY
OLD RUSSIA WAS NO MORE
A FAITHFULLY AND HONESTLY ELECTED CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
12
12
BUT THE READER MUST REALIZE THAT WHAT TOOK PLACE IN PETROGRAD WAS ALMOST EXACTLY DUPLICATED WITH GREATER OR LESSER INTENSITY AT DIFFERENT INTERVALS OF TIME ALL OVER RUSSIA
I TOLD THE MAYOR THIS MORNING THAT THE DUMA WOULD BE LEFT ALONE OUT ON THE NEVSKY IN THE DEEPENING DUSK A LONG DOUBLE FILE OF CYCLISTS CAME RIDING GUNS SLUNG ON THEIR SHOULDERS
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HAS DECLARED TO ALL GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES
IT WAS BITTER COLD
HE SHOWED ME TWO PROCLAMATIONS ONE SIGNED BY GOTZ AND POLKOVNIKOV ORDERING THE YUNKER SCHOOLS SOLDIER CONVALESCENTS IN THE HOSPITALS AND THE KNIGHTS OF ST GEORGE TO MOBILISE ON A WAR FOOTING AND WAIT FOR ORDERS FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
MEASURES OF POLITICAL REPRESSION CAN ONLY BE EMPLOYED SUBJECT TO DECISION OF A SPECIAL TRIBUNAL ELECTED BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH PROPORTIONALLY TO THE STRENGTH OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES REPRESENTED
NEXT DAY THE TSAY-EE-KAH SUMMONED ITS OWN MEETING COMPOSED LARGELY OF OFFICERS FORMED A COMMITTEE TO COOPERATE WITH THE STAFF AND DETAILED COMMISSARS IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE CITY
THE SOVIET FORCES MOSTLY RAW RED GUARDS WERE WITHOUT OFFICERS AND WITHOUT A DEFINITE PLAN
THE PRESENT ORDER MUST BE IMMEDIATELY READ TO ALL MILITARY UNITS OF EVERY BRANCH OF THE SERVICE
ALL POWER TO THE DIRECT REPRESENTATIVES OF MILLIONS ON MILLIONS OF COMMON WORKERS SOLDIERS PEASANTS
PETROGRAD WOKE TO BURSTS OF RIFLE-FIRE AND THE TRAMPING THUNDER OF MEN MARCHING
THE SOLDIERS SCRAMBLED TO THEIR FEET
TO ESTABLISH A UNITED POWER WE MUST AGAIN RESTORE THE PRESTIGE OF THE REVOLUTION
THEN TWO MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS DECLARING THAT THE APPEAL OF THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS WAS A DIRECT INCITEMENT TO MASSACRE
AND IF NECESSARY WE WILL SHOOT YOU TOO
WHAT SHALL WE DO ASKED ANTONOV
BUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS NOW AROUSED
A SOLDIER ACCOMPANIED BY A SMALL BOY WITH A PAIL OF PASTE WAS STICKING UP GREAT FLARING NOTICES
WE CANNOT ADMIT EITHER A REPUBLIC OR THE PRESENT REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
THE REVOLTING PEOPLE HAVE ARRESTED KERENSKY'S MINISTERS AND YOU HAVE SEEN HOW THE ORDER AND SUPPLYING OF PETROGRAD AT ONCE IMPROVED
APPARENTLY THE GREATEST CONFUSION PREVAILED ALONG THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT
A TALL IMPECCABLY-DRESSED YOUNG MAN WITH A SMOOTH FACE AND HIGH CHEEK-BONES SUAVELY READING HIS CAREFUL NON-COMMITTAL SPEECH
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES CALLS UPON THE WORKERS AND THE PEASANTS OF RUSSIA TO SUPPORT WITH ALL THEIR ENERGY AND ALL THEIR DEVOTION THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION
FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF ANTONOV CHIEF OF STAFF VLAD
SO THE TSAY-EE-KAH INVITED THE POPULAR ORGANISATIONS TO SEND DELEGATES TO A DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE WHICH SHOULD MEET AT PETROGRAD IN SEPTEMBER
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME COMRADE
ONLY THREE WEEKS LATER DID THEY FINALLY SUBMIT
THE DEPUTATION RETURNED SEVERAL HOURS LATER CONVINCED OF THE FUTILITY OF THE NEGOTIATIONS
THE LOOTING WAS JUST BEGINNING WHEN SOMEBODY CRIED COMRADES
IMMEDIATELY THE CROWD BEGAN TO RUN AS PETROGRAD CROWDS DO FALLING DOWN AND LYING STILL IN THE STREET PILED IN THE GUTTERS HEAPED UP BEHIND TELEPHONE-POLES
4 IN THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE SIMILAR INCIDENTS OCCURRED
OCCASIONALLY THROUGH THE HALF-DRAWN PORTIERES WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A DOOR OPENING INTO A BATH-ROOM WHERE A HEAVILY-BUILT OFFICER IN A COLONEL'S UNIFORM SAT ON THE TOILET WRITING SOMETHING ON A PAD HELD IN HIS LAP
3 ALL MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES SHALL CONTINUE TO FULFIL THEIR DUTIES
THEN IT BEGAN TO MOVE LIKE AN AVALANCHE BEARING DOWN UPON US GREAT BLACK-BROWED MEN FORCING THEIR WAY THROUGH
THE LITTLE MAN DIDN'T SEEM TO HEAR IT
AMONG THEM THERE WAS HOWEVER A WIDER DIFFERENCE OF SHADES OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC OPINION THAN AMONG THE MENSHEVIKI
THE POMIESHTCHIKI OF COURSE OPPOSE THE PEASANTS AND THE MANUFACTURES OPPOSE THE WORKERS
ONE HAD ONLY TO LISTEN TO THE SPEECH OF THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO BE CONVINCED THAT IN THIS HALL THE INFLUENCE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY ON FOREIGN POLICY IS SO STRONG THAT THE MINISTER DOES NOT DARE TO SPEAK FACE TO FACE WITH IT ABOUT THE HONOUR AND DIGNITY OF RUSSIA
THE CITY OF PETROGRAD IS DECLARED TO BE IN A STATE OF SIEGE
TO EXPRESS SEVERE CENSURE OF ALL PARTIES WHICH UNDER COVER OF AN AGREEMENT WISH PRACTICALLY TO ANNUL THE POPULAR CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER
THE DUMA BURNED TO THE GROUND
A FEVERISH LITTLE SHEET OF FOUR PAGES RUNNING TO ENORMOUS TYPE CONTAINING NO NEWS
TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE
TO MEET THEM TO LEND THEM SUPPORT TO CLEAR THE ROAD BEFORE THEM IS THE FIRST TASK OF A REVOLUTIONARY AND POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF DEMOCRATIC EDUCATION
WE HAVE THROWN OFF THE YOKE OF CAPITALISM JUST AS THE FIRST REVOLUTION THREW OFF THE YOKE OF TSARISM
IF YOU PLAY FOR HIGH STAKES YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO TAKE A CHANCE YES
EITHER--THE POWER WILL REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE BOURGEOIS-LANDLORD CREW AND THIS WILL MEAN EVERY KIND OF REPRESSION FOR THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS CONTINUATION OF THE WAR INEVITABLE HUNGER AND DEATH
THE COMBINATION OF FORCES WHICH UNITES US TO THE ALLIES IS FAVOURABLE TO THE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT OUR VIEWS ON THE QUESTIONS OF WAR AND PEACE SHALL BE IN ACCORD WITH THE VIEWS OF THE ALLIES AS CLEARLY AND PRECISELY AS POSSIBLE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE COMMISSARS REPORTED--CAPTURE OF THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE STREET-FIGHTING THE TAKING OF THE VLADIMIR SCHOOL
WE HAVE JUSTICE ON OUR SIDE
THE FOLLOWING CLASSES OF NEWSPAPERS SHALL BE SUBJECT TO CLOSURE
TO AMERICANS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE CLASS WAR SHOULD DEVELOP TO SUCH A PITCH
THE STRIKE OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WAS WELL ORGANISED FINANCED BY THE BANKS AND COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS
BUT I CAN BEAR NO MORE
AND AT 10 A
A STRANGE POPULAR LEADER--A LEADER PURELY BY VIRTUE OF INTELLECT
WE MOUNTED TO THE GALLERIED ALEXANDER HALL HUNG WITH ITS GREAT GOLD-FRAMED RED-SHROUDED IMPERIAL PORTRAITS
WE'RE MOVING SEE APP
HE WAS A REAL SPECIMEN OF THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTZIA
AMONG THE MINORITY WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI RIAZANOV AND LOZOVSKY WHO DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO VOTE AGAINST ANY RESTRICTION ON THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
AND I TELL YOU THAT THIS ISN'T SOCIALISM YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR
THIS ORDER SHALL BE READ IN ALL REGIMENTS BATTALIONS AND SQUADRONS
A FEW DAYS LATER WAS ISSUED DETAILED REGULATIONS FOR THE VOLOST TOWNSHIP LAND COMMITTEES FOLLOWED BY LENIN'S INSTRUCTION TO PEASANTS SEE APP
ALL PARTIES ARE TO BIND THEMSELVES NOT TO CONCLUDE ANY SECRET TREATIES
HOTEL AFTER HOTEL ALL FULL OR THE PROPRIETORS STILL SO FRIGHTENED THAT ALL THEY COULD SAY WAS NO NO THERE IS NO ROOM
IN THE NAME OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT I ORDER ALL REGIMENTS TO TAKE THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY AND TO TAKE ALL MEASURES TO ARREST KERENSKY AND ALSO TO OPPOSE ANY ADVENTURE WHICH MIGHT MENACE THE CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE VICTORY OF THE PROLETARIAT
WE SET OUT DOWN THE TVERSKAYA THE BANNERS FLAPPING OVERHEAD
THE COBBLESTONES OF THE TVERSKAYA AND NIKITSKAYA HAD BEEN TORN UP FOR TRENCHES AND BARRICADES
IN SOME PLACES THE PEOPLE PREVENTED FROM ELECTING THEIR REGULAR SOVIET DELEGATES HELD RUMP MEETINGS AND CHOSE ONE OF THEIR NUMBER TO GO TO PETROGRAD
THAT IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT REPLIED TO THE TRENCHES ABOUT PEACE
THE RESULT OF SUCH A POLICY ARE KNOWN
TO THIS END THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS RESOLVES
NOW THEY WERE AWED BY THE CRUSHING OF THE YUNKER REBELLION
THE BROKEN REACTION MUST BE FINALLY CRUSHED A FULL TRIUMPH MUST BE SECURED TO OUR ENDEAVOURS
WE SHOWED OUR PASSES
ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS--THAT MEANS DEATH
I AM COMMISSAR OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THE TORPEDOING OF COMMERCIAL SHIPS TO BE FORBIDDEN
THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION SUMMONS YOU CITIZENS TO REFUSE TO RECOGNISE THE POWER OF VIOLENCE
INSTEAD OF RECOGNISING THAT THE SALVATION OF THE COUNTRY LIES IN CONCLUDING PEACE INSTEAD OF THROWING OPENLY THE IDEA OF IMMEDIATE PEACE TO ALL THE WORN-OUT PEOPLES OVER THE HEADS OF DIPLOMATS AND IMPERIALISTS AND MAKING THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR IMPOSSIBLE,--THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT BY ORDER OF THE CADETS THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS AND THE ALLIED IMPERIALISTS WITHOUT SENSE WITHOUT PURPOSE AND WITHOUT A PLAN CONTINUES TO DRAG ON THE MURDEROUS WAR SENTENCING TO USELESS DEATH NEW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND PREPARING TO GIVE UP PETROGRAD AND TO WRECK THE REVOLUTION
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET IS OUR GOVERNMENT
COULD I GO WITH YOU BAKLANOV CONSIDERED
PAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS EXCEEDING 150 RUBLES A WEEK ON CURRENT ACCOUNTS AND SAVINGS BANKS BOOKS ALSO PAYMENTS ON OTHER ACCOUNTS OF ALL KINDS WILL BE ALLOWED DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS--NOVEMBER 22ND 23D AND 24TH ONLY IN THE FOLLOWING CASES
POPULIST SOCIALISTS SUPPORT
THE SOVIET TROOPS IN CONTACT WITH HIS COSSACKS WERE SAID TO BE GOING OVER TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
DAN PROPOSED THAT AN ULTIMATUM BE SENT DEMANDING THE ABOLITION OF THESE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS OR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE WOULD IMMEDIATELY BREAK OFF ALL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
AND NOW IT WAS FIXED FOR NOVEMBER 10TH
RIGHT AWAY IN ONE CORNER SAT A MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A CAPTAIN ADDRESSING THE ASSEMBLY WHICH INTERRUPTED HIM AT EVERY FEW WORDS
OH I'AM JUST LOOKING ON
THE COLLECTIVE WAGE AGREEMENTS ARRANGED BY THE TRADE UNIONS FOR THE MAJORITY OF WORKERS IN ANY BRANCH OF LABOUR MUST BE BINDING ON ALL THE OWNERS OF PLANTS EMPLOYING THIS KIND OF LABOUR IN THE GIVEN DISTRICT
IZVIESTIA AND DIELO NARODA_--YOUR OWN PAPER--THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM TCHERNOV'S WIDE FACE WITH THE SMALL EYES WAVING HAIR AND GREYISH BEARD BECAME RED WITH WRATH BUT HE CONTROLLED HIMSELF AND WENT ON
THE MASSIVE FACADE OF SMOLNY BLAZED WITH LIGHTS AS WE DROVE UP AND FROM EVERY STREET CONVERGED UPON IT STREAMS OF HURRYING SHAPES DIM IN THE GLOOM
ON YOU DEPENDS NOW WHETHER YOUR BROTHERS BLOOD IS TO FLOW STILL
BUT WHY SHOULD WE RISK EVERYTHING BY MAKING AN ATTEMPT OURSELVES
I WILL GIVE YOU MY ADDRESS IN SPITE OF OUR PROTESTATIONS HE WROTE IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND SEEMED TO FEEL BETTER AT ONCE
AS LONG AGO AS MAY 1917 THE PETROGRAD SOVIET THEN UNDER CONTROL OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAD PROCLAIMED THE FAMOUS RUSSIAN PEACE-CONDITIONS
ORLOV WAS HATED BY THE MINERS
THE PEASANTS SOVIETS REMAINED STILL CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE IN THE SLUGGISH RURAL DISTRICTS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS DEVELOPED SLOWLY AND THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY HAD BEEN FOR A GENERATION THE PARTY WHICH HAD AGITATED AMONG THE PEASANTS
RUSSIA ABSORBED READING MATTER LIKE HOT SAND DRINKS WATER INSATIABLE
NOW THROUGH THE GATE WAS FLOWING AN ENDLESS STREAM OF BANNERS ALL SHADES OF RED WITH SILVER AND GOLD LETTERING KNOTS OF CREPE HANGING FROM THE TOP--AND SOME ANARCHIST FLAGS BLACK WITH WHITE LETTERS
TO PROPOSE TO THE ENEMY MILITARY AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY TO CEASE HOSTILITIES AND ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE
FOR TRANSLATION SEE APPENDIX 3
THE BEARER OF THIS PASS JOHN REED IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY AN INTERNATIONALIST
TSARSKOYE SELO STATION WAS QUIET BUT KNOTS OF SOLDIERS STOOD HERE AND THERE TALKING IN LOW TONES AND LOOKING UNEASILY DOWN THE EMPTY TRACK IN THE DIRECTION OF GATCHINA
THE REPULSE OF KERENSKY IS THE REPULSE OF THE LAND-OWNERS THE BOURGEOISIE AND THE KORNILOVISTS IN GENERAL
OPINIONS WERE VERY MUCH DIVIDED UPON THIS THE RIGHT WING MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AS WELL AS THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS THE COOPERATIVES AND THE BOURGEOIS ELEMENTS BEING BITTERLY AGAINST
AND THESE FOUR HALF-RUNNING DOWN THE HALL FROM THE OFFICE OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND SCRIBBLING ON BITS OF PAPER AS THEY RUN--THESE WERE COMMISSARS DESPATCHED TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF RUSSIA TO CARRY THE NEWS ARGUE OR FIGHT--WITH WHATEVER ARGUMENTS OR WEAPONS CAME TO HAND
EARLY IN THE MORNING I WENT OUT TO SMOLNY
COSSACKS WERE SENT TO RESTORE ORDER AMONG THE PEASANTS TO BREAK THE STRIKES
ONE MAN TORE THE WRAPPING FROM A BUNDLE AND BEGAN TO HURL HANDFULS OF PAPERS INTO THE AIR
THE FALL OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
AT PRESENT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OBSTRUCTS THE ACTION OF THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC WILL JUST AS THE TSAR'S GOVERNMENT DID
UPON HIS ARRIVAL TCHERNOV WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO SMOLNY WHERE AFTER A SHORT CONVERSATION HE WAS RELEASED
SEVERAL OF THE OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE RED GUARDS GRUMBLED PROTESTS AND THE SAILOR REMARKED TRIUMPHANTLY VOT THERE
ON OCTOBER 29TH I WENT TO THE WHITE-MARBLE AND CRIMSON HALL OF THE MARINSKY PALACE WHERE THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC SAT TO HEAR TERESTCHENKO'S DECLARATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S FOREIGN POLICY AWAITED WITH SUCH TERRIBLE ANXIETY BY ALL THE PEACE-THIRSTY AND EXHAUSTED LAND
BY VIRTUE OF THE PRESENT THE CITY OF PETROGRAD AND ITS SUBURBS ARE DECLARED IN A STATE OF SIEGE
THE FACES OF THESE WOMEN WERE ROUGHENED AND SCARRED WITH LIFE AT ITS MOST DIFFICULT
ONE GAMBLED IN FOODSTUFFS
PERSONS EQUIPPED WITH SPECIAL AUTHORITY WILL OPERATE THESE ARRESTS
IN THIS WORK THE CRONSTADT SAILORS FLOWER AND PRIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES AS TROTZKY CALLED THEM ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH IRON SELF-DICIPLINE
RUTENBURG CAME IN FOR LESS
I HAVE LISTENED IN THE BREAD-LINES HEARING THE BITTER ACRID NOTE OF DISCONTENT WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME BURST UP THROUGH THE MIRACULOUS GOODNATURE OF THE RUSSIAN CROWD
THE BANKING BUSINESS IS DECLARED A STATE MONOPOLY
AS TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IT ADHERED STRICTLY TO THE FORMULA OF MAY NO ANNEXATIONS AND NO PUNITIVE INDEMNITIES WE CONSIDER IT ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY TO PROCLAIM THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES BUT ALSO TO RENOUNCE IMPERIALIST AIMS GERMANY IS CONTINUALLY TRYING TO MAKE PEACE
GENERAL ZANKIEVITCH HAVING DISCOVERED THAT A RUSSIAN ARTILLERY BRIGADE WAS PASSING THROUGH FRANCE DECIDED TO FORM A MIXED DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY TO REDUCE THE REBELS
I HAVE ORDERS FROM THE COMMITTEE NOT TO LET ANYBODY GO TO THE WINTER PALACE HE GRUMBLED
IF THE STAFF WITH KERENSKY AT ITS HEAD WANTS TO GIVE UP PETROGRAD IT CAN DO IT DOUBLY OR TREBLY
WOE TO THE PEOPLE IF THESE HOPES ARE REALISED
THE CHAUFFEUR VIOLENTLY PROTESTED
PETROGRAD 6TH OF DECEMBER 3 O'CLOCK IN THE NIGHT
THIS IS WRONG COMRADES
THE ACCUSATION THAT I HELPED LEAD AN ARMY ON PETROGRAD HAS NO FOUNDATION AND IS ENTIRELY FALSE
LETTISH SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SUPPORT
BUT SOON THEY BEGAN TO BOAST
WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM ONE OF MY GUARDS HELD OUT THE PASS
ALL WE CAN BE SURE OF IS THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY DETERMINATION OF THE PEASANTS IS NOW AROUSED AND THAT THE CONSTITUENT WILL BE FORCED TO SETTLE THE LAND QUESTION THE WAY THE PEASANTS WANT IT SETTLED
LAND TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE LAND COMMITTEES
FAREWELL BROTHERS YOU CHOSE A NOBLE PATH AT YOUR GRAVE WE SWEAR TO FIGHT TO WORK FOR FREEDOM AND THE PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS
AROUND DIMLY SQUATTED THE MONSTROUS SHAPES OF THE ARMOURED CARS
ALSO TO PASS AND OCCUPY PAVLOVSKOYE FORTIFYING ITS SOUTHERN SIDE AND TO TAKE UP THE RAILROAD AS FAR AS DNO
TWO WEEKS LATER GENERAL KALEDIN RECEIVED A DEPUTATION FROM HIS TROOPS
HIM THEY LISTENED TO WITH SHINING EYES
POLISH SOCIALISTS SUPPORT--BUT WOULD PREFER A SOCIALIST COALITION
HOW THE ANONYMOUS HORDES OF THE PEOPLE GATHERING IN THE DARKNESS AROUND THE BATTLE ROSE LIKE A TIDE AND POURED OVER THE ENEMY
WE ARE WILLING AT ANY TIME TO INCLUDE THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES IN THE GOVERNMENT
YOU ARE TOLD THAT THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES ARE YOUR ENEMIES THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR COSSACK LAND YOUR COSSACK LIBERTY DON'T BELIEVE IT COSSACKS
BEFORE IT COULD BE STOPPED FIVE YUNKERS WERE BEATEN AND STABBED TO DEATH
IT ALONE CAN PERMANENTLY ESTABLISH THE ORDER OF NATIONAL AND SOCIAL LIFE IN OUR COUNTRY AND AT THE SAME TIME THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE ORGANISATION OF POPULAR EDUCATION
4 NO MERCY TO THE SELLERS OF LIQUOR THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SENT FOR THE DELEGATION FROM THE VIBORG SECTION
DOWN WITH THE TRAITOR THE WHOLE PLACE SEETHED AND ROARED
THEY ARE THREATENING TO LYNCH THE MINISTERS THERE WAS A WHIRLWIND OF INDIGNATION AND HORROR WHICH ONLY GREW MORE VIOLENT WHEN A STOCKY LITTLE WOMAN DRESSED IN GREY DEMANDED THE FLOOR AND LIFTED UP HER HARD METALLIC VOICE
SAID ONE PROCLAMATION YOU ARE BEING LED AGAINST PETROGRAD
EVERY LITTLE WHILE HE WOULD PAUSE PICK UP THE REVOLVER AND LOVINGLY SPIN THE CHAMBER
WHAT ABOUT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE BRITISH FLEET
PROBABLY THE IMPERIALIST GOVERNMENTS WILL NOT ANSWER OUR APPEAL--BUT WE SHALL NOT ISSUE AN ULTIMATUM TO WHICH IT WILL BE EASY TO SAY NO
MOST OF THE BATTLESHIPS ARE COMPLETELY DEMORALISED
THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE FIGHTING DESCRIBED TO ME HOW THE SAILORS FOUGHT UNTIL THEY RAN OUT OF CARTRIDGES AND THEN STORMED
9 THE GERMAN COLONIES TO BE RETURNED
THESE ESSENTIALS MUST BECOME THE PROPERTY OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND BE APPORTIONED FIRST OF ALL TO THE SOCIALIST PARTIES IN STRICT PROPORTION TO THEIR VOTING STRENGTH THEN THE VOTE
IT CAN SABOTAGE THE ARMY'S FOOD SUPPLY
ACTED AS A VULGAR POLICEMAN AGAINST THE RAILWAY WORKERS
THERE ARE NO ARMS AVAILABLE
APPEAL TO WORK HARD APPEAL OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET THE PETROGRAD COUNCIL OF PROFESSIONAL UNIONS AND THE PETROGRAD COUNCIL OF FACTORY SHOP COMMITTEES TO THE WORKERS OF PETROGRAD URGING THEM TO WORK HARD AND NOT TO STRIKE
BUT ALL AROUND THEM THE SOVIET TROOPS WERE MUSTERING
NAY FURTHERMORE RETURNING POLITICAL EXILES WERE BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNTRY AS UNDESIRABLE CITIZENS
NO HIRED LABOUR IS PERMITTED
QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE BOURGEOIOISIE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL BOURGEOIS HOUSEHOLDS IN MOSCOW BY THE MOSCOW MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITEE SO AS TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE REQUISITION OF CLOTHING FOR THE ARMY AND THE POOR WORKERS
FROM BELOW ON THE SPOT WILL BE DECIDED THE QUESTIONS OF DIVISION OF THE LAND
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VL
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VL

PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VL
IN THE SOUTH WING ON THE SECOND FLOOR WAS THE GREAT HALL OF MEETINGS THE FORMER BALL-ROOM OF THE INSTITUTE
WE CAN'T LET YOU PASS
TWO HUNDRED MEN BEGAN TO SHOVEL IN THE DIRT
NATIONAL AUTONOMY NO LONGER SUFFICES
IT IS COMPOSED OF KORNILOVTSI
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH AT THIS MOMENT THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE WORKING-CLASS HAS MUCH MORE INTEREST IN THE PROPER AND UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION OF FACTORIES
TO REPORT IMMEDIATELY ALL THAT HAPPENS IN THE DISTRICT UNDER CHARGE TO THE STAFF OF THE PETROGRAD MILITARY DISTRICT
IF EVER MEN STOOD ALONE THE HANDFUL OF BOLSHEVIKI APPARENTLY STOOD ALONE THAT GREY CHILL MORNING WITH ALL STORMS TOWERING OVER THEM
WE REFUSE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO COVER UP ONE DAY OF THIS WORK
ALL THESE DECLARATIONS COST HUMAN LIVES
THE DEADLY FIRE OF THE SAILORS THE RED GUARDS AND THE SOLDIERS FORCED THE COSSACKS TO RETREAT
THE KUBAN DECLARED ITSELF AN INDEPENDENT COSSACK STATE
ON ONE SIDE THE MONARCHIST PRESS INCITING TO BLOODY REPRESSION--ON THE OTHER LENIN'S GREAT VOICE ROARING INSURRECTION
ALREADY THE MACHINERY HAD BEEN SET UP BY WHICH THE LAND OF THE GREAT ESTATES COULD BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE PEASANTS
WRITE
BOLSHEVIKI CAPTURE OF THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE THE BALTIC STATION THE TELEGRAPH AGENCY
THE FIGHTING HAD BEEN FURIOUS HERE
UNARMED WE WILL EXPOSE OUR BREASTS TO THE MACHINE GUNS OF THE TERRORISTS
IF ONE RECOGNISES A GOVERNMENT BY BAYONET CONTINUED THE OLD MAN ADDRESSING THE DUMA WELL WE HAVE ONE
AT THE INNER GATE TOO THERE WAS A BLAZE BY THE LIGHT OF WHICH THE SENTRIES SLOWLY SPELLED OUT OUR PASSES AND LOOKED US UP AND DOWN
A CRUSHING DEFEAT IS NECESSARY
CRIES YOU ARE ANTICIPATING THE WILL OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS TROTZKY COLDLY THE WILL OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS BEEN ANTICIPATED BY THE RISING OF THE PETROGRAD WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SO WE CAME INTO THE GREAT MEETING-HALL PUSHING THROUGH THE CLAMOROUS MOB AT THE DOOR
A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS SLOUCHING AT THE ENTRANCE ASKED EAGER QUESTIONS
LITTLE MATTER TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THE MOTIVES OF THESE PEOPLE LITTLE MATTER IF THEY ACT CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY
THE FINLAND DIVISION THE NEW COMMITTEES OF THE FIFTH AND TWELFTH ARMIES OFFER ALLEGIANCE
WAS IT TRUE THAT IN A FREE COUNTRY A LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE COULD CONTROL A WHOLE CITY AND EXPLOITED IT FOR THEIR PERSONAL BENEFIT
THE WORKERS WILL IN EVERY WAY ABSOLUTELY AND ENTIRELY SUPPORT THE PEASANTS ARRANGE FOR THEM ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH MACHINES AND TOOLS AND IN RETURN THEY REQUEST THE PEASANTS TO HELP WITH THE TRANSPORT OF GRAIN
THE WAR IS ENDED
THEN CAME THE VOTE ON THE CONSTITUTION OF POWER WHICH CARRIED THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS INTO OFFICE BY AN ENORMOUS MAJORITY
I PROPOSE THAT WE CALL THE CONGRESS OF PEASANTS AND DO IT IMMEDIATELY THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AGREED
AFTER A MINUTE'S OBSERVATION SHE LED US IN--A PLACID-LOOKING MIDDLE-AGED LADY WHO AT ONCE CRIED KYRIL IT'S ALL RIGHT IN THE DINING-ROOM WHERE A SAMOVAR STEAMED ON THE TABLE AND THERE WERE PLATES FULL OF BREAD AND RAW FISH A MAN IN UNIFORM EMERGED FROM BEHIND THE WINDOW-CURTAINS AND ANOTHER DRESSED LIKE A WORKMAN FROM A CLOSET
IN JULY THEY WERE HUNTED AND DESPISED
A STREET-CAR CRAWLED DISTANTLY ALONG A FAR-FLUNG SUBURB
I SUDDENLY REALISED THAT THE DEVOUT RUSSIAN PEOPLE NO LONGER NEEDED PRIESTS TO PRAY THEM INTO HEAVEN
LIKE A BLACK RIVER FILLING ALL THE STREET WITHOUT SONG OR CHEER WE POURED THROUGH THE RED ARCH WHERE THE MAN JUST AHEAD OF ME SAID IN A LOW VOICE
NEVER HAVE I SEEN MEN TRYING SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND TO DECIDE
BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES WITH THE OTHER FACTIONS WHICH WHOLE-HEARTEDLY OR HALF-HEARTEDLY SUPPORTED THEM WERE THE SO-CALLED MODERATE SOCIALISTS THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND SEVERAL SMALLER PARTIES
THEN LENIN CALM UNEMOTIONAL HIS FOREHEAD WRINKLED AS HE SPOKE SLOWLY CHOOSING HIS WORDS
LIST OF REGIMENTS WHERE THERE ARE COMMISSARS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
AS I CROSSED THE PALACE SQUARE SEVERAL BATTERIES OF YUNKER ARTILLERY CAME THROUGH THE RED ARCH AT A JINGLING TROT AND DREW UP BEFORE THE PALACE
TO THE RAILWAY WORKERS TO MAINTAIN ORDER ESPECIALLY NOT TO DELAY THE TRANSPORT OF FOOD TO THE CITIES AND THE FRONT
IN PRIVATE PUBLICATIONS OR UNDER A MASQUED FORM WILL ALSO BE SEVERELY PENALISED
HOW IS ITS SPHERE OF COMPETENCE DETERMINED
AND NARODNOYE SLOVO_(PEOPLE'S WORD-POPULIST SOCIALIST
COMPLETE WORKERS SELF-GOVERNMENT OF ALL INSURANCE INSTITUTIONS
WE ARE READY TO DIE IF YOU HAVE THE HEART TO FIRE ON RUSSIANS AND COMRADES
XII SECT
OUTSIDE OF THAT THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE WAY
THIS DID NOT PREVENT TWO ADMIRALS FROM RUNNING AWAY AT THE MOONSUND BATTLE
WE MUST CREATE A POWER WHICH WILL BE RECOGNISED BY THE WHOLE DEMOCRACY
THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES HATED THE BOLSHEVIKI WITH AN IMPLACABLE HATRED
THERE IS NO MIDDLE COURSE THAT SAME AFTERNOON PAUL MILIUKOV LEADER OF THE CADETS MADE A BRILLIANT BITTER SPEECH SEE APP
I ASKED SOME OF THEM WHICH SIDE THEY WERE ON
ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS--BOTH IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE PROVINCES
BUT IT WAS A HEAVY BLOW--THAT COULD BE SEEN IN THE CONCERN ON THE FACES OF THE PRESIDIUM
THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 28TH 1917 IZVIESTIA ORGAN OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE WHICH SAID SPEAKING OF THE LAST PROVISIONAL MINISTRY
BENEATH ALL THIS EXTERNAL ROTTENNESS MOVED THE OLD-TIME DARK FORCES UNCHANGED SINCE THE FALL OF NICHOLAS THE SECOND SECRET STILL AND VERY ACTIVE
AMID THE WILDEST CONFUSION EHRLICH OFFERED A RESOLUTION APPEALING TO THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS TO REMAIN CALM AND NOT TO RESPOND TO PROVOCATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE RECOGNISING THE NECESSITY OF IMMEDIATELY CREATING A COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND ASKING THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AT ONCE TO PASS DECREES TRANSFERRING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND BEGINNING PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
THE SOVIET IS CONVINCED THAT THE PROLETARIAT OF THE COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE WILL AID US IN CONDUCTING THE CAUSE OF SOCIALISM TO A REAL AND LASTING VICTORY
IF THIS SAVIOUR OF THE COUNTRY WAS NOT ABLE TO BETRAY PETROGRAD IT WAS DUE TO REASONS OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL
BITTER DAMP WINDS RUSHED IN FROM THE GULF OF FINLAND AND THE CHILL FOG ROLLED THROUGH THE STREETS
I REPEAT I KNOW PRACTICALLY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND I DID NOT LEAD ANY ARMY EXCEPT THIS ARMY HE POINTED TO THE PEASANT DELEGATES WHICH I AM LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING HERE LAUGHTER AND SHOUTS OF BRAVO UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY
AND IT WAS NOT FABLES FALSIFIED HISTORY DILUTED RELIGION AND THE CHEAP FICTION THAT CORRUPTS--BUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC THEORIES PHILOSOPHY THE WORKS OF TOLSTOY GOGOL AND GORKY
THE FUNCTIONARIES REFUSED TO RECOGNISE HIM LOCKED THEMSELVES IN AND WHEN THE DOORS WERE FORCED RESIGNED
AND YOU WILL DEFEND THE CITY AGAINST THEM OH DEAR NO HE SMILED
LET THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL ENCOUNTER A FIRM POWER AND PERHAPS AT THE LAST MOMENT GOOD SENSE CONSCIENCE AND HONOUR WILL TRIUMPH IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO STILL POSSESS THEM ALL THROUGH THIS SPEECH THE HALL RANG WITH DEAFENING CLAMOUR
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THAT WE ARE BEARING AS CITIZENS OF UNHAPPY RUSSIA WE HAVE NOT FOR ONE HOUR ABANDONED OUR HEAVY AND RESPONSIBLE WORK OF SUPPLYING THE ARMY AND POPULATION WITH PROVISIONS
IT WAS 10.40 P
THE NAKAZ EMBRACED THE GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN POINT OF VIEW SAID MILIUKOV
THE COURIERS ARE RESPECTFUL BUT THEIR FACES WEAR A CAUSTIC EXPRESSION
HOLD-UPS INCREASED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO WALK DOWN SIDE STREETS
FROM ACROSS THE RIVER WHERE LOOMED THE DARKER MASS OF PETER-PAUL CAME A HOARSE SHOUT
IT WILL SOON BE THREE YEARS AND A HALF THAT THIS ACCURSED WAR HAS GONE ON A WAR DEVISED BY THE CAPITALISTS AND LANDOWNERS OF ALL COUNTRIES FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT THEIR WORLD ROBBERIES
CARLYLE IN HIS FRENCH REVOLUTION HAS DESCRIBED THE FRENCH PEOPLE AS DISTINGUISHED ABOVE ALL OTHERS BY THEIR FACULTY OF STANDING IN QUEUE RUSSIA HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TO THE PRACTICE BEGUN IN THE REIGN OF NICHOLAS THE BLESSED AS LONG AGO AS 1915 AND FROM THEN CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1917 WHEN IT SETTLED DOWN AS THE REGULAR ORDER OF THINGS
LENIN TROTZKY LUNATCHARSKY
AT THE SAME TIME THEY WITHDREW FROM THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC STATING THAT THEY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN A GOVERNMENT OF TREASON TO THE PEOPLE SEE APP
AS MEMBERS OF THE WORKING-CLASS YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY MEMBERS OF THE WORKING-CLASS INDEED
THEY'RE DOWN CELLAR NOW
THIS PAPER STANDS FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE--THE POOR CLASSES WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
THEN EVERYBODY SMOKERS AND ALL TOOK UP THE CRY DON'T SMOKE COMRADES AND WENT ON SMOKING
HOW ABOUT ARRESTING AN AMBASSADOR AND SIGNING AN ARMISTICE OR A PEACE TREATY WITH HIM
AND FROM THE OTHER SIDE COME ALSO RUMOURS--RUMOURS THAT THE DARK FORCES THE FRIENDS OF THE TSAR THE GERMAN SPIES ARE RUBBING THEIR HANDS WITH GLEE
A PROCLAMATION OF THE COMMITTEE TO FIGHT AGAINST POGROMS ATTACHED TO THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT IS OFFICALLY PROCLAIMED WHEN IT IS ANNOUNCED THAT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC IS TO BE A CONSULTATIVE AND NOT LEGISLATIVE BODY
IT WAS KRYLENKO
THE SOVIETS OF ROSTOV-ON-DON AND YEKATERINBURG WERE DISPERSED BY ARMED COSSACKS AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE COAL MINERS UNION AT KHARKOV RAIDED
I SAT ONE EVENING IN A TRAKTIR_--A KIND OF LOWER-CLASS INN--ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GATES OF SMOLNY
THEY WERE PALE AND DISTRACTED AND EVIDENTLY HADN'T SLEPT
THEN THERE WAS THE BUSINESS OF OPENING THE BRIDGES
THERE IS ONLY ONE COALITION POSSIBLE--THE COALITION OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND POOREST PEASANTS
DRIVING ALONG OR WAITING FOR A FARE ON THE CORNER HE SAID ALL OF A SUDDEN POOFF A CANNON BALL EXPLODING HERE POOFF A CANNON BALL THERE RATT-RATT A MACHINE-GUN
NEWS CAME
THAT IS WHY WE ADDRESS OURSELVES ESPECIALLY TO THE WORKERS OF FRANCE ENGLAND AND GERMANY
FOR THE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING INTERESTED IN THE MORE PERMANENT LEGISLATIVE ORGANS--THE MUNICIPAL DUMAS AND THE ZEMSTVS
I WAS A COMMISSAR OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ATTACHED TO THE GENERAL STAFF BUT IN NO SENSE A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT LET HIM GO SAID A SAILOR
TO MAKE THE PEASANTS FORGET ABOUT THE LAND LENIN APPEARED FOR A MOMENT TO ANSWER THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
SEVERAL THOUSAND SAILORS WERE MASSED THERE BRISTLING WITH RIFLES
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
IN 1917 HOWEVER IT HAD BECOME THE POLITICAL EXPRESSION OF THE MORE PROSPEROUS PEASANTS TO FIGHT THE GROWING POWER AND REVOLUTIONARY AIMS OF THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES
HERE THERE WAS DOUBT AND DEPRESSION
KALEDIN ATAMAN OF THE DON COSSACKS HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FOR HIS COMPLICITY IN THE KORNILOV AFFAIR
WE ARE THE GUARD ANSWERED ONE
ONLY THREE NEWSPAPERS WERE OUT--_PRAVDA DIELO NARODA AND NOVAYA ZHIZN ALL OF THEM DEVOTED MUCH SPACE TO THE NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT
THE SECRETARY OF THE PETROGRAD BRANCH OF THE CADET PARTY TOLD ME THAT THE BREAK-DOWN OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC LIFE WAS PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT THE REVOLUTION
SO HE CAME AT LAST TO ROOM 17 OFFICE OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND STOOD THERE IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE FURIOUS COMING AND GOING
WHAT ARE THE MEASURES PROJECTED OR PUT INTO EFFECT FOR THE TRANSFER OF LAND FROM THE LAND-OWNERS TO THE LAND COMMITTEES AND SIMILAR BODIES APPOINTED BY THE SOVIETS

THE BUND GROUP JOINS WITH THE DECLARATION OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND WILL LEAVE THE CONGRESS HE RAISED HIS VOICE AND HAND
MY FAMILIA NAME IS PETERSON--I SPEAK FOR THE SECOND LETTISH RIFLES
IN THIS FEARFUL TIME THROUGH WHICH REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA IS PASSING ANY INSURRECTION CAN EASILY TURN INTO CIVIL WAR AND THERE CAN RESULT FROM IT THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL ORGANISATIONS OF THE PROLETARIAT BUILT UP WITH SO MUCH LABOUR
WE WANT NO COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE--NO
THE TSAY-EE-KAH WAS PRACTICALLY DEAD HE SAID AND THE RESOLUTION WAS SIMPLY A TRICK TO BOLSTER UP ITS WANING POWER
IT WAS PIANIKH MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS AND HE WAS MAD CLEAN THROUGH
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
ALL EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS OF ALL KINDS WHO REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH THIS DECREE SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE AS ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION AND OF THE MASS OF THE POPULATION BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS
LIEBER CRIED THAT THE CONVENTION OF SOVIETS WAS NOT A LEGAL CONVENTION THAT THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH WAS STILL IN OFFICE
THE ASSEMBLY HEARD HIM COLDLY INTERRUPTING WITH IRONICAL REMARKS
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT KERENSKY IS A PROVOCATOR BUT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT RIGHT FOR RUSSIAN MEN TO BE SHOOTING RUSSIAN MEN IN THE STATION COMMANDANT'S OFFICE WAS A BIG JOVIAL BEARDED COMMON SOLDIER WEARING THE RED ARM-BAND OF A REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE
THEREFORE WORKERS CONTROL IS DEMANDED BY THE PROLETARIAT NOT ONLY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST BUT IN THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY PEASANTRY AS WELL AS THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IN PETROGRAD THERE WERE NINETEEN TICKETS IN PETROGRAD
RESOLUTION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES WORKERS CONTROL 1
AS A SOCIAL REVOLUTION AND EXPRESSES ITS UNALTERABLE WILL TO PUT INTO OPERATION WITH WHATEVER MODIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY BUT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION THE SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
IT WAS NOW AFTER THREE IN THE MORNING
HAS DEFINITELY LOST THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD BEING IN COMPLETE DISACCORD WITH ITS STATE OF MIND AND ITS ASPIRATIONS
3)--SECOND THE CREATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT
WHAT DID YOU MAKE A REVOLUTION FOR
THEIR FUNCTION WAS BY REVOLUTIONARY ACTION TO TAKE OVER AND RUN THE FACTORIES
KINDLY MAKE THE PROPER DISPOSITIONS THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE
THEATRES MURAVIOV
YES WE HAVE SOME VERY COMFORTABLE ROOMS BUT ALL THE WINDOWS ARE SHOT OUT
THE RAILWAY MEN AND TELEGRAPHERS REFUSED TO TRANSMIT THEIR DESPATCHES THE POSTMEN WOULD NOT HANDLE THEIR MAIL
OF THE SOVIETS OF W
AS FOR THE BOURGEOIS PRESS HERE IN MOSCOW THERE WAS NO MORE BOURGEOIS PRESS
LET THOSE WHO HAVE NO LONGER FAITH IN THE REVOLUTION RETIRE
THUS ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED IN SEPTEMBER BUT THE TSAY-EE-KAH_[2 WOULD NOT CALL THE MEETING ON THE GROUND THAT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WAS ONLY TWO MONTHS AWAY AT WHICH TIME THEY HINTED THE SOVIETS WOULD ABDICATE
ALEXEI VINOGRADOV D
THERE ARE 17 GRAPHIC FIGURES IN THE TEXT
SO-AND-SO WAS TO MAKE THE ROUND OF THE MINISTRIES
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN RUSSIA TO-DAY IS THE PEASANTS REVOLUTION
IF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD ONLY STAND ASIDE AND WAIT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL INTO THEIR HANDS
THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY ARE THREATENED WITH FAMINE
COMMISSARS
DECREES WILL BE PREPARED IMMEDIATELY UPON THE FORMATION OF A COMMISSION ON NATIONALITIES
15-40 223-77 138-36
THEN SOME MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS ENTERED THE HALL TO CHEERS
WHO IS THIS HE ASKED ROUGHLY
I FULLY REALISE THE GRAVITY OF THIS DECISION





















REVOLUTIONARY FINANCIAL MEASURE ORDER IN VIRTUE OF THE POWERS VESTED IN ME BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES I DECREE
EVERY MILITARY UNIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS AND WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF ITS GARRISON TO AFFORD EVERY ASSISTANCE TO THE MUNICIPALITY TO THE COMMISSARS AND TO THE MILITIA IN THE GUARDING OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS
WE FEEL THAT OUR GOVERNMENT ENTRUSTED TO THE PERSONNEL OF THE PROVISIONAL CABINET IS A PITIFUL AND HELPLESS GOVERNMENT WHICH ONLY AWAITS THE SWEEP OF THE BROOM OF HISTORY TO GIVE WAY TO A REALLY POPULAR GOVERNMENT
RIDICULE OF THE NEW REGIME FROM DRUG NARODA MENSHEVIK NOVEMBER 18TH
THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED HIM LENIN LISTENED TO NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
SOMETIMES ARMED MEN LOOMED UP AHEAD CRYING SHTOI AND RAISING THEIR GUNS BUT OUR CHAUFFEUR ONLY YELLED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE AND WE HURTLED ON
A GERMAN WHO ARE YOU
THE WORK IS SIMPLY FALLING OUT OF OUR HANDS
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS REJOICE IN THE PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNES
CONSTITUTION
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS AFFAIR I WAS WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF MY PARTY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY AGAINST IT--AND WHAT COULD I DO
IF THE GOSPODIN DOES NOT MIND A LITTLE FRESH AIR DOWN THE TVERSKAYA THE SHOP-WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND THERE WERE SHELL-HOLES AND TORN-UP PAVING STONES IN THE STREET
3 TSERETELLI
THEY WERE ALL IN HIGH SPIRITS
BLIND PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT HUNGRY PEOPLE BETRAYED BY ADMIRALS AND GENERALS DO NOT TAKE AN INTEREST IN VOTING
WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT FOLLOW IT
BUT THE TSAY-EE-KAH NOT ONLY SUPPORTED HIS APPOINTMENT BUT REFUSED TO DEMAND THAT THE COSSACKS BE RECALLED FROM THE DON BASIN
THERE MUST BE NO FURTHER DELAY
IT HAS NO MORAL AUTHORITY AND IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE NECESSARY APPARATUS TO USE FORCE
HE TURNED TO US
AND AT THE MENTION OF PALTCHINSKY A STORM OF HOOTS ANGRY CRIES CHEERS BURST FORTH
TO INFORM THE COUNCIL BY DIRECT WIRE IMMEDIATELY OF ANY AND ALL STEPS IN THE POURPARLERS WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ENEMY ARMIES
23D 1917
THE MUNICIPALITIES MAY ESTABLISH A SERVICE OF INSPECTION OF DWELLING-PLACES ORGANISE IT AND DEFINE ITS POWERS
HE WAS A VOLUNTEER A UNIVERSITY STUDENT AND AS WE ROLLED DOWN THE STREET SHOUTED OVER HIS SHOULDER TO ME PHRASES OF EXECRABLE GERMAN
A STEADY STREAM OF COURIERS AND COMMISSARS CAME AND WENT
THE TWELFTH ARMY HAS BEEN INSISTING FOR A LONG TIME UPON THE RE-ELECTION OF THE GREAT SOVIET AND THE ARMY COMMITTEE BUT JUST AS YOUR OWN TSAY-EE-KAH OUR COMMITTEE REFUSED TO CALL A MEETING OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MASSES UNTIL THE END OF SEPTEMBER SO THAT THE REACTIONARIES COULD ELECT THEIR OWN FALSE DELEGATES TO THIS CONGRESS
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MACHINE-GUNS OVER THERE HE SAID LAUGHING AND WE COULDN'T GET ANY FROM SMOLNY
VERKHOVSKY WAS GIVEN INDEFINITE LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR ILL-HEALTH AND LEFT THE GOVERNMENT
ON THE 16TH IN A MEETING OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES INSISTED THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI SHOULD FORM A COALITION GOVERNMENT WITH THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES
KALEDIN IS THREATENING THE SOVIETS IN THE PROVINCE OF THE DON
LEAVE CALMLY AND OPENLY SO THAT EVERY ONE CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT RUNNING AWAY VERY WELL
COMMITTEE THE THRONG HALTED BANKED AROUND ME MUTTERING
EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE INDEPENDENT IN ITS COMMERCIAL RELATIONS AND MUST NOT BE OBLIGED TO OR PREVENTED FROM CONCLUDING AN ECONOMIC TREATY BY THE TREATY OF PEACE
INTERESTED AS WE WERE FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME WE DIDN'T NOTICE A CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF THE SOLDIERS AND RED GUARDS AROUND US
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING HE SENT WORD TO THE SECOND TSARSKOYE SELO RIFLES TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS
ORGANISE SOVIETS OF COSSACKS DEPUTIES
CHAPTER XI THE CONQUEST OF POWER SEE APP
AND I--AND I THE WHOLE ROOMFUL DECIDED ON THE SPOT TO GO TO TSARSKOYE SELO
THEY OBEY THE ORDERS OF FRENCH ENGLISH AND AMERICAN FINANCIERS
THE COSSACKS REPLIED THAT THEY DARE NOT COME BECAUSE A LARGE BODY OF SAILORS WITH TWO CANNON COMMANDED THEIR BARRACKS
NOVAYA ZHIZN WHILE PLEADING FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT THAT SHOULD UNITE ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES CRITICISED SEVERELY THE ACTION OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI IN QUITTING THE CONGRESS AND POINTED OUT THAT THE BOLSHEVIK INSURRECTION MEANT ONE THING VERY CLEARLY
THE END OF THE WAR AND THE DEMOBILISATION OF THE ARMY AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED THE DESERTER PROBLEM
WE RAN TO THE WINDOWS
TELEPHONES NO
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO RECAPTURE THE POST OFFICE AND THE TELEGRAPH AGENCY
THE RIGHT TO USE THE LAND IS GRANTED TO ALL CITIZENS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF SEX WHO WISH TO WORK THE LAND THEMSELVES WITH THE HELP OF THEIR FAMILIES OR IN PARTNERSHIP AND ONLY SO LONG AS THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK
THERE WILL BE PRIVATE THEATRICALS SUNDAY NIGHT SHE ANSWERED SEVERELY
CADETS--THAT IF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY THE SOVIETS WE SHALL NOT PERMIT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY TO DO THIS THING ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER 25TH TCHERNOV ARRIVED IN HOT HASTE FROM MOGHILEV SUMMONED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
THE WAGES OF THE RAILROAD MEN OF THE POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH EMPLOYEES MUST BE PAID
IT FLATTERING TRYING TO PLEASE THE UNENLIGHTENED PEOPLE TEMPTING THE WORKER AND SOLDIERS URGING THEM ON AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT PROMISING THEM MOUNTAINS OF GOOD THINGS
100 DELEGATES FROM THE PEASANTS SOVIETS--APPOINTED BY AVKSENTIEV AND 80 FROM THE OLD ARMY COMMITTEES WHO NO LONGER REPRESENT THE SOLDIER MASSES
AMONG THEIR LEADERS MENTIONED IN THESE PAGES
AN OLD SHVEITZAR RAN UP
DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE NOTES ISSUED BY TROTZKY TO THE ALLIES AND TO THE NEUTRAL POWERS AS WELL AS THE NOTE OF THE ALLIED MILITARY ATTACHES TO GENERAL DUKHONIN ARE TOO VOLUMINOUS TO GIVE HERE
THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY MUST NOT PERMIT TROOPS OF DOUBTFUL MORALE TO BE SENT TO PETROGRAD
THEY NEVER MOVED STOOD STARING WITH A SORT OF TERRIBLE INTENTNESS AT THE SPEAKER THEIR BROWS WRINKLED WITH THE EFFORT OF THOUGHT SWEAT STANDING OUT ON THEIR FOREHEADS
THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES WILL BE HEADED BY COLLEGIA_--COMMITTEES--INSTEAD OF BY MINISTERS AND WILL BE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE SOVIETS ON OCTOBER 30TH BY APPOINTMENT I WENT UP TO A SMALL BARE ROOM IN THE ATTIC OF SMOLNY TO TALK WITH TROTZKY
LONG LIVE THE PEASANTS SO THE GREAT PROCESSION WOUND THROUGH THE CITY GROWING AND UNFURLING EVER NEW RED BANNERS LETTERED IN GOLD
I MAKE NO SECRET OF MY POLITICAL OPINIONS BUT THE OTHERS DO NOT MIND BECAUSE THEY KNOW I DO NOT BELIEVE IN OPPOSING THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY
NEAR US ABOUT FIFTY MEN WERE LEFT STRANDED STUBBORNLY IN FAVOUR AND EVEN AS THE HIGH ROOF SHOOK UNDER THE SHOCK OF VICTORIOUS ROARING THEY TURNED AND RAPIDLY WALKED OUT OF THE BUILDING--AND SOME OF THEM OUT OF THE REVOLUTION
IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THE CONGRESS WERE HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED
SEND YOUR DELEGATES TO PETROGRAD TO TALK IT OVER WITH US
STAND UP AGAINST THIS DAMNED WAR
TO THE RIGHT WHITE AND GILDED AND COLOURED BULBS AND PINNACLES
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE HE SAID BITTERLY ARE SUFFERING FROM ECONOMIC FATIGUE--AND FROM DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE ALLIES
BY DIRECT DESCENT INHERITORS OF THE COMPROMISING TRADITION OF THE LABOUR GROUP IN THE FOURTH IMPERIAL DUMA WHICH WAS COMPOSED LARGELY OF PEASANT REPRESENTATIVES
FROM MOSCOW WORD THAT THE YUNKERS AND COSSACKS HAD SURROUNDED THE KREMLIN AND ORDERED THE SOVIET TROOPS TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS
THE CLAQUE NEAR ME KEPT UP A FEARFUL SHOUTING KHANJUNOV
IMMEDIATELY ON ALL SIDES THERE ARE CRIES THAT THE NEW SOCIALIST AUTHORITY IS IN THIS VIOLATING THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF ITS OWN PROGRAMME BY AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
RABOTCHI I SOLDAT WAS JUST OUT ALL ITS FRONT PAGE ONE HUGE PROCLAMATION
LOOK AROUND YOU
IN THE LOBBY WERE MANY OF THE SMART YOUNG OFFICERS WALKING UP AND DOWN OR MUTTERING TOGETHER
AGAIN RUMOURS ARE SPREADING AROUND THE TOWN OF AN INTENDED VYSTUPLENNIE WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THESE RUMOURS
THE ENEMY IS AT THE GATES OF PETROGRAD THE FORCES OF THE DEMOCRACY ARE TRYING TO ORGANISE TO RESIST HIM AND YET WE AWAIT BLOODSHED IN THE STREETS OF THE CAPITAL AND FAMINE THREATENS TO DESTROY NOT ONLY OUR HOMOGENEOUS GOVERNMENT BUT THE REVOLUTION ITSELF
IT IS ALL A MISTAKE
THEY CROWDED IT NOW PACKED CLOSE AROUND THE LITTLE TABLES WITH THEIR DIRTY TABLE-CLOTHS AND ENORMOUS CHINA TEA-POTS FILLING THE PLACE WITH FOUL CIGARETTE-SMOKE WHILE THE HARASSED WAITERS RAN ABOUT CRYING SEICHASS
WITHOUT A WORD YOU CARRIED YOUR CHAINS BECAUSE YOU COULD NOT IGNORE YOUR SUFFERING BROTHERS BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED THAT JUSTICE IS STRONGER THAN THE SWORD
IT IS AN OUTRAGE BUT IF IT IS YOUR OWN POLICY WHY DO YOU OBJECT
A RED FLAG CRUDELY LETTERED IN GOLD PEACE
SHONTS GREEN WITH ENVY
I TELL YOU THEY ARE PROVOCATORS
IN THE CROWDED CAR THERE WAS LESS HAPPY HILARITY THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE I THOUGHT
AT LENGTH GIVING IN HE READ THE RESOLUTION
HE DEMANDED THE KEYS OF THE ARCHIVES
PROVIDING THAT NEAR RELATIVES OF THE PERSONS RETIRING OR FRIENDS DESIGNATED BY THEM SHALL HAVE PREFERENCE IN THE REDISTRIBUTION OF THESE LANDS
THIS UKRAINE AND THIS FINLAND AND THE GERMAN IMPERIALISTS AND THE ENGLISH IMPERIALISTS
NOT TO SIGN THE ACT OF ARMISTICE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN PASSED UPON BY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
WE INVITE ALL DELEGATES TO THIS CONGRESS THE REST WAS LOST IN A STORM OF HOOTS MENACES AND CURSES WHICH ROSE TO A HELLISH PITCH AS FIFTY DELEGATES GOT UP AND PUSHED THEIR WAY OUT
FROM NOVEMBER 6TH TO NOVEMBER 23D I.E DURING 17 DAYS 500 MILLION RUBLES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE FRONT AND 120 MILLIONS TO MOSCOW BESIDES THE SUMS SENT TO OTHER TOWNS
IT IS NOT MADNESS
NO COMPROMISE WITH THE BOURGEOISIE IS POSSIBLE
CHAPTER VIII COUNTER-REVOLUTION NEXT MORNING SUNDAY THE 11TH THE COSSACKS ENTERED TSARSKOYE SELO KERENSKY SEE APP
BEFORE THE WORKERS OF RUSSIA OPEN NOW HORIZONS WHICH HISTORY HAS NEVER KNOWN
AT NIZHNI NOVGOROD THE SOVIET WAS IN CONTROL
YOUR COSSACKS DECLARE CATEGORICALLY THAT THEY WILL ARREST ME AND DELIVER ME TO THE SAILORS YES I ANSWERED THERE IS TALK OF IT AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY ANYWHERE BUT THE OFFICERS SAY THE SAME THING YES MOST OF ALL IT IS THE OFFICERS WHO ARE DISCONTENTED WITH YOU WHAT SHALL I DO
AN ICY WIND BLEW FROM THE GREAT PLAIN CUTTING TO THE BONE
I WENT TO THE STATE BANK TO SEE THE NEW COMMISSAR A REDHAIRED UKRAINEAN BOLSHEVIK NAMED PETROVITCH
ONLY THE HOPE OF THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM THE SOURCE OF A NEW AND SUPERIOR CULTURE BRINGS ME COMFORT
2 THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA TO FREE SELF-DETERMINATION EVEN TO THE POINT OF SEPARATION AND THE FORMATION OF AN INDEPENDENT STATE
LAND THE LEADING ARTICLE WAS SIGNED ZINOVIEV,"--LENIN'S COMPANION IN HIDING
I THINK KERENSKY WAS PERSUADED BY THE PETROGRAD GARRISON WHICH REFUSED TO OBEY HIM
YATMANOV B
YATMANOV B
A RED GUARD FINALLY EXASPERATED BY THE TAUNTS OF THE CROWD HAD SHOT INTO IT WOUNDING A YOUNG GIRL IN THE ARM
NOW HE TOLD ME HE WAS SECRETARY OF THE MOSCOW METAL-WORKERS UNION AND A COMMISSAR OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DURING THE FIGHTING
TRANSLATION COMMISSAR CHIEF BUREAU OF PRISONS 6TH OF NOVEMBER 1917
5.50 | 8
THE FOLLOWING TABLE WAS COMPILED BY THE ECONOMIC SECTION OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS DEPUTIES AND ACCEPTED AS CORRECT BY THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
WEEK BY WEEK FOOD BECAME SCARCER
THE SECOND PERIOD OF THE REVOLUTION THE PERIOD OF COMPROMISE WAS SIGNALLED BY THE ENTRANCE OF TCHERNOV INTO THE CABINET
THE CENTRE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES LED BY TCHERNOV JOINED WITH THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES LED BY KAMKOV AND SPIRIDONOVA THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS UNDER MARTOV AND THE CENTRE MENSHEVIKI,[6 REPRESENTED BY BOGDANOV AND SKOBELIEV IN DEMANDING A PURELY SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT
THEY FORGET THAT HE WAS RAISED TO POWER NOT ONLY BY THE SOVIETS BUT ALSO BY THE POPULAR MASSES
WE ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES
ALL THE JOURNALISTS EXPELLED FROM SMOLNY WERE THERE IN HIGH SPIRITS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS ARRESTED
HOW DID YOU GET HERE WITHOUT BEING KILLED HE ASKED POLITELY
EVERYTHING PERFECT COMRADE ANSWERED THE COMMANDANT
A BAR OF CHOCOLATE OR A POUND OF TASTELESS CANDY COST ANYWHERE FROM SEVEN TO TEN RUBLES--AT LEAST A DOLLAR
THEN THERE WERE THE ORGANISATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS THE FABRITCHNO-ZAVODSKIYE COMITIETI_--FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES
IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO-DAY THE SAME PHENOMENON IS VISIBLE
FOR SCIENCE AND ART HAVE ONLY IN SOME OF THEIR PARTS A GENERAL HUMAN IMPORTANCE
WHAT MORE CAN HAPPEN
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES CRIED KARELIN FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WANT TO EXPLOIT THE REVOLUTIONARY MACHINE OF THE STATE TO BIND RUSSIA TO THE WAR-CHARIOT OF THE ALLIES
AND THE LEFT WING CANNOT MAINTAIN ITSELF IN POWER UNLESS IT CAN SOLVE THESE QUESTIONS
VI SECT
IT HAD EVEN BEEN DECIDED TO ELECT A PROVISIONAL PEOPLE'S COUNCIL COMPOSED OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS--SEVENTY-FIVE REPRESENTING SMOLNY SEVENTY-FIVE THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH AND THE REST SPLIT UP AMONG THE TOWN DUMAS THE TRADE UNIONS LAND COMMITTEES AND POLITICAL PARTIES
I AM NOT TAKING PART IN THE NEGOTIATIONS
RISE FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION
IN HIS HAND HE CARRIED THE BIG REVOLVER
THEN RUSSIA WILL LOSE ALL PRESTIGE IN OTHER COUNTRIES OUR MONEY WILL LOSE ITS VALUE
THEY MUST BE WIPED OUT A MAN OF MILITARY MIND WHO ADMIRED POWER AND AUDACITY PERHAPS SINCERELY
WE THOUGHT THAT THE REVOLUTION WOULD BRING PEACE
MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS THE RADICAL WING OF THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS AND OPPOSED TO ALL COALITION WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
IN A ROOM WHERE FURNITURE WAS STORED WE CAME UPON TWO SOLDIERS RIPPING THE ELABORATE SPANISH LEATHER UPHOLSTERY FROM CHAIRS
AND I SERVE NOTICE HERE ON YOU COMRADES RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES--AND ON YOU MESSRS
NO LOAFING
BUT NOW THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
WE WANT LENIN OUTSIDE THE DUMA AN OFFICER WITH A WHITE ARM-BAND WAS TEARING DOWN POSTERS FROM THE WALL SWEARING LOUDLY
9 THE PARLEYING OF THE BRITISH KING WITH EXILED COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY GENERAL GURKO
COMRADE JOSEPHOV-DUKHVINSKI A SMILING YOUTH WITH A MOP OF PALE YELLOW HAIR MADE OUT PASSES FOR US
KALEDIN BEING IN POSSESSION OF THE COAL-MINES OF THE DON THE FUEL QUESTION BECAME URGENT
THE SAILORS BEGAN TO SURGE FORWARD
SO GREAT WAS HIS POWER THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO IGNORE HIS INSUBORDINATION
PROCLAMATION FOR WINE POGROMS REVOLUTIONARY LAW AND ORDER
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES INCLUDING SOME PEASANTS DEPUTIES CALLS UPON THE LOCAL SOVIETS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ENERGETIC MEASURES TO OPPOSE ALL COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ANTI-JEWISH ACTION AND ALL POGROMS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE
IN PETROGRAD THE BOURGEOISIE IN ALLIANCE WITH THE GERMANS WERE SABOTAGING THE FOOD AND AMMUNITION FOR THE ARMY
5 THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF STATE ACTIVITY SHALL BE INTRUSTED TO COMMISSIONS WHOSE COMPOSITION SHALL BE REGULATED TO ENSURE THE CARRYING OUT OF THE PROGRAMME OF THE CONGRESS IN CLOSE UNION WITH THE MASS-ORGANISATIONS OF WORKING-MEN WORKING-WOMEN SAILORS SOLDIERS PEASANTS AND CLERICAL EMPLOYEES
I ORDER ALL THE TROOPS OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT OF PETROGRAD WHO THROUGH MISTAKE OR FOLLY HAVE ANSWERED THE APPEAL OF THE TRAITORS TO THE COUNTRY AND THE REVOLUTION TO RETURN TO THEIR DUTY WITHOUT DELAY
THEY ACCUSE US OF REPELLING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC PARTIES
DRIVING HOME ACROSS ZNAMENSKY SQUARE WE MADE OUT AN UNUSUAL CROWD IN FRONT OF THE NICOLAI RAILWAY STATION
TRUE HE WAS A BOLSHEVIK AND THE AUTOMOBILE WAS COMMANDEERED FROM A BOURGEOIS
NO BARIN YOU MUST NOT GO IN THERE WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED TO KEEP THE SOLDIERS IN HE ANSWERED
THE FIRST CONGRESS OF PEASANTS SOVIETS HE SAID HAD VOTED A PRECISE AND FORMAL RESOLUTION IN FAVOUR OF PUTTING THE LANDED ESTATES IMMEDIATELY INTO THE HANDS OF THE LAND COMMITTEES
AN APPEAL TO THE PEASANTS OF RUSSIA WAS HASTILY DRAFTED AND A COMMITTEE OF FIVE ELECTED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT
THE PEASANTS ARE BEING EMANCIPATED FROM THE POWER OF THE LANDOWNERS FOR THERE IS NO LONGER THE LANDOWNER'S PROPERTY RIGHT IN THE LAND--IT HAS BEEN ABOLISHED
INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION ONE MUST EMPHASISE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION
THE WORKERS OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE RENDERED THE GREATEST SERVICES TO THE CAUSE OF PROGRESS AND OF SOCIALISM
ACROSS THE HORIZON SPREAD THE GLITTERING LIGHTS OF THE CAPITAL IMMEASURABLY MORE SPLENDID BY NIGHT THAN BY DAY LIKE A DIKE OF JEWELS HEAPED ON THE BARREN PLAIN
MASSED AGAINST THE SOVIET FORCES WERE YUNKERS COSSACKS LAND-OWNERS NOBILITY BLACK HUNDREDS--THE TSAR COME AGAIN OKHRANA AND SIBERIAN CHAINS
YOU SHALL GO TO THE OFFICERS CLUB WHERE THERE ARE SOME WHO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE HE LED ME ACROSS THE COURT-YARD TO THE DOOR OF ANOTHER BUILDING
THE ALLIES MUST BIND THEMSELVES NOT TO BEGIN ANY PEACE NEGOTIATIONS NOR TO CONCLUDE PEACE EXCEPT IN A GENERAL PEACE CONFERENCE WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM ALL THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES
COMRADE SOLDIERS AND COSSACKS ON US FALLS THE DUTY OF ASSURING REAL REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
AND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION ITSELF HAD REPUDIATED THE APPEAL TO THE GARRISON
THROUGHOUT RUSSIA PARTICULARLY AMONG THE CITY LABOURERS BUT ALSO AMONG THE PEASANTS A POWERFUL WAVE OF CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT HAS ARISEN
IN VIEW OF THE REVOLT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THEIR ATTEMPT TO DEPOSE THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND TO SEIZE THE POWER IN PETROGRAD
IT WOULD BE STRANGE TO WAIT IN ORDER TO BEGIN ACTION AGAINST AN AGITATION FOR POGROMS UNTIL THE POGROMS ACTUALLY OCCURRED NOVOYE VREMYA NOVEMBER 1
ONE FROM THE DEATH BATTALION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIRST ARTILLERY
THE SOVIET AND GARRISON OF LUGA THIRTY THOUSAND STRONG AFFIRMED ITS LOYALTY TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND APPEALED TO ALL RUSSIA TO RALLY AROUND IT
AND SO IF IN QUESTIONS OF NATIONAL DEFENCE YOU THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO HOLD SESSION IN SECRET ALSO IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY WE ARE SOMETIMES FORCED TO OBSERVE THE SAME SECRECY
AGAIN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BUND THE UNCOMPROMISING ATTITUDE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI WOULD MEAN THE CRUSHING OF THE REVOLUTION
PERHAPS NOW IT WILL RID US OF REVOLUTION ON THE FREEZING FRONT MISERABLE ARMIES CONTINUED TO STARVE AND DIE WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM
I WENT THERE ON A STREET-CAR MOVING SNAIL-LIKE WITH A GROANING NOISE THROUGH THE COBBLED MUDDY STREETS AND JAMMED WITH PEOPLE
THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS GAVE THE MAJORITY TO THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY
THE YUNKERS DEFENDED THEMSELVES DESPERATELY
LENIN'S LETTER TO THE COMRADES THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES APPEARED IN RABOTCHI PUT SEVERAL DAYS RUNNING AT THE END OF OCTOBER AND BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER 1917
BY TENS OF THOUSANDS THE WORKING-PEOPLE POURED OUT MEN AND WOMEN
EACH SENTENCE FALLING LIKE A HAMMER-BLOW
IT AMOUNTED PRACTICALLY TO A VOTE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE
AND ZINOVIEV CRYING THIS DAY WE HAVE PAID OUR DEBT TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIAT AND STRUCK A TERRIBLE BLOW AT THE WAR A TERRIBLE BODY-BLOW AT ALL THE IMPERIALISTS AND PARTICULARLY AT WILHELM THE EXECUTIONER THEN TROTZKY THAT TELEGRAMS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE FRONT ANNOUNCING THE VICTORIOUS INSURRECTION BUT NO REPLY HAD COME
AS FOR DUKHONIN HE GAVE NO SIGN
AT THE CORNER OF THE GOGOLIA RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER THE ENGINE STALLED
AND ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN ALL THE TOILING CLASSES THE SAME DISGUST IS EVIDENT
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE RUSSIAN MEETINGS AND CONVENTIONS ARE ORGANISED AFTER THE CONTINENTAL MODEL RATHER THAN OUR OWN
IF THE BOLSHEVIKI START ANYTHING THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE REVOLUTION CRIES THAT'S A LIE THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS ARE WAITING WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI TO BEGIN RIOTS AND MASSACRES
THROUGH AN IRREGULAR LANE THAT OPENED AND CLOSED AGAIN THE PROCESSION SLOWLY MOVED TOWARD US
WE BARE OUR BREASTS TO YOUR GUNS NO SAID THE SAILOR LOOKING STUBBORN I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO PASS WHAT WILL YOU DO IF WE GO FORWARD
THIS WAS THE DAY OF THE PEOPLE THE RUMOUR OF WHOSE COMING WAS THUNDEROUS AS SURF
IZVIESTIA AND GOLOS SOLDATA VOICE OF THE SOLDIER NEWSPAPERS FOUNDED BY THE PETROGRAD SOVIET BUT NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH FIERCELY ASSAILED IT AS DID THE ENTIRE ARTILLERY OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY PRESS DIELO NARODA PEOPLE'S CAUSE AND VOLIA NARODA PEOPLE'S WILL DELEGATES WERE SENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY MESSAGES FLASHED BY WIRE TO COMMITTEES IN CHARGE OF LOCAL SOVIETS TO ARMY COMMITTEES INSTRUCTING THEM TO HALT OR DELAY ELECTIONS TO THE CONGRESS
FULL RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION TO POLAND LITHUANIA AND LIVONIA
USTINOV READ THE NOTE ALOUD AND IMMEDIATELY ZINOVIEV WAS ON HIS FEET SCREAMING THAT THIS WAS A TRICK OF THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO CAPTURE THE CONVENTION
IT IS BENEATH OUR DIGNITY TO BE SHOT DOWN HERE IN THE STREET BY SWITCHMEN WHAT HE MEANT BY SWITCHMEN I NEVER DISCOVERED LET US RETURN TO THE DUMA AND DISCUSS THE BEST MEANS OF SAVING THE COUNTRY AND THE REVOLUTION WHEREUPON IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE THE PROCESSION MARCHED AROUND AND BACK UP THE NEVSKY ALWAYS IN COLUMN OF FOURS
SHAME UPON THOSE WHO ARE OF LITTLE FAITH HESITATE WHO DOUBT WHO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED BY THE BOURGEOISIE OR WHO SUCCUMB BEFORE THE CRIES OF THE LATTER'S DIRECT OR INDIRECT ACCOMPLICES
MONARCHISTS OF VARIOUS SHADES OCTOBRISTS ETC
AND ON THE LEFT ALMOST ALL THE DELEGATES WORE THE UNIFORMS OF COMMON SOLDIERS
A GREAT BEARDED SAILOR WITH THE CLEAR EYES OF YOUTH PROWLED RESTLESSLY ABOUT ABSENTLY TOYING WITH AN ENORMOUS BLUE-STEEL REVOLVER WHICH NEVER LEFT HIS HAND
WILL YOU GIVE IT BACK WHILE HE SPOKE HE KEPT HIMSELF UP BY SHEER EVIDENT EFFORT OF WILL AND AS HE WENT ON THE DEEP SINCERE FEELING BACK OF HIS WORDS BROKE THROUGH THE TIRED VOICE
POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY THERE WERE SEVENTEEN TICKETS IN PETROGRAD AND IN SOME OF THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS AS MANY AS FORTY
THE AMBASSADORS REMAIN SILENT
THE CENSOR WAS VERY MUCH EXCITED LIKE A SMALL BOY AT A CIRCUS
1 MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHO SUPPORTED THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY
MR MAYOR I SAID WE ARE AMERICAN CORRESPONDENTS
IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL OFFICIAL NEWS AND OF PRECISE DETAILS THIS CAMPAIGN PROVOKED DISCONTENT AMONG THE SOLDIERS
BUT IF YOU WISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE SOVIETS AND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
ONLY HALF A DOZEN TRAINED OPERATORS WERE AVAILABLE
PERHAPS--PERHAPS HOWEVER WE'LL MEET IN PRISON AGAIN WHEN WE GOT OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR AGAIN MY FRIEND WENT ON WITH HIS EXPLANATIONS
OVER SUCH BRANCHES OF ACTIVITY WHICH THE COMMITTEES CANNOT ASSUME THE CONTROL OF THE SOLDIERS SOVIETS IS ESTABLISHED
FROM KRYLENKO ORDER NUMBER TWO
BY WAVING ASSORTED PAPERS I MANAGED TO GET AROUND TO THE DOOR OF THE PRESS GALLERY
CERTAINLY THEY ARE COMING
IT HAD NO INTENTION OF CALLING THIS CONGRESS OR OF ALLOWING IT TO BE CALLED
ULIANOV LENIN PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR PUBLIC INSTRUCTION A
IT IS VERY DANGEROUS THEN HE TURNED TO THE MOB HOLDING UP OUR DOCUMENTS
AVKSENTIEV GAVE LITTLE BREAD
IN THE UPPER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS ZEMSTVOS COOPERATIVES--AND TRADE UNIONS OUTSIDE A CHILL DAMP WIND CAME FROM THE WEST AND THE COLD MUD UNDERFOOT SOAKED THROUGH MY SHOES
SMOLNY HAD DEMANDED SOME THIRTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF RUBLES FROM THE STATE BANK AND THE CASHIER HAD LOCKED THE VAULTS ONLY PAYING OUT MONEY TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE NEW TSAY-EE-KAH RESPONSIBLE TO FREQUENT MEETINGS OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS WILL BE THE PARLIAMENT
ABOLITION OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE ARMY RESTORATION OF THE FREE RIGHT OF PROPAGANDA RELEASE OF OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS ARRESTED FOR POLITICAL CRIMES ORDERS TO ARREST KERENSKY AND CONFISCATION OF FOOD SUPPLIES IN PRIVATE STORE-HOUSES
IF NOT PERHAPS WE SHALL BE FORCED TO OUT AGAIN ON THE NEVSKY WE SWUNG ON THE STEP OF A STREETCAR BULGING WITH PEOPLE ITS PLATFORMS BENT DOWN FROM THE WEIGHT AND SCRAPING ALONG THE GROUND WHICH CRAWLED WITH AGONISING SLOWNESS THE LONG MILES TO SMOLNY
EVEN THE CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE AT THE STAVKA THE MOST DETERMINED ENEMY OF SMOLNY TELEPHONED FROM MOGHILEV
IN THE NEW RUSSIA EVERY MAN AND WOMAN COULD VOTE
YESTERDAY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DECIDED TO RELEASE THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY AND MENSHEVIK MINISTERS MAZLOV SALAZKIN GVOZDOV AND MALIANTOVITCH--ON PRINCIPLE
WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO YOUR CONSUL AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
A TYPICAL CASE IS THAT OF PRINCE TUMANOV WHOSE BODY IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN MANY NEWSPAPERS HAD BEEN FOUND FLOATING IN THE MOIKA CANAL
CONTROL OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS AND THE RIGHT TO REPLACE THEM SHALL BELONG TO THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES AND ITS CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
FINALLY EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HALL THE DEMONSTRATION WORE ITSELF OUT SOMEWHAT
ONE OF THEM A GYPSY-FACED MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A LIEUTENANT SAID IN FRENCH EVERYTHING IS READY TO MOVE AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON THERE PASSED PODVOISKY THE THIN BEARDED CIVILLIAN WHOSE BRAIN CONCEIVED THE STRATEGY OF INSURRECTION
COMRADES WORKERS SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS OF REVOLUTIONARY PETROGRAD
IN THE DEVELOPING ENCOUNTER ALL SECTIONS OF THE TROOPS--THE SAILORS SOLDIERS AND THE RED GUARDS--SHOWED UNLIMITED COURAGE
WAIT TILL THE COSSACKS COME DUSK WAS ALREADY FALLING
WE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR LAND PROGRAMME
WE ARE NEUTRAL
AND THE KEY TO THE SITUATION THE STATE BANK IS ALSO SHUT
1 THE EQUALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA
THE GREAT HOTELS WHERE THE SPECULATORS STILL DID A THRIVING BUSINESS WERE SURROUNDED BY RED GUARDS AND THE SPECULATORS THROWN INTO JAIL
THE FACT THAT THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES OF THE SOVIETS THE CENTRAL ARMY AND FLEET COMMITTEES,[2 AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEES OF SOME OF THE UNIONS--NOTABLY THE POST AND TELEGRAPH WORKERS AND THE RAILWAY WORKERS--OPPOSED THE BOLSHEVIKI WITH THE UTMOST VIOLENCE
AS IN ALL SUCH TIMES THE PETTY CONVENTIONAL LIFE OF THE CITY WENT ON IGNORING THE REVOLUTION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
YOU HAVE BEEN PROMISED LAND AND FREEDOM BUT THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION WILL PROFIT BY THE ANARCHY CALLED FORTH BY THE BOLSHEVIKI AND WILL DEPRIVE YOU OF LAND AND FREEDOM
THIS IS CLASS WAR
PODVOISKY PRESIDENT OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
FIRST LENIN'S GENERAL RULES FOR THE PRESS ORDERING THE SUPPRESSION OF ALL NEWSPAPERS INCITING TO RESISTANCE AND DISOBEDIENCE TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT INCITING TO CRIMINAL ACTS OR DELIBERATELY PERVERTING THE NEWS
IN THE FIRST PART OF OCTOBER A COSSACK DELEGATION CALLED UPON KERENSKY ARROGANTLY INSISTING THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST KALEDIN BE DROPPED AND REPROACHING THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT FOR YIELDING TO THE SOVIETS
THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES ARE ABSOLUTELY AGAINST THIS POLICY OLD NICHOLAS TCHAIKOVSKY REPRESENTING THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS SPOKE AGAINST GIVING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND TOOK THE SIDE OF THE CADETS
THE WORKINGMEN ARE BEING EMANCIPATED FROM THE WHIMS AND ARBITRARY WILL OF THE CAPITALISTS FOR HENCEFORTH THERE WILL BE ESTABLISHED THE CONTROL OF THE WORKERS OVER MILLS AND FACTORIES
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR I HAVE NOT CEASED TO INSIST THAT IT IS A CRIME TO UNDERTAKE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS IN WAR-TIME
AT ANY RATE HERE WERE EIGHT MONTHS OF THE REVOLUTION GONE AND LITTLE ENOUGH TO SHOW FOR IT
YOU MIGHT THINK SAID TERESTCHENKO THAT WE WERE IN A MADHOUSE THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION WERE ASTOUNDED AT THE GENERAL'S WORDS
CONSEQUENTLY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ABOLISH THE MEASURES OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE PRESS
WITH THE DECREE ON THE NATIONALISATION OF BANKS THE FORMATION OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S ECONOMY THE PUTTING INTO PRACTICAL OPERATION OF THE LAND DECREE IN THE VILLAGES THE DEMOCRATIC REORGANISATION OF THE ARMY AND THE SWEEPING CHANGES IN ALL BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF LIFE,--WITH ALL THESE EFFECTIVE ONLY BY THE WILL OF THE MASSES OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS SLOWLY BEGAN WITH MANY MISTAKES AND HITCHES THE MOULDING OF PROLETARIAN RUSSIA
ONCE IT BEGINS THEY MUST BE DRAGGED ALONG WITH US OR ELSE LOSE THEIR FOLLOWING HERE HE HELD UP A PIECE OF PAPER
A VOICE YELLED DON'T YOU WISH WE WOULD PETROGRAD PRESENTED A CURIOUS SPECTACLE IN THOSE DAYS
THIS CAN BE DONE ONLY BY A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD SPEAK REALLY FOR THE WORKMEN SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS OF RUSSIA AND WOULD APPEAL OVER THE HEADS OF THE DIPLOMATS DIRECTLY TO THE GERMAN TROOPS FILL THE GERMAN TRENCHES WITH PROCLAMATIONS IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE
THE PEACEFUL POPULATION RECOGNISES THIS FACT
THERE IS NO DANGER TO US
LONG LIVE THE TOILING COSSACKS
OF COURSE THAT ONLY PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE NOT READY FOR REVOLUTION IT WAS JUST 8.40 WHEN A THUNDERING WAVE OF CHEERS ANNOUNCED THE ENTRANCE OF THE PRESIDIUM WITH LENIN--GREAT LENIN--AMONG THEM
THE MENSHEVIKI AND THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES CONQUERED THE CADETS AND THEN WHEN THEY GOT THE POWER THEY GAVE IT TO THE CADETS
WE URGENTLY ASK ALL CITIZENS TO EXERT EVERY EFFORT TO FIND WHATEVER POSSIBLE OF THE OBJECTS STOLEN FROM THE WINTER PALACE IN THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 7-8 AND TO FORWARD THEM TO THE COMMANDANT OF THE WINTER PALACE
THE LITTLE STREET CHAPELS ALONG OUR WAY WERE LOCKED AND DARK AS WAS THE CHAPEL OF THE IBERIAN VIRGIN WHICH EACH NEW TSAR USED TO VISIT BEFORE HE WENT TO THE KREMLIN TO CROWN HIMSELF AND WHICH DAY OR NIGHT WAS ALWAYS OPEN AND CROWDED AND BRILLIANT WITH THE CANDLES OF THE DEVOUT GLEAMING ON THE GOLD AND SILVER AND JEWELS OF THE IKONS
IN THE NAME OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS V
WE SHALL SEE
SUCH IS THE SECOND KORNILOV WHO NOW WANTS TO BUTCHER LIBERTY APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII 1
5 AS FOR KERENSKY--I REPRINT HERE THE DEPOSITION MADE BY GENERAL KRASNOV ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 14TH
NEVERTHELESS ALL NATIONS SHOULD BIND THEMSELVES BY THE PEACE TREATY NOT TO PRACTISE AN ECONOMIC BLOCKADE AFTER THE WAR NOR TO FORM SEPARATE TARIFF AGREEMENTS
5 AT THE TROITSKY FARCE THEATRE IN PETROGRAD FOR EXAMPLE A BURLESQUE CALLED SINS OF THE TSAR WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROUP OF MONARCHISTS WHO THREATENED TO LYNCH THE ACTORS FOR INSULTING THE EMPEROR CERTAIN NEWSPAPERS BEGAN TO SIGH FOR A RUSSIAN NAPOLEON IT WAS THE USUAL THING AMONG BOURGEOIS INTELLIGENTZIA TO REFER TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS DEPUTIES RABOTCHIKH DEPUTATOV AS SABATCHIKH DEPUTATOV--DOGS DEPUTIES
THIS WAS PROMISED
THE COSSACKS CAME EARLY IN THE MORNING
KARELIN WAS ON HIS FEET PROTESTING
ALBERT RHYS WILLIAMS WAS IN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
THE ENAMEL WOULD GET SCRATCHED HE SAID
KORNILOV PROVED THAT THE SOVIETS WERE REALLY A POWER
WE TOLD THE PEASANTS IF THEY DON'T GIVE IT TO YOU TAKE IT YOURSELVES AND THE PEASANTS FOLLOWED OUR ADVICE
AND VOLODARSKY AS HE CAME OUT TOLD ME WHAT WAS GOING ON
ALL REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD HAVE THEIR EYES ON YOU THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECREES
COOPERATIVES THESE WERE THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS CONSUMERS COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES WHICH HAD SEVERAL MILLION MEMBERS ALL OVER RUSSIA BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
THE BOLSHEVIKI THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS MARTOV'S FACTION AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS GORKY'S GROUP WERE IN FAVOUR OF FORCING THE ALLIES TO DECLARE DEMOCRATIC WAR-AIMS AND TO OFFER PEACE TO GERMANY ON THOSE TERMS
BUT THE DAMN THING ISN'T ANYWHERE NOW
AND WE SHALL ANSWER WITH AN OFFENSIVE WHICH WILL BE MERCILESS AND DECISIVE IT IS TRUE THAT THE PETROGRAD SOVIET HAD NOT ORDERED A DEMONSTRATION BUT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY WAS CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF INSURRECTION
THERE ARE TWO CLASSES DON'T YOU SEE THE PROLETARIAT AND THE BOURGEOISIE
SO THE BICYCLES WERE ABANDONED
WHERE'S KERENSKY THEY SAY ONLY EIGHT VERSTS FROM PETROGRAD
A DELEGATE OF THE COAL-MINERS OF THE DON BASIN CALLED UPON THE CONGRESS TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST KALEDIN WHO MIGHT CUT OFF COAL AND FOOD FROM THE CAPITAL
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE TRADE UNIONS--ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT
FROM WITHIN CAME A SOUND OF HAMMERING
HIS THIN POINTED FACE WAS POSITIVELY MEPHISTOPHELIAN IN ITS EXPRESSION OF MALICIOUS IRONY
COALITION DOESN'T ALWAYS ADD TO STRENGTH
THE POLK REGIMENT WAS ON DUTY AT THE GENERAL STAFF THE NIGHT OF THE 6TH
THE RED GUARD IS OUT ON THE STEPS OF SMOLNY IN THE CHILL DARK WE FIRST SAW THE RED GUARD--A HUDDLED GROUP OF BOYS IN WORKMEN'S CLOTHES CARRYING GUNS WITH BAYONETS TALKING NERVOUSLY TOGETHER
THEY ALL LOOKED VERY DEPRESSED AS UNDOUBTEDLY THEY WERE FROM WEEKS AND WEEKS OF ALL-DAY ALL-NIGHT ARGUMENT AND DEBATE
TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA
BUT THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHY THEY REFUSED TO GO
ONE OF THE PRIESTS FATHER IVAN KUTCHUROV WAS ARRESTED AND SHOT BY THE INFURIATED RED GUARDS
WITH THE ABOLITION OF THE RANK OF OFFICER ALL SEPARATE OFFICERS ORGANISATIONS ARE ABOLISHED
THE MASS SLOWLY BEGAN TO CLOSE IN LIKE WILD CATTLE AROUND A COWPUNCHER ON FOOT
7 RUMANIA TO BE RESTORED BUT FORCED TO GIVE COMPLETE SELF-DETERMINATION TO THE DOBRUDJA
IT WAS FIRMLY FIXED IN THE POPULAR MIND THAT THE EMPLOYEES WERE SABOTAGING STARVING THE ARMY STARVING THE PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE WAS A LITTER OF CIGARETTE-BUTTS BITS OF BREAD CLOTH AND EMPTY BOTTLES WITH EXPENSIVE FRENCH LABELS
ALL RIGHT SAID HE
CHAPTER IV THE FALL OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 7TH I ROSE VERY LATE
BUT THIS SHALL NOT BE FOR WE RESPECT THE DUMA
IN ADDRESSING THIS OFFER OF PEACE TO THE GOVERNMENTS AND TO THE PEOPLES OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES THE PROVISIONAL WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA ADDRESSES EQUALLY AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONSCIOUS WORKERS OF THE THREE NATIONS MOST DEVOTED TO HUMANITY AND THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONS AMONG THOSE TAKING PART IN THE PRESENT WAR--ENGLAND FRANCE AND GERMANY
AS FOR THE YUNKERS NOT ONE HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST INJURY UP THE NEVSKY IN THE EMPTY AFTER-MIDNIGHT GLOOM AN INTERMINABLE COLUMN OF SOLDIERS SHUFFLED IN SILENCE--TO BATTLE WITH KERENSKY
TO-DAY AT THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC IN ORDER TO AVOID BLOODSHED WE PASSED AN ORDER OF THE DAY DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE LAND TO THE LAND COMMITTEES AND IMMEDIATE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS LAUGHTER AND CRIES TOO LATE THEN FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI TROTZKY MOUNTED THE TRIBUNE BORNE ON A WAVE OF ROARING APPLAUSE THAT BURST INTO CHEERS AND A RISING HOUSE THUNDEROUS
THIS IS NOTHING BUT TIMIDITY EXPRESSED BY PESSIMISM AS REGARDS WORKERS AND SOLDIERS AND OPTIMISM AS REGARDS THE FAILURE OF THE BOURGEOISIE
FRIGHTENED THEY HUDDLED IN THE CORNERS AND THEN FINDING THEMSELVES SAFE GAVE VENT TO THEIR SPITE
SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE REALLY THE MINORITY BECOMING AGAIN THE MAJORITY IN SEPTEMBER 1917
THE REACTIONARIES SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVOKE POPULAR ANGER
ONLY THE GOLD AND COLOURED SPIRES AND CUPOLAS WITH HEIGHTENED BARBARIC SPLENDOUR GLEAMED THROUGH THE WHITE SNOW
HOW MUCH AND IN WHAT RESPECT DOES THE AMOUNT OF LAND NOW UNDER CULTIVATION DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNT FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AS AN AVERAGE MINIMUM
THE BARRICADES IN THE STREETS WERE BEING REMOVED
HE WAS FOUND SOME TIME LATER IN THE ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WITH A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET HOLE IN HIS TEMPLE
BEHIND SMOLNY WAS ONLY THE WILL OF THE VAST UNORGANISED POPULAR MASSES
THE NEW GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPS TO SECURE EVERYTHING NEEDFUL TO THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY BY MEANS OF A DETERMINED POLICY OF REQUISITION AND TAXATION OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES AND ALSO TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION OF SOLDIERS FAMILIES
BUT THAT IS CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SAID TERESTCHENKO FOR RUSSIA MUST HAVE FREE PORTS ON THE BALTIC ALL THE YEAR ROUND
WHY AREN'T THE RUSSIANS FIGHTING
BUT IN TELLING THE STORY OF THOSE GREAT DAYS I HAVE TRIED TO SEE EVENTS WITH THE EYE OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REPORTER INTERESTED IN SETTING DOWN THE TRUTH
ARMED COMMISSARS VISITED THE KRONVERSK ARSENAL AND SEIZED GREAT QUANTITIES OF ARMS AND AMMUNITION HALTING A SHIPMENT OF TEN THOUSAND BAYONETS WHICH WAS BEING SENT TO NOVOTCHERKASK HEADQUARTERS OF KALEDIN
THE PROMISE OF BREAD--A HOAX
THE CREWS OF THE TORPEDO-BOATS ON THE NEVA WERE SHAKY
AND YET WENT ON SCHREIDER THEY LOOK UPON US AS COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES AND REPORT US TO THE POPULATION
BY TENS OF THOUSANDS THE HUMMING SLUMS BELCHED OUT THEIR DUN AND MISERABLE HORDES
BITTER DEBATE ON TERESTCHENKO'S FOREIGN POLICY
BUT IT IS FORCE WHICH THE BOURGEOISIE LACKS
REMEMBER THAT YOU YOURSELVES DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS CALLS UPON YOU TO ENTER A NEW FRESH MORE HAPPY LIFE
IT GIVES ME THE RIGHT OF FREE TRAVEL TO THE NORTHERN FRONT--AND AN ADDED NOTE ON THE BACK EXTENDS THE PERMISSION TO ALL FRONTS
RED GUARDS STOOD SENTRY AT THE DOOR
ONLY A FACTION OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES OF THE LEFT WAS WITH US IN THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
NEW YORK JANUARY 1ST 1919
A COURIER REPORTED THAT THE COMMITTEE OF WELCOME SENT TO MEET KERENSKY AT THE RAILWAY STATION HAD BEEN ARRESTED
FOR INSTANCE AN INTELLIGENT YOUNG CADET FORMERLY PRIVATE SECRETARY TO MILIUKOV AND THEN TO TERESTCHENKO DREW US ASIDE AND TOLD US ALL ABOUT THE TAKING OF THE WINTER PALACE
ON THE OTHER A FRANTIC MOB MADE UP OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT CROWD THE SIDEWALKS OF FIFTH AVENUE AT NOON-TIME SNEERING ABUSING SHOUTING TRAITORS
CLIMBING THESE WE LOOKED DOWN INTO TWO MASSIVE PITS TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET DEEP AND FIFTY YARDS LONG WHERE HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS AND WORKERS WERE DIGGING IN THE LIGHT OF HUGE FIRES
WE HURTLED FURIOUSLY ON WRENCHED RIGHT AND LEFT TO AVOID COLLISIONS THAT SEEMED INEVITABLE SCRAPING WHEELS FOLLOWED BY THE EPITHETS OF PEDESTRIANS
IT WAS ALL UTTERLY SPONTANEOUS
ALL MINE NOW
FACTORIES AND MINES ARE CLOSING DOWN WORKMEN ARE THREATENED WITH STARVATION
DIELO NARODA SAID
THEY WERE ALL IN THIS MANNER
IN ALL THESE TOWNS SPRANG UP COMMITTEES FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION ARMING FOR CIVIL WAR
MINISTER-PRESIDENT OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPREME COMMANDER A
NOT A THING MOVED EXCEPT THE ICE OF LITTLE WOODLAND POOLS SHIVERING UNDER OUR FEET
SOMEBODY READ ALOUD AN ACCOUNT IN THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PAPER NAROD WHICH STATED THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION RUBLES WORTH OF DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE IN THE WINTER PALACE AND DESCRIBING IN GREAT DETAIL THE LOOT AND BREAKAGE
AT THIS DANGEROUS HOUR WHEN THE MUNICIPAL DUMA OUGHT TO USE EVERY MEANS TO CALM THE POPULATION TO ASSURE IT BREAD AND OTHER NECESSITIES THE RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE CADETS FORGETTING THEIR DUTY HAVE TURNED THE DUMA INTO A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY MEETING TRYING TO RAISE PART OF THE POPULATION AGAINST THE REST SO AS TO FACILITATE THE VICTORY OF KORNILOV-KERENSKY
AND FINALLY WE SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A PEOPLE'S COUNCIL ANYWAY
BEARING IN MIND HOWEVER THE FACT THAT ANY RESTRICTIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS EVEN IN CRITICAL MOMENTS ARE ADMISSIBLE ONLY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF NECESSITY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS DECREES AS FOLLOWS
UPON THIS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES DECLARED THEY COULD NO LONGER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WAS BEING DONE AND WITHDREW FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND ALL OTHER POSITIONS OF EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY
SO IT WAS BEGINNING
THE MAYOR ANNOUNCED THAT TROOPS WERE STATIONED AT ALL THE DOORS PROHIBITING ALL EXIT AND ENTRANCE AND THAT A COMMISSAR HAD THREATENED ARREST AND THE DISPERSAL OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA
ROMANTIC HAD BEEN THEIR EXPERIENCE PASSING UP CARTRIDGES AND DRESSING THE WOUNDS OF THEIR DASHING YOUNG DEFENDERS THE YUNKERS MANY OF THEM MEMBERS OF NOBLE FAMILIES FIGHTING TO RESTORE THEIR BELOVED TSAR
ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI RAPIDLY WINKED THE TEARS BACK
PETROVSKY ANARCHIST DELEGATE FROM THE OBUKHOV FACTORY MADE A SEAT FOR ME BESIDE HIM
TUESDAY MORNING NOVEMBER 6TH THE CITY WAS THROWN INTO EXCITEMENT BY THE APPEARANCE OF A PLACARD SIGNED MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD
THE LINE WHICH THE STATE COMMISSION RELYING UPON THE STATE COMMITTEE WILL FOLLOW WILL HARDLY SUFFER ANY MODIFICATION UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
SUCH TREATIES ARE DECLARED IN CONTRADICTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AND VOID
AS A RESULT OF THE DISASTROUS FAILURE OF THE RISING PUBLIC OPINION TURNED AGAINST THEM AND THEIR LEADERLESS HORDES SLUNK BACK INTO THE VIBORG QUARTER WHICH IS PETROGRAD'S ST ANTOINE THEN FOLLOWED A SAVAGE HUNT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
IN THE BARRACKS AND THE WORKING-CLASS QUARTERS OF THE TOWN THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE PREACHING ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS AND AGENTS OF THE DARK FORCES WERE URGING THE PEOPLE TO RISE AND SLAUGHTER THE JEWS SHOP-KEEPERS SOCIALIST LEADERS
THREE OF US MANAGED TO WEDGE OUR WAY INTO A COMPARTMENT BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TWENTY SOLDIERS ENTERED
ON THE SIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS THERE WAS NOT ONLY A SURPLUS IN QUANTITY AND SUCH A POWERFUL MATERIAL BASE AS PETROGRAD BUT ALSO AN ENORMOUS MORAL ADVANTAGE
1 DECLARED EMPHATICALLY FOR THE SOVIETS AND CONTINUED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER LIBERATING THEMSELVES POLITICALLY FROM TSARDOM THE WORKING-CLASS WANTS TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC REGIME TRIUMPHANT IN THE SPHERE OF ITS PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY
WE SUFFER THERE MORE FROM THE FRIENDSHIP OF OUR ALLIES THAN FROM THE ENEMY HE SAID
FROM THIS IT WAS AN EASY STEP TO SUPPORTING THEM
THIS ATTITUDE MEANS TO BUILD THE TACTICS OF A REVOLUTIONARY PARTY ON ONE OF THE BOURGEOISIE'S FORMER MISTAKES
THE GIRL IN CHARGE--A MEMBER OF PLEKHANOV'S YEDINSTVO_[9 GROUP--SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY
THEY DON'T DARE ARREST THE DUMA
IT WILL SUPPRESS IMMEDIATELY THE GREAT LANDED PROPERTY AND TRANSFER THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSIST THAT THE GOVERNMENT MACHINERY DOES NOT REMAIN PASSIVE WHILE THE THREAT OF BLOODY RIOTS ENDANGERS THE LIVES OF ITS CITIZENS 4
OCCASIONALLY THE CONDUCTOR CAME THROUGH AS A MATTER OF HABIT LOOKING FOR TICKETS
THE BOLSHEVIKI RAISED AGAIN THE SLOGAN SO DEAR TO THE MASSES ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS!"--AND THEY WERE NOT MERELY SELF-SEEKING FOR AT THAT TIME THE MAJORITY OF THE SOVIETS WAS MODERATE SOCIALIST THEIR BITTER ENEMY
BUT THE WORKING CLASSES ARE NOT FOR ONE MOMENT AFRAID OF THAT RESISTANCE
THEN KHINTCHUK AN OFFICER WITH A LONG BROWN GOATEE SPEAKING SUAVELY AND PERSUASIVELY
THE ATTEMPT OF KERENSKY TO MOVE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS AGAINST THE CAPITAL OF THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN DECISIVELY REPULSED
IN THE REAR THE LAND COMMITTEES ELECTED BY THE PEASANTS WERE BEING JAILED FOR TRYING TO CARRY OUT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE LAND
KERENSKY DID NOT ARRIVE AT PSKOV
THEY PROPOSED TO ASK THE GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS
THEN THE ARMY AS THE FRONT WILL REMAIN WITHOUT SUPPORT OUR BROTHERS IN THE TRENCHES WILL BE DELIVERED TO THE FIRE OF THE ENEMY
THE UNION OF RAILWAYMEN WAS DEMANDING THE RESIGNATION OF LIVEROVSKY MINISTER OF WAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS
SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF OUR PARTY AND THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS KAMENIEV ZINOVIEV NOGIN RYKOV MILIUTIN AND A FEW OTHERS LEFT YESTERDAY NOVEMBER 17TH THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF OUR PARTY AND THE LAST THREE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
SIGNED THE COSSACKS OF THE FIRST DIVISION OF USSURI CAVALRY
ALL THE RICHES BENEATH THE EARTH--ORES OIL COAL SALT ETC.--AS WELL AS FORESTS AND WATERS HAVING A NATIONAL IMPORTANCE BECOME THE EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OF THE STATE
ALL ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS ORGANS OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES AND SOLDIERS ORGANISATIONS ON THE FRONT SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ASSURE FREE AND REGULAR ELECTIONS AT THE DATE DETERMINED UPON
I'M A MARXIAN STUDENT
SEVERAL DAYS LATER THE ASSEMBLY WAS SUPPORTING THE MODERATES WITH TCHERNOV
ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO DISARM THE RED GUARD
THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES PROPOSED A HALF-HOUR INTERMISSION
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THEY HAD BEEN LEFT IN CAMP WITHOUT OFFICERS FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND BADLY TREATED BEFORE THEY BECAME REBELLIOUS
DO YOU HEAR IT FOR A MOMENT DEAD SILENCE AND THEN A LITTLE AHEAD AND TO THE LEFT THREE SHOTS IN RAPID SUCCESSION
WHO IS LENIN
3 YUNKERS CAME OUT IN BUNCHES OF THREE OR FOUR
1 TO DISSOLVE THE MUNICIPAL DUMA
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS THEIR OWN EMOTIONS THEIR OWN WAYS OF APPROACHING THE PROBLEMS OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIETY
BUT WE HAVE THEM NOW--THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY IMPOTENT
AVILOV TRIES TO FRIGHTEN US BY THE THREAT OF A PEACE AT OUR EXPENSE
WE APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE
AT OUR CONGRESS ARE REPRESENTED ALL THE CONSCIOUS ORGANISATIONS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS OF RUSSIA
ALL THE SMOLNY TELEPHONES WERE CUT OFF
NATURALLY THERE ARE MANY MANY WHO ARE CONTAMINATED BY THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE HE CHANGED THE SUBJECT
THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF SOVIETS IN THESE DAYS--IS BY DOING YOUR JOB
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DIVERSION WE SLIPPED PAST THE GUARDS AND SET OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WINTER PALACE
THE ORDER TO DUKHONIN WAS CHARACTERISED OPENLY AS AN ACT OF TREASON
THEY DID SO PROTESTING TO THE LAST BUT FINALLY CEDING TO VIOLENCE THE NEW DUMA WHICH WAS ELECTED TEN DAYS LATER AND FOR WHICH THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS REFUSED TO VOTE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BOLSHEVIK
BUT LISTEN--WHY SHOULD WE TALK OF SUCH THINGS
NOVAYA ZHIZN NEW LIFE GORKY'S PAPER CALLED ATTENTION TO THEIR ACTIVITIES
THE BOURGEOIS PRESS WAS JOYFUL
CONCLUDED AN OPEN ALLIANCE WITH GENERAL KORNILOV
THIS TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS
WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT THAT IS ONLY A PIPEDREAM
WE ARE ABANDONING THEM TO THE ENMITY OF ALL WORKERS SOLDIERS SAILORS AND PEASANTS ON WHOM THEY ARE TRYING TO RIVET THE ANCIENT CHAINS
AND THEY WERE STILL IN GOOD ORDER IN THE BASEMENT OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE THERE TEN DAYS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF THE KREMLIN BY BOLSHEVIK TROOPS
IT'S JUST PLAIN PRO-GERMAN ANARCHY OH YES I KNOW ANSWERED THE SOLDIER WITH SWEAT DRIPPING FROM HIS BROW
VIII SECT

FROM THE CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE THE TSENTROFLOT
WHETHER AN ARMED DEMONSTRATION IS NECESSARY WILL DEPEND ON
WE MUST ALL DEFEND HER WE MUST SHOW THAT WE ARE DEFENDERS OF A GREAT IDEAL AND CHILDREN OF A GREAT POWER NOBODY WAS SATISFIED
FIRST OF ALL THE CITY THE COUNTRY THE ARMY MUST BE FED
IT IS THE LUTTE FINALE THE BOURGEOIS COUNTER-REVOLUTION ORGANISES ALL ITS FORCES AND WAITS FOR THE MOMENT TO ATTACK US
COMMANDANT'S OFFICE 16TH NOVEMBER 1917 NO
NOW IT IS TIME TO GO ON TO THE SECOND AND TO PLAY IT AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
NO IT MUST BE ALTERED FOR EVER
ON EVERY CORNER IN EVERY OPEN SPACE THICK GROUPS WERE CLUSTERED
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO JOIN THE AMERICAN ARMY
ITS POWER MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED
SHOW ME THE SOURCE ZINOVIEV
WE'RE GETTING STRONGER EVERY DAY
INSISTS THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TAKE THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATE MEASURES IN THE ARMY
IF THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHAT ENDS THE ALLIES ARE PURSUING IT IS INDISPENSABLE FIRST TO DEMAND WHAT AIMS THE CENTRAL POWERS HAVE AGREED UPON
HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE HELP OF THE FRONT ARMIES FAITHFUL TO THEIR DUTY WITH THE HELP OF THE COUNCIL OF COSSACKS WHICH HAS UNITED UNDER ITS COMMAND ALL THE COSSACKS AND WHICH STRONG WITH THE MORALE WHICH REIGNS IN ITS RANKS AND ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE HAS SWORN TO SERVE THE COUNTRY AS ITS ANCESTORS SERVED IT IN THE TROUBLOUS TIMES OF 1612 WHEN THE COSSACKS OF THE DON DELIVERED MOSCOW MENACED BY THE SWEDES THE POLES AND THE LITHUANIANS
THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE HAVING A MEETING
ARE YOU GOING TO DISSOLVE THE DUMA I ASKED
FOR THE LAND COMMITTEES ARE PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE SOVIET DECREES BUT ARE PUTTING INTO OPERATION THEIR OWN PRACTICAL DECISIONS--DECISIONS BASED ON THE WILL OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PEASANTS
WHEN A PARTY IN FULL TIDE OF REVOLUTION STILL WREATHED IN POWDER-SMOKE COMES TO SAY HERE IS THE POWER--TAKE IT!'--AND WHEN THOSE TO WHOM IT IS OFFERED GO OVER TO THE ENEMY THAT IS NOT A MISUNDERSTANDING
THE DATE OF PUBLISHING IT IN THE OFFICIAL GAZETTE OF THE PROVISIONAL WORKMEN'S AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT IS THE DATE OF ITS BECOMING LAW
A COUCH LAY ALONG THE WALL AND ON THIS WAS STRETCHED A YOUNG WORKMAN
HE PROPOSED THAT A COMMITTEE BE SENT WITH A FORMAL INVITATION
FRENZIED BY DEFEAT AND THEIR HEAPS OF DEAD THE SOVIET TROOPS OPENED A TORNADO OF STEEL AND FLAME AGAINST THE BATTERED BUILDING
AND PALTCHINSKY HATED BY THE WHOLE DEMOCRACY
FIRMNESS STEADFASTNESS DISCIPLINE DETERMINATION
IVAN PAVLOVITCH TOLD ME WHAT HE HAD HEARD
ALL THOSE IN FAVOUR SHOULD GO TO THE RIGHT
THE GOVERNMENT ABOLISHES SECRET DIPLOMACY EXPRESSING BEFORE THE WHOLE COUNTRY ITS FIRM DECISION TO CONDUCT ALL THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE LIGHT OF DAY BEFORE THE PEOPLE AND WILL PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE FULL PUBLICATION OF ALL SECRET TREATIES CONFIRMED OR CONCLUDED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LAND-OWNERS AND CAPITALISTS FROM MARCH UNTIL NOVEMBER 7TH 1917
NEVER YET HE SAID WAS THE FATE OF THE REVOLUTION SO ACUTE NEVER YET DID THE QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RUSSIAN STATE EXCITE SO MUCH ANXIETY NEVER YET DID HISTORY PUT SO HARSHLY AND CATEGORICALLY THE QUESTION--IS RUSSIA TO BE OR NOT TO BE
WHEN KRYLENKO STAGGERING WITH FATIGUE CLIMBED TO THE TRIBUNE WITH A TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND
THE SUPPRESSION OF THE BOURGEOIS PRESS WAS DICTATED NOT ONLY BY PURELY MILITARY NEEDS IN THE COURSE OF THE INSURRECTION AND FOR THE CHECKING OF COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ACTION BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY AS A MEASURE OF TRANSITION TOWARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW REGIME WITH REGARD TO THE PRESS--A REGIME UNDER WHICH THE CAPITALIST OWNERS OF PRINTING-PRESSES AND OF PAPER CANNOT BE THE ALL-POWERFUL AND EXCLUSIVE MANUFACTURERS OF PUBLIC OPINION
PEACE AT RUSSIA'S EXPENSE THE RIBOT REVELATIONS OF AUSTRIA'S PEACE-OFFER TO FRANCE
IS IT CONSTANTINOPLE OR IS IT FREE RUSSIA
TO THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
WE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN ORDER TO COORDINATE OUR ACTIONS
OUR BRANCH HAS DEMANDED AN ALL-RUSSIAN CONVENTION AND THEY REFUSE TO CALL IT THE SAME SITUATION AS IN THE SOVIETS THE ARMY COMMITTEES
THE DRAMA OF REVOLUTION HAS TWO ACTS
ALL TALKING AT ONCE THE COMMITTEE EXPLAINED THAT STEALING WAS NOT WORTHY OF THE PEOPLE'S CHAMPIONS
EVEN GRANTING THE FACT IT WAS PROBABLY DONE BY SOME UNAUTHORISED INDIVIDUAL IN THE EMERGENCY
ON THE 23RD OF OCTOBER OCCURRED THE NAVAL BATTLE WITH A GERMAN SQUADRON IN THE GULF OF RIGA
THE CITY DUMA WAS ALL BRIGHTLY LIGHTED
THE COSSACK GOVERNMENT AT NOVOTCHERKASK TELEGRAPHED TO KERENSKY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COSSACK TROOPS INVITES THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC TO COME IF POSSIBLE TO NOVOTCHERKASK WHERE WE CAN ORGANISE IN COMMON THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI IN FINLAND ALSO THINGS WERE STIRRING
SEICHASS IN A MINUTE
WELL PERHAPS THE BOLSHEVIKI CAN SEIZE THE POWER BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD IT MORE THAN THREE DAYS
WHICH SIDE THEY'LL FIGHT ON OH NO
THE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK HAD REFUSED TO WORK UNDER COMMISSARS FROM SMOLNY REFUSED TO PAY OUT MONEY TO THEM
THE AGENTS OF THE NOTORIOUS OKHRANA STILL FUNCTIONED FOR AND AGAINST THE TSAR FOR AND AGAINST KERENSKY--WHOEVER WOULD PAY
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK OF SUPPLYING THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE WITH BREAD TO OUR LAST EFFORTS SO LONG AS YOU WILL NOT PREVENT US FROM ACCOMPLISHING OUR DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY
KORNILOV'S FAITHFUL TEKHINTSI_[14 HAD SLAUGHTERED HIS GUARDS AT BYKHOV AND HE HAD ESCAPED
FROM TIME TO TIME MEN CAME IN YELLING FOR THE MEMBERS OF SUCH AND SUCH A DETACHMENT TO GO TO THE FRONT
FIVE MEMBERS--NOGIN RYKOV MILIUTIN TEODOROVITCH AND SHIAPNIKOV--RESIGNED FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS DECLARING
BEFORE WE REACHED MOSCOW ALMOST EVERY CAR HAD ORGANISED A COMMITTEE TO SECURE AND DISTRIBUTE FOOD AND THESE COMMITTEES BECAME DIVIDED INTO POLITICAL FACTIONS WHO WRANGLED OVER FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
IT WAS OPPOSED NOT ONLY BY THE GOVERNMENT BUT BY ALL THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS NO MORE
WAIT FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WHICH IS TO MEET IN DECEMBER
THINK OF IT
WORKERS AND SOLDIERS ORGANISATIONS OF THIS KIND ARE MULTIPLYING RAPIDLY
ANOTHER WAS TO VISIT THE BANKS
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY AND WITH THE FARM-ANIMALS
ALSO GUT
WORST OF ALL HOWEVER WAS THE STRIKE IN THE BANKS
AS LONG AS THE DEMOCRACY HAS NOT ORGANISED ITS PRINCIPAL FORCES SO LONG AS THE RESISTANCE TO ITS INFLUENCE IS STILL STRONG THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE IN PASSING TO THE ATTACK
LECTURES DEBATES SPEECHES--IN THEATRES CIRCUSES SCHOOL-HOUSES CLUBS SOVIET MEETING-ROOMS UNION HEADQUARTERS BARRACKS
THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IS SURE THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WILL KNOW HOW TO DEFEND THE REVOLUTION AGAINST ALL ATTACKS OF IMPERIALISM UNTIL THE NEW GOVERNMENT SHALL HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WHICH IT WILL DIRECTLY PROPOSE TO ALL NATIONS
THE PEASANTS CONGRESS
THE PEASANTS CONGRESS
WE OUGHT HE SAID TO CREATE OUR SPECIAL ORGANISATION TO MARCH TO BATTLE AND IF NECESSARY TO DIE IT WAS DECIDED TO SEND TO THE FRONT TWO DELEGATIONS ONE FROM THE SOVIET AND ONE FROM THE GARRISON TO CONFER WITH THE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES AND THE GENERAL STAFF
TIFONOV FOR THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS AT SALONIKA
I RECOGNISED COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV FORMER COMMANDANT OF PETROGRAD FOR WHOSE ARREST THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE PAID A FORTUNE
THE STATE COMMISSION SINCERELY DESIRES THE COLLABORATION OF THIS COMMITTEE
AND THEN WHAT THEN
THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT TO SEIZE THE POWER AGAIN DAN TOOK THE FLOOR VIOLENTLY PROTESTING AGAINST THE ACTION OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHICH HAD SENT A COMMISSAR TO SEIZE THE OFFICE OF IZVIESTIA AND CENSOR THE PAPER
A HUNDRED RESPONDED SAILORS SOLDIERS WORKERS
MOST OF THE COSSACKS ARE TAINTED BY BOLSHEVIK PROPAGANDA THANKS TO THE STRANGE POLICY OF GENERAL DUTOV WHO ALLOWED TO PASS THE MOMENT WHEN BY DECISIVE ACTION SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED
THE USUAL STREET-CARS CRAWLED PAST CITIZENS AND SOLDIERS CLINGING TO THE OUTSIDE IN A WAY TO MAKE THEODORE P
ONE MEMBER SHAKING HIS FIST MOVED TO CUT OFF THE FOOD OF THE CITY IF THE BOLSHEVIKI DARED TO INTERFERE WITH THE SUPPLY COMMITTEES
LET US FORGET EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT THERE IS NO WAY OUT BUT BY THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT--EITHER THAT OR THE DICTATORSHIP OF KORNILOV
AMERICANS
MANDELBAUM TO REGIMENTAL AND FLEET COMMITTEES IN THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 7-8 IN THE WINTER PALACE WHICH IS THE INALIENABLE PROPERTY OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE VALUABLE OBJECTS OF ART WERE STOLEN
MOST OF THE FIRST DAY WAS TAKEN UP BY A VIOLENT DEBATE AS TO WHETHER THE REPRESENTATIVES OF VOLOST SOVIETS SHOULD BE SEATED OR ONLY DELEGATES FROM THE PROVINCIAL BODIES
MANY WRITERS EXPLAIN THEIR HOSTILITY TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT BY ARGUING THAT THE LAST PHASE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WAS SIMPLY A STRUGGLE OF THE RESPECTABLE ELEMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTAL ATTACKS OF BOLSHEVISM
BEFORE EACH EMPTY SEAT WAS PEN AND INK AND PAPER
ZARUDNY
FROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMA THE MUNICIPAL DUMA IN ITS MEETING OF OCTOBER 26TH IN VIEW OF THE EVENTS OF THE DAY DECREES
THE GARRISON OF PETROGRAD CANNOT REMAIN INDIFFERENT WHEN CITIZENS BUYING THE GOLOS SOLDATA AND NEWSBOYS SELLING THE RABOTCHAYA GAZETA ARE ARRESTED IN THE STREETS
COMRADES YELLED ONE OF MY GUARDS
THE TROOPS MUST TAKE ALL MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITIONS OCCUPIED BY THEM ARRANGING TRENCHES AND OTHER DEFENSIVE WORKS
YES THE BOLSHEVIK MEMBER OF THE DUMA
THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOVIET LEADERS ABROAD IS NOT UNIMPORTANT
ATAMAN KALEDIN PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COSSACK TROOPS PRIKAZ OF THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT KERENSKY DATED AT GATCHINA
FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE NEW REGIME IN SPITE OF THE CONFUSION INCIDENT UPON A GREAT REVOLUTION WHEN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLIONS OF THE WORLD'S MOST OPPRESSED PEOPLES SUDDENLY ACHIEVED LIBERTY BOTH THE INTERNAL SITUATION AND THE COMBATIVE POWER OF THE ARMY ACTUALLY IMPROVED
ALL HIS MILITARY EQUIPMENT A COSSACK HAD TO PROVIDE WITH HIS OWN HARDLY EARNED MEANS
SINCE THE DEPARTURE OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THERE IS NOT A LEGAL QUORUM
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BATTALION COMMITTEE
WHEN THE DOWN-TRODDEN MASSES REVOLT IT IS THEIR RIGHT THEN THE LONG-FACED CRUEL-TONGUED LIEBER GREETED WITH GROANS AND LAUGHTER
THE IZVOSHTCHIKI CAB-DRIVERS HAD A UNION
MANY WERE KILLED BUT THE REST DASHED BACKWARD AND FORWARD LAUGHING DARING EACH OTHER
IT'S ONLY A FEW HOURS MORE NOW
THE DISORGANISATION IS GROWING WITH EVERY HOURS
BY AN IMMENSE MAJORITY IT RESOLVED THAT ALL POWER SHOULD BE ASSUMED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS
BESIDES THE TWO PARTY PAPERS RABOTCHI PUT AND SOLDAT SOLDIER THERE APPEARED A NEW PAPER FOR THE PEASANTS DEREVENSKAYA BYEDNOTA VILLAGE POOREST POURED OUT IN A DAILY HALF-MILLION EDITION

FOR THESE REASONS THE PEASANTS CONGRESS SUSTAINS ENTIRELY THE REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER 7TH
AT MIDNIGHT NOVEMBER 5TH KERENSKY HIMSELF SENT MALEVSKY TO OFFER THE PETROGRAD SOVIET REPRESENTATION ON THE STAFF
2 FOR TURKISH ARMENIA AUTONOMY AND LATER COMPLETE SELF-DETERMINATION AS SOON AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED
TWO MEN TOOK AWAY THE BRONZE CLOCK
KOLCHINSKY FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES OUTLINED THE HISTORY OF THE LAND QUESTION DURING THE REVOLUTION
THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS OVER
I LEFT THE CONGRESS WITH MY PARTY WEDNESDAY NIGHT
BUT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FOUND ITSELF UNABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE ITS ACCUSATIONS
IN TASHKENT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES SUPPRESSED THE SOVIET
THERE WAS STILL A GREAT DEAL OF COMING AND GOING OF EXPLORING NEW-FOUND APARTMENTS IN THE VAST EDIFICE OF SEARCHING FOR HIDDEN GARRISONS OF YUNKERS WHICH DID NOT EXIST
BUT THAT AT PRESENT MOST OF THEM WERE AT LEVASHOVO AND THE REST SCATTERED ABOUT THE CITY IN PRIVATE HOUSES
INSIDE A GREAT HALL HUNG WITH BUNTING AND EVERGREENS ROWS OF CHAIRS A STAGE BEING BUILT
NIET SAID HE THERE ARE DEVILS IT WAS ONLY AFTER WEARY WANDERING THAT WE FOUND A DRIVER WILLING TO TAKE US--AND HE WANTED THIRTY RUBLES AND STOPPED TWO BLOCKS AWAY
ABOUT THOSE PASSES OF YOURS HE WENT ON
HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY BUT I TELL YOU NOW THAT IF YOU ALLOW THE SOVIETS TO BE DESTROYED WE'RE THROUGH WITH YOU SOME SOLDIERS JOINED HIM
DA ZDRAVSTVUYET THE PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP OF ALL LANDS SUCH A DELUGE OF HIGH AND HOT THOUGHTS THAT SURELY RUSSIA WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE DUMB
I SPEAK FOR THE DELEGATES FROM THE FRONT
KERENSKY GAVE THEM TEN MINUTES IN WHICH TO OBEY
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NATION'S GREATEST MISFORTUNES THESE CRIMINAL SPOLIATORS ARE PLAYING WITH THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF MILLIONS OF SOLDIERS AND WORKERS FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT
THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN CAPITALISTS IN RUSSIA SET IN MOTION THIS VERY SAME SCHEME
WE WENT ON THROUGH THE ARCH OF THE HUGE EKATERINA PALACE INTO THE PALACE ENCLOSURE ITSELF ASKING FOR HEADQUARTERS
THERE WAS A SOUND OF SCUFFLING
WE OH I KNOW THAT SILLY TALK BROKE IN THE STUDENT RUDELY
THIS PROPAGANDA MUST BE EXTIRPATED AT ITS ROOTS
FOR EIGHT MONTHS THEY HAD BEEN GOVERNING THEMSELVES BY COMMITTEE AND THIS SMACKED OF THE OLD REGIME
THE LITTLE NICOLAI PALACE A BUILDING OF NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE WHICH WAS OCCUPIED OCCASIONALLY BY RECEPTIONS OF ONE OF THE GRAND DUCHESSES HAD SERVED AS BARRACKS FOR THE YUNKERS IT WAS NOT ONLY BOMBARDED BUT PRETTY WELL SACKED
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL US OFFICIALLY THE RESULT OF YOUR INVESTIGATIONS HE TURNED TO US HIS FACE OF VENERABLE DIGNITY
EVEN BURTZEV IS SHUT UP IN PETER-PAUL FORTRESS UNDER STRICT GUARD
BERCHIKOV THESE MEN WERE DRAFTED INTO THE ARMY ON NOVEMBER 15TH 1916
LENIN'S ARGUMENT WAS SIMPLE
ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE GROUPED AROUND THE PLATFORM WHERE SKOBELIEV WAS SPEAKING
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THE PRISONERS IN PETER PAUL ARE IN DANGER
ON THE SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT SIX THOUSAND YUNKERS TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED COSSACKS AND TWO THOUSAND WHITE GUARDS
WHY ONLY TO-DAY LENIN SENT WORD THAT HE WOULD NOT OBJECT TO TCHERNOV ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT
THE REST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED WERE TAKEN TO PETER-PAUL UNDER ESCORT IN SMALL GROUPS SO AS TO AVOID NOTICE
THE KERENSKY GOVERNMENT IS AGAINST THE PEOPLE
ALL QUESTIONS OF COMPENSATION FOR THE ABOVE ARE WITHIN THE COMPETENCE OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THEY SHUT ME UP IN THE CELLAR AND SWIPED MY OVERCOAT MY MONEY WATCH AND EVEN THE RING ON MY FINGER
ON A BOLSHEVIK'S WORD OF HONOUR PEACE HAS BEEN SIGNED
THE ATTITUDE OF SOCIALISTS ON THE QUESTION OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE FREEDOM OF BUSINESS
THEY TRICKED US--THE KERENSKYS AND AVKSENTIEVS
TOO LATE
THE KORNILOVISTS OF THE STAFF ARE TRYING TO DRAW IN FROM THE SUBURBS YUNKERS AND VOLUNTEER BATTALIONS
WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT HERE IS THE CRITICISM THE CREATIVENESS OF THE MASSES THEMSELVES
THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESSES OF SOLDIERS WORKERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES HAVE PASSED A RESOLUTION TO TRANSFER ALL LANDOWNERS LAND INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE TOILING PEOPLE
WHAT IS IT THE OTHERS HELD BACK WAITING
SHLIAPNIKOV TRIED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR
CHAPTER 1
THAT WOULD BE A FLIGHT
WE MUST SAVE OUR COUNTRY SAVE FREEDOM
THEY DEMANDED TO BE SENT BACK TO RUSSIA WHICH WAS REFUSED
THE COMMANDANT WAS NOT IN
THIS WAS FATHER IVAN THEY SAID WHO HAD BLESSED THE COSSACKS WHEN THEY ENTERED THE TOWN
THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY FORCED HIM AGAIN TO GO FORWARD INTO GALICIA TO SLAUGHTER AND BE SLAUGHTERED
WOULD THE PEOPLES ANSWER AND RISE A RED WORLD-TIDE
AS THE REVOLUTION BECAME MORE AND MORE A SOCIAL ECONOMIC REVOLUTION THE CADETS GREW MORE AND MORE CONSERVATIVE
| 1900 | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | CASTOR | ARSHIN | 6

IN VIEW OF THIS THE MEETING RESOLVES
APPEALS TO THE FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN
ALL FACTIONS EXCEPT A HANDFUL OF BOLSHEVIKI HAVE LEFT THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
IN FIXING THE DURATION OF THE ARMISTICE AT THREE MONTHS WE DESIRE TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLES AS LONG A REST AS POSSIBLE AFTER THIS BLOODY EXTERMINATION AND AMPLE TIME FOR THEM TO ELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
THE TOWN OF GATCHINA HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE LOYAL REGIMENTS WITHOUT BLOODSHED
EVEN THE BRANCHES OF THE RAILWAYMEN'S UNION HAD VOTED AGAINST SUCH A PROPOSITION
WE COULD SEE THEM IN THE HALL AND HEAR THEIR LOW VEHEMENT VOICES
THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY CEASES TO EXIST
GAMBLING CLUBS FUNCTIONED HECTICALLY FROM DUSK TO DAWN WITH CHAMPAGNE FLOWING AND STAKES OF TWENTY THOUSAND RUBLES
THE PETROGRAD GARRISON NUMBERED ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND MEN WHO HAD TAKEN A PROMINENT PART IN THE REVOLUTION

ON EACH SIDE OF US WERE CHURCHES MONASTERIES
APPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE NOVEMBER 8
ON THE 19TH THE CONFERENCE TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT DISBANDED AND THE OPPOSITION ONE BY ONE SLIPPED AWAY TO MOGHILEV WHERE UNDER THE WING OF THE GENERAL STAFF THEY CONTINUED TO FORM GOVERNMENT AFTER GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE END
THEREFORE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE BATTLE I WILL GIVE YOU AN ORDER FOR ROOMS IN THE OFFICERS HOTEL AND IF YOU WILL COME BACK HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WILL GIVE YOU NEW PASSES SO YOU ARE FOR KERENSKY WE SAID
NO ONE SPOKE
SEVERAL DID NOT COME BACK
THEY TELL YOU THAT THE SOVIETS WISH TO CONFISCATE THE LANDS OF THE COSSACKS
IMMEDIATELY THE POOR OF THE GREAT CITIES THE INMATES OF INSTITUTIONS WERE PLUNGED IN MISERABLE WANT
THEY TELL US THAT THEIR OBJECTS ARE GOOD
WHEN TYRANNY FALLS THE PEOPLE WILL RISE GREAT AND FREE
KRYLENKO
KRYLENKO
THEY KEPT SHOUTING KHANJUNOV
THE CONFERENCE
SUDDENLY TCHERNOV APPEARED AND DEMANDED THE FLOOR
THE IRON SHUTTERS OF THE SHOPS WERE DRAWN BUT BUSINESS STILL WENT ON
AND THE WORLD--WHAT OF IT
JUST THE OPPOSITE
MORE AND MORE SOLDIERS WITH THE RED SHOULDER-STRAPS OF THE YUNKER_-SCHOOLS MOVED ABOUT IN A STALE ATMOSPHERE OF TOBACCO-SMOKE AND UNWASHED HUMANITY
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RETIRED AT A PRUDENT HOUR GOT UP EARLY AND WENT TO WORK
I SAY COUNT ON THAT REVOLUTIONARY DETERMINATION BUT DON'T FORGET YOUR GUN LENIN THEN READ THE BOLSHEVIK RESOLUTION
AS THEY WENT DOWN THE SUVOROVSKY PROSPECT SOME ONE MENTIONED FOOD
KERENSKY AT THE DEMAND OF THE ARISTOCRAT PROPRIETORS THE CAPITALISTS SPECULATORS MARCHES AGAINST YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING BACK THE LAND TO THE LAND-OWNERS AND CONTINUING THE HATED AND RUINOUS WAR
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT IS TAKING EVERY MEASURE TO ASSURE THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD THAT IS SAID BY OUR COMMON ENEMIES THE LAND-OWNERS AND THE CAPITALISTS
SUDDENLY IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT ON THE SAME DAY THE COSSACKS WOULD HOLD A KRESTNY KHOD_--PROCESSION OF THE CROSS--IN HONOUR OF THE IKON OF 1612 THROUGH WHOSE MIRACULOUS INTERVENTION NAPOLEON HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM MOSCOW
AS WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS RIAZANOV BURST IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR VERY AGITATED
UNDER KERENSKY HE FOUND HIS COMMITTEES SUPPRESSED HIS NEWSPAPERS CUT OFF HIS PARTY SPEAKERS PUT IN PRISON
THE GOVERNMENT TORN BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC AND REACTIONARY FACTIONS COULD DO NOTHING
KERENSKY IS RETREATING WE ARE ADVANCING
PRESERVING THE CONTINUITY OF THE ONLY LEGAL GOVERNMENTAL POWER THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION ESTABLISHED ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 7TH TAKES THE INITIATIVE IN FORMING A NEW PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE BOLSHEVIKI MUST BE MERCILESSLY CRUSHED SKOBELIEV WAS IN FAVOR OF EXCLUDING BOTH THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE CADETS
IT IS ORDERED TO ALL PRODUCERS OF ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLIC DRINKS TO INFORM NOT LATER THAN ON THE 27TH INST
BUT WE MUST HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED DEMOCRACY OR RUSSIA IS LOST
AVKSENTIEV THE LEAN RED-BEARDED PRESIDENT OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS SAROKIN KERENSKY'S SPOKESMAN KHINTCHUK ABRAMOVITCH
IN WHICH CASE IT IS TO BE REGARDED IN EVERY LOCALITY AS BECOMING LAW UPON THE PUBLICATION OF THE TELEGRAM
THE WRITING WAS BLURRED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE TEARS
THE WORK OF THE STATE COMMISSION SERVES AS A LINK AND HELPMATE TO ORGANISE RESOURCES OF MATERIAL AND MORAL SUPPORT TO THE MUNICIPAL AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WITH A CLASS-CHARACTER ESTABLISHED BY THE WORKERS
THE PEASANTS CONGRESS FULLY SUPPORTING THE LAND DECREE OF NOVEMBER 8TH
FOR THIRTY-SIX HOURS NOW THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD BEEN CUT OFF FROM PROVINCIAL RUSSIA AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD
THE RESOLUTION OF LARIN AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WAS DEFEATED BY 31 TO 22
AND OTHERS GREYFACED AND MUDDY COMING BACK
WE FORCED OUR WAY THROUGH THE DENSE MASS PACKED NEAR THE KREMLIN WALL AND STOOD UPON ONE OF THE DIRT-MOUNTAINS
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I WANT PEACE
I WISH YOU WELL COMRADES AND CITIZENS HE SAID
ON ALL QUESTIONS RELATING TO WORKERS CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EMPLOYMENT THE TRADE UNIONS MUST CONFER WITH THE WORKERS OF INDIVIDUAL ESTABLISHMENTS THROUGH THEIR FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES
KERENSKY WAS ADVANCING NORTH FROM GATCHINA THE BOLSHEVIK GARRISONS FALLING BACK BEFORE HIM
THEY EITHER WORKED UNDERGROUND OR THEIR MEMBERS JOINED THE CADETS AS THE CADETS CAME BY DEGREES TO STAND FOR THEIR POLITICAL PROGRAMME
AND IN SOME CASES MEN WHO RETURNED FROM ABROAD TO THEIR VILLAGES WERE PROSECUTED AND IMPRISONED FOR REVOLUTIONARY ACTS COMMITTED IN 1905
BACK ALONG THE FLAT HORIZON THE GLOW OF THE CITY'S LIGHTS FADED DOWN THE NIGHT
BUT AT THE APPROACH OF KERENSKY AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION THE RIGHT WING OF THE MENSHEVIKI SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND POPULIST SOCIALISTS SUDDENLY WITHDREW
IT IS ACCEPTED AS A NATURAL PART OF THE GENERAL POLICY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CONSPIRACY
AT THE CORNER OF THE MORSKAYA AND THE NEVSKY SQUADS OF SOLDIERS WITH FIXED BAYONETS WERE STOPPING ALL PRIVATE AUTOMOBILES TURNING OUT THE OCCUPANTS AND ORDERING THEM TOWARD THE WINTER PALACE
THEN WE TURNED AROUND AND TOOK AWAY THE YUNKERS GUNS JUST THEN THE COMMANDANT ENTERED--A MERRY-LOOKING YOUNG NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER WITH HIS ARM IN A SLING AND DEEP CIRCLES OF SLEEPLESSNESS UNDER HIS EYES
WE ARE HOLDING THE CITY FOR KERENSKY OUR HEARTS SANK FOR OUR PASSES STATED THAT WE WERE REVOLUTIONARY TO THE CORE
| 3.50--6
ONE OF THE LOWER TOWERS HAD LOST ITS BRICK SPIRE
THE QUESTION OF DETAILED PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTING THE LAND AND THE QUESTION OF WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY WERE POSTPONED UNTIL THE EXPERTS WORKING ON THEM SHOULD SUBMIT A REPORT
AT PULKOVO HEAVY FIGHTING IS GOING ON
I MINISTER-PRESIDENT OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPREME COMMANDER OF ALL THE ARMED FORCES OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC DECLARE THAT I AM AT THE HEAD OF REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONT WHO HAVE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO THE FATHERLAND
FOUR HUNDRED CONSTITUTED A QUORUM AND THE CONGRESS WAS ONLY THREE DAYS OFF

THE TROOPS OF KERENSKY NOT TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT OR ARREST A SINGLE MAN
AVILOV OF THE STAFF OF NOVAYA ZHIZN WAS SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT INTERNATIONALISTS AND THE REMNANT OF THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS
THE NEXT MORNING EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF THE LOCAL SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPULIES WITH PARTICIPATION OF COSSACK DELEGATES--THERE BEING 6,000 COSSACKS AT OSTROV
IT IS A PROVOCATZIA SAID HE
INSIDE ALL WAS UPROAR SOLDIERS RUNNING HERE AND THERE GRABBING UP GUNS RIFLE-BELTS AND SHOUTING HERE THEY COME
YOU AMERICANS ARE BORN POLITICIANS
OLD RUSSIA WAS RAPIDLY BREAKING UP
3 ARMY AFTER ARMY FLEET AFTER FLEET SENT DEPUTATIONS JOYFULLY TO GREET THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF SMOLNY ONE DAY I SAW A RAGGED REGIMENT JUST COME FROM THE TRENCHES

APPENDICES I
THE SESSIONS OF THE CONGRESS HAD NOW BEEN REMOVED TO THE IMPERIAL LAW SCHOOL BUILDING FONTANKA 6 HEADQUARTERS OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS
AT THAT TIME IT STOOD FOR THE ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND ONLY THE OWNERS TO BE COMPENSATED IN SOME FASHION
BOLSHEVIK GENDARMES
WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER EVEN THE BOURGEOIS PRESS WAS UNEASY
NOW FROM THE FAR QUARTERS OF THE CITY THE WORKERS OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORIES WERE ARRIVING WITH THEIR DEAD
ALONG THE SIDEWALK A ROW OF DESERTERS IN UNIFORM SOLD CIGARETTES AND SUNFLOWER SEEDS
3 WILL THEY ACCEPT THE LAND AND PEACE DECREES
THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH HAD FINALLY DECIDED TO WELCOME THE DELEGATES TO THAT NEW CONGRESS WHICH WOULD MEAN ITS OWN RUIN--AND PERHAPS THE RUIN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ORDER IT HAD BUILT

LISTEN MARAT RECOMMENCES TROTZKY AFTER A MOMENT
THE RECENT EVENTS SAID THE ORATOR DO NOT INDICATE A SIMPLE RIOT OR A BOLSHEVIK ADVENTURE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A REAL POPULAR RISING WHICH HAS BEEN GREETED WITH SYMPATHY BY THE WHOLE COUNTRY
AND IT IS OUR PARTY'S HONOUR TO HAVE REALISED THAT COALITION
BY THIS MEANS AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES WERE CONVEYED TO THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
FELL A TENSE HUSH
THE SOLDIER MASSES NO LONGER TRUST THEIR OFFICERS
AT PRESENT IT IS NOTHING BUT A DICTATORSHIP OF THE WORKERS
THE GOVERNMENT CAN SURRENDER ITS AUTHORITY ONLY TO THE CONSITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE COSSACKS RETREATED TOWARDS GATCHINA AND COLPINNO
FLEET COMMITTEES THE CORRESPONDING ORGANISATIONS IN THE NAVY
WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS YES THEY CRIED WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS SPEAK
WHAT IS GOING ON IN THERE ASKED THE SAILOR POINTING TO THE BUILDING
A DEPUTATION WAS SENT TO THE REBELS
AT NUMBER 86 NEVSKY WE WENT THROUGH A PASSAGE INTO A COURTYARD SURROUNDED BY TALL APARTMENT BUILDINGS
THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE DIVIDED
HE HAS HIM
THEY HAVE GOT ARTILLERY BEHIND THE WOOD-PILES IN THERE HERE THE STREET-CARS HAD STOPPED RUNNING FEW PEOPLE PASSED AND THERE WERE NO LIGHTS
FIVE KOPEKS PAID FOR TEA IN A TIN CUP
AND IN THESE TERRIBLE CRITICAL DAYS RUMOURS CREEP ABOUT THAT SOMEWHERE A DEMONSTRATION IS BEING PREPARED THAT SOME ONE IS CALLING ON THE SOLDIERS AND WORKERS TO DESTROY REVOLUTIONARY PEACE AND ORDER
BUT IT WAS DONE BY HIS SECRETARY DR DAVID SOSKICE--AND THUS PURGED OF ALL OFFENSIVE REFERENCES TO THE ALLIES WAS GIVEN TO THE PRESS OF THE WORLD
THE MUD WAS GONE
THEY HAD ARTILLERY
IT WAS GETTING LATE WHEN WE LEFT THE PALACE
SCATTERED RIFLE-FIRE SUMMONS TO SURRENDER
HOWEVER WE SHALL NOT PERMIT THEM UNDER THE PRETENCE OF FREEDOM OF THE SOCIALIST PRESS TO OBTAIN THROUGH THE SECRET SUPPORT OF THE BOURGEOISIE A MONOPOLY OF PRINTING-PRESSES INK AND PAPER
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PROLETARIAN ANYWHERE IN SIGHT
IS IT THE DEMOCRACY OR IS IT THE CAPITALIST PLUNDERERS
UNDER THE EARTH OF THE GRAVE YOU HAVE STRAITLY CLOSED YOUR RANKS
ALL RUSSIA WAS LEARNING TO READ AND READING_--POLITICS ECONOMICS HISTORY--BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW IN EVERY CITY IN MOST TOWNS ALONG THE FRONT EACH POLITICAL FACTION HAD ITS NEWSPAPER--SOMETIMES SEVERAL
A WHOLE CROP OF NEW APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION HAD BLOSSOMED OUT ON THE WALLS DURING THE NIGHT--TO THE PEASANTS TO THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT TO THE WORKMEN OF PETROGRAD
BUT IN SPITE OF THE IMPERATIVE DECISION OF THE FIRST PEASANT CONGRESS THE REACTIONARIES AND CONCILIATORS IN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD PREVENTED ANY ACTION
INDEMNITIES AND CONTRIBUTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE WAR MUST BE REFUNDED
FROM NOW ON THERE MUST BE IN RUSSIA NO RULERS OR FUNCTIONARIES WHO COMMAND THE PEOPLE FROM ABOVE AND DRIVE THEM
THE GOVERNMENTAL POWER IS VESTED IN A COLLEGIUM MADE UP OF THE CHAIRMEN OF THESE COMMISSIONS THAT IS TO SAY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS

THE POLISH CHIEF MILITARY COMMITTEE SWIFTLY GATHERED TOGETHER THE POLISH TROOPS IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY ABOLISHED THEIR COMMITTEES AND ESTABLISHED AN IRON DISCIPLINE
LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION AN UPROAR FOLLOWED IN WHICH THE BOLSHEVIKI AND SOME OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE ON THEIR FEET ALL AT ONCE SHAKING THEIR FISTS AND YELLING AND THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLY TRIED TO YELL THEM DOWN
AND THAT IS OUR PRINCIPAL DUTY AT THIS MOMENT
SHLIAPNIKOV AND TEODOROVITCH SUBMITTED TO PARTY DISCIPLINE AND RETURNED TO THEIR POSTS
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THE CANNON LEAPED FROM ONE WHEEL TO THE OTHER AND THE GRUBIT BOMBS WENT ROLLING BACK AND FORTH OVER OUR FEET FETCHING UP AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE CAR WITH A CRASH
BUT THE DUMA HAD FORCED HIM
TO HELL WITH KERENSKY
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XI 1
WITH A PITEOUS GLANCE AT US THE COLONEL WAS LED AWAY
GENERAL DUKHONIN FOR HAVING REFUSED TO OBEY ORDERS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HAS BEEN DISMISSED FROM HIS POSITION AS SUPREME COMMANDER
THE LAND CAN BE TAKEN OVER IN AN ORGANISED MANNER
TOWARD MORNING THE MILITARY HOTEL WAS TAKEN AND AT 5 O'CLOCK THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
WE UNLOCKED THE DOOR

1 ALL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF LAND IS ABOLISHED IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT COMPENSATION
GATCHINA NOVEMBER 14 1917
HE IS NOT TO BLAME
LENIN AND TROTZKY WERE TO BE ELIMINATED AND THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND OTHER REPRESSIVE ORGANS DISSOLVED
BUT IN ANY CASE FROM THIS TRIBUNE IN FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY RESPONSIBILITY I QUALITY SUCH ACTS OF A RUSSIAN POLITICAL PARTY AS ACTS OF TREASON TO RUSSIA
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TASY-EE-KAH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES DECLARED DEFINITELY THAT THEY STAND FOR A GOVERNMENT OF THE SOVIETS FOR THE DECREES ON LAND PEACE AND WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY AND THAT UPON THIS PLATFORM THEY ARE WILLING TO AGREE WITH ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES
KERENSKY IS SMASHED
IT WILL NOT BE OUR FAULT IF THERE IS FAMINE IN THE TOWN
MEN WERE TOSSING BUNDLES INTO IT AND OTHERS RECEIVING THEM WITH GUNS BESIDE THEM
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I AM A SOLDIER
1435 CERTIFICATE THE PRESENT CERTIFICATE IS GIVEN TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY THE INTERNATIONALIST COMRADE JOHN REED
THE CADETS THINK THEY ARE USING US
THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE LED BY GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN OFFICERS HE AFFIRMED
WORKMEN AND SOLDIERS STAGGERED PAST CARRYING THEM TO WAITING AUTOMOBILES
NOW THERE WAS ALL GREAT RUSSIA TO WIN--AND THEN THE WORLD
I WENT BACK TO PETROGRAD RIDING ON THE FRONT SEAT OF AN AUTO TRUCK DRIVEN BY A WORKMAN AND FILLED WITH RED GUARDS
WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF THE VIKZHEL TO FORM A HOMOGENEOUS SOCIALIST MINISTRY AND THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT NOW
WE PAID NO ATTENTION
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA TO BE AUTONOMOUS
THERE IS NO MORE SUPERB OR BEAUTIFUL PHENOMENON THAN THE ONE OF WHICH OUR NEAREST DESCENDANTS WILL BE BOTH WITNESSES AND PARTICIPANTS
AND BESIDES WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE I SOLEMNLY AFFIRMED THAT THE CONSUL HAD FORBIDDEN ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS TO CARRY ARMS--ESPECIALLY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTZIA
THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS NEEDED THE BOURGEOISIE
BEAT THE JEWS BEAT THE SHOPKEEPERS ROB THE MARKETS DEVASTATE THE SHOPS PILLAGE THE WINE STORES
HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVILS THE CAPTAIN SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
UNDER DULL GREY SKIES IN THE SHORTENING DAYS THE RAIN FELL DRENCHING INCESSANT
WAR BY STRIKE AND SABOTAGE
BREAD
THE ORGANISATION OF PATROLS IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE DISTRICT COMMANDER AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CITY MILITIA AND THE TAKING OF MEASURES FOR THE ARREST OF CRIMINALS AND DESERTERS
ALL OBSTACLES TO THE STOCKHOLM SOCIALIST CONFERENCE ARE TO BE REMOVED AND PASSPORTS ARE TO BE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY TO ALL DELEGATES OF PARTIES AND ORGANISATIONS WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE
AS THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT GREW WEAKER THESE CENTRAL COMMITTEES WERE FORCED TO ASSUME MORE AND MORE ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS
THEY ARE JUST SO MUCH REFUSE WHICH WILL BE SWEPT INTO THE GARBAGE-HEAP OF HISTORY RIAZANOV FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI STATED THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY DUMA THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAD SENT A DELEGATION TO OFFER NEGOTIATIONS TO THE WINTER PALACE
WHAT WE NEED IS A REALLY DECISIVE VICTORY
SUNDAY NOVEMBER 4TH WAS DESIGNATED AS THE DAY OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WITH IMMENSE MEETINGS PLANNED ALL OVER THE CITY OSTENSIBLY TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE ORGANISATION AND THE PRESS
HE WAS A SULLEN YOUTH WITH THE SHOULDER-STRAPS OF A LIEUTENANT
AND IN THE RAIN THE BITTER CHILL THE GREAT THROBBING CITY UNDER GREY SKIES RUSHING FASTER AND FASTER TOWARD--WHAT
THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT SHOT A SQUAT FLAT-FACED MAN IN A UNIFORM WITHOUT INSIGNIA WHO SEEMED TO BE SMILING--WHICH SMILE AFTER A MINUTE ONE SAW TO BE THE FIXED GRIN OF EXTREME FATIGUE
THEY WERE CONTROLLED BY THE PROPERTIED CLASSES AND THEY FEARED AND DETESTED BOLSHEVISM
THE MOST IMPORTANT ART TREASURES OF THE PALACE--PAINTINGS STATUES TAPESTRIES RARE PORCELAINS AND ARMORIE,--HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO MOSCOW DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER
THESE LAND COMMITTEES ARE NOT ATTEMPTING THE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION OF THE LAND QUESTION WHICH BELONGS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ALONE
THE LANDLORDS AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MASSACRE THEM WITH PUNITIVE EXPEDITIONS
PURISHKEVITCH'S LETTER TO KALEDIN THE SITUATION AT PETROGRAD IS DESPERATE
REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS HAD CUT THE RAILWAY LINE TO PREVENT TROOPS BEING SENT AGAINST THE CAPITAL
WE DON'T NEED ANY PASSES THE COMRADES DON'T KNOW YOU AT THIS THERE WAS A DEBATE
DO NOT OBEY ITS ORDERS
ORDERLIES WERE DEFTLY SERVING DINNER
NOT A HOLD-UP NOT A ROBBERY NOT EVEN A DRUNKEN FIGHT
THAT CHIEF OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CAMPAIGN HAS FLED
KERENSKY IS COMING
RAISING HIS VOICE TO A SHOUT HE READ THE MENSHEVIK DECLARATION
A COMMISSAR CAME THIS MORNING BUT HE RETURNED TO PETROGRAD WHEN THE COSSACKS ARRIVED THE COSSACKS ARE HERE THEN HE NODDED GLOOMILY
THE BOLSHEVIKI YIELDED BUT AS THEY LEFT THE BUILDING COSSACKS ATTACKED THEM CRYING THIS IS WHAT WE'LL DO TO ALL THE OTHER BOLSHEVIK SOVIETS INCLUDING THOSE OF MOSCOW AND PETROGRAD THIS INCIDENT SENT A WAVE OF PANIC RAGE THROUGHOUT RUSSIA
AND BESIDE IT THE GREAT BARRACKS LIKE FACADE OF SMOLNY INSTITUTE TWO HUNDRED YARDS LONG AND THREE LOFTY STORIES HIGH THE IMPERIAL ARMS CARVED HUGELY IN STONE STILL INSOLENT OVER THE ENTRANCE
BUT I HAVE NOT HAD ANY SLEEP FOR FOUR NIGHTS
THE REMAINDER OF THE BUSINESS BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY WAS HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN OLD NATHANSON THE WHITE-BEARDED DEAN OF THE LEFT WING OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HIS VOICE TREMBLING AND TEARS IN HIS EYES READ THE REPORT OF THE WEDDING OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS WITH THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SOVIETS
THESE CONGRESSES TRANSFERRED ALL THE AUTHORITY IN THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS I.E INTO THE HANDS OF MEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE
THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS AT AN END AND THE TIME IS APPROACHING WHEN THEY MUST RETIRE WITH THE REST OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MACHINERY FROM THE STAGE OF A FREE AND VICTORIOUS PEOPLE WHOSE WEAPONS SHALL HEREAFTER BE THE PEACEFUL ONES OF POLITICAL ACTION THE LEADING ARTICLE OF IZVIESTIA FOR OCTOBER 23D WAS CALLED THE CRISIS IN THE SOVIET ORGANISATIONS IT BEGAN BY SAYING THAT TRAVELLERS REPORTED A LESSENING ACTIVITY OF LOCAL SOVIETS EVERYWHERE
THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND IN RUSSIA IS THE BASIS FOR IMMENSE OPPRESSION AND THE CONFISCATION OF THE LAND BY THE PEASANTS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP OF OUR REVOLUTION
SEE SAID A TALL PEASANT POINTING TO IT
SO CALLED FROM THE INITIALS OF ITS NAME
SO CALLED FROM THE INITIALS OF ITS NAME
13)--THE LAST TIME HE RECEIVED JOURNALISTS
FROM THE ACCOUNTS IN THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE STAVKA OF FORMER SUPREME COMMANDER DUKHONIN ARE GATHERING THE AGENTS AND ALLIES OF THE BOURGEOISIE VERKHOVSKI AVKSENTIEV TCHERNOV GOTZ TSERETELLI ETC
ONLY 18 PER CENT OF THE RETURNS WERE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY AGAINST MORE THAN 70 PER CENT IN JUNE
KORNILOVITZ THE OTHERS CRIED AT HIM GAILY SLAPPING HIM ON THE SHOULDER
BUT WAIT
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WILL BE MERCILESS IN PURSUIT OF SPECULATORS AND MARAUDERS
GORKY POINTED OUT THAT BOTH REACTIONARY AND GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS WERE INCITING THE BOLSHEVIKI TO VIOLENCE
THEY DID NOT CONSPIRE
THE FIGHT AGAINST ILLITERACY AND IGNORANCE CANNOT BE CONFINED TO A THOROUGH ESTABLISHMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTHS
THE PAINTINGS STATUES TAPESTRIES AND RUGS OF THE GREAT STATE APARTMENTS WERE UNHARMED
GREETINGS FROM THE SOVIETS OF TSARITZIN ROVENSKY-ON-DON TCHERNOGORSK SEVASTOPOL
AND WILL THE RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY WHICH HAS INSCRIBED ON ITS BANNER THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS TO DISPOSE OF THEMSELVES ALLOW CALMLY THE CONTINUATION OF OPPRESSION UPON THE MOST CIVILISED PEOPLES IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY
WE ASKED IF WE COULD INTERVIEW THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT
ANY DEMONSTRATION TO DEPOSE THIS POWER BY VIOLENCE AT A MOMENT WHEN A GOVERNMENT CRISIS WILL INFALLIBLY CREATE DISORGANISATION THE RUIN OF THE COUNTRY AND CIVIL WAR WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE ARMY AS A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ACT AND REPRESSED BY FORCE OF ARMS
AGAINST THE OVERWHELMING SENTIMENT OF THE COUNTRY KERENSKY AND THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING A GOVERNMENT OF COALITION WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
ALL NIGHT LONG THE 23D THEY MET
BUT THE LANDOWNERS WHO HAVE THOUSANDS OF DESSIATINS OF THEIR OWN LAND WISH BESIDES TO GET INTO THEIR HANDS THE LANDS OF THE COSSACK ARMY
WE PROTEST MOREOVER AGAINST THE TYRANNICAL CONDUCT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
BETWEEN THE PEASANTS AND AVKSENTIEV WHO ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE LAND COMMITTEES WE CHOOSE THE PEASANTS
I STOOD IN THE DOORWAY AND A SUDDEN SILENCE RAN AMONG THE GROUPS WHO TURNED AND STARED AT ME
SHOOT US IF YOU WANT TO
THESE ARE ALL STUDENTS IN THE OFFICERS TRAINING SCHOOLS
6 THE DISPUTED PROVINCES IN THE BALKANS TO HAVE PROVISIONAL AUTONOMY FOLLOWED BY A PLEBISCITE
ALL THE PERSONS WE HAVE MENTIONED HAVE BEEN MINISTERS ALREADY
WHOEVER CAN GIVE US PEACE WHETHER IT BE THE BOLSHEVIKI OR THIS NEW GOVERNMENT WE WILL FOLLOW
THE MASSES OF THE SOLDIERS WANT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY TO BE HELD EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS CALLED FOR AND THOSE WHO DARE TO POSTPONE IT WILL BE CURSED--AND NOT ONLY PLATONIC CURSES EITHER FOR THE ARMY HAS GUNS TOO HE TOLD OF THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE CONSTITUENT NOW RAGING IN THE FIFTH ARMY
REFUSAL OF INSURRECTION IS REFUSAL OF ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS SINCE SEPTEMBER THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY HAS BEEN DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF INSURRECTION
IF COMPROMISE CONTINUES THE REVOLUTION DISAPPEARS
IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE BLUFFED OUR PAST THE GUARDS AT THE GATE OF THE FORTRESS AND WENT FORWARD UNDER THE FAINT GLIMMER OF RARE ELECTRIC LIGHTS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CHURCH WHERE LIE THE TOMBS OF THE TSARS BENEATH THE SLENDER GOLDEN SPIRE AND THE CHIMES WHICH FOR MONTHS CONTINUED TO PLAY BOZHE TSARIA KHRANI_[17 EVERY DAY AT NOON
YOU CANNOT COUNT ON THE EFFECTIVE HELP OF THE PROLETARIAT OF THE ALLIED COUNTRIES BECAUSE IN MOST COUNTRIES IT IS VERY FAR FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND TSAY-EE-KAH AND BUREAU OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
THE BEST WAY TO BEGIN IS TO FORM COSSACKS SOVIETS
HE WAS A PROMINENT FIGURE IN THE CORRUPT IMPERIAL COURT
BUT IT HAD COME--ROUGH STRONG IMPATIENT OF FORMULAS CONTEMPTUOUS OF SENTIMENTALISM
A SOLDIER CLIMBED UP HIS FACE WHITE AND STRAINED COMRADES HE CRIED I CAME FROM THE RUMANIAN FRONT TO URGENTLY TELL YOU ALL
TO THIS END THE PROPERTIED CLASSES FINALLY RESORTED TO DESPERATE MEASURES
MANY CASES OF DRUNKENNESS HAD BEEN REMARKED THE LAST TWO DAYS
THE CITY ENGINEER POINTED TO THEM TRIUMPHANTLY
I SAY OPENLY AND FRANKLY
THE LONG BARE DIMLY-ILLUMINATED HALLS ROARED WITH THE THUNDER OF FEET CALLING SHOUTING
A FEW SHOTS WERE FIRED AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD NO LONGER OPPOSE THE SOVIETS
DAN A MILD-FACED BALDISH FIGURE IN A SHAPELESS MILITARY SURGEON'S UNIFORM WAS RINGING THE BELL
THE CITY DUMA REFERRED TO IN THIS BOOK WAS THE REORGANISED MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OFTEN CALLED MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IT WAS ELECTED BY DIRECT AND SECRET BALLOT AND ITS ONLY REASON FOR FAILURE TO HOLD THE MASSES DURING THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION WAS THE GENERAL DECLINE IN INFLUENCE OF ALL PURELY POLITICAL REPRESENTATION IN THE FACT OF THE GROWING POWER OF ORGANISATIONS BASED ON ECONOMIC GROUPS
BUT IF WE WAIT A WEEK THE COUNTRY WILL BE SO DISORGANISED THAT THE GERMAN IMPERIALISTS WILL BE VICTORIOUS
IN THE CONFERENCE ITSELF EVERYTHING SEEMED ON THE POINT OF FINAL SETTLEMENT
THERE WERE NATIONAL CONGRESSES OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS SOVIETS TRADE UNIONS FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES ARMY AND FLEET COMMITTEES--BESIDES EVERY BRANCH OF THE MILITARY AND NAVAL SERVICE COOPERATIVES NATIONALITIES ETC
ON THE WALLS OF RESTAURANTS THEY PUT UP SIGNS WHICH READ NO TIPS TAKEN HERE OR JUST BECAUSE A MAN HAS TO MAKE HIS LIVING WAITING ON TABLE IS NO REASON TO INSULT HIM BY OFFERING HIM A TIP AT THE FRONT THE SOLDIERS FOUGHT OUT THEIR FIGHT WITH THE OFFICERS AND LEARNED SELF-GOVERNMENT THROUGH THEIR COMMITTEES
THE NATURAL ORGANS OF WORKERS CONTROL INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL PLANT WILL BE THE FACTORY-SHOP AND SIMILAR COMMITTEES
AND THE EMPLOYEES SUMMONED TO RETURN OR FORFEIT THEIR POSITIONS AND THEIR PENSIONS EITHER STAYED AWAY OR RETURNED TO SABOTAGE
RUSSIA WILL REMAIN A GREAT POWER WHATEVER HAPPENS
THE ARMY IS NOT WITH THEM THE HALL ROCKED WITH CHEERING
AND IT ISN'T WE WHO HAVE DECLARED WAR
AND THE ALLIED EMBASSIES WERE EITHER COLDLY INDIFFERENT OR OPENLY HOSTILE
MORE ARMS AND PROVISIONS FOR THE ARMY
THE FIRST TASK NOW IS TO GUARD THE APPROACHES TO PETROGRAD
12 OCTOBER 1812 AND 6 NOVEMBER 1812 AND 16/28 AUGUST 1813
EVEN MR A
IN SMOLNY INSTITUTE THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE FLASHED BALEFUL FIRE POUNDING LIKE AN OVER-LOADED DYNAMO
BY THE ADMISSION OF ULIANOV-LENIN HIMSELF THE SITUATION OF THE EXTREME LEFT WING OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS IN RUSSIA IS VERY FAVOURABLE HERE KERENSKY READ THE FOLLOWING QUOTATION FROM LENIN'S ARTICLE
RAPE OF THE WOMEN'S BATTALION IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TAKING OF THE WINTER PALACE ALL SORTS OF SENSATIONAL STORIES WERE PUBLISHED IN THE ANTI-BOLSHEVIK PRESS AND TOLD IN THE CITY DUMA ABOUT THE FATE OF THE WOMEN'S BATTALION DEFENDING THE PALACE
I HAVE NO PENCIL CRIED ANTONOV
AMID RENEWED TUMULT THE MAYOR ANNOUNCED THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI ALREADY WERE VIOLATING MUNICIPAL AUTONOMY BY APPOINTING COMMISSARS IN MANY DEPARTMENTS
HOWEVER WE DON'T WANT YOU CITIZEN
THE MINISTRIES WON'T WORK
YOU CANNOT GO IN
FROM THE FRONT
THE SOLDIERS ON THE ROOF KICKED WITH THEIR HEELS AND SANG WHINING PEASANT SONGS
ALL THESE MENSHEVIKI AND BOLSHEVIKI AND TRUDOVIKI
FOLLOWED HIM GHARRA
THEY WILL NEVER DARE FIRE ON YOU THERE HE SAID
PARTICULARLY SHOULD BE NOTICED THE ACTIVITY OF THE PRESENT PRESIDENT OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET BRONSTEIN-TROTZKY
HAUGHTY AND SPITEFUL THE GIRLS LEFT THE PLACE
IN IT STOOD TWO OR THREE BRAKEMAN A FIREMAN OR SO
MILLIONS OF PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS ARE WITH US
THE LEADING PARTIES OF THE COUNCIL ARE ACTING AS A VOLUNTARY COVER FOR THESE POLICIES
THE NEWS OF AN ARMISTICE IS PREMATURE
LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS WELL DIDN'T THEY SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN A SLING
EVERYBODY CROWDED AROUND
IN 1905 AND IN THE KORNILOV DAYS THE RAILWAY WORKERS WERE THE BEST DEFENDERS OF THE REVOLUTION
YOU ARE PROBABLY A GREAT HERO I AM SAID THE STUDENT WITH CONVICTION
ONLY THREE ARE LEFT OF THE ABOVE
I WAS SENT HERE ONLY FOR INFORMATION AND I AM RETURNING AT ONCE TO THE FRONT WHERE ALL THE ARMY COMMITTEES CONSIDER THAT THE TAKING OF POWER BY THE SOVIETS ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS A STAB IN THE BACK OF THE ARMY AND A CRIME AGAINST THE PEOPLE SHOUTS OF LIE
BUT THERE ARE ORDERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THESE ORDERS MUST BE OBEYED
UNDER THE OLD REGIME A FAMOUS CONVENT-SCHOOL FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF THE RUSSIAN NOBILITY PATRONISED BY THE TSARINA HERSELF THE INSTITUTE HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
ALL BUT A FEW WHO IN THEIR PANIC TRIED TO FLEE OVER THE ROOFS OR TO HIDE IN THE ATTIC AND WERE FOUND AND HURLED INTO THE STREET
STICK STUBBORNLY TO YOUR POSTS
HIS EYES FLASHED FIRE
AT SMOLNY THERE WERE STRICT GUARDS AT THE DOOR AND THE OUTER GATES DEMANDING EVERYBODY'S PASS
GORKY WAS HOPEFUL
THE RESULTS OF SUCH A POLICY ARE KNOWN
NIKITIN
THEY JOINED THE GROUP BEHIND THE COLONEL PEERING AT THE MAP
OH HE ANSWERED WITH THE EXPRESSION OF A DISAPPOINTED SMALL BOY
WE MUST PROPOSE TO THE DEMOCRACY TERMS OF AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE AFTER A RECESS TO CONSIDER THIS ULTIMATUM THE BOLSHEVIKI RETURNED WITH A RESOLUTION READ BY KAMENIEV
STRICT ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL
CHIEF OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE FOR THE SECRETARY LATE IN THE NIGHT WE WENT THROUGH THE EMPTY STREETS AND UNDER THE IBERIAN GATE TO THE GREAT RED SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE KREMLIN
ALEXANDER FEODORVITCH IS EXTREMELY OCCUPIED JUST NOW HE LOOKED AT US FOR A MOMENT
I HAVE NOT COME HERE WITH A PRAYER BUT TO STATE MY FIRM CONVICTION THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH DEFENDS AT THIS MOMENT OUR NEW LIBERTY--THAT THE NEW RUSSIAN STATE DESTINED TO A BRILLIANT FUTURE WILL FIND UNANIMOUS SUPPORT EXCEPT AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER DARED TO FACE THE TRUTH
15 GAVE AN ENORMOUS PLURALITY TO THE BOLSHEVIKI
A SENTRY OUTSIDE A DOOR IN A CURVING WHITE WING OF THE PALACE SAID THAT THE COMMANDANT WAS INSIDE
AND CONCLUDED BY GREETING THE BOLSHEVIKI IN PRISON BIDDING THEM REJOICE FOR THE HOUR OF THEIR LIBERATION WAS AT HAND
AT FIRST THE PLACE FILLED WITH THE INTELLECTUALS--THOSE WHO LIVED NEAR THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN
I WANT THAT MACHINE SAID ANTONOV
AND THEY DELAYED OR PREVENTED ANY NEW ELECTIONS
10 SEE NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
THERE IS NOTHING TO DO
HE IS READY AND WILLING TO FIGHT HIS OPPRESSOR THE CAPITALIST CLASS TO A FINISH
HOWEVER IT WAS THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WHO WHEN THEY REALISED THE GROWTH IN POWER OF THE POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS UNDERTOOK TO DESTROY THEM AND TO HALT THE REVOLUTION
ONCE BEFORE ON THE 9TH OF NOVEMBER THERE HAD BEEN A SIMILAR EFFORT AT CONCILIATION LED BY MARTOV AND GORKY
THE PROMISE OF IMMEDIATE PEACE--IS A LIE
EVEN UNDER THE TSAR SUCH THINGS COULD NOT HAPPEN IN RUSSIA
THE CADET MINISTRY WAS OVERTHROWN IN APRIL BECAUSE IT DECLARED ITSELF IN FAVOUR OF ALLIED IMPERIALISTIC AIMS INCLUDING THE IMPERIALISTIC AIMS OF THE TSAR'S GOVERNMENT
AND FROM THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS THAT UNTIL THE VERIFICATION OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY TOO COULD NOT ENTER THE PRESIDIUM
AN INSIDE DOOR SLAMMED
HOW CAN WE DO THAT LAUNCH ANOTHER DECREE ABOUT ARRESTING NERATOV ANSWERS URITZKY WITH A PROFOUND AIR
NOBODY EITHER IN RUSSIA OR IN THE COUNTRIES OF OUR ALLIES WILL RECOGNISE THIS GOVERNMENT"--OR EVEN IN THE ENEMY COUNTRIES
WHO FORCED HIM TO DESERT

IF THE CONGRESS WISHES TO BE THE VOICE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY IT MUST NOT SIT WITH FOLDED HANDS BEFORE THE DEVELOPING CIVIL WAR THE RESULT OF WHICH MAY BE A DANGEROUS OUTBURST OF COUNTER-REVOLUTION
THE SOVIETS ARE OPEN TO ALL SOCIALIST PARTIES AND THE TSAY-EE-KAH REPRESENTS THEM IN THEIR REAL PROPORTIONS AMONG THE MASSES KARELIN FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES DECLARED THAT HIS PARTY WOULD VOTE FOR THE BOLSHEVIK RESOLUTION RESERVING THE RIGHT TO MODIFY CERTAIN DETAILS SUCH AS THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEASANTS AND DEMANDING THAT THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE BE RESERVED FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
ON NOVEMBER 15TH IN ALL THE CHURCHES OF THE CAPITAL THE PRIESTS STOPPED PRAYING FOR IT
WE DEMAND THAT THIS STORY BE INVESTIGATED AT ONCE
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WORD OF IT SPREAD THROUGH THE CITY AND HUNDREDS OF BOURGEOIS CALLED UP TO SCREAM FOOLS
A THREE-INCH CANNON WAS LOADED AND THEN TIED ONTO THE TAIL OF THE TRUCK WITH BITS OF ROPE AND WIRE

IT HAS ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY HUGE WINE DEPOTS AND DISTRIBUTES LIQUOR AMONG THE SOLDIERS IN THIS MANNER ATTEMPTING TO SOW DISSATISFACTION IN THE RANKS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
STILL OTHERS WERE DESPATCHED TO PROVINCIAL CITIES TO FORM BRANCHES OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND LINK TOGETHER THE ANTI-BOLSHEVIK ELEMENTS
IN JULY LAST A SERIES OF OPEN BREAKS BEGAN BETWEEN THE POPULAR MASSES AND THE COMPROMISERS

KERENSKY AGREED TO LET KALEDIN ALONE AND THEN IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID IN THE EYES OF THE SOVIET LEADERS I AM A DESPOT AND A TYRANT
ALL ROSE POLITELY AS I ENTERED AND MADE A PLACE FOR ME BESIDE THE COLONEL A LARGE IMPRESSIVE MAN WITH A GRIZZLED BEARD
OVER THE BLEAK PLAIN ON THE COLD QUIET AIR SPREAD THE SOUND OF BATTLE FALLING UPON THE EARS OF ROVING BANDS AS THEY GATHERED ABOUT THEIR LITTLE FIRES WAITING
THIS WAS VERA SLUTSKAYA VETERAN REVOLUTIONIST AND BOLSHEVIK MEMBER OF THE DUMA
THE DOOR OPENED A BLAST OF STALE AIR AND CIGARETTE SMOKE RUSHED OUT WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF DISHEVELLED MEN BENDING OVER A MAP UNDER THE GLARE OF A SHADED ELECTRIC-LIGHT
THE TRIAL IS DESCRIBED IN THE CHAPTER ON REVOLUTIONARY JUSTICE IN MY FORTHCOMING VOLUME KORNILOV TO BRIST-LITOVSK THE PRISONER WAS SENTENCED TO RETURN THE MONEY AND THEN BE LIBERATED TO THE PUBLIC CONTEMPT IN OTHER WORDS SHE WAS SET FREE
AND IT IS KNOWN TO ALL THAT THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE FORMATION OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND BEFORE PROPOSING THE LIST OF ITS MEMBERS TO THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS INVITED TO ITS MEETING THREE OF THE MOST EMINENT MEMBERS OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY GROUP COMRADES KAMKOV SPIRO AND KARELIN AND ASKED THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT
UNDER THE PRETEXT OF ESTABLISHING ORDER AND OF PROTECTING THE INHABITANTS THEY HOPE TO ESTABLISH THE DOMINATION OF KORNILOV WHICH THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING NOT LONG AGO
THE STATEMENT OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PAPER NAROD AND OF MEMBERS OF THE CITY DUMA TO THE EFFECT THAT PRECIOUS OBJECTS TO THE VALUE OF 500,000,000 RUBLES HAD BEEN STOLEN WAS HOWEVER A GROSS EXAGGERATION
THE MIND OF A EUROPEAN DOES NOT ADMIT OF ANY OTHER SITUATION AS THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY ORGAN WHICH IS CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS
RUN ALONG HOME NOW THERE WAS LAUGHTER
BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPS THERE ARE NO GROUPS OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE
FORM LOCAL COMMITTEES FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION WHO WILL UNITE ALL DEMOCRATIC FORCES SO AS TO AID THE ALL-RUSSIAN COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION IN THE TASKS WHICH IT HAS SET ITSELF

THESE STATEMENTS WOULD HAVE SOME VALUE IF THEIR AUTHORS HAD BEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ARMY WILD APPLAUSE
FOR ONLY THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION CAN ACCOMPLISH THE DEFINITE TRANSFER WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF RETURN OF THE LAND TO THE PEASANT-WORKERS THE CONFISCATION OF MODEL FARMS AND THEIR SURRENDER TO THE PEASANT COMMUNES THE CONFISCATION OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY BELONGING TO THE GREAT LAND-OWNERS THE SAFE-GUARDING OF THE INTERESTS OF THE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS BY THE COMPLETE ABOLITION OF WAGE-SLAVERY THE REGULAR AND METHODICAL DISTRIBUTION AMONG ALL REGIONS OF RUSSIA OF THE PRODUCTS OF AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRY AND THE SEIZURE OF THE BANKS WITHOUT WHICH THE POSSESSION OF LAND BY THE WHOLE PEOPLE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THE ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND ALL SORTS OF ASSISTANCE BY THE STATE TO THE WORKERS
UNTIL THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY THE ENACTING AND PUBLISHING OF LAWS SHALL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE ORDER DECREED BY THE PRESENT PROVISIONAL WORKMEN'S AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT ELECTED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
WE MOUNTED A WINDING STAIR AND EMERGED INTO A GREAT BARE ROOM WITH A HUGE STOVE IN THE CENTRE AND ROWS OF COTS ON THE FLOOR WHERE ABOUT A THOUSAND SOLDIERS WERE PLAYING CARDS TALKING SINGING AND ASLEEP
AND WORSE STILL THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF THE STUDENTS AND OF THE WOMEN READ THESE FRIGHTFUL DETAILS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY LISTS OF NAMES AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL THE DUMA BEGAN TO BE BESIEGED BY FRANTIC CITIZENS
SIBERIA THE CAUCASUS DEMANDED SEPARATE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLIES
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS DECREES ON THE LABOUR QUESTION WILL BE ISSUED AND AMONG THE VERY FIRST WILL BE THE DECREE ON WORKERS CONTROL OVER THE PRODUCTION AND REGULATION OF INDUSTRY
TO A FOREIGN JOURNALIST WHO ASKED TROTZKY WHAT STATEMENT HE HAD TO MAKE TO THE WORLD TROTZKY REPLIED
THEY DEMANDED IF IT WERE TRUE THAT THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT DID NOT INTEND TO DIVIDE THE COSSACK LANDS AMONG THE PEASANTS OF GREAT RUSSIA
FOR THE GOVERNMENT WAS THEIR GOVERNMENT THEIR SOVIETS--AND THE FUNCTIONARIES OF THE MINISTRIES WERE AGAINST IT
THE PEASANTS WERE CONVINCED THAT NOW THE PRACTICAL SOLUTION OF THE LAND QUESTION WOULD BEGIN
DELEGATES FROM THE GROUP OF PUBLIC MEN WERE GIVEN PORTFOLIOS IN THE LAST KERENSKY CABINET
TWO COMPANIES OF YUNKERS PASSED SWINGING UP THE MORSKAYA TRAMPING STIFFLY IN THEIR LONG COATS AND SINGING AN OLDTIME CRASHING CHORUS SUCH AS THE SOLDIERS USED TO SING UNDER THE TSAR
OF COURSE ALL THE THEATRES WERE GOING EVERY NIGHT INCLUDING SUNDAYS
IN FACT HE IS NOT HERE WHERE IS HE HE HAS GONE TO THE FRONT
THE BOLSHEVIKI TO A QUESTION ADDRESSED TO THEM IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH DENIED THAT THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
THE AIR WAS FULL OF RUMOURS ABOUT KERENSKY WHO WAS SAID TO HAVE RAISED THE FRONT AND TO BE LEADING A GREAT ARMY AGAINST THE CAPITAL
THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE FOR US
WE STOPPED WORK
IF YOU DO NOT THEN GO GO TO THE IGNORANT PEOPLE SEDUCED BY THE BETRAYERS AND TELL THEM THE WHOLE TRUTH WHICH WE HAVE TOLD YOU
FROM THERE I HURRIED TO SMOLNY
UP THE NEVSKY AS WE PASSED RED GUARDS WERE MARCHING ALL ARMED SOME WITH BAYONETS AND SOME WITHOUT
WHAT ABOUT DEEDS
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VLADIMIR ULIANOV LENIN ON WORKERS MILITIA 1
MINE HE CRIED HIS FACE ALL ALIGHT
ALL THESE STORIES WERE SWALLOWED WHOLE BY THE CROWD IN THE DUMA
WHY EVERYBODY KNEW THAT TSARSKOYE WAS IN KERENSKY'S HANDS AND THAT THE COSSACKS WERE NOW AT PULKOVO
THE LABOUR MOVEMENT IN THE NAME OF PEACE AND SOCIALISM SHALL WIN AND FULFIL ITS DESTINY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUIET AND POWERFUL IN ALL THIS WHICH STIRRED THE SOULS OF MEN
A HUNDRED HANDS REACHED UP TO HELP HIM DOWN AND THE GREAT DIM SPACES OF THE HALL GAVE BACK THE SURF OF SOUND THAT BEAT UPON HIM
WE CANNOT FIGHT EITHER GERMANS OR RUSSIANS WITH THAT HE LEAPED DOWN AND A SORT OF CONFUSED AGONISED SOUND ROSE UP FROM ALL THAT SURGING MASS WHICH BURST INTO SOMETHING LIKE ANGER WHEN THE NEXT SPEAKER A MENSHEVIK OBORONETZ TRIED TO SAY THAT THE WAR MUST GO ON UNTIL THE ALLIES WERE VICTORIOUS
AND THIRD THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
NERATOV CLIMBS A WALL TROTZKY TOO
CHAIRMAN OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKER'S AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR LEON TROTZKY
WAYS TO PEACE THE ALLIES ARE TO ANNOUNCE IMMEDIATELY THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO OPEN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AS SOON AS THE ENEMY POWERS DECLARE THEIR CONSENT TO THE RENUNCIATION OF ALL FORCIBLE ANNEXATIONS
TO TOLERATE THE BOURGEOIS NEWSPAPERS WOULD MEAN TO CEASE BEING A SOCIALIST
IN DAN'S RESOLUTION TO-DAY AT THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC THERE WAS NO MENTION OF ENFORCING DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY ALTHOUGH THAT IS URGED IN THE PROPAGANDA OF HIS PARTY
IN THE DAYTIME GREAT CROWDS GATHERED ON THE SIDEWALKS LISTENING TO INTERMINABLE HOT DEBATES BETWEEN STUDENTS AND SOLDIERS BUSINESS MEN AND WORKMEN
UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS ALSO CALLED THE NOVAYA ZHIZN NEW LIFE GROUP FROM THE NAME OF THE VERY INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER WHICH WAS ITS ORGAN
IF THERE IS ANY VYSTUPLENNIE THERE WILL BE NO CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY CRIES LIE
STARTING FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW THEY WERE ABLE TO COMMIT THE UNCONSCIOUS TREASON IN WARTIME OF CALMLY TELLING THE SOLDIERS TO ABANDON THE TRENCHES AND INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE EXTERNAL ENEMY CREATING INTERNAL CIVIL WAR AND ATTACKING THE PROPRIETORS AND CAPITALISTS
FIRST THE GREAT MUNITIONS WORKS WERE TO GO DISTRIBUTED WIDELY THROUGHOUT RUSSIA
THE LADIES OF THE MINOR BUREAUCRATIC SET TOOK TEA WITH EACH OTHER IN THE AFTERNOON CARRYING EACH HER LITTLE GOLD OR SILVER OR JEWELLED SUGAR-BOX AND HALF A LOAF OF BREAD IN HER MUFF AND WISHED THAT THE TSAR WERE BACK OR THAT THE GERMANS WOULD COME OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD SOLVE THE SERVANT PROBLEM
THE PEOPLE CREATE THE AUTHORITY THEMSELVES
A DUN HERD OF ARMOURED CARS STOOD UNDER THE TREES IN THE COURT-YARD ENGINES GOING
DETACHMENTS OF CRONSTADT SAILORS AND OF THE SEMIONOVSKY AND ISMAILOVSKY REGIMENTS GAVE UP THEIR ARMS WITHOUT RESISTANCE AND JOINED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS
THEY CHARGE US WITH STEALING THEIR LAND PROGRAMME
DO NOT OBEY DUKHONIN
PEASANTS UNION IN 1905 THE PEASANTS UNION WAS A REVOLUTIONARY PEASANTS ORGANISATION
12 IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC BRANDING THE SKOBELIEV NAKAZ AS PRO-GERMAN DECLARING THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY WAS DESTROYING RUSSIA SNEERING AT TERESTCHENKO AND OPENLY DECLARING THAT HE PREFERRED GERMAN DIPLOMACY TO RUSSIAN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AN AWKWARD RED GUARD WAS TRYING TO RIDE ONE FALLING OFF AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE CHILDLIKE DELIGHT OF A THOUSAND ROUGH MEN
THESE THEY THREW INTO THE TRUCK
HE BOWED AND CLICKED HIS HEELS
I'LL HAVE YOU ALL SHOT AFTER READING ALOUD TO THEM THE ORDER APPOINTING HIM COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE PETROGRAD DISTRICT KRASNOV ASKED IF THEY WERE BOLSHEVIKI
TELL ME FRANKLY YOU PEASANTS TO WHOM WE HAVE GIVEN THE LANDS OF THE POMIESHTCHIKI DO YOU WANT NOW TO PREVENT THE WORKERS FROM GETTING CONTROL OF INDUSTRY
BUT WITHOUT THAT FIRST SUCCESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT ON A SINGLE SOLDIER BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE DIVIDED AND TERRORISED BY THE SCUM WHICH EXISTS IN EVERY REGIMENT
ABROAD THE REVOLUTION IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE WHAT IS YOUR EXPLANATION OF WHY THE RUSSIANS HAVE STOPPED FIGHTING THAT IS A FOOLISH QUESTION TO ASK KERENSKY WAS ANNOYED
THE SEMIONOVSKY REGIMENT HAD ALREADY DECIDED TO SUBMIT TO THE ORDERS OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
THIS CONFERENCE APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO GO AND PERSUADE KERENSKY'S TROOPS TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS

WITH SUCH A GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE NO NEED FOR CIVIL WAR AND THE KILLING OF BROTHER BY BROTHER THIS SOUNDED REASONABLE--THE GREAT HALL ECHOED TO THE CRASH OF HANDS AND VOICES
THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO MEET AN AMERICAN REPORTER
ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BOOK ARE
THE AUTOMOBILE ONLY HELD FIVE--THE TWO COMMISSARS TWO ORDERLIES AND THE CHAUFFEUR
IF IT IS THE PEASANTS WISHES WHY WILL THEY OPPOSE IT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE ARE YOU GOING I SHOUTED
ONE BY ONE THE FIVE HUNDRED COFFINS WERE LAID IN THE PITS
THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE RIGHT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
ALREADY SEVERAL MEN WERE THERE AMONG THEM MURANOV THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN ELECTED COMMANDANT OF MOSCOW--A TALL SIMPLE-LOOKING BEARDED MAN WITH A GENTLE FACE
FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE VIKZHEL DEMANDED MONEY TO PAY THE SALARIES OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE GOVERNMENT RAILROADS IT WAS TOLD TO APPLY TO SMOLNY
WE HAVE SIGNED AN ARMISTICE WITH YOU
APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION TO WORKERS AND SOLDIERS COMRADES
THE POPULATION IS INVITED TO ARREST HOOLIGANS AND BLACK HUNDRED AGITATORS AND TAKE THEM TO THE SOVIET COMMISSARS AT THE NEAREST BARRACKS
HAS ANY ONE A PIECE OF PAPER DYBENKO HAD NONE--NOR THE COURIERS
NO LESS CRIMINAL ALSO IS THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY OF THE BOURGEOISIE AND ITS GOVERNMENT
OCCASIONALLY SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY MOUNTED THE TRIBUNE AND ASKED THE COMRADES NOT TO SMOKE
THE BOLSHEVIK COMMISSAR IS WITH THE MAYOR NOW AS WE REACHED THE TOP RIAZANOV CAME HURRYING OUT
THIS REQUEST WAS GRANTED
PRODUCED BY NORMAN WOLCOTT WITH CORRECTIONS BY ANDREW SLY AND STEFAN MALTE SCHUMACHER REDACTOR'S NOTE
HE LOOKED AT IT
ONE VOICE RENEGADES YOU CALL YOURSELVES SOCIALISTS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UKRAINEAN DELEGATES DEMANDED AND RECEIVED A PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS ISSUED AN EMERGENCY CALL FOR A PEASANTS CONGRESS TO MEET DECEMBER 13TH AND OFFSET WHATEVER ACTION THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS MIGHT TAKE
YOU COMMITTED A CRIME LONG AGO WHEN YOU CAPTURED THE POWER AND TURNED IT OVER TO THE BOURGEOISIE GOTZ RINGING THE CHAIRMAN'S BELL
HERE SAID THE DRIVER AS WE WENT ON OVER A BARREN HILL HERE WAS WHERE VERA SLUTSKAYA DIED
KHANJUNOV AND WHISTLED INSULTINGLY WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKI TRIED TO SPEAK
RIGHT DO VOLNO ENOUGH DOLOI DOWN WITH HIM POSOR SHAME AND TEESCHE SILENCE
THE MAJORITY OF THE PEASANTS WILL NOT BE WITH YOU FOR YOU CANNOT GIVE THEM THE MACHINERY THEY NEED
WITHIN WERE MORE THAN A HUNDRED HUGE ROOMS WHITE AND BARE ON THEIR DOORS ENAMELLED PLAQUES STILL INFORMING THE PASSERBY THAT WITHIN WAS LADIES CLASS-ROOM NUMBER 4 OR TEACHERS BUREAU
ALL IS EMPTY AND SILENT AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
NERATOV CLIMBS ONTO THE ROOF--TROTZKY RIGHT BEHIND HIM
THE SITUATION CANNOT BE SAVED EXCEPT BY CREATING REGIMENTS OF OFFICERS AND YUNKERS ATTACKING WITH THESE REGIMENTS AND HAVING GAINED A FIRST SUCCESS WE COULD LATER GAIN THE AID OF THE GARRISON TROOPS
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ALL RALLIED TO THIS RESOLUTION
AT PSKOV THE SOVIET DELEGATES WERE MET BY GENERAL TCHEREMISSOV COMMANDER OF THE NORTHERN FRONT WITH THE CURT DECLARATION THAT HE HAD ORDERED THE PETROGRAD GARRISON TO THE TRENCHES AND THAT WAS ALL
HOWEVER IT IS NO PART OF MY PURPOSE IN THIS BOOK TO DESCRIBE AND INTERPRET THESE VERY IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENTS WHICH REQUIRE MORE SPACE
WE WALKED BACK UP TO THE RED ARCH WHERE A KNOT OF SOLDIERS WAS GATHERED STARING AT THE BRIGHTLY-LIGHTED WINTER PALACE AND TALKING IN LOUD TONES
THE OFFICIALS OF THE CREDIT CHANCERY DESTROYED THEIR BOOKS SO THAT ALL RECORD OF THE FINANCIAL RELATIONS OF RUSSIA WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES WAS LOST
YOU ARE THE YOUNG MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY AND ALTHOUGH NOW YOU HAVE MUCH TO DO AND THINK ABOUT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO DEFEND YOUR ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC TREASURES
PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR MILITARY AFFAIRS N

DETACHMENTS OF THE TWO REGIMENTS MENTIONED--NOT THE SAILORS--WHILE WANDERING CAPTAINLESS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD INDEED BEEN SURROUNDED BY COSSACKS AND GIVEN UP THEIR ARMS

THIS WAS KHANJUNOV WHO HAD BEEN PRESIDENT OF LAST SUMMER'S ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF BRUNNOVIKI A LITHE HANDSOME FIGURE IN HIS LEATHER COAT WITH LIEUTENANT'S SHOULDER-STRAPS HE STOOD PLEADING ELOQUENTLY FOR NEUTRALITY
THIS IS NOT EXPLAINED LENIN THE PROJECT OF FORMER MINISTER TCHERNOV WHO SPOKE OF ERECTING A FRAME-WORK AND TRIED TO REALISE REFORMS FROM ABOVE
WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING THUS CHARACTERISES THEM
BUT WHAT I SAID DO YOU INTEND TO DO NOW THE TWO MEN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER
LOZOVSKY RISING ANNOUNCED THAT UPON AGREEMENT OF THE BUREAU OF ALL FACTIONS IT WAS PROPOSED TO HEAR AND DISCUSS THE REPORT OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET THEN TO GIVE THE FLOOR TO MEMBERS OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND THE DIFFERENT PARTIES AND FINALLY TO PASS TO THE ORDER OF THE DAY
A STRANGLER OF WORKERS
TO-MORROW WE SHALL BURY HERE FIVE HUNDRED PROLETARIANS WHO DIED FOR THE REVOLUTION HE TOOK US DOWN INTO THE PIT
AFTER THEM FOLLOWED SINGLE FILE HALF A DOZEN MEN IN CIVILIAN DRESS--THE MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
FOR THIS DID THEY LIE THERE THE MARTYRS OF MARCH IN THEIR COLD BROTHERHOOD GRAVE ON MARS FIELD
THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE REVOLUTION
THEY KEEP SILENT JUST AS IF THEY HAD HEARD NOTHING
IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD BE A MEASURE OF UNQUESTIONABLY COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CHARACTER
INSTANTLY THE SOLDIERS CHANGED THEIR ATTITUDE
THEY HAD THE BOLSHEVIK PASSWORD AND TOOK CHARGE WITHOUT AROUSING SUSPICION
THE LEFT BENCHES WERE ONE ROARING TUMULT ALL THROUGH
THE OFFICIAL CONGRESS WAS CALLED FOR DECEMBER 13TH
THE CULPRITS EITHER SULLENLY SURRENDERED OR PLEADED LIKE CHILDREN
IF THE BOLSHEVIKI SUCCEED OR IF THEY FAIL THE FATE OF RUSSIA WILL NOT BE CHANGED
OUR PAPERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE IN THE TRENCHES
I TOOK ONE OF THESE SCRIBBLED PAGES IN THE HAND WRITING OF KONOVALOV WHICH READ THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT APPEALS TO ALL CLASSES TO SUPPORT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ALL THIS TIME IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ALTHOUGH THE WINTER PALACE WAS SURROUNDED THE GOVERNMENT WAS IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE FRONT AND WITH PROVINCIAL RUSSIA

AS FOR PRAVDA IT SNEERED
GRAPHIC PAGE 49
ONLY A FEW ARC-LIGHTS WERE BURNING ONLY A FEW PEDESTRIANS HURRIED ALONG THE SIDE-WALKS
TRANSPORTATION WAS PARALYSED
I AM A DOOMED MAN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME AND I HAVE THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT THE OTHER ENIGMATIC PART IS THAT OF THE UNBELIEVABLE PROVOCATION CREATED IN THE CITY BY THE BOLSHEVIKI 11 THIS WAS NOT QUITE CANDID
THE FIRST THING WAS TO CONNECT SMOLNY WITH THE BARRACKS AND THE FACTORIES
BY THAT TIME THE CONGRESS WILL BE ORGANISED AND IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGE ORGANISED BODY OF PEOPLE TO TAKE SWIFT DECISIVE ACTION
YOUR WAGES WILL BE IMMEDIATELY RAISED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RUBLES AND YOUR WORKING-HOURS REDUCED
NIGHT AND DAY AND NIGHT AND DAY THEY THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE TERRIBLE MACHINE
COME I SAID
DURING THE PERIOD OF TSARISM THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA WERE SYSTEMATICALLY INCITED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
AN ENORMOUS POSTER CARRIED THE HYSTERICAL MANIFESTO OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS
RED GUARDS AND SAILORS FILLED THE COURT-YARD SENTRIES STOOD AT THE DOORS AND A STREAM OF COURIERS AND COMMISSARS PUSHED IN AND OUT
YOU SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT GIVING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND YOU COMMIT AN ACT OF TYRANTS AND USURPERS AGAINST THE PEASANTS CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES
WHO ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE WORK OF THESE MURDERERS OF THE PEOPLE WHICH GOES ON BEHIND OFFICIAL CURTAINS
AND IN THAT CASE THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO CANCEL THE POWERS OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH
FROM THE WARSAW RAILWAY STATION COULD BE HEARD FAR-OFF CANNONADE
THE SOVIET FORCES COMPLIED AND AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE KREMLIN WERE SET UPON AND SHOT DOWN
MILIUTIN COMMISSAR OF AGRICULTURE REMARKED THAT THE PEASANTS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD CALLED AN ALL-RUSSIAN PEASANT CONGRESS FOR DECEMBER 13TH
THE CONGRESS RESOLVES
UNTIL THEN THE MINISTRY MUST PLAY THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE APPARATUS FOR BOTH THE STATE COMMITTEE AND THE STATE COMMISSION FOR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION
ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 8TH HE ARRIVED BY AUTOMOBILE AT LUGA WHERE HE WAS WELL RECEIVED BY THE DEATH BATTALIONS STATIONED THERE
RED GUARDS CAME TO MOUNT GUARD
AT THIS MOMENT THE ONLY STATEMENT POSSIBLE IS THE ONE WE ARE MAKING THROUGH THE MOUTHS OF OUR CANNON BUT THERE WAS AN UNDERCURRENT OF REAL ANXIETY IN THE TIDE OF VICTORY
THAT MINUTE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF COMING AND GOING SO HE SLIPPED OUT AND CAME DOWN TO THE GUARD-ROOM LEAVING THE OTHER COMRADE TO PICK UP WHAT HE COULD
THROUGH THE HOUSE COMMITTEES IT CALLS UPON THE POPULATION OF THE TOWN OF PETROGRAD TO MEET WITH DECISIVE REPULSE ALL ATTEMPTS TO ENTER BY FORCE PRIVATE APARTMENTS NOT STOPPING AT THE USE OF ARMS IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SELF-DEFENCE OF CITIZENS
IN PETROGRAD WAS ENDING A REGIONAL CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF THE NORTH PRESIDED OVER BY THE BOLSHEVIK KRYLENKO
IT WAS AS IF IN 1792 ON THE STREETS OF PARIS SOME ONE HAD SAID
THE WINTER PALACE CELLARS CONTAINING RARE VINTAGES VALUED AT MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WERE AT FIRST FLOODED AND THEN THE LIQUOR WAS REMOVED TO CRONSTADT AND DESTROYED
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WHICH ARE PROVOKING A PEASANTS REVOLT
IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC KERENSKY DECLARED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PREPARATIONS AND HAD SUFFICIENT FORCE TO COPE WITH ANY DEMONSTRATION
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES NOW IN A POSITION OF POWER BECAME ARROGANT
THROUGH STREETS FAINTLY LIGHTED AND SLIPPERY WITH MUD BETWEEN SILENT CROWDS OF BOURGEOIS CONTEMPTUOUS BUT FEARFUL
AND BEFORE HIM A THOUSAND SIMPLE FACES LOOKING UP IN INTENT ADORATION
THE TALK WAS ALL OF THE BOLSHEVIK RISING
ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS HE CRIED POUNDING ON THE TABLE
SLOWLY FROM THE GREAT SQUARE EBBED THE PROLETARIAN TIDE
EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST US
TROTZKY ANNOUNCED ITS COMPOSITION
THE VOLHYNSKY REGIMENT HAD REFUSED TO FIGHT AGAINST KERENSKY
THE PROMISE OF LAND--A FAIRY TALE
FROM NOW ON ALL THAT WILL BE CHANGED
GREAT PILES OF NEW PROCLAMATIONS SEE APP
FULL AUTHORITY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MILITARY UNITS AND COMBINATIONS IS VESTED IN THE RESPECTIVE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES AND SOVIETS
WHATEVER COMES WE SHALL NOT PERMIT OURSELVES TO BE STRUCK DOWN AND SHALL REMAIN FIRM UNTIL THE END PURISHKEVITCH BEING BROUGHT TO TRIAL BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS GIVEN A SHORT PRISON TERM
FROM ROOM TO ROOM WE WANDERED THROUGH VAST SMOLNY
SCHREIDER AND PROKOPOVITCH WERE BELLOWING AT THE BIG SAILOR WHO SEEMED IN COMMAND
THE PROPERTY AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE CLASSES OF NOBILITY ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CORRESPONDING AUTONOMOUS ZEMSTVOS

A GREAT SOLDIER MEETING AT SMOLNY ON THE 3D RESOLVED
HERE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DARK AND NOTHING MOVED BUT PICKETS OF SOLDIERS AND RED GUARDS GRIMLY INTENT

A JOINT MEETING WAS HELD AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AMONG THE CYCLISTS NOT A SINGLE MAN WAS FOUND WILLING TO SHED THE BLOOD OF HIS BROTHERS OR TO SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT OF BOURGEOIS AND LAND-OWNERS KAPELINSKI FOR THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS PROPOSED TO ELECT A SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CIVIL WAR
AS THE PEASANTS LEFT THE RANKS OF THE ESSAIRES IN INCREASING NUMBERS THEY JOINED THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY WHICH BECAME THE GREAT PEASANT PARTY SUPPORTING THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT STANDING FOR CONFISCATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION OF THE GREAT LANDED ESTATES AND THEIR DISPOSITION BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES
WHAT IS LEFT
ALL EXISTING PRIVATE JOINT-STOCK BANKS AND BANKING OFFICES ARE MERGED IN THE STATE BANK
HUNDREDS OF OUR COMRADES WERE ARRESTED IN THE JULY DAYS
THEY COMPROMISE FROM SHEER HABIT
HIS EYES WERE CLOSED AND HIS YOUNG BEARDED FACE WAS GREENISH-WHITE
HE URGED THAT THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY BE EXPANDED SO AS TO UNITE ALL THE ANTI-BOLSHEVIK ELEMENTS IN ONE HUGE ORGANISATION TO BE CALLED THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION
WE SHALL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AS A STRONG OPPOSITION
BUT THE DIRECTORS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE BOURGEOIS IN THE GOVERNMENT HAD INSISTED THAT THE QUESTION COULD NOT BE SOLVED UNTIL THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MET
GOOD FOR THE HEALTH INSIDE THE LONG GLOOMY HALLS AND BLEAK ROOMS SEEMED DESERTED
ALONG THE BANK OF THE CANAL WERE DRAWN UP IN FULL MARCHING ORDER THE SOLDIERS OF THE PAVLOVSKY REGIMENT WITH THEIR BAND WHICH BROKE INTO THE MARSEILLAISE AMID THE CRASHING FULL-THROATED SHOUTS OF THE SOLDIERS THE PEASANTS FORMED IN LINE UNFURLING THE GREAT RED BANNER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN PEASANTS SOVIETS EMBROIDERED NEWLY IN GOLD LONG LIVE THE UNION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY AND TOILING MASSES FOLLOWING WERE OTHER BANNERS
IN MANY FACTORIES AND BARRACKS ALREADY REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS WERE OPERATING AND THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE THREATENING TO SET UP MORE OF THESE AND TRY GOTZ AND AVKSENTIEV BEFORE THEM
NOW HOWEVER THE BOLSHEVIKI IN ONE NIGHT HAD DISSIPATED IT AS ONE BLOWS AWAY SMOKE
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY
THE MOST EQUITABLE SOLUTION OF THE LAND QUESTION SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS
THE SENSELESS ATTEMPT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IS ON THE EVE OF COMPLETE FAILURE
OPRITCHNIKI!_"[15 15 SAVAGE BODY-GUARDS IF IVAN THE TERRIBLE 17TH CENTURY
IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER IN PETROGRAD THERE WERE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESSES OF SOVIETS OF SOLDIERS WORKERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
UNANIMOUS
LET'S ARREST HIM SAID THE RED GUARD VENOMOUSLY
READ THEM ATTENTIVELY AND JUDGE YOURSELVES WHICH IS THE TRUTH AND WHICH IS CRUEL DECEIT
THE GOVERNMENT IS IN YOUR HANDS
IN ONE CORNER TWO CLUMSY-HANDED WORKINGMEN WERE TRYING TO MAKE A MULTIGRAPHING MACHINE GO
AT DAWN THE STATE BANK WAS SURROUNDED
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS ELECTRIC
BECAUSE THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE MADE A MILITARY CONSPIRACY WITH THE AID OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER FACTIONS AND PARTIES WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THE CONGRESS AND THEREFORE WITHDRAW INVITING THE OTHER GROUPS TO FOLLOW US AND TO MEET FOR DISCUSSION OF THE SITUATION DESERTER AT INTERVALS IN THE ALMOST CONTINUOUS DISTURBANCE HENDELMAN FOR THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES COULD BE HEARD PROTESTING AGAINST THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE WINTER PALACE
THEY STOPPED THE CAR
THE REVISION JOINTLY WITH THE NEW STATE COMMISSION OF THE LAWS ALREADY CREATED BY THE COMMITTEE A REVISION REQUIRED BY THE FACT THAT IN EDITING THEM THE COMMITTEE HAD TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BOURGEOIS SPIRIT OF PREVIOUS MINISTRIES WHICH OBSTRUCTED IT EVEN IN THIS ITS NARROWED FORM
AFTER ALL IT IS A SERIOUS CRIME TO KILL AN INNOCENT MAN WE WALKED UP TO THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND KNOCKED
OVERHEAD THE NIGHT WAS THICK WITH STARS AND THE ANCIENT IMPERIAL KREMLIN WALL TOWERED UP IMMEASURABLY
THE ANIMALS SAID HE SHAKING HIS FIRST AT IMAGINARY BOLSHEVIKI
THE DEVIL TAKE YOU CRIED THE RED GUARDS
IN THEIR CALCULATIONS THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS AND BLACK HUNDRED LEADERS ARE COUNTING ON THE SERIOUS DISCONTENT OF THE UNENLIGHTENED PART OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE DISORGANISATION OF THE FOOD-SUPPLY THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR AND THE GENERAL DIFFICULTIES OF LIFE
NO COMRADES ONE WAS SAYING
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES WELL APPOINTED AND WELL ORGANISED SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY SOVIETS COMPOSED OF THE REGULAR EMPLOYEES OF THOSE PROPERTIES UNDER THE DIRECTION OF COMPETENT AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS
THE CABINET WAS TENTATIVELY CHOSEN WITH TCHERNOV AS PREMIER
SCATTERING APPLAUSE AND HOOTS
MEANWHILE SMOLNY HAD NOT NEGLECTED THE PEASANTS
IN THE OFFICES HOWEVER EVERY DESK AND CABINET HAD BEEN RANSACKED THE PAPERS SCATTERED OVER THE FLOOR AND IN THE LIVING ROOMS BEDS HAD BEEN STRIPPED OF THEIR COVERINGS AND WARD-ROBES WRENCHED OPEN
I DON'T THINK KERENSKY'S ORDER TO SUSPEND THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE ARMY WAS DICTATED BY HIS IDEALS
WHAT DO YOU REPRESENT THEY CRIED
THE SERGEANT THEN WITHDREW AND TEN MINUTES LATER RETURNED WITH THE ORDERS TYPEWRITTEN AND ONE CARBON COPY
FAREWELL BROTHERS YOU CHOSE A NOBLE PATH YOU ARE FOLLOWED BY THE NEW AND FRESH ARMY READY TO DIE AND TO SUFFER
ON THE PLATFORM THE PRESIDIUM ROSE AND MADE PLACE FOR THE PEASANTS PRESIDIUM THE TWO EMBRACING
ITS HOLDER AUTOMATICALLY BECAME A KNIGHT OF ST GEORGE THE PREDOMINANT INFLUENCE IN THE ORGANISATION WAS THAT OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE MILITARY IDEA
THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION IS JUST BEGINNING WORDS MORE PROPHETIC PERHAPS THAN HE KNEW
THE QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN POLICY ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO THOSE OF NATIONAL DEFENCE
THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PAPER DEMANDED A CABINET WITHOUT EITHER CADETS OR BOLSHEVIKI
THE CROWD CONTROLS THE MEETING PRACTICALLY THE ONLY FUNCTIONS OF THE SPEAKER BEING TO KEEP ORDER BY RINGING A LITTLE BELL AND TO RECOGNISE SPEAKERS
TELEGRAM FROM THE FRONT
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SENT BACK WORD BROTHERS
THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE IGNORED
THE FIRST SESSION TOOK PLACE IN THE ALEXANDER HALL OF THE DUMA BUILDING AND THE FIRST VOTE SHOWED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE DELEGATES WERE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHILE THE BOLSHEVIKI CONTROLLED A BARE FIFTH THE CONSERVATIVE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES A QUARTER AND ALL THE REST WERE UNITED ONLY IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE DOMINATED BY AVKSENTIEV TCHAIKOVSKY AND PESHEKHONOV
I PLACE MYSELF AT THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE RIGHT AND I PROPOSE IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED TO AN INVESTIGATION AND MAKE THE NECESSARY ARRESTS UPROAR FROM THE LEFT LISTEN TO ME HE CRIED IN A POWERFUL VOICE
THE LIEBER-DANS AND THE OTHER COMPROMISERS ARE SABOTAGING THE CONGRESS
I REPRODUCE AN EDITORIAL IN RABOTCHI I SOLDAT WORKER AND SOLDIER ORGAN OF THE BOLSHEVIK PETROGRAD SOVIET
BUT TO ME IT IS INCREDIBLE I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO TSARSKOYE SELO
ALL PERSONS WHO SUPPORT DUKHONIN WILL BE ARRESTED WITHOUT RESPECT TO THEIR SOCIAL OR POLITICAL POSITION OR THEIR PAST
4 BUKHARIN STOOD UP SAVAGE LOGICAL WITH A VOICE WHICH PLUNGED AND STRUCK PLUNGED AND STRUCK
THEREFORE THE BUND DELEGATES MUST REFUSE ANY LONGER TO SIT IN THE CONGRESS
THE SAILORS LET IT PASS
THE INEVITABILITY OF THEIR COMING INTO POWER BECAME EVIDENT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION
THE TIDE WAS TURNING
ON ME WEIGHS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THE ARTISTIC WEALTH OF THE PEOPLE
THE FEARFUL STRUGGLE THERE HAS REACHED A PITCH OF BESTIAL FEROCITY
WE CALL UPON ALL SANE ELEMENTS TO GATHER AROUND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION
NOGIN POPULAR EDUCATION A
IS THERE GOING TO BE ANY FIGHTING I ASKED
NO ONE PARTY CAN CONQUER THESE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES

C THOSE INCITING TO ACTS OF A CRIMINAL CHARACTER PUNISHABLE BY THE LAWS
ROUGHLY AND HASTILY THE THINGS WERE CRAMMED BACK IN THEIR CASES AND SELF-APPOINTED SENTINELS STOOD GUARD
WE CANNOT TAKE YOU TO MOSCOW WHERE ALREADY THERE IS TERRIBLE CIVIL WAR ALL THE SEETHING SQUARE ROARED AT HIM
HE LET THE BOLSHEVIKI KNOW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO BY ANNOUNCING IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC THAT HE HAD ORDERED THEIR ARREST
ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE RANKS OF THE PROLETARIAT TO BE DIVIDED
NEXT DAY HE TOOK TRAIN FOR THE SOUTH-WEST FRONT AND VISITED THE ARMY COMMITTEE AT HEADQUARTERS
NOGIN SPOKE AND MOST OF HIS LISTENERS WERE PLAINLY WITH HIM
THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE HELD OUT UNTIL AFTERNOON WHEN A BOLSHEVIK ARMOURED CAR APPEARED AND THE SAILORS STORMED THE PLACE
NO DELAY AND ABOVE THE HOT DISCUSSION ARGUMENT SHUFFLING OF FEET COULD BE HEARD THE VOICE OF AN EMISSARY OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CRYING FIFTEEN AGITATORS WANTED IN ROOM 17 AT ONCE
AND THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCES AND CONGRESSES DRAWING TOGETHER THE MEN OF TWO CONTINENTS--CONVENTIONS OF SOVIETS OF COOPERATIVES ZEMSTVOS,[5 NATIONALITIES PRIESTS PEASANTS POLITICAL PARTIES
ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE VOICES AND SOMEBODY LAUGHING
PROPOSE TO THE WARD SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES THE TRADE UNIONS THE FACTORY-SHOP AND PARTY COMMITTEES TO ORGANISE PROTEST MEETINGS
CONTRARY TO POPULAR REPORT YEDINSTVO WAS NOT SUPPRESSED BY THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
AVSEENKO ANTONOV N
FORWARD COSSACKS TO THE FIGHT FOR THE COMMON CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE
WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS YOU SHOULD FOLLOW EVERYWHERE THE EXAMPLE OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OF PETROGRAD
AFTER CIRCULATING ABOUT THE CITY THE CAR WENT BY DEVIOUS WAYS TO THE MIKHAILOVSKY YUNKER SCHOOL HEADQUARTERS OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION
AND THE GOVERNMENT SOLEMNLY PROCLAIMS ITS DECISION TO SIGN A TREATY OF PEACE WHICH WILL PUT AN END TO THIS WAR UPON THE ABOVE CONDITIONS EQUALLY FAIR FOR ALL NATIONALITIES WITHOUT EXCEPTION
WE CAN SEE IN THE NAKAZ OF THE SOVIETS THAT THE IDEAS OF THE STOCKHOLM MANIFESTO HAVE BEEN ELABORATED IN TWO DIRECTION--THAT OF UTOPIANISM AND THAT OF GERMAN INTERESTS INTERRUPTED BY THE ANGRY CRIES OF THE LEFT AND REBUKED BY THE PRESIDENT MILIUKOV INSISTED THAT THE PROPOSITION OF PEACE CONCLUDED BY POPULAR ASSEMBLIES NOT BY DIPLOMATS AND THE PROPOSAL TO UNDERTAKE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AS SOON AS THE ENEMY HAD RENOUNCED ANNEXATIONS WERE PRO-GERMAN
IN THE MORNING HOURS LATE WE LOOKED OUT UPON A SNOWY WORLD

HE NODDED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH A SORT OF BITTER SATISFACTION
MEANWHILE ONE BY ONE THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE WINNING IN THE LOCAL SOVIETS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN THE UNION BRANCHES AND THE RANKS OF THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
AND TROTZKY HAD ANSWERED THERE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY FOR THAT
THE ISOLATION OF RUSSIA WILL FATALLY RESULT EITHER IN THE DEFEAT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY BY THE GERMANS AND THE PATCHING UP OF A PEACE BETWEEN THE AUSTRO-GERMAN COALITION AND THE FRANCO-BRITISH COALITION AT THE EXPENSE OF RUSSIA_--OR IN A SEPARATE PEACE WITH GERMANY
WE HAVE NOT ONLY INVITED THE PEASANTS SOVIETS TO JOIN THAT GOVERNMENT BUT WE HAVE ALSO INVITED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES TO ENTER THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
HE WAS WITHOUT BOOTS OR CLOTHES
HOW IS IT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT ALMOST WITHOUT BLOODSHED
AND IN THAT CASE IT WILL MEAN A COMPLETE ABOLITION OF LANDLORD TYRANNY IMMEDIATE CHECK OF THE CAPITALISTS IMMEDIATE PROPOSAL OF A JUST PEACE
BECAUSE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNTIL THE RETURN OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO POWER AND THE RESTORATION OF ORDER IN RUSSIA I TAKE UPON MYSELF BEGINNING NOVEMBER 7TH ALL THE POWER IN THAT WHICH CONCERNS THE REGION OF THE DON
MEANWHILE THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO SOLVE THE PEACE QUESTION BY SIMPLY DESERTING THE PEASANTS BURNED MANOR-HOUSES AND TOOK OVER THE GREAT ESTATES THE WORKERS SABOTAGED AND STRUCK
DON'T BELIEVE THESE FALSE RUMOURS
EVERYTHING LIVING AND CAPABLE OF LIFE IS BEING EMANCIPATED FROM THE HATEFUL SHACKLES
THEY ARE STILL OUT IN THE HALL HE SAID CARELESSLY
ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS AND THE DARK SERVANTS OF THE TSAR AND THE SPIES OF WILHELM WILL EGG THE ON
ESPECIALLY IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN THE NEW AUTHORITY OF THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS IS IN PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LEAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AT A TIME WHEN IT IS NOT LESS DANGEROUS THAN BOMBS AND MACHINE-GUNS
DE L'AUDACE ENCORE DE L'AUDACE ET TOUJOURS DE L'AUDACE AT FIVE IN THE MORNING THE RED GUARDS ENTERED THE PRINTING OFFICE OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT CONFISCATED THOUSANDS OF COPIES OF THE APPEAL-PROTEST OF THE DUMA AND SUPPRESSED THE OFFICIAL MUNICIPAL ORGAN--THE VIESTNIK GORODSKOVO SAMOUPRAVLENIYA BULLETIN OF THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT ALL THE BOURGEOIS NEWSPAPERS WERE TORN FROM THE PRESSES EVEN THE GOLOS SOLDATA JOURNAL OF THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH_--WHICH HOWEVER CHANGING ITS NAME TO SOLDATSKI GOLOS APPEARED IN AN EDITION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES BELLOWING RAGE AND DEFIANCE
THEN THE TALK BESIDE WHICH CARLYLE'S FLOOD OF FRENCH SPEECH WAS A MERE TRICKLE
AT A LONG WOODEN TABLE WERE SEATED SOME TWENTY SOLDIERS EATING SHTCHI CABBAGE SOUP FROM A GREAT TIN WASH-TUB WITH WOODEN SPOONS AND TALKING LOUDLY WITH MUCH LAUGHTER
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STIFLING FULL OF SMOKE AND FOUL ODOURS
THE NAME OF TERESTCHENKO WAS GREETED WITH THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE SHOUTS OF SATISFACTION LAUGHTER
BUT SOME ONE CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO DATE AND NO SEAL AND THE TRADITIONAL RUSSIAN RESPECT FOR DOCUMENTS FORCED HIM AGAIN TO WITHDRAW
WE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHETHER THE SENTRIES WERE PRO-GOVERNMENT OR PRO-SOVIET
HOW MUCH TO THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
TO ALL PRINTING PLANTS IT GAVE ORDERS NOT TO PUBLISH ANY APPEALS OR PROCLAMATIONS WITHOUT THE COMMITTEE'S AUTHORISATION
NO MATTER WHAT ONE THINKS OF BOLSHEVISM IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION IS ONE OF THE GREAT EVENTS OF HUMAN HISTORY AND THE RISE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI A PHENOMENON OF WORLD-WIDE IMPORTANCE
2 BIRJEVYA VIEDOMOSTI EXCHANGE GAZETTE CALLED THE BOLSHEVIK PROPAGANDA AN ATTACK ON THE MOST ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF SOCIETY--PERSONAL SECURITY AND THE RESPECT FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY GRAPHIC PAGE 46
IN PRIVATE DWELLINGS AND APARTMENT-HOUSES THE ELECTRICITY WAS TURNED ON FROM SIX O'CLOCK UNTIL MIDNIGHT WITH CANDLES FORTY CENTS APIECE AND LITTLE KEROSENE TO BE HAD
I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED BY PEOPLE ARRIVING FROM MOSCOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE
SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF THE SPECIAL FOOD SUPPLY COMMITTEE HAD SUSPENDED WORK RATHER THAN SUBMIT TO THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE REVOLUTION IS IN DANGER AND WITH IT THE CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PROLETARIAT AND THE MIDDLE CLASS BETWEEN THE SOVIETS AND THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HAD BEGUN IN THE FIRST MARCH DAYS WAS ABOUT TO CULMINATE
100 MEMBERS OF WHICH 70 BOLSHEVIKI
SMALL PROPRIETORS DEPOSITORS AND STOCK-HOLDERS OF THE CONFISCATED ESTABLISHMENTS WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR ALL MONEYS HELD BY THEM IN THE CONCERN
SUPPORTING ITSELF MORALLY BY THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC THE GOVERNMENT MUST TAKE A CLEARLY-DEFINED ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE DARK PEOPLE IT WAS TRUE
THE SPECULATORS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE UNIVERSAL DISORGANISATION TO PILE UP FORTUNES AND TO SPEND THEM IN FANTASTIC REVELRY OR THE CORRUPTION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
HASTILY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO COMMAND THE DEFENCE OF PETROGRAD AN AMBITIOUS REGULAR ARMY CAPTAIN MURAVIOV THE SAME MURAVIOV WHO HAD ORGANISED THE DEATH BATTALIONS DURING THE SUMMER AND HAD ONCE BEEN HEARD TO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT THAT IT WAS TOO LENIENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
IN THIS WAY WAS UNEARTHED THE CONSPIRACY OF THE PETROGRAD CADETS WHO WERE SENDING MONEY AND RECRUITS TO KALEDIN
KAMENIEV WAS READING THE REPORT OF THE ACTIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
KORNILOVISTS
I WILL CITE HERE THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC PASSAGE FROM A WHOLE SERIES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN RABOTCHI PUT BY ULIANOV-LENIN A STATE CRIMINAL WHO IS IN HIDING AND WHOM WE ARE TRYING TO FIND
IN A MOMENT THE HALL WAS ONE BELLOWING MASS OF WAVING ARMS AND ANGRY FACES ON BOTH SIDES
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY WILL BE ON DUTY IN THE BUILDING OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA
THAT THE BRUNNOVIKI WITHDRAW THEIR REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND DECLARE THEIR NEUTRALITY IN THE PRESENT CIVIL WAR
THERE GREAT MASSES OF SHABBY SOLDIERS GRIMY WORKMEN PEASANTS--POOR MEN BENT AND SCARRED IN THE BRUTE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE
PROCLAMATION BOLSHEVIK ORDER
THE TRIAL OF KORNILOV WAS COMING ON
BUT THE BOLSHEVIKI WISH TO RETAIN THE POWER AND THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT
ALL BUILDINGS OFFICERS COUNTERS AND IN GENERAL EVERY ESTABLISHMENT DOING A BUSINESS IN ADVERTISING SHOULD IMMEDIATELY INFORM THE SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES OF ITS ADDRESS AND PROCEED TO THE TRANSFER OF ITS BUSINESS UNDER PENALTY OF THE PUNISHMENT INDICATED IN PARAGRAPH 5
IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGRARIAN AND SUPPLY DEPARTMENTS THE POLITICS OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES ACTING WITH THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES THE NATURAL DISORGANISATION CAUSED BY THE WAR
ARGUING SOLDIERS AND STUDENTS
BUT LENIN WON'T GET GERMANY TO MAKE PEACE CRIED ONE
ON THE ORDER IN WHICH LAWS ARE TO BE RATIFIED AND PUBLISHED ESTABLISHING AN EIGHT HOUR DAYS FOR WORKERS AND LUNATCHARSKY'S BASIS FOR A SYSTEM OF POPULAR EDUCATION ONLY A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE PRESENT AT THE TWO MEETINGS MOST OF THEM ARMED
THE BOLSHEVIKI IN GENERAL TOOK THE CORRECT ATTITUDE TOWARD THE LAND QUESTION
BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN DEFINITE THINGS FOR WHICH THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION HAD BEEN MADE AND FOR WHICH THE REVOLUTIONARY MARTYRS ROTTED IN THEIR STARK BROTHERHOOD GRAVE ON MARS FIELD THAT MUST BE ACHIEVED CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OR NO CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE SAVAGES SET UP GODS TO WHICH THEY PRAY AND WHICH THEY PUNISH IF ONE OF THEIR PRAYERS IS NOT ANSWERED
THEN THE UNDESIRABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY DESERTERS ETC AND FINALLY BY DRAWING LOTS ON AGREEMENT
BY 11-12 P.M TSARKOYE SELO INCLUDING THE WIRELESS STATION WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED BY THE TROOPS OF THE SOVIETS
AND THE PROCESSION POURED IN THROUGH THE GREAT DOOR AND UP THE STAIRS WITH A NOISE LIKE THUNDER
LONG LIVE IMMEDIATE HONEST DEMOCRATIC PEACE
IN AN HOUR WE HAD SOME OFFICERS AND A COUPLE OF MINISTERS WHOM WE SENT UP TO SMOLNY RIGHT AWAY
SO WAS THE CHAUFFEUR
THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE ADMITTED IN A LARGE MINORITY BUT LENIN AND TROTZKY WERE BARRED
YOU HERE STILL THE SPEAKER EXPLAINED THAT ONLY PART OF THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS LEFT THE CONGRESS
IN THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER 3D 160 MEN SURRENDERED
IN ACCORD WITH THE PROPOSALS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND ALL THE DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS UNITED AROUND IT I HAVE HALTED ALL MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE REBELS
THEY ARE GOING TO CAPTURE THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE SAID SOME ONE
THEY HAVE STARTED CIVIL WAR AND OPENED THE FRONT TO THE GERMANS
MARTOV MARTINOV
ANOTHER TUB FULL OF KASHA WAS BROUGHT IN A HUGE LOAF OF BLACK BREAD AND OF COURSE THE INEVITABLE TEA-POTS
ONE AFTER ANOTHER A WORKMAN A SOLDIER AND A SAILOR TOOK THE FLOOR HAILING THEM
BUT THEY ARE ALSO THIRSTING FOR EDUCATION
AT THE SAME TIME THE FINNISH RAILWAY UNION CALLED A COUNTRYWIDE GENERAL STRIKE TO PUT INTO OPERATION THE LAWS PASSED BY THE SOCIALIST DIET OF JUNE 1917 DISSOLVED BY KERENSKY
JOIN WITH THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
THE TROOPS ARE IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS
THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
THE BOY JUST LAUGHED AT HIM AND A CROWD OF PEOPLE WANTED TO LYNCH THE BANDIT
WHEN KORNILOV MARCHED ON PETROGRAD THEY REFUSED TO FOLLOW HIM
IT MUST BE APPROVED BY THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND CARRIED OUT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THESE REPRESENTATIVES BY MEANS OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL ORGANISATIONS
CHAPTER 6
WE WILL MARCH ON WHETHER YOU PERMIT US OR NOT CRIED OLD SCHREIDER VERY MUCH EXCITED
SEND ME YOUR DELEGATES SO THAT I MAY KNOW WHO ARE TRAITORS TO THEIR COUNTRY AND WHO ARE NOT THAT THERE MAY BE AVOIDED AN EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD
GOTZ IS A LITTLE MORE RADICAL
THIS CONFERENCE HAD BEEN PROMISED FOR AUGUST
HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT NIGHT THERE WAS GREAT UNEASINESS IN THE CONFERENCE
THERE WAS A TRUCE AND THEY STARTED FOR THE FRONT TRENCHES
DO NOT BE MISTAKEN
THE STRIKE FUND THE FUND FOR THE STRIKING GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND BANK CLERKS WAS SUBSCRIBED BY BANKS AND BUSINESS HOUSES OF PETROGRAD AND OTHER CITIES AND ALSO BY FOREIGN CORPORATIONS DOING BUSINESS IN RUSSIA
HOWEVER IT WOULD BE A CRIME FOR US NOT TO TRY EVERY PEACEFUL MEANS TO BRING THE COSSACKS OVER TO US
ALONG ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE STREETS WERE FULL OF SUBDUED OLD GENTLEMEN IN UNIFORM WITH PORTFOLIOS GOING HOME FROM WORK IN THE HUGE BARRACK-LIKE MINISTRIES OR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS CALCULATING PERHAPS HOW GREAT A MORTALITY AMONG THEIR SUPERIORS WOULD ADVANCE THEM TO THE COVETED TCHIN RANK OF COLLEGIATE ASSESSOR OR PRIVY COUNCILLOR WITH THE PROSPECT OF RETIREMENT ON A COMFORTABLE PENSION AND POSSIBLY THE CROSS OF ST ANNE
THE PRIVATE BANKS REMAINED STUBBORNLY CLOSED WITH A BACK DOOR OPEN FOR SPECULATORS
THE HOUR OF RESOLUTIONS HAS PASSED
AND AT THAT PERFORMANCE I REMEMBER NOTICING A STUDENT OF THE IMPERIAL SCHOOL OF PAGES IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM WHO STOOD UP CORRECTLY BETWEEN THE ACTS AND FACED THE EMPTY IMPERIAL BOX WITH ITS EAGLES ALL ERASED
THE DELEGATES FROM THE PEASANTS SOVIETS SHALL BE ELECTED BY THE CONGRESS OF PEASANTS WHICH WE HAVE CALLED AND WHICH WILL AT THE SAME TIME ELECT A NEW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
MOGHILEV GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS CONCENTRATION HERE OF LOYAL GUARD REGIMENTS THE SAVAGE DIVISION COSSACKS AND DEATH BATTALIONS
ON THE SECOND NIGHT OF THE CONGRESS AN ANONYMOUS NOTE WAS HANDED UP TO THE CHAIRMAN REQUESTING THAT TCHERNOV BE MADE HONORARY PRESIDENT
AGAINST THEM NOT ONLY THE ORGANISED BOURGEOISIE BUT ALL THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES EXCEPT THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES A FEW MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT INTERNATIONALISTS AND EVEN THEY UNDECIDED WHETHER TO STAND BY OR NOT
SMOLNY WAS ALREADY ABANDONED
AMID BEDLAM FROM THE LEFT HE CONTRASTED THE CLAUSES OF THE NAKAZ CONCERNING ALSACE-LORRAINE RUMANIA AND SERBIA WITH THOSE TREATING OF THE NATIONALITIES IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA
IS IT THIS THAT YOU WANT WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
THIS IS NATURAL SAID THE WRITER
SEE
BRRR IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THE SNOW-PILED STREETS WERE QUIET WITH THE STILLNESS OF CONVALESCENCE
IT IS DIRECT TREASON TO RUSSIA
WE HOPE THAT THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS WILL TAKE
I HEARD ONE VOICE SAYING
THE TRIUMPHANT COUNTER-REVOLUTION WILL DESTROY THE SOVIETS AND THE ARMY COMMITTEES WILL DISPERSE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL STOP THE TRANSFER OF THE LAND TO THE LAND COMMITTEES WILL PUT AN END TO ALL THE HOPES OF THE PEOPLE FOR A SPEEDY PEACE AND WILL FILL ALL THE PRISONS WITH REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS AND WORKERS
2.10 A.M
THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IS BAD BUT WE MUST GET USED TO IT
THAT IS A DECLARATION OF PITILESS WAR
BUNGLERS BUNGLERS TO DEFEAT KORNILOV
I DO NOT THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE UP ADVANCED POSITIONS
MANY LOCAL SOVIETS WERE ALREADY BOLSHEVIK
THE NEARER WE CAME TO THE IMPERIAL PARK THE MORE DESERTED WERE THE STREETS
KERENSKY DECLINED TO OBEY AND THREATENED TO RESIGN FROM THE CABINET IF THE SOCIALISTS INSISTED
DECREE ON SOCIAL INSURANCE ON WORKERS CONTROL REGULATIONS FOR VOLOST LAND COMMITTEES ABOLITION OF RANKS AND TITLES ABOLITION OF COURTS AND THE CREATION OF PEOPLE'S TRIBUNALS
THIS WAS AGREED TO
TAKE ALL MEASURES TO STOP THE USELESS SHEDDING OF BLOOD
FOLLOWED A HOT DISCUSSION
MOST OF THE YUNKERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED ANYWAY AND THE REST WILL GO OUT TO-MORROW HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AWAY
IN THE NAME OF THE COUNCIL L
THOSE GUILTY OF THE DISTRIBUTION SALE OR PURCHASE OF ANY KIND OF ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR AND ALSO THOSE GUILTY OF THE VIOLATION OF SECTIONS 2 AND 4 WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED AND SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT
THAT UNION CRUSHING ALL ATTEMPTS DIRECT OR INDIRECT OPEN OR DISSIMULATED TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF CONCILIATION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE--CONCILIATION DAMNED BY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHIEFS OF BOURGEOIS POLITICS--CAN ALONE INSURE THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING IN HIS BOOK RUSSIA'S MESSAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 DESCRIBES VERY WELL THE STATE OF MIND OF THE RUSSIAN WORKERS WHO WERE LATER TO SUPPORT BOLSHEVISM ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY
WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE KOLLONTAI ARRESTED THE STRIKERS UNTIL THEY SHOULD DELIVER THE KEYS OF THE OFFICE AND THE SAFE
THE CENTRAL DUMA IS FORMING A POWERFUL COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION TO FIGHT YOU
THESE AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS CANNOT BE ANSWERED HERE
AS WE LEFT THE DUMA BUILDING TWO BOY SCOUTS WERE DISTRIBUTING HAND-BILLS SEE APP
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET HE DECLARED HAD NOT ORDERED ANY UYSTUPLENNIE IF IT IS NECESSARY WE SHALL DO SO AND WE WILL BE SUPPORTED BY THE PETROGRUAD GARRISON
THE TSAY-EE-KAH HAS FULL POWER TO ACT AND MUST BE OBEYED
IN ANSWER THIS PLACARD ON ALL THE WALLS
THIS WAS MET BY A THUNDER OF APPLAUSE NOT ONLY FROM THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES BUT ALSO FROM A PART OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE PETERHOF YUNKERS UNABLE TO REACH PETROGRAD
IT IS NECESSARY TO DO BATTLE WITH IT AND TO PULL IT DOWN
IN SEPTEMBER 1917 MATTERS REACHED A CRISIS
I AM STEPAN GEORGEVITCH MOROVSKY AT YOUR SERVICE SAID THE LIEUTENANT IN PERFECT FRENCH
HE IS IN PETROGRAD TO-NIGHT
IF THE MASSES ALL OVER RUSSIA HAD NOT BEEN READY FOR INSURRECTION IT MUST HAVE FAILED
DR MANDELBAUM ANOTHER OF THE COMMISSION TESTIFIED DRILY THAT NONE OF THE WOMEN HAD BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE WINDOWS OF THE WINTER PALACE THAT NONE WERE WOUNDED THAT THREE HAD BEEN VIOLATED AND THAT ONE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE LEAVING A NOTE WHICH SAID THAT SHE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN HER IDEALS ON NOVEMBER 21ST THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE OFFICIALLY DISSOLVED THE WOMEN'S BATTALION AT THE REQUEST OF THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WHO RETURNED TO CIVILIAN CLOTHES
THAT NIGHT THEY ALSO TOUCHED PULKOVO WHERE THE FIRST REAL RESISTANCE WAS ENCOUNTERED
ARREST THEM
WHY NOT HE MUTTERED
POWERLESS TO DIRECT THE EXISTING MECHANISM OF GOVERNMENT THEY ARE UNABLE AT THE SAME TIME TO CREATE A NEW ONE WHICH MIGHT WORK EASILY AND FREELY ACCORDING TO THE THEORIES OF SOCIAL EXPERIMENTERS
IN PETROGRAD SIXTEEN MINISTRIES WERE ON STRIKE LED BY THE MINISTRIES OF LABOUR AND OF SUPPLIES--THE ONLY TWO CREATED BY THE ALL-SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT OF AUGUST
HOLA HOLA ENGLAND FRANCE GERMANY
THIS DECREE IS PROMULGATED BY TELEGRAPH
AND THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES REALISING THAT THEY WERE DEFEATED SUDDENLY CHANGED THEIR TACTICS AND BEGAN TO WIRE FRANTICALLY TO THEIR PROVINCIAL ORGANISATIONS TO ELECT AS MANY MODERATE SOCIALIST DELEGATES AS POSSIBLE
THERE WAS ONLY A FAINT UNEARTHLY PALLOR STEALING OVER THE SILENT STREETS DIMMING THE WATCH-FIRES THE SHADOW OF A TERRIBLE DAWN GREY-RISING OVER RUSSIA
THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPERS SUPPRESSED ONE DAY AND REAPPEARING NEXT MORNING UNDER NEW NAMES HEAPED BITTER SARCASM ON THE NEW REGIME
WE OURSELVES ARE BEING CALLED THE UNDERTAKERS OF OUR OWN ORGANISATION
WHY DID THE PEOPLE STAND IT
BOMBARD THE KREMLIN CRIED THE ORDINARY CITIZEN
4 WE CAME OUT INTO THE COLD NERVOUS NIGHT MURMUROUS WITH OBSCURE ARMIES ON THE MOVE ELECTRIC WITH PATROLS
RODZIANKO IS A MAN OF ACTION WHO HAS FAITHFULLY AND TRUTHFULLY SERVED THE BOURGEOISIE FOR YEARS
SEE THEY SAID
FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES THESE WERE SPONTANEOUS ORGANISATIONS CREATED IN THE FACTORIES BY THE WORKERS IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO CONTROL INDUSTRY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BREAK-DOWN INCIDENT UPON THE REVOLUTION
SOME SOLDIERS WERE TRYING TO FASTEN TWO MILITARY BICYCLES ON THE RUNNING-BOARD
AFTER FORTY MONTHS OF WAR THE CAPITAL IS THREATENED WITH MORTAL DANGER
WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO DISPOSE OF OUR STORAGES WHERE THE SELF-APPOINTED COMMISSARS DO NOT ALLOW THE CARGOES TO BE TAKEN OUT AND TERRORISE OUR EMPLOYEES THREATENING THEM WITH ARREST
THEN THE LAND IS ASSURED TO THE PEASANTS THEN CONTROL OF INDUSTRY IS ASSURED TO THE WORKERS THEN BREAD IS ASSURED TO THE HUNGRY THEN THE END OF THIS NONSENSICAL WAR
AS LOUISE BRYANT WAS GOING ALONG ST ISAAC'S SQUARE ONE CAME ROLLING UP FROM THE ADMIRALTY ON ITS WAY TO THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
FROM THE FIRST DAYS THE BOLSHEVIKI DECLARED THAT THE PEASANTS SHOULD TAKE OVER THE LAND BY REVOLUTIONARY MASS ACTION THIS IS NOTHING BUT ANARCHY
THE GENERALS OF THE BLACK BAND HENCHMEN OF THE LAND-OWNERS OF NICOLAI THE CRUEL ARE OUR ENEMIES
TO TAKE SERIOUS MEASURES TO BE READY AT THE FIRST CALL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PARTY TO ACT AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS WHO WILL DOUBTLESS ATTEMPT TO PROFIT BY THESE TROUBLES PROVOKED BY THE BOLSHEVIK ADVENTURE AND TO WATCH CLOSELY THE EXTERNAL ENEMY WHO ALSO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNE MOMENT WHEN THE FRONT IS WEAKENED THE MILITARY SECTION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY FROM PRAVDA WHAT IS KERENSKY
IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE SESSION STUNNED BY THE RAPIDITY OF EVENTS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF CANNON THE DELEGATES HAD HESITATED
WHY DID THEY DARE LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT
I DON'T KNOW TIMIDLY THE SOLDIER PUT OUT HIS HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR A CRACK
HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOING TO WALK OUT THEN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS
A SHORT TIME LATER AN OFFICER CAME AND SET THEM FREE SAYING THAT IT WAS BY ORDER OF GENERAL KRASNOV
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE EXPECTS THE SUPPORT OF ALL TO WHOM THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE DEAR
PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE WE CROSSED BACK OVER TO THE LEFT ENTRANCE IN THE WEST WING
THEN THE FRONT DOOR OPENED A CRACK AND A WOMAN'S FACE APPEARED
THE FRENCH EMBASSY PROMPTLY DENIED THIS BUT ONE OF THE CITY COUNCILLORS TOLD ME THAT HE HIMSELF HAD PROCURED THE OFFICER'S RELEASE FROM PRISON
BUT THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE SOLDIERS SHAKING HIS FIST
KAMENIEV FROM THE PLATFORM SHOUTED AFTER THEM THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS CLAIMED EMERGENCY FOR THE QUESTION OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION BUT THEY ALWAYS VOTED FOR SUSPENSION OF THE ORDER OF THE DAY IN FAVOUR OF DECLARATIONS OF FACTIONS WHICH WANTED TO LEAVE THE CONGRESS
A DECLARATION CONFORMING TO THIS DECISION HAS BEEN SENT BY THE COMMISSAR FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ALLIED POWERS AT PETROGRAD
TSERETELLI DAN AND LIEBER AT THE HEAD OF THE RIGHT WING MENSHEVIKI AND THE RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES UNDER AVKSENTIEV AND GOTZ INSISTED THAT THE PROPERTIED CLASSES MUST BE REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT
LET ME SEE THE COMMANDANT HE SAID
WE WILL PROTEST AGAINST MASSACRES AND VIOLENCE FROM BOTH SIDES AS OUR TASK IS TO FIND A PEACEFUL ISSUE THE NOTICE POSTED IN THE STREETS UNDER THE HEADING TO THE PILLORY WHICH CALLS UPON THE PEOPLE TO DESTROY THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SAID NAZARIEV IS A CRIME WHICH YOU BOLSHEVIKI WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WASH AWAY
THE 1ST OF JULY OFFENSIVE WAS BENEFICIAL AND A VERY HAPPY AFFAIR
THE 5TH OF SEPTEMBER TO MAKE AN END OF THE AFFAIR A HEAVY BARRAGE WAS LAID ON THE CAMP AND OUR SOLDIERS OCCUPIED IT LITTLE BY LITTLE
THE ARMY SERVING THE WILL OF THE TOILING PEOPLE IS SUBJECT TO ITS SUPREME REPRESENTATIVE--THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
A MURDERER OF SOLDIERS
OFFICERS WHO DO NOT FRANKLY AND OPENLY DECLARE FOR THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED AS ENEMIES
SUDDENLY AWAKE TO THE DANGER THE GOVERNMENT OFFERED IMMUNITY IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD DISBAND
AT NIGHT FOR MOTIVES OF ECONOMY AS WELL AS FEAR OF ZEPPELINS THE STREET-LIGHTS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
THE FRENCH NEWSPAPER ENTENTE OF PETROGRAD ON NOVEMBER 15TH PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE OF WHICH THE FOLLOWING IS A PART
WHEN AS A MATTER OF FACT THESE CALAMITIES SPRING FROM OBJECTIVE CAUSES
IN MARCH YOU STRUCK DOWN THE TYRANNY OF THE CLIQUE OF NOBLES
BUT AS LENIN HIMSELF TOLD THE TSAY-EE-KAH THAT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE CONQUEST OF POWER DEPRIVED OF ARMS THE OPPOSITION WHICH STILL CONTROLLED THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE COUNTRY SETTLED DOWN TO ORGANISE DISORGANISATION WITH ALL THE RUSSIAN GENIUS FOR COOPERATIVE ACTION--TO OBSTRUCT CRIPPLE AND DISCREDIT THE SOVIETS
THE SOLDIERS WERE DRAWN UP BEFORE THE GREAT GATES THIN AND GREY-FACED LOOKING UP AT THE BUILDING AS IF GOD WERE IN IT
FROM THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE FROM THE SPECIAL SUPPLY COMMITTEE DECLARATIONS THAT THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO WORK APPEALS TO THE POPULATION TO SUPPORT THEM AGAINST SMOLNY
THE INTERNATIONALE IS AN ALIEN AIR AFTER ALL
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE NOT A SESSION CRIED TCHERNOV AND HE LEFT THE HALL
THE END OF THE WAR WILL LEAVE US IN A FEEBLE CONDITION AND WITH OUR FRONTIER OPEN THE FLOOD OF GERMAN PRODUCTS CAN EASILY HOLD BACK FOR YEARS OUR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
TROTZKY AS A SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC THEORIST IS HIMSELF OPPOSED TO WHAT HE IS NOW ADVOCATING CRIES ENOUGH
WOMEN WITH SPADES SOME WITH RIFLES AND BANDOLEERS OTHERS WEARING THE RED CROSS ON THEIR ARM-BANDS--THE BOWED TOIL-WORN WOMEN OF THE SLUMS
THE PLACE TO FIGHT IS OUT ON THE STREETS IMMENSE BAWLING OUTCRY
THEIR METHODS ARE INTOLERABLE
A CRIMINAL AND A TRAITOR TO THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WHO BELIEVED IN HIM
POLITICAL PASSION IS RUNNING VERY HIGH IN TSARSKOYE SELO
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT OF PARTICULAR HISTORICAL VALUE
IN ALL THE GREAT CITY NOT A HUMAN BEING COULD BE SEEN
AS FAR AS THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS CONCERNED IT IS TRUE AS THE PRECEDING SPEAKER HAS SAID THAT THE WORK OF THE CONSTITUENT WILL DEPEND ON THE REVOLUTIONARY DETERMINATION OF THE MASSES
I ORDERED THE PULKOVO FORCES TO OCCUPY TSARSKOYE SELO TO FORTIFY ITS APPROACHES ESPECIALLY ON THE SIDE OF GATCHINA
THE RESPONSE FROM THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS LIKE A BLAST OF HOT STORM
IF THEY HAD WAITED FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY BROKE IN THE OFFICER
| 1233 | | CLOTH | | | | | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | DRESS GOODS | ARSHIN | 2
ON THE STREETS THE CROWDS THICKENED TOWARD GLOOMY EVENING POURING IN SLOW VOLUBLE TIDES UP AND DOWN THE NEVSKY FIGHTING FOR THE NEWSPAPERS
OUTSIDE OF THAT HOWEVER ONE WOULD NEVER HAVE REALISED THAT CIVIL WAR WAS RENDING MIGHTY RUSSIA IN TWO AND THAT THE TRAIN WAS HEADED INTO THE ZONE OF BATTLE
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THIS MOMENT
ON ITS PART THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT IGNORE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE BOLSHEVIK PROPAGANDA
AT THE SAME TIME ACCORDING TO OUR PROMISE WE SHALL PUBLISH AND REPUDIATE THE SECRET TREATIES
ALL ASSEMBLIES MEETINGS AND CONGREGATIONS ON THE STREETS AND SQUARES ARE PROHIBITED
ON EVERY CORNER IMMENSE CROWDS WERE MASSED AROUND A CORE OF HOT DISCUSSION
THE COUNTRY WILL KNOW THE TRUTH
I CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR IT AT ALL HE SAID GRIMACING WITH THE PAIN OF HIS INTELLECTUAL PROCESSES
IT IS A PROVOCATOR
THE GROWTH OF NATIONAL ENMITY THE IMPAIRMENT OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE
NOT BY COMPROMISE WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES OR WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL LEADERS
ON OCTOBER 28TH IN THE CORRIDORS OF SMOLNY I SPOKE WITH KAMENIEV A LITTLE MAN WITH A REDDISH POINTED BEARD AND GALLIC GESTURES
WE WON'T LET THEM
WE AFFIRM THAT IT WAS MERELY A PRIVATE CONFERENCE OF THE BOLSHEVIK FACTION
AT THE FIRST HOTEL WE ENTERED AN OFFICE ILLUMINATED BY TWO CANDLES
THROUGH THE DULL HEAVY SKY NOW AND AGAIN BURST THE SUN FLOODING REDDISH LIGHT THROUGH THE SKELETON WINDOWS UPON THE MASS OF SIMPLE FACES UPTURNED TO US
ALL TREATIES UNTIL CONFIRMED BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS ARE TO BE CONSIDERED VOID
PROTESTS ARE OF NO USE KOBOZEV BOLSHEVIK MEMBER OF THE TOWN BOARD WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAD REQUISITIONED THE MUNICIPAL AUTOMOBILES
HE MUST STUDY THE ASPECTS OF THE AGRARIAN PROBLEM IN THE PROVINCE
DOWN WITH THE WAR
YOU SEE I'M A FOLLOWER OF KROPOTKIN
AS WE WENT MY COMPANION DESCRIBED HIS ANCIENT REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES HIS LONG AND PLEASANT EXILE IN FRANCE
THE COMMISSARS WHO ARRESTED THEM ARE TO BE ARRESTED
BUT THE CHAUFFEUR'S PROFESSIONAL PRIDE WAS REVOLTED
SEALS HAVE BEEN AFFIXED TO ONE OF THE COLD STORAGES WHERE THE MEAT AND BUTTER DESTINED FOR THE POPULATION ARE KEPT AND WE CANNOT REGULATE THE TEMPERATURE SO THAT THE PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE SPOILT
NERATOV HIDES UNDER THE BED--AND TROTZKY HAS HIM
YES YES I KNOW YOU THINK SO ANSWERED KARELIN HOTLY
TRUCKS BOUND BOTH WAYS BRISTLING WITH ARMED MEN
WE RENOUNCE OUR TITLE AS MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SAY OPENLY OUR OPINION TO THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
ON THE NEVSKY ALL THE STREET-LIGHTS WERE AGAIN SHINING THE CANNON GONE AND THE ONLY SIGNS OF WAR WERE RED GUARDS AND SOLDIERS SQUATTING AROUND FIRES
HIS PARTY THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ORDERED HIM TO EXCLUDE THE CADETS
COMRADES APPEALED THE OFFICER SWEAT STANDING OUT ON HIS FOREHEAD
HE BECKONED TO AN APPROACHING OFFICER WHO GREW VERY AGITATED WHEN HE SAW WHO IT WAS AND SALUTED BEFORE HE REALISED WHAT HE WAS DOING
I WILL TELL YOU
WE ARE HATED BY ALL GRAFTERS RICH MEN PRINCES NOBLES GENERALS INCLUDING YOUR COSSACK GENERALS
8 IN ITALIA IRRIDENTA A PROVISIONAL AUTONOMY FOLLOWED BY A PLEBISCITE TO DETERMINE STATE DEPENDENCE
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY MUST FOLLOW THE SOLDIER-MASSES DINNER OVER MAPS WERE BROUGHT AND THE COLONEL SPREAD THEM OUT ON THE TABLE
THEY SAY THAT THEY CONDEMN OUR ACTION BUT THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT ATTACKS US THEY WILL NOT OPPOSE THE CAUSE OF THE PROLETARIAT EXULTANT SHOUTING
WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF THREATS
IN BARRACKS HE MUST ASK OUR PERMISSION BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION
NOT SO NOISY POPULAR ORGANISATIONS 1
THIS DECREE SHALL BE PROMULGATED BY TELEGRAPH
IN THE CAPITAL THE GOVERNMENT AND BANK EMPLOYEES GOT OUT HUNDREDS OF PROCLAMATIONS AND APPEALS SEE APP
SMALL FORCES OF BOLSHEVIKI HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH OFFICES
IS SUCH A CONDITION FAIR
IN ELOQUENT PROCLAMATIONS SEE APP
RESOLUTION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MAYOR OR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DUMA TO ENTER INTO ANY RELATIONS WHATEVER WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE OR WITH THE SO-CALLED COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
DAN GOTZ AVKESNTIEV WERE THERE SOME OF THE INSURGENT SOVIET DELEGATES MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS OLD PROKOPOVITCH AND EVEN MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC--AMONG WHOM VINAVER AND OTHER CADETS
THE CITY IS BOUND TO SHOW HOSPITALITY TO ALL ORGANISATIONS WHICH DESIRE TO PROFIT BY SUCH HOSPITALITY AND THEREFORE THE DUMA CANNOT PREVENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANY NEWSPAPERS WHATEVER WITHIN THE DUMA BUILDING
ALERT AND SUSPICIOUS THE WORKING-CLASS OF THE CITY CONSTITUTED ITSELF A VAST SPY SYSTEM THROUGH THE SERVANTS PRYING INTO BOURGEOIS HOUSEHOLDS AND REPORTING ALL INFORMATION TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHICH STRUCK WITH AN IRON HAND UNCEASING
YOU HAVE HAD POLITICS ALL YOUR LIVES
OFTEN THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT TURNED AROUND AND BEGAN TO HELP GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE COMRADES
CHAPTER 7
TWO HOURS LATER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS WAS SENDING BROADCAST OVER RUSSIA THE FOLLOWING TELEGRAM
TO EXPRESS FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS AND TO PROMISE THEM COMPLETE SUPPORT AT THE SAME TIME THE MEETING DEEMS IT NECESSARY THAT THE COMRADES LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SHOULD ENTER THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT 7

THE GARRISON IS TURNING HE MUTTERED IN MY EAR
EVEN NOW A COMMITTEE FROM THE DUMA WAS MAKING THE ROUNDS OF BUSINESS HOUSES COLLECTING A FUND TO PAY THE SALARIES OF THE STRIKERS
BUT IS IT WE WHO ARE TO BLAME
FOR IT WAS SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN ALL RUSSIA BATHES AND PERFUMES ITSELF
KERENSKY HIMSELF FORCED US TO ACCEPT COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE
WHOEVER KEEPS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ORDER FROM THE SOLDIER-MASSES
ALREADY THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ARE INCLINED TO ADMIT US INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT HE TOLD ME
AH YOU MEAN THE CHEST
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION THE COSSACKS REFUSED TO SHOOT DOWN THE PEOPLE
IF SOCIALISM CAN ONLY BE REALISED WHEN THE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE PERMITS IT THEN WE SHALL NOT SEE SOCIALISM FOR AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
A DOZEN MEN OFFICERS CHAIRMEN OF THE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES AND SPEAKERS WERE PERCHED ON TOP OF THE CAR AND FROM THE CENTRAL TURRET A SOLDIER WAS SPEAKING
SOME POINTED OUT THE IMPERIAL EAGLES OVER THE DOOR LAUGHING
TO WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES HAS OPENED
ALL OTHERS ARE SURRENDERED BY THE YUNKERS THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GUARANTEES THE LIBERTY AND INVIOLABILITY OF THE PERSON
THEN OPENED THE TRIUMPHAL SESSION AFTER A FEW WORDS OF WELCOME FROM SVERDLOV MARIA SPIRIDONOVA SLIGHT PALE WITH SPECTACLES AND HAIR DRAWN FLATLY DOWN AND THE AIR OF A NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL-TEACHER TOOK THE TRIBUNE--THE MOST LOVED AND THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN IN ALL RUSSIA
OUR COALITION IS THAT OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WITH THE POOR PEASANTS
SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS GOING ON AROUND THE MARINSKY PALACE WHERE THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC MET
W

THERE IS CONTRADICTION HERE HE SAID
CITIZENS ARISE
THESE COMRADES WHO ARE NOW CAUGHT PLOTTING THE CRUSHING OF THE SOVIETS WITH THE ADVENTURER KERENSKY--IS THERE ANY REASON TO HANDLE THEM WITH GLOVES
ON THE KIROTCHNAYA WE TURNED INTO AN IMMENSE COURTYARD SURROUNDED BY MILITARY BUILDINGS AND MOUNTED A DARK STAIRWAY TO A LOW ROOM LIT BY ONE WINDOW
THAT RELATING TO INDUSTRY TRADE AND TRANSPORT OPERATED BY WAGE-EARNERS BY MEANS OF WORKERS CONTROL
THE MASSES OF THE WORKERS THE SOLDIERS OF THE GARRISON STIRRED RESTLESSLY SENDING THEIR DELEGATIONS TO SMOLNY TO THE CONFERENCE FOR FORMATION OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT WHERE THE BREAK IN THE RANKS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI CAUSED THE LIVELIEST JOY
BEHIND THE DEAD CAME OTHER WOMEN--WOMEN YOUNG AND BROKEN OR OLD WRINKLED WOMEN MAKING NOISES LIKE HURT ANIMALS WHO TRIED TO FOLLOW THEIR SONS AND HUSBANDS INTO THE BROTHERHOOD GRAVE AND SHRIEKED WHEN COMPASSIONATE HANDS RESTRAINED THEM
BY A VAST MAJORITY LENIN'S POLICY WAS SUSTAINED AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE TOLD THAT THEY MUST ENTER THE GOVERNMENT
AND AT ONCE TEN THOUSAND TROOPS MOVED UPON MOGHILEV
THE LONG TABLE COVERED WITH GREEN BAIZE WAS JUST AS THEY HAD LEFT IT UNDER ARREST
7 SAID HE CALMLY BUT WITH SATISFACTION
MY NAME IS TROTZKY HE REPEATED
KERENSKY HELD THE TOWN
THEY WELCOMED US WITH GREAT CORDIALITY OFFERING TEA
THIS STATE CRIMINAL HAS INVITED THE PROLETARIAT AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON TO REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE 16TH-18TH OF JULY AND INSISTS UPON THE IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN ARMED RISING
FIRST THE APPEAL OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION FLUNG BROADCAST OVER RUSSIA AND EUROPE
ALREADY A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WAS FUNCTIONING
COST OF OTHER NECESSITIES_--(_RUBLES AND KOPEKS +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | | AUGUST 1914 | AUGUST | | | | | | 1917 | INCREASE | | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | CALICO | ARSHIN | 11 | 1.40 | 1173 | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | COTTON | ARSHIN | 15 | 2
IN THE ALLIED CONFERENCE WE MUST ALL SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE AND IS THAT ALL
THERE WERE NO POPES TO OFFICIATE AT THE RED BURIAL THERE HAD BEEN NO SACRAMENT FOR THE DEAD NOR WERE ANY PRAYERS TO BE SAID OVER THE GRAVE OF THE BLASPHEMERS
AT 1.35 THE POST OFFICE WAS OCCUPIED
I OUGHT TO COMMIT SUICIDE IF YOU ARE AN HONORABLE MAN YOU WILL GO IMMEDIATELY TO PETROGRAD WITH A WHITE FLAG YOU WILL PRESENT YOURSELF TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS AS CHIEF OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ALL RIGHT
OF ALL THE PARTIES NOW SUPPORTING THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE THE LOGICAL INHERITORS OF PEASANT LEADERSHIP--AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHO WERE AT THE MERCY OF THE ORGANISED CITY PROLETARIAT DESPERATELY NEEDED THE BACKING OF THE PEASANTS
AS LONG AGO AS 1905 THE PROCESS HAD BEGUN
CITIZENS STOPPED EACH OTHER ON THE STREET
IN FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY RESPONSIBILITY AND MY DUTY BEFORE MY COUNTRY I COMMAND
FIVE OR SIX SAILORS WITH RIFLES CAME ALONG LAUGHING EXCITEDLY AND FELL INTO CONVERSATION WITH TWO OF THE SOLDIERS
THE COSSACKS UNDECIDED
WHEN I ASKED HIM IF THE INSURRECTION HAD REALLY HAPPENED HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN A TIRED MANNER AND REPLIED TCHORT ZNAYET THE DEVIL KNOWS
KERENSKY LEFT FOR THE FRONT
OUR REVOLUTION WILL REMAIN THE CLASSIC REVOLUTION OF HISTORY
FIRING ON THE PALACE BEGAN ABOUT 7 O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
ON AN AVERAGE WAGES INCREASED SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 500 PER CENT
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS STOOD AROUND EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR SOMETHING
THIS MORNING HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT HALF A KILOMETER DOWN THE ROAD
NOW IN THE BACKGROUND OF RUSSIAN POLITICS BEGAN TO FORM THE VAGUE OUTLINES OF A SINISTER POWER--THE COSSACKS
DO YOU KNOW THAT FOUR COMRADES WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES AND THEIR FREEDOM FIGHTING AGAINST TYRANNY OF THE TSAR HAVE BEEN FLUNG INTO PETER-PAUL PRISON--THE HISTORICAL TOMB OF LIBERTY IN THE UPROAR HE POUNDED AND YELLED
AND SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CONGRESS WERE VOTING FOR THE FACTION OF MARIA SPIRIDONOVA AND SENDING THEIR REPRESENTATIVES INTO THE TSAY-EE-KAH AT SMOLNY
THE CAPITALISTS
BOTH AT HELSINGFORS AND AT KIEV THE GOVERNMENTS WERE GATHERING TROOPS WHICH COULD BE DEPENDED UPON AND ENTERING UPON CAMPAIGNS OF CRUSHING BOLSHEVISM AND OF DISARMING AND EXPELLING RUSSIAN TROOPS
UP IN FRONT OF THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING MACHINES BEING DIRECTED BACK UP THE NEVSKY
ROBBERS AND THIEVES ARE WAITING FOR THE MOMENT TO LOOT AND BURN
THERE WERE PRESENT ALL THE PARTY INTELLECTUALS THE LEADERS--AND DELEGATES OF THE PETROGRAD WORKERS AND GARRISON
THE CADET SHULGIN WRITING IN A KIEV NEWSPAPER SAID THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT'S DECLARATION THAT RUSSIA WAS A REPUBLIC CONSTITUTED A GROSS ABUSE OF ITS POWERS
AT THE FIRST ATTEMPT OF THE DARK FORCES TO MAKE TROUBLE ON THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD WHETHER ROBBERY OR FIGHTING THE CRIMINALS WILL BE WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH
ONLY AN SPONTANEOUS MASS-MOVEMENT COULD BRING ABOUT THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
PLUNGING AHEAD
THE ARMY COMMITTEES HAVE SUPPRESSED ALL NEWS FROM PETROGRAD BUT WE NOW HAVE A REGULAR SYSTEM OF COURIERS GRAPHIC PAGE 224
LENIN AND TROTZKY REMAINED IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CONTINUED TO FUNCTION
ONE CARLOAD OF POTATOES AND ONE CARLOAD OF CABBAGES HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND CARRIED AWAY NO ONE KNOWS WHERE TO
LET DUKHONIN AND THOSE WITH HIM UNDERSTAND WELL THAT WE SHALL NOT DEAL GENTLY WITH THOSE WHO BAR THE ROAD TO PEACE DYBENKO SALUTED THE ASSEMBLY IN THE NAME OF THE FLEET AND KRUSHINSKY MEMBER OF THE VIKZHEL SAID FROM THIS MOMENT WHEN THE UNION OF ALL TRUE SOCIALISTS IS REALISED THE WHOLE ARMY OF RAILWAY WORKERS PLACES ITSELF ABSOLUTELY AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY AND LUNATCHARSKY ALMOST WEEPING AND PROSHIAN FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND FINALLY SAHARASHVILI FOR THE UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE MARTOV'S AND OF GORKY'S GROUPS WHO DECLARED
KRYLENKO THE SQUAT WIDE-FACED SOLDIER ALWAYS SMILING WITH HIS VIOLENT GESTURES AND TUMBLING SPEECH
YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN MURDERERS HE CRIED
THE ARBITRARY ORGANISATION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI WHICH IS CALLED BUREAU OF ORGANISATION FOR THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF PEASANTS IS INVITING ALL THE PEASANTS SOVIETS TO SEND DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS AT PETROGRAD
BUT THE EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE SOON SHOWED ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BY ELECTING AS PRESIDING OFFICER MARIA SPIRIDONOVA LEADER OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTION ARIES
OCCASIONALLY A MONK WAS VISIBLE SILENTLY WATCHING THE PULSE OF THE PROLETARIAN ARMY THROBBING ON THE ROAD
HE DID NOT MENTION THE CONSEQUENCES 4
HALF-FEARFUL HALF-CONTEMPTUOUS THE CROWDS ON THE SIDEWALK WATCHED THEM PASS IN HATEFUL SILENCE
AUTOMOBILES FULL OF OFFICERS KEPT COMING AND ALL THE MINISTERS WERE THERE
A MESSAGE HAS JUST COME FROM THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
VOTE THEY CRIED
KERENSKY HIMSELF CAME TWICE TO PLEAD PASSIONATELY FOR NATIONAL UNITY ONCE BURSTING INTO TEARS AT THE END
WHO ADMINISTERS THE CONFISCATED LAND--THE FORMER PROPRIETOR OR THE LAND COMMITTEES
DENUNCIATION APPEAL DECREE
FROM THE STAFF OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE SEIZURE OF GATCHINA AND TSARSKOYE SELO BY KERENSKY'S DETACHMENTS IS TO BE EXPLAINED BY THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ARTILLERY AND MACHINE-GUNS IN THESE PLACES WHEREAS KERENSKY'S CAVALRY WAS PROVIDED WITH ARTILLERY FROM THE BEGINNING
PEACE
PEACE
PEACE
WORKERS CONTROL IS A BETTER SECURITY IN THIS RESPECT FOR THE INTERESTS OF MODERN SOCIETY OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE THAN THE ARBITRARY WILL OF THE OWNERS WHO ARE GUIDED ONLY BY THEIR SELFISH DESIRE FOR MATERIAL PROFITS OR POLITICAL PRIVILEGES
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES DELEGATES FROM THE PEASANTS SOVIETS IT WAS EXACTLY 5:17 A.M
UP AT SMOLNY THE NEW COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS WAS NOT IDLE
AS FOR THE OTHER NECESSITIES THE PRICE OF THESE INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY
DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE WAS FIRST PROPOSED TO KERENSKY HE SUGGESTED AN ASSEMBLY OF ALL THE ELEMENTS IN THE NATION--"THE LIVE FORCES AS HE CALLED THEM--INCLUDING BANKERS MANUFACTURERS LAND-OWNERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CADET PARTY
IN PETROGRAD THE STAFF SUBMITTED TO SMOLNY'S COMMISSARS AT ONCE
THE YUNKERS AND WHITE GUARDS HELD THE KREMLIN AND THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN BEATEN UPON FROM ALL SIDES BY THE TROOPS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
GOING HOME I SAW THEM PASS SWINGING ALONG WITH THE REGULAR TREAD OF VETERANS BAYONETS IN PERFECT ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE DESERTED STREETS OF THE CONQUERED CITY
NOTE
GIVE ME THE PAPER HE READ IT CAREFULLY GLANCING AT ME WITH KEEN EYES
OUR PROGRAMME SAID THE OFFICER
BUT WITH A SAVAGE ROAR THE PEOPLE RUSHED THE CAR AND FALLING UPON THE OLD GENERAL DRAGGED HIM OUT AND BEAT HIM TO DEATH ON THE PLATFORM
COMMANDANT ADJUTANT ONE DAY AS I CAME UP TO THE OUTER GATE I SAW TROTZKY AND HIS WIFE JUST AHEAD OF ME
PETROGRAD AFTER ALL IN SPITE OF BEING FOR A CENTURY THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT IS STILL AN ARTIFICIAL CITY
IT IS INTERESTING TO REPRODUCE HERE A PASSAGE FROM THAT SAME PAPER--THE ORGAN OF THOSE BOLSHEVIKI SO WELL KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS GERMAN AGENTS
THE BRUNNOVIKI WERE THE ARMOURED CAR TROOPS THE KEY TO THE SITUATION
THEY REESTABLISHED CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR SOLDIERS
THEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT NERATOV FORMER ASSISTANT FOREIGN MINISTER HAD DISAPPEARED WITH THE SECRET TREATIES
IMMEDIATE PROPOSALS OF A GENERAL DEMOCRATIC PEACE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF GREAT LANDED ESTATES TO THE PEASANTS AND THE HONEST CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS
THEY'RE GOING TO DISSOLVE THE DUMA HE SAID
AT THE SAME TIME PROFITS WERE ENORMOUS
BOLSHEVIKI NOW CALL THEMSELVES THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN ORDER TO EMPHASISE THEIR COMPLETE SEPARATION FROM THE TRADITION OF MODERATE OR PARLIAMENTARY SOCIALISM WHICH DOMINATES THE MENSHEVIKI AND THE SO-CALLED MAJORITY SOCIALISTS IN ALL COUNTRIES
HERE IS THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION CARRIED AT THIS MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISON BY 61 VOTES AGAINST 11 AND 12 NOT VOTING
INCONSPICUOUSLY CERTAIN OF THE MOST LOYAL REGIMENTS FROM WIDELY-SEPARATED DIVISIONS WERE ORDERED TO PETROGRAD
BOLSHEVIK COSSACKS A LITTLE OFFICER IN A LEATHER COAT CAME RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS
ON NOVEMBER 15TH LUNATCHARSKY COMMISSAR OF EDUCATION BROKE INTO TEARS AT THE SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS AND RUSHED FROM THE ROOM CRYING I CANNOT STAND IT
ALREADY THE FIRST DECREE WAS ON THE PRESSES TO BE CIRCULATED IN THOUSANDS THROUGH THE CITY STREETS THAT NIGHT AND SHIPPED IN BALES BY EVERY TRAIN SOUTHWARD AND EAST
THOSE WHO ARE DAMAGED BECAUSE OF THIS SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY ARE ENTITLED TO PUBLIC AID DURING THE TIME NECESSARY FOR THEM TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE NEW CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE
IN RAILWAY TRAINS STREET-CARS ALWAYS THE SPURTING UP OF IMPROMPTU DEBATE EVERYWHERE
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT IN MY COUNTRY PEOPLE TRIED TO CHANGE THINGS BY LAW
MY GOD NO HE ANSWERED
NO TWISTING OF THE FACTS NO CALUMNY AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEFEAT THE PEOPLE
YOUNG LADIES FROM THE PROVINCES CAME UP TO THE CAPITAL TO LEARN FRENCH AND CULTIVATE THEIR VOICES AND THE GAY YOUNG BEAUTIFUL OFFICERS WORE THEIR GOLD-TRIMMED CRIMSON BASHLIKI AND THEIR ELABORATE CAUCASIAN SWORDS AROUND THE HOTEL LOBBIES
LIFE WAS MORE INTENSE THERE
AFTER 9 O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING ONLY TENANTS MAY LEAVE THE HOUSE UNDER STRICT CONTROL OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEES
THE ARMY WAS STARVING AND IN THE BIG CITIES THERE WAS NO BREAD
10 MAKING ADVERTISEMENTS A MONOPOLY OF THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPER
AND THE VAST AND TERRIBLE MENACE OF THE GERMANS
THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH WAS CHALLENGING DELEGATE AFTER DELEGATE ON THE GROUND THAT THEY HAD BEEN ILLEGALLY ELECTED
HIM THEY CAPTURED AND LOCKED IN A SMALL ROOM
THEN HE SMILED AND HANDED ME THE PASS
A FEW MINUTES LATER ANTONOV APPEARED MAKING A ROUND OF INSPECTION
THE SOLDIERS REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL BUT WOULD NOT DISARM
YOU WON'T GET IT RESPONDED THE SOLDIER
PASS TO THE NORTHERN FRONT THIS PASS WAS ISSUED UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF TROTZKY THREE DAYS AFTER THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION
SOLDIERS WORKERS CLERICAL EMPLOYEES
MARTOV TRIED TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT BE HEARD
DO YOU TRUST ME
THIS PLAN OF CAIN IS BEING PUT INTO OPERATION BY OUR COMMON ENEMIES THE OPPRESSORS THE PRIVILEGED CLASSES--GENERALS BANKERS LANDLORDS FORMER OFFICIALS FORMER SERVANTS OF THE TSAR
BELOW THEM THE SECOND SIEZD OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS BOILED AND SWIRLED AND OVER THEIR HEADS THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE FUNCTIONED WHITE-HOT HOLDING IN ITS HANDS THE THREADS OF INSURRECTION AND STRIKING WITH A LONG ARM
YES COMRADE WE SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU THE COLONEL THANKED HIM AND SAT DOWN FILLING A GLASS OF TEA
THEY CLUMPED OUT HURRIEDLY
TEMPORARY COMMISSARS WERE APPOINTED TO THE VARIOUS MINISTRIES
WE HAVE NOT ATTACKED THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND WE SHALL NOT DO SO
WE REGRET INFINITELY THAT THE INVITED COMRADES REFUSED
THE VIKZHEL SENT A TELEGRAM TO ALL RUSSIA
THE FIRST ACT HAS LASTED LONG ENOUGH
FROM THE TOP OF THE KREMLIN WALL GIGANTIC BANNERS UNROLLED TO THE GROUND
BACKGROUND
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS V
THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH HUGE CANVASES IN MASSIVE GILT FRAMES--HISTORICAL BATTLE-SCENES
SOLDIERS RAN OUT INTO THE ROAD BEFORE US SHOUTED SHTOI AND THREW UP THEIR GUNS
PROCLAMATION IN RUSSIAN TITLE FOLLOWS PROCLAMATION OF THE FALL OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 7TH OUR CALENDAR WHICH WE HELPED TO DISTRIBUTE FROM A MOTOR-TRUCK JUST AFTER THE SURRENDER OF THE WINTER PALACE
TROTZKY WAS LONG A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP
THE UKRAINEAN RADA HAD TAKEN COMMAND OF ALL SOUTHERN RUSSIA AND WAS FURNISHING KALEDIN REINFORCEMENTS AND SUPPLIES
A DELEGATION OF THE SOLDIERS SECTION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET ASKED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE BE ADMITTED TO THE STAFF OF THE PETROGRAD DISTRICT
SMOLNY WAS CUT OFF BUT THE DUMA AND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION WERE IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH ALL THE YUNKER SCHOOLS AND WITH KERENSKY AT TSARSKOYE
FROM THE COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL CITY DUMA COMRADES WORKINGMEN AND WORKINGWOMEN
ALL WHO ARE CAPABLE OF SABOTAGE DISORGANISATION OR DISORDER ALL DESERTERS ALL SLACKERS ALL LOOTERS SHOULD BE FORCED TO DO AUXILIARY SERVICE IN THE REAR OF THE ARMY
CHAPTER 12
THE CONDITIONS FAVOURABLE TO THIS AGITATION HAVE BEEN CREATED BY DELAY IN PASSING URGENT MEASURES AS WELL AS OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS CAUSED BY THE WAR AND THE GENERAL DISORDER
WHEN THE GRAVE THUNDER OF APPLAUSE HAD DIED AWAY LENIN SPOKE AGAIN
THE REVOLUTION IS LOST
AS WE LEFT THE DUMA A COMPANY OF RED GUARDS STERN-FACED AND DESPERATE CAME MARCHING DOWN THE DARK DESERTED STREET WITH A DOZEN PRISONERS--MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL BRANCH OF THE COUNCIL OF COSSACKS CAUGHT RED-HANDED PLOTTING COUNTER-REVOLUTION IN THEIR HEADQUARTERS
WE HAVE PROPOSED TO BOTH KERENSKY AND THE BOLSHEVIKI TO RETIRE FROM THE POWER
THE PEASANTS REVOLUTION IS NOT WAITING
SEVERAL DETACHMENTS OF NEUTRAL TROOPS WITH TCHERNOV AT THEIR HEAD WERE AT GATCHINA TRYING TO PERSUADE KERENSKY TO HALT HIS ATTACK ON PETROGRAD
SKRIPNIK LAUGHED
AN ARISTOCRATIC-LOOKING YOUTH WITH THE SHOULDER STRAPS OF A LIEUTENANT WAS ENTERING
EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE BOURGEOIS PRESS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPONS OF THE BOURGEOISIE
THEY DID NOT THINK THE COSSACKS WERE SO NEAR
THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SPOKE ON THE LAND DECREE
A GENERAL HAS NO MORE RIGHTS THAN A SOLDIER
THE TSAY-EE-KAH,_COMPOSED OF 108 MEMBERS WAS TO BE AUGUMENTED BY 108 MEMBERS ELECTED PROPORTIONALLY FROM THE PEASANTS CONGRESS
KERENSKY ATTEMPTED TO BREAK IT BY THE FORCE OF THE COSSACKS
A THRONG OF LITTLE BOYS WERE GATHERED THERE--STREET WAIFS WHO USED TO BE NEWSBOYS
ON NOVEMBER 16TH THE COMMISSION RETURNED FROM LEVASHOVO HEADQUARTERS OF THE WOMEN'S BATTALION
YOU GAVE UP YOUR LIVES AND EVERYTHING DEAR TO YOU YOU SUFFERED IN HORRIBLE PRISONS YOU WENT TO EXILE IN CHAINS
COME ON HE STARTED AT A HALF-TROT UP THE MIKHAILOVSKY AND WE FOLLOWED
ALL CLASS INSTITUTIONS OF ANY SORT WITH THEIR PROPERTY THEIR RULES OF PROCEDURE AND THEIR ARCHIVES ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE MUNICIPALITIES AND ZEMSTVOS
A MINISTRY OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES EXCEPT THE BOLSHEVIKI FOR SMOLNY RIAZANOV AND KAMENIEV DECLARED THAT A COALITION MINISTRY OF ALL PARTIES WAS ACCEPTABLE BUT PROTESTED AT DAN'S PROPOSALS
IT WILL APPRECIATE YOU MESSRS
THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI WOULD REMAIN IN POWER LONGER THAN THREE DAYS NEVER OCCURRED TO ANYBODY--EXCEPT PERHAPS TO LENIN TROTZKY THE PETROGRAD WORKERS AND THE SIMPLER SOLDIERS
TO THAT I ANSWER THAT I REJOICE IF ALL THESE ORGANISATIONS ARE DESTROYED
WHERE THEN ARE THEY GOING TO FIND TRAINED MEN TO EXECUTE THE DIVERSE AND COMPLICATED FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT
LAIDANSKY M
YOU FOREIGNERS LOOK DOWN ON US RUSSIANS BECAUSE SO LONG WE TOLERATED A MEDIAEVAL MONARCHY SAID HE
THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD ONCE AND FOR ALL APPLAUSE AND ANGRY CRIES
SO QUICKLY DID WE ADAPT OURSELVES TO THE NEWER SWIFTER LIFE
WE REFUSE TO ADMIT THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH AND ALSO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMAS
I TELL YOU THE REVOLUTION IS LOST
NOVOTCHERKASK NOVEMBER 8TH
THE BANKS ARE CLOSED
AS FOR THE PROCLAMATION THE INTERNATIONALISTS WERE IN THOROUGH ACCORD WITH ITS MAIN POINTS
IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH THREE FACTIONS IMMEDIATELY APPEARED
THE SOLDIERS WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND HURT LIKE CHILDREN UNJUSTLY SCOLDED
LAND DECREE--PEASANTS NAKAZ THE LAND QUESTION CAN ONLY BE PERMANENTLY SETTLED BY THE GENERAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
ETERNAL MEMORY TO THOSE WHO FELL
THE TELEGRAMS DISCOVERED IN THE MINISTRY LEFT IT TO BE INFERRED THAT FRENCH ARTILLERY WAS USED
WITH A RUSH AND A SHOUT THOUSANDS OF SOLDIERS AND RED GUARDS POURED THROUGH WINDOWS DOORS AND HOLES IN THE WALL
WE'RE NOT ASKING MUCH OF YOU
THE LATE PASSERBY STOOPED TO PICK THEM UP
KAMENIEV ANSWERED DISCREETLY
VICTORY IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THE VOTE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST AND THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS LEFT THE CONGRESS IN A WHIRLWIND OF JOCULAR INSULTS
FOR TEN MINUTES THE ROOM WENT MAD
SHAME AND CURSES TO THE TRAITORS OF THE PEOPLE
SAID WE WERE SPIES THEY ALL BEGAN TO TALK AT ONCE
THE NOON CANNON BOOMED FROM PETER-PAUL AS I WENT DOWN THE NEVSKY
CRIES NO SUCH SLOGAN
I HEARD MARTOV'S SPEECH IN ANSWER TO THE CADETS
OH NO HE SAID
THE REVISION OF THE COMMITTEE'S RIGHTS IN THE SENSE OF WIDENING THEM AND OF CONVERTING THE COMMITTEE INTO A FUNDAMENTAL STATE INSTITUTE FOR THE ELABORATION OF LAW PROJECTS CALCULATED TO REORGANISE PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION IN RUSSIA UPON DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES
SHOUTING WAVES OF RED GUARDS ASSAULTING CRUMPLED UNDER THE WITHERING BLAST
WELL THEY ASKED DOES THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT INTEND TO CONFISCATE THE ESTATES OF OUR GREAT COSSACK LAND-OWNERS AND DIVIDE THEM AMONG THE WORKING COSSACKS TO THIS LENIN REPLIED
THE IMAGE OF THE ARMY COLD AND HUNGRY SAVING OUR VERY EXISTENCE BY ITS BLOOD AND ITS TORTURES DOES NOT LEAVE US FOR A SINGLE MOMENT
INSIDE THE NARROW SPACE IN FRONT OF THE RAILING WAS CROWDED WITH WELL-DRESSED PERSONS OUTWARDLY RESPECTFUL BUT INWARDLY FULL OF MURDER--BOURGEOIS WHO WANTED PERMITS FOR THEIR AUTOMOBILES OR PASSPORTS TO LEAVE THE CITY AMONG THEM MANY FOREIGNERS
MAYOR SCHREIDER FOR THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES STATED THAT HE WAS OPPOSED TO ALL AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE OLD PALACE SERVANTS IN THEIR BLUE AND RED AND GOLD UNIFORMS STOOD NERVOUSLY ABOUT FROM FORCE OF HABIT REPEATING YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE BARIN IT IS FORBIDDEN WE PENETRATED AT LENGTH TO THE GOLD AND MALACHITE CHAMBER WITH CRIMSON BROCADE HANGINGS WHERE THE MINISTERS HAD BEEN IN SESSION ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT AND WHERE THE SHVEITZARI HAD BETRAYED THEM TO THE RED GUARDS
SEVERAL THINGS
YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPOSE UPON THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE A POLICY DICTATED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE BOURGEOISIE
AND AT THE SAME TIME KRYLENKO ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DETACHMENTS OF FANATICAL SAILORS SET OUT FOR THE STAVKA BREATHING THREATS OF VENGEANCE SEE APP
WE ARE--AHEM--IN A MOST DIFFICULT POSITION AS YOU SEE WE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY BATTLE
WERE THE BOLSHEVIKI TO BE ADMITTED TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
THEY HAVE RAISED THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION AGAINST US
ALL THAT IS RESPECTABLE IS PERSECUTED AND IT IS THE PLEBE AND THE CRIMINALS WHO DOMINATE--AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE EXCEPT BY SHOOTING AND HANGING THEM
RESOLUTION TO REMAIN IN PERMANENT SESSION
THE CONQUERORS OF THESE RIOTS THE SAVIOURS OF THE WRECK OF OUR COUNTRY THESE WILL BE NEITHER THE BOLSHEVIKI NOR THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION NOR THE TROOPS OF KERENSKY--BUT WE THE UNION OF RAILWAYMEN
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES CHARGES THE LOCAL SOVIETS IMMEDIATELY TO TAKE THE MOST ENERGETIC MEASURES TO OPPOSE ALL COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ANTI-SEMITIC DISTURBANCES AND ALL POGROMS OF WHATEVER NATURE
HE BECKONED FINALLY TO THE SOLDIER IN COMMAND OF THE GUARD
ARREST THEM WITH YOUR OWN FORCES AND TURN THEM OVER INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIET AUTHORITY WHICH WILL JUDGE THEM IN OPEN AND PUBLIC REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL
A THREATENING SILENCE HUNG OVER THE PLACE--AS OF A SORT OF PURGATORY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL A POLITICAL NO MAN'S LAND

PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR ON EDUCATION A
KERENSKY'S ADVANCE ON NOVEMBER 9TH KERENSKY AND HIS COSSACKS ARRIVED AT GATCHINA WHERE THE GARRISON HOPELESSLY SPLIT INTO TWO FACTIONS IMMEDIATELY SURRENDERED
THAT DAY AND THE NEXT THE DUMA CONTINUED TO MEET INTERRUPTED FREQUENTLY BY RED GUARDS AND SAILORS WHO POLITELY REQUESTED THE ASSEMBLY TO DISPERSE
THE TREATY OF PEACE FOLLOWS
AND THE INSURGENT ARMY AND FLEET ORGANISATIONS
AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT--AND THAT'S ALL
COMRADES HE CRIED AND THERE WAS A HUSH
4 CALLED THE ATTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO THE FACT THAT THE PETROGRAD WORKERS WERE BEING ARMED AND DEMANDED STERN MEASURES AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI
AS FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI THEY WILL BE DONE AWAY WITH BY ONE OF TWO METHODS
TWO DECREES ON THE PRESS IN THE SERIOUS DECISIVE HOUR OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IT THE PROVISIONAL REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IS COMPELLED TO ADOPT A SERIES OF MEASURES AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY PRESS OF ALL SHADES
THE GOVERNMENT NO MORE GOVERNMENT ONE ANSWERED WITH A GRIN SLAVA BOGU GLORY TO GOD THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET OUT OF HIM
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE ARMY WAS ABOLISHED
WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
KERENSKY ORDERED THE PRINT-SHOP OF RABOTCHI PUT TO BE OCCUPIED
THE BOLSHEVIKS ORGANISED THEIR OWN CABINET WITH NICHOLAS LENINE AS PREMIER AND LEON TROTSKY--MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
NOTE.--BY THE TERM CONFERENCE MUST BE UNDERSTOOD A MEETING OF THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES TOGETHER WITH DELEGATES OF COMMITTEES ONE DEGREE LOWER IN RANK
THE STAFF HAS NOT CHANGED
NOTE.--ALL PERSONS WITH SPECIAL TRAINING MUST BE LISTED IN A SPECIAL LIST
DEVIL
AT THE SAME TIME THE POGROMISTS MAY ATTEMPT TO CALL UPON THE PEOPLE OF PETROGRAD FOR TROUBLE AND BLOODSHED
LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY SHARING THE BOLSHEVIK PROGRAMME OF DICTATORSHIP OF THE WORKING-CLASS AT FIRST WERE RELUCTANT TO FOLLOW THE RUTHLESS BOLSHEVIK TACTICS
WE THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE THE PROTECTORS OF THE SOVIETS--OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
THE CADET PARTY REPRESENTS THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION MILITANT
COMPLETE FREEDOM OF PROPAGANDA IS TO BE RE-ESTABLISHED IN THE COUNTRY
WILL YOU SHOOT NO I'M NOT GOING TO SHOOT PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T ANY GUNS
CONSPIRATORS--NO
FROM A BASKET ONE GRABBED A GREASY WOODEN SPOON
I EXPECT A TELEPHONE CALL EVERY MINUTE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE COMING
I TELL YOU HE RAISED HIS FIST IF ONE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS IS HARMED YOU'LL HAVE A REVOLT ON YOUR HANDS THE CROWD STIRRED CONFUSEDLY
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BOOK
ALL BANKS WITH BRANCHES THE CENTRAL STATE SAVINGS BANK WITH BRANCHES AND THE SAVINGS BANKS AT THE POST AND TELEGRAPH OFFICES ARE TO BE OPENED BEGINNING NOVEMBER 22ND FROM 11 A
ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE VARIOUS DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS ALL OVER RUSSIA WERE CRACKING AND CHANGING
WE ORDER IMMEDIATELY THE REGIMENTS TO MOBILISE ON A WAR FOOTING AND TO AWAIT NEW ORDERS
BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WAVERED IRRESISTIBLY FORCED TO THE LEFT BY THE PRESSURE OF THE RISING DISSATISFACTION OF THE MASSES
THEY DEMAND IN A SORT OF PANIC THAT WE DISSOLVE THEM BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER
WE HAD TICKETS TO THE BALLET AT THE MARINSKY THEATRE--ALL THEATRES WERE OPEN--BUT IT WAS TOO EXCITING OUT OF DOORS
AS FOR THESE THREATS TO DISSOLVE US LET THEM TRY--ONLY OVER OUR DEAD BODIES SHALL THEY SEIZE THIS CHAMBER WHERE LIKE THE ROMAN SENATORS OF OLD WE AWAIT WITH DIGNITY THE COMING OF THE GOTHS
THE WAITERS AND HOTEL SERVANTS WERE ORGANISED AND REFUSED TIPS
IN MY NEXT BOOK KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK I INTEND TO TREAT THIS MATTER AT SOME LENGTH PUBLISHING SEVERAL SECRET DOCUMENTS DISCOVERED IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT PETROGRAD
WE WENT TO THE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSAR IN ORDER TO ARRANGE FOR OUR RETURN TICKETS
NOTE.--ORDERLIES ARE LEFT ONLY FOR HEADQUARTERS CHANCERIES COMMITTEES AND OTHER ARMY ORGANISATIONS
2 NOVEMBER 12TH IN THE EVENING KERENSKY SENT A PROPOSITION TO THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS--"TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS KERENSKY'S MEN OPENED ARTILLERY FIRE
PICKETS OF A DOZEN SOLDIERS WITH FIXED BAYONETS LOUNGED AT THE STREET-CROSSINGS RED-FACED OLD MEN IN RICH FUR COATS SHOOK THEIR FISTS AT THEM SMARTLY-DRESSED WOMEN SCREAMED EPITHETS
AND THE SALVATION ARMY ADMITTED TO RUSSIA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY PLASTERED THE WALLS WITH ANNOUNCEMENTS OF GOSPEL MEETINGS WHICH AMUSED AND ASTOUNDED RUSSIAN AUDIENCES
THE DAMN FOOLS LET MOST OF THEM GO AGAIN BEFORE WE MADE UP OUR MINDS DOWN THE VOSKRESSENSKY PROSPECT A GREAT MASS OF SAILORS WERE DRAWN UP AND BEHIND THEM CAME MARCHING SOLDIERS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH
THIS WAS THEIR BATTLE FOR THEIR WORLD
2 NOVEMBER 1917 NO
THE SAILORS CONTINUED TO ADVANCE UNTIL THEY HAD FIRED ALL THEIR CARTRIDGES
TO THE MULTIFORM DISCONTENT OF THE PEOPLE THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS HAD ONE ANSWER
NO ANSWERED TROTZKY
THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES ALSO HAD THEIR ALL-RUSSIAN ORGANISATION WITH A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AT PETROGRAD WHICH CO-OPERATED WITH THE TRADE UNIONS
MEANWHILE THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD BEEN UNDERMINING THE POWER OF THE VIKZHEL AN APPEAL OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET TO ALL RAILWAY WORKERS CALLED UPON THEM TO FORCE THE VIKZHEL TO SURRENDER ITS POWERS
THERE MUST BE PEACE
BUT ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY BEGAN TO CLUMP UP THE STAIRS IN GROUPS OF TEN OR TWENTY--BIG ROUGH MEN IN COARSE CLOTHES FRESH FROM THE BATTLE-LINE WHERE THEY HAD FOUGHT LIKE DEVILS FOR A WEEK SEEING THEIR COMRADES FALL ALL ABOUT THEM
WHO ARE YOU ANYWAY HE ASKED
LET US CALL TO THE GERMAN WORKMEN SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WHO WANT PEACE NOT LESS THAN WE DO TO
LET US FOR A MOMENT FORGET THE CLASS STRUGGLE BUT HE GOT NO FARTHER
THE REPULSE OF KERENSKY IS THE CONFIRMATION OF THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO A PEACEFUL FREE LIFE TO LAND BREAD AND POWER
THE SOVIET REFUSED AND DREW UP THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF REPRESENTATION WHICH KERENSKY AGREED TO
THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY DONE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT A MILE FURTHER THAT VLADIMIR NICOLAIEVITCH COCKED HIS EAR AND SHOUTED TO THE CHAUFFEUR TO STOP
AND IN PLACE OF THE FIERCE GORODOVOYE CITY POLICE A MILD-MANNERED AND UNARMED CITIZEN MILITIA PATROLLED THE STREETS--STILL THERE WERE MANY QUAINT ANACHRONISMS
ALSO A NATIONALISTIC PARTY
YOU WILL BE GIVEN REPRESENTATION IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND THEN IT WILL BE YOUR GOVERNMENT TOO THE COSSACKS DEPARTED THINKING HARD
ANON HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN AT A TYPEWRITER AND POUNDED AWAY WITH ONE FINGER
ALL SOLDIERS AND REVOLUTIONARY OFFICERS NOW UNDER ARREST FOR SO-CALLED POLITICAL CRIMES ARE AT ONCE TO BE SET FREE THE EX-PREMIER KERENSKY OVERTHROWN BY THE PEOPLE REFUSES TO SUBMIT TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND ATTEMPTS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT ELECTED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS--THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
OUTSIDE THE DOOR WAITED A DOZEN VOLUNTEERS READY TO CARRY WORD TO THE FARTHEST QUARTERS OF THE CITY
WELCOME TO THE BATTALION COMMITTEE OF THE SIXTH RESERVE ENGINEERS BATTALION CRIED MY FRIEND AND INTRODUCED ME AS AN AMERICAN SOCIALIST
THE COMMITTEE WAS DOUBTFUL BUT THE BIG RED GUARD ANSWERED FIRMLY THAT IT WAS FORBIDDEN
BUT AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS NO LEGAL POWER IN THE LAND THE ONLY CENTRE OF ORDER IS THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT
THE DUMA BEING THE ONLY EXISTING LEGAL GOVERNMENT IN THE CITY ELECTED BY EQUAL DIRECT AND SECRET SUFFRAGE WOULD NOT RECOGNISE THE NEW POWER HE HAD TOLD TROTZKY
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE HAS AGAIN ASKED THAT YOU TAKE YOUR TURN ON GUARD-DUTY WITH THE REST OF THE MEN SHE SAID
NOW THE COSSACKS HAVE FALLEN BACK TEN KILOMETRES IN OUR SECTOR
3 WHICH CAME DOWN IN A STEADY STREAM FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS IN SESSION UPSTAIRS
WHILE WILHELM'S TROOPS ARE THREATENING PETROGRAD THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY AND KORNILOV IS PREPARING TO RUN AWAY FROM PETROGRAD AND TURN MOSCOW INTO A BASE OF COUNTER-REVOLUTION
YOU HAVE HEARD THE STATEMENTS OF TWO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES
KERENSKY
KERENSKY
KERENSKY
KERENSKY
KERENSKY
THE FOLLOWING MORNING WITH TWO OTHER CORRESPONDENTS I INTERVIEWED KERENSKY SEE APP
HUMAN SOCIETY FLOWED MOLTEN IN PRIMAL HEAT AND FROM THE TOSSING SEA OF FLAME WAS EMERGING THE CLASS STRUGGLE STARK AND PITILESS--AND THE FRAGILE SLOWLY-COOLING CRUST OF NEW PLANETS
AND THE ATTEMPTED NEGOTIATIONS OF AN ENGLISH AGENT WITH A BULGARIAN CHURCH DIGNITARY
YOU REALISE I PRESUME HE SAID INSOLENTLY THAT BY TAKING UP ARMS AGAINST YOUR BROTHERS YOU ARE MAKING YOURSELVES THE TOOLS OF MURDERERS AND TRAITORS NOW BROTHER ANSWERED THE SOLDIER EARNESTLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
MEANWHILE THE VIKZHEL'S CONFERENCE TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO MEET NIGHT AND DAY
WE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES INSIST UPON THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS ARRESTED IN THE WINTER PALACE
THE FOURTH YEAR'S CAMPAIGN WILL MEAN THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMY AND THE COUNTRY
AS WE CAME OUT INTO THE DARK AND GLOOMY DAY ALL AROUND THE GREY HORIZON FACTORY WHISTLES WERE BLOWING A HOARSE AND NERVOUS SOUND FULL OF FOREBODING
NOW PETROGRAD WAS BEING BETRAYED
THEN THIS CLEAR-EYED YOUNG SOLDIER HAD SPOKEN AND IN A FLASH THEY KNEW IT FOR THE TRUTH
WE ARE ASKED HE SAID IF WE INTEND TO HAVE A VYSTUPLENNIE I CAN GIVE A CLEAR ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
KAMENIEV EXPLAINED
THE PAVLOVSK SCHOOL WAS SURROUNDED
BOTH AFTER AND BEFORE THE WINTER PALACE FELL THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE PILFERING
RECOGNISING THAT FOR THE SALVATION OF THE CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION IT IS INDISPENSABLE IMMEDIATELY TO CONSTITUTE A GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY ORGANISED IN THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES RECOGNISING MOREOVER THAT THE TASK OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE ATTAINMENT OF PEACE THE TRANSFER OF THE LAND INTO THE HANDS OF THE AGRARIAN COMMITTEES THE ORGANISATION OF CONTROL OVER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON THE DATE DECIDED THE CONGRESS APPOINTS AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO CONSTITUTE SUCH A GOVERNMENT AFTER AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GROUPS OF THE DEMOCRACY WHICH ARE TAKING PART IN THE CONGRESS
WE ARE HOLDING OUT OUR HAND TO YOU
KNIGHTS OF ST GEORGE THE CROSS OF ST GEORGE WAS AWARDED FOR DISTINGUISHED ACTION IN BATTLE
THE DARDANELLES MUST BELONG TO RUSSIA
HOWEVER DIFFICULT IT BE FOR US TO WORK UNDER THE CONSTANT THREAT OF INTERFERENCE BY ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN OUR HARD-WORKING LIFE HOWEVER DEPRESSING IT BE TO KNOW THAT OUR COUNTRY AND THE REVOLUTION ARE ON THE VERGE OF RUIN WE NEVERTHELESS ALL OF US FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST EMPLOYEES ARTELSHTCHIKI COUNTERS LABOURERS COURIERS ETC ARE CONTINUING TO FULFIL OUR DUTIES WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH THE ENSURING OF PROVISIONS AND MUNITIONS TO THE FRONT AND COUNTRY
IT WAS THEIR SOVIET WHICH PROCLAIMED TO THE WORLD THE RUSSIAN PEACE TERMS--"NO ANNEXATIONS NO INDEMNITIES AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES
KARSAVIN RELIEVED ME AT FIVE O'CLOCK JUST THEN THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPENED AND THERE ENTERED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE WITH ANOTHER SOLDIER
THESE CAME FOR THE MOST PART FROM AMONG THE SONS OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
HE HAD BEEN TO DEMAND THAT THE DUMA RECOGNISE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLES COMMISSARS AND THE MAYOR HAD GIVEN HIM A FLAT REFUSAL
WE DON'T RECOGNISE YOUR GOVERNMENT LENIN STOOD THERE QUITE CALMLY GRIPPING THE DESK WITH BOTH HANDS HIS LITTLE EYES THOUGHTFULLY SURVEYING THE TUMULT BENEATH
NATURALLY THEREFORE THEY AGREED WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES THAT RUSSIA MUST FIRST BE A PARLIAMENTARY STATE--THOUGH WITH SOME IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES
THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS RECEIVED TROTZKY'S NOTE WITH CONTEMPTUOUS SILENCE ACCOMPANIED BY ANONYMOUS INTERVIEWS IN THE NEWSPAPERS FULL OF SPITE AND RIDICULE
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MAIN GATEWAY THE DOORS STOOD WIDE OPEN LIGHT STREAMED OUT AND FROM THE HUGE PILE CAME NOT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
YOUR LIVES WILL BE IN DANGER IF YOU ARE CAPTURED
TSAY-EE-KAH ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
THE LONG VAULTED CORRIDORS LIT BY RARE ELECTRIC LIGHTS WERE THRONGED WITH HURRYING SHAPES OF SOLDIERS AND WORKMEN SOME BENT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HUGE BUNDLES OF NEWSPAPERS PROCLAMATIONS PRINTED PROPAGANDA OF ALL SORTS
THE BOURGEOIS RADA AT KIEV EXTENDED THE BOUNDARIES OF UKRAINE UNTIL THEY INCLUDED ALL THE RICHEST AGRICULTURAL LANDS OF SOUTH RUSSIA AS FAR EAST AS THE URALS AND BEGAN THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL ARMY
HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO BITTERLY REBUKE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR LEAVING THE CONGRESS
THE COMMISSAR OF WAR LOOKED THROUGH HIS POCKETS--HE HADN'T A KOPEK
WE WILL BE ISOLATED AND THE WHOLE THING WILL FALL SO KAMENIEV RIAZANOV AND OTHERS
THE PATROLS AROUND BONFIRES ON THE CORNERS RAN OUT WITH UPLIFTED ARMS TO CATCH THEM
ACROSS THE FLAT MARSHY PLAIN PETROGRAD GLITTERED
THE SOVIET OF HELSINGFORS AND THE TSENTROBALT CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE BALTIC FLEET JOINTLY PROCLAIMED A STATE OF SIEGE AND DECLARED THAT ALL ATTEMPTS TO INTERFERE WITH THE BOLSHEVIK FORCES AND ALL ARMED RESISTANCE TO ITS ORDERS WOULD BE SEVERELY REPRESSED
BUT IT IS REALLY WE WHO ARE USING THE CADETS
DO YOU HOLD THE REAR COMRADES AND WE WILL HOLD THE FRONT ON OCTOBER 25TH BEHIND CLOSED DOORS THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET DISCUSSED THE FORMATION OF A SPECIAL MILITARY COMMITTEE TO DECIDE THE WHOLE QUESTION
DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE TURN OF THE TIDE
ALONG ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WE FOUND OUT THERE WEREN'T ANY MORE YUNKERS ON THE NEVA SIDE
WHAT IS THE WAY OUT
THIS WAS UNDER THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
AT 1 A
IMMENSELY STRENGTHENED BY THE COLLAPSE OF THE LAST IMPORTANT STRONGHOLD OF HOSTILE MILITARY POWER IN RUSSIA THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT BEGAN WITH CONFIDENCE THE ORGANISATION OF THE STATE
WE SHALL OFFER PEACE TO THE PEOPLES OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES UPON THE BASIS OF THE SOVIET TERMS--NO ANNEXATIONS NO INDEMNITIES AND THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES
SMOLNY SHUT OFF ALL ELECTRIC LIGHTS IN THEATRES SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS CUT DOWN THE NUMBER OF STREET CARS AND CONFISCATED THE PRIVATE STORES OF FIRE-WOOD HELD BY THE FUEL-DEALERS
YOU TALK LIKE KERENSKY SHOUTED A ROUGH VOICE
WE MENSHEVIKI DO NOT WISH TO PROVOKE A CABINET CRISIS AND WE ARE READY TO DEFEND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WITH ALL OUR ENERGY TO THE LAST DROP OF OUR BLOOD--IF ONLY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ON ALL THESE BURNING QUESTIONS WILL SPEAK THE CLEAR AND PRECISE WORDS AWAITED BY THE PEOPLE WITH SUCH IMPATIENCE THEN MARTOV FURIOUS
IN ANOTHER VOLUME KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK I TRACE THE COURSE OF THE REVOLUTION UP TO AND INCLUDING THE GERMAN PEACE
ON NOVEMBER 16TH THE WINTER PALACE WAS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC WHILE THE INVENTORY WAS BEING MADE
| 1525 | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | SUNDRY | | 1
LENIN WAS READING THE DECREE ON LAND
BUT WE WILL VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH ITS SPIRIT FOR THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS KRAMAROV LONG STOOP-SHOULDERED AND NEAR-SIGHTED--DESTINED TO ACHIEVE SOME NOTORIETY AS THE CLOWN OF THE OPPOSITION
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT CALLS THE ATTENTION OF THE POPULATION TO THE FACT THAT IN OUR COUNTRY BEHIND THIS LIBERAL SHIELD IS HIDDEN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WEALTHIER CLASSES TO SEIZE THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WHOLE PRESS AND BY THIS MEANS TO POISON THE POPULAR MIND AND BRING CONFUSION INTO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MASSES
THIS LAST IS CALLED A GOVERNMENT OF CONSPIRATORS BUT THAT IS WRONG
THE OLD WORLD CRUMBLES DOWN THE NEW WORLD BEGINS THEN TROTZKY FULL OF FIRE
THE PERSONALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS BEING EDUCATED THROUGHOUT LIFE IS BEING FORMED GROWS RICHER IN CONTENT STRONGER AND MORE PERFECT
ON NOVEMBER 2D ONLY FIFTEEN DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAD ARRIVED
BEHIND THEM THE TWO BANNERS WERE INTERTWINED AGAINST THE WHITE WALL OVER THE EMPTY FRAME FROM WHICH THE TSAR'S PICTURE HAD BEEN TORN
THE GOVERNMENT MEANS BY A JUST AND DEMOCRATIC PEACE WHICH IS DESIRED BY THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS AND THE LABOURING CLASSES EXHAUSTED AND DEPLETED BY THE WAR--THAT PEACE WHICH THE RUSSIAN WORKERS AND PEASANTS AFTER HAVING STRUCK DOWN THE TSARIST MONARCHY HAVE NOT CEASED TO DEMAND CATEGORICALLY--IMMEDIATE PEACE WITHOUT ANNEXATIONS THAT IS TO SAY WITHOUT CONQUEST OF FOREIGN TERRITORY WITHOUT FORCIBLE ANNEXATION OF OTHER NATIONALITIES AND WITHOUT INDEMNITIES
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION PETROGRAD SOVIET OF W
IN ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS THE COSSACK MOVEMENT WAS ANTI-SOCIALIST AND MILITARISTIC
YOU COME HERE NOT AS GUESTS BUT AS MASTERS OF THIS HOUSE WHICH HOLDS THE HEART OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION
THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO PUT THE TELEPHONES UNDER CONTROL OF THE MINISTRY OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS
THEY HAD TRIED TO ARGUE WITH THE COSSACKS
ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN PETROGRAD IS KNOWN IN THE PROVINCES AND FROM THE DON FROM SIBERIA FROM VORONEZH AND OTHER PLACES PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO SEND FLOUR AND BREAD
TO SEND TO SMOLNY AT ONCE TWO DELEGATES FROM EACH MILITARY UNIT AND FIVE FROM EACH WARD SOVIET
CHAPTER 4
1 SAVINKOV SUMMONED TO EXPLAIN TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF HIS PARTY THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES REFUSED AND WAS EXPELLED
IN FRONT OF THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL A THREE-INCH FIELD-GUN LAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET SLEWED SIDEWAYS FROM THE RECOIL OF ITS LAST SHOT OVER THE ROOFS
SUPPORTED BY THE BOURGEOISIE THE KORNILOVTSI ARE OPENLY GETTING READY TO BREAK UP THE MEETING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE GOVERNMENT'S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHES THE MOST TACITURN OF OUR MINISTERS MR TERESTCHENKO HAS ACTUALLY TOLD THE TRENCHES THE FOLLOWING
THE SOLDIER HESITATED GRUMBLING SOMETHING ABOUT NOT WANTING TO DISTURB THE COMMANDANT FOR EVERY DEVIL THAT CAME ALONG
THE FIFTH BATTALION OF CYCLISTS STATIONED AT TSARSKOYE IS OURS THEN THE DELEGATE OF THE THIRD CYCLE BATTALION
IT IS NECESSARY BEFORE EVERYTHING TO PROMULGATE AT ONCE A DECREE TRANSMITTING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS LAND COMMITTEES AND TO ADOPT AN ENERGETIC COURSE OF ACTION ABROAD IN PROPOSING TO THE ALLIES TO PROCLAIM THEIR PEACE TERMS AND TO BEGIN PEACE-PARLEYS
E

AT THE FIRST CROSS-STREET I NOTICED THAT THE CITY MILITIAMEN WERE MOUNTED AND ARMED WITH REVOLVERS IN BRIGHT NEW HOLSTERS
BUT THE WORKERS WHO HAVE TAKEN THE POWER MUST REMEMBER THAT EDUCATION WILL SERVE THEM AS THE GREATEST INSTRUMENT IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR A BETTER LOT AND FOR A SPIRITUAL GROWTH
16
WHAT A CIVIL WAR
THE BOURGEOISIE CANNOT GIVE UP PETROGRAD ALTHOUGH THE RODZIANKOS WANT IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE BOURGEOISIE WHO ARE FIGHTING BUT OUR HEROIC SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
A WOODEN SPOON WAS PRODUCED AND I TOOK MY PLACE AT THE TABLE
THIS LAST IS THE ROAD TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
WHAT IS TAKING PLACE NOW IN PETROGRAD IS A MONSTROUS CALAMITY
WERE THEY PAID BY THE BOURGEOISIE TO DESTROY THE REVOLUTION
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET INTERPRETS THE PROGRAMME OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT AS
IN THIS TRAGIC MOMENT THROUGH WHICH THE RUSSIAN MASSES ARE LIVING THE MENSHEVIKI AND THEIR FOLLOWERS AND THE RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAVE BETRAYED THE WORKING-CLASS
I PARTICIPATED IN THE CONFERENCE OF THE TWELFTH ARMY ON THE QUESTION OF CALLING A CONGRESS OF ALL THE PEASANT DELEGATES OF THE ARMIES OF THE WESTERN FRONT AND I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE INSURRECTION WHICH OCCURRED HERE ZINOVIEV ROSE IN HIS SEAT AND SHOUTED YES YOU WERE AWAY--FOR A FEW MINUTES FEARFUL TUMULT
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THOUGHTS WHICH DRIVE ME MAD
DUMAS THE WORD DUMA MEANS ROUGHLY DELIBERATIVE BODY THE OLD IMPERIAL DUMA WHICH PERSISTED SIX MONTHS AFTER THE REVOLUTION IN A DEMOCRATISED FORM DIED A NATURAL DEATH IN SEPTEMBER 1917
THE MEETING-PLACE WAS A THEATRE IN WHICH UNDER THE OLD REGIME TO AUDIENCES OF OFFICERS AND GLITTERING LADIES AMATEUR PRESENTATIONS OF THE LATEST FRENCH COMEDY HAD ONCE TAKEN PLACE
AND WHOEVER ISN'T ON ONE SIDE IS ON THE OTHER WE WANDERED ON UP THE STREET WHERE THE LIGHTS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND WHERE PEOPLE RARELY PASSED
IT WAS AN ASTONISHING SCENE
THEN UP ROSE TROTZKY CALM AND VENOMOUS CONSCIOUS OF POWER GREETED WITH A ROAR
MOSCOW IS REAL RUSSIA RUSSIA AS IT WAS AND WILL BE
THEY HAD BEEN SURROUNDED AND STARVED AND THEN FIRED ON BY ARTILLERY AND MANY KILLED
COMPENSATION OF AT LEAST FULL WAGES IN ALL LOSS OF WORKING CAPACITY AND UNEMPLOYMENT
TRADE UNIONS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT UPON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE TO BEGIN LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ALL EMPLOYERS WHO VIOLATE LABOUR CONTRACTS OR LABOUR LEGISLATION AND ALSO IN BEHALF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WORKER IN ANY BRANCH OF LABOUR
SOME OF THE COFFINS WERE OPEN THE LID CARRIED BEHIND THEM
THE LAST BULLETIN SAID THAT THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAD DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM TO THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY DEMANDING THE IMMEDIATE SURRENDER OF THE KREMLIN OR BOMBARDMENT WOULD FOLLOW
SO HE AND I AND ANOTHER COMRADE WENT THERE
PUT EVERYTHING BACK
THE REVOLUTION IS LOST BUT WON'T YOU DEFEND THE REVOLUTION OF COURSE WE WILL DEFEND IT--TO THE LAST DROP OF OUR BLOOD
EVERY DAY THEY URGE POGROMS
ON NOVEMBER 16TH THE VIKZHEL MEMBERS TOOK THEIR SEATS IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 2D AT THE OPENING SESSION OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF RAILWAY WORKERS THE TSAY-EE-KAH FORMALLY OFFERED THE POST OF COMMISSAR OF WAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS TO THE VIKZHEL_--WHICH ACCEPTED
THE COMMISSAR OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE LITTLE VISHNIAK TRIED TO PERSUADE THE GIRLS TO REMAIN
RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS ANOTHER APPEAL TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD TO STAND UP FOR THE DEFENCE OF THEIR ELECTED TOWN GOVERNMENT
AVILOV KRAMAROV
THE MEMBERS OF THE GATCHINA SOVIET WERE ARRESTED AND AT FIRST THREATENED WITH DEATH
IMMEDIATE TRUCE ON ALL FRONTS
BUT NOW THE GOVERNMENT FORBIDS US EVEN TO TALK OF SUCH THINGS AND AT THE SAME TIME DOESN'T GIVE US ENOUGH FOOD TO LIVE ON OR ENOUGH AMMUNITION TO FIGHT WITH FROM EUROPE CAME RUMOURS OF PEACE AT THE EXPENSE OF RUSSIA
THIS METHOD IS THE SO-CALLED COALITION MINISTRY COMPOSED OF BOURGEOIS AND OF RENEGADES FROM THE SOCIALIST CAMP
THE BANKS AND SAVINGS BANKS SHALL SEND THE TOTALS OF DAILY CASH OPERATIONS BY 5 P
BUMAGI PAPERS SAID HE WITH CONTEMPT
ARISE COSSACKS
3 AND THAT THEY MIGHT SOON BE DISSOLVED
BY 100 DELEGATES ELECTED DIRECTLY FROM THE ARMY AND THE FLEET
THE MUNICIPALITIES MAY ISSUE ORDERS ON THE INSTITUTION OF HOUSE COMMITTEES DEFINE THEIR ORGANISATION THEIR POWERS AND GIVE THEM JURIDICAL AUTHORITY
VII SECT
I WILL GIVE YOU AN ORDER HE FELT IN HIS POCKETS
IT IS OUR DECREE--IT IS THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMME INTACT
NOW WE MUST KEEP IT THE MENSHEVIK YOFFE TRIED TO READ HIS PARTY'S DECLARATION BUT TROTZKY REFUSED TO ALLOW A DEBATE ABOUT PRINCIPLE OUR DEBATES ARE NOW IN THE STREETS HE CRIED
THE IMPENDING TRANSFORMATION OF INDUSTRY FROM A WAR TO A PEACE BASIS AND THE REDISTRIBUTION OF LABOUR ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS AMONG THE DIFFERENT FACTORIES CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT GREAT DISTURBANCES ONLY BY MEANS OF THE DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES

CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE OF PETROGRAD AND THE PETROGRAD DISTRICT LIEUTENANT-COLONEL MURAVIOV
EITHER LET THE GOVERNMENT END THE WAR OR SUPPORT THE ARMY FOR THE FORTY-SIXTH SIBERIAN ARTILLERY
I AM NOT A BOLSHEVIK HE ASSURED ME EMPHATICALLY
PROVOCATOR WERE HURLED AT HIM
TUESDAY MORNING
IN CASE OF MODIFICATION OF THE BOUNDARIES OF ALLOTMENTS THE ORIGINAL CENTRE OF THE ALLOTMENT REMAINS INTACT
MOSCOW WHERE THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD TURNED THEIR ARTILLERY AGAINST THE LAST STRONG-HOLD OF THE BOURGEOISIE--THE KREMLIN
COME COMRADES CRIED ONE THESE ARE AMERICAN TOVARISHTCHI THEY HAVE COME THIRTY THOUSAND VERSTS TO SEE OUR REVOLUTION AND THEY ARE NATURALLY TIRED WITH POLITE AND FRIENDLY APOLOGIES THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO LEAVE
AVILOV MENACES US WITH FAILURE OF OUR PEACE EFFORTS--IF WE REMAIN ISOLATED I REPEAT I DON'T SEE HOW A COALITION WITH SKOBELIEV OR EVEN TERESTCHENKO CAN HELP US TO GET PEACE
EVERYWHERE THE SAME THING HAPPENED
OUR TROOPS ARE IN PURSUIT
THE INTERFERENCE WITH OUR WORK--WHICH IS SO RUINOUS TO OUR BUSINESS--OF THE COMMISSARS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IS STILL CONTINUING
ARE YOU FOR THE SOVIETS I ASKED
AT THE END OF THE LINE ROSE THE GRACEFUL SMOKE-BLUE CUPOLAS OF SMOLNY CONVENT OUTLINED IN DULL GOLD BEAUTIFUL
RED PETROGRAD WAS IN DANGER
ALL RIGHT HE SAID RISING
THE ARMY COMMITTEES THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS AND THE TSAY-EE-KAH SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT
HERE WHERE ARE THE TOMBS OF THE TSARS OUR TSAR--THE PEOPLE--SHALL SLEEP HIS ARM WAS IN A SLING FROM A BULLET-WOUND GAINED IN THE FIGHTING
AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THE PICTURES AN ALCOHOLIC BREATH ASSAILED ME FROM THE REGION OF MY LEFT EAR AND A VOICE SAID IN THICK BUT FLUENT FRENCH I SEE BY THE WAY YOU ADMIRE THE PAINTINGS THAT YOU ARE FOREIGNERS HE WAS A SHORT PUFFY MAN WITH A BALDISH HEAD AS HE REMOVED HIS CAP
ON THE ABOLITION OF CLASSES AND TITLES 1
WHO IS FRIGHTENING YOU
JUST AS THEY TURNED INTO THE NEVSKY A TIRE BLEW OUT
THEN TOO THEY SAID THAT THE COSSACKS WERE ALWAYS ACCUSED OF BEING THE HEREDITARY ENEMIES OF DEMOCRACY
LET US SWEAR THAT EITHER THE REVOLUTION SHALL BE SAVED--OR WE SHALL PERISH THE HALL ROSE CHEERING WITH KINDLING EYES
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE PETROGRAD DEC
INSTRUCTION TO PEASANTS IN ANSWER TO THE NUMEROUS ENQUIRIES COMING FROM PEASANTS IT IS HEREBY EXPLAINED THAT THE WHOLE POWER IN THE COUNTRY IS FROM NOW ON HELD BY THE SOVIETS OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
BUT THAT IS WRONG
THE LAND FUND IS SUBJECT TO PERIODICAL REDISTRIBUTION ACCORDING TO THE INCREASE OF POPULATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND RURAL ECONOMY
GENERAL VERKHOVSKY UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS REORGANISATION OF THE ARMY ONLY CAME TO CABINET MEETINGS AT LONG INTERVALS
THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT WILSON MAY BECOME A VALUABLE AID TO INTERNATIONAL LAW PROVIDED THAT A ALL NATIONS ARE TO BE OBLIGED TO PARTICIPATE IN IT WITH EQUAL RIGHTS AND B INTERNATIONAL POLITICS ARE TO BE DEMOCRATISED
THE VICTORIOUS INSURRECTIONISTS CROWDED TO SEE BUT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW ANGRY MUTTERINGS
THIS MANIFESTO DECLARED FOR THE AUTONOMY OF LITHUANIA AND LIVONIA
COMRADE WILL YOU GO UP TO THE COMMANDANT'S HEADQUARTERS AND TAKE CHARGE
UP THE NEVSKY THE WHOLE CITY SEEMED TO BE OUT PROMENADING
THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRESS WERE INCREASED BY A DECREE SEE APP
AT TWO O'CLOCK THE LAND DECREE WAS PUT TO VOTE WITH ONLY ONE AGAINST AND THE PEASANT DELEGATES WILD WITH JOY
HUNGER IS NOT WAITING
THEY WILL VOTE TO REMAIN NEUTRAL--AND THEN THE YUNKERS AND COSSACKS THE DOOR OF THE GREAT MIKHAILOVSKY RIDING-SCHOOL YAWNED BLACKLY
IT IS NOT EASY FOR US RUSSIANS POLITICS
AND THAT THESE WORKERS BY DECISIVE ENERGETIC AND CONTINUED ACTION WILL HELP US TO BRING TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION THE CAUSE OF PEACE--AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CAUSE OF THE LIBERATION OF THE EXPLOITED WORKING MASSES FROM ALL SLAVERY AND ALL EXPLOITATION
SCHREIDER WAS ON HIS FEET PUTTING A MOTION TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DUMA PROTESTED AGAINST THE MENACE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI TO DISSOLVE IT AND AS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE POPULATION IT WOULD REFUSE TO LEAVE ITS POST
THE STATE BANK IS CLOSED
NOTHING COULD BE MORE STRIKING THAN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
THE IDEAL IS EQUAL AND IF POSSIBLE HIGHER EDUCATION FOR ALL THE CITIZENS
THE DEATH BATTALIONS WERE COMPOSED MOSTLY OF INTENSE YOUNG PATRIOTS
KAMENIEV HOWEVER MERELY ANSWERED THAT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE LEGALITY OF THE CONGRESS AS EVEN THE QUORUM ESTABLISHED BY THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH WAS EXCEEDED--IN SPITE OF THE SECESSION OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTION ARISES
I DO NOT WISH TO SAY TO THE SUCCESSES OF THE REVOLUTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE DEFEATS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY ARE VICTORIES FOR THE REVOLUTION
THE ENEMY IS FLEEING
ONE OF THEM SAID CRONSTADT IS COMING
GRAIN IS SCARCE
AN APPEAL TO THE COUNTRY WAS DRAFTED
ON THE 29TH JOINT COMMISSION OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC HASTILY DREW UP TWO LAWS ONE FOR GIVING THE LAND TEMPORARILY TO THE PEASANTS AND THE OTHER FOR PUSHING AN ENERGETIC FOREIGN POLICY OF PEACE
KAMENIEV JANGLED THE BELL SHOUTING KEEP YOUR SEATS AND WE'LL GO ON WITH OUR BUSINESS AND TROTZKY STANDING UP WITH A PALE CRUEL FACE LETTING OUT HIS RICH VOICE IN COOL CONTEMPT ALL THESE SO-CALLED SOCIALIST COMPROMISERS THESE FRIGHTENED MENSHEVIKI SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES BUND_--LET THEM GO
WE WELCOME INTO THE GOVERNMENT ALL PARTIES AND GROUPS WHICH WILL ADOPT OUR PROGRAMME ENDED TROTZKY
BUT THE TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH LINES WERE CUT
THERE'S A MEETING ON TO DECIDE
THE DAUGHTER OF A FRIEND OF MINE CAME HOME ONE AFTERNOON IN HYSTERICS BECAUSE THE WOMAN STREET-CAR CONDUCTOR HAD CALLED HER COMRADE ALL AROUND THEM GREAT RUSSIA WAS IN TRAVAIL BEARING A NEW WORLD
I'M GOING NOW ANSWERED TROTZKY AND LEFT THE PLATFORM
WHEN THE SOVIETS HAVE ALL THE POWER THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT IS GUARANTEED AND ITS SUCCESS ASSURED
MEANWHILE THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS LOOMED OVER RUSSIA LIKE A THUNDER-CLOUD SHOT THROUGH WITH LIGHTNINGS
MEANWHILE THE HIGHER FUNCTIONARIES OF THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS BANKS RAILROADS POST AND TELEGRAPH ARE ON STRIKE AND IMPEDING THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT IN SUPPLYING THE FRONT WITH PROVISIONS

IT WAS NO LONGER EASY TO GET IN
TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF DISARMAMENT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2 A SPECIAL COMMISSION IS APPOINTED CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL ORGANISATIONS WHICH TOOK PART IN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
NO ANSWERED THE YUNKERS ONE BY ONE
THIS WAS THE VOICE OF THE SOLDIERS--THE STIRRING MILLIONS OF UNIFORMED WORKERS AND PEASANTS WERE MEN LIKE THEM AND THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WERE THE SAME
QUIET LAY THE CITY
HAS DECLARED THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OVERTHROWN AND HAS DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENTAL POWER BE TURNED OVER TO IT UNDER THREAT OF BOMBARDING THE WINTER PALACE WITH THE CANNON OF PETER-PAUL FORTRESS AND OF THE CRUISER AVRORA ANCHORED IN THE NEVA
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS WAS AT FIRST COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF BOLSHEVIKI
THE MAYOR'S PERSON AND THAT OF ALL THE MEMBERS WERE INVIOLABLE
WE COULD SEE HER BEING LIFTED INTO A CAB SURROUNDED BY AN EXCITED THRONG THE CLAMOUR OF WHOSE VOICES FLOATED UP TO US
OUR BROTHERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN IN THE STREETS
DECREE ON THE MONOPOLY OF ADVERTISEMENTS 1
TWO OLD PEASANTS BOWED WITH TOIL WERE WALKING HAND IN HAND THEIR FACES ILLUMINED WITH CHILD-LIKE BLISS
THEY LIKED HIM NO MORE THAN THE OTHER
WHEN THE TRAIN BACKED INTO THE STATION A MOB OF SHABBY SOLDIERS ALL CARRYING HUGE SACKS OF EATABLES STORMED THE DOORS SMASHED THE WINDOWS AND POURED INTO ALL THE COMPARTMENTS FILLING UP THE AISLES AND EVEN CLIMBING ONTO THE ROOF
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET DEMANDED THAT NO ORDERS BE ISSUED WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE SOLDIERS SECTION
ON A COLD GREY DAY HE HAD STOOD AT A CORNER OF THE NIKITSKAYA WHICH WAS SWEPT BY BLASTS OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED THE DANGER--THE RULING CLASSES INTENSIFY IT
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT CREATED BY THE REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER 6TH AND 7TH AND BASED ON THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES PROPOSES TO ALL THE BELLIGERENT PEOPLES AND TO THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY NEGOTIATIONS FOR A JUST AND DEMOCRATIC PEACE
THE FIRST ACT OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS WAS TO DEMAND TEN MILLION RUBLES AND ON NOVEMBER 27TH THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS WITHOUT ANY INDICATION AS TO WHERE THIS MONEY WAS TO GO
NEVER MIND HE SAID FINALLY
NATURALLY PEACE IS IMMEDIATELY SIGNED
THERE WERE THE SOVIETS
EACH GROUP OF CITIZENS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO PRINT SHOPS AND PAPER
A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY ABOUT WAR TO VICTORY
ELECTIONS TO THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE BEING CONDUCT IN A BETTER AND MORE DEMOCRATIC WAY THAN THE ELECTIONS TO THE SOVIETS
SLAY BURN ROB AND THEN WILL BEGIN A TERRIBLE CONFUSION A WAR BETWEEN ONE PART OF THE PEOPLE AND THE OTHER
RIABTSEV COMMANDANT OF THE CITY A MAN OF DEMOCRATIC INSTINCTS HAD HESITATED ABOUT OPPOSING THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
YOU ARE AN EDUCATED MAN THAT IS EASY TO SEE AND I AM ONLY A SIMPLE MAN
AND WHEN THE FACTORIES OF PETROGRAD WERE ABOUT TO CLOSE DOWN FOR LACK OF COAL THE SAILORS OF THE BALTIC FLEET TURNED OVER TO THE WORKERS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POODS FROM THE BUNKERS OF BATTLE-SHIPS
OVER THE BARRICADE OF FIREWOOD WE CLAMBERED AND LEAPING DOWN INSIDE GAVE A TRIUMPHANT SHOUT AS WE STUMBLED ON A HEAP OF RIFLES THROWN DOWN BY THE YUNKERS WHO HAD STOOD THERE
REMEMBER THERE WILL BE NO OTHER WARNING BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS

AND I AM OPPOSED TO THE BOLSHEVIKI WHO ARE DESTROYING OUR RUSSIA OUR FREE REVOLUTION
ALARMED THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES IN CONTROL OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH DECIDED THAT AFTER ALL THEY FEARED THE DANGER OF KORNILOV LESS THAN THE DANGER OF LENIN

RAILWAYMEN POSTMEN TELEGRAPHERS--ALL ALL SUPPORT THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE APPENDIX TO CHAPTER X 1
THE IMMENSE SOUND ROLLED THROUGH THE HALL BURST WINDOWS AND DOORS AND SEARED INTO THE QUIET SKY
BUT SUPPOSE KORNILOV WAITS FOR STARVATION FOR THE OPENING OF THE FRONTS WHAT THEN
THE PRINTING OF ADVERTISEMENTS IN NEWSPAPERS BOOKS BILL-BOARDS KIOSKS IN OFFICES AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS IS DECLARED TO BE A STATE MONOPOLY
FOR EACH REVOLUTIONIST KILLED SAID TROTZKY WE SHALL KILL FIVE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS DOWN-TOWN AGAIN
THE PETROGRAD ANTI-BOLSHEVIK PAPERS CAME OUT NEXT DAY WITH HEADLINES PLEKHANOV'S TEMPERATURE 39 DEGREES PLEKHANOV LIVED AT TSARSKOYE SELO WHERE HE WAS LYING ILL IN BED
EVERYBODY WAS SMILING
PUBLIC WELFARE MADAME KOLLONTAI
THE INDEPENDENT WORK OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS ESTABLISHING ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL ORGANISATIONS MUST BE GIVEN FULL AUTONOMY BOTH BY THE STATE CENTRE AND THE MUNICIPAL CENTRES
THEY'LL NEVER FIGHT AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE COLONEL SEEMED SURPRISED
IT WAS THE KORNILOVITZ BEFORE HIM
ENGELS AND MARX SAID THAT THE PROLETARIAT HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE POWER UNTIL IT WAS READY FOR IT
THEIR OWN OFFICERS COULD NOT STOP THE TERRIBLE BOMBARDMENT
YES
NOW A BOLSHEVIK WAS SPEAKING ONE OF THEIR OWN MEN VIOLENTLY FULL OF HATE
ON THE CONTRARY OPENLY AUDACIOUSLY WITHOUT MINCING WORDS WITHOUT DISSIMULATING THEIR INTENTIONS THEY MULTIPLIED THEIR AGITATION INTENSIFIED THEIR PROPAGANDA IN THE FACTORIES THE BARRACKS AT THE FRONT IN THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE EVEN FIXING IN ADVANCE THE DATE OF THEIR TAKING UP ARMS THE DATE OF THEIR SEIZURE OF THE POWER

TWO HOURS LATER HE WAS PROMISED SOME YUNKERS THEN THE ORDER WAS FORGOTTEN
THIS CANNOT GO ON MUCH LONGER
THIS PAPER ADVOCATES THE FOLLOWING
THE CLOCK OVER THE SPASSKAYA GATE WAS SMASHED
IT WAS A RAW CHILL DAY
AS WE FOLLOWED THEM OUT THE DUMA WAS APPOINTING ANOTHER COMMISSION TO MEET KERENSKY--TO TRY AND AVOID BLOODSHED WHEN HE ENTERED THE CAPITAL
THIS WAS THE PARTY OF THE SOCIALIST INTELLECTUALS WHICH MEANS
AND PRETTY SOON BACK CAME THE ORDER TO LET EVERYBODY GO AND NOT ARREST ANYBODY ELSE
THEN BORIS REINSTEIN DELEGATE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY
YOU ARE FOREIGNERS HE RAPIDLY ASKED IN FRANCH
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMEN'S BATTALION WE ASKED
AND ALSO THE DISILLUSIONMENT IN ALLIED COUNTRIES WHICH FOLLOWED THE RUSSIAN DEFEAT
THE WORKING CLASS AND THE EMPLOYING CLASS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON DISPERSED BY COSSACKS SOME WERE LOCKED OUT BY THE MINE-OWNERS AND THE REST DECLARED A GENERAL STRIKE
FROM THE ORNATE ENTRANCE HALL A CEREMONIAL STAIRCASE LED UPWARD LIGHTED BY GLITTERING LUSTRES
NOW THERE ARE TWO CLASSES THE BOURGEOISIE AND THE PROLETARIAT YOU ARE A FOOL
WHEN LANDS ARE RETURNED TO THE LAND FUND THE MONEY EXPENDED FOR MANURING OR IMPROVING THE LAND WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EXHAUSTED SHALL BE REIMBURSED
THE MODERATE SOCIALIST INTELLECTUALS OFFICERS MEMBERS OF ARMY COMMITTEES THE TSAY-EE-KAH WERE THERE IN FORCE
PAY NO ATTENTION TO THESE LIES
TAKE OVER THEIR GRAIN THEIR INVENTORIED PROPERTY AND LIVE-STOCK FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE LANDS OF THE TOILING COSSACKS WHO ARE RUINED BY THE WAR
DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE WIDE SQUARE WAS DRAWN A LINE OF SOLDIERS RIFLES READY STARING AT THE HOTEL ROOF
THE POSSIBILITY OF A PEACEFUL OUTCOME LIES IN THE FORMATION OF A UNITED DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITY
AS I LEFT SMOLNY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I NOTICED THAT TWO RAPID-FIRING GUNS HAD BEEN MOUNTED ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR AND THAT STRONG PATROLS OF SOLDIERS GUARDED THE GATES AND THE NEAR-BY STREET-CORNERS
PINNED TO THE WALL BY THE PRESSURE OF THE REVOLUTION CRIED RABOTCHI PUT THE GOVERNMENT OF PROVISIONAL BOURGEOIS TRIES TO GET FREE BY GIVING OUT LYING ASSURANCES THAT IT NEVER THOUGHT OF FLEEING FROM PETROGRAD AND THAT IT DIDN'T WISH TO SURRENDER THE CAPITAL
DAN SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE RIGHT MENSHEVIKI PROPOSED TO THE BOLSHEVIKI THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS FOR A TRUCE
COMING HOME FROM AN ALL-NIGHT MEETING I HAVE SEEN THE KVOST TAIL BEGINNING TO FORM BEFORE DAWN MOSTLY WOMEN SOME WITH BABIES IN THEIR ARMS
THE OFFICER DETAILED TO THE WORK WAS PROMISED A SQUAD OF SOLDIERS
KERENSKY FLED FROM THE CITY ABANDONING THE AUTHORITY TO KISHKIN WHO WANTED TO SURRENDER THE CAPITAL TO THE GERMANS
RARELY HAS LESS BLOOD BEEN SPILLED AND RARELY HAS AN INSURRECTION SUCCEEDED SO WELL
ON THE CONTRARY HUNDREDS OF NEWCOMERS FILTERED IN FILLING THE GREAT ROOM SOLID WITH STERN-FACED SOLDIERS AND WORKMEN WHO STOOD FOR HOURS AND HOURS INDEFATIGABLY INTENT
WE HAVE NOT GIVEN UP THE ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN THE LAND AND WE DO NOT INTEND TO DO SO
LUNATCHARSKY A SLIGHT STUDENT-LIKE FIGURE WITH THE SENSITIVE FACE OF AN ARTIST WAS TELLING WHY THE POWER MUST BE TAKEN BY THE SOVIETS

CHRONOLOGY AND SPELLING I HAVE ADOPTED IN THIS BOOK OUR CALENDAR THROUGHOUT INSTEAD OF THE FORMER RUSSIAN CALENDAR WHICH WAS THIRTEEN DAYS EARLIER
ALMOST ALL THE INTELLIGENTZIA BEING ANTI-BOLSHEVIK THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT TO RECRUIT NEW STAFFS
I CALL UPON ALL ARMY COMMITTEES AND ORGANISATIONS TO AFFORD THEIR HELP TO THE COMMANDERS IN FULFILMENT OF THE DUTIES WITH WHICH THEY ARE CHARGED
THAT WHICH IS HAPPENING AT MOSCOW IS A HORRIBLE IRREPARABLE MISFORTUNE
RABOTCHI PUT THE NEWSPAPER OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IS POURING OIL ON THE FLAMES

DO NOT LET THE ARMY DIE OF HUNGER
ORANIENBAUM YUNKERS ARRIVE IN THE CITY
WE MUST HAVE AN ALL-RUSSIAN BASIS FOR THE RISING
THE ORGANISERS OF REBELLION RECOGNISE THUS IMPLICITLY THAT THE MOST PERFECT CONDITIONS FOR THE FREE ACTION OF A POLITICAL PARTY OBTAIN NOW IN RUSSIA ADMINISTERED BY A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AT THE HEAD OF WHICH IS IN THE EYES OF THIS PARTY A USURPER AND A MAN WHO HAS SOLD HIMSELF TO THE BOURGEOISIE THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT KERENSKY
THE ROAD WAS CROWDED WITH THE PROLETARIAN ARMY GOING HOME AND NEW RESERVES POURING OUT TO TAKE THEIR PLACES
COMRADE ZALKIND PICKED UP ONE PART I THE OTHER WE PUT THEM ON OUR SHOULDERS AND WALKED OUT--AND NOT A SINGLE MAN SAID A WORD DO YOU KNOW HOW THE WINTER PALACE WAS CAPTURED ASKED A THIRD MAN A SAILOR
THE BOURGEOISIE AND ITS GENERALS WANT TO RESTORE A BLIND DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY
NOT BY AN ACCORD BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS FOR A LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS BUT BY THE DISARMING OF THESE GOVERNMENTS AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATISATION OF THE MILITARY SYSTEM HE ATTACKED MARTOV VICIOUSLY AND THEN TURNED ON THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHOM HE ACCUSED OF ENTERING THE GOVERNMENT AS MINISTERS WITH THE AVOWED PURPOSE OF CARRYING ON THE CLASS STRUGGLE
THESE ARE INDICATED BY A REFERENCE TO THE PAGE NUMBER IN THE ORIGINAL BOOK TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD BY JOHN REED TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE

I AM GENERAL ALEXEYEV HE CRIED
STORMY WAS THE ALL-NIGHT MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET THE 30TH OF OCTOBER AT WHICH I WAS PRESENT
HE WAS EFFUSIVELY POLITE
THEIR MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICE AMONG THE PEASANTS
WHICH BASING ITSELF ON THE FORCES OF DEMOCRACY WILL CONDUCT THE COUNTRY TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND SAVE IT FROM ANARCHY AND COUNTER-REVOLUTION
IT WAS ALREADY DARK AND ON THE ICE--COVERED SNOW GLITTERED THE PALE LIGHT OF MOON AND STAR
AT MOSCOW WHERE THE SITUATION WAS AGGRAVATED BY A GREAT STRIKE OF LEATHER-WORKERS ON ONE SIDE AND A THREAT OF GENERAL LOCK-OUT ON THE OTHER THE SOVIETS HAD VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO SUPPORT THE ACTION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IN PETROGRAD
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER 1917 A GROUP OF SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY LEADERS PAID A PRIVATE VISIT TO SIR GEORGE BUCHANAN THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR AND IMPLORED HIM NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSIDERED TOO FAR RIGHT AND TO THINK SAID SIR GEORGE
AND EVEN AFTER THE RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE THEY CONTINUED THEIR CAMPAIGN AT A MEETING OF THE PARTY WORKERS
AVANESSOV FOR THE LENINITES HASTILY PROPOSED THAT THE QUESTION OF THE PRESS BE POSTPONED UNTIL AFTER SOME COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE SOCIALIST PARTIES HAD BEEN REACHED

HE WAS ANSWERED THAT THE FIRING WOULD CEASE WHEN KERENSKY LAID DOWN HIS ARMS
BETWEEN THE FACTORY-WORKERS CAME COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS WITH THEIR COFFINS TOO AND SQUADRONS OF CAVALRY RIDING AT SALUTE AND ARTILLERY BATTERIES THE CANNON WOUND WITH RED AND BLACK--FOREVER IT SEEMED
THE BOLSHEVIKI DEMANDED THAT THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS BE SUMMONED AND THAT THEY TAKE OVER THE POWER
THE CITY DUMAS ARE ELECTED BY UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND IN PURELY LOCAL MATTERS HAVE MORE AUTHORITY THAN THE SOVIETS
THE RECEIVER'S OFF THE HOOK SEND HIM A TELEGRAM I DID WELL WITH WHAT RESULT MARAT-URITZKY SIGHS AND DOES NOT ANSWER
AN OFFICER STRODE IN A RED BAND AROUND HIS ARM DEMANDING THE MAYOR
TO MOVE OUT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF WORKERS FOR THE DIGGING OF TRENCHES THE ERECTION OF BARRICADES AND REINFORCING OF WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS
IN THE STREETS COULD BE HEARD THE DULL RUMBLE OF DISTANT CANNONADING SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PARQUETTED FLOOR LAY ROWS OF DIRTY MATTRESSES AND BLANKETS UPON WHICH OCCASIONAL SOLDIERS WERE STRETCHED OUT
AT THE PRESENT MOMENT THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND IN SPITE OF THE MENACE OF THE EXTERNAL ENEMY HAVING REMOVED BY ARMED FORCE THE ONLY LEGAL REVOLUTIONARY AUTHORITY IS MAKING AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE RIGHTS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT DEMANDING SUBMISSION TO ITS COMMISSARS AND ITS ILLEGAL AUTHORITY
AT EVERY MENTION OF THE WORD UNION THERE WAS ECSTATIC APPLAUSE
BUT HERE WHAT HAVE WE
AFTER A MOMENT THE AUTOMOBILE WHEELED UNDECIDEDLY AROUND AND WENT OFF UP THE NEVSKY WHILE SOME HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN PICKED THEMSELVES UP AND BEGAN TO DUST THEIR CLOTHES
IT WAS WAR--WAR DELIBERATELY PLANNED RUSSIAN FASHION
IMAGINE THIS STRUGGLE BEING REPEATED IN EVERY BARRACKS OF THE CITY THE DISTRICT THE WHOLE FRONT ALL RUSSIA

MEMBERS OF THE PEASANT LAND COMMITTEES IMPRISONED BY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WERE DECLARED FREE

DOWN WITH THE TRAITORS SHINGARIOV CADET THEN DEMANDED THAT ALL MUNICIPAL FUNCTIONARIES WHO HAD CONSENTED TO BE COMMISSARS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE BE DISCHARGED FROM THEIR POSITION AND INDICTED

HORRIBLY MUCH
THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF DELEGATES WAS
WE ARE GOING TO THE WINTER PALACE THE SAILOR WAS PLAINLY PUZZLED
A HUGE MEETING OF THE SAILORS ON THE BATTLESHIPS IN THE HARBOUR HAD FORCED THEIR OFFICERS TO LINE UP AND SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
DARK AND SILENT AND COLD WERE THE CHURCHES
RISING HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WALKED OUT ON THE RADIATOR PUT HIS HANDS ON HIS HIPS AND LOOKED AROUND SMILING A SQUAT SHORT-LEGGED FIGURE BARE-HEADED WITHOUT INSIGNIA ON HIS UNIFORM
DAN'S TACTICS PROVE THAT THE MASSES--THE GREAT DULL INDIFFERENT MASSES--ARE ABSOLUTELY WITH HIM TITANTIC MIRTH HE TURNED TOWARD THE CHAIRMAN DRAMATICALLY
WITHOUT PRE-DETERMINING IT THE NEW PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS ITSELF WITHIN ITS RIGHTS IN ENACTING IN THIS DOMAIN A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH AIM AT ENRICHING AND ENLIGHTENING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE SPIRITUAL LIFE OF THE COUNTRY
BRUTES
WE ARE UNARMED
BOTH IN RUSSIA AND ABROAD THE SENSATION WAS TREMENDOUS
I BRING YOU GREETINGS FROM THE PLACE WHERE MEN ARE DIGGING THEIR GRAVES AND CALL THEM TRENCHES THEN AROSE A TALL GAUNT YOUNG SOLDIER WITH FLASHING EYES MET WITH A ROAR OF WELCOME
1 HIMSELF RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND ALL THE CHURCH-BELLS CLAMOURING
APPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT THE DETACHMENTS AT GATCHINA DECEIVED BY KERENSKY HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS AND DECIDED TO ARREST KERENSKY
THE BOLSHEVIKI SEEM ANXIOUS FOR AN AGREEMENT IF THEY LAST THAT LONG LAUGHED THE CITY ENGINEER A STOUT RUDDY MAN
WHILE AGREEING IN PRINCIPLE HIS FACTION COULD NOT VOTE ON THE QUESTION UNTIL AFTER DISCUSSION
A PAIR OF SHOES COST MORE THAN A HUNDRED RUBLES AND AS WAGES AVERAGED ABOUT THIRTY-FIVE RUBLES A MONTH THE SERVANTS REFUSED TO STAND IN QUEUE AND WEAR OUT THEIR SHOES
WE WALKED RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM UNCOUPLED THE MACHINE-GUN
GORKY'S PAPER NOVAYA ZHIZN AGREED WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI THAT THE REACTIONARIES WERE ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THE REVOLUTION AND THAT IF NECESSARY THEY MUST BE RESISTED BY FORCE OF ARMS
NATURALLY MOST OF IT DEALS WITH RED PETROGRAD THE CAPITAL AND HEART OF THE INSURRECTION
COMMANDERS OF FRONTS ARE ELECTED BY CONGRESSES OF THE RESPECTIVE FRONTS
THERE CAN BE NO NEUTRALS NOW HE SAID
BUT IT WAS NOT TRUE THAT THEY HAD JOINED THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS
THE REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER 6TH AND 7TH HE ENDED HAS OPENED THE ERA OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION
THE STATE COMMITTEE ON PEOPLE'S EDUCATION A WHOLE SERIES OF INVALUABLE LAW PROJECTS WAS ELABORATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION BY THE STATE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S EDUCATION A TOLERABLY DEMOCRATIC BODY AS TO ITS COMPOSITION AND RICH IN EXPERTS
WE WILL OBEY ONLY THE ORDERS OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET THROUGH THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE LOCAL MILITARY UNITS WERE ORDERED TO WAIT FOR INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SOLDIERS SECTION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
PASSING TO TERESTCHENKO'S SPEECH HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY ACCUSED HIM OF BEING AFRAID TO SPEAK THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND AND EVEN AFRAID TO THINK IN TERMS OF THE GREATNESS OF RUSSIA
THE CHAIRMAN PRESENTED ME AND SHAKING HANDS WENT BACK
THE PEACE TERMS ARE TO BE CONFIRMED BY THESE PARLIAMENTS
THE WORK IN THE FACTORIES AND ALL THE INDUSTRIES IS NECESSARY FOR THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF SOVIETS BECAUSE ANY INTERRUPTION OF THIS WORK WILL ONLY CREATE NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR US AND WE HAVE ENOUGH AS IT IS
THE INSURRECTION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI DEALS A MORTAL BLOW TO THE CAUSE OF NATIONAL DEFENCE AND POSTPONES IMMEASURABLY THE MOMENT OF PEACE SO GREATLY DESIRED
MOREOVER THERE IS PROBABLY NOT A PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SO WELL EDUCATED IN SOCIALIST THEORY AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION
HOWEVER THE RIGHT WING OF THE BOLSHEVIKI LED BY RIAZANOV KAMENIEV AND ZINOVIEV CONTINUED TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST AN ARMED RISING

AND LIKE THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH FINDING ITS RESISTANCE FUTILE THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SENT FRANTIC TELEGRAMS ORDERING THE ELECTION OF CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES
THE EMISSARY MUST INSIST THAT AFTER THE PEASANTS HAVE RECEIVED THE LAND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THEY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CULTIVATED LAND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THEY HASTEN THE SENDING OF GRAIN TO THE CITIES AS THE ONLY MEANS OF AVOIDING FAMINE
SILENCE FELL SHARPLY INTENSE BROKEN BY THE SCUFFLING AND DISPUTING OF THE PEOPLE AT THE DOOR
THE SOVIETS CHOSE SKOBELIEV TO SPEAK FOR THEM AND DREW UP A MANIFESTO THE FAMOUS NAKAZ_--(SEE APP
AT PULKOVO THE ROAD DIVIDED AND THERE WE HALTED IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT CROWD WHERE THE HUMAN STREAMS POURED FROM THREE DIRECTIONS FRIENDS MEETING EXCITED AND CONGRATULATORY DESCRIBING THE BATTLE TO ONE ANOTHER
THERE WERE WORKING-CLASS NEWSPAPERS SAYING NEW AND STARTLING THINGS
ON THE ALMOST DESERTED NEVSKY SWEPT BY A BITTER WIND A CROWD HAD GATHERED BEFORE THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL CONTINUING THE ENDLESS DEBATE
ALL THE GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY HAD STOPPED FUNCTIONING
AND DYBENKO THE GIANT BEARDED SAILOR WITH THE PLACID FACE
ITS OFFICIAL NAME IS PARTY OF THE PEOPLE'S FREEDOM UNDER THE TSAR COMPOSED OF LIBERALS FROM THE PROPERTIED CLASSES THE CADETS WERE THE GREAT PARTY OF POLITICAL REFORM ROUGHLY CORRESPONDING TO THE PROGRESSIVE PARTY IN AMERICA
MOSCOW
BUT IF THE HOSTILE ELEMENTS APPEAL TO FORCE THEN THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY SHOULD ENTER THE BATTLE TO SEIZE THE POWER AND IT WILL BE SUSTAINED BY THE MOST PROFOUND STRATA OF THE PEOPLE
IN SPITE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY EXALTATION OF THE TRIUMPHANT CROWD AVILOV'S COOL TOLERANT REASONING HAD SHAKEN THEM

A CONGRESS OF DELEGATES OF THE BALTIC FLEET AT HELSINGFORS PASSED A RESOLUTION WHICH BEGAN AS FOLLOWS
AS ITS FIRST TASK THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE TEACHERS STATUS AND FIRST OF ALL OF THOSE VERY POOR THOUGH ALMOST MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE WORK OF CULTURE--THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS

NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
ABOUT NOON A PEASANT WOMAN GOT ON WITH A BASKET-FULL OF BREAD-CHUNKS AND A GREAT CAN OF LUKE WARM COFFEE-SUBSTITUTE
19 DENOUNCING DUKHONIN AND THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY OFFICERS ABOUT HIM DENOUNCING THE REACTIONARY POLITICIANS GATHERED AT MOGHILEV ROUSING FROM ONE END OF THE THOUSAND-MILE FRONT TO THE OTHER MILLIONS OF ANGRY SUSPICIOUS SOLDIERS

THE MUNICIPALITIES MAY ACCORDING TO LAWS AND ARRANGEMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THEM INSTALL IN ALL AVAILABLE LODGINGS CITIZENS WHO HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE OR WHO LIVE IN CONGESTED OR UNHEALTHY LODGINGS
AT KIEV THE COSSACKS HAD OVERTHROWN THE SOVIETS AND ARRESTED ALL THE INSURRECTIONARY LEADERS
THE SOVIET AUTHORITY WILL AT ONCE PROPOSE AN IMMEDIATE DEMOCRATIC PEACE TO ALL NATIONS AND AN IMMEDIATE TRUCE ON ALL FRONTS
OPEN THE FRONTS
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF LOGIC THE FOREIGN POLICY OF RUSSIA OUGHT TO BE BASED ON A REAL COMPREHENSION OF THE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA

THE CONSTITUTION OF A PURELY BOLSHEVIK GOVERNMENT BY MEANS OF POLITICAL TERRORISM
THE PROLETARIAT OF THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WAITING FOR THE GREAT THINGS THAT IT IS ACCOMPLISHING SVERDLOV PRESIDENT OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH GREETED THEM
ON THE 29TH IN OPEN SESSION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET TROTZKY PROPOSED THAT THE SOVIET FORMALLY SANCTION THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
MY COMRADES THE OTHER COMMISSARS CONSIDERED THIS RESIGNATION INADMISSIBLE
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF PEASANT DEPUTIES
WHAT DYBENKO TOLD THE COSSACKS NOBODY KNOWS BUT THE FACT IS THAT GENERAL KRASNOV AND HIS STAFF AND SEVERAL THOUSAND COSSACKS SURRENDERED AND ADVISED KERENSKY TO DO THE SAME
IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE STAFF AND BY THAT TIME MOST OF THEM WERE GONE
STEPAN GEORGEVITCH YOU WILL PLEASE RAPIDLY TRACING LINES WITH A BLUE PENCIL HE GAVE HIS ORDERS WHILE A SERGEANT MADE SHORTHAND NOTES
THAT ALL LOCAL POWER SHALL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES WHICH MUST ENFORCE REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
THAT LEFT ONLY THE YUNKERS HOW ABOUT THE COSSACKS THE OFFICER SIGHED
MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY KONOVALOV APPOINTED HIS ASSISTANT ORLOV WITH PLENARY POWERS TO SETTLE THE TROUBLE
EVEN KERENSKY WAS UNDER SUSPICION
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE COSSACKS CAME TO TELL ME THAT KERENSKY WAS NOT IN HIS QUARTERS THAT HE HAD RUN AWAY
WE REFUSE TO LEND OUR SERVICES TO ANY PARTY WHICH DOES NOT ACT BY AUTHORITY OF
A BEARDED SOLDIER SHOUTED AT THEM REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID TO US BOLSHEVIKI WHEN WE WERE THE MINORITY RESULT--14 BOLSHEVIKI 7 SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES 3 MENSHEVIKI AND 1 INTERNATIONALIST GORKY'S GROUP HENDELMANN FOR THE RIGHT AND CENTRE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SAID THAT THEY REFUSED TO TAKE PART IN THE PRESIDIUM
THERE IS MUCH TO DO
LOOTING OF THE WINTER PALACE I DO NOT MEAN TO MAINTAIN THAT THERE WAS NO LOOTING IN THE WINTER PALACE
THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET WAS IN THE PALACE OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR-GENERAL AN IMPOSING WHITE BUILDING FRONTING SKOBELIEV SQUARE
COSSACK BROTHERS
COSSACK BROTHERS
THEY MUST ENTER INTO CLOSE LIAISON WITH THE DETACHMENTS OF COLPINNO AND KRASNOYE SELO AND ALSO WITH THE STAFF OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF FOR THE DEFENCE OF PETROGRAD
THE REVISION OF RULES OF REPRESENTATION IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE SENSE OF GREATER DEMOCRATISATION
I AM SORRY

KORNILOV IS RAISING THE TEKHINTSI TO REPEAT HIS ATTEMPT OF AUGUST
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE BY AGREEMENT WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS HAS DECREED THAT GENERAL KORNILOV AND ALL THE ACCOMPLICES OF HIS CONSPIRACY SHALL BE BROUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO PETROGRAD FOR INCARCERATION IN PETER-PAUL FORTRESS AND ARRAIGNMENT BEFORE A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COURT-MARTIAL
HE MADE FOR US SHOULDERING HIS WAY THROUGH
THERE IS NO ROOM ON THE MAIN STREETS WHERE THE GREAT BANKING-HOUSES AND MERCANTILE HOUSES LAY THE BOLSHEVIK ARTILLERY HAD BEEN INDISCRIMINATELY EFFECTIVE
PULKOVO
TO THE PILLORY
IF THE BOLSHEVIKI COME WE SHALL SHOW THEM HOW TO FIGHT
HOW THEN CAN THE PEOPLE CHANGE THINGS
PRESENTLY HE WILL FIRE ON THE PEOPLE APPARENTLY NO ONE THOUGHT OF GOING TO INVESTIGATE
THE REST BELONG TO A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOVIET STATE FOR WHICH I HAVE NO PLACE IN THIS WORK
BOTH PLANS MET A PITIFUL DEFEAT
WE DO NOT WANT OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY AND WE DO NOT WISH TO GIVE AWAY OUR OWN
THE CHARACTERISTIC OF BOURGEOIS GOVERNMENTS HE SAID IS TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE
THE CRUISERS OLEG AVRORA AND RESPUBLICA ARE ANCHORED IN THE NEVA THEIR GUNS TRAINED ON THE APPROACHES TO THE CITY WHY AREN'T YOU OUT THERE WITH THE RED GUARDS SHOUTED A ROUGH VOICE
WHEN AUTOCRACY AND THE WHOLE BUREAUCRATIC REGIME FELL WE SET UP THE SOVIETS AS A BARRACKS IN WHICH ALL THE DEMOCRACY COD FIND TEMPORARY SHELTER

BUT WE ARE READY
WE WILL HAVE A LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF TWO CHAMBERS SUCH AS YOU HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES
TO INFORM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY OF ALL CASES OF SPOLIATION MARAUDING SPECULATION WHICH BECOME KNOWN TO THEM
HALF A DOZEN RED GUARDS FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH A PRIEST IN THE MIDDLE
ALL THROUGH THE VILLAGES A FERMENT OF CHANGE WAS GOING ON CAUSED NOT ONLY BY THE ELECTRIFYING ACTION OF THE LAND DECREE BUT ALSO BY THOUSANDS OF REVOLUTIONARY-MINDED PEASANT-SOLDIERS RETURNING FROM THE FRONT
AND THE CENTRAL OFFICES AND CAUCUS-ROOMS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES
FOUNDED BY LIBERALS AND MODERATE SOCIALISTS THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALIST GROUPS BECAUSE IT WAS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE COMPLETE TRANSFERENCE OF MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKERS
TO FACILITATE THESE POURPARLERS THE GOVERNMENT APPOINTS ITS AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NEUTRAL COUNTRIES
THERE REMAINED AT THE CAMP ONLY THE SOLDIERS WHO SAID THEY WOULD SUBMIT CONDITIONALLY TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
RESOLUTION PASSED BY THE CONFERENCE OF BUSINESS MEN AT MOSCOW
INTO ITS HANDS THAT POWER AND AUTHORITY WHICH RESTS UPON THE ORGANISED FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLE
HE'S NOT RECEIVING TELEPHONE HIM THEN I'VE TRIED
BE THE GUARDIANS OF THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE
THEY WILL MASSACRE US THEY CRIED FOR MANY OF THEM HAD GIVEN THEIR WORD AT THE WINTER PALACE NOT TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE PEOPLE
ABOUT 2,000 REMAINED
FOR EXAMPLE COULD WE HAVE ORGANISED THE INSURRECTION WITH DAN AND AVKSENTIEV IN OUR RANKS ROARS OF LAUGHTER
THEY HAD THEIR REASON DURING THE STRUGGLE BUT NOW THEY HAVE NO FURTHER EXCUSE
WHAT WAS THE SHOOTING GOING ON AROUND HERE ONE OF THE SOLDIERS ANSWERED LOOKING RELIEVED WHY WE WERE JUST SHOOTING A RABBIT OR TWO COMRADE THE TRUCK HURTLED ON TOWARD ROMANOV THROUGH THE BRIGHT EMPTY DAY
YOU WERE PERISHING WITHOUT REASON WITHOUT PURPOSE LIKE YOUR BROTHERS-SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
THE AUDIENCE FLOWED CHANGING AND RENEWED CONTINUALLY
THE ARGUMENTS IN THIS RESOLUTION SUGGEST SINGULARLY THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE OLD BLACK HUNDREDS AND THE CENSORS OF THE TSARIST REGIME--FOR THEY ALSO TALKED OF POISONERS OF THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE TROTZKY SPOKE AT LENGTH IN FAVOUR OF THE RESOLUTION
THEY ARE CATTLE--_CANAILLE HE ANSWERED
THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE HAS MET WITH THE RESISTANCE OF THE BOURGEOISIE AND THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY GENERALS
WE ARE WEAK WE HAVE ONLY A FEW MEN LEFT IN EACH COMPANY
THE MAYOR SAID HOPEFULLY THAT THE PETROGRAD REGIMENTS WERE ASHAMED OF THEIR ACTIONS
UNLIKE THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN OPENING THE SESSION DID NOT RECOGNISE THE CONGRESS AS OFFICIAL
WHAT KIND OF A GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE DID THE BOLSHEVIKI SET UP
ECONOMIC EVOLUTION DEMANDS THE ABOLITION OF NATIONAL FRONTIERS
AT LAST A TRULY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BORN OF THE WILL OF ALL CLASSES OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THE FIRST ROUGH FORM OF THE FUTURE LIBERAL PARLIAMENTARY REGIME HAS BEEN FORMED
IN MANY CITIES MINSK MOGHILEV KHARKOV THE POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS
WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS KIND OF ANARCHY SCARCELY HAD HE STEPPED DOWN THAN A YOUNG LEAN-FACED SOLDIER WITH FLASHING EYES LEAPED TO THE PLATFORM AND DRAMATICALLY LIFTED HIS HAND
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS CONSIDERS IT INDISPENSABLE WITHOUT DELAY TO MAKE A FORMAL PROPOSAL OF ARMISTICE TO ALL THE POWERS BOTH ENEMY AND ALLIED
KRASNOV 4
FOR A WHILE WE STOOD AT THE WINDOW LOOKING DOWN ON THE SQUARE BEFORE THE PALACE WHERE THREE COMPANIES OF LONG-COATED YUNKERS WERE DRAWN UP UNDER ARMS BEING HARANGUED BY A TALL ENERGETIC-LOOKING OFFICER I RECOGNISED AS STANKIEVITCH CHIEF MILITARY COMMISSAR OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
AT THE FRONT THE DECREES ON PEACE AND LAND ARE PROVOKING GREAT ENTHUSIASM
AS WE CAME IN KAMENIEV WAS READING THE LIST OF ARRESTED MINISTERS
NOW THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE SEPARATED THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THE DEMOCRACY THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THEM IS VERY MUCH SIMPLER--AND IT IS NOT REASONABLE IN ORDER TO FIGHT AGAINST BOLSHEVISM TO WAIT UNTIL THEY MAKE A MANIFESTATION
THE WEST AND AMERICA EXPECTED FROM RUSSIA FROM THE RUSSIAN PROLETARIAT SOMETHING TREMENDOUS
AS A GREAT REVOLUTIONIST PUT IT LET US HASTEN FRIENDS TO TERMINATE THE REVOLUTION
THE SEIZURE OF POWER HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI ALONE
FROM SMOLNY INSTITUTE ALONE THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WENT OUT EVERY DAY TONS CAR-LOADS TRAIN-LOADS OF LITERATURE SATURATING THE LAND
THAT WAS ALL
THERE IT IS SAID THE COLONEL JUST AS I FOUND IT WHEN I TOOK POSSESSION THREE DAYS AGO
BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE EXERCISED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI AGAINST THE STATE BANK HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO WORK
THIS IS WHY TEMPORARY AND EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF STOPPING THE FLOW OF FILTH AND CALUMNY IN WHICH THE YELLOW AND GREEN PRESS WOULD BE GLAD TO DROWN THE YOUNG VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE
BONCH-BRUEVITCH
THE DROSHKI WITH THEIR PADDED COACHMEN TURNED INTO SLEIGHTS BOUNDING ALONG THE UNEVEN STREET AT HEADLONG SPEED THEIR DRIVERS BEARDS STIFF AND FROZEN
WE URGENTLY APPEAL TO ALL TO EXERT EVERY EFFORT SO THAT THE STOLEN OBJECTS ARE RETURNED TO THE WINTER PALACE
PEACE AT ONCE
VOLUNTEERS WERE CALLED FOR
IN APARTMENT HOUSES THE MEN TOOK TURNS AT ALL-NIGHT GUARD DUTY ARMED WITH LOADED RIFLES
WE WILL HOLD THE FORT WITH ALL OUR STRENGTH UNTIL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD RISE AND HELP US
ALL COMMON AND BARBED WIRE AVAILABLE MUST BE ASSEMBLED AND ALSO ALL IMPLEMENTS FOR THE DIGGING OF TRENCHES AND THE ERECTION OF BARRICADES
THAT PART OF THE PLAN WHICH DEALS WITH LAND-LABOUR MUST BE CARRIED OUT UNDER SUPERVISION OF THE PEASANTS AND LAND-WORKERS ORGANISATIONS
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE STUDIED THE MAP WITH A COPY OF THE ORDERS BEFORE HIM
THE READING OF THIS RESOLUTION WAS INTERRUPTED BY IRONICAL SHOUTS FROM THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND BURSTS OF INDIGNATION FROM THE INSURGENT BOLSHEVIKI
THE SOCIALIST POLITICAL PARTY--THIS IS THE VANGUARD OF THE WORKING-CLASS
IF YOU BREAK ANY LAWS WE SHALL ARREST YOU ON THE 30TH A MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE PETROGRAD REGIMENTS PASSED A RESOLUTION
TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES THE 12TH OF NOVEMBER IN A BLOODY COMBAT NEAR TSARSKOYE SELO THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY DEFEATED THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS OF KERENSKY AND KORNILOV
HE WAS LED TO THE EDGE OF THE TOWN WHERE SOME FEW HUNDRED WORKMEN HAD DUG TRENCHES AND WERE WAITING FOR THE COSSACKS
BUT YOU DID NOT INVITE US TO YOUR CONGRESS CRIES IT WAS THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH WHICH DID NOT INVITE YOU THE ORATOR PAID NO ATTENTION
EVEN THE TRUCULENT DUMA SEEMED A LITTLE STUNNED
TO MAKE THE SOLDIERS CONTINUE THE WAR
WHEN THE RELIEF CAME IT WAS MET BY A BLAST OF RIFLE-FIRE SEVERAL BEING KILLED
QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE BOURGEOISIE GRAPHIC PAGE 354 4
THE CITY STIRRED UNEASILY WAKEFUL
THE RED GUARDS OBJECTED STRENUOUSLY BUT THE SAILOR WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST INSISTED
THE DECREE OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS CONCERNING THE PRESS IS HEREWITH REPEALED
ALONG HERE THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WAS HEAVILY WOODED
OR IT IS PRESENTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE SECTION ATTACHED TO THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED BY THE CHIEF OF THE SECTION
PROSIM THEY ANSWERED HEARTILY
A PUBLIC EXECUTIONER OF PEASANTS
THEY WERE VERY YOUNG
TRAINS WENT NO FURTHER HOWEVER THAN TSARSKOYE
IT MUST ACQUIRE IN THE SHORTEST TIME UNIVERSAL LITERACY BY ORGANISING A NETWORK OF SCHOOLS ANSWERING TO THE DEMANDS OF MODERN PEDAGOGICS
AFTER THE BITTER INTERNAL PARTY STRUGGLE WE SHALL BE OBLIGED IF YOU REFUSE TO COMPROMISE TO PASS TO OPEN BATTLE OUTSIDE
ORIGINALLY THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY OF THE PEASANTS THE PARTY OF THE FIGHTING ORGANISATIONS--THE TERRORISTS
OUR TROOPS HAVE LEFT GATCHINA IN ORDER TO AVOID BLOODSHED BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THEIR MISTAKEN BROTHER-COSSACKS AND IN ORDER TO TAKE A MORE CONVENIENT POSITION WHICH IS AT PRESENT SO STRONG THAT IF KERENSKY AND HIS COMPANIONS IN ARMS SHOULD EVEN INCREASE THEIR FORCES TEN TIMES STILL THERE WOULD BE NO CAUSE FOR ANXIETY
THE ORGANISATION OF WORKERS CONTROL IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE SAME HEALTHY ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AS ARE PARTY ORGANISATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF POLITICS TRADE UNIONS IN EMPLOYMENT COOPERATIVES IN THE DOMAIN OF CONSUMPTION AND LITERARY CLUBS IN THE SPHERE OF CULTURE
TOWARD EVENING TWO SOLDIERS ON BICYCLES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE STAFF HEADQUARTERS AS DELEGATES OF THE GARRISON OF PETER-PAUL FORTRESS
I RAN OUT
AMONG THE LEADERS
IN SENDING THIS NEWS TO THE FRONT AND THE COUNTRY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE REQUESTS ALL SOLDIERS TO KEEP VIGILANT WATCH ON THE CONDUCT OF OFFICERS
WHERE'S THE MONEY HE ASKED RUDELY
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT YESTERDAY AT A MEETING OF THE COMMISSION FOR NATIONAL DEFENCE MINISTER OF WAR GENERAL VERKHOVSKY ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALL OF KORNILOV PROPOSED TO SIGN A SEPARATE PEACE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ALLIES
I CANNOT BEAR THE MONSTROUS DESTRUCTION OF BEAUTY AND TRADITION THAT AFTERNOON HIS LETTER OF RESIGNATION WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPERS
DAILY THE GOVERNMENT SEEMED TO BECOME MORE HELPLESS
YOU LIE
WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF BAYONETS
IN KAZAN A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ARRESTED THE LOCAL GARRISON STAFF AND THE COMMISSAR OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THIS WAS THE HIGHEST SALARY PAID TO ANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

FOR THIS REASON I AM GIVING HERE A FEW BRIEF DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATIONS
THEIR ACTS OF VANDALISM AND PILLAGE THEIR CRIMES THE GERMAN MENTALITY WITH WHICH THEY REGARD RUSSIA--STRICKEN DOWN BUT NOT YET SURRENDERED--HAVE ALIENATED FROM THEM THE ENTIRE PEOPLE
1 PART OF THE FAMOUS SISSON DOCUMENTS BUT MORE POTENT STILL THEY TOOK THE CRUDE SIMPLE DESIRES OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS AND FROM THEM BUILT THEIR IMMEDIATE PROGRAMME
A SPY
14 PROTESTING DEFENDING THEMSELVES SUCH AS THIS ONE
DAMAGE TO THE KREMLIN I MYSELF VERIFIED THE DAMAGE TO THE KREMLIN WHICH I VISITED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BOMBARDMENT
WHY THE STATE OF SIEGE
THE SPASSKAYA GATE OF THE KREMLIN TOTTERING
IT WAS COMPOSED OF THE MORE MODERN BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS WHO WERE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO REALISE THAT THE SOVIETS MUST BE FOUGHT BY THEIR OWN WEAPON--ECONOMIC ORGANISATION
THE GARRISON OF TSARSKOYE SELO IS ON GUARD AT THE GATES OF PETROGRAD READY TO DEFEND THE SOVIETS AND THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WILD CHEERS
COMMERCE WAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS RIAZANOV
FURTHER DETAILS WILL BE COMMUNICATED
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING
THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR FACES WAS THAT OF WHO KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO DIE
SMOLNY HAD ISSUED ANOTHER DECREE ENLARGING THE POWERS OF THE CITY DUMAS TO DEAL WITH FOOD SUPPLIES
OUR COMMISSARS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM THEIR POSTS
YOU SEE I AM CHAIRMAN OF A COMMISSION APPOINTED FROM THIS BODY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK OUT A CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT
THE GARRISON MOREOVER DECLARES THAT WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT IT ASSURES THE MAINTENANCE OF REVOLUTIONARY ORDER IN PETROGRAD
VOSKRESSENSKY D
SMOLNY THRILLED WITH THE BOUNDLESS VITALITY OF INEXHAUSTIBLE HUMANITY IN ACTION
THE VOLOST A GROUP OF SEVERAL VILLAGES FORMS A VOLOST LAND COMMITTEES ARE IMMEDIATELY TO TAKE OVER ALL LAND FROM THE LANDLORDS AND TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT OVER IT WATCHING THAT ORDER BE MAINTAINED AND THAT THE WHOLE ESTATE BE WELL GUARDED SEEING THAT FROM NOW ON ALL PRIVATE ESTATES BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY AND MUST THEREFORE BE PROTECTED BY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
THE BANK CLERKS RETURNED TO THEIR JOBS
THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS SHOULD CONFISCATE ALL PRINTING-PLANTS CRIES CONFISCATE THE PRINTING-SHOP OF PRAVDA THE MONOPOLY OF THE PRESS BY THE BOURGEOISIE MUST BE ABOLISHED
I MOVE THAT THEY BE GIVEN VOTES ACCEPTED
THERE IS NO NATIONALISM IN THIS CRISIS
MOREOVER I WANT TO WARN YOU NOW THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOUR DEMANDS HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GREAT BURST OF LAUGHTER
WE CALL UPON YOU FOR REVOLUTIONARY DEVOTION AND DISCIPLINE
THE SENTRIES DECLARED THAT I MUST GO WITH THEM
DUMA MEMBERS WENT FROM BARRACKS TO BARRACKS ARGUING AND PLEADING NARRATING FEARFUL STORIES OF BOLSHEVIK VIOLENCE--MASSACRE OF THE YUNKERS IN THE WINTER PALACE RAPE OF THE WOMEN SOLDIERS THE SHOOTING OF THE GIRL BEFORE THE DUMA THE MURDER OF PRINCE TUMANOV
ABOVE ALL WE WANT TO FINISH THE WAR IT WAS EXACTLY 10:35 WHEN KAMENIEV ASKED ALL IN FAVOUR OF THE PROCLAMATION TO HOLD UP THEIR CARDS
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE OF THE PETERSBURG SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES GIVES HIM THE RIGHT OF FREE TRAVEL THROUGH THE ENTIRE NORTHERN FRONT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPORTING TO OUR AMERICAN COMRADES--INTERNATIONALISTS CONCERNING EVENTS IN RUSSIA
YES DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LAND DECREE IS
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU WILL LAST
THE GOVERNMENT TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO A MORE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
THE FULL-POWERED CONGRESS OF PEASANTS SOVIETS MET ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS
TO-DAY THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ARE INCLINED TO ADMIT THE BOLSHEVIKI INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUCH DOUBTS AND SIDING POLITICALLY WITH THE BOURGEOISIE
OTHERWISE IT ISN'T WORTH WHILE FOR US TO TAKE THE POWER
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES PROTESTS AGAINST THE ARREST OF OUR COMRADES THE MINISTERS SALAZKIN AND MAZLOV HE FLUNG HARSHLY IN THE FACES OF THE CROWD WE DEMAND THEIR INSTANT RELEASE
AND MOST OF THE RANK AND FILE WHO WERE FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI
IT HAS NOT AROUSED THE PATRIOTISM OF THE MASSES
THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION WAS BEING PUT DOWN
BASED DIRECTLY UPON THE ARMY IN THE TRENCHES THE WORKERS IN THE FACTORIES AND THE PEASANTS IN THE FIELDS THEY ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE REVOLUTION
THE CONCILIATORS AND PACIFISTS SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND MENSHEVIKI HAVE LOST ALL AUTHORITY--BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PEASANTS AND THE LANDLORDS BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS AND THE OFFICERS HAS BECOME MORE BITTER MORE IRRECONCILABLE THAN EVER
IN LOUISE BRYANT'S BOOK SIX RED MONTHS IN RUSSIA THERE IS AN INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF THE GIRL-SOLDIERS DURING THIS TIME
THE CHURCH OF VASILI BLAZHEINY A SMOKING RUIN
THIS SENTIMENT WAS SHARED BY THE DOMINANT MODERATE SOCIALIST GROUPS THE OBORONTSI SEE APP
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES ADDRESSES YOU BUT IT WAS THE MODERATE SOCIALIST JOURNALS WHICH WERE THE MOST HOSTILE
SCARCELY HAD THE MEETING FORMALLY OPENED BEFORE NOGIN WAS ASSAILED WITH A TEMPEST OF JEERS AND ANGRY SHOUTS
HE THEN READ THE RESOLUTION OF THE TWO FACTIONS
AT A TIME WHEN BOLSHEVIK SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ARE DYING WITH OTHER SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AS A RESULT OF THE MISTAKES AND CRIMES OF OTHERS THE SO-CALLED SUPREME COMMANDER KERENSKY CONTINUES TO SUPPRESS THE BOLSHEVIK PRESS
AT THE SAME TIME KAMENIEV RYKOV MILIUTIN ZINOVIEV AND NOGIN RESIGNED FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY MAKING PUBLIC THEIR REASONS
THE SAILORS AND RED GUARDS WERE EMBARRASSED
THE COSSACKS OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISON TO THEIR HONOUR HAVE NOT JUSTIFIED THE HOPE OF THE PEOPLE'S ENEMIES
AND BEYOND A LOWERING SKY OVER FINLAND
WHEN WE CAME OUT ON THE MORSKAYA AGAIN IT WAS QUITE DARK EXCEPT FOR ONE FLICKERING STREET-LIGHT ON THE CORNER OF THE NEVSKY
WEDNESDAY MORNING NOVEMBER 28TH AFTER A TERRIBLE ALL-NIGHT STRUGGLE AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED
AFTER THE BOLSHEVIK COUP D'ETAT YEDINSTVO DISAPPEARED
THE CONFIDING IGNORANT MEN BELIEVE THEY DO NOT REASON
A VOTE WAS TAKEN
THE COLPINNO DETACHMENT WAS ON OUR LEFT THE KRASNOYE SELO DETACHMENT TO OUR RIGHT
ON THE MORNING OF THE 13TH THEY SUMMONED TO A JOINT CONFERENCE SIXTY DELEGATES FROM THE FRONT IN ORDER TO FIND SOME WAY TO STOP THE CIVIL WAR
WHAT REGIMENT IS IT THE BRUNNOVIKI HERE WAS INDEED SERIOUS TROUBLE
IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE REVOLUTION FOR EXAMPLE THE RESERVE FOOD-SUPPLIES WERE ALMOST OPENLY LOOTED FROM THE GREAT MUNICIPAL WAREHOUSES OF PETROGRAD UNTIL THE TWO-YEARS PROVISION OF GRAIN HAD FALLEN TO LESS THAN ENOUGH TO FEED THE CITY FOR ONE MONTH
LUNATCHARSKY
THE FOREIGN EMBASSIES RECOGNISE ONLY SUCH DOCUMENTS AS ARE SIGNED BY THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN
OR IF FOR EXAMPLE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MANIFESTS ANY UTOPIAN TENDENCIES IT CAN BE DISPERSED BY FORCE OF ARMS WINTER WAS COMING ON--THE TERRIBLE RUSSIAN WINTER
UNTIL FURTHER ORDER THE PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLIC DRINKS IS PROHIBITED
IN THE SOVIET ROOM A SAMOVAR HAD BEEN SET UP AND FIFTY OR MORE WORKERS SOLDIERS SAILORS AND OFFICERS STOOD AROUND DRINKING TEA AND TALKING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
F
WE HAVE DECIDED TO DIE RATHER THAN GIVE UP FOLLOWED HIM A COMMISSAR FROM TSARSKOYE SELO PANTING AND COVERED WITH THE MUD OF HIS RIDE
WE SHALL DIE SOONER THAN SURRENDER OUR POST AMID VIOLENT APPLAUSE IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNION OF RAILWAY WORKERS HAD JOINED THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
THE SOVIETS MUST REMAIN A REVOLVER AT THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND TO SUPPRESS ANY FURTHER KORNILOV ATTEMPTS
ANY ILLEGAL ACTS ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION DISCOVERED BY THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES OR ANY SUSPICION OF SUCH ILLEGAL ACTS WHICH CANNOT BE INVESTIGATED OR REMEDIED BY THE WORKERS ALONE SHALL BE REFERRED TO THE DISTRICT CENTRAL ORGANISATION OF FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES CHARGED WITH THE PARTICULAR BRANCH OF LABOUR INVOLVED WHICH SHALL DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE INSTITUTIONS CHARGED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PLAN AND FIND MEANS TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF CONFISCATING THE FACTORY
PEACE WITHOUT ANNEXATIONS AND WITHOUT INDEMNITIES
IT IS VERY DANGEROUS IN THE STREETS JUST NOW
BANDS OF SAILORS AND RED GUARDS SCOURED THE WAREHOUSES THE RAILWAY TERMINALS EVEN THE BARGES IN THE CANALS UNEARTHING AND CONFISCATING THOUSANDS OF POODS OF FOOD HELD BY PRIVATE SPECULATORS
ON THE EQUALITY OF RANK OF ALL MILITARY MEN IN REALISATION OF THE WILL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE REGARDING THE PROMPT AND DECISIVE ABOLITION OF ALL REMNANTS OF FORMER INEQUALITY IN THE ARMY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS DECREES
THE MOST AMAZING ASSORTMENT OF OBJECTS WERE THUS CONFISCATED
GRUMBLING EACH RED GUARD PRODUCED HIS DIRTY BUMAGA PAPER ALL WERE ALIKE EXCEPT MINE WHICH HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY STAFF AT SMOLNY
2 ADMITTING MORE DELEGATES FROM THE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND OTHER CONSERVATIVE BODIES
RED GUARDS ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE AND SEARCHED IT FOR ARMS QUESTIONING THE OLD MAN
AHEAD OF US IS THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WHICH WILL SOLVE ALL QUESTIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND WHOSE COMPOSITION WILL BE ESSENTIALLY DEMOCRATIC
AT HALF-PAST TWO THE YUNKERS HOISTED A WHITE FLAG
WE WARN THE MOSCOW WORKERS AND SOLDIERS TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
I CALL UPON ALL DELEGATES TO LEAVE THIS HALL IN ORDER TO SAVE THE COUNTRY AND THE REVOLUTION AS HE WENT DOWN THE AISLE IN THE MIDST OF A DEAFENING NOISE PEOPLE SURGED IN UPON HIM THREATENING
THE FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE MODELLED ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY
GOVERNMENT OF USURPERS YES LIKE ALL REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENTS WHICH TRIUMPH OVER THEIR ADVERSARIES
COMRADES SOLDIERS
SMOLNY WAS ALMOST DESERTED EXCEPT FOR THE GUARDS WHO WERE BUSY AT THE HALL WINDOWS SETTING UP MACHINE-GUNS TO COMMAND THE FLANKS OF THE BUILDING
ALL THESE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHO CALL UPON YOU NOW TO PREVENT CIVIL WAR--HOW HAVE THEY RETAINED THE POWER EXCEPT BY CIVIL WAR THAT CIVIL WAR WHICH HAS ENDURED EVER SINCE LAST JULY AND IN WHICH THEY CONSTANTLY STOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE BOURGEOISIE AS THEY DO NOW
BUT LENIN WITH TROTZKY BESIDE HIM STOOD FIRM AS A ROCK
THE FINANCIALLY AMBITIOUS HOWEVER WERE CHECKED BY THE DECREE ON SALARIES OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES FIXING THE SALARIES OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS--THE HIGHEST--AT FIVE HUNDRED RUBLES ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH
CHAPTER 3
IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT THE SPEAKS OF THE PETERSBURG INSTEAD OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
ANOTHER SOLDIER SAT AT A TABLE BEHIND THEM WITH PEN AND PAPER
UNTIL THE CONSTITUTION OF SUCH A POWER THE UNION OF RAILWAY WORKERS WHICH REFUSES TO TRANSPORT COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS TO PETROGRAD AT THE SAME TIME FORBIDS THE EXECUTION OF ANY ORDER WHATEVER WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE VIKZHEL THE VIKZHEL ALSO TAKES INTO ITS HANDS THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION OF THE RAILROADS OF RUSSIA AT THE END HE COULD HARDLY BE HEARD FOR THE FURIOUS STORM OF ABUSE WHICH BEAT UPON HIM
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE BOLSHEVIKI WON A MAJORITY IN THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND THE SOVIETS OF MOSCOW KIEV ODESSA AND OTHER CITIES FOLLOWED SUIT
4 BELGIUM TO BE RESTORED
THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 30TH
BUT THERE'LL PROBABLY BE SHOOTING WE CLIMBED IN
AN ENERGETIC PEACE PROGRAMME BUT NOT AN ULTIMATUM TO THE WORLD SUCH AS THE BOLSHEVIKI ISSUED
A PILE OF LUMBER BARRED THE END OF THE MOIKA QUAY
THE TELEPHONE GIRLS WERE TESTIFYING
VOLIA NARODA PUBLISHED A PRIKAZ LAUNCHED BY HIM AT PSKOV
ON THE 20TH OF NOVEMBER THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ISSUED A WARNING
THERE ARE SOME CADETS WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE
THE TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT CLOSING OF ANY ORGAN OF THE PRESS SHALL BE CARRIED OUT ONLY BY VIRTUE OF A RESOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
INSTANTLY THE BOLSHEVIKI BEGAN TO CRY OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS ABANDONING THE RED CAPITAL IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE REVOLUTION
MONDAY THE 12TH WAS A DAY OF SUSPENSE
ON THE 22D OF NOVEMBER THE WALLS OF THE CITY WERE PLACARDED WITH A SHEET HEADED EXTRAORDINARY COMMUNICATION
THE SOLDIERS ARGUED FEEBLY WITH EMBARRASSED GRINS
DOWN IN FRONT OF THE SOVIET PALACE AN AUTO-TRUCK WAS GOING TO THE FRONT
PROVOCATORI I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY
GET IT PRINTED--GET IT PRINTED QUICK AND AROUND TO THE BARRACKS BY THE ORDER OF THE SUPREME COMMANDER I AM APPOINTED COMMANDANT OF THE TROOPS CONCENTRATED UNDER PETROGRAD
PROPAGANDA WAS MAKING HEADWAY
SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST THEY POURED THROUGH THE SHABBY STREETS TOWARD THE MOSKOVSKY GATE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITH RIFLES PICKS SPADES ROLLS OF WIRE CARTRIDGE-BELTS OVER THEIR WORKING CLOTHES
LET THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE REJECT THE IRRESPONSIBLE ATTEMPTS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI TO CREATE A REVOLT IN THE REAR ABOUT 9 A
THE RAGGED ARMIES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ARE NOT FORGOTTEN--VALMY AND THE LINES OF WEISSEMBOURG
AT THIS MOMENT WHEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS THE QUESTION OF POWER IS BEING SETTLED BY MEANS OF A MILITARY PLOT ORGANISED BY ONE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES FOR A MOMENT HE COULD NOT MAKE HIMSELF HEARD ABOVE THE NOISE ALL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES MUST FACE THE FACT
IT DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE ANYTHING BUT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKI AT THE HEAD OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SEIZED THE STATE POWER OF RUSSIA AND PLACED IT IN THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS
LATER AT A MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET TROTZKY ANSWERED A QUESTION ABOUT THE FORMATION OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
BEFORE MIDNIGHT OF MONDAY THE COSSACKS BROKE AND WERE FLEEING LEAVING THEIR ARTILLERY BEHIND THEM AND THE ARMY OF THE PROLETARIAT ON A LONG RAGGED FRONT MOVED FORWARD AND ROLLED INTO TSARSKOYE BEFORE THE ENEMY HAD A CHANCE TO DESTROY THE GREAT GOVERNMENT WIRELESS STATION FROM WHICH NOW THE COMMISSARS OF SMOLNY WERE HURLING OUT TO THE WORLD PAEANS OF TRIUMPH
RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE ACTION OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS PASSED BY OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
I TOO SAID BAKLANOV SUDDENLY
THE OBORONTSI IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ARE PLAYING KORNILOV'S GAME
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES DECLARES THAT IT CONSIDERS NOW AS WELL AS BEFORE THAT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE PROVINCES AT THIS MOMENT THE FORCES NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WHICH IS THE ONLY SALVATION OF THE WORKING-CLASS AND THE COUNTRY
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ACCEPTED
NOW DURING THE REVOLUTION ONE SEES REVOLTS OF PEASANTS WHO ARE TIRED OF WAITING FOR THEIR PROMISED LAND
REESTABLISHMENT FOR THIS PURPOSE OF THE COURTS OF HONOR
THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC UNTIL THE RESUMPTION OF ITS LABOURS INVITES THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC TO GROUP THEMSELVES AROUND THE....LOCAL COMMITTEES FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION WHICH ARE ORGANISING THE OVERTHROW OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE CREATION OF A GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF LEADING THE COUNTRY TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE MAJORITY OF THE INTELLECTUALS DID NOT PARTICIPATE AND MANY WORKERS ALSO
THE COMMON SOLDIERS AND THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS SUPPORTED THE SOVIETS BY A VAST MAJORITY
A UKRAINEAN OFFICER SPEAKING IN HIS NATIVE TONGUE
FOR THEY WILL BRING NOTHING BUT DISASTER UPON RUSSIA
IT WOULD BE CHILDISH TO THINK WE CAN WIN BY ANY OTHER MEANS
ON THE SADOVAYA ONE AFTERNOON I SAW A CROWD OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE BEAT AND TRAMPLE TO DEATH A SOLDIER CAUGHT STEALING
FOR THE FRONT DELEGATES ANNOUNCING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DECIDED TO LEAVE THE CONGRESS BY A SMALL MAJORITY AND THAT THE BOLSHEVIK MEMBERS HAD NOT EVEN TAKEN PART IN THE VOTE AS THEY STOOD FOR DIVISION ACCORDING TO POLITICAL PARTIES AND NOT GROUPS
ON THE RUSSIAN FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED
3 ACROSS THE HALL CAME A MAN IN A RAGGED SOLDIER-COAT AND SHAPKA WHOSE FACE WAS FAMILIAR
PEACE I WENT ACROSS THE RIVER TO THE CIRQUE MODERNE TO ONE OF THE GREAT POPULAR MEETINGS WHICH OCCURRED ALL OVER THE CITY MORE NUMEROUS NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
11 ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS PIECES OF POLITICAL PROPAGANDA THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN
GZHELSHAKH
RED WITH GREAT LETTERS IN GOLD AND IN WHITE SAYING MARTYRS OF THE BEGINNING OF WORLD SOCIAL REVOLUTION AND LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF WORKERS OF THE WORLD A BITTER WIND SWEPT THE SQUARE LIFTING THE BANNERS
WE MUST HAVE IMMEDIATE ACTION
THERE ARE ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES
WE RIDICULE THESE COALITIONS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES WHOSE MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS ARE PETTY JOURNALISTS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION
IF TO CONSTITUTE THE NEW MINISTRY IT IS NECESSARY TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WE AGREE TO ADMIT THEM IN A MINORITY TO THE CABINET PRAVDA IRONICALLY CALLING ATTENTION TO KERENSKY'S HUMANITARIAN SENTIMENTS PUBLISHED HIS DESPATCH TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
SEE PAGE 273
HOWEVER THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES REMAINED IN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT SHARING THE CABINET PORTFOLIOS ESPECIALLY THAT OF AGRICULTURE
ACTS OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS IN THIS BOOK I AM GIVING ONLY SUCH DECREES AS ARE IN MY OPINION PERTINENT TO THE BOLSHEVIK CONQUEST OF POWER
THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS ARE BEING EMANCIPATED FROM THE POWER OF AUTOCRATIC GENERALS FOR GENERALS WILL HENCEFORTH BE ELECTIVE AND SUBJECT TO RECALL
BY ANNEXATION OR CONQUEST OF FOREIGN TERRITORY THE GOVERNMENT MEANS--CONFORMABLY TO THE CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS IN GENERAL AND THE RIGHTS OF THE WORKING-CLASS IN PARTICULAR--ALL UNION TO A GREAT AND STRONG STATE OF A SMALL OR WEAK NATIONALITY WITHOUT THE VOLUNTARY CLEAR AND PRECISE EXPRESSION OF ITS CONSENT AND DESIRE
GREAT HOLES WERE TORN IN THE WALLS OF THE SCHOOL
THE SPLENDID EXAMPLES OF THE CHARTIST MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND THE SERIES OF REVOLUTIONS OF WORLD-WIDE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE FRENCH PROLETARIAT--AND FINALLY IN GERMANY THE HISTORIC STRUGGLE AGAINST THE LAWS OF EXCEPTION AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WORKERS OF THE WHOLE WORLD OF PROLONGED AND STUBBORN ACTION AND THE CREATION OF THE FORMIDABLE ORGANISATIONS OF GERMAN PROLETARIANS--ALL THESE MODELS OF PROLETARIAN HEROISM THESE MONUMENTS OF HISTORY ARE FOR US A SURE GUARANTEE THAT THE WORKERS OF THESE COUNTRIES WILL UNDERSTAND THE DUTY IMPOSED UPON THEM TO LIBERATE HUMANITY FROM THE HORRORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WAR
THEIR PLAN WAS DISCOVERED IN TIME BY SUB-LIEUTENANT BLAGONRAVOV THANKS TO THE REVOLUTIONARY VIGILANCE OF A SOLDIER OF THE RED GUARD WHOSE NAME SHALL BE MADE PUBLIC
I WILL NOT SAY TO YOU THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
THESE WERE FORMED IN THE SUMMER OF 1917 BY KERENSKY FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING THE DISCIPLINE AND COMBATIVE FIRE OF THE ARMY BY HEROIC EXAMPLE
THE SPHERE OF OUR WORK IS INCREASING AND WE MUST BE GIVEN FULL LIBERTY OF ACTION AND OUR RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED BY BOTH PARTIES
CERTIFICATE APPROVING TELEGRAM TRANSMISSION ORDER GIVEN ME AT STAFF HEADQUARTERS BY COMMAND OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS TO TRANSMIT THE FIRST DESPATCH OUT OF PEROGRAD AFTER THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION OVER THE GOVERNMENT WIRES TO AMERICA
BUT I HAVE PERSONALLY MET OFFICERS ON THE NORTHERN FRONT WHO FRANKLY PREFERRED MILITARY DISASTER TO COOPERATION WITH THE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES
WE MUST HAVE IMMEDIATELY STRONG DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY
IN THIS BOOK THE FIRST OF SEVERAL WHICH I AM WRITING I MUST CONFINE MYSELF TO A CHRONICLE OF THOSE EVENTS WHICH I MYSELF OBSERVED AND EXPERIENCED AND THOSE SUPPORTED BY RELIABLE EVIDENCE

CHAPTER VII THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT SATURDAY NOVEMBER 10TH
WE WILL PASS
ALL THE LONG DAY THE FUNERAL PROCESSION PASSED COMING IN BY THE IBERIAN GATE AND LEAVING THE SQUARE BY WAY OF THE NIKOLSKAYA A RIVER OF RED BANNERS BEARING WORDS OF HOPE AND BROTHERHOOD AND STUPENDOUS PROPHECIES AGAINST A BACK-GROUND OF FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE,--UNDER THE EYES OF THE WORLD'S WORKERS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS FOREVER
| 500 | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | MEN'S | SUIT | 40
THEY LAUGHED GOOD-NATUREDLY AND PRESSED OUT OF LINE TO SLAP THE RED GUARDS ON THE BACK WITH HALF-JOKING HALF-ADMIRING REMARKS
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE MORE OR LESS IMPROPER BUT THE NATIONS MUST REALISE THE DANGER OF BOLSHEVISM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES--SUCH CONTAGIOUS IDEAS AS PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP AND WORLD SOCIAL REVOLUTION
ALL WHO CONSENTED TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE PAID FULL WAGES AND IN SOME CASES THEIR PAY WAS INCREASED
LET ALL KNOW THAT EVERY MAN WHO IN THESE TERRIBLE DAYS CALLS ON YOU TO COME OUT IN THE STREETS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IS EITHER A SECRET SERVANT OF THE TSAR A PROVOCATOR OR AN UNWISE ASSISTANT OF THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE OR A PAID SPY OF WILHELM
THEY ONLY WAG THEIR TAILS HOW THE CROWD ROSE TO THEM RECOGNISING BROTHERS
RABOTCHI PUT BLOSSOMED OUT AS PRAVDA LENIN'S NEWSPAPER WHICH HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED IN JULY
IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US SO THE MEETING ROARED ON LEADER AFTER LEADER EXPLAINING EXHORTING ARGUING SOLDIER AFTER SOLDIER WORKMAN AFTER WORKMAN STANDING UP TO SPEAK HIS MIND AND HIS HEART
USSPENSKY CATHEDRAL HAD A SHELL-HOLE IN ONE OF THE CUPOLAS BUT EXCEPT FOR A FEW FEET OF MOSAIC IN THE CEILING WAS UNDAMAGED
IN THE MILITARY SCHOOLS ARE RETAINED ONLY THE ARMS NECESSARY FOR INSTRUCTION
IF THAT IS SO WE BOW TO THEM
THE DECISIVE STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN
YOU SEE MOST OF THE SOLDIERS IN THE GARRISON ARE BOLSHEVIKI AND TO-DAY AFTER THE BATTLE THEY ALL WENT AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF PETROGRAD TAKING THE ARTILLERY WITH THEM
2 IN THE FACTORIES WERE FIGHTING BLACK-LISTS AND LOCKOUTS
KALEDIN IS MARCHING FROM THE DON
ZINOVIEV WAS DEPOSED AS PRESIDENT OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
THERE IN THE GREAT MEETING-HALL THE DELEGATES GATHERED ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
ONE DELEGATE DARED TO RAISE HIS HAND AGAINST BUT THE SUDDEN SHARP OUTBURST AROUND HIM BROUGHT IT SWIFTLY DOWN
1860 CERTIFICATE IS GIVEN BY THE PRESENT TO THE JOURNALIST OF THE NEW YORK SOCIALIST PRESS JOHN REED THAT THE TEXT OF THE TELEGRAM HEREWITH HAS BEEN EXAMINED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS AND THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO ITS TRANSMISSION AND ALSO IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALL COOPERATE IN EVERY WAY TO TRANSMIT SAME TO ITS DESTINATION
VLADIMIR KYRILOVITCH WHERE IS YOUR COMPANY CAPTAIN KHERLOV POINTED
THE COLONEL AGAIN TURNED TO THE MAP
B FOR THE PAYMENT OF SALARIES OF EMPLOYEES AND THE EARNINGS OF WORKERS ACCORDING TO THE TABLES AND LISTS CERTIFIED BY THE FACTORY COMMITTEES OR SOVIETS OF EMPLOYEES AND ATTESTED BY THE SIGNATURES OF THE COMMISSARS OR THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND THE DISTRICT MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES
THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET FEARED THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENTIONS AND FROM THE FRONT CAME HUNDREDS OF DELEGATES CHOSEN BY THE COMMON SOLDIERS CRYING IT IS TRUE WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANT WE MUST KNOW THAT PETROGRAD AND THE REVOLUTION ARE WELL-GUARDED
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII 1
ALL THE COUNTRY FROM NOW ON WILL BE CONVINCED THAT THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS IS NO EPHEMERAL THING BUT AN INVINCIBLE FACT
THAT IS ALL
BUT BENEATH ALL THE BREEZY ASSURANCE THERE WAS A CHILL PREMONITION A FEELING OF UNEASINESS IN THE AIR
IT TAKES A GOOD DEAL OF COURAGE TO DRIVE A SLEIGH NOWADAYS HE WENT ON
WE WENT INTO THE HOTEL FRANCE FOR DINNER AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOUP THE WAITER VERY PALE IN THE FACE CAME UP AND INSISTED THAT WE MOVE TO THE MAIN DINING-ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO PUT OUT THE LIGHTS IN THE CAFE
PRESIDENT OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH SVERDLOV
HE FLATLY REFUSED TO RESIGN AND SURROUNDED BY THREE IMMENSE COSSACK ARMIES LAY AT NOVOTCHERKASK PLOTTING AND MENACING
CITIZENS SOLDIERS VALOROUS COSSACKS OF THE GARRISON OF PETROGRAD
IMAGINE
PREAMBLE--DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION OF THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS BEGAN UNDER THE COMMON BANNER OF EMANCIPATION
EVERY TROOP-TRAIN THAT LEFT PETROGRAD WAS TAKEN OUT BY FORCE AND RAILWAY OFFICIALS HAD TO BE ARRESTED EACH TIME--WHEREUPON THE VIKZHEL THREATENED AN IMMEDIATE GENERAL STRIKE UNLESS THEY WERE RELEASED
AS FOR THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IT HAS SHOWN ITSELF INCAPABLE OF HOLDING THE POWER
YOU REPRESENT THE OFFICERS NOT THE SOLDIERS
THE AIR WAS THICK WITH CIGARETTE SMOKE AND HUMAN BREATHING AND THE SMELL OF COARSE CLOTHES AND SWEAT
CAPTAIN GOMBERG WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS
GO HOME NOW AND LEAVE US IN PEACE AT THIS THERE WAS A GREAT CLAMOUR OF ANGER AND RESENTMENT PROKOPOVITCH HAD MOUNTED SOME SORT OF BOX AND WAVING HIS UMBRELLA HE MADE A SPEECH
GRAPHIC PAGE 276
PAY NO ATTENTION TO THEM
TO THESE 150 DELEGATES OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES SHALL BE ADDED 75 DELEGATES OF THE PROVINCIAL SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES 80 FROM THE FRONT ORGANISATIONS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY 40 FROM THE TRADE UNIONS 25 FROM THE VARIOUS ALL-RUSSIAN UNIONS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR IMPORTANCE 10 FROM THE VIKZHEL AND 5 FROM THE POST AND TELEGRAPH WORKERS AND 50 DELEGATES FROM THE SOCIALIST GROUPS IN THE PETROGRAD CITY DUMA
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DECLARES THAT IT WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY VIOLATION OF REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
THE SAME NIGHT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS TELEGRAPHED TO GENERAL DUKHONIN
THE THIRD OWNED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN A CHOCOLATE FACTORY WHICH SUPPLIED THE LOCAL COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES--ON CONDITION THAT THE COOPERATIVES FURNISHED HIM EVERYTHING HE NEEDED
WE INVITE THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO FORM OUT OF THESE VIOLATORS OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL THESE ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION LABOUR DETACHMENTS TO WORK IN THE REAR ON THE FRONT IN THE TRENCHES UNDER ENEMY FIRE 7
AND THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES ARE A WONDERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THEIR ORGANISING GENIUS
RED GUARDS ARE INCAPABLE OF HANDLING A COMPLICATED BUSINESS LIKE THE RAILWAYS
OUR ENEMY LOOKS UPON RUSSIA AS A MARKET FOR ITS PRODUCTS
WITH HIS OWN HANDS TROTZKY IS CONDUCTING AN ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY 6
1 DO YOU KNOW THAT IN YOUR NAME ALL OFFICERS WHO COULD TAKE PART IN THE FIGHT ARE BEING INVITED TO LEAVE PETROGRAD ON THE PRETEXT OF JOINING YOU
THE MINISTRY THE PRESENT WORK MUST IN THE INTERIM PROCEED THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION
THE PROPOSAL TO EXCLUDE LENIN AND TROTZKY IS A PROPOSAL TO DECAPITATE OUR PARTY AND WE DO NOT ACCEPT IT
SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN SEEN EVEN IN THIS REVOLUTION
THE KORNILOVTSI ARE MOBILISING THEIR FORCES IN ORDER TO CRUSH THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND BREAK THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
FOR THIS GOVERNMENT WILL ADDRESS ITSELF DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY TO ALL PEOPLES OVER THE HEADS OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS PROPOSING AN ARMISTICE
IT IS WITH THIS IN VIEW THAT I HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK
SHALIAPIN WAS SINGING
ONE MAN WENT STRUTTING AROUND WITH A BRONZE CLOCK PERCHED ON HIS SHOULDER
HOW CAN I PERSUADE YOU IF YOU HAVE MADE UP YOUR MINDS
AT THE SAME TIME FLOODS OF RESOLUTIONS FROM WORKERS ORGANISATIONS FROM MILITARY UNITS EVEN FROM THE PEASANTS IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY POURED IN UPON THE DUMA CALLING IT COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY KORNILOVITZ AND DEMANDING THAT IT RESIGN
THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THE PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING
HOW MANY OF YOU DID THEY KILL I ASKED
UNION OF UNIONS DURING THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 PROFESSOR MILIUKOV AND OTHER LIBERALS ESTABLISHED UNIONS OF PROFESSIONAL MEN--DOCTORS LAWYERS PHYSICIANS ETC
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE REPORTS HE SAID SLOWLY
THE ARMY BY AN ENORMOUS MAJORITY HAS PRONOUNCED IN FAVOUR OF THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IT HAS CREATED
OBLIGATORY ORDINANCE 1
THE BOLSHEVIKI SAID TRUPP WILL BE CONQUERED BY MORAL FORCE AND NOT BY BAYONETS MEANWHILE ALL WAS NOT WELL ON THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT
THE MORALE OF THE TROOPS IS BEYOND ALL PRAISE
THE MOST IMPORTANT CENTRAL COMMITTEES MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK ARE
SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL N
SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL N
SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL N
SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL N
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS APPOINTED A COMMISSAR FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUNKENNESS WHO BESIDES MERCILESSLY PUTTING DOWN THE WINE RIOTS DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BOTTLES OF LIQUOR
BASED UPON THE WILL OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS BASED UPON THE TRIUMPHANT UPRISING OF THE PETROGRAD WORKMEN AND SOLDIERS THE CONGRESS ASSUMES THE POWER
YOUR DAMN KERENSKY DIRTY BOURGEOIS
THE LEGISLATIVE SECTION ATTACHED TO THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ISSUES PERIODICALLY A COLLECTION OF REGULATIONS AND ORDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH POSSESS THE FORCE OF LAW
THEY STOLE OUR LAND PROGRAMME IN ORDER TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE PEASANTS
IT IS BETTER NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
FUEL AND OTHER PRIMARY NECESSITIES ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCURE
A VIOLENT YOUNG SOLDIER REPLIED
THE ONLY TALK IN GERMANY IS OF PEACE
BUT STILL NO SIGN FROM THE BOLSHEVIKI
VICTORY
WE WILL DEFEND THE CITY ALSO BUT WE WON'T SUPPORT THE BOLSHEVIKI
YOU FELL IN THE FATAL FIGHT FOR THE LIBERTY OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE HONOUR OF THE PEOPLE
COMRADE SOLIDERS BEGAN KRYLENKO IN A VOICE HUSKY WITH FATIGUE
A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC WAS TALKING AS WE CAME IN
A DELEGATE FROM THE RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE MACEDONIAN FRONT SPOKE BITTERLY OF THEIR SITUATION
ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY NOBLES MERCHANTS PETTY BOURGEOIS ETC AND ALL TITLES PRINCE COUNT AND OTHERS AND ALL DENOMINATIONS OF CIVIL RANK PRIVY STATE COUNCILLOR AND OTHERS ARE ABOLISHED AND THERE IS ESTABLISHED THE GENERAL DENOMINATION OF CITIZEN OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
ALL THE PRIVATE BANKS WERE CLOSED
IF THERE ARE COMRADES HERE WHO HAVEN'T THE COURAGE AND THE WILL TO DARE WHAT WE DARE LET THEM LEAVE WITH THE REST OF THE COWARDS AND CONCILIATORS
NEVERTHELESS TCHERNOV REMAINED VERY POPULAR
THE RIGHT OF MOST FAVOURED NATION MUST BE GIVEN TO ALL COUNTRIES WITHOUT DISTINCTION
WE WALKED IN THERE HE SAID AND FILLED ALL THE DOORS WITH COMRADES
THE SOUND OF IT WILL RING WITH RESOUNDING ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE WORLD--IN PARIS IN LONDON AND ACROSS THE OCEAN--IN NEW YORK
I REMARKED THAT AS THE THRONG PASSED THE IBERIAN CHAPEL WHERE ALWAYS BEFORE THE PASSERBY HAD CROSSED HIMSELF THEY DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE IT
WHY DID PUBLIC OPINION CHANGE TOWARD KERENSKY
WILL A COALITION WITH THE OBORONTSI FURNISH MORE
THE PROBLEM OF THE DAY IS NOT ONLY TO RENDER HARMLESS IRRESPONSIBLE DEMAGOGUES BUT TO FIGHT AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION
IMAGINE THE SLEEPLESS KRYLENKOS WATCHING THE REGIMENTS HURRYING FROM PLACE TO PLACE ARGUING THREATENING ENTREATING
PROTEST OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA THE CENTRAL CITY DUMA ELECTED ON THE MOST DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES HAS UNDERTAKEN THE BURDEN OF MANAGING MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS AND FOOD SUPPLIES AT THE TIME OF THE GREATEST DISORGANISATION
TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT ORGANISE THE CITY KEEP THE GARRISON LOYAL FIGHT THE DUMA AND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION KEEP OUT THE GERMANS PREPARE TO DO BATTLE WITH KERENSKY INFORM THE PROVINCES WHAT HAD HAPPENED PROPAGANDISE FROM ARCHANGEL TO VLADIVOSTOK
WE WANT KHANJUNOV
THE INSANE ATTEMPT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IS ON THE EVE OF COLLAPSE
TOWARD EVENING HE WAS IN OSTROV PROVINCE OF PSKOV
I SECT
I SECT
I SECT

WHILE WE ARE HERE DISCUSSING PROPOSITIONS OF PEACE THERE IS A BATTLE ON IN THE STREETS
WITH THE INSURRECTION OF NOVEMBER 7TH THE WORKING MASSES HAVE WON FOR THE FIRST TIME THE REAL POWER
IN THE NEAR DISTANCE RIDERLESS COSSACK HORSES CIRCLED HUNGRILY FOR THE GRASS OF THE PLAIN HAD DIED LONG AGO
ALL ADDRESSING BY TITLES IS ABOLISHED
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THIS INTERVENTION MAY NOT BE NECESSARY
THE TSAY-EE-KAH APPEALS TO THE TROOPS WHICH MARCH UNDER THE FLAG OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION AND INVITES THEM IMMEDIATELY TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS--TO SHED NO LONGER THE BLOOD OF THEIR BROTHERS IN THE INTERESTS OF A HANDFUL OF LAND-OWNERS AND CAPITALISTS
THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION HASN'T FAILED AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY HASN'T FAILED
OUT ON THE ROAD AGAIN THE TWO SOLDIERS HELD ANOTHER CONSULTATION
OUR DUTY TO THE RUSSIAN PROLETARIAT DOESN'T PERMIT US TO REMAIN HERE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CRIMES
ABUSES OF ALL SORTS ACTS OF VANDALISM AND PILLAGE THE BOMBARDMENT OF THE WINTER PALACE ARBITRARY ARRESTS--ALL THESE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE AROUSED AGAINST THEM THE RESENTMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE SAILORS AND SOLDIERS
BUT THE BOURGEOISIE DID NOT NEED THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS
ONLY TWO CLASSES WENT ON THE SOLDIER DOGGEDLY
INSTEAD OF BEING A DESTRUCTIVE FORCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE THE ONLY PARTY IN RUSSIA WITH A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM AND THE POWER TO IMPOSE IT ON THE COUNTRY
EDUCATION IS A CREATIVE PROCESS
THE LAST DAYS OF THE DUMA WERE STORMY WITH THE BITTER DEMANDS OF THE MUNICIPAL WORKERS FOR DECENT LIVING WAGES AND THE THREAT OF STRIKES
AVILOV GLIEBOV CHAIRMAN FOR NATIONALITIES I
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS ABOLISHED THE DEATH PENALTY CANNOT PERMIT SUCH DEEDS
A THOSE INCITING TO OPEN RESISTANCE OR DISOBEDIENCE TO THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT
MOGHILEV HAD DECLARED AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI
LONG LIVE REVOLUTIONARY POPULAR SOCIALIST RUSSIA
ON THE PLATFORM SAT THE LEADERS OF THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH_--FOR THE LAST TIME DOMINATING THE TURBULENT SOVIETS WHICH THEY HAD RULED FROM THE FIRST DAYS AND WHICH WERE NOW RISEN AGAINST THEM
THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE THE MOSCOW CONFERENCE THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
THE PRESENT DECREE BECOMES EFFECTIVE ON THE DAY IT IS PUBLISHED AND APPLIED BY THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
WE ARE DYING FOR NO REASON
THE WOODEN CHEST WAS EMPTY
SIGNED THE IMPERIAL MANIFEST ORDERING THE DISSOLUTION OF THE FINNISH DIET
WHILE WE HAVING DOZENS OF NEWSPAPERS FREEDOM OF MEETING THE MAJORITY OF THE SOVIETS WE THE BEST-PLACED INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIANS OF THE ENTIRE WORLD CAN WE REFUSE TO SUPPORT THE GERMAN REVOLUTIONISTS AND INSURRECTIONARY ORGANISATIONS
I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO GO AWAY FROM RUSSIA
YOU MIGHT CALL HIM OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER ARMS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO US REVOLVERS AND RIFLES--"WE MIGHT MEET SOME COSSACKS YOU KNOW"--AND WE ALL PILED INTO THE AMBULANCE TOGETHER WITH THREE GREAT BUNDLES OF NEWSPAPERS FOR THE FRONT
THE OFFICERS AND ESPECIALLY THE MENSHEVIKI AND THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ARE TRYING DELIBERATELY TO CRIPPLE THE BOLSHEVIKI
IN THE MORNING THERE WILL BE A MEETING OF ALL FACTIONS TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION
IF YOU WON'T ARREST HIM THEN WE WILL AND WE'LL TAKE HIM TO PETROGRAD AND PUT HIM IN PETER-PAUL WHERE HE BELONGS AT THIS THE OTHER RED GUARDS GROWLED ASSENT
THE PROFESSOR WAS PUZZLED BUT HE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN
THE SOVIET ARTILLERY WAS STATIONED IN SKOBELIEV SQUARE BOMBARDING THE CITY DUMA BUILDING THE PREFECTURE AND THE HOTEL METROPOLE
THERE MUST BE NO MORE KORNILOVS
A DETACHMENT OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS FROM SMOLNY OCCUPIED THE TELEGRAPH AGENCY
ALL THE COSTS OF INSURANCE TO BE CHARGED TO EMPLOYERS
JUST TO READ IT COMRADE HESITATINGLY SHE TOOK THE PAPER AND READ ALOUD SWIFTLY
LEAFLET POPULAR LEAFLET SOLD IN THE STREETS JUST AFTER THE BOLSHEVIK INSURRECTION CONTAINING RHYMES AND JOKES ABOUT THE DEFEATED BOURGEOISIE AND THE MODERATE SOCIALIST LEADERS CALLED HOW THE BOORZHUI BOURGEOISIE LOST THE POWER DELEGATIONS FROM THE CONFERENCE WERE SENT TO THE FRONT TO GATCHINA
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE OUR REPORT OF CONDITIONS IN TSARSKOYE
THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY ABOUT A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND STUDENTS WHO ATTACKED THEM WITH PASSIONATE ARGUMENT AND EPITHET
OUR ULTIMATE VICTORY IS CERTAIN
SEE SAID LENIN
DAN TELLS YOU THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE AN INSURRECTION
TRADE UNIONS ALTHOUGH MOSTLY INDUSTRIAL IN FORM THE RUSSIAN LABOUR UNIONS WERE STILL CALLED TRADE UNIONS AND AT THE TIME OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION HAD FROM THREE TO FOUR MILLION MEMBERS
THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEE FORMS A COMMISSION TO CONTROL THE SUPPLYING OF THE FACTORY WITH RAW MATERIALS FUEL ORDERS LABOUR POWER AND TECHNICAL STAFF INCLUDING EQUIPMENT AND ALL OTHER SUPPLIES AND ARRANGEMENTS AND ALSO TO ASSURE THE FACTORY'S ADHERENCE TO THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PLAN
THEREFORE THE REALISATION OF WORKERS CONTROL IS AN INDISPENSABLE PRELIMINARY TO THE DEMOBILISATION OF INDUSTRY
WE ARE CLOSELY UNITED WITH OUR ALLIES
BUT ONLY THE RICH COULD BUY THEM
FOR EXAMPLE THE CONFISCATION OF THE LANDED ESTATES WILL PROVOKE THE RESISTANCE NOT ONLY OF RUSSIAN LAND-OWNERS BUT ALSO OF FOREIGN CAPITAL--WITH WHOM THE GREAT LANDED PROPERTIES ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF THE BANKS
AROUND IN FRONT STOOD A LITTLE GREY-MOUSTACHED MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A GENERAL THE CENTRE OF A KNOT OF SOLDIERS
THE ARMY IS IMPERFECTLY REPRESENTED IN THIS CONGRESS AND FURTHERMORE THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CONSTITUENT SHOUTS AND STAMPING ALWAYS GROWING MORE VIOLENT
WERE THEY TO BOTHER ABOUT THE COMFORT OF A LOT OF BOORZHUI BOURGEOIS
DISARMED THE WORKMEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GENERAL POLOVTSEV CHECKMATED THE REVOLUTIONARY SOLDIERS AND APPROVED OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE ARMY
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT RELYING UPON THE SUPPORT OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES ANNOUNCES TO THE WORKING-CLASS OF RUSSIA AND TO THE TOWN AND VILLAGE POOR THAT IT WILL IMMEDIATELY PREPARE LAWS ON SOCIAL INSURANCE BASED ON THE FORMULAS PROPOSED BY THE LABOUR ORGANISATIONS
OUTRAGE
HE WAS TOLD BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE EXTREME LEFT THAT REVOLUTION IN GERMANY WAS IMPOSSIBLE DURING THE WAR HERE INTERRUPTIONS BEGAN TO COME THICK AND FAST BUT AVILOV KEPT ON
KAMENIEV WAS STRIPPED OF HIS POWERS AS PRESIDENT OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND SVERDLOV ELECTED IN HIS PLACE
IN THIS WAY WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO AVOID BLOOD-SHED WE HURRIED FROM THE PLACE STOPPING FOR A MOMENT AT THE ROOM WHERE THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WORKED AT FURIOUS SPEED ENGULFING AND SPITTING OUT PANTING COURIERS DESPATCHING COMMISSARS ARMED WITH POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH TO ALL THE CORNERS OF THE CITY AMID THE BUZZ OF THE TELEPHONOGRAPHS
ALL WORKERS MOVEMENTS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN DEFEATED
ALL ORDERS GIVEN BY THE VOLOST LAND COMMITTEES ADOPTED WITH THE ASSENT OF THE DISTRICT SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES IN FULFILMENT OF THE DECREES ISSUED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY POWER ARE ABSOLUTELY LEGAL AND ARE TO BE FORTHWITH AND IRREFUTABLY BROUGHT INTO EXECUTION
NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE INTELLECTUALS NOR ANY OTHER POWER OUTSIDE OF THEMSELVES CAN GIVE IT TO THEM
AN HONEST PEACE BETWEEN PEOPLES
THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEE HE DECLARED HAD DISCOVERED HUGE HIDDEN SUPPLIES
FROM THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES PEASANT COMMUNES REGIMENTS AND ARMIES SHIPS ON THE WIDE SEA GREETINGS POURED INTO PETROGRAD--GREETINGS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE
KHANJUNOV RETURNED PERSUASIVE AND SYMPATHETIC
I HAVE JUST BEEN COMPELLED TO WAKE THEM UP--THEY WERE SURE WE WERE GOING TO MASSACRE THEM
THE CADETS DECLARED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO LEGAL RIGHT TO DECLARE RUSSIA A REPUBLIC
THESE CENTRAL COMMITTEES HAD ALL BEEN ELECTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER OR EVEN BEFORE WHEN THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAD AN ENORMOUS FOLLOWING
THE WAY IN WHICH LAND IS TO BE USED MAY BE INDIVIDUALLY DETERMINED UPON
NEVER MIND HE SAID WHEN THE TIME COMES WE'LL SEE THAT YOU GET YOUR SEATS 9 SEE NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
STATUETTES BOTTLES OF INK BED-SPREADS WORKED WITH THE IMPERIAL MONOGRAM CANDLES A SMALL OIL-PAINTING DESK BLOTTERS GOLD-HANDLED SWORDS CAKES OF SOAP CLOTHES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION BLANKETS
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAS ORDERED ITS TROOPS TO RETREAT
EVENTS OF THE 13TH IN PETROGRAD THREE REGIMENTS OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISON TO TAKE ANY PART IN THE BATTLE AGAINST KERENSKY
THE MINISTRIES OF LABOUR INTERIOR AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS MUST BE GIVEN TO THE BOLSHEVIKI
IN TAMBOV GOVERNMENT THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AGRARIAN UPRISING WITH WONDERFUL POLITICAL RESULTS
FIRST YOU OFFER PEACE WITHOUT ANNEXATIONS AND INDEMNITIES AND THEN YOU SAY YOU WILL CONSIDER ALL PEACE OFFERS
WE SHALL SUPPORT THE WORKING COSSACKS IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS

A PURELY SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT WAS TAKING SHAPE--ALL ELEMENTS EXCEPT THE BOURGEOISIE
AT FIRST THEY SAID THEY WOULD COME OUT IF THEY HAD INFANTRY SUPPORT
GOOD SAID THE COLONEL
THIS IS ALL I'VE GOT TO WEAR FROM HIM I LEARNED MANY DETAILS OF THE BLOODY SIX-DAY BATTLE WHICH HAD RENT MOSCOW IN TWO
GRAPHIC PAGE 254
A WIDE-SPREAD AGITATION WAS CARRIED ON AT THE FRONT AND IN PETROGRAD EMPHASIZING THE FACT THAT FOR EIGHT MONTHS THE PETROGRAD GARRISON HAD BEEN LEADING AN EASY LIFE IN THE BARRACKS OF THE CAPITAL WHILE THEIR EXHAUSTED COMRADES IN THE TRENCHES STARVED AND DIED
WHAT WE NEED IS A MILITARY VICTORY
THE PLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY'S SAFETY LIES IN THE COOPERATION OF ALL ITS VITAL AND GENUINELY DEMOCRATIC FORCES
THEIR JUST DEMANDS OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED AT ONCE AND AT ANY COST
AND AFTER THAT THEY VOTED AGAIN--INSURRECTION WON
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE SOVIETS REPRESENT THE CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE
SO IT RESULTED IN THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS BEING OBLIGED TO GIVE WAY LITTLE BY LITTLE ON THEIR ENTIRE PROGRAM WHILE THE PROPERTIED CLASSES GREW MORE AND MORE INSISTENT
THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TO DO
IN KHARKOV THIRTY THOUSAND COAL MINERS ORGANISED ADOPTING THE PREAMBLE OF THE I
WE CANNOT READ BROTHER I TOOK HIM BY THE ARM
IN ALL QUARTERS OF THE CITY SMALL ELECTIVE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS WERE SET UP BY THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS TO DEAL WITH PETTY CRIME
AMONG THE TROOPS AT THE FRONT AGITATORS OF OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES WERE ARRESTED RADICAL NEWSPAPERS CLOSED DOWN AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT APPLIED--TO REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDISTS
AND TWO AEROPLANES LADEN WITH PROPAGANDA FLED HIGH UP TOWARD THE FRONT
IT MUST BE WELL-PLANNED AND NOT SEPARATED FROM THE INDUSTRIAL LIFE OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE

GREAT DAYS ARE COMING
RUSSIA IS BEING SOLD
WON'T YOU JOIN WITH THEM OF COURSE NOT
WE ASK YOU TO CEASE IMMEDIATELY ALL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STRIKES TO TAKE UP YOUR WORK AND DO IT IN PERFECT ORDER
BUT THE MOST FORMIDABLE MENACE TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WAS INTERNAL AND TWO-HEADED--THE KALEDIN MOVEMENT AND THE STAFF AT MOGHILEV WHERE GENERAL DUKHONIN HAD ASSUMED COMMAND
A BARRICADE HAD BEEN HEAPED UP ACROSS THE MOUTH OF NOVAYA ULITZA--BOXES BARRELS AN OLD BED-SPRING A WAGON
OUR DUTY IS TO MOBILISE ALL OUR FORCES AND MOUNT GUARD OVER THE CAUSE OF THE REVOLUTION
THE PRESENT DECREE IS OF A TEMPORARY NATURE AND WILL BE REVOKED BY A SPECIAL UKAZ WHEN NORMAL CONDITIONS OF PUBLIC LIFE ARE RE-ESTABLISHED
MORE AND MORE OPENLY THE BOURGEOIS PRESS DEFENDED HIM SPEAKING OF HIM AS THE GREAT RUSSIAN PATRIOT BURTZEV'S PAPER OBSHTCHEE DIELO COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR A DICTATORSHIP OF KORNILOV KALEDIN AND KERENSKY
THE THIRST FOR EDUCATION SO LONG THWARTED BURST WITH THE REVOLUTION INTO A FRENZY OF EXPRESSION
THE SCHOOL THE BOOK THE THEATRE THE MUSEUM ETC MAY HERE BY ONLY AIDS
ABOUT MIDNIGHT A COLONEL WITH A COMPANY OF YUNKERS ARRIVED AT THE CLUB FREE MIND WITH A WARRANT TO ARREST THE EDITOR OF RABOTCHI PUT IMMEDIATELY AN ENORMOUS MOB GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THREATENED TO LYNCH THE YUNKERS THE COLONEL THEREUPON BEGGED THAT HE AND THE YUNKERS BE ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO PETER-PAUL PRISON FOR SAFETY
PASS TO THE KREMLIN BY THIS THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITEE REQUESTS TO GIVE A PASS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING THE KREMLIN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALIST PARTY ATTACHED TO THE SOCIALIST PRESS COMRADES REED AND BRYANT
THE PEASANTS SOVIETS SHOULD BE CONSULTED
AND AS WE LOOKED ON THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION WAS FORMED--THAT COMMITTEE WHICH WAS TO DEVELOP INTO THE MOST POWERFUL ENEMY OF THE BOLSHEVIKI APPEARING IN THE NEXT WEEK SOMETIMES UNDER ITS OWN PARTISAN NAME AND SOMETIMES AS THE STRICTLY NON-PARTISAN COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY
IN A BOURGEOIS REVOLUTION LIKE THIS
TO THE LEFT TALL CHIMNEYS SOME POURING OUT BLACK SMOKE
I DON'T KNOW
THE EMIGRATION SHALL BE CARRIED OUT IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER
IN SPITE OF REVOLUTION ALL RUSSIA PLUNGING DIZZILY INTO THE UNKNOWN AND TERRIBLE FUTURE JOY SWEPT THE CITY WITH THE COMING OF THE SNOW
COME ON HE YELLED
ALL CONSCIOUS WORKERS AND SOLDIERS WHO ARE DISPLEASED WITH THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY BRING INJURY TO THEMSELVES AND TO THE REVOLUTION IF THEY INDULGE IN DEMONSTRATIONS

LONG LIVE THE UNITED DEMOCRACY THE PEASANTS POURED OUT OF THE BUILDING
IN THE MINISTRY ITSELF AT LEAST ONE-HALF THE PORTFOLIOS MUST BE RESERVED TO THE BOLSHEVIKI
IT IS ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE PROPRIETORS AND THE CAPITALISTS THE EMPLOYEES AND FUNCTIONARIES CLOSELY ALLIED WITH THE BOURGEOISIC--IN A WORD ALL THE RICH AND ALL THOSE WHO JOIN HANDS WITH THEM--REGARD THE NEW REVOLUTION WITH HOSTILITY OPPOSE ITS SUCCESS THREATEN TO HALT THE ACTIVITY OF THE BANKS AND SABOTAGE OR OBSTRUCT THE WORK OF OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS
WITH THE SANCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSAR THE MUNICIPAL DUMA CALLED IN TROOPS FROM MINSK AND BOMBARDED THE SOVIET HEADQUARTERS WITH ARTILLERY
AT THE SAME TIME IN THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE VIKZHEL DOWN ON THE SADOVAYA THE CONFERENCE OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT WAS UNDER WAY
IN THE NEW MINISTRY THE PROPERTIED CLASSES PRACTICALLY CONTROLLED AND IN THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC THEY OCCUPIED A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF SEATS
A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE DUMA HE CRIED
THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME THEIR NAMES BUT BOTH WERE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
WE IMITATED HIM PLUNGING DOWN THROUGH THE DARK STREET WITH A TAIL OF WHITE PAPERS FLOATING AND EDDYING OUT BEHIND
MANIACS HAVE RAISED A REVOLT AGAINST THE ONLY GOVERNMENTAL POWER CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
FOR THE PAST WEEK THE PETROGRAD MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AIDED BY THE RANK AND FILE OF THE RAILWAY WORKERS HAD SEIZED CONTROL OF THE NICOLAI RAILROAD AND HURLED TRAINLOAD AFTER TRAINLOAD OF SAILORS AND RED GUARDS SOUTHWEST
ON THE 31ST MAYOR SCHREIDER AND SEVERAL MEMBERS WERE ARRESTED INTERROGATED AND RELEASED
CENTRAL COMMITTEES IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF 1917 ALL-RUSSIAN CONVENTIONS OF EVERY SORT OF ORGANISATION WERE HELD AT PETROGRAD
TIKHON METROPOLITAN OF MOSCOW WAS SOON TO EXCOMMUNICATE THE SOVIETS
FOR EXAMPLE THEY HEARD ORDERS TO BRING THE GATCHINA YUNKERS TO PETROGRAD BY NIGHT AND AN ORDER FOR THE COSSACKS TO BE READY TO MARCH IN THE MORNING
YOU CONSIDER IT WON THEN HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS
EVERY DAY THESE TWO PAPERS COMMIT IN THEIR COLUMNS ACTUAL CRIMES
SUPERFICIALLY ALL WAS QUIET
THE FIRST TROUBLE AROSE WHEN THE SOLDIERS TRIED TO FORM COMMITTEES AS THEIR COMRADES IN RUSSIA WERE DOING
TOWARD THE END OF NOVEMBER OCCURRED THE WINE-POGROMS SEE APP
TELEGRAM FROM KERENSKY TO THE GENERAL IN COMMAND OF THE NORTHERN FRONT
CAPITALISM WAS WORSE AND IN ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD CAPITALISM WAS EMPEROR
NO I AM SORRY HE REPLIED IN FRENCH
A POWER WAS CREATED AROUND WHICH AND IN WHICH WE HAVE OPEN AND SECRET KORNILOVS PLAYING LEADING PARTS
STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE WORKER MASSES IN PETROGRAD NOW CAN ONLY DO HARM
KERENSKY HE SAID HAD JUST GONE TO THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC TO OFFER HIS RESIGNATION
THE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WERE ALL STOPPING WORK
2 AND DO YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T ENOUGH GASOLINE FOR HIS AUTOMOBILE
WELL WE OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED RIGHT IN ON THEM AS THEY SAT AROUND THE TABLE--TWELVE OR FIFTEEN OF THEM THREE OF US
REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE OF THE FINLAND GUARD REGIMENT APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IX 1
BUT I CONSIDER LEGITIMATE ONLY A GOVERNMENT RECOGNISED BY THE MAJORITY AND NOT ONE CREATED BY THE USURPATION OF A MINORITY WILD APPLAUSE ON ALL BENCHES EXCEPT THOSE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE ATTENTION OF DELEGATES TO THE NEW ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS IS CALLED TO ATTEMPTS OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE TO BREAK UP THE CONGRESS BY ASSERTING THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE PLACE AND THAT DELEGATES HAD BETTER LEAVE PETROGRAD
THE EYES OF ALL RUSSIA WERE FIXED ON THE GREY PLAIN BEYOND THE GATES OF PETROGRAD WHERE ALL THE AVAILABLE STRENGTH OF THE OLD ORDER FACED THE UNORGANISED POWER OF THE NEW THE UNKNOWN
AND IT IS THE BOLSHEVIKI WHO ARE TO BLAME
ALL PLACES SUSPECTED OF HAVING STORES OF LIQUOR SHOULD BE SEARCHED AND THE LIQUOR DESTROYED
I OUGHT TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE
FROM KAZAN CAME REPORTS OF A BATTLE IN THE STREETS YUNKERS AND A BRIGADE OF ARTILLERY AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIK GARRISON
OUT OF THEM SHOULDERED A LEAN YOUTH WEARING A RED ARM-BAND
THE PROPERTY OF MERCHANT AND BOURGEOIS ORGANISATIONS IS TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY TO THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENTS
IN OTHERS THEY SMASHED THE OLD OBSTRUCTIONIST COMMITTEES AND FORMED NEW ONES
ARMOURED CARS WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREET NAMED AFTER THE FIRST TSARS--OLEG RURIK SVIETOSLAV--AND DAUBED WITH HUGE RED LETTERS R
WE ALL AND I IN PARTICULAR TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING SOLDIERS FROM THE FRONT FROM GATCHINA TOLD THEIR STORIES
THE TEKHINTSI WERE NOTED FOR THEIR BLIND OBEDIENCE AND THEIR SAVAGE CRUELTY IN WARFARE
A COMMITTEE WAS TO GO AND CONFER WITH KERENSKY
IN SPITE OF THAT THE CADET PARTY WHICH UNTIL YESTERDAY WANTED THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE STATE DUMA--THIS SAME CADET PARTY SECURED THE INDEPENDENCE ASSEMBLY THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WILL NO DOUBT HAVE AS FAVOURABLE POSITION THAN THEY HAVE IN THIS COUNCIL AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
IN THE CENTRE OF THE CITY AT NIGHT PROSTITUTES IN JEWELS AND EXPENSIVE FURS WALKED UP AND DOWN CROWDED THE CAFES
I DID NOT SEE MORE THAN THREE PROLETARIANS AMONG THEM ALL
FULL LIBERTY WILL BE GIVEN IT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF RESPONSIBILITY BEFORE THE LAW IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BROADEST AND MOST PROGRESSIVE REGULATIONS
IX SECT

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THE OTHERS MASSED SLOWLY AROUND STARING AND BEGINNING TO MUTTER
IN POSTED PLACARDS YOU ARE CALLED UPON TO LYNCH US WE ARE ACCUSED FALSELY OF SABOTAGE AND STRIKES WE ARE BLAMED FOR ALL THE WOES AND MISFORTUNES THAT THE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN STRIVING INDEFATIGABLY AND UNINTERRUPTEDLY AND ARE STILL STRIVING TO SAVE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE FROM THE HORRORS OF STARVATION
BUT IT CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER STEPS AS IS CLEARLY MANIFESTED BY THE STAGES THROUGH WHICH THE REVOLUTION HAS HAD TO PASS
WE GOT INTO CONVERSATION WITH A YOUNG SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY WHO HAD WALKED OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE TO GETHER WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI THAT NIGHT WHEN TSERETELLI AND THE COMPROMISERS FORCED COALITION UPON THE DEMOCRACY OF RUSSIA
ALONE HE CLIMBED IN THE REAR SEAT AND WAS OFF-OFF TO GATCHINA TO CONQUER KERENSKY
NOTHING IS SO ASTOUNDING AS THE VITALITY OF THE SOCIAL ORGANISM--HOW IT PERSISTS FEEDING ITSELF CLOTHING ITSELF AMUSING ITSELF IN THE FACE OF THE WORST CALAMITIES
THREE DECREES SEE APP
FINALLY IT ALL TURNED INTO REBELLION
THAT IS TREASON TO RUSSIA
A FLOOD OF IMPASSIONED SPEECHES FROM MEMBERS AND EVEN FROM THE GALLERIES RESPONDED
THE KORNILOV METHOD IS THE ONLY WAY BY WHICH THE BOURGEOISIE CAN CONTROL
A GOOD-NATURED CROWD BEARING THE DISCOMFORT WITH HUMOROUS PATIENCE INTERMINABLY ARGUING ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM THE SITUATION IN PETROGRAD TO THE BRITISH TRADE-UNION SYSTEM AND DISPUTING LOUDLY WITH THE FEW BOORZHUI WHO WERE ON BOARD
TWO HOURS LATER THE DUMA GOT A TELEPHONE MESSAGE THAT THE VICTORS WERE MARCHING TOWARD THE INJINIERNY ZAMOK_--THE ENGINEERS SCHOOL
NOW OCCURRED A DRAMATIC INTERRUPTION
ABOUT NOON I WAS AGAIN IN FRONT OF SMOLNY TALKING WITH THE DRIVER OF AN AMBULANCE BOUND FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT
WHAT IF WE BOLSHEVIKI SHOULD ALSO BEGIN TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PAPERS HERE
STOP ALL TROOP-TRAINS BEING SENT BY KERENSKY AGAINST PETROGRAD
MEN IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS WERE COMING AND GOING IN AN AIMLESS WAY AND DOING A GREAT DEAL OF TALKING
RIAZANOV WAS COMING UP THE FRONT STEPS EXPLAINING IN A SORT OF HUMOROUS PANIC THAT HE COMMISSAR OF COMMERCE KNEW NOTHING WHATEVER OF BUSINESS
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY PANIC FEAR
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE TOO BATTLE WAS TAKING FORM
NOW AROSE A SOLDIER GAUNT RAGGED AND ELOQUENT TO PROTEST AGAINST THE CLAUSE OF THE NAKAZ TENDING TO DEPRIVE MILITARY DESERTERS FROM A SHARE IN VILLAGE LAND ALLOTMENTS
THE NEXT DAY A MEETING OF THE SOLDIERS SECTION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET ELECTED A COMMITTEE WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED A BOYCOTT OF THE BOURGEOIS NEWSPAPERS AND CONDEMNED THE TSAY-EE-KAH FOR OPPOSING THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
BUT WITHOUT THE ACTION OF THE EUROPEAN MASSES THESE ENDS CANNOT BE REALISED--NOW NOW WHILE EVERYBODY WAS WAITING FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI TO APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE STREETS ONE MORNING AND BEGIN TO SHOOT DOWN PEOPLE WITH WHITE COLLARS ON THE REAL INSURRECTION TOOK ITS WAY QUITE NATURALLY AND OPENLY
THOSE PHASES OF THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF THE TROOPS WHICH ARE ALREADY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEES ARE NOW FORMALLY PLACED IN THEIR DIRECT CONTROL
THE MOST HIGHLY PRIZED LOOT WAS CLOTHING WHICH THE WORKING PEOPLE NEEDED
RED GUARDS ISSUED FROM HEADQUARTERS EACH OF THEM STAGGERING UNDER AN ARM-LOAD OF SMALL CORRUGATED-IRON BOMBS FILLED WITH GRUBIT_--WHICH THEY SAY IS TEN TIMES AS STRONG AND FIVE TIMES AS SENSITIVE AS DYNAMITE
THOSE WHO FEAR THAT THE ALLIES WILL TRY TO PROFIT BY OUR DIFFICULT SITUATION TO MAKE US SUPPORT MORE THAN OUR SHARE OF THE BURDEN OF WAR AND TO SOLVE THE QUESTIONS OF PEACE AT OUR EXPENSE ARE ENTIRELY MISTAKEN
AT THE END USTINOV ANNOUNCED THE ARRIVAL RIVAL OF A DELEGATION FROM SMOLNY ACCOMPANIED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RED ARMY GREETED WITH A RISING OVATION
NOT ONE SOLDIER SHALL LEAVE HIS DIVISION WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE COMMITTEE
THE BOURGEOISIE IS IN CONTROL BUT THIS CONTROL IS MASKED BY A FICTITIOUS COALITION WITH THE OBORONTSI PARTIES
WHETHER WE MOVE OR NOT THE OTHER SIDE KNOWS IT MUST FINISH US OR BE FINISHED THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS MEETING DAY AND NIGHT
THE LIGHTS CAME OUT
THE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI RUSSKAYA VOLIA OCTOBER 28
HERE'S A PROCLAMATION FROM KRASNOV HE CRIED
ALL AVAILABLE FORCES MUST BE HURRIED THERE
THE BOLSHEVIK SPEAKER SHOUTED TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD THAT THE DECISION OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS MEANT THAT ALL RUSSIA BACKED UP THE ACTION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
FOURTEEN YUNKERS OF THE PAVLOVSK SCHOOL HAVE BEEN STRIPPED AND TORTURED BY THE BOLSHEVIK GUARDS
OVER THEIR HEADS I CAUGHT SIGHT OF AN OFFICER LOOKING HELPLESS AND SHOUTED TO HIM
BY RESOLUTION OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS ALL ARRESTED MEMBERS OF LAND COMMITTEES ARE IMMEDIATELY SET FREE
AN ENORMOUS ELEPHANT-COLOURED ARMOURED AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO RED FLAGS FLYING FROM THE TURRET LUMBERED OUT WITH SCREAMING SIREN
IN THESE CONDITIONS THE CLOSING OF THE NEWSPAPERS IS A LEGITIMATE MEASURE OF DEFENCE THEN PASSING TO THE QUESTION OF THE PRESS AFTER THE VICTORY TROTZKY CONTINUED
WHY ON THE CORNER OF THE SADOVAYA TO-DAY I SAW A RED GUARD TRY TO STOP A BOY SELLING SOLDATSKI GOLOS
I AM OPEN TO CONVICTION FOR I DO NOT KNOW YOUR COUNTRY
I AM FORTY-FIVE YEARS OLD AND IN ALL MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO MANY WORDS AS IN THIS PLACE IN THE CORRIDOR I MET PROFESSOR SHATSKY A RAT-FACED INDIVIDUAL IN A DAPPER FROCK-COAT VERY INFLUENTIAL IN THE COUNCILS OF THE CADET PARTY
NOW AN INSIGNIFICANT GROUP OF PEASANT ANARCHISTS
PESHEKHANOV TCHAIKOVSKY
WE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BOURGEOISIE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO PREVENT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE DIRTY IGNORANT PEOPLE
HE INVITED US TO MARCH WITH THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN THE FUNERAL PROCESSION NEXT MORNING
TO GO TO THE FRONT
FOR TWO RUBLES I BOUGHT A TICKET ENTITLING ME TO DINNER AND STOOD IN LINE WITH A THOUSAND OTHERS WAITING TO GET TO THE LONG SERVING-TABLES WHERE TWENTY MEN AND WOMEN WERE LADLING FROM IMMENSE CAULDRONS CABBAGE SOUP HUNKS OF MEAT AND PILES OF KASHA SLABS OF BLACK BREAD
OUR DUTY IS TO LET THE POPULATION KNOW OF THIS
IF RUMOURS ARE TRUE THAT CERTAIN GENERALS IN THE PROVINCES ARE ATTEMPTING TO PROFIT BY EVENTS IN ORDER TO MARCH ON PETROGRAD WITH OTHER DESIGNS IT IS ONLY ONE MORE PROOF THAT WE MUST ESTABLISH A SOLID BASE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD ORDERED HIM TO REMAIN AND CONTINUE HIS WORK
THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE DEPENDING UPON THE PASSIONS OF THE UNBRIDLED MASSES
OUR ADVANCED UNITS OCCUPIED THE NORTHEASTERN EXTREMITY OF TSARSKOYE SELO AND THE STATION ALEXANDROVSKAYA
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIES V
DOWN WITH THE LANDOWNERS AND THE KORNILOVIST-GENERALS
WITH THEM IT IS TRUE THE WORKERS AND THE SOLDIER-MASSES--THE PEASANTS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY--BUT AFTER ALL THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE A POLITICAL FACTION NOT RICH IN TRAINED AND EDUCATED MEN
IT MAY EASILY HAPPEN THAT NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE STATE OF MIND OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS INDIVIDUAL HOT-HEADS WILL CALL OUT PART OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS ON THE STREETS INCITING THEM TO AN UPRISING
BUT WE CANNOT WAIT HE SAID
AND THE IMPERIAL MONOGRAMS AND EAGLES WERE EITHER TORN DOWN OR COVERED UP
THE SOLDIERS SAILORS AND WORKERS OF PETROGRAD HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY CAN AND WILL WITH ARMS IN THEIR HANDS ENFORCE THE WILL AND AUTHORITY OF THE DEMOCRACY
I DO NOT COME HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS SAID LENIN AND WAITED AGAIN FOR THE NOISE TO SUBSIDE BUT AS A MEMBER OF THE BOLSHEVIK FACTION DULY ELECTED TO THIS CONGRESS AND HE HELD HIS CREDENTIALS UP TO THAT ALL MIGHT SEE THEM
AND IT WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FEARFUL REPORTS THAT WE DECIDED TO GO THERE
WE CONSIDER THAT ONLY THE CREATION OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT CAN POSSIBLY GUARANTEE THE RESULTS OF THE HEROIC STRUGGLE OF THE WORKING-CLASS AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
AT THE FIRST CROSS-ROADS TWO SOLDIERS RAN OUT IN FRONT OF US WAVING THEIR RIFLES
ON NOVEMBER 8TH THEY OFFERED PORTFOLIOS TO MEMBERS OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WHO DECLINED
NOW WILL YOU TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THE PEOPLE ANY MORE DEMANDED CLAMOURING VOICES
IT WAS THRONGED WITH RED GUARDS STUMBLING ALONG ON FOOT TOWARD THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT SHOUTING AND SINGING
STANDING ON THE STEPS A MEMBER OF THE VIKZHEL WAS PLEADING WITH THEM
TO THE EARS OF THE DEVOUT SOUNDED THE SHOCK OF GUNS CRASHING IN THE FACE OF THE HOLY ORTHODOX CHURCH AND POUNDING TO DUST THE SANCTUARY OF THE RUSSIAN NATION
THE PEOPLE RAPIDLY DESERTED THEM AND WENT OVER TO THE BOLSHEVIKI WHO STOOD FOR PEACE LAND AND WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY AND A GOVERNMENT OF THE WORKING-CLASS
I ORDER ALL THE DESIGNATED UNITS TO ADVANCE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
THE REGIMENT HELD A MEETING TO DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE
WE CALL UPON ALL SANE ELEMENTS TO GROUP THEMSELVES AROUND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION AND TO PREPARE THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO BE READY AT THE FIRST CALL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING
ALTHOUGH IT WAS SIX IN THE MORNING NIGHT WAS YET HEAVY AND CHILL
IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VLADIMIR ULIANOV-LENIN
KERENSKY MADE THE GREAT MISTAKE
THE SOVIET OF MOSCOW HAD SET UP A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND WAS NEGOTIATING WITH THE COMMANDANT OF THE CITY FOR POSSESSION OF THE ARSENAL SO THAT THE WORKERS MIGHT BE ARMED
INDEED THEY STOOD THERE JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR IN THE FEEBLE LIGHT OF AN OIL LAMP GROUPED AROUND THE MAYOR AND TALKING EXCITEDLY
IN THE PALE HALF-LIGHT A LITTLE GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN WERE GATHERED BEFORE THE SOVIET HEADQUARTERS WITH A SHEAF OF GOLD-LETTERED RED BANNERS--THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MOSCOW SOVIETS
TO ANNOUNCE THE INVIOLABILITY OF PRIVATE DWELLINGS
ALL PLOTS OF LAND SCIENTIFICALLY CULTIVATED--GARDENS PLANTATIONS NURSERIES SEED-PLOTS GREEN-HOUSES AND OTHERS--SHALL NOT BE DIVIDED BUT TRANSFORMED INTO MODEL FARMS AND PASS INTO THE HANDS OF THE STATE OR OF THE COMMUNITY ACCORDING TO THEIR SIZE AND IMPORTANCE
AS WE CAME DOWN THE NEVSKY A LITTLE AFTER MIDDAY THE WHOLE STREET BEFORE THE DUMA BUILDING WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE
THE USURPERS WITH THE WORDS LIBERTY AND SOCIALISM ON THEIR LIPS HAVE SET UP A RULE OF ARBITRARY VIOLENCE
DESPITE THE DIFFICULT DAYS THROUGH WHICH THE COUNTRY IS PASSING IRRESPONSIBLE APPEALS TO ARMED DEMONSTRATIONS AND MASSACRES ARE STILL BEING SPREAD AROUND PETROGRAD AND FROM DAY TO DAY ROBBERY AND DISORDER INCREASE
THE BOURGEOIS PRESS HAD TEMPORARILY DISAPPEARED...._PRAVADA HAD AN ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE NEW TSAY-EE-KAH NOW THE PARLIAMENT OF THE RUSSIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC
FOR SPIES CONTINUALLY SNEAKED THROUGH
ALL OUT WERE HEARD FAR AND NEAR WITHIN AND THE ARMY BEGAN TO POUR THROUGH THE DOOR JOSTLING EXPOSTULATING ARGUING
TO ALL HONEST CITIZENS THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DECREES SPOLIATORS MARAUDERS SPECULATORS ARE DECLARED TO BE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE
THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS REVOLUTION CURSES THOSE WHO REMAIN EVEN FOR A MOMENT UNDER THE FLAG OF THE PEOPLE'S ENEMIES
YOU ARE PAID SIXTY RUBLES A MONTH AND HAVE TO WORK TEN HOURS AND MORE
BUT ALL THE PARTIES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY MUST PRESENT A UNITED FRONT
TCHERNOV HOWEVER SPOKE SEVERAL TIMES WITH A MODEST AND WINNING IMPARTIALITY
THE GARRISON IS DIVIDED
THAT WAS THE ONLY DAMAGE DONE BY THE BOMBARDMENT
THE CONSTITUTION OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT COMPOSED OF ALL THE PARTIES OF THE SOVIET IS INDISPENSABLE TO PREVENT A NEW FLOW OF BLOOD THE COMING FAMINE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REVOLUTION BY THE KALEDINISTS TO ASSURE THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AT THE PROPER TIME AND TO APPLY EFFECTIVELY THE PROGRAMME ADOPTED BY THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
THE GREAT SEMI-CIRCLE OF GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS SEEMED DESERTED
A NUMBER OF HUGE PACKING CASES STOOD ABOUT AND UPON THESE THE RED GUARDS AND SOLDIERS FELL FURIOUSLY BATTERING THEM OPEN WITH THE BUTTS OF THEIR RIFLES AND PULLING OUT CARPETS CURTAINS LINEN PORCELAIN PLATES GLASSWARE
THEY WERE HALTED BY A SOLDIER
AT THIS MOMENT WE ARE NOT ONLY TRYING TO SOLVE THE LAND QUESTION BUT THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL REVOLUTION--NOT ONLY HERE IN RUSSIA BUT ALL OVER THE WORLD
ALL POWER--TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
THE MACHINE-GUN IN THE TURRET OF THE THING SLEWED AROUND AND SPAT A HAIL OF BULLETS INDISCRIMINATELY INTO THE WOOD-PILES AND THE CROWD
ALL THE RESERVES WHICH THEY POSSESS WILL BE REQUISITIONED
WE MUST ACT ON THE 7TH THE DAY THE CONGRESS MEETS SO THAT WE MAY SAY TO IT HERE IS THE POWER
AT THIS VERY MOMENT CROWDS OF THEM BEWILDERED AND ASHAMED WERE UP AT SMOLNY TRYING TO EXPLAIN
THE CHAUFFEUR PRETENDED TO BE WOUNDED AND THEY LET HIM GO FREE--TO RUN TO THE DUMA AND SWELL THE TALE OF BOLSHEVIK ATROCITIES....AMONG THE DEAD WAS A BRITISH OFFICER
ON THAT NIGHT NOT A SINGLE HOLD-UP OCCURRED NOT A SINGLE ROBBERY
YOU KNOW ME
PERHAPS THEY WERE SAYING TO THEMSELVES NOW WE ARE MASTERS HOW CAN WE DO OUR WILL AT OUR APARTMENT-HOUSE WE WERE HELD UP IN THE DARK BY AN ARMED PATROL OF CITIZENS AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED
THE BOLSHEVIKI CANNOT KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO THE MASSES EVEN IN THE COUNTRY ITSELF
SUDDENLY ANOTHER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE
ONE STOOD ALONE IN THE CENTRE OF THE PLACE UNDER THE LIGHT AND ROUND IT WERE GATHERED SOME TWO THOUSAND DUN-COLORED SOLDIERS ALMOST LOST IN THE IMMENSITY OF THAT IMPERIAL BUILDING
ANOTHER DELEGATE CLIMBED UP BESIDE HIM AND POINTED AT THE PRESIDIUM
IN UKRAINE IN FINLAND POLAND WHITE RUSSIA THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS GATHERED STRENGTH AND BECAME BOLDER
DAY BROKE ON A CITY IN THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT AND CONFUSION A WHOLE NATION HAVING UP IN LONG HISSING SWELLS OF STORM
AT ONCE THE GARRISON DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS--THE OFFICERS LOYAL TO KERENSKLY
BUT MY DEAR SIR ALLOW ME TO OUTLINE TO YOU MY PLAN FOR A FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
A FOUL BLUE CLOUD OF CIGARETTE SMOKE ROSE FROM THE MASS AND HUNG IN THE THICK AIR
A FREIGHT-TRAIN SWARMING WITH TROOPS AND LIT UP BY HUGE BONFIRES WAS HALTED ON A SIDING
DIEDONENKO ANNOUNCED DRAMATICALLY THAT THE GARRISON WAS WAVERING
ALL CLASSES ARE REPRESENTED IN THE MUNICIPALITIES
AS I WENT DOWN THE STAIRS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IN SPITE OF THE BITTER WRANGLING NO REAL VOICE FROM THE ROUGH WORLD OUTSIDE COULD PENETRATE THIS HIGH COLD HALL AND THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS WRECKED--ON THE SAME ROCK OF WAR AND PEACE THAT HAD WRECKED THE MILIUKOV MINISTRY
PREMIER KERENSKY AND HIS FOLLOWERS AWAIT SPEEDY AND WELL-DESERVED PUNISHMENT
ONLY THE SAME PLATITUDES ABOUT CRUSHING GERMAN MILITARISM WITH THE HELP OF THE ALLIES--ABOUT THE STATE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA ABOUT THE EMBARRASSMENT CAUSED BY SKOBELIEV'S NAKAZ HE ENDED WITH THE KEY-NOTE
FOR MANY YEARS THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN IN SUCH A DISTURBED CONDITION THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY OF INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR MIDST BUT OF A LARGE PART OF THE EQUALLY REVOLUTIONARY EDUCATED CLASS WHO HAVE TURNED TO THE WORKING PEOPLE WITH THEIR IDEAS FOR THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL REGENERATION OF RUSSIA
THERE WAS A FEARFUL WRANGLE OVER WHO SHOULD BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
EMISSARIES WERE SENT TO THE PROVINCES WHERE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LAND COMMITTEES THEY SEIZED THE STORE-HOUSES OF THE GREAT GRAIN-DEALERS
GENERAL ALEXEYEV WEPT
ALL THE COMPLEX ROUTINE OF COMMON LIFE--HUMDRUM EVEN IN WAR-TIME--PROCEEDED AS USUAL
ONE CONFIDED TO ME IN STRICTEST SECRECY THAT THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION WOULD BEGIN AT MIDNIGHT
THEN THE ROAD TO PETROGRAD WILL BE OPEN TO WILHELM
AFTER A FEW MINUTES TWO OF THE COMPANIES SHOULDERED ARMS WITH A CLASH BARKED THREE SHARP SHOUTS AND WENT SWINGING OFF ACROSS THE SQUARE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE RED ARCH INTO THE QUIET CITY
I PRODUCED THE PAPERS
THE BOLSHEVIK AND LEFT SOCIAL REVOLUTIONARY FACTIONS WERE IN SESSION IN THEIR OWN ROOMS
WE HAVE JUST PASSED A RESOLUTION ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS
HERE IS A LIST OF THEIR SERVICES.(SEE APP
THE MILITARY-REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DECEMBER 7TH 1917
HE LENIN THE USURPER THE TYRANT WHOSE COMMISSARS HAD SEIZED THE MUNICIPAL GARAGE ENTERED THE MUNICIPAL WARE HOUSES WERE INTERFERING WITH THE SUPPLY COMMITTEES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD--HE PRESUMED TO DEFINE THE LIMITS OF POWER OF THE FREE INDEPENDENT AUTONOMOUS CITY GOVERNMENT
S.R.S.D SOVIET RABOTCHIKH SOLDATSKIKH DEPUTATOV
AMBULANCES FULL OF WOUNDED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE BATTLE AND ONCE A PEASANT CART CREAKING SLOWLY ALONG IN WHICH SAT A WHITE-FACED BOY BENT OVER HIS SHATTERED STOMACH AND SCREAMING MONOTONOUSLY
BUT THE ANSWER OF THE LENINITES WAS SWIFT AND RUTHLESS
WHAT ORGANISATION AUTHORISES THESE AGITATORS WHO PREACH INSURRECTION
THE SOVIETS ARE THE MOST PERFECT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE--OF THE WORKERS IN THE FACTORIES AND MINES OF THE WORKERS IN THE FIELDS
SUGAR ONE WAS ENTITLED TO AT THE RATE OF TWO POUNDS A MONTH--IF ONE COULD GET IT AT ALL WHICH WAS SELDOM
WE ARE IN FAVOUR OF INSURRECTION
KERENSKY TERESTCHENKO AND NEKRASSOV MUST IMMEDIATELY ANSWER US CONCERNING THE WORDS OF VERKHOVSKY
IT WILL MAKE BLOODSHED SMOLNY WAS TENSER THAN EVER IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE
NOR BY THE ORGANIZED VIOLENCE OF A SMALL CLIQUE
YOUR SOVIETS ARE NOW THE ORGANS OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER
THEY HOPE TO TRANSFORM EVERY DEMONSTRATION OF SOLDIERS AND WORKERS INTO A POGROM WHICH WILL FRIGHTEN THE PEACEFUL POPULATION AND THROW IT INTO THE ARMS OF THE RESTORERS OF LAW AND ORDER
THE RED GUARD TO BE DISARMED AND THE PETROGRAD GARRISON TO BE PLACED AT THE ORDERS OF THE DUMA
RECEIVERS OF STOLEN GOODS ANTIQUARIANS AND ALL WHO ARE PROVED TO BE HIDING SUCH OBJECTS WILL BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE AND PUNISHED WITH ALL SEVERITY
THE HISTORY OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AFTER THE REVOLUTION IS A HISTORY OF THEIR STEADY GROWTH
NOVEMBER 11TH IN THE CLUB OF THE PREOBRAZHENSKY REGIMENT WAS HELD AN EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE UNITS OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISON
TWO QUESTIONS SEEMED TO BE UPPERMOST IN ALL MINDS SHOCKED BY THE FEROCITY OF THE CIVIL WAR
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 300 DELEGATES | ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS WORKERS SOLDIERS | | | PEASANTS DEPUTIES | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 300 DELEGATES | COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 300 DELEGATES | MUNICIPALITIES | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 150 DELEGATES | ARMY COMMITTEES AT THE FRONT | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 150 DELEGATES | PROVINCIAL ZEMSTVOS | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 200 DELEGATES | TRADE UNIONS | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 100 DELEGATES | NATIONALIST ORGANISATIONS | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 200 DELEGATES | SEVERAL SMALL GROUPS |

IT WAS DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE REBELS AND GENERAL ZANKIEVITCH ORDERED ALL SOLDIERS LOYAL TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO LEAVE THE CAMP OF COURTINE AND TO CARRY WITH THEM ALL AMMUNITION
THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE UNITED SOCIAL DEMOCRATS SUPPORTED MARTOV'S PROPOSITION
THE ACTIVE ARMY CONSIDERS THESE CRIMINALS WITH HORROR AND CONTEMPT
AS FOR THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT DEPEND UPON THE SOVIETS BUT IT CONSIDERS IT REGRETTABLE THAT THEY EXIST AT ALL AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER COSSACK MISSION CALLED UPON THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TREATING WITH HIM BOLDLY AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FREE COSSACK PEOPLE IN THE DON SOMETHING VERY LIKE A COSSACK REPUBLIC HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED
ALL CLASSES AND CLASS DIVISIONS ALL CLASS PRIVILEGES AND DELIMITATIONS ALL CLASS ORGANISATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS AND ALL CIVIL RANKS ARE ABOLISHED
XII PREFACE THIS BOOK IS A SLICE OF INTENSIFIED HISTORY--HISTORY AS I SAW IT
OF COURSE NODDED A YOUNG SERGEANT NAMED BAKLANOV WHO SPOKE FRENCH
WHEN THE PEASANTS BEGIN TO ACT THEN IT IS A QUESTION OF MINUTES BEFORE THEY ARE DONE FOR BUT THE PEASANTS--WILL THEY ACT
THE CHURCH OF ST BASIL WAS UNTOUCHED AS WAS THE GREAT IMPERIAL PALACE WITH ALL THE TREASURES OF MOSCOW AND PETROGRAD IN ITS CELLAR AND THE CROWN JEWELS IN THE TREASURY
16 EXPLAINING WHAT THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT WAS HOW THE PROPERTIED CLASSES THE TCHIN OVNIKI LANDLORDS BANKERS AND THEIR ALLIES THE COSSACK PRINCES LAND-OWNERS AND GENERALS WERE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REVOLUTION AND PREVENT THE CONFISCATION OF THEIR WEALTH BY THE PEOPLE
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME I SUPPOSE INTERRUPTED THE OTHER CONTEMPTUOUSLY THAT YOU BELIEVE LENIN IS A REAL FRIEND OF THE PROLETARIAT YES I DO ANSWERED THE SOLDIER SUFFERING
BY EVENING 8,300 MEN HAD SURRENDERED
THE LANDS OF PERSONS RETIRING FROM THE COMMUNITY RETURN TO THE LAND FUND
TO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS DEPUTIES AND FACTORYSHOP COMMITTEES THE KORNILOVIST BANDS OF KERENSKY ARE THREATENING THE APPROACHES TO THE CAPITAL
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT OUR ALLIES DO NOT CARE ABOUT US
DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE LYING DECLARATIONS OF THE IMPOTENT BOURGEOIS CONSPIRATORS WHO WILL BE PITILESSLY CRUSHED
INTELLECTUALS WITH ALMOST THE SAME PROGRAMME AS THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS EXCEPT THAT THE NOVAYA ZHIZN GROUP REFUSED TO BE TIED TO EITHER OF THE TWO GREAT FACTIONS
THE FIRST CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR PROCLAIMED THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA TO SELF-DETERMINATION
I HAVE REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTION IN THE PRESENT CIVIL WAR HOWEVER FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE IN TAKING UP ARMS AGAINST MY BROTHER RUSSIANS PROVOCATOR
DAY AFTER DAY THE BOLSHEVIK ORATORS TOURED THE BARRACKS AND FACTORIES VIOLENTLY DENOUNCING THIS GOVERNMENT OF CIVIL WAR ONE SUNDAY WE WENT ON A TOP-HEAVY STEAM TRAM THAT LUMBERED THROUGH OCEANS OF MUD BETWEEN STARK FACTORIES AND IMMENSE CHURCHES TO OBUKHOVSKY ZAVOD A GOVERNMENT MUNITIONS-PLANT OUT ON THE SCHLUESSELBURG PROSPEKT
JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE BOLSHEVIKI HADN'T ENOUGH MEN TO RUN THEIR GROWING PARTY--A WORK ABOVE ALL OF SPEAKERS AND WRITERS
WE WILL DO SOMETHING WHAT WILL YOU DO
NAVY THE SAILOR KORBIR
DO NOT BELIEVE THE FALSEHOOD WHICH IRRESPONSIBLE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUGGEST TO YOU BY SPREADING TERRIBLE CALUMNIES AGAINST THE EMPLOYEES OF THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES AND THE WORKERS IN OTHER SUPPLY ORGANISATIONS WHO ARE LABOURING IN THESE DARK DAYS FOR THE SALVATION OF RUSSIA
SHEVERDIN-MAKSIMENKO
BUT YOU HAVEN'T THE COURAGE TO TRY IT THEN SKOBELIEV LOOKING LIKE A MATINEE IDOL WITH HIS SOFT BLOND BEARD AND WAVY YELLOW HAIR RATHER APOLOGETICALLY DEFENDING THE SOVIET NAKAZ TERESTCHENKO FOLLOWED ASSAILED FROM THE LEFT BY CRIES OF RESIGNATION
RYKOV
RYKOV
IT IS ONLY FROM THE GREAT COSSACK LANDLORDS THAT THE REVOLUTION WILL CONFISCATE THE LAND TO GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE
ALMOST EVERYBODY FROM THE SCHOOL-BOY UP WORE HIS PRESCRIBED UNIFORM WITH THE INSIGNIA OF THE EMPEROR ON BUTTON AND SHOULDER-STRAP
THE OTHER SIDE KNEW JUST WHAT IT WANTED
ALL DELAY OR NON-EXECUTION OF THIS ORDER WILL BE CONSIDERED AS AN ACT OF TREASON TO THE REVOLUTION
TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOVIET SKOBELIEV SQUARE TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE FOR THE FINANCE COUNCIL
COMRADES WORKERS SOLDIERS PEASANTS--ALL TOILERS
COUNT TOLSTOY HE ANSWERED BOWING STIFFLY
ONE GARRISON REGIMENT BADLY DEMORALISED BY LONG INACTIVITY HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY BOTH SIDES
5 WILL THEY CONSENT TO THE ARREST OF KERENSKY KRASNOV AND SAVINKOV
OTHER COMMISSARS WITHOUT RESIGNING THEIR POSITIONS SIGNED THE DECLARATION--RIAZANOV DERBYCHEV OF THE PRESS DEPARTMENT ARBUZOV OF THE GOVERNMENT PRINTING-PLANT YURENIEV OF THE RED GUARD FEODOROV OF THE COMMISSARIAT OF LABOUR AND LARIN SECRETARY OF THE SECTION OF ELABORATION OF DECREES
WHEN THE REVOLUTION BROKE OUT IN MARCH 1917 THE CADETS FORMED THE FIRST PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
A BATTERED SAMOVAR COLD STOOD ON THE COUNTER AND MANY GLASSES HOLDING DREGS OF TEA
THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY HOWEVER LAY NOT IN COMPOSITION OF SUCH A GOVERNMENT BUT IN ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE PROGRAMME OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
ONE HAS GONE MAD
AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION THE ZEMSTVOS WERE DEMOCRATIZED WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THEM THE ORGANS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS
THE GENERAL LINE OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY EVERY GENUINELY DEMOCRATIC POWER MUST IN THE DOMAIN OF EDUCATION IN A COUNTRY WHERE ILLITERACY AND IGNORANCE REIGN SUPREME MAKE ITS FIRST AIM THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS DARKNESS
COMRADE ZALKING WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE UPRAVA CENTRAL BUREAU OF THE WARD DUMA REMEMBERED ALL AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS LYING IN THE MEETING-ROOM OF THE UPRAVA A MACHINEGUN WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED FROM THE GERMANS
SOVIET TROOPS SURROUNDED THE BUILDING AND OPENED FIRE TWO ARMOURED CARS CRUISING BACK AND FORTH WITH MACHINE GUNS RAKING IT
YESTERDAY YOU STRUCK DOWN THE TYRANNY OF THE BOURGEOIS GANG

WE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT WHEN WE REACHED A POSITION OF POWER WE WOULD CLOSE THE BOURGEOIS PRESS
HERE ON FESTAL OCCASIONS HAD BEEN BANKED BRILLIANT MILITARY AND ECCLESIASTICAL UNIFORMS A SETTING FOR GRAND DUCHESSES
PROPAGANDA OF ANTINATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL IDEAS AND THEORIES DENY THE NECESSITY FOR ARMIES AND HURT DISCIPLINE
AND ON THE 6TH ALL THE DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS WILL NOT HAVE ARRIVED
WHEN ONE MAKES A REVOLUTION ONE CANNOT MARK TIME
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING TO AVOID THE ONCOMING FAMINE BUT IF UNDER THESE DIFFICULT CONDITIONS OUR WORK IS COMPELLED TO STOP LET THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT OUR FAULT 15
AT A MEETING OF THE CADET PARTY HELD AT RIAZAN M
BRONSTEIN TROTZKY JUSTICE G
AN EDICT FROM THE SOCIALIST MINISTER OF LABOUR ORDERED ALL THE WORKERS COMMITTEES HENCEFORTH TO MEET ONLY AFTER WORKING HOURS
THESE CONSIDERATIONS ON THE DANGERS OF ISOLATION OF OUR PARTY ARE NOT NEW
A LOW-CEILINGED LOUD PLACE CALLED UNCLE TOM'S CABIN MUCH FREQUENTED BY RED GUARDS
THERE WILL BE MUCH SHOOTING HE SAID
FOR MONTHS IN PETROGRAD AND ALL OVER RUSSIA EVERY STREET-CORNER WAS A PUBLIC TRIBUNE
AND S
THIS IS A LIE
EVERYWHERE ON ALL THE WALLS HYSTERICAL APPEALS TO THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN CALM POLKOVNIKOV EMITTED PRIKAZ AFTER PRIKAZ I ORDER ALL MILITARY UNITS AND DETACHMENTS TO REMAIN IN THEIR BARRACKS UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS FROM THE STAFF OF THE MILITARY DISTRICT
IT OPENED AND IN IT STOOD THE FIGURE OF THE COLONEL
STILL THE CROWDS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND SAILORS POURING IN AND OUT STILL THE CHOKING PRESS OF TRUCKS ARMOURED CARS CANNON BEFORE THE DOOR AND THE SHOUTING THE LAUGHTER OF UNWONTED VICTORY
THUS UPON ALL THE POINTS OF ATTACK AUTOMATICALLY CONVERGED ANGRY HUMAN SWARMS TO BE MET BY COMMISSARS AND ASSIGNED POSITIONS OR WORK TO DO
WE ARE COMMITTING THAT CRIME AND YET I AM NOT THE ENEMY OF THESE REFORMS BECAUSE I AM A SOCIALIST CRIES FROM THE LEFT WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU MIGHTY APPLAUSE FROM THE RIGHT
THE SOCIALISTS OF GERMANY AND OF THE ALLIED COUNTRIES CONTEMPLATED THESE GENTLEMEN WITH ILL-CONCEALED CONTEMPT BUT THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS FOR RUSSIA AND SENT US SOME APOSTLES OF THE UNIVERSAL CONFLAGRATION
IF WE ARE GOING TO NATIONALISE THE BANKS CAN WE THEN TOLERATE THE FINANCIAL JOURNALS
COMMANDEER ANOTHER MACHINE SUGGESTED DYBENKO WAVING HIS REVOLVER
KERENSKY IS TO ENTER THE TOWN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK WHERE ARE THE COSSACKS ABOUT A MILE OVER THAT WAY HE WAVED HIS ARM
KERENSKY IN FLIGHT LEAVING PETROGRAD IN THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 7TH KERENSKY ARRIVED BY AUTOMOBILE AT GATCHINA WHERE HE DEMANDED A SPECIAL TRAIN
ON THE SECOND FLOOR BILLIARD-ROOMS CARD-ROOMS A LIBRARY OPENED FROM THE HALL
VOTE
KERENSKY ANSWERED TO ASK THE COSSACKS ASSISTANCE IN CRUSHING THE BOLSHEVIK INSURRECTION AT THIS THERE WERE VIOLENT PROTESTATIONS WHICH INCREASED WHEN HE CONTINUED I BROKE THE KORNILOV ATTEMPT AND I WILL BREAK THE BOLSHEVIKI THE NOISE BECAME SO GREAT THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE THE PLATFORM
ALL POINTED TO THE FACT THAT THERE WERE STRONG CURRENTS ON BOTH SIDES FAVOURABLE TO PATCHING UP A PEACE AT THE EXPENSE OF RUSSIA
MYSTERIOUS INDIVIDUALS CIRCULATED AROUND THE SHIVERING WOMEN WHO WAITED IN QUEUE LONG COLD HOURS FOR BREAD AND MILK WHISPERING THAT THE JEWS HAD CORNERED THE FOOD SUPPLY--AND THAT WHILE THE PEOPLE STARVED THE SOVIET MEMBERS LIVED LUXURIOUSLY
WE'RE RED GUARDS AND WE THUNDERED IMPERIOUSLY ON WHILE VLADIMIR NICOLAIEVITCH BELLOWED TO ME ABOUT THE INTERNATIONALISATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL AND SUCH MATTERS
WHEN HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF HEARD THE CAPTAIN STOOD UP
MODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI DIELO NARODA OCTOBER 28 SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY THE MOST FRIGHTFUL CRIME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AGAINST THE REVOLUTION IS THAT THEY IMPUTE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE BAD INTENTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT ALL THE CALAMITIES WHICH THE MASSES ARE SO CRUELLY SUFFERING
OUR ANSWER WILL BE DECISIVE
WE HAVE PROMISED TO CLOSE THESE NEWSPAPERS AND WE SHALL DO IT
THE PROFESSOR WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT AND THEN TRAVELLED AROUND THE COUNTRY VISITING FACTORY TOWNS AND PEASANT COMMUNITIES--WHERE TO HIS ASTONISHMENT THE REVOLUTION SEEMED TO BE SPEEDING UP
| 1233 | | CLOTH | | | | | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | MEN'S SHOES | PAIR | 12
ALL REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA AND THE ENTIRE WORLD HAVE THEIR EYES ON US
THESE BOLSHEVIKI WILL TRY TO DICTATE TO THE INTELLIGENTZIA WE'LL SHOW THEM
DID HE MEAN TO INFER THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THESE--THESE ANIMALS--AND US REMAIN
HE HAD BEEN INFORMED BY BUSINESS MEN AND INTELLECTUALS THAT THE REVOLUTION WAS SLOWING DOWN
HAVING SETTLED THE QUESTION OF POWER THE BOLSHEVIKI TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS OF PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATION
MARTOV SAYS THAT ONLY THE REVOLUTIONARY PRESSURE OF THE PROLETARIAT CAN CONDEMN AND CONQUER THE EVIL WILL OF IMPERIALIST CLIQUES AND BREAK DOWN THE DICTATORSHIP OF THESE CLIQUES
TROOPS WERE SAID TO BE MARCHING AGAINST PETROGRAD--A DELEGATION MUST BE SENT TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH
THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC WAS ONE CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL
NO DRINKING COMRADES
TO ONE AN OLDISH MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD HIS UNIFORM STUDDED WITH DECORATIONS WHO WAS POINTED OUT AS THE COLONEL WE SHOWED OUR BOLSHEVIK PAPERS
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MOST OF THE DELEGATES WERE HOSTILE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THESE WERE UNITED UNDER ONE CENTRAL ORGANISATION THE UNION OF UNIONS IN 1905 THE UNION OF UNIONS ACTED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY
WE CAN'T HOLD ON THEY CRIED
HORDES OF THE FEMALE INTELLIGENTZIA WENT TO HEAR LECTURES ON ART LITERATURE AND THE EASY PHILOSOPHIES
THAT'S A PROBLEM HE ADMITTED
HOUSE COMMITTEES DOORMEN JANITORS AND MILITIAMEN ARE CHARGED WITH THE DUTY OF KEEPING STRICT ORDER IN ALL HOUSES COURTYARDS AND IN THE STREETS AND HOUSE-DOORS AND CARRIAGE-ENTRANCES MUST BE LOCKED AT 9 O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AND OPENED AT 7 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THE GRAND IDEA OF THE DOMINATION OF THE WORKER AND PEASANT DEMOCRACY CLOSED THE RANKS OF THE ARMY AND HARDENED ITS WILL
THE FUNCTION OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES MUST BE LIMITED TO ECONOMIC QUESTIONS EXCLUSIVELY
THE BOLSHEVIKI THEN A SMALL POLITICAL SECT PUT THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF THE MOVEMENT
THE COMRADES WHO LEFT US ACTED LIKE DESERTERS BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY ABANDONED THE POSTS ENTRUSTED TO THEM BUT ALSO DISOBEYED THE DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF OUR PARTY TO THE EFFECT THAT THEY SHOULD AWAIT THE DECISIONS OF THE PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW PARTY ORGANISATIONS BEFORE RETIRING
JUST AS THE RED GUARDS ENTERED THE TOWN THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS WERE SHUT OFF PLUNGING THE STREETS IN COMPLETE DARKNESS
THERE WERE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM MEN IN FROCK COATS WELL-DRESSED WOMEN OFFICERS--ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE
AND THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THEM
THE TELEGRAPHERS DELEGATE DECLARED THAT THE OPERATORS HAD FLATLY REFUSED TO WORK THEIR INSTRUMENTS AS LONG AS THE BOLSHEVIK COMMISSAR WAS IN THE OFFICE
BUT THE MASSES WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT
POLISH SOCIAL DEMOCRACY SUPPORT
GLORY TO THE WARRIORS OF THE REVOLUTION THE SOLDIERS AND THE OFFICERS WHO WERE FAITHFUL TO THE PEOPLE
THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE IGNORANT SOLDIERS AND WORKERS SEDUCED BY THEM CRY SENSELESSLY
CHAPTER III ON THE EVE IN THE RELATIONS OF A WEAK GOVERNMENT AND A REBELLIOUS PEOPLE THERE COMES A TIME WHEN EVERY ACT OF THE AUTHORITIES EXASPERATES THE MASSES AND EVERY REFUSAL TO ACT EXCITES THEIR CONTEMPT
ARREST AND TURN OVER TO THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL OF THE PEOPLE EVERY ONE WHO INJURES THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE BY SABOTAGE IN PRODUCTION BY CONCEALMENT OF GRAIN-RESERVES RESERVES OF OTHER PRODUCTS BY RETARDING THE SHIPMENTS OF GRAIN BY BRINGING CONFUSION INTO THE RAILROADS THE POSTS AND THE TELEGRAPHS OR IN GENERAL OPPOSING THE GREAT WORK OF BRINGING PEACE AND TRANSFERRING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS
THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE SO-CALLED FREEDOM OF THE PRESS THE SIMPLE RETURN OF PRINTING PRESSES AND PAPER TO THE CAPITALISTS,--POISONERS OF THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE--THIS WOULD BE AN INADMISSIBLE SURRENDER TO THE WILL OF CAPITAL A GIVING UP OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION
BUT EVEN AMONG THE PEASANTS A REVOLUTIONARY WING WAS FORMING
IT IS TRUE THAT THE SOLDIER DOESN'T KNOW WHY HE IS FIGHTING BUT NOW YOU HAVE TOLD HIM THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR HIM TO FIGHT THAT WE HAVE NO NATIONAL INTERESTS AND THAT WE ARE FIGHTING FOR ALIEN ENDS PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE ALLIES WHO HE SAID WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AMERICA WILL YET SAVE THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY HE ENDED
BUT BY NOVEMBER 23D ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED HAD GATHERED IN PETROGRAD AND THE PARTY CAUCUSES HAD BEGUN
DO NOT YIELD TO PROVOCATION
YOU MUST OPPOSE THESE MANIACS WITH WHOM ARE JOINED ALL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY AND ORDER AND THE FOLLOWERS OF THE TSARIST REGIME IN ORDER TO WRECK THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DESTROY THE CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE FUTURE OF OUR DEAR FATHERLAND
REMEMBER WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
MANY LOOKED ANXIOUS
THEY WILL COME FROM THAT DIRECTION POINTING TOWARD THE ADMIRALTY
EVEN THIS PACKED ASSEMBLY AT FIRST VOTED FOR A COALITION GOVERNMENT WITHOUT THE CADETS ONLY KERENSKY'S OPEN THREAT OF RESIGNATION AND THE ALARMING CRIES OF THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS THAT THE REPUBLIC IS IN DANGER PERSUADED THE CONFERENCE BY A SMALL MAJORITY TO DECLARE IN FAVOUR OF THE PRINCIPLE OF COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE AND TO SANCTION THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SORT OF CONSULTATIVE PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE POWER CALLED THE PROVISIONAL COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
THREE HOURS PASSED WITHOUT ANY ACTION AND THEN AN OFFICER AND FIVE MEN WENT OUT ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE AND PUTTING TO FLIGHT A PICKET OF RED GUARDS OPENED THE NICOLAI BRIDGE
GO AWAY COMRADE YOU'LL GET HURT
SUCH AS A CONFERENCE OF REGIMENTAL COMMITTEES WITH DELEGATES FROM COMPANY COMMITTEES.--AUTHOR 5
IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN GOTZ TOOK THE CHAIR AND DAN ROSE TO SPEAK IN A TENSE SILENCE WHICH SEEMED TO ME ALMOST MENACING
THE GARRISON CONFERENCE SUMMONED AT THE INITIATIVE OF THE SEMIONOVSKY AND PREOBRAZHENSKY REGIMENTS ON HEARING THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES AND POPULAR ORGANISATIONS ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES FINDS THAT
ON THE 23D A FORMAL DECREE OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DISSOLVED THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
GENERALS WERE DISMISSED MINISTERS SUSPENDED FROM THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THE CABINET FELL
FROM THAT MOMENT THERE WERE NO MORE NEUTRAL SOLDIERS IN TSARSKOYE
WE COULD NO LONGER HEAR THE CANNON AND THE NEARER WE DREW TO THE WINTER PALACE END OF THE CITY THE QUIETER AND MORE DESERTED WERE THE STREETS
ON THE PRETEXT THAT PETROGRAD WAS IN DANGER THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT DREW UP PLANS FOR EVACUATING THE CAPITAL
THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE DRAWN UP DURING THE ARMISTICE WILL BE RATIFIED BY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
CLEAN-SHAVEN NOW BUT ALREADY BEGINNING TO BRISTLE WITH THE WELL-KNOWN BEARD OF HIS PAST AND FUTURE
I HAVE THEREFORE LIMITED THE WORD TO THESE BODIES AND WHEREVER ELSE IT OCCURS I HAVE TRANSLATED IT COUNCIL BESIDES THE LOCAL SOVIETS ELECTED IN EVERY CITY TOWN AND VILLAGE OF RUSSIA--AND IN LARGE CITIES ALSO WARD RAIONNY SOVIETS_--THERE ARE ALSO THE OBLASTNE OR GUBIERNSKY DISTRICT OR PROVINCIAL SOVIETS AND THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS IN THE CAPITAL CALLED FROM ITS INITIALS TSAY-EE-KAH SEE BELOW CENTRAL COMMITTEES ALMOST EVERYWHERE THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND OF SOLDIERS DEPUTIES COMBINED VERY SOON AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION
AFTER THE DISARMAMENT OF THE REBELS 81 ARRESTS WERE MADE THUS THE REPORT
WE HAVE WON THE RIGHT TO SIT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI HERE WITHIN THE WALLS OF SMOLNY INSTITUTE AND TO SPEAK FROM THIS TRIBUNE
INTERIOR AND JUSTICE RYKOV
THE RESULT WAS A DESIRE TO RETURN TO RUSSIA AND A HATRED TOWARD THE OFFICERS
WILL THEY EXTRADITE BERKMAN TO SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER ALL DELIVERED IN A SHOUT ABOVE THE ROARING OF THE TRUCK WHILE WE HELD ON TO EACH OTHER AND DANCED AMID THE CAROMING BOMBS
SOVIET THE WORD SOVIET MEANS COUNCIL UNDER THE TSAR THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL OF STATE WAS CALLED GOSUDARSTVENNYI SOVIET SINCE THE REVOLUTION HOWEVER THE TERM SOVIET HAS COME TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF PARLIAMENT ELECTED BY MEMBERS OF WORKING-CLASS ECONOMIC ORGANISATIONS--THE SOVIET OF WORKERS OF SOLDIERS OR OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES
RUSSIAN PASS TO REED TRANSLATION FOLLOWS PASS TO SMOLNY INSTITUTE ISSUED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVING ME THE RIGHT OF ENTRY AT ANY TIME
CHAPTER 8
THE LAND QUESTION CANNOT BE SOLVED INDEPENDENTLY OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION
THE FOLLOWING TABLE WAS COMPILED BY THE MUNICIPAL DUMA OF MOSCOW WHERE FOOD WAS CHEAPER AND MORE PLENTIFUL THAN IN PETROGRAD
DEEP HOSTILITY DIVIDED THE CHAMBER INTO IRRECONCILABLE GROUPS
THAT THE EXPRESSIONS AND THE STYLE OF A WHOLE SERIES OF ARTICLES IN RABOTCHI PUT AND SOLDAT RESEMBLE ABSOLUTELY THOSE OF NOVAYA RUS WE HAVE TO DO NOT SO MUCH WITH THE MOVEMENT OF SUCH AND SUCH POLITICAL PARTY AS WITH THE EXPLOITATION OF THE POLITICAL IGNORANCE AND CRIMINAL INSTINCTS OF A PART OF THE POPULATION A SORT OF ORGANISATION WHOSE OBJECT IT IS TO PROVOKE IN RUSSIA COST WHAT IT MAY AN INCONSCIENT MOVEMENT OF DESTRUCTION AND PILLAGE
NO ONE MEASURE IN THE DOMAIN OF THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION OUGHT TO BE ADOPTED BY ANY POWER WITHOUT THE ATTENTIVE DELIBERATION OF THOSE WHO REPRESENT THE PEDAGOGUES
BUT HERE THE SOLDIERS HAD THEIR SOVIET AND THE WORKERS THEIRS
THE ARMISTICE CONDITIONS PROPOSED BY THE MENSHEVIKI HE SAID HAD BEEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY REJECTED
TO CRUSH THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES PLANTS WERE SHUT DOWN AND FUEL AND RAW MATERIALS DIVERTED
IN THE STRUGGLE MY SYMPATHIES WERE NOT NEUTRAL
THIS WAS MENZHINSKY COMMISSAR OF FINANCE WHOSE QUALIFICATIONS WERE THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN CLERK IN A FRENCH BANK
THIS WAS THE SITUATION WHEN THE LONG-AWAITED ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE ALLIED CONFERENCE IN PARIS BROUGHT UP THE BURNING QUESTION OF FOREIGN POLICY
AND BACK OF THE BUNGLERS ARE THE GERMAN AGENTS
AND IN A FREE COUNTRY
AT THE CORNER OF THE NEVSKY I BOUGHT A PAMPHLET BY LENIN WILL THE BOLSHEVIKI BE ABLE TO HOLD THE POWER PAYING FOR IT WITH ONE OF THE STAMPS WHICH DID DUTY FOR SMALL CHANGE
AND THE RESULTS ARE VISIBLE
IT HAD NOT COME AS THEY EXPECTED IT WOULD COME NOR AS THE INTELLIGENTZIA DESIRED IT
THE LIST OF HIS SERVICES IS TOO LONG
THE WINDOWS OF SMOLNY WERE STILL ABLAZE MOTORS CAME AND WENT AND AROUND THE STILL-LEAPING FIRES THE SENTRIES HUDDLED CLOSE EAGERLY ASKING EVERYBODY THE LATEST NEWS
AND WHAT EFFORTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO USE TO MAKE THE SOLDIER MASSES AT THE FRONT UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS NOT BY THIS METHOD THAT THE RUSSIAN STATE MUST END THE WAR AND GUARANTEE ITS INTEREST HE SPOKE OF THE MIRACULOUS EFFECT OF THE JULY OFFENSIVE WHAT STRENGTH IT GAVE TO THE WORDS OF RUSSIAN AMBASSADORS ABROAD AND THE DESPAIR IN GERMANY CAUSED BY THE RUSSIAN VICTORIES
AT ONE PLACE WHERE A RIDICULOUS IRON SWAN SPAT UNCEASINGLY FROM AN ARTIFICIAL GROTTO WE WERE SUDDENLY AWARE OF OBSERVATION AND LOOKED UP TO ENCOUNTER THE SULLEN SUSPICIOUS GAZE OF HALF A DOZEN GIGANTIC ARMED SOLDIERS WHO STARED MOODILY DOWN FROM A GRASSY TERRACE
IF IN SPITE OF THE DESIRE EXPRESSED BY IT IT MATTERS LITTLE IF THAT DESIRE BE EXPRESSED BY THE PRESS BY POPULAR MEETINGS DECISIONS OF POLITICAL PARTIES OR BY DISORDERS AND RIOTS AGAINST NATIONAL OPPRESSION THAT NATION IS NOT GIVEN THE RIGHT OF DECIDING BY FREE VOTE--WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST CONSTRAINT AFTER THE COMPLETE DEPARTURE OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE NATION WHICH HAS ANNEXED IT OR WISHES TO ANNEX IT OR IS STRONGER IN GENERAL--THE FORM OF ITS NATIONAL AND POLITICAL ORGANISATION SUCH A UNION CONSTITUTES AN ANNEXATION--THAT IS TO SAY CONQUEST AND AN ACT OF VIOLENCE
AS HE READ THE LIST OF COMMISSARS BURSTS OF APPLAUSE AFTER EACH NAME LENIN'S AND TROTZKY'S ESPECIALLY
WE ARE GOING TO FOUND A POWER WHICH WILL HAVE NO OTHER AIM BUT TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF THE SOLDIERS WORKERS AND PEASANTS LENIN HAD APPEARED WELCOMED WITH A MIGHTY OVATION PROPHESYING WORLD-WIDE SOCIAL REVOLUTION
IN THE HIGH AMPHITHEATRICAL NICOLAI HALL THAT AFTERNOON I SAW THE DUMA SITTING IN PERMANENCE TEMPESTUOUS GROUPING AROUND IT ALL THE FORCES OF OPPOSITION
WELL SAID ONE I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM TAKE AWAY OUR LAND AGAIN NOW NEAR SMOLNY THE RED GUARD WAS LINED UP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET WILD WITH DELIGHT
TO AFFORD ASSISTANCE TO THE COMMISSARS IN PREVENTING UNWARRANTED SEARCHES IN HOUSES AND UNWARRANTED ARRESTS
THE REACTIONARIES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NO LONGER DARED OPENLY TO APPEAR
TO COPE WITH MONARCHIST MANIFESTATIONS AND POGROMIST MOVEMENTS IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE MEASURES TO SUPPRESS THESE MOVEMENTS AND FOR THIS PURPOSE TO CREATE AT PETROGRAD A COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND THE ORGANS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY ACTING IN CONTACT WITH THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SET UP DURING THE DAY TRIED TO INFORM THE GARRISON OF PSKOV
KERENSKY WAS THE LEADER OF THE TRUDOVIKI IN THE IMPERIAL DUMA WHEN THE REVOLUTION OF MARCH 1917 BROKE OUT
THROUGH ALL THE STREETS TO THE RED SQUARE THE TORRENTS OF PEOPLE POURED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF THEM ALL WITH THE LOOK OF THE POOR AND THE TOILING
WE ROSE BEFORE SUNRISE AND HURRIED THROUGH THE DARK STREETS TO SKOBELIEV SQUARE
THE PETROGRAD GARRISON NO LONGER RECOGNISES THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THEN NO BREAD WILL COME TO PETROGRAD THE CHILDREN WILL DIE OF HUNGER
HENCEFORTH THE POLICY OF A VOLUNTARY AND HONEST UNION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA MUST BE SUBSTITUTED
THE LEFT WING WAS IN CONTROL
WE TURNED TO THE FORBIDDEN DOOR SET IN A TEMPORARY PARTITION DIVIDING THE HALL AND LOCKED ON THE OUTSIDE
LET US REMEMBER THOSE WHO HAVE DIED FOR LIBERTY SO WE BEGAN TO SING THE FUNERAL MARCH THAT SLOW MELANCHOLY AND YET TRIUMPHANT CHANT SO RUSSIAN AND SO MOVING
THE HISTORY OF THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS SHOWS THAT THE MASSES HAVE LEFT THE MENSHEVIKI
THE DUMA MET DEFIANTLY PASSING RESOLUTIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WOULD DEFEND ITS POSITION TO THE LAST DROP OF ITS BLOOD AND APPEALING DESPERATELY TO THE POPULATION TO SAVE THEIR OWN ELECTED CITY GOVERNMENT BUT THE POPULATION REMAINED INDIFFERENT OR HOSTILE
IN THE MORNING WE WOKE TO WINDOW-LEDGES HEAPED WHITE AND SNOWFLAKES FALLING SO WHIRLING THICK THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE TEN FEET AHEAD
HE WAS INVITED TO SIT ON THE PLATFORM
A SPARK MIGHT KINDLE CIVIL WAR
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS PROPOSES TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TO TAKE THE MOST DECISIVE MEASURES TOWARDS THE UPROOTING OF SPECULATION SABOTAGE HIDING OF SUPPLIES FRAUDULENT DETENTION OF CARGOES ETC
THIS PART OF THE PALACE HAD BEEN ENTERED ALSO BY OTHER DETACHMENTS FROM THE SIDE OF THE NEVA
CHAPTER 11
AFTER A CRUEL FIGHT THE TROOPS OF THE PULKOVO DETACHMENT COMPLETELY ROUTED THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY FORCES WHO RETREATED FROM THEIR POSITIONS IN DISORDER AND UNDER COVER OF TSARSKOYE SELO FELL BACK TOWARD PAVLOVSK II AND GATCHINA
SIGNED COMMANDER IN CHIEF AVER ALL FORCES ACTING AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS OF KERENSKY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL MURAVIOV
WE MUST FURTHER PROCEED TO THE CONFISCATION OF PRIVATE PRINTING PLANTS AND SUPPLIES OF PAPER WHICH SHOULD BECOME THE PROPERTY OF THE SOVIETS BOTH IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE PROVINCES SO THAT THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND GROUPS CAN MAKE USE OF THE FACILITIES OF PRINTING IN PROPORTION TO THE ACTUAL STRENGTH OF THE IDEAS THEY REPRESENT--IN OTHER WORDS PROPORTIONALLY TO THE NUMBER OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS
COMRADES AND CITIZENS
TO THE RIGHT WAS A SPRINKLING OF OFFICERS EPAULETTES AND THE PATRIARCHAL BEARDED FACES OF THE OLDER MORE SUBSTANTIAL PEASANTS
ANOTHER OF THE NEW AGE OF BROTHERHOOD WHEN ALL THE PEOPLES WILL BECOME ONE GREAT FAMILY AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER CLAIMED THE FLOOR

THE LAST BANNERS PASSED AND THE LAST MOANING WOMEN LOOKING BACK WITH AWFUL INTENSITY AS THEY WENT
RIGA HAD BEEN SOLD TO THE GERMANS
AND A PERMANENT DICTATORSHIP OF RUSSIA BY THE INDUSTRIAL WORKERS WAS IMPOSSIBLE
SUCH SHEETS AS NOVAYA RUS ADVOCATED A GENERAL BOLSHEVIK MASSACRE
WE ARE DRAGGING THEM
AND COMBINED WITH SHREWDNESS THE GREATEST INTELLECTUAL AUDACITY
AND THE WORKMEN SEE APP
ANYBODY WHO ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY THE SOVIETS IS GUILTY OF AN ANTI-DEMOCRATIC AND COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ACT
ALL TO YOUR PLACES
3 THE QUESTION OF ALSACE-LORRAINE TO BE SOLVED BY A PLEBISCITE AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN TROOPS
COULD WE PERHAPS SEE THE PRISONERS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO PROVE TO THE WORLD NO SAID THE YOUNG SOLDIER IRRITABLY
THE PEDAGOGUES AND THE SOCIETISTS THE STATE COMMISSION WELCOMES THE PEDAGOGUES TO THE BRIGHT AND HONOURABLE WORK OF EDUCATING THE PEOPLE--THE MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY
WE ARE IN FAVOUR OF A SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT COMPOSED OF ALL THE PARTIES IN THE SOVIETS
IN SEPTEMBER 1917 WHEN I ARRIVED IN PETROGRAD THE AVERAGE DAILY WAGE OF A SKILLED INDUSTRIAL WORKER--FOR EXAMPLE A STEEL-WORKER IN THE PUTILOV FACTORY--WAS ABOUT 8 RUBLES
REALLY TO MAKE A DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT SAFEGUARDS THE INTERESTS OF THE MASSES OF PEASANTRY THE POOREST OF THEM
OF ORIGINAL VOLUME APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI 1
WE HAVE DONE OUR DUTY IN WARNING THOSE WHO PLAY WITH FIRE
AND THE DECREE ESTABLISHING A WORKERS MILITIA
YOU SEEM VERY SUCCESSFUL YES REPLIED KRYLENKO WITH A SORT OF DOGGEDNESS THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION IS A GREAT SUCCESS HE LAUGHED
WHAT RUSSIA NEEDS IS A STRONG MAN
THE REST CROWDED AROUND TO SEE
WE MUST HAVE REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE
SOLDIERS WHO WERE ORDERED TO ATTACK THE PRINT-SHOPS REFUSED
AFTER THE LAND DECREE ONE OF THE FIRST ACTIONS OF THE NEW TSAY-EE-KAH HAD BEEN TO CALL A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS OVER THE HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS
WE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND MADE FOR THE TSARSKOYE SELO STATION
PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE MANY HANDS DRAGGED THE SPOILERS DOWN
COMMISSARS CAME AND WENT RUNNING
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS FORMED BY THEIR SOCIAL POSITION SO DIFFERENT FROM THE POSITION OF THOSE RULING CLASSES AND INTELLECTUALS WHO HAVE HITHERTO CREATED CULTURE
AT A TABLE NEAR THE DOOR SAT THE FRENCH BESSARABIAN
BUT EVERY MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY HERE TALKS NOTHING BUT PARTY PROPAGANDA AND AT THE DOOR THEY DISTRIBUTE THEIR ILLEGAL NEWSPAPERS ISKRI SPARKS SOLDATSKI GOLOS AND RABOTCHAYA GAZETA INCITING TO INSURRECTION
SOME WORE RAGGED BANDAGES MARKED WITH BLOOD
THE PROPRIETORS OF NEWSPAPERS AND ADVERTISING OFFICES AS WELL AS ALL EMPLOYEES OF SUCH ESTABLISHMENTS SHOULD REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS UNTIL THE TRANSFER OF THE ADVERTISEMENT BUSINESS TO THE GOVERNMENT
AND WHEN THEY SAW US THEY STARTED UP WITH THEIR PINCHED FACES AND THE FLESH SHOWING BLUE THROUGH THEIR TORN CLOTHING DEMANDING EAGERLY DID YOU BRING ANYTHING TO READ WHAT THOUGH THE OUTWARD AND VISIBLE SIGNS OF CHANGE WERE MANY WHAT THOUGH THE STATUE OF CATHARINE THE GREAT BEFORE THE ALEXANDRINSKY THEATRE BORE A LITTLE RED FLAG IN ITS HAND AND OTHERS--SOMEWHAT FADED--FLOATED FROM ALL PUBLIC BUILDINGS
OF COURSE THE ORDER OF STATE AUTHORITY IN THE DOMAIN OF THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE NAME BOLSHEVIK CAN NOT BE TRANSLATED BY MAXIMALIST THE MAXIMALISTS ARE A SEPARATE GROUP
UNTIL FURTHER ORDER
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE DEVIL HIMSELF SAID THE SOLDIER HOTLY
THERE ISN'T ANY PEACEFUL SOLUTION BELLOWED THE CROWED
IF EUROPE IS TO REMAIN SPLIT INTO NATIONAL GROUPS THEN IMPERIALISM WILL RECOMMENCE ITS WORK
NOVEMBER 14TH
THE TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE PRIVATE BANKS IS ENTRUSTED TO THE BOARD OF THE STATE BANK
THEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AMID RISING ENTHUSIASM
WE'VE WON THE POWER
THERE WAS NO BATTLE
OCCASIONALLY WE BUMPED INTO A BURLY FIGURE STUMBLING ALONG IN THE DARK WHO ANSWERED QUESTIONS WITH THE USUAL YA NIEZNAYU 17 GOD SAVE THE TSAR GRAPHIC PAGE 166
IT WAS CAREFULLY NOTED DOWN BY THE SCRIBE AND PILED IN THE LITTLE ROOM
THOUGH I DIDN'T REALIZE IT THEN THIS WAS THE DUMA'S DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI
SACK DIRECTOR IN THIS COUNTRY OF THE RUSSIAN INFORMATION BUREAU WHICH OPPOSES THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT HAS THIS TO SAY IN HIS BOOK THE BIRTH OF THE RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY
FILLIPOVSKY IN THE CHAIR AND SKOBELIEV AGAIN IN THE TRIBUNE REPORTING TO IMMENSE APPLAUSE NEW ADHESIONS TO THE COMMITTEE
THE POLICY OF NEGOTIATIONS AND CONCESSIONS HAS BORNE ITS FRUITS
KAMENIEV NOW SPOKE DESCRIBING THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE
THE KORNILOVS KALEDINS DUTOVS KARAULOVS BARDIZHES ALL DEFEND WITH THEIR WHOLE SOULS THE INTERESTS OF THE RICH MEN AND THEY ARE READY TO DROWN RUSSIA IN BLOOD IF ONLY THE LANDS REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE LANDOWNERS
ALMOST THE SAME MOMENT WORD RAN FROM GROUP TO GROUP THAT THE BUILDING WAS SURROUNDED BY RED GUARDS
THE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES TO ALL THE GOVERNMENTS AND TO THE PEOPLES OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES TO CONCLUDE AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AT THE SAME TIME SUGGESTING THAT THE ARMISTICE OUGHT TO LAST THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH TIME IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO HOLD THE NECESSARY POURPARLERS BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE NATIONS AND NATIONALITIES WITHOUT EXCEPTION DRAWN INTO THE WAR OR FORCED TO TAKE PART IN IT BUT ALSO TO CONVOKE AUTHORISED ASSEMBLIES OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF ALL COUNTRIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE DEFINITE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE
ARREST OF SOME OF THE MINISTERS
NOW RAGED THE BATTLE OF THE PRINTING PRESS--ALL OTHER WEAPONS BEING IN THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS
THE SIX GIRLS SCURRIED BACKWARD AND FORWARD INSTRUCTING HELPING SCOLDING
HERE MILIUKOV WAS INTERRUPTED BY FURIOUS CRIES FROM THE LEFT DEMANDING WHAT SOCIALIST HAD EVER ADVISED SUCH ACTION
IN ALL THREE DIRECTIONS NOT A HUMAN BEING WAS IN SIGHT
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTROLLED BY THE PROPERTIED CLASSES CLAIMED AUTONOMY REFUSING TO OBEY ORDERS FROM PETROGRAD
ALL DECORATIONS ORDERS AND OTHER MARKS OF DISTINCTION ARE ABOLISHED
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER AS WE STOOD THERE IN A KIND OF AWKWARD HUSH SOME ONE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOUTED COMRADES
MILITARY AND CIVIL AUTHORITIES MUST RENDER EVERY ASSISTANCE IN ARMING THE WORKERS AND IN SUPPLYING THEM WITH TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF REQUISITIONING ARMS BELONGING TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT
YES HE CRIED
THEY ARE OPPOSED BY THE INCREDIBLE HOSTILITY OF ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY--AND YET THE GERMAN COMRADES TRY TO ACT
THERE IS NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE ANOTHER FOLLOWED HIM A SOLDIER WITH DISORDERED BEARD AND FLAMING EYES
A SMALL BOY HAD CLIMBED UP THE SIDE OF THE THING AND WAS LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A MACHINE GUN
THEY WORKED NOW STERNLY MANY OF THEM WITH EYES RED FROM WEEPING
IF THERE IS A CONGRESS HE SAID IT WILL REPRESENT THE OVERWHELMING SENTIMENT OF THE PEOPLE
I SHALL THEREFORE REMAIN AT MY POST
WHEN THIS WORK--WITH THE ENERGETIC ASSISTANCE OF THE DISTRICT SOVIETS AND THE FACTORIES THE PUTILOV WORKS OBUKHOV AND OTHERS)--WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE ISSUE OF THE EXPECTED ENCOUNTER LEFT NO PLACE FOR DOUBT
THE SECOND TO CUT OFF THE DUMA AND THE YUNKER SCHOOLS
BUT WE GOT A FEW AND THE GARRISON WAS ALL ON THE MARCH A RED GUARD FROM VASILI OSTROV DESCRIBED IN GREAT DETAIL WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN HIS DISTRICT ON THE GREAT DAY OF THE RISING
THE TSAY-EE-KAH UNITED IN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION WITH THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND THE PEASANTS CONGRESS CONFIRMS THE LAND AND PEACE DECREES ADOPTED BY THE SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES AND ALSO THE DECREE ON WORKERS CONTROL ADOPTED BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH THE JOINT SESSION OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND THE PEASANTS CONGRESS EXPRESSES ITS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THE UNION OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS THIS FRATERNAL UNION OF ALL THE WORKERS AND ALL EXPLOITED WILL CONSOLIDATE THE POWER CONQUERED BY THEM THAT IT WILL TAKE ALL REVOLUTIONARY MEASURES TO HASTEN THE PASSING OF THE POWER INTO THE HANDS OF THE WORKING-CLASS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THAT IT WILL ASSURE IN THIS MANNER THE LASTING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF A JUST PEACE AND THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM SEE APP
ALL THESE COMING AND GOING TRUDGED THROUGH THE WHITENED MUD THAT COVERED THE COBBLES OF THE HIGHWAY INCHES DEEP
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY HAD VOTED LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ITS OFFICERS
THE COSSACKS ARE COMING NO WHAT'S THE LATEST I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
OPPOSED THE BOLSHEVIK TACTICS BUT REMAINED IN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
IF THE MAJORITY IS BOLSHEVIK AS I THINK IT WILL BE WE SHALL DEMAND THAT THE POWER BE GIVEN TO THE SOVIETS AND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT MUST RESIGN VOLODARSKY A TALL PALE YOUTH WITH GLASSES AND A BAD COMPLEXION WAS MORE DEFINITE
NO MORE TALK
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE VARIOUS LOCAL SOVIETS ARE INVITED TO ENTER INTO DIRECT RELATIONS WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE 2
YESTERDAY WE SENT A TELEGRAM ALL OVER RUSSIA DEMANDING THAT WAR BETWEEN THE POLITICAL PARTIES CEASE AT ONCE AND INSISTING ON THE FORMATION OF A COALITION SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT
THE SOVIET EXPRESSES ITS CONVICTION THAT THE CITY WORKERS ALLIES OF THE POOR PEASANTS WILL ASSURE COMPLETE REVOLUTIONARY ORDER INDISPENSABLE TO THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM
THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IN MEETING IN SUCH UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY THE TSAY-EE-KAH CONSIDERS IT UNNECESSARY TO ADDRESS YOU WITH A POLITICAL SPEECH
BY CROWD VOTE IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED THAT ONLY REPRESENTATIVES OF POLITICAL FACTIONS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK ON THE MOTION AND THAT SPEAKERS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FIFTEEN MINUTES
DEEP STUBBORN BITTERNESS DIVIDED THE DELEGATES INTO ANGRY GROUPS
PEACE OR SUPPLIES
IT IS PARTICULARLY TERRIBLE IN THESE DAYS OF VIOLENT STRUGGLE OF DESTRUCTIVE WARFARE TO BE COMMISSAR OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
TO SUPPRESS ANY ARMED DEMONSTRATION OR RIOT AT ITS START WITH ALL ARMED FORCES AT HAND
THEY WANT TO STARVE US--OR DRIVE US TO VIOLENCE AMONG THE SOLDIERS ONE BEGAN COMRADES
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED DOWN
SO WAS THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION
2 APPENDIX TO CHAPTER I 1
THE WOMEN'S BATTALION IS IN THERE--THEY WILL SAY WE HAVE FIRED ON RUSSIAN WOMEN AS WE REACHED THE NEVSKY AGAIN ANOTHER ARMOURED CAR CAME AROUND THE CORNER AND A MAN POKED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE TURRET-TOP
THE ELECTION OF COMMANDING STAFF AND OFFICERS IS INTRODUCED
ALL THAT NIGHT THE COMMISSION WRANGLED AND ALL THE NEXT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT
WE CAME DOWN TO THE FRONT OF THE TWELFTH ARMY BACK OF RIGA WHERE GAUNT AND BOOTLESS MEN SICKENED IN THE MUD OF DESPERATE TRENCHES
SOME OF THE WORKERS BECAUSE THEY WERE POLITICALLY BACKWARD OTHERS BECAUSE THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY FOR THEM WAS IN THEIR UNNS
LENIN AND THE PETROGRAD WORKERS HAD DECIDED ON INSURRECTION THE PETROGRAD SOVIET HAD OVERTHROWN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THRUST THE COUP D'ETAT UPON THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
BEHIND US GREAT SMOLNY BRIGHT WITH LIGHTS HUMMED LIKE A GIGANTIC HIVE
THE ELECTIONS FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY SHALL TAKE PLACE AT THE DATE DETERMINED UPON--NOVEMBER 12
ON SEPTEMBER 1ST GENERAL ZANKIEVITCH SENT AN ULTIMATUM TO THE REBELS DEMANDING THAT THEY LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND MENACING IN CASE OF REFUSAL TO OPEN FIRE WITH ARTILLERY IF THE ORDER WAS NOT OBEYED BY SEPTEMBER 3D AT 10 O'CLOCK
REFUSAL OF INSURRECTION MEANS SURRENDER TO THE LIEBER-DANS EITHER WE MUST DROP ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS OR MAKE AN INSURRECTION
ANOTHER TO-MORROW

THE REBELS KEPT UP A HEAVY FIRE WITH THEIR MACHINE-GUNS
ALL THE PETROGRAD REGIMENTS MOVED OUT TO THE POSITIONS WITH TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM
ALL WHO RESIST THE EXECUTION OF THIS DECREE ARE DECLARED BY THE COMMITTEE TO BE TRAITORS TO THE REVOLUTION AND THEIR ORDERS ARE HEREWITH DECLARED NULL AND VOID THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES TO ALL PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
SUDDENLY BY COMMON IMPULSE WE FOUND OURSELVES ON OUR FEET MUMBLING TOGETHER INTO THE SMOOTH LIFTING UNISON OF THE INTERNATIONALE A GRIZZLED OLD SOLDIER WAS SOBBING LIKE A CHILD
AT ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM SAT A BALD-HEADED DISSIPATED-LOOKING LITTLE MAN IN A FROCK-COAT AND A RICH FUR COAT BITING HIS MOUSTACHE AND STARING AROUND HIM LIKE A CORNERED RAT
SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
WE ADDRESS OURSELVES TO THE GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS TO THE PEOPLES FOR A DECLARATION WHICH WOULD BE ADDRESSED ONLY TO THE PEOPLES OF THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES MIGHT DELAY THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE
ALL RUSSIA IS RALLYING TO US
IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE NOTHING BROKE THE FLAT MONOTONY BUT A FEW WALLED MONASTERIES AND CONVENTS SOME ISOLATED FACTORIES AND SEVERAL LARGE BUILDINGS WITH UNKEMPT GROUNDS THAT WERE ASYLUMS AND ORPHANAGES
THIS PROPOSAL OF PEACE WILL MEET WITH RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF THE IMPERIALIST GOVERNMENTS--WE DON'T FOOL OURSELVES ON THAT SCORE
I HAVE NO KEYS THE RED GUARD SNEERED KNOWINGLY
MR KERENSKY HE BEGAN IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE PEOPLE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE REVOLUTION YES I KNOW INTERRUPTED KERENSKY QUIZZICALLY

THE COSSACKS DELIBERATED FOR A WHILE
THE PRESS SHOULD BE FREE EXCEPT FOR APPEALS TO RIOT AND INSURRECTION IN A STORM OF HISSES AND HOOTS FROM HIS OWN PARTY LARIN OFFERED THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION
I RECOGNISED MELNICHANSKY WHOM I HAD KNOWN AS THE WATCH-MAKER GEORGE MELCHER IN BAYONNE NEW JERSEY DURING THE GREAT STANDARD OIL STRIKE
RIGA HAD BEEN SURRENDERED JUST AFTER GENERAL KORNILOV SAID PUBLICLY MUST WE PAY WITH RIGA THE PRICE OF BRINGING THE COUNTRY TO A SENSE OF ITS DUTY?"[3 3 SEE KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK BY JOHN REED
WE ARGUED EXPOSTULATED AND THE CONDUCTOR JOINED US--BUT THE SOLDIERS MERELY LAUGHED
IT WAS ALMOST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN AS WE LEFT THE HALL HOLTZMAN OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CAME RUNNING DOWN THE HALL WITH A TRANSFIGURED FACE
BUT THE GREAT IMPULSE OF THE MASSES THE GREAT HEROISM OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS IN MOSCOW PETROGRAD AT THE FRONT IN THE TRENCHES IN THE VILLAGES PUSHED ASIDE THE DESERTERS AS A RAILWAY TRAIN SCATTERS SAW-DUST
ALL THE LIVELONG AFTERNOON LENIN AND TROTZKY HAD FOUGHT AGAINST COMPROMISE
THEY HAVE BETRAYED RUSSIA ONE SPEAKER SAID
THE BOLSHEVIKI WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE
WE HAVEN'T GOT THE MEN
THEY HALTED AND THE CROWD PRESSED IN AND DELUGED THEM WITH QUESTIONS
I GIVE HERE ONLY EXTRACTS FROM TWO INSTALMENTS
HERE SAID THE COLONEL NERVOUSLY ARE THE KEYS TO THE DESK A RED GUARD INTERRUPTED
IT WOULD BE A DISGRACE ANY LONGER TO KEEP IN POVERTY THE TEACHERS OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE
TUMULT AND OVER THE STUBBORN OPPOSITION OF THE TRUCULENT LEFT THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC PASSED TO THE SIMPLE ORDER OF THE DAY
BUT THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WASN'T READY
WE DO NOT RECOGNISE THE LEGALITY OF THIS CONGRESS
MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
LET ALL WORKING-CLASS RUSSIA KNOW THAT THIS IS A LIE AND THAT ALL THE WORKING PEASANTS--IN THE PERSON OF--THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES--REFUTES WITH INDIGNATION ALL PARTICIPATION OF THE ORGANISED PEASANTRY IN THIS CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE WILL OF THE WORKING-CLASSES
AS WE LOOKED SUDDENLY AN ARMOURED AUTOMOBILE APPEARED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE MIKHAILOVSKY ITS GUNS SLUING THIS WAY AND THAT
TRUE THE BICYCLES WERE FOR THE USE OF ORDERLIES
THE NOBLE LENIN ONLY IMITATES THE NOBLE KEROYEVSKY WHEN HE HOLDS THAT FROM RUSSIA WILL COME THE NEW WORLD WHICH SHALL RESUSCITATE THE AGED WEST AND WHICH WILL REPLACE THE OLD BANNER OF DOCTRINARY SOCIALISM BY THE NEW DIRECT ACTION OF STARVING MASSES--AND THAT WILL PUSH HUMANITY FORWARD AND FORCE IT TO BREAK IN THE DOORS OF THE SOCIAL PARADISE THESE MEN SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT THE DECOMPOSITION OF RUSSIA WOULD BRING ABOUT THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WHOLE CAPITALIST REGIME

IN HIS FREE HAND HE CARRIED AS ALWAYS THE ENORMOUS BLUESTEEL REVOLVER
ON THE 29TH THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ORDERED THE DISSOLUTION AND RE-ELECTION OF THE PETROGRAD CITY DUMA
AFTER ALL HE SAID THEY REPRESENTED AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL PARTY
OBORONTSI_--"DEFENDERS ALL THE MODERATE SOCIALIST GROUPS ADOPTED OR WERE GIVEN THIS NAME BECAUSE THEY CONSENTED TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR UNDER ALLIED LEADERSHIP ON THE GROUND THAT IT WAS A WAR OF NATIONAL DEFENCE
NOW THAT THAT UNION IS BROUGHT ABOUT WE CONSIDER IT A SACRED DUTY TO TAKE OUR PLACES ONCE MORE IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH
AND THERE WERE THE UNIONS
THEREFORE IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO PRESERVE AT ANY PRICE THE MORALE OF THE TROOPS BY ASSURING COMPLETE ORDER AND THE PRESERVATION OF THE ARMY FROM NEW SHOCKS AND BY MAINTAINING ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THEIR SUBORDINATES
IF THE FIRST REVOLUTION HAD THE RIGHT TO SUPPRESS THE MONARCHIST PAPERS THEN WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUPPRESS THE BOURGEOIS PRESS
IT WAS LATE IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION WAS PUT AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
DOWN WITH THE GOVERNMENT
BUT THERE IS A WHOLE SERIES OF POPULAR DEMANDS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED NO SATISFACTION UP TO NOW
THE RUSSIAN WORKING PEOPLE ARE FOR THE MOST PART ABLE TO READ AND WRITE
SHOOTING DOWN YOUR RUSSIAN BROTHERS ON THE STREETS WHEN DID WE DO THAT ASKED A WORKER
| +------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+ IN SPITE OF NUMEROUS STORIES OF GIGANTIC ADVANCES IN WAGES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REVOLUTION OF MARCH 1917 THESE FIGURES WHICH WERE PUBLISHED BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR AS CHARACTERISTIC OF CONDITIONS ALL OVER RUSSIA SHOW THAT WAGES DID NOT RISE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REVOLUTION BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE
A STOUT WOMAN WITH A HAMMER IN HER HAND AND HER MOUTH FULL OF TACKS CAME OUT
PROVOCATORS AND REACTIONARIES RAISED THE CRY THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE GERMAN AGENTS UNTIL PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD BELIEVED IT
AND THESE NEWSPAPERS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS FREELY CIRCULATED AMONG THE SOLDIER MASSES AND BEGAN A BOLSHEVIK PROPAGANDA OFTEN SPREADING FALSE NEWS WHICH APPEARED IN THE FRENCH JOURNALS
MEETINGS IN THE TRENCHES AT THE FRONT IN VILLAGE SQUARES FACTORIES
BUT WORST OF ALL SAID MELNICHANSKY WE HAD TO ORGANISE WHILE WE WERE FIGHTING
BLOWS ARE BEING STRUCK AGAINST THE WINTER PALACE AND IT IS BY SUCH BLOWS THAT THE NAILS ARE BEING DRIVEN INTO THE COFFIN OF THE POLITICAL PARTY WHICH HAS RISKED SUCH AN ADVENTURE UPROAR

ON DECEMBER 3D THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS RESOLVED TO REDUCE THE SALARIES OF FUNCTIONARIES AND EMPLOYEES IN ALL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND ESTABLISHMENTS GENERAL OR SPECIAL WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO BEGIN WITH THE COUNCIL FIXED THE SALARY OF A PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR AT 500 RUBLES PER MONTH WITH 100 RUBLES ADDITIONAL FOR EACH GROWN MEMBER OF THE FAMILY INCAPABLE OF WORK
WE HAD NO KEROSENE SO OUR LIGHTS WERE NOT BURNING
A PEASANT TOLD OF THE DISORDERS IN TVER WHICH HE SAID WERE CAUSED BY THE ARREST OF THE LAND COMMITTEES
HIS FACE A LITTLE PALER THAN USUAL HE PASSED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE ROOM SURROUNDED BY EAGER FRIENDS AND HURRIED OUT TO THE WAITING AUTOMOBILE
AND SO IT FOLLOWED THAT WHEN THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS WERE FORCED TO ASSUME THE POWER THEY WERE AFRAID TO USE IT
THE ANSWER TO THIS PROPOSAL MUST BE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF OUR ENVOYS BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING
WHAT DO THE SOLDIERS SAY ABOUT IT JEERS AND HOOTS
A GREAT MANY OF THEM WERE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
BUT NO ONE BELIEVES HIM
NOTHING ELSE COULD GUARANTEE THE REVOLUTION AGAINST ITS ENEMIES WHO WERE DELIBERATELY RUINING THE COUNTRY RUINING THE ARMY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR A NEW KONILOV
WORKMEN TO HAVE FULL REPRESENTATION IN THE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY
ANTONOV AND WILLIAMS MADE SPEECHES TO THE VICTORIOUS SAILORS INFLAMED BY THEIR MANY DEAD--AND ONCE MORE THE YUNKERS WENT FREE
ARREST THEM ANOTHER WHO ARE THESE PIANIKHS THESE AVKSENTIEVS
MEANWHILE AT MOGHILEV WERE GATHERED THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH THE MODERATE SOCIALIST LEADERS--FROM AVKSENTIEV TO TCHERNOV--THE ACTIVE CHIEFS OF THE OLD ARMY COMMITTEES AND THE REACTIONARY OFFICERS
THERE WAS FOOD FOR THREE DAYS ONLY IN PETROGRAD AND NO MORE COMING IN
STRENGTHEN THEM ESTABLISH A SEVERE REVOLUTIONARY CONTROL PITILESSLY CRUSH THE ATTEMPTS AT ANARCHY ON THE PART OF DRUNKARDS BRIGANDS COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY YUNKERS AND KORNILOVISTS
COUNTING UPON YOUR LACK OF INFORMATION COMRADES WORKERS AND SOLDIERS IN QUESTIONS OF FINANCE AND BANKING YOU ARE BEING INCITED AGAINST WORKERS LIKE YOURSELVES BECAUSE IT IS DESIRABLE TO DIVERT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE STARVING AND DYING BROTHER-SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT FROM THE GUILTY PERSONS TO THE INNOCENT WORKERS WHO ARE ACCOMPLISHING THEIR DUTY UNDER THE BURDEN OF GENERAL POVERTY AND DISORGANISATION
A JOURNALIST CAME RUNNING INTO THE ROOM WAVING A PAPER
THEY SPECULATE ON IT THEY WORK UPON IT BY A DEMAGOGY WHICH NOTHING CAN STOP
AND IF THE BOLSHEVIKI PROVOKE AN INSURRECTION AGAINST THE LEGAL POWER AND THUS FACILITATE THE GERMAN INVASION THEY MUST BE TREATED AS MUTINEERS AND TRAITORS BIRZHEVYA VIEDOMOSTI OCTOBER 28
NO INFANTRY DETACHMENT CONSENTS TO MARCH AGAINST THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT WHICH IN ACCORD WITH THE FIRM WILL OF THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE HAS BEGUN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND HAS GIVEN THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS

WHO IS WHISTLING HERE THE CLAQUE RUDELY BURST ASUNDER WENT FLYING--NOR DID IT GATHER AGAIN
THE NEW WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT WILL PROPOSE IMMEDIATELY A JUST AND DEMOCRATIC PEACE TO ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES
SEVERAL SOLDIERS JUST ARRIVED FROM THE FRONT BROUGHT THE ENTHUSIASTIC GREETINGS OF THEIR REGIMENTS
WE ELECTED BY 183,000 VOTES CONSIDER IT OUR DUTY TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE DUMA AND DECLARE THAT WE DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERRIBLE BUT INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES

1 BACK AGAINST THE WALL THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE STRUCK--FOR ITS LIFE
BESIDE MY DOOR WHEN I CAME DOWN IN THE MORNING WERE POSTED TWO NEW ORDERS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DIRECTING THAT ALL SHOPS AND STORES SHOULD OPEN AS USUAL AND THAT ALL EMPTY ROOMS AND APARTMENTS SHOULD BE PUT AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE COMMITTEE
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS TEMPORARILY TRANSFERRED THIS POWER BOTH TO ITS EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND TO THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
AND WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKI COMPELLED BY THE DESPERATE NEEDS OF THE CITY POPULATION ATTEMPTED TO HELP OR TO CONTROL THE PUBLIC SERVICE ALL THE EMPLOYEES WENT ON STRIKE IMMEDIATELY AND THE DUMA FLOODED RUSSIA WITH TELEGRAMS ABOUT BOLSHEVIK VIOLATION OF MUNICIPAL AUTONOMY AT MILITARY HEADQUARTERS AND IN THE OFFICES OF THE MINISTRIES OF WAR AND MARINE WHERE THE OLD OFFICIALS HAD CONSENTED TO WORK THE ARMY COMMITTEES AND THE HIGH COMMAND BLOCKED THE SOVIETS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF NEGLECTING THE TROOPS AT THE FRONT
THE FIRST IS THAT KERENSKY KNEW ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF SEVERAL DETACHMENTS FROM THE FRONT TOWARD PETROGRAD AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AS PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER OF WAR REALISING THE GROWING BOLSHEVIST DANGER HE CALLED FOR THEM THE ONLY FLAW IN THAT ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE WAS NO BOLSHEVIST DANGER AT THAT TIME THE BOLSHEVIKI STILL BEING A POWERLESS MINORITY IN THE SOVIETS AND THEIR LEADERS IN JAIL OR HIDING

THE CONGRESS WISHES ALSO TO WELCOME INTO ITS MIDST THE WORKER-COSSACKS
YOU CALL US DEFEATISTS
THE TIME MAY COME WHEN DAN WILL SAY THAT THE FLOWER OF THE REVOLUTION PARTICIPATED IN THE RISING OF JULY 16TH AND 18TH
TO US THE REVOLUTION IS A GREAT FAILURE
AN ARTICLE IN RABOTCHI PUT WORKERS WAY ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER ENTITLED THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS EXPRESSED THE FEELING OF THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS
TO AVOID ALL MISUNDERSTANDING I MUST SAY FRANKLY THAT RUSSIA MUST PRESENT AT THE PARIS CONFERENCE ONE POINT OF VIEW HE DID NOT WANT TO COMMENT ON THE NAKAZ TO SKOBELIEV BUT HE REFERRED TO THE MANIFESTO OF THE DUTCH-SCANDINAVIAN COMMITTEE JUST PUBLISHED IN STOCKHOLM
THE MARCH REVOLUTION HAD MERELY HASTENED IT AND GIVING BIRTH TO A SORT OF FORECAST OF THE NEW ORDER HAD ENDED BY MERELY PERPETUATING THE HOLLOW STRUCTURE OF THE OLD REGIME
IN EVENT OF THE LEAST RESISTANCE OR OPPOSITION ON THEIR PART THE HARSHNESS OF THE MEASURES WHICH WILL BE ADOPTED AGAINST THEM WILL CORRESPOND TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR CRIME
AFTER JULY 16TH AND 18TH THEY DIDN'T USE MUCH CEREMONY WITH US WITH A TRIUMPHANT RING IN HIS VOICE HE CRIED NOW THAT THE OBORONTSI AND THE FAINT-HEARTED HAVE GONE AND THE WHOLE TASK OF DEFENDING AND SAVING THE REVOLUTION RESTS ON OUR SHOULDERS IT IS PARTICULARLY NECESSARY TO WORK--WORK--WORK
THERE WERE BAYONETS AT THE EDGES OF THE ROOM BAYONETS PRICKING UP AMONG THE DELEGATES
EVEN THE VOTING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DO AWAY WITH HUNGER OR BEAT WILHELM
ON NOVEMBER 1ST TWO PROCLAMATIONS WERE ISSUED
THE CAMPAIGN OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS IS BEING DIRECTED AGAINST THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS ON THE EVE OF ITS OPENING AGAINST THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AGAINST THE PEOPLE
DO NOT TRUST THE PROMISES OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
SHOULD WE COME OUT OR NOT
EVEN THE CITY DUMA HAD BEEN DISSOLVED
MARTOV DEMANDING THE FLOOR CROAKED HOARSELY THE CIVIL WAR IS BEGINNING COMRADES
THEY LOOKED AT US WITH ASTONISHMENT AS WE MARCHED PAST THROUGH ROOM AFTER ROOM UNTIL AT LAST WE CAME OUT INTO A SERIES OF GREAT STATE-SALONS FRONTING THEIR LONG AND DIRTY WINDOWS ON THE SQUARE
GO AWAY WE TRIED TO ENGAGE THE SOLDIER AND SAILOR IN CONVERSATION BUT THEY SEEMED FRIGHTENED AND UNHAPPY AND DREW OFF INTO THE DARKNESS

NOT BY CONCILIATING THE OLD GOVERNMENT MECHANISM DID THE BOLSHEVIKI CONQUER THE POWER
THEIR MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DOESN'T DARE TO SEND A COMMISSAR INTO THIS BUILDING
IS THAT THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
YOU SEE I AM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE
THE MOMENT IS DECISIVE
56 PASS TO THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALIST PRESS JOHN REED TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF CONFINEMENT IN THE CITIES OF PETROGRAD AND CRONSTADT FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENERALLY INVESTIGATING THE CONDITION OF THE PRISONERS AND FOR THOROUGH SOCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF STOPPING THE FLOOD OF NEWSPAPER LIES AGAINST DEMORCRACY
RESOLUTION TO INFORM THE DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS OF ALL RUSSIA BY TELEGRAPH
WHEN FORCED TO ACT IT ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE INTERESTS OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
THE BENCHES ALONG THE WOODEN TABLES WERE PACKED WITH HUNGRY PROLETARIANS WOLFING THEIR FOOD PLOTTING SHOUTING ROUGH JOKES ACROSS THE ROOM
IN THE LONG BREAD LINES WHICH AS FORMERLY STOOD IN THE IRON WINTER STREETS IT WAS NOT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS BLAMED AS IT HAD BEEN UNDER KERENSKY BUT THE TCHINOVNIKI THE SABOTAGEURS
THE COOPERATION OF THE PEDAGOGUES WITH THE SOCIAL FORCES--THIS IS HOW THE COMMISSION WILL WORK BOTH IN ITS OWN CONSTITUTION IN THE STATE COMMITTEE AND IN ALL ITS ACTIVITIES
TSARSKOYE SELO HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS
WHITE GUARDS BOURGEOIS VOLUNTEERS WHO EMERGED IN THE LAST STAGES OF THE REVOLUTION TO DEFEND PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM THE BOLSHEVIK ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH IT
IF HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO UTILISE THE SHORT PERIOD IT IS EXPECTED TO LIVE--TWENTY-FOUR FORTY-EIGHT OR SEVENTY-TWO HOURS--TO ATTACK US THEN WE SHALL ANSWER WITH COUNTER-ATTACKS BLOW FOR BLOW STEEL FOR IRON AMID CHEERS HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAD AGREED TO SEND REPRESENTATIVES INTO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
WE ARE STARVING AT THE FRONT WE ARE STIFF WITH COLD
| 400.-455
THE PASSING OF THE POWER INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS WILL BRING ABOUT A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE AND THIS TRANSFORMATION WILL NECESSARILY BE EVIDENT IN THE PRESS
IT IS WITH THE MAJORITY OF PEASANTS AND WORKERS AGAINST THE LANDOWNERS AND AGAINST THE CAPITALISTS
AT HOME IN HIS VILLAGE THE LANDLORDS WERE DEFYING HIS LAND COMMITTEES JAILING HIS COMRADES
THE CENTRAL LAND COMMITTEE HAD APPEALED TO THE PEASANTS ORDERING THEM NOT TO RECOGNISE THE LAND DECREE PASSED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE SOVIETS BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE CONFUSION AND CIVIL WAR
ALONE OF THE INTELLECTUALS LENIN AND TROTZKY STOOD FOR INSURRECTION
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV 1
WE MUST ABSOLUTELY SHOW THAT WE'RE CONDUCTING AN ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY
I GAVE THE ALARM AND ORDERED THAT HE BE SEARCHED FOR SUPPOSING THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE LEFT GATCHINA BUT HE COULD NOT BE FOUND AND SO KERENSKY FLED ALONE DISGUISED IN THE UNIFORM OF A SAILOR AND BY THAT ACT LOST WHATEVER POPULARITY HE HAD RETAINED AMONG THE RUSSIAN MASSES
HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT
LEAVING THIS COUNCIL WE APPEAL TO THE MANHOOD AND WISDOM OF THE WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS OF ALL RUSSIA
KHANJUNOV TRIED TO SPEAK AGAIN BUT VOTE
ONLY A FEDERATED REPUBLIC OF EUROPE CAN GIVE PEACE TO THE WORLD HE SMILED--THAT FINE FAINTLY IRONICAL SMILE OF HIS
REVOLUTION HE SAID IS A SICKNESS
WE DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL FROM THE RANKS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE SOCIALIST THE POLITICAL ADVENTURER--KERENSKY AS ONE WHO IS SCANDALISING AND RUINING THE GREAT REVOLUTION AND WITH IT THE REVOLUTIONARY MASSES BY HIS SHAMELESS POLITICAL BLACKMAIL ON BEHALF OF THE BOURGEOISIE
AND THEN--DEATH TO THE REVOLUTION DEATH TO OUR LIBERTY
IN SPECIAL MATTERS CONCERNING THEIR PECULIAR INTERESTS HOWEVER THE WORKERS AND THE SOLDIERS SECTIONS CONTINUED TO MEET SEPARATELY

ALL IS EMPTY AND SILENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
BUT NOW IN NOVEMBER THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ARE STILL HOLDING OUT THEIR HAND TO AVKSENTIEV WHO IS PULLING THE PEOPLE WITH HIS LITTLE FINGER
IN A GRACEFUL WHITE GEORGIAN ROOM DIVIDED INTO UNEQUAL PARTS BY A TWO-SIDED FIRE-PLACE A GROUP OF OFFICERS STOOD ANXIOUSLY TALKING
A GREAT SOLDIER MEETING WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 24TH ADDRESSED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES
THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 30TH TO 31ST WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY
THE NAKAZ TO SKOBELIEV RESUME PASSED BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND GIVEN TO SKOBELIEV AS AN INSTRUCTION FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY AT THE PARIS CONFERENCE THE PEACE TREATY MUST BE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE NO ANNEXATIONS NO INDEMNITIES THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES TERRITORIAL PROBLEMS 1 EVACUATION OF GERMAN TROOPS FROM INVADED RUSSIA
I STAND WITH TCHERNOV WHO IS A REAL REVOLUTIONIST
POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS SPIRO
ONE REGIMENT IS ON THE MARCH TO CAPTURE THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE ANOTHER THE TELEGRAPH AGENCY ANOTHER THE STATE BANK
THROUGH THE RED ARCH APPEARED THE YUNKERS MARCHING A LITTLE OUT OF STEP ONE OF THEM SUPPORTED BY TWO COMRADES
NOW THE PALACE WHERE THE SOVIET HAD MET WAS A BUSY PLACE
THE CONQUEST OF POWER
OUR DUTY SAID THE DIELO NARODA IS TO UNMASK THESE TRAITORS TO THE WORKING-CLASS
ALL REMEMBER THE DAYS OF MAY WHEN THE FRATERNISATION ON OUR FRONT THREATENED TO END THE WAR BY A SIMPLE CESSATION OF MILITARY OPERATIONS AND LEAD THE COUNTRY TO A SHAMEFUL SEPARATE PEACE
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE PROPOSES TO ALL PUBLIC ORGANISATIONS TO ALL HONEST CITIZENS
WELL I TELL YOU THAT THESE PASSES ARE SIGNED WITH THE SAME NAMES THAT ARE SIGNED TO MY PASS HE LED US DOWN THROUGH THE PALACE AND OUT THROUGH A DOOR OPENING ONTO THE NEVA QUAY BEFORE WHICH STOOD THE USUAL COMMITTEE GOING THROUGH POCKETS
FROM THIS MOMENT ALL POWER BELONGS TO THE SOVIETS
IN MOSCOW WE WOULD GET THE TRUE FEELING OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE REVOLUTION
THE KORNILOV REVOLT IS TREATED IN DETAIL IN MY FORTHCOMING VOLUME KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KERENSKY FOR THE SITUATION WHICH GAVE RISE TO KORNILOV'S ATTEMPT IS NOW PRETTY CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
AT THE END OF THIS WAR I SEE EUROPE RECREATED NOT BY THE DIPLOMATS BUT BY THE PROLETARIAT
THESE ONCE-POWERFUL FACTIONS NO LONGER EXISTED OPENLY
CIVIL WAR BEGUN BY THE BOLSHEVIKI THREATENS TO DELIVER THE COUNTRY TO THE HORRORS OF ANARCHY AND COUNTER-REVOLUTION AND CAUSE THE FAILURE OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WHICH MUST AFFIRM THE REPUBLICAN REGIME AND TRANSMIT TO THE PEOPLE FOREVER THEIR RIGHT TO THE LAND
GENERAL HE SAID TO ME YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME
THE CORRIDORS WERE FULL OF HURRYING MEN HOLLOW-EYED AND DIRTY
THEY WERE ALSO REPRESENTED IN THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
ALL THE CAPITALISTS LANDOWNERS GENERALS-KORNILOVISTS HAVE RISEN AGAINST THE PEACEFUL POLICY OF THE SOVIETS
EDUCATION PROCLAMATION PROCLAMATION OF THE COMMISSION OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CITY DUMA CONCERNING THE STRIKE OF SCHOOL-TEACHERS JUST BEFORE THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS
WE MUST DO HONOUR TO A POLITICAL PARTY WHICH PUTS SUCH AN ACT INTO EFFECT THE FIRST DAY WITHOUT JAWING ABOUT IT A TYPICAL PEASANT WAS IN THE TRIBUNE LONG HAIR BOOTS AND SHEEP-SKIN COAT BOWING TO ALL CORNERS OF THE HALL
LOOKING BACK RUSSIA BEFORE THE NOVEMBER INSURRECTION SEEMS OF ANOTHER AGE ALMOST INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE
WHAT DO YOU WANT SHE ASKED
THE EARLY TWILIGHT OF WINTER WAS FALLING
COSSACKS WERE SENT TO KEEP ORDER IN THE PROVINCES
THEY THE WORKING PEOPLE SAW IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT EVEN UNDER A FREE GOVERNMENT IF IT FELL INTO THE HANDS OF OTHER SOCIAL CLASSES THEY MIGHT STILL CONTINUE TO STARVE
WHEN WE SMASH THE BOLSHEVIKI WE SHALL TURN AGAINST THE CADETS WILL THE BOLSHEVIKI BE ADMITTED INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
THE CITY WAS QUIET--PROBABLY NEVER SO QUIET IN ITS HISTORY
THE YUNKERS HAVE SENT WORD THEY WANT US TO GO AND GET THEM OUT VOICES BEGAN TO GIVE COMMANDS AND IN THE THICK GLOOM WE MADE OUT A DARK MASS MOVING FORWARD SILENT BUT FOR THE SHUFFLE OF FEET AND THE CLINKING OF ARMS
SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN MOSCOW IN THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER 1917 NOVAYA ZHIZN PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE TABLE OF ELECTION RESULTS POINTING OUT THAT THIS MEANT THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE POLICY OF COALITION WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
WE WANT A JUST PEACE BUT WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF A REVOLUTIONARY WAR
THE QUESTION OF FINANCES
HE IS KERENSKY'S MAN I TELL YOU
WRITE URITZKY HE SAYS WITH SEVERITY
UNTIL DAWN KERENSKY REMAINED AT THE PETROGRAD STAFF HEADQUARTERS SENDING ORDERS TO THE COSSACKS AND TO THE YUNKERS IN THE OFFICERS SCHOOLS IN AND AROUND PETROGRAD--ALL OF WHOM ANSWERED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO MOVE
EVERY MOVE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT APPARATUS WAS RESISTED
ONE EVENING I SPENT AT THE HOUSE OF A MOSCOW MERCHANT
DOWN-TOWN--ALL OVER--EVERYWHERE ANSWERED A LITTLE WORKMAN GRINNING WITH A LARGE EXULTANT GESTURE
HERE WE HAVE HAD OUR DINNER
THE DIRECTION OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS
THE ORGANISATION OF THE EMIGRATION ALSO THE COSTS THEREOF AND THE PROVIDING OF EMIGRANTS WITH THE NECESSARY MACHINERY AND LIVE-STOCK SHALL BE THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE
AT DAWN THE MILITARY HOTEL AND THE TELEGRAPH AGENCY HAD BEEN TAKEN BY LARGE FORCES OF YUNKERS AND BLOODILY RECAPTURED
ON ACCOUNT OF THIS DANGER OUR FREEDOM AND OUR REVOLUTION ARE PASSING THROUGH DIFFICULT DAYS
WE ARE PUTTING THEM IN THE PILLORY
TOWARD NIGHTFALL HE ARRIVED AT THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN AND WENT ON AFOOT
IN PETROGRAD THE ECONOMIC COUNCIL ESTABLISHED TO REBUILD THE SHATTERED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE COUNTRY CAME TO A DEADLOCK BETWEEN THE OPPOSING FORCES OF CAPITAL AND LABOUR AND WAS DISSOLVED BY KERENSKY
TOWARD EVENING SOME OFFICERS DISCOVERED THEIR PRESENCE AND THEY WERE ARRESTED AND BROUGHT BEFORE GENERAL KRASNOV WHO SAID YOU FOUGHT AGAINST KORNILOV
ON THE OTHER HAND WAS THE SHAPELESS WILL OF THE PROLETARIAT--THE WORKMEN COMMON SOLDIERS AND POOR PEASANTS
A COSSACK IS ON SERVICE HIS FARM IS GOING TO RACK AND RUIN
FIRST KARELIN FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
THE COLONEL CLEARED HIS THROAT
TSENTROFLOT CENTRE-FLEET"--THE CENTRAL FLEET COMMITTEE
THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY HAD VOTED TO EXPEL ALL MEMBERS WHO HAD REMAINED IN THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND ALL WHO WERE TAKING PART IN THE INSURRECTION
HUNDREDS OF PROPAGANDISTS WERE SENT TO THE DON
THREE CADETS STOOD BY US AND WE FELL INTO CONVERSATION
ON THE QUESTION OF AN AGREEMENT TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL WORKERS AND ALL SOLDIERS
| 8.50 | | CABINET-MAKER | | | | +------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+ | TERRASSIER | 1.30--1.50 | 3
NO ONE WILL BE DEPRIVED OF HIS PROPERTY WITHOUT A SPECIAL LAW ON THE NATIONALISATION OF BANKS AND FINANCIAL SYNDICATES
THE MEN WERE SUSPICIOUS SO THEY STOPPED THE TRAIN AT GATCHINA AND SENT A DELEGATION TO US
WHO ARE YOU I ASKED
AS FOR PEACE THAT WILL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT
OF THAT WE CANNOT BE SURE
RUSSIA HAS NOW THE RIGHT TO DEMAND OF THE ALLIES THAT THEY BRING GREATER FORCE OF ARMS TO BEAR HE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND STARED AT HIS INTERLOCUTOR
IN ACTION HIS ORDERS MUST BE OBEYED BUT HE IS STRICTLY RESPONSIBLE TO US
WE DEMAND THAT KERENSKY BE ARRESTED AND THAT HE BE ORDERED IN THE NAME OF THE ORGANISATIONS HEREINAFTER MENTIONED TO COME IMMEDIATELY TO PETROGRAD AND PRESENT HIMSELF TO THE TRIBUNAL
THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS IS NOT DEMOCRATIC POWER BUT A DICTATORSHIP--AND NOT THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT BUT AGAINST THE PROLETARIAT
TROTZKY PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR
THE DUMA TAKES NO PART IN THE PRESENT STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PARTIES
A GREAT DANGER THREATENS ALL THE CONQUESTS AND HOPES OF THE SOLDIERS AND WORKERS
SOME TEN OR TWELVE WERE TO WORK THE BARRACKS AND PERSUADE THE SOLDIERS TO REMAIN NEUTRAL--"RUSSIAN SOLDIERS DO NOT SHED THE BLOOD OF YOUR BROTHERS
ALREADY YOU ARE ISOLATED AND YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A SINGLE OTHER DEMOCRATIC GROUP
WAS IT TRUE THAT THE ARMY WAS MARCHING ON PETROGRAD
SIGNS WERE POSTED UP EVERYWHERE
THE SOLUTION IS FAITH IN THE ALLIES AND IN TERESTCHENKO
OTHERS WERE COVERED WITH GILDED OR SILVERED CLOTH OR HAD A SOLDIER'S HAT NAILED ON THE TOP
POPULIST SOCIALISTS OR TRUDOVIKI LABOUR GROUP NUMERICALLY A SMALL PARTY COMPOSED OF CAUTIOUS INTELLECTUALS THE LEADERS OF THE COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND CONSERVATIVE PEASANTS
AND WHEN THE OFFICERS SUDDENLY DESERTED US WE HAD NO BATTLE-STAFF TO GIVE ORDERS VIVID LITTLE PICTURES HE GAVE ME
FOR THE PRESIDENT FOR THE SECRETARY AT THE RAILROAD STATION NOBODY KNEW JUST WHERE KERENSKY WAS OR WHERE THE FRONT LAY
HAS THE GROUND CULTIVATED BY THE PEASANTS BEEN AUGMENTED
THE STATION AT MOSCOW WAS DESERTED
CHIEFS OF STAFF MUST BE CHOSEN FROM AMONG PERSONS WITH SPECIAL MILITARY TRAINING FOR THAT POST
THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION THE VARIOUS CENTRAL COMMITTEES SENT WORD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY EXHORTING THE POPULATION TO IGNORE THE GOVERNMENT DECREES
BUT YOU MUST GIVE ME A GUARD ON WHICH I CAN COUNT GOOD I WENT OUT AND CALLED THE COSSACK RUSSKOV OF THE TENTH REGIMENT OF THE DON AND ORDERED HIM TO PICK OUT TEN COSSACKS TO ACCOMPANY THE SUPREME COMMANDER
HOW CAN WE SHOOT AT THEM
THE MEETINGS OF THE PEASANTS EXECUTIVE BROKE UP IN STORMY WRANGLING
I WENT UP TO THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONIST KORNILOVITZ WHO SAT IN THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR
VASHE VUISOKOPREVOSKHODITELSTVO_--YOUR HIGH EXCELLENCY HE STAMMERED IN THE MANNER OF THE OLD REGIME ACCESS TO THE PALACE IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN--I HAVE NO RIGHT AN AUTOMOBILE CAME BY AND I SAW GOTZ SITTING INSIDE LAUGHING APPARENTLY WITH GREAT AMUSEMENT
FIRST 500 MEN WENT OUT OF WHOM 22 WERE ARRESTED
THE COSSACKS ASSUMED THE OFFENSIVE
WE DO NOT CARRY TROOPS FOR EITHER SIDE
JUST AT THE DOOR OF THE STATION STOOD TWO SOLDIERS WITH RIFLES AND BAYONETS FIXED
TO BREAK THE ARMY COMMITTEES AT THE FRONT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT WAS RESTORED AND MILITARY DEFEAT CONNIVED AT
IT WAS A PARTICULARLY ACTIVE SEASON FOR THEOSOPHISTS
THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED YET BUT IT IS LARGER ON THE PART OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS WHO EXPERIENCED GREAT LOSSES THROUGH ONE OF OUR ARMOURED CARS
IN THE NAME OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TROTZKY HAD DECLARED THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT NO LONGER EXISTED
HERE AND THERE STOOD RED GUARDS AND SAILORS WITH BAYONETTED RIFLES EACH ONE SURROUNDED BY ABOUT A HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN--CLERKS STUDENTS SHOPKEEPERS TCHINOVNIKI_--SHAKING THEIR FISTS AND BAWLING INSULTS AND MENACES
TCHERNOV WAS MENTIONED AS THE NEW PREMIER
THE FACT IS THAT THE TSAY-EE-KAH NO LONGER REPRESENTED THE RANK AND FILE OF THE SOVIETS AND HAD ILLEGALLY REFUSED TO CALL ANOTHER ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DUE IN SEPTEMBER
ORGANISE AROUND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE DEFENCE OF ITS TEMPORARY AUTHORITY IN THE NAME OF ORDER AND THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PEOPLES PROCLAMATION OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
HE THREW A BOMBSHELL
WE INVITE THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES TO ENTER THAT COALITION INSISTING HOWEVER THAT THEY CEASE LOOKING BACKWARD AND THAT THEY BREAK WITH THE CONCILIATORS OF THEIR PARTY
A COMMISSAR FROM SMOLNY NAMED KIRILOV TRIED TO HALT IT
FOR INSTANCE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HAD PROMISED TO PUBLISH THE SECRET TREATIES
ALL WAS QUIET THERE HE SAID
THERE WERE NO LIGHTS NO TELEPHONES
WE CANNOT DENY THAT THESE ORGANISATIONS ARE FIRMLY UNITED WITH THE MASSES WHOSE EVERYDAY NEEDS ARE BETTER SERVED BY THEM
PASSES WERE GIVEN OUT AND THE PASS SYSTEM WAS CHANGED EVERY FEW HOURS
KERENSKY ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS AND WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
IN THE MEANWHILE ONE MEMBER ARRIVED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT HE HAD TELEPHONED TO SMOLNY AND THAT THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SAID THAT NO ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN TO SURROUND THE DUMA THAT THE TROOPS WOULD BE WITHDRAWN
COLOURLESS HUMOURLESS UNCOMPROMISING AND DETACHED WITHOUT PICTURESQUE IDIOSYNCRASIES--BUT WITH THE POWER OF EXPLAINING PROFOUND IDEAS IN SIMPLE TERMS OF ANALYSING A CONCRETE SITUATION
THESE WERE THE MEN OF THE HOUR--AND OF OTHER HOURS TO COME
UPSTAIRS IN THE GREAT HALL A THOUSAND PEOPLE CROWDED TO THE UPROARIOUS SESSIONS OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
THE VIKZHEL WAS HOSTILE REFUSING TO TRANSPORT SOVIET TROOPS
IN THE DARK GLOOMY CORRIDOR STRIPPED OF ITS TAPESTRIES A FEW OLD ATTENDANTS WERE LOUNGING ABOUT AND IN FRONT OF KERENSKY'S DOOR A YOUNG OFFICER PACED UP AND DOWN GNAWING HIS MOUSTACHE
TERESTCHENKO'S SPEECH RESUME
THE STATE POWER HAS PASSED INTO THE HANDS OF THE ORGAN OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHICH STANDS AT THE HEAD OF THE PETROGRAD PROLETARIAT AND GARRISON
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
OUR STAFF WILL BE READY TO CONCLUDE AN ARMISTICE WHEN THE ENEMY CAN NO LONGER DO ANY HARM
CAPTAIN KHERLOV THERE IS A CADET
THE CANVAS COVERS HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF THE FOUR RAPID-FIRE GUNS ON EACH SIDE OF THE DOORWAY AND THE AMMUNITION-BELTS HUNG SNAKELIKE FROM THEIR BREECHES
THE EASE WITH WHICH THE COALITION GOVERNMENT WAS UPSET CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE LEFT WING OF THE DEMOCRACY BUT ONLY BY THE INCAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE PEACE AND BREAD
WE CANNOT SUSTAIN ANY GOVERNMENT EXCEPT A GOVERNMENT OF SOCIALIST COALITION
A COALITION WITH THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT OF TREASON TO THE PEOPLE
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS ARE PREPARING TO LEAVE AND THAT COMMITTEES FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION ARE FORMING IN ALL THE CITIES OF RUSSIA
THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IS WITH US
ONLY THE ESSENCE OF THEIR PROGRAMMES AND THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THEIR CONSTITUENCIES CAN BE NOTICED
TO ALL WORKERS AND SOLDIERS READ AND HAND TO OTHERS COMRADES WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OUR COUNTRY IS IN DANGER
THIS MACHINE BELONGS TO THE FIRST MACHINE-GUN REGIMENT AND WE'RE CARRYING AMMUNITION IN IT AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT THE DIFFICULTY HOWEVER WAS SOLVED BY THE APPEARANCE OF AN OLD BATTERED TAXI-CAB FLYING THE ITALIAN FLAG
THEN WHY SHOULD WE PLAY EVERYTHING ON ONE CARD ANSWER
A FRENCH OFFICER IN THE COURT-YARD SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND
THE COMMANDERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS NOT TO ENTER INTO ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE MUTINOUS GENERALS TO ACT DECISIVELY AND MERCILESSLY
THE REST OF THE GARRISON WAS EITHER BUSY SUPPRESSING THE YUNKER REVOLT GUARDING THE CITY OR UNDECIDED WHAT TO DO
NAMES DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO ME BUT I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WELL REPLIED THE SOLDIER IF YOU'RE AS IMPORTANT A FELLOW AS THAT YOU MUST AT LEAST HAVE ONE LITTLE PAPER TROTZKY WAS VERY PATIENT
WE SHALL NOT SUBMIT TO ANY ULTIMATUMS FROM SMALL GROUPS OF INTELLECTUALS WHICH ARE NOT FOLLOWED BY THE MASSES WHICH ARE PRACTICALLY ONLY SUPPORTED BY KORNILOVISTS SAVINKOVISTS YUNKERS AND SO FORTH
IF A SOCIALIST COALITION WERE FORMED HIS FACTION WOULD SUPPORT THE ENTIRE PROGRAMME
ITS OFFICIAL ORGAN IZVIESTIA NEWS BEGAN TO HINT THAT THE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS WAS NEARLY AT AN END SEE APP
AND AGAIN IN JULY IT WAS THE SPONTANEOUS RISING OF THE UNORGANISED PROLETARIAT WHICH ONCE MORE STORMED THE TAURIDE PALACE TO DEMAND THAT THE SOVIETS TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA
ONLY WHEN HE BROUGHT WORKMEN TO FORCE THE LOCKS WERE THEY GIVEN UP
NERATOV DIVES INTO THE WATER--TROTZKY FOLLOWS
HE URGED THE BOLSHEVIKI TO DENY THE RUMOURS
D PETROGRAD COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS PETROGRAD COUNCIL OF FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES 14
BUT COMMUNICATION WITH THE FACTORIES AND BARRACKS WAS ESTABLISHED BY MEANS OF MILITARY TELEPHONOGRAPH APPARATUS
WE DON'T STOP FOR ANYBODY
THE ENTIRE MACHINERY SET UP BY THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OF MARCH FUNCTIONED TO BLOCK THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
THE LETTISH RIFLEMEN THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED PRECISE INFORMATION THAT THE VALIANT LETTISH RIFLEMEN HAVE ARRIVED FROM THE FRONT AND TAKEN UP A POSITION IN THE REAR OF KERENSKY'S BANDS
WITHOUT FOOD WITHOUT ARTILLERY WITHOUT A PLAN
DESPERATELY I RAN AFTER THEM
GREAT GIANTS OF MEN WITH THE INNOCENT CLEAR EYES OF CHILDREN AND THE FACES OF EPIC WARRIORS
IF THERE ARE ENOUGH TROOPS FROM THE FRONT ON OUR SIDE WE SHALL NOT COMPROMISE WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
WE ARE PERFECTLY NEUTRAL
WHEREAT EVERY ONE ROSE TO SHAKE MY HAND AND ONE OLD SOLDIER PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME AND GAVE ME A HEARTY KISS
SOME OF THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS WERE IMPLICATED
THE EUROPEAN WORKING-CLASS WON'T MOVE
ANOTHER FOUND A PLUME OF OSTRICH FEATHERS WHICH HE STUCK IN HIS HAT
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BOOK ARE
AT THE END HE TOTERED ALMOST FALLING
AS THE DELEGATES STREAMED OUT LENIN STOOD UP IN HIS PLACE
IN THIS WAY WAS DISCOVERED THE MONARCHIST PLOT LED BY FORMER DUMA-MEMBER PURISHKEVITCH AND A GROUP OF NOBLES AND OFFICERS WHO HAD PLANNED AN OFFICERS UPRISING AND HAD WRITTEN A LETTER INVITING KALEDIN TO PETROGRAD
BUT FOR THAT WE MUST ESTABLISH SOME COMMUNICATION WITH YOU AND BEFORE ALL CLEAR UP THE FOLLOWING POINTS
WE WANTED TO GET RID OF THE KERENSKY GOVERNMENT TOO BUT WE THOUGHT IT BETTER TO WAIT FOR THE CONSTITUENT
IMMENSE TRUCKS LIKE OURS COLUMNS OF ARTILLERY WAGONS LOOMED UP IN THE NIGHT WITHOUT LIGHTS AS WE WERE
IN THE LOWER CHAMBER WILL BE TERRITORIAL REPRESENTATIVES
A LARGE CROWD HAD GATHERED TO WATCH THEM
ON NOVEMBER 20TH TROTZKY ADDRESSED A NOTE TO THE ALLIED AMBASSADORS
THE KRIVOYE ZERKALO STAGED A SUMPTUOUS VERSION OF SCHNITZLER'S REIGEN ALTHOUGH THE HERMITAGE AND OTHER PICTURE GALLERIES HAD BEEN EVACUATED TO MOSCOW THERE WERE WEEKLY EXHIBITIONS OF PAINTINGS
LONG LIVE THE LIGHT OF HUMANITY THE ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES OF THE WEST WHO FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING THE WAY WE NOW ONLY BEGIN TO ENTER WITH ILL-ASSURED AND HESITATING STEPS
MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT POSTED ON THE WALLS OF PETROGRAD OF THE RESULT OF A MEETING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GARRISON REGIMENTS CALLED TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT
TOWARD THE END THERE WAS A WEEK WITHOUT ANY BREAD AT ALL
BEYOND IN A LITTLE CLEARING THREE SOLDIERS SAT AROUND A SMALL FIRE PERFECTLY OBLIVIOUS
MARAT YOU'RE A BLOCKHEAD CRIES TROTZKY
WE SHALL NOT COOPERATE OUTSIDE THERE WAS A SHOT
GATCHINA ABOUT THIRTY KILOMETERS SOUTH-WEST HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT

THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION IS ASSURED 3
IN ORENBURG DUTOV HAS ARRESTED THE SOVIET AND DISARMED THE GARRISON
YOU ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE SOVIETS WISH TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LANDS FROM YOU
KERENSKY IS COMING FROM THE FRONT
WE MUST NOT REJECT THE LEGITIMATE HEIR TO THE THRONE MIKHAIL ALEXANDROVITCH OCTOBER 27TH
THE ORDER NOT BEING EXECUTED A LIGHT FIRE OF ARTILLERY WAS OPENED ON THE PLACE AT THE HOUR AGREED UPON
IN CHARGING YOU WITH THE CONDUCT OF THESE PRELIMINARY POURPARLERS THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ORDERS YOU
HERE IS THE CONTENTS READING
ULIANOV LENIN THE CENTRAL RADA AT KIEV IMMEDIATELY DECLARED UKRAINE AN INDEPENDENT REPUBLIC AS DID THE GOVERNMENT OF FINLAND THROUGH THE SENATE AT HELSINGFORS
KERENSKY IS FLOODING THE TRENCHES WITH TALES OF PETROGRAD BURNING AND BLOODY OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN MASSACRED BY THE BOLSHEVIKI
18 I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INFORM YOU MR AMBASSADOR THAT THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
WE ARE CALLING UPON YOU COSSACKS TO JOIN THIS NEW ORDER AND TO CREATE YOUR OWN SOVIETS OF COSSACKS DEPUTIES
FROM THE NORTHERN FRONT
IN CASE OF REFUSAL THE VIKZHEL THREATENED A GENERAL STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT OF NOVEMBER 11TH
GROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIES SEPTEMBER 18TH
WE WANT DEEDS--THE POWER MUST BE IN OUR HANDS LET THESE IMPOSTOR DELEGATES LEAVE THE CONGRESS
IN PETROGRAD THE STREET-CARS WERE RUNNING THE STORES AND RESTAURANTS OPEN THEATRES GOING AN EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS ADVERTISED
TROTZKY EXPLAINED MATTERS TO HIM
AFTER A FEW MINUTES HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING A GLASS OF TEA AND WENT BACK UP THE HALL
WHAT HAD FUSED THAT DISORGANISED MASS OF UNDISCIPLINED RED GUARDS AND SOLDIERS WITHOUT OFFICERS INTO AN ARMY OBEDIENT TO ITS OWN ELECTED HIGH COMMAND TEMPERED TO MEET AND BREAK THE ASSAULT OF CANNON AND COSSACK CAVALRY
THE ORDER HAS BEEN GIVEN TO PURSUE THE RETREATING COSSACKS
BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE PALACE WAS A CROWD OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
BUT FOR US--WELL IT HAS ONLY BEEN A YEAR YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF KERENSKY I ASKED
THE COMING STORM
COMRADES HE CRIED AND THERE WAS REAL ANGUISH IN HIS DRAWN FACE AND DESPAIRING GESTURES
REMEMBER YOUR DUTY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO THE REVOLUTION
POLKOVNIKOV ISSUED ORDER AFTER ORDER THREATENING TO REPRESS ALL INSUBORDINATION WITH THE UTMOST ENERGY KISHKIN MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION THE WORST-HATED MEMBER OF THE CABINET WAS APPOINTED SPECIAL COMMISSAR TO KEEP ORDER IN PETROGRAD
THE CENTRAL ARMY AND FLEET COMMITTEES THE CENTRAL COMMITTEES OF SOME OF THE TRADE UNIONS THE PEASANTS SOVIETS BUT MOST OF ALL THE TSAY-EE-KAH ITSELF SPARED NO PAINS TO PREVENT THE MEETING
THE THRONG SURGED BACK AND FORTH BEFORE THE BULLETIN BOARD WHERE WAS POSTED A LIST OF YUNKERS KILLED IN THE DAY'S FIGHTING--OR SUPPOSED TO BE KILLED FOR MOST OF THE DEAD AFTERWARD TURNED UP SAFE AND SOUND
MOST HOTELS AND PRIVATE HOUSES NEVER SAW IT FOR MONTHS
DO YOU WANT TO GO AND TALK WITH THEM BY THIS TIME IT WAS DUSK
V SECT
V SECT
V SECT
V SECT
V SECT
THEN SUPPORT THE CADETS THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORT TCHERNOV TSERETELLI SKOBELIEV WHO DROVE YOU INTO THE OFFENSIVE OF JULY 1ST
THE HONOUR OF THE WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS REVOLUTION CANNOT TOLERATE ANY DISORDERS
THE PROLETARIAT OF THE SCHOOLS HAS IN VAIN DEMANDED AN INCREASE OF SALARY TO ONE HUNDRED RUBLES PER MONTH
PETROGRAD NOVEMBER 10 1917
ON THE HIGH WALLS FLICKERED REDLY THE LIGHT OF HIDDEN FLAMES
THE ARMY OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC CONSISTS NOW OF FREE AND EQUAL CITIZENS BEARING THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF SOLDIERS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
THIS DOMINATION BY THE BOURGEOISIE IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY MEANS OF CIVIL WAR
ONLY BY THE CONCERTED ACTION OF THE POPULAR MASS ONLY BY THE VICTORY OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP CAN THE REVOLUTION BE ACHIEVED AND THE PEOPLE SAVED
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAD MOVED INTO LARGER QUARTERS ROOM 17 ON THE TOP FLOOR
IF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WERE REALLY GETTING READY FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY SIX WEEKS FROM NOW THERE COULD BE NO REASON FOR ESTABLISHING THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT AT THIS TIME
THE PRINCIPAL POINTS IN THE CITY WERE TO BE OCCUPIED BEFORE DAWN
SOLDIERS AND REVOLUTIONARY OFFICERS
THE PEOPLE CAN ONLY BE SAVED BY THE COMPLETION OF THE REVOLUTION
IN THE FACTORIES THOSE UNIQUE RUSSIAN ORGANISATIONS THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES,[4 GAINED EXPERIENCE AND STRENGTH AND A REALISATION OF THEIR HISTORICAL MISSION BY COMBAT WITH THE OLD ORDER
ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MASSES GOING TO SIT QUIETLY HERE WHILE THE OKHRANA OF THE BOLSHEVIKI TORTURES THEIR LEADERS TROTZKY WAS GESTURING FOR SILENCE
INSTRUCTION WILL SURELY BE AN IMPORTANT BUT NOT A DECISIVE ELEMENT
TERESTCHENKO DECLARED THAT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT EVEN EXAMINED VERKHOVSKY'S PROPOSITION
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF BOLSHEVIK SUCCESS
BUT THESE RUMOURS THEMSELVES CARRY WITH THEM A GREAT DANGER
A SAILOR WAS TELLING OF THE END OF THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
TRAVELLERS FROM WHITE AND SHINING LITTLE MOTHER MOSCOW TOLD FEARFUL TALES
ALSO THE SHOPS WERE CLOSED AND THE PROPERTIED CLASSES STAYED AT HOME--BUT FOR OTHER REASONS
LAND BREAD AN END TO THE SENSELESS WAR AN END TO SECRET DIPLOMACY SPECULATION TREACHERY
DELEGATIONS OF STARVING CRIPPLES OF ORPHANS WITH BLUE PINCHED FACES BESIEGED THE BUILDING
BUT IN RECOMMENDING THAT THE PEASANTS SEIZE THE LAND BY FORCE THEY COMMITTED A PROFOUND ERROR
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON SEVERAL BOLSHEVIK ARMOURED CARS CRUISED AROUND THE PALACE SQUARE AND SOVIET SOLDIERS TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO PARLEY WITH THE YUNKERS
THE ULTIMATUM WAS REJECTED
PLEASE ACCEPT MR AMBASSADOR THE PROFOUND ASSURANCE OF THE ESTEEM OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT TOWARD YOUR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT BUT WISH FOR PEACE LIKE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLES EXHAUSTED AND DRAINED BY THIS UNEXAMPLED BUTCHERY
AS WE CAME UP TO SMOLNY--NOT ABANDONED BUT BUSIER THAN EVER THRONGS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS RUNNING IN AND OUT AND DOUBLED GUARDS EVERYWHERE--WE MET THE REPORTERS FOR THE BOURGEOIS AND MODERATE SOCIALIST PAPERS
EVERY BILL IS PRESENTED FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT BY THE RESPECTIVE MINISTRY SIGNED BY THE DULY AUTHORISED PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR
WE THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE THE PARTY OF THE PROLETARIAT--OF THE PEASANT PROLETARIAT AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL PROLETARIAT
PASSING UNDER THE HUGE GREY STONE ARCHWAY OF THE MOSKOVSKY GATE COVERED WITH GOLDEN HIEROGLYPHICS PONDEROUS IMPERIAL EAGLES AND THE NAMES OF TSARS WE SPED OUT ON THE WIDE STRAIGHT HIGHWAY GREY WITH THE FIRST LIGHT FALL OF SNOW
THE STAFF STEADILY REFUSED TO RECOGNISE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
COUNTESS PANINA WAS ARRESTED AND BROUGHT TO TRIAL BEFORE THE FIRST SUPREME REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL
WE CANNOT CALMLY LOOK ON WHILE THE POLICY OF THE CHIEFS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE LEADS TOWARD THE LOSS OF THE FRUITS OF VICTORY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE PROLETARIAT
THE PAPERS WERE SCRIBBLED OVER WITH BEGINNINGS OF PLANS OF ACTION ROUGH DRAFTS OF PROCLAMATIONS AND MANIFESTOS
THE SECRETARY ANTONOV IN REALITY THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO RAISE THE POPULACE AGAINST THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS TO BREAK THE CONSTITUENT AND TO OPEN THE FRONT TO THE REGIMENTS OF THE IRON FIST OF WILHELM
IT MUST NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO BE HALTED BY THE LACK OF EDUCATION OF THE MASS AVERAGE BUT IT MUST LEAD THE MASSES USING THE SOVIETS AS ORGANS OF REVOLUTIONARY INITIATIVE
ALL THE POPULAR ORGANISATIONS ARE INVITED TO COOPERATE IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE SPOLIATORS OF FOOD SUPPLIES
YOU SEE IT ALL SPRINGS FROM OUR VICTORY
THE SAILORS WOULDN'T LET THEM LEAVE
WHAT SIDE DO YOU BELONG TO I ASKED
THEY ARE FOLLOWING A LITTLE LATER AS WE SAT AT THE PRESS TABLE IN THE BIG HALL AN ANARCHIST WHO WAS WRITING FOR THE BOURGEOIS PAPERS PROPOSED TO ME THAT WE GO AND FIND OUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PRESIDIUM
ACROSS THE RED SQUARE A DARK KNOT OF MEN CAME HURRYING
THE CORRUPT REACTIONARIES IN CONTROL OF THE TSAR'S COURT DELIBERATELY UNDERTOOK TO WRECK RUSSIA IN ORDER TO MAKE A SEPARATE PEACE WITH GERMANY
THE BOLSHEVIK SOLDIERS WHO WERE WITHOUT LEADERS OR ORGANISATION FELL BACK TOWARD THE CAPITAL
FOREIGN AFFAIRS VURITSKY AND TROTZKY
THEY ARE PRINTING ORDERS OF THE TRAITOR KERENSKY AND CREATING A PANIC IN THE CITY SPREADING THE MOST RIDICULOUS RUMOURS OF MYTHICAL VICTORIES BY THAT RENEGADE
A YUNKER WHO HAD BEEN IN THE WINTER PALACE TOLD A HIGHLY-COLOURED TALE OF THE HEROISM OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMRADES AND DISGRACEFUL CONDUCT OF THE RED GUARDS--ALL OF WHICH WAS DEVOUTLY BELIEVED
SKRIPNIK EMERGING FROM THE INNER ROOM SAID THAT GOTZ HAD BEEN ARRESTED BUT HAD FLATLY DENIED SIGNING THE PROCLAMATION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AS HAD AVKSENTIEV
WE WANTED TO SETTLE MATTERS WITHOUT BLOODSHED
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS
IT IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT IN PETROGRAD JUST BEFORE TROUBLE
ONE MUST ALWAYS GO FORWARD--OR GO BACK
BUILDINGS COMMUNAL LANDS AND VILLAGES WITH THEIR PRIVATE GARDENS AND THEIR ORCHARDS REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THEIR PRESENT OWNERS
BEHIND US THE STREET WAS ALIVE WITH PEOPLE RUNNING AND STOOPING
I'M THE COMMISSAR HE SAID TO ME
FOR ANSWER HE IS CIRCULATING AMONG THE TROOPS THE NOTE FROM THE MILITARY ATTACHES OF THE ALLIED IMPERIALIST POWERS AND ATTEMPTING TO PROVOKE A COUNTER-REVOLUTION
THERE IS DANGER FOR THE SAFETY OF PETROGRAD
COUNTER-REVOLUTION HAS RAISED ITS CRIMINAL HEAD
COUNTER-REVOLUTION HAS RAISED ITS CRIMINAL HEAD
THE RULE OF THE DEMOCRACY WHICH IS BEING ESTABLISHED IN RUSSIA DEMANDS THAT THE DOMINATION OF THE PRESS BY PRIVATE PROPERTY MUST BE ABOLISHED JUST AS THE DOMINATION OF INDUSTRY BY PRIVATE PROPERTY
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS SOVIETS ALSO ISSUED A NAKAZ WHICH DIFFERS LITTLE FROM THE ABOVE 6
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT A QUORUM WOULD NOT COME TOGETHER BY NOVEMBER 2 SO THE OPENING OF THE CONGRESS WAS POSTPONED TO THE 7TH
ON THE WALLS A VAINGLORIOUS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE VIKZHEL THREATENING TO STRIKE IF BOTH SIDES DID NOT COMPROMISE
THE WORKING-CLASS QUARTERS WERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN AND NO STREET-CARS WERE RUNNING
THE SECOND IS DEFINITELY TO DISARM THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY ELEMENTS OF PETROGRAD
THE RICH COSSACKS WHO KNOW THAT THE SOVIET AUTHORITY WISHES TO TRANSFER THE LANDOWNERS LANDS TO YOU
THIS COMMUNICATION DUKHONIN AT ONCE SENT OUT TO ALL THE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES
DECLARES
WE WARN THEM THAT THEY ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE
THIS WORKERS MILITIA SHALL BE ENTIRELY AT THE ORDERS OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
THERE MUST NOT BE CIVIL WAR BETWEEN SOLDIERS WHO STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AGAINST THE TSAR AND CONQUERED THE FOREIGN ENEMY IN BATTLES WHICH WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY
FROM THE MOMENT OF THE SIGNATURE OF THIS PEACE TREATY BOTH PARTIES SHALL IMMEDIATELY GIVE ORDER TO CEASE FIRING AND HALT ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS TAKING MEASURES TO ENSURE PUNCTUAL OBEDIENCE TO THIS ORDER
COSSACKS
COSSACKS
COSSACKS
COSSACKS
ABRAMOVITCH FOR THE CENTRE MENSHEVIKI SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE NEITHER CONQUERORS NOR CONQUERED--THAT BYGONES SHOULD BE BYGONES
THEY REVISED THE PLAN OF REPRESENTATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE SEE APP
UNTIL THE MEETING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY A PROVISIONAL WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT IS FORMED WHICH SHALL BE NAMED THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
SOONER OR LATER THE FOREIGN POWERS MUST INTERVENE HERE--AS ONE WOULD INTERVENE TO CURE A SICK CHILD AND TEACH IT HOW TO WALK
COMRADES WORKERS
AS FOR US BOLSHEVIKI WE WILL NOT VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION WHEREUPON ALL THE BOLSHEVIKI LEFT THE HALL AND THE RESOLUTION WAS PASSED
THE GARRISON COMMITTEE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE PETROGRAD
AND IN THE CORRIDOR SO JAMMED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS VIOLENT POLITICAL DEBATES RAGED ALL NIGHT LONG
THE TOILING MASSES OF THE PEOPLE--THE WORKMEN THE PEASANTS THE SOLDIERS--ARE THIRSTING FOR ELEMENTARY AND ADVANCED INSTRUCTION
BEFORE THE DOOR OF SMOLNY WAS AN AUTOMOBILE
IN VAIN HE TRIED TO ARGUE TO EXPLAIN
THE DIRECT RESULT OF ALL THIS WAS THE RISE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE PRESIDIUM ARRANGES THE ORDER OF BUSINESS AND ITS MEMBERS CAN BE CALLED UPON BY THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE THE CHAIR PRO TEM EACH QUESTION VOPROS IS STATED IN A GENERAL WAY AND THEN DEBATED AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE DEBATE RESOLUTIONS ARE SUBMITTED BY THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS AND EACH ONE VOTED ON SEPARATELY
THE QUESTIONS OF PEACE LAND AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE ARMY OUGHT TO BE STATED IN SUCH A FASHION THAT NO SOLDIER PEASANT OR WORKER WOULD HAVE THE LEAST DOUBT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS ATTEMPTING FIRMLY AND INFALLIBLY TO SOLVE THEM
THE BOLSHEVIKI RESPONDED BY SUMMONING THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS TO MEET AT PETROGRAD ON NOVEMBER 2 AND TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA
ONE GIANT OF A SOLDIER STOOD IN OUR PATH HIS FACE DARK WITH SULLEN SUSPICION
IT WAS THE REALISATION OF THE STRIKE FUND CONTRIBUTORS THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE FIRMLY IN POWER FOLLOWED BY THEIR REFUSAL TO PAY STRIKE BENEFITS WHICH FINALLY BROKE THE STRIKE
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE ONLY TWO CLASSES THE PROLETARIAT AND THE BOURGEOISIE THERE YOU GO AGAIN WITH YOUR SILLY FORMULA CRIED THE STUDENT
PETROGRAD IS IN DANGER HE WROTE I SAY TO MYSELF LET GOD TAKE CARE OF PETROGRAD THEY FEAR THAT IF PETROGRAD IS LOST THE CENTRAL REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS WILL BE DESTROYED
AT THAT TIME THEY WERE ARMED AND ALL EFFORTS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DISARM THEM WERE MORE OR LESS UNSUCCESSFUL
THERE ARE TWO FACTORS IN THE FALLING OFF OF INTEREST IN THE SOVIETS
THE NEWSPAPERS SAID THAT ALL THE FACTORIES OF PETROGRAD MUST SHUT DOWN FOR LACK OF FUEL IN THREE WEEKS
UNDER THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THE POMIESHTCHIKI FLATLY REFUSED TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THE LAND COMMITTEES--THOSE LAND COMMITTEES PROJECTED BY LVOV BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE BY SHINGARIOV AND ADMINISTERED BY KERENSKY BEFORE THE DEBATES COULD BEGIN A MAN FORCED HIS WAY VIOLENTLY THROUGH THE CROWD IN THE AISLE AND CLIMBED UPON THE PLATFORM
WAS RUSSIA RISING AGAINST THEM
AT EVERY GREAT CRISIS IN THE REVOLUTION THE RED GUARDS APPEARED ON THE STREETS UNTRAINED AND UNDISCIPLINED BUT FULL OF REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL
AFTER BITTER QUARRELLING A COMMISSION WAS ELECTED TO DRAW UP A WORKABLE PLAN
YOU MUST STRENGTHEN ITS AUTHORITY
THIS REFERS AS WELL TO REFORMS OF THE INSTITUTES OF GENERAL EDUCATION
SHOOTING OF CHIEF OF THE CITY MILITIA MEYER
THERE IS GOING TO BE PEACE BUT NOT PERMANENT PEACE--NOT A DEMOCRATIC PEACE
THEIR SYMPATHISERS HALT THE WORK OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE DUMA INCITE STRIKES IN THE BANKS TRY TO INTERRUPT COMMUNICATION BY THE RAILWAYS THE POST AND THE TELEGRAPH
THE RICH CLASSES OPPOSE THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS--THE GOVERNMENT OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
IT MUST INTRODUCE UNIVERSAL OBLIGATORY AND FREE TUITION FOR ALL AND ESTABLISH AT THE SAME TIME A SERIES OF SUCH TEACHERS INSTITUTES AND SEMINARIES AS WILL IN THE SHORTEST TIME FURNISH A POWERFUL ARMY OF PEOPLE'S TEACHERS SO NECESSARY FOR THE UNIVERSAL INSTRUCTION OF THE POPULATION OF OUR BOUNDLESS RUSSIA
ALL THE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE BANK STRUCK EXCEPT THE CLERKS IN CHARGE OF THE VAULTS AND THE MANUFACTURE OF MONEY WHO REFUSED ALL DEMANDS FROM SMOLNY AND PRIVATELY PAID OUT HUGE SUMS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND THE CITY DUMA
WE EXPLAINED THAT RUMOURS WERE GOING ABOUT THAT THE YUNKERS WERE BEING TORTURED AND THE LIVES OF THE MINISTERS THREATENED
IN TIME OF TROUBLE PRIVATE CARS WERE REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF FOREIGN CONSULATES SO AS TO BE SAFE FROM REQUISITION FROM THE INTERIOR OF THIS WAS DISLODGED A FAT CITIZEN IN AN EXPENSIVE FUR COAT AND THE PARTY CONTINUED ON ITS WAY
SILENCE OR I'LL HAVE YOU PUT OUT VOICE
IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE WHY PEOPLE BELIEVED WHEN LENIN SPOKE
HUNDREDS WERE IMPRISONED AMONG THEM TROTZKY MADAME KOLLONTAI AND KAMENIEV
THEY SWARMED INTO THE PITS PICKED UP THE TOOLS AND BEGAN DIGGING DIGGING WITHOUT A WORD
AS WE SPED ALONG THE SILENT SNOWY HALF-LIGHTED STREETS HE RECOUNTED HIS ADVENTURES DURING THE SIX DAYS FIGHTING
OF A SUDDEN THEY BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND THEN WITH A RUSH THUNDERING WITH FACES FULL OF HATE
REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET POWER CAN BE PROUD OF THEIR PULKOVO DETACHMENT ACTING UNDER THE COMMAND OF COLONEL WALDEN
THAT THEY ARE STILL IN PETER-PAUL IS ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH TO DO
A FEW HOURS LATER THIS WAS DENIED BY THE PRINCE'S FAMILY WHO ADDED THAT THE PRINCE WAS UNDER ARREST SO THE PRESS IDENTIFIED THE DEAD MAN AS GENERAL DEMISSOV
UNDERFOOT THE SIDEWALK WAS LITTERED WITH BROKEN STUCCO FROM THE CORNICE OF THE PALACE WHERE TWO SHELLS FROM THE BATTLESHIP AVRORA HAD STRUCK
THEY WILL MASSACRE US
NEWS OF THE TREATMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS IN FRANCE ADDED TO THE DISCONTENT
I AM INVESTED WITH EXTRAORDINARY POWERS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER IN PETROGRAD IN COMPLETE COMMAND OF ALL CIVIL AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON ME BY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT I HEREWITH RELIEVE FROM HIS FUNCTIONS AS COMMANDANT OF THE PETROGRAD MILITARY DISTRICT COLONEL GEORGE POLKOVNIKOV APPEAL TO THE POPULATION SIGNED BY VICE-PREMIER KONOVALOV NOVEMBER 7TH
AND JUST AS IN THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS CONGRESS AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY DECLARED IN FAVOUR OF THE WIDEST POSSIBLE REPRESENTATION
IN THIS MOMENT THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE RUSSIAN NATION THOSE GROUPS AND PARTIES WHO HAVE DARED TO LIFT THEIR HANDS AGAINST THE FREE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME THREATENING TO OPEN THE FRONT TO GERMANY MUST BE LIQUIDATED WITH DECISION
THIS WAS TABLED HOWEVER FOR THERE WERE NO PERSONAL CHARGES AGAINST THE MEMBERS AND THEY WERE ACTIVE IN THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION
FOR TWO DAYS NOW THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE CITY
THREATENING IN CASE OF REFUSAL TO BOMBARD HEADQUARTERS
FOR WE WERE FOREIGNERS AND THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE DWELLINGS OF FOREIGNERS
MILIUKOV VINAVER SHATSKY
EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE FIGHTING WE SALLIED OUT INTO THE TOWN
SMOLNY INSTITUTE HEADQUARTERS OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET LAY MILES OUT ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY BESIDE THE WIDE NEVA
ON THE ELECTIVE PRINCIPLE AND THE ORGANISATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE ARMY 1
SUDDENLY WITH A SHOUT THE SAILORS LEAPED UP AND RUSHED INTO THE FLAMING OPEN
THE BOLSHEVIK PAPERS WERE SUPPRESSED
WHY DID YOU COME HERE SHOUTED VOICES
SO WITH THE CRASH OF ARTILLERY IN THE DARK WITH HATRED AND FEAR AND RECKLESS DARING NEW RUSSIA WAS BEING BORN
WHEN WE WERE DOWN THEY WOULD'T HAVE US AT ANY PRICE
IT WAS ALMOST SEVEN WHEN WE WOKE THE SLEEPING CONDUCTORS AND MOTOR-MEN OF THE STREET-CARS WHICH THE STREET-RAILWAY WORKERS UNION ALWAYS KEPT WAITING AT SMOLNY TO TAKE THE SOVIET DELEGATES TO THEIR HOMES
WHAT CAN YOU DO WE WILL DO SOMETHING REPLIED THE SAILOR EVIDENTLY AT A LOSS
COMRADES SOLDIERS AND COSSACKS ON US FALLS THE DUTY OF KEEPING REAL REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
OUR ARMOURED CARS RUSHED IN AMONG THE RANKS OF THE ENEMY
THE TRADITIONAL PEASANT PARTY WAS THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
A GREAT IDEA HAS TRIUMPHED
CLEAR THE PALACE BAWLED A RED GUARD STICKING HIS HEAD THROUGH AN INNER DOOR
KERENSKY THEN CONTINUED
IT CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE GERMANS OR THE BRITISH
TO SUCH SOVIETS ALL THE POWER MUST BELONG IN THE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES
I CAN PERSONALLY TESTIFY TO THIS
CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD
CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD
CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD
THE DAY OF THE UNION OF THE CONGRESS OF PEASANTS AND THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES IS ONE OF THE GREAT DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION
IN SPITE OF THE CRIMINAL INACTION OF THE CONSCIOUS PEOPLE HERE WHICH ALLOWED THE YOKE OF BOLSHEVISM TO BE LAID UPON US--IN SPITE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PIG--HEADEDNESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OFFICERS SO DIFFICULT TO ORGANISE--WE BELIEVE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT TRUTH IS ON OUR SIDE AND THAT WE SHALL CONQUER THE VICIOUS AND CRIMINAL FORCES WHO SAY THAT THEY ARE ACTING FOR MOTIVES OF LOVE OF COUNTRY AND IN ORDER TO SAVE IT
IN THE LAST ELECTIONS WE RECEIVED IN ALL THE COUNTRY MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT OF ALL THEVOTES
SUCH AN IMMENSE SPONTANEOUS OUTPOURING OF A CITY NEVER WAS SEEN
SHORTLY AFTERWARD WE HEARD THEM BREAKING INTO A COMPARTMENT OCCUPIED BY TWO STOUT WELL-DRESSED RUSSIANS WHO HAD BRIBED THE CONDUCTOR AND LOCKED THEIR DOOR
AFTER THEIR SURRENDER MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OF THE MUTINEERS WERE SHOT IN COLD BLOOD
VERY WELL HE SAID IN A DIFFERENT VOICE
HOW DO YOU KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE WAS THERE AND SAW THEM HOW COULD HE TELL THEY WERE GERMAN OFFICERS OH BECAUSE THEY WORE GERMAN UNIFORMS THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF SUCH ABSURD TALES AND THEY WERE NOT ONLY SOLEMNLY PUBLISHED BY THE ANTI-BOLSHEVIK PRESS BUT BELIEVED BY THE MOST UNLIKELY PERSONS--SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND MENSHEVIKI WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR SOBER DEVOTION TO FACTS
IN REALITY WE OURSELVES ARE THE HARDEST WORKERS IN CONSTRUCTING THE NEW RUSSIA
ALMOST ALL THE REAL WORK OF THE SESSION IS DONE IN CAUCUSES OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND POLITICAL FACTIONS WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS CAST THEIR VOTES IN A BODY AND ARE REPRESENTED BY FLOOR-LEADERS
THE PROCESSION STOOD STILL BUT FROM THE FRONT OF IT CAME LOUD ARGUMENT
THERE WAS A HOLIDAY FEELING IN THE AIR
THEY KNOW THAT AT THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WE WILL TAKE THE LAND ANYWAY SO THEY ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY A MACHINIST FROM THE PUTILOV WORKS DESCRIBED HOW THE SUPERINTENDENTS WERE CLOSING DOWN THE DEPARTMENTS ONE BY ONE ON THE PRETEXT THAT THERE WAS NO FUEL OR RAW MATERIALS
A SMILE WENT AROUND THE TABLE BUT I CAUGHT ONE OR TWO GLANCING FURTIVELY AT THE ORDERLY
HE ENTERED SMILING A TALL DISTINGUISHED FIGURE IN A GOAT-SKIN CAPE EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD
IN WIDE-SPREADING RIPPLES NEWS OF THE MIRACLE SPREAD OVER THE FACE OF THE LAND AND IN ITS WAKE TOWNS CITIES AND FAR VILLAGES STIRRED AND BROKE SOVIETS AND MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES AGAINST DUMAS ZEMSTVOS AND GOVERNMENT COMMISSARS--RED GUARDS AGAINST WHITE--STREET FIGHTING AND PASSIONATE SPEECH
WHY MY FRIEND I SPENT TWO YEARS IN SCHLUESSELBURG FOR REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY WHEN YOU WERE STILL SHOOTING DOWN REVOLUTIONISTS AND SINGING GOD SAVE THE TSAR MY NAME IS VASILI GEORGEVITCH PANYIN
CHAPTER VI THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION FRIDAY NOVEMBER 9TH
THE COLONEL COURTEOUSLY SENT HIS ORDERLY TO ESCORT US TO THE RAILROAD STATION
THE PRISONERS THEY SAID WERE GETTING THE SAME FOOD AS THE GUARDS WHEN THERE WASN'T EVEN ENOUGH TO KEEP A MAN FROM BEING HUNGRY
THEN UNTIL OCTOBER
WHICH SIDE WILL YOU BE ON
A LIE
DECLARATIONS
ESTABLISH A STRICT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCTS
IN THE FAST-DEEPENING TWILIGHT WE TRUDGED ALONG THE MUDDY ROAD
PUT SEVERAL HUNDRED PEASANTS IN PRISON MEMBERS OF THE LAND COMMITTEES AND SUPPRESSED DOZENS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS NEWSPAPERS
REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
THE COWARDS ARE AFRAID OF US
THERE REMAINS A PHENOMENON WHICH PUZZLED FOREIGN OBSERVERS
FOR WHAT THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE CARRYING ON IS NOT A POLITICAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR EVEN FOR THE POWER
THEY HAD BEEN ELECTED A COMMITTEE OF THE FORTRESS GARRISON TO PROTEST
I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TSARSKOYE SELO COMRADES HE SAID
WE SHOULD GET OUR MINDS OFF THE REVOLUTION NOW AND CONCENTRATE ON THE GERMANS
THIS DUMA CROWD WAS WELL-FED WELL-DRESSED
IN ROOM 10 ON THE TOP FLOOR THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SAT IN CONTINUOUS SESSION UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF A TOW-HEADED EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED LAZIMIR
LET HIM SMASH THE CHEST OPEN AND WRITE DOWN WHAT HE FINDS THERE I SWUNG THE AXE
A TELEGRAM HAS BEEN SENT TO THE STAVKA AND AN ANSWER RECEIVED SAYS THAT A STRONG DETACHMENT OF TROOPS IS BEING SENT
I AM NOT GOING TO DISTURB THE PRISONERS AGAIN
2 LITTERED THE FLOOR
THE DOORMAN GRUMBLED AS HE PUT ON MY COAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS BECOMING OF POOR RUSSIA
IT SHOWED ITSELF CLEARLY IN OCTOBER WHEN THE LEFT WING OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES SPLIT OFF AND FORMED A NEW POLITICAL FACTION THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
ADVERTISING OFFICES ARE CONFISCATED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE OWNERS BEING ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION IN CASES OF NECESSITY
A COMMITTEE OF FIVE SOLDIERS WAS ELECTED TO SERVE AS GENERAL STAFF AND IN THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING THE REGIMENTS LEFT THEIR BARRACKS IN FULL BATTLE ARRAY
LANDLORD ESTATES--WITHOUT COMPENSATION--TO THE PEASANTS
INSTEAD OF OPENING THE BANKS AS HAD BEEN ORDERED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE UNION OF BANK EMPLOYEES HAD HELD A MEETING AND DECLARED A FORMAL STRIKE
THE BOURGEOISIE TRIED TO ISOLATE THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY
WE HAILED A CAB
DOCTORS ENGINEERS TECHNICIANS TELEGRAPH AND WIRELESS OPERATORS AVIATORS AUTOMOBILISTS ETC ONLY SUCH PERSONS AS POSSESS THE REQUIRED SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE MAY BE ELECTED BY THE COMMITTEES OF THE UNITS OF THE RESPECTIVE SERVICES
IN REPLY TO THIS ARISES A PLAN TO MOVE THE GOVERNMENT TO MOSCOW
NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS TO THE AVERAGE READER THE MULTIPLICITY OF RUSSIAN ORGANISATIONS--POLITICAL GROUPS COMMITTEES AND CENTRAL COMMITTEES SOVIETS DUMAS AND UNIONS--WILL PROVE EXTREMELY CONFUSING
I GET TO A NICE QUIET STREET AND STOP DOZE A LITTLE POOFF ANOTHER CANNON BALL RATT-RATT
CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI TCHERNOV CONTINUED
OF ALL THE HUNDREDS OF EMPLOYEES NOT ONE WOULD SHOW HIM WHERE THE OFFICE OF THE MINISTER WAS
THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS FOR WAR AND MARINE WERE GOING TO INSPECT THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT--WHEREVER THAT WAS
HALF THE LIEBER-DANS ARE COWARDLY COMPROMISERS
COME COMRADES LET'S SHOW THAT WE'RE NOT THIEVES AND BANDITS
MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ARE ALREADY ARRESTED
THAT IS WHY I AM LEAVING THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
IT HAD UNITED ABOUT IT THE DEATH BATTALIONS THE KNIGHTS OF ST GEORGE AND THE COSSACKS OF THE FRONT AND WAS IN CLOSE AND SECRET TOUCH WITH THE ALLIED MILITARY ATTACHES AND WITH THE KALEDIN MOVEMENT AND THE UKRAINEAN RADA
COMRADES STRENGTHEN YOUR POSITION IN MATTERS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION INSIST ON THE CONTROL OF THE PROLETARIAN ORGANISATIONS OVER THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ATTACHED TO THE CENTRAL CITY DUMA 18
BONI AND LIVERIGHT N.Y 1919
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WANTED MERELY A POLITICAL REVOLUTION WHICH WOULD TAKE THE POWER FROM THE TSAR AND GIVE IT TO THEM
AFTER LONG DELIBERATION HAVING HEARD THE DECLARATIONS OF ALL PARTIES AND ORGANISATIONS THE MEETING BY A TREMENDOUS MAJORITY OF VOTES AGREED THAT ONLY THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ARE FOR THE PEOPLE AND THAT ALL THE OTHER PARTIES ARE ONLY ATTEMPTING UNDER COVER OF SEEKING AN AGREEMENT TO DEPRIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE CONQUESTS WON IN THE DAYS OF THE GREAT WORKERS AND PEASANTS REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER
HENCEFORTH IT MUST BE REPLACED BY AN OPEN AND HONEST POLICY LEADING TO THE COMPLETE MUTUAL CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA
WE HAVE THE POWER IN OUR HANDS HE BEGAN SADLY STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WENT ON IN A LOW VOICE
DON'T TRUST THEM
DO YOU KNOW THAT LENIN TOOK MONEY FROM THE GERMANS WELL I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT ANSWERED THE SOLDIER STUBBORNLY BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT HE SAYS IS WHAT I WANT TO HEAR AND ALL THE SIMPLE MEN LIKE ME
IF THE BOLSHEVIKI CHAMPIONED THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY BEFORE THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION WHY DID THEY DISPERSE IT BY FORCE OF ARMS AFTERWARD
BEGAN AN ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT FROM THREE SIDES IN WHICH MOST OF THE SHELLS WERE BLANKS ONLY THREE SMALL SHRAPNELS STRIKING THE FACADE OF THE PALACE
DO NOT RECOGNISE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND STRUGGLE AGAINST IT
IT WAS THE MAYOR WHO HAD URGED THE OCCUPATION OF THE KREMLIN
THE RIGHT WING THEN WALKED OUT OF THE CONGRESS AND CALLED A CONGRESS OF ITS OWN WHICH WENT ON DWINDLING FROM DAY TO DAY UNTIL IT FINALLY DISSOLVED
MANY APOLOGISTS FOR KERENSKY SAY THAT HE KNEW OF KORNILOV'S PLANS AND BY A TRICK DREW HIM OUT PREMATURELY AND THEN CRUSHED HIM
THE TWELFTH ARMY SENDS GREETINGS TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS ANNOUNCING THE FORMATION OF A MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHICH HAS TAKEN OVER THE COMMAND OF THE NORTHERN FRONT PANDEMONIUM MEN WEEPING EMBRACING EACH OTHER
SNOW CRIED THE SOLDIER AT THE DOOR GRINNING WITH DELIGHT
UNION OF OFFICERS AN ORGANISATION FORMED AMONG THE REACTIONARY OFFICERS IN THE ARMY TO COMBAT POLITICALLY THE GROWING POWER OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES
8 NOTHING
ONE HAD A GASH ACROSS THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER
THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY FUNCTIONARIES ARE THE MOST DISHONEST CRIMINALS TOWARD THEIR HUNGRY AND DYING BRETHREN ON THE FRONT
THE INDEPENDENT MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEQUESTRATE ALL UNOCCUPIED OR UNINHABITED DWELLING-PLACES
GERMAN DIPLOMACY ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE PUBLIC OPINION
THE DUMA IS NOT A CENTRE OF COUNTER-REVOLUTION HE SAID WARMLY
THERE IS NO MIDDLE COURSE 4
WE DEMAND TO PASS THEY CRIED
HE WAS ANXIOUSLY FIGURING ON A DIRTY ENVELOPE AND BITING HIS PENCIL MEANWHILE
THE WOMEN'S BATTALION DECIDED TO REMAIN LOYAL TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE WOMEN SOLDIERS IN THE PALACE YES THEY ARE IN THE BACK ROOMS WHERE THEY WON'T BE HURT IF ANY TROUBLE COMES HE SIGHED
INSULT THE OLD MAYOR WITH DIGNITY REMINDED HIM THAT THE DUMA WAS ELECTED BY THE FREEST POSSIBLE POPULAR VOTE
THIS WILL BE DEALT WITH VERY FULLY IN THE SECOND VOLUME NOW IN PREPARATION KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK CONCERNING DWELLING-PLACES 1
ON DECEMBER 2D THE GARRISON OF MOGHILEV ROSE AND SEIZED THE CITY ARRESTING DUKHONIN AND THE ARMY COMMITTEE AND GOING OUT WITH VICTORIOUS RED BANNERS TO MEET THE NEW SUPREME COMMANDER
WE STARTED WITH A SHOUT AT TOP SPEED OF COURSE
NOW HOWEVER WITH THE PASSAGE OF POWER TO THE SOVIETS THE REALLY DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS ASSURED
IT WAS COLD AND AT THE OUTER GATE THE RED GUARDS HAD BUILT THEMSELVES A BON-FIRE
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM ANTONOV PRODUCED A PAPER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN THAT HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF ALL THE ARMIES OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC AND THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD OBEY HIM WITHOUT QUESTION
1 WHICH EXPLAINED THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN SIMPLE TERMS
THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD CAPTURED THE MINISTRY OF WAR EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW OF THE MILITARY TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN THE ATTIC NOR OF THE PRIVATE TELEPHONE LINE CONNECTING IT WITH THE WINTER PALACE
I FORBID ABSOLUTELY ANY EXECUTION BY SOLDIERS OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM OTHER ORGANISATIONS
CERTAINLY
ALREADY DELEGATES FROM ALL PARTS OF THE FRONT ARE TALKING OF A NECESSARY REMOVAL OF PART OF THE ARMY TO THE REAR FORESEEING THAT IN A FEW DAYS THERE WILL BE HEADLONG FLIGHT OF THE SOLDIERS DYING FROM HUNGER RAVAGED BY THE THREE YEARS WAR IN THE TRENCHES SICK INSUFFICIENTLY CLOTHED BARE-FOOTED DRIVEN MAD BY SUPERHUMAN MISERY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE BRINGS THIS TO THE NOTICE OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISON AND THE WORKERS OF PETROGRAD
THE DUMA WAS AGAIN IN SESSION IN THE NICOLAI HALL
AT EVERY MEETING ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT THE TIME OF SPEAKERS VOTED DOWN AND EVERY MAN FREE TO EXPRESS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIM
RAILWAY MEN
DO NOT DIG TRENCHES
MEN LITERALLY OUT OF THEMSELVES LIVING PRODIGIES OF SLEEPLESSNESS AND WORK-MEN UNSHAVEN FILTHY WITH BURNING EYES WHO DROVE UPON THEIR FIXED PURPOSE FULL SPEED ON ENGINES OF EXALTATION
AS WE WENT HOME THE AIR WAS FULL OF CONFUSED SOUND--AUTOMOBILE HORNS SHOUTS DISTANT SHOTS
THEY HAVE ARRESTED THE MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT CLOSED THE NEWSPAPERS SEIZED THE PRINTING-SHOPS....THIS POWER MUST BE CONSIDERED THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE AND THE REVOLUTION
COMMITTEE TO FIGHT AGAINST POGROMS ATTACHED TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES 12
ALL THE MEANS OF EDUCATION HAVING BEEN IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES THE INTELLECTUALS INSTINCTIVELY REACTED TO THEIR TRAINING AND TOOK THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
THE COLONEL IS A MENSHEVIK
ROUGH DIRTY MEN WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SPATTERED AND CAKED WITH MUD SPRAWLED ALONE OR IN HEAPS IN THE CARELESS ATTITUDES OF DEATH
THE MEN WHO BEGAN THEIR STROKE OF TREACHERY IN THE NIGHT WHO HAVE SUPPRESSED THE NEWSPAPERS WILL NOT KEEP THE COUNTRY IN IGNORANCE LONG
TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD
TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD
HUGE BOLTS OF RED AND BLACK COTTON CLOTH WERE UNROLLED SERPENTINING ACROSS THE PARQUETED FLOOR AND OVER TABLES AT WHICH SAT HALF A HUNDRED WOMEN CUTTING AND SEWING STREAMERS AND BANNERS FOR THE FUNERAL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEAD
THE COMMITTEE OF YUNKERS OF THE PETROGRAD DETACHMENT OF FRANC-TIREURS
WE HAVE SENT A COMMITTEE TO KERENSKY TO SAY THAT IF HE CONTINUES TO MARCH ON PETROGRAD WE WILL BREAK HIS LINES OF COMMUNICATION HE MADE THE USUAL PLEA FOR A CONFERENCE OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT
FOR THE PRESIDENT PODVOISKY
ON THE 15TH THE TSAY-EE-KAH FOLLOWING ITS PROCEDURE TOWARD THE PEASANTS CALLED AN ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF RAILWAY WORKERS FOR DECEMBER 1ST
HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF THE STATE OF RUSSIA
CHAIRMAN OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE COMMANDER IN CHIEF PODVOISKY
THEY WITHDREW FROM THE GOVERNMENT SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS RETURNED
PEACE IS COMING DYBENKO LOOKED UP AS WE CAME IN
THE COSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE
IN THE EVENT OF THE INCAPACITY FOR WORK OF A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNE FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS THE COMMUNE SHALL BE BOUND TO RENDER HIM ASSISTANCE DURING THIS TIME BY WORKING HIS LAND IN COMMON
SHORT LOGS FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD-PILE WERE BEING BUILT UP ALONG THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING TO FORM BREASTWORKS
I KNOW WHERE THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION IS HIDING HE SAID
I WISH TO SPEAK MERELY OF GOVERNMENTAL LOGIC WITHOUT TOUCHING THE QUESTIONS OF THE HONOUR AND DIGNITY OF THE STATE
THEY MUST GIVE US FOOD AND BOOTS AND REINFORCEMENTS OR SOON THERE WILL BE LEFT ONLY EMPTY TRENCHES
AMONG THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BOOK ARE
THE COMMISSAR OF MARINE WAS BROKE
OTHER THAN THAT THE BOURGEOISIE LAY LOW BIDING ITS HOUR--WHICH COULD NOT FAR OFF
SEPTEMBER 6TH AT 9 O'CLOCK THE CAMP WAS ENTIRELY OCCUPIED
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND COSSACKS FINALLY FOLLOWED HIM
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WHICH MARCH AGAINST US WERE ISOLATED ARE ISOLATED AND FOREVER CUT OFF FROM THE PROLETARIAT
THE WILDEST UPROAR FOLLOWED
AS ONE SOVIET OFFICIAL TOLD ME WHENEVER WE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE YUNKERS AND WHITE GUARDS WERE WE BOMBARDED THEIR POCKETBOOKS AT THE BIG HOTEL NATIONAL THEY FINALLY TOOK US IN
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES WANTED AN ASSURANCE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PRESS FOR PEACE
ON THE STEPS STOOD BOY-SCOUTS AND OFFICERS DISTRIBUTING COPIES OF THE SOLDATSKI GOLOS A WORKMAN WITH A RED BAND AROUND HIS ARM AND A REVOLVER IN HIS HAND STOOD TREMBLING WITH RAGE AND NERVOUSNESS IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOSTILE THRONG AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE PAPERS
15
DURING THE LAST WEEK IN NOVEMBER A DECREE WAS ISSUED BY THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS CHANGING THE NAME OF THE WINTER PALACE TO PEOPLE'S MUSEUM ENTRUSTING IT TO THE COMPLETE CHARGE OF THE ARTISTIC-ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMMISSION AND DECLARING THAT HENCEFORTH ALL GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES WITHIN ITS WALL WERE PROHIBITED
IN SOME OF THE COMMITTEE-ROOMS PEOPLE LAY SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR THEIR GUNS BESIDE THEM
150 SOLDIERS WHO REMAINED IN THE CAMP OPENED FIRE WITH MACHINE-GUNS THAT NIGHT
BACK NORTHWARD THE CLOUDS ROLLED AWAY DRAMATICALLY AND THE PALE SUN CAME OUT
ECHOES OF THE BURTZEV-VERKHOVSKI AFFAIR
ONLY A GOVERNMENT FORMED BY THIS PARTY CAN THEREFORE BE A SOVIET GOVERNMENT
THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION THE DUMA THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY--PROUDLY CLAIMING KERENSKY AS A MEMBER--ALL PASSIONATELY PROTESTED THAT HE COULD ONLY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
IT SEEMS EVEN THAT THEY WANT TO FORM A NEW POWER AGAINST THE SOVIETS
FROM THEN ON UNTIL DARK THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE PACKED TRAIN JOLTING AND STOPPING AND OCCASIONAL STATIONS WHERE A RAVENOUS MOB SWOOPED DOWN ON THE SCANTILY-FURNISHED BUFFET AND SWEPT IT CLEAN
THE RIGHT IS RESERVED TO RETIRE FROM THE SERVICE ALL COMMANDERS ON ACTIVE SERVICE WHO ARE NOT ELECTED BY THE SOLDIERS TO ANY POST AND WHO CONSEQUENTLY ARE RANKED AS PRIVATES
AND IN ALL THESE COUNTRIES THERE WAS THE BEGINNING OF A BITTER STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE LOCAL SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
AND WITH THE SHOUT LONG LIVE THE END OF CIVIL WAR
PREOBRAZHENSKY V
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FINANCE COUNCIL FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF THE AUTHORISATIONS INDICATED IN CLAUSE 3 WILL HOLD THEIR OFFICE IN THE BUILDING OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE ILYINKA STREET FROM 10 A
IN THE ALEXANDER HALL A MONSTER MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
THE LAND AND DESERTERS THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT FORCED TO MAKE ANY DECISION CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF DESERTERS TO THE LAND
THEY EXPLAINED IT WAS TO MAKE BOOTS WITH
A CONFERENCE OF ARTISTS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS HELD AT THE SUGGESTION OF SMOLNY APPOINTED A COMMISSION OF MAKE AN INVENTORY OF THE WINTER PALACE TREASURES WHICH WAS GIVEN COMPLETE CHARGE OF THE PALACE AND OF ALL ARTISTIC COLLECTIONS AND STATE MUSEUMS IN PETROGRAD
IN THE IMPORTANT CENTRES OF PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW WHERE THE SOVIETS WERE BEST ORGANISED THEY DID NOT TAKE IN ALL THE DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS
THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY PLOTTERS ARE PLANNING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INSURRECTION TO DESTROY THE REVOLUTION OPEN THE FRONT TO WILHELM AND WRECK THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
SHUT UP
CHOOSE THEN COSSACKS FOR WHOM WILL YOU STAND
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE BROKEN WINDOWS WE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE SMOTHERED DURING THE NIGHT
IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN IT THE GOVERNMENT WILL TAKE ENERGETIC MEASURES A COMMISSION COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF ALL PARTIES WAS IMMEDIATELY APPOINTED AND WITH THE MAYOR SENT TO PETER PAUL TO INVESTIGATE
HE NAMED AS ASSISTANTS TWO MEN NO LESS UNPOPULAR RUTENBURG AND PALTCHINSKY
ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING WE DREW OUT OF THE STATION AN IMMENSE LONG TRAIN DRAWN BY A WEAK LITTLE LOCOMOTIVE BURNING WOOD AND STUMBLED ALONG SLOWLY WITH MANY STOPS
THIS WAS NOT ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI HOWEVER
THAT WILL BE DECIDED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF OUR ALLIES
ONLY TWO MONTHS BEFORE CONSIDERED AN EXTREME REVOLUTIONIST AND VERY POPULAR WITH THE PEASANTS HE WAS NOW CALLED TO CHECK THE DANGEROUS DRIFT OF THE CONGRESS TOWARD THE LEFT
2A
WHEN BOLSHEVIK COMMISSARS ENTERED THE CLERKS LEFT SECRETING THE BOOKS AND REMOVING THE FUNDS
BESIDE THEM LAY A COPY OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE'S LAST BULLETIN UPSIDE DOWN SCRAWLED WITH PAINFUL HAND-WRITING
WHAT'S THE MATTER THEY ASKED
I STOPPED KAMENIEV--A QUICK MOVING LITTLE MAN WITH A WIDE VIVACIOUS FACE SET CLOSE TO HIS SHOULDERS
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT APPOINTED BY THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS RECEIVED THE NAME OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THAT ALL ILLUSIONS ABOUT COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOISIE WERE HENCEFORTH DEMONSTRATED VAIN
THEY SPEAK OF THE NECESSITY FOR A COALITION
EITHER WE MUST ABANDON OUR SLOGAN ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS HE WROTE OR ELSE WE MUST MAKE AN INSURRECTION
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY NOTICE IS ACCUSING THE WORKERS OF THE STATE AND PRIVATE BANKING AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF IMPEDING THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED TOWARDS THE ENSURING OF THE FRONT WITH PROVISIONS COMRADES AND CITIZENS DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CALUMNY BROUGHT AGAINST US WHO ARE PART OF THE GENERAL ARMY OF LABOUR
WHY YES HE ANSWERED FINALLY LOOKING THE OTHER UP AND DOWN WITH AN EXPRESSION OF GREAT FRIENDLINESS
I PICKED UP A COPY OF THE PAPER AND UNDER A FLEETING STREET-LIGHT READ
FOR TRANSLATION SEE APP
FOR TRANSLATION SEE APP
FOR TRANSLATION SEE APP
FOR TRANSLATION SEE APP
AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE PERSONNEL OF THE DUMA MAJORITY ALTHOUGH HAVING LOST ALL POLITICAL FOLLOWING CONTINUES TO MAKE USE OF ITS PREROGATIVES TO RESIST IN A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY MANNER THE WILL OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS TO SABOTAGE AND OBSTRUCT THE NORMAL WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT--THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS CONSIDERS IT ITS DUTY TO INVITE THE POPULATION OF THE CAPITAL TO PRONOUNCE JUDGMENT ON THE POLICY OF THE ORGAN OF MUNICIPAL AUTONOMY
DOLBY GO AHEAD
THE USE OF THE LAND SHOULD BE EQUALISED--THAT IS TO SAY THE LAND SHALL BE DIVIDED AMONG THE WORKERS ACCORDING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS THE UNIT OF LABOUR AND THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
ACCORDING TO THEIR INTERPRETATION THE RUSSIAN MASSES WERE NOT EDUCATED ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER THE POWER
THEY TOO HAD THEIR POCKETS FULL OF SMALL PLUNDER
THE SO-CALLED PEOPLE'S COUNCIL HE SAID PROPOSED BY THE CONFERENCE WOULD CONSIST OF ABOUT 420 MEMBERS OF WHICH ABOUT 150 WOULD BE BOLSHEVIKI
DELEGATES OF THE ARMY AND THE BALTIC FLEET STOOD UP ALL OVER THE HALL SHOUTING THAT THE SOVIET WAS THEIR GOVERNMENT
4 WERE SIGNIFICANT
THE TSAY-EE-KAH CONSIDERS IT NECESSARY THAT THERE ENTER INTO THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES COMPOSING THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES WHO RECOGNISE THE CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION OF NOVEMBER 7TH--THAT IS TO SAY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A GOVERNMENT OF SOVIETS THE DECREES ON PEACE LAND WORKERS CONTROL OVER INDUSTRY AND THE ARMING OF THE WORKING-CLASS THE TSAY-EE-KAH THEREFORE RESOLVES TO PROPOSE NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ALL PARTIES OF THE SOVIET AND INSISTS UPON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS AS A BASIS
OH YES INTERRUPTED THE OTHER
THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN WAS TO REPLACE THE GARRISON REGIMENTS WITH DEPENDABLE TROOPS--COSSACKS DEATH BATTALIONS
GRADUAL DISARMAMENT BOTH ON LAND AND SEA AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MILITIA SYSTEM
ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE STAFF ARE APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND CONFIRMED BY THE RESPECTIVE CONGRESSES
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION
SKRIPNIK FOR THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES
I TELL YOU NOW THE LETTISH SOLDIERS HAVE MANY TIMES SAID NO MORE RESOLUTIONS
WE OFFERED THE VLADIMIR YUNKERS A CHANCE TO SURRENDER HE SAID
THE MORNING PAPERS ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD SUPPRESSED THE PAPERS NOVAYA RUS ZHIVOYE SLOVO RABOTCHI PUT AND SOLDAT AND DECREED THE ARREST OF THE LEADERS OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND THE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
BUT OVER THESE HUNG CRUDELY-LETTERED SIGNS EVIDENCE OF THE VITALITY OF THE NEW ORDER
IS IT TRUE THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE FLED TO THE BATTLESHIP AVRORA THEY SAY SO ONLY THE WALLS SCREAMED AND THE FEW NEWSPAPERS
THE REVOLUTION IS WINNING--THE REVOLUTION HAS WON
BOTH FINLAND AND UKRAINE WERE BEGINNING SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GERMANS AND WERE PROMPTLY RECOGNISED BY THE ALLIED GOVERNMENTS WHICH LOANED THEM HUGE SUMS OF MONEY JOINING WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES TO CREATE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CENTRES OF ATTACK UPON SOVIET RUSSIA
BUT COMRADES
YOU HAVE BEEN BADLY TREATED HE SAID
NEXT TO ME SAT A YOUTH WITH THE SHOULDER-STRAPS OF A LIEUTENANT WHO SEEMED TO SPEAK ALL EUROPEAN LANGUAGES WITH EQUAL FLUENCY
KAZAN SARATOV NOVGOROD VINNITZA--WHERE THE STREETS HAD RUN WITH BLOOD
NO POWER CAN DEFEAT THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTION
TO-DAY DAN IS ACCUSED OF HAVING MADE A SPEECH IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH PROVES HIM TO BE A SECRET BOLSHEVIK
THERE IS NOT A SHADOW OF HESITATION IN THE MASSES OF PETROGRAD MOSCOW AND THE REST OF RUSSIA
MY CUP IS FULL
RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY TACTICS ARE BEST AS WE LEFT THE WORKERS IN THE PIT EXHAUSTED AND RUNNING WITH SWEAT IN SPITE OF THE COLD BEGAN TO CLIMB WEARILY OUT
THERE WERE STILL ISOLATED CASES OF DEFIANCE TOWARD THE NEW GOVERNMENT BUT THEY WERE RARE
THE REVOLUTION IS IN DANGER
THEN TROTZKY AGAIN FIERY INDEFATIGABLE GIVING ORDERS ANSWERING QUESTIONS

HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT ALL KERENSKYS
WHAT WOULD THE BOLSHEVIKI DO
BUT YOU HAVE A HIGHLY DEVELOPED CAPITALIST CLASS
IT WAS ALMOST TWO HOURS AND A HALF LATER THAT THE DELEGATES CAME STRAGGLING BACK THE PRESIDIUM MOUNTED THE PLATFORM AND THE SESSION RECOMMENCED BY THE READING OF TELEGRAMS FROM REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT ANNOUNCING THEIR ADHESION TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
SOMEBODY SAID GLANCING CARELESSLY AT HIM THAT HE WAS A MINISTER OR SOMETHING
THE WORKING-CLASS OUGHT TO--MUST--SHOW IN THESE DAYS THE GREATEST FIRMNESS AND ENDURANCE IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE EXECUTION OF ALL THE AIMS OF THE NEW PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT OF SOVIETS
WIR NACH DIE KASERNEN ZU ESSEN GEHEN I MADE OUT THAT THERE WOULD BE LUNCH AT SOME BARRACKS
LATE IN THE EVENING I WENT TO THE DVORIANSKOYE SOBRANIE_--THE NOBLES CLUB--WHERE THE MOSCOW BOLSHEVIKI WERE TO MEET AND CONSIDER THE REPORT OF NOGIN RYKOV AND THE OTHERS WHO HAD LEFT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
AH HE KEPT SAYING IT IS NOT THE DANGER OR THE HARDSHIPS I MIND BUT BEING SO LONG THREE YEARS AWAY FROM MY MOTHER LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE TRAIN AS WE SPED THROUGH THE COLD DARK TOWARD PETROGRAD I CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF CLUMPS OF SOLDIERS GESTICULATING IN THE LIGHT OF FIRES AND OF CLUSTERS OF ARMOURED CARS HALTED TOGETHER AT CROSS-ROADS THE CHAUFFEURS HANGING OUT OF THE TURRETS AND SHOUTING TO EACH OTHER
IN THIS HALL WE SWEAR TO WORKERS OF ALL LANDS TO REMAIN AT OUR REVOLUTIONARY POST
AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION THE COOPERATIVES SPREAD RAPIDLY AND WERE DOMINATED BY POPULIST SOCIALISTS MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND ACTED AS A CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL FORCE UNTIL THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION
4 THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE BOLSHEVIKI HOWEVER DID NOT BRING TRANQUILLITY TO THE ILL-FATED COUNCIL
GRAPHIC PAGE 184
MY NAME IS TROTZKY YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PASS ANSWERED THE SOLDIER STUBBORNLY
AT SEVASTOPOL THE LOCAL SOVIET HAD ASSUMED THE POWER
BUT WE DECLARE THAT AS THE PARTY OF THE MAJORITY AT THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS WE ARE ENTITLED AND BOUND BEFORE THE PEOPLE TO FORM A GOVERNMENT
NOW YOU ARE OPPOSING KERENSKY
THEY LEAD THE MASSES ON A FALSE TRAIL DECEIVING THEM AS TO THE SOURCE OF ALL THEIR TROUBLES
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION CHAPTER IX VICTORY ORDER NUMBER I TO THE TROOPS OF THE PULKOVO DETACHMENT

OFF THAT WAY HE WAVED HIS ARM VAGUELY WESTWARD
I WILL WRITE YOU CREDENTIALS HE WENT TO THE TYPEWRITER AND SLOWLY PICKED OUT THE LETTERS
FOR THE MOMENT THEY WERE LIFTED OUT OF THE ORDINARY RUN OF COMMON THOUGHTS THINKING IN TERMS OF RUSSIA OF SOCIALISM THE WORLD AS IF IT DEPENDED ON THEM WHETHER THE REVOLUTION WERE TO LIVE OR DIE
LUNACHARSKY
APPROVES OF THE PROVISIONAL WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC ESTABLISHED BY THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
HE WOULD ENTER THE CITY TO-MORROW--IN A FEW HOURS
HE WAS PLAINLY FOR THE SOVIETS BUT BEWILDERED
STREET-FIGHTING WAS SLOWLY GATHERING WAY
CHILDREN WITH BUNDLES OF FOOD FOR THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS
2 ALL FUNCTIONARIES ELECTED OR APPOINTED BY THE PRESENT DUMA SHALL REMAIN AT THEIR POSTS AND FULFIL THE DUTIES CONFIDED TO THEM UNTIL THEIR PLACES SHALL BE FILLED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NEW DUMA
A FEW WORKMEN SOME SOLDIERS AND THE REST SHOP-KEEPERS CLERKS AND THE LIKE
THE POWERS REMAIN SILENT
AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRST ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCE OF FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES SEE APP
IN THE IMMENSE WHITE MEETING-ROOM THE TSAY-EE-KAH WAS WAITING WITH THE WHOLE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND A THOUSAND SPECTATORS BESIDE WITH THAT SOLEMNITY WHICH ATTENDS GREAT CONSCIOUS MOMENTS IN HISTORY
ONLY A GOVERNMENT COMPOSED OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES HE SAID COULD POSSESS THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE SUCH IMPORTANT ACTION
I CLIMBED UP TO THEM
HE WHO NOW TALKS ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS GOES BACKWARD AND HALTS OUR HEADLONG COURSE TOWARD SOCIALISM
ANOTHER VALUABLE RESULT WAS THE BRINGING OF BREAD WHICH HAD BEEN HOARDED BY THE POMIESHTCHIKI TO THE RAILROAD STATIONS IN THAT PROVINCE
THEN THE CAPITALIST CLASS MUST CONTROL THE LEGISLATURES AND THE COURTS
THE BARINI WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND A ROOM IN ANY HOTEL HE SAID
WHY DID AMERICA COME INTO THE WAR
A CORDON OF TROOPS WAS DRAWN ABOUT THE WINTER PALACE
POTRESSOV IN THE MENSHEVIK DIEN DAY PUBLISHED A SENSATIONAL STORY ACCOMPANIED BY A MAP WHICH PROFESSED TO REVEAL THE SECRET BOLSHEVIK PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
1 PEOPLE IN REVOLT HAVE A WAY OF DEFYING MILITARY PRECEDENT
MY PETROGRAD CHAPTER X MOSCOW THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WITH A FIERCE INTENSITY FOLLOWED UP ITS VICTORY
THEIR COMMON AIM IS TO SUPPRESS THE PEOPLE'S SOVIETS TO CRUSH THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS TO INTRODUCE AGAIN THE DISCIPLINE OF THE WHIP IN THE ARMY AND TO ETERNALISE THE BONDAGE OF THE TOILING COSSACKS
THEY TRIED TO SEND A MISSION TO THE STAVKA BUT WE ARRESTED THEM AT MINSK
THE UNION OF THE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WITH BITING SARCASM HE WENT ON TO SPEAK OF THE ALLIED DIPLOMATS TILL THEN CONTEMPTUOUS OF RUSSIA'S INVITATION TO AN ARMISTICE WHICH HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE CENTRAL POWERS
A SECOND EDITION OF THE EVENTS OF JULY 16-18 OR THEY WILL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WITH THEIR PLANS AND INTENTIONS WITH THEIR IMPERTINENT POLICY OF WISHING TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM EVERYTHING CONSCIOUSLY NATIONAL THEY HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY DEFEATED
THE BUILDING BY COLLECTIVE LABOUR OF ITS OWN GENERAL RICH AND FREE SOUL
THINK OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RUSSIAN MEN STARING UP AT SPEAKERS ALL OVER THE VAST COUNTRY WORKMEN PEASANTS SOLDIERS SAILORS TRYING SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND TO CHOOSE THINKING SO INTENSELY--AND DECIDING SO UNANIMOUSLY AT THE END
SCORES OF THESE PRETENDED AMBULANCES ACTED AS COURIERS AND AMMUNITION TRAINS FOR THE YUNKERS FIVE OR SIX ARMOURED CARS BELONGING TO THE DISBANDED BRITISH ARMOURED CAR DIVISION WERE IN THEIR HANDS
A MINUTE AGO WE GOT WORD FROM A REGIMENT THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO COME TO PETROGRAD
THE GOVERNMENT IS NO LONGER A POWER
ALL ATTEMPTS AT COMPROMISE HAD FAILED
THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THE CASE OF RIGA
HE WILL DESTROY THE COUNTRY
BOTH SIDES PARLEYED AWAITING THE RESULT IN THE CAPITAL
THEY ARE NOW IN PETER-PAUL FORTRESS
WE THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES ARE GOING TO TRY AN EXPERIMENT UNIQUE IN HISTORY
ALL THE ENTRANCES TO THE PALACE SQUARE WERE CLOSED BY SENTRIES AND A CORDON OF TROOPS STRETCHED CLEAR ACROSS THE WESTERN END BESIEGED BY AN UNEASY THRONG OF CITIZENS
EVERYTHING WILL BE SO DEAR AS TO MAKE LIFE IMPOSSIBLE
OPPOSITION TO THESE MEASURES IS A CRIME AGAINST THE PEOPLE
DOUBLE ROWS OF SENTRIES GUARDED THE OUTER GATES AND ONCE INSIDE THE FRONT DOOR THERE WAS A LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WAITING TO BE LET IN FOUR AT A TIME TO BE QUESTIONED AS TO THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR BUSINESS
THE GREAT HOUR FOR THE SALVATION OF THE REVOLUTION HAS ARRIVED AND IN CONSCIOUSNESS THEREOF WE OBSERVE THE CLOSE UNION OF THE LIVE FORCES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY BY WHOSE ORGANISED WILL A CENTRE FOR THE SALVATION OF THE COUNTRY AND THE REVOLUTION HAS ALREADY BEEN CREATED AND MUCH OF THE SAME SORT
ALL FACTIONS EXCEPT THE FEW BOLSHEVIKI HAVE LEFT THE CONGRESS
AN INSURRECTION HOWEVER WOULD PREPARE THE WAY FOR A NEW KORNILOV
SOME SAILORS AMBUSHED BEHIND WOOD-PILES BEGAN SHOOTING
I'VE HEARD THE NAME SOMEWHERE HE SAID AT LENGTH
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS MEETING CONTINUOUSLY AT SMOLNY A CENTRE OF STORM DELEGATES FALLING DOWN ASLEEP ON THE FLOOR AND RISING AGAIN TO TAKE PART IN THE DEBATE TROTZKY KAMENIEV VOLODARSKY SPEAKING SIX EIGHT TWELVE HOURS A DAY
MANY OF THEM WERE WOMEN--SQUAT STRONG PROLETARIAN WOMEN
ALL THOSE WHO HAVE FELT OR KNOW HOW TO FEEL REVOLUTIONARY ENTHUSIASM MUST JOIN NOW FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE REVOLUTION
THE BOURGEOISIE SHOULD HAVE BETTER KNOWN ITS RUSSIA
UNDER THE HIGH DARK SKY A COLD WIND SMELT OF SNOW
THE GERM OF ALL OUR EVILS COMES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW ORIGINAL TRULY RUSSIAN CONCERNING FOREIGN POLICY WHICH PASSES FOR THE INTERNATIONALIST POINT OF VIEW
UNION OF SOCIALIST SOLDIERS CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN TRADE UNIONS FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE
UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN THE PROVINCE TO WHICH HE IS ACCREDITED THE EMISSARY SHOULD CALL A JOINT MEETING OF THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES TO WHOM HE SHOULD MAKE A REPORT ON THE AGRARIAN LAWS AND THEN DEMAND THAT A JOINT PLENARY SESSION OF THE SOVIETS BE SUMMONED
SO WE BEGAN TO DO IT
THE REMAINING SUMS ARE TO BE ENTERED ON CURRENT ACCOUNT PAYMENTS ON WHICH ARE TO BE MADE IN THE ORDER ESTABLISHED BY THE PRESENT DECREE
BE ON GUARD
AS WE SAT THERE THE CHAIRMAN READ A LIST OF NAMES AND ASSIGNMENTS
ARRIVED AT NARVSKAYA ZASTAVA ABOUT TEN MILES OUT ANTONOV CALLED FOR THE COMMANDANT OF THE RED GUARD
ON CURRENT ACCOUNTS AND ON THE BOOKS OF THE SAVINGS BANKS PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE ABOVE MENTIONED INSTITUTIONS OF NOT MORE THAN 150 RUBLES FOR EACH DEPOSITOR DURING THE COURSE OF THE NEXT WEEK
THE PEASANTS OF TAMBOV AND TVER GOVERNMENTS TIRED OF WAITING FOR THE LAND EXASPERATED BY THE REPRESSIVE MEASURES OF THE GOVERNMENT WERE BURNING MANOR-HOUSES AND MASSACRING LAND-OWNERS
I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT SOVIET TROOPS AND COSSACKS MINGLED IN THE PLACES WHERE THESE CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED
I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO RECONCILE YOU WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BUT AT PRESENT I FEEL FOR YOU NOTHING BUT CONTEMPT THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS WERE ON THEIR FEET SHOUTING ANGRILY ASSAILED BY HOARSE HATEFUL VOICES AND WAVING ARMS
HOWEVER HE WENT ON IN AN UNMOVED VOICE NOBODY WILL DENY THAT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA HAS BEEN FORMED BY THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY HE HAD TO WAIT A MOMENT SO THAT FOR ALL PURPOSES IT IS THE SAME THING HERE THE RIGHT BENCHES BROKE INTO DEAFENING CLAMOUR BUT THE CENTRE AND LEFT WERE CURIOUS AND COMPELLED SILENCE
A SOLDIER LOUNGING ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS IN THE TOP OF HIS TROUSERS LOOKED US UP AND DOWN WITH GLOOMY SUSPICION
IT COVERS THE TIME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ALLIES THE NEGOTIATIONS AND ARMISTICE WITH THE GERMANS AND THE BEGINNING OF THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AT BREST-LITOVSK AS WELL AS THE PERIOD IN WHICH WERE LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SOVIET STATE
WE INSIST UPON THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT WHICH WILL REPRESENT THE ENTIRE DEMOCRACY THE REACTIONARY DELEGATES SHREWDLY FOSTERED THIS FEELING DECLARING IN THE FACE OF PROTESTS FROM THE BOLSHEVIK BENCHES THAT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS INTENDED EITHER TO CONTROL THE CONGRESS OR DISSOLVE IT BY FORCE OF ARMS--AN ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH WAS RECEIVED BY THE PEASANTS WITH BURSTS OF FURY
THERE HAS BEEN A BATTLE
THIS SEEMED TO AMUSE THEM VERY MUCH
ANOTHER SHELL HIT THE CORNER OF IVAN VELIKI
FROM SECRET DOCUMENTS DISCOVERED IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THE ACCOUNT IS NOT STRICTLY ACCURATE
SOON VERY SOON EVEN THE MOST IGNORANT WHO HAVE BEEN HELD IN IGNORANCE SO LONG WILL AWAKE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT A SOURCE OF JOY STRENGTH AND WISDOM IS ART 3
SQUADS OF SOLDIERS MARCHING OUT OF STEP WITH AN AFFECTIONATE JEER FOR THE RED GUARDS
TOWARD THE END THE CRIES AND HISSES DIED AWAY AND WHEN HE FINISHED THERE WAS EVEN SOME CLAPPING
THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITIONS OF THE VICTORY OF THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION WHICH ALONE WILL SECURE THE LASTING SUCCESS AND THE COMPLETE REALISATION OF THE LAND DECREE IS THE CLOSE UNION OF THE PEASANT-WORKERS WITH THE INDUSTRIAL WORKING-CLASS WITH THE PROLETARIAT OF ALL ADVANCED COUNTRIES
ITS HISTORY IS MERELY AN EXPANDED VERSION OF THE HISTORY OF THE EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE AT FIRST THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE DELEGATES WERE HOSTILE TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AND SUPPORTED THE REACTIONARY WING
DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE PEASANTS WILL IMMEDIATELY REALISE THAT IT IS ALL A TRICK--THAT THESE USURPERS HAVE STOLEN THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMME I ASKED IF IT WERE TRUE THAT KALEDIN WAS MARCHING NORTH
BUT THERE WAS A FAINT SOUND OF STIRRING FAR AND NEAR LIKE A DEEP WIND COMING
COME OVER TO THE RANK OF THE VICTORIOUS PEOPLE
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IS ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS
THEY HAVE ACTED IN ACCORD WITH KERENSKY AND THE BOURGEOISIE
THE RIGHT OF PRIVATEERING TO BE ABOLISHED
AVILOV WITH HIS YOUNG INTELLIGENT FACE LOOKING OUT OF PLACE IN HIS SMART FROCK-COAT
WHEN WE CAME INTO THE CHILL NIGHT ALL THE FRONT OF SMOLNY WAS ONE HUGE PARK OF ARRIVING AND DEPARTING AUTOMOBILES ABOVE THE SOUND OF WHICH COULD BE HEARD THE FAR-OFF SLOW BEAT OF THE CANNON
TOWARD FOUR IN THE MORNING I MET ZORIN IN THE OUTER HALL A RIFLE SLUNG FROM HIS SHOULDER
TRUSISHKA BOUGHT THE PROVISIONS
THIS WILL BECOME MUCH CLEARER TO YOU IF YOU WILL RECOLLECT THAT I AM A MEMBER OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH AND THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT OUR PARTY COMRADES ARE IN THE WINTER PALACE UNDER BOMBARDMENT SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO EXECUTE THE DUTY PUT ON THEM BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH CONFUSED UPROAR I DECLARE THE FIRST SESSION OF THE SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES OPEN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDIUM TOOK PLACE AMID STIR AND MOVING ABOUT
THE ARMY IS WITH US
THE DOCUMENTS PROVING PRO-GERMAN CONSPIRACY WERE DISCOVERED TO BE FORGERIES;[1 AND ONE BY ONE THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON WITHOUT TRIAL ON NOMINAL OR NO BAIL-UNTIL ONLY SIX REMAINED
THE CITY MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO CLEAR THESE PLACES BUT FOUND THE OFFICES BARRICADED AND ARMED MEN DEFENDING THEM
THE NEW COMMANDANT OF TSARSKOYE SELO AND I WENT TOWARD THE EKATERINA PALACE BAKLANOV VERY EXCITED AND IMPORTANT
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE AND THE TSAY-EE-KAH MALKIN SAID THE NEWS FROM MOSCOW WHERE OUR COMRADES ARE DYING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BARRICADES DETERMINES US TO BRING UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF ORGANISATION OF POWER AND IT IS NOT ONLY OUR RIGHT TO DO SO BUT OUR DUTY
PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT NATIONS
IN THE FIELDS ON EITHER SIDE WOMEN AND OLD MEN WERE DIGGING TRENCHES AND STRINGING BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS

1 ON THE CORNER OF THE MORSKAYA I RAN INTO CAPTAIN GOMBERG MENSHEVIK OBORONETZ SECRETARY OF THE MILITARY SECTION OF HIS PARTY
THEY HAD DEMANDED THAT THE ALLIES HOLD A CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS WAR-AIMS
THE IZVOSHTCHIKI CAME BACK THE PEOPLE LYING DOWN STOOD UP
SCORES OF DELEGATES FROM THE FRONT HAVE HASTENED TO PETROGRAD TO ASSURE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF THE ARMY'S FIDELITY
THEN THE THREE STROKES OF THE BELL AND WE MADE A RUSH FOR THE TRAIN WORMING OUR WAY THROUGH THE PACKED AND NOISY AISLE
IT WAS A MATTER OF PARTY DISCIPLINE
THIS KERENSKY IS NOTHING BUT A SHIELD TO THE POMIESHTCHIKI LANDOWNERS HE CRIED
IN THE STORMY DEBATES ON THE LAND QUESTION AND THE LENIN RESOLUTION THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE TWICE ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ASSEMBLY BOTH TIMES RESTRAINED BY THEIR LEADERS
ON THE OTHER HAND ARMED WORKERS PATROLLED THE STREETS AT NIGHT DOING BATTLE WITH MARAUDERS AND REQUISITIONING ARMS WHEREVER THEY FOUND THEM
THE DISTRICT SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES SHALL TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE STRICTEST ORDER DURING THE TAKING OVER OF THE LAND-OWNERS ESTATES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PLOTS OF LAND AND WHICH OF THEM ARE SUBJECT TO CONFISCATION FOR THE DRAWING UP OF AN INVENTORY OF THE ENTIRE CONFISCATED PROPERTY AND FOR THE STRICTEST REVOLUTIONARY PROTECTION OF ALL THE FARMING PROPERTY ON THE LAND WITH ALL BUILDINGS IMPLEMENTS CATTLE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTS ETC PASSING INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE
THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES TSAY-EE-KAH HAS AT ALL TIMES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL ALTER OR ANNUL ANY OF THE GOVERNMENT DECREES
THIS I TREAT AT LENGTH IN THE NEXT VOLUME KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK 19
AND AT THE STATION OF PEREDOLSK WERE MET BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FIFTH BATTALION FROM TSARSKOYE

IF IT EXPRESSED A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HE BEGGED AVKSENTIEV TO FORM A NEW CABINET
PODVOISKY
PODVOISKY
FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS SAID PRINTED THAT THE RED GUARDS HAD NOT ONLY THOROUGHLY LOOTED THE WINTER PALACE BUT THAT THEY HAD MASSACRED THE YUNKERS AFTER DISARMING THEM HAD KILLED SOME OF THE MINISTERS IN COLD BLOOD
DECENTRALISATION THE STATE COMMISSION ON PEOPLE'S EDUCATION IS BY NO MEANS A CENTRAL POWER GOVERNING THE INSTITUTIONS OF INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MUCH-TALKED-OF BOLSHEVIK VYSTUPLENNIE HE SHRUGGED SNEERING
OUR CAR WAS FULL OF COMMUTERS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE GOING HOME LADEN WITH BUNDLES AND EVENING PAPERS
THAT THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS ARE BEING ENERGETICALLY ORGANISED IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT
IN ALL THE STORES OF THE LARGE CITIES WERE TONS OF FOOD AND CLOTHING
KERENSKY TRIED TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE CADETS PARTY OF THE BOURGEOISIE
IT IS A QUESTION OF THE FREE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHETHER HE WILL OR WILL NOT TAKE PART IN THIS PROCESSION
KAMENIEV WAS READING THE DECREE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF POWER
AND OTHERS INTERMINABLY SPEAKING OUT OF FULL HEARTS WITH THE HAPPY ELOQUENCE OF HOPES FULFILLED
IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE LEAST INTERFERENCE WITH EXISTING ARMY ORGANISATIONS CAN BRING ON IRREPARABLE MISFORTUNES BY OPENING THE FRONT TO THE ENEMY
AND SINCE THE POPULAR WILL HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS THE POPULAR WILL WHICH CAN CREATE A GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY CONCENTRATED IN THE DUMA AFTER OTHER SPEAKERS OF WHICH ONLY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS WAS IN FAVOUR OF CONSIDERING THE ADMISSION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE DUMA VOTED TO CONTINUE ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE VIKZHEL'S CONFERENCE BUT TO INSIST UPON THE RESTORATION OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE EVERYTHING AND TO EXCLUDE THE BOLSHEVIKI FROM THE NEW POWER
A SLIGHT MAN WITH THICK GLASSES MAGNIFYING HIS RED-RIMMED EYES HIS SPEECH A PAINFUL EFFORT STOOD LEANING AGAINST A MUD-GUARD WITH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF A SHABBY RAGLAN
TO ALL ARMY COMMITTEES AND ALL SOVIETS OF SOLDIERS DEPUTIES
ALL PERSONS FOUND GUILTY OF HAVING CONCEALED DOCUMENTS OR MONEY OR HAVING SABOTAGED THE REGULATIONS INDICATED IN PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4 WILL BE PUNISHED BY A SENTENCE OF NOT MORE THAN THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AND ALL THEIR PROPERTY WILL BE CONFISCATED
YOU CAN GO ON IN COMRADE IN THE CORRIDOR I MET KARAKHAN MEMBER OF THE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE WHO EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT WOULD BE LIKE
YOU JUST HAVE TO WRITE TWO WORDS
UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS EVERY ATTEMPT TO ORGANISE A DEMONSTRATION IN THESE DAYS ALTHOUGH FOR THE MOST LAUDABLE OBJECT WOULD BE A CRIME
THE FIRST BRIGADE HAD TRIED TO REPLACE ITS OFFICERS WITH SOLDIERS COMMITTEES LIKE THEIR COMRADES AT HOME AND HAD REFUSED AN ORDER TO GO TO SALONIKA DEMANDING TO BE SENT TO RUSSIA
ALL MINOR STREAMS LAKES AND FORESTS ARE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMUNITIES ON CONDITION OF BEING MANAGED BY THE LOCAL ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT
WITHOUT MONEY SAID MENZHINSKY WE ARE HELPLESS
WE FUNCTIONARIES CANNOT TAKE PART IN PLUNDERING THE PEOPLE'S PROPERTY
LENIN AND TROTZKY RUMOUR SAID WERE TO BE EXCLUDED
LISTEN SAYS ROBESPIERRE-TROTZKY TO HIS ASSISTANT MARAT-URITZKY RUN OVER TO THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR'S TELL HIM WE'RE PROPOSING PEACE GO YOURSELF SAYS MARAT-URITZKY
USSPENSKY CATHEDRAL CRUMBLING DOWN
SOME REGIMENTS TALKED FOR DAYS BEFORE THEY DECIDED WHAT TO DO
TELL THE AMERICAN WORKERS TO RISE AND FIGHT FOR THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION THEN CAME PETROVSKY SLIGHT SLOW-VOICED IMPLACABLE
ALL ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO KERENSKY WILL BE PUNISHED AS A SERIOUS CRIME AGAINST THE STATE WITH BRAKES RELEASED THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHIRLED THROWING OFF ORDERS APPEALS DECREES LIKE SPARKS
HOW MANY COSSACKS ARE THERE WHO HAVE MORE THAN 4-5 DESSIATINS PER HEAD
CONFORMING TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COSSACKS YUNKERS SOLDIERS SAILORS AND WORKERS IT HAS BEEN DECIDED TO ARRAIGN ALEXANDER FEODORVITCH KERENSKY BEFORE A TRIBUNAL OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE ALEXANDER HALL OF THE DUMA BUILDING THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION WAS IN SPECIAL SESSION
YOU WERE ONE OF THE COMMITTEE WHO REFUSED TO SURRENDER THE STAFF WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON
WE STROLLED TOWARD THE IMPERIAL PALACES ALONG THE EDGE OF THE VAST DARK GARDENS THEIR FANTASTIC PAVILIONS AND ORNAMENTAL BRIDGES LOOMING UNCERTAINLY IN THE NIGHT AND SOFT WATER SPLASHING FROM THE FOUNTAINS
THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE PASSED LAST NIGHT TO THE OFFENSIVE
THE AMOUNT OF LAND RECEIVED BY EACH PEASANT WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE LOCALITY
BUT WE HOPE THAT REVOLUTION WILL SOON BREAK OUT IN ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES
THE LEAVES WERE GONE AND THE TREE-TRUNKS WERE A PALE WAN COLOUR IN THE LOW SICKLY AUTUMN SUN
THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT
YESTERDAY KERENSKY
THIS IS IT
THE COSSACK GOVERNMENT DECLARES THAT IT CONSIDERS THESE ACTS CRIMINAL AND ABSOLUTELY INADMISSIBLE
CITIZENS YOU MUST SUPPORT THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
YOU WILL SEE THEN THAT NOT IN VAIN HAS BEEN THE WORK OF THOSE WHOM YOU CALL GERMAN AGENTS OF THOSE ZIMMERWALDISTS[7 WHO IN ALL THE LANDS HAVE PREPARED THE AWAKENING OF THE CONSCIENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC MASSES 7 MEMBERS OF THE REVOLOUTIONARY INTERNATIONALIST WING OF THE SOCIALISTS OF EUROPE SO-CALLED BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE HELD AT ZIMMERWALD SWITZERLAND IN 1915
AN ALLIED DIPLOMAT WHOSE NAME I PROMISED NOT TO MENTION CONFIRMED THIS FROM HIS OWN KNOWLEDGE
AND AS FOR THE WOMAN SOLDIERS MOST OF THEM HAD BEEN VIOLATED AND MANY HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE OF THE TORTURES THEY HAD GONE THROUGH
THE GAME IS ON HE SAID AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
FINALLY THE INCREASING REVOLUTIONARY FEELING OF PEASANTS FORCED THE ESSAIRES TO ABANDON THE COMPENSATION CLAUSE AND LED TO THE YOUNGER AND MORE FIERY INTELLECTUALS BREAKING OFF FROM THE MAIN PARTY IN THE FALL OF 1917 AND FORMING A NEW PARTY THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY THE ESSAIRES WHO WERE AFTERWARD ALWAYS CALLED BY THE RADICAL GROUPS RIGHT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES ADOPTED THE POLITICAL ATTITUDE OF THE MENSHEVIKI AND WORKED TOGETHER WITH THEM
THEY ROLLED ALONG TORRENT-LIKE COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS BORNE WITH THEM GUNS MOTOR-TRUCKS WAGONS--THE REVOLUTIONARY PROLETARIAT DEFENDING WITH ITS BREAST THE CAPITAL OF THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS REPUBLIC
THE MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FULFIL THEIR DUTY REMAIN AT THEIR POST AND CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THE GOOD OF THE FATHERLAND THE REESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER AND THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY FUTURE SOVEREIGN OF RUSSIA AND OF ALL THE RUSSIAN PEOPLES
FROM THE FARTHEST CORNERS OF GREAT RUSSIA WHEREUPON DESPERATE STREET-FIGHTING BURST LIKE A WAVE NEWS OF KERENSKY'S DEFEAT CAME ECHOING BACK THE IMMENSE ROAR OF PROLETARIAN VICTORY
THE FRIGHTENED CITIZENS WERE CREEPING OUT OF THEIR CELLARS TO SEEK THEIR DEAD
I AM UNABLE TO ENDURE THESE HORRORS
TERESTCHENKO OFFERED TO RESIGN
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY NOVEMBER 16TH THE CONGRESS MET IN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION
DUKHONIN ANSWERED THAT HE COULD NOT UNLESS IT EMANATED FROM A GOVERNMENT SUSTAINED BY THE ARMY AND THE COUNTRY BY TELEGRAPH HE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED FROM THE POST OF SUPREME COMMANDER AND KRYLENKO APPOINTED IN HIS PLACE
ON THE OTHER HAND THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE WANTED REAL INDUSTRIAL AND AGRARIAN DEMOCRACY
HE FOUND VERY FEW EXCEPT OURS AND AFTER A HALF-HOUR OF FUTILE WRANGLING LIFTED HIS ARMS DESPAIRINGLY AND WITHDREW
THE SOVIET EXPRESSES ITS FIRM CONVICTION THAT THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT WHICH AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SOVIETS WILL BE CREATED BY THE REVOLUTION AND WHICH WILL ASSURE THE INDUSTRIAL PROLETARIAT OF THE SUPPORT OF THE ENTIRE MASS OF POOR PEASANTS WILL MARCH FIRMLY TOWARD SOCIALISM THE ONLY MEANS BY WHICH THE COUNTRY CAN BE SPARED THE MISERIES AND UNHEARD-OF HORRORS OF WAR
DO NOT COME OUT
INSURRECTION IS THE RIGHT OF ALL REVOLUTIONISTS
THEIR TIME WILL COME
THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS REVOLUTION HAS WON AT PETROGRAD AT MOSCOW
YOU JUST ECHO THEM LIKE A LOT OF PARROTS THE CROWD LAUGHED
TO ACHIEVE THIS THERE MUST BE A POWER CAPABLE OF DARING NOT ONLY BY PERSUASION BUT ALSO BY FORCE
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE DONE WRONG AT THE CORNERS PATROLS STOPPED ALL PASSERSBY--AND THE COMPOSITION OF THESE PATROLS WAS INTERESTING FOR IN COMMAND OF THE REGULAR TROOPS WAS INVARIABLY A RED GUARD
THOSE WHO LEAVE THE SERVICE OF THEIR OWN ACCORD SHALL BE CONSIDERED DISCHARGED
IN THE PERIOD OF IMPERIALISM AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION WHEN THE POWER WAS TRANSFERRED INTO THE HANDS OF THE CADET BOURGEOISIE THE NAKED POLICY OF PROVOCATION GAVE WAY TO ONE OF COWARDLY DISTRUST OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA TO A POLICY OF FAULT-FINDING OF MEANINGLESS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF PEOPLES
THE STRIKE OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES LED BY THE UNION OF UNIONS COLLAPSED DESERTED BY THE FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WHICH HAD BEEN BACKING IT

UPON ORDERS SIGNED BY TROTZKY SEVERAL THOUSAND RIFLES DELIVERED BY THE GOVERNMENT ARMS FACTORY AT SESTRORETZK TO DELEGATES OF THE PETROGRAD WORKMEN
THE FRONT HAS REFUSED TO AID KERENSKY
THE GERMAN KAISER COVERED WITH THE BLOOD OF MILLIONS OF DEAD PEOPLE WANTS TO PUSH HIS ARMY AGAINST PETROGRAD

THE QUESTION OF WAR AND PEACE IS SO CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT I MAY WITHOUT PREAMBLE READ THE PROJECT OF A PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLES OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT COUNTRIES HIS GREAT MOUTH SEEMING TO SMILE OPENED WIDE AS HE SPOKE
SAVINKOV
AT ONE END A DAIS FLANKED WITH TWO TALL MANY-BRANCHED LIGHT STANDARDS AND A GOLD FRAME BEHIND FROM WHICH THE IMPERIAL PORTRAIT HAD BEEN CUT
ALL OTHER BANKING OPERATIONS ARE PROHIBITED DURING THESE THREE DAYS
REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS BOOK RODZIANKO SHULGIN
THE COMMITTEE-ROOMS BUZZED AND HUMMED ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS AND WORKMEN SLEPT ON THE FLOOR WHEREVER THEY COULD FIND ROOM
THERE IS NO RETURN TO THE PAST
AN HOUR LATER GENERAL MANIKOVSKY ACTING MINISTER OF WAR COUNTERMANDED THE OFFER
ALL MEMBERS OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND ALL DELEGATES TO THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS ARE INVITED IMMEDIATELY TO SMOLNY FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY MEETING
EITHER THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WILL CREATE A REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN EUROPE OR THE EUROPEAN POWERS WILL DESTROY THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION THEY GREETED HIM WITH AN IMMENSE CRUSADING ACCLAIM KINDLING TO THE DARING OF IT WITH THE THOUGHT OF CHAMPIONING MANKIND
BOTH SIDES HAD ALREADY AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO THE BASIS OF THE GOVERNMENT
WE PRODUCED THE PASSES FROM SMOLNY
IN THE FRUIT SEASON APPLES AND PEARS SOLD FOR A LITTLE LESS THAN A RUBLE APIECE ON THE STREET-CORNER
THE FLIGHT OF KERENSKY HOWEVER AND THE ASTOUNDING SUCCESS OF THE SOVIETS EVERYWHERE ALTERED THE SITUATION
IN A TWINKLING THE GLOOMY CITY BECAME WHITE DAZZLING
THE ARREST OF ALL PERSONS ENTERING BARRACKS AND INCITING TO ARMED DEMONSTRATIONS AND MASSACRES AND THEIR DELIVERY TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE SECOND COMMANDER OF THE CITY
NO HESITATION OR DOUBTS

THE NEW GOVERNMENT ACTS AND THREATENS IT SPRAYS THE COUNTRY WITH DECREES EACH ONE MORE RADICAL AND MORE SOCIALIST THAN THE LAST
ON THE SAILORS HAT BANDS WERE AVRORA AND ZARIA SVOBODY,_--THE NAMES OF THE LEADING BOLSHEVIK CRUISERS OF THE BALTIC FLEET
TO ME IT SEEMS PERFECTLY SIMPLE--BUT THEN I'M NOT WELL EDUCATED
WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT EXCITED ONLY ABOUT NOVEMBER 2D DATE OF CALLING OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND NOT ABOUT SEPTEMBER 12TH OR OCTOBER 3D
AT THE MEETING OF DECEMBER 2D AN OFFICER AND SOME SAILORS ENTERED THE NICOLAI HALL WHILE A MEMBER WAS SPEAKING AND ORDERED THE MEMBERS TO LEAVE OR FORCE WOULD BE USED
UGH
ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SPECIAL SUPPLY COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE FOOD SITUATION WAS VERY GRAVE AND ASKED THAT EMISSARIES BE SENT OUT TO HASTEN FOOD TRAINS
THEY WERE ALL HUDDLED UP IN A BACK ROOM
THE ARMY MUST BE OUT OF POLITICS
THE SOLDIERS STAYED IN THE BARRACKS THE WORKMEN IN THE FACTORIES
VIKZHEL ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE RAILWAY WORKERS UNION
NEVER 6
THE ORDER WAS ONLY PARTIALLY OBEYED
THEN POSTPONED UNTIL SEPTEMBER
THEY HAVE NO INTELLECTUALS
THE FIFTH ARMY HOWEVER WAS WILD WITH ENTHUSIASM OVER THE NEWS OF THE BOLSHEVIK SUCCESS AND THE ARMY COMMITTEE WAS UNABLE TO PROMISE KERENSKY ANY SUPPORT
GOING UP THE LONG WOODEN SIDEWALK FROM THE OUTER GATE I SAW THE FIRST THIN HESITATING SNOW-FLAKES FLUTTERING DOWN FROM THE GREY WINDLESS SKY
AND THEREUPON THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS WAS DISSOLVED SO THAT THE MEMBERS MIGHT HURRY TO THEIR HOMES IN THE FOUR CORNERS OF RUSSIA AND TELL OF THE GREAT HAPPENINGS
IN LEISURELY MANNER THE MEETING GATHERED MOMENTUM
KRYLENKO MADE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE IMPLORED THE SOLDIERS NOT TO HARM DUKHONIN AS HE WAS TO BE TAKEN TO PETROGRAD AND JUDGED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL
THE TSENTROFLOT REFUSES TO SUBMIT TO THE ORDERS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
IN A LOW VOICE FOR FEAR OF WOUNDING THE COLONEL'S PRIDE BAKLANOV EXPLAINED TO ME
THIS LAST PIECE OF INSOLENCE CAUSED AN OUTBURST OF FURY
AND IN THE LABOUR MARKET THE TRADE UNIONS
HIS EYE FELL FIRST ON THE PRISONER WHO AT ONCE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN
NOW YOU SEE WHAT THESE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE DONE
FOR AN HOUR HAMMER-BLOW AFTER HAMMER-BLOW HAD FALLEN FROM THAT TRIBUNE WELDING THEM TOGETHER BUT BEATING THEM DOWN
TO BELIEVE KERENSKY AND THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC IF THE BOURGEOISIE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE SOVIETS IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CONSTITUENT
THE FACTORY ADMINISTRATION IS OBLIGED TO SURRENDER TO THE ORGANS OF WORKERS CONTROL FOR THEIR AID AND INFORMATION ALL DATA CONCERNING THE BUSINESS
DID THEY STAND THEN ALONE
BUT ANOTHER SOLDIER HOTLY DENOUNCED IT
SUDDENLY THE COMMITTEEMEN AND OFFICERS ON TOP OF THE AUTOMOBILE BEGAN TO DISCUSS SOMETHING WITH GREAT HEAT AND MUCH GESTICULATION
KARAULOV IS SHOOTING THE LOCAL TRIBES IN THE CAUCASUS
CHAPTER XII THE PEASANTS CONGRESS IT WAS ON NOVEMBER 18TH THAT THE SNOW CAME
THE REACTIONARIES WANTED A STRONG IMPERIALIST POLICY
SHRILL EXCITED AS IF WITH A NEW GAME THEY WAITED UNTIL THE FIRING SLACKENED AND THEN TRIED TO RUN ACROSS THE STREET
TO ALL ARMY CORPS DIVISIONAL AND REGIMENTAL COMMITTEES TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES TO ALL ALL ALL
I WENT ACROSS AND SPOKE TO HIM IN FRENCH
THE POLITICAL HYPOCRITES WHO CONTROL THIS CONGRESS HE SHOUTED TOLD US WE WERE TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF POWER--AND IT IS BEING SETTLED BEHIND OUR BACKS BEFORE THE CONGRESS OPENS
FOR DAYS THERE WERE DRUNKEN SOLDIERS ON THE STREETS
TOO MUCH IS AGAINST US
EVIDENTLY HE COULD NOT READ
SEND THIS SAID HE
SUCH VIOLENCE COMMITTED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA AT THE MOMENT OF ITS GREATEST EXTERNAL DANGER IS AN INDESCRIBABLE CRIME AGAINST THE FATHERLAND
TRUCE
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET IS GUARDING THE REVOLUTION
TEESCHE KAMENIEV HASTILY PROPOSED TO LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR DECISION
THE DEPTHS OF RUSSIA HAD BEEN STIRRED AND IT WAS THE BOTTOM WHICH CAME UPPERMOST NOW
THESE MEASURES WERE SUPPORTED BY THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS AND THEIR LEADERS IN THE MINISTRY WHO CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO COOPERATE WITH THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
TWO COMRADES MEANWHILE DETACHED THE CANNON AND SLEWED IT AROUND UNTIL IT AIMED AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE AT OUR BACKS
THE RUSSIAN WORKMAN IS REVOLUTIONARY BUT HE IS NEITHER VIOLENT DOGMATIC NOR UNINTELLIGENT
ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT A STORM OF PROCLAMATIONS POSTED UP HAND-BILLS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE NEWSPAPERS--SCREAMING AND CURSING AND PROPHESYING EVIL
| 1900 | | LEATHER | | | | | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | RUBBERS | PAIR | 2.50 | 15
NOTHING LIKE THIS I IMAGINE EVER OCCURRED IN HISTORY
IT CROWED BRISTLING
THE PETROGRAD GARRISON WILL NOT ALLOW ANY VIOLENCE OR DISORDERS
BUT YOU THE TOILING COSSACKS DO NOT YOU SUFFER YOURSELVES FROM POVERTY OPPRESSION AND LACK OF LAND
WE SEE THAT THIS LEADS DIRECTLY TO THE ELIMINATION FROM POLITICAL LIFE OF MANY PROLETARIAN ORGANISATIONS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IRRESPONSIBLE REGIME AND TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE COUNTRY
AND BY 50 REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TRADE UNIONS 35 FROM THE GENERAL UNIONS 10 RAILWAY WORKERS AND 5 FROM THE POST AND TELEGRAPH WORKERS THE DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS WERE DROPPED
THE ENEMY CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY FORCE
| 1097 | +-------------+---------------+-------------+-------------+----------+ | SOLE | | 20
AS WE LEFT THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ANTONOV ENTERED A PAPER IN HIS HAND LOOKING LIKE A CORPSE
COMRADES THIS IS AN AMERICAN COMRADE
AND THEN IMAGING THE SAME IN ALL THE LOCALS OF EVERY LABOUR UNION IN THE FACTORIES THE VILLAGES ON THE BATTLE-SHIPS OF THE FAR-FLUNG RUSSIAN FLEETS
KARELIN FOLLOWED HIM--ALSO YOUNG FEARLESS WHOSE SINCERITY NO ONE DOUBTED--FOR THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THE PARTY OF MARIA SPIRIDONOVA THE PARTY WHICH ALMOST ALONE FOLLOWED THE BOLSHEVIKI AND WHICH REPRESENTED THE REVOLUTIONARY PEASANTS
FROM THE FRONT AND THE VILLAGES ARRIVE EVERY DAY EVERY HOUR GREETINGS TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
JUST ACROSS THE HALL OUTSIDE WAS THE OFFICE OF THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE FOR THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
BEYOND THAT WE MADE OUT A DARK MASS OF PEOPLE AND A LINE OF SAILORS WHO YELLED FURIOUSLY AT US TO STOP
IN FRANTIC HASTE SWUNG THE PICKS AND SHOVELS AND THE EARTH--MOUNTAINS GREW
A USURPER WHOSE PLACE IS IN PETER-PAUL PRISON WITH KORNILOV AND KISHKIN
MOUNTAINS OF DIRT AND ROCK WERE PILED HIGH NEAR THE BASE OF THE WALL
ZINOVIEV ANNOUNCED THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PEASANTS CONGRESS TO A SHAKING ROAR WHICH ROSE AND BURST INTO STORM AS THE SOUND OF MUSIC BLARED DOWN THE CORRIDOR AND THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION CAME IN
A FEW MINUTES LATER COSSACK ARTILLERY OPENED FIRE ON THE BARRACKS KILLING EIGHT MEN
WE MUST ASK OURSELVES WHERE WE ARE GOING
FOR THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ABOLISHED PRIVATE PROPERTY IN LAND BUT THE REGULATIONS DRAWN UP BY THE LAND COMMITTEES ARE BASED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY
THEY SUFFER RADICAL CHANGES WITH EVERY FAR-REACHING CLASS UPHEAVAL
IT IS HEREWITH ORDERED TO ALL HOUSE COMMITTEES THAT AT 3 O'CLOCK THE TIME SET FOR POSTING THIS ORDER THEY SHALL IN PERSON AND SECRETLY NOTIFY THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE FINLAND GUARD REGIMENT CONCERNING THE AMOUNT OF WINE IN THEIR PREMISES
THEY DEMANDED STERN MEASURES IN THE ARMY AND NAVY TO DESTROY THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS COMMITTEES AND DENOUNCED THE SOVIETS

JUST AS HISTORIANS SEARCH THE RECORDS FOR THE MINUTEST DETAILS OF THE STORY OF THE PARIS COMMUNE SO THEY WILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN PETROGRAD IN NOVEMBER 1917 THE SPIRIT WHICH ANIMATED THE PEOPLE AND HOW THE LEADERS LOOKED TALKED AND ACTED
THE MINISTRIES ARE IDLE BREAD IS LACKING
SO MUCH THEY HAD TO DO SO MUCH
ON THE MORNING OF THE 5TH PRAVDA CONTAINED A FEROCIOUS PROCLAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WRITTEN BY LENIN WHICH WAS PRINTED IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COPIES POSTED ON THE WALLS EVERYWHERE AND DISTRIBUTED OVER THE FACE OF RUSSIA
WELL SAID ONE WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW THE RIGHTS OF THE MATTER
IN THE OFFICES A GREAT BABBLING CROWD HURRYING SHOUTING GESTICULATING--GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INTELLECTUALS JOURNALISTS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS FRENCH AND BRITISH OFFICERS
ALL LAND TO THE PEOPLE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEACH THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI ANYTHING HE EXCLAIMED
NOW HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT THE SOLDIER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
HE WAS EVIDENTLY TERRIFIED ALTHOUGH THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM SHOWED NO ANIMOSITY WHATEVER TOWARD HIM
THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTAKES THE SYSTEMATIC ARMING OF THE WORKERS OF ALL RUSSIA
ON NOVEMBER 25TH THE ASSEMBLY RESOLVED THAT THE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BE ASSUMED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IN WHICH ONLY MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE WHO HAD BEEN ELECTED AS DELEGATES MIGHT VOTE
EACH OF THESE CONVENTIONS ELECTED A CENTRAL COMMITTEE OR A CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TO GUARD ITS PARTICULAR INTERESTS AT THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT
HE HANDED THEM BACK AND SPAT ON THE FLOOR
ALREADY THROUGH THE IBERIAN GATE A HUMAN RIVER WAS FLOWING AND THE VAST RED SQUARE WAS SPOTTED WITH PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF THEM
SEE THESE COMRADES COME FROM THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
UP ON THE CORNER OF THE LITEINY FIVE OR SIX RED GUARDS AND A COUPLE OF SAILORS HAD SURROUNDED A NEWS-DEALER AND WERE DEMANDING THAT HE HAND OVER HIS COPIES OF THE MENSHEVIK RABOT-CHAYA GAZETA WORKERS GAZETTE ANGRILY HE SHOUTED AT THEM SHAKING HIS FIST AS ONE OF THE SAILORS TORE THE PAPERS FROM HIS STAND
THE GUARDS EXPLAINED
THEY WILL FIRE SURELY IN THE OPEN WE BEGAN TO RUN STOOPING LOW AND BUNCHING TOGETHER AND JAMMED UP SUDDENLY BEHIND THE PEDESTAL OF THE ALEXANDER COLUMN
DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE THIS RUINOUS SENSELESS CRIMINAL SLAUGHTER
EVENTS AT TSARSKOYE SELO ON THE EVENING THAT KERENSKY'S TROOPS RETREATED FROM TSARSKOYE SELO SOME PRIESTS ORGANISED A RELIGIOUS PROCESSION THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE TOWN MAKING SPEECHES TO THE CITIZENS IN WHICH THEY ASKED THE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THE RIGHTFUL AUTHORITY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS MUST BE PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF THE TRADE UNIONS AS CLASS ORGANISATIONS ACTING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE WHOLE INDUSTRIAL PLAN AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH IT
ONLY THE DOOR-SERVANTS HAD RESPONDED
IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH A DELEGATE OF THE VIKZHEL WAS SPEAKING
10 PROCLAMATIONS APPEALS FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEES OF THE MODERATE AND CONSERVATIVE FACTIONS AND THE TSAY-EE-KAH DENOUNCING ANY DEMONSTRATIONS IMPLORING THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS NOT TO LISTEN TO AGITATORS
THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-NINTH RESERVE REGIMENT OFFERS ITS UNANIMOUS SUPPORT
A SHORT STOUT WOMAN OPENED IT AND SHRANK BACK IN ALARM BABBLING I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE LAST NUMBER ADMITTED THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO FEW SUBSCRIBERS
BUT THE EDDIES OF INSURRECTION WERE SPREADING THROUGH RUSSIA WITH A SWIFTNESS SURPASSING ANY HUMAN AGENCY
WHILE WE WERE HESITATING A SOLDIER AND A SAILOR CAME DOWN THE STREET HAND IN HAND
THEN THE LONG AWAITED CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL BE POSTPONED--IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVENE IT IN TIME
DIEN CONTAINED FRAGMENTARY NEWS OF THE AGITATED NIGHT
ARE YOU KERENSKY'S TROOPS OR THE SOVIETS THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT AS THEY LOOKED UNEASILY AT EACH OTHER
HE HAS STOLEN THE MONEY AND GIVEN IT TO KERENSKY BAKLANOV DID NOT WANT TO
THE CITY LABOURER ACCORDING TO HIS OWN FASHION THE RURAL TOILER ACCORDING TO HIS WILL EACH BUILD HIS CLEAR WORLD-CONCEPTION PERMEATED WITH THE CLASS-IDEA OF THE WORKERS
JUST INSIDE A COUPLE OF SOLDIERS STOOD ON GUARD BUT THEY SAID NOTHING
A DECISIVE VICTORY IS INDISPENSABLE SO THAT THOSE WHO HESITATE WILL HAVE NO FURTHER HESITATION AT THE CITY DUMA ALL ATTENTION WAS CONCENTRATED ON THE FORMATION OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
NOW COSSACKS DECIDE
A DELEGATE OF THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN SENT TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS
TWICE A COMMISSAR WITH A COMPANY OF RED GUARDS CAME FORMALLY TO INSIST UPON THE DELIVERY OF LARGE SUMS FOR GOVERNMENT EXPENSES
IT WAS SAID THAT SOME OF THE GIRL-SOLDIERS HAD BEEN THROWN FROM THE WINDOWS INTO THE STREET MOST OF THE REST HAD BEEN VIOLATED AND MANY HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE AS A RESULT OF THE HORRORS THEY HAD GONE THROUGH
ALL WERE AGAINST THEM--BUSINESS MEN SPECULATORS INVESTORS LAND-OWNERS ARMY OFFICERS POLITICIANS TEACHERS STUDENTS PROFESSIONAL MEN SHOP-KEEPERS CLERKS AGENTS
ALL ARMY ORGANISATIONS ARE ORDERED TO TAKE EVERY MEASURE FOR THE IMMEDIATE ARREST OF KERENSKY AND HIS CONVEYANCE TO PETROGRAD
BUT WILL THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DESIRE TO DO THE WILL OF THE RUSSIAN PEASANTS
WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN THE MOONEY CASE NOW
THE HALL ROSE THUNDERING
IT WAS SILENT IN THE WOODS
STILL THE STRIKE OF THE MINISTRIES WENT ON STILL THE SABOTAGE OF THE OLD OFFICIALS THE STOPPAGE OF NORMAL ECONOMIC LIFE
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HIDDEN IN THE BRITISH EMBASSY
IN THE FACE OF A STORM OF POPULAR DISAPPROVAL THE PLAN OF EVACUATION WAS REPUDIATED
THEN CAME ABRAMOVITCH FOR THE BUND THE ORGAN OF THE JEWISH SOCIAL DEMOCRATS--HIS EYES SNAPPING BEHIND THICK GLASSES TREMBLING WITH RAGE
THEY DARE NOT FROM VOLOGDA TO CHITA IN FAR SIBERIA FROM PSKOV TO SEVASTOPOL ON THE BLACK SEA IN GREAT CITIES AND LITTLE VILLAGES CIVIL WAR BURST INTO FLAME
THE VIKZHEL ANNOUNCED THAT TRAINS MUST CEASE RUNNING BY DECEMBER FIRST
AND AS SOON AS THE LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENTS BEGIN TO ORGANISE LIFE IN THE MUNICIPALITIES THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL SOVIETS NATURALLY ENDS
FARMERS WHO THROUGH OLD AGE OR SICKNESS HAVE PERMANENTLY LOST THE CAPACITY TO WORK THE LAND THEMSELVES SHALL SURRENDER THEIR LAND AND RECEIVE INSTEAD A GOVERNMENT PENSION
STILL SILENCE
THEY THE WORKERS WERE ALL AGREED THAT OUR AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS WERE PREFERABLE TO THEIR OWN BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO EXCHANGE ONE DESPOT FOR ANOTHER I.E THE CAPITALIST CLASS
ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE LAST MINISTER OF SUPPLIES IN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT COFFEE WAS BOUGHT WHOLESALE IN VLADIVOSTOK FOR TWO RUBLES A POUND AND THE CONSUMER IN PETROGRAD PAID THIRTEEN
IT WAS IN THE WING OF ONE OF THE GRAND DUCAL PALACES FRONTING THE PARK
THE CIVIL WAR IS NOT YET FINISHED
HERE IS THE SEAL OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THEY STARED STUPIDLY AT MY PASS THEN AT EACH OTHER
CEDING TO THE FORCE OF BAYONETS THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC HAS BEEN OBLIGED TO SEPARATE AND TEMPORARILY TO INTERRUPT ITS MEETINGS
EVEN THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION BROKE DOWN
HE IS KERENSKY'S MAN
AND REALISING THE SITUATION HE LEFT THE PLATFORM AND THE ROOM TAKING HIS POPULARITY WITH HIM
ALL RANKS AND GRADES IN THE ARMY BEGINNING WITH THE RANK OF CORPORAL AND ENDING WITH THE RANK OF GENERAL ARE ABOLISHED
THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BUILDING THE LINE-MEN AND LABOURERS--THEY STAYED
AREN'T THEY WORKINGMEN LIKE OURSELVES IN THE LONG RUN EVERYTHING DEPENDED UPON THE PEASANTS

WE CALL UPON YOU TO MAINTAIN COMPLETE QUIET AND SELF-POSSESSION
THE BOURGEOIS POPULATION LIVED IN THE CELLARS
AND WE DEMAND A RE-ELECTION OF THE DUMA WHEREUPON THE BOLSHEVIKI LEFT THE CHAMBER FOLLOWED BY CRIES OF GERMAN AGENTS
ABOVE EVERYTHING WE INSIST UPON THE INFLEXIBLE EXECUTION OF THE ORGANISED WILL OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE EXPRESSED BY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT IN ACCORD WITH THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE TSAY-EE-KAH AS ORGAN OF THE POPULAR POWER
OTHER ORGANISATIONS RED GUARDS THE ARMED FACTORY WORKERS OF RUSSIA
NOT A GIRL WAS INJURED NOT ONE INSULTED
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS
THE DESPERATE MASSES CRIED OUT THAT THE BOURGEOISIE WAS SABOTAGING THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE CAUSING DEFEAT ON THE FRONT
THE PROCESSION WAS HASTILY CALLED OFF
I AM AWARE THAT THESE TWO CHAPTERS MAKE DIFFICULT READING BUT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
HOW THE UNTRAINED WORKMEN RUSHED THE CHARGING COSSACKS AND TORE THEM FROM THEIR HORSES
THOSE WHO WISH TO INTERFERE WITH THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS
KERENSKY HAS ACCEPTED--TO-DAY HE ANNOUNCED FROM HIS HIDING-PLACE THAT HE HAS RESIGNED AS PREMIER
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WAS ARMING EVERYBODY BOLSHEVISM WAS ARMING FOR THE DECISIVE BATTLE WITH KERENSKY THE SOUND OF WHOSE TRUMPETS CAME UP THE SOUTH-WEST WIND
AT THE SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY ALL PRISONERS MADE BY THE TWO PARTIES SHALL BE RELEASED
BUT SOME OF THEM JUST DON'T WANT TO FIGHT AT ALL
ON THE EVE OF INSURRECTION OUR FATAL DEFEAT WAS ALSO PREDICTED
LATER THEY WERE RELEASED ON GOOD BEHAVIOUR
I WALKED ON AIR ALL THE WAY ON THE STEPS OF SMOLNY ABOUT A HUNDRED WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES WERE MASSED WITH THEIR BANNER DARK AGAINST THE BLAZE OF LIGHT STREAMING OUT BETWEEN THE ARCHES
THE STREET-CARS RAN
MASKVIN S
THE REST WERE GOING TO STAY WE CONSIDER IT DANGEROUS AND PERHAPS EVEN MORTAL FOR THE REVOLUTION TO TRANSFER THE POWER TO THE SOVIETS"--INTERRUPTIONS--"BUT WE FEEL IT OUR DUTY TO REMAIN IN THE CONGRESS AND VOTE AGAINST THE TRANSFER HERE OTHER SPEAKERS FOLLOWED APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY ORDER
2 FROM THE COMMITTEE OF THE FINLAND GUARD RESERVE REGIMENT TO ALL HOUSE COMMITTEES AND TO THE CITIZENS OF VASILI OSTROV THE BOURGEOISIE HAS CHOSEN A VERY SINISTER METHOD OF FIGHTING AGAINST THE PROLETARIAT
WE WILL NOT LISTEN TO ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BREAK-DOWN IN THE ARMY INCIDENT UPON THE REVOLUTION THREW UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE ARMY COMMITTEES MOST OF THE WORK OF THE QUARTERMASTER'S DEPARTMENT AND IN SOME CASES EVEN THE COMMAND OF TROOPS
ZEMSTVOS MAY BE ROUGHLY TRANSLATED COUNTY COUNCILS UNDER THE TSAR SEMI-POLITICAL SEMI-SOCIAL BODIES WITH VERY LITTLE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER DEVELOPED AND CONTROLLED LARGELY BY INTELLECTUAL LIBERALS AMONG THE LAND-OWNING CLASSES
BEFORE US STANDS THE SACRED IMAGE OF TORTURED RUSSIA
LONG LIVE THE RED GUARD
MORE SOLDIERS
HOWEVER A RUSSIAN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE WHOM I WILL CALL TRUSISHKA CALMLY GOT IN AND SAT DOWN NOR COULD ANY ARGUMENT DISLODGE HIM
WE WERE IN PRISON TOGETHER KRYLENKO MADE AN EFFORT AND CONCENTRATED HIS MIND AND SIGHT
YOU ARE S ZDRA'STVUITYE THEY KISSED
BUT WHY DO YOU COMBINE WITH THE CADETS THE PSEUDO-WORKMAN SMILED FRANKLY
WE ARE FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT ALL CONSCIOUS WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS BELONGING TO OUR PARTY OR SYMPATHISING WITH IT WILL ALSO DISAPPROVE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE DESERTERS
AND FROM THAT MOMENT THERE WAS SOMETHING CONSCIOUS AND DECIDED ABOUT THE INSURRECTIONARY MASSES IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS WHICH NEVER LEFT THEM
IT SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN AND ALL PROPAGANDISTS PUNISHED
THE HONOUR OF THE WORKERS PEASANTS AND SOLDIERS REVOLUTION DEMANDS THAT NO POGROM BE TOLERATED
BUT I'LL TAKE YOU AROUND FOR A HUNDRED RUBLES BEFORE THE REVOLUTION IT COST TWO WE OBJECTED BUT HE SIMPLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
LAND CANNOT BE SOLD NOR LEASED NOR MORTGAGED NOR ALIENATED IN ANY WAY
THEY WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT OF RECEIVING FOOD
ALL MANAGERS OF PUBLICATIONS AND BUSINESSES DEALING WITH PAID ADVERTISING AS WELL AS THEIR EMPLOYEES AND WORKERS SHALL AGREE TO HOLD A CITY CONGRESS AND TO JOIN FIRST THE CITY TRADE UNIONS AND THEN THE ALL-RUSSIAN UNIONS TO ORGANISE MORE THOROUGHLY AND JUSTLY THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS IN THE SOVIET PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS TO PREPARE BETTER RULES FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITY OF ADVERTISING
BUT KERENSKY MADE A FATAL BLUNDER
WE PINCHED THE ASSISTANT MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND THE MINISTER OF RELIGIONS
FAMINE WILL CRUSH PETROGRAD
THE INTERESTS OF THE SMALL DEPOSITORS WILL BE SAFEGUARDED
MANY QUESTIONS WILL SUGGEST THEMSELVES TO THE MIND OF THE READER
KAMENIEV AND RIAZANOV SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT A MAJORITY AMONG THE PEOPLE AND THAT WITHOUT A MAJORITY INSURRECTION IS HOPELESS
THE ORANIENBAUM YUNKERS AND THE TSARSKOYE SELO VOLUNTEERS REFUSED TO COME OUT
THE PEASANTS BROUGHT TO DESPERATION COME OUT IN OPEN REBELLION
X SECT
X SECT
X SECT
X SECT
WE WARN THE RICH CLASSES AND THEIR SYMPATHISERS THAT IF THEY DO NOT CEASE THEIR SABOTAGE AND THEIR PROVOCATION IN HALTING THE TRANSPORTATION OF FOOD THEY WILL BE THE FIRST TO SUFFER
THE THIRD IS DEFINITELY TO ORGANISE THE REVOLUTIONARY POWER AND ASSURE THE REALISATION OF THE POPULAR PROGRAMME
SAVE HER
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES WHICH ARE PROVOKING CIVIL WAR AND OPENLY HOLD THEIR COURSE ON THE BONY HAND OF HUNGER WITH WHICH THEY INTEND TO OVERTHROW THE REVOLUTION AND FINISH WITH THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
WHERE WAS THE REVOLUTION
MATTERS OF EMPLOYMENT AND DISCHARGE VACATIONS WAGE SCALES REFUSAL OF WORK DEGREE OF PRODUCTIVITY AND SKILL REASONS FOR ABROGATING AGREEMENTS DISPUTES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SIMILAR PROBLEMS OF THE INTERNAL LIFE OF THE FACTORY MUST BE SETTLED EXCLUSIVELY ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEE WHICH HAS THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION ANY MEMBERS OF THE FACTORY ADMINISTRATION
AT THE DOOR OF THE PALACE THE SAME OLD SHVEITZARI IN THEIR BRASS-BUTTONED BLUE UNIFORMS WITH THE RED-AND-GOLD COLLARS POLITELY TOOK OUR COATS AND HATS AND WE WENT UP-STAIRS
FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THE PARIS COMMUNE THE COMMITTEE WILL DESTROY WITHOUT MERCY ANY LOOTER OR INSTIGATOR OF DISORDER
IT IS TRUE THEY LACKED THE POLITICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLES OF THE WEST BUT THEY WERE VERY WELL TRAINED IN VOLUNTARY ORGANISATION
COSSACKS DESERTERS BEGAN TO DRIBBLE INTO PETROGRAD DECLARING THAT KERENSKY HAD LIED TO THEM THAT HE HAD SPREAD BROADCAST OVER THE FRONT PROCLAMATIONS WHICH SAID THAT PETROGRAD WAS BURNING THAT THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD INVITED THE GERMANS TO COME IN AND THAT THEY WERE MURDERING WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND LOOTING INDISCRIMINATELY
FAR OVER TO THE LEFT LAY THE LITTLE HILL OF KRANOYE SELO THE PARADE-GROUND OF THE IMPERIAL GUARDS SUMMER CAMP AND THE IMPERIAL DAIRY
THEY COULD BE SEEN COMING THROUGH THE GATE THE BLARE OF THEIR BANNERS AND THE DULL RED--LIKE BLOOD--OF THE COFFINS THEY CARRIED
HE WAS FROM THE SOUTH BORN OF FRENCH IMMIGRANT PARENTS IN BESSARABIA
ALL THE CLAUSES OF THE SECRET TREATIES WHICH AS OCCUR IN A MAJORITY OF CASES HAVE FOR THEIR OBJECT TO PROCURE ADVANTAGES AND PRIVILEGES FOR RUSSIAN CAPITALISTS TO MAINTAIN OR AUGMENT THE ANNEXATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN IMPERIALISTS ARE DENOUNCED BY THE GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT DISCUSSION
IN THE MEANWHILE ITS COMMITTEE OF ELDERS HAD DETERMINED TO ENTER EN MASSE THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT WILL NOT BE BAD FOR THEN THEY WILL RUIN THEMSELVES AND HAVE NO POWER IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
FROM THERE HE WENT TO THE STAVKA AT MOGHILEV WHERE HE ORDERED TEN REGIMENTS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE FRONT TO MOVE AGAINST PETROGRAD
YET WHEN THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT COULD NO LONGER FIGHT FROM COLD HUNGER AND EXHAUSTION HOW INDIGNANTLY DID THIS FAMILY SCREAM COWARDS!"--HOW ASHAMED THEY WERE TO BE RUSSIANS
WE HAVE NOTHING BUT MORAL FORCE
IT WAS HALF-PAST TWO IN THE MORNING
AND THE CRONSTADT SAILORS WERE CLOSING THEM AGAIN
TAKE AWAY THE LANDS OF YOUR OWN WEALTHY LANDOWNERS
FOR THESE BOLSHEVIK MURDERERS AND ROBBERS IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF HOURS
KERENSKY'S COSSACKS WERE COMING FAST
AND NOW YOU ADVOCATE WHAT WE DID SIX MONTHS AGO
AH THESE RUSSIANS HE WENT ON THEY ARE ORIGINAL
YOU ARE NOT THE REAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE OF PETROGRAD SHRIEKS OF INSULT
THESE UNIONS WERE ALSO ORGANISED IN AN ALL-RUSSIAN BODY A SORT OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF LABOUR WHICH HAD ITS CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN THE CAPITAL
FROM PULKOVO SIX MEMBERS OF THE TSARSKOYE SELO SOVIET WENT WITH AN AUTOMOBILE-LOAD OF PROCLAMATIONS TO GATCHINA TO PROPAGANDISE THE COSSACKS
IN THE DECREE THERE MAY BE APPOINTED A DATE OTHER THAN THE DATE OF PUBLICATION ON WHICH IT SHALL BECOME LAW OR IT MAY BE PROMULGATED BY TELEGRAPH
I STOOD THERE WATCHING THE NEW DELEGATES COME IN--BURLY BEARDED SOLDIERS WORKMEN IN BLACK BLOUSES A FEW LONG-HAIRED PEASANTS
UP THE NEVSKY IN THE SOUR TWILIGHT CROWDS WERE BATTLING FOR THE LATEST PAPERS AND KNOTS OF PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO MAKE OUT THE MULTITUDES OF APPEALS SEE APP
OUR REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS ARE MOVING TO THE DON AND THE URAL IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO THIS CRIMINAL REVOLT AGAINST THE PEOPLE
THE OFFICERS HAVE ALMOST ALL GONE OVER TO KERENSKY'S FORCES OR SIMPLY GONE AWAY
THE PROPERTY OF THE PRINCIPAL CRIMINALS WILL BE CONFISCATED
WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH SLOGANS PUT BEFORE YOU ENTER THE HOUSES TAKE AWAY THE SHOES AND CLOTHES FROM THE BOURGEOISIE TUMULT
| 400
ALL THE SOLDIERS TURNED TO LOOK CURIOUSLY AS IF THEY HAD HEARD OF THEM BUT NEVER SEEN THEM
THEY_--CONSPIRATORS
IGNORANCE OF THE POPULAR MASSES
ABOUT TEN AFTER A FEW MINUTES HUDDLING THERE SOME HUNDREDS OF MEN THE ARMY SEEMED REASSURED AND WITHOUT ANY ORDERS SUDDENLY BEGAN AGAIN TO FLOW FORWARD
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
THE ORGANISATION AT WHOSE HEAD I AM IS WORKING WITHOUT REST TO UNITE ALL THE OFFICERS AND WHAT IS LEFT OF THE YUNKER SCHOOLS AND TO ARM THEM
NOBODY KNEW WHETHER THE SOLDIERS BELONGED TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THE QUESTION OF PEACE SHOULD BE RAISED WITHOUT DELAY
| +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 50 DELEGATES | PROVINCIAL ZEMSTVOS | +---------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | 59 DELEGATES | NATIONALIST ORGANISATIONS--POLES UKRAINEANS ETC
HERE THEY COME
IT FLASHED UPON ME SUDDENLY
NEXT MORNING TROTZKY MADE ANOTHER APPEAL TO THE TROOPS CHARACTERISING THE NOTE OF THE ALLIED REPRESENTATIVES AS A FLAGRANT INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA AND A BALD ATTEMPT TO FORCE BY THREATS THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TO CONTINUE THE WAR IN EXECUTION OF THE TREATIES CONCLUDED BY THE TSAR FROM SMOLNY POURED OUT PROCLAMATION AFTER PROCLAMATION SEE APP
THE OTHER FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION ITSELF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS
THE SUPPLY COMMITTEES THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL-OWNED PUBLIC UTILITIES EITHER DID NOT WORK AT ALL OR SABOTAGED
COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE DISORGANISATION OF THE FOOD SUPPLY CREATED BY THE WAR AND THE LACK OF SYSTEM IS BECOMING TO THE LAST DEGREE ACUTE THANKS TO THE SPECULATORS MARAUDERS AND THEIR FOLLOWERS ON THE RAILWAYS IN THE STEAMSHIP OFFICES FORWARDING OFFICES ETC
A FEW MINUTES LATER HE LEFT AND OLD SCHREIDER CAME OUT OF HIS OFFICE RED AND PALE BY TURNS
REFUSING TO RISE MEANS TO TRUST OUR HOPES IN THE FAITH OF THE GOOD BOURGEOISIE WHO HAVE PROMISED TO CALL THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
IN THE DARKNESS WE STUMBLED OVER LUMBER-PILES BARRICADING THE POLICE BRIDGE AND BEFORE THE STROGANOV PALACE MADE OUT SOME SOLDIERS WHEELING INTO POSITION A THREE-INCH FIELD-GUN
NOT IF THEY OFFERED A THOUSAND RUBLES
IN THE CENTRE WERE A FEW PEASANTS NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND SOME SOLDIERS
FROM MOSCOW THE NEWS IS UNCERTAIN
THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS EXTENDS TO YOU A FRATERNAL HAND
WITHOUT PREFACE HE READ IN RAPID FRENCH A COPY OF THE RESOLUTION JUST PASSED
IT REPRESENTS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE SOVIETS
IF YUNKERS AND COSSACKS SAY THEY WILL FIGHT YOU BELIEVE THEM
THE DIFFERENCE OF COURSE WENT INTO THE POCKETS OF SPECULATORS AND MERCHANTS
ON THE SIDE OF THE SOVIET TEN THOUSAND GARRISON SOLDIERS AND A FEW RED GUARDS
IN THE CONTRARY CASE THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE WILL STAND BEFORE THE HORRORS OF FAMINE BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY THEREFOR BELONGS TO THE PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE
ALL DOMINICAL LANDS LANDS ATTACHED TO TITLES LANDS BELONGING TO THE EMPEROR'S CABINET TO MONASTERIES CHURCHES POSSESSION LANDS ENTAILED LANDS PRIVATE ESTATES COMMUNAL LANDS PEASANT FREE-HOLDS AND OTHERS ARE CONFISCATED WITHOUT COMPENSATION AND BECOME NATIONAL PROPERTY AND ARE PLACED AT THE DISPOSITION OF THE WORKERS WHO CULTIVATE THEM
THE SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IN NOVEMBER LAST CONFIRMED THIS INALIENABLE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA MORE DECISIVELY AND DEFINITELY
THE BOLSHEVIK FACTION REFUSES TO REMAIN ANY LONGER IN THIS NEST OF COUNTER-REVOLUTION UPROAR
HE HAD LEFT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
AMONG THE WAGE-EARNERS AND THE LAND-WORKING PEOPLE IT WAS COMMON TO HEAR TALK OF ALL LAND TO THE PEASANTS ALL FACTORIES TO THE WORKERS IF THE PROFESSOR HAD VISITED THE FRONT HE WOULD HAVE HEARD THE WHOLE ARMY TALKING PEACE
KERENSKY WANTS AN ARMISTICE BUT HE'LL HAVE TO SURRENDER SEE APP
WE KNOW THAT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF YOU ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY AUTHORITY AGAINST THE KORNILOVTSI LED BY KERENSKY
THE OLD MAYER SCHREIDER MAJESTIC WITH HIS WHITE HAIR AND BEARD WAS DESCRIBING HIS VISIT TO SMOLNY THE NIGHT BEFORE TO PROTEST IN THE NAME OF THE MUNICIPAL SELF-GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE TSAY-EE-KAH OFFICE NOR IN THE BUREAU OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
KORNILOV WAS ORDERED BROUGHT TO PETROGRAD
IN TRADE UNION HEADQUARTERS LOZOVSKY INTRODUCED ME TO A DELEGATE OF THE RAILWAY WORKERS OF THE NICOLAI LINE WHO SAID THAT THE MEN WERE HOLDING HUGE MASS-MEETINGS CONDEMNING THE ACTION OF THEIR LEADERS
AT PRESENT WHEN EVERYBODY IS IN FAVOUR OF FORMING AN ALL-SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT MANY PEOPLE FORGET THE FIRST MINISTRY WHICH WAS NOT A COALITION GOVERNMENT AND IN WHICH THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOCIALIST--KERENSKY
A GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL THE DEMOCRACY
HE IS READY FOR BARRICADES BUT HE HAS STUDIED THEM AND ALONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD HE HAS LEARNED ABOUT THEM FROM ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
I SPEAK FOR THE PETROGRAD PROLETARIAT HE SAID HARSHLY
IT IS NOT THE REVOLUTION WHICH CAUSED DISORGANISATION IN THE ARMY--THAT DISORGANISATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED YEARS AGO BY THE OLD REGIME
AT FIRST THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES HAD DEMANDED THAT THERE BE A GOVERNMENT COMPOSED OF ALL THE SOCIALIST PARTIES IN AND OUT OF THE SOVIETS TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO A PEOPLE'S COUNCIL COMPOSED OF AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DELEGATES FROM THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS ORGANISATION AND THAT OF THE PEASANTS AND COMPLETED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CITY DUMAS AND THE ZEMSTVOS
THOSE MEMBERS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AVKSENTIEV AND THE REST WHOM WE THOUGHT WERE THE PEASANTS PROTECTORS--THEY ARE ONLY CADETS TOO
TROTZKY HAD GONE TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ORDERED THE CLERKS TO TRANSLATE THE DECREE ON PEACE INTO FOREIGN LANGUAGES
HEADS UP THEY TRAMPED IN THE CHILL MUD IRREGULAR LINES OF FOUR WITHOUT MUSIC WITHOUT DRUMS
CRIES FROM THE AUDIENCE WE THOUGHT YOU WALKED OUT LAST NIGHT
GENTLEMEN FOR TO-NIGHT YOU WILL HOLD THE PRESENT LINE STRENGTHENING THE POSITIONS BY IF YOU PLEASE INTERRUPTED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE
IN A PROVINCIAL TOWN I KNEW A MERCHANT FAMILY TURNED SPECULATOR--_MARADIOR BANDIT GHOUL THE RUSSIANS CALL IT
WE ADOPTED THE REGULATIONS FOR LAND COMMITTEES,--WHICH ARE NOT BASED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY AT ALL--BECAUSE WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THE POPULAR WILL IN THE WAY THE PEOPLE HAVE THEMSELVES DECIDED TO DO IT SO AS TO DRAW CLOSER THE COALITION OF ALL THE ELEMENTS WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION
WHEN SHE GOT THE KEYS HOWEVER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FORMER MINISTER COUNTESS PANINA HAD GONE OFF WITH ALL THE FUNDS WHICH SHE REFUSED TO SURRENDER EXCEPT ON THE ORDER OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
THE FOOLS
EITHER THEY WILL GIVE US
LONG LIVE THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE COSSACKS WITH THE SOLDIERS WORKERS AND PEASANTS OF ALL RUSSIA
COUNTER-REVOLUTION HAD BEGUN
THE CONSPIRATORS WILL BE CRUSHED
THERE WAS ROOM FOR ONLY FOUR PEOPLE
THE RED GUARDS WERE FIRST FORMED DURING THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 AND SPRANG INTO EXISTENCE AGAIN IN THE DAYS OF MARCH 1917 WHEN A FORCE WAS NEEDED TO KEEP ORDER IN THE CITY
BUT WE WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI IN ANY WAY BUT IF KALEDIN COMES TO PETROGRAD AND THE BOLSHEVIKI DEFEND THE CITY
A REVOLUTION IS A RISING OF ALL THE PEOPLE
AND THE OLD SEAMAN HAD CONSENTED
NATURALLY THERE WAS SOME TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION THAT THE GARRISON REGIMENTS WERE RELUCTANT TO EXCHANGE THEIR COMPARATIVE COMFORT FOR THE HARDSHIPS OF A WINTER CAMPAIGN
IT IS WORSE
WE ARE CONVINCED THAT IN CASE DECISIVE MEASURES BECOME NECESSARY WE SHALL BE SOLIDLY SUPPORTED BY ALL WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
IN RETURN THEY WERE PROMISED REPRESENTATION IN THE MINISTRY OF WAYS AND COMMUNICATIONS
BUT HE DOES NOT IGNORE THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER CLASSES
IN THE DARKNESS UNDERGROUND ORGANISATIONS OF ALL SORTS SUCH AS THE BLACK HUNDREDS WERE BUSY ATTEMPTING TO RESTORE REACTION IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT WE LEARNED HOW THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET WANTED TO LYNCH THEM AND SHOTS WERE FIRED--BUT THE SAILORS BROUGHT THEM SAFELY TO PETER-PAUL
THE EX-SUPREME COMMANDER GENERAL DUKHONIN FOR HAVING OPPOSED RESISTANCE TO THE EXECUTION OF ORDERS FOR CRIMINAL ACTION SUSCEPTIBLE OF PROVOKING A NEW CIVIL WAR IS DECLARED ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
| +------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------+ | BLACKSMITH | 1
IT IS JUST BEGINNING ON THE LANDING I MET RIAZANOV VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE TRADE UNIONS LOOKING BLACK AND BITING HIS GREY BEARD
I ASK THE AMERICAN COMRADES TO CARRY WORD TO AMERICA THAT THE RUSSIANS WILL NEVER GIVE UP THEIR REVOLUTION UNTIL THEY DIE
AND ON NOVEMBER 16TH LENIN AND MILIUTIN PUBLISHED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO PROVINCIAL EMISSARIES OF WHOM THOUSANDS WERE SENT BY THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT INTO THE VILLAGES
ON THE FRONT THE ARMY COMMITTEES WERE ALWAYS RUNNING FOUL OF OFFICERS WHO COULD NOT GET USED TO TREATING THEIR MEN LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
HERE IN THIS HOLY PLACE SAID THE STUDENT HOLIEST OF ALL RUSSIA WE SHALL BURY OUR MOST HOLY
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS A STRIKE HAS BEEN DECLARED BY THE TEACHERS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
AFTER THE REVOLUTION HE WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PERSONS EXILED FOR HIS POLITICAL AND PERSONAL RECORD
ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 22ND HE WAS COMMUNICATED WITH BY TELEPHONE AND ASKED IF HE INTENDED TO OBEY THE ORDER
COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV COMMANDANT OF THE CITY HURRIED BETWEEN THE STAFF AND THE WINTER PALACE EVIDENTLY WITHOUT ANY PLAN
THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY TALK OF DESTROYING THE BOLSHEVIKI"--AND VERY LITTLE ABOUT EXCLUDING THEM FROM THE GOVERNMENT EXCEPT FROM THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS AND THE PEASANTS SOVIETS
MOREOVER OTHER BOLSHEVIK LEADERS HAVE TAKEN THE FLOOR IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS AND ALSO MADE AN APPEAL TO IMMEDIATE INSURRECTION
ON ITS SIDE THE GOVERNMENT WAS PREPARING
WE CAN'T MOBILISE A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS
A SLANT-EYED MONGOLIAN-FACED MAN WHO SAT BESIDE ME DRESSED IN A GOAT-SKIN CAUCASIAN CAPE SNAPPED LOOK OUT
PETROGRAD CRONSTADT AND FINLAND WERE DECLARED IN A STATE OF SIEGE--UPON WHICH THE BOURGEOIS NOVOYE VREMYA NEW TIMES REMARKED IRONICALLY
NOVEMBER 6TH WILL BE TOO EARLY
THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS TALK IN HIS OWN WORDS I GIVE HERE
WE ARE RED GUARDS
TO A DELEGATION OF YUNKERS KERENSKY SAID AS CHIEF OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND AS SUPREME COMMANDER I KNOW NOTHING I CANNOT ADVISE YOU
AS WE STROLLED FROM ROOM TO ROOM A SMALL GROUP FOLLOWED US UNTIL BY THE TIME WE REACHED THE GREAT PICTURE-GALLERY WHERE WE HAD SPENT THE AFTERNOON WITH THE YUNKERS ABOUT A HUNDRED MEN SURGED IN AFTER US
KERENSKY HAS FLED ABANDONING YOU TO THE GERMANS TO FAMINE TO BLOODY MASSACRES
THEY DID NOT MOVE
HE DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN THE PRESS DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND THE PRESS AFTER THE VICTORY
SO LONG AS THIS IDEA HAS NOT BEEN REALISED FOR ALL THE NATURAL TRANSITION THROUGH ALL THE SCHOOLING GRADES UP TO THE UNIVERSITY--A TRANSITION TO A HIGHER STAGE--MUST DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE PUPIL'S APTITUDE AND NOT UPON THE RESOURCES OF HIS FAMILY
LET'S GO TO THAT HOUSE
GENERAL TCHERMISSOV HAS RECOGNISED THE COMMITTEE-COMMISSAR OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT VOITINSKY HAS RESIGNED SO
THE GREAT RED BUILDING OF THE GENERAL STAFF WAS UNUSUALLY ANIMATED SEVERAL ARMOURED AUTOMOBILES RANKED BEFORE THE DOOR AND MOTORS FULL OF OFFICERS WERE COMING AND GOING
ROBBERIES AND HOUSEBREAKINGS INCREASED
THE WAR HAS DRAINED ALL THE RESOURCES FROM COSSACK FARM LIFE
THE GARRISONS OF ALL THE LITTLE TOWNS SOUTHWARD HAD SPLIT HOPELESSLY BITTERLY INTO TWO FACTIONS--OR THREE
IN CONSEQUENCE THE COSSACKS WILL LEND ALL THEIR SUPPORT TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A GOVERNMENT OF COALITION
THE LANDLADY HEARD US COME IN AND STUMBLED OUT IN A PINK SILK WRAPPER
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE RETURN TO THE ARMY OF GENERALS AND OTHER OFFICERS UNJUSTLY DISCHARGED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF COMMITTEES AND OTHER IRRESPONSIBLE ORGANISATIONS APPENDIX TO CHAPTER II 1
LOOTERS I PRODUCED OUR PASSES FROM THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
KERENSKY HAS FLED
THE GOVERNMENT CAN EVACUATE PETROGRAD THEN A STATE OF SIEGE DECLARED AND THE MILITARY COMMANDER OF THE DISTRICT CAN DEAL WITH THESE GENTLEMEN WITHOUT LEGAL FORMALITIES
MEN WENT IN FRESH AND VIGOROUS
EIGHTEEN SHELLS WERE FIRED AND THE REBELS WERE WARNED THAT THE BOMBARDMENT WOULD BECOME MORE INTENSE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MEAN
THE RAILWAY MEN SAID THEY DID NOT RECOGNISE THE BOLSHEVIKI AND HAD TAKEN THE ENTIRE RAILROAD APPARATUS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS REFUSING TO ENTRUST IT TO ANY USURPATORY POWER
LITTLE EYES A SNUBBISH NOSE WIDE GENEROUS MOUTH AND HEAVY CHIN
WINTER WAS ALWAYS RUSSIA'S BEST FRIEND
A FEW BLOCKS DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER WE WOKE UP A GROTESQUELY-PADDED IZVOSTCHIK ASLEEP UPRIGHT ON THE BOX OF HIS LITTLE SLEIGH
5 EVEN NOVAYA ZHIZN CHARACTERISED IT AS A COMBINATION OF DEMAGOGUERY AND IMPOTENCE FROM DAY TO DAY IT SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS SINKS DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE MIRE OF SUPERFICIAL HASTE
IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF CORRUPTION OF MONSTROUS HALF-TRUTHS ONE CLEAR NOTE SOUNDED DAY AFTER DAY THE DEEPENING CHORUS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS
THIS COMRADE WE KNOW TO BE A TRUE COMRADE HE SAID
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT TO WHICH YOU SWORE FIDELITY IN THE GREAT DAYS OF MARCH IS NOT OVERTHROWN BUT BY VIOLENCE EXPELLED FROM THE EDIFICE IN WHICH IT HELD ITS MEETINGS
SPEAKER SUCCEEDED SPEAKER DEBATING AMID TENSE SILENCE ROARS OF APPROVAL OR ANGER
THE QUANTITY OF DEMOCRACY WE GET IN THE PEACE SETTLEMENT DEPENDS ON THE QUANTITY OF REVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE THERE IS IN EUROPE
ON ONE SIDE A HANDFUL OF WORKMEN AND COMMON SOLDIERS WITH ARMS IN THEIR HANDS REPRESENTING A VICTORIOUS INSURRECTION--AND PERFECTLY MISERABLE
AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE SIGNS EVERYWHERE THAT THE FORCES OF REACTION WERE GAINING CONFIDENCE.(SEE APP
WHEN THE ALLIES PERMIT
THE COSSACKS WERE COMPLETELY DEMORALISED
THE ALLIES REFUSED TO TALK WITH SKOBELIEV
WE CAME TO SUPPORT THE SOVIETS AGAINST THE DAMN BOURGEOISIE AH WERE FURIOUS CRIES
OF ALL THE NECESSARY ALTERATIONS IN ITS COMPOSITION AND CONSTRUCTION THE STATE COMMISSION WILL HAVE CHARGE ELECTED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS AND THE STATE COMMITTEE
THE WORDS OF THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT WHO ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SPEAK OF POPULACE WHEN IT IS QUESTION OF THE MOVEMENT OF IMPORTANT SECTIONS OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE ARMY--ALTHOUGH LED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION--ARE NOTHING BUT AN INCITEMENT TO CIVIL WAR THE ORDER OF THE DAY PROPOSED BY THE LEFT WAS VOTED
DO NOT DIG THEIR PROVOCATORY APPEALS
NO GESTURES
PETROGRAD IS IN DANGER
WE WON'T SHOOT UNARMED RUSSIAN PEOPLE WE WILL GO FORWARD
THEY HAVEN'T THE MEN TO RUN A GOVERNMENT
THAT HE BELIEVED IN THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION BOARD AND THE NECESSITY FOR A LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS AND PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OVER SECRET DIPLOMACY WHICH DID NOT MEAN THE ABOLITION OF SECRET DIPLOMACY
SOMETHING WAS KINDLED IN THESE MEN
EXCEPT FOR FAR-AWAY SOLDIERS WHO SEEMED TO BE CARRYING WOOD OUT OF THE PALACE COURTYARD AND PILING IT IN FRONT OF THE MAIN GATEWAY EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
WORKERS CONTROL OVER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
GOTZ SAT THERE DAN LIEBER BOGDANOV BROIDO FILLIPOVSKY,--WHITE-FACED HOLLOW-EYED AND INDIGNANT
MAKE ACTIVE RESISTANCE TO THE KORNILOVITZ-KERENSKY
HUNDREDS OF DELEGATES FROM THE FRONT HE SAID ARE BEING ELECTED WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SOLDIERS BECAUSE THE ARMY COMMITTEES ARE NO LONGER THE REAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RANK AND FILE LUKIANOV CRYING THAT OFFICERS LIKE KHARASH AND KHINTCHUK COULD NOT REPRESENT THE ARMY IN THIS CONGRESS,--BUT ONLY THE HIGH COMMAND
EXPEDITIONS OF SAILORS HEAVILY ARMED WERE SENT OUT IN GROUPS OF FIVE THOUSAND TO THE SOUTH TO SIBERIA WITH ROVING COMMISSIONS TO CAPTURE CITIES STILL HELD BY THE WHITE GUARDS ESTABLISH ORDER AND GET FOOD PASSENGER TRAFFIC ON THE TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD WAS SUSPENDED FOR TWO WEEKS WHILE THIRTEEN TRAINS LOADED WITH BOLTS OF CLOTH AND BARS OF IRON ASSEMBLED BY THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES WERE SENT OUT EASTWARD EACH IN CHARGE OF A COMMISSAR TO BARTER WITH THE SIBERIAN PEASANTS FOR GRAIN AND POTATOES
THE DIMENSIONS OF THESE PLOTS AND THE RATE OF TAXES FOR THEIR USE SHALL BE FIXED BY LAW
APPENDIX TO CHAPTER V 1
I MYSELF AM A SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY OF THE RIGHT WING
THE BOURGEOISIE WILL BREAK THE CONSTITUENT BY SABOTAGE BY LOCK-OUTS BY GIVING UP PETROGRAD BY OPENING THE FRONT TO THE GERMANS
IN DIM BACK STREETS AUTOMOBILES WITHOUT LIGHTS FLITTED TO AND FRO AND THERE WAS FURTIVE ACTIVITY IN FONTANKA 6 HEADQUARTERS OF THE PEASANTS SOVIET IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT OF A HUGE BUILDING ON THE NEVSKY AND IN THE INJINIERNY ZAMOK SCHOOL OF ENGINEERS
ITS AUTHORITY GOES NO FARTHER

HE WAS PLAINLY UNDECIDED
THEY ARE TRYING TO STARVE US AND FREEZE US
IN THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING A COMPANY OF YUNKERS DISGUISED AS SOLDIERS OF THE SEMIONOVSKY REGIMENT PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE JUST BEFORE THE HOUR OF CHANGING GUARD
A STROKE OF HIGH TREASON IS BEING CONTEMPLATED AGAINST THE PETROGRAD SOVIET
THE CYCLE CORPS SENT FROM THE FRONT HAS ARRIVED AT TSARSKOYE AND THE SOLDIERS ARE NOW WITH US
AFTER THE MARCH REVOLUTION IT WAS JOINED BY MANY WHO HAD NEVER BEEN SOCIALISTS
AND TO YOU COSSACK PRIVATES
2 ALL LAND-OWNERS ESTATES AND ALL LANDS BELONGING TO THE CROWN TO MONASTERIES CHURCH LANDS WITH ALL THEIR LIVE STOCK AND INVENTORIED PROPERTY BUILDINGS AND ALL APPURTENANCES ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE DISPOSITION OF THE TOWNSHIP LAND COMMITTEES AND THE DISTRICT SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES UNTIL THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MEETS
LET US OPEN THE CHEST SAID BAKLANOV
THE OTHER OLD PEASANT SPOKE TO HIS COMRADE I AM NOT TIRED HE SAID
EMISSARIES CAME AND WENT REPORTING HORRIBLE DEEDS BY THE BOLSHEVIKI INTERCEDING TO SAVE THE YUNKERS BUSILY INVESTIGATING
I WAS ALREADY SUSPICIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON
ENCHANTED
UPON WHAT FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS WILL REST THIS STATE COMMISSION
A ROW OF HOUSES FACING THE CROSS-ROADS WAS MARKED WITH BULLETS AND THE EARTH WAS TRAMPLED INTO MUD HALF A MILE AROUND
ADVERTISEMENTS MAY ONLY BE PUBLISHED IN THE ORGANS OF THE PROVISIONAL WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT AT PETROGRAD AND IN THE ORGANS OF LOCAL SOVIETS
ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES SHALL FORM A WORKERS MILITIA
ALL THE DIPLOMATS PRESENT EXCEPT THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR WHO EVERYBODY SAID WAS PROSTRATED BY THE CARSO DISASTER
GUNS AND CARTRIDGE-BELTS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT
THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE TSAY-EE-KAH THE TSAY-EE-KAH SHALL BE ENLARGED TO 150 MEMBERS
THE REAL INHABITANTS OF THE TRENCHES WANT WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THE TRANSFER OF POWER INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS AND THEY EXPECT VERY MUCH FROM IT
CHAPTER II THE COMING STORM IN SEPTEMBER GENERAL KORNILOV MARCHED ON PETROGRAD TO MAKE HIMSELF MILITARY DICTATOR OF RUSSIA
THE PROMULGATION OF LEGISLATIVE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE SENATE IS ABOLISHED
HELSINGFORS SOVIET PASSED RESOLUTIONS OF SUPPORT
ACCORDING TO THE NEW SOVIET LAWS THE LANDS OF COSSACK LANDOWNERS MUST PASS WITHOUT COMPENSATION INTO THE HANDS OF THE COSSACK WORKERS THE POORER COSSACKS
THE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WALKING OUT INTO THE ROAD
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED TWO REPRESENTATIVES--GENERAL ALEXEYEV REACTIONARY MILITARY MAN AND TERESTCHENKO MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL DOUBTLESS SOON BEGIN ITS WORK
VERY CONVENIENT HE SAID
IT WILL ESTABLISH WORKMEN'S CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND WILL SET UP A GENERAL CONTROL OVER THE BANKS WHICH IT WILL TRANSFORM INTO A STATE MONOPOLY
BEFORE US ARE STRUGGLES OBSTACLES AND SACRIFICES
FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THE PROBLEMS OF THE REVOLUTION SHOULD BE SOLVED IN THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE MANNER--BUT THE BOLSHEVIKI WERE NOT INTERESTED IN HOW THESE PROBLEMS WERE TO BE SOLVED
RED GUARDS WERE AT THE DOOR
THE TSAY-EE-KAH THE ALL-RUSSIAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF PEASANT DEPUTIES THE ARMY ORGANISATIONS THE TSENTROFLOT THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES THE COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS AND OTHERS
THE CENTRAL CITY DUMA OF PETROGRAD APPEALS TO ALL DUMAS AND ZEMSTVOS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC TO RALLY TO THE DEFENCE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST CONQUESTS OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION--THE INDEPENDENCE AND INVIOLABILITY OF POPULAR SELF-GOVERNMENT 3
NO ONE MUST BE ON THE STREETS AFTER EIGHT IN THE EVENING EXCEPT THE REGULAR GUARDS
ON BEHALF OF THE MENSHEVIKI KHINTCHUK THEN ANNOUNCED THAT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY OF A PEACEFUL SOLUTION WAS TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FORMATION OF A NEW CABINET WHICH WOULD FIND SUPPORT IN ALL STRATA OF SOCIETY
AT ANY RATE THEY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE CONSTITUENT--THAT IS IF THERE IS A CONSTITUENT AND THEN TOO SAID THE OFFICER THAT BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF ADMITTING THE CADETS INTO THE NEW GOVERNMENT--AND FOR THE SAME REASONS
ALL LAND UPON ITS CONFISCATION IS POOLED IN THE GENERAL PEOPLE'S LAND FUND
ON SOCIAL INSURANCE THE RUSSIAN PROLETARIAT HAS INSCRIBED ON ITS BANNERS THE PROMISE OF COMPLETE SOCIAL INSURANCE OF WAGE-WORKERS AS WELL AS OF THE TOWN AND VILLAGE POOR
AT 10 P
THE RED GUARDS BLOOD WAS UP
P ROSSISKAYA PARTIA_)[13 AT THE MIKHAILOVSKY A MAN APPEARED WITH AN ARMFUL OF NEWSPAPERS AND WAS IMMEDIATELY STORMED BY FRANTIC PEOPLE OFFERING A ROUBLE FIVE ROUBLES TEN ROUBLES TEARING AT EACH OTHER LIKE ANIMALS
THE CONFERENCE OF THE UNION OF RAILWAY WORKERS WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH THE BELLIGERENT PARTIES WHO ADMIT THE NECESSITY OF AN AGREEMENT PROTEST ENERGETICALLY AGAINST THE USE OF POLITICAL TERRORISM IN THE CIVIL WAR ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS CARRIED ON BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY AND DECLARE THAT POLITICAL TERRORISM IN WHATEVER FORM IS IN CONTRADICTION TO THE VERY IDEA OF THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT
DIDN'T I SAY SO TWO SOLDIERS NOW ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION
THE ARMY AND THE RED GUARD OF THE REVOLUTION ARE IN NEED OF THE IMMEDIATE SUPPORT OF THE WORKERS
213 PETROGRAD SMOLNY INSTITUTE ROOM NO
THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO DO IT
AT THE MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET ZINOVIEV SAID IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD FINISH AFFAIR
TO THE ARMY APPEAL TO SET UP MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES
BUT THEY ARE STRANGE FOLK THESE AMBASSADORS
THE CROWD IS EXTREMELY NOISY CHEERING OR HECKLING SPEAKERS OVER-RIDING THE PLANS OF THE PRESIDIUM AMONG THE CUSTOMARY CRIES ARE
IT WAS PRECISELY LIKE THE DEBATE OF SOLDIERS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
TROTZKY'S SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC THE PURPOSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE WHICH WAS CALLED BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH WAS TO DO AWAY WITH THE IRRESPONSIBLE PERSONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH PRODUCED KORNILOV AND TO ESTABLISH A RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT WHICH WOULD BE CAPABLE OF FINISHING THE WAR AND ENSURE THE CALLING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AT THE GIVEN TIME
AND I ANSWER THAT IN ANY CASE IF EUROPE CONTINUES TO BE RULED BY THE IMPERIALIST BOURGEOISIE REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA WILL INEVITABLY BE LOST
KORNILOV WAS ARRESTED BY THE SOLDIERS COMMITTEES
ARE THE AMERICAN WORKERS READY TO THROW OVER THE CAPITALISTS
THE SOLDIERS CONSULTED IN LOW TONES FOR A MOMENT AND THEN LED ME TO A WALL AGAINST WHICH THEY PLACED ME
A GOVERNMENT WHICH IN ITS TIME WAS VERY POPULAR
ARRESTS COUNTER-ARRESTS SKIRMISHES BETWEEN CLASHING PATROLS OF SOLDIERS YUNKERS AND RED GUARDS
FOREIGNERS AND AMERICANS ESPECIALLY FREQUENTLY EMPHASISE THE IGNORANCE OF THE RUSSIAN WORKERS
BUT A FEW BLOCKS AWAY WE COULD SEE THE TRAMS THE CROWDS THE LIGHTED SHOP-WINDOWS AND THE ELECTRIC SIGNS OF THE MOVING-PICTURE SHOWS--LIFE GOING ON AS USUAL
AND CAME OUT LIMP BLIND WITH FATIGUE HOARSE AND FILTHY TO FALL ON THE FLOOR AND SLEEP
ONE HAD A BOTTLE OF WHITE BURGUNDY EVIDENTLY FILCHED FROM THE CELLARS OF THE PALACE
YOU WILL SEE IN A FEW DAYS
THE CAUSE OF ORDER AND REVOLUTION IS IN STRONG HANDS
WHAT I MUST SAY IS THAT THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY SUCCESSFUL IN THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS REVOLUTION BY THE HELP OF YOU AND OF ALL THE REST OF THE BRAVE COMRADES WHO HAVE OF YOU AND OF ALL THE REST OF THE BRAVE COMRADES WHO HAVE HURLED DOWN FOREVER THE POWER OF THE BLOOD-THIRSTY BOURGEOISIE PROMISED TO OFFER PEACE TO ALL THE PEOPLES AND THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE--TO-DAY TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
BUT I BEG YOU COMRADES TO GIVE ME YOUR SUPPORT
ONE LITTLE WORKMAN KEPT EXPLAINING DOGGEDLY TO THE PEOPLE AND THE NEWS-DEALER OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT HAS KERENSKY'S PROCLAMATION IN IT
THE THREE SONS HAD BRIBED THEIR WAY OUT OF MILITARY SERVICE
THE OLD WORKMAN WHO DROVE HELD THE WHEEL IN ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE SWEPT THE FAR-GLEAMING CAPITAL IN AN EXULTANT GESTURE
VLADIMIR NICOLAIEVITCH STEPPED FORWARD
FROM THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS THE EX-MINISTERS KONOVALOV KISHKIN TERESTCHENKO MALIANTOVITCH NIKITIN AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THIS I MAY REMARK PARENTHETICALLY IS THE LAST TIME HISTORY MENTIONS THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
HERE WAS THE REVOLUTION
INSURANCE FOR ALL WAGE-WORKERS WITHOUT EXCEPTION AS WELL AS FOR ALL URBAN AND RURAL POOR
ALL RUSSIA HE WAVED HIS HAND DISTRACTEDLY AND RAN OFF
BUT LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TOO FAR--THAT IF THEY DARE TO LAY THEIR HANDS UPON THE ORGANISATIONS OF THE PROLETARIAT WE WILL SWEEP THEM AWAY LIKE SCUM FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH THE BOLSHEVIK PRESS SUDDENLY EXPANDED
DEATH BATTALIONS OR SHOCK BATTALIONS THE WOMEN'S BATTALION IS KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS THE DEATH BATTALION BUT THERE WERE MANY DEATH BATTALIONS COMPOSED OF MEN
TO-DAY LENIN AND TROTZKY
BY SEPTEMBER THE METROPOLITAN WORKMEN THE SAILORS OF THE BALTIC FLEET AND THE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN WON ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THEIR CAUSE
WE LEAVE THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AT THE MOMENT OF VICTORY
THE REACTIONARIES WERE USING THE STATE BANK AS A POLITICAL WEAPON
THE SECOND STAGE WAS THE STRENGTHENING OF THE SOVIETS AND THE POLITICAL COMPROMISE WITH THE BOURGEOISIE
THE FREELY-ELECTED CITY GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE DISSOLVED BY ANY POWER
I HAVE BEEN AWAY
WITH THESE FACTS WAS MIXED AN ASTOUNDING JUMBLE OF RUMOURS DISTORTIONS AND PLAIN LIES
FOR US ARE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS AND THE OPPRESSED OF THE WHOLE WORLD
ABOUT FIVE MILES OUT WE SAW A SQUAD OF SAILORS MARCHING BACK AND SLOWED DOWN
IN THE MEANWHILE UNREBUKED WE WALKED INTO THE PALACE
HE SEEMED SURPRISED
SUCH A SITUATION CANNOT BE BORNE A SINGLE DAY LONGER
DAY BROKE AND THE PICKETS OF KERENSKY'S COSSACKS CAME IN TOUCH
STAFF
AT THE SAME TIME THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OTHER PARTIES MENSHEVIKI SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES EITHER GAVE NO ANSWER AT ALL OR DECLARED SIMPLY THAT THEY WERE OPPOSED TO THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS AND AGAINST THE DECREES ON LAND PEACE AND WORKERS CONTROL
WHAT WILL YOU DO ANOTHER SAILOR CAME UP VERY MUCH IRRITATED
THE DELEGATES WERE ROUGHLY TOLD WE ONLY RECOGNISE THE TSAY-EE-KAH WE DO NOT RECOGNISE YOU
ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS
IF THE GERMAN PROLETARIAT REALISES THAT WE ARE READY TO CONSIDER ALL OFFERS OF PEACE THAT WILL PERHAPS BE THE LAST DROP WHICH OVERFLOWS THE BOWL--REVOLUTION WILL BREAK OUT IN GERMANY
I SAY POPULACE INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE THE CONSCIOUS DEMOCRACY AND ITS TSAY-EE-KAH ALL THE ARMY ORGANISATIONS ALL THAT FREE RUSSIA GLORIFIES THE GOOD SENSE THE HONOUR AND THE CONSCIENCE OF THE GREAT RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY PROTESTS AGAINST THESE THINGS
THE OFFICERS IN COMMAND WERE ELECTED BY THEM FOR THE MOMENT THAT INCOHERENT MULTIPLE WILL WAS ONE WILL
CANNIBAL THE VICTORY OVER OUR ADVERSARIES IS NOT YET ACHIEVED AND THE NEWSPAPERS ARE ARMS IN THEIR HANDS
WHEN WE SHOWED HIM OUR PAPERS FROM SMOLNY HE LOST HIS TEMPER AND DECLARED THAT HE WAS NO BOLSHEVIK THAT HE REPRESENTED THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY
THE UNION SUPPORTS THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH AND DECLARES THAT THE CONGRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO ELECT A NEW COMMITTEE
AS FOR THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS WE AFFIRM THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
IN THE END WHEN BOLSHEVISM HAD CONQUERED IN BOTH THESE COUNTRIES THE DEFEATED BOURGEOISIE CALLED IN THE GERMANS TO RESTORE THEM TO POWER
THE TSAY-EE-KAH HAD DELIBERATED ON THE DECLARATION MADE BY THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS AND HAD ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION AT THE CONFERENCE EVEN INCLUDING DELEGATES FROM THE ARMY COMMITTEES AND THE PEASANTS SOVIETS
THE ORDER OF BUSINESS CAN BE AND USUALLY IS SMASHED TO PIECES IN THE FIRST HALF HOUR
WELL HE CRIED WE'RE OFF
DOWNSTAIRS IN THE OFFICE OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES SAT SERATOV SIGNING ORDERS ON THE GOVERNMENT ARSENAL FOR ARMS--ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RIFLES FOR EACH FACTORY
THE EMBASSIES RECOGNISE THE DUMA AS THE ONLY POWER NOW HE EXPLAINED
PROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TO ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
IT WAS BITTERLY COLD AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO LIGHT THE FIRES
ON EARTH THEY WERE BUILDING A KINGDOM MORE BRIGHT THAN ANY HEAVEN HAD TO OFFER AND FOR WHICH IT WAS A GLORY TO DIE
THE FIRST QUESTION MUST BE A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE CRISIS
I WISH YOU WELCOME COMRADES PEASANTS
THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP ARE ALWAYS CALLING UPON US TO SACRIFICE MORE SACRIFICE MORE WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE EVERYTHING ARE LEFT UNMOLESTED
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO WAIT UNTIL THE BOURGEOISIE CHOKES THE REVOLUTION
THE BAND WAS PLAYING THE REVOLUTIONARY FUNERAL MARCH AND AGAINST THE IMMENSE SINGING OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE STANDING UNCOVERED THE PARADERS SANG HOARSELY CHOKED WITH SOBS
WE THE FRONT GROUP DISCLAIM ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND IS HAPPENING AND WE CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO MOBILISE ALL SELF-CONSCIOUS REVOLUTIONARY FORCES FOR THE SALVATION OF THE REVOLUTION
OUR COMMON FOES THE LANDOWNERS CAPITALISTS OFFICERS-KORNILOVISTS BOURGEOIS NEWSPAPERS ARE DECEIVING YOU AND DRIVING YOU ALONG THE ROAD TO RUIN
BUT THEY HAVE NOT COUNTED ON THE PEASANTS
THE CITY DUMA APPOINTED A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER
PROFESSING TO BE SOCIALISTS THE POPULISTS REALLY SUPPORTED THE INTERESTS OF THE PETTY BOURGEOISIE--CLERKS SHOPKEEPERS ETC
ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE MANIACS IS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL THEY LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND RECOGNISE THE AUTHORITY OF INDEPENDENT COURTS OF LAW YARTSEV FOR THE YEDINSTVO GROUP DECLARED THAT ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO A BOLSHEVIK VICTORY
FIGHTING HAS BEGUN
10 GREECE AND PERSIA TO BE RESTORED
THE APPEALS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI TO INSURRECTION AND ANARCHY ARE ACTS PUNISHABLE BY THE CRIMINAL COURTS AND IN THE FREEST COUNTRIES THEIR AUTHORS WOULD RECEIVE SEVERE SENTENCES
THE STREET-CARS WERE RUNNING ON THE NEVSKY MEN WOMEN AND SMALL BOYS HANGING ON EVERY PROJECTION
THE RED GUARDS WERE HERE TWO HOURS AGO BUT THEY WENT AWAY AGAIN
THE LAST TWO DAYS WERE DAYS OF ENFORCED WORK FOR OUR STAFF TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY QUANTITY OF GUNS MACHINE-GUNS FIELD TELEPHONES ETC FOR THE REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS
THE WORK OF GUIDING IN GENERAL THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION INASMUCH AS IT REMAINS WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS UNTIL THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY MEETS ENTRUSTED TO A COMMISSION ON THE PEOPLE'S EDUCATION WHOSE CHAIRMAN AND EXECUTIVE IS THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR
KERENSKY'S PUBLIC DENIAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD ANY SUCH INTENTION WAS MET WITH HOOTS OF DERISION
TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD CHAPTER I BACKGROUND TOWARD THE END OF SEPTEMBER 1917 AN ALIEN PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY VISITING RUSSIA CAME TO SEE ME IN PETROGRAD
EVEN IF KERENSKY WOULDN'T COME THEY HAVEN'T THE MEN TO RUN A GOVERNMENT
IN PETROGRAD ALL IS QUIET
SOURCES MUCH OF THE MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK IS FROM MY OWN NOTES
THEY ARE BOMBARDING THE KREMLIN THE NEWS PASSED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH IN THE STREETS OF PETROGRAD ALMOST WITH A SENSE OF TERROR
WE HAVE YUNKERS IN THE FRONT OF THE PALACE
THE SEPTEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE LARGE CITIES SEE APP
THIS WAY COMRADES CRIED ONE
HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD WITH AN ENORMOUS HAND FROWNING
THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO WASH FROM THEIR BODIES THE STAIN OF THE PEOPLE'S HATRED AND CONTEMPT
THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM IS CONTROLLED BY THE MUNICIPAL DUMA
THAT THINGS SHOULD SETTLE DOWN
AFTER THIS REVISION THESE LAWS WILL BE PUT INTO EFFECT WITHOUT ANY BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE IN THE REVOLUTIONARY ORDER
THE DECREE OF MORATORIUM FOR HOUSE-RENTS
WE BLAME DECISIVELY SUCH DESERTION
BUT LIKE THE CITY DUMAS THEY COULD NOT COMPETE WITH THE SOVIETS 6
SHLIAPNIKOV COMMISSAR OF LABOUR HAD COMMANDED ALL THE EMPLOYEES OF HIS MINISTRY TO RETURN TO THEIR PLACES WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OR LOSE THEIR PLACES AND THEIR PENSION-RIGHTS
AND NOW TROTZKY STOOD UPON THE RAISED TRIBUNE CONFIDENT AND DOMINATING WITH THAT SARCASTIC EXPRESSION ABOUT HIS MOUTH WHICH WAS ALMOST A SNEER
IN THE ROOF WAS A JAGGED HOLE MADE BY KERENSKY'S CANNON
A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONIST
SMOLNY WAS ALMOST EMPTY BUT THE DUMA WAS THRONGED AND NOISY
FOR INSTANCE THIS FROM THE MILITARY SECTION OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
TO BE COMMUNICATED TO ALL COMMANDERS OF STAFFS COMMANDERS IN CHIEF COMMANDERS EVERYWHERE AND TO ALL ALL ALL THE EX-MINISTER KERENSKY HAS SENT A DELIBERATELY FALSE TELEGRAM TO EVERY ONE EVERYWHERE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE TROOPS OF REVOLUTIONARY PETROGRAD HAVE VOLUNTARILY SURRENDERED THEIR ARMS AND JOINED THE ARMIES OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNMENT OF TREASON AND THAT THE SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TO RETREAT
IN FRONT OF THE STATE BANK SOME SOLDIERS WITH FIXED BAYONETS WERE STANDING AT THE CLOSED GATES
UNDER THIS STOOD A BIG ARMORED AUTOMOBILE WITH RACING ENGINE AND OIL-SMOKE POURING OUT OF IT
TRANSPORTATION IS DEMORALISED THE FACTORIES ARE CLOSING DOWN AND THE GERMANS ARE ADVANCING
THEN THE OLD MAYOR STEPPED INTO THE TRIBUNE
13 RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOR PARTY ON THE CORNER OF THE SADOVAYA ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CITIZENS HAD GATHERED STARING UP AT THE ROOF OF A TALL BUILDING WHERE A TINY RED SPARK GLOWED AND WANED
IT WAS TCHUDNOVSKY REPORTED KILLED IN THE JULY FIGHTING AND NOW RISEN FROM THE DEAD
THERE AN ENORMOUS SMILING SAILOR STOPPED ME AND WHEN I SHOWED MY PASS JUST SAID IF YOU WERE SAINT MICHAEL HIMSELF COMRADE YOU COULDN'T PASS HERE THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE DOOR I MADE OUT THE DISTORTED FACE AND GESTICULATING ARMS OF A FRENCH CORRESPONDENT LOCKED IN
WHEN FINALLY THE BOLSHEVIKI FOUND AND REQUISITIONED VAST HOARDED STORES OF PROVISIONS WHAT ROBBERS THEY WERE
DOWN FRONT WERE SOME SOLDIERS AND SAILORS STARING AT THE SCREEN IN CHILDLIKE WONDER TOTALLY UNABLE TO COMPREHEND WHY THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH VIOLENT RUNNING ABOUT AND SO MUCH HOMICIDE
ULIANOV LENIN ACCEPTED FOR EXECUTION MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE C
FROM KRASNOYE SELO NOVEMBER 10TH 8 A.M
KRYLENKO HAD GONE TO PETER-PAUL TO TELL ADMIRAL VERDEREVSKY THAT THE MINISTRY OF MARINE WAS DESERTED AND TO BEG HIM FOR THE SAKE OF RUSSIA TO TAKE CHARGE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THE COMMITTEE SEIZED UPON THEM WITH AN EXCESS OF ZEAL ACCOMPANYING THE SEARCH WITH REMARKS LIKE AH PROVOCATORS
IT MUST ENDEAVOUR TO ORGANISE A UNIFORM SECULAR SCHOOL OF SEVERAL GRADES
THE DIRECTOR OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT LUBOVITCH WAS ARRESTED BY THE SOVIET TROOPS AND ASKED WHY HE HAD SHUT OFF THE LIGHTS
ONE RED GUARD CARRIED THREE RIFLES TWO OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN AWAY FROM YUNKERS ANOTHER HAD FOUR PORTFOLIOS BULGING WITH WRITTEN DOCUMENTS
AND WHEN HIS COMRADES HAD RETURNED FROM THE DEFENCE OF THE WINTER PALACE THEY APPOINTED HIM THEIR COMMISSAR TO GO TO SMOLNY AND OFFER THEIR SERVICES TO THE REAL REVOLUTION
ALL ALONE
THE HOLY ORTHODOX CHURCH HAD WITHDRAWN THE LIGHT OF ITS COUNTENANCE FROM MOSCOW THE NEST OF IRREVERENT VIPERS WHO HAD BOMBARDED THE KREMLIN
THIS UNION WILL FILL WITH HAPPINESS THE HEARTS OF ALL TOILERS
THE AUDIENCE SHOUTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND ALL THE GREAT MASS TOSSED AND STIRRED
THE WORKERS REVOLUTION AFTER HAVING CONQUERED IN PETROGRAD AND IN MOSCOW IS NOW CONQUERING IN ALL OTHER CENTRES OF RUSSIA
THE CENTRAL CITY COUNCILS OF TRADE UNIONS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES REPRESENT THE PROLETARIAT IN THE CORRESPONDING PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS FORMED TO ELABORATE AND CARRY OUT THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PLAN AND TO ORGANISE ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TOWNS AND THE VILLAGES WORKERS AND PEASANTS THEY ALSO POSSESS FINAL AUTHORITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES AND TRADE UNIONS SO FAR AS WORKERS CONTROL IN THEIR DISTRICT IS CONCERNED AND THEY SHALL ISSUE OBLIGATORY REGULATIONS CONCERNING WORKERS DISCIPLINE IN THE ROUTINE OF PRODUCTION--WHICH REGULATIONS HOWEVER MUST BE APPROVED BY VOTE OF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES
KERENSKY SENT THE YUNKERS TO CLOSE DOWN OUR PAPERS SOLDAT AND RABOTCHI PUT BUT OUR TROOPS WENT DOWN AND SMASHED THE GOVERNMENT SEALS AND NOW WE'RE SENDING DETACHMENTS TO SEIZE THE BOURGEOIS NEWSPAPER OFFICES EXULTANTLY HE SLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND RAN IN
IVAN PAVLOVITCH AND ANOTHER MAN--I DON'T REMEMBER HIS NAME--WELL THEY HID BEHIND THE WINDOW-CURTAINS IN THE ROOM WHERE THE STAFF WAS HAVING A MEETING AND THEY HEARD A GREAT MANY THINGS
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ENERGETIC EFFORT OF THE WORKING PEOPLE AND OF THE HONEST ENLIGHTENED INTELLECTUALS WILL LEAD THE COUNTRY OUT OF ITS PAINFUL CRISIS AND THROUGH COMPLETE DEMOCRACY TO THE REIGN OF SOCIALISM AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF NATIONS
THE LEFT ROAD ALONG WHICH THE REMNANTS OF THE COSSACKS HAD RETREATED LED UP A LITTLE HILL TO A HAMLET WHERE THERE WAS A GLORIOUS VIEW OF THE IMMENSE PLAIN GREY AS A WINDLESS SEA TUMULTUOUS CLOUDS TOWERING OVER AND THE IMPERIAL CITY DISGORGING ITS THOUSANDS ALONG ALL THE ROADS
MOSCOW HAS RALLIED TO THE NEW GOVERNMENT
OUR FIRST ACT WILL BE TO CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE ON ALL FRONTS AND A CONFERENCE OF PEOPLES TO DISCUSS DEMOCRATIC PEACE TERMS
BUT ARE THEY GENTLEMEN
EVEN AMONG THE COSSACKS THERE WAS TROUBLE
THE GARRISON IS DISAFFECTED
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES IS MENACED
SIGNED
SIGNED
COMMENCED BY TRYING TO TAX THE CAPITALISTS 100 OF THEIR PROFITS AND FINISHED--AND FINISHED BY AN ATTEMPT TO DISSOLVE THE WORKERS COMMITTEES IN THE SHOPS AND FACTORIES
IN CONSIDERING THE RISE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THAT RUSSIAN ECONOMIC LIFE AND THE RUSSIAN ARMY WERE NOT DISORGANISED ON NOVEMBER 7TH 1917 BUT MANY MONTHS BEFORE AS THE LOGICAL RESULT OF A PROCESS WHICH BEGAN AS FAR BACK AS 1915
ALSO THE OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF ALL GOVERNMENT DECREES AND ORDERS AND THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET TREATIES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS DISCOVERED IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKI TOOK IT OVER
IN VAIN ADMIRAL VERDEREVSKY THE VENERABLE MINISTER OF MARINE AND GENERAL VERKHOVSKY MINISTER OF WAR INSISTED THAT ONLY A NEW VOLUNTARY DEMOCRATIC DISCIPLINE BASED ON COOPERATION WITH THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS COMMITTEES COULD SAVE THE ARMY AND NAVY
THE COSSACK ADVANCE-GUARDS PRACTICALLY UNOPPOSED OCCUPIED PAVLOVSK ALEXANDROVSK AND OTHER STATIONS AND REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF TSARSKOYE SELO NEXT MORNING--NOVEMBER 10TH
THE PETROGRAD GARRISON HAS OVERTURNED THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY WHICH HAD RISEN AGAINST THE REVOLUTION AND THE PEOPLE
WE WENT TO A MOVING PICTURE SHOW NEAR THE KAZAN CATHEDRAL--A BLOODY ITALIAN FILM OF PASSION AND INTRIGUE
THE VIKZHEL IMMEDIATELY CALLED ITS OWN CONGRESS FOR TWO WEEKS LATER
5 HE ACCUSED NOVAYA RUS AND ROBOTCHI PUT OF BOTH DOING THE SAME KIND OF SUBVERSIVE WORK
NO ONE WILL HELP YOU UNLESS YOU ORGANISE YOURSELVES AND TAKE INTO YOUR OWN HANDS THE AFFAIRS OF THE STATE
GORBUNOV
GORBUNOV
GORBUNOV
GORBUNOV
SHAME IT IS INADMISSIBLE THAT IN THE ZONE OF MILITARY OPERATIONS THE PETROGRAD GARRISON SHALL NOT SUBMIT TO THE ORDERS OF THE STAFF
MILIUKOV'S SPEECH RESUME EVERY ONE ADMITS IT SEEMS THAT THE DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY IS OUR PRINCIPAL TASK AND THAT TO ASSURE IT WE MUST HAVE DISCIPLINE IN THE ARMY AND ORDER IN THE REAR
AGAIN PASSIONATELY HE DEMANDED THAT THE PRESS BE FREE
THE SOVIET WENT AWAY TWO DAYS AGO SAID HE
THE VICTORIOUS PROLETARIAN ARMY
COUNTER-REVOLUTION
IN THE FACTORIES THE COMMITTEE-ROOMS WERE FILLED WITH STACKS OF RIFLES COURIERS CAME AND WENT THE RED GUARD[10 DRILLED
THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS EVIL IS THE BUSINESS OF ALL HONEST PEOPLE
SAID A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RAILWAY WORKERS
AN UGLY CROWD HAD GATHERED AROUND ABUSING THE PATROL
HAVING EASILY CONQUERED THE POWER
OUR CREDENTIALS FROM SMOLNY COMMANDED IMMEDIATE RESPECT
IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS SAID ONE SULLENLY
THE RESISTANCE OF THE CAPITALISTS AND HIGH OFFICIALS WILL BE BROKEN

THE OTHER LOOKED ME OVER
IMMENSE STRIKES AND LOCK-OUTS CONVULSED MOSCOW ODESSA AND THE COAL-MINES OF THE DON
DECIDE WHAT
THE MASSES ARE SICK AND EXHAUSTED
EXPULSION FROM THE CORPS OF OFFICERS OF THOSE WHO DISHONOUR IT BY PARTICIPATING IN THE MOVEMENT OF THE SOLDIER-MASSES WHICH TEACHES THEM DISOBEDIENCE
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND WANDERED THROUGH ROOM AFTER ROOM
IMMEDIATELY IN THE BIG HALL PROCEEDINGS WERE HALTED
IN THIS TERRIBLE AND TRAGIC MOMENT THE PETROGRAD CITY DUMA IN THE FACE OF ITS CONSTITUENTS AND OF ALL RUSSIA DECLARES LOUDLY THAT IT WILL NOT SUBMIT TO ANY ENCROACHMENTS ON ITS RIGHTS AND ITS INDEPENDENCE AND WILL REMAIN AT THE POST OF RESPONSIBILITY TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN CALLED BY THE WILL OF THE POPULATION OF THE CAPITAL
HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE--NOT UNPLEASANTLY SO BUT AS IF IT HAD HARDENED THAT WAY AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF SPEAKING--AND WENT ON MONOTONOUSLY WITH THE EFFECT OF BEING ABLE TO GO ON FOREVER
PERHAPS KORNILOV WILL SOME DAY MAKE AN ATTEMPT WHAT A SERIOUS BASE FOR PROLETARIAN ACTION
AND ALSO TO FACILITATE COOPERATION WITH THE TRADE UNIONS WHICH ARE ORGANISED BY TRADES
TO YOU WHO HAVE SWORN TO GUARD INVIOLABLE YOUR OATH OF COSSACK--I CALL UPON YOU TO SAVE PETROGRAD FROM ANARCHY FROM FAMINE FROM TYRANNY AND TO SAVE RUSSIA FROM THE INDELIBLE SHAME TO WHICH A HANDFUL OF IGNORANT MEN BOUGHT BY THE GOLD OF WILHELM ARE TRYING TO SUBMIT HER
AT THIS ALL THE OTHER PAPERS SUSPENDED PUBLICATION AS A PROTEST OR DISOBEYED THE LAW AND WERE CLOSED
THE KREMLIN WHERE ARE NOW GATHERED THE MOST IMPORTANT ART TREASURES OF PETROGRAD AND OF MOSCOW IS UNDER ARTILLERY FIRE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY LEFT HOWEVER SOME SAILORS CLOSED IT AGAIN
A GREAT MOTOR-TRUCK STOOD THERE SHAKING TO THE ROAR OF ITS ENGINE
THE OLD REGIME MUST DIE
TCHERNOV WENT FROM ONE MEETING TO THE OTHER KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE ON THE PROCEEDINGS
THOSE OPPOSED TO THE LEFT
PEACE LAND AND WORKERS CONTROL OF INDUSTRY
AND AT THE END WHEN THE BOLSHEVIKI UPSET THE WHOLE HOLLOW COMPROMISE THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES FOUND THEMSELVES FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES
MY FRIEND WHO WAS A DAPPER CIVILIZED-LOOKING YOUNG MAN GAVE A CRY OF PLEASURE AND STEPPED FORWARD
HOWEVER NEEDFUL IT MAY BE TO CURTAIL OTHER ARTICLES OF THE PEOPLE'S BUDGET THE EXPENSES ON EDUCATION MUST STAND HIGH
3 INSTRUCTIONS DRAWN UP ON THE BASIS OF 242 LOCAL PEASANT NAKAZI BY THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE IZVIESTIA OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOVIET OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES AND PUBLISHED IN NO.88 OF SAID IZVIESTIA PETROGRAD NO.88 AUGUST 19TH 1917 THE LANDS OF PEASANTS AND OF COSSACKS SERVING IN THE ARMY SHALL NOT BE CONFISCATED
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET FEELS THAT AT LAST THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED WHEN THE POWER MUST FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS
APOLOGIES HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WAVED HIS ARM FOR COUNT TOLSTOY TO LEAVE
SEVERAL REGIMENTS DECEIVED BY KERENSKY HAVE SIDED WITH THE INSURGENT PEOPLE
THE INTERESTS OF PRIVATE GROUPS AND CLASSES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO A SINGLE INTEREST--THAT OF AUGMENTING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTING THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE WITH FAIRNESS
TCHUDOVSKY MONASTERY WAS HIT ABOUT THIRTY TIMES BUT ONLY ONE SHELL WENT THROUGH A WINDOW INTO THE INTERIOR THE OTHERS BREAKING THE BRICK WINDOW-MOULDING AND THE ROOF CORNICES
DO NOT BREAK THE UNITY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT BY DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE BOUND TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES TSAY-EE-KAH RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY THE DANGER IS NEAR
IT IS NOT PERMITTED ABRUPTLY HE SHOOK HANDS ALL AROUND AND WALKED AWAY
IT IS RESOLVED TO INSIST UPON THE CANDIDATURE OF COMRADES LENIN AND TROTZKY
THE SOLDIER DELEGATES PROTESTED
CHIEF COMMISSAR SECRETARY ON THE LEFT LOOMED THE LOW DARK OUTLINE OF TRUBETSKOI BASTION THAT LIVING GRAVE IN WHICH SO MANY MARTYRS OF LIBERTY HAD LOST THEIR LIVES OR THEIR REASON IN THE DAYS OF THE TSAR WHERE THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD IN TURN SHUT UP THE MINISTERS OF THE TSAR AND NOW THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD SHUT UP THE MINISTERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS REVOLUTION IS VICTORIOUS
WATCH HIM AND HIS GROUP OF COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY GENERALS CAREFULLY 20
AND SO AS TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE DIFFERENT FACTORIES OF ORDERS RAW MATERIALS FUEL TECHNICAL AND LABOUR POWER
THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS TOO INSISTED ON A PARTY CAUCUS
THE TSAY-EE-KAH WILL DEFEND THE REVOLUTION WITH ITS BODY CRIES IT WAS A DEAD BODY LONG AGO IMMENSE CONTINUED UPROAR IN WHICH HIS VOICE COULD BE HEARD SCREAMING AS HE POUNDED THE DESK THOSE WHO ARE URGING THIS ARE COMMITTING A CRIME VOICE
STILL OUR FELLOWS KEPT COMING UP LITTLE BY LITTLE UNTIL WE HAD A MAJORITY
BUT NOW THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE OFFICERS ANY MORE BECAUSE OFFICERS WERE VERY UNPOPULAR
SHOUTS WHAT
AND AS A RESULT THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE FOREVER
THE IDEA OF ABANDONING THE CAPITAL DOES NOT STIR THE INDIGNATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
THE MAYOR HE CONTINUED TELLS US THAT WE MUST NOT MAKE POLITICAL MEETINGS OUT OF THE DUMA
I DO NOT THINK THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE DONE HERE TO-DAY HE ANSWERED
FROM THE SOLDIER SECTION OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
NOW CONSCIOUS OF ITS POWER THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE PEREMPTORILY SUMMONED THE PETROGRAD STAFF TO SUBMIT TO ITS CONTROL
THERE WERE FIVE OF US TWO WOMEN PAZHAL'ST TOUARISHTCHI WAY COMRADES A SOLDIER AND A RED GUARD APPEARED IN THE DOOR WAVING THE CROWD ASIDE AND OTHER GUARDS WITH FIXED BAYONETS
RABOTCHI I SOLDAT SAID
THEY DO NOT DARE TO FIGHT THEY ARE COWARDS
THE PLACE WAS DESERTED
THEN FOR THE MEMBERS FROM PUTILOV
AT ONE OF THESE HALTS I RAN INTO NOGIN AND RYKOV THE SECEDING COMMISSARS WHO WERE RETURNING TO MOSCOW TO PUT THEIR GRIEVANCES BEFORE THEIR OWN SOVIET AND FURTHER ALONG WAS BUKHARIN A SHORT RED-BEARDED MAN WITH THE EYES OF A FANATIC--"MORE LEFT THAN LENIN THEY SAID OF HIM
ANTONOV STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND SIGNALLED A PASSING MACHINE DRIVEN BY A SOLDIER
MARTOV PLEADED FOR THEIR ADMISSION
IN THE YUNKER SCHOOLS THERE WAS FEVERISH ACTIVITY
HE WAS ESCORTING A COMMISSION OF SABOTAZHNIKI SABOTAGEURS FROM THE CITY DUMA WHO INSISTED THAT THE YUNKERS WERE ALL BEING MURDERED
THEN FOLLOWED THE CUSTOMARY STRING OF DELEGATES FROM THE MINISTRIES THE VIKZHEL THE UNION OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME REITERATING THEIR DETERMINATION NOT TO WORK FOR THE BOLSHEVIK USURPERS
COMPANIES OF RED GUARDS DISCIPLINED AND WELL-PAID WERE ON DUTY AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE WARD SOVIETS DAY AND NIGHT REPLACING THE OLD MILITIA
IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND OF A WHOLE NATION IN FERMENT AND DISINTEGRATION THAT THE PAGEANT OF THE RISING OF THE RUSSIAN MASSES UNROLLED
THE DUMA BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AND GREAT CROWDS POURING IN
THEY WILL HOWEVER BE DETAINED AT THEIR HOMES UNDER ARREST UNTIL WE HAVE INVESTIGATED THEIR COMPLICITY IN THE TREACHEROUS ACTS OF KERENSKY DURING THE KORNILOV AFFAIR NEVER SHOUTED PIANIKH IN ANY REVOLUTION HAVE SUCH THINGS BEEN SEEN AS GO ON HERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN RESPONDED TROTZKY

AT THE HEAD OF THE WIDE FORMAL STAIRWAY WHOSE WALLS WERE PLASTERED WITH ANNOUNCEMENTS OF COMMITTEE-MEETINGS AND ADDRESSES OF POLITICAL PARTIES WE PASSED THROUGH A SERIES OF LOFTY ANTE-ROOMS HUNG WITH RED-SHROUDED PICTURES IN GOLD FRAMES TO THE SPLENDID STATE SALON WITH ITS MAGNIFICENT CRYSTAL LUSTRES AND GILDED CORNICES
AS FOR THE BOLSHEVIKI HE CONFIDED TO ME THAT THEY WERE COMMON RUDE IGNORANT PERSONS WITHOUT AESTHETIC SENSIBILITIES
KARSAVINA APPEARED IN A NEW BALLET AT THE MARINSKY ALL DANCE-LOVING RUSSIA COMING TO SEE HER
THE COMMISSARS OF SMOLNY BEGAN BY PLEADING AND ARGUING WHICH DID NOT STOP THE GROWING DISORDER FOLLOWED BY PITCHED BATTLES BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND RED GUARDS
REMEMBER THE ALLIED DEMOCRACY WAS UNABLE EVEN TO CONVOKE THE STOCKHOLM CONFERENCE
BACK IN TOWN EXCITED THRONGS WERE MOVING IN TIDES UP AND DOWN THE NEVSKY
FOR GIVEN THE STATE OF MIND OF THE MASSES ANY MOVEMENT AT PETROGRAD WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE MOST TERRIBLE MASSACRES WHICH WILL COVER WITH ETERNAL SHAME THE NAME OF FREE RUSSIA
IT IS PROPAGANDA FOR ANARCHY MASSACRES AND CIVIL WAR
PAST THE HUGE FIRE BY THE GATE AND THEN THE FIRE BY THE OUTER GATE GLOWING RED ON THE FACES OF THE WORKMEN WITH RIFLES WHO SQUATTED AROUND IT AND WENT BUMPING AT TOP SPEED DOWN THE SUVOROVSKY PROSPECT SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
ALL AVAILABLE ARMS MUST BE TAKEN
SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY CALLED ESSAIRES FROM THE INITIALS OF THEIR NAME
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GUSTO BOTH SAID THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE SHOT IF THE BOLSHEVIKI CAUGHT THEM
INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENTS SPRING UP IN SIBERIA AND THE CAUCASUS
PART OF THE ARMOURED CAR DIVISION OF THE PETROGRAD GARRISM STATIONED IN THE WINTER PALACE
LONG LIVE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY 5
ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV MILITARY COMMANDER OF PETROGRAD ISSUED A PROCLAMATION
TROTZKY SEARCHED THROUGH HIS POCKETS BUT COULD FIND NO PASS
IN ORDER TO WRECK THE KERENSKY MINISTRY AND THE SOVIETS TRANSPORTATION WAS DISORGANISED AND INTERNAL TROUBLES PROVOKED
BUT IN ORDER TO LEAD THE WAVERING THE COMRADES LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THEMSELVES MUST STOP HESITATING
THEY REFUSED TO GO AND THE BATTLE FOLLOWED
THEIR BANNERS SAID LONG LIVE THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL OR WE WANT AN HONEST GENERAL DEMOCRATIC PEACE SLOWLY THE MARCHERS CAME WITH THEIR COFFINS TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE GRAVE AND THE BEARERS CLAMBERED UP WITH THEIR BURDENS AND WENT DOWN INTO THE PIT
THAT SAME AFTERNOON WAS OPENED WITH GREAT CEREMONY THE FIRST SESSION OF THE NEW COMMISSION FOR STRENGTHENING THE REPUBLICAN REGIME AND FIGHTING AGAINST ANARCHY AND COUNTER-REVOLUTION"--OF WHICH HISTORY SHOWS NOT THE SLIGHTEST FURTHER TRACE
THE COMMITTEE SAYS TO WAIT
AND MOREOVER I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE KREMLIN IS NOT AS SERIOUS AS HAS BEEN REPORTED
DIDN'T YOU EVER HEAR OF ME I'M SORRY TO SAY I NEVER DID ANSWERED THE SOLDIER WITH HUMILITY
HE'S HARMLESS NO RESPONDED THE SOLDIER WHO HAD BROUGHT THE PRISONER
NIE ZNAYU I DON'T KNOW A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG WAS A LARGE BUILDING BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED
NO COMRADES
I CANNOT SPEAK WELL TO YOU
MASSACRES AND POGROMS ON THE ONE HAND SLAVERY OF PEOPLES ON THE OTHER
THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER VIOLATED THE LIBERTY OF ALL CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO USE THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS
EVERY DAY NOVAYA RUS AND RABOTCHI PUT OPENLY INCITE TO INSURRECTION
A DEPUTY FROM THE RUSSIAN ARMY IN PERSIA DECLARED HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND ALL POWER TO THE SOVIETS
WELL NOT EXACTLY FOR KERENSKY THE COLONEL HESITATED
24 HOURS LATER ABOUT 6,000 FOLLOWED
WE WERE PROVIDED WITH PASSES FROM SMOLNY WITHOUT WHICH NO ONE COULD LEAVE THE CAPITAL
COULD WE TALK TO THE DUMA COMMISSION THEN THE COMMANDANT WHO WAS POURING HIMSELF A GLASS OF TEA NODDED
PROCEEDING FROM THE ABOVE THE TSAY-EE-KAH CATEGORICALLY REJECTS ALL PROPOSITIONS AIMING AT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE OLD REGIME IN THE DOMAIN OF THE PRESS AND UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTS THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ON THIS QUESTION AGAINST PRETENTIONS AND ULTIMATUMS DICTATED BY PETTY BOURGEOIS PREJUDICES OR BY EVIDENT SURRENDER TO THE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY BOURGEOISIE
ON OCTOBER 15TH I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A GREAT RUSSIAN CAPITALIST STEPAN GEORGEVITCH LIANOZOV KNOWN AS THE RUSSIAN ROCKEFELLER"--A CADET BY POLITICAL FAITH
WE GIVE PUBLIC WARNING THAT IF THE COSSACKS DO NOT HALT KERENSKY WHO HAS DECEIVED THEM AND IS LEADING THEM AGAINST PETROGRAD THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES WILL RISE WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE PRECIOUS CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION--PEACE AND LAND
YEDINSTVO PLEKHANOV'S PAPER YEDINSTVO SUSPENDED PUBLICATION A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE BOLSHEVIKI SEIZED THE POWER
ALL HUMANITY LONGS FOR PEACE BUT IN RUSSIA NO ONE WILL PERMIT A HUMILIATING PEACE WHICH WOULD VIOLATE THE STATE INTERESTS OF OUR FATHERLAND THE ORATOR POINTED OUT THAT SUCH A PEACE WOULD FOR LONG YEARS IF NOT FOR CENTURIES RETARD THE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN THE WORLD AND WOULD INEVITABLY CAUSE NEW WARS
EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 7TH FROM 4 A
THEN WE ARE NEUTRAL SAID HE
ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 17TH THE GREAT HALL WAS PACKED AND OMINOUS FOR THE MEETING OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH LARIN BOLSHEVIK DECLARED THAT THE MOMENT OF ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY APPROACHED AND IT WAS TIME TO DO AWAY WITH POLITICAL TERRORISM THE MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS SHOULD BE MODIFIED
BUT PEOPLE FORGET THAT UP TO NOW WE DO NOT KNOW THE TREATIES WHICH BIND THE CENTRAL POWERS GERMANY HE SAID EVIDENTLY WANTS TO SEPARATE RUSSIA FROM THE WEST BY A SERIES OF WEAK BUFFER-STATES
THE POOR LOVE EACH OTHER SO
AVANESSOV ANNOUNCED THAT BY AGREEMENT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS IT WAS DECIDED TO BASE THE PRESIDIUM UPON PROPORTIONALITY
HE MERELY ASKS THAT THE OTHER CLASSES TAKE ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER IN THE BITTER CONFLICT THAT DRAWS NEAR
HOWEVER WE WARN YOU COSSACKS
IN THE HALL I RAN INTO SOME OF THE MINOR BOLSHEVIK LEADERS
WITH JOURNALISTS STUDENTS INTELLECTUALS OF ALMOST ALL CAMPS
FIRST CAME KISHKIN HIS FACE DRAWN AND PALE THEN RUTENBERG LOOKING SULLENLY AT THE FLOOR

IF IN SOME LOCALITIES THE LAND FUND IS INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE LOCAL POPULATION THE SURPLUS POPULATION SHOULD EMIGRATE
THE PULKOVO DETACHMENT BY ITS VALOROUS BLOW HAS STRENGTHENED THE CAUSE OF THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS'S REVOLUTION
PERHAPS IT'S A GOOD THING TO LET THEM TRY--THAT WILL FURNISH THEM THE MILITARY HOTEL AT THE CORNER OF ST ISAAC'S SQUARE WAS PICKETED BY ARMED SAILORS
BUT WASN'T HE AN OFFICER AND AN OBORONOTZ HOWEVER MUCH HE TALKED OF PEACE
THE DISSOLUTION TO TAKE EFFECT NOVEMBER 30TH 1917
FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS TO THE TOILING COSSACKS BROTHERS-COSSACKS YOU ARE BEING DECEIVED
A LIE WELL IT MAY START DIFFERENTLY BUT IT WILL END THAT WAY
THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A POWER WITHOUT THE SOVIETS--AND ONLY POWERLESSNESS HAS BEEN CREATED
WHEREUPON THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO FREE
THE RESULT WAITED ON THE WORD FROM PETROGRAD
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO HE SHRUGGED
THE COMMISSARS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND THE DUMA HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THEM
BILL SHATOV[12 CAME BOUNDING UP THE STEPS
MY FAMILY IS A VERY ANCIENT AND NOBLE ONE
THE SHOOTING HAD CEASED
THE SPACIOUS LOW-CEILINGED REFECTORY DOWNSTAIRS WAS STILL A DINING-ROOM
PROVACATZIA SHOT AT US SNAPPED ONE WHILE ANOTHER WENT RUNNING TOWARD THE DOOR
I ONLY REGRET THAT I AM SO FAR FROM MY MOTHER IN BESSARABIA BAKLANOV WAS FORMALLY TAKING OVER THE OFFICE FROM THE COMMANDANT
AND THIS TRIBUNAL SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT ALSO TO RECONSIDER MEASURES OF REPRESSION ALREADY TAKEN
OCCASIONALLY AN AUTOMOBILE PASSED IN AND OUT FLYING THE RED CROSS FLAG
SECRET DIPLOMACY IS TO BE ABOLISHED
TEXT OF PLACARD IN RUSSIAN TRANSLATION FOLLOWS COMRADES FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR HEALTH PRESERVE CLEANLINESS
SHINGARIOV CADET DECLARED THAT THE MUNICIPALITY OUGHT NOT TO TAKE PART IN ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
IT WAS THE END OF THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WHICH THESE MEN HAD ATTEMPTED TO GUIDE IN CAREFUL WAYS
NOW THAT THE INSURRECTION IS OVER WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO SUPPRESS THE PAPERS OF THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES EXCEPT INASMUCH AS THEY APPEAL TO ARMED INSURRECTION OR TO DISOBEDIENCE TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
WE CROSSED OVER
I HAVE IT STILL--"_ORANIEN-BAUMSKAYA SHKOLA PRAPORSHTCHIKOV 2ND STARAYA PETERHOF WE HAD A REVIEW THIS MORNING EARLY HE WENT ON AS HE GUIDED US THROUGH THE ROOMS AND EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
THE KREMLIN IS IN THE HANDS OF THE YUNKERS AND THE WORKERS HAVE ONLY A FEW ARMS
THEY SAY THEY CAME HERE TO OBSERVE THE REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE OF THE PROLETARIAN ARMY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN WANDERING FREELY THROUGH THE PALACE AND HOW DO WE KNOW THEY HAVEN'T GOT THEIR POCKETS FULL OF LOOT PRAVILNO SNARLED THE OTHERS PRESSING FORWARD
I WAS WITH THE BOYS IN THE KREMLIN WHEN THE YUNKERS CAME THE FIRST TIME

YEDINSTVO GROUP PEASANTS UNION COOPERATIVES ZEMSTVOS MUNICIPALITIES POST AND TELEGRAPH UNIONS VIKZHEL COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC UNION OF UNIONS,[16 MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
SUCH SEPARATIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS OF RUSSIA AND THE RUSSIAN DELEGATES CANNOT RAISE THE ISSUE 9
THE ALLIED GOVERNMENTS HAD MADE NO REPLY TO THE PEACE DECREE OF NOVEMBER 8TH IN WHICH THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAD ASKED FOR A GENERAL ARMISTICE

THEY REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE--UPON WHICH KRASNOV WENT AWAY
1 WILL THE SOLDIERS AND COSSACKS OF KERENSKY RECOGNISE THE TSAY-EE-KAH AS THE REPOSITORY OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS
ULIANOV LENIN PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR MILITARY AND NAVAL AFFAIRS N
ULIANOV LENIN PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR MILITARY AND NAVAL AFFAIRS N
WE HAD TO SEND TO THE ENGLISH HOSPITAL AND BORROW SOME ARE THE MINISTERS HERE THEY ARE MEETING IN SOME ROOM--I DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE THE BOLSHEVIKI COMING OF COURSE
IN THE CITY THE GARRISON REGIMENTS WERE LEAVING THE BOLSHEVIKI THEY SAID
BUT AT SMOLNY ITSELF IN THE RANKS OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY A FORMIDABLE OPPOSITION TO LENIN'S POLICY WAS GROWING
IN THE ARCHWAY WHERE MISS BRYANT STOOD SEVEN PEOPLE WERE SHOT DEAD AMONG THEM TWO LITTLE BOYS
FREEDOM OF THE SEAS ALL STRAITS OPENING INTO INLAND SEAS AS WELL AS THE SUEZ AND PANAMA CANALS ARE TO BE NEUTRALISED
EVEN THE ARMY COMMITTEES WHO REFUSED TO CALL A MEETING OF OUR SOVIET BETRAYED US
IN EVERY VILLAGE TOWN CITY DISTRICT AND PROVINCE THERE WERE SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES PREPARED TO ASSUME THE TASK OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION
TO ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AT THE FRONT WHICH WAS REINTRODUCED BY KERENSKY
SOLDIERS
SOLDIERS
SOLDIERS
WHEN THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT HAD STEPPED DOWN PALE-FACED AND WET WITH PERSPIRATION AND STRODE OUT WITH HIS SUITE OF OFFICERS SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER FROM THE LEFT AND CENTRE ATTACKED THE RIGHT ALL ONE ANGRY ROARING
THE BOLSHEVIKI RETORTED BY PREACHING THE CLASS WAR AND BY ASSERTING THE SUPREMACY OF THE SOVIETS
ON THE WAY A MOB SET UPON ONE PARTY KILLING EIGHT MORE YUNKERS
4 DYBENKO WAS JUST COMING OUT GIVING RAPID ORDERS RIGHT AND LEFT
ON JUNE 25TH THE ORDER WAS EXECUTED
THE UNION OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES OF DIFFERENT CONCERNS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE BASIS OF THE DIFFERENT TRADES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE CONTROL OVER THE WHOLE BRANCH OF INDUSTRY SO AS TO COME WITHIN THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL PLAN
NO ONE ROSE BUT ALL SHOUTED A GREETING
THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE COUNTRY--AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY COMMERCE AND TRANSPORT--MUST BE SUBJECTED TO ONE UNIFIED PLAN CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO SATISFY THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE WIDE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE
NOW INSTEAD OF BARRACKS WE ARE BUILDING THE PERMANENT EDIFICE OF A NEW SYSTEM AND NATURALLY THE PEOPLE WILL GRADUALLY LEAVE THE BARRACKS FOR MORE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS 4
IN THE GREAT HALL TROTZKY RECOUNTED THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
YOU ARE CONTINUALLY SAYING THAT THE SOLDIER DOES NOT KNOW WHY HE IS FIGHTING AND THAT WHEN HE DOES KNOW HE'LL FIGHT
SO SPOKE MOSCOW
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE QUESTION OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS FROM THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE CLASS STRUGGLE
THE WHITE GUARD GIVES UP ITS ARMS AND DISSOLVES
THE LOSSES OF THE RED ARMY HAD BEEN HEAVY
FROM NOW ON IN THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC ALL THE ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM MUST REST ON THAT UNION
ALL MEMBERS OF THE DUMA FOR A SPECIAL MEETING WHAT'S THE MATTER I DON'T KNOW--GOING TO ARREST US--GOING TO DISSOLVE THE DUMA--ARRESTING MEMBERS AT THE DOOR SO RAN THE EXCITED COMMENTS
SINCE MARCH 1917 WHEN THE ROARING TORRENTS OF WORKMEN AND SOLDIERS BEATING UPON THE TAURIDE PALACE COMPELLED THE RELUCTANT IMPERIAL DUMA TO ASSUME THE SUPREME POWER IN RUSSIA IT WAS THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS WHICH FORCED EVERY CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF THE REVOLUTION
THE SECOND TO THE GROWING EFFORT OF PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES TO ORGANISE THE BUILDING OF NEW RUSSIA
BUT OWING TO THE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS HE ADDED THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN A POSITION TO COMBAT PRINTED LIES.[11 DECLARING THAT THESE WERE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SAME PROPAGANDA WHICH HAD FOR ITS OBJECT THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION SO ARDENTLY DESIRED BY THE DARK FORCES HE WENT ON
THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF LAND IS ABOLISHED FOREVER
OUR FACTION HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE TEXT OF THE PROCLAMATION
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THE WORKERS THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS THE POOREST PEASANTS
THE PEOPLE IN ITS STRUGGLE FOR THE POWER HAS MUTILATED OUR GLORIOUS CAPITAL
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN FRANCE OFFICIAL REPORT OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE TIME THE NEWS OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION REACHED PARIS RUSSIAN NEWSPAPERS OF EXTREME TENDENCIES IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO APPEAR
THEY HAVE ENLISTED ON THE SIDE OF KORNILOV KERENSKY AND SAVINKOV
NOW AN OLD MAN PLEKHANOV WAS EXTREMELY PATRIOTIC TOO CONSERVATIVE EVEN FOR THE MENSHEVIKI
TO CONTINUE THIS WAR IN ORDER TO PERMIT THE STRONG AND RICH NATIONS TO DIVIDE AMONG THEMSELVES THE WEAK AND CONQUERED NATIONALITIES IS CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
ADULTS TOO WILL BE ANXIOUS TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE DEBASING POSITION OF A MAN WHO CANNOT READ AND WRITE
THE CITY WAS RISING
THEY ARE READY AT ANY MOMENT TO DESTROY THE PETROGRAD SOVIET AND CRUSH THE REVOLUTION
IN THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IT CAN ONLY NEGOTIATE WITH ANY ONE WHO CONSENTS TO PARLEY
MARK MY WORDS YOUNG MAN
BUT THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO REGRET
THEFT BRIGANDAGE ASSAULTS AND ATTEMPTS AT MASSACRE WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED
THE NEW PEOPLE'S SOVIET POWER IS WILLING TO COME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THE TOILING COSSACKS
IF ANY NATION IS RETAINED BY FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ANOTHER STATE
THEORETICALLY ALL SOCIALIST PARTIES IN RUSSIA WERE IN FAVOUR OF THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE PEACE ON DEMOCRATIC TERMS
THE VILLAGES WILL SAVE US IN THE END IN THE MEANWHILE IN THE GREAT HALL USTINOV HAD ANNOUNCED THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PEASANTS CONGRESS AND SMOLNY RECEIVED BY THE DELEGATES WITH THE WILDEST JOY
BY DECREE OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
THEN HE SIGNED THE OTHER STAMPED IT WITH A ROUND SEAL TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND PRESENTED IT TO THE COLONEL
ROUGHLY THE MENSHEVIKI AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES BELIEVED THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY RIPE FOR A SOCIAL REVOLUTION--THAT ONLY A POLITICAL REVOLUTION WAS POSSIBLE
TYPICAL OF THE GROUP LIANOZOV KONOVALOV
THIS IS MERELY AN ADVENTURE ON THE PART OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE DOORS WERE GUARDED BY STUDENTS AND OFFICERS WITH WHITE ARM-BANDS LETTERED IN RED MILITIA OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND HALF A DOZEN BOY-SCOUTS CAME AND WENT
THEY THE BOLSHEVIKI DARE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES AND THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES
I HAVE NOT RISKED MY LIFE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND MORE TO SUBMIT NOW TO THE TYRANNY OF THE DARK PEOPLE
1.50 | 2.50--4.50 | 8
AT THE CENTRE OF ALL THIS OPPOSITION WAS THE DUMA AND ITS MILITANT ORGAN THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION PROTESTING AGAINST ALL THE DECREES OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS VOTING AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT TO RECOGNISE THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT OPENLY COOPERATING WITH THE NEW COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENTS SET UP AT MOGHILEV
THE COOPERATIVES WERE TORN BY INTERNAL STRUGGLES
WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN THIS MATTER NOR DO WE OBSTRUCT ANYBODY
TO CONSIDER MEANS TO ACCEPT LENIN WAS ON HIS FEET
JUST AS WE CAME TO THE MORSKAYA SOMEBODY WAS SHOUTING
THEY ARE THEREFORE RESERVED FOR ANOTHER VOLUME KORNILOV TO BREST-LITOVSK IN THIS CHAPTER THEN I HAVE CONFINED MYSELF TO THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPTS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POLITICAL POWER AT HOME AND SKETCHED ITS SUCCESSIVE CONQUESTS OF HOSTILE DOMESTIC ELEMENTS--WHICH PROCESS WAS TEMPORARILY INTERRUPTED BY THE DISASTROUS PEACE OF BREST-LITOVSK
WELL WE'RE AT WAR WITH THE CAPITALISTS TOO AND YET WE INVITE THEM INTO OUR GOVERNMENT
HERE COULD BE HAD BREAD THICKLY BUTTERED AND ENDLESS GLASSES OF TEA
THREW US OUT CRIED ONE FROM VOLIA NARODA BONCH-BRUEVITCH CAME DOWN TO THE PRESS BUREAU AND TOLD US TO LEAVE
NOW LENIN GRIPPING THE EDGE OF THE READING STAND LETTING HIS LITTLE WINKING EYES TRAVEL OVER THE CROWD AS HE STOOD THERE WAITING APPARENTLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE LONG-ROLLING OVATION WHICH LASTED SEVERAL MINUTES
THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE ALONE
THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE ALONE
THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE CAN WE GO IN THERE NO
IN THE NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC CHOSEN BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS DEPUTIES WITH PARTICIPATION OF PEASANT DEPUTIES THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS DECREES
YOU ARE ASKED TO REMAIN NEUTRAL--TO REMAIN NEUTRAL WHILE THE YUNKERS AND THE DEATH BATTALIONS WHO ARE NEVER NEUTRAL SHOOT US DOWN IN THE STREETS AND BRING BACK TO PETROGRAD KERENSKY--OR PERHAPS SOME OTHER OF THE GANG
COULD WE GO WITH THEM
THERE I EXPLAIN THE ORIGIN AND FUNCTIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS THE EVOLUTION OF POPULAR SENTIMENT THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOVIET STATE AND THE COURSE AND OUTCOME OF THE BREST-LITOVSK NEGOTIATIONS
BESIDES THE FOREGOING I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION ALMOST EVERY PROCLAMATION DECREE AND ANNOUNCEMENT POSTED ON THE WALLS OF PETROGRAD FROM THE MIDDLE OF SEPTEMBER 1917 TO THE END OF JANUARY 1918
THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN POSTPONED AND POSTPONED--WOULD PROBABLY BE POSTPONED AGAIN UNTIL THE PEOPLE WERE CALM ENOUGH--PERHAPS TO MODIFY THEIR DEMANDS
THEY MADE TOWARD THE BATTLE
MAXIMALISTS AN OFF-SHOOT OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTY IN THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 WHEN IT WAS A POWERFUL PEASANT MOVEMENT DEMANDING THE IMMEDIATE APPLICATION OF THE MAXIMUM SOCIALIST PROGRAMME
THE WORKINGMEN OF RUSSIA DID NOT HAVE THEMSELVES SHOT DOWN EXECUTED BY HUNDREDS IN MOSCOW RIGA AND ODESSA IMPRISONED BY THOUSANDS IN EVERY RUSSIAN JAIL AND EXILED TO THE DESERTS AND THE ARCTIC REGIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE DOUBTFUL PRIVILEGES OF THE WORKINGMEN OF GOLDFIELDS AND CRIPPLE CREEK
TWELFTH ARMY
ALL THE GUNS TRAINED TOWARD ST ISAAC'S
LONG LIVE THE IRON FIRMNESS OF THE PROLETARIAT
THE CATHEDRAL OF ST BASIL THE BLESSED THE CATHEDRAL OF THE ASSUMPTION ARE BEING BOMBARDED
IN THE MIDST OF DELIRIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE TOLD HOW THE CYCLE CORPS HAD BEEN ORDERED THREE DAYS BEFORE FROM THE SOUTH-WEST FRONT TO THE DEFENCE OF PETROGRAD THEY SUSPECTED HOWEVER THE MEANING OF THE ORDER
THERE IS NO FORCE IN THE WORLD WHICH CAN PUT OUT THE FIRE OF THE REVOLUTION
AS FOR THE SOCIALIST IDEAS IN THE NAKAZ WHICH HE CALLED STOCKHOLM IDEAS"--PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES AND RENUNCIATION OF THE ECONOMIC WAR THE GERMAN SUCCESSES ARE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONATE TO THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY
2 THAT WAS THE TEMPER OF THE BOLSHEVIK LEADERS
IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN BREAD FOR PETROGRAD
I REJECT THE REPROACHES AIMED AT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH ALLEGE THAT RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY DOES NOT SPEAK CLEARLY ENOUGH ABOUT THE AIMS OF THE WAR
CONSIDER COSSACKS IS THIS WRONG OR RIGHT
MOST OF THESE WERE SCRATCHED OUT AS THEIR FUTILITY BECAME EVIDENT AND THE REST OF THE SHEET COVERED WITH ABSENT-MINDED GEOMETRICAL DESIGNS AS THE WRITERS SAT DESPONDENTLY LISTENING WHILE MINISTER AFTER MINISTER PROPOSED CHIMERICAL SCHEMES
HE WAS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT ENOUGH DELEGATES WOULD COME
THEY SAID THEY HAD ENTERED THE SCHOOLS FROM THE RANKS AND GAVE THEIR NAMES--ROBERT OLEV ALEXEI VASILIENKO AND ERNI SACHS AN ESTHONIAN
MAY I COME IN ASKED THE COLONEL
AND THE ARMY ON THE FRONT WAS STARVING
THINK OF THE POORLY-CLAD PEOPLE STANDING ON THE IRON-WHITE STREETS OF PETROGRAD WHOLE DAYS IN THE RUSSIAN WINTER
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF PEASANTS SOVIETS OLD TSAY-EE-KAH CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE TSENTROFLOT MENSHEVIK SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY AND FRONT GROUP DELEGATES FROM THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS CENTRAL COMMITTEES OF THE MENSHEVIK SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY POPULIST SOCIALIST PARTIES
AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE FULL POWER MUST BE IN THE HANDS OF THE SOVIETS
THE RIGHT WING GROUPS ARE FRIGHTENED BY THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS
DAN LIEBER TSERETELLI
HE STOPPED AS HE PASSED TO SHAKE HANDS RATHER BASHFULLY
UP IN THE ALEXANDER HALL THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION HELD FORTH
DOWN WITH HIM IN THE MIDST OF WHICH THE PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR FOR MILITARY AFFAIRS CLAMBERED UP THE SIDE OF THE CAR HELPED BY HANDS BEFORE AND BEHIND PUSHED AND PULLED FROM BELOW AND ABOVE
THEY SPENT MOST OF THE DAY GOING AROUND GATCHINA FROM ONE COSSACK BARRACKS TO ANOTHER PLEADING ARGUING AND EXPLAINING
THE DUMA HAD BEEN RE-ELECTED AND WAS COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF BOLSHEVIKI
IN THE NICOLAI HALL THERE WAS BARELY ROOM TO STAND
SEEING THAT THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS UNTENABLE RESORTED TO A METHOD WHICH SINCE 1848 HAS BEEN FOR DECADES PRACTISED BY THE CAPITALISTS IN ORDER TO BEFOG DIVIDE AND FINALLY OVERPOWER THE WORKING-CLASS
NOT A SINGLE DEMOCRAT WILL SEE ANYTHING WRONG IN THIS
MORE THAN SIXTY DELEGATES HAVE ARRIVED FROM THE FRONT WITH ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT BY ALL THE ARMIES EXCEPT THE TROOPS ON THE RUMANIAN FRONT WHO HAVE NOT BEEN HEARD FROM
THE PEASANTS CONGRESS AT THE SAME TIME EXPRESSES ITS CONVICTION THAT THE COMPLETE REALISATION OF ALL THE MEASURES WHICH MAKE UP THE LAND DECREE CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL THROUGH THE TRIUMPH OF THE WORKERS SOCIAL REVOLUTION WHICH BEGAN NOVEMBER 7TH 1917
A ON THE ACCOUNTS OF MILITARY ORGANISATIONS FOR THE SATISFACTION OF THEIR NEEDS
HERE THE PROVOCATORS ALWAYS SHOOT FROM THE WINDOWS WE TURNED INTO ZNAMENSKY SQUARE DARK AND ALMOST DESERTED CAREENED AROUND TRUBETSKOY'S BRUTAL STATUE AND SWUNG DOWN THE WIDE NEVSKY THREE MEN STANDING UP WITH RIFLES READY PEERING AT THE WINDOWS
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT TCHUDNOVSKY HAD BEEN APPOINTED COMMISSAR OF THE WINTER PALACE

AND WITH THEM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS DEALT DIRECTING REVOLUTIONARY MASS-ACTION AGAINST ITS ENEMIES
MILIUTIN LABOUR A
THE POLICY OF THE BOLSHEVIKI IS DEMAGOGIC AND CRIMINAL IN THEIR EXPLOITATION OF THE POPULAR DISCONTENT
WE WILL COMPLETE THE WORK SCARCELY BEGUN IN MARCH AND ADVANCED DURING THE KORNILOV AFFAIR HE WENT ON TO SPEAK OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S FOREIGN POLICY
SAVE THE FATHERLAND
THE YUNKERS TORE FROM THEIR UNIFORMS ALL DISTINGUISHING MARKS AND ONE OFFERED WILLIAMS ANYTHING FOR THE LOAN OF HIS OVERCOAT AS A DISGUISE
IT WAS DECIDED TO INCREASE THE PRESSURE
THE POSTMEN WOULD NOT DELIVER OR ACCEPT MAIL AT SMOLNY
IS NOT THAT FAIR COSSACKS
THE PROPERTIED CLASSES HAVE ENTERED THIS PROVISION COUNCIL IN A PROPORTION WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS FROM ELECTIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE NO RIGHT HERE WHATEVER
A COMMITTEE WAS BEING ELECTED TO MEET KERENSKY AT THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE MORNING
WHATEVER BE THE MOMENT WHEN SUCH AN ANNEXATION BY FORCE WAS ACCOMPLISHED WHATEVER BE THE DEGREE CIVILISATION OF THE NATION ANNEXED BY FORCE OR MAINTAINED OUTSIDE THE FRONTIERS OF ANOTHER STATE NO MATTER IF THAT NATION BE IN EUROPE OR IN THE FAR COUNTRIES ACROSS THE SEA
APPEALS AND COUNTER-APPEALS FROM THE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE AND PRIVATE BANKS TO THE POPULATION OF PETROGRAD COMRADES WORKERS SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS
OTHERS RELIEVED WOUNDED OR COMING TO SMOLNY FOR ARMS AND EQUIPMENT POURED IN
THEN A WORKMAN FROM VASILI OSTROV BUT HIM THEY GREETED WITH AND ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US PEACE WORKING-MAN NEAR US SOME MEN MANY OF THEM OFFICERS FORMED A SORT OF CLAQUE TO CHEER THE ADVOCATES OF NEUTRALITY
HERE THE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIAL REVOLUTIONARY LEADERS--AVKSENTIEVS DANS LIEBERS,--THE FORMER SOCIALIST MINISTERS--SKOBELIEVS TCHERNOVS,--RUBBED SHOULDERS WITH CADETS LIKE OILY SHATSKY SLEEK VINAVER
YOU HERE I ASKED HIM
FIRING HE SAID
BUT AS A VETERAN REVOLUTIONIST I APPEAL TO YOU YOUNG REVOLUTIONISTS TO REMAIN AT YOUR POSTS AND DEFEND THE CONQUESTS OF THE REVOLUTION ORDERS OF KISHKIN NOVEMBER 7TH
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE MINISTRY OF SUPPLIES TO THE TCHINOVNIKI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IT IS NOTIFIED HEREBY THAT ALL OFFICIALS AND PERSONS WHO HAVE QUITTED THE SERVICE IN GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OR HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOR SABOTAGE OR FOR HAVING FAILED TO REPORT FOR WORK ON THE DAY FIXED AND WHO HAVE NEVERTHELESS RECEIVED THEIR SALARY PAID IN ADVANCE FOR THE TIME THEY HAVE NOT SERVED ARE BOUND TO RETURN SUCH SALARY NOT LATER THAN ON NOVEMBER 27TH 1917 TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS WHERE THEY WERE IN SERVICE
WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT AH THE LAND DECREE HE SAID FURIOUSLY
NO FOREIGN POLICY NO ART OF DIPLOMACY AN IMMEDIATE DEMOCRATIC PEACE A DECLARATION TO THE ALLIES WE WANT NOTHING WE HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO FIGHT WITH AND THEN OUR ADVERSARIES WILL MAKE THE SAME DECLARATION AND THE BROTHERHOOD OF PEOPLES WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED MILIUKOV TOOK A FLING AT THE ZIMMERWALD MANIFESTO AND DECLARED THAT EVEN KERENSKY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE THE INFLUENCE OF THAT UNHAPPY DOCUMENT WHICH WILL FOREVER BE YOUR INDICTMENT HE THEN ATTACKED SKOBELIEV WHOSE POSITION IN FOREIGN ASSEMBLIES WHERE HE WOULD APPEAR AS A RUSSIAN DELEGATE YET OPPOSED TO THE FOREIGN POLICY OF HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD BE SO STRANGE THAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY WHAT'S THAT GENTLEMAN CARRYING AND WHAT SHALL WE TALK TO HIM ABOUT AS FOR THE NAKAZ MILIUKOV SAID THAT HE HIMSELF WAS A PACIFIST
THE QUESTION IS VERY PLAIN
THE CAR LUMBERED UP TO THE STEPS OF THE DUMA AND A MAN STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF THE TURRET DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE SOLDATSKI GOLOS THE BOY-SCOUTS JEERED AND SCUTTLED INTO THE BUILDING
THE LOCAL SOVIET ALSO WITHDREW TO THE VILLAGE OF PULKOVO
NO SAID ONE
TCHEIDZE THE OLD EAGLE WHO HAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY RETIRED TO HIS OWN GEORGIAN MOUNTAINS THERE TO SICKEN WITH CONSUMPTION
WE CONSENT TO EXAMINE ALL CONDITIONS OF PEACE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHALL ACCEPT THEM
HE TALKED RAPIDLY AND STEADILY FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR
YOU SHOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL
YOU SHOULD REMAIN NEUTRAL
IN THE HALLS THEY WERE PASTING UP BULLETINS
THE MINISTRIES ARE ON STRIKE AND BREAD IS GETTING SCARCER
7)--LOOTING OF THE WINE-CELLARS--BEGINNING WITH THE PLUNDERING OF THE WINTER PALACE VAULTS
SO THAT EVEN THE MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS POINTED OUT THAT THE DUMA OUGHT TO BE RE-ELECTED AS IT NO LONGER REPRESENTED THE POLITICAL COMPOSITION OF THE PETROGRAD POPULATION
ON THE 17TH OF NOVEMBER FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION ADDRESSED ALL MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS ZEMSTVOS AND ALL DEMOCRATIC AND REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS OF PEASANTS WORKERS SOLDIERS AND OTHER CITIZENS IN THESE WORDS
PASS TO REED FROM DEPARTMENT OF PRISONS TRANSLATION FOLLOWS PASS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PRISONS OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT TO VISIT FREELY ALL PRISONS OF PETROGRAD AND CRONSTADT
WITH THE SANCTION OF ALEXINSKY AND KERENSKY PUT SOME OF THE BEST WORKERS OF THE REVOLUTION SOLDIERS AND SAILORS IN PRISON
TWO RED GUARDS WERE BENDING OVER HIM BUT THE REST OF THE COMPANY DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION
THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS ARE A NATIONALISTIC PARTY
AND THEN BEING CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS INFLUENCE IN FRANCE THEY WERE ORDERED TO SALONIKA
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SUDDENLY DUKHONIN HIMSELF APPEARED AT THE WINDOW AS IF TO ADDRESS THE THRONG
ALL PRIVILEGES CONNECTED WITH THE FORMER RANKS AND GRADES ALSO ALL OUTWARD MARKS OF DISTINCTION ARE ABOLISHED
ITS DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE WORKERS IS CARRIED OUT BY THE LOCAL AND CENTRAL ORGANS OF ADMINISTRATION BEGINNING WITH THE VILLAGE DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS AND ENDING WITH THE CENTRAL PROVINCIAL INSTITUTIONS--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF URBAN AND RURAL COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES
BUT MORE THAN THAT
AVKSENTIEV
BUT THE DOMINANT WORKER AND SOLDIER DID NOT BELIEVE THEM
3 THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION DECLARED DIELO NARODA SAID THE MENSHEVIK DIEN THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AND DEFEND US PLEKHANOV'S PAPER YEDINSTVO UNITY SEE APP
SEVERAL MENSHEVIKI LEAPED TO THEIR FEET PROTESTING
PRESERVE FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR DESCENDANTS THE BEAUTY OF OUR LAND
ONLY ONE THING--WE HAVE NO AMMUNITION IN SMOLNY THERE ARE TWO BILLION ROUNDS ANTONOV TOLD HIM
WHERE DOES SUCH AN ACCUSATION COME FROM
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LAST WARNING
WHEN THE TRENCHES HEAR OF THIS THEY WILL CRY THIS IS OUR GOVERNMENT A YUNKER FROM PETERHOF SAID THAT HE AND TWO OTHERS HAD REFUSED TO MARCH AGAINST THE SOVIETS
NEVERTHELESS IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN ALL THE PAPERS AND POSTED ON ALL THE WALLS
AT MOSCOW SAID THE CADET PAPER RYETCH SPEECH THE GOVERNMENT CAN PURSUE ITS WORK IN A TRANQUIL ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT BEING INTERFERED WITH BY ANARCHISTS RODZIANKO LEADER OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE CADET PARTY DECLARED IN UTRO ROSSII THE MORNING OF RUSSIA THAT THE TAKING OF PETROGRAD BY THE GERMANS WOULD BE A BLESSING BECAUSE IT WOULD DESTROY THE SOVIETS AND GET RID OF THE REVOLUTIONARY BALTIC FLEET
THE YUNKERS TELEPHONED FOR HELP
THE MUNICIPALITIES MAY CREATE HOUSING TRIBUNALS DEFINE THEIR POWERS AND THEIR AUTHORITY
LATER THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD OF ANOTHER FRENCH OFFICER CAPTURED IN A YUNKER ARMOURED CAR AND SENT TO PETER-PAUL
ALL ARE EQUAL
THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH OF THE MUNICIPAL DUMA OF THE AVKSENTIEV PEASANTS SOVIETS AND OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES FROM THE BOLSHEVIKI TO THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS WERE INVITED TO THE MEETING
FIRST THE PEASANTS WITHOUT LAND WHO EXPRESS THEIR WISH TO EMIGRATE
IN THE SPELLING OF RUSSIAN NAMES AND WORDS I HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW ANY SCIENTIFIC RULES FOR TRANSLITERATION BUT HAVE TRIED TO GIVE THE SPELLING WHICH WOULD LEAD THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING READER TO THE SIMPLEST APPROXIMATION OF THEIR PRONUNCIATION
MAYOR SCHREIDER ANNOUNCED THAT BECAUSE OF THE BOLSHEVIK INSURRECTION THE ELECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE TO BE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
HERE SAID THE COLONEL POINTING TO PENCIL MARKS WERE OUR POSITIONS THIS MORNING
MOST OF THEM SEEMED TO BE MERE BOYS
THE ORDER OF THE MERGER OF PRIVATE BANKS IN THE STATE BANK IS TO BE DETERMINED BY A SPECIAL DECREE
THE MINISTER DID NOT MENTION ALL THIS 5
THAT HE SAID IS FOR YOU TO DO
THE DELEGATE OF THE FIFTH ARMY PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR DYBENKO
MURAVIOV
SO FINALLY WE MARCHED THEM UP TO THE FINLAND STATION AND PUT THEM ON A TRAIN FOR LEVASHOVO WHERE THEY HAVE A CAMP
ATTEMPTS TO LOOT WINE-CELLARS WAREHOUSES FACTORIES STORES BUSINESS PREMISES PRIVATE DWELLINGS ETC ETC WILL BE STOPPED BY MACHINE-GUN FIRE WITHOUT WARNING 4
BUT THE REAL DEFEATISTS ARE THOSE WHO WAIT FOR A MORE PROPITIOUS MOMENT TO CONCLUDE PEACE INSIST UPON POSTPONING PEACE UNTIL LATER UNTIL NOTHING IS LEFT OF THE RUSSIAN ARMY UNTIL RUSSIA BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF BARGAINING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT IMPERIALIST GROUPS
ON THE THIRD DAY LENIN SUDDENLY MOUNTED THE TRIBUNE
CONCERNING THE GERMAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATS I HAVE JUST TALKED WITH COMRADE GOLDENBERG ONE OF OUR DELEGATES TO STOCKHOLM
AT PRESENT THE INFLUENCE OF OUR VICTORY IS CREATING NEW POLITICAL CONDITIONS
I HURRIED DOWN TO THE MARINSKY PALACE ARRIVING AT THE END OF THAT PASSIONATE AND ALMOST INCOHERENT SPEECH OF KERENSKY'S FULL OF SELF-JUSTIFICATION AND BITTER DENUNCIATION OF HIS ENEMIES
CAN IT GIVE BREAD TO THE PEOPLE
WE THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ADDRESS OURSELVES TO YOU COSSACKS WITH THESE WORDS
16 SEE NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
TRY IT CHEERS AND WHISTLING NOW CONCERNING OUR POLICY ABOUT PEACE LAUGHTER UNFORTUNATELY RUSSIA CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR
RUTENBURG OF THE BLACK BAND WHO SABOTAGED THE MUNICIPAL FOOD SUPPLY
ALL ASSEMBLIES OR MEETINGS IN THE STREETS AND GENERALLY IN THE OPEN AIR ARE FORBIDDEN UNTIL FURTHER ORDERS
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS MEETING AND NEXT DOOR THE NEW TSAY-EE-KAH ACTING ON THE DECREES AND ORDERS SEE APP
SUCH AN AGREEMENT WOULD BE ILLEGAL SEEING THAT THE TRUE CONGRESS OF PEASANTS SOVIETS DOES NOT MEET UNTIL NEXT WEEK
SINCE IT CAME TO POWER HAS THERE BEEN A SINGLE ORDER ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF HALTING ANARCHY OR HAS ANY ONE ATTEMPTED TO PUT OUT THE RUSSIAN CONFLAGRATION
LET'S GO ON THROUGH AND ATTACK THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR CAME OVER AND SHOUTED SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ROARING ENGINE
FROM FAR KRASNOYARSK IN SIBERIA CAME NEWS THAT THE SOVIETS WERE IN CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS
ITS LEADERS WERE NOBLES AND GREAT LAND-OWNERS LIKE KALEDIN KORNILOV GENERALS DUTOV KARAULOV AND BARDIZHE AND IT WAS BACKED BY THE POWERFUL MERCHANTS AND BANKERS OF MOSCOW
A FEW MINUTES LATER ANOTHER WITH ARMED SOLDIERS ON THE FRONT SEAT FULL OF ARRESTED MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT
SEE PARAGRAPH 5B AMONG THE LEADERS
JUST AS RUSSIAN POLITICS SWUNG BODILY TO THE LEFT--UNTIL THE CADETS WERE OUTLAWED AS ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE KERENSKY BECAME A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONIST THE MIDDLE SOCIALIST LEADERS TSERETELLI DAN LIEBER GOTZ AND AVKSENTIEV WERE TOO REACTIONARY FOR THEIR FOLLOWING AND MEN LIKE VICTOR TCHERNOV AND EVEN MAXIM GORKY BELONGED TO THE RIGHT WING
THESE PLACES WERE NOT EVEN ENTERED
ON THE ORDER IN WHICH THE LAWS ARE TO BE RATIFIED AND PUBLISHED 1
BUT IN ANY CASE WHICHEVER SIDE WINS THE DUMA WILL ALWAYS BE AGAINST LYNCHINGS AND TORTURE KONOVSKI CADET A TALL OLD MAN WITH A CRUEL FACE
ACCORDING TO ORDERS WE OCCUPIED THE POSITION ALONG THIS ROAD
IN DRAWING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE TEXT APPROVED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF THE PROPOSITION FOR AN ARMISTICE AND A DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT ANNEXATIONS OR INDEMNITIES BASED ON THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES I HAVE THE HONOUR TO REQUEST YOU TO CONSIDER THAT DOCUMENT AS A FORMAL PROPOSAL OF AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE ON ALL FRONTS AND THE OPENING OF IMMEDIATE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
WORD WAS EVEN SPREAD AMONG THE PEASANTS THAT THE CONGRESS WOULD MEET AT MOGHILEV AND SOME DELEGATES WENT THERE
FOR THIS THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS HAD DIED IN THE PRISONS IN EXILE IN SIBERIAN MINES
YOU ARRESTED OUR SOCIALIST PEASANTS--WHY NOT ARREST THEM THIS WAS THE SIGNAL FOR A DEBATE OF EXCITED PEASANTS
THERE ORDER WAS ALSO BEING ESTABLISHED
THE FOOTNOTES ARE INCLUDED AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER WHILE THE APPENDIX NO
ENTERING THE MEETING-ROOM OF THE STAFF WHERE KISHKIN RUTENBURG PALTCHINSKI GENERAL BAGRATOUNI COLONEL PARADIELOV AND COUNT TOLSTOY WERE GATHERED THEY DEMANDED THE IMMEDIATE SURRENDER OF THE STAFF
IT HAPPENED EARLY THIS MORNING
THE BIG RED GUARD WHOSE NAME WAS VLADIMIR NICOLAIEVITCH PLIED ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT AMERICA
WHEREVER IT SHALL BE NECESSARY FOR THIS PURPOSE TO STOP WORK AT THE FACTORIES THIS SHALL BE DONE IMMEDIATELY
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN THE LOBBY WERE GREAT TABLES HEAPED WITH STACKS OF APPEALS PROCLAMATIONS AND ORDERS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
WRITE A LETTER TO THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR A REGISTERED LETTER WITH RECEIPT DEMANDED
A DEEP UNEASY SOUND CAME TO MY EARS AND LOOKING AROUND I NOTICED THAT EVERYWHERE ON THE FLOOR ALONG THE WALLS MEN WERE SLEEPING
BUT THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANTS'S SOVIETS AND THE POPULIST SOCIALISTS FLATLY REFUSED TO ADMIT THE BOLSHEVIKI
THERE REMAINED SEVERAL CENTRES OF DANGEROUS OPPOSITION SUCH AS THE REPUBLICS OF UKRAINE AND FINLAND WHICH WERE SHOWING DEFINITELY ANTI-SOVIET TENDENCIES
I SEE NO REASON TO DOUBT TRUSISHKA'S STORY OF THE JOURNEY
THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM THE DELEGATES TO THE FIRST SIEZD CONGRESS SHE REMARKED
THE HIGH COMMAND BEING ON THE SIDE OF KERENSKY IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING STRONGER THE MAJORITY OF THE RANK AND FILE WITH THE SOVIETS AND THE REST UNHAPPILY WAVERING
THE HEAVY TRUCK SWAYING FROM SIDE TO SIDE
HOW FAR THEY HAD SOARED THESE BOLSHEVIKI FROM A DESPISED AND HUNTED SECT LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AGO TO THIS SUPREME PLACE THE HELM OF GREAT RUSSIA IN FULL TIDE OF INSURRECTION
NERATOV RUNS--TROTZKY PURSUES
TWO COMPANIES ON DUTY IN THE KREMLIN HAVE GONE OVER TO THE SOVIETS BUT THE ARSENAL IS IN THE HANDS OF COLONEL DIABTSEV AND HIS YUNKERS THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DEMANDED ARMS FOR THE WORKERS AND RIABTSEV PARLEYED WITH THEM UNTIL THIS MORNING WHEN SUDDENLY HE SENT AN ULTIMATUM TO THE COMMITTEE ORDERING SOVIET TROOPS TO SURRENDER AND THE COMMITTEE TO DISBAND
THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE OF THE CONFUSED EVENTS OF THOSE FEVERISH DAYS WHEN EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT NOBODY KNEW JUST WHAT
THE MINISTER HAS IN HIS POSSESSION VERY IMPORTANT DECLARATIONS
TCHERNOV
BUT WHEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT SURROUNDING SMOLNY THEN IVAN PAVLOVITCH COULDN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER
UNLIKE IN PETROGRAD IN MOSCOW THE CITY DUMA HAD TAKEN COMMAND OF THE YUNKERS AND WHITE GUARDS
THE NEWSPAPERS WERE AS VIOLENT
THOSE WHO VIOLATE THIS ORDER WILL BE ARRESTED AND GIVEN TRIAL BEFORE A MERCILESS COURT AND THEIR PROPERTY WILL BE CONFISCATED AND THE STOCK OF WINE DISCOVERED WILL BE BLOWN UP WITH DYNAMITE 2 HOURS AFTER THIS WARNING BECAUSE MORE LENIENT MEASURES AS EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN DO NOT BRING THE DESIRED RESULTS
THE RUSSIAN VILLAGES UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY ARE NOW CARRYING OUT THEIR OWN MEASURES
WE CANNOT HAVE OUR INNOCENT BLOOD UPON THE HANDS OF THESE IGNORANT MEN
KONOVALOV MINISTER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY IN HE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN SCRATCHED OUT AS THE HOPELESSNESS OF THE SITUATION BECAME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT
THE NAKAZ TO SKOBELIEV IS BAD
HE WAS VERY RED IN THE FACE
THE FIRST WEEKS ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT ONES
YES HE ANSWERED BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO--LIKE THE TSAY-EE-KAH_--LIKE THE ARMY COMMITTEE THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW CONGRESS OF SOVIETS THEY YELLED AT HIM
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE MANIFESTATION
ON THE 11TH COSSACK OUTPOSTS REACHED KRASNOYE SELO FROM WHICH THE LOCAL SOVIET AND THE HETEROGENEOUS FORCES OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE PRECIPITATELY RETIRED SOME OF THEM SURRENDERING
2 ABOUT WHEN CAN WE COUNT ON YOUR ARRIVAL AT PETROGRAD
OUR ONLY ORGAN ZNAMIA TRUDA BANNER OF LABOUR WAS FORBIDDEN TO APPEAR YESTERDAY
6 AND PROCLAMATIONS PASTED IN EVERY FLAT PLACE
IT WAS RABOTCHI I SOLDAT ANNOUNCING THE VICTORY OF THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION THE LIBERATION OF THE BOLSHEVIKI STILL IN PRISON CALLING UPON THE ARMY FRONT AND REAR FOR SUPPORT
SACK IN HIS BOOK THE BIRTH OF THE RUSSIAN DEMOCRACY SAYS
IN 1917 THERE WERE MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN CONSUMERS COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES
IT IS ONLY NECESSARY THAT THE COSSACKS THEMSELVES SHOULD RESOLVE TO ABOLISH THE OLD ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD REFUSE SUBMISSION TO THEIR SLAVE-DRIVER OFFICERS LAND-OWNERS RICH MEN THAT THEY SHOULD THROW OFF THE CURSED YOKE FROM THEIR NECKS
AND AT THE HEAD WHITE-BEARDED OLD SCHREIDER MAYOR OF PETROGRAD AND PROKOPOVITCH MINISTER OF SUPPLIES IN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ARRESTED THAT MORNING AND RELEASED
AVKSENTIEV GOTZ KERENSKY TCHERNOV BABUSCHKA BRESHKOVSKAYA
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED THE PROCLAMATION WHICH THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING TO THE REGIMENTS
ONLY AS THE RESULT OF SUCH A UNION CAN THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA BE CEMENTED INTO ONE REVOLUTIONARY FORCE ABLE TO RESIST ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE IMPERIALIST-ANNEXATIONIST BOURGEOISIE
TROTZKY THE OTHER SOLDIER SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
DRESSED IN SHABBY CLOTHES HIS TROUSERS MUCH TOO LONG FOR HIM
THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY DISCUSSES AND HESITATES
STOLBIKOV A
I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE THORNTON WOOLLEN MILLS AN ENGLISH CONCERN ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETROGRAD THAT WHILE WAGES HAD INCREASED ABOUT 300 PER CENT IN HIS FACTORY HIS PROFITS HAD GONE UP 900 PER CENT 3
THE GOVERNMENT MUST PLAY ITS PART IN THIS AFFAIR
OTHERWISE TROUBLES WITH THE RIGHT WILL FOLLOW TROUBLES FROM THE LEFT
THE LACK OF ARMS ON THE FRONT WHICH HAD CAUSED THE GREAT RETREAT OF THE SUMMER OF 1915 THE LACK OF FOOD IN THE ARMY AND IN THE GREAT CITIES THE BREAK-DOWN OF MANUFACTURES AND TRANSPORTATION IN 1916--ALL THESE WE KNOW NOW WERE PART OF A GIGANTIC CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE
BY THE WILL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE I HAVE BEEN APPOINTED PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR OF EDUCATION
STATE PRINTING OFFICE GHERBYCHEV
HE PROPOSES TO THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE INSURRECTIONISTS TO RECALL ITS REGIMENTS TO PETROGRAD TO DECLARE THE LINE LIGOVO-PULKOVO-COLPINNO NEUTRAL AND TO ALLOW THE ADVANCE-GUARDS OF THE GOVERNMENT CAVALRY TO ENTER TSARSKOYE SELO FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING ORDER
THE GOLD AND RED EPAULETTES OF OFFICERS WERE CONSPICUOUS THE FAMILIAR FACES OF THE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY INTELLECTUALS THE HARD EYES AND BULKY MAGNIFICENCE OF BANKERS AND DIPLOMATS OFFICIALS OF THE OLD REGIME AND WELL-DRESSED WOMEN
COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV WAS IN COMMAND OF THEIR FORCES AND THE ORDERS WERE SIGNED BY GOTZ FORMER MEMBER OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED AT LIBERTY ON HIS WORD OF HONOUR
FORBIDDING OF ALL POLITICAL PROPAGANDA
MENSHEVIKI THIS PARTY INCLUDES ALL SHADES OF SOCIALISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY MUST PROGRESS BY NATURAL EVOLUTION TOWARD SOCIALISM AND THAT THE WORKING-CLASS MUST CONQUER POLITICAL POWER FIRST
WE WENT UNEVENTFULLY FORWARD UNTIL THE TREES BEGAN TO THIN AND PAUSED
THIS STATE OF THINGS IS DISORGANISING THE LIFE OF THE CITIZENS AND HINDERS THE SYSTEMATIC WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS
THE FIRST ACTION IS USUALLY THE ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND THE PRESIDIUM THE PRESIDIUM IS A PRESIDING COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GROUPS AND POLITICAL FACTIONS REPRESENTED IN THE ASSEMBLY IN PROPORTION TO THEIR NUMBERS
A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE POST AND TELEGRAPH EMPLOYEES CAME IN
ALL THE BANK-CLERKS IN RUSSIA HAVE BEEN BRIBED TO STOP WORK
THE BOURGEOIS AND REACTIONARY PRESS PROPHESIED INSURRECTION AND URGED THE GOVERNMENT TO ARREST THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OR AT LEAST TO PREVENT THE MEETING OF THE CONGRESS
THE MEETING WAS CALLED UPON THE INITIATIVE OF THE PREOBRAZHENSKY AND SEMIONOVSKY REGIMENTS FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION AS TO WHICH SOCIALIST PARTIES ARE FOR THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS WHICH ARE AGAINST WHICH ARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHICH AGAINST AND IF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM IS POSSIBLE
IN THE NAME OF LIBERTY LAND AND PEACE UNITE AROUND THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION OF COUNTRY AND REVOLUTION
THE RUSSKAYA VOLIA HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE STATIONS WERE FILLED WITH BREAD AFTER THE PEASANTS RISING
THE SECRETARY OF THE REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE WAS THERE SO WE TOLD HIM AND ASKED WHAT TO DO
IN THE UPSTAIRS CAFE SAT A MAN ALL BY HIMSELF IN THE CORNER IN A GOAT-SKIN CAPE AND CLOTHES WHICH HAD BEEN--I WAS GOING TO SAY SLEPT IN BUT OF COURSE HE HADN'T SLEPT--AND A THREE DAYS GROWTH OF BEARD
THEY PROPOSED THAT WE HOLD A JOINT FUNERAL WITH THE YUNKERS GRAPHIC PAGE 251
WHEN THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE WAS OCCUPIED BY THE YUNKERS COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV ORDERED THE TELEPHONES TO SMOLNY DISCONNECTED BUT I PROTESTED AND THE TELEPHONES WERE KEPT GOING AT THIS THERE WAS IRONIC LAUGHTER FROM THE BOLSHEVIK BENCHES AND IMPRECATIONS FROM THE RIGHT
THE COMMISSARS OF SMOLNY RACED THE COMMISSARS OF THE CITY DUMA ON SPEEDING TRAINS HALF ACROSS THE EARTH
THE FREE AND ENFRANCHISED PEOPLES OF RUSSIA WILL NOT FORGET THIS
OR A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY LIKE ENGLAND
I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AT SMOLNY
A MOB AGAINST TRAINED SOLDIERS SOUTH AND SOUTH-WEST THE SOVIETS HAD FLED BEFORE KERENSKY AND THE GARRISONS OF GATCHINA PAVLOVSK TSARSKOYE SELO WERE DIVIDED--HALF VOTING TO REMAIN NEUTRAL THE REST WITHOUT OFFICERS FALLING BACK ON THE CAPITAL IN THE WILDEST DISORDER
DECREES ON THE NATIONALISATION OF THE BANKS IN THE INTEREST OF THE REGULAR ORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY OF THE THOROUGH ERADICATION OF BANK SPECULATION AND THE COMPLETE EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKERS PEASANTS AND THE WHOLE LABOURING POPULATION FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF BANKING CAPITAL AND WITH A VIEW TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE NATIONAL BANK OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC WHICH SHALL SERVE THE REAL INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE POORER CLASSES THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TSAY-EE-KAH RESOLVES
ON THE 4TH OF NOVEMBER SOMEBODY IS ORGANISING A COSSACK RELIGIOUS PROCESSION
THE ELECTED COMMANDERS ABOVE THE RANK OF COMMANDER OF REGIMENT MUST BE CONFIRMED BY THE NEAREST SUPREME COMMITTEE
I GALLOP THE DEVILS SHOOTING ALL AROUND
THEIR ARBITRARY ACTS THEIR ANNULLING OF OUR ORDERS MAY LEAD TO A CATASTROPHE
WHEN YOU CALLED CENTRAL SHOOTING COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD OVER THE WIRE
IT IS A PRIVATE DOCUMENT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
AT THE WESTERN CORNER OF THE PALACE LAY A BIG ARMOURED CAR WITH A RED FLAG FLYING FROM IT NEWLY LETTERED IN RED PAINT
LENIN SPOKE
RESIGNATION HE INSISTED THAT THE DELEGATES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH TO PARIS SHOULD HAVE A COMMON POINT OF VIEW--HIS OWN
THE DUMA'S PROCLAMATION WAS DOING ITS WORK
ON THE CONTRARY HE WILL BE ASSISTED
THE BOOK IS COMPOSED OF TEXT FOOTNOTES AND APPENDICES
THE MEETING WAS ADJOURNED BECAUSE OF THE NOISE AND DISORDER
THE PROPOSAL TO ABANDON PETROGRAD RAISED A HURRICANE
THAT FACT IS THE MOST STRIKING PROOF THAT WE WERE NOT ISOLATED IN REALITY THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS ISOLATED
MORE THAN A HUNDRED RED GUARDS AND SOLDIERS HAD FALLEN
ALSO ORDERS ONE GIVING THE MUNICIPAL DUMA POWER TO REQUISITION EMPTY APARTMENTS AND HOUSES THE OTHER DIRECTING THE UNLOADING OF FREIGHT CARS IN THE RAILROAD TERMINALS TO HASTEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF NECESSITIES AND TO FREE THE BADLY-NEEDED ROLLING-STOCK
THE LIFE OF THE CITY GREW GAY AND THE VERY REVOLUTION RAN SWIFTER
ULIANOV LENIN EXECUTIVE OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS V
THE CENTRAL ARMY COMMITTEE ISSUED A DECLARATION IN FAVOUR OF DUKHONIN
THEY PROMISED THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND THEN ARRESTED THE LAND COMMITTEES
WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DISASTROUS POLICY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE CARRIED ON AGAINST THE WILL OF AN ENORMOUS MAJORITY OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE SOLDIERS WHO ARE EAGER TO SEE THE RAPID END OF THE BLOODSHED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE DEMOCRACY
HE COULD NOT PROCEED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
INSIDE ONLY A SINGLE ARC-LIGHT BURNED DIMLY HIGH UP NEAR THE ROOF OF THE ENORMOUS HALL WHOSE LOFTY PILASTERS AND ROWS OF WINDOWS VANISHED IN THE GLOOM
ALL REGIMENTAL DIVISION AND BATTLE-SHIP COMMITTEES TOGETHER WITH THE SOVIET COMMISSARS AND ALL REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS SHALL MEET IN CONTINUOUS SESSION CONCENTRATING IN THEIR HANDS ALL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANS OF THE CONSPIRATORS
THE CITY IS CUT OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND IS ENTIRELY IN THE POWER OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
DOWN WITH THE TRAITOROUS BARRICADES
BACKED BY THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS WE SHALL GO ON AT FIVE MINUTES PAST SEVEN CAME WORD FROM THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES TO SAY THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN IN THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
RUMANIA MUST BE FORCED TO EXECUTE THE CLAUSES OF THE BERLIN TREATY CONCERNING THE JEWS AND RECOGNISE THEM AS RUMANIAN CITIZENS
HIM THEY LISTENED TO MUTTERING UNEASILY FEELING HIM NOT ONE OF THEM
ALL OF FROM THE SMALLEST TO THE GREATEST MUST REDOUBLE THEIR EFFORTS MUST ENDEAVOUR TO ARRANGE THINGS PROPERLY
OUTSIDE THE ALEXANDER HALL WAS CROWDED FOR THE MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND SKOBELIEV WAS AGAIN SPEAKING
OR--THE POWER WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS
OUR PARTY HAS REFUSED TO ENTER THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WISH FOREVER TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THE PART OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WHICH LEFT THE CONGRESS A SEPARATION WHICH WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SERVE AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE OTHER GROUPS OF THE DEMOCRACY
THE MINISTRIES WERE ON STRIKE
LONG LIVE OUR BRAVE ALLIES 13
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY THE DISPERSAL OF THE SOVIET AT KALUGA
OF THIS I HAVE AN ALMOST COMPLETE FILE FROM THE SPRING OF 1917 TO THE END OF JANUARY 1918
FAR AWAY STILL SOUNDED OCCASIONAL SHOTS BUT THE CITY LAY QUIET COLD AS IF EXHAUSTED BY THE VIOLENT SPASMS WHICH HAD TORN IT
ON THE 3RD THE LEADERS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD ANOTHER HISTORIC MEETING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
RESOLVED THAT THE REGIMENT REMAIN NEUTRAL AND CONTINUE ITS PRESENT ACTIVITIES--WHICH CONSISTED IN PEDDLING RUBBERS AND SUNFLOWER SEEDS
A CROWD CAME POURING DOWN THE STAIRCASE WORKERS IN BLACK BLOUSES AND ROUND BLACK FUR HATS MANY OF THEM WITH GUNS SLUNG OVER THEIR SHOULDERS SOLDIERS IN ROUGH DIRT-COLOURED COATS AND GREY FUR SHAPKI PINCHED FLAT A LEADER OR SO--LUNATCHARSKY KAMENIEV--HURRYING ALONG IN THE CENTRE OF A GROUP ALL TALKING AT ONCE WITH HARASSED ANXIOUS FACES AND BULGING PORTFOLIOS UNDER THEIR ARMS
THE ARMIES OF THE NORTHERN FRONT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CRUST OF BREAD NOW FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND IN TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE BISCUITS--WHICH ARE BEING DOLED OUT TO THEM FROM RESERVE SUPPLIES UNTIL NOW NEVER TOUCHED
THERE IS NOW ONLY ONE MASTER OF THE RUSSIAN LAND
THE INSURGENTS NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO SAY OPENLY THEIR OPINION TO THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS UPON THE TSAY-EE-KAH ROLLED IN LIKE BREAKERS THE FIERCE POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE DESERTERS FOR DAYS SMOLNY WAS THRONGED WITH ANGRY DELEGATIONS AND COMMITTEES FROM THE FRONT FROM THE VOLGA FROM THE PETROGRAD FACTORIES
SAILORS GRIM-LOOKING
ON THE EVE
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD BY JOHN REED
AN HOUR LATER THE YUNKERS GOT READY TO MARCH BUT WERE DRIVEN BACK BY A VIOLENT FUSILLADE FROM THE CORNER OF THE GREBETSKAYA AND THE BOLSHOY PROSPEKT
PROVOCATORS
AN END MUST BE PUT TO THIS UNWORTHY POLICY OF FALSEHOOD AND DISTRUST OF FAULT-FINDING AND PROVOCATION
IF HE HAD RESIGNED AS HE THREATENED IT WOULD HAVE MEANT A NEW CABINET CRISIS ONLY SIXTEEN WEEKS BEFORE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND THAT WE WANTED TO AVOID BUT DIDN'T IT AMOUNT TO THAT ANYWAY YES BUT HOW WERE WE TO KNOW
THE SOLDIER DEPUTIES AND THE USSURI COSSACKS DECIDED TO ARREST KERENSKY BUT THE DON COSSACKS PREVENTED THEM AND GOT HIM AWAY BY TRAIN
WE'VE WON HIS SHARP BEARDED FACE GLOWED WITH AN ALMOST RELIGIOUS EXALTATION
VOLLEYS SINGLE SHOTS AND THE SHRILL CHATTER OF MACHINE-GUNS COULD BE HEARD FAR AND NEAR
AT HALF-PAST ELEVEN THREE FIELD-PIECES ARRIVED
EXCEPT FOR THAT THE VAST SPACES OF THE OLD PALACE WERE SILENT AS THE GRAVE
AMID A HURRICANE OF APPLAUSE AND ANGRY CRIES THE SPEAKER DECLARED THAT THIS GATHERING WAS MERELY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE
APPEAL OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET APPEAL OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET TO THE COSACKS TO CALL OFF THEIR KRESTNY KHOD_--THE RELIGIOUS PROCESSION PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER 4TH OUR CALENDAR BROTHERS--COSSACKS IT BEGINS
HOWEVER POPULAR FEELING RAN SO HIGH THAT FOR THE MOMENT HE DID NOT DARE OPPOSE IT AND A TEMPORARY DIRECTORATE OF FIVE OF THE OLD MINISTERS WITH KERENSKY AT THE HEAD ASSUMED THE POWER UNTIL THE QUESTION SHOULD BE SETTLED
VOICES REACHED US ACROSS THE IMMENSE PLACE AND THE SOUND OF PICKS AND SHOVELS
FAINTLY AND SLOWLY HE STILL BREATHED WITH EVERY BREATH SIGHING MIR BOUDIT
RIAZANOV AND KAMENIEV HAD BOTH OPPOSED THE INSURRECTION AND FELT THE LASH OF LENIN'S TERRIBLE TONGUE
BUT NONE OF US KNEW THAT A SERIES OF SECRET CONFERENCES WERE ALREADY GOING ON BETWEEN THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE BOLSHEVIKI AT SMOLNY
IF THE KORNILOVTSI MAKE AN ATTEMPT WE WOULD SHOW THEM OUR STRENGTH
SALUTING THE CREATION OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE THE PETROGRAD GARRISON PROMISES IT COMPLETE SUPPORT IN ALL ITS ACTIONS TO UNITE MORE CLOSELY THE FRONT AND THE REAR IN THE INTERESTS OF THE REVOLUTION
RUSSIA IS A GREAT POWER
OH--THE WOMEN HE LAUGHED
A LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE STOOD SILENTLY STARING AT THEM
GROUP OF PUBLIC MEN AFTER THE CADETS HAD BECOME UNPOPULAR THROUGH THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE KORNILOV COUNTER-REVOLUTION THE GROUP OF PUBLIC MEN WAS FORMED IN MOSCOW
WHEN THE COSSACKS HAD RETREATED AND THE FIRST RED GUARDS ENTERED THE TOWN WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE PRIESTS HAD INCITED THE PEOPLE AGAINST THE SOVIETS AND HAD SAID PRAYERS AT THE GRAVE OF RASPUTIN WHICH LIES BEHIND THE IMPERIAL PALACE
OUT ON THE SQUARE ALL THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO RUN FALLING FLAT ON THEIR FACES AND THE IZVOSHTCHIKI STANDING ON THE CORNERS GALLOPED IN EVERY DIRECTION
THERE WAS A BATTLE THIS MORNING AND THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TO-MORROW MORNING
COMRADES ORGANISE PARENTS COMMITTEES AND PASS RESOLUTIONS AGAINST THE STRIKE OF THE TEACHERS
SOLDIERS WERE STANDING IN EVERY DOORWAY TALKING IN LOW TONES AND PEERING DOWN TOWARD THE POLICE BRIDGE
I SHOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE OFFICERS IN THE ARMY ARE NOT BOLSHEVIKI BUT LIKE ME THEY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY
IT WILL ASSURE THE FREE TRANSFER OF LANDLORD CROWN AND MONASTERY LANDS TO THE LAND COMMITTEES DEFEND THE SOLDIERS RIGHTS ENFORCING A COMPLETE DEMOCRATISATION OF THE ARMY ESTABLISH WORKERS CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION ENSURE THE CONVOCATION OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AT THE PROPER DATE TAKE MEANS TO SUPPLY BREAD TO THE CITIES AND ARTICLES OF FIRST NECESSITY TO THE VILLAGES AND SECURE TO ALL NATIONALITIES LIVING IN RUSSIA A REAL RIGHT TO INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE

A LITTLE GROUP OF INTELLECTUALS WITH A VERY SMALL FOLLOWING AMONG THE WORKING-CLASS EXCEPT THE PERSONAL FOLLOWING OF MAXIM GORKY ITS LEADER
YOU HE CRIED
WE HAD DINNER--AN EXCELLENT DINNER BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN COULD BE GOT IN PETROGRAD--IN THE STATION RESTAURANT
UNSHAVEN AND FILTHY HE WAS REELING FROM THREE NIGHTS SLEEPLESS WORK ON THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
WE COULD NOT BEAT HIM DOWN BELOW FIFTY
THEY RECOGNISE THE POWER OF THE SOVIETS THE NECESSITY OF IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF LAND TO THE PEASANTS AND INDUSTRIAL CONTROL TO THE WORKERS
THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION DIEN OCTOBER 30 MENSHEVIK IS THIS REALLY THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PAMPHLETS WERE DISTRIBUTED BY THOUSANDS OF ORGANISATIONS AND POURED INTO THE ARMIES THE VILLAGES THE FACTORIES THE STREETS
YOU HAVE NOT DINED
THEN THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH STEPPED DOWN AND IN THEIR PLACES APPEARED TROTZKY KAMENIEV LUNATCHARSKY MADAME KOLLENTAI NOGIN
ALL ATTEMPTS TO FIND OUT THE NAME OF THE RUSSIAN ARTILLERY BRIGADE WHICH HAD FIRED ON THEM WERE FUTILE
DOWN WITH HIM MARTOV CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED

INTERVIEW WITH KERENSKY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS MAN TRIED HIS HAND
BILL SHATOV AND PETERS WERE ON DUTY
AT ALL THESE DOORS HAS IT KNOCKED
THE FIRST VOPROS QUESTION BEFORE THE CONGRESS IS THE QUESTION OF POWER AND THIS QUESTION IS ALREADY BEING SETTLED BY FORCE OF ARMS IN THE STREETS
UNTIL THE DECLARATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT--IF ONE IS FORMED--EVERY ONE OUGHT TO REMAIN AT HIS POST AND FULFIL HIS DUTY TOWARD BLEEDING RUSSIA
A LARGE EDUCATIONAL BUDGET IS THE PRIDE AND GLORY OF A NATION
THEY THE GOVERNMENT ARE PREPARING A COUNTER-REVOLUTION
PATROLS OF COSSACKS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE STREETS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE JULY DAYS
HAVING AT ONE BOUND LEAPED FROM THE MIDDLE AGES INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY RUSSIA SHOWED THE STARTLED WORLD TWO SYSTEMS OF REVOLUTION--THE POLITICAL AND THE SOCIAL--IN MORTAL COMBAT
KAMENIEV REMARKED THAT THE ANTI-BOLSHEVIK FORCES WERE TRYING TO STIR UP DISORDERS EVERYWHERE AND READ AN APPEAL OF THE CONGRESS TO ALL THE SOVIETS OF RUSSIA
THE MUNICIPAL DUMA INFORMS THE CITIZENS THAT IN THE EXTRAORDINARY MEETING OF NOVEMBER 6TH THE DUMA FORMED A COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL AND WARD DUMAS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FOLLOWING REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATIONS
THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS RESPONDED BY A SAVAGE TREMOR OF RAGE WHICH SWEPT ALL RUSSIA
THE PROPERTY-OWNING CLASSES WERE BECOMING MORE CONSERVATIVE THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE MORE RADICAL
IT RAINED DULLY DOWN UPON THE COFFINS WITH A THUDDING SOUND AUDIBLE BENEATH THE SINGING
NO MORE COUNCIL I SAYS
STILL KERENSKY DID NOT COME
DESERTERS ARE SCOUNDRELS WHO RUN AWAY HOME AND LEAVE THEIR COMRADES TO DIE IN THE TRENCHES ALONE
WE MUST ASK THE COMMANDANT OH THE COMMANDANT SNEERED THE SAILOR
FOR SOME OF OUR TERMS WE SHALL FIGHT TO THE END--BUT POSSIBLY FOR OTHERS WILL FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE THE WAR
MONDAY MORNING THE 5TH I DROPPED IN AT THE MARINSKY PALACE TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
SOLEMN PUBLIC RESOLUTIONS AGAINST THE CONGRESS DECLARATIONS THAT THE DEMOCRACY WAS OPPOSED TO THE MEETING SO NEAR THE DATE OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FRONT FROM THE UNION OF ZEMSTVOS THE PEASANTS UNION UNION OF COSSACK ARMIES UNION OF OFFICERS KNIGHTS OF ST GEORGE DEATH BATTALIONS,[8 PROTESTING
IMMEDIATE PROPOSAL OF A DEMOCRATIC PEACE ABOLITION OF LANDLORD PROPERTY-RIGHTS OVER THE LAND LABOR CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION CREATION OF A SOVIET GOVERNMENT--THAT CAUSE IS SECURELY ACHIEVED
FOR THE CONTROL OF THE OPERATIONS OF BRANCHES OF THE SAVINGS BANKS AND BANKS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS DECREE THE DISTRICT MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES SHALL ELECT THREE REPRESENTATIVES AND APPOINT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS
IN THE RUSSIAN HOUSEHOLD WHERE I LIVED THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION AT THE DINNER TABLE WAS ALMOST INVARIABLY THE COMING OF THE GERMANS BRINGING LAW AND ORDER
FIVE THOUSAND STEVEDORES AT THE PUTILOV WHARVES GREET THE NEW GOVERNMENT
OUR AIRMEN WOULD SPREAD THESE PROCLAMATIONS ALL OVER GERMANY
THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY WHICH YOU HAVE OVERTHROWN AT THE END THERE WAS APPLAUSE
THEY AGREED TO RETURN AND TCHERNOV ENTERED THE HALL WELCOMED WITH GREAT APPLAUSE BY THE MAJORITY AND THE HOOTS AND JEERS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
GRAPHIC PAGE 281
THE ARTILLERY FIRE ON THE 12TH OF NOVEMBER DEVELOPED WITH EXTRAORDINARY FORCE BY 3 P.M
HE GREETED ME LIKE A LONG-LOST BROTHER
THE SENTRIES IN THE SQUARE HAD ALL DISAPPEARED
WHEN WE SPOKE OF GIVING THE LAND TO THE PEASANTS YOU WERE AGAINST IT
DECLARE KALEDIN KORNILOV DUTOV KARAULOV AND ALL THEIR AIDERS AND ABETTORS TO BE THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE TRAITORS AND BETRAYERS
IT WAS ACCEPTED
JOIN THE WHOLE PEOPLE AGAINST ITS ENEMIES
SEVEN MEMBERS WERE AT ONCE APPOINTED TO CONTINUE THE PROPAGANDA
THERE STRETCHED THE ROWS OF BOLSHEVIK SEATS--EMPTY SINCE THAT FIRST DAY WHEN THEY LEFT THE COUNCIL CARRYING WITH THEM SO MUCH LIFE
COULD I GO WITH HIM
THE DECISIVE MOMENT APPROACHES
THE GREAT HALL WAS JAMMED WITH PEOPLE AND SHAKEN WITH CONTINUAL CLAMOUR
A PROPOSAL WHICH THE AUTHORISED GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC ADDRESSES AT THE SAME TIME TO ALL THE BELLIGERENT PEOPLES AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS
NOTIFIED BY ZALKIND I WAITED IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DOOR
SHOPS WERE OPEN AND THERE SEEMED EVEN LESS UNEASINESS AMONG THE STREET CROWDS THAN THERE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE
PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR OF THE INTERIOR A
PEOPLE'S COMMISSAR OF THE INTERIOR A
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT HERE COMRADE ASKED ANTONOV
WHAT FEW CADET ORGANS APPEARED AND THE BOURGEOISIE GENERALLY ADOPTED A DETACHED IRONICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WHOLE BUSINESS A SORT OF CONTEMPTUOUS I--TOLD--YOU--SO TO THE OTHER PARTIES
AND WE ARE NOT SURE THAT WE WANT A REPUBLIC IN RUSSIA OCTOBER 23D
UNIMPRESSIVE TO BE THE IDOL OF A MOB LOVED AND REVERED AS PERHAPS FEW LEADERS IN HISTORY HAVE BEEN
SO ALL THE LONG NIGHT VOLUNTEERS OF THE PEOPLE RELIEVED EACH OTHER NEVER HALTING IN THEIR DRIVING SPEED AND THE COLD LIGHT OF THE DAWN LAID BARE THE GREAT SQUARE WHITE WITH SNOW AND THE YAWNING BROWN PITS OF THE BROTHERHOOD GRAVE QUITE FINISHED
SHE KNOWS SHE CANNOT WIN
ONLY FIVE THOUSAND REGULAR SOLDIERS HAD JOINED THEM
THE COUNCIL HE SAID DID NOT CONSIDER ITSELF DISSOLVED AT ALL BUT MERELY UNABLE TO CONTINUE ITS LABOURS UNTIL IT SECURED A NEW MEETING-PLACE
KAMENIEV RECOGNISED A DELEGATE FROM THE UNION OF RAILWAY WORKERS A HARDFACED STOCKY MAN WITH AN ATTITUDE OF IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY
EXECUTING THE WILL OF THESE CONGRESSES THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HAS RESOLVED TO ESTABLISH AS A BASIS FOR ITS ACTIVITY IN THE QUESTION OF NATIONALITIES THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES
THESE GROUPS WERE ALSO ATTACKED BY THE PROPERTIED CLASSES BUT THEIR POWER OF RESISTANCE WAS CRIPPLED BY THEIR THEORIES
IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE CENTRAL DUMA OF PETROGRAD ELECTED SEPTEMBER 2D
BUT LENIN HAS ISSUED AN ORDER TO DYNAMITE THE STATE BANK VAULTS AND THERE IS A DECREE JUST OUT ORDERING THE PRIVATE BANKS TO OPEN TO-MORROW OR WE WILL OPEN THEM OURSELVES THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS IN FULL SWING THRONGED WITH ARMED MEN TROTZKY REPORTING
NOW THAT WE'VE WON THE POWER AND ARE SWEEPING ALL RUSSIA HE DECLARED ALL THEY ASK OF US ARE THREE LITTLE THINGS
1 DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA SEE APP
ARREST EVERYBODY COMING AND GOING HE SAYS
WE CANNOT TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH A POLICY AND WE RENOUNCE BEFORE THE TSAY-EE-KAH OUR FUNCTION AS PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF A COSSACK WERE ALWAYS BONDAGE AND PENAL SERVITUDE
WHY SHOULD THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONISTS BE TREATED SO WELL WE ARE REVOLUTIONISTS COMRADES NOT BANDITS ANSWERED THE COMMANDANT
ALL THE OTHER SCHOOLS SURRENDERED WITHOUT RESISTANCE AND THE YUNKERS WERE SENT UNHARMED TO PETER-PAUL AND CRONSTADT
THE MUD UNDERFOOT WAS DEEP SLIPPERY AND CLINGING TRACKED EVERYWHERE BY HEAVY BOOTS AND WORSE THAN USUAL BECAUSE OF THE COMPLETE BREAK-DOWN OF THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION
IN SPITE OF THE SECEDING DELEGATES THE HALL OF MEETINGS WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE ROARING LIKE THE SEA
THEY MIGHT BE OUT THREE OR FOUR DAYS IN A COUNTRY INDIFFERENTLY WELL PROVISIONED
THIS ANGERED THE SOLDIERS
LIKE THE OLD TSAY-EE-KAH IN THE MATTER OF THE SECOND CONGRESS OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS SOVIETS THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE TRIED TO PREVENT THE PEASANT CONGRESS SUMMONED BY SMOLNY
MORE THAN THAT IT WAS COMPELLED FORMALLY TO RECOGNISE THE COUNCIL OF THE UNION OF COSSACK ARMIES AND TO DECLARE ILLEGAL THE NEWLY-FORMED COSSACK SECTION OF THE SOVIETS
AND THOSE REGIMENTS WHICH DID START HALTED ON THE WAY
THE WINDOWS WERE DARK THE DOOR LOCKED
WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE BRUNNOVIKI CONTROLLED THE CITY
FROM THE TSARSKOYE SELO STATION A RADIO-TELEGRAM WAS SENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE FRONT AND TO ALL LOCAL SOVIETS THROUGHOUT RUSSIA
6 THOSE WHO DISOBEY THIS DECREE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO INTENTIONALLY HARM OR DESTROY THE PROPERTY OF THE MUNICIPALITY SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNALS
THE SPIRIT OF OUR TROOPS IS EXCELLENT
TIRED BLOODY TRIUMPHANT THE SAILORS AND WORKERS SWARMED INTO THE SWITCHBOARD ROOM AND FINDING SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS FELL BACK IN AN EMBARRASSED WAY AND FUMBLED WITH AWKWARD FEET
OCCASIONALLY WE MET SQUADS OF SOLDIERS WHO STOPPED AND SURROUNDED ME WITH LOOKS OF MENACE HANDLING MY PASS AROUND AND ARGUING VIOLENTLY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE KILLED
THE MEETING TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE GAUNT BRICK WALLS OF A HUGE UNFINISHED BUILDING TEN THOUSAND BLACK-CLOTHED MEN AND WOMEN PACKED AROUND A SCAFFOLDING DRAPED IN RED PEOPLE HEAPED ON PILES OF LUMBER AND BRICKS PERCHED HIGH UPON SHADOWY GIRDERS INTENT AND THUNDER-VOICED
THE SOCIALIST LEADERS UPON ENTERING THE MINISTRIES INVARIABLY PROVE MERE FIGURE-HEADS PUPPETS SIMPLY A SHIELD FOR THE CAPITALISTS A TOOL WITH WHICH TO DEFRAUD THE WORKERS
THE GARRISON CONFERENCE ELECTED A CONTROL COMMISSION OF FIVE SOLDIERS THUS SECURING A COMPLETE UNITY BETWEEN THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THE GARRISON
THE DUMA BUILDING WAS CROWDED
HE SPOKE IN A RINGING VOICE AND THE GREAT CROWD ROSE TO HIM
BUT SUDDENLY A NEW SOUND MADE ITSELF HEARD DEEPER THAN THE TUMULT OF THE CROWD PERSISTENT DISQUIETING,--THE DULL SHOCK OF GUNS
EVEN THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THROUGH GOTZ
THAT IS WHY WE BEGAN OUR REVOLT WITH ONLY TWO REGIMENTS OF SOLDIERS PROMISING TO SUPPORT US--AND THEY TURNED AGAINST US
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE REFUSES ABSOLUTELY TO SUPPORT THE BOLSHEVIKI IF THEY PERSIST IN ISOLATING THEMSELVES FROM THE WHOLE DEMOCRACY OF RUSSIA IMMENSE TUMULT ALL OVER THE HALL
GREAT RUSSIA BELONGS TO YOU
OF COURSE AS WAS NATURAL THE MANUFACTURERS LAND-OWNERS AND ARMY OFFICERS EXERTED ALL THEIR INFLUENCE AGAINST ANY DEMOCRATIC COMPROMISE
WHATEVER THE OFFICIAL ATTITUDE OF THE ALLIED EMBASSIES INDIVIDUAL FRENCH AND BRITISH OFFICERS WERE ACTIVE THESE DAYS EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING ADVICE AT EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
AT THE GARRISON CONFERENCE IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED TO BEGIN DECISIVE ACTION
I THOUGHT YOU BAGGED ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN LAST NIGHT SAID I POINTING TO THEM
THE OFFICERS WILL NOT WORK WITH OUR COMMITTEES THEY BETRAY US TO THE ENEMY THEY APPLY THE DEATH PENALTY TO OUR AGITATORS
THE CADET BOURGEOISIE IS SUPPLYING THEM WITH ITS MILLIONS
AS EACH MAN APPEARED HE WAS SEIZED BY THE SELF-APPOINTED COMMITTEE WHO WENT THROUGH HIS POCKETS AND LOOKED UNDER HIS COAT
MOREOVER THEY BELONG TO ANOTHER PHASE OF THE HISTORY OF THE SOVIET REPUBLIC WITH WHICH THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING TO DO--THE FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT
I'LL LEAVE TO-NIGHT WHY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ALL THIS HE WAVED HIS ARM AROUND
WE DON'T NEED ANY PASSES
SEPTEMBER 4TH THE ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT RECOMMENCED AND AT 11 O'CLOCK AFTER 36 SHELLS HAD BEEN FIRED THE REBELS RAISED TWO WHITE FLAGS AND BEGAN TO LEAVE THE CAMP WITHOUT ARMS
THOUSANDS KILLED
THE WHOLE TRUTH IS THAT THE BOURGEOISIE WHICH DIRECTS THE POLICIES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS FOR ITS AIM TO BREAK THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY
WHEN WILL PEACE COME
WITH GREAT GLEE IT WAS REPORTED HOW URITZKY HAD GONE TO THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO DEMAND THE SECRET TREATIES AND HOW NERATOV HAD PUT HIM OUT
ANTONOV UNSHAVEN HIS COLLAR FILTHY DRUNK WITH LOSS OF SLEEP
THE DELEGATES OF THE CITY DUMA WITHDREW
LOOK AT THIS HE HELD OUT A SHEET OF PAPER SCRIBBLED HURRIEDLY IN PENCIL AND THEN SEEING WE COULDN'T READ IT HE DECLAIMED ALOUD
I HEARD AFTERWARD THAT HE WAS SHOT
THE POWER SHOULD BE A SOCIALIST AND REVOLUTIONARY POWER RESPONSIBLE BEFORE THE AUTHORISED ORGANS OF THE ENTIRE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY
2 THAT SAME DAY THE WHITE GUARDS AND YUNKERS IN THE KREMLIN SURRENDERED AND WERE ALLOWED TO MARCH OUT UNHARMED
THE SOVIETS OF PEASANTS DEPUTIES DID NOT JOIN THE OTHER TWO UNTIL AFTER THE BOLSHEVIK COUP D'ETAT THEY TOO WERE ORGANISED LIKE THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS WITH AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN PEASANTS SOVIETS IN THE CAPITAL
WHO IS BREAKING UP OUR MEETING THEY SHOUTED
THE PLACE WAS ALL A HUGE BARRACK AND EVIDENTLY HAD BEEN FOR WEEKS FROM THE LOOK OF THE FLOOR AND WALLS
IN ALL THE BARRACKS MEETINGS EVERY NIGHT AND ALL DAY LONG INTERMINABLE HOT ARGUMENTS
THEN UP LEAPED VOLODARSKY SHOUTING HARSHLY THAT THE TSAY-EE-KAH ON THE EVE OF THE CONGRESS HAD NO RIGHT TO ASSUME THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CONGRESS
THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION HAD BEEN OUTLAWED
THE FRONT GROUP WILL LEAVE THE CONGRESS
YOU ARE NOT BOLSHEVIKI I ASKED MOROVSKY
DYBENKO
I AM A REVOLUTIONIST ANSWERED PLEKHANOV WHO FOR FORTY YEARS HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO THE STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY ANYWAY SAID A WORKMAN YOU HAVE NOW SOLD YOURSELF TO THE BOURGEOISIE THE WORKERS NO LONGER KNEW PLEKHANOV PIONEER OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
THE SOCIALIST MINISTERS THE HISTORY OF THE EFFORTS OF THE SOCIALISTS IN THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF JULY TO REALISE THEIR PROGRAMME IN COALITION WITH THE BOURGEOIS MINISTERS IS AN ILLUMINATING EXAMPLE OF CLASS STRUGGLE IN POLITICS
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER IT IS TRUE THAT DYBENKO IS HERE I DON'T KNOW WHO DYBENKO IS HE IS MY ENEMY
WE WALKED AND WALKED AND WALKED BUT WE COULDN'T FIND IT THEY CLIMBED INTO THE TRUCK AND WE PROCEEDED
SMOLNY WAS PLAINLY POWERLESS
IN ONE OF THEIR MEETINGS THE SOLDIERS ISSUED AN APPEAL TO REFUSE TO DRILL SINCE THEY HAD DECIDED TO FIGHT NO MORE
IN THE LEAFLESS BRANCHES OF THE TREES ABOVE THE GRAVE THE WREATHS WERE HUNG LIKE STRANGE MULTI-COLOURED BLOSSOMS
FROM THE TOP OF A LITTLE HILL OUTSIDE THE TOWN COULD BE SEEN THE GOLDEN SPIRES AND MANY-COLOURED CUPOLAS THE SPRAWLING GREY IMMENSITY OF THE CAPITAL SPREAD ALONG THE DREARY PLAIN AND BEYOND THE STEELY GULF OF FINLAND
HOWEVER IT WAS THE COOPERATIVES WHICH FED RUSSIA WHEN THE OLD STRUCTURE OF COMMERCE AND TRANSPORTATION COLLAPSED
KERENSKY OPENED THE OFFICERS SCHOOLS TO THE RANKS TO ANY SOLDIER WHO COULD PASS AN EXAMINATION
THE INTERNATIONALISTS ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE TRANSMISSION OF POWER TO THE DEMOCRACY BUT THEY DISAPPROVE OF THE METHODS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI
THE MARSEILLAIS ARE COMING FOR AT CRONSTADT WERE TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND SAILORS CONVINCED BOLSHEVIKI AND NOT AFRAID TO DIE
YOU SPEAK FOR THE STAFF--NOT FOR THE ARMY I APPEAL TO ALL REASONABLE SOLDIERS TO LEAVE THIS CONGRESS KORNILOVITZ
KARAKHAN MEMBER OF THE BOLSHEVIK CENTRAL COMMITTEE SIMPLY GRINNED
THE SERVANTS ONE USED TO TREAT LIKE ANIMALS AND PAY NEXT TO NOTHING WERE GETTING INDEPENDENT
ANOTHER DEMAND TO SURRENDER WAS MET BY THE YUNKERS SHOOTING DOWN TWO OF THE SOVIET DELEGATES UNDER THE WHITE FLAG
KEEPING GUARD OVER THE WEALTH OF THE PEOPLE THE MASTER OF WHICH CAN BE ONLY THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY REPRESENTING THE WHOLE NATION THE EMPLOYEES REFUSE TO GIVE OUT MONEY FOR PURPOSES WHICH ARE UNKNOWN TO THEM
INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER ESPECIALLY THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHICH WAS ALLOWED TO CIRCULATE FREELY THROUGH THE WINTER PALACE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER ITS CAPTURE MADE AWAY WITH TABLE SILVER CLOCKS BEDDING MIRRORS AND SOME ODD VASES OF VALUABLE PORCELAIN AND SEMI-PRECIOUS STONE TO THE VALUE OF ABOUT $50,000
OUTSIDE THE HALL I RAN INTO THE CITY ENGINEER THE MENSHEVIK GOMBERG AND THREE OR FOUR REPORTERS
A PARLIAMENTARIAN CAME FROM THEM TO THE STAFF OF THE DETACHMENT AT KRASNOYE SELO AND PROPOSED TO STOP THE FIRING THREATENING OTHERWISE TO TAKE DECISIVE MEASURES
UPSTAIRS WAS ANOTHER EATING-PLACE RESERVED FOR THE TSAY-EE-KAH THOUGH EVERY ONE WENT THERE
DESPERATE FIGHTING HAD BROKEN OUT AGAIN IN MOSCOW
IN THIS QUESTION THE PROBLEMS OF FOREIGN POLICY ARE ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO INTERIOR POLITICS FOR IF THERE EXISTED A STRONG SENTIMENT OF UNITY OF ALL GREAT RUSSIA ONE WOULD NOT WITNESS THE REPEATED MANIFESTATIONS EVERYWHERE OF A DESIRE OF PEOPLES TO SEPARATE FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
A BIG PEASANT HIS BEARDED FACE CONVULSED WITH RAGE MOUNTED THE PLATFORM AND POUNDED WITH HIS FIST ON THE PRESIDIUM TABLE
I KNOW OF CERTAIN COAL-MINES NEAR KHARKOV WHICH WERE FIRED AND FLOODED BY THEIR OWNERS OF TEXTILE FACTORIES AT MOSCOW WHOSE ENGINEERS PUT THE MACHINERY OUT OF ORDER WHEN THEY LEFT OF RAILROAD OFFICIALS CAUGHT BY THE WORKERS IN THE ACT OF CRIPPLING LOCOMOTIVES
ONLY WORKERS CONTROL OVER CAPITALIST ENTERPRISES CULTIVATING THE WORKERS CONSCIOUS ATTITUDE TOWARD WORK AND MAKING CLEAR ITS SOCIAL MEANING CAN CREATE CONDITIONS FAVOURABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FIRM SELF-DISCIPLINE IN LABOUR AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL LABOUR'S POSSIBLE PRODUCTIVITY
SAVE THE PEOPLE'S PROPERTY FROM ROBBERY AND US FROM VIOLENCE AND WE SHALL IMMEDIATELY RESUME WORK
IT WAS DARK FROM THREE IN THE AFTERNOON TO TEN IN THE MORNING
BUT THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF THE AIMS AND COMPOSITION OF POLITICAL PARTIES IS LIMITED TO THE GROUPS AND FACTIONS MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK
THE SHELL STRUCK VERA SLUTSKAYA AND KILLED HER AND SO WE CAME INTO TSARSKOYE ALL BUSTLING WITH THE SWAGGERING HEROES OF THE PROLETARIAN HORDE
DAY AFTER TO-MORROW WE SHALL PASS TO THE OFFENSIVE
THE REVOLUTION WHICH IS NOW BEING ACCOMPLISHED WENT ON AVANESSOV HAS NOT HESITATED TO ATTACK PRIVATE PROPERTY
THE CHURCH OF VASILI BLAZHEINY LOOMED FANTASTIC ITS BRIGHT-COLOURED CONVOLUTED AND BLAZONED CUPOLAS VAGUE IN THE DARKNESS
THE LIQUOR PROBLEM ORDER ISSUED BY THE MILITARY REVOLUTONARY COMMITTEE 1
THE CONFISCATION OF SUCH MACHINERY OR LIVE-STOCK SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE SMALL PROPERTIES OF PEASANTS
RUSSIA ENTERED THE WAR FIRST OF ALL THE ALLIES AND FOR A LONG TIME SHE BORE THE WHOLE BRUNT OF IT
AT HELSINGFORS THE FINNISH SENATE DECLINED TO LOAN MONEY TO THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT DECLARED FINLAND AUTONOMOUS AND DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN TROOPS
ON THE OTHER HAND NOVEMBER 8TH WILL BE TOO LATE
THE GALLERIES WERE THRONGED WITH WORKERS--WHO IN RUSSIA STILL REMEMBER THEIR PEASANT ORIGIN
TRANSLATION MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF W
5 SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO TO BE RESTORED AND AIDED BY AN INTERNATIONAL RELIEF FUND
THE COLUMNS OF THE MORNING PAPERS WERE FILLED WITH ACCOUNTS OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS ROBBERIES AND MURDERS AND THE CRIMINALS WERE UNMOLESTED
A DOZEN MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY SET OUT TO DISTRIBUTE AMONG THEM ARMFULS OF THE LATEST PROCLAMATION OF THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION
ALL THEIR DECISIONS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED BY THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISSOLVE THE COMMITTEES AT ANY TIME
WE HAVE NO FOLLOWING--NOW
THEY HURLED THE MILIUKOV MINISTRY DOWN
ALL PERSONS GUILTY OF SUCH ACTIONS SHALL BE SUBJECT BY SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE TO IMMEDIATE ARREST AND CONFINEMENT IN THE PRISONS OF CRONSTADT PENDING THEIR ARRAIGNMENT BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL

AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE STATE IS IN DANGER BECAUSE OF CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS TREASON THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND MYSELF AMONG OTHERS PREFER TO BE KILLED RATHER THAN BETRAY THE LIFE THE HONOUR AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF RUSSIA AT THIS MOMENT A PAPER WAS HANDED TO KERENSKY
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR THEIR PRINCIPAL SUPPORT IS THE
ON THE MORNING OF THE 6TH I HAD BUSINESS WITH THE CENSOR WHOSE OFFICE WAS IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
FROM THE PETROGRAD MUNICIPAL DUMA

WHILE THE PEASANTS HAD BEEN POLITICALLY BACKWARD STILL THEY HAD THEIR OWN PECULIAR IDEAS AND THEY CONSTITUTED MORE THAN EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
THE FIRST TIME THE CITY DUMA MEMBERS AND THE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY LEADERS WERE PRESENT IN IMPOSING NUMBERS AND SPOKE SO GRAVELY OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE COMMISSAR WAS FRIGHTENED
WE ARE AWAITING YOU HERE GENERAL AND AT THE MOMENT OF YOUR ARRIVAL WE SHALL ADVANCE WITH ALL THE FORCES AT OUR DISPOSAL
MESHKOVSKY A NEAT FRAIL LITTLE MAN WAS COMING DOWN THE HALL LOOKING WORRIED
AND BY EXECUTIVE ORDER THE WINE-CELLARS WERE INVADED BY COMMITTEES WITH HATCHETS WHO SMASHED THE BOTTLES--OR BLEW THEM UP WITH DYNAMITE
AT THE ALEXANDRINSKY THEY WERE REVIVING MEYERHOLD'S PRODUCTION OF TOLSTOY'S DEATH OF IVAN THE TERRIBLE
THE FRESCOES ON THE PORCH OF BLAGOVESTCHENSKY CATHEDRAL WERE BADLY DAMAGED BY A SHELL
WE CONTROL THE BATTALION ABSOLUTELY EXCEPT IN ACTION WHEN THE COLONEL IS DELEGATED BY US TO COMMAND
NOW A LARGE PART OF THEM WERE BOLSHEVIKI
GIRL AFTER GIRL CAME TO THE TRIBUNE--OVER-DRESSED FASHION-APING LITTLE GIRLS WITH PINCHED FACES AND LEAKY SHOES
THE COMPROMISERS SAY THAT WE ARE ISOLATED

I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM GRONSKY IN THE NAME OF THE POLISH SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
NIGHT CAME SWIFTLY DOWN THE WIDE-SPACED STREET-LIGHTS FLICKERED ON THE TIDES OF PEOPLE FLOWED ENDLESSLY
THE OWNERSHIP OF PRINT-TYPE AND OF PAPER BELONGS FIRST TO THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND ONLY AFTERWARDS TO THE BOURGEOIS PARTIES WHICH ARE IN A MINORITY
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THIS DATA AND TO PRODUCE THE BOOKS OF THE COMPANY UPON DEMAND OF THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEE
ON THE SIDE OF THE SOVIETS WERE THE RANK AND FILE OF THE WORKERS THE SAILORS ALL THE UNDEMORALISED SOLDIERS THE LANDLESS PEASANTS AND A FEW--A VERY FEW--INTELLECTUALS
SUPPOSE SOME COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES CAME ALONG IN A TRUCK AND SAID
I HAVE ORDERS REPEATED THE SAILOR SULLENLY
THE CITY HAD AGAIN SETTLED DOWN TO NORMAL--SHOP-SHUTTERS UP LIGHTS SHINING AND ON THE STREETS GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE SLOWLY MOVING UP AND DOWN AND ARGUING
FINALLY THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE SENT OUT COMPANIES OF SAILORS WITH MACHINE-GUNS WHO FIRED MERCILESSLY UPON THE RIOTERS KILLING MANY
DEPUTIES PETROGRAD NOV
THESE WERE RUDE BOXES MADE OF UNPLANED WOOD AND DAUBED WITH CRIMSON BORNE HIGH ON THE SHOULDERS OF ROUGH MEN WHO MARCHED WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN THEIR FACES AND FOLLOWED BY WOMEN WHO SOBBED AND SCREAMED OR WALKED STIFFLY WITH WHITE DEAD FACES
FOR PEACE BREAD LAND AND POPULAR GOVERNMENT TO ALL FRONT AND REAR ARMY CORPS DIVISIONAL REGIMENTAL AND COMPANY COMMITTEES AND ALL SOVIETS OF WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS DEPUTIES
OBSHTCHEE DIELO WAS SUPPRESSED
IN THE NICOLAI HALL THE DUMA SESSION WAS COMING TO AN END
SOME ONE THERE CAN SURELY READ THEY HESITATED
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ELECTED BY THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND AN HONOURABLE DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION
AS A CONSEQUENCE THEY INSISTED UPON THE COLLABORATION OF THE PROPERTIED CLASSES IN THE GOVERNMENT
THE DISORDERS CAUSED BY THE INSANE ATTEMPT OF THE BOLSHEVIKI PLACE THE COUNTRY ON THE VERGE OF A PRECIPICE AND DEMAND THE EFFORT OF OUR ENTIRE WILL OUR COURAGE AND THE DEVOTION OF EVERY ONE OF US TO WIN THROUGH THE TERRIBLE TRIAL WHICH THE FATHERLAND IS UNDERGOING
THEY CONCEALED THEIR PLOT FROM THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES COMPOSING THE SOVIET
ON NOVEMBER 27TH A COMMITTEE OF COSSACKS CAME TO SMOLNY TO SEE TROTZKY AND LENIN
AT THIS MEETING HOWEVER ONLY MEMBERS OF THE TSAY-EE-KAH COULD VOTE
GRAPHIC PAGE 205
IN THE MUNICIPAL BUILDING THE DUMA WAS IN FULL BLAST
KALEDIN IS THE ENEMY OF THE REVOLUTION BUT THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE EQUALLY ENEMIES OF THE REVOLUTION WHICH DO YOU PREFER--KALEDIN OR THE BOLSHEVIKI IT IS NOT A QUESTION TO BE DISCUSSED HE BURST OUT IMPATIENTLY
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WERE ORDERED TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK AND THREATENED WITH SEVERE PENALTIES IF THEY REFUSED
THESE WERE ANTONOV AND DYBENKO
THEY PASSED IN SILENCE
IN THE MEANWHILE BEHIND THE BACK OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE BY TRICKERY BY DEALS BETWEEN CITIZEN KERENSKY THE CADETS AND THE LEADERS OF THE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES WE RECEIVED THE OPPOSITE RESULT FROM THE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED PURPOSE
THE MINISTER-PRESIDENT HAD TAKEN TSARSKOYE SELO WE WERE TOLD AND WAS ALREADY IN THE PETROGRAD CAMPAGNA FIVE MILES AWAY
ECONOMIC TERMS COMMERCIAL TREATIES ARE NOT TO BE A PART OF THE PEACE TERMS
WHERE'S THE FRONT BROTHERS THE FOREMOST SAILOR HALTED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
THE ARMY DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY SOLDIERS BEGAN TO STAND UP ALL OVER THE HALL
THE RESULT DEPENDS UPON PETROGRAD
THE ORDER HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ARREST KERENSKY
HALF A DOZEN RED GUARDS SAILORS AND SOLDIERS WERE SITTING AROUND A HOT ROOM FULL OF SMOKE IN WHICH A SAMOVAR STEAMED CHEERFULLY
WHAT HAVE WE SOLDIERS GOT TO DO WITH THESE SQUABBLES OF POLITICAL PARTIES
KRASNOV'S ANSWER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION IN ANSWER TO YOUR TELEGRAM PROPOSING AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE THE SUPREME COMMANDER NOT WISHING FURTHER FUTILE BLOODSHED CONSENTS TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS AND TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ARMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSURRECTIONISTS
A TALL YOUNG MAN WITH A SUPERCILIOUS EXPRESSION DRESSED IN THE UNIFORM OF A STUDENT WAS LEADING THE ATTACK
IN THE SAME ORNATE WHITE ROOM SOME RED GUARDS WERE RUMMAGING CURIOUSLY AROUND WHILE MY OLD FRIEND THE COLONEL STOOD BY THE WINDOW BITING HIS MOUSTACHE
DESCENDING WE SPREAD OUT AND EVERY MAN CARRYING HIS RIFLE WENT STEALTHILY INTO THE FOREST
I HEARD BUSINESS MEN SPEAK OF IT SO
IT IS A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY SAID HE
SHOW THE BLACK BAND THAT YOU ARE NOT TRAITORS TO THE PEOPLE AND THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE CURSED BY THE WHOLE OF REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING THE VLADIMIR YUNKER SCHOOL WAS VISITED BY A PATROL OF SOLDIERS SAILORS AND RED GUARDS WHO GAVE THE YUNKERS TWENTY MINUTES TO LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS
THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY SENT OUT SOME DOZENS OF AGITATORS WITH THOUSANDS OF PRINTED APPEALS TO INFORM THE COSSACKS OF THE REAL SITUATION
IN IT LENIN SERIOUSLY PRESENTED THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF INSURRECTION TAKING AS TEXT THE OBJECTIONS OF KAMENIEV AND RIAZONOV
JUST AT THE CORNER OF THE EKATERINA CANAL UNDER AN ARC-LIGHT A CORDON OF ARMED SAILORS WAS DRAWN ACROSS THE NEVSKY BLOCKING THE WAY TO A CROWD OF PEOPLE IN COLUMN OF FOURS
AT ONCE EVERY ONE BEGAN ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT AMERICA
WOULD RUSSIA FOLLOW AND RISE
WHO'S GOT A PENCIL NEEDLESS TO SAY TRUSISHKA HAD THE ONLY PENCIL IN THE CROWD
IN THE ROWS OF SEATS UNDER THE WHITE CHANDELIERS PACKED IMMOVABLY IN THE AISLES AND ON THE SIDES PERCHED ON EVERY WINDOW-SILL AND EVEN THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OF ALL RUSSIA WAITED IN ANXIOUS SILENCE OR WILD EXULTATION THE RINGING OF THE CHAIRMAN'S BELL
THEY CAPTURED TWO OR THREE HUNDRED OF OUR MEN AND KILLED ABOUT TWENTY-FIVE WHERE ARE THE COSSACKS WELL THEY DIDN'T GET THIS FAR
WHAT COULD I DO HE MUTTERED
SUPERINTENDING THE UNINTERRUPTED CONTINUATION OF THEIR HOUSES AND TURNING OVER TO THE SOVIETS ALL PRIVATE ADVERTISING AND THE SUMS RECEIVED THEREFOR AS WELL AS ALL ACCOUNTS AND COPY
EVEN THE MILITARY MEN OPPOSED IT
THE GROUP DECLARED ITSELF NON-PARTISAN ALTHOUGH ITS INTELLECTUAL LEADERS WERE MEN LIKE RODZIANKO AND SHULGIN
THE ONLY SALVATION FOR THE WHOLE OF OUR COUNTRY AND FOR THE COSSACKS IN PARTICULAR IS A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE
TCHERNOV WAS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN TRYING TO ORGANISE THE NEUTRAL TROOPS INTO A FORCE TO HALT THE CIVIL WAR
A MONTH LATER SEEING HIS ARMY MELT AWAY BEFORE HIS EYES KALEDIN BLEW OUT HIS BRAINS
NOW BEGAN A REAL BOMBARDMENT
THE GOVERNMENT OF KERENSKY IS NOT A SCREEN BEHIND WHICH CAN BE HIDDEN DIRTY WORK LIKE DESERTION
ULIANOV-LENIN
ON THE CONTRARY THE ENTIRE SCHOOL WORK OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ORGANS OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT
HER LOSSES HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF ALL THE OTHER NATIONS PUT TOGETHER
I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT
HE HAD JUST BEEN ARRESTED
THE YUNKERS NOW HELD THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
THERE WOULD BE TELEPHONE MESSAGES TO THE DIFFERENT BARRACKS ANNOUNCING THAT WINE WAS BEING GIVEN AWAY AT SUCH AND SUCH AN ADDRESS AND WHEN THE SOLDIERS ARRIVED AT THE SPOT AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD POINT OUT THE LOCATION OF THE CELLAR
THERE ARE AT THIS MOMENT IN RUSSIA ONLY TWO PARTIES WITH ANY FORCE--THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE REACTIONARIES WHO ARE ALL HIDING UNDER THE COAT-TAILS OF THE CADETS
14 SEE NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
THE ONLY REASON FOR BOLSHEVIK SUCCESS LAY IN THEIR ACCOMPLISHING THE VAST AND SIMPLE DESIRES OF THE MOST PROFOUND STRATA OF THE PEOPLE CALLING THEM TO THE WORK OF TEARING DOWN AND DESTROYING THE OLD AND AFTERWARD IN THE SMOKE OF FALLING RUINS COOPERATING WITH THEM TO ERECT THE FRAME-WORK OF THE NEW
WE ENTERED THE DINING-ROOM AT A LONG TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH SAT ABOUT TWENTY OFFICERS IN FULL UNIFORM WEARING THEIR GOLD AND SILVER-HANDLED SWORDS THE RIBBONS AND CROSSES OF IMPERIAL DECORATIONS
LIMITATIONS OF THIS CHAPTER THIS CHAPTER EXTENDS OVER A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS MORE OR LESS
SUPPORT KORNILOV WHO INTRODUCED CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR SOLDIERS AND COSSACKS AT THE FRONT
THEY BELIEVED THAT RUSSIA MUST PASS THROUGH THE STAGES OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT KNOWN TO WESTERN EUROPE AND EMERGE AT LAST WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD INTO FULL-FLEDGED SOCIALISM
SERBIA TO HAVE AN OUTLET ON THE ADRIATIC
AND THE COSSACK MOVEMENT WAS NO MORE
AT COLPINNO AT OBUKHOVO AT PULKOVO AND KRASNOYE SELO WERE FORMED PROVISIONAL DETACHMENTS INCREASED IN SIZE AS THE STRAGGLERS CAME IN FROM THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY--MIXED SOLDIERS SAILORS AND RED GUARDS PARTS OF REGIMENTS INFANTRY CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY ALL TOGETHER AND A FEW ARMOURED CARS
THE PRESENT DECREE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE TSAY-EE-KAH AT THE MEETING OF NOVEMBER 23D 1917 AND SIGNED BY
IF THEY HAD NOT SUCCEEDED TO THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY DID THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE ARMIES OF IMPERIAL GERMANY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW IN DECEMBER AND RUSSIA WOULD AGAIN BE RIDDEN BY A TSAR
IN ALL THE OFFICES OF THE HUGE PLACE PERSPIRING VOLUNTEER WORKERS SOLDIERS AND SAILORS THEIR TONGUES STICKING OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS IN THE INTENSITY OF THEIR EFFORT WERE PORING OVER THE GREAT LEDGERS WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
THE PETROGRAD SOVIET ISSUED A MANIFESTO HEADED BROTHERS--COSSACKS YOU COSSACKS ARE BEING INCITED AGAINST US WORKERS AND SOLDIERS
THERE WAS A FEELING AMONG BUSINESS MEN AND THE INTELLIGENTZIA GENERALLY THAT THE REVOLUTION HAD GONE QUITE FAR ENOUGH AND LASTED TOO LONG
FROM THE DUMA THE COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION AND LAST OF ALL FROM THE VIKZHEL THE UNION OF RAILWAY WORKERS INSISTED THAT SOME AGREEMENT BE REACHED TO HALT THE CIVIL WAR AND DEMANDED THAT KERENSKY TREAT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THAT HE STOP THE ADVANCE ON PETROGRAD
ALL ARTICLES OF EXISTING LAWS APPLYING TO THESE MATTERS ARE HEREWITH REPEALED
ON OCTOBER 14TH THE OFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE MODERATE SOCIALISTS SAID
THE BARE GLOOMY AMPHITHEATRE LIT BY FIVE TINY LIGHTS HANGING FROM A THIN WIRE WAS PACKED FROM THE RING UP THE STEEP SWEEP OF GRIMY BENCHES TO THE VERY ROOF--SOLDIERS SAILORS WORKMEN WOMEN ALL LISTENING AS IF THEIR LIVES DEPENDED UPON IT
IN THE UPSTAIRS BUFFET SO THICK THEY LAY THAT ONE COULD HARDLY WALK
MR A
EVERY DESERTER IS A TRAITOR AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED UPROAR SHOUTS OF DO VOLNO
FORCED AGAINST HIS WILL INTO THE BUTCHERY OF THE TRENCHES HE CRIED WHICH YOU YOURSELVES IN THE PEACE DECREE HAVE VOTED SENSELESS AS WELL AS HORRIBLE HE GREETED THE REVOLUTION WITH HOPE OF PEACE AND FREEDOM
ONE SPOKE OF THE COMING WORLD-REVOLUTION OF WHICH WE ARE THE ADVANCE-GUARD
AND THE WAR MUST BE WON BEFORE ANY CHANGE AT THIS HOOTS AND IRONICAL CHEERS
YOUR OWN GENERALS AND LANDOWNERS ARE DECEIVING YOU IN ORDER TO KEEP YOU IN DARKNESS AND SLAVERY
EVEN DIELO NARODA HAS BEEN SCARED INTO YELLING THAT THE LAND MUST BE TURNED OVER TO THE PEASANTS AND NOT ONLY THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES IN THE COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC BUT ALSO THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF HAS BEEN SIMILARLY AFFECTED
STARVATION AND DEFEAT MAY BRING THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE TO THEIR SENSES MR LIANOZOV WAS EMPHATIC IN HIS OPINION THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS TO PERMIT THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORKERS SHOP COMMITTEES OR TO ALLOW THE WORKERS ANY SHARE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY
THE EMPLOYEES HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR AND WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE TOILING PEOPLE PART OF WHICH THEY ARE THEMSELVES AND NOT A SINGLE KOPEK NECESSARY FOR THE FRONT AND THE WORKERS HAS EVER BEEN DETAINED AND WILL NOT BE DETAINED BY THE EMPLOYEES
THEY WILL NOT DARE OR IF THEY DARE THEY WILL SOON BE SENT FLYING
THE ORDER OF THE DAY SAID KAMENIEV WAS FIRST ORGANISATION OF POWER
BUT NOW THAT BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILLED THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY--PITILESS STRUGGLE
THE ORDERS ARE TO ADVANCE WITH ALL SPEED AND PREPARE TO ENGAGE THE COSSACKS NORTH OF GATCHINA IN THE MORNING
THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE LIQUIDATED ESTABLISHMENTS ARE TAKEN OVER BY THE STATE BANK
ON PRINCIPLE AND FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT WE MUST URGENTLY DISCUSS A MEANS OF AVERTING CIVIL WAR
BRINGING THESE FACTS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PETROGRAD POPULATION THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE ORDERS THE ARREST OF ALL CONCERNED IN THE CONSPIRACY WHO SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL
AUTOMOBILES AND MOTORCYCLES CAME AND WENT
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEES OF THE MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY PARTIES THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PEASANT'S SOVIETS RESOLVED THAT ALTHOUGH UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO THE CRIMINAL POLITICS OF THE BOLSHEVIKI THEY WOULD IN ORDER TO HALT THE FRATRICIDAL BLOODSHED NOT OPPOSE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE PEOPLE'S COUNCIL

THE PROBLEM OF A GENUINELY DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATION OF INSTRUCTION IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT IN A COUNTRY IMPOVERISHED BY A LONG CRIMINAL IMPERIALISTIC WAR
THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE EIGHTH ARMY
THE SAME RUNNING MEN IN THE DARK CORRIDORS SQUADS OF WORKERS WITH RIFLES LEADERS WITH BULGING PORTFOLIOS ARGUING EXPLAINING GIVING ORDERS AS THEY HURRIED ANXIOUSLY ALONG SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND LIEUTENANTS
THE AIR WAS FOUL
YOU ARE ASKING WHY THE RUSSIANS HAVE STOPPED FIGHTING AND THE RUSSIANS ARE ASKING WHERE IS THE BRITISH FLEET--WITH GERMAN BATTLE-SHIPS IN THE GULF OF RIGA AGAIN HE CEASED SUDDENLY AND AS SUDDENLY BURST OUT
INVITES ALL PEASANTS UNANIMOUSLY TO SUSTAIN THAT LAW AND TO APPLY IT IMMEDIATELY THEMSELVES
THE STORY OF THE IMMEDIATE PEACE OF THE BOLSHEVIKI REMINDS US OF A JOYOUS MOVING-PICTURE FILM
COLONEL MURAVIOV EX-PATRIOT WAS IN COMMAND--AN EFFICIENT MAN BUT TO BE CAREFULLY WATCHED
WE REMAIN NEUTRAL DURING THIS TALK PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY ENTERING AND LEAVING--MOST OF THEM OFFICERS THEIR SHOULDER-STRAPS TORN OFF
WINE POGROMS IT WAS AFTERWARD DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A REGULAR ORGANISATION MAINTAINED BY THE CADETS FOR PROVOKING RIOTING AMONG THE SOLDIERS

THE ATMOSPHERE WAS THAT OF ANY OFFICERS MESS IN EUROPE
THIS WAS HALTED JUST IN TIME BY THE MARCH REVOLUTION
LOOK OUT COMRADES
HE STARED AT US WITH COLD FIXITY
3 THE ABOLITION OF ANY AND ALL NATIONAL AND NATIONAL RELIGIOUS PRIVILEGES AND DISABILITIES
THERE IS NO USE FOR THE DEMOCRACY TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OR IMPOSSIBILITY OF A WINTER CAMPAIGN
WHEN COMRADE KOLLONTAI WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON BY THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS AVKSENTIEV PLACED AT HER DOOR TWO FORMER AGENTS OF THE TSAR'S SECRET POLICE THE PEASANTS WITHDREW MUTTERING FOLLOWED BY IRONICAL HOOTS
THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI REFUSE TO BE INVOLVED IN WHAT IS HAPPENING AND CALL UPON ALL PUBLIC FORCES TO RESIST THE ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE POWER KUTCHIN DELEGATE OF THE 12TH ARMY AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TROUDOVIKI
WE MUST TAKE YOU TO THE REGIMENTAL COMMITTEE THEY SAID
WE WILL SPANK YOU HE CRIED ENERGETICALLY
NOVEMBER 7TH 1917
ALL STUDS GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE CATTLE-BREEDING AND BIRD-BREEDING ESTABLISHMENTS AND OTHERS ARE CONFISCATED AND BECOME NATIONAL PROPERTY AND ARE TRANSFERRED EITHER TO THE STATE OR TO THE COMMUNITY ACCORDING TO THEIR SIZE AND IMPORTANCE
ON THE PLEA OF EMERGENCY WHICH THE CROWD ALMOST ALWAYS GRANTS ANYBODY FROM THE FLOOR CAN GET UP AND SAY ANYTHING ON ANY SUBJECT
THE PEASANTS UNDERSTOOD THE EXACT MEANING OF THE REVOLUTION--THEY TRIED TO TURN WORDS INTO ACTION
THE MISTAKE OF THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES LIES IN THE FACT THAT AT THAT TIME THEY DID NOT OPPOSE THE POLICY OF COMPROMISE BECAUSE THEY HELD THE THEORY THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MASSES WAS NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED
THEIR DECREES AND THEIR APPEALS WILL SIMPLY ADD TO THE MUSEUM OF HISTORICAL CURIOSITIES
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT RUSSIA BURNS AND FALLS IN RUINS AND THAT THE SMOKE OF THE TERRIBLE CONFLAGRATION MAKES THE EYES OF OUR ALLIES SMART
THE GARRISON AND SQUADRON AT REVAL ELECT MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES TO COOPERATE AND DESPATCH TROOPS
ONE YEAR AGO MY GOVERNMENT INSTRUCTED ME NOT TO RECEIVE MILIUKOV BECAUSE HE WAS SO DANGEROUSLY LEFT SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER ARE THE WORST MONTHS OF THE RUSSIAN YEAR--ESPECIALLY THE PETROGRAD YEAR
NOT EVERYBODY'S IN FAVOUR OF SOME AGREEMENT WITH THE SOIVETS
FEW QUESTIONS FROM ME WERE NECESSARY
BUT IN THIS EXHIBITION OF SOCIALISM ON PAPER--MORE LIKELY DESIGNED FOR THE STUPEFACTION OF OUR DESCENDANTS--THERE APPEARS NEITHER THE DESIRE NOR THE CAPACITY TO SOLVE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS OF THE DAY
IF THE BOLSHEVIKI WANT TO ESTABLISH A SOCIALIST STATE HERE WE CANNOT WORK WITH THEM IN ANY EVENT
A NEW GOVERNMENT MUST BE CREATED RESPONSIBLE TO THE ELEMENTS SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTION
WE HAD A TERRIBLE TIME DECIDING WHAT TO DO WITH THEM--MANY WERE IN HYSTERICS AND SO ON
IF WE ARE BROKEN THEN IT WILL BE IN DEFENDING OUR FLAG KRYLENKO FOLLOWED HIM EXPLAINING THE SITUATION AT THE FRONT WHERE DUKHONIN WAS PREPARING TO RESIST THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS
THE ONLY SIGN OF LIFE WAS SMOKE FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A DATCHYA A RAMBLING WOODEN HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE SIDE ROAD
BY THIS TIME IN THE LIGHT THAT STREAMED OUT OF ALL THE WINTER PALACE WINDOWS I COULD SEE THAT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE HUNDRED MEN WERE RED GUARDS WITH ONLY A FEW SCATTERED SOLDIERS
WHEN THE TROOPS OF THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT ARRIVE IN PETROGRAD THEY WILL SHOOT DOWN THESE INSURGENTS AND THAT WILL NOT BE LYNCHING PROTESTS ALL OVER THE HALL EVEN FROM HIS OWN PARTY
NEWS ALL-IMPORTANT TO RUSSIA MUST BE ON THE PRESS TO-MORROW MORNING
YESTERDAY'S HORRORS ARE BUT A PREFACE TO WHAT YOU ARE PREPARING BY SUCH A PROCLAMATION
IT CRUSHED AN INSURRECTION THE KORNILOV ATTEMPT CONCERNING WHICH EVERY ONE IS NOW ASKING DID IT EVER EXIST 3
THE FUNERAL MARCH SEEMED THE VERY SOUL OF THOSE DARK MASSES WHOSE DELEGATES SAT IN THIS HALL BUILDING FROM THEIR OBSCURE VISIONS A NEW RUSSIA--AND PERHAPS MORE
HERE WERE THE REAL PROLETARIANS OF THE LAND
BUT IF WE SHOULD BE OVERPOWERED WELL EVERY MAN KEEPS ONE BULLET FOR HIMSELF AT THIS POINT THERE WAS A BURST OF RIFLE-FIRE NOT FAR OFF
HE WAS DRAWING CAREFUL PLANS FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CAPITAL
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY SCHEMES OF ALL SORTS ARE NOW BEING HATCHED IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC
TAKE INTO YOUR TOIL-WORN HANDS THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE COSSACKS
THEY SAID MOREOVER THAT THEY HAD THEIR MEN WITH KERENSKY AND THAT THEY WERE DOING THEIR PART
AT THE CENTRE TABLE THE HUGE DYBENKO BENT OVER A MAP MARKING OUT POSITIONS FOR THE TROOPS WITH RED AND BLUE PENCILS
NEWS FROM THE PROVINCES
NEWS FROM THE PROVINCES
IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE POLITICAL FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY HAVE EXISTED SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT OF THE WORKERS--FOR EXAMPLE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE--THE CAPITALISTS MAKE USE OF THIS SUBTERFUGE AND VERY SUCCESSFULLY TOO
FORWARD CAME FROM ALL SIDES
REMEMBER COMRADES THAT TWO OF THESE DESERTERS KAMENIEV AND ZINOVIEV EVEN BEFORE THE UPRISING IN PETROGRAD APPEARED AS DESERTERS AND STRIKE-BREAKERS BY VOTING AT THE DECISIVE MEETING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OCTOBER 23D 1917 AGAINST THE INSURRECTION
THE SECOND TIME HE ARRIVED WITH A WARRANT WHICH HE PROCEEDED TO READ ALOUD IN DUE FORM
KIEV BOLSHEVIKI CAPTURED THE ARSENAL AND THE TELEGRAPH STATION ONLY TO BE DRIVEN OUT BY DELEGATES TO THE CONGRESS OF COSSACKS WHICH HAPPENED TO BE MEETING THERE
THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY CREATED A SPECIAL COMMISSION COMPOSED OF ARTISTS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS TO RECOVER THE STOLEN OBJECTS
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ORDERS YOU CITIZEN COMMANDER
THE SALUTE TO BE REESTABLISHED AND MADE OBLIGATORY
ALREADY SMOLNY HAS SENT DELEGATES INVITING US TO FORM A NEW GOVERNMENT
NOT A CAB IN SIGHT
ALL COMMANDERS HIGHER THAN THE COMMANDER OF A REGIMENT AND UP TO THE SUPREME COMMANDER INCLUSIVE ARE ELECTED BY CONGRESSES OR CONFERENCES OF COMMITTEES
THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS ISSUED A PROCLAMATION TO THE COSSACKS SEE APP
WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS EVERYWHERE YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE WORKERS AND SOLDIERS OF PETROGRAD
IF YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT I AM DEFENDING THE REVOLUTION THEN I'LL GO OUT AND FIGHT WITHOUT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO FORCE ME WHEN THE LAND BELONGS TO THE PEASANTS AND THE FACTORIES TO THE WORKERS AND THE POWER TO THE SOVIETS THEN WE'LL KNOW WE HAVE SOMETHING TO FIGHT FOR AND WE'LL FIGHT FOR IT IN THE BARRACKS THE FACTORIES ON THE STREET-CORNERS END LESS SOLDIER SPEAKERS ALL CLAMOURING FOR AN END TO THE WAR DECLARING THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT MAKE AN ENERGETIC EFFORT TO GET PEACE THE ARMY WOULD LEAVE THE TRENCHES AND GO HOME
SUCH IS THE HONEST DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S PEACE WHICH THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS IS PROPOSING TO ALL GOVERNMENTS TO ALL PEOPLES ALLIES AND ENEMIES
