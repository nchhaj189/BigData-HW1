THEIR SUFFRAGE IS CLAIMED WITH EQUAL CONFIDENCE BY THE ORTHODOX AND BY THE HERETICAL PARTIES
IT WAS DESIGNED BY CONSTANTINE TO ADORN HIS NEW CITY
BUT THE OPERATION OF THE WISEST LAWS IS IMPERFECT AND PRECARIOUS
DIOCLETIAN AND HIS COLLEAGUES FREQUENTLY CONFERRED THE MOST IMPORTANT OFFICES ON THOSE PERSONS WHO AVOWED THEIR ABHORRENCE FOR THE WORSHIP OF THE GODS BUT WHO HAD DISPLAYED ABILITIES PROPER FOR THE SERVICE OF THE STATE
THE REMAINS OF THE OSTROGOTHS WERE PLANTED IN PHRYGIA AND LYDIA
THEY HAD ONLY A PERSONAL RIGHT
BUT AS THE WANTS AND EXPENSES OF THE CHURCH INCREASED WITH HER PROSPERITY THE ECCLESIASTICAL ORDER WAS STILL SUPPORTED AND ENRICHED BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL
THEIR DEITY WAS A TRUE BUT NOT THE ONLY GOD APUL CYRIL

THE PRAEFECTURE OF JUVENTIUS WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH PEACE AND PLENTY BUT THE TRANQUILLITY OF HIS GOVERNMENT WAS SOON DISTURBED BY A BLOODY SEDITION OF THE DISTRACTED PEOPLE
THIS CUSTOM IS OF STILL EARLIER DATE THE ROMANS HAD BORROWED IT FROM GREECE
OF THE LATTER TO CONTRIBUTE THE SHARE OF THEIR PROPERTY WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE STATE
AND IN THE VARIOUS TURNS OF HIS PROSPEROUS AND ADVERSE FORTUNE HE NEVER LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS FRIENDS OR THE ESTEEM OF HIS ENEMIES
BY EMBRACING THE FAITH OF THE GOSPEL THE CHRISTIANS INCURRED THE SUPPOSED GUILT OF AN UNNATURAL AND UNPARDONABLE OFFENCE

AND WHICH IF IT REALLY PREVAILED AMONG THEM IN SO EXTRAVAGANT A DEGREE CANNOT SURELY BE PARALLELED IN ANY COUNTRY OR IN ANY AGE

MANY WERE IMPRISONED AND PERSECUTED AND DRIVEN INTO EXILE

REJECTING WITH DISDAIN THE DELICACIES PROVIDED FOR HIS TABLE HE SATISFIED HIS APPETITE WITH THE COARSE AND COMMON FARE WHICH WAS ALLOTTED TO THE MEANEST SOLDIERS

IF THEY WERE ASKED WHETHER THE SON WAS LIKE UNTO THE FATHER THE QUESTION WAS RESOLUTELY ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE BY THE HERETICS WHO ADHERED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF ARIUS OR INDEED TO THOSE OF PHILOSOPHY

78 BUT THE CHRISTIANS ENTERTAINED A NATURAL AND PIOUS EXPECTATION THAT IN THIS MEMORABLE CONTEST THE HONOR OF RELIGION WOULD BE VINDICATED BY SOME SIGNAL MIRACLE
AND ABYSSINIA STILL REVERES THE MEMORY OF FRUMENTIUS 78A WHO IN THE TIME OF CONSTANTINE DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO THE CONVERSION OF THOSE SEQUESTERED REGIONS

AND STRUGGLING WITHOUT SUCCESS TO DECLARE HIS INTENTIONS TO THE GENERALS AND MINISTERS WHO SURROUNDED THE ROYAL COUCH

A SUPPOSITION ENTIRELY CONTRARY TO THE USAGES OF BARBARIANS DACIA AT THIS PERIOD WAS OCCUPIED NOT BY SARMATIANS WHO HAVE NEVER FORMED A DISTINCT RACE BUT BY VANDALS WHOM THE ANCIENTS HAVE OFTEN CONFOUNDED UNDER THE GENERAL TERM SARMATIANS
AND BY EUSEBIUS OF NICOMEDIA WHO HAD ACQUIRED THE REPUTATION OF A STATESMAN WITHOUT FORFEITING THAT OF A SAINT
WHAT CONFIDENCE MUST HAVE BEEN REPOSED IN HIS INTEGRITY SINCE GRATIAN COULD TRUST THAT A PIOUS SON WOULD FORGIVE FOR THE SAKE OF THE REPUBLIC THE MURDER OF HIS FATHER
IT IS EVIDENT ON THE CONTRARY FROM THE SAME APOLOGY OF ST JUSTIN THAT THEY HARDLY EVER OBTAINED DELAY
THAT RITE WAS ALWAYS USED IN MAKING A CATECHUMEN SEE BINGHAM'S ANTIQUITIES
IN WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED ALL THE HARDSHIPS OF WAR OF FAMINE AND OF CLIMATE
WHOM HE HAD EDUCATED WITH SO MUCH CARE AND TENDERNESS
THIS LAW IS DATED IN THE YEAR 334 AND WAS ADDRESSED TO THE PRAEFECT OF ITALY WHOSE JURISDICTION EXTENDED OVER AFRICA

WHO LABORED TO RELIEVE THE DISTRESS AND TO REVIVE THE SPIRIT OF HIS SUBJECTS
119 AFTER A FRUITLESS ATTEMPT TO RECLAIM THE HAUGHTY MAGISTRATE BY MILD AND RELIGIOUS ADMONITION SYNESIUS PROCEEDS TO INFLICT THE LAST SENTENCE OF ECCLESIASTICAL JUSTICE 120 WHICH DEVOTES ANDRONICUS WITH HIS ASSOCIATES AND THEIR FAMILIES TO THE ABHORRENCE OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
AND THE ARTFUL MONK WHO HAD ASSIGNED HIMSELF THE FIRST OR POSSIBLY THE SOLE PLACE IN THE TESTAMENT OF HIS SPIRITUAL DAUGHTER STILL PRESUMED TO DECLARE WITH THE SMOOTH FACE OF HYPOCRISY THAT HE WAS ONLY THE INSTRUMENT OF CHARITY AND THE STEWARD OF THE POOR
AND MENACED THEIR DISOBEDIENCE WITH THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE CIVIL JUDGE
YET THE MOST RESPECTABLE OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO CONFESS NOT ONLY THAT THE STREETS OF JERUSALEM WERE FILLED WITH THE INCESSANT TUMULT OF BUSINESS AND PLEASURE 67 BUT THAT EVERY SPECIES OF VICE--ADULTERY THEFT IDOLATRY POISONING MURDER--WAS FAMILIAR TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOLY CITY

I CANNOT REFRAIN FROM TRANSCRIBING THE EMPHATICAL WORDS OF JULIAN

AS THE STATUES OF THE GODS SAYS THAT ORATOR WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFILED WITH FILTH ARE AGAIN PLACED IN A MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE SO THE BEAUTY OF TRUTH WAS SEATED IN THE MIND OF JULIAN AFTER IT HAD BEEN PURIFIED FROM THE ERRORS AND FOLLIES OF HIS EDUCATION

THAT EVEN ADMITTING WITHOUT HESITATION OR INQUIRY ALL THAT HISTORY HAS RECORDED OR DEVOTION HAS FEIGNED ON THE SUBJECT OF MARTYRDOMS IT MUST STILL BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CHRISTIANS IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INTESTINE DISSENSIONS HAVE INFLICTED FAR GREATER SEVERITIES ON EACH OTHER THAN THEY HAD EXPERIENCED FROM THE ZEAL OF INFIDELS

WHAT IS THE DEXTEROUS MANAGEMENT OF THE MORE INARTIFICIAL HISTORIANS OF CHRISTIANITY IN EXAGGERATING THE NUMBERS OF THE MARTYRS COMPARED TO THE UNFAIR ADDRESS WITH WHICH GIBBON HERE QUIETLY DISMISSES FROM THE ACCOUNT ALL THE HORRIBLE AND EXCRUCIATING TORTURES WHICH FELL SHORT OF DEATH

THE GUILT OF THAT ATHEIST WAS AGGRAVATED BY THE SUSPICIOUS FAVOR OF THE UNFORTUNATE GALLUS
83 THE EMPEROR MIGHT BE SALUTED AS THE FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE BUT HE OWED A FILIAL DUTY AND REVERENCE TO THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH
AND WHILE CONSTANTINE DESIGNED TO RUIN THE FOUNDATIONS HE SEEMED TO REFORM THE ABUSES OF THE ANCIENT RELIGION

THE SPANIARD DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO SUFFER UNDER CONSTANTIUS AS HE HAD SUFFERED THREESCORE YEARS BEFORE UNDER HIS GRANDFATHER MAXIMIAN
THE VANITY OF THOSE WHO FROM THEIR RANK AND OFFICE MIGHT CLAIM A SUPERIOR DISTINCTION ABOVE THE REST OF THE SENATORIAL ORDER WAS LONG AFTERWARDS INDULGED WITH THE NEW APPELLATION OF RESPECTABLE
AND THE GRIEF OF HIS AGED FATHER WAS ALLEVIATED BY THE SOLEMN PROMISE OF SAPOR THAT THE GUILTY CITY OF AMIDA SHOULD SERVE AS A FUNERAL PILE TO EXPIATE THE DEATH AND TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY OF HIS SON
AS THE CHAPEL IN WHICH THE BODY OF THE GREAT CONSTANTINE HAD BEEN DEPOSITED WAS IN A RUINOUS CONDITION THE BISHOP TRANSPORTED THOSE VENERABLE REMAINS INTO THE CHURCH OF ST ACACIUS
THE EUPHRATES WAS PROTECTED BY THE VALOR OF ARINTHEUS
BUT THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATOR WAS NOT EXEMPT FROM PREJUDICE AND PASSION
THEIR COURAGE WAS KINDLED BY HIS FREQUENT AND FAMILIAR ASSEVERATIONS FOR SUCH WISHES WERE THE OATHS OF JULIAN SO MAY I REDUCE THE PERSIANS UNDER THE YOKE THUS MAY I RESTORE THE STRENGTH AND SPLENDOR OF THE REPUBLIC THE LOVE OF FAME WAS THE ARDENT PASSION OF HIS SOUL
HE WAS PROVOKED BY THE INSULTS WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIS STATUES
THE PRINCESS CONSTANTIA THE DAUGHTER OF THE EMPEROR CONSTANTIUS AND THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE GREAT CONSTANTINE VERY NARROWLY ESCAPED
FIFTEEN TALENTS OF GOLD BEQUEATHED BY SOSIBIUS WHO DIED IN THE REIGN OF AUGUSTUS
AND WHILE THE SPLENDID TROPHIES OF SCIPIO IN THE FIELD OF ZAMA ATTRACT THE EYES OF POSTERITY THE CAMPS AND MARCHES OF THE DICTATOR AMONG THE HILLS OF THE CAMPANIA MAY CLAIM A JUSTER PROPORTION OF THE SOLID AND INDEPENDENT FAME WHICH THE GENERAL IS NOT COMPELLED TO SHARE EITHER WITH FORTUNE OR WITH HIS TROOPS
AFTER THE TROUBLES HAD CONTINUED ABOUT THREE YEARS ANTIOCHUS ONE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD EXECUTED WITH SUCCESS THE IMPERIAL COMMISSION OF RESTORING CHOSROES 57B THE SON OF TIRIDATES TO THE THRONE OF HIS FATHERS OF DISTRIBUTING HONORS AND REWARDS AMONG THE FAITHFUL SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE OF ARSACES AND OF PROCLAIMING A GENERAL AMNESTY WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY THE GREATER PART OF THE REBELLIOUS SATRAPS
THE SUN WHOSE GENIAL INFLUENCE PERVADES AND SUSTAINS THE UNIVERSE JUSTLY CLAIMED THE ADORATION OF MANKIND AS THE BRIGHT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LOGOS THE LIVELY THE RATIONAL THE BENEFICENT IMAGE OF THE INTELLECTUAL FATHER

THE HONORABLE MERCHANT OF ALEXANDRIA WHO IMPORTED THE GEMS AND SPICES OF INDIA FOR THE USE OF THE WESTERN WORLD
THE BISHOPS HELD AN HONORABLE RANK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCES AND WERE TREATED WITH DISTINCTION AND RESPECT NOT ONLY BY THE PEOPLE BUT BY THE MAGISTRATES THEMSELVES
FROM THE AGE OF CONSTANTINE TO THAT OF CLOVIS AND THEODORIC THE TEMPORAL INTERESTS BOTH OF THE ROMANS AND BARBARIANS WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE THEOLOGICAL DISPUTES OF ARIANISM
PANCIROLUS IN HIS ELABORATE COMMENTARY ASSIGNS TO THE NOTITIA A DATE ALMOST SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE THEODOSIAN CODE
1831.)--M FOOTNOTE 96
HE QUELLED THE RISING TEMPTATION BY BITING OFF HIS TONGUE THE TOTAL DISREGARD OF TRUTH AND PROBABILITY IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THESE PRIMITIVE MARTYRDOMS WAS OCCASIONED BY A VERY NATURAL MISTAKE
AND THEIR RUSTIC CHIEFS WHO ASSUMED THE APPELLATION OF TANJOU GRADUALLY BECAME THE CONQUERORS AND THE SOVEREIGNS OF A FORMIDABLE EMPIRE
108 THEY EMERGED FROM THE OBSCURITY OF MUNICIPAL HONORS BY THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE ELDER THEODOSIUS A GENERAL WHOSE EXPLOITS IN BRITAIN AND AFRICA HAVE FORMED ONE OF THE MOST SPLENDID PARTS OF THE ANNALS OF VALENTINIAN
AND ALTHOUGH JULIAN FROM HIS EARLY HABITS OF CONVERSATION AND LITERATURE WAS MORE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE BEAUTIES OF THE GREEK LANGUAGE HE HAD ATTAINED A COMPETENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LATIN TONGUE
SUCH INDEED WAS THE TEMPER OF JULIAN WHO SELDOM RECOLLECTED THE FUNDAMENTAL MAXIM OF ARISTOTLE THAT TRUE VIRTUE IS PLACED AT AN EQUAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OPPOSITE VICES
THE FLAMES OF ARIANISM MIGHT BURN FOR SOME TIME IN SECRET
MAXIMUS 46 WHO SOON ACQUIRED THE CONFIDENCE AND INFLUENCED THE COUNCILS OF JULIAN WAS INSENSIBLY CORRUPTED BY THE TEMPTATIONS OF A COURT
AND AS PAUL WHO WAS NO STRANGER TO THE ARTS OF COURTS HAD INSINUATED HIMSELF INTO THE FAVOR OF ZENOBIA HE MAINTAINED ABOVE FOUR YEARS THE POSSESSION OF THE EPISCOPAL HOUSE AND OFFICE
THE DEATH OF THEOPHILUS CONSULAR OF THE PROVINCE OF SYRIA WHO IN A TIME OF SCARCITY HAD BEEN MASSACRED BY THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH WITH THE CONNIVANCE AND ALMOST AT THE INSTIGATION OF GALLUS WAS JUSTLY RESENTED NOT ONLY AS AN ACT OF WANTON CRUELTY BUT AS A DANGEROUS INSULT ON THE SUPREME MAJESTY OF CONSTANTIUS

IN THIS CLASS THE PROCONSULS OF ASIA ACHAIA AND AFRICA CLAIMED A PREEMINENCE WHICH WAS YIELDED TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEIR ANCIENT DIGNITY
HE PRESSED SAPOR TO INVADE THE EXHAUSTED AND DEFENCELESS PROVINCES OF THE EAST WITH THE NUMEROUS ARMIES OF PERSIA NOW FORTIFIED BY THE ALLIANCE AND ACCESSION OF THE FIERCEST BARBARIANS

THE MOST DARING OF THE SCYTHIANS OF THE GOTHS AND OF THE GERMANS WHO DELIGHTED IN WAR AND WHO FOUND IT MORE PROFITABLE TO DEFEND THAN TO RAVAGE THE PROVINCES WERE ENROLLED NOT ONLY IN THE AUXILIARIES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONS BUT IN THE LEGIONS THEMSELVES AND AMONG THE MOST DISTINGUISHED OF THE PALATINE TROOPS
BUT AS THE DEGREES OF THEOLOGICAL HATRED DEPEND ON THE SPIRIT OF THE WAR RATHER THAN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTROVERSY THE HERETICS WHO DEGRADED WERE TREATED WITH MORE SEVERITY THAN THOSE WHO ANNIHILATED THE PERSON OF THE SON
THE EMPEROR CONSTANTIUS WHO IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS BROTHERS WAS THE MOST OBNOXIOUS TO GUILT AND REPROACH DISCOVERED ON SOME FUTURE OCCASIONS A FAINT AND TRANSIENT REMORSE FOR THOSE CRUELTIES WHICH THE PERFIDIOUS COUNSELS OF HIS MINISTERS AND THE IRRESISTIBLE VIOLENCE OF THE TROOPS HAD EXTORTED FROM HIS UNEXPERIENCED YOUTH

ADAUCTUS IS THE MORE REMARKABLE FOR BEING THE ONLY PERSON OF RANK AND DISTINCTION WHO APPEARS TO HAVE SUFFERED DEATH DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GENERAL PERSECUTION
AND ALTHOUGH HIS MIND WAS TAINTED BY THE CONTAGION OF FANATICISM ATHANASIUS DISPLAYED A SUPERIORITY OF CHARACTER AND ABILITIES WHICH WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED HIM FAR BETTER THAN THE DEGENERATE SONS OF CONSTANTINE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF A GREAT MONARCHY

THE LEGIONS WHICH HAD BEEN ORDERED TO MARCH INTO PANNONIA WERE IMMEDIATELY RECALLED OR DETAINED FOR THE DEFENCE OF GAUL
THEIR NATURE WHETHER ARABLE OR PASTURE OR VINEYARDS OR WOODS WAS DISTINCTLY REPORTED
THE ECCLESIASTICAL REVENUES OF EACH DIOCESE WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR PARTS FOR THE RESPECTIVE USES OF THE BISHOP HIMSELF OF HIS INFERIOR CLERGY OF THE POOR AND OF THE PUBLIC WORSHIP
THE PRAEFECT OF THE CITY WAS EMPOWERED TO CHASTISE THE IDLE AND REFRACTORY BY STRIPES OR EXPULSION
BUT AN IMPARTIAL NARRATIVE OF THE EXECUTIONS OR RATHER MURDERS WHICH SULLIED THE DECLINING AGE OF CONSTANTINE WILL SUGGEST TO OUR MOST CANDID THOUGHTS THE IDEA OF A PRINCE WHO COULD SACRIFICE WITHOUT RELUCTANCE THE LAWS OF JUSTICE AND THE FEELINGS OF NATURE TO THE DICTATES EITHER OF HIS PASSIONS OR OF HIS INTEREST

BUT THE GATES OF THE CITY WERE STRICTLY GUARDED AND THE BARBARIANS WERE STERNLY EXCLUDED FROM THE USE OF A PLENTIFUL MARKET TO WHICH THEY ASSERTED THEIR EQUAL CLAIM OF SUBJECTS AND ALLIES
THAT OF PHINEUS WAS IN EUROPE NEAR THE VILLAGE OF MAUROMOLE AND THE BLACK SEA
26 27 THE DEVOUT AND FEARLESS CURIOSITY OF JULIAN TEMPTED THE PHILOSOPHERS WITH THE HOPES OF AN EASY CONQUEST
AND IN THIS TUMULTUOUS PASSAGE MANY WERE SWEPT AWAY AND DROWNED BY THE RAPID VIOLENCE OF THE CURRENT
ACCORDING TO THE GRAVE POLYBIUS NO MORE THAN 370 HORSE AND 3,000 FOOT ESCAPED FROM THE FIELD OF CANNAE
THE APPREHENSIONS OF THE GAULS WERE DERIVED FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPENDING AND INEVITABLE DANGER
YET THIS SIGNAL VICTORY WHICH WAS PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY MANY BLOODY ENGAGEMENTS CONTRIBUTED MUCH LESS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE POWER OF THE HUNS THAN THE EFFECTUAL POLICY WHICH WAS EMPLOYED TO DETACH THE TRIBUTARY NATIONS FROM THEIR OBEDIENCE
HIS DUTY WAS TO ATTEND THE EMPEROR IN HIS HOURS OF STATE OR IN THOSE OF AMUSEMENT AND TO PERFORM ABOUT HIS PERSON ALL THOSE MENIAL SERVICES WHICH CAN ONLY DERIVE THEIR SPLENDOR FROM THE INFLUENCE OF ROYALTY
JULIAN MARCHED OVER THE SAME GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN TROD ABOVE SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE BY THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE YOUNGER CYRUS AND WHICH IS DESCRIBED BY ONE OF THE COMPANIONS OF HIS EXPEDITION THE SAGE AND HEROIC XENOPHON

THE TITLE OF CONSUL WAS STILL THE MOST SPLENDID OBJECT OF AMBITION THE NOBLEST REWARD OF VIRTUE AND LOYALTY

THERE ARE NOT WANTING SAYS THE CANDID LIBANIUS THOSE WHO ARRAIGN THE PRUDENCE OF THE EMPEROR OR WHO IMPUTE THE PUBLIC MISFORTUNE TO THE WANT OF COURAGE AND DISCIPLINE IN THE TROOPS
THE SCATTERED AND DESULTORY WARFARE OF THE BARBARIANS WHO INFESTED THE LAND AND SEA DEPRIVED HIM OF THE GLORY OF A SIGNAL VICTORY

63 BUT THE SEVERE RULES OF DISCIPLINE WHICH THE PRUDENCE OF THE BISHOPS HAD INSTITUTED WERE RELAXED BY THE SAME PRUDENCE IN FAVOR OF AN IMPERIAL PROSELYTE WHOM IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ALLURE BY EVERY GENTLE CONDESCENSION INTO THE PALE OF THE CHURCH

IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THEY SWAM THE TIGRIS SURPRISED AN UNGUARDED POST OF THE ENEMY AND DISPLAYED AT THE DAWN OF DAY THE SIGNAL OF THEIR RESOLUTION AND FORTUNE
BUT HE OPPRESSED WITH AN IMPARTIAL HAND THE VARIOUS INHABITANTS OF HIS EXTENSIVE DIOCESE
THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE GRECIAN MYTHOLOGY PROCLAIMED WITH A CLEAR AND AUDIBLE VOICE THAT THE PIOUS INQUIRER INSTEAD OF BEING SCANDALIZED OR SATISFIED WITH THE LITERAL SENSE SHOULD DILIGENTLY EXPLORE THE OCCULT WISDOM WHICH HAD BEEN DISGUISED BY THE PRUDENCE OF ANTIQUITY UNDER THE MASK OF FOLLY AND OF FABLE
182 182A AS WE ARE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE DEGREE OF EPISCOPAL ZEAL AND COURAGE WHICH PREVAILED AT THAT TIME IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER TO DRAW ANY USEFUL INFERENCES FROM THE FORMER OF THESE FACTS
AND CONSTANTINE ENDEAVORED TO CONVINCE THEIR CHIEFS BY A LIBERAL DISTRIBUTION OF HONORS AND REWARDS HOW FAR THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE ROMANS WAS PREFERABLE TO THEIR ENMITY
THESE DEPUTIES WERE INSTRUCTED TO SOOTHE THE RESENTMENT AND TO ALARM THE FEARS OF CONSTANTIUS
SOME OF THE HAPPY SAVAGES WHO DWELL BETWEEN THE TROPICS ARE PLENTIFULLY NOURISHED BY THE LIBERALITY OF NATURE
THE SON OF THAT GENERAL WHO LIKEWISE BORE THE NAME OF THEODOSIUS WAS EDUCATED BY SKILFUL PRECEPTORS IN THE LIBERAL STUDIES OF YOUTH
AND THE REIGN OF CONSTANTIUS WAS DISGRACED BY THE UNJUST AND INEFFECTUAL PERSECUTION OF THE GREAT ATHANASIUS

52 BUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BOTH OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST HAS ADOPTED A PRODIGY WHICH FAVORS OR SEEMS TO FAVOR THE POPULAR WORSHIP OF THE CROSS
HE REVIVED INDEED THE TITLE OF PATRICIANS BUT HE REVIVED IT AS A PERSONAL NOT AS AN HEREDITARY DISTINCTION
AND IN THE LOVE OF ARMS WHICH CONSIDERED WAR AND RAPINE AS THE PLEASURE AND THE GLORY OF MANKIND
HE DIVIDED CONSTANTINOPLE INTO FOURTEEN REGIONS OR QUARTERS 60 DIGNIFIED THE PUBLIC COUNCIL WITH THE APPELLATION OF SENATE 61 COMMUNICATED TO THE CITIZENS THE PRIVILEGES OF ITALY 62 AND BESTOWED ON THE RISING CITY THE TITLE OF COLONY THE FIRST AND MOST FAVORED DAUGHTER OF ANCIENT ROME
AS THE ROMANS CONTINUED THEIR MARCH THEIR LONG ARRAY WHICH WAS FORCED TO BEND OR DIVIDE ACCORDING TO THE VARIETIES OF THE GROUND AFFORDED FREQUENT AND FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO THEIR VIGILANT ENEMIES
114 115
AND THE STRANGE AND HORRID CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH MIGHT EXCITE A SUSPICION THAT THE ORTHODOX SAINTS HAD CONTRIBUTED MORE EFFICACIOUSLY THAN BY THEIR PRAYERS TO DELIVER THE CHURCH FROM THE MOST FORMIDABLE OF HER ENEMIES
BY WHILE HE REQUIRED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL HE AVOIDED THE ODIOUS NAME OF ARIUS

THE CONFESSIONS OF THOSE WHO WERE SEIZED DISCOVERED A GREAT MULTITUDE OF THEIR ACCOMPLICES AND THEY WERE ALL CONVICTED NOT SO MUCH FOR THE CRIME OF SETTING FIRE TO THE CITY AS FOR THEIR HATRED OF HUMAN KIND
AND WE MAY STILL REMARK A VERY SINGULAR FRAGMENT OF ANTIQUITY
THE GENEROUS COURTESY WHICH WAS SHOWN TO THE FIRST AMONG THEIR CHIEFTAINS WHO IMPLORED THE CLEMENCY OF CONSTANTIUS ENCOURAGED THE MORE TIMID OR THE MORE OBSTINATE TO IMITATE THEIR EXAMPLE

REIGNS OF JOVIAN AND VALENTINIAN DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE.--PART IV
THE VENOM WAS COMMONLY EXTRACTED FROM THE VEGETABLE REIGN
135 FOOTNOTE 133
AND WAS ALWAYS PREPARED TO TAKE THE FIELD EITHER AGAINST A FOREIGN OR A DOMESTIC ENEMY
702 FOOTNOTE 117
AND SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENTS SOON INTRODUCED AN OPINION THAT AS LONG AS THE GUARDS OF THE LABARUM WERE ENGAGED IN THE EXECUTION OF THEIR OFFICE THEY WERE SECURE AND INVULNERABLE AMIDST THE DARTS OF THE ENEMY
AND THEIR HOUSES FILLED WITH SPOIL AND PROVISIONS WERE OCCUPIED BY THE SOLDIERS OF JULIAN WHO MASSACRED WITHOUT REMORSE AND WITHOUT PUNISHMENT SOME DEFENCELESS WOMEN
THE TROOPS OF THE HUNS AND THE ALANI WOULD NATURALLY UPBRAID THE FLIGHT OF THE GOTHS
THE LEADERS OF THE OSTROGOTHS ALATHEUS AND SAPHRAX THE GUARDIANS OF THEIR INFANT KING APPEARED SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE NORTHERN BANKS OF THE DANUBE
FOR THIS AND THE OTHER DIGNITIES OF THE EMPIRE IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO REFER TO THE AMPLE COMMENTARIES OF PANCIROLUS AND GODEFROY WHO HAVE DILIGENTLY COLLECTED AND ACCURATELY DIGESTED IN THEIR PROPER ORDER ALL THE LEGAL AND HISTORICAL MATERIALS
THE DIVISION WAS MADE WITH A JUST REGARD TO THEIR PECULIAR MERIT AND SITUATION AND SEVEN MASTER-GENERALS WERE SOON CREATED EITHER OF THE CAVALRY OR INFANTRY
2 FOOTNOTE 87
BEFORE THEY WERE ENTIRELY CONSUMED HE MIGHT STILL HAVE REACHED THE WEALTHY AND UNWARLIKE CITIES OF ECBATANA OR SUSA BY THE EFFORT OF A RAPID AND WELL-DIRECTED MARCH
185 FOOTNOTE 71A
AURELIUS VICTOR EXPRESSES THE GENERAL OPINION BY A VULGAR AND INDEED OBSCURE PROVERB
ABOUT THE YEAR 276 IT WAS THE RELIGION OF THE KING THE NOBLES AND THE PEOPLE OF ARMENIA
BUT THE VIGILANT CITIZENS IMPROVED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE NIGHT
XLII FOOTNOTE 88
AND ADVISED THE EMPRESS WITH HER SON VALENTINIAN TO FIX THEIR RESIDENCE AT MILAN IN THE FAIR AND PEACEFUL PROVINCE OF ITALY
AND DURING AT LEAST FOUR MONTHS ALEXANDRIA WAS EXPOSED TO THE INSULTS OF A LICENTIOUS ARMY STIMULATED BY THE ECCLESIASTICS OF A HOSTILE FACTION
AND IN THE COUNCILS WHICH WERE ASSEMBLED UNDER THE GRACIOUS PROTECTION OF CONSTANTINE THE AUTHORITY OF THE BISHOPS WAS SEASONABLY EMPLOYED TO RATIFY THE OBLIGATION OF THE MILITARY OATH AND TO INFLICT THE PENALTY OF EXCOMMUNICATION ON THOSE SOLDIERS WHO THREW AWAY THEIR ARMS DURING THE PEACE OF THE CHURCH
AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE TRUCE JULIAN UNDERTOOK A SECOND EXPEDITION BEYOND THE RHINE TO HUMBLE THE PRIDE OF SURMAR AND HORTAIRE TWO OF THE KINGS OF THE ALEMANNI WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BATTLE OF STRASBURGH
THE IMMORTAL NAME OF ATHANASIUS 96 WILL NEVER BE SEPARATED FROM THE CATHOLIC DOCTRINE OF THE TRINITY TO WHOSE DEFENCE HE CONSECRATED EVERY MOMENT AND EVERY FACULTY OF HIS BEING
THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE FORMER IS OBVIOUS
HE CONCEIVES THAT THEOPHILUS WAS BORN IN THE ISLAND OF DAHLAK IN THE ARABIAN GULF
BENEDICTIN
BUT IT WAS NOT BEFORE HE TRAMPLED ON THE RUINS OF MAOGAMALCHA THAT HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO SAY WE HAVE NOW PROVIDED SOME MATERIALS FOR THE SOPHIST OF ANTIOCH 64 FOOTNOTE 58
BUT IT WILL ONLY LEAD US TO ADMIRE THE ARTFUL MANAGEMENT OF THE HISTORIAN
136 THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE WHICH WERE NO LONGER COUNTENANCED BY THE MAGISTRATES WERE STILL COMMITTED BY THE ZEAL OF THE PEOPLE
36A THE USURPER IMPROVED THIS UNEXPECTED SUCCESS WITH SOME DEGREE OF COURAGE AND DEXTERITY
75 AT THE VERY TIME WHEN HE DECLINED THE SIEGE OF CTESIPHON HE REJECTED WITH OBSTINACY AND DISDAIN THE MOST FLATTERING OFFERS OF A NEGOTIATION OF PEACE
THE LEARNED DR LARDNER JEWISH AND HEATHEN TESTIMONIES VOL II
AS THE JUSTICE OF THE SENTENCE WAS PUBLICLY AVOWED BY THE WHOLE PARTY THE ONLY MOTIVE WHICH COULD RESTRAIN CONSTANTIUS FROM GIVING HIS MESSENGERS THE SANCTION OF A WRITTEN MANDATE MUST BE IMPUTED TO HIS DOUBT OF THE EVENT
IN THE SECOND CIVIL WAR LICINIUS FELT AND DREADED THE POWER OF THIS CONSECRATED BANNER THE SIGHT OF WHICH IN THE DISTRESS OF BATTLE ANIMATED THE SOLDIERS OF CONSTANTINE WITH AN INVINCIBLE ENTHUSIASM AND SCATTERED TERROR AND DISMAY THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE ADVERSE LEGIONS
THE JUDICIOUS CHOICE WAS APPLAUDED
I SHELTER MYSELF BEHIND MAIMONIDES MARSHAM SPENCER LE CLERC WARBURTON C WHO HAVE FAIRLY DERIDED THE FEARS THE FOLLY AND THE FALSEHOOD OF SOME SUPERSTITIOUS DIVINES
WHEN SHE WAS ASKED WHAT GOOD WOULD COME OF SO MUCH PAINFUL TROUBLE SHE ANSWERED IT IS THUS THAT CHRIST THE SON OF GOD IS TO BE HONORED SOZOMEN II
A SPIRIT OF DISCORD AROSE AMONG THE INDEPENDENT TRIBES AND NATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN UNITED ONLY BY THE BANDS OF A LOOSE AND VOLUNTARY ALLIANCE
THE MOST ACTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL OF THE PLEBEIANS ACCUMULATED WEALTH ASPIRED TO HONORS DESERVED TRIUMPHS CONTRACTED ALLIANCES AND AFTER SOME GENERATIONS ASSUMED THE PRIDE OF ANCIENT NOBILITY
250 L CAP
QUOD SI EXPONENDAM PUTAVERIT ANIMADVERSIONI QUAE CONSTITUTA EST SUBJACEBIT
IN THE SPACE OF FOURTEEN YEARS HE WAS FIVE TIMES DRIVEN FROM HIS THRONE
THE TROOPS WERE SOLEMNLY ASSEMBLED
286 WITH THE PASSIONATE EXCLAMATIONS OF GREGORY ORAT
HIS FORMIDABLE HOST WHEN IT WAS DRAWN OUT IN ORDER OF BATTLE COVERED THE BANKS OF THE RIVER THE ADJACENT HEIGHTS AND THE WHOLE EXTENT OF A PLAIN OF ABOVE TWELVE MILES WHICH SEPARATED THE TWO ARMIES
AND THE RETURN OF DAY DISCOVERED A NEW WALL OF SIX FEET IN HEIGHT RISING EVERY MOMENT TO FILL UP THE INTERVAL OF THE BREACH
IF ON THE CONTRARY THEY FAILED IN THEIR PROOFS THEY INCURRED THE SEVERE AND PERHAPS CAPITAL PENALTY WHICH ACCORDING TO A LAW PUBLISHED BY THE EMPEROR HADRIAN WAS INFLICTED ON THOSE WHO FALSELY ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS THE CRIME OF CHRISTIANITY
BUT THE PROVINCIAL MINISTERS OF HIS AUTHORITY WERE PLACED IN A LESS CONSPICUOUS STATION

47-71 THE SILENCE OF JEROM WOULD LEAD TO A SUSPICION THAT THE SAME STORY WHICH WAS CELEBRATED AT A DISTANCE MIGHT BE DESPISED ON THE SPOT
15 IN THE MIDST OF THE FESTIVAL THE UNFORTUNATE CRISPUS WAS APPREHENDED BY ORDER OF THE EMPEROR WHO LAID ASIDE THE TENDERNESS OF A FATHER WITHOUT ASSUMING THE EQUITY OF A JUDGE
THIS ACCESSION OF TERRITORY MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY VERY SPECIOUS REASONS
AFTER SAPOR HAD TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS THE EFFICACY OF FORCE AND OF STRATAGEM HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE SLOWER BUT MORE CERTAIN OPERATIONS OF A REGULAR SIEGE IN THE CONDUCT OF WHICH HE WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE SKILL OF THE ROMAN DESERTERS
JULIAN MISOPOGON P
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE TARTAR PRINCES ASSUMED THE MILITARY COMMAND TO WHICH HE WAS ENTITLED BY THE SUPERIORITY EITHER OF MERIT OR OF POWER
73 BUT WHEN THEY LOST EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF THOSE VIRTUES WHICH WERE DERIVED FROM THEIR ANCIENT FREEDOM THE SIMPLICITY OF ROMAN MANNERS WAS INSENSIBLY CORRUPTED BY THE STATELY AFFECTATION OF THE COURTS OF ASIA
BIBLIOTHEQUE ORIENTALE P
AND HE EMPLOYED WITH THAT VIEW THE VARIOUS MARCHES EVOLUTIONS AND STRATAGEMS WHICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ART OF WAR COULD SUGGEST TO AN EXPERIENCED OFFICER
THIS NAME OF SYRIAC ORIGIN IS FOUND IN THE ARABIC AND MEANS A PLACE IN A VALLEY WHERE WATERS MEET
4 AND OF THE SYLVAN REIGN OF AMYCUS WHO DEFIED THE SON OF LEDA TO THE COMBAT OF THE CESTUS
FRAVITTA ALARMED AND EXASPERATED BY THE INSOLENCE OF HIS RIVAL WHOSE DEPARTURE FROM THE PALACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SIGNAL OF A CIVIL WAR BOLDLY FOLLOWED HIM
310 314 AND JEROM IN CHRON

THE LONG AND MEMORABLE QUARREL OF IRAN AND TOURAN IS STILL THE THEME OF HISTORY OR ROMANCE
WHILE THE PUBLIC DEVOTION WAS INTERRUPTED BY SHOUTS OF RAGE AND CRIES OF TERROR HE ANIMATED HIS TREMBLING CONGREGATION TO EXPRESS THEIR RELIGIOUS CONFIDENCE BY CHANTING ONE OF THE PSALMS OF DAVID WHICH CELEBRATES THE TRIUMPH OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL OVER THE HAUGHTY AND IMPIOUS TYRANT OF EGYPT
WITH THE AID OF AN OLD MANUSCRIPT VALESIUS HAS RECTIFIED THE FIRST OF THESE CORRUPTIONS AND WE PERCEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT IN THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE WORD VAFER

THE TYRANTS WHO WOULD HAVE DISGRACED THE SOCIETY OF GODS AND MEN WERE THROWN HEADLONG BY THE INEXORABLE NEMESIS INTO THE TARTAREAN ABYSS
THE HISTORIAN MIGHT HAVE VIEWED THESE PLAINS EITHER AS A SOLDIER OR AS A TRAVELLER
THE SPIRIT AND EVEN THE FORMS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED IN A PROMISCUOUS MASSACRE
HE WAS IGNORANT OF THE OLD NAME AND CONDITION OF ANNAH
A SEVERE INQUISITION WAS EXTENDED OVER ALL WHO EITHER FROM CHOICE OR FROM COMPULSION HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CAUSE OF REBELLION
HER PERSON WAS SAVED FROM DANGER AND THE REPUBLIC FROM DISGRACE BY THE ACTIVE ZEAL OF MESSALA GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCES
SENESCENTES ETIAM ET FORTUITIS MORTIBUS MUNDO DIGRESSOS UT DEGENERES ET IGNAVOS CONVICIIS ATROCIBUS INSECTANTUR
HE HAD CONDEMNED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MOST RATIONAL PAGANS THE LICENSE OF NOCTURNAL SACRIFICES
73 3
AND WHEN THE ELECTION OF AN EMPEROR WAS PROPOSED THE SPIRIT OF FACTION BEGAN TO AGITATE THE ASSEMBLY
BUT HE SOON RECEIVED THE GRATEFUL INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS AUTHORITY WAS ACKNOWLEDGED FROM THE THRACIAN BOSPHORUS TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
FOL FOOTNOTE 186
RODOSACES-MALEK IS KING
ON THE CALENDS OF JANUARY AT BREAK OF DAY THE NEW CONSULS MAMERTINUS AND NEVITTA HASTENED TO THE PALACE TO SALUTE THE EMPEROR
BUT THE SERIES OF THEIR KINGS DOES NOT COMMENCE TILL THE YEAR 230 HIST
THE COMMENTARY OF GODEFROY TOM
HE SECRETLY COMPARED THE IGNOMINIOUS AT LEAST THE INGLORIOUS PERIOD OF HIS OWN REIGN WITH THE FAME OF A BEARDLESS YOUTH
THE PUBLIC ESTABLISHMENT OF CHRISTIANITY MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT AND DOMESTIC REVOLUTIONS WHICH EXCITE THE MOST LIVELY CURIOSITY AND AFFORD THE MOST VALUABLE INSTRUCTION

TO WHOM THEY IMPRUDENTLY OR MALICIOUSLY REVEALED THE WEAKNESS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
114 THEIR OFFENCE HAD IT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PROVED MIGHT HAVE JUSTIFIED THE RETALIATION WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED BY THE ORDER OF JULIAN OF SHUTTING THE DOORS AND CONFISCATING THE WEALTH OF THE CATHEDRAL OF ANTIOCH
THE BISHOPS WHO HAD OPPOSED WERE REQUIRED TO SUBSCRIBE THE SENTENCE AND TO UNITE IN RELIGIOUS COMMUNION WITH THE SUSPECTED LEADERS OF THE ADVERSE PARTY
BUT THE GROVES OF DAPHNE CONTINUED FOR MANY AGES TO ENJOY THE VENERATION OF NATIVES AND STRANGERS
AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER SEVERUS THE ROMANS BEHELD AN EMPEROR WHO MADE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS DUTIES AND HIS PLEASURES
THE ROMANS AFTER SENDING UP A MILITARY SHOUT ADVANCED IN MEASURED STEPS TO THE ANIMATING NOTES OF MARTIAL MUSIC
SEE IN PARTICULAR VIII
GUTHERIUS DE OFFICIIS DOMUS AUGUSTAE L
AND AS THEIR MANGLED BODIES WERE DRAGGED THROUGH THE STREETS THEY WERE PIERCED SUCH WAS THE UNIVERSAL RAGE BY THE SPITS OF COOKS AND THE DISTAFFS OF ENRAGED WOMEN
THE SUBSEQUENT WITNESSES SOCRATES SOZOMEN THEODORET PHILOSTORGIUS C ADD CONTRADICTIONS RATHER THAN AUTHORITY
HE SUPPOSES THAT MAXIMILIAN WAS NOT PRODUCED BY HIS FATHER AS A RECRUIT BUT WAS OBLIGED TO APPEAR BY THE LAW WHICH COMPELLED THE SONS OF SOLDIERS TO SERVE AT 21 YEARS OLD
140 THE HISTORY OF PRINCES DOES NOT VERY FREQUENTLY RENEW THE EXAMPLES OF A SIMILAR COMPETITION

GIBBON OUGHT TO HAVE SAID WAS FALSELY ACCUSED OF ROBBERY FOR SO IT IS IN THE GREEK TEXT
BUT THE FIRST AND MOST SERIOUS CARE OF JULIAN WAS TO DELIVER HIS OPPRESSED DEITY FROM THE ODIOUS PRESENCE OF THE DEAD AND LIVING CHRISTIANS WHO HAD SO EFFECTUALLY SUPPRESSED THE VOICE OF FRAUD OR ENTHUSIASM

NOR CAN THE MILITARY CONDUCT OF THE EMPEROR BE CLEARLY APPREHENDED WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS THE THEATRE OF HIS BOLD AND SKILFUL OPERATIONS
THE EMPEROR SAID TO THE BISHOP ACESIUS TAKE A LADDER AND GET UP TO HEAVEN BY YOURSELF MOST OF THE CHRISTIAN SECTS HAVE BY TURNS BORROWED THE LADDER OF ACESIUS THE COMPLAINTS AND MUTUAL ACCUSATIONS WHICH ASSAILED THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINE AS SOON AS THE DEATH OF MAXENTIUS HAD SUBMITTED AFRICA TO HIS VICTORIOUS ARMS WERE ILL ADAPTED TO EDIFY AN IMPERFECT PROSELYTE

BUT THE IMPATIENT BARBARIAN COULD NOT LONG SURVIVE HIS DEFEAT HIS CONFINEMENT AND HIS EXILE
