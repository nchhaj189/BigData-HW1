THAT POLYGAMY IS RIGHT AND THAT NO MAN SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN ONE WIFE
WE ARE ENGAGED IN BUSINESS DURING THE WEEK
THE FIRST STRIKE THAT IS A GREAT SUCCESS WILL BE THE LAST BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN LAW AND ORDER WILL PUT THE STRIKERS DOWN
WHEN THEY LEFT HEROD THE STAR AGAIN APPEARED AND WENT BEFORE THEM UNTIL IT STOOD OVER THE PLACE WHERE THE CHILD WAS
HE HAS PERMITTED BLASPHEMERS TO FLAY HIS WORSHIPERS ALIVE TO DISLOCATE THEIR JOINTS UPON RACKS AND TO BURN THEM AT THE STAKE
THEY BEGAN TO EXAMINE SOILS AND ROCKS
CONTRADICT US AND YOU WILL BECOME ETERNAL CONVICTS IN THE PRISON OF GOD THIS IS THE FREEDOM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
THEY PRETEND TO BELIEVE IN MORAL SUASION AND WANT EVERYTHING REGULATED BY LAW
AFTERWARD ANOTHER REPRESENTATION OF THE STARS WAS FOUND AND BY CALCULATING IN THE SAME WAY IT WAS FOUND THAT THE STARS DID OCCUPY THE EXACT POSITIONS REPRESENTED ABOUT THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
LET THEM BE MADE FAMILIAR WITH THE GREATEST OF POEMS THE FINEST PARAGRAPHS OF LITERATURE WITH STORIES OF THE HEROIC THE SELF-DENYING AND GENEROUS
THE SAME WITH THE TAILOR
THAT AT THAT PLACE CHRIST WAS BORN AND LAID IN A MANGER
WHILE THE TRUE BELIEVERS WERE FLAYING PHILOSOPHERS AND EXTINGUISHING THE EYES OF THINKERS THESE GODLESS FOLLOWERS OF MOHAMMED WERE FOUNDING COLLEGES COLLECTING MANUSCRIPTS INVESTIGATING THE FACTS OF NATURE AND GIVING THEIR ATTENTION TO SCIENCE
NO MATTER WHAT HIS CLASS NO MATTER WHAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES LET HIM TELL HIS THOUGHT
SO THOUSANDS HAVE ENDEAVORED TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF GOD BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED THE MORAL SENSE
THAT BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN WE CAN AVOID SOME OF THE DANGERS SOME OF THE EVILS OVERCOME SOME OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE FACTS AND FORCES OF NATURE
THE WISDOM OF THE WORLD CANNOT EXPLAIN ONE BLADE OF GRASS THE FAINTEST MOTION OF THE SMALLEST LEAF
IT TAUGHT THE AWFUL DOCTRINE OF WITCHCRAFT
IN THIS ACCOUNT JESUS ASKED THE DEVIL HIS NAME AND THE DEVIL REPLIED LEGION IN THE NINTH CHAPTER IS TOLD THE STORY OF THE DEVIL THAT THE DISCIPLES COULD NOT CAST OUT BUT WAS CAST OUT BY CHRIST AND IN THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER IT IS SAID THAT THE PHARISEES CAME TO JESUS TELLING HIM TO GO AWAY BECAUSE HEROD WOULD KILL HIM AND JESUS SAID UNTO THESE PHARISEES
THE BRIBE IS NOT EVIDENCE
HE PICTURED HIS LONELY LIFE HIS FRIENDLESS DEATH
IN THOSE DAYS THE PRIESTS WERE FISHERS FOR MONEY AND THEY USED THESE RELICS FOR BAIT
I WAS FREE--FREE TO THINK TO EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS--FREE TO LIVE TO MY OWN IDEAL--FREE TO LIVE FOR MYSELF AND THOSE I LOVED--FREE TO USE ALL MY FACULTIES ALL MY SENSES--FREE TO SPREAD IMAGINATION'S WINGS--FREE TO INVESTIGATE TO GUESS AND DREAM AND HOPE--FREE TO JUDGE AND DETERMINE FOR MYSELF--FREE TO REJECT ALL IGNORANT AND CRUEL CREEDS ALL THE INSPIRED BOOKS THAT SAVAGES HAVE PRODUCED AND ALL THE BARBAROUS LEGENDS OF THE PAST--FREE FROM POPES AND PRIESTS--FREE FROM ALL THE CALLED AND SET APART"--FREE FROM SANCTIFIED MISTAKES AND HOLY LIES--FREE FROM THE FEAR OF ETERNAL PAIN--FREE FROM THE WINGED MONSTERS OF THE NIGHT--FREE FROM DEVILS GHOSTS AND GODS
A MAN WHO LOVED THIS WORLD THIS LIFE THE THINGS OF EVERY DAY AND PLACED ABOVE ALL ELSE THE THRILLING ECSTASIES OF HUMAN LOVE
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY LOYAL TO WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS TRUTH
SO I THINK THAT CHRIST IN HIS UTTERANCES WAS TRUE TO HIS THEORY TO HIS PHILOSOPHY
LIBERTY IS THE BREATH OF PROGRESS
THAT HE HAS MADE HIS LAST VISIT
WITHOUT LIBERTY THERE IS NO RELIGION--NO WORSHIP
AND THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT ONLY THAT WHICH IN SOME SENSE IS REALLY USEFUL
I WANT IF POSSIBLE TO GET THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE TENEMENTS OUT OF THE GUTTERS OF DEGRADATION TO HOMES WHERE THERE CAN BE PRIVACY WHERE THESE PEOPLE CAN FEEL THAT THEY ARE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NATURE
WHAT IS SUCH A GOD WORTH
HOW CAN MANKIND BE REFORMED WITHOUT RELIGION?--VI
IT KNEW THIS AND SO KNOWING IT BECAME THE ENEMY OF DISCUSSION OF INVESTIGATION OF THOUGHT
WE CANNOT ASSERT WE CAN ONLY HOPE
DELUSION AND ILLUSION THE MONSTROUS AND MIRACULOUS RULED THE WORLD
HE CHALLENGED THE WORLD
THE MACHINES OF ENGLAND HAVE PRODUCED ONE OVER 1000 MILES IN LENGTH FROM THE SAME QUANTITY
DOES ONE OF OUR SENSES CERTIFY TO THEIR EXISTENCE
PEOPLE WERE CHARGED WITH THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE CRIMES
IN ANCIENT TIMES AGRICULTURE WAS KNOWN ONLY TO SLAVES
THERE IS ANOTHER MISTAKE IN THE BIBLE
HAS THIS GOD GOOD SENSE
MUST EVERY ONE SITTING BY THE FIRESIDE THINK OF SOME POOR MOTHER WITH A CHILD STRAINED TO HER BREAST SHIVERING IN THE STORM
ANY OF THE FACTS THAT AFFECT THE LIFE OF MAN
THIS IS ENOUGH
WHETHER HE IS LIVING YET OR NOT I AM NOT CERTAIN
I HAVE EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IDEA
WE CARRY THE KEY OF HELL
THEIR COURAGE SHOULD EQUAL THEIR INTELLIGENCE
IT POLLUTED THE FOUNTAINS OF JOY
THEY DO NOT LIKE TO DIFFER WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS
NATURE GENEROUS AND HEARTLESS EXTRAVAGANT AND MISERLY AS SHE IS IS OUR MOTHER AND OUR ONLY TEACHER AND SHE IS ALSO THE DECEIVER OF MEN
THEY HAVE CREATED GODS AND DEVILS HEAVENS AND HELLS
SHALL WE THANK THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES
THEN THEY CHANGED THE MEANING OF THE INSPIRED BOOK TO FIT THE FACTS
NEITHER DO WE KNOW ON WHAT FOOD HE LIVED
I ADMIT THAT LUNACY COMES NEARER
THAT WORD BRUTALIZES THE NEW TESTAMENT CHANGES THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT TO HYPOCRISY AND CANT AND POLLUTES AND HARDENS THE VERY HEART OF CHRIST
THE MOST CUNNING SPINNERS OF INDIA COULD MAKE A THREAD OVER 100 MILES LONG FROM ONE POUND OF COTTON
IF THERE BE GODS WE CANNOT HELP THEM BUT WE CAN ASSIST OUR FELLOW-MEN
DEPART YE CURSED INTO EVERLASTING FIRE PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS I CAME NOT TO BRING PEACE BUT A SWORD ALL THESE SAYINGS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UTTERED BY THE SAME PERSON
ACCORDING TO THE CELESTIAL MULTIPLICATION TABLE ONCE ONE IS THREE AND THREE TIMES ONE IS ONE AND ACCORDING TO HEAVENLY SUBTRACTION IF WE TAKE TWO FROM THREE THREE ARE LEFT
EVERY ORTHODOX CHURCH IS FOUNDED ON MISTAKE AND FALSEHOOD
I NEVER HAD A GOOD SUIT OF CLOTHES
THAT THE DEVIL WAS REALLY THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH AND THAT TO TAKE HIM AWAY WAS TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM
THE BABES THAT ARE THEN BORN WILL BE WELCOME
HE WILL SATISFY HIS WANTS GRATIFY HIS TASTES
THE OLD CREEDS ARE TOO NARROW THEY ARE NOT FOR THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE
THE ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY BECAME KNOWN
IN DEFENCE OF ALL THESE CREEDS ALL THESE CONTRADICTIONS THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN MILLIONS OF SERMONS HAVE BEEN PREACHED COUNTLESS SWORDS REDDENED WITH BLOOD AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF NIGHTS MADE LURID WITH THE FAGGOT'S FLAMES
HOW COULD JOSEPH KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN VISITED BY AN ANGEL IN A DREAM
ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT USEFULNESS IS THE BUD AND FLOWER AND FRUIT OF REAL RELIGION
THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED
THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM THIS IS THE ABYSS OF DEGRADATION
DID THEY FIND THE MEDICINAL VIRTUE THAT DWELLS IN ANY WEED OR FLOWER
THAT THEY FILL DUNGEONS WITH THE LIGHT OF THEIR PRESENCE AND GIVE HOPE TO THE IMPRISONED
IN JUDGING OF THE RICH TWO THINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
LET US CULTIVATE COURAGE AND CHEERFULNESS--OPEN OUR HEARTS TO THE GOOD--OUR MINDS TO THE TRUE
HIS OBJECT AND HIS ONLY OBJECT SHOULD BE TO FIND THE TRUTH
THIS PERPETUAL INSINCERITY STAMPS ITSELF ON THE FACE--AFFECTS EVERY FEATURE
THERE WERE NO OPERAS NO THEATRES NO AMUSEMENT EXCEPT PARTIES AND BALLS
THE TESTAMENT TEACHES THAT THE BODIES OF THE DEAD ARE TO BE RAISED
THE MICROSCOPE DISCOVERED GERMS OF DISEASE AND TAUGHT US HOW TO STAY THE PLAGUE
IN READING THE HISTORY OF THOSE DARK AND BLOODY YEARS I AM AMAZED AT THE WICKEDNESS THE FOLLY AND PRESUMPTION OF MANKIND
IN OTHER WORDS LET EVERY HUMAN BEING DO ALL THE GOOD HE CAN AND LET HIM BIND UP THE WOUNDS OF HIS FELLOW-CREATURES AND AT THE SAME TIME PUT FORTH EVERY EFFORT TO HASTEN THE COMING OF A BETTER DAY
A DIFFERENCE OF CEREMONY
THE ORTHODOX RELIGION OF OUR DAY HAS NO FOUNDATION IN TRUTH
LET EDUCATION COMMENCE IN THE CRADLE--IN THE LAP OF THE LOVING MOTHER
HE IS NO LONGER THE PERFECT
IT IS NOT ONLY UNSCIENTIFIC BUT IT IS HEARTLESS
THEN THERE IS ANOTHER THING
THERE IS NO HALF-WAY GROUND
WHERE DID THE SERPENT GET HIS
THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD THE TRUTH
HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY JUST BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
I THINK THE GREAT RAILROADS SHOULD PAY PENSIONS TO THEIR WORN OUT EMPLOYEES
IT WAS ALSO THE LAW THAT THEIR CHILDREN COULD FOLLOW NO OTHER OCCUPATION THAN THAT OF THEIR FATHERS
GIRLS WERE CONVICTED FOR HAVING CHANGED THEMSELVES INTO WOLVES SNAKES AND TOADS
AND I SAW AN ANGEL COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN HAVING THE KEY OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND A GREAT CHAIN IN HIS HAND
VII
VII
VII
VII
VII
VII
IN MECHANICS THEY DETERMINED THE LAWS OF FALLING BODIES
JUSTICE NEVER HELD ALOFT THE SCALES
SUCH STORIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GAINED CREDENCE ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT THE SUPERNATURAL WAS EXPECTED
WHAT IDEA OF SUCCESS
I READ AND READ AGAIN WITH RAPTURE TEARS AND SMILES FEELING THAT A GREAT HEART WAS THROBBING IN THE LINES
AN OLD WOMAN SITTING BY THE FIRE AT NIGHT--A STORM RAGING WITHOUT--HEARS THE MOURNFUL SOUGH OF THE WIND
THE CAUSE WAS GOD
HE SENDS THE FLOOD AND THEY ARE DROWNED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I THINK FAR BETTER HAD THEY USED THIS MONEY TO BETTER THE CONDITION OF THE MEN WHO REALLY EARNED IT
AND YET TREASON FLOURISHED
1897 I
1897 I
THIS DEVIL IS THE ENEMY OF GOD AND GOD IS HIS
WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THERE CAN BE NO CHANGE THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY RELY ON THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE
HER MACHINERY SOON BECAME EQUAL TO 30,000,000 OF MEN
TO MAKE A SQUARE TRIANGLE WOULD BE A MOST WONDERFUL MIRACLE
IT HAS NO WILL NO PURPOSE
DO THE ACCOUNTS IN MATTHEW AND LUKE AGREE
THE DUNGEONS AGAINST WHOSE DRIPPING WALLS THE BRAVE AND GENEROUS HAVE SIGHED THEIR SOULS AWAY THE SCAFFOLDS STAINED AND GLORIFIED WITH NOBLE BLOOD THE HOPELESS SLAVES WITH SCARRED AND BLEEDING BACKS THE WRITHING MARTYRS CLOTHED IN FLAME THE VIRTUOUS STRETCHED ON RACKS THEIR JOINTS AND MUSCLES TORN APART THE FLAYED AND BLEEDING BODIES OF THE JUST THE EXTINGUISHED EYES OF THOSE WHO SOUGHT FOR TRUTH THE COUNTLESS PATRIOTS WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN VAIN THE BURDENED BEATEN WEEPING WIVES THE SHRIVELED FACES OF NEGLECTED BABES THE MURDERED MILLIONS OF THE VANISHED YEARS THE VICTIMS OF THE WINDS AND WAVES OF FLOOD AND FLAME OF IMPRISONED FORCES IN THE EARTH OF LIGHTNING'S STROKE OF LAVA'S MOLTEN STREAM OF FAMINE PLAGUE AND LINGERING PAIN THE MOUTHS THAT DRIP WITH BLOOD THE FANGS THAT POISON THE BEAKS THAT WOUND AND TEAR THE TRIUMPHS OF THE BASE THE RULE AND SWAY OF WRONG THE CROWNS THAT CRUELTY HAS WORN AND THE ROBED HYPOCRITES WITH CLASPED AND BLOODY HANDS WHO
WILL HE EVER BECOME CIVILIZED ENOUGH TO SAY
THE RESULT OF THIS CONVERSATION WAS THAT EVE ATE THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND INDUCED ADAM TO DO THE SAME
BUT YE HAVE MADE IT A DEN OF THIEVES WE KNOW WHAT WE WORSHIP FOR SALVATION IS OF THE JEWS CERTAINLY ALL THESE PASSAGES WERE WRITTEN BY PERSONS WHO REGARDED CHRIST AS THE MESSIAH
BOTH OF THESE DEITIES ARE INFERENCES
IF I FIND IN THE TESTAMENT SAYINGS OF A CONTRADICTORY CHARACTER I CONCLUDE THAT SOME OF THOSE SAYINGS WERE NEVER UTTERED BY HIM
MR PREACHER I HAVE NO FEAR OF THE FUTURE NO TERROR OF ANY OTHER WORLD
IF DEVILS DO NOT EXIST HELL BECOMES ONLY A DREAM OF REVENGE
MATTHEW SAYS THAT AT THE TIME OF THE CRUCIFIXION--"THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AND THAT MANY BODIES OF THE SAINTS WHICH SLEPT AROSE AND CAME OUT OF THEIR GRAVES AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND WENT INTO THE HOLY CITY AND APPEARED UNTO MANY ACCORDING TO THIS THE GRAVES WERE OPENED AT THE TIME OF THE CRUCIFIXION BUT THE DEAD DID NOT ARISE AND COME OUT UNTIL AFTER THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
IT WAS THE ENEMY OF COMMERCE--OF BUSINESS
THEY KNEW THAT THERE COULD BE NO SALVATION EXCEPT BY FAITH AND THROUGH THE ATONING BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST
WHAT DO WE THINK OF A MAN WHO WILL NOT WHEN HE HAS THE POWER PROTECT HIS FRIENDS
HE SHOULD EXAMINE
WE HAVE NO GOD TO SERVE OR FEAR NO HELL TO SHUN NO DEVIL WITH MALICIOUS LEER
IN ALL DIRECTIONS THEY SEEK FOR TRUTH AND WHEN FOUND ACCEPT IT WITH JOY--ACCEPT IT IN SPITE OF PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS--IN SPITE OF PREJUDICE AND HATRED
THEY ADMIT THEIR IGNORANCE AND THEY SAY WE DO NOT KNOW AFTER ALL WHY SHOULD WE WORSHIP OUR IGNORANCE WHY SHOULD WE KNEEL TO THE UNKNOWN WHY SHOULD WE PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE A GUESS
STRANGE AS IT IS I BELIEVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVED THEMSELVES GUILTY
THE MAKER WAS AND IS HERE
TO JUSTIFY THIS GOD WE MUST SAY THAT GOOD IS GOOD AND THAT EVIL IS ALSO GOOD
AND IN FIRST JOHN WE ARE TOLD THAT HE THAT COMMITTETH SIN IS OF THE DEVIL FOR THE REASON THAT THE DEVIL SINNETH FROM THE BEGINNING
SUPERSTITION IS THE SERPENT THAT CRAWLS AND HISSES IN EVERY EDEN AND FASTENS ITS POISONOUS FANGS IN THE HEARTS OF MEN
HE PRETENDED THAT IT WAS ALL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BIBLE
EVERY THOUGHT LEAVES ITS IMPRESS
SO HE WENT BACK AND DWELT IN NAZARETH
WE HAVE NO STANDARD
WOULD THE DUTCH HAVE BEEN MORE IDIOTIC IF THEY HAD DENIED THE FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST AND WORSHIPED THE BLESSED TRINITY OF SAUSAGE BEER AND CHEESE
THE MAN WHO FEARS TO THINK IS SUPERSTITION'S SLAVE
THERE IS DEVELOPMENT CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS GROWTH AND BY COMPARING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WE FIND THAT THE OLD HAS BEEN ALMOST ABANDONED ALMOST LOST IN THE NEW
ZACHARIAS WAS NOT THE SON OF BARACHIAS--NO SUCH ZACHARIAS WAS KILLED
IN THE NIGHT THOUGHTS THERE IS SCARCELY A GENUINELY HONEST NATURAL LINE
FEAR IS AN ARTIST--A SCULPTOR--A PAINTER
HE WAS DYING
BETWEEN PLACES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THE ROADS WERE LITTLE KNOWN AND A PRINCIPAL MODE OF TRANSPORT WAS BY PACK HORSES OF WHICH PASSENGERS TOOK ADVANTAGE BY STOWING THEMSELVES AWAY BETWEEN THE PACKS
THEY WERE NOT PHILOSOPHERS
THEY INSIST THAT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD HUSBANDS AND WIVES WHO LOATHE EACH OTHER SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO LIVE TOGETHER
HE GAVE US THE FACT AND DRAPER GAVE US THE REASON
IT IS NO LONGER A FOUNDATION
A REALLY CIVILIZED MAN A REALLY CIVILIZED WOMAN MUST HOLD SUCH A GOD IN ABHORRENCE AND CONTEMPT
HE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FORCES OF NATURE
NATURE WITH ONE HAND BUILDING WITH ONE HAND TEARING DOWN ARMED WITH SWORD AND SHIELD--SLAYING AND PROTECTING AND PROTECTING BUT TO SLAY
THAT THE LABORER MUST BE A FREE MAN THE THINKER MUST BE FREE
HE MUST DEFEND HIS CREED--HIS REVELATION
SUPERSTITION CREATED ALL THE GODS AND ANGELS ALL THE DEVILS AND GHOSTS ALL THE WITCHES DEMONS AND GOBLINS GAVE US ALL THE AUGURS SOOTHSAYERS AND PROPHETS FILLED THE HEAVENS WITH SIGNS AND WONDERS BROKE THE CHAIN OF CAUSE AND EFFECT AND WROTE THE HISTORY OF MAN IN MIRACLES AND LIES
THEY WERE DENOUNCED AS HAVING ONLY ONE IDEA BY MEN WHO HAD NONE
A MAN CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE NEW MOON OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND HE SAYS
WE DO NOT CREATE A MASTER AND THANKFULLY WEAR HIS CHAINS
THE FOUNDATION IS GONE
THE PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT HELL WAS THEIR NATIVE LAND
GOD AND HIS ANGELS INHABITED THE THIRD STORY THE DEVIL AND HIS IMPS THE BASEMENT AND THE HUMAN RACE THE SECOND FLOOR
SHOULD THE INFERIOR RACES THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPERIOR OR SHOULD THEY THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT BEASTS
HOLD THY PEACE AND COME OUT OF HIM AND THE DEVIL AFTER THROWING THE MAN DOWN CAME OUT
IN THOSE BLESSED DAYS THE PRIESTS KNEW ALL ABOUT HEAVEN AND HELL
14 1885
THE SOJOURN OF FORTY YEARS IN THE DESERT THE OPENING OF THE RED SEA THE CLOTHES AND SHOES THAT REFUSED TO WEAR OUT THE MANNA THE QUAILS AND THE SERPENTS THE WATER THAT RAN UP HILL THE TALKING OF JEHOVAH WITH MOSES FACE TO FACE THE GIVING OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THE OPENING OF THE EARTH TO SWALLOW THE ENEMIES OF MOSES--ALL MUST BE THROWN AWAY
TO LOVE JUSTICE TO LONG FOR THE RIGHT TO LOVE MERCY TO PITY THE SUFFERING TO ASSIST THE WEAK TO FORGET WRONGS AND REMEMBER BENEFITS--TO LOVE THE TRUTH TO BE SINCERE TO UTTER HONEST WORDS TO LOVE LIBERTY TO WAGE RELENTLESS WAR AGAINST SLAVERY IN ALL ITS FORMS TO LOVE WIFE AND CHILD AND FRIEND TO MAKE A HAPPY HOME TO LOVE THE BEAUTIFUL IN ART IN NATURE TO CULTIVATE THE MIND TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE MIGHTY THOUGHTS THAT GENIUS HAS EXPRESSED THE NOBLE DEEDS OF ALL THE WORLD TO CULTIVATE COURAGE AND CHEERFULNESS TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY TO FILL LIFE WITH THE SPLENDOR OF GENEROUS ACTS THE WARMTH OF LOVING WORDS TO DISCARD ERROR TO DESTROY PREJUDICE TO RECEIVE NEW TRUTHS WITH GLADNESS TO CULTIVATE HOPE TO SEE THE CALM BEYOND THE STORM THE DAWN BEYOND THE NIGHT TO DO THE BEST THAT CAN BE DONE AND THEN TO BE RESIGNED THIS IS THE RELIGION OF REASON THE CREED OF SCIENCE
MEN THINK AS THEY MUST
IN THOSE DAYS MINISTERS DEPENDED ON REVIVALS TO SAVE SOULS AND REFORM THE WORLD
OVERTURNING THE SALT IS VERY UNLUCKY BUT SPILLING THE VINEGAR MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
THAT THERE NEVER WILL BE ANY GENERAL JUDGMENT
BEYOND IMAGINATION'S UTMOST FLIGHT
THE HOLY GHOST PROCEEDED FROM THE FATHER AND SON BUT WAS EQUAL TO THE FATHER AND SON BEFORE HE PROCEEDED THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE HE EXISTED BUT HE IS OF THE SAME AGE OF THE OTHER TWO
COMPARED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE HOW EVERYTHING ELSE IN NATURE WOULD SHRINK AND SHRIVEL
NEWTON GAVE US THE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION OF THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION
THE EMPLOYER IS AT THE MERCY OF OTHER EMPLOYERS AND AS MUCH SO AS HIS EMPLOYEES ARE AT HIS MERCY
I DENY IT
I HAVE NOT SOUGHT DURING MY LIFE TO AMASS WEALTH AND TO ADORN MY BODY BUT I HAVE SOUGHT TO ADORN MY SOUL WITH THE JEWELS OF WISDOM PATIENCE AND ABOVE ALL WITH A LOVE OF LIBERTY SO I READ ABOUT DIOGENES THE PHILOSOPHER WHO HATED THE SUPERFLUOUS--THE ENEMY OF WASTE AND GREED AND WHO ONE DAY ENTERED THE TEMPLE REVERENTLY APPROACHED THE ALTAR CRUSHED A LOUSE BETWEEN THE NAILS OF HIS THUMBS AND SOLEMNLY SAID
HE NEITHER DECEIVES HIMSELF NOR OTHERS
BUT WE DO NOT FEEL THAT GOOD AND EVIL WERE PLANNED AND CAUSED BY A SUPERNATURAL GOD
AND FIRST OF ALL HE SHOULD AVOID WASTE--WASTE OF ENERGY WASTE OF WEALTH
WE BELIEVE IN THE NATURAL IN THE UNBROKEN AND UNBREAKABLE SUCCESSION OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS
IN ROME MEN WERE SOLD INTO BONDAGE IN ORDER TO PAY THEIR DEBTS
JEHOVAH--IV
THEN THE PEOPLE KILLED HIM AND AFTERWARD KNELT WITH REVERENCE AT HIS GRAVE
UNREASONING OBEDIENCE IS NOT THE FOUNDATION OR THE ESSENCE OF MORALITY
BUT IN 1580 GOROPIUS PUBLISHED HIS CELEBRATED WORK AT ANTWERP IN WHICH HE PUT THE WHOLE MATTER AT REST BY PROVING THAT THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN PARADISE WAS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN PLAIN HOLLAND DUTCH
ALL THE FACTS IN NATURE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AS THOUGH THE GLANCE HAD BEEN OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER
MATTER AND FORCE CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED OF TOGETHER
WE CANNOT CONCEIVE OF THE CREATION OF FORCE OR OF ITS DESTRUCTION
IT RELIES ON FEAR AND HOPE
BEHIND EACH VEIL REMOVED ANOTHER
LET EACH HUMAN BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE BE SELF-SUPPORTING
THEY HAVE LIVED UPON THEIR HOPES AND FEARS
THE CONVICTS SHOULD BE EDUCATED
I HEAR THEIR PRAYERS THEIR SIGHS THEIR SOBS
TEACH THEM THAT NO CIVILIZED MAN WANTS ANYTHING FOR NOTHING OR FOR LESS THAN IT IS WORTH
IF HAPPINESS HAVE NOT HER SEAT AND CENTER IN THE BREAST WE MAY BE WISE OR RICH OR GREAT BUT NEVER CAN BE BLEST WE MUST TEACH THIS AND LET OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS KNOW THAT WE GIVE THEM EVERY RIGHT THAT WE CLAIM FOR OURSELVES
ADMIRATION CANNOT BE CONTROLLED
STILL I WOULD RATHER APPEAR AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT DRUNK AND BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAS THE AUTHOR OF A MAN'S A MAN FOR A THAT THAN TO BE PERFECTLY SOBER AND ADMIT THAT I HAD LIVED AND DIED A SCOTCH PRESBYTERIAN
DOES NATURE CARE FOR US MORE THAN FOR LEAVES OR GRASS OR FLIES
SO PRISONERS SHOULD WORK AND THEY SHOULD BE PAID A REASONABLE SUM FOR THEIR LABOR
WE WERE JUST MARRIED
AND SO MILLIONS OF MEN GIVE ALL THEIR ENERGIES AS WELL AS THEIR VERY SOULS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF GOLD
IN CHEMISTRY THE WAR WAS LONG AND BITTER
THEY HAVE COAXED AND PERSUADED
IF MEN WERE ALLOWED TO THINK AND EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS THEY WOULD FILL THEIR MINDS AND THE MINDS OF OTHERS WITH DOUBTS
IF GOD DID THIS AND KNEW THE BLOOD THAT WOULD BE SHED THE AGONIES THAT WOULD BE ENDURED SAW THE COUNTLESS FIELDS COVERED WITH THE CORPSES OF THE SLAIN SAW ALL THE BLEEDING BACKS OF SLAVES ALL THE BROKEN HEARTS OF MOTHERS BEREFT OF BABES IF HE SAW AND KNEW ALL THIS CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A MORE MALICIOUS FIEND
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH ONE MIRACLE EXCEPT BY ANOTHER--AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED BY ANOTHER STILL AND SO ON WITHOUT END
HE THEN CREATES A FORCE SO TO SPEAK BY CHANGING WATER TO STEAM AND WITH THAT HE IMPELS MACHINES THAT CAN DO ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT THINK
HE WATCHES THESE PUPPETS AS THEY STRUGGLE AND FAIL
IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
HE BECOMES THE KEY TO A SAFE
THEY NOT ONLY KNEW THE BEGINNING BUT THEY KNEW THE END
HOW DO I KNOW
THEY CANNOT CONTROL SUPPLY
BUT REAL MORALITY IS THE FLOWER AND FRUIT OF LIBERTY AND WISDOM
ALL THIS THE MINISTERS REALLY BELIEVED
IF HE HAD KNOWN THESE FACTS WOULD HE HAVE SAID THAT JEHOVAH WORKED NEARLY SIX DAYS TO MAKE THIS WORLD AND ONLY A PART OF THE AFTERNOON OF THE FOURTH DAY TO MAKE THE SUN AND MOON AND ALL THE STARS
AGAIN I SAY THAT NO SENSIBLE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD BELIEVES IN DEVILS
BECAUSE IT IS NOT TO OUR INTEREST TO HAVE A FEW LANDLORDS AND MILLIONS OF TENANTS
HE COULD TAKE HIS CHOICE BETWEEN KILLING AND LYING
THE WRETCHES WHO WERE MURDERED WERE IDOLATERS AND THEREFORE UNFIT TO LIVE
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS HAVE BELIEVED IN SERAPHIM AND CHERUBIM
THEY CARE NOTHING FOR WHAT A MAN CALLS FACTS FACTS THAT DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE BOOKS ARE MISTAKES
THEY DID NOT WOUND--THEY HEALED
HE KNOWS THAT HE WORKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CERTAIN FACTS THAT NO POWER CAN CHANGE
HE MUST BE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE TO ACCEPT WITHOUT QUESTION
DOWN COMES THE CLUB AND THE MAN OF STRAW DEMANDS AN EXPLANATION--A RETRACTION
THEY WERE LIKE THE OLD MAN WHO SAID THAT HE SAW A GRINDSTONE FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY GOD WHO CAN BE PLEASED WITH INCENSE WITH KNEELING WITH BELL-RINGING PSALM-SINGING BEAD-COUNTING FASTING OR PRAYER--IN ANY GOD WHO CAN BE FLATTERED BY WORDS OF FAITH OR FEAR
IT IS ADMITTED BY ALL THAT HAPPINESS IS THE ONLY GOOD HAPPINESS IN ITS HIGHEST AND GRANDEST SENSE AND THE MOST SPRINGS OF REFINED GENEROUS CONSCIENCE TENDS INDIRECTLY TRULY WE PHYSICALLY TO DEVELOP THE WONDERFUL POWERS OF THE MIND IS PROGRESS
THAT MONEY WILL GET HIM UP AT DAYLIGHT
THEY ARE ASHAMED OF THE LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
NOW IN A MUCH MORE CROWDED POPULATION THEY ARE NOT ONE IN FORTY
THERE IS STILL ANOTHER MISTAKE
THAT CHRIST ESTABLISHED A CHURCH
THAT IS ENOUGH
YOU ARE FREE TO DECIDE
THEY HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE MIRACULOUS IN THE SUPERNATURAL AND THEY HAVE CEASED TO TAKE INTEREST IN FACTS THAT THEY DO NOT QUITE BELIEVE
KNEW THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR FAILURE
WE DO NOT PRAY OR WEEP OR WAIL
THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THEM IN OLD AGE
IF THEY WOULD FOREGO THE THRILL AND BLISS OF MEANNESS HERE THEY WOULD BE REWARDED HEREAFTER FOR THAT SELF-DENIAL
WE HAVE FAITH IN FACTS--IN KNOWLEDGE--IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN
SUPERSTITION IS ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND FOREVER WILL BE THE FOE OF PROGRESS THE ENEMY OF EDUCATION AND THE ASSASSIN OF FREEDOM
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVIL IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN MADE THE COMING OF CHRIST A NECESSITY LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ATONEMENT CRUCIFIED THE SAVIOR AND GAVE US THE TRINITY
BOTH OF THESE GENEALOGIES CANNOT BE TRUE AND THE PROBABILITY IS THAT BOTH ARE FALSE
LET ME TELL THE ORTHODOX MINISTERS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO COVER THEIR RETREAT
THE GOD OF THE CHRISTIAN IS AN ENTHRONED GUESS--A PERHAPS--AN INFERENCE
I AM NOT BLAMING ANYBODY
THE HISTORY OF THESE GODS IS THE EXACT HISTORY OF OUR CHRIST
TAKE THE DEVIL FROM THE DRAMA OF CHRISTIANITY AND THE PLOT IS GONE--JESUS TEMPTED BY THE EVIL ONE--DEMONIAC POSSESSION--MARY MAGDALENE--SATAN AND JUDAS--INCUBI AND SUCCUBI--THE APOSTLES BELIEVED IN MIRACLES AND MAGIC--THE POOL OF BETHESDA--IV
I THANK ERICSSON THE GREATEST MECHANIC OF HIS CENTURY FOR THE MONITOR
HE WILL DESTROY THE SERPENTS OF FEAR THE MONSTERS OF SUPERSTITION
IT WAS NO USE TO ORDER HIM OUT BECAUSE HE COULD NOT HEAR
WE KNOW THE SOULS THEY HAVE SAVED AND THE BODIES THEY HAVE DESTROYED
THESE GREAT THEORIES AND DISCOVERIES TOGETHER WITH COUNTLESS INVENTIONS ARE THE CHILDREN OF INTELLECTUAL LIBERTY
BUT WE HAD COWPER'S POEMS
THERE MUST COME A CHANGE OR CHRISTENDOM WILL BECOME BANKRUPT
THEY COULD GET CREDIT--THEY DID NOT HAVE TO PAY TILL THE NEXT JANUARY AND IF THEY COULD NOT PAY THEN THEY TOOK ANOTHER YEAR AND THEY WERE HAPPY ENOUGH
HE HAS MUTILATED HIS BODY--SCARRED HIS FLESH--GIVEN HIS BLOOD TO VERMIN
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE FACT OF EVAPORATION--DID NOT KNOW THAT THE RAIN CAME FROM THE WATER ON THE EARTH
BUT IF A MAN LACKS FAITH THE SCHEME IS EXACTLY REVERSED
WHERE ARE THEIR SOULS IN THE MEANTIME
NOW NO MAN IN WHOSE BRAIN THE TORCH OF REASON BUMS NO MAN WHO INVESTIGATES WHO REALLY THINKS WHO IS CAPABLE OF WEIGHING EVIDENCE BELIEVES IN SIGNS IN LUCKY OR UNLUCKY DAYS IN LUCKY OR UNLUCKY NUMBERS
IN GRIEF AS IN JOY
TO USE A WESTERN PHRASE OR SAYING I FOUND THAT BISHOP BUTLER DUG UP MORE SNAKES THAN HE KILLED--SUGGESTED MORE DIFFICULTIES THAN HE EXPLAINED--MORE DOUBTS THAN HE DISPELLED
TO RELIEVE SUFFERING TO PUT THE STAR OF HOPE IN THE MIDNIGHT OF DESPAIR THIS IS TRUE HOLINESS
THE RELIGION KNOWN AS CHRISTIANITY WAS INVENTED BY GOD HIMSELF TO REPAIR IN PART THE WRECK AND RUIN THAT HAD RESULTED FROM THE DEVIL'S WORK
THE ATMOSPHERE THEY BREATHED WAS FILLED WITH LIES--LIES THAT MINGLED WITH THEIR BLOOD
THESE DEAR MINISTERS WHEN THEY HAVE POOR CONGREGATIONS THUNDER AGAINST TRUSTS SYNDICATES AND CORPORATIONS--AGAINST WEALTH FASHION AND LUXURY
IT WAS ALSO BELIEVED THAT IF THE SACRIFICES WERE NOT MADE THIS GOD SENT PESTILENCE FAMINE FLOOD AND EARTHQUAKE
BEING SATISFIED THAT THE SUPERNATURAL DOES NOT EXIST MAN SHOULD TURN HIS ENTIRE ATTENTION TO THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD TO THE FACTS IN NATURE
THIS IS THE ONLY HONEST DEFINITION OF A MIRACLE
AND I WOULD DO THIS NOT ONLY FOR HER SAKE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE COMMUNITY OF THE NATION
THEY TRACED THE ORDER OF ST MICHAEL IN FRANCE BACK TO THE ARCHANGEL HIMSELF AND ALLEGED THAT HE WAS THE FOUNDER OF A CHIVALRIC ORDER IN HEAVEN ITSELF
IN THIS HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE AS WATSON SAID IN HIS REPLY TO PAINE THE GOD OF NATURE IS AS HEARTLESS AS CRUEL AS THE GOD OF THE BIBLE
WE WILL READ IT FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BELIEVE WHAT WE SAY
ARE THEY A PERSONIFICATION
THEY OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEIR BELIEF IN HELL GIVES TO THE HOLY GHOST--THE DOVE--THE BEAK OF A VULTURE AND FILLS THE MOUTH OF THE LAMB OF GOD WITH THE FANGS OF A VIPER
SO IN EPHESIANS WE ARE WARNED NOT TO GIVE PLACE TO THE DEVIL AND IN THE SAME BOOK WE ARE TOLD
THAT HE EVER HEARD OR ANSWERED ANY PRAYER
THEY DO THE LABOR OF THIS WORLD
THE ANCIENT SAGES OF EGYPT HAD A VOCABULARY ACCORDING TO BUNSEN OF ONLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE WORDS EXCLUSIVE OF PROPER NAMES
WITH THIS BOOK THEY BANISHED PITY FROM THE HEART SUBVERTED ALL IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS IMPRISONED THE SOUL IN THE DUNGEON OF FEAR AND MADE HONEST DOUBT A CRIME
THE GREAT DOME RESTS ON AIR
THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MUST BE UNCREATEABLE
ALL THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS LIFE WERE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE DEVIL
THEY HAVE ERECTED A MONUMENT TO ENLIGHTENED CHARITY TO WHICH TIME CAN ADD ONLY GRANDEUR
THEY KNEW THAT IN THE ETERNITY--BACK OF THAT MORNING HE HAD DONE NOTHING
THEY FEEL THE KISSES ON THEIR EAGER LIPS
AND HE NOT ONLY KNEW THAT BUT HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SCHEME OF SALVATION
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT NO NECESSITY OF BREAD OR ROOF OR RAIMENT SHALL EVER PUT A PADLOCK ON MY LIPS
THE TRIUMPHS OF SCIENCE ARE OUR MIRACLES
THIS KIND OF RELIGION HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY UNIVERSAL
THE TRINITY--THE INCARNATION--WAS CHRIST GOD?--THE TRINITY EXPOUNDED--"LET US PRAY"--V
IT FILLS THEM WITH MALICE TO SEE THE PEOPLE HAPPY ON THAT DAY
THERE WERE COMPLETE SUITS OF ARMOR ON BACKS THAT HAD NEVER FELT A SHIRT
THE OLD MAN BOWED AND BROKEN COULD GET BACK HIS YOUTH--THE ROUNDED FORM THE BROWN HAIR THE LEAPING HEART OF LIFE'S MORNING--IF HE WOULD SIGN AND SEAL AWAY HIS SOUL
BUT THIS IS NOT ALL
BUT THIS IS NOT ALL
THAT BY INVENTION AND INDUSTRY WE CAN SUPPLY TO A REASONABLE DEGREE THE WANTS OF THE BODY AND BY THOUGHT STUDY AND EFFORT WE CAN IN PART SATISFY THE HUNGER OF THE MIND
THIS TRUTH WAS ALWAYS KNOWN AND FOR THAT REASON SLAVES HAVE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO READ
EVERY PREACHER WHO TEACHES IT IS AN ENEMY OF MANKIND
INNUMERABLE AGENCIES WERE AT WORK DISPELLING DARKNESS AND CREATING LIGHT
THEN CAME NEWTON HERSCHELAND LAPLACE
TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IT PROMISES THE ENDLESS ECSTASIES OF HEAVEN
THE CHURCH TEACHES THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
SO THIS IDEA OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS ONLY FOR THEIR SAKE IS ABSURD
WHAT ARE THE ORTHODOX CLERGY DOING FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND
AUSTRIA IS NEARLY GONE A VICTIM OF SUPERSTITION
THIS WORLD WAS A FIELD OF BATTLE AND HERE THE HOSTS OF HEAVEN AND HELL WAGED WAR
TO CIVILIZE THE PEOPLE HE HAD CHOSEN HE ASSISTED THEM IN CONQUERING AND KILLING THEIR NEIGHBORS AND GAVE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF PRIESTS AND INSPIRED PROPHETS
THE DECLARATION THAT SALVATION IS THE REWARD FOR BELIEF IS INCONSISTENT WITH MENTAL FREEDOM AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE BY NO MAN WHO THOUGHT THAT EVIDENCE SUSTAINED THE SLIGHTEST RELATION TO BELIEF
WE KNOW THAT ALL SUPERSTITIONS ALL CREEDS ALL FOLLIES AND MISTAKES ALL CRIMES AND CRUELTIES ALL VIRTUES VICES HOPES AND FEARS ALL DISCOVERIES AND INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
ANIMALS USE THE WEAPONS NATURE HAS FURNISHED AND THOSE ONLY--THE BEAK THE CLAW THE TUSK THE TEETH
BEYOND THIS IDIOCY CANNOT GO
WE KNOW THAT THEY TAUGHT THE BLESSED ABSURDITY OF THE TRINITY--THAT GOD ONCE WORKED AT THE TRADE OF A CARPENTER IN PALESTINE
AWAY FROM THE SLAVES OF SUPERSTITION
THESE UNWELCOME CHILDREN FILL THE JAILS AND PRISONS THE ASYLUMS AND HOSPITALS AND THEY CROWD THE SCAFFOLDS
THEY SAY:--"READ AND THEN ADD
I DO NOT KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW
I DO NOT KNOW
THIS IS FREEDOM
CONSCIENTIOUS GOOD SINCERE--INSANE
IT IS AS HEARTLESS AS HIDEOUS AS HELLISH AS THE THIRTY-SECOND CHAPTER OF DEUTERONOMY
BUT I WOULD THINK MORE OF ANY RELIGION PROVIDED THAT EVEN FOR ONE DAY IN THE WEEK OR FOR ONE HOUR IN THE YEAR IT ALLOWED WEALTH TO CLASP THE HAND OF POVERTY AND TO HAVE FOR ONE MOMENT EVEN THE THRILL OF GENUINE FRIENDSHIP
SO MORALITY AND RELIGION MUST FIND THEIR FOUNDATIONS IN THE NECESSARY NATURE OF THINGS
WHY IS IT THAT MANY SPECIES OF SERPENTS HAVE NO FANGS
NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED ALTARS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN BUT OPINIONS CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS REMAINED THE SAME
ART THOU COME HITHER TO TORMENT US BEFORE THE TIME IF THESE WERE SIMPLY PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL HOW DID THEY KNOW THAT JESUS WAS THE SON OF GOD AND HOW CAN A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL BE TORMENTED
ALL THE SAINTS WON THEIR CROWNS BY OVERCOMING DEVILS
AMONG SUCH BOOKS MY YOUTH WAS PASSED
HE COULD NOT BY ANY POSSIBILITY HAVE KNOWN THAT THE BLOOD OF ZACHARIAS HAD BEEN SHED
HE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF YOUNG
ALL OF HIS ASSOCIATES WERE PERFECT
THIS BEING SO WE OUGHT TO HAVE TWO SUNDAYS A WEEK
THAT HE FOREVER HAS BEEN AND FOREVER WILL BE INFINITE WISE AND GOOD
CAN WE INFER THE GOODNESS OF GOD FROM THE FACTS WE KNOW
THE ATLAS OF CHRISTIANITY IS THE DEVIL--THE DEVIL OF THE OLD TESTAMENT--THE SERPENT IN EDEN--"PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL--SATAN AND JOB--SATAN AND DAVID--III
I HAD RATHER BE POOR WITH A LITTLE SYMPATHY IN MY HEART THAN TO BE RICH AS ALL THE MINES OF EARTH AND NOT HAVE THAT LITTLE FLOWER OF PITY IN MY BREAST
CAN ANYTHING BE SACRED TO US THAT WE DO NOT KNOW TO BE TRUE
HOLD THY PEACE AND COME OUT OF HIM AND WHEN THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT HAD TORN HIM AND CRIED WITH A LOUD VOICE HE CAME OUT OF HIM
LET THERE BE A FIRMAMENT IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS AND LET IT DIVIDE THE WATERS FROM THE WATERS
AT THE SAME TIME THEY DO NOT WANT CHILDREN BECAUSE A CHILD IS A CURSE A CURSE TO THEM AND TO ITSELF
THE GARDEN OF EDEN FADED AWAY ADAM AND EVE FELL BACK TO DUST THE SNAKE CRAWLED INTO THE GRASS AND JEHOVAH BECAME A MISERABLE MYTH
THEY ARE NOT INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT CONSEQUENCES OR TO FEEL RESPONSIBILITY
IF THE BIBLE WAS DIVINELY INSPIRED IF IT WAS THE ACTUAL WORD OF GOD WE HAVE NO AUTHENTICATED COPY
THESE POOR WRETCHES WERE THE SLAVES OF FEAR THE SPORT OF DREAMS
BETTER ETERNAL SLEEP
IF THESE MACHINES HELPED THE LABORER WHAT A BLESSING THEY WOULD BE
MAN HAS LENGTHENED HIS ARMS
CERTAINLY THE INSPIRED WRITERS OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO JUDAS THE BETRAYER
HOW CONSOLING IT IS TO THINK THAT THE FRIENDS OF SCIENCE--THE MEN WHO EDUCATED THEIR FELLOWS--ARE NOW IN HELL AND THAT THE MEN WHO PERSECUTED AND KILLED PHILOSOPHERS ARE NOW IN HEAVEN
ONE MAN COULD NOT PROFIT BY THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER
IN ANSWER THE INTELLIGENT HONEST MAN MUST SAY
THEY BEGAN TO REALLY SEE AND THEN THEY BEGAN TO REASON
JESUS SAID TO THIS DEVIL
THE FAIRY CALLED THE SUPERNATURAL TOUCHES WITH HER WAND A FACT IT DISAPPEARS
THE DATE OF HIS RETURN IS NOT GIVEN
MAN HAD NO RIGHT TO CURE DISEASE--GOD WOULD DO THAT THROUGH HIS PRIESTS
FOR MANY CENTURIES THIS GREAT PEASANT OF PALESTINE HAS BEEN WORSHIPED AS GOD
THEN THERE WAS A COPY OR RATHER A TRANSLATION CALLED THE SEPTUAGINT
THAT COUNTRY HAS BEEN COVERED WITH NUNNERIES MONASTERIES CATHEDRALS AND TEMPLES--FILLED WITH ALL VARIETIES OF PRIESTS AND HOLY MEN
I WISH THAT I HAD BEEN A DOG WELL WHILE THE COLD WEATHER LASTED WHILE THE SNOWS FELL THE REVIVAL WENT ON BUT WHEN THE WINTER WAS OVER WHEN THE STEAMBOAT'S WHISTLE WAS HEARD WHEN BUSINESS STARTED AGAIN MOST OF THE CONVERTS BACKSLID AND FELL AGAIN INTO THEIR OLD WAYS
THEY HAVE PREACHED AND PRAYED
THIS GOD WITHHELD THE RAIN--CAUSED THE FAMINE--SAW THE FIERCE EYES OF HUNGER--THE WASTED FORMS THE WHITE LIPS SAW MOTHERS EATING BABES AND REMAINED FEROCIOUS AS FAMINE
ALL THE METAPHYSICIANS OF THE SPIRITUAL TYPE FROM PLATO TO SWEDENBORG HAVE MANUFACTURED THEIR FACTS AND ALL FOUNDERS OF RELIGION HAVE DONE THE SAME
IF POSSIBLE HE MUST CONQUER PAIN INCREASE HAPPINESS AND LENGTHEN LIFE
WILLIAM KINGDON CLIFFORD ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN OF THIS CENTURY SAID
THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE USE OF TOOLS TO USE THEIR HANDS TO EMBODY THEIR THOUGHTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THINGS
THE WHEEL AND SWOOP OF THE WINGED CREATURES OF THE AIR SUGGEST THE FLOWING LINES OF SUBTLE ART
WE NOW BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND WE DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
THAT HE PROTECTS THE GOOD OR PUNISHES THE WICKED
THEY BELIEVE IN THE MIRACLES OF THE PAST AND DENY THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE PRESENT
IS THERE A GOD
IS THERE A GOD
GO YE AND TELL THAT FOX BEHOLD I CAST OUT DEVILS WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THIS
EARTHQUAKES AND CYCLONES FILLED THE COFFERS OF THE CHURCH
ALL THE WRITERS HAVING BEEN INSPIRED DID NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS
THAT THE DESIRE TO ACQUIRE GREAT WEALTH IS A KIND OF INSANITY
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE THE FIRST MAN WAS CREATED FOUR THOUSAND AND FOUR YEARS BEFORE CHRIST IF THIS IS TRUE THEN EGYPT WAS FOUNDED ITS LANGUAGE FORMED ITS ARTS CULTIVATED ITS ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES MADE AND RECORDED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE CREATION OF THE FIRST MAN
I THANK THE FOUNDERS THE DEFENDERS THE SAVIORS OF THE REPUBLIC
IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER IS TOLD AGAIN THE STORY OF THE DEVILS AND THE SWINE
IN MEDICINE HE BELIEVED IN CHARMS MAGIC AMULETS AND INCANTATIONS
BE JUST BECAUSE ANY OTHER COURSE IS THE SUICIDE OF THE SOUL
HIS REVENGE WAS SATISFIED WHEN HIS ENEMY WAS DEAD
SHALL WE THANK THESE GODS
HE HAS IT
CAN WE SAY THAT IN THE HEART OF THIS GOD THERE BLOSSOMED THE FLOWER OF PITY
HE MUST BORROW IT--THAT IS TO SAY HE MUST EAT
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO IN CIVILIZED COUNTRIES LARCENY AND MANY OFFENCES EVEN BELOW LARCENY WERE PUNISHED BY DEATH
HE IS TOLD THAT THIS GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF THE BIBLE--THAT CHRIST IS HIS SON
I BELIEVE THAT THE NATURAL IS SUPREME--THAT FROM THE INFINITE CHAIN NO LINK CAN BE LOST OR BROKEN--THAT THERE IS NO SUPERNATURAL POWER THAT CAN ANSWER PRAYER--NO POWER THAT WORSHIP CAN PERSUADE OR CHANGE--NO POWER THAT CARES FOR MAN
THE DISCIPLES HAD TRIED TO CURE HIM AND HAD FAILED
DID HE PUT IN DIFFERENT MEDICINES FOR DIFFERENT DISEASES OR DID HE HAVE A MEDICINE LIKE THOSE THAT ARE PATENTED NOW THAT CURED ALL DISEASES JUST THE SAME
THEY SAY THAT MOTHER'S RELIGION IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM
OUR LIVES ARE IN THEIR HANDS ALMOST EVERY DAY
EVERY BRAIN IS A FIELD WHERE NATURE SOWS THE SEEDS OF THOUGHT AND THE CROP DEPENDS UPON THE SOIL
HOW CAN THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN EXPLAIN THESE THINGS
ANOTHER WASTE--VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON THE CHURCH--IV
THE GOLD AND LABOR OF MEN WERE WASTED IN BUILDING CATHEDRALS AND IN SUPPORTING THE PIOUS AND THE USELESS
ALL THIS SO FAR AS WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE
WE CAN TELL THE TRUTH AND WE CAN ENJOY THE BLESSED FREEDOM THAT THE BRAVE HAVE WON
THEY LOVE THE TRUTH
TO THEM SCIENCE WAS THE NAME OF A VAGUE DREAD--A DANGEROUS ENEMY
BEWARE OF THE DOG"--"PREPARE FOR DEATH THIS FACE LIKE THE FABLED GORGON TURNS CHEERFULNESS TO STONE
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
MOST PEOPLE LOVE PEACE
IN THE UNIVERSE THERE IS NO CHANCE NO CAPRICE
IF MATTHEW AND LUKE ARE BOTH RIGHT CHRIST WAS TAKEN TO EGYPT TEN YEARS BEFORE HE WAS BORN AND HEROD KILLED THE BABES TEN YEARS AFTER HE WAS DEAD
THE MINISTERS PRETEND THAT THEY HAVE ADVANCED--THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THE THINGS THAT I ATTACK
THE CHRISTIANS DO NOT KNOW
THE SAME CAUSES THAT LED TO THE LIBERATION OF MIND ALSO LIBERATED THE BODY
W|E HAD THE HISTORY OF THE WALDENSES--OF THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH
THE SAME MISTAKE THE SAME SUPERSTITION BENDS THE KNEES AND SHUTS THE EYES OF BOTH
EVERY HUMAN BEING LONGS TO BE HAPPY TO SATISFY THE WANTS OF THE BODY WITH FOOD WITH ROOF AND RAIMENT AND TO FEED THE HUNGER OF THE MIND ACCORDING TO HIS CAPACITY WITH LOVE WISDOM PHILOSOPHY ART AND SONG
IN THE NEXT CENTURY IT BECAME A POWER AND IT HAS BEEN FLOODING THE WORLD WITH LIGHT FROM THAT TIME TO THIS
THE PRISONER WAS THEN COMPELLED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH ANIMAL TO MAKE A SOLEMN DECLARATION OF HIS INNOCENCE AND IF THE ANIMAL FAILED TO CONTRADICT HIM HE WAS DECLARED GUILTLESS,--THE LAW TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DEITY WOULD CAUSE A MIRACULOUS MANIFESTATION BY A DUMB ANIMAL RATHER THAN ALLOW A MURDERER TO ESCAPE
THEY WANT NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
PROTECT THEM FROM THIS INFINITE LIE
WHAT USEFUL TRUTH DID THEY DISCOVER
THE IRISH ARE CATHOLICS BECAUSE THEIR FATHERS WERE
THEY MADE THE BEST CALCULATIONS THEY COULD OF THE TIME REQUIRED TO MAKE THE COAL AND CONCLUDED THAT IT MUST HAVE TAKEN AT LEAST SIX OR SEVEN MILLIONS OF YEARS
IN TIMES OF DANGER THEY WERE THROWN INTO THE SEA
WHAT FOR
HER PRAYERS ARE NEVER ANSWERED BUT SHE MAKES THEM STILL
GEOLOGISTS SAY THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THESE ANIMALS CEASED TO INHABIT THOSE COUNTRIES
IT IS WRITTEN MY HOUSE IS THE HOUSE OF PRAYER
DID HE ALLOW HIS ENEMIES TO TORTURE AND BURN HIS FRIENDS
POSSIBLY CLAY AND SPITTLE BROUGHT BACK THE LIGHT TO SIGHTLESS EYES AND POSSIBLY WORDS CURED DISEASE AND MADE THE LEPER CLEAN BUT OF THIS WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD TOO THAT THEY CAN REFORM
IT SHOULD APPEAL NOT TO PASSION NOT TO HOPE AND FEAR BUT TO THE JUDGMENT
IF NOBODY HAS TOO MUCH EVERYBODY WILL HAVE ENOUGH
AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH HIM
THE WANDERERS HOPE FOR HOME.--HOPE BUILDS THE HOUSE AND PLANTS THE FLOWERS AND FILLS THE AIR WITH SONG
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE AN AMERICAN AIR-BOTTLING ASSOCIATION
EVERY SERMON IN WHICH MEN HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY COULD SAVE THEIR SOULS BY BELIEVING HAS BEEN AN INJURY
TO ACCOUNT FOR ONE MYSTERY BY ANOTHER
HIS BLOOD GROWS COLD HIS HAIR LIFTS
IN HIS NAME THE THINKERS THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN BRANDED AS CRIMINALS AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAVE SHED THE BLOOD OF THE WISEST AND BEST
MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE WORKINGMEN OF THE UNITED STATES
THE BIRTHS OF NEARLY ALL WERE ANNOUNCED BY STARS CELEBRATED BY CELESTIAL MUSIC AND VOICES DECLARED THAT A BLESSING HAD COME TO THE POOR WORLD
BY VIRTUE OF THE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS WARS OF EUROPE SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ONE OF THE GRANDEST PAGES IN ALL HISTORY WAS SO TO SPEAK THE EXTERMINATOR OF WHITE SLAVERY
WHY SHOULD I FEAR THAT WHICH CANNOT EXIST WHEN I DO I READ ABOUT SOCRATES WHO WHEN ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS TO HIS JUDGES THESE WONDROUS WORDS
WHY DID THE GOD WHO MADE THEM MAKE ENEMIES
MY ATTENTION WAS TURNED TO OTHER RELIGIONS TO THE SACRED BOOKS THE CREEDS AND CEREMONIES OF OTHER LANDS--OF INDIA EGYPT ASSYRIA PERSIA OF THE DEAD AND DYING NATIONS
GRANT--VOLTAIRE HUMBOLDT DARWIN
THEY FILLED THE AIR WITH THE RUINS OF TEMPLES AND THRONES AND WITH BLOODY HANDS TORE IN PIECES THE ALTAR UPON WHICH THEIR RIGHTS HAD BEEN OFFERED BY AN IMPIOUS CHURCH
ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT THERE IS NOTHING TOO SACRED TO BE INVESTIGATED--TOO HOLY TO BE UNDERSTOOD
THE COMMON PEOPLE HAD ONLY TO DO THE WORK THE FIGHTING AND TO PAY THE TAXES AS BY THE LAW THE PROPERTY OF THE NOBLES WAS EXEMPT FROM TAXATION
HE MAY HAVE BEEN A KING OR SERF--A PHILOSOPHER OR SERVANT,--BUT THE UTTERANCE NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES IN TRUTH OR REASON
THE CHIEF PRIESTS THEN TOOK THE PIECES OF SILVER AND BOUGHT THE POTTER'S FIELD TO BURY STRANGERS IN AND IT IS CALLED THE FIELD OF BLOOD
DOES NATURE KNOW THAT WE EXIST
IF MATTER AND FORCE HAVE EXISTED FROM ETERNITY IT THEN FOLLOWS THAT ALL THAT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE HAS HAPPENED ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE IS HAPPENING AND ALL THAT WILL BE POSSIBLE WILL HAPPEN
THEY MUST THROW AWAY THE APPLE THE FALL OF MAN THE EXPULSION AND THE GATE GUARDED BY ANGELS ARMED WITH SWORDS
THESE ARE SOME OF THE RESULTS OF FREE THOUGHT AND FREE LABOR
IS DEATH A DOOR THAT LEADS TO LIGHT
THE NEXT TIME HE GOES TO THE SAME PLACE HE DOES NOT TAKE THE LEFT HAND ROAD
THE DEVIL WAS FORCED TO FATHER THE FAILURES OF GOD
WHEN HE WILL BE REALLY ANXIOUS TO PAY THE LABORER THE FULL VALUE OF HIS LABOR
THE MEN WHO FELLED THE FORESTS CULTIVATED THE EARTH SPANNED THE RIVERS WITH BRIDGES OF STEEL BUILT THE RAILWAYS AND CANALS THE GREAT SHIPS INVENTED THE LOCOMOTIVES AND ENGINES SUPPLYING THE COUNTLESS WANTS OF MAN
THEY HAVE INVENTED WAYS TO USE THE FORCES OF THE WORLD THE WEIGHT OF FALLING WATER--OF MOVING AIR
THE LOCOMOTIVE WAS GIVEN TO MANKIND BY STEPHENSON
I SEE THE NATIONS AS THEY FADE AND FAIL
CONSEQUENTLY THERE COULD NOT BY ANY POSSIBILITY HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY FORCE BACK OF MATTER
WHEN A MURDER IS COMMITTED THE MAN IS HANGED SHOCKED TO DEATH BY ELECTRICITY OR LYNCHED AND IN A FEW MINUTES A NEW MURDERER IS READY TO SUFFER A LIKE FATE
AT THE SAME TIME CHRIST SAID
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE NOW KNOW THAT THE BONE OF A SAINT HAS IN IT NO GREATER VIRTUE THAN THE BONE OF ANY ANIMAL
THE SICK AND SUFFERING HOPE FOR HEALTH.--HOPE GIVES THEM HEALTH AND PAINTS THE ROSES IN THEIR CHEEKS
BUT SAID THE GENTLEMAN MY CHILDREN ARE BOTH MARRIED AND LIVE IN IOWA THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE SAID THE JANITOR I AM NOT ALLOWED TO RENT A FLAT TO ANY MAN WHO HAS CHILDREN ALL THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES ARE OBSTRUCTIONS ON THE HIGHWAY OF PROGRESS
THEY HAD CONFIDENCE IN REASON
THE INFINITE MUST DWELL IN ETERNAL CALM
THEY SEEK BY NATURAL MEANS TO CONQUER AND USE THE FORCES OF NATURE
I HAVE BARELY ALLUDED TO A FEW--WHERE IS IMPROVEMENT TO STOP
LET SATAN STAND AT HIS RIGHT HAND III
JUST BREATHING FREE AIR WATCHING THE HOLLYHOCKS LISTENING TO THE BIRDS AND TO THE MUSIC OF THE SPRING THAT COMES LIKE A POEM FROM THE EARTH
IF WE GIVE UP THE BELIEF IN DEVILS AND EVIL SPIRITS WE ARE COMPELLED TO SAY THAT A WITCH NEVER LIVED
WE BELIEVE IN HOME AND FIRESIDE--IN WIFE AND CHILD AND FRIEND--IN THE REALITIES OF THIS WORLD
WHAT CAN BE MORE FRIGHTFUL THAN A WORLD AT-WAR
THEY FORGED NO CHAINS BUILT NO DUNGEONS ERECTED NO SCAFFOLDS--TORE NO FLESH WITH RED HOT PINCERS--DISLOCATED NO JOINTS ON RACKS--CRUSHED NO BONES IN IRON BOOTS--EXTINGUISHED NO EYES--TORE OUT NO TONGUES AND LIGHTED NO FAGOTS
AND YET WE DREAM AND STILL WE ASK IS THERE BEYOND THE SILENT NIGHT AN ENDLESS DAY
IF SATAN CAST OUT SATAN HE IS DIVIDED AGAINST HIMSELF WHY DID NOT CHRIST TELL THE PHARISEES THAT HE DID NOT CAST OUT DEVILS--ONLY PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL
IT IS A LIE AND I HATE YOUR RELIGION
I THANK THE GREAT SCIENTISTS--THOSE WHO HAVE REACHED THE FOUNDATION THE BED-ROCK--WHO HAVE BUILT UPON FACTS--THE GREAT SCIENTISTS IN WHOSE PRESENCE THEOLOGIANS LOOK SILLY AND FEEL MALICIOUS
NOW THIS MAN JUDAS PURCHASED A FIELD WITH THE REWARD OF INIQUITY--AND FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST ASUNDER AND ALL HIS BOWELS GUSHED OUT--THAT FIELD IS CALLED THE FIELD OF BLOOD MATTHEW SAYS JUDAS REPENTED AND GAVE BACK THE MONEY
THE DEVIL KNEW THAT CHRIST WAS GOD AND KNEW THAT CHRIST KNEW THAT THE TEMPTER WAS THE DEVIL
HE WILL CURE OR AVOID MANY DISEASES
THE CHILDREN OF MOTHERS WHO DISLIKE OR HATE OR LOATHE THE FATHERS WILL FILL THE WORLD WITH INSANITY AND CRIME
MATTHEW AND LUKE BOTH TRY TO SHOW THAT CHRIST WAS OF THE BLOOD OF DAVID THAT HE WAS A DESCENDANT OF THAT VIRTUOUS KING
HER SUPERSTITION IS NOT LOST
HE HAS PERSECUTED IMPRISONED AND DESTROYED HIS FELLOWS
WHOEVER SAW ANGELS WITH SANDALS ANGELO ANSWERED WITH ANOTHER QUESTION
TO ME MARY MAGDALENE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHARACTER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
AS IT IS NOW THERE IS BUT LITTLE REFORM
NO MAN AND NO BODY OF MEN CAN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF THE WHENCE AND WHITHER
THEY DIFFER IN TEMPERAMENT IN EXPERIENCE IN CAPACITY IN SURROUNDINGS
AT THAT TIME LONDON WAS THE MOST POPULOUS CAPITAL IN EUROPE YET IT WAS DIRTY ILL BUILT WITHOUT ANY SANITARY PROVISIONS WHATEVER
DID THEY PRODUCE ANYTHING TO SATISFY THE HUNGER OF MAN
CONCLUSION THE OLD TESTAMENT IS ABSURD IGNORANT AND CRUEL,--THE NEW TESTAMENT IS A MINGLING OF THE FALSE AND TRUE--IT IS GOOD AND BAD
HE WAS SHORN OF HIS STRENGTH BY DELILAH THE SHADOW--THE DARKNESS
ANY CLERGYMAN WHO CAN READ THE BIBLE AND THEN SAY THAT DEVILS ARE PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL IS HIMSELF A PERSONIFICATION OF STUPIDITY OR HYPOCRISY
THAT WE MUST BELIEVE THE APOSTLES CREED
HIS FEELING FOR REVENGE GROWS
THEY ARE PARASITES THAT FEED ON THE FRIGHTENED
STEAMSHIPS CONQUERED THE SEAS AND RAILWAYS COVERED THE LAND
HE DELIGHTED IN THE COMPANY OF THE QUESTIONLESS
THEY ENJOY TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH THE MULTITUDE
A DIFFERENCE ABOUT FORE-ORDINATION
OUR HANDS OUR BODIES ARE DEFORMED BY TOIL
HE WAS PERSECUTED AND IMPRISONED AS MOST SENSIBLE MEN WERE IN THOSE BLESSED DAYS
THEY PRODUCE NOTHING
THE MACHINE OWNS HIM
A GIRL COUNTS THE LEAVES OF A FLOWER AND SHE SAYS
A MAN OF THOUGHT AND SENSE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
CERTAINLY THEY WERE NOT CHRISTIAN SAINTS
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY DEVISED FOR THE RICH AND POOR TO GET ACQUAINTED
FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS PEACE HAS BEEN PREACHED AND YET THE CIVILIZED NATIONS ARE THE MOST WARLIKE OF THE WORLD
IT FOUNDED THE INQUISITION FORGED THE CHAINS AND FURNISHED THE FAGOTS
ITS MEMBERS SHOULD BE SELECTED BY THE VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS TO BE AFFECTED BY ITS DECISIONS AND AT THE COMMAND AND DISPOSAL OF THIS COURT THE REST OF CHRISTENDOM BEING DISARMED THERE SHOULD BE A MILITARY FORCE SUFFICIENT TO CARRY ITS JUDGMENTS INTO EFFECT
FAITH AND FILTH LIVED OR RATHER DIED TOGETHER
THIS IS THE RESULT OF A DUE ADMIXTURE OF COWARDICE HYPOCRISY AND MALICE
THEY KNEW THAT HELL WAS MADE FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS
THE SAYINGS THAT ARE IN MY JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN HIS PHILOSOPHY I ACCEPT AND THE OTHERS I THROW AWAY
WE ARE SEEKING THE TRUTH TRYING TO FIND WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO INCREASE THE WELL-BEING OF MAN
SO WE ARE TOLD THAT JESUS CAST OUT MANY DEVILS AND SUFFERED NOT THE DEVILS TO SPEAK BECAUSE THEY KNEW HIM
AFTER ALL WE KNOW BUT LITTLE
THE TONGUELESS SECRET LOCKED IN FATE WE DO NOT KNOW WE HOPE AND WAIT
ACCORDING TO THEIR ACCOUNT BRUTUS A ROMAN CONQUERED ENGLAND BUILT LONDON CALLED THE COUNTRY BRITAIN AFTER HIMSELF
THE CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE BEYOND THE IMAGINATION
GREAT THOUGHTS ARE NEVER LOST AND WORDS OF KINDNESS DO NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH
IN JOHN THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS OF THE CASTING OUT OF DEVILS BY CHRIST OR HIS APOSTLES
PORTUGAL SLOWLY DYING GROWING POORER EVERY DAY STILL CLINGS TO THE FAITH
THEY PRODUCED ROMANCES AND NOVELS AND ESSAYS ON MANY SUBJECTS
AND LET EACH ONE TO THE EXTENT OF HIS ABILITY HELP HIS FELLOW-MEN
ALL THESE PEOPLE COULD HOWEVER BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES NAMELY THE ROBBED AND THE ROBBERS
BEING INFINITE HE IS CONDITIONLESS
THE LIFE OF NO ONE WAS SECURE MALICIOUS ENEMIES HAD ONLY TO CHARGE ONE WITH WITCHCRAFT PROVE A FEW ODD SAYINGS AND QUEER ACTIONS TO SECURE THE DEATH OF THEIR VICTIM
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS IN EVERY WAR BETWEEN THE NOBLES AND THE KING EACH PARTY ENDEAVORED BY CONCILIATION TO GET THE PEASANTS UPON THEIR SIDE
THE NURSERY SHOULD NOT BE AN ASYLUM FOR LIES
THERE WAS BROUGHT UNTO JESUS ONE POSSESSED WITH A DEVIL BLIND AND DUMB AND JESUS HEALED HIM
WE WAIT AND HOPE
I COULD ENUMERATE THOUSANDS OF INSTANCES OF THE MOST HORRID CRUELTY PERPETRATED UPON MEN WOMEN AND EVEN LITTLE CHILDREN FOR NO OTHER REASON IN THE WORLD THAN FOR A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION UPON A SUBJECT THAT NEITHER PARTY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT
YOU CANNOT REFORM THESE PEOPLE WITH TRACTS AND TALK
THE INVENTOR OF PINS DID A THOUSAND TIMES MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE POPES AND CARDINALS THE BISHOPS AND PRIESTS--THAN ALL THE CLERGYMEN AND PARSONS EXHORTERS AND THEOLOGIANS THAT EVER LIVED
THIS PRODUCES WAR
THIS IS NOT A COINCIDENCE--AN ACCIDENT
THROUGH GULLIES FILLED WITH MUD CARRIAGES WERE DRAGGED BY OXEN
I THANK THE GREAT NOVELISTS
MADE HAPPINESS HERE THE ROAD TO HELL DENOUNCED LOVE AS BASE AND BESTIAL CANONIZED CREDULITY CROWNED BIGOTRY AND DESTROYED THE LIBERTY OF MAN
MOST OF THESE FRIGHTFUL LAWS HAVE BEEN REPEALED AND THE REPEAL CERTAINLY DID NOT INCREASE CRIME
THEN HE DESCRIBED LAZARUS HIS POVERTY HIS RAGS AND WRETCHEDNESS HIS POOR BODY EATEN BY DISEASE THE CRUSTS AND CRUMBS HE DEVOURED THE DOGS THAT PITIED HIM
WHY SHOULD CHRISTIANS INSIST THAT A GOD OF INFINITE WISDOM GOODNESS AND POWER GOVERNS THE WORLD
THE INTEREST ON THIS DEBT AMOUNTS AT LEAST TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
IT IS NOT ONLY STUPID BUT MALICIOUS
I WILL FOLLOW THEE BUT FIRST LET ME GO BID THEM FAREWELL WHICH ARE AT HOME JESUS SAID
POSSIBLY THERE ARE CURATIVE VIRTUES IN OLD BONES IN SACRED RAGS AND HOLY HAIRS IN IMAGES AND BITS OF WOOD IN RUSTY NAILS AND DRIED BLOOD BUT THE TROUBLE IS WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THEY HAVE FOLLOWED THE FIFE AND DRUM OF SOME PARTY
SOMEBODY HAD TO FATHER THE MISTAKES OF GOD
WE ARE TOLD THAT JESUS WAS LED BY THE SPIRIT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL
IN THE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY THE DESTRUCTION IS COMPLETE
WOULD JOHN KNOX HAVE BEEN ANY WORSE HAD HE DESERTED CHRIST AND BECOME A FOLLOWER OF CONFUCIUS
LEWIS MEGGLETON HAD GIVEN HIMSELF OUT AS THE LAST AND THE GREATEST OF THE PROPHETS HAVING POWER TO SAVE OR DAMN
THE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY OF A TRIBE OF A NATION WHO INCREASE THE HAPPINESS OF THE FAMILY OF THE TRIBE OR OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED GOOD MEMBERS
BUT IN THE BOOK OF JOB SATAN THE DEVIL HAS A CONVERSATION WITH GOD
HE WAS SO SAVING OF MERCY SO EXTRAVAGANT IN MURDER SO ANXIOUS TO KILL SO READY TO ASSASSINATE THAT I HATED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART
ALL THESE HORRORS FADE INTO ALLEGORIES
THE REFORMS THAT I HAVE MENTIONED CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A DAY POSSIBLY NOT FOR MANY CENTURIES
AND WE KNOW THAT MAN HAS LIVED AND STRUGGLED THROUGH WANT AND WAR THROUGH PESTILENCE AND FAMINE THROUGH IGNORANCE AND CRIME THROUGH FEAR AND HOPE ON THE OLD EARTH FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YEARS
WHY HAS HE ALLOWED INJUSTICE TO TRIUMPH
AND YET WE QUESTION DREAM AND GUESS BUT KNOWLEDGE WE DO NOT POSSESS
TO FILL THE MINDS OF CHILDREN WITH LEERING FIENDS--WITH MOCKING DEVILS--IS ONE OF THE MEANEST AND BASEST OF CRIMES
THE USEFUL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DESPISED
SO ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT THE HIGHEST AMBITION IS TO BE HAPPY AND TO ADD TO THE WELL-BEING OF OTHERS
THEY ARE INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER
ONE DROP OF WATER AS WONDERFUL AS ALL THE SEAS
CHILDREN DO NOT AND CANNOT BELIEVE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE TAUGHT
IT IS OF MORE VALUE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE
SOME OF THESE MINISTERS AVOWED THEIR BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE OF HIS SATANIC MAJESTY WHILE OTHERS ACTUALLY DENIED HIS EXISTENCE
THE GENIUS OF SHAKESPEARE COULD NOT MAKE THE THEOLOGY OF MILTON POETIC
IT WAS THE DEADLY ENEMY OF MEDICINE
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE WORKINGMAN AND THE CAPITALIST
TOO MUCH DOUBT IS BETTER THAN TOO MUCH CREDULITY
I CONCLUDED THAT ALL RELIGIONS HAD THE SAME FOUNDATION--A BELIEF IN THE SUPERNATURAL--A POWER ABOVE NATURE THAT MAN COULD INFLUENCE BY WORSHIP--BY SACRIFICE AND PRAYER
JESUS REFUSED
THAT WE WERE ABSOLUTELY COMPELLED BY LAW TO HAND BACK THAT HUMAN BEING TO THE LASH AND CHAIN
FOR THIS VAST AMOUNT OF MONEY THE RETURNS ARE REMARKABLY SMALL
LET EACH ONE BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER--SUBSTANCE--CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
MAN HAD NO RIGHT TO PREVENT DISEASE--DISEASES WERE SENT BY GOD AS JUDGMENTS
IT PRETENDED TO HAVE A REVELATION FROM GOD--THE SCRIPTURES IN WHICH COULD BE FOUND ALL KNOWLEDGE--EVERYTHING THAT MAN COULD NEED IN THE JOURNEY OF LIFE
THEY ANSWERED THE GEOLOGISTS BY SAYING THAT THE DAYS IN GENESIS WERE LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND THAT AFTER ALL THE FLOOD MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOCAL
THIS PREDICTION WAS ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED BY THE LEADING MEN OF THE EMPIRE NOT ONLY BUT OF ALL EUROPE
IN HIS NAME MILLIONS AND MILLIONS HAVE BEEN ENSLAVED
THE PREACHER SAID THAT HE COULD GIVE HIM NO HOPE UNLESS HE HAD FAITH IN CHRIST AND THAT IF HE HAD NO FAITH HIS SOUL WOULD CERTAINLY BE LOST
THAT PLACE AND POWER ARE NOT NECESSARY TO SUCCESS
IF YOU WANT LESS CRIME YOU MUST CHANGE THE CONDITIONS
NEITHER DO WE BELIEVE THAT OTHERS ARE SUBJECTS OR SERFS OR SLAVES BY REASON OF ANY SUPERNATURAL WILL
AND YOU DO THIS TO PROTECT YOURSELF
IN A LITTLE WHILE I WILL DIE AND THEN I GO TO HELL
WE KNOW THAT MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN EXIST
WHY SALT SHOULD BE REVENGEFUL AND VINEGAR FORGIVING HAS NEVER BEEN TOLD
HE SHOULD WEIGH THE EVIDENCE THE ARGUMENTS IN HONEST SCALES--SCALES THAT PASSION OR INTEREST CANNOT CHANGE
THEY HAD NO DOUBTS
THIS IN A GENERAL WAY IS THE DEFINITION OF RELIGION
THOU SHALT NOT SUFFER A WITCH TO LIVE THIS ONE COMMANDMENT--THIS SIMPLE LINE--DEMONSTRATES THAT JEHOVAH WAS NOT ONLY NOT GOD BUT THAT HE WAS A POOR IGNORANT SUPERSTITIOUS SAVAGE
AND HE THAT LOVETH SON OR DAUGHTER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME CHRIST IT SEEMS HAD A PHILOSOPHY
THEY CONFESSED AND DIED WITHOUT A PRAYER
TASTE AND LOVE ARE NOT THE SERVANTS OF THE WILL
THIS WORLD IS HIS MOTHER
THESE FACTS ARE FULL OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
THEY HAVE STUDIED THE SYMBOLS THE CEREMONIES THE PRAYERS AND SACRIFICES
SCIENCE IS THE ONLY CIVILIZER
THINK OF THE HOMES IT WOULD BUILD THE CHILDREN IT WOULD CLOTHE
TOUCH ME NOT THIS WAS THE REWARD OF HER INFINITE DEVOTION
SECOND_.--IS AN INFINITE GOD THE GOVERNOR OF THIS WORLD
THE DEVIL WAS NO MYTH
ASK NO QUESTIONS FALL UPON YOUR KNEES
WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO SUPERNATURAL REMEDIES
THEY HAVE FILLED THE WORLD WITH CONVENIENCES COMFORTS AND LUXURIES
THESE CONTRADICTIONS ARE GROSS AND PALPABLE AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE NEW TESTAMENT IS NOT INSPIRED AND THAT MANY OF ITS STATEMENTS MUST BE FALSE
LAWS EQUALLY UNJUST BLOODY AND CRUEL WERE IN FORCE IN ALL PARTS OF EUROPE
IF THIS GOD EXISTS HE HAS ON MANY OCCASIONS SEEN MILLIONS OF HIS POOR CHILDREN PLOWING THE FIELDS SOWING AND PLANTING THE GRAIN AND WHEN HE SAW THEM HE KNEW THAT THEY DEPENDED ON THE EXPECTED CROP FOR LIFE AND YET THIS GOOD GOD THIS MERCIFUL BEING WITHHELD THE RAIN
NATURAL CAUSES WERE NOT BELIEVED IN
HE HAS ALLOWED MEN TO ENSLAVE THEIR BROTHERS AND TO SELL BABES FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS
YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE ENEMIES OF PROGRESS ALLOWED BOOKS TO BE PUBLISHED OR READ WHEN THEY HAD THE POWER TO PREVENT IT
WE LOVED EACH OTHER AND THE CHILDREN
WHAT IS THE OLDEST MANUSCRIPT OF THE BIBLE WE HAVE IN HEBREW
LET US SEE WHAT THE WORLDLY HAVE DONE--WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THOSE NOT CALLED NOT SET APART NOT INSPIRED NOT FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST--BY THOSE WHO WERE NEGLECTED BY ALL THE GODS
AS MAN ADVANCED HE SLOWLY CHANGED HIS GOD--TOOK A LITTLE FEROCITY FROM HIS HEART AND PUT THE LIGHT OF KINDNESS IN HIS EYES
IN NATURE THERE ARE OPPOSING FORCES
THINK OF LIFE FEEDING ON LIFE
IT RISES FROM THE HEART LIKE PERFUME FROM A FLOWER
THEY HAVE TRIED PROMISES AND THREATS
THE GEOLOGISTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE AUTHOR OF GENESIS WAS MISTAKEN AS TO THE AGE OF THE WORLD AND THAT THE STORY OF THE UNIVERSE HAVING BEEN CREATED IN SIX DAYS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND YEARS AGO COULD NOT BE TRUE
THE DEVIL ALSO TOOK HIM TO JERUSALEM AND SET HIM ON A PINNACLE OF THE TEMPLE AND TRIED TO INDUCE HIM TO LEAP TO THE EARTH
IN HER ZEAL SHE DESTROYED HERSELF
ON ACCOUNT OF THIS GOD CURSED THE EARTH WITH WEEDS AND THORNS AND BRAMBLES CURSED MAN WITH TOIL MADE WOMAN A SLAVE AND CURSED MATERNITY WITH PAIN AND SORROW
WHY INVESTIGATE WHY DISCUSS WHY THINK WHEN YOU KNOW
WHY I AM AN AGNOSTIC
WHY I AM AN AGNOSTIC
AT LAST WE KNOW THAT INFALLIBLE POPES AND COUNTLESS PRIESTS AND CLERGYMEN WHO HAD BEEN CALLED FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND PRESIDENTS OF COLLEGES KINGS EMPERORS AND EXECUTIVES OF NATIONS HAD MISTAKEN THE BLUNDERING GUESSES OF IGNORANT SAVAGES FOR THE WISDOM OF AN INFINITE GOD
IT HAS TO BE PAID BY LABOR MUCH OF IT BY THE POOR BY THOSE WHO ARE COMPELLED TO DENY THEMSELVES ALMOST THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE
EVERY CRIME IS BORN OF NECESSITY
LET US BE PERFECTLY CANDID WITH EACH OTHER
THERE IS NO TIME TO GIVE THE HISTORY OF THIS BELIEF IN DEVILS
WHAT WOULD WE SAY
ALL THAT THE HUMAN RACE HAS SUFFERED IN WAR AND WANT IN PESTILENCE AND FAMINE IN FIRE AND FLOOD,--ALL THE PANGS AND PAINS OF EVERY DISEASE AND EVERY DEATH--ALL THIS IS AS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE AGONIES TO BE ENDURED BY ONE LOST SOUL
ON SOME OCCASIONS ANIMALS WERE RECEIVED AS WITNESSES IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
THAT CHRIST TAUGHT NOTHING OF THE KIND
THE HUMAN RACE IS ADVANCING
THE WORLD IS BEFORE HIM
HAS ANY DISASTER BEEN AVERTED--ANY BLESSING OBTAINED
MATTHEW OF PARIS AN EMINENT HISTORIAN OF THE 13TH CENTURY GAVE THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING PIECE OF VALUABLE INFORMATION
SPEECH IS FREE
THIS IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE
SPAIN WAS AT ONE TIME OWNER OF HALF THE EARTH AND HELD WITHIN HER GREEDY HANDS THE GOLD AND SILVER OF THE WORLD
WOULD CALVIN HAVE BEEN MORE BLOODTHIRSTY IF HE HAD BELIEVED IN THE RELIGION OF THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS
THEY DIFFER AS THE MEN DIFFERED WHO WROTE THEM
WHEN HE READS THESE STORIES THESE RECORDS HE WILL KNOW THAT MAN MUST RELY ON HIMSELF,--THAT THE SUPERNATURAL DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT MAN MUST BE THE PROVIDENCE OF MAN
IS IT POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THE DEVIL IN JOB WAS ONLY A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL
THERE IS NO GOD BUT ALLAH AND MOHAMMED IS HIS PROPHET IF OUR PARENTS HAD LIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE GANGES WE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSHIPERS OF SIVA LONGING FOR THE HEAVEN OF NIRVANA
SAYING WHERE IS HE THAT IS BORN KING OF THE JEWS
THE MAN OF STRAW TOOK FATHER MCGLYNN BY THE COLLAR FORCED HIM TO HIS KNEES MADE HIM TAKE BACK HIS WORDS AND ASK FORGIVENESS FOR HAVING BEEN ABUSED
IF DEATH IS I AM NOT
IN THE SHADOW OF THIS TREMENDOUS FACT HIS COURAGE DIES HIS MANHOOD IS LOST AND IN HIS FEAR HE CRIES OUT THAT HE BELIEVES WHETHER HE DOES OR NOT
SO THAT THE COST IN OUR COUNTRY IS ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK AND COUNTING TEN HOURS AS A WORKING DAY THIS AMOUNTS TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MINUTE
THE MAN WITH TOIL THE WOMAN WITH SLAVERY AND PAIN AND BOTH WITH DEATH
THAT MONEY WILL SEPARATE HIM FROM HIS FRIENDS
THEY HAVE CROWNED AND UNCROWNED KINGS AND QUEENS
I THANK THE FATHER WHO SPOKE THE FIRST GENTLE WORD THE MOTHER WHO FIRST SMILED UPON HER BABE
THE INTERPRETERS OF NATURE ARE THE TRUE AND ONLY PRIESTS
FORCE MAY BE CHANGED FROM ONE FORM TO ANOTHER--FROM MOTION TO HEAT--BUT IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED--ANNIHILATED
ALL THAT TIME I KNEW NOTHING OF ANY SCIENCE--NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE--NOTHING OF THE OBJECTIONS THAT HAD BEEN URGED AGAINST THE BLESSED SCRIPTURES OR AGAINST THE PERFECT CONGREGATIONAL CREED
WE CAN BEND ABOVE OUR PALLID DEAD AND SAY THAT BEYOND THIS LIFE THERE ARE NO SIGHS--NO TEARS--NO BREAKING HEARTS
IT SEEMS TO ME IMPOSSIBLE FOR A CIVILIZED MAN TO LOVE OR WORSHIP OR RESPECT THE GOD OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THEY WERE EQUAL TO THE MOST TERRIBLE AND VIVID PICTURES EVEN OF HELL AND THE INQUISITORS WERE EVEN MORE HORRID FIENDS THAN EVEN A REAL PERDITION COULD BOAST
THE CITIZENS SHOULD TAKE PRIDE IN THIS BUILDING
BUT I EXPECT THE GREATEST GOOD TO COME FROM CIVILIZATION FROM THE GROWTH OF A SENSE OF JUSTICE
THERE HAD BEEN A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE SCRIPTURES AND A SAILOR
THIS IS THE CHRISTIAN PROPHECY OF THE ETERNAL FUTURE
SLAVERY IS NOT THE SOIL OR RAIN OF VIRTUE
IN THE PURITAN YEAR THERE WERE TWELVE DECEMBERS
ALL THE GREAT COMMENTATORS BELIEVED IN THE DEVIL AS FIRMLY AS THEY DID IN GOD
PROGRESS HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON EVERY SOUL
IT CHARGED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITH BEING IN LEAGUE WITH SATAN TO INJURE THEIR FELLOWS
THINK OF THE MAIMED THE MUTILATED THE MANGLED
IT GAVE US THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD--OF THE STARS AND THE BEGINNING OF ALL THINGS
THAT CHRIST WENT TO HELL AND PREACHED TO THE SPIRITS IN PRISON
HOW DID THEY ENTER INTO THE BODY OF THE MAN
THIS GOD AND THIS DEVIL WERE AT WAR EACH TRYING TO SECURE THE SOULS OF MEN
IT HAD BEEN DEFORMED BY SLAVERY
A GOOD LAW ONE SPRINGING FROM THE NATURE OF THINGS CANNOT DEMAND AND CANNOT ACCEPT AND CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH THE PUNISHMENT OR THE AGONY OF THE INNOCENT
THEY LIVED IN A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE AT A TIME WHEN RUMOR WAS THE HISTORIAN WHEN GOSSIP CORRECTED THE PROOF AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS BELIEVED EXCEPT THE FACTS
INDUSTRY BEGAN TO BE REMUNERATIVE AND RESPECTABLE
SO WHEN THE YOUNG MAN ASKED HIM WHAT HE MUST DO TO BE SAVED HE SAID
THE PIOUS NEGRO WHO COMMENCED HIS PRAYER
HE INTENDED TO FAIL
FOR THOUSANDS OF AGES MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LOVE THE GODS--TRYING TO SOFTEN THEIR HEARTS--TRYING TO GET THEIR AID
IN THE 10TH CENTURY AFTER CHRIST THE SARACENS--GOVERNORS OF A VAST EMPIRE--"ESTABLISHED COLLEGES IN MONGOLIA TARTARY PERSIA MESOPOTAMIA SYRIA EGYPT NORTH AFRICA MOROCCO FEZ AND IN SPAIN THE REGION OWNED BY THE SARACENS WAS GREATER THAN THE ROMAN EMPIRE
THE FIRST REFERENCE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT TO THE DEVIL IS IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER OF MATTHEW
NEITHER WILL IT DO TO SAY THAT THE DEVIL--THE SERPENT--WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL
MUST A POOR WOMAN SUPPORT HERSELF OR HER CHILD OR HER CHILDREN BY THAT KIND OF LABOR AND WITH SUCH PAY--AND DO WE CALL OURSELVES CIVILIZED
AND THE CHURCH SAYS TO THE READERS
A WOMAN DOWERS HER HUSBAND WITH HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY
HE KNOWS THAT A GLANCE AT THE MOON OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER IS AS HEALTHFUL AND LUCKY AS ONE OVER THE RIGHT
ALL ROADS LED TO ROME AND THESE ROADS WERE FILLED WITH PILGRIMS BEARING GIFTS AND YET ITALY IN SPITE OF ALL THE PRAYERS STEADILY PURSUED THE DOWNWARD PATH DIED AND WAS BURIED AND WOULD AT THIS MOMENT BE IN HER GRAVE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR CAVOUR MAZZINI AND GARIBALDI
THEY HAVE ENDEAVORED TO WEAKEN AND SHRIVEL THEIR BRAINS UNTIL TO THEM THERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN EVIDENCE AND BELIEF--BETWEEN FACT AND FAITH
THOU DUMB AND DEAF SPIRIT I CHARGE THEE COME OUT OF HIM AND ENTER NO MORE INTO HIM AND THE SPIRIT CRIED AND RENT HIM SORE AND CAME OUT OF HIM
BUT IN THE NEXT LIFE THIS WILL BE REVERSED
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT WE FIND ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS CHRIST
ATE WAS THE SPIRIT THAT TEMPTED AND SUCH WAS HER POWER THAT AT ONE TIME SHE TEMPTED AND MISLED THE GOD OF GODS EVEN ZEUS HIMSELF
HE CAUSED THE SUN TO RISE TO STEAL ALL MOISTURE FROM THE LAND BUT GAVE NO RAIN
HE WAS IN PERFECTLY GOOD SOCIETY--IN THE COMPANY OF GOD--OF THE TRINITY
THIS ONE LINE PROVES BEYOND ALL POSSIBLE DOUBT THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS WRITTEN BY MEN BY BARBARIANS
WE CAN DRIVE FROM OUR MINDS THE FRIGHTFUL THINGS THAT TEAR AND WOUND WITH BEAK AND FANG
THEIR CIVILIZATION WAS A LIE
WHEN CHRIST MADE THIS PROMISE HE FORGOT IGNORED OR HELD IN CONTEMPT THE RECTITUDE OF A BRAVE FREE AND NATURAL SOUL
THEY FOUGHT
CAN WE THINK OF A BEING WITHOUT FORM WITHOUT BODY WITHOUT PARTS WITHOUT PASSIONS
AND THE CRIME OF WITCHCRAFT WAS PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN COURT AFTER COURT IN EVERY TOWN OF EUROPE
TIME CANNOT BE WASTED--CANNOT BE LOST
DIABOLUS WHO DRIVES TO DESPAIR AND MAMMON PRINCE OF THE TEMPTERS
THE LABOR QUESTION--EMPLOYERS CANNOT GOVERN PRICES--RAILROADS SHOULD PAY PENSIONS--WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF LABOR--VII
THEY WERE HATED AND DESPISED
HANNIBAL EXPOSED TO SALE THIRTY THOUSAND CAPTIVES AT ONE TIME ALL OF WHOM WERE ROMAN CITIZENS
BUT WHERE IS THIS HEAVEN AND WHERE IS THIS HELL
THE MAN OF STRAW RULES EVERY SECTARIAN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE--EVERY ORTHODOX CHURCH
AND WE KNOW THAT ALL THESE MILLIONS BELIEVE THROUGH BLIND UNREASONING FAITH HOLDING ALL EVIDENCE AND ALL FACTS IN THEOLOGICAL CONTEMPT
HE TAKES THE RIGHT ROAD AND THEREUPON THESE THEOLOGIANS SAY THERE IS A POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND
BELIEVE AND GIVE A NEW ERA IS DAWNING ON THE WORLD
FOR THE UTTERANCE OF THIS SUBLIME SENTIMENT HIS PROFESSORSHIP WAS TAKEN FROM HIM HE WAS DRIVEN FROM GENEVA BY JOHN CALVIN AND HIS ADHERENTS ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THEIR SECT
I THANK THOSE WHO CULTIVATED THE GROUND AND CHANGED THE FORESTS INTO FARMS--THOSE WHO BUILT RUDE HOMES AND WATCHED THE FACES OF THEIR HAPPY CHILDREN IN THE GLOW OF FIRESIDE FLAMES--THOSE WHO DOMESTICATED HORSES CATTLE AND SHEEP--THOSE WHO INVENTED WHEELS AND LOOMS AND TAUGHT US TO SPIN AND WEAVE--THOSE WHO BY CULTIVATION CHANGED WILD GRASSES INTO WHEAT AND CORN CHANGED BITTER THINGS TO FRUIT AND WORTHLESS WEEDS TO FLOWERS THAT SOWED WITHIN OUR SOULS THE SEEDS OF ART
IF MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM ETERNITY THEN WE CAN SAY THAT MAN HAD NO INTELLIGENT CREATOR--THAT MAN WAS NOT A SPECIAL CREATION
IF GOD IS INFINITE HE DOES NOT WANT
THE CHEMIST WITH CRUCIBLE AND RETORT WITH COUNTLESS EXPERIMENTS IS TRYING TO FIND THE QUALITIES OF SUBSTANCES--TO RAVEL WHAT NATURE HAS WOVEN
THAT HE WAS BY NATURE A CHILD OF THE DEVIL AND THAT NEW-BORN BABES WERE TENANTED BY UNCLEAN SPIRITS
WE CAN DESTROY THE MONSTERS OF SUPERSTITION THE HISSING SNAKES OF IGNORANCE AND FEAR
IS THIS TRUE
IS THIS TRUE
IS THIS TRUE
THE CRIMINAL IS DANGEROUS AND SOCIETY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITSELF
WE CAN HAVE THE LUXURIES OF EVERY CLIMATE
WHAT EVIDENCE IS THIS
TO THEM THE INSANE WERE INSPIRED
HOW THE PECULIARITY OF THE EYES OF THE FIRST ONE WHO ENTERS CHANGES THE INTENTION OF A COMMUNITY OR HOW THE INTENTIONS OF A COMMUNITY CAUSE THE CROSS-EYED MAN TO GO EARLY HAS NEVER BEEN SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED
OUR FATHERS BELIEVED THAT THEY COULD BY PRAYER BY SACRIFICE BY FASTING BY PERFORMING CERTAIN CEREMONIES GAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THIS GOD AND OF THESE GOOD SPIRITS
PLENTY OF THEOLOGY BUT NO TOBACCO NO BOOKS NO PICTURES NOT A PICTURE IN ALL PALESTINE NOT A PIECE OF STATUARY NOT A PLOUGH THAT WOULD SCOUR
AH SAID THE OLD MAN BUT THE ONE I SAW HAD AN IRON CRANK IN IT OF COURSE I DO NOT BLAME THE AUTHORS OF THE GOSPELS
DURING ALL THESE YEARS AND BY ALL THESE PEOPLES IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THIS GOD HEARD AND ANSWERED PRAYER THAT HE FORGAVE SINS AND SAVED THE SOULS OF TRUE BELIEVERS
NOW THE QUESTION IS
THE INFINITE KNOWS NEITHER LOSS NOR GAIN
THEY TEACH THE CRINGING VIRTUES OF SERFS
WITHOUT FAITH ALL THE SO-CALLED VIRTUES WERE SINS AND THE MEN WHO PRACTICED THESE VIRTUES WITHOUT FAITH DESERVED TO SUFFER ETERNAL PAIN
THAT YOU MUST BELIEVE IN THE TRINITY
I SEE THEM CLAD IN RAGS HUDDLED IN DENS AND HUTS DEVOURING CRUSTS AND SCRAPS THAT THEY MAY GIVE THE MORE TO GHOSTS AND GODS
WAS HE GOD BEFORE HE WAS BORN
WHEN THEY WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE NOBLES THEY TOLD THE PEOPLE THAT THE KING WAS A TYRANT
THEN HE FINDS GOD THE MAKER OF THE MAN AND HE IS SO MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE MAN THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE HAD A MAKER
THESE MINISTERS OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEIR CREEDS ARE BASED ON IMAGINED FACTS AND DEMONSTRATED BY ASSERTION
AS MAN ADVANCES HE MAKES TOOLS WITH WHICH TO FASHION HIS WEAPONS
WE CAN BE AS HONEST AS WE ARE IGNORANT
THEY ARE TOO GENEROUS OR THEY ARE TOO NEGLIGENT
WERE THEY SHADOWS IMPERSONATIONS ALLEGORIES
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY WAS THEN HEATH AND SWAMP
WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
THIS CHRISTIANS CALL SATISFYING THE LAW VII
IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WE RELY UPON THE GALLOWS THE PENITENTIARY AND THE JAIL
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THERE IS BUT ONE WAY
UNSEEN AND UNHEARD THEY HAVE SAT ON THEIR THRONES DEAF AND DUMB--PARALYZED AND BLIND
AT THAT TIME THE WORLD WAS GOVERNED BY PRIESTS
SUFFER ME FIRST TO GO AND BURY MY FATHER CHRIST ANSWERED
NOTHING BUT FALSEHOOD NEEDS THE ASSISTANCE OF FAME AND PLACE OF ROBES AND MITRES OF TIARAS AND CROWNS
HE HAS FASTED AND STARVED
NOW THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG THERE
THAT FORTY MEN WERE SENT TO ATTACK THIS GIANT AND THAT HE TOOK THEM UNDER HIS ARMS AND QUIETLY CARRIED THEM AWAY
IF A MAN COULD MAKE A STONE FALLING IN THE AIR PASS THROUGH A SPACE OF TEN FEET THE FIRST SECOND TWENTY-FIVE FEET THE SECOND SECOND AND FIVE FEET THE THIRD SECOND THAT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IN PHYSICS
HE KNOWS THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES A BELIEF IN THESE DEVILS THESE EVIL SPIRITS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY UNIVERSAL
THE ZACHARIAS THAT WAS SLAIN WAS THE SON OF BARUCH
YOU PUT ON AIRS ABOVE HIM BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN THE PENITENTIARY
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THIS GOD
THEY KNEW THE BEGINNING OF THINGS
THESE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE SETTLED BY REASON BY CANDOR BY INTELLIGENCE BY KINDNESS
AND THAT WITH THESE PERSONIFICATIONS BEELZEBUB HAD NOTHING TO DO
POVERTY FAILURE DISASTER DEFEAT POWER PLACE AND WEALTH WOULD BECOME MEANINGLESS SOUNDS
IT DESTROYED THE MARBLES OF GREECE AND ROME
DID THEY DISCOVER OR SHOW US HOW TO PRODUCE ANYTHING FOR FOOD
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND IT AND I MUST MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF MY SOUL
WE KNOW THE CONSOLATION THEY HAVE GIVEN AND THE PAIN THEY HAVE INFLICTED--THE LIES THEY HAVE DEFENDED--THE TRUTHS THEY HAVE DENIED
THAT THE DEVIL WAS A KING AND THAT LIE AND HIS IMPS WAGED WAR AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF MEN
I READ THE WORKS OF THESE GREAT MEN--OF MANY OTHERS--AND BECAME CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE RIGHT AND THAT ALL THE THEOLOGIANS--ALL THE BELIEVERS IN SPECIAL CREATION WERE ABSOLUTELY WRONG
IT WILL TEACH THE RELIGION OF USEFULNESS
I THANK SHELLEY FOR HIS SKYLARK KEATS FOR HIS GRECIAN URN AND BYRON FOR HIS PRISONER OF CHILLON
SO IT WAS BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE BY THE AID OF THE DEVIL COULD ASSUME ANY SHAPE THAT THEY WISHED
INSTEAD OF THIS THEY DISCOVERED THAT A PEASANT GIRL WHO LIVED IN PALESTINE WAS THE MOTHER OF GOD
I DO NOT DENY
I AM AN INDIVIDUALIST
IT UNSHEATHED THE SWORD LIGHTED THE FAGOT FORGED THE CHAIN BUILT THE DUNGEON ERECTED THE SCAFFOLD INVENTED AND USED THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
WE MUST WORK AND WAIT
WE MUST WORK AND WAIT
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE KING OCCUPIED HIS THRONE BECAUSE OF THE WILL OF THE SUPERNATURAL
THEY CALCULATED ECLIPSES EQUINOXES SOLSTICES CONJUNCTIONS OF PLANETS AND OCCULTATIONS OF STARS
ON THE OTHER HAND ARE THE ABJECT POOR
IGNORANCE IS THE SOIL IN WHICH BELIEF IN MIRACLES GROWS
HUMBOLDT HAD PUBLISHED HIS LECTURES--FILLED WITH GREAT THOUGHTS--WITH SPLENDID GENERALIZATIONS--WITH SUGGESTIONS THAT STIMULATED THE SPIRIT OF INVESTIGATION AND WITH CONCLUSIONS THAT SATISFIED THE MIND
THE BIOLOGISTS THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS THE READERS OF ANCIENT INSCRIPTIONS THE DELVERS IN BURIED CITIES WERE ALL HATED BY THE THEOLOGIANS
I WOULD EXEMPT A HOMESTEAD OF A REASONABLE VALUE SAY OF THE VALUE OF TWO OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT ONLY FROM SALE UNDER EXECUTION BUT FROM SALE FOR TAXES OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
THE MAKER DID NOT DESCEND FROM THE HEAVENS
THE NEW TESTAMENT VOUCHES FOR THE TRUTH THE INSPIRATION OF THE OLD AND IF THE OLD IS FALSE THE NEW CANNOT BE TRUE
MEN CANNOT REMAIN STATIONARY
WE KNOW THAT THEY DIVIDED KNOWLEDGE INTO SACRED AND PROFANE--TAUGHT THAT REVELATION WAS SACRED--THAT REASON WAS BLASPHEMOUS--THAT FAITH WAS HOLY AND FACTS FALSE
THEY ARE THE FOES OF FACTS--THE ENEMIES OF KNOWLEDGE
THEY FORGED CHAINS OF SUPERSTITION FOR THE ONE AND OF IRON FOR THE OTHER
THEY FIND SO MUCH TO CONDEMN IN THE PAST THAT THEY CONDEMN ALL
SAY NINE TIMES IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS
THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE
GOD IS LOVE THESE BABES WERE PURE AS PITY'S TEARS INNOCENT AS THEIR MOTHER'S LOVING SMILES AND YET THE MAKERS OF OUR CREEDS BELIEVED AND TAUGHT THAT LEERING UNCLEAN FIENDS INHABITED THEIR DIMPLED FLESH
AND NO ONE KNOWS AND NO ONE PRETENDS TO KNOW THE LOCALITY OF HELL
IT SAYS TO THE HAPPY
THIS WORD IS HOLY
TO THEM THE BIBLE MEANS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS
YET MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INSIST THAT THE WRITER OF GENESIS WAS INSPIRED BY THE CREATOR OF ALL WORLDS
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST WAS IN A GREAT DEGREE UNKNOWN
WHAT OTHER REASON
HER PRAYERS WERE NEVER ANSWERED
MOVABLE TYPES WERE INVENTED PAPER WAS BORROWED FROM THE MOORS BOOKS APPEARED AND IT BECAME POSSIBLE TO SAVE THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH SO THAT EACH GENERATION COULD HAND IT TO THE NEXT
THEY WERE AFRAID THAT THESE MEN MIGHT FIND SOMETHING INCONSISTENT WITH THE BIBLE
ALL WAS DONE BY THE SUPERNATURAL AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE BY EVIL SPIRITS THAT THEY COULD DO TO RUIN PUNISH MISLEAD AND DAMN THE CHILDREN OF MEN
EDUCATE THE CHILDREN--USELESS KNOWLEDGE--LIBERTY CANNOT BE SACRIFICED FOR THE SAKE OF ANYTHING--FALSE WORSHIP OF WEALTH--VIII
THE FOUNDERS OF ALL THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES--THE MAKERS OF ALL THE ORTHODOX CREEDS--ALL THE LEADING PROTESTANT THEOLOGIANS FROM LUTHER TO THE PRESIDENT OF PRINCETON COLLEGE--WERE AND ARE FIRM BELIEVERS IN THE DEVIL
THE INCARNATION HAS TO BE BELIEVED WITHOUT EVIDENCE
ITS AUDITORIUM SHOULD BE LIKE A THEATRE
IT IS THE SACRED LIGHT OF THE SOUL
HIS POOR LITTLE MIND IS FILLED WITH MIRACLES AND WONDERS
SUCH SERMONS DULL THE MORAL SENSE AND SUBVERT THE TRUE CONCEPTION OF VIRTUE AND DUTY
IS THERE A BEING OF INFINITE INTELLIGENCE POWER AND GOODNESS WHO GOVERNS THE WORLD
THE SOUL ROUSED FROM THE SLUMBERS OF A THOUSAND YEARS BEGAN TO THINK
IF THE OLD TESTAMENT TEACHES ANYTHING IT DOES TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL OF SATAN OF THE SERPENT OF THE ENEMY OF GOD AND MAN THE DECEIVER OF MEN AND WOMEN
SOMEBODY WHO WAS INSPIRED HAS SAID THAT CHRIST WAS OF THE BLOOD OF DAVID THROUGH HIS FATHER JOSEPH
WHY SHOULD I FEAR DEATH
THERE IS NO MASTER OF THE SHOW WHO WILL EXPLAIN OR FROM THE FUTURE TEAR THE MASK
WHAT BECAME OF THIS TRANSLATION KNOWN AS THE SEPTUAGINT
AT THE TIME HE ENTERED INTO JUDAS PERSUADING HIM TO BETRAY CHRIST HE KNEW THAT IF CHRIST WAS BETRAYED HE WOULD BE CRUCIFIED AND THAT HE WOULD MAKE AN ATONEMENT FOR ALL BELIEVERS AND THAT AS A RESULT HE THE DEVIL WOULD LOSE ALL THE SOULS THAT CHRIST GAINED
NOTHING SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN ANY SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHER DOES NOT KNOW
HIS CHILDREN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND FOR MANY AGES IN MANY LANDS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS MANY OF THEM THE KINDEST AND THE BEST ASKED FOR SUPERNATURAL HELP
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THE MALICE OF GOD IS INFINITE AND THE HUNGER OF HIS REVENGE ETERNAL
IT GAVE US GHOSTS AND GOBLINS SPOOKS AND SPRITES AND LITTLE DEVILS THAT SWARMED IN THE BODIES OF MEN AND IT GAVE US HELL WHERE THE SOULS OF MEN WILL ROAST IN ETERNAL FLAMES
THE DECREASE OF IMMORALITY AND POVERTY IS HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE
FACTS ARE THE MASTERS THE ENEMIES OF THE IGNORANT THE SERVANTS AND FRIENDS OF THE INTELLIGENT
WHAT EFFECT DID RELIGION HAVE ON SLAVERY
IN SHORT I CANNOT BETTER DESCRIBE TO YOU THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FRIENDS OF SLAVERY ACTED AT THAT TIME THAN BY SAYING THAT THEY ACTED PRECISELY AS THEY USED TO DO IN THE UNITED STATES
MEN HAVE NOT BUILT HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY WERE CHRISTIANS BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE MEN
IF THE NEW TESTAMENT IS THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD THEN I ADMIT THAT THESE DEVILS THESE IMPS DO ACTUALLY EXIST AND THAT THEY DO TAKE POSSESSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
THE COURT WOULD APPOINT COMMISSIONERS OR A JURY WOULD BE CALLED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE LAND THE PETITIONER WISHED FOR A HOME AND UPON THE AMOUNT BEING PAID FOUND BY SUCH COMMISSION OR JURY THE LAND SHOULD VEST ABSOLUTELY IN THE PETITIONER
THE WORLD HAD BETTER GO BACK TO BARBARISM TO THE DENS THE CAVES AND LAIRS OF SAVAGERY
HOW WILL YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE LYING SPIRITS THAT JEHOVAH SENT TO MISLEAD AHAB
NOW I ADMIT THAT ALL THESE MONSTERS WERE NATURALLY PRODUCED
I BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMENTATORS--WITH ADAM CLARK WHO THOUGHT THAT THE SERPENT SEDUCED OUR MOTHER EVE AND WAS IN FACT THE FATHER OF CAIN
CERES WAS THE GODDESS OF THE FIELDS--BACCHUS OF THE VINE
ANOTHER QUESTION
I READ PALEY'S EVIDENCES AND FOUND THAT THE EVIDENCE OF INGENUITY IN PRODUCING THE EVIL IN CONTRIVING THE HURTFUL WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE EVIDENCE TENDING TO SHOW THE USE OF INTELLIGENCE IN THE CREATION OF WHAT WE CALL GOOD
NO FOLLOWER OF CHRIST KNEW THE SHAPE OF THE EARTH
BUT WHEN RELIGION WAS CONSIDERED THE END OF LIFE INSTEAD OF A MEANS OF HAPPINESS IT OVERSHADOWED ALL OTHER INTERESTS AND BECAME THE DESTROYER OF MANKIND
THIS IS JUSTICE WHEN IT BLOSSOMS IN MERCY
IT HAS BEEN CALCULATED THAT FOR YEARS AT LEAST 400,000 AFRICANS WERE EITHER KILLED OR ENSLAVED ANNUALLY
THE TWIGS AND LEAVES MAY DIFFER BUT THE TRUNK IS THE SAME
TO LOVE THE TRUTH THUS PERCEIVED IS MENTAL VIRTUE--INTELLECTUAL PURITY
HIS CRIME REMAINS THE SAME
PROBABLY NO TWO OF ITS READERS HAVE AGREED AS TO ITS MEANING
THE MAN AT THE TOP FEARS TO FALL
HE REACHES TO EVERY COUNTRY AND TAKES WHAT HE WANTS
BY EXPERIENCE BY EXPERIMENT POSSIBLY BY ACCIDENT MAN FOUND THAT SOME DISEASES COULD BE CURED BY NATURAL MEANS
BE GENEROUS BECAUSE IT IS BETTER FOR YOU
BUT THE CHRISTIANS OF TO-DAY ADMIT THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES CHRISTIANS DID BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF COUNTLESS DEVILS
MORE THAN ANY AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE INVENTIONS OF HER MECHANICS
NOW JUST NOW INFAMOUS--SOMETIMES WISE--GENERALLY FOOLISH
GO BACK OF ALL LIFE THAT WE NOW KNOW--BACK OF ALL THE FLYING LIZARDS THE ARMORED MONSTERS THE HISSING SERPENTS THE WINGED AND FANGED HORRORS--BACK TO THE LAURENTIAN ROCKS--TO THE EOZOON THE FIRST OF LIVING THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND--BACK OF ALL MOUNTAINS SEAS AND RIVERS--BACK TO THE FIRST INCRUSTATION OF THE MOLTEN WORLD--BACK OF WAVE OF FIRE AND ROBE OF FLAME--BACK TO THE TIME WHEN ALL THE SUBSTANCE OF THE EARTH BLAZED IN THE GLOWING SUN WITH ALL THE STARS THAT WHEEL ABOUT THE CENTRAL FIRE
THE COMMON PEOPLE THE CLERGY AND THE NOBILITY
HE COULD PAINT A PICTURE WITH WORDS
THIS EXEMPTION HAS THUS FAR DONE NO HARM TO THE CREDITOR CLASS
DRIVEN TO MADNESS BY THE PROSPECT OF ULTIMATE DEFEAT THE ENEMIES OF LIGHT PERSECUTED WITH REDOUBLED FURY
WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF JOHN WORTH
WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD DEPENDS UPON THE MEN WHO WALK IN THE FRESH FURROWS AND THROUGH THE RUSTLING CORN UPON THOSE WHOSE FACES ARE RADIANT WITH THE GLARE OF FURNACES UPON THE DELVERS IN DARK MINES THE WORKERS IN SHOPS UPON THOSE WHO GIVE TO THE WINTRY AIR THE RINGING MUSIC OF THE AXE AND UPON THOSE WHO WRESTLE WITH THE WILD WAVES OF THE RAGING SEA
IT SACRIFICES THE KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN THE PRESENT TO THE FUTURE THIS ACTUAL WORLD TO THE SHADOWY NEXT
IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO-CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
THE WISE THE REALLY HONEST AND INTELLIGENT ARE NOT SWAYED OR GOVERNED BY NUMBERS--BY MAJORITIES
ON ALL OTHER SUBJECTS HE HAS LIBERTY--AND IN ALL OTHER DIRECTIONS HE IS URGED TO STUDY AND THINK
WHY THEN I ASK SHOULD WE PRAISE HIM
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THE WHOLE HISTORY OF MANKIND A PRAYER HAS BEEN ANSWERED
WAS THE ANGEL WHO TOLD JOSEPH WHO THE FATHER OF CHRIST WAS A PERSONIFICATION
NO ONE WISHES TO DESTROY CHURCHES OR CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS
THE ORBITS OF THE STARS WERE TRACED AND MEN BECAME CITIZENS OF THE UNIVERSE
MAN IS A SOCIAL BEING
THAT SOULS HAD BEEN BREATHED INTO MAN BY JEHOVAH
WITH HIM AN UTTERANCE IS WORTH THE TRUTH THE REASON IT CONTAINS WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD TO THE AUTHOR
AS MAN BECAME CIVILIZED AS HE BECAME MERCIFUL HE BEGAN TO LOVE JUSTICE AND AS HIS MIND EXPANDED HIS IDEAL BECAME PURER NOBLER AND SO HIS GOD BECAME MORE MERCIFUL MORE LOVING
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE CANDID
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT
IN THE SAME CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD THAT CHRIST HEALED THOSE WHICH WERE POSSESSED OF DEVILS AND THOSE WHICH WERE LUNATIC AND THOSE THAT HAD THE PALSY FROM THIS IT IS EVIDENT THAT A DISTINCTION WAS MADE BETWEEN THOSE POSSESSED WITH DEVILS AND THOSE WHOSE MINDS WERE AFFECTED AND THOSE WHO WERE AFFLICTED WITH DISEASES
CAN ANY FARMER MECHANIC OR SCIENTIST FIND IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ONE USEFUL FACT
FOR MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS MAN HAS ENDEAVORED TO REFORM HIS FELLOW-MEN BY IMPRISONMENT TORTURE MUTILATION AND DEATH AND YET THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD SHOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND IS NO REFORMING POWER IN PUNISHMENT
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN IN EVERY HEART WILL BE THE PERFUME OF PITY'S SACRED FLOWER
ABOVE ALL THE THEOLOGIANS OF THE WORLD ABOVE THE MAKERS OF CREEDS ABOVE THE FOUNDERS OF RELIGIONS ROSE THIS SERENE UNSELFISH AND INTREPID MAN
THEY TOLD THE ASTRONOMERS THAT THE SUN AND MOON WERE NOT ACTUALLY BUT ONLY APPARENTLY STOPPED
VIII
VIII
VIII
VIII
VIII
VIII
TAKING THE GROUND THAT IT WAS NOT PRODUCED HERE WAS NOT PRODUCED BY MAN THEY THEN IMAGINE A GOD FROM WHOM IT CAME
THEIR MOANS MADE ALL THE MUSIC THEY WISHED TO HEAR
ANAESTHETICS WERE DISCOVERED AND PAIN WAS LOST IN SLEEP
THEY ARE CANDID AND SINCERE
WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO REJECT THE CONTRADICTORY AND ABSURD AND ACCEPT THE REASONABLE AND GOOD
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DEVELOP CHARACTER
THEY DENOUNCE HONEST MEN WHO EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS AS BLASPHEMERS AND DO WHAT THEY CAN TO CLOSE THEIR MOUTHS
THERE THE SUPERNATURAL DOES NOT EXIST
WHAT HAVE THE WORLDLY DONE
WHAT HAVE THE WORLDLY DONE
AND WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT FOR THIS PURPOSE WAS THE SON OF GOD MANIFESTED THAT HE MAY DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEVIL NO DEVIL--NO CHRIST
EVERY MAN OUGHT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS ABILITY TO INCREASE THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND FOR THE REASON THAT THAT WILL INCREASE HIS OWN
BUT HOPE FOR THE FUTURE DEPENDS UPON THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE PRESENT
THESE IDEAS ABOUT GODS AND DEVILS OFTEN CHANGED BECAUSE IN THE DAYS OF SOCRATES A DEMON WAS NOT A DEVIL BUT A GUARDIAN ANGEL
THE MAN WHO FINDS A TRUTH LIGHTS A TORCH
THEY CALLED ITS CRUELTIES JUSTICE--ITS ABSURDITIES MYSTERIES--ITS MIRACLES FACTS AND THE IDIOTIC PASSAGES WERE REGARDED AS PROFOUNDLY SPIRITUAL
HE HAS DESERTED WIFE AND CHILD
YOU ARE RETREATING STILL
ALL OLD--ALL BORROWED PIECED AND PATCHED
THEN THE GOOD WILL BE HAPPY AND THE BAD WILL BE DAMNED
THEN ANOTHER THINKER GAVE HIS THOUGHT--WAS MURDERED--ANOTHER TOMB BECAME SACRED--ANOTHER STEP WAS TAKEN IN ADVANCE
THAT THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN GOOD GOVERNMENT
ON THE BROW OF A FINDER OF A FACT THE LAUREL IS PLACED
THEY KNEW THAT GOD COMMENCED TO CREATE ONE MONDAY MORNING FOUR THOUSAND AND FOUR YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
DESCARTES ANNOUNCED TO THE WORLD THE SUBLIME TRUTH THAT THE UNIVERSE IS GOVERNED BY LAW
IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY ABSURDLY IDIOTIC
OUR DUTY IS TO PREACH AND YOURS IS TO BELIEVE WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
FOR CENTURIES IT HATED THE USEFUL
ACCORDING TO PALEY THERE CAN BE NO DESIGN WITHOUT A DESIGNER--BUT THERE CAN BE A DESIGNER WITHOUT A DESIGN
IN THIS LIFE MAN NEEDS RAIMENT AND ROOF FOOD AND FUEL
THEY TRAMPLED BENEATH THEIR FEET THE GREAT ARMY OF HUMAN VERMIN THAT HAD LIVED UPON THEIR LABOR
WHY DID HE ALLOW MILLIONS OF MOTHERS TO BE ROBBED OF THEIR BABES
THE CELL THEORY WAS ADVANCED AND EMBRYOLOGY WAS STUDIED
DID ANYBODY OFFER HIM THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD
NO MATTER HOW CRUEL THE LAWS YOUR HEART MUST APPROVE THEM ALL THIS IS WHAT THE CHURCH CALLS THE LIBERTY OF THOUGHT
WE DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
WE HAD EDWARDS ON THE WILL IN WHICH THE REVEREND AUTHOR SHOWS THAT NECESSITY HAS NO EFFECT ON ACCOUNTABILITY--AND THAT WHEN GOD CREATES A HUMAN BEING AND AT THE SAME TIME DETERMINES AND DECREES EXACTLY WHAT THAT BEING SHALL DO AND BE THE HUMAN BEING IS RESPONSIBLE AND GOD IN HIS JUSTICE AND MERCY HAS THE RIGHT TO TORTURE THE SOUL OF THAT HUMAN BEING FOREVER
GOD THE FATHER
VOLTAIRE WHO FILLED THE FLESH OF PRIESTS WITH THE BARBED AND POISONED ARROWS OF HIS WIT AND MADE THE PIOUS JUGGLERS WHO CURSED HIM IN PUBLIC LAUGH AT THEMSELVES IN PRIVATE
EVERYWHERE THE WEAK THE INSIGNIFICANT LIVING ON THE STRONG--THE INFERIOR ON THE SUPERIOR--THE HIGHEST FOOD FOR THE LOWEST--MAN SACRIFICED FOR THE SAKE OF MICROBES
ANOTHER THING--MATTER CANNOT EXIST APART FROM FORCE
THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TRIAL THE CRUCIFIXION AND ASCENSION OF CHRIST DO NOT AGREE
AND THE INNOCENT BEING SACRIFICED MUST BE GREAT ENOUGH TO ATONE FOR THE WORLD
THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY LUCKY IN KILLING GIANTS THAT HE KILLED ONE IN FRANCE WHO USED TO EAT SEVERAL PEOPLE EVERY DAY AND THAT THIS GIANT WAS CLOTHED WITH GARMENTS MADE ENTIRELY OF THE BEARDS OF KINGS THAT HE HAD KILLED AND EATEN
HE KNEW WHEN HE MADE THEM THAT THEY WOULD BE FOOD FOR THE SWORD
WHEN THEY BECOME MEN AND WOMEN THEY TELL FATHER'S STORY OF HAVING SEEN THE DEVIL TO THEIR CHILDREN AND SO THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN NOT ONLY BELIEVE BUT THINK THEY KNOW THAT THEIR FATHER--THEIR GRANDFATHER--ACTUALLY SAW A DEVIL
IF THEY ARE SUBJECT TO DEATH WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AFTER DEATH
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS THE FATHER OF CHRIST
AS LATE AS THE MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY EVERY INFANT THAT WAS BAPTIZED WAS BY THAT CEREMONY FREED FROM A DEVIL
HE CANNOT HOPE OR FEAR
TO PHANTOMS WE ARE DEAF AND BLIND BUT WE EXTEND THE HELPING HAND TO THE DISTRESSED
NOTHING FOR COMETS OR ECLIPSES AND HAVE NO BELIEF IN GOOD OR EVIL SPIRITS IN GODS OR DEVILS
THAT THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH BELIEVED AS SINCERELY IN THE DEVIL AND HIS DEMONS AS IN GOD AND HIS ANGELS
BY WHOSE PERMISSION DID THEY ENTER INTO THE MAN
IF YOU REPENT AND BELIEVE ON JESUS CHRIST THEN HIS GOODNESS WILL BE IMPUTED TO YOU AND THE PENALTY OF THE LAW SO FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED WILL BE SATISFIED BY THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST
THE MAN WHO HAS A GOOD BUSINESS AND WHO CAN MAKE A REASONABLE LIVING AND LAY ASIDE SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE WHO CAN EDUCATE HIS CHILDREN AND CAN LEAVE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE WOLF OF WANT FROM THE DOOR OF THOSE HE LOVES OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
HOW TO REFORM MANKIND
HOW TO REFORM MANKIND
AT THAT TIME ALL NATIONS WERE IN THE DARKNESS OF SUPERSTITION
WE ARE ALL AT THEIR MERCY AND YET THEY DO NOT COMMIT MORE CRIMES ACCORDING TO NUMBER THAN THE RICH
YOU WILL ASK WHAT HAS PRODUCED THIS WONDERFUL CHANGE IN ONLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT THEY SAID GOD IS THE JUDGE--BUT IN THE NEW CHRIST IS THE MERCIFUL
HOW WAS THAT MADE
HE ALSO TAUGHT THAT ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE OUTSIDE CIRCLE OF LAND THE FIRMAMENT OR SKY WAS FASTENED THAT IT WAS MADE OF SOME SOLID MATERIAL AND TURNED OVER THE WORLD LIKE AN IMMENSE KETTLE
THAT WORD IS A COILED SERPENT IN THE MOTHER'S BREAST THAT LIFTS ITS FANGED HEAD AND HISSES IN HER EAR:--"YOUR CHILD WILL BE THE FUEL OF ETERNAL FIRE THAT WORD BLOTS FROM THE FIRMAMENT THE STAR OF HOPE AND LEAVES THE HEAVENS BLACK
MATTHEW SAYS THAT JOSEPH'S FATHER WAS JACOB
BESIDES THIS THE CLERGY WERE A LITTLE BELOW PAR SO MUCH SO THAT QUEEN ELIZABETH ISSUED AN ORDER THAT NO CLERGYMAN SHOULD PRESUME TO MARRY A SERVANT GIRL WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF HER MASTER OR MISTRESS
I SEE THEM GIVE THEIR TOIL THEIR WEALTH TO ROBE THE PRIESTS TO BUILD THE VAULTED ROOFS THE SPACIOUS AISLES THE GLITTERING DOMES
THAT THE CREATOR DEMANDS CERTAIN THINGS AND THAT THE PERSON WHO COMPLIES WITH THESE DEMANDS IS RELIGIOUS
JOHN WESLEY WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT TO GIVE UP A BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT WAS TO GIVE UP THE BIBLE
TO THE BAR OF HIS CONSCIENCE HIS REASON HE SUMMONED THE BARBARISM AND THE BARBARIANS OF HIS TIME
THEY COULD NOT HELP AND THE BLESSED VIRGIN DID NOT HEAR
THAT WORD FILLS ALL THE FUTURE WITH THE SHRIEKS OF THE DAMNED
NO MAN EVER HAD A SHARPER SWORD--A BETTER SHIELD
CAN THE DEAD BE RAISED
THEY SHOUTED
IN THOSE DAYS READING AND WRITING WERE CONSIDERED VERY DANGEROUS ARTS AND ANY LAYMAN WHO HAD ACQUIRED THE ART OF READING WAS SUSPECTED OF BEING A HERETIC OR A WIZARD
LOOKING BACK OVER THE LONG AND DEVIOUS ROADS THAT LIE BETWEEN THE BARBARISM OF THE PAST AND THE CIVILIZATION OF TO-DAY THINKING OF THE CENTURIES THAT ROLLED LIKE WAVES BETWEEN THESE DISTANT SHORES WE CAN FORM SOME IDEA OF WHAT OUR FATHERS SUFFERED--OF THE MISTAKES THEY MADE--SOME IDEA OF THEIR IGNORANCE THEIR STUPIDITY--AND SOME IDEA OF THEIR SENSE THEIR GOODNESS THEIR HEROISM
CAPRICE IS KING
AT LAST THE PEOPLE BELIEVED BOTH AND THE OLD ADAGE WAS VERIFIED THAT WHEN THIEVES FALL OUT HONEST MEN GET THEIR DUES
I SEE THEM ALL--THE ASSYRIANS CHANTING THE PRAISES OF ASSHUR AND ISHTAR--THE HINDUS WORSHIPING BRAHMA VISHNU AND DRAUPADI THE WHITEARMED--THE CHALDEANS SACRIFICING TO BEL AND HEA--THE EGYPTIANS BOWING TO PTAH AND RA OSIRIS AND ISIS--THE MEDES PLACATING THE STORM WORSHIPING THE FIRE--THE BABYLONIANS SUPPLICATING BEL AND MORODACH--I SEE THEM ALL BY THE EUPHRATES THE TIGRIS THE GANGES AND THE NILE
THEY HATED FREEDOM OF MIND AND OF BODY
UPON THESE SUBJECTS NOTHING NEW IS PRODUCED OR ANTICIPATED AND YET THE DISCUSSION IS MAINTAINED BY THE REPETITION OF THE OLD ARGUMENTS
THE CHILD SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO INVESTIGATE NOT TO BELIEVE
THEY ARE REGARDED AS IMMORAL
THEY MELTED VIRTUE'S SNOW IN PASSION'S FIRE AND IN CUNNING WAYS ENTRAPPED AND SMIRCHED THE INNOCENT AND GOOD
LYELL THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT SAYS THAT IT MUST HAVE REQUIRED TO CAUSE THE CHANGES THAT WE KNOW AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MILLION YEARS
THE WHOLE CATHOLIC WORLD FROM THE LOWEST LAYMAN TO THE HIGHEST PRIEST BELIEVED IN DEVILS
TELL YOUR CONGREGATIONS THAT MOSES WAS NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE PENTATEUCH
WE KNOW THAT IT CORRUPTED OUR PEOPLE THAT IT HAS DRENCHED OUR LAND IN FRATERNAL BLOOD THAT IT HAS CLAD OUR COUNTRY IN MOURNING FOR THE LOSS OF 300,000 OF HER BRAVEST SONS
WE READ THE BIBLE UNDER THE SCOWL AND THREAT OF GOD
NO WOMAN SHOULD BY LAW OR BY PUBLIC OPINION BE FORCED TO LIVE WITH A MAN WHOM SHE ABHORS
AND THIS BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT WAS SO INTENSE THAT TO EXPRESS A DOUBT UPON THE SUBJECT WAS TO BE SUSPECTED AND PROBABLY EXECUTED
WHAT REMEDY THEN IS THERE
I THANK ALL WHO HAVE ADORNED ENRICHED AND ENNOBLED LIFE--ALL WHO HAVE CREATED THE GREAT THE NOBLE THE HEROIC AND ARTISTIC IDEALS
HE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT OF THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF FORCE
NEITHER THE DISEASES NOR THE DEFORMITIES OF THE MIND OR BODY SHOULD BE PERPETUATED
BEING FROM ETERNITY HE WAS NOT PRODUCED
OF COURSE THE CHRISTIANS OF TO-DAY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DEVILS OF THE HINDUS EGYPTIANS PERSIANS OR BABYLONIANS EXISTED
IN MANY OF OUR SMALL TOWNS--TOWNS OF THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE--WILL BE FOUND FOUR OR FIVE CHURCHES SOMETIMES MORE
WE KNOW THAT ALL THEIR EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN
IT TAUGHT THE GEOLOGY OF MOSES--THE ASTRONOMY OF JOSHUA AND ELIJAH
IT TAUGHT THE WICKEDNESS OF WEALTH THE BLESSEDNESS OF POVERTY
THIS IS THE DEVIL'S WORK THROUGH ALL THE AGES PEOPLE HAVE MISTAKEN DREAMS AND VISIONS OF FEAR FOR REALITIES
HAVE WE A TRUE COPY OF THE BIBLE THAT WAS IN THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM--THE ONE SENT TO VESPASIAN
HOW DID THEY GET IT AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH IT
THE ATLAS OF CHRISTIANITY IS THE DEVIL
CEREMONIES PRAYERS AND INSPIRED BOOKS MIRACLES SPECIAL PROVIDENCE AND DIVINE INTERFERENCE ALL BELONG TO THE SUPERNATURAL AND FORM NO PART OF REAL RELIGION
THAT BY OUR LAWS CHILDREN WERE SOLD FROM THE ARMS OF MOTHERS WIVES SOLD FROM THEIR HUSBANDS
WHILE WE ARE WORKING AT OUR TRADES AND PROFESSIONS WE WANT YOU TO STUDY AND ON SUNDAY TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND OUT LET SUCH A MINISTER TAKE FOR A SERIES OF SERMONS THE HISTORY THE PHILOSOPHY THE ART AND THE GENIUS OF THE GREEKS
WITH THE MEANS WE NOW HAVE OF TRANSPORTATION THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR POOR PEOPLE BEING HUDDLED IN FESTERING MASSES IN THE VILE FILTHY AND LOATHSOME PARTS OF CITIES WHERE POVERTY BREEDS RAGS AND THE RAGS BREED DISEASES
AND WHY
HE WHO SAYS THAT HE BELIEVES AND DOES THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE REWARD CORRUPTS HIS SOUL
THE TWO ARE ALWAYS FOUND TOGETHER SUPPORTED BY PRECISELY THE SAME ARGUMENTS AND ATTENDED BY THE SAME INFAMOUS ACTS OF CRUELTY
YET WE ARE TOLD THAT HE IS INFINITELY WISE
THAT IS THE TROUBLE
DO THEY OCCUPY SPACE
AND YET CHRISTIANS IMPLORE THEIR GOD NOT TO DO WRONG
IN THIS WAY HIS MIND IS POISONED PARALYZED
THERE MUST BE FREEDOM IN RELIGION FOR WITHOUT FREEDOM THERE CAN BE NO REAL RELIGION
EVERY MAN SHOULD BE TRUE TO HIMSELF--TRUE TO THE INWARD LIGHT
WHO AND WHAT IS HE
HE WILL LENGTHEN ENNOBLE AND ENRICH LIFE
AND HE ONLY IS A WISE MAN WHO MAKES HIMSELF AND OTHERS HAPPY
THIS SURPLUS HAS ERECTED ALL THE PALACES AND TEMPLES ALL THE GALLERIES OF ART HAS GIVEN TO US ALL THE BOOKS IN WHICH WE CONVERSE AS IT WERE WITH THE DEAD KINGS OF THE HUMAN RACE AND HAS SUPPLIED US WITH ALL THERE IS OF ELEGANCE OF BEAUTY AND OF REFINED HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD
THERE WAS BUT ONE SUCH BEING--GOD
THE TRINITY THE NEW TESTAMENT INFORMS US THAT CHRIST WAS THE SON OF JOSEPH AND THE SON OF GOD AND THAT MARY WAS HIS MOTHER
MANY SUCH CAVES AND HUNDREDS OF SUCH TOOLS AND OF SUCH BONES HAVE BEEN FOUND
HE IT WAS WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE WHO MADE ALL SUBSTANCE ALL FORCE ALL LIFE FROM NOTHING
THE MIRACULOUS THE SUPERNATURAL WAS NOT ONLY BELIEVED IN BUT WAS ALWAYS EXPECTED
SCHOOLS WHERE THE HEART WAS HARDENED AND THE BRAIN SHRIVELED
THE VERY HAIRS OF YOUR HEAD ARE ALL NUMBERED CHRIST SEEMED TO RELY ABSOLUTELY ON THE PROTECTION OF GOD UNTIL THE DARKNESS OF DEATH GATHERED ABOUT HIM AND THEN HE CRIED
THEY WERE TRANSFERRED WITH LAND AND WOMEN WERE OFTEN SEEN ASSISTING CATTLE TO PULL THE PLOUGH AND YET PEOPLE HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO SAY THAT BLACK SLAVERY IS RIGHT BECAUSE THE BLACKS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SLAVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
THINK OF THE FEAR OF DEATH OF INFINITE WRATH OF EVERLASTING REVENGE IN THE PRISONS OF FIRE OF AN ETERNITY OF THIRST OF ENDLESS REGRET OF THE SOBS AND SIGHS THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF ETERNAL PAIN
HE DOES NOT KNOW
THEY CRUSHED THEIR FEET IN WHAT THEY CALLED IRON BOOTS
WHY SHOULD WE THANK NATURE
THE TORCHES THAT TRUTH HAD LIGHTED THAT COURAGE CARRIED AND HELD ALOFT WERE EXTINGUISHED WITH BLOOD
LOOK AT THE WOMEN IN THIS TOWN SEWING FOR A LIVING MAKING CLOAKS FOR LESS THAN FORTY-FIVE CENTS THAT SELL FOR $45
WE CAN CIVILIZE OUR FELLOW-MEN
JESUS REBUKED THE DEVIL AND THE DEVIL DEPARTED OUT OF HIM AND THE BOY WAS CURED
IT WAS ALSO BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS IN FACT THE KING OF ALL AND THAT THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF THIS GOD
THEY HAVE CHANGED THE FRIGHTENED THE ENSLAVED THE KNEELING THE PROSTRATE INTO MEN AND WOMEN--CLOTHED THEM IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS AND MADE THEM TRULY FREE
EVERY ONE IS MENTALLY DISHONEST
THEY FOUND THAT MOST OF THE ROCKS HAD BEEN DEPOSITED AND STRATIFIED IN THE WATER--ROCKS 70,000 FEET IN THICKNESS
ALL THESE BELONGED TO THE MIRACULOUS
THEY WHO CLAIM TO OWN THEIR FELLOW-MEN LOOK DOWN INTO THE PIT AND FORGET THE JUSTICE THAT SHOULD RULE THE WORLD I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH EPICURUS WHO TAUGHT THE RELIGION OF USEFULNESS OF TEMPERANCE OF COURAGE AND WISDOM AND WHO SAID
HE KNOWS THAT ALL THESE THINGS OCCUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REFERENCE TO THE HUMAN RACE
NO CLEAN CLOTHES NO MUSIC IF YOU EXCEPT A JEW'S-HARP NO ICE WATER NO SKATES NO CARRIAGES BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A DECENT ROAD IN ALL HIS DOMINIONS
THEY HAVE MADE LIFE WORTH LIVING
THEY SHOULD HAVE INTELLECTUAL COURAGE
EVERY BELIEVER IN THE INSPIRED BOOK IS A SLAVE WHO DRIVES REASON FROM HER THRONE AND IN HER STEAD CROWNS FEAR
RELIGION DOES NOT CONSIST IN BELIEVING WITHOUT EVIDENCE OR AGAINST EVIDENCE
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT ANGELS AND GHOSTS--THAT DEVILS AND GODS EXIST
YOU SEE EVERY SOUL IS A SCULPTOR THAT FASHIONS THE FEATURES AND IN THIS WAY REVEALS ITSELF
DO THEY STAY IN THE STOMACH OR BRAIN IN THE HEART OR LIVER
HE WAS PERFECTLY SINCERE AND WHAT HE SAID WAS KIND AND FAIR
AND SO IT IS WITH THE STUDENTS OF EVERY SCIENCE
POSSIBLY THE DROPPING OF A DISHCLOTH PROPHESIES THE COMING OF COMPANY BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THAT BY NO POSSIBILITY CAN HE DESTROY A FORCE
THE TELEGRAPH BY FRANKLIN AND MORSE
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THOSE DAYS NATIONS CARRIED ON WAR AS AN END NOT AS A MEANS
MILLIONS OF MEN HAVE WASTED THEIR LIVES IN THE STUDY OF THIS BOOK--IN TRYING TO HARMONIZE CONTRADICTIONS AND TO EXPLAIN THE OBSCURE AND SEEMINGLY ABSURD
I SHALL DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN TO HASTEN THE DAY WHEN THIS EARTH SHALL BE COVERED WITH HOMES AND WHEN BY COUNTLESS FIRESIDES SHALL SIT THE HAPPY AND THE LOVING FAMILIES OF THE WORLD
HE NEED NOT KILL SOMETHING
NOTHING SHOULD BE TAUGHT AS TRUE THAT CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED
THEY HAVE GIVEN US MATHEMATICS IN THE HIGHER FORMS BY MEANS OF WHICH WE MEASURE THE ASTRONOMICAL SPACES THE DISTANCES TO STARS THE VELOCITY AT WHICH THE HEAVENLY BODIES MOVE THEIR DENSITY AND WEIGHT AND BY WHICH THE MARINER NAVIGATES THE WASTE AND TRACKLESS SEAS
WILL HE EVER BECOME CIVILIZED ENOUGH NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NECESSITIES OF THE POOR OF THE HUNGER AND RAGS AND WANT OF POVERTY
NOAH CROSSED THE STRIP OF WATER AND LANDED ON THE CENTRAL PIECE WHERE WE NOW ARE
HE IS THE CENSOR WHO PASSES ON EVERY SERMON
UNDERSTAND ME DISTINCTLY
SO THE STORY OF JOSEPH THE ENSLAVEMENT OF THE HEBREWS BY THE EGYPTIANS THE STORY OF MOSES IN THE BULLRUSHES THE BURNING BUSH THE TURNING OF STICKS INTO SERPENTS OF WATER INTO BLOOD THE MIRACULOUS CREATION OF FROGS THE KILLING OF CATTLE WITH HAIL AND CHANGING DUST INTO LICE ALL MUST BE GIVEN UP
WE MUST DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS AND HAVE CHARITY--AND WE WILL HAVE IT WHENEVER WE HAVE THE PHILOSOPHY THAT ALL MEN ARE AS THEY MUST BE AND THAT INTELLIGENCE AND KINDNESS ARE THE ONLY LEVERS CAPABLE OF RAISING MANKIND
NOW THE THEOLOGIANS SAY THAT HELL AND HEAVEN ARE NOT PLACES BUT STATES OF MIND--CONDITIONS
DELIVERED BEFORE THE CONGRESS OF THE AMERICAN SECULAR UNION AT CHICKERING HALL NEW YORK NOV
TAKE PHYSIC POMP
THE MAN OF STRAW IS THEIR MASTER
INSANITY WAS NOT A DISEASE
THEY LIKE COMPANY
THE WONDERFUL POWER OF STEAM WAS MADE KNOWN TO THE WORLD BY WATTS AND BY FULTON
AND THERE WAS WAR IN HEAVEN
WHILE ALL THE MIRACLES OF ART THEIR WEALTH BESTOW UPON THE THRILLED AND JOYOUS BRAIN AND PRESENT RAPTURES BANISH PAIN
TO DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN
THIS IS THE FLESH OF THE GODDESS THEY DRANK WINE AND CRIED
IN VAIN THE STEEPLES RISE--IN VAIN THE PRAYERS ASCEND
IN A COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA WHERE EVERY MOUTH IS A BASTILE AND EVERY TONGUE A CONVICT THERE MAY BE SOME EXCUSE
NO HOPE IN HELL

THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF THIS BEING IS FOUND IN GENESIS AND IN THAT ACCOUNT HE IS CALLED THE SERPENT HE IS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN MORE SUBTLE THAN ANY BEAST OF THE FIELD
THOSE WHO SAY THAT SLAVERY IS BETTER THAN LIBERTY--PROMISES ARE NOT EVIDENCE--HORACE GREELEY AND THE COLD STOVE--III
WITH THEM HYPOCRISY IS RESPECTABLE AND CANDOR INFAMOUS
EVERY ORTHODOX CREED IS A CHAIN A DUNGEON
WITH THE FLINT TOOLS MAN HAD SPLIT THE BONES OF THESE BEASTS THAT HE MIGHT SECURE THE MARROW FOR FOOD
BEYOND THE LIMITS OF OUR THOUGHTS
THEN AFTER HAVING DISPOSED OF THEM THEY CAN WAGE A WAR AGAINST THE STARS AND AGAINST JEHOVAH HIMSELF FOR HAVING FURNISHED EVIDENCE AGAINST THE TRUTHFULNESS OF HIS BOOK
I AM THROUGH
THEY KNEW IT WAS THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD AND SO BELIEVING SO KNOWING--AS THEY THOUGHT--THEY BECAME INSANE
OUR INSPIRED BOOKS CONSTITUTE WHAT WE CALL THE BIBLE THE MAN WHO READS THIS INSPIRED BOOK LOOKING FOR CONTRADICTIONS MISTAKES AND INTERPOLATIONS IMPERILS THE SALVATION OF HIS SOUL
YOU HAVE GIVEN UP THE GEOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY OF THE BIBLE
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS IN HER KEEPING THE THREE SKULLS THAT BELONGED TO THESE WISE MEN BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE CHURCH OBTAINED THESE RELICS NOR EXACTLY HOW THEIR GENUINENESS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED
IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY YOURSELF IF YOU ARE TRULY CIVILIZED YOU WANT OTHERS TO BE HAPPY
SEVEN UP WAS THEN UNKNOWN TO THE WORLD
IF A MAN COMES TO YOUR DOOR WITH THE SMALLPOX YOU CANNOT LET HIM IN YOU CANNOT KILL HIM
IN THE IMAGINATION OF A WRITER WHO HAD MORE PATRIOTISM THAN INTELLIGENCE AND WHO WROTE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF TRUTH BUT FOR THE GLORY OF THE JEWS
HE KNOWS IF HE LISTENS TO REASON THAT TRUTH IS NOT DANGEROUS AND THAT ERROR IS
PUFENDORF SAID THAT SLAVERY WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY CONTRACT
IT HAS GIVEN US A SELFISH HEAVEN AND A HELL OF INFINITE REVENGE
INSPIRED BOOKS--MYSTERIES ADDED TO BY THE EXPLANATIONS OF THEOLOGIANS--THE INSPIRED BIBLE THE GREATEST CURSE OF CHRISTENDOM--VIII
SEVENTY SOULS WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT AND IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS INCREASED TO THREE MILLIONS
IT IS THIS DEVIL THAT RAISES THE STORM THAT WRECKS THE HOMES OF JOB'S CHILDREN
SHE HATH A DEVIL A MAN UTTERS A TERRIBLE CRY
THEY HAVE DRENCHED THE ALTARS WITH BLOOD
WHAT LIGHT IS TO THE EYES--WHAT AIR IS TO THE LUNGS--WHAT LOVE IS TO THE HEART LIBERTY IS TO THE SOUL OF MAN
AND ALL THIS TO CONVINCE THEM OF THE TRUTH
YOU CANNOT REFORM THESE PEOPLE WITH PREACH AND CREED
CREDULITY IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE ARE THE VIRTUES OF SLAVES AND THE ENSLAVERS OF THE FREE
HE CREATES HIS OWN ENEMIES AND PLOTS AGAINST HIMSELF
EVERYBODY WAS KNOWN
THE DEVIL I BELIEVE WAS UNTOUCHED HE PROBABLY HAVING AN INKLING OF LUTHER'S INTENTION MADE A SUCCESSFUL DODGE
THEY WERE THE CREATORS OF CIVILIZATION--THE FOUNDERS OF FREE STATES--THE SAVIORS OF LIBERTY--THE DESTROYERS OF SUPERSTITION AND THE GREAT CAPTAINS IN THE ARMY OF PROGRESS
IF IT CANNOT FRIGHTEN IT WILL BRIBE
HE WANTS THE TRUTH
AND WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ME FOR INSTANCE TO-NIGHT IF I HAD INVITED YOU HERE--NOBODY HAD CHARGED YOU ANYTHING BUT YOU HAD BEEN INVITED--AND WHEN YOU GOT HERE YOU HAD FOUND ONE MAN PRETENDING TO OCCUPY A HUNDRED SEATS ANOTHER FIFTY AND ANOTHER SEVENTY-FIVE AND THEREUPON YOU WERE COMPELLED TO STAND UP--WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF THE INVITATION
THE CHURCH ATTEMPTED THE IMPOSSIBLE
HAS AN ALLEGORY AN APPETITE OR IS A POEM A CANNIBAL
IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD THAT PEOPLE BROUGHT UNTO CHRIST MANY THAT WERE POSSESSED WITH DEVILS AND THAT HE CAST OUT THE SPIRITS WITH HIS WORD
THEY SHOULD RESPECT THE MOULD AND MOSS OF ANTIQUITY
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IF PEOPLE COULD BOTTLE THE AIR THEY WOULD
THE PRIESTS WERE THE ENEMIES OF THOUGHT OF INVESTIGATION
THEY BECAME INTERESTED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD--IN THE GREAT PANORAMA OF NATURE
IF WE SAY THAT THE BOOK IS INSPIRED THEN WE MUST ADMIT THAT CHRIST REALLY SAID ALL THE THINGS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY THE VARIOUS WRITERS
IT IS A WORD WORTHY OF THE LIPS OF A GOD
IN OTHER WORDS ADAM WAS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN THE EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMERS MADE THESE REPRESENTATIONS
LUKE SAYS THAT IT TOOK PLACE WHEN CYRENIUS WAS GOVERNOR
THE OLD LADY WHO SAID THERE MUST BE A DEVIL ELSE HOW COULD THEY MAKE PICTURES THAT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE HIM REASONED LIKE A TRAINED THEOLOGIAN--LIKE A DOCTOR OF DIVINITY
SURGERY BECAME A SCIENCE
THEY HAVE READ A FEW LEAVES OF THE GREAT VOLUME--DECIPHERED SOME OF THE RECORDS WRITTEN ON STONE BY THE TIRELESS HANDS OF TIME IN THE DIM PAST
WHERE DID EVE GET HER LANGUAGE
WE DO NOT BOW BEFORE A GUESS A VAGUE UNKNOWN
ART THOU COME TO DESTROY US
WE LOVE NO PHANTOMS OF THE SKIES BUT LIVING FLESH WITH PASSION'S SOFT AND SOULFUL EYES LIPS WARM AND FRESH AND CHEEKS WITH HEALTH'S RED FLAG UNFURLED THE BREATHING ANGELS OF THIS WORLD
FOR MANY CENTURIES FREE SPEECH HAS BEEN AN INSULT TO GOD
WAS HE WISE AND GOOD WITHOUT HIS WISH OR WILL
IT IS NOT
BUT IF THERE IS THE SMALLEST SEED OF GOOD IN ANY HUMAN HEART LET KINDNESS FALL UPON IT UNTIL IT GROWS AND IN THAT WAY I KNOW AND SO DO YOU THAT THE WORLD WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER DAY BY DAY
THE INCUBI WERE MALE ANGELS AND THE SUCCUBI WERE FEMALE ANGELS AND ACCORDING TO THE BELIEF OF THAT TIME NOTHING SO ATTRACTED THE INCUBI AS THE BEAUTIFUL HAIR OF WOMEN AND FOR THIS REASON PAUL SAID THAT WOMEN SHOULD KEEP THEIR HEADS COVERED
FOR MANY CENTURIES HIS ONLY CONCEPTION OF MORALITY WAS THE IDEA OF OBEDIENCE NOT TO FACTS AS THEY EXIST IN NATURE BUT TO THE SUPPOSED COMMAND OF SOME BEING SUPERIOR TO NATURE
THIS IS THE FIRST LECTURE EVER DELIVERED BY MR INGERSOLL
THE FACT THAT THE EXPLANATION WAS AS HARD TO BELIEVE AS THE MIRACLE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE DEVOUT CRUDEN
CYRENIUS WAS NOT APPOINTED GOVERNOR UNTIL AFTER THE DEATH OF HEROD AND THE TAXING COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE UNTIL TEN YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED BIRTH OF CHRIST
WHAT HAS CHANGED THE CONDITION OF GREAT BRITAIN
DID THEY TEACH THE GOSPEL OF SELF-RELIANCE OF INDUSTRY--OF HONEST EFFORT
THAT AT HIS GRAVE THE ALL-DEVOURING MONSTER WAS BAFFLED AND BEATEN FOREVER
TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME I READ CALVIN'S INSTITUTES A BOOK CALCULATED TO PRODUCE IN ANY NATURAL MIND CONSIDERABLE RESPECT FOR THE DEVIL
I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO RECOUNT THE HORRORS AND TORTURES OF THE INQUISITION
THAT HE SHOULD TEMPT AND CORRUPT THE FATHER AND MOTHER OF THE HUMAN RACE
THOU ART MY BELOVED SON IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED AND IMMEDIATELY THE SPIRIT DRIVETH HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS WHY THE HOLY GHOST SHOULD HAND CHRIST OVER TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF THE DEVIL IS NOT EXPLAINED
IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT HEROD HAD BEEN DEAD TEN YEARS BEFORE THE TAXING UNDER CYRENIUS
THE PEOPLE WERE AGAIN FILLED WITH WONDER AND CONSTERNATION
HER IMAGINATION IS TOUCHED AND THE VOICE SEEMS TO UTTER WORDS
WHAT HE IS HE WILL BE THERE CAN BE NO CHANGE
IN A HUNDRED OTHER WAYS THEY ARE DIVIDED
THERE IS BUT ONE HOPE
THE CHURCHES SAID TO THE UNBELIEVERS THE HERETICS
LOVE IS AND MUST BE FREE
THAT WHATSOEVER THEY WERE THAT SHOULD READ THE SCRIPTURES IN THE MOTHER TONGUE THEY SHOULD FORFEIT LAND CATTLE BODY LIFE AND GOODS FROM THEIR HEIRS FOREVER AND SO BE CONDEMNED FOR HERETICS TO GOD ENEMIES TO THE CROWN AND MOST ARRANT TRAITORS TO THE LAND THE NEXT YEAR AFTER THIS LAW WAS IN FORCE IN ONE DAY THIRTY-NINE WERE HANGED FOR ITS VIOLATION AND THEIR BODIES AFTERWARD BURNED
AND THE TIME WILL COME WHEN IN THE BRAIN OF EVERY HUMAN BEING WILL BE THE CLIMATE OF INTELLECTUAL HOSPITALITY
IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR MEN ARE SEEKING FOR THE TRUTH--FOR THE FACTS
WAS GOD AMBITIOUS TO OBTAIN A VICTORY OVER SATAN
DEFEAT DISASTER DISGRACE COULD NOT CONQUER HER LOVE
SPRINGING FROM THE SAME FOUNTAIN THAT A MAN IS NOT THE OWNER OF HIS SOUL IS THE DOCTRINE THAT HE IS NOT THE OWNER OF HIS BODY
DID THEY GIVE US EVEN A HINT AS TO ANY USEFUL THING
POSSIBLY JOHN HAD HIS DOUBTS
WHEN THAT TIME COMES THE PRISON WALLS WILL FALL THE DUNGEONS WILL BE FLOODED WITH LIGHT AND THE SHADOW OF THE SCAFFOLD WILL CEASE TO CURSE THE EARTH
YOU SEND HIM TO THE PENITENTIARY
IT IS FAR BETTER TO HAVE NO HEAVEN THAN TO HAVE HEAVEN AND HELL
HOW FOOLISH IS INFINITE WISDOM
IT HAS SPRINKLED WATER ON BABES WHEN THEY WERE NAMED
THIS SATISFIES THE BRAIN AND HEART
THE PERSIANS TURNED THIS AROUND AND WITH THEM THE ASURAS WERE GOOD AND THE DEVAS BAD
LET ME SHOW YOU THE CONDITION OF ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE SIGNS AND ECLIPSES THE COMETS AND THE FALLING STARS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE SAME IF NOT A HUMAN BEING HAD BEEN UPON THE EARTH
WHEN EVIL COMES WE DO NOT CURSE OR THANK BECAUSE IT IS NO WORSE
THE TRUE MAN WHO ASKS ANOTHER TO BELIEVE OFFERS EVIDENCE
HE DID NOT RISE ABOVE ALL THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS DAY
LONG BEFORE OUR BIBLE WAS KNOWN OTHER NATIONS HAD THEIR SACRED BOOKS
THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS--WHAT IS THIS POWER?--THE ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD IS A POWER WORKING FOR GOOD?--LOVE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE HIGHER VIRTUES--IV
LUTHER ONE OF THE GRAND MEN OF THE WORLD CAST IN THE HEROIC MOULD ALTHOUGH HE GAVE UTTERANCE TO THE FOLLOWING SUBLIME SENTIMENT
TRUE RELIGION IS A SUBORDINATION OF THE PASSIONS AND INTERESTS TO THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE INTELLECT
THEY HAVE BEEN WORSHIPED IN MANY LANDS--BY MANY NATIONS THAT HAVE PASSED TO DEATH AND DUST
I WISH TO GO A STEP FURTHER
THEY HAVE EXISTED FROM ETERNITY
IN THE OLDEN TIMES IN BARBARIC LIFE IT WAS A SIMPLE THING TO GET A LIVING
THE CHRISTIANS SAID THAT GOD HAD THE RIGHT TO DESTROY THEM BECAUSE HE CREATED THEM
THEIR LIVES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED IN THE ACQUISITION OF THE USELESS OR OF THE ALMOST USELESS
UP TO THIS TIME I HAD READ NOTHING AGAINST OUR BLESSED RELIGION EXCEPT WHAT I HAD FOUND IN BURNS BYRON AND SHELLEY
THEY PREACH AGAINST EXCURSIONS AND PICNICS--AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK THE WOODS AND THE SEA THE SHADOWS AND THE WAVES
TO DO RIGHT SHOULD ALWAYS BE DICTATED BY THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SELFISHNESS AND THE MOST PERFECT GENEROSITY
WITCHCRAFT THE NEXT FACT TO WHICH I CALL YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT DURING THE MIDDLE AGES THE PEOPLE THE WHOLE PEOPLE THE LEARNED AND THE IGNORANT THE MASTERS AND THE SLAVES THE CLERGY THE LAWYERS DOCTORS AND STATESMEN ALL BELIEVED IN WITCHCRAFT--IN THE EVIL EYE AND THAT THE DEVIL ENTERED INTO PEOPLE INTO ANIMALS AND EVEN INTO INSECTS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS DARK DESIGNS
CAN WE BELIEVE THAT GOD THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE LEARNED THE TRADE OF A CARPENTER IN PALESTINE THAT HE GATHERED A FEW DISCIPLES ABOUT HIM AND AFTER TEACHING FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS SUFFERED HIMSELF TO BE CRUCIFIED BY A FEW IGNORANT AND PIOUS JEWS
AND WE NOW KNOW THAT IN THE DRIFT PERIOD MAN WAS THE COMPANION OF THESE EXTINCT MONSTERS
AND GOD MADE THE FIRMAMENT AND DIVIDED THE WATERS WHICH WERE UNDER THE FIRMAMENT FROM THE WATERS WHICH WERE ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT
SUPERSTITION MADE ALL THE POPES CARDINALS BISHOPS AND PRIESTS ALL THE MONKS AND NUNS THE BEGGING FRIARS AND THE FILTHY SAINTS ALL THE PREACHERS AND EXHORTERS ALL THE CALLED AND SET APART SUPERSTITION MADE MEN FALL UPON THEIR KNEES BEFORE BEASTS AND STONES CAUSED THEM TO WORSHIP SNAKES AND TREES AND INSANE PHANTOMS OF THE AIR BEGUILED THEM OF THEIR GOLD AND TOIL AND MADE THEM SHED THEIR CHILDREN'S BLOOD AND GIVE THEIR BABES TO FLAMES
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
O THOU GREAT AND UNSCRUPULOUS GOD WAS NEARER RIGHT THAN HE KNEW
ACCORDING TO THEIR SCHEME OF SALVATION IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT CHRIST SHOULD BE KILLED--NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BE BETRAYED AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR JUDAS ALL THE WORLD INCLUDING CHRIST'S MOTHER AND THE PART OF CHRIST THAT WAS HUMAN WOULD HAVE GONE TO HELL
ITS GOD IS NOT ONLY IGNORANT BUT INFINITELY CRUEL
WHY DOES GOD ALLOW THESE DEVILS TO ENJOY THEMSELVES AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS IGNORANT CHILDREN
IN OTHER BOOKS WERE FOUND THE THOUGHTS AND DREAMS OF MEN BUT IN THE BIBLE WERE THE SACRED TRUTHS OF GOD
THAT SOME OF THE BOOKS ARE NOT INSPIRED
TRUTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF FREE SPEECH--HAS ALWAYS ASKED TO BE INVESTIGATED--HAS ALWAYS LONGED TO BE KNOWN AND UNDERSTOOD
TO HER IT BECOMES A VOICE
THESE REVEREND GENTLEMEN SHOULD ATTACK THE ASTRONOMERS
JESUS CAST OUT THE DEVIL AND THE DUMB MAN SPAKE
EVERY CHURCH IS AN ORGANIZED BEGGAR
BELIEF--ETERNAL PAIN--NO HOPE IN HELL PITY IN HEAVEN OR MERCY IN THE HEART OF GOD--VIII
NATURE ORIGINATES NOURISHES PRESERVES AND DESTROYS
WHERE ARE HEAVEN AND HELL?--PRAYERS NEVER ANSWERED--THE DOCTRINE OF DESIGN--WHY WORSHIP OUR IGNORANCE?--WOULD GOD LEAD US INTO TEMPTATION?--PRESIDENT MCKINLEY'S THANKS GIVING FOR THE SANTIAGO VICTORY--VI
IN THE REAL CHOIR IS ALL THE THRILLING MUSIC OF THE WORLD AND IN THE STAR-LIT AISLES HAVE BEEN AND ARE THE GRANDEST SOULS OF EVERY LAND AND CLIME
AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT ALL THE ARGUMENTS ON ALL SIDES OF THESE DIFFERENCES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF TIMES
IT SEEMS THAT HE WAS NOT LED BY THE DEVIL INTO THE WILDERNESS BUT BY THE SPIRIT
THE TEMPLE WAS DESTROYED AND AT THE REQUEST OF JOSEPHUS THE HOLY BIBLE WAS SENT TO VESPASIAN THE EMPEROR AT ROME
HOW IS IT ESTABLISHED THAT CHRIST WAS THE SON OF GOD
THE PRIESTS CRIED TO THE PEOPLE
I SEE THE EARTHQUAKES DEVOUR THE VOLCANOES OVERWHELM THE CYCLONES WRECK THE FLOODS DESTROY AND THE LIGHTNINGS KILL
WHEN THE HOLY WATER WAS APPLIED THE PRIEST SAID
I AM NOT AFRAID OF THEM
FOLLOW ME THE MAN SAID
MANY A NIGHT HAVE I SEEN THE SPARKS FLY AND HEARD THE STORIES THAT WERE TOLD
THERE IS NO DANGER OF DEMORALIZING THE WORLD THROUGH DIVORCE
SOME ACTORS DISAPPEAR AND OTHERS COME AND AGAIN THE SCENE SHIFTS
AND IT WAS SO AND GOD CALLED THE FIRMAMENT HEAVEN
TO LIVE A MORAL AND HONEST LIFE--TO KEEP YOUR CONTRACTS TO TAKE CARE OF WIFE AND CHILD--TO MAKE A HAPPY HOME--TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN A PATRIOT A JUST AND THOUGHTFUL MAN WAS SIMPLY A RESPECTABLE WAY OF GOING TO HELL
AND LET US HOPE THAT THIS POOR EARTH ON WHICH WE LIVE MAY BE A PERFECT WORLD--A WORLD WITHOUT A CRIME--WITHOUT A TEAR
THAT ANGELS MINISTERED UNTO CHRIST AND THAT COUNTLESS ANGELS WILL ACCOMPANY THE SAVIOR WHEN HE COMES TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE WORLD
THESE MEN WERE THE REAL DESTROYERS OF THE SACRED STORY
AT LAST CHRIST SAID
THEY REDDENED THE EARTH WITH THE BLOOD OF THEIR MASTERS
HE CANNOT CREATE FORCE
ANARCHY IS THE REACTION FROM TYRANNY
IN OUR DAY JEHOVAH HAS BEEN OUTGROWN
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE EXCEPT THE ASSERTIONS OF IGNORANT PRIESTS
THAT THOSE WHO USE THEM ARE FOR THE MOST PART DISHONEST AND THAT THOSE WHO RELY ON THEM ARE ALMOST IDIOTIC
SHALL WE THANK THEM FOR THE HELL OF THE FUTURE
IGNORANCE BEING DARKNESS WHAT WE NEED IS INTELLECTUAL LIGHT
ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN WINGLESS DEVILS IN THE PRISON OF FLAME
GREEKS ENSLAVED ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS THOSE CAPTURED IN WAR
KEEP THE DEVILS OUT OF CHILDREN
WE DO NOT ENSLAVE OURSELVES
THEN COMES THE STORY OF THE TWO MEN POSSESSED WITH DEVILS WHO CAME FROM THE TOMBS AND WERE EXCEEDING FIERCE
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS WORLD AT LAST SO THAT A MAN COULD DIE AND NOT FEEL THAT HE LEFT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN A PREY TO THE GREED THE AVARICE OR THE CRUELTIES OF MANKIND
THE JEWS BELIEVING THAT JEHOVAH WAS GOD HAD VERY LITTLE BUSINESS FOR A DEVIL
HE CREATES CANCERS TO FEED UPON THEIR FLESH--THEIR QUIVERING NERVES--SERPENTS TO FILL THEIR VEINS WITH VENOM,--BEASTS TO CRUNCH THEIR BONES--TO LAP THEIR BLOOD
IT WAS PRODUCED BY DEMONS
BLESSED ARE THE MERCIFUL
IN THE TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTER AN ACCOUNT OF THE BETRAYAL OF CHRIST BY JUDAS IS GIVEN IN THESE WORDS
THE PEOPLE SHOULD MEET THERE AT ANY TIME THEY DESIRE
WITCHCRAFT
LUKE ALSO SAYS THAT THE CHILD GREW AND WAXED STRONG IN SPIRIT AND THAT HIS PARENTS WENT EVERY YEAR TO JERUSALEM
DARWIN WITH HIS ORIGIN OF SPECIES HIS THEORIES ABOUT NATURAL SELECTION THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT SHED A FLOOD OF LIGHT UPON THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE
NO ONE BELIEVED THAT HONEST ERROR COULD BE INNOCENT
THE FIELDS BEING POORLY CULTIVATED PRODUCED BUT LITTLE AT THE BEST
IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE CHURCH HAS MADE MEN AND WOMEN FORGIVING
WE DID NOT GET OUR INFORMATION FROM INSPIRED BOOKS
THE ONLY DESIRE IS THAT THEY SHALL ACCOMPLISH SUBSTANTIAL GOOD FOR THE WORLD
THOUSANDS HAVE STUDIED HEBREW AND GREEK THAT THEY MIGHT READ THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT IN THE LANGUAGES IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN
NOT MEETING WITH THE SUCCESS THAT HE ANTICIPATED HE CHANGED HIS TACTICS AND COMMENCED A THEOLOGICAL DISCUSSION
THEY ATTACKED THE ASTRONOMERS AS THOUGH THEY WERE CRIMINALS--THE GEOLOGISTS AS THOUGH THEY WERE ASSASSINS
JESUS REBUKED THIS DEVIL AND SAID TO HIM
THEY INVENTED MOVABLE TYPE TAUGHT US THE ART OF PRINTING AND MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND TRANSMIT THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF THE WORLD
WE WATCH THE FLOW AND EBB OF LIFE AND DEATH--THE GREAT DRAMA THAT FOREVER HOLDS THE STAGE WHERE PLAYERS ACT THEIR PARTS AND DISAPPEAR
NOTHWITHSTANDING THE EXPERIENCE OF ANTIQUITY AS TO THE TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY BONDAGE WAS THE RULE AND LIBERTY THE EXCEPTION DURING THE MIDDLE AGES NOT ONLY BUT FOR AGES AFTERWARD
TRUTH IS SWORD AND SHIELD
THE FACTS NOW SHOW BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT ALL RELIGIONS CAME FROM SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME SOURCE--BUT THERE IS NOT AN ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIAN WHO WILL ADMIT THE FACTS
IT IS THE INFINITE OF MALICE HATRED AND REVENGE
THIS WAS AUTHORITY UNTIL THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY COLUMBUS
GRADUALLY HIS CONFIDENCE INCREASED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NATURAL AND BEGAN TO DECREASE IN CHARMS AND AMULETS THE WAR WAS WAGED FOR MANY CENTURIES BUT THE NATURAL GAINED THE VICTORY
BELIEF WITHOUT EVIDENCE IS NOT RELIGION
THE RUSH OF THE SHIP THE SCREAM OF THE LOCOMOTIVE AND THE ELECTRIC FLASH HAVE FRIGHTENED THE MONSTERS OF IGNORANCE FROM THE WORLD AND HAVE LEFT NOTHING ABOVE US BUT THE HEAVEN'S ETERNAL BLUE FILLED WITH GLITTERING PLANETS WHEELING THROUGH IMMENSITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW
COMPROMISE IS IMPOSSIBLE
BUT AS IT WAS UNCERTAIN HOW HIGH THE WATER WOULD RISE THIS IDEA WAS ABANDONED
AND ALL THIS COULD BE DONE TO MAKE A NATION OF HOUSEHOLDERS A NATION OF LAND-OWNERS A NATION OF HOME-BUILDERS
THIS SHOWS HIS IMPARTIALITY
YET GOD GAVE THEM ANOTHER TRIAL KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE
I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF YOUR MINDS THE OLD NONSENSE OF FREE MORAL AGENCY AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE CHARITY FOR THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
HE RETRACES HIS STEPS AND TAKES THE RIGHT HAND ROAD AND REACHES THE PLACE DESIRED
MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT SLAVES ARE PURER TRUER THAN THE FREE WHO BELIEVE THAT FEAR IS A SAFER GUIDE THAN KNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD WHO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF OTHERS AND THAT IGNORANCE IS THE SOIL IN WHICH THE PERFECT PERFUMED FLOWER OF VIRTUE GROWS WILL WITH PROTESTING HANDS HIDE THEIR SHOCKED FACES
HOW THE HEART WOULD THRILL AND THROB TO KNOW THAT CHRIST WAS THE CONQUEROR OF DEATH
THEY WERE MIRACLES MISTAKES AND MYTHS IGNORANT AND UNTRUE ABSURD IMPOSSIBLE IMMORAL UNNATURAL CRUEL CHILDISH SAVAGE
IN CHRONICLES WE ARE TOLD THAT SATAN PROVOKED DAVID TO NUMBER ISRAEL
I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU THAT EVERY WRONG IS A VIPER THAT WILL SOONER OR LATER STRIKE WITH POISONED FANGS THE BOSOM THAT NOURISHES IT
ALLOWING TEN HOURS FOR A DAY THAT IS FOR A WORKING DAY THE WASTE OF WAR IS AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT IS TO SAY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MINUTE
IN MARK WE ARE TOLD WHO THIS SPIRIT WAS
THOUGHT IS A LADDER--A PROCESS BY WHICH WE REACH A CONCLUSION
IF THE SERPENT DID NOT IN FACT EXIST HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ADAM AND EVE EXISTED
DID THEY SAY ONE WORD IN FAVOR OF ANY SCIENCE OF ANY ART
THAT HE COULD BE RELIEVED IN MANY INSTANCES OF PAIN BY CERTAIN KINDS OF LEAVES OR BARK
THE STORY IS INCONSISTENT WITH ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EVERY STAR SHINING IN THE HEAVENS TESTIFIES THAT ITS AUTHOR WAS AN UNINSPIRED BARBARIAN
SO WE MUST REMEMBER THAT DAY BY DAY LABOR IS BECOMING INTELLIGENT
THE INTEREST ON THIS SUM IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THE COST OF EMPLOYING PERSONS WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO SEEK THE AID OF THE SUPERNATURAL AND TO MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY IS CERTAINLY AS MUCH MORE
OTHER GODS AND OTHER RELIGIONS--DOGMAS MYTHS AND SYMBOLS OF CHRISTIANITY OLDER THAN OUR ERA--VIII
ACCORDING TO CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIANS THE DEVIL HAS ALWAYS DONE HIS UTMOST TO GAIN POSSESSION OF THE SOULS OF MEN
THE MISTAKES WERE NATURAL THE EXAGGERATIONS WERE MOSTLY UNCONSCIOUS AND THE LIES WERE GENERALLY HONEST
ONE INSTANCE IS RELATED WHERE A MAN WAS ATTACKED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A WOLF
THE MEN WHO HAVE EXPLORED THE HEAVENS AND TRACED THE ORBITS OF THE STARS--WHO HAVE READ THE STORY OF THE WORLD IN MOUNTAIN RANGE AND BILLOWED SEA
MY WIFE SPUN AND WOVE AND WORKED EVERY MOMENT
WHEN HE REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS HE TELLS HIS STORY AND OF COURSE THE CHILDREN BELIEVE
IN THIS IT IS ASSERTED THAT THE WALLS OF A CITY FELL DOWN IN ANSWER TO PRAYER
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION WAS THE INAUGURATION OF A NEW ERA
THEY WORKED FOR THEMSELVES FOR WIFE AND CHILD AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL
AND SO WE LOVE AND HOPE AND DREAM THAT IN DEATH'S SKY THERE IS A GLEAM
THEY ABHOR THE COURAGE OF MANLY MEN
EPILEPTICS WERE POSSESSED BY DEVILS
THE POOR MOTHER HOLDING HER DEAD BABE IN HER ARMS LOVINGLY WHISPERED HIS NAME
DID CHRIST WISH TO BE CONVICTED
AT FIRST THEY FLATLY DENIED THE FACTS--THEN THEY BELITTLED THEM--THEN THEY HARMONIZED THEM--THEN THEY DENIED THAT THEY HAD DENIED THEM
INTO IGNORANT LIES
THEY MUST GIVE UP THE FLOOD AND THE TOWER OF BABEL AND THE CONFUSION OF TONGUES
BEAM AFTER BEAM OF LIGHT PENETRATED THE DARKNESS
FOR WE HAVE SEEN HIS STAR IN THE EAST AND ARE COME TO WORSHIP HIM MATTHEW DOES NOT TELL US WHO THESE WISE MEN WERE FROM WHAT COUNTRY THEY CAME TO WHAT RACE THEY BELONGED
TO LOVE GOD TO PRACTICE SELF-DENIAL TO OVERCOME DESIRE TO DESPISE WEALTH TO HATE PROSPERITY TO DESERT WIFE AND CHILDREN TO LIVE ON ROOTS AND BERRIES TO REPEAT PRAYERS TO WEAR RAGS TO LIVE IN FILTH AND DRIVE LOVE FROM THE HEART--THESE FOR CENTURIES WERE THE HIGHEST AND MOST PERFECT VIRTUES AND THOSE WHO PRACTICED THEM WERE SAINTS
PROBABLY THE ARCHITECT WAS INSPIRED
SCIENCE COULD NOT PROPERLY SPEAKING EXIST
IN SOME INVISIBLE BEING WHO PRODUCES EFFECTS WITHOUT CAUSES AND CAUSES WITHOUT EFFECTS
IN ZACHARIAH WE ARE TOLD THAT JOSHUA STOOD BEFORE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD AND THAT SATAN STOOD AT HIS RIGHT HAND TO RESIST HIM AND THAT THE LORD REBUKED SATAN
WE HAD POLLOK'S COURSE OF TIME WITH ITS WORM THAT NEVER DIES ITS QUENCHLESS FLAMES ITS ENDLESS PANGS ITS LEERING DEVILS AND ITS GLOATING GOD
DO WE PROVE THAT THIS GOD IS GOOD BECAUSE HE SENDS THE CYCLONE THAT WRECKS VILLAGES AND COVERS THE FIELDS WITH THE MANGLED BODIES OF FATHERS MOTHERS AND BABES
TO THEM ALL MYSTERIES HAVE BEEN REVEALED EXCEPT THE MYSTERY OF THINGS THAT TOUCH THE SENSES OF A LIVING MAN
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE CHILD THEY WORSHIPED HIM,--GAVE HIM GIFTS AND BEING WARNED BY GOD IN A DREAM THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY WITHOUT CALLING ON HEROD
THIS MAKES THE FINDER AND PUBLISHER OF TRUTH A PUBLIC BENEFACTOR
OUT OF THESE WORDS SHE CONSTRUCTS A MESSAGE OR A WARNING FROM THE UNSEEN WORLD
CREDULITY CEREMONY WORSHIP SACRIFICE AND PRAYER TAKE THE PLACE OF HONEST WORK OF INVESTIGATION OF INTELLECTUAL EFFORT OF OBSERVATION OF EXPERIENCE
HE SAW THEM SLOWLY DEVOUR THE LITTLE THAT THEY HAD AND SAW THEM WHEN THE DAYS OF HUNGER CAME--SAW THEM SLOWLY WASTE AWAY SAW THEIR HUNGRY SUNKEN EYES HEARD THEIR PRAYERS SAW THEM DEVOUR THE MISERABLE ANIMALS THAT THEY HAD SAW FATHERS AND MOTHERS INSANE WITH HUNGER KILL AND EAT THEIR SHRIVELED BABES AND YET THE HEAVEN ABOVE THEM WAS AS BRASS AND THE EARTH BENEATH AS IRON AND HE SENT NO RAIN
THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS AND NATURALISTS WHO HAVE FILLED THE WORLD WITH LIGHT
THE FOOLISH THE INFAMOUS WILL BE THROWN AWAY
IS ALL THAT IS SAID ABOUT GOD ALLEGORY AND POETIC OR MYTHICAL
WHEN THE LOVING THE TENDER EAT A CRUST WHILE THE INFAMOUS SIT AT BANQUETS
FOR CENTURIES ITALY WAS ENRICHED WITH THE GOLD OF THE FAITHFUL
THE ATOMS COMPOSING THEIR BODIES ENTER INTO NEW COMBINATIONS INTO NEW FORMS INTO WHEAT AND CORN INTO THE FLESH OF ANIMALS AND INTO THE BODIES OF OTHER MEN
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO MORALLY WE WERE A LOW PEOPLE--BEFORE WE ABOLISHED SLAVERY--BUT NOW WHEN THERE IS NO CHAIN EXCEPT THAT OF CUSTOM WHEN EVERY MAN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IS THE GRANDEST GOVERNMENT OF THE EARTH
I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE CAUSES OF THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY BOTH OF BODY AND MIND
ALL OF THESE SUN-GODS WERE BORN AT THE WINTER SOLSTICE--ON CHRISTMAS
AND GOD SAID
WHILE IN ONE CASE A SOUL IS REWARDED FOR THE VIRTUES OF ANOTHER IN THE OTHER CASE A SOUL IS DAMNED FOR THE SINS OF ANOTHER
THEY CHISELED STATUES PAINTED PICTURES AND WITCHED THE WORLD WITH FORM AND COLOR
IF THE WORDS ARE GOOD SHE HAS HEARD AN ANGEL
YET NEARLY ALL OF THE NATIONS OF EUROPE ENGAGED IN THE SLAVE-TRADE LEGALIZED IT PROTECTED IT FOSTERED THE PRACTICE AND VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN ACTS THE BARE RECITAL OF WHICH IS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE HEART STAND STILL
WATT AND DESCARTES FULTON AND MONTAIGNE STEPHENSON AND KEPLER CROMPTON AND COMTE FRANKLIN AND VOLTAIRE MORSE AND BUCKLE DRAPER AND SPENCER AND HUNDREDS MORE THAT I COULD MENTION
EVEN IF THE GOVERNOR SHOULD DIE IN THE PLACE OF THE CRIMINAL IT WOULD BE NO BETTER
IT WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO KNOW THAT ANGELS HOVER IN THE AIR
DO NOT THINK THAT WHITE SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
EVERY MAN SHOULD BE MENTALLY HONEST
IT INDUCED MILLIONS OF PURE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GIRLS TO RENOUNCE THE JOYS OF LIFE--TO TAKE THE VEIL WOVEN OF NIGHT AND DEATH TO WEAR THE HABILIMENTS OF THE DEAD--MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE THE BRIDES OF CHRIST
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HONESTY WEARS A RAG AND RASCALITY A ROBE
A FEW YEARS AGO AT A REVIVAL A FINE BUXOM GIRL WAS CONVERTED BORN AGAIN IN HER EXCITEMENT SHE CRIED I'M MARRIED TO CHRIST--I'M MARRIED TO CHRIST IN HER DELIRIUM SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND THE NECK OF AN OLD MAN AND AGAIN CRIED I'M MARRIED TO CHRIST THE OLD MAN WHO HAPPENED TO BE A KIND OF SKEPTIC GENTLY REMOVED HER HANDS SAYING AT THE SAME TIME
WE WALK ACCORDING TO OUR LIGHT PURSUE THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HONOR'S STAINLESS HEIGHT CARELESS OF WRATH OR CURSE OF GOD OR PRIESTLY SPITE LONGING TO KNOW AND DO THE RIGHT
BAPTISM IS FAR OLDER THAN CHRISTIANITY--THAN JUDAISM
WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME WHILE THERE ARE MANY PASSAGES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT SHOWING CHRIST TO HAVE BEEN FORGIVING AND TENDER THERE ARE MANY OTHERS SHOWING THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE
MATTER AND FORCE WERE NOT CREATED
THEN I TOOK ANOTHER STEP
THEY WERE INSANE
WE ALL KNOW THE BEAUTIFUL HYMN COMMENCING WITH THE CHEERFUL LINE
ALL BEGGARS TEACH THAT OTHERS SHOULD GIVE
HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM MURDERED
THEY COULD MOVE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY MILES A DAY
CONSEQUENTLY WE KNOW THAT ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE JEHOVAH DID NOTHING ON THE SECOND DAY
TELL THEM THAT DEUTERONOMY WAS NOT WRITTEN UNTIL ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THIS SOMEBODY WAS AND DO NOT KNOW FROM WHOM HE RECEIVED HIS INFORMATION
TO TEACH THE ALPHABET IS TO INAUGURATE REVOLUTION
MR PREACHER I SUPPOSE YOU NOTICED MY FARM
THE PRISONS ARE FULL THE COURTS ARE CROWDED THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW ARE BUSY AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO MATERIAL DECREASE IN CRIME
HE KNOWS THAT CHRIST HIMSELF WAS A BELIEVER IN THE DEVIL IN EVIL SPIRITS AND THAT HIS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS WAS CASTING OUT DEVILS FROM THE BODIES OF MEN AND WOMEN
THE REAL FOUNDER OF THE PRESENT SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE WAS A GERMAN LEIBNITZ--A CONTEMPORARY OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DROPPING OF THE CLOTH AND THE ANTICIPATED EFFECTS
I SEE THEIR GODS GROW OLD AND WEAK INFIRM AND FAINT
DID THEY INCREASE THE SUM OF KNOWLEDGE
WOULD IT BE FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THAT STATE TO HAVE A FEW LANDLORDS AND FOUR OR FIVE MILLIONS OF SERFS
IT WOULD SEEM FROM THIS THAT THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY SPIRITUAL BEINGS BUT ORGANIZED ON A PHYSICAL BASIS
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE CHURCH WAS FOUNDED AND HAS BEEN PROTECTED BY GOD THAT ALL THE POPES AND CARDINALS ALL THE BISHOPS PRIESTS AND MONKS ALL THE MINISTERS AND EXHORTERS WERE SELECTED AND SET APART--ALL SANCTIFIED AND ENLIGHTENED BY THE INFINITE GOD--THAT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES WERE INSPIRED BY THE SAME BEING AND THAT ALL THE ORTHODOX CREEDS WERE REALLY MADE BY HIM
HE WAS HINDERED BY IGNORANCE BY FEAR BY MISTAKES AND HE ADVANCED ONLY AS HE FOUND THE TRUTH--THE ABSOLUTE FACTS
BUT SAYS THE PREJUDICED PRIEST THE MALICIOUS MINISTER YOU TAKE AWAY A FUTURE LIFE I AM NOT TRYING TO DESTROY ANOTHER WORLD BUT I AM ENDEAVORING TO PREVENT THE THEOLOGIANS FROM DESTROYING THIS
INFLUENCE OF BIRTH IN DETERMINING RELIGIOUS BELIEF--SCOTCH IRISH ENGLISH AND AMERICANS INHERIT THEIR FAITH--RELIGIONS OF NATIONS NOT SUDDENLY CHANGED--PEOPLE WHO KNEW--WHAT THEY WERE CERTAIN ABOUT--REVIVALS--CHARACTER OF SERMONS PREACHED--EFFECT OF CONVERSION--A VERMONT FARMER FOR WHOM PERDITION HAD NO TERRORS--THE MAN AND HIS DOG--BACKSLIDING AND RE-BIRTH--MINISTERS WHO WERE SINCERE--A FREE WILL BAPTIST ON THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS--II
WE HAVE RECEIVED NO INFORMATION FROM THE PARTIES WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ON THE SUBJECT
DO NOT BLAME THEM
DO RIGHT NOT TO DENY YOURSELF BUT BECAUSE YOU LOVE YOURSELF AND BECAUSE YOU LOVE OTHERS
NEITHER WAS THEIR PLACE FOUND ANY MORE IN HEAVEN
WE WANT NO TYRANT ON THE EARTH OR IN THE AIR
THEY ARE FULL OF MISTAKES AND CONTRADICTIONS
THAT FORCE CAN BE OVERCOME ONLY BY FORCE AND THAT THE WHOLE WORLD IS NATURAL
THEN CHANGING HIS TONE OF PITY TO ONE OF TRIUMPH--LEAPING FROM TEARS TO THE HEIGHTS OF EXULTATION--FROM DEFEAT TO VICTORY--HE DESCRIBED THE GLORIOUS COMPANY OF ANGELS WHO WITH WHITE AND OUTSPREAD WINGS CARRIED THE SOUL OF THE DESPISED PAUPER TO PARADISE--TO THE BOSOM OF ABRAHAM
MEN AND WOMEN WERE PUT IN THE PILLORY AND THEN PELTED WITH BRICK-BATS ROTTEN EGGS AND DEAD CATS BY THE RABBLE
THE RESULT WAS FREQUENT FAMINE AND CONSTANT SUFFERING
THEY PLUCKED OUT THEIR NAILS AND THEN INTO THE BLEEDING QUICK THRUST NEEDLES
HE HAD NOBILITY ENOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH--HE TOLD THE FATHER THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE PENITENTIARY
IN CAVES ONCE INHABITED BY MEN HAVE BEEN FOUND IMPLEMENTS OF FLINT AND THE BONES OF THESE EXTINCT ANIMALS
THINK OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS TO WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE YIELDED HAD NOBODY BEEN LOOKING
IN A FEW MOMENTS AFTERWARD THEY HEARD THE REPORT OF A PISTOL AND HE WAS DEAD
BUT THE WORLD IS CHANGING
NOW AND THEN SOME MINISTER PUTS A LITTLE SENSE IN HIS DISCOURSE--TRIES TO TAKE A FORWARD STEP
CAN WE ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE BY CEREMONY
I DO NOT INTEND IN WHAT I MAY SAY UPON THIS SUBJECT TO CARRY YOU BACK TO THE REMOTEST ANTIQUITY,--BACK TO ASIA THE CRADLE OF THE WORLD WHERE WE COULD STAND IN THE ASHES AND RUINS OF A CIVILIZATION SO OLD THAT HISTORY HAS NOT RECORDED EVEN ITS DECAY
THEY WERE EXAMINING THE FOSSILS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS--STUDYING THE FORMS OF ANIMALS--THEIR BONES AND MUSCLES--THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE AND FOOD--THE STRANGE MODIFICATIONS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD PASSED
THEY WERE NOT CLAD IN SACRED VESTMENTS AND TIARAS WERE NOT UPON THEIR BROWS
THEY SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THESE LIES THESE FRAUDS THE MIRACLES AND MISTAKES HAVE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS RULED ENSLAVED AND CORRUPTED THE HUMAN RACE
IT KNEW THE ROAD TO ETERNAL JOY THE WAY TO DEATH
IT IS SAID THAT WHEN THEY SAW JESUS THEY CRIED OUT
WHY DID HE CREATE HIM
WHY DID HE CREATE HIM
THE SCIENTISTS NEVER PERSECUTED NEVER IMPRISONED THEIR FELLOW-MEN
SATAN SOUGHT IN MANY WAYS TO SCANDALIZE THE CHURCH
I THANK THE PHILOSOPHERS THE THINKERS WHO TAUGHT US HOW TO USE OUR MINDS IN THE GREAT SEARCH FOR TRUTH
HE SHOULD BE INTELLECTUALLY HOSPITABLE
POVERTY DOES NOT FEEL AT HOME THERE AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE RICH AND POOR ARE KEPT APART EVEN BY THEIR RELIGION
HER CAPITAL IS GONE
PETER SAYS THAT HE BOUGHT A FIELD WITH THE MONEY
THE ADDITION IS EQUALLY PECULIAR IF WE ADD TWO TO ONE WE HAVE BUT ONE
POSSIBLY WHAT APOSTLES AND THEOLOGIANS CALL AN ANGEL A SCIENTIST KNOWS AS CARBONIC ACID GAS
OF COURSE I HAD HEARD THE MINISTERS SPEAK OF BLASPHEMERS OF INFIDEL WRETCHES OF SCOFFERS WHO LAUGHED AT HOLY THINGS
NOW THEY ARE NOT AS CRUEL
SOMETHING HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN OUR COUNTRY IN THAT DIRECTION AND PROBABLY IN EVERY STATE THERE IS A HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION
ANOTHER HISTORIAN OF ABOUT THE SAME PERIOD TELLS US THAT ONE OF THE POPES CUT OFF HIS HAND BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN KISSED BY AN IMPROPER PERSON AND THAT THE HAND WAS STILL IN THE LATERAN AT ROME WHERE IT HAD BEEN MIRACULOUSLY PRESERVED FROM CORRUPTION FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
THE CHURCH DECLARED THAT WOMAN MUST BEAR THE CURSE OF THE MERCIFUL JEHOVAH
THINK OF THE GOOD THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THIS VAST SUM OF MONEY
A DESIRE TO BE HAPPY HERE THEY REGARD AS WICKED AND WORLDLY--BUT A DESIRE TO BE HAPPY IN ANOTHER WORLD AS VIRTUOUS AND SPIRITUAL
WE WILL NOT WILLINGLY BE FOOLED BY FABLES NURSED
THEY SCORNED THE SUPERSTITIONS OF THE PAST NOT ONLY BUT THEY SCORNED THE PAST
THEY WERE LOGICAL
THE EARTH WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE A GLOBE NOT BY A POPE OR CARDINAL--NOT BY A COLLECTION OF CLERGYMEN--NOT BY THE CALLED OR THE SET APART BUT BY A SAILOR
DID THE EARTH EXIST BEFORE THE SUN
THE THEOLOGIAN INSISTS THAT HIS INCONCEIVABLE GOVERNS THE WORLD THAT IT OR HE OR THEY CAN BE INFLUENCED BY PRAYERS AND CEREMONIES THAT IT OR HE OR THEY PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT IT OR HE OR THEY HAS PRIESTS AND TEMPLES
INGERSOLL VOL
CAN WE AFFECT THE NATURE AND QUALITIES OF SUBSTANCE BY PRAYER
HE MUST FIND THE CONDITIONS OF HAPPINESS AND BECOME WISE ENOUGH TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEM
THEY ASK THAT THE ARGUMENTS OF THEIR OPPONENTS BE ANSWERED BY THE COURTS
CRIME MADE FACES AT VIRTUE AND HONESTY WAS AN OUTCAST BEGGAR
MOST PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT THE RICH ARE IN HEAVEN BUT AS A RULE IT IS ONLY A GILDED HELL
SHE RELIED ON THE SUPERNATURAL
I THANK THE THINKERS OF GREECE AND ROME ZENO AND EPICURUS CICERO AND LUCRETIUS
I NEVER SEE THE WORD LIBERTY WITHOUT SEEING A HALO OF GLORY AROUND IT
THERE CAN BE GOODNESS WITHOUT MUCH INTELLIGENCE--BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PERFECT INTELLIGENCE AND PERFECT GOODNESS MUST GO TOGETHER
WE ADD TO THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF THE WORLD AND IN THIS WAY AND IN THIS WAY ALONE CAN BE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE PROSPERITY AND CIVILIZATION OF THE RACE
THE OLD MORAL METHOD WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A FAILURE
THE CHURCH CANNOT GIVE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PRODUCE
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LAW SO THAT EVERY HOME TO A SMALL AMOUNT SHOULD BE FREE NOT ONLY FROM SALE FOR DEBTS BUT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY FREE FROM TAXATION SO THAT EVERY MAN COULD HAVE A HOME
WITHOUT DOUBT THE CONTRACT OF MARRIAGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THE MOST SACRED THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN MAKE
THE WORLD IS OUR WITNESS AND THE STARS TESTIFY FOR US
HE WAS DENOUNCED AS A CHILD OF THE DEVIL A DOG OF SATAN AS A MURDERER OF SOULS AS A CORRUPTER OF THE FAITH AND AS ONE WHO BY HIS DOCTRINES CRUCIFIED THE SAVIOR AFRESH
IN MECHANICS HE SEARCHED FOR PERPETUAL MOTION BELIEVING THAT HE BY SOME CURIOUS COMBINATIONS OF LEVERS COULD PRODUCE COULD CREATE A FORCE
HE HAS SWUNG-CENSERS AND BURNED INCENSE COUNTED BEADS AND SPRINKLED HIMSELF WITH HOLY WATER--SHUT HIS EYES CLASPED HIS HANDS--FALLEN UPON HIS KNEES AND GROVELED IN THE DUST--BUT THE GODS HAVE BEEN SILENT--SILENT AS STONES
NOT ONE IN TWENTY THOUSAND COULD READ OR WRITE
FOR THE FIRST TIME I WAS FREE
THE EUCHARIST WAS BORROWED FROM THE PAGANS
THE TENDEREST WORD IN OUR LANGUAGE IS MATERNITY
HE ALSO SAYS THAT SHEPHERDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE TOLD OF THE BIRTH BY AN ANGEL WITH WHOM WAS A MULTITUDE OF THE HEAVENLY HOST
THERE IS NO FORCE WITHOUT MATTER
WE CAN HAVE OUR DREAM
I MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRANTING DIVORCE TO A MAN AND TO A WOMAN AND FOR THIS REASON
SUCH IS THE JUSTICE OF GOD
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE PASSION THAN INTELLIGENCE MORE PASSION THAN CONSCIENCE MORE PASSION THAN REASON
EVERY HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INVESTIGATE TO THE EXTENT OF HIS DESIRE--HIS ABILITY
THE GREAT THINKERS DEMONSTRATED THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF FORCE AND MATTER--DEMONSTRATED THAT THE INDESTRUCTIBLE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CREATED
IN MARRIAGES IT HAS MADE GOD THE PARTY OF THE THIRD PART
BENEATH THE SUPERSTRUCTURE CAN BE FOUND NO FACT
IT TAUGHT THAT THE INSANE WERE INHABITED BY DEVILS
IF HE COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE BETRAYAL THEN CHRIST WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CRUCIFIED
IN THIS CONDITION THEY FLOCKED TO THE MOURNERS BENCH"--ASKED FOR THE PRAYERS OF THE FAITHFUL--HAD STRANGE FEELINGS PRAYED AND WEPT AND THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN BORN AGAIN THEN THEY WOULD TELL THEIR EXPERIENCE--HOW WICKED THEY HAD BEEN--HOW EVIL HAD BEEN THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR DESIRES AND HOW GOOD THEY HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
ALONG THE BANKS OF THE GANGES WANDERED THE ASURAS THE MOST POWERFUL OF EVIL SPIRITS
THEY WERE THE VICTIMS THE CONVICTS OF SUPERSTITION--PRISONERS IN THE PENITENTIARIES OF GOD
IT WAS ACCEPTED BY NEW ENGLAND AND IT POISONED THE SOULS AND RUINED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS
THE REAL SEARCHER AFTER TRUTH WILL NOT RECEIVE THE OLD BECAUSE IT IS OLD OR REJECT THE NEW BECAUSE IT IS NEW
BUT WHILE I AM COMING ANOTHER STEPPETH DOWN BEFORE ME JESUS SAITH UNTO HIM
THE MASTER FLOGGED HIS APPRENTICE THE PEDAGOGUE HIS SCHOLAR THE HUSBAND HIS WIFE
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SPIRIT OF ONE WHO SAID
MY ANSWER IS FOUND IN THE SAME CHAPTER
IF THESE CALAMITIES DID NOT HAPPEN WOULD WE SUSPECT THAT GOD CARED NOTHING FOR HUMAN BEINGS
LIBERTY TRIUMPHED
AT ANOTHER TIME A MONSTER CAME FROM THE SEA AND AFTER HAVING DEVOURED A GREAT MANY COMMON PEOPLE FINALLY SWALLOWED THE KING HIMSELF
ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE REVELATION AND THE CREED HE WILL NOT READ HE WILL NOT HEAR
COWPER WAS SINCERE
THIS GOD MUST BE IF HE EXISTS A PERSON--A CONSCIOUS BEING
IF WE ARE IMMORTAL IT IS A FACT IN NATURE AND THAT FACT DOES NOT DEPEND ON BIBLES OR CHRISTS OR PRIESTS OR CREEDS
LET US BE TRUE TO OURSELVES--TRUE TO THE FACTS WE KNOW AND LET US ABOVE ALL THINGS PRESERVE THE VERACITY OF OUR SOULS
IS THAT THE LAST WORD THAT CIVILIZATION HAS TO SAY
WE ARE TOLD THAT ALL WHO BELIEVE IN THIS SCHEME OF REDEMPTION AND HAVE FAITH IN THE REDEEMER WILL BE REWARDED WITH ETERNAL JOY
FALLS TO THE GROUND
NO GOD WHO RESCUES THE TORTURED AND NO GOD THAT SAVES A MARTYR FROM THE FLAMES
DURING THESE CENTURIES THE PEOPLE LIVED WITH THEIR BACK TO THE SUNRISE AND PURSUED THEIR WAY TOWARD THE DENS OF IGNORANCE AND FAITH
EVERY CHURCH CRIES
THEREFORE REJOICE YE HEAVENS AND YE THAT DWELL IN THEM
WE KNOW THAT JUST SO MANY ATOMS OF ONE SUBSTANCE WILL UNITE WITH JUST SO MANY OF ANOTHER
THE GREAT VOLUME OF NATURE SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL
IT MAY BE THAT ALL THE MIRACLES DESCRIBED IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT WERE PERFORMED
DAY BY DAY HER POWER WANED BUT HER FAITH INCREASED
WE ARE SATISFIED THAT ALL THE GODS ARE PHANTOMS AND THAT THE SUPERNATURAL DOES NOT EXIST
IF THE DEVIL DOES NOT EXIST--IF LITTLE DEVILS DO NOT ENTER THE BODIES OF MEN--THE NEW TESTAMENT MAY BE INSPIRED BUT IT IS NOT TRUE
I HAVE HEARD ALL MY LIFE ABOUT SELF-DENIAL
THAT THE INDESTRUCTIBLE IS THE UNCREATABLE
WHEN YOU FINALLY UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHY THAT EVERYTHING EXISTS AS THE RESULT OF AN EFFICIENT CAUSE AND THAT THE LIGHTEST FANCY THAT EVER FLUTTERED ITS PAINTED WINGS IN THE HORIZON OF HOPE WAS AS NECESSARILY PRODUCED AS THE PLANET THAT IN ITS ORBIT WHEELS ABOUT THE SUN--WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THIS I BELIEVE YOU WILL HAVE CHARITY FOR ALL MANKIND--INCLUDING EVEN YOURSELF
WHAT RAYS OF GLORY WOULD STREAM FROM HIS SIGHTLESS SOCKETS AND HOW THE HEART WOULD LONG FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS STILLING HAND
IF CONGRESS BY LAW WOULD MAKE FIFTY CENTS WORTH OF SILVER WORTH A DOLLAR THAT WOULD BE A FINANCIAL MIRACLE
THEN CAME EVOLUTION THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND NATURAL SELECTION
THEY EXAMINED THE CHALK CLIFFS FOUND THAT THEY WERE COMPOSED OF THE MICROSCOPIC SHELLS OF MINUTE ORGANISMS THAT IS TO SAY THE DUST OF THESE SHELLS
THE TRUTH
THE TRUTH
IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO THE HUMAN RACE THAT WOMEN THAT MOTHERS SHOULD BE FREE
CAN THE WORLD BE CIVILIZED TO THAT DEGREE THAT CONSEQUENCES WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY ALL
LIFE WAS NOT IMPORTED
IT IS A RELIC OF BARBARISM AND SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED ONE MOMENT
I REMEMBER THAT HE EXPLAINED THE MIRACLE OF FEEDING THE WANDERING JEWS WITH QUAILS BY SAYING THAT EVEN AT THIS DAY IMMENSE NUMBERS OF QUAILS CROSSED THE RED SEA AND THAT SOMETIMES WHEN TIRED THEY SETTLED ON SHIPS THAT SANK BENEATH THEIR WEIGHT
ON EVERY BLADE OF GRASS SOMETHING THAT KILLS,--SOMETHING THAT SUFFERS
JULIUS CAESAR SOLD TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER AT ONETIME FIFTY-THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS OF WAR ALL OF WHOM WERE WHITE
AND HE TELLS US ALSO AS A FACT THAT THE FIRST INVALID THAT GOT IN THE WATER AFTER IT HAD BEEN TROUBLED WAS CURED OF WHAT DISEASE HE HAD
THEY TAUGHT US HOW TO BUILD HOMES TO OBTAIN FOOD TO WEAVE CLOTH
THEY WERE NOT SAINTS
WE NOW KNOW THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE TORTURED AND BURNED FOR HAVING BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF AN IMPOSSIBLE CRIME AND WE ALSO KNOW IF OUR MINDS HAVE NOT BEEN DEFORMED BY FAITH THAT ALL THE BOOKS IN WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF WITCHES IS TAUGHT WERE WRITTEN BY IGNORANT AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEN
HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR CANCERS FOR MICROBES FOR DIPHTHERIA AND THE THOUSAND DISEASES THAT PREY ON INFANCY
BUT ALL OF OUR THEOLOGY WAS NOT IN PROSE
BACK OF ALL EVENTS THEY PUT SPIRITS GOOD OR BAD ANGELS OR DEMONS GODS OR DEVILS
THE BELIEVERS IN THE SUPERNATURAL IN A POWER SUPERIOR TO NATURE IN GOD HAVE WHAT THEY CALL INSPIRED BOOKS THESE BOOKS CONTAIN THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO AMERICA THAN THAT THE BABES OF AMERICA SHOULD BE BORN AROUND THE FIRESIDES OF HOMES
HE MUST BREAK THE CHAINS OF PREJUDICE AND CUSTOM
IT IS THIS DEVIL THAT KILLS THE CHILDREN OF JOB
CREDULITY GAVE TONGUES AND WINGS TO LIES WHILE THE DUMB AND LIMPING FACTS WERE LEFT BEHIND--WERE DISREGARDED AND REMAINED UNTOLD
SO THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF LUCKY AND UNLUCKY TILINGS WARNINGS OMENS AND PROPHECIES BUT ALL SENSIBLE SANE AND REASONING HUMAN BEINGS KNOW THAT EVERY ONE IS AN ABSURD AND IDIOTIC SUPERSTITION
SUPERSTITION IS THE ONLY ENEMY OF SCIENCE IN ALL THE WORLD
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT NO HOPE OF PREFERMENT NO HONOR NO WEALTH SHALL EVER MAKE ME FOR ONE MOMENT SWERVE FROM WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE NO MATTER WHETHER IT IS TO MY IMMEDIATE INTEREST AS ONE WOULD THINK OR NOT
BRUTE FORCE IS NO REMEDY
THEY CONSTRUCTED ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS
THEY COVERED THE SEAS WITH IRON SHIPS AND THE LAND WITH ROADS AND STEEDS OF STEEL
THEY BECAME SUBSTANTIALLY INSANE
THE CAUSE OF PHENOMENA FILLED OUR ANCESTORS NOT ONLY WITH WONDER BUT WITH TERROR
KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS CHRIST SAID
THEY WOULD NOT THEY COULD NOT KEEP HIS LAWS
WILL THE EMPLOYER EVER BECOME CIVILIZED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND SHOULD NOT ABSOLUTELY APPLY IN THE LABOR MARKET OF THE WORLD
POPES CARDINALS BISHOPS PRIESTS MONKS AND HERETICS WERE ALL INSANE
LET HIM DISTRIBUTE KIND WORDS WORDS OF WISDOM OF CHEERFULNESS AND HOPE
THE STEAMSHIPS THE GREAT FACTORIES THE RAILROADS HAVE ALL BEEN BUILT WITH BORROWED MONEY MONEY ON WHICH INTEREST WAS PROMISED AND FOR THE MOST PART PAID
POOR NAKED WRETCHES WHERESOE'ER YOU ARE THAT BIDE THE PELTING OF THIS PITILESS STORM HOW SHALL YOUR UNHOUSED HEADS YOUR UNFED SIDES YOUR LOOPED AND WINDOWED RAGGEDNESS DEFEND YOU FROM SEASONS SUCH AS THESE
THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD WAS LAVISHED ON HIS SHRINES
I READ HIS SKYLARK--A WINGED FLAME--PASSIONATE AS BLOOD--TENDER AS TEARS--PURE AS LIGHT
NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL THESE SIGNS AND WONDERS IN THE HEAVENS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FATE OF KINGS NATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS
THEY DECEIVED SOMETIMES THE WISEST AND THE BEST
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE PENALTY GREAT ENOUGH HORRIBLE ENOUGH TO LESSEN CRIME
THESE SCOTCH SLAVES WERE COLLIERS AND SALTERS
SO THERE MAY BE A DEVIL ALMOST INFINITE IN CUNNING AND POWER AND HE MAY HAVE A COUNTLESS NUMBER OF IMPS WHOSE ONLY BUSINESS IS TO SOW THE SEEDS OF EVIL AND TO VEX MISLEAD CAPTURE AND IMPRISON IN ETERNAL FLAMES THE SOULS OF MEN
A FEW OF THESE WRETCHES HE SELECTED AND MADE THEM OBJECTS OF HIS LOVE AND CARE THE REST OF THE WORLD HE GAVE TO INDIFFERENCE AND NEGLECT
I FOUND THAT ALL RELIGIONS RESTED ON A MISTAKEN CONCEPTION OF NATURE--THAT THE RELIGION OF A PEOPLE WAS THE SCIENCE OF THAT PEOPLE THAT IS TO SAY THEIR EXPLANATION OF THE WORLD--OF LIFE AND DEATH--OF ORIGIN AND DESTINY
IF THE DEVILS WERE ONLY PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL WHAT WERE THE ANGELS
IN LONDON THE HOUSES WERE OF WOOD OR PLASTER THE STREETS FILTHY BEYOND EXPRESSION EVEN MUDDIER THAN BLOOMINGTON IS NOW
AND DEVILS ALSO CAME OUT OF MANY CRYING OUT AND SAYING THOU ART CHRIST THE SON OF GOD IT IS ALSO SAID THAT CHRIST REBUKED THEM AND SUFFERED THEM NOT TO SPEAK FOR THEY KNEW THAT HE WAS CHRIST
MY GOD
MY GOD
AND WHY SHOULD WE BE MENTALLY HONEST AND HOSPITABLE
LET HIM GIVE BACK THE THING STOLEN AND IN FUTURE LIVE AN HONEST LIFE
THE SCOTCH ARE CALVINISTS BECAUSE THEIR FATHERS WERE
COSMAS SAID THE EARTH WAS FLAT
I SEE THEM BUILDING ALTARS TO THE UNSEEN POWERS STAINING THEM WITH BLOOD OF CHILD AND BEAST
THE SCIENTIST INSIST THAT THE UNKNOWN IS NOT CHANGED SO FAR AS HE KNOWS BY PRAYERS OF PEOPLE OR PRIESTS
ALL OUR DUTIES ARE WITHIN OUR REACH--ALL OUR OBLIGATIONS MUST BE DISCHARGED HERE IN THIS WORLD
THE UNIVERSE WAS GETTING IMMENSE
THE TELESCOPE HAS DONE AWAY WITH THE ANCIENT HEAVEN AND THE REVOLVING WORLD HAS QUENCHED THE FLAMES OF THE ANCIENT HELL
THE USUAL CHARGE FOR FREIGHT WAS 30 CENTS PER TON A MILE
THE LONELY THE FORSAKEN HOPE FOR LOVE.--HOPE BRINGS THE LOVER TO THEIR ARMS
WHEN SLAVES BEGIN TO REASON SLAVERY BEGINS TO DIE
OH I HAVE TA'EN TOO LITTLE CARE OF THIS
HE WOULD HAVE THE FEELING THAT HE HAD BEEN MADE A BETTER MAN
THE TREE OF LIFE GREW IN INDIA IN CHINA AND AMONG THE AZTECS LONG BEFORE THE GARDEN OF EDEN WAS PLANTED
WAS THE ANGEL WHO TOLD JOSEPH THAT HEROD WAS DEAD A PERSONIFICATION OF NEWS
THEY HAVE LOST THE VERACITY OF THE SOUL
WHOSE CAPRICE GOVERNS THE WORLD AND WHO CAN BE PERSUADED BY PRAYER SOFTENED BY CEREMONY AND WHO WILL AS A REWARD FOR FAITH SAVE MEN FROM THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS
THEN I ASKED MYSELF THE QUESTION
THE MAN OF STRAW WILL THEN BE DEAD
ASMODEUS PRINCE OF REVENGEFUL DEVILS
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE TRULY INTELLIGENT MAN CANNOT BE HAPPY CANNOT BE SATISFIED WHEN MILLIONS OF HIS FELLOW-MEN ARE HUNGRY AND NAKED
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CRUCIFIXION SHE LINGERED NEAR
INGERSOLL'S LAST PUBLIC ADDRESS DELIVERED BEFORE THE AMERICAN FREE RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATION IN THE HOLLIS STREET THEATRE BOSTON JUNE 2 1899
HE HAS RENOUNCED HIS REASON--EXTINGUISHED THE TORCH OF HIS BRAIN HE HAS BELIEVED WITHOUT EVIDENCE AND AGAINST EVIDENCE
IF THINE RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT
FREE THE MIND ALLOW MEN TO WRITE AND PUBLISH AND READ AND ONE BY ONE THE SHACKLES WILL DROP BROKEN IN THE DUST
EACH ONE IS A PERHAPS
LET ME SAY A WORD OR TWO UPON THAT
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MEN TO BECOME EDUCATED AND REFINED WITHOUT LEISURE AND THERE CAN BE NO LEISURE WITHOUT WEALTH AND ALL WEALTH IS PRODUCED BY LABOR NOTHING ELSE
THE MAN OF STRAW PITCHED PROF SWING OUT OF THE PULPIT AND DROVE THE REV
THE HUMAN MIND WAS IN CHAINS
SCIENCE IS A BENEFACTOR
WHOSOEVER THEN FIRST AFTER THE TROUBLING OF THE WATER STEPPED IN WAS MADE WHOLE OF WHATSOEVER DISEASE HE HAD
THAT YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT THE HOLY GHOST PROCEEDED
GEOGRAPHY
HISTORY BEGAN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF LEGEND AND RUMOR
IN 1610 ON THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 7TH GALILEO DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM AND IN 1632 PUBLISHED HIS WORK ON THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD WHAT DID THE CHURCH DO
WHAT HE IS HE WAS AND WILL BE UNCHANGED UNCHANGEABLE
ALL THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH BELIEVED IN DEVILS
MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE POOR
HE IS TOLD ABOUT ORIGINAL SIN AND THE ATONEMENT AND HE BELIEVES WHAT HE HEARS
THEIR FORTUNE IS THEIR MASTER FOR WHOM THEY WORK AND TOIL LIKE SLAVES
THE PRISONER HAVING BEEN TAUGHT WE WILL SAY FOR FIVE YEARS--TAUGHT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT OF THE NATURALNESS AND HARMONY OF VIRTUE OF THE DISCORD OF CRIME
THEY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD
FOR FROM HENCEFORTH THERE SHALL BE FIVE IN ONE HOUSE DIVIDED THREE AGAINST TWO AND TWO AGAINST THREE
HE WAS PERFECTLY CALM
WE CAN FILL OUR LIVES WITH GENEROUS DEEDS WITH LOVING WORDS WITH ART AND SONG AND ALL THE ECSTASIES OF LOVE
THAT THEY STILL LIVE AND LOVE AND WAIT FOR YOU
ACCORDING TO JOHN HE REMAINED MOSTLY IN JERUSALEM GOING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE COUNTRY AND THEN GENERALLY TO AVOID HIS ENEMIES
THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MECHANICAL POWERS AND THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION
THAT UPON YOU MAY COME ALL THE RIGHTEOUS BLOOD SHED UPON THE EARTH FROM THE BLOOD OF RIGHTEOUS ABEL UNTO THE BLOOD OF ZACHARIAS SON OF BARACHIAS WHOM YE SLEW BETWEEN THE TEMPLE AND THE ALTAR IT IS CERTAIN THAT THESE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN BY CHRIST
WHAT IS FORCE
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL SEE THAT THAT IS JUST AS LOGICAL
BESIDES IT IS HARD TO SEE WHY CHRISTIANS HATE LOATHE AND DESPISE JUDAS
IT IS THE ONE INFINITE HORROR
AT THAT TIME THE JEWISH BIBLE DID NOT CONTAIN DANIEL ECCLESIASTES BUT FEW OF THE PSALMS AND ONLY A PART OF ISAIAH
IN THE HUMAN RACE THERE IS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FAILURES
THAT IT IS SUFFICIENT TO BELIEVE IN GOD
MANY PERSONS THOUGHT THE RISK SO GREAT THAT IT WAS TEMPTING PROVIDENCE TO GET INTO ONE OF THEM
NATIONS RACES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY THIS MONSTER
TRUTH GIVES MAN THE GREATEST POWER FOR GOOD
THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY ALL THE SCIENCES--EXCEPT THEOLOGY--ARE EAGER FOR FACTS--HUNGRY FOR THE TRUTH
1900 THE DRESDEN EDITION CONTENTS OF VOLUME IV
WE NOW BELIEVE THAT EVENTS HAVE NATURAL PARENTS AND THAT NONE DIE CHILDLESS
ONE MOTH WITH PAINTED WINGS AS ALL THE THINGS THAT LIVE
THEY PERSEVERED FOR TWENTY YEARS AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE 25TH OF MARCH 1808 THAT ENGLAND PRONOUNCED THE INFAMOUS TRAFFIC IN HUMAN FLESH ILLEGAL AND THE REJOICING IN ENGLAND WAS REDOUBLED ON RECEIVING THE NEWS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD DONE THE SAME THING
THEY BELIEVE THE SAME
BEAUTY WAS PAGAN
WE BELIEVE THAT CUNNING PLATES FRAUD WITH THE GOLD OF HONESTY AND VENEERS VICE WITH VIRTUE
THEY TAUGHT HYDROSTATICS AND DETERMINED THE SPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF BODIES
THEY HATE THE MAN WHO THINKS
FAITH WITHOUT FACTS IS NOT RELIGION
NEPTUNE WAS FRIGHTENED FROM THE SEA
YET YOUNG HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO BE A BISHOP AND TO ACCOMPLISH THAT END HE ELECTIONEERED WITH THE KING'S MISTRESS
THEY WILL BE DUST
IN THIS BUILDING SHOULD BE THE LIBRARY OF THE TOWN
I AM NOT ON THAT QUESTION
THEY DWELT ON THE PANGS THE REGRETS THE INFINITE AGONIES OF THE LOST AND SHOWED HOW EASILY THEY COULD BE AVOIDED AND HOW CHEAPLY HEAVEN COULD BE OBTAINED
THE FAMILY THE TRIBE THE NATION CREATES A STANDARD OF CONDUCT OF MORALITY
THE LITTLE CHURCHES IN WHICH THE SERVICES WERE HELD WERE GENERALLY SMALL BADLY VENTILATED AND EXCEEDINGLY WARM
YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT
NO ATONEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AND THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD HAVE GONE TO HELL
WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH THE SLANDER
HOW THEN CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE CYCLONE THE FLOOD THE DROUGHT THE GLITTERING BOLT THAT KILLS
THE CHURCH FOUNDED COLLEGES NOT TO EDUCATE MEN BUT TO MAKE PROSELYTES CONVERTS DEFENDERS
WE KNOW THAT LIGHT IS NOT DARKNESS AND THAT DARKNESS IS NOT LIGHT
THAT THE POWERS THAT BE ARE ORDAINED OF GOD AND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO OVERTURN AND DESTROY THE POWERS THAT BE
ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION OF QUEEN ELIZABETH SHE WAS PRESENTED WITH A GENEVA BIBLE BY AN OLD MAN REPRESENTING TIME WITH TRUTH STANDING BY HIS SIDE AS A CHILD
THEY HAVE CONSOLED THE HERO'S WIDOW AND ARE EDUCATING HIS ORPHANS
SUPERSTITION GAVE US ALL THE PRAYERS AND CEREMONIES
IF THEY OBTAIN A PLACE THEY ARE DISCHARGED AS SOON AS IT IS FOUND THAT THEY WERE IN PRISON
IT IS HIS DUTY TO CAST OUT FROM THE TEMPLE OF HIS SOUL THE GODDESS REASON AND BOW BEFORE THE COILED SERPENT OF FEAR
NO STOVES NO COOKING RANGE NO BAKING POWDER NO POTATOES--THINK OF IT
IT IS SO THAT ALL MEN ARE NOT CAPABLE OF GETTING A LIVING
WHY THEN SHOULD WE SAY THAT GOD IS GOOD
THE BACKS THAT BORE THE BURDENS ALSO BORE THE MARKS OF THE LASH
WILL KNEELINGS GIVE US WEALTH
THEY ARE SENT TO THE PENITENTIARY FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS TREATED LIKE WILD BEASTS FREQUENTLY TORTURED
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEFT THEIR HOMES IN LOW LANDS BY THE RIVERS AND NEAR THE SEA AND SOUGHT THE MORE ELEVATED GROUND
HE HAS CAUSED HIS VOLCANOES TO DEVOUR THE GOOD AND THE BAD HIS CYCLONES TO WRECK AND REND THE GENEROUS AND THE CRUEL HIS FLOODS TO DROWN THE LOVING AND THE HATEFUL HIS LIGHTNING TO KILL THE VIRTUOUS AND THE VICIOUS HIS FAMINES TO STARVE THE INNOCENT AND CRIMINAL AND HIS PLAGUES TO DESTROY THE WISE AND GOOD THE IGNORANT AND WICKED
THAT NO GOD EXISTS WHO ANSWERS PRAYER
THE STARS INDICATE THE WORDS MISSING IN THE MANUSCRIPT
THE MEN WHO HAVE LENGTHENED LIFE AND CONQUERED PAIN
THE SCHEME OF REDEMPTION--VII
EACH MUST READ FOR HIMSELF--AND EACH OUGHT HONESTLY AND FEARLESSLY TO GIVE TO HIS FELLOW-MEN WHAT HE LEARNS
BUT THE SAME GOD MADE THE RHINOCEROS AND SUPPLIED HIM WITH A HORN ON HIS NOSE WITH WHICH HE DISEMBOWELS THE HIPPOPOTAMUS
THESE LIES MUST BE SOWN AND PLANTED IN HIS BRAIN THE FIRST OF ALL
IN THE LITERATURE OF THE WORLD THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THE SACRED BOOKS MORE PERFECTLY ABSURD
VOLTAIRE--A NAME THAT SHEDS LIGHT
FROM THE RUINS OF BABYLON OF CARTHAGE OF ATHENS OF PALMYRA OF THEBES OF ROME AND ACROSS THE GREAT DESERT OVER THAT SAD AND SOLEMN SEA OF SAND FROM THE LAND OF THE PYRAMIDS OVER THE FALLEN SPHINX AND FROM THE LIPS OF MEMNON THE SAME VOICE THE SAME WARNING AND UTTERING THE GREAT TRUTH THAT NO NATION FOUNDED UPON SLAVERY EITHER OF BODY OR MIND CAN STAND
I THANK JEFFERSON WHOSE MIGHTY WORDS FOR LIBERTY HAVE MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE GLOBE
SO I AM IN FAVOR OF A LAW FINALLY TO BE CARRIED OUT--NOT BY ROBBERY BUT BY COMPENSATION UNDER THE RIGHT AS THE LAWYERS CALL IT OF EMINENT DOMAIN--SO THAT NO PERSON WOULD BE ALLOWED TO OWN MORE LAND THAN HE USES
I READ SHELLEY'S QUEEN MAB--A POEM FILLED WITH BEAUTY COURAGE THOUGHT SYMPATHY TEARS AND SCORN IN WHICH A BRAVE SOUL TEARS DOWN THE PRISON WALLS AND FLOODS THE CELLS WITH LIGHT
DID THE WILD BEASTS LIVE AND DID THE ANGELS MINISTER UNTO CHRIST
WHAT IS SUPERSTITION
TO WEAR AN OPAL IS BAD LUCK BUT RUBIES BRING HEALTH
THERE ARE ALREADY RAILROADS ENOUGH IN THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE A DOUBLE TRACK AROUND THE WORLD
THEY FORGOT HEAVEN AND HELL LONG ENOUGH TO TAKE SOME INTEREST IN THIS WORLD
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE DID EACH DAY AND WHEN HE RESTED
NO GOD WHO SUCCORS THE OPPRESSED
NOW SOCIETY BOWS AND KNEELS AT THE FEET OF WEALTH
THE FALL OF MAN IS CONTRADICTED BY EVERY FACT CONCERNING HUMAN HISTORY THAT WE KNOW
THE PROTESTANTS SAY THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY PERSON TO READ TO UNDERSTAND AND TO BELIEVE THIS REVELATION--THAT A MAN SHOULD USE HIS REASON
ALL LIFE JOURNEYING TOWARD DEATH AND ALL DEATH HASTENING BACK TO LIFE
THIS IS WHY I HATE ITS UNTHINKABLE GOD ITS IMPOSSIBLE CHRIST ITS INSPIRED LIES AND ITS SELFISH HEARTLESS HEAVEN
TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OBLIGATION PERCEIVED IS TO BE FREE AND NOBLE
WE ARE STANDING ON THE SHORE OF AN INFINITE OCEAN WHOSE COUNTLESS WAVES FREIGHTED WITH BLESSINGS ARE WELCOMING OUR ADVENTUROUS FEET
THAT SLAVERY EITHER OF BODY OR MIND IS BARBARISM AND IS PRACTICED AND DEFENDED ONLY BY INFAMOUS TYRANTS OR THEIR DUPES
HIS NAME CARRIED CONSOLATION TO THE DISEASED AND DYING
SO IN MOHAMMEDAN COUNTRIES THEY CAN KNEEL IN THE SAME MOSQUE AND PRAY TO THE SAME GOD
FROM THIS SURPLUS THE PAINTER IS PAID FOR THE IMMORTAL PRODUCTIONS OF THE PENCIL
TO BELIEVE IN MIRACLES SPELLS AND CHARMS IN DREAMS AND PROPHECIES
THE ENERGIES OF MAN ARE WASTED IN A VAIN EFFORT TO SECURE THE PROTECTION OF THE SUPERNATURAL
LIFE AT THE FOUNTAIN SHOULD NOT BE POLLUTED
IN A WEAK AND BROKEN VOICE HE SAID
COULD HE HAVE AVOIDED BEING GOOD
NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THE INSPIRED BOOK--EXCEPT LEGENDS AND PRAYERS--COULD BE OF ANY VALUE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE ACCOUNT IN THE BIBLE OF THE CREATION OF THE FIRST MAN IS A MISTAKE
I SEE OTHERS SPURNING IDOLS AND POURING OUT THEIR HOPES AND FEARS TO A VAGUE IMAGE IN THE MIND
SCIENCE MUST MAKE WOMAN THE OWNER THE MISTRESS OF HERSELF
THE OTHER REFUSES
HE DOES NOT SAY THAT THE UNKNOWN IS GOD THAT IT CREATED SUBSTANCE AND FORCE LIFE AND THOUGHT
I SEE THEM ALL
THAT ALL SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN IN VAIN AND THAT ALL PRAYERS HAVE DIED UNANSWERED IN THE HEEDLESS AIR
EVERYTHING THEY DID WAS A PIOUS FRAUD
HE WILL LESSEN PAIN
TRUTH IS THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF THE WORLD
THEY ARE SOCIAL
IT NEVER DID AND NEVER CAN PURCHASE RESPECT
IT REQUIRED A LITTLE IMAGINATION AND A FEW CIPHERS TO CHANGE SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO SEVEN THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS
IN OTHER WORDS IS THE STORY TRUE OR IS IT POETRY OR METAPHOR OR MISTAKE OR FALSEHOOD
ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS PILATE WANTED TO SAVE HIM
WE KNOW THAT GOOD IS NOT EVIL AND THAT EVIL IS NOT GOOD
THE OLD TESTAMENT--STORY OF THE CREATION--AGE OF THE EARTH AND OF MAN--ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS OF THE EGYPTIANS--THE FLOOD--THE FIRMAMENT A FICTION--ISRAELITES WHO WENT INTO EGYPT--BATTLES OF THE JEWS--AREA OF PALESTINE--GOLD COLLECTED BY DAVID FOR THE TEMPLE--II
NOW WHY SHOULD THIS DEVIL IN ANOTHER WORLD TORMENT SINNERS WHO ARE HIS FRIENDS TO PLEASE GOD HIS ENEMY
THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD--HAVE READ THE SACRED BOOKS THE PROPHECIES THE COMMANDMENTS THE RULES OF CONDUCT
THE THEOLOGIANS THEN TOOK THE GROUND THAT THE DAYS SPOKEN OF IN GENESIS WERE PERIODS OF TIME EPOCHS SIX LONG WHILES AND THAT THE WORK OF CREATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMENCED MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO
IF THIS IS TRUE I ASK WHY THE INFANT DIES
I THANK THE UNKNOWN MAN WHO MOULDED AND CHISELED THE VENUS DE MILO
MAN SHOULD THINK
HE SAYS THAT THERE WENT OUT A DECREE FROM CAESAR AUGUSTUS THAT ALL THE WORLD SHOULD BE TAXED
AS A MATTER OF FACT ZACHARIAS WAS KILLED BY THE JEWS DURING THE SEIGE OF JERUSALEM BY TITUS AND THIS SEIGE TOOK PLACE SEVENTY-ONE YEARS AFTER THE BIRTH OF CHRIST THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS AFTER HE WAS DEAD
THIS IS THE COURSE PURSUED BY WISE AND HONEST MEN AND NO OTHER COURSE IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM
WE MUST TAKE IT ALL JUST AS IT IS
I SEE THE COUNTLESS PRIESTS AND HEAR THEIR SOLEMN CHANTS
THEY THINK THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH SERMONS AND POEMS ABOUT DEATH AND HELL
POOR SOLOMON WITH HIS THOUSAND WIVES AND NO CARPETS HIS GREAT TEMPLE AND NO GAS LIGHT
ACCORDING TO ONE ACCOUNT CHRIST ASCENDED THE DAY OF OR THE DAY AFTER HIS RESURRECTION
YOU MAY REPENT AND REFORM YOU MAY MAKE RESTITUTION YOU MAY PRACTICE ALL THE VIRTUES BUT WITHOUT THIS BELIEF IN CHRIST THE GATES OF HEAVEN WILL BE SHUT AGAINST YOU FOREVER
WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF INSPIRED BOOKS--THE ORIGIN OF RELIGIONS
WHAT I SAY IS THAT EVERY HONEST TEACHER OF THE SUPERNATURAL HAS BEEN AND IS AN UNCONSCIOUS ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE
THEN CAME THE QUESTION
DID THEY SAY ANYTHING IN FAVOR OF INVESTIGATION--OF STUDY--OF THOUGHT
AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS MUCH CRIME MUCH POVERTY MUCH WANT AND CONSEQUENTLY SOMETHING MUST BE DONE NOW
DOES THE CHRISTIAN GO THERE AT DEATH OR MUST HE WAIT FOR THE GENERAL RESURRECTION
WE ARE THE HEIRS OF HABITS AND MENTAL CUSTOMS
IT IS A LONG ROAD FROM THE SAVAGE TO THE SCIENTIST--FROM A DEN TO A MANSION--FROM LEAVES TO CLOTHES--FROM A FLICKERING RUSH TO THE ARC-LIGHT--FROM A HAMMER OF STONE TO THE MODERN MILL--A LONG DISTANCE FROM THE PIPE OF PAN TO THE VIOLIN--TO THE ORCHESTRA--FROM A FLOATING LOG TO THE STEAMSHIP--FROM A SICKLE TO A REAPER--FROM A FLAIL TO A THRESHING MACHINE---FROM A CROOKED STICK TO A PLOW--FROM A SPINNING WHEEL TO A SPINNING JENNY--FROM A HAND LOOM TO A JACQUARD--A JACQUARD THAT WEAVES FAIR FORMS AND WONDROUS FLOWERS BEYOND ARACHNE'S UTMOST DREAM--FROM A FEW HIEROGLYPHICS ON THE SKINS OF BEASTS--ON BRICKS OF CLAY--TO A PRINTING PRESS TO A LIBRARY--A LONG DISTANCE FROM THE MESSENGER TRAVELING ON FOOT TO THE ELECTRIC SPARK--FROM KNIVES AND TOOLS OF STONE TO THOSE OF STEEL--A LONG DISTANCE FROM SAND TO TELESCOPES--FROM ECHO TO THE PHONOGRAPH THE PHONOGRAPH THAT BURIES IN INDENTED LINES AND DOTS THE SOUNDS OF LIVING SPEECH AND THEN GIVES BACK TO LIFE THE VERY WORDS AND VOICES OF THE
ALL THESE BELIEFS NOW REJECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE--THE DEVIL'S SUCCESS MADE THE COMING OF CHRIST A NECESSITY--"THOU SHALT NOT SUFFER A WITCH TO LIVE"--SOME BIBLICAL ANGELS--VANISHED VISIONS--V
THE HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WERE HUTS THATCHED WITH STRAW
A GOD COULD NOT ACCEPT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE GUILTY.--THIS IS A COMPLETE SUBVERSION OF ALL IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND MORALITY
JERUSALEM WAS TAKEN BY TITUS ABOUT 70 YEARS AFTER CHRIST
ONE GRAIN OF SAND AS ALL THE WORLD
HE DOES NOT CARE WHETHER THE FIRST COMER TO A THEATRE IS CROSSEYED OR HUMP-BACKED BOW-LEGGED OR AS WELL-PROPORTIONED AS APOLLO
CREDULITY OCCUPIED THE THRONE OF REASON AND FAITH PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE SOUL
HE SAW THE SEEDS THAT MAN HAD PLANTED WITHER AND PERISH BUT HE SENT NO RAIN
THEY WROTE AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THE TRACKS OF PHARAOH'S CHARIOT WHEELS WERE STILL IMPRESSED UPON THE SANDS OF THE RED SEA AND COULD NOT BE OBLITERATED EITHER BY THE WINDS OR WAVES
THERE WAS A SHOEMAKER--TWO OF THEM--A TAILOR OR TWO A BLACKSMITH A WHEELWRIGHT
WE HAD PILGRIM'S PROGRESS BAXTER'S CALL AND BUTLER'S ANALOGY
THE DYING HOPES THAT DEATH IS BUT ANOTHER BIRTH AND LOVE LEANS ABOVE THE PALLID FACE AND WHISPERS WE SHALL MEET AGAIN HOPE IS THE CONSOLATION OF THE WORLD
HIS VOTE WILL COUNT JUST AS MANY AS THOUGH THE HAND THAT CAST IT CONTROLLED MILLIONS
WHOEVER SAW AN ANGEL BAREFOOTED THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS HAS NEVER BEEN ESTABLISHED
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE WORKS OF ROBERT G
I ADMIT THAT ALL RELIGIONS ALL CREEDS ALL PRIESTS HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
THAT HE HAD BEEN TREATED WITH JUSTICE WITH MERCY AND THE MONEY HE CARRIED WITH HIM WOULD BE A BREASTWORK BEHIND WHICH HE COULD DEFY TEMPTATION A BREASTWORK THAT WOULD SUPPORT AND TAKE CARE OF HIM UNTIL HE COULD FIND SOME MEANS BY WHICH TO SUPPORT HIMSELF
SOME OF THE CROAKERS OF THE PRESENT DAY AGAINST PROGRESS WOULD I THINK BE THE BETTER OF SUCH A VOMIT
FOR CENTURIES CHRISTENDOM WAS A MADHOUSE
DID THE AUTHOR OF THIS ACCOUNT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL OR DID HE REGARD THIS DEVIL AS A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL AND DID HE INTEND THAT HIS ACCOUNT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ALLEGORY OR AS A POEM OR AS A MYTH
YET CHRISTIANS FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST MURDERED THIS INCOMPARABLE MAN
ARE NOT THE FACTS IN THE MENTAL WORLD JUST AS STUBBORN--JUST AS NECESSARILY PRODUCED--AS THE FACTS IN THE MATERIAL WORLD
CAN A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL CRAWL ON ITS BELLY
WE CANNOT SAY
HE LOVED THE BEAUTIFUL
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF ABOVE ALL THINGS NOT TO BE A BURDEN UPON OTHERS
THE ORTHODOX OSTRICH THRUSTS HIS HEAD INTO THE SAND
BUT THE NEXT WINTER THEY WERE ON HAND READY TO BE BORN AGAIN THEY FORMED A KIND OF STOCK COMPANY PLAYING THE SAME PARTS EVERY WINTER AND BACKSLIDING EVERY SPRING
PLAYS SHOULD BE PRESENTED BY HOME TALENT
SET AND HIS LEGIONS FOUGHT AGAINST OSIRIS AND AGAINST THE HUMAN RACE
BUT IT IS NOT ALL
WHEN THE MACHINES STOP THREE THOUSAND MEN ARE OUT OF EMPLOYMENT
THAT HE SHOULD FALL
BENEATH THE STRUCTURE CALLED CHRISTIANITY ARE FOUR CORNER-STONES--THE FATHER SON HOLY GHOST AND DEVIL
IT SEEKS TO CALM THE PASSIONS TO DESTROY PREJUDICE AND TO INCREASE THE VOLUME AND INTENSITY OF REASON'S FLAME
TAUGHT MEN TO HATE THEMSELVES TO DESPISE PLEASURE TO SCAR THEIR FLESH TO GROVEL IN THE DUST TO DESERT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN TO SHUN THEIR FELLOW-MEN AND TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN USELESS PAIN AND PRAYER
THEY FILL THEIR POCKETS WITH FOOL'S GOLD AND THINK THEY ARE RICH
WHAT WAS THE RESULT
AT THE RISK OF BEING TIRESOME I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE MIND WHEN ENSLAVED--THE CONSEQUENCES OF ABANDONING JUDGMENT AND REASON--THE EFFECTS OF WIDE SPREAD IGNORANCE AND UNIVERSAL BIGOTRY
THEY GATHERED NO FLOWERS BY THE WAY--THEY WALKED IN THE DUST OF THE ROAD--AVOIDED THE GREEN FIELDS
ANATHEMAS WERE HURLED FROM THE VATICAN AGAINST ALL WHO DARED TO PUBLISH A WORD IN FAVOR OF LIBERTY OR THE SACRED RIGHTS OF MAN
ALL TRIBES AND NATIONS HAVING SUFFERED HAVING BEEN THE SPORT AND PREY OF NATURAL PHENOMENA HAVING BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING POISONED BY WEEDS OVERWHELMED BY VOLCANOES DESTROYED BY EARTHQUAKES BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF A DEVIL WHO WAS THE KING--THE RULER--OF INNUMERABLE SMALLER DEVILS AND ALL THESE DEVILS HAVE BEEN FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL REGARDED AS THE ENEMIES OF MEN
THESE ORTHODOX MINISTERS HAVE BEEN THE SLANDERERS OF THE REALLY GREAT MEN OF OUR CENTURY
NOT ONE WILL CRINGE OR CRAWL FOR GAIN
VOLTAIRE REPLIED SHOW ME THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AND IF IT IS SIGNED BY THE PARTY THAT WAS TO BE A SLAVE I WILL BELIEVE YOU YOU WILL BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SLAVERY OF WHICH I AM NOW SPEAKING IS WHITE SLAVERY
AND THE WOMAN WAS EITHER HANGED OR BURNED FOR A CRIME FOR WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE GUILTY
OLD WOMEN WERE CONVICTED FOR CAUSING STORMS AT SEA--FOR PREVENTING RAIN AND FOR BRINGING FROST
THEY ARE VAMPIRES THAT SUCK THE BLOOD OF HONEST TOIL
CERTAINLY PAUL HAD NOT HEARD THE STORY OF THE BETRAYAL
SIR I HAVE NO MAN WHEN THE WATER IS TROUBLED TO PUT ME INTO THE POOL
THEY DENOUNCE DANCING AS ONE OF THE DEADLY SINS
MATTHEW SAYS THAT JUDAS HANGED HIMSELF
IT HAS DARKENED THE LIVES OF MANY MILLIONS
IT TOUCHED EVERY NERVE OF THE BODY--PRODUCED EVERY PAIN THAT CAN BE FELT EVERY AGONY THAT CAN BE ENDURED
POSSIBLY WITCHES WITH THE DEVIL'S HELP CONTROL THE WINDS BREED STORMS ON SEA AND LAND FILL SUMMER'S LAP WITH FROSTS AND SNOW AND WORK WITH CHARM AND SPELL AGAINST THE PUBLIC WEAL BUT OF THIS WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
MANY CENTURIES AGO THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTENDOM A CODE OF LAWS STUPID UNPHILOSOPHIC AND BRUTAL TO THE LAST DEGREE
IS IT HONEST TO OFFER A REWARD FOR BELIEF
THE INTEREST ON THIS VAST SUM HAS TO BE PAID
IF HE ASKS QUESTIONS HE IS SILENCED BY MORE SOLEMN ASSERTIONS AND WARNED AGAINST THE DEVICES OF THE EVIL ONE
YOU KNOW THE WATCH ARGUMENT WAS PALEY'S GREATEST EFFORT
CAN WE RELY ON THE HISTORICAL PARTS OF THE BIBLE
GRADUALLY MIND CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF MUSCLE AND THOUGHT BECAME THE FRIEND OF LABOR
THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS WHAT WE ASK NOT THE IDEAL
THAT THIS WAS WHEN CYRENIUS WAS GOVERNOR OF SYRIA
EVERY STATE SHOULD FIX THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT COULD BE OWNED BY AN INDIVIDUAL NOT LIABLE TO BE TAKEN FROM HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING A HOME TO ANOTHER AND WHEN ANY MAN OWNED MORE ACRES THAN THE LAW ALLOWED AND ANOTHER SHOULD ASK TO PURCHASE THEM AND HE SHOULD REFUSE I WOULD HAVE THE LAW SO THAT THE PERSON WISHING TO PURCHASE COULD FILE HIS PETITION IN COURT
ONE WHO HAD SOLD HIS SOUL TO SATAN MADE A FEW MOTIONS UTTERED SOME STRANGE WORDS AND THE EVENT WAS PRESENT
IT IS WELL TO KNOW THAT THE SEEDS OF THOUGHT WERE SOWN IN OUR MINDS BY THE GREEKS AND ROMANS AND THAT OUR LITERATURE CAME FROM THOSE SEEDS
EVERYTHING SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND ENEMIES--BY THE LOVE THAT PROTECTS BY THE HATE THAT KILLS
HE SIMPLY SAYS THAT OF THE UNKNOWN HE KNOWS NOTHING
WHILE HE READS HE HAS NO RIGHT TO THINK NO RIGHT TO REASON
I KNOW THAT LIFE IS GOOD
HE KNEW THAT GOD WAS INFINITE AND YET HE WAGED WAR AGAINST HIM AND INDUCED ABOUT A THIRD OF THE ANGELS TO VOLUNTEER
TO PUT THOUGHT INTENTION AND DESIGN BACK OF NATURE
THERE WERE SPLENDID DAMASCUS BLADES WHEN PLOWING WAS DONE WITH A CROOKED STICK
IT DEFIES ALL FORCE
TO INSURE YOUR LIFE WAS TO DECLARE THAT YOU HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN GOD--THAT YOU RELIED ON A CORPORATION INSTEAD OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE
THEY DENY EVERYTHING THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE SACRED SCRIPTURES THEY STILL BELIEVE IN THE ASTRONOMY OF JOSHUA AND THE GEOLOGY OF MOSES
OF COURSE CAPITAL CAN DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF LABOR
THEY ENTERTAINED AND CONSEQUENTLY EXPRESSED NO DOUBT AS TO ANY PARTICULAR AND IN CASE OF ANY DIFFICULTY THEY ALWAYS HAD A FEW MIRACLES READY JUST SUITED FOR THE OCCASION AND THE PEOPLE NEVER FOR AN INSTANT DOUBTED THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF EVERY STATEMENT THAT THEY MADE
A CARDINAL LOOKING AT THE PICTURE SAID TO THE ARTIST
SUPERSTITION IMPRISONED THE VIRTUOUS TORTURED THE THOUGHTFUL KILLED THE HEROIC PUT CHAINS ON THE BODY MANACLES ON THE BRAIN AND UTTERLY DESTROYED THE LIBERTY OF SPEECH
IT IS TOLD THAT THE GREAT ANGELO IN DECORATING A CHURCH PAINTED SOME ANGELS WEARING SANDALS
WHAT HARM DOES SUPERSTITION DO
IT HAS PUT OIL ON THE DYING AND REPEATED PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD
GO TO LONDON THE GREATEST CITY OF THIS WORLD WHERE THERE IS THE MOST WEALTH--THE GREATEST GLITTERING PILES OF GOLD
CAN A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL EAT DUST
BUT BEFORE THEY CAN ACT IN THIS WAY THEY MUST BECOME REALLY INTELLIGENT INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS REASONABLE AND HONEST ENOUGH TO ASK FOR NO MORE
THERE IS NONE
HOW MALICIOUS IS MERCY
THEY SLANDER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES
IN OTHER WORDS IT PROVES THAT MAN HAS NEVER RECEIVED ANY HELP FROM HEAVEN
I THANK HUMBOLDT AND HELMHOLTZ AND HAECKEL AND BUECHNER
HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT THE ANIMALS WHILE IN THE ARK HAD THEIR NATURES CHANGED TO THAT DEGREE THAT THEY DEVOURED STRAW TOGETHER AND ENJOYED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY--THUS PREFIGURING THE BLESSED MILLENNIUM
A MOB OF TWENTY MILLIONS DRIVEN TO DESPERATION IN THE SUBLIMITY OF DESPAIR IN THE SACRED NAME OF LIBERTY CRIED FOR VENGEANCE
THERE IS A MISTAKE
SUPERSTITION IS ALWAYS LIAS BEEN AND FOREVER WILL BE THE ENEMY OF LIBERTY
NATURE DOES NOT FREQUENTLY PRODUCE THE PERFECT
THEY KNEW HOW THEY LOOKED
LIBERTY CANNOT BE SACRIFICED FOR THE SAKE OF TEMPERANCE FOR THE SAKE OF MORALITY OR FOR THE SAKE OF ANYTHING
TAKE THESE LIES FROM THE CREED AND THE WHOLE SCHEME FALLS INTO SHAPELESS RUIN
WE RAISED AND EDUCATED OUR CHILDREN--DENIED OURSELVES
NATURE DOES NOT HURRY
IN A SHORT TIME STEPHENSON INVENTED THE LOCOMOTIVE
BUT IN THE OLD DAYS THE GOOD PEOPLE JUSTIFIED JEHOVAH IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE HEATHEN
FOR THIS WE ARE INDEBTED MORE THAN TO ALL OTHERS TO THE GREATEST OF BIOLOGISTS ERNST HAECKEL
WILL THE TIME ARRIVE AND CAN IT ARRIVE EXCEPT BY DEVELOPING THE BRAIN EXCEPT BY THE AID OF INTELLECTUAL LIGHT WHEN THE PURCHASER WILL WISH TO GIVE WHAT A THING IS WORTH WHEN THE EMPLOYER WILL BE SATISFIED WITH A REASONABLE PROFIT WHEN THE EMPLOYER WILL BE ANXIOUS TO GIVE THE REAL VALUE FOR RAW MATERIAL
THEY HAD NOT ONLY COLLEGES--BUT OBSERVATORIES
THE MAIL BAG WAS CARRIED ON HORSEBACK AT FIVE MILES AN HOUR
IT HAS TRIED TO WEAN THE LAMBS OF THE LORD FROM THE DELIGHTS THE PLEASURES THE JOYS OF LIFE
WHAT HARM IN BELIEVING IN FABLES IN LEGENDS
IT DENOUNCED INSURANCE IN ANY FORM AS GAMBLING AS IMMORAL
I TOOK ANOTHER STEP
YOU HAVE GIVEN UP THE WITCHES AND WIZARDS
THE BOY WAS A LUNATIC SORE VEXED OFTENTIMES FALLING IN THE FIRE AND WATER
IN THAT SCIENCE THERE IS NO MAGIC NO CAPRICE AND NO POSSIBLE USE FOR THE SUPERNATURAL
THEY HAVE CALUMNIATED AND TORTURED
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE NEW TESTAMENT IS INFINITELY WORSE THAN THE OLD
THEY CRAMMED THEIR SHIPS SO FULL OF THESE UNFORTUNATE WRETCHES THAT AS A GENERAL THING ABOUT TEN PER CENT DIED OF SUFFOCATION ON THE VOYAGE
THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAS SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION OF DUTY WAS NATURALLY PRODUCED
THE SAINTS WERE DEAD
THE MEANEST THING CHARGED AGAINST THE DEVIL IS THAT HE LEADS THE CHILDREN OF MEN INTO TEMPTATION AND YET IN THE LORD'S PRAYER GOD IS INSULTINGLY ASKED NOT TO IMITATE THE KING OF FIENDS
HE HAD THE GOODNESS THE COURAGE ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED WITH PRISONS AND INQUISITIONS AND IN THE MIDST OF MILLIONS OF FIERCE BIGOTS TO DECLARE THE INNOCENCE OF HONEST ERROR AND THAT EVERY MAN HAD A RIGHT TO WORSHIP THE GOOD GOD IN HIS OWN WAY
IT HAS CRUMBLED
IT IS THE COMPASS OF THE MIND THE EVER-CONSTANT NORTHERN STAR THE MOUNTAIN PEAK THAT LIFTS ITSELF ABOVE ALL CLOUDS
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
IT APPEALED TO FORCE
IGNORANCE LIKE A MANTLE COVERED THE WORLD AND SUPERSTITION RAN RIOT WITH THE HUMAN IMAGINATION
BACK OF DISEASE MISFORTUNE AND DEATH HE PLACED A MALICIOUS FIEND
TO BE CONSISTENT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE THANKED HIM EQUALLY FOR BOTH
THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN BY SEVERAL SCIENTISTS BUT MOST CLEARLY MOST FORCIBLY BY BUECHNER
EVERY CHILD SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT USEFUL WORK IS WORSHIP AND THAT INTELLIGENT LABOR IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF PRAYER
THE SON WAS BEGOTTEN BY THE FATHER BUT EXISTED BEFORE HE WAS BEGOTTEN--JUST THE SAME BEFORE AS AFTER
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO DO AWAY WITH ALL CRUELTY
NOTHING WAS OF IMPORTANCE EXCEPT FAITH CREDULITY--BELIEF
PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS FALL UPON THEIR KNEES AND BECOME THE PUPPETS OF THE DIVINELY CROWNED
CRIMINALS WERE DRAWN AND QUARTERED
NO MAN OF SENSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD BELIEVES IN DEVILS ANY MORE THAN HE DOES IN MERMAIDS VAMPIRES GORGONS HYDRAS NAIADS DRYADS NYMPHS FAIRIES OR THE ANTHROPOPHAGI--ANY MORE THAN HE DOES IN THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE PERPETUAL MOTION OR FIAT MONEY
IS IT NOT MARVELOUS THAT MARK AND LUKE AND JOHN FORGOT TO MENTION THIS MOST HEARTLESS OF MASSACRES
THE POOR DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY WELL-DRESSED PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM AND THE RICH DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY NOBLE HEARTS BEAT BENEATH THE RAGS
I DO NOT KNOW BUT WE DO KNOW HOW GODS AND DEVILS HEAVENS AND HELLS HAVE BEEN MADE
THOUGHT IS A FORM OF FORCE CONSEQUENTLY IT COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED OR CREATED MATTER
WE KNOW THE PART THEY HAVE PLAYED
ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO RELYING ON HER GOD AND HIS PRIESTS ON CHARMS AND AMULETS ON HOLY WATER AND PIECES OF THE TRUE CROSS SHE WAGED WAR AGAINST THE GREAT REPUBLIC
IF THE BOOK IS INSPIRED WE MUST ACCEPT IT ALL
SOME FOR WHAT HE CALLS EVIL
I GAVE IT UP ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MIRACLES ITS CONTRADICTIONS BECAUSE CHRIST AND HIS DISCIPLES BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF DEVILS--TALKED AND MADE BARGAINS WITH THEM EXPELLED THEM FROM PEOPLE AND ANIMALS
PEOPLE FOUND IN THE POSSESSION OF BOOKS WERE OFTEN EXECUTED
NOT CONTENT WITH BINDING THE WREATH OF VICTORY UPON THE LEADER'S BROW THEY BANDAGED THE SOLDIERS WOUNDS THEY NERVED THE LIVING COMFORTED THE DYING AND SMILED UPON THE GREAT VICTORY THROUGH THEIR TEARS
I SEE THEM MAKE THEIR CRUEL CREEDS AND FILL THE WORLD WITH HATRED WAR AND DEATH
THE JEHOVAH OF THE JEWS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE MONSTER
AND THEN PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR HEART AND SAY WHETHER YOU CAN JUSTLY LOOK WITH CONTEMPT EVEN UPON A CONVICT
THAT THERE IS TO BE A GENERAL JUDGMENT WHEN THE SHEEP AND GOATS ARE TO BE DIVIDED
HE MUST NOT WASTE HIS ENERGIES IN ENDEAVORING TO ACCOMPLISH THE IMPOSSIBLE
WHEN ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS IT HAPPENS TO THEM
IT IS THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE WORLD THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT HAD NO MORTGAGE ON IT
THE FOUNDATION OF SUPERSTITION IS IGNORANCE THE SUPERSTRUCTURE IS FAITH AND THE DOME IS A VAIN HOPE
IN THESE LAY A GREAT MULTITUDE OF IMPOTENT FOLK--OF BLIND HALT WITHERED--WAITING FOR THE MOVING OF THE WATER
THEY SAY THAT THEY KNOW THAT CHRIST LIVED IN THE SAME WAY THAT THEY KNOW THAT CAESAR LIVED
I THANK THE INVENTORS AND MAKERS OF THE NUMBERLESS THINGS OF USE AND LUXURY
HAECKEL BEGAN AT THE SIMPLEST CELL WENT FROM CHANGE TO CHANGE--FROM FORM TO FORM--FOLLOWED THE LINE OF DEVELOPMENT THE PATH OF LIFE UNTIL HE REACHED THE HUMAN RACE
TIS NOT ENOUGH TO HELP THE FEEBLE UP BUT TO SUPPORT HIM AFTER RECOLLECT WHAT I SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE--THAT EVERY MAN IS AS HE MUST BE
IF THERE IS ANY LAW THAT OPPRESSES THEM IT IS THEIR FAULT
I FELT THAT I KNEW THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS THE WORK OF IGNORANT MEN--THAT IT WAS A MINGLING OF TRUTH AND MISTAKE OF WISDOM AND FOOLISHNESS OF CRUELTY AND KINDNESS OF PHILOSOPHY AND ABSURDITY--THAT IT CONTAINED SOME ELEVATED THOUGHTS SOME POETRY,---A GOOD DEAL OF THE SOLEMN AND COMMONPLACE,--SOME HYSTERICAL SOME TENDER SOME WICKED PRAYERS SOME INSANE PREDICTIONS SOME DELUSIONS AND SOME CHAOTIC DREAMS
WE HAD PLENTY OF THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE
AND WE FEEL THAT WE KNOW THIS AS CERTAINLY AS WE KNOW THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN THE DIAMETER AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE CAN NEVER CHANGE
THEN THE DISCIPLES ASKED HIM TO SEND HER AWAY AND HE SAID
IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO KEEP IN ALL THINGS THE LAW OF GOD
ON THAT SUBJECT THERE IS NO WORD
WONDER LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS WITH WIDE EYES AND IGNORANCE WITH OPEN MOUTH
WHAT HARM DOES SUPERSTITION DO?--THE HEART HARDENS AND THE BRAIN SOFTENS--WHAT SUPERSTITION HAS DONE AND TAUGHT--FATE OF SPAIN--OF PORTUGAL AUSTRIA GERMANY--VII
THEY HAVE FOUND THE CAUSE OF AND THE CURE FOR MANY MALADIES THAT AFFLICT THE FLESH AND MINDS OF MEN
MEN WHO DESERVE OUR THANKS--THE INFIDELS PHILANTHROPISTS AND SCIENTISTS--THE DISCOVERERS AND INVENTORS--MAGELLAN--COPERNICUS--BRUNO--GALILEO--KEPLER HERSCHEL NEWTON AND LAPLACE--LYELL--WHAT THE WORLDLY HAVE DONE--ORIGIN AND VICISSITUDES OF THE BIBLE--THE SEPTUAGINT--INVESTIGATING THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE--IV
THE SEEDS WERE ALL SOWN THE LAND THOROUGHLY PLOWED THE CROP WELL ATTENDED TO AND CAREFULLY HARVESTED
I HAVE TROUBLE EVERY DAY
NOTHING GIVES ME GREATER JOY THAN TO KNOW THAT THIS BELIEF IN ETERNAL PAIN IS GROWING WEAKER EVERY DAY--THAT THOUSANDS OF MINISTERS ARE ASHAMED OF IT
WILL SOME CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR TELL US WHICH TO BELIEVE
THESE STORIES ABOUT DEVILS DEMONSTRATE THE HUMAN THE IGNORANT ORIGIN OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
SHE WAS ALSO CHARGED WITH NURSING DEMONS
NOTHING LIVES EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS WILL AND YET THE DEVILS DO NOT DIE
CHRISTIANS DID NOT ASK THESE QUESTIONS
THE OLDEST MANUSCRIPT WE HAVE IN HEBREW WAS WRITTEN IN THE 10TH CENTURY AFTER CHRIST
THE SUN HAS BECOME AN ARTIST PAINTING WITH SHINING BEAMS THE VERY THOUGHTS WITHIN OUR EYES
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH IS A CHILD OF THE SUN--THAT THE EARTH AS WELL AS THE OTHER PLANETS BELONGING TO OUR CONSTELLATION CAME FROM THE SUN
THE CONTRADICTIONS ARE TOO MANY TOO GLARING
DID THEY REALLY EXIST
ALL THAT ARE BORN SHOULD BE SINCERELY WELCOMED
BELIAL PRINCE OF MISCHIEF-MAKERS
I THINK THAT THEY WERE GOOD MEN
IGNORANCE POVERTY AND VICE MUST STOP POPULATING THE WORLD
THE STRIKE IS NO REMEDY
CHRISHNA WAS A SUN-GOD
NO TEA NO COFFEE
THE INVENTOR OF MATCHES DID MORE FOR THE COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE OF MANKIND THAN ALL THE FOUNDERS OF RELIGIONS AND THE MAKERS OF ALL CREEDS--THAN ALL MALICIOUS MONKS AND SELFISH SAINTS
THE THIRD STONE IS THAT MATTER AND FORCE CANNOT EXIST APART--NO MATTER WITHOUT FORCE--NO FORCE WITHOUT MATTER
THE SUN WAS THE SKY FATHER THE ALL SEEING THE SOURCE OF LIFE--THE FIRESIDE OF THE WORLD
THESE LOVING WOMEN GAVE THEIR HEARTS TO A PHANTOM THEIR LIVES TO A DREAM
THAT THERE IS NO SALVATION WITHOUT BAPTISM
BODI-NUS A LAWYER IN FRANCE ABOUT THE SAME TIME ADVOCATED SOMETHING LIKE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BUT PUBLIC OPINION WAS OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST HIM AND THE PEOPLE WERE AT ALL TIMES READY WITH TORCH AND BRAND CHAIN AND FAGOT TO GET THE ABOMINABLE HERESY OUT OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT A MAN HAD A RIGHT TO THINK FOR HIMSELF
IT BECOMES A KIND OF INSANITY
HE WAS A PANTHEIST AN ATHEIST AN HONEST MAN
THEY WARM THEIR HANDS AT THE IMAGINARY FIRES OF HELL
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE TRINITY
IF ALL THERE IS IS NAUGHT BUT DROSS WE WANT TO KNOW AND BEAR OUR LOSS
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE SACRED BOOK THAT CAN HELP THE GEOLOGIST THE ASTRONOMER THE BIOLOGIST THE PHYSICIAN THE INVENTOR--THE MANUFACTURER OF ANY USEFUL THING
THE CROSS WAS A SYMBOL THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE OUR ERA
THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE
IS THERE A SENSIBLE MAN IN THE WORLD WHO BELIEVES THAT DAVID COLLECTED SEVEN THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOLD OR SILVER
FROM THE SIMPLEST CREATURES FROM BLIND SENSATION FROM ORGANISM FROM ONE VAGUE WANT TO A SINGLE CELL WITH A NUCLEUS TO A HOLLOW BALL FILLED WITH FLUID TO A CUP WITH DOUBLE WALLS TO A FLAT WORM TO A SOMETHING THAT BEGINS TO BREATHE TO AN ORGANISM THAT HAS A SPINAL CHORD TO A LINK BETWEEN THE INVERTEBRATE TO THE VERTEBRATE TO ONE THAT HAS A CRANIUM--A HOUSE FOR A BRAIN--TO ONE WITH FINS STILL ONWARD TO ONE WITH FORE AND HINDER FINS TO THE REPTILE MAMMALIA TO THE MARSUPIALS TO THE LEMURES DWELLERS IN TREES TO THE SIMIAE TO THE PITHECANTHROPI AND LASTLY TO MAN
HE GAVE COUNTLESS WORLDS TO OUR EYES AND MADE US CITIZENS OF THE UNIVERSE
I THANK VOLTAIRE WHOSE THOUGHT LIGHTED A FLAME IN THE BRAIN OF MAN UNLOCKED THE DOORS OF SUPERSTITION'S CELLS AND GAVE LIBERTY TO MANY MILLIONS OF HIS FELLOW-MEN
AND THAT IS ALL THAT THE RIGHT SHOULD EVER ASK--A FREE PRESS FREE SPEECH AND THE PROTECTION OF PERSON
THEY DECLARED THAT SCOTLAND WAS SO CALLED AFTER SCOTA A DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH WHO LANDED IN IRELAND AND AFTERWARD INVADED SCOTLAND AND TOOK IT BY FORCE OF ARMS
BY THE HOMESTEAD LAWS A HOME OF A CERTAIN VALUE OR OF A CERTAIN EXTENT IS EXEMPT FROM FORCED LEVY OR SALE
LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD ANOTHER SAID
I ADMIT THAT THIS UNKNOWN WRITER WAS SINCERE THAT HE WROTE WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE TRUE--THAT HE DID THE BEST HE COULD
CAN WE LOVE THE UNKNOWN THE INCONCEIVABLE
INTELLIGENCE IS THE ONLY LIGHT
IF WE EVER TAKE IT WE MUST PAY FOR IT--CONDEMN IT AND TAKE IT--DO NOT ROB ANYBODY
SO JOSEPH TOOK MARY AND THE CHILD TO EGYPT AND REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE DEATH OF HEROD
REASON ABDICATES AND SUPERSTITION WEARS HER CROWN
WE KNOW WHAT THESE MEN--FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST--HAVE DONE
IT MIGHT BE ASKED
WE READ BY THE GLARE OF HELL
THAT THEY GUARD THE INNOCENT PROTECT THE GOOD
I TELL YOU NAY BUT RATHER DIVISION
ALL OUR SYMPATHIES SHOULD BE WITH THE MEN WHO WORK WHO TOIL
THE APOSTLES LIKE THEIR FELLOWS BELIEVED IN MIRACLES AND MAGIC
BUT HONEST MEN DO NOT PRETEND TO KNOW
WEARING HIS LIFE OUT THAT SOMEBODY MAY SAY HOW RICH HE IS WHAT CAN HE DO WITH THE SURPLUS
BECAUSE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE ACCORDING TO LAW AND ORDER
HE DIED AND IN HELL HE LIFTED UP HIS EYES BEING IN TORMENT
IN DEFEAT THEY HAVE CRAWLED AND WHINED
ARE THE HEAVENS A REAL PLACE
THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW BUT SHOULD BE DILIGENT IN BUSINESS
TO SUCCEED THE THEOLOGIANS INVADE THE CRADLE THE NURSERY
I COMMAND THEE THOU UNCLEAN SPIRIT IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER OF THE SON AND OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT THOU COME OUT AND DEPART FROM THIS INFANT WHOM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST HAS VOUCHSAFED TO CALL TO HIS HOLY BAPTISM TO BE MADE A MEMBER OF HIS BODY AND OF HIS HOLY CONGREGATION AT THAT TIME THE FATHERS--THE THEOLOGIANS THE COMMENTATORS--AGREED THAT UNBAPTIZED CHILDREN INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE BORN DEAD WENT TO HELL
A PAGAN BENEATH THE DRAWN SWORD OF A CHRISTIAN WOULD PROBABLY CHANGE HIS RELIGIOUS VIEWS AND A CHRISTIAN WITH A SCIMITAR ABOVE HIS HEAD MIGHT SUDDENLY BECOME A MOHAMMEDAN BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT BOTH WOULD REMAIN EXACTLY AS THEY WERE BEFORE--EXCEPT IN SPEECH
FOR CENTURIES THE BUSINESS OF CHRISTIANS WAS TO WREST FROM THE FOLLOWERS OF MOHAMMED THE EMPTY SEPULCHER OF CHRIST
HOMES FOR ALL-MAKE A NATION OF HOUSEHOLDERS--MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE-VI
GODWIN THE EARL OF KENT DURING THE REIGN OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR APPEALED TO THE CORSNED WHICH STICKING IN HIS THROAT PRODUCED DEATH
IN THE BIBLE GOD IS SPOKEN OF AS A PERSON IN THE FORM OF MAN JOURNEYING FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS HAVING A HOME AND OCCUPYING A THRONE
THAT YOU SHOULD MURDER UNBELIEVERS
FIRST_.--DID AN INFINITE GOD CREATE THE CHILDREN OF MEN
THEY TRIED TO DO AWAY WITH INFANCY AND YOUTH WITH PRATTLE OF BABES AND THE SONG OF THE MORNING
THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH IT CAN BE ESTABLISHED
THE BELIEF IN GODS AND DEVILS HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY UNIVERSAL
THE EMOTIONAL SERMONS THE SAD SINGING THE HYSTERICAL AMENS THE HOPE OF HEAVEN THE FEAR OF HELL CAUSED MANY TO LOSE THE LITTLE SENSE THEY HAD
WHEN THE CLERGY WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE KING THEY CREATED DISSENSION BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE NOBLES BY TELLING THEM THAT THE NOBLES WERE TYRANTS
SEVEN THOUSAND MILLIONS
THE LAVA OF FREEDOM LONG BURIED BENEATH A MOUNTAIN OF WRONG AND INJUSTICE AT LAST BURST FORTH OVERWHELMING THE POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM OF PRIESTCRAFT AND TYRANNY
HAD THE WRITERS OF THE TESTAMENT BEEN REGARDED AS UNINSPIRED HAD CHRIST BEEN THOUGHT OF ONLY AS A MAN HAD THE GOOD BEEN ACCEPTED AND THE ABSURD THE IMPOSSIBLE AND THE REVENGEFUL THROWN AWAY MANKIND WOULD HAVE ESCAPED THE WARS THE TORTURES THE SCAFFOLDS THE DUNGEONS THE AGONY AND TEARS THE CRIMES AND SORROWS OF A THOUSAND YEARS
DID THEY TEACH THEIR FELLOW-MEN HOW TO MAKE A LIVING HOW TO OVERCOME THE OBSTRUCTIONS OF NATURE HOW TO PREVENT SICKNESS--HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM PAIN FROM FAMINE FROM MISERY AND RAGS
HE INFLICTED THE WOUNDS THAT CHRIST CAME TO HEAL
IT GIVES ME JOY TO KNOW THAT CHRISTIANS ARE BECOMING MERCIFUL SO MERCIFUL THAT THE FIRES OF HELL ARE BURNING LOW--FLICKERING CHOKED WITH ASHES DESTINED IN A FEW YEARS TO DIE OUT FOREVER
THE MAN OF STRAW CLOSED THE MOUTH OF PROF SMITH AND HE HAS NOT OPENED IT SINCE
I DO NOT SAY AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THE CHURCH WAS DISHONEST THAT THE CLERGY WERE INSINCERE
NO SENSIBLE HUMAN BEING NOW BELIEVES IN WITCHCRAFT
IT WILL DESTROY BIGOTRY IN ALL ITS FORMS
THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD AND EVIL CAME FROM THE SAME BEING
THE TRAVELER STANDING AMID THE RUINS OF ANCIENT CITIES AND EMPIRES SEEING ON EVERY SIDE THE FALLEN PILLAR AND THE PROSTRATE WALL ASKS WHY DID THESE CITIES FALL WHY DID THESE EMPIRES CRUMBLE
IT DEFIES OBSERVATION AND IS INDEPENDENT OF EXPERIENCE
HE PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM ALL AND THAT JUDGMENT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED BY THE INTELLIGENT WORLD
AND I AM ASHAMED TO SAY THAT WHIPPING HAS NOT BEEN ABOLISHED IN OUR SCHOOLS
THE POPES AND CARDINALS THE BISHOPS PRIESTS AND PARSONS ARE ALL USELESS
HE DID NOT THANK HIM FOR SENDING THE YELLOW FEVER
UPON THIS QUESTION PUBLIC SENTIMENT SHOULD BE AROUSED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THESE CORPORATIONS WOULD BE ASHAMED TO USE A HUMAN LIFE AND THEN THROW AWAY THE BROKEN OLD MAN AS THEY WOULD CAST ASIDE A ROTTEN TIE
THEY ARE NO LONGER TRUE TO THEMSELVES
TAKE THIS DEVIL FROM THAT BOOK AND ALL MEANING PLOT AND PURPOSE FADE AWAY
TO BELIEVE IS HIS ONLY DUTY
ACCORDING TO ANOTHER HE WAS SEEN BY THE WOMEN BY HIS DISCIPLES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND BY HUNDREDS OF OTHERS
TAUGHT ALL THE KNEELINGS GENUFLECTIONS AND PROSTRATIONS
REAL RELIGION AND REAL WORSHIP
HOW CAN WE LESSEN CRIME
THERE IS HARDLY FIVE THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS OF GOLD NOW USED AS MONEY IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG IN A GOVERNMENT WHERE THEY WHO DO THE MOST HAVE THE LEAST
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMMENTATORS HAVE OBSCURED AND DARKENED THE MEANING OF THE PLAINEST TEXTS SPIRITUALIZED DATES NAMES NUMBERS AND EVEN GENEALOGIES
HE DID NOT WRITE WHAT HE FELT BUT WHAT HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO FEEL
BUT THE LABORER DOES NOT OWN THE MACHINE
DO THEY GO TO SOME OTHER WORLD ARE THEY ANNIHILATED OR CAN THEY GET TO HEAVEN BY BELIEVING ON CHRIST
THEN I STUDIED GEOLOGY--NOT MUCH JUST A LITTLE--JUST ENOUGH TO FIND IN A GENERAL WAY THE PRINCIPAL FACTS THAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AND SOME OF THE CONCLUSIONS THAT HAD BEEN REACHED
MATTHEW SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE DATE OF THE BIRTH EXCEPT THAT HE WAS BORN WHEN HEROD WAS KING
CAN WE BELIEVE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLES
REASON WAS A TREMBLING COWARD AND EVERY PRODUCTION OF THE MIND WAS DEFORMED EVERY IDEA WAS A MONSTER
SOME OF THE PREACHERS WHO HAVE ANSWERED ME SAY THAT I AM FIGHTING A MAN OF STRAW
PAUL CALLS THE DEVIL THE PRINCE OF THE POWER OF THE AIR SO IN JUDE WE ARE TOLD THAT MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL WHEN CONTENDING WITH THE DEVIL HE DISPUTED ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES DURST NOT BRING AGAINST HIM A RAILING ACCUSATION BUT SAID THE LORD REBUKE THEE WAS THIS DEVIL WITH WHOM MICHAEL CONTENDED A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL OR A POEM OR A MYTH
ALL ORTHODOX CHURCHES OF ALL AGES HAVE BEEN THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE
AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT ALL RELIGIONS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME--PRODUCED BY THE SAME CAUSES--THAT ALL REST ON A MISCONCEPTION OF THE FACTS IN NATURE--THAT ALL ARE FOUNDED ON IGNORANCE AND FEAR ON MISTAKE AND MYSTERY
THE PRESENT LIVES THE PAST IS DEAD AND WE ARE HERE ALL WELCOME GUESTS AT LIFE'S GREAT FEAST WE NEED NO HELP FROM GHOST OR PRIEST
THE ONLY ONE WHO SUFFERED DEATH FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUTH
INTELLIGENCE IS A FORM OF FORCE AND COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT OR APART FROM MATTER
TAKE THE DEVIL FROM THE SCHEME OF SALVATION--FROM THE ATONEMENT--FROM THE DOGMA OF ETERNAL PAIN--AND THE FOUNDATION IS GONE
THE REWARD WAS TO BE ETERNAL AND SO WAS THE PUNISHMENT
IT LOOKS AS IF YOU COULD SPEND THERE LONG TRANQUIL AUTUMN DAYS
THEY OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE,--NOTHING BUT PROMISES AND THREATS
THE CHURCH IS NOT FREE
HE DENOUNCED HIS WIFE AS A WITCH SHE CONFESSED THE CRIME AND WAS BURNED AT THE STAKE
THE GEOLOGIST PENETRATES THE ROCKS IN SEARCH OF FACTS--CLIMBS MOUNTAINS VISITS THE EXTINCT CRATERS TRAVERSES ISLANDS AND CONTINENTS THAT HE MAY KNOW SOMETHING OF THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
THIS OUTSIDE CIRCLE WAS THE LAND INHABITED BY THE OLD WORLD BEFORE THE FLOOD
THE WORSHIPERS RECEIVE NO HELP
THERE TOO WERE THE OGRES THE JAKSHAS AND MANY OTHERS WHO KILLED AND DEVOURED HUMAN BEINGS
I WILL TELL YOU
WHY NOT PUNISH A MAN FOR HAVING THE CONSUMPTION
BUT LET ME ASK THE CLERGY A FEW QUESTIONS
WE CANNOT RELY UPON LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENTS TO MAKE PEOPLE WISE AND GOOD
BUT THERE IS STILL ANOTHER QUESTION
AFTER A WHILE WHAT THEY WERE PLEASED TO CALL FLYING COACHES WERE ESTABLISHED
I KNOW THEE
THOUSANDS OF MYSTERIES WERE EXPLAINED AND SCIENCE WRESTED THE SCEPTRE FROM SUPERSTITION
IN THE SACRED EAST THE DAWN APPEARED
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LABOR IS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL AND THAT THOSE WHO LABOR ARE THE CARYATIDES THAT SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE AND GLITTERING DOME OF CIVILIZATION AND PROGRESS
THAT HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH SIRIUS THE NORTH STAR WITH CAPELLA OR THAT HE KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CLUSTERS OF STARS SO FAR AWAY THAT THEIR LIGHT NOW VISITING OUR EYES HAS BEEN TRAVELING FOR TWO MILLION YEARS
FORCE COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED BEFORE MATTER
THE GREAT POEMS PAINTINGS INVENTIONS THEORIES AND PHILOSOPHIES ENLARGE AND MOULD THE MIND OF MAN
HE DEMONSTRATED THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE--THE KINSHIP OF ALL THAT LIVES AND GROWS--THAT BREATHES AND THINKS
I AM JUST TELLING HOW IT IS
HE IS TOLD ABOUT A GOD WHO MADE THE WORLD AND WHO REWARDS AND PUNISHES
IF THE DEVIL IS A PERSONIFICATION SO IS HELL AND THE LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
SOME OF THE ROMAN NOBLES WERE THE OWNERS OF AS MANY AS TWENTY THOUSAND SLAVES
THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SO-CALLED COPY OF PART OF THE BIBLE KNOWN AS THE SAMARITAN ROLL OF THE PENTATEUCH
OUR FOREFATHERS USED TO RID THEMSELVES OF RATS LEECHES LOCUSTS AND VERMIN BY PRONOUNCING WHAT THEY CALLED A PUBLIC EXORCISM
POVERTY MAKES CRIME
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE HEART WILL DRIVE WANT AND CRIME FROM THE WORLD
WE HAVE GOT INTO THAT CONTEST BETWEEN MACHINES-AND MEN AND IF EXTRAVAGANCE DOES NOT KEEP PACE WITH INGENUITY IT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST TERRIBLE QUESTION THAT MAN HAS EVER SETTLED
BY THE SAME BOOK THEY PROVED THAT NEARLY EVERYBODY IS TO BE LOST AND THAT ALL ARE TO BE SAVED
THAT LIKE EVER HAS AND EVER WILL PRODUCE LIKE
WE ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE THIS A FREE GOVERNMENT IN THE BROADEST SENSE TO GIVE LIBERTY TO ALL
THEY TOLD THEIR HEARERS TO BELIEVE TO HAVE FAITH TO GIVE THEIR HEARTS TO GOD THEIR SINS TO CHRIST WHO WOULD BEAR THEIR BURDENS AND MAKE THEIR SOULS AS WHITE AS SNOW
NO LONGER WHISPER WORDS OF COMFORT TO THE HELPLESS
THINK OF ALL THE CRIMES YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED IF YOU HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
LET US LOVE AND LABOR
THEY HATE ART--ABHOR THE MARBLES OF THE GREEKS AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE HUMAN FORM
IN THE HANDS OF SCIENCE A DROP OF WATER HAS BECOME A GIANT TURNING WITH SWIFT AND TIRELESS ARM THE COUNTLESS WHEELS
IN REVELATION THE INSANEST OF ALL BOOKS I FIND THE FOLLOWING
HE GOT IN LOVE WITH THE DAUGHTER AND WANTED TO MARRY HER
WHERE DOES THIS DEVIL LIVE
THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE
AND THEY WERE GLAD AND COVENANTED TO GIVE HIM MONEY ACCORDING TO CHRIST THE LITTLE DEVILS KNEW THAT HE WAS THE SON OF GOD
ONLY A FEW KINDS OF CROPS WERE RAISED
WHAT WERE UNCLEAN SPIRITS SUPPOSED TO BE
TO THIS THERE IS BUT ONE ANSWER
THEY WERE CALLED FANATICS BY MEN WHO WERE SO INSANE AS TO SUPPOSE THAT THE LAWS OF A PETTY PRINCE WERE GREATER THAN THOSE OF THE UNIVERSE
THERE WERE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES THREE GREAT CLASSES OF PEOPLE
AND WHY SHOULD WE EXPRESS OUR HONEST THOUGHTS
IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE REFORMATION OF THE WORLD IN SPITE OF ALL THE INVENTIONS IN SPITE OF ALL THE FORCES OF NATURE THAT ARE NOW THE TIRELESS SLAVES OF MAN IN SPITE OF ALL IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE IN MECHANICS IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN LABOR THE WORLD IS STILL CURSED WITH POVERTY AND WITH CRIME
THE SCENE SHIFTS
THE TELESCOPE WAS INVENTED
CHRIST WAS A NEW NAME FOR AN OLD BIOGRAPHY--A SURVIVAL--THE LAST OF THE SUN-GODS
THEY HAVE WRITTEN SACRED BOOKS PERFORMED MIRACLES BUILT CATHEDRALS AND DUNGEONS
THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED TO JOSEPH IN A DREAM AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE MARY AND THE CHILD INTO EGYPT FOR FEAR OF HEROD
WE MADE A WHIP-PING-POST OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST
THEY ENSLAVE THE MINDS OF MEN
BELIEF IS AND FOREVER MUST BE THE RESULT OF EVIDENCE
ELIZABETH'S ORDER CONCERNING CLERGYMEN AND SERVANT GIRLS--INVENTIONS OF WATT ARKWRIGHT AND OTHERS--SOLOMON'S DEPRIVATIONS--LANGUAGE CHAPTER ON)--BELIEF THAT THE HEBREW WAS< THE ORIGINAL TONGUE--SPECULATIONS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF PARADISE--GEOGRAPHY CHAPTER ON)--THE WORKS OF COSMAS--PRINTING INVENTED--CHURCH'S OPPOSITION TO BOOKS--THE INQUISITION--THE REFORMATION--"SLAVERY CHAPTER ON)--VOLTAIRE'S REMARK ON SLAVERY AS A CONTRACT--WHITE SLAVES IN GREECE ROME ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND FRANCE--FREE MINDS MAKE FREE BODIES--CAUSES OF THE ABOLITION OF WHITE SLAVERY IN EUROPE--THE FRENCH REVOLUTION--THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE ITS BEGINNING AND END--LIBERTY TRIUMPHED CHAPTER HEAD)--ABOLITION OF CHATTEL SLAVERY--CONCLUSION
POSSIBLY WATER WAS TURNED INTO WINE LOAVES AND FISHES INCREASED AND POSSIBLY DEVILS WERE EXPELLED FROM MEN AND WOMEN
THE GREAT POETS WHOSE THOUGHTS HAVE CHARMED THE SOULS THE GREAT PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS WHO HAVE MADE THE CANVAS SPEAK THE MARBLE LIVE
YET THE CHRISTIAN'S GOD ALLOWED HIS ENEMIES TO TORTURE AND BURN HIS FRIENDS HIS WORSHIPERS
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CHARGED WITH BEING IN LEAGUE WITH THE DEVIL CONFESSED THE CRIME GAVE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE BARGAIN TOLD JUST WHAT THE DEVIL SAID AND WHAT THEY REPLIED AND EXACTLY HOW THE BARGAIN WAS CONSUMMATED ADMITTED IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE GRAVE WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THE CONFESSION WOULD CONFISCATE ALL THEIR PROPERTY AND LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN HOMELESS WANDERERS AND RENDER THEIR OWN NAMES INFAMOUS AFTER DEATH
IT WAS ALL NATURAL
SO IN THE INFANCY OF THE RACE WANTS AND PASSIONS DOMINATE
FOAM AND BLOOD ISSUE FROM HIS MOUTH
IF HE DOES NOT EAT HE CANNOT THINK
EVERY SCHOOL SHOULD BE A MENTAL GYMNASIUM
HE SEES CRIME CROWNED AND HYPOCRISY ROBED
IN VICTORY THEY HAVE KILLED
THAT DAY AND NIGHT WOULD STILL PURSUE EACH OTHER AROUND THE WORLD
IS NOT WHAT WE CALL MIND JUST AS NATURAL AS WHAT WE CALL BODY
IT MAKES CHRIST AS MERCILESS AS THE FANGS OF A VIPER
TO TAKE YOUR BABE UPON YOUR KNEE AND SAY
I BELIEVE THAT WITH INFINITE ARMS NATURE EMBRACES THE ALL--THAT THERE IS NO INTERFERENCE--NO CHANCE--THAT BEHIND EVERY EVENT ARE THE NECESSARY AND COUNTLESS CAUSES AND THAT BEYOND EVERY EVENT WILL BE AND MUST BE THE NECESSARY AND COUNTLESS EFFECTS
THEY KNEW THAT LIFE HAD ONE PATH AND ONE ROAD
IT PREACHED SALVATION BY FAITH AND DECLARED THAT ONLY ORTHODOX BELIEVERS COULD BECOME ANGELS AND ALL DOUBTERS WOULD BE DAMNED
EVERY LITTLE BRAIN BECOMES A MENAGERIE FILLED WITH WILD BEASTS FROM HELL
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE WRITINGS OF THE DEVOUT AND INSINCERE THE PIOUS AND PETRIFIED THE PURE AND HEARTLESS
IN THE BRAIN OF INNOCENCE THEY PLANT THE SEEDS OF SUPERSTITION
FOR THERE IS NO MAN WHICH SHALL DO A MIRACLE IN MY NAME THAT CAN LIGHTLY SPEAK EVIL OF ME IN THE FOURTH CHAPTER OF LUKE THE STORY OF THE TEMPTATION OF CHRIST BY THE DEVIL IS AGAIN TOLD WITH A FEW ADDITIONS
WHAT BECAME OF THEM AND THEIR STAR
NOTHING HAS BEEN MORE BLASPHEMOUS THAN THE EXPRESSION OF HONEST THOUGHT
AGAIN I SAY THAT IF THE DEVIL DOES NOT EXIST THE GOSPELS ARE NOT INSPIRED
BY ALL THE HOPES FOR THE FUTURE
IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A PROMISE TAKE THE PLACE OF EVIDENCE
THAT SERMON DID SOME GOOD
NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL DISEASES ARE NATURALLY PRODUCED AND THAT ALL REMEDIES ALL CURATIVES ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACTS IN NATURE
ALL THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED AS EARLY AS 1534
THEY FILL THEIR HEARTS WITH FEAR
THE CHURCH HAS BEEN THE ENEMY OF EVERY SCIENCE OF EVERY REAL THINKER AND FOR MANY CENTURIES HAS USED HER POWER TO PREVENT INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS
THE OLD MAN WAS NOT FRIGHTENED
I THANK THE GREAT PAINTERS
WHY HAS HE WITHHELD HIS RAIN AND STARVED MILLIONS OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN
THIS TRANSLATION WAS MADE BY SEVENTY PERSONS
THERE WILL NEVER BE A GENERATION OF GREAT MEN UNTIL THERE HAS BEEN A GENERATION OF FREE WOMEN--OF FREE MOTHERS
IT IS ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND ALWAYS WITH PURE UNALLOYED HAPPINESS
WOULD A DECENT MAN HAVING THE POWER TO PREVENT IT ALLOW HIS ENEMIES TO TORTURE AND BURN HIS FRIENDS
THAT THEY BEND OVER THE CRADLES AND GIVE HEALTH AND HAPPY DREAMS TO PALLID BABES
THEY SAID TO HIM
THIS GOD VISITED THE PEOPLE WITH PESTILENCE--FILLED THE HOUSES AND COVERED THE STREETS WITH THE DYING AND THE DEAD--SAW BABES STARVING ON THE EMPTY BREASTS OF PALLID MOTHERS HEARD THE SOBS SAW THE TEARS THE SUNKEN CHEEKS THE SIGHTLESS EYES THE NEW MADE GRAVES AND REMAINED AS PITILESS AS THE PESTILENCE
THIS PIECE OF LAND WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY WATER WHICH WAS THE OCEAN AND BEYOND THE STRIP OF WATER WAS ANOTHER CIRCLE OF LAND
BEYOND THIS THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HOPE
WHAT HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF CHRISTIANITY IN ITALY IN SPAIN IN PORTUGAL IN IRELAND
THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT THE FLOOD--KNEW THAT GOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EIGHT DROWNED ALL HIS CHILDREN--THE OLD AND YOUNG--THE BOWED PATRIARCH AND THE DIMPLED BABE--THE YOUNG MAN AND THE MERRY MAIDEN--THE LOVING MOTHER AND THE LAUGHING CHILD--BECAUSE HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER
IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THE PROPERTY DEDICATED TO THIS PURPOSE IS WORTH AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS
THE GRAND WORK WENT FORWARD IN DENMARK IN SWEDEN AND IN ENGLAND
IT IS SAID THAT JOSEPH WAS TOLD SO IN A DREAM BY AN ANGEL
THEY HAVE LOST THEIR POWER BUT THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE IMPOSSIBLE
IF THIS GOD EXISTS HOW DO WE KNOW HE IS GOOD?--SHOULD BOTH THE INFERIOR AND THE SUPERIOR THANK GOD FOR THEIR CONDITION?--III
THE STEAM ENGINE WAS CONSTRUCTED AND NOW STEAM THE GREAT SLAVE DOES THE WORK OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MEN
AND THAT TO LIVE A FREE AND JOYOUS LIFE DEPENDING ON FACT INSTEAD OF FAITH IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT GODS AND DEVILS EXIST
THE MORNING OF FREEDOM BEGAN TO DAWN
TO BELIEVE IN FORCE APART FROM SUBSTANCE OR IN SUBSTANCE APART FROM FORCE
I MUST GIVE YOU MY HONEST THOUGHT
THEY FOUND THAT ALL THE SACRED BOOKS WERE FILLED WITH INSPIRED MISTAKE AND SACRED ABSURDITY
TO CAUSE A MIRROR TO REFLECT THE FACES OF PERSONS WHO STAND BEHIND IT INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO STAND IN FRONT WOULD BE A MIRACLE
HE MADE RACES DIFFERING IN INTELLIGENCE STATURE AND COLOR
BETWEEN THIS SO-CALLED CAUSE AND THE SO-CALLED EFFECT THERE IS SO FAR AS WE CAN SEE NO POSSIBLE RELATION
HARK
AND THAT DIVISION IS GROWING MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY THE GULF BETWEEN LAZARUS AND DIVES WIDENS YEAR BY YEAR ONLY THEIR POSITIONS ARE CHANGED--LAZARUS IS IN HELL AND HE THINKS DIVES IS IN THE BOSOM OF ABRAHAM
HELP OTHERS HELP THEMSELVES
THE IMPOSSIBLE AND ABSURD THE CRUEL AND THE INFAMOUS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY THROWN ASIDE AND THOUSANDS ARE NOW ENGAGED IN TRYING TO SAVE THE INSPIRED WORD
THEY TELL US NOW THAT ALL IS GOOD
THESE GREAT COMPANIES SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE MEN THEY MAIM
TO KNOW THAT THE LOVED AND DEAD ARE NOT LOST
NOTHING FOR LUCKY OR UNLUCKY JEWELS DAYS OR NUMBERS
IF WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MISTAKEN LET US HAVE THE HONESTY AND COURAGE TO SAY SO
LUTHER BELIEVED THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN THE DEVIL NOT ONLY BUT THAT HE HAD HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM UPON POINTS OF THEOLOGY
THEY ARE THE BABBLING BUILDERS OF ANOTHER BABEL A BABEL OF MUD UPON A FOUNDATION OF SAND
AS A NECESSITY YOU PROVIDE A PLACE FOR HIM
MORE COULD NOT BE SAID
CREDIT GOES
IT WAS DURING THE DRIFT PERIOD THAT THESE FORMS OF LIFE EXISTED IN EUROPE AND ENGLAND AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
CERTAIN PRIVILEGES HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO THE FEW BY THE GOVERNMENT OSTENSIBLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE MANY
IN THE RAINY SEASON THE ROADS WERE ALMOST IMPASSABLE
IF MATTHEW WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THE GENEALOGY OF CHRIST ABOUT THE WISE MEN THE STAR THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT AND THE MASSACRE OF THE BABES BY HEROD,--THEN HE MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IN MANY PASSAGES THAT HE PUT IN THE MOUTH OF CHRIST
MERESIN PRINCE OF AERIAL DEVILS WHO CAUSED THUNDERSTORMS AND PLAGUES
ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LONDON THERE WAS A TRACT TWENTY-FIVE MILES ROUND ALMOST IN A STATE OF NATURE
IF A MINISTER WERE TO PROVE HIS CREED THAT WOULD BE A THEOLOGICAL MIRACLE
IF GOD GOVERNS THE WORLD WHY SHOULD WE CREDIT HIM FOR THE GOOD AND NOT CHARGE HIM WITH THE EVIL
PASSING OVER THE HINDUS THE EGYPTIANS THE GREEKS AND ROMANS THEIR POETS PHILOSOPHERS AND METAPHYSICIANS--WE WILL COME TO MODERN TIMES
FIVE HE GOES AWAY OF COURSE THE FLOWER DID NOT GROW AND THE NUMBER OF ITS LEAVES WAS NOT DETERMINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE COURTSHIP OR MARRIAGE OF THIS GIRL NEITHER COULD THERE HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE THAT GUIDED HER HAND WHEN SHE SELECTED THAT PARTICULAR FLOWER
THIS ADDRESS WAS DELIVERED BEFORE THE MILITANT CHURCH AT THE COLUMBIA THEATRE CHICAGO ILLS APRIL 12 1896
ON THE OUTSIDE LAND WAS A HIGH MOUNTAIN AROUND WHICH THE SUN AND MOON REVOLVED
CREDULITY IS THE GREATEST OF VIRTUES AND DOUBT THE DEADLIEST OF SINS
THAT THEY WILL BE SAVED
ACCORDING TO THE CHRISTIANS THESE ANGELS WERE SPIRITS
THIS WAS THE BEGINNING
AND ALL THIS FOR THE TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM A BUILDING NINETY FEET LONG AND FORTY-FIVE FEET HIGH AND THIRTY WIDE TO WHICH WAS ATTACHED A PORCH THIRTY FEET WIDE NINETY FEET LONG AND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FEET HIGH
ACCORDING TO LUKE JOSEPH AND MARY LIVED IN NAZARETH AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING THEM TO BETHLEHEM SO THAT THE CHILD COULD BE BORN IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE TAXING UNDER CYRENIUS WAS USED BUT THE WRITER BEING INSPIRED MADE A MISTAKE OF ABOUT TEN YEARS AS TO THE TIME OF THE TAXING AND OF THE BIRTH
ALL WHO DOUBTED OR DENIED WOULD BE LOST
AS LONG AS THE HUMAN RACE EXISTS MEN AND WOMEN WILL LOVE EACH OTHER AND JUST SO LONG THERE WILL BE TRUE AND PERFECT MARRIAGE
THE SPECTRUM ANALYSIS THAT TELLS US OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE SUN
THEY CARE NOTHING FOR THE OPINIONS OF ANCESTORS NOTHING FOR CREEDS ASSERTIONS AND THEORIES UNLESS THEY SATISFY THE REASON
AT TOULOUSE IN FRANCE THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUILT AN ARK AND STOCKED IT WITH PROVISIONS AND IT WAS NOT TILL LONG AFTER THE DAY UPON WHICH THE FLOOD WAS TO HAVE COME HAD PASSED THAT THE PEOPLE RECOVERED FROM THEIR FRIGHT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES
THE MEN ON ONE ISLAND THE WOMEN ON ANOTHER
IS THAT ALL THAT CIVILIZATION CAN DO
BACK OF THESE FORCES OUR ANCESTORS PUT WILL INTELLIGENCE AND DESIGN
SUPPOSE YE THAT I AM COME TO GIVE PEACE ON EARTH
HE TAUGHT THEM TO SACRIFICE OXEN SHEEP AND DOVES TO THE END THAT THEIR SINS MIGHT BE FORGIVEN
THEY THOUGHT THAT FLOOD AND FAMINE PLAGUE AND CYCLONE EARTHQUAKE AND WAR WERE SOMETIMES SENT BY GOD AS PUNISHMENT FOR UNBELIEF
SUPERSTITION IS A BEGGAR--A ROBBER A TYRANT
THAT ALL THE JEWS ARE GOING TO PERDITION
IF IT BE GOOD FOR MAN TO FIND THE TRUTH--GOOD FOR HIM TO BE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST AND HOSPITABLE THEN IT IS GOOD FOR OTHERS TO KNOW THE TRUTHS THUS FOUND
THEY HATE TO WALK ALONE
HE WAS MENTALLY WEAK MENTALLY INDOLENT AND HIS MIND PURSUED THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE
HE KNOWS THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT IS FILLED WITH ALLUSIONS TO THE DEVIL TO EVIL SPIRITS AND THAT THE NEW TESTAMENT IS THE SAME
THEY DREW AND CHISELED THEIR HOOFS THEIR HORNS--ALL THEIR MALICIOUS DEFORMITIES
THESE WINGED GUARDIANS NO LONGER PROTECT THE INNOCENT
WHAT IS SUPERSTITION?--POPULAR BELIEFS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SIGNS LUCKY AND UNLUCKY NUMBERS DAYS ACCIDENTS JEWELS ETC.--ECLIPSES EARTHQUAKES AND CYCLONES AS OMENS--SIGNS AND WONDERS OF THE HEAVENS--EFFICACY OF BONES AND RAGS OF SAINTS--DISEASES AND DEVILS--II
THAT THIS EXCITED THE HATRED OF THOSE IN POWER AND THAT CHRIST WAS ARRESTED TRIED AND CRUCIFIED
THEY KNEW TOO THAT HE DROWNED THE BEASTS AND BIRDS--EVERYTHING THAT WALKED OR CRAWLED OR FLEW--BECAUSE HIS LOVING KINDNESS IS OVER ALL HIS WORKS
MAKE FRIENDS
TO THESE MEN WE ARE INDEBTED FOR ALL WE ARE FOR ALL WE KNOW FOR ALL WE HAVE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER HAD THE NEW TESTAMENT NEVER BEEN WRITTEN--FAR BETTER HAD THE THEOLOGICAL CHRIST NEVER LIVED
JEHOVAH WAS WICKED ENOUGH AND MALICIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE THE DEVIL'S PLACE
HOW WAS IT PRODUCED
FATHER ABRAHAM
FATHER ABRAHAM
FATHER ABRAHAM
FATHER ABRAHAM
WAS NEVER TEMPTED NEVER TOUCHED BY FEAR OR HOPE AND NEVER HAD A WANT
YOU HAVE ADMITTED THAT ITS HISTORY IS UNTRUE
A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE BELIEF WAS GENERAL THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN HEALING VIRTUES IN INANIMATE THINGS IN THE BONES OF HOLY MEN AND WOMEN IN THE RAGS THAT HAD BEEN TOM FROM THE FOUL CLOTHING OF STILL FOULER SAINTS IN HAIRS FROM MARTYRS IN BITS OF WOOD AND RUSTY NAILS FROM THE TRUE CROSS IN THE TEETH AND FINGER NAILS OF PIOUS MEN AND IN A THOUSAND OTHER SACRED THINGS
IN 1608 LIPPERSHEIM A HOLLANDER SO ARRANGED LENSES THAT OBJECTS WERE EXAGGERATED
WAS IT HIS INTENTION TO BE PUT TO DEATH
THAT HE IS OUR FATHER AND THAT HE LOVES AND CARES FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
THERE WERE SOME SCOFFERS AND NOW AND THEN SOME MAN HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT THE THREATS OF PRIESTS AND MAKE A JEST OF HELL
BUT THEY SAY IF YOU GIVE UP THESE SUPERSTITIONS WHAT HAVE YOU LEFT LET ME NOW GIVE YOU THE DECLARATION OF A CREED
MICHAEL AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT AGAINST THE DRAGON AND THE DRAGON FOUGHT AND HIS ANGELS
THE COMMON PEOPLE OF FRANCE WERE IN SLAVERY FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
WHERE THEN WAS THIS GOLD THIS SILVER FOUND
THE LIGHTNING BECAME A CARRIER OF THOUGHT AND THE NATIONS BECAME NEIGHBORS
THIS WORLD WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE COMPARED WITH THE NEXT
THESE GOOD SPIRITS SUSTAINED THE SAME RELATION TO GOD THAT THE EVIL ONES DID TO THE DEVIL
IF THAT BOOK IS NOT TRUE IF ITS AUTHORS WERE UNAIDED MEN IF IT CONTAINS BLUNDERS AND FALSEHOODS THEN THAT STONE CRUMBLES TO DUST
WHAT IS MATTER--SUBSTANCE
AND THESE LAWS HAVE DONE GREAT GOOD
HE COULD NOT BUY ANOTHER BREATH
MR THOMAS FROM THE METHODIST CHURCH
IN THOSE TIMES THEY ALSO BELIEVED IN LYCANTHROPY--THAT IS THAT PERSONS OF WHOM THE DEVIL HAD TAKEN POSSESSION COULD ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF WOLVES
THE ONLY REASON GIVEN IS THAT FRIDAY IS AN UNLUCKY DAY
TO BUILD HOMES
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO HIS SERVICE
IT ESTABLISHES NO FACT ANSWERS NO OBJECTION AND DISSIPATES NO DOUBT
ALL THIS WAS THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCE
NATIONS HOWEVER SUSTAIN THE RELATIONS OF SAVAGES TO EACH OTHER
IN THIS WORD IS THE DIVINE MINGLING OF ECSTASY AND AGONY--OF LOVE AND SELF-SACRIFICE
THEY WANT LIBRARIES MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES CLOSED ON THE SABBATH
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BELIEF ALL EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE THE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE WERE UTTERLY FRUITLESS
FOR THESE REASONS THEY ARE DUST
THEY KNEW THAT THESE DEVILS WERE CITIZENS OF HELL
HE MUST PROTECT HIMSELF BY FINDING THE FACTS IN NATURE BY DEVELOPING HIS BRAIN TO THE END THAT HE MAY OVERCOME THE OBSTRUCTIONS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FORCES OF NATURE
IT IS BY THIS THAT FROM THE LOG OR PIECE OF BARK ON WHICH A NAKED SAVAGE FLOATED WE HAVE BY SUCCESSIVE IMPROVEMENTS CREATED A MAN-OF-WAR CARRYING A HUNDRED GUNS AND MILES OF CANVAS
AND DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THEY WOULD ALLOW THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS TO DIE FOR WANT OF BREATH IF THEY COULD NOT PAY FOR AIR
HE CLINGS TO FACTS
YOU MARK HIM
THE SCEPTRE AND MITRE WERE IN HER HANDS AND YET HER SUCCESS WAS THE RESULT OF FORCE AND FRAUD AND IT CARRIED WITHIN ITSELF THE SEEDS OF ITS DEFEAT
IF I AM DEATH IS NOT
TWO HE TARRIES
THEN I SAID
IN THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER IS THE ACCOUNT OF THE WOMAN OF CANAAN WHO CRIED UNTO JESUS SAYING
THIS LIFE WAS TO BE SPENT IN PREPARING FOR THE LIFE TO COME
THINK OF THESE VAST DEPOSITS CAUSED BY THE SLOW FALLING OF INFINITESIMAL ATOMS OF IMPALPABLE DUST THROUGH THE SILENT DEPTHS OF ANCIENT SEAS
THE FATHER SAID YOU CANNOT HAVE MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE IT WOULD STAIN HER LIFE THE YOUNG MAN SAID YES IT WOULD STAIN HER LIFE THEREFORE I WILL NOT MARRY HER HE WENT OUT
DOES THE NEW TESTAMENT TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
FEW MEN HAVE INTELLIGENCE ENOUGH REAL GREATNESS ENOUGH TO OWN A GREAT FORTUNE
IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A DUMB AND DEAF DEVIL
THEY DID NOT ANSWER THEIR ARGUMENTS BUT THEY TORE THEIR CHARACTERS INTO SHREDS AND DEMONSTRATED BY THE FURY OF ASSERTION THAT THEY HAD DONE THE DEVIL'S WORK
THAT FROM THAT MOMENT THE TOMB BECAME THE DOOR THAT OPENS ON ETERNAL LIFE
IF WE THANK GOD OR NATURE FOR THE SUNSHINE AND RAIN FOR HEALTH AND HAPPINESS WHOM SHALL WE CURSE FOR FAMINE AND PESTILENCE FOR EARTHQUAKE AND CYCLONE--FOR DISEASE AND DEATH
THEY WROTE THE HISTORY OF EVERY COUNTRY OF ANY IMPORTANCE
NO TROUBLE NO THOUGHTS ABOUT NOTES ABOUT INTEREST--NOTHING OF THE KIND
AND WHEN I SAY THE GREATEST TRAGEDY EVERYBODY FAMILIAR WITH SHAKESPEARE WILL KNOW THAT I REFER TO KING LEAR AFTER HE HAS BEEN ON THE HEATH TOUCHED WITH INSANITY COMING SUDDENLY TO THE PLACE OF SHELTER HE SAYS
HE FILLS THE AIR AND WATER WITH THE INVISIBLE ENEMIES OF LIFE--THE MESSENGERS OF PAIN AND WATCHES THE PUPPETS AS THEY BREATHE AND DRINK
THE PEOPLE MUST OBEY
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN FORMED THE OBJECT BEING TO PAY THE EXPENSES AND SHARE THE PROFITS AMONG ALL THE PERSONS BELONGING TO THE SOCIETY
THEY HAVE FOUND THAT CHRISTIANITY IS LIKE THE REST--THAT IT WAS NOT A REVELATION BUT A NATURAL GROWTH--THAT ITS GODS AND DEVILS ITS HEAVENS AND HELLS WERE BORROWED--THAT ITS CEREMONIES AND SACRAMENTS WERE SOUVENIRS OF OTHER RELIGIONS--THAT NO PART OF IT CAME FROM HEAVEN BUT THAT IT WAS ALL MADE BY SAVAGE MAN
I COMPARED THE PLAYS WITH THE INSPIRED BOOKS--ROMEO AND JULIET WITH THE SONG OF SOLOMON LEAR WITH JOB AND THE SONNETS WITH THE PSALMS AND I FOUND THAT JEHOVAH DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ART OF SPEECH
THAT MONEY WILL NOT PURCHASE LOVE
YOU NEED NOT READ THE BIBLE
DID IT IN SOME WAY PARALYZE HIS ORGANS OF SPEECH
NEITHER IS THERE ANY DANGER OF DESTROYING IN THE HUMAN HEART THAT DIVINE THING CALLED LOVE
THE MOMENT A MAN GETS MONEY SO MANY MEN ARE TRYING TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE HE REGARDS THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE AS HIS ENEMY AND HE GENERALLY THINKS THAT THEY COULD BE RICH TOO IF THEY WOULD ONLY ATTEND TO BUSINESS AS HE HAS
FOR YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF ALL THESE THINGS ASK AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU
AND THIS HOLY BIBLE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN OR HEARD OF SINCE
CAN EVIDENCE OF THIS BE FOUND IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND
AND CAST HIM INTO THE BOTTOMLESS PIT AND SHUT HIM UP AND SET A SEAL UPON HIM THAT HE SHOULD DECEIVE THE NATIONS NO MORE TILL THE THOUSAND YEARS SHOULD BE FULFILLED
WHAT HARM ARE THEY DOING
CONCLUSION.--DECLARATION OF THE FREE
THE ORTHODOX GOD WHEN CLOTHED IN HUMAN FLESH TOLD HIS DISCIPLES NOT TO RESIST EVIL TO LOVE THEIR ENEMIES AND WHEN SMITTEN ON ONE CHEEK TO TURN THE OTHER AND YET WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS SAME GOD WITH THE SAME LOVING LIPS UTTERED THESE HEARTLESS THESE FIENDISH WORDS
THEY GAVE US THE TOOLS OF ALL THE TRADES--THE IMPLEMENTS OF LABOR
ALL THE MEANNESS OF WHICH THE HEART OF MAN IS CAPABLE IS IN THAT ONE WORD--HELL
IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY THE FOLLOWING LAW WAS IN FORCE IN ENGLAND
THERE IS HARDLY A MAN IN THE UNITED STATES TO-DAY OF ANY IMPORTANCE WHOSE VOICE ANYBODY CARES TO HEAR WHO WAS NOT NURSED AT THE LOVING BREAST OF POVERTY
WITHOUT LIBERTY THE BRAIN IS A DUNGEON WHERE THE CHAINED THOUGHTS DIE WITH THEIR PINIONS PRESSED AGAINST THE HINGELESS DOORS
THE PRIEST SPRINKLES HOLY WATER ON HER PALLID FACE SAYING
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT AFTER THAT TIME HE CRAWLED AND LIVED ON DUST
IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY THE VIRTUE IN THE BONE OR RAG OR PIECE OF WOOD CREPT OR FLOWED FROM THE BOX TOOK POSSESSION OF THE SICK WHO HAD THE NECESSARY FAITH AND IN THE NAME OF GOD DROVE OUT THE DEVILS WHO WERE THE REAL DISEASE
WE ARE ALL IN THEIR POWER
OTHERS WERE DISEMBOWELED AND HUNG AND THEIR BODIES SUSPENDED IN CHAINS TO ROT IN THE AIR
THE THEOLOGIANS HAD ALWAYS INSISTED THAT THEIR GOD WAS THE CREATOR OF ALL LIVING THINGS--THAT THE FORMS PARTS FUNCTIONS COLORS AND VARIETIES OF ANIMALS WERE THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS FANCY TASTE AND WISDOM--THAT HE MADE THEM ALL PRECISELY AS THEY ARE TO-DAY--THAT HE INVENTED FINS AND LEGS AND WINGS--THAT HE FURNISHED THEM WITH THE WEAPONS OF ATTACK THE SHIELDS OF DEFENCE--THAT HE FORMED THEM WITH REFERENCE TO FOOD AND CLIMATE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL FACTS AFFECTING LIFE
IF YE FORGIVE MEN THEIR TRESPASSES YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL ALSO FORGIVE YOU
THE CHURCH REGARDED EPIDEMICS AS THE MESSENGERS OF THE GOOD GOD
YET FOR MANY AGES MAN IN ALL DIRECTIONS HAS RELIED UPON AND SINCERELY BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL
WE NOW KNOW OUR ANCESTORS OUR PEDIGREE
IT MADE THE WIFE A SLAVE--THE PROPERTY OF THE HUSBAND AND IT PLACED THE HUSBAND AS MUCH ABOVE THE WIFE AS CHRIST WAS ABOVE THE HUSBAND
SO BELIEVING THEY WERE THE ENEMIES OF FREE THOUGHT AND SPEECH--THEY CARED NOTHING FOR CONSCIENCE NOTHING FOR THE VERACITY OF A SOUL,--NOTHING FOR THE MANHOOD OF A MAN
IF THE BIBLE IS INSPIRED IS IT TRUE
WE HAD THE BOOK OF MARTYRS SHOWING THAT CHRISTIANS HAD FOR MANY CENTURIES IMITATED THE GOD THEY WORSHIPED
ALL OF THESE GODS WERE BORN IN HUMBLE PLACES--IN CAVES UNDER TREES IN COMMON INNS AND TYRANTS SOUGHT TO KILL THEM ALL WHEN THEY WERE BABES
WE REGARD THEM BOTH AS NECESSITIES
DON'T LET HIM TALK LIKE THE REST OF THE MERCHANTS BECAUSE HE IS A MERCHANT
FREE FROM SANCTIFIED MISTAKES AND HOLY LIES
WHAT BECAME OF THIS BIBLE
ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY LUTHER AND JEROME OF PRAGUE INAUGURATED THE GREAT REFORMATION IN GERMANY ZISKA WAS AT WORK IN HUNGARY ZWINGLIUS IN SWITZERLAND
WAS THE WATER OF BETHESDA TROUBLED BY AN ANGEL
PIOUS BEGGARS WILL BECOME HONEST AND USEFUL MEN
THEY HAVE BUILT HOSPITALS AND ASYLUMS UNIVERSITIES AND SCHOOLS AND SEEM TO HAVE DONE THEIR VERY BEST TO MAKE MANKIND BETTER AND HAPPIER AND YET THEY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED
IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN MIGHT WAS RIGHT AND WHEN KINGS AND POPES STOOD BY THE PEOPLE AND PROTECTED THE PEOPLE AND TALKED ABOUT HOLY OIL AND DIVINE RIGHT THE WORLD WAS FILLED WITH SLAVES
THEY FIND THE ACCOUNT IN A BOOK
I READ CRUDEN WHO MADE THE GREAT CONCORDANCE AND MADE THE MIRACLES AS SMALL AND PROBABLE AS HE COULD
TO CIVILIZE THE WORLD TO HASTEN THE COMING OF THE GOLDEN DAWN OF THE PERFECT DAY WE MUST EDUCATE THE CHILDREN WE MUST COMMENCE AT THE CRADLE AT THE LAP OF THE LOVING MOTHER
HE WILL DRIVE WANT AND CRIME FROM THE WORLD
THERE WERE NO LAMPS IN THE STREETS BUT PLENTY OF HIGHWAYMEN AND ROBBERS
TIMID PREACHERS SULLY THEIR OWN SOULS WHEN THEY CHANGE WHAT THE WRITERS OF THE BIBLE BELIEVED TO BE FACTS TO ALLEGORIES PARABLES POEMS AND MYTHS
IT WAS THE LAW IN ENGLAND THAT ANY ONE CONVICTED OF A CRIME COULD APPEAL TO WHAT WAS CALLED CORSNED OR MORSEL OF EXECRATION
THE COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF THE ARMY OF CHARLES THE FIFTH RECOMMENDED THAT A SURVEY BE MADE OF THE COUNTRY BY COMPETENT MEN IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE HIGHEST LAND
AND AS THEY GO BY THE PALACES THAT POISON PLANT CALLED ENVY SPRINGS AND GROWS IN THEIR POOR HEARTS
BELIEF IN GOD AND SACRIFICE--DID AN INFINITE GOD CREATE THE CHILDREN OF MEN AND IS HE THE GOVERNOR OF THE UNIVERSE?--II
NOW ONE MAN IS NOT A SHOEMAKER
MENTAL VERACITY ABOVE ALL BELIEF
THEY BEGAN TO INVENT TO DISCOVER TO FIND THE RELATION BETWEEN FACTS THE CONDITIONS OF HAPPINESS AND THE MEANS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE WELL-BEING OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN
HE KNOWS THAT OPALS AFFECT THE WEARER THE SAME AS RUBIES DIAMONDS OR COMMON GLASS
FOR MANY AGES THE LIPS OF THE WISE WERE SEALED
THE CHURCH DENIES THE ETERNAL INEXORABLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
I AM AFRAID IT NEVER WILL BE
THEN I CONCLUDED THAT ALL RELIGIONS HAD BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED AND THAT ALL WERE VARIATIONS MODIFICATIONS OF ONE,--THEN I FELT THAT I KNEW THAT ALL WERE THE WORK OF MAN
THEY MADE CLOCKS OF VARIOUS KINDS AND WERE THE INVENTORS OF THE PENDULUM
YOU CAN NEVER GET IT BY STRIKES
WE MUST DISCARD THE MIRACLES OR ADMIT THAT HE WAS INSANE OR AN IMPOSTOR
THERE WAS FOR ME NO MASTER IN ALL THE WIDE WORLD--NOT EVEN IN INFINITE SPACE
THAT ADAM ANSWERED IN DANISH AND THAT THE SERPENT WHICH APPEARS QUITE PROBABLE SPOKE TO EVE IN FRENCH
REMEMBER THAT
SOME ONE SAID THAT A GRINDSTONE WOULD NOT FLOAT
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL A FEW MEN BEGAN TO THINK
THERE IS NOT A THING THAT MAN USES THAT CAN NOT INSTANTLY BE OVER-PRODUCED TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO BECOME ALMOST WORTHLESS
I THANK THE INDUSTRIOUS MEN THE LOVING MOTHERS THE USEFUL WOMEN
OUR GOD WAS MADE BY MEN SCULPTURED BY SAVAGES WHO DID THE BEST THEY COULD
THE HANDS THAT HELP ARE BETTER FAR THAN LIPS THAT PRAY
HAS MAN OBTAINED ANY HELP FROM HEAVEN
THE RELIGIOUS THE LUGUBRIOUS THE ARTIFICIAL THE SPIRITUAL POETS WERE FORGOTTEN OR REMAINED ONLY AS THE FRAGMENTS THE HALF REMEMBERED HORRORS OF MONSTROUS AND DISTORTED DREAMS
THEN I FELT SURE THAT THE INSPIRED RECORD WAS FALSE--THAT MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAD BEEN DECEIVED AND THAT ALL I HAD BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF WORLDS AND MEN WAS UTTERLY UNTRUE
TO CONQUER PAIN OR TO LENGTHEN LIFE
LET US HOPE THAT IF THERE BE ANOTHER LIFE IT WILL BRING PEACE AND JOY TO ALL THE CHILDREN OF MEN
THAT WORD MAKES THE CHRISTIAN'S GOD AN ETERNAL TORTURER AN EVERLASTING INQUISITOR--AN INFINITE WILD BEAST
THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT IT IS A WASTE OF ENERGY A WASTE OF THOUGHT A WASTE OF LIFE TO ACQUIRE WHAT YOU DO NOT NEED AND WHAT YOU DO NOT REALLY USE FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOURSELF OR OTHERS
IT SEEMS PROBABLE TO ME THAT THE FIRST ORGANIZED CEREMONIAL RELIGION WAS THE WORSHIP OF THE SUN
WHILE I HAVE LIFE AS LONG AS I DRAW BREATH I SHALL DENY WITH ALL MY STRENGTH AND HATE WITH EVERY DROP OF MY BLOOD THIS INFINITE LIE
IF HE HAS NO PASSIONS WHY IS HE SPOKEN OF AS JEALOUS REVENGEFUL ANGRY PLEASED AND LOVING
THESE CHURCHES ARE FOUNDED UPON IMMATERIAL DIFFERENCES
THEN ASSUMING A DRAMATIC ATTITUDE PUTTING HIS RIGHT HAND TO HIS EAR HE WHISPERED HARK
CAN IT BE OUR DUTY TO LOVE ANYBODY
HE HAS MADE NO PROGRESS
WE CALL THEM CRIMINALS LET ME TAKE ANOTHER STEP
THEY HAVE PERISHED AT THE STAKE IN PRISONS BY FAMINE AND BY SWORD
PROGRESS
PROGRESS
BEYOND HIS INTELLECTUAL HORIZON HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO SEE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY BELIEVED IN WITCHCRAFT AND THAT PEOPLE OFTEN WERE POSSESSED OF SATAN AND WHEN THEY WERE ACCUSED THE FRIGHT AND CONSTERNATION PRODUCED BY THE ACCUSATION IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BELIEF OFTEN PRODUCED INSANITY OR SOMETHING AKIN TO IT AND THE POOR CREATURES CHARGED WITH A CRIME THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISPROVE DESERTED AND ABHORRED BY THEIR FRIENDS LEFT ALONE WITH THEIR SUPERSTITIONS AND FEARS DRIVEN TO DESPAIR LOOKED UPON DEATH AS A BLESSED RELIEF FROM A TORTURE THAT YOU AND I CANNOT AT THIS DAY UNDERSTAND
GOD PROTECT ALL OF US
LET US HOPE THAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING PEACE AND JOY TO ALL THE CHILDREN OF MEN AND ABOVE ALL LET US PRESERVE THE VERACITY OF OUR SOULS
THE ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO DO OUR BIDDING AND THE ELECTRIC SPARK FREIGHTED WITH HUMAN THOUGHT AND LOVE DEFIES DISTANCE AND DEVOURS TIME AS IT SWEEPS UNDER ALL THE WAVES OF THE SEA
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN WHO BELIEVES IN THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE DEVIL
THEY UNMASKED THE CORRUPTION AND WITHSTOOD THE TYRANNY OF THE CHURCH
THE SHADOW OF THIS CLUB FALLS ATHWART THE OPEN BIBLE--FALLS UPON THE PREACHER'S BRAIN DARKENS THE LIGHT OF HIS REASON AND COMPELS HIM TO BETRAY HIMSELF
HE ALSO HAS THE GOODNESS TO INFORM HIS READERS THAT NERO WAS IN THE HABIT OF VOMITING FROGS
NOW AND THEN ONE ROSE A LITTLE ABOVE HIS FELLOWS--USED HIS SENSES--THE LITTLE REASON THAT HE HAD--FOUND SOMETHING NEW--SOME BETTER WAY
TRUTH IS NEITHER YOUNG NOR OLD IS NEITHER ANCIENT NOR MODERN BUT IS THE SAME FOR ALL TIMES AND PLACES AND SHOULD BE SOUGHT FOR WITH CEASELESS ACTIVITY EAGERLY ACKNOWLEDGED LOVED MORE THAN LIFE AND ABANDONED--NEVER
I SHALL TALK ON THEIR SIDE I SHALL VOTE ON THEIR SIDE AND DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN TO CONVINCE MEN THAT HAPPINESS DOES NOT LIE IN THE DIRECTION OF GREAT WEALTH BUT IN THE DIRECTION OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE GOOD OF THEMSELVES AND FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN
THE BABBLE OF BROOKS THE SONGS OF BIRDS THE LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN WERE NOTHING TO THEM
I BEHELD A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH
IN 1441 PRINTING WAS INVENTED
LOVE IS THE EVER GLEAMING STAR THAT LEADS THE WAY THAT SHINES NOT ON VAGUE WORLDS OF BLISS BUT ON A PARADISE IN THIS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERY CHILD OF NATURE IS ENTITLED TO HIS SHARE OF THE LAND AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE COMPELLED TO BEG THE PRIVILEGE TO WORK THE SOIL OF A BABE THAT HAPPENED TO BE BORN BEFORE HIM
THE ONLY AUTHORITY IS NATURE--THE FACTS WE KNOW
TO KNOW THAT ALL THE PATHS THAT HUMAN BEINGS TRAVEL TURN AND WIND AS THEY MAY LEAD TO THE GATES OF STAINLESS PEACE
EVERYWHERE THE STRONG LIVING ON THE WEAK--THE SUPERIOR ON THE INFERIOR
NO MERCY IN THE HEART OF GOD
SO THEY TELL US THAT THE CHURCH HAS BUILT HOSPITALS
THERE WAS I BELIEVE ONE INVENTION DURING THESE AGES
KINDNESS IS THE SUNSHINE IN WHICH VIRTUE GROWS
WE KNOW THAT IT WAS A DELUSION
ONLY A FEW IN THE WILD RAGE OF IGNORANCE FEAR AND ZEAL PRESERVED THE PERFECT CALM THAT WISDOM GIVES
IN NATURE I SEE OR SEEM TO SEE GOOD AND EVIL--INTELLIGENCE AND IGNORANCE--GOODNESS AND CRUELTY--CARE AND CARELESSNESS--ECONOMY AND WASTE
THE REAL PHILANTHROPIST DOES NOT DESPISE ALL NATIONS BUT HIS OWN
AND THIS BREEDS RASCALITY ON BOTH SIDES
IS THE WHOLE ACCOUNT AFTER ALL AN IGNORANT DREAM
ON ONE SIDE IS THE DEVIL WITH THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE IN HIS HANDS
WHAT VALUABLE FACT HAS BEEN PROCLAIMED FROM AN ORTHODOX PULPIT
1860-64 THE PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD DEPENDS UPON ITS WORKERS--VENERATION FOR THE ANCIENT--CREDULITY AND FAITH OF THE MIDDLE AGES--PENALTY FOR READING THE SCRIPTURE IN THE MOTHER TONGUE--UNJUST BLOODY AND CRUEL LAWS--THE REFORMERS TOO WERE PERSECUTORS--BIGOTRY OF LUTHER AND KNOX--PERSECUTION OF CASTALIO--MONTAIGNE AGAINST TORTURE IN FRANCE--"WITCHCRAFT CHAPTER ON)--CONFESSED WIZARDS--A CASE BEFORE SIR MATTHEW HALE--BELIEF IN LYCANTHROPY--ANIMALS TRIED AND EXECUTED--ANIMALS RECEIVED AS WITNESSES--THE CORSNED OR MORSEL OF EXECUTION--KEPLER AN ASTROLOGER--LUTHER'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE DEVIL--MATHEMATICIAN STOEFFLERS ASTRONOMICAL PREDICTION OF A FLOOD--HISTORIES FILLED WITH FALSEHOOD--LEGEND ABOUT THE DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH INVADING SCOTLAND AND GIVING THE COUNTRY HER NAME--A STORY ABOUT MOHAMMED--A HISTORY OF THE BRITAINS WRITTEN BY ARCHDEACONS--INGENUOUS REMARK OF EUSEBIUS--PROGRESS IN THE MECHANIC ARTS--ENGLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY--BARBAROUS PUNISHMENTS--QUEEN
THE ASYLUMS WERE PRISONS DUNGEONS THE INSANE WERE VICTIMS AND THE KEEPERS WERE IGNORANT CONSCIENTIOUS PIOUS FIENDS
HOW CAN WE REFORM THE WORLD
THAT YOU SHOULD LEND TO ALL WHO ASK AND THAT ONE WHO DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD IS WORSE THAN AN INFIDEL
THEY HAVE DEGRADED THE POETIC CHANGED PARABLES TO HISTORY AND IMAGERY TO STUPID AND IMPOSSIBLE FACTS
I WOULD GIVE THE WIFE A DIVORCE IF SHE REQUESTED IT IF SHE WANTED IT
WE CRY IN VAIN
YET HE PRETENDS TO BE A TEACHER--A LEADER ONE SELECTED BY GOD TO EDUCATE HIS FELLOW-MEN
I STOOD ERECT AND FEARLESSLY JOYOUSLY FACED ALL WORLDS
THINK OF THE FEARFUL NIGHTS--NIGHTS FILLED WITH PHANTOMS WITH FLYING CRAWLING MONSTERS WITH HISSING SERPENTS THAT SLOWLY UNCOILED WITH VAGUE AND FORMLESS HORRORS WITH BURNING AND MALICIOUS EYES
NO WONDER THAT THE TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY QUENCHED HOPE'S GREAT STAR AND LEFT HIS BROKEN HEART IN THE DARKNESS OF DESPAIR
THAT YOU MUST NOT RESIST EVIL
GOD KNEW WHAT HE WOULD DO WITH HIS FREEDOM WHEN HE MADE HIM AND GAVE HIM LIBERTY OF ACTION AND AS A MATTER OF FACT MUST HAVE MADE HIM WITH THE INTENTION THAT HE SHOULD REBEL
IN THOSE TIMES THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF EITHER MIND OR BODY IN EUROPE
HE CONSIDERED UNIVERSAL TOLERATION AN ERROR SO DID MELANCTHON AND ERASMUS AND YET STRANGE AS IT MAY APPEAR THEY WERE EXERCISING THE VERY RIGHT THEY DENIED TO OTHERS AND MAINTAINING THEIR RIGHT WITH A COURAGE AND ENERGY ABSOLUTELY SUBLIME
INJUSTICE TRIUMPHS
GREEK STATUES WERE HANDED OVER TO PURITAN STONE MASONS TO BE MADE DECENT
THE SERMONS WERE MOSTLY ABOUT THE PAINS AND AGONIES OF HELL THE JOYS AND ECSTASIES OF HEAVEN SALVATION BY FAITH AND THE EFFICACY OF THE ATONEMENT
YOU REMEMBER THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO MADE A SPEECH AT A SOCIALIST MEETING AND CLOSED IT BY SAYING THANK GOD I AM NO MONOPOLIST BUT AS HE SANK TO HIS SEAT SAID BUT I WISH TO THE LORD I WAS WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THESE RICH MEN ARE NATURALLY PRODUCED
THE SPECTATORS SAY
THE CRIMINAL SHOULD BE CONFINED AND IF POSSIBLE SHOULD BE REFORMED
INGERSOLL THE HANDS THAT HELP ARE BETTER FAR THAN LIPS THAT PRAY IN TWELVE VOLUMES VOLUME IV
THEY WERE EATING BERRIES ROOTS BARK AND VERMIN
STRONGHOLD AFTER STRONGHOLD WAS CARRIED AND IN A FEW SHORT BUT TERRIBLE YEARS THE BANNER OF THE REFORMATION WAVED IN TRIUMPH OVER THE BLOODY ENSIGN OF SAINT PETER
COULD THIS BE ACCOMPLISHED THEN A REASONABLE RATE OF COMPENSATION COULD BE FIXED AND ENFORCED
IT BRANDED MAIMED AND MUTILATED--IT IMPRISONED AND TORTURED--IT BLINDED AND BURNED HANGED AND CRUCIFIED AND UTTERLY DESTROYED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS
WHY DID GOD CREATE THOSE ANGELS KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD REBEL
SCIENCE IS THE REAL REDEEMER
THE BELIEF HAS BECOME IGNORANT AND VULGAR
I AM FIGHTING THE SUPERNATURAL--THE DOGMA OF INSPIRATION--THE BELIEF IN DEVILS--THE ATONEMENT SALVATION BY FAITH--THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND THE SAVAGERY OF ETERNAL PAIN
TO SIMPLY OBEY IS TO PRACTICE WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A SLAVE VIRTUE
HE WAVES HIS WAND AND HE WHO DESERVES THE TORTURES OF HELL RECEIVES AN ETERNAL REWARD
THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE AND WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARKNESS OF NATURE WITHOUT THE CONSOLATION OF HELL
IF WE SAY THAT THE DEVIL WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL ARE WE NOT AT THE SAME TIME COMPELLED TO SAY THAT JEHOVAH WAS A PERSONIFICATION OF GOOD
LORD HELP ME BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID
IT IS SAID THAT PTOLEMY SOTER AND HIS SON PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS OBTAINED A TRANSLATION OF THE JEWISH BIBLE
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS SAID THAT ALL GHOSTS VANISHED AT THE DAWN OF DAY
THE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD AND OF A DEVIL IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME
SHAKESPEARE WHO SOUNDED EVERY DEPTH--WHILE ON THE LOFTIEST PEAK THERE FELL THE SHADOW OF HIS WINGS
HE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE HONEST
I WOULD NOT THAT YE SHOULD HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH DEVILS
THERE ARE VERY MANY WHO HAVE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SUPERNATURAL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH REAL RELIGION
ON ONE OCCASION GETTING EXCITED HE THREW AN INKSTAND AT HIS MAJESTY'S HEAD AND THE INK STAIN IS STILL TO BE SEEN ON THE WALL WHERE THE STAND WAS BROKEN
I SEE THE GREEKS BUILDING TEMPLES FOR ZEUS NEPTUNE AND VENUS
THE CHRISTIANS OF THE MIDDLE AGES THE MEN WHO WERE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST KNEW ALL ABOUT THE WORLDS BEYOND THE GRAVE BUT NOTHING ABOUT THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY LIVED
CHRIST WAS A SUN-GOD
THEY FELL UPON THEIR KNEES--DID THEIR BEST WITH SACRIFICE AND PRAYER TO AVOID THE THREATENED DISASTER
HE OPENS THE EARTH AND THEY ARE DEVOURED
FREEDOM DISCUSSION HONESTY INVESTIGATION AND COURAGE ARE THE FRIENDS AND ALLIES OF TRUTH
PURCHASE FLATTERY AND LIES
THE TIDE OF VICE IS RISING
IT WAS BURNED IN THE BRUCHIUM LIBRARY FORTY-SEVEN YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
AND THAT THIS WAS ALL DONE UNDER THE SACRED NAME OF LIBERTY BY A REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT THAT WAS FOUNDED UPON THE SUBLIME DECLARATION THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUAL
COULD HE KNOW THAT THE VISITOR WAS AN ANGEL
IT MADE THE UNIVERSE A MADHOUSE PRESIDED OVER BY AN INSANE GOD
IT MAKES MAN AN ETERNAL VICTIM AND GOD AN ETERNAL FIEND
IT HAS USED ITS INFLUENCE WITH GOD TO GET RAIN AND SUNSHINE--TO STOP FLOOD AND STORM--TO KILL INSECTS RATS SNAKES AND WILD BEASTS--TO STAY PESTILENCE AND FAMINE--TO DELAY FROST AND SNOW--TO LENGTHEN THE LIVES OF KINGS AND QUEENS--TO PROTECT PRESIDENTS--TO GIVE LEGISLATORS WISDOM--TO INCREASE COLLECTIONS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
ANOTHER WASTE
A FEW ARE RESCUED BY CHANCE OR CHARITY BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY ARE FAILURES THEY BECOME VICIOUS FEROCIOUS
THEN THE TRANSLATION OF ENOCH SEEMED REASONABLE ENOUGH AND NO ONE DOUBTED THAT BEFORE THE FLOOD THE SONS OF GOD CAME DOWN AND MADE LOVE TO THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN
THERE IS ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD REMEMBER AT THE START AND IF I CAN ONLY TEACH YOU THAT TO-NIGHT--UNLESS YOU KNOW IT ALREADY--I SHALL CONSIDER THE FEW WORDS I MAY HAVE TO SAY A WONDERFUL SUCCESS
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY A MAN WAS BURNED IN FRANCE BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO KNEEL TO A PROCESSION OF DIRTY MONKS
WAS THIS DEVIL WHO TEMPTED DAVID A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL OR WAS JEHOVAH A PERSONIFICATION OF THE DEVILISH
HE SIMPLY STATED THE FACTS AS HE UNDERSTOOD THEM
BEELZEBUB PRINCE OF THE FALSE GODS OF THE OTHER NATIONS
IT WILL NOT DO TO SAY THAT THIS IS ALLEGORY OR A POEM BECAUSE THIS PROVES TOO MUCH
TO PLANT SEEDS THAT WILL FOREVER BEAR THE FRUIT OF JOY IS NOT AN ACT OF SELF-DENIAL
IN THE NAME OF CHRIST WHO THREATENED ETERNAL REVENGE IT HAS PREACHED FORGIVENESS
BUT SAY SOME THESE WORKINGMEN ARE DANGEROUS I DENY IT
HE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE DAWN--A MAIDEN
AND IF A HUMAN BEING SUPPORTS HIMSELF AND ACQUIRES A SURPLUS LET HIM USE A PART OF THAT SURPLUS FOR THE UNFORTUNATE
THE HINDUS EGYPTIANS GREEKS AND ROMANS HAD HOLY WATER LONG BEFORE A CATHOLIC LIVED
I ADMIT THAT THERE ARE MANY GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL PASSAGES IN THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT
AND THEN I VOWED TO GRASP THE TORCH THAT THEY HAD HELD AND HOLD IT HIGH THAT LIGHT MIGHT CONQUER DARKNESS STILL
AND YET THEOLOGIANS POPES PRIESTS PARSONS WHO SPEECHLESS STAND BEFORE THE WONDER OF THE SMALLEST THING THAT IS KNOW ALL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF WORLDS KNOW WHEN THE BEGINNING WAS WHEN THE END WILL BE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE GOD WHO WITH A WISH CREATED ALL KNOW WHAT HIS PLAN AND PURPOSE WAS THE MEANS HE USES AND THE END HE SEEKS
IMAGINE A MAN IN THIS CITY AN INTELLIGENT MAN SAY WITH TWO OR THREE MILLIONS OF COATS EIGHT OR TEN MILLIONS OF HATS VAST WAREHOUSES FULL OF SHOES BILLIONS OF NECKTIES AND IMAGINE THAT MAN GETTING UP AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IN THE RAIN AND SNOW AND SLEET WORKING LIKE A DOG ALL DAY TO GET ANOTHER NECKTIE
DECLARATION OF THE FREE WE HAVE NO FALSEHOODS TO DEFEND WE WANT THE FACTS
EPILEPSY AND HYSTERIA WERE PRODUCED BY THE IMPS OF SATAN
GO TO ENGLAND
I SEE THEM CAPTURED AND ENSLAVED
THE WITHERED HANDS OF WANT WILL NOT BE STRETCHED FOR ALMS
VOLTAIRE WHO SIDED WITH THE OPPRESSED RESCUED THE UNFORTUNATE CHAMPIONED THE OBSCURE AND WEAK CIVILIZED JUDGES REPEALED LAWS AND ABOLISHED TORTURE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
FOR A TIME I LEFT THE DREAMS THE INSANITIES THE ILLUSIONS AND DELUSIONS THE NIGHTMARES OF THEOLOGY
THE WOMEN COULD CARRY THEIR KNITTING AND SEWING
THE CIVILIZED WORLD HAS IMPOVERISHED ITSELF AND THE DEBT OF CHRISTENDOM MOSTLY FOR WAR IS NOW NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SHOW THAT OUR BIBLE IS CORRECT
OF COURSE THE THEOLOGIANS FOUGHT THE FACTS FOUND BY THE GEOLOGISTS THE SCIENTISTS AND SOUGHT TO SUSTAIN THE SACRED SCRIPTURES
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IT EMPLOYED EVERY ART AND ARTIFICE THAT CUNNING COULD SUGGEST IT INFLICTED EVERY CRUELTY BY EVERY MEANS THAT MALICE COULD INVENT
NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE THE MIRACLES MAY SEEM YOU MUST BELIEVE
YES
YES
DOES ANYONE KNOW THAT THIS GOD EXISTS
THEY BOUGHT AND SOLD THE BODIES AND SOULS OF MEN AND THE MOURNFUL WINDS OF DESOLATION SIGHING AMID THEIR CRUMBLING RUINS IS A VOICE OF PROPHETIC WARNING TO THOSE WHO WOULD REPEAT THE INFAMOUS EXPERIMENT
WHO CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
THE SECOND STONE IS THAT FORCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
LET PHILOSOPHY ALONE COUNT YOUR BEADS
MIRACLES ARE NOT SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE BUT THEY ARE UNTHINKABLE BY ANY MAN CAPABLE OF THINKING
AS A LAST ANSWER AS A FINAL EXCUSE THE WORSHIPERS OF JEHOVAH SAID THAT ALL THESE HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPENED UNDER THE OLD DISPENSATION OF UNYIELDING LAW AND ABSOLUTE JUSTICE BUT THAT NOW UNDER THE NEW DISPENSATION ALL HAD BEEN CHANGED--THE SWORD OF JUSTICE HAD BEEN SHEATHED AND LOVE ENTHRONED
WHAT KIND OF SAINTS WERE THEY
THE ENSLAVEMENT OF THE BODY
SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE BECOME CIVILIZED GREAT CORPORATIONS WILL MAKE PROVISION FOR MEN WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO THEIR SERVICE
DID THEY EXPLAIN ANY OF THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
THE STUDENT OF THIS SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY MUST BE TAUGHT IN YOUTH,--IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS
THIS IS BAD LUCK TO SEE THE MOON OVER THE RIGHT OR LEFT SHOULDER OR NOT TO SEE IT COULD NOT BY ANY POSSIBILITY AFFECT THE MOON NEITHER COULD IT CHANGE THE EFFECT OR INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON ANY EARTHLY THING
YET ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS WERE PUT IN THE FIELD
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE ADAM WAS CERTAINLY THE FIRST MAN AND IN HIS CASE THE EPOCH THEORY CANNOT CHANGE THE ACCOUNT
THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ASSERTIONS OF THE CHURCH
WE MUST NOT BUILD ON GUESSES FANCIES ANALOGIES OR INFERENCES
THEN COME WANT AND FAMINE AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE CHILD DIE IT WOULD TAKE THEM YEARS TO SAVE ENOUGH OF THEIR EARNINGS TO PAY THE EXPENSE OF PUTTING AWAY THAT LITTLE SACRED PIECE OF FLESH
THEY WERE THE FOLLOWERS FOR THE MOST PART OF AN IMPOSTOR--OF A PRETENDED PROPHET OF A FALSE GOD
WHAT GOOD MAN HAVING THE POWER TO PREVENT IT WOULD ALLOW THE INNOCENT TO BE IMPRISONED CHAINED IN DUNGEONS AND SIGH AGAINST THE DRIPPING WALLS THEIR WEARY LIVES AWAY
THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BELIEVE THESE THINGS AND TO LOVE GOD
IN FACT HE ARRANGED EVERYTHING HIMSELF AND BROUGHT EVERYTHING TO PASS JUST AS HE HAD PREDESTINED IT AN ETERNITY BEFORE THE WORLD WAS
I SEE THE HALF-GOD MEN--THE MOURNFUL CHRISTS IN MANY LANDS
THAT THE DARKNESS WAS FILLED WITH IMPS FROM PERDITION AND THE DAY WITH ANGELS FROM HEAVEN
I SEE THEM WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS--WITH REVERENTLY CLOSED EYES--WORSHIPING THE SUN
IN OTHER WORDS THE QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED
I AM COME TO SEND FIRE ON THE EARTH
AND YET IN THE UNITED STATES GOOD AS WE ARE NEARLY EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET EVERYTHING FOR A LITTLE LESS THAN IT IS WORTH AND THE MAN THAT SELLS IT TO HIM WANTS TO GET A LITTLE MORE THAN IT IS WORTH
SOCIETY HAS NO RIGHT TO PUNISH ANY MAN IN REVENGE--NO RIGHT TO PUNISH ANY MAN EXCEPT FOR TWO OBJECTS--ONE THE PREVENTION OF CRIME
AND IT IS ALL THE MORE WONDERFUL WHEN WE REMEMBER THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS THE THIRD PERSON IN THE TRINITY AND CHRIST THE SECOND AND THAT THIS HOLY GHOST WAS IN FACT GOD AND THAT CHRIST ALSO WAS IN FACT GOD SO THAT GOD LED GOD INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL
SO COUNT ING THE SEEDS IN AN APPLE CANNOT IN ANY WAY DETERMINE WHETHER THE FUTURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL IS TO BE HAPPY OR MISERABLE
WE ALL KNOW THE THEOLOGICAL COUNTENANCE,--COLD UNSYMPATHETIC CRUEL LIGHTED WITH A PIOUS SMIRK,--NO LINE OF LAUGHTER--NO DIMPLED MIRTH--NO TOUCH OF HUMOR--NOTHING HUMAN
WITHIN TWO YEARS BETWEEN 1598 AND 1600 IN ONE DISTRICT OF FRANCE THE DISTRICT OF JURA MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WERE TRIED AND CONVICTED BEFORE ONE JUDGE OF HAVING CHANGED THEMSELVES INTO WOLVES AND ALL WERE PUT TO DEATH
TELL THEM IT IS ALL GUESS--AND MAY BE AND PERHAPS
HOW LONG IS IT AGO SINCE THIS CAME UNTO HIM AND HE ANSWERED
DID IT DO THIS BY TORTURING HERETICS--BY EXTINGUISHING THEIR EYES--BY FLAYING THEM ALIVE
THE IDEA WAS INCULCATED THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RELATION BETWEEN THE SIN AND THE SACRIFICE,--THE GREATER THE SIN THE GREATER THE SACRIFICE
IN THE TIME OF JAMES THE FIRST A MAN WAS BURNED IN SCOTLAND FOR HAVING PRODUCED A STORM AT SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF DROWNING ONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY
THERE NEVER WAS ANYTHING MORE IDIOTIC THAN THAT
THAT IS TO SAY A CONSCIENCE
HE WAS NOT TAUGHT TO BE HONEST
THEY ORIGINATED CHEMISTRY--DISCOVERED SULPHURIC AND NITRIC ACID AND ALCOHOL
NO WONDER THAT THE BELIEF IN ETERNAL PUNISHMENT MADE THIS LOVING SOUL INSANE
MUST WE BELIEVE THAT HEROD MURDERED THE BABES OF BETHLEHEM
GOD HIMSELF TO BE SACRIFICED
WHAT DOES HE EAT
THAT HE DID NOT CAST DEVILS OUT OF FOLKS--THAT HE DID NOT CURE BLINDNESS WITH SPITTLE AND CLAY NOR TURN WATER INTO WINE NOR MAKE FISHES AND LOAVES OF BREAD OUT OF NOTHING--THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO CATCH FISHES WITH MONEY IN THEIR MOUTHS--THAT HE DID NOT TAKE A WALK ON THE WATER--THAT HE DID NOT AT WILL BECOME INVISIBLE--THAT HE DID NOT PASS THROUGH CLOSED DOORS--THAT HE DID NOT RAISE THE DEAD--THAT ANGELS NEVER ROLLED STONES FROM A SEPULCHRE--THAT CHRIST DID NOT RISE FROM THE DEAD AND DID NOT ASCEND TO HEAVEN
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF ANYTHING MORE UTTERLY ABSURD
CAN IT BE DESTROYED--ANNIHILATED
THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER EXCUSE NO OTHER BUSINESS FOR AN ARMY OR A NAVY IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
ARE THESE DEVILS IMMORTAL OR DO THEY MULTIPLY AND DIE
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING THERE WAS NO COMMERCE
TO BELIEVE IN SIGNS AND WONDERS IN AMULETS CHARMS AND MIRACLES IN GODS AND DEVILS IN HEAVENS AND HELLS MAKES THE BRAIN AN INSANE WARD THE WORLD A MADHOUSE TAKES ALL CERTAINTY FROM THE MIND MAKES EXPERIENCE A SNARE DESTROYS THE KINSHIP OF EFFECT AND CAUSE--THE UNITY OF NATURE--AND MAKES MAN A TREMBLING SERF AND SLAVE
KEEP THE DEVILS OUT OF CHILDREN--IX
THAT IS THE REASON IT IS CALLED A REVELATION
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME WHEN MEN AND WOMEN BY REASON OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF CONSEQUENCES OF THE MORALITY BORN OF INTELLIGENCE WILL REFUSE TO PERPETUATE DISEASE AND PAIN WILL REFUSE TO FILL THE WORLD WITH FAILURES
THEY DID NOT ENSLAVE--THEY BROKE THE CHAINS AND MADE MEN FREE
THE THEOLOGIAN SAYS THAT SERPENTS WERE GIVEN FANGS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THEIR ENEMIES
UNDER EVERY PIECE OF BARK LIFE LYING IN WAIT FOR LIFE
THEY ARE BOWING THEMSELVES BENEATH HODS OF UNTEMPERED MORTAR
WE DO NOT STAND WITH OUR BACKS TO THE SUN AND MISTAKE OUR SHADOW FOR GOD
IN GOVERNMENT HE FOUND THE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY IN THE WILL OF THE SUPERNATURAL
HE HAS ALLOWED HIS ENEMIES TO IMPRISON TO TORTURE AND TO KILL HIS FRIENDS
AND YET IN SPITE OF ALL I HEARD--OF ALL I READ I COULD NOT QUITE BELIEVE
A MAN SLANDERS HIS NEIGHBOR AND THEN KILLS AN OX
THEY SAY NO MASTERS LIKE THE OLD NO GOVERNMENTS LIKE THE ANCIENT NO ORATORS NO POETS NO STATESMEN LIKE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DUST FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS
WHOSE FAULT WAS IT THEN THAT THEY WERE HEATHEN
IT IS NOW ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A DOLLAR TO-DAY WILL PURCHASE MORE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE MORE FOOD CLOTHING AND FUEL THAN IT WOULD IN 1860
WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF CHRISTIANITY IN SWITZERLAND IN HOLLAND IN SCOTLAND IN ENGLAND IN AMERICA
THIS IS ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE
THE GREAT THING IS TO MAKE PEOPLE INTELLIGENT ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH NOT TO KEEP AWAY FROM TEMPTATION BUT TO RESIST IT
THE DEVIL IN THIS CASE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY EVERY-DAY DEVIL
THERE WERE ALSO TRIALS BY WATER AND BY FIRE
SAY WHAT YOU WILL OF PARTIES SAY WHAT YOU WILL OF DISHONESTY THE HOLIEST FLAG THAT EVER KISSED THE AIR IS OURS
GERMANY IS TRAVELING TOWARD THE NIGHT
THE THEOLOGIAN SAYS THAT WHAT WE CALL EVIL IS FOR OUR BENEFIT--THAT WE ARE PLACED IN THIS WORLD OF SIN AND SORROW TO DEVELOP CHARACTER
THIS MUST HAVE REQUIRED MANY MILLIONS OF YEARS
HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD FAIL KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE KILLED
THEY CANNOT FIX DEMAND
ALL MANKIND WERE UNDER THE CURSE OF THE LAW
THINK OF THE FAMILIES DESTROYED OF THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS CAST IN PRISON TORTURED AND BURNED OF THE FIRESIDES DARKENED OF THE CHILDREN MURDERED OF THE OLD THE POOR AND HELPLESS THAT WERE STRETCHED ON RACKS MANGLED AND FLAYED
FOR THE DEVIL IS COME DOWN UNTO YOU HAVING GREAT WRATH BECAUSE HE KNOWETH THAT HE HATH BUT A SHORT TIME FROM THIS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE DEVIL ONCE LIVED IN HEAVEN RAISED A REBELLION WAS DEFEATED AND CAST OUT AND THE INSPIRED WRITER CONGRATULATES THE ANGELS THAT THEY ARE RID OF HIM AND COMMISERATES US THAT WE HAVE HIM
IT IS A PROTEST AGAINST PLEASURE--A WARNING AND A THREAT
SPEECH MUST BE FREE
THE NEXT SUBJECT TO WHICH I CALL YOUR ATTENTION IS THE WONDERFUL PROGRESS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS
THE FACT IS THAT CHRISTIANITY WAS IN EXISTENCE FOR FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THERE WAS AN ASTRONOMER IN CHRISTENDOM
AND PREVAILED NOT
THERE ARE SOME OF HIS SAYINGS WHICH SHOW HIM TO HAVE BEEN A DEVOUT JEW OTHERS THAT HE WISHED TO DESTROY JUDAISM OTHERS SHOWING THAT HE HELD ALL PEOPLE EXCEPT THE JEWS IN CONTEMPT AND THAT HE WISHED TO SAVE NO OTHERS OTHERS SHOWING THAT HE WISHED TO CONVERT THE WORLD STILL OTHERS SHOWING THAT HE WAS FORGIVING SELF-DENYING AND LOVING OTHERS THAT HE WAS REVENGEFUL AND MALICIOUS OTHERS THAT HE WAS AN ASCETIC HOLDING ALL HUMAN TIES IN UTTER CONTEMPT
I ADMIT THAT THEY HONESTLY BELIEVED IN DEVILS--THAT THEY WERE CREDULOUS AND SUPERSTITIOUS
THERE IS ONLY ONE GOOD AND THAT IS HUMAN HAPPINESS
DOES HE WALK OR DOES HE FLY OR HAS HE INVENTED SOME MACHINE
WE ARE NOT TOLD IN WHAT LANGUAGE THEY CONVERSED OR HOW THEY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER AS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD MET
ALL RIGHT I ACCEPT YOUR OFFER A MURDER HAS BEEN COMMITTED SOMEBODY MUST BE HUNG AND YOUR DEATH WILL SATISFY THE LAW BUT THAT IS NOT THE LAW
THE FLOWER OF PITY NEVER BLOSSOMED IN THEIR HEARTS AND IN THEIR BRAIN
OTHER NATIONS GREW GREAT WHILE SPAIN GREW SMALL
FOR MANY CENTURIES PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY SEEN THE MALICIOUS PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT AND SO THOROUGH WAS THIS BELIEF--SO VIVID--THAT THEY MADE PICTURES OF THEM
ONLY A LITTLE WHILE AGO I READ OF A CASE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN A PENITENTIARY AND CAME OUT
WE KNOW THAT HAPPINESS FOR THE MOST PART DEPENDS ON CONDUCT
BUT THESE ARE QUESTIONS PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY THE DEVIL
THE DEAR PREACHERS MUST GIVE UP THE ACCOUNT OF CREATION--THE GARDEN OF EDEN THE MUD-MAN THE RIB-WOMAN AND THE WALKING TALKING SNAKE
IN EVERY ORTHODOX PULPIT STANDS THIS MAN OF STRAW--STANDS BESIDE THE PREACHER--STANDS WITH A CLUB CALLED A CREED IN HIS UPRAISED HAND
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF WITCHES
NATURE BECOMES A PUPPET OF THE UNSEEN POWERS
ACCORDING TO THE THEOLOGIANS GOD DID NOT MAKE ALL MEN ALIKE
THEY MADE POISON HARMLESS THEY PROTECTED THE CREDULOUS AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS DEFENDED AND RESCUED THE TRUE BELIEVER
MAN MUST HUSBAND HIS RESOURCES
I WORK WITH ALL MY STRENGTH
I SEE THE MULTITUDES WITH OPEN MOUTHS RECEIVE AS TRUTHS THE MYTHS AND FABLES OF THE VANISHED YEARS
WERE BEAK AND CLAW TOOTH AND FANG INVENTED AND PRODUCED BY INFINITE MERCY
WHENEVER ANY MAN ADVOCATES JUSTICE AND ROBBERY AS THE MEANS I SUSPECT HIM
AND YET THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE MATTER IS THEY DESPISED LIBERTY
AND IF PARENTS WANT HONEST CHILDREN THEY SHOULD BE HONEST THEMSELVES
WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM
LET HIM MAKE HIS CONGREGATION CONVERSANT WITH THE PHILOSOPHIES OF THE WORLD WITH THE GREAT THINKERS THE GREAT POETS THE GREAT ARTISTS THE GREAT ACTORS THE GREAT ORATORS THE GREAT INVENTORS THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY THE SOLDIERS OF PROGRESS
THE FIRST THING A MAN WANTS TO KNOW AND BE SURE OF IS WHEN HE HAS GOT ENOUGH
THEY HATE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE RIVALS
IT TAUGHT THAT A NUN IS PURER NOBLER THAN A MOTHER
LET ME NOW CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO ONE OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE CAUSES OF THE ABOLITION OF WHITE SLAVERY IN EUROPE
WHO KNOWS THAT THEY ARE SACRED
ANDRE KEMPE PUBLISHED A WORK IN 1569 ON THE LANGUAGE OF PARADISE IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THAT GOD SPOKE TO ADAM IN SWEDISH
IT WAS SUPPORTED BY MISTAKES EXAGGERATIONS AND LIES
CHILDREN HAVE WANTS AND PASSIONS BEFORE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF REASONING
ALL DUTIES ALL OBLIGATIONS ALL KNOWLEDGE ALL EXPERIENCE ARE FOR THIS LIFE FOR THIS WORLD
IN A LITTLE WHILE UNABLE TO GAIN A LIVING BY HONEST MEANS THEY RESORT TO CRIME THEY AGAIN APPEAR IN COURT AND AGAIN ARE TAKEN WITHIN THE DUNGEON WALLS
THEY WILL TEACH THEM TO BELIEVE IN THE DEVIL
ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT MAN MUST PROTECT HIMSELF--THAT THERE IS NO POWER SUPERIOR TO NATURE THAT CARES FOR MAN--THAT NATURE HAS NEITHER PITY NOR HATRED--THAT HER FORCES ACT WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD FOR MAN--THAT SHE PRODUCES WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT REGRET
EDUCATION REAL EDUCATION IS THE FRIEND OF HONESTY OF MORALITY OF TEMPERANCE
MY DEAR PREACHERS I BEG YOU TO TELL THE TRUTH
THAT IT CARRIED US BACK TO THE DARKEST AGES OF THE WORLD THAT IT LED US TO THE VERY BRINK OF DESTRUCTION FORCED US TO THE SHATTERED GATES OF ETERNAL RUIN DEATH AND ANNIHILATION
GO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL WOULD DESIRE TO ENTER THE BODIES OF SWINE AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO HAVE THE CONSENT OF CHRIST BEFORE THEY COULD ENTER THE SWINE
ONE ARM IS RAISED
IT IS YOUR BUSINESS TO SEE THAT YOU NEVER BECOME A BURDEN ON OTHERS
FOR THIS ACT OF DAVID CAUSED BY THE DEVIL GOD DID NOT SMITE THE DEVIL DID NOT PUNISH DAVID BUT HE KILLED 70,000 POOR INNOCENT JEWS WHO HAD DONE NOTHING BUT STAND UP AND BE COUNTED
EVERYWHERE WASTE AND ECONOMY CARE AND NEGLIGENCE
NO MAN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OWN ANY LAND THAT HE DOES NOT USE
IN ALL THAT IS IN MOUNTAIN RANGE AND BILLOWED PLAIN IN WINDING STREAM AND DESERT SAND IN CLOUD AND STAR IN SNOW AND RAIN IN CALM AND STORM IN NIGHT AND DAY IN WOODS AND VALES IN ALL THE COLORS OF DIVIDED LIGHT IN ALL THERE IS OF GROWTH AND LIFE DECAY AND DEATH IN ALL THAT FLIES AND FLOATS AND SWIMS IN ALL THAT MOVES IN ALL THE FORMS AND QUALITIES OF THINGS MAN FOUND THE SEEDS AND SYMBOLS OF HIS THOUGHTS
TO UTTER THEIR REAL THOUGHTS AND TO GIVE THEIR ACTUAL OPINIONS
DID THE WRITER OF THE ACCOUNT TRY TO CONVEY TO THE READER THE THOUGHT THAT CHRIST WAS TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL
THE OBJECT OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE TO DEVELOP THE BRAIN TO QUICKEN THE SENSES
NOW WE KNOW THAT CHARMS MAGIC AMULETS AND INCANTATIONS ARE JUST AS USELESS IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AS THEY WOULD BE IN SOLVING A PROBLEM IN MATHEMATICS
SHALL WE THANK NATURE
HE WHO THREATENS THE INVESTIGATOR WITH PUNISHMENT HERE OR HEREAFTER IS AN ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THAT NATIONS WHO PROFESSED TO BE CHRISTIAN OR EVEN IN ANY DEGREE CIVILIZED SHOULD HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS INFAMOUS TRAFFIC
HE CANNOT CHANGE
ON EVERY HAND THEY LOOK FOR FACTS AND IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT THEY GIVE TO THE WORLD THE FACTS THEY FIND
NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE EGOTISM AND IMPUDENCE OF THE MAN WHO CLAIMS THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHT AND DENIES THE SAME RIGHT TO OTHERS
WHO WROTE THE BOOK
THEY WORSHIPED OSIRIS ISIS AND HORUS THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST WERE KNOWN
THE UNITED STATES WAS THEN THE GREATEST SLAVE-HOLDING POWER IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD
NO LONGER CHEER THE SUFFERING
HE MUST BE PROTECTED FROM HEAT AND COLD FROM SNOW AND STORM
THEY DID NOT KNOW MUCH BUT THEY BELIEVED A GREAT DEAL
SPENCER GAVE HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION AND SUSTAINED IT BY COUNTLESS FACTS
IN THIS THEY ARE NOT HONEST
MAN MUST PROTECT HIMSELF
THIS WAS COL
NEARLY ALL WERE WORSHIPED BY WISE MEN ALL OF THEM FASTED FOR FORTY DAYS--ALL OF THEM TAUGHT IN PARABLES--ALL OF THEM WROUGHT MIRACLES--ALL MET WITH A VIOLENT DEATH AND ALL ROSE FROM THE DEAD
THE SCHOOLS THAT COULD BE BUILT THE WANTS THAT COULD BE SUPPLIED
RELIGION IS HELPLESS
LOOK AT THE CHILDREN OF THE RICH
HE KNOWS THAT CHRIST HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT WAS NOT ONLY TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL BUT WAS CARRIED BY HIS SATANIC HIGHNESS TO THE TOP OF THE TEMPLE
HORACE GREELEY AS THE STORY GOES ONE COLD DAY WENT INTO A COUNTRY STORE TOOK A SEAT BY THE STOVE UNBUTTONED HIS COAT AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS
TRUTH IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS REASON SHOULD BE HIS GUIDE AND MASTER
STANDING HERE AT THE CLOSE OF THE 19TH CENTURY--AMID THE TROPHIES OF THOUGHT--THE TRIUMPHS OF GENIUS--HERE UNDER THE FLAG OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC--KNOWING SOMETHING OF THE HISTORY OF MAN--HERE ON THIS DAY THAT HAS BEEN SET APART FOR THANKSGIVING I MOST REVERENTLY THANK THE GOOD MEN THE GOOD WOMEN OF THE PAST I THANK THE KIND FATHERS THE LOVING MOTHERS OF THE SAVAGE DAYS
IN A FEW YEARS THE CHRISTIANS WILL BECOME--LET US HOPE--HUMANE AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO DENY THE DOGMA THAT FILLS THE ENDLESS YEARS WITH PAIN
YOU WILL FIND AN ACCOUNT OF THIS IN THE BIBLE
SO PERFECTLY DID HE COUNTERFEIT THE FEATURES AND FORM OF THE BISHOP THAT MANY WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE PRELATE WERE ACTUALLY DECEIVED AND THE WIDOW HERSELF THOUGHT HER LOVER WAS THE BISHOP
GOD HATES LAUGHTER AND DESPISES MIRTH
I REMEMBER THE SUNSHINE AND RAIN
THE FACT THAT JEHOVAH HAD ORDERED THE JEWS TO KEEP THE SABBATH GIVING AS A REASON THAT HE HAD MADE THE WORLD IN SIX DAYS AND RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DID NOT INTERFERE WITH THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE EPOCH THEORY
IN MY YOUTH I READ RELIGIOUS BOOKS--BOOKS ABOUT GOD ABOUT THE ATONEMENT--ABOUT SALVATION BY FAITH AND ABOUT THE OTHER WORLDS
THINK THAT AFTER THE FATHER BEGOT THE SON THE FATHER WAS STILL ALONE AND AFTER THE HOLY GHOST PROCEEDED FROM THE FATHER AND THE SON THE FATHER WAS STILL ALONE--BECAUSE THERE NEVER WAS AND NEVER WILL BE BUT ONE GOD
MODIFICATIONS OF JEHOVAH--CHANGING THE BIBLE--IX
I THANK LINCOLN FOR THE PROCLAMATION
AS A RULE THE MAN CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF AND AS A RULE THE WOMAN NEEDS HELP
THEY HAVE BUILT THE TEMPLES
KNEW THAT GOD'S PATIENCE WAS NEARLY EXHAUSTED
BY THESE MEANS MAN WILL OVERCOME MANY OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS OF NATURE
HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW THEIR NAMES
AND THEN I READ THE AGE OF REASON BY THOMAS PAINE
THEIR POOR BODIES WERE CARRIED AWAY BY THEIR FRIENDS
THAT ECLIPSES WERE NOT CAUSED BY THE WRATH OF GOD--THAT COMETS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF EMPIRES OR THE DEATH OF KINGS THAT THE STARS WHEELED IN THEIR ORBITS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ACTIONS OF MEN
HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HE WAS AND IS
THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL IN THIS
III
III
III
III
III
III
GENERALLY THE ROADS WERE SO BAD THAT THE WAGONS WERE LAID UP WITH THE BOATS
THAT HE SHOULD MAKE HELL A NECESSITY AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS CREATION COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN WOULD SUFFER ETERNAL PAIN
WITH MOST OF THESE PERIODS THEY ASSOCIATE CERTAIN FORMS OF LIFE SO THAT IT IS KNOWN THAT THE LOWEST FORMS OF LIFE BELONGED WITH THE EARLIEST PERIODS AND THE HIGHER WITH THE MORE RECENT
SHOULD THE INFERIOR MAN THANK GOD
THAT IS TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE PHYSICAL IMPERFECTIONS
A SACRIFICE HAD TO BE MADE FOR THE SINS OF THE PEOPLE
THESE HOMES SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY EXEMPT
I READ KEATS WHOSE NAME WAS WRIT IN WATER"--READ ST AGNES EVE A STORY TOLD WITH SUCH AN ARTLESS ART THAT THIS POOR COMMON WORLD IS CHANGED TO FAIRY LAND--THE GRECIAN URN THAT FILLS THE SOUL WITH EVER EAGER LOVE WITH ALL THE RAPTURE OF IMAGINED SONG--THE NIGHTINGALE--A MELODY IN WHICH THERE IS THE MEMORY OF MORN--A MELODY THAT DIES AWAY IN DUSK AND TEARS PAINING THE SENSES WITH ITS PERFECTNESS
THEY SAY THAT KING ARTHUR WAS NOT BORN LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS BUT WAS FORMED BY A MAGICAL CONTRIVANCE MADE BY A WIZARD
THAT THIS BABE THIS CHILD OF POVERTY AND WANT GREW TO MANHOOD WITHOUT EDUCATION KNOWING NOTHING OF ART OR SCIENCE AND AT ABOUT THE AGE OF THIRTY BEGAN WANDERING ABOUT THE HILLS AND HAMLETS OF HIS NATIVE LAND DISCUSSING WITH PRIESTS TALKING WITH THE POOR AND SORROWFUL WRITING NOTHING BUT LEAVING HIS WORDS IN THE MEMORY OR FORGETFULNESS OF THOSE TO WHOM HE SPOKE
OUR FORCE OUR THOUGHT WE DO NOT SPEND IN VAIN ATTACKS
THIS IS THE FIRST SCHOOL
HE MUST TAKE THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW
THAT THE DEAD ARE TO BE RAISED
THE AGE OF REASON FILLED WITH HATRED THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO LOVED THEIR ENEMIES AND THE OCCUPANT OF EVERY ORTHODOX PULPIT BECAME AND STILL IS A PASSIONATE MALIGNER OF THOMAS PAINE
THEY OUGHT TO KNOW THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF FORCE EXISTING WITHOUT AND BEFORE MATTER--THAT IT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF MATTER WITHOUT FORCE--THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF THE CREATION OR DESTRUCTION OF MATTER OR FORCE,--THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF INFINITE INTELLIGENCE DWELLING FROM ETERNITY IN INFINITE SPACE AND THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF THE CREATOR OR CREATION OF SUBSTANCE
WHAT IS THE TESTIMONY OF ONE WHO WAS ASLEEP WORTH
TO THEM THE WORLD WAS UNKNOWN
AFTERWARD THE FOLLOWERS OF MOHAMMED BECAME THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE AND HATED FACTS AS INTENSELY AND HONESTLY AS CHRISTIANS
THEY HAVE CARRIED AWAY OUR LORD
HE FOUND AND MATHEMATICALLY EXPRESSED THE RELATION OF DISTANCE MASS AND MOTION
THEY HUMBLED THEMSELVES CONFESSED THEIR SINS AND FILLED THE HEAVENS WITH THEIR VOWS AND CRIES
LET ME TELL YOU THE LAST VERSE
THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE TARTARS ORIGINALLY CAME FROM HELL AND THAT THEY WERE CALLED TARTARS BECAUSE TARTARUS WAS ONE OF THE NAMES OF PERDITION
IT CLAIMS TO HAVE PREACHED PEACE BECAUSE ITS FOUNDER SAID I CAME NOT TO BRING PEACE BUT A SWORD IT CLAIMS TO HAVE PRESERVED THE FAMILY BECAUSE ITS FOUNDER OFFERED A HUNDRED-FOLD HERE AND LIFE EVERLASTING TO THOSE WHO WOULD DESERT WIFE AND CHILDREN
THEY WERE THE SHEPHERDS AND THE PEOPLE WERE THEIR SHEEP AND IT WAS THEIR BUSINESS TO GUARD THE FLOCK FROM THE WOLVES OF THOUGHT AND DOUBT
IT IS WELL TO KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT INDEBTED TO THE CHURCH TO CHRISTIANITY FOR ANY USEFUL FACT
THIS STATE OF THINGS LASTED UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO
IS IT NOT WONDERFUL THAT THE ENEMIES OF HEROD DID NOT CHARGE HIM WITH THIS HORROR
THINK OF THE NIAGARA OF BLOOD POURING OVER THE PRECIPICE OF CRUELTY
AND YET THE DISTANCE HAS BEEN TRAVELED BY THE HUMAN RACE
THE RICH KNOW NOTHING OF THE POOR EXCEPT THE SQUALOR AND RAGS AND WRETCHEDNESS AND WHAT THEY READ IN THE POLICE RECORDS AND THEY SAY THANK GOD WE ARE NOT LIKE THOSE PEOPLE THEIR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH SCORN AND CONTEMPT AND THE HEARTS OF THE OTHERS WITH ENVY AND HATRED
ONLY THOSE WHO ARE BLIND TO FACTS CAN SEE THESE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES AND ONLY THOSE WHO REACH CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF EVIDENCE CAN BELIEVE IN THEIR EXISTENCE
ON EVERY HAND CRUELTY AND WORSHIP PERSECUTION AND PRAYER
IF DEVILS DO NOT EXIST CHRIST WAS EITHER HONESTLY MISTAKEN INSANE OR AN IMPOSTOR
HE SOMETIMES ASSUMED THE APPEARANCE OF A PRIEST AND COMMITTED CRIMES
FROM THE INTERPOLATIONS LEGENDS ACCRETIONS MISTAKES AND FALSEHOODS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT IS IT POSSIBLE TO FREE THE ACTUAL MAN
ABOVE HER WE CANNOT RISE BELOW HER WE CANNOT FALL
WHAT ECSTASY IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT GOD EXISTS
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT NATURE IS GOING TO MURDER US ALL
THERE WERE WHITE SLAVES IN SCOTLAND UNTIL THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY
HIS BUSINESS IS TO STAND BY THAT REVELATION AND TO DEFEND THAT CREED
THEY ARE SHUNNED SUSPECTED AND DESPISED
THAT RECORDS SHOULD BE KEPT
CENTURIES OF DARKNESS--THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT--WHEN MEN BEGAN TO THINK--X
THEY FOUND HOW TO WARM THEMSELVES--TO FIGHT THE FROST AND STORM
IT FOUNDED SCHOOLS WHERE FACTS WERE DENIED WHERE SCIENCE WAS DENOUNCED AND PHILOSOPHY DESPISED
ON THE OTHER GOD READY TO LAUNCH THE INFINITE CURSE
AND WHY SHOULD WE INVESTIGATE AND REASON
LET US BE HONEST
LET US BE HONEST
THEY HAVE NOT BUILT THEM FOR CHARITY--BUT IN SELF-DEFENCE
THE GREAT DRAMA IN WHICH ALL MUST ACT--IGNORANT AND LEARNED IDIOTIC AND INSANE--WITHOUT REHEARSAL AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE OF A PART OR OF ANY PLOT OR PURPOSE IN THE PLAY
OF COURSE THIS IS ABSURD
THEY THOUGHT THAT THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS OF THIS LIFE WAS TO SAVE YOUR SOUL--THAT ALL SHOULD RESIST AND SCORN THE PLEASURES OF SENSE AND KEEP THEIR EYES STEADILY FIXED ON THE GOLDEN GATE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM
HE ALSO TAUGHT THE SAVAGERY THAT WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE WAS NO REMISSION OF SIN
IF HE WAS TEMPTED WHO TEMPTED HIM
HOW DID YOUR DEVIL WHO WAS AT ONE TIME AN ANGEL OF LIGHT COME TO SIN
THESE SPIRITS WERE OF VARIOUS KINDS
HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE ANGEL GABRIEL CONTENDED WITH THE DEVIL FOR THE BODY OF MOSES
THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS BELIEF IN ETERNAL PAIN HAS BEEN THE REAL PERSECUTOR
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING NEARER A FAIRER DIVISION IN THIS WORLD
YET WE ARE TOLD THAT IT IS OUR DUTY TO LOVE THIS GOD
NO MAN WHO DOES RIGHT PRACTICES SELF-DENIAL
MILLIONS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS WITH HOPES AND LOVES AND ASPIRATIONS LIKE OURSELVES HAVE BEEN SACRIFICED UPON THE ALTAR OF BIGOTRY
THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS TO TRY TO TRAMPLE OUT HIS MANHOOD BY PUTTING AN INDIGNITY UPON HIM
WHY SHOULD HE DEMAND OUR PRAISE
FOR MANY CENTURIES IT WAS BELIEVED THAT ECLIPSES OF THE SUN AND MOON WERE PROPHETIC OF PESTILENCE OR FAMINE AND THAT COMETS FORETOLD THE DEATH OF KINGS OR THE DESTRUCTION OF NATIONS THE COMING OF WAR OR PLAGUE
BUT SOME WITHOUT STATING THEIR OWN POSITION SAID THAT OTHERS BELIEVED NOT IN THE EXISTENCE OF A PERSONAL DEVIL BUT IN THE PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL AND THAT ALL REFERENCES TO THE DEVIL IN THE SCRIPTURES COULD BE EXPLAINED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DEVIL THUS ALLUDED TO WAS SIMPLY A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CRIME TO TEACH A SLAVE
DID THEY DO THAT WITHOUT CHRIST'S CONSENT AND IS IT A FACT THAT CHRIST PROTECTS SWINE AND NEGLECTS HUMAN BEINGS
JEHOVAH TOLD HIM THAT THIS HE SHOULD DO ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE
THESE TEMPLES THESE PALACES THESE CITIES THE RUINS OF WHICH YOU STAND UPON WERE BUILT BY TYRANNY AND INJUSTICE
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY CREEP INTO THE BODIES OF MEN AND SWINE
FROM HIS DOMINIONS SHOULD BE BANISHED THE HOSTS OF FORCE AND FEAR
AND THEN MY HEART WAS FILLED WITH GRATITUDE WITH THANKFULNESS AND WENT OUT IN LOVE TO ALL THE HEROES THE THINKERS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THE LIBERTY OF HAND AND BRAIN--FOR THE FREEDOM OF LABOR AND THOUGHT--TO THOSE WHO FELL ON THE FIERCE FIELDS OF WAR TO THOSE WHO DIED IN DUNGEONS BOUND WITH CHAINS--TO THOSE WHO PROUDLY MOUNTED SCAFFOLD'S STAIRS--TO THOSE WHOSE BONES WERE CRUSHED WHOSE FLESH WAS SCARRED AND TORN--TO THOSE BY FIRE CONSUMED--TO ALL THE WISE THE GOOD THE BRAVE OF EVERY LAND WHOSE THOUGHTS AND DEEDS HAVE GIVEN FREEDOM TO THE SONS OF MEN
THEY FOUGHT HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND THE THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD BEATEN HIM GAVE TO THEIR DYING LIPS THE SMILE OF VICTORY
SUPERSTITION CANNOT READ A LINE OR SPELL THE SHORTEST WORD
AND HE WHO TRIES TO BRIBE THE INVESTIGATOR WITH THE PROMISE OF ETERNAL JOY IS A TRAITOR TO HIS FELLOW-MEN
I THANK THE SCIENTISTS ONE AND ALL
IN THE WIDE NIGHT OUR STAR CAN SHINE AND SHED ITS RADIANCE ON THE GRAVES OF THOSE WE LOVE
IF THAT BE TRUE CAN IT BE SAID THAT HE WAS DIVINE
BUT IN THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER I FIND THIS
HE DEFENDED HIMSELF AND SUCCEEDED IN CUTTING OFF ONE OF THE WOLF'S PAWS WHEREUPON THE WOLF RAN AND THE MAN PICKED UP THE PAW AND PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET WENT HOME
THEY SHOULD BE THE HERALDS OF THE EVER COMING DAY BUT THEY ARE THE BATS THE OWLS THAT INHABIT RUINS THAT HATE THE LIGHT
I AM NOT A COMMUNIST
OUR CHURCHES FOR THE MOST PART ARE CLOSED DURING THE WEEK BEING USED ONLY A PART OF ONE DAY IN SEVEN
WHAT MOTIVE COULD THEN HAVE INDUCED SO MANY TO CONFESS
THEY KNEW TOO ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE TO PURIFY AND ELEVATE THE RACE
HE HAS LIVED ALONE IN THE DESERT
IN THE SAME CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD THAT A MAN IN THE SYNAGOGUE HAD A SPIRIT OF AN UNCLEAN DEVIL THIS DEVIL RECOGNIZED JESUS AND ADMITTED THAT HE WAS THE HOLY ONE OF GOD
IF TIMES GOT HARD THE POOR LITTLE SHOEMAKERS MADE A LIVING MENDING HALF-SOLING STRAIGHTENING UP THE HEELS
HE SHOULD PRESERVE AS HIS MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL THE PERFECT VERACITY OF HIS SOUL
THIS BELIEF WAS ALMOST UNIVERSAL AND EVEN IN OUR TIME THE SACRED BONES ARE BELIEVED IN BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
SHE GAVE HER GOLD TO SUPERSTITION HER BRAIN TO PRIESTS BUT SHE FAITHFULLY COUNTED HER BEADS
THESE GOOD SPIRITS PROTECTED THE FAITHFUL FROM THE TEMPTATIONS AND SNARES OF THE EVIL ONE
THEY SHOULD DENY THE FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
IN ONLY ONE WAY COULD THE GUILTY BE JUSTIFIED AND THAT WAS BY THE DEATH THE SACRIFICE OF THE INNOCENT
DOES THE WORD GOD STAND FOR WHAT WE KNOW OR FOR WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW
I USED TO GO TO THE BLACKSMITH SHOP AT NIGHT GET UP ON THE FORGE AND HEAR THEM TALK ABOUT TURNING HORSE-SHOES
BY INVESTIGATION EXPERIMENT AND REASON
THIS PAYS THE SCULPTOR FOR CHISELING THE SHAPELESS ROCK INTO FORMS OF BEAUTY ALMOST DIVINE AND THE POET FOR SINGING THE HOPES THE LOVES AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE WORLD
ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS FULLY SUSTAINED BY PUBLIC OPINION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED EVEN THOUGH HE HAD PROCURED THE BURNING OF THE NOBLE CASTALIO AT THE STAKE
CERTAINLY WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO CHANGE OR AVOID THEIR MEANING OR TO DISHONESTLY CORRECT THEIR MISTAKES
OUR ANCESTORS DID NOT REGARD THESE RELICS AS MEDICINE HAVING A CURATIVE POWER BUT THE IDEA WAS THAT EVIL SPIRITS STOOD IN DREAD OF HOLY THINGS--THAT THEY FLED FROM THE BONE OF A SAINT THAT THEY FEARED A PIECE OF THE TRUE CROSS AND THAT WHEN HOLY WATER WAS SPRINKLED ON A MAN THEY IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE PREMISES
ALL THE POPES AND CARDINALS BISHOPS AND PRIESTS BELIEVED IN DEVILS
A DIFFERENCE AS TO THE MODE OF BAPTISM
TO DO RIGHT IS THE BUD AND BLOSSOM AND FRUIT OF WISDOM
TRUTH IS THE MOTHER OF JOY
THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES SIT IN MOSES SEAT ALL THEREFORE WHATSOEVER THEY BID YOU OBSERVE THAT OBSERVE AND DO AND IT IS EASIER FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PASS THAN ONE TITTLE OF THE LAW TO FAIL CHRIST WENT INTO THE TEMPLE AND CAST OUT THEM THAT SOLD AND BOUGHT THERE AND SAID
IT IS BRUTAL LOW AND CONTEMPTIBLE
IT WAS ALSO KNOWN THAT SORCERERS AND WITCHES HAD MARKS ON THEIR BODIES THAT HAD BEEN IMPRINTED BY THE DEVIL
WAR AND THEOLOGY WERE THE BUSINESS OF MANKIND
MANY CHAPTERS APPEAR TO BE INCOMPLETE AND PARTS OF DIFFERENT BOOKS ARE WRITTEN IN THE SAME WORDS SHOWING THAT BOTH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ORIGINAL
THE MEN OR WOMEN WHO ASK FOR EVIDENCE--WHO DESIRE TO KNOW THE TRUTH--CARE NOTHING FOR SIGNS
THEY WERE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW JERUSALEM WITH ITS GOLDEN STREETS AND GATES OF PEARL
WITH ALL MY HEART I THANK THEM ALL
THEY KNEW THAT IT TOOK HIM SIX DAYS TO MAKE THE EARTH--ALL PLANTS ALL ANIMALS ALL LIFE AND ALL THE GLOBES THAT WHEEL IN SPACE
MY OWN OBSERVATION HAS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT MEN ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT IN THEIR THEORIES AND INCONSISTENT IN THEIR LIVES
NOW WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY ANOTHER CLASS
BOYCOTTING IS NO REMEDY
SO I WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO CAST HER OFF UNLESS SHE HAD FLAGRANTLY VIOLATED THE CONTRACT
IT GAVE US FIENDS AND IMPS WITH WINGS LIKE BATS
WHY WERE THE ANGELS SO BAD
ORMUZD WAS THE GOOD--THE GOD--AHRIMAN THE EVIL--THE DEVIL AND BETWEEN THE GOD AND THE DEVIL WAS WAGED A PERPETUAL WAR
THINK OF WHAT THE WORLD HAS SUFFERED FROM FEAR
7TH 1522
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE MADE AS AGREEABLE AS POSSIBLE
DOES THE OLD TESTAMENT TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
BUT WITH THE INVENTION OF PRINTING IDEAS BEGAN TO CIRCULATE BORN OF THE BUSY BRAIN OF THE MILLION--LITTLE RIVULETS OF FACTS RUNNING INTO RIVERS OF INFORMATION AND THEY ALL FLOWING INTO THE GREAT OCEAN OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
BUT HE FAILED
IN A FEW YEARS YOU WILL TAKE THE BIBLE FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH
YOU PUNISH HIM
IF THE DEVIL DOES NOT EXIST THE CHRISTIAN CREEDS ALL CRUMBLE AND THE SUPERSTRUCTURE KNOWN AS CHRISTIANITY BUILT BY THE FATHERS BY POPES BY PRIESTS AND THEOLOGIANS--BUILT WITH MISTAKES AND FALSEHOODS WITH MIRACLES AND WONDERS WITH BLOOD AND FLAME WITH LIES AND LEGENDS BORROWED FROM THE SAVAGE WORLD BECOMES A SHAPELESS RUIN
HE SHOULD REASON
TOILERS ARE PAID WITH THE LASH,--BABES ARE SOLD,--THE INNOCENT STAND ON SCAFFOLDS AND THE HEROIC PERISH IN FLAMES
THE REV
AND YET TO-DAY THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS ENDEAVORING TO BUILD THE TEMPLES AND CITIES AND TO ADMINISTER OUR GOVERNMENT UPON THE OLD PLAN
SOCIAL DISCIPLINE WAS WRETCHED
TELL THE TRUTH DEVELOP YOUR BRAINS USE ALL YOUR SENSES AND HOLD HIGH THE TORCH OF REASON
THIS IS ONLY ONE INSTANCE
TO WEAVE CLOTH TO CURE OR PREVENT DISEASE
I REMEMBER JUST HOW THE SHOPS USED TO LOOK
THE ROADS WERE ALWAYS HORRIBLE AND BESIDES ALL THIS EVERY COUNTRY WAS AT WAR WITH NEARLY EVERY OTHER
IF THIS BE SO THE SOULS IN HELL SHOULD GROW TO GREATNESS WHILE THOSE IN HEAVEN SHOULD SHRINK AND SHRIVEL
A GOD COULD NOT MAKE A LAW FOR MAN THEN SUFFER IN THE PLACE OF THE MAN WHO HAD VIOLATED IT AND SAY THAT THE LAW HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND THE PENALTY DULY ENFORCED
ENORMOUS AS THE COST HAS BEEN THE PRINCIPLE IS WORTH A THOUSAND TIMES AS MUCH
HE TRIED TO SHOW THAT CHILDREN COULD JUSTLY BE PUNISHED FOR THE SINS OF THEIR ANCESTORS AND THAT MEN COULD IF THEY HAD FAITH BE JUSTLY CREDITED WITH THE VIRTUES OF OTHERS
THERE IS NO AUTHORITY IN CHURCHES OR PRIESTS--NO AUTHORITY IN NUMBERS OR MAJORITIES
AFTER A TIME THE HEBREW IDEA FALLING INTO DISREPUTE OTHER LANGUAGES CLAIMED THE HONOR OF BEING THE ORIGINAL ONES
IN A FEW MINUTES A LITTLE BOY WHO CLERKED IN THE STORE SAID
THEY KISSED THE RELICS FELL AT SHRINES BESOUGHT THE VIRGIN AND THE SAINTS BUT THE PRAYERS ALL DIED IN THE HEARTLESS AIR AND THE PLAGUE SWEPT ON TO ITS NATURAL END
DID CHRIST OR ANY OF HIS APOSTLES ADD TO THE SUM OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE
HE CANNOT THINK WITHOUT THE EXPENDITURE OF FORCE
THAT IS THE RESULT OF MENTAL SLAVERY
THEY COULD ALMOST HEAR THE HARPS AND HALLELUJAHS
CHRISTIANITY CLAIMS WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT IT ESTABLISHED ASYLUMS FOR THE INSANE
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SUCH A CONGREGATION IN A FEW YEARS WOULD BECOME THE MOST INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES
BUT WHAT WAS ONE VOICE AGAINST THE TERRIBLE CRY OF IGNORANT MILLIONS?--A DROWNING MAN IN THE WILD ROAR OF THE INFINITE SEA
THINK OF THE DAYS WHEN SUPERSTITION AND FEAR WERE IN EVERY HOUSE IN EVERY MIND WHEN ACCUSATION WAS CONVICTION WHEN ASSERTION OF INNOCENCE WAS REGARDED AS A CONFESSION OF GUILT AND WHEN CHRISTENDOM WAS INSANE
THEY DENOUNCED LYELL THE GREAT GEOLOGIST FOR GIVING FACTS TO THE WORLD
IF FORCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CREATED
IN SPITE OF THIS GOD ALLOWED THE PEOPLE TO LIVE AND MULTIPLY FOR SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AND THEN ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR WICKEDNESS DROWNED THEM ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EIGHT PERSONS
THAT THE SACRAMENTAL BREAD AND WINE ARE CHANGED INTO THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF GOD AND THE TRINITY
THAT HER HOUSE WAS HER CASTLE AND THAT IN ITS POSSESSION SHE COULD NOT BE DISTURBED EVEN BY THE NATION
WE ARE TOLD IN ACTS OF THE APOSTLES THAT PETER STOOD UP IN THE MIDST OF THE DISCIPLES AND SAID
MATTER AND FORCE ETERNAL--LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF EVOLUTION--VIII
TO FORCE ALL MINDS TO A COMMON FORM AND UTTERLY DESTROY THE INDIVIDUALITY OF MAN
THEY HAVE TOLD US SOMETHING OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY WIND AND WAVE BY FIRE AND FROST BY LIFE AND DEATH THE CEASELESS WORKERS THE PAUSELESS FORCES OF THE WORLD
THE BARBARIC WORLD WAS TO BE REWARDED IN SOME OTHER WORLD FOR ACTING SENSIBLY IN THIS
WHAT A GLORIOUS WHAT AN EQUITABLE TRANSACTION
THAT CHRIST IS COMING AGAIN
HE TAKES THE LEFT HAND BELIEVING IT TO BE THE RIGHT ROAD AND TRAVELS UNTIL HE FINDS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ONE
BUT HE MOCKS WHEN THEIR FEAR COMETH AND AT THEIR CALAMITY HE FILLS THE HEAVENS WITH LAUGHTER
WITH PRIESTS AND PRAYERS THEY TRIED TO STAY THE PLAGUE
IF HE HAS TO HURRY UP A LITTLE TO GET TO IT GOOD
THERE IS NO REAL INVESTIGATION WITHOUT FREEDOM--FREEDOM FROM THE FEAR OF GODS AND MEN
ENVIRONMENT IS A SCULPTOR--A PAINTER
HE KNOWS THAT THE PRIEST BELIEVED AS FIRMLY AS THE PEASANT
AND THE DEAR PREACHERS WILL BE COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT THERE NEVER WAS A MIRACULOUS BABE WITHOUT A NATURAL FATHER THAT CHRIST IF HE LIVED WAS A MAN AND NOTHING MORE
THEY WERE POLITE ENOUGH TO SIT IN THEIR OPEN GRAVES AND WAIT FOR CHRIST TO RISE FIRST
IT IS CLAIMED NOT ONLY THAT CHRIST WAS THE SON OF GOD BUT THAT HE WAS AND IS GOD
MATTHEW AND LUKE GIVE THE GENEALOGY AND BOTH SHOW THAT CHRIST WAS THE SON OF JOSEPH
NO HONEST MAN SHOULD EVER TURN ROUND TO JOIN ANYTHING
LIFE PURSUING LIFE AND IN ITS TURN PURSUED BY DEATH PRESSES TO THE SNOW LINE OF THE POSSIBLE AND EVERY FORM OF LIFE OF INSTINCT THOUGHT AND ACTION IS FIXED AND DETERMINED BY CONDITIONS BY COUNTLESS ANTECEDENT AND CO-EXISTING FACTS
WE KNOW THAT MILLIONS ARE SEEKING THE IMPOSSIBLE--TRYING TO SECURE THE AID OF THE SUPERNATURAL--TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF LIFE--TO GUESS THE RIDDLE OF DESTINY AND TO PLUCK FROM THE FUTURE ITS SECRET
KNOWS THAT EVERY STEP HE TAKES LEADS TO THE INFINITE CATASTROPHE
HER PROSPECTS IN LIFE LESSENED
THE SAME WITH THE BLACKSMITH
KEPLER ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN OF THE WORLD AND AN ASTRONOMER SECOND TO NONE ALTHOUGH HE PLUCKED FROM THE STARS THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE WAS AN ASTROLOGER AND THOUGHT HE COULD PREDICT THE CAREER OF ANY MAN BY FINDING WHAT STAR WAS IN THE ASCENDANT AT HIS BIRTH
WE BANISH THE PHANTOMS THE MISTAKES AND LIES AND CLING TO THE TRUTH
FROM WHAT COUNTRY DID THEY COME
THE PANORAMA PASSES BEFORE ME
THE SAME IS TRUE OF LEVITICUS AND NUMBERS
NO MAN SHOULD GO AN INCH WITH A PARTY--NO MATTER IF THAT PARTY IS HALF THE WORLD AND HAS IN IT THE GREATEST INTELLECTS OF THE EARTH--UNLESS THAT PARTY IS GOING HIS WAY
ANYTHING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE WAS NOT WORTH TELLING
DID INFINITE GOODNESS CREATE THE BEASTS OF PREY WITH THE INTENTION THAT THEY SHOULD DEVOUR THE WEAK AND HELPLESS
THIS IS THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE
THEY HAVE PREACHED AND TAUGHT AND IN COUNTLESS WAYS HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAKE PEOPLE HONEST TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND VIRTUOUS
THE JEWS CULTIVATED THE SCIENCE OF DEMONOLOGY AND AT ONE TIME IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE NINE KINDS OF DEMONS
LET HIM BE TRUE TO THE HUMAN RACE INSTEAD OF TO HIS LITTLE BUSINESS--BE TRUE TO THE IDEAL IN HIS HEART AND BRAIN INSTEAD OF TO HIS LITTLE PRESENT AND APPARENT SELFISHNESS--LET HIM HAVE A LARGER AND MORE INTELLIGENT SELFISHNESS--A GENEROUS PHILOSOPHY THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY OTHERS BUT HIMSELF
THEY WANT NOTHING PAINTED OR SCULPTURED BUT HANDS FACES AND CLOTHES
IN EVERY DIRECTION THIS TIRELESS MAN FOUGHT THE ABSURD THE MIRACULOUS THE SUPERNATURAL THE IDIOTIC THE UNJUST
SO IT IS SAID IN THE THIRD CHAPTER THAT UNCLEAN SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM AND CRIED SAYING THOU ART THE SON OF GOD IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER IS AN ACCOUNT OF CASTING OUT THE DEVILS THAT WENT INTO THE SWINE AND WE ARE TOLD THAT ALL THE DEVILS BESOUGHT HIM SAYING SEND US INTO THE SWINE AND JESUS GAVE THEM LEAVE AGAIN I ASK
DURING THESE CENTURIES WHAT HAVE THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE GOOD OF MAN
WHAT DOES GOD DO?--THE INFINITE JUGGLER AND HIS PUPPETS--WHAT THE PUPPETS HAVE DONE--SHALL WE THANK THESE GODS?--SHALL WE THANK NATURE?--III
THE DEATHS WERE ONE IN 23 EACH YEAR
BENEATH THE CROWN HE SAW THE CRIMINAL UNDER THE MITER THE HYPOCRITE
THAT THEY FOLLOW THE FALLEN THE ERRING THE OUTCASTS THE FRIENDLESS AND WIN THEM BACK TO VIRTUE LOVE AND JOY
WAS THE WATER TROUBLED BY AN ANGEL
IT WAS DECLARED THAT GOD WOULD PROVIDE FOR YOUR WIDOW AND YOUR FATHERLESS CHILDREN
THE CHILD SHOULD BE EQUIPPED FOR THE BATTLE OF LIFE
FORWARD OH SUBLIME ARMY OF PROGRESS FORWARD UNTIL LAW IS JUSTICE FORWARD UNTIL IGNORANCE IS UNKNOWN FORWARD WHILE THERE IS A SPIRITUAL OR TEMPORAL THRONE FORWARD UNTIL SUPERSTITION IS A FORGOTTEN DREAM FORWARD UNTIL THE WORLD IS FREE FORWARD UNTIL HUMAN REASON CLOTHED IN THE PURPLE OF AUTHORITY IS KING OF KINGS
AND THAT THE APPEARANCE WAS PRODUCED BY THE REFLECTION AND REFRACTION OF LIGHT
I FOUND THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY BORROWED OUR CHRIST--BUT THAT ALL OUR SACRAMENTS SYMBOLS AND CEREMONIES WERE LEGACIES THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE BURIED PAST
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PLACES CALLED HEAVEN AND HELL EXIST
SOME THINK THAT MEN CAN BE SAVED BY FAITH WITHOUT WORKS AND SOME THINK THAT FAITH AND WORKS ARE BOTH ESSENTIAL BUT ALL AGREE THAT WITHOUT FAITH THERE IS NO SALVATION
BESIDES THE CEREMONY SAYS TO ALL THE WORLD THAT THOSE WHO MARRY ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
AND THE POOR PUPPETS WHO ARE LEFT ALIVE FALL ON THEIR KNEES AND THANK THE JUGGLER WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS
THE BIOLOGISTS THROUGH THE FOSSIL FORMS OF LIFE ESTABLISHED THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN AND DEMONSTRATED THE WORTHLESSNESS OF HOLY WRIT
WE HAD YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS AND I SUPPOSED THAT THE AUTHOR WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY DEVOUT AND LOVING FOLLOWER OF THE LORD
THERE WERE NO GOLD OR SILVER MINES IN PALESTINE
THE WALLS OF MY PRISON CRUMBLED AND FELL THE DUNGEON WAS FLOODED WITH LIGHT AND ALL THE BOLTS AND BARS AND MANACLES BECAME DUST
ALL WHO BELIEVE THESE THINGS WILL BE SAVED AND THEY WHO DOUBT OR DENY WILL BE LOST
THAT THE GARDEN OF EDEN WAS THE PERSONIFICATION OF A PLACE AND THAT THE WHOLE STORY IS A PERSONIFICATION OF SOMETHING THAT DID NOT HAPPEN
EACH NATION DECIDES FOR ITSELF AND EACH NATION ENDEAVORS TO CARRY ITS DECISION INTO EFFECT
WHITE SLAVERY ESTABLISHED BY KIDNAPPING AND PIRACY SUSTAINED BY TORTURE AND INFINITE CRUELTY WAS DEFENDED TO THE VERY LAST
THEY WANT NO EXPLANATION
NOW THERE IS AT JERUSALEM BY THE SHEEP MARKET A POOL WHICH IS CALLED IN THE HEBREW TONGUE BETHESDA HAVING FIVE PORCHES
THAT ALL THE MIRACLES DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE WERE PERFORMED
MY DOG HE SAID JUST BARKS AND PLAYS--HAS ALL HE WANTS TO EAT
FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND
WE ARE MOULDED AND FASHIONED BY OUR SURROUNDINGS
THEY WERE UNBALANCED EMOTIONAL HYSTERICAL BIGOTED HATEFUL LOVING AND INSANE
LET EVERY MAN TEACH HIS SON TEACH HIS DAUGHTER THAT LABOR IS HONORABLE
THE LABOR QUESTION
THAT THEY ARE NOT CHANGED
BALDUR WAS A SUN-GOD
THE WORLD MUST THINK
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF HUMAN NATURE IN THOSE DAYS
HE TAUGHT IGNORANCE NOTHING BUT OBEDIENCE AND FOR OBEDIENCE HE OFFERED ETERNAL JOY
THINK OF THE EGOTISM OF A MAN WHO BELIEVES THAT AN INFINITE BEING WANTS HIS PRAISE
BUT WITH CIVILIZATION THE WANTS OF THE BODY INCREASE THE INTELLECTUAL HORIZON WIDENS AND THE BRAIN DEMANDS MORE AND MORE
HAS IT MADE MEN NOBLER MORE MERCIFUL NEARER HONEST
THEY TELL ABOUT DIVES AND LAZARUS PAINT RICH MEN IN HELL AND BEGGARS IN HEAVEN
MARY WROTE NOTHING SAID NOTHING
SOME HAD ONCE BEEN MEN OR WOMEN SOME HAD NEVER LIVED IN THIS WORLD AND SOME HAD BEEN ANGELS FROM THE COMMENCEMENT
LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION WHY SHOULD GOD DEMAND PRAISE
THEY HAVE FED AND CLOTHED THEIR PRIESTS--BUT THE GODS HAVE GIVEN NOTHING IN RETURN
SCALPING WAS KNOWN AND PRACTICED LONG BEFORE BARRET DISCOVERED THE HAIR REGENERATOR
I CITE THIS INSTANCE NOT MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CASTING ODIUM UPON CALVIN BUT TO SHOW YOU WHAT PUBLIC OPINION WAS AT THAT TIME WHEN SUCH THINGS WERE ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS
HE WAS INTENSELY HUMAN
DEAD--A LONG WAY FROM THE TRUMPET TO THE TELEPHONE THE TELEPHONE THAT TRANSPORTS SPEECH AS SWIFT AS THOUGHT AND DROPS THE WORDS PERFECT AS MINTED COINS IN LISTENING EARS--A LONG WAY FROM A FALLEN TREE TO THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE--FROM THE DRIED SINEWS OF BEASTS TO THE CABLES OF STEEL--FROM THE OAR TO THE PROPELLER--FROM THE SLING TO THE RIFLE--FROM THE CATAPULT TO THE CANNON--A LONG DISTANCE FROM REVENGE TO LAW--FROM THE CLUB TO THE LEGISLATURE--FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM--FROM APPEARANCE TO FACT--FROM FEAR TO REASON
I THANK BRUNO THE BRAVEST AND SPINOZA THE SUBTLEST OF MEN
IT IS CLAIMED BY CHRISTIAN HISTORIANS THAT THE RELIGION OF A NATION WAS SOMETIMES SUDDENLY CHANGED AND THAT MILLIONS OF PAGANS WERE MADE INTO CHRISTIANS BY THE COMMAND OF A KING
THE ONLY WAY WAS TO PRAY AND FAST
THAT THE SPIRIT AND THE DEVIL WERE ACTING TOGETHER IN A KIND OF PIOUS CONSPIRACY
TAKE THE DEVIL FROM THE DRAMA OF CHRISTIANITY AND THE PLOT IS GONE
SHE IS THE ONE TRUE DISCIPLE
SHALL WE THANK THE CHURCH
TAKE FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT THE INFINITE SAVAGERY THE SHORELESS MALEVOLENCE OF ETERNAL PAIN THE ABSURDITY OF SALVATION BY FAITH THE IGNORANT BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE OF DEVILS THE IMMORALITY AND CRUELTY OF THE ATONEMENT THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE THAT DENIES TO VIRTUE THE RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENCE AND HOW GLORIOUS IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT THE REMAINDER IS TRUE
REAL EDUCATION IS THE HOPE OF THE FUTURE
THEY BECAME SENSIBLE AND SECULAR WORLDLY AND WISE
PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL
SPAIN CLUNG TO HER CREED
I HAVE ENDEAVORED THUS FAR TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY ENSLAVING THE HUMAN MIND
SOME WOULD TELL OF UNBELIEVERS WHO HAD LIVED AND DIED IN PEACE
IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE WRITERS WERE DIVINELY INSPIRED AND THAT ALL THEY WROTE IS TRUE
OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A BEING THERE CAN BE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS NO EVIDENCE
I WAS FREE
CHRIST SAID TO A MAN
HE HAD ALSO DISCOVERED THAT GOD WAS ONLY SIX FEET HIGH AND THE SUN FOUR MILES OFF
HYPOCRISY WILL COLLECT NO TOLLS FROM FEAR LIES WILL NOT BE REGARDED AS SACRED THIS LIFE WILL NOT BE SACRIFICED FOR ANOTHER HUMAN BEINGS WILL LOVE EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF GODS MEN WILL DO RIGHT NOT FOR THE SAKE OF REWARD IN SOME OTHER WORLD BUT FOR THE SAKE OF HAPPINESS HERE
THIS WOULD TEND TO MAKE THE BABE SERIOUS REFLECTIVE RELIGIOUS AND MISERABLE
THERE WERE NO PROHIBITED PLACES IN ALL THE REALMS OF THOUGHT--NO AIR NO SPACE WHERE FANCY COULD NOT SPREAD HER PAINTED WINGS--NO CHAINS FOR MY LIMBS--NO LASHES FOR MY BACK--NO FIRES FOR MY FLESH--NO MASTER'S FROWN OR THREAT--NO FOLLOWING ANOTHER'S STEPS--NO NEED TO BOW OR CRINGE OR CRAWL OR UTTER LYING WORDS
AND LET US TEACH THAT GREAT WEALTH IS NOT GREAT HAPPINESS
ALL THE SEEDS OF CHRISTIANITY--OF SUPERSTITION WERE SOWN IN MY MIND AND CULTIVATED WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AND CARE
IS IT NOT WONDERFUL THAT MARK LUKE AND JOHN NEVER HEARD OF THESE SAINTS
TO BUILD A SCHOOLHOUSE IS TO CONSTRUCT A FORT
FIRST THE GREAT WEAPON IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE BALLOT
IN THEIR CREED THERE WAS NO GUESS--NO PERHAPS
THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN STAND AND THE SWELLING DOME OF THE TEMPLE WILL TOUCH THE STARS
NOW THE QUESTIONS ARE WHETHER RELIGION WAS FOUNDED ON ANY KNOWN FACT
THEY ARE WORKING IN ALL OUR HOMES
IT GAVE US ANGELS WITH WINGS--CHERUBIM AND SERAPHIM AND A HEAVEN WITH HARPS AND HALLELUJAHS--WITH STREETS OF GOLD AND GATES OF PEARL
THE GUTTER IS A NURSERY
HE DID NOT CLAIM TO BE INSPIRED--DID NOT PRETEND THAT THE STORY HAD BEEN TOLD TO HIM BY JEHOVAH
YOU CANNOT CONVERT A MAN WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
IT HAS BEEN UNIVERSAL
SHAKESPEARE WHO KNEW THE BRAIN AND HEART OF MAN--THE HOPES AND FEARS THE LOVES AND HATREDS THE VICES AND THE VIRTUES OF THE HUMAN RACE
A FEW YEARS AGO REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STARS WERE FOUND ON THE WALLS OF AN OLD TEMPLE AND IT WAS DISCOVERED BY CALCULATING BACKWARD THAT THE STARS DID OCCUPY THE EXACT POSITIONS AS REPRESENTED ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS BEFORE CHRIST
FOR THEM HE CREATED THE ETERNAL PRISON WHERE HE COULD FEED FOREVER THE HUNGER OF HIS HATE
IT CANNOT BE DESTROYED
SPENT OUT OF BREATH SHAKING WITH FEAR HE REACHES HIS HUT AND FALLS AT THE DOOR
THEY HAD CONFIDENCE IN THE WORDS OF CHRIST
THE MAN OF SENSE KNOWS THE HISTORY OF THIS BELIEF AND HE KNOWS ALSO THAT FOR MANY CENTURIES ITS TRUTH WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE HOLY BIBLE
NOT ONE OF THESE MIRACLES CAN BE ESTABLISHED EXCEPT BY IMPUDENT AND IGNORANT ASSERTION--EXCEPT BY POISONING AND DEFORMING THE MINDS OF THE IGNORANT AND THE YOUNG
THAT SLAVERY IS A DIVINE INSTITUTION AND THAT ALL MEN SHOULD BE FREE
WHY DID HE ALLOW MILLIONS OF HIS CHILDREN TO BE ENSLAVED
SO IT CLAIMS TO HAVE TAUGHT THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN AND THAT THE GOSPEL IS FOR ALL THE WORLD BECAUSE CHRIST SAID TO THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA THAT HE CAME ONLY TO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND DECLARED THAT IT WAS NOT MEET TO TAKE THE BREAD OF THE CHILDREN AND CAST IT UNTO DOGS
BACK OF THE GOOD MAN PLACED A GOD
CHILDREN SOMETIMES ARE SUPERIOR TO THEIR PARENTS MODIFY THEIR IDEAS CHANGE THEIR CUSTOMS AND ARRIVE AT DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS
WE ARE FURTHER TOLD THAT WHEN THE THOUSAND YEARS ARE EXPIRED SATAN SHALL BE LOOSED OUT OF HIS PRISON AND THE DEVIL WAS CAST INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE WHERE THE BEAST AND THE FALSE PROPHET ARE AND SHALL BE TORMENTED DAY AND NIGHT FOREVER IN THE LIGHT OF THE PASSAGES THAT I HAVE READ WE CAN CLEARLY SEE WHAT THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVED
LET US BE HONEST--GENEROUS
BUT THE CHURCH CRIES
UNDER THEIR TEACHINGS MEN WASTE AND MISDIRECT THEIR ENERGIES ABANDON THE ENDS THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO THE IMPOSSIBLE WORSHIP THE UNKNOWN PRAY TO THE INCONCEIVABLE AND BECOME THE TREMBLING SLAVES OF A MONSTROUS MYTH BORN OF IGNORANCE AND FASHIONED BY THE TREMBLING HANDS OF FEAR
IN THE GLOOM OF ECLIPSES THIEVES AND ROBBERS DIVIDED THEIR BOOTY WITH GOD AND POOR HONEST IGNORANT GIRLS REMEMBERING THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO SAY A PRAYER GAVE THEIR LITTLE EARNINGS TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF GOD
HOW DO THEY PROVE THAT CHRIST ROSE FROM THE DEAD
I SEE THEM KISS THE UNCONSCIOUS LIPS AS THEIR HOT TEARS FALL ON THE PALLID FACES OF THE DEAD
I FOUND THAT JEHOVAH WAS NOT A SCULPTOR NOT A PAINTER--NOT AN ARTIST--THAT HE LACKED THE POWER THAT CHANGES CLAY TO FLESH--THE ART THE PLASTIC TOUCH THAT MOULDS THE PERFECT FORM--THE BREATH THAT GIVES IT FREE AND JOYOUS LIFE--THE GENIUS THAT CREATES THE FAULTLESS
HE HAS ENSLAVED AND LIBERATED THE SONS OF MEN
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF HUMAN NATURE IN US ALL
THE MAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER HOPES TO RISE
THE PYTHIAN APOLLO PRINCE OF LIARS
THE POOR IN TENEMENTS AND HUTS IN SPITE OF RAGS AND HUNGER HOPE FOR WEALTH.--HOPE FILLS THEIR THIN AND TREMBLING HANDS WITH GOLD
THE POOR AFRICAN THAT POURS OUT HIS HEART TO HIS DEITY OF STONE IS ON AN EXACT RELIGIOUS LEVEL WITH THE ROBED PRIEST WHO SUPPLICATES HIS GOD
THE CHURCH OPPOSED THE STUDY OF ANATOMY--WAS AGAINST THE DISSECTION OF THE DEAD
THAT THIRTEEN IS NO MORE DEADLY THAN TWELVE
I HOPE HOWEVER THAT I HAVE GRATITUDE ENOUGH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBLIGATIONS I AM UNDER TO THE GREAT AND HEROIC MINDS OF ANTIQUITY AND THAT I HAVE MANLINESS AND INDEPENDENCE ENOUGH NOT TO BELIEVE WHAT THEY SAID MERELY BECAUSE THEY SAID IT AND THAT I HAVE MORAL COURAGE ENOUGH TO ADVOCATE IDEAS HOWEVER MODERN THEY MAY BE IF I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE RIGHT
SUPERSTITION SHEDS BLOOD
LET US PRAY V
THE CHURCH WAS TRIUMPHANT
WHILE HE HATED JEHOVAH HE PRAISED THE GOD OF NATURE THE CREATOR AND PRESERVER OF ALL
YET EDWARDS SAID THAT HE LOVED GOD
HE IS AFRAID TO LOOK BACK
THEY FRIGHTEN THE HAPPY WITH THREATS OF PAIN--THEY SOOTHE THE WRETCHED WITH GILDED LIES
THERE IS SOMETHING IN MONEY THAT DRIES UP THE SOURCES OF AFFECTION AND THE PROBABILITY IS IT IS THIS
THE SCIENTIST ARRIVES AT THE UNTHINKABLE THE INCONCEIVABLE AND CALLS IT THE UNKNOWN
MAKE RESTITUTION REPARATION UNDO THE WRONG AND YOU NEED SHED NO BLOOD
A FACT INCONSISTENT WITH THE CREED IS DENOUNCED AS A LIE AND THE MAN WHO DECLARES OR ANNOUNCES THE FACT IS A BLASPHEMER
BESIDES THE NAMES OF ALL THE ANCESTORS ARE DIFFERENT WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS
WHY WAS GOD SO UNPOPULAR
FOUR HE MARRIES
HE CORRUPTED THE HUMAN RACE
THINK OF THE HEARTS HARDENED OF THE HEARTS BROKEN OF THE CRUELTIES INFLICTED OF THE AGONIES ENDURED OF THE LIVES DARKENED
IN THOSE TIMES YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT FAILING TO CONVERT A MAN OR WOMAN BY THE ORDINARY MEANS THEY RESORTED TO EVERY ENGINE OF TORTURE THAT THE INGENUITY OF BIGOTRY COULD DEVISE
AND THERE CAME A VOICE FROM HEAVEN SAYING
CAN BOTH ACCOUNTS BE TRUE
THE JEWS HAD NO COMMERCE
IT IS SAID THAT IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ROGER BACON A FRANCISCAN MONK INVENTED GUNPOWDER BUT THIS INVENTION WAS WITHOUT A FELLOW
THEY STUFF THEIR MINDS WITH MISTAKES AND THINK THEY ARE WISE
IT IS THE SEED AND SOIL THE HEAT AND RAIN OF LOVE AND JOY
AFTER I HAD LEARNED A LITTLE ABOUT THE STARS I CONCLUDED THAT THIS WRITER THIS INSPIRED SCRIBE HAD BEEN MISLED BY MYTH AND LEGEND AND THAT HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT CREATION THAN THE AVERAGE THEOLOGIAN OF MY DAY
IT IS ASSERTED THAT AN INFINITE GOD CREATED ALL THINGS GOVERNS ALL THINGS AND THAT THE CREATURE SHOULD BE OBEDIENT AND THANKFUL TO THE CREATOR
IF A MAN COULD MAKE A PERFECT CIRCLE THE DIAMETER OF WHICH WAS EXACTLY ONE-HALF THE CIRCUMFERENCE THAT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IN GEOMETRY
HIS GOLD WAS WORTHLESS THEN
WE KNOW THE PAST--THE PATHS THAT MAN HAS TRAVELED--HIS MISTAKES HIS TRIUMPHS
THEY ROASTED THEM UPON SLOW FIRES
WHERE ONE MAN DIES AND SOME OF HIS ATOMS PASS INTO THE BODY OF ANOTHER MAN AND HE DIES TO WHOM WILL THESE ATOMS BELONG IN THE DAY OF RESURRECTION
IN FIRST PETER WE ARE TOLD TO BE SOBER VIGILANT BECAUSE YOUR ADVERSARY THE DEVIL AS A ROARING LION WALKETH ABOUT SEEKING WHOM HE MAY DEVOUR ARE PEOPLE DEVOURED BY PERSONIFICATIONS OR MYTHS
WILL SOME CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR HAVE THE GOODNESS TO HARMONIZE THESE INSPIRED ACCOUNTS
THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS
THIS BELIEF DID NOT REST ON ANY FACT
BUT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT THE SPIRIT DRIVING CHRIST INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL
THERE IS ANOTHER POINT
THEY WERE BEGGARS--PARASITES--VERMIN
THE VANDERBILTS COULD BUY TO-DAY ALL THE LAND THAT IS IN FARMS IN THE STATE OF OHIO--EVERY FOOT OF IT
JOHN DOES NOT SAY THAT THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THE WATER WAS TROUBLED BY AN ANGEL BUT HE STATES IT AS A FACT
I KNOW THAT THEY DECIDED THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS NOT CREATED--NOT BEGOTTEN--BUT THAT HE PROCEEDED
THEY WERE NOT QUITE LOGICAL
GOOD DEEDS BEAR FRUIT AND IN THE FRUIT ARE SEEDS THAT IN THEIR TURN BEAR FRUIT AND SEEDS
BACK OF LIFE OF EXISTENCE WE CANNOT GO--BEYOND DEATH WE CANNOT SEE
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR MAN TO FORGIVE GOD
IF ALL WHO HAVE BEEN MARRIED WERE JOINED TOGETHER BY THE SUPERNATURAL WE MUST ADMIT THAT THE SUPERNATURAL IS NOT INFINITELY WISE
I DO NOT FORGET HEALTH AND HARVEST HOME AND LOVE--BUT WHAT OF PESTILENCE AND FAMINE
THIS EXCHANGE OF IDEAS THIS COMPARISON OF THOUGHT HAS GIVEN TO EACH GENERATION THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE PAST
BEYOND THE HORIZON OF THE NATURAL MAN CANNOT GO
FOR TEN YEARS HE WAS KEPT IN PRISON--FOR TEN YEARS UNTIL RELEASED BY THE PITY OF DEATH
WE KNOW THAT HE WROTE AT LEAST FIVE ARTICLES
THE PASSION OF THE SAVAGE IS UNINFLUENCED BY HIS THOUGHT WHILE THE THOUGHT OF THE PHILOSOPHER IS UNINFLUENCED BY PASSION
THEY MISTOOK THE BONES OF THE MASTODON FOR THOSE OF HUMAN BEINGS AND BY THEM PROUDLY PROVED THAT THERE WERE GIANTS IN THOSE DAYS THEY ACCOUNTED FOR THE FOSSILS BY SAYING THAT GOD HAD MADE THEM TO TRY OUR FAITH OR THAT THE DEVIL HAD IMITATED THE WORKS OF THE CREATOR
ALL FACTS THAT ARE AGAINST HIS RELIGION HE WILL DENY
THERE ARE IN EUROPE TO-DAY BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE MILLIONS OF SOLDIERS READY TO TAKE THE FIELD AND THE FRONTIERS OF EVERY CIVILIZED NATION ARE PROTECTED BY BREASTWORK AND FORT
IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF JOHN IS THE FOLLOWING
NOTHING GREATER HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THE HUMAN MIND
IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB-SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
THEY TOOK NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW
IT IS SAID THAT THE CLERGY DID WHAT THEY COULD TO MAKE THE PEOPLE PIOUS BUT THEY COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH MUCH
I STUDIED ASTRONOMY JUST A LITTLE--I EXAMINED MAPS OF THE HEAVENS--LEARNED THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE CONSTELLATIONS--OF SOME OF THE STARS--FOUND SOMETHING OF THEIR SIZE AND THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH THEY WHEELED IN THEIR ORBITS--OBTAINED A FAINT CONCEPTION OF ASTRONOMICAL SPACES--FOUND THAT SOME OF THE KNOWN STARS WERE SO FAR AWAY IN THE DEPTHS OF SPACE THAT THEIR LIGHT TRAVELING AT THE RATE OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES A SECOND REQUIRED MANY YEARS TO REACH THIS LITTLE WORLD--FOUND THAT COMPARED WITH THE GREAT STARS OUR EARTH WAS BUT A GRAIN OF SAND--AN ATOM--FOUND THAT THE OLD BELIEF THAT ALL THE HOSTS OF HEAVEN HAD BEEN CREATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAN WAS INFINITELY ABSURD
THREE HE COURTS
IT IS THE DEADLIEST FOE OF THE HUMAN RACE
THINK OF THE VICTIMS
AND THEN WHAT WORRY
INGERSOLL
THEY FILLED THEIR LIVES WITH FASTINGS--WITH PRAYERS--WITH SELF-ACCUSINGS
EVERY GENTLEMAN AND LADY SHOULD USE HIS OR HER INFLUENCE TO DO AWAY WITH THIS VILE AND INFAMOUS PRACTICE
DURING ALL THESE YEARS RELIGION CONSISTED IN THE PRAISE AND WORSHIP OF THE INVISIBLE AND INFINITE OF SOME VAST AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE POWER THAT IS TO SAY OF THE SUPERNATURAL
WHERE DID DAVID GET THIS GOLD
THAT MANY HAVE A WONDERFUL VENERATION FOR ALL THAT IS ANCIENT MERELY BECAUSE IT IS ANCIENT AND THEY SEE NO BEAUTY IN ANYTHING FROM WHICH THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BLOW THE DUST OF AGES WITH THE BREATH OF PRAISE
WE CANNOT BE UNDER OBLIGATION TO ADMIRE A PAINTING--TO BE CHARMED WITH A POEM--OR THRILLED WITH MUSIC
THAT FORTY DAYS AFTER HIS BIRTH HE WAS TAKEN BY JOSEPH AND MARY TO JERUSALEM AND THAT AFTER THEY HAD PERFORMED ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEY RETURNED TO NAZARETH
THE STATESMAN READS THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD GATHERS THE STATISTICS OF ALL NATIONS TO THE END THAT HIS COUNTRY MAY AVOID THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST
ALL OF THESE GODS HAD GODS FOR FATHERS AND THEIR MOTHERS WERE VIRGINS
WITH THIS CHRISTIANITY HAS HAD NOTHING TO DO
THEY WERE PATIENT SEARCHERS FOR THE TRUTH
ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CHURCH THE VIRTUOUS WEEP AND SUFFER THE VICIOUS LAUGH AND THRIVE THE GOOD CARRY A CROSS AND THE WICKED FLY
THE SCIENCES WERE TAUGHT
THE SOIL IS POOR
I CONCLUDED THAT ALL RELIGIONS HAD SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME ORIGIN AND THAT IN FACT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN BUT ONE RELIGION IN THE WORLD
MANY OF THE CLERGY ARE NOW ASHAMED TO SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE IN DEVILS
THIS IS THE RECORD
IT IS PRETENCE FROM BEGINNING TO END
IT HAS BEEN SO TO SPEAK THE TRUMPET BLOWN BY THE GABRIEL OF PROGRESS UNTIL FROM THE GRAVES OF IGNORANCE AND SUPERSTITION THE PEOPLE HAVE LEAPED TO GRAND AND GLORIOUS LIFE SPURNING WITH SWIFT FEET THE DUST OF AN INFAMOUS PAST
LABOR AND LEARNING INDUSTRY AND INTELLIGENCE
KINGS AND COURTIERS LADIES AND CLOWNS SOLDIERS AND ARTISTS SLAVES AND CONVICTS BELIEVED AS FIRMLY IN THE DEVIL AS THEY DID IN GOD
SALVATION IS THE REWARD FOR BELIEF
I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THERE ARE MANY OPINIONS AS TO WHAT PROGRESS REALLY IS THAT WHAT ONE CALLS PROGRESS ANOTHER DENOMINATES BARBARISM
WHAT IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CHURCH--OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL
NO REFORMATION NO CHANCE TO REFORM NOTHING TO GIVE THEM BREAD WHILE MAKING NEW FRIENDS
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE BABES I WOULD GIVE HER A DIVORCE FOR THE ASKING
BURNS HAD HIS FAULTS HIS FRAILTIES
THEY BELIEVED THAT FAITH WOULD BE REWARDED WITH ETERNAL JOY AND DOUBT PUNISHED WITH ETERNAL PAIN
LET THEM HAVE A SUNDAY SCHOOL IN WHICH THE CHILDREN SHALL BE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS OF NATURE
IN HIS NAME MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED TORTURED AND KILLED
IT IS WELL TO KNOW THAT WHEN MOHAMMEDANS WERE THE FRIENDS OF SCIENCE CHRISTIANS WERE ITS ENEMIES
WITHOUT TAKING INTEREST FOR MONEY PROGRESS IS IMPOSSIBLE
NOT ON KNOWLEDGE BUT SUPERSTITION
THE GRANDEST AMBITION THAT CAN ENTER THE SOUL IS TO KNOW THE TRUTH
IS THERE ANY BEING ANYWHERE AMONG THE STARS WHO PITIES THE SUFFERING CHILDREN OF MEN
THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS
THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS THE FATHER OF CHRIST
THEY CARE NOTHING FOR COMMENTATORS
SPAIN WAS BUSY-SAVING HER SOUL
HOME IS WHERE THE VIRTUES GROW
DOES THIS GOD EXIST
THE MAN OF STRAW WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESBYTERIAN CREED TO BE CHANGED
AND YET HONEST VICTIMS OF IGNORANCE AND FEAR
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW JOSEPH WARNED BY AN ANGEL TOOK MARY AND THE CHILD AND FLED INTO EGYPT
LET US ALONE
EACH HUMAN BEING TO BE REALLY CONVINCED MUST WITNESS THE MIRACLE FOR HIMSELF
THESE THINGS HAD BEEN GUESSED PROPHESIED ASSERTED HINTED BY MANY OTHERS BUT DARWIN WITH INFINITE PATIENCE WITH PERFECT CARE AND CANDOR FOUND THE FACTS FULFILLED THE PROPHECIES AND DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF THE GUESSES HINTS AND ASSERTIONS
NOBODY KNOWS
NOBODY KNOWS
HE CANNOT OWN IT
IT IS AN IMMENSE AN ALMOST INFINITE QUESTION AND ALL WE CAN DO IS TO GUESS
FROM THIS YOU SEE THAT HE SUGGESTED THE GREAT REFORMS OF OUR CENTURY
YOU HAVE HEARD A GREAT DEAL LATELY UPON THE LAND SUBJECT
THE THEOLOGIANS DEPEND ON ASSERTIONS
WHAT DID JEHOVAH DO ON THE SECOND DAY
AND THE COST OF SUPPORTING ARMIES AND NAVIES OF REPAIRING SHIPS OF MANUFACTURING NEW ENGINES OF DEATH PROBABLY AMOUNTS INCLUDING THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT TO AT LEAST SIX MILLION DOLLARS A DAY
HAS NEVER PRACTICED ANY SELF-DENIAL
THE WAR THAT IS NOW BEING WAGED AGAINST THE FORCES OF EVIL IS AS HOPELESS AS THE BATTLE OF THE FIREFLIES AGAINST THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT
IT IS THE ONLY LEVER CAPABLE OF RAISING MANKIND
IN THE FORTY-FIRST VERSE OF THE SAME CHAPTER IT IS SAID
THE QUESTION IS SO COMPLICATED THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE SO COUNTLESS THAT A SOLUTION BY LAW OR BY FORCE SEEMS AT LEAST IMPROBABLE
TAKE ONE INSTANCE
FOR NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS THE INFALLIBLE AGENT OF GOD HAS LIVED IN ITALY
CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO THINK TO INVESTIGATE TO RELY UPON THE LIGHT OF REASON OF OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE
WE KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT DEVILS DO NOT EXIST--THAT CHRIST NEVER CAST THEM OUT AND THAT IF HE PRETENDED TO HE WAS EITHER IGNORANT DISHONEST OR INSANE
HE DOES NOT MISTAKE HOPE FOR EVIDENCE OR DESIRE FOR DEMONSTRATION
IN EGYPT THE DEVIL WAS SET--OR AS USUALLY CALLED TYPHON--AND THE GOOD GOD WAS OSIRIS
WAS IT NECESSARY FOR THE DEVILS TO GET THE PERMISSION OF CHRIST BEFORE THEY COULD ENTER SWINE
IN THE SIXTH CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD THAT THE DISCIPLES CAST OUT MANY DEVILS AND ANOINTED WITH OIL MANY THAT WERE SICK HERE AGAIN THE DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THOSE POSSESSED BY DEVILS AND THOSE AFFLICTED BY DISEASE
THEY POLLUTE THE MINDS AND IMAGINATIONS OF CHILDREN
JESUS TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF AND THEN ADDED
THEY KNEW THAT THE PATH GRASS-GROWN AND NARROW FILLED WITH THORNS AND NETTLES INFESTED WITH VIPERS WET WITH TEARS STAINED BY BLEEDING FEET LED TO HEAVEN AND THAT THE ROAD BROAD AND SMOOTH BORDERED WITH FRUITS AND FLOWERS FILLED WITH LAUGHTER AND SONG AND ALL THE HAPPINESS OF HUMAN LOVE LED STRAIGHT TO HELL
THE BABE IS NOT WELCOME BECAUSE IT IS A BURDEN
HER GREATEST FESTIVAL WAS THE AUTO DA FE
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS GOOD HONEST ZEALOUS CHRISTIANS CONTENDED AGAINST THE DEVIL
WE ARE TOLD BY THIS INSPIRED BOOK OF THE GOLD AND SILVER COLLECTED BY KING DAVID FOR THE TEMPLE--THE TEMPLE AFTERWARD COMPLETED BY THE VIRTUOUS SOLOMON
THE POWER BEHIND HER THRONE WAS THE COWLED MONK
THERE IS NO GOD OF WRATH WHO SMITES IN HEARTLESS HATE
DID THEY TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT CHEMISTRY--HOW TO COMBINE AND SEPARATE SUBSTANCES--HOW TO SUBTRACT THE HURTFUL--HOW TO PRODUCE THE USEFUL
NOW THEOLOGIANS TALK NOT ABOUT JEHOVAH BUT ABOUT A GOD OF LOVE CALL HIM THE ETERNAL FATHER AND THE PERPETUAL FRIEND AND PROVIDENCE OF MAN
EVERYWHERE PAIN DISEASE AND DEATH--DEATH THAT DOES NOT WAIT FOR BENT FORMS AND GRAY HAIRS BUT CLUTCHES BABES AND HAPPY YOUTHS
THE FOUNDATION WAS GONE--REASON HAD ABDICATED
ALMOST EVERY LAW WAS UNJUST
IN THE LANGUAGE OF PROF CLIFFORD THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF THE HUMAN RACE SO I SAY TO ALL FATHERS AND MOTHERS KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM PRIESTS
PEOPLE IN SOME INSTANCES ABANDONED THE AGED THE SICK AND THE INFIRM TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF THE EXPECTED FLOOD SO ANXIOUS WERE THEY TO REACH SOME PLACE OF SECURITY
NO ONE KNOWS AND NO ONE PRETENDS TO KNOW WHERE HEAVEN IS
HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS THEY HAVE ANSWERED NO PRAYER--HEARD NO CRY--GIVEN NO SIGN--EXTENDED NO HAND--UTTERED NO WORD
ALL OF THESE COMFORTING AND REASONABLE THINGS WERE TAUGHT BY THE MINISTERS IN THEIR PULPITS--BY TEACHERS IN SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND BY PARENTS AT HOME
IN THESE GENEALOGIES--BOTH INSPIRED--THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DAVID AND JESUS A DIFFERENCE OF SOME FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN GENERATIONS
IF THESE FOUR CORNER-STONES ARE FACTS NATURE HAS NO MASTER
THE SINS WERE TOO GREAT TO BE WASHED OUT BY THE BLOOD OF ANIMALS OR MEN
WHILE OUR ANCESTORS FILLED THE DARKNESS WITH EVIL SPIRITS ENEMIES OF MANKIND THEY ALSO BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF GOOD SPIRITS
THOUSANDS OF PERSONS BELIEVE IN LUCKY AND UNLUCKY DAYS NUMBERS SIGNS AND JEWELS
SO THE INSPIRED WRITERS DO NOT AGREE IN REGARD TO JUDAS
FROM THE EARLIEST TIME SLAVERY HAS EXISTED IN ALL COUNTRIES AND AMONG ALL PEOPLE UNTIL RECENTLY
AND YET WITH CHEEKS GLOWING AND BURNING WITH SHAME BEFORE THE BAR OF HISTORY WE ARE FORCED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO THIS TERRIBLE CHARGE
AT LAST IT WAS SOLVED BY SOME CHAPTER IN DANIEL WHEREIN IS PREDICTED SOMEBODY WITH A GOLDEN HEAD
AND LET ME ASK TO-NIGHT
WHY DID HE FAIL TO DEFEND HIMSELF BEFORE PILATE
BECAUSE HE INDUCES THE JUDGE THE JUROR TO DECIDE NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAW TO THE FACTS THE RIGHT BUT ACCORDING TO THE BRIBE
WE KNOW THAT SUPERSTITION HAS GIVEN US DELUSIONS AND ILLUSIONS DREAMS AND VISIONS CEREMONIES AND CRUELTIES FAITH AND FANATICISM BEGGARS AND BIGOTS PERSECUTIONS AND PRAYERS THEOLOGY AND TORTURE PIETY AND POVERTY SAINTS AND SLAVES MIRACLES AND MUMMERIES DISEASE AND DEATH
THE GOOD ACCOMPLISHED DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GREAT
AND SO THERE MAY BE A PLACE CALLED HEAVEN THE HOME OF GOD WHERE ANGELS FLOAT AND FLY AND PLAY ON HARPS AND HEAR WITH JOY THE GROANS AND SHRIEKS OF THE LOST IN HELL BUT OF THIS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
BECAUSE IN THE SAME SENTENCE HE SAYS AND I DO CURES TO-DAY MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEVILS AND DISEASES
AND THEN I READ SHAKESPEARE THE PLAYS THE SONNETS THE POEMS--READ ALL
THEY SHOULD NOT MAIM AND WEAR OUT THEIR SERVANTS AND THEN DISCHARGE THEM AND ALLOW THEM TO BE SUPPORTED IN POORHOUSES
PLEASURE WAS THE CHILD OF SIN AND THE HAPPY NEEDED A CHANGE OF HEART
IN THESE PIOUS PRISONS--THESE DIVINE DUNGEONS--THESE PROTESTANT AND CATHOLIC INQUISITIONS--CHILDREN ARE TORTURED WITH THESE CRUEL LIES
ONLY A FEW YEARS BEFORE PARLIAMENT HAD RESOLVED THAT ALL PICTURES IN THE ROYAL COLLECTION WHICH CONTAINED REPRESENTATIONS OF JESUS OR THE VIRGIN MARY SHOULD BE BURNED
THE TEETH AND BEAKS THE CLAWS AND FANGS THAT TEAR AND REND FILL ME WITH HORROR
THINK OF THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS
IF THE BIBLE IS TRUE THE DEVIL EXISTS
HOW DO CHRISTIANS PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THEIR GOD
WE CANNOT LOVE THE INCONCEIVABLE BUT WE CAN LOVE WIFE AND CHILD AND FRIEND
THE SEA IS COVERED WITH STEEL CLAD SHIPS FILLED WITH MISSILES OF DEATH
OF COURSE THE REAL OLD PETRIFIED ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN WILL CLING TO THE DEVIL
IT CANNOT SURRENDER
THE TRUTH IS THAT GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS--GODS AND DEVILS--ARE BEYOND THE REALM OF EXPERIENCE
THE THEOLOGICAL CHRIST IN THE NEW TESTAMENT WE FIND THE TEACHINGS AND SAYINGS OF CHRIST
THEY THOUGHT THE EARTH WAS FLAT--A LITTLE DISHING IF ANYTHING--THAT IT WAS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD AND THAT THE STARS WERE LITTLE SPARKLES MADE TO BEAUTIFY THE NIGHT
HE SEES ALL THE AGONY THE INJUSTICE THE RAGS OF POVERTY THE WITHERED HANDS OF WANT--THE MOTHERLESS BABES--THE DEFORMED--THE MAIMED--THE LEPROUS KNOWS THE TEARS THAT FLOW--HEARS THE SOBS AND MOANS--SEES THE GLEAM OF SWORDS HEARS THE ROAR OF THE GUNS--SEES THE FIELDS REDDENED WITH BLOOD--THE WHITE FACES OF THE DEAD
CORIOLANUS SCRUPLED NOT TO MAKE SLAVES OF HIS OWN COUNTRYMEN CAPTURED IN CIVIL WAR
I SEE THEM BOWING IN THEIR FEAR AND NEED TO METEORIC STONES--IMPLORING SERPENTS BEASTS AND SACRED TREES--PRAYING TO IDOLS WROUGHT OF WOOD AND STONE
ONE SEWS ON STRAPS ANOTHER GREASES THE MACHINES CUTS OUT SOLES WAXES THREADS
HE HAS INFLUENCED THE THOUGHT OF THE WISEST
THAT HE ESTABLISHED NO CHURCH
FOR THE MOST PART WE INHERIT OUR OPINIONS
NO MAN COULD WIN MORE THAN A BARE EXISTENCE BY INDUSTRY MUCH LESS FAME AND GLORY
REFORM--THE GUTTER AS A NURSERY--CAN WE PREVENT THE UNFIT FROM FILLING THE WORLD WITH THEIR CHILDREN?--SCIENCE MUST MAKE WOMAN THE OWNER AND MISTRESS OF HERSELF--MORALITY BORN OF INTELLIGENCE--IX
AND THE EVENING AND THE MORNING WERE THE SECOND DAY THE WRITER OF THIS BELIEVED IN A SOLID FIRMAMENT--THE FLOOR OF JEHOVAH'S HOUSE
FOR HER POVERTY HER MISERY SHE IS INDEBTED TO THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH TO THE INFALLIBLE AGENTS OF GOD
SCHOOLS FOR THE MORE GENERAL DIFFUSION OF IGNORANCE--SCHOOLS TO PREVENT THOUGHT--TO SUPPRESS KNOWLEDGE
ACCORDING TO JOHN CHRIST SAID THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HEAVEN WAS TO BELIEVE ON HIM AND BE BORN AGAIN
NOW THEY SAY THAT DEVILS WERE ONLY PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL
THAT UNDER LIKE CONDITIONS THE RESULTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME
THEY HAVE DIED WANDERING HOMELESS IN DESERTS GROPING IN CAVES UNTIL THEIR BLOOD CRIED FROM THE EARTH FOR VENGEANCE
AND IN JAMES IT IS SAID THAT IF WE RESIST THE DEVIL HE WILL FLEE FROM US
THESE THINGS ARE ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE THINK THAT SOMETIMES THE WORLD BECOMES INSANE AND THAT THE EARTH IS A VAST ASYLUM WITHOUT A KEEPER
AND MANY MEN WHO HAVE MADE LARGE FORTUNES FROM THE LABOR OF THEIR FELLOWS HAVE GIVEN OF THEIR MILLIONS TO WHAT THEY REGARDED AS OBJECTS OF CHARITY OR FOR THE INTERESTS OF EDUCATION
THEY HAVE WRESTLED WITH RHAPSODY AND PROPHECY WITH VISIONS AND DREAMS WITH ILLUSIONS AND DELUSIONS WITH MYTHS AND MIRACLES WITH THE BLUNDERS OF IGNORANCE THE RAVINGS OF INSANITY AND THE ECSTASY OF HYSTERICS
THAT MAN MUST BE THE PROVIDENCE OF MAN
AND WHEN I THINK OF WHAT HAS BEEN SUFFERED--OF THE CENTURIES OF AGONY AND TEARS I ASK
I REPEAT THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT THE PEOPLE THAT CONFESSED THEMSELVES GUILTY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE SO
THE TEACHER OF UNIVERSAL FORGIVENESS CANNOT BELIEVE IN ETERNAL TORTURE
THERE WAS THERE IS NO CREATOR
HERE HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS CEASELESS DISCUSSION UPON WHAT IS CALLED THE LABOR QUESTION
IT HAS TRIED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE FROM THE MALICE OF THE DEVIL--FROM GHOSTS AND SPOOKS FROM WITCHES AND WIZARDS AND ALL THE LEERING FIENDS THAT SEEK TO POISON THE SOULS OF MEN
THAT WORD DRIVES REASON FROM HIS THRONE AND GIVES THE CROWN TO MADNESS
I WANT ALL MY FELLOW-CITIZENS TO THINK OF IT
TO WORK WAS TO BE NOBODY
IN HER WE FIND THE SEED AND SOIL OF ALL THAT IS GOOD OF ALL THAT IS EVIL
LUKE NEVER HEARD OF THE STAR AND MATTHEW KNEW NOTHING OF THE HEAVENLY HOST
I'LL PRAY AND THEN I'LL SLEEP AND THIS PRAYER IS MY TEXT
HE PULLS THE STRINGS--BAITS THE HOOKS SETS THE TRAPS AND DIGS THE PITS
THERE IS ONE STORY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THAT ILLUSTRATES MY MEANING
ALL THE GREAT PROTESTANT THEOLOGIANS FROM LUTHER TO THE ORTHODOX CLERGY OF OUR TIME HAVE BEEN THE ENEMIES OF REASON
MANY OF THE SAYINGS ATTRIBUTED TO CHRIST SHOW THAT HE WAS AN ASCETIC THAT HE CARED NOTHING FOR KINDRED NOTHING FOR FATHER AND MOTHER NOTHING FOR BROTHERS OR SISTERS AND NOTHING FOR THE PLEASURES OF LIFE
IT IS TOO SAVAGE
TRUTH IS THE FOUNDATION THE SUPERSTRUCTURE AND THE GLITTERING DOME OF PROGRESS
O THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRISTIANITY
THAT YOU MUST BE BAPTIZED BY SPRINKLING
NOW MOST OF THE MINISTERS INSIST THAT THE OLD FALSEHOODS SHALL BE TREATED WITH REVERENCE--THAT ANCIENT LIES WITH LONG WHITE BEARDS--WRINKLED AND BALD-HEADED FRAUDS--ROUND-SHOULDERED AND TOOTHLESS MIRACLES AND PALSIED MISTAKES ON CRUTCHES SHALL BE CALLED ALLEGORIES PARABLES ORIENTAL IMAGERY INSPIRED POEMS
OR THEY SHOULD BE PUT UPON SOME ISLAND SOME PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE GUARDED WHERE IT MAY BE THAT BY PROPER EFFORT THEY COULD SUPPORT THEMSELVES
MURDER WAS ALWAYS A SCIENCE--MEDICINE IS NOT ONE YET
THIS IS NOT THE RESULT OF THEIR CREEDS--IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN
MAYBE YOU ARE NOT AS BAD AS I AM BUT DO ONE THING
MAN WILL FIND THAT NATURE IS THE ONLY REVELATION AND THAT HE BY HIS OWN EFFORTS MUST LEARN TO READ THE STORIES TOLD BY STAR AND CLOUD BY ROCK AND SOIL BY SEA AND STREAM BY RAIN AND FIRE BY PLANT AND FLOWER BY LIFE IN ALL ITS CURIOUS FORMS AND ALL THE THINGS AND FORCES OF THE WORLD
HE SMILES AT THE MURDERS THE ASSASSINATIONS,--THE SEDUCTIONS THE DESERTIONS--THE ABANDONED BABES OF SHAME
HE NEVER WORKS--HAS NO TROUBLE ABOUT BUSINESS
AND ALSO TO SHOW TO YOU THAT SCARCELY ANY MAN HOWEVER GREAT CAN FREE HIMSELF OF THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS TIME
SHE WAS THE FIRST AT THE SEPULCHER
TO BE ABSOLUTELY SINCERE
IT ALL OCCURRED IN A DREAM AND POOR JOSEPH WAS ASLEEP
THE GODS DIED
THAT WORD EXTINGUISHES THE LIGHT OF LIFE AND WRAPS THE WORLD IN GLOOM
THEY DID NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE CAUSE
FOR CENTURIES THE CHURCH TAUGHT THAT THE NATURAL MAN WAS TOTALLY DEPRAVED
THEY DID NOT LABOR FOR OTHERS
THEY HAVE UNCROWNED THE PHANTOMS WRESTED THE SCEPTERS FROM THE GHOSTS AND GIVEN THIS WORLD TO THE CHILDREN OF MEN
WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT JEHOVAH THE DIVINE POTTER DID NOT MIX AND MOULD CLAY INTO THE FORMS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND THEN BREATHE THE BREATH OF LIFE INTO THESE FORMS
KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL RIVAL
NO MAN HAS IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO PAINT THE AGONIES THE HORRORS AND CRUELTIES OF WAR
FOR THE BLESSINGS WE ENJOY--FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT IS OURS WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL
ONLY IN BOOKS WRITTEN BY EZRA AFTER THE RETURN FROM BABYLON
THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEYOND THE POWERS OF MY MIND THE WISE MAN IS THOUGHTFUL AND MODEST
WE MUST DISCARD THE PASSAGES THAT BREATHE THE SPIRIT OF HATRED AND REVENGE OR ADMIT THAT HE WAS MALEVOLENT
WE THANK THE GOOD MEN AND GOOD WOMEN OF THE PAST--THE POETS DRAMATISTS AND ARTISTS--THE STATESMEN--PAINE JEFFERSON ERICSSON LINCOLN
WAS THE BODY OF MARY THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD
A MAN TO BE DISTINGUISHED HAD EITHER TO BE A SOLDIER OR A MONK
THAT CONSCIENCE DROPPED FROM THE CLOUDS
TEMPTATIONS ARE AS THICK AS THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST AND NO ONE CAN BE OUT OF THE REACH OF TEMPTATION UNLESS HE IS DEAD
IN THOSE INTELLECTUAL DAYS PEOPLE BELIEVED IN WHAT WERE CALLED THE INCUBI AND THE SUCCUBI
ALL THESE SOLDIERS WERE JEWS--ALL LIVED IN PALESTINE A POOR MISERABLE LITTLE COUNTRY ABOUT ONE-QUARTER AS LARGE AS THE STATE OF NEW YORK
HE EXPECTS TO HAVE ALL OF HIS SINS CHARGED TO THE DEVIL AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WILL BE CREDITED WITH ALL THE VIRTUES OF CHRIST
WHY DOES INJUSTICE TRIUMPH
IN SHORT EVERY HUMAN AFFLICTION WAS THE WORK OF THE MALICIOUS EMISSARIES OF THE GOD OF HELL
POVERTY IS NOT A VIRTUE--ALTHOUGH THE VIRTUOUS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN POOR
BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED WITHOUT THIS BELIEF THERE IS NO SALVATION
IF GOD GOVERNS THE WORLD WHY IS INNOCENCE NOT A PERFECT SHIELD
WE HAVE THE FAMILY TREE
I CALL IN QUESTION THE MOTIVES OF NO PERSON
I HAVE NO AMBITION TO BECOME A WINGED SERVANT A WINGED SLAVE
ON EVERY HAND WAS THE MYSTERIOUS THE SINISTER THE HURTFUL
WE TRY TO EXPLAIN AND THE EXPLANATION OF ONE FACT CONTRADICTS ANOTHER
TO LAY ASIDE SOMETHING ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM HOUSE AND HEARTH DURING THE DECEMBER OF HIS LIFE SO THAT HE CAN WARM HIS WORN AND SHRIVELED HANDS AT THE FIRE OF HOME
BY THE MEMORY OF OUR OWN NOBLE DEAD
WE KNOW THAT THEY CONVINCED MILLIONS THAT CELIBACY IS THE GREATEST OF ALL VIRTUES--THAT WOMEN ARE PERPETUAL TEMPTATIONS THE ENEMIES OF TRUE HOLINESS--THAT MONKS AND PRIESTS ARE NOBLER THAN FATHERS THAT NUNS ARE PURER THAN MOTHERS
THE GREAT HISTORIAN EUSEBIUS INGENUOUSLY REMARKS THAT IN HIS HISTORY HE OMITTED WHATEVER TENDED TO DISCREDIT THE CHURCH AND MAGNIFIED WHATEVER CONDUCED TO HER GLORY
IF HE DOES NOT HE IS BROUGHT TO BOOK
PEOPLE WERE BURNED FOR SAYING THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND FOR SAYING THAT THE SUN WAS THE CENTER OF A SYSTEM
THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO HELP MEN THEY WERE FIGHTING DEVILS--DESTROYING DEMONS
WE THROW AWAY SUPERSTITION AND WELCOME SCIENCE
THESE DEVILS GAVE WITCHES AND WIZARDS THEIR SUPERNATURAL POWERS AND TOLD THEM THE SECRETS OF THE FUTURE
THROUGH THE INVENTION OF MATCHES FIRE BECAME THE COMPANION OF MAN
THEY HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR BABES THEIR LAMBS THEIR CATTLE
MENTAL LIBERTY MEANS THE RIGHT OF ALL TO READ THIS BOOK
THE ENGLISH ARE EPISCOPALIANS BECAUSE THEIR FATHERS WERE AND THE AMERICANS ARE DIVIDED IN A HUNDRED SECTS BECAUSE THEIR FATHERS WERE
THE VERY NAME OF PHILOSOPHER BECAME A TITLE OF PROSCRIPTION AND THE SLIGHTEST OFFENCES WERE PUNISHED BY DEATH
HE HAS A REVELATION FROM GOD AND HE HAS A CREED IN EXACT ACCORDANCE WITH THAT REVELATION
THE SHROUD WOULD BECOME A ROBE OF GLORY THE FUNERAL PROCESSION A HARVEST HOME AND THE GRAVE WOULD MARK THE END OF SORROW THE BEGINNING OF ETERNAL JOY
AFTER THAT OCCURRENCE SAYS HE THE POPE'S TOE WAS SUBSTITUTED WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THIS PRACTICE
HOW WE WOULD LONG TO SEE HIS FLESHLESS SKULL
THE STANDARD OF CONDUCT BECOMES HIGHER
DURING THESE DARK AGES OF CHRISTIANITY AS I SAID BEFORE NOTHING WAS INVENTED NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED CALCULATED TO INCREASE THE WELL-BEING OF MEN
WE HAD MILTON WITH HIS CELESTIAL MILITIA--WITH HIS GREAT AND BLUNDERING GOD HIS PROUD AND CUNNING DEVIL--HIS WARS BETWEEN IMMORTALS AND ALL THE SUBLIME ABSURDITIES THAT RELIGION WROUGHT WITHIN THE BLIND MAN'S BRAIN
YOU HAVE YOUR DOUBTS ABOUT THE FLOOD AND BABEL
TO KNOW THIS WOULD CHANGE ALL SORROW INTO GLADNESS
THE BARBARIAN USES A CLUB A STONE
THIS WAS THE LITERATURE OF THE CHURCH
COUNTLESS OBSTRUCTIONS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME--NUMBERLESS ENEMIES HAVE BEEN CONQUERED--THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF VICTORIES HAVE BEEN WON FOR THE RIGHT AND MILLIONS HAVE LIVED LABORED AND DIED FOR THEIR FELLOW-MEN
IT IS FOR US TO TALK
NO PITY IN HEAVEN
HE WAS IN HIS PALACE ON HIS COSTLY COUCH THE AIR HEAVY WITH PERFUME THE ROOM FILLED WITH SERVANTS AND PHYSICIANS
HE WILL BECOME INTELLIGENT AND FREE HONEST AND SERENE
POSSIBLY JEHOVAH EMPLOYED LYING SPIRITS TO DECEIVE A KING AND ALL THE WONDERS OF THE SAVAGE WORLD MAY HAVE HAPPENED BUT THE TROUBLE IS THERE IS NO PROOF
NATIONS INSTEAD OF BUYING AND SELLING FROM AND TO EACH OTHER TOOK WHAT THEY WANTED BY BRUTE FORCE
THE THEOLOGIANS ATTACKED THOSE WHO STUDIED OTHER RELIGIONS
THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT A DEVIL SAID TO CHRIST
KNEW THAT HE WOULD DECEIVE AND CORRUPT THE CHILDREN OF MEN
WE KNOW THAT MAN CAN BY NO POSSIBILITY CREATE A FORCE
MURDERERS THOSE BELONGING TO THE DANGEROUS CLASSES THOSE WHO ARE SO FORMED BY NATURE THAT THEY RUSH TO THE CRIMES OF DESPERATION SHOULD BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE
HE EMPTIES THE VOLCANO AND THEY PERISH IN FIRE
NOTHING FOR WHAT ARE CALLED WONDERS
THE WORLD MUST LEARN THAT CREDULITY IS NOT A VIRTUE AND THAT NO QUESTION IS SETTLED UNTIL REASON IS FULLY SATISFIED
HE HAS NO PITY
HE SAYS AND TEACHES THAT CREDULITY IS SAFE AND THOUGHT DANGEROUS
IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE INSPIRED WRITERS KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF MAN
IS NOT THAT EXACTLY WHAT THE MAN OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILLIONS OR OF FIVE MILLIONS DOES TO-DAY
IN DOING THIS THEY HAVE JUSTIFIED NEARLY EVERY CRIME AND EVERY CRUELTY
I WANT THAT QUESTION THOUGHT OF
WHERE DO ANGELS LIVE
MINISTERS WHO ADMIT THAT WITCHCRAFT IS A SUPERSTITION WILL READ THE STORY OF THE WITCH OF ENDOR--WILL READ IT IN A SOLEMN REVERENTIAL VOICE--WITH A THEOLOGICAL VOICE--AND WILL HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE IT
IT WAS A SYMBOL OF LIFE OF IMMORTALITY--OF THE GOD AGNI AND IT WAS CHISELED UPON TOMBS MANY AGES BEFORE A LINE OF OUR BIBLE WAS WRITTEN
THIS FELLOW DOTH NOT CAST OUT DEVILS BUT BY BEELZEBUB THE PRINCE OF DEVILS JESUS ANSWERED BY SAYING
THAT THERE IS TO BE NO RESURRECTION
HE FEELS THAT THE SOMETHING IS APPROACHING
RIGHT HERE--HERE AMID ALL THE PALACES AMID THE THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF PROPERTY--HERE
I SPOKE UNTO THY DISCIPLES THAT THEY SHOULD CAST HIM OUT AND THEY COULD NOT SO THEY BROUGHT THIS BOY BEFORE CHRIST AND WHEN THE BOY SAW HIM THE SPIRIT TARE HIM AND HE FELL ON THE GROUND AND WALLOWED FOAMING CHRIST ASKED THE FATHER
NEITHER HAS THE HOLY GHOST THE SUPPOSED FATHER EVER SAID OR WRITTEN ONE WORD
ONE HE COMES
THEY FOUND THAT THE COAL WAS ONCE VEGETABLE MATTER
HIS GOSPEL FILLED THE WORLD WITH HATRED AND REVENGE
THEY HAD NO GREAT FACTORIES THEY PRODUCED NOTHING FOR OTHER COUNTRIES
NOW SUCH EFFORTS ARE LOCAL AND THE RESULT UP TO THIS TIME HAS BEEN FAILURE
THAT YOU MUST KEEP THE SABBATH HOLY
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN TYRANNY OF GOVERNMENT BUT I DO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
I READ ZENO THE MAN WHO SAID CENTURIES BEFORE OUR CHRIST WAS BORN THAT MAN COULD NOT OWN HIS FELLOW-MAN
ALL THAT IS IS NATURAL
BEING CONDITIONLESS HE CANNOT BE BENEFITED OR INJURED
THE DEVIL BAITED HIS TRAPS WITH PRESENT PLEASURE WITH THE GRATIFICATION OF THE SENSES WITH THE ECSTASIES OF LOVE AND LAUGHED AT THE JOYS OF HEAVEN AND THE PANGS OF HELL
BELOW THIS CHRISTIAN DOGMA SAVAGERY CANNOT GO
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT DEMONS AND SORCERERS FREQUENTLY CAME TOGETHER AND HELD WHAT WERE CALLED SABBATS THAT IS TO SAY ORGIES
THERE ARE THOUSANDS
THEY OWNED NO SHIPS
BETTER TO LIVE A FREE AND LOVING LIFE--A LIFE THAT ENDS FOREVER AT THE GRAVE--THAN TO BE AN IMMORTAL SLAVE
THE BIBLE GIVES THE AGE AT WHICH ADAM DIED AND GIVES THE GENERATIONS TO THE FLOOD--THEN TO ABRAHAM AND SO ON AND SHOWS THAT FROM THE CREATION OF ADAM TO THE BIRTH OF CHRIST IT WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND AND FOUR YEARS
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT DAVID COLLECTED NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND TONS OF GOLD--THAT HE BY ECONOMY GOT TOGETHER ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND TONS OF SILVER MAKING A TOTAL OF GOLD AND SILVER OF SIXTY-EIGHT THOUSAND TONS
I PRAY THEE SEND LAZARUS THAT HE MAY DIP THE TIP OF HIS FINGER IN WATER AND COOL MY PARCHED TONGUE FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTOOD THE DOGMA OF ETERNAL PAIN--APPRECIATED THE GLAD TIDINGS OF GREAT JOY FOR THE FIRST TIME MY IMAGINATION GRASPED THE HEIGHT AND DEPTH OF THE CHRISTIAN HORROR
WARMING WITH HIS SUBJECT HE PRESSED FORWARD AND SUDDENLY STABBED HIS OPPONENT INFLICTING A MORTAL WOUND
AND MILLIONS OF AGES HENCE THAT WAIL WILL CROSS THE GULF THAT LIES BETWEEN THE SAVED AND LOST AND STILL WILL BE HEARD THE CRY
HOW CAN WE PROVE THAT HE IS MERCIFUL THAT HE CARES FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
AND THIS STATE OF THINGS PRODUCED THE SAME EFFECT IN THE MENTAL WORLD THAT CONFINING ALL THE WATER TO THE SPRINGS WOULD IN THE PHYSICAL
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS THE PEOPLE GREW GRADUALLY WORSE
THEY ALSO KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN THWARTED BY THE DEVIL WHO WITH WILES AND LIES HAD DECEIVED THE FIRST OF HUMAN KIND
IF A MAN COULD MAKE TWICE FOUR NINE THAT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IN MATHEMATICS
IF THEY ARE THREATENING AND MALICIOUS SHE HAS HEARD A DEVIL
NONE BUT THE NOBLEST SHOULD INFLICT PUNISHMENT EVEN ON THE BASEST
HE STOOD AT A GREAT HEIGHT AND WITH THE EYES OF A PHILOSOPHER A PROFOUND THINKER SURVEYED THE WORLD
ACCORDING TO THAT HOLY BOOK JEHOVAH WAS A BELIEVER IN WITCHCRAFT AND SAID TO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE
WHEN PEOPLE BECOME REALLY INTELLIGENT WHEN THE BRAIN IS REALLY DEVELOPED NO HUMAN BEING WILL GIVE HIS LIFE TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHAT HE DOES NOT NEED OR WHAT HE CANNOT INTELLIGENTLY USE
WHO KNOWS THAT SUCH A BEING AS THE HOLY GHOST EVER EXISTED
HOW WOMEN--GOOD WOMEN--CAN LOVE THIS JEHOVAH IS BEYOND MY IMAGINATION
POSSIBLY FISHES WERE FOUND WITH MONEY IN THEIR MOUTHS
WHY DID HE DELIBERATELY SOW THE SEEDS OF DISCORD IN HEAVEN KNOWING THAT HE WOULD CAST THEM INTO THE LAKE OF ETERNAL FIRE--KNOWING THAT FOR THEM HE WOULD CREATE THE ETERNAL PRISON WHOSE DUNGEONS WOULD ECHO FOREVER THE SOBS AND SHRIEKS OF ENDLESS PAIN
ALL THE GREAT THEOLOGIANS IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAVE DENOUNCED REASON AS THE LIGHT FURNISHED BY THE ENEMY OF MANKIND--AS THE ROAD THAT LEADS TO PERDITION
LET US WAIT AND WORK
A MAN WALKING IN THE WOODS AT NIGHT--JUST A GLIMMERING OF THE MOON--EVERYTHING UNCERTAIN AND SHADOWY--SEES A MONSTROUS FORM
THEY FOUND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE CRUST OF THE EARTH
NOW WE KNOW THAT WITCHES NEVER LIVED THAT HUMAN BEINGS NEVER BARGAINED WITH ANY DEVIL AND THAT OUR PIOUS SAVAGE ANCESTORS WERE MISTAKEN
THEY PROVED THE EXISTENCE OF DEVILS BY THE NEW TESTAMENT
YET THE ASTRONOMICAL REPRESENTATIONS FOUND MUST HAVE BEEN MADE MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE WORLD WAS DROWNED
IT TAUGHT THE FALL OF MAN AND THE ATONEMENT--PROVED THAT A JEWISH PEASANT WAS GOD--ESTABLISHED THE EXISTENCE OF HELL PURGATORY AND HEAVEN
THE EVIDENCE OF THE CHURCH--THE DEVIL WAS FORCED TO FATHER THE FAILURES OF GOD--BELIEF OF THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH IN DEVILS--EXORCISM AT THE BAPTISM OF AN INFANT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY--BELIEF IN DEVILS MADE THE UNIVERSE A MADHOUSE PRESIDED OVER BY AN INSANE GOD--V
THE SCHOOLHOUSE IS THE REAL CATHEDRAL AND SCIENCE THE ONLY POSSIBLE SAVIOR OF THE HUMAN RACE
THE QUESTION NOW IS
THEY KNEW THE ORIGIN THE CAUSE OF EVIL OF ALL CRIME OF ALL DISEASE AND DEATH
AND THIS MAN INSTEAD OF MAKING CRIME A BUSINESS WOULD BECOME A GOOD HONORABLE AND USEFUL-CITIZEN
THE LORD WAS ON ABIJAH'S SIDE AND HE KILLED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF JEREBOAM'S MEN
IF GOD EXISTS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HE IS GOOD THAT HE CARES FOR US
WHAT EVIDENCE HAVE WE THAT CHRIST WAS GOD
HARVEY DISCOVERED THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD
DID THEY TEACH US THE MYSTERIES OF THE METALS AND HOW TO PURIFY THE ORES IN FURNACE FLAMES
WE CAN FLOOD OUR YEARS WITH SUNSHINE--WITH THE DIVINE CLIMATE OF KINDNESS AND WE CAN DRAIN TO THE LAST DROP THE GOLDEN CUP OF JOY
ALL THIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HORRIBLE IDEA THAT WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SIN
AND TO THESE ISLANDS SHOULD BE SENT PROFESSIONAL CRIMINALS THOSE WHO HAVE DELIBERATELY ADOPTED A LIFE OF CRIME FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THEMSELVES THE WOMEN UPON ONE ISLAND THE MEN UPON ANOTHER
WHAT INTEREST HAD THE DEVIL IN DEFEATING HIMSELF
I GIVE THESE INSTANCES TO SHOW YOU WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT ALWAYS WILL HAPPEN IN COUNTRIES WHERE IGNORANCE PREVAILS AND PEOPLE ABANDON THE GREAT STANDARD OF REASON
COULD PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL ENTER A HERD OF SWINE OR COULD PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH CHRIST
THE WORLD HAD BEEN CIRCUMNAVIGATED
EVERY SCIENCE RESTS ON THE NATURAL ON DEMONSTRATED FACTS
CHRIST WAS NOT A MAN BUT A MYTH--NOT A LIFE BUT A LEGEND
THE BRAIN MUST BE DEVELOPED
THERE WERE NO RAILWAYS AND THE ONLY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WERE WAGONS AND BOATS
IN OPTICS THEY DISCOVERED THAT A RAY OF LIGHT DID NOT PROCEED FROM THE EYE TO AN OBJECT--BUT FROM THE OBJECT TO THE EYE THEY WERE MANUFACTURERS OF COTTON LEATHER PAPER AND STEEL
LITTLE CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY LAW BECAUSE LAW FOR THE MOST PART ABOUT SUCH THINGS IS A DESTRUCTION OF PERSONAL LIBERTY
MY BRAIN AND HEART SAID NO
THEN I STUDIED BIOLOGY--NOT MUCH--JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW SOMETHING OF ANIMAL FORMS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT LIFE EXISTED WHEN THE LAURENTIAN ROCKS WERE MADE--JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IMPLEMENTS OF STONE IMPLEMENTS THAT HAD BEEN FORMED BY HUMAN HANDS HAD BEEN FOUND MINGLED WITH THE BONES OF EXTINCT ANIMALS BONES THAT HAD BEEN SPLIT WITH THESE IMPLEMENTS AND THAT THESE ANIMALS HAD CEASED TO EXIST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE MANUFACTURE OF ADAM AND EVE
THERE IS NO CONSTANCY IN QUALITIES RELATIONS OR RESULTS
AND THERE IS ONE THING THAT HELPS TO WIDEN THIS GULF
ACCORDING TO HIM THE WORLD WAS COMPOSED FIRST OF A FLAT PIECE OF LAND AND CIRCULAR
SO THESE DEVILS MUST HAVE BRAINS
HE BELIEVED THAT THE WATERS HAD BEEN DIVIDED AND THAT THE RAIN CAME FROM ABOVE THE FIRMAMENT
MEN AND WOMEN WHO PRETEND TO AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY WHO THINK ONE WAY AND TALK ANOTHER CAN HARDLY EXPECT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE ABSOLUTELY SINCERE
HE IS AS LIE WAS
AND WHENEVER THAT GRANT IS NOT FOR THE GOOD OF THE MANY IT SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM THE FEW--NOT BY FORCE NOT BY ROBBERY BUT BY ESTIMATING FAIRLY THE VALUE OF THAT PROPERTY AND PAYING TO THEM ITS VALUE
ONE WHOSE SYMPATHY WITH LOVING ARMS EMBRACED ALL FORMS OF SUFFERING LIFE WHO HATED SLAVERY OF EVERY KIND WHO WAS AS NATURAL AS HEAVEN'S BLUE WITH HUMOR KINDLY AS AN AUTUMN DAY WITH WIT AS SHARP AS ITHURIEL'S SPEAR AND SCORN THAT BLASTED LIKE THE SIMOON'S BREATH
THAT WORD IS THE DISGRACE THE SHAME THE INFAMY OF OUR REVEALED RELIGION
WHY SHOULD WE PRAY TO HIM
THAT WORD IS THE DEPTH THE DUNGEON THE ABYSS FROM WHICH CIVILIZED MAN HAS EMERGED
THEY KNEW THAT GOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF CIVILIZING HIS CHILDREN HAD DEVOURED SOME WITH EARTHQUAKES DESTROYED SOME WITH STORMS OF FIRE KILLED SOME WITH HIS LIGHTNINGS MILLIONS WITH FAMINE WITH PESTILENCE AND SACRIFICED COUNTLESS THOUSANDS UPON THE FIELDS OF WAR
HE KNOWS THE PART THEY HAVE PLAYED IN ALL RELIGIONS
THAT BAPTISM IS USELESS
IF A GOOD AND INFINITELY POWERFUL GOD GOVERNS THIS WORLD HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR CYCLONES EARTHQUAKES PESTILENCE AND FAMINE
THE CHRISTIANS ARE COMPELLED TO SAY THAT CHRIST INTENDED TO BE SACRIFICED--THAT HE SELECTED JUDAS WITH THAT END IN VIEW AND THAT HE REFUSED TO DEFEND HIMSELF BECAUSE HE DESIRED TO BE CRUCIFIED
IT CAN BE GROUND TO POWDER--CHANGED FROM A SOLID TO A LIQUID--FROM A LIQUID TO A GAS--BUT IT ALL REMAINS
THIS IS NATURAL
HIS HATRED ENDED AT THE GRAVE
ANYTHING THEY COULD NOT DODGE THEY SWALLOWED AND ANYTHING THEY COULD NOT SWALLOW THEY DODGED
IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO THINK THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE AND THEN THEY MIGHT CONTRADICT THE CREED DISPUTE THE WORDS OF PRIESTS AND DEFY THE CHURCH
IT FILLED THE DARKNESS WITH DEMONS--THE AIR WITH DEVILS AND THE WORLD WITH GRIEF AND SHAME
THEY ARE FILLED WITH HOLY WRATH AGAINST BICYCLES AND BLOOMERS
WAS SATAN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO THINK THAT HE COULD MISLEAD GOD AND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE DEVIL OFFERED TO GIVE THE WORLD AS A BRIBE TO ITS CREATOR AND OWNER KNOWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT CHRIST WAS THE CREATOR AND OWNER AND ALSO KNOWING THAT HE CHRIST KNEW THAT HE THE DEVIL KNEW THAT HE CHRIST WAS THE CREATOR AND OWNER
THIS IS THE GENERAL RULE TO WHICH THERE ARE MANY EXCEPTIONS
IN THE OLD THERE IS NO THREAT OF ETERNAL PAIN
SCIENCE THE ONLY POSSIBLE SAVIOR OF MANKIND MUST PUT IT IN THE POWER OF WOMAN TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF WHETHER SHE WILL OR WILL NOT BECOME A MOTHER
HE LEFT JUST A LITTLE NOTE SAYING
NOTHING COULD ADD TO THE HORROR OF HELL EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF ITS CREATOR GOD
IN THE GREAT CREED ARE ALL THE TRUTHS THAT LIPS HAVE UTTERED AND IN THE REAL LITANY WILL BE FOUND ALL THE ECSTASIES AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE SOUL ALL DREAMS OF JOY ALL HOPES FOR NOBLER FULLER LIFE
A RELIGION TO COMMAND THE RESPECT OF INTELLIGENT MEN SHOULD REST ON A FOUNDATION OF ESTABLISHED FACTS
WHO CAN IMAGINE AN INFINITE PERSONALITY
THE OLD MAN ANSWERED THAT HE HAD MADE NO PREPARATION THAT HE WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN--THAT HE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING BUT WORK
AS A RULE THE FORTUNE OWNS THEM
THEY PARALYZE THE MINDS AND POLLUTE THE IMAGINATIONS OF CHILDREN
THE SUN WAS REGARDED AS A GOD WHO FOUGHT THE DARKNESS THE POWER OF EVIL THE ENEMY OF MAN
THE MEN WHO INVENTED THE TELEGRAPHS AND CABLES AND FREIGHTED THE ELECTRIC SPARK WITH THOUGHT AND LOVE
I THANK THE GREAT POETS--THE DRAMATISTS
THIS BELIEF IN THE EFFICACY OF BONES OR RAGS AND HOLY HAIR WAS BORN OF ANOTHER BELIEF--THE BELIEF THAT ALL DISEASES WERE PRODUCED BY EVIL SPIRITS
BACK OF THE EVIL THE DEVIL
WHAT ORTHODOX CHURCH HAS OPENED ITS DOORS TO A PERSECUTED TRUTH
YE CANNOT BE PARTAKERS OF THE LORD'S TABLE AND THE TABLE OF DEVILS
HELL WAS IMAGINED BY REVENGE AND THE ORTHODOX HEAVEN IS THE SELFISH DREAM OF HEARTLESS SERFS AND SLAVES
I COMPARED SHAKESPEARE'S WOMEN--HIS PERFECT WOMEN--WITH THE WOMEN OF THE BIBLE
THAT IS ALL I ASK
SOME OF THE FORCES WORK FOR WHAT MAN CALLS GOOD
IN A FEW YEARS THE PULPITS WILL BE FILLED WITH TEACHERS INSTEAD OF PREACHERS--WITH THOUGHTFUL BRAVE AND HONEST MEN
WINDS THAT HAVE SAINTED HER TELL YE THE STORY OF THE YOUNG LIFE BY THE NEEDLE THAT BLED MAKING A BRIDGE OVER DEATH'S SOUNDLESS WATERS OUT OF A SWAYING AND SOUL-CUTTING THREAD OVER IT GOING ALL THE WORLD KNOWING THAT THOUSANDS HAVE TROD IT FOOT-BLEEDING BEFORE
HE TURNS AND WITH A CRY OF HORROR TAKES TO HIS HEELS
AND YET I HAVE KINDNESS AND CANDOR ENOUGH TO SAY THAT CALVIN AND EDWARDS WERE BOTH INSANE
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND BUT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW PRIESTS THEOLOGIANS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN--OF THEIR GENTLENESS--THEIR LOVE OF APPROBATION
THE ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD IS A POWER AND FORCE THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
THEY APPEAL TO HOPES AND FEARS
HOW MEN--GOOD MEN--CAN WORSHIP THIS GOD
HE CALLED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE TRIUMPHANT BEAST HE WAS IMPRISONED FOR MANY YEARS TRIED CONVICTED AND ON THE 16TH DAY OF FEBRUARY 1600 BURNED IN ROME BY MEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST BURNED ON THE SPOT WHERE NOW HIS MONUMENT RISES
MAN HAS A LITTLE INTELLIGENCE AND HE SHOULD USE IT
GOD AN IMPOSSIBLE BEING--THE PANORAMA OF THE PAST--XI
BY COMPARING LONG PERIODS OF TIME WE MORE CLEARLY PERCEIVE THE ADVANCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE
HE TAUGHT THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS
I GAVE UP THE OLD TESTAMENT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MISTAKES ITS ABSURDITIES ITS IGNORANCE AND ITS CRUELTY
BY THE SACRED DUST FILLING INNUMERABLE GRAVES
I WOULD INVOKE THE SAME POWER TO PRESERVE THESE HOMES AND TO ACQUIRE THESE HOMES THAT I WOULD INVOKE FOR ACQUIRING LANDS FOR BUILDING RAILWAYS
THE TREMENDOUS VERITIES OF ETERNAL JOY OF EVERLASTING PAIN ARE IN HIS CREED AND THEY RESULT FROM BELIEVING THE FALSE AND DENYING THE TRUE
AT LAST ORLANDO ENGAGED HIM SINGLY
THE NEXT TIME YOU LOOK WITH SCORN UPON A CONVICT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO DO ONE THING
THAT WORD IS A DEN A CAVE IN WHICH CRAWL THE SLIMY REPTILES OF REVENGE
WE KNOW A FEW FACTS A FEW FRAGMENTS AND THE IMAGINATION THE ARTIST OF THE MIND WITH THESE FACTS THESE FRAGMENTS REBUILDS THE PAST AND ON THE CANVAS OF THE FUTURE DEFTLY PAINTS THE THINGS TO BE
IN THIS WAY HE CORRUPTED THE CHILDREN OF MEN
DID YOU EVER READ THAT WONDERFUL POEM ABOUT THE SEWING WOMAN
IT IS THIS DEVIL THAT BRINGS THE SORROWS AND LOSSES ON THE UPRIGHT MAN
SO CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES TO UNDERSTAND AND IF POSSIBLE TO KNOW
PLANTED IN THEIR HEARTS THE LOVE OF LIBERTY ASSISTED THEM TO BREAK THEIR CHAINS TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR PRISONS AND BESOUGHT THEM TO THINK
I ANSWER SO HAVE THE WHITES UNTIL VERY RECENTLY
THERE WAS NO PROGRESS NO INVENTION NO DISCOVERY
THROUGH MILLIONS OF AGES BY COUNTLESS EFFORTS TO SATISFY HIS WANTS TO GRATIFY HIS PASSIONS HIS APPETITES MAN SLOWLY DEVELOPED HIS BRAIN CHANGED TWO OF HIS FEET INTO HANDS AND FORCED INTO THE DARKNESS OF HIS BRAIN A FEW GLEAMS AND GLIMMERINGS OF REASON
AN IMPOSSIBLE BEING
HE WILL PUT ROOF AND RAIMENT FOOD AND FUEL HOME AND HAPPINESS WITHIN THE REACH OF ALL
LORD BACON WAS THE FIRST MAN OF NOTE WHO MAINTAINED THAT A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY WAS BOUND TO KEEP ITS PLIGHTED FAITH WITH AN INFIDEL ONE
IN EVERY DIRECTION HE WILL INCREASE HIS POWER
HIS LIMBS ARE CONVULSED
I KNOW THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CLERGYMEN ARE HONEST SELF-DENYING AND HUMANE--THAT THEY ARE DOING WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THEIR DUTY--DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO INDUCE MEN AND WOMEN TO LIVE PURE AND NOBLE LIVES
CERTAINLY THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
TO INSURE YOUR LIFE WAS TO INSULT HEAVEN
HOW THANKFUL WE SHOULD BE TO HIS SATANIC MAJESTY
THEN CHANGING HIS VOICE TO ONE OF SCORN AND LOATHING HE TOLD OF THE RICH MAN'S DEATH
MANY UTTERANCES ATTRIBUTED TO CHRIST SHOCK MY BRAIN AND HEART
TO DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN IS TO BE A SAINT IN THE HIGHEST AND IN THE NOBLEST SENSE
THE SAME FACES APPEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN AT THE BAR
OF A CHILD AND OFTTIMES IT HATH CAST HIM INTO THE FIRE AND INTO THE WATERS TO DESTROY HIM THEN CHRIST SAID
WERE THEY ALL CREATED AT THE SAME TIME OR DID THEY SPRING FROM A SINGLE PAIR
IN THE TENTH CHAPTER JESUS GIVES HIS TWELVE DISCIPLES POWER TO CAST OUT UNCLEAN SPIRITS
ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO WROTE PART OF THE NEW TESTAMENT SAYS THAT THE HOLY GHOST WAS THE FATHER OF CHRIST AND THAT SOMEBODY WHO WROTE ANOTHER PART OF THE NEW TESTAMENT SAYS THAT JOSEPH WAS THE FATHER OF CHRIST
THEY HAVE MADE LIGHTNING A MESSENGER AND SLAVE
JEHOVAH
THIS REQUIRED A POPULATION IN THE COUNTRY OF TEN OR TWELVE MILLIONS
NO GOD WHO PITIES THE SUFFERINGS OF INNOCENCE
THEY WOULD ABOLISH THE SUNDAY PAPER--STOP THE RUNNING OF CARS AND ALL PUBLIC CONVEYANCES ON THE HOLY DAY AND COMPEL ALL THE PEOPLE TO ENJOY SERMONS PRAYERS AND PSALMS
THE TENEMENT HOUSE IS THE ENEMY OF MODESTY THE ENEMY OF VIRTUE THE ENEMY OF PATRIOTISM
TO BUILD SHIPS TO NAVIGATE THE SEAS
TO DISREGARD THE TRUE RELATION BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT
YOU MAKE A WILD BEAST OF HIM AND HE COMES OUT OF THAT PLACE BRANDED IN BODY AND SOUL AND THEN YOU WON'T LET HIM REFORM IF HE WANTS TO
EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE THE COURAGE TO GIVE HIS HONEST THOUGHT
SPAIN TOLD HER BEADS AND CONTINUED TO PRAY TO THE VIRGIN
THEY COULD EMPLOY A GENTLEMAN OF ABILITY POSSIBLY OF GENIUS TO ADDRESS THEM ON SUNDAYS ON SUBJECTS THAT WOULD BE OF REAL INTEREST OF REAL IMPORTANCE
ANYBODY WHO COULD GET FRESH MEAT ONCE A WEEK WAS CONSIDERED RICH
HE KNOWS THAT A STRANGE CAT COULD BE DENIED ASYLUM WITHOUT BRINGING ANY MISFORTUNE TO THE FAMILY
A QUESTION THAT IS STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
CIVILIZED COUNTRY THEY CALL IT
VOLTAIRE--A STAR THAT SUPERSTITION'S DARKNESS CANNOT QUENCH
THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY THE GROWTH OF NATIONS OF PHILOSOPHIES THEORIES AND ABOVE ALL OF THE SCIENCES
THAT CHARLEMAGNE WAS OPPOSED BY A GIANT CALLED FENACUTE WHO WAS A DESCENDANT OF THE ANCIENT GOLIATH
WE ARE BEGINNING TO BELIEVE IN THE RELIGION OF USEFULNESS
SHALL WE THANK THE CHURCH'S GOD
THEY THINK THAT ALL THE SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN WASTED AND THAT ALL THE INCENSE HAS ASCENDED IN VAIN
HE HAD AN OBSERVING EYE A GENTLE HEART AND A SENSE OF THE ARTISTIC
AND THINK WHAT MAN HAS DONE TO PLEASE THE GODS
IF ANYTHING SHOULD BRING MANKIND TOGETHER IT OUGHT TO BE A COMMON BELIEF
STARTING ACROSS THE SEA ON FRIDAY COULD HAVE NO POSSIBLE EFFECT UPON THE WINDS OR WAVES OR TIDES ANY MORE THAN STARTING ON ANY OTHER DAY AND THE ONLY POSSIBLE REASON FOR THINKING FRIDAY UNLUCKY IS THE ASSERTION THAT IT IS SO
HE KEPT IT A SECRET AND WENT TO WORK FOR A FARMER
HE MUST BE FREE TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS ON ALL QUESTIONS
THESE MEN ARE THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE--OF INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS
THE SAINTS DID NOT ASSIST THEIR FELLOW-MEN
THE MAN OF STRAW THE MASTER OF THE ORTHODOX MINISTERS--HIS RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS--VIII
FOR EMULATION HATH A THOUSAND SONS THAT ONE BY ONE PURSUE
EXPOSE THYSELF TO FEEL WHAT WRETCHES FEEL THAT THOU MAY'ST SHAKE THE SUPERFLUX TO THEM AND SHOW THE HEAVENS MORE JUST THAT IS ONE OF THE NOBLEST PRAYERS THAT EVER FELL FROM HUMAN LIPS
WITH THIS BELIEF A KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE SHEDS NO LIGHT UPON THE PATH TO BE PURSUED
ABOUT THE SAME TIME IT WAS CURRENTLY REPORTED AND BELIEVED THAT A CHILD HAD BEEN BORN IN SILESIA WITH A GOLDEN TOOTH
STAR AFTER STAR AROSE IN THE FIRMAMENT OF IGNORANCE
BRUNO THE NOBLEST THE GREATEST OF ALL THE MARTYRS
AGAINST THIS INUNDATION OF VICE THE FORCES OF REFORM ARE HELPLESS AND CHARITY ITSELF BECOMES AN UNCONSCIOUS PROMOTER OF CRIME
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DEVIL WAS THE AUTHOR OF ALL EVIL
HARK FROM THE TOMBS A DOLEFUL SOUND NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN
BUT THE INSANE WERE TREATED AS CRIMINALS
MORNING AND EVENING THE SACRED VOLUME WAS OPENED AND PRAYERS WERE SAID
THERE IS NO WELCOME IN THE VELVET FOR THE VELVETEEN
DEATH THAT TAKES THE MOTHER FROM HER HELPLESS DIMPLED CHILD--DEATH THAT FILLS THE WORLD WITH GRIEF AND TEARS
THEN ENTERED SATAN INTO JUDAS ISCARIOT BEING OF THE NUMBER OF THE TWELVE AND HE WENT HIS WAY AND COMMUNED WITH THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND CAPTAINS HOW HE MIGHT BETRAY HIM UNTO THEM
THIS INFINITELY FOOLISH STUFF WAS RELIGIOUSLY BELIEVED BY HIM MERELY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN RAISED IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF BOUNDLESS CREDULITY
THEY TELL US THAT THE CHURCH HAS BEEN AND IS THE FRIEND OF EDUCATION
PROGRESS BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE
DOES ANY ONE IMAGINE THAT THE AUTHOR OF GENESIS KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SUN--ITS SIZE
HOW IT DARKENED THE MIND HARDENED THE HEART AND POISONED LIFE
THIS IS THE GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SAVAGE AND THE CIVILIZED
THIS IS TRUE MANHOOD
THERE IS NO DARKNESS BUT IGNORANCE THERE IS NO LIGHT BUT INTELLIGENCE AS OFTEN AS WE CAN EXCHANGE A MISTAKE FOR A FACT A FALSEHOOD FOR A TRUTH WE ADVANCE
HE MUST HAVE RESTED ON TUESDAY
THE INVENTORS OF ALL THE WONDERFUL MACHINES THAT DEFTLY MOULD FROM WOOD AND STEEL THE THINGS WE USE
THAT MONEY WILL ROB HIS DAYS OF SUNSHINE AND HIS NIGHTS OF PLEASANT DREAMS
THEY HAVE RESCUED US FROM THE PRISONS OF FEAR AND SNATCHED OUR SOULS FROM THE FANGS AND CLAWS OF SUPERSTITION'S LOATHSOME CRAWLING FLYING BEASTS
V
V
V
V
HE TELLS US THAT AFTER EIGHT DAYS THE CHILD WAS NAMED JESUS
THE MEN OF SCIENCE HUMBOLDT DARWIN SPENCER HUXLEY HAECKEL--IX
WHY WOULD A MERCIFUL GOD ALLOW HIS CHILDREN TO BE THE VICTIMS OF DEVILS
AND YET THE NUMBER OF THIEVES AND CRIMINALS OF ALL GRADES INCREASED
OF COURSE THESE DEVILS WERE ALL MADE BY THE PEOPLE AND IN THESE DEVILS WE FIND THE PREJUDICES OF THEIR MAKERS
EACH ONE IS EQUAL TO HIMSELF AND THE OTHER TWO
KNOWS THAT THE END IS ABSOLUTE AND ETERNAL FAILURE
ALL THE FORCES OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN FAVOR OF MORALITY AND TEMPERANCE
YET WE CANNOT GIVE CHRISTIANITY THE CREDIT BECAUSE BACON WAS AN INFIDEL AND WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT IN ALL THINGS REASON MUST BE THE STANDARD
THE NAME OF THIS MAN SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
TRUTH LOVES THE LIGHT AND THE OPEN FIELD
THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY MORAL SUASION
THEY BELIEVED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT--IN THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST AND THEY KNEW THAT THE PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OF THE SAVIOR WAS CASTING OUT DEVILS
ABADDON WHO CAUSED WARS TUMULTS AND COMBUSTIONS
CAN WE HASTEN OR DELAY THE TIDES BY WORSHIP
THE LITERATURE OF THE WORLD SHOULD BE OPEN TO HIM--NOTHING PROHIBITED SEALED OR HIDDEN
THE JEHOVAH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IS THE GOD OF THE CHRISTIANS
WE HAVE NO DREAD NO FEAR TO PASS BEYOND THE VEIL THAT HIDES THE DEAD
HE WAS CAST OUT INTO THE EARTH AND HIS ANGELS WERE CAST OUT WITH HIM
WE MUST GIVE UP THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST
I TELL YOU TO-NIGHT THAT THESE THINGS ARE WORTH THINKING ABOUT
THERE IS STILL ANOTHER TROUBLE
HE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DESERT HER BECAUSE SHE HAS GROWN WRINKLED AND OLD
HE CANNOT WANT
HE KNOWS HOW THESE MALEVOLENT MYTHS WERE MADE
IN THE NINTH CHAPTER OF MATTHEW THERE WAS A DUMB MAN BROUGHT TO JESUS POSSESSED WITH A DEVIL
FOR THEIR PRESERVATION AND PUNISHMENT HE WROUGHT COUNTLESS MIRACLES GAVE THEM MANY LAWS AND A GREAT DEAL OF ADVICE
LANGUAGE
THE AIR FILLED WITH SERENITY
THERE CAN BE NO REAL MARRIAGE WITHOUT MUTUAL LOVE
A FEW YEARS AGO ITALY WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO BUILD A MONUMENT TO GIORDANO BRUNO--BRUNO THE VICTIM OF THE TRIUMPHANT BEAST;"--BRUNO THE SUBLIMEST OF HER SONS
WHOM WHAT SHOULD WE THANK
A SENSELESS FORCE WE DO NOT BLESS IN SOLEMN TONE
WHY SHOULD WE SPEAK OF A BEING WITHOUT BODY AS OF THE MASCULINE GENDER
JEHOVAH HAD NO ETERNAL PRISON--NO EVERLASTING FIRE
ON EVERY HAND THERE SEEMS TO BE EVIDENCE OF DESIGN--DESIGN FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOOD DESIGN FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF EVIL
THEY ARE LITERALISTS
DURING THE JOURNEY OF LIFE THEY KEPT THEIR EYES ON THE GRAVE
WHEN KNOWLEDGE IS PERFECT THERE CAN BE NO PASSION NO EMOTION
JESUS WHEN ON HIS WAY TO JERUSALEM FOR THE LAST TIME SAID SPEAKING TO THE TWELVE DISCIPLES JUDAS BEING PRESENT THAT THEY THE DISCIPLES SHOULD THEREAFTER SIT ON TWELVE THRONES JUDGING THE TWELVE TRIBES OF ISRAEL
THE SAVAGE FEELS BUT SCARCELY THINKS
WHAT IS THE REMEDY
WHY DID GOD WISH TO BE TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL
SCIENCE SHEDS LIGHT
WE ARE TOLD THAT AT THE SAME TIME A GOOD WAY OFF MANY SWINE WERE FEEDING AND THAT THE DEVILS BESOUGHT CHRIST SAYING
THE POOR DELUDED GIRLS IMAGINED THAT THEY IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY WERE IN SPIRITUAL WEDLOCK UNITED WITH GOD
OSIRIS BACCHUS AND MITHRA HERMES BUDDHA AND QUETZALCOATL PROMETHEUS ZOROASTER AND PERSEUS CADOM LAO-TSZE FO-HI HORUS AND RAMESES WERE ALL SUN-GODS
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW MARK AND LUKE CHRIST TAUGHT THAT IF YOU WOULD FORGIVE OTHERS GOD WOULD FORGIVE YOU
YET SOME PEOPLE WOULD DESTROY THE SUN TO PREVENT THE GROWTH OF WEEDS
WHOM SHALL WE THANK
A WOMAN WAS TRIED BEFORE SIR MATTHEW HALE ONE OF THE MOST LEARNED AND CELEBRATED LAWYERS OF ENGLAND FOR HAVING CAUSED CHILDREN TO VOMIT-CROOKED PINS
BOOKS THAT CONTRADICTED THE BIBLE WERE HURTFUL THOSE THAT AGREED WITH IT--USELESS
THEY CONSIDERED THEIR CASE HOPELESS
NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL A DAY IN HIS LIFE AND CARED NO MORE ABOUT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE THAN ANDY JOHNSON
EVERY CHILD SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT THE USEFUL ARE THE HONORABLE AND THAT THEY WHO LIVE ON THE LABOR OF OTHERS ARE THE ENEMIES OF SOCIETY
GALILEO WAS ARRESTED IMPRISONED FORCED TO FALL UPON HIS KNEES PUT HIS HAND ON THE BIBLE AND RECANT
THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS DECREE JOSEPH AND MARY WENT TO BETHLEHEM TO BE TAXED
THE EUROPEANS ALWAYS REPRESENT THEIR DEVILS AS BLACK WHILE THE AFRICANS BELIEVED THAT THEIRS WERE WHITE
IT SHOULD BE THE INTELLECTUAL CENTRE
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO CHRISTIANITY
TO FEEL FREE UNTRAMMELED IRRESPONSIBLE JOYOUS,--TO FORGET CARE AND DEATH--TO BE FLOODED WITH SUNSHINE WITHOUT A FEAR OF NIGHT--TO FORGET THE PAST TO HAVE NO THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE NO DREAM OF GOD OR HEAVEN OR HELL--TO BE INTOXICATED WITH THE PRESENT--TO BE CONSCIOUS ONLY OF THE CLASP AND KISS OF THE ONE YOU LOVE--THIS IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST
ASTRONOMY BECAME A SCIENCE AND CHRISTIANITY A SUPERSTITION
HE BELIEVED THAT GOD WAS A LOVING FATHER THAT HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF HIS CHILDREN THAT THEY NEED DO NOTHING EXCEPT TO RELY IMPLICITLY ON GOD
CHRIST ACCORDING TO THE FAITH IS THE SECOND PERSON IN THE TRINITY THE FATHER BEING THE FIRST AND THE HOLY GHOST THE THIRD
WHOEVER DOES WRONG PLAGUES HIMSELF AND WHEN HE REAPS THAT HARVEST HE WILL FIND THAT HE WAS NOT PRACTICING SELF-DENIAL WHEN HE DID RIGHT
RELIGION CAN NEVER REFORM MANKIND BECAUSE RELIGION IS SLAVERY
THEY WERE NOT EVEN ORDAINED
IT GAVE US AN IGNORANT JEALOUS REVENGEFUL AND CRUEL GOD--SOMETIMES MERCIFUL--SOMETIMES FEROCIOUS
IN A LITTLE WHILE HE DIES AND THAT IS ALL
THE SORCERER SUPERSTITION CHANGES DEBT TO CREDIT
IN SHORT LABOR WAS DISGRACEFUL
I THANK BURNS FOR THE HEART-THROBS HE CHANGED INTO SONGS FOR HIS LYRICS OF FLAME
EVERY THOUGHT BEHIND WHICH IS THE TEAR OF PITY I APPRECIATE AND LOVE
THEN THE SCHOOLMASTER CARRIED ON THE WAR AGAINST THEIR NATURAL SENSE AND ALL THE BOOKS THEY READ WERE FILLED WITH THE SAME IMPOSSIBLE TRUTHS
NO MATTER WHETHER THEY CALL IT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT OR PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY--DO NOT GO WITH IT UNLESS IT GOES YOUR WAY
THE DEVIL
THE DEVIL
IF THE MINISTER TAKES IT BACK--GOOD
SUCH DIVORCE TO BE GRANTED ON EQUITABLE TERMS
THEY OUGHT TO KNOW NOW THAT THIS DOGMA IS UTTERLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE WISDOM THE JUSTICE THE GOODNESS OF THEIR GOD
THAT HE DID NOTHING OF THE KIND
THE CHURCH INSISTS THAT IT HAS MADE MAN MERCIFUL AND JUST
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE TEACHES US THAT THIS MUST BE TRUE
AND THEY WERE NEARLY ALL ON AN EQUALITY AND COMPARATIVELY THERE WERE FEWER FAILURES
I BLAME NO ONE
WITH BOTANY ENTOMOLOGY SOMETHING OF GEOLOGY AND ASTRONOMY
THERE WAS JENKYN ON THE ATONEMENT WHO DEMONSTRATED THE WISDOM OF GOD IN DEVISING A WAY IN WHICH THE SUFFERINGS OF INNOCENCE COULD JUSTIFY THE GUILTY
EVERY CHILD SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO BE SELF-SUPPORTING AND EVERY ONE SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO AVOID BEING A BURDEN ON OTHERS AS THEY WOULD SHUN DEATH
IN THE TIME OF CHARLES THE FIFTH EMPEROR OF GERMANY STOEFFLERER A NOTED MATHEMATICIAN AND ASTRONOMER A MAN OF GREAT LEARNING MADE AN ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATION ACCORDING TO THE GREAT SCIENCE OF ASTROLOGY AND ASCERTAINED THAT THE WORLD WAS TO BE VISITED BY ANOTHER DELUGE
THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS
THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS
AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL THEY MADE CAKES OF WHEAT AND SAID
THIS IS THE SAVAGERY OF CHRISTIANITY
ALL THESE THINGS WERE DONE WITH THE AID OF THE DEVIL WHO SOUGHT TO PERSECUTE THE FAITHFUL THE LAMBS OF GOD
THEY DID NOT APPEAL TO FORCE OR FEAR
IT MAY BE THAT HYPOCRITES TRANSMIT THEIR FAILING TO THEIR OFFSPRING
THE TRUTH IS THAT PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE OLD THEORIES
I ADMIT THAT PEOPLE DID THE BEST THEY COULD TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT THEY SAW FOR WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED
THEY REGARDED PHYSICIANS AS THE ENEMIES OF GOD--AS MEN WHO WERE TRYING TO DEFEAT THE DECREES OF PROVIDENCE
BREAKFAST WITHOUT POTATOES
EVERYTHING WAS THE WORK OF SPIRITS
THEY ARE OPPOSED TO DIVORCES
I READ BYRON--READ HIS CAIN IN WHICH AS IN PARADISE LOST THE DEVIL SEEMS TO BE THE BETTER GOD--READ HIS BEAUTIFUL SUBLIME AND BITTER LINES--READ HIS PRISONER OF CHILLON--HIS BEST--A POEM THAT FILLED MY HEART WITH TENDERNESS WITH PITY AND WITH AN ETERNAL HATRED OF TYRANNY
WE KNOW SOMETHING OF THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD--SOMETHING OF THE HUMAN RACE
SLAVERY IS A VERY ANCIENT INSTITUTION YES ABOUT AS ANCIENT AS ROBBERY THEFT AND MURDER AND IS BASED UPON THEM ALL
NONE UNLESS ALL THINGS FOUND IN BOOKS ARE TRUE
WHAT HAVE THE WORDLY DONE
WHAT HAVE THE WORDLY DONE
I THANK THE GREAT MECHANICS THE WORKERS IN IRON AND STEEL IN WOOD AND STONE
THIS IS THE CONSOLATION OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION
THE FOLLOWING PASSAGES SHOW THAT CHRIST WAS A DEVOUT JEW
DID THEY SLIP BACK INTO THEIR GRAVES AND COMMIT SUICIDE
WHAT OBJECT HAS HE IN LIFE
THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
THE CLERGY WHO WERE AS FAMILIAR WITH GOD THEN AS THE ORTHODOX PREACHERS ARE NOW KNEW EXACTLY THE MEANING OF ECLIPSES AND SUN DOGS AND NORTHERN LIGHTS
THE DOGMAS OF THE FALL OF MAN THE ATONEMENT AND SALVATION BY FAITH ARE FAR OLDER THAN OUR RELIGION
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE BOOK OF RUTH WAS WRITTEN BY AN INSPIRED MAN
BEHIND THE THINGS THAT INJURE MAN THERE IS NO PURPOSE THOUGHT OR PLAN
THESE DEVILS ASSUMED A THOUSAND FORMS--COUNTLESS DISGUISES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CAPTURE SOULS AND DESTROY THE CHURCH
WHAT GOOD HAS THE CHURCH DONE
THEY PLACE NO RELIANCE ON GENERAL OR SPECIAL PROVIDENCE--ON ANY POWER THAT RESCUES PROTECTS AND SAVES THE GOOD OR PUNISHES THE VILE AND VICIOUS
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER REFORMATION IS POSSIBLE WHETHER A CHANGE CAN BE PRODUCED IN THE PERSON BY PRODUCING A CHANGE IN THE CONDITIONS
WE WILL FINALLY SAY THAT HUMAN FLESH HUMAN LABOR SHALL NOT DEPEND ENTIRELY ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAT IS INFINITELY CRUEL
WEALTH GIVES POWER
IN THE TWENTIETH CHAPTER OF REVELATION IS THE FOLLOWING
THEY SHOULD BELONG TO THE FAMILY SO THAT EVERY MOTHER SHOULD FEEL THAT THE ROOF ABOVE HER HEAD WAS HERS
WITH PROPHECIES THAT DROVE THE DREAMERS MAD
IF THESE ADDERS THESE VIPERS WERE COILED IN HIS BOSOM WAS HE THE SON OF GOD
TO CLASP THE WOMAN YOU LOVE IN YOUR ARMS AND TO KNOW THAT SHE IS YOURS AND FOREVER--YOURS THOUGH SUNS DARKEN AND CONSTELLATIONS VANISH
THE PRESS HAS BEEN THE TRUE PROMETHEUS
PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD THAT YE MAY BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST THE WILES OF THE DEVIL AND IN HEBREWS IT IS SAID THAT HIM THAT HAD THE POWER OF DEATH--THAT IS THE DEVIL SHOWING THAT THE DEVIL HAS THE POWER OF DEATH
AND THEN SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE WHAT IS CALLED BAD LUCK"--THAT IS TO SAY WHEN ANYTHING FALLS THEY ARE UNDER IT
I THANK THE ASTRONOMERS WHO EXPLORED THE HEAVENS TOLD US THE SECRETS OF THE STARS THE GLORIES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS--THE GEOLOGISTS WHO FOUND THE STORY OF THE WORLD IN FOSSIL FORMS IN MEMORANDA KEPT IN ANCIENT ROCKS IN LINES WRITTEN BY WAVES BY FROST AND FIRE--THE ANATOMISTS WHO SOUGHT IN MUSCLE NERVE AND BONE FOR ALL THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE--THE CHEMISTS WHO UNRAVELED NATURE'S WORK THAT THEY MIGHT LEARN HER ART--THE PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE LAID THE HAND OF SCIENCE ON THE BROW OF PAIN THE HAND WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH RESTORES--THE SURGEONS WHO HAVE DEFEATED NATURE'S SELF AND FORCED HER TO PRESERVE THE LIVES OF THOSE SHE LABORED TO DESTROY
WHY WOULD A DECENT GOD ALLOW HIS WORSHIPERS TO BELIEVE IN DEVILS AND BY REASON OF THAT BELIEF TO PERSECUTE TORTURE AND BURN THEIR FELLOW-MEN
LIKE A VENOMOUS SERPENT IT CRAWLS AND COILS AND HISSES IN EVERY ORTHODOX CREED
THEY LONG FOR REVENGE
THE INVENTORS THE WORKERS THE THINKERS THE MECHANICS THE SURGEONS THE PHILOSOPHERS--THESE ARE THE ATLASES UPON WHOSE SHOULDERS RESTS THE GREAT FABRIC OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
BUT WHILE THEY TALK ABOUT THIS GOD OF LOVE CYCLONES WRECK AND REND THE EARTHQUAKE DEVOURS THE FLOOD DESTROYS THE RED BOLT LEAPING FROM THE CLOUD STILL CRASHES THE LIFE OUT OF MEN AND PLAGUE AND FEVER STILL ARE TIRELESS REAPERS IN THE HARVEST FIELDS OF DEATH
THE NOBLEST OF OCCUPATIONS IS TO SEARCH FOR TRUTH
THEY WERE PROMISED REWARDS IN ANOTHER WORLD IF THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE SELF-DENIAL ENOUGH TO BE VIRTUOUS IN THIS
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT
IF THOU CAST US OUT SUFFER US TO GO AWAY INTO THE HERD OF SWINE AND HE SAID UNTO THEM
SO THERE ARE MANY REFERENCES TO DEVILS AND SPIRITS OF DIVINATION AND OF EVIL WHICH I HAVE NOT THE TIME TO CALL ATTENTION TO
WHERE THE NOBLEST AND THE BEST ARE DRIVEN TO SIBERIA THERE MAY BE A REASON FOR THE NIHILIST
AND BY FREQUENT REFUSAL THE HEART BECOMES HARD ENOUGH AND THE HAND GREEDY ENOUGH TO CLUTCH AND HOLD
PAUL SAYS THAT JESUS AFTER HIS RESURRECTION APPEARED TO THE TWELVE DISCIPLES
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MEN WORKED FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY
THAT THE PALLID FLESH OF THE DEAD FELT ONCE MORE THE THRILL OF LIFE
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR GOD TO FORGIVE MAN
THE CHILDREN WERE VICTIMS
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SUBLIME AND SLANDERED MAN
THE MARBLES OF THE GREEKS LIKE STRAINS OF MUSIC SUGGEST THE PERFECT AND TEACH THE MELODY OF LIFE
WHEN THE MINISTER LEAVES THE SEMINARY HE IS NOT SEEKING THE TRUTH
THE ROENTGEN RAYS THAT CHANGE THE OPAQUE TO THE TRANSPARENT
IF THE FIRST PERSON WHO ENTERS A THEATRE IS CROSSEYED THE AUDIENCE WILL BE SMALL AND THE RUN A FAILURE
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER FACT
THIS IS TO BE REALLY AND TRULY SPIRITUAL
IT WAS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN--TO ARREST ALL PROGRESS--AND TO DO THIS THE CHURCH USED ALL ITS POWER
THAT THE SPRITES THE SPOOKS THE HOBGOBLINS AND ALL THE MONSTERS OF THE IMAGINATION FLED FROM THE APPROACHING SUN
THEY FOLLOWED THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST
WHEN WE IMPRISONED PEOPLE FOR DEBT DEBTS WERE AS INSECURE TO SAY THE LEAST AS NOW
THIS FORCE IS NOT CONSCIOUS NOT INTELLIGENT
THE EMPLOYERS CANNOT GOVERN PRICES
IF DEVILS DO NOT EXIST THE FALL OF MAN IS A MISTAKE AND THE ATONEMENT AN ABSURDITY
HE HAS ESTABLISHED AND DESTROYED EMPIRES AND KINGDOMS DESPOTISMS AND REPUBLICS
IN HIS NAME HAVE BEEN PREACHED CHARITY,--FORGIVENESS AND LOVE
I SAID
RELIGION TEACHES THE SLAVE-VIRTUES--OBEDIENCE HUMILITY SELF-DENIAL FORGIVENESS NON-RESISTANCE
WE HAVE THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE NEW
IT SUBVERTED THE IDEA OF JUSTICE DROVE MERCY FROM THE HEART CHANGED MEN TO FIENDS AND BANISHED REASON FROM THE BRAIN
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE KING OF ALL THESE EVIL SPIRITS WAS THE DEVIL AND THAT THE KING OF ALL THE GOOD SPIRITS WAS GOD
THIS DEBT IS GROWING YEAR BY YEAR
SHUT YOUR EYES AND SAVE YOUR SOULS WHAT HAS THE CHURCH DONE
FOR MANY CENTURIES THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD WAS USED TO PROPITIATE THE UNSEEN POWERS
WOULD TORQUEMADA HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD HE BEEN A FOLLOWER OF ZOROASTER
AFTER ALL EPILEPSY IS NOT A THEOLOGIAN
OTHERS HAVE ADVOCATED ARBITRATION
MONTAIGNE WAS THE FIRST MAN WHO RAISED HIS VOICE AGAINST TORTURE IN FRANCE
NOW WE KNOW THAT IGNORANCE WAS THE MOTHER OF ALL THE AGONIES ENDURED
FROM THE VERY FIRST IT TAUGHT THE VANITY--THE WORTHLESSNESS OF ALL EARTHLY THINGS
THE THEOLOGIAN ARRIVES AT THE UNTHINKABLE THE INCONCEIVABLE AND HE CALLS THIS GOD
MARRIAGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL INSTITUTIONS
SCHOOLS IN WHICH TEACHERS KNEW LESS THAN PUPILS
IT NOT ONLY PROMISES THE FAITHFUL AN ETERNAL REWARD BUT DECLARES THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN IMPRISONED IN THE DUNGEONS OF GOD WILL SUFFER ETERNAL PAIN
THEY HAVE MADE THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD
SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT NO ORGANIZATION SECULAR OR RELIGIOUS SHALL BE MY MASTER
IF WE DO NOT DEVELOP WE SHRINK AND SHRIVEL
ONLY HYPOCRITES WOULD ASK FOR THE MONEY
POSSIBLY A MAIDEN'S MATRIMONIAL CHANCES ARE DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF SEEDS IN AN APPLE OR BY THE NUMBER OF LEAVES ON A FLOWER BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
AND YET LUTHER CALVIN KNOX AND BAXTER IN SPITE AS IT WERE OF THEMSELVES CONFERRED A GREAT AND LASTING BENEFIT UPON MANKIND
AT NIGHT YOU PUT HIM IN DARKNESS
THAT SOME OF THEM WERE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE FOOLISH CHILDISH AND IDIOTIC
WITCHES AND WIZARDS WERE CHANGED INTO WOLVES DOGS CATS AND SERPENTS
SOME OF THE POOR PUPPETS HE MAKES INSANE--MAKES THEM STRUGGLE IN THE DARKNESS WITH IMAGINED MONSTERS WITH GLARING EYES AND DRIPPING JAWS AND SOME ARE MADE WITHOUT THE FLAME OF THOUGHT TO DROOL AND DRIVEL THROUGH THE DARKENED DAYS
ONE EGG FROM WHICH WARMTH IN DARKNESS WOOS TO LIFE AN ORGANIZED AND BREATHING FORM--A FORM WITH SINEWS BONES AND NERVES WITH BLOOD AND BRAIN WITH INSTINCTS PASSIONS THOUGHTS AND WANTS--AS ALL THE STARS THAT WHEEL IN SPACE
THE THEOLOGIANS MADE THE BIBLE A MASTER AND THE PEOPLE ITS SLAVES
AN ACT PERFORMED BY A MASTER OF NATURE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FACTS IN NATURE
WAS THE HOLY GHOST ONLY THE PERSONIFICATION OF A FATHER
HUXLEY HAD INTELLIGENCE INDUSTRY GENIUS AND THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHT
IN VIEW OF THESE FACTS WHAT AFTER ALL IS RELIGION
THE BLACK ART THE IMPOSSIBLE WAS ABANDONED AND CHEMISTRY THE USEFUL TOOK ITS PLACE
EVERY VERSE THAT IS TRUE AND TENDER I TREASURE IN MY HEART
THAT THEY HAD NO MORE REFERENCE TO HUMAN BEINGS THAN TO COLONIES OF ANTS HIVES OF BEES OR THE EGGS OF INSECTS
IT SACRIFICED THE WISEST THE BRAVEST AND THE BEST
SAVE POOR CHILDREN FROM THE POLLUTION OF THIS HORROR
I THANK HUXLEY AND SPENCER
I ADMIT THAT THEY LOOKED OVER A NUMBER OF JEWISH BOOKS AND PICKED OUT THE ONES THAT JEHOVAH WROTE
I READ VOLTAIRE--VOLTAIRE THE GREATEST MAN OF HIS CENTURY AND WHO DID MORE FOR LIBERTY OF THOUGHT AND SPEECH THAN ANY OTHER BEING HUMAN OR DIVINE VOLTAIRE WHO TORE THE MASK FROM HYPOCRISY AND FOUND BEHIND THE PAINTED SMILE THE FANGS OF HATE
ACCORDING TO THE SACRED SCRIPTURES MAN HAS BEEN ON THIS EARTH FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE YEARS AND NO MORE
IT FEARED THOUGHT--BUT IT PRESERVED THE SCRIPTURES THE RAVINGS OF INSANE SAINTS THE FALSEHOODS OF THE FATHERS THE BULLS OF POPES THE ACCOUNTS OF MIRACLES PERFORMED BY SHRINES BY DRIED BLOOD AND FADED HAIR BY PIECES OF BONES AND WOOD BY RUSTY NAILS AND THORNS BY HANDKERCHIEFS AND RAGS BY WATER AND BEADS AND BY A FINGER OF THE HOLY GHOST
ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE CHILDREN OF LOVE
IN THE DEDICATION OF THIS BLESSED BIBLE THE QUEEN WAS PIOUSLY EXHORTED TO PUT ALL PAPISTS TO THE SWORD IN THIS INCIDENT WE SEE THE REAL SPIRIT OF PROTESTANT LOVERS OF THE BIBLE
TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THESE EVIL SPIRITS TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL IS TO DENY THE TRUTH OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
THEY LIVE ON ALMS
LONG AGO THEY FOLDED THEIR PINIONS AND FADED FROM THE EARTH AND AIR
I SEE THE COMMON THINGS OF LIFE CHANGE TO MIRACLES AS THEY SPEED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH
EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE SHOULD BE DONE TO KEEP THIS FROM BEING A NATION OF TENANTS
THAT MEANS COMPANY MOST PEOPLE WILL ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN DROPPING THE CLOTH AND THE COMING OF VISITORS
THEIR HISTORIES WERE THE GROSSEST AND MOST PALPABLE FALSEHOODS AND THEY FILLED ALL EUROPE WITH THE MOST SHOCKING ABSURDITIES
THEY RELATED ALL THE PAST AND PRESENT AND PREDICTED NEARLY ALL THE FUTURE WITH AN IGNORANT IMPUDENCE ACTUALLY SUBLIME
HE HELPS HIMSELF
LET US HOPE IF THERE BE A GOD THAT HE IS WISE AND GOOD
WAS THE DEVIL IN THIS CASE A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL
THEN CAME ELECTRIC LIGHT THAT FILLS THE NIGHT WITH DAY AND ALL THE WONDERFUL MACHINES THAT USE THE SUBTLE FORCE--THE SAME FORCE THAT LEAPS FROM THE SUMMER CLOUD TO RAVAGE AND DESTROY
HOW BEAUTIFUL HOW ENCHANTING DEATH WOULD BE
THE OTHER THE REFORMATION OF THE CRIMINAL
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT--AGAINST MAINTAINING YOUR SELF-RESPECT AND PRESERVING THE SPOTLESS AND STAINLESS VERACITY OF THE SOUL
BUT THE MAN WHO CONFESSED HIMSELF GUILTY OF BEING A WIZARD KNEW THAT HIS MEMORY WOULD BE EXECRATED AND EXPECTED THAT HIS SOUL WOULD BE ETERNALLY LOST
NO GOD WHO CARES FOR THE SLAVES WITH SCARRED FLESH THE MOTHERS ROBBED OF THEIR BABES
IF THERE IS NO FOOD IN THIS COUNTRY THE BOAT AND THE CAR WILL BRING IT FROM ANOTHER
WE HAD MANY VOLUMES OF ORTHODOX SERMONS FILLED WITH WRATH AND THE TERRORS OF THE JUDGMENT TO COME--SERMONS THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY SAVAGE SAINTS
THEY HAVE DRIVEN FROM THE HEART THE FIENDS OF FEAR AND EXTINGUISHED THE FLAMES OF HELL
THEY WERE TREATED LIKE WILD BEASTS
DISEASE WAS PRODUCED BY DEVILS AND COULD BE CURED ONLY BY PRIESTS DECAYING BONES AND HOLY WATER
IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF SUCH A BEING AS TO IMAGINE A SQUARE TRIANGLE OR TO THINK OF A CIRCLE WITHOUT A DIAMETER
OF WHAT SCIENCE HAS THE CHURCH BEEN THE FRIEND AND CHAMPION
X
X
MAKE ALL HIS POOR RELATIONS HATE HIM
BACK OF ALL THAT IS--BACK OF ALL EVENTS--CHRISTIANS PUT AN INFINITE JUGGLER WHO WITH A WISH CREATES PRESERVES DESTROYS
SUPERSTITION TAUGHT THAT HUMAN LOVE IS DEGRADING LOW AND VILE
WE ARE TOLD IN MATTHEW CHAPTER XXIII VERSE 35 THAT CHRIST SAID
THEOLOGY IS THE ONLY DISHONEST SCIENCE--THE ONLY ONE THAT IS BASED ON BELIEF--ON CREDULITY,--THE ONLY ONE THAT ABHORS INVESTIGATION THAT DESPISES THOUGHT AND DENOUNCES REASON
ERRO IN A BOOK PUBLISHED AT MADRID TOOK THE GROUND THAT BASQUE WAS THE LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN
THEY EXCUSED THE SLAVERY AND POLYGAMY THE ROBBERY AND MURDER UPHELD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT BY SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE WERE SO DEGRADED THAT JEHOVAH WAS COMPELLED TO PANDER TO THEIR IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE
NO ONE DREAMED OF SUCH A THING AS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
THE IMAGINATION IS POLLUTED WITH THE DEFORMED THE MONSTROUS AND MALICIOUS
THERE IS NO WAY OF SETTLING THEIR DISPUTES
THERE WERE BUT THREE HOUSES UPON IT
IN THE FIFTH CHAPTER OF ACTS WE ARE TOLD THAT THE PEOPLE BROUGHT THE SICK AND THOSE WHICH WERE VEXED WITH UNCLEAN SPIRITS TO THE APOSTLES AND THE APOSTLES HEALED THEM
THEY WERE BUILT BY SLAVES TO SATISFY THE VANITY AND AMBITION OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS
THE FOURTH STONE IS THAT THAT WHICH CANNOT BE DESTROYED COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CREATED
I NOW CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO ANOTHER TERRIBLE PHASE OF THIS SUBJECT
IT WILL PUT HONESTY ABOVE HYPOCRISY
MAGELLAN LEFT SEVILLE SPAIN AUGUST 10TH 1519 SAILED WEST AND KEPT SAILING WEST AND THE SHIP REACHED SEVILLE THE PORT IT LEFT ON SEPT
HERE WAS A NATURAL HONEST MAN
IT IS AN INSANITY TO GET MORE THAN YOU WANT
IT WAS ALSO THE LAW THAT NO COLLIER COULD WORK IN ANY MINE EXCEPT THE ONE TO WHICH HE BELONGED
EVERY SOUL SHOULD DEFEND ITSELF--SHOULD BE ON ITS GUARD AGAINST FALSEHOOD DECEIT AND MISTAKE AND SHOULD BEWARE OF ALL KINDS OF CONFIDENCE MEN INCLUDING THOSE IN THE PULPIT
ALL STRANGE APPEARANCES IN THE HEAVENS--THE NORTHERN LIGHTS CIRCLES ABOUT THE MOON SUN DOGS FALLING STARS--FILLED OUR INTELLIGENT ANCESTORS WITH TERROR
THEY WERE CHAINED AND FLOGGED STARVED AND KILLED
THE FORM AND MOTION OF EVERY STAR THE CLIMATE OF EVERY WORLD ALL FORMS OF VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL LIFE ALL INSTINCT INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIENCE ALL ASSERTIONS AND DENIALS ALL VICES AND VIRTUES ALL THOUGHTS AND DREAMS ALL HOPES AND FEARS ARE NECESSITIES
I THANK THE DISCOVERERS OF CHLOROFORM AND ETHER THE TWO ANGELS WHO GIVE TO THEIR BELOVED SLEEP AND WRAP THE THROBBING BRAIN IN THE SOFT ROBES OF DREAMS
THAT UNBAPTIZED INFANTS WILL BE LOST
THE FORESTS WERE FILLED WITH MONSTERS AND THE DARKNESS WAS CROWDED WITH GHOSTS DEVILS AND FIENDISH GODS
HE WAS IN MY JUDGMENT THE KEENEST OBSERVER THE BEST JUDGE OF THE MEANING AND VALUE OF A FACT THE GREATEST NATURALIST THE WORLD HAS PRODUCED
WEALTH IS NOT A CRIME
NOTHING IS LOST--NOTHING DESTROYED
IN THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER A MAN BROUGHT HIS SON TO JESUS
OUR DESIRE IS THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING SHALL BE TRUE TO HIMSELF TO HIS IDEAL UNBRIBED BY PROMISES CARELESS OF THREATS
WE ARE GROWING GRANDER AND NOBLER
IF WE THANK HIM FOR LIBERTY THE SLAVE SHOULD RAISE HIS CHAINED HANDS IN WORSHIP AND THANK GOD THAT HE TOILS UNPAID WITH THE LASH UPON HIS NAKED BACK
CLAD IN MIST AND MYTH HIDDEN BY THE DRAPERIES OF GODS DEFORMED INDISTINCT AS FACES IN CLOUDS IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIND AND RECOGNIZE THE FEATURES THE NATURAL FACE OF THE ACTUAL CHRIST
IN A FEW YEARS THE POPULATION WAS DOUBLED AND THE WEALTH QUADRUPLED
ALL THIS IS INFAMOUS
SO THESE DEVILS HATED AND DREADED THE SOUND OF HOLY BELLS THE LIGHT OF SACRED TAPERS AND ABOVE ALL THE EVER-BLESSED CROSS
IF A MAN COULD PUT TOGETHER HYDROGEN OXYGEN AND NITROGEN AND PRODUCE PURE GOLD THAT WOULD BE A MIRACLE IN CHEMISTRY
AS BOTH OF THESE WRITERS WERE INSPIRED AND AS BOTH RECEIVED THEIR INFORMATION FROM GOD THEY OUGHT TO AGREE
FOR I TELL YOU TO-NIGHT A CIVILIZED MAN WILL NEVER WANT ANYTHING FOR LESS THAN IT IS WORTH--A CIVILIZED MAN WHEN HE SELLS A THING WILL NEVER WANT MORE THAN IT IS WORTH--A REALLY AND TRULY CIVILIZED MAN WOULD RATHER BE CHEATED THAN TO CHEAT
THE SPIRITS WERE SLEIGHT-OF-HAND PERFORMERS--NECROMANCERS
THE MORE THEY STUDIED THE MORE THEY DIFFERED
HE HAS BEEN HINDERED AND DELAYED AND DECEIVED BY AUGURS AND PROPHETS--BY POPES AND PRIESTS
IN HIS NAME THE PROGRESS OF MANY NATIONS WAS STAYED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
HE WAS AN ACTUAL PERSON A RIVAL OF GOD AN ENEMY OF MANKIND
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO CONCEIVE OF THE IGNORANCE THE CRUELTY THE SUPERSTITION AND THE MENTAL BLINDNESS OF THAT PERIOD
HE HAD NO REVERENCE FOR THE ANCIENT
HE WAS A NATURAL BELIEVER IN THE SUPERNATURAL AND FINDING HIMSELF BESET BY DANGERS AND EVILS HE SOUGHT IN MANY WAYS THE AID OF UNSEEN POWERS
WOULD THE PURITAN HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD ADOPTED THE RELIGION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS
THAT THERE IS NO HOLY GHOST
IT WAS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED THAT ALL LANGUAGES COULD BE TRACED BACK TO THE HEBREW
DURING THE SAME TIME THE CONDITION OF FRANCE AND INDEED OF ALL EUROPE WAS EVEN WORSE THAN ENGLAND
THEY MUTILATED THEIR BODIES--SCARRED THEIR FLESH AND DESTROYED THEIR MINDS FOR THE SAKE OF HAPPINESS IN ANOTHER WORLD
CAN WE CHANGE WINDS BY SACRIFICE
OF COURSE SUCH QUESTIONS ARE IMPUDENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE NATURAL
WE KNOW HOW THE SEEDS OF SUPERSTITION WERE PLANTED AND WHAT MADE THEM GROW
WHAT GOOD HAS THE CHURCH ACCOMPLISHED
HE KNEW THAT CHRIST WISHED TO MAKE AN ATONEMENT OF BLOOD BY THE SACRIFICE OF HIMSELF
NOW GENERALLY A DAY'S WORK IS NOT LONGER THAN TEN HOURS AND THE TENDENCY IS TO STILL FURTHER DECREASE THE HOURS
WITH A ZEAL AMOUNTING TO ENTHUSIASM WITH A COURAGE THAT WAS HEROIC WITH AN ENERGY THAT NEVER FLAGGED A DETERMINATION THAT BROOKED NO OPPOSITION WITH A FIRMNESS THAT DEFIED TORTURE AND DEATH THIS SUBLIME BAND OF REFORMERS SPRANG TO THE ATTACK
NATURE SEEMS TO CARE NOTHING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL NOTHING FOR THE SPECIES
SO THAT FREQUENTLY THE GODS OF ONE PEOPLE WERE THE DEVILS OF ANOTHER
IN HIS GOSPEL WAS FOUND THE DOGMA OF ETERNAL PAIN AND HIS WORDS ADDED AN INFINITE HORROR TO DEATH
I THANK HOMER AND AESCHYLUS AND I THANK SHAKESPEARE ABOVE THEM ALL
THE WONDER OF THE WATCH SUGGESTED THE WATCHMAKER AND THE WONDER OF THE WATCHMAKER SUGGESTED THE CREATOR AND THE WONDER OF THE CREATOR DEMONSTRATED THAT HE WAS NOT CREATED--BUT WAS UNCAUSED AND ETERNAL
GRANARIES BURSTING AND FAMINE LOOKING INTO THE DOORS OF THE POOR
HE SYMPATHIZED WITH ALL WHO SUFFERED--WITH THE IMPRISONED THE ENSLAVED THE OUTCASTS
THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE IN AN INFINITE GOD AND ALSO IN ETERNAL PUNISHMENT THEN YOU MUST ADMIT THAT EDWARDS AND CALVIN WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
THIS ALL SEEMS TO ME LIKE A HORRIBLE DREAM A NIGHTMARE OF TERROR A HELLISH IMPOSSIBILITY
WHO IS THE MAN OF STRAW
MEN AND WOMEN WHO THINK THAT LIGHT IS THE ENEMY OF VIRTUE THAT PURITY DWELLS IN DARKNESS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO KNOW THEMSELVES AND THE FACTS IN NATURE THAT AFFECT THEIR WELL BEING WILL BE HORRIFIED AT THE THOUGHT OF MAKING INTELLIGENCE THE MASTER OF PASSION
ENGLAND BEGAN TO SPIN FOR THE WORLD COTTON BEGAN TO BE UNIVERSALLY WORN CLEAN SHIRTS BEGAN TO BE SEEN
AND NOW THERE IS ANOTHER TROUBLE
THEY ARE ABSURD AND CRUEL
WE BELIEVE THAT MAHATMAS ASTRAL BODIES MATERIALIZATIONS OF SPIRITS CRYSTAL GAZING SEEING THE FUTURE TELEPATHY MIND READING AND CHRISTIAN SCIENCE ARE ONLY CUNNING FRAUDS THE GENUINENESS OF WHICH IS ESTABLISHED BY THE TESTIMONY OF INCOMPETENT HONEST WITNESSES
IT IS AS IT IS AND IT WILL BE AS IT MUST BE
RELIGION AND RAGS PIETY AND POLLUTION KEPT COMPANY
LIKE THE MOST OF YOU I WAS RAISED AMONG PEOPLE WHO KNEW--WHO WERE CERTAIN
THERE WAS NO OTHER DEVIL TO TEMPT HIM
IT SHOULD BE THE CLUBHOUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY COULD FIND THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS OF THE WORLD
THE DEVIL WAS THE SCAPEGOAT OF JEHOVAH
RELIGION MAKES GOD A MASTER AND MAN HIS SERF
WHAT THERE IS IN THIS WORLD THAT LIVES AND BREATHES WAS PRODUCED HERE
NOTHING IS GREATER NOTHING IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN TO FIND AMID THE ERRORS AND DARKNESS OF THIS LIFE A SHINING TRUTH
HE CANNOT DEPEND UPON THE SUPERNATURAL--UPON AN IMAGINARY FATHER IN THE SKIES
I THANK GRANT FOR HIS VICTORIES AND THE VAST HOST THAT FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT,--FOR THE FREEDOM OF MAN
THEY ARE ABOVE REASON
SUPERSTITION MISTOOK INSANITY FOR INSPIRATION AND THE RAVINGS OF MANIACS FOR PROPHESY FOR THE WISDOM OF GOD
IT WAS A FOREST THEN AND THE LAND WAS COVERED WITH STONES
THAT FROM THE LIPS OF CHRIST DROPPED MANY PEARLS OF KINDNESS--OF LOVE
THINK OF THE MILLIONS WHO WERE DRIVEN TO INSANITY
IF WE WISH TO SAVE THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST MANY OF THE PASSAGES MUST BE THROWN AWAY
TO ME IT SEEMS INFINITELY CRUEL FOR LIFE TO FEED ON LIFE--TO CREATE ANIMALS THAT DEVOUR OTHERS
IF THERE IS ONE LESSON THAT HISTORY FORCES UPON US IN EVERY PAGE IT IS THIS
THE CHANGE OF DAYS INTO EPOCHS WAS CONSIDERED BY THE BELIEVERS OF THE BIBLE AS A GREAT TRIUMPH OVER THE HOSTS OF INFIDELITY
THEY WERE THE FIRST TO PUBLISH PHARMACOPOEIAS AND DISPENSATORIES
VOLTAIRE WHO ATTACKED THE SAVAGERY OF THE LAW THE CRUEL DECISIONS OF VENAL COURTS AND RESCUED VICTIMS FROM THE WHEEL AND RACK
OF WHAT USE HAS CHRISTIANITY BEEN TO MAN
SOME COUNTRIES WERE IN THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY BUT SPAIN GLADLY REMAINED IN THE NIGHT
LUKE SAYS THAT HELI WAS JOSEPH'S FATHER
TO DEVELOP THE BRAIN IS TO CIVILIZE THE WORLD
THEY WERE UNSPIRITUAL ENOUGH TO DESIRE COMFORT HERE
IT SAYS TO EVERY HUMAN BEING THINK FOR YOURSELF
MOST OF THE PRIESTS ARE PRUDES AND PUBLICLY DENOUNCE WHAT THEY SECRETLY ADMIRE AND ENJOY
THAT HE WANTS TO GO THROUGH THIS WORLD PAYING HIS WAY AS HE GOES AND IF HE GETS A LITTLE AHEAD AN EXTRA JOY IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED WITH ANOTHER IF THAT OTHER IS DOING SOMETHING FOR HIMSELF
EVERY ONE LIVES ON ALMS--ON ALMS COLLECTED BY FORCE AND FEAR
THEY REGARDED THE VOLCANOES AS CHIMNEYS
MADE INTELLECTUAL HONESTY A CRIME
WE WANT NO LEADERS--NO FOLLOWERS
LUKE ALSO GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST
I DO NOT PRETEND TO KNOW
BUT TO-DAY NO INTELLIGENT MAN BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF DEVILS--NO INTELLIGENT MAN BELIEVES THAT EVIL SPIRITS CAUSE DISEASE--CONSEQUENTLY NO INTELLIGENT PERSON BELIEVES THAT HOLY BONES OR RAGS SACRED HAIRS OR PIECES OF WOOD CAN DRIVE DISEASE OUT OR IN ANY WAY BRING BACK TO THE PALLID CHEEK THE ROSE OF HEALTH
I ADMIT THAT THE DEVIL OF THE BIBLE IS AN IMPOSSIBLE CONTRADICTION
THOU ART THE HOLY ONE OF GOD CERTAINLY IF THE LITTLE DEVILS KNEW THIS THE DEVIL HIMSELF MUST HAVE HAD LIKE INFORMATION
HERE IS ANOTHER MISTAKE
ACCORDING TO THE CHURCH THE NATURAL DESIRES AMBITIONS AND PASSIONS OF MAN WERE ALL WICKED AND DEPRAVED
IT WOULD SEEM FROM THIS THAT THE SERPENT WAS NOT AT THAT TIME IMMORTAL--THAT THERE WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE A MILEPOST AT WHICH THE LIFE OF THIS SERPENT STOPPED
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT--I DO NOT CARE WHETHER HE HAS THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS
IS IT POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SMALLEST ATOM OF SUBSTANCE
IT DENOUNCED THE TAKING OF INTEREST FOR MONEY
FOR MANY CENTURIES THE CHURCH FILLED THE WORLD WITH DEVILS--WITH MALICIOUS SPIRITS THAT CAUSED STORM AND TEMPEST DISEASE ACCIDENT AND DEATH--THAT FILLED THE NIGHT WITH VISIONS OF DESPAIR
WHAT FACT DID THEY FIND
A DIFFERENCE ABOUT FATE AND FREE WILL
THEN THE CHURCH--MEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST--DENIED HIS BODY BURIAL IN CONSECRATED GROUND
WE KNOW THAT SUBSTANCES ARE ALWAYS TRUE TO THEIR NATURES
THAT YOU MUST LOVE YOUR ENEMIES
THE GREAT THEOLOGIANS AND THE SMALL SCIENTISTS--THOSE WHO HAD MORE COURAGE THAN SENSE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE
AND ALL THAT MAN HAS WROUGHT BECOMES A PART OF NATURE'S SELF FORMING THE LIVES OF THOSE TO BE
TELESCOPES BEGAN TO BE POINTED TOWARD THE STARS
THE INQUISITION WAS FOUNDED ON PURPOSE TO CRUSH OUT EVERY NOBLE ASPIRATION OF THE HEART
WE NEITHER THANK NOR CURSE
BACK OF HEALTH SUNSHINE AND HARVEST WAS A GOOD DEITY
MAN HAS ADVANCED JUST IN THE PROPORTION THAT HE HAS MINGLED THOUGHT WITH HIS WORK JUST IN THE PROPORTION THAT HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS HEAD AND HANDS INTO PARTNERSHIP
ACCORDING TO THAT BOOK THE SUN WAS MADE AFTER THE EARTH WAS CREATED
THESE IDEAS WERE HONESTLY ENTERTAINED BY PROTESTANTS AS WELL AS CATHOLICS--BY LUTHER CALVIN KNOX AND WESLEY
WE SEE NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LEFT-SHOULDER GLANCE AND ANY POSSIBLE EVIL EFFECTS UPON THE ONE WHO SAW THE MOON IN THIS WAY
BY ALL THE GLORIOUS DEAD AND THE COUNTLESS MILLIONS YET TO BE I PRAY I BESEECH I IMPLORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE GOVERNMENT UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF ETERNAL JUSTICE
THE SACRED BOOKS OF ALL THE WORLD ARE WORTHLESS DROSS AND COMMON STONES COMPARED WITH SHAKESPEARE'S GLITTERING GOLD AND GLEAMING GEMS
THEN I THINK OF THE EARTHQUAKE AND FLOOD
IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THE THIRTEEN WILL DIE IN A YEAR
THE FOUR CORNER-STONES OF MY THEORY--VII
HYPOCRISY READS AND MISQUOTES AND CREDULITY ACCEPTS THE QUOTATION
STUDYING ASTRONOMY--GEOLOGY--DENIAL AND EVASION BY THE CLERGY--V
YOU ARE GIVING UP THE DOGMA OF INSPIRATION
WE WASTE NO TIME IN USELESS DREAD IN TREMBLING FEAR
TO KNOW THIS WOULD BE ALL THAT THE HEART COULD BEAR
SO IT IS PERFECTLY APPARENT THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO POSSIBLE PROPRIETY IN INSPIRING THE WRITERS OF KINGS AND THE WRITERS OF CHRONICLES
EITHER ALL THE WORLD MUST BE LOST OR GOD MUST DIE
HE FILLS THEM WITH WANTS AND DESIRES WITH APPETITES AND AMBITIONS--WITH HOPES AND FEARS--WITH LOVE AND HATE
I DO NOT SEE HOW A MAN CAN HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND PASS EVERY DAY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT ENOUGH TO EAT
THAT LANGUAGE WAS SO TO SPEAK A NATURAL GROWTH
THERE IS NO DARKNESS BUT IGNORANCE LET US FLOOD THE WORLD WITH INTELLECTUAL LIGHT
HE HAS BEEN BETRAYED BY SAINTS MISLED BY APOSTLES AND CHRISTS FRIGHTENED BY DEVILS AND GHOSTS--ENSLAVED BY CHIEFS AND KINGS--ROBBED BY ALTARS AND THRONES
IT WILL PUT THOUGHTFUL DOUBT ABOVE THOUGHTLESS FAITH
CHRIST IS JUST AS OLD AS HIS FATHER AND THE FATHER IS JUST AS YOUNG AS HIS SON
IN THE MIDST OF DISASTERS THE MISER WITH TREMBLING HANDS OPENED HIS PURSE
THE HISTORY OF THE BRITONS WRITTEN BY THE ARCHDEACONS OF MONMOUTH AND OXFORD WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR
WITCHCRAFT--NECROMANCERS--WHAT IS A MIRACLE?--THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE--III
THE DEVIL IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH
IF WE DO NOT ADVANCE WE GO BACKWARD
THIS KIND CAN COME FORTH BY NOTHING BUT BY PRAYER AND FASTING IS THERE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE BELIEF OF THE MAN WHO WROTE THIS ACCOUNT
THE BALLOT IS THE POWER
THIS FACE IS A REBUKE A REPRIMAND TO NATURAL JOY
OF WHAT USE ARE THE ORTHODOX MINISTERS
HE WHO DENIES THEM WILL BE PUNISHED WITH ETERNAL PAIN
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THAT HEAVEN WAS THE REWARD FOR BELIEF
THIS SHOWS HIS GOODNESS
IN 1860 THE AVERAGE AMOUNT EARNED BY THE LABORING MEN WORKMEN MECHANICS PER YEAR WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE DOLLARS
THINK OF SENDING SHOT AND SHELL CRASHING THROUGH THE BODIES OF MEN
EVERY CHURCH IN WHICH IT IS TAUGHT IS A PUBLIC CURSE
THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE INTELLIGENT VIRTUOUS AND FREE
WE KNOW THAT SCIENCE HAS GIVEN US ALL WE HAVE OF VALUE
IN THE TWELFTH CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD OF A VERY REMARKABLE CASE
THE HAND IS BURNED AND AFTER THAT THE CHILD KEEPS ITS HAND OUT OF THE FIRE
NATURE INVITES INTO THIS WORLD EVERY BABE THAT IS BORN
WEALTH COMMANDS FLATTERY AND ADULATION
IN JERUSALEM TO THE EXTENT OF HIS POWER SATAN REPAIRED THE WRECK AND RUIN HE HAD WROUGHT IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN
THERE WERE WHITE SLAVES IN ENGLAND AS LATE AS 1574
THINK OF THE MILLIONS TAKEN FROM THE MINES OF CALIFORNIA AUSTRALIA AND AFRICA DURING THE PRESENT CENTURY AND YET THE TOTAL SCARCELY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT COLLECTED BY KING DAVID MORE THAN A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF CHRIST
BENEATH THE GAZE OF THE SCIENTIST THEY VANISHED CONFRONTED BY FACTS THEY DISAPPEARED
MATTHEW SAYS
UNDOUBTEDLY THEY HAVE TREBLED THE HOMES OF THE NATION
WE ARE ALL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY
AND THEN TO ROUSE YOURSELF TO DO ALL USEFUL THINGS TO REACH WITH THOUGHT AND DEED THE IDEAL IN YOUR BRAIN TO GIVE YOUR FANCIES WING THAT THEY LIKE CHEMIST BEES MAY FIND ART'S NECTAR IN THE WEEDS OF COMMON THINGS TO LOOK WITH TRAINED AND STEADY EYES FOR FACTS TO FIND THE SUBTLE THREADS THAT JOIN THE DISTANT WITH THE NOW TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE TO TAKE BURDENS FROM THE WEAK TO DEVELOP THE BRAIN TO DEFEND THE RIGHT TO MAKE A PALACE FOR THE SOUL
HAVE MERCY ON ME MY DAUGHTER IS SORELY VEXED WITH A DEVIL"--BUT HE WOULD NOT ANSWER
THE TRINITY ABSURD AND IDIOTIC CHRIST IS A MYTH OR A MAN
THEN WE WILL HAVE A NATION OF PATRIOTS
BELIEVE OR BE DAMNED NO MATTER HOW UNREASONABLE THE BIBLE MAY APPEAR TO YOU YOU MUST BELIEVE
CERTAINLY THEN SATAN KING OF ALL THE FIENDS KNEW THAT CHRIST WAS DIVINE
THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THE WORLD WILL BE ANXIOUS TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH TO FIND OUT THE CONDITIONS OF HAPPINESS AND TO LIVE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH CONDITIONS
OUR POOR FATHERS KNEW NOTHING OF ANY SCIENCE
THEY PUT A MONSTER--A MASTER--A TYRANT IN THE SKY AND SEEK TO ENSLAVE THEIR FELLOW-MEN
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW LUKE AND MARK CHRIST REMAINED FOR THE MOST PART IN THE COUNTRY SELDOM GOING TO JERUSALEM
THEY HATED AND BELITTLED HUMBOLDT ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST INTELLECTUAL OF THE RACE
IF WE HAVE A THEORY WE MUST HAVE FACTS FOR THE FOUNDATION
THE TEMPLES WERE BUILT IN VAIN AND ALL THE PRAYERS DIED UNANSWERED IN THE HEEDLESS AIR
MOST OF THEIR TIME WAS OCCUPIED IN FIGHTING DEVILS
THERE IS NO DARKNESS BUT IGNORANCE"--FALSE NOTIONS CONCERNING ALL DEPARTMENTS OF LIFE--CHANGED IDEAS ABOUT SCIENCE GOVERNMENT AND MORALS--II
HOMES FOR ALL
THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD WAS CREATED AND PREPARED FOR MAN ANY MORE THAN IT WAS CREATED AND PREPARED FOR INSECTS
THEY BELIEVED THE BIBLE
THAT ALL IDEAS OF RIGHT AND WRONG CAME FROM ABOVE
HAVE WE A TRUE COPY OF THE SEPTUAGINT
TELL THEM THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHO WROTE THE FIVE BOOKS
THE BLIND AND DUMB BOTH SPAKE AND SAW
THE OLD DOGMAS LACK BREADTH AND TENDERNESS
LET ME TELL YOU
THIS OF ITSELF IS ENOUGH
HERE WAS A MAN WHO PLUCKED JOY FROM THE MIRE MADE GODDESSES OF PEASANT GIRLS AND ENTHRONED THE HONEST MAN
EACH OF THESE THREE PERSONS IS GOD
A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE NOW LIVE BETTER THAN THE KING USED TO DO
OTHERS DESPISE ANTIQUITY AND ADMIRE ONLY THE MODERN MERELY BECAUSE IT IS MODERN
PERSONS WERE MADE TO HANDLE RED HOT IRON AND IF IT BURNED THEM THEIR GUILT WAS ESTABLISHED
HE GAVE HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT RELIGION--ABOUT THE BLESSED SCRIPTURES ABOUT THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS TIME
WITHOUT SATAN WITHOUT JUDAS NOT A SINGLE HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE BECOME AN ANGEL OF LIGHT
IT DOES NOT CONSIST IN WORSHIPING THE UNKNOWN OR IN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE INFINITE
IN SOME COUNTRIES PRIESTS LOST POWER BUT NOT IN SPAIN
IN NEARLY EVERY BRAIN IS FOUND SOME CLOUD OF SUPERSTITION
HE NEVER HEARD OF ANY PLACE OF AMUSEMENT NEVER WAS AT A THEATRE OR A CIRCUS
CRIMINALS TRAMPS BEGGARS AND FAILURES ARE INCREASING EVERY DAY
ACCORDING TO ANOTHER HE REMAINED FORTY DAYS AFTER RISING FROM THE DEAD
TO MAKE ECHO ANSWER A QUESTION WOULD BE A MIRACLE
HAVING SPENT MY YOUTH IN READING BOOKS ABOUT RELIGION--ABOUT THE NEW BIRTH"--THE DISOBEDIENCE OF OUR FIRST PARENTS THE ATONEMENT SALVATION BY FAITH THE WICKEDNESS OF PLEASURE THE DEGRADING CONSEQUENCES OF LOVE AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GETTING TO HEAVEN BY BEING HONEST AND GENEROUS AND HAVING BECOME SOMEWHAT WEARY OF THE FRAYED AND RAVELED THOUGHTS YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE MY DELIGHT WHEN I READ THE POEMS OF ROBERT BURNS
THE LIGHT OF REASON WAS IRRADIATING THE WORLD AND FROM THAT LIGHT AS FROM THE APPROACH OF THE SUN THE GHOSTS AND SPECTRES OF SUPERSTITION WRAPPED THEIR SHEETS AROUND THEIR ATTENUATED BODIES AND VANISHED INTO THIN AIR
WHAT WOULD WE THINK OF SUCH A SAVAGE
IT NEVER DID AND NEVER CAN PURCHASE THE HIGHEST HAPPINESS
SO IT IS DECLARED THAT THE FATHER IS GOD AND THE SON GOD AND THE HOLY GHOST GOD AND THAT THESE THREE GODS MAKE ONE GOD
SO IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE MALICIOUS COULD BY CHARM AND SPELL OBTAIN REVENGE THAT THE POOR COULD BE ENRICHED AND THAT THE AMBITIOUS COULD RISE TO PLACE AND POWER
THIS IS NOT TRUE
I THANK PAINE WHOSE GENIUS SOWED THE SEEDS OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE HEARTS OF 76
HIS NAME GAVE COURAGE TO THE MARTYR AND IN THE MIDST OF FIRE WITH SHRIVELING LIPS THE SUFFERER UTTERED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT A MIRACLE WAS EVER WROUGHT
HE SHOULD KNOW THAT THE SUPERNATURAL HAS NOT SUCCORED THE OPPRESSED CLOTHED THE NAKED FED THE HUNGRY SHIELDED THE INNOCENT STAYED THE PESTILENCE OR FREED THE SLAVE
IT IS THEREFORE CERTAIN THAT MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE ADAM LIVED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN INHABITED THE EARTH
IF THERE WERE NO FAMINE NO PESTILENCE NO CYCLONE NO EARTHQUAKE WOULD WE THINK THAT GOD IS NOT GOOD
HE WITHHOLDS THE RAIN AND HIS PUPPETS STARVE
THINGS WERE TO HIM AS THEY APPEARED TO BE
TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY BRUNO ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN THIS WORLD HAS PRODUCED GAVE HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS FELLOW-MEN
HE IT WAS WHO ACCORDING TO THE FAITH BROUGHT IMMORTALITY TO LIGHT AND MANY MILLIONS HAVE ENTERED THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW WITH THEIR HANDS IN HIS
MAN SHOULD CEASE TO EXPECT ANY AID FROM ANY SUPERNATURAL SOURCE
IN SPITE HOWEVER OF THE APPARENT FAILURE HERE A VAST SUM OF MONEY IS EXPENDED EVERY YEAR TO CARRY OUR IDEAS OF THE SUPERNATURAL TO OTHER RACES
IN 1609 KEPLER PUBLISHED HIS BOOK MOTIONS OF THE PLANET MARS HE TOO KNEW OF THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION AND THAT IT ACTED IN PROPORTION TO MASS AND DISTANCE
SO MUCH FOR THAT
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MOHAMMED ORIGINALLY WAS A CARDINAL AND BECAME A HERETIC BECAUSE HE FAILED IN HIS DESIGN OF BEING ELECTED POPE THE SAME GENTLEMAN INFORMS US THAT MOHAMMED HAVING DRANK TO EXCESS FELL DRUNK BY THE ROADSIDE AND IN THAT CONDITION WAS KILLED BY PIGS
ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT THIS SERPENT HAD A CONVERSATION WITH EVE THE FIRST WOMAN
THE BRAIN SWEPT BY THE SIROCCO OF GOD'S CURSE BECOMES A DESERT
OF COURSE IT IS ADMITTED BY CHRISTIANS THAT ALL OTHER RELIGIONS ARE FALSE AND CONSEQUENTLY WE NEED EXAMINE ONLY OUR OWN
MANY OF THESE EMPLOYERS HAVE SOUGHT TO BALANCE THEIR ACCOUNTS BY LEAVING SOMETHING FOR UNIVERSITIES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LIBRARIES DRINKING FOUNTAINS OR TO BUILD MONUMENTS TO DEPARTED GREATNESS
AND YET ACCORDING TO THE THEOLOGIANS THIS IS EXACTLY THE COURSE PURSUED BY GOD
CHRISTIANITY HAS CONTROLLED CHRISTENDOM FOR AT LEAST FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
WHY DID CHRIST SELECT JUDAS AS ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES KNOWING THAT HE WOULD BETRAY HIM
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IDEA THAT LABOR IS THE BASIS OF ALL PROSPERITY AND HAPPINESS IS ANOTHER IDEA OR TRUTH AND THAT IS THAT LABOR IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LABORER AND THE WORLD AT LARGE HAPPY MUST BE FREE
THE INSANE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY DEVILS
THESE THEOLOGICAL COUNTRIES THESE IMAGINED WORLDS HAVE DISAPPEARED
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
YES IT DID
AND WE WILL NEVER MEANLY TRY TO SAVE SOME FAIR AND PLEASING LIE
IT HAS DENOUNCED PRIDE AND LUXURY--ALL THINGS THAT ADORN AND ENRICH LIFE--ALL THE PLEASURES OF SENSE--THE ECSTASIES OF LOVE--THE HAPPINESS OF THE HEARTH--THE CLASP AND KISS OF WIFE AND CHILD
THE SAME GLORIOUS PRINCIPLE WAS ADHERED TO BY MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE WRITERS OF THOSE DAYS
THE CHURCH FILLED THE WORLD WITH FAITH AND CRIME
THEY FASHIONED CLUBS AND RUDE WEAPONS OF STONE WITH WHICH THEY KILLED THE LARGER BEASTS AND NOW AND THEN EACH OTHER
BETTER TO REST III ETERNAL SLEEP THAN TO BE AN ANGEL AND KNOW THAT THE ONES YOU LOVE ARE SUFFERING ETERNAL PAIN
THEY DO NOT THINK IT PROBABLE THAT WHALES WERE INVENTED TO SUPPLY THE ESKIMO WITH BLUBBER OR THAT FLAMES WERE CREATED TO ATTRACT AND DESTROY MOTHS
THE TEACHER THAT ADMINISTERS SUCH PUNISHMENT IS NO MORE TO BLAME THAN THE PARENTS THAT ALLOW IT
TO THEM NOTHING HAD WHAT WE CALL A NATURAL CAUSE
THAT WORD DROVE PITY FROM THE HEARTS OF MEN STAINED COUNTLESS SWORDS WITH BLOOD LIGHTED FAGOTS FORGED CHAINS BUILT DUNGEONS ERECTED SCAFFOLDS AND FILLED THE WORLD WITH POVERTY AND PAIN
PARENTS SHOULD BE MODEST ENOUGH TO BE TRUTHFUL--HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT THEIR IGNORANCE
I GAVE UP THE NEW BECAUSE IT VOUCHED FOR THE TRUTH OF THE OLD
AND SO THROUGH COUNTLESS YEARS OF IGNORANCE AND CRUELTY--OF THOUGHT AND CRIME--OF MURDER AND WORSHIP OF HEROISM SUFFERING AND SELF-DENIAL THE RACE HAS REACHED THE HEIGHTS WHERE NOW WE STAND
HE MUST SUPPLY THE WANTS OF THE BODY--AND FEED THE HUNGER OF THE MIND
CHRIST RODE ON AN ASS BUT NOW ASSES RIDE ON CHRIST NOW THE QUESTIONS ARE FIRST WHETHER THE DEVIL DOES REALLY EXIST
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT EVERYBODY IS AS HE MUST BE
THE FALLING CLOTH COULD NOT HAVE PUT THE VISIT DESIRE IN THE MINDS OF PEOPLE NOT PRESENT AND HOW COULD THE CLOTH PRODUCE THE DESIRE TO VISIT THE PARTICULAR PERSON WHO DROPPED IT
HAVE THESE CRINGINGS AND CRAWLINGS--THESE CRUELTIES AND ABSURDITIES--THIS FAITH AND FOOLISHNESS PLEASED THE GODS
POSSIBLY CERTAIN STONES GIVE GOOD LUCK TO THE WEARER WHILE THE WEARING OF OTHERS BRINGS LOSS AND DEATH
IN FAILURE AS IN SUCCESS
THIS MORE THAN ALL ELSE HAS ENABLED MAN TO IMPROVE HIS CONDITION
THINK OF THE MICROSCOPICAL FORMS OF LIFE CONSTRUCTING THEIR MINUTE HOUSES OF LIME GIVING LIFE TO OTHERS LEAVING THEIR MANSIONS BENEATH THE WAVES AND SO THROUGH COUNTLESS GENERATIONS BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS OF CONTINENTS AND ISLANDS
WHETHER SUCH A BEING AS GOD EXISTS
THEY KNEW WHERE HELL WAS AND THEY COULD ALMOST HEAR THE GROANS AND SMELL THE SULPHUROUS FUMES
IF MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT NO GOD EXISTS
SWEAR NOT NEITHER BY HEAVEN FOR IT IS GOD'S THRONE NOR BY THE EARTH FOR IT IS HIS FOOTSTOOL NEITHER BY JERUSALEM FOR IT IS HIS HOLY CITY THINK NOT THAT I AM COME TO DESTROY THE LAW OR THE PROPHETS I AM NOT COME TO DESTROY BUT TO FULFILL FOR AFTER ALL THESE THINGS CLOTHING FOOD AND DRINK DO THE GENTILES SEEK SO WHEN HE CURED A LEPER HE SAID
HE WAS NOT EDUCATED IN AN HONEST SCHOOL
THEY SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR THE ONES WHOSE LIVES THEY HAVE USED AND WHOSE LABOR HAS BEEN THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR PROSPERITY
I AM AWARE THAT THE SUBJECT CHOSEN BY ME IS ALMOST INFINITE AND THAT IN ITS BROADEST SENSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE PRESENT COMPREHENSION OF MAN
SHALL WE THANK THEM FOR THE HELL THEY MADE HERE
THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY SOME OF THE HIGHEST DIGNITARIES OF THE CHURCH AND BY DIRECTION OF THE KING HIMSELF
TO COMPEL MAN TO DESERT THE STANDARD OF REASON THE CHURCH DOES NOT ENTIRELY RELY ON THE THREAT OF ETERNAL PAIN TO BE ENDURED IN ANOTHER WORLD BUT HOLDS OUT THE REWARD OF EVERLASTING JOY
THIS MAKES THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY 35,840 INSTEAD OF THREE MILLIONS
THEY NOTICED WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY RIVERS AND SEAS
MATTER COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED BEFORE FORCE
THIS DOGMA OF HELL IS THE INFINITE OF SAVAGERY--THE DREAM OF INSANE REVENGE
IT NEVER WAS
IN THE NAME OF RELIGION HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT HUMILITY AND ARROGANCE LOVE AND HATRED FORGIVENESS AND REVENGE
THERE IS ONE THING HOWEVER THAT IS STRANGE INDEED AND THAT IS THAT THE REFORMERS OF THOSE DAYS THE MEN WHO ROSE AGAINST THE HORRID TYRANNY OF THE TIMES THE MOMENT THEY ATTAINED POWER PERSECUTED WITH A ZEAL AND BITTERNESS NEVER EXCELLED
YOU WANT TO DO IT NOT SIMPLY FOR THEIR SAKE BUT FOR YOUR OWN
THE POOR CHILDREN WERE HELPLESS
THIS GOD MUST BE MATERIAL
OF HIS WORLD HE SHOULD BE THE SOVEREIGN AND HIS SOUL SHOULD WEAR THE PURPLE
THEY DO THE BEST THEY CAN TO RETAIN THE RESPECT OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN BY DENYING THEIR IMPRISONMENT AND THEIR IDENTITY
THAT EVIL IS BUT BLESSING IN DISGUISE THAT PAIN MAKES STRONG AND VIRTUOUS MEN--MAKES CHARACTER--WHILE PLEASURE ENFEEBLES AND DEGRADES
THE SUN BECAME AN ARTIST
AFTER ALL MARRIAGE IS A CONTRACT AND THE PARTIES TO THE CONTRACT ARE BOUND TO KEEP ITS PROVISIONS
PHILOSOPHERS DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE HISTORIANS
IN ITS FOLLIES THEY HAVE FOUND THE PROFOUNDEST WISDOM
MECHANICS WERE ONLY ONE DEGREE ABOVE THE FARMER
I SHOW THEM THAT HELL DOES NOT EXIST AND THEY DENOUNCE ME FOR DESTROYING THEIR CONSOLATION
LUKE TELLS US THAT THE DEVIL SAID UNTO CHRIST HAVING SHOWN HIM ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD IN A MOMENT OF TIME
FOR MANY CENTURIES AND BY MANY PEOPLES IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THIS GOD DEMANDED SACRIFICES
BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE OF GOOD SPIRITS OR ANGELS--GOD AND THE DEVIL--WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE BY THE SUPERNATURAL--IV
AND WHY DO I SAY THIS
I HOPE NOT
I HOPE NOT
THESE BOOKS ARE NOT ADDRESSED TO HUMAN REASON
GO THY WAY SHOW THYSELF UNTO THE PRIEST AND OFFER THE GIFT THAT MOSES COMMANDED JESUS SENT HIS DISCIPLES FORTH SAYING
HE WILL NOT BELIEVE MEN BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD OR CONTRADICT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALIVE
THEN THEY KNEW WHERE HEAVEN WAS
THE MINISTER WAS AT HIS BEDSIDE--ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A CHRISTIAN IF HE WAS PREPARED TO DIE
THAT NO GOD CREATED OR GOVERNS THE UNIVERSE
IS IT KNOWN THAT HE GOVERNS THE WORLD
THAT ALL THE BIBLE IS INSPIRED
THAT THE PULPIT WAS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK--THAT THE BLOODHOUND'S BARK WAS ONLY AN ECHO FROM MANY OF THE CHURCHES
THE HOURS OF LABOR HAVE BEEN SHORTENED AND MATERIALLY SHORTENED IN MANY COUNTRIES
HOW DID HE FALL
THEIR BUSINESS WAS TO WAR AGAINST THE DEVAS--THAT IS TO SAY THE GODS--AND AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HUMAN BEINGS
SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO USE ALL THEIR SENSES
THANKED THEIR GOD--A PHANTOM FIEND--THAT LIBERTY HAD BEEN BANISHED FROM THE WORLD THESE SOUVENIRS OF THE DREADFUL PAST THESE HORRORS THAT STILL EXIST THESE FRIGHTFUL FACTS DENY THAT ANY GOD EXISTS WHO HAS THE WILL AND POWER TO GUARD AND BLESS THE HUMAN RACE
THE PRESS IS UNTRAMMELED
BY THESE MEANS WE HAVE CHANGED A HANDFUL OF SAND INTO A TELESCOPE
I READ GIBBON THE GREATEST OF HISTORIANS WHO MARSHALED HIS FACTS AS SKILLFULLY AS CAESAR DID HIS LEGIONS AND I LEARNED THAT CHRISTIANITY IS ONLY A NAME FOR PAGANISM--FOR THE OLD RELIGION SHORN OF ITS BEAUTY--THAT SOME ABSURDITIES HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR OTHERS--THAT SOME GODS HAD BEEN KILLED--A VAST MULTITUDE OF DEVILS CREATED AND THAT HELL HAD BEEN ENLARGED
THERE IS IN THE BANK OF FRANCE AT THE PRESENT TIME 1895 NEARLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SO FAR AS WE KNOW IT IS THE GREATEST AMOUNT THAT WAS EVER GATHERED TOGETHER
BEHOLD MY MOTHER AND MY BRETHREN AND EVERY ONE THAT HATH FORSAKEN HOUSES OR BRETHREN OR SISTERS OR FATHER OR MOTHER OR WIFE OR CHILDREN OR LANDS FOR MY NAME'S SAKE SHALL RECEIVE AN HUNDRED FOLD AND SHALL INHERIT EVERLASTING LIFE HE THAT LOVETH FATHER OR MOTHER MORE THAN ME IS NOT WORTHY OF ME
EVERY ORTHODOX CHURCH PROMISES HEAVEN AND THREATENS HELL AND THESE PROMISES AND THREATS ARE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF ALMS FOR REVENUE
THEY FELL UPON THEIR KNEES AND WITH WHITE LIPS PRAYED THE GOOD GOD TO STAY HIS HAND
AND THE GHOST OF THE PAST THE WISDOM OF AGES ANSWERS
BY ALL THE SUFFERING OF THE PAST
WE ALL KNOW THAT FOR MANY MANY AGES MEN HAVE BEEN SLAVES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT DURING ALL THESE YEARS WOMEN HAVE TO SOME EXTENT BEEN THE SLAVES OF SLAVES
WOE TO THE INHABITERS OF THE EARTH AND OF THE SEA
THE THEOLOGICAL VIEW BEGAN TO LOOK SMALL AND MEAN
THE PHONOGRAPH THAT CATCHES AND RETAINS IN MARKS AND DOTS AND GIVES AGAIN THE ECHOES OF OUR SPEECH
THIS IS A KIND OF PENANCE BECAUSE THE MEN THAT HAVE MADE THIS MONEY FROM THE BRAIN AND MUSCLE OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN HAVE EVER FELT THAT IT WAS NOT QUITE THEIR OWN
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MYSTERIES OF LIFE AND THOUGHT OF FORCE AND SUBSTANCE OF GROWTH AND DECAY OF BIRTH AND DEATH OF JOY AND PAIN OF THE SUFFERINGS OF THE GOOD THE TRIUMPHS OF WRONG THE INTELLIGENT HONEST MAN IS COMPELLED TO SAY
IN THE SUMMER OF YOUTH HE MUST PREPARE FOR THE WINTER OF AGE
THE BIBLE WAS MY FIRST HISTORY THE JEWS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE AND THE EVENTS NARRATED BY MOSES AND THE OTHER INSPIRED WRITERS AND THOSE PREDICTED BY PROPHETS WERE THE ALL IMPORTANT THINGS
HE KNOWS THAT AN OWL DOES NOT HOOT IN THE FULL OF THE MOON BECAUSE A DISTINGUISHED MAN IS ABOUT TO DIE
THESE WEAPONS OF REFORM ARE SUBSTANTIALLY USELESS
THEY WERE SINLESS AND MISERABLE--BUT THEY HAD FAITH--THEY WERE PIOUS AND WRETCHED--BUT THEY WERE LIMPING TOWARDS HEAVEN
WITHOUT SUBSTANCE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO MIND NO WILL NO FORCE IN ANY FORM AND THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NO SUBSTANCE WITHOUT FORCE
IN OTHER WORDS HE WAS A FINE OLD HYPOCRITE
THIS--SAY WHAT YOU WILL AGAINST IT--THIS IS THE BEST GOVERNMENT EVER FOUNDED BY THE HUMAN RACE
HE WHO KNOWS ALL CONCLUSIONS CANNOT THINK
FOR REAL AND VIRTUOUS ENJOYMENT THE GOOD PEOPLE DEPENDED ON REVIVALS
THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE AWAY WITH
THEY DID NOT ASK FOR PURE WATER BUT FOR HOLY WATER
TELL THEM THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHO WROTE JOSHUA OR JUDGES OR RUTH SAMUEL KINGS OR CHRONICLES JOB OR THE PSALMS OR THE SONG OF SOLOMON
THEY WERE RULED BY THAT TERRIBLE TRINITY THE COWL THE SWORD AND CHAIN
YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE INGENUITY OF MAN IS FIRST EXERCISED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF WEAPONS
SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSLAVING THE WORLD
IMMENSE SUFFERING WAS PRODUCED
SHOULD THE MOTHER WHO CLASPS TO HER BREAST AN IDIOT CHILD THANK GOD
SO I BELIEVE IN THE CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE THAT IT SHOULD BE PUBLIC
THAT HERETICS SHOULD BE KILLED
FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAD HEARD READ AND READ THE BIBLE
DID INFINITE GOODNESS FASHION THE WINGS OF THE EAGLES SO THAT THEIR FLEEING PREY COULD BE OVERTAKEN
NO ONE CAN BE REALLY PROSPEROUS UNLESS THOSE WITH WHOM HE LIVES SHARE THE SUNSHINE AND THE JOY
THAT WORD CERTIFIES TO THE SAVAGERY OF PRIMITIVE MAN
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT
BACK OF THIS BELIEF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AND THERE NEVER HAS BEEN
BY SOME ACCIDENT I READ VOLNEY WHO SHOWS THAT ALL RELIGIONS ARE AND HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE SAME WAY--THAT ALL HAD THEIR CHRISTS THEIR APOSTLES MIRACLES AND SACRED BOOKS AND THEN ASKED HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO DECIDE WHICH IS THE TRUE ONE
ACCORDING TO THE BLESSED BIBLE DAVID COLLECTED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS IN SILVER AND FIVE THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD MAKING A TOTAL OF SEVEN THOUSAND MILLION DOLLARS
WERE THESE ANGELS REAL ANGELS OR WERE THEY PERSONIFICATIONS OF GOOD OF COMFORT
THE CHURCH SAID
THE FIRMAMENT INLAID WITH SUNS IS THE DOME OF THE REAL CATHEDRAL
YOU HAVE KILLED THE LITTLE DEVILS AND IN A LITTLE WHILE YOU WILL MURDER THE DEVIL HIMSELF
THERE ARE MANY CURIOUS MISTAKES IN THE WORDS ATTRIBUTED TO CHRIST
THE NATIONS PERISHED
I CUT DOWN THE TREES BURNED THE LOGS PICKED UP THE STONES AND LAID THE WALLS
THEOLOGY LOOKED SMALLER STILL
THE LAW WAS IN SOME OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE THAT IF A MAN'S HOUSE WAS BROKEN INTO BETWEEN SUNSET AND SUNRISE AND THE OWNER KILLED THE INTRUDER IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE
SOME MAY ASK ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE OUR RELIGION AWAY I ANSWER NO--SUPERSTITION IS NOT RELIGION
THIS THEY PROVED BY A BOOK AND TO MAKE THE BOOK EVIDENCE THEY CALLED IT INSPIRED
IT HAS FILLED THE WORLD WITH HATRED WAR AND CRIME WITH THE MALICE OF MEEKNESS AND THE ARROGANCE OF HUMILITY
IX
IX
IX

I MIGHT BE JUST THE SAME WAY MYSELF
THE ANGEL THAT STOPPED THE DONKEY OF BALAAM THE ONE WHO WALKED IN THE FURNACE FLAMES WITH MESHECH SHADRACK AND ABED-NEGO THE ONE WHO SLEW THE ASSYRIANS AND THE ONE WHO IN A DREAM REMOVED THE SUSPICIONS OF JOSEPH WERE ALL CREATED BY THE IMAGINATION OF THE CREDULOUS BY THE LOVERS OF THE MARVELOUS AND THEY HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM DOTAGE TO INFANCY FROM IGNORANCE TO IGNORANCE THROUGH ALL THE YEARS
IS NOT THIS UNTHINKABLE GOD A GUESS AN INFERENCE
THERE IS NO SENSE IN SACRIFICE NEVER WAS AND NEVER WILL BE
POSSIBLY DEVILS TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BODIES AND MINDS OF MEN
AWAY FROM ORTHODOX SUNDAY SCHOOLS
IF I CAST OUT DEVILS BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD THEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS COME UNTO YOU IF HE MEANT ANYTHING BY THESE WORDS HE CERTAINLY INTENDED TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT WHAT HE DID DEMONSTRATED THE SUPERIORITY OF GOD OVER THE DEVIL
WAS THIS DEVIL A REAL BEING
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DISPOSITIONS ANY MORE THAN FOR THEIR HEIGHT
WE GET ALL OUR FACTS FROM THOSE WHO COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN
INVESTIGATION IS AN INFINITE DANGER UNBELIEF IS AN INFINITE OFFENCE AND DESERVES AND WILL RECEIVE INFINITE PUNISHMENT
THE MARTYRDOM OF MAN--HOW IS TRUTH TO BE FOUND--EVERY MAN SHOULD BE MENTALLY HONEST--HE SHOULD BE INTELLECTUALLY HOSPITABLE--GEOLOGISTS CHEMISTS MECHANICS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN ARE SEEKING FOR THE TRUTH--II
I HEAR THE RICH MAN'S VOICE
I SEE THE ROMANS KNEELING TO A HUNDRED GODS
THEY WERE INFINITELY CRUEL THEIR PREMISES INFINITELY ABSURD THEIR GOD INFINITELY FIENDISH AND THEIR LOGIC PERFECT
HUMAN TESTIMONY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH A MIRACLE
THERE IS NO GREAT DIMINUTION IN CRIME
THEY KNEW THAT MANY CENTURIES AGO GOD HAD LEFT HIS THRONE AND HAD BEEN BORN A BABE INTO THIS POOR WORLD--THAT HE HAD SUFFERED DEATH FOR THE SAKE OF MAN--FOR THE SAKE OF SAVING A FEW
BUT IF ALL COULD UNITE THEY COULD OBTAIN WHAT IS REASONABLE WHAT IS JUST AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE SYMPATHY OF A VERY LARGE MAJORITY OF THEIR FELLOW-MEN PROVIDED THEY WERE REASONABLE
NATURE HAS NO DESIGN NO INTELLIGENCE
DURING HIS TIME IT RAINED BLOOD FOR THREE DAYS
IN THE DARKNESS OF LIFE THERE ARE A FEW GLEAMS OF LIGHT
AND WHAT IS THE RESULT
HOW THESE STONES AFFECT THE FUTURE HOW THEY DESTROY CAUSES AND DEFEAT EFFECTS NO ONE PRETENDS TO KNOW
IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN WE ARE TOLD THAT JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID THAT HE SAW THE SPIRIT DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN LIKE A DOVE AND THAT IT ABODE UPON CHRIST
IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER CURSES THE SERPENT WAS CURSED--CONDEMNED TO CRAWL ON HIS BELLY AND TO EAT DUST
LET US ABOVE ALL THINGS GET ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER
THEY ACCEPT WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE TO BE TRUE
THE MAN WHO CANNOT THINK IS LESS THAN MAN
WE HAVE NO FEAR OF DEVILS GHOSTS OR HELLS
ACCORDING TO PAUL JESUS APPEARED TO JUDAS WITH THE REST
WERE ALL THE ANGELS DESCRIBED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IMAGINARY SHADOWS--BODILESS PERSONIFICATIONS
TO BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL
THE POOR ARE IN THE MAJORITY IN THIS COUNTRY
DURING ALL THESE YEARS MY WIFE NEVER HAD A GOOD DRESS OR A DECENT BONNET
SO ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT THE FORCES THE FACTS IN NATURE CANNOT BE CONTROLLED OR CHANGED BY PRAYER OR PRAISE BY SUPPLICATION CEREMONY OR SACRIFICE
SO OUR IDEAS OF MORALITY HAVE CHANGED AND MILLIONS NOW BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER PRODUCES HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING IS IN THE HIGHEST SENSE MORAL
THEY ABHOR ALL WORKS OF FICTION AND LOVE THE BIBLE
THAT WORD IS THE ASSASSIN OF JOY THE MOCKING MURDERER OF HOPE
VI

KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE DEFEATED AND CAST OUT
EACH MIND HAS THE RIGHT TO LIFT ALL CURTAINS WITHDRAW ALL VEILS SCALE ALL WALLS EXPLORE ALL RECESSES ALL HEIGHTS ALL DEPTHS FOR ITSELF IN SPITE OF CHURCH OR PRIEST OR CREED OR BOOK
WILT THOU BE MADE WHOLE THE IMPOTENT MAN ANSWERED HIM
XI
THIS BELIEF IN AMULETS AND CHARMS IN GHOSTS AND DEVILS IS SUPERSTITION PURE AND SIMPLE
HE INVENTED THE TELESCOPE
THESE THINKERS WITHDREW THEIR GAZE FROM THE SKIES AND LOOKED AT THEIR OWN SURROUNDINGS
I FOUND THAT THE WRITER OF THE INSPIRED BOOK HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ASTRONOMY--THAT HE WAS AS IGNORANT AS A CHOCTAW CHIEF--AS AN ESKIMO DRIVER OF DOGS
THEY HAVE TAUGHT THEM THE SLAVE VIRTUES--MEEKNESS HUMILITY--IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE
HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY SUN DOGS OR THE MORNING OF THE NORTH WHEN THE GLITTERING LANCES PIERCE THE SHIELD OF NIGHT
IF THE ANGELS OF THE BIBLE ARE REAL ANGELS THE DEVILS ARE REAL DEVILS
THE ONLY MARTYR WHO HAD NO HEAVEN TO GAIN NO HELL TO SHUN NO GOD TO PLEASE
THEY ARE TRYING TO PRESERVE THE SACREDNESS OF THE SABBATH
SHOULD THE SLAVE THANK GOD
NO REASONS ARE GIVEN--NO FACTS--NO EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED--NOTHING BUT ASSERTION
I CANNOT DO MUCH BUT I CAN AT LEAST SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE WHO SUFFER
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SOME OF THESE DEVILS WERE MADE OUT OF DEGRADED GODS AND NATURALLY ENOUGH MANY DEVILS WERE MADE OUT OF THE GODS OF OTHER NATIONS
THE NEW TESTAMENT BUT WE HAVE THE NEW TESTAMENT THE SEQUEL OF THE OLD IN WHICH CHRISTIANS FIND THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECIES MADE BY INSPIRED JEWS
PRODUCED BY DAVID WIDGER THE WORKS OF ROBERT G
IF THEY WOULD FOREGO THE PLEASURES OF LARCENY AND MURDER
THEY WERE SATISFIED THAT SOME GREAT EVIL WAS COMING UPON MANKIND
PRINTING READING AND WRITING WERE CRIMES
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS STORY THE DEVIL OUTWITTED HIMSELF
AND THE GREAT DRAGON WAS CAST OUT THAT OLD SERPENT CALLED THE DEVIL AND SATAN WHICH DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD
IN ORDER TO SHOW YOU THAT THE MOST ABJECT SUPERSTITION PERVADED EVERY DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE OR OF IGNORANCE RATHER ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU A FEW OF THEIR IDEAS UPON LANGUAGE
WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE NATIVES OF THIS WORLD PRODUCED HERE AND THAT THEIR LIFE DID NOT COME FROM THE BREATH OF ANY GOD
THIS IS THE BLOOD OF OUR GOD THE EGYPTIANS HAD A TRINITY
THIS CHANGE TO ANIMAL FORM WAS EXCEEDINGLY COMMON
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BEGAN TO GET ACQUAINTED
IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER A GREEK WOMAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS POSSESSED BY A DEVIL BESOUGHT CHRIST TO CAST THIS DEVIL OUT
IF WE HAD BEEN BORN IN CONSTANTINOPLE THE MOST OF US WOULD HAVE SAID
HE ADMITS THAT HE DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THE UNKNOWN IS GOOD OR BAD--WHETHER HE OR IT WANTS OR WHETHER HE OR IT IS WORTHY OF WORSHIP
THE THEOLOGIAN SAYS THAT GOD ARMORED THE HIPPOPOTAMUS COVERED HIS BODY EXCEPT THE UNDER PART WITH SCALES AND PLATES THAT OTHER ANIMALS COULD NOT PIERCE WITH TOOTH OR TUSK
ALL THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE THESE CHRISTIAN SAVAGES BELIEVED IN THE DOGMA OF ETERNAL PAIN
I THANK THE STATESMEN WHO HAVE PRESERVED THE RIGHTS OF MAN
ACCORDING TO LUKE THEY ALL WENT TO JERUSALEM AND FROM THERE BACK TO NAZARETH
THESE FRIGHTFUL THINGS ARE A PART OF CHRISTIANITY
SUPERSTITION IS THE CHILD OF IGNORANCE AND THE MOTHER OF MISERY
LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD BY THESE MEN THAT THERE IS NO REVENGE
LET US SAY TO OUR CHILDREN
THE BEST MEN SHOULD HAVE CHARGE OF PRISONS
THE NEXT QUESTION IS
MATTHEW BEING DULY INSPIRED SAYS THAT WHEN JUDAS SAW THAT JESUS HAD BEEN CONDEMNED HE REPENTED AND TOOK BACK THE MONEY TO THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ELDERS SAYING THAT HE HAD SINNED IN BETRAYING THE INNOCENT BLOOD
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE HAS AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
OUR FATHERS BELIEVED IN MIRACLES IN SIGNS AND WONDERS ECLIPSES AND COMETS IN THE VIRTUES OF BONES AND IN THE POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO EVIL SPIRITS
IS THE WORLD FOREVER TO REMAIN AS IT WAS WHEN LEAR MADE HIS PRAYER
I PROPOSE TO SAY A FEW WORDS UPON SUBJECTS THAT ARE NEAR TO US ALL AND IN WHICH EVERY HUMAN BEING OUGHT TO BE INTERESTED--AND IF HE IS NOT IT MAY BE THAT HIS WIFE WILL BE IT MAY BE THAT HIS ORPHANS WILL BE
EVERYTHING ASSUMED THE AIR OF THE MIRACULOUS
IN THE SAME CHAPTER JOHN TELLS CHRIST THAT HE SAW ONE CASTING OUT DEVILS IN CHRIST'S NAME WHO DID NOT FOLLOW WITH THEM AND JESUS SAID
THE POOR KNOW NOTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE PART EXCEPT THE OUTSIDE SPLENDOR
THEIR FELLOW-MEN ASSISTED THEM
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHAT CAN THOUGHT BE WORTH
I SEE THEM WITH THEIR FACES IN THE DUST IN THE DARK DAYS OF PLAGUE AND SUDDEN DEATH WHEN CHEEKS ARE WAN AND LIPS ARE WHITE FOR LACK OF BREAD
THEY RUN ALL THE CARS
SLAVERY HAS BEEN ABOLISHED BUT PROGRESS REQUIRES MORE
HAS HE INGENUITY ENOUGH TO FRAME AN EXCUSE FOR THE CREATION OF THE DEVIL
IT IS FEAR
THE ENERGIES OF CHRISTENDOM WERE WASTED IN THE VAIN EFFORT TO OBTAIN ASSISTANCE FROM THE SUPERNATURAL
THEY HAVE BEEN MISLED BY OTHERS
THE OLDEST PRETENDED COPY WE HAVE OF THE SEPTUAGINT WRITTEN IN GREEK WAS MADE IN THE 5TH CENTURY AFTER CHRIST
IN THOSE DAYS PUBLIC PUNISHMENTS WERE ALL BRUTAL
THERE IS NOT A THEOLOGIAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO CAN PRODUCE THE SLIGHTEST THE LEAST PARTICLE OF EVIDENCE TENDING TO SHOW THAT THE BIBLE IS THE INSPIRED WORD OF GOD
SCHOOLS IN WHICH LIES WERE SACRED AND TRUTHS PROFANE
SECOND WHETHER THE SACRED SCRIPTURES TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL AND OF UNCLEAN SPIRITS AND THIRD WHETHER THIS BELIEF IN DEVILS IS A NECESSARY PART OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY NOW WHERE DID THE IDEA THAT A DEVIL EXISTS COME FROM
THE MORE HOMES THE BROADER THE FOUNDATION OF THE NATION AND THE MORE SECURE
HE WAS NOT AWED BY PAGEANTRY AND POMP BY CROWNED CRIME OR MITERED PRETENCE
MATTER AND FORCE IN THEIR COUNTLESS FORMS AFFINITIES AND REPULSIONS PRODUCED THE LIVING BREATHING WORLD
HE KNOWS THAT COMETS AND ECLIPSES WOULD COME IF ALL THE FOLKS WERE DEAD
THE GOVERNOR SAYS
WHOSE IMAGINATION READ THE TEAR-BLURRED RECORDS THE BLOOD-STAINED PAGES OF ALL THE PAST AND SAW FALLING ATHWART THE OUTSPREAD SCROLL THE LIGHT OF HOPE AND LOVE
WE ARE TOLD THAT CHRIST WAS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY DAYS TEMPTED OF SATAN AND WAS WITH THE WILD BEASTS AND THAT THE ANGELS MINISTERED UNTO HIM
MUST WE BELIEVE IN THE STAR AND THE WISE MEN
AND HE LAID HOLD ON THE DRAGON--THAT OLD SERPENT WHICH IS THE DEVIL AND SATAN--AND BOUND HIM A THOUSAND YEARS
IT IS NOT MEET TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND CAST IT UNTO DOGS YET FOR HER FAITH HE CURED HER CHILD
BUT WE HAVE NO MORE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOOD SPIRITS THAN OF BAD
FORBID HIM NOT BY THIS HE SEEMED TO ADMIT THAT SOME ONE NOT A FOLLOWER OF HIS WAS CASTING OUT DEVILS IN HIS NAME AND HE WAS WILLING THAT HE SHOULD GO ON BECAUSE AS HE SAID
GO NOT INTO THE WAY OF THE GENTILES AND INTO ANY CITY OF THE SAMARITANS ENTER YE NOT BUT GO RATHER TO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL A WOMAN CAME OUT OF CANAAN AND CRIED TO JESUS
I LOVE TO SEE A LOG HOUSE
IT MADE THE CRADLE AS TERRIBLE AS THE COFFIN
WHAT HE WAS HE IS
IF WE CAN EVER GET THE LOVING POOR ACQUAINTED WITH THE SYMPATHIZING RICH THIS QUESTION WILL BE NEARLY SOLVED
THERE THE POOREST IS THE EQUAL OF THE RICHEST
THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THEIR CONCLUSIONS IF YOU ADMIT THEIR PREMISES
THE PRISONS JAILS POORHOUSES AND ASYLUMS ARE CROWDED
BUT THIS IS GENERALLY SO GRADUAL THAT THE DEPARTURE IS SCARCELY NOTICED AND THOSE WHO CHANGE USUALLY INSIST THAT THEY ARE STILL FOLLOWING THE FATHERS
THE LAST PHASE OF THIS BELIEF IN SACRIFICE WAS ACCORDING TO THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT GOD ACCEPTED THE BLOOD OF HIS SON AND THAT AFTER HIS SON HAD BEEN MURDERED HE GOD WAS SATISFIED AND WANTED NO MORE BLOOD
GREAT IS THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS DID THEY SHOW US HOW TO IMPROVE OUR CONDITION IN THIS WORLD
BUT IT IS WELL TO KNOW THAT WE ARE INDEBTED TO THE MOORS--TO THE FOLLOWERS OF MOHAMMED--FOR HAVING LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN SCIENCE
WAS THIS SPIRIT WHO CLAIMED TO BE THE FATHER OF CHRIST A REAL BEING OR WAS HE A PERSONIFICATION
SHE TELLS THIS TO HER CHILDREN AND THEY BELIEVE
IT IS WELL TO PUT A COFFIN WHERE IT CAN BE SEEN FROM THE CRADLE
HE LOVED THE CREDULOUS--THOSE WHO BELIEVED WITHOUT EVIDENCE--AND FOR THEM HE PREPARED A HOME IN THE REALM OF FADELESS LIGHT
THE POEMS OF ROBERT BURNS--BYRON SHELLEY KEATS AND SHAKESPEARE--VI
THEY WERE REGARDED AS THE HOMES--AS THE TENEMENT-HOUSES OF DEVILS
IF THIS GOD EXISTS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HE IS-I GOOD
THAT THERE IS NO MAGIC NO MIRACLE
1898 I
AND NEITHER SHOULD BE RELEASED FROM SUCH A CONTRACT UNLESS IN SOME WAY THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ARE INVOLVED
THE SMALLEST SEED THAT WRAPPED IN SOIL HAS DREAMS OF APRIL RAINS AND DAYS OF JUNE WITHHOLDS ITS SECRET FROM THE WISEST MEN
IN ALL AGES MOST PRIESTS HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS AND RELENTLESS
I AM NOT SENT BUT UNTO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL THEN THE WOMAN WORSHIPED HIM AND SAID
THE WOMEN HALF NAKED WOULD CHANT SOME WILD MEASURE WHILE THE MEN WOULD BRANDISH THEIR DIRKS AND DANCE
GOD IS GOOD AND HE GIVES YOU THE LIBERTY TO CHOOSE THE POPES AND THE PRIESTS SAY TO THE POOR PEOPLE
DURING ALL THESE AGES THE BRAIN OF MAN WAS BEING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY DEVELOPED
THERE IS ANOTHER DIRECTION IN WHICH THE WEALTH AND ENERGIES OF MAN ARE WASTED
AT BASLE IN 1474 A ROOSTER WAS TRIED CHARGED WITH HAVING LAID AN EGG AND AS ROOSTER EGGS WERE USED ONLY IN MAKING WITCH OINTMENT IT WAS A SERIOUS CHARGE AND EVERYONE OF COURSE ADMITTED THAT THE DEVIL MUST HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE AS ROOSTERS COULD NOT VERY WELL LAY EGGS WITHOUT SOME HELP
AND IT DID ALL THIS TO PRESERVE WHAT IT CALLED THE TRUTH--TO DESTROY HERESY AND DOUBT AND TO SAVE IF POSSIBLE THE SOULS OF A FEW
IT WILL NOT DO TO SAY THAT CERTAIN IDEAS ARE SACRED AND THAT MAN HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO INVESTIGATE AND TEST THESE IDEAS FOR HIMSELF
THERE IS NOT IN ALL THE PULPITS INGENUITY ENOUGH TO HARMONIZE THESE IGNORANT AND STUPID CONTRADICTIONS
HE WILL NOT ACCEPT BETTER DOCTRINES UNTIL HE GETS BETTER CLOTHES AND HE WON'T HAVE MORE FAITH TILL HE GETS MORE FOOD
CERTAINLY THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE BIRTH OF CHRIST
THE EARTH WAS KNOWN TO BE ROUND
CERTAINLY I DO NOT AGREE WITH HIM
IN THEIR MINDS THE DEVIL HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT
WHETHER ANY SACRIFICE OF BABE OR OX SECURED THE FAVOR OF THIS UNSEEN GOD
LET US LIVE FREE LIVES
ALL THESE BLESSED THINGS THEY KNEW
NOW WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE HORRORS WERE THE RESULT OF SUPERSTITION
ON THE 28TH DAY OF AUGUST 1833 ENGLAND ABOLISHED SLAVERY THROUGHOUT THE BRITISH COLONIES THUS GIVING LIBERTY TO NEARLY ONE MILLION SLAVES
WE OBTAIN OUR DEVIL FROM THE JEWS AND THEY GOT HIM FROM BABYLON
HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE
DID INFINITE GOODNESS CREATE THE COUNTLESS WORTHLESS LIVING THINGS THAT BREED WITHIN AND FEED UPON THE FLESH OF HIGHER FORMS
THEN HEROD FINDING THAT HE WAS MOCKED BY THE WISE MEN SENT FORTH AND SLEW ALL THE CHILDREN THAT WERE IN BETHLEHEM AND IN ALL THE COASTS THEREOF FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UNDER AFTER THE DEATH OF HEROD AN ANGEL AGAIN APPEARED IN A DREAM TO JOSEPH AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE MOTHER AND CHILD AND GO BACK TO PALESTINE
THE NEXT THING WAS TO FIND SOME POWER TO ASSIST HIM--THAT IS TO SAY THE WEIGHT OF FALLING WATER OR THE FORCE OF THE WIND
IT PRETENDED TO HAVE A REVELATION FROM GOD
THAT THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATION WILL ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME
IF YOU GIVE WAY OR HEDGE ASIDE FROM THE DIRECT FORTHRIGHT LIKE TO AN ENTERED TIDE THEY ALL RUSH BY AND LEAVE YOU HINDMOST OR LIKE A GALLANT HORSE FALLEN IN FIRST RANK LIE THERE FOR PAVEMENT TO THE ABJECT REAR THE STRUGGLE IS SO HARD
ON EVERY HAND THEY SOW THE SEEDS OF SUPERSTITION
BACK OF THE EVIL A DEVIL
HE ENJOYS THE TRAGEDIES--THE DESPERATION--THE DESPAIR--THE SUICIDES
MILLIONS OF EVERYTHING AND YET MILLIONS WANTING EVERYTHING AND HAVING SUBSTANTIALLY NOTHING
THE CHURCH MUST ADMIT THAT THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WERE UNINSPIRED MEN--THAT THEY MADE MANY MISTAKES THAT THEY ACCEPTED IMPOSSIBLE LEGENDS AS HISTORICAL FACTS THAT THEY WERE IGNORANT AND SUPERSTITIOUS THAT THEY PUT MALEVOLENT STUPID INSANE AND UNWORTHY WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF CHRIST DESCRIBED HIM AS THE WORKER OF IMPOSSIBLE MIRACLES AND IN MANY WAYS STAINED AND BELITTLED HIS CHARACTER
WHOEVER HAS A REVELATION FROM GOD WILL DEFEND IT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH--WILL ABHOR REASON AND DENY FACTS
THERE WERE THIRTY-FOUR COUNTIES WITHOUT A PRINTER
FROM THAT DAY I HAVE PASSIONATELY HATED EVERY ORTHODOX CREED
AND JUST EXACTLY AS WE HAVE RISEN IN THE SCALE OF BEING THE PER CENT OF FAILURES HAS INCREASED
EACH MAN IN THE LABORATORY OF HIS OWN MIND AND FOR HIMSELF ALONE SHOULD TEST THE SO-CALLED FACTS--THE THEORIES OF ALL THE WORLD
HE DISCOVERS THE BEST MATERIAL TO BE USED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION
AT THE SAME TIME THEY KNEW THAT GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS WORK
IT ENABLES US TO KEEP THE HIGHWAY TO AVOID THE OBSTRUCTIONS AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FORCES OF NATURE
ALL THESE MISTAKES AND ILLUSIONS AND DELUSIONS--ALL THESE MIRACLES AND MYTHS MUST FADE FROM THE MINDS OF INTELLIGENT MEN
THEY BEGAN TO SEEK FOR CAUSES FOR THE EXPLANATIONS OF PHENOMENA
BETTER LOSE ALL ART ALL INVENTIONS THAN TO LOSE LIBERTY
I THANK THE GREAT SCULPTORS
ANOTHER MAN GOES TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAYS THAT HE IS WILLING TO DIE IN PLACE OF THE MURDERER
SO THEIR HANDS AND FEET WERE TIED AND THEY WERE THROWN INTO THE WATER AND IF THEY SANK THEY WERE PRONOUNCED GUILTY AND ALLOWED TO DROWN
DID IT ACCOMPLISH THIS RESULT THROUGH THE INQUISITION--BY THE USE OF THE THUMB-SCREW THE RACK AND THE FAGOT
IT APPEALS TO THE SENSES--TO THE JUDGMENT THE REASON TO ALL THE HIGHER AND NOBLER FACULTIES AND POWERS OF THE MIND
I SEE THE DYING VICTIMS THE SMOKING ALTARS THE SWINGING CENSERS AND THE RISING CLOUDS
THERE IS NO DARKNESS BUT IGNORANCE EVERY HUMAN BEING IS A NECESSARY PRODUCT OF CONDITIONS AND EVERY ONE IS BORN WITH DEFECTS FOR WHICH HE CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
FEAR BENDS THE KNEES AND UTTERS THE PRAYER
THEY REGARD THEM BOTH AS BROKEN DOLLS FROM THE NURSERY OF THE PAST
I ADMIT AND CHEERFULLY ADMIT THAT THE BELIEVERS IN THE SUPERNATURAL HAVE DONE SOME GOOD--NOT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IN GODS AND DEVILS--BUT IN SPITE OF IT
KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE PRIEST OR HE WILL MAKE THEM THE ENEMIES OF MANKIND IN EVERY ORTHODOX SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN DEVILS
IT WILL ANSWER MY PRESENT PURPOSE TO COMMENCE WITH THE MIDDLE AGES
ALL WORLDLY DESIRES WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HEARTS
WE DO NOT KNOW
WE DO NOT KNOW
WE DO NOT KNOW
WE DO NOT KNOW
IS THE WITHERED PALM TO BE ALWAYS EXTENDED IMPLORING FROM THE STONY HEART OF RESPECTABLE CHARITY ALMS
I HAVE OWNED A GREAT DEAL OF LAND BUT I KNOW JUST AS WELL AS I KNOW I AM LIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO HAVE IT UNLESS I USE IT
LUKE NEVER HEARD OF THE WISE MEN NOR MATTHEW OF THE SHEPHERDS
IS IT BEING USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND
AND WE CAN STAND ERECT AND DARE ALL THINGS ALL FACTS THAT REALLY ARE
THE MAN WHO GIVES MONEY TO A JUDGE OR JUROR FOR A DECISION OR VERDICT IS GUILTY OF A CRIME
THE HOME IS THE UNIT OF THE NATION
HE HAS SLANDERED AND MALIGNED HIMSELF
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS MIND
I THANK THE POETS OF THE DAWN--THE TELLERS OF LEGENDS--THE MAKERS OF MYTHS--THE SINGERS OF JOY AND GRIEF OF HOPE AND LOVE
AND SO THERE IS A CONTINUAL THOUGH ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHANGE
THEIR FACES WERE ASHEN WITH FEAR AS THEY CLOSED THEIR EYES AND CRIED TO THE HEAVENS FOR HELP
THEY GAVE US PREDESTINATION FOREORDINATION AND JUST ENOUGH FREE WILL TO GO TO HELL
TELEGRAPHS AND CABLES WERE INVENTED
THEY HAVE BECOME DREAMS--VANISHED VISIONS
NEVER HAS THE CHURCH TOLD OR TRIED TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT AN HONEST FOE
THERE WERE CENTURIES OF DARKNESS WHEN RELIGION HAD CONTROL OF CHRISTENDOM
JESUS I KNOW AND PAUL I KNOW BUT WHO ARE YE AND THE MAN IN WHOM THE EVIL SPIRIT WAS LEAPED ON THEM SO THAT THEY FLED NAKED AND WOUNDED PAUL WRITING TO THE CORINTHIANS IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER SAYS
THEY HAVE FOUND THE QUALITIES OF SUBSTANCES THE NATURE OF THINGS--HOW TO ANALYZE SEPARATE AND COMBINE AND HAVE ENABLED US TO USE THE GOOD AND AVOID THE HURTFUL
POSSIBLY JOHN NEVER HEARD OF THAT OR FORGOT IT OR DID NOT BELIEVE IT
THE MYSTERY OF EXISTENCE CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THE INTELLECT OF MAN
IN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES THAT DOES HAVE A SOFTENING INFLUENCE UPON THE RICH AND UPON THE POOR
HE FEELS CERTAIN THAT IMPS GOBLINS DEMONS AND EVIL SPIRITS EXIST ONLY IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE IGNORANT AND FRIGHTENED
AND YET WHILE THE TRUE CHRISTIANS THE MEN SELECTED BY THE TRUE GOD AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST WERE TEARING OUT THE TONGUES OF HERETICS THESE WRETCHES WERE IRREVERENTLY TRACING THE ORBITS OF THE STARS
WE RELY UPON FACTS
THEY COULD SAY TO THIS MINISTER
ON EVERY HAND THERE SEEMS TO BE DESIGN TO DEFEAT DESIGN
TO THROW AWAY YOUR REASON AT THE COMMAND OF CHURCHES POPES PARTIES KINGS OR GODS IS TO BE A SERF A SLAVE
HE SHOULD USE ALL HIS SENSES
THE LABORING MAN PAYS ALL THE EXPENSES
AND BEING AT THE TIME OF HIS DISCHARGE PAID A REASONABLE PRICE FOR HIS LABOR
LET HIM TAKE BACK HIS SLANDER MAKE ALL THE REPARATION THAT HE CAN AND LET THE OX ALONE
NOW THE LAND BELONGS TO THE CHILDREN OF NATURE
IF THE DEVIL DOES NOT EXIST THE BIBLE IS NOT TRUE
THEY ALSO ASSERTED THAT ALL THE FORMS OF VEGETATION FROM MOSSES TO FORESTS WERE JUST THE SAME TO-DAY AS THE MOMENT THEY WERE MADE
TEACH YOUR CHILDREN THAT THE FIRESIDE IS THE HAPPIEST PLACE IN THIS WORLD
MOST PEOPLE WHO THINK HAVE GIVEN UP A PERSONAL GOD A CREATIVE DEITY
THESE GOOD SPIRITS WOULD TURN ASIDE THE SWORD AND ARROW FROM THE BREAST OF THE FAITHFUL
1899 I
1899 I
TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF EVIL SPIRITS IS TO UTTERLY DESTROY THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY
NOW CAN WE SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE POSSESSED WITH PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL AND THAT THESE PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL WERE CAST OUT
THAT MONEY WILL FILL HIS HEART WITH FEAR
WANT RAGS CRUSTS FAILURE MISFORTUNE--ALL THESE AWAKE THE WILD BEAST IN MAN AND FINALLY HE TAKES AND TAKES CONTRARY TO LAW AND BECOMES A CRIMINAL
TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE RELIGION IS IMPOSSIBLE
BELIEVING THAT ANIMALS WERE ALSO TAKEN POSSESSION OF BY EVIL SPIRITS AND ALSO BELIEVING THAT IF THEY KILLED AN ANIMAL CONTAINING ONE OF THE EVIL SPIRITS THAT THEY CAUSED THE DEATH OF THE SPIRIT THEY ABSOLUTELY TRIED ANIMALS CONVICTED AND EXECUTED THEM
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS I WOULD ALLOW THE SALE OF THIS HOMESTEAD AND EXEMPT THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE FOR A CERTAIN TIME DURING WHICH THEY MIGHT BE INVESTED IN ANOTHER HOME
IS THERE ANY ALLEGORY OR POETRY OR MYTH IN THIS STORY
FOR THEIR BIBLE THEY ASK THE PROTECTION OF LAW
WHAT IS THAT TO US
THE MORALS OF THE PEOPLE CORRESPONDED AS THEY GENERALLY DO TO THEIR PHYSICAL CONDITION
HERE AGAIN THERE IS MADE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SICK AND THOSE POSSESSED BY DEVILS
THE ONE ASKS
ITS VALUE IS ABSOLUTELY INDEPENDENT OF THE FAME OR STATION OF THE MAN WHO GAVE IT TO THE WORLD
THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS OF FACT NOT ONLY BUT OF PHILOSOPHY OF THEORY
SUPPOSE I SHOULD SAY THAT AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH THERE IS A DIAMOND ONE HUNDRED MILES IN DIAMETER AND THAT I WOULD GIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ANY MAN WHO WOULD BELIEVE MY STATEMENT
MIND IS NOT AN EXOTIC
HAVING BEEN CONVINCED THAT SOCIETY HAS NO HATRED THAT NOBODY WISHES TO PUNISH TO DEGRADE OR TO ROB HIM
I HAVE BROUGHT UNTO THEE MY SON WHICH HATH A DUMB SPIRIT
BUT IF HE HONESTLY CONCLUDES THAT THE BIBLE IS NOT A REVELATION FROM GOD AND DIES WITH THAT CONCLUSION IN HIS MIND HE WILL BE TORMENTED FOREVER
SUPPOSE THAT HE ALLOWED THE WINDS TO DESTROY CITIES AND TO CRUSH TO SHAPELESSNESS THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND ALLOWED THE LIGHTNINGS TO STRIKE THE LIFE OUT OF MOTHERS AND BABES
THEY INSISTED THAT MAN WAS A SPECIAL CREATION NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE ANIMALS BELOW HIM
A DEVIL WISHED AND IT HAPPENED
CAN HE EAT IT
CONCLUSION I HAVE THUS ENDEAVORED TO SHOW YOU SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND TO PROVE TO YOU THAT A STEP IN ORDER TO BE IN THE DIRECTION OF PROGRESS MUST BE IN THE DIRECTION OF FREEDOM
WHY DOES HE ACT AS HE DOES
A PENNY POST HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY BUT MANY LONG-HEADED MEN WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING DENOUNCED IT AS A POPISH CONTRIVANCE
AFTER THE JEWS RETURNED FROM BABYLON ABOUT 400 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST EZRA COMMENCED MAKING THE BIBLE
YET ACCORDING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT CHRIST OFFERED A REWARD TO THOSE WHO WOULD BELIEVE AND THIS PROMISED REWARD WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF EVIDENCE
A LITTLE HUNTING A LITTLE FISHING PULLING A LITTLE FRUIT AND DIGGING FOR ROOTS--ALL SIMPLE
THEY HAVE ENLARGED THE HORIZON OF THE KNOWN CHANGED THE GLITTERING SPECKS THAT SHINE ABOVE US TO WHEELING WORLDS AND FILLED ALL SPACE WITH COUNTLESS SUNS
THEY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE HUMAN BODY--WITH MUSCLE BLOOD AND NERVE--WITH THE WONDERS OF THE BRAIN
LIVING HAS AT LAST BECOME COMPLEX
HE WHO DENIES JUSTICE TO ANOTHER DENIES IT TO HIMSELF
WHEN JESUS SAW HIM HE AND KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN NOW A LONG TIME IN THAT CASE HE SAITH UNTO HIM
LET US PRESERVE THE VERACITY OF OUR SOULS
EVIDENTLY THE INSPIRED HISTORIAN MADE A MISTAKE
REASON IS THE LIGHT THE SUN OF THE BRAIN
THAT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS HALF MAN THAT HE WAS OF THE BLOOD OF DAVID THROUGH HIS SUPPOSED FATHER JOSEPH WHO WAS NOT HIS FATHER AND THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BELIEVE THAT CHRIST WAS GOD
BUT LIBERTY RISING ABOVE PARTY PREJUDICE FREEDOM LIFTING ITSELF ABOVE ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AS SOME TALL CLIFF THAT LIFTS ITS AWFUL FORM SWELLS FROM THE VALE AND MIDWAY LEAVES THE STORM THOUGH ROUND ITS BREAST THE ROLLING CLOUDS ARE SPREAD ETERNAL SUNSHINE SETTLES ON ITS HEAD AND ON THE 1ST DAY OF JANUARY 1863 THE GRANDEST NEW YEAR THAT EVER DAWNED UPON THIS CONTINENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WILL OF THE HEROIC NORTH BY THE SUBLIME ACT OF ONE WHOSE NAME WILL BE SACRED THROUGH ALL THE COMING YEARS THE JUSTICE SO LONG DELAYED WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND FOUR MILLIONS OF SLAVES BECAME CHAINLESS
MINISTERS ASK
THEY DECLARE THAT THE LITERARY MASTER-PIECES OF THE WORLD ARE UNFIT TO BE READ
AND IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER WE ARE TOLD THAT UNCLEAN SPIRITS CRYING WITH A LOUD VOICE CAME OUT OF THEM IN THE THIRTEEN CHAPTER PAUL CALLS ELYMAS THE CHILD OF THE DEVIL AND IN THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF A DAMSEL POSSESSED WITH A SPIRIT OF DIVINATION WHO BROUGHT HER MASTERS MUCH GAIN BY SOOTHSAYING PAUL AND SILAS IT WOULD SEEM CAST OUT THIS SPIRIT AND BY REASON OF THAT SUFFERED GREAT PERSECUTION
WOULD THE LYNCHERS BE MORE FEROCIOUS IF THEY WORSHIPED GODS OF WOOD AND STONE
HAS IT TAUGHT MEN TO CULTIVATE THE EARTH
HOUSES AND STREETS WERE LIGHTED WITH GAS
MR GREELEY THERE AINT NO FIRE IN THAT STOVE YOU D----D LITTLE RASCAL SAID GREELEY WHAT DID YOU TELL ME FOR I WAS GETTING REAL WARM III
THEY DENY THAT ANY CONTRADICTIONS EXIST
THIS COURT SHOULD BE IN PERPETUAL SESSION
WE NEVER HAD A VACATION
HE WAS DUMB AND DEAF
EVERY GOOD MAN EVERY GOOD WOMAN SHOULD TRY TO DO AWAY WITH WAR TO STOP THE APPEAL TO SAVAGE FORCE
AND HE WAS AS ONE DEAD
SOME OF THE PERSIANS THOUGHT THAT THE EVIL WOULD FINALLY TRIUMPH BUT OTHERS INSISTED THAT THE GOOD WOULD BE THE VICTOR
THIS IS REAL RELIGION
HE SHOULD EXAMINE ALL QUESTIONS PRESENTED TO HIS MIND WITHOUT PREJUDICE,--UNBIASED BY HATRED OR LOVE--BY DESIRE OR FEAR
MUST EVERY MAN WHO SITS DOWN TO A DECENT DINNER ALWAYS THINK OF THE STARVING
IT ENDEAVORED TO MAKE THE WORLD OF ONE BELIEF
I THANK THE SAVAGES WHO HUNTED AND FISHED THAT THEY AND THEIR BABES MIGHT LIVE
THEY ARE THROWN UPON THE WORLD WITHOUT MEANS--WITHOUT FRIENDS--THEY ARE CONVICTS
I HEARD HUNDREDS OF THESE EVANGELICAL SERMONS--HEARD HUNDREDS OF THE MOST FEARFUL AND VIVID DESCRIPTIONS OF THE TORTURES INFLICTED IN HELL OF THE HORRIBLE STATE OF THE LOST
THE ANGEL THAT APPEARED TO JOSEPH OR THAT INFORMED JOSEPH SAID NOTHING TO ANYBODY ELSE
IT WILL ABOLISH POVERTY AND CRIME AND GREATER GRANDER NOBLER THAN ALL ELSE IT WILL MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD FREE
FOR MANY CENTURIES OUR FATHERS CLOSED THEIR EYES TO THE CONTRADICTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES OF THE TESTAMENT AND IN SPITE OF THEIR REASON HARMONIZED THE INTERPOLATIONS AND MISTAKES
IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT THE SUPERNATURAL DOES NOT AND CANNOT EXIST
WHEN THE SUN WAS BEHIND THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS NIGHT AND WHEN ON THE SIDE NEXT US IT WAS DAY
THE GOOD AND THE TRUE HAVE BEEN WITH US AND THE WOMEN OF THE NORTH HAVE WON GLORY IMPERISHABLE
WE NOW KNOW THAT ALL THE SACRED RELICS ARE RELIGIOUS RUBBISH
HE TOOK FOR HIS TEXT THE PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS HE DESCRIBED DIVES THE RICH MAN--HIS MANNER OF LIFE THE EXCESSES IN WHICH HE INDULGED HIS EXTRAVAGANCE HIS RIOTOUS NIGHTS HIS PURPLE AND FINE LINEN HIS FEASTS HIS WINES AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
BUT I CANNOT ACCEPT IT ALL
IT CANNOT BE THESE SERMONS MADE BUT FAINT IMPRESSIONS ON MY MIND
I KNEW THE WORKS OF THOSE WHO REGARDED ALL NATURE AS DEPRAVED AND LOOKED UPON LOVE AS THE LEGACY AND PERPETUAL WITNESS OF ORIGINAL SIN
SOME NATIONS BEGAN TO THINK BUT SPAIN CONTINUED TO BELIEVE
I SUPPOSED THAT WHAT I HEARD WAS TRUE AND YET I DID NOT BELIEVE IT
THE ABSOLUTE WE CANNOT KNOW--BEYOND THE HORIZON OF THE NATURAL WE CANNOT GO
THEIR LAWS MERELY REGULATED ROBBERY AND ESTABLISHED THEFT
HOW REVENGEFUL IS BOUNDLESS LOVE
IN THE DEAR OLD RELIGIOUS DAYS THE EARTH WAS FLAT--A LITTLE DISHING IF ANYTHING--AND JUST ABOVE IT WAS JEHOVAH'S HOUSE AND JUST BELOW IT WAS WHERE THE DEVIL LIVED
THEY KNEW THAT GOD GOVERNED THE WORLD BY HOPE AND FEAR BY PROMISE AND THREAT BY REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
I THANK THE HONEST MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SINCERE THOUGHTS WHO HAVE BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES AND HAVE PRESERVED THE VERACITY OF THEIR SOULS
IN THE OLDEN TIME WHEN I WAS A BOY EVEN YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS IN THE LITTLE TOWNS
WE NOW KNOW THAT HEAVEN IS NOT JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS AND THAT HELL IS NOT JUST BELOW THE EARTH
POOR SPAIN WRECKED BY FAITH THE VICTIM OF RELIGION
WE MUST HAVE CORNER-STONES
AND YET BY THIS MACHINERY WE CAN PRODUCE ENOUGH TO FLOOD THE WORLD
SO WE SEE THAT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT CAME OUT OF HEAVEN THE SAME SPIRIT THAT SAID THIS IS MY BELOVED SON DROVE CHRIST INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED OF SATAN
THEY DO NOT KNOW
THEY DO NOT KNOW
THEY DO NOT KNOW
THIS FRIGHTFUL DOGMA THIS INFINITE LIE MADE ME THE IMPLACABLE ENEMY OF CHRISTIANITY
IT WAS NOT GOD'S PLAN TO DEVELOP THE HUMAN BRAIN SO THAT MAN WOULD PERCEIVE AND COMPREHEND THE RIGHT AND AVOID THE WRONG
EVERY KINGDOM DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF IS BROUGHT TO DESOLATION
AGAINST THE GREAT AND BRAVE THINKERS IT HAS COINED AND CIRCULATED COUNTLESS LIES
HE INJURES ONE THAT HE LOVES
THE TRUE MAN WHEN ASKED TO BELIEVE ASKS FOR EVIDENCE
THE OLD TESTAMENT MUST BE THROWN ASIDE
LET US ADMIT THAT THE WRITERS BELIEVED WHAT THEY WROTE
ARE THERE ALWAYS TO BE MILLIONS WHOSE LIPS ARE WHITE WITH FAMINE
HAVING OUTGROWN JEHOVAH THEY TALK ABOUT THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS
IN THEIR PRESENCE THE UNGODLY SHOULD REMOVE THEIR HATS
THEOLOGY LOOKED MORE ABSURD THAN EVER
FOR THOSE WHO RESISTED THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE EVIL ONE REWARDS WERE WAITING IN ANOTHER WORLD BUT THE DEVIL REWARDED HERE IN THIS LIFE
WHEN I READ THESE ANSWERS I THOUGHT OF THIS LINE FROM HEINE
WELL SOMETIMES HE IS FOOLISH--SOMETIMES HE IS CRUEL AND SOMETIMES HE IS INSANE
AND THIS WILL CONTINUE AS LONG AS SOCIETY IS IGNORANT ENOUGH AND HYPOCRITICAL ENOUGH TO HOLD IN HIGH ESTEEM THE MAN OF WEALTH WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD TO THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN
IF IT WAS ROUND HOW COULD MEN ON THE OTHER SIDE AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT SEE THE COMING OF THE LORD
OF COURSE SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY AND THE LEARNED JUDGE CHARGED THE JURY THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBT AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF WITCHES THAT ALL HISTORY SACRED AND PROFANE AND THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY COUNTRY PROVED IT BEYOND ANY MANNER OF DOUBT
THE MONEY WILL OWN HIM
THEY SHOULD ADORN ITS NICHES WITH STATUES AND ITS WALLS WITH PICTURES
FROM THE BEGINNING OF HISTORY UNTIL NOW MAN HAS BEEN SEEKING THE AID OF THE SUPERNATURAL
IT TAUGHT THAT THE BUSINESS OF THIS LIFE WAS TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
WHEN WAS CHRIST BORN
IT WAS A WAR OF DARKNESS AGAINST LIGHT OF SLAVERY AGAINST LIBERTY OF SUPERSTITION AGAINST REASON
THIS GOD MUST HAVE FORCE AND WE CANNOT CONCEIVE OF FORCE APART FROM MATTER
EVERY CRIME IS A NECESSARY PRODUCT
THEY CLAIM THAT THEIR INSPIRED BOOK IS SUPERIOR TO REASON AND INDEPENDENT OF EVIDENCE
LOVE'S SACRED FLAME WITHIN THE HEART AND FRIENDSHIP'S GLOW
WITH THIS BOOK THEY DESTROYED INTELLECTUAL VERACITY THE NATURAL MANLINESS OF MAN
I THANK THE FIRST TRUE FRIEND
IN THE PRISON OF GOD
IF CHRISTIANITY WERE ONLY STUPID AND UNSCIENTIFIC IF ITS GOD WAS IGNORANT AND KIND IF IT PROMISED ETERNAL JOY TO BELIEVERS AND IF THE BELIEVERS PRACTICED THE FORGIVENESS THEY TEACH FOR ONE I SHOULD LET THE FAITH ALONE
THE INTELLIGENT PREFER DEATH TO SLAVERY
BUT HOW IS IT WITH US
CHRISTIANS FOUND THAT MOHAMMEDAN GOLD WAS NOT THE LESS VALUABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINES OF ITS OWNERS
THAT GOD HAS NO FLESH OR BLOOD
SO WE OUGHT TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT GREAT WEALTH IS A CURSE
THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF THE THEATRE
DID THE PHARISEES BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF DEVILS OR HAD THEY THE PERSONIFICATION IDEA
AT HIS COMMAND BABES WERE BUTCHERED WOMEN VIOLATED AND THE WHITE HAIR OF TREMBLING AGE STAINED WITH BLOOD
THE TOIL AND WEALTH WERE LOST
TEACH THEM THAT WHOEVER IS AN IDLER WHOEVER LIVES UPON THE LABOR OF OTHERS WHETHER HE IS A PIRATE OR A KING IS A DISHONORABLE PERSON
WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOPE AND KNOWLEDGE WE HOPE FOR HAPPINESS HERE AND WE DREAM OF JOY HEREAFTER BUT WE DO NOT KNOW
BISHOPS BLESSED HER ARMIES AND SPRINKLED HOLY WATER ON HER SHIPS AND YET HER ARMIES WERE DEFEATED AND CAPTURED LIER SHIPS BATTERED BEACHED AND BURNED AND IN HER HELPLESSNESS SHE SUED FOR PEACE
THIS IS WHAT THE LAWYERS CALL A DEPARTURE IN PLEADING
MANY AGES AGO OUR FATHERS WERE LIVING IN DENS AND CAVES
THEY HAVE CHANGED WATER TO STEAM INVENTED ENGINES--THE TIRELESS GIANTS THAT WORK FOR MAN
THE THEOLOGIANS THOUGHT THAT THE BUILDERS OF BABEL WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IF GOD HAD NOT COME DOWN AND CAUSED THEM TO FORGET THE MEANING OF WORDS
THEY WISH TO BE SHIELDED FROM LAUGHTER BY THE LEGISLATURE
THEY ARE LIKE THE JANITOR OF AN APARTMENT HOUSE WHO REFUSED TO RENT A FLAT TO A GENTLEMAN BECAUSE HE SAID HE HAD CHILDREN
ARE THESE PERSONIFICATIONS ENTITIES
DID A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL PREVENT THE DUMB MAN FROM TALKING
AND THIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT GOD NEVER HAD ANY FLESH OR BLOOD BUT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SPIRIT WITHOUT BODY PARTS OR PASSIONS
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS DRAW A FEW BREATHS AND FADE AWAY IN THE ARMS OF THEIR MOTHERS
DOES HE WANT HIS CHILDREN MISLED AND CORRUPTED SO THAT HE CAN HAVE THE PLEASURE OF DAMNING THEIR SOULS
A CATHOLIC IS IN FAVOR OF ENOUGH EDUCATION TO MAKE A CATHOLIC OUT OF A SAVAGE AND THE PROTESTANT IS IN FAVOR OF ENOUGH EDUCATION TO MAKE A PROTESTANT OUT OF A CATHOLIC BUT BOTH ARE OPPOSED TO THE EDUCATION THAT MAKES FREE AND MANLY MEN
THE SAME GOD MADE THE EAGLE THE VULTURE THE HAWK AND THEIR HELPLESS PREY
THAT JOSEPH WAS HIS FATHER
BUT IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT A MAN LIVING ALONE MIGHT ENTICE ANOTHER TO HIS HOUSE IN THE NIGHT-TIME KILL HIM AND THEN PRETEND THAT HIS VICTIM WAS A ROBBER
I LEARNED SOMETHING OF THE ACTION OF FIRE--OF WATER--OF THE FORMATION OF ISLANDS AND CONTINENTS--OF THE SEDIMENTARY AND IGNEOUS ROCKS--OF THE COAL MEASURES--OF THE CHALK CLIFFS SOMETHING ABOUT CORAL REEFS--ABOUT THE DEPOSITS MADE BY RIVERS THE EFFECT OF VOLCANOES OF GLACIERS AND OF THE ALL SURROUNDING SEA--JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE LAURENTIAN ROCKS WERE MILLIONS OF AGES OLDER THAN THE GRASS BENEATH MY FEET--JUST ENOUGH TO FEEL CERTAIN THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN PURSUING ITS FLIGHT ABOUT THE SUN WHEELING IN LIGHT AND SHADE FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS--JUST ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE INSPIRED WRITER KNEW NOTHING OF THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH--NOTHING OF THE GREAT FORCES OF NATURE--OF WIND AND WAVE AND FIRE--FORCES THAT HAVE DESTROYED AND BUILT WRECKED AND WROUGHT THROUGH ALL THE COUNTLESS YEARS
AND YET IT WERE BETTER FAR THAT ALL THIS SHOULD BE FALSE THAN THAT ALL OF THE NEW TESTAMENT SHOULD BE TRUE
IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS AND IS IN ITS CRADLE STILL
EVERY LEAF A BATTLE-FIELD--EVERY FLOWER A GOLGOTHA--IN EVERY DROP OF WATER PURSUIT CAPTURE AND DEATH
A LAY SERMON
A LAY SERMON
STANDING IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HISTORY KNOWING THE EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND KNOWING THAT THE EARTH IS COVERED WITH COUNTLESS WRECKS OF CRUEL FAILURES
THE DISCIPLES THEN ASKED JESUS WHY THEY COULD NOT CAST THAT DEVIL OUT
THINK OF ALL THE CRIMES YOU HAVE WANTED TO COMMIT
WHAT IS A MIRACLE
NOT ALWAYS
FOR MY OWN PART I SEE NO FINAL AND SATISFACTORY SOLUTION EXCEPT THROUGH THE CIVILIZATION OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYED
NOW IT WILL NOT DO TO SAY THAT THESE DEVILS WERE DISEASES BECAUSE DISEASES COULD NOT TALK AND DISEASES WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE CHRIST AS THE SON OF GOD
THEY GIVE NEW MEANINGS TO THE INSPIRED WORDS
GOD PITY ALL OF US SHOULD SHE LOOK BACK FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE I CANNOT CALL THIS CIVILIZATION
FOR THE LIFE SHE HAS SHE IS INDEBTED TO THE ENEMIES OF SUPERSTITION
WE KNOW THAT GENESIS WAS WRITTEN AFTER THE CAPTIVITY--BECAUSE IT WAS FROM THE BABYLONIANS THAT THE JEWS GOT THE STORY OF THE CREATION--OF ADAM AND EVE OF THE GARDEN--OF THE SERPENT AND THE TREE OF LIFE--OF THE FLOOD--AND FROM THEM THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE SABBATH
BUT WE KNOW THAT GOOD IS GOOD
WAS HE PURE
BECAUSE THE POLITICAL POWER IS EQUALLY DIVIDED
THIS DUST SETTLED OVER AREAS AS LARGE AS EUROPE AND IN SOME PLACES THE CHALK IS A MILE IN DEPTH
EDUCATION IS THE MOST RADICAL ABOLITIONIST IN THE WORLD
SCIENCE BEGAN TO UNFOLD THE WINGS THAT WILL FINALLY FILL THE HEAVENS
DID CHRIST BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
THE GREAT MECHANICS DWELL IN THE REALM OF THE REAL
AND SUPPER BEING ENDED THE DEVIL HAVING NOW PUT INTO THE HEART OF JUDAS ISCARIOT SIMON'S SON TO BETRAY HIM
LOVE DOES NOT SPEAK THE WORDS OF HATRED
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS HAVE BEEN SACRIFICED UPON THE ALTAR OF THIS IGNORANT AND IDIOTIC BELIEF
DID THEY ADD TO THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF THE WORLD
RAILROADS BEGAN TO BE BUILT
THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF COUNCILS AND SYNODS--THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF OCCASIONS WHEN THE CLERGY HAVE MET AND DISCUSSED AND QUARRELED--WHEN POPE AND CARDINALS BISHOPS AND PRIESTS HAVE ADDED TO OR EXPLAINED THEIR CREEDS--AND DENIED THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
IS MAN IMMORTAL
THAT THE HEBREW WAS THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE AND EVERY FACT INCONSISTENT WITH THAT IDEA WAS DISCARDED
DID HE MEAN THAT HE CURED DISEASES
THAT WE EXECUTED OUR LAWS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF BLOODHOUNDS OWNED AND TRAINED BY HUMAN BLOODHOUNDS FIERCER STILL AND THAT ALL THIS WAS NOT ONLY UPHELD BY POLITICIANS BUT BY THE PRETENDED MINISTERS OF CHRIST
NOW WHAT DID CHRIST MEAN BY DEVILS
POSSIBLY IT IS DANGEROUS FOR THIRTEEN TO DINE TOGETHER BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THEY WERE PIOUS AND PITILESS--DEVOUT AND DEVILISH--MEEK AND MALICIOUS--RELIGIOUS AND REVENGEFUL--CHRIST-LIKE AND CRUEL--LOVING WITH THEIR MOUTHS AND HATING WITH THEIR HEARTS
DO PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL TALK
DOES THE OLD TESTAMENT TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF A REAL LIVING DEVIL
SO MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE WORKINGMAN THAT I HAVE HOPE AND GREAT HOPE OF THE FUTURE
BUT JOSEPH WROTE NOTHING ON THAT SUBJECT--SAID NOTHING SO FAR AS WE KNOW
BUT THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED OF ANY VALUE
I THANK THE GREAT INVENTORS--THOSE WHO GAVE US MOVABLE TYPE AND THE PRESS BY MEANS OF WHICH GREAT THOUGHTS AND ALL DISCOVERED FACTS ARE MADE IMMORTAL--THE INVENTORS OF ENGINES OF THE GREAT SHIPS OF THE RAILWAYS THE CABLES AND TELEGRAPHS
RELIGION DOES NOT TEACH SELF-RELIANCE INDEPENDENCE MANLINESS COURAGE SELF-DEFENCE
THEN HEROD CALLED THE WISE MEN AND ASKED THEM WHEN THE STAR APPEARED AND TOLD THEM TO GO TO BETHLEHEM AND REPORT TO HIM
THEY WERE FOND OF SNAKES AND RAW FISH
HE MUST DEPEND ON EDUCATION ON WHAT HE CAN ASCERTAIN BY THE USE OF HIS SENSES BY OBSERVATION BY EXPERIMENT AND REASON
I AM FIGHTING THE ABSURD,-THE MONSTROUS THE CRUEL
IT IS USELESS TO FILL THE MIND WITH DATES OF GREAT BATTLES WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS OF KINGS
WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND WITHOUT FEAR HE FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF LIFE FROM THE LOWEST TO THE HIGHEST FORMS
THE ANGELS THAT VISITED ABRAHAM AND THE MOTHER OF SAMSON ARE AS UNREAL AS THE GHOSTS AND GOBLINS OF THE MIDDLE AGES
THE FUTURE REMAINS ETERNAL AND ALL THE PAST IS AS THOUGH IT HAD NOT BEEN--AS THOUGH IT WERE TO BE
HERE THE POPE AND PEASANT ARE EQUAL
IT ALL RESTS ON DREAMS AND VISIONS OF THE INSANE
JUST OLD-FASHIONED LIES
THEY HAVE TORTURED AND IMPRISONED FLAYED ALIVE AND BURNED
NO ONE HAS IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO PAINT THE AGONIES THAT WERE ENDURED BY REASON OF THIS BELIEF IN WITCHCRAFT
NOW I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND YOU ASK ME IF I AM PREPARED
CIVILIZED MEN DO NOT SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES BY A RESORT TO ARMS
THAT YOU MUST BE BAPTIZED BY IMMERSION
IN THE GREATEST TRAGEDY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN BY MAN--IN THE FOURTH SCENE OF THE THIRD ACT--IS THE BEST PRAYER THAT I HAVE EVER READ
IS THIS STORY TRUE
AND ALL THE PEOPLE BELIEVED IT THEIR SOLEMN DUTY TO THWART THE DEVIL BY ALL MEANS IN THEIR POWER AND THEY ACCORDINGLY SET THEMSELVES AT WORK HANGING AND BURNING EVERYBODY SUSPECTED OF BEING IN LEAGUE WITH THE ENEMY OF MANKIND
THEY MUST GIVE UP ABRAHAM AND THE WRESTLING MATCH BETWEEN JACOB AND THE LORD
LUKE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HATRED OF HEROD THE MURDER OF THE BABES OR THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT
THEY DID NOT KILL--THEY LENGTHENED LIFE
IS HE MADE BETTER
THE TRUTH IS THAT HE LABORED ALL HIS LIFE FOR THE GOOD OF HIS FELLOW-MEN AND DID AS MUCH TO FOUND THE GREAT REPUBLIC AS ANY MAN WHO EVER STOOD BENEATH OUR FLAG
THEY MUST HAVE EARS AND ORGANS OF SPEECH AND THEY MUST BE DUMB BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH THE APPARATUS OF SPEAKING AND THEY MUST BE DEAF BECAUSE SOMETHING IS THE MATTER WITH THEIR EARS
THAT ALL MEN WHO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT OF NATURE WILL BE DAMNED FOR THEIR PAINS
WHO WERE THESE WISE MEN
THAT HE WAS PLEASED WHEN PARENTS SHED THE BLOOD OF THEIR BABES
THE WANTS OF THE SAVAGE ARE FEW
THEY WROTE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN EYE-WITNESSES OF EVERY OCCURRENCE THAT THEY RELATED
I PITY THE MOST OF THEM
THOUSANDS OF MEN AT THIS MOMENT ARE TRYING TO INVENT MORE DEADLY WEAPONS TO DESTROY THEIR FELLOW-MEN
GIVE UP THE DEVIL AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE BOOK OF JOB
I THANK REMBRANDT AND COROT
THE LAW SAYS NOT THAT SOMEBODY SHALL BE HANGED BUT THAT THE MURDERER SHALL SUFFER DEATH
IT IS ALSO KNOWN THAT CERTAIN FORMS OF LIFE EXISTED IN EUROPE MANY AGES AGO AND THAT MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO THESE FORMS DISAPPEARED
IT WAS HONEST
HE SAW THE PEOPLE LOOK WITH SAD EYES UPON THE BARREN EARTH AND HE SENT NO RAIN
IN OTHER WORDS TO DO ANYTHING CONTRARY TO OR WITHOUT REGARD TO THE FACTS IN NATURE IS TO PERFORM A MIRACLE
THIS IS WHAT THE CHURCH CALLS VIRTUE
ALL THESE HAD TO BE PAID FOR
THEY INSIST THAT ALL SHALL BELIEVE
NEITHER AM I AFRAID OF THE MONOPOLISTS BECAUSE UNDER OUR INSTITUTIONS WHEN THEY BECOME HURTFUL TO THE GENERAL GOOD THE PEOPLE WILL STAND IT JUST TO A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN COMES THE END--NOT IN ANGER NOT IN HATE BUT FROM A LOVE OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE
IN THE WILDERNESS JESUS FASTED FORTY DAYS AND THEN THE DEVIL ASKED HIM TO TURN STONES INTO BREAD
THAT IS THE ONLY LUXURY WE EVER HAD
THESE ANGELS WATCHED OVER INFANTS WHO HAD BEEN BAPTIZED OVER PERSONS WHO HAD MADE HOLY VOWS OVER PRIESTS AND NUNS AND WANDERING BEGGARS WHO BELIEVED
THE CHURCH WAS OPPOSED TO FIRE INSURANCE--TO LIFE INSURANCE
IT MAKES GOD A WILD BEAST--AN INFINITE HYENA
SLOWLY PAINFULLY ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY THEY ADVANCED
SUPERSTITION INVENTED AND USED THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE FLAYED MEN AND WOMEN ALIVE LOADED MILLIONS WITH CHAINS AND DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WITH FIRE
NO SUBJECT CAN BE TOO SACRED TO BE UNDERSTOOD
THE FACT TOOK THE SAILOR'S SIDE
AND WHILE IT MAY BE THAT THE EMPLOYERS COULD BE BOUND BY THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATORS THERE HAS BEEN NO WAY DISCOVERED BY WHICH THE EMPLOYEES COULD BE HELD BY SUCH DECISION
BOTH ASK FOR SUPERNATURAL AID AND NEITHER HAS THE SLIGHTEST THOUGHT OF THE ABSOLUTE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE
AFTERWARD THEY SAID THE FACTS AS CLAIMED WERE TRUE AND THAT THEY ESTABLISHED BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE AND THE DIVINE ORIGIN OF ORTHODOX RELIGION
VOLTAIRE WHO WAGED WAR AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THRONES THE GREED AND HEARTLESSNESS OF POWER
ASIATE AS 1740 A COW WAS ABSOLUTELY TRIED ON A CHARGE OF BEING POSSESSED OF THE DEVIL
IF WE CANNOT THANK THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES--IF WE CANNOT THANK THE UNKNOWN THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE SUPERNATURAL--IF WE CANNOT THANK NATURE--IF WE CAN NOT KNEEL TO A GUESS OR PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE A PERHAPS--WHOM SHALL WE THANK
AND THIS IS THE REASON SAYS HE THAT HIS FOLLOWERS ABHOR PORK EVEN UNTO THIS DAY
1896 I
1896 I
THEY SHOULD BE PHILANTHROPISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS
IF THE GOSPELS TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF GOD--OF CHRIST--THEY TEACH THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
WE HAVE ALL THE LINKS OF THE CHAIN TWENTY-SIX LINKS INCLUSIVE FROM MONER TO MAN
THE JEWELED CUP OF LOVE WE DRAIN AND FRIENDSHIP'S WINE NOW SWIFTLY FLOWS IN EVERY VEIN WITH WARMTH DIVINE
SO ALL INVESTIGATION--ALL EXPERIMENT--SHOULD BE PURSUED IN THE LIGHT OF REASON
WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR A MAN SUFFERING DEATH FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE RIGHT
NO ORTHODOX CHURCH EVER WAS OR EVER WILL BE IN FAVOR OF REAL EDUCATION
THAT HE SHOULD BECOME A DEVIL
IN THE NINETEENTH CHAPTER CERTAIN VAGABOND JEWS PRONOUNCED OVER THOSE WHO HAD EVIL SPIRITS THE NAME OF JESUS AND THE EVIL SPIRITS ANSWERED
THE QUESTION NATURALLY ARISES
THERE YOU WILL FIND NO GOBLINS GHOSTS WRAITHS OR IMPS--NO WITCHES SPOOKS OR SORCERERS
THAT HE ATTACKED THE RELIGION OF HIS TIME BECAUSE IT WAS CRUEL
THE SCIENCE OF THEOLOGY THE ONLY DISHONEST SCIENCE--MOSES AND BRIGHAM YOUNG--MINDS POISONED AND PARALYZED IN YOUTH--SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND THEOLOGICAL SEMINARIES--ORTHODOX SLANDERERS OF SCIENTISTS--RELIGION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CHARITY--HOSPITALS BUILT IN SELF-DEFENCE--WHAT GOOD HAS THE CHURCH ACCOMPLISHED?--OF WHAT USE ARE THE ORTHODOX MINISTERS AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND--THE HARM THEY ARE DOING--DELUSIONS THEY TEACH--TRUTHS THEY SHOULD TELL ABOUT THE BIBLE--CONCLUSIONS--OUR CHRISTS AND OUR MIRACLES
WHAT EVIDENCE HAVE WE THAT HE EXISTS
A MAN STEALS AND THEN SACRIFICES A DOVE OR GIVES A LAMB TO A PRIEST
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT THE MARRIED ARE JOINED TOGETHER BY SOME SUPERNATURAL POWER AND THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN TOGETHER OR AT LEAST MARRIED DURING LIFE
HOW CAN YOU REFORM HIM
WE'VE SET OURSELVES THE NOBLE TASK TO FIND THE REAL
IT BECAME A HYDRA-HEADED MONSTER--A SERPENT REACHING IN TERRIBLE COILS FROM THE HEAVENS AND THRUSTING ITS THOUSAND FANGS INTO THE BLEEDING QUIVERING HEARTS OF MEN
AS MAN PROGRESSED HE OBTAINED A WIDER VIEW EXTENDED THE INTELLECTUAL HORIZON AND AGAIN HE CHANGED HIS GOD MAKING HIM AS NEARLY PERFECT AS HE COULD AND YET THIS GOD WAS PATTERNED AFTER THOSE WHO MADE HIM
THE HANDS THAT BUILT THEM WERE UNPAID
MEN OF GENIUS WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART FREE FROM RELIGIOUS PREJUDICE WERE EXAMINING THESE THINGS--WERE LOOKING FOR FACTS
LET AN INFINITE GOD IF THERE BE ONE ATTACK A GRAIN OF SAND--ATTACK IT WITH INFINITE POWER
AT LAST WE KNOW THAT THE STORY OF CREATION OF THE BEGINNING OF THINGS AS TOLD IN THE SACRED BOOK IS NOT ONLY UNTRUE BUT UTTERLY ABSURD AND IDIOTIC
WHEN THERE WAS NO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND NO PRESS THEN EVERY IDEA PERISHED IN THE BRAIN THAT GAVE IT BIRTH
THE BOOKS FILLED WITH THE FACTS OF NATURE ARE OUR SACRED SCRIPTURES AND THE FORCE THAT IS IN EVERY ATOM AND IN EVERY STAR--IN EVERYTHING THAT LIVES AND GROWS AND THINKS THAT HOPES AND SUFFERS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE GOD
THEY DID NOT PRETEND TO BE INSPIRED--DID NOT CLAIM TO BE PROPHETS OR SAINTS OR TO HAVE BEEN BORN AGAIN
THE MEN WHO CULTIVATE THE EARTH SHOULD OWN IT
OUR HEARTS BY EARNEST THOUGHT ARE SCHOOLED TO BEAR THE WORST
CONTRADICTIONS CANNOT DISTURB THEIR FAITH
SO WE IN THE UNITED STATES BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHORITY TO GOVERN THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE AND EXECUTE LAWS COMES FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED AND NOT FROM ANY SUPERNATURAL SOURCE
NOT ONE OF THE COUNTLESS THINGS AND RELATIONS IN THE UNIVERSE COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
THEY NOW TALK ABOUT THE UNKNOWN THE INFINITE ENERGY BUT THEY PUT JEHOVAH WITH JUPITER
COULD THIS GOD HAVE AVOIDED BEING GOD
BEING ALLOWED BY LAW TO CHANGE HIS NAME SO THAT HIS IDENTITY WILL NOT BE PRESERVED HE COULD GO OUT OF THE PRISON A FRIEND OF THE GOVERNMENT
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR MARY TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST
NO MECHANIC DREAMS OF DEPENDING UPON OR ASKING FOR ANY SUPERNATURAL AID
THAT THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE BROUGHT DISEASE AND PAIN VICE AND DEATH INTO THE WORLD
BY LIFTING OTHERS WE ARE BLESSED
WE SHOULD THINK OF THESE THINGS--MUST THINK OF THEM--AND WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS FINALLY DONE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
MY WIFE AND I CAME HERE MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO
SOMEBODY HAD TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THORNS AND THISTLES FOR THE CRUELTIES AND CRIMES
WHICH OF THESE ACCOUNTS IS TRUE
TO WHOM DID THESE SAINTS APPEAR
WHY SHOULD THE BIBLE SPEAK OF THIS GOD AS A MAN?--OF HIS WALKING IN THE GARDEN IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING--OF HIS TALKING HEARING AND SMELLING
THERE IS NO ESCAPE
THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH ANGELS DEMONS AND MONSTERS
AND A CERTAIN MAN WAS THERE WHICH HAD AN INFIRMITY THIRTY AND EIGHT YEARS
THEY WERE PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE CELESTIAL THE TERRESTRIAL AND THE INFERNAL
NOTHING CAN BE MORE ABSURD
THERE MAY BE A POWER SUPERIOR TO NATURE A POWER THAT GOVERNS AND DIRECTS ALL THINGS BUT THE EXISTENCE OF THIS POWER HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED
ANNOYED NERVOUS TORMENTED UNTIL HIS POOR LITTLE BRAIN BECOMES INFLAMED AND YOU SEE IN THE MORNING PAPER DIED OF APOPLEXY THIS MAN FINALLY BEGAN TO WORRY FOR FEAR HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH NECKTIES TO LAST HIM THROUGH
NOBODY PRETENDED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE OR EXACTLY HOW THEY LOOKED OR IN WHAT WAY THEY WENT FROM PLACE TO PLACE OR HOW THEY AFFECTED OR CONTROLLED THE MINDS OF MEN
THE BOOKS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME DIFFERING IN A FEW MISTAKES--IN A FEW FALSEHOODS
OUR BRAVEST AND OUR BEST HAVE BEEN SACRIFICED
WHAT BECAME OF THEM
IT IS FOR YOU TO HEAR
AS SOON AS WHITE SLAVERY BEGAN TO DECAY IN EUROPE AND WHILE THE CONDITION OF THE WHITE SLAVES WAS IMPROVING ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE 16TH CENTURY IN 1541 ALONZO GONZALES OF PORTUGAL POINTED OUT TO HIS COUNTRYMEN A NEW FIELD OF OPERATIONS A NEW MARKET FOR HUMAN FLESH AND IN A SHORT TIME THE AFRICAN SLAVE-TRADE WITH ALL ITS UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS WAS INAUGURATED
INTELLIGENCE REAVES THE HEAVENS OF WINGED AND FRIGHTFUL MONSTERS--DRIVES GHOSTS AND LEERING FIENDS FROM THE DARKNESS AND FLOODS WITH LIGHT THE DUNGEONS OF FEAR
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW THERE WAS BETWEEN DAVID AND JESUS TWENTY-SEVEN GENERATIONS AND HE GIVES ALL THE NAMES
WHY HAS HE ALLOWED THE VOLCANOES TO DESTROY THE EARTHQUAKES TO DEVOUR AND THE TEMPEST TO WRECK AND REND
ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO OUR PRESIDENT BY PROCLAMATION THANKED GOD FOR GIVING US THE VICTORY AT SANTIAGO
AND HE GOES RIGHT ON MAKING MORE
THEY RIDICULED AND DERIDED DARWIN THE GREATEST NATURALIST THE KEENEST OBSERVER THE BEST JUDGE OF THE VALUE OF A FACT THE MOST WONDERFUL DISCOVERER OF TRUTH THAT THE WORLD HAS PRODUCED
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT CHRIST WAS AND IS GOD
WHEN I WAS A BOY I HEARD THEM TELL OF AN OLD FARMER IN VERMONT
IT WAS THE ENEMY OF ART AND LITERATURE
WITH QUICK LIGHTNINGS THEY ARE DASHED TO DEATH
THAT ANGELS SHUT THE MOUTHS OF THE LIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF DANIEL
THE WORKERS AND THE THINKERS THE POOR AND THE GRAND
THAT THE APOSTLES MADE NO CREED
WHO HAS INGENUITY ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THIS
HE KNOWS THAT THE MATRIMONIAL CHANCES OF A MAIDEN ARE NOT INCREASED OR DECREASED BY THE NUMBER OF LEAVES OF A FLOWER OR SEEDS IN AN APPLE
WHAT HAS OUR RELIGION DONE?--WOULD CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY ADOPTED ANOTHER FAITH?--V
THEY REALLY BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE ACTUAL WORD OF GOD--A BOOK WITHOUT MISTAKE OR CONTRADICTION
AS A RULE CHILDREN LOVE THEIR PARENTS BELIEVE WHAT THEY TEACH AND TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN SAYING THAT THE RELIGION OF MOTHER IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM
IF WE DO NOT GROW WE DECAY
APOLLO WAS A SUN-GOD AND HE FOUGHT AND CONQUERED THE SERPENT OF NIGHT
NOW WE ARE CONVINCED OF WHAT IS CALLED THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE WE BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS ACT AND ARE ACTED UPON IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR NATURE
A PROMISED REWARD IS NOT EVIDENCE
RISE TAKE UP THY BED AND WALK AND IMMEDIATELY THE MAN WAS MADE WHOLE AND TOOK UP HIS BED AND WALKED DOES ANY SENSIBLE HUMAN BEING NOW BELIEVE THIS STORY
THE FOUNDATIONS OF FAITH
THE FOUNDATIONS OF FAITH
ALL THE POPES AND PRIESTS ALL THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES AND CLERGYMEN SAY THAT THEY HAVE A REVELATION FROM GOD
AFTER NIGHTFALL A PASSENGER WENT ABOUT AT HIS PERIL FOR CHAMBER WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND SLOP PAILS UNCEREMONIOUSLY EMPTIED
THE FATHER SHALL BE DIVIDED AGAINST THE SON AND THE SON AGAINST THE FATHER THE MOTHER AGAINST THE DAUGHTER AND THE DAUGHTER AGAINST THE MOTHER THE MOTHER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND THE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST HER MOTHER-IN-LAW IF ANY MAN COME TO ME AND HATE NOT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND WIFE AND CHILDREN AND BRETHREN AND SISTERS YEA AND HIS OWN LIFE ALSO HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE BUT THOSE MINE ENEMIES WHICH WOULD NOT THAT I SHOULD REIGN OVER THEM BRING HITHER AND SLAY THEM BEFORE ME THIS PASSAGE BUILT DUNGEONS AND LIGHTED FAGOTS
HE BECOMES THE PROPERTY OF THAT MONEY
THE EARTH WAS GROWING SMALL
MY GOD WHAT A PUNISHMENT FOR BEING RICH
MEN STEAL
AND YET THIS VOLUME HOLDS ALL KNOWLEDGE ALL TRUTH AND IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF THOUGHT
THEY BRING NO BALM TO ANY WOUNDED HEART
DOES THE WORD GOD CORRESPOND WITH ANY IMAGE IN THE MIND
BUT AFTER ALL THE GODS HAVE NOT SUPPORTED THE CHILDREN OF MEN MEN HAVE SUPPORTED THE GODS
THE MEN WHO OPPOSED WHITE SLAVERY WERE RIDICULED WERE PERSECUTED DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES MOBBED HANGED TORTURED AND BURNED
THAT TO EXPRESS YOUR HONEST THOUGHT IS BLASPHEMY
WE ARE TIRED OF BARBARIAN BIBLES AND SAVAGE CREEDS
AT THE SAME TIME THEY DO NOT WISH TO GIVE UP THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE
LIBERTY THAT MOST SACRED WORD WITHOUT WHICH ALL OTHER WORDS ARE VAIN WITHOUT WHICH LIFE IS WORSE THAN DEATH AND MEN ARE BEASTS
SO THEY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY OF FINANCIAL BUT OF MENTAL HONESTY
THE DEVIL IS GONE OUT OF THY DAUGHTER IN THE NINTH CHAPTER ONE OF THE MULTITUDE SAID UNTO CHRIST
THAT YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT A HEBREW PEASANT WAS GOD
I AM NOT AN ANARCHIST
YOU ARE BEGINNING TO THROW AWAY THE MIRACULOUS
KEPLER DISCOVERED THE THREE GREAT LAWS ONE OF THE GREATEST TRIUMPHS OF HUMAN GENIUS AND OUR CONSTELLATION BECAME A POEM A SYMPHONY
SCIENCE IS ONLY IN ITS INFANCY
ADMIT THAT GOD IS INFINITELY WISE
IF ALL IS DONE BY THIS GOD WE SHOULD MAKE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS ACTIONS--BETWEEN THE ACTIONS OF THE INFINITELY WISE POWERFUL AND GOOD
AMONG SAVAGES THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
HE LOVES AND LOVE IS THE COMMENCEMENT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HIGHEST VIRTUES
TO BELIEVE IN SPITE OF EVIDENCE OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE
GOD PLACED HER KAISER ON THE THRONE
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE APOSTLES SEEMED TO HAVE RELIED UPON THE EVIDENCE OF DEVILS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE DIVINITY OF THEIR LORD
IF WE THANK HIM FOR SUNSHINE AND HARVEST WE SHOULD ALSO THANK HIM FOR PLAGUE AND FAMINE
DOES HE GIVE THEM FURLOUGHS OR TICKETS-OF-LEAVE
TO BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD IS GOVERNED BY CHANCE OR CAPRICE
ASTROLOGY BECAME ASTRONOMY
THE FIRST CHAPTER OF MARK THROWS A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE STORY OF THE TEMPTATION OF CHRIST
WE BELIEVE IN THE NATURAL
WE BELIEVE IN THE NATURAL
UPON THIS SHOWING ON THE BOOKS UPON THIS BALANCE HE WILL BE ENTITLED TO HIS HALO AND HARP
THE DESTROYERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONORED
ALL THIS HE KNEW WHEN HE CREATED THE DEVIL
FROM THE JEWS?--YES
THE ORIGINAL HAS BEEN LOST AND WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARKNESS OF NATURE
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS WITH CERTAIN APPETITES AND PASSIONS AND WITH A CERTAIN QUALITY QUANTITY AND SHAPE OF BRAIN MEN WILL BECOME THIEVES FORGERS AND COUNTERFEITERS
THE LAW SHOULD SETTLE MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOR
WE HAVE BORNE THE BLOODY BURDEN OF WAR
THE DEVIL WENT AWAY AND ANGELS CAME AND MINISTERED TO CHRIST
THEY INTRODUCED THE TEN NUMERALS--TAUGHT ALGEBRA AND TRIGONOMETRY--UNDERSTOOD CUBIC EQUATIONS--KNEW THE ART OF SURVEYING--THEY MADE CATALOGUES AND MAPS OF THE STARS--GAVE THE GREAT STARS THE NAMES THEY STILL BEAR--THEY ASCERTAINED THE SIZE OF THE EARTH--DETERMINED THE OBLIQUITY OF THE ECLIPTIC AND FIXED THE LENGTH OF THE YEAR
SUPERSTITION BUILT THE CATHEDRALS AND TEMPLES ALL THE ALTARS MOSQUES AND CHURCHES FILLED THE WORLD WITH AMULETS AND CHARMS WITH IMAGES AND IDOLS WITH SACRED BONES AND HOLY HAIRS WITH MARTYRS BLOOD AND RAGS WITH BITS OF WOOD THAT FRIGHTEN DEVILS FROM THE BREASTS OF MEN
YOU FIND NOTHING ABOUT THAT HOLY DAY IN JUDGES JOSHUA SAMUEL KINGS OR CHRONICLES--NOTHING IN JOB THE PSALMS IN ESTHER SOLOMON'S SONG OR ECCLESIASTES
ANOTHER WRITER OF THE 15TH CENTURY SAYS THAT AFTER IGNATIUS WAS DEAD THEY FOUND IMPRESSED UPON HIS HEART THE GREEK WORD THEOS
AND ENGLAND BECAME THE FIRST NATION OF THE WORLD THROUGH HER INVENTORS HER MERCHANTS HER MECHANICS AND IN SPITE OF HER STATESMEN HER PRIESTS AND HER NOBLES
THEY ARE SHOCKED AT THE WICKEDNESS OF THE WALTZ--THE POLLUTION OF THE POLKA
THE MINISTERS WHO PREACHED AT THESE REVIVALS WERE IN EARNEST
IF WE GIVE UP THE BELIEF IN DEVILS WE MUST GIVE UP THE INSPIRATION OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT
IN THE NAME OF EDUCATION HIS MIND HAS BEEN FILLED WITH MISTAKES WITH MIRACLES AND LIES WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE THE ABSURD AND INFAMOUS
RELIGIOUS BOOKS--THE COMMENTATORS--PALEY'S WATCH ARGUMENT--MILTON YOUNG AND POLLOK--IV
ALL THE PASSAGES ABOUT WITCHES AND THOSE HAVING FAMILIAR SPIRITS WERE BORN OF A BELIEF IN THE DEVIL
THROUGH COUNTLESS YEARS HE HAS GROPED AND CRAWLED AND STRUGGLED AND CLIMBED AND STUMBLED TOWARD THE LIGHT
WE DO NOT ENTHRONE THE UNKNOWN AND CROWN OUR IGNORANCE
AND THAT HE CURSED THE EARTH ITSELF WITH BRIERS AND THORNS BRAMBLES AND THISTLES
THERE IS ANOTHER THING
HE MUST BE TOLD THAT IT IS WICKED TO DOUBT THAT IT IS SINFUL TO INQUIRE--THAT FAITH IS A VIRTUE AND UNBELIEF A CRIME
IT WAS DELIVERED IN PEKIN 111 IN 1860 AND AGAIN IN BLOOMINGTON 111 IN 1804
HAVE THESE BEINGS BEEN SEEN OR TOUCHED
BACK OF THESE MISTAKES THESE EXAGGERATIONS THESE LIES WAS THE LOVE OF THE MARVELOUS
HE FINDS THE MAKER AND HE IS SO MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE WATCH THAT HE SAYS HE MUST HAVE HAD A MAKER
IF THE OLD TESTAMENT IS TRUE THE DEVIL DOES EXIST AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HIM AWAY WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME EXPLAINING GOD AWAY
THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED THE FALL AND FOR THIS THEY WERE EXPELLED FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN
IN THE EIGHTH CHAPTER IT IS SAID THAT OUT OF MARY MAGDALENE WERE CAST SEVEN DEVILS
THAT ALL THE HEATHEN WILL BE SAVED
IN THE PRESENCE OF THE NUDE THEY COVER THEIR FACES WITH THEIR HOLY HANDS BUT KEEP THEIR FINGERS APART
TO THEM HELL WAS A BURNING REALITY--THEY COULD SEE THE SMOKE AND FLAMES
AGAIN I SAY THAT THE WRITERS OF THE BIBLE WERE MISTAKEN
IT IS BEYOND THE REACH AND REALM OF REASON
THIS STATEMENT WAS MADE IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE POPE IN THE 14TH CENTURY AND WAS ALLUDED TO AS A WELL-KNOWN FACT
HOW CAN WE REFORM THE WORLD?--INTELLECTUAL LIGHT THE FIRST NECESSITY--AVOID WASTE OF WEALTH IN WAR--III
REMEMBER THAT THIS HORRIBLE TRAFFIC COMMENCED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 16TH CENTURY WAS CARRIED ON BY NATIONS PRETENDING TO CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION AND WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOLISHED BY SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL COUNTRIES
WHAT HAS OUR RELIGION DONE
THINK OF ALL THIS BEING PAID FOR THE PURPOSE OF KILLING AND PREPARING TO KILL OUR FELLOW-MEN
THEY SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING OF HUMAN NATURE
I DO NOT KNOW--BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
I THANK THE HEROES THE DESTROYERS OF PREJUDICE AND FEAR--THE DETHRONERS OF SAVAGE GODS--THE EXTINGUISHERS OF HATE'S ETERNAL FIRE--THE HEROES THE BREAKERS OF CHAINS--THE FOUNDERS OF FREE STATES--THE MAKERS OF JUST LAWS--THE HEROES WHO FOUGHT AND FELL ON COUNTLESS FIELDS--THE HEROES WHOSE DUNGEONS BECAME SHRINES--THE HEROES WHOSE BLOOD MADE SCAFFOLDS SACRED--THE HEROES THE APOSTLES OF REASON THE DISCIPLES OF TRUTH THE SOLDIERS OF FREEDOM--THE HEROES WHO HELD HIGH THE HOLY TORCH AND FILLED THE WORLD WITH LIGHT
WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL IN ALL THE REALM OF CHEMISTRY
ALL RELIGIONS ARE AULD WIVES FABLES BUT AN HONEST MAN HAS NOTHING TO FEAR EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THE WORLD TO COME ONE WHO HAD THE GENIUS TO WRITE HOLY WILLIE'S PRAYER--A POEM THAT CRUCIFIED CALVINISM AND THROUGH ITS BLOODLESS HEART THRUST THE SPEAR OF COMMON SENSE--A POEM THAT MADE EVERY ORTHODOX CREED THE FOOD OF SCORN--OF INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER
CAN WE PREVENT THIS MISSOURI OF IGNORANCE AND VICE FROM EMPTYING INTO THE MISSISSIPPI OF CIVILIZATION
WHY HAS HE PERMITTED THE INNOCENT TO BE IMPRISONED AND THE GOOD TO BE BURNED
WAS IT HONESTLY ACQUIRED
AT THAT TIME CHRISTIANS REALLY BELIEVED THE NEW TESTAMENT
NOW WHEN JESUS WAS BORN IN BETHLEHEM OF JUDEA IN THE DAYS OF HEROD THE KING BEHOLD THERE CAME WISE MEN FROM THE EAST TO JERUSALEM
DESIGN IS AS APPARENT IN DECAY AS IN GROWTH
THEY HAD NEVER BEEN CORRUPTED BY FLESH--BY THE PASSION OF LOVE
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AS SAVAGE AS OUR INDIANS
THEY MADE CRADLES BY PUTTING ROCKERS ON COFFINS
FOR THEY SHALL OBTAIN MERCY LOVE YOUR ENEMIES BLESS THEM THAT CURSE YOU DO GOOD TO THEM THAT HATE YOU AND PRAY FOR THEM WHICH DESPITEFULLY USE YOU AND PERSECUTE YOU TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR YOUR LIFE WHAT YE SHALL EAT OR WHAT YE SHALL DRINK NOR YET FOR YOUR BODY WHAT YE SHALL PUT ON
BELIEF IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE WILL
LIBERTY SUSTAINS THE SAME RELATION TO ALL THE VIRTUES THAT THE SUN DOES TO LIFE
THEY DISCOVERED FIRE AND PROBABLY BY ACCIDENT LEARNED HOW TO CAUSE IT BY FRICTION
EVERY SUNDAY SCHOOL IS A KIND OF INQUISITION WHERE THEY TORTURE AND DEFORM THE MINDS OF CHILDREN--WHERE THEY FORCE THEIR SOULS INTO CATHOLIC OR PROTESTANT MOULDS--AND DO ALL THEY CAN TO DESTROY THE ORIGINALITY THE INDIVIDUALITY AND THE VERACITY OF THE SOUL
HE BROUGHT A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AT THAT TIME THE GREATEST AMERICAN
EXCEPT IN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES NO WINGED CITIZEN OF THE CELESTIAL REALM HAS VISITED THE WORLD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
TELL THEM THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHO WROTE ESTHER--THAT ECCLESIASTES WAS WRITTEN LONG AFTER CHRIST--THAT MANY OF THE PROPHECIES WERE WRITTEN AFTER THE EVENTS PRETENDED TO BE FORETOLD HAD HAPPENED
IN CHEMISTRY HE SOUGHT FOR THE ELIXIR OF LIFE FOR THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND FOR SOME WAY OF CHANGING THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE DEVIL HAD CERTAIN THINGS TO GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR A SOUL
YE CANNOT DRINK THE CUP OF THE LORD AND THE CUP OF DEVILS
LET US BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER AND GIVE TO THE BIBLE ITS NATURAL OBVIOUS MEANING
THIS IS THE JUSTICE OF GOD--THE MERCY OF CHRIST
TELL THEM THAT EZEKIEL AND DANIEL WERE INSANE
IT IS NOT SIMPLY THE RIGHT BUT IT IS THE DUTY OF EVERY MAN TO THINK--TO INVESTIGATE FOR HIMSELF--AND EVERY MAN WHO TRIES TO PREVENT THIS BY FORCE OR FEAR IS DOING ALL HE CAN TO DEGRADE AND ENSLAVE HIS FELLOW-MEN
BUT SHE HAS HER CREED
I ADMIT THAT THE CHURCH HAS PREACHED FORGIVENESS BUT IT HAS NEVER FORGIVEN AN ENEMY--NEVER
AND LET ME TELL THE MINISTERS AGAIN THAT THEY SHOULD NOT WASTE THEIR TIME IN ANSWERING ME
DID HE DESIRE TO BE BETRAYED
IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS IT WAS ENACTED THAT WHEN A PERSON WAS KILLED BY A MAN LIVING ALONE AND UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE SOLITARY HOUSEHOLDER SHOULD NOT BE HELD INNOCENT UNLESS HE PRODUCED IN COURT SOME ANIMAL A DOG OR A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AN INMATE OF THE HOUSE AND HAD WITNESSED THE DEATH OF THE PERSON KILLED
NO MAN PRACTICES SELF-DENIAL UNLESS HE DOES WRONG
IF SO THE DEVILS MUST BE ORGANIZED
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WOULD ASK NOT FOR REWARDS BUT REASONS
I PRAY I BESEECH I IMPLORE THEM TO TAKE FOR THE CORNER-STONE UNIVERSAL HUMAN LIBERTY--THE STONE WHICH HAS BEEN HERETOFORE REJECTED BY ALL THE BUILDERS OF NATIONS
SUPERSTITION WAS ALMOST UNIVERSAL
THE ORTHODOX GOD--THE TWO DISPENSATIONS--THE INFINITE HORROR--III
THERE IS A GREAT BUILDING--SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF MACHINERY THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE--NOT A SINGLE MECHANIC IN THE WHOLE BUILDING
OF COURSE THE ORTHODOX STILL CLING TO EVERY WORD AND STILL INSIST THAT EVERY LINE IS TRUE
NO MAN HAVING PUT HIS HAND TO THE PLOUGH AND LOOKING BACK IS FIT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD
THEY INFORMED US THAT CHRIST HAD TWO NATURES AND TWO WILLS
THESE CHRISTIANS WERE TRUE TO THEIR CREED
IN OUR BLESSED GOSPEL,--IN OUR DIVINE SCHEME,"--THERE IS NOTHING NEW--NOTHING ORIGINAL
THEY HAD A REVELATION FROM GOD
APPEALED TO BY THE GREAT ARMY OF MARTYRS AND HEROES WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE
THEY HAVE GIVEN US THE LIBERTY TO THINK AND THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS OUR THOUGHTS
MILLIONS OF PRIESTS AND PREACHERS HAVE ADDED TO THE MYSTERIES OF THE INSPIRED BOOK BY EXPLANATION BY SHOWING THE WISDOM OF FOOLISHNESS THE FOOLISHNESS OF WISDOM THE MERCY OF CRUELTY AND THE PROBABILITY OF THE IMPOSSIBLE
IF HE IS HE DOES NOT THINK
I WILL PAY THE MAN WHO LABORS FOR ME ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM A REASONABLE SUPPORT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO ASSIST IN TAKING CARE OF WIFE AND CHILDREN ENOUGH FOR HIM TO DO THIS AND LAY ASIDE SOMETHING TO FEED AND CLOTHE HIM WHEN OLD AGE COMES
IT INSISTED THAT A CERTAIN BELIEF WAS NECESSARY TO INSURE SALVATION AND THAT ALL WHO FAILED TO BELIEVE OR DOUBTED IN THE LEAST WOULD SUFFER ETERNAL PAIN
MAN WILL BE CIVILIZED WHEN THE PASSIONS ARE DOMINATED BY THE INTELLECT WHEN REASON OCCUPIES THE THRONE AND WHEN THE HOT BLOOD OF PASSION NO LONGER RISES IN SUCCESSFUL REVOLT
PERSONIFICATIONS OF THE DEVIL--THE ORTHODOX OSTRICH THRUSTS HIS HEAD INTO THE SAND--IF DEVILS ARE PERSONIFICATIONS SO ARE ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS OF THE BIBLE--VI
THEY CRAWLED AND STUMBLED STAGGERED AND STRUGGLED TOWARD THE LIGHT
THEY HAVE GIVEN US ALL WE HAVE OF KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE AND ART
THEY DIVERTED THE REVENUES
ONE THING I DO KNOW AND THAT IS THAT NEITHER HOPE NOR FEAR BELIEF NOR DENIAL CAN CHANGE THE FACT
THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT
THE ASTRONOMY OF JOSHUA AND ELIJAH FADED FROM THE MINDS OF INTELLIGENT MEN AND JEHOVAH BECAME AN IGNORANT TRIBAL GOD
THEY LOYALLY STAND BY THE SACRED TEXT AND THEY GIVE IT THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION
FOR ME ON THAT DAY THE FLAMES OF HELL WERE QUENCHED
NOW INTELLIGENT MEN WHO ARE NOT FRIGHTENED WHOSE BRAINS HAVE NOT BEEN PARALYZED BY FEAR KNOW THAT THE SACRED STORY OF CREATION WAS WRITTEN BY AN IGNORANT SAVAGE
WE LIVED ON THE PLAINEST FOOD
HERCULES WAS A SUN-GOD AND SO WAS SAMSON WHOSE STRENGTH WAS IN HIS HAIR--THAT IS TO SAY IN HIS BEAMS
THEY TALK ABOUT PROBABILITY--ANALOGY--INFERENCES--BUT THEY PRESENT NO EVIDENCE
THE NATURE OF THESE EIGHT PERSONS WAS EVIL CORRUPT AND DEPRAVED AND IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THEIR CHILDREN WOULD BE CURSED WITH THE SAME NATURE
THEY ARE THE ENEMIES OF PLEASURE
SEES THEM OUTWIT EACH OTHER AND THEMSELVES--LEADS THEM TO EVERY CRIME WATCHES THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS--HEARS LULLABIES AT CRADLES AND THE FALL OF CLODS ON COFFINS
I SEE MEANS THAT DO NOT ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS--DESIGNS THAT SEEM TO FAIL
IT HAS ENDEAVORED TO PROTECT THE SHEEP OF GOD FROM THE WOLVES OF SCIENCE--FROM THE WILD BEASTS OF DOUBT AND INVESTIGATION
IT SOUGHT TO ENSLAVE THE WORLD
THEY SHOULD MALIGN AND VILIFY KEPLER COPERNICUS NEWTON HERSCHEL AND LAPLACE
THE WORLD IS HIS STAGE AND MANKIND HIS PUPPETS
OUR HEARTS SHOULD BLOSSOM WITH THANKFULNESS
WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH THEE THOU JESUS OF NAZARETH
BUT IN SPITE OF PRIESTS IN SPITE OF KINGS IN SPITE OF MITRES IN SPITE OF CROWNS IN SPITE OF CARDINALS AND POPES BOOKS WERE PUBLISHED AND BOOKS WERE READ
THESE POPES AND PRIESTS--THESE CLERGYMEN WERE NOT HYPOCRITES
THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY RELIGION OR BY LAW BY PRIEST OR BY HANGMAN
DOES ANY INTELLIGENT MAN NOW WHOSE BRAIN HAS NOT BEEN DEFORMED BY SUPERSTITION BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
THEY USED TO TELL THE STORY OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO IN TELLING HER EXPERIENCE SAID:--"BEFORE I WAS CONVERTED BEFORE I GAVE MY HEART TO GOD I USED TO LIE AND STEAL BUT NOW THANKS TO THE GRACE AND BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST I HAVE QUIT EM BOTH IN A GREAT MEASURE OF COURSE ALL THE PEOPLE WERE NOT EXACTLY OF ONE MIND
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SUN-GODS AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE CHIEF DEITIES IN THE ANCIENT RELIGIONS
PREJUDICE EGOTISM HATRED CONTEMPT DISDAIN ARE THE ENEMIES OF TRUTH AND PROGRESS
POSSIBLY A GLIMPSE OF THE NEW MOON OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER BRINGS MISFORTUNE
WHEN A MOTHER NURSES HER CHILD AN OPEN GRAVE SHOULD BE AT HER FEET
IF MATTER CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CREATED
LET ME BE UNDERSTOOD
DO WE PROVOKE THE LORD TO JEALOUSY IN THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER HE SAYS THAT LONG HAIR IS THE GLORY OF WOMAN BUT THAT SHE OUGHT TO KEEP HER HEAD COVERED BECAUSE OF THE ANGELS
PEOPLE UNABLE EVEN TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES FILL THE TENEMENTS THE HUTS AND HOVELS WITH CHILDREN
THERE IS ONE STEP TOWARD IT THAT WE WILL TAKE
1895 I
HOW CAN MANKIND BE REFORMED WITHOUT RELIGION
THEY MIGHT ADD THAT THEY KNOW MOSES TALKED WITH JEHOVAH ON SINAI THE SAME WAY THEY KNOW THAT BRIGHAM YOUNG TALKED WITH GOD IN UTAH
THE WORLD WAS FULL OF INVENTIONS TO DESTROY LIFE BEFORE THERE WERE ANY TO PROLONG IT OR MAKE IT ENDURABLE
THE WHOLE POWER OF THE CHURCH OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS ARRAYED UPON THE SIDE OF IGNORANCE
THE MIRACULOUS HAS DEPARTED FROM CHEMISTRY
HAVE NOT I CHOSEN YOU TWELVE AND ONE OF YOU IS A DEVIL AND JOHN ADDS
MATTER AND FORCE INDESTRUCTIBLE AND UNCREATABLE--THE THEORY OF DESIGN--X
THESE GOOD PREACHERS MUST ADMIT THAT BLOWING HORNS COULD NOT THROW DOWN THE WALLS OF A CITY THAT IT WAS HORRIBLE FOR JEPHTHAH TO SACRIFICE HIS DAUGHTER THAT THE DAY WAS NOT LENGTHENED AND THE MOON STOPPED FOR THE SAKE OF JOSHUA THAT THE DEAD SAMUEL WAS NOT RAISED BY A WITCH THAT A MAN WAS NOT CARRIED TO HEAVEN IN A CHARIOT OF FIRE THAT THE RIVER JORDAN WAS NOT DIVIDED BY THE STROKE OF A CLOAK THAT THE BEARS DID NOT DESTROY CHILDREN FOR LAUGHING AT A PROPHET THAT A WANDERING SOOTHSAYER DID NOT COLLECT LIGHTNINGS FROM HEAVEN TO DESTROY THE LIVES OF INNOCENT MEN THAT HE DID NOT CAUSE RAIN AND MAKE IRON FLOAT THAT RAVENS DID NOT KEEP A HOTEL WHERE PREACHERS GOT BOARD AND LODGING FREE THAT THE SHADOW ON A DIAL WAS NOT TURNED BACK TEN DEGREES TO SHOW THAT A KING WAS GOING TO RECOVER FROM A BOIL THAT EZEKIEL WAS NOT TOLD BY GOD HOW TO PREPARE A DINNER THAT JONAH DID NOT TAKE CABIN PASSAGE IN A FISH--AND THAT ALL THE MIRACLES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT ARE NOT ALLEGORIES OR POEMS BUT
SOME QUERIES ABOUT THE DEVIL HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE HIS MANNER OF LIVING AND HIS OBJECT IN LIFE--INTERROGATORIES TO THE CLERGY--VII
INSOMUCH THAT MANY SAID HE IS DEAD THEN THE DISCIPLES ASKED JESUS WHY THEY COULD NOT CAST THEM OUT AND JESUS SAID
WHAT INTEREST HAD THEY IN THE BIRTH OF THE KING OF THE JEWS
THE TEACHER THE MOTHER SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST
ALL THE AVENUES ARE FILLED WITH MEN STRUGGLING FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE SAME THING
CREDULITY WAS REGARDED AS A VIRTUE
WHY DOES HE ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE THEIR PRISON
A MAN HAS COMMITTED MURDER HAS BEEN TRIED CONVICTED AND CONDEMNED TO DEATH
IT IS THE BRAIN THAT HEARS
MURDER UNIVERSAL
IF THEIR CONGREGATIONS ARE RICH THEY TURN THEIR GUNS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS BEEN BORN BUT ONCE TO COMPREHEND OR TO IMAGINE THE EXISTENCE OF THREE BEINGS EACH OF WHOM IS EQUAL TO THE THREE
IGNORANCE POVERTY AND VICE ARE POPULATING THE WORLD
IT COULD BE CURED BY PRAYERS--GIFTS AMULETS AND CHARMS
AND YET ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX IN THAT CITY DIES IN A HOSPITAL A WORKHOUSE OR A PRISON
ALL THE GOLD NOW KNOWN COINED AND IN BULLION DOES NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH MORE THAN THE SUM COLLECTED BY DAVID
HE WAS TAUGHT TO BELIEVE AND TO DEFEND HIS BELIEF NOT ONLY AGAINST ARGUMENT BUT AGAINST FACTS
THINK OF ONE OF THESE BEINGS AS THE FATHER OF ONE AND THINK OF THAT ONE AS HALF HUMAN AND ALL GOD AND THINK OF THE THIRD AS HAVING PROCEEDED FROM THE OTHER TWO AND THEN THINK OF ALL THREE AS ONE
LABOR WAS DESPISED AND A LABORER WAS CONSIDERED AS SCARCELY ABOVE THE BEASTS
IN NEARLY EVERY CITY OF THE UNITED STATES YOU WILL FIND THE FASHIONABLE PART AND THE POOR PART
THIS IN MY JUDGMENT IS REAL RELIGION
BEHOLD THY MOTHER AND THY BRETHREN STAND WITHOUT DESIRING TO SPEAK WITH THEE AND HE ANSWERED
NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE IS NO FIRMAMENT AND WE KNOW THAT THE WATERS ARE NOT DIVIDED BY A FIRMAMENT
MY DAUGHTER IS SORELY VEXED WITH A DEVIL ON ACCOUNT OF HER FAITH CHRIST MADE THE DAUGHTER WHOLE
IF FOURTEEN DINE TOGETHER THERE IS GREATER PROBABILITY IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONLY THE NUMBER OF A DEATH WITHIN THE YEAR THAN THERE WOULD BE IF ONLY THIRTEEN WERE AT THE TABLE
THERE IS NO INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT FORCE
WHEN LIFE IS DONE AN ENDLESS SLEEP MAY CLOSE OUR EYES A SLEEP WITH NEITHER DREAMS NOR SIGHS
THAT THESE SHEPHERDS VISITED MARY AND THE CHILD AND TOLD OTHERS WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND HEARD
THIS ENRICHED THE CHURCH
AND ALL THESE PRIESTS AND CLERGYMEN INSIST THAT THE BIBLE IS SUPERIOR TO HUMAN REASON--THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF MAN TO ACCEPT IT--TO BELIEVE IT WHETHER HE REALLY THINKS IT IS TRUE OR NOT AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST REGARD TO EVIDENCE OR REASON
ARE THE RICH ALWAYS TO BE DIVIDED FROM THE POOR,--NOT ONLY IN FACT BUT IN FEELING
ABOUT THE CLOSE OF THE 18TH CENTURY WATT ARKWRIGHT HARGREAVE CROMPTON CARTWRIGHT INVENTED THE STEAM ENGINE THE SPRING FRAME THE JENNY THE MULE THE POWER LOOM THE CARDING MACHINE AND A HUNDRED OTHER MINOR INVENTIONS AND PUT IT IN THE POWER OF ENGLAND TO MONOPOLIZE THE MARKETS OF THE WORLD
IS THAT THE BEST THAT WE ARE EVER TO KNOW
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TAUGHT THE DOGMA OF SPECIAL PROVIDENCE--THAT ALL EVENTS ARE ORDERED AND REGULATED BY GOD--THAT HE CROWNS AND UNCROWNS KINGS--PRESERVES AND DESTROYS--GUARDS AND KILLS--THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF MAN TO SUBMIT TO THE DIVINE WILL AND THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH EVIL THERE MAY BE--NO MATTER HOW MUCH SUFFERING--HOW MUCH PAIN AND DEATH MAN SHOULD POUR OUT-HIS HEART IN THANKFULNESS THAT IT IS NO WORSE
TRAITORS WERE HANGED AND QUARTERED OR DRAWN INTO FRAGMENTS BY HORSES
THAT HE GATHERED THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ASKED OF THEM WHERE CHRIST SHOULD BE BORN AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS TO BE BORN IN BETHLEHEM
HE LOVED THE SUBMISSIVE--THE KNEELERS AND CRAWLERS
THE AVERAGE FREIGHT CAR CARRIES ABOUT FIFTEEN TONS--DAVID'S GOLD AND SILVER WOULD LOAD ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE CARS MAKING A TRAIN ABOUT THIRTY-TWO MILES IN LENGTH
THEY THINK THAT THOSE NATIONS CREATED THEIR OWN DEVILS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THEY DID THEIR OWN GODS
WHO IS MY MOTHER AND WHO ARE MY BRETHREN THEN HE STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND TOWARD HIS DISCIPLES AND SAID
IS THERE A SUPERNATURAL POWER--AN ARBITRARY MIND--AN ENTHRONED GOD--A SUPREME WILL THAT SWAYS THE TIDES AND CURRENTS OF THE WORLD--TO WHICH ALL CAUSES BOW
A LITTLE WHILE AGO I DELIVERED A LECTURE ON SUPERSTITION IN WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS I SAID THAT THE CHRISTIAN WORLD COULD NOT DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
YOU PUT HIM IN STRIPES
FOR THE MOST PART THESE HAVE FAILED
I THANK THEM ALL--THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
I SEE THE INSANE PROPHETS READING THE SECRET BOOK OF FATE BY SIGNS AND DREAMS
THE HEART HARDENS AND THE BRAIN SOFTENS
THIS FRIGHTFUL POEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN A MADHOUSE
A MAN FINDS A WATCH AND IT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT HE CONCLUDES THAT IT MUST HAVE HAD A MAKER
CAN YOU REALIZE THE FACT THAT ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THE MOST SHOCKING SYSTEM OF SLAVERY--THE MOST BARBAROUS--EXISTED IN OUR COUNTRY AND THAT YOU AND I WERE BOUND BY THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TO STAND BETWEEN A HUMAN BEING AND HIS LIBERTY
AFTER THE DEATH OF THE GIANT CHARLEMAGNE EASILY CONQUERED THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND DIVIDED IT AMONG HIS SONS
NOW AN INTELLIGENT MAN CANNOT BELIEVE THAT A MIRACLE EVER WAS OR EVER WILL BE PERFORMED
HE HAS ALL
THERE IS NOTHING ORIGINAL IN CHRISTIANITY
IN A COUNTRY WHERE NO MAN IS ALLOWED TO PETITION FOR REDRESS THERE IS A REASON BUT NOT HERE
HUXLEY ENTERED THE LISTS FOR DARWIN
ALL THAT I HAVE SAID SEEMS TO BE TRUE--ALMOST SELF-EVIDENT,--AND YOU MAY ASK WHO IT IS THAT SAYS SLAVERY IS BETTER THAN LIBERTY
TAKE OUR OWN DEAR MERCIFUL PURITAN FATHERS
THE GOOD AND TRUE WILL BE TREASURED IN THE HEART
THEIR RELIGION WAS NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN MONSTERS WORSHIPING AN IMAGINARY MONSTER
THEY HAVE FED THEIR MINDS WITH MISTAKES MYSTERIES AND ABSURDITIES
COULD IT HAVE DONE THIS HAD IT ONLY BEEN A PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL
AMONG SAVAGES DO WE NOT FIND THAT THEIR VICES AND CRUELTIES ARE THE FRUITS OF THEIR SUPERSTITIONS
NATURE IS A MIRROR IN WHICH MAN SEES HIS OWN IMAGE AND ALL SUPERNATURAL RELIGIONS REST ON THE PRETENCE THAT THE IMAGE WHICH APPEARS TO BE BEHIND THIS MIRROR HAS BEEN CAUGHT
OR WHAT CAN WE THINK OF--FOR DO NOT IMAGINE THAT I THINK I KNOW
WHEN I BECAME CONVINCED THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL--THAT ALL THE GHOSTS AND GODS ARE MYTHS THERE ENTERED INTO MY BRAIN INTO MY SOUL INTO EVERY DROP OF MY BLOOD THE SENSE THE FEELING THE JOY OF FREEDOM
NOW WE KNOW THAT THE EARS DO NOT HEAR
WE DO NOT KNOW BY WHAT MEANS BEFORE THAT TIME HE MOVED FROM PLACE TO PLACE--WHETHER HE WALKED OR FLEW
IF WE ARE WHEN ASKED WHAT IS BEYOND THE HORIZON OF THE KNOWN WE MUST SAY THAT WE DO NOT KNOW
THEY HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN EDUCATION--IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN
HE WAS NOBLER THAN INSPIRED MEN GRANDER THAN PROPHETS GREATER AND PURER THAN APOSTLES
SANCTITY KEPT ITS ODOR
IN THE BRAIN OF SCIENCE THE DEVILS HAVE NEVER LIVED
AND YET WITH ALL THIS PRODUCTION WITH ALL THIS POWER TO CREATE THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS IN ABJECT WANT
HE SHOULD CARE NOTHING FOR AUTHORITY--NOTHING FOR NAMES CUSTOMS OR CREEDS--NOTHING FOR ANYTHING THAT HIS REASON DOES NOT SAY IS TRUE
THIS SLAVERY ABSOLUTELY EXISTED IN SCOTLAND UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE GLORIOUS 19TH CENTURY
A THANKSGIVING SERMON
A THANKSGIVING SERMON
MANY WAYS HAVE BEEN DEVISED SOME EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN TRIED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SOLVING THIS QUESTION
THE EARLY CHRISTIANS PROVED THAT CHRIST WAS DIVINE BECAUSE HE CAST OUT DEVILS
THIS IS NO COUNTRY FOR ANARCHY NO COUNTRY FOR COMMUNISM NO COUNTRY FOR THE SOCIALIST
AND THIS GOD ALSO KNEW WHEN HE CREATED THE DEVIL THAT HE GOD WOULD BE COMPELLED TO LEAVE HIS THRONE TO BE BOM A BABE IN PALESTINE AND TO SUFFER A CRUEL DEATH
WHAT IS RELIGION
WHAT IS RELIGION
THE FEUDAL LORDS WERE JEALOUS OF THE KING THE KING AFRAID OF THE LORDS THE CLERGY ALWAYS SIDING WITH THE STRONGER PARTY
IT IS FAR BETTER TO GIVE YOURSELF SOMETIMES TO NEGLIGENCE TO DRIFT WITH WAVE AND TIDE WITH THE BLIND FORCE OF THE WORLD TO THINK AND DREAM TO FORGET THE CHAINS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE BREATHING LIFE TO FORGET PURPOSE AND OBJECT TO LOUNGE IN THE PICTURE GALLERY OF THE BRAIN TO FEEL ONCE MORE THE CLASPS AND KISSES OF THE PAST TO BRING LIFE'S MORNING BACK TO SEE AGAIN THE FORMS AND FACES OF THE DEAD TO PAINT FAIR PICTURES FOR THE COMING YEARS TO FORGET ALL GODS THEIR PROMISES AND THREATS TO FEEL WITHIN YOUR VEINS LIFE'S JOYOUS STREAM AND HEAR THE MARTIAL MUSIC THE RHYTHMIC BEATING OF YOUR FEARLESS HEART
IN ALL HISTORICAL COMPOSITIONS THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE WANT OF COMMON HONESTY
DROP FOUR CIPHERS AND THE STORY BECOMES FAIRLY REASONABLE
IF IT OVERTAKES HIM GOOD
I SUPPOSE THAT WE SHOULD LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT ANY HUMAN BEING HAS BEEN INSPIRED
THIS IS REAL WORSHIP
THE BEST THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT CHRIST IS THAT NEARLY NINETEEN CENTURIES AGO HE WAS BORN IN THE LAND OF PALESTINE IN A COUNTRY WITHOUT WEALTH WITHOUT COMMERCE IN THE MIDST OF A PEOPLE WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE GREATER WORLD--A PEOPLE ENSLAVED CRUSHED BY THE MIGHTY POWER OF ROME
THEY SAY THAT CHRISTIANITY WAS ESTABLISHED PROVEN TO BE TRUE BY MIRACLES WROUGHT NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO
EACH VOTER IS A SOVEREIGN
IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR
TELL THEM THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHO WROTE THE GOSPELS AND TELL THEM THAT NO LINE ABOUT CHRIST WRITTEN BY A CONTEMPORARY HAS BEEN FOUND
ALTHOUGH OUR GOD WILL PUNISH YOU FOREVER IN ANOTHER WORLD--IN HIS PRISON--THE DOORS OF WHICH OPEN ONLY TO RECEIVE WE UNLESS YOU BELIEVE WILL TORMENT YOU NOW AND THEN THE MEMBERS OF THESE CHURCHES LED BY PRIESTS POPES AND CLERGYMEN SOUGHT OUT THEIR UNBELIEVING NEIGHBORS--CHAINED THEM IN DUNGEONS STRETCHED THEM ON RACKS CRUSHED THEIR BONES CUT OUT THEIR TONGUES EXTINGUISHED THEIR EYES FLAYED THEM ALIVE AND CONSUMED THEIR POOR BODIES IN FLAMES
GOD DID NOT REWARD MEN FOR BEING HONEST GENEROUS AND BRAVE BUT FOR THE ACT OF FAITH
THE MAN OF STRAW
HERE A DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE SICK AND THOSE WHO WERE POSSESSED BY EVIL SPIRITS
CERTAINLY THE LEFT-SHOULDER GLANCE COULD IN NO WAY AFFECT THE NATURE OF THINGS
WHEN EZRA FINISHED THE INSPIRED BOOK HE PLACED IT IN THE TEMPLE
ONLY A FEW--FOUR OR FIVE IN A CENTURY WERE SOUND IN HEART AND BRAIN
THE WHIPPING-POST WAS THEN AN INSTITUTION IN ENGLAND AS IT IS NOW IN THE ENLIGHTENED STATE OF DELAWARE
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE GOD HAD NEVER REVEALED HIMSELF TO THESE PEOPLE AND HE KNEW THAT WITHOUT A REVELATION THEY COULD NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS THE TRUE GOD
FEAR PRETENDS TO LOVE
AT HIS BIRTH THE GANGES WAS THRILLED FROM ITS SOURCE TO THE SEA AND ALL THE TREES THE DEAD AS WELL AS THE LIVING BURST INTO LEAF AND BUD AND FLOWER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE DEVOUT ORTHODOX AND IDIOTIC
EVERY CHILD SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO DOUBT TO INQUIRE TO DEMAND REASONS
THE DISEASED WERE CURED BY KISSING A BOX IN WHICH WAS KEPT SOME BONE OR RAG OR BIT OF WOOD SOME HOLY HAIRS PROVIDED THE KISS WAS PRECEDED OR FOLLOWED BY A GIFT--A SOMETHING FOR THE CHURCH
IF WORDS CONVEY ANY MEANING THE OLD TESTAMENT TEACHES THE EXISTENCE OF THE DEVIL
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE SCRIPTURES ARE COMPELLED TO SAY THAT THIS DEVIL WAS CREATED BY GOD AND THAT GOD KNEW WHEN HE CREATED HIM JUST WHAT HE WOULD DO--THE EXACT MEASURE OF HIS SUCCESS
HE FEELS CERTAIN THAT FLOODS WOULD DESTROY AND CYCLONES REND AND EARTHQUAKES DEVOUR
COULD SUCH A PROMISE BE REGARDED AS EVIDENCE
THEN ARISES THE QUESTION OF DIVORCE
EACH PERSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REACH HIS OWN CONCLUSIONS AND TO SPEAK HIS HONEST THOUGHT
IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE SKINS OF BEASTS AND SO FAR AS WE KNOW THERE WAS BUT ONE
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN--THEY ARE INVISIBLE--AND THEY HAVE NOT VENTURED WITHIN THE HORIZON OF THE SENSES
WE HAVE NO MASTER ON THE LAND NO KING IN AIR WITHOUT A MANACLE WE STAND WITHOUT A PRAYER WITHOUT A FEAR OF COMING NIGHT WE SEEK THE TRUTH WE LOVE THE LIGHT
NONE BUT THE INTELLIGENT AND HONEST CAN REALLY READ THIS BOOK
CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR DOUBTS--TO DEMAND REASONS
PROFITS MAY BE DESTROYED BY COMPETITION
TO INFLICT AN INJURY UPON YOURSELF IS AN ACT OF SELF-DENIAL
ABOUT THIS THERE CAN BE NO HONEST DIFFERENCE
IT WILL GIVE US PHILOSOPHERS THINKERS AND SAVANTS INSTEAD OF PRIESTS THEOLOGIANS AND SAINTS
HIS NAME DISPELLED THE DARKNESS OF DEATH AND FILLED THE DUNGEON WITH LIGHT
BY THIS TIME HE SHOULD BE SATISFIED THAT WORSHIP HAS NOT CREATED WEALTH AND THAT PROSPERITY IS NOT THE CHILD OF PRAYER
FROM HIS MOTHER'S ARMS HE GOES TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
TAUGHT THAT MONKS ARE PURER THAN FATHERS THAT NUNS ARE HOLIER THAN MOTHERS THAT FAITH IS SUPERIOR TO FACT THAT CREDULITY LEADS TO HEAVEN THAT DOUBT IS THE ROAD TO HELL THAT BELIEF IS BETTER THAN KNOWLEDGE AND THAT TO ASK FOR EVIDENCE IS TO INSULT GOD
THIS DEVIL ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE KNOWS THAT HE IS TO BE DEFEATED
MAN IN A SAVAGE STATE RELIES UPON HIS STRENGTH AND DECIDES FOR HIMSELF WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG
THE THEOLOGY TAUGHT BY MILTON WAS DEAR TO THE PURITAN HEART
HE DISCARDED THE IDEA THAT ALL LANGUAGE COULD BE TRACED TO AN ORIGINAL ONE
BUT THE ANGELS COME NO MORE
THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT CHRISTIANS
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF THE SONG OF SOLOMON
THE LIGHT STILL SHINES AND WILL AS LONG AS MAN LOVES LIBERTY AND SEEKS FOR TRUTH
IS IT POSSIBLE TO THINK OF AN INFINITE BEING
FOR AN ANGEL WENT DOWN AT A CERTAIN SEASON INTO THE POOL AND TROUBLED THE WATER
AMONG THE GREEKS THE TITANS WERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GODS
ON THE DOOR OF LIFE THEY HUNG THE CRAPE OF DEATH
NEITHER MENDICANTS NOR MILLIONAIRES ARE THE HAPPIEST OF MANKIND
LET EVERY ONE TAKE INTELLIGENT THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW
NOW THERE IS NO POSSIBLE RELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER AND THE DIGESTION OF EACH BETWEEN THE NUMBER AND THE INDIVIDUAL DISEASES
THERE IS NO NEED OF MY LIVING LONGER WHEN I STAIN WITH MY LIFE THE ONE I LOVE AND YET WE CALL OUR SOCIETY CIVILIZED
THEY CONSOLE THEMSELVES WITH LEGENDS AND MYTHS HAVE FAITH IN FICTION AND FORGERY--GIVE THEIR HEARTS TO GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND SEEK THE AID OF THE NON-EXISTENT
THE REAL QUESTION IS CAN WE PREVENT THE IGNORANT THE POOR THE VICIOUS FROM FILLING THE WORLD WITH THEIR CHILDREN
IT IS NO ANSWER TO SAY THAT THIS DEVIL WAS ONCE AN ANGEL OF LIGHT AND FELL FROM HIS HIGH ESTATE BECAUSE HE WAS FREE
TO CAP THE CLIMAX ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THIS BOOK WAS PROMOTED FOR HAVING WRITTEN AN AUTHENTIC HISTORY OF HIS COUNTRY
WITH MALICIOUS HAND HE SOWED THE SEEDS OF DOUBT--INDUCED MEN TO INVESTIGATE TO REASON TO CALL FOR EVIDENCE TO RELY UPON THEMSELVES
BETTER TO HAVE NO GOD THAN GOD AND DEVIL
THERE MAY BE SUCH A PLACE AS HELL--BUT IF THERE IS YOU NEVER CAN MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT IT'S ANY WORSE THAN OLD VERMONT SO THEY TOLD OF A MAN WHO COMPARED HIMSELF WITH HIS DOG
THE SCHEME WE HAVE ALSO THE SCHEME OF REDEMPTION
HE WAS BACK OF ALL CAUSE
THE SCHEME OF REDEMPTION--THROUGH THE ATONEMENT--IS IMMORAL AND SENSELESS
THEY CONNECTED CONTINENTS WITH CABLES CITIES AND TOWNS WITH THE TELEGRAPH--BROUGHT THE WORLD INTO ONE FAMILY--MADE INTELLIGENCE INDEPENDENT OF DISTANCE
WE KNOW NOW THAT ECLIPSES COME AT CERTAIN TIMES AND THAT THEIR COMING CAN BE EXACTLY FORETOLD
FOR CENTURIES IT KEPT THE EARTH FLAT FOR CENTURIES IT MADE ALL THE HOSTS OF HEAVEN TRAVEL AROUND THIS WORLD--FOR CENTURIES IT CLUNG TO SACRED KNOWLEDGE AND FOUGHT FACTS WITH THE FEROCITY OF A FIEND
HOW THEN DID THE EGYPTIANS REPRESENT THE STARS IN THE POSITION THEY OCCUPIED TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE FLOOD
JUST AS LIFE BECOMES COMPLEX AND AS EVERYONE IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN OBJECTS ALL THE INGENUITY OF THE BRAIN IS AT WORK TO GET THERE BY A SHORTER WAY AND IN CONSEQUENCE THIS HAS BECOME AN AGE OF INVENTION
GEOLOGISTS HAVE DIVIDED A FEW YEARS OF THE WORLDS HISTORY INTO PERIODS REACHING FROM THE AZOIC ROCKS TO THE SOIL OF OUR TIME
HIS GOSPEL HAS BEEN CARRIED BY MILLIONS TO ALL PARTS OF THE GLOBE AND HIS STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE SELF-DENYING AND FAITHFUL TO COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF THE SONS OF MEN
EVERY ONE IS A PIOUS FRAUD
SO A HOG AND SIX PIGS WERE TRIED FOR HAVING KILLED AND PARTIALLY EATEN A CHILD THE HOG WAS CONVICTED AND EXECUTED BUT THE PIGS WERE ACQUITTED ON THE GROUND OF THEIR EXTREME YOUTH
THE WORLD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF MAGIC
MINE AND MINE FOREVER WHAT JOY
PALESTINE IN ITS PALMIEST DAYS COULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED TWO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WE ASK YET NOTHING SEEMS TO KNOW
HOWBEIT THIS KIND GOETH NOT OUT BUT BY PRAYER AND FASTING FROM THIS IT WOULD SEEM THAT SOME PERSONIFICATIONS WERE EASIER TO EXPEL THAN OTHERS
THE THEOLOGICAL CHRIST--SAYINGS OF A CONTRADICTORY CHARACTER--CHRIST A DEVOUT JEW--AN ASCETIC--HIS PHILOSOPHY--THE ASCENSION--THE BEST THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT CHRIST--THE PART THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND GLORIOUS--THE OTHER SIDE--VI
LET HIM DO WHAT HE CAN IN THE CIRCLE OF HIS OWN ACQUAINTANCE TO RESCUE THE FALLEN TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP THEMSELVES TO GIVE WORK TO THE IDLE
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT DEATH IS NOT THE END BUT THE BEGINNING OF PUNISHMENT THAT HAS NO END
IN EVERY ORTHODOX PULPIT STOOD A TRADUCER OF THE GREATEST OF SCIENTISTS--OF ONE WHO FILLED THE WORLD WITH INTELLECTUAL LIGHT
DOCTORS WERE THE RIVALS OF PRIESTS
REMEMBER THE INQUISITION
WE ARE ALSO INFORMED THAT WHEN HEROD HEARD THESE THINGS HE WAS TROUBLED AND ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM
IT IS ETERNAL
THEY ASK NO ONE TO THINK--TO INVESTIGATE
THE CHURCH OPPOSED INOCULATION--VACCINATION AND THE USE OF CHLOROFORM AND ETHER
AND NOTHING IS PERMANENTLY SETTLED IN THIS WORLD THAT HAS NOT FOR ITS CORNER-STONE JUSTICE AND IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE PROFOUND CONVICTION OF THE HUMAN MIND
HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT SUCCEED
UPON THE ALTAR OF THIS FOLLY MILLIONS OF LIVES WERE SACRIFICED AND YET THE SOLDIERS OF THE IMPOSTOR WERE VICTORIOUS AND THE WRETCHES WHO CARRIED THE BANNER OF CHRIST WERE SCATTERED LIKE LEAVES BEFORE THE STORM
THEY RIDICULE AND CALUMNIATE THE GREAT THINKERS
THEY MADE OUR GOD SOMEWHAT LIKE THEMSELVES AND GAVE TO HIM THEIR PASSIONS THEIR IDEAS OF RIGHT AND WRONG
IT GAVE US A DEVIL CUNNING MALICIOUS ALMOST THE EQUAL OF GOD NOT QUITE AS STRONG--BUT QUICKER--NOT AS PROFOUND--BUT SHARPER
THE EGYPTIANS WERE ASTRONOMERS
SO IF LUKE TELLS THE TRUTH JOSEPH BEING WARNED BY AN ANGEL FLED FROM THE HATRED OF HEROD TEN YEARS AFTER HEROD WAS DEAD
IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE CHIEFS KINGS EMPERORS AND QUEENS
EMPLOYERS ARE SUPPOSED TO PAY ACCORDING TO THEIR PROFITS
AND THE EGG HAVING BEEN PRODUCED IN COURT THE ROOSTER WAS DULY CONVICTED AND HE TOGETHER WITH HIS MIRACULOUS EGG WERE PUBLICLY AND WITH ALL DUE SOLEMNITY BURNED IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE
BUT WE NOW NO LONGER SEEK FOR THE ELIXIR OF LIFE AND NO ONE IS TRYING TO FIND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
SO IS THE 36TH CHAPTER OF ISAIAH FROM THE 2ND VERSE THE SAME AS THE 18TH CHAPTER OF 2ND KINGS FROM THE 2ND VERSE
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE CRIMINAL
THE DEVIL ALSO TOOK HIM TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD AND OFFERED THEM ALL TO HIM IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS WORSHIP
THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION IN WHICH I TAKE GREAT INTEREST AND IT OUGHT IN MY JUDGMENT TO BE ANSWERED BY THE INTELLIGENCE AND KINDNESS OF OUR CENTURY
BOTH OF THESE ACCOUNTS CANNOT BE TRUE
WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH THEE JESUS THOU SON OF GOD
THE BLACK DEATH WAS SENT BY THE ETERNAL FATHER WHOSE MERCY SPARED SOME AND WHOSE JUSTICE MURDERED THE REST
THE CONGREGATIONS WILL BE CIVILIZED--INTELLECTUALLY HONEST AND HOSPITABLE
I BELIEVE WITH ROBERT BURNS
MYSTERY EVERYWHERE
THE HISTORY OF CHARLEMAGNE WAS WRITTEN BY TURPIN THE ARCHBISHOP OF RHEIMS AND RECEIVED THE FORMAL APPROBATION OF THE POPE
THEOLOGY IS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF EVIDENCE
FOR MY PART I WOULD AS SOON BE A WIDOW AS THE BRIDE OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN DEAD FOR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
BY THE LIGHT OF REASON WE DIVIDE THE USEFUL FROM THE HURTFUL THE FALSE FROM THE TRUE
IF THOU WILT WORSHIP ME ALL SHALL BE THINE WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT WHEN THE DEVIL HAD ENDED ALL THE TEMPTATION HE DEPARTED FROM HIM FOR A SEASON
THEREUPON GOD TOOK UPON HIMSELF FLESH WAS BORN INTO THE WORLD--WAS KNOWN AS CHRIST--WAS MURDERED SACRIFICED BY THE JEWS AND BECAME AN ATONEMENT FOR THE SINS OF THE HUMAN RACE
THESE WITCHES WERE BURNED FOR CAUSING DISEASES--FOR SELLING THEIR SOULS AND FOR SOURING BEER
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTS ANY MORE THAN FOR THEIR DREAMS
MAYBE THAT ADAM AND EVE WERE NOT DRIVEN OUT OF THE GARDEN
CONFRONTED WITH THE UNIVERSE WITH FIELDS OF SPACE SOWN THICK WITH STARS WITH ALL THERE IS OF LIFE THE WISE MAN BEING ASKED THE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF ALL REPLIES
OF COURSE THE CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE IS NOT THE REAL MARRIAGE
THE SACRIFICE OF DIOGENES TO ALL THE GODS THIS PARODIED THE WORSHIP OF THE WORLD--SATIRIZED ALL CREEDS AND IN ONE ACT PUT THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION
I CANNOT HARMONIZE ALL THESE CONTRADICTIONS--THESE BLESSINGS AND AGONIES--WITH THE EXISTENCE OF AN INFINITELY GOOD WISE AND POWERFUL GOD
THOSE WHO PREVENT OR TRY TO PREVENT THE EXPRESSION OF HONEST THOUGHT ARE THE FOES OF CIVILIZATION--THE ENEMIES OF TRUTH
FOR INSTANCE IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT AT ONE TIME THERE LIVED IN EUROPE AND IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS SOME OF THE MOST GIGANTIC MAMMALS THE MAMMOTH THE WOOLLY-HAIRED RHINOCEROS THE IRISH ELK ELEPHANTS AND OTHER FORMS THAT HAVE IN THOSE COUNTRIES BECOME EXTINCT
I ADMIT THAT THE DEVILS AS WELL AS THE GODS WERE NATURALLY PRODUCED--THE EFFECT OF NATURE UPON THE HUMAN BRAIN
SO I READ HENRY AND MACKNIGHT AND FOUND THAT GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO DAMN A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE
THEY DID NOT REASON OR INVESTIGATE
IT IS TRUE THAT IN A GREAT DEGREE WE HAVE ATONED FOR THIS NATIONAL CRIME
THE ROAR AND MURMUR OF THE RESTLESS SEA THE CATARACT'S SOLEMN CHANT THE THUNDER'S VOICE THE HAPPY BABBLE OF THE BROOK THE WHISPERING LEAVES THE THRILLING NOTES OF MATING BIRDS THE SIGHING WINDS TAUGHT MAN TO POUR HIS HEART IN SONG AND GAVE A VOICE TO GRIEF AND HOPE TO LOVE AND DEATH
THAT A RAG FROM A WANDERING BEGGAR IS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE FROM A SAINT AND THAT THE HAIR OF A HORSE WILL CURE DISEASE JUST AS QUICKLY AND SURELY AS THE HAIR OF A MARTYR
HUNDREDS OF LIKE INSTANCES COULD BE GIVEN AS THE WAR WAGED BETWEEN DEMONS AND PRIESTS WAS LONG AND BITTER
WHERE DID YOU GET THE OLD TESTAMENT
IF THY RIGHT HAND OFFEND THEE CUT IT OFF ONE SAID UNTO HIM
ALL SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL--THAT THE MAN WHO BOWS BEFORE AN IDOL OF WOOD OR STONE IS JUST AS FOOLISH AS THE ONE WHO PRAYS TO AN IMAGINED GOD,--THAT ALL WORSHIP HAS FOR ITS FOUNDATION THE SAME MISTAKE--THE SAME IGNORANCE THE SAME FEAR--THAT IT IS JUST AS FOOLISH TO BELIEVE IN A PERSONAL GOD AS IN A PERSONAL DEVIL--JUST AS FOOLISH TO BELIEVE IN GREAT GHOSTS AS LITTLE ONES
VOLNEY GIBBON AND THOMAS PAINE--VOLTAIRE'S SERVICES TO LIBERTY--PAGANS COMPARED WITH PATRIARCHS--VII
WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVELIHOOD
THAT WORD ADDS AN INFINITE HORROR TO DEATH AND MAKES THE CRADLE AS TERRIBLE AS THE COFFIN
AT THIS POINT ABSURDITY HAVING REACHED ITS LIMIT NOTHING MORE CAN BE SAID EXCEPT
BLAME THE SYSTEM
THERE ARE OF COURSE SOME CASES THAT HAVE TO BE TREATED WITH WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED ALMOST CRUELTY
DON'T LET HIM TALK LIKE A BANKER BECAUSE HE IS A BANKER
I THANK LAMARCK AND DARWIN--DARWIN WHO REVOLUTIONIZED THE THOUGHT OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD
LIKE VAMPIRES THEY HAVE SUCKED THEIR BLOOD
CONFINE THE WATER TO THE SPRINGS THE RIVULETS WOULD CEASE TO MURMUR THE RIVERS TO FLOW AND THE OCEAN ITSELF WOULD BECOME A DESERT OF SAND
PLENTY OF WISDOM AND OLD SAWS--BUT NO GREEN CORN
THAT FLOWERS WOULD GIVE THEIR PERFUME TO THE AIR AND LIGHT WOULD PAINT THE SEVEN-HUED ARCH UPON THE DUSKY BOSOM OF THE CLOUD IF EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS UNCONSCIOUS DUST
AND MAYBE THE CHERUBIM PLACED AT THE GATE OF EDEN WITH FLAMING SWORDS WERE ONLY PERSONIFICATIONS OF POLICEMEN
WHERE IS THIS HEAVEN
HE TOUCHES THE SPRINGS
TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THESE IMPS OF DARKNESS IS TO CONTRADICT THE WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST
FORCE CANNOT EXIST APART FROM MATTER
TEACH YOUR SON THAT IT IS HIS DUTY NOT ONLY BUT HIS HIGHEST JOY TO BECOME A HOME-BUILDER A HOME-OWNER
EVERY ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO READ FOR HIMSELF THAT HE MAY PREPARE HIMSELF TO LIVE AND TO DIE STILL HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WE CALL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
IN PHILADELPHIA PAINE WAS EMPLOYED TO WRITE FOR THE PENNSYLVANIA MAGAZINE
THE INVENTORS HAVE HELPED MORE THAN ANY OTHER CLASS TO MAKE THE WORLD WHAT IT IS
THEY INSISTED THAT CHRISTIANITY WAS NOT A GROWTH--NOT AN EVOLUTION--BUT A REVELATION
THEY KNEW THAT SATAN WAS THEIR KING
WE NOW KNOW THAT IN MECHANICS THE NATURAL IS SUPREME
AND IT IS FROM THE SURPLUS PRODUCED BY LABOR THAT SCHOOLS ARE BUILT THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE FOUNDED AND ENDOWED
THEY HAVE NOT CUNNING ENOUGH INTELLECT ENOUGH MUSCLE ENOUGH--THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MAKING OR DEVELOPING OF HIS CHARACTER
WHEN GOD MADE THESE DIFFERENT RACES HE KNEW THAT THE SUPERIOR WOULD ENSLAVE THE INFERIOR KNEW THAT THE INFERIOR WOULD BE CONQUERED AND FINALLY DESTROYED
AND STRAIGHTWAY COMING UP OUT OF THE WATER HE SAW THE HEAVENS OPENED AND THE SPIRIT LIKE A DOVE DESCENDING UPON HIM
CAUSES ARE BARREN OF EFFECTS AND EFFECTS ARE INDEPENDENT OF ALL NATURAL CAUSES
BUT DO NOT GO WITH ANYTHING THAT IS NOT GOING YOUR WAY
THIS RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN SHOULD BE USED NOT ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PERSON WISHING A HOME BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TYCHO BRAHE ANOTHER ASTRONOMER WHO HAS BEEN AND IS CALLED THE PRINCE OF ASTRONOMERS--NOT ONLY BELIEVED IN ASTROLOGY BUT ACTUALLY KEPT AN IDIOT IN HIS SERVICE WHOSE DISCONNECTED AND MEANINGLESS WORDS HE CAREFULLY WROTE DOWN AND THEN PUT THEM TOGETHER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO MAKE PROPHECIES AND THEN HE PATIENTLY AND CONFIDENTLY AWAITED THEIR FULFILLMENT
AND EVERY CHRISTIAN COUNTRY MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS NO ROBBERY TO TAKE THE PROPERTY OF MOHAMMEDANS AND NO MURDER TO KILL THE OWNERS WITH OR WITHOUT JUST CAUSE OF QUARREL
ENJOY THE FREEDOM OF A GOD AND HAVE THE GOODNESS AND THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS YOUR HONEST THOUGHT WHY SHOULD WE PURSUE THE TRUTH
IT MAY BE THAT THE MECHANICS THE WORKINGMEN WILL FINALLY BECOME INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO REALLY UNITE TO ACT IN ABSOLUTE CONCERT
THE MONARCH OF THE SKIES WILL BE DETHRONED--THE FLAMES OF HELL WILL BE EXTINGUISHED
IT MAY BE ASKED HOW I KNOW THAT THE DEVIL KNEW THAT CHRIST WAS GOD
ALL THIS IS TRUE AND IF IT WERE ALL HOW BEAUTIFUL HOW TOUCHING HOW GLORIOUS IT WOULD BE
A GREAT MANY CLERGYMEN ANSWERED OR CRITICISED THIS STATEMENT
AND THE CHURCH HAS DONE THIS BECAUSE IT REGARDED THIS LIFE AS A PERIOD OF PROBATION--A TIME TO PREPARE--TO BECOME SPIRITUAL--TO OVERCOME THE NATURAL--TO FIX THE AFFECTIONS ON THE INVISIBLE--TO BECOME PASSIONLESS--TO SUBDUE THE FLESH--TO CONGEAL THE BLOOD--TO FOLD THE WINGS OF FANCY--TO BECOME DEAD TO THE WORLD--SO THAT WHEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE GOD YOU WOULD BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE MADE YOU
NOT CONTENT WITH MERELY DRIVING HIM FROM HIS HOME THEY PURSUED HIM ABSOLUTELY TO THE GRAVE WITH A MALIGNITY THAT INCREASED RATHER THAN DIMINISHED
IT IS AND THEN I THOUGHT
ACCORDING TO ONE ACCOUNT HE WAS SEEN AFTER HIS RESURRECTION ONLY BY A FEW WOMEN AND HIS DISCIPLES
THAT ALL THE HEATHEN WILL BE LOST
BUT WE MUST NOT EXPECT THE INSPIRED TO BE ACCURATE
THIS WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION
YET MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE THIS JOURNEY JOHN SAYS THAT CHRIST SAID SPEAKING TO THE TWELVE DISCIPLES
COUNTLESS ALTARS AND TEMPLES HAVE BEEN BUILT AND THE SUPERNATURAL HAS BEEN WORSHIPED WITH SACRIFICE AND SONG WITH SELF-DENIAL CEREMONY THANKFULNESS AND PRAYER
THE MAN WHO WILL NOT THINK IS TRAITOR TO HIMSELF
SCHOOLS WHERE PRIESTS WERE MADE--WHERE THEY WERE TAUGHT TO HATE REASON AND TO LOOK UPON DOUBTS AS THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE DEVIL
YET IN SPITE OF MY SURROUNDINGS OF MY EDUCATION I HAD NO LOVE FOR GOD
AGAIN I ASK
HE KNOWS THAT HE HAS THE SYMPATHY OF ALL THE TRULY GOOD AND HE HOPES THAT HIS NAME WILL BE GRATEFULLY REMEMBERED IN THE FAR FUTURE AND ABOVE ALL HE HOPES TO WIN THE APPROVAL OF A JUST GOD
NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE FAR BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE OF A TOWN HAVING A POPULATION OF FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND TO HAVE ONE CHURCH AND THE EDIFICE SHOULD BE OF USE NOT ONLY ON SUNDAY BUT ON EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK
IT HAS FREED THE SLAVE CLOTHED THE NAKED FED THE HUNGRY LENGTHENED LIFE GIVEN US HOMES AND HEARTHS PICTURES AND BOOKS SHIPS AND RAILWAYS TELEGRAPHS AND CABLES ENGINES THAT TIRELESSLY TURN THE COUNTLESS WHEELS AND IT HAS DESTROYED THE MONSTERS THE PHANTOMS THE WINGED HORRORS THAT FILLED THE SAVAGE BRAIN
NOW WE KNOW THAT THE INSPIRED WRITERS DID NOT KNOW AND THAT THE GOD WHO INSPIRED THEM DID NOT KNOW
BELIEFS SUPERSTITIONS THEORIES SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE DEMONSTRATED FACTS
NOTHING EVER WAS NOTHING EVER CAN BE MORE PERFECTLY IDIOTIC AND ABSURD THAN THE DOGMA OF THE TRINITY
THE MAN OF STRAW PUT THE PLASTER OF SILENCE ON THE LIPS OF PROF BRIGGS AND HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE THE CHURCH OR REMAIN DUMB
AND THESE SAME FATHERS--THEOLOGIANS AND COMMENTATORS--SAID
OUR FATHERS THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD CAME FROM SOME OTHER REALM
PLOW CAN WE LESSEN CRIME?--FRIGHTFUL LAWS FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF MINOR CRIMES--A PENITENTIARY SHOULD BE A SCHOOL--PROFESSIONAL CRIMINALS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO POPULATE THE EARTH--V
IN THAT TERRIBLE PERIOD THE PEOPLE WHO HAD BORNE THE YOKE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS RISING FROM THE DUST CASTING THEIR SHACKLES FROM THEM FIERCELY AVENGED THEIR WRONGS
THEY FORGOT FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND GAVE THEIR LOVE TO THE INVISIBLE
KEPLER ANNOUNCED HIS THREE LAWS
THE SAME MEN HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THE VERDICT OF GUILTY AND THE SENTENCE OF THE COURT AND THE SAME MEN RETURN AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE PRISON CELL
IN IT YOU FIND ALL THE CRIES AND GROANS AND SHRIEKS OF MANIACS WHEN THEY TEAR AND REND EACH OTHER'S FLESH
CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION
CONCLUSION
HE SPAKE OF JUDAS ISCARIOT FOR IT WAS HE THAT SHOULD BETRAY HIM WHY DID CHRIST A YEAR AFTERWARD TELL JUDAS THAT HE SHOULD SIT ON A THRONE AND JUDGE ONE OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL
THERE WERE NO NATURAL CAUSES BEHIND EVENTS
EVERY PROFESSOR BREATHES THE AIR OF INSINCERITY
WHAT DID HE CREATE THEM FOR
THEY KNEW THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT GOD CURSED THE MAN AND WOMAN
THE SAME MAY BE SAID IN REGARD TO MARK LUKE AND JOHN
IT WAS FEARED THAT HIS DUST MIGHT CORRUPT THE BODIES OF THOSE WHO HAD PERSECUTED HIM
WHEN HE TOOK THE PAW OUT OF HIS POCKET IT HAD CHANGED TO A HUMAN HAND AND HIS WIFE SAT IN THE HOUSE WITH ONE OF HER HANDS GONE AND THE STUMP OF HER ARM BLEEDING
OUR BELIEFS LIKE THE FASHION OF OUR GARMENTS DEPEND ON WHERE WE WERE BORN
WE LOVE OUR FELLOW-MAN OUR KIND WIFE CHILD AND FRIEND
THE OUTCASTS THE DESERTED THE FALLEN FELT THAT CHRIST WAS THEIR FRIEND FELT THAT HE KNEW THEIR SORROWS AND PITIED THEIR SUFFERINGS
IF WE SAY YES THEN I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
THAT THERE IS A PLACE CALLED PURGATORY THAT THERE IS NO SUCH PLACE
I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE MORE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE COMBINED HAS AMELIORATED THE CONDITION OF MANKIND
IS THERE ANY INTELLIGENCE BACK OF NATURE
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO TEACH AS THE BASIS OF ALL PROGRESS ARE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL
THE HISTORIES WERE ALL WRITTEN BY THE MONKS AND BISHOPS ALL OF WHOM WERE INTENSELY SUPERSTITIOUS AND EQUALLY DISHONEST
WE HAVE FOSSIL FACTS AND LIVING FORMS
THE EVIDENCE THEY OFFERED WAS MORE ABSURD THAN THE STATEMENT THEY SOUGHT TO PROVE
THAT HE INTERFERES IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN
II
II
II
II
II
II
II
II
THEY WERE PERSECUTED AND TORMENTED
NO ONE HAS ANSWERED--NO ONE WILL ANSWER HIS ARGUMENT AGAINST THE DOGMA OF INSPIRATION--HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE BIBLE
THEY WERE NOT ACTUATED BY LOVE--BUT BY HATE AND FEAR
OF GOVERNMENT
SUPPOSE THAT AN INFINITE GOD EXISTS WHAT CAN WE DO FOR HIM
DID THE ANGEL PUT MEDICINE IN THE WATER--JUST ENOUGH TO CURE ONE
IN 1543 COPERNICUS PUBLISHED HIS BOOK ON THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES HE HAD SOME IDEA OF THE VASTNESS OF THE STARS--OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SPACES--OF THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS WORLD
THEY HAVE GIVEN THEIR SILVER THEIR GOLD THEIR GEMS
BECAUSE A PERFECTLY CIVILIZED MAN CAN NEVER BE PERFECTLY HAPPY WHILE THERE IS ONE UNHAPPY BEING IN THIS UNIVERSE
THEN HE WAS BORN INTO THE WORLD PREACHED FOR THREE YEARS AND ALLOWED SOME SAVAGES TO KILL HIM
THE OLD TESTAMENT
THE NEW TESTAMENT--DISCREPANCIES ABOUT THE BIRTH OF CHRIST--HEROD AND THE WISE MEN--THE MURDER OF THE BABES OF BETHLEHEM--WHEN WAS CHRIST BORN--CYRENIUS AND THE CENSUS OF THE WORLD--GENEALOGY OF CHRIST ACCORDING TO MATTHEW AND LUKE--THE SLAYING OF ZACHARIAS--APPEARANCE OF THE SAINTS AT THE CRUCIFIXION--THE DEATH OF JUDAS ISCARIOT--DID CHRIST WISH TO BE CONVICTED?--III
THAT THE HOLY GHOST HAD THE FORM OF A DOVE
THEY HAVE GIVEN US THE INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC AND THE GREAT COMPOSERS AND PERFORMERS HAVE CHANGED THE COMMON AIR TO TONES AND HARMONIES THAT INTOXICATE EXALT AND PURIFY THE SOUL
BE HONEST
THEY WERE ZEALOUS AND SINCERE
ALL IS NATURALLY PRODUCED
THEY ROBBED WAR OF HALF ITS TERRORS
THEY COULD NOT HAVE DOUBLED MORE THAN FOUR TIMES A CENTURY
DON'T LET HIS CLASS BRIBE HIM
SUPPOSE WE HAD A MAN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO COULD CONTROL THE WIND THE RAIN AND LIGHTNING AND SUPPOSE WE ELECTED HIM TO GOVERN THESE THINGS AND SUPPOSE THAT HE ALLOWED WHOLE STATES TO DRY AND WITHER AND AT THE SAME TIME WASTED THE RAIN IN THE SEA
THEY ARE TOO CRUEL TOO MERCILESS TOO SAVAGE
WHEN A MAN WHO LOVED JEHOVAH WANTED REVENGE ON HIS ENEMY HE FELL ON HIS HOLY KNEES AND FROM A HEART FULL OF RELIGION HE CRIED
THE PHYSICIANS THE SURGEONS RELY ON OBSERVATION EXPERIMENT AND REASON
IS IT EVER TO REMAIN AS IT IS NOW
BUT SAY THE CHRISTIANS WE HAVE THE ONLY INSPIRED BOOK
NO MAN HAS GENIUS ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE AGONIES THAT HAVE BEEN INFLICTED ON INNOCENT MEN AND WOMEN BECAUSE OF THIS ABSURD BELIEF
CAN INFINITE WISDOM AND POWER MAKE ANY EXCUSE FOR THE CREATION OF FAILURES
A WOMAN DROPS A CLOTH WITH WHICH SHE IS WASHING DISHES AND SHE EXCLAIMS
WHERE DID THE ANGEL COME FROM
EVERY LIBRARY IS AN ARSENAL AND EVERY TRUTH IS A MONITOR IRON-CLAD AND STEEL-PLATED
IT SHOULD ASK THAT ALL THE FACULTIES OF THE MIND ALL THE SENSES SHOULD ASSEMBLE AND TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AND THAT ITS CLAIMS BE PASSED UPON AND TESTED WITHOUT PREJUDICE WITHOUT FEAR IN THE CALM OF PERFECT CANDOR
HE KNOWS THAT FRIDAYS AND THURSDAYS ARE ALIKE
IT DOES NOT DESIRE THE WORSHIP OF THE IGNORANT OR THE PRAYERS AND PRAISES OF THE FRIGHTENED
THEN COMES REGRET REPENTANCE SORROW CONSCIENCE
WHY WERE THEY SO WICKED
I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING AGAINST RELIGION
THAT THEY ARE ALL GOING TO HEAVEN
1886 PRAYER OF KING LEAR--WHEN HONESTY WEARS A RAG AND RASCALITY A ROBE-THE NONSENSE OF FREE MORAL AGENCY DOING RIGHT IS NOT SELF-DENIAL-WEALTH OFTEN A GILDED HELL--THE LOG HOUSE--INSANITY OF GETTING MORE--GREAT WEALTH THE MOTHER OF CRIME--SEPARATION OF RICH AND POOR--EMULATION--INVENTION OF MACHINES TO SAVE LABOR--PRODUCTION AND DESTITUTION--THE REMEDY A DIVISION OF THE LAND--EVILS OF TENEMENT HOUSES--OWNERSHIP AND USE--THE GREAT WEAPON IS THE BALLOT--SEWING WOMEN--STRIKES AND BOYCOTTS OF NO AVAIL--ANARCHY COMMUNISM AND SOCIALISM--THE CHILDREN OF THE RICH A PUNISHMENT FOR WEALTH--WORKINGMEN NOT A DANGER--THE CRIMINALS A NECESSARY PRODUCT--SOCIETY'S RIGHT TO PUNISH--THE EFFICACY OF KINDNESS--LABOR IS HONORABLE--MENTAL INDEPENDENCE
MR PARKHURST DENOUNCES THE APOSTLES AS WORTHLESS CRAVENS
THE PRESENT IS THE CHILD AND THE NECESSARY CHILD OF ALL THE PAST AND THE MOTHER OF ALL THE FUTURE
ALL THINGS EQUAL IN WONDER
THEREUPON THE PHARISEES SAID
WHEN JESUS SENT HIS DISCIPLES FORTH ON THE GREAT MISSION TO CONVERT THE WORLD AMONG OTHER THINGS HE TOLD THEM TO HEAL THE SICK TO RAISE THE DEAD AND TO CAST OUT DEVILS
THE SAVAGE WAS CONTROLLED BY APPEARANCES BY IMPRESSIONS
IF GOD CREATED MAN--IF HE IS THE FATHER OF US ALL WHY DID HE MAKE THE CRIMINALS THE INSANE THE DEFORMED AND IDIOTIC
HE HATED THE DOUBTERS THE INVESTIGATORS THE THINKERS THE PHILOSOPHERS
YOUR FIRST DUTY IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES AND IF THERE IS A SURPLUS WITH THAT SURPLUS HELP YOUR FELLOW-MAN
SO I BELIEVE THE EMPLOYER IS GRADUALLY BECOMING CIVILIZED GRADUALLY BECOMING KINDER
THERE IS ONE TRUTH HOWEVER THAT YOU MUST NOT FORGET AND THAT IS THAT EVERY EVIL TENDS TO CORRECT AND ABOLISH ITSELF
ONLY A FEW IN SPITE OF THE ROAR AND DIN IN SPITE OF THE SAVAGE CRIES HEARD REASON'S VOICE
IN HELL
AND WHILE I LIVE I AM GOING TO DO WHAT LITTLE I CAN TO HELP MY FELLOW-MEN WHO HAVE NOT BEEN AS FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN
THE HOPE OF ANOTHER LIFE WAS IN THE HEART LONG BEFORE THE SACRED BOOKS WERE WRITTEN AND WILL REMAIN THERE LONG AFTER ALL THE SACRED BOOKS ARE KNOWN TO BE THE WORK OF SAVAGE AND SUPERSTITIOUS MEN
I WOULD HAVE THE LAW SO THAT ANY HUSBAND COULD OBTAIN A DIVORCE WHEN THE WIFE HAD PERSISTENTLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATED THE CONTRACT
WITH FIRE AND SWORD SHE EXTERMINATED THE MEN WHO THOUGHT
THEY MUST BE BELIEVED
NO MATTER WHETHER YOU CLAIM A SLAVE BY PURCHASE OR CAPTURE THE TITLE IS BAD
THEY SAY THAT HE IS THE CREATOR AND PRESERVER OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN--OF ALL THAT IS--OF ALL THAT WILL BE--THAT HE IS THE FATHER OF ANGELS AND DEVILS THE ARCHITECT OF HEAVEN AND HELL--THAT HE MADE THE EARTH--A MAN AND WOMAN--THAT HE MADE THE SERPENT WHO TEMPTED THEM MADE HIS OWN RIVAL--GAVE VICTORY TO HIS ENEMY--THAT HE REPENTED OF WHAT HE HAD DONE--THAT HE SENT A FLOOD AND DESTROYED ALL OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EIGHT PERSONS--THAT HE TRIED TO CIVILIZE THE SURVIVORS AND THEIR CHILDREN--TRIED TO DO THIS WITH EARTHQUAKES AND FIERY SERPENTS WITH PESTILENCE AND FAMINE
EVERY FLOWER THAT GIVES ITS FRAGRANCE TO THE WANDERING AIR LEAVES ITS INFLUENCE ON THE SOUL OF MAN
ACCORDING TO THIS SCHEME BY THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HUMAN NATURE BECAME EVIL CORRUPT AND DEPRAVED
THERE IS NOT A MAN IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK WITH GENIUS ENOUGH WITH BRAINS ENOUGH TO OWN FIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BEYOND THIS JOY CANNOT GO
I SEE THEM FALL FROM VAGUE AND MISTY THRONES HELPLESS AND DEAD
MINISTERS OUGHT TO BE FREE
AT FIRST THEY SAID THAT IF THE FACTS AS CLAIMED WERE TRUE THE BIBLE WAS FALSE AND CHRISTIANITY ITSELF A SUPERSTITION
AND HERE ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT THE MINISTERS WHO ARE ANSWERING ME ARE TURNING THEIR GUNS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
HOW LONG HAS MAN BEEN UPON THE EARTH
SUCH PEOPLE SHOULD NOT POPULATE THE EARTH
4 OF 12 BY ROBERT G
NOW NO INTELLIGENT MAN BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF A DEVIL--NO LONGER FEARS THE LEERING FIEND
A PENTITENTIARY SHOULD BE A SCHOOL
IN THE FIRST PLACE I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE AND I WOULD NOT TAKE AN INCH OF LAND FROM ANY HUMAN BEING THAT BELONGED TO HIM
HUNDREDS OF CREEDS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED FROM ITS INSPIRED PASSAGES
THE LAST LINK HAS BEEN FOUND
VOLTAIRE LIGHTED A TORCH AND GAVE TO OTHERS THE SACRED FLAME
THEY WERE ASSAULTED IN THE CRADLE--IN THEIR MOTHER'S ARMS
A MAN BLESSED WITH SO MUCH COMMON SENSE THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNCOMMON MAN OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED
PREJUDICE CLOUDS AND DARKENS EVERY PAGE
I HAD NO DESIRE TO BE CONVERTED DID NOT WANT A NEW HEART AND HAD NO WISH TO BE BORN AGAIN BUT I HEARD ONE SERMON THAT TOUCHED MY HEART THAT LEFT ITS MARK LIKE A SCAR ON MY BRAIN
THEY WANT THE TRUTH--THE ACTUAL FACTS
WHILE ON THE CONTRARY HE MAY BE FAR BETTER ABLE TO SUCCEED THAN WHEN HE MARRIED HER
IF YOU WISH TO BETTER THE CONDITION OF A PEOPLE MORALLY BETTER THEM PHYSICALLY
PROFIT-SHARING WOULD NOT WORK BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SHARE PROFITS WITH THOSE WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF SHARING LOSSES
THAT ALL THE ACTIONS OF MEN WERE PREDESTINED--PREORDAINED FROM ETERNITY AND YET THAT MAN IS FREE
WERE THE ANGELS WHO ROLLED AWAY THE STONE AND SAT CLOTHED IN SHINING GARMENTS IN THE EMPTY SEPULCHER OF CHRIST A COUPLE OF PERSONIFICATIONS
IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A MAN COULD BE HEALTHY WITHOUT BEING A CATHOLIC
WHAT DOES HE SAY
JEREBOAM HAD AN ARMY OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ABIJAH OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND
IT WAS DECLARED TO BE A SIN A CRIME FOR A WOMAN TO LESSEN THE PANGS OF MOTHERHOOD
THEY DENIED THAT IT WAS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY NATURAL RELIGION
WHEN CYCLONES REND--WHEN LIGHTNING BLIGHTS TIS NAUGHT BUT FATE
POSSIBLY THESE SUPERSTITIONS ARE TRUE BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE--WE BELIEVE IN THE NATURAL--SCIENCE IS THE REAL REDEEMER
WE KNOW THAT THIS CAN BE DONE BY INCREASING KNOWLEDGE BY DEVELOPING THE BRAIN
THE PARTIES WERE REGARDED AS WORLDLY AND THE BALLS AS WICKED
INGERSOLL BY ROBERT G
MENTAL VERACITY IS A CRIME COWARDICE AND HYPOCRISY ARE VIRTUES
LET US TAKE ANOTHER STEP
LET US TAKE ANOTHER STEP
LET US TAKE ANOTHER STEP
LET US TAKE ANOTHER STEP
LET US TAKE ANOTHER STEP
CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IN INFINITE TORTURE IN ETERNAL PAIN
THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY FORCE PHYSICAL OR MORAL
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE HISTORY OF THE LONG AND SEEMINGLY HOPELESS WAR WAGED FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING FILLED WITH HORROR AND DISGUST
SUPERSTITION
SUPERSTITION
GREAT WEALTH IS THE MOTHER OF CRIME
THE MEN OF SCIENCE ARE BELIEVERS IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE
MADE PRIESTS FORGET THEIR VOWS
IGNORANCE IS THE MOTHER OF MYSTERY AND MISERY OF SUPERSTITION AND SORROW OF WASTE AND WANT
BY THEIR TEACHINGS THOUSANDS BECOME INSANE
THE FIRST WAS AGAINST SLAVERY THE SECOND AGAINST DUELLING THE THIRD ON THE TREATMENT OF PRISONERS--SHOWING THAT THE OBJECT SHOULD BE TO REFORM NOT TO PUNISH AND DEGRADE--THE FOURTH ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN AND THE FIFTH IN FAVOR OF FORMING SOCIETIES FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN AND ANIMALS
THE TELEPHONE WAS INVENTED--THE TELEPHONE THAT CARRIES AND DEPOSITS IN LISTENING EARS THE WAVES OF WORDS
IT DESTROYED SO FAR AS IT COULD THE BEST LITERATURE OF THE WORLD
WHAT EFFECT UPON LIBBY SAULSBURY AND ANDERSONVILLE
I ADMIT THAT THE WORLD HAS ACTED AS IT MUST
THEY SHOULD ATTACK THE GEOLOGISTS
THE BOOKS DO NOT AGREE EITHER IN FACTS OR PHILOSOPHY
IT ENSLAVED NATIONS AND SHED THE BLOOD OF COUNTLESS THOUSANDS
THE DEVILS HAVE GONE AND WITH THEM THEY HAVE TAKEN THE MIRACLES OF CHRIST
ON EVERY SIDE ARE THE BENEVOLENT AND MALICIOUS--SOMETHING TOILING TO PRESERVE SOMETHING LABORING TO DESTROY
YET ACCORDING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT CHRIST DID NOT KNOW THAT ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES WAS TO BETRAY HIM
HE IT IS WHO HAS GOVERNED AND STILL GOVERNS THE WORLD
GOD OFFERED THE REWARDS OF ETERNAL JOY AND THREATENED ETERNAL PAIN
IT IS OUR DUTY TO ACT JUSTLY HONESTLY BUT IT CANNOT BE OUR DUTY TO LOVE
SATAN PRINCE OF WITCHES AND MAGICIANS
THE EVIDENCE OF THE CHURCH
THE HOLY GHOST IS NEITHER FATHER NOR SON BUT BOTH
FROM THE CHRISTIAN'S POINT OF VIEW NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN THAT EVENT
AN ORCHESTRA FORMED MUSIC CULTIVATED
THEY TOOK CARE OF THOSE WHO CARRIED AMULETS AND CHARMS OF THOSE WHO REPEATED PRAYERS AND COUNTED BEADS OF THOSE WHO FASTED AND PERFORMED CEREMONIES
OUR LIFE IS JOYOUS JOCUND FREE NOT ONE A SLAVE WHO BENDS IN FEAR THE TREMBLING KNEE AND SEEKS TO SAVE A COWARD SOUL FROM FUTURE PAIN
AFTER A TIME THOSE ENGAGED IN THE SLAVE-TRADE WERE DECLARED PIRATES
HE IS HONEST
HE COULDN'T EVEN PLAY BILLIARDS WITH ALL HIS KNOWLEDGE NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF WOMAN'S RIGHTS OR UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE
IF WE WISH TO DO AWAY WITH WAR WE MUST PROVIDE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF NATIONAL DIFFERENCES BY AN INTERNATIONAL COURT
THEY SHOULD LAUNCH THEIR CURSES AT THE BLASPHEMING SEAS AND DASH THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE INFIDEL ROCKS
NO ONE PRETENDS THAT EGYPT EXISTED AS A NATION BEFORE THE FLOOD
THERE IS MUCH HOWEVER TO BE ACCOMPLISHED STILL
INTELLIGENCE IS THE ONLY LEVER CAPABLE OF RAISING MANKIND
YEARS SHOULD NOT BE DEVOTED TO THE ACQUISITION OF DEAD LANGUAGES OR TO THE STUDY OF HISTORY WHICH FOR THE MOST PART IS A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THINGS THAT NEVER OCCURRED
LET HIM TELL OF THE WONDROUS METAPHYSICS MYTHS AND RELIGIONS OF INDIA AND EGYPT
A THOUSAND WOMEN AND NOT A PIN IN THE HOUSE
MEN BEGAN TO SEE THAT THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE WERE NOT SUBJECT TO INTERFERENCE
THAT THEY WERE JUST AS SURE ABOUT HELL AS HEAVEN
SO IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY THAT IT IS DANGEROUS FOR THIRTEEN PEOPLE TO DINE TOGETHER
THAT THE STARS WOULD SHINE
THE PRESENT IS THE NECESSARY PRODUCT OF ALL THE PAST THE NECESSARY CAUSE OF ALL THE FUTURE
THE LOW THE IGNORANT THE CONTEMPTIBLE CULTIVATED THE SOIL
SEE THOU TO THAT THEN JUDAS THREW DOWN THE PIECES OF SILVER AND WENT AND HANGED HIMSELF
JOHN KNOX WAS ONLY IN FAVOR OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WHEN HE WAS IN THE MINORITY AND BAXTER ENTERTAINED THE SAME SENTIMENT
THE SUPERNATURAL BEGAN TO BE ABANDONED AND MANKIND ENDEAVORED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL PHYSICAL PHENOMENA BY PHYSICAL LAWS
PETER SAYS THAT HE FELL DOWN AND BURST ASUNDER
CHILDREN THUS TAUGHT--THUS CORRUPTED AND DEFORMED--BECOME THE ENEMIES OF INVESTIGATION--OF PROGRESS
NO ONE IS HAPPIER IN A PALACE THAN IN A CABIN
THEY WERE ONLY INTELLIGENT AND HONEST MEN
HAVE MERCY ON ME O LORD THOU SON OF DAVID
THERE WOULD BE TWO MURDERS INSTEAD OF ONE TWO INNOCENT MEN KILLED ONE BY THE FIRST MURDERER AND ONE BY THE STATE AND THE REAL MURDERER FREE
IF WE THANK HIM FOR VICTORY WE SHOULD THANK HIM FOR DEFEAT
HE MUST HAVE THE MEANS BY WHICH HE CHANGES FORCE TO WHAT WE CALL THOUGHT
THE GEOLOGIST IN ROCKS AND DEPOSITS AND MOUNTAINS AND CONTINENTS READ A LITTLE OF THE STORY OF THE WORLD--OF ITS CHANGES OF THE GLACIAL EPOCH--THE STORY OF VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL LIFE
ONE SUNDAY I WENT WITH MY BROTHER TO HEAR A FREE WILL BAPTIST PREACHER
OF THIS PLANET MAN IS A NATIVE
FULTON GAVE TO THE WORLD THE STEAMBOAT AND COMMERCE BECAME INDEPENDENT OF THE WINDS
IT SHEDS NO INTELLECTUAL LIGHT
AND AFTER HE MUST BE LOOSED A LITTLE SEASON IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW ONE COULD BE CONFINED IN A PIT WITHOUT A BOTTOM AND HOW A CHAIN OF IRON COULD HOLD ONE IN ETERNAL FIRE OR WHAT USE THERE WOULD BE TO LOCK A BOTTOMLESS PIT
MATTHEW TELLS US THAT JESUS WAS LED UP OF THE SPIRIT INTO THE WILDERNESS TO BE TEMPTED OF THE DEVIL
THINK OF THE DAYS AND NIGHTS THAT LIE BETWEEN!--THINK OF THE CENTURIES THE WITHERED LEAVES OF TIME THAT STREW THE DESERT OF THE PAST
IF THE DEVIL SHOULD DIE WOULD GOD MAKE ANOTHER
IF CHRIST WAS NOT TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL THEN THE TEMPTATION WAS BOM IN HIS OWN HEART
THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS A PERPETUAL BATTLE WAGED BETWEEN THE GREAT POWERS OF GOOD AND EVIL FOR THE POSSESSION OF HUMAN SOULS
LET US SEE IF THESE WRITERS AGREE
PEOPLE WERE BURNED FOR CAUSING FROSTS IN THE SUMMER FOR DESTROYING CROPS WITH HAIL FOR CAUSING COWS TO BECOME DRY AND EVEN FOR SOURING BEER
CHILDREN SIX YEARS OLD HAD TO LABOR
THE REAL CHURCH THE REAL EDIFICE IS ADORNED AND GLORIFIED WITH ALL THAT ART HAS DONE
POSSIBLY THERE IS A PLACE CALLED HELL WHERE ALL THE DEVILS LIVE--A HELL WHOSE FLAMES ARE WAITING FOR ALL THE MEN WHO THINK AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO EXPRESS THEIR THOUGHTS FOR ALL WHO FAIL TO CREDIT PRIESTS AND SACRED BOOKS FOR ALL WHO WALK THE PATH THAT REASON LIGHTS FOR ALL THE GOOD AND BRAVE WHO LACK CREDULITY AND FAITH--BUT OF THIS I AM HAPPY TO SAY THERE IS NO PROOF
IN THE WINTER NAVIGATION HAVING CLOSED BUSINESS WAS MOSTLY SUSPENDED
THE MEN WHO INVENTED THE LOOMS AND SPINDLES THAT CLOTHE THE WORLD THE INVENTORS OF PRINTING AND THE GREAT PRESSES THAT FILL THE EARTH WITH POETRY FICTION AND FACT THAT SAVE AND KEEP ALL KNOWLEDGE FOR THE CHILDREN YET TO BE
WHAT OTHER
MANY OF THE BOOKS IN OUR BIBLE CONTRADICT EACH OTHER
ALL THIS HAS BEEN DONE BY THE WORLDLY--BY THOSE WHO WERE NOT CALLED OR SET APART OR FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST OR HAD THE SLIGHTEST CLAIM TO APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION THE MEN WHO ACCOMPLISHED THESE THINGS WERE NOT INSPIRED THEY HAD NO REVELATION--NO SUPERNATURAL AID
I COMPARED WHAT WAS REALLY KNOWN ABOUT THE STARS WITH THE ACCOUNT OF CREATION AS TOLD IN GENESIS
THE MASTER CANNOT BE GREAT ENOUGH TO MAKE SLAVERY SWEET
THE MASTER CANNOT BE GREAT ENOUGH TO MAKE SLAVERY SWEET
CASTALIO A PROFESSOR AT GENEVA IN SWITZERLAND WAS THE FIRST CLERGYMAN IN EUROPE WHO DECLARED THE INNOCENCE OF HONEST ERROR AND WHO PROCLAIMED HIMSELF IN FAVOR OF UNIVERSAL TOLERATION
IF THEY HAD THE POWER THEY WOULD PROHIBIT EVERYTHING THAT MEN AND WOMEN REALLY ENJOY
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS LET EVERY MAN SAY THAT THIS GOVERNMENT AND THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT SHALL STAND
THESE IDEAS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND NOW THE CHRISTIAN'S GOD IS THE INFINITE THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE THE FORMLESS BODILESS AND PASSIONLESS
A WOMAN WAS EXECUTED BECAUSE SHE ENDEAVORED TO ALLAY THE PAINS OF A FEVER BY SINGING
APOPLEXY WAS THE WORK OF AN UNCLEAN SPIRIT
I AM NOT A SOCIALIST
IN THOSE DAYS THE BEST EDUCATED AND THE MOST IGNORANT WERE EQUAL DUPES
BEYOND THE HORIZON OF OUR SENSES
ACCORDING TO THAT SAME BIBLE THERE WAS A FLOOD SOME FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AFTER ADAM WAS CREATED THAT DESTROYED THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EIGHT PERSONS AND ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE THE EGYPTIANS DESCENDED FROM ONE OF THE SONS OF NOAH
NEVER HEARD OF SUCCOTASH IN HIS WHOLE LIFE
IF YOU GRANT THEIR PREMISES YOU JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS
I HAD FOUND AT LAST A NATURAL MAN ONE WHO DESPISED HIS COUNTRY'S CRUEL CREED AND WAS BRAVE AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH TO SAY
TRUTH CIVILIZES ENNOBLES AND PURIFIES
THE 19TH AND 20TH CHAPTERS OF 2ND KINGS AND THE 37TH AND 38TH CHAPTERS OF ISAIAH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME
THIS TRADE HAS BEEN THE GREAT CRIME OF MODERN TIMES
IT IS ONLY EVIDENCE OF THE MUTUAL FLAMES THAT BURN WITHIN
THEY USED THEIR SENSES OBSERVED AND RECORDED FACTS
THEY LIVE ON THE LABOR OF OTHERS
IF THE DEVIL SHOULD DIE WOULD GOD MAKE ANOTHER?--HOW WAS THE IDEA OF A DEVIL PRODUCED--OTHER DEVILS THAN OURS--NATURAL ORIGIN OF THESE MONSTERS--II
ALL THIS POWER WILL I GIVE THEE AND THE GLORY OF THEM FOR THAT IS DELIVERED UNTO ME AND TO WHOMSOEVER I WILL I GIVE IT
EDUCATE THE CHILDREN
NOW IF THIRTEEN IS A DANGEROUS NUMBER TWENTY-SIX OUGHT TO BE TWICE AS DANGEROUS AND FIFTY-TWO FOUR TIMES AS TERRIBLE
UNDERSTAND I AM NOT BLAMING THESE PEOPLE
THEY WILL FILL HOMES WITH LIGHT AND JOY
DIOGENES MUST HAVE KNOW OF THIS INSPIRED PASSAGE--"WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SINS I COMPARED ZENO EPICURUS AND SOCRATES THREE HEATHEN WRETCHES WHO HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE OLD TESTAMENT OR THE TEN COMMANDMENTS WITH ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB THREE FAVORITES OF JEHOVAH AND I WAS DEPRAVED ENOUGH TO THINK THAT THE PAGANS WERE SUPERIOR TO THE PATRIARCHS--AND TO JEHOVAH HIMSELF
FOR THE PAST TO THEM WAS ONLY WRONG IMPOSITION AND OUTRAGE
HOW DOES LIE MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
CHRIST IS HIS OWN FATHER AND HIS OWN SON
HE WHO DOES NOT WANT DOES NOT ACT
BE HONEST TELL THE TRUTH
OTHER INVENTIONS RAPIDLY FOLLOWED
THE THEOLOGIAN SAYS THAT GOD GOVERNS THE WIND THE RAIN THE LIGHTNING
CAN PERSONIFICATIONS HAVE DESIRES
WE ARE NO LONGER MISLED BY MYTHS AND LEGENDS
THERE CAN BE NO MORE FAMINE
AND THEN I ASKED MYSELF
ALL THERE IS OF VALUE IN THE WORLD IS THE PRODUCT OF LABOR
TO KNOW THAT CHRIST DISPELLED THE DARKNESS OF DEATH AND FILLED THE GRAVE WITH ETERNAL LIGHT
IF THESE DEVILS DO NOT EXIST IF THEY DO NOT CAUSE DISEASE IF THEY DO NOT TEMPT AND MISLEAD THEIR VICTIMS THEN CHRIST WAS AN IGNORANT SUPERSTITIOUS MAN INSANE AN IMPOSTOR OR THE NEW TESTAMENT IS NOT A TRUE RECORD OF WHAT HE SAID AND WHAT HE PRETENDED TO DO
AND YET ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT WHEN SHE MET THE RISEN CHRIST HE SAID
MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN WERE DESTROYED BECAUSE THEY HAD SOLD THEMSELVES TO THE DEVIL
AND AT PRESENT IN THE WORLD OF TRADE THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND EXCEPT WHEN INTERFERED WITH BY CONSPIRACY ARE IN ABSOLUTE CONTROL
SHOULD WE THANK THE CHURCH
AND AS FOR MYSELF I GLORY IN THE FACT THAT UPON AMERICAN SOIL THAT PRINCIPLE WAS FIRST FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WAS THE FIRST OF ANY GREAT NATION IN WHICH RELIGIOUS TOLERATION WAS MADE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE LAND
WHEN PEOPLE READ THEY REASON WHEN THEY REASON THEY PROGRESS
ONE COUNTRY COULD NOT BE SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER AS NOW
THEY WERE TREATED AS REAL ESTATE AND PASSED WITH A DEED TO THE MINES IN WHICH THEY WORKED
IF THESE PERSONS HAD ACTUALLY ENTERED INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEVIL FOR THE PURPOSE OF INJURING THEIR NEIGHBORS THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN EXTERMINATING THEM ALL
WE KNOW THAT SOME EVIL CAN BE AVOIDED AND THAT THE GOOD CAN BE INCREASED
IF IT IS TRUE I HATE YOUR GOD FROM THAT DAY I HAVE HAD NO FEAR NO DOUBT
THE BARBARY STATES HELD WHITE CHRISTIANS IN SLAVERY IN THIS THE 19TH CENTURY
MANY PEOPLE REGARD FRIDAY AS AN UNLUCKY DAY--AS A BAD DAY TO COMMENCE A JOURNEY TO MARRY TO MAKE ANY INVESTMENT
AS A MATTER OF FACT THE NEW TESTAMENT IS FAR MORE EXPLICIT THAN THE OLD
HE SEES THE WEAK ENSLAVED--MOTHERS ROBBED OF BABES--THE INNOCENT IN DUNGEONS--ON SCAFFOLDS
THE MIND CANNOT BE SECURELY ANCHORED
NOTHING FOR CHARMS OR AMULETS
THEY FOUND THAT JEHOVAH WAS A TRIBAL GOD AND THAT HIS ANCESTORS HAD LIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES THE TIGRIS THE GANGES AND THE NILE AND THESE ANCESTORS WERE TRACED BACK TO STILL MORE SAVAGE FORMS
THE INSPIRED BIBLE HAS BEEN AND IS THE GREATEST CURSE OF CHRISTENDOM AND WILL SO REMAIN AS LONG AS IT IS HELD TO BE INSPIRED
THEY SUBMIT THE QUARREL TO ARBITRATORS AND COURTS
SOMEBODY HAS SAID THAT CHRIST CLAIMED THAT GOD WAS HIS FATHER AND THAT HE AND HIS FATHER WERE ONE
IN GERMANY MEN OFTEN HAZARDED THEIR FREEDOM ON THE THROWING OF DICE
THEIR BODIES THEIR LOW FOREHEADS WERE COVERED WITH HAIR
BUT THE PRINCIPLE GATHERING STRENGTH FROM THEIR WEAKNESS NOURISHED BY BLOOD AND FLAME RENDERED HOLIER STILL BY THEIR SUFFERINGS--GRANDER BY THEIR HEROISM AND IMMORTAL BY THEIR DEATH TRIUMPHED AT LAST AND IS NOW ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WHOLE CIVILIZED WORLD
HOPE IS THE CONSOLATION OF THE WORLD
THEY DID NOT REGARD MEN AS SLAVES TO BE RULED BY TORTURE BY LASH AND CHAIN NOR AS CHILDREN TO BE CHEATED WITH ILLUSIONS ROCKED IN THE CRADLE OF AN IDIOT CREED AND SOOTHED BY A LULLABY OF LIES
I SEE THEIR ALTARS MINGLE WITH THE COMMON EARTH THEIR TEMPLES CRUMBLE SLOWLY BACK TO DUST
ALL THIS WAS DONE BY THE DEVIL TO BRING REPROACH UPON HOLY MEN
THERE IS THE SAME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE THAT THERE IS BETWEEN A MADHOUSE AND A UNIVERSITY--BETWEEN A FORTUNE TELLER AND A MATHEMATICIAN--BETWEEN EMOTION AND PHILOSOPHY--BETWEEN GUESS AND DEMONSTRATION
NO MATTER WHAT THE DEAD HAVE SAID OR THE LIVING BELIEVE THEY SHOULD TELL WHAT THEY KNOW
FOR WHAT THEY DID WAS AT LEAST IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT AND ONE SUCCESSFUL STAND AGAINST THE CHURCH PRODUCED OTHERS ALL OF WHICH TENDED TO ESTABLISH UNIVERSAL TOLERATION
THERE HAD BEEN NO INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT
THEY TOLD US THAT BREAD BY MAKING CERTAIN MOTIONS AND MUMBLING CERTAIN PRAYERS COULD BE CHANGED INTO THE FLESH OF GOD AND THAT IN THE SAME WAY WINE COULD BE CHANGED TO HIS BLOOD
THEY ARE MAKERS OF BRICK WITHOUT STRAW
DEPART YE CURSED INTO EVERLASTING FIRE PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS THESE ARE THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LOVE NO HUMAN BEING HAS IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO CONCEIVE OF THIS INFINITE HORROR
WHEN HE THINKS HE USES FORCE FORCE THAT MUST BE REPLACED
ONE OF THE FOUNDATION STONES OF OUR FAITH IS THE OLD TESTAMENT
BUT PAINE WAS ONE OF THE PIONEERS--ONE OF THE TITANS ONE OF THE HEROES WHO GLADLY GAVE HIS LIFE HIS EVERY THOUGHT AND ACT TO FREE AND CIVILIZE MANKIND
HE HAS CAUSED THE SUN TO RISE ON THE GOOD AND ON THE EVIL AND HIS RAIN TO FALL ON THE JUST AND THE UNJUST
AND IT WAS DECLARED AT THAT TIME THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVED EITHER MORE OR LESS ON THAT SUBJECT THAN THAT BOOK CONTAINED WAS A HERETIC AND DESERVED TO BE EXTERMINATED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
I WAS NOT CONVINCED
NOTHING CAN THE HANDS AND FABRICS SERVICE OF CIVIL AND CRUMBLES OF ALL AND YET EVEN IN FREE AMERICA LABOR IS NOT HONORED AS IT DESERVES
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THE SAVAGE THAT DISEASES WERE NATURAL
ON ONE OCCASION HE PERSONATED A BISHOP--A BISHOP RENOWNED FOR HIS SANCTITY--ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DISCOVERED AND DRAGGED FROM THE ROOM OF A BEAUTIFUL WIDOW
THIS WAS A PIECE OF CHEESE OR BREAD OF ABOUT AN OUNCE IN WEIGHT WHICH WAS FIRST CONSECRATED WITH A FORM OF EXORCISM DESIRING THAT THE ALMIGHTY IF THE MAN WERE GUILTY WOULD CAUSE CONVULSIONS AND PALENESS AND THAT IT MIGHT STICK IN HIS THROAT BUT THAT IT MIGHT IF THE MAN WERE INNOCENT TURN TO HEALTH AND NOURISHMENT
COMMERCE BEGAN TO UNFOLD HER WINGS
HOW IS TRUTH TO BE FOUND
AT THE END OF THE TERM THEY ARE DISCHARGED HAVING ONLY ENOUGH MONEY TO RETURN TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY WERE SENT
THE PLAY IS A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE
EVERY MAN SHOULD GIVE TO ANOTHER ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY TO GIVE--AND ENOUGH THAT HE MAY MAKE HIS LIVING AND LAY SOMETHING BY FOR THE WINTER OF OLD AGE
IDLENESS WAS THE BADGE OF GENTLE BLOOD
THEY KNEW THAT GOD WAS DOING HIS BEST TO MAKE YOU TAKE THE PATH AND THAT THE DEVIL USED EVERY ART TO KEEP YOU IN THE ROAD
AS CHRISTIANS HAVE CHANGED THEIR GOD SO THEY HAVE ACCORDINGLY CHANGED THEIR BIBLE
THEY ARE THE BENEFACTORS OF OUR RACE
NOW SUPPOSE THAT EVERY MAN WERE TO HAVE ALL THE LAND HE IS ABLE TO BUY
THESE BOOKS ARE INDEPENDENT OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN REASON
I HAVE NO TIME TO PLAY
THE WRITERS OF THE BIBLE WERE MISTAKEN
THE CHRISTIANS SAY THAT THEIR GOD HAS EXISTED FROM ETERNITY
THEY GAVE US THE GAME OF CHESS
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE JEHOVAH MADE THE WORLD IN SIX DAYS AND THE WORK DONE EACH DAY IS DESCRIBED
I WILL TELL THEM WHY
BY THE INVENTIONS IN AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY THE UNITED STATES CAN FEED ALL THE MOUTHS UPON THE EARTH
IF ALL THE ACCOUNTS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT OF CASTING OUT DEVILS ARE FALSE WHAT PART OF THE BLESSED BOOK IS TRUE
THEY BEGAN TO LOOK AND LISTEN
THEY DROVE DOUBTS FROM THE MINDS OF THE PIOUS SOWED THE SEEDS OF CREDULITY AND FAITH SAVED SAINTS FROM THE WILES OF WOMEN PAINTED THE GLORIES OF HEAVEN FOR THOSE WHO FASTED AND PRAYED MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE REALLY GOOD TO DISPENSE WITH THE PLEASURES OF SENSE AND TO HATE THE DEVIL
WAS JESUS TEMPTED
THE GREAT LITERATURE OF OUR LANGUAGE IS PAGAN IN ITS THOUGHT--PAGAN IN ITS BEAUTY--PAGAN IN ITS PERFECTION
THEY WILL BE CLASPED WITH GLAD HANDS TO HAPPY BREASTS
THIS BELIEF IN THE DEVIL AND EVIL SPIRITS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR ANOTHER BELIEF
POSSIBLY IRON FLOATED RIVERS DIVIDED WATERS BURST FROM DRY BONES BIRDS CARRIED FOOD TO PROPHETS AND ANGELS FLOURISHED DRAWN SWORDS BUT OF THIS WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THEY ARE BLAMED DESPISED PUNISHED
HE WAS A LARGE MAN DRESSED LIKE A FARMER BUT HE WAS AN ORATOR
BUT YOU ARE ALL NO DOUBT PERFECTLY FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION
KNEW THAT BY REASON OF THIS DEVIL COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS WOULD SUFFER ETERNAL TORMENT IN THE PRISON OF PAIN
HE SENDS THE CYCLONE AND THEY ARE TORN AND MANGLED
THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THE HUMAN HEART WAS UTTERLY DEPRAVED SO THAT MAN BY NATURE WAS IN LOVE WITH WRONG AND HATED GOD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
NEITHER CAN WE EXPECT TO MAKE HUMAN BEINGS MANLY AND WOMANLY BY KEEPING THEM OUT OF TEMPTATION
UNDER THE SCHEME OF SALVATION THE DEVIL WAS A NECESSITY
MYRIADS OF MACHINES HAVE BEEN INVENTED--EVERY ONE OF THEM TO SAVE LABOR
THAT HE WAS THEN WHETTING THE SWORD OF HIS WRATH AND THAT THE PEOPLE COULD SAVE THEMSELVES ONLY BY OBEYING THE PRIESTS BY COUNTING THEIR BEADS AND DOUBLING THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS
THEY WERE SENSIBLE MEN
THEY SOWED THE SEEDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND MANY MILLIONS HAVE REAPED ARE REAPING AND WILL REAP THE HARVEST OF JOY
IN THE 6TH CENTURY A MONK BY THE NAME OF COSMAS WROTE A KIND OF ORTHODOX GEOGRAPHY AND ASTRONOMY COMBINED
HAVE THEY FORM AND SHAPE
IN A THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY IF A PROFESSOR FINDS A FACT INCONSISTENT WITH THE CREED HE MUST KEEP IT SECRET OR DENY IT OR LOSE HIS PLACE
THIS IS THE SCHEME OF REDEMPTION,--THE ATONEMENT
OUR FATHERS AGES AGO--FROM SAVAGERY TO CIVILIZATION--FOR THE BLESSINGS WE ENJOY WHOM SHOULD WE THANK?--WHAT GOOD HAS THE CHURCH DONE?-DID CHRIST ADD TO THE SUM OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE--THE SAINTS--WHAT HAVE THE COUNCILS AND SYNODS DONE?--WHAT THEY GAVE US AND WHAT THEY DID NOT--SHALL WE THANK THEM FOR THE HELL HERE AND FOR THE HELL OF THE FUTURE?--II
IT WILL NOT DO TO SAY THAT THE DEVILS WERE DISEASES OR PERSONIFICATIONS
IN THEIR SCHOOLS THEY TAUGHT THE MODERN DOCTRINES OF EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT THEY ANTICIPATED DARWIN AND SPENCER
THE EVIDENCE IN BOTH CASES IS THE SAME,--NONE IN EITHER
THE INVENTION OF POWDER HAD RELEASED MILLIONS FROM THE ARMY AND LEFT THEM TO PROSECUTE THE ARTS OF PEACE
IN THE ETERNAL DUNGEON WHERE THE SOULS OF MEN ARE TO SUFFER FOREVER
AND CONNECTED WITH IT SHOULD BE ROOMS FOR THE PLAYING OF GAMES BILLIARDS CARDS AND CHESS
NOTHING THAT TOUCHES THE FUTURE OF OUR RACE NOTHING THAT TOUCHES THE HAPPINESS OF OURSELVES OR OUR CHILDREN SHOULD BE BENEATH OUR NOTICE
SO BACK OF THE GOOD THEY PUT GOD
I THANK THE ARTISTS WHO CHISELED FORMS IN STONE AND WROUGHT WITH LIGHT AND SHADE THE FACE OF MAN
SO MINISTERS SAY THAT THEY TEACH CHARITY
ONE BY ONE HER COLONIES WERE LOST BUT SHE KEPT HER CREED
I PRAY THEE SEND LAZARUS THAT HE MAY DIP THE TIP OF HIS FINGER IN WATER AND COOL MY PARCHED TONGUE FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME OH MY HEARERS HE HAS BEEN MAKING THAT REQUEST FOR MORE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
A DIFFERENCE AS TO WHO SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PARTAKE OF THE LORD'S SUPPER
I WAS NO LONGER A SERVANT A SERF OR A SLAVE
NO MATTER WHETHER TAXES ARE LAID ON LUXURIES OR ON THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE LABOR PAYS EVERY CENT
I GAVE UP THE NEW TESTAMENT BECAUSE IT REWARDS CREDULITY AND CURSES BRAVE AND HONEST MEN AND BECAUSE IT TEACHES THE INFINITE HORROR OF ETERNAL PAIN
IN ENGLAND WILBERFORCE AND CLARKSON DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE-TRADE
YOU CANNOT FORM A CORRECT OPINION OF THOSE AGES WITHOUT READING THE STANDARD AUTHORS SO TO SPEAK OF THAT TIME THE LAWS THEN IN FORCE AND BY ASCERTAINING THE HABITS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE THEIR MODE OF ADMINISTERING THE LAWS AND THE IDEAS THAT WERE COMMONLY RECEIVED AS CORRECT
AND IT IS NOT ONLY THE LAW OF OUR COUNTRY BUT THE LAW IS SUSTAINED BY AN ENLIGHTENED PUBLIC OPINION
WE HAVE ADVANCED
SO THE PROMISE OF CHRIST TO REWARD THOSE WHO WILL BELIEVE IS A BRIBE
YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT CALVIN WAS ALONE IN THIS
IN SOME COUNTRIES MEN BEGAN TO INTEREST THEMSELVES IN SCIENCE BUT NOT IN SPAIN
HE MUST KNOW SOMETHING OF THE CAUSES OF DISEASE--OF THE CONDITIONS OF HEALTH
I AM NOT BLAMING THESE RICH MEN FOR BEING RICH
THAT IS TO SAY THEY MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT WE CALL ORGANIZED BEINGS NOW IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT PERSONIFICATIONS OF EVIL ARE DUMB OR DEAF
THAT THE CORPSE AROSE AND FELT UPON HIS SMILING LIPS THE KISS OF WIFE AND CHILD
A FEW YEARS AGO A FEW MEN BECAME WICKED ENOUGH TO USE THEIR SENSES
THEY MAY HAVE SUFFERED ONLY THE PERSONIFICATION OF EXILE
EVERY GOOD ORTHODOX MINISTER ASSERTS WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW AND DENIES WHAT HE DOES KNOW
IN THE GLOOM HE SEES THE EYES OF AN OGRE--EYES THAT FLAME WITH MALICE
I ADMIT THAT THE PRIESTS WERE HONEST--AS HONEST AS IGNORANT
HE OPENED FOR US THE GATES OF PARADISE AND MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO OBTAIN ETERNAL LIFE
THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE FAITH HAVE CRUMBLED AND FADED AWAY
POSSIBLY COMETS ECLIPSES AND SHOOTING STARS FORETELL THE DEATH OF KINGS THE DESTRUCTION OF NATIONS OR THE COMING OF PLAGUE
IT DOES NOT ASK MAN TO CRINGE OR CRAWL
THEN HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND WENT BACK TO HEAVEN
ACCORDING TO LUKE THERE WERE BETWEEN DAVID AND JESUS FORTY-TWO GENERATIONS AND HE GIVES ALL THE NAMES
A GIRL SUFFERING FROM HYSTERIA FALLS INTO A TRANCE--HAS VISIONS OF THE INFERNAL WORLD
IT BELIEVES IN THE DIVINE SLEIGHT-OF-HAND--IN THE PRESTO AND OPEN SESAME OF THE INFINITE
I READ SCOTT WHO WAS SUCH A NATURAL THEOLOGIAN THAT HE REALLY THOUGHT THE STORY OF PHAETON--OF THE WILD STEEDS DASHING ACROSS THE SKY--CORROBORATED THE STORY OF JOSHUA HAVING STOPPED THE SUN AND MOON
HERE THEY ARE TAUGHT THAT TO REALLY THINK IS WICKED
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE OF THEM EVER TRIED TO REFORM JERUSALEM ON THE PARKHURST PLAN
TO BELIEVE THAT MIND CREATED AND CONTROLS MATTER
HE HAS NEVER LEARNED ANYTHING
IN SPITE OF THE THREAT OF ETERNAL PAIN--OF THE PROMISE OF EVERLASTING JOY UNBELIEVERS INCREASED AND THE CHURCHES TOOK ANOTHER STEP
WHAT ECCLESIASTICAL COUNCIL HAS ADDED TO THE INTELLECTUAL WEALTH OF THE WORLD
TO STOP THE SCOURGE THEY TRIED TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF GOD BY KNEELINGS AND PROSTRATIONS--BY PROCESSIONS AND PRAYERS--BY BURNING INCENSE AND BY MAKING VOWS
ETERNAL PAIN
MEN SHOULD NOT BE SENT TO THE PENTITENTIARY AS A PUNISHMENT BECAUSE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT MEN DO AS THEY MUST
FOR THE WOMEN WHO LABOR FOR THEMSELVES AND CHILDREN
THE GREAT ORATORS WHO HAVE SWAYED THE WORLD THE COMPOSERS WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR SOULS TO SOUND THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY THE PRODUCERS THE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BATTLED FOR THE RIGHT THE VAST HOST OF USEFUL MEN--THESE ARE OUR CHRISTS OUR APOSTLES AND OUR SAINTS
IN EVERY WAY THE CLERGY SOUGHT TO EVADE THE FACTS TO DODGE THE TRUTH TO PRESERVE THE CREED
