THE TELESTIAL STATE IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FAILED TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT GIVEN THEM
THE CHARACTERISTIC UNITY SO MARKED IN CONNECTION WITH EVERY PHASE OF THE PEOPLE'S EXISTENCE PROMISED TOO MUCH
THESE ARE THE LAST DAYS OF WHICH THE PROPHETS IN ALL AGES HAVE SUNG
HE WAS UNJUSTLY CHARGED WITH FAVORING SECESSION
IT EXPECTS NO MORE CONSIDERATION AND SCARCELY HOPES FOR GREATER POPULARITY THAN WERE ACCORDED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH
IT CLAIMS A HIGHER RANK THAN THAT OF AN ORGANIZATION OF MEN PLANNED AND INSTITUTED BY THE WISDOM AND PHILOSOPHY OF MEN HOWEVER WORTHY
SALT LAKE CITY UTAH MARCH 1914
YET IT AFFIRMS THAT THE INFINITE WISDOM AND FORE-KNOWLEDGE OF GOD MAKES PLAIN TO HIM THE END FROM THE BEGINNING
NEVER EVEN FOR A MOMENT DID THEY QUESTION THE SUPREME AUTHORITY AND THE INSPIRED ORIGIN OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THEIR LAND
ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL--A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
BY SUCH REVELATION HE WAS GUIDED IN HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY
WHILE OREGON THEN CLAIMED BY GREAT BRITAIN INCLUDED WASHINGTON IDAHO AND PORTIONS OF MONTANA AND WYOMING
ANIMATE IT
NOR BRIGHT JEWELS OF THE MINE
STORIES WERE TOLD OF THE SHIFTS TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN PUT BY THE VICISSITUDES OF FAMINE
BUT SEE
THE SUFFERER WAS PARTIALLY PROTECTED BY SOMETHING LIKE A TENT MADE FROM A COUPLE OF BED SHEETS
AND THESE BORE DOWN UPON THE FIELDS AS THOUGH COMING TO COMPLETE THE DEVASTATION
IT WAS THE GENERAL CONVICTION THAT WAR WAS INEVITABLE AND IT WAS DECIDED TO RESIST TO THE LAST
WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE BOOK OF MORMON OPPOSITION GREW MORE INTENSE TOWARD THE PEOPLE WHO PROFESSED A BELIEF IN THE TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH
MASON AS MILITARY COMMANDANTS OF CALIFORNIA SPOKE IN HIGH PRAISE OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND IN THEIR OFFICIAL REPORTS DECLARED THAT THEY HAD MADE EFFORTS TO PROLONG THE BATTALION'S TERM OF SERVICE
AND GOLD WAS VALUABLE ONLY AS IT REPRESENTED A MEANS OF OBTAINING THESE
BUT THAT INASMUCH AS THE CHANGE WE CALL DEATH DOES NOT TRANSFORM THE CHARACTER OF THE SOUL REPENTANCE THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM WHO HAS RUTHLESSLY AND WILLFULLY REJECTED THE MANIFOLD OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED HIM FOR REPENTANCE HERE
NO GREAT ACCUMULATION OF THE DUST OF TIME WAS ON FLOORS OR FURNITURE
IT IS A SURPRISING FACT THAT WHILE GROWTH PROGRESS ADVANCEMENT DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWN TRUTHS AND THE ACQUISITION OF NEW ONES CHARACTERIZE EVERY LIVING SCIENCE THE SECTARIAN WORLD HAS DECLARED THAT NOTHING NEW MUST BE EXPECTED AS DIRECT REVELATION FROM GOD
FOLLOWING BAPTISM BY WATER COMES THE ORDINANCE OF THE BESTOWAL OF THE HOLY GHOST BY THE AUTHORIZED IMPOSITION OF HANDS WHICH CONSTITUTES THE TRUE BAPTISM OF THE SPIRIT
COLONEL COOKE REPORTED TO THE COMMANDANT THAT HALF HIS HORSES HAD PERISHED THROUGH COLD AND LACK OF FOOD
HE WAS A MAN WITH CLEAR TITLE AS ONE OF THE SMALL BROTHERHOOD WE CALL GREAT
THIS MAN AT ONCE WARRIOR PROPHET AND HISTORIAN HAD MADE A TRANSCRIPT AND COMPILATION OF THE HETEROGENEOUS RECORDS THAT HAD ACCUMULATED DURING THE TROUBLED HISTORY OF THE NEPHITE NATION
ALREADY VERSIONS HAVE APPEARED IN SWEDISH MODERN GREEK AND RUSSIAN
FOR THE SECOND COMING OF THE REDEEMER PREPARATION IS DEMANDED OF MEN
EXPERIENCES WERE COMPARED AS TO THE JOURNEYINGS ON THE PLAINS
THE SCRIPTURES ARE SILENT AS TO A SINGLE DISPENSATION IN WHICH THE SPIRITUAL LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE DEPENDED UPON THE RECORDS OF EARLIER TIMES AND BY-GONE AGES FOR THEIR GUIDANCE
WITHIN A FEW HOURS AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE VANGUARD UPON THE BANKS OF WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS CITY CREEK--THE MOUNTAIN STREAM WHICH TODAY FURNISHES SALT LAKE CITY PART OF HER WATER SUPPLY--PLOWS WERE PUT TO WORK
BUT IT AFFIRMS THAT NONE BUT ADAM IS OR SHALL BE ANSWERABLE FOR ADAM'S DISOBEDIENCE
THE BLACKSMITH'S FORGE WAS COLD BUT THE SHOP LOOKED AS THOUGH THE OCCUPANT HAD JUST GONE OFF FOR A HOLIDAY
THE FIRST IS STILL STANDING THOUGH NO LONGER POSSESSED BY THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT IT
BRIGHAM YOUNG WAS STILL GOVERNOR OF UTAH AND THE MILITIA WAS SUBJECT TO HIS ORDER
THE BOOK OF MORMON RECOUNTS THE MERCIES AND JUDGMENTS OF GOD THE INSPIRED TEACHINGS OF HIS PROPHETS THE RISE AND FALL OF HIS PEOPLE AS ORGANIZED COMMUNITIES ON THE WESTERN CONTINENT
MORMONISM EMPHASIZES THE DOCTRINE THAT THAT WHICH IS CAESAR'S BE GIVEN UNTO CAESAR WHILE THAT WHICH IS GOD'S BE RENDERED UNTO HIM
THE LAST WRITER IN THE ANCIENT RECORD AND THE ONE WHO HID AWAY THE PLATES IN THE HILL CUMORAH WAS MORONI--THE SAME PERSONAGE WHO APPEARED AS A RESURRECTED BEING IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY A DIVINELY APPOINTED MESSENGER SENT TO REVEAL THE DEPOSITORY OF THE SACRED DOCUMENTS
A GENERAL APOSTASY FROM THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH IS CONCEDED IN EFFECT BY SOME AUTHORITIES IN ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY
HE WROTE A ROMANCE TO WHICH NO NAME OTHER THAN MANUSCRIPT STORY WAS GIVEN AND WHICH BUT FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE WRITER'S NAME AND THE MISREPRESENTATION OF HIS MOTIVES WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED
THEIR GATHERING IS TO BE LIKE THAT OF THE JEWS AT JERUSALEM--A PACIFIC ONE AND IN THEIR TAKING POSSESSION OF WHAT THEY REGARD AS A LAND OF PROMISE NO ONE PREVIOUSLY LOCATED THERE SHALL BE DENIED HIS RIGHTS
336 PP BUT THIS LABOR FOR THE DEAD IS TWO-FOLD
A SINGLE SCENE OF THE BLOODY DRAMA IS KNOWN AS THE HAUN'S MILL MASSACRE
AND THAT HE CAN READ IN THE NATURES AND DISPOSITIONS OF HIS CHILDREN THEIR DESTINY
THE PRINCIPAL COMPANY WAS LED BY ONE LEHI DESCRIBED AS A PERSONAGE OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND WEALTH WHO HAD FORMERLY LIVED AT JERUSALEM IN THE REIGN OF ZEDEKIAH AND WHO LEFT HIS EASTERN HOME ABOUT 600 B.C
THE SOLEMN STYLE OF THE BOOK OF MORMON IN IMITATION OF THE ENGLISH SCRIPTURES DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE MANUSCRIPT
WITH AN EXPERIENCE OF SUFFERING THAT WOULD HAVE WELL SERVED A BETTER CAUSE THIS PICKED DETACHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY MADE ITS WAY TO THE GREEN RIVER COUNTRY
THE CHURCH IS A NEW ONE ONLY AS THE RIPENING FRUIT IS A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE COURSE OF THE TREE'S GROWTH
BUT TO RECALL THE TROOPS AT THAT JUNCTURE WOULD BE TO CONFESS HUMILIATING FAILURE
AFTER A FARCICAL SEMBLANCE OF A TRIAL THESE WERE ACQUITTED AND THUS WAS NOTICE SANCTIONED BY THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITY OF THE LAW SERVED UPON ALL ANTI-"MORMONS OF ILLINOIS THAT THEY WERE SAFE IN ANY ASSAULT THEY MIGHT CHOOSE TO MAKE ON THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR HATE
MORMONISM ACCEPTS THE DOCTRINE OF THE FALL AND THE ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSGRESSION IN EDEN AS SET FORTH IN GENESIS
BUT THE HARD-BAKED SOIL NEVER BEFORE DISTURBED BY THE EFFORTS OF MAN TO TILL REFUSED TO YIELD TO THE SHARE
HE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THE PEOPLE HIDDEN OR DEAD IN THEIR HOUSES
THROUGH THE TESTIMONY OF HIS LIFE'S WORK AND THE SANCTIFYING SEAL OF HIS MARTYRDOM THOUSANDS HAVE COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM ALL THAT HE PROFESSED TO BE--A MESSENGER FROM GOD TO THE PEOPLE
MR RICE MYSELF AND OTHERS COMPARED IT THE SPAULDING MANUSCRIPT WITH THE BOOK OF MORMON AND COULD DETECT NO RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE TWO IN GENERAL OR IN DETAIL
THEY SWARMED DOWN IN INNUMERABLE HORDES UPON THE FIELDS DESTROYING THE GROWING CROPS AS THEY ADVANCED DEVOURING ALL BEFORE THEM LEAVING THE LAND A DESERT IN THEIR TRACK
PROMPTLY HE PROCLAIMED THE TERRITORY UNDER MARTIAL LAW AND FORBADE ANY ARMED BODY TO CROSS ITS BOUNDARIES
5
HE IS BORN HEIR TO THE WEAKNESSES AS WELL AS TO THE EXCELLENCIES OF GENERATIONS OF ANCESTORS
MEANWHILE THE MARCH TO THE WEST WAS MAINTAINED
THEN THEY ABANDONED IT TO THE DESECRATION AND SELF-CONDEMNING OUTRAGES OF THEIR FOES
THE AWFUL WORK WAS CARRIED OUT WITH DREAD DISPATCH
IF HIS CLAIMS TO ORDINATION UNDER THE HANDS OF DIVINELY COMMISSIONED MESSENGERS BE FALLACIOUS FORMING AS THEY FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH ORGANIZATION THE SUPERSTRUCTURE CANNOT STAND
SOME OF THEM WERE BROKEN POLITICIANS PROFESSIONAL OFFICE-SEEKERS WITH NO DESIRE BUT TO SECURE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE GAIN OUT OF THEIR APPOINTMENT
A BRIEF PERIOD OF HESITATION IN WHICH HE SHRANK FROM THE THOUGHT THAT A MORTAL LIKE HIMSELF WEAK YOUTHFUL AND UNLEARNED SHOULD APPROACH THE CREATOR WITH A PERSONAL REQUEST WAS FOLLOWED BY A HUMBLE AND CONTRITE RESOLUTION TO ACT UPON THE COUNSEL OF THE ANCIENT APOSTLE
THERE HAD BEEN PEACE FOR A SEASON
BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE AND POWERS OF THE SUPREME TRINITY
I FOUND IT IN 1884 IN THE HANDS OF HON
BUT THAT PLURAL MARRIAGE IS A VITAL TENET OF THE CHURCH IS NOT TRUE
SIXTY NAMES WERE PRESENTED TO THE LOCAL GRAND JURY AND OF THE PERSONS SO DESIGNATED NINE WERE INDICTED
EACH OF THE THREE A SEPARATE AND INDIVIDUAL PERSONAGE
AND TO THE OPEN CHAGRIN OF THE COMMANDANT GOVERNOR CUMMING AND HIS FELLOW APPOINTEES MOVED TO SALT LAKE CITY UNDER MORMON ESCORT AFTER A FIVE MONTHS HALT IN THE WILDERNESS
YET WITH THEIR CHARACTERISTIC CHEERFULNESS THE PEOPLE MADE THE BEST AND THAT PROVED TO BE A GREAT DEAL OUT OF THEIR LOT
IN THE SETTLEMENTS COMBUSTIBLES WERE PLACED IN READINESS AND IF THE WORST CAME EVERY MORMON HOUSE WOULD BE REDUCED TO ASHES EVERY TREE WOULD BE HEWN DOWN
AS THE PEOPLE HAD ADOPTED THE PRACTISE UNDER WHAT WAS BELIEVED TO BE DIVINE APPROVAL THEY SUSPENDED IT WHEN THEY WERE JUSTIFIED IN SO DOING
A SPIRIT OF FIERCE PERSECUTION RAGED IN JACKSON AND SURROUNDING COUNTIES OF MISSOURI
ACCORDING TO THE TEACHINGS OF MORMONISM CHRIST'S INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PEOPLE TO PRAY THY KINGDOM COME THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN WAS NOT A PETITION FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE BUT A FORE-SHADOWING OF WHAT SHALL EVENTUALLY BE
WEAK WORN AND WEARY AS I AM SAID ONE OF THESE HEROINES I WOULD RATHER PUSH ON ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES THAN STAY HERE BUT THE VOICE OF THEIR LEADER WAS HEARD
DID THE STATE EVER MAKE ONE DECENT EFFORT TO DEFEND THEM AS FELLOW-CITIZENS IN THEIR RIGHTS OR TO REDRESS THEIR WRONGS
AT TIMES LIVING ON REDUCED RATIONS OF BUT A FEW OUNCES OF MEAL PER DAY
BUT THE GLORY OF THE CELESTIAL IS ONE AND THE GLORY OF THE TERRESTRIAL IS ANOTHER
IT WAS WINTER
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THESE VAST REGIONS WERE ALL POPULATED AT ANY ONE TIME BY THE NEPHITES
THE MORMON PEOPLE SAW IN THEIR TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES AND IN THE OUTRAGES TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SUBJECTED ONLY THE MAL-ADMINISTRATION OF LAWS AND THE SUBVERSION OF JUSTICE THROUGH HUMAN INCAPACITY AND HATRED
WHILE PUZZLING OVER THIS ANOMALY HE CHANCED UPON THIS VERSE IN THE EPISTLE OF ST JAMES
FOR A DETAILED TREATMENT OF TEMPLES AND TEMPLE LABOR AMONG THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS INCLUDING A STUDY OF THE DOCTRINE OF VICARIOUS LABOR FOR THE DEAD SEE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD A STUDY OF HOLY SANCTUARIES ANCIENT AND MODERN INCLUDING FORTY-SIX PLATES ILLUSTRATIVE OF MODERN TEMPLES
THE PROPER TITLE OF THE ORGANIZATION IS THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM IS DECLARED IN THE NAME
PAUL WARNED THE SAINTS OF THESSALONICA AGAINST THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST WAS THEN NEAR AT HAND
SAD AS HAVE BEEN THE EXPERIENCES OF THE PEOPLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PRACTISE DEEP AND ANGUISH-LADEN AS HAVE BEEN THE SIGHS AND GROANS HOT AND BITTER AS HAVE BEEN THE TEARS SO CAUSED THE HEAVIEST PERSECUTION THE CRUELEST TREATMENT OF THEIR HISTORY BEGAN BEFORE PLURAL MARRIAGE WAS KNOWN IN THE CHURCH
BON-FIRES WERE BLAZING DOWN IN THE GORGES AND THE IMPRESSION WAS MADE THAT THE MOUNTAINS WERE FULL OF ARMED MEN
THE STILLNESS THAT EVERYWHERE PREVAILED WAS PAINFUL BROKEN ONLY BY AN OCCASIONAL FAINT ECHO OF BOISTEROUS SHOUT OR RIBALD SONG FROM A DISTANCE
THAT HIS PERFECTION WHILE SO COMPLETE AS TO BE INCOMPREHENSIBLE BY MAN POSSESSES THIS ESSENTIAL QUALITY OF TRUE PERFECTION--THE CAPACITY OF ETERNAL INCREASE
IT REPUDIATES THE NAME OF MORTALS AS A PART OF ITS TITLE AND THUS DIFFERS FROM LUTHERANS AND WESLEYANS CALVINISTS MENNONITES AND MANY OTHERS ALL OF WHOM WORTHY THOUGH THEIR ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE ELEVATING AS MAY BE THEIR PRECEPTS GOOD AS MAY BE THEIR PRACTISES DECLARE THEMSELVES THE FOLLOWERS OF MEN
AS TO THE MODE OF BAPTISM THE CHURCH AFFIRMS THAT IMMERSION ALONE IS THE ONE METHOD SANCTIONED BY SCRIPTURE AND THAT THIS MODE HAS BEEN EXPRESSLY PRESCRIBED BY REVELATION IN THE PRESENT DISPENSATION
NOAH DID NOT DEPEND UPON THE RECORD OF GOD'S DEALINGS WITH ADAM OR ENOCH BUT WAS DIRECTED BY THE VERY WORD AND VOICE OF THE GOD WHOM HE REPRESENTED
I STATED THAT PROFESSIONAL MEN AND EVEN COLLEGE PROFESSORS RAISED THEIR VOICES IN COMMISERATION OF THE MORMON SITUATION AND IN DENOUNCING THE MORMON OPPRESSORS
NOT THE RELATIONSHIP OF A THING MECHANICALLY MADE TO THE MAKER THEREOF
THE PRESS OF THE STATE DENOUNCED THE TREATMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE MISSOURIANS AND VINDICATED THE CHARACTER OF THE MORMONS AS PEACEABLE AND LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS
SHE HAS WRITTEN HER OWN CHARACTER IN LETTERS OF BLOOD AND STAINED IT BY ACTS OF MERCILESS CRUELTY AND BRUTALITY THAT THE WATERS OF AGES CANNOT EFFACE
LET THE CLERGYMEN WHO ABETTED AND THE EDITORS WHO ENCOURAGED THE MOB ANSWER
WHO ARE THE DEAD BUT THOSE WHO AT SOME TIME HAVE LIVED IN MORTALITY
IT IS TO THEM AND EVER HAS BEEN THE WORD OF GOD A COMPILATION MADE BY HUMAN AGENCY OF WORKS BY VARIOUS INSPIRED WRITERS
BUT THE INCLEMENCY OF THE YEAR ONLY SUITED THE BETTER THE PURPOSE OF THE OPPRESSOR
12
RARELY INDEED DOES HISTORY PRESENT AN ORGANIZATION RELIGIOUS SOCIAL OR POLITICAL IN WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDS AS CONSPICUOUS AND IN ALL WAYS AS IMPORTANT A PLACE AS DOES THIS MAN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORMONISM THE EARNEST INVESTIGATOR THE SINCERE TRUTH-SEEKER CAN IGNORE NEITHER THE MAN NOR HIS WORK
STILL THE THEORY OF THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND AS SPAULDING'S STORY HAS COME TO BE KNOWN IS OCCASIONALLY PRESSED INTO SERVICE IN THE CAUSE OF ANTI-"MORMON ZEAL BY SOME WHOM WE WILL CHARITABLY BELIEVE TO BE IGNORANT OF THE FACTS SET FORTH BY PRESIDENT FAIRCHILD
AND FOR ALL THE DEAD WHO HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THE PRIVILEGES PERHAPS INDEED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF COMPLIANCE WITH CHRIST'S LAW THERE SHALL BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEREAFTER
WHEN HE SURRENDERED HIS PERSON TO GOVERNOR FORD IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD THE PROPHET HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF WHAT WAS BEFORE HIM
SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI--INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER
BUT THE INDIAN AGENT A CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN ORDERED THE MORMONS TO MOVE ON AND LEAVE THE RESERVATION WHICH A KIND GOVERNMENT HAD PROVIDED FOR ITS RED CHILDREN
IN FURTHER DEFENSE OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS AGAINST THE CHARGE OF INCONSISTENCY FOR THIS THEIR TOLERANCE TOWARD OTHERS WHOM THEY VERILY BELIEVE TO BE WRONG LET ME AGAIN URGE THE CARDINAL PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY MAN IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS ACTS AND SHALL BE JUDGED IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAW AS MADE KNOWN TO HIM
IT HAD LAIN AMONG HIS OLD PAPERS FORTY YEARS OR MORE AND WAS BROUGHT OUT BY MY ASKING HIM TO LOOK UP ANTI-SLAVERY DOCUMENTS AMONG HIS PAPERS
IN THOSE DEFILES AN ARMY MIGHT EASILY BE STOPPED BY A FEW
IN THE PERSONALITY OF THEIR LEADER IT WAS THOUGHT LAY THE SECRET OF THE PEOPLE'S STRENGTH
TALMAGE D
THE CENTRAL FEATURE OF THAT PLAN WAS THE EARTHLY MINISTRY AND REDEEMING SACRIFICE OF THE CHRIST IN THE MERIDIAN OF TIME
AND A CALL WAS MADE UPON THE MORMON REFUGEES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GENERAL FORCE BY FURNISHING A BATTALION OF FIVE HUNDRED MEN TO TAKE PART IN THE WAR WITH MEXICO
THE TALE OF THOSE DREARY MARCHES HAS NEVER YET BEEN TOLD
BY REVELATION PETER WAS DIRECTED TO CARRY THE GOSPEL TO THE GENTILES
THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM CHAPTER I IN THIS ATTEMPT TO TREAT THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM IT IS ASSUMED THAT NO DISCUSSION OF CHRISTIANITY IN GENERAL NOR OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF CHRISTIANITY IS REQUIRED
AND AFFIRMS THAT HUMAN DUTY IS NOT COMPRISED IN A MERE AVOIDANCE OF SIN
BRIGHAM YOUNG WHO FOR A DECADE HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE CAUSE WHO HAD RECEIVED HIS FULL SHARE OF PERSECUTION AT MOBOCRATIC HANDS NOW STOOD AT THE HEAD OF THE PRESIDING BODY IN THE PRIESTHOOD OF THE CHURCH
WAR HAD BROKEN OUT BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES
THE MORMON CREED SO FAR AS THERE IS A CREED PROFESSED BY THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS IS PRE-EMINENTLY CHRISTIAN IN THEORY PRECEPT AND PRACTISE
AFTER OUR LORD'S DEPARTURE WE READ OF THE APOSTLES CONTINUING THEIR LABORS IN THE LIGHT OF CONTINUED REVELATION
AND THAT THE CONCEPTION IS IN ACCORD WITH REASON
WHO ARE THE LIVING OF TODAY BUT THOSE WHO SHORTLY SHALL BE ADDED TO THE UNCOUNTED DEAD
WITH TENSE CALMNESS THE PLAN OF ACTION WAS DECIDED UPON
AND THEN WAS CAST INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD FOUND NOTHING BUT A BAG OF COSTLY PEARLS
HE HAD LED THE PEOPLE INTO THE LAND OF HOLY PROMISE AND HAD DIVIDED UNTO THEM THEIR INHERITANCES
AT THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTISE
THOSE WHO HAVE HAD TO SUFFER THE RESULTS OF THEIR SINS
THE WORK HAS BEEN DERISIVELY CALLED THE MORMON BIBLE A NAME THAT CARRIES WITH IT THE MISREPRESENTATION THAT IN THE FAITH OF THIS PEOPLE THE BOOK TAKES THE PLACE OF THE SCRIPTURAL VOLUME WHICH IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED BY CHRISTIAN SECTS
EVEN AS THE CRAWLING CATERPILLAR OR THE CORPSE-LIKE CHRYSALIS HOLDS THE LATENT POSSIBILITY NAY BARRING DESTRUCTION THE CERTAINTY INDEED OF THE WINGED IMAGO IN ALL THE GLORY OF MATURITY
THE APPARENT CREDIBILITY OF THE STATEMENT WAS INCREASED BY VARIOUS SIGNED DECLARATIONS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE TWO WERE ALIKE THOUGH NO EXTRACTS FOR COMPARISON WERE PRESENTED
THE WOLVES OF THE PLAINS HAD TOO OFTEN SUCCEEDED IN UNEARTHING AND RENDING THE BODIES
BUT THOUGH THE GROUND HAS BEEN DEDICATED WITH SOLEMN CEREMONY THE PEOPLE HAVE NOT AS YET BUILT THEREON
FOR A FULLER ACCOUNT OF THE BOOK OF MORMON SEE THE AUTHOR'S ARTICLES OF FAITH LECTURES 14 AND 15
AND IN THE LIGHT OF HIS DYING PROMISE TO THE PENITENT MALEFACTOR WHO SUFFERED ON A CROSS BY HIS SIDE WE LEARN THAT HE HAD BEEN IN PARADISE
EVERY ADDED PANG OF GRIEF SERVED BUT TO UNITE THE PEOPLE
WE CLAIM THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUAL AS TO EARTHLY RIGHTS AND HUMAN PRIVILEGES
EVEN THOSE WHO OPPOSED HIM IN POLITICS AND IN RELIGION RESPECTED HIM FOR HIS TALENTS HIS MAGNANIMITY HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MANLINESS
TO THEM MARRIAGE IS NOT CAN NEVER BE A CIVIL COMPACT ALONE
BUT THE LIVING SEED CONTAINS WITHIN ITS HUSK ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE MATURE PLANT
AND TODAY INSTEAD OF THE SINGLE PRIEST CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS OF JUDAEA THERE ARE THOUSANDS GOING FORTH AMONG THE NATIONS WITH A MESSAGE AS DEFINITE AND AS IMPORTANT AS THAT OF THE BAPTIST
WE HAVE SEEN OUR LEADERS SHOT DOWN BY THE DEMORALIZED SOLDIERY
YET AS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT IN THEIR PERSONALITY AS ARE ANY THREE INHABITANTS OF EARTH
THEY HAD NOT ROBBED THEY HAD NOT KILLED
JOSEPH SMITH HIMSELF THE HEAD OF THE DELEGATION HAD A PERSONAL INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT VAN BUREN IN WHICH THE GRIEVANCES OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS WERE PRESENTED
THE CLOUDS OF PERSECUTION THICKENED IN OHIO AS THE INTOLERANT ZEAL OF MOBS FOUND FREQUENT EXPRESSION
THE TIME-SPAN OF MORTAL LIFE IS BUT ONE STAGE IN THE SOUL'S CAREER SEPARATING THE ETERNITY THAT HAS PRECEDED FROM THE ETERNITY THAT IS TO FOLLOW
A MORMON REBELLION WAS NOW PROCLAIMED
THEY PLACE IT FOREMOST AMONGST THE STANDARD WORKS OF THE CHURCH
BUT ON THEY WENT NEVER SWERVING FROM THE COURSE
WERE THEY NOT SAFE FROM SAVAGE FOES BOTH RED AND WHITE
THERE IS ONE GLORY OF THE SUN AND ANOTHER GLORY OF THE MOON AND ANOTHER GLORY OF THE STARS
AND A GREAT PART OF THE COMPANY WALKED THE FULL THOUSAND MILES ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS AND THE FORBIDDING DESERTS OF THE WEST
THERE IS THE CELESTIAL STATE PROVIDED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED THE WHOLE LAW WHO HAVE ACCEPTED THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHRIST WHO HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIRED ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL WHO HAVE BEEN VALIANT IN THE CAUSE OF VIRTUE AND TRUTH
BUT THIS WONDERFUL VISION WAS NOT THE ONLY MANIFESTATION OF HEAVENLY POWER AND PERSONALITY MADE TO THE YOUNG MAN NOR THE ONLY INCIDENT OF THE KIND DESTINED TO BRING UPON HIM THE FURY OF PERSECUTION
AND YET IT LOOKS UPON MORALITY AS BUT THE ALPHABET FROM WHICH THE WORDS AND SENTENCES OF A TRULY RELIGIOUS LIFE MAY BE FRAMED
AND PENDING ACTION A TEMPORARY REGIME WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE NAME OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF DESERET
YET THE CHURCH IS NONE THE LESS THE BEGINNING OF THE KINGDOM THE GERM FROM WHICH THE KINGDOM SHALL DEVELOP
THEY SOUGHT AND BELIEVED THEY HAD FOUND A FAITH'S PURE SHRINE


THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN IS TO LIVE AND WORK ACCORDING TO THE HIGHEST LAWS OF RIGHT MADE KNOWN TO HIM TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE BEST LIGHT THAT HAS BEEN SHED ABOUT HIS PATH
IN THEM THE ORDINANCES OF BAPTISM AND THE LAYING ON OF HANDS FOR THE BESTOWAL OF THE HOLY GHOST ARE PERFORMED UPON THE LIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEAD.[6 FOOTNOTE 6
IN ALL THE MORAL VIRTUES;--THESE PROFESSIONS AND BELIEFS ARE AS A COMMON CREED IN THE REALM OF CHRISTENDOM
HE INHERITS POTENT TENDENCIES FOR BOTH GOOD AND EVIL
SICKENED WITH THE SIGHT DISGUSTED WITH THIS SPECTACLE OF OUTRAGE THE COLONEL RECROSSED THE RIVER AT NIGHTFALL BEATING UPWARD FOR THE WIND HAD FRESHENED
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH IN THE PRESENT AGE WAS BUT A RESTORATION
THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS HAVE BUT ONE BIBLE AND THAT THE HOLY BIBLE OF CHRISTENDOM
NEVERTHELESS THIS LIFE OF OURS IS NO TRIFLE NO INSIGNIFICANT INCIDENT IN THE SOUL'S ETERNAL COURSE HAVING BUT SMALL AND TEMPORAL IMPORTANCE THE OMISSIONS OF WHICH CAN BE RECTIFIED WITH EASE BY THE INDIVIDUAL BEYOND THE VEIL
THE PETITION OF THE PEOPLE WAS DENIED IN PART AND IN 1850 WAS ESTABLISHED THE TERRITORIAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN UTAH
THE CITY OF NAUVOO WAS CHARTERED BY THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT WERE ASSURED TO ITS CITIZENS
THAT THROUGH THE AGES ONE INCREASING PURPOSE RUNS
WHO BECAUSE OF HIS VINDICTIVENESS INCURRED THE ILL-FAVOR OF THE GOVERNOR WHOSE POSSE COMITATUS THE ARMY WAS
ITS CREED PROVIDES FOR THE PROTECTION OF ALL MEN IN THEIR RIGHTS OF WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE
THE TROOPS WERE PUT INTO CAMP FORTY MILES FROM THE SETTLEMENTS AND THE SETTLERS RETURNED
WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST ALL MANKIND MAY BE SAVED BY OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS AND ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL
IT LIVES AND THRIVES BECAUSE WITHIN IT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF THRIFT AND THE FORCES OF LIFE
BUT THAT OPPORTUNITY SHALL BE GIVEN TO EVERY ONE IN THE SEASON OF HIS FITNESS TO RECEIVE IT BE HE HEATHEN OR CIVILIZED LIVING OR DEAD
WE BELIEVE IN THE GIFT OF TONGUES PROPHECY REVELATION VISIONS HEALING INTERPRETATION OF TONGUES ETC
COLLEGE PROFESSORS PUBLISHED EXPRESSIONS OF THEIR HORROR OVER THE CRUEL CRUSADE
THE EVIDENCE WARRANTED THEIR CONCLUSION THAT INVASION MEANT MASSACRE
IT IS TRUE GOD LIVES BUT HE CARES NOT FOR HIS CHILDREN OF MODERN TIMES AS HE DID FOR THOSE OF ANCIENT DAYS
HINDLEY ESQ DEAR SIR
PREFACE THE STORY OF MORMONISM AS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES IS A REVISED AND RECONSTRUCTED VERSION OF LECTURES DELIVERED BY DR JAMES E
CHAPTER V AFTER ALL THE MORMON PEOPLE REGARD THE ADVENT OF THE BUCHANAN ARMY AS ONE OF THE GREATEST MATERIAL BLESSINGS EVER BROUGHT TO THEM
TALMAGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CORNELL UNIVERSITY AND ELSEWHERE
AND WHEN THAT POWERFUL WAVE OF RELIGIOUS AGITATION AND SECTARIAN REVIVAL WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE LAST CENTURY REACHED THE HOME OF THE SMITHS JOSEPH WITH OTHERS OF THE FAMILY WAS PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED
CONCERTS AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS WERE USUAL FEATURES OF THE EVENING RESTS
THE REGION TO WHICH THE EARLY SETTLERS CAME WAS IN NO WISE A TYPICAL LAND OF PROMISE
THAT ALTHOUGH THE LAW OF CONGRESS DESIGNATED AS AN OFFENSE THE ACKNOWLEDGING OF MORE LIVING WIVES THAN ONE BY ANY MAN AND PRESCRIBED A PENALTY THEREFOR AS CONGRESS HAD NOT SPECIFIED THE LENGTH OF TIME DURING WHICH THIS UNLAWFUL ACKNOWLEDGING MUST CONTINUE TO CONSTITUTE THE OFFENSE GRAND JURIES MIGHT INDICT SEPARATELY FOR EVERY DAY OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE FORBIDDEN RELATIONSHIP EXISTED
WITH THE SEAL OF THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD UPON THEIR WEDDED STATE THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE IMPLICITLY IN THE PERPETUITY OF THAT RELATIONSHIP ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE GRAVE
COLONEL THOMAS L
THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS POINT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE TO WHAT THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED AND BEGUN AND TO THE LITTLE THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE IN THE LINE OF THEIR CONVICTIONS AS PROOF OF THEIR SINCERITY
NOT SO SAID BRIGHAM YOUNG WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH TROOPS IN THE PAST GOVERNOR CUMMING
IN SHORT IT IS BOLD ENOUGH TO DECLARE THAT MAN'S SPIRIT BEING THE OFFSPRING OF DEITY AND MAN'S BODY THOUGH OF EARTHY COMPONENTS YET BEING IN THE VERY IMAGE AND LIKENESS OF GOD MAN EVEN IN HIS PRESENT DEGRADED--AYE FALLEN CONDITION--STILL POSSESSES IF ONLY IN A LATENT STATE INHERITED TRAITS TENDENCIES AND POWERS THAT TELL OF HIS MORE THAN ROYAL DESCENT
AND SO ON THROUGH ALL THE LINE OF PROPHETS MAJOR AND MINOR DOWN TO THE PRIEST OF THE COURSE OF ABIA UNTO WHOM THE ANGEL ANNOUNCED THE BIRTH OF JOHN WHO WAS TO BE THE DIRECT FORE-RUNNER OF THE MESSIAH
THUS WAS THE UNHOLY VOW OF THE MOB FULFILLED THAT AS LAW COULD NOT TOUCH THE MORMON LEADERS POWDER AND BALL SHOULD
THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS OF THIS OFFICER TO DISARM THE NORTH WHILE ACCUMULATING THE MUNITIONS OF WAR IN THE SOUTH
NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED THE NAME THUS THRUST UPON THEM AND ANSWER READILY TO ITS CALL
PETER ALSO TELLS US OF HIS LABORS--THAT HE WAS PREACHING TO THE SPIRITS IN PRISON TO THOSE WHO HAD BEEN DISOBEDIENT IN THE DAYS OF NOAH WHEN THE LONG-SUFFERING OF GOD WAITED WHILE THE ARK WAS PREPARING
ELIJAH'S VISITATION TO EARTH HAS BEEN REALIZED
BUT NOT ALL THE OFFICIALS SENT TO UTAH FROM AFAR WERE OF THIS TYPE
CHAPTER IV THE DANGERS OF THE FIRST COMPANY'S MIGRATION WERE SURPASSED BY THOSE OF PARTIES WHO SUBSEQUENTLY BRAVED THE TERRORS OF THE PLAINS
BY A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN 1884 PRESIDENT JAMES H
ISRAEL OF OLD WERE LED AND GOVERNED IN ALL MATTERS SPIRITUAL AND TO A GREAT EXTENT IN THEIR TEMPORAL AFFAIRS BY THE DIRECT WORD OF REVELATION
IF THERE IS ANYTHING VIRTUOUS LOVELY OR OF GOOD REPORT OR PRAISEWORTHY WE SEEK AFTER THESE THINGS.--JOSEPH SMITH
OF SUCH A NATURE WAS THE CHURCH IN SO FAR AS IT EXISTED BEFORE THE TIME OF CHRIST'S EARTHLY MINISTRY
THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS BELIEVE THE COMING FORTH OF THE BOOK OF MORMON TO HAVE BEEN FORETOLD IN THE BIBLE AS ITS DESTINY IS PROPHESIED OF WITHIN ITS OWN LIDS
THUS FAR EVERY MOVE HAD CARRIED THEM WESTWARD BUT FARTHER WEST THEY COULD NOT GO UNLESS THEY WENT ENTIRELY BEYOND THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH AND GAVE UP THEIR HOPE OF PROTECTION UNDER THE CONSTITUTION WHICH TO THEM HAD EVER BEEN AN INSPIRED INSTRUMENT THE MAJESTY OF WHICH AS THEY HAD NEVER DOUBTED WOULD BE SOME DAY VINDICATED EVEN TO SECURING FOR THEM THE RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
BUT OF WHAT USE IS GOLD IN THE WILDERNESS
BUT JOSEPH WHILE FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY THE METHODISTS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHERS CONFESSES THAT HIS MIND WAS SORELY TROUBLED OVER THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE STRIFE AND TUMULT EXISTING AMONG THE RELIGIOUS BODIES
THIS TOGETHER WITH RAFTS SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED WAS NOW PUT TO GOOD USE IN FERRYING ACROSS THE RIVER NOT ALONE THEMSELVES AND THEIR LITTLE PROPERTY BUT THE OTHER COMPANIES AND THEIR LOADS
TODAY THERE ARE LIVING IN THE SMILING VALES OF UTAH MEN AND WOMEN WHO THEN AS BOYS AND GIRLS TRUDGED WEARILY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES DRAGGING THE LUMBERING CARTS THAT CONTAINED THEIR ENTIRE PROVISION AGAINST STARVATION AND FREEZING
ECHO CANYON THE ONE PROMISING ROUTE OF INGRESS WAS FORTIFIED
AT FIRST MANY OF THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS WERE APPOINTED FROM AMONG THE SETTLERS THEMSELVES
THE WILDERNESS WAS BLOSSOMING UNDER THEIR FEET
WE BELIEVE FURTHER THAT CONTRACTS AS OF MARRIAGE TO BE VALID BEYOND THE VEIL OF MORTALITY MUST BE SANCTIONED BY A POWER GREATER THAN THAT OF EARTH
THE PEOPLE CHALLENGE THE MOST CRITICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN THIS RECORD OF THE WEST AND THE HOLY SCRIPTURES OF THE EAST FEELING CONFIDENT THAT NO DISCREPANCY EXISTS IN LETTER OR SPIRIT
AMMUNITION STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED
BY THIS SURE GUIDE THEY SELECTED AND SET APART THOSE WHO WERE TO OFFICIATE IN THE CHURCH
SHALL WE SUPPOSE THAT ALL OF GOD'S GOOD GIFTS TO HIS CHILDREN ARE RESTRICTED TO THE NARROW LIMITS OF MORTAL EXISTENCE
BUT ANOTHER GREAT EVENT DISTURBED THE EQUANIMITY OF THE CAMP
LET US REVERT HOWEVER TO THE FACTS OF HISTORY CONCERNING THIS NEW SCRIPTURE AND THE RECEPTION ACCORDED THE PRINTED VOLUME
THEY LIVED ON THE RESULTS OF THE CHASE AND BY PLUNDER DEGENERATING IN HABIT UNTIL THEY BECAME TYPICAL PROGENITORS OF THE DARK-SKINNED RACE AFTERWARD DISCOVERED BY COLUMBUS AND NAMED AMERICAN INDIANS
ALREADY THE SICK AND THE HALT HAD BEEN NEGLECTED
MORMONISM IS FOR THE WAYFARING MAN NOT LESS THAN FOR THE SCHOLAR AND IT POSSESSES A SIMPLICITY ADAPTING IT TO THE ONE AS TO THE OTHER
AND HE HESITATED
GENERAL KEARNEY AND HIS SUCCESSOR GOVERNOR R
THE HOLY GHOST A PERSONAGE OF SPIRIT
WELCOME BROTHERS IN RETURN MUCH ASSISTANCE WAS RENDERED BY THE WHITE REFUGEES TO THEIR SHALL I SAY SAVAGE FRIENDS
NOR HAS ANY REVELATION TO THE CHURCH YET APPEARED IN OPPOSITION TO EARLIER REVELATION OF THIS OR OF BY-GONE DISPENSATIONS
IN WHATEVER LIGHT THIS PRACTISE HAS BEEN REGARDED IN THE PAST IT IS TODAY A DEAD ISSUE FORBIDDEN BY ECCLESIASTICAL RULE AS IT IS PROHIBITED BY LEGAL STATUTE
IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE ARE MANY MANSIONS JOHN 14:2 DECLARED THE SAVIOR TO HIS APOSTLES
DURING HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY CHRIST CALLED AND ORDAINED MEN TO OFFICES IN THE CHURCH
FINDING THAT HE WAS A STRANGER THEY RELATED TO HIM IN FIENDISH GLEE THEIR RECENT EXPLOITS OF PILLAGE RAPINE AND MURDER
76 WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE THREE WELL-DEFINED DEGREES IN THE FUTURE STATE WITH NUMEROUS PERHAPS NUMBERLESS GRADATIONS
SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
UTAH HAS NOT SECEDED BUT IS FIRM FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF OUR COUNTRY
THE CHILD BORN UNDER CONDITIONS OF ADVERSITY MAY AFTER ALL BE RICHLY ENDOWED WITH OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY WHICH PERHAPS HAD BEEN LESS OF SERVICE AMID THE SURROUNDINGS OF LUXURY
AND THIS MEANS IS FOUND IN THE REQUIREMENT CONCERNING BAPTISM AS ESSENTIAL TO ENTRANCE INTO THE CHURCH AND AS A MEANS WHEREBY REMISSION OF SINS MAY BE OBTAINED
THE TROOPS ONCE IN UTAH HAD TO BE PROVISIONED
WE HAVE SEEN MOTHERS WITH BABES AT THEIR BREASTS SENT TO THEIR LAST HOME BY THE SAME BULLET
IT WAS AT THIS VERY TIME THAT THE OVERLAND TELEGRAPH LINE WHICH HAD BEEN APPROACHING FROM THE ATLANTIC AND THE PACIFIC WAS COMPLETED AND THE FIRST TREMOR FELT IN THAT NERVE OF STEEL CARRIED THESE WORDS FROM BRIGHAM YOUNG
MIGRATION FROM OTHER STATES AND FROM FOREIGN SHORES CONTINUED TO SWELL THE MORMON BAND AND THIS BUT ANGERED THE OPPRESSORS THE MORE
BUT WHY DID HE SWEAR SO RECKLESSLY WHEN THE ONE BEFORE WHOM HE SWORE WAS NO MORE AN OFFICIAL THAN HIMSELF
UNTIL ABOUT THE YEAR 400 A.D
THE PEOPLE PAUSED BUT LONG ENOUGH TO BURY THEIR DEAD AND CLEAR THEIR EYES FROM THE BLINDING TEARS THAT FELL
AN APPEAL WAS MADE TO THE EXECUTIVE OF THE STATE BUT LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT WAS RETURNED
SIGHTING THE CITY FROM THE WESTERN SHORE OF THE MIGHTY MISSISSIPPI AS IT NESTLED IN THE RIVER'S ENCIRCLING EMBRACE HE CROSSED TO ITS PRINCIPAL WHARF AND THERE TO HIS SURPRISE FOUND NO SOUL TO MEET HIM
BUT BEFORE THE CLERK'S COMMUNICATION HAD REACHED ITS DESTINATION SO DIFFICULT IS IT FOR STATELY TRUTH TO OVERTAKE FLITTING FALSEHOOD THE MISCHIEF HAD BEEN DONE
SUCH WAS THE SCENE OF DESOLATION THAT GREETED THE PIONEER BAND
BUT INSINCERE THEY CANNOT BE EVEN IN THE JUDGMENT OF THEIR BITTEREST OPPONENT IF HE BE A CREATURE OF REASON
THE DYING HEAVING THEIR PARTING SIGHS IN THE ARMS OF LOVED ONES WHO WERE SOON TO FOLLOW THEY JOURNEYED ON
THE UNITY OF THE GODHEAD IS ACCEPTED IN THE LITERAL FULNESS OF SCRIPTURAL DECLARATION--THAT THE THREE ARE ONE IN PURPOSE PLAN AND METHOD ALIKE IN ALL THEIR GODLY ATTRIBUTES
BUT THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT SPEEDY ENOUGH TO SUIT AND THE LAWLESS PERSECUTION WAS WAGED THE MORE RUTHLESSLY
THEIR PATH FROM THE MISSOURI TO THE PACIFIC LED THEM OVER TWO THOUSAND MILES MUCH OF THIS DISTANCE BEING MEASURED THROUGH DESERTS WHICH PRIOR TO THAT TIME HAD NOT BEEN TRODDEN BY CIVILIZED FOOT
IT WAS MIDDAY AND THE FESTIVITIES WERE AT THEIR HEIGHT WHEN A PARTY OF MEN RODE INTO CAMP AND SOUGHT AN INTERVIEW WITH GOVERNOR YOUNG
I AM GOING LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID BUT I AM AS CALM AS A SUMMER'S MORNING
THE UTAH MORMONS OBTAINED THE COPY OF MR RICE AT HONOLULU AND THE JOSEPHITES GOT IT OF ME AFTER IT CAME INTO MY POSSESSION
THREE OF THEM HAD PLAINLY RIDDEN HARD AND FAR
MORMONISM ANSWERS
BUT IN FEBRUARY 1848 THE TREATY OF GUADELOUPE HIDALGO GAVE CALIFORNIA TO THE UNITED STATES
R
R
IN THEIR ENTHUSIASM TO REACH THE GATHERING PLACE OF THEIR PEOPLE MANY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS SET OUT FROM IOWA WHERE RAILWAY FACILITIES HAD THEIR TERMINATION WITH HAND-CARTS ONLY AS A MEANS OF CONVEYANCE
15:40-42 THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS CLAIM A REVELATION OF THE PRESENT DISPENSATION AS SUPPLEMENTING THE SCRIPTURE JUST QUOTED
SETTLING IN A MEXICAN PROVINCE THE CONTEST TO DETERMINE ITS FUTURE OWNERSHIP BY THE UNITED STATES THEN IN PROGRESS THE PEOPLE IN COMMON WITH MOST PIONEER COMMUNITIES ESTABLISHED THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT
THE RECORDS HE DECLARED HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED EXCEPT BY OFFICIAL HANDS AND FROM THE TIME OF THE COURT'S ESTABLISHMENT THE FILES HAD BEEN SAFE AND WERE THEN IN HIS PERSONAL KEEPING
WHEN THE CAMP HALTED A CITY SEEMED TO SPRING AS IF BY MAGIC FROM THE PRAIRIE SOIL
BUT TO RETRACT WOULD BE A PLAIN CONFESSION OF ERROR
THE STORY FIRST APPEARED IN PRINT AS A LECTURE REPORT IN THE IMPROVEMENT ERA AND WAS AFTERWARD ISSUED AS A BOOKLET FROM THE OFFICE OF THE MILLENNIAL STAR LIVERPOOL
THE CHURCH CLAIMS THAT IN THE PRESENT AGE THIS RESTORATION HAS BEEN EFFECTED BY THE PERSONAL MINISTRATIONS OF THOSE WHO EXERCISED THE AUTHORITY IN EARLIER DISPENSATIONS
NONE KNEW HIS PERSONAL POWER BETTER THAN THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FLOCK UNLESS INDEED IT WERE THE WOLVES WHO WERE EVER SEEKING TO HARRY THE FOLD
IN THE DREAD ALTERNATIVE OFFERED THEM THE PEOPLE DETERMINED AGAIN TO ABANDON THEIR HOMES
FOR EXTENDED TREATMENT OF MORMON DOCTRINE SEE THE ARTICLES OF FAITH
AND THERE BEYOND AROUND THE GREAT TEMPLE THAT HAD FIRST ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION FROM THE IOWA SHORE ARMED MEN WERE BIVOUACKED
THE PEOPLE WERE CONTINUALLY MOVING TO ESCAPE THE DEPREDATIONS OF THEIR HEREDITARY FOES THE LAMANITES
YET THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE SHALL BE THEN THE EQUAL OF THE DEITY HE NOW WORSHIPS NOR THAT HE SHALL EVER OVERTAKE THOSE INTELLIGENCES THAT ARE ALREADY BEYOND HIM IN ADVANCEMENT
THE WILD SUNFLOWER LENT ITS GOLDEN HUE TO INTENSIFY THE SHARP CONTRASTS
PRESIDENT BUCHANAN TACITLY ADMITTED HIS MISTAKE
HE WHO WAS SO VEHEMENT IN HIS DENUNCIATION OF THE REBEL MORMONS AND WHO REJOICED IN BEING SELECTED TO CHASTISE THEM INTO SUBMISSION
THE YELLOW METAL WAS COLLECTED IN BUCKETS AND EXPORTED TO THE STATES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GOODS SO MUCH DESIRED
FOR TREATMENT OF CELESTIAL MARRAIGE AND OTHER TEMPLE ORDINANCES SEE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BY THE PRESENT AUTHOR SALT LAKE CITY UTAH 1912 THERE IS NO SECT NOR PEOPLE THAT SETS A HIGHER VALUE ON VIRTUE AND CHASTITY THAN DO THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS NOR A PEOPLE THAT VISITS SURER RETRIBUTION UPON THE HEADS OF OFFENDERS AGAINST THE LAWS OF SEXUAL PURITY
THAT MANKIND IN GENERAL ARE ABSOLUTELY ABSOLVED FROM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT ORIGINAL SIN AND THAT EACH SHALL ACCOUNT FOR HIS OWN TRANSGRESSIONS ALONE
HER RESOURCES WERE DEVELOPED HER WEALTH BECAME A TOPIC OF THE WORLD'S WONDER
THEY CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI AND SOUGHT PROTECTION ON THE SOIL OF ILLINOIS
AND THE WORLD IS LEARNING TO ITS MANIFEST SURPRISE THAT PLURAL MARRIAGE AND MORMONISM ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS TERMS
BRIGHAM YOUNG WITH A FEW OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE CHURCH AND AIDS RETURNED EASTWARD ON SUCH AN ERRAND OF RESCUE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS AFTER FIRST REACHING THE VALLEY
10
AND NO LONGER EMPLOYED FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE PURPOSES OF ITS ERECTION
MORMONISM IS FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS A NEW RELIGION AND THE CHURCH AS A NEW CHURCH A MERE ADDITION OF ONE TO THE MANY SECTS THAT HAVE SO LONG STRIVEN FOR RECOGNITION AND ASCENDENCY AMONG MEN
AND THEIR DESERT HOMES WERE ALREADY SMILING IN WEALTH OF FLOWER AND TREE
THE CONSUMMATION SHALL BE USHERED IN BY THE RETURN OF THAT SAME CHRIST TO EARTH AS THE REWARDER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THE AVENGER OF INIQUITY AND AS THE WORLD'S JUDGE
THAT THEREFORE IN THE FAR FUTURE BEYOND THE HORIZON OF ETERNITIES PERCHANCE MAN MAY ATTAIN THE STATUS OF A GOD
TERRIBLE AS WAS THE BLOW OF THE FEARFUL FATALITY THE CHURCH SOON EMERGED FROM ITS DESPAIRING STATE OF POIGNANT GRIEF AND ROSE MIGHTIER THAN BEFORE
THE ELEMENT OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE ASSERTED ITSELF AND THE MORMONS BADE FAIR TO SOON HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER IN LOCAL AFFAIRS
THE CHURCH DECLINES TO SAIL UNDER ANY FLAG OF MAN-MADE DESIGN
WE BELIEVE IN THE LITERAL GATHERING OF ISRAEL AND IN THE RESTORATION OF THE TEN TRIBES
OF THE FEDERAL APPOINTEES THUS FORCED UPON THE PEOPLE OF UTAH MANY MADE FOR THEMSELVES MOST UNENVIABLE RECORDS
DROUGHT AND UNSEASONABLE FROSTS MADE THE FIRST YEAR'S FARMING EXPERIMENTS BUT DOUBTFUL SUCCESSES AND IN THE SUCCEEDING SPRING THE LAND WAS VISITED BY THE DEVASTATING PLAGUE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN CRICKETS
AND THEIR PROCLAMATION IS A REITERATION OF THE VOICE IN THE DESERT--"REPENT REPENT
AS THE WINDS OF WINTER THE STORMS OF THE YEAR'S DEEPEST NIGHT DO BUT HARDEN AND STRENGTHEN THE MOUNTAIN PINE WHOSE ROOTS STRIKE THE DEEPER WHOSE BRANCHES THICKEN WHOSE TWIGS MULTIPLY BY THE INCLEMENCY THAT WOULD BE FATAL TO THE EXOTIC PALM RAISED BY MAN WITH HOT-HOUSE NURSING SO THE NEW SECT CONTINUED ITS GROWTH PARTLY IN SPITE OF PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE STORMS TO WHICH IT WAS SUBJECTED
WELCOME SAID THESE CHILDREN OF THE FOREST WE TOO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FROM OUR PLEASANT HOMES EAST OF THE GREAT RIVER TO THESE DAMP AND UNHEALTHFUL BOTTOMS
AND THE SECTS THAT BEFORE COULD NOT AGREE TOGETHER NOR ABIDE IN PEACE BECAME AS ONE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO OPPOSE THE YOUTH WHO THUS TESTIFIED OF FACTS WHICH THOUGH VEHEMENTLY DENOUNCED PRODUCED AN EFFECT THAT ALARMED THEM THE MORE
THE TERM ORIGIN IS HERE USED IN ITS COMMONEST APPLICATION--THAT OF THE FIRST STAGES APPARENT TO ORDINARY OBSERVATION--THE VISIBLE BIRTH OF THE SYSTEM
THAT SUCH INDEED IS THE NATURAL INTERPRETATION
THE GOLD CHANGED HANDS
NO DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD IN THE SOLEMN DECLARATION OF THE SAVIOR TO NICODEMUS WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE WIDEST POSSIBLE APPLICATION,--THAT EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN OF WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT HE CANNOT ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD
NOR THE WEALTH OF SEAS
THIS STATEMENT ASSUMES AS GRANTED A DISTINCTION BETWEEN BIGAMY AND THE MORMON INSTITUTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE
THUS THE EXPATRIATED PIONEERS FOUND THEMSELVES RELIEVED FROM WANT WITH THEIR MEAL SACKS REPLENISHED IN THE HEART OF THE WILDERNESS
BOULDERS WERE COLLECTED UPON THE CLIFFS BENEATH WHICH THE INVADERS MUST PASS IF THEY HELD TO THEIR PURPOSE OF FORCING AN ENTRANCE
THE ONLY BOUNDS TO THE LIBERTY OF AN INDIVIDUAL ARE SUCH AS MARK THE LIBERTY OF ANOTHER OR THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMUNITY
AND BY OTHERS THAT THE DESIGN WAS TO MAKE SALT LAKE CITY THE CAPITAL OF AN INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT
THAT SHOULD THEY DIE BEFORE REACHING YEARS OF ACCOUNTABILITY THEY RETURN WITHOUT TAINT OF EARTHLY SIN
MORMONISM CLAIMS THAT NOT ONLY SHALL THE GOSPEL BE CARRIED TO THE LIVING AND BE PREACHED TO EVERY CREATURE BUT THAT THE GREAT MISSIONARY LABOR THE BURDEN OF WHICH HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE CHURCH MUST OF NECESSITY BE EXTENDED TO THE REALM OF THE DEAD
BUT MOB VIOLENCE WAS SUPREME MORE MIGHTY THAN THE POWER OF THE STATE MILITIA PLACED THERE TO GUARD THE PRISON
THEY ACCEPT ITS TEACHINGS IN FULNESS MODIFYING THE MEANING IN NO WISE EXCEPT IN THE RARE CASES OF UNDOUBTED MISTRANSLATION CONCERNING WHICH BIBLICAL SCHOLARS OF ALL FAITHS DIFFER AND CRITICIZE
THESE TWO PROVINCES COMPRISED IN ADDITION TO THE TERRITORY NOW DESIGNATED BY THOSE NAMES UTAH NEVADA PORTIONS OF WYOMING AND COLORADO AS ALSO ARIZONA
THIS TIME THEIR FACES WERE TURNED TOWARD THE EAST
IN THE MEANTIME A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE SITUATION WAS REPORTED BY GOVERNOR YOUNG TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE TRUTH SLOWLY MADE ITS WAY INTO THE EASTERN PRESS
JOHN TAYLOR WHO BECAME YEARS AFTERWARD PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE JAIL AT THE SAME TIME
AND AS THEY WATCHED AND PRAYED AND WORKED THEY SAW APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH AND WEST A VERITABLE HOST OF WINGED CREATURES OF MORE FORMIDABLE PROPORTIONS STILL
LET US OBSERVE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE PRESENT PROPORTIONS OF THE CHURCH
AND IN THE TOWN OF INDEPENDENCE A SITE FOR A GREAT TEMPLE HAD BEEN SELECTED AND PURCHASED
WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AS FAR AS IT IS TRANSLATED CORRECTLY
DESERET A BOOK OF MORMON NAME FOR THE HONEY BEE WAS MORE APPROPRIATE
MORMONISM REJECTS WHAT IT REGARDS AS A HERESY THE FALSE DOCTRINE OF PRE-DESTINATION AS AN ABSOLUTE COMPULSION OR EVEN AS AN IRRESISTIBLE TENDENCY FORCED UPON THE INDIVIDUAL TOWARD RIGHT OR WRONG--AS A PRE-APPOINTMENT TO EVENTUAL EXALTATION OR CONDEMNATION
LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT THESE ARTICLES OF FAITH ARE OR PROFESS TO BE A COMPLETE CODE OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH FOR AS DECLARED IN ONE OF THE ARTICLES BELIEF IN CONTINUOUS REVELATION FROM HEAVEN IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF MORMONISM YET IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT NO DOCTRINE HAS BEEN PROMULGATED WHICH BY EVEN STRAINED INTERPRETATION COULD BE CONSTRUED AS ANTAGONISTIC TO THIS EARLY DECLARATION OF FAITH
THIS IS NOT THE CHURCH OF MOSES NOR THE PROPHETS OF PAUL NOR OF CEPHAS OF APOLLOS NOR OF JOHN
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE AUTHOR'S DEATH ONE HURLBURT AN APOSTATE MORMON ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD RECOGNIZED A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE MANUSCRIPT STORY AND THE BOOK OF MORMON AND EXPRESSED A BELIEF THAT THE WORK BROUGHT FORWARD BY JOSEPH SMITH WAS NOTHING BUT THE SPAULDING ROMANCE REVISED AND AMPLIFIED
THEY WERE ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED AFTER A SERIES OF DECISIVE BATTLES THE LAST OF WHICH WAS FOUGHT NEAR THE VERY HILL CALLED CUMORAH IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK WHERE THE HIDDEN RECORD WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REVEALED TO JOSEPH SMITH
THE MOST VITAL QUESTIONS AMERICANS ARE ASKING EACH OTHER TODAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS MAN AND WHAT HE HAS LEFT US
TODAY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE
IF IT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY OR JUST THAT THE GOSPEL BE CARRIED TO SPIRITS THAT WERE DISOBEDIENT OR NEGLECTFUL IN THE DAYS OF NOAH ARE WE JUSTIFIED IN CONCLUDING THAT OTHERS WHO HAVE REJECTED OR NEGLECTED THE WORD OF GOD SHALL BE LEFT IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL CONDEMNATION
AND THAT PURPOSE,--THE WORKING OUT OF A DIVINE PLAN THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF WHICH IS THE SALVATION AND EXALTATION OF THE HUMAN FAMILY
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE GOLD FEVER WAS AT ITS HEIGHT A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE PRECIOUS METAL IN CALIFORNIA IN WHICH DISCOVERY INDEED CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE DISBANDED MORMON BATTALION WORKING THEIR WAY EASTWARD WERE MOST PROMINENT
FOR THE MOB'S DECREE HAD GONE FORTH THAT THE MORMONS MUST LEAVE ILLINOIS
S
AND THIS MORTAL EXISTENCE IS ONE OF THE FATHER'S GREAT GIFTS TO HIS SPIRITUAL CHILDREN AFFORDING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF AN UNTRAMMELED EXERCISE OF THEIR FREE AGENCY THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING TEMPTATION AND OF RESISTING IT IF THEY WILL THE CHANCE TO WIN EXALTATION AND ETERNAL LIFE
THUS THE MESSIAH WAS A REVELATOR RECEIVING WHILE IN THE FLESH COMMUNICATION DIRECT AND FREQUENT FROM THE HEAVENS
AND IS THIS THE PROMISED LAND
AND THAT THEREFORE IT IS THE CHURCH AND THE ONLY CHURCH OF CHRIST UPON THE EARTH TODAY
SOMETIME AFTER THIS VISITATION WHICH CONSTITUTED HIM A LIVING WITNESS OF GOD UNTO MEN AND WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE GREAT FACT THAT HUMANITY IS THE CHILD OF DEITY HE WAS VISITED BY AN IMMORTAL PERSONAGE WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS MORONI A MESSENGER SENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD
OVERJOYED AT THE GLORIOUS MANIFESTATION THUS GRANTED UNTO HIM THE BOY PROPHET COULD NOT WITHHOLD FROM RELATIVES AND ACQUAINTANCES TIDINGS OF THE HEAVENLY VISION
THE SENDING OF TROOPS TO UTAH WAS PART OF A FOUL SCHEME TO WEAKEN THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS IMPENDING STRUGGLE WITH THE SECESSIONISTS
FAIRCHILD OF OBERLIN COLLEGE AND A LITERARY FRIEND OF HIS--A MR RICE--WHILE EXAMINING A HETEROGENEOUS COLLECTION OF OLD PAPERS WHICH HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY THE GENTLEMAN LAST NAMED FOUND THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF THE STORY AFTER A CAREFUL PERUSAL AND COMPARISON WITH THE BOOK OF MORMON PRESIDENT FAIRCHILD DECLARED IN AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW YORK OBSERVER FEBRUARY 5 1885
AND IF NECESSARY HOSTAGES WERE TO BE GIVEN
TRUE THEY WERE EVEN THEN LEAVING THE NATIONAL SOIL BUT NOT OF THEIR OWN WILL
IT WAS THIS GREAT AND PRIVILEGED LABOR TO WHICH THE PROPHET MALACHI REFERRED IN HIS SOLEMN DECLARATION THAT BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD ELIJAH SHOULD BE SENT WITH THE COMMISSION TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN AND THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN TO THE FATHERS
B
AND THEY ABANDONED IN TURN ALL THEIR CITIES ESTABLISHED ALONG THE COURSE OF MIGRATION
SOMETIMES HALF A SCORE WERE INTERRED AT ONE CAMP AND OF ONE COMPANY OVER A FOURTH WERE THUS LEFT BESIDE THE PRAIRIE ROAD
BEFORE THEIR MORE POWERFUL FOES THE NEPHITES DWINDLED AND FLED
IT DID NOT FLOW SPONTANEOUSLY WITH MILK AND HONEY
SEE THE GREAT APOSTASY
BUT THE CRIES OF THE VIGOROUS INFANT WERE AT LENGTH HEEDED AND IN ANSWER TO THE SEVENTH APPEAL OF THE KIND UTAH'S STAR WAS ADDED TO THE NATION'S GALAXY
DISAPPOINTING IN ITS SIMPLICITY INDEED TO THE MIND THAT CAN FIND SATISFACTION IN MYSTERIES ALONE AND TO HIM WHOSE LOVE FOR METAPHOR SYMBOLISM AND IMAGERY ARE STRONGER THAN HIS DEVOTION TO TRUTH ITSELF WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE THUS EMBELLISHED
OF WHAT AVAIL IS BELIEF AS A MERE MENTAL ASSENT OR DENIAL
THE NEPHITES LIVED IN CITIES SOME OF WHICH ATTAINED GREAT SIZE AND WERE DISTINGUISHED BY GREAT ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY
WITHIN A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST SETTLEMENT OF UTAH PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE ESTABLISHED
THEIR CONSCIENCES WERE VOID OF OFFENSE TOWARD THEIR FELLOWS
IT REFUSES TO WEAR A NAME INDICATIVE OF DISTINCTIVE OR PECULIAR DOCTRINES
GOVERNOR CUMMING TRIED IN VAIN TO INDUCE THE PEOPLE TO REMAIN ASSURING THEM THAT THE TROOPS WOULD COMMIT NO DEPREDATIONS
AT FIRST BUT A FAMILY AFFAIR OPPOSITION TO THE WORK HAS INVOLVED SUCCESSIVELY THE TOWN THE COUNTY THE STATE THE COUNTRY AND TODAY THE MORMON QUESTION HAS BEEN ACCORDED EXTENDED CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND INDEED MOST CIVILIZED NATIONS HAVE TAKEN COGNIZANCE OF THE SAME
IN THE DAYS OF THEIR INFANCY AS A CHURCH WHILE IN THE THRALL OF POVERTY AND AMIDST THE PERSECUTION AND DIREFUL THREATS OF LAWLESS HORDES THEY LAID THE CORNERSTONE AND IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS THEREAFTER THEY CELEBRATED THE DEDICATION OF THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE A STRUCTURE AT ONCE BEAUTIFUL AND IMPOSING
IT IS ALSO TOLD HOW AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REBELLION HE ALLIED HIMSELF WITH THE CONFEDERATE FORCES ACCEPTING THE RANK OF BRIGADIER-GENERAL
BEFORE THE TROOPS REACHED THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS THE SWORN STATEMENT FROM THE CLERK OF THE SUPREME COURT OF UTAH DENYING THE CHARGES MADE BY JUDGE DRUMMOND BECAME PUBLIC PROPERTY
BLUNDERS MUST BE COVERED UP
BUT WHILE THUS DECISIVE MORMONISM IS NOT EXCLUSIVE
AND GENERAL JOHNSTON WHO COMMANDED THE ARMY IN THE WEST
IN 1910 IT WAS ISSUED IN A REVISED FORM BY THE BUREAU OF INFORMATION AT SALT LAKE CITY IN WHICH EDITION THE LECTURE STYLE OF DIRECT ADDRESS WAS CHANGED TO THE ORDINARY FORM OF ESSAY
AND THESE MORMONISM ASSERTS ARE TO BE FOUND WITH THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST
AFTER A FEW SANGUINARY ENCOUNTERS THE LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE ACCEDED TO THE DEMANDS OF THEIR ASSAILANTS AND AGREED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE FOLLOWING SPRING
NOR THE SPOILS OF WAR
AN ABSURD STORY WAS CIRCULATED AND TOOK FIRM HOLD OF THE MASSES THAT THE BOOK OF MORMON PROMISED THE WESTERN LANDS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CHURCH AND THAT THEY INTENDED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THESE LANDS BY FORCE
COLONEL COOKE THE COMMANDER OF THE MORMON BATTALION DECLARED HISTORY MAY BE SEARCHED IN VAIN FOR AN EQUAL MARCH OF INFANTRY MANY WERE DISABLED THROUGH THE SEVERITY OF THE MARCH AND NUMEROUS CASES OF SICKNESS AND DEATH WERE CHRONICLED
THAT EVEN AS THE CHRIST HAD AN EXISTENCE WITH THE FATHER BEFORE COMING TO EARTH TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF A TABERNACLE OF FLESH TO LIVE AND TO DIE AS A MAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORE-ORDAINED PLAN OF REDEMPTION SO TOO EVERY CHILD OF EARTH HAD AN EXISTENCE IN THE SPIRIT-STATE BEFORE ENTERING UPON THIS MORTAL PROBATION
CALM OBSERVERS DECLARED THAT AS THE SHEPHERD HAD GONE THE FLOCK WOULD SOON BE DISPERSED
THIS LULL IN THE STORM OF OUTRAGE THAT HAD SO LONG RAGED ABOUT THEM OFFERED A STRANGE CONTRAST TO THEIR USUAL TREATMENT
THEREFORE IT TEACHES THAT ALL THINGS PERTAINING UNTO EARTH AND UNTO MAN'S EARTHLY AFFAIRS MAY WITH PROPRIETY BE REGULATED BY EARTHLY AUTHORITY BUT THAT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY ORDINANCE RITE OR CEREMONY CLAIMED TO BE OF EFFECT BEYOND THE GRAVE A POWER GREATER THAN THAT OF MAN IS REQUISITE OR THE PERFORMANCE IS VOID
BUT THESE DREAD EXPERIENCES SEEMED TO THEM NOW LIKE A DREAM OF THE NIGHT
TO SCATTER THE FORCES BY LOCATING THEM IN WIDELY SEPARATED AND REMOTE STATIONS
GREY HEADS AND INFANT LIPS THAT SCARCELY HAD LEARNED TO LISP A WORD VIGOROUS MANHOOD AND IMMATURE YOUTH MOTHER AND MAIDEN FARED ALIKE IN THE SCENE OF CARNAGE AND THEIR BODIES WERE THROWN INTO AN OLD WELL
BUT OF WHAT USE ARE THEORIES AND PHILOSOPHIES OF RELIGION WITHOUT PRACTICAL APPLICATION
INDEED THE MORMON TEMPLES ARE RARELY USED AS PLACES OF GENERAL GATHERINGS
THE CHURCH HOLDS THAT CHILDREN ARE BORN TO EARTH IN A SINLESS STATE THAT THEY NEED NO INDIVIDUAL REDEMPTION
THE CANON OF SCRIPTURE IS FULL
ON THIS DAY ALL WERE HAPPY
WATER BAPTISM THEN BECOMES A BASIC PRINCIPLE AND THE FIRST ESSENTIAL ORDINANCE OF THE GOSPEL
FROM THE MINISTERS WHO HAD BEEN SO ENERGETIC IN THEIR EFFORTS TO CONVERT THE BOY HE RECEIVED TO HIS SURPRISE ABUSE AND RIDICULE
4
THE VISITOR MADE HIS WAY UNMOLESTED INTO WORK-SHOPS AND SMITHIES
MEN WOMEN AND EVERY CHILD THAT COULD SWING A STICK WERE CALLED TO THE RANKS IN THIS INSECT WAR
AND BEING OPPOSED THEY HAD DESTROYED SOME OF THE WAGONS AND PROVISIONS
JOHN 3:1-5 MORMONISM PROCLAIMS SOMETHING MORE THAN A HEAVEN AND A HELL TO ONE OR THE OTHER OF WHICH ALL SPIRITS OF MEN SHALL BE ASSIGNED PERHAPS ON THE BASIS OF A VERY NARROW MARGIN OF MERIT OR DEMERIT
FROM THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH THE SPIRIT OF EMIGRATION RESTED UPON THE PEOPLE
FIRST FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
THE VAN WAS ALREADY FAR ON ITS WAY TOWARD THE INVITING WILDERNESS OF THE ALL BUT UNKNOWN WEST
WE BELIEVE THAT MEN WILL BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR OWN SINS AND NOT FOR ADAM'S TRANSGRESSION
A MAN WHO ESTABLISHED A RELIGION IN THIS AGE OF FREE DEBATE WHO WAS AND IS TODAY ACCEPTED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AS A DIRECT EMISSARY FROM THE MOST HIGH--SUCH A RARE HUMAN BEING IS NOT TO BE DISPOSED OF BY PELTING HIS MEMORY WITH UNSAVORY EPITHETS
HAD THESE COLONISTS OF THE WILDERNESS NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE HATRED OF THEIR FELLOW-CITIZENS IN THIS REPUBLIC OF LIBERTY
AND THAT A REDEEMER WAS PROVIDED BEFORE THE WORLD WAS
ITS SIGNIFICANCE REACHES BEYOND THE GRAVE
FOR THE CHURCH UNDER CONSIDERATION HAS RISEN FROM THE TESTIMONY SOLEMNLY SET FORTH AND THE STARTLING DECLARATIONS MADE BY THIS PERSON WHO AT THE TIME OF HIS EARLIEST ANNOUNCEMENTS WAS A FARMER'S BOY IN THE FIRST HALF OF HIS TEENS
THE TRANSLATION AND PUBLICATION OF THE BOOK OF MORMON WERE MARKED BY MANY SCENES OF TROUBLE AND CONTENTION BUT SUCCESS ATTENDED THE UNDERTAKING AND THE FIRST EDITION OF THE WORK APPEARED IN PRINT IN 1830
SOON A GLORIOUS TEMPLE CROWNED THE HILL UP WHICH THE CITY HAD RUN IN ITS RAPID GROWTH
THE STORY OF MORMONISM CHAPTER I IN THE MINDS OF MANY PERHAPS OF THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THE SCENE OF THE MORMON DRAMA IS LAID ALMOST ENTIRELY IN UTAH
AND THERE A PETITION WAS PREPARED ASKING OF CONGRESS THE RIGHTS OF SELF-GOVERNMENT
SOLOMON SPAULDING A CLERGYMAN OF AMITY PENNSYLVANIA DIED IN 1816
LET US TAKE A RETROSPECTIVE GLANCE AT THIS UNUSUAL MAN
GOVERNOR FORD GAVE TO THE PRISONERS HIS PERSONAL GUARANTEE FOR THEIR SAFETY
WE BELIEVE IN GOD THE ETERNAL FATHER AND IN HIS SON JESUS CHRIST AND IN THE HOLY GHOST
AND WITH ALL THEIR FIGHTING THE PEOPLE FORGOT NOT TO PRAY FOR DELIVERANCE AND THEY FASTED TOO FOR THE BEST OF REASONS
AT THIS TIME THERE WERE OVER ONE THOUSAND WAGONS OF THE MORMONS ROLLING WESTWARD AND THE LINE OF MARCH SOON REACHED FROM THE MISSISSIPPI TO COUNCIL BLUFFS
THAT THE VERY ETERNAL FATHER IS A PROGRESSIVE BEING
AND HAD HE NOT PROVED HIMSELF A MOSES AYE AND A JOSHUA TOO
THOUGH HIS OPPONENTS DENY HIM THE DIVINE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HIS FRIENDS BELIEVE HE WAS CHARGED THEY ALL FRIENDS AND FOES ALIKE ADMIT THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN
AND THAT FAITH TRUST CONFIDENCE IN GOD AS THE FATHER OF MANKIND AS THE SUPREME BEING TO WHOM ALL SHALL RENDER ACCOUNT OF THEIR DEEDS AND MISDEEDS MUST LEAD TO A DESIRE TO SERVE HIM AND THUS PRODUCE REPENTANCE
THE MOB WAS COMPOSED OF APT PUPILS IN THE LEARNING OF THIS LESSON
WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE BEGINNING THE CHURCH HAD MISSIONARIES AMONG THE LAMANITES
IN SHORT THAT JUSTICE WAS DETHRONED IN UTAH AND THAT THE PEOPLE WERE IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION
A SERIES OF LECTURES ON THE PRINCIPAL DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS BY JAMES E
THIS BRIEF SUMMARY OF MORMON DOCTRINE APPEARS OVER THE SIGNATURE OF JOSEPH SMITH--THE MAN WHOM THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ACCEPT AS THE INSTRUMENT IN DIVINE HANDS OF RE-ESTABLISHING THE CHURCH OF CHRIST ON EARTH IN THIS THE DISPENSATION OF THE FULNESS OF TIMES
IN DUE TIME THESE PROMISES WERE LITERALLY FULFILLED AND THE MODERN VERSION OF THESE ANCIENT WRITINGS WAS GIVEN TO THE WORLD
IT WAS OPENLY STATED IN THE EAST THAT UTAH HAD ALLIED HERSELF WITH THE CAUSE OF SECESSION
BOTH THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE SUCCESSFULLY EFFECTED
FIVE HUNDRED MEN FIT TO BEAR ARMS TO BE DRAFTED FROM THAT CAMP
THE RESTORATION OF THIS AUTHORITY FROM HEAVEN WOULD BE NECESSARY
SUCCESSORS TO THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS WERE APPOINTED AMONG WHOM THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE RESIDENT OF UTAH
IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT AFTER MAN HAS DEVELOPED FAITH IN GOD AND HAS REPENTED OF HIS SINS HE WILL BE EAGER TO FIND A MEANS OF DEMONSTRATING HIS SINCERITY
FURTHERMORE WHAT SHALL BE THE DESTINY OF THOSE WHO THOUGH LIVING IN A TIME OF SPIRITUAL LIGHT PERHAPS HAD NOT THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING AND OBEYING THE GOSPEL REQUIREMENTS
THE INEVITABLE CATASTROPHES AND ACCIDENTS OF TRAVEL ROBBED THEM OF THEIR SUBSTANCE
SHALL RELIGION BE THE ONE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND EFFORT IN WHICH PROGRESSION IS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT GENERAL SALVATION IN THE SENSE OF REDEMPTION FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FALL COMES TO ALL WITHOUT THEIR SEEKING IT
HE ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN UNTO HIM FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MINISTRY REQUIRED
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO NAME NOR INCIDENT COMMON TO THE TWO
A COUNCIL WAS CALLED AND THE SITUATION WAS FREELY DISCUSSED
HE HASTENED TO THE GRAVEYARD THOUGH SURELY THE CITY HAD NOT BEEN DEPOPULATED BY PESTILENCE
2:3 MORMONISM CONTENDS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL FALLING AWAY FROM THE CHURCH OF CHRIST DATING FROM THE TIME IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE APOSTOLIC PERIOD
WHAT WAS THERE TO FEAR IN THE VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATION OF SIX MEN AVOWEDLY DEVOTED TO PEACEFUL PURSUITS AND BENEVOLENT PURPOSES
IT AFFIRMS THAT THERE WAS A YESTERDAY AS THERE IS A TODAY AND SHALL BE A TOMORROW IN THE DEALINGS OF GOD WITH MEN
JOSEPH SMITH CLAIMING TO BE AN INSPIRED TEACHER FACED ADVERSITY SUCH AS FEW MEN HAVE BEEN CALLED TO MEET ENJOYED A BRIEF SEASON OF PROSPERITY SUCH AS FEW MEN HAVE EVER ATTAINED AND FINALLY WENT CHEERFULLY TO A MARTYR'S DEATH
THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE ANDREW JACKSON WHILE EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE PERSECUTED PEOPLE DEPLORED HIS LACK OF POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OR NON-ADMINISTRATION OF STATE LAWS
WE ARE FELLOW-SUFFERERS
THERE WERE SPEECHES AND PICNICS AND PRAYERS
AND THESE MEN WERE SHOT TO DEATH EVEN WHILE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLIGHTED PLEDGE OF PROTECTION
6
EACH OF THEM ADDED TO THE SILENT POPULATION OF THE DESERT
IN A LECTURE BEFORE THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA HE RELATED HIS EXPERIENCE IN THIS SOMETIME ABODE OF THE SAINTS
BUT THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR BAPTISMS AND ORDINATIONS FOR SANCTIFYING PRAYER AND FOR THE MOST SACRED CEREMONIES AND RITES OF THE CHURCH PARTICULARLY IN THE VICARIOUS WORK FOR THE DEAD WHICH IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF MORMON FAITH
YOU NOW WHITE MEN HAVE BEEN DRIVEN FORTH TO THE PRAIRIES
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR BATTALION SAID BRIGHAM YOUNG TO CAPTAIN ALLEN THE MUSTER OFFICER AND IF THERE ARE NOT YOUNG MEN ENOUGH WE WILL TAKE THE OLD MEN AND IF THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH WE WILL TAKE THE WOMEN WITHIN A WEEK FROM THE TIME PRESIDENT POLK'S MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED THE ENTIRE FORCE IN ALL FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-NINE SOULS WAS ON THE MARCH TO FORT LEAVENWORTH
AND WE AVERT THE ENNUI OF THE JOURNEY BY BERATING THE RAILWAY COMPANY FOR LACK OF SPEED
BUT TO RETURN TO THE CAMP OF ISRAEL
THE SLOPES WERE COVERED WITH SAGEBRUSH RELIEVED BY PATCHES OF CHAPARRAL OAK AND SQUAW-BUSH
THE GALLANT SOLDIER ENTERED GARDENS UNCHALLENGED BY OWNER HUMAN GUARD OR WATCHFUL DOG
YOU ARE NOW GOVERNOR OF UTAH
EARLY IN 1849 A CALL HAD BEEN ISSUED TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THAT PORTION OF UPPER CALIFORNIA LYING TO THE EAST OF THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS TO MEET IN CONVENTION AT GREAT SALT LAKE CITY
THIS SHALL BE GIVEN TO THE LESS VALIANT TO MANY WHO ARE NEVERTHELESS AMONG THE WORTHY MEN OF THE EARTH BUT WHO PERCHANCE HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AS TO THE GOSPEL AND ITS REQUIREMENTS
THEY ARE IN ONE SENSE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS REGULAR COURSES OF LECTURES AND INSTRUCTION BEING MAINTAINED IN SOME OF THEM
BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS INEXORABLE IN HIS ULTIMATUM THAT AS AN ORGANIZED BODY WITH HOSTILE PURPOSE THE SOLDIERS SHOULD NOT PASS THE MOUNTAIN GATEWAY
IT IS HIS RIGHT TO PRESCRIBE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MANKIND MAY BE MADE PARTAKERS OF HIS BOUNTY AND OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE VICTORY WON BY HIM OVER DEATH AND THE GRAVE
RELIGION HAS REACHED ITS PERFECTION IN PLAN AND UNLIKE ALL OTHER SYSTEMS CONTRIVED OR ACCEPTED BY HUMAN KIND IS INCAPABLE OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH
THE PUBLISHERS
THE PRESENT PUBLICATION OF THESE TWO PRODUCTIONS IS MADE IN RESPONSE TO A STEADY DEMAND
A MILITARY ORGANIZATION THE NAUVOO LEGION WAS AUTHORIZED AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIVERSITY WAS PROVIDED FOR
SILVER LAKE A MOUNTAIN GEM SET AMIDST THE SNOWS AND FORESTS AND TOWERING PEAKS OF THE COTTONWOODS HAD BEEN SELECTED AS A FITTING SITE FOR THE FESTIVITIES
FOR MANY MONTHS OMINOUS RUMBLINGS HAD BEEN HEARD,--INDICATIONS OF THE GATHERING STORM WHICH WAS SOON TO BREAK IN THE AWFUL FURY OF CIVIL STRIFE
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT WAR WAS ABOUT TO BREAK UPON THEM
WE BELIEVE ALL THAT GOD HAS REVEALED ALL THAT HE DOES NOW REVEAL AND WE BELIEVE THAT HE WILL YET REVEAL MANY GREAT AND IMPORTANT THINGS PERTAINING TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR IT DIFFERS FROM CHURCHES CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT PRESBYTERIAN CONGREGATIONALIST UNITARIAN METHODIST AND BAPTIST
IT COULD NOT BE DOUBTED THAT WAR WAS IMMINENT
I BELIEVE THAT STRATEGY IS USUALLY ALLOWED IN WAR AND I AM FREE TO SAY THE MORMONS AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THIS LICENSE
IN OCTOBER 1838 THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI THE SAME LILBURN W
WE HAVE A RECORD OF APOSTLES PARTICULARLY NUMBERING TWELVE AND BESIDE THESE SEVENTY OTHERS WHO WERE COMMISSIONED TO PREACH TEACH BAPTIZE AND PERFORM OTHER ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
WHAT WOULD WE SAY OF THE CHEMIST THE ASTRONOMER THE PHYSICIST OR THE GEOLOGIST WHO WOULD PROCLAIM THAT NO FURTHER DISCOVERY OR REVELATION OF SCIENTIFIC TRUTH IS POSSIBLE OR WHO WOULD DECLARE THAT THE ONLY OCCUPATION OPEN TO STUDENTS OF SCIENCE IS TO CON THE BOOKS OF BY-GONE TIMES AND TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES LONG AGO MADE KNOWN SINCE NONE OTHERS SHALL EVER BE DISCOVERED
THIS WORTHY REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COUNTRY'S SERVICE WAS CHALLENGED BY THE DRUNKEN CROWD AND MADE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AND TO ANSWER FOR HAVING CROSSED THE RIVER WITHOUT A PERMIT FROM THE HEAD OF THE BAND
YET THE REGION WAS SO WILD AND FORBIDDING THAT SCARCELY A WOLF VENTURED THERE TO GLUT ITSELF UPON THE CARCASSES
HE IS LORD OF LIVING AND DEAD AS MAN USES THESE TERMS FOR ALL LIVE UNTO HIM
BUT THE ORIGIN OF THE SYSTEM MUST BE SOUGHT IN REGIONS FAR DISTANT FROM THE PRESENT GATHERING-PLACE OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS AND AT A PERIOD ANTEDATING THE ACQUISITION OF UTAH AS A PART OF OUR NATIONAL DOMAIN
AND VERILY IT SEEMS THAT IN THE FLESH HE HAS TO SUFFER FOR THE SINS OF HIS PROGENITORS
HE PROMPTLY REPORTED HIS CONCLUSIONS TO GENERAL JOHNSTON THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER NEED FOR THE ARMY
AFTER OVER THREE MONTHS JOURNEYING THE PIONEER COMPANY REACHED THE VALLEY OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE
EVERY YEAR COME THESE GRACEFUL CREATURES TO SPEND THE SPRINGTIME IN THE FIELDS AND UPON THE LAKES OF UTAH
I HAVE A CONSCIENCE VOID OF OFFENSE AND SHALL DIE INNOCENT THE MORMON PEOPLE REGARDED IT AS A DUTY TO MAKE EVERY PROPER EFFORT TO BRING THE PERPETRATORS OF THE FOUL ASSASSINATION OF THEIR LEADERS TO JUSTICE
THOUGH FEW ADMIT THE ENTIRE DISCONTINUANCE OF PRIESTLY POWER OR THE FULL SUSPENSION OF AUTHORITY TO OPERATE IN THE ORDINANCES OF THE CHURCH
LET BOASTING MURDERERS OF BEGGING AND HELPLESS INFANCY ANSWER
AND MOREOVER THAT THE INSPIRED SCRIPTURES FORETOLD JUST SUCH A CONDITION.[5 FOOTNOTE 5
TRUE IT IS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORMONISM IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HISTORY OF THE LONG-TIME TERRITORY AND PRESENT STATE OF UTAH
HIS COMING BEING MADE KNOWN TO GOVERNOR YOUNG AN ESCORT WAS SENT TO MEET HIM AND CONDUCT HIM THROUGH THE MORMON LINES
FOUR OTHERS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN THE VALES OF UTAH AND ARE TODAY IN SERVICE DEDICATED TO THE BLESSING OF THE LIVING AND PARTICULARLY TO THE VICARIOUS LABOR OF THE LIVING IN BEHALF OF THE DEAD
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OF MOSES OF PAUL OF APOLLOS AND OF ANY ONE OF A MULTITUDE OF OTHERS BUT NOT OF THE CHRIST
BANDS PLAYED
AND ONE OF THE EARLY ACTS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS TO GRANT A CHARTER TO THE DESERET UNIVERSITY NOW KNOWN AS THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH
IN HIS LAST LETTER TO THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY-GENERAL HE DECLARED THAT HIS LIFE WAS NO LONGER SAFE IN UTAH AND THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO FLEE FROM HIS BENCH
THERE IS NO CHANCE IN THE NUMBER OR NATURE OF SPIRITS THAT ARE BORN TO EARTH
WE BELIEVE IN BEING HONEST TRUE CHASTE BENEVOLENT VIRTUOUS AND IN DOING GOOD TO ALL MEN
IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
WHEN THE CHRIST CAME IN THE FLESH HE DECLARED THAT HE ACTED NOT OF HIMSELF BUT ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN HIM OF THE FATHER
E
FALLING UPON THE PEOPLE'S FOES THEY DEVOURED THEM BY THE THOUSAND AND WHEN FILLED TO REPLETION DISGORGED AND FEASTED AGAIN
AS IT AFFIRMS THE EXISTENCE OF AN INFINITE RANGE OF GRADED INTELLIGENCES SO IT CLAIMS THE WIDEST AND FULLEST GRADATION OF CONDITIONS OF FUTURE EXISTENCE
FOR ONE STAR DIFFERETH FROM ANOTHER STAR IN GLORY
AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOVERNORS JUDGES AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OF THE TERRITORY AND LATER THAT OF THE OFFICERS OF THE STATE HAVE DECLARED THE SINCERITY OF THE RENUNCIATION
OPPOSITION PERSECUTION AND MARTYRDOM HAVE BEEN ITS PORTION BUT THESE TRIBULATIONS IT ACCEPTS KNOWING WELL THAT TO BEAR SUCH HAS BEEN THE LOT OF THE TRUE CHURCH IN EVERY AGE
FAITH IN GOD AND GENUINE REPENTANCE OF SIN OF NECESSITY THEREFORE CONSTITUTE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL
IT WAS SOON APPARENT THAT THEY NEED FEAR NO MORMON ATTACK
BUT THE KINSHIP OF FATHER AND OFFSPRING
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THE SOUNDING OF BRASS OR THE TINKLING OF WORDY CYMBALS IN THE FERVENT ADMONITION OF THE CHRIST TO HIS FOLLOWERS--"BE YE THEREFORE PERFECT EVEN AS YOUR FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN IS PERFECT MATT
THE MANUSCRIPT HAS BEEN PRINTED TWICE AT LEAST;--ONCE BY THE MORMONS OF SALT LAKE CITY AND ONCE BY THE JOSEPHITE MORMONS OF IOWA
BUT MOST OF THESE WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE EASTERLY SIDE OF THE RIVER
UP TO 1849 UTAH HAD NO POLITICAL HISTORY
FOR TO ASSERT SUCH WOULD BE TO ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO PROGRESSION BEYOND A CERTAIN STAGE OF ATTAINMENT AND THAT ADVANCEMENT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF LOW ORGANIZATION AND INFERIOR PURPOSE ALONE
IF IT WAS CIVILIZATION THE WANDERERS HAD LEFT THEN INDEED MIGHT THE RED MEN OF THE FOREST HAVE FELT PROUD OF THEIR DISTINCTION
IN READING THE EARLIEST PAGES OF MORMON HISTORY WE ARE INTRODUCED TO A MAN WHOSE NAME WILL EVER BE PROMINENT IN THE STORY OF THE CHURCH--THE FOUNDER OF THE ORGANIZATION BY COMMON USAGE OF THE TERM THE HEAD OF THE SYSTEM AS AN EARTHLY ESTABLISHMENT--ONE WHO IS ACCEPTED BY THE CHURCH AS AN AMBASSADOR SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED OF GOD TO BE THE FIRST REVELATOR OF THE LATTER-DAY DISPENSATION
THESE ARE OF THE COLOR THAT BETOKENS PEACE
WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND UNDER COVER OF SECRECY SO THAT THE UTAH REBELS MIGHT BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE THE ARMY SET OUT ON THE MARCH
THOUGH IDOLATRY HAS BEEN MARKED FROM THE EARLIEST AGES WITH THE SEAL OF DIVINE DISFAVOR IT MAY REPRESENT IN THE UNENLIGHTENED SOUL THE SINCEREST REVERENCE OF WHICH THE PERSON IS CAPABLE
BUT IN A SUBURBAN CORNER HE CAME ACROSS THE SMOLDERING EMBERS OF A BARBECUE FIRE WITH FRAGMENTS OF FLESH AND OTHER REMNANTS OF A FEAST
WE BELIEVE THAT THE DAY SHALL YET COME WHEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD ON EARTH SHALL BE ONE WITH THE KINGDOM IN HEAVEN
WHICH EXPANSION OF THE WORK WAS INAUGURATED BY THE CONVERSION OF THE DEVOUT CORNELIUS AND HIS HOUSEHOLD
I WHO WRITE HAVE LISTENED TO JUDGES INSTRUCTING GRAND JURIES IN SUCH TERMS AS THESE
WADING THE STREAMS WITH CARTS IN TOW OR IN CASES OF UNFORDABLE STREAMS STOPPING TO CONSTRUCT RAFTS
VAN BUREN REPLIED IN WORDS THAT WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN YOUR CAUSE IS JUST BUT I CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU THE PEACEFUL CONDITIONS AT FIRST CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIR ILLINOIS SETTLEMENT WERE NOT TO CONTINUE
MANY OF THE TROOPS HAD ALMOST PERISHED IN THE STORMS FOR IT WAS LATE IN NOVEMBER AND THE WINTER HAD CLOSED IN EARLY
IT SEEMED TO NESTLE THERE AS IF THE FATHER OF WATERS WAS ENCIRCLING IT WITH HIS MIGHTY ARM
BUT STRANGERS WHO KNEW NOT THE PEOPLE NOR THEIR WAYS FILLED WITH PREJUDICE FROM THE FALSE REPORTS THEY HAD HEARD CAME FROM THE EAST TO GOVERN THE COLONISTS IN THE DESERT
CHOIRS SANG
BUT AS SOON AS WORD OF THIS INFAMOUS CHARGE REACHED SALT LAKE CITY THE CLERK OF THE COURT JUDGE DRUMMOND'S CLERK SENT A LETTER BY EXPRESS TO THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL DENYING UNDER OATH THE JUDGE'S STATEMENTS AND ATTESTING THE DECLARATION WITH OFFICIAL SEAL
HOUSES WERE FIRED WHILE THE TENANTS WERE WRAPPED IN UNEASY SLUMBER WITHIN
THE SWORD IS NEVER OFFERED AS THEIR SYMBOL OF CONQUEST
BY JAMES E
BUT THAT EACH HAS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES
IT IS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY ONE HAVING AUTHORITY
THAT WORD SERVED BUT TO RECALL THE DEGRADED TRIBES WHO HAD CONTESTED THE SETTLEMENT OF THE VALLEYS
FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM RESTS ON THE LITERAL ACCEPTANCE OF A LIVING PERSONAL GOD AND ON THE UNRESERVED COMPLIANCE WITH HIS LAW AS FROM TIME TO TIME REVEALED
HE'LL CALL PERSUADE DIRECT ARIGHT BLESS HIM WITH WISDOM LOVE AND LIGHT
THE CELESTIAL VISITOR STATED THAT THROUGH JOSEPH AS THE EARTHLY AGENT THE LORD WOULD ACCOMPLISH A GREAT WORK AND THAT THE BOY WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN BY GOOD AND EVIL REPUTE AMONGST ALL NATIONS
THE TRUE ACCOUNT OF ITS ORIGIN WAS REJECTED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO THUS ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EXPLAINING IN SOME PLAUSIBLE WAY THE SOURCE OF THE RECORD
YOURS VERY TRULY JAMES H
FOR GENERATIONS HIS ANCESTORS HAD BEEN LABORERS BY OCCUPATION TILLERS OF THE SOIL
ALREADY WERE THEY ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE COUNTRY THAT THEY HAD REGARDED AS THE LAND OF PROMISED LIBERTY
TRUE TOLERATION IS ONE OF ITS ESSENTIAL FEATURES
YET THE TWO HAVE OFTEN BEEN CONFUSED IN THE POPULAR MIND
HOLY MEN OF OLD SPAKE AND WROTE AS THEY WERE MOVED UPON BY THE HOLY GHOST AND DEPENDED NOT UPON THE PRECEDENTS OF ANCIENT HISTORY NOR ENTIRELY UPON THE LAW THEN ALREADY WRITTEN
IN MAN'S INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HIS DOINGS
NAUVOO WAS DESERTED HER 20,000 INHABITANTS EXPATRIATED
THOUGH UNTIL THE COMING OF THE KING THERE IS NO AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH EXERCISING OR CLAIMING TEMPORAL RULE OR DOMINION AMONG THE GOVERNMENTS OF EARTH
HERE TOO THEIR PROVISIONS WERE WELL NIGH EXHAUSTED
THE CHURCH CLAIMS THAT FAITH IN GOD IS ESSENTIAL TO INTELLIGENT SERVICE OF HIM
J
OUR VERY TEMPLES HAVE BEEN DESECRATED AND DESTROYED BY THEM
BY REVELATION SAUL OF TARSUS BECAME PAUL THE APOSTLE A VALIANT DEFENDER OF THE FAITH
AN OFFICIAL EDICT OFFERING EXPATRIATION OR DEATH TO A PEACEABLE COMMUNITY WITH NO CRIME PROVED AGAINST THEM AND GUILTY OF NO OFFENSE OTHER THAN THAT OF CHOOSING TO DIFFER IN OPINION FROM THE MASSES
BUT WHAT WAS THERE INVITING IN THIS WILDERNESS SPREAD OUT LIKE A SCROLL BARREN OF INVITING MESSAGE AND EMPTY BUT FOR THE PICTURE IT PRESENTED OF WONDROUS SCENIC GRANDEUR
IN THE BLACK HILLS REGION THE PIONEERS WERE DELAYED A WEEK AT THE PLATTE A STREAM WHICH THOUGH USUALLY FORDABLE AT THIS POINT WAS NOW SO SWOLLEN AS TO MAKE FORDING IMPOSSIBLE
HE RECEIVED FOUR BULLETS AND WAS LEFT SUPPOSEDLY DEAD
IF ON THE OTHER HAND SUCH DECLARATIONS BE TRUE THERE IS LITTLE CAUSE TO WONDER AT THE PHENOMENALLY RAPID RISE AND THE SURPRISING STABILITY OF THE EDIFICE SO BEGUN
WE HOLD THAT THE DOCTRINE OF CONTINUOUS REVELATION FROM GOD IS NOT LESS PHILOSOPHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC THAN SCRIPTURAL
IT DEMANDS THE ORGANIZATION AND THE AUTHORITY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH IN FORMER DAYS WHEN THERE WAS A CHURCH OF GOD UPON THE EARTH
THE PEOPLE WERE BESOUGHT TO TAKE SIDES WITH THE SOUTH IN THE AWFUL SCENES OF CRUEL STRIFE
ALREADY WOMEN AND BOYS HAD BEEN PRESSED INTO SERVICE TO DO THE WORK OF MEN
NOW WE TRAVERSE THE SELF-SAME TRACK IN A DAY AND A NIGHT RECLINING ON LUXURIOUS CUSHIONS OF EASE COVERING FIFTY MILES WHILE DINING IN LUXURY
KNOW THIS THAT EVERY SOUL IS FREE TO CHOOSE HIS LIFE AND WHAT HE'LL BE
FROM THAT TIME TO THE PRESENT THE STREAM OF IMMIGRATION TO THESE VALLEYS HAS NEVER CEASED
THE BOOK TELLS OF THE JOURNEYINGS ACROSS THE WATER IN VESSELS CONSTRUCTED ACCORDING TO REVEALED PLAN OF THE PEOPLES LANDING ON THE WESTERN SHORES OF SOUTH AMERICA PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN CHILE OF THEIR PROSPERITY AND RAPID GROWTH AMID THE BOUNTEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE NEW WORLD OF THE INCREASE OF PRIDE AND CONSEQUENT DISSENSION ACCOMPANYING THE ACCUMULATION OF MATERIAL WEALTH AND OF THE DIVISION OF THE PEOPLE INTO FACTIONS WHICH BECAME LATER TWO GREAT NATIONS AT ENMITY WITH ONE ANOTHER
IT WAS THE CALL OF THEIR COUNTRY
AND THESE STORIES CALLED UP IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HEARD THE DREAD SCENES OF FAR WEST AND NAUVOO
THE MORMONS ENGAGED ABLE LAWYERS TO INSTITUTE AND MAINTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THEIR FOES AND THIS STEP THE RIGHT TO WHICH ONE WOULD THINK COULD BE DENIED NO AMERICAN CITIZEN CALLED FORTH SUCH AN UPROAR OF POPULAR WRATH AS TO AFFECT ALMOST THE ENTIRE STATE
THE GOSPEL AS UNDERSTOOD BY THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS AFFIRMS THE UNCONDITIONAL FREE-AGENCY OF MAN--HIS RIGHT TO ACCEPT GOOD OR EVIL TO CHOOSE THE MEANS OF ETERNAL PROGRESSION OR THE OPPOSITE TO WORSHIP AS HE ELECTS OR TO REFUSE TO WORSHIP AT ALL--AND THEN TO TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS CHOICE
SUCH RELIEF CAME FROM THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES DESTITUTE AND ALMOST STARVING
THE MORMON PEOPLE REGARD THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THEIR CHURCH AS THE CULMINATION OF A GREAT SERIES OF NOTABLE EVENTS
IN THE RIGHTS OF WORSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF CONSCIENCE
THE ARMY WINTERED AT A SATISFACTORY DISTANCE FROM SALT LAKE CITY AND SUCH A WINTER ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS THE SOLDIERS OF OUR NATION HAVE RARELY HAD TO BRAVE
BUT THE WANDERERS WERE NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT FRIENDS
WAS IT THE MORMONS IS IT NOT NOTORIOUS ON THE CONTRARY THAT THEY WERE HUNTED LIKE WILD BEASTS FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY BEFORE THEY MADE ANY RESISTANCE
BUT ON THE CONTRARY THE EVIDENCE IS COMPLETE THAT IN EVERY STAGE OF THE CHURCH'S HISTORY THE GOD OF HEAVEN COMMUNICATED HIS MIND AND WILL UNTO HIS EARTHLY REPRESENTATIVES
THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS PROFESSES TO HAVE THE PRIESTHOOD OF OLD RESTORED IN ITS FULNESS
BUT LET US TURN MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH ITSELF
THIS MAN IS JOSEPH SMITH COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE MORMON PROPHET
ON THE CARPENTER'S BENCH WAS THE UNFINISHED FRAME ON THE FLOOR WERE THE SHAVINGS FRESH AND ODOROUS
RELIEF TRAINS WERE CONTINUALLY ON THE WAY BETWEEN THE VALLEY OF THE SALT LAKE AND THE MISSOURI
BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON"-HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
BUT TOOLS WERE NOT WANTING AS INDEED THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN FOR MURDER AND ITS KINDRED OUTRAGES
THE CHURCH SOON FOUND ITS EQUILIBRIUM AGAIN AFTER THE SHOCK OF ITS CRUEL EXPERIENCE
BUT THE GOLD-SEEKERS HASTENING WESTWARD AND THE SUCCESSFUL MINERS RETURNING EASTWARD HALTED AT THE MORMON SETTLEMENTS AND THERE REPLENISHED THEIR SUPPLIES LEAVING THEIR GOLD TO ENRICH THE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT
BUT MORMONISM DIED NOT
HE WAS FORMERLY STATE PRINTER AT COLUMBUS OHIO AND BEFORE THAT PUBLISHER OF A PAPER IN PAINESVILLE WHOSE PRECEDING PUBLISHER HAD VISITED MRS SPAULDING AND OBTAINED THE MANUSCRIPT FROM HER
THEY DROVE THE MARAUDERS INTO TRENCHES THERE TO BE DROWNED OR BURNED
VITALIZE IT
BUT SUCH CONVICTION GIVES ME NO SEMBLANCE OF RIGHT FOR INTERFERING WITH HIS EXERCISE OF FREEDOM
AND THE CHURCH MUST BE IN DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM OF WHICH THE EARTHLY KINGDOM WHEN ESTABLISHED SHALL BE A PART
CHAPTER III SETTLING IN AND ABOUT THE OBSCURE VILLAGE OF COMMERCE THE MORMON REFUGEES SOON DEMONSTRATED ANEW THE MARVELOUS RECUPERATIVE POWER WITH WHICH THEY WERE ENDOWED AND A CITY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM THE EARTH
CONCERNING THE PERIOD OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT SUCH MEN AS GUNNISON STANSBURY AND OTHER FEDERAL OFFICIALS ON DUTY IN THE WEST HAVE RECORDED THEIR PRAISES OF THE MORMON COLONISTS IN OFFICIAL REPORTS
THE STARS AND STRIPES STREAMED ABOVE THE CAMP
SALT LAKE CITY UTAH 1912 TO THE FERVENT LATTER-DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
THUS IN 1829 JOSEPH SMITH AND OLIVER COWDERY RECEIVED THE LESSER OR AARONIC PRIESTHOOD UNDER THE HANDS OF JOHN THE BAPTIST WHO VISITED THEM AS A RESURRECTED BEING--THE SAME BAPTIST WHO BY SPECIAL AND DIVINE COMMISSION HELD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRIESTHOOD IN THE DISPENSATION OF THE MERIDIAN OF TIME LATER THE HIGHER OR MELCHIZEDEK PRIESTHOOD WAS CONFERRED UPON THEM THROUGH THE PERSONAL MINISTRATIONS OF PETER JAMES AND JOHN--THE SAME THREE WHO CONSTITUTED THE PRESIDENCY OF THE APOSTOLIC BODY IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST BY WHOM IT WAS FOUNDED

HOWEVER FAR IN THE FUTURE IT MAY BE WHAT AGES MAY ELAPSE WHAT ETERNITIES MAY PASS BEFORE ANY INDIVIDUAL NOW A MORTAL BEING MAY ATTAIN THE RANK AND SANCTITY OF GODSHIP MAN NEVERTHELESS CARRIES IN HIS SOUL THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENT
THEN IT BECOMES A MOVING POWER
AND MANY GRAVES MARKED THE PATH THEY HAD TRAVERSED WHOSE TENANTS HAD PASSED TO THEIR LAST SLEEP THROUGH LACK OF CARE
AND THAT THE PREACHER OF THE WORD MUST BE OTHERWISE ENDOWED THAN BY THE LEARNING OF THE SCHOOLMEN
THE UNPREJUDICED STUDENT SEES IN THE DISCOVERIES OF THE ANCIENT AND NOW FOREST-COVERED CITIES OF MEXICO CENTRAL AMERICA YUCATAN AND THE NORTHERN REGIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA COLLATERAL TESTIMONY HAVING A BEARING UPON THIS HISTORY
THIRD BAPTISM BY IMMERSION FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS
YET A STORM OF PERSECUTION WAS THREATENED FROM THE EARLIEST DAY
BUT MOST OF THE MEN CHOSE TO REJOIN THEIR FAMILIES AS SOON AS THEY COULD SECURE THEIR HONORABLE DISCHARGE
PROVISIONS WERE CACHED
NAUVOO--THE CITY BEAUTIFUL--WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO THIS NEW ABIDING PLACE
IT DISTINGUISHES NOT BETWEEN ENLIGHTENED AND HEATHEN NATIONS NOR BETWEEN MEN OF HIGH AND LOW INTELLIGENCE
IT IS FOUNDED ON THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST WHICH ANTEDATES THIS EARTH
THE NATIONAL OFFICIALS COULD DO NOTHING
THESE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNATED SPECIFICALLY THE FIRST PRINCIPLES AND ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL MORMONISM CLAIMS TO BE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO MEMBERSHIP IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST AND THIS WITHOUT MODIFICATION OR QUALIFICATION AS TO THE TIME AT WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL LIVED IN MORTALITY
THEY HAD HALTED BETWEEN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND THAT OF THE WEST THEY HAD FLED FROM THE COUNTRY THAT REFUSED THEM A HOME AND NOW THE NATION WOULD EJECT THEM FROM THEIR DESERT LODGINGS
HAVE ANY WHO PLUNDERED AND OPENLY INSULTED THE MORMONS EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO THEIR CRIMES
NO ONE CAN SEE IT AND QUESTION ITS GENUINENESS
LET US LEAVE THE SOLDIERS ON THEIR WESTWARD MARCH AND ASCERTAIN HOW THE NEWS OF THE PROJECTED INVASION REACHED THE PEOPLE OF UTAH AND WHAT EFFECT THE TIDINGS PRODUCED
LET IT NOT BE THOUGHT THAT ALL THE PEOPLE OF ILLINOIS WERE THEIR FRIENDS
FOR SUCH HIGH CLAIMS COMBINED WITH SUCH PROFESSIONS OF TOLERANCE THE CHURCH HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF INCONSISTENCY
TO MANY OF THEM ALL CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS COULD AND PROFESSEDLY DO SUBSCRIBE
AND AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF IT BRIGHAM YOUNG DECLARED IT TO BE THE HALTING PLACE--THE GATHERING CENTER FOR THE SAINTS
THE PRESENT OR THIRD AMERICAN EDITION HAS BEEN REVISED AND AMPLIFIED BY THE AUTHOR
MONTHS PASSED HOWEVER BEFORE THE NEWS OF THE CHANGE REACHED THE WEST
THE SURPRISE WHICH THE MESSAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICER PRODUCED IN THE CAMP AMOUNTED ALMOST TO DISMAY
THE CHURCH IS REGARDED AS THE BEGINNING OF THIS KINGDOM ON EARTH
AND AMID SUCH ENVIRONMENT THE SPIRIT WAS PLUMING ITSELF FOR FLIGHT
BUT THE GREATER PART OF THE PLATES SINCE TRANSLATED HAD BEEN ENGRAVED BY THE FATHER OF MORONI THE NEPHITE PROPHET MORMON
CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF SCRIPTURAL AND SECULAR HISTORY BY JAMES E
THEY OPERATED UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT THE LIVING CHURCH MUST BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH ITS LIVING HEAD
AND EVERYTHING THE SETTLERS COULD SPARE WAS EAGERLY BOUGHT AT AN UNUSUAL PRICE
NO DESIGNATION COULD BE MORE MISLEADING AND IN EVERY WAY MORE UNTRUTHFUL
HE LEFT UTAH IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE REBELLION TURNED HIS ARMS AGAINST THE FLAG HE HAD SWORN TO DEFEND DOFFED THE BLUE DONNED THE GREY AND FELL A REBEL ON THE FIELD OF SHILOH
ONE PART FOLLOWING NEPHI THE YOUNGEST AND MOST GIFTED SON OF LEHI DESIGNATED THEMSELVES NEPHITES
FOURTH LAYING ON OF HANDS FOR THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST
THEN AND THERE HE BESTOWED THE AUTHORITY FOR THIS DISPENSATION TO INAUGURATE AND CARRY ON THIS LABOR IN BEHALF OF THE DEPARTED
HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER BUT NOT COMPELLED TO RENDER WORSHIP WHICH TO HIM IS FALSE BECAUSE IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSCIENCE
IN A GENERAL AND TRUE SENSE MORMONISM IS NOT NEW TO THE WORLD
THE WOOD WAS PILED IN READINESS BEFORE THE BAKER'S OVEN
THE CHIEF MOTIVE IMPELLING TO RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION IS THE CONVICTION THAT TO KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM THERE IS NO END
BUT WHITHER SHOULD THEY GO
HE TRIED IN VAIN TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY PRESENTED TO HIM IN THE WARRING FACTIONS OF WHAT PROFESSED TO BE THE CHURCH OF CHRIST
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE SUSPENDED THE PRACTISE OF PLURAL MARRIAGE
MORMONISM RECOGNIZES JESUS CHRIST AS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH AS THE LITERAL SAVIOR AND REDEEMER OF MANKIND AS THE KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS AS THE ONE WHOSE RIGHT IT IS TO REIGN ON EARTH WHO SHALL YET SUBDUE ALL WORLDLY KINGDOMS UNDER HIS FEET WHO SHALL PRESENT THE EARTH IN ITS FINAL STATE OF REDEMPTION TO THE FATHER
ITS SOLE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES ARE THOSE OF THE CHURCH OF CHRIST
BUT HOW LONG DID THEY HESITATE
AND THERE EXISTED IN THE MINDS OF UNPREJUDICED OBSERVERS NOT A DOUBT AS TO ITS VITALITY
WE BELIEVE IN BEING SUBJECT TO KINGS PRESIDENTS RULERS AND MAGISTRATES IN OBEYING HONORING AND SUSTAINING THE LAW
THE NEW GOVERNOR CALLED UPON THE CLERK OF THE COURT AND ASCERTAINED THE TRUTH OF THE STATEMENT THAT THE RECORDS WERE ENTIRELY SAFE
ORDERS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THE TERRITORIAL MILITIA TO TAKE NO LIFE EXCEPT IN CASES OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
MANY MAY CALL IT SUPERSTITION BUT SOME WILL REGARD IT AS DID THE THANKFUL TRAVELERS--AN INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE AND AN ANSWER TO THEIR PRAYERS--AN EVENT TO BE COMPARED THEY SAID TO THE FEEDING OF ISRAEL WITH MANNA IN THE WILDERNESS OF OLD
EVERY READER OF RECENT AND CURRENT HISTORY HAS LEARNED OF HER RAPID GROWTH
ITS ALTARS OF PRAYER WERE BROKEN
HAD THEY NOT SEEN LO THESE MANY TIMES ORGANIZED BATTALIONS AND COMPANIES SURPASSING FIENDISH MOBS IN VILLAINY
WE BELIEVE IN THE SAME ORGANIZATION THAT EXISTED IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH NAMELY APOSTLES PROPHETS PASTORS TEACHERS EVANGELISTS ETC
IT IS TO THE PEOPLE THE TRUE STICK OF EPHRAIM WHICH EZEKIEL DECLARED SHOULD BECOME ONE WITH THE STICK OF JUDAH"--OR THE BIBLE
PERSONAL OUTRAGES WERE OF EVERY-DAY OCCURRENCE
HOWEVER IT WAS KNOWN THAT CERTAIN OF HIS CABINET WERE IN LEAGUE WITH THE SECEDING STATES
SAFE CONDUCT WAS ASSURED ANY AND ALL OFFICERS WHO CHOSE TO ENTER THE CITY
WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH--OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
SCARCELY AN HOUR

WHILE OTHERS COMPARABLE ONLY TO WOLVES THINKING THE FOLD UNGUARDED SOUGHT TO HARRY AND SCATTER THE SHEEP
DID EITHER THE PULPIT OR THE PRESS THROUGH THE STATE RAISE A NOTE OF REMONSTRANCE OR ALARM
JOSEPH SMITH WAS BORN AT SHARON VERMONT IN DECEMBER 1805
HOSTILE SAVAGES STAMPEDED THEIR CATTLE OR OPENLY ATTACKED AND PLUNDERED THE TRAINS
AND FOR THIS THEY ACCEPTED THE PRESIDENT'S MOST GRACIOUS PARDON
HE FURTHER EXPLAINED THAT WITH THE PLATES WERE TWO SACRED STONES KNOWN AS URIM AND THUMMIM BY THE USE OF WHICH THE LORD WOULD BRING FORTH A TRANSLATION OF THE ANCIENT RECORD
WHEN THE HISTORY OF THAT GREAT STRUGGLE WITH ITS ANTECEDENT AND ITS CONSEQUENT CIRCUMSTANCES IS WRITTEN WITH A PEN THAT SHALL INDITE NAUGHT BUT TRUTH WHEN PREJUDICE AND PARTISANSHIP ARE LIVED DOWN IT MAY APPEAR THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS RATHER THAN JAMES BUCHANAN WAS THE PRIME CAUSE OF THE GREAT MISTAKE
HYRUM FELL FIRST
IT APPEARED LATER IN THE COLUMNS OF THE IMPROVEMENT ERA AND TRANSLATIONS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN PAMPHLET FORM IN THE DANISH AND GERMAN LANGUAGES
IT ASSERTS THAT EVEN THE HEATHEN DEVOTEE WHO MAY HAVE BOWED DOWN TO STOCKS AND STONES IF IN SO DOING HE WAS OBEYING THE HIGHEST LAW OF WORSHIP WHICH TO HIS BENIGHTED SOUL HAD COME SHALL HAVE PART IN THE FIRST RESURRECTION AND SHALL BE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH ON EARTH HE HAD NOT FOUND OF DOING THAT WHICH IS REQUIRED OF GOD'S CHILDREN FOR SALVATION
FANATICS THEY MAY BE TO MULTITUDES WHO LIKE THE PROUD PHARISEE OF OLD THANK GOD THEY ARE NOT AS THESE
NONE INDEED HAD IT NEVER BEEN TAKEN AWAY
THE PLANTING SEASON HAD ALREADY WELL NIGH PASSED AND NOT A DAY COULD BE LOST
485 PP 1
A FEW DAYS LATER HE WENT BEFORE HIS FELLOW-SUFFERER ECKLES THE APPOINTEE FOR CHIEF JUSTICE OF UTAH AND TOOK AN OATH
ITS OBLIGATIONS ARE ETERNAL
CUMMING THE GOVERNOR-TO-BE ISSUED A PROCLAMATION FROM HIS DUG-OUT LODGINGS AND SENT IT TO SALT LAKE CITY BY COURIER
THE HISTORICAL PART OF THE JEWISH SCRIPTURES TELLS OF THE DIVINE DEALINGS WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE
AND THAT SURELY IN THE RENDERING OF DIVINE JUDGMENT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EACH SOUL HAS LIVED IN MORTALITY SHALL BE CONSIDERED
WE ARE TOLD OF THE INAUGURATION OF THIS GREAT MISSIONARY LABOR IN THE SPIRIT WORLD AS EFFECTED BY THE CHRIST HIMSELF
THE ANGEL THEN ANNOUNCED THAT AN ANCIENT RECORD ENGRAVEN ON PLATES OF GOLD LAY HIDDEN IN A HILL NEAR BY WHICH RECORD GAVE A HISTORY OF THE NATIONS THAT HAD OF OLD INHABITED THE AMERICAN CONTINENT AND AN ACCOUNT OF THE SAVIOR'S MINISTRATIONS AMONG THEM
IT WAS ON THE 24TH OF JULY 1847 THAT THE MAIN PART OF THE PIONEER BAND ENTERED THE VALLEY OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE AND THAT DAY OF THE YEAR IS OBSERVED AS A LEGAL HOLIDAY IN UTAH
AND A HOST NUMBERING FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND INCLUDING MANY WOMEN AND CHILDREN ABANDONED THEIR HOMES AND FLED BEFORE THEIR MURDEROUS PURSUERS REDDENING THE SNOW WITH BLOODY FOOTPRINTS AS THEY JOURNEYED
THE TESTIMONY OF THIS LAD IS THAT IN RESPONSE TO HIS SUPPLICATION DRAWN FORTH BY THE ADMONITION OF AN INSPIRED APOSTLE HE RECEIVED A DIVINE MINISTRATION
THAT ZION WILL BE BUILT UPON THIS THE AMERICAN CONTINENT
FROM THE FIRST OPPOSITION WAS MANIFEST BUT THEIR CONDITION WAS SO GREATLY BETTERED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THE ADVENT OF THEIR ZION TO BE NEAR AT HAND
JOSEPH SMITH HAD BEEN MORE THAN THE ECCLESIASTICAL LEADER
KANE A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE AT THIS STAGE OF OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY WAS TRAVELING EASTWARD AT THE TIME AND REACHED NAUVOO SHORTLY AFTER ITS EVACUATION
A MORE FORSAKEN SPOT THEY HAD NOT PASSED IN ALL THEIR WANDERINGS
EVERYWHERE WERE MARKS OF THEIR BRUTISH ACTS
IT IS NEW ONLY AS THE SPRINGTIME FOLLOWING THE DARKNESS AND THE COLD OF THE YEAR'S NIGHT IS NEW
IN THE EARLY PART OF 1857 THE PUBLISHED LIBELS UPON THE PEOPLE RECEIVED MANY SERIOUS ADDITIONS THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH WAS PROMULGATED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESIGNATION OF JUDGE DRUMMOND OF THE UTAH FEDERAL COURT
THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH RECOGNIZING THE INEVITABLE LONG BEFORE PREDICTED BY THEIR MURDERED PROPHET THAT THE MARCH OF THE CHURCH WOULD BE WESTWARD REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE GRAND TEMPLE UPON WHICH THEY HAD NOT CEASED TO WORK THROUGH ALL THE STORMS OF PERSECUTION
SECOND REPENTANCE
AGAIN THE SKEPTIC WILL SAY THIS WAS BUT CHANCE
THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN ROUSED TO DESPERATION AND FORCE WAS TO BE MET WITH FORCE
WE BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST PRINCIPLES AND ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL ARE
TO THIS EFFECT WAS THE DECISION:--WE HAVE BUILT CITIES IN THE EAST FOR OUR FOES TO OCCUPY
AND EVEN IN SUCH CASES THEIR REVERENCE FOR THE SACRED LETTER RENDERS THEM EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THE MAJORITY OF BIBLE COMMENTATORS AND CRITICS IN PLACING FREE CONSTRUCTION UPON THE TEXT
AND WAS DOUBTLESS SUGGESTED BY THE TITLE OF A PROMINENT PUBLICATION GIVEN TO THE WORLD THROUGH JOSEPH SMITH IN AN EARLY PERIOD OF THE CHURCH'S HISTORY
HERE AGAIN THE INHERENT JUSTICE OF MORMON PHILOSOPHY SHOWS ITSELF IN THE DOCTRINE OF SALVATION FOR THE DEAD
ATTRACTED BY A FAINT LIGHT NEAR THE BANK HE APPROACHED THE SPOT THERE TO FIND A FEW HAGGARD FACES SURROUNDING ONE WHO SEEMED TO BE IN THE LAST STAGES OF FEVER
CERTAIN MORMON BUSINESS AGENTS OPERATING IN MISSOURI HEARD OF THE HOSTILE MOVEMENT
IT DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN MORALITY AND RELIGION
AND SURELY SUCH CONJECTURES WERE PARDONABLE ON THE PART OF ALL WHOSE IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICE STILL NURSED THE DELUSION OF MORMON DISLOYALTY
OBERLIN COLLEGE OHIO OCTOBER 17 1895
HIS PRESENCE AND PERSONALITY HAD BEEN EVER POWERFUL AS A STIMULUS TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE
A PIONEER PARTY CONSISTING OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY AND FOUR PRECEDED THE MAIN BODY
WE BELIEVE THAT A MAN MUST BE CALLED OF GOD BY PROPHECY AND BY THE LAYING ON OF HANDS BY THOSE WHO ARE IN AUTHORITY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND ADMINISTER IN THE ORDINANCES THEREOF
THEREFORE MEMBERSHIP IN THE CHURCH WHICH IF OF ANY VALUE AND SIGNIFICANCE AT ALL IS OF MORE THAN TEMPORAL MEANING MUST BE GOVERNED BY LAWS WHICH ARE PRESCRIBED BY THE POWERS OF HEAVEN
TOOLS LAY AS LAST USED
AND ABOUT THE SAME TIME MEN WHO HAD COME FROM UTAH TO NEW YORK DIRECT PUBLISHED OVER THEIR OWN SIGNATURES A DECLARATION THAT ALL WAS PEACEFUL IN AND ABOUT THE SETTLEMENTS OF UTAH
BUT IT MAY BE ASKED WHAT NECESSITY WAS THERE FOR A RESTORATION IF THE PRIESTHOOD HAD BEEN ONCE ESTABLISHED UPON EARTH
HAS THE STATE EVER REMUNERATED EVEN THOSE KNOWN TO BE INNOCENT FOR THE LOSS OF EITHER THEIR PROPERTY OR THEIR ARMS
THEN THERE IS THE TERRESTRIAL STATE COMPARABLE TO THE FIRST AS IS THE MOON TO THE SUN
GOD HIMSELF TREATS AS SACRED AND THEREFORE AS INVIOLABLE THE FREEDOM OF THE HUMAN SOUL
WHEN BRIGHAM YOUNG PASSED FROM EARTH HE WAS MOURNED OF THE PEOPLE AS DEEPLY AS WAS MOSES OF ISRAEL
PUBLISHED BY THE DESERET NEWS SALT LAKE CITY UTAH
AMONGST THE EFFECTS OF THE MORMON PARTY WAS A LEATHERN BOAT WHICH ON WATER SERVED THE LEGITIMATE PURPOSE OF ITS MAKER AND ON LAND WAS MADE TO DO SERVICE AS A WAGON BOX
WIVES IN THE PANGS OF MATERNITY USHERING INTO THE WORLD INNOCENT BABES DOOMED TO BE MOTHERLESS FROM THEIR BIRTH
AT THAT TIME THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AND PROBABLY WERE MANY TIMES THAT NUMBER WHO HAD PROFESSED ADHERENCE TO THE NEWLY RESTORED FAITH
THE PEOPLE SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO WITHSTAND THE ASSAULT OF THIS NEW FOE
MORMONISM AFFIRMS THAT ALL WISDOM IS OF GOD THAT THE HALO OF HIS GLORY IS INTELLIGENCE AND THAT MAN HAS NOT YET LEARNED ALL THERE IS TO LEARN OF HIM AND HIS WAYS

FOOTNOTE 3
THAT IN THE PRIMEVAL WORLD THERE WERE SPIRITS NOBLE AND GREAT AS THERE WERE OTHERS OF LESSER POWER AND INFERIOR PURPOSE
FOR SAID HE THAT DAY SHALL NOT COME EXCEPT THERE COME A FALLING AWAY FIRST II THESS
IT ASSERTS THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVIOLABLE LAW OF ORGANIC NATURE--THAT LIKE SHALL BEGET LIKE AND THAT MULTIPLICATION OF NUMBERS AND PERPETUATION OF SPECIES SHALL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONDITION EACH AFTER HIS KIND THE CHILD MAY ACHIEVE THE FORMER STATUS OF THE PARENT AND THAT IN HIS MORTAL CONDITION MAN IS A GOD IN EMBRYO
BUT DIVINE BLESSINGS ARE NOT TO BE RECKONED IN TERMS OF EARTHLY POSSESSIONS OR BODILY EXCELLENCIES ALONE
FOR THIS ETERNAL TRUTH IS GIVEN THAT GOD WILL FORCE NO MAN TO HEAVEN
ON THEIR ARRIVAL THE GENTLEMEN WERE MET BY THE RETIRING OFFICIALS AND WERE PEACEABLY INSTALLED
AND PAUL ADDS THERE ARE ALSO CELESTIAL BODIES AND BODIES TERRESTRIAL
IT HOLDS THAT IT IS NO MORE NEARLY POSSIBLE NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF THE ANCIENT PROPHETS OR IN THE APOSTOLIC AGE FOR THE CHURCH OF CHRIST TO EXIST WITHOUT DIRECT AND CONTINUOUS REVELATION FROM GOD
IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT SOME FUTURE TEXT BOOK FOR THE USE OF GENERATIONS YET UNBORN WILL CONTAIN A QUESTION SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NOT A HAND TO GATHER OR SAVE
ALREADY THE CONFLICT HAD BEGUN AND A PICKED PART OF THE ARMY WAS AWAY IN THE WESTERN WILDS DOING NOTHING FOR ANY PHASE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD
HE SAW A MULTITUDE OF TOWNS AND CITIES HAMLETS AND VILLAS FILLING THIS AND NEIGHBORING VALLEYS WITH THE FAIREST OF ALL A CITY WHOSE BEAUTY OF SITUATION WHOSE WEALTH OF RESOURCE SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD RISING FROM THE MOST ARID SITE OF THE BURNING DESERT BEFORE HIM HARD BY THE BARREN SALT SHORES OF THE WATERY WASTE
WOMEN WITH BABES IN THEIR ARMS WERE FORCED TO FLEE HALF-CLAD INTO THE SOLITUDE OF THE PRAIRIE TO ESCAPE FROM MOBOCRATIC VIOLENCE
THE MANUSCRIPT WAS DEPOSITED IN THE LIBRARY OF OBERLIN COLLEGE WHERE IT NOW REPOSES
WITH THIS AS THE TRUE MOTIVE MANY PRETEXTS FOR ANNOYANCE WERE FOUND
THE SETTLERS BY THE LAKE NEEDED HORSES AND WAGONS TOOLS IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY AND BUILDING
DURING THE THOUSAND YEARS COVERED BY THE NEPHITE RECORD THE PEOPLE CROSSED THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA WHICH IS GRAPHICALLY DESCRIBED AS A NECK OF LAND BUT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM SEA TO SEA AND SUCCESSIVELY OCCUPIED EXTENSIVE TRACTS IN WHAT IS NOW MEXICO THE VALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE EASTERN STATES
IT WAS DECIDED HOWEVER THAT THE SOLDIERS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO MARCH THROUGH THE CITY AND STRAIGHTWAY THE MORMONS BEGAN THEIR EXODUS TO THE SOUTH
THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED OUT AND THE MORMONS WERE DISARMED
AND RIGHT WELL DO THEY FEEL THEIR WELCOME FOR THEY ARE HABITUALLY SO TAME AND FEARLESS THAT THEY MAY ALMOST BE TOUCHED BY THE HAND BEFORE THEY TAKE FLIGHT
THE PEOPLE ASKED WHAT THEY HAD DONE THAT NEEDED PARDON
INDEED ONE ENTIRE TOWN THAT OF MORLEY WAS BY SUCH INCENDIARISM REDUCED TO ASHES
MORMONISM CLAIMS THAT SCRIPTURES DECLARING THE ONENESS OF THE TRINITY ADMIT OF THIS INTERPRETATION
THE PUBLIC EYE BEGAN TO TWITCH AND SOON TO OPEN WIDE
IT HOLDS THAT THE HONEST THOUGH PERCHANCE MISTAKEN SOUL WHO LIVED OR TRIED TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE LIGHT HE HAD RECEIVED SHALL BE COUNTED AMONG THE HONORABLE OF THE EARTH AND SHALL FIND OPPORTUNITY IF NOT HERE THEN IN THE HEREAFTER FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS ESSENTIAL FOR SALVATION
THAT CHRIST WILL REIGN PERSONALLY UPON THE EARTH AND THAT THE EARTH WILL BE RENEWED AND RECEIVE ITS PARADISIACAL GLORY
A HISTORICAL WRITER OF THE TIME JOSIAH QUINCY A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE MARTYRDOM WROTE
STATE OFFICIALS INCLUDING EVEN THE GOVERNOR GAVE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR SYMPATHY AND GOOD FEELING
WHAT THE HEART OF MAN CAN CONCEIVE THE HAND OF MAN WILL FIND A WAY TO EXECUTE
IT EMBRACES A BOUNDLESS LIBERALITY OF BELIEF AND PRACTISE
IF ANY OF YOU LACK WISDOM LET HIM ASK OF GOD THAT GIVETH TO ALL MEN LIBERALLY AND UPBRAIDETH NOT
IT WAS HERE THAT A MEMORIAL WAS PREPARED AND SENT TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT RECITING THE OUTRAGES OF MISSOURI AND ASKING REPARATION
BEN CROWDER <CROWDERB@BLANKSLATE.NET> HTTP://WWW.BLANKSLATE.NET/LANG/ETEXTS.PHP THIS ETEXT WAS ORIGINALLY TRANSCRIBED INTO PALM FORMAT BY RICK OWEN <RICKOWEN@YAHOO.COM> REFORMATTED FOR PROJECT GUTENBERG BY BEN CROWDER <CROWDERB@BLANKSLATE.NET> THE STORY OF MORMONISM AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM BY JAMES E
THIS IS THE VERY PLACE OF WHICH BRIDGER SPAKE WHEN HE PROFFERED A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD FOR THE FIRST BUSHEL OF GRAIN THAT COULD BE RAISED HERE
THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS WERE LONG REGARDED AS A POLYGAMOUS PEOPLE
THAT PLURAL MARRIAGE HAS BEEN PRACTISED BY A LIMITED PROPORTION OF THE PEOPLE UNDER SANCTION OF CHURCH ORDINANCE HAS NEVER SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM BEEN DENIED
GENERAL TAYLOR'S VICTORIES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE STRIFE HAD BEEN ALL BUT DECISIVE BUT THE REPUBLIC WAS ON MARCH TO THE WESTERN OCEAN AND THE PROVINCES OF NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA WERE IN HER PATH
THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN--NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
AMONG THE MANY FALSE THEORIES PROPOUNDED PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE SO-CALLED SPAULDING STORY
BUT MORMONISM IS BOLDER YET
IT WAS SITUATED BUT A FEW MILES FROM QUINCY IN A BEND OF THE MAJESTIC RIVER GIVING THE TOWN THREE WATER FRONTS
SURELY THOUGHT HE THESE SEVERAL CHURCHES OPPOSED AS THEY ARE TO ONE ANOTHER ON WHAT APPEAR TO BE THE VITAL POINTS OF RELIGION CANNOT ALL BE RIGHT
THE AWFUL QUIET COMPELLED HIM TO TREAD A-TIP-TOE AS IF THREADING THE AISLES OF AN UNOCCUPIED CATHEDRAL
JOSEPH FURTHER TESTIFIES THAT HE WAS TOLD THAT IF HE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO HIS TRUST AND THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM HE WOULD SOME DAY RECEIVE THE RECORD INTO HIS KEEPING AND BE COMMISSIONED AND EMPOWERED TO TRANSLATE IT
LET IT NOT BE FORGOTTEN HOWEVER THAT TOLERATION IS NOT ACCEPTANCE
THE THOUGHT THAT PLURAL MARRIAGE HAS EVER BEEN THE HEAD AND FRONT OF MORMON OFFENDING THAT TO IT IS TRACEABLE AS THE TRUE CAUSE THE HATRED OF OTHER SECTS AND THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE CHURCH IS NOT TENABLE TO THE EARNEST THINKER
THIS GREAT APOSTASY WAS FORETOLD
AND THAT THESE MAY BE DEVELOPED SO AS TO MAKE HIM EVEN WHILE MORTAL IN A MEASURE GODLIKE
THE GOSPEL PLAN AS ACCEPTED AND TAUGHT BY THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS IS STRIKINGLY SIMPLE
THE GOVERNMENT OF IOWA HAD COURTEOUSLY ASSURED THEM PROTECTION WHILE PASSING THROUGH THAT TERRITORY
AND JOSEPH APPEARING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS IN THE SECOND STORY RECEIVED THE LEADEN MISSILES OF THE BESIEGING MOB WHICH WAS LED BY A RECREANT THOUGH PROFESSED MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THIS CAMP OF MISERY HE HEARD THE SOBBINGS OF CHILDREN HUNGRY AND SICK
NO UNWARRANTED GLORIFICATION OF MERCY TO THE DEGRADING OR NEGLECT OF JUSTICE
A SUPREME OPPORTUNITY HAD COME AND HOW WAS IT USED
AT SHORT INTERVALS IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT-PASSAGE THROUGH THE CANYON THE PARTY WAS CHALLENGED AND THE PASSWORD DEMANDED
OFF TO THE WESTWARD LAY THE LAKE MAKING AN IMPRESSIVE UNINVITING PICTURE IN ITS SEVERE UNLIVING BEAUTY
ONE OF THE CIRCUIT JUDGES WHO WAS ASKED TO ISSUE A PEACE WARRANT REFUSED TO DO SO BUT ADVISED THE MORMONS TO ARM THEMSELVES AND MEET THE FORCE OF THE OUTLAWS WITH ORGANIZED RESISTANCE
SOON THE SOIL OF ILLINOIS WAS FREE FROM MORMON TREAD
AND IN OTHER WAYS TO DISPOSE OF THE REGULAR ARMY IN THE MANNER BEST CALCULATED TO FAVOR THE ANTICIPATED REBELLION ARE MATTERS OF HISTORY
IN THEIR SLOW MARCH THEY HAD BEEN PASSED BY A NUMBER OF WELL-EQUIPPED PARTIES SOME OF THEM FROM MISSOURI BOUND FOR THE PACIFIC
IT CONTEMPLATES A MILLENNIUM OF PEACE WHEN EVERY MAN SHALL LOVE HIS NEIGHBOR AND RESPECT HIS NEIGHBOR'S OPINION AS HE REGARDS HIMSELF AND HIS OWN--A DAY WHEN THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE SHALL BE IN UNISON WITH THE VOICE OF GOD
HOMES WERE DESTROYED MEN TORN FROM THEIR FAMILIES WERE BRUTALLY BEATEN TARRED AND FEATHERED
5:48 BUT IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT IN HIS PRESENT STATE MAN IS FAR FROM THE CONDITION OF EVEN A RELATIVELY PERFECT BEING
THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY WAS NOT ARRESTED
THE STORY HAS BEEN TRANSLATED AND PUBLISHED ABROAD
IN THE GREAT FUTURE THERE SHALL BE FOUND A PLACE FOR EVERY SOUL WHATEVER HIS GRADE OF SPIRITUAL INTELLIGENCE MAY BE
PROPPING THE BODY AGAINST A WELL-CURB IN THE JAIL-YARD THE MURDERERS POURED A VOLLEY OF BULLETS INTO THE CORPSE AND FLED
AS TO THE FIDELITY WITH WHICH THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS HAVE SOUGHT TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES THUS DIVINELY REQUIRED AT THEIR HANDS LET THE TEMPLES ERECTED IN POVERTY AS IN RELATIVE PROSPERITY--BY THE BLOOD AND TEARS OF THE PEOPLE--TESTIFY
IT IS THEREFORE PRODUCTIVE OF MORE AND GREATER THINGS AS THE YEARS LINK THEMSELVES INTO THE CENTURIES
THE LANGUAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THE EXECUTIVE OF A SOVEREIGN STATE OF THE UNION DECLARED THAT THE MORMONS MUST BE DRIVEN FROM THE STATE OR EXTERMINATED
NOT FOR A MOMENT DID HE DOUBT THE FUTURE
IT DECLARES UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY JESUS CHRIST NO SOUL CAN BE SAVED FROM THE FATE OF THE CONDEMNED
THE MANUSCRIPT STORY HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN FULL AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE SAME AND THE BOOK OF MORMON MAY BE MADE BY ANYONE WHO HAS A MIND TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT.[1 FOOTNOTE 1
AS CARPENTER FARMER PIONEER CAPITALIST FINANCIER PREACHER APOSTLE PROPHET--IN EVERYTHING HE WAS A LEADER AMONG MEN
IN COOKE'S OWN WORDS WE READ THAT FOR THIRTY MILES THE ROAD WAS BLOCKED WITH CARCASSES--AND WITH ABANDONED AND SHATTERED PROPERTY THEY MARK PERHAPS BEYOND EXAMPLE IN HISTORY THE STEPS OF AN ADVANCING ARMY WITH THE HORRORS OF A DISASTROUS RETREAT WITH THE ARMY TRAVELED THE NEW FEDERAL APPOINTEES TO OFFICES IN THE TERRITORY
THERE WERE ORCHARDS DROPPING THEIR RICH AND ROSY FRUIT TO SPOIL BENEATH
WITHOUT DISTINCTION AS TO FORMER STATION THEY WENT OUT AND DUG THE ROOTS OF WEEDS GATHERED THE TENDEREST OF THE COARSE GRASS THISTLES AND WILD BERRIES AND THUS DID THEY SUBSIST
IT HAD BEEN THE BOAST OF ANTI-"MORMONS THAT WITH JOSEPH SMITH REMOVED THE CHURCH WOULD CRUMBLE TO PIECES OF ITSELF
IT WAS NO GREEN-HOUSE GROWTH STRUGGLING FOR EXISTENCE IN A FOREIGN CLIME BUT A FIT PLANT FOR THE SOIL OF A FREE LAND
UNTO SUCH HE TAUGHT HIS APOSTLES TO LOOK FOR SAFE GUIDANCE WHEN HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THEM
IT MAKES LOVE FOR MANKIND SECOND ONLY TO LOVE FOR DEITY
THEY GAVE THEIR REPORT;--AN ARMED FORCE OF THOUSANDS WAS AT THAT HOUR APPROACHING THE TERRITORY
AT FIRST THEY WERE INCREDULOUS BUT WHEN THE OVERLAND MAIL CARRIER FROM THE WEST DELIVERED HIS POUCH AND OBTAINED HIS RECEIPT BUT WAS REFUSED THE BAG OF UTAH MAIL WITH THE POSTMASTER'S STATEMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN ORDERED TO HOLD ALL MAIL FOR UTAH THERE SEEMED NO ROOM FOR DOUBT
BUT GENERAL JOHNSTON AND HIS STAFF HAD MORE THAN THEIR MATCH IN BATTLING WITH THE ELEMENTS
BUT THE PEOPLE ACCEPTED THAT CHANCE AS A PROVIDENTIAL RULING IN THEIR BEHALF AND REVERENTLY DID THEY GIVE THANKS
TO MOST OF THE DECLARATIONS IN THE ARTICLES OF FAITH MANY SECTS PROFESSING CHRISTIANITY COULD CONFIDENTLY PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE
COUNTY AND STATE JUDGES THE GOVERNOR AND EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WERE APPEALED TO IN TURN FOR REDRESS
THIS SO-CALLED NEW MODERN GOSPEL IS IN FACT THE OLD ONE THE FIRST ONE COME AGAIN
SUCH WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH SOON TO BE SO UNIVERSALLY MALIGNED
AND THIS MAN OF HIMSELF CANNOT CONCEIVE
THE GOVERNORS OF BOTH IOWA AND OHIO TESTIFIED TO THE WORTHINESS OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS AS CITIZENS AND PLEDGED THEM THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON
THE MANUSCRIPT HAS UPON IT THE SIGNATURES OF SEVERAL MEN OF CONNEAUGHT OHIO WHO HAD HEARD SPAULDING READ IT AND KNEW IT TO BE HIS
THERE IS NO PECULIARLY MORMON INTERPRETATION IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH THESE PRINCIPLES OF FAITH AND PRACTISE ARE VIEWED BY THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS EXCEPT IN A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY AND LITERALNESS OF ACCEPTANCE--GROSS LITERALNESS UNREFINED MATERIALISM IT HAS BEEN CALLED BY SOME CRITICAL OPPONENTS
THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE BOOK OF MORMON?"--A VERY PERTINENT ONE ON THE PART OF EVERY EARNEST STUDENT AND INVESTIGATOR OF THIS PHASE OF AMERICAN HISTORY--HAS BEEN PARTLY ANSWERED ALREADY
ON THE 6TH OF APRIL 1830 THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
THE VERY PLACE SAID BRIGHAM YOUNG AND IN HIS PROPHETIC MIND THERE ROSE A VISION OF WHAT WAS TO COME
ONE IN THEIR DIVINE OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPOTENCE
WE ALSO BELIEVE THE BOOK OF MORMON TO BE THE WORD OF GOD
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN GOVERNOR YOUNG AND THE COMMANDANT WERE FREQUENT
CHRIST HAS BEEN ORDAINED TO BE JUDGE OF BOTH QUICK AND DEAD
BUT WHAT OF THE INTERNAL WORK OF THE CHURCH DURING THESE TRYING PERIODS
THE SONG OF THE HEROISM AND SACRIFICE DISPLAYED BY THESE PILGRIMS FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE IS AWAITING A SINGER WORTHY THE THEME
THIS STRUCTURE SOLEMNLY DEDICATED TO THEIR GOD THEY ENTERED AND THERE RECEIVED THEIR ANOINTINGS AND THEIR BLESSINGS
POTATOES AND OTHER SEED WERE PUT IN AND THE LAND WAS AGAIN FLOODED
HEREABOUT HOUSES HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED
THE LAST COMPLETED WHICH WAS THE FIRST BEGUN IS SITUATED IN SALT LAKE CITY AND IS ONE OF THE WONDERS AND BEAUTIES OF THAT CITY BY THE GREAT SALT SEA.[2 FOOTNOTE 2
AND THAT THE HUMAN FAMILY WAS IN VERY TRUTH OF DIVINE ORIGIN
THIS TO THEM ESTABLISHES AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EVENTS OF THEIR OWN HISTORY AND THE PROPHECIES OF ANCIENT TIMES
11
THEY HAVE BUT TOO WELL PUT IN EXECUTION THEIR THREATS OF EXTERMINATION AND EXPULSION AND FULLY WREAKED THEIR VENGEANCE ON A BODY OF INDUSTRIOUS AND ENTERPRISING MEN WHO HAD NEVER WRONGED NOR WISHED TO WRONG THEM BUT ON THE CONTRARY HAD EVER COMPORTED THEMSELVES AS GOOD AND HONEST CITIZENS LIVING UNDER THE SAME LAWS AND HAVING THE SAME RIGHT WITH THEMSELVES TO THE SACRED IMMUNITIES OF LIFE LIBERTY AND PROPERTY
BUT THE MANUSCRIPT STORY WAS LOST FOR A TIME AND IN THE ABSENCE OF PROOF TO THE CONTRARY REPORTS OF THE PARALLELISM BETWEEN THE TWO WORKS MULTIPLIED
WE HAVE WITNESSED OUTRAGES BEYOND DESCRIPTION
BUT THAT INDIVIDUAL SALVATION OR RESCUE FROM THE EFFECTS OF PERSONAL SINS IS TO BE ACQUIRED BY EACH FOR HIMSELF BY FAITH AND GOOD WORKS THROUGH THE REDEMPTION WROUGHT BY JESUS CHRIST
THE HOUSEHOLD BECAME SOMEWHAT DIVIDED ON THE SUBJECT OF RELIGION AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES WITH THE MORE POPULAR SECTS
DID THEY EVER AS A BODY REFUSE OBEDIENCE TO THE LAWS WHEN CALLED UPON TO DO SO UNTIL DRIVEN TO DESPERATION BY REPEATED THREATS AND ASSAULTS BY THE MOB
SOME OF THEM WERE HONORABLE AND UPRIGHT MEN AND AMONGST THIS CLASS THE MORMON PEOPLE RECKON A NUMBER WHO WHILE OPPOSED TO THEIR RELIGIOUS TENETS WERE NEVERTHELESS SINCERE AND HONEST IN THE OPPOSITION THEY EVINCED
IT WILL BE SEEN THEN THAT MORMONISM OFFERS NO MODIFIED OR CONDITIONAL CLAIMS AS TO THE NECESSITY OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND ORDINANCES OF THE GOSPEL BY EVERY RESPONSIBLE INHABITANT OF EARTH UNTO WHOM SALVATION SHALL COME
POINTING TO THE OTHER ONE SAID THIS IS MY BELOVED SON HEAR HIM IN ANSWER TO THE LAD'S PRAYER THE HEAVENLY PERSONAGE SO DESIGNATED INFORMED JOSEPH THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD DWELT NOT WITH WARRING SECTS WHICH WHILE PROFESSING A FORM OF GODLINESS DENIED THE POWER THEREOF AND THAT HE SHOULD JOIN NONE OF THEM
AND THE LAND OF MORMONDOM WAS NO LONGER ISOLATED
AND PROMINENT AMONG THEM WAS JOHN FLOYD SECRETARY OF WAR
JOSEPH SMITH THE YOUTHFUL PROPHET AND REVELATOR OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY KNEW THAT THE ETERNAL FATHER AND THE WELL-BELOVED SON JESUS CHRIST WERE IN FORM AND STATURE LIKE UNTO PERFECT MEN
THIS STRUCTURE WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE BUT THE TEMPLE-BUILDING SPIRIT WAS NOT TO BE QUENCHED AND IN THE VALES OF UTAH TODAY ARE FOUR MAGNIFICENT TEMPLE EDIFICES
THE WOMEN HAD TO ASSIST IN DRIVING TEAMS AND STOCK AND IN OTHER LABORS OF THE JOURNEY
NOR EVEN BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
THE CHURCH CIRCULATED THE WORK AS FREELY AS POSSIBLE
13
THE EFFECT OF THIS MAN'S WONDERFUL PERSONALITY HIS SURPRISING NATURAL ABILITY AND TO THE PEOPLE THE PROOFS OF HIS DIVINE ACCEPTANCE WERE APPARENT FROM THE FIRST
A PEACE COMMISSIONER IN THE PERSON OF COLONEL KANE WAS DISPATCHED TO SALT LAKE CITY
THE BAPTISMAL FONT HAD BEEN SO DILIGENTLY DESECRATED AS TO RENDER THE APARTMENT IN WHICH IT WAS CONTAINED TOO NOISOME TO ABIDE IN THERE IN THE STEEPLE CLOSE BY THE SCAR OF DIVINE WRATH LEFT BY A RECENT THUNDERBOLT WERE BROKEN COVERS OF LIQUOR AND DRINKING VESSELS
A FEW OF THE CHARACTERISTICALLY MORMON TENETS MAY PERHAPS BE PROFITABLY CONSIDERED
A LETTER OF MORE RECENT DATE WRITTEN BY THAT HONORABLE GENTLEMAN IN REPLY TO AN INQUIRING CORRESPONDENT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE MILLENNIAL STAR LIVERPOOL NOVEMBER 3 1898 AND IS AS FOLLOWS
OF HER REPEATED APPEALS FOR THE RECOGNITION TO WHICH SHE HAD SO LONG BEEN ENTITLED IN THE SISTERHOOD OF STATES
THE SCENE OF THIS ORGANIZATION WAS FAYETTE NEW YORK AND BUT SIX PERSONS WERE DIRECTLY CONCERNED AS PARTICIPANTS
AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN HIM IN COMMON WITH SO MANY OTHERS THE EARNEST YOUTH FOUND HERE WITHIN THE SCRIPTURES ADMONITION AND COUNSEL AS DIRECTLY APPLICABLE TO HIS CASE AND CIRCUMSTANCES AS IF THE LINES HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM BY NAME
UNDER THE SPELL OF UNRIGHTEOUS ZEAL THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY OF UTAH ANNOUNCED AND PRACTISED THAT MOST INFAMOUS DOCTRINE OF SEGREGATION OF OFFENSES WITH ACCUMULATING PENALTIES
THAT THERE ARE INFINITE GRADATIONS BEYOND THE GRAVE AS THERE ARE HERE AND AS THERE WERE IN THE STATE PRECEDING THIS
THERE I FIND THIS MEASURE OF JUST EQUALITY OF THE SEXES THAT THE SINS OF MAN SHALL NOT BE VISITED UPON THE HEAD OF WOMAN
ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF--WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
IN THE ACCEPTANCE OF SACRED WRIT AS THE WORD OF GOD
ALL WHO ARE ENTITLED TO THE PRIVILEGES OF MORTALITY AND HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THIS SPHERE SHALL COME AT THE TIME APPOINTED AND SHALL RETURN TO INHERIT EACH THE GLORY OR THE DEGRADATION TO WHICH HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF ADAPTED
IS IT UNREASONABLE IS IT UNPHILOSOPHICAL THUS TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE
THAT THE CLAIM IS A BOLD ONE IS CONCEDED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
9
AS TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS IN WHICH THE RECORD WAS ENGRAVED COPIES WERE SHOWN TO LEARNED LINGUISTS OF THE DAY AND PRONOUNCED BY THEM AS CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE REFORMED EGYPTIAN WRITING
WE SAY WE KNOW OF NO LANGUAGE SUFFICIENTLY STRONG FOR THE EXPRESSION OF OUR SHAME AND ABHORRENCE OF HER RECENT CONDUCT
TO THEM IT IS THE RESULT OF CAUSES UNNUMBERED THAT HAVE OPERATED THROUGH AGES OF HUMAN HISTORY AND THEY SEE IN IT THE CAUSE OF MANY DEVELOPMENTS YET TO APPEAR
AND AT INTERVALS TO THE EARS OF THOSE OUTCASTS THE SICK AND THE DYING THE WIND BROUGHT THE SOUL-PIERCING SOUNDS OF THE REVELING MOB IN THE DISTANT CITY THE SCRAP OF VULGAR SONG THE SHOCKING OATH SHRIEKED FROM THE TEMPLE TOWER IN THE MADNESS OF DRUNKEN ORGIES
AND MOREOVER WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL AS OF EVERY SECT OR OTHER ORGANIZATION OF INDIVIDUALS TO BELIEVE AND PRACTISE ACCORDING TO CHOICE IN MATTERS RELIGIOUS IT AFFIRMS THAT IT IS THE ONLY CHURCH ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH POSSESSING THIS AUTHORITY AND PRIESTHOOD
BUT THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE OF ALL WAS THAT THE PEOPLE HAD DESTROYED THE RECORDS OF THE COURT AND THAT THEY HAD RESENTED WITH HOSTILE DEMONSTRATION HIS PROTESTS
AND HOLDS THAT EACH SHALL BE REWARDED FOR THE MEASURE OF GOOD HE HAS WROUGHT TO BE ADJUDGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE HE HAS GAINED
THERE IS NO CLAIM OF UNIVERSAL FORGIVENESS
BUT A SECOND TEMPLE LARGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE FIRST SOON REARED ITS SPIRES IN THE CITY OF NAUVOO ILLINOIS
THE CHURCH ASSERTS THAT THE WISDOM OF HUMAN LEARNING WHILE RANKING AMONG THE CHOICEST OF EARTHLY POSSESSIONS IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOSPEL
A BARREN ARID PLAIN RIMMED BY MOUNTAINS LIKE A LITERAL BASIN STILL OCCUPIED IN ITS LOWEST PARTS BY THE DREGS OF WHAT HAD ONCE FILLED IT TO THE BRIM
RECENT FOOTPRINTS WERE STILL DISTINCT IN THE DUSTY THOROUGHFARES
WHAT BECAME OF HIM AT ONE TIME SO POPULAR THAT HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS A LIKELY SUCCESSOR TO WINFIELD SCOTT IN THE OFFICE OF GENERAL-IN-CHIEF OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
THE DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT DISORGANIZED THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH
FROM ITS BLUE WASTES SOMBER PEAKS ROSE AS PRECIPITOUS ISLANDS AND ABOUT THE SHORES OF THIS DEAD SEA WERE SALINE FLATS THAT TOLD OF THE SCORCHING HEAT AND THIRSTY ATMOSPHERE OF THIS PARCHED REGION
NO GREEN MEADOWS NOT A TREE WORTHY THE NAME SCARCE A PATCH OF GREENSWARD TO ENTICE THE ADVENTUROUS WANDERERS INTO THE VALLEY
WE HOLD THE DOCTRINE TO BE REASONABLE SCRIPTURAL AND TRUE THAT MORTAL BIRTH IS NO MORE THE BEGINNING OF THE SOUL'S EXISTENCE THAN IS DEATH ITS END
IT HOLDS AS ABSOLUTELY INDISPENSABLE TO PROPER CHURCH ORGANIZATION THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING ORACLES OF GOD WHO SHALL BE DIRECTED FROM THE HEAVENS IN THEIR EARTHLY MINISTRY
AND THERE COUNTING WELL THE COST OF PROCEEDING FARTHER WENT INTO CAMP AT FORT BRIDGER
THIS NECESSITATES THE EXISTENCE AND AUTHORIZED MINISTRATIONS OF PROPHETS APOSTLES HIGH PRIESTS SEVENTIES ELDERS BISHOPS PRIESTS TEACHERS AND DEACONS NOW AS ANCIENTLY--NOT MEN SELECTED BY MEN WITHOUT AUTHORITY CLOTHED BY HUMAN CEREMONIAL ALONE NOR MEN WITH THE EMPTY NAMES OF OFFICE BUT MEN WHO BEAR THE TITLE BECAUSE THEY POSSESS THE AUTHORITY HAVING BEEN CALLED OF GOD
WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ITS DEDICATION THE TEMPLE IN KIRTLAND WAS ABANDONED BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMPELLED TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES BEFORE THE ONSLAUGHTS OF MOBOCRATS
2
AND EVEN THESE NARROW LODGINGS HAD NOT BEEN LEFT INVIOLATE
WHILE BOLDLY ASSERTING THAT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS IS THE SOLE REPOSITORY OF THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD AS NOW RESTORED TO EARTH IT TEACHES AND DEMANDS THE FULLEST TOLERATION FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS PROFESSING RIGHTEOUSNESS
WITH MAILS THREE MONTHS APART NEWS TRAVELED SLOWLY
HE SIGNED IT AS GOVERNOR OF UTAH TERRITORY THIS BUT BELITTLED HIM FOR BY THE VERY TERMS OF THE ORGANIC ACT TO UPHOLD WHICH WAS THE PROFESSED PURPOSE OF HIS COMING HE WAS NOT GOVERNOR UNTIL THE OATH OF OFFICE HAD BEEN DULY ADMINISTERED AND SUBSCRIBED
THE BOASTS OF OFFICERS AND MEN AS TO WHAT THEY WOULD DO WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN MORMON TOWNS WERE REPORTED
SOME OTHER EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON MUST BE FOUND IF ANY EXPLANATION IS REQUIRED
TRUE THE CHURCH IS PROGRESSIVE AS IT EVER HAS BEEN
BUT OTHER LAWS FOLLOWED MOST OF WHICH AS THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS BELIEVE WERE AIMED DIRECTLY AT THEIR RELIGIOUS CONCEPTION OF THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT AND NOT AT SOCIAL IMPROPRIETY NOR SEXUAL OFFENSE
HUSBANDMEN WERE CAPTURED IN THEIR FIELDS BEATEN TORTURED UNTIL THEY BARELY HAD STRENGTH LEFT TO PROMISE COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEMANDS OF THEIR ASSAILANTS,--THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE THE STATE
AND THE LINE OF THE MIGRATING HOSTS SOON STRETCHED FROM THE MISSOURI TO THE VALLEY OF THE GREAT SALT LAKE
MERCHANDISE BROUGHT IN BY CARAVANS OF PRAIRIE SCHOONERS WAS SOLD AS FAST AS IT COULD BE PUT OUT
AND LIKE THE PHILISTINES THE ENEMY STRUCK AT THE SUPPOSED BOND OF POWER
IF COMPLIANCE WITH THE DIVINE LAW AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAITH REPENTANCE BAPTISM AND THE BESTOWAL OF THE RIGHT TO THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SALVATION OF THOSE FEW WHO JUST NOW ARE COUNTED AMONG THE LIVING SUCH IS NOT LESS NECESSARY FOR THOSE WHO ONCE WERE LIVING BUT NOW ARE DEAD
THE WINTER WAS SEVERE
AND ARRESTS TRIALS AND ACQUITTALS WERE COMMON EXPERIENCES OF THE CHURCH OFFICERS
LYING DOWN AT NIGHT WITH A PRAYER IN THE HEART THAT THEY WAKE NO MORE ON EARTH A PRAYER WHICH HAD ITS FULFILMENT IN HUNDREDS OF CASES
AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE WERE WELL UNDER WAY A THOROUGH ORGANIZATION WAS EFFECTED
IN NAMELESS WAYS BE GOOD AND KIND BUT NEVER FORCE THE HUMAN MIND MORMONISM CONTENDS THAT NO MAN OR NATION POSSESSES THE RIGHT TO FORCIBLY DEPRIVE EVEN THE HEATHEN OF HIS RIGHT TO WORSHIP HIS DEITY
WE DO NOT WISH TO FIGHT THEREFORE WE DEPART LEAVING A FEW MEN TO APPLY THE BRAND TO THE COMBUSTIBLES STORED IN EVERY HOUSE AT THE FIRST SIGN OF PLUNDER BY THE SOLDIERS THE PEOPLE AGAIN DESERTED THEIR HOMES AND MOVED INTO THE DESERT ANEW
WE HOLD THAT MANKIND ARE LITERALLY THE SPIRITUAL CHILDREN OF GOD
WE HOLD THAT THE FATHER HAS AN INDIVIDUAL INTEREST IN HIS CHILDREN
THERE THEIR SAD CONDITION EVOKED FOR A TIME GENERAL COMMISERATION
THEY CONDUCTED HIM THROUGH THE TEMPLE
NEITHER OF JOSEPH SMITH NOR OF BRIGHAM YOUNG
BUT THE BRUTISH PASSION OF THE MOB WAS NOT YET SATED
FROM THIS LATER SCRIPTURE SEE D&C SEC
HE WAS THE SON OF INDUSTRIOUS PARENTS WHO POSSESSED STRONG RELIGIOUS TENDENCIES AND TOLERANT NATURES
CHANGES MANY AND GREAT FOLLOWED IN BEWILDERING SUCCESSION IN UTAH
AND THE MILITARY FORCE WAS CHARGED WITH THE DUTY OF INSTALLING THE FOREIGN APPOINTEES
EVEN BEFORE THIS TIME HOWEVER POPULOUS SETTLEMENTS OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS HAD BEEN MADE IN JACKSON COUNTY MISSOURI
MORMONISM AFFIRMS ITS UNQUALIFIED BELIEF IN THE GODHEAD AS THE HOLY TRINITY COMPRISING FATHER SON AND HOLY GHOST
A SYSTEM WHICH NOW AFTER MANY DECADES OF SUCCESSFUL TRIAL IS HELD UP BY THE NATION'S WISE AND GREAT ONES TO BE THE ONE PRACTICABLE METHOD OF RECLAIMING OUR COUNTRY'S VAST DOMAINS OF ARID LANDS
THEIR SYSTEM OF EQUAL RIGHTS WITH THEIR MARKED DISAPPROVAL OF EVERY SPECIES OF ARISTOCRATIC SEPARATION AND SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT WAS DECLARED TO BE A SPECIES OF COMMUNISM DANGEROUS TO THE STATE
HE IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING BEEN MORE THAN ORDINARILY STUDIOUS FOR HIS YEARS
FAIRCHILD
MOSES WAS NO MERE THEOLOGIAN TRAINED FOR HIS AUTHORITY OR ACTS ON WHAT GOD HAD SAID TO ABRAHAM TO ISAAC OR TO JACOB
ON THE 24TH OF JULY 1857 THE PEOPLE HAD ASSEMBLED IN CELEBRATION OF PIONEER DAY
TWO OF THE UTAHNS IMMEDIATELY HASTENED WESTWARD
PUBLISHED AT SALT LAKE CITY UTAH 1913 CHAPTER II BUT WE HAVE ANTICIPATED THE CURRENT OF EVENTS
IN AN EFFORT TO PRESENT IN CONCISE FORM THE CARDINAL DOCTRINES OF THIS ORGANIZATION I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN QUOTE THE SO-CALLED ARTICLES OF FAITH OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS WHICH HAVE BEEN IN PUBLISHED FORM BEFORE THE WORLD FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY.[4 FOOTNOTE 4
NO RESPECT WAS PAID TO AGE OR SEX
BOGGS ISSUED HIS INFAMOUS EXTERMINATING ORDER AND CALLED UPON THE MILITIA OF THE STATE TO EXECUTE IT
HUNDREDS OF BEEF CATTLE HAD DIED
AND STRICT RULES WERE ENFORCED ALLOWING BUT A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT TO EACH PURCHASER
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ALLEGED REVELATION FROM THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH IS SUCH AS TO DEMAND ATTENTIVE CONSIDERATION
EVERYWHERE ARE THEY TOLD TO MAINTAIN PEACE
THE FATHER AND THE SON EACH A PERSONAGE OF SPIRIT AND OF IMMORTALIZED BODY
THERE WERE FIELDS OF HEAVY GRAIN THE BOUNTEOUS HARVEST ROTTING ON THE GROUND
WHAT HISTORICAL AMERICAN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAS EXERTED THE MOST POWERFUL INFLUENCE UPON THE DESTINIES OF HIS COUNTRYMEN AND IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT INTERROGATORY MAY BE THUS WRITTEN--"JOSEPH SMITH THE MORMON PROPHET AND THE REPLY ABSURD AS IT DOUBTLESS SEEMS TO MOST MEN NOW LIVING MAY BE AN OBVIOUS COMMONPLACE TO THEIR DESCENDANTS
BUT THEY SO FAR HEEDED IT AS TO ARM A SMALL FORCE
HE IS NOT WITHOUT ADMIRERS AMONG MEN WHO DENY THE TRUTH OF HIS PRINCIPLES AND THE FAITH OF HIS PEOPLE
IT REGARDS THE STRICTEST MORALITY AS AN INDISPENSABLE FEATURE OF EVERY RELIGIOUS SYSTEM CLAIMING IN ANY DEGREE DIVINE RECOGNITION
AND THE PEOPLE ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT IS AT ITS WEAKEST STAGE FOR ALL TIME TO COME
FOLLOWING THE ADVENT OF THE TELEGRAPH CAME THE RAILWAY
AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH HIS BODY HAD LAIN IN THE TOMB GUARDED BY THE SOLDIERY HE DECLARED TO THE SORROWING MAGDALENE THAT HE HAD NOT AT THAT TIME ASCENDED TO HIS FATHER
AND WITH SUCH A PROSPECT MEN MAY BE EXPECTED TO TAKE EVERY ADVANTAGE OF THEIR SITUATION
LOOKING FROM THE WASATCH BARRIER THE COLONISTS GAZED UPON A SCENE OF ENTRANCING THOUGH FORBIDDING BEAUTY
THIS ADVICE WAS NOT PLEASING TO THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS WHOSE RELIGION ENJOINED TOLERANCE AND PEACE
BY THE AUTUMN OF 1848 FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD ALREADY REACHED THE VALLEY AND THE FOOD PROBLEM WAS A MOST DIFFICULT ONE
A CHARGE WHICH PROMISED TO PROVE AS DEVOID OF FOUNDATION AS HAD THE EXCUSES FOR THE FIFTY ARRESTS PRECEDING IT LED JOSEPH SMITH PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH AND HYRUM SMITH THE PATRIARCH TO AGAIN SURRENDER THEMSELVES TO THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW
THE NAME WAS ORIGINALLY APPLIED IN A SPIRIT OF DERISION AS A NICK-NAME IN FACT BY THE OPPONENTS OF THE CHURCH
YET AT THAT VERY HOUR ALL UNBEKNOWN TO THEMSELVES AND WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING A WORD IN DEFENSE THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF INSURRECTION AND TREASON
THERE WERE MEN AND WOMEN DYING FROM WOUNDS OR DISEASE WITHOUT A SEMBLANCE OF SHELTER OR OTHER PHYSICAL COMFORT
A LIMITED AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WAS ALLOWED TO EACH DIVISION
THUS BRIGHAM YOUNG WAS THE FIRST GOVERNOR
SUCH WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE IRRIGATION SYSTEM WHICH SOON BECAME CO-EXTENSIVE WITH THE AREA OCCUPIED BY THE MORMON SETTLERS A SYSTEM WHICH UNDER THE BLESSING OF PROVIDENCE HAS PROVED TO BE THE VERITABLE MAGIC TOUCH BY WHICH THE DESERT HAS BEEN MADE A FIELD OF RICHNESS AND A GARDEN OF BEAUTY
BUT THE CHARGE WAS SOON DISPROVED
FOR A SECOND TIME AND THRICE THEREAFTER THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS HAS BEEN DEPRIVED OF ITS PRESIDENT AND ON EACH OCCASION WERE REITERATED THE PROPHECIES OF DISRUPTION UTTERED AT THE TIME OF JOSEPH SMITH'S ASSASSINATION
THE HOUSE OF ITS PUBLISHER WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND THE PRESS AND TYPE WERE CONFISCATED AND THE EDITOR AND HIS FAMILY MALTREATED
TWO OF THESE GREAT EDIFICES WERE CONSTRUCTED BY THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS IN THE DAYS OF THEIR TRIBULATION IN TIMES OF THEIR DIREST PERSECUTION,--ONE AT KIRTLAND OHIO THE OTHER AT NAUVOO ILLINOIS
FOR THIS SERVICE THEY WERE WELL PAID IN CAMP PROVISIONS
THE TIDE OF IMMIGRATION SWELLED HER POPULATION CONTRIBUTING MUCH OF THE BEST FROM ALL THE CIVILIZED NATIONS OF THE EARTH
THE OTHER FACTION LED BY LAMAN THE ELDER AND WICKED BROTHER OF NEPHI WERE KNOWN AS LAMANITES
UPON THE MOST PREJUDICED REPORTS UTTERLY UNFOUNDED IN FACT WITH A CARELESSNESS WHICH EVEN HIS PERSONAL AND POLITICAL FRIENDS FOUND NO AMPLE MEANS OF EXPLAINING AWAY PRESIDENT BUCHANAN ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED THAT A MORMON REBELLION EXISTED AND ORDERED AN ARMY OF OVER TWO THOUSAND MEN TO PROCEED STRAIGHTWAY TO UTAH TO SUBDUE THE REBELS
HEAVENLY BEINGS MANIFESTED THEMSELVES TO HIM--TWO CLOTHED IN PURITY AND ALIKE IN FORM AND FEATURE
IT IS THE FAITH OF THIS PEOPLE THAT WHILE THE WORK OF GOD ON EARTH IS CARRIED ON BY MEN YET MORTALS ARE BUT INSTRUMENTS IN THE CREATOR'S HANDS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF DIVINE PURPOSES
THIS HOWEVER WAS BUT THE REAR REMNANT OF THE EXPATRIATED CHRISTIAN BAND
THEIR SETTLEMENTS EXTENDED INTO IOWA THEN A TERRITORY
IT WAS THE PLAN OF THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION TO OCCUPY THESE PROVINCES AT THE EARLIEST MOMENT POSSIBLE
THIS OF COURSE IS THE BOOK OF MORMON
THE CONVICTION WAS GROWING THAT SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED
FOR A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MODERN TEMPLES WITH NUMEROUS PICTORIAL VIEWS SEE THE HOUSE OF THE LORD BY THE PRESENT AUTHOR
THEN WITH PROPRIETY IT MAY BE ASKED:--WHAT SHALL BECOME OF THOSE WHO LIVED AND DIED WHILE THE PRIESTHOOD WAS NOT OPERATIVE UPON THE EARTH?--THOSE WHO HAVE WORKED OUT THEIR MORTAL PROBATION DURING THE AGES OF THE GREAT APOSTASY
THE SECOND FELL A PREY TO FLAMES ENKINDLED BY MOBOCRATIC HATE
BUT THE DOORS WERE NOT FASTENED AND HE ENTERED TO EXPLORE THERE WERE FRESH ASHES ON THE HEARTH
AND FAMINE STARK AND INEXORABLE THREW ITS DREAD SHADOW OVER THE PEOPLE
THERE WERE IN THE COMPANY NOT HALF ENOUGH DRAFT ANIMALS FOR THE ARDUOUS MARCH AND BUT AN INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ABLE-BODIED MEN TO TEND THE CAMPS
THE MOB WAS UNRESTRAINED IN ITS EAGERNESS FOR REVENGE
MORMONISM IS MORE THAN A CODE OF MORALS
INDEED THE TERMS MORMON QUESTION AND UTAH QUESTION HAVE BEEN OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY
THEY ACCEPT ITS ADMONITIONS AND ITS DOCTRINES AND ACCORD THERETO A LITERAL SIGNIFICANCE
AN ORDER FROM PRESIDENT POLK WHO HAD BEEN APPEALED TO BY COLONEL KANE GAVE THE PEOPLE PERMISSION TO REMAIN FOR A SHORT SEASON
SO ALSO IS THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD I COR
THAT THE FALL WAS FOREKNOWN OF GOD--THAT IT WAS TURNED TO GOOD EFFECT BY WHICH THE NECESSARY CONDITION OF MORTALITY SHOULD BE INAUGURATED
I PARAPHRASE A PORTION OF HIS ELOQUENT ADDRESS
BUT A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THESE TROUBLOUS EVENTS REVEALED AT LEAST ONE OVERT ACT--SOME MORMON SCOUTS HAD CHALLENGED A SUPPLY TRAIN
MORMONISM CLAIMS THAT ALL NATURE BOTH ON EARTH AND IN HEAVEN OPERATES ON A PLAN OF ADVANCEMENT
INDEED WE MAY SAY THAT WE FOLLOW THE ADMONITION OF PAUL WE BELIEVE ALL THINGS WE HOPE ALL THINGS WE HAVE ENDURED MANY THINGS AND HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ENDURE ALL THINGS
THE TOWN WAS IN A DREAM AND THE WARRIOR TROD LIGHTLY LEST HE WAKE IT IN AFFRIGHT FOR HE PLAINLY SAW THAT IT HAD NOT SLUMBERED LONG
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSIONERS BROUGHT THE OFFICIAL PARDON UNSOLICITED FOR ALL ACTS COMMITTED BY THE MORMONS IN OPPOSING THE ENTRANCE OF THE ARMY
AND THOUGH COMFORTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD GENERALLY BEEN THEIR LOT REVERSES AND LOSSES IN THE FATHER'S HOUSE HAD BROUGHT THE FAMILY TO POVERTY
AND THE REMNANTS OF MANY A COMPANY WERE SAVED FROM WHAT APPEARED TO BE CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BY THE OPPORTUNE ARRIVAL OF THESE RESCUING PARTIES
IN 1820 THERE LIVED ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THAT THE WORD OF THE CREATOR LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR OWN IMAGE AFTER OUR LIKENESS HAD A MEANING MORE THAN IN METAPHOR
IN THE OLD LEGEND A FAMISHING ARAB FINDING A WELL FILLED BAG UPON THE SAND WAS THRILLED WITH JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF DATES--HIS BREAD
THE PEOPLE CLAIM THIS NAME AS HAVING BEEN BESTOWED BY REVELATION AND THEREFORE THAT LIKE OTHER NAMES GIVEN OF GOD AS ATTESTED BY SCRIPTURAL INSTANCES IT IS AT ONCE NAME AND TITLE COMBINED
BUT THE OFFICIAL BODY NEXT IN AUTHORITY THE COUNCIL OF THE TWELVE STEPPED TO THE FRONT AND THE PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH WAS UNHINDERED
IN JESUS CHRIST AS THE SAVIOR AND REDEEMER OF MANKIND
EVERY COMPANY THUS MADE THE COURSE THE PLAINER
BUT A LONG LONG PERIOD OF PREPARATION HAD LED TO THIS PHYSICAL COMING FORTH OF THE MORMON RELIGION A PERIOD MARKED BY A MULTITUDE OF HISTORICAL EVENTS SOME OF THEM PRECEDING BY CENTURIES THE EARTHLY BEGINNING OF THIS MODERN SYSTEM OF PROPHETIC TRUST
THE LAMANITES LED A ROVING AGGRESSIVE LIFE
UTAH WAS NOT THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE AS THE NAME OF THEIR STATE
THERE SEEMED TO BE AN ENTRY IN THE BOOK OF FATE THAT EVERY POSSIBLE TEST OF HUMAN ENDURANCE AND INTEGRITY SHOULD BE APPLIED TO THIS PILGRIM BAND
THIS COMPILATION WAS NAMED ON THE PLATES THE BOOK OF MORMON WHICH NAME HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE MODERN TRANSLATION--A WORK THAT HAS ALREADY MADE ITS WAY OVER MOST OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MORMONISM WAS FIRST PRESENTED AS A LECTURE DELIVERED BY DR TALMAGE BEFORE THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF DENVER
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE REST
OF THE PROMPT REFUSALS WITH WHICH HER PLEAS WERE PERSISTENTLY MET THOUGH OTHER TERRITORIES WITH SMALLER AND MORE ILLITERATE POPULATIONS MORE RESTRICTED RESOURCES AND IN EVERY WAY WEAKER CLAIMS WERE ALLOWED TO ASSUME THE HABILIMENTS OF MATURITY WHILE UTAH LUSTY LARGE AND STRONG WAS KEPT IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR--FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS--A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
BUT WITH THE HELP OF ISRAEL'S GOD WE WILL PREVENT THEM ENRICHING THEMSELVES WITH THE SPOILS OF OUR LABORS IN THESE MOUNTAIN RETREATS
A TURBID RIVER RAN FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ATHWART THE VALLEY DIVIDING IT IN TWAIN AS A HISTORIAN OF THE DAY HAS WRITTEN AS IF THE VAST BOWL IN THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE MASTER POTTER'S FIRES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION HAD CRACKED ASUNDER SMALL STREAMS OF WATER STARTED IN RIPPLING HASTE FROM THE SNOW-CAPS OF THE MOUNTAINS TOWARD THE LAKE BUT MOST OF THEM WERE DEVOURED BY THE THIRSTY SANDS OF THE VALLEY BEFORE THEIR JOURNEY WAS HALF COMPLETED
HE HAS SHUT HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE CLOSED THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN AND HAS SUSPENDED ALL DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH THE PEOPLE OF EARTH THE PERSECUTION THUS ORIGINATING WITH THOSE WHO CALLED THEMSELVES MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY
BUT THE EXPULSION FROM JACKSON COUNTY WAS BUT A PRELUDE TO THE TRAGEDY SOON TO FOLLOW
THE CHURCH HOLDS THAT IN THE LIGHT OF REVELATION ANCIENT AND MODERN AND BY A FAIR INTERPRETATION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES THE SECOND COMING OF THE REDEEMER IS NEAR AT HAND
THIS ULTIMATUM WAS CARRIED TO THE FEDERAL CAMP
BUT WITH THE UN-AMERICAN SYSTEM OF TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT CAME TROUBLES
WITH HIS DEATH CLOSED ANOTHER EPOCH IN THE HISTORY OF HIS PEOPLE AND A SUCCESSOR AROSE ONE WHO WAS CAPABLE OF LEADING AND JUDGING UNDER THE CHANGED CONDITIONS
THE THEORY OF THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON IN THE TRADITIONAL MANUSCRIPT OF SOLOMON SPAULDING WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE RELINQUISHED
GAME HAD NOT BEEN PLENTIFUL AND THE MORMON PIONEERS WERE THREATENED WITH THE DIREST PRIVATIONS
REMEMBERING THE TOILSOME DESERT MARCH FROM EGYPT TO CANAAN THE PEOPLE ASSUMED THE NAME CAMP OF ISRAEL THE CAMP CONSISTED OF TWO MAIN DIVISIONS AND EACH WAS SUB-DIVIDED INTO COMPANIES OF HUNDREDS FIFTIES AND TENS WITH CAPTAINS TO DIRECT
MORMONISM CLAIMS THE SAME NECESSITY TO EXIST TODAY
CHAPTER II THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS AFFIRM THAT THE AUTHORITY TO ACT IN THE NAME OF GOD--THE HOLY PRIESTHOOD--HAS BEEN RESTORED TO EARTH IN THIS DISPENSATION AND AGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSPIRED PREDICTIONS OF EARLIER TIMES
AND WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS HURRIED DEPARTURE OF THE MILITARY
BIGOTED THEY MAY SEEM TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT AS THEY DO
A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE 30TH OF OCTOBER 1838 A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
LET IT DEVELOP INTO VIRILE FAITH
TWO OF THE THREE WOMEN WHO BELONGED TO THE PARTY WERE UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED
UPON SUCH DID THEY FEAST WITH THANKSGIVING UNTIL A LESS SCANTY HARVEST RELIEVED THEIR WANTS
WE CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF WORSHIPING ALMIGHTY GOD ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF OUR OWN CONSCIENCE AND ALLOW ALL MEN THE SAME PRIVILEGE LET THEM WORSHIP HOW WHERE OR WHAT THEY MAY
AND YEARS AFTER HIS DEMISE MEN WHO HAD REFUSED HIM HONOR WHILE ALIVE BROUGHT THEIR MITES AND THEIR GOLD TO ERECT A MONUMENT OF STONE AND BRONZE TO THE MEMORY OF THIS MAN WHO NEEDS IT NOT
BUT THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY KEPT THEIR WORD
WE HAVE IN OUR COLLEGE LIBRARY AN ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT OF SOLOMON SPAULDING--UNQUESTIONABLY GENUINE
ALREADY THEY HAD FLED BEFORE THE LAWLESS OPPRESSOR OVER WELL NIGH HALF A CONTINENT

THE RECORD PROVED TO BE AN ACCOUNT OF CERTAIN COLONIES OF IMMIGRANTS TO THIS HEMISPHERE FROM THE EAST WHO CAME SEVERAL CENTURIES BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA
HISTORY DEALS IN SURPRISES AND PARADOXES QUITE AS STARTLING AS THIS
THESE LATER COMPANIES NEEDED NO CHART NOR COMPASS TO GUIDE THEM OVER THE DESERT
SUCH HANDCART COMPANIES WERE ORGANIZED WITH CARE
WAGONS THERE WERE AS ALSO SOME HORSES AND MEN BUT ALL TOO FEW FOR THE JOURNEY

LATTER-DAY SAINTS AT KIRTLAND OHIO ELIJAH THE PROPHET WHO ANNOUNCED THAT THE TIME SPOKEN OF BY MALACHI HAD FULLY COME
WE HOLD THAT THERE IS A WIDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SALVATION AND EXALTATION
WE CAN NO LONGER COMMAND THE MILITIA FOR OUR OWN DEFENSE
THE MOVEMENT HAS BEEN CALLED NOT INAPTLY BUCHANAN'S BLUNDER BUT THE BEST AND WISEST MEN MAY MAKE BLUNDERS AND WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF PRESIDENT BUCHANAN'S SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS IN TAKING THIS STEP EVEN HIS ENEMIES DO NOT QUESTION HIS INTEGRITY IN THE MATTER
THESE PEOPLE HAD NOT LEFT THE COUNTRY OF THEIR BIRTH OR ADOPTION TO SEEK GOLD
THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN GOADED TO DESPERATION
AND THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE NOTABLE FOR THE SANCTITY WITH WHICH THEY INVEST THE MARITAL STATE
A DAM WAS THROWN ACROSS THE STREAM AND THE SOFTENING LIQUID WAS SPREAD UPON THE FLAT THAT HAD BEEN CHOSEN FOR THE FIRST FIELDS
SOME OF THE MORMON SETTLERS BECOMING INFECTED WITH THE MALADY HASTENED WESTWARD BUT THE COUNSEL OF THE CHURCH AUTHORITIES PREVAILED TO KEEP ALL BUT A FEW AT HOME
IF A FACT IT IS A FULL CONTRADICTION OF THE VAGUE THEORIES THAT HAD BEEN INCREASING AND ACCUMULATING FOR CENTURIES DENYING PERSONALITY AND PARTS TO DEITY
THEY MARRY NOT WITH THE SADDENING LIMITATION UNTIL DEATH DO YOU PART BUT FOR TIME AND FOR ALL ETERNITY."[3 THIS CONSTITUTES CELESTIAL MARRIAGE
WITH EFFRONTERY THAT WOULD SHOCK THE MODESTY OF A SAVAGE THE NON-"MORMON PARTY ADOPTED AND FLAGRANTLY DISPLAYED THE CARPET-BAG AS THE BADGE OF THEIR PROFESSION

THEN IN THEIR HASTY DEPARTURE THE SOLDIERS DISPOSED OF EVERYTHING OUTSIDE OF ACTUAL NECESSITIES IN THE WAY OF ACCOUTERMENT AND CAMP EQUIPAGE
MILCH CATTLE AND A VERY FEW DRAFT-ANIMALS WITH WAGONS FOR CONVEYING THE HEAVIER BAGGAGE AND TO CARRY THE SICK WERE ASSIGNED
THEN IF THE ARMY FORCED ITS WAY INTO THE VALLEYS OF UTAH ON HOSTILE PURPOSE BENT IT SHOULD FIND THE LAND AS TRULY A DESERT AS IT WAS WHEN THE PIONEERS FIRST TOOK POSSESSION
AMONG THEIR MANY OTHER PECULIARITIES THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS A TEMPLE-BUILDING PEOPLE AS HISTORY PROVES THE ISRAEL OF ANCIENT TIMES TO HAVE BEEN

IN WHAT RESPECT THEN MAY BE PROPERLY ASKED DOES MORMONISM DIFFER FROM THE FAITH AND PRACTISE OF OTHER PROFESSEDLY CHRISTIAN SYSTEMS--IN SHORT WHAT IS MORMONISM FIRST LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT THE TERM MORMON WITH ITS DERIVATIVES IS NOT THE OFFICIAL DESIGNATION OF THE CHURCH WITH WHICH IT IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED
IT DOES NOT CLAIM THAT ALL WHO HAVE FAILED TO ACCEPT AND OBEY THE GOSPEL OF ETERNAL LIFE SHALL BE ETERNALLY AND FOREVER DAMNED
NO HUMAN BEING WHO HAS ATTAINED YEARS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE FLESH MAY HOPE FOR SALVATION IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD UNTIL HE HAS RENDERED OBEDIENCE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CHRIST THE REDEEMER OF THE WORLD
AND WHILE JUSTICE SHALL DENY TO EVERY SOUL THAT HAS NOT RENDERED OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW ENTRANCE INTO THE KINGDOM OF THE BLESSED MERCY SHALL CLAIM OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL WHO HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES WILLING TO RECEIVE THE TRUTH AND OBEY ITS BEHESTS
AN INOFFENSIVE JOURNALISTIC ORGAN THE STAR PUBLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROPERLY PRESENTING THE RELIGIOUS TENETS OF THE PEOPLE WAS MADE THE PARTICULAR OBJECT OF THE MOB'S RAGE
MORMONISM CLAIMS AN ACTUAL AND LITERAL RELATIONSHIP OF PARENT AND CHILD BETWEEN THE CREATOR AND MAN--NOT IN THE FIGURATIVE SENSE IN WHICH THE ENGINE MAY BE CALLED THE CHILD OF ITS BUILDER

THE ROAD WAS PLAIN FROM THE MARKS OF FORMER CAMPS AND YET MORE SO FROM THE GRAVES OF FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES WHO HAD STARTED BEFORE ON THE ROAD TO THE EARTHLY ZION AND FOUND THAT IT LED THEM TO THE MARTYR'S ENTRANCE TO HEAVEN GRAVES THAT WERE MARKED PERHAPS BUT BY A RUDE INSCRIPTION CUT ON A POLE OR A BOARD
AND ONE KING SHALL RULE IN BOTH
BY THE VICARIOUS WORK OF THE LIVING IN THEIR BEHALF
HOWEVER EUPHONIOUS THE WORDS HOWEVER ELOQUENT THE PERIODS TO MAKE THE WRITING OF HIGHEST WORTH THERE MUST BE PRESENT THE DIVINE THOUGHT
GOLD BECAME SO PLENTIFUL AND WAS WITHAL SO WORTHLESS IN THE DESERT COLONY THAT MEN REFUSED TO TAKE IT FOR THEIR LABOR
AND THAT AUTHORITY RESTS IN THE PRIESTHOOD GIVEN OF GOD
CONTINUALLY ADVANCING NORTHWARD THESE PEOPLE IN TIME OCCUPIED THE GREATER PART OF THE VALLEYS OF THE ORINOCO THE AMAZON AND THE MAGDALENA
IT COMPRISES THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF THE REQUIRED ORDINANCES ON EARTH AND THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL TO THE DEPARTED
THE RESULT OF THE CONFERENCE WAS THAT THE MORMON LEADERS BUT REITERATED THEIR STATEMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S APPOINTEES WOULD BE GIVEN SAFE ENTRY TO THE CITY AND BE DULY INSTALLED IN THEIR OFFICES PROVIDED THEY WOULD ENTER WITHOUT THE ARMY
THE BOOK OF MORMON WAS BEFORE THE WORLD
BUT STRONGER THAN LEGAL PROSCRIPTION MORE POWERFUL THAN FEAR OF JUDICIAL PENALTIES IS THE POPULAR SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF THESE WHITE-WINGED DELIVERERS
KEPT FEW OR NO RECORDS AND SOON LOST THE ART OF HISTORY WRITING
AND WHEN THE OUTLAWS NEXT CAME UPON THEM THE PEOPLE WERE NOT ENTIRELY UNPREPARED

THEY WERE TAKEN TO CARTHAGE JOSEPH HAVING DECLARED TO FRIENDS HIS BELIEF THAT HE WAS GOING TO THE SLAUGHTER
THERE IN THE VERY HEART OF THE PARCHED WILDERNESS SHOULD STAND THE HOUSE OF THE LORD WITH OTHER TEMPLES IN VALLEYS BEYOND THE HORIZON OF HIS GAZE
THROUGHOUT THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS REGARDED BY THE PEOPLE AS LAW SPECIALLY DIRECTED TO THEM THEY ARE TOLD TO SAVE THEIR RICHES THAT THEY MAY PURCHASE THE INHERITANCE PROMISED THEM OF GOD
LET THE CONDUCT OF ITS GOVERNORS AND ATTORNEYS AND THE FATE OF THEIR FINAL PETITIONS ANSWER
NUMEROUS CHARGES TRIVIAL AND SERIOUS WERE MADE AGAINST THE LEADERS OF THE CHURCH AND THEY WERE REPEATEDLY BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS ONLY TO BE LIBERATED ON THE USUAL FINDING OF NO CAUSE FOR ACTION
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY WILL CONFIRM THIS VIEW
FOR THE BIBLICAL RECORD IS REPLETE WITH INSTANCES OF DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PROPHETS AND THEIR GOD
THIS MANUSCRIPT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL OF THE BOOK OF MORMON
AND WHO THAT HAS GAZED UPON THESE SPLENDID SHRINES WILL SAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CAN DO SO MUCH IN POVERTY AND TRIBULATION ARE INSINCERE
TODAY THE WANTON KILLING OF A GULL IN UTAH IS AN OFFENSE IN LAW
THE PRESENT IS THE FINAL DISPENSATION OF THE EARTH IN ITS PRESENT STATE
