WAS THAT HINT AT THE WATCHFUL EYES AND EARS AND THE SOFT FOOTSTEPS REALLY AN ALLUSION TO MR MEADOWCROFT'S DAUGHTER I ASKED
THIS EXTRAORDINARY PROCEEDING FORCED THE SUSPICION ON ME THAT SOMETHING HAD REALLY GONE WRONG
MISS MEADOWCROFT COULD SIT BY IMPENETRABLY CALM WHILE THE LAWYERS DISCUSSED THE TERRIBLE POSITION OF HER BROTHERS WITH THE SCAFFOLD IN VIEW AS ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE CASE LEFT BY MYSELF I BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY ABOUT NAOMI
JOHN JAGO THIS IS MY YOUNG RELATIVE BY MARRIAGE MR LEFRANK
YOU REMEMBER THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT WHEN I MET HIM ON THE GARDEN WALK JOHN JAGO YES
THEY WANT SOMEBODY HERE EXCEPT AMBROSE
LEAVING THE FARM THE SHERIFF HAD GONE STRAIGHT TO THE PRISON AND HAD PROCEEDED WITH THE GOVERNOR TO VISIT AMBROSE IN HIS CELL
THE NEXT DAY'S MAIL BROUGHT ME A LETTER ON BUSINESS
AFTER TELLING HIM I HATED HIM AND I DID HATE HIM I CRIED OVER HIS MISERY
WE ARE EARLY PEOPLE AT THE FARM MR LEFRANK
I SHALL NOT COME BACK AGAIN HE TURNED ABOUT AND LEFT US
I HAD TAKEN HIM BY SURPRISE
THERE IS NO HARM IN POOR AMBROSE THE GIRL'S INNOCENT FRANKNESS WAS REALLY IRRESISTIBLE
A CODICIL ATTACHED TO HIS WILL ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED WHAT NAOMI HAD TOLD ME OF MISS MEADOWCROFT'S INFLUENCE OVER HER FATHER AND OF THE END SHE HAD IN VIEW IN EXERCISING IT
I AM CERTAIN OF IT--SHE KEEPS MR MEADOWCROFT'S MIND BITTER TOWARD THE BOYS
I WAS NEARLY AS BAD AS THE BOYS
THERE HE WAS
MR JAGO IS OUT OF THE WAY I REPLIED
JOHN JAGO IS IN LOVE WITH YOU MAD ABOUT ME SHE REJOINED DROPPING HER VOICE TO A WHISPER
AND WE ALL ASSEMBLED AGAIN AT SUPPER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JOHN JAGO
HE WASN'T MAKING LOVE TO NAOMI IN THE GARDEN LAST NIGHT--OH DEAR NO
NAOMI DID NOT HESITATE FOR AN INSTANT
THE DECEASED DROPPED WITHOUT A CRY
THE MOONLIGHT MEETING HAD LEFT SOME UNWELCOME REMEMBRANCES IN HER MIND
HE WAS SHORT SPARE AND WIRY
PERSONS OF SENSITIVE NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT SLEEPING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A STRANGE HOUSE AND IN A BED THAT IS NEW TO THEM MUST MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO PASS A WAKEFUL NIGHT
THEY HAD MET
WE WANTED HIS ADDRESS RATHER BADLY THE SPEAKER WAS A STRANGER TO ME
AND I'M NOT ASHAMED OF IT EITHER IS THERE ANY SUCH PLACE AS A CHURCH IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD MR SILAS OF COURSE THERE IS AND DO YOU EVER GO TO IT OF COURSE I DO AT LONG INTERVALS MR SILAS EVERY SUNDAY SIR WITHOUT FAIL SOME THIRD PERSON BEHIND ME BURST OUT LAUGHING
LET ME ONLY SAY THAT NAOMI'S CONDUCT STRENGTHENED ME IN THE CONVICTION THAT SHE POSSESSED A NOBLE NATURE
THE BULLET WAS FIRED INTO THE AIR
YOU KNOW--AFTER DRESSING SILAS'S HAND--THAT JOHN JAGO IS READY WITH HIS KNIFE
WHEN YOU ARE SHOWN OVER THE FARM HERE SHE BEGAN YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS REALLY TWO FARMS IN ONE
THERE HAD BEEN NO DOUBT ABOUT HIS EYES AND HIS GAIT
THE OLD MAN HAD BECOME A CONFIRMED INVALID CONFINED BY CHRONIC RHEUMATISM TO HIS CHAIR
MR MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID CHAIR HAD BEEN WHEELED TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
ROUND THIS WERE RANGED A KNIFE TWO METAL BUTTONS AND A STICK PARTIALLY BURNED
YOU HAVE A FINE CONSTITUTION
I WISH I HAD NEVER GIVEN JOHN JAGO THAT MEETING SHE SAID
IN THE CASE OF ANY ONE ELSE I SHOULD HAVE OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MY OWN CONVICTIONS REMAINED UNSHAKEN
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE FARM HAD RETIRED TO BED AS USUAL MORE THAN AN HOUR SINCE
I RAN TO THE PLACE TO PART THEM
IT IS ONLY CERTAIN THAT THE LAWYER SPOKE MECHANICALLY DOING HIS BEST NO DOUBT BUT DOING IT WITHOUT GENUINE CONVICTION OR EARNESTNESS ON HIS OWN PART
JOHN JAGO IS KEEPING AWAY DO YOU SUPPOSE HE IS AFRAID OF AMBROSE AND SILAS SHE HESITATED
WHY DON'T THEY HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY AT ONCE SHE ASKED
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN MY PLACE HAVING MADE THE APPOINTMENT I ANSWERED IT SEEMS TO BE DUE TO YOURSELF TO KEEP IT
THE YOUNG FELLOW'S ENTHUSIASM COMMUNICATED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN TEPID DEGREE TO ME
DURING THE INTERVAL WHICH THUS ELAPSED CERTAIN EVENTS HAPPENED WHICH MAY BE BRIEFLY MENTIONED HERE BEFORE I CLOSE MY NARRATIVE
WITH THE OTHER SHE PUSHED ME AWAY WITHOUT CEREMONY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE
SHE WELCOMED ME WITH ONLY THE FAINT REFLECTION OF HER BRIGHT CUSTOMARY SMILE
DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY OTHER MOTIVE FOR HIS ABSENCE HER EYES DROPPED TO THE FLOOR
IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER THE WICKET-GATE AT THE END WILL LEAD YOU INTO THE LANE THROUGH SHEER THOUGHTLESSNESS I DID A VERY FOOLISH THING
ANYTHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE TRUTH IS IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE INVENTION OF THE AUTHOR.--W
CHAPTER XII
I STRONGLY SUSPECTED THE YOUNG FARMER OF SQUEEZING HER HAND PRIVATELY UNDER COVER OF THE TABLECLOTH
THE LAWYER STARTED
SHE HAD LOOKED AT ME FOR ONE MOMENT WHEN SHE KISSED MY HAND
TRYING AND TRYING VAINLY TO CONCEAL SOME STRONG AGITATION WHICH WAS IN POSSESSION OF HIM
SHE SNATCHED THE PAPER OUT OF MY HAND BEFORE I WAS AWARE OF HER DO YOU WANT IT BACK ASKED THE VOICE OF MISS MEADOWCROFT
I DRESSED IT MYSELF IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED FOR ANYTHING I KNOW IN MURDER SHE STOPPED AS THE WORD PASSED HER LIPS LOOKED BACK OVER HER SHOULDER AND STARTED VIOLENTLY
I HAVE GOT A PLACE TO OFFER YOU I REPLIED
THREE CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE NOT CERTAIN
IN HIS GREAT KNOTTY HANDS CLINGING CONVULSIVELY TO THE BAR AT WHICH HE STOOD
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I NOTICED AS I APPROACHED THAT HER PRETTY FACE WAS CLOUDED AND ANXIOUS
I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU
DON'T YOU THINK MR LEFRANK A MAN MUST BE A LITTLE MAD WHO SHOWS HIS GRIEF AT LOSING HIS WIFE BY VOWING THAT HE WILL NEVER SHAVE HIMSELF AGAIN
THE DOOR OPENED ON THE TRIM LITTLE FARM-GARDEN BATHED AT THAT MOMENT IN LOVELY MOONLIGHT
MY BRIGHT LITTLE FRIEND WAS IN SORE TROUBLE
WHEN A MAN ASKS ANYTHING OF A WOMAN THE WOMAN I FIND MOSTLY REPENTS IT IF SHE SAYS YES SHE MADE THAT QUAINT REFLECTION WITH A VERY TROUBLED BROW
I DON'T LIKE HIM JUST MY SENTIMENTS SIR
NAOMI BEGAN BY ASKING ME A QUESTION
NAOMI COLEBROOK AT LAST
MY CLERK WROTE TO INQUIRE IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF MY RETURNING TO ENGLAND IN TIME TO APPEAR IN COURT AT THE OPENING OF NEXT LAW TERM
SILAS YOU WILL STAY AT THE FARM THE BROTHERS WITHDREW TOGETHER
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT PASSED BETWEEN JOHN JAGO AND ME CHAPTER IX
WE BEGAN THE BATTLE OVER THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE RELATING TO THE CHARRED BONES
CHAPTER II
SHOULD I BE ALTOGETHER WRONG I ASKED IF I GUESSED THAT YOU WERE A LITTLE PARTIAL TO AMBROSE AN ENGLISHWOMAN WOULD HAVE FELT OR WOULD AT LEAST HAVE ASSUMED SOME LITTLE HESITATION AT REPLYING TO MY QUESTION
CHAPTER IV
CHAPTER VI
WHEN YOUR TIME COMES TO BE MARRIED SIR I GUESS THE WOMAN WON'T REPENT SAYING YES TO YOU MR MEADOWCROFT PRESERVED UNBROKEN SILENCE AS WE WALKED BACK TO THE FARM ON EITHER SIDE OF HIS INVALID-CHAIR
WE FOUND THEM AT LAST NEAR THE OUTSKIRTS OF A SMALL WOOD SITTING TALKING TOGETHER ON THE TRUNK OF A FELLED TREE
MEADOWCROFT WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
WHAT DID I TELL YOU NAOMI INSTANTLY APPLIED THE ANTIDOTE
WE RETURNED WONDERING TO THE FARM
A PERFECTLY SANE PERSON IN ALL HIS SAYINGS AND DOINGS SO FAR AS I COULD SEE THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING IN THOSE WILD BROWN EYES WHICH SUGGESTED TO ME THAT UNDER EXCEPTIONALLY TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES HE MIGHT SURPRISE HIS OLDEST FRIENDS BY ACTING IN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY VIOLENT OR FOOLISH WAY
BUT SAVING YOUR PRESENCE I'M D--D IF I TAKE HIS HAND FURTHER PERSUASION WAS PLAINLY USELESS ADDRESSED TO SUCH A MAN AS THIS
I BEGGED AND PRAYED OF HIM TO GET UP AND GO AWAY
DON'T NOTICE ME SHE TURNED AWAY
CAN I TAKE ANY LETTERS TO THE POST FOR YOU
TO MY HORROR AND AMAZEMENT I WAS PERFECTLY UNABLE TO COLLECT MY IDEAS
WHEN WE PARTED THAT NIGHT NAOMI LOOKED ALMOST LIKE HER BRIGHTER AND HAPPIER SELF
LITTLE AS I LIKED THE MAN HE DID REALLY IMPRESS ME AS A PITIABLE OBJECT AT THAT MOMENT
AS I PASSED THE BAR I SAW AMBROSE DEADLY PALE LOOKING AFTER US AS WE LEFT HIM
IT RESTS WITH YOU MISS NAOMI TO KEEP ME HERE AND TO PERSUADE ME TO SAVE AMBROSE BY SHOWING MYSELF AND OWNING TO MY NAME WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HEARD NAOMI ASK STERNLY
I WANT TO SEE YOU AND MR JAGO SHAKE HANDS JOHN JAGO INSTANTLY HELD OUT HIS HAND WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF GOOD FEELING WHICH WAS A LITTLE OVERACTED TO MY THINKING
WHY DID THE TONES OF HER VOICE DWELL ON MY EAR ALL THE WAY
WE WENT ON TOGETHER TO THE WOOD
WAS THERE EVER A MORE HOPELESS PROGRAMME THAN THIS
MANY IDLE LETTERS REACHED US RELATING TO THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR JOHN JAGO
I WAS LED OUT OF COURT THOROUGHLY TERRIFIED ABOUT MYSELF
FOR THE MOMENT MY OWN AGITATION ALMOST OVERPOWERED ME
HIS HANDS CLASPED LIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HIM TREMBLED INCESSANTLY
HE WAS PLAINLY IN EARNEST
HAVE YOU ANYTHING MORE TO TELL US I ASKED
AND AN OFFICER WAS DISPATCHED TO ARREST AMBROSE IN NEW YORK
ARRIVED AT THE GLASS DOOR I STOPPED AND LOOKED BACK AT THE GRAVEL-WALK
COME IN HERE ONE CANDLE ONLY WAS BURNING IN THE ROOM
OH MY
OH MY
WHEN THE TWO SONS SEIZED A STRAY REMARK OF MINE ABOUT ANIMALS IN GENERAL AND APPLIED IT SATIRICALLY TO THE MISMANAGEMENT OF SHEEP AND OXEN IN PARTICULAR THEY LOOKED AT JOHN JAGO WHILE THEY TALKED TO ME
THEY HAD EXPRESSLY DIRECTED THAT NO PERSONS SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO SEE THE PRISONER THAT DAY BUT THEMSELVES
JOHN JAGO HAD REFUSED TO MARRY HER
IT'S A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WHO HAS COME TO LIVE WITH US A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
HIS WILD BROWN EYES--WILDER THAN EVER IN THE MOONLIGHT--RESTED ENTREATINGLY WITH A STRANGE UNDERLYING EXPRESSION OF DESPAIR ON NAOMI'S FACE
AND I FOLLOWED MY DOCTOR'S ADVICE BY TAKING MY PASSAGE FOR AMERICA IN THE FIRST STEAMER THAT SAILED FOR NEW YORK
I WAS JUST LEAVING THE ROOM WHEN THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED AND NAOMI HERSELF STOOD BEFORE ME
I TOOK A BLIND UNREASONING HATRED TO MORWICK FARM
THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES
THE OLD MAN GOT MORE AND MORE DISSATISFIED ESPECIALLY ABOUT HIS BEASTS
HAD ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SUPPOSING THE INFLUENCE TO HAVE BEEN REALLY EXERTED THE NEXT QUESTION FOLLOWED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT IN VIEW
IT WAS ARGUED THAT THESE INDESTRUCTIBLE SUBSTANCES AND SOME FRAGMENTS OF THE LARGER BONES HAD ALONE ESCAPED THE ACTION OF THE BURNING LIME
I ADMIRE HER GOOD QUALITIES
GO ON
ON THE OTHER SIDE--ON MUCH THE LARGER HALF OF THE LAND MIND--THEY RAISE CATTLE
JOHN JAGO WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE AND JOHN JAGO WAS IDENTIFIED THE NEXT DAY
HERE'S THE SPY WHO SAW US LAST NIGHT ON THE WALK AND WHO TOLD SILAS DREARY MISS MEADOWCROFT OPENED THE KITCHEN DOOR
APPEARANCES CERTAINLY SUGGESTED THAT INQUIRY
OF COURSE IT WAS
HE SOLVED THE MYSTERY CAUTIOUSLY IN A WHISPER
WE DECLARED THAT THEY HAD BEEN EXTORTED BY TERROR OR BY UNDUE INFLUENCE
I HAD ONLY TOO CLEARLY FORESEEN WHAT HE WOULD FEEL IT TO BE HIS DUTY TO DO
BEFORE NOON THE NEIGHBORS BROUGHT STARTLING NEWS FROM THE PRISON TO THE FARM
HELP ME FRIEND LEFRANK TO ADVERTISE FOR HIM IN THE NEWSPAPERS I DREW BACK FROM HER IN SPEECHLESS DISTRESS
I LIGHTED THE CANDLES AND TOOK FROM MY PORTMANTEAU WHAT I FIRMLY BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST FRENCH NOVEL EVER PRODUCED AT MORWICK FARM
NOT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF THE LOST MAN TURNED UP
WHY WERE YOU BOTH AWAY AT PRAYERS AND BREAKFAST-TIME SHE ASKED NEXT
WHAT WILL MR LEFRANK THINK SHE SAID IF YOU TALK IN THAT WAY OF A PERSON WHOM YOUR FATHER RESPECTS AND TRUSTS
AND WHEN SHE IS SHAMED AS I AM SHE FEELS IT VERY BITTERLY
THE GRAND REPOSE OF NATURE HAD NEVER LOOKED SO UNUTTERABLY SOLEMN AND BEAUTIFUL AS IT NOW APPEARED AFTER WHAT I HAD SEEN AND HEARD INSIDE THE HOUSE
TOUCHED HIS HORSE WITH THE WHIP
MY VIEW FROM THE WINDOW SHOWED ME A DEAD FLAT IN A PARTIAL STATE OF CULTIVATION FADING SADLY FROM VIEW IN THE WANING LIGHT
THE GIRL'S HAND AS I TOOK IT TURNED COLD IN MINE
LIKED HER PLEASANT SMILE
A BIG PIECE OF THE CLOTH CAME AWAY IN MY HAND
BUT I THOUGHT THIS A BAD SIGN
SOME THIRD PERSON HAD BEEN LISTENING TO OUR TALK
BREAKFAST-TIME CAME AND DINNER-TIME CAME AND NO JOHN JAGO DARKENED THE DOORS OF MORWICK FARM
NEVER MIND SHE SAID CONFUSEDLY
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE SILAS FOR WRITING THAT CONFESSION SHE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME SIR HE SAID I SHALL BE GOING ON BUSINESS TO NARRABEE OUR MARKET-TOWN HERE
NAOMI NOTICED THE ALTERATION IN HER LOVER
AMBROSE HAD NOT TAKEN HIS LEAVE AS TENDERLY AS USUAL
HE TOOK UP THE BODY AND CAST IT INTO THE QUICKLIME AND THREW THE STICK IN AFTER IT
AND IN AN EVIL HOUR HE HEARD OF JOHN JAGO
I REALLY FELT A MILD FLUTTER OF ANTICIPATION AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING NAOMI WHEN WE DREW UP TOWARD THE CLOSE OF EVENING AT THE GATES OF MORWICK FARM
HIS LAST RESERVES OF RESOLUTION SEEMED TO HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER THE OVERWHELMING STRAIN LAID ON THEM BY THE PROCEEDINGS IN COURT
THE PUBLISHED NARRATIVE OF THIS STRANGE CASE IS ENTITLED THE TRIAL CONFESSIONS AND CONVICTION OF JESSE AND STEPHEN BOORN FOR THE MURDER OF RUSSELL COLVIN AND THE RETURN OF THE MAN SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN MURDERED
WE TOOK OUR NEXT OBJECTION WHEN THE CONFESSIONS WERE PRODUCED IN EVIDENCE
I COUNTED THE STROKES--MIDNIGHT
DID YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LEFT AMBROSE AND SILAS TOGETHER YES SUPPOSE SILAS TELLS AMBROSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING THE SAME IDEA AS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED HAD OCCURRED TO MY MIND
HE TURNED ABOUT IN SULKY SILENCE AND RETRACING HIS STEPS ALONG THE PATH DISAPPEARED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
LOOKED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SHEEPISH HESITATION
I AM THE PERSON SIR WHO HAS DRIVEN JOHN JAGO AWAY FROM MORWICK FARM
I WAS RIGHT
IS THIS THE DEFENSE I INQUIRED IN A WHISPER
AMBROSE LEANED OVER THE BAR TO SPEAK TO NAOMI BEFORE HE FOLLOWED THE JAILER OUT
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO ME
WHAT DID IT MEAN
AT LAST THE UNENDURABLY LONG MEAL SERVED WITH OSTENTATIOUS PROFUSION WAS AT AN END
HAD YOU OR YOUR BROTHER ANY FEAR AT THAT TIME OF THE CHARGE WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST YOU I SAID
HE HAD NOT SUFFERED FROM THE NERVOUS DERANGEMENT WHICH HAD WEAKENED ME AND HE WAS THE STRONGER MAN OF THE TWO
NO SIR
YOU KNOW THE SECRET NOW THERE HE STOPPED
STARK STARING MAD!--THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR HIM
SHE PUSHED THE CAT IRRITABLY OFF HER SHOULDER
ALL FOR YOUR SAKE NAOMI COLEBROOK--ALL FOR YOUR SAKE
I SAID I WOULD WAIT UNTIL SHE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO ME
JOHN JAGO AND I WERE ALONE
SILAS MEADOWCROFT MADE NO ADVANCE OF THE SAME FRIENDLY SORT ON HIS SIDE
I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN ASCENDED THE STAIRS AGAIN SUDDENLY
SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE THINGS SEEM TO GET WORSE AND WORSE
TOWARD SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING MY BED BECAME UNENDURABLE TO ME
I MEAN HIS BROTHER SILAS AND JOHN JAGO
AND I AM THE PERSON WHO CAN AND WILL BRING HIM BACK AGAIN THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER MANNER MORE THAN IN HER WORDS WHICH LET THE LIGHT IN SUDDENLY ON MY MIND
WITH HER FREE HAND SHE HELD HER HANDKERCHIEF OVER HER FACE SO AS TO HIDE IT FROM ME
THE GARDEN WILL DO HE POINTED TO A GRAVEL-WALK BEYOND US BATHED IN THE FULL FLOOD OF THE MOONLIGHT
HIS BLOOD WAS UP TOO I SUPPOSE
HE HAD HELPED US TO GET THE ORDER OF ADMISSION AND HE HAD ACCOMPANIED US TO THE PRISON
I REALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU MISS NAOMI
JUMP INTO THE BUGGY
THAT THE ONLY CHANCE OF SPARING HIS FAMILY THE DISGRACE OF HIS DEATH BY PUBLIC EXECUTION LAY IN MAKING A CONFESSION
HE LOOKED INTO THE KILN
THERE WAS NO DOUBT NOW ABOUT HIS VOICE AS HE ANSWERED SOFTLY FROM BELOW--"ALL RIGHT KEEP HIM TALKING TO YOU WHERE HE IS NOW I SAID TO NAOMI UNTIL I HAVE TIME TO GET ROUND BY THE OTHER WAY TO THE TOOL-HOUSE
A SLEEK BLACK CAT BALANCED HIMSELF ON HER SHOULDER WATCHING THE FLASHING MOTION OF THE KNIFE AS SHE PASSED IT RAPIDLY TO AND FRO ON THE LEATHER-COVERED SURFACE OF THE BOARD
I DON'T WISH TO DISTURB YOU OR TO DISTURB THIS GENTLEMAN HE PROCEEDED
I WAS ABLE WITHOUT EXCITING NOTICE FROM BELOW TO LOOK OUT
WHO IS MY MASTER HE ASKED
HOW ARE YOU ALL AT HOME SO WE STARTED ON THE WAY TO THE FARM
SILAS FOLLOWED HIM
BUT TO ASK ME TO BELIEVE AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE LIME-KILN THAT HE WAS STILL LIVING WAS TO ASK ME TO TAKE AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT'S STATEMENT FOR GRANTED AS A TRUE STATEMENT OF FACTS
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE YET
THE CASE AS STATED FOR THE PROSECUTION TOLD STRONGLY AGAINST THE SUSPECTED MEN
STILL--STILL STILL--_WHAT MISS NAOMI HE IS NOT LIKE HIMSELF SIR
I OWN I THREATENED HIM WITH THE STICK
WHEN HE STEPPED UP TO ME AND SHOWED HIS WEAPON I DROPPED THE STICK AND CLOSED WITH HIM
MY REPLIES TO THE LAWYER ACCURATELY EXPRESSED THE CONVICTION IN MY MIND
PHILIP LEFRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MR JAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US
A MAN GETS USED TO HIS STICK SIR
IN OTHER WORDS WE FORCED THE DOCTORS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DIFFERED WIDELY IN THEIR OPINIONS
I ROSE DIRECTLY TO APPROACH HIM
HE IS THE GREATEST LIAR IN AMERICA LET THE OTHER BE WHOM HE MAY NAOMI SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
THE NEXT TIME YOUR GOOD SPIRITS LEAD YOU INTO MAKING JOKES AT MR JAGO'S EXPENSE DON'T CARRY THEM QUITE SO FAR
WHAT SHALL I DO NAOMI REPEATED
SHE SUDDENLY STEPPED CLOSE UP TO ME AND LAID HER HAND ON MY ARM
IT WAS NOT ONLY USELESS BUT UNDESIRABLE THAT AMBROSE SHOULD KNOW OF THE QUARREL
HEART ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
YOU WILL NEVER BE TROUBLED WITH ME AGAIN
IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL IT HAD BEEN SHOWN FOR THE DEFENSE THAT THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON HAD TOLD AMBROSE WITH HIS FATHER'S KNOWLEDGE AND SANCTION THAT THE CASE WAS CLEARLY AGAINST HIM
AND HE PLEASED THE OLD FATHER
AND WE WERE DESTINED TO BE ONCE MORE DISAPPOINTED IN ANTICIPATING THAT THE SAME EVIDENCE WOULD INFLUENCE THE VERDICT OF THE JURY ON THE SIDE OF MERCY
DON'T YOU?)--HE LOOKED ABOUT PRIVATELY FOR HELP
SHUT THE DOOR I OBEYED HER
THERE WAS JOHN JAGO LOOKING UP AT ME IN THE MOONLIGHT DID HE SEE YOU YES
WON'T IT KEEP TILL TO-MORROW SHE SAID
THE LITTLE SLEEP I HAD WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED BY DREAMS
ONE OF YOU WILL BE ENOUGH
A SOUR SMILE OF SATISFACTION SHOWED ITSELF ON MISS MEADOWCROFT'S THIN LIPS
BUT IT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY TO MY MIND AS YOU BELIEVE THEN I WENT ON JOHN JAGO HAS CARRIED OUT HIS THREAT OF NOT RETURNING TO THE FARM
HE WAS NOT TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
ON OUR WAY TO THE CHAIRS ALLOTTED TO US IN THE MAGISTRATE'S COURT WE PASSED THE PLATFORM ON WHICH THE PRISONERS WERE STANDING TOGETHER
THE MEREST TRIFLE MISS COLEBROOK UPSETS A MAN'S TEMPER SOMETIMES
NO HE SAID
ON OCCASIONS OF THIS SORT--AND THEY HAPPENED FREQUENTLY--NAOMI STRUCK IN RESOLUTELY AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND TURNED THE TALK TO SOME HARMLESS TOPIC
IS IT IN A TELEGRAPH-OFFICE OR IN A DRY-GOODS STORE I ASTONISHED MY LITTLE AMERICAN FRIEND BY TAKING HER THEN AND THERE IN MY ARMS AND GIVING HER MY FIRST KISS
THE NEXT DAY HE ARRIVED AND FOLLOWED HIS BROTHER TO PRISON
AND THEN I WAS PERMITTED TO GO UPSTAIRS AND UNPACK MY PORTMANTEAU IN MY OWN ROOM
A FRIEND OF YOUR SISTER'S I SUPPOSE A FRIEND
SOMEHOW IN SPITE OF THAT JOHN JAGO GOT ROUND HIM
MAY I DIE IF IT ISN'T MY STICK
YES MISS IF YOU PLEASE AT YOUR LEISURE AND AT MR LEFRANK'S NAOMI HESITATED
NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
ONCE MORE NAOMI CHECKED ME
THERE IS NO LOVE NO TRUST NO PEACE AT MORWICK FARM
I DID MY BEST TO REASSURE NAOMI
THE MORWICK SECTION OF THE AMERICAN NATION ORGANIZED ITSELF ON THE SPOT
I DO NOT BELIEVE IT I ANSWERED
DID YOU NOTICE SILAS'S HAND
SILAS HAD SAID JOHN JAGO IS TOO SWEET ON NAOMI NOT TO COME BACK THAT'S SO NAOMI REMARKED WHEN I HAD REPEATED THE WORDS
IN REPLY TO MY INQUIRIES I WAS INFORMED THAT THE BONES THE KNIFE THE BUTTONS AND THE STICK HAD ALL BEEN FOUND TOGETHER IN A LIME-KILN THEN IN USE ON THE FARM
AND AGAIN I WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP
I GUESS WE'VE FOUND THE MORTAL REMAINS OF JOHN JAGO MISS THE MAN REPLIED
YOU WILL THINK MY OBSTINACY INVINCIBLE
I HATE YOU I SAID
SILAS MIGHT CONFESS TO HAVING TAKEN HIS BROTHER'S STICK AND MIGHT MENTION WHOSE HEAD HE HAD THREATENED WITH IT
THE HORSE WHICH HAD TAKEN AMBROSE TO NARRABEE WAS RIDDEN BACK TO THE FARM BY A GROOM FROM THE HOTEL
I HAVE PURPOSELY ABSTAINED FROM ENCUMBERING MY NARRATIVE WITH LEGAL DETAILS
HE LAUGHED AS HE TOOK IT FROM ME
WE APPEALED TO THE OLD ENGLISH LAW THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO CONVICTION FOR MURDER UNTIL THE BODY OF THE MURDERED PERSON WAS FOUND OR PROOF OF ITS DESTRUCTION OBTAINED BEYOND A DOUBT
IN WHICH OF HIS CHARACTERS DOES HE DISGRACE ME MOST
AFTER WAITING VAINLY FOR TEN MINUTES MR MEADOWCROFT TOLD HIS DAUGHTER TO READ THE PRAYERS
AND HE SAYS WHAT MADE YOU THROW AWAY THE KNIFE AMBROSE?'--'HOW DOES A MAN KNOW WHY HE DOES ANYTHING I SAYS WHEN HE DOES IT IN A PASSION?'--'IT'S A RIPPING GOOD KNIFE SAYS SILAS
I'M NOT TO BLAME SAID THE VOICE
I TURNED BACK AS I WAS TOLD AND LEFT THE BROTHERS TOGETHER AT THE GATE OF THE STABLE-YARD
THEY HATE EACH OTHER
WILL YOU BE THE MAN FRIEND LEFRANK IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THOUGH I KNEW NOTHING WOULD COME OF IT THAT I CONSENTED TO BE THE MAN
WE HAD A LITTLE MORE TALK ABOUT JOHN JAGO
SHE ANSWERED OBSTINATELY ALMOST DOGGEDLY I CAN'T SAY I ADDRESSED MYSELF TO AMBROSE
THE WHOLE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN IS WILD AND FLIGHTY
AND WE WAITED FOR HIM A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BY MR MEADOWCROFT'S OWN DIRECTIONS
I WAS ANGRY AND JEALOUS
PERHAPS IT'S A LIE
I HAVE SINCE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT NAOMI IN THESE DAYS OF OUR INTIMATE ASSOCIATION DISCOVERED THE TRUE NATURE OF THE FEELING WITH WHICH SHE HAD INSPIRED ME
WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO THE CLEARING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WOOD WHILE SILAS WAS TALKING TO ME
WE HAVE MADE IT UP MR LEFRANK
IT WAS FAR OTHERWISE WITH SILAS
I HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
HUSH
NAOMI DRIED HER TEARS AND GAVE ME A LITTLE GRATEFUL SQUEEZE OF THE HAND
I KNOW YOU ARE INNOCENT SHE WHISPERED AND GAVE HIM ONE LOOK OF LOVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS SHE FOLLOWED ME TO HER PLACE
WHEN I NEXT SAW HER HER MASK WAS ON ONCE MORE
A FEW OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN THE SEARCH WERE SEATED NEAR WATCHING HIM
I WAS HORRIBLY FRIGHTENED
AND I OWN IT FREELY NAOMI I THOUGHT THE WORST THAT COULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU AND JOHN HERE NAOMI STOPPED HIM WITHOUT CEREMONY
AMBROSE WOULD NEVER DECEIVE ME
ONE OF THE MORE INTELLIGENT OF THE LABORERS WAS DISPATCHED TO NARRABEE TO MAKE INQUIRIES
I SAW THE DOCUMENT
WHAT HAD JOHN JAGO SAID TO HER
A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE--TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY
A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT
LOOK AT THE BRIEFS WAITING FOR ME ON THAT TABLE
I AM AS CERTAIN OF IT AS EVER SHE REPLIED FIRMLY
THE BOYS ARE NO DOUBT DETAINED OVER THEIR WORK UNCLE SHE TURNED TO ME
SAY GOOD-BY NOW
THE SAME DAY THE RESULTS DECLARED THEMSELVES
WE MUST SAY GOOD-NIGHT
IT WAS BRUTAL OF HIM--THOUGH HE IS AMBROSE'S BROTHER--TO STRIKE JOHN WHO IS THE SMALLER AND WEAKER MAN OF THE TWO
FOR SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE REASON JOHN JAGO SEEMED TO BE ILL AT EASE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS YOUNG COUNTRYWOMAN
HE CAN'T TELL THE TRUTH TRY HIM AS YOU MAY
I HAD A PRIDE IN THE FARM MISS AND A PRIDE IN MY WORK
WHEN MR MEADOWCROFT GOT TOO OLD AND TOO SICK TO LOOK AFTER HIS FARM HIMSELF THE BOYS I MEAN AMBROSE AND SILAS DIVIDED THE WORK BETWEEN THEM
WHO ARE YOU SHE ASKED TURNING SHARPLY TOWARD THE STRANGER
HERE IS JOHN JAGO STEALING OUT AGAIN IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREE
A LIAR AND A COWARD
BEAR WITH ME MISS NAOMI HE SAID
IT WAS THE HEAVY BEECHEN STICK WHICH I HAD SNATCHED OUT OF SILAS'S HAND AND WHICH I HAD RESTORED TO AMBROSE ON HIS CLAIMING IT AS HIS OWN
SHE WAS CERTAIN OF THE RESULT
ABOVE THE HEAD OF MY SPRUCE WHITE BED HUNG A SCROLL BEARING A DAMNATORY QUOTATION FROM SCRIPTURE IN EMBLAZONED LETTERS OF RED AND BLACK
NAOMI'S BRIGHT EYES LOOKED UP AT ME FLASHING WITH INDIGNATION
AFTER AN ABSENCE OF AN HOUR THEY RETURNED INTO COURT WITH A VERDICT OF GUILTY AGAINST BOTH THE PRISONERS
I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN MY FRENCH NOVEL AND MY OWN ROOM
WHO WAS TO TELL NAOMI OF THIS LAST AND SADDEST OF ALL THE CALAMITIES WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HER
SOMETHING HAS UPSET HIS TEMPER I SAID
AND THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED AMBROSE
I HAD REFUSED TO DO THIS FROM THE FIRST
MAY I ASK WHO IT IS AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT CONSIDERED BEFORE HE REPLIED
I CAN'T GUESS WHAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE TO SAY TO ME WHICH CANNOT BE SAID BEFORE A THIRD PERSON
I BEG LEAVE TO BORROW IT THE LABORERS BURST OUT LAUGHING
SHAKE HANDS ON IT MR LEFRANK
THE WAR OF ANGRY WORDS WAS STILL GOING ON WHEN I JOINED THE MEN OUTSIDE
WHAT DO YOU THINK BETWEEN OURSELVES BETWEEN OURSELVES I THINK THE MAGISTRATE WILL COMMIT THEM FOR TRIAL ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER YES ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER CHAPTER VIII
THE TEARS ROLLED SLOWLY OVER HER CHEEKS
LET ME STRETCH OUT A BIT AND I'LL HAVE IT IN NO TIME INSTEAD OF FINDING THE KNIFE I CAME NIGH TO FALLING MYSELF INTO THE BURNING LIME
DINNER-TIME CAME AND THE BROTHERS APPEARED
HE IS SPARE AND WIRY
THE DAY OF THE ADJOURNED INQUIRY ARRIVED
THE FALSE WRETCH
AND HE GREW IRRITABLY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE MEREST TRIFLES
UPON MY SOUL THAT'S A COOL WAY OF PUTTING IT FOR A MAN IN YOUR PLACE
THE THREATENING LANGUAGE THEY HABITUALLY USED TOWARD HIM
DON'T STIR SHE ADDRESSED JOHN JAGO VERY RELUCTANTLY
I WILL GO WITH YOU HE ADDED
SHE NEVER OVERSTEPPED BY A HAIR-BREADTH THE SAFE LIMITS OF THE CHARACTER THAT SHE HAD ASSUMED
CHAPTER VII
AND WITH THE OTHER I CAUGHT HIM BY THE COLLAR OF HIS ROTTEN OLD COAT AND GAVE HIM A SHAKING THAT MADE HIS BONES RATTLE IN HIS SKIN
AMBROSE IS INNOCENT AND THE TIME HAS COME TO PROVE IT YOU FORGET I SAID THAT WE HAVE JUST FAILED TO PROVE IT JOHN JAGO IS ALIVE IN HIDING FROM US AND FROM ALL WHO KNOW HIM SHE WENT ON
SHE CAME BACK TO ME UNWILLINGLY LIKE A WOMAN ACTING UNDER SOME INFLUENCE WHICH THE UTMOST EXERTION OF HER WILL WAS POWERLESS TO RESIST
DO YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM IMMEDIATELY SIR
I PRESSED HER AGAIN
EVEN IF I WASN'T PROMISED TO AMBROSE I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU--NO
I SAW AMBROSE STRIKE THE DECEASED A TERRIBLE BLOW ON THE HEAD WITH HIS AMBROSE'S HEAVY STICK
FOR THE PRESENT AT LEAST
OH HE DID IT
SILAS SHOUTED OUT TO HIM BE OFF WITH YOU
THERE IS TEN STRIKING
THE ONE POINT GAINED IN CROSS-EXAMINATION BY THE DEFENSE RELATED TO THE CHARRED BONES
STILL SIR IT'S HARD TO BE SET ASIDE FOR A STRANGER
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT EVEN THEN
I LED HER OUT OF THE COURT INTO THE AIR
THE SAME MORBID DREAD OF RIDICULE WHICH HAD LED HIM TO ASSERT THAT HE CARED NOTHING FOR NAOMI WHEN HE AND SILAS HAD QUARRELED UNDER MY BEDROOM WINDOW MIGHT ALSO HAVE IMPELLED HIM TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF SECRETLY AND SUDDENLY FROM THE SCENE OF HIS DISCOMFITURE
BUT SHE WAITED RESOLUTELY UNTIL THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION
YOU HEARD WHAT WENT ON AT SUPPER-TIME
THERE HE SAID WHERE WE CAN SEE ALL ROUND US AND BE SURE THAT NOBODY IS LISTENING
PRODUCED BY JAMES RUSK THE DEAD ALIVE BY WILKIE COLLINS CHAPTER I
BUT FOR MY INTEREST IN NAOMI AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE-LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING BETWEEN HER AND AMBROSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER
I RESPECT HER
YOU ARE QUITE WRONG SIR IN WHAT YOU SUPPOSE TO HAVE PASSED BETWEEN THE YOUNG LADY AND ME SILAS TURNED ABOUT AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF IRONICALLY TO THE THREE LABORERS
BUT THERE WAS NO DISGUISING HIS WILD BROWN EYES OR THE PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF HIS SPARE WIRY FIGURE AS HE WALKED SLOWLY TO AND FRO IN THE MOONLIGHT WAITING FOR NAOMI
YOU DON'T THINK HE MEANS IT I SAYS
I WISH YOU GOOD-NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MR MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID-CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
NAOMI ENTERED ON HER NARRATIVE THE MOMENT I HAD GIVEN HER MY PLEDGE WITHOUT WASTING A WORD BY WAY OF PREFACE
THEIR VIOLENT QUARRELS WITH HIM WHICH HAD BECOME A PUBLIC SCANDAL THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHICH HAD ENDED ON ONE OCCASION AT LEAST IN A BLOW
NO MORE OF HIM SHE SAID STERNLY
WHAT A GOOD FELLOW YOU ARE CRIED THE OUTSPOKEN AMERICAN GIRL
HE APPROACHED DEFIANTLY A STEP OR TWO NEARER TO SILAS MEADOWCROFT
HE DECLARED ON HIS OATH THAT HE HAD SEEN HIS BROTHER AMBROSE COMMIT THE CRIME
AND I HAVE FURTHER TO REQUEST I ADDED ADDRESSING MYSELF TO SILAS THAT YOU WILL DO ME A FAVOR AS YOUR FATHER'S GUEST
ONCE MORE THE JUDGES CONSULTED AND ONCE MORE THEY OVERRULED OUR OBJECTION
USE YOUR INFLUENCE PRAY USE YOUR INFLUENCE TO SOFTEN THEM AND TO MAKE THEM ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES IN THIS WICKED HOUSE
I GUESS I MAY SAY TO YOU WHAT I COULDN'T SAY TO A STRANGER
THIS IS THE DEFENSE MR LEFRANK
SHE CLUNG TREMBLING WITH AGITATION TO MY ARM
HE SAID COME DOWN AND SPEAK TO ME
MR MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEWCOMER TO ME WITH A SIDE-GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT--A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
SILAS HAS LIED AWAY HIS BROTHER'S LIFE TO SAVE HIMSELF SHE SAID
THAT'S HIS ADDRESS IS IT SAID THE VOICE
YOUR BROTHER HAS NO RIGHT TO TAKE LIBERTIES WITH MY NAME
I WAS ONLY TOO ANXIOUS TO FIND HIM
AT REGULAR PERIODS I ACCOMPANIED NAOMI TO VISIT HIM IN THE PRISON
CHAPTER XI
THE COPY TO WHICH HE HAD REFERRED WAS A COPY OF THE WRITTEN CONFESSION OF SILAS MEADOWCROFT ON HIS RETURN TO PRISON
REST MEANS RUIN IN MY CASE AND WORK ADDED THE DOCTOR QUIETLY MEANS DEATH I STARTED
AND I HEARD HER SAY TO HERSELF SOFTLY BETWEEN HER TEETH VENGEANCE IS MINE I WILL REPAY SAITH THE LORD IT WAS THE REQUIEM OF JOHN JAGO PRONOUNCED BY THE WOMAN WHO LOVED HIM
AND DON'T COME BACK AGAIN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE BURNED IN THE KILN HE STOOD LOOKING AT US FOR A MINUTE FETCHING HIS BREATH AND HOLDING HIS TORN COAT ROUND HIM
I FELT SO SURE WE SHOULD HEAR OF HIM LONG BEFORE THIS DO YOU STILL FEEL SURE THAT HE IS LIVING I VENTURED TO ASK
WILL THAT DO FOR YOU HE TURNED WITH AN OATH AND FOLLOWED HIS BROTHER INTO THE WOOD
IT MADDENS ME ONLY TO THINK OF IT
OUR PRESENTIMENTS ARE SOMETIMES IN CERTAIN RARE CASES THE FAITHFUL PROPHECY OF THE FUTURE
NAOMI COLEBROOK SNATCHED THE PAPER OUT OF HIS HAND WHAT PAPER A DOOR OPENED SOFTLY BEHIND ME
AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME IF YOU HAD BEEN AS FOND OF HER AS I WAS
IN SIX WEEKS THE COURT FOR THE TRIAL OF CRIMINAL CASES WAS TO BE OPENED AT NARRABEE
WAS THE CONFESSION REALLY THE TRUE STATEMENT OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
SHE WAS MORE FIRMLY PERSUADED THAN EVER THAT AMBROSE WAS HIDING SOMETHING FROM HER WE ALL WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEXT DAY
LEARNED TO MAKE HERSELF USEFUL IN THE DAIRY IN A WEEK'S TIME
I WAS TOO ANGRY I TELL YOU TO LET HIM PASS QUIETLY
THERE IS A WEEK YET BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGINS
PRAY SIT DOWN SHE SEATED HERSELF BY MY SIDE LOOKING AT ME FRANKLY AND FEARLESSLY BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
I DON'T WANT TO EXCUSE SILAS EITHER
I WENT OUT WALKING ALONE TO THINK UNDISTURBEDLY
HAS MR JAGO NOT RETURNED I ASKED
GOD BLESS YOU SHE PUT MY HAND TO HER LIPS BEFORE I WAS AWARE OF HER AND KISSED IT AND RAN BACK INTO HER ROOM
I HOPE YOU HAVE NO PREJUDICE AGAINST AMERICANS
THE SITTINGS OF THE COURT BEGAN
HE HAD MADE ENDLESS INQUIRIES IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH THIS RESULT--NO ONE HAD SET EYES ON JOHN JAGO
HE DID FRIGHTEN ME
HE IS ONLY THOUGHTLESS
MORTIFIED PRIDE--DOUBLY MORTIFIED BY NAOMI'S CONTEMPTUOUS REFUSAL AND BY THE PERSONAL INDIGNITY OFFERED TO HIM BY AMBROSE--WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS CONDUCT IN ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM MORWICK
IN AMERICA THE WOMEN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
WHEN OLD MR MEADOWCROFT SPOKE DISPARAGINGLY TO HIS OVERLOOKER OF SOME PAST MISTAKE MADE IN THE CULTIVATION OF THE ARABLE LAND OF THE FARM OLD MR MEADOWCROFT'S EYES POINTED THE APPLICATION OF HIS HOSTILE CRITICISM STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS TWO SONS
BUT IT IS ONLY CANDID TO ADD THAT MY DOUBTS OF JOHN JAGO'S EXISTENCE REMAINED UNSHAKEN BY THE LETTER
WE DENIED THAT SUFFICIENT PROOF HAD BEEN OBTAINED IN THE CASE NOW BEFORE THE COURT
IF HE IS NOT A MURDERER WHAT ELSE IS HE
AND THOUGH WE DO LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES WE STICK FAST TO OUR ENGLISH WAYS AND HABITS
I HATE YOU HE SAW I WAS IN EARNEST AT LAST
SHE STEADILY PURSUED HER OWN TRAIN OF THOUGHT
HE MADE ME REPEAT IT AFTER HIM LIKE A LESSON
NAOMI HERSELF ANSWERED MY QUESTION
SHE HAS IMPOSED ON YOU AS SHE IMPOSES ON EVERYBODY ELSE
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE US FRIENDS WITH JOHN JAGO TRY AS YOU MAY
JOHN JAGO IMMEDIATELY RECOVERING HIS SELF-POSSESSION TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND MADE ME A DEFERENTIAL BOW
I HAVE DONE WITH IT NOW
BUT THERE WERE LEGAL DELAYS TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND LEGAL FORMALITIES TO BE OBSERVED BEFORE THE BROTHERS COULD BE RELEASED FROM PRISON IN THE CHARACTERS OF INNOCENT MEN
THE GIRL'S COURAGE ROSE WITH THE CALL WHICH WAS MADE ON IT
I HAD HARDLY BEEN A MINUTE IN THE TOOL-HOUSE BEFORE I HEARD HIM SPEAKING TO NAOMI ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
HE WAS ALWAYS A SPECULATING MAN AMBROSE WENT ON
HER HAIR WAS IN DISORDER
I WAS FAITHFUL TO MR MEADOWCROFT'S INTERESTS
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE FARM IT WAS EVENING
NAOMI FOLLOWED MY INSTRUCTIONS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INTELLIGENCE WHERE STRATAGEMS ARE CONCERNED
BUT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ADD IN THE WAY OF EXPLANATION THAT I AM A JUNIOR BARRISTER IN GOOD PRACTICE
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT EVERYWHERE THE THICK BEECHEN STICK HAD BEEN FEELING UNCOMFORTABLY HEAVY IN MY INVALID HAND FOR SOME TIME PAST
KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY IF YOU WANT TO KEEP A WHOLE SKIN ON YOUR BONES JOHN JAGO CAST ONE OF HIS SARDONIC SIDE-LOOKS AT THE FARMER'S WOUNDED LEFT HAND
NAOMI NODDED HER HEAD IN UNDISGUISED APPROVAL OF MY CANDOR
THE DISEASE YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM IS--OVERWORK
I HAVE SOMETHING SERIOUS TO SAY TO YOU DID YOU ANSWER HIM AS SOON AS I COULD CATCH MY BREATH I SAID WAIT A LITTLE AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO YOU
GOOD GOD I EXCLAIMED WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW SHE HANDED ME THE PAPER WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN FROM THE LAWYER'S HAND
DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME TO-NIGHT NAOMI ASKED IN UNDISGUISED SURPRISE
HE IS SOMEWHERE IN HIDING
TO HIS SURPRISE HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE CLERK HAD NOT APPEARED AT HIS DESK THAT DAY
IN THE POPULAR PHRASE I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY OWN EYES I READ THE LAST SENTENCES OF THE CONFESSION FOR THE SECOND TIME
THERE I SAT IN A FOOL'S ELYSIUM OF MY OWN MAKING WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN MY MIND BUT THE PICTURE OF NAOMI'S FACE AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD LAST LOOKED AT ME
AND THE SONS AGAIN RETURNED IT
HOW DARE HE DO IT SHE PAUSED
THAT STRAIGHTENED ME UP
IT IS NEEDLESS TO WASTE TIME IN RECAPITULATING HIS EVIDENCE
TRY MR LEFRANK WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY--PRAY TRY SIR TO MAKE PEACE AMONG THEM
BREAKFAST FOLLOWED
I PUT A QUESTION TO HIM--THE FIRST THAT I HAD ASKED YET
WHAT ELSE I WAS THINKING OF I CANNOT SAY
EVERY TIME SHE TOOK A PROMINENT PART IN THIS WAY IN KEEPING THE PEACE MELANCHOLY MISS MEADOWCROFT LOOKED SLOWLY ROUND AT HER IN STERN AND SILENT DISPARAGEMENT OF HER INTERFERENCE
CIRCUMSTANCES DECLARED THEMSELVES AGAINST US AT STARTING
WHEN SHE PUT THE PEN INTO MY HAND I BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF THE ADVERTISEMENT AS OBEDIENTLY AS IF I TOO BELIEVED THAT JOHN JAGO WAS A LIVING MAN
I BEG TO APOLOGIZE I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY MR JAGO I ANSWERED ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU AS THE OLDER MAN WILL SET THE EXAMPLE OF FORBEARANCE IF YOUR TEMPER IS TRIED ON ANY FUTURE OCCASION AS IT HAS BEEN TRIED TODAY
HE SEEMED TO BE ALMOST AS EAGER TO TELL AS NAOMI WAS TO HEAR THE TRUE STORY OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE LIME-KILN
AMBROSE AND SILAS MEADOWCROFT WERE CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF JOHN JAGO BY MEANS OF THE STICK OR BY USE OF SOME OTHER WEAPON AND WITH THE DELIBERATE DESTRUCTION OF THE BODY BY THROWING IT INTO THE QUICKLIME
MERCY WHAT FOOLS WOMEN ARE
HE SOBBED AND CRIED FOR LOVE OF ME
I KNOW NO MORE THAN YOU DO WHAT HE WANTS WITH ME
LET ME BY ON MY BUSINESS OR I MAY MARK YOU FOR A SECOND TIME SILAS LIFTED HIS BEECHEN STICK
WHETHER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE DISCOURAGED HIM OR WHETHER HE PRIVATELY SHARED MY OPINION OF HIS CLIENT'S STATEMENT I CANNOT SAY
BUT NOT EVEN DUMAS HIMSELF COULD KEEP MY ATTENTION TO THE STORY
HE HAD HIS ELBOWS ON THE GATE OF THE YARD SWINGING IT SLOWLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND TURNING AND TWISTING A STRAW BETWEEN HIS TEETH
DID SILAS SAY ANY MORE WHILE HE WAS ABOUT IT YES
THE CHEERFUL SPEECH AND EASY MANNER OF AMBROSE PLAINLY INDICATED THAT HE WAS IGNORANT THUS FAR OF THE QUARREL WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE UNDER MY WINDOW
I MUST BE OFF TO NARRABEE WHAT DOES IT MEAN
PUBLIC FEELING JUDGED HIM ON THE SPOT
IMMEDIATELY ON MY ARRIVAL I WAS PRESENTED TO MR MEADOWCROFT THE FATHER
MISS MEADOWCROFT LOOKED AT HER FATHER AND SAID FROM BAD TO WORSE SIR
ONLY LET ME FIND OUT WHERE HE HAS GONE AND I'LL ENGAGE HE SHALL COME BACK AND CLEAR AMBROSE OF THE SUSPICION WHICH HIS VILE BROTHER HAS CAST ON HIM
AND I NOW FURTHER OBSERVED THAT JOHN JAGO'S WANDERING BROWN EYES FURTIVELY LOOKING AT EVERYBODY ROUND THE TABLE IN TURN LOOKED WITH A CURIOUS CYNICAL SCRUTINY AT THE YOUNG MAN'S INJURED HAND
AND PLEASANT DREAMS WITH ONE HAND SHE TOOK MINE AND PRESSED IT CORDIALLY
MISS MEADOWCROFT INFORMED HER OF THE RESULT OF THE TRIAL
WE COULD ONLY WAIT AND SEE
AND THEN TO MY ASTONISHMENT THE OUTWARDLY MERCILESS WOMAN SHOWED ME THAT SHE TOO WAS ONE OF EVE'S DAUGHTERS AND COULD FEEL AND SUFFER IN HER OWN HARD WAY LIKE THE REST OF US
WE THREE HAD A DREARY LITTLE INTERVIEW IN A PARLOR OF BARE WALLS
SHE TURNED HER FACE ON ME WITH THE DEEP-RED FLUSH OF SHAME IN IT AND THE BIG TEARS GLISTENING IN HER EYES
WAS SOME POTENT INFLUENCE BEING BROUGHT PRIVATELY TO BEAR ON AMBROSE
THE NIGHT WORE ON AND STILL THE ABSENT MAN FAILED TO RETURN
AMBROSE SUDDENLY STEPPED OUT OF THE DARK CORNER OF THE ROOM
I UNDERSTAND THE DRIFT OF YOUR CATECHISM SIR THOUGH MY BROTHER DOESN'T HE SAID
THERE'S NOTHING AGAINST JOHN JAGO EXCEPT THAT HE IS SO ODD IN HIS WAYS
AH
AH
A LARGE CLOAK WAS THROWN OVER HER
IN SUBSTANCE AMBROSE CONFESSED WHAT SILAS HAD CONFESSED
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE SIR
I PUT THE QUESTION WITH ALL NEEDFUL DELICACY MAKING MY APOLOGIES BEFOREHAND
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU NAOMI BEGAN YOU DON'T THINK ILL OF ME FOR FOLLOWING YOU OUT HERE
HIS BROTHER AMBROSE WITH EQUAL RESOLUTION ASSERTED HIS INNOCENCE AND REITERATED THE STATEMENT WHICH HE HAD ALREADY ADVANCED
I WILL INQUIRE HE SAID
THE EVENING CAME
WE STOOD STARING AT EACH OTHER LIKE A COUPLE OF FOOLS
THE DISTANT SOUND OF A DOOR CLOSED SOFTLY CAME TO US THROUGH THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
DIED SIR LEAVING BARELY ENOUGH TO BURY HIM
COME UPSTAIRS WITH ME HER ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE AND WAS THE ONLY BEDROOM WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE BACK-YARD
THE BUTTONS NAOMI HERSELF DECLARED TO HAVE A PECULIAR PATTERN ON THEM WHICH HAD FORMERLY ATTRACTED HER ATTENTION TO JOHN JAGO'S COAT
ISN'T IT
MISS MEADOWCROFT READ THEREUPON IN THE TONE OF AN INJURED WOMAN TAKING THE THRONE OF MERCY BY STORM AND INSISTING ON HER RIGHTS
MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR JAGO
WHY DID MY HAND STILL FEEL THE LAST COLD FAINT PRESSURE OF HER FINGERS WHEN I LED HER OUT OF COURT
DID YOU FIND HER OPEN TO PERSUASION SIR
WHO SAYS I'VE LOST IT YET I ANSWERED HIM
I ROSE TO GO UP TO MY ROOM
THE CONFESSION
I SAW YOU FROWN TO YOURSELF
MISS MEADOWCROFT AND I WERE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FAMILY AT THE FARM WHO ATTENDED THE TRIAL
I WISHED MYSELF BACK IN ENGLAND
KNOWING HOW I LOVED HER IN SECRET I FELT AN INVINCIBLE RELUCTANCE TO BE THE PERSON WHO REVEALED AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT'S DEGRADATION TO HIS BETROTHED WIFE
AND HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TAKE THE YOKE ON HIS SHOULDERS FOR THE SECOND TIME GREATLY TO MY SURPRISE JOHN JAGO MET THIS CLUMSY JESTING WITH A FORMAL AND SERIOUS REPLY
I HATE YOU MR JAGO
I MAY AS WELL MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT AT STARTING MY GIRL
YOU PUT IT A DEAL TOO MILDLY SIR WHEN YOU SAY THE MEN DON'T SEEM TO BE ON FRIENDLY TERMS TOGETHER HERE
MISS MEADOWCROFT IT SHOULD BE HERE ADDED POSITIVELY REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT JOHN JAGO HAD EVER ASKED NAOMI TO BE HIS WIFE OR HAD EVER THREATENED HER AS I HAD HEARD HIM THREATEN HER IF SHE REFUSED
I WAITED WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT
YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT TO SEE AMBROSE IN THE PRISON SHE SAID
NAOMI SAVED MY LIFE
HE RECEIVED ME KINDLY AND A LITTLE WEARILY AS WELL
WE ARE TURNED OUT TOGETHER FRIEND LEFRANK SAID NAOMI WITH HER QUAINTLY-COMICAL SMILE
THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE IS CONCEALED BY A THICK BLACK BEARD AND MUSTACHE
PHILIP LEFRANK DON'T ALARM YOURSELF
GO AWAY AT ONCE
IT MIGHT MERELY HAVE INDICATED NATURAL NERVOUS AGITATION AS THE TIME FOR THE TRIAL DREW NEAR
HE DELIVERED A WRITTEN MESSAGE FROM AMBROSE WHICH STARTLED US
WITH ONE HAND I WRENCHED THE KNIFE AWAY FROM HIM
AMBROSE NEVER LOST HIS SELF-CONTROL
BUT AMBROSE AND SILAS ARE NOT MURDERERS
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS I REMEMBERED PERFECTLY
IT'S JUST THE NICEST GIRL SIR YOU EVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE AY AY
TWO DAYS LATER THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION TOOK PLACE
AND I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IN YOU ENGLISHMEN THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO SPEAK ONE'S MIND PLAINLY TO NAOMI
THE SUPPER WAS NOT A MERRY ONE
IN RETURN FOR A BLOW THIS PLAIN REVELATION OF THE STATE OF THINGS AT MORWICK FARM RATHER STAGGERED ME--BLOWS AND KNIVES UNDER THE RICH AND RESPECTABLE ROOF-TREE OF OLD MR MEADOWCROFT--BLOWS AND KNIVES NOT AMONG THE LABORERS BUT AMONG THE MASTERS
I SNATCHED MY GOWN OUT OF HIS HAND AND I GAVE HIM MY WHOLE MIND
I SAW THAT AS PLAINLY AS I SAW NAOMI HERSELF
JOHN JAGO NEVER APPEARED
AT TEN O'CLOCK HE PAUSED AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME
I LOOKED AT HER BY THE DIM LIGHT
YES AND WAS THAT WHAT MADE YOU LEAVE ME WHEN YOU WENT AWAY TO NARRABEE WITHOUT GIVING ME A KISS AT PARTING IT WAS BEG MY PARDON FOR IT BEFORE YOU SAY A WORD MORE I BEG YOUR PARDON SAY YOU ARE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF I AM ASHAMED OF MYSELF AMBROSE ANSWERED PENITENTLY
WHAT NEXT AT MORWICK FARM
I CAN'T BEAR THAT
THE DISGRACEFUL SCENE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE UNDER MY WINDOW
THE WRETCHES IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE WICKED ENOUGH TO SAY THAT HIS ABSENCE IS A CONFESSION OF HIS GUILT SHE WAS RIGHT
THEN HE SPOKE WITH A DEADLY-QUIET VOICE AND A DEADLY-QUIET LOOK
IN THE BACK-YARD SHE REPLIED UNDER MY BEDROOM WINDOW THE EMERGENCY WAS FAR TOO SERIOUS TO ALLOW OF ANY CONSIDERATION FOR THE SMALL PROPRIETIES OF EVERY-DAY LIFE
AS HE GOT ON HIS FEET I NOTICED THAT HIS BROTHER WHISPERED SOMETHING IN HIS EAR
NAOMI IS HIS SWEETHEART NOT MINE
JOHN JAGO HAD DISAPPEARED AGAIN NOBODY KNEW WHERE
THE OCEAN AIR IS THE BEST OF ALL AIR TO BUILD YOU UP AGAIN
NAOMI SLIPPED OUT AFTER THEM
THE ENVELOPE INCLOSED A LETTER AND WITH IT A SLIP OF PAPER ON WHICH NAOMI HAD HURRIEDLY WRITTEN THESE WORDS
WAIT HE WHISPERED CONFIDENTLY TILL THEY HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY NAOMI KISSED HER HAND TO HIM AFFECTIONATELY AND TURNED TO ME WITH THE BRIGHT TEARS IN HER EYES
HOW MANY MORE QUESTIONS AM I TO ANSWER HE BROKE OUT VIOLENTLY
IT'S A CRYING SHAME SIR TO SEND HIM BACK TO PRISON
IF ANY ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED WHICH GOD FORBID WE MAY HAVE TO INQUIRE IN MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION
I HAVE NO HOPES AND NO PROSPECTS NOW
HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE HOTEL AND HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO MORWICK
MY SONS HAVE BEHAVED BADLY AND UNGRATEFULLY TOWARD JOHN JAGO
HARK
GO YOU AMBROSE
LET HIM GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS SAID SILAS
OR HAD THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE FAMILY NAME PERSUADED AMBROSE TO TRY THIS DESPERATE MEANS OF ESCAPING THE IGNOMINY OF DEATH ON THE SCAFFOLD
PERFECTLY AMBROSE TOLD US OF SOMETHING WHICH HIS VILLAIN OF A BROTHER SAID OF JOHN JAGO AND ME
I BELIEVED IT TO BE NOTHING MORE NOR LESS THAN A HEARTLESS AND STUPID HOAX THE STRIKING OF THE HALL-CLOCK ROUSED ME FROM MY MEDITATIONS
MR MEADOWCROFT AND HIS DAUGHTER CONSULTED TOGETHER AND DETERMINED TO SEND IN SEARCH OF THE MISSING MAN
WITH THE SILENT SANCTION OF MR MEADOWCROFT AND HIS DAUGHTER I WENT TO NARRABEE AND SECURED THE BEST LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENSE WHICH THE TOWN COULD PLACE AT MY DISPOSAL
HERE THE PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS ENDED
WHEN I BEGGED HIM TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF HE ONLY ANSWERED ASK MR LEFRANK
WE TWO BANISHED ONES MET THE SAME DAY IN THE HALL WITH OUR TRAVELING-BAGS IN OUR HANDS
PROMISE YOU WON'T GO AWAY AND LEAVE US WHEN YOU KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
I GAVE HIM A BIT OF MY MIND
IT GREATLY INCREASED HER ANXIETY THOUGH IT NEVER SHOOK HER CONFIDENCE IN AMBROSE
AND YOU GUESSED RIGHT WHEN YOU GUESSED THAT WE HAD A SECRET FROM YOU
ABJECT TERROR SHOWED ITSELF IN HIS GHASTLY FACE
AND SUDDENLY BURST OUT WITH THE TRUTH IN THE PLAINEST POSSIBLE WORDS
THE FRENCH SPELLING OF MY NAME LEFRANC WAS ANGLICIZED GENERATIONS SINCE--IN THE DAYS WHEN THE LETTER K WAS STILL USED IN ENGLAND AT THE END OF WORDS WHICH NOW TERMINATE IN C WE HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH NEVERTHELESS AS A JERSEY FAMILY
THE PROSTRATION OF SILAS AT THE CLOSE OF THE INQUIRY WAS SO COMPLETE THAT IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO HAVE TWO MEN TO SUPPORT HIM ON HIS LEAVING THE COURT
JOHN GIVES THE ORDERS NOW
ARRIVED AT THE GARDEN A THOUGHT STRUCK ME
ON THE STAIRCASE I MET MISS MEADOWCROFT ASCENDING TO HER OWN ROOM
HIS PRIDE IS IN HIS BEASTS
I ANSWERED WITHOUT HESITATION IT IS STILL IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FIX THE DATE OF MY RETURN NAOMI WAS IN THE ROOM WHILE I WAS WRITING
ON THEIR SIDE THE PROSECUTION PRODUCED ONE NEW WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CASE
BUT IF SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN LEFT IN THE WORLD AND IF I WAS A MUCH YOUNGER MAN THAN I AM I SHOULD NEVER THINK OF ASKING HER TO BE MY WIFE HE BURST OUT SUDDENLY INTO A HARSH UNEASY LAUGH
I DREW OUT THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR INSERTION IN THE MORWICK MERCURY IN THESE TERMS
BUT WHEN NAOMI MADE HER APPEARANCE SHE CONQUERED US ALL
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTRUDE ON YOUR SECRETS MISS COLEBROOK WITH THAT ACRID ANSWER OUR PRIESTESS TOOK HERSELF AND HER PRAYER-BOOK OUT OF THE KITCHEN
I JOINED NAOMI ENTERING THE ROOM BY THE GARDEN DOOR
SINGULARLY PALE FOR A PERSON WHOSE LIFE WAS PASSED IN THE COUNTRY
WHO SNATCHED THE PAPER OUT OF YOUR HAND I ASKED BLUNTLY
THEN SUDDENLY FLUSHED AGAIN TO THE DEEPEST RED
I ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED ON ME AT SUPPER-TIME JUST AS PLAINLY AS I HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED IT IN THESE PAGES
BUT THERE WAS NO MARKED CHARACTER IN EITHER FACE
THE TELEGRAPH BROUGHT US OUR FIRST NEWS OF AMBROSE
AND AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT WE TOOK THE PATH THAT LED BY THE LIME-KILN
PLEASE TO GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES THIS EVENING HE ADVANCED A STEP TOWARD HER
HE COMES FROM OUT WEST WHERE THEY ARE ALWAYS READY WITH ONE WEAPON OR ANOTHER HANDY IN THEIR POCKETS
CLAIMING HOWEVER TO HAVE ONLY STRUCK JAGO UNDER INTOLERABLE PROVOCATION SO AS TO REDUCE THE NATURE OF HIS OFFENSE AGAINST THE LAW FROM MURDER TO MANSLAUGHTER
THE ADVERTISEMENT
THEN BOWED HER GRAY HEAD IN SILENCE AND LEFT ME
WHEN WE BEGAN OUR MEAL I HAD NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SILAS MEADOWCROFT'S LEFT HAND WAS STRAPPED UP WITH SURGICAL PLASTER
HE DENIES IT
DON'T FORGET YOUR OWN SKIN MR SILAS WHEN YOU THREATEN MINE
WE WENT SEPARATELY TO NARRABEE
THE BEECHEN STICK
THE COURTS ARE SITTING
SHE SEATED HERSELF AND POINTED TO A CHAIR NEAR HER
UPON THIS HE WROTE TO MORWICK FARM TO SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN A MAN EXACTLY ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF JOHN JAGO BUT BEARING ANOTHER NAME WORKING AS A CLERK IN A MERCHANT'S OFFICE IN JERSEY CITY
BUT I HAVE GOT MY WORK TO DO THIS MORNING AND SILAS HAS HIS WORK TOO
TWO WENT STILL FURTHER AND DECLARED THAT THE BONES WERE THE BONES OF AN ANIMAL NOT OF A MAN
I HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY DRESSING MYSELF WHILE THE ALTERCATION WAS PROCEEDING
TRIED ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND FAILED IN ALL
A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF WAS TIED OVER HER HEAD
I TELL YOU THIS--SHE HASN'T BEEN WITH US QUITE TWO MONTHS YET AND WE WONDER ALREADY HOW WE EVER GOT ON WITHOUT HER ONCE STARTED ON THE SUBJECT OF NAOMI COLEBROOK AMBROSE HELD TO THAT ONE TOPIC AND TALKED ON IT WITHOUT INTERMISSION
I WITHDREW TO MY ROOM
BUT I'LL SWEAR TO IT I MEANT HIM NO HARM
IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF SMOLDERING ENMITIES AT MORWICK FARM THE PRETTY AMERICAN GIRL AND I REMAINED FIRM AND TRUE FRIENDS FROM FIRST TO LAST
THEN RAISED HER EYES SADLY TO THE CEILING AND SAID WE CAN ONLY PRAY FOR THEM SIR NAOMI DISAPPEARED AFTER DINNER
HE OWNED THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THAT IT HAD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED HIM TO KEEP IN HIDING
LATER IN THE DAY THE REASONABLENESS OF THIS SERIOUS VIEW OF THE CASE WAS CONFIRMED IN THE POPULAR MIND BY A STARTLING DISCOVERY
IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF THAT THE DEVIL TEMPTED HIM TO BREAK HIS PROMISE AND LEAVE THE FARM
SHE TRIED TO RUN BACK
HOW WOULD SHE HAVE ANSWERED I WONDER IF I HAD TOLD HER THE TRUTH AND SAID YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS LETTER CHAPTER X
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT I ROSE TO SPEAK TO THE LAWYER WHOSE SERVICES I HAD RETAINED
IT MEANT THIS
ALL WE FEARED WAS THAT THE OLD MAN MIGHT HEAR OF THE QUARREL AND BE BITTERER AGAINST US THAN EVER
SUPPER WILL BE AT NINE O'CLOCK SIR SAID MISS MEADOWCROFT
YES
THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE DECIDED UPON THIS THAT A SECOND EXAMINATION SHOULD BE MADE AND THAT THE MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL EXPERTS SHOULD BE INCREASED
HIS VOICE FALTERED AND DROPPED TIMIDLY TO A WHISPER
NAOMI HERSELF APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD
THAT'S THE TRUTH
I SAY AGAIN AT PARTING WHAT I HAVE SAID ALREADY
RETURNING TO THE GARDEN I HEARD A PLEASANT VOICE WISHING ME GOOD-MORNING I LOOKED ROUND
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIS ADDRESS FOR SHE ASKED SHARPLY
WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT ADDED HIS DAUGHTER
HE DROPPED HIS CLUMSY IRONY AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF DIRECTLY TO JOHN JAGO IN A TONE OF SAVAGE CONTEMPT
I AM VERY MUCH ASHAMED OF MYSELF SIR
THERE WAS A STRONG FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN THEM AMBROSE BEING THE TALLER AND THE HANDSOMER MAN OF THE TWO
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CALLING HER NOT YOUR STYLE YOU IMPUDENT BEGGAR
WHAT IS THE HORRID PERVERSITY SIR WHICH MAKES US ALWAYS READY TO PITY THE MEN
HOW COULD WE FORESEE THAT THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SEARCH THE KILN AND SAY WHAT THEY HAVE SAID OF US
I BEG OF YOU NOT TO LEAVE THE FARM
DID SHE SAY YES JOHN JAGO KEPT HIS TEMPER
DO YOU LIKE JOHN JAGO MR LEFRANK SO FAR NO
DON'T GO AND MISJUDGE AMBROSE SIR
SUCH A GIRL
IN ONE CORNER SITTING BY HER FATHER AND HOLDING HIS HAND WE SAW STERN AND STONY MISS MEADOWCROFT WEEPING SILENTLY
MR
MISS MEADOWCROFT WAS HERSELF AGAIN
WE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO STAND MUCH ON CEREMONY IN AMERICA YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT IN AMERICA
WILL MISCHIEF COME OF IT I ASKED MYSELF AS I CLOSED THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE HOUSE
GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE NEVER TO TELL ANY LIVING SOUL WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU TO-NIGHT--YOUR SACRED PROMISE TO THE MAN WHOSE LIFE YOU HAVE BROKEN I DID AS HE BADE ME
IF YOU MUST HAVE YOUR JOKE MR SILAS HE SAID QUIETLY AND FIRMLY BE PLEASED TO JOKE ON SOME OTHER SUBJECT
THEN PRETEND TO BE FEARFUL OF DISCOVERY AT THE DAIRY AND BRING HIM ROUND THE CORNER SO THAT I CAN HEAR HIM BEHIND THE DOOR WE LEFT THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND SEPARATED SILENTLY
HER VOICE LOOK AND MANNER SUDDENLY CHANGED
IT WAS SOMETHING OF QUITE ANOTHER KIND WITH WHICH YOU HAVE NO CONCERN
THEY DO SAY HE WEARS ALL THAT NASTY HAIR ON HIS FACE I HATE HAIR ON A MAN'S FACE ON ACCOUNT OF A VOW HE MADE WHEN HE LOST HIS WIFE
I DON'T DENY THAT EITHER
DO ME ONE LAST FAVOR
HE MAY BE AFRAID OF THEM SHE REPLIED WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE WORD MAY BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT LIKELY SHE HESITATED AGAIN
I DID
WITNESS AFTER WITNESS DEPOSED TO THE INVETERATE ENMITY AGAINST THE DECEASED DISPLAYED BY AMBROSE AND SILAS
THE FOOTSTEPS STOPPED AND THE VOICES BECAME RECOGNIZABLE
THE JUDGES CONSULTED AND DECIDED THAT THE TRIAL SHOULD GO ON
AND THUS DID TIME AND CHANCE FULFILL MY FIRST HASTY FOREBODING OF THE DULL LIFE I WAS TO LEAD AT MORWICK FARM
HE HAD SIGNED THE CONFESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR ON THAT VERY DAY
AND YOU MAY AS WELL TELL US THE TRUTH FOR ONCE IN A WAY
THE CLEAR YOUNG VOICE ANSWERED ME SADLY I AM TRYING TO BEAR IT
IF YOU GO BACK BY THE WAY YOU CAME YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN THE GARDEN
I LOOKED ROUND ME WHEN I STEPPED OUT OF THE RAILWAY-CARRIAGE ON THE PLATFORM AT MORWICK STATION
TURNING THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE AND WALKING ON FOR A LITTLE WAY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STABLES AND FACE TO FACE WITH SILAS MEADOWCROFT ONCE MORE
I AM NOT QUITE EASY ABOUT SOMETHING SHE SAID
LET IT BE SAYS SILAS
AND YOU WERE DISGUSTED WITH IT
SHE SPOKE TO ME WITH A STRANGE COMPOSURE
ACCORDING TO YOU HE IS NOW ALIVE AND IN HIDING SOMEWHERE CERTAINLY SAID AMBROSE
WE MIGHT TELEGRAPH TO NEW YORK I SUGGESTED IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHERE A MESSAGE WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND HIM I KNOW THE HOTEL WHICH THE MEADOWCROFTS USE AT NEW YORK SHE REPLIED
I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY WITH THESE WORDS MY MEDICAL FRIEND LEFT THE ROOM
I OWN I BELIEVED THAT THE NEW MISERY WHICH HAD FALLEN ON HER HAD AFFECTED HER BRAIN
SHOW YOURSELF AT THE WINDOW AND SAY TO HIM I AM COMING DIRECTLY THE BRAVE GIRL OBEYED ME WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION
I HAVE DONE WITH HIM FOREVER
IF SILAS HAD NOT CAUGHT THE KNIFE IN HIS HAND HIS HAND'S AWFULLY CUT I CAN TELL YOU
I SAT DOWN ON THE PLACE WHICH SHE HAD OCCUPIED
THE PROPER APPLICATIONS WERE MADE FORTHWITH TO A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND THE JUSTICE ISSUED HIS WARRANT
AMBROSE WILL NEED A LITTLE COMFORT BY THAT TIME SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED AT THE DAY'S LETTERS LYING ON THE TABLE
BUSINESS HE SAID IN ANSWER TO NAOMI NOT VERY GRACIOUSLY--"BUSINESS BETWEEN SILAS AND ME
HE OUGHT TO BE HERE SHE SAID TO ME
HAVING PRODUCED MEDICAL WITNESSES TO SUPPORT THIS THEORY BY DECLARING THE BONES TO BE HUMAN AND HAVING THUS CIRCUMSTANTIALLY ASSERTED THE DISCOVERY OF THE REMAINS IN THE KILN THE PROSECUTION NEXT PROCEEDED TO PROVE THAT THE MISSING MAN HAD BEEN MURDERED BY THE TWO BROTHERS AND HAD BEEN BY THEM THROWN INTO THE QUICKLIME AS A MEANS OF CONCEALING THEIR GUILT
AS FOR THE STICK BURNED AS IT WAS I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING THE QUAINTLY-CARVED KNOB AT THE TOP
NOW THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS ON ITS WAY TO THE PRINTING-OFFICE SHE WAS MORE THAN SANGUINE
I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU SHE BEGAN WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE LAST WORD
WAS SHE HIDING HERSELF FROM ME NOW
I RETURNED TO MY FRENCH NOVEL
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT A METHODIST PREACHER LATELY SETTLED AT MORWICK AND GREATLY RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT HAD DREAMED OF JOHN JAGO IN THE CHARACTER OF A MURDERED MAN WHOSE BONES WERE HIDDEN AT MORWICK FARM
MR JAGO MUST HAVE BEEN DETAINED FOR THE NIGHT AT NARRABEE THE DAILY ROUTINE OF THE MEALS RESUMED ITS UNALTERABLE COURSE
BUT I AM NOW DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THIS WAS THE EPOCH AT WHICH I BEGAN TO ENVY AMBROSE THE WIFE WHOM HE HAD WON
I BELIEVE HE HONESTLY MEANT TO KEEP HIS WORD AS LONG AS MY EYE WAS ON HIM
I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL TO YOU FRIEND LEFRANK
YOU ARE A STRANGER MR LEFRANK OR YOU WOULD NEVER TALK TO ME IN THAT WAY
MORE THAN THIS IT WAS AGAIN IN MY EXPERIENCE I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT HE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE CRITICAL POSITION OF AMBROSE A MEANS OF EXTORTING NAOMI'S CONSENT TO LISTEN FAVORABLY TO HIS SUIT
MR MEADOWCROFT WOULD SEE NOBODY BUT HIS DAUGHTER AND HIS DOCTOR AND OCCASIONALLY ONE OR TWO OLD FRIENDS
I AM GOING TO BREAK A SACRED PROMISE
THE MAN WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR PORTMANTEAU WITH EQUALLY CONVENTIONAL POLITENESS I ANSWERED THANK YOU
WE DON'T MUCH LIKE AMERICAN WOMEN IN GENERAL I CAN TELL YOU
MISS MEADOWCROFT RETURNED WITH US TO THE FARM PRESERVING UNBROKEN SILENCE ON THE WAY BACK
THEY WERE HAVING WORDS ABOUT COUSIN NAOMI
I DREW HER TO THE WINDOW-SEAT
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IT WAS LIKE THE MOONLIGHT ON THE FATAL EVENING WHEN NAOMI HAD MET JOHN JAGO ON THE GARDEN WALK
JOHN JAGO HAD RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE
MY RESOLUTION TO RETURN TO ENGLAND INSTANTLY BECAME ONE OF THE LOST IDEAS OF MY LIFE
I WAS NOT IN TIME
HER DOWNCAST EYES STILL OBSTINATELY AVOIDED MEETING MINE
SUCH WAS THE RESULT OF MY VOYAGE ACROSS THE OCEAN IN SEARCH OF REST AND QUIET
YOU WILL GO BACK TO ENGLAND I GUESS
DON'T YOU SEE THAT I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK YOU IN THE FACE SHE SAID IN LOW BROKEN TONES
IF I HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO DECIDE THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITY BETWEEN THE NARRATIVE RELATED BY AMBROSE IN HIS DEFENSE AND THE NARRATIVE RELATED BY SILAS IN HIS CONFESSION I MUST HAVE OWNED NO MATTER HOW UNWILLINGLY THAT THE CONFESSION WAS TO MY MIND THE LEAST INCREDIBLE STORY OF THE TWO
I DECLINE TO PHYSIC YOU
WHAT DO YOU WANT THERE THE MAN STEPPED OUT FROM THE SHADOW INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND STOOD REVEALED TO US AS JOHN JAGO
OH YES
SHE WAS A MELANCHOLY MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE ATTRACTIONS OF ANY SORT--ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO APPEAR TO ACCEPT THE OBLIGATION OF LIVING UNDER PROTEST AS A BURDEN WHICH THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE CONSENTED TO BEAR IF THEY HAD ONLY BEEN CONSULTED FIRST
HE ACCUSED HIS BROTHER AMBROSE OF THE MURDER OF JOHN JAGO
BUT THE DOOR OF THE TOOL-HOUSE ROUND THE CORNER IS NOT LOCKED VERY GOOD
THE STILLNESS IN THE HOUSE WAS BREATHLESS
HALF AN HOUR LATER ONE OF THE WOMEN-SERVANTS HANDED TO ME AN ENVELOPE BEARING MY NAME ON IT IN NAOMI'S HANDWRITING
ARE YOU SURE OF WHAT YOU SAY I INQUIRED
SIT TOGETHER HE CAST ANOTHER DARK LOOK AT HIS SONS
THERE HE STOOD SELF-BETRAYED ALREADY IN THE POPULAR OPINION AS A GUILTY MAN
IN THE BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE MISS MEADOWCROFT REPLIED TO MY QUESTION FROM THE OTHER END OF THE HALL
I REACHED THIS CONCLUSION RELUCTANTLY AND REGRETFULLY FOR NAOMI'S SAKE
HE HAD VISITED ALL THE INNS AND ALL THE PLACES OF BUSINESS RESORT IN NARRABEE
AMBROSE AND SILAS MEADOWCROFT WERE CHARGED BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE WITH THE WILLFUL MURDER OF JOHN JAGO
BUT I OWN JOHN JAGO FRIGHTENED ME
OUR CONVERSATION ON THE DRIVE BEGAN WITH THE SUBJECTS OF AGRICULTURE AND BREEDING
MY BEDROOM CANDLE WAS ON THE SIDE-TABLE
NO NO
YOUR BROTHER MAY BE WANTED LATER
ON HIS RIGHT-HAND SIDE SAT HIS SAD AND SILENT DAUGHTER
TURNING THE CORNER WE MET JOHN JAGO ON HIS WAY TO NARRABEE
THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR
THE MAIN BLAME OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN SILAS AND JOHN THE OTHER DAY LIES AT HIS DOOR AS I THINK
ONLY THINK SHE ADDED SPEAKING MORE TO HERSELF THAN TO ME OF JOHN JAGO FINDING OUT MISS MEADOWCROFT'S NASTY SLY UNDERHAND WAYS IN THE HOUSE
AND SHE WOULDN'T BREAK HER HEART IF THE BOYS WERE NOT LEFT A STICK OR A STONE ON THE FARM WHEN THE FATHER DIES
I SHALL PASS OVER THE MISERY IN THE HOUSE DURING THE INTERVAL OF EXPECTATION
HE HAS BEEN HINTING AT SOMETHING WHICH HE SAYS HAPPENED UNDER YOUR BEDROOM WINDOW THIS MORNING
SHE ACCUSED ME AS SHE ACCUSED NAOMI OF TRYING MEANLY TO INJURE JOHN JAGO IN HER ESTIMATION OUT OF HATRED TOWARD THAT MUCH-INJURED MAN AND SHE SENT TO ME AS SHE HAD SENT TO NAOMI A FORMAL NOTICE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE
THE GENEROUS NATURE OF THE GIRL SPOKE IN HER NEXT WORDS
THE LABORERS WITHDREW NEXT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO BEGIN THE DAY'S WORK
THE WHOLE PROCEEDING RIDICULOUSLY INFORMAL FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW WAS CARRIED ON BY THESE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE WITH AS STERN AND STRICT A SENSE OF DUTY AS IF IT HAD BEEN SANCTIONED BY THE HIGHEST TRIBUNAL IN THE LAND
SUPPOSE WE KNOW NO MORE OF HIM THAN WE KNOW NOW WHEN THE TRIAL BEGINS
AND I THOUGHT YOU NOTICED ME I DID NOTICE YOU DID YOU WONDER WHAT IT MEANT YES I'LL TELL YOU
BY HON
THEY MUST LOOK UP TO YOU
AND THAT THE ONE SAD ASPECT OF THE CASE TO HER MIND WAS THE DEATH OF JOHN JAGO UNPREPARED TO MEET HIS END
WAS THAT WHAT MADE YOU SPEAK TO ME AS YOU SPOKE WHEN WE FOUND YOU AT THE WOOD SHE ASKED
WHEN SUNRISE CAME I WENT OUT AS BEFORE TO BREATHE THE MORNING AIR
HE'S LIKE HIS SONS--ENGLISH BITTER ENGLISH TO THE MARROW OF HIS BONES
SHE BORE THE NEW BLOW BRAVELY
HIS MANNER BECAME RESTLESS
IN HIS LAST MOMENTS HE HAD COMMITTED HIS HELPLESS DAUGHTER TO THE COMPASSIONATE CARE OF HIS WIFE'S RELATIONS AT MORWICK
NO OFFENSE MISTER
UPON THIS I CAST ABOUT ON MY SIDE AND ASKED AT A VENTURE IF I HAD CHOSEN A CONVENIENT TIME FOR MY VISIT THE YOUNG FARMER'S STOLID BROWN FACE INSTANTLY BRIGHTENED
NOT YOUR STYLE HE REPEATED
SHE HAD HER WORKING APRON ON AND SHE WAS INDUSTRIOUSLY BRIGHTENING THE KNIVES FOR THE BREAKFAST-TABLE ON AN OLD-FASHIONED BOARD
MONEY SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
SHE IS SECRETLY AT THE BOTTOM OF HALF THE BAD FEELING AMONG THE MEN
I CAUGHT HER BY THE ARM AND DETAINED HER
IT STARTLED ME TO FIND MY OWN THOUGHT IN A MAN'S MIND SPOKEN FOR ME BY A MAN
BUT I WAS PREPARED FROM THAT MOMENT TO SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JOHN JAGO FOLLOWED BY VERY GRAVE RESULTS
BEING ASKED IN DUE FORM IF THEY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY IN MITIGATION OF THEIR SENTENCE AMBROSE AND SILAS SOLEMNLY DECLARED THEIR INNOCENCE AND PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFESSIONS HAD BEEN WRUNG FROM THEM BY THE HOPE OF ESCAPING THE HANGMAN'S HANDS
I DECLARE I SHOULDN'T KNOW AMBROSE AGAIN HE IS SO CHANGED
PRESSED ON THIS POINT A MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL WITNESSES ADMITTED THAT THEIR EXAMINATION HAD BEEN A HURRIED ONE
AND I FIND IT EXPLAINS MANY THINGS
ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR BREAKFAST NOT JUST YET
HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU AND NEVER BELIEVE A WORD JOHN JAGO SAYS TO YOU ADDED SILAS
HER ONE ANXIETY WAS FOR AMBROSE
I LOOKED WHERE MY COMPANION WAS LOOKING
IT WAS SAID THAT A MAN LIKE JOHN JAGO HAD BEEN SEEN THE PREVIOUS DAY IN A RAILWAY CAR TRAVELING ON THE LINE TO NEW YORK
THAT EVENING A SERVANT WAS SENT ON HORSEBACK TO NARRABEE TO PROCURE THE INSERTION OF THE ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEXT ISSUE OF THE NEWSPAPER
HIS HAPPINESS AND HIS LIFE AND HIS HOPES IN EARTH AND HEAVEN AND LORD ONLY KNOWS WHAT BESIDES ALL DEPENDED HE SAID ON A WORD FROM ME
JOHN JAGO DID THAT SIR WITH A KNIFE BY ACCIDENT I ASKED
THE WORDS POURED OUT FROM HIM LIKE--WELL LIKE NOTHING I CAN THINK OF BUT WATER FROM A PUMP
THERE'S HARDLY A DAY GOES BY THAT HARD WORDS DON'T PASS BETWEEN THE BOYS AND JOHN OR THE BOYS AND THEIR FATHER
I FORGOT MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES AND MY ENGLISH FRIENDS
HE WAS EXPECTED BACK TO SUPPER
I PLUCKED UP SPIRIT ENOUGH AT THAT TO REMIND HIM THAT I WAS PROMISED TO AMBROSE
IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED OF IT SHE SAID COME WITH ME TO THE PRISON TOMORROW
AND I SAID TO MYSELF IF TO BE CURED MEANS IN MY CASE TO BE DULL I HAVE ACCURATELY PICKED OUT THE VERY PLACE FOR THE PURPOSE I LOOK BACK AT THOSE WORDS BY THE LIGHT OF LATER EVENTS
THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THEIR TRIAL WAS THE FIRST DAY IN THE NEW WEEK
MANCHESTER VERMONT JOURNAL BOOK AND JOB OFFICE 1873 IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO ADD FOR THE BENEFIT OF INCREDULOUS READERS THAT ALL THE IMPROBABLE EVENTS IN THE STORY ARE MATTERS OF FACT TAKEN FROM THE PRINTED NARRATIVE
LET ME GO I STILL PERSISTED IN TRYING TO SOOTHE HER
I COME FROM THE CHANNEL ISLAND OF JERSEY
NO ORGANIC DISEASE THAT I CAN DISCOVER
NOBODY WAS AT THE GATE
AND SHE LOOKED AT NAOMI AS ONLY A JEALOUS WOMAN OF MIDDLE AGE CAN LOOK AT A YOUNGER AND PRETTIER WOMAN THAN HERSELF
I BEG TO APOLOGIZE SIR FOR INTRUDING MYSELF ON YOUR CONVERSATION
I AM RIGHT GLAD I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU SIR
AND I NOW RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO TRY WHAT MY INFLUENCE COULD DO TOWARD KEEPING THE PEACE AT MORWICK FARM
MY SONS HAVE THEIR FAULTS HE SAID SERIOUS FAULTS
YOU WANT TO SEE THE FARM MR LEFRANK
AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT CAST ABOUT FOR ANOTHER TOPIC AND FAILED TO FIND IT
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
NAOMI STOPPED HIM BEFORE HE COULD SAY MORE
DO YOU BELIEVE THE REPORT THAT HE WAS SEEN TRAVELING ON THE RAILWAY TO NEW YORK I BELIEVE IT FIRMLY SIR
THERE SHE STOPPED
DO YOU BELIEVE JOHN JAGO IS STILL A LIVING MAN SHE PUT THE QUESTION VEHEMENTLY DESPERATELY AS IF THE WORDS RUSHED OUT OF HER MOUTH IN SPITE OF HER
THERE ARE EYES ON THE WATCH AND EARS ON THE WATCH IN THE HOUSE
I HAVE BEEN LONG IN TELLING YOU OF IT SIR BUT NOW YOU KNOW HOW THE ENVY AND THE HATRED GREW AMONG THE MEN BEFORE MY TIME
I STOPPED HIM WITHOUT CEREMONY
BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME ONE THING FIRST SIR
I UNDERSTOOD OR THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD THE SAD DESPAIR OF HUMANITY WHICH LED MEN INTO MONASTERIES IN THE OLD TIMES
AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT HAD CONFESSED HIMSELF TO BE THE MURDERER OF JOHN JAGO
DURING THIS INTERVAL NO NEW EVENT OF ANY IMPORTANCE OCCURRED
WE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE
THIS STATEMENT WAS NOT NOTICED BY THE BENCH
PEOPLE ARE SUCH LIARS HERE
THERE WAS NO SORT OF NEED FOR MY KEEPING IT ANY LONGER
HE MADE ME ANOTHER DEFERENTIAL BOW AND WITHDREW INTO THE HOUSE
WON'T YOU LET ME COMFORT YOU NOW SHE STILL STRUGGLED TO GET AWAY AND STILL KEPT HER HEAD TURNED FROM ME
LET ME SEE HIM I SAID
I OBTAINED THE ORDER OF ADMISSION TO THE PRISON THE NEXT MORNING
I HAD SO FIRMLY DISBELIEVED THAT JOHN JAGO WAS A LIVING MAN
YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN
THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE MET IN COMMITTEE MADE SPEECHES ELECTED COMPETENT PERSONS TO REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTERESTS AND BEGAN THE SEARCH THE NEXT DAY
IF THE TEXTS MEANT ANYTHING THEY MEANT THAT SHE HAD FORESEEN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
BUT HOW COULD I BE SURE OF THAT
WELL THAT'S WHAT THEY DO SAY JOHN JAGO VOWED
WE MUST FIND THE TRACKS OF JOHN JAGO FOR OURSELVES
BE PLEASED TO UNDERSTAND ONCE FOR ALL MR SILAS THAT NOT SO MUCH AS THE THOUGHT OF MAKING LOVE TO THE YOUNG LADY HAS EVER ENTERED MY HEAD
THAT'S LUCKY SIR WAS ALL SHE SAID
AMBROSE LOOKED AFTER THE CROPS AND SILAS AFTER THE CATTLE
I HATE HIM TOO BADLY FOR THAT
NAOMI AND I AGAIN ATTENDED THE COURT TOGETHER
AND WE POINTED OUT CERTAIN MINOR PARTICULARS IN WHICH THE TWO CONFESSIONS FAILED TO CORROBORATE EACH OTHER
IN HIS STARING EYES FIXED IN VACANT HORROR ON EACH WITNESS WHO APPEARED
WE WERE TO BEGIN BY APPLYING TO THE POLICE TO HELP US TO FIND JOHN JAGO AND WE WERE THEN TO BE GUIDED BY CIRCUMSTANCES
WE MADE THE MOST OF THIS
THE BOYS DO THEIR WORK
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD IT
AND LOOK
MANY A TRUE WORD MR SILAS HE SAYS IS SPOKEN IN JEST
I HAVE HALF A MIND NOT TO KEEP THE APPOINTMENT WHEN TEN O'CLOCK COMES
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE DEAD ALIVE BY WILKIE COLLINS
I HAVE DONE WITH MY LIFE AT THE FARM
I WAS CITED TO APPEAR AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES
A HEALTHY HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW ONE OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER HEALTHY HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOWS SAID HOW D'YE DO MR LEFRANK
YOU AND MR LEFRANK CAME UPON US NAOMI WHILE WE WERE STILL TALKING
IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN I READ THESE LINES
SAD AND SEVERE MISS MEADOWCROFT A LISTENER AND A SPY
IN AMERICA WE DON'T DO THE MEN THE HONOR OF LETTING THEM ALARM US
AND I MUST KEEP MY PROMISE
TO THESE CONCLUSIONS I ARRIVED AFTER MUCH THINKING
MISS MEADOWCROFT SEARCHED THE NEWSPAPERS FOR TIDINGS OF THE LIVING JOHN JAGO IN THE PRIVACY OF HER OWN ROOM
THE LIVES OF AMBROSE AND SILAS WERE OF COURSE NO LONGER IN PERIL SO FAR AS HUMAN JUSTICE WAS CONCERNED
I STEPPED UP AND SNATCHED IT OUT OF HIS HAND
I WAS OBSTINATE
WHY I WAS OUT OF SPIRITS I AM UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
MISS MEADOWCROFT VOLUNTEERED TO SIT UP FOR HIM
MR SILAS I SAID I AM AN INVALID AND I AM GOING OUT FOR A WALK
THE VAPOR OVERPOWERED ME I SUPPOSE
THE NEW FACES
PERHAPS HE IS IN DISGUISE
EXCEPT AMBROSE SHE ADDED OPENING HER HAND AGAIN AND LAYING IT VERY EARNESTLY ON MY ARM
WHY HAD HER ANSWER BROUGHT THE TEARS INTO MY EYES
I ADDED THE DATE AND THE ADDRESS
DON'T BE HARD ON SILAS SIR
ANYWAY IT'S TRUTH THE BOYS THEMSELVES CONFESS THAT WHEN JOHN CAME TO THE FARM HE CAME WITH A FIRST-RATE CHARACTER
AFTER HEARING THE EVIDENCE AND EXAMINING THE CONFESSION OF SILAS MEADOWCROFT THE GRAND JURY FOUND A TRUE BILL AGAINST BOTH THE PRISONERS
I NOW PROPOSE TO STATE THE NATURE OF THE DEFENSE IN THE BRIEFEST OUTLINE ONLY
SUPPER-TIME WAS STILL AN EVENT IN THE FUTURE
THE ANSWER INFORMED US THAT AMBROSE AND SILAS HAD EMIGRATED TO NEW ZEALAND AND THAT MISS MEADOWCROFT WAS ALONE AT MORWICK FARM
WHAT SILAS MEADOWCROFT SAID TO HIS BROTHER OF JOHN JAGO WAS WHAT I MYSELF WAS THINKING OF JOHN JAGO AT THAT VERY MOMENT
THE OLD MAN HAS AN AGGRAVATING WAY MR LEFRANK--A NASTY WAY AS WE DO CALL IT--OF TAKING JOHN JAGO'S PART
THEY RESENTED THE REPROOF WITH NEEDLESS INDIGNATION ON THEIR SIDE AND LEFT THE ROOM
DON'T MAKE ME THE LAUGHING-STOCK OF THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD
NOW THAT HE WAS OUT OF HEARING NAOMI SPOKE TO ME VERY EARNESTLY
I HAD DETERMINED ON NAOMI'S ACCOUNT TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP
THE NEXT DAY MY BRIEFS WENT BACK TO THE ATTORNEYS
COME IN TO PRAYERS SHE SAID
I TRIPPED UP HIS HEELS AT THE SAME MOMENT
AND HE GAVE IT AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING
IF YOU ATTEMPT TO GIVE THE ALARM HE ANSWERED AS TRUE AS GOD'S ABOVE US YOU WILL FEEL MY HAND ON YOUR THROAT
EVEN WHEN HE SPOKE TO MR MEADOWCROFT HE WAS STILL ON HIS GUARD--ON HIS GUARD AGAINST THE TWO YOUNG MEN AS I FANCIED BY THE DIRECTION WHICH HIS EYES TOOK ON THESE OCCASIONS
THE CONFESSIONS WERE ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE
WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE BOYS HE LOOKED ABOUT PRIVATELY I THINK HE WAS WRONG IN THAT SIR
MY GOOD FRIEND ARE YOU AWARE THAT IT IS TERM-TIME
AS SHE PASSED BENEATH HIM NAOMI WAS JUST TALL ENOUGH TO REACH HIS HAND ON TIPTOE
THE SUN WAS SHINING IN BRIGHTLY AT THE WINDOW
AND IF SILAS HADN'T STOPPED ME I THINK IT'S LIKELY I MIGHT HAVE SHIED JOHN JAGO HIMSELF INTO THE LIME NEXT
YOU KNOW MORE THAN THEY KNOW
SEATED APART HE HAD KEPT SILENCE THROUGHOUT ATTENTIVELY WATCHING THE EFFECT OF AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT'S NARRATIVE ON THE OFFICERS OF THE PRISON AND ON ME
I AM HERE TO FETCH YOU SHE ANSWERED IN HER FRANK AND FEARLESS WAY
ON MY RETURN TO THE FARM I DID NOT SEE NAOMI
IT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO SUPPOSE
NOTE IN CONCLUSION.--THE FIRST IDEA OF THIS LITTLE STORY WAS SUGGESTED TO THE AUTHOR BY A PRINTED ACCOUNT OF A TRIAL WHICH ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE EARLY IN THE PRESENT CENTURY IN THE UNITED STATES
IT MEANS A FEAR THAT I HAVE IN MY OWN MIND SHE ANSWERED--"A FEAR MR LEFRANK OF MATTERS TAKING A BAD TURN AMONG THE MEN HERE--THE WICKED HARD-HEARTED UNFEELING MEN
IF YOU FEEL THE SLIGHTEST ALARM I WILL WAIT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN SO THAT I CAN HEAR IF YOU CALL ME SHE RECEIVED MY PROPOSAL WITH A SAUCY TOSS OF THE HEAD AND A SMILE OF PITY FOR MY IGNORANCE
AND DO IT RIGHT AWAY FOR MY SAKE I LET HER RUN ON WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO DISPUTE HER CONCLUSIONS UNTIL SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
AND I HEARD HIM ANSWER ALL RIGHT AMBROSE DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO KEEP A SECRET FROM US ASKED NAOMI APPROACHING HER LOVER WITH A SMILE
IT'S OUR LITTLE AMERICAN COUSIN NAOMI COLEBROOK I VAGUELY REMEMBERED THAT A YOUNGER SISTER OF MR MEADOWCROFT'S HAD MARRIED AN AMERICAN MERCHANT IN THE REMOTE PAST AND HAD DIED MANY YEARS SINCE LEAVING AN ONLY CHILD
THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL HAD ALARMED THE HOUSE
IF NO QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE AT THE LIME-KILN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE READY AS I VIEWED THE CASE TO BELIEVE THAT JOHN JAGO'S DISAPPEARANCE WAS REFERABLE TO THE TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH NAOMI HAD INFLICTED ON HIM
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING OF JOHN JAGO THIS MORNING THE SMOLDERING ILL-TEMPER OF AMBROSE BURST SUDDENLY--WHY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS--INTO A FLAME
THERE HE KNELT AND HELD BY THE SKIRT OF MY GOWN
HE ISN'T THE ONLY CHRISTIAN WHO LEAVES HIS CHRISTIANITY IN THE PEW WHEN HE GOES OUT OF CHURCH
MR MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER BROKEN BY THE SUFFERING WHICH HE HAD GONE THROUGH DIED SUDDENLY OF A RHEUMATIC AFFECTION OF THE HEART
LEFT IN COMPANY WITH MR MEADOWCROFT AND HIS DAUGHTER BOTH DEVOURED BY ANXIETY ABOUT THE MISSING MAN AND BOTH TRYING TO CONCEAL IT UNDER AN ASSUMPTION OF DEVOUT RESIGNATION TO CIRCUMSTANCES I NEED HARDLY ADD THAT I TOO RETIRED AS SOON AS IT WAS POLITELY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM
IS THE DOOR OF THE DAIRY OPEN I ASKED
AND THERE ARE SOME FOOTSTEPS--I WON'T SAY WHOSE--SO SOFT THAT NO PERSON CAN HEAR THEM THE LAST ALLUSION EVIDENTLY MADE ITSELF UNDERSTOOD
I MUSTN'T TELL YOU SHE RESUMED WITH HER HEAD DOWN OVER THE KNIFE
COME SHAKE HANDS ON IT THERE WAS NO RESISTING HER FEARLESS FRANKNESS
NOT ONLY IN THE IMMEDIATE DISTRICT BUT IN THE TOWN OF NARRABEE ITSELF THE PUBLIC VOICE INSISTED ON THE NECESSITY OF A SEARCH FOR THE MORTAL REMAINS OF JOHN JAGO AT MORWICK FARM
THIS DONE THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT FOR NEWS OF AMBROSE AND FOR THE EXAMINATION BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE WHICH WAS TO FOLLOW
IT'S MY TURN NOW MISS
LIKED HER HEARTY SHAKE OF THE HAND WHEN WE WERE PRESENTED TO EACH OTHER
THE MISANTHROPICAL SIDE OF MY NATURE WHERE IS THE SICK MAN WHO IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF THAT SIDE OF HIM WAS FAST GETTING THE UPPER HAND OF ME WHEN I FELT A LIGHT TOUCH LAID ON MY SHOULDER AND FOUND MYSELF RECONCILED TO MY SPECIES ONCE MORE BY NAOMI COLEBROOK
NAOMI CAST AN ANXIOUS GLANCE AT ME AS HE SAT DOWN
WITH STUDIED POLITENESS THE MAN OF THE GLITTERING BROWN EYES WISHED ME A GOOD NIGHT'S REST AND LEFT THE ROOM
YOU HAVE TOLD ME THE SECRET I SAID
MISCHIEF DID COME OF IT
I HAVE PROMISED NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
COULD I SAY THIS TO NAOMI
SHE PUT DOWN THE KNIFE THAT SHE WAS CLEANING AND FOLDED HER HANDS BEFORE HER THINKING
ASK ME WHAT YOU WILL BESIDES AND I'LL DO IT FOR YOU
AFTER BEING LAUGHED AT AND INSULTED AND DENIED I WAS GLAD SAID THE MISERABLE WRETCH TO SEE THAT SOME OF YOU HAD SERIOUS REASON TO WISH ME BACK AGAIN
HE GOT UP FROM MY FEET AND HE SETTLED DOWN QUIET AGAIN ALL ON A SUDDEN
I LOOKED AT THE BROTHERS AS THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE PRESSED MORE AND MORE HEAVILY AGAINST THEM
THE MATERIALS IN THE DEFENSE
I SHIED IT INTO THE QUICKLIME CLOSE BY US AND I PITCHED THE KNIFE AFTER THE CLOTH
NEXT TIME YOU GO COURTING A YOUNG LADY IN SECRET SAID SILAS MAKE SURE THAT THE MOON GOES DOWN FIRST OR WAIT FOR A CLOUDY SKY
MOST MEN WOULD NEVER HAVE NOTICED HER I WAS COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE
WHAT SHALL I DO LET ME SEE HIM AND I WILL TELL YOU WE ENTERED HER ROOM
I FORGOT AMBROSE AND HIS CONFESSION
EXCEPT AT MEAL-TIMES I WAS LEFT DURING THE PERIOD OF WHICH I AM NOW WRITING ALMOST CONSTANTLY ALONE WITH THE CHARMING AMERICAN GIRL
I SAID ALL I COULD SAY TO SHAKE THE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE WHICH SHE FELT IN THE DISCHARGE OF THE PRISONERS AT THE NEXT EXAMINATION
I SET THEM DOWN AS MEN WITH UNDEVELOPED QUALITIES WAITING THE GOOD AND EVIL QUALITIES ALIKE FOR TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES TO BRING THEM TO THEIR FULL GROWTH
A CHARMING GIRL--AN IRRESISTIBLE GIRL
I WENT UPSTAIRS AND KNOCKING SOFTLY AT HER DOOR MADE MY INQUIRIES FROM OUTSIDE
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF JOHN JAGO AND I HAVE GOT MY WORK TO GO ON WITH
I HEARD THEIR VOICES AT THE LIME-KILN
THE ONLY ATTAINABLE TIDINGS OF HIS WHEREABOUTS WERE TIDINGS DERIVED FROM VAGUE REPORT
DON'T YOU THINK SO YOURSELF IF I HAD CONFESSED WHAT I REALLY THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT AMBROSE HAD PROVED NOTHING TO MY MIND EXCEPT THAT HE POSSESSED RARE POWERS OF SELF-CONTROL
ANYBODY CAN SEE THAT AMBROSE IS INNOCENT
HIS EMPLOYER HAD SENT TO HIS LODGINGS AND HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HE HAD SUDDENLY PACKED UP HIS HAND-BAG AFTER READING THE NEWSPAPER AT BREAKFAST
THE OLD FATHER HERE ISN'T EASY TO PLEASE
AMBROSE OWNED AS MUCH TO ME HIMSELF
DON'T SUPPOSE SIR I HAVE ANY SECRETS WITH HIM SHE SAID
I SAW THE TWO SHADOWY FIGURES SLOWLY PACING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN THE MOONLIGHT THE WOMAN A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF THE MAN
I WAS SENT THERE AFTER MY FATHER'S DEATH TO WAIT TILL MISS MEADOWCROFT COULD TAKE ME TO MORWICK WE DECIDED ON TELEGRAPHING TO THE HOTEL
HE HAS HAD ONE WIFE ALREADY
IF I TOUCHED HIM WITH ONE HAND SIR I TELL YOU THIS I SHOULD THROTTLE HIM WITH THE OTHER THAT'S YOUR FEELING TOWARD THE MAN MR SILAS IS IT THAT'S MY FEELING MR LEFRANK
BUT--OH MY
PRAYERS MISS COLEBROOK SHE SAID IN HER SOUREST MANNER
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SIR HE SAID
TO WHAT SORT OF HOUSEHOLD HAD I RASHLY VOYAGED ACROSS THE OCEAN IN SEARCH OF REST AND QUIET
STILL NOT A WORD ABOUT JOHN JAGO SHE SAID
NAOMI MET THE CALAMITY THAT HAD FALLEN ON THE HOUSEHOLD AS RESOLUTELY AS HER UNCLE HIMSELF
AMBROSE WILL SHOW YOU IF YOU GO TO HIM ANSWERED THE OTHER
THE FREEHOLD OF THE FARM WAS BEQUEATHED TO HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE TESTATOR'S RECOMMENDATION ADDED THAT SHE SHOULD MARRY HIS BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND MR JOHN JAGO ARMED WITH THE POWER OF THE WILL THE HEIRESS OF MORWICK SENT AN INSOLENT MESSAGE TO NAOMI REQUESTING HER NO LONGER TO CONSIDER HERSELF ONE OF THE INMATES AT THE FARM
A RELATIVE OF MY MOTHER'S HAD EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES MANY YEARS SINCE AND HAD THRIVEN THERE AS A FARMER
NO NAOMI AND NO ROMANCE THUS FAR
I STEPPED OUT TO ENJOY THE SCENE AND FOUND MY WAY TO A SEAT UNDER AN ELM-TREE
MISS MEADOWCROFT HAD TOLD HER
THE LABORERS ROUSED TO SOME RUDE SENSE OF THE SERIOUS TURN WHICH THE QUARREL WAS TAKING GOT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN AND PARTED THEM
ACTING ON THIS IMPERFECT INFORMATION AMBROSE HAD DECIDED ON VERIFYING THE TRUTH OF THE REPORT BY EXTENDING HIS INQUIRIES TO NEW YORK
THE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS DESCENDING THE STAIRS AFTER VAINLY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF HER ROOM
HERE IS THE PEN ALL READY FOR YOU
I THOUGHT OF TAKING A LITTLE WALK FIRST ALL RIGHT SIR
WE FOUND AMBROSE STILL CONFIDENT OF THE FAVORABLE RESULT FOR HIS BROTHER AND FOR HIMSELF OF THE INQUIRY BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR JOHN JAGO CUT OUT OF A NEWSPAPER AND PASTED INTO A BOOK OF CURIOSITIES KEPT BY A FRIEND
HE LOWERED HIS VOICE
NO SUCH THOUGHT ENTERED OUR HEADS SIR AMBROSE ANSWERED
I FELT AN UNGOVERNABLE CURIOSITY TO KNOW MORE
I SAID I'LL SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR PROMISE IN EXCHANGE FOR MINE
I LEFT IT TO THE MAN OF THE WILD BROWN EYES TO SPEAK FIRST
FORGET ALL ABOUT IT SIR AS SOON AS YOU CAN
GIVE HIM TIME AND HE WILL MAKE HIS EXCUSES AND ALL WILL BE WELL AGAIN MY PRESENTATION OF THE CASE ENTIRELY FAILED TO RE-ASSURE MY PRETTY COMPANION
WE ARE ENGLISH YOU KNOW
WE WILL FOLLOW YOU DIRECTLY MISS MEADOWCROFT SAID NAOMI
PUBLIC OPINION DECLARED ON THIS OCCASION THAT THE LOST MAN WAS THE VICTIM OF FOUL PLAY AND HELD ONE OR BOTH OF THE BROTHERS MEADOWCROFT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DISAPPEARANCE
THE DISMAL PRESENCE OF MISS MEADOWCROFT HAD PASSED OVER MY BEDROOM AND HAD BLIGHTED IT
TAKE IT DOWN GENTLEMEN AND WELCOME AMBROSE REPLIED
I HAVE WATCHED HER AND I KNOW IT
BUT YOU CANNOT DELIBERATELY OVERWORK YOUR BRAIN AND DERANGE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM MUCH LONGER
HE BOWED TO US AND MELTED AWAY INTO THE SHADOW OF THE TREE
I TOOK A SUDDEN RESOLUTION TO GO BACK TO ENGLAND
HER APRON WAS OVER HER FACE AND SHE WAS CRYING BITTERLY
AND HE LEFT IT TO THE JURY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONFESSIONS IN THIS CASE HAD BEEN SO INFLUENCED
I'M OUT OF TEMPER AND I CAN'T WAIT EXCEPT THAT I MADE THE BEST INSTEAD OF THE WORST OF IT I TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNDER MY WINDOW AS PLAINLY AS I HAVE TOLD IT HERE
SOME MONTHS AFTER OUR MARRIAGE MRS LEFRANK WROTE TO A FRIEND AT NARRABEE FOR NEWS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE FARM
FACTS AND DATES ALL MINGLED TOGETHER CONFUSEDLY IN MY MIND
AS TO THE LOWER PART IT WAS COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK BEARD AND MUSTACHE AT A TIME WHEN SHAVING WAS THE RULE AND BEARDS THE RARE EXCEPTION IN AMERICA
RECOVERING THE FIRST SHOOK OF HER SUDDEN APPEARANCE I SAW INSTANTLY IN HER EAGER EYES IN HER DEADLY-PALE CHEEKS THAT SOMETHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED
HE BEGAN ABUSING AMBROSE
NOW I'M SATISFIED AMBROSE WENT ON
HE HAS DONE THIS DESPAIRING OF PROVING HIS INNOCENCE IN TERROR OF THE SCAFFOLD SHE ROSE WITH AN ANGRY STAMP OF HER FOOT
I WAS IN BED SHE SAID BUT NOT ASLEEP WHEN I HEARD A PEBBLE STRIKE AGAINST THE WINDOW-PANE
YOUR STICK WILL BE USEFUL TO ME
I WALKED SOFTLY BY INSTINCT AS I CROSSED THE ROOM TO LOOK OUT AT THE NIGHT
BUT SHE KEPT HER SECRET
AND FOR A REASON SIR WHICH YOU DON'T SUSPECT THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT YOU PAY ME MISS COLEBROOK WHATEVER THE REASON MAY BE SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY REPLY
PLEASE TO EXCUSE ME HIS EYES RESTED WITH A LAST ANXIOUS PLEADING LOOK ON NAOMI'S FACE
WE WERE STILL AT IT WHEN COUSIN NAOMI AND MR LEFRANK CAME UP TO US
CHAPTER V
MR MEADOWCROFT INTERPOSED HIS AUTHORITY
AND I PRONOUNCE THEM AS YOU WILL SOON PRONOUNCE THEM TO BE THE WORDS OF AN ESSENTIALLY RASH MAN WHOSE HASTY JUDGMENT NEVER STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHAT SURPRISES TIME AND CHANCE TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE IN STORE FOR HIM
WHY WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE MR LEFRANK
THE TWO WERE CONFINED IN SEPARATE CELLS AND WERE FORBIDDEN ALL COMMUNICATION WITH EACH OTHER
THE CENTER OBJECT OF THE COLLECTION WAS A LITTLE HEAP OF CHARRED BONES
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF MARRYING FOR THE SECOND TIME
ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WILL COPY IT AND WE SHALL HEAR OF JOHN JAGO BEFORE THE WEEK IS OUT SHE TURNED TO GO AND CAME BACK AGAIN TO ME
PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE AND YOU WILL OWN SIR THAT THE PROSPECT AT HOME WAS NOT A PLEASANT ONE FOR ME IF JOHN JAGO REALLY KEPT AWAY FROM THE FARM AND IF IT CAME OUT THAT IT WAS ALL MY DOING THIS WAS CERTAINLY AN EXPLANATION OF HIS CONDUCT
HER HARD FACE SOFTENED
I SHALL BE AWAY ON FARM BUSINESS TO-MORROW MISS FOR THE WHOLE DAY
WAS THE YOUNG LADY NAOMI COLEBROOK
NAOMI'S HEAD DROPPED ON MY SHOULDER AS HE SAID THE TERRIBLE WORDS WHICH COMMITTED AMBROSE AND SILAS MEADOWCROFT TO TAKE THEIR TRIAL ON THE CHARGE OF MURDER
WE ARRANGED TO APPLY THAT DAY FOR THE ORDER OF ADMISSION TO THE PRISON AND HAVING SEEN AMBROSE TO DEVOTE OURSELVES IMMEDIATELY TO THE CONTEMPLATED SEARCH
MY LIBRARY WAS LIMITED TO THE BIBLE AND THE PRAYER-BOOK
WILL YOU GRATIFY ME BY SAYING SO YOURSELF
I HOPE I AM NOT INTRUDING HE SAID LOOKING HARD AT ME
HER EYES DROPPED TO THE GROUND
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS IF YOU MUST KNOW NAOMI WENT ON WOMAN-LIKE WITH HER QUESTIONING HEEDLESS OF THE RECEPTION WHICH THEY MIGHT MEET WITH FROM AN IRRITATED MAN
HIS COMPLEXION IS EXTREMELY PALE HIS EYES ARE DARK AND VERY BRIGHT AND RESTLESS
WHERE SHALL I FIND SOMEBODY WHO CAN GIVE ME A PLACE I SAW MY WAY TO SAYING THE RIGHT WORD AT THE RIGHT MOMENT
THE LONG PERIOD OF INACTION UNDER THE NAME OF REST TO WHICH THE DOCTOR'S DECISION HAD CONDEMNED ME COULD HARDLY BE MORE PLEASANTLY OCCUPIED AS I THOUGHT THAN BY PAYING A VISIT TO MY RELATION AND SEEING WHAT I COULD OF AMERICA IN THAT WAY
WHY WAS HE SO ANXIOUS THAT NOT A WORD OF IT SHOULD BE HEARD
SINCE HE'S BEEN OVERLOOKER THINGS HAVE PROSPERED AS THEY DIDN'T PROSPER IN THE TIME OF THE BOYS
ON HIS SECOND APPEARANCE AT THE BAR SILAS WAS MORE COMPOSED AND MORE LIKE HIS BROTHER
AMBROSE WILL BE THERE AND I SHALL FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO HIM NEITHER AMBROSE NOR SILAS WAS IN THE BREAKFAST-ROOM WHEN WE ENTERED IT
IF YOU ARE SO MUCH IN EARNEST ABOUT IT MR JOHN I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE
AND WHAT IS MORE I BELIEVE I WAS ON HIS TRACK
DEATH--SHAMEFUL DEATH ON THE SCAFFOLD--MIGHT BE THE TERRIBLE RESULT OF THE CONSULTATION OF THE JURY
GIVE ME YOUR HAND
THE JAILER ON DUTY AT THE OUTER GATE WAS ONE OF NAOMI'S MANY ADMIRERS
SILAS MEADOWCROFT HELD FIRMLY TO THE HORRIBLE CONFESSION THAT HE HAD MADE
AS IT WAS SILAS KEPT HOLD OF ME
SHE TOOK IT
SHE HAD BEEN ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE AT OTHER TIMES
TELL ME RIGHT AWAY SIR
MISS MEADOWCROFT ROSE WITH HER GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY AND GRANTED ME MY DISMISSAL IN THESE WORDS
TIME ENOUGH HAD NOW ELAPSED FOR REPORT TO SPREAD THROUGH THE DISTRICT THE NEWS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AT THE FARM
HAS ANYTHING GONE WRONG
HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES
I WENT INTO COURT THE SAME DAY
SHE SUSPECTED NOTHING SO FAR
SAY HOW DOES IT STRIKE YOU I STILL MADE THE BEST OF A BAD CASE
IT'S ONLY A COPY
ON THE LANDING I MET HER JUST LEAVING HER ROOM
IT IS NEEDLESS TO REPRODUCE IT HERE
NOBODY ANSWERED
IT EXPLAINS JOHN JAGO
IT'S LIKELY WE MAY BE WRONG
AMBROSE MADE ROOM FOR NAOMI TO SIT BETWEEN HIS BROTHER AND HIMSELF
SUPPOSE THE JURY SHE STOPPED SHUDDERING
BLESS YOUR HEART
ON PURPOSE SHE ANSWERED
SILAS TOOK NO NOTICE OF US
MAYBE BECAUSE JOHN DOES CERTAINLY KNOW HIS BUSINESS
SHE TURNED PALE
ASCENDING THE STAIRS ON MY WAY TO MY OWN QUARTERS I DISCOVERED NAOMI HALF HIDDEN BY THE RECESS FORMED BY AN OLD-FASHIONED WINDOW-SEAT ON THE FIRST LANDING
I TRIED TO FIND NAOMI WITHOUT SUCCESS
THE MOONLIGHT MEETING
IF HE EVER LIVES UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH AMBROSE AGAIN I--WELL I BELIEVE I WOULDN'T MARRY AMBROSE IF HE DID
I COULD TELL YOU SUCH THINGS
WE HAVE WAITED FOR NEWS TO COME TO US LONG ENOUGH NAOMI RESUMED
SILAS MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE LABORERS WHO WERE HOLDING HIM
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I EVER DISGRACED MYSELF BY LOVING AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT SHE SHUDDERED AS THE IDEA FOUND ITS WAY TO EXPRESSION ON HER LIPS
AND THE RESTORATION TO AMBROSE ON THE MORNING OF THE FATAL QUARREL OF THE VERY STICK WHICH HAD BEEN FOUND AMONG THE REMAINS OF THE DEAD MAN--THESE FACTS AND EVENTS AND A HOST OF MINOR CIRCUMSTANCES BESIDES SWORN TO BY WITNESSES WHOSE CREDIT WAS UNIMPEACHABLE POINTED WITH TERRIBLE DIRECTNESS TO THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH THE PROSECUTION HAD ARRIVED
I EXCUSED MYSELF FROM ACCEPTING THE CIGAR
THE LIME-KILN
THE BROTHERS HAD GONE AWAY TO THEIR WORK
JOHN JAGO WAS GOING AWAY TO NARRABEE AND SILAS MEADOWCROFT'S SAVAGE TEMPER WAS SUBDUED TO A SULKY REPOSE
I AM SURE YOU MEANT NO HARM MR SILAS
GO AND SMOKE
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMBROSE SHE SAID AND HE HAS BEGGED MY PARDON
I AM GOING TO DO A WRONG THING
ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARD HER OWN DOOR
THE PEBBLE AND THE WINDOW
ALREADY AWARE OF THE BAD FEELING EXISTING BETWEEN THE MEN THE NEIGHBORS HAD BEEN NOW INFORMED NO DOUBT BY THE LABORERS PRESENT OF THE DEPLORABLE SCENE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE UNDER MY BEDROOM WINDOW
BUT NO POSITIVE INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED
I KEPT MY DOUBTS TO MYSELF
WHERE I ASKED
THAT NIGHT SILAS WAS COMMITTED TO PRISON
WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN SHE HAD SOME NEWS FOR ME
THE SENIOR COUNSEL IN THE CASE ON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED APPLIED TO ME FOR SOME INFORMATION WHICH IT WAS MY DUTY TO GIVE HIM
THE INSTINCT OF PROFESSIONAL RETICENCE MADE HIM PAUSE BEFORE HE ANSWERED ME
REST I REPEATED WHEN MY MEDICAL ADVISER HAD DONE
BUT I COULD STILL HEAR HIM
I DON'T WANT TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION
CERTAINLY REPEATED NAOMI
YOU AND I CAN EASILY PUT THINGS RIGHT IN HIS ABSENCE SHE TOOK MY ARM
IS SILAS ORDERED TO HOLD HIS TONGUE AMBROSE KICKED SULKILY AT THE LOOSE STONES LYING ABOUT HIM
IF YOU ARE A GOOD SAILOR TAKE A SEA-VOYAGE
I HAD TIME FOR REFLECTION BEFORE IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO ACT
AMBROSE MADE UP THE STORY THAT WE WERE TO TELL IF WHAT HE HAD DONE WAS FOUND OUT
OUR HOUSE HAS NEVER BEEN SO CHEERFUL AS IT IS NOW HAVE YOU ANY VISITORS STAYING WITH YOU IT'S NOT EXACTLY A VISITOR
WOMEN CAN GET EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATES IF THEY HAVE A FRIEND TO SPEAK FOR THEM
IMMOVABLE DETERMINATION WAS IN HER VOICE
NO SHE SAID
I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER
MEADOWCROFT'S FARM WAS SITUATED FELL WITHIN THIS LATTER CATEGORY
BITTER BITTER BITTER HATE SHE CLINCHED HER LITTLE FISTS
I WILL TELL YOU SHE WHISPERED
HIS DAUGHTER IN STERN INDULGENCE TO NAOMI MERCIFULLY PERMITTED HER OPINION TO GLIMMER ON US ONLY THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF QUOTATION FROM SCRIPTURE TEXTS
I DISPLAYED MY TOTAL IGNORANCE OF CROPS AND CATTLE BEFORE WE HAD TRAVELED TEN YARDS ON OUR JOURNEY
MURDER.--PRINTERS OF NEWSPAPERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ARE DESIRED TO PUBLISH THAT AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT AND SILAS MEADOWCROFT OF MORWICK FARM MORWICK COUNTY ARE COMMITTED FOR TRIAL ON THE CHARGE OF MURDERING JOHN JAGO NOW MISSING FROM THE FARM AND FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THERE ARE SOME OF THE GRANDEST NATURAL PROSPECTS ON THE FACE OF CREATION IN AMERICA
BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING HE IS HIDING SOMETHING FROM ME THE DAY WORE ON
I FORGOT THE COMING TRIAL
I WAS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE IN THE DEVIL MR LEFRANK
AND AT NAOMI'S OWN REQUEST I TOOK THE POOR GIRL INTO COURT AND SAT BY HER DURING THE PROCEEDINGS
IF KEEPING IT WILL HELP TO QUIET HER LET HER KEEP IT BY ALL MEANS
AND WITH THAT I GOT UP ON THE SIDE OF THE KILN AND BEGAN SOUNDING FOR THE KNIFE TO BRING IT YOU KNOW BY MEANS OF THE STICK WITHIN EASY REACH OF A SHOVEL OR SOME SUCH THING
I HAD CAREFULLY PREPARED NAOMI'S MIND FOR THE DECISION OF THE GRAND JURY
I COULDN'T HELP STARTING WHEN I HEARD WHAT SILAS HAD SAID
GOOD-NIGHT FRIEND LEFRANK
OH
BUT THERE'S NO TIME NOW--IT'S CLOSE ON TEN O'CLOCK
WE SAT DOWN ON A FELLED TREE OUTSIDE THE WOOD
THE WOMAN HAVING STILL SOMETHING IN HER MIND TO SAY SAID IT
THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR PRESERVED IMPENETRABLE SILENCE UNTIL THE PRESSURE PUT ON THEM JUDICIALLY AT THE TRIAL OBLIGED THEM TO SPEAK
IN THE PRESENT TEMPER OF THE POPULAR MIND THE ABSENCE OF AMBROSE WAS A SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF
WELL I WILL TRY AND TELL YOU WHAT AMBROSE TOLD ME
A LONG INTERVIEW HAD BEEN HELD BETWEEN MR MEADOWCROFT AND HIS DAUGHTER AND THE OFFICIAL PERSONAGE INTRODUCED BY THE FRIEND
I AM GOING AWAY AS THE DUMB CREATURES GO WHEN THEY ARE SICK TO HIDE MYSELF IN A CORNER AND DIE
THE SALARY IS ANYTHING IN REASON YOU LIKE TO ASK ME FOR
IT WAS PLAIN THAT THE MAN WITH THE BEARD STOOD HIGH IN THE FATHER'S FAVOR AND THAT HE WAS CORDIALLY DISLIKED FOR THAT OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON BY THE SONS
I'LL DO HIM JUSTICE THOUGH I DO HATE HIM
THE NEWSPAPER AT HIS BREAKFAST HAD NO DOUBT GIVEN HIM HIS FIRST INFORMATION OF THE FINDING OF THE GRAND JURY AND OF THE TRIAL TO FOLLOW
THE REMEDY IN YOUR CASE IS--REST SO THE DOCTOR SPOKE IN MY CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE LONDON
WE ARE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE MR LEFRANK
HE'S TOO SWEET ON NAOMI NOT TO COME BACK WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW NAOMI I HAD NOTICED IT TOO
I WILL NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN SHE PUSHED ME FURIOUSLY AWAY FROM HER
IT IS SERIOUS THE SEARCH COMMITTEE CONDUCTED ITS PROCEEDINGS WITH THE STRICTEST REGULARITY
WHAT DO YOU WANT NAOMI REPEATED
I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT WITH MY WINDOW OPEN
HAD PAID HIS RENT HONESTLY AND HAD GONE AWAY NOBODY KNEW WHERE
AND NOBODY KNOWS IT BETTER THAN I DO
SILAS WAS SWINGING A STOUT BEECHEN STICK IN HIS HAND AND WAS SPEAKING TO JAGO COARSELY AND INSOLENTLY ENOUGH OF HIS MOONLIGHT MEETING WITH NAOMI ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
THE MAN RETURNED LATE IN THE EVENING BRINGING STARTLING NEWS TO THE FARM
THE NEXT DAY MADE THE MYSTERY DEEPER THAN EVER
THERE NAOMI SPEAKING BY CHANCE TO ONE OF THE FEMALE SERVANTS MADE CERTAIN DISCOVERIES
I WAITED IN SILENCE FOR THE DISCLOSURE THAT WAS NOW TO COME
IT'S LIKELY ENOUGH HE DIDN'T MEAN TO HARM ME EITHER
I HAVE IT FROM AMBROSE
WE INSISTED ON MAKING BOTH THE PRISONERS PLEAD NOT GUILTY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS TO MY LITTLE FRIEND
MY HEART WAS IN MY MOUTH AND MY KNEES SHOOK UNDER ME
SHE CHANGED COLOR FOR A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A PRETTY RELUCTANT TENDERNESS AS SHE TOOK HER CHAIR
AND I SAY I COULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF THEY WOULD HAVE LET ME STAY IN NEW YORK I LOOKED AT NAOMI
I WON'T WASTE ANY MORE WORDS ON HIM MR LEFRANK TO PLEASE YOU
SHE TOOK UP THE KNIFE ONCE MORE AND WENT ON CLEANING IT AS INDUSTRIOUSLY AS EVER
I LOOKED AT AMBROSE AND SAW THE ANSWER IN HIS FACE
OH SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHAT MADNESS POSSESSED ME
I GOT UP AND RAN TO THE WINDOW TO LOOK OUT
SHE DROPPED ON THE SEAT AND WRUNG HER HANDS ON HER LAP
WE STOPPED WHERE YOU FOUND US AND SAT DOWN ON THE FELLED TREE
JOHN JAGO WAS A LOST MAN
SILAS MEADOWCROFT CAME IN AT THE SAME MOMENT AND WAS PRESENTED TO ME BY HIS BROTHER
SIT DOWN SHE PROCEEDED
WHEN HE SAW ME APPROACHING HIM HE ADVANCED A STEP FROM THE GATE AND MADE AN EFFORT TO EXCUSE HIMSELF WITH A VERY ILL GRACE
HAVING TIME TO SPARE BEFORE THE MAIL WENT OUT HE HAD RETURNED TO THE OFFICE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE MAN BEFORE HE POSTED HIS LETTER
AS FOR SILAS HE WAS PROVED TO HAVE BEEN BESIDE HIMSELF WITH TERROR WHEN HE MADE HIS ABOMINABLE CHARGE AGAINST HIS BROTHER
THINGS DIDN'T GO WELL SOMEHOW UNDER THEIR MANAGEMENT
HE HAD GIVEN ME A GENERAL INVITATION TO VISIT HIM IF I EVER CROSSED THE ATLANTIC
THROUGH THE WAKEFUL HOURS OF THE NIGHT MY MIND DWELT ON HER LAST WORDS
ARE YOU THE PARSON PUTTING ME THROUGH MY CATECHISM
THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM OF THEIR ABSENCE FROM MORNING PRAYERS WITH NEEDLESS SEVERITY AS I THOUGHT
I AM ONLY SURE AMBROSE WAS NOT IN FAULT
MAY I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TOO I SAID
WE WILL HAVE MORE TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN DO TO-MORROW WHEN YOU ARE SHOWN OVER THE FARM
SHE PAUSED AND NOTICED ME STANDING UNDER THE WINDOW
I HAVE SET MY MARK ON YOU ONCE SIR
THE EVENT OF THE NEXT DAY ENLIGHTENED US IN A VERY UNEXPECTED MANNER
I THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF I SAID TO OWN THAT YOU'RE WICKED ENOUGH TO LOVE ME WHEN YOU KNOW I AM PROMISED TO ANOTHER MAN WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM HE TOOK A NEW TURN
YOU ONCE TOLD ME I HAD COMFORTED YOU I SAID TO HER GENTLY
DON'T THINK ILL OF AMBROSE
I DON'T MEAN AMBROSE SIR
I SHOOK HANDS ON IT
I HAD JUST LIGHTED IT
WHO WILL HELP ME TO MAKE INQUIRIES
I WAS THE MORE ANXIOUS OF THE TWO TO KEEP THINGS SECRET BECAUSE I HAD NAOMI TO CONSIDER AS WELL AS THE OLD MAN
DOESN'T HE
SHE CARRIED AN OSTENTATIOUSLY LARGE PRAYER-BOOK
NOT MY STYLE MR SILAS--NOT MY STYLE SOMETHING IN THOSE WORDS OR IN HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING THEM APPEARED TO EXASPERATE SILAS
THERE WAS NO FOREWARNING IN THE APPEARANCE OF AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT OF THE STRANGE AND TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT WERE TO FOLLOW MY ARRIVAL AT MORWICK
AND I AM NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH
SHE HAD EVIDENTLY JUST RISEN IN FEAR AND IN HASTE FROM HER BED
IT ENDED IN OUR AGREEING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND TO KEEP OUR OWN COUNSEL IN THE MEANTIME
YOU ARE A LAWYER AIN'T YOU SHE ASKED
MISS MEADOWCROFT WAS THE LAST PERSON IN THE HOUSE TO SPARE THE POOR GIRL
COME AND HELP ME TO FIND THE BOYS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WE VISITED ONE PART OF THE FARM AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT DISCOVERING THE MISSING MEN
HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE WERE SHAVED OFF
SILAS ROSE AS WE APPROACHED AND WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF GREETING OR APOLOGY INTO THE WOOD
AND HE SPOKE OUT ON HIS SIDE AS FREELY AS I DID
NAOMI COLEBROOK WAS STANDING AT ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS OF THE FARM
STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS WITH ME AND FORGET AND FORGIVE MR JOHN HE GAVE ME HIS PROMISE HE CAN REFUSE ME NOTHING
ON OUR WAY UP THE STAIRS SHE TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ON NAOMI'S WITHDRAWAL TO HER OWN ROOM WE WERE LEFT TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES
YES THAT'S SO
EXCEPTING THE ORDINARY GREETINGS AT MORNING AND NIGHT MISS MEADOWCROFT HAD NOT SAID ONE WORD TO ME SINCE THE TIME WHEN I HAD TOLD HER THAT I DID NOT BELIEVE JOHN JAGO TO BE A LIVING MAN
NAOMI EYED HER A LITTLE MALICIOUSLY I MUST OWN AS THE TWO WOMEN PARTED FOR THE NIGHT
WHAT I WAS SAYING TO MISS NAOMI DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU
SHE LOOKED AT HER FATHER
I BORE WITH YOUR BRUTISH COUSINS HATRED OF ME
HIS ONLY UNMARRIED DAUGHTER HE HAD LONG SINCE BEEN LEFT A WIDOWER WAS IN THE ROOM IN ATTENDANCE ON HER FATHER
IN TELLING ME HOW SILAS ALSO TOLD ME OF THE WORDS THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND JOHN JAGO UNDER MR LEFRANK'S WINDOW
MR MEADOWCROFT DON'T LIKE MY COUNTRYMEN IN GENERAL
THE OFFICE IS BY MY FIRESIDE I SAID
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
I TURNED ROUND AND DISCOVERED AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT
JUST AS I GOT OUT OF BED I HEARD FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES UNDER MY WINDOW
WELL WHERE IS IT TO BE SHE ASKED RESIGNEDLY
YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN
WILL THE GARDEN DO MR JOHN THANK YOU KINDLY MISS
THE CHIEF-JUSTICE SUMMED UP
THE MASS OF THE STRANGERS PRESENT STOOD CONGREGATED ROUND A TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THEY DREW ASIDE AS I APPROACHED WITH NAOMI AND ALLOWED US TO HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF CERTAIN OBJECTS PLACED ON THE TABLE
SHE PRONOUNCED THOSE WORDS AS IF SUPPER WAS A FORM OF DOMESTIC OFFENSE HABITUALLY COMMITTED BY THE MEN AND ENDURED BY THE WOMEN
TOOK HER PLACE AS ONE OF THE FAMILY DIRECTLY
I TRIED HONESTLY TRIED TO PUT THE CONFESSION BEFORE HER IN ITS LEAST UNFAVORABLE LIGHT
ALL I KNOW IS I TURNED GIDDY AND DROPPED THE STICK IN THE KILN
I HAD EVIDENTLY HIT HAP-HAZARD ON AN INTERESTING SUBJECT
THE FIRST WORDS WHICH I CAUGHT DISTINCTLY RELATED TO HIS MOTIVE FOR SECRETLY LEAVING THE FARM
I MECHANICALLY FOLLOWED THE PATH IN THE DIRECTION WHICH SILAS HAD TAKEN BEFORE ME
PROMISE YOU WILL MARRY ME HE SAID AND I WILL GO BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE TO-MORROW AND SHOW HIM THAT I AM A LIVING MAN SUPPOSE I REFUSE IN THAT CASE YOU WILL LOSE ME AGAIN AND NONE OF YOU WILL FIND ME TILL AMBROSE IS HANGED ARE YOU VILLAIN ENOUGH JOHN JAGO TO MEAN WHAT YOU SAY ASKED THE GIRL RAISING HER VOICE
BUT IT WAS WORSE THAN BRUTAL IN JOHN SIR TO OUT WITH HIS KNIFE AND TRY TO STAB SILAS
YOU COULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN A BETTER TIME HE SAID
AS SHE CROSSED THE ROOM TO THE DOOR I SAW HER LOOK UPWARD
THE MISERABLE WRETCH SHOOK AND SHUDDERED DUMBLY LIKE A COWED DOG
IT IS TO THIS DAY A TRIAL TO MY FATHER TO HEAR HIS SON DESCRIBED AS A MEMBER OF THE ENGLISH BAR
TAKE HER INTO THE NEXT ROOM MISTER HE SAID AND LET HER SEE FOR HERSELF WE WENT TOGETHER INTO THE NEXT ROOM
IN THE TERRIBLE TURN WHICH MATTERS HAD NOW TAKEN MR MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER DISPLAYED A SPIRIT AND AN ENERGY FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED
EVERYBODY DECLARED THAT JOHN JAGO HAD NOT ENTERED THE TOWN
NINE O'CLOCK
I NOTICED WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT HIS FAVORITE STICK WAS NOT IN HIS HAND AND WAS NOT LYING NEAR HIM
AFTER WE HAD TAKEN A FEW TURNS ON THE GRAVEL-WALK HE SUDDENLY BROKE OUT LIKE A MAN BESIDE HIMSELF
PAUSING TO ACCUSTOM MY EYES TO THE OBSCURITY INDOORS I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LAWYER WHOM WE HAD EMPLOYED FOR THE DEFENSE SPEAKING TO SOME ONE VERY EARNESTLY
I WAS DETERMINED TO SEE HER
WE SHOWED PLAINLY AND AFTER INVESTIGATION PROVED THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE BELIEVED ON HIS OATH
JAGO IS ABOUT FIVE FEET FOUR INCHES HIGH
THE DOOR OPENED ONCE MORE
GOOD EVENING SAYING THESE LAST WORDS THE LAWYER APPROACHED ME ON HIS WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE
THE KNIFE WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE LABORERS AS THE WEAPON JOHN JAGO HABITUALLY CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM--THE WEAPON WITH WHICH HE HAD WOUNDED SILAS MEADOWCROFT'S HAND
YOU CAN'T THINK HOW STRANGE IT FEELS MR LEFRANK TO BE OUT WITHOUT ONE'S STICK HE SAID
NO REASON BEING ASSIGNED BY THE PERSONS IN AUTHORITY FOR TAKING THIS COURSE
WE TWO TOGETHER KEPT HIM ON THE GROUND UNTIL HELP ARRIVED
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HAVE COMFORTED ME SHE SAID IN HER FRANK WARM-HEARTED WAY WHEN WE PARTED FOR THE NIGHT
I RETRACED MY STEPS TO THE STABLE-YARD
THE QUESTION OF TIME WAS NOW A SERIOUS QUESTION AT MORWICK FARM
C
AFTER A BRIEF SOJOURN AT NEW YORK I STARTED BY RAILWAY FOR THE RESIDENCE OF MY HOST--MR ISAAC MEADOWCROFT OF MORWICK FARM
HE HAS GOT MY PROMISE TO MEET HIM AS YOU SAY
MR MEADOWCROFT WAS UNABLE ON THIS OCCASION TO LEAVE THE HOUSE
WHAT WAS HE SAYING TO HER
DO SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY
I WOULD HAVE WRITTEN FIFTY ADVERTISEMENTS INQUIRING FOR JOHN JAGO RATHER THAN SAY IT
THE FACE WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS BESIDES THIS A STRIKING FACE TO SEE
MISS MEADOWCROFT SLOWLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND FROWNED AT ME
IT HAS HAPPENED NOW THE TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE WOULD HAVE WARNED ANY MAN TO LET HIM ALONE
IN PROOF OF THIS LATTER ASSERTION THE KNIFE WHICH THE DECEASED HABITUALLY CARRIED ABOUT HIM AND THE METAL BUTTONS WHICH WERE KNOWN TO BELONG TO HIS COAT WERE PRODUCED
THE PERSONS BENEATH ME WERE SILAS MEADOWCROFT JOHN JAGO AND THREE STRANGERS WHOSE DRESS AND APPEARANCE INDICATED PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT THEY WERE LABORERS ON THE FARM
HIS HAIR WAS CLOSE CUT
IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT I PICKED UP THE STICK OFF THE GROUND
WHEN YOU ARE QUITE AT LEISURE MISS NAOMI YOU WOULD BE DOING ME A FAVOR IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO YOU IN PRIVATE HE SPOKE WITH THE MOST SCRUPULOUS POLITENESS
THE NEWS FROM NARRABEE
I'M UPSET BY ALL THIS MISERY THOUGH I MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT
FOR MY PART I DID THE LITTLE I COULD TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL
AMBROSE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT MY CURIOSITY WAS POWERFULLY EXCITED
THIS ON MY OATH IS A TRUE CONFESSION
A VAGUE DISTRUST OF THAT MOONLIGHT MEETING STEALTHILY TOOK A HOLD ON MY MIND
I AM RIGHT GLAD YOU HAVE COME HERE MR LEFRANK
AND TAKE CARE YOU DON'T MEET AMBROSE ON THE WAY TAKE YOU CARE YOU DON'T FEEL MY KNIFE AGAIN BEFORE I GO CRIED THE OTHER MAN
THE PRISONERS WERE REMANDED FOR THREE DAYS
THE LAMP WAS NOT YET LIGHTED IN THE HALL
I HANDED THE STICK BACK TO AMBROSE
HIS DAUGHTER WAS PRESENT WALKING TO THE COURT BY HERSELF AND OCCUPYING A SEAT BY HERSELF
I MERELY ADD THIS TO SATISFY YOU THAT I TELL THE TRUTH
COME HERE SHE SAID
NO USEFUL PURPOSE COULD BE SERVED BY DESCRIBING IT NOW
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHEER CRUELTY TO DECEIVE HER NOW
PUBLIC OPINION DECLARES ITSELF IN AMERICA WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST RESERVE OR THE SLIGHTEST CARE FOR CONSEQUENCES
YOU HAVE SAID ENOUGH THAT WAS HOW HE ANSWERED ME YOU HAVE BROKEN MY LIFE
I DIVERTED HER MIND FROM THE QUESTION OF HER LOVER'S INNOCENCE BY PROPOSING THAT WE SHOULD GET THE NECESSARY ORDER AND VISIT HIM IN HIS PRISON ON THE NEXT DAY
I FOLLOWED THE GROOM UP TO MY ROOM NOT OVER-WELL PLEASED WITH MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE FARM
CRUEL INDIFFERENCE TO THE INJURY AND THE SUFFERING WHICH HIS SUDDEN ABSENCE MIGHT INFLICT ON OTHERS WAS PLAINLY IMPLIED IN HIS SECRET WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FARM
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SIR SHE SAID WITH THE MOST PERFECT COMPOSURE
I WAITED IN THE FIRM PERSUASION THAT THE UNSPOKEN QUESTION IN HER MIND WOULD SOONER OR LATER FORCE ITS WAY TO UTTERANCE BY HER LIPS
WE ALL LOOKED AT EACH OTHER EXCEPTING THE TWO BROTHERS WHO WERE SEATED TOGETHER IN A DARK CORNER OF THE ROOM
I LIKED NAOMI COLEBROOK AT FIRST SIGHT
BUT THEY HAVE NO VOICE IN IT WHEN JOHN AND THE OLD MAN PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER OVER THE BUSINESS OF THE FARM
GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR
HAVING BEEN SENT FOR TO SEE ME ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER I HAD ALARMED MY CLERK BY FAINTING AT MY DESK
EARLY THAT MORNING THE SHERIFF HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO MORWICK BY AN OLD FRIEND OF THE MEADOWCROFTS
NOTHING ABOUT THE IMPENETRABLE WOMAN BETRAYED THAT SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING THROUGH THE NIGHT
THE LAWYER WAS ABLE TO ANSWER ME
FOR GOD'S SAKE READ THE LETTER I SEND TO YOU AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY I LOOKED AT THE LETTER
MR MEADOWCROFT'S ELDEST SON AMBROSE WAS WAITING AT THE STATION TO DRIVE ME TO THE FARM
MY FIRST NIGHT AT MORWICK FARM WAS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE
AS TO THE UPPER PART OF THE FACE IT WAS IRRADIATED BY A PAIR OF WILD GLITTERING BROWN EYES THE EXPRESSION OF WHICH SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT WITH THE MAN'S MENTAL BALANCE
I HAD CHOSEN THE VOYAGE TO AMERICA IN PREFERENCE TO ANY OTHER TRIP BY SEA WITH A SPECIAL OBJECT IN VIEW
LEONARD SARGEANT EX-LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF VERMONT
I HAVE NO WISH TO INTRUDE MYSELF NEEDLESSLY ON THE READER'S ATTENTION
SHE STARTED AND TURNED PALE WHEN AMBROSE REPEATED TO HER WHAT SILAS HAD SAID TO HIM
IT ASSUMED TO BE WRITTEN BY A GENTLEMAN IN NEW YORK
I BURST OPEN THE DOOR AND SEIZED HIM AS HE LIFTED HIS HAND ON HER
OH YES YOU WERE
I LOOKED AT MY WATCH
IMMOVABLE DETERMINATION WAS IN HER EYE
NECESSARILY NO WITNESSES COULD BE CALLED ON OUR SIDE
THIS CHANGE DID NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT
SOMEBODY MUST FIND JOHN HE SAID
TO OUTWARD VIEW AT LEAST AMBROSE STILL MAINTAINED HIS SELF-POSSESSION
HOWEVER IT WOULDN'T BE CIVIL I SUPPOSE TO SAY NO IN MY PLACE
I SEE COWARDLY FALSEHOOD AND COWARDLY CRUELTY IN EVERY LINE ON THAT PAPER
IT WOULD BE A KINDNESS ON YOUR PART--A VERY VERY GREAT KINDNESS--IF YOU WILL LET ME SAY IT BEFORE I REST TO-NIGHT I ROSE AGAIN TO RESIGN MY PLACE TO HIM
I QUITE LONGED TO SEE A LITTLE DUST SOMEWHERE
THE NARRATIVE RELATED BY AMBROSE HAD ALL THE APPEARANCE IN MY EYES OF A FABRICATED STORY GOT UP AND CLUMSILY GOT UP TO PERVERT THE PLAIN MEANING OF THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PRODUCED BY THE PROSECUTION
BOSH SAYS SILAS
BEFORE NIGHT THE CRY WAS GENERAL FOR A VERIFICATION OF THE PREACHER'S DREAM
YOU KNOW IT'S MY BUSINESS TO WIND UP THE HALL-CLOCK AT TEN EVERY NIGHT
SHE MET ME EAGERLY
DON'T DESPISE ME MR LEFRANK SHE SAID FAINTLY
MY ROOM WAS CLEAN--OPPRESSIVELY CLEAN
FOR THE REST OUR DEFENSE ON THIS OCCASION WAS AS TO ESSENTIALS WHAT OUR DEFENSE HAD BEEN AT THE INQUIRY BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE
WHAT IS IT I ASKED ADVANCING TO MEET HER
RUDE BRUTE
THE MAGISTRATE'S DECISION HAD EVIDENTLY DAUNTED HIM
IF NOT MAY I OFFER YOU A CIGAR--PROVIDED THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WILL PERMIT IT SO PICKING HIS WORDS WITH PAINFUL DELIBERATION AND POINTING HIS REFERENCE TO THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WITH ONE SARDONIC SIDE-LOOK AT THEM MR JOHN JAGO PERFORMED THE DUTIES OF HOSPITALITY ON HIS SIDE
THE SICK MAN
KEEPING CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND THE WINDOW-CURTAIN I LOOKED OUT
I CALLED ALTERNATELY TO SILAS AND TO AMBROSE
SILAS FIXED HIS EYES ON ME WITH A STARE OF ANGRY SURPRISE
AND TO SOME EXTENT WE WON THE VICTORY
NOT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT WAS CAST ON THE ASSERTION OF THE PROSECUTION THAT HIS BODY HAD BEEN DESTROYED IN THE KILN
FURTHER INQUIRIES HAD POSITIVELY PROVED THAT THE MISSING MAN HAD NEVER BEEN NEAR NARRABEE
WE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AMBROSE GRUFFLY REPLIED AND WE WERE TOO FAR FROM THE HOUSE VERY ODD SAID NAOMI
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT SHE SAID
IS IT SERIOUS NAOMI WHISPERED TO ME AS WE DREW BACK FROM THE TABLE
REMEMBER WHAT JOHN JAGO HAS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF MY BROTHERS SHE PERSISTED
BUT THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT
HE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF GRAVELY ON CROSS-EXAMINATION
I HAD NO IDEA MR LEFRANK THAT WE WERE DISTURBING YOU HE SAID
I GUESS YOU MAY DO SOME GOOD SIR IN THIS WRETCHED HOUSE THE GIRL WENT ON WITH HER EYES STILL EARNESTLY FIXED ON MY FACE
THAT'S THE WORD MR LEFRANK--HATE
THE AUTHORITIES OF THE PRISON--PRESENT OF COURSE AT THE INTERVIEW--WARNED HIM TO REMEMBER THAT WHAT HE SAID MIGHT BE TAKEN DOWN IN WRITING AND PRODUCED AGAINST HIM IN COURT
BUT WARNINGS WHICH SPEAK BY IMPLICATION ONLY ARE THROWN AWAY ON WOMEN
THE PART OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH M
BE OFF WITH YOU ON YOUR BUSINESS YOU COWARDLY HOUND I HEARD SILAS SAY
I DECLARE I ALMOST HATED JOHN JAGO TOO AS WE CROSSED EACH OTHER IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREE
I WAS NOW FURTHER INFORMED THAT THE FATHER ALSO WAS DEAD
IF THINGS GO WELL I MEAN TO MARRY AMBROSE IF THINGS GO WELL I REPEATED
AND HE SAID GOOD-BY FOREVER AND I PITIED HIM
LAST TIME YOU ONLY FELT MY FIST HE SHOUTED NEXT TIME YOU SHALL FEEL THIS HE LIFTED THE STICK AS HE SPOKE
HIS BROTHER SILAS HAD DROPPED IN ABJECT TERROR ON THE JAILER'S CHAIR
THIS DONE WE TOOK AN OBJECTION TO THE LEGALITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT STARTING
I WON'T DISTRESS YOU WHEN WE MEET AGAIN I DESCENDED THE STAIRS FEELING MY FIRST SUSPICION OF THE TRUE NATURE OF MY INTEREST IN THE AMERICAN GIRL
HER MANNER TOWARD ME STEADILY REMAINED THE MANNER OF A SISTER
ON THIS SIDE OF IT AS WE LOOK FROM UNDER THIS TREE THEY RAISE CROPS
THE SAME CRUEL INDIFFERENCE PUSHED TO A FURTHER EXTREME MIGHT WELL LEAD HIM TO PRESS HIS PROPOSALS PRIVATELY ON NAOMI AND TO FIX HER ACCEPTANCE OF THEM AS THE PRICE TO BE PAID FOR SAVING HER COUSIN'S LIFE
I MAKE IT OF MY OWN FREE-WILL REPENTING ME SINCERELY THAT I DID NOT MAKE IT BEFORE SIGNED SILAS MEADOWCROFT I LAID DOWN THE PAPER AND LOOKED AT NAOMI ONCE MORE
I ASK FOR IT
I COULD DETECT NOTHING IN HER BEARING WHICH SUGGESTED ANY COMPASSIONATE FEELING FOR THE PRISONERS IN HER STERN AND SECRET NATURE
AMBROSE THREATENED TO KILL ME NEXT IF I SAID A WORD TO ANY LIVING SOUL
GIVE US YOUR HAND I SAYS TO SILAS
NOW YOU MAY GO ON SAID NAOMI
THE DARK FIGURE OF A MAN WAS STANDING WATCHING US IN THE SHADOW OF THE ELM-TREE
ASSUMING THE LETTER TO BE GENUINE AND ADOPTING NAOMI'S EXPLANATION OF THE MOTIVE WHICH HAD LED JOHN JAGO TO ABSENT HIMSELF SECRETLY FROM THE FARM I REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SEARCH FOR HIM MIGHT BE USEFULLY LIMITED TO NARRABEE AND TO THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD
THE PRISONERS WERE BOTH SENTENCED TO DEATH
AND THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE BONES MIGHT YET PROVE TO BE THE REMAINS OF AN ANIMAL AND NOT OF A MAN
THE SHERIFF AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON WERE THEN SPEAKING PRIVATELY WITH AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT IN HIS CELL
SO FAR I WAS SURPRISED BUT NOT FRIGHTENED
IS IT NOT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A SUDDEN RESOLUTION TO LEAVE THE FARM I REPLIED AS PLAINLY AS BEFORE IT IS NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE SHE STOOD LOOKING AT ME FOR A MOMENT WITH A FACE OF BLANK DESPAIR
NAOMI RECOVERED HER SELF-POSSESSION AND CHECKED ME BEFORE I COULD INTERFERE
OUR PATIENCE WAS NOT SEVERELY TRIED
NOT IF THERE WASN'T ANOTHER MAN LEFT IN THE WORLD TO ASK ME
BY WAY OF MAKING MY FIRST EVENING AT THE FARM ALL THE MORE EMBARRASSING TO ME AS A STRANGER I DISCOVERED BEFORE LONG THAT THE FATHER AND SONS WERE TALKING INDIRECTLY AT EACH OTHER THROUGH MR JAGO AND THROUGH ME
YES THAT IS SO
HE KISSED MY GOWN HE KISSED MY FEET
STOPPED AND CAME BACK TO ME
SILAS GAVE ME NO FURTHER OPPORTUNITY OF REMONSTRATING WITH HIM EVEN IF I HAD BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
ANOTHER PEBBLE WAS THROWN AGAINST THE GLASS
HIS RESOLUTION HAS GIVEN WAY I SAID
IF I HADN'T HAD HOLD OF YOU JOHN JAGO'S KNIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF YOU AFTER ALL HE LED ME AWAY BY THE ARM AND WE WENT ON TOGETHER ON THE ROAD TO THE WOOD
AND THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST IF HE DID CONFESS TO HAVE HIS SENTENCE COMMUTED TO IMPRISONMENT FOR LIFE
HE WAS DEAD
WE HAD VAINLY TRUSTED TO THE EVIDENCE ON THESE TWO POINTS TO INDUCE THE COURT TO REJECT THE CONFESSIONS
IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF TIME HE WENT ON
AND I MUST MAKE MY OWN LIVING IN MY OWN COUNTRY
MISS MEADOWCROFT WOULD MAKE THE HARD TIDINGS DOUBLY TERRIBLE TO BEAR IN THE TELLING
A WOMAN IN MY PLACE IS ONLY A WOMAN
YOU WERE SEEN IN THE GARDEN MASTER JAGO
AFTER MR LEFRANK LEFT US THAT MORNING I ASKED SILAS HOW HE CAME BY MY STICK
A YOUNG LADY QUIETLY JOINED THE PARTY AT THE SUPPER-TABLE
OR IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT I CAN DO IN THE TOWN I THANKED HIM AND DECLINED BOTH PROPOSALS
YES HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE IN YOUR PROFESSION TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE DO YOU THINK SHE STOPPED ABRUPTLY
NOTHING IS THE MATTER NAOMI ANSWERED
NAOMI COLEBROOK IS MEAT FOR YOUR MASTER JOHN JAGO'S TEMPER BEGAN TO GIVE WAY AT LAST
AND I STILL PERSISTED IN TAKING THAT COURSE
HE CHARGED IN RELATION TO THE CONFESSIONS THAT NO WEIGHT SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO A CONFESSION INCITED BY HOPE OR FEAR
MY SPIRITS SANK AS I LOOKED ROUND ME
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE STATE OF MY OWN FEELINGS AT THE TIME
NOT A CURL OF HER STIFF GRAY HAIR WAS DISARRANGED
THAT WILL DO THAT'S SPEAKING OUT SHE SAID
OLD AS SHE IS MR LEFRANK AND UGLY AS SHE IS SHE WOULDN'T OBJECT IF SHE COULD ONLY MAKE HIM ASK HER TO BE JOHN JAGO'S SECOND WIFE
AND THE PLACE NAOMI IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO IT IS THE PLACE OF MY WIFE I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY EXCEPT THAT YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE I SPOKE THOSE WORDS AND THAT I AM AS FOND OF NAOMI AS EVER
I APPLIED AS USUAL FOR THE ORDER OF ADMISSION TO THE PRISON AND THE ORDER WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME REFUSED
THERE IS ALSO TO BE FOUND IN CERTAIN STATES OF THE UNION BY WAY OF WHOLESOME CONTRAST SCENERY AS FLAT AS MONOTONOUS AND AS UNINTERESTING TO THE TRAVELER AS ANY THAT THE EARTH CAN SHOW
I GAVE HIM MY SACRED PROMISE WITH THE TEARS IN MY EYES
IF YOU CHOOSE TO COME AND HELP ME THE CHANCES ARE THAT WE SHALL HAVE THE HALL TO OURSELVES
YOU HEAR HIM BOYS
I BELIEVE IT TOO SHE SAID
WHAT WILL MY UNCLE DO IF YOU GO AWAY
SHE STRUCK UP HIS PISTOL AS HE PULLED IT OUT OF HIS POCKET WITH HIS FREE HAND AND PRESENTED IT AT MY HEAD
JOHN JAGO SHE WHISPERED
I PUT MY HAND ON HIS HEART
I AM ASHAMED OF BOTH OF YOU SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST
ADVERTISE FOR HIM FRIEND LEFRANK
MY HOST ALSO WAS PRESENT IN HIS INVALID-CHAIR WITH HIS DAUGHTER BY HIS SIDE
WE HAVE GOT SILAS ALREADY AND WE WANT AMBROSE TOO ON SUSPICION OF MURDER IT'S A LIE CRIED NAOMI FURIOUSLY--"A WICKED LIE THE MAN TURNED TO ME
IF I GET ON WELL WITH NOBODY ELSE IN THIS HOUSE I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I SHALL CERTAINLY GET ON WELL WITH YOU FOR ONCE IN A WAY I PROVED A TRUE PROPHET
NAOMI RECOGNIZED HIM AS ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
YES I WHISPERED BACK
I WAS WRITING THE MESSAGE AND NAOMI WAS LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER WHEN WE WERE STARTLED BY A STRANGE VOICE SPEAKING CLOSE BEHIND US
MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS LIKE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION NO DOUBT
THERE SHE LEFT ME
LUNGS ALL RIGHT
I DETERMINED TO TRY THE REVIVING INFLUENCE OF A STROLL IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR
CHAPTER III
A LOVELY MOONLIGHT MET MY VIEW
CATTLE AND CROPS JOHN KNOWS HIS BUSINESS
NO MAN THAT I CAN CALL TO MIND EVER REALLY SCARED ME BEFORE
I HAVE SEEN JOHN JAGO SHE SAID
AMBROSE AND SILAS BOTH APPROACHED ME HOSPITABLY WITH THEIR OPEN CIGAR-CASES IN THEIR HANDS
WILL YOU HAVE ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND--YES OR NO NO SHE ANSWERED LOUDLY AND FIRMLY
ANY PERSON WHO CAN GIVE INFORMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF SAID JAGO MAY SAVE THE LIVES OF TWO WRONGLY-ACCUSED MEN BY MAKING IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
IT REQUIRED NO GREAT GIFT OF PENETRATION TO DISCOVER THE IMPRESSION WHICH THE AMERICAN COUSIN HAD PRODUCED IN THIS CASE
AMBROSE TO PREPARE FOR HIS JOURNEY SILAS TO SADDLE ONE OF THE HORSES FOR HIM
THE END OF IT
BUT DON'T ASK ME TO SHAKE HANDS WITH JOHN JAGO
BE OFF WITH YOU TO THE TOWN
AMBROSE MADE A FRIENDLY SIGN OF RECOGNITION AND THEN RESTED HIS HAND ON THE BAR IN FRONT OF HIM
I AM ONLY TELLING THE TRUTH WITH THAT HE TURNED TO NAOMI AND BEGAN HIS NARRATIVE AS NEARLY AS I CAN REMEMBER IN THESE WORDS
WILL THAT DO NOT IN THE HALL MISS IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME NOT IN THE HALL AND NOT IN THE HOUSE EITHER IF I MAY MAKE SO BOLD WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE TURNED IMPATIENTLY AND APPEALED TO ME
AND STILL THE BROTHERS WERE ABSENT
I SAY THE REST OF THEM WANT SOMEBODY HERE TO MAKE THEM ASHAMED OF THEIR HARD HEARTS AND THEIR HORRID FALSE ENVIOUS WAYS
I SPEAK AS A MAN AND I KNOW IT
THEY KNOW THE REST
SHE SHOOK THEM VEHEMENTLY BY WAY OF ADDING EMPHASIS TO HER LAST WORDS
AND ALL THE PAPERS HAVE COPIED THE ADVERTISEMENT
NO NEW WITNESSES WERE CALLED BY THE PROSECUTION
HOW THAT SEARCH WAS TO BE CONDUCTED WAS MORE THAN I COULD TELL AND MORE THAN NAOMI COULD TELL
AS THE DAY APPOINTED FOR THE OPENING OF THE COURT APPROACHED HE SEEMED TO FALTER A LITTLE IN HIS RESOLUTION
A LIFE INCOME ONLY WAS LEFT TO MR MEADOWCROFT'S SONS
MY FATHER WAS A LITTLE DOUBTFUL BEFORE SHE CAME HERE HOW HIS AMERICAN NIECE WOULD TURN OUT
I'M NOT BADLY OFF FOR COURAGE SIR CONSIDERING I'M A WOMAN
NO I INSIST ON IT AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN JUSTICE TO MY FAMILY AND MY NAME THE NEIGHBORS TOOK HIM AT HIS WORD
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE SINCE I HAVE BEEN AT THE FARM WELL LIVE AND LEARN
INQUIRE AS I MIGHT THE ONLY ANSWER GIVEN WAS NOT TO-DAY AT NAOMI'S SUGGESTION WE WENT TO THE PRISON TO SEEK THE EXPLANATION WHICH WAS REFUSED TO US AT THE OFFICE
IT WAS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT HE SHOULD VENTURE BACK TO NARRABEE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIS INFATUATION FOR NAOMI
PRAYERS MR LEFRANK SHE ADDED WITH A LOOK OF DEVOUT PITY DIRECTED EXCLUSIVELY TO MY ADDRESS
THE CONCLUSION APPEARED TO BE INEVITABLE
NOW LISTEN
WHAT DOES HE MEAN MR LEFRANK BY SPEAKING TO ME IN THAT WAY
MAKE YOUR SEARCH
OPPOSITE TO THEM CROUCHED ON THE WINDOW-SEAT HIS EYES WANDERING HIS HANDS HANGING HELPLESS WE NEXT DISCOVERED SILAS MEADOWCROFT PLAINLY SELF-BETRAYED AS A PANIC-STRICKEN MAN
AND THEN WE ENTERED UPON THE DEFENSE FOUNDED ON AMBROSE MEADOWCROFT'S STORY
SHE SAW PLAIN SIGNS OF THE FAILURE OF THE DEFENSE IN THE LOOK AND MANNER OF THE COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECUTION
I MAY HAVE BEEN WRONG
YOU ARE RELATED TO THE FAMILY HERE SHE RESUMED AND I AM RELATED TOO
I SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THE STICK TO A DEAD CERTAINTY BUT FOR SILAS PULLING ME BACK BY THE HAND
I THINK I CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND ME
THAT SHE SHOULD CONTEMPLATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN THE BARE POSSIBILITY OF NOT MARRYING AMBROSE WAS I AM ASHAMED TO SAY A DIRECT ENCOURAGEMENT TO CERTAIN HOPES WHICH I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FORM IN SECRET
DO YOU UNDERSTAND HIM JOHN JAGO SIGNED TO ME IMPLORINGLY TO LET HIM ANSWER FOR HIMSELF
