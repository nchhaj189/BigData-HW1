THE VILLAIN IS MARRIED TO ANOTHER
AT THE TRIAL THINGS LOOKED BLACK AGAINST RICHARD
HAVE YOU TRIED LETTING THE QUEEN BE TAKEN BY BLACK'S PAWN THEN SACRIFICING THE KNIGHTS AND FINALLY MATING HIM WITH THE KING ALONE YES SAID CAREY
POOR BLIGHT
BETTER BUT LEAVES TOO MUCH TO THE ACTOR
DO PLAY IT AGAIN
THEN JACQUES PICKED UP HIS GLASS AND POURED THE WINE OF THE COUNTRY OVER HIS FRIEND'S HEAD
I'VE JUST REMEMBERED OH DOES IT MATTER FOR A BOTANICAL PAPER YES AND THEN CELIA HAD A BRILLIANT INSPIRATION
BLIGHTY I THINKS
HOW VERY TRUE I COULDN'T QUITE FOLLOW IT DEAR SAYS HER NEIGHBOUR FRANKLY
DELIGHTFUL
TWO OF US HAVE TO SLEEP OUTSIDE SHE SAID
I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A HORSE SIMPLY AS A NICE HORSE OR A NASTY HORSE
THE OTHER THREE LADIES ADDED THEIR FRENCH TO HERS
FOR INSTANCE WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THESE PATENT EXTENSION LADDERS IN CASE THE GERANIUMS GROW VERY TALL AND YOU WANT TO CLIMB UP AND SMELL THEM
THEN THAT JUST SHOWS HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT I RETORTED
WE HAVE REACHED THE RENDEZVOUS
I SAT BESIDE HER AND ANNOYED A LIMPET
M FOR MOTHER THAT GAVE ME AN IDEA
SHE HAD RUNG UP HER BROTHER AT THE FLAT WHERE HE WAS STAYING AND FINDING THAT HE WAS OUT SHE GAVE A MESSAGE FOR HIM TO THE PORTER
IF YOU CAME TO ME AND SAID I AM ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE AND BULLS ARE GOING DOWN OR UP OR SIDEWAYS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE
SHE WAS THE SISTER WHOM THE JUST HOLD THE LINE A MOMENT SIR IMPLORED THE PORTER
UN MOMENT HE SAYS TO THE PORTER
THERE IS NO NEED FOR HARSH WORDS BETWEEN US
AND WITH ALGERNON THE OVERWHISKERED CRUSTACEAN FIRMLY CLUTCHED IN THE RIGHT HAND AND STONEHENGE SUPPORTED ON THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND I RETIRED
IN THIS MANNER
ACCORDING TO THE RULES IF I ASK YOU HOW MANY AND YOU GIVE WRONG INFORMATION IT'S THIRTY-FIVE HE SAID PROMPTLY
WHAT WAS THERE ORIENTAL ABOUT BINGO
EACH POET WILL RECITE A SHORT SAMPLE OF HIS POETRY AFTER WHICH NO DOUBT YOU WILL GO HOME AND ORDER FROM YOUR BOOKSELLER A COMPLETE SET OF HIS WORKS LADY POLDOODLE GOES QUICKLY OVER TO HIM AND WHISPERS VIGOROUSLY
THE BULL-DOG BARKED LOUDLY AT SIMPSON IN ENGLISH
THIS SAID HIS MAJESTY DRAMATICALLY THROWING OUT A HAND IS A PRINCE IN DISGUISE WHICH ONE FATHER SAID AMARIL
WHICH STRIKES ME AS RATHER SWEET AND NATURAL
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL EVERYBODY AH BUT THE SACRIFICES YOU ARE MAKING AM I SAID CELIA WITH INTEREST
YOU MAYN'T BRUSH IT AWAY AND AFTER A FIERCE ARGUMENT ON THE POINT HE PUTTED HASTILY--AND BADLY
BECAUSE A RIDICULOUS REASON AS A CHILD SHE HAD HAD A POODLE CALLED BINGO
YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE-_FIVE I WANT DOUBLE-_NINE
IT WAS NOW THE AUTHORITY'S TURN TO GET THE REPROACHFUL LOOKS
WHEREUPON THE HANDKERCHIEF FLARES UP
THIS LAST INSULT IS MORE THAN FLESH AND BLOOD CAN STAND ANOTHER BLOOD HAD GOT IN BUT IT WAS A NEW SENTENCE AND HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN
SUFFICIENT THAT SHE LOOKED DAZZLING THAT AS A PARTY WE WERE REMARKABLY WELL-DRESSED AND THAT SIMPSON--MURMURING DIX-SEPT TO HIMSELF AT INTERVALS--LED THE WAY THROUGH THE ROOMS TILL HE FOUND A TABLE TO HIS LIKING
HE HAD MARCHED ROUND IN NINETY-SEVEN THAT MORNING FOLLOWED BY A SMALL CHILD WITH AN UMBRELLA AND AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND HE FELT IN FORM WITH HIMSELF
FAR BETTER AS MUST OFTEN HAVE OCCURRED TO MILTON TO STRIVE FOR THE FUTURE THAN TO REGRET THE PAST
LORD SMITH HE STORMED
GREAT HE EXTEMPORIZED IS TRUTH AND IT SHALL FLOURISH GREATLY THE SERGEANT TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND LED HIM TO THE CAPTAIN AND THE CAPTAIN TRIED TO UNDERSTAND AND MORE OR LESS SUCCEEDED
I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY OLIVES GROWING ON THEM TOO EARLY SAID ARCHIE
WE FELT THAT THE MERE SIGHT OF THIS WEIGHING-MACHINE TWICE DAILY WOULD STIMULATE THE GAPS BETWEEN MY RIBS
WELL MY MAN SAID HIS MAJESTY GENIALLY THIS IS INDEED PLEASANT HEARING
AND THE ORIGINAL E.M.W IF HE HAS THE SENSE TO READ THIS ALSO KNOWS
STILL THE BAR REMAINED UP
OH NO I SAID QUICKLY
AS THEY WERE DRAGGED TOGETHER UP THE SHIP'S SIDE HE HEARD HER MURMUR IS LITTLE JASPER SAFE JASPER CRIED RICHARD
GUEST LUCKILY
I ACCEPTED GLADLY
IT WOULD BE RATHER FUN SHE SAID
DEAD SILENCE
I THOUGHT HE SAID COMING TO THE POINT AT ONCE THAT IT MIGHT AMUSE YOU TO DRIVE OVER WITH ME TO FLAMBOROUGH HEAD
GOT IT HE CRIED SUDDENLY AND THE BALL SAILED OUT ON TO THE PRETTY
YES HE SHOUTED MR BROWNIE TO THE ROOF
I BELIEVE HE'S PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME MURMURED CELIA TO MRS PETER
SO I MADE SUCH A COLLECTION LEAVING OUT THE MORE TOPICAL AND ALLUSIVE SKETCHES AND INCLUDING THOSE WITH A MORE GENERAL APPEAL
JACK ELLISON HAD BEEN SILENT DURING THE LAUGHTER AND JOLLITY ALWAYS SUCH A FEATURE OF HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL AT CHRISTMAS-TIME BUT NOW HE CONTRIBUTED AN INGENIOUS PUZZLE TO THE AMUSEMENT OF THE COMPANY
IT'S MORE THAN A FELLOW CAN DO HE SAID
VII
III RICHARD'S FIRST ACT ON ARRIVING IN LONDON WAS TO GO TO MR BELLINGHAM'S HOUSE
IT IS DIFFICULT ISN'T IT SAID HERBERT
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR SOME MAGIC LETTER GO FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS KIND ENOUGH TO SAY THAT WE ARE VERY OLD FRIENDS YES OF COURSE THAT MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE
KNEE-DEEP IN CLOVER THE LAMBS AT DOVER NIBBLE AWHILE AND STARE
MY FIRST WIFE WAS DROWNED ALL THE TIME
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER TELL THE WEIGHING-MACHINE
WHEN DID THIS COME OVER YOU IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SAID ANNE
SHE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PORKINS WHO HAD MARCHED ROUND IN NINETY-SIX THE DAY BEFORE WAS NOW THOROUGHLY BRACED UP
HOW MANY HAVE YOU PLAYED EXACTLY I ASKED
CALLING ALSO THE ATTENTION OF HIS FAMILY TO IT AS AN EXCUSE FOR AN OUTING WHEN THEY WERE NOT OTHERWISE ENGAGED
OR IS IT THE--ANYWAY I'M CERTAIN YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PIECE OF ELASTIC UP THE SLEEVE
BILLETING IS DELIGHTFUL FUN
BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
ON THE SAME MORNINGS LITTLE JOHNNY ENTERS HIS MUSIC-ROOM UNDERNEATH AND GIVES HIMSELF UP TO MUSICAL COMPOSITION
THOMAS WE'RE AT TOULON WHERE THE ENTENTES CORDIALES COME FROM
AND THOUGH EVENTS IN THE END WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM I LIKE TO THINK THAT HI-YOU REMAINED LOYAL TO HIS FRIEND AND THAT IN HIS PLUSH-LINED STY IN A QUIET CORNER OF THE PALACE GROUNDS FREDERICK PASSED A GENTLE OLD AGE CHEERED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE VISITS OF AMARIL'S CHILDREN
DO YOU KNOW SAID CELIA WITH A PUZZLED LOOK ON HER FACE SOMETIMES I THINK I'M QUITE AN ORDINARY PERSON AFTER ALL YOU AREN'T A LITTLE BIT I SAID LAZILY
SEND IT TO ANOTHER PAPER SHE SAID
TO-MORROW AFTERNOON WE PUT OUR MONEY ON SEVENTEEN
I WANT TO THANK YOU SAID THE COLONEL FOR SO GALLANTLY RESCUING AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE--MAJOR MURGATROYD BELONGING TO THE NTH BATTALION BLANKSHIRES BUT NOW ATTACHED TO THE QTH SMITHLORD COULD HARDLY REPRESS A START
YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME SHE SAID
WHY DID LORD ARTHUR FLUFFINOSE ENTER
THE DAUGHTER OF THE SHEEP-FARMER WITH WHOM HE LODGED WAS A GIRL OF SINGULAR BEAUTY AND ANDREW'S YOUTHFUL BLOOD WAS QUICKLY STIRRED TO ADMIRATION
HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER SINCE BUT EVEN NOW TWENTY YEARS AFTER HE COULD NOT EAT AN ACID-DROP WITHOUT EMOTION AND A WHOLE BAG OF THEM BROUGHT THE SCENE BACK SO VISIBLY AS TO BE ALMOST A PAIN
THIS PROVED EFFECTIVE
THE ONLY THING IS I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TECHNIQUE AND STAGECRAFT AND THE THREE UNITIES AND THAT SORT OF ROT
I HAD NONE
ONE DOESN'T OFTEN HEAR THEM IN THIS COUNTRY
NEW FACES MOST AND KEEN BECOS THEY THINKS THE THING IS ENDING SOON
THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASON FOR THIS
TO CALL HIM BY THE NAME OF A LATE POODLE MAY JUST BE THE DECIDING FACTOR
SEE IF YOU CAN BE MORE SUCCESSFUL
HE HAD COMPOUNDED THE MAGIC POTION
IT WAS NOT THE COLOUR OF THE LITTLE PIG NOR THE CURLINESS OF HIS TAIL ENDEARING THOUGH THIS WAS NOR EVEN THE MELTING EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES WHICH WARMED THE SWINEHERD'S HEART BUT THE FEELING THAT INTELLECTUALLY THIS PIG WAS AS SOLITARY AMONG THE HUNDRED AND FORTY OTHERS AS HI-YOU HIMSELF
AND HERE AM I AND SOMEWHERE IN THE CITY I BELIEVE HE IS A STOCKBROKER IS ERMYNTRUDE'S HUSBAND AND WE PLAY OUR GOLF ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AND GO TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AND--WELL ANYHOW THEY WERE BOTH MARRIED AND CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON ERMYNTRUDE
SO HERE THEY ALL ARE ONE FURTHER WORD OF EXPLANATION
THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY CHARGE MORE THAN A SHILLING A HEAD TO LISTEN TO ME
BLACK HAD ONLY LEFT HIMSELF WITH A PAWN AND A KING WHILE WHITE HAD A QUEEN AND A COUPLE OF KNIGHTS ABOUT
BUT IT'S REALLY RATHER FUNNY YOU KNOW AND THEN SHE HAD ANOTHER BRILLIANT INSPIRATION
EVEN WERE I REVERED IN THE YEAR 2000 A.D
O KEILLER
WHAT SHALL WE PUT I HAD FELT THE QUESTION COMING
THE OWL WITHIN THE IVIED TREE MAKES LOVE TO ME MAKES LOVE TO ME
DOWN I GOES
WE OUGHT TO LOOK AS IF WE'D JUST RUN UP FROM OUR LITTLE WINDOW-BOX IN THE COUNTRY AND WERE GOING BACK BY THE LAST TRAIN
AFTER YOU WITH STOPES PERHAPS THERE'S A YOUNG BARLOW A BARLOWETTE OR TWO WITH EXPECTATIONS
WHAT A BLEND
WHAT OF THE RIVER THERE WHERE BYRON'S POOL LAY THE WARM BLUE MORNING SHIMMERING IN THE HAZE NOT THIS I SAY
ROOMS ALL ON DIFFERENT LEVELS AND OF DIFFERENT SHAPES WITH DELIGHTFUL PLACES TO BUMP YOUR HEAD ON
NOW THE KING HAD NEVER BEEN IN MILVANIA
A FRIEND AND HE JUST HELD THE LINE FOR YOU AND ME AND KEPT THE GERMANS FROM THE SEA AND DIED--WITHOUT THE O.B.E
I'M EVER SO MUCH OLDER NOW
TWO BAGS TWO COATS A CAMERA A RUG THOMAS GOLF-CLUBS BOOKS--HIS COMPARTMENT IS FULL OF THINGS WHICH HAVE TO BE KEPT UNDER HIS EYE LEST THEY SHOULD EVADE HIM AT THE LAST MOMENT
BUT THIS CONVERSATION ONLY TAKES PLACE IN MY MORE HOPEFUL MOMENTS
HE GOT THE D.S.O
BUT A MONTH LATER THE REVUE COLLAPSED
WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE KNOCKING UP AGAINST TRIPPERS IN THE GARDEN ARCHIES AND SAMUELS AND THOMASES AND WHAT NOT
BUT NO DOUBT HIS DINING-ROOM LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
YOU JOLLY WELL SHUT UP HE SAID TURNING INDIGNANTLY TO HIS SISTER
AFTER ALL THAT IS FOR OUR SECONDS TO ARRANGE
THEY RESIGN--THEY RESIGN TO AVOID BEING SHOT WELL ANYHOW THEY RESIGN
MRS HERBERT REPEATED HER HUSBAND'S TRIUMPH WITH THE AND THEN IT WAS MY TURN AGAIN FOR THESE HORRIBLE CAMELS
I SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF IT THE OTHER NIGHT HE SAID SMILING ROUND AT ALL OF US IN HIS HAPPINESS AND I WAS JUST GOING TO WAKE THOMAS UP TO TELL HIM WHEN I THOUGHT I'D KEEP IT A SECRET
YET IT IS ON THAT ONE WORD ENTER THAT HIS REPUTATION FOR DRAMATIC TECHNIQUE WILL HANG
YOU WERE TELLING ME WHEN WE WERE OUT SHOOTING YESTERDAY BOLSOVER CAPTAIN BOLSOVER LOOKED SURPRISED
THE LAST OF THE WAR STORIES I THE COLONEL OF THE NTH BLANKSHIRES WAS SEATED IN HIS OFFICE
ONE BY ONE THEY FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
AND IT ISN'T AS THOUGH I COULD EVEN MOVE ON TO MESOPOTAMIA COULDN'T THERE BE A LITTLE LOCAL RISING IN PERSIA SUGGESTED CELIA
I WANT TO SEE THE WHOLE POSITION OF WOMEN ALTERED
BREAKING FREE FOR A MOMENT FROM THE VICE-LIKE GRIP OF THE OTHER JASPER LEAPT WITH THE SPRING OF A PANTHER AT ONE OF THE SAILS OF THE WINDMILL AS IT CAME ROUND AND WAS WHIRLED UPWARDS
I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AFTER ALL ITS REALLY MUCH MORE FUN HAVING CAMELS AND THINGS SAID CELIA
HIS FIRST VIEW OF THE COUNTRY WAS AT ROUEN WHEN HE SAT AT THE ENTRANCE TO MY TENT AND HOOSHED THE EARLY MORNING FLIES AWAY
YOU'RE WANTED BY THE SERGEANT-MAJOR SIR HE TOLD THE COLONEL
FOR YOUR SAKE I SAID I WON'T SO THAT SETTLES IT
I AM ONLY WRAPPED UP IN HIM AS A SPRINTER AREN'T YOU GOING TO TRY TO MOVE HIM AGAIN HE'S NOT QUITE READY YET
WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY IS THAT JENNY HAS LET HIM DOWN AGAIN
THE CHARGE OF THE UHLANS BY KARL BOHM
FOR THAT SUMMONS MEANT THE BREAKING UP OF HIS HOME
SIMPSON LOOKS ROUND WILDLY FOR THOMAS
STAGECRAFT IS THE ART OF GETTING OVER THESE AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES AND IF POSSIBLE GETTING OVER THEM IN A SHOWY MANNER SO THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY HOW REMARKABLE HIS STAGECRAFT IS FOR SO YOUNG A WRITER WHEN OTHERWISE THEY MIGHTN'T HAVE NOTICED IT AT ALL
WHAT YOU WANT IS A TONIC QUITE BETWEEN OURSELVES THOUGH I REALLY THINK BUT NO
FULL SETS OF THE AUTHOR'S WORKS CAN BE OBTAINED ON THE WAY OUT
FROM GENERAL PETAIN THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN ELEPHANT FROM OUR JAPANESE ALLIES THE ORDER OF THE SPLIT HADDOCK FROM THE PRESIDENT OF NICARAGUA AND THE ORDER OF THE NEUTRAL NUT FROM BRAZIL
ONCE MORE LORD JOHN LIGHTING CIGARETTE
WILL YOU BE IN FOR LUNCH I SHALL BE WRITING MY LECTURE ALL DAY I SAID BUSILY
YOU SHALL TELL ME WHOM MOST YOU SEEM TO SEE THERE
I SHALL JUST PUT AN ORDINARY BLURRED EXPRESSION ON NOW ARE YOU READY
VERY WELL
VERY WELL
VERY WELL
AND RICHARD HENRY LOOKS TRIUMPHANTLY AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ANY SMALL CLOUD ON THE HORIZON WILL DO I KNOW IT ON THE MAP YES BUT IT LOOKS QUITE DIFFERENT IN REAL LIFE
WHAT SHALL I SHOW YOU NOW SAYS JENNY
HE WAS JUST AS FRIENDLY IN REFUSING TO TAKE THESE ADVANTAGES JUST AS PLEASANT IN OFFERING SIMILAR INDULGENCES TO ME
YOUR SHAW
A MIDSUMMER MADNESS THE GIRL WHO SHARED HERBERT'S MERINGUE AT DINNER A BRITTLE ONE WHICH EXPLODED JUST AS HE WAS GETTING INTO IT WAS KIND AND TACTFUL
WE ARE NOW IN LONDON AGAIN WHERE I AM PUTTING ON FLESH
AT THE END OF THE SECOND MONTH GASPARD WROTE TO JACQUES
FROM INSIDE I ASSURED HER
THERE FOLLOWED A LONG CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THE AUDIBLE PART OF IT THAT IS CELIA'S CONSISTING OF MY NAME GIVEN FORTH IN A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS IN THE MANNER OF ONE WHO SINGS AN ANTHEM--HOPEFULLY PATHETICALLY DRAMATICALLY DESPAIRINGLY
ENTER LORD LARKSPUR BY DOOR AT BACK WHY HERE YOU ARE
HE DID THIS SO SUCCESSFULLY THAT AT THE END OF THE EVENING HE WAS CONVINCED THAT IT WAS NOT MARIA WHO HAD JILTED HIM BUT THE ESSENLAND CAPTAIN WHO HAD JILTED MARIA
COME ALONG DARLING AND SEE THE CRAB SHE SAYS PICKING UP HIS HAND
I HEARD IT AT THE CLUB TO-DAY FROM A FRIEND OF HIS THEN WE KNOW THAT ONCE AGAIN THE BARBER'S ASSISTANT HAS BEEN GOSSIPING OVER THE LATHER
LASTLY THERE IS MR SAMUEL SIMPSON
AFTER THAT WE HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES AND FINALLY WE WERE CUT OFF FROM HEADQUARTERS ALTOGETHER AND HAD TO CARRY ON ON OUR OWN
NOR WERE HENRY POLHENERY AND THOMAS PENTUMMAS
AH EXCUSE ME A MOMENT SAID THE LATTER TO HIS SECOND IN COMMAND KNOWING HOW MUCH IT ANNOYS A SERGEANT-MAJOR TO BE KEPT WAITING
THAT IN FACT IS THE GAME OUR HOST GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR
WE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE FOR DINNER THAT NIGHT AND CELIA GOT THE PAPER AND READ IT ALOUD TO MY TUNIC
LET'S TAKE TRAIN SOMEWHERE SAID CELIA AND HAVE LUNCH UNDER A HEDGE I KNOW A LOVELY PLACE FOR HEDGES I SAID
WHAT BABIES THEY ALL ARE SAID THE VERY YOUNG GOD GOLD BRAID SAME OLD CROSSING SAME OLD BOAT SAME OLD DUST ROUND ROUEN WAY SAME OLD NARSTY ONE-FRANC NOTE SAME OLD MERCY SIVVOO PLAY
IF SHE CAN'T DO THIS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH USE COMING TO THE SEASIDE AT ALL
IF IT WERE GOING TO BE THIRTY-FOUR THEY SHOULD HAVE USED ONE OF ARCHIE'S SCORES AND MADE A GOOD JOB OF IT
I TOOK THEM OFF HURRIEDLY AND STEPPED ON
IT MAY BE THAT PERCY IS FOND OF FISHING LORD BLIGHT SHIFTED UNCOMFORTABLY IN HIS SEAT
SIMS
FOR SOME REASON HE DISTRUSTED THE MAJOR
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE
WE MIGHT WIN GOOD IDEA SAID THOMAS
AND HE HAS TO BE CONTENT WITH THAT
IV A MONTH WENT BY AND THEN HI-YOU CAME TO THE KING WITH NEWS
FOR A NEW YORK CRITIC ENDED HIS REVIEW OF HAPPY DAYS WITH THESE IMMORTAL WORDS
A FEW GUESTS BAD LORD BLIGHT A MORAL STORY FOR THE MIDDLE-AGED I SEATED IN THE WELL-APPOINTED LIBRARY OF BLIGHT HALL JOHN BLIGHTER SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT BOWED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO DESPAIR
YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT JOKE IN YET SHE HAD JUST READ AN ARTICLE OF MINE CALLED AUTUMN IN A COUNTRY VICARAGE IT WOULDN'T GO IN THERE VERY WELL I SAID
MOTHER'S RESPECTS AND SHE HAS FOUND THE OTHER SHIRT-FRONT AND WILL SEND IT UP AS SOON AS IT IS DRY HE HAD OFTEN TAKEN A SIMILAR MESSAGE FOR MRS PENQUARTO DID THE WASHING FOR THE UPPER SERVANTS AT THE HALL BUT SOMEHOW HE HAD KNOWN THAT TO-DAY WAS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
THERE WERE OTHER GUESTS BUT AS THEY CHIEFLY PLAYED THE PART OF AUDIENCE IN THE EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED THEIR NAMES WILL NOT BE OF ANY SPECIAL INTEREST TO OUR READERS
I BELIEVE THERE'S A FLY ON THE CEILING IT IS A CHALLENGE WHICH NO GREAT-GRANDSON OF GOODWOOD LO COULD RESIST
A MONTH LATER OUR HERO WAS BACK IN ENGLAND
WELL LOOK HERE I'LL BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU
CAN YOU GIVE ME A FEW HINTS?"--SUPPOSE YOU SPOKE TO ME LIKE THIS THEN I COULD DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
OH YES SAID MY HOSTESS
IN SPITE OF HIS SUCCESS HE WAS NEVER QUITE AT EASE IN SOCIETY AT THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE
THAT ONE ENDED SO VERY SUDDENLY AFTER MUCH INWARD AND OUTWARD WRESTLING MISS HERRICK ANNOUNCES
FOR ALL HE HAD CAUGHT OF OUR MUMBLED INTRODUCTION I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BLACKMAN MYSELF
WASPS AND THEIR YOUNG LECTURE DELIVERED ETC
AND TO OUR GREAT JOY THE WINDOW-BOX WAS IN POSITION WHEN WE GOT HOME AGAIN
AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND AN ORDERLY CAME IN
IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THIS FIELD
YOU SEE HOW EASY IT IS SAID ARCHIE
REACHING WEYMOUTH AT NIGHTFALL HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE HOUSE WHICH HYACINTH HAD TAKEN IN ORDER TO BE NEAR HIM AND SUITABLY DISGUISED TRAVELLED UP TO LONDON WITH HER IN THE POWERFUL MOTOR WHICH SHE HAD KEPT READY
BEGGED MYRA'S PARDON SEVERAL TIMES
I GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT HE HAD NOT RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF THE MAN HE HAD SAVED
DO YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO--NOW
BUT SOMETIMES IF WE ARE VERY VERY CLEVER HE DOESN'T
ARTHUR WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
THEY'LL BE HERE DIRECTLY ARCHIE AND DAHLIA CAME FIRST
WHEREFORE HE STILL GAZED AT THE PRINCE AND AT LENGTH HE SAID WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THAT HI-YOU FELLOW YOU WILL NEVER HEAR OF HIM AGAIN SAID THE PRINCE PLEASANTLY
ANOTHER CUP WON'T YOU SAYS MISS GLADYS COOPER
COME IN SAID COLONEL BLOWHARD
AND I STILL ASSURE YOU THAT IT IS TRUE
I MEAN ANYTHING SPECIALLY RIVIERISH
IT WAS A NEAR THING SOMETIMES AND I WOULD THINK THAT I HAD THEM BUT AT THE LAST MOMENT THEY WOULD WHISK OFF AND BACK INTO THEIR HOLES AGAIN
A ZAMBRA SEARCHING VAINLY FOR NEGRETTI
AND HIS LITTLE BLACK COLLAR HIS ONLY KIT DISAPPEARED
THE PINK FOR AULD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE ENGRAVED IN SUGAR ON THE CAKE WAS HIS
IN ALL THE DRAWING-ROOMS OF MAYFAIR IN ALL THE CLUBS OF PALL MALL PEOPLE WERE ASKING EACH OTHER WHO IS JOHN PENQUARTO NOBODY KNEW--SAVE ONE
YES DEAR READER YOU ARE RIGHT
THE REMORSE THE BITTERNESS
IS THAT YOU EXCHANGE
AND NOW AT LAST THE LETTER HAD COME AND HE WAS SEATED IN THE OFFICE OF THE GREAT MR PUMP HIMSELF
WHATEVER'S THE MATTER
WITHIN THESE WALLS THE COLONEL WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DEAL OUT STERN JUSTICE TO OFFENDERS AND MANY A HARDENED CRIMINAL HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT FAINTING UPON HEARING THE TERRIBLE VERDICT ONE DAY'S C.B BUT THE COLONEL WAS NOT HOLDING THE SCALES OF JUSTICE NOW FOR IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON
OTHERWISE MRS MALLORY FACES THE APPROACHING SEASON WITH CALM IF NOT WITH COMPLETE APPRECIATION
WE STOOD IN THE CORRIDOR AND DRANK IT IN
THE PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT--ER--AN ENCHANTER HAS--ER--WELL YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU YOURSELF SUGGESTED I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID HI-YOU WHO SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING
THAT IS THE QUESTION--EH OLD FIDO BOY
I QUITE SEE THAT WITH A BICYCLE HE SAID IT'S DIFFERENT AND SO THERE YOU HAVE THE SECOND REASON
ARCHIE LOOKED AT ME
I EXPECT IT'S GOT USED TO YOU SAID CELIA WHEN I TOLD HER THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS
BUT THERE MY RESPONSIBILITY ENDED
IT ISN'T TILL FEBRUARY SAID SIMPSON EAGERLY
CERTAINLY HE MUST STAY WITH US AT THE PALACE
I'M GOING TO SPELL IT I SHOUTED
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN TEN LETTERS THAT I ABSOLUTELY MUST WRITE THIRTY WHICH I OUGHT TO WRITE AND FIFTY WHICH ANY OTHER PERSON IN MY POSITION WOULD HAVE WRITTEN
SAME OLD BLOODY WAR
HE WAS QUITE PLEASED WITH THE IDEA AND PROMISED TO RETURN THE PIANOLA WHEN HE GOT SICK OF IT
AND FOR THE MOMENT IT ENDED THE JOKE
PLATOON 15 CARELESSLY
CONFIDENT AS HE IS HIMSELF HE IS TAKING NO RISKS
HOWEVER THERE IT IS AND I ENLARGED A LITTLE MORE ON THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING IN THESE DIFFICULT WORDS
O DUNDEE
BUT HE ROSE TO THE OCCASION NOBLY
THE SPIRIT OF THE CUP HUNG OVER IT AND DEPRESSED US
IT IS CALLED THE THREE QUESTIONS AS BEFORE YOU ASK A GENTLEMAN IN THE COMPANY TO WRITE DOWN A NUMBER ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND A LADY TO WRITE DOWN ANOTHER NUMBER
SWINDLED--THAT'S THE WORD HE WANTS
AND THE CROUPIER'S VOICE TREMBLING FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THIRTY YEARS DIX-SEPT THEN GOLD AND NOTES WOULD BE PUSHED AT THE CHEVALIER
BUT I DON'T CARE I'M GOING TO GET THE LITTLE BEAST INTO THE HOLE IF IT TAKES ME ALL NIGHT HE WENT ON HACKING
BUT THIS IS MUCH THE MORE DIFFICULT THING TO DO AND FOR THE BEGINNER I SHOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THE 8.15 PLAY FOR WHICH THE RECIPE IS SIMPLE
AMONG THE MANY INTERESTS OF A LONG AND VARIED CAREER NO I DON'T THINK I SHALL BEGIN LIKE THAT
WE'RE GOING II
WHAT THE DEUCE HE SAID FOR LIKE ALL MILITARY MEN HE WAS ADDICTED TO STRONG LANGUAGE--"WHAT THE DEUCE DOES THIS MEAN I WAS INNOCENT SIR FATHER HE WAS INNOCENT HE WAS INNOCENT SAID A HOLLOW VOICE FROM THE NEXT BED
IT WAS GASPARD'S SECOND WHO INSISTED ON THIS CLAUSE
THUS YOU HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY WITH YOUR ENTRANCES
AN UNTROUBLED MIND AS SHAKESPEARE KNEW EVEN IF HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY IT IS MORE TO BE VALUED THAN RICHES
BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR ME BERKELEY--BERKELEY SQUARE
THEY'RE LIKE SHEEP AND COWS AND HORSES AND PHEASANTS AND--AND ANY OTHER ANIMAL
SHE GIVES A NERVOUS LITTLE GIGGLE PUSHES OUT HER FOOT WITHDRAWS IT AND BEGINS
IT IS A THOUGHT-READING ILLUSION AND ALWAYS CREATES THE MAXIMUM OF WONDERMENT AMONGST THE AUDIENCE
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING
I BEG YOUR PARDON MY LORD WHEN POOR ALGERNON STUMBLED AND--DO ANY OF YOU BOYS KNOW IF YOUR BROTHER CAN SWIM EVERARD THE NINTH SAID THAT ALGERNON HAD FLOATED ONCE IN THE PADDINGTON BATHS BUT COULDN'T SWIM
I SHOULD BE IN GAITERS REALLY OUR LITTLE WINDOW-BOX IS NOT IN THE COUNTRY OBJECTED CELIA
NONSENSE HE SAID
THANKS VERY MUCH MYRA BUT I MAY AS WELL WAIT FOR THOMAS AND--_GARCON DU CAFE POUR_--I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE--_DEUX CAFES GARCON S'IL VOUS_--IT'S GOING TO BE A LOVELY DAY THOMAS CAME IN QUIETLY SAT DOWN OPPOSITE SIMPSON AND ORDERED BREAKFAST
FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY_--HOWEVER YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT NOW
VOUS AVEZ PLACE POUR CENT HOMMES--OUI NON SAYS SHE--AND SO ON
ONE SEEMS TO WANT VERY MANY THINGS BUT THERE WAS NO HESITATION ABOUT COMMON'S RIGHT TO A PLACE
INDEED EVEN THE COLDEST PROFESSIONAL CRITIC WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OF IT AS A NOTEWORTHY RENDITION THE CHARGE OF THE UHLANS IF YOU CAME TO SEE ME YOU HAD TO HEAR IT
AN UGLY LITTLE GINGER DOG WITH A BIT OF RED TAPE FOR HIS TONGUE AND TWO BLACK BEADS FOR HIS EYES HE VIEWED HIS LIMITED WORLD WITH AN AIR OF INNOCENT IMPERTINENCE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO VISITORS
SWOONS THE SUBSEQUENT SCENE MAY BE SO PATHETIC THAT ON THE HUNDREDTH NIGHT IT IS STILL BRINGING TEARS TO THE EYES OF THE FIREMAN BUT YOU MUST NOT EXPECT TO BE TREATED AS A SERIOUS DRAMATIST
NOW SHE REMEMBERED THE NAME
ALL I ASK IS TO BE ALLOWED TO DEPART IN PEACE
I'VE JUST SENT LORD ARTHUR INTO THE LIBRARY TO LORD L
AH NO
AH NO
WE CAME BACK TO THE LINE TO-DAY TO FIND THAT THE CAT HAD KITTENED
IT WAS TO THE BANK
HE WAS THE STUPIDEST MAN I HAVE COME ACROSS FOR MANY YEARS
HE RETURNED MY ENTHUSIASM
IS HE OH WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS
HE'S NEARLY TWO AND HE OUGHT TO BE IN IT
IT WAS SOMETHING TO HAVE GOT HIM AS FAR AS THE BEACH SAID THE COUNTESS HOPEFULLY
A WEEK AND A HALF IS A LIFETIME LADDIE THE DAY THAT'S HERE IS THE DAY TO SEIZE
WHAT'S THE NUMBER TO BE WE ALL THOUGHT HARD FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS
AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN INSPIRATION PRESENTED THOMAS GRANDLY AS LE BEAU-PERE DU PETIT FILS DE MES AMIS MONSIEUR ET MADAME MANNERING THOMAS SEEMED MORE ASSURED OF HIS PLACE AS PETER'S GODFATHER THAN AS THE BROTHER OF THE GARDENER
HE REFUSES TO GIVE THEM BACK UNLESS I LET HIM MARRY HYACINTH
COME AWAY I SAID SEIZING THE TELEPHONE
HIS WIFE IS A GREAT FAVOURITE IN THE COUNTY
YES I AGREED
JUST HAVE SOMETHING NICE WRITTEN IN IT--SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND ME LIKE PISGAH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T KNOW
BUT MR BROWNIE NE BROWN NOT BROWNIE STOOD UPON ONE SIDE AND BROODED SILENTLY
WELL THE OTHER DAY THE MAJOR THOUGHT HE'D COME WITH ME JUST TO GIVE ME AN IDEA HOW IT OUGHT TO BE DONE
I MIGHT SO EASILY HAVE BEEN A CORPORAL BY NOW
THAT LAST WAS A BAD ONE EDITH GOOD I TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND BEGAN
HE HAS BITTEN ONE COMPANY COMMANDER REMOVED ANOTHER AND LED THE COLONEL A THREE-MILE CHASE ACROSS COUNTRY AFTER HIM SO IF ANY MISUNDERSTANDING OCCURS BETWEEN US THERE WILL BE GOOD PRECEDENT FOR IT
WHICH ONE SAID FATHER LAZILY
BUT PERHAPS HE WOULD NOT HAVE APPRECIATED THEM
BUT I CAN LEARN THEN I WILL LEARN TOO SAID GASPARD WITH DIGNITY
AT ALL COSTS I MUST BE ORIGINAL
AND THE THIRD AN ACCIDENTAL PUTT HAD SUNK IT 5 MYRA AND I HAD SEEN CORSICA
BUT THE REAL BEAUTY OF PRINCE FREDERICK'S CHARACTER DOES NOT LIE UPON THE SURFACE OR ANYHOW--ER--NOT AT THE MOMENT NO FATHER SIGHED AMARIL AND SHE LOOKED AT HI-YOU AGAIN
HOW SPLENDID
NOR DO I REGRET MY VENTURE
ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE DECIDED TO DROWN HIS SORROWS FIRST
I BEG YOUR PARDON CADDIE MY DRIVER PLEASE
AT ANY RATE I AM NOT ALLOWED TO WEAR SPURS AND THAT MUST WEIGH WITH A HORSE A GOOD DEAL
I MIGHT I SAID
I ONLY JUST BLOWED IT AT HIM WE WENT DOWN TO THE BASE HOSPITAL TOGETHER
FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE ROYAL LIBRARY UNTIL FREDERICK REALIZED THAT IT WAS HIS TURN TO SPEAK
I KNOW IT'S FOUR COWS BUT I CAN'T GET IT SORRY I SAID HOW STUPID OF ME
YOU BEGIN WITH ME I SAID AND I WAS PROMPTLY ASKED HOW MANY BLUE BEANS MAKE FIVE WHEN I HAD MADE A SUITABLE ANSWER INTO WHICH IT'S CAME WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY OUR HOST TURNED TO HERBERT
SINCE HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS NEW PROFESSION--AS A DISGUISE FROM THE POLICE WHO WERE STILL SEARCHING FOR HIM--HE HAD HAD A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE LION-TAMER WAS DOGGING HIM
ONLY IN TWO WAYS I SAID
QUITE ONE OF MY FAVOURITES
YOU SEE HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS
IF WE CALL HIM BINGO WILL YOU PROMISE NEVER TO MENTION IN HIS PRESENCE THAT YOU ONCE HAD A--A--YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN--CALLED BINGO SHE PROMISED
SOME DAY THE TRUTH WILL BE KNOWN THEN HE TOOK A TENDER FAREWELL OF HER AND CASTING A GLANCE OF MINGLED SUSPICION AND HATRED AT THE MAJOR HE STRODE FROM THE ROOM
YOU MIGHT TALK SERIOUSLY TO HIM TO-MORROW ABOUT IT TO-MORROW SAID THE EARL REFERRING ONCE MORE TO HIS DIARY BASIL AND I ARE VISITING THE ROMANTIC SCARPS OF FILEY IV ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT AT FILEY THE EARL AND COUNTESS OF BLIGHT RECLINED TOGETHER UPON THE CLIFFS OF BRIDLINGTON
AH NO IT WAS YOUNG REGGIE WORLOCK SAID THE SQUIRE WITH A HEARTY LAUGH
THE NEED FOR SELF-EXPRESSION WAS STRONG UPON HIM
THERE SAYS JENNY EXCITEDLY
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR WHAT SAYS LORD POLDOODLE
I MUST MARRY A MAN WITH A PIANOLA SHE SAID
OH WELL IF YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT I SAID I SUPPOSE I MUST SO I SETTLED DOWN TO A STORY ABOUT THE SALONICA FRONT
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S TRYING
IN THIS POSITION HE FOUND HIS USES
PERHAPS WE HAD BETTER TAKE SOME SANDWICHES AND MAKE A DAY OF IT GREATLY ELATED AT THE THOUGHT OF A DAY BY THE SEA LORD BLIGHT WENT OUT AND GAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COUNTESS FOR SANDWICHES TO BE CUT
IT IS MY HOPE SOME DAY TO REMIND HER OF A TURBOT AND MAKE HER HAPPY
FIRST YOU THINK OF A PROVERB LIKE A BURNT CAMEL SPOILS THE MOSS I EXPLAINED
NOW TRY AGAIN
RIGHT IT IS THE EVENING OF THE 3RD OF JUNE
HE LIT HIS PIPE AND ADDED SIMPSON WAS TELLING ME ABOUT HIS SYSTEM LAST NIGHT
IN THIS WAY THE DAYS PASSED HAPPILY AND CONFIDENCE BETWEEN THE ELEVEN PODBYS AND THEIR COUSIN WAS ESTABLISHED
RINGS BELL
IN AMAZEMENT THEY ALL LOOKED AT THE OFFICER LYING THERE
SAID I'D BALLY WELL--TOP-HOLE--WHAT?--DON'CHERKNOW
A MAN TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY THAT HE KNEW THIS FOR A FACT
SO THERE'S REALLY NOBODY BUT ONE'S BOWLING DAYS SOON GET OVER I HASTENED TO AGREE
WELL WELL HE SAID AT LAST WELL WELL WELL IN GREAT SURPRISE HI-YOU LOOKED UP AND THEN SEEING THAT IT WAS THE KING JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND BOWED SEVERAL TIMES
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE NET UP TO-MORROW HE SAID TO ME AS SOON AS I ARRIVED AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BOWL TO ME
HE WANTS TO GO
THEN THE TEA I HAD BOUGHT A CATALOGUE AND WAS SCANNING IT RAPIDLY
YET SOMEHOW HE COULD NOT
LADY LARKSPUR FLINGING HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS
IN THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN A MAN MUST MAKE LIGHT OF DANGER
A CYNIC MY DEAR ARTHUR HE OPENS CASE DELIBERATELY PUTS CIGARETTE IN MOUTH AND EXTRACTS GOLD MATCH-BOX FROM RIGHT-HAND TROUSER IS A MAN WHO STRIKES MATCH KNOWS THE PRICE OF LIGHTS CIGARETTE_)--EVERYTHING AND STANDING WITH MATCH IN ONE HAND AND CIGARETTE IN THE OTHER THE VALUE OF---PFF BLOWS OUT MATCH OF INHALES DEEPLY FROM CIGARETTE AND BLOWS OUT A CLOUD OF SMOKE_)--NOTHING
ANNE UNDERSTOOD THEN WHAT WAS TROUBLING HER
NEITHER I IMAGINE HAS TOBY
AGEL IN THREE
WE MEN MUST STICK TOGETHER
LEAVE IT TO ME
WE'VE ONLY GOT THE BURNING HOUSE AND THE 1913 DERBY LEFT
IF HE GOT INTO A BAD PLACE IN A BUNKER I WOULD ASSURE HIM IT WAS GROUND UNDER REPAIR
COMMON HAD SAT ON THE MANTELPIECE AT HOME
ISN'T IT SAID ANNE
THE TRAIN STOPS
WE WILL SPRINKLE FREDERICK TO-MORROW
BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO LET OUT ANY INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE OF VALUE TO CELIA'S ENEMIES--THE WICKED ONES WHO ARE TRYING TO SNATCH HER LITTLE FORTUNE FROM HER
IT IS OUR DUTY TO WEAN HIM FROM THESE WOMANISH APPREHENSIONS TOO LATE
THE COMPANY COMMANDER AND A SUBALTERN NAMED ROGERS STRUCK ME AS RATHER LACKING IN INTELLIGENCE
OR ELEVEN SAID THOMAS
SHE WOULD
A VISITOR TO SEE YOU SAID THE NURSE COMING IN AND WAKING PRIVATE SMITHLORD UP
JUST AS YOU FEEL SHE SAID WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO THE DENTIST BUT THEY HAD A BIG DINNER-PARTY THAT EVENING AND ANNE FULL OF THE JOY OF LIFE WAS NOT GOING TO LET ANYTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF HER ENJOYMENT OF IT
THERE IS NOW ONLY ONE BINGO AND HE IS A PEKINESE PUPPY
HIDDEN AWAY NO ONE KNOWS WHERE
NOW I KNOW A MAN WHO IS ACTUALLY IN IT AND HE SAYS_--AND HE KNOWS THIS FOR A FACT_--THAT FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE FIRST MAN DOWNED TOOLS--FROM THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE DOWNED TOOLS ANNE EDGED AWAY FROM HIM NERVOUSLY
THANK YOU
SHE POINTED TO THE BEACH
I WAS NOT SORRY BECAUSE IN ITS SILENCE IT WAS FAR FROM BEAUTIFUL AND WE WANTED ANOTHER BOOK-CASE BADLY
OTHERWISE WE MAY RESIGN OURSELVES AT ONCE TO THE PROSPECT OF BECOMING A FIFTH-RATE POWER IN THE EYES OF EUROPE AND IN A SPEECH GRAVELY APPLAUDED BY ALL PARTIES THE BOROVIAN CHANCELLOR SAID THE SAME THING
FIRST HIS BOOKS HIS TREASURED BOOKS
IT'S HAD IT WRONG BUT STILL IT'S HAD IT AND I CAN'T REPEAT IT CELIA BEGAN TO SMILE
AND HERE IN FACT WE ARE
SHE WAS THE SISTER WHOM THESE TWO SISTERS WERE SISTERS OF
OH WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID ARCHIE
BUT THE WAR PUT A STOP TO MUSIC AS TO MANY OTHER THINGS
YEARS ROLLED ON
ACCORDINGLY I PLACED THE BLOCK OF ICE ON THE SEAT TOOK OFF SOME OF ITS MORNING POST AND WRAPPED ALGERNON UP DECENTLY
THE NEW LIFE HAD BEGUN
THEN YOU SAY WHAT IS THE CAPITAL OF PERSIA SHE ANSWERS TIMBUCTOO OR OMAR KHAYYAM ACCORDING TO HOW WELL INFORMED SHE IS
THEY CLIMB UP THE WALLS OR THEY COME UP IN THE LIFT OR THEY GET BLOWN ABOUT BY THE WIND--I DON'T KNOW
OBVIOUSLY A BLACKMAN'S WARBLER EVERYBODY LOOKED AT THE AUTHORITY
ARCHIE LOOKED AT DAHLIA
WHEN THE LAUGHTER HAD DIED DOWN THE REVEREND ARTHUR MANLEY SAID
WE BROKE IT TO HIM AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT THE DOUBLE SHOCK WAS TOO MUCH AND HE PASSED THE EVENING IN ACUTE DEPRESSION
WOOLMAN THE MAGIC INITIALS
OF COURSE NOT BUT MY DEAR MAN THIS IS THEFT
I TOOK THE LAST SANDWICH AND PUT DOWN THE PLATE
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHOSE NAME YOUR WEAPONS SAID GASPARD VOLAUVENT GRANDLY
YOU HERE
IT WAS NOW CAPTAIN BOLSOVER'S TURN FOR AN AMUSING PUZZLE AND THE OTHERS TURNED EAGERLY TOWARDS HIM
LEAVING IT ON THE PAVEMENT I CLUTCHED THE LOBSTER AND WALKED HASTILY BACK THE WAY I HAD COME
WHEN HE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A CURIOUSLY APOLOGETIC AIR
HAM I AM WONDERING WHETHER TO BE OR NOT TO BE WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON-COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT
WE ARE GARDENERS SHE PAUSED A MOMENT FOR EFFECT
H'M
IT IS NOT JOHNNY BUT JNO
I'LL LEARN YOU TO STAND IN MY WAY HE SPLUTTERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT BUT I HATE MEN
I HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK SIR HE SAID AND FAINTED
AND ON THE LAST PAGE THE CLEVER KINDLY FACE OF SIMPSON
HE EMERGED ALONE WITH TAIL WAGGING AND WAS TAKEN ON TO HIS MISTRESS'S LAP
I SHALL GET HIM THERE BY FOUR CELIA WAS GAZING AT TWO BABY FISHES WHO PLAYED IN AND OUT A BUNCH OF SEA-WEED
AREN'T YOU HORATIO
NEARER TO THE ILL-FATED OFFICER HE DREW AND THEN SUDDENLY HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE ENEMY
IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF OSPOVAT WHICH IS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF RURITANIA THERE LIVED A MAIDEN CALLED MARIA STRULTZ WHO WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY CAPTAIN TOMSK
THEN YOU HAVE TO THINK AGAIN
AUTHOR
AUTHOR
TAKING OUT HIS WATCH AH THEN PERHAPS I'D BETTER EXIT BY DOOR ON LEFT MISS D TO LADY L HAVE YOU SEEN THE TIMES ABOUT HERE
MY SILENCE SINCE THEN WAS LULLING IT INTO A FALSE SECURITY AND IN ANOTHER TWO MINUTES I HOPED TO GET A MOVE ON IT AGAIN
IT IS A DIFFICULT STYLE OF WRITING TO KEEP UP PARTICULARLY WHEN THE NUMBER OF SYNONYMS FOR CONJURING IS SO STRICTLY LIMITED
NOT ONCE HAVE I BEEN IN A POSITION TO TAKE CONTROL
A WARM HALF-HOUR WHATEVER THE PAPERS SAY IT WAS THE HOTTEST AFTERNOON OF THE YEAR
THERE WAS NO COOK'S HOMME TO SAVE SIMPSON THIS TIME
WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO WITHDRAW THE HANDKERCHIEF BY A SERIES OF TRIFLING JERKS FROM THE POCKET OF YOUR FELLOW-GUEST TO ITS RESTING PLACE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FINGER OF YOUR LEFT HAND
WE MUST GET THE GENERAL FOR THE LAST PAGE SAID BLAKE
THERE WAS A PRINCE FREDERICK OF MILVANIA WHO HAD DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY
AND AS I SHUT MY EYES I SEEMED TO SEE--NO NOT THAT OLD CLAY HUT AMID THE WATTLES NOR YET THE ADOBE EDIFICE ON THE HEIGHTS OF ASIAGO BUT CELIA COMING INTO THE LIBRARY WITH ANOTHER PAPER ANNOUNCING THAT YET ANOTHER COUNTRY WAS DEAF TO THE CALL OF ART
QUICK CELIA I SAID SADLY I AM TWENTY-STONE-SEVEN
NO THANKS
GUEST TOUCHING HIS LIPS WITH THE CUP AND THEN RETURNING IT TO ITS SAUCER
IT WAS ONLY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS THAT HE HAD A CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND YET HE FELT SOMEHOW THAT SHE LOVED HIM
WE DON'T WANT FLOWERS I SAID
AND THERE IS TOBY AND SOMEBODY MUST RIDE HIM AND AS I POINT OUT TO THE OTHER SUBALTERNS IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE JEALOUSY IF ONE OF THEM RODE HIM AND WHY WOULD IT CREATE MORE JEALOUSY THAN IF YOU DO ASKED ONE OF THEM
WE SEE NOW THAT WE NEED NOT HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY
I HAD A FRIEND
YOU WILL SAY NO DOUBT THAT THIS WAS ALL VERY WELL BEFORE THE WAR BUT THAT IN THE ARMY A LITTLE WRITING WOULD BE A PLEASANT CHANGE AFTER THE DAY'S DUTIES
FREDERICK WAS A PRINCE IN DISGUISE
IF ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS OCCUR IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY RING ME UP AT THE OFFICE
FATHER IS LYING IN A DECK-CHAIR SMOKING HIS PIPE
IT DIDN'T HESITATE AT ALL JUST TRY AGAIN AFTER BREAKFAST TO MAKE SURE PERHAPS I'D BETTER TRY NOW I SAID GETTING UP BECAUSE IF I TURNED OUT TO BE ONLY TWENTY-STONE-SIX I MIGHT VENTURE ON A LITTLE PORRIDGE AFTER ALL
IT WAS A COTTAGE THE COTTAGE OF A DREAM
THEN AFTER DEEP THOUGHT THE PROFESSOR SAID
FOR THREE DAYS I WANDERED PAST GOLD AND SILVERSMITHS WITH THE RING IN MY POCKET
BY-AND-BY I SHALL GO INTO THE LIBRARY AND WORK
HE HAD RATHER A FUNNY EXPERIENCE
AH THEN I SUPPOSE WE'D BETTER KEEP BACK THE RESCUE FROM THE ALLIGATOR AND THE PLUNGE DOWN NIAGARA IN A BARREL ANDREW BELLINGHAM WAS DOZING IN HIS OFFICE
THIS WILL BE QUITE APPARENT TO YOU OF COURSE BEFORE I HAVE FINISHED BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT ALSO QUITE APPARENT TO ME
HE HANGS BACK A LITTLE AT FIRST
BUT I TELL YOU QUITE CANDIDLY THAT IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO LOSE PERCY IN A BOATING ACCIDENT AS IT WOULD BE FOR--SHALL I SAY?--SARGENT TO APPEAR AS HAMLET OR A VIOLINIST TO WISH TO EXHIBIT AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY
MY FRIEND HAS DRUNK ALL THIS GASPARD REMOVED THE WINE FROM HIS WHISKERS WITH THE LOCAL PAPER AND LEANT OVER THE TABLE TOWARDS JACQUES
HOW UNBUSINESS-LIKE OH THAT SAID ANDREW
ABOUT THIRTY
I WONDER IF YOU COULD LET ME HAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF YOUR ICE I VENTURED
I HAVE FORGIVEN HER FOR HAVING ONCE LOVED A POODLE
IN ITSELF APPARENTLY LITTLE
SO MR BROWN I MURMURED TO THE MAN AND HE--THE FOOL!--HE TOOK A MIGHTY BREATH AND SHOUTED MR BROWNIE!"--BROWNIE
AND THEN BEGAN A RACE SUCH AS HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN AT EPSOM OR MELTON MOWBRAY
LET YOUR ACTORS HAVE TEA BY ALL MEANS BUT SEE THAT IT IS A PROPERLY HISTRIONIC TEA
AND OTHERS INTRODUCTION MY PUBLISHER WANTS ME TO APOLOGIZE FOR--"INTRODUCE WAS THE KINDLY WORD HE USED--THIS COLLECTION OF ARTICLES AND VERSES FROM PUNCH
THE WORK WE DID WAS RARELY RECKONED WORTHY A TUTOR'S KINDLY WORD FOR WHEN I SAID WE GOT A SECOND I REALLY MEANT WE GOT A THIRD THE GAMES WE PLAYED WERE OFTEN TINGED WITH BITTER AMIDST THE DAMNS NO FAINTEST HINT OF PRAISE GREETED US WHEN WE MISSED THE AUTHENTIC SITTER BUT THOU WERT ALWAYS KIND O SALMON MAYONNAISE
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND
YOU SIT DOWN AND--AND WATCH THEM
IF THAT BE SO HE MUST EXPLAIN IT
OH BUT OF COURSE
CONSIDERING THAT I HADN'T HAD A PROOF IT CAME OUT EXTRAORDINARILY WELL
THE CHILDREN ARE GONE I SAID TO DICK
MUCH HAVE I SACRIFICED
BUT HE WAS ENTANGLED AT THAT MOMENT IN A WATERCRESS SANDWICH THE LOOSE ENDS OF WHICH WERE STILL WAITING TO BE TUCKED AWAY
AND PROCEED TO THE LECTURE-ROOM
ARE THERE ANY PEOPLE IN MARS SHE ASKED
TO DWELL UPON THE BRIGHT SIDE FIRST THERE WILL BE HALF-AN-HOUR'S CASUAL BOWLING AND AN HOUR AND A HALF'S MISCELLANEOUS COACHING EVERY DAY
GLANCING THROUGH IT JUST NOW I CAME ACROSS THIS KATE AVEZ-VOUS SOUPE AVANT LE SPECTACLE NON JE N'AVAIS GUERE LE COEUR A MANGER WELL THAT'S EASY ENOUGH
NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS AS INEVITABLE AS THAT
BUT AS WE NEARED THE FLAT I SUDDENLY BECAME NERVOUS ABOUT ALGERNON
MY SHIRT I MUST NOT SPEAK ABOUT MY SHIRT
ORANGES AND LEMONS II
NOTHING COULD TAKE AWAY FROM THAT
WELL HERBERT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LLOYD GEORGE YES SAID HERBERT
THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD BINGO DOWN
THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS THE GREAT QUESTION IN THE MALLORY FAMILY JUST NOW IS WHETHER DICK WILL GET INTO THE ELEVEN THIS YEAR
IT WARMED THEIR KINDLY HEARTS TO SEE THE JOY OF BILL AND JOHN AND ME FROM TEN TO LUNCH FROM LUNCH TO TEA FROM TEA TO SIX OR AFTER
TRUE THIS WAS READ FOR HIM OWING TO A SLIGHT AFFECTION OF THE THROAT FROM WHICH AS THE CHANCELLOR POINTED OUT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WAS TEMPORARILY SUFFERING BUT IT WOULD BE COUCHED IN THE MOST PERFECT TASTE AND SEASONED AT SUITABLE FUNCTIONS SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS THE OPENING OF THE FIRST PUBLIC BATHS WITH A PLEASANTLY RESTRAINED HUMOUR
I OFTEN WISH I KNEW MORE ABOUT BIRDS SHE SAID REGRETFULLY
WHEN WAR BROKE OUT I HAD PUBLISHED THREE OF THESE BOOKS IN ENGLAND THE GLEANINGS OF NINE YEARS REGULAR WORK FOR PUNCH
I HUNG WITH MEN AND WOMEN ON THE STAIRS AND WATCHED THE TALL WHITE FOOTMAN TAKE THE NAMES AND HEARD HIM SHOUT THEM OUT AND THERE I SHAPED MY OWN NAME READY FOR HIM MR BROWN AND MRS PHILBY PHIPP HEARING THE NAME WOULD I IMAGINED BRIGHTEN SUDDENLY AND SMILE AND SAY HOW ARE YOU MR BROWN AND IN AN INSTANT I'D REMEMBER HER AND WHERE WE MET AND WHO WAS MR PHIPP AND ALL THE JOLLY TIME AT GRINDELWALD IF THAT WAS WHERE IT WAS
IT'S SICKENING SHE SAID
OH NO NOT CARDS SAID CELIA QUICKLY
ITEM
ITEM
ITEM
ITEM
THE TELEGRAPH WIRE
ONE DAY IT MUST HAPPEN SO
AND THEN CAME CAUTIOUSLY UP AGAIN FOR MY PIPE
IN AN HOUR AND A HALF SHE WOULD BE DINING WITH US
THEN A WONDERFUL THING HAPPENED
EVERYBODY WHO WRITES TO ME TELLS ME OF A RELATION OF HIS WHO HAS BEEN SHEARING SHEEP OR ROWING AGAINST THE STREAM OR DEALING HIMSELF FOUR ACES
THE COLONEL LOOKED AT ME AND THEN HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE STATEMENT
SUCCESS HAD COME
WE'LL HAVE A TRENCH SCENE I SUGGESTED IT TO THE IMPRESARIO WHEN NEXT I SAW HIM
THANK GOD
AND THEN IT'LL BE ALL OVER
THEN IT ISN'T YOURS AT ALL I SAID IN AMAZEMENT
I FEAR THAT TO-MORROW"--HE CONSULTED A LEATHER POCKET-BOOK--"NO THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN TO HIM
YOU DO WANT TO MAKE THIS WINDOW-BOX A SUCCESS DON'T YOU I ASKED AS WE WANDERED ON
THIS DEAR MRS CARDEW IS OUR LITTLE PARTY
WELL I SHALL FILL IT IN MYSELF NOW HE TOOK A PENCIL AND WROTE
THE SECRET CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT--ARE WE ALONE EXCEPT FOR EACH OTHER COLONEL THE SECRET WENT ON THE COLONEL IS THIS
WITH A MOVEMENT FULL OF GRACE HE LET GO OF THE BAR AND SWUNG ON TO THE OPPOSITE PLATFORM
ALL WE DO IS TO GIVE A LIST OF THE MEALS IN WHICH IN THE ORDINARY COURSE WE ARE WONT TO INDULGE TOGETHER WITH A FEW NOTES ON OUR RELATIVE CAPACITIES AT EACH
DAWN AT SURBITON
MR MOTT HE SAYS IS I AM TOLD OUR LEADING EXPONENT OF WHAT IS CALLED VERS LIBRE WHICH MEANS--WELL YOU WILL SEE WHAT IT MEANS DIRECTLY MR MOTT A VERY UGLY LITTLE MAN WHO TRIES TO GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS BEING UGLY ON PURPOSE AND COULD EASILY BE BEAUTIFUL IF HE WERE NOT ABOVE ALL THAT SORT OF THING ANNOUNCES THE TITLE OF HIS MASTERPIECE
AUNT ALICE BENDING FROM THE HIPS AND BILL IN LITTLE RUNS AND TRIPS AND JOHN WITH FREQUENT HOPS AND SKIPS WHILE I WAS FAIRLY DANCING
THE FIRST THING WE CAME TO WAS A GOLF COURSE AND CELIA HAD TO DRAG ME PAST IT
INDEED IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE NEWS THAT WE OWNED A LARGE WINDOW-BOX HAD NOT YET GOT ABOUT
VERY DELICATELY I MOVED THE-THING-YOU-MOVE-UP-AND-DOWN TO ITS NEXT NOTCH
JENNY HAS BROUGHT FATHER AND MOTHER AS WELL AS RICHARD HENRY
THEY TORE HIS COLLAR THEY TORE HIS TIE THEY TOOK HIS GOLD CIGARETTE-CASE
A REVERIE TO ANOTHER EDITOR AND BEGAN AGAIN
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN A LITTLE MORE NOTICE TAKEN OF ME IN THE GAZETTE I SCAN IT EVERY DAY HOPING FOR SOME SUCH ANNOUNCEMENT AS THIS
HAVING OBTAINED ALL THESE THINGS WHICH MAY TAKE SOME TIME YOU PUT THE TWO TABLECLOTHS ASIDE AND SEPARATE THE OTHER ARTICLES INTO TWO HEAPS THE RABBIT THE TOP-HAT THE HARD-BOILED EGG AND THE HANDFUL OF NUTS BEING IN ONE HEAP AND THE RIBBON THE SPONGE THE GENTLEMAN'S WATCH AND THE TWO FLORINS IN THE OTHER
THE FILMS COMPRISE THE WELL-KNOWN BARESARK BASIL THE PRIDE OF THE RANCH TWO MILES LONG THE FOILER FOILED ONE MILE THREE FURLONGS TWO RODS POLES OR PERCHES THE BLOOD-STAINED VEST FRAGMENT--EIGHTEEN INCHES A MANIAC'S REVENGE 5,000 FEET THE LIFE OF THE COMMON MOSQUITO SIX LEGS AND SO FORTH TWENTY-FIVE YEARS BEFORE OUR FILM OPENS ANDREW BELLINGHAM A YOUNG MAN JUST ABOUT TO ENTER HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS WAS SPENDING A HOLIDAY IN A LITTLE FISHING VILLAGE IN CORNWALL
SIX OF ICE BILL HE SHOUTED TO AN INFERIOR AT THE BACK AND BILL TOTTERED UP WITH A BLOCK ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE OF THE LIONS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE
HE CAN'T THINK OF THE WORDS FOR WHAT HE IS FEELING
I KNOW A FELLOW OF TWENTY-THREE WHO GOT A JOB WITH A FAT M.P NOT CARING MUCH FOR THE INFANTRY AND HE--THANK GOD!--HAS THE O.B.E
THE FIRST MORNING I WEIGHED MYSELF JUST BEFORE STEPPING INTO THE WATER
THERE LOOMS A DAY I CAN FEEL IT LOOMING
THERE ARE WAYS OF SHIFTING THE EYEBROWS DISTENDING THE NOSTRILS AND EXPLORING THE LOWER MOLARS WITH THE TONGUE BY WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO DENOTE RESPECTIVELY SURPRISE DEFIANCE AND DOUBT
I DID COME DOWN AT ONCE AND TELL YOU HOW SORRY I WAS DIDN'T I YOU STEPPED BACK ON TO IT SAID THOMAS SHORTLY AND HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO THE COFFEE
WE CANNOT RECOGNIZE HIM
AND I HANDED HER THE WEDDING-RING
HOW SWEET OF HIM ALL THE LADIES SAY TO TELL HIS LITTLE BANTAM ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE NOT YET TIRED AS I AM OF THE PRINCE OF DENMARK I WILL EXPLAIN FOR THE LAST TIME HOW A MODERN AUTHOR MIGHT RE-WRITE HIS SPEECH
BUT LOOK HERE MY SON HERE'S A GOLF PROBLEM FOR YOU
AND SOME SAY THAT THEY FEASTED UPON ROAST PIG BUT I SAY NOT
WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN TOGETHER IN A GROUP
IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN YEARS WE SHALL BE THERE
CAN'T YOU SAY I'M OUT SAID SMITHLORD EXPECTING IT WAS ANOTHER FOREIGN DECORATION AND WONDERING WHAT LANGUAGE HE WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK THIS TIME
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD NEARLY PUT OUR MONEY ON TWO ASKED ARCHIE
IN AN 8.45 PLAY THE AUDIENCE MAY BE PLUNGED INTO THE DRAMA AT ONCE
YOU MUST GO FIRST




IT'S--IT'S A LOBSTER I SAID
JANE'S BUSY AND I'M BUSY AND AND I'M BUSY I SAID OPENING AND SHUTTING A DRAWER WITH GREAT RAPIDITY
TO A FRIEND OF
COMMON KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT A BUSY TIME FOR HIM
EXCITED BUT A TRIFLE COLD FOR IT WAS A FRESH MORNING AND THE UPPER PART OF THE WINDOW WAS WIDE OPEN I WENT UP FROM NINE STONE OUNCE BY OUNCE
THE EARL ROSE STRETCHED HIS HEAD OVER THE EDGE AND GAZED DOWN
HOWEVER I WAS NOT ANGRY WITH HIM FOR I HAD JUST MADE IT COME TO THREE COWS IT IS A COW SHORT BUT IT IS NEARER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE AND I THINK I SHALL LEAVE IT AT THAT
AT THREE OUNCES I STEPPED OFF FEELING RATHER SHAKEN
BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT--COME OVER THIS WAY A MOMENT WHERE THOMAS AND SIMPSON CAN'T HEAR WHILE I TELL YOU SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES I LED HER INTO A QUIET CORNER AND SUGGESTED A FEW THINGS TO HER WHICH I HOPED WOULD NOT OCCUR TO THE OTHER TWO
WELL AS I SAY I WAS ATTACHED TO MY NAME
GOLDEN MEMORIES WHEN MEMORY WITH ITS SCORN OF AGES ITS PREDILECTION FOR THE PAST TURNS BACK ABOUT A BILLION PAGES AND LANDS US BY THE CAM AT LAST
HAVE YOU GONE UP MUCH MUCH I SAID
THERE IS THE MUSIC-STOOL TO BE PURCHASED THE LIBRARY SUBSCRIPTION THE TUNER'S FEE FOUR VISITS A YEAR IF YOU PLEASE THE CABINET FOR THE ROLLS THE MAN TO OIL THE PEDALS THE--HOWEVER ONE GETS OUT OF THE SHOP AT LAST
NOW HER ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCESS AMARIL WAS OF AN AGE TO BE MARRIED
WHAT ABOUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID MRS PETER
DO YOU SEE THAT SURREY FAST OR SLOW SLOW--THAT IS YOU KNOW WHEN I DO BOWL AT ALL
TO REFLECT THAT ALL THE--ONE TWO
LORD POLDOODLE RISES TO INTRODUCE MR MONTAGU MOTT
I DIDN'T DARE FACE THAT WEIGHING-MACHINE IN MY CLOTHES AFTER THE WAY IN WHICH I HAD ALREADY STRAINED IT WITHOUT THEM
BUT IF YOU MIX IN THE RIGHT SOCIETY AND ONLY SEE THE WRONG PEOPLE ONCE IT IS REALLY QUITE EASY TO BE AN AUTHORITY ON BIRDS--OR I IMAGINE ON ANYTHING ELSE
WITH THE SPRING OF ANOTHER PANTHER ANDREW LEAPT ON TO THE NEXT SAIL AND WAS WHIRLED AFTER HIM
V THEY WERE MARRIED A MONTH LATER
JAPANESE NOT CHINESE IT IS TRUE
TO PICK HER UP WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT BUT HOW SHALL HE SAVE HER
I RUNS A BUSINESS WITH A PAL MEANING THE MISSIS FULHAM WAY
COULD HE EVEN KEEP HIS SHAWL
AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE NO HARM IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A BETROTHAL
HI YOU WHAT'S YOUR NAME THE SWINEHERD HASTENED TO EXPLAIN THAT HIS MAJESTY WITH HIS MAJESTY'S UNFAILING MEMORY FOR NAMES HAD GRACIOUSLY MENTIONED IT
VI HOW MANY TIMES THE TWO MADE AN END OF EACH OTHER AFTER THIS THE PICTURES WILL SHOW
A TERRIBLE CONTEST ENSUED
IT'S A SHAME TO ASK YOU ON A DAY LIKE THIS IT IS RATHER A SHAME I AGREED BUT I CAN ALWAYS REFUSE OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T
PARDON YOUR MAJESTY HE STAMMERED I DID NOT SEE YOUR MAJESTY
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT JOKE ABOUT THE RATS IN ONE OF YOUR LETTERS SAID CELIA ONE EVENING
LADY EVANGELINE TO LADY VIOLET AS THEY WALK ACROSS THE STAGE
BUT WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT HE WOULD REPLACE THE STRAW IN HIS MOUTH AND FALL WITH GREAT DILIGENCE TO THE COUNTING OF HIS HERD AND SUCH OTHER DUTIES AS ARE REQUIRED OF THE EXPERT PIGTENDER ASSURING HIMSELF THAT IF A MAN COULD NOT BE LIVELY WITH ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-ONE COMPANIONS HE MUST INDEED BE A POOR-SPIRITED SORT OF FELLOW
BUT NOW OBSERVE US APPROACHING MONTE CARLO
HERE YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SAID THE FISHMONGER WAVING ME AWAY
OR PERHAPS HERBERT DIDN'T GET IT QUITE RIGHT
I HAD READ AND ADMIRED HIS FAVOURITE VAURELLE--IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH
WHO ON EARTH IS MR BROWNIE
FOR A MONTH HE HAD BEEN HEWING STONE IN PORTLAND BLACK DESPAIR AT HIS HEART
EXCELLENT THEN HE WOULD LEAP ON TO HIS STEED AND PURSUE THE TRAIL RELENTLESSLY ONCE MORE
GOOD-BYE AND AS I WALKED OFF I PATTED MY FOREHEAD WITH MY HANDKERCHIEF AND WONDERED WHY THE DAY HAD GROWN SO WARM SUDDENLY
OH I WONDER WHAT IT IS
THE FIRST GAME THERE COMES A DAY I CAN HEAR IT COMING ONE OF THOSE GLORIOUS DEEP BLUE DAYS WHEN LARKS ARE SINGING AND BEES ARE HUMMING AND EARTH GIVES VOICE IN A THOUSAND WAYS THEN I MY FRIENDS I TOO SHALL SING AND HUM A FOOLISH LITTLE THING AND WHISTLE LIKE BUT NOT TOO LIKE A BLACKBIRD IN THE SPRING
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT
YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE COULD THEN RETIRE INTO PRIVATE LIFE FOR A LITTLE BUT IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
A FEMALE GROUP SURROUNDED BY A CAMEL THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY AND ALL OF THEM WERE TEN FEET HIGH AND ALL I THINK WERE HOLLOW
WHAT YOU WANT IS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU ARE CONVEYING HAMLET'S THOUGHTS TO THE AUDIENCE IN RATHER A CLEVER MANNER
NOBODY WAS NEAR AT THE TIME BUT SUPPOSING ONE OF THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING WITH IT
AS I DIP MY PEN IN THE INK AND BEGIN TO WRITE JOHNNY STRIKES UP
HOW VERY JOLLY FOR YOU SAMUEL FOR ALL OF US DAHLIA YOU AREN'T SUGGESTING WE SHALL ALL CROWD IN GROWLED THOMAS
AT TIMES HE USED TO SAY I MUST REALLY TAKE THAT CIGAR-CASE TO SCOTLAND YARD TO-MORROW AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD SAY SOMEBODY MUST REALLY TAKE THAT CIGAR-CASE TO SCOTLAND YARD TO-DAY AND SO THE WEEKS ROLLED ON
CELIA IF YOU'D LET ME HAVE A SUN-DIAL IN MY WINDOW-BOX I WOULD MEET YOU BY IT ALONE SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS LOVELY SHE SAID DOUBTFULLY
JUST IMAGINE YOU WERE ONE WOULDN'T YOU DETEST THE SUN
NOW WE SHALL SEE IF MR BARLOW IS A GENTLEMAN
EVEN THEN I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY LAUGHED PETER AND I WHO WERE PARTNERS ON THAT OCCASION ADMITTED THAT WE HADN'T LAUGHED
BAH
TILL THEN I HAD REGARDED HUMPHREY--SAVE FOR HIS POWER OF ROLLING THE EYES AND HIS HABIT OF TAKING LONG JUMPS FROM THE MUSIC-STOOL TO THE BOOK-CASE--AS RATHER A SEDENTARY CHARACTER
AND THERE WAS I
BUT MYRA LOVES HIM AS A MOTHER
THE PATRIOT THIS IS A TRUE STORY
THIS WAS HENRI'S
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT NUISANCE AS A SMALL BOY I WILL I SAY FERVENTLY I WILL SATISFIED BY MY PROMISE HE GIVES ME BACK MY SHIRT
DOUBLE-NINE TWO THREE ELSINORE
IT TAKES AT LEAST TEN LETTERS A DAY TO SATISFY US AND WE PREFER TO CATCH TEN DIFFERENT POSTS
THE REVEREND ARTHUR MANLEY A CLEVER YOUNG CLERGYMAN WITH A TASTE FOR GARDENING WAS TALKING IN ONE CORNER TO MISS PHIPPS A PRETTY GIRL OF SOME TWENTY SUMMERS
OR IS IT THE SARDINIAN WHITE-THROAT I WONDERED
YOU CAN JUST WRITE YOUR NAME IN IT OR YOU CAN BE FUNNY WHICHEVER YOU LIKE WHAT DO THEY USUALLY DO I ASKED
S FOR--FOR SISTER NOW YOU'RE GOING TO MUDDLE HIM MURMURED CELIA
PLEASANTLY ENTERTAINED AS USUAL BY D COMPANY
I WILL NOW RETIRE INTO THE LIBRARY AND CONSIDER WHAT THAT MESSAGE IS TO BE I PLACED THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA HANDY AND SAT DOWN AT MY DESK
WHEN WE ARRIVE YOU WILL INTRODUCE US AS YOUR FRIENDS MR AND MRS MANNERING
THE GODS OF OLD STILL GAZED UPON THE SCENE WHERE THIRTY YEARS AGONE THE LINES OF BILL AND ME AND JOHN WERE CAST IN PLEASANT PLACES
OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD BY SUPERHUMAN PLAY DO A HOLE IN BOGEY
HE FOR ONE WILL NEVER FORGET CHRISTMAS AT HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL
ARROWS OF--_DROP IT FIDO
THERE WERE EXALTED PERSONS IN THE REGIMENT CALLED LIEUTENANTS
FIRST WE MUST INTRODUCE SOME OF THE SQUIRE'S GUESTS TO OUR READERS
THEN COMES YOUR LAST QUESTION
BUT WE MIGHT RENT IT WHEN--WHEN HE DOESN'T WANT IT ANY MORE DEAR MR BARLOW I AMENDED HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIE NO THAT WOULDN'T DO EITHER
HIS COMPLETE LACK OF VANITY HIS THOUGHTFULNESS THE INTENSE RESERVE WHICH SO OBVIOUSLY INDICATED A STRONG CHARACTER HIS POWER OF LISTENING PLACIDLY TO EVEN THE MOST TEDIOUS OF LOCAL DIGNITARIES ALL THESE WERE VIRTUES OF WHICH PREVIOUS ROYAL VISITORS HAD GIVEN NO SIGN
AT LEAST SO THE WISE PEOPLE SAY BUT WE DON'T EAT LIMPETS NO BUT THEY CAN AMUSE US
FEVERISHLY HE SEIZED PEN AND PAPER AND BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT TO WRITE
OH-H-H SAID MYRA ENTRANCED
IN MY LESS HOPEFUL ONES I SEE MYSELF GOING INTO THE COUNTRY FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
SO COMMON CAME WITH ME TO FRANCE
I SHOULD BEGIN BY DWELLING ON THE PERSONNEL OF OUR LITTLE COMPANY
STILL YOU'D BETTER TELL ME NOW
IT SPELLS ALL RIGHT CELIA TRIED SPELLING IT
I KNOW I CAN DEPEND ON YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE MATHEMATICAL AND HE OPENED THE DOOR FOR ME
MALLORY THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE MUCH AS LAST YEAR EXCEPT THAT HER YOUNGEST BORN JOAN IS NOW FIVE AND CONSEQUENTLY RATHER MORE LIKELY TO WANDER IN THE WAY OF A CRICKET BALL OR FALL DOWN IN FRONT OF THE ROLLER THAN SHE WAS TWELVE MONTHS AGO
IT IS MAJOR THE MAJOR'S VOICE SANK TO A WHISPER
AND THE MAN WHO WORKS THE FIREPROOF SAFETY CURTAIN WOULD LOSE EVEN THE SMALL AMOUNT OF EXCITEMENT WHICH AT PRESENT ATTACHES TO HIS JOB
I THINK HE HAS SOME LITTLE EXCURSION TO PROPOSE
AND ME TO STAY ERE TILL I'M IT TOBY IT WILL SAVE TROUBLE IF I SAY AT ONCE THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HORSES
TO B.-H
YOU'RE TOO LATE FOR IT I GAVE MYSELF UP TO THOUGHT
SUDDENLY HE AWOKE TO FIND A STRANGE MAN STANDING OVER HIM
WELL WELL PERHAPS IN MY OWN LINE
I'M GOING TO SPELL IT SHE ANNOUNCED VERY DISTINCTLY DOWN THE TELEPHONE
YOU MUST GET THEM OR FATHER WILL NOT LET YOU MARRY ME ONCE MORE HE TREADS THE ROCKING WIRE
TWO HALLO
NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE NEXT TO IT A CROWN YES
I HAPPENED TO BE RATHER LATE FOR MY TRAIN AND AS I BOUGHT MY TICKET I ASKED THE CLERK WHAT TIME IT WAS
IN A REVOLVING BOOK-CASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPACIOUS LIBRARY WERE COUNTLESS TREASURED VOLUMES INCLUDING A COMPLETE EDITION OF THACKERAY
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MORE THAN THIRTY-SIX MYRA WHISPERED TO HIM
ISN'T THAT RIGHT MY MAN PERFECTLY CORRECT YOUR MAJESTY YOU SEE MY DEAR SAID THE KING COMPLACENTLY ONE SOON PICKS IT UP
I SAT FOR THAT HOUR AFTER HOUR DAY AFTER DAY FOR YOUR SAKE CELIA
BESIDES IT WAS LIKE THIS THAT WILLIAM TREWULLIAM HAD MET ANNE AGAIN AND HENRY POLHENERY HAD MET SARAH AND THOMAS PENTUMMAS HAD MET ALICE AND--WELL ANYHOW HE KNEW
TILL WEDNESDAY ANYHOW I INTERRUPTED THINKING IT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO CLINCH THE MATTER
NOT ON PROBATION ON MY LEFT SLEEVE I ALSO HAD A SINGLE STAR
THEY ARE GOING BACK TO POLWOLLOP
YOU SEE THAT I MAKE NOTHING OF IT HE SAID
MINE WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYBODY ELSE'S I SAID FIRMLY
BUT AFTER LISTENING TO CELIA FOR FIVE MINUTES I REALIZED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME HORRIBLE MISTAKE
IT TOOK US A LONG TIME AND I DOUBT IF WE GOT IT ALL IN EVEN SO FOR TWICE I FOUND MYSELF SHAKING HANDS WITH SIMPSON
WHAT GENIUS LOVES I MEAN THE PEOPLE SHY AT YET NO ONE EVER SHIED AT SALMON MAYONNAISE
AT CLACTON-ON-SEA LOOK HERE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
AND WHEN THEY SEE OUR LUGGAGE LET'S GO BACK I SUGGESTED SUDDENLY NERVOUS
WELL HAVE YOU ANSWERED IT YET TO TELL THE TRUTH I'VE QUITE FORGOTTEN THE WORD THAT--OH I REMEMBER NOW
THIS SO UNNERVED SIMPSON THAT HE LET THE THING OFF WITHOUT ANY FURTHER WARNING BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO GET OUR EXPRESSIONS NATURAL
YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING SAID THE KING TO HIS DAUGHTER
LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGECRAFT IS AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY IF YOU EVER READ YOUR SHAKESPEARE"--AND NO DRAMATIST SHOULD DESPISE THE WORKS OF ANOTHER DRAMATIST
NOW WE'RE OFF SAID THE GODS IN OLYMPUS IN DIEDELDORF THE CAPITAL OF ESSENLAND THE LEADER-WRITERS PROCEEDED TO REMOVE THEIR COATS
CELIA IT IS YOUR RONALD
IT'S VERY UGLY ANNOUNCED CELIA
FOR HINDENBURG GERMANY WITH A DIABOLICAL SMILE HE SEALED THE ENVELOPE UP RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED SECOND-LIEUTENANT LORD SMITH TO BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
I PROMISED THE GIRL YOU KNOW I SAT DOWN WORKED IT OUT HASTILY ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE AND MADE IT A YARD AND A HALF
TELL ME AS A SECRET PETER'S NEARLY TWO SAID DAHLIA
I DON'T THINK MR BARLOW IS THAT SORT OF MAN I SAID
IT IS RATHER JOLLY WE SAID IT TEN MORE TIMES EACH AND IT SEEMED THE ONLY POSSIBLE NAME FOR IT
HOME NOTES VI
NOW LOOK THERE AND I POINTED WITH A PENCIL WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU SEE TWENTY-TWO
DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS OVER BUT ABSOLUTELY THRILLED WITH MY DISCOVERY I HURRIED BACK TO CELIA
PERHAPS ON MIDSUMMER EVE AT ANY RATE I AM SURE THAT IT IS THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH TO POST A LETTER TO FATHER CHRISTMAS
IT INFORMED THE MANAGER THAT I HAD ARRIVED IN LONDON FROM FRANCE AND SHOULD BE TROUBLING THEM AGAIN SHORTLY LONDON BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES AN EXPENSIVE PLACE
SO MUCH BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION
OUR WINDOW-BOX--OUR GARDEN IS ALREADY FULL
WE WERE JUST GOING INTO ACTION AND I HAPPENED TO TURN ROUND TO MY MEN AND SAY NOW THEN BOYS GIVE EM BEANS TO MY AMUSEMENT ONE OF THEM REPLIED SMARTLY HOW MANY BLUE BEANS MAKE FIVE WE WERE ALL SO INTERESTED IN WORKING IT OUT THAT WE NEVER GOT INTO ACTION AT ALL BUT THAT'S EASY SAID THE PROFESSOR
THEN A LOOK OF GRIM DETERMINATION CAME INTO HIS EYES
BUT I THINK THAT THE FEAT IN WHICH HE TAKES MOST PRIDE WAS PERFORMED ONE VERY EARLY SUMMER MORNING
BUT ON TUESDAY EVENING--ITS LAST HOURS WITH US--I HAD TO CONFESS TO A CERTAIN MELANCHOLY
IN THE LIST OF THE SOCIETY'S LECTURES SENT TO ME THERE WAS HARDLY ONE WHOSE TITLE DID NOT IMPRESS THE IMAGINATION IN ADVANCE
RE-ENTER BUTLER AND THREE FOOTMEN WHO REMOVE THE TEA-THINGS
OF COURSE I MUSTN'T MEET THE AUTHORITY AGAIN BECAUSE YOU MAY BE PRETTY SURE THAT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS BOOKS HE LOOKED UP BLACKMAN'S WARBLER AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH ANIMAL
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ARCHIE
FIND HER GET BACK THE DOCUMENTS FOR ME AND SHE IS YOURS AT THAT MOMENT A TERRIBLE CRY RANG THROUGH THE SHIP MAN OVERBOARD PUSHING OVER MR BELLINGHAM AND RUNNING ON DECK RICHARD SAW THAT A WOMAN AND HER BABY WERE BATTLING FOR LIFE IN THE SHARK-INFESTED WATERS
IT WENT
ONE MORNING ON THE TRAINING GROUND WHEN FIXING BAYONETS HE FOUND THE FATAL DAY ALREADY ROUND AND EVEN AS HE FIXED HE DECIDED THEN AND THERE TO STATE TO SERGEANT BROWN AT ANY RATE HIS LONGING TO CONGRATULATE HIS SIRE ON BEING SIXTY
IT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE BOER WAR EVERYBODY LISTENED EAGERLY
HE'LL BE HERE DIRECTLY SAID SIMPSON FROM THE LITTLE TABLE FOR TWO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GANGWAY
MARY IT WAS JOHN SPEAKING
WITH A SHOUT HE DASHED INTO THE MILL
PROBABLY I HAVE WRITTEN TWO
AND AS HALF-WAY THROUGH DINNER THE MAN ON HER OTHER SIDE TURNED TO TALK TO HER SHE SHOT AN URGENT QUESTION AT HIM
AND FOUND HIMSELF ALONE
IT'S ONE OF THE STOCK REMARKS ONE MAKES TO WOMEN IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP THEM AMUSED
THE ENCHANTED CASTLE THERE ARE WARM DAYS IN LONDON WHEN EVEN A WINDOW-BOX FAILS TO CHARM AND ONE LONGS FOR THE MORE OPEN SPACES OF THE COUNTRY
THEY REMAINED HANDSOME BUT AWKWARD WHICH WAS WHY WOMEN LOVED THEM SO
YES IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD GO
WHAT WE GARDENERS REALLY WANT IS RAIN
D AND HE--THANK GOD!--HAS THE O.B.E
QUITE IT'S INSTANTANEOUS YOU KNOW SAID MYRA GENTLY
IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN A MYSTERY TO HER FRIENDS WHY LADY MARY HAD NEVER MARRIED
THE DOOR OPENED AND HIS WIFE THE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT CAME INTO THE LIBRARY
THE USUAL PURSUIT FOLLOWED
WHAT DO WE WANT TO SAY EXACTLY DEAR MR BARLOW--MAY WE HAVE YOUR HOUSE YES SMILED CELIA BUT I'M AFRAID WE CAN HARDLY ASK FOR IT
LET US I SAY MEET AT LUNCH
LORD ARTHUR ANXIOUSLY
LET US BE SILLY I SCRATCHED IN THE ROCK THE GOAL TO WHICH I WAS URGING MY LIMPET AND TOOK OUT MY WATCH
YOU MAY GUESS THE RIVER
I WOULD CONCEDE HIM SHORT PUTTS WHICH I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN MISSING MYSELF
THE SUN MAY SHINE AT COLCHESTER THE RAIN MAY RAIN AT PENGE
OUT OF THE NETHERMOST BONDS OF NIGHT OUT OF THE GLOOM WHERE THE BATS WINGS BRUSH ME FREE FROM THE CREPITOUS DOUBTS WHICH CRUSH ME FORTH I FARE TO THE COOL SUNLIGHT
AND AS WE DIDN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF ON PROBATION CELIA PUT A FEW STITCHES IN THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE PERMANENT
CHESTNUTS ROANS BAY RUMS--I KNOW NOTHING OF ALL THESE
AND THEN VERY RELUCTANTLY I GOT UP TO GO
HIS RIVAL JOHNNY AS I THINK OF HIM DOES NOT CONDUCT AS YET
DAHLIA DECOYS THE CHIEF MUCILAGE
HE SQUEAKED
THIS IS VERY GRAVE NEWS GERTIE HE SAID
HOW SWEET OF YOU AND SHE TOOK MY PARCEL FROM ME
ATTENDEZ UN MOMENT
YOU'LL BE SORRY AFTERWARDS I WARNED HER WHEN IT TURNS OUT TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN THAT HE HAS HAD HIS HAIR CUT BUT EVEN IF IT IS I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULDN'T BE EXCITED AT SEEING MY ONLY BROTHER AGAIN--NOT TO MENTION SISTER-IN-LAW THEN LET'S MOVE I SAID
THEN I SPRANG OUT GAVE THE MAN A COIN AND HASTENED INTO THE BUILDING
UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO BELIEVE ME IT IS NOT MUCH GOOD MY GOING ON
JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR TWO BRIDGE TABLES OR FOUR PICQUET PAIRS OR EIGHT PATIENCE SINGLES
AND A LITTLE LOWER DOWN THAT IT WAS OBJECTIVE RATHER THAN SUBJECTIVE I POINTED OUT THAT IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE MAJOR THEME HE WAS A NEO-ROMANTICIST BUT I SUGGESTED THAT ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD NOTHING TO LEARN FROM THE RUSSIANS--OR THE RUSSIANS HAD NOTHING TO LEARN FROM HIM
AND ALL NOTICED HOW LOVINGLY THE PRINCESS REGARDED HIM AND HOW HE SMILED UPON HER
TRUE THERE WERE EPISODES IN HIS PAST LIFE OF WHICH IN LATER YEARS HE COULD NOT WHOLLY APPROVE
I SAY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTERESTED IN PROBLEMS WELL BECAUSE I'VE GOT RATHER A TRICKY CHESS PROBLEM HERE I CAN'T DO HE PRODUCED HIS POCKET CHESS-BOARD
TO SAY MORE AT THIS STAGE WOULD BE TO BRING ABOUT A EUROPEAN CONFLICT COFFEE THOMAS SAID MYRA
STAY
SHE FOLLOWED WONDERING
BUT OF COURSE THE EGGS ARE MORE SPECKLED I ADDED CASUALLY
IT WAS WHISPERED THAT ALREADY SHE HAD REFUSED MORE THAN ONE ARCHBISHOP THREE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETORS AND A COUPLE OF DUKES
ISN'T ENGLAND THE ALLY OF THE ALLY OF THE ALLY OF THE COUNTRY WHICH HOLDS THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN MARKSLAND AND FELICIA BUT IF ANY OF THEM THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING STUPID OR UNJUST OR THEIR PRESTIGE SAID THE GODS GRAVELY TRYING NOT TO LAUGH
BUT THAT'S WHY
YOU'VE GIVEN THE HOLE UP I PROTESTED
HERE WE ARE SEVEN YEARS LATER AND I AM STILL AT IT
HUSH
FOR HIS TAIL CONTINUED TO BE NOTHING BUT A RAT'S TAIL AND HIS BODY TO BE NOTHING BUT A FAT TUB AND HIS HEAD TO BE ALMOST THE HEAD OF ANY LITTLE PUPPY IN THE WORLD
I SAW THAT I MUST EXPLAIN IT TO HER
I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A LONG TALK WITH THE SECRETARY
THAT IS THE ONLY WEAK SPOT IN ONE OF THE MOST BAFFLING TRICKS EVER PRACTISED BY THE AMATEUR PRESTIDIGITATOR TO USE THE WORD FOR THE LAST TIME IT WILL MAKE A FITTING CLIMAX TO YOUR EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT--AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH WILL ENSURE YOU ANOTHER WARM INVITATION NEXT YEAR WHEN THE FESTIVE SEASON COPYRIGHT COMES UPON US ONCE AGAIN
WELL I WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED IT TO JOHNNY
IT WAS EARLY IN 1871 NOR LIKE THAT
THE SAME LIKE AS IT USED TO BE THE SAME OLD MARKETS SAME OLD CROWD THE SAME OLD MARRERS SAME OLD ME BUT ER AS PROUD AS PROUD
ASK HIM TO RING UP HIS MOTHER SAID THE PORTER
AND BY A COTTAGE I MEAN NOT FOUR PLAIN ROOMS AND A KITCHEN BUT ONE SURPRISING ROOM OPENING INTO ANOTHER
BUT THIS MORNING SHE HAD AN IDEA
THE BATH-MAT SHE SAID SURPRISED
JACQUES WHO HAD BEEN GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING HASTILY SUBSTITUTED SERPENT I KNOW YOU CRIED GASPARD
THE FATAL GIFT PEOPLE SAY TO ME SOMETIMES OH YOU KNOW WOOLMAN DON'T YOU I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DO AND AFTER THE SILENCE THAT ALWAYS ENSUES I ADD IF YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST HIM PLEASE GO ON YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THE SIGH OF RELIEF THAT GOES UP
YES SAID BILLY
SIMPSON AS OUR HOST SHALL PUT THE MONEY ON
NOBODY CAN DENY THAT THESE WERE SERIOUS BLOTS ON HIS CAREER BUT IT WAS FELT IN THE TRENCHES THAT HIS SKILL WITH THE RIFLE PARTIALLY ATONED FOR THEM
HALLO OLD CHAP
I KNOW SHE WENT HOME FEELING A LITTLE DISTURBED
THERE I SAID NOW THAT WAS A CHIFF-CHAFF THE EARNEST-LOOKING GIRL REMARKED SILLY CREATURE THAT IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE THE OTHER ONE BUT NOBODY TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HER
THE SUNNY SIDE BY A
YOU SEND YOUR INSTRUCTOR UP IN YOUR PLACE
BUT OF COURSE IF AND THEN THEY BEGIN
AND I MY INTIMATES ALLOW HAVE LOST THE TASTE FOR BULL'S-EYES NOW AND BALDNESS DECORATES THE BROW OF BILL OUR ELDER BROTHER
OH THE DEARS CRIED MYRA
A LITTLE ORCHARD WAS RUNNING WILD ON THE WEST
AND STILL HE STOOD THERE SAYING PROUDLY I AM INNOCENT GO SAID THE COLONEL POINTING WITH HIS SWORD TO THE DOOR
JENNY IS ONLY NINE BUT SHE HAS BEEN TO THE SEASIDE BEFORE AND KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
NEXT I HAVE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU MR THOMAS TODD AN AGREEABLE YOUNG BACHELOR
NO I SAID SLOWLY NO IT WOULDN'T AND I TELEGRAPHED AN APPEAL TO CELIA FOR HELP
BOBBY ENTERS UPON THE COMING SEASON WITH CONFIDENCE AS HE THINKS THERE IS A CHANCE OF MY BOWLING TO HIM TOO
BUT BEFORE YOU GO THERE IS JUST ONE THING
I'M AFRAID HE HAD A BAD NIGHT
IV
IV
BY THE TIME MR BELLINGHAM HAD REGAINED HIS SENSES THE THIEF WAS AWAY
YOU SEE HOW EASY IT IS
ARE THEY MAKING MORE GENERALS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GENERALS
SO I CLIMBED UP IT MUST BE RATHER DIFFICULT CLIMBING UP AT NIGHT THOUGHT DAHLIA
BLACKMAIL'S WARBLER IS OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR THE CHIFF-CHAFF EVEN BY SO-CALLED EXPERTS"--AND I TURNED TO THE AUTHORITY AND ADDED HAVE ANOTHER SANDWICH WON'T YOU?"--"PARTICULARLY SO OF COURSE DURING THE BREEDING SEASON
PROBABLY THIS WAS HE
OF COURSE I SAID FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ORCHIDS AND LED THE WAY BACK TO THE GERANIUMS AGAIN
I HAD THE WAR OFFICE ON MY SIDE SO I COULD AFFORD TO BE FIRM
THAT GAVE ME ABOUT SIXTY YEARS TO DO SOMETHING IN
HOWEVER AS ALL THE RATS SEEM TO HAVE ROTTENED WE ARE MUCH AS WE WERE ROTTENED WAS MISPRINTED RATTENED WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO SPOIL THE JOKE
COMMISH OR BE A RAG-TIME SAILOR
FOR YEARS THE PIANOLA WAS NOT PLAYED BY EITHER OF US
I HAD SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF THE WORD ADOBE MY STORY SEEMED TO NEED IT SOMEWHERE
YOU HAVE BLANKTOWN THEN AS THE DEPOSITORY OF CELIA'S FORTUNE
ONE ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER
IT SEEMS TO ME VERY CLEVER OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND SO EXACTLY WHAT HE IS SAYING HUMPH SAID FREDERICK FEELING THAT IT WAS ABOUT ACORN TIME AGAIN
AND THAT IN SHORT IS HOW I WAS ENTANGLED IN THE BUSINESS
WHEREUPON HE ROWED ACROSS THE RIVER AND POURED HIS REVOLVER INTO THE ESSENLAND FLAG WHICH WAS FLYING OVER THE FORT
IT WAS BROKEN TO US BY DAHLIA WHO AT SIMPSON'S URGENT REQUEST TOOK UP THE POSITION OF LADY OF THE HOUSE AND FORTHWITH RECEIVED THE FLOWING CONFIDENCES OF THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE WAS BACK IN THE DEAR OLD UNIFORM AND THE WEDDING OF SECOND-LIEUTENANT LORD SMITH TO ROSAMUND BLOWHARD WAS ONE OF THE EVENTS OF THE SEASON
STOPES--OF COURSE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU SLEPT SO WELL HE TRIED TO GET BACK INTO MY BED I WAS A LITTLE DAZED EXPLAINED SIMPSON HASTILY AND I HADN'T GOT MY SPECTACLES STILL YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THOMAS THERE OF COURSE I DID SEE HIM AS SOON AS I GOT IN AND THEN I REMEMBERED I WAS UP ABOVE
SHE MUST WAIT
AND THEN IF HE SEES THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY AWKWARDNESS ABOUT HIM HE CAN PRETEND HE'S COME ON THE WRONG NIGHT AND APOLOGIZE AND GO HOME AGAIN IF THOMAS GOES I GO SAID MYRA DRAMATICALLY
WHEN HE AWOKE IT WAS TO FIND HIMSELF IN THE XTH BED OF THE YTH BASE HOSPITAL
SHE HAS JUST READ IN THE PAPER ABOUT A MINE THAT FLOATED ASHORE AND EXPLODED
BUT THERE'S A NEW WHITE WAISTCOAT
AND THEN ARCHIE GOT UP
ALLOW ME TO DISILLUSION YOU
IT'S A VERY GLOOMY PLAY BY IBSEN AND WHENEVER IT'S SIMPLY MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I LOOK UP AND SEE MENTONE ON THE LEFT MONTE CARLO ON THE RIGHT--I MEAN I SEE ALL THE LOVELINESS ROUND ME AND THEN I KNOW THE WORLD ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL SHE PUT HER BOOK DOWN
WE'RE FLABBY HE REPEATED
COME INTO THE BATH-ROOM A MOMENT I SAID AND I LED THE WAY
DETAILS WERE SOON SETTLED
IT IS THE LAST TIME BECAUSE THIS SORT OF WRITING DEPENDS LARGELY UPON THE IRRESPONSIBILITY AND HIGH SPIRITS OF YOUTH FOR ITS SUCCESS AND I WANT TO STOP BEFORE MAY I SAY BEFORE THE HIGH SPIRITS BECOME MECHANICAL AND THE IRRESPONSIBILITY A TRICK
FORTH TO A WORLD WHERE THE WIND SWEEPS CLEAN WHERE THE SMOOTH-LIMBED ASH TO THE BLUE STANDS BARE AND THE GOSSAMER SPREADS HER OPALLED WARE AND JONES IS CATCHING THE 8.15
OH SAID THE KING
FOR HINDENBURG GERMANY THE COLONEL AND THE OTHER OFFICERS DREW THEIR SWORDS THE RANK AND FILE FIXED BAYONETS
TRUE THE LECTURE-ROOM WILL BE LIT UP--A SMALL COMPENSATION--BUT NOT FOR LONG
EVEN THOUGH WE START WITH PINK GERANIUMS NOW WE MAY HAVE--ER--CALCEOLARIAS NEXT YEAR
NOW THERE IS SOMETHING VERY CHARMING IN A PROPER MODESTY ABOUT ONE'S ATTAINMENTS BUT IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE ATTAINMENTS SHOULD BE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED FIRST
IF THE WEATHER PERMITS I MAY HAVE THE CROQUET THINGS OUT ONE AFTERNOON AND TRY A ROUND OR POSSIBLY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BOWL SAID BOBBY RUDELY
SO FRIENDS ACQUAINTANCES YES AND EVEN STRANGERS I BEG YOU NOW TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE
WAIT TILL WE GET HOME IT WAS COOLER NOW AND WE WANDERED THROUGH THE TENTS CHATTING PATRONIZINGLY TO THE STALL-KEEPER WHENEVER WE CAME TO PINK GERANIUMS
DEAR SIR,--I HAVE NO CHILD
ALMOST AS DIFFICULT AS I TURNED TO CELIA
IN FACT YOU MIGHT WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT AND AS YOU SEE I HAVE
BUT OH I SIMPLY LOVE THE WAY OUR ORGAN-GRINDER PLAYS ALL DAY
THEY ARE GOING DOWN
IN TWO PACKETS MY LOVE HE ADDED IN CASE ALGERNON AND I GET SEPARATED HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY STARTED OFF TOGETHER IN HIGH SPIRITS
BUT IT DID SEEM FUNNY BECAUSE SHE USED TO BE OLDER THAN ME AT SCHOOL ISN'T SHE STILL OH NO
BUT WHY ARE YOU SO MORBID ABOUT YOURSELF SUDDENLY I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID
HE PUT IT IN HIS POCKET WITH THE INTENTION OF GIVING IT TO THE DRIVER WHEN HE GOT OUT BUT QUITE NATURALLY FORGOT
IT'S THE HALLMARK RIGHT
GASPARD WALKED TOWARDS IT HOPING FOR A LITTLE CONVERSATION
AND FINALLY WE INVESTED IT IN THE BLANKTOWN ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY
AT ELEVEN-STONE-EIGHT I HAD TO GET OFF AGAIN IN ORDER TO ATTEND TO THE BATH WHICH WAS IN DANGER OF OVERFLOWING
DEAR MR BARLOW ER--DEAR MR BARLOW--WE YES IT WILL BE RATHER DIFFICULT
WHEN MYRA MARRIED ME SHE PROMISED TO LOVE HONOUR AND WRITE ALL MY THANK-YOU-VERY-MUCH LETTERS FOR ME FOR WE AGREED BEFORE THE CEREMONY THAT THE WORD OBEY SHOULD MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN THAT
QUITE STILL PLEASE
WILLY AS PERHAPS YOU KNOW DOES NOT PLAY ANY INSTRUMENT HIMSELF
MY FRIEND I ARRANGE IT ALL
THAT'S THE CARDEWS VILLA I SAID
THIS ANNOYED ME
WHY ON EARTH SHOULDN'T I ASK HIM I HAPPENED TO TURN UP JUST THEN
SILLY KID SIX SAID THE SQUIRE
EVEN THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SERGEANT-MAJOR SIGNED YOURS EVER HENRY WHICH STOOD UPON HIS DESK BROUGHT HIM NO COMFORT
NAME YOUR WEAPONS SUBMARINES SAID JACQUES AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
THIS SAID SMITH IS A SERIOUS GAME AND WE MUST PLAY ALL OUT
WAS I TO SAY A SINGLE WORD TO DISTURB THE DELICATE BALANCE OF SUCH A BOY'S MIND
A WADI RAN BY THE SIDE OF IT
POLTROON JACQUES PICKED UP HIS GLASS AND POURED THE WINE OF THE COUNTRY OVER HIS FRIEND'S HEAD
SMITH THEN CAME TO TERMS AND AGREED TO SHARE THE CUP WITH ME FOR THE FIRST YEAR
THIS GALLANT FELLOW HERE WHOM I NOW KNOW TO BE LORD SMITH SAVED MY LIFE
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT OUR CONSUMING ANXIETY WOULD HAVE TO BE RELIEVED VERY SPEEDILY
YOU MUST TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THEM NOW WE'VE GOT YOU HERE AND ALL THIS BECAUSE OF ONE MISERABLE CUCKOO
OF ALL THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICERS IN THE NTH BATTALION LORD SMITH WAS PERHAPS THE MOST BRILLIANT
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO TELL YOU SIR SAID THE MAJOR THAT I ASKED LORD SMITH TO KEEP AN EYE UPON THE DOCUMENT DURING MY ABSENCE
R
HOWEVER THE NEXT DAY WAS EVEN WARMER
WE GROUPED OURSELVES PICTURESQUELY
WELL JOHNNY'S FUTURE COULD LOOK AFTER ITSELF NOW
FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF A NARROW STREET CROWDED WITH LORRIES HE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE FLUNG I THINK THAT'S THE EXPRESSION)--FLUNG ME THE REINS AND SAID JUST WAIT HERE WHILE I SEE THE MAYOR A MOMENT THE MAJOR'S HORSE I CAN DESCRIBE QUITE SHORTLY--A NASTY BIG BLACK HORSE
HE HAS LEARNT HIS LESSON
I COULD NOT TAKE HIM RED AND UNDRAPED PAST THE HALL-PORTER PAST ALL THE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO MIGHT SPRING OUT AT ME ON THE STAIRS
I WANT LOTS OF THAT YOU MUST GET PHYLLIS TO BOWL TO YOU I SAID WITH DETACHMENT
HERE'S TO THE HIGHEST SCORE OF THE RABBITS WICKET-KEEPER
NO M
SAME OLD SCRAMBLE UP THE LINE SAME OLD ORSE-BOX SAME OLD STROR SAME OLD WEATHER WET OR FINE SAME OLD BLOOMING WAR
THAT MEANS THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS DELIGHTED TO MEET SO BEAUTIFUL AND DISTINGUISHED A PRINCESS HE TURNED TO HI-YOU
AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN
I SEEMED TO HAVE DISCOVERED THE SECRET OF SUCCESSFUL REVUE-WRITING
HE HAD SEEN HER THE MOMENT SHE CAME IN AT THE DOOR
MY DEAR OLD CHAP I WAS FRIGHTFULLY SORRY
ANNE-MARIE OUR FIRST AND GETTING ON SO NICELY WITH HER FRENCH RAPIDLY SHE EXPLAINED WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH IT ANNE-MARIE'S LOOK OF INTENSE RAPTURE SLOWLY STRAIGHTENING ITSELF TO ONE OF ORDINARY GRATITUDE AS THE FINANCIAL STANDING OF THE OTHER NINE IN THE BUSINESS BECAME CLEAR
ONCE MORE HE RE-CROSSES WITH THE PAPERS ON HIS BACK
HE WAS ABOUT TO TEST ME
I WANT THREE OF ICE I SAID WITH AN AIR
AND THERE'S ANOTHER THING--WE DON'T KNOW HIS INITIALS OR EVEN IF HE'S A MR PERHAPS HE'S A KNIGHT OR A--A DUKE
ONCE MORE HE RETIRED TO THE VALISE FOR WE WERE MAKING NOW FOR A VILL--FOR A HEAP OF BRICKS NEAR THE RIVER
AND SO THE BUSINESS HAS GONE ON
THERE NOW SAID MY HOSTESS WHAT'S THAT I LISTENED WITH MY HEAD ON ONE SIDE
I SAID WE'D BE SIX BUT SIX IN A LETTER IS MUCH SMALLER THAN SIX OF US LIKE THIS
ARCHIE LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT THOMAS
DID YOU GIVE THAT MESSAGE TO MISS BLOWHARD YES SIR
RICHARD HENRY NODS TWO OR THREE TIMES
CADDIE MY DRIVER PLEASE
I THINK I SEE HE SAID
ANYHOW THEY WOULDN'T BE SECULAR RATS LIKE THE ONES I MADE MY JOKE ABOUT I DON'T MIND WHETHER THE RATS ARE SECULAR OR CIRCULAR SAID CELIA BUT DO GET THEM IN SOON WELL I TRIED
HAVE SOME OF OURS SAID MYRA KINDLY HOLDING OUT THE POT
WHEN I JOINED THE ARMY CELIA WAS INCONSOLABLE
HE--ER--THAT IS TO SAY--ER--LLOYD GEORGE YES IS THAT THE ANSWER SAID OUR HOST RATHER SURPRISED
BUT ON READING IT THROUGH AFTERWARDS I SAW AT ONCE THAT THE FIRST TWO SENTENCES WERE OUT OF PLACE IN AN ARTICLE THAT OBVIOUSLY OUGHT TO BE CALLED THE LAST SWALLOW
AND THEN EVEN AS HE WAS IN MID-AIR HE REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING
I HAVE FORTY-THREE STROKES IN HAND
BUT NOBODY BOTHERED US
HIS SECOND A SUDDEN NICK HAD SET IT ROLLING DOWN THE HILL TO THE GREEN
HOW MUCH ICE DO YOU WANT HE SAID PROMPTLY
AND THE NAME OF THE HOUSE IS STOPES SHE REPEATED IT TO HERSELF WITH A FROWN
AT ANY RATE HE NODS SEVERAL TIMES THERE IS MORE GIRLISH LAUGHTER MORE BUZZ AND MORE DEAF-AND-DUMB LANGUAGE
ALL BUT PRIVATE SMITHLORD
GOT THAT
SO FAR I HAVE ALWAYS MANAGED TO AVOID--SO FAR I HAVE BEEN UNAVOIDABLY PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING ON THESE OCCASIONS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROCEDURE IS AS FOLLOWS
YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO WIN THE WAR IF YOU GO ON LIKE THAT WELL YOU READ IT SHE SAID HANDING ME THE PAPER
IF BY MEANS OF A RAKING DRIVE AND FOUR PERFECT BRASSIES AT THE SIXTH HE MANAGED TO GET ONE UP FOR A MOMENT THEN AT THE SHORT SEVENTH A SCREAMING IRON AND THREE CONSUMMATE APPROACHES WOULD MAKE ME SQUARE AGAIN
I HAD A SORT OF INSTINCT THAT HE WOULD ASK ME THAT
WE GAVE MRS HERBERT THE SECOND THE FEARING TO TRUST HER WITH ANYTHING MORE ALARMING AND IN ORDER TO KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY WE GAVE THE OTHER THE TO HERBERT WHO WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR BACK OUR HOSTESS HAD LAST AND MRS PETER HAD THAT ALL THIS BEING SETTLED OUR HOST WAS ADMITTED INTO HIS SMOKING-ROOM AGAIN
HOWEVER HE GOT RIGHT THROUGH IT AT LAST AFTER HARKING BACK NO MORE THAN TWICE AND I SAT DOWN TO MY WORK AGAIN
THIS FREQUENTLY HAPPENS TO ME UPSTAIRS
DON'T YOU KNOW FROM ALL THE HUMOROUS ARTICLES YOU'VE EVER READ THAT IF YOU TRY TO LOSE ANYTHING THEN YOU NEVER CAN
JACK ELLISON WAS PARTICULARLY EMPHATIC FOR THE BEAUTIFUL MISS HOLDEN HAD PROMISED TO BE HIS WIFE
IN THE EVENT OF BOTH CRASHING THE ONE WHO CRASHED LAST WOULD BE DEEMED THE VICTOR
AND IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THE LAST BIT YOU'LL ACTUALLY HEAR THE HORSES LIMPING SOMETHING LIKE THAT I WOULD SAY
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE MEANT BY AS TIME IS SO SHORT I DON'T KNOW
OUR FIRST POET"--HERE HE PUTS ON HIS GLASSES AND READS FROM A PAPER ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HIM--"IS MR SYDNEY WORPLE OF WHOM YOU--ER--HAVE--ER--DOUBTLESS ALL HEARD
BLACKMAN'S WARBLER
GOOD-BYE HE SAID TO MYRA HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'S SEVENTEEN ALL RIGHT
THERE WAS ONLY ONE MISPRINT
HIS HEART BEAT TUMULTUOUSLY
IT IS TOO MUCH FOR SIMPSON
HAVE YOU BEEN TO ANY THEATRES LATELY DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO TO THE FLOWER SHOW I ASKED
THIS IS A CO-OPERATIVE JOB
IT IS DIFFICULT TO WITHHOLD OUR SYMPATHY FROM HIM
BY ALL MEANS I SAID WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET A BOOK ABOUT BIRDS DOWN FROM LONDON
I KNOW A CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY WHO MADE BIG BOMBS FOR THE R.F.C AND COLLARED A LOT OF L S
AND I DON'T LIKE TELLING STRANGE MEN IN SHOPS PRIVATE AND SPECIAL THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES
I WISH YOU'D HURRY UP
IT WAS COMFORTING TO THINK THAT WHEREVER THEY STOOD THEY WOULD BE WITHIN REACH OF HIS HAND AS HE LAY IN BED
RATS ARE FAUNA NOT FLORA
WHAT IS THE CONNEXION BETWEEN MARS AND LIMPETS
I SHALL HAVE TO ASK THE SECRETARY BEFOREHAND I BEGAN AGAIN
WE SHALL NOT BE ACCUSED OF EXAGGERATION IF WE SAY THAT ESSENLAND WOULD LOSE AND RIGHTLY LOSE HER PRESTIGE IN THE EYES OF EUROPE IF SHE LET THIS AFFRONT PASS UNNOTICED
AND THEN OUTSIDE TO JUMP INTO A CAB AND TAKE THE WINDS THE COLD EAST WINDS OF MARCH WITH BEAUTY
THOMAS COMES AT THE END
THAT IS ALL THAT IS ALL THAT I SEEK
BINGO HAD GOODWOOD LO TO SUPPORT HIM--IN TWO PLACES
DO WE RECOGNIZE HIM
AFTER ALL SAYS ONE GUEST TO ANOTHER WHY SHOULDN'T A TADPOLE MAKE LOVE AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE I THINK SAYS HER NEIGHBOUR THAT THE IDEA IS OF YOUTH TRYING VAINLY TO EXPRESS ITSELF--OR AM I THINKING OF CATERPILLARS
MY FAVOURITE SUBALTERN HE WENT ON WITH HIS HAND ON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
THEN I SHALL KEEP A VISITORS BOOK JUST TO SHOW YOU SO THAT WAS HOW THE D COMPANY VISITORS BOOK WAS INAUGURATED
BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE A SPECIALTY OF THEM
THEN SHE'S JOLLY WELL SPOILT MY STORY THE ONE ABOUT THE WATTLES YES TUT-TUTTLES SAID CELIA FRIVOLOUSLY
THUS IN THIS PLAY WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AN EASY WAY OF AVOIDING HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY WOULD BE FOR OPHELIA TO SPEAK FIRST
I USED TO LOOK AT MY STARS SOMETIMES ONE ON EACH SLEEVE
AND SOME SAY THAT HI-YOU HAD PLANNED IT ALL FROM THE BEGINNING BUT I SAY NOT
SHE SAYS TEARFULLY THAT I REMIND HER OF A HERRING
IT'S ALL OVER
AT LEAST THE DOCTOR WHO SLAPPED ME ABOUT YESTERDAY SAID THAT I MUST AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD
THE COLONEL GAVE ONE GLANCE AT THE ENVELOPE AND THEN WITH FIRE FLASHING FROM HIS EYES HELD IT UP FOR ALL TO SEE
OR HE'S DISCOVERED A NEW WAY OF PUTTING OR--I SAY I DIDN'T KNOW ARCHIE AND DAHLIA WERE IN TOWN THEY AREN'T
HE DIDN'T
EVEN THE MOST RECKLESS TOWN MAJOR WOULD HAVE BLENCHED AT THE IDEA
IS IT THE SAUCE WHICH PUTS THE BRAND OF CAM ON EACH MADDENING DISH
I'M HARD OF HEARING RATHER SO CHADD THAT PROMISING RECRUIT STOOD TO ATTENTION CLICKED HIS BOOT AND BELLOWED WITH HIS BEST SALUTE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY FATHER THE VISITORS BOOK AS MAN OF THE WORLD SAID BLAKE STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT OF FIVE FOOT THREE AND SPEAKING WITH THE WISDOM OF NINETEEN YEARS I SAY THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE
AFTER ALL THERE WAS A DISTINGUISHED PRECEDENT
ANYWAY DR JOHN BULL'S MASTERPIECE WILL RISE NO MORE THROUGH THE CEILING OF THE FLAT BELOW
WHICH OF US IS MORE LIKELY TO REQUIRE A HORSE AND THE SNIPING OFFICER HE WENT ON DREAMILY
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HE'D FALL OUT BUT THOMAS DEAR SURELY SAMUEL'S JUST FALLING-OUT-OF-BED NOISE WOULDN'T WAKE YOU UP SAID MYRA
SIXPENNYWORTH I SAID FEELING SUDDENLY THAT CELIA'S THREEPENNYWORTH SOUNDED RATHER PALTRY
IT'S RATHER FUN PETER AND HIS WIFE WHO KNEW THE GAME AGREED
I SHALL OUT-BISH THE MILDEST BISHOP
MONDAY--HOSPITABLY RECEIVED BY D COMPANY AND MUCH ENJOYED THE MESS PRESIDENT'S AMUSING CONVERSATION
TOBY OF COURSE KNOWS MUCH MORE ABOUT MEN THAN I DO ABOUT HORSES AND NO DOUBT HE DESCRIBES ME PROFESSIONALLY TO HIS COLLEAGUES AS A FLEA-BITTEN FELLOW STANDING ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOOFS
IT WAS A FIERCE FIGHT WHILE IT LASTED AND I WAS SORRY WHEN IT WAS OVER BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME I BEGAN TO FEEL AT HOME WITH MY STORY
FOR INSTANCE IF THE NUMBERS WERE 13 AND 17 THEN 13 MULTIPLIED BY 17 IS--LET'S SEE THIRTEEN SEVENS ARE--THIRTEEN SEVENS--SEVEN THREES ARE TWENTY-ONE SEVEN TIMES ONE IS--WELL LOOK HERE LET'S SUPPOSE THE NUMBERS ARE 10 AND 17
LET ME THEREFORE SEE YOURS AGAIN IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL MAKE ME THINK MORE KINDLY OF THEIRS THEY MET POURED WINE OVER EACH OTHER AND PARTED
MRS
WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUOTING KEATS BUT POSSIBLY WASN'T HE SAID FIRMLY
THE VISITORS BOOK SAID BLAKE
E FOR--QUICK BEFORE HIS TYMPANUM RUNS DOWN ER--ER DESPERATELY SHE TRIED TO THINK
IT SAYS THAT AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS I SNATCHED UP THE PAPER AGAIN
THE PROVERBS WHICH MRS HERBERT SUGGESTED WERE FULL OF MOSS
BUT DON'T ENGAGE IT IN CONVERSATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAYS JENNY AND SHE AND RICHARD HENRY GO OFF TOGETHER
A LONG WINDING PATH LED UP THROUGH ITS GARDEN OF OLIVES TO THE FRONT DOOR AND THROUGH THE MIMOSA TREES WHICH FLANKED THIS DOOR WE COULD SEE ALREADY A FLUTTER OF WHITE APRONS
HALF-HOURS WITH OUR WATER-BEETLES THE FRETWORKER'S COMPANION AND STRENUOUS DAYS IN SIMLA HE OWED EVERYTHING TO THEM
BY TEA-TIME I HAD GOT AS FAR AS THIS ADVENTURES WITH A CAMERA IN SOMALILAND LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE THE BLANKTOWN LITERARY AND PHILO AND THEN I HAD AN IDEA
AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON IT WHY--'BATH-MAT OF COURSE OF COURSE I SAID
CELIA THEN BECAME VERY ALLURING AND SUGGESTED THAT I MIGHT FIND SOMEBODY WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE LENT A DELIGHTFUL PIANOLA BY SOMEBODY WHOSE DELIGHTFUL WIFE HAD HER EYE ON A DELIGHTFUL BOOKCASE
THE TURNSTILE CLICKS AND WITH THE HAPPY CROWDS WE MIX TO GAZE UPON--WELL I WAS SIX SAY GETTING ON FOR SEVEN
NOW IN ALGIERS THE BIRD SAID CHIFF-CHAFF AGAIN WITH AN ALMOST INDECENT PLAINNESS OF SPEECH
ANOTHER CROUPIER WITH HIS RAKE PULLED IT OFF AGAIN
BUT THESE ARE TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR WHEN WEIGHED AGAINST THIS OTHER--BREAKFAST MARMALADE
THEN IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY ARE ALL CLEAN--I SHOULD SAY CURED'--WE WILL PRESENT THEIR PRINCE TO THEM SO IT HAPPENED EVEN AS HI-YOU HAD SAID AND IN THE EVENING THE PRINCE A MODEL NOW OF MANLY BEAUTY WAS PRESENTED TO THEM AND THEY ACCLAIMED HIM WITH CHEERS
THREE MINUTES AGO I HAD TAKEN IT SUDDENLY BY SURPRISE AND WITH AN HERCULEAN EFFORT MOVED IT AN EIGHTEENTH OF A MILLIMETRE WESTWARDS
PERHAPS THEY'LL HAVE SOME OLD ONES OF VESUVIUS YOU CAN WORK IN
LOOK HERE SAID HERBERT YOU USED TO BE MATHEMATICAL
THE FEW SIMPLE TRICKS WHICH I AM ABOUT TO EXPLAIN IF STUDIED DILIGENTLY FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS WILL MAKE A GENUINE ADDITION TO THE GAIETY OF ANY GATHERING AND THE AMATEUR PRESTIDIGITATOR IF I MAY USE THAT WORD AGAIN WILL FIND THAT HE IS AMPLY REPAYING THE HOSPITALITY OF HIS HOST AND HOSTESS BY HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE GENERAL FESTIVITY
I WROTE ENTHUSIASTICALLY BACK AND ASKED HIM TO LUNCH
OBVIOUSLY A GENTLEMAN FROM THE COLOUR OF HIS PYJAMAS HIS IDENTITY DISC PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE PRIVATE SMITHLORD OF THE QTH BLANKSHIRES
IT MUST BE TAKEN THERE DELIBERATELY BY SOMEBODY WHO HAD A MORNING TO SPARE AND WAS WILLING TO DEVOTE IT TO THIS SPECIAL PURPOSE
THE GAMESTERS IT'S ABOUT TIME SAID SIMPSON ONE EVENING THAT WE WENT TO THE TABLES AND--ER HE ADJUSTED HIS SPECTACLES)--"HAD A LITTLE FLUTTER WE ALL LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT ADMIRATION
AT ONE TIME HE WAS UNDERNEATH BINGO
AS FAR AS I COULD FOLLOW IT WAS THIS
WHAT THEN IS TO BE DONE
THE BATTLE WENT ON MUCH AS BEFORE EXCEPT THAT THE TURKS WERE NATURALLY MORE OUTSPOKEN THAN THE BULGARS CALLING FREELY UPON ALLAH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT AND RECONCILING THEMSELVES TO THE END OF IT WITH KISMET I ALSO TURNED SOME OF THE HORSES INTO CAMELS AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE INDIAN TROOPS SEVERAL PAIRS OF PUTTEES INTO CHUPATIES
POOR BLIGHT!--OR PERHAPS SINCE THE TITLE WAS NEVER REALLY HIS WE SHOULD SAY POOR BLIGHTER IT IS DIFFICULT TO WITHHOLD OUR SYMPATHY FROM HIM
I USED TO FOLLOW HIM ABOUT AFFECTIONATELY IN THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD FALL INTO THE SEA
NOW THEN I'LL JUST SPELL IT TO YOU OVER AGAIN
IF I STARTED THE RIGHT WEIGHT THE REST OF THE FORTNIGHT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY WASTED
HE SEES HIS NAME CORRECTLY SPELT ON BUSES WHICH GO TO SUCH DIFFERENT SPOTS AS HAMMERSMITH AND WEST NORWOOD AND HIS NAME SPELT INCORRECTLY BENEATH THE PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE ILLUSTRATED BUTLER HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN-PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY
ONCE MORE YOU SHUFFLE THE PACK
BUT WE MUST DO SOMETHING NOW WE'RE HERE
AND WHICH IS R
SINCE THIS GREAT DISCOVERY OF MINE LIFE HAS BEEN A MORE PLEASURABLE BUSINESS
NO THAT'S WRONG--I NEVER DOUBLED THE HALF-CROWN
UNDER A HARD BLUE SKY OF INTENSE BRILLIANCE THE OLD CLAY HUT STOOD AMONG THE WATTLES
HE IS VERY HANDSOME FATHER SHE SAID LOOKING AT HI-YOU
THEN ANOTHER OUNCE
THERE IS NO FLOP
HOW SHE MUST LOVE YOU I SHOULD NEVER LEND SIMPSON A VILLA OF MINE I SAID
II IT WAS NEAR THE ALBERT MEMORIAL THAT THE GREAT INSPIRATION CAME TO HIM SOME WEEKS LATER
ONCE STOP THE SUPPLIES OF COAL YOU SEE AND YOU DRAIN THE LIFE-BLOOD OF THE COUNTRY OF COURSE SAID ANNE AND LOOKED VERY SERIOUS
IT MAY BE THAT JAMES THE HEAD BOXER HAS OVERDONE THE PINK GERANIUMS THIS YEAR BUT THERE IT IS
BUT WHEN THIS AGE-LONG STRUGGLE ENDS AND I HAVE SEEN THE ALLIES DISH UP THE GOOSE OF HINDENBURG--OH FRIENDS
MY DEAR I SAID I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DELIVER A LECTURE WHATEVER ON ASKED CELIA
LET'S TRY IT IT WAS SO HOT THAT I THINK IF THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE RUSTIC BENCH SECTION HAD TRIED TO MOVE US ON WE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SEAT AT ONCE
OF COURSE SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS IN LONDON BUT SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO GREAT RUSH OF PRINCES TO OUR LITTLE FLAT
DON'T INTERRUPT DEAR SAID DAHLIA
NOT ONLY ARE THE PAPERS HERE BUT A FULL CONFESSION BY JASPER
SHE NODDED BACK AT ME
HALLO ARCHIE
BUT DON'T BE LONG BECAUSE THERE'S A GOOD VIEW COMING THE GOOD VIEW CAME AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEY MERGED TOGETHER AND BECAME ONE LONG MOVING PANORAMA OF BEAUTY
BIRTHDAYS ARE MORE THAN DRESSING THE SERGEANT WAS A KINDLY SOUL HE LOVED HIS MEN UPON THE WHOLE HE'D ALSO HAD A FATHER'S ROLE PRESSED ON HIM FAIRLY LATELY
LIKE POLAR BEARS I SAID HOPEFULLY
FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T BE TOO FUNNY IT WAS AN ALARMING RESPONSIBILITY
SO TOBY AND I GO OFF TOGETHER
NOW THE SWINEHERD WHO WITH INSTINCTIVE GOOD BREEDING HAD TAKEN THE STRAW FROM HIS MOUTH ON ENTERING THE PALACE WAS A WELL-SET-UP YOUNG FELLOW SUCH AS MIGHT PLEASE EVEN A PRINCESS
AUNT ALICE PAYS
GREENGROCERY--THE CABBAGES AND FRUIT AND THINGS I TAKE MESELF AND SHE HAS DAFTS AND CROCUSES A-SMILING ON A SHELF
IN THAT CASE I NEEDN'T GO ON WITH THIS ARTICLE
I BEG YOU TO FORGET ABOUT IT
I CALLED THE RESULT HAPPY DAYS"--AN ATTRACTIVE TITLE YOU WILL AGREE--AND IN 1915 A NEW YORK PUBLISHER WAS FOUND FOR IT
THE CHIFF-CHAFF HE SAID TO OUR HOSTESS WITH AN INSUFFERABLE AIR OF KNOWLEDGE
I ONCE MADE SEVENTEEN I SAID
I HAVE ORDERED A WINDOW-BOX I DROPPED THE MARMALADE AND JUMPED UP EAGERLY
IT MUST BE SOMETHING QUITE PRIVATE AND SPECIAL BUT THE SHOP HAS GOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN I TELL THEM
AND OF COURSE IN ANY CASE YOU CAN ALWAYS DISSECT ONE AND SEE WHAT HE'S HAD FOR BREAKFAST
TO BE OR NOT TO BE--AH FIDO FIDO
I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE OVER-DRESSED I SAID AS WE PAID OUR SHILLINGS
AT LAST MY CHANCE HAD COME
MENTONE ON THE LEFT MONTE CARLO ON THE RIGHT SHE SAID AND RETURNED TO HER BOOK AGAIN
ADAM AND NIOBE WERE THERE DISRAELI MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR SAMSON BEFORE HE'D CUT HIS HAIR LORD BYRON AND APOLLO
YOU CAN'T DESERT THE NAVY AT THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS MIGHT SAID THOMAS PUFFING AT HIS PIPE
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO START YOUR COAL-PARTIES
AFTER SEVERAL MORE VERSES LIKE THIS HE BOWS AND RETIRES
CELIA THEN REPEATED OUR NAME AGAIN
OF COURSE HE IS A SPECIALIST TOO
I--ER--LOVE YOU ME SAID THE SHOPMAN SURPRISED
IT WAS CELIA'S IDEA TO CALL HIM BINGO
IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE WHICH FOLLOWS A VOICE IS HEARD SAYING DOES SHE AND LADY POLDOODLE ASKS KINDLY IS THAT ALL DEAR WHAT MORE COULD THERE BE SAYS MISS HERRICK WITH A SIGH
THE WORST OF LITERARY COMPOSITION IS THIS
THE NAMES AS I WAS SAYING OF SHE INTERRUPTED HIM WITH AN IMPATIENT GESTURE
THE LETTER SIMPLY SAID DEAR MR BROWN I'M ASKED BY MRS PHIPP TO SEND YOU THIS
I MUST BE EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A COMMOTION OUTSIDE AND A BREATHLESS FIGURE PUSHED ITS WAY INTO THE ROOM
IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU SAMUEL SAID DAHLIA BUT I DON'T THINK ARCHIE NODDED TO SIMPSON
WE SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN BEFORE BUT WE HAVE ONLY JUST FINISHED READING IT
SO FAR SO GOOD
THE SQUIRE LIKED COMPANY AND THE FRIENDS WHOM HE HAD ASKED DOWN FOR THE FESTIVE SEASON HAD ALL STAYED AT HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL BEFORE AND WERE THEREFORE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER
BLAKE RESIGNS HIS MESS PRESIDENCY OWING TO THE ENORMOUS PRICE OF SARDINES PER THOUSAND AND THE AMOUNT OF LIME JUICE CONSUMED BY CASUAL VISITORS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--I'LL RUN THE MESS ON FOUR FRANCS IF YOU'LL BAR GUESTS ROT IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH GUESTS
YOU BEGIN BY BORROWING A GOLD WATCH FROM ONE OF YOUR AUDIENCE
OF DESPAIR AS HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS BELT AND COUNTED OUT HIS RAPIDLY-DECREASING STOCK OF MONEY OR REFLECTED THAT HE WAS AS FAR FROM COMPLETING HIS NOVEL AS EVER
YET SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT IN THE BOOK OF FATE THE NAMES OF PERCY AND BRIDLINGTON"--HE CONSULTED HIS DIARY AGAIN--"YES BRIDLINGTON
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF TALK ABOUT IT IN HIS SUBURB PARTICULARLY FROM JENNY WHO HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE AND NATURALLY ONE EXPECTED SOMETHING RATHER--WELL RATHER MORE LIKE WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SAYING IT WAS LIKE
I SHAN'T BE LONG I WENT UPSTAIRS
WE THINK SAID MYRA IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY HEAVENLY IN THE LITTLE HOUSE
AND I DON'T WONDER I SETTLED DOWN WITH THE SANDWICHES TO LISTEN
ANY LETTERS YOU WANT POSTED I SAID IN AN OFF-HAND WAY
NO THANK YOU SHE SAID
WE'RE ALL HERE--THANKING YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US I SAID
LOOKING OUT OF MY WINDOW I SEE A LAMP-POST NOT IN FLOWER BENEATH A LOW GREY SKY
MAY I THEREFORE BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN FUTURE NOT TO SPLASH OR SPILL WATER ON YOUR FLOOR SEEING THAT IT CAUSES INCONVENIENCE TO THE TENANTS BENEATH YOU
THE FACT IS YOU'VE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION
INTRODUCED ME AGAIN
THE TWO VISITS 1888 1919 DISPERSAL AREAS 10A 10B 10C--CRYSTAL PALACE IT WAS I THINK IN 88 THAT LUCK OR PROVIDENCE OR FATE ASSUMED THE MORE MATERIAL STATE OF AUNT OR GREAT-AUNT ALICE AND TOOK THE WEATHER BEING FINE AND BILL THE ELDEST ONLY NINE THREE OF US BY THE BRIGHTON LINE TO SEE THE CRYSTAL PALACE
BUT IT IS NOT ONLY THE DOCTOR WHO COMPLAINS
HALLO HE SAID IN HIS SLOW VOICE
HE READ IT
BUT IT WAS A PLEASANT JOKE IN ITS DAY
JUST STOPES STOPES I SAID
AND AT INTERVALS WE SAID OH-H AND OH I SAY AND OH I SAY REALLY AND THERE WAS ONE PARTICULAR SPOT I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHERE SO THAT IT MIGHT BE MARKED BY A SUITABLE TABLET--AT THE SIGHT OF WHICH SIMPSON WAS OVERHEARD TO SAY MON DIEU FOR PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE
WHEN IS IT TO BE WHEN IS WHAT TO BE THE WEDDING HE SMILED
SAY THREE THOUSAND FEET UP THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SAID GASPARD FOR THE SAKE OF DISAGREEING
THE INSOLENCE OF OFFICE AND THE SPURNS"--TO TAKE ONLY ONE LINE--WOULD TAX THE MOST ELASTIC FACE
MISS D
BUT I KNOW NOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROSPECTS OF THE SEASON--OR AT ANY RATE OF THE FIRST WEEK OF IT--ARE
ABOUT FIVE NOTES SOUNDED
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THERE MUST BE ADDED TO BOBBY'S PROSPECTS THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HIS HEAD DEFINITELY SMACKED
I TOLD THE DRIVER WHERE TO GO AND ANDREW STEPPED IN WAVED GOOD-BYE TO ME FROM THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SUDDENLY UPON SOMETHING HARD
BESIDES THE MEN WILL BE HERE WITH THE LUGGAGE DIRECTLY
IN THE RIGOURS OF THE CAMPAIGN HE ALSO LOST HIS VOICE
HOW CAN IT MATTER WHAT FATE BEFALLS ME WITH TEN GOOD FELLOWS AND ONE GOOD DAY
THE FATE OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY DEPENDED UPON THE RESULT OF THIS HOLE
A LARGE SQUARE HALL OAK-BEAMED WHERE YOUR GUESTS CAN HANG ABOUT AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE DECIDING WHETHER TO PLAY GOLF OR SIT IN THE GARDEN
LIFE WHEN I TAKE MY BATH IN THE MORNING WHEN I STRIP FOR THE COOL DELIGHT AND THE HOUSEMAID BRINGS ME TOWELS AND THINGS DO I RECK OF THE COMING NIGHT
BUT SHE HESITATED
SO WITH MUTUAL EXPRESSIONS OF GOODWILL AND HOPES THAT ONE DAY WE MIGHT WRITE A TRAGEDY TOGETHER WE PARTED
ANXIOUS ABOUT PERCY SO AM I MY LOVE HE RESPONDED GRAVELY
HE HAD SEEN ALL THE MAPS
IT MUST BE SOMETHING REAL THIS TIME SINCE THE DAY WHEN SIMPSON WOKE ME UP AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO SHOW ME HIS STANCE-FOR-A-FULL-WOODEN-CLUB SHOT I HAVE DISTRUSTED HIS ENTHUSIASMS
IF ANYBODY WANTS A REALLY GOOD STORY ABOUT THE PENINSULAR WAR AND WILL DROP ME A LINE I SHALL BE GLAD TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM
ANNE FIRST NOTED SYMPTOMS OF IT AT A LUNCHEON-PARTY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH
LORD POLDOODLE WHAT IS A TADPOLE EXACTLY A TADPOLE HE ANSWERS DECISIVELY IS AN EXTREMELY IMMATURE WRIGGLING CREATURE WHICH IS QUITE RIGHTLY DUMB NOW STEPS FORWARD MR HORATIO BULLFINCH FULL OF SIMPLE ENTHUSIASM ONE OF THE LONDON SCHOOL
THE SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT'S MIND WAS NOT UNTROUBLED
YOU NEVER TOLD ME IF YOU LIKED IT I SIMPLY LOVED IT
I AM ANXIOUS BLIGHT SHE ANSWERED
AT THESE TIMES IT WAS PLEASANT TO KICK HUMPHREY OFF HIS STOOL ON TO THE DIVAN TO STAND ON THE DIVAN AND KICK HIM ON TO THE SOFA TO STAND ON THE SOFA AND KICK HIM ON TO THE BOOKCASE
THEY'D RUN YOU IN AT ONCE
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE FREDERICK OF MILVANIA SAID HI-YOU PROUDLY
BLANK BLANK MR ARCHIBALD MANNERING BLANK BLANK I'D BETTER GO AND BRUSH MY HAIR SIMPSON RETURNED TO US NERVOUS AND FULLY CHARGED WITH ADVICE
HE WILL HURT HIMSELF
I WAS ALL FOR WAITING TILL THE NEXT MORNING BUT CELIA EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A LETTERBOX ON OUR OWN FLOOR TWENTY YARDS DOWN THE PASSAGE
IF YEARS AGO I HAD EVER CONCEIVED A GLORIOUS FUTURE IN WHICH MY AUTOGRAPH MIGHT BE OF VALUE TO THE MORE PROMISCUOUS COLLECTORS THAT CONCEPTION HAS NOW BEEN SHATTERED
TO BE LYING HERE AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD WITH THE LAZY SEA CRAWLING BENEATH US SO MANY FEET BELOW LOOK SAID THE COUNTESS SUDDENLY
HE WOULDN'T OH IT'S QUITE EASY
RING UP WHO SAID THE PORTER
IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR GASPARD
TURKEY SURRENDERS AT DISCRETION DISCRETION I SAID INDIGNANTLY
IT IS ALL THERE HE SAID REVERENTLY AS HE GAVE IT TO ME
YOU SHOW THE EMPTY CASE OF THIS WATCH TO THE COMPANY BEFORE WRAPPING THE WATCH IN THE HANDKERCHIEF AND HANDING IT BACK TO ITS OWNER
LEAVING ASIDE FOR THE MOMENT THE QUESTION OF SUPER-TAX THE PRIZES WHICH FALL TO HIS LOT ARE WORTH SOMETHING OF AN EFFORT
HE GOES BACK TO CANADA TO-MORROW AND WILL SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS THERE THAT THE OLD COUNTRY CAN STILL HOLD ITS OWN IN RESOURCE DETERMINATION AND STAYING POWER
THE REGIMENT IS WHERE IT WAS I'M IN THE SAME OLD NINTH PLATOON
I SIMPLY PREFER BATHING IN THE MORNING OO YOU SAID THIS MORNING YOU PREFERRED BATHING IN THE AFTERNOON SAYS JENNY LIKE A FLASH
THE SMALL BLACK ONE OF COURSE SAID THE KING CROSSLY
SO THE IMPERIAL ARMY WAS MOBILIZED AND AMIDST A WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF PATRIOTIC ENTHUSIASM BY THOSE WHO WERE REMAINING BEHIND THE BOROVIAN TROOPS MARCHED TO THE FRONT
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA I SAID
IT WAS MY DUTY I FELT NOT TO DISCOURAGE JOHNNY
TRUE IT WANTS A LITTLE EXPLAINING TO SHOPKEEPERS
HE GIVES US HIS FAMOUS POEM BERKELEY SQUARE THE MEN WHO COME FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY ARE TALL AND VERY FAIR THE MEN WHO COME FROM THE SOUTH COUNTRY HAVE HARDLY ANY HAIR BUT THE ONLY MEN IN THE WORLD FOR ME ARE THE MEN OF BERKELEY SQUARE
AND YOU HAD BETTER COME ALONG TOO MY MAN FOR IT MAY WELL BE THAT WITHOUT YOUR AID SOME OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S CONVERSATION WOULD ESCAPE US
WHAT WAS THE CAPTAIN'S NAME PERHAPS I HAVE NOT GOT IT QUITE RIGHT FOR I HAVE HAD AN EVENTFUL WEEK SINCE THEN
I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A BOTANICAL PAPER ASKING FOR AN ARTICLE ON THE FLORA OF TRENCH LIFE
WE HAD TO HAVE A FAREWELL PIECE
REALLY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT YOU KNOW
MAY I SUGGEST SIR SAID THE MAJOR THAT THE POCKETS OF ALL SHOULD BE SEARCHED
THAT EVENING WHEN THE DAY WAS DEAD THEY TUCKED A BABE OF SIX IN BED ARRANGED THE PILLOWS FOR HIS HEAD AND SAW THE LIGHTS WERE SHADED
WE COULD STOP THOMAS I SAID
S FOR SISTER
S FOR SISTER
I SEE CELIA THERE IN HER PINK SUN-BONNET GATHERING THE FLOWERS LOVINGLY BRINGING AN ARMFUL OF THEM INTO THE HALL DISTURBING ME SOMETIMES IN THE LIBRARY WITH AREN'T THEY BEAUTIES
NOW THEN I CALLED TO THE PORTER
AND AS THE WAR GREW OLDER THE NOISE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S GUN LEFT ME CONSIDERABLY COLDER
SO THE NEXT TIME I MET HIM HE SHOOK ME WARMLY BY THE HAND AND TOLD ME HOW GLAD HE WAS THAT I WAS AN ADMIRER OF ANTOINE VAURELLE'S NOVELS
THE WEIGHING-MACHINE GAVE OUT THEN OH BUT DARLING THAT'S MUCH TOO MUCH STILL IT'S WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR I POINTED OUT
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GO AND BUY THREEPENNYWORTH
AND IF SO I WENT ON WILL HE LEND US THE MONEY TO PAY THE RENT WITH ER--YES SAID CELIA
CELIA CAUGHT MY EYE AND WENT ON HURRIEDLY WELL THEN SOMEBODY GOES OUTSIDE AND THEN HE ASKS QUESTIONS FROM OUTSIDE ASKED MRS HERBERT
WITH A GASPING CRY RICARDO HARRINGTONI FAINTED
A FORTNIGHT AFTER BINGO CAME TO US WE FOUND IN A PEKINESE BOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF GOODWOOD LO
WELL WE'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT SAID ARCHIE TO THE OTHER TABLE
DID HE MARRY HER AFTER ALL LORD POLDOODLE LOOKING SLIGHTLY MORE CHEERFUL GETS ONCE MORE ON TO HIS LEGS
NOW DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO WRITE TO YOUR MOTHER OH I MUST SHE WROTE
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I SAID WE THINK IT'S UP TO SIMPSON AND THOMAS TO BE ENGLISH GENTLEMEN
WHATEVER LORD A
WHAT WILL BE WILL BE YOU SAY TO YOURSELF OR IN ITALIAN TO YOUR FRIENDS AND TO SUPPOSE THAT A CHARM ROUND THE NECK OF A SOLDIER WILL DIVERT A GERMAN SHELL IS RIDICULOUS BUT OUT THERE THROUGH THE CRUMPS THINGS LOOK OTHERWISE
ACTOR-MANAGERS NOD TO HIM
IT IS A LITTLE LONG--ABOUT TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND WORDS I RECKON IT--BUT I HAVE A SUGGESTION TO MAKE WHICH WILL MEET THAT DIFFICULTY
IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE IT
HE CLINGS TO ME
HE BECKONED TO THE WAITER
HE BECKONED TO THE WAITER
YET ALL SO CUNNINGLY DISPOSED THAT FROM OUTSIDE IT LOOKS ONLY A COTTAGE OR AT MOST TWO COTTAGES PERSUADED INTO ONE
BY JOVE PROFESSOR THAT'S GOOD HE SAID AS HE SLAPPED HIS KNEE
YOUR WIFE IS IN SPAIN MANAGER
AFTER ALL WE MUST NOT FORGET THE POODLE
THIS IS NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT I MAKE THE MOST MARVELLOUS PROGRESS IN THE ART OF FLYING
ISN'T IT LOVELY IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SHE IS PROUD OF IT
A DELIGHTFUL THING HAPPENED
THERE WOULD BE GUTTURAL EXCLAMATIONS FROM GERMANS
AT LUNCH I DECIDED TO HAVE A LITTLE FINANCIAL TALK WITH CELIA
BUT HOW COULD SLUGS GET UP HERE ASKED CELIA IN SURPRISE
WHAT I FEEL IS THIS I SAID
I THINK OLD CHAP HE SAYS TO THOMAS I'LL WEAR THE COATS AFTER ALL AND THE BAGS SAYS THOMAS AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE A SUIT SIMPSON PUTS ON THE TWO COATS AND APPEARS VERY BIG AND HOT
PERHAPS YOU HAD GUESSED
THAT'S IT SO FOR A MONTH WE HAVE LIVED IN OUR CASTLE OF STOPES
THEY GROW IN BULGARIA ARE YOU SURE I'M SURE THAT THESE ONES DID
NO BE"--B-E
I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
HE HAD GONE TO THE BIG HOUSE WITH A MESSAGE FOR MR TREVENA HER LADYSHIP'S BUTLER
BUT STILL I RATHER HOPE SPECTATORS WILL OBSERVING ANY LACK OR SKILL REMARK THIS IS HIS FIRST APPEARANCE YES I HOPE THEY WILL
THE BROWN ONE PLEASED A VISCOUNT'S SON NOT RICHARD BUT THE OTHER ONE HE GAVE HER A DELIGHTFUL FLAT THE BLONDE ONE LOVED A MAN CALLED ALFRED SPRATT
SAME OLD WHISTLE AND SAME OLD BANG
BUT THE KING GAZED UPON THE PRINCE AS ONE FASCINATED
HE IS AN UNDERSIZED LION
NOW THIS ANSWER EVEN IF IT COMES QUITE FRESH TO THE STALLS WILL LOSE MUCH OF ITS EFFECT IF IT IS SAID WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A CIGARETTE
BUT THESE MAY HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL ONES THROWN IN
WE CAN SHARE HOUSEKEEPING EXPENSES AND IT WILL BE AS CHEAP AS ANYTHING BUT TO GO INTO A STRANGER'S HOUSE SAID DAHLIA ANXIOUSLY
HOWEVER NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT ART NOWADAYS
FROM SIR DOUGLAS HAIG THE R.S.V.P
YET HE CARED FOR NONE OF THESE THINGS
HOLE AFTER HOLE WE HALVED IN A MECHANICAL EIGHT
SURBITON SURBITON IS PASSED ROUND THE BACK SEATS
DROWN SERPENT HE SAID MAGNIFICENTLY
DROWN SERPENT HE SAID MAGNIFICENTLY
CELIA IT IS NOBLE OF YOU TO SACRIFICE DON'T GO SHE CRIED IN ANGUISH
HORRAY SAID CELIA
NOW SHE NEED NEVER KNOW
BUT YOU'RE BUSY
THE LAST PERSON LECTURED ON THE MINOR SATELLITES OF JUPITER AND THE ONE WHO COMES AFTER ME IS DOING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BYZANTINE PERIOD SO I CAN TAKE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN LIKE FROSTBITES SAID CELIA HELPFULLY
WE MUST HAVE A LAST GAME HE SAID AND THIS ONE MUST BE DECISIVE FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE EMPIRE I AGREED
HE WENT INTO THAT LAST SHOW AS SENIOR SUBALTERN OF D BILLY WAS KNOCKED OUT PRETTY EARLY AND BLAKE TOOK ON
AND I WEIGHED THE CIGAR-CASE IN MY HAND
THIS IS ALL WRONG
THE SIGNALLING OFFICER'S OFFICIAL MOUNT IS A BICYCLE BUT A BICYCLE IN THIS WEATHER
THE SCENE IS LAID IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF BADAJOZ AND THE CHIEF INTEREST CENTRES ROUND AN OLD--YES YOU HAVE GUESSED IT--AN OLD CLAY HUT IN THE WATTLES
MCANDREW YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW I FELT ABOUT THIS
WHAT OF THAT IF THE OWLS ARE FAIRLY PERKY
IT'S THE GAME THAT CALLS ME SIMPLY TO BE ON THE FIELD OF PLAY
MCANDREW I WAS SO STAGGERED THAT I COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE ADEQUATE RETORT
I BROUGHT TO MY INTERPRETATION OF DIFFERENT OPS AN ELAN A VERVE A JE NE SAIS QUOI_--AND SEVERAL OTHER FRENCH WORDS--WHICH WERE THE ASTONISHMENT OF ALL WHO LISTENED TO ME
BY THAT TIME I REALIZED THAT I HATED HIM
QUITE RIGHT NOT TO KEEP IT WAITING
BY THAT TIME YOU WILL HAVE DISCOVERED WHETHER YOU ARE IN A MOOD TO STOP AND LISTEN TO THEIR CHATTER OR PREFER TO PASS THEM BY WITH A NOD
ONE COULDN'T BE A POODLE AFTER THAT
OH I WANT A VOTE OR SOMETHING
I HAD LOST INTEREST IN THE PERFORMANCE FOR THE CUP WAS MINE BUT I DID ADMIRE HIS COLONIAL GRIT
AND IF YOU ARE A SPORTSMAN I ADDED YOU WILL BRING ME OUT SOME TEA IN HALF AN HOUR AT SIX-THIRTY I WAS STILL LOOKING--AND SWINGING
FRIGHTFULLY I SAID AND LEFT MY MOUTH WELL OPEN
BUT THERE'LL BE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THERE ALL WITH GARDENS OF THEIR OWN ALL POINTING TO THINGS AND SAYING WE'VE GOT ONE OF THOSE IN THE EAST BED OR WOULDN'T THAT LOOK NICE IN THE SOUTH ORCHID HOUSE AND YOU AND I WILL BE QUITE QUITE OUT OF IT I SIGHED AND HELPED MYSELF FROM THE WEST TOAST-RACK
OR ANYHOW YOU'VE BEEN SKIPPING THERE'S NOTHING SAID CELIA IN THE SAME MOURNFUL VOICE
ARMAGEDDON THE CONVERSATION HAD TURNED AS IT ALWAYS DOES IN THE SMOKING-ROOMS OF GOLF CLUBS TO THE STATE OF POOR OLD ENGLAND AND PORKINS HAD SUMMED THE MATTER UP
SUPPOSE SHE SAID TIMIDLY YOU WROTE ABOUT STOPES AND MR BARLOW HAPPENED TO SEE IT AND KNEW HOW MUCH WE WANTED IT AND WELL THEN SAID CELIA FIRMLY IF HE WERE A GENTLEMAN HE WOULD GIVE IT TO US VERY WELL
ANOTHER SILENCE
I LOVE YOU JOHN SPEAKING I THINK I MUST HAVE ALWAYS LOVED YOU MARY GOING IT HE TOOK HER HAND IN HIS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID OUR HOST FAINTLY WHEN I HAD FINISHED
THEN THE HAPPY COUPLE DROVE AWAY
LOCAL COLOUR I EXPLAINED
NO THANK YOU SAYS MR DENNIS EADIE--DASH IT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DO AT HOME OURSELVES
ALWAYS HE WAS PRESENT WHEN THE OPERATIONS WERE DISCUSSED
ABOUT HE SAID COLDLY
NOW WHAT SHALL WE LOOK AT FIRST THE FLOWERS FIRST
FOR IT IS NOT MEET THAT I SHOULD REMAIN HERE AS A PERPETUAL REMINDER TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS OF WHAT HE WOULD FAIN FORGET WELL THAT'S VERY HANDSOME OF YOU VERY HANDSOME INDEED
JENNY IS SHOWING IT TO HIM
BUT THE THOUGHT OF THIS LOVELY CRAB WHICH JENNY THINKS SO MUCH OF FORBIDS PROTEST
IT CAME TO US WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK THAT WE WERE A VERY LARGE PARTY
INTRODUCED MYRA AS MY WIFE ARCHIE AS HER BROTHER AND DAHLIA AS ARCHIE'S WIFE
BEHIND US A DOZEN VILLAGE CHILDREN NOW TRAILED EAGERLY
SOMETIMES THEY WOULD BOTH FALL OUT OF A BALLOON TOGETHER
THE TIME HAS PASSED ABSURDLY QUICKLY SAID MYRA
HASTILY BORROWING THE COLONEL'S HORSE HE URGED THE GALLANT ANIMAL UP THE TRENCH AND AWAY OVER THE TOP
AND BEHOLD
ALREADY A CROWD WAS COLLECTING
I HAD ONLY TO GO INTO THE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS AND MURMUR RAT'S TAIL TO MYSELF OR MORE OFFENSIVE STILL CHEWED STRING FOR HIM TO RUSH AT ME
ON THE FEMALE SIDE THE SAME ANIMAL IS BINGO'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER
ON THE FIFTH GREEN HE WAS ABOUT TO BRUSH AWAY A LEAF
WELL I HESITATED I--ER--WELL LADIES OFTEN LIKE THE DATE PUT IN
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ICE AND THE THOMPSONS ARE COMING TO DINNER
DUKE LIGHTING CIGARETTE I TRUST PERKINS THAT IS ENOUGH
SHYLY HE BROUGHT OUT HIS LAST ACID-DROP AND SHARED IT WITH HER
AS THE CHATTER DIES DOWN A CHORD IS STRUCK ON THE PIANO
AT EIGHTEEN-STONE-TWO I JUMPED OFF FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO SHUT THE WINDOW WHICH SOME CARELESS HOUSEMAID HAD OPENED AGAIN
HOW'S THIS?--'MY LORD MAYOR LORDS BARONETS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND SUNDRIES THAT'S GOT IN EVERYBODY THAT'S ALL RIGHT
ONE WORD MORE
MY DEAR SIR I SHOULD REPLY OR MADAM YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT SHOP
BUT IT HAS ITS TIMES
LET ME HAVE A FEW HOURS ALONE WITH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IN THE FORM IN WHICH I HAVE KNOWN HIM SO LONG AND THEN WHEN HE IS HIMSELF AGAIN LET ME GO
ALL YOUR ENGLISH MASTERS THEY ALL COME FROM HIM
PERHAPS THE FACT THAT THIS COLLECTION IS FINAL WILL EXCUSE ITS AIR OF SCRAPPINESS
HOW D'YOU DO
I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHAT PICTURE OF THE EVENT MYRA AND I HAD CONJURED UP IN OUR MINDS BUT I FANCY IT WAS ONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I HAD MEANT TO DO A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF WORK THAT DAY BUT I COULDN'T GET MY MIND OFF HERBERT'S WRETCHED PROBLEM
PETER'S PREVIOUS LETTER DICTATED TO HIS NURSE-SECRETARY HAD ACCORDING TO ARCHIE BEEN FULL OF GOOD THINGS
IT IS EASY TO MAKE THESE MISTAKES
THE BERSAGLIERI ADVANCED IMPETUOUSLY WITH CRIES OF EN AVANT_!"--NO THAT'S WRONG--WITH CRIES OF--WELL ANYHOW THEY ADVANCED
I AM AFRAID MY DEAR HE SAID THAT YOU WILL THINK ME FOOLISH
AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL SAID THE GODS IN OLYMPUS TO EACH OTHER
HOME NOTES THE WAY DOWN SYDNEY SMITH OR NAPOLEON OR MARCUS AURELIUS SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT TIME SAID THAT AFTER TEN DAYS ANY LETTER WOULD ANSWER ITSELF
HER LIFE THOUGH SHORT WAS FULL OF INCIDENT AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS ABOUT HER WHICH I COULD HAVE TOLD THAT PORTER
BUT I WILL NOT HAVE HIM A POODLE
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN UP LONG AGO TAKING NOTES FOR THE ADMIRALTY I HAD A ROTTEN NIGHT SAID THOMAS
HE WAS SPLENDID
CURSE HIM
SHE IS HOLDING RICHARD HENRY BY THE HAND
A YEAR LATER HE MARRIED A DISTANT COUSIN AND SOON ROSE TO A CONDITION OF PROSPERITY
WE SHALL ONLY JUST BE IN TIME FOR IT V
GASPARD HAD NO HOPE BUT ONE CONSOLATION
I AIN'T COMPLAINING MIND BUT STILL WHEN LATER ON SOME NEWISH BLOKE STOPS ONE AND LAUGHS A BLIGHTY BILL I'LL WONDER WHERE'S THE JOKE SAME OLD TRENCHES SAME OLD VIEW SAME OLD RATS AS BLOOMING TAME SAME OLD DUG-OUTS NOTHING NEW SAME OLD SMELL THE VERY SAME SAME OLD BODIES OUT IN FRONT SAME OLD STRAFE FROM 2 TILL 4 SAME OLD SCRATCHING SAME OLD UNT

THE BLOOD OF EVERY TRUE ESSENLANDER SAID THE LEADER-WRITER OF THE DIEDELDORF PATRIOT AFTER SENDING OUT FOR ANOTHER POT OF BEER WILL BOIL WHEN IT HEARS OF THIS FRESH INSULT TO OUR BELOVED FLAG AN INSULT WHICH CAN ONLY BE WIPED OUT WITH BLOOD THEN SEEING THAT HE HAD TWO BLOODS IN ONE SENTENCE HE CROSSED THE SECOND ONE OUT SUBSTITUTED THE SWORD AND LIT A FRESH CIGARETTE
BUT A SUN-DIAL
WELL AS I SAY HE ASKED ME TO GO ON TO BOWL AND I TOOK FOUR WICKETS FOR THIRTEEN RUNS
YOU KNEW ME THIS IS JOHN
OF COURSE YOU ARE
SIMPLY ALL OVER THE PLACE
I LOOKED AT BOBBY IN SURPRISE AND THEN SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
DIDN'T I MAKE IT CLEAR ABOUT ROSE
IT MUST BE
AND WHEN A MAN LIKE THAT INVITES A WHOLE CROWD OF PEOPLE TO COME TO YOUR FLAT JUST ABOUT THE TIME WHEN YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE SARDINES ON TOAST--WELL IT ISN'T POLITE TO PUT THE CHAIN ON THE DOOR AND EXPLAIN THROUGH THE LETTER-BOX THAT YOU HAVE GONE AWAY FOR A WEEK
I SEE THAT KENT IS GOING TO THE PROSPECTS ARE ALL RIGHT SAID DICK IF ONLY I CAN GET INTO FORM SOON ENOUGH
THE SACK SAID THOMAS
I SAY NOTHING OF THE RESULT
FOR SOME MILES ALL WENT WELL
WHAT OTHER BREAKFAST CONVERSATION HAVE I
PLUMP WERE THE TWIN POACHED EGGS YET NOT OBESE UPON THEIR THRONES OF TOAST AND CRISP THE BACON I FACE THEIR LOSS UNDAUNTED UNAFRAID IF ONLY I MAY KEEP MY MARMALADE
AND STUCK TO IT
YOU'LL HAVE A DRINK SIR SAID BILLY
SUPPOSE EIGHTEEN TURNED UP
WHEN THE FLAMES HAVE DIED DOWN YOU EXHIBIT THE BASIN WHEREIN TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL IS TO BE SEEN AN EXCELLENT CHRISTMAS PUDDING WHICH YOU MAY ASK YOUR AUDIENCE TO SAMPLE
NOT THAT IT IS GOING TO MATTER IN THE LEAST
WE NEEDN'T LOSE SAID MYRA
UNLESS YOU CARRIED HIM UP THERE IN A SACK NO NO PROTESTED THE EARL VIGOROUSLY
AND THIS YOU ADD IS HER HUSBAND THEN--ER--THOMAS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR THOMAS I SAID
A POETRY RECITAL IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRIVILEGE OF ART TO BE PATRONIZED BY WEALTH AND RANK
FIRST ONE THEN THE OTHER SEEMED TO GAIN THE ADVANTAGE
AT LAST MY LOVE HE BREATHED
AH IT WAS THERE THE SECRETARY MET HIS WATERLOO BUT PERISHED GAMELY PLAYING TWENTY-TWO
I HAVE FOLLOWED THESE EARLY MASTERS OR WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
MEANWHILE WITH THE AID OF A LITTLE WAX YOU HAVE ATTACHED AN INVISIBLE HAIR TO THE HANDKERCHIEF THE OTHER END OF IT BEING FASTENED TO THE PALM OF YOUR LEFT HAND
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM DIDN'T YOU HEAR
HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING TILL TO-NIGHT I SAID QUICKLY
WITH A RUSH BINGO IS AT HIM
SHORT OF SIGHT BUT WARM OF HEART AND WITH ON A BAD PITCH A NASTY BREAK FROM THE OFF MR S
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME I SAID THAT YOU HAD STOOD FOR PARLIAMENT AND THAT YOUR SUPPORTERS HAD CONSOLED YOU WITH A LARGE PIECE OF PLATE
TRUSTING TO BE FAVOURED WITH YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN THE MATTER WE ARE MY LORD YOURS FAITHFULLY BILLINGS BILLINGS BILLINGS GERTIE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND IN HORROR
MY DAUGHTER HE GASPED MY LITTLE HYACINTH
FOR SIX MONTHS HE SAT THERE AND NO DOUBT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SEEN ALL THAT THERE WAS TO SEE OF THE WORLD WHEN THE SUMMONS CAME WHICH WAS TO GIVE HIM SO DIFFERENT AN OUTLOOK ON LIFE
CUTTING THE LEMON IN TWO YOU HAND HALF TO ONE MEMBER OF YOUR AUDIENCE AND HALF TO ANOTHER ASKING THEM TO HOLD THE HALVES UP IN FULL VIEW OF THE COMPANY
YOU ARE A SILLY ASS HE SAID
AT THE ORCHIDS WE WERE CONTEMPTUOUSLY SNIFFY
THIS TIME A BRILLIANT ONE
BUT I COULDN'T GET THE WORDS OUT AGAIN
WHAT ABOUT BARONETS SAID CELIA
I WITHDRAW MY SUGGESTION SAID ARCHIE
IT'S TOO GOOD TO WAIT SAID CELIA EXCITEDLY
EXACTLY YOUR MAJESTY SAID HI-YOU
WAS IT AGAINST A GIRLS SCHOOL SAID BOBBY
THEY SANG IT IN THIS PIECE ANYHOW I WOULD SAY STIFFLY AND TURN MY BACK ON HIM AND BEGIN
SO HE PUT IT IN HIS POCKET AGAIN MEANING TO LEAVE IT AT SCOTLAND YARD ON HIS WAY TO THE CITY
STEPHEN WITH MUCH THAT WAS I HOLD UNIQUE EVEN OUR PARODIES OF THE RUBAIYAT WERE DISAPPOINTING--YES IN CERTAIN WAYS
SEATED IN YOUR COMFORTABLE CLUB MY VERY DEAR SIR OR IN YOUR DELIGHTFUL DRAWING-ROOM MADAM YOU SMILE PITYINGLY
I MYSELF AM QUITE READY TO SET THE EXAMPLE AND AS HE SPOKE HE DREW OUT THREE RECEIPTED BILLS AND A PRICE LIST OF TOMATOES AND PLACED THEM BEFORE THE COLONEL
MISS HERRICK BEGINS AGAIN STARTING THIS TIME WITH THE TITLE
BUT THACKERAY--I MEAN THACKERAY IS_--ER I'VE FORGOTTEN THE AUTHOR'S NAME FOR THE MOMENT AND GO ON HASTILY I MEAN--ER--THACKERAY OBVIOUSLY HE SHAKES ME BY THE HAND
THE AUTHORITY WHO WAS FREE BY THIS TIME LOOKED AT ME INDIGNANTLY
THERE WAS A FIERCE FIGHT WHICH RAGED ROUND THE OLD CLAY HUT IN THE WATTLES
BESIDES WE'RE NOT COVETING STOPES
WHAT DO WE START WITH I ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF FENCHURCH STREET MANAGER
THEY HAD TWO STARS ON EACH SLEEVE
FATHER SHE CRIED IT'S NOT SMITHLORD IT'S LORD SMITH
OH OO GOES OME I SORT OF UMS
BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
BILLY WAS THE SENIOR COMPANY COMMANDER AND TOOK CHARGE OF THE BATTALION
WE SHOOK HANDS WITH ALL OF THEM
IT MEANS THAT AT SEVEN-THIRTY O'CLOCK ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER THE 8TH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY RESIDENTS OF BLANKTOWN WILL TURN OUT THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS IN THEIR DRAWING-ROOMS PERHAPS EVEN IN THEIR HALLS
I SIGHED HEAVILY
FAIR WAS THE PORRIDGE IN THE DAYS OF PEACE AND STILL MORE FAIR THE CREAM AND SUGAR TAKEN
IF THERE IS THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE OF BINGO--OF THIS ANIMAL GROWING UP INTO A POODLE I SAID HE LEAVES MY HOUSE AT ONCE MY POODLE SAID CELIA WAS A LOVELY DOG OF COURSE SHE WAS ONLY A CHILD THEN
AH SMITH MY BOY SAID THE COLONEL AS HE BUSTLED IN
I SUPPOSE SAID ARCHIE TO SIMPSON THEY DO EXPECT ALL OF US AND NOT ONLY YOU
IT IS DISTINCTLY AN ILLUSION WORTH TRYING AND IF YOU BEGIN IT IN THE MANNER I HAVE DESCRIBED QUITE POSSIBLY SOME WAY OF FINISHING IT UP WILL OCCUR TO YOU ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT
NO HE'D SHAVE THE WHOLE CABOODLE
MR WORPLE VERY SUDDENLY DAWN AT SURBITON WHERE SAYS A FRIGHTENED VOICE AT THE BACK
AND LOOKING BACK ON IT TO-DAY THE MEMORIES HAVE PASSED AWAY I FIND THAT I CAN ONLY SAY ROUGHLY TO GAZE ON HEAVEN
THE DAY'S FUN WAS OVER
THERE THEY STAYED
AND IF THE YOUNG DRAMATIST ANSWERS CALLOUSLY YES IT SIMPLY SHOWS THAT HE HAS NO FEELING FOR THE STAGE WHATEVER
THEN JUST WHEN WE SEEMED SETTLED FOR THE WINTER WE WERE ORDERED SOUTH AGAIN
OR DO YOU POSSIBLY THINK MASTER MIGHT HE LOOKED VERY WISTFUL THAT LAST MORNING SO WISTFUL THAT MISTRESS COULDN'T BEAR IT AND SHE SLIPPED HIM IN HASTILY BETWEEN THE REVOLVER AND THE BORACIC POWDER JUST TO LOOK AFTER YOU SHE SAID
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL PHRASE AND HE RATTLED IT OFF
YOU'RE FIXED UP HERE TILL TUESDAY ANY HOW MY DEAR DICK I'VE COME DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS REST
SUDDENLY HAS HE BEEN ILL-TREATING YOU AGAIN
SILLY ISN'T FELICIA THE ALLY OF ESSENLAND
THEN WITH A POUNCE HE WAS UPON HUMPHREY
IS IT STILL THERE WHY NOT
OUR PUPPY MAY GROW INTO A SMALL LION OR A MASTIFF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
READ IT QUICKLY
I HAD PUT ON AT LEAST ANOTHER OUNCE OF FLESH
S FOR SISTER--THIS IS ANOTHER SISTER OF COURSE
IN ANOTHER MINUTE COLONEL BLOWHARD HAD ENTERED
THE PROBLEM OF LIFE THE NOISE OF THE RETREATING SEA CAME PLEASANTLY TO US FROM A DISTANCE
THE ONLY BOOK OF VAURELLE'S WHICH I HAD READ WAS CONSOLATRICE IN AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION
LET US NOW PASS ON TO THE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF EXITS AND ENTRANCES TO THE YOUNG PLAYWRIGHT THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING HIS CHARACTERS ON TO THE STAGE WOULD SEEM MUCH LESS THAN THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING THEM SOMETHING TO SAY WHEN THEY ARE THERE
SOMETIMES IN THE SEARCH FOR AN IDEA HE HAD FREQUENTED THE RESTAURANTS WHERE THE GREAT SAMUEL JOHNSON HIMSELF HAD EATEN AND SOMETIMES HE HAD FREQUENTED OTHER RESTAURANTS WHERE EVEN THE GREAT SAMUEL JOHNSON HIMSELF HAD BEEN UNABLE TO EAT
AND SO SEEING THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUENTS I MUST LET YOU IMAGINE HOW THEY ALL MIXED
I SHALL END UP THIS INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE ARTICLE WITH A RATHER MORE DIFFICULT ILLUSION
I WILL ANSWER YOUR LETTERS HOW GLADLY
THEN HE WENT TO A RESTAURANT WHERE GOLDSMITH HAD NEVER BEEN AND ORDERED A JOINT AND TWO VEG
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SMITH FORGETFULLY
TO THINK THAT A MONTH AGO WE WERE QUITE HAPPY WITH A FEW PINK GERANIUMS
A WORD FROM HIS FATHER TO THE EFFECT THAT THE GENTLEMAN ABOVE WAS GETTING SICK OF IT AND JOHNNY'S WHOLE LIFE MIGHT BE ALTERED
YES HE WAS TO BE A WRITER
SUGAR
I CAN'T DO IT ALL MYSELF THE NEXT MORNING I WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT
TO REMAIN A SECOND LIEUTENANT OR THIS
THERE IS BUSTLE NOISE CONFUSION
HE HANDED ME THE BOOK--IN FRENCH
IN LONDON I WENT ON IT IS RAINING
IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE APPOINTMENT WILL BE KEPT FOR SHE HAS HURRIED RICHARD HENRY PAST ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL THINGS WHICH HE WANTED TO STOP WITH FOR A LITTLE
WELL GOOD-BYE AND SHE DRIFTED OUT
IF I CAN'T I SHALL GIVE IT YOU BACK AND WASH MY HANDS OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS--EXCEPT OF COURSE FOR THE MONTHLY LETTER OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY ALLOW YOU AT THE SCRUBBS
MOTHER WATCHES THEM ANXIOUSLY
WHERE'S YOUR BALL HE GROWLED
WITH PRACTICE EVEN THE CLUMSIEST OF US CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT DEXTERITY IN THE ART OF ILLUSION TO PUZZLE THE MOST OBSERVANT OF OUR FELLOW-GUESTS
WHAT A DISAPPOINTING NAME SHE SAID
I'M SORRY SIMPSON BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MOVING FROM THE TEMPLE TO CRICKLEWOOD OR WHEREVER IT IS AND THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS PAYING THE THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR IS JOLLY INTERESTING BUT IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO DRAG US UP FROM THE COUNTRY TO TELL US ABOUT IT
IN THE LANGUAGE OF--ER--CROWNS IT MEANS YOU ARE MY QUEEN I INSISTED ON A CROWN
YES M'LADY
I THINK I EXPECTED A MAN IN A BROWN SHIRT AND LEGGINGS WHO WOULD ASK ME TO PUT IT RIGHT THERE AND TELL ME I WAS SOME ENGLISHMAN HOWEVER HE TURNED OUT TO BE EXACTLY LIKE ANYBODY ELSE IN LONDON
A FEW DROPS SPRINKLED DISCRIMINATELY ON FREDERICK WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HIS EARLIER SHAPE AND THE WEDDING COULD THEN BE ANNOUNCED
AND I AM STILL A SECOND LIEUTENANT
I AM AFRAID THAT THE BORROWED HANDKERCHIEF TO WHICH YOU APPLIED THE MATCH REALLY DID GET BURNT AND YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO OFFER THE OWNER ONE OF YOUR OWN INSTEAD
THE NEXT MORNING THE PAPERS ANNOUNCED THAT THE CUCKOO HAD BEEN HEARD IN DEVONSHIRE--POSSIBLY A DIFFERENT ONE BUT IN NO WAY SUPERIOR TO OURS EXCEPT IN THE MATTER OF ITS PRESS AGENT WELL EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE SAID DID YOU HEAR THE CUCKOO TO EVERYBODY ELSE UNTIL I BEGAN TO GET RATHER TIRED OF IT
BESIDES THEY MUST HAVE TRIED EVERYBODY ELSE BEFORE THEY GOT DOWN TO ME
IT WAS UPON THIS TERRIBLE SCENE THAT RICHARD ARRIVED
NO SISTER IDIOT
I FEAR IT MAY BE MONTHS ANNE SIGHED DEEPLY
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY LIVED YES SAID ELLISON
ON THE LAST DAY OF HIS TRAINING GASPARD SPOKE SERIOUSLY TO HIS INSTRUCTOR
THAT'S ILLEGAL I SAID SHARPLY YOU MUST PICK IT UP
AND GIUSEPPE SHOULD HAVE WASHED HIS FACE SINCE LAST FRIDAY
AT TWELVE-STONE-SEVEN I SHOUTED THROUGH THE DOOR TO CELIA THAT I SHOULDN'T BE LONG AND THAT I SHOULD WANT THE PORRIDGE AFTER ALL
IN THAT CASE YOU ASK ANY LADY IN THE AUDIENCE TO THINK OF AN ODD NUMBER AND SHE SUGGESTS SHALL WE SAY 29
MOREOVER ON SET OCCASIONS PRINCE FREDERICK COULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY SPEECH
EXACTLY
BESIDES ONE WANTS TO SEE HOW THE OTHER FLOWERS ARE GETTING ON
THEN THE ICE BEGAN TO DRIP THROUGH THE PAPER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE UNDERNEATH PART OF THE DAILY NEWS HAD DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER
OR BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO SNEEZE AND HAS LOST HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
AND MORE PARTICULARLY UPON ONE RED ROOF WHICH STOOD UP AMID THE GREY-GREEN TREES
HA BARLOW I SAID DRAMATICALLY A TIME WILL COME WHEN WE SHALL BE LUNCHING IN THERE AND YOU_--BAH AND I TOSSED A POTTED-GROUSE SANDWICH TO HIS DOG
YES SHE WENT ON VERY DISTINCTLY AND SLOWLY I HOPE TO REMAIN UNDER YOUR ROOF UNTIL NEXT WEDNESDAY MORN
SHE HAD ASKED THE YOUNG MAN ON HER RIGHT IF SHE COULD HAVE SOME OF HIS SALT AND AS HE PASSED IT TO HER HE COVERED UP ANY EMBARRASSMENT SHE MIGHT BE FEELING BY SAYING GENIALLY WELL AND HOW LONG IS THIS COAL STRIKE GOING TO LAST I DON'T KNOW SAID ANNE TRUTHFULLY
THE WHOLE POINT IS WHY DID JENNY BRING ME HERE TO ENJOY YOURSELF SAID JENNY PROMPTLY
NO YOU MUST THINK OF SOME MORE SUBTLE WAY OF DISPOSING OF IT I'LL PRETEND IT'S YOURS SAID ANDREW MORE SUBTLY AND HE PLACED IT IN MY POCKET
BUT AFTER FIVE OR SIX APPLICATIONS THE SHOPKEEPER GRASPS ONE'S MEANING
SAMUEL WHAT'S YOUR AGE ASKED MYRA AT LAST
ANYHOW SHE ADDED YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE ME TO THE FLOWER SHOW NOW OF COURSE I WILL
REALLY I AM VERY MUCH IN YOUR DEBT
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THEY WERE ALL INTELLIGENT WELL-DRESSED AND READY FOR ANY SORT OF FUN
CHAPTER II CHAPTER II FINDS ME SOME MONTHS LATER AT HOME AGAIN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE REPLY TO THIS AND ESSENLAND MADE IT
FOR WE CANNOT LISTEN ALWAYS FOR THAT FLOP AND HEAR IT ALWAYS
I TOOK IT FROM HER AND LOOKED INSIDE
OH LOOK HERE DO YOU--OH YES I SEE
HOW PROUD WE ALL WERE
TOBY I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AS A NICE HORSE BUT HE HAD BEEN KNEE-DEEP IN MUD INSPECTING HUTS FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR AND WAS SICK OF BILLETING
THREE TIMES A DAY FROM NOW TILL MONDAY WEEK TEN PEERLESS DAYS IN ALL I TAKE MY STAND VESTED IN SOME DEGAGE MODE OF BREEK THE CHESS-BOARD TOUCH WITH SQUARES THAT ALMOST SPEAK AND LIGHTLY SKETCH MY SLICE INTO THE SAND AS BASED ON BIGGER MEN BUT MUCH OF IT UNIQUE
YOU'D BETTER SHE ADDED KINDLY TO ME
SEEING HIM COMING JASPER DROPPED HIS REVOLVER AND SLID DOWN THE SAIL INTO THE WINDOW
THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD GO HOSTESS
AND AS THEY WENT HI-YOU MURMURED TO HIS COMPANION THAT IT WAS QUITE ALL RIGHT FOR THAT IN ANY EVENT SHE COULD NOT EAT THEM THE WHICH ASSURANCE FREDERICK NO DOUBT WAS PECULIARLY GLAD TO RECEIVE
AND IN MY MORE HOPEFUL MOMENTS I SEE THE CONVERSATION GOING LIKE THIS WELL OH WONDERFUL WITH EMOTION REALLY WONDERFUL YOU SEE THEM ALL THERE YES YES
WE WANT A WAR TO BRACE US UP IT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN OLYMPUS THAT PORKINS MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
ANOTHER BIRD SAID CHIFF-CHAFF FROM ANOTHER TREE AND I THOUGHT IT WISE TO BE GENEROUS
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE FOR MY BULGARIANS ALWAYS TO GO ABOUT IN COMITADJIS
TO MY IMMENSE DELIGHT HOWEVER IT NEVER HESITATED BUT WENT STRAIGHT UP TO THE TOP
AND WHEN OUR OWN PARTICULAR BIT OF THE BATTLE IS OVER AND WHAT IS LEFT OF THE BATTALION IS MARCHING BACK TO REST I DOUBT IF EVEN IN ENGLAND WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR OFF YOU WILL FIND TWO PEOPLE MORE CONTENTED WITH THE MORNING THAN TOBY AND I AS WE JOG ALONG TOGETHER
WHEN SPADES ARE TRUMPS A HAND WITHOUT A SPADE SO IS MY BREAKFAST LACKING MARMALADE
BINGO CLAIMS OUR ATTENTION
THEY CAN FLY UP IF THEY LIKE
MANY OF THE GUESTS WERE GOING THROUGH SIMILAR SCENES OF RECOGNITION AND LOVE-MAKING
AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN THE HANDKERCHIEF FLARES UP YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXCITEMENT PRODUCED TO SUBSTITUTE THE ONE BASIN FOR THE OTHER
IT WOULD BE RATHER--I THINK PERHAPS--WELL THANKS VERY MUCH ONCE BEGUN THE BOOK FILLED UP RAPIDLY
SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT THE COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIS TAILOR BUT ENTIRELY UNSUSPICIOUS LORD SMITH GAVE HIM THE REQUIRED ADDRESS
THERE WAS NONE LEFT
I WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO THE GARDENER ABOUT LADY L
I WONDER WHO IT BELONGS TO AND IF IF HE'D LIKE TO GIVE IT TO US PERHAPS HE WOULD IF HE SAW US AND ADMIRED US VERY MUCH SAID CELIA HOPEFULLY
WE HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO
I CAN LEAVE IT IN ANOTHER CAB OR DROP IT IN THE RIVER ANDREW ANDREW I CRIED YOU'RE DETERMINED TO GO TO PRISON
IT WOULD BE RATHER LOVELY SAID MYRA THOUGHTFULLY
WHAT IS IT
AND WHEN WE ARE COME TO IT CELIA IS ALWAYS IN A PINK SUNBONNET GATHERING ROSES LOVINGLY AND I NOT VERY FAR OFF AM SPEAKING STRONGLY TO SOMEBODY OR OTHER ABOUT SOMETHING I WANT DONE
I SAID THAT MR BLANK'S ATTITUDE TO LIFE WAS SUBJECTIVE RATHER THAN OBJECTIVE
THEY HAD DONE THEIR CALISTHENICS SIDE BY SIDE
FIRE 10--2 THEY SAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEW RAGE HE SMILED REASSURINGLY AT HER
WITH A BEATING HEART HE UNPACKED HIS BAG AND SET OUT HIS SIMPLE BELONGINGS
JENNY THEN WE SHOULD HAVE LOST JENNY THIS BEING SO JENNY PROMISES SOLEMNLY NOT TO PLAY WITH ANY MINE THAT COMES ASHORE NOR TO LET RICHARD HENRY PLAY WITH IT NOR TO ALLOW IT TO PLAY WITH RICHARD HENRY NOR I SUPPOSE I MAY JUST POINT IT OUT TO HIM AND SAY LOOK THAT'S A MINE SAYS JENNY WISTFULLY
THAT IF SHE HAD TO WALK ON MUDDY PATHS IN HER EVENING SHOES IT WOULD BE AT THIS POINT MYRA SUDDENLY CAUGHT THE THREAD OF THE ARGUMENT
QUAE MENSAE BUT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NO GOOD ARGUING WITH HIM
LET US THEREFORE MEET AND RENEW OUR ENMITY JACQUES RISSOLE WROTE BACK TO GASPARD
INDEED HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT THAT THOSE WHO LOOKED UPON IT WERE BLINDED AS IF THEY HAD GAZED UPON THE SUN AT NOONDAY--OR SO THE COURT POET SAID AND HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO EXAGGERATE
NOW HE SAYS HE IS WRITING A PLAY--AND WE LOOK ROUND THE SPACIOUS LAWNS AND TERRACES AND MARVEL AT THE RUN HIS LAST ONE MUST HAVE HAD
IF HINDENBURG--BUT WE MUST GET TO WORK
GOOD-BYE I WENT AND BOUGHT ONE AND RETURNED TO HER WITH IT
THERE JUST INSIDE THE GATES WAS MARY
I CALL THE FIRST HOLDING THE LEMON FOR THIS TRICK YOU WANT A LEMON AND A PACK OF ORDINARY PLAYING-CARDS
AND FEELING THAT THAT WAS INADEQUATE ADDED TERRIBLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE COUNTRY ANNE CRUMBLED HER BREAD AND HAVING REVIEWED A SUCCESSION OF POSSIBLE REPLIES EACH MORE FATUOUS THAN THE LAST DECIDED TO REMAIN SILENT
RUINED
IT WENT FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLOP
BUT SINCE THEN I'VE HAD TIME TO THINK IT OVER AND I SEE THAT I WAS HASTY
THE GUESTS ARE ALL WAITING THEIR EYES FIXED IN EAGER ANTICIPATION ON THE BLACK-COVERED THRONE AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHEREON EACH POET WILL SIT TO DECLAIM HIS MASTERPIECE WHEN SUDDENLY LORD POLDOODLE IS OBSERVED TO BE MAKING HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY TOWARDS A SIDE-DOOR
AN EXCELLENT FELLOW BUT NOT ONE TO TAKE THESE SUDDEN FANCIES MR BARLOW
NEXT MORNING I STAYED IN BED AND THE DOCTOR CAME
AN OFFICER FROM HIS REGIMENT WHO HAD GONE OUT ALONE TO AN OBSERVATION POST HAD BEEN SURROUNDED AND CUT OFF BY THE ENEMY
HE MAY ALWAYS PICK UP SOMETHING IN THEM WHICH MAY BE USEFUL FOR HIS NEXT PLAY--IF YOU EVER READ YOUR SHAKESPEARE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS THIS PASSAGE
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND HE BEGAN
AS I WRITE THIS IN LONDON I HAVE SIMPSON'S ALBUM IN FRONT OF ME
LUCKILY JENNY COMES UP AND RESCUES HIM OTHERWISE THEY WOULD STILL BE AT IT
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND THE BATTLE HAS BEEN WON I'M GOING TO BUY A BARNACLE AND TAKE IT FOR A RUN
BUT IN THAT MOMENT OF PASSING WE HAD BEEN OBSERVED
BORACIC WHICH WAS FORGING HER WAY THROUGH THE MANAGER
HOWEVER ONE DOESN'T SAY THESE THINGS IN A REVIEW
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I HAVE COME TO FRANCE TO FIND THE MAN I LOVE MURGATROYD SAID THE COLONEL
I SUGGEST THAT WE PUBLISH IT IN HALF A DOZEN VOLUMES STOPPING FOR THE FIRST VOLUME AT THE PRESS NOTICES OF SAY PETER'S NOVEL
TALKING ABOUT WEDDING-RINGS SHE WENT ON AS SHE TWISTED HER OWN ROUND AND ROUND SHE'S GOT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WRITTEN INSIDE HERS--THE DATE AND THEIR INITIALS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THERE CAN'T BE MUCH ELSE--UNLESS PERHAPS SHE HAS A VERY LARGE FINGER WELL I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING IN MINE SAID CELIA MOURNFULLY
IT'S ME FOR BLIGHTY
NOT A SMALL TURKISH DOG AS CELIA THOUGHT BUT--WELL EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A WADI IS
IT'S AN ENGLISH COLONEL SAID THE NURSE
HE WAS PUSHING FAMILIAR EVERYTHING THAT I DISLIKED
A FRIEND OF MINE HAD TOLD HIS FRIENDS THE CARDEWS THAT WE WERE GOING OUT TO THE RIVIERA AND WOULD LET THEM KNOW WHEN WE ARRIVED
MEANWHILE LET US ALL ENJOY TOGETHER THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF BLIGHT HALL ALGERNON A FAIR YOUNG MAN WITH A MEANINGLESS EXPRESSION REPLIED SUITABLY
THERE SAID MY HOSTESS--"THERE'S THAT BIRD AGAIN SHE TURNED TO ME
WHAT DO YOU THINK CRIED CELIA BURSTING INTO MY ROOM ONE EVENING JUST WHEN I WAS WONDERING WHETHER MY READERS WOULD EXPECT TO KNOW MORE OF THE HEROINE'S NATIVE COSTUME THAN THAT IT WAS SIMPLE YET BECOMING WAIT A MOMENT I SAID
BUT I EXPECT SAMUEL TELEGRAPHED TO THEM TO MEET HIM UNDER THE CLOCK AT CHARING CROSS DISGUISED WHEN THEY WOULD HEAR OF SOMETHING TO THEIR ADVANTAGE
THE SECRET OF IT IS THAT YOU HAVE A SECOND BASIN WITH A PUDDING IN IT CONCEALED IN THE PALM OF YOUR RIGHT HAND
I HAVE BARELY BROUGHT TOGETHER AND CLASSIFIED MY ARRAY OF FACTS ABOUT THINGS IN THIS WORLD WHEN YOU'VE DASHED UP TO ANOTHER ONE
THAT'S ONLY THE THAT WAS YOUR AGE WHEN YOU MARRIED ME
CRAB HE MURMURS TO HIMSELF
OF COURSE A REALLY GOOD ACTOR CAN OFTEN GIVE A CLUE TO THE FEELINGS OF A CHARACTER SIMPLY BY FACIAL EXPRESSION
FANCY IF I GOT SIX PER CENT THIS IS A VERY SORDID CONVERSATION I SAID
AND SO ON FOR A BIT
GOOD LORD NO I SHALL BE HALF AN HOUR YET
WAITING FOR LIMPETS TO GO TO SLEEP IS DROWSY WORK
HAVING DISPOSED OF MY UNCLE'S BODY HE WOULD SAY TO THE STOUT LADY IN THE THIRD ROW OF THE STALLS I NOW HAVE LEISURE IN WHICH TO SEARCH FOR THE WILL
MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND--BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
I UNDERSTAND FROM THE CHANCELLOR THAT THE PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE SUBJECT SHORTLY WE HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING TO ANNOUNCE HAVE WE IT'S A PITY THAT YOU WERE SO HASTY WITH YOUR OTHER SUITORS SAID THE KING THOUGHTFULLY
WE CANNOT KEEP THE SECRET ANY LONGER FROM OUR READERS
SO FAR MY ONLY REAL TROUBLE HAS BEEN ONCE WHEN BILLETING
THREE EVENINGS LATER HE SHARED HIS HOLLANDAISE SAUCE WITH SOMEBODY IN YELLOW AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY WONDERING IF HE READ DICKENS
THE GREAT THING IS TO BE ABLE TO ASSURE SIMPSON AT LUNCH THAT THE CORSICAN QUESTION IS NOW CLOSED
I DID NOT MOURN THE YEARS FELL WORK UPON THOSE POOR OLD DEARS NOR PITT NOR VENUS DREW MY TEARS AND SET ME SLOWLY SOBBING
AND MRS PHILBY PHIPP HEARING THE NAME BRIGHTENED UP SUDDENLY AND SMILED AND SAID HOW ARE YOU MR BROWNIE?"--(BROWNIE
AND AS COMMANDANT OF A REST CAMP ON THE FRENCH COAST HE IS THE SOUL OF GENIALITY TO ALL WHO MEET HIM
YOU FORGET THEIR POCKET-MONEY LAST WEEK ONE TWO THREE--I CANNOT POSSIBLY AFFORD--ONE TWO THREE FOUR--MYRA I DO WISH YOU'D COUNT THEM DEFINITELY AND TELL ME HOW MANY WE HAVE
STRICTLY SPEAKING SAID MYRA SADLY YOU OUGHT TO HAVE GOT IT ON TO A NEW FILM SIMPSON LOOKED IN HORROR AT THE BACK OF HIS CAMERA FOUND THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TURN THE HANDLE APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY AND WOUND UP VERY GINGERLY TILL THE NUMBER 2 APPROACHED
YOU THOMAS DRIVE THE SUBMARINE
EVEN OUR NIGHTS WITH GRANTA EVEN THE STYLE THAT WEEK BY BLESSED WEEK MIXED CALVERLEY AND J.K
ALGERNON WOULD NOT BE DINING WITH US
IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR LATER THAT I FIRST GOT MIXED UP WITH THE THING
THE ANSWER IS PATRIOTISM THOSE DEEP FEELINGS FOR HIS COUNTRY WHICH ONE MAN WILL EXPRESS GLIBLY BY RISING NINE TIMES DURING THE MORNING AT THE SOUND OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM ANOTHER WILL DIRECT TO MORE SOLID USES
FORTUNATELY THE QUARTERMASTER HAD KEPT HIS BUTTONS
2-1/2D AND THE PROFESSOR THOUGHT FOURPENCE
I SEE YOUR POINT
HERE IT IS THE OTHERS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO PUZZLE OVER THE ANSWER MISS PHIPPS BEING UNUSUALLY FOOLISH EVEN FOR HER
MY OWN IMPRESSION IS THAT THEY ARE A SPECIES OF PLATOON
NO MAN SHALL EVER TASTE THE BLISS THAT I THIS BLESSED DAY DID WHEN ONE IS SIX ONE CANNOT TELL
DEAR SIR I ANSWERED DEFIANTLY NOW THAT WE ARE WRITING TO EACH OTHER I WISH TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT FOR MANY MONTHS PAST THERE HAS BEEN A CONSTANT FLOW OF ONE-FINGERED MUSIC FROM YOUR LITTLE BOY WHICH PENETRATES THROUGH THE FLOOR OF MY LIBRARY AND MAKES ALL WORK IMPOSSIBLE
YOU FIND ME VERY--YOU FIND ME--YOU FIND--GOOD HEAVENS WHAT IS IT SIR I DON'T FIND IT--I'VE LOST IT
DEAR HOBBS
I SIT HERE AND ASK MYSELF--WONDERINGLY
AN IMMOBILE SPAGHETTI
HE WRITES GAILY AND WITHOUT HESITATION ENTER LORD ARTHUR FLUFFINOSE AND ONLY THEN BEGINS TO BITE THE END OF HIS PENHOLDER AND GAZE ROUND HIS LIBRARY FOR INSPIRATION
I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS PART OF HIS SPORTING WAY BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT ABSURDLY ENOUGH HE ALSO WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS REALLY THE BETTER GOLFER OF THE TWO AND COULD AFFORD THESE AMENITIES
OF COURSE I HAD TO LIVE UP TO MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT
GRANT ME LEAVE AND HERE HIS BOSOM GAVE A HEAVE TO OFFER HIM MY BLESSING
OF COURSE I SAID AT LAST ONE MUST CONSIDER ONE'S HORSE
BOTHER I SAID
THE CAPTAIN TOOK HIM BY THE EAR AND GRADUALLY BROUGHT HIM NEAR THE COLONEL WHO WAS FAR FROM CLEAR BUT HEARD IT ALL POLITELY AND ASKED HIM TWICE YOU WANT A WHAT THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT HE DID NOT AND CHADD SALUTED QUITE A LOT AND PUT THE MATTER RIGHTLY
TUCKING THE LOBSTER UNDER MY ARM I TURNED THE BLOCK OVER SO THAT IT RESTED ON ANOTHER PART OF THE PAPER
P.M NOT A.M NOT AFTER BREAKFAST--GOOD
WHERE ARE MY MEN GOING WHERE IS MY BILLET WHERE'S C COMPANY'S MESS HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING FOR THE PIONEERS AND SO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS TO BE POPULAR
THERE REMAIN ONLY THE PROSPECTS OF MYSELF WHICH ARE FRANKLY ROTTEN
IT SEEMS THAT SOON AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS FIRST WIFE THE SIXTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT CONTRACTED A SECOND AND SECRET MARRIAGE TO ELLEN PODBY BY WHOM HE HAD ELEVEN SONS THE ELDEST OF WHOM IS NOW ASSERTING HIS RIGHT TO THE EARLDOM AND ESTATES
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS HERE TOO I SAID
AREN'T YOU EXCITED SHE SIGHED AND ADDED OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT SAMUEL IS YES
DO YOU WANT ME TO ORDER THAT IN COLD BLOOD FROM THE SHOPMAN HE WOULDN'T MIND
FOR THE LAST FORTNIGHT JOHN PENQUARTO HAD STOPPED COUNTING THE MONEY IN HIS BELT
CELIA SAID NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE USED TO LOOK AT ME CURIOUSLY SOMETIMES AND I FEAR THAT THE PROBLEM OF LIFE LEFT HER MORE PUZZLED THAN EVER
TO ME THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF HORSE
THE LOWER CLASSES SEEM TO HAVE NO SENSE OF DISCIPLINE NOWADAYS
WITH A FORCED SMILE HE BOWED JASPER OUT PLACED THE PACKET IN HIS SAFE AND RETURNED TO HIS DESK
I DO WISH YOU COULD SOLVE IT FOR US
I AIN'T A SINGER BUT I SINGS
WILL IT BE BIGGER THAN THE SEA
ODD VERSES HAVE CREPT IN ON THE UNANSWERABLE PLEA THAT IF THEY DIDN'T DO IT NOW THEY NEVER WOULD
AND THE YEARS ROLLED ON
WELL HE SAID WHAT ABOUT THE COAL STRIKE
BUT LITTLE MORE REMAINS TO TELL
AT MOST I CAN ASK TEN GUINEAS FOR MY LECTURE
PORKINS LIVES IN ENGLAND NOT ESSENLAND WAIT A MOMENT SAID THE OTHERS IN THE CAPITAL OF BOROVIA THE LEADER-WRITER OF THE BOROVIAN PATRIOT GOT TO WORK
AS SHE DRESSED TO GO TO THE DUCHESS OF BILBERRY'S AT HOME SHE WONDERED IF SHE WOULD EVER MEET JOHN PENQUARTO AGAIN AND IF HE HAD ALTERED
WE INTRODUCE OURSELVES AND SETTLE IN AND HAVE LUNCH
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY
NOW WHY SHOULD THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE FIFTEENTH PLATOON RIDE A HORSE WHEN THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE NINETEENTH HE REMINDED ME THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIXTEEN PLATOONS IN A BATTALION
ROSE I THINK WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVOURITE
A CAMERA HE SAID
ASKED TO SEE THE WEDDING-RING AND ADMIRED THE CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE AND GAVE A FEW HINTS ON THE PROPER WAY TO MANAGE A HUSBAND RATHER SAID CELIA
GOING TO SEE A CRAB ARE YOU MY LITTLE MAN SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN KINDLY
A DESPERATE STRUGGLE ENSUED
OH WE SAID
PARTICULARLY AS ONLY TWO OF THE CLOCKS GO
HOW TRUE SAYS THE HOSTESS
MYRA LET'S GO TO A FANCY-DRESS BALL WHEN WE GET BACK
TRY SPELLING IT
THOMAS YOU AND SIMPSON WON'T MIND THAT A BIT WILL YOU WE CAN'T TURN SAMUEL OUT OF HIS OWN HOUSE SAID MYRA INDIGNANTLY
OUTSIDE IN THE WELL-KEPT GROUNDS OF THE ESTATE WAS A NEW LAWN-MOWER
YOU HAVE STILL TO EXPLAIN HOW WE INVITE OURSELVES TO LUNCH WE DON'T
HE IS NOW GOING MANFULLY THROUGH BLEAK HOUSE"--A CHAPTER A NIGHT--AND WHEN HE CAME TO VISIT ME TO-DAY HE ASKED ME IF I HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MAN
YOU COULD GET"--I LOOKED AT HIM ALMOST WITH ADMIRATION--"YOU COULD GET TWO YEARS FOR THIS
AH SAID THE KING AS THEY WERE SHOWN INTO THE ROYAL LIBRARY THAT'S RIGHT HE TURNED TO THE PRINCESS
ONE ROCK AMID THE WELTER STANDS ON WHICH MY GAZE IS FIXED INTENTLY AN AFTER-LIFE IN QUIET LANDS LIVED VERY LAZILY AND GENTLY
WHAT'S HAPPENED SAID CELIA BREAKING A SILENCE WHICH HAD BECOME ALARMING
THE TWO STOUT LITTLE MEN GLARED FEROCIOUSLY AT EACH OTHER
OH I SAY DO STAY TO LUNCH HE SAID
UP TILL NOW HE HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOW THEM THE CALCEOLARIAS
I AM NOW QUITE RESPECTABLE IT GOES LIKE THIS HE SAID IGNORING MY APPEAL
YOU TOLD THEM THAT ABOUT HALF LONDON WAS COMING WE'RE ONLY SIX SAID MYRA BECAUSE I'VE JUST COUNTED AGAIN BUT WE SEEM ABOUT TWENTY IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT SAID SIMPSON CHEERFULLY
PERCY HE SAID
PRIVATE SMITHLORD MY DAUGHTER ROSAMUND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE
I'M NOT A SOLDIER NACHERAL NO MORE THAN MOST OF US TO-DAY
WE WERE SITTING IN THE LOGGIA AFTER WHAT I DON'T CALL BREAKFAST--ALL OF US EXCEPT SIMPSON WHO WAS BUSY WITH A MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE
I LET IT SINK IN
DICK OF DICK'S PROSPECTS THERE IS NO NEED TO SPEAK AT LENGTH
A SUBALTERN RIDING AT THE REAR OF A COLUMN OF SOLDIERS TROTTED UP TO THE CAPTAIN IN FRONT AND CHALLENGED HIM TO A GAME OF BILLIARDS FOR HALF A CROWN A SIDE THE LOSER TO PAY FOR THE TABLE
GOLLY
FOR AN HOUR PAST SIMPSON HAS BEEN COLLECTING HIS BELONGINGS
WHEREFORE HI-YOU WAS FILLED WITH A GREAT APPREHENSION AS HE WALKED TO THE PALACE AND FREDERICK TO WHOM THE MATTER HAD BEEN EXPLAINED WAS IT MAY BE PRESUMED EQUALLY STIRRED WITHIN ALTHOUGH OUTWARDLY IMPASSIVE
NO WONDER THEN THAT THE WIT FLOWED FAST AND FURIOUS AND THAT THE GUESTS ALL AGREED AFTERWARDS THAT THEY HAD NEVER SPENT SUCH A JOLLY CHRISTMAS AND THAT THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE HOSTS WAS SQUIRE TREGARTHEN
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU AND YOUR YOUNG MAN WOULD LIKE TO LIVE THERE INSTEAD MYRA LOOKED AT ME EAGERLY
DON'T WASTE HER
I BET HE'S HAVING US ON SAID THOMAS GLOOMILY AS HE STIRRED HIS COFFEE
THE TENSION WAS EXTREME
BUT ALL THE SAME ON THURSDAY LAST MY HEART WAS BEATING JUST AS FAST WITHIN THAT HALL OF WONDER
WE AREN'T TURNING HIM
IT IS QUITE SIMPLE
I MEAN--THACKERAY
DO YOU HAVE TO BUY THE DOVES TOO OR DO THEY JUST COME
MASTER WAS GOING WANDERING FROM TRENCH TO TRENCH MISTRESS FROM ONE PERSON'S HOUSE TO ANOTHER PERSON'S HOUSE
I WANT DOUBLE-NINE TWO THREE--SORRY
HE'S TO RING UP HIS SISTER
HE COMMANDED A FRONTIER FORT ON THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN RURITANIA AND ESSENLAND AND HIS CHIEF AMUSEMENT IN A DULL LIFE WAS TO PLAY CARDS WITH THE ESSENLAND CAPTAIN WHO COMMANDED THE FORT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
AND THEN YOU CAN MARRY MY DAUGHTER AT THESE WORDS HYACINTH AND RICHARD WERE LOCKED IN A CLOSE EMBRACE
JUST THREEPENNYWORTH SHE PLEADED
AND A VERY SENSIBLE ONE BUT DO YOU WANT FREDERICK AS A SON-IN-LAW WELL THAT'S THE QUESTION
MY DEAR THIS IS WONDERFUL I SAID
FROM LOW-HUNG SKIES THE DAWN MAY RISE BROODINGLY ON STONEHENGE
THIS WENT ON FOR SOME DAYS
ROTTEN
IN SHORT HE IS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECITING HIS OWN WORKS IN FRONT OF THE FAIR THE RICH AND THE HIGHLY BORN AND MAKING WHAT HE CAN OUT OF IT IN THE WAY OF ADVERTISEMENT
I SUPPOSE THEY'RE ALL JUST AS MUCH ALIVE AS WE ARE SHE SAID THOUGHTFULLY
I CAN BLOW AWAY THE SHELLS IN FRONT AND THE SHELLS FROM THE RIGHT BUT IF MASTER'S MAP IS CORRECT WE'RE GOING TO GET ENFILADED FROM THE LEFT AS WELL AND ONE CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE
ANYTHING I LIKE
AT NINETEEN-STONE-NINE I REALIZED THAT I HAD OVERDONE IT
THE COMPETITION SPIRIT ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO A CANADIAN GENTLEMAN NAMED SMITH ARRIVED IN THE OLD COUNTRY ENGLAND HE KNEW A MAN WHO KNEW A MAN WHO KNEW A MAN
AND SOMETIMES THE PRINCESS AMARIL WOULD HELP HIM AT HIS WORK
THE DOG MY INFORMANT TOLD ME WAS VERY UNWILLING TO GO OVER THE SAME GROUND TWICE AND YET BEING IN A HURRY WISHED TO TAKE THE SHORTEST JOURNEY POSSIBLE
WELL MR PENQUARTO SAID THE SMILING PUBLISHER I MAY SAY AT ONCE THAT WE LIKE YOUR NOVEL
SO ON WEDNESDAY IT WENT
BUT I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR SOMETHING MORE DIFFICULT
YES THAT'S RIGHT
I AS HIS OLDEST FRIEND SHALL WATCH HIM TO SEE THAT HE DOES IT
WHEN I TAKE MY BATH IN THE MORNING THE AUDIENCE WAKES UP WITH A START
ALAS NO
BUT NOT IN D COMPANY
WHY OH WHY I SHOULD GROAN DID I MAKE THE SCORER PUT THAT BYE DOWN AS A HIT SUPPOSE IT WERE THIRTY-FOUR
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OTHERS OF COURSE MORE LOCAL COLOUR WAS WANTED THAN A MERE WATTLE OR TWO
AND YET
AND YET
PALMS OF THE GREAT NO
HOW BEAUTIFUL
WHO STRUGGLES WITH THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
SUBALTERNS FROM OTHER COMPANIES USED TO CALL ROUND FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING FUNNY
BLOW BUGLE BLOW
WHAT MAN HAS DONE MAN CAN DO THAT EVENING THE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT GAVE ORDERS FOR ELEVEN SPARE BEDROOMS TO BE GOT READY
ON THE CONTRARY WE SEEMED TO LOSE OUR TASTE FOR MUSIC AND WHEN AT LAST WE WERE RESTORED TO OUR PIANOLA WE FOUND THAT WE HAD GROWN OUT OF IT
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT I HOPED SHE WOULDN'T BUT I COULD HARDLY SAY SO
JENNY SAID THAT OF COURSE HE COULDN'T REALLY BE BECAUSE THE KING GAVE HIM A MEDAL FOR NOT BEING ONE BUT MOTHER EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS ONLY A MEDAL HE HAD OVER AND FATHER HAPPENED TO BE PASSING BY THE WINDOW
IS IT AGREED THEN IT WAS AGREED
CELIA WAS LYING ON HER--I NEVER KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS NICELY--WELL SHE WAS LYING FACE DOWNWARDS ON A ROCK AND GAZING INTO A LITTLE POOL WHICH THE TIDE HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT AND LEFT BEHIND
HE EXPECTS ONE TO SAY MR BLANK'S TREATMENT OF HILDA'S RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND IS MASTERLY WHEREAS WHAT ONE WANTS TO SAY IS PUTTING MR BLANK'S BOOK ON ONE SIDE WE MAY CONSIDER THE LARGER QUESTION WHETHER AND SO CONSIDER IT ALONE TO THE END OF THE COLUMN
A MOUSTACHE SUITS YOU MY WIFE DOESN'T THINK SO I SAID FIRMLY
CAPTAIN BOLSOVER MADE IT COME TO LL 3S
GAD SAID A SPORTING SUBALTERN WHO IN PEACE DAYS HAD FREQUENTLY ENTERED FOR A DERBY SWEEPSTAKE AT THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB THE BEGGAR CAN RIDE--WHAT AN ANSWERING CHEER RANG OUT FROM ALL RANKS
WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU TO HEAR HE ASKED THAT THE PRESIDENT OF CZECHO-SLOVAKIA HAS A VERY LONG BEARD IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN GOATS I MURMURED TO MYSELF
DON'T MOVE
STILL MORE EARNESTLY HE HAD BEGGED US TO SEE CORSICA
FORGET ALL ABOUT THAT MOTHER
BLESS YOU
THE SKYLARK TRIUMPHS FROM THE BLUE ABOVE THE BARLEY FIELDS AT LOO THE BLACKBIRD WHISTLES LOUD AND CLEAR UPON THE HILLS AT WINDERMERE
AND THOUGH AT PRESENT IT DID NOT SEEM GREATLY ALARMED FEELING CONVINCED THAT IT WAS ONLY ASSISTING AT ANOTHER CINEMATOGRAPH REHEARSAL ITS SUSPICIONS MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BE AROUSED
WE FIND THESE THINGS AS SIMPSON SAID VERY JOLLY TO LOOK BACK ON
THE GENERAL INCLINED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE TWO OF THEM AND SAID SPEAK SLOWLY PLEASE OR SHOUT INSTEAD
HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK WELL I AM RATHER THIRSTY I SAID AND I TOOK OUT A PENCIL
AND EVEN IF I DIDN'T REALLY DO IT ALL MYSELF HE SAID ANYHOW I DID MAKE SOME OF THE MEN IN THE TRENCH SMILE A LITTLE THAT MORNING AND THERE WASN'T SO VERY MUCH SMILING GOING ON JUST THEN YOU KNOW AFTER THAT MORNING HE LIVED IN MY POCKET SOMETIMES SNIFFING AT AN EMPTY PIPE SOMETIMES TRYING TO READ LETTERS FROM MISTRESS WHICH JOINED HIM EVERY DAY
HUMPHREY I FORGOT TO SAY HAS A SQUEAK IF KICKED IN THE RIGHT PLACE
WHY IS THE FAT WOMAN'S FACE SO RED
HAM TO BE OR NOT TO BE AND SO ON IN THE SAME VEIN FOR SOME THIRTY LINES
DIX-SEPT HE SAID
LET ME NOW GET TO THE TRICKS
IT WON'T DO TO WRITE LIKE THIS ENTER LORD ARTHUR
I ONLY JUST BLOWED A GERM AT HIM HE SAID WISTFULLY--"ONE I FOUND IN HIS POCKET
PICTURESQUE VILLAS CURIOUS EFFECTS OF ROCKS DISTANT BACKGROUNDS OF MOUNTAIN
YES I BEGAN MECHANICALLY TO HELP MYSELF TO PORRIDGE AND THEN STOPPED
I FORGOT THE SUBALTERN
I WROTE THESE THINGS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND--WELL HERE THEY ARE
PRIVATELY HE THINKS THAT IT HAS BEEN OVER-RATED
CHAPTER III CHAPTER III FINDS THE WAR OVER AND CELIA STILL AT IT
IT IS NOT ONLY A PLEASURE BUT A DUTY
AREN'T YOU EXCITED WHISPERED MYRA TO ME
I FORGET WHICH
PROBABLY THE LARGE BLOCK IN FRONT OF ME WAS JUST A TRADE SIGN LIKE THE COLOURED BOTTLES AT THE CHEMIST'S
IT'S ONLY SOME NONSENSE OF BLAKE'S SIR HE SAID
AND FOR HIS ONE-HOLE VICTORY IN THE MORNING I HAD MY REVENGE WITH A ONE-HOLE VICTORY IN THE AFTERNOON
HOW DO YOU DO HE BEAMED
I WOULD BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN AND WOULD DO IT PROPERLY THIS TIME
WE LUNCHED OUTSIDE STOPES
THESE GODS LOOKED DOWN ON US AND SMILED TO SEE HOW UTTERLY A CHILD BY SIMPLE THINGS MAY BE BEGUILED TO HAPPINESS AND LAUGHTER
THIS WANTS THINKING ABOUT SO HE DIVED HEAD DOWNWARDS INTO THE DEEPEST RECESSES OF MY POCKET AND ABANDONED HIMSELF TO THOUGHT
WHY LORD ARTHUR
ONE--AND--SIXPENCE OF COURSE SAID MISS PHIPPS
QUICK A WORD TO BEGIN WITH E
THE MARRIAGE OF COURSE WOULD NOT BE ANNOUNCED UNTIL UNTIL THE ENCHANTER HAD REMOVED HIS SPELL FROM THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE QUITE SO
SUPERFICIALLY THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN AN ORANGE AND A POLAR BEAR
HAVE YOU BEEN STUDYING THIS COAL STRIKE QUESTION AT ALL HE BEGAN
BUT COMETH WOULD BE DIFFICULT I DON'T SEE WHY SAID HERBERT
I DON'T SEE WHAT THIS HAS TO DO WITH IT SAID FATHER
JOHN IT WAS MARY SPEAKING
YOU MUST MAKE THE EVOLUTIONS SEEM NATURAL
THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST I TAKE IT THAT EVERY ABLE-BODIED MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY WANTS TO WRITE A PLAY
SHE NO DOUBT WOULD TAKE COMMON WITH HER
HE IS A CAPTAIN IN THE YEOMANRY AND HAS TACKLED BIGGER JOBS THAN THIS IN HIS TIME
THE WORST THAT THE MACHINE COULD TELL ME WAS TWENTY-STONE-SEVEN
THE WORKS YOU PLACE IN AN ORDINARY PUDDING BASIN AND PROCEED TO POUND UP WITH A HAMMER
YOU CAN'T SHOW PEOPLE THE GERANIUMS YOU CAN SAY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FOR A GERANIUM SAID CELIA
FIRE RICHARD WHO WAS PASSING SOHO SQUARE AT THE TIME HEARD THE CRY AND DASHED INTO THE BURNING HOUSE
I FEAR WE HAVE LOST HIM ALGERNON SAID THE COUNTESS IN SURPRISE
I TOOK THE PAPER WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND READ
WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE DONE ANYTHING_--EXCEPT ENJOY OURSELVES
HAVE A CIGAR--IF YOU'VE BROUGHT ANY WITH YOU FORTUNATELY HE HAD BROUGHT SEVERAL WITH HIM
IT'S QUITE A SOLID LITTLE TABLE
CADDIE GIVE ME MY DRIVER CADDIE LET US AWAY WITH THOUGHTS LIKE THESE
BUT THE DAY OF RECKONING WAS AT HAND
WHENEVER BINGO WANTS EXERCISE HUMPHREY PLANTS HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HIS EYES CAST UPWARDS IN AN AFFECTATION OF INNOCENCE
MY OFFERS FIRST OF AN OLD STOCKING AND AFTERWARDS OF MINES MORTGAGES AND AERATED BREADS WERE REJECTED AT ONCE
THAT LOOKS RIPPING SAID SIMPSON
PHYLLIS THE PROSPECTS OF THIS PLAYER ARE FROM HER OWN POINT OF VIEW BRIGHT AS SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FIELD FOR TWO HOURS A DAY TO THE BELOVED DICK
I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY HARM IN THAT SAYS FATHER
JASPER HAD LET THE LION LOOSE
WELL NOT EXACTLY CARELESSLY
HENRY'S NOVEL WOULD BE ABOUT A BOY CALLED THOMAS WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND WHO CAME TO LONDON AND WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT A BOY CALLED STEPHEN WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND WHO CAME TO LONDON AND WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT A BOY CALLED MICHAEL WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND WHO CAME TO LONDON AND WROTE A NOVEL ABOUT A BOY CALLED PETER WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND
THERE WOULD BE LOUD CHEERS FROM ALL THE COMPANY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE MAN WHO HAD PUT FIVE FRANCS ON SIXTEEN AND HAD SHOT HIMSELF AND WE SHOULD BE CARRIED--THAT IS TO SAY WE FOUR MEN--SHOULDER HIGH TO THE DOOR WHILE BY THE DESERTED TABLE MYRA AND DAHLIA CLUNG TO EACH OTHER WEEPING TEARS OF HAPPINESS
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU COUNTED CALL IT FORTY-FIVE THEN
INDEED IT WAS JUST ABOUT TO OCCUR TO ME
WE OTHERS WE WOULD STUFF OUR POCKETS TOO
LEFT ALONE OUR HERO GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THOUGHT
DUNCAN FASHIONED MY WRIST-WORK LADDIE TAYLOR TAUGHT ME TO TWIST MY KNEES
REALLY I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE I COULD HAVE DONE
THEY DON'T TELL YOU--THEY DON'T TELL YOU
I REALLY DID TRY BUT FOR MONTHS I COULDN'T GET THOSE RATS IN
OH HAS SHE I SAID BITTERLY
NO I WOULD BEAR IT GRIMLY
I WANT A CHARGE OF OUR OWN MEN ART I SAID GRANDLY KNOWS NO FRONTIERS I SUPPOSE THIS HAS BEEN SAID BY SEVERAL PEOPLE SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY BUT FOR THE MOMENT BOTH CELIA AND I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER CLEVER
SIMPSON HAD TOLD US THAT WE MUST SEE THE VILLAGE
THERE YOU ARE I SAID TRIUMPHANTLY
SAY TEN THOUSAND POUNDS
THEY MET AGAIN AND AGREED TO INSULT EACH OTHER WEEKLY
THUS WE ARE AT WORK TOGETHER
MALLORY THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE ON THE WHOLE ENCOURAGING
IT IS A HARD THING TO SAY OF ANY MAN BUT HE APPEARED TO ME TO BE ENTIRELY LACKING IN INTELLECT
IT IS A HARD THING TO SAY OF ANY MAN BUT HE APPEARED TO ME TO BE ENTIRELY LACKING IN INTELLECT
I DECIDED TO BECOME A LIEUTENANT
NOW I DON'T SAY I'M MORE VALUABLE THAN A PLATOON-COMMANDER OR MORE EFFECTIVE ON A HORSE BUT AT ANY RATE THERE AREN'T SIXTEEN OF ME
I POINTED OUT THAT THE COUNTRY WANTED BRISTLES
HOWEVER HE ASKS POLITELY WHAT'S A CRAB YOU'LL SEE DIRECTLY DARLING SAYS JENNY
HIS CLUBS TEN LITTLE DAYS LIE BLEACHING WHERE SEA-POPPIES BLOW TEN DAYS AND WHEELING SEA-BIRDS MEW
FOR THE TRICKS I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED IT WAS SUFFICIENT THAT THE AMATEUR PRESTIDIGITATOR I SHALL ONLY SAY THIS ONCE MORE SHOULD KNOW HOW IT WAS DONE
E.G THE TWELFTH
I SWORE TOO
IF MY LECTURE ON FIRST PRINCIPLES IN HOMOEOPATHY IS EVER TO BE DELIVERED IT MUST BE DELIVERED ELSEWHERE
THERE WERE TWO WOMEN IN A TOWN THE ONE WAS BLONDE THE OTHER BROWN
NO GIVING AWAY ANYTHING NO WAIVING THE RULES
BESIDES IF HE SAW US TOGETHER HE'D PROBABLY KNOW
WHETHER TIS NOBLER AND SO ON
THERE'S ONLY ONE SIGNALLING OFFICER AND IF THERE IS A SPARE HORSE OVER WHAT ABOUT THE BOMBING OFFICER SAID O.C
AND WE HAD A VERY HAPPY EVENING
THE SECRET DOCUMENT WAS IT VERY IMPORTANT SIR IMPORTANT CRIED THE COLONEL
ALSO ON PROBATION THEY WERE GOOD STARS NONE BETTER IN THE SERVICE
TO PICTURE TO YOU HIS PRIDE AT THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SIX FREE COPIES AND HIS LANDLADY'S SURPRISE WHEN HE PRESENTED HER WITH ONE
AND THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WIPED HIS SPECTACLES VIGOROUSLY
EVEN NOW PERHAPS IT IS NOT TOO LATE
WHEN I SAID MEREDITH I WAS THINKING OF THE OTHERS
OH OO'S FOR DEAR OLD ENGLAND'S SHORES AND BY-AND-BY SOUTHAMPTON COMES BLIGHTY I SAYS AND ROARS
NO DOUBT I AM
RECENTLY A NEW AND LESS EXPENSIVE METHOD OF ENTERTAINING GENIUS HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE IN THE BEST CIRCLES AND THE ASPIRING POET IS NOW INVITED TO THE HOUSE OF THE GREAT NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARTAKING OF BODILY REFRESHMENT HIMSELF BUT IN ORDER THAT HE MAY AFFORD SPIRITUAL REFRESHMENT TO OTHERS
AND THEN ADDED PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER PUT IT IN THOUGH OF COURSE I MISSED
THERE WERE FOUR LADIES
SO I RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY
BUT SHE WAS WRONG
THEY HAD LOOKED OVER THE SAME ALGEBRA BOOK OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT CELIA LEARNT AT SCHOOL--I HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE CERTAIN
II RICHARD HAD BEEN IN PRISON A MONTH BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIS ESCAPE OCCURRED
I HAPPENED TO BE MENDING A TELEPHONE LINE IN THIS PARTICULAR TRENCH ONE THIRSTY DAY AND THERE WAS THE DUG-OUT AND--WELL THERE WAS I
A SMALL PIECE OF DRY TOAST I SUPPOSE THE MACHINE COULDN'T HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IT SEEMED VERY DECIDED ABOUT IT
JOHNNY QUITE SAW THIS
OUR OFFICERS ARE GOOD LADS AND A CREDIT TO THE DEAR OLD REGIMENT"--THEY SALUTED AS BEFORE--"BUT IN A MATTER OF THIS SORT ONE CANNOT BE TOO DISCREET YOU ARE RIGHT COLONEL THE COLONEL LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM APPREHENSIVELY AND BROUGHT HIS CHAIR A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MAJOR
YES CALLED AFTER HIS DADDY WHERE IS DADDY NOW ASKED RICHARD HOARSELY
TO THE DEATH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY MANNER CAULIFLOWER SHRIEKED GASPARD VOLAUVENT ACROSS THE LITTLE TABLE IN THE ESTAMINET
HIS CONSCIENCE WAS GNAWING HIM
I MEAN OF COURSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE BUT IT ISN'T ONLY THAT
THE VICAR HAD SAID JOHNNY WILL NEVER DO ANY GOOD AT POLWOLLOP I FEAR
HE PRESSED AND FOOZLED BADLY
WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND I DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY STORY TO THE PALESTINE FRONT
AND SOME SAY THAT IT WAS THE PRINCESS AMARIL WHO PLANNED IT FROM THE DAY WHEN FIRST SHE SAW HI-YOU AND WITH THEM I AGREE
HIS PROSPECTS HOWEVER ARE CERTAINLY IMPROVED THIS SEASON AS HE WILL BE QUALIFIED TO BOWL FOR THE WHOLE TWO HOURS BUT ONLY ON THE DISTINCT UNDERSTANDING WITH PHYLLIS THAT HE DOES HIS OWN FIELDING FOR HIMSELF
YOURS EVER SAMUEL P.S.--I HAVE ASKED THOMAS TOO WELL SAID MYRA EAGERLY AS I GAVE HER BACK THE LETTER
YOU DON'T SHOOT SNIPE FROM HORSEBACK I SAID SHARPLY
HOSTESS TO GUEST GOOD-BYE
THE SCENT OF THE MIMOSA INSPIRED HIM
MR
SERPENT REPLIED JACQUES RISSOLE BRISTLING WITH EQUAL DEXTERITY
THE BISHOP OF SPLOSHINGTON
WHATEVER A SLUG-TRAP I EXPLAINED PROUDLY
MY ONLY HOPE WAS THAT OUR HOST WOULD ASK ME IF I HAD BEEN TO THE ZOO LATELY BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHY HE SHOULD
IT HAPPENED IN THIS WAY
IF WE ONLY HAD HAD PERCY HERE SIGHED THE EARL
AT LEAST TO BE CERTAIN OF
THE NOISE OF OUR CONVERSATION HAD ROUSED IT BUT A GENTLE STROKING MOTION I AM TOLD BY THOSE TO WHOM IT HAS CONFIDED WILL FREQUENTLY CAUSE ITS MUSCLES TO RELAX
AS SOON AS THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND HIM JASPER RE-ENTERED SOFTLY DRUGGED ANDREW HASTILY AND TOOK POSSESSION AGAIN OF THE COMPROMISING DOCUMENTS
YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A PIANOLA
THANK YOU SAMUEL FOR BRINGING US SAID DAHLIA GENTLY
BUT I SHOULD PREFER TO BE SENTIMENTAL IN SOME OTHER LANGUAGE THAN PLAIN ENGLISH
I TOOK OFF AN OUNCE
MR BELLINGHAM WAS BATHING HIS FOREHEAD WITH COOLING DRINKS
WILLIAM TREWULLIAM--THE FIRST PHASE BY JOHN PENQUARTO 7-1/2 BY 5-1/4 896 PP ALBERT PUMP
YES FATHER IT IS I SHE REPLIED SIMPLY
NOTHING CAN SAVE US SAID ARCHIE
THEN YOU INVITE ANY GENTLEMAN IN THE AUDIENCE TO THINK OF A NUMBER
BUT MENTION OF THE TWO NUMBERS REMINDS ME OF A TRICK WHICH I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
WE FOUND HIS BALL IN A THICK CLUMP OF HEATHER
I'M--I'M AFRAID YOU HAD YOUR HAND OVER THE LENS SAMUEL DEAR OUR NEW PHOTOGRAPHIC SERIES
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I SAID BUT DON'T SAY IT
IT'S NOT WORTH IT
I'VE JUST RUN DOWN TO TELL LORD LARKSPUR TO MISS D
GEORGE ROSAMUND CRIED GEORGE
THE SPECIAL BREED OF SALMON I ONLY KNOW WE LOVED WE LOVED THAT MAYONNAISE
I SHALL BE HORRIBLY LATE
IMMEDIATELY THEY WERE UPROOTED
I HAVEN'T BEEN SO EXCITED SINCE I RECOGNIZED A CALCEOLARIA LAST YEAR AND TOLD MY HOST IT WAS A CALCEOLARIA JUST BEFORE HE TOLD ME
FOR WE MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO SHE READ IT WITH STARTING EYES
BOBBY IS TWELVE--FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN DICK
WHILE ON ONE NOTABLE OCCASION THE EARL OF BLIGHT TOOK ALGERNON INTO THE DINING-ROOM AT ABOUT 11.31 IN THE MORNING AND HELPED HIM TO A GLASS OF SHERRY AND A SLICE OF SULTANA CAKE
IT'S AS GOOD A WAY OF LOSING AS ANY OTHER SAID ARCHIE
LISTEN AND I HELD UP A FINGER
HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK I HAD A LIME JUICE
THAT ON AND AFTER THE 23RD OF THE MONTH MEN IN CATEGORY X3 ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN CATEGORY X2 MY GOD GASPED THE MAJOR IF HINDENBURG KNEW HE MUST NOT KNOW MAJOR SAID THE COLONEL SIMPLY
AND NOW WE COME TO WHAT IS MEANT BY STAGECRAFT
SIMPSON'S MURMURED ARCHIE
E FOR EDITH THAT'S THE SECOND SISTER WHOSE NAME I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU
WHY RAKE UP THE PAST
A SIMPLE CALCULATION SHOWS THAT WE ARE PERCHED ON THE FIFTH FLOOR
THEN I WAS BAFFLED
IT WAS DARK BEFORE THE SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE AND JOINED THE OTHERS AT THE DINNER-TABLE
IS IT MURKY
SHE SAYS SHE CANNOT PLAY GOLF WITH YOU TO-MORROW BECAUSE SHE IS PLAYING WITH SECOND-LIEUTENANT LORD SMITH HE SALUTED AND WITHDREW
ONE ON EACH SHOULDER
HOWEVER AFTER WE HAD DECIDED TO CALL HIM BINGO A DIFFICULTY AROSE
IT'S REALLY--WONDERFUL
LIBERTY WHAT CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN THY NAME MURMURS LORD POLDOODLE TO HIMSELF
I KNEW YOU MEANT SOMETHING
HE WAS SHOWING QUALITIES WHICH COULD NOT FAIL WHEN HE GREW UP TO BE OF VALUE TO THE NATION
BUT IN THAT CASE I DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW YOU WOULD DO IT
JUST TELL HIM TO RING UP HIS SISTER AND I LOOKED AT CELIA TRIUMPHANTLY
I HATE PET DOGS
NOW TAKE COAL AT THE PIT'S MOUTH HE WENT ON--"AT THE PIT'S MOUTH_"--HE SHOOK A FOREFINGER AT HER--"AT THE PIT'S MOUTH_--AND I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT_--THE ROYALTIES THE ROYALTIES ARE IT'S AWFUL SAID ANNE
I DID
WHERE IS IT AND WHY THE BLANKTOWN LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY ASK ME TO LECTURE TO THEM AT BLANKTOWN
YES SHE SAID AS IF IN A TRANCE IF ANYTHING FELL UPON HIM FROM HERE AND SHE GAVE HER HUSBAND A THOUGHTFUL PUSH--"IT--IS--QUITE--POSSIBLE--THAT AT THE WORD THAT THE EARL REACHED PERCY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE TITLE EXPIRED
WE ALL HAVE ONE SPECIAL BOOK OF OUR OWN WHICH WE RECOMMEND TO OUR ACQUAINTANCES REGARDING THE LOVE OF IT AS PERHAPS THE BEST PASSPORT TO OUR FRIENDSHIP
BUT THERE WAS NOW A NEW KIND OF LETTER TO WRITE AND ONE RATHER OUTSIDE THE TERMS OF OUR ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING
ARE YOU SURE YOU STAND ON IT LONG ENOUGH LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
EVEN UNDER THIS DISGUISE SHE RECOGNIZED THAT EARLY MEETING
ROSAMUND HE CRIED AM I SO GREATLY CHANGED THE COLONEL HANDED HIM HIS POCKET MIRROR
INDEED IF WE LITERARY AND ARTISTIC STRUGGLERS WERE NOT ASKED OUT TO AFTERNOON TEA SOMETIMES BY OUR MILLIONAIRE ACQUAINTANCES IT IS DOUBTFUL IF WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE
HAVE YOU WRITTEN ANY WHILE WE'VE BEEN HERE I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD ANYTHING TO WRITE I THINK I SAID REPROACHFULLY IT'S QUITE TIME YOU WROTE TO YOUR--YOUR BANK OR YOUR MOTHER OR SOMEBODY SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SEEMED TO BE STRUGGLING FOR WORDS
THIS NOVEL UNDOUBTEDLY PLACES THE AUTHOR IN THE FRONT RANK OF LIVING NOVELISTS WILLIAM'S NOVEL WOULD BE A REALISTIC ACCOUNT OF--YES THAT WAS IT--OF A BOY CALLED HENRY WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND WHO CAME TO LONDON AND WROTE A NOVEL A NOVEL OF WHICH THE MORNING POST SAID
COME ON I SAID GETTING UP AND GIVING A HAND TO MYRA
IT WASN'T TYPICAL
I COULD NOT HELP BUT LEAVE THE RANKS
THERE ARE CERTAIN CONSONANTS IN IT WHICH REQUIRE TO BE ELIDED OR SWALLOWED OR SWIVELLED ROUND THE GLOTTIS IN ORDER TO GIVE THE NAME ITS PROPER DUE
MEN OF LETTERS III
THE NEED FOR SELF-EXPRESSION COMES STRONGLY UPON THE ARTIST AT A TIME LIKE THIS HE SAID
IN AMERICA CAN'T YOU SEE THE LIKENESS WHISPERED RICHARD TO MR BELLINGHAM
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE READY FOR THE REVOLUTION
NEVER MIND ABOUT THE NAME
WHO WAS THE LION-TAMER COULD IT BE JASPER
WITH GREAT GENEROSITY I ALLOWED HER TO PLACE IT IN THE SLIT
ON AN ORDINARY COOL DAY IT IS ABOUT HALF A MILE TO THE FISHMONGER
INDEED THE ONLY WAY
LET US SUPPOSE HE THINKS OF 38
FORTUNATELY THE BIRD LESSER-BUNTED AGAIN AND I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF PLAYING FOR SAFETY
WE MUST WRITE TO MR BARLOW SAID CELIA DECISIVELY
DEAR SIR,--I AM PREPARED TO LEND YOU ANYTHING FROM L10 TO L10,000 ON YOUR NOTE-OF-HAND ALONE
JUST SO HE OFTEN USED TO THINK WOULD HE HAVE FELT TOWARDS A BROTHER IF THIS HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM
THE LAST STRAW IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SUMMER EVENINGS WITH THE CHILL ON SO AFTER DINNER WE LIT THE SMOKING-ROOM FIRE AND WONDERED WHAT TO DO
LET US ON AND HAVE IT OVER
HENRI CAME TO SEE ME WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM
SHE FIELDS JOLLY WELL THOUGH WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER HIS BOWLING DAYS ARE RATHER OVER
THE ETIQUETTE IS TO HAVE TWO BITES BEFORE THE BUTLER AND THE THREE FOOTMEN WHISK AWAY THE PLATE
I MEAN"--SHE WRINKLED HER FOREHEAD IN THE EFFORT TO FIND WORDS FOR HER THOUGHTS--"I'M WONDERING WHAT EVERYTHING MEANS AND WHY WE'RE ALL HERE AND WHAT LIMPETS ARE FOR AND SUPPOSING THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MARS IF WE'RE THE REAL PEOPLE WHOM THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR OR IF THEY ARE SHE STOPPED AND ADDED ONE EVENING AFTER DINNER WHEN WE GET HOME YOU MUST TELL ME ALL ABOUT EVERYTHING CELIA HAS A BEAUTIFUL IDEA THAT I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO HER
AT THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN ONE OF THEM HE SHUDDERED VIOLENTLY
IN DEEP THOUGHT I BUTTERED A PIECE OF TOAST
SO WE RETIRED TO A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS A WEIGHING-MACHINE IN THE BATHROOM
IF YOU'LL BE QUIET A MOMENT I'LL TELL YOU SOME THESE WERE SOME OF THE THINGS
MILNE
WITH THE TEN IN YOUR HAND TOGETHER THERE IS ALWAYS A TEMPTATION TO WASTE THEM IN ONE WILD RUSH OF FLIPPERTIES ALL CATCHING EACH OTHER UP
I SAW MESELF A-GETTING FIT WITH MISSIS AT THE LITTLE SHOP
READ THAT WITH A GROAN HE BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AGAIN
AMERICA I SUPPOSE SO SAID ANNE GLOOMILY
WHEN I GOT HOME TO DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY WITH THE SUBALTERN I FOUND A LETTER FROM NORAH WAITING FOR ME
I CANNOT FLY THEN I WIN SAID JACQUES SIMPLY
THE WEEKS I'VE LIVED IN VAIN
I ASKED HER BECAUSE IN A GENERAL WAY MY BOWLING IS HELD TO BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF GIRLS OF FIFTEEN
ONLY IF THE LORD MAYOR'S THERE BUT HOW WILL YOU KNOW YES THAT'S RATHER AWKWARD
A FEW TRICKS FOR CHRISTMAS IN THE MANNER OF MANY CONTEMPORARIES NOW THAT THE FESTIVE SEASON COPYRIGHT IS APPROACHING IT BEHOVES US ALL TO PREPARE OURSELVES IN SOME WAY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GAIETY OF THE CHRISTMAS HOUSE-PARTY
BUT ONCE AGAIN THEY WERE ALL WRONG
NATURALLY AS THIS IS A FIRST BOOK WE CAN ONLY PAY A NOMINAL SUM ON ACCOUNT OF ROYALTIES
AND CELIA WHO WAS ALWAYS A GOOD ONE IS A BETTER ONE
THEN SAID UNLESS I GREATLY ERR THIS PRIVATE WISHES TO PREFER A SMALL PETITION TO YOU SIR AND SO AGAIN SALUTED
THE SEARCH THROUGH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA FOR JASPER WAS PROTRACTED
THE OTHER DAY WE HEARD THE CUCKOO IN HAMPSHIRE
SHE WAS RIGHT
TOWARDS THE EAST AND NORTH AS I POINTED OUT TO CELIA THUS BEING PLEASANTLY COOL AT LUNCH-TIME
THE DOG'S COLLAR RIGHT WATSON
PROBABLY AFTER DARK THEY GET UP AND DO SOMETHING
IT WAS JASPER WHO STOLE THE COMPROMISING DOCUMENTS
ONE DAY HE WOULD HEAR FROM THE PUBLISHER TO WHOM HE HAD SENT HIS NOVEL A YEAR AGO
R FOR ROSE I SHOUTED
III
III
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT LIMPETS ONLY THAT THEY STICK LIKE BILLY-O I SUPPOSE MORE ABOUT THEM IS KNOWN THAN THAT I SUPPOSE SO
I WAS NOW A REAL SECOND LIEUTENANT
AEROPLANES REPLIED JACQUES RISSOLE AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
BY MULTIPLYING THE TWO NUMBERS TOGETHER AND PASSING THE HARD-BOILED EGG THROUGH THE SPONGE AND THEN TAKING THE
I STAYED BY HIM AND HELPED HIM COUNT UP TO EIGHT
IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE FOR YOU WELL THE CUP WAS BOUGHT ENGRAVED THE EMPIRE CHALLENGE CUP AND PLAYED FOR LAST MONDAY
A FEW GUESTS VII
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT
I FANCY SAID ONE OF THE GODS THAT IT MIGHT BE RATHER FUNNY IF MARIA JILTED THE CAPTAIN
AND THEN SUDDENLY QUITE CLOSE TO THE ALBERT MEMORIAL HE KNEW
WHAT IS THAT I ASKED POINTING TO A BLUE THING ON THE FLOOR
A GREAT BOOK
THERE WAS ONLY ONE ENGLISH BODY ON THE LOGGIA
IN HIS PRESENT SHAPE HE IS PERHAPS NOT QUITE--NOT QUITE--WELL HOW SHALL I PUT IT NOT QUITE SUGGESTED AMARIL
OTHERWISE THEY SHAN'T HAVE IT WE DID WHAT WE COULD FOR HER
BLAKE PRODUCED THE BOOK NERVOUSLY
LADY LARKSPUR LOOKS AT HIM WITH AMAZEMENT
HE WOULD STUFF HIS POCKETS WITH THEM
WE HAD JUST COME BACK INTO THE LINE AFTER SIX DAYS IN RESERVE AND THE AFTERNOON BEING QUIET I WAS WRITING MY DAILY LETTER TO CELIA
LET'S BUY A LITTLE CUP AND PLAY FOR IT
YOU ARE RUN DOWN I SAID
NOW THANK HEAVEN WE CAN BEGIN A BURST OF LAUGHTER FROM CAPTAIN BOLSOVER ATTRACTED GENERAL ATTENTION AND EVERYBODY TURNED IN HIS DIRECTION
UNDOUBTEDLY YOUR MAJESTY VERY GOOD OF HIM I'M SURE HUMPH SAID FREDERICK AGAIN
WHAT DID YOU SAY IT WAS I HOPED THAT THE AUTHORITY WOULD SPEAK FIRST AND THAT THE OTHERS WOULD THEN ACCEPT MY ASSURANCE THAT THEY HAD MISUNDERSTOOD ME THE DAY BEFORE
DIDN'T YOU SAY LOBSTER I SAID ICE OH I SAID OH I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
AND APOLOGIZING PRETTILY INSIDE IN CASE I AM BY NOW A COLONEL
AND FRIENDS I MURMURED WHAT'S THE ODDS IF YOU ARE RATHER BATTERED GODS
BARLOW
OVER WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS AND ACROSS SHELL HOLES DASHED PRIVATE SMITHLORD FIRING RAPIDLY WITH HIS REVOLVER ALL THE WHILE
AND SO ON DOWN TO THAT MAGNIFICENT LAST VERSE
YOURS FAITHFULLY JNO
YOURS FAITHFULLY JNO
SOMETHING--WAS IT THE DUCHESS'S CHAMPAGNE AT DINNER?--HAD REMINDED HIM OF THE ACID-DROP THEY HAD EATEN TOGETHER AND THIS HAD BROUGHT BACK HIS MEMORIES IN A FLOOD
THERE WAS A HINT AT THE BACK OF A CLEAN-CUT LAWN
NOW MY DEAR LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS
A.A
A ROARING LION IS A CALAMITY TO ITS FATHER BUT THE CAUTIOUS MAN COMETH NOT AGAIN THAT SORT OF THING WE MIGHT TRY IT SAID CELIA DOUBTFULLY NOT FEELING QUITE SURE IF IT WERE A REAL PROVERB
YOU ARE A HERRING SHE SAID SADLY
ON REFERRING TO MY ENCYCLOPEDIA I SEE THAT ACCORDING TO SOME AUTHORITIES GOD SAVE THE KING IS WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED TO DR BULL
LET US IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO SECURE AN INVITATION TO ONE OF LADY POLDOODLE'S POETRY AT-HOMES AT HER CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE IN BERKELEY SQUARE
WE HAVE SEVEN CLOCKS ALREADY SAID CELIA
I DIDN'T WAIT SAMUEL YOU ARE QUITE WELL INSIDE AREN'T YOU QUITE MYRA
SUCH DISTRESSING INCIDENTS MUST OFTEN HAVE OCCURRED WITHIN YOUR MAJESTY'S RECOLLECTION THEY HAVE YES
I WASN'T GOING TO STAND THAT
FOR MY NEXT TRICK WHICH I CALL THE ILLUSORY EGG AND WHICH IS MOST COMPLICATED YOU REQUIRE A SPONGE TWO TABLECLOTHS A HANDFUL OF NUTS A RABBIT FIVE YARDS OF COLOURED RIBBON A TOP-HAT WITH A HOLE IN IT A HARD-BOILED EGG TWO FLORINS AND A GENTLEMAN'S WATCH
YOU UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED THE OTHER
I HELD UP A DELAYING HAND
SORRY BUT IT'S A SPADE IN THE ONLY PRISON FILM WE'VE GOT HASTILY BORROWING A SPADE FROM A COMRADE WHO WAS DIGGING POTATOES HE STRUCK SEVERAL OF HIS GAOLERS DOWN AND DODGING THE SHOTS OF OTHERS WHO HURRIED TO THE SCENE HE CLIMBED THE PRISON WALL AND DASHED FOR FREEDOM
LET'S DO IT FOR OUR FIRST GAMBLE ANYWAY
BLANKTOWN MIGHT DISAPPEAR IN THE NIGHT OR THE INHABITANTS MIGHT GIVE UP USING ELECTRIC LIGHT IT SEEMED SAFE ENOUGH
AT FIFTEEN-STONE-ELEVEN THE BREAKFAST GONG WENT
THEY'RE SO DULL NOT WHEN YOU GET A GRAND SLAM SAID OUR HOST THINKING OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE
NO NOT NOW I SAID AS SHE HELD OUT HER HAND EAGERLY
ALL RIGHT WE'LL SAY THE SIXTEENTH
GUESS WHAT I'VE GOT HE SAID EAGERLY
YOU SEE I THOUGHT MYRA YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME RECORDS OF THE PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO JOLLY TO LOOK BACK ON AND--ER I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW YOU WORK IT BUT I EXPECT SOME OF YOU KNOW AND--ER COME ON SAID MYRA I'LL SHOW YOU SHE RETIRED WITH SIMPSON TO A SECLUDED PART OF THE LOGGIA AND HELPED HIM PUT THE FILMS IN
I MADE AN EFFORT THEREFORE WITH THE SEVENTH PERSON
THANK YOU LADY POLDOODLE FOR SUCH A DELIGHTFUL AFTERNOON THE PERILS OF REVIEWING A MOST UNFORTUNATE THING HAS HAPPENED TO A FRIEND OF MINE CALLED
YOU HAVE BINGO NOW DEFINITELY A PEKINESE
THEN SWUNG HERSELF OUT OF THE HAMMOCK AND WENT IN FOR HER HAT
IT HAD GOT TIRED OF WAITING AND HAD HIDDEN ITSELF
NOW IT COMES ON THE SCENE IN ANOTHER GUISE
HAS A YEAR OF MARRIAGE SO GREATLY CHANGED ME
THE EMPIRE IS AT STAKE
I CAN'T BEAR THIS LIFE ANY LONGER
FOUR YEARS IN THE ARMY HAS ABSOLUTELY SPOILT THE MARKET
IN ONE MOMENT BINGO HAD LOST BOTH HIS GREAT-GRANDFATHER AND HIS GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER
WHY SHOULD THEY THINK THAT EVERYTHING THEY SAY TO US IS FUNNY OR CLEVER OR IMPORTANT
IT IS THE OFFICER WHOM HE RESCUED
AT THE FIFTH HOLE A FALLS OFF THE TEE INTO A POND I FORGET HOW IT WENT ON
LADY POLDOODLE STILL MECHANICALLY CLAPPING SAYS TO HER NEIGHBOUR
PARTLY BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS TRUSTWORTHY PARTLY BECAUSE I SPENT THE REST OF MY LEAVE IN BED WITH A SEVERE COLD
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE ORDINARY SORT DON'T FORGET IT
WE MUST WAIT UNTIL WE GET MORE PRACTISED AT LETTER-WRITING
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE KING
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO DOUBT THAT HIS CONSCIENCE WAS TOO SENSITIVE
HE LONGED TO SAY SO DO I BUT WAS AFRAID THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD ENGLISH
NOW SAYS JENNY EAGERLY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A DARLING LITTLE CRAB
CELIA WHO HAD NEARLY FINISHED BREAKFAST LOOKED UP EAGERLY AS I CAME IN
INDEED I AM EVEN RATHER PROUD OF IT
CONTRARIWISE THE FATHER'S ONE AND ONLY TREASURE WAS HIS SON YES EVEN WHEN HE'D GONE AND DONE THINGS WHICH ANNOYED HIM RATHER
DAHLIA HOW'S PETER AND WILL YOU HAVE SOME COFFEE PETER'S LOVELY
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL HE PATTED THE TOP OF HER HEAD AND DISMISSED HER
HOWEVER WE CAN ALWAYS SAY WE SAW IT I REASSURED MYRA
HOWEVER I MUST DO MY BEST
OUR FEATHERED SONGSTER IN THE PLANE-TREE BROKE INTO HIS LITTLE PIECE
WHERE O BINGO IS THAT DELICATE FEATHER CURLING GRACEFULLY OVER THE BACK WHICH WAS THE PRIDE AND GLORY OF THY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
IN SHORT THE OUTLOOK HERE IS DISTINCTLY HOPEFUL
II ON THE MORNING AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE ELEVEN PODBYS AS THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO CALL THEMSELVES JOHN SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT SPOKE QUITE FRANKLY TO ALGERNON THE ELDEST
I SHOULD LIKE TO PAUSE HERE AND DESCRIBE MY COSTUME TO YOU WHICH WAS A QUIET GREY IN THE BEST OF TASTE BUT MYRA SAYS THAT IF I DO THIS I MUST DESCRIBE HERS TOO A FEAT BEYOND ME
AND THEN WITH TRUTH SOMETIMES I--I DON'T
A CYNIC IS A MAN WHO ETC
A CYNIC IS A MAN WHO ETC
A CYNIC IS A MAN WHO ETC
I THOUGHT YOU ALWAYS BEGAN MY LORD MAYOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SHE SAID
CELIA I SAID THIS IS WONDERFUL IT REALLY WAS WONDERFUL
I WOULD GET UP EARLY AND PICK THE MUSHROOMS FOR BREAKFAST
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EXPLAINED WHY YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO MUST HAVE SEEN YOUR NAME ON HUNDREDS OF POSTERS THOUGHT YOUR INITIALS WERE E.M.W ANDREW EXPLAINED
FATHER THOUGHT HE WASN'T BUT MOTHER WASN'T QUITE SO SURE
THAT DECIDED ME
THEN TAKING THE PACK OF CARDS IN YOUR OWN HANDS YOU OFFER IT TO A THIRD MEMBER OF THE PARTY REQUESTING HIM TO SELECT A CARD AND EXAMINE IT CAREFULLY
IT'S FOUR-THIRTY NOW
AT ANY RATE YOU WILL HEAR HIM NOW MR SYDNEY WORPLE TALL AND THIN WEARING THE SORT OF TIE WHICH MAKES YOU THINK YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE STEPS FORWARD AMIDST APPLAUSE
BUT NOT SUCH AN AIR AS WAS GIVEN BY HIS OTHER TREASURE--THE PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY
IN A MOMENT HE REAPPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE MILL WITH HYACINTH UNDER HIS ARM
A HIGH VOICE OFFERED CONTINUOUS APOLOGIES--AND SIMPSON CAME IN
MIND YOU COME SHE GOT HER FACE STRAIGHT AGAIN WITH A JERK AND TURNED TO THE SOLEMN OLD GENTLEMAN ON HER OTHER SIDE
LEFT ALONE THE MAJOR GAVE VENT TO HIS RAGE
MY THOUGHTS ARE EVER WITH THE STOMACH THAT I LEAVE BEHIND
THE YOUNG ONE'S LAWS WERE WISELY MADE TILL SOMEONE TOOK A HAND-GRENADE AND THREW IT SHOUTING DOWN WITH KINGS THE OLD ONE LAID FOUNDATION STONES AND THINGS
I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE RESULT OF THREE YEARS WORK
BUT ALL THE TADPOLES IN THE POND ARE DUMB--HOWEVER FOND
STOPES STOPES
AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE ROOMS OF SUCH A LARGE AND OBVIOUSLY DISTINGUISHED PARTY THERE WOULD BE A SLIGHT SENSATION AMONG THE CROWD AND WAY WOULD BE MADE FOR US AT THE MOST IMPORTANT TABLE
THUS HAPPENED IT THAT MRS PHIPP AND I HAD NEVER MET TO ANY GREAT EXTENT HAD NEVER MET AS FAR AS I REMEMBERED AT ALL
HE REALIZED SUDDENLY THAT HE WAS IN LOVE
ANOTHER MILE ALONG A LANE AND THEN WE BOTH STOPPED TOGETHER
HOW DID HE MANAGE IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE COMPANY WAS PUZZLED
AN ULTIMATUM HAD BEEN SENT TO RURITANIA DEMANDING AN APOLOGY AN INDEMNITY OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND MARKS AND THE PUBLIC DEGRADATION OF CAPTAIN TOMSK WHOSE EPAULETTES WERE TO BE TORN OFF BY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE ESSENLAND ARMY IN THE PRESENCE OF A FULL CORPS OF CINEMATOGRAPH ARTISTS
OFTEN HE HAD GONE INTO THE BRITISH MUSEUM AND LEANT AGAINST A MUMMY-CASE OR TAKEN A BUS TO CHELSEA AND PRESSED HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE BRASS-PLATE WHICH MARKED CARLYLE'S HOUSE BUT NO INSPIRATION HAD COME
SMITHLORD SALUTED AND BEGGED THE NURSE TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
II THE PATIENT IN THE XTH BED AT THE YTH BASE HOSPITAL STIRRED RESTLESSLY
A CRY RENDS THE AIR SUDDENLY WHISTLES ARE BLOWING THERE IS A RATTLING OF HORSES HOOFS
AND WITH ONE FOOT ON THE BOTTOM STEP OF THE DUGOUT I WAITED ANXIOUSLY
WILL YOU PROMISE SAID CELIA THAT WE SHALL HAVE LUNCH IN THERE ONE DAY I PROMISE I SAID READILY
MON AMI_--ER--_REVIENDRA HE IS VERY HOT
NOW THERE WAS ONE LITTLE BLACK PIG FOR WHOM HI-YOU HAD A SPECIAL TENDERNESS
HIS MARVELLOUS PERFORMANCE ON THE SWINGING HORIZONTAL BAR WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
I THINK I HAVE MORE CLAIM TO A HORSE CALLED TOBY THAN HAS A CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR FEATHERED FRIENDS OR WHATEVER PAPER THE SNIPING OFFICER WRITES FOR
IT WAS NO GOOD
HE IS DEEP IN HIS BOOK AND LOOKS AS IF HE WERE SETTLED IN HIS CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE FOR THE DAY
SIMPSON GOT A GOOD ONE OFF MY FACE EXPLAINED THOMAS
THE CIGARETTE OF COURSE WILL BE SMOKED AT OTHER MOMENTS THAN EPIGRAMMATIC ONES BUT ON THESE OTHER OCCASIONS YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DEAL SO FULLY WITH IT IN THE STAGE DIRECTIONS
THE FACT IS MY DEAR HE SAID IN ANSWER TO A QUESTION FROM THE COUNTESS I AM A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT ALGERNON
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO END TO HIS NOVEL AS HE HAD PLANNED IT
MY DEAR THAT'S JUST THE THING AND I POINTED WITH MY STICK
WE HAD NOT MANY DAYS LEFT
GIVE ME THE POLAR BEARS I ALWAYS SAY AND YOU CAN KEEP THE SEALS AND THE WALRUSES AND THE PENGUINS
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
AT FOUR-STONE-SIX I SAID THAT I HAD BETTER HAVE AN EGG OR TWO AS WELL
BECAUSE HIS WINGS WERE CLIPPED SO SMALL THE TAME ONE DID NOT FLY AT ALL BUT SANG TO HEAVEN ALL THE DAY THE OTHER SHORTLY AFTER FLEW AWAY
IT WAS NOT AN IMPOSING ROOM TO LOOK AT
IT WAS AT THE CRITICAL WORD OF THE JOKE
HE WANTED TO SAY THAT HE WAS JOHN BUT COULD NOT
I NEVER KNOW
I SEE WHAT HE MEANS
BUT THE NURSE ASSURES US THAT IT IS OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR MURGATROYD
NO SAID HERBERT
I COULD ORDER CARS SPOSA OR--OR SPAGHETTI OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT A TREMOR BUT OF COURSE YOU SHALL PUT JUST WHATEVER YOU LIKE
PROMOTION IN OUR REGIMENT WAS DIFFICULT
LIME JUICE OR--OR LIME JUICE I'LL HAVE LIME JUICE THANK YOU SAID THE GENERAL AFTER CONSIDERATION
IT'S THE SARDINE SEASON NOW IT WAS AT CANNES THAT WE SAW THE FIRST ORANGES
HE LETS GO OF JENNY'S HAND AND TROTS UP TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHITE WHISKERS
OH THAT'S BEEN DONE HE SAID
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING SO TACTLESS
FAILING THIS WAR WOULD BE DECLARED
TRY IT FOR YOURSELF
YOUR FRIENDS CANNOT SAVE YOU NOW
IT WAS THE DUTY OF HI-YOU TO BRING UP ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-ONE PIGS FOR HIS MASTER AND THIS HE DID WITH AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AS THE WORK PERMITTED
NATURALLY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WOULD WISH TO RETAIN HIS SUITE HUMPH SAID FREDERICK MEANING I IMAGINE THAT THINGS WERE LOOKING UP
AFTERWARDS WHEN HE HAS GOT THE KNACK HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO JUSTICE TO THE SCENERY ARCHIE JOINED US AGAIN FOLLOWED BY THE BULL-DOG
I DECIDE TO RISK IT
IF YOU HAD BEEN EIGHTEEN THE MAN SAID OR--OR NINE IT WOULD HAVE COME MUCH CHEAPER
SMITH PROVED TO BE JUST THE BEST GOLFER I HAD EVER MET BEING WHEN AT THE TOP OF HIS FORM ALMOST EXACTLY AS GOOD AS I WAS
HE HAS TO LIVE IN LONDON NOW BUT HIS HEART IS IN PARIS
I EXPLAIN THAT I WAS ALWAYS DELICATELY SLENDER BUT THAT LATTERLY MY RIBS HAVE BEEN OVERDOING IT
THE LESSER BUNTING SAID AN EARNEST-LOOKING GIRL
THE NEXT MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A STRANGER ASKING FOR SOME SIMPLE INFORMATION WHICH I COULD HAVE GIVEN HIM ON A POST-CARD
ANY ANYTHING
RICHARD HE CRIED ESCAPED AGAIN NOW JASPER I HAVE YOU WITH A TRIUMPHANT CRY THEY RUSHED AT EACH OTHER
NO NO
THEY CONSIST CHIEFLY OF TWO HOURS BOWLING TO THE BATTING OF DICK WHO HITS THEM BACK VERY HARD AND TEN MINUTES BATTING TO THE BOWLING OF PHYLLIS SLOW MILD AND BOBBY FAST WIDES
AT TIMES THEY CAME CLOSE TOGETHER
DAHLIA AND MYRA GOT UP SLOWLY AND ARCHIE AND I FILLED OUR PIPES AND FOLLOWED THEM OUT
I WAS SO SURPRISED BY IT THAT I ADDED IN BRACKETS THIS IS QUITE MY OWN
O NORTHCLIFFE LORD
THEN WE BEGAN TO LOOK HIM UP IN THE MAP
AND WHAT OF MAJOR MURGATROYD
HALLO THEY'VE PUT THE WRONG INITIALS ON IT
JENNY HAS EVIDENTLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CRAB FOR THIS AFTERNOON
HYACINTH
OUR NEXT POET HE SAYS IS MISS MIRANDA HERRICK WHOSE WORK IS SO DISTINGUISHED FOR ITS--ER--ITS--ER--DISTINCTION MISS HERRICK DRESSED IN PALE GREEN AND WEARING PINCENEZ FLUTTERS IN GIRLISHLY
AS HE WAS PROCEEDING ALONG THE TOP OF A LONELY CLIFF HE WAS CONFRONTED SUDDENLY BY THE ENEMY WHOM HE HAD THOUGHT TO KILL
BUT HOWEVER IT BE WHEN THEY DO COME I MEAN TO BE READY FOR THEM STILL THOUGH OUR SLUG-TRAP WILL NO DOUBT COME IN USEFULLY IT IS NOT WHAT WE REALLY WANT
AND ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HE HAD FIRST SET FOOT IN THE MOTHER CITY LONDON SMITH AND I MET AT MY CLUB FOR LUNCH
AND WHO IS IT IN THE NEXT BED
THE WATCH FROM WHICH YOU EXTRACT THE WORKS IS NOT THE BORROWED ONE BUT ONE WHICH YOU HAVE HAD CONCEALED BETWEEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND
FOR YEARS ESSENLAND HAS WRITHED UNDER THE PROVOCATIONS OF RURITANIA BUT HAS PRESERVED A DIGNIFIED SILENCE
WE OFFERED THE MONEY TO ARCHDEACONS AND OTHER MEN OF PRONOUNCED PROBITY
BUT ALL THIS HAD HAPPENED TEN YEARS AGO
I SHOW PEOPLE ROUND OUR LITTLE PLACE AND I POINT OUT HOPEFULLY THE HOT TAP DOULTONII IN THE SCULLERY AND THE DOROTHY PERKINS DOORMAT BUT IT ISN'T THE SAME THING AS TAKING YOUR GUEST ROUND YOUR GARDEN AND TELLING HIM THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS RAIN
THREE OF ICE BILL SAID THE FISHMONGER AND BILL GAVE ME QUITE A RESPECTABLE SEGMENT IN THE MORNING POST AND I WANT A TAXI I SAID AND I WAVED MY LOBSTER AT ONE
I SEE ALREADY THE FIRST BALL TWISTING OVER THE GREEN AS I TAKE MY STAND I HEAR ALREADY LONG-ON INSISTING IT WASN'T A CHANCE THAT CAME TO HAND OR NO
THAT IS ALL
BUT A TRUE MUSICIAN HAS I TAKE IT A HIGHER AIM
WE WERE STANDING AT THE TOP OF FLAMBOROUGH HEAD LOOKING DOWN INTO THE SEA WHEN HE PAUSED AND TAPPED HIS GLASS SHERRY JENKINS HE SAID CATCHING THE BUTLER'S EYE
THERE'S NO RULE WHICH INSISTS THAT YOU SHALL HIT THE BALL OR EVEN THAT YOU SHALL HIT NEAR THE BALL OR EVEN THAT YOU SHALL SEE THE BALL WHEN YOU HIT AT IT
AND I WANT MY PIPE ANYHOW
YOURS VERY TRULY ERNEST M
THIS BEING DONE YOU COVER EACH HEAP WITH A TABLECLOTH SO THAT NONE OF THE OBJECTS BENEATH IS IN ANY WAY VISIBLE
AND EVERY ONE OF THE NOVELS WOULD ESTABLISH THE AUTHOR'S RIGHT TO BE RECKONED ETC AND PLACE HIM UNDOUBTEDLY IN THE VERY FRONT RANK
AND THEN GOING THROUGH THE CARDS ONE BY ONE YOU WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING THE FIVE OF SPADES WHICH YOU WILL HOLD UP TO THE COMPANY WITH THE WORDS I THINK THIS IS YOUR CARD SIR"--WHEREUPON THE AUDIENCE WILL TESTIFY BY ITS SURPRISE AND APPRECIATION THAT YOU HAVE GUESSED CORRECTLY
AT LAST CRIED JASPER AND KNOCKING RICHARD HEAVILY ON THE HEAD WITH A BOOT HE PICKED UP HIS UNCONSCIOUS ENEMY AND CARRIED HIM TO A TRIBUTARY OF THE AMAZON NOTED FOR ITS ALLIGATORS
FURNISHED SIMPLY BUT TASTEFULLY WITH A TABLE OFFICERS FOR USE OF ONE AND A CHAIR DITTO ONE IT GAVE LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE DISTRESSING SCENES WHICH HAD BEEN ENACTED IN IT AND STILL LESS EVIDENCE OF THE TERRIBLE SCENE WHICH WAS TO COME
I--ER--WANT I FUMBLED IN MY TICKET-POCKET I WANT I LOVE YOU ON IT AND I WENT THROUGH THE WAISTCOAT POCKETS A THIRD TIME
THE BIRD SAID IT AGAIN
6D LORD BLIGHT LOOKED UP WITH AN IMPATIENT EJACULATION GIVE IT TO ME HE SAID IN SOME ANNOYANCE SNATCHING IT AWAY FROM HER AND THROWING IT INTO THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET
BUT WORLDLY POSSESSIONS ARE NOT EVERYTHING
READ IT
IF YOURS IS AN 8.15 PLAY YOU MAY BE SURE THAT THE STALLS WILL NOT FILL UP TILL 8.30 AND YOU SHOULD THEREFORE LET LOOSE THE LESSER-PAID MEMBERS OF THE CAST ON THE OPENING SCENE KEEPING YOUR FIFTY-POUNDERS IN RESERVE
WHAT THE CRITIC WANTS TO KNOW IS WHY LORD ARTHUR CHOSE THAT VERY MOMENT TO COME IN--THE VERY MOMENT WHEN LADY LARKSPUR WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE OAK-BEAMED HALL OF LARKSPUR TOWERS
A SHAW WITH WHOM THE COMMON MAN AGREES
BUT ONLY TO CRACK AT THE NEXT AND LEAVE ME AT THE EDGE OF THE GREEN TO PLAY ONE OFF ELEVEN IT WAS IN FACT A DING-DONG STRUGGLE ALL THE WAY
RATS FIDO FETCH EM--IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND--_DOWN SIR!--ARROWS--PUT IT DOWN
AND WHEN TO CLINCH MATTERS THE DRAMATIST MAKES MR GERALD DU MAURIER LIGHT A REAL CIGARETTE IN THE THIRD ACT THEN HE CAN FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE HAS INDEED ACHIEVED THE AMBITION OF EVERY STAGE WRITER AND BROUGHT THE ACTUAL SCENT OF THE HAY ACROSS THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT THERE IS A TECHNIQUE TO BE ACQUIRED IN THIS MATTER AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE WITHIN THE THEATRE
IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A CLUE TO LAFORGUE'S MANNER ANY MORE THAN MUST I SIT HERE MOTHER YES WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU MUST TELLS YOU ALL THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MEREDITH
WHATEVER ELSE IS TRUE OF CANADA THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IT TURNS OUT DELIGHTFUL GOLFERS
SUMMER DAYS A SONG FOR THE SUMMER IS IT RAINING
JUST WAIT A MOMENT I SAID TO HER RATHER ANXIOUSLY AND PICKED UP THE TELEPHONE BOOK
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS
YOU MUST PUT IT DOWN TO THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER MIND A DIM SENSE OF FOREBODING WHICH KEPT CASTING ITS SHADOW ACROSS HER PLEASANTER THOUGHTS
IT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED THAT IN MR MOTT WE HAVE A REAL POET
I CANNOT LET HIM SUFFER ANY LONGER
WHAT DID THAT ONE MEAN FATHER ASKED AMARIL
THEN WE WAVED FAREWELL TO OUR FAMILY AND WENT ON
HOW IS IT THAT THE BOY COMES TO HAVE THIS UNMANLY WEAKNESS IT SEEMS HE HAS ALWAYS HAD IT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN HAND
WORKING UP GRADUALLY TO THE SUBJECT OF RATS AND EVEN MORE GRADUALLY INTERTWINING IT SO TO SPEAK WITH THE SUBJECT OF CATS I BROUGHT OFF IN ONE PERFECT CLIMAX THE GREAT JOKE
1 MR S
YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL ME SAID HIS MAJESTY POINTING TO THE PIG THAT THIS IS PRINCE FREDERICK IT IS INDEED SIRE
SOME ENCHANTER--IT WAS A COMMON ENOUGH HAPPENING IN THOSE DAYS--ANNOYED BY FREDERICK'S FATHER OR HIS UNCLE OR EVEN BY FREDERICK HIMSELF HAD TURNED HIM INTO A SMALL BLACK PIG UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE FEELING BETWEEN THEM HAD PASSED AWAY
HE WILL ALSO INSTRUCT ME HOW TO BRING SERPENTS TO THE GROUND WITH THE IDEA OF CLEANSING THE SKY OF CAULIFLOWERS SAID GASPARD I SHALL PROCEED TO THE FLYING-GROUND AT DORMANCOURT
LIFE IS VERY DIFFICULT ON THE MORNINGS WHEN YOU ARE IN A HURRY
SO I CUT THEM OUT SENT THE LAST SWALLOW
I DOUBT IT I DOUBT IT I SAID THOUGHTFULLY
YOU'RE JUST LIKE NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD WELL OF COURSE YOU HAD TO SAY THAT NO I HADN'T
THERE WERE HOURS WHEN HE WOULD REST AWHILE AND AMUSE HIMSELF BY WATCHING THE ANTICS OF THE COMMON MOSQUITO MANAGER
SHOULD YOU EVER DO US THE HONOUR OF DINING WITH US AS I HOPE YOU WILL AND WHICH SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE SHOULD THERE EVER COME A MOMENT WHEN THE CONVERSATION RUNS LOW AND YOU ARE REVOLVING IN YOUR MIND WHETHER IT IS WORTH WHILE ASKING US IF WE HAVE BEEN TO ANY THEATRES LATELY THEN I SHALL PRODUCE THE ALBUM AND YOU WILL BE LEFT IN NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE JUST BACK FROM THE RIVIERA
CARRIED AWAY BY HIS PASSION FOR HER HE MANAGER
DESTINY AS THE POETS HAVE OBSERVED OR WILL DO SHORTLY IS A MIGHTY THING
AS SOON AS THE LIGHTS GO DOWN AND WHILE THE BALD STOUT GENTLEMAN IS KICKING OUR TOP-HAT OUT OF HIS WAY TREADING HEAVILY ON OUR TOES AND WHEEZING SORRY SORRY AS HE STRUGGLES TO HIS SEAT A BUZZ BEGINS BEHIND THE CURTAIN
THEN THE CURTAIN RISES AND IT IS APPARENT THAT WE ARE ASSISTING AT AN AT HOME OF CONSIDERABLE SPLENDOUR
I FOR ISABEL--ISABEL IS THE NAME OF THE SISTER
I HAD EIGHT STONE AND A HALF ON THE WEIGHT PART AND THE-LITTLE-THING-YOU-MOVE-UP-AND-DOWN WAS ON THE 4 NOTCH AND THE BAR BALANCED MIDWAY BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM
BUT YOU SHALL TELL ME I WILL TELL YOU I SAID FAINTLY
THAT IF IT WAS RAINING HARD AT NIGHT IT WOULD BE BEASTLY
THE OBVIOUS ANSWER THAT THE FIRM WHICH IS MENTIONED IN THE PROGRAMME AS SUPPLYING HIS TROUSERS WOULD BE ANNOYED IF HE DIDN'T IS NOT ENOUGH
DAWN AFTER WEARY DAWN I START THE NEVER-ENDING ROUND OF PENANCE
AFTER ALL WHEN YOUR PROFESSION IS WRITING YOU HAVE SOME EXCUSE FOR DEMANDING A CHANGE OF OCCUPATION IN YOUR LEISURE HOURS
CELIA I WANT ANOTHER WORD FOR E
READ IT CAREFULLY AND THEN HAVE AN UPROARIOUS TIME IN YOUR OWN LITTLE HOUSE IT WAS A MERRY PARTY ASSEMBLED AT HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL FOR CHRISTMAS
IF THERE ARE ANY LIMPETS IN MARS THEY ARE FRESHWATER ONES
UNLESS THAT DOCUMENT IS RECOVERED THE FAIR NAME OF THE REGIMENT WILL BE IRRETRIEVABLY TARNISHED NEVER CRIED A CORPORAL OF THE SIGNALLING SECTION AND THERE WAS A DEEP MURMUR OF APPLAUSE
BUT BLOOD WILL TELL
SUPPOSE I SAID TO A FELLOW OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY I WANT SOME OF THAT GREEN STUFF IN THE WINDOW HE WOULD ONLY LAUGH
HOWEVER PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO KEEP IN WITH JENNY AND NOT TO LET HER SEE THAT HE IS DISAPPOINTED SO EVERY TIME SHE SAYS ISN'T THE SEA LOVELY HE ECHOES LOVELY AND NOW AND THEN HE ADDS JUST TO HUMOUR HER IS AT THE SEA AND THEN SHE HAS THE CHANCE TO SAY AGAIN YES THAT'S THE SEA DARLING
ONLY TEN LITTLE DAYS IN WHICH TO DO SO MUCH
REALLY YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE READ YOUR WEDDING-RING AT ALL
THIS WAS THE LETTER
IN AN INSTANT HE HAD PLUNGED IN AND RESCUED THEM
COMMON HE LOOKED AND COMMON HE WAS CALLED WITH A CHRISTIAN NAME OF HOWARD FOR REGISTRATION
WHAT MAKES LIGHTNING SHE IS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN TO SAY OH THE THUNDER THEN YOU TELL HER THAT THE TWO NUMBERS MULTIPLIED TOGETHER COME TO 170
A CLEVER CONJURER IS WELCOME ANYWHERE AND THOSE OF US WHOSE POWERS OF ENTERTAINMENT ARE LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF BOOBY-TRAPS OR THE ARRANGING OF APPLE-PIE BEDS MUST VIEW WITH ENVY THE MUCH GREATER TRIBUTE OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE WHICH IS THE LOT OF THE PRESTIDIGITATOR WITH SOME NATURAL GIFT FOR LEGERDEMAIN
MY REPUTATION AS A MAN AS A WRITER AS A CRITIC DEPENDED ON IT
HOW SHALL THIS SUCCESS BE ACHIEVED
I LOOKED AT THE PIANOLA AND THEN I SAID TO CELIA I MUST PLAY IT ONCE AGAIN PLEASE SAID CELIA
NO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TO GET RID OF IT WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE
A PORTER APPEARS AT THE OPEN WINDOW AND SPEAKS VOLUBLE FRENCH TO SIMPSON
THERE'S NOTHING TO PREVENT MY CALLING IT MORE THAN IT REALLY IS
IT WOULD BE A GREAT MOMENT BUT I DO NOT THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT YET
BY THE WAY I'VE GOT TO GO OUT NOW
BUT I DOUBT IF IT IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC PASSAGES
OR PERHAPS YOU DON'T
RICHARD MY BOY WHEN THE HOME SECRETARY KNOWS EVERYTHING HE WILL GIVE YOU A FREE PARDON
WE CAN SACK HIM AND PROMOTE THOMAS BUT THE MISCHIEF IS DONE
THAT REMINDS ME OF AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE WHICH OCCURRED TO MY HOUSEKEEPER LAST FRIDAY
II NOW IT CHANCED THAT ONE MORNING WHEN FREDERICK AND HI-YOU WERE ARGUING TOGETHER IN A FRIENDLY MANNER OVER THE NEW UNIFORMS OF THE TOWN GUARD TO THE COLOURS OF WHICH FREDERICK TOOK EXCEPTION KING CARRAWAY HIMSELF PASSED THAT WAY AND BEING IN A GOOD HUMOUR STOOD FOR A MOMENT LISTENING TO THEM
THE COLONEL TOOK HIM BY THE HAIR AND FURTIVELY CONVEYED HIM WHERE THE GENERAL INHALED THE AIR IMMACULATELY BOOTED
HE WANTS NOT A CASUAL INTRODUCTION BUT A PRESENTATION
SAMUEL CRIED MYRA
A HUNDRED AND FOUR SAID COMMON
WELL NOW THEY KNOW
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO HEAR A CHARGE OF THE UHLANS--BEASTS
ONE DAY WE SHALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER WITH AWE IN OUR FACES AND SAY BUT IT'S STILL FLIPPERTING AND FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THE HILL OF CAMPDEN WILL BE A PLACE HOLY AND ENCHANTED
I SAY NOTHING OF MY HUSBAND GO ON SMILED MYRA
YOU MUSTN'T BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE WHEN THE ACTUAL MOMENT COMES BUT YOU'RE A LIEUTENANT NOW SHE SAID IF THAT'S TRUE
ALMOST EXACTLY BENEATH US IF ANYTHING FELL UPON HIM FROM HERE SAID THE EARL THOUGHTFULLY IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT SUDDENLY THE FASCINATION WHEREOF HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER CAME IRRESISTIBLY HOME TO THE COUNTESS
FOR BY THIS TIME WHAT WITH HERBERT'S SUBALTERN CAREY'S PAWN AND A CISTERN LEFT ME BY AN UNCLE WHO WAS DINING WITH US THAT NIGHT I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME
AND I VENTURE TO PROPOSE THAT YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT A GREAT ALCHEMIST HAS BEEN COMPOUNDING A POTION TO RELIEVE THEIR BLINDNESS
LOVELY SAID CELIA EXCITEDLY
PRINCE FREDERICK OF MILVANIA--DEAR ME DEAR ME
IT WAS THE LAST STRAW WHICH BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK AND IT WAS HERBERT WHO STEPPED FORWARD BLITHELY WITH THE LAST STRAW
YOU WILL THEN SEE THAT I HAVE EXAGGERATED NEITHER MY HUSBAND'S APPETITE NOR THE LIGHT CONVERSATION OF MY BROTHER NOR THE POWER OF APOLOGY SHOULD ANY LITTLE CONTRETEMPS OCCUR OF MR SAMUEL SIMPSON
MY POOR BLIGHT
IT ENDS ON TUESDAY
NOW I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT CHESS BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF CHESS PROBLEMS
MISSED IT
SUMMON THE GUARD BLOW THE FIRE-ALARM SEND FOR THE ORDERLY SERGEANT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE THE ROOM WAS FULL OF ARMED MEN INCLUDING THE MAJOR
WHETHER TO BROWN OR BROWNIE MATTERED NOT HE DID NOT ANSWER DID NOT NOTICE THEM JUST STOOD AND BROODED
BUT YOU WHO READ THIS KNOW THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER

THEN I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU THE GOOD NEWS SAID CELIA
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION AT ALL ALGERNON WAS DELIGHTED AT THE IDEA AND REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD GIVE HIM GREATER PLEASURE THAN TO ACCOMPANY LORD BLIGHT
BUT WHAT FINALLY DECIDED HIM WAS A DISCOVERY OF MINE MADE ONLY YESTERDAY
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT BLACKMAN'S WARBLER WAS THE LOCAL NAME FOR THE CHIFF-CHAFF IN OUR PART OF SOMERSET WHEN THE AUTHORITY SPOKE AGAIN
THE RANGE OF A FIELD TELEPHONE IS SEVERAL MILES
ARE YOU READY

HE WAS ONLY SIX BUT EVEN THEN HE KNEW THAT NEVER WOULD HE SEE AGAIN ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL
LADY LARKSPUR STARTS SUDDENLY AND TURNS TOWARDS HIM LADY LARKSPUR
I LOVE YOU I--WELL LOOK HERE PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO BACK AND GET THE RING ON THE NEXT DAY I WAS THERE AGAIN
IT WAS NOT THE NAME PENQUARTO WHICH HAD TOLD HER
DEAR MRS CARDEW SHE SAID WE ARE READY FOR LUNCH WHEN YOU ARE
A FEW DAYS LATER MR BLANK WROTE TO SAY THAT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE HAD NEVER READ JE COMPRENDS TOUT IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ME VERY CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAD NEVER READ IT EITHER BUT I THOUGHT IT RATHER ODD OF HIM TO CONFESS AS MUCH TO A STRANGER
I'M LIKE--WHO WAS IT WHO SAW SOMETHING OF ANOTHER MAN'S AND WOULDN'T BE HAPPY TILL HE GOT IT THE BABY IN THE SOAP ADVERTISEMENT NO NO SOME KING IN HISTORY I BELIEVE YOU ARE THINKING OF AHAB BUT YOU AREN'T A BIT LIKE HIM REALLY
IS IT CHILLY
THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF T.Y.V.M
1 WE HAD BEEN TO THE RIVIERA
HE WILL GIVE UP MUSIC NOW FOR HE KNOWS I HAVE THE BULGE ON HIM
I S'POSE I THORT I DONE MY BIT
SAMUEL IT'S YOUR HONOUR THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE
THE OLD MASTERPIECE I SUPPOSE I SAID AS I GOT IT OUT
WELL SHE SAID
IT HAS BEEN I SAID
BY-AND-BY THE BATTALION ARRIVES AND EVERYBODY SURROUNDS YOU
SOMEBODY SAID CELIA WHO ISN'T SUPPLIED WITH MUSIC FROM BELOW I FOUND JOHN
E FOR ENNY I SHOUTED

EXCELLENT SAID MR BELLINGHAM AT DINNER THAT EVENING
I MUST HAVE--I ONLY HAD IT A--AH HERE IT IS
I MUST HAVE DINED WITH THE ANDREWS SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT NOTICING THE CIGAR-CASE BUT ON THIS OCCASION IT CAUGHT MY EYE AS WE WANDERED OUT TO JOIN THE LADIES AND I PICKED IT UP CARELESSLY
THAT IS NOT WHY I AM ANXIOUS
WHEN HE HAS DONE THIS HE PUTS IT BACK IN THE PACK AND YOU SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK HURRIEDLY AT THE FACE OF IT DISCOVERING LET US SAY THAT IT IS THE FIVE OF SPADES
I MUST HAVE PUT IT IN WRONG I SAID
SO THERE YOU ARE
WHITE MATES IN FOUR MOVES I LOOKED AT IT CARELESSLY
ROT
MY BLISS WAS EVERY BIT AS GREAT AS WHAT IT WAS IN 88 IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK SEDATE OR KEEP MY FEELINGS UNDER
ENTERING THE FIRST HOUSE LABELED OFFICERS 5 YOU SAY VOUS AVEZ UN LIT POUR UN OFFICIER ICI N'EST-CE PAS
IN REAL LIFE NO ONE THINKS ALOUD OR IN AN EMPTY ROOM
I'M TIRED OF IT
AT GREENWICH NO FATHEAD NOT AT GREENWICH
IT'S ALL RIGHT SHE'S DEAD REALLY_.]--AND SHE WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU
I DO NOT COMPLAIN
I FORGOT TO SAY THAT MY ACQUAINTANCE DREW ME A MAP HE PRODUCED A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET
MRS WHO SAID THE PORTER WHAT OR I CAN'T HEAR OR SOMETHING EQUALLY FOOLISH
LOTS OF HUSBANDS WOULD MERELY HAVE YAWNED I FELT ONE COMING AND STOPPED IT JUST IN TIME
SO ONE WOULD PLAY IT IF ONE WISHED TO ANNOY THE MAN IN THE FLAT BELOW
ER--DAHLIA COME ALONG--ER MONSIEUR ET MADAME MANNERING_--ER--MYRA LA SOEUR DE MONSIEUR_--ER--WHERE ARE YOU OLD CHAP?--_LE MARI DE LA SOEUR DE MONSIEUR ER--THOMAS--ER HE WAS CARRIED AWAY BY MEMORIES OF HIS SCHOOLBOY FRENCH LE FRERE DU JARDINIER_--ER HE WHEELED ROUND AND SAW ME
HE'D ONLY LOSE IT THEY'RE SOME VERY OLD FRIENDS WHO LIVE THERE AND THEY'RE GOING AWAY FOR A MONTH AND THE SERVANTS ARE STAYING ON AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT IF I WAS GOING ABROAD AGAIN THIS YEAR HOW DID THE SERVANTS KNOW YOU'D BEEN ABROAD LAST YEAR ASKED ARCHIE
OU EST COOKS'S HOMME HE CRIES
SETTLING DOWN THE VILLA WAS HIGH UP ON THE HILL HAVING AS SIMPSON WAS TO POINT OUT SEVERAL TIMES LATER MENTONE ON ITS LEFT HAND AND MONTE CARLO ON ITS RIGHT
EVERYBODY WAS SILENT EXCEPT THAT MISERABLE BIRD
IT IS SAD TO PART WITH AN OLD AND WELL-TRIED FRIEND PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT FRIEND IS ALMOST ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MARRIAGE
BUT NOW I'VE ONLY A MONTH--NO MERELY A COUPLE OF FORTNIGHTS LEFT TO WAIT
BEHOLD ME THEN COMPLETE
LIGHTS CIGARETTE NO EVEN THAT IS NOT GOOD
WHAT KEPT ME FROM THIS COURSE
ELEVEN SAID THE EARL GLOOMILY
AT THE SAME TIME YOU TELL THE OWNER OF THE WATCH THAT IF HE FEELS IN HIS POCKETS HE WILL FIND HIS PROPERTY RESTORED TO HIM INTACT
LUCKILY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE WANT
BUT I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE TO BRING THEM I SAID SEVERELY
AND THOUGH BETWEEN OURSELVES WE MIGHT REGARD IT AS A PROMISING FACE SPOILT FOR A TRADITION STILL DISCIPLINE WAS DISCIPLINE
FIVE FOUR SAID MISS PHIPPS
SAY YOU FORGIVE ME MY DEAR LORD SMITH LORD SMITH SHOOK HIS HAND WARMLY
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT IT'S A RAID ON THE BEGUM'S PALACE EXPLAINED ARCHIE RAPIDLY
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND WE'VE DONE THE BELGIANS PROUD I'M GOING TO KEEP A CHRYSALIS AND READ TO IT ALOUD
I'M JUST SITTING HERE SAYS HUMPHREY
YOU WILL SEE ORANGES AND LEMONS AND OLIVES AND CACTUSES AND PALMS
THE ONLY DIFFICULT WORD IS MEND WE MUSTN'T HAVE LESS THAN SEVEN WORDS ONE FOR EACH OF US CAN'T WE GET SOMETHING FROM SOLOMON FOR A CHANGE SAID PETER
SAY FIVE AT A GUINEA EACH THAT STILL LEAVES FIVE SHILLINGS IF ONLY IT LEFT THAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT
Y-YES SAID THE KING REGARDING FREDERICK WHO WAS COMBING HIMSELF THOUGHTFULLY BEHIND THE LEFT EAR WITH CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
AS ARRANGED FOR THE PIANOLA IT WAS MARKED TO BE PLAYED THROUGHOUT AT A LIGHTNING PACE AND WITH THE LOUDEST PEDAL ON
WE WILL SEND AN AGREEMENT ALONG TO-MORROW
SO THIS WAS LONDON
NOW THE COLONEL HAS ONLY ONE FAULT I HAVE BEEN DEFINITELY PROMISED MY SECOND STAR IN 1927 SO HE WON'T THINK I AM FLATTERING HIM WITH A PURPOSE
THIRTY-TWO I ASKED
I DON'T HAPPEN TO SEE RATS THERE AND IF I DON'T SEE THEM I CAN'T WRITE ABOUT THEM
AT HEADQUARTERS POSSIBLY
OR PERHAPS SHE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED WITH AN UGLY LITTLE GINGER DOG AND HE WOULD BE STORED IN SOME REPOSITORY BOARDED OUT IN SOME OLYMPIC KENNEL
BARELY A FORTNIGHT HAD ELAPSED BEFORE A FINAL PUSH DIVERTED THE LAST MEMBER OF THE FAMILY A VALUED UNCLE INTO THE EVER-CHANGING SEA THE VENUE IN THIS CASE BEING WHITBY PRESUMABLY IN ORDER TO AVOID SUSPICION
THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS AN ENORMOUS SILVER CIGAR-BOX NOT ENGRAVED WHICH BOUND ME TO HIM STILL MORE STRONGLY
THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE
I CAN BOWL BOBBY OUT SHE SAID MODESTLY
IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY"--AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
HE REPLIED IF IT TAKES SIX SECONDS FOR A CLOCK TO STRIKE SIX HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO STRIKE TWELVE I SAID TWELVE SECONDS BUT IT SEEMS I WAS WRONG THE OTHERS ALL SAID TWELVE SECONDS TOO BUT THEY WERE ALL WRONG
HE THEN GAVE ME THE PROBLEM WHICH I HAND ON TO YOU
YOUNG BLAKE AS A BRIGADIER--FUNNY ISN'T IT NOT SO VERY I SAID
A GOOD POET IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE EXIGENCIES OF RHYME BUT I AM AFRAID THAT IN ANY CASE COMMON'S REPUTATION HAD TO BE SACRIFICED TO THEM
ALL RIGHT TRY IT HE SAID
WHAT I LOVE YOU CELIA I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST
THERE'S MORE IN IT THAN THAT
IT WOULD GO IN ANYWHERE WHERE THERE WERE RATS
IT WOULD BE DISLOYAL TO PLAY ANY OTHER TUNE AFTER THAT
IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN THIS TIME AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE JENNY TO TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT
JUST PRIVATE CHADD HE WAS AND WENT TO JOIN HIS DAD'S OLD REGIMENT WHILE DAD THE DEAR OLD DUG-OUT SENT FOR RED TABS FROM THE TAILOR
HE WAS IN THE ELEVEN YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS AGO
OVER THE HEADS OF AN ENORMOUS BADLY-DRESSED AND UTTERLY INDIFFERENT CROWD SIMPSON HANDED HIS THIRTY FRANCS TO THE CROUPIER
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD ONE ANYHOW I SAID ENCOURAGINGLY
THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFF IS CONSIDERED WELL WORTH A VISIT
THEN THE PRODUCT IS 170 AND 170 IS THE NUMBER YOU HAVE GOT TO GUESS WELL THE COMPANY SELECTS A LADY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AND THE FIRST THING YOU ASK HER IS
NO DOUBT HE PLACED IT IN HIS POCKET FOR SAFETY SEVERAL MEN APPLAUDED THIS SUGGESTION FOR LORD SMITH WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE
HAPPENING TO SEE CAREY AT TEATIME I MENTIONED IT TO HIM
EVERYBODY BUT MYSELF SEEMED TO THINK THAT THIS WAS MUCH MORE FUN
ON THE FIRST DAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED SOME THREE MONTHS AGO I ROSE FROM MY CHAIR AND STOOD STIFFLY THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE--AN AFFAIR OF SOME MINUTES OWING TO A LITTLE DIFFICULTY WITH SEND HIM VICTORIOUS A LINE WHICH ALWAYS BOTHERS JOHNNY
IV IT WAS THE GALA NIGHT AT THE ROYAL CIRCUS
PEOPLE DOWN HERE SAY THAT THERE AREN'T
WATER HE MURMURED WATER A SOFT-FOOTED NURSE ROSE AND POURED SOME OVER HIM
ON THE WAY TOULON ANNOUNCED ARCHIE AS THE TRAIN CAME TO A STOP AND GAVE OUT ITS PLAINTIVE DYING WHISTLE
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE EXACTLY WELL ONE IS TUFTED I SAID DOING MY BEST AND THE OTHER--ER--CLIMBS TREES OH I SEE AND OF COURSE THE EGGS ARE MORE SPECKLED I ADDED GRADUALLY ACQUIRING CONFIDENCE
THERE YOU ARE THAT'S THE WHOLE WORD
IT WAS LAID SAFELY--A MERE NOTHING TO HIM BY THIS TIME
I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN IN PUBLIC BEFORE
AT LEAST NOT AUDIBLY
CAN YOU GUESS THE RIGHT ANSWER
BLIGHTY I THINKS--AND LAUGHED
I DID IT FOR LOVE OF YOU ROSAMUND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
WHEN MY HAIR COMES DOWN IN THE EVENING AND MY TIRED CLOTHES SWOON TO THE GROUND DO I BOTHER MY HEAD AS I LEAP IN BED OF THE TRUTH WHICH THE DAWN BRINGS ROUND
NO NO NOT JONES SHE ADDED HASTILY DOWN THE TELEPHONE AND ONCE MORE SHE REPEATED THE UNHAPPY NAME
SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE ARE SHARKS THE INDIAN OCEAN
ISN'T IT ALL LOVELY
BUT HE IS MISTAKEN
THE EFFETENESS OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY IS ABOUT TO BE PUT TO THE PROOF
MR WORPLE REPEATS THE TITLE AND THEN RECITES IN AN INTENSE VOICE THESE LINES
COWARD HE SHRIEKED
WHAT ABOUT A DOVE-COT
OH SAID CELIA WITH A DEEP SIGH BUT WE MUST LIVE HERE AN IRISH TERRIER RAN OUT TO INSPECT US
AND THAT SAID ANNE WAS THREE WEEKS AGO IT HAS BEEN THE SAME EVER SINCE I ASKED BEGINNING ON A NEW PLATE
WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS HIS CONSCIENCE HAD BEGUN TO GNAW HIM AND IN HIS DESPAIR HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AT LAST THE DAY OF RECKONING HAD COME
GIVE ME THE ORANGES AND LEMONS AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE PALMS AND THE CACTUSES AND THE OLIVES LIKE POLAR BEARS IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS SAID MYRA
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS
THE--ALL THE THINGS I CAN'T RECALL AND DOMINATING OVER ALL THE STATUES MORE THAN FULL-SIZE
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU SHOULD FORBEAR TO MAKE YOUR CLAIM UNTIL I HAVE DELIVERED MY SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS ON THE COAST EROSION BILL UPON WHICH I FEEL DEEPLY
SEE THEM IN THEIR DOZENS DRAWN DANCING TO THE CROQUET LAWN COULD OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAVE DINED IF THERE'D BEEN NO WORMS ABOVE IT
THIS MUST BE WIPED OUT IN BLOOD HE SAID SLOWLY
THIS MUST BE WIPED OUT IN BLOOD HE SAID SLOWLY
HE SEEMS TO HAVE FORMED THE ABSURD IDEA THAT I AM FOND OF HIM
MARIA THUS REVENGED HE WENT HOME TO BED AND WOKE NEXT MORNING WITH A BAD HEADACHE
HERE GARCON_--ER--_DONNEZ-MOI DU CAFE ET_--ER BUT THE WAITER HAD SLIPPED PAST HIM AGAIN--THE FIFTH TIME
HIS FIRST HAD CLEVERLY DISLODGED THE BALL FROM THE PILED-UP TEE
AT THE RISK OF BETRAYING MYSELF TO HER AS QUITE AN ORDINARY PERSON AFTER ALL I CONFESS THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT LEAVES ME PUZZLED TOO
MY FRIEND EPINARD OF THE ROULLENS AERODROME WILL ACT FOR ME
OUR TABLE HAD FINISHED BREAKFAST
BY THE TIME I HAD GOT HALF-WAY OUR RADICAL CONTEMPORARY HAD BEEN ENTIRELY EATEN
I PUT IN THE CHARGE OF THE UHLANS I SAID AND IT PLAYED GOD SAVE THE KING UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS A VERY PATRIOTIC MAN AND HE BELIEVED IT
TO-DAY IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES AND A QUARTER
THE FAIRY PRINCES THEY HAD IMAGINED TOGETHER IN THOSE DAYS
THEY HACKED THE BUTTONS OFF LORD SMITH'S TUNIC THEY DUG THE STARS OUT OF HIS SLEEVES THEY TORE THE REGIMENTAL BADGE FROM HIS CAP
YOU'LL SEE PLENTY OF US AFTERWARDS THE FIRST ONE IS BOUND TO BE A FAILURE I POINTED OUT
I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID SADLY
WOOLMAN IS GENERALLY TO BE FOUND LEAVING MY ROOMS AT ABOUT 6.30 IN THE EVENING AND A SMART DETECTIVE COULD EASILY NAB HIM AS HE STEPS OUT
GENERALLY SPEAKING GOD SAVE THE KING ENDS A SHOW
GOOD IDEA I SAID TO CELIA
SMITH JOINED GLOOMILY IN THE SEARCH
IN SPITE OF HIS IMPASSIONED PROTEST FROM THE DOCK IN SPITE OF HYACINTH'S DRAMATIC SWOON IN FRONT OF THE SOLICITOR'S TABLE THE JUDGE WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY PASSED SENTENCE OF TWENTY YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
WELL I REVIEWED MR BLANK'S BOOK ROTUNDITY AS I EXPECTED THE FIRST DRAFT HAD TO BE RE-HEADED A CORNER OF OLD LONDON AND USED ELSEWHERE
O SEVILLE
TO PREVENT THESE OCCASIONAL SEPARATIONS CELIA TOOK THEM OFF MY SLEEVES AND PUT THEM ON MY SHOULDERS
SHE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING RING AND GAVE IT TO ME
AS THIN AS WHAT I SAY WITH AS MUCH DIGNITY AS IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO HAS HAD HIS SHIRT TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM
OH I SEE SAID THE VERY YOUNG GOD AND WHEN A YEAR LATER THE HUNDRED-THOUSANDTH ENGLISH MOTHER WOKE UP TO READ THAT HER BOY HAD BEEN SHOT I AM AFRAID SHE SHED FOOLISH TEARS AND THOUGHT THAT THE WORLD HAD COME TO AN END
IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT STRICTLY SPEAKING THE LEMON IS NOT A NECESSARY ADJUNCT OF THIS TRICK
THIS ONE"--AND WITH A SUDDEN LEAP I WAS BEHIND HIM AS HE DOZED AND I HAD DASHED HIM FORWARD ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH OF A MILLIMETRE--"THIS ONE HAS AMUSED ME PERHAPS SAID CELIA THOUGHTFULLY AND I DON'T THINK IT WAS QUITE A NICE THING FOR A YOUNG WOMAN TO SAY PERHAPS WE'RE ONLY MEANT TO AMUSE THE PEOPLE IN MARS THEN I SAID LAZILY LET'S HOPE THAT THEY ARE AMUSED TEN DAYS LATER THE GREAT WAR BEGAN
SIMPSON WILL SEND IT TO ONE OF THE PICTURE PAPERS AND WE SHALL APPEAR AS ANOTHER MERRY LITTLE PARTY OF WELL-KNOWN SUN-SEEKERS
TO THINK OF THAT AND SALMON MAYONNAISE
DO YOU MIND RINGING THE BELL HE WENT ON FEELING THAT AT ALL COSTS HE MUST TURN THE CONVERSATION
RELAPSES INTO SILENCE FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING THE DUCHESS OF SOUTHBRIDGE TO LORD REGGIE OH REGGIE WHAT DID YOU SAY
I STILL THINK THAT NAPOLEON OR CANUTE OR THE YOUNGER PLINY--ONE OF THE PRE-RAPHAELITES TOOK A PERFECTLY CORRECT VIEW OF HIS CORRESPONDENCE
THERE WERE TWO KINGS ON THRONES OF GOLD THE ONE WAS YOUNG THE OTHER OLD
YOU START THREE HOURS IN ADVANCE OF THE BATTALION WHICH MEANS THAT IF THE BATTALION LEAVES AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING YOU ARE UP IN THE FRESH OF THE DAY WHEN THE BIRDS ARE SINGING
I AM SORRY I AM LATE I APOLOGIZED BUT I HAVE BEEN PUTTING ON FLESH HAVE YOU REALLY GONE UP SHE ASKED EXCITEDLY
ANYHOW THE BULGARS ALWAYS WENT ABOUT IN THEM
PERHAPS HE WILL BELIEVE A FELLOW ANOTHER TIME
THE DOCTOR KNOWS
ON TEN SUNDAYS IN SUCCESSION HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ATTEND CHURCH PARADE WHAT TIME THE MAJOR AND ROSAMUND WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES ON THE GOLF LINKS
A TRAGEDY CHAPTER I THE JOKE WAS BORN ONE OCTOBER DAY IN THE TRENCH CALLED MECHANICS NOT SO FAR FROM LOOS
YOU WERE EITHER THERE OR NOT THERE
HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU LET THE DEAD PAST BURY ITS DEAD I IMPLORED
ARE YOU ALONE I GRIPPED HER WRIST SUDDENLY AND PUT THE PAPER-KNIFE TO HER THROAT
RATHER LET HIM FAIL AT US WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE BEAUTIFUL THAN AT THE GARDEN WHICH HAS ITS REPUTATION YET TO MAKE
ACCORDINGLY THE GODS GOT TO WORK
THE DOOR OPENED AND MAJOR MURGATROYD SECOND IN COMMAND OF THE FAMOUS BLANKSHIRES CAME IN
YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE
SHE WAS THE LAST PERSON I WANTED AT THAT MOMENT
NOW YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY DID I NOT SEND A POLITE NOTE TO JOHNNY'S FATHER ASKING HIM TO RESTRAIN HIS LITTLE BOY FROM OVER-COMPOSITION BEGGING HIM NOT TO FORCE THE CHILD'S MUSICAL GENIUS TOO QUICKLY IMPLORING HIM IN SHORT TO LOCK UP THE PIANO AND LOSE THE KEY
IT'S THE SYSTEM BY WHICH WHEN YOU'VE LOST ALL YOUR OWN MONEY YOU TURN TO THE MAN NEXT TO YOU AND SAY LEND ME A LOUIS DEAR OLD CHAP TILL CHRISTMAS
WHAT IS IT I ASKED
BEFORE LUNCH I FOUND MYRA IN THE HAMMOCK AT THE END OF THE LOGGIA
DID BEAUTY SOME MAY ASK SEVERELY VISIT HIM IN NO OTHER GUISE
HERE THIS IS THE ONE
WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN--HOW NOW A RAT
SHE MAY BE RIGHT
YOU WILL FIND HIM IN THE LIBRARY AS ALGERNON ENTERED THE LIBRARY LORD BLIGHT LOOKED UP FROM THE MAP HE WAS STUDYING AND NODDED
EXIT GUEST HIS VISIT HAS BEEN SHORT BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY THRILLING WHILE IT LASTED
I THOUGHT AS YOU USED TO BE MATHEMATICAL AND AS I'D PROMISED THE GIRL WAIT A MOMENT I SAID STILL BUSY WITH MY ENVELOPE
AH THEN I'LL GO AND TELL ARTHUR--_[EXIT TO LIBRARY LEAVING MISS DEVEREUX AND LORD LARKSPUR ALONE
I DROPPED IN
WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY
INDEED IT IS MARKED IN THE CATALOGUE AT ONE-AND-SIX-PENCE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY OFFER ME THE NINE-SHILLING SIZE FIRST
HE HURRIED BACK TO HIS BED-SITTING-ROOM SEIZED A PEN AND BEGAN TO WRITE
OF COURSE YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MYSELF TILL LAST WEEK THAT CH STANDS FOR CHAMPION ON THE MALE SIDE CHAMPION GOODWOOD LO IS BINGO'S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER
I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE BOMBING OFFICER
MY MUSE A MORE DOMESTICATED MAID ASPIRES TO SING A SONG OF MARMALADE
HAVING REDUCED THEM TO POWDER YOU COVER THE BASIN WITH ANOTHER HANDKERCHIEF WHICH YOU BORROW FROM A MEMBER OF THE COMPANY AND ANNOUNCE THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE A PLUM-PUDDING
AH THE DEAR OLD TUNE
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT
NOW THEN I'LL GIVE ANY OF YOU THREE GUESSES WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT NO YOU DON'T
YET I SIT HERE AND ASK MYSELF WONDERINGLY WHY IS THE FAT WOMAN'S FACE SO RED
I BLUSH TO SAY THAT IT MAY POSSIBLY BE GERMAN
WAR SKETCHES PROTESTED THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE A BOOK AT ALL IF I LEFT THEM OUT
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT PERSONALLY I SHOULD NOT BE SORRY TO SEE THINGS LIKE PORRIDGE AGAIN
BUT THAT WAS ALL
SOME SPOKE TO HIM
SAME OLD WHISTLE AND SAME OLD BANG AND ME OUT AGAIN TO BE IT TWAS UP BY LOOS I GOT ME FIRST
WOULD I LOVE HIS DARLING LAFORGUE
HE WON'T WALK UP THE GENTLEST SLOPE
WE MIGHT DRIVE OVER AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT III FORTUNATELY THE WEATHER HELD UP
ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE IN MARS KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE ISN'T ANYBODY ON THE EARTH
EACH TO HIS TASTE
I HOPE THAT HIS MAJESTY THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN THE LATE DR BULL OR WHOEVER IS MOST CONCERNED WILL SYMPATHIZE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THAT THIS TIME I REMAINED SEATED
NOW WE CAN DISCUSS THE PROSPECTS FOR THE SEASON IN PEACE I TOOK UP THE SPORTSMAN AGAIN
INDEED IT WAS NECESSARY BEFORE I BEGAN THAT I SHOULD TURN TO MY AUDIENCE AND DESCRIBE THE SCENE TO THEM--IN THE MANNER BUT NOT IN THE WORDS OF A QUEEN'S HALL PROGRAMME ER--FIRST OF ALL YOU HEAR THE CAVALRY GALLOPING PAST AND THEN THERE'S A SHORT HYMN BEFORE ACTION WHILE THEY FORM UP AND THEN COMES THE CHARGE AND THEN THERE'S A SLOW BIT WHILE THEY--ER--PICK UP THE WOUNDED AND THEN THEY TROT SLOWLY BACK AGAIN
I HAILED THEM WITH A HAPPY LAUGH AND SLAPPED OLD SAMSON ON THE CALF AND ASKED A MEMBER OF THE STAFF FOR OFFICERS DEMOBBING THAT EVENING BEING THEN DISPERSED I SWORE AS I HAD SWORN IT FIRST WHEN THREE OF US WENT ON THE BURST WITH AUNT OR GREAT-AUNT ALICE ALTHOUGH ONE FINDS AS MAN OR BOY A THOUSAND PLEASURES TO ENJOY FOR HAPPINESS WITHOUT ALLOY GIVE ME THE CRYSTAL PALACE V
THESE ARE SMALL MATTERS BUT THEY ARE VERY TRYING TO A FATHER HAVE YOU ANY COPPERS ASKED MYRA SUDDENLY
IT WAS THAT WHEN HE CRASHED HE SHOULD CRASH ON SOME OF GASPARD'S FAMILY
THANKS SAID THE MAJOR
ONLY DON'T TELL ANYBODY
AT ANY COST SHE MUST KNOW THE WORST
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I SAID AT LAST IS TO WRITE A REALLY LONG LETTER TO MRS CARDEW ACQUAINTING HER WITH ALL THE FACTS
A SECRET DOCUMENT OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE WENT ON THE COLONEL HAS JUST REACHED ME FROM THE WAR OFFICE
CHARMING
THOMAS HIDES HERE FOR A BIT
REFUSED A PRESSING INVITATION TO STAY TO LUNCH ALTHOUGH IT WAS A HOT DAY AND I HAD A LONG WALK BACK TO MY OWN MESS I HANDED THE BOOK BACK TO BLAKE
FORTUNATELY--IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION--THE SEASON WILL BE A SHORT ONE
THE OTHER IS MERELY HIS ATTENDANT
1 WHAT WAS FUNNY AND 2 WHICH OF US WAS WRITING THE REVUE
I CANNOT BE CERTAIN
AND THEN ANOTHER NOTE
I DISREGARDED THE FF.'S AND THE OTHER SIGN-POSTS ON THE WAY AND GAVE IT MY OWN INTERPRETATION
IT IS NOT OFTEN I DO THIS BECAUSE BEFORE ONE CAN REVIEW A BOOK ONE HAS TO OR IS SUPPOSED TO READ IT WHICH WASTES A GOOD DEAL OF TIME
ER--OH LOOK HERE HERBERT I'M RATHER BUSY THIS MORNING
HERE'S THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF COMING IN I HANDED THE TELEPHONE TO CELIA
BINGO ARRIVED AS AN ABSURD LITTLE BLACK TUB OF PUPPINESS WARRANTED BY A PEDIGREE AS LONG AS YOUR ARM TO GROW INTO A PEKINESE
SOMETHING SHE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT TOLD HER THAT THIS WAS NOT LOVE
MOST OF THE CHARACTERS SEEM TO BE ON THE STAGE AND FOR ONCE WE DO NOT ASK HOW THEY GOT THERE
A BOTTLE OF SHERRY FRESHLY UNCORKED STOOD UPON THE SIDEBOARD IN THE DINING-ROOM
THERE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON AS TO WHETHER HE IS A COWARD OR NOT
WITH THE FRENCH AND BRITISH I HAD OF COURSE NO DIFFICULTY AND THE BULGARS FORTUNATELY WERE CONTENT WITH HOARSE GUTTURAL NOISES
WELL YOU'RE THE FIRST SO YOU'LL SET THE TONE
WELL I AM SAID FATHER CLOSING HIS EYES
AT THE EDGE OF THE CROWD STRONG MEN WOULD SWOON
WE POSTED IT
PRESIDENTS ARE ELECTED BY POPULAR ACCLAMATION
ONE NIGHT HE WAS DOZING BY HIS CAMP-FIRE WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED ROUGHLY BY STRONG ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND JASPER'S HOT BREATH IN HIS EAR
SO I WAS PASSED ALONG INTO THE CROWD AS BROWNIE
UNFORTUNATELY SHE DOES NOT LIKE HERRINGS
ONE LIKES TO KNOW
IT WAS HIS TURN I KNEW YOU SAID MARY DO YOU REMEMBER MARY BLUSHED AND JOHN DID NOT DEVIATE FROM THE HEALTHY RED COLOUR WHICH HE HAD MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION
WE ANTICIPATE A SLUMBERING AUDIENCE AND SAMUEL EXPLAINING A NEW KIND OF GOOGLIE HE'S INVENTED ENTERED THOMAS LAZILY
RURITANIA OFFERED THE APOLOGY THE INDEMNITY AND THE PUBLIC DEGRADATION OF CAPTAIN TOMSK BUT URGED THAT THIS LAST CEREMONY WOULD BE BETTER PERFORMED BY THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE RURITANIAN ARMY
I MUST HURRY ON
WE HAD TEA IN THE GARDEN THAT AFTERNOON AND A BIRD OF SOME KIND STRUCK UP IN THE PLANE-TREE
JOHN WHO DID NOT LOOK HIS BEST IN A FROCK-COAT HAD PLEADED FOR A QUIET WEDDING AND ONLY THE DUCHESS OF BILBERRY AND MR PUMP WERE PRESENT AT THE SIMPLE CEREMONY WHICH TOOK PLACE AT THE BLOOMSBURY REGISTRY-OFFICE
OF COURSE MY DEAR OLD CHAP
IT WAS NAPOLEON'S IDEA OR DR JOHNSON'S OR MARK ANTONY'S--ONE OF THAT CIRCLE THAT ALL CORRESPONDENCE CAN BE TREATED IN THIS MANNER
THE JOKE LAY IN ONE OF THE FEW NOTICES WHICH THE BOOK RECEIVED FROM THE PRESS
THE BALLAD OF PRIVATE CHADD I SING OF GEORGE AUGUSTUS CHADD WHO'D ALWAYS FROM A BABY HAD A DEEP AFFECTION FOR HIS DAD IN OTHER WORDS HIS FATHER
HAD WE CHOSEN A SUFFICIENTLY CHINESE NAME FOR HIM
YOU FLY NO
BUT IT'S A SILLY THING TO SAY IT'S HOLIDAY TIME I REMINDED HER
AND IN THE DEPTHS OF THE PALACE HI-YOU THE SWINEHERD WAS HARD AT WORK COMPOUNDING A POTION WHICH HE ASSURED THE KING WOULD RESTORE FREDERICK TO HIS OWN PRINCELY FORM
WE MIGHT RING UP THE ADMIRALTY AND ASK THEM TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO DO THIS EVENING
ER--THESE ARE--_CES SONT MES AMIS
OR THERE I BROKE OFF SUDDENLY
MAGNIFICENT IS IT NOT MAGNIFICENT I SAID REMEMBERING AN APPOINTMENT INSTEAD
IF YOU KEEP ON SAYING IT A CERTAIN OLD-WORLD CHARM SEEMS TO GATHER ROUND IT
GO ON I WISH I HAD MARRIED SOMEBODY CALLED JONES SAID CELIA LOOKING UP AT ME RATHER REPROACHFULLY
BUT NO I WOULD HAVE YOUR EXACT AGE
IN EARLY DAYS THE COLONEL'S SHUN FROZE ME
FOR A MOMENT JOHN WAS ALMOST PARALYSED AT CONTEMPLATION OF IT
IF THE PAPER WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL SECOND LIEUTENANTS WERE TO BECOME LIEUTENANTS AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS SERVICE
I BENT DOWN AND PATTED IT
WE CAN'T HELP OUR LOOKS I SAID IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE
SO THAT IF THERE IS TO BE A PROFIT AT ALL AS PRESUMABLY THEY ANTICIPATE I SHALL HAVE A GATE OF AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I SHOULD HOPE SO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
WE HAVE ALSO WITH US MR AND MRS ARCHIBALD MANNERING A DELIGHTFUL COUPLE
HE FELT THAT THEY WERE RIVALS FOR THE HAND OF ROSAMUND BLOWHARD
I KNOW NOT WHAT I ONLY KNOW THAT NOW SHE STOOD AT HOME IN NEED OF MR BROWN AND I HAD PLEDGED MYSELF TO HER ASSISTANCE
AND MOREOVER WAS INTRODUCED TO A FRENCH MAIDEN OF TWO WITH WHOM AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE SECONDS IN THE BUSINESS--HER MOTHER AND MYSELF--A PROLONGED BUT MONOTONOUS CONVERSATION IN THE FRENCH TONGUE ENSUED COMMON UNDER SUITABLE PRESSURE BARKING IDIOMATICALLY AND THE MAIDEN CAREFULLY PROMPTED REPLYING WITH THE NATIVE FOR BOW-WOW A PRETTY GREENWOOD SCENE BENEATH THE APPLE-TREES AND IN ANY DECENT CIVILIZATION THE GREAT ADVENTURE WOULD HAVE ENDED THERE
THOMAS HE CRIES
BUT HI-YOU HIMSELF NEVER LEFT THE PALACE
BUT A WEEK'S QUIET PRACTICE AT HOME WILL GIVE HIM ALL THE SKILL THAT IS NECESSARY
OUI N'EST CE PAS
HE STOLE THE DOCUMENTS FROM HER FATHER
BUT I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO THINK THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD OUR YOUNGEST OUR LITTLE PHILOMENE SHOES AND STOCKINGS
DASH IT ALL
I HAD IT PUT IN AT ENORMOUS EXPENSE
I EXPECT WE SHALL BE ALL RIGHT SHE SAID
TO HAVE HAD A CROWD IN TO SEE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNNECESSARY
I TOOK THE LETTER ALONG AND DROPPED IT INTO THE SLIT
BUT WITH MYRA AND ME THE CASE OF COURSE IS DIFFERENT
NOT INITIALS I SAID AND I FELT IN SOME MORE POCKETS BUT--BUT I TRIED THE TROUSERS POCKETS AGAIN
IT HAPPENED TO ME
THERE'S SURE TO BE LOTS YES THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT
THE IMPRESARIO AND I AGREED UPON MANY THINGS--AS FOR INSTANCE THAT THE WAR WOULD BE A LONG ONE AND THAT HINDENBURG WAS NO FOOL--BUT THERE WERE TWO POINTS UPON WHICH WE COULD NEVER QUITE AGREE
WHAT ARE SUITABLE APARTMENTS THE KING PULLED AT HIS BEARD AND REGARDED FREDERICK DOUBTFULLY
HOWEVER THE NEXT AFTERNOON A MORE UNFORTUNATE OCCURRENCE OCCURRED
DEAR SIR--I DO NOT WISH TO INTERFERE UNDULY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THESE FLATS BUT I FEEL BOUND TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT FOR MANY WEEKS NOW THERE HAS BEEN A FLOW OF WATER FROM YOUR BATHROOM WHICH HAS PENETRATED THROUGH THE CEILING OF MY BATHROOM PARTICULARLY AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN USING THE ROOM IN THE MORNINGS
IT'S FUNNY WHY IT SHOULD BE SO LATE THIS YEAR IS THAT THE SAME AS THE TREE PIPIT SAID MY HOSTESS WHO SEEMED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BIRDS THAN I HAD HOPED
MY LORD MAYOR MY LORDS I DON'T WANT TO INTERRUPT SAID CELIA COMING IN SUDDENLY BUT--OH WHAT'S A POT-HOLE A CURIOUS UNDERGROUND CAVERN SOMETIMES FOUND IN THE NORTH AREN'T CAVERNS ALWAYS UNDERGROUND
MANAGER
MANAGER
MANAGER
THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE
AH DO YOU NEED TO ASK
ANY RELATION NONE SAID SMITHLORD CROSSING HIS THUMBS UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES
POLWOLLOP SEEMED A HUNDRED YEARS AWAY
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY INSTEAD
NOR WERE CHILDREN OF TWELVE ALLOWED IN WITHOUT THEIR PERAMBULATORS WELL ANYHOW SAID BOBBY I BET PHYLLIS CAN BOWL BETTER THAN YOU IS THIS TRUE I SAID TO PHYLLIS
IF I HAVE BEEN A BAD CORRESPONDENT IN THE PAST I AM A GOOD ONE NOW
YET YOU PROMISED YOU WOULD
THEY'RE VERY PRETTY YOU KNOW I KNOW
MY USUAL SCORE I SAID NOT MY HIGHEST VI
YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE A COAL-PARTY AND INVITE ALL YOUR FRIENDS
BLESS YOU SAID CELIA HAVE YOU GOT IT
MY BLESSINGS THEN ON THE GOLDEN TONGUE OF THE MANAGER
IT WAS WAITING FOR HIM
FIRE 9--12 WHAT A LOVELY IDEA SAID ANNE SMILING FROM SHEER HABIT
ONE DAY HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING BACK TO CANADA
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND THE SWORD AT LAST WE SHEATHE I'M GOING TO KEEP A JELLY-FISH AND LISTEN TO IT BREATHE
AT SIX-THIRTY I HAD JUST FINISHED DRESSING AFTER MY THIRD COLD BATH SINCE LUNCH WHEN CELIA TAPPED ON THE DOOR
SHE WOULDN'T KNOW THE POINT IS THIS I SAID FIRMLY OUR PUPPY IS MEANT FOR A PEKINESE--THE PEDIGREE SAYS SO
S FOR ANOTHER SISTER--I'LL TELL YOU HER NAME DIRECTLY
HE ONLY CONDUCTS
PROBABLY THEY ARE BOTH WRONG I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THINGS SIGHED CELIA
AND SO RESUMED HIS SLOPING
AT LEAST HE LORD A
WHAT'S THE MATTER
THAT THIS CAN NOW BE DONE WE HAVE TO THANK THE WELL-KNOWN INVENTOR OF THE TELEPHONE
WHO ISN'T I SAID WITH A SHRUG AND TO GET THE CONVERSATION ON TO SAFER GROUND I ADDED HASTILY THAT IN SOME WAYS I ALMOST LIKED CONSOLATRICE BEST
T FOR TWO SISTERS THESE TWO THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE MAJOR SALUTED IMPRESSIVELY AND THE COLONEL ROSE AND RETURNED HIS SALUTE WITH THE POLITENESS TYPICAL OF THE BRITISH ARMY
UP TO THIS MOMENT I HAD BEEN RATHER ATTACHED TO MY NAME
THE PAST IS THE PAST AS WORDSWORTH PROBABLY SAID TO COLERIDGE MORE THAN ONCE
I KNEW A YOUNG MAN WHO MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE'S MOTHER AND WAS ALLOWED BY HER FOURTEEN GARDENERS TO AMUSE HIMSELF SOMETIMES BY ROLLING THE TENNIS-COURT
AS MR GARVIN WELL POINTS OUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A FALSE PERSPECTIVE OF THE WAR
I THINK IT IS TIME I EXPLAINED MY SUPPOSED FRIENDSHIP FOR ERNEST MERROWBY WOOLMAN--CONFOUND HIM
HOWEVER IT WAS EASIER THAN I THOUGHT
ALL WE WANT TO KNOW IS DOES BARLOW EVER LET IT IN THE SUMMER THAT'S IT SAID CELIA EAGERLY
HALLO I SAID
AN AEROPLANE SWOOPED DOWN UPON THEM AND HYACINTH WAS SNATCHED FROM HIS ARMS AND DISAPPEARED WITH HER CAPTORS INTO THE CLOUDS
BUT WON'T YOU GIVE US SOMETHING ELSE
WE WENT BACK TO THE OTHERS
DO THEY GIVE YOU ANY MONEY FOR IT THEY ASK ME TO NAME MY FEE THEN SAY A THOUSAND POUNDS AND LECTURE ON THE NEED FOR MORE ELECTRIC LIGHT
THE WHOLE MACHINE WAS SHOUTING EIGHT-STONE-ELEVEN AS LOUDLY AS IT COULD
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS IN THE PAPER ABOUT PROMOTION SHE SAID EAGERLY
THE CARD SAID MRS PHILBY PHIPP AT HOME AND IN A CORNER DANCING 10 P.M NO MORE--EXCEPT A DATE A HINT IN FRENCH THAT A REPLY WOULD NOT BE DEEMED OFFENSIVE AND MOST IMPORTANT MRS PHIPP'S ADDRESS
I WAS LUNCHING WITH WILLIAM NEXT DAY AND I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE SUBALTERN
IT WAS MY FAMOUS SCORE WHICH HAD DECIDED THE FIGURE THAT WAS TO BRING US FORTUNE
A GUNNER OFFICER BROKE INTO VERSE--A PAINFUL BUSINESS
A BIT OF A SCRAP WITH A FOREIGN POWER WOULD DO US ALL THE GOOD IN THE WORLD HE DISPOSED OF HIS WHISKY AT A DRAUGHT
AND ANYBODY WHO HAPPENED TO MENTION WHEN DINING WITH US THAT HE WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH A NEW AND POWERFUL ILLUMINANT WAS HANDED HIS HAT AT ONCE
SHE WAS ORDERING A LITTLE FISH FOR MY LUNCH AND THE FISHMONGER WHEN ASKED THE PRICE OF HERRINGS REPLIED THREE HA'PENCE FOR ONE AND A HALF TO WHICH MY HOUSEKEEPER SAID THEN I WILL HAVE TWELVE HOW MUCH DID SHE PAY HE SMILED HAPPILY AT THE COMPANY
BY THIS NOVEL THE AUTHOR HAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED HIS CLAIM TO BE RECKONED AMONG THE FEW LIVING NOVELISTS WHO COUNT BUT STAY
PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S THOMAS'S TURN TO STEP ON SIMPSON
MERCI HE SAID MERCI
QUITE MUCH HOW MUCH
THEY HAD COMPARED PICTURE POST CARDS OF LEWIS WALLER
MY TIE I CANNOT DWELL UPON MY TIE ENOUGH THAT ALL WAS NEAT HARMONIOUS AND SUITABLE TO MRS PHILBY PHIPP
IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SMACK BOBBY'S HEAD BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT FOR HIM
CUTTING A SMALL HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE HANDKERCHIEF YOU DROP A LIGHTED MATCH THROUGH THE APERTURE
IT LIKES EIGHT-STONE-ELEVEN PEOPLE WE WILL GIVE IT I SAID ONE MORE CHANCE NEXT MORNING THE WEIGHTS WERE AS I HAD LEFT THEM AND I STEPPED ON WITHOUT MUCH HOPE EXPECTING THAT THE BAR WOULD COME SLOWLY UP TO ITS MIDWAY POSITION OF REST
YOURS SINCERELY HERBERT ASQUITH FAITHFULLY YOURS J
I THOUGHT YOU SAID LOBSTER YOU CAN'T PUT LOBSTER IN CIDER CUP SAID CELIA SEVERELY
CHAPTER IV BUT AT LAST THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY CAME
THERE WERE EIGHT OF US
HE WAS WONDERING HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET A BOOK ABOUT BIRDS DOWN FROM LONDON AND DECIDING THAT IT COULDN'T BE DONE THAT AFTERNOON
PERHAPS IT'S MIZPAH OR ICHABOD OR HABAKKUK I'M SURE THERE'S A WORD YOU PUT ON RINGS--I EXPECT THEY'D KNOW AT THE SHOP BUT I DON'T WANT WHAT THEY KNOW AT SHOPS
I WAIT NERVOUSLY FOR THE WORD COAL FEELING THAT I SHALL SCREAM WHEN IT COMES
R FOR ROSE
AND LOOK THERE'S A LEMON TREE
WELL I MUST BE GOING
IT CANNOT BE THAT SALMON MERELY SHOULD BRING THE MIST BEFORE HIS EYES
BUT I AM MAJOR MURGATROYD MAJOR MURGATROYD THEY ALL CRIED
THE GREAT ART OF THE STAGE-CRAFTSMAN AS I HAVE ALREADY SHOWN IS TO SEEM NATURAL RATHER THAN TO BE NATURAL
HERBERT'S FACE HAD ALREADY ASSUMED A LOOK OF STRAINED EXPECTANCY
AT THAT MOMENT THE BAND STRUCK UP AND RICHARD LEAPT LIGHTLY ON TO THE SWINGING BAR
A NEW EXPERIMENT IS TO BE TRIED THIS SEASON AND SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO BOWL FOR AN ODD FIVE-MINUTES AT THE END OF DICK'S INNINGS TO ME
AND THEN TO MAKE THE MATTER PLAIN I HOLD--AT LAST!--A BAT AGAIN
BUT STILL PERHAPS I'D BETTER TAKE IT BACK TO SCOTLAND YARD TO-MORROW AND TELL THEM YOU'VE KEPT IT FOR A YEAR
THOMAS WE SAY YOU HERE
IT ISN'T AT ALL AN EASY LETTER TO WRITE SAID MYRA
WHEN WE'RE A LITTLE HIGHER UP I SHALL SAY SURELY THAT'S CORSICA AND YOU'LL SAY NOT CORSICA AS THOUGH YOU'D RATHER EXPECTED THE ISLE OF WIGHT
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME SHE SAID
I LOOKED HOPEFULLY AT MYRA
GOOD HEAVENS I WAS EIGHT-STONE-FOURTEEN
IT WAS AN INTERESTING AFTERNOON
AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF FIVE MINUTES I SHALL SWING MY CLUB AND PROBABLY MISS
HE BRIGHTENED UP A LITTLE
IT WAS SIMPLY THAT HE WAS TO RING HER UP AS SOON AS HE CAME IN
SOON THAT HAD DISSOLVED TOO
I AM AFRAID HE IS GOING TO BE TROUBLESOME SUGGESTED LORD BLIGHT
THIS WOULD INTEREST THOMAS IF HE WEREN'T ASLEEP I SAID
IT WENT FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLOP I LISTENED INTENTLY HOPING FOR MORE
BUT HE HAD SPOKEN A MOMENT TOO SOON
GEORGE'S V.C
RIGHT DOWN TO THE LETTER-BOX IN THE HALL
TWO DAYS LATER IT APPEARED
HOWEVER IT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT TO ASSUME DEAR READER THAT IN YOUR PLAY LORD ARTHUR HAD A GOOD REASON FOR COMING IN
I AM SLIGHTLY BETTER ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT HE RUNS HIS PENCIL UP AND DOWN ME AND PRODUCES THAT PLEASING NOISE WHICH SMALL BOYS GET BY DRAGGING A STICK ALONG RAILINGS
V WHEN HE RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS RICHARD FOUND HIMSELF ON THE S.S
AND I--I COULDN'T DO WITHOUT HIM
SO I THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD IT FIRST I SAID GIVING HIM A GENTLE SMILE
HIGH ABOVE THE VILLAGE A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA WE RESTED AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SILVERY OLIVES STRETCHING INTO THE BLUE
QUESTION 6 AND FINALLY AND BEST OF ALL WE HAD SAT IN THE SUN UNDER A BLUE SKY ABOVE A BLUE SEA AND WATCHED THE ORANGES AND LEMONS GROW
I LOVE YOU SHE WENT ON
SO I WROTE TO A FRIEND OF MINE AND ASKED HIM TO SEND ME OUT ONE AND SOME FILMS AND THINGS JUST AS A SURPRISE FOR YOU SAMUEL YOU ARE A DEAR SAID MYRA LOOKING AT HIM LOVINGLY
STOP HIM CRIED RICHARD FROM UNDERNEATH A SACK OF FLOUR
ONE STAR OCCASIONALLY I RECEIVE LETTERS FROM FRIENDS WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN LATELY ADDRESSED TO LIEUTENANT M
AND OF COURSE WE ONLY SAW IT FROM OUTSIDE
I SHOULD SAY HE ADDED HASTILY WE GO BACK NEXT MONTH MY OWN PRIVATE OPINION WAS THAT THE SOONER HE RETURNED TO DEVONSHIRE THE BETTER
WELL I SEE I MUST TELL YOU
MR THOMAS TODD IS IN THE SUCKING-A-RULER-AND-LOOKING-OUT-OF-THE-WINDOW DEPARTMENT OF THE ADMIRALTY BY WHOSE EXERTIONS SO LONG AS WE PRESERVE THE 2 TODDS TO 1 FORMULA--OR EXCLUDING CANADIAN TODDS 16 TO 10--BRITANNIA RULES THE WAVES
THEY'D BE ALL OVER THE PLACE DAHLIA EXPLAINED THE DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
WITH AN OCCASIONAL GLANCE THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AT CELIA
HOW THEN CAN I FIGHT
I'M PRETENDING I'M A BAT AND I KNOW I LIKE IT MURKY
REGRETS THAT HIS DUTIES AS A SECOND LIEUTENANT PREVENT HIM FROM REPLYING PERSONALLY TO THE MANY KIND INQUIRIES HE HAS RECEIVED AND BEGS TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY OF ANNOUNCING THAT HE STILL RETAINS A STAR ON EACH SHOULDER
I'LL DO STRAW SAID PETER GENEROUSLY WHEREUPON CELIA VOLUNTEERED FOR BREAKS THERE WERE SEVEN OF US FOR NINE WORDS
AH SAID CAREY PROFOUNDLY
COMMON SEATED IN YOUR COMFORTABLE CLUB MY VERY DEAR SIR OR IN YOUR DELIGHTFUL DRAWING-ROOM MADAM YOU MAY SMILE PITYINGLY AT THE IDEA OF A MASCOT SAVING ANYBODY'S LIFE
SOFT MUSIC FELL AND THE KALEIDOSCOPE OF LOVELY WOMAN GLIDED SWAYED AND TURNED BENEATH THE SHADED LIGHTS
HALLO WE HAD JUST PASSED THE NARROW ARCHWAY LEADING INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE VILLAGE AND WERE FOLLOWING THE PATH UP THE HILL
I LOVE YOU
ENTER LORD LARKSPUR AND MISS DEVEREUX L THIS IS VERY IMMATURE EVEN IF YOU ARE QUITE CLEAR AS TO WHICH SIDE OF THE STAGE IS L
OH LOOK HERE MYRA DO YOU--NO DON'T COME
A HANGING GARDEN IN BABYLON ARE YOU TAKING ME TO THE FLOWER SHOW THIS AFTERNOON ASKED CELIA AT BREAKFAST
OH I BEG PARDON_.]--AND FOR SOME WEEKS THEY LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER
SHE PIERCED BENEATH THE IMAGINATION OF THE NOVELIST TO THE RECOLLECTION OF THE MAN
I PUSHED THE-THING-YOU-MOVE-UP-AND-DOWN BACK TO THE ZERO POSITION AND EXCHANGED THE HALF-STONE WEIGHT FOR A STONE ONE
NO PERHAPS NOT I SAID THOUGHTFULLY
NOW I SAID DRAMATICALLY AND I UNWRAPPED MY PURCHASE AND PLACED IT IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR NEW-MADE GARDEN
I WANT DOUBLE-NINE--HAL-_LO
THE RANGE OF A MILLS BOMB IS ABOUT FIFTY YARDS
AND AS PROOF THAT WE HAD NOT REALLY BEEN AT BRIGHTON THERE WERE AS I HAVE SAID THE LUGGAGE LABELS
SHE TOO HAS MY PROMISE THAT I WILL PUT ON FLESH
OF HOPE AS HE HAD FONDLED AGAIN HIS TREASURED BOOKS AND READ THEIR TITLES OR GAZED AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY
BOTHER I SUPPOSE IT WILL SAID CELIA AND VERY RELUCTANTLY SHE TOOK ONE STAR OFF EACH SHOULDER LEAVING THE MATTER--SO
EVEN THEN HE KNEW THAT HE MUST BE A WRITER WHEN HE GREW UP
I SUPPOSE THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY I HAD BEEN TOO HUMOROUS--ANYWAY THE TONE HAD BEEN SET
HOWEVER THAT DIDN'T GET US ANY NEARER
AND AFTER THAT THEY FEASTED
AN EARLY ARTICLE OMITTED FROM THREE PREVIOUS VOLUMES PARADED FOR THE FOURTH TIME WITH SUCH A PATHETIC I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T WANT ME IN ITS EYE THAT IT COULD NOT DECENTLY BE REJECTED
SIMPSON YOU HAVE BETWEEN NOW AND 3.30 TO-MORROW TO PERFECT YOUR FRENCH DELIVERY OF THE MAGIC WORD DIX-SEPT I WENT TO BED A PROUD BUT ANXIOUS MAN THAT NIGHT
HERE WHERE IS THE BLESSED THING HE FELT IN HIS POCKETS
YOU THEN INFORM THE COMPANY THAT YOU WILL ASK ANY ONE OF THEM THREE QUESTIONS AND BY THE WAY THEY ARE ANSWERED YOU WILL GUESS WHAT THE PRODUCT OF THE TWO NUMBERS IS
HERE WE SAY GOOD-BYE TO HUMPHREY FOR THE PRESENT
ABOUT TERMS
WHO WAS HE THIS MYSTERIOUS PATIENT IN NUMBER X BED
I NEED NOT SAY THAT MANY A BULGAR HAD LICKED THE WATTLES BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
I DON'T SUGGEST ONE OF THOSE AND I POINTED TO A SUMMER-HOUSE OR EVEN A WEATHER-COCK
BUT WE DO NOT FEEL SO SURE THAT MOTHER IS ENJOYING HERSELF
A WINDOW-BOX
OH THANKS VERY MUCH I SAID AND I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE STEP
SAY THIRTY-FIVE SHILLINGS
AND MORE YEARS ROLLED ON
SISTER YOU'LL HAVE TO SPELL IT SAID CELIA
EVEN A DUKE CANNOT HAVE EVERYTHING
FORGIVE ME MY BOY SAID MR BELLINGHAM FOR THE WRONG I DID YOU
IF I AM NOT GAINING ON MY ORIGINAL ONE STAR AT LEAST I AM KEEPING PACE WITH IT
THAT MEANT--ER--THAT MEANT--WELL IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO PUT IT COLLOQUIALLY BUT ROUGHLY IT MEANS"--HE MADE A GESTURE WITH HIS HAND--"THAT WE HAVE--ER--BEEN HAVING VERY CHARMING WEATHER LATELY HE FROWNED VIGOROUSLY AT THE SWINEHERD
FORTUNATELY THERE ARE A FEW SIMPLE CONJURING TRICKS WHICH ARE WITHIN THE REACH OF US ALL
HERE WE SEE ORANGES AGAINST A BLUE SKY A MILLION MILES DEEP
PERHAPS I HAD BETTER READ IT TO YOU THIS TIME HE PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES--A PRESENT FROM AN AUNT--AND READ AS FOLLOWS MY LORD,--WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT A CLAIMANT TO THE TITLE HAS ARISEN
THINK OF THE LONG DRAWN-OUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER
AND I KNOW ONE OF THE FLORINS HAS TO--NO IT'S NO GOOD I CAN'T REMEMBER IT
FANCY READING ON A LOVELY MORNING LIKE THIS I COMPLAINED
THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE CITY NOWADAYS AND I WANT TO WRITE A PLAY INSTEAD
NO I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF WRITING IN THE ARMY AND I NEVER WANT TO SIGN MY OWN NAME AGAIN
DASH IT ALL WHO HAD BEEN DOING THE LISTENING FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR
IT'S ONLY A MILE
I HAD THE HONOUR OF OPENING IT
THE TELEPHONE LINE FROM HEADQUARTERS TO D COMPANY ALWAYS SEEMED TO WANT ATTENTION WHATEVER PART OF THE LINE WE WERE IN
BRAVE LITTLE BINGO
ANY OF THE SISTERS I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT
NOT BAD AH BUT WAIT
HUMPHREY'S ANCESTRY IS UNKNOWN
ONE WAY AND ANOTHER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE LAST PAGE WAS REACHED
THEN LIKE LIGHTNING HE SAW HIS CHANCE AND TOOK IT
LORD REGGIE PUTTING UP HIS EYEGLASS
THIS IS A TERRIBLE DISASTER FOR THE COUNTRY THIS COAL STRIKE HE SAID
TO BE SECONDED AND TO RETAIN HIS PRESENT RANK OF SECOND LIEUTENANT OR EVEN THIS
ROTATION OF CROPS AND--WHAT NOT ACCORDINGLY WE MADE OUR WAY IN THE AFTERNOON TO THE SHOW
PERHAPS YOU WIND UP IT IS AT LUNCHEON TIME THAT AS A PARTY WE SHOW TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
THE ANSWER IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE MEN
THERE IS A SET OF VERSES IN THE FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT WHICH LORD LARKSPUR WANTED TO--(_SHE WANDERS VAGUELY ROUND THE ROOM
WELL WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THIS
THE TRENCH SCENE WAS WRITTEN
COME ALONG DAHLIA BUT I SAY OLD CHAP PROTESTED SIMPSON
FORTUNATELY HE IS STOPPED IN TIME AND DRAGGED BACK TO HIS SEAT NEXT TO THE THRONE FROM WHICH HE RISES A MOMENT LATER TO OPEN THE PROCEEDING
AT TWENTY-STONE-SEVEN I LEFT IT
YOU WILL GIVE ORDERS THAT SUITABLE APARTMENTS ARE TO BE PREPARED YES FATHER
BUT COMMON KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY FOR THIS THAT HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT AND THAT THERE WAS MORE ARDUOUS WORK TO COME
THE SCENE OF MY STORY WAS LAID IN AN OLD CLAY HUT AMID THE WATTLES
AT 3.30 NEXT DAY WE WERE IN THE FATAL BUILDING
REALIZING AT ONCE THAT SHE MUST HAVE DROWNED HERSELF IN HER DISTRESS ANDREW TOOK AN AFFECTING FAREWELL OF HER FATHER AND THE SHEEP AND RETURNED TO LONDON
WAS IT ONLY A COINCIDENCE
A REAL BIRD AUTHORITY CAME TO TEA
AH ME
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT I MADE A LITTLE RHYME FOR HIM
IT IS THE DAY THAT I WATCH FOR YEARLY NEVER BEFORE HAS IT COME SO LATE
SORT OF A MAN'S HEAD I GAZED AT HER SADLY
THIS IS A BEASTLY WAR
PEOPLE WHO COME TO TEA BORROW A BOX OF WOODEN MATCHES AND BEG ME TO REMOVE ONE MATCH AND LEAVE A PERFECT SQUARE
CAN I AFFORD SO MUCH BUT YOU GAIN THE ACOUSTICS AND THE WAISTCOAT TRUE
YOU MAY FIND THE FIRST SECTION OF THIS BOOK--"ORANGES AND LEMONS"--A LITTLE DIFFICULT
THE STAGE CIGARETTE WHICH NOBODY EVER SEEMS TO WANT TO SMOKE TO THE END--THINKING OF THESE AS THEY MAKE THEIR APPEARANCES IN THE HOUSES OF THE TITLED ONE WOULD SAY THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THE PEERAGE WAS NOT A THING TO MAKE ANY GREAT RUSH FOR
I NEVER REALLY LONGED FOR GORE AND ANY TASTE FOR RED CORPUSCLES THAT LINGERED WITH ME LEFT BEFORE THE GERMAN TROOPS HAD ENTERED BRUSSELS
WELL SHE SAID AS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AT THE DOOR WE MUST HOPE FOR THE BEST
THE WEEKS THIS SUMMER--THINK
O ORANGE GROVES ALONG THE MIDDLE SEA
AT THE EIGHTEENTH TEE WE WERE ALL SQUARE AND HARDLY ON SPEAKING TERMS
AS YEARS WENT ON SUCH LOOKS WERE RARE
THE STAFF WAS ON THE LOGGIA WAITING TO GREET US
TOO SLEEPY FOR THE GOOD-NIGHT KISS HIS ONLY CONSCIOUS THOUGHT WAS THIS
NOW THEN HE SAID LOOKING UP
BEHOLD ME ON THE NIGHT THE LATEST WORD IN ALL THAT SEPARATES THE GENTLEMAN AND WAITERS FROM THE EVENING-DRESS-LESS MOB AND GRACED MOREOVER BY THE LATEST WORD IN WAISTCOATS SUCH AS MARK ONE FROM THE WAITERS
BUT IN THE FIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED HE PUT UP AN AMAZINGLY GOOD RESISTANCE
WHEN THE SLIDES OF VESUVIUS ARE THROWN UPON THE SCREEN CELIA WAS GOING PALE
IT GETS IN AT 3.37 AND I WALKED OVER FROM THE STATION
BY THE WAY WHAT SORT OF STUFF DO YOU BOWL ORDINARY SORT OF STUFF I SAID WITH ONE OR TWO BOUNCES IN IT
I HAVE AN UNEASY FEELING
IF HE LOST HIS BALL I WOULD BEG HIM TO DROP ANOTHER AND GO ON WITH THE HOLE
WAR-TIME O.B.E
I WILL PROCLAIM TO-MORROW A PUBLIC HOLIDAY AND GIVE ORDERS THAT IT BE CELEBRATED IN THE BATHS
UNTIL IT ARRIVES AT SOME WONDERLAND OF ITS OWN
BESIDES FOR ALL THE AUDIENCE KNOWS LORD JOHN MAY SIMPLY BE QUOTING
THEY HAD BEEN SCHOOLGIRLS TOGETHER
OF ALL THE UNJUST--WELL YOU SEE WHAT RECRIMINATIONS IT WOULD LEAD TO
THE UP-TO-DATE DRAMATIST MUST CERTAINLY AVOID THIS HALLMARK OF THE OLD-FASHIONED PLAY
HIS NEXT AT A VILLAGE BEHIND THE LINES WHERE HE MET STOUT FELLOWS OF D COMPANY AND TOOK THE CENTRE OF THE TABLE AT MESS IN THE APPLE ORCHARD
WE FIND THAT THE PUBLIC LIKES THESE CONTINUOUS BOOKS
TO ATTEMPT A RESCUE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS
IT'S PRACTICALLY ASKING A STRANGER FOR HOSPITALITY LET US SAY INDICATING OUR READINESS TO ACCEPT IT IT SOUNDS BETTER MYRA SMILED SLOWLY TO HERSELF
HE DASHED AT IT LIGHTHEARTEDLY AND MADE THE ANSWER SEVENTEEN
GOOD SHOT SAID SMITH WITH AN EFFORT
THERE IS A JAPANESE PROVINCE CALLED BINGO
IT'S MY HOUSE DAHLIA FOR THE TIME
THOMAS LOOKED SURPRISED GRUNTED AND ORDERED ANOTHER BREAKFAST
IN A ROOM FULL OF SMOKE HE PERCEIVED A COWERING WOMAN
THE VIEW OF CORSICA WAS TO BE OBTAINED FROM A POINT SOME MILES UP--TOO FAR TO GO BEFORE LUNCH
I HAVE WRITTEN NO MORE HE SAYS IN A DEEP VOICE
I WENT INTO THE SHOP TO BUY A GRAMOPHONE RECORD AND I CAME OUT WITH A PIANOLA--SO GOLDEN-TONGUED WAS THE MANAGER
AT LAST A SUDDEN SHRIEK
MY HAPPY HOME MY FAITH IN EXPERTS FIGURES HALF MY MONEY THE FORTNIGHT THAT I MEANT TO SPEND IN ROME MY WEEKLY EFFORT TO BE FAIRLY FUNNY
BY JOVE HE CRIED THE SECRET DOCUMENT
THEY WERE AS MUCH ALONE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN AT THE NATIONAL GALLERY TOGETHER
IN ANY OTHER COMPANY CERTAINLY
IT'S WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A PIED DE TERRE IN TOWN
IT WAS ON A FAIR SPRING MORNING JUST A WEEK AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL THAT THE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT CAME INTO THE MUSIC-ROOM WHERE ALGERNON WAS HUMMING A TUNE AND SAID AH ALGERNON MY HUSBAND WAS LOOKING FOR YOU
IT ENDED THE TRENCH SCENE
AND JUST FOR PRACTICE SHE TOOK THE TWO STARS OFF MY OTHER TUNIC AND SEWED THEM ON THIS ONE--THUS
AND IN OUR CASE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ABSENCE FROM THE PIANOLA DID NOT MAKE THE HEART GROW FONDER
PRINCESS AMARIL SIGHED
D COMPANY HAS A REPUTATION ALL I SAY SAID ROGERS IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T RUN ANY MESS IN THE TRENCHES ON FOUR FRANCS A DAY YOU'RE A ROTTEN MESS PRESIDENT BLAKE TURNED DRAMATICALLY TO HIS COMPANY COMMANDER
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE WAS SILENCE WHILE THEY BROODED OVER THE TRAGIC NEWS
YES--ER--YES HE WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS BROW
PERHAPS SAID THE COUNTESS AT LAST THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
I'VE A BEAUTIFUL SWING THAT I LEARNT FROM VARDON I PRACTISE IT SOMETIMES DOWN THE GARDEN MY FAULT
MON AMI IT N'EST PAS_--I SAY THOMAS OLD CHAP WHERE ARE YOU
WHERE WE ALL ASKED BLANKLY
IT'S SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLATOONS THAT I FORGET
I KNOW
A NOTE
WHY SHOULD THEY TALK TO US AS IF WE WERE CHILDREN
AND ON THE FOURTH DAY I WALKED BOLDLY IN
CELIA YOU DO DODGE ABOUT SO
TAKING UP A PEN HE PRINTED ON THE OUTSIDE IN LARGE CAPITALS THESE WORDS
HE ONLY MURMURED ROSAMUND WHO WAS PRIVATE SMITHLORD
BUT OF COURSE HE SAID ONE MUST READ IT IN THE ORIGINAL FRENCH
AND BLAKE I SAID AFTER HE'D TOLD ME SOME OF IT THAT NICE CHILD IN D COMPANY
THE JOKE
JUST A REMINDER THAT MR T.P
PROBABLY HE WILL LEARN SOMETHING QUIETER--LIKE PAINTING
THE ENGRAVED RING ARRIVED AS WE WERE AT TEA A FEW DAYS LATER AND I HAD A SUDDEN OVERWHELMING FEAR THAT CELIA WOULD NOT BE PLEASED
STOPES STOPES SAID CELIA
A CURIOUS FOREBODING OF EVIL CAME OVER ME AS I PLACED THOSE WATTLES TENDERLY ALONG THE WEST BANK OF THE PIAVE
BUT WHEN IT WAS JOINED UP TO THE TELEPHONE IN THE FRONT LINE THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS CALLED UPON TO BE NOT ONLY A PERSONAL MASCOT BUT A MASCOT TO THE BATTALION AND HE SAT HIMSELF UPON THE TELEPHONE AND CALLED DOWN A BLESSING ON THAT CABLE SO THAT IT REMAINED WHOLE FOR TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT WHEN BY ALL THE RULES IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN A THOUSAND PIECES
AND THEN WHEN THE HAIRDRESSER--WHEN YOUR FRIENDS AT THE CLUB ASK IF YOU'VE HAD ANY LUCK AT THE TABLES YOU JUST SAY COLDLY WHAT TABLES PREFERABLY IN LATIN SAID ARCHIE
HIS LINE IS THE ACTUAL MANIPULATION OF THE PIANOFORTE--THE PADEREWSKI TOUCH
IT GOES LIKE THIS AND SHE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN IT
WE NEVER HAVE ANY NEVER HAVE ANY SAID BLAKE INDIGNANTLY
WHEN DO YOU GO BACK TO DEVONSHIRE HE ASKED
SUMMER DAYS IV
JESSIE WAS PROSTRATED WITH GRIEF
OF COURSE I QUITE SEE THAT
BUT FIRST TO LOCK THE DOOR LEST I SHOULD BE INTERRUPTED BY HAROLD WOTNOTT IN THE MODERN WELL-CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO
EPILOGUE HAVING READ THUS FAR CELIA SAYS BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T GOT THE JOKE IN OH WELL HERE GOES
I ARRIVED EXHAUSTED AND WITH ONLY JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO KNEEL DOWN AND PRESS MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE LARGE BLOCK OF ICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP ROUND WHICH THE LOBSTERS NESTLED
A IS PLAYING B
HALLO SHE LOOKED UP FROM HER BOOK AND WAVED HER HAND
I LOVE YOU I REPEATED MECHANICALLY
HE TRIPPED OFF TO THE ESTAMINET
VERY WELL SIR NO NOT THE MOTHER
MY FRIEND HAS DRUNK ALL THIS GASPARD REMOVED THE WINE FROM HIS WHISKERS WITH JACQUES PAPER AND LEANT OVER HIM
BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD THE TUFTED PIPIT YET
A LONG WAY ON I SAID REPROACHFULLY
WHAT IS IT WELL SHE SAID HER CHEEKS PERHAPS A LITTLE PINKER THAN USUAL I WAS JUST THINKING THAT LIFE WAS VERY WONDERFUL
SO AFTER MY TENTH YES I ADDED QUITE CASUALLY
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT LIED THE EARNEST-LOOKING GIRL
YET AT THE FIRST LITTLE DROP OF WATER FROM ABOVE JOHNNY'S FATHER MUST BREAK OUT INTO VIOLENT ABUSE OF ME
LET US ASSUME THAT LORD ARTHUR ASKS LORD JOHN WHAT A CYNIC IS--THE QUESTION OF WHAT A CYNIC IS HAVING ARISEN QUITE NATURALLY IN THE COURSE OF THE PLOT
WE HAD GONE NORTH TO A MORE GENTLEMANLY PART OF THE LINE AND HIS DUTIES TOOK BUT LITTLE OF HIS TIME SO THAT ANYTHING NOVEL LIKE A PAIR OF PLIERS OR AN ORDER FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ARMY SIGNALS WAS ALWAYS WELCOME
BUT THE PAPERS SHE CRIED
IN THE SMALL SPACE ALLOTTED TO HIM THE SCULPTOR HAS HARDLY DONE ME JUSTICE
WELL CELIA SAID OUR HOST HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STAY WITH US OH A LONG TIME YET SAID CELIA CONFIDENTLY
ELEVEN SHE CRIED
MANNERING IS SOMETHING IN THE TERRITORIALS WHEN HE IS NOT LOOKING AFTER HIS ESTATE
HOWEVER I DECIDED TO KNOW THE WORST
AND SO THE BRISTLES CAME AND REMAINED UNTIL THE HAPPY DAY WHEN THE WAR OFFICE AT THE RISK OF LOSING THE WAR MADE THEM OPTIONAL
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM
AND I'VE GOT TO TELL HIM
IF THE DAYS WERE REALLY HOT COULD HE WEAR ONE WOOLLY SPOT
TEN YEARS AGO LORD BLIGHT HAD BEEN PLAIN JOHN BLIGHTER WITH NO PROSPECTS IN FRONT OF HIM
YOU'RE AN UNGRATEFUL WIFE I SAID AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE I TOOK
OTHERWISE RURITANIA MIGHT AS WELL CEASE TO BE A SOVEREIGN STATE FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HER PRESTIGE IN THE EYES OF EUROPE AND SINK TO THE LEVEL OF A FIFTH-RATE POWER
I MAKE IT ELEVEN--OUR ELEVEN CHILDREN THAN I AM BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FATHER AND MOTHER WANT TO BE ALONE I'M SORRY DEAR
THEY SEEMED VERY LONELY
ISN'T HE A DARLING LITTLE CRAB
THEN ASKING THE COMPANY TO WATCH YOU CAREFULLY YOU--YOU TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE FORGOTTEN JUST WHAT IT IS YOU DO DO BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS A VERY GOOD TRICK AND NEVER FAILS TO CREATE LAUGHTER AND BEWILDERMENT
BLIGHT SHE WHISPERED
RELUCTANTLY BLANCHAILLE AGREED
GOADED TO ANGER HE HAD PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND MADE THE GENERAL OBSERVATION RICE-PUDDING"--AN OBSERVATION INOFFENSIVE ENOUGH TO A STRANGER BUT EVIDENTLY OF SUCH DEEP PRIVATE SIGNIFICANCE TO PHYLLIS THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HIM TO HEAD A PURSUIT INTO THE SHRUBBERY WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
I S'POSE I THORT THE WAR WOULD STOP
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS LIFE MY PIANOLA REFUSED TO PLAY THE CHARGE OF THE UHLANS IT HAD PLAYED IT A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE THE WAR BUT NOW--NO
TUPTO TUPTOMAI THE SERBS FOR REASONS INTO WHICH I NEED NOT ENTER WERE INARTICULATE WITH RAGE
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY THAT I HAVE GENIUS IT IS FOR ME TO SAY IT DEAR SAID HIS WIFE
THE INTUITION AND READY WIT OF THE WOMAN PIERCED THE DISGUISE WHICH HAD BAFFLED THE SOLDIER
FOR IN ORDER THAT NO MELANCHOLY ASSOCIATIONS SHOULD CAST A GLOOM OVER THEIR LITTLE OUTINGS HE TOOK CARE TO VISIT A DIFFERENT HEALTH-RESORT EACH TIME FEELING THAT NO EXPENSE OR TROUBLE SHOULD BE SPARED IN A MATTER OF THIS KIND
2ND LIEUT
OR PERHAPS THE GIRL WITH THE MERINGUE IN HER HAIR DIDN'T GET IT QUITE RIGHT
STILL LESS DUKE THROWING AWAY END OF CIGARETTE SHOW HIM IN FOR THIS MUST REMAIN ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF THE STAGE--WHAT HAPPENS TO THE STAGE CIGARETTE WHEN IT HAS BEEN PUFFED FOUR TIMES
IS THE CAUDAL AFFIX OF THE RODENT THY APOLOGY FOR IT AND BINGO WOULD WHIMPER WITH SHAME
ROSAMUND HE BREATHED AND WITH A SMILE OF CONTENT DROPPED PEACEFULLY ASLEEP AGAIN
AND AT THE FULL HEIGHT OF ONE'S POWERS TO BE BAULKED BY THE MORBIDITY FOR I CAN CALL IT NOTHING ELSE OF A PERCY PODBY
ONE HAS ONE'S ART ONE'S MEDIUM OF EXPRESSION
WE SELECTED A NICE ONE BETWEEN US AND HE WRAPPED A PIECE OF DAILY MAIL ROUND IT LEAVING ONLY THE WHISKERS VISIBLE AND GAVE IT TO ME
HE WRAPPED A PIECE OF DAILY NEWS ROUND IT AND GAVE IT TO ME
BUT THEN HE NEVER HAD A LETTER-BOX WHICH WENT FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY FLIPPERTY--FLOP HEAVY WORK EVERY NOW AND THEN DOCTORS SLAP ME ABOUT AND ASK ME IF I WAS ALWAYS AS THIN AS THIS
WITH A DOG I ADDED
I WAS TELLING HER ABOUT OUR CAT IMPORTED INTO OUR DUG-OUT IN THE HOPE THAT IT WOULD KEEP THE RATS DOWN WHEN SUDDENLY THE JOKE CAME
WHAT ARE WATTLES ASKED CELIA WHEN I TOLD HER THE GOOD NEWS
THOUGH WHAT THEY DO OR WHAT LEAVE UNDONE I OFTEN ASK AND ASK IN VAIN
I DO SO WITH PLEASURE
HE BEGAN BY PUSHING THREE COUSINS OVER THE CLIFFS AT SCARBOROUGH THUS BECOMING SECOND HEIR TO THE EARLDOM
THE ANSWER TO THIS WILL DEPEND UPON THE LENGTH OF THE PLAY FOR UPON THE LENGTH DEPENDS THE HOUR AT WHICH THE CURTAIN RISES
THE CHANCELLOR OF ESSENLAND IN A SPEECH GRAVELY APPLAUDED BY BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE ANNOUNCED THE STEPS HE HAD TAKEN
HOWEVER HE CAN'T THINK OF IT FOR THE MOMENT SO HE TRIES SOMETHING ELSE
AH THAT'S RIGHT
HE CAN'T EVEN LOOK OUT OF A FIRST-FLOOR WINDOW
LETTERS--THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ASKING US WE SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO COME AND THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US WE ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY WITH THESE OFF MY MIND I COULD REALLY CONCENTRATE ON MY WORK OR MY SHORT MASHIE SHOTS OR WHATEVER WAS OF IMPORTANCE
YOU WISHED TO SEE ME COLONEL I DID MAJOR THEY SALUTED EACH OTHER AGAIN
THIS IS NO TIME FOR ICHABODS AND EHEU_--ER--_FUGACES AH NO
HE PLACED THE CASE THEREFORE PROMINENTLY ON A SMALL TABLE IN THE DINING-ROOM TO AWAIT THE OCCASION
AH BUT YOU DON'T GET IT THERE
AT THE END OF IT JACQUES RISSOLE HAD ONLY ONE HOPE
I INVITE YOU HE THREW OUT HIS HANDS IN A LARGE GESTURE OF WELCOME AND KNOCKED HIS COFFEE-CUP ON TO THE CARPET
MY DEAR THE SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT CARRYING A SACK
IN A MATCH LAST SEPTEMBER I WENT ON TO BOWL WHY I KNEW THE CAPTAIN I EXPLAINED
THAT'LL BE ANOTHER SISTER I EXPECT
AT LAST I HAD PUT ON FLESH
YOU'LL HAVE SOME TEA WON'T YOU
OF COURSE ON THE ACTUAL NIGHT THE MATCH MAY REFUSE TO STRIKE AND LORD JOHN MAY HAVE TO GO ON SAYING A MAN WHO--A MAN WHO--A MAN WHO UNTIL THE IGNITION OCCURS BUT EVEN SO IT WILL STILL SEEM DELIGHTFULLY NATURAL TO THE AUDIENCE AS IF HE WERE MAKING UP THE EPIGRAM AS HE WENT ALONG
SHE STOPS IN SURPRISE AT SEEING LORD ARTHUR AND HOLDS OUT HER HAND
GRADUALLY HE GOT THE UPPER HAND
IT WAS WONDERFUL WITH WHAT VIGOUR AND ALERTNESS OF MIND HE SAT DOWN IN THE EVENINGS TO THE PREPARATION OF HIS SPEECH ON THE COAST EROSION BILL
E TALKS OF PUNCTURED DAMN-THE-THINGS
THEN I AM A LIEUTENANT I SAID
HOWEVER I ASSUME THAT YOU WHO READ THIS ARE ACTUALLY IN NEED OF THE DIBS
WHAT SHOULD THIS NOVEL OF HENRY'S BE ABOUT
SO GLAD YOU COULD COME
I FOR IDIOT I ADDED QUICKLY
YET I MUST CONFESS THAT THERE ARE TIMES NOW WHEN I FEEL THAT PERHAPS AFTER ALL I MAY HAVE OVERRATED IT
IN DRAWING-ROOMS I AM SOMETIMES CALLED CAPTAIN-ER
TO START LIFE WITH SO MANY FLIPPERTIES MIGHT LEAD TO ANYTHING
I CONTINUED TO PUT ON MORE OUNCES
THEN TURNING TO MYRA YOU SAY MR MANNERING'S SISTER
IS IT THE THOUGHT OF GRANTA ONCE OUR DAUGHTER THE FRESHERS MATCH THE SECOND IN OUR MAYS THAT MAKES OUR MOUTH OUR VERY SOUL TO WATER
O'CONNOR HAS TO PASS THIS BEFORE IT CAN BE PRODUCED_.]--HE MARRIED HER MANAGER
THEY WERE ALL BUSY ADMIRING ME
OH SAMUEL SIGHED MYRA AND I PROMISED YOUR AUNT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T GAMBLE WHILE YOU WERE AWAY BUT MY DEAR MYRA IT'S THE FIRST THING THE FELLOWS AT THE CLUB ASK YOU WHEN YOU'VE BEEN TO THE RIVIERA--IF YOU'VE HAD ANY LUCK WELL YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF LUCK SAID ARCHIE
DUTY THOMAS DUTY HE SAID THUMPING HIS CHEST
STILL THE BAR STAYED AT THE TOP
ALOUD I SAID WHAT IN THE HOPE OF GAINING A LITTLE MORE TIME
WASPS AND THEIR YOUNG LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE THE BLANKTOWN LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY TUESDAY DECEMBER 8TH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WELL SAID CELIA DRIFTING IN HOW'S IT GOING I SHOWED HER HOW FAR I HAD GOT
ONE NATURALLY ASSUMES THAT
WELL SAID THE SQUIRE WITH A HEARTY LAUGH IT'S TIME FOR BED ONE BY ONE THEY FILED OFF SAYING WHAT A DELIGHTFUL EVENING THEY HAD HAD
THOSE HAD BEEN WEEKS OF MINGLED HOPE AND DESPAIR
AND THEN HE BEGAN TO GET NERVOUS
THE BOMBING OFFICER I REMEMBER VOWED THAT MRS BLAKE'S HOSPITALITY WAS SO CHARMING THAT HE WOULD BRING HIS WIFE AND FAMILY NEXT TIME
THEY BELIEVE--THEY HAVE MY AUTHORITY FOR BELIEVING--THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM A DISABILITY OF THE EYESIGHT LAID UPON THEM BY A WICKED ENCHANTER UNDER WHICH THEY SEE PRINCES AS--ER--PIGS
RIGHT MYRA I SEE
WE MUST SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE ITALIAN FRONT BUT I HAD VERY LITTLE HOPE
THE CHARACTERS OF IT ARE OLD FRIENDS TO THAT LIMITED PUBLIC WHICH READS MY BOOKS IN ENGLAND
DO NOT THINK THAT I WANT YOU TO HURT HIM
BLAKE D.S.O BRIG.-GEN I HAD BEEN OUT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN QUITE ACCIDENTALLY I MET AN OFFICER OF THE BATTALION IN LONDON I WAS NEARLY A YEAR BEHIND THE NEWS
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME I HAVE THESE SURPRISING INTUITIONS I SAID MODESTLY
IT WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR ONE TABLE
WELL I WASN'T GOING TO WASTE MY WATTLES
THE WORLD WE FEEL IS A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR A YOUNG WOMAN WITH MONEY
NOT IF YOU GET A GOOD TAKE-OFF DAHLIA SAID SIMPSON EARNESTLY
HALLO DAHLIA
IT WAS A CHANCE NOT TO BE MISSED
RIGHT OFF THE BOARD SAID THOMAS
THE KING LOOKED AT HER SUSPICIOUSLY AND THEN LOOKED AWAY AGAIN PULLING AT HIS BEARD
HOW DELIGHTFUL SAYS EVERYBODY
YOUR NATURAL INSTINCT WILL BE TO SAY EXEUNT FLUFFINOSE AND LADY LARKSPUR R
I WASN'T GETTING ON VERY FAST BECAUSE WHENEVER I SUGGESTED A SCENE TO HIM HE EITHER SAID OH THAT'S BEEN DONE WHICH KILLED IT OR ELSE HE SAID OH BUT THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE WHICH KILLED IT EVEN MORE COMPLETELY
LET US BE THANKFUL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PLAY AGAINST GIRLS SCHOOLS
WHO KNEW A MAN WHO KNEW A MAN WHO KNEW ME
AND SO BEGAN TO PLAY GOD SAVE THE KING AGAIN
AND ONE ON THE LEFT SHOULDER
AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU
INDEED THAT IS THE WAY WE GET TO IT FOR IT IS A CASTLE IN THE AIR
NOW THEN--WAIT A BIT--OH YES I'VE GOT IT
ANYHOW IT WAS A LIE AS SO MUCH GOOD POETRY IS
WHAT HAS HAPPENED HE LOOKED UP HAGGARDLY
AND AFTER LUNCH WE TAKE A STROLL IN THE GARDEN AND TO OUR GREAT SURPRISE DISCOVER THOMAS
WE PRESUME THEY HAVE ALL BEEN INVITED
AT LEAST I SUPPOSE HE DID FOR CELIA REPEATED HER NAME AND MINE VERY SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY
IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR THAT
SORRY
SORRY
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY DISCOVERED THE CORRECT ROUTE
INDEED HE FELT SO UNWELL THAT THE NEED FOR SOME SLIGHT RESTORATIVE BECAME PRESSING
I SHALL SEND MY RESIGNATION IN TO THE ARMY COUNCIL TO-NIGHT
BY THE WAY THE DOCTOR TALKS ABOUT PUTTING ON FLESH BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HOW MUCH HE WANTED
IN MY SECOND DRAFT REALIZING THE DANGERS OF DELAY I BEGAN AT ONCE THIS REMARKABLE NOVEL AND CONTINUED SO FOR A COUPLE OF SENTENCES
REMIND ME AFTER THE CEREMONY TO SPEAK TO THE LORD TREASURER ABOUT THE MATTER SAY NO MORE BEGGED HI-YOU
ONE NIGHT AFTER DINNER WHEN ALL THE PODBY FAMILY BASIL AND PERCY HAD RETIRED TO BED GERTIE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT CAME INTO HER HUSBAND'S LIBRARY AND TWIRLING THE REVOLVING BOOKCASE WITH RESTLESS FINGERS ASKED IF SHE COULD INTERRUPT HIM FOR A MOMENT
HAVE YOU FINISHED ASKED OUR HOST
NEXT MORNING HE FOUND IT ON HIS DRESSING-TABLE
I HADN'T SEEN HER FOR SOME TIME AND THERE WERE PLENTY IN THE PLATE IF YOU ARE COMING TO TALK TO ME SHE SAID I THINK I HAD BETTER WARN YOU THAT I AM A BOLSHEVIST THEN YOU WON'T WANT A SANDWICH I SAID GLADLY AND I WITHDREW THE PLATE
NOW MY EXPENSE ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH WITH A NIGHT AT AN HOTEL WILL BE AT LEAST FIVE POUNDS FIVE-POUNDS-TEN PROFIT SAID CELIA
WRITE A LITTLE LETTER INSTEAD WELL AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST JUST WRITE A NOTE TO THE LAUNDRESS TO THE LAUNDRESS I SAID
BUT EVEN NOW BEGAN THE VERY YOUNG GOD DOUBTFULLY
ENTER BINGO BEFORE I INTRODUCE BINGO I MUST SAY A WORD FOR HUMPHREY HIS SPARRING PARTNER
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER TO HAVE HAD A LION WHICH MEANS--ER--LIONS BUT I WAS DETERMINED NOT TO SPARE MYSELF
AND THERE I ADDED IS HIS INITIAL R OH WOMAN THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT I SPENT ON THAT RING SHE CAME A LITTLE CLOSER AND SLIPPED THE RING ON MY FINGER
LET US ASSUME FURTHER THAT YOU WISH LORD JOHN TO REPLY A CYNIC IS A MAN WHO KNOWS THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING AND THE VALUE OF NOTHING IT HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT YOU MAY FEEL THAT IT IS QUITE TIME IT WAS SAID AGAIN
PERHAPS--IN ANOTHER THREE YEARS HE SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKS GLOOMINGLY OUT
THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HIM
ALSO HE ADDED WITH SOME HEAT I FEEL STRONGLY THAT WHAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR PERCY'S FATHER TEN BROTHERS THREE HALF-BROTHERS NOT TO MENTION HIS COUSIN SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PERCY THE COUNTESS OF BLIGHT MOVED SADLY FROM THE ROOM
MY DEAR OLD CHAP I KNOW IT FOR A FACT
I HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT
PERHAPS IN TIME--A LITTLE HIGHER EVERY DAY THE EARL SIGHED AGAIN
WE CLIMBED UP A STEEP PATH WHICH LED TO THE ROCK-VILLAGE ABOVE US
I GAVE HIM ALL THE INFORMATION HE WANTED AND MORE
I TOOK MY HAT AND STAGGERED OUT
JELLICOE"--THESE BY ALL MEANS
A GROUP TAKE THE HOUSE AND THE GARDEN AND THE VILLAGE SAID THOMAS
AND BINGO HIMSELF MUST HAVE FELT THIS
I BELIEVE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO COULD BE CERTAIN OF TWO YEARS I WENT ON MUSINGLY
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK UNLESS I FIND MY BALL BEFORE I SHALL BE PLAYING THE LIKE
BUT ANYHOW THAT WAS THE IDEA OF IT
SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A CRAB SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN DOING HIS BEST WITH IT
THE WORLD WILL NEVER HEAR THE JOKE NOW
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
WHO ARE YOU ASKED MR BELLINGHAM
I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE A FEW DAYS BEFORE IT'S OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED I SAID
SO FAR I HAVE BEEN WRITING AS IF YOU WERE ALREADY IN THE THICK OF YOUR PLAY
WHETHER HE FOUND ME EXACTLY LIKE ANYBODY ELSE IN CANADA I DON'T KNOW
IT'S THE RIVIERA ARCHIE SAT DOWN AGAIN
WE MEET--IN SIX MONTHS GOOD JACQUES POINTED TO THE CEILING
AFTER ALL DID FISHMONGERS SELL ICE
THINK OF SLIDING HOME ON IT WELL OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE DONE
HO LOR IT ISN'T A DREAM IT'S JUST AS IT USED TO BE EVERY BIT
HO LOR IT ISN'T A DREAM IT'S JUST AS IT USED TO BE EVERY BIT
IT IS MERELY SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES WHICH ANNOYS ME
AFTER GIVING THE MATTER EVERY CONSIDERATION I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ONLY WAY TO WIN MY SECOND STAR WAS TO SAVE THE COLONEL'S LIFE
DON'T THINK THAT I SHALL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN READING THE BOOK
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN ROSE
CERTAINLY
THINK HOW OFFENDED DUKE BARLOW WOULD BE IF WE PUT BARLOW ESQ ON THE ENVELOPE WE COULD TELEGRAPH
I SPEAK OF HATS OFF PLEASE CH
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A HUSBAND MAY LEGITIMATELY BE ANNOYED
AND SO ON FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
THERE ARE I UNDERSTAND A FEW AMERICANS WHO READ PUNCH AND IT WAS SUGGESTED TO ME THAT A SUITABLE COLLECTION OF ARTICLES FROM THESE THREE BOOKS MIGHT HAVE SOME SORT OF AMERICAN SALE
YOU WILL NEVER BE A DRAMATIST UNTIL YOU HAVE LEARNT THE TECHNIQUE OF MEALS IN SPITE OF ALL YOU CAN DO IN THE WAY OF AVOIDING SOILILOQUIES AND GETTING YOUR CHARACTERS ON AND OFF THE STAGE IN A DRAMATIC MANNER A TIME WILL COME WHEN YOU REALIZE SADLY THAT YOUR PLAY IS NOT A BIT LIKE LIFE AFTER ALL
IF THE CARDEWS ARE GOING TO BE NICE WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE DAHLIA AND ALL OF THEM OUT OF IT I THOUGHT IT OVER CAREFULLY FOR A LITTLE
A BOOK-CASE WOULD BE MUCH PRETTIER THERE BUT NOT SO TUNEFUL A PIANOLA ISN'T TUNEFUL IF YOU NEVER PLAY IT TRUE I SAID
NO I SAID TO MYSELF I'M ON THE WRONG TACK SO I BEGAN AGAIN SOME YORKSHIRE POT-HOLES LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE THE BLANKTOWN LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY TUESDAY DECEMBER 8TH
HIS FACE WORE A SLIGHTLY WORRIED EXPRESSION
THEIR EARLIER ADVENTURES HAVE BEEN TOLD IN THOSE PREVIOUS VOLUMES AND PURPOSELY OMITTED FROM HAPPY DAYS AS BEING A LITTLE TOO INSULAR I FEEL SOMEHOW THAT STRANGERS WILL NOT BE ON SUCH EASY TERMS WITH THEM AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPROACH THEM LAST
THE LATE CHAMPION GOODWOOD LO WAS NO MORE
I FORGET HOW MANY BAYONETS WE HAVE ON THE WESTERN FRONT BUT THERE MUST BE AT LEAST TWICE AS MANY FOUNTAIN-PENS IT NEEDN'T BE ABOUT THE WESTERN FRONT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE ONLY FRONT I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT I THOUGHT WRITERS USED THEIR IMAGINATION SOMETIMES SAID CELIA TO ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE LISTENING
COATS AND HATS FELL TO THE GROUND
IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR YEARS THEN WE--OH LET'S HAVE LUNCH SHE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO UNDO THE SANDWICHES
AND UP AT THE FORT THE OTHER DAY A SENTRY OF THE ROYAL DEFENCE CORPS WEARING THE CRECY MEDAL MISTOOK ME FOR A MAJOR AND PRESENTED CROSSBOWS TO ME
BUT THINK WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY IT GIVES ME
IT IS ON THESE DAYS THAT WE TRAVEL TO OUR CASTLE OF STOPES
THE CROUPIER WITH HIS RAKE PUSHED THE MONEY ON TO SEVENTEEN
EVERYTHING WILL BE AT A STANDSTILL DIRECTLY HER COMPANION WENT ON
BUT SOMEHOW NOT PRINCES 4 SIMPSON HAD DONE THE SHORT THIRD HOLE AT MT
AND FINALLY I SAID AND THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE WHOLE TROUBLE THAT ANTOINE VAURELLE'S WORLD-FAMOUS CLASSIC--AND I LOOKED IT UP IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA--WORLD-RENOWNED CLASSIC JE COMPRENDS TOUT HAD BEEN NOT WITHOUT ITS INFLUENCE ON MR BLANK
JOHNNY LIVES IN THE FLAT BELOW AND I HEAR HIM TOUCHING
BINGO AT THAT TIME STILL UNCERTAIN OF HIS DESTINY HAD AT LEAST THE COURAGE OF THE LION
A TELEPHONE LINE HAD TO BE LAID AND FOR REASONS OBVIOUS TO COMMON RATHER RAPIDLY
THERE MIGHT EASILY BE RATS IN A VICARAGE NOT IN THIS ONE YOU TALK ABOUT POOR AS A CHURCH MOUSE I AM AN ARTIST I SAID THUMPING MY HEART AND FOREHEAD AND OTHER SEATS OF THE EMOTIONS
THEY HAVE VERY MUCH THE SAME NOTE DURING THE BREEDING SEASON
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE DOVES COOING ROUND OUR GERANIUMS AREN'T DOVE-COTS VERY BIG FOR A WINDOW-BOX WE COULD GET A SMALL ONE--FOR SMALL DOVES
DID HE I WONDER HE AND MRS PHIPP TALK ART AND POLITICS AT GRINDELWALD OR DID ONE SIMPLY POINT HIM OUT TO HER WITH THAT IS MR BROWNIE WERE THEY FRIENDS DEAR FRIENDS OR CASUAL ACQUAINTANCES
WE LEAVE THAT TO HER
BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE TO SO DISTINGUISHED A VISITOR
SHE WEARS THE FASHIONABLE COSTUME DE PLAGE WHICH CONSISTS OF A WHITE LINEN HAT A JERSEY AND AN OVERCROWDED PAIR OF BATHING-DRAWERS INTO WHICH NOT ONLY JENNY BUT THE REST OF HER WARDROBE HAS HAD TO FIT ITSELF
THE RECORD OF IT I SHALL BE GLAD TO SEE PETER AGAIN SAID DAHLIA AS SHE FOLDED UP HER LETTER FROM HOME
OH YES CAMELS
AND THE GREAT DUST-UP BEGINS
BULGARIA HAS SURRENDERED CELIA MAY BE A GOOD PATRIOT BUT SHE LACKS THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT
JUST FOR A MOMENT HE HESITATED
ROSE THE FLOWER--OR THE SISTER IF YOU LIKE
BUT HOW--THAT'S THE QUESTION
MARY
IF HE CARES TO PROSECUTE ERNEST MERROWBY WOOLMAN FOR BEING IN POSSESSION OF STOLEN GOODS I SHALL BE GLAD TO GIVE HIM ANY INFORMATION
WHAT WOULD NOT HINDENBURG GIVE TO SEE IT HE MUTTERED
THIS IS ALL HE SAYS DURING THE PLAY SO HE MUST TRY AND GET A LITTLE CHARACTER INTO IT IN ORDER THAT THE ERA MAY REMARK MR THOMPSON WAS EXCELLENT AS MATTHEWS HOWEVER HIS PART IS NOT OVER YET FOR HE RETURNS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THREE FOOTMEN--JUST AS IT HAPPENED WHEN YOU LAST CALLED ON THE DUCHESS--_AND SETS OUT THE TEA HOSTESS HOLDING UP THE PROPERTY LUMP OF SUGAR IN THE TONGS
IF ONE IS TO BE CALLED A LIAR ONE MAY AS WELL MAKE AN EFFORT TO DESERVE THE NAME
FOR MY LAST TRICK HE WILL ALSO REQUIRE A CERTAIN APTITUDE FOR LEGERDEMAIN IN ORDER TO DO IT
THAT WHEN YOU HAVE GOT HOLD OF WHAT YOU FEEL IS A REALLY POWERFUL IDEA YOU FIND SUDDENLY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN FORESTALLED BY SOME EARLIER WRITER--SOPHOCLES OR SHAKESPEARE OR GEORGE R
HE IS A SMALL YELLOW DOG WITH GLASS OPTICS AND THE LABEL ROUND HIS NECK SAID HIS EYES MOVE WHEN I HAD FINISHED THE ORANGES AND SWEETS AND NUTS WHEN CELIA AND I HAD PULLED THE CRACKERS HUMPHREY REMAINED OVER TO SIT ON THE MUSIC-STOOL WITH THE AIR OF ONE PLAYING THE PIANOLA
HERBERT EXPLAINED HASTILY THAT HE HADN'T REALLY BEGUN YET AND WITH THE AID OF AN ANECDOTE ABOUT A COUSIN OF HIS WHO HAD MET WINSTON CHURCHILL AT DIEPPE ONCE HE MANAGED TO GET THE IN SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE BLOWING HIS NOSE VIGOROUSLY AND ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD FINISHED
I AM ASKED TO DO ABSURD THINGS WITH PENNIES
PRODUCED BY RICK NILES AND JOHN HAGERSON MARY MEEHAN AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM
YOU'VE HAD COFFEE HAVEN'T YOU ARCHIE BETTER HAVE SOME MORE I SUGGESTED IN CASE SIMPSON IS MERELY SOPORIFIC
I WANT TO SEE I LOOKED ROUND FOR HER MOTHER
OF COURSE JUST A NOTE WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN I INSISTED ON HER COMING WITH ME TO POST IT
I WOUND THE ROLL OFF PUT IT IN AGAIN AND TRIED A SECOND TIME PEDALLING VIGOROUSLY
CARPE DIEM_--YES THAT'S THE MOTTO WORK BE JIGGERED AND LIKEWISE WHAT HO I'M NOT GOING BACK TILL I'VE JOLLY WELL GOT TO
WELL I NEVER
SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO HAVE BROUGHT WITH US ALL ALONG MORE MONEY SAID MYRA
THE LEGEND OF HI-YOU I IN THE DAYS OF GOOD KING CARRAWAY DEAD NOW POOR FELLOW BUT HE HAD A PLEASANT TIME WHILE HE LASTED THERE LIVED A CERTAIN SWINEHERD COMMONLY CALLED HI-YOU
IV I SHOULD LIKE TO DWELL UPON THE WEEKS WHICH FOLLOWED
YES IT WILL BE IN A MONTH OR LESS WHEN ALL THE FLOWERS IN THE WORLD ARE BLOOMING AND NATURE FLUTTERS HER FAIREST DRESS THEN I MY FRIENDS I TOO SHALL WEAR A BLAZER THAT WILL MAKE THEM STARE AND BRUSH--THIS IS OFFICIAL
BUT AT ANY RATE IT IS THE LAST OF THIS SORT OF BOOK
NICE COOL ICE
WE CAN ALWAYS USE IT AGAIN ON VISITORS
IT TAKES US BY THE EAR AND LUGS US FIRMLY DOWN DIFFERENT PATHS TOWARDS ONE COMMON GOAL PATHS PRE-APPOINTED NOT OF OUR OWN CHOOSING
LANCELOT AND HERBERT WHO HAD INHERITED THE PODBY INTELLECT WERE ENCOURAGED TO BROWSE AROUND THE REVOLVING BOOKCASE FROM WHICH THEY FREQUENTLY EXTRACTED ONE OF THE WORKS OF THACKERAY REPLACING IT AGAIN AFTER A GLANCE AT THE TITLE PAGE
SUNDAY A MONTH AGO WAS HOT
DAHLIA SHOULD HAVE HAD AN ORANGE IN HER HAND AND MYRA MIGHT HAVE BEEN RESTING HER CHEEK AGAINST A CACTUS
CAPTAIN BOLSOVER A SMART CAVALRY OFFICER TOGETHER WITH PROFESSOR AND MRS SMITH-SMYTHE FROM OXFORD FORMED A SMALL PARTY IN ANOTHER CORNER
HE PUTS HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND OBSERVING IN THE DISTANCE A FIGURE OF SUCH IMMENSE DIGNITY THAT IT CAN ONLY BELONG TO THE STATION-MASTER UTTERS TO HIM ACROSS THE HURLY-BURLY A WILD CALL FOR HELP
THAT GIVES ME THREE HOURS AND THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES IN WHICH TO LOOK FOR IT
THAT IF AS WAS PROBABLE THERE WASN'T A PROPER BATHROOM IN THE LITTLE HOUSE IT WOULD BE SICKENING
THEN I HAD ANOTHER
PREPARE TO--ER--COME A WALK UP THE HILL WITH ME HELP
IT CONCERNS THE REGIMENT THE DEAR OLD REGIMENT BOTH MEN SALUTED AND THE COLONEL WENT ON HOARSELY WERE THE NEWS IN THIS DOCUMENT TO BECOME PUBLIC PROPERTY BEFORE ITS TIME NOTHING COULD AVERT THE DEFEAT OF ENGLAND IN THE PRESENT WORLD-WIDE CATACLYSM IS IT AS IMPORTANT AS THAT COLONEL SAID THE MAJOR EVEN MORE HOARSELY IF ANYTHING
AS I SAID IN A FOREWORD TO THE ENGLISH EDITION
HAVE ANOTHER SHOT
THE FLAT SEEMED A VERY LONG WAY AWAY BUT HAVING BOUGHT TWICE AS MUCH ICE AS I WANTED AND AN ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY LOBSTER I WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE STILL MORE MONEY IN TAXIS
IN THE BLUE DAYS OF SUMMER PRINCES AND PRINCESSES LORDS AND LADIES CHAMBERLAINS AND ENCHANTERS WOULD RIDE PAST HIM AND LEAVE HIM VAGUELY DISSATISFIED WITH HIS COMPANY SO THAT HE WOULD REMOVE THE STRAW FROM HIS MOUTH AND GAZE AFTER THEM WONDERING WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE AS LITTLE REGARD FOR A SWINEHERD AS THEY
MY ENEMY HE WROTE THERE IS NOBODY IN THE WHOLE OF THE ROULLENS AERODROME WHOM I DO NOT DETEST WITH A DETESTATION BESIDE WHICH MY HATRED FOR YOU SEEMS AS MAUDLIN ADORATION
BUT FANCY HOLDING FORTH ON AN AUTHOR'S STYLE AFTER READING HIM LABORIOUSLY WITH A DICTIONARY
OH ARTHUR ARTHUR TAKE ME AWAY
THAT IS NOT NECESSARY
HER MAN BEGAN ON THE STAIRS
ANYWAY AT ONE TIME BLAKE WAS ACTUALLY COMMANDING THE BRIGADE
SIMPSON THE VILLA HAS BEEN LENT TO YOU
MY LORD MAYOR MY LORDS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT LOOKED MUCH BETTER
WHICH WAS RIGHT
WE'RE REALLY HERE
I'VE MISSED
VI
ANOTHER GLASS OF SHERRY JENKINS AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE HALL ON THEIR WAY TO THE DRAWING-ROOM LORD BLIGHT STOPPED A MOMENT AT THE ANEROID BAROMETER AND GAVE IT AN ENCOURAGING TAP
SO I WON'T REMIND MYSELF OF THE NUMBER OF COPIES WHICH WE SOLD
HE NEVER QUITE RAN WHEN THE BATTLE BEGAN BUT HE STARTED AT ONCE TO BOW-WOW HARD
WHAT THE PLAYERS ARE SAYING IS NOT DISTINGUISHABLE BUT A MERRY GIRLISH LAUGH RINGS OUT NOW AND THEN FOLLOWED BY THE SHORT SARDONIC CHUCKLE OF AN OBVIOUS MAN OF THE WORLD
IT WAS HIS OLD RIVAL
IT WAS THUS THAT HE LOST HIS TAIL
IT WAS AN UNSATISFYING LIFE
YOU KNOW ALL THESE ARE OLIVE TREES YOU CHAPS HE SAID EVERY FIVE MINUTES
HE SALUTED AND HURRIED OUT
TO MY GREAT RELIEF I FOUND THAT CELIA WAS RIGHT
COULD I BUT TURN HIM OUT OF THE REGIMENT FOR GOOD I MIGHT WIN THE LOVE OF THE FAIR MISS BLOWHARD THE COLONEL'S DAUGHTER IN A SUDDEN PASSION HE PICKED UP THE MANUAL OF MILITARY LAW AND FLUNG IT TO THE GROUND
EVERYBODY HAD NOTICED IT
BUT A GREAT HOPE HAD ALWAYS SUSTAINED HIM
SHOULD YOU WISH D--N SAID THE SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT
WELL MY DEAR HE WENT ON TO HIS DAUGHTER I'M SURE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW THAT PRINCE FREDERICK HAS CONSENTED TO STAY WITH US FOR A LITTLE
A LOUD HEAR HEAR FROM THE GALLERY RANG THROUGH THE COURT AND LOOKING UP MR BELLINGHAM CAUGHT THE SARDONIC EYE OF THE MYSTERIOUS JASPER
WE CAN EASILY HAVE A BED PUT UP FOR YOU IN THE GARAGE AND THEN NOT AFTER LUNCH SAID THOMAS
THEN SOMEONE ANDS ME OUT A DRINK WHAT POETS CALL THE COOLING DRAFT AND SEEING IM I DONE A THINK
BUT DOESN'T HE GUESS WHAT THE PROVERB IS HE ASKED
WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN THEN CAME THE QUESTION OF POSTING IT
I JUST DROPPED GENTLY CRAWLED A YARD AND RESTED SICKISH WITH A THIRST THE EAT I THOUGHT AND SMOKING ARD
I PUT IN A WALTZ AND IT PLAYED IT PERFECTLY
NOW WE SHALL BE ABLE--WHY WHAT'S THIS I LOOKED AT IT CLOSELY
AND WHERE ARE THEY SPENDING THE HONEYMOON
THERE YOU ARE I SAT DOWN AND WROTE THE ARTICLE
GOOD OR HE WOULD LIE AT FULL LENGTH AND GAZE AT A BUD BURSTING INTO FLOWER
ON THE NEXT DAY THEY ALL WENT TO THE DERBY TOGETHER
A HASTY SEARCH TO FIND THE CARD AND REASSURE MYSELF THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY THE DAY--(IT IS AND 10 P.M
THEY ADVANCED
BESIDES WE WERE ALL KEEN ENOUGH TO GO
BUT CHIEFLY I WAS FAMOUS FOR MY PLAYING OF ONE PIECE
IF ONLY I SHOULD TELL MYSELF--"IF ONLY WE HAD RUN THREE INSTEAD OF TWO FOR THAT CUT TO SQUARE-LEG SUPPOSE IT WERE SIXTEEN
I ROLLED UP AT THE PARTY WITH MY LITTLE PRESENT...A MASSIVE SILVER CIGAR-CASE...SUITABLY ENGRAVED
I MAY CONFESS NOW THAT I WAS NERVOUS
THE ELDEST SON ABRAHAM HAD A DOG WHO USED TO GO AND VISIT THE THREE BROTHERS OCCASIONALLY
MANY PRINCES HAD SOUGHT HER HAND BUT IN VAIN FOR SHE WAS AS PROUD AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
THERE IS HOWEVER NO COMPULSION IN THE MATTER AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE--WELL WELL LET US GET ON
I MET A MAN IN A MOTOR-'BUS HE SAID IN A QUIET VOICE WHO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD FOUR SONS
JUST BECAUSE YOU DID IT ONCE WHEN THE SUN WAS IN MY EYES BOBBY BOBBY I SAID THIS IS PAINFUL HEARING
AT DINNER THAT NIGHT MYRA COULD HARDLY EAT FOR EXCITEMENT
CAN'T I POSSIBLY LOSE IT NOW SHE ASKED
THE NEXT THREE WORDS WERE DISPOSED OF EASILY ENOUGH A LUCKY QUESTION TO PETER ABOUT THE WEATHER GIVING HIM AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFER TO HIS STRAW HAT
IT HAS DETERMINED BINGO UNALTERABLY TO GROW UP IN THE RIGHT WAY
BUT JUST TO SAY HERE THEY ARE IS TO BE TOO INFORMAL FOR MY PUBLISHER
I GOT UP SLIGHTLY REFRESHED
THERE WAS A YOUNG PUPPY CALLED HOWARD WHO AT FIGHTING WAS RATHER A COWARD
THE ORDERLY CAME BACK
YOU REALLY KNOW YOU'RE THERE THEN
IT WAS THAT NO CRASH COULD INVOLVE HIS STOMACH WHICH HE INVARIABLY LEFT BEHIND HIM AS SOON AS THE AEROPLANE ROSE
TOOT FIFE DOWN TO THE SEA THE CLOSE-CROPPED PASTURES ROLL COUCHES BEHIND YON SANDY HILL THE GOAL WHEREAT IT MAY BE AFTER CEASELESS STRIFE THE COLONEL SHALL FIND PEACE AND HENRY SAY YOUR HOLE
I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR MY BALL
YOU MEAN A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE CORRECTED HERBERT
HE ADDS EXPLAINED HI-YOU THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S GREAT VALOUR IS ONLY EXCELLED BY THE DISTINCTION OF YOUR MAJESTY'S APPEARANCE DEAR ME SAID THE KING I THOUGHT HE WAS MERELY REPEATING HIMSELF
IF ALGERNON AND MRS THOMPSON WERE TO MEET NOW WOULD SHE NOT BE EXPECTING HIM TO TURN UP AT EVERY COURSE
WHAT HAPPENED WAS DIFFERENT
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ON CELIA'S WEDDING-RING THAT HAD NEVER BEEN IN ANY OTHER'S
HERE HE IS
BESIDES THE THING IS COMING BACK AGAIN AS CHICKEN DIRECTLY
HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
SO THOUGH WE HAD BEEN TO BUT FEW OF THE FAMOUS BEAUTY SPOTS AROUND WE HAD HAD A DELIGHTFULLY LAZY TIME
WE ARE ALONE I HISSED--OR WHATEVER YOU DO TO A SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY S'S IN IT TO MAKE IT DRAMATIC
GOODWOOD LO
I'VE ONLY JUST THOUGHT OF IT LATER ON THE POST-CORPORAL CAME AND THE JOKE STARTED ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND
BLACKMAN'S WARBLER I SAID FIRMLY
AND THE EIGHTH TIME HE SAID YOUR FACE IS STRANGELY FAMILIAR TO ME PERCHANCE WE MET IN MILVANIA SAID THE PRINCE PLEASANTLY
I LOVE YOU CELIA BUT THAT WOULD BE A LOVELY THING SHE SAID CLASPING HER HANDS EAGERLY
BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WE WERE GETTING OUT OF THE TRAIN
OF THE PROSPECTS OF JOAN I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOVE
HUMPH SAID FREDERICK
TWO ANYTHING--TWO MORE SISTERS IF YOU LIKE
MYRA WAS SILENT
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU HE SAID
YES QUITE SO BUT IF YOU WOULD ONLY THINK A LITTLE I SAID THINKING HARD ALL THE TIME YOU WOULD--WELL PUT IT THIS WAY
HOW ROMANTIC
THE YEAR'S AT THE FULL AND THE MORN'S AT ELEVEN IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY JUST STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN AND THIS IS A HOLE I CAN DO IN SEVEN CADDIE MY DRIVER PLEASE
HOW DO YOU MAKE A SPECIALTY OF LIMPETS WELL I SUPPOSE YOU--ER--STUDY THEM
I'M MARY SHE SAID
ABOVE ALL I SHOULD LIKE TO BRING HOME TO YOU THE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE BOUGHT AND OPENED THE TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT AND READ HIS FIRST REVIEW
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER THE PRINCESS WENT ON LOOKING AT HI-YOU IF THIS GENTLEMAN OF COURSE MY DEAR OF COURSE
SINCE THE NEWS FIRST GOT ABOUT THAT ORLANDO WHAT'S-HIS-NAME MADE L50,000 OUT OF THE CRIMSON SPONGE THERE HAS BEEN A FEELING THAT ONLY THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE STAGE CAN LITERARY ART FIND ITS TRUE EXPRESSION
IT WAS LORD SMITH
THEY MARRY"--I LOOKED AT MY LIMPET WITH A NEW INTEREST--"AND BRING UP FAMILIES AND GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS AND IT ALL MEANS JUST AS MUCH TO THEM AS IT DOES TO US MY LIMPET'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS MEAN NOTHING TO ME I SAID FIRMLY
III IT WAS TWO YEARS LATER
THE INVITATION DEAR MYRA WROTE SIMPSON AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR--"I HAVE AN IMPORTANT SUGGESTION TO MAKE TO YOU BOTH AND I AM COMING ROUND TO-MORROW NIGHT AFTER DINNER ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK
YOU COULD HAVE WRITTEN
AS BEFORE HE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE HEAVY ROLLER AND HE WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SLACKEN THE ROPES OF THE NET AT THE END OF THE DAY
I WAS A SECOND LIEUTENANT ON PROBATION ON MY RIGHT SLEEVE I WORE A SINGLE STAR
I'VE FORGOTTEN MY PURSE NO SYSTEMS SAID DAHLIA
SOMETIMES I--ER--SHAW--ER--WELL IT'S WITH A GESTURE SOMEWHAT GALLIC HOW CAN I PUT IT NOT THACKERAY AT ALL HE SAYS WATCHING ME EAGERLY
SURELY IF EARL BARLOW HAD SEEN US HE WOULD HAVE ASKED US IN
ALL OF THEM WORDS WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INCLUDE NATURALLY IN AN ANSWER TO AN ORDINARY QUESTION
IN FIVE MINUTES I SHALL MISS AGAIN BUT WHAT'S THE POINT THE POINT DEAR FRIEND I SMILED IS THAT AFTER EACH STROKE ONE IS ALLOWED FIVE MINUTES IN WHICH TO FIND THE BALL
SISTERLY ASSISTANCE I WAS TALKING TO A VERY STUPID MAN THE OTHER DAY
LET'S MAKE A COLLECTION AND PUT IT ALL ON ONE NUMBER AND HOPE IT WILL WIN DAHLIA HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN READING NOVELS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE BANK
LOTS OF OLD GENTLEMEN SHUT THEIR EYES AND MISS THE SPHERE
MEN OF THE NTH BLANKSHIRES SAID THE COLONEL ADDRESSING THEM A DOCUMENT OF ENORMOUS IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM THIS ROOM
THURSDAY 12.45 P.M I WROTE
THE PANORAMA FROM THE SCALBY CLIFFS IS UNRIVALLED
AH SMITH MY BOY SAID THE MAJOR GENIALLY I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THE ADDRESS OF YOUR TAILOR
IN AN IMMENSE HALL WHOSE ACOUSTICS WHO ARE THEY WELL NEVER MIND
YOU KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF LANCASHIRE MY DEAR MAN GIRLS CAN'T BOWL
WELL I SAID I CAN TELL YOU WHAT LIMPETS ARE FOR NOW
I WAS INVITED TO THE WEDDING--CONFOUND HIM
THE BANK WOULD SEND OUT FOR MORE MONEY
NO WELL THAT'S THAT
THEN HANDS HIM A CUP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE--THUS DECEIVING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE
PERHAPS MOST OF ALL YOUR
IT WAS CELIA WHO INTRODUCED ME TO HIM
WELL I SAID YOU'RE THE OFFICER COMMANDING PLATOON NUMBER FIFTEEN FIFTEEN
HAVING LOST HE PLAYED ANOTHER HUNDRED DOUBLE OR QUITS AND THEN RODE BACK THE COLUMN BY THIS TIME HAVING TRAVELLED TWICE ITS OWN LENGTH AND A DISTANCE EQUAL TO THE DISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED IF IT HAD BEEN GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
IT IS CURIOUS WENT ON THE COLONEL THAT IN FEATURES YOU RESEMBLE ANOTHER OLD FRIEND OF MINE LORD SMITH MY NAME IS SMITHLORD SIR AH
AND HE DIDN'T LIKE IT
YOU SHALL TAKE MY PLACE IS THAT QUITE FAIR TO RISSOLE ASKED BLANCHAILLE DOUBTFULLY
TO BE LYRICAL OVER ANYBODY CALLED HOWARD COMMON WITHOUT HINTING THAT HE--WELL TRY FOR YOURSELF
MISTAKES MISTAKES YES--YOU ARE RIGHT HE STRETCHED OUT A HAND TOOK A LETTER FROM THE DESK IN FRONT OF HIM AND GAVE IT TO HER
HE FELT SUFFOCATED
HE FELT SUFFOCATED
THERE ARE LOUD CRIES OF ENCORE MR MOTT SHAKES HIS HEAD
HALLO THOMAS OLD BOY HE FIXED HIS SPECTACLES FIRMLY ON HIS NOSE AND BEAMED ROUND THE ROOM
AS THE CROW FLIES FIFTEEN MILES AWAY
TELL ME HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO MEN IN MARS I SAT UP WITH A SIGH
IN ORDER TO PLACE YOU IN THAT POSITION I MUST LET YOU KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY WELL I PLAYED THE PIANOLA
OUR HOST AS HE ADMITTED AFTERWARDS WAS STILL QUITE IN THE DARK AND WITH HIS LAST QUESTION HE PRESENTED HERBERT WITH AN ABSOLUTE GIFT
ON RECEIPT OF THIS NOTE ANDREW HAD GONE TO THE RENDEZVOUS AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO HIM WHEN JASPER STEPPED OUT AND OFFERED TO SELL HIM A PACKET CONTAINING A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE A PHOTOGRAPH OF AN OLD GENTLEMAN DIPPING A SHEEP A PEPPERMINT LOZENGE WITH JESS ON IT AND VARIOUS OTHER DOCUMENTS FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS
E FOR--E FOR I TURNED HELPLESSLY TO CELIA
TO AVOID A RIOT THOMAS WENT BEHIND SIMPSON'S BACK AND TOOK HIS SURPRISE AWAY FROM HIM
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF ME
ISN'T MARKSLAND THE ALLY OF BOROVIA
GOODBYE GOOD-BYE SAID MYRA LINGERINGLY
AND OTHERS MY FILM SCENARIO SPECIALLY WRITTEN FOR ECONOMIC PICTURES LIMITED WHOSE MANAGER HAS HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO PICK UP FOR A MERE SONG OR TO BE MORE ACCURATE FOR A FEW NOTES SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES OF DISCARDED CINEMA FILMS FROM A BANKRUPT COMPANY
THE TWO PEOPLE WHOM YOU ASKED TO THINK OF THE NUMBERS ARE CONFEDERATES AND YOU ARRANGED WITH THEM BEFOREHAND THAT THEY SHOULD WRITE DOWN 10 AND 17
OR STABLE DOORS OR FRYING-PANS
SOMETIMES I ADMITTED
THAT WAS ALL RIGHT MYRA WASN'T IT HE SAID PROUDLY
SHE WAS JUST GOING TO HAVE SAID IT HERSELF SHE TOLD ME
WHAT DID WIN ASKED MYRA SOME MINUTES LATER WHEN THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD NEVER SEE OUR MONEY AGAIN HAD BEEN BROUGHT HOME TO HER
OPH WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT MY LORD
ONLY--ONLY LET IT BE ORIGINAL
HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS HE CRIED IN A VOICE OF THUNDER AND WITH A GASP OF HORROR THEY READ THE FATAL WORDS
NOW ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE IN THE CASE OF A FEW MEN AT THE TOP OF THE PROFESSION TO LEAVE THE CONDUCT OF THE CIGARETTE ENTIRELY TO THE ACTOR YOU WILL FIND IT MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY TO INSERT IN THE STAGE DIRECTIONS THE PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS WITH MATCH AND SO FORTH THAT YOU WISH CARRIED OUT
NO I SAID THOUGHTFULLY
CONSIDER
I NEED NOT DESCRIBE TWO-HUNDRED-LORRIES-ON-A-DARK-EVENING TO YOU
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING HERE TILL THE COLONEL COMES BACK
IF POSSIBLE AMONG THE WATTLES
SHE MUST NEVER KNOW LISTEN
BUT THIS IS GLORIOUS NEWS
EVERY DAY
THE GENERAL LOOKED INQUIRING AND STARTED FEELING FOR HIS GLASSES
WELL MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HAVE PASSED
WE'D BETTER HAVE DINNER A BIT EARLIER TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE I SAID AS MYRA GAVE ME A PARTING BRUSH DOWN IN THE HALL
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE RIDDLE MY DEAR SAID THE SQUIRE TO MISS PHIPPS ALWAYS A FAVOURITE OF HIS
AND SO I SHOULD HAVE DONE--OR POSSIBLY I AM AFRAID HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ANSWER AT ALL--BUT FOR THE WAY THAT THE LETTER ENDED UP
THE SUNNY SIDE I
WHERE SHOULD HE PUT THEM
IT IS LIFE LIFE
AND THEN FEELING ANOTHER MAN TO REPLACE HIM ON THE MUSIC-STOOL AND APOLOGIZE TO CELIA
I WENT ON THINKING
AND DOWNSTAIRS POOR JOHNNY WILL FIND TO HIS HORROR ONE DAY THAT HIS GREAT WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO THE WORLD BY ANOTHER--A CERTAIN DR JOHN BULL
GASPARD VOLAUVENT COULD NEVER GET TO THE RENDEZVOUS ALONE AND IT WOULD BE FATAL TO HIS HONOUR IF JACQUES ARRIVED THERE AND FOUND NOBODY TO MEET HIM
BUT WHEN HE IS NOT BEING TECHNICAL I LIKE TO THINK THAT HE SUMS ME UP TO HIMSELF AS A NICE MAN
ACCOMPANIED SOMETIMES BY A BAND OF COWBOYS SOMETIMES BY A TRIBE OF INDIANS RICHARD SCOURED THE CONTINENT FOR HIS ENEMY
SO THE SOLILOQUY CAME INTO BEING
PROBABLY HE WANTS US ALL TO GO TO THE ZOO TOGETHER
WON'T THAT BE LOVELY RICHARD HENRY HAVING BEEN DECEIVED AS HE FEELS ABOUT THE SEA IS NOT TOO HOPEFUL ABOUT THAT CRAB
THE BILLIARD-ROOM AND ALL THE SPARE BEDROOMS WELL STOCKED ANNE SAW THAT THIS WAS MEANT HUMOROUSLY AND SHE LAUGHED
AND INDEED IT WAS A PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE THEM SITTING TOGETHER ON THE TOP OF A HILL THE WORLD AT THEIR FEET DISCUSSING AT ONE TIME THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF MILVANIA AT ANOTHER THE LATEST BALLAD OF THE COUNTRYSIDE OR EVEN IN THEIR MORE HOPEFUL MOMENTS PLANNING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WHEN FREDERICK AT LAST WAS RESTORED TO PUBLIC LIFE
THEN WENT HOME TO BED
THIS HAS THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF PUTTING THE AUDIENCE IMMEDIATELY IN SYMPATHY WITH YOUR HERO
I BEGGED HER TO KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP TO WHICH SHE REPLIED THAT SHE COULD DO IT BETTER IF I PROMISED NOT TO KEEP A BRISTLY ONE
DARLING LITTLE CRAB HE SAYS
THUS ENTER FROM THE LEFT MISS DEVEREUX
SEVENTEEN WHAT I SAID
THE CUCUMBER
HIS HEALTH TOO WAS BENEFITING BY THE CONSTANT SEA AIR AND CHANGE
AND I IMAGINE THAT EVERY WORD OF HIS BELOVED LANGUAGE WHICH APPEARS HOWEVER CASUALLY IN AN ENGLISH PAPER MYSTERIOUSLY CATCHES HIS EYE AND BRINGS THE SCENT AND SOUNDS OF THE BOULEVARDS TO HIM ACROSS THE COFFEE-CUPS
MYRA I'M SURE I'M TIDY NOW PIPE TOBACCO MATCHES KEYS MONEY EVERYTHING I SAID
HE WOULD FILL HIS HAT WITH THEM
HIS HEART BEAT RAPIDLY
I SHALL LEAVE YOU HERE I SAID AFTER I HAD SMOKED A CIGARETTE AND DIPPED INTO THE CATALOGUE AGAIN AND MAKE MY PURCHASE
BY THE TIME I HAD SHAKEN OFF MRS THOMPSON I WAS ALMOST AT THE FISHMONGER'S
IF IT WAS REALLY ONLY FORTY THEN I'M COUNTING FIVE OCCASIONS WHEN THE BALL ROLLED OVER AS I WAS ADDRESSING IT
I'M NOT QUITE SURE THIS SEASON WHETHER I HADN'T BETTER SLOW SAID DICK THOUGHTFULLY
MYRA HAS CHARGE OF THE CLOCKWORK MOUSE AND WE OTHERS HANG ABOUT AND SING
HUMPHREY FOUND HIMSELF ON THE TOP OF MY STOCKING LAST DECEMBER PUT THERE I FANCY BY CELIA THOUGH SHE SAYS IT WAS FATHER CHRISTMAS
WHETHER HE WAS A PLEASANT SORT OF PERSON OR NOT I HARDLY NOTICED
YOU DO NOT WANT TO SAY DUKE DROPPING ASH ON TROUSERS IT SEEMS TO ME MY LOVE OR DUKE REMOVING STRAY PIECE OF TOBACCO FROM TONGUE WHAT IRELAND NEEDS IS
ANYWAY IT SEEMS TO BE HERS NOW
GOOD HEAVENS
MY HUSBAND AND I YOU SHOULD SAY ARE NOT ALONE
I BEGIN TO THINK THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN A TADPOLE AFTER ALL MURMURS LORD POLDOODLE TO HIMSELF AS THE AUTHOR WRIGGLES HER WAY OUT
WE MUST GET OURSELVES INTO PROPER ORDER HE SAID
I WAS SO VERY PLEASANT MYSELF
WE FEEL NOW THAT THERE ARE ROMANTIC POSSIBILITIES ABOUT LETTERS SETTING FORTH ON THEIR JOURNEY FROM OUR FLOOR
THE ARRIVAL OF BLACKMAN'S WARBLER I AM BECOME AN AUTHORITY ON BIRDS
IT WAS I WHO HID THE SECRET DOCUMENT IN HIS POCKET
ONE WAY AND ANOTHER YOU GET TO KNOW THINGS ABOUT THEM THEY MUST HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR THINKING SAID CELIA REGARDING MY LIMPET WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE
TUT TUT SIR WHAT IS THIS SAID THE COLONEL
DAHLIA FROWNED
BUT NOW I MUST GIVE YOU A WARNING
THE THIRD TIME I WAS SUCCESSFUL
YOU ARRIVE AT THE VILLAGE AND GET FROM THE MAYOR OR THE TOWN MAJOR A LIST OF POSSIBLE HOSTESSES
DEAR ME DEAR ME HUMPH REMARKED FREDERICK FEELING IT WAS TIME HE SAID SOMETHING
TRY IT AGAIN SIMPSON AND GET A LITTLE MORE COLOUR INTO IT HE TRIED AGAIN AND GOT A LOT MORE COLOUR INTO IT
AFTER A LITTLE THOUGHT I BEGAN TO WRITE
HAVE YOU GOT ANY LANTERN SLIDES THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY BUT THEY'RE MUCH MORE FUN
I CAN FLOOD HIS BATHROOM WHENEVER I LIKE
WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID JUST NOW
IF ESSENLAND OCCUPIES RURITANIA CAN ANY THINKING MAN IN BOROVIA FEEL SAFE WITH THE ENEMY AT HIS GATES THE BOROVIAN PEASANT EARNING FIVE MARKS A WEEK WOULD HAVE FELT NO LESS SAFE THAN USUAL BUT THEN HE COULD HARDLY BE DESCRIBED AS A THINKING MAN IT IS VITAL TO THE PRESTIGE OF BOROVIA THAT THE INTEGRITY OF RURITANIA SHOULD BE PRESERVED
BLUE SKY IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH IMAGINATION AND STILL BLUER SEA
SAMUEL WANTS SOME TOO SAID MYRA
EACH TIME THAT WE SEND A LETTER OFF WE LISTEN IN A TREMBLE OF EXCITEMENT FOR THE FINAL FLOP AND WHEN IT COMES I THINK WE BOTH FEEL VAGUELY THAT WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR SOMETHING
APART FROM WHAT WAS DUE TO HIS ANCESTORS WERE WE ENCOURAGING HIM ENOUGH TO GROW INTO A PEKINESE
IT WOULD THEN LEAK OUT THAT CHEVALIER SIMPSON--THE TALL POETICAL-LOOKING GENTLEMAN IN THE MIDDLE MY DEAR--HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM NO LESS A SUM THAN THIRTY FRANCS WITH WHICH TO BREAK THE BANK AND THAT HE PROPOSED TO DO THIS IN ONE DARING COUP
OBSERVE US THEN AN EAGER FOUR ADVANCING ON THE WESTERN DOOR OR POSSIBLY THE NORTHERN OR WELL ANYHOW ADVANCING
I LEFT OUT THE TABLE-MONEY I DID IT HASTILY AGAIN AND MADE IT THREE MINUTES TWENTY-FIVE SECONDS
LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT-HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET
NOT EVEN LOBSTER SAUCE
THOMAS
THE HONEYMOONERS HAD THEIR LITTLE BREAKFAST IN THEIR OWN LITTLE HOUSE AND THEN JOINED THE OTHERS FOR THE DAY AT ABOUT TEN
SIX MONTHS LATER I HAD A VERY PLEASANT NOTE FROM THE KING TELLING ME THAT THE DAYS OF PROBATION WERE NOW OVER AND MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE AND I WERE FRIENDS
ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE YOU
HE CAME
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND THE GERMAN FLEET WE SINK I'M GOING TO KEEP A SILK-WORM'S EGG AND LISTEN TO IT THINK THE CAPTAINS AND THE KINGS DEPART IT MAY BE SO BUT NOT LIEUTENANTS
SAY STARTING ON SATURDAY WEEK
I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
THERE SAID THE KING IN GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
NOR WAS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE WORDS WERE INDEED THE PRINCE'S OWN AS DICTATED TO HI-YOU AND BY HIM PUT ON PAPER FOR THE CHANCELLOR
AT NINE-STONE-TWELVE I JUMPED OFF FOR A MOMENT AND SHUT THE WINDOW
2
UNFORTUNATELY IT FELL OFF IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL SOMEHOW
WHEW AND SHE FANNED HERSELF WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF
YOU WILL ALL BE VERY GLAD TO HEAR--AH--YOU WILL ALL BE SORRY TO HEAR THAT WE HAVE ONLY ONE MORE POET ON OUR LIST THIS AFTERNOON
POOR SHORT-SIGHTED CREATURE
EXTRACT FROM LETTER
IT WAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS_--NOT YEARS
YE GODS
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT IT WOULD PLEASE PORKINS WHATEVER HAS MARIA BEGAN A VERY YOUNG GOD BUT HE WAS IMMEDIATELY SUPPRESSED
WHAT NOT WHAT--WHAT WOULD WHAT WELL I SAY IT TO MYSELF DAY AND NIGHT
THE OCCUPANT LOWERED THE NEWSPAPER FROM IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND LOOKED UP
PERHAPS PERCY WILL OVERCOME THIS AVERSION IN TIME
ACTUALLY I'M DOUBTFUL IF THE BALL DID ROLL OVER FIVE TIMES BUT I SAY IT DID IN ORDER TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
WHEN MARIA'S LETTER CAME HE FELT THAT THE ONLY THING TO DO WAS TO DROWN HIMSELF
TO-NIGHT HE WOULD MEET HER AGAIN
I SHRINK FROM EVERY NEW MAN I MEET
AT ALL COSTS HE MUST PRESERVE HIS LITTLE HYACINTH FROM SHAME
FOR A FORTNIGHT NOW HE HAD BEEN LIVING ON THE BELT ITSELF
WHAT CAN SHE SEE IN THAT PUPPY
TWO FLIPPERTIES A FLOOR
ANOTHER SHOT PUT HIM LEVEL WITH ME
RELINQUISHES THE RANK OF ACTING SECOND LIEUTENANT ON CEASING TO COMMAND A BATTALION AND REVERTS TO THE RANK OF SECOND LIEUTENANT FAILING THIS I HAVE THOUGHT SOMETIMES OF MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN OF THE TIMES
ANOTHER BOTTLE HE SAID
ANOTHER BOTTLE HE SAID
THAT IS WHY HE IS ALWAYS PLAYING WITH THE LAWN-MOWER THE EARL FROWNED AND TAPPED ON HIS DESK WITH A PENHOLDER
REALLY SAID THE OTHER I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS
WELL THERE ARE MORE WAYS THAN ONE
YOU MIGHT BUY TWO MORE STARS THIS AFTERNOON AND PRACTISE SEWING THEM ON IN ORDER TO BE READY
THEY'LL WONDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US IF WE WAIT ANY LONGER
AND STILL IT GOES ON--_FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY_--GROWING FAINTER IN THE DISTANCE
I'VE BEEN LENT A VILLA HE SAID
GOING TO SEE A CRAB SAYS RICHARD HENRY DETERMINED TO KEEP UP HIS END OF THE CONVERSATION
STEALING BY FINDING THEY CALL IT
THREE THIRTY-FIVE
AND JOHN WHO AT THE PALACE FELL A VICTIM TO THE BLONDIN BELLE IS WEDDED TO ANOTHER
HIS TRAINING AT THE ROYAL CIRCUS STOOD HIM IN GOOD STEAD
HOWEVER IT'S PLEASANT TO THINK THAT THE TAXI MUST HAVE BEEN NICE AND COOL FOR THE NEXT MAN
I'LL TAKE IT FOR A WEEK AND SEE IF I CAN GET RID OF IT
ONCE THESE ARE LOCKED UP IN YOUR SAFE NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW THAT YOU WERE MARRIED IN CORNWALL TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION MR BELLINGHAM TOOK A HANDFUL OF BANK NOTES FROM HIS POCKETBOOK AND THE EXCHANGE WAS MADE
BY THE END OF A MONTH WE MUST HAVE PLAYED A DOZEN ROUNDS OF THIS NATURE
THEY'RE JUST FOR US
NEXT MORNING IT WAS ON HIS DRESSING-TABLE AGAIN
FOR INDEED I AM VERY SURE THAT WHEN HI-YOU WAS A SWINEHERD UPON THE HILLS HE BELIEVED TRULY THAT THE LITTLE BLACK PIG WITH THE CURLY TAIL WAS A PRINCE
APPARENTLY SHE PUT IT THERE
BY THE WAY SIMPSON DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE INVITED PETER
I DON'T WONDER THAT SO WARLIKE A RACE AS THE JAPANESE HAS CALLED A PROVINCE AFTER HIM
IT'S ON THE ESTATE
THE BAR REMAINED DOWN
ARE THEY VERY MUCH ALIKE MY HOSTESS ASKED ME MUCH IMPRESSED
THIS STAR ALSO WAS NOW A FIXED ONE
BUT HAVEN'T YOU MADE A MISTAKE ASKED THE VERY YOUNG GOD
FOR INSTANCE IF AT CHRISTMAS SAY OR ON HIS PARENT'S NATAL DAY THE THOUGHTLESS LAD FORGOT TO PAY THE CUSTOMARY GREETING HIS FATHER'S VISAGE ONLY TOOK THAT DIGNIFIED REPROACHFUL LOOK WHICH DYING BEETLES GIVE THE COOK ABOVE THE CLOUDS OF KEATING
GOING TO SEE A CRAB HE SAYS FIRMLY
HOWEVER THANK YOU FOR THE CIGAR MY DEAR FELLOW IT ISN'T CRICKLEWOOD
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD BEAR IT I'VE SAVED UP TWO SHILLINGS IT ISN'T THAT--NOT ONLY THAT
HOWEVER AS IT HAPPENED I HAD SOMETHING WHICH I WANTED TO SAY
HOW DO SLUGS GET ANYWHERE
SO THE BETROTHAL OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK OF MILVANIA TO THE PRINCESS AMARIL WAS ANNOUNCED TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE PEOPLE
AND THEN YESTERDAY WHO SHOULD WRITE TO ME BUT JOHNNY'S FATHER HIMSELF
AS GARDENERS WE MUST KEEP UP WITH FLORICULTURAL PROGRESS
TO BEGIN WITH HE TOOK UP RATHER MORE THAN HIS FAIR SHARE OF THE POCKET BUT HE RAPIDLY THINNED DOWN
THE SANDS OF PLEASURE LADIES FIRST SO WE WILL START WITH JENNY
SHE LEANT FORWARD AND KISSED HIM
HAVE YOU GOT THAT
HIS FACE BRISTLED WITH RAGE
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO WRITE NOW AND SAY THAT A PREVIOUS INVITATION FROM THE PRIME MINISTER--AND SO ON
IT IS THE SALMON MAYONNAISE
TO BE FIVE GUESTS OF THE GUEST OF A MAN YOU HAVE NEVER MET IS DELICATE WORK
THE MAN WHO WAS COMING IS ILL BUT WHY YOU PARTICULARLY ONE COMES DOWN TO ME IN THE END I SAID MODESTLY
IT WAS OVER AT LAST AND WE FOLLOWED THE STAFF INDOORS
LET US TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS METHOD WORKS GO BACK AGAIN TO THE PLAY WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING
EXACTLY RIGHT I TOOK MY NIBLICK AND SWUNG AT THE HEATHER
OH BUT YOU MUST STOP WITH US
IT WAS--YES YOU HAVE GUESSED--THE SCENE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK WHEN WILLIAM TREWULLIAM MEETS THE LITTLE ANNE AND SHARES HIS LAST RASPBERRY-DROP WITH HER
HIS COMPLEXION WAS DARKER NOW HIS TAIL MORE CURLY BUT THE ROYAL BEARING WAS UNMISTAKABLE
HERBERT DECIDED THAT THE SMALL PIECE OF MERINGUE STILL IN HER HAIR WAS NOT WORTH MENTIONING AND HE LISTENED TO HER WITH INTEREST
AT THIS MOMENT SIMPSON CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE HIS FACE BEAMING WITH EXCITEMENT HIS HANDS CAREFULLY CONCEALING SOMETHING BEHIND HIS BACK
THRICE HAVE I USED MY INFLUENCE TO SEND HIM AWAY ON A MUSKETRY COURSE AND THRICE HAS HE RETURNED
MY DEAR PREPARE FOR A SURPRISE YES FATHER SAID AMARIL DUTIFULLY
IT WAS A GOOD STORY WHILE IT LASTED
ONE COULD ALWAYS WORK IT IN SOMEHOW WELL OF COURSE IF HE ASKED YOU BY WHAT TRAIN COMETH THOU UP IN THE MORNINGS YOU COULD ANSWER I COMETH UP BY THE TEN-FIFTEEN ONLY YOU DON'T GET THAT SORT OF QUESTION AS A RULE OH I SEE SAID HERBERT
I EVEN WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT COOKING IN THE GREAT WAR FEELING THAT THAT WOULD SURELY TEMPT THEM BUT THEY WERE NOT TO BE DRAWN
IF WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE--WELL I DON'T WANT TO SEEM TO HARP ON IT BUT SAY CALCEOLARIAS THEN QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHTN'T RECOGNIZE THEM AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY WERE
MEN OF LETTERS MEN OF LETTERS JOHN PENQUARTO A TALE OF LITERARY LIFE IN LONDON MODELLED ON THE HUNDRED BEST AUTHORS I JOHN PENQUARTO LOOKED ROUND HIS DIMINUTIVE BED-SITTING-ROOM WITH A FEELING OF EXCITEMENT NOT UNMIXED WITH AWE
THESE FEW REMARKS ARE CALLED A SOLILOQUY BEING ADDRESSED RATHER TO THE WORLD IN GENERAL THAN TO ANY PARTICULAR PERSON ON THE STAGE
TAKE ROTUNDITY FOR INSTANCE THE NEW NOVEL BY WILLIAM BLANK WHICH ETC BUT BEFORE I WAS READY FOR IT THE ARTICLE WAS FINISHED
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD PLAN TO LEAVE THEM THERE
GOOD-BYE I FLED DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE STREET WAVED TO MYRA AT THE WINDOW
LASHING OUT RIGHT AND LEFT HE FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE MAN HE HAD COME TO RESCUE PULLED HIM UP BEHIND HIM AND AMIDST A HURRICANE OF BULLETS CHARGED BACK TO THE BRITISH LINES
YES HE SAID LOOKING UP AT HER
IT WAS NOW CELIA'S TURN FOR BREAKS NERVOUS I ASKED HER
I TRIED NOT TO LOOK PLEASED
AND IF A PRIVATE'S TENDER THANKS NAY DO NOT BLANK MY BLANKY BLANKS
CHAIRS WERE SWEPT OVER
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT ARCHIE ASSUMED COMMAND
I HAVE MY LIVING TO EARN
HOW DOES BOROVIA STAND HE ASKED
I SHALL ALSO BRUSH MY HAIR
HERE HE IS I SAID
THEN WE CAME TO A WOOD AND I HAD TO DRAG HER THROUGH IT
LET'S SEE THERE'S NONSENSE SAID ANDREW UNEASILY
OR SOMETIMES THROWS TWO TRAVELLERS TOGETHER MARCHES THEM SIDE BY SIDE FOR HALF A MILE THEN SNATCHES THEM APART AND HAULS THEM ONWARD
THE OBVIOUS CELIA HAD BEEN CALLING ON A NEWLY MARRIED FRIEND OF HERS
CELIA I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO SPELL IT WITH AN H CAN'T YOU THINK OF A BETTER WORD ENNY SAID CELIA HAVING QUITE LOST HER NERVE BY THIS TIME
PEOPLE WEREN'T CALLED THAT
GENERALLY FROM VERY NEAR THE FIRE BECAUSE HE HAS GOT SO COLD WAITING IN THE HALL OH YES I SEE AND THEN HE ASKS QUESTIONS AND WE EACH HAVE TO GET ONE OF THE WORDS OF THE PROVERB INTO OUR ANSWER WITHOUT LETTING HIM KNOW WHAT THE PROVERB IS
IT ALSO CALLED ATTENTION TO MY NEW ADDRESS--A SMALL FURNISHED FLAT IN WHICH CELIA AND I COULD JUST TURN ROUND IF WE DID IT SEPARATELY
THREATENED ON ALL SIDES BY GUNS AND BOMBS OF EVERY CALIBRE HE HAD PREPARED TO SELL HIS LIFE DEARLY
I SHOULD LIKE TO DESCRIBE HOW MY HERO'S HEART BEAT DURING THE ANXIOUS DAYS OF WAITING
A THOUGHT THE MUSIC FALLS ACROSS THE VALE FROM NIGHTINGALE TO NIGHTINGALE
WAS IT TOO MUCH FOR HIS POWERS
SHE INVADED RURITANIA
THE GREEKS SHOUTED GREEK
NOW THEN WHAT SHALL WE HAVE FIRST
FRENCH JOKE SHE ADDED KINDLY
YOU'RE DETAILED YOU CAN'T BE DETAILED TO BE A PRESIDENT
FATHER CLOSES HIS EYES
HE IS WEARING IN ADDITION TO WHAT ONE DOESN'T MENTION AN ORDINARY WAISTCOAT A WOOLLY WAISTCOAT FOR STEAMER USE A TWEED COAT AN AQUASCUTUM AN ULSTER A CAMERA AND A BAG OF GOLFCLUBS
WITHOUT THE STAGE CIGARETTE MANY AN EPIGRAM WOULD PASS UNNOTICED MANY AN ACTOR'S HANDS WOULD BE MUCH MORE NOTICEABLE
IF YOUR BALL'S LOST I WIN AFTER ALL NONSENSE
AS PLAYED BY ME THE CHARGE OF THE UHLANS BECAME A WHOLE BATTLE SCENE
I REVIEWED A BOOK THE OTHER DAY
I WANT THIS RING ENGRAVED I SAID
WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE UTMOST ANXIETY UPON HIS FACE HE READ AND RE-READ THE OFFICIAL-LOOKING DOCUMENT WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND
HELP WHISPERED MYRA
TELL ME I SAID GENTLY
AND SHE AND I WOULD TALK OF ART AND POLITICS AND THINGS AS WE HAD TALKED THESE MANY YEARS AGO
I MEAN LUCKILY SHE WENT ON POLAR BEARS DO IT FOR YOU IN THE POLAR REGIONS
BUT HIS MYSTERIOUS VISITOR WAS NOT DONE WITH YET
NURSE BROWN HAS JUST GONE OUT SHE SAID
I WANT I SAID SOME AND THEN A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
SHE PAUSES A MOMENT AND THEN WITH A SUDDEN PASSIONATE MOVEMENT FLINGS HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS TAKE ME AWAY ARTHUR
THAT ENDED THE REVUE
MON DIEU A WOMAN WOULD CRY IN A SHRILL VOICE
HOW LONG WILL THE STRIKE LAST SHE SAID EARNESTLY
ABOVE THE SEAWEED AN ANEMONE SAT FATLY
DISILLUSIONED THE CARD WAS JUST AN ORDINARY CARD THE LETTER JUST AN ORDINARY LETTER
DUKES MAYORS COMPANIONS OF ST MICHAEL AND ST GEORGE CERTAINLY
ALTHOUGH UNWOUNDED BY THE ENEMY THE EXPOSURE OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY HAD BROUGHT ON A SEVERE ATTACK OF MUMPS
IT WAS TIME FOR LORD BLIGHT TO FORGET THESE INCIDENTS OF HIS EAGER AND IMPETUOUS YOUTH
TOBY IS A NICE HORSE
YES SIR HE SAID
THE MORNING IS THE BEST TIME I'M AFRAID HE IS A COWARD SAID MOTHER SADLY WONDERING WHY SHE HAD MARRIED HIM
I THINK IT IS TIME FOR MY MEDICINE IN ANSWER TO THE COLONEL'S RING A NURSE APPEARED
AS THIN AS THIS SAYS THE DOCTOR HOOKING HIS STETHOSCOPE ON TO ONE OF MY RIBS AND THEN GOING ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE HOW I AM GETTING ON THERE
AS THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR THREE MONTHS AND AS THE LINE I MENTIONED HAS TWO SPECIAL REHEARSALS TO ITSELF BEFORE COMING OUT RIGHT YOU CAN EASILY WORK OUT HOW MANY SEND-HIM-VICTORIOUSES JOHNNY AND I HAVE COLLABORATED IN
HOWEVER I WROTE A LETTER IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THE WAR
SUDDENLY ALL EYES WERE FIXED ON SECOND-LIEUTENANT LORD SMITH AS WITH HORROR AND AMAZEMENT UPON HIS FACE HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE OFFICIAL-LOOKING ENVELOPE
O CROSSE AND BLACKWELL LIMITED
THANKS FOR A VERY JOLLY EVENING
AT LAST MY LOVE WE ARE TOGETHER HE MURMURED AS THEY NEARED WIMBLEDON
OTHERS MAY HAVE SEEN VENICE BY MOONLIGHT OR HEARD THE VICAR'S DAUGHTER RECITE LITTLE JIM BUT THE FAVOURED FEW WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENT WHEN BOHM AND I WERE COLLABORATING ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE REALLY LIVED
HIS OWN IS ADMIRABLE AND I HAVE NO WISH FOR HIM TO REMOVE IT BUT I THINK HE SHOULD BE EQUALLY BROAD-MINDED ABOUT MINE
YOU VILLAIN CRIED ANDREW EVEN AT THE TRIAL I SUSPECTED YOU AND HE RUSHED AT HIM FIERCELY
DEAR SIR I WROTE,--"I NEVER HAVE A BATH SO THAT'S THE END OF JOHNNY MY BOY PRODIGY FOR WHOM I HAVE SUFFERED SO LONG
I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE THAT WHAT I REALLY WANT IS A VOTE HAVEN'T YOU GOT ONE
ALL MY FRIENDS WONDERED HOW I HAD BECOME SO INTIMATE WITH HIM
HE GIVES A NOD OF CONFIRMATION
THAT IF YOU REMEMBER WAS THIS FELLOW HI-YOU'S SUGGESTION
YOURS SINCERELY WELL THAT'S THE IDEA AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS
YOU LEAVE THIS TO ME HE SAID CONFIDENTIALLY
THERE HE SLEPT HIS GRIEF FORGOTTEN
IT'S THE LAST STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK WHO'LL DO CAMELS
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I SHALL WANT SOME ELOCUTION LESSONS
SO FOR SOME DAYS THE ELEVEN PODBYS GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO PLEASURE
AT THIS NEWS THE PLAYERS AT THE OTHER TABLES WOULD HASTILY LEAVE THEIR WINNINGS OR LOSINGS AND CROWD ROUND US
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YOU'VE PLAYED
I KEPT PROMISING MYSELF A SENTENCE
FROM A FULL HEART IN DAYS OF PEACE MY FELLOW-MEN RIGHTLY REGARDED ME AS MORE LIKE A BISHOP THAN A MAJOR-GEN AND NOTHING SINCE HAS MADE ME WARLIKE
RICHARD HENRY IS FOUR AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE HAS SEEN THE SEA
AND THE ANSWER SAID HERBERT OUGHT TO BE FOUR COWS BUT I KEEP ON MAKING IT EIGHT AND TUPPENCE JUST HAVE A SHOT AT IT THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW
SOMETIMES
I SAY THAT TO MYSELF DAY AND NIGHT
SIMPSON HAD MENTIONED THE SITUATION SO MANY TIMES THAT IT HAD BECOME A CATCH-PHRASE WITH US
I TOLD THEM AND THEY'RE DELIGHTED
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND WE'VE FINISHED UP THE SHOW I'M GOING TO PLANT A LEMON-PIP AND LISTEN TO IT GROW OH I'M TIRED OF THE NOISE AND THE TURMOIL OF BATTLE AND I'M EVEN UPSET BY THE LOWING OF CATTLE AND THE CLANG OF THE BLUEBELLS IS DEATH TO MY LIVER AND THE ROAR OF THE DANDELION GIVES ME A SHIVER AND A GLACIER IN MOVEMENT IS MUCH TOO EXCITING AND I'M NERVOUS WHEN STANDING ON ONE OF ALIGHTING GIVE ME PEACE
FATHER WAS SAYING FORM FOURS LEFT BEFORE GOING OFF TO FRANCE AGAIN AND MOTHER WAS BUYING WOOL TO MAKE HIM SOME MORE SOCKS
YOUR NEW BESTS SAID ARCHIE
BUT IT'S BEEN HEAVENLY WE'VE DONE LOTS OF RIVIERISH THINGS I PROTESTED
BY JOVE SAID SMITH SUDDENLY BRIGHTENING UP
HAVE I DONE WELL HE SITS NOW IN A LITTLE BASKET LINED WITH FLANNEL A HERO RETURNED FROM THE WAR
THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT
IT IS COMMON TALK THAT MY PIANOLA WAS THE CHIEF THING ABOUT ME WHICH ATTRACTED CELIA
MR MILNE IS AT PRESENT IN THE TRENCHES FACING THE GERMAN BULLETS SO THIS WILL PROBABLY BE HIS LAST BOOK YOU SEE NOW WHY AN APOLOGY IS NECESSARY
IT IS NOT A PERFECT LIKENESS
AND IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT AN INSUFFERABLE GUEST WHO NEVER GOT ASKED AGAIN WOULD OBJECT THAT THE HYMN PART WAS UNUSUAL IN REAL WARFARE
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM IN THE NEXT WORLD I DO NOT KNOW BUT IT WILL BE SOMETHING EXTREMELY HUMOROUS
AND LATE THAT AFTERNOON HER HAT AND FRINGE-NET WERE DISCOVERED BY THE EDGE OF THE WATERS
THOMAS IN SOME MAGICAL WAY HAS DISAPPEARED
HAVING REMOVED THE WORKS YOU WRAP THE EMPTY CASE UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF AND HAND IT BACK TO HIM ASKING HIM TO PUT IT IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
HE PLACED THEM ON THE WINDOW-SILL AND READ THEIR TITLES AGAIN REVERENTLY
FOR ONE WHO HAS PREFERRED TO AMASS GENERAL KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN TO SPECIALIZE IT IS CONSIDERED ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THEY STICK LIKE BILLY-O YOU HAVEN'T SPECIALIZED IN ANYTHING HAVE YOU ONLY IN WIVES CELIA SMILED AND WENT ON
WHAT'S IN IT PINK GERANIUMS AND--AND PINK GERANIUMS AND--ER PINK GERANIUMS I SUGGESTED
O MARMALADE!--I DO NOT MEAN THE SORT SWEET MARROW-PULP FOR BABES AND MAIDENS FITTER BUT THAT WHEREIN THE GOLDEN FISHES SPORT ON ORANGES SEAS WITH JUST A DASH OF BITTER NOT FALSELY COY BUT EAGER TO PARADE THEIR SOUTHERN BIRTH--IN SHORT O MARMALADE
YOU KNOW BOBBY IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR IT IT WAS NOT
I HAVE NOT USED THE WEIGHING-MACHINE SINCE
THE ICE BEING NOW BROKEN--I MEAN THE ICE BEING NOW--WELL YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN--I WAS NOW IN A POSITION TO ASK FOR SOME OF HIS ICE
THIS IS A FUNNY STORY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE IT COME TO
AN AUDIENCE SOON GETS TIRED OF A LECTURE AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE WAKEFUL ONES TO CONCENTRATE ON BUT THE WHITE WAISTCOAT OF THE LECTURER
I HAVE LEARNT TO-DAY SHE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAS A HORROR OF HIGH PLACES YOU MEAN THAT ON THE CLIFFS OF AS IT MIGHT BE BRIDLINGTON SOME SUDDEN UNBRIDLED TERROR MAY CAUSE HIM TO HURL HIMSELF YOU WILL NEVER GET HIM TO THE CLIFFS OF BRIDLINGTON
WE HAD THE LABELS ON OUR LUGGAGE 2 WE HAD LOST HEAVILY THIRTY FRANCS AT THE TABLES
AT ELEVEN THAT NIGHT I ROSE FROM MY GLANCE DECIDED THAT HERBERT'S PROBLEM WAS THE MORE IMMEDIATELY PRESSING AND TOOK IT TO BED WITH ME
DO HAVE A SHOT AT IT
COME ALONG SAMUEL SAID ARCHIE FORWARD IN OUR NEW FORMATION WE MARCHED UP SIMPSON EXCITED AND REHEARSING TO HIMSELF THE WORDS OF INTRODUCTION WE OTHERS OUTWARDLY CALM
ALL THIS PAMPERING OF THE POOR IS PLAYING THE VERY DEUCE WITH THE COUNTRY
HE WALKS QUICKLY ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE TELEPHONE AND TAKES UP THE RECEIVER IMPATIENTLY HAM
JOHN AND MARY HAD THE WORLD TO THEMSELVES
AT THAT MOMENT THE WIND DROPPED AND THE COMBATANTS WERE SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
TO A WELL I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH WILL HAVE TO COME OUT
DOUBLE-_NINE YES
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE MORTALS ARE HE LOOKED ROUND TO THEM ALL
HE FALLS BACK INTO THE THRONE AS IF DEEP IN THOUGHT AND PASSES A HAND ACROSS HIS HAIR
THE SPEECH HE USED TO MAKE WAS REVERENT BUT HEARTY
SOME DAY MY DEAR MRS CARDEW WE MUST ALL MEET AT LUNCH
THEY PASSED A LOT OF THESE FUNNY LITTLE THINGS ON THEIR WAY HERE BUT JENNY WOULDN'T STOP BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING TO SHOW HIM A CRAB A GREAT BIG ENORMOUS DARLING LITTLE CRAB--WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING--AND NOW IT'S ONLY JUST THIS
WELL I ASKED
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER FINE DAY TO-MORROW HE SAID TO CUTHBERT THE SECOND PODBY
WITH ITS AID YOU CAN CONVEY ANYTHING YOU LIKE ACROSS THE FOOTLIGHTS
SOMETIMES RICHARD TIED JASPER TO A STAKE AND SET LIGHT TO HIM
BRAVE CHADD HE SAID THOU SPEAKEST SOOTH
AS IT IS SHE DOES THE CORRESPONDENCE WHILE I GAZE INTO THE FIRE AND THINK ABOUT THINGS
I WAS EIGHT-STONE-THIRTEEN
HE WAS READY FOR HER
WE--ER--RETURN NEXT MONTH ANSWERED HERBERT
AND FOR THREE DAYS CELIA WENT ABOUT WITHOUT A WEDDING-RING AND FOR ALL I KNOW WITHOUT EVEN HER MARRIAGE-LINES IN HER MUFF
ALL AT ONCE AN IDEA STRUCK HIM AND A CRAFTY LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES
THE POOR THING WILL BE GETTING COLD HE GOT TO WORK AGAIN
HE STOOD THERE TONGUE-TIED
BUT NEXT YEAR WE ARE GOING TO PLAY FRIENDLY GOLF AGAIN
IT IS EASY IT SEEMED THE BEST WAY
I'VE NEVER WON ANYTHING AT GOLF YET AND I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE CUP ON THE DINNER-TABLE EVERY NIGHT YOU CAN'T COME TO DINNER IN CANADA EVERY NIGHT HE POINTED OUT
ALREADY TRADE IS LEAVING THE COUNTRY
UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO
WE WALKED OUT TO THE CAB-RANK TOGETHER
III OF ALL THE PRINCES WHO FROM TIME TO TIME HAD VISITED THE COURT NONE ENDEARED HIMSELF SO RAPIDLY TO THE PEOPLE AS DID FREDERICK OF MILVANIA
LET X BE THE SUBALTERN--THAT'S THE WAY
HE SHOOK MY HAND AGAIN
YOU CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE OF THE INITIALS IT'S EASY ENOUGH
WE GENERALLY STAY EXPLAINED CELIA UNTIL OUR HOST BREAKS IT TO US THAT HE CAN'T STICK US ANY LONGER NOT THAT THAT OFTEN HAPPENS I ADDED
LET ME THEN MAKE IT PERFECTLY PLAIN--I AM A SECOND LIEUTENANT
I ALWAYS HAD A FEELING THAT I WAS REALLY A BETTER GOLFER THAN HE AND THIS MADE ME FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIS GAME
I AM ANXIOUS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I HAVE JUST LEARNT ABOUT PERCY
OH DO TELL US SQUIRE SAID EVERYBODY
WELL THERE YOU ARE SAID CELIA TRIUMPHANTLY
YOU GO AS AN ORANGE AND I'LL GO AS A VERY BLUE BLUE SKY AND YOU SHALL LEAN AGAINST ME AND WE'LL DANCE THE TANGERINE SAID MYRA
AT THE SAME TIME WE WATCHED THE NEWSPAPERS ANXIOUSLY FOR DETAILS OF THE LATEST INVENTIONS
ONCE THE BILL IS THROUGH I SHALL BE PREPARED TO RETIRE IN YOUR FAVOUR
CADDIE GIVE ME MY DRIVER CADDIE THE SUN SHINES HOT BUT THERE'S HALF A BREEZE ENOUGH TO RUSTLE THE TREE-TOPS LADDIE ONLY SUPPOSING THERE WERE SOME TREES
YOU WILL SEE THIS FOR YOURSELF IF YOU CONSIDER THE PASSAGE AS IT SHOULD PROPERLY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ENTER LORD ARTHUR FLUFFINOSE
THE PORTER WITH MANY GESTICULATIONS IS STILL HURLING FRENCH AT HIM
IT MUST BE OF A VIRGIN WHITENESS
IF YOU HADN'T INTERFERED HE'D HAVE DONE IT
BUT THE EMPLOYMENT OF IT CERTAINLY ADDS AN AIR OF MYSTERY TO THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE ILLUSION AND THIS AIR OF MYSTERY IS AFTER ALL THE CHIEF STOCK-IN-TRADE OF THE SUCCESSFUL CONJURER
ANNOYED WITH MY TACTLESSNESS IN LETTING HIM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT I KICKED HUMPHREY OFF HIS STOOL
SEVEN TIMES HE CLEARED HIS THROAT AND SEVEN TIMES HE FAILED TO SPEAK
I FANCY THAT HE WORE SOMEBODY'S MILITARY SOLES WHICH PREVENT SLIPPING
FORTUNATELY THE DAILY MAIL REMAINED
YOU MUST TELL THE OTHERS THAT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO ME TO-DAY AS I WAS COMING DOWN HERE SAID THE PROFESSOR AS HE BEAMED ROUND ON THE COMPANY
FROM THAT DAY JOHNNY HAS INTERPRETED DR JOHN BULL'S FAVOURITE COMPOSITION NINE TIMES EVERY MORNING
HE WAS JUST FEELING IN HIS FIFTH POCKET WHEN BILLY CAME TO THE RESCUE
SPEND A LITTLE MORE SHE PLEADED
AT SIX ONE IS EXTRAORDINARILY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE
COMMON LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE READ THE THERMOMETER
AND WHAT HIS CHEF MAY LACK IN SKILL HIS BUTLER MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IN IMPASSIVITY
AT THIS POINT HE LOOKS AT THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK IN THE CORNER AND THE AUDIENCE FOLLOWING HIS EYES SEES THAT IT IS SEVEN MINUTES TO FOUR WHICH APPEARS DELIGHTFULLY NATURAL I CAME TO TELL LARKSPUR TO SELL BUNGOES
SHE IS ALSO FULLY QUALIFIED NOW TO HELP WITH THE HEAVY ROLLER
ONCE THERE HE TIED HIM TO A POST IN MID-STREAM AND RODE HASTILY OFF TO THE NEAREST TOWN WHERE HE SPENT THE EVENING WITNESSING THE FIRST HALF OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE MANAGER
IF I REFUSE IT WILL BE TOO LATE THEN TO GET A SUBSTITUTE
THE NEED FOR SPRINKLING OUR REMARKS WITH THOUGHTFUL WORDS LIKE ECONOMIC AND SPORADIC IS OVER FOR A BIT
NEGOTIATIONS ENSUED
IS THAT ALL ASKED THE FISHMONGER
AY SAID THE COLONEL
ON THAT NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN DAY WHEN I WENT IN FIRST WITH ARCHIE THAT SETTLES IT
O HAPPY DAY
I CANNOT AFFORD POCKET-MONEY FOR MORE THAN A DOZEN TEN SHE TOOK A FRANC FROM ME AND GAVE IT TO THE BIGGEST GIRL
CADDIE GIVE ME MY DRIVER CADDIE NOTE MY STYLE ON THE FIRST FEW TEES
MRS HERBERT SEEMED RESIGNED TO THE WORST BUT HERBERT THOUGH FAINT WAS STILL PURSUING
HOW WILL THAT SUIT YOU WITH A HEART STILL BEATING JOHN LEFT THE OFFICE FIVE MINUTES LATER AND BOUGHT A NEW BELT
CHARMING WEATHER FOR THE TIME OF YEAR FOR THE TIME OF YEAR OF COURSE SAID THE KING HASTILY
BUT THIS GALLANT FELLOW WAS THE MAN WHO--BY THE WAY LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
E FOR ER I SHOUTED
AT LEAST I ADDED LOOKING AT MY WATCH I DO KNOW
HEAVEN IT WAS WHICH CAME TO PASS WITHIN THOSE MAGIC WALLS OF GLASS THOUGH WILLIAM LIKE A SILLY ASS HAD LOST MY BAG OF BULL'S-EYES THE WONDERS OF THAT WONDER-HALL
REALLY SAID CELIA PATHETICALLY WE MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE GONE TO A HOUSE WHERE THERE WASN'T A WEIGHING-MACHINE AT ALL
BLANCHAILLE THE INSTRUCTOR THERE WILL RECEIVE YOUR FRIEND HE BOWED AND WALKED OUT
BUT YOU SHALL TELL ME WHEN YOU HAVE READ IT
I THOUGHT HE WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS THEY SAY CHEERFULLY
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER TRICK IF THEY WEREN'T CONFEDERATES
HE WOULD WRITE A NOVEL ABOUT A BOY CALLED WILLIAM WHO HAD LIVED IN CORNWALL AND WHO CAME TO LONDON AND WROTE A NOVEL A NOVEL OF WHICH THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE SAID
MR CECIL WILLOW THE WELL-KNOWN--ER--POET MR WILLOW A WELL-DRESSED YOUNG MAN FAIR AND RATHER STOUT AND A CREDIT TO ANY DRAWING-ROOM ANNOUNCES THE SUBJECT OF HIS POEM--LIBERTY
A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT EVENING AT THE SAVOY HE WAS MARRIED
AND IN THE HOSPITAL IN ENGLAND COMMON SUDDENLY SAW HIS MISTRESS AGAIN
FOR THIS REASON MAJOR I HAVE DECIDED TO ENTRUST THE NEWS TO NO ONE BUT YOURSELF
I PEDALLED THROUGH TO THE END
OH I MUST TELL YOU WHAT THAT FUNNY MR DANBY SAID
BUT I ADMIT THAT THE TRUTH IS SOMETIMES HARD TO BELIEVE AND THE FIRST SIX PERSONS TO WHOM I TOLD THE STORY ASSURED ME FRANKLY THAT I WAS A LIAR
CELIA I SAID AT TEA I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER I OUGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR GENEROSITY WHAT GENEROSITY IN LETTING ME DELIVER THIS LECTURE IT ISN'T GENEROSITY IT'S SWANK
TREADING LIGHTLY ON THE SWAYING WIRE HE CARRIED HYACINTH ACROSS TO THE HOUSE OPPOSITE
DEAR OLD CHAP WE THOUGHT YOU WERE IN ENGLAND
AS SHAKESPEARE IS REVERED NOW MY HALF-MILLION AUTOGRAPHS SCATTERED SO LAVISHLY ON CHARGE-SHEETS PASSES CHITS REQUISITIONS INDENTS AND APPLICATIONS WOULD KEEP THE PRICE AT A DEAD LEVEL OF ABOUT TEN A PENNY
BUT AT OTHER TIMES AS FOR INSTANCE WHEN I WAS SEMAPHORING THEY WERE VERY FAR APART
TWO SLIM BROWN LEGS EMERGE TO BEAR THE BURDEN AND ONE FEELS THAT IF SHE FELL OVER SHE WOULD HAVE TO STAY THERE UNTIL SOMEBODY PICKED HER UP
ON THE NEXT MORNING I HAPPENED TO DROP IN AT HERBERT'S OFFICE
IT WOULD BE ROBBERY
EXCELLENT
WE'RE ALL WORRYING ABOUT ONE WHICH FATHER SAW IN A PAPER
HE DIED WITHOUT THE O.B.E
AND THEN JASPER WITH ONE BLOW OF HIS PALM HURLED HIS ADVERSARY OVER THE PRECIPICE
BUT TO GET IT I HAD TO DISENTANGLE ALGERNON FIRST AND I HAD NO HAND AVAILABLE
I WAS--I WAS TALKING TO A PIG LAUGHED THE KING
WE WENT BACK TO ENGLAND
SIMPSON FELL OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE OF IT OH POOR SAMUEL YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU GAVE HIM THE TOP BERTH I ASKED IN SURPRISE
THAT IF YOU SUDDENLY FOUND YOU'D LEFT YOUR PIPE BEHIND IT WOULD BE ROTTEN
ISN'T IT A LOVELY THE COOK-HOUSEKEEPER MAJESTIC BUT KINDLY CAME FORWARD WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND WELCOMED HIM VOLUBLY--IN FRENCH
LOOMS AHEAD TRAGEDY
NO MOSS NOW IF YOU'D ONLY ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT GARDENING--YOU SEE THE PROVERB WE WANTED TO HAVE FIRST OF ALL WAS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULDN'T THROW STONES ONLY THROW WAS SO DIFFICULT
A QUESTION OF LIGHT AS SOON AS CELIA HAD GOT A CHEQUE-BOOK OF HER OWN AND I HAD EXPLAINED THE MYSTERIES OF CO TO HER SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR A SAFE INVESTMENT OF HER BALANCE WHICH AMOUNTED TO SEVERAL POUNDS
IF ONE CAN'T SOLVE A CHESS PROBLEM BY STARTING OFF WITH THE MOST UNLIKELY-LOOKING THING ON THE BOARD ONE CAN'T SOLVE IT AT ALL
FROM THIS DISTANCE YOU CAN'T BE CERTAIN OF RECOGNIZING AN ISLAND YOU DON'T KNOW
A WEEK LATER HE PUSHED AN ELDER BROTHER OVER THE SAME CLIFF AND WAS OPENLY REFERRED TO IN THE PRESS AS THE NEXT BEARER OF THE TITLE
ANOTHER WHISKY AND SODA WAITER WE'RE GETTING FLABBY
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO
HE KNEW IT INSTINCTIVELY
LET'S PLAY PROVERBS I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT SAID HERBERT
AND NOW HERE HE WAS AT TWENTY-SIX IN THE LITTLE BED-SITTING-ROOM IN BLOOMSBURY READY TO WRITE THE GREAT NOVEL WHICH SHOULD TAKE LONDON BY STORM
BUT IT WAS NOT GRANTED
IN THIS WORLD HOWEVER HE IS TO HAVE ALL THAT HE WANTS
JASPER HAD LEAPT WITH HIS FAIR BURDEN UPON THE BACK OF HIS MUSTANG AND WAS GONE
THERE THEY ARE OVER THERE
THE LESS SAID ABOUT POODLES THE BETTER
THE ARTICLE WHICH FOLLOWS IS NOT REALLY ONE'S OWN FOR THE WRETCHED FELLOW WHO WROTE THE BOOK IS ALWAYS TRYING TO PUSH HIS WAY IN WITH HIS VIEWS ON MATRIMONY OR THE SUSSEX DOWNS OR WHATEVER HIS RIDICULOUS SUBJECT IS
FOR AN HOUR HE WRESTLED WITH THE PROBLEM AND THEN HE HAD ANOTHER INSPIRATION
BOTH DOING WELL BUT PERHAPS THAT IS UNNECESSARY NOW
LET US I TOOK OUT MY WATCH SUDDENLY
THE EGG
NOW IN A FEW DAYS HUMPH SAID FREDERICK AGAIN
THE AFFAIR BEGAN IN A TAXICAB TWO YEARS AGO
THEN THE HOUSE BEHIND HIM CRUMBLES TO THE GROUND WITH THE WICKED JASPER IN ITS RUINS
SO HE CAME TO SEE HIS FIRST GERMAN DUG-OUT AND TO GET A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DEAD BLEACHED LAND AND THE GREAT WORK WHICH AWAITED HIM THERE
I WONDER WHY NOT
SO I LOSE THIRTY SHILLINGS BY IT
VIVE LA FRANCE SHE ANSWERS PAS UN LIT AND YOU GO TO THE NEXT HOUSE
WE'RE ALL WAITING AND YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR APOLOGY RIGHT AWAY SIMPSON TOOK A DEEP BREATH AND BEGAN
THE FIRST TEE MULLION IT IS THE PLACE IT IS THE PLACE MY SOUL
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS SAYS THAT HE IS VERY PROUD TO MEET SO DISTINGUISHED A MONARCH AS YOUR MAJESTY DID HE SAY THAT ASKED THE KING SURPRISED
BUT IT MAY WELL BE THAT THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY OF GETTING THE FIRST CHARACTER ON HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL OF JOHN'S EMOTION WHEN HE SAW HIS FIRST PROOFS AND OF THE PRINTER'S EMOTION WHEN HE SAW WHAT A MESS JOHN HAD MADE OF THEM
I TURNED YOU OUT OF THE REGIMENT THREE WEEKS AGO
THE OLD CLAY HUT STILL STOOD PROUDLY AMID THEM
FIRE
THE FIRST MONTH OF INSTRUCTION WENT BY
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE TO--OH IT'S ALL RIGHT I THINK I'VE GOT IT I SHAN'T TRY TO LOOK HANDSOME THIS TIME SAID ARCHIE
A LITTLE LATER HE CAME UP WITH A SMILE
ON A DATE SIX MONTHS AHEAD THE TWO COMBATANTS WOULD MEET THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LITTLE TOWN IN WHICH THEY LIVED AND FIGHT TO THE DEATH
THEY LEAVE THE DEAD CRAB THERE AND HURRY BACK
ONE DAY CELIA CAME TO ME IN GREAT EXCITEMENT
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE PROUD FATHER HOWEVER HAD FAILED TO REVEAL ANYTHING MORE STIRRING THAN I LOVE MUMMY AND--ER--SO ON
HOWEVER HE REFUSED TO FALL IN
I ASK A FEE OF TEN GUINEAS
BUT I AM BROWN A STRANGER ALL UNKNOWN TO MRS PHIPP AS SHE TO ME A COMMON INTERLOPER--I SEE IT NOW--AN UNINVITED GUEST WHOSE CARD WAS CLEARLY MEANT FOR MR BROWNIE
HE HAD ONLY MET HER ONCE AND THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AT HIS NATIVE POLWOLLOP
SING TRIANGLE
NOBODY NOTICED THEM
I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE EXPLAINED A STYMIE OR A NO-BALL VERY CLEVERLY ONCE
FOR DICK HAVING BEEN ORDERED BY THE CAPTAIN NOT TO STRAIN HIMSELF BY TRYING TO BOWL IS NOT GOING TO TRY
THERE I MUST GET ON WITH MY WORK WENT ON THE COLONEL SITTING DOWN AT HIS TABLE AND TURNING OVER HIS PAPERS
CORRECT ME IF YOU DON'T AGREE BUT ONE OF YOU WANTS WHAT SAID HE AND GEORGE AUGUSTUS CHADD SAID ME MEANING OF COURSE THAT HE DID
WHEN I FIRST BECAME A SECOND LIEUTENANT I WAS RATHER PROUD
JUST A MOMENT ORDERLY SAID THE MAJOR
ONE DAY HE INFORMED JESSIE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO HIS WORK IN LONDON AND THAT IT MIGHT BE A YEAR OR MORE BEFORE HE COULD ACKNOWLEDGE HER OPENLY AS HIS WIFE TO HIS RICH AND PROUD PARENTS
HAVE YOU TRIED IT WITH AN X OF COURSE YES IT LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WANTS A BIT OF AN X SOMEWHERE
THEN IF YOU NIP OUT AND GET A PORTER I CAN HAND THE BAGS OUT TO HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW ALL RIGHT SAYS THOMAS
THE DRAMATIST WISHED US TO KNOW THE THOUGHTS WHICH WERE PASSING THROUGH HAMLET'S MIND AND IT WAS THE ONLY WAY HE COULD THINK OF IN WHICH TO DO IT
I DROVE A LONG ONE THE LONGEST OF THE DAY SLIGHTLY HOOKED
LADY MARY KNEW
WHEN WAS MAGNA CHARTA SIGNED PROBABLY SHE SAYS THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
YOU MUST PUT ON MORE FLESH HE SAYS STERNLY RUNNING HIS PENCIL UP AND DOWN THEM AGAIN
ON THE DAY WHEN I FIRST PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER CELIA SWORE AN OATH THAT NOTHING BUT DEATH EXTREME POVERTY OR BRIGANDS SHOULD EVER REMOVE IT
BE CAREFUL FORTY-FIVE HE SAID
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT I SAID
I HAVE NO REAL RIGHT TO TOBY
IT WAS NATURAL THEN THAT HAVING LITTLE IN COMMON WITH HIS OTHER HUNDRED AND FORTY CHARGES HI-YOU SHOULD FIND HIMSELF DRAWN INTO EVER CLOSER COMPANIONSHIP WITH FREDERICK
I MAKE IT THIRTEEN--ALL THESE THIRTEEN ARE OURS IS VERY INSPIRING
HE'S IN THE LIBRARY
OF COURSE WENT ON AMARIL I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR LOVING SUBJECTS WOULD SAY ABOUT IT MY LOVING SUBJECTS SAID THE KING GRIMLY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY BROUGHT UP
A LITTLE PARTY AT THE SAVOY--HIS BIRTHDAY YOU KNOW
PASS THE VISITORS BOOK AND LET'S GET IT OVER NO YOU DON'T SAID BLAKE SNATCHING IT AWAY FROM ME THAT'S FOR THE GENERAL THIS WAY SIR SAID A VOICE ABOVE AND DOWN CAME BILLY FOLLOWED BY THE BRIGADIER
THE OTHER LOOKED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
HE WAS POOR AND HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HYACINTH
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
H'SH SHE SAYS FOR THERE IS ANOTHER VERSE TO COME
THERE WAS A HURRICANE IN THE HALL
AND IF YOU DON'T FIND YOUR BALL IN THIRTY SECONDS YOU LOSE THE HOLE IT WAS INGENIOUS BUT THE MOTHER COUNTRY CAN BE INGENIOUS TOO
THESE NUMBERS THEY SHOW TO THE OTHER GUESTS
BUT I HAVE INVENTED A SORT OF SYSTEM FOR ROULETTE WHICH WE MIGHT THERE'S ONLY ONE SYSTEM WHICH IS ANY GOOD PRONOUNCED ARCHIE
SOMETIMES JASPER SEALED RICHARD IN A BARREL AND PUSHED HIM OVER NIAGARA
YOUR FRIENDS MUST BE VERY FOND OF YOU TO HAVE LENT YOU THIS LOVELY PLACE NOT FONDER THAN WE ARE SAID MYRA SMILING AT HIM
WHEN I RAGGED HIM ABOUT IT HE TRIED TO EAT MY ANKLES
1922 TO OWEN SEAMAN AFFECTIONATELY IN MEMORY OF NINE HAPPY YEARS AT THE PUNCH OFFICE CONTENTS CHAPTER INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION I
NO YOU DON'T I SAID
AMID MURMURS OF YOU'LL PLAY FIELD-MARSHAL AND AUCTION ARCHBISHOP THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE
ONE SOON PICKS IT UP NO DOUBT
YOU CAN'T DO MUCH WITH JUST WATTLES AND A LITTLE SHERBET--I MEAN YOU CAN'T EXPECT THE PUBLIC TO BE INTERESTED IN PERSIA AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
MEANWHILE HE DID NOT DARE TO REPUDIATE ME
HE FELT IT DEEPLY
ANDREW WAS OUT BUT A NOTE LYING ON HIS STUDY CARPET MEET ME AT THE OLD WINDMILL TO-NIGHT GAVE HIM A CLUE
BEFORE LUNCH DON'T ALL BE SO SILLY SMILED DAHLIA
BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HIS PROFESSION FAILED HIM
WERE APPEARANCES NOT SO DECEPTIVE ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT LORD BLIGHT BLIGHT AS HE WAS KNOWN FAMILIARLY TO HIS FRIENDS WAS A MAN TO BE ENVIED
YOU AREN'T REALLY MORE BEAUTIFUL WITHOUT IT HE SAID
WHY SHOULD THEY TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT IT'S OUR DUTY TO LISTEN ALWAYS I ROSE WITH DIGNITY
ARMY FORM BOOK 136 WAS HANDED TO ME
SO NOW IT GOES OFF AND ON JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RING
T FOR TWO
LIBERTY THERE WERE TWO THRUSHES IN A TREE THE ONE WAS TAMED THE OTHER FREE
ALAS
ALAS
HOT THOUGH IT WAS I WOULD WALK
NOR IS IT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE PLOT OF THE PIECE HINGES ON HIM AND THAT WITHOUT HIM THE DRAMA WOULD LANGUISH
BUT THERE IS STILL ANOTHER WAY OF AVOIDING THE SOLILOQUY WHICH IS SOMETIMES USED WITH GOOD RESULTS
AS TIME IS SO SHORT I HAVE ASKED DAHLIA AND ARCHIE TO MEET ME THERE AND IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU HAVE GONE OUT WE SHALL WAIT TILL YOU COME BACK
A PEKINESE IS NOT A PET DOG
THE SUCCESSFUL PLAYWRIGHT IS INDEED A MAN TO BE ENVIED
SHE TOOK IT AND READ SLOWLY AND WONDERINGLY THESE WORDS TO LAWN-MOWER AS DELIVERED L5 17S
ONLY EVERY NOW AND THEN I FIND MYSELF THINKING THE MOST OBVIOUS THOUGHTS WE ALL DO I ANSWERED AS I STROKED MY LIMPET GENTLY
AND WHAT'S THAT THERE
GOT THAT I TURNED TO CELIA
FREDERICK FOR THIS WAS THE NAME WHICH HE HAD GIVEN TO IT SHARED THEIR FOOD THEIR SLEEPING APARTMENTS MUCH INDEED AS DID HI-YOU BUT HE LIVED OR SO IT SEEMED TO THE OTHER AN INNER LIFE OF HIS OWN
M
M
PERCY THE YOUNGEST THOUGH HARDLY OF AN AGE TO APPRECIATE THE MECHANISM OF IT WAS ALLOWED TO PUSH THE LAWN-MOWER
RICARDO HARRINGTONI THE WONDERFUL NEW ACROBAT OF WHOM EVERYBODY WAS TALKING STOOD HIGH ABOVE THE CROWD ON HIS PLATFORM
HOWEVER I COPIED DOWN THE POSITION AND SAID I'D GLANCE AT IT
IT IS EXTREMELY DOUBTFUL WHETHER BOBBY WILL APPROVE OF MY ACTION WHILE IF HE OR PHYLLIS SHOULD BY AN UNLUCKY ACCIDENT GET ME OUT I SHOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT
NOR DID HE PAUSE TILL HE ARRIVED AT THE COLONEL'S DUG-OUT
I EXPECT IT'S BECAUSE OF MY ELECTRIC LIGHTS
AND TO HIS AMAZEMENT HE DISCOVERS THAT THE WORKS IN SOME MYSTERIOUS WAY HAVE GOT BACK INTO HIS WATCH AND THAT THE HANDKERCHIEF IN WHICH IT WAS WRAPPED UP HAS GONE
THEY WOULD REALIZE THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT DOWN THERE ON BUSINESS
IT MUST BE VERY DULL TO BE ON THE FOURTH FLOOR WITH ONLY EIGHT FLIPPERTIES UNBEARABLE TO BE ON THE FIRST WITH ONLY TWO O-OH HOW FAS_-CINATING SAID CELIA
AT LEAST HE WAS JUST BEGINNING WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP HE APPLIED ANOTHER MATCH TO HIS PIPE AND WENT ON AS IF THE IDEA HAD SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY HIS INTERNAL SYSTEM HE MEANT
A HUE-AND-CRY WAS RAISED POLICE WHISTLES WERE BLOWN AND RICHARD HARRINGTON MR BELLINGHAM'S PRIVATE SECRETARY WAS SMARTLY ARRESTED
HOW DO YOU DO
HE'S ASLEEP THAT'S WHY WE NEED NOT HAVE HURRIED RICHARD HENRY SAYS NOTHING
NOW THIS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE ANNOYED CAPTAIN TOMSK
WAR-TIME V
BUT IF IT'S NOT YOU SHE FALTERED IT WILL BE SOMEBODY ELSE NO
HE WAS GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN VERY VERY SERIOUS OVER THIS TERRIBLE BUSINESS BUT THAT FOR HER SAKE HE WAS WEARING THE MASK
THAT BEING SO I MAY REFER TO HIS ANCESTORS ALWAYS AN OBJECT OF VENERATION AMONG THESE EASTERNS
AND THERE YOU ARE SAID THE GODS IN OLYMPUS
ONLY THAT MORNING HE HAD RECEIVED THE V.C
NO NO BACON THANKS
NOW I HATE POODLES
BUT NOT MY OWN
HE WILL HAVE TWO HOURS BATTING EVERY DAY AGAINST FROM A BATSMAN'S POINT OF VIEW IDEAL BOWLING AND IN ADDITION THE WHOLE-HEARTED ADMIRATION OF ALL OF US
HOW TRUE
IT DOESN'T MATTER A BIT SHE SAID REMOVING FRAGMENTS OF SHELL FROM HER LAP
I MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH SOME PRIDE AT BREAKFAST YESTERDAY
GIVE ME A THOUSAND POUNDS AND YOU SHALL HAVE THESE
SHE NODDED
THOUGH SO LITTLE WAS KNOWN OF HIM THE STORY OF HIS PROWESS WAS ON EVERY LIP
WE DROVE QUICKLY HOME
SHE BRIGHTENED AT HIS NAME SOME MEMORY CAME BACK TO HER THAT BROUGHT A HAPPY SMILE--WHY SURELY THEY WERE FRIENDS
WHAT A CHARMING DAY IS IT NOT
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE SO PROUD TO HAVE THEM ALL WITH YOU I AM PROUD OF THEM
SO I PLACED THE ROLL IN THE PIANOLA SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO PLAY
NEVER MIND THINK HOW MUCH THE BIRDIES LOVE IT
OR WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE SOME MUSHROOM SPAWN
THE STAGE TEA OF WHICH A SECOND CUP IS ALWAYS REFUSED
MILNE AUTHOR OF IF I MAY THE DOVER ROAD MR PIM PASSES BY ETC
ALSO YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A GOLF COURSE LESS THAN TWO MILES AWAY
NO I SAID TO BE OR NOT TO BE
HE HAS LEFT AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT ON HIS TABLE AND I DO NOT LIKE TO LEAVE THE ROOM UNOCCUPIED CERTAINLY SIR SAID LORD SMITH
AS SOON AS THE INFORMATION LEAKED OUT I SENT UP A HASTY PRAYER FOR BIRD-SILENCE UNTIL WE HAD GOT HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE PLACE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL IDEA I THINK WASN'T IT SUBLIME ANSWERS THE NEIGHBOUR
NAMES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
AT THE TIME OUR FILM BEGINS TO UNWIND HE WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY IN THE CITY A WIDOWER AND THE FATHER OF A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF EIGHTEEN CALLED HYACINTH
SHE WAS FIVE
BUT IT MAY WELL BE THAT LORD LARKSPUR HAS AN INTRIGUE OF HIS OWN WITH HIS SECRETARY MISS DEVEREUX AND IF THEIR BIG SCENE IS TO TAKE PLACE ON THE STAGE TOO THE HALL HAS GOT TO BE CLEARED FOR THEM IN SOME WAY
HOW VERY DELIGHTFUL
THE STORY THAT WENT WEST WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A WAR STORY SAID CELIA ONE AUTUMN DAY WHEN THAT SORT OF STORY WAS POPULAR
IF I AGREE TO LECTURE AT ALL IT WILL BE SIMPLY BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I HAVE A MESSAGE TO DELIVER
I HAD ALREADY GRASPED THE FACT THAT THE TITLE OF MY DISCOURSE WAS THE IMPORTANT THING
THE RHODODENDRONS WERE ABLAZE BENEATH THE SOUTH WINDOWS
I KNOW A LADY OF PEDIGREE WHO ASKED SOME SOLDIERS OUT TO TEA AND SAID DEAR ME AND YES I SEE AND SHE--THANK GOD!--HAS THE O.B.E
IN SHORT FREDERICK WAS A SOULFUL PIG
THE BEST OFFICER WHO EVER FORMED A FOUR AT BRIDGE--I MEAN WHO EVER FORMED FOURS
IT IS AT THE TOP OF THE HIGH CLIFF WITH AN OPEN VIEW OF THE SEA THAT I EXPRESS MYSELF BEST
POSSIBLY YOU'RE RIGHT HE SAID RELUCTANTLY
THE LITTLE DRIVE DETERMINED TO GET THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PUSHED ITS WAY STRAIGHT THROUGH AN OLD BARN AND ARRIVED AT THE DOOR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE FLAGGED LAVENDER WALK FOR THE HUMBLE WHO CAME ON FOOT
WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE
NOW FOR THE EXPLANATION OF THIS INGENIOUS ILLUSION
NO GIRL IN SOCIETY HAD BEEN MORE EAGERLY COURTED
SO DID HE
NOW I HAVE A FRENCH FRIEND HENRI ONE OF THOSE ANNOYING FRENCHMEN WHO TALK ENGLISH MUCH BETTER THAN I DO AND HENRI FOR SOME EXTRAORDINARY REASON HAD SEEN MY REVIEW
PROCEED IT WASN'T THE MOST PLEASANT OF OUR GAMES
YOU SEE I'VE GOT TO GET IN MOSS I THOUGHT IT WAS CAMELS SAID CELIA CARELESSLY
HE'S RATHER BUCKED WITH HIMSELF
ANYWAY WE HAD A VERY PLEASANT LUNCH AND ARRANGED TO PLAY GOLF TOGETHER ON THE NEXT DAY
JOHN PENQUARTO--OF COURSE
I WANT DOUBLE-NINE TWO--HAL-_LO
MY FRIEND HE WROTE THE HATRED OF YOU WHICH I NURSE IN MY BOSOM AND WHICH FILLS ME WITH THE DESIRE TO PURGE YOU FROM THE SKY IS IN DANGER OF BEING TRANSFERRED TO MY INSTRUCTOR
THEN WE SAID GOOD-BYE TO OUR PIANOLA FEELING A REVERENCE FOR IT WHICH WE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE
TOBY HE SAID GENTLY TO HIMSELF DOESN'T LIKE CLEAN-SHAVEN OFFICERS THIS HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME
I AM HIS FRIEND
THE MYSTERIOUS PUDDING IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST POPULAR ILLUSIONS
IS THIS SEAT AN EXHIBIT OR IS IT MEANT FOR SITTING ON IT'S AN EXHIBIT BUT WE MIGHT EASILY WANT TO BUY ONE SOME DAY WHEN OUR WINDOW-BOX GETS BIGGER
FOR IT MIGHT BE THAT LOST IN THE CONFUSION OF THAT ONE WILD RUSH THE MAGIC LETTER WOULD START ON ITS WAY--_FLIPPERTY--FLIPPERTY_--TO THE NEVER-LAND AND WE SHOULD FOREVER HAVE MISSED IT
I'M GOING TO GET THE SISTER IDEA INTO HIS HEAD IF I DIE FOR IT JUST A MOMENT SIR SAID THE DAZED VOICE OF THE PORTER
LOOK HERE WHICH OF YOU IS ANSWERING THE QUESTION I AM SAID CELIA FIRMLY
AFTER ANOTHER MONTH THE NEED OF A FURTHER STIMULANT WAS FELT
THE TACTFUL THING TO DO WOULD BE TO BUY A PINT OR TWO OF LAUDANUM FIRST AND THEN HAVING ESTABLISHED PLEASANT RELATIONS ASK HIM AS A FRIEND TO LEND ME HIS GREEN BOTTLE FOR A BIT
MEREDITH--I MEAN--WELL IT'S SIMPLY--(_AFTER A PAUSE WONDERFUL YOU SEE MEREDITH THERE MOST Y-YES
A WEEK LATER THE PODBY FAMILY HAD BEEN THINNED DOWN TO FIVE AND THE SEVENTEENTH EARL OF BLIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO REGAIN HIS USUAL EQUANIMITY
THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE WAS COMPLETE
BUT THAT WOULD BE TO FORGET THE BUTLER AND THE THREE FOOTMEN
REALIZING THAT HE COULD EXPECT LITTLE HELP FROM OTHERS HE DECIDED TO PUSH FOR HIMSELF
I KNOW A LOVELY TIN OF POTTED GROUSE SAID CELIA AND SHE WENT OFF TO CUT SOME SANDWICHES
YOU AREN'T GOING TO WASTE IT ARE YOU IF YOU SIMPLY LOVED IT IT WASN'T WASTED BUT I WANT EVERYBODY ELSE--COULDN'T YOU USE IT IN THE REVUE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING A REVUE AT THIS TIME FOR A CERTAIN IMPRESARIO
THERE CAME A TIME WHEN VALISES WERE LEFT BEHIND AND LIFE FOR A FORTNIGHT HAD TO BE SUSTAINED ON A PACK
NOW WE'RE OFF
WHAT ENGLAND WANTS HE SAID LEANING BACK AND PUFFING AT HIS CIGAR,--"WHAT ENGLAND WANTS IS A WAR
IT WAS WRITTEN ROUND THE JOKE WHOSE BRIGHT BEAMS LIKE A PERFECT JEWEL IN A PERFECT SETTING--HOWEVER I SAID ALL THAT TO CELIA AT THE TIME
WITH A GRIM LOOK ON HIS FACE HE TOOK OUT HIS NIBLICK
WE BESIEGED THEM WITH QUESTIONS AS SOON AS THEY APPEARED
WE WENT ON TO THE LOGGIA AGAIN AND SHE POINTED TO A LITTLE HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN BY OLIVE-TREES IN A CORNER OF THE GARDEN BELOW US
I'D BETTER HAVE MY HANDS FREE HE SAYS AND STRAPS THE CAMERA AND THE GOLF-CLUBS ON TO HIMSELF
I PUT THE BLOCK OF ICE DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT UNWRAPPED THE LOBSTER PUT THE LOBSTER NEXT TO THE ICE SPREAD ITS DAILY MAIL OUT LIFTED THE ICE ON TO THE PAPER AND--LOOKED UP AND SAW MRS THOMPSON APPROACHING
BUT HE COULD ONLY SAY THIS SO LONG AS THE OTHERS WERE IN A POSITION TO OFFER THE CONGRATULATIONS
I'VE GOT HIM MOVING NOW
WE HALTED A MOMENT OUT OF SIGHT OF THE LADIES ABOVE AND CONSIDERED OURSELVES
CHEVALIER SIMPSON PALE BUT CONTROLLED WOULD THEN PLACE HIS MONEY ON SEVENTEEN--"_DIX-SEPT HE WOULD SAY TO THE CROUPIER TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR--AND THE BALL WOULD BE SPUN
THE HOUR
SUDDENLY AN IDEA OCCURS TO HIM
AND IN ANY CASE THERE ARE REASONS SPECIAL REASONS WHY I RIDE TOBY--REASONS OF WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING HERE ARE THE REASONS 1
THE NEWS THAT I AM PREPARING A COLLECTION OF INTERESTING AND TRICKY PROBLEMS FOR A NEW ENCYCLOPAEDIA HAS GOT ABOUT AMONG MY FRIENDS
LEFT TO ITSELF YOUR INVITATION FROM THE DUCHESS TO LUNCH NEXT TUESDAY IS NO LONGER A MATTER TO WORRY ABOUT BY WEDNESDAY MORNING
THAT WAS TRAGEDY NOT COMEDY
FROM THE LOOK OF HIM IT WILL BE TOUCH AND GO WHETHER HE PULLS IT OFF
WE HAD A FORTNIGHT'S LEAVE A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING SOME ON
SEVERAL TIMES WHEN YOU'VE BEEN STANDING ON THE HEIGHTS AND CALLING ATTENTION TO THE BEAUTIFUL VIEW BELOW I'VE SAID TO MYSELF ONE PUSH AND HE'S A DEADER BUT SOMETHING SOME MYSTERIOUS AGENCY WITHIN HAS KEPT ME BACK ALL THE FELLOWS AT THE CLUB SIMPSON IS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO A FLEET STREET TOILET AND HAIRDRESSING CLUB WHERE FOR THREE GUINEAS A YEAR HE GETS SHAVED EVERY DAY AND HAS HIS HAIR CUT WHENEVER MYRA INSISTS
HAVEN'T AN IDEA SAID ARCHIE I WANTED TO BRING A REVOLVER IN CASE IT WAS ANYTHING REALLY DESPERATE BUT DAHLIA WOULDN'T LET ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL TOO I SAID IF IT TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING MERELY FUTILE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HURT MY SAMUEL HOWEVER FUTILE IT IS SAID MYRA
IT WILL BE QUITE INEXPENSIVE
ON PROBATION OF COURSE ON MY LEFT SLEEVE I WORE ANOTHER STAR
II
HE LETS ME CALL HIM FREDERICK HE ADDED TO THE KING
LET US GET ON MORE QUICKLY
HE STILL HAS HIS SUSPICIONS CELIA DROPPED INTO SILENCE
O PIOUS YOUTH
WHEN SHE CAME BEFORE SHE HAD TO LEAVE THEM BEHIND MUCH TO THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT
HE ASKED ME TO DINE WITH HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK
HE DREW IT FROM BENEATH HIM AND FOUND IT WAS AN EXTREMELY MASSIVE AND QUITE NEW SILVER CIGAR-CASE
ON MY RIGHT SLEEVE I HAD A SINGLE STAR
THE WHOLE AFFAIR WILL PROBABLY BORE YOU TO TEARS
OPEN FIREPLACES
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY IT MYSELF THEN IN THAT CASE I HAVE THE HONOUR TO RESIGN THE MESS PRESIDENCY NOTHING DOING OLD BOY
O JAFFA FOR EXAMPLE O THE DEVIL LET BEEF AND BUTTER ROLLS AND RABBITS FADE BUT GIVE ME BACK MY LOVE MY MARMALADE
IF THE BOMBING OFFICER RODE TOBY I SHOULD SHAVE AGAIN TO-MORROW AND THEN WHERE WOULD THE BATTALION BE
I FIND I AM WRONG SAYS OUR HOST
AND THE FARMER FOR WHOM JOHN SCARED ROOKS HAD SAID THICCY LA-AD SEEMS DAFT-LIKE AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF MRS PENQUARTO'S FRIENDS HAD GIVEN SIMILAR TESTIMONY
HER NEXT QUESTION SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LEFT THE POOL FOR A MOMENT
I GAVE A DEEP SIGH
SERGEANT HE SAID WE'RE ON THE EVE OF FATHER'S BIRTHDAY
YOU MAY STILL COUNT ON ME FOR THAT AND THEN THE EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED
IS IT BECAUSE HER STAYS ARE TOO TIGHT
NOT MIZPAHS RIGHT I SAID
YOU SEE WHAT HE MEANT
THAT DOES IT I SAID TO MYRA
IT WAS A GOOD REVIEW AND THE EDITOR WAS PLEASED ABOUT IT
THE STAGE CUTLET WHICH IS REMOVED WITH THE CONNIVANCE OF THE GUEST AFTER TWO MOUTHFULS
AND TO PUT HIM AT HIS EASE AGAIN WENT ON ARE YOU INTERESTED IN LITTLE PROBLEMS AT ALL HERBERT WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTED EVEN IN A PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM JUST THEN EMERGED FROM HIS APOLOGIES AND SWORE THAT HE WAS
IT IS THE BOOK OF ALL OTHERS WHICH LOSES BY TRANSLATION OF COURSE I AGREED
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A NICE AMOUNT ABOUT ANOTHER STONE SAID CELIA
IT'S SECOND LIEUTENANTS BEING LIEUTENANTS YOU'RE JOKING ON A VERY GRAVE SUBJECT I SAID SERIOUSLY
SUCH A SWEET IDEA SAYS LADY POLDOODLE
COME ALONG SAID THOMAS TO SIMPSON LET'S GO AND LOOK AT IT AFTER LUNCH CLEAN AND WELL-FED AND HAPPY WE LAY IN DECK-CHAIRS ON THE LOGGIA AND LOOKED LAZILY DOWN AT THE MEDITERRANEAN
YOU DID HAVE A CHOICE
THE WARDERS WERE OFF GUARD FOR A MOMENT
MEANWHILE HERBERT HAS FORGOTTEN BOTH THE PROBLEM AND THE GIRL
SIMPSON IS A LITTERATEUR OF SOME EMINENCE BUT LITTLE CIRCULATION COMBINING ON THE CORNET INTENSE WIND-POWER WITH NO EXECUTION AND ON THE GOLF COURSE AN ENDLESS ENTHUSIASM WITH ONLY AN OCCASIONAL CONTACT
WE JUMPED UP
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT
LETTERS PASSED
AFTER LUNCH AN EXTREMELY BRISK LITTLE MAN TOOK HER IN HAND
GOOD OLD DOG AND SO ON
SO I'LL GO OUT FIRST NOW THEN SAID CELIA WHEN THE DOOR WAS SAFELY CLOSED WHAT SHALL WE HAVE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THIS GAME AND YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF THINKING OF A PROVERB WHICH HAS NO MOSS OR STABLE-DOORS OR GLASSHOUSES IN IT
TO THOSE INURED TO WAR'S ALARMS I NEED NOT DWELL UPON THE CHARMS OF RAW RECRUITS WHEN SLOPING ARMS NOR TELL WHY CHADD WAS HOPING THAT IF HIS SLOPING-POWERS INCREASED THEY'D GIVE HIM TWO DAYS LEAVE AT LEAST TO JOIN HIS FATHER'S BIRTHDAY FEAST
BINGO'S PEDIGREE IS FULL OF NAMES LIKE LI HUNG CHANG AND SUN YAT SEN
RICHARD HARRINGTON FOR IT WAS HE WAS TROUBLED
AND AT LAST TAKING THE RELUCTANT HUMPHREY BY THE EAR HE DRAGGED HIM LABORIOUSLY BENEATH THE SOFA
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING I COULD THINK OF
GOOD IDEA SIMPSON WAS ALL OVER HIMSELF WITH BON-HOMMY
MY SINS HAVE FOUND ME OUT NOT SINS SHE SAID GENTLY
NO ONE IS FONDER OF OUR--ONE TWO THREE
THIS WILL BE NEWS FOR HER ROYAL HIGHNESS SO LEAVING THE REST OF THE HERD TO LOOK AFTER ITSELF AS IT WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING FREDERICK AND HI-YOU WENT TO THE PALACE
HOW SHALL I DO IT?"--WELL I COULDN'T HELP YOU
WELL HE HAS A RIVAL
AT LEAST IT APPEALS TO ME
THIS ALONE JUSTIFIED THE JOURNEY 3 MYRA HAD SAT NEXT TO A PRINCE AT LUNCH
NO WONDER THE OLD GENTLEMAN DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM
OTHERS WERE ASKING EACH OTHER IF THEY HAD READ WILLIAM TREWULLIAM YET AND LYING ABOUT IT OTHERS AGAIN WERE MAKING FOR THE BUFFET
IT IS TRUE THAT THE EGGS ARE MORE SPECKLED BUT BLESS MY SOUL SAID THE AUTHORITY BUT IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE WAS SHAKEN I SHOULD THINK I KNOW A CHIFF-CHAFF WHEN I HEAR ONE AH BUT DO YOU KNOW A BLACKMAN'S WARBLER
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD MY THOUGHTS DWELT NATURALLY ON PROMOTION
IT WAS A STUPENDOUS IDEA
WHAT YOUR COUNTRY OUGHT TO DO--_(HE FINISHES HIS REMARKS IN THE LIP-LANGUAGE WHICH THE UNNAMED GENTLEMAN SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND
I WANT I SAID A WEDDING-RING ENGRAVED AND I FELT IN MY POCKETS
GOING TO SEE A CRAB HE ANNOUNCES
ROUND HIS NECK HE WEARS THE REGIMENTAL COLOURS AND ON HIS CHEST WILL BE SEWN WHATEVER MEDAL IS GIVEN TO THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED FAITHFULLY ON THE WESTERN FRONT
A TABLES STAFF
ORANGES AND LEMONS I
I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE GIRL WHO HAD PROMISED TO REMEMBER IN CASE SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE ALSO WAS SILENT
MAY I BEG YOU THEREFORE TO SEE THAT YOUR CHILD IS TAUGHT A NEW TUNE IMMEDIATELY SEEING THAT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM HAS LOST ITS FIRST FRESHNESS FOR THE TENANTS ABOVE HIM HIS REPLY TO THIS CAME TO-DAY
OR ONLY BECAUSE HER SECOND SON THE ENGINEER IS DYING OF CANCER
FOR A STAGE DINNER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GENUINE SPONGE-CAKE HAS TO BE MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE FISH CHICKEN OR CUTLET
FATHER CRIED ROSAMUND BLOWHARD SPARE HIM
I HEAR FROM MR CAREY SHE WROTE THAT YOU'RE KEEN ON PROBLEMS
AND EVEN THEN I AM DOUBTFUL
HASTILY LIFTING HIS PICKAXE MANAGER
BUT WE WERE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW FURTHER PROOF
ZERO SAID ARCHIE
ALTHOUGH HE HAD HELD HIS COMMISSION FOR THREE YEARS HE HAD ONLY BEEN ARRESTED TWICE BY THE PROVOST-MARSHAL--THE FIRST TIME FOR WEARING A SOFT CAP WHEN AS AN OFFICER AND GENTLEMAN HE SHOULD HAVE WORN A HARD ONE AND THE SECOND TIME THREE MONTHS LATER FOR WEARING A HARD CAP WHEN AS AN OFFICER AND GENTLEMAN HE SHOULD HAVE WORN A SOFT ONE
SOMETIMES THERE WOULD BE A GLEAM OF WHITE AT THE TOP OF THE HEATHER FOR A MOMENT AND THEN IT WOULD FADE AWAY
HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US
KEEP NOTHING BACK FROM HER
AN EVENING PRESS WITHOUT CALLISTHENES
THEN WE SAW ABOVE IT CELEBRITIES OF THE PAST
HE LIKES MOUSTACHES
TO MY JOY THE BAR STAYED IN ITS DOWNWARD POSITION
THERE IS ONE SMALL POINT WHICH HAS OCCURRED TO ME
SO HUMPHREY WAS FOUND A JOB
LET US BUT BOBBY WAS GONE
AFTER A WEEK OR SO ANDREW SAW THAT IT WAS HOPELESS TO TRY TO GET A CIGAR-CASE BACK TO SCOTLAND YARD IN THIS CASUAL SORT OF WAY
AND WHEN RASH ACQUAINTANCES ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID HE USED TO SAY THAT HE WAS FOR THE BAR
ANYHOW HE WAS DOOMED WITH A SELFISH FATHER LIKE THAT
YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THAT MY DEAR I AM HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECT SAID AMARIL DUTIFULLY
WELL I MUST BE GETTING ON
GERTIE HE WENT ON DREAMILY I WISH I COULD MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND SOMETHING OF THE FASCINATION WHICH AN ARTIST FINDS IN HIS MEDIUM
THE VERY THING TO PUT THE DOCUMENT INTO AN ENVELOPE WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
AND WHAT AN AIR THEY GAVE THE ROOM
IT'S THE CHIFF-CHAFF EVERYBODY ELSE LOOKED AT ME REPROACHFULLY
I'LL LEAVE A LITTLE IN THE BANK IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS SHE SAID AND THE REST MUST GO SOMEWHERE ABSOLUTELY SAFE AND EARN ME FIVE PER CENT
WONDERFULLY WELL-CUT TUNIC THIS OF YOURS HE WENT OVER TO HIM AND UNDER PRETENCE OF EXAMINING THE CUT OF HIS TUNIC DROPPED THE ENVELOPE CAUTIOUSLY INTO ONE OF THE POCKETS
EVEN THAT ISN'T AN END OF THE TROUBLE
I SWEAR I NEVER PUT IT THERE SIR HE GASPED
HERE'S ONE I HAVE CUT OUT OF OUR LOCAL PAPER
A FEW DROPS OF THIS WILL BE INTRODUCED INTO THE WATER OF THE PUBLIC BATHS AND ALL THOSE BATHING THEREIN WILL BE HEALED A STRIKING NOTION SAID THE KING
WELL WHATEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HALLO MYRA HE SAID EAGERLY
HOW IS THIS REMARKABLE TRICK PERFORMED
I MUST HAVE YOU NOT QUITE SO HERRINGY I MADE QUITE SURE THE NEXT MORNING
THE YELLOW GLAZE
WE'D HAVE ANOTHER LITTLE HONEYMOON ALL TO OURSELVES IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE A HONEYMOON I OBJECTED
I READ THE PAPERS SAID ANNE
SO WERE THE OTHERS
I CAN TRUST YOU NOT TO DISCLOSE THIS UNTIL THE TIME IS RIPE YOU CAN TRUST ME COLONEL THEY GRASPED HANDS AND SALUTED
DID YOU HEAR THAT BILLY HE ASKED
BUT WHAT CARE I
HER FACE HAD ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF WILD INTEREST WHICH SHE WAS CERTAIN COULDN'T LAST MUCH LONGER
LAST YEAR I DIDN'T GET GOING TILL THE END OF JUNE
YOU'LL SPOIL THE PICTURE
WHILE AS FOR BLOWING THE MATCH OUT HE CAN HARDLY FAIL TO DO THAT IN ONE
YOU STICK TO IT WITH AN X AND YOU OUGHT TO DO IT
BUT I SHALL BE FIRM
OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST OH YOU MUST SAID CELIA
WHAT DO YOU WANT MY NAME IS JASPER WAS THE ANSWER AND I HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO GIVE YOU HE BENT DOWN AND HISSED YOUR FIRST WIFE IS STILL ALIVE ANDREW STARTED UP IN OBVIOUS HORROR
I CAUGHT THE 2.3 FROM TOWN
IN THE CANALS OH I JUST WONDERED SHE SAID
IT WAS FOOLISH OF ME
NAVAL PORT OF OUR DEAR ALLIES THE FRENCH
SOMETHING THAT WILL INTEREST US ALL HELPED SIMPSON
IN ANY CASE CONCEIVE ONE'S PRIDE IN REALIZING SUDDENLY THAT ONE HAS BEEN CALLED AFTER A PROVINCE AND NOT AFTER A POODLE
CHAPTER V THAT'S TORN IT I SAID TO CELIA
YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF A GOLDSMITH ARE YOU I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY GOLDSMITH LIVING--OR GOLDFISH EITHER IF IT COME TO THAT
SISTER
AND HE HELD OUT A PACKET CONTAINING THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE A PHOTOGRAPH OF JESSIE'S FATHER DIPPING A SHEEP A RECEIPTED BILL FOR A PAIR OF WHITE GLOVES SIZE 9-1/2 TWO LETTERS SIGNED YOUR OWN LOVING LITTLE ANDY PANDY AND A PEPPERMINT WITH JESS ON IT IN PINK
BLANKTOWN IS NOT ITS REAL NAME OF COURSE
AND WE HAD ARRIVED A WEEK AGO
GERTIE HE SAID FOR THAT WAS HER NAME IT IS ALL OVER
SPLENDID BUT IN THE MORNING A SURPRISE AWAITED HIM
IT IS VERY DELIGHTFUL TO HAVE A FLAT IN LONDON BUT THERE ARE TIMES IN THE SUMMER WHEN I LONG FOR A GARDEN OF MY OWN
AS THE TRAIN LEAVES MONACO HIS EXCITEMENT IS INTENSE
YOU WANTED ME SIR SAID LORD SMITH ON HIS ARRIVAL
I FORGET HIS NAME THE TELEPHONE HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE STAGE
LOYALTY MUSICAL GENIUS DETERMINATION PATIENCE INDUSTRY--NEVER BEFORE HAVE THESE QUALITIES BEEN SO FINELY UNITED IN A CHILD OF SIX
DON'T YOU THINK HE'D DO IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CHEEK TO ASK HIM GOOD LORD YOU DON'T STOP BEING A HUMAN BEING BECAUSE YOU COMMAND A BRIGADE
IN A DAY SHE WOULD SINK FROM A FIRST-RATE TO A FIFTH-RATE POWER BUT HE DIDN'T SAY HOW
I WAS HOPING--BUT IN ANY CASE COMING INTO THE WATER FROM THAT HEIGHT--WELL WELL WE MUST FACE OUR TROUBLES BRAVELY
BUT I WAS QUITE SORRY TO GO FOR I WAS GETTING INTERESTED IN THOSE SISTERS
CELIA IS EVEN MORE UPSET BY IT
THE YOUNGER CHADD WAS ALWAYS THERE TO GREET HIS FATHER AND TO SHARE HIS FATHER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
NO DOUBT IF I WERE A COAL-HEAVER BY DAY MY WIFE WOULD SEE TO THE FIRE AFTER DINNER WHILE I WROTE LETTERS
DOESN'T LADY VIOLET NONE THE LESS TRILLS WITH HAPPY LAUGHTER PRINCE VON ICHDIEN THE WELL-KNOWN AMBASSADOR LOUDLY TO AN UNNAMED GENTLEMAN
N I HAVE NO TIME TO GO INTO THESE MATTERS NOR HAVE I TIME IN WHICH TO GIVE AT LENGTH HIS LATER PRESS CUTTINGS IN WHICH THERE WAS DISPLAYED A UNANIMITY OF OPINION THAT JOHN PENQUARTO WAS NOW IN THE FRONT RANK OF LIVING NOVELISTS ONE OF THE LIMITED NUMBER WHOSE WORK REALLY COUNTED
HE SAW TWO AEROPLANES STRAIGHT ABOVE HIM
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES I SAID
YOU PROMISE
AND A HOLDER OF NO FEWER THAN THREE MUSKETRY CERTIFICATES LORD SMITH SMILED MODESTLY
THAT'S THE LESSER BUNTING I SAID HOPEFULLY
HERE WE ALL ARE
WHEN I GOT DOWN TO BREAKFAST I TOLD CELIA THE RESULT
AND THEN WE HAD ANOTHER SURPRISE
HAVE YOU FOUND IT I HAVE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HER MANNER OF HOLDING HERSELF AND THE IMPERIOUS TILT OF HER HEAD WHICH MADE HER SEEM ALMOST FIVE-AND-A-HALF
WHAT WAS THAT ONE ABOUT A DOOR SAID THE SQUIRE
THE WAY THE CHIMNEYS STAND UP I KNOW CRIED CELIA
NO TWO
THEY WOULD TALK TOGETHER IN THE INTERVALS OF ACORN-HUNTING FREDERICK'S SHARE OF THE CONVERSATION LIMITED TO HUMPHS UNINTELLIGIBLE AT FIRST BUT AS THE DAYS WENT ON SEEMING MORE AND MORE CHARGED WITH AN INNER MEANING TO HI-YOU UNTIL AT LAST HE COULD INTERPRET EVERY VARIATION OF GRUNT WITH WHICH HIS SMALL BLACK FRIEND RESPONDED
THESE FACTS BEING COMMUNICATED TO BINGO HIS NOSE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO GO BACK A LITTLE AND HIS TUB TO DEVELOP SOMETHING OF A WAIST
HE WAS A BIG STRONG MAN AND A POWERFUL SWIMMER BUT ONCE IN THE WATER IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CLING ROUND HIS NECK AND GIVE AN IMPRESSION THAT I WAS RESCUING HIM
FOR MONTHS I HAD BEEN SUFFERING JOHNNY IN SILENCE
YES THAT'S VERY GOOD SAID CAPTAIN BOLSOVER
ON THE MANY OCCASIONS WHEN HE AUTHORIZES A STARTLING STORY OF SOME WELL-KNOWN STATESMAN WITH THE WORDS
WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK IT'S TOO HOT FOR ANYTHING AND I MUST SIT DOWN
BUT AT LEAST IT IS ORIENTAL
OF COURSE SHE MIGHT BE SOMETHING SPECIAL
AS IT SLOWED DOWN THE TENSION IN THE CROWD WOULD INCREASE
IT MAKES A DIFFERENT THING OF IT ALTOGETHER
ROSAMUND CRIED THE COLONEL
SO I SAID TO THE FISHMONGER I WANT SOME--SOME NICE LOBSTERS HOW MANY WOULD YOU LIKE ONE I SAID
CREME BRULEE
YET SOMETHING ELSE
IN THIS HE WAS SUCCESSFUL
I FOUND A CHINESE TOWN CALLED NING-PO WHICH STRIKES ME AS VERY MUCH LIKE BING-GO AND CELIA FOUND ANOTHER ONE CALLED YUNG-PING WHICH MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE YUNG-BING THE OBVIOUS NAME OF BINGO'S HEIR WHEN HE HAS ONE
THIS IS ABSURD I SAID AFTER THREE OR FOUR MINUTES
THAT IS ALL I SAID FAINTLY
BUT NOW I WILL PURSUE HIM AND GET BACK THE PAPERS AND HE LEFT THE BOAT AT THE NEXT PORT AND BOARDED ONE FOR AMERICA
9S
ANDREW HAD BEEN DINING WITH ME THAT NIGHT
WELL I HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER GO AT IT
AT THE APPOINTED HOUR GASPARD PUT HIS HEAD CAUTIOUSLY OUT OF HIS BEDROOM WINDOW AND GAZED UP INTO THE HEAVENS
HIGH JINKS AT HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL AN INEVITABLE ARTICLE IN ANY DECENT MAGAZINE AT CHRISTMAS-TIME
THE HANDICAP OF SEX I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SAME DRAWING-ROOM WITH ANNE THE OTHER DAY SO I OFFERED HER ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SANDWICHES
WHEN IS A DOOR NOT A DOOR MISS PHIPPS SAID WHEN IT WAS A CUCUMBER
WE MOVED DOWN SLOWLY AND HE SAMPLED BILLET AFTER BILLET BUT WE ARRIVED AT LAST AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT FOR THE DAY
HE KEEPS A VISITORS BOOK AH WELL SAID THE GENERAL GETTING UP ANOTHER DAY PERHAPS WHEN WE WERE ALONE AGAIN BLAKE TURNED ON BILLY
ALL OF A TWITTER SHE SAID
A FINE REWARD
IT ISN'T MY FAULT I PROTESTED
YES SIGHED THE MAJOR I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE MIXING UP SHOOTING AND HUNTING MY LAD
MAKE IT SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE ARE SHARKS
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER AND THE KAISER'S OUT OF PRINT I'M GOING TO BUY SOME TORTOISES AND WATCH THE BEGGARS SPRINT
CELIA THOUGHT THAT THESE WERE A KIND OF NATIVE TROUSER LACED AT THE KNEE
THE WONDERFUL CONTRAST BETWEEN THE GREAT PAGEANT OF NATURE AND POOR MR JONES CATCHING--ALWAYS CATCHING--THE 8.15 BUT LORD POLDOODLE IS RISING AGAIN
NO RESTAURANT IN LONDON CAN MAKE US FEEL THAT THRILL AGAIN
MY DEAR SAID THE KING TO HIS DAUGHTER ONE DAY HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF MARRIAGE OFTEN FATHER SAID AMARIL
SO THAT IS HOW THE STORY IS NOW GOING ABOUT
WE HAD ANOTHER COUNT TOGETHER UP TO FIFTEEN
THERE GOOD MAN SAID DICK
I THINK THAT BY THIS TIME I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR JUST HOW MANY STARS I POSSESS
WE ALL GOT RATHER MIXED UP I SUPPOSE
IT WILL APPEAR IN THE GAZETTE IN DUE COURSE
ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF HIS BEST PLANTS WILL BE DISTURBED WHILE THERE IS MORE THAN A CHANCE THAT HE MAY LOSE THE SERVICES OF A LIBRARY WINDOW
AT A RANGE OF TEN YARDS HE OPENED FIRE
I'VE BROUGHT HIM BACK MISSIS HE SAID
BUT IS NOT THIS THE CASE WITH EVERY ONE OF US
THE YOUNGER CHADD WAS TWENTYISH WHEN WAR BROKE OUT BUT DID NOT WISH TO GET AN A.S.C
THE LAST POT LET OTHERS HYMN THE WEARINESS AND PAIN OR IF THEY WILL THE GLORY AND THE GLAMOUR OF HOLDING FAST FROM FLANDERS TO LORRAINE THE THIN BROWN LINE AT WHICH THE GERMANS HAMMER
KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY UNTIL HE HAS FINISHED WITH HIMSELF AND THEN FLY BACK HERE
DEAR O STOPES SHE SAID WITH HER MOUTH FULL
AT THE THIRD HOLE I HAD AN EIGHTEEN-INCH PUTT FOR A HALF
A MUSICAL PRODIGY SEVEN YEARS OLD WHO WILL ORDER THE FIFTH OBOE OUT OF THE ALBERT HALL AS SOON AS LOOK AT HIM
IT'S A BIT COLD YOU KNOW WELL MAKE QUITE SURE TO-MORROW
UNTIL I CAN DO THAT THE CHELSEA FLOWER SHOW IS NO PLACE FOR US
NO I ONLY JUST LOOKED IN--GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND SHE SEES ME ORDERING A MAN ABOUT IMPORTANTLY OR WAVING MY HAND TO HER AS I RIDE THROUGH THE OLD BARN ON MY ROAD TO THE GOLF COURSE
YOU WERE TWENTY-TWO AND THAT'S WHAT I HAD ENGRAVED ON IT
DON'T BE AN ASS SAID ROGERS
HE IS INNOCENT ROSAMUND SAID GEORGE FOR SO WE MUST CALL HIM NOW I AM INNOCENT
MR A
YOU WERE JUST A NICE SIZE BEFORE THE WAR ALL RIGHT
I HOPE I HAVEN'T OVER-DONE IT HE CAME WITH ME TO THE CLEARING STATION
I DO THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT SOMETHING I WENT AND SAT ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND HELD THE RING UP
IT WAS A WEEK AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF WILLIAM TREWULLIAM THE NOVEL WHICH HAD TAKEN ALL LONDON BY STORM
WHAT CAN I DO WHERE IS SHE ASKED RICHARD
INDEED BOTH THE DOCTOR AND THE NURSE SAY THAT I HAD BETTER LEAVE IT AT THAT
JOHNNY IN FACT IS DISCOVERING GOD SAVE THE KING WITH ONE FINGER
I HOPE YOU DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS I SAID
CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU GOOD HEAVENS
I MAY BE MORE
AND YET THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A TIME WHEN SHE AND I WERE VERY NEAR TOGETHER WHEN SOME ONE TOLD HER THAT IS MR BROWN OR INTRODUCED US THIS IS MR BROWN OR ASKED HER IF SHE'D HEARD OF MR BROWN
MR BLANK DIDN'T GET INTO IT AT ALL
THERE WAS A PERSON OF THAT NAME LIVING AT MY ADDRESS
I DECIDED TO ABANDON THE ICE
FOR I THOUGHT I WENT ON PATHETICALLY I QUITE THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE A CROWN OH I DO CRIED CELIA QUICKLY IF IT REALLY MEANS THAT SHE TOOK THE RING IN HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT IT LOVINGLY
WHY SHOULDN'T HE HAVE A HORSE
WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED YOU'VE HEARD OF WILLY FERRERO THE BOY CONDUCTOR
SO MARIA STRULTZ JILTED THE CAPTAIN
BUT LISTEN SHE READ OUT THE HEADLINE
A MATERIALLY-MINDED MAN WHISPERS TO HIS NEIGHBOUR THAT HE ALWAYS WONDERS WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST
LADY LARKSPUR FOLDING HER HANDS OVER HER CHEST AND GAZING BROODINGLY AT THE FOOTLIGHTS
IT WAS ADMIRABLE IN STEPHENSON TO HAVE SAID AS I AM SURE HE DID WHEN THEY CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS FIRST STEAM-ENGINE TUT-TUT IT'S NOTHING
I'LL SEND IT TO YOU RIGHT SAID HERBERT
COULD I TROUBLE YOU TO SAY THAT AGAIN HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE FREDERICK OF MILVANIA YES THAT WAS WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE LAST TIME FREDERICK MURMURED HI-YOU IN HIS FRIEND'S EAR THIS IS HIS MAJESTY KING CARRAWAY
THE ANSWER OUGHT TO BE EIGHT MILES AN HOUR LUCKILY HOWEVER SHE FORGOT TO ENCLOSE THE PROBLEM
R FOR--QUICK CELIA ROSE SHE SAID HASTILY
IT BELONGED TO A BULL-DOG
I AM GLAD NOW THAT WE LIVE SO HIGH
LORD AND WHILE MY MOUTH WAS OPEN TO PROTEST HOW DO YOU DO TO SOME ONE AT THE BACK
LOOK AT MR BOURCHIER EATING WE SAY EXCITEDLY TO EACH OTHER IN THE PIT HAVING HAD A VAGUE IDEA UP TILL THEN THAT AN ACTOR LIVED LIKE A GOD ON PRAISE AND GREASEPAINT AND HIS PHOTOGRAPH IN THE PAPERS
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HE SAYS WE ARE MET HERE THIS AFTERNOON IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO SOME OF OUR YOUNGER POETS WHO WILL RECITE FROM THEIR OWN WORKS
AND HAVING TOLD EVERYBODY SEVERAL TIMES THAT I HAD HEARD IT I TRIED TO MAKE THE CONVERSATION MORE INTERESTING
AFTER ALL MY DEAR ALGERNON HE SAID WE ARE COUSINS
OF COURSE IN MY REVIEW I SAID ALL THE USUAL THINGS
HANDSOME JACK ELLISON WAS AS USUAL IN DEEP CONVERSATION WITH THE BEAUTIFUL MISS HOLDEN WHO IT WAS AGREED AMONG THE LADIES OF THE PARTY WAS NOT ALTOGETHER INDIFFERENT TO HIS FINE FIGURE AND REMARKABLE PROSPECTS
NINEPENCE CRIED THE SQUIRE WITH A HEARTY LAUGH
AND THE REGIMENT IN THE COMPARATIVE SAFETY OF THEIR TRENCH COULD ONLY LOOK ON HELPLESSLY
IT WAS TO BLOW AWAY SHELLS AND BULLETS WHEN THEY CAME TOO NEAR THE MASTER IN WHOSE POCKET HE SAT
ON CERTAIN MORNINGS IN THE WEEK--NO NEED TO SPECIFY THEM--I ENTER MY LIBRARY AND GIVE MYSELF UP TO LITERARY COMPOSITION
DAHLIA AND I COME NEXT
GASPARD HIMSELF FELT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER GREATLY
DO THINK SAMUEL I INTERRUPTED HOW MUCH MORE SPLENDID IF YOU COULD BE THE ONLY MAN WHO HAD SEEN MONTE CARLO WITHOUT GOING INSIDE THE ROOMS
THE DAY OF RECKONING HAD COME
BUT FOR REASONS CONNECTED WITH TOBY I HOPE HE WON'T COME AGAIN
TEA IS THE MOST USUAL MEAL ON THE STAGE FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE THE PROPERTY LUMP OF SUGAR BEING DUSTED AND USED AGAIN ON THE NEXT NIGHT
WELL THEN HELP ME TO BUY SOMETHING FOR IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK CRIED CELIA BURSTING INTO MY ROOM
NO WE SHALL HAVE TO STEP WESTWARD
THERE IS HARDLY A PRINCE LEFT WHO IS IN ANY WAY ELIGIBLE EXCEPT PRINCE FREDERICK SAID AMARIL GENTLY
THE GREAT THING IS NOT TO SPEAK THEM
IT MAY BE THAT I AM SUPERSTITIOUS
HOW MANY I ASKED SOME MINUTES LATER
OH THANKS VERY MUCH WHAT WILL YOU HAVE SIR ASKED BLAKE LOOKING ROUND WILDLY
YOUR MEREDITH
