IT HAS HAD ALL THE CHARM WHICH THE FRENCH-WOMAN ATTRIBUTED TO FORBIDDEN PLEASURES ONE OF THE EARLIEST THINGS I CAN REMEMBER SAID MARGARET WAS YOUR BEING IN SOME GREAT DISGRACE FRED FOR STEALING APPLES
MEASTER DO YO THINK WE CAN E'ER GET ON TOGETHER WELL SAID MR THORNTON HALF-LAUGHING IT WAS NOT MY PROPOSAL THAT WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER
BUT HE PUT MY ARM IN HIS AND KEPT STROKING MY HAND AS IF HE WANTED TO SOOTHE ME TO BE VERY QUIET UNDER SOME GREAT HEAVY BLOW
AND THEN WHEN WE WERE IN THE FIELD THE LOW RED SUNLIGHT JUST IN MY FACE SOME ONE CAME BY ON HORSEBACK IN THE ROAD JUST BELOW THE FIELD-STYLE BY WHICH WE STOOD
HE TURNED ROUND
I'VE DONE IT MISS
MARGARET MY CHILD YOU MIGHT HAVE GATHERED US SOME PEARS FOR OUR DESSERT SAID MR HALE AS THE HOSPITABLE LUXURY OF A FRESHLY-DECANTED BOTTLE OF WINE WAS PLACED ON THE TABLE
OUR NEW VICAR HAS SEVEN CHILDREN AND IS BUILDING A NURSERY READY FOR MORE JUST OUT WHERE THE ARBOUR AND TOOL-HOUSE USED TO BE IN OLD TIMES
HOW LONG SHE LAY THUS SHE COULD NOT TELL
THEY SAY SO REPLIED BESSY
SO BAD
MR THORNTON HURRIED TO HIS WAREHOUSE AND STERNLY FORBIDDING HIS CLERKS TO ALLOW ANY ONE TO INTERRUPT HIM HE WENT HIS WAY TO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR
SUCH A SICKENING ALARM
SHE'S GOT GRAND RELATIONS AND THEY'RE CARRYING HER OFF
BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE-OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME
WON'T YOU LET US COME IN NO SAID HE
TELL ME ALL
LIE ON THIS SOFA--THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO DO THAT IS THE WORST SAID MARGARET IN A SAD WHISPER
SHE SAT FACING HIM AND FACING THE LIGHT
AND IN THE COUNTRY SOME GET SUCH STAGNANT HABITS OF MIND THAT THEY ARE ALMOST FATALISTS YES
AND SHE HAD USED THE WORD CHIVALRIC--AND HER FATHER HAD CORRECTED HER WITH THE HIGHER WORD CHRISTIAN
SO WHAT WILL YOU DO MARGARET OH I CAN MANAGE
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF INDIGNATION EXPRESSED IN HER COUNTENANCE BUT SO KEPT DOWN AND CONTROLLED THAT IT GAVE HER A SUPERB AIR OF DISDAIN
BUT WOULD YOU REALLY GO IN SUCH WEATHER AS THIS OH
I THINK IT A CERTAIN PROOF HE HAD A BAD HEART
AND SHE HEARD HIM UPON THE LANDING OPENING AND SHUTTING THE BED-ROOM DOORS WITHOUT ANY APPARENT OBJECT
SHE ROUSED UP
HE HAD POSITIVE BODILY PAIN,--A VIOLENT HEADACHE AND A THROBBING INTERMITTENT PULSE
BUT I WANT SOME THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD THAT'S FAR AWAY TO TAKE THE WEARY TASTE OF IT OUT O MY MOUTH
IT WOULD TAX MY PRIDE ABOVE A BIT
AND SHE SHRANK AND SHUDDERED AS UNDER THE FASCINATION OF SOME GREAT POWER REPUGNANT TO HER WHOLE PREVIOUS LIFE
WHO IS WITH YOU
MRS SLICKSON WAS CATECHISING FANNY ON THE SAME SUBJECT
BUT IN DEFAULT OF A LISTENER SHE HAD TO BROOD OVER THE CHANGE IN HER LIFE SILENTLY AS HERETOFORE
IT WAS A MOST AFFECTIONATE LETTER AND EXPRESSED GREAT AND TRUE REGRET FOR HIS INABILITY TO ATTEND
AND HALF SMILED BACK AT THEIR REMARKS
THE TWO FAMILIES WERE LIVING IN ONE HOUSE
GONE HOME YES
THE LINES IN HER FATHER'S FACE WERE SOFT AND WAVING WITH A FREQUENT UNDULATING KIND OF TREMBLING MOVEMENT PASSING OVER THEM SHOWING EVERY FLUCTUATING EMOTION
MARGARET WAS SILENT
SOLELY TO ORNAMENT AND THEN TO PRESERVE ORNAMENT FROM DIRT OR DESTRUCTION
HE IS A MAN OF GREAT STRENGTH OF CHARACTER,--OF UNUSUAL INTELLECT CONSIDERING THE FEW ADVANTAGES HE HAS HAD NOT SO FEW
HE WAS FALLING AND SHE WAS STRUGGLING TO SAVE HIM BUT HELD BACK BY SOME INVISIBLE POWERFUL HAND
IN OXFORD I COULD HAVE MANAGED ALL THE LANDLORDS IN THE PLACE AND HAD MY OWN WAY WITH HALF THE TROUBLE YOUR MILTON LANDLORD HAS GIVEN ME AND DEFEATED ME AFTER ALL
HE CAME OUT LOOKED UP AT THEM--THE PALE CLUSTER OF FACES--AND SMILED GOOD COURAGE TO THEM BEFORE HE LOCKED THE FACTORY-DOOR
QUIETLY AND PATIENTLY WAITED FOR HIS TIME TO MOVE
SOMETIMES THERE WAS AN EXPRESS ANSWER TO WHAT SHE HAD REMARKED BUT GIVEN TO ANOTHER PERSON AS THOUGH UNSUGGESTED BY HER
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US ALL
OH MARGARET SAID HE HOLDING HER OFF BY HER SHOULDERS AFTER THEY HAD KISSED EACH OTHER AS IF EVEN IN THAT DARKNESS HE COULD SEE HER FACE AND READ IN ITS EXPRESSION A QUICKER ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION THAN WORDS COULD GIVE MY MOTHER
UNTIL NOW HE HAD NEVER RECOGNISED HOW MUCH AND HOW DEEP WAS THE INTEREST HE HAD GROWN OF LATE TO FEEL IN HIS POSITION AS MANUFACTURER SIMPLY BECAUSE IT LED HIM INTO SUCH CLOSE CONTACT AND GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SO MUCH POWER AMONG A RACE OF PEOPLE STRANGE SHREWD IGNORANT
THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY WITHOUT ME I DARE SAY BUT THIS WAS OVER-LEAPING THE RATIONAL CONCLUSION,--AS IN AN INSTANT HER WELL-POISED JUDGMENT FELT
BUT SOME HOW YOURS REST ME
HE WERE ALL IN SUCH A TREMBLE WI SPENT PASSION I COULD NA BEAR TO LOOK AT HIM
STILL AT YOUR REQUEST,--IF IT WILL BE ANY COMFORT TO YOU I WILL PROMISE YOU THEN CAME A PAUSE
CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS HOWEVER QUITE IN THE DARK
SHE MET DIXON ON THE LANDING
AND ALMOST IN PROPORTION TO HER RE-ESTABLISHMENT IN HEALTH WAS HER FATHER'S RELAPSE INTO HIS ABSTRACTED MUSING UPON THE WIFE HE HAD LOST AND THE PAST ERA IN HIS LIFE THAT WAS CLOSED TO HIM FOR EVER
IT SEEMED TO TOUCH ON AND CALL OUT ALL THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE WHICH HAD OFTEN REPELLED HER IN HIM
THERE ARE SORROWS TO BEAR EVERYWHERE
POOR MARIA HE MET WITH AN ECHO EVEN LOUDER THAN HIS SIGH
IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN THUS COMPELLED TO WRITE STEADILY AND CONCISELY ON SHE MIGHT HAVE HESITATED OVER MANY A WORD AND BEEN PUZZLED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MANY AN EXPRESSION IN THE AWKWARDNESS OF BEING THE FIRST TO RESUME THE INTERCOURSE OF WHICH THE CONCLUDING EVENT HAD BEEN SO UNPLEASANT TO BOTH SIDES
NOW WHEN I FEEL THAT IN MY OWN CASE IT IS NO GOOD LUCK NOR MERIT NOR TALENT,--BUT SIMPLY THE HABITS OF LIFE WHICH TAUGHT ME TO DESPISE INDULGENCES NOT THOROUGHLY EARNED,--INDEED NEVER TO THINK TWICE ABOUT THEM,--I BELIEVE THAT THIS SUFFERING WHICH MISS HALE SAYS IS IMPRESSED ON THE COUNTENANCES OF THE PEOPLE OF MILTON IS BUT THE NATURAL PUNISHMENT OF DISHONESTLY-ENJOYED PLEASURE AT SOME FORMER PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES
UNLESS INDEED THAT VEILED CURIOSITY OF HIS AS TO WHAT MANNER OF MAN HE HAD TO TALK TO WAS NOT A GOOD PIECE AND A FAIR INDICATION OF HIS CHARACTER
MARGARET'S ATTENTION WAS THUS CALLED TO HER HOST
MR THORNTON HAS NEVER RESPECTED ME SINCE HE RESPECTS YOU I AM SURE SAID MR BELL
PAPA IS'--SHE STARTED A LITTLE A HARDLY VISIBLE START--BUT FREDERICK FELT THE SUDDEN MOTION OF THE HAND HE HELD AND TURNED HIS FULL FACE TO THE ROAD ALONG WHICH A HORSEMAN WAS SLOWLY RIDING JUST PASSING THE VERY STILE WHERE THEY STOOD
AND SO I AM
HERE SHE TURNED ROUND AND SAID TAKE CARE PAPA DOES NOT COME DOWN
DON'T LOSE TIME DEAR DEAR MARGARET
AS HER FINGERS WERE ON THE HANDLE HE CALLED HER BACK
ABOUT MARGARET
THE DISTANT CLANK OF THE SOLDIERS WAS HEARD JUST FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE TO MAKE THIS VANISHED MOB FEEL THE POWER OF AUTHORITY AND ORDER
THEN CAME THE THOUGHT OF MR THORNTON'S COGNISANCE OF HER FALSEHOOD
IT WILL BE A TRIAL I KNOW TO BOTH OF US BUT IT WILL BE A PLEASURE TO ME AT LEAST
HERE HAS BEEN A MESSAGE FROM BESSY HIGGINS ASKING YOU TO GO TO HER SAID MRS HALE
LET THEM INSULT MY MAIDEN PRIDE AS THEY WILL--I WALK PURE BEFORE GOD SHE LOOKED UP AND A NOBLE PEACE SEEMED TO DESCEND AND CALM HER FACE TILL IT WAS STILLER THAN CHISELLED MARBLE DIXON CAME IN
WILL IT BE TOO LATE TO DISTURB THEM JOHN COME BACK TO ME FOR THIS ONE EVENING
BUT NOW THE CASE WAS CHANGED
EVERYTHING SEEMED DIM AND VAGUE BEYOND--BEHIND--BESIDES THE TOUCH OF HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK--THE SOFT CLINGING WHICH MADE THE DARK COLOUR COME AND GO IN HIS CHEEK AS HE THOUGHT OF IT
IT'S NO USE
DIXON FACED ROUND AND SPOKE TO HER
AND ALL THIS TIME SHE NEVER CLOSED HER EYES OR CEASED FROM THAT GLASSY DREAM-LIKE STARE
YET MARGARET AND HER AUNT MUST HAVE THE DRAWING-ROOM TO THEMSELVES IS MRS.--IS HER AUNT COME ASKED MR THORNTON
SHE HAD NOT BEEN QUITE SURE FROM HER AUNT'S RATHER CONFUSED ACCOUNT OF HIS ENGAGEMENTS WHETHER HE WOULD COME THAT NIGHT
BETSY SAYS THAT THE NIGHT ON WHICH HER LOVER--I FORGET HIS NAME--FOR SHE ALWAYS CALLS HIM HE LEONARDS THE NIGHT ON WHICH LEONARDS WAS LAST SEEN AT THE STATION--WHEN HE WAS LAST SEEN ON DUTY IN FACT--MISS HALE WAS THERE WALKING ABOUT WITH A YOUNG MAN WHO BETSY BELIEVES KILLED LEONARDS BY SOME BLOW OR PUSH LEONARDS WAS NOT KILLED BY ANY BLOW OR PUSH HOW DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE I DISTINCTLY PUT THE QUESTION TO THE SURGEON OF THE INFIRMARY
AND AS HE HAD TALKED PRETTY MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND SO PASSING THE TIME WHILE THEIR ROAD LAY TOGETHER HE WAS VERY INDIFFERENT AS TO THE EXACT SIDE HE TOOK UPON THE QUESTION AND QUIETLY CAME ROUND BY SAYING
NOW THAT I HAVE MY MOTHER SAFE IN THE QUIET PEACE THAT BECOMES HER AGE AND DULY REWARDS HER FORMER EXERTIONS I CAN TURN TO ALL THAT OLD NARRATION AND THOROUGHLY ENJOY IT I DARE SAY MY REMARK CAME FROM THE PROFESSIONAL FEELING OF THERE BEING NOTHING LIKE LEATHER REPLIED MR HALE
SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT ALL WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM IF ONLY SHE COULD BE SURE THAT HE WOULD KNOW
AY THAT DID HE
YOU'LL NOT BE OFFENDED BUT I THINK YOU MAKE SOME SAD MISTAKES
NO SAID HE I PUT IT TO THE TOUCH ONCE AND I LOST IT ALL
YOU WILL COME BACK HERE BEFORE YOU GO TO THE HALES SAID SHE IN A LOW ANXIOUS VOICE
EVERYTHING IS SO MUCH DEARER IN A TOWN
WE WERE THINKING SAID MR HALE THAT YOU AND MR THORNTON HAD TAKEN MARGARET'S ADVICE AND WERE EACH TRYING TO CONVERT THE OTHER YOU WERE SO LONG IN THE STUDY AND YOU THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT OF US BUT AN OPINION LIKE THE KILKENNY CAT'S TAIL
I ALSO PROMISE THAT IF EVER I SEE HER DOING WHAT I THINK IS WRONG BUT MARGARET NEVER DOES WRONG--NOT WILFULLY WRONG PLEADED MRS HALE
AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION
BUT I WON'T TRY AND DESCRIBE IT ANY MORE
AT LEAST I KNOW THAT MANY DISSENTERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE PEACE SOCIETY AND I AM AFRAID HE WOULD NOT LIKE TO COME
NOW I AM GLAD IT WAS A LITTLE GOLDEN THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THE DARK WEB OF HIS PRESENT FORTUNES
YOU SHALL
THE PHILOSOPHER AND IDIOT PUBLICAN AND PHARISEE ALL EAT AFTER THE SAME FASHION--GIVEN AN EQUALLY GOOD DIGESTION
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU SHE SLOWLY FACED HIM GLOWING WITH BEAUTIFUL SHAME
HERE I STAY OUT MY LIFE
A GOWN I HAD FOR A COUSIN'S WEDDING A YEAR AGO
NOW DON'T YOU THINK WE COULD GET MAMMA THERE WITH DIXON WHILE YOU AND I GO AND LOOK AT HOUSES AND GET ONE ALL READY FOR HER IN MILTON
AND THE QUIVERING SANK INTO STILLNESS
HER MOTHER--HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER--SEEMED NOW AND THEN SO MUCH DISCONTENTED WITH THEIR SITUATION
BUT THAT IS HIS FAULT NOT MINE
I WILL HOPE
A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IT WAS CALLED
WALK AT YOUR OWN PACE AND I WILL FOLLOW
BUT I'LL SAY THIS FOR HAMPER AND THANK HIM FOR IT AT MY DYING DAY HE DROVE BOUCHER AWAY AND WOULD NA LISTEN TO HIM--NE'ER A WORD--THOUGH FOLK STANDING BY SAYS THE TRAITOR CRIED LIKE A BABBY OH
BUT DON'T YOU GIVE ME CREDIT FOR HAVING SOME THOUGH NOT THE SAME AS YOURS HE WAS SPEAKING IN A SUBDUED VOICE AS IF TO HER ALONE
SHE SIGHED AS SHE ROSE UP TO GO TO BED
I COULD WISH THERE WERE A GOD IF IT WERE ONLY TO ASK HIM TO BLESS THEE MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
MANY STEPS WERE HEARD NOT MOVING ONWARDS AT LEAST NOT WITH ANY RAPIDITY OR STEADINESS OF MOTION BUT AS IF CIRCLING ROUND ONE SPOT
AND THEN REJECTING HER OFFERED HAND AND MAKING AS IF HE DID NOT SEE HER GRAVE LOOK OF REGRET HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AWAY AND LEFT THE ROOM
OUGHT I TO BE FLATTERED I DON'T KNOW OXFORD
STRAIGHT TO MILTON OR WHERE
WRITE BY RETURN IF ONLY TWO LINES TO TELL ME YOUR ANSWER
THERE WAS NO USE IN SPEAKING ABOUT IT
NOW IF YOU PLEASE SAID SHE I MUST GO
COULD HE HAVE BECOME IMPLICATED IN ANYTHING FREDERICK HAD DONE
WHAT IS THAT HEAP OF BRICK AND MORTAR WE CAME AGAINST IN THE YARD
I'D PROMISE THAT WHEN I SEED YO GOING WRONG AND ACTING UNFAIR I'D SPEAK TO YO IN PRIVATE FIRST
AND IN TRUTH SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO CONTROL THEM BUT RATHER CALLED UP ALL THE PICTURES OF THE HAPPY PAST AND THE PROBABLE FUTURE--PAINTING THE SCENE WHEN SHE SHOULD LIE A CORPSE WITH THE SON SHE HAD LONGED TO SEE IN LIFE WEEPING OVER HER AND SHE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE--TILL SHE WAS MELTED BY SELF-PITY INTO A STATE OF SOBBING AND EXHAUSTION THAT MADE MARGARET'S HEART ACHE
YOU HAVE NEVER MENTIONED THEM NO
AND THEN WHAT WITH SHOLTO PLAYING WITH THE FIRE AND THE BABY CRYING YOU'LL BEGIN TO WISH FOR A STRONG-MINDED WOMAN EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY AND YOU'LL NOT GROW TOO GOOD TO JOKE AND BE MERRY NOT I
THERE WAS GLOOM OVER THE TOWN
YET HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE RISE WHICH IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY ENABLE HIM THE POOR BARRISTER TO TAKE
WITH FREDERICK
DIXON SHE SAID IN THE LOW TONE SHE ALWAYS USED WHEN MUCH EXCITED WHICH HAD A SOUND IN IT AS OF SOME DISTANT TURMOIL OR THREATENING STORM BREAKING FAR AWAY
I MUST GO TO MILTON BY THE NEXT TRAIN THE BAG WAS PACKED THE CAB ORDERED THE RAILWAY REACHED IN TWENTY MINUTES FROM THE MOMENT OF THIS DECISION
HOW PROUD THAT MAN IS SAID HER FATHER WHO WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED AT THE MANNER IN WHICH HIGGINS HAD DECLINED HIS INTERCESSION WITH MR THORNTON
SHE WOULD GET A BREATH OF SEA AIR TO SET HER UP FOR THE WINTER AND BE SPARED ALL THE FATIGUE AND DIXON WOULD ENJOY TAKING CARE OF HER IS DIXON TO GO WITH US ASKED MR HALE IN A KIND OF HELPLESS DISMAY
YOU HAVE MANY CHILDREN I PRESUME SEVEN
YOU WOULD THINK IT ROMANTIC TO BE WALKING WITH A PERSON FAT AND SCANT O BREATH IF I WERE HAMLET PRINCE OF DENMARK
OF HER MOTHER'S IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MRS PURKIS WAS AWARE FROM HER OMISSION OF HER NAME
WHERE'S THE NOTE FOR HER
YOU ARE MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE AM I SAID MARGARET TURNING ROUND AND SHOWING HER EYES ALL AGLOW WITH STRANGE FIRE HER CHEEKS FLUSHED THOUGH HER LIPS WERE BAKED AND LIVID STILL
AND MR THORNTON
BUT SHE NEVER MOVED A FEATURE--NEVER TOOK HER DEEP SERIOUS EYES OFF HIM
SO YO SEE IT WAS YO NAY BESSY SAID MARGARET GENTLY IT WAS BUT A DREAM AND WHY MIGHT NA I DREAM A DREAM IN MY AFFLICTION AS WELL AS OTHERS
NO WONDER IT IS MOPED POOR DARLING MARGARET DID NOT FEEL AS IF THE DINNER-PARTIES WOULD BE A PANACEA
IT DISTRESSED MRS HALE EXCESSIVELY
I WILL IN SPITE OF A THOUSAND DOCTORS
QUITE IN A TREMBLE OF EAGERNESS
SHALL YOU BE AFRAID TO BE LEFT WITHOUT ME UNTIL I CAN GET SOME OF THE POLICE
I WILL GO
I WILL GO
LEASTWAYS I RECKON I DID
IT WOULD SEEM UNFAIR--UNKIND TO YOUR MOTHER WHO ALWAYS I'M AFRAID DISLIKED MILTON SO MUCH IF WE LEFT IT NOW SHE IS LYING HERE AND CANNOT GO WITH US
MR THORNTON IS WITH HIM NOW THE INSPECTOR WAS ALMOST DAUNTED BY THE HAUGHTINESS OF HER MANNER AS SHE ENTERED
I MET HIM THIS MORNING JUST AS HE WAS COMING OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND AS HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE BESIDES BEING THE MAGISTRATE WHO SAW LEONARDS LAST NIGHT I MADE BOLD TO TELL HIM OF MY DIFFICULTY MARGARET SIGHED DEEPLY
RELEVONS-NOUS ET QUITTONS-LA POUR JAMAIS RECLAMONS LA MISERICORDE DE DIEU ET ESPERONS EN ELLE QU'ELLE NOUS ASSISTERA POUR DESORMAIS ESTRE PLUS FERMES
A CANDLE IN HER OLD BEDROOM WHICH WAS THE NURSERY WITH THE PRESENT INHABITANTS OF THE PARSONAGE UNTIL THE NEW ONE WAS BUILT
BECAUSE THEY LABOUR TEN HOURS A-DAY FOR US I DO NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE ANY RIGHT TO IMPOSE LEADING-STRINGS UPON THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR TIME
THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO ASK HIGGINS'S OBSTINACY WAVERED RECOVERED STRENGTH AND STOOD FIRM
I'M THANKFUL THEY HAVEN'T A BED
MEASTER I'VE NOT FORGETTEN MR THORNTON WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT
SHE HAD TWENTY QUESTIONS ON THE TIP OF HER TONGUE TO ASK MR BELL BUT NOT ONE OF THEM DID SHE UTTER
THE MOMENT THAT RETREAT HAD CHANGED INTO A FLIGHT AS IT WAS SURE FROM ITS VERY CHARACTER TO DO HE DARTED UP THE STEPS TO MARGARET
BUT WITH THE INCREASE OF SERIOUS AND JUST GROUND OF COMPLAINT A NEW KIND OF PATIENCE HAD SPRUNG UP IN HER MOTHER'S MIND
THIS MARRING OF THE PEACE OF HOME BY LONG HOURS OF DISCONTENT WAS WHAT MARGARET WAS UNPREPARED FOR
YOU'LL MAKE ME FEEL WICKED AND GUILTY IN GOING TO THIS DINNER NO SAID BESSY
HOW REDEEM IT BY A SPECULATION OFFERED TO ME FULL OF RISK
HE THAT MADE THAT SPEECH IN HURSTFIELD NO I DIDN'T SAID MR THORNTON LOOKING ROUND SHARPLY AT HIS FOLLOWER
THAT IS ALL I CAN DO
NOW MARGARET HAVE YOU FLOWN OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THIS FAR AND WONDERED WHAT RIGHT THE OLD MAN HAS TO SETTLE YOUR AFFAIRS FOR YOU SO CAVALIERLY
AT LAST MRS THORNTON CAME IN RUSTLING IN HANDSOME BLACK SILK AS WAS HER WONT
MARGARET SAID MR HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS
HOW CAN I BEAR PAPA'S AGONY
BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED
AND MANY TIMES HAD THE DOOR OPENED AND SOME INDIFFERENT PERSON ENTERED ON SOME INSIGNIFICANT ERRAND
I NEVER WAS AWARE OF ANY YOUNG LADY TRYING TO CATCH ME YET NOR DO I BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAS EVER GIVEN THEMSELVES THAT USELESS TROUBLE MRS THORNTON DID NOT CHOOSE TO YIELD THE POINT TO HER SON
I'M NOT SAYING HE DID RIGHT AND I'M NOT SAYING HE DID WRONG
WHAT I DO EXCLUDE IS THE REMORSE AFTERWARDS
I WOULD NOT HARM A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD
SPEAKING OF LIFE IN LONDON AND LIFE IN THE COUNTRY AS IF HE WERE CONSCIOUS OF HIS SECOND MOCKING SELF AND AFRAID OF HIS OWN SATIRE
BUT AS SHE SAID TO HERSELF MISS MARGARET HAS A TOUCH OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN ABOUT HER AS WELL AS POOR MASTER FREDERICK
THERE WERE ONLY TWO LADIES BESIDES THEIR OWN PARTY AND AS THESE WERE OCCUPIED IN CONVERSATION BY HER AUNT AND EDITH WHEN THEY WENT UP INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM MARGARET LANGUIDLY EMPLOYED HERSELF ABOUT SOME WORK
IS HE A GREAT DEAL HERE I FANCY HE IS WHEN HE IS IN TOWN
THERE WAS A SLIGHT DEMAND FOR FINISHED GOODS
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE GOT TO SAY TO MISS HALE TO-MORROW THE QUESTION CAME UPON HER SUDDENLY DURING A PAUSE IN WHICH SHE AT LEAST HAD FORGOTTEN MARGARET
TO THE WORKMEN IN HIS MILL HE SPOKE NOT MANY WORDS BUT THEY KNEW HIM BY THIS TIME
MR BELL GAVE A GREAT SIGH
WHAT PART WERE YOU IN
LET US ASK HIM ABOUT THE STRIKE AND GIVE HIM ALL THE SYMPATHY HE NEEDS AND HOPED TO HAVE FROM POOR BESSY SO THEY QUESTIONED AND LISTENED
SHE DID HEAR OR PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY A DREAM OF HERS THOUGH IT WOULD BE STRANGE IF SHE HAD DREAMT OF SUCH PEOPLE AS THE HIGGINSES THAT MARY HAD GONE TO WORK AT MR THORNTON'S MILL BECAUSE HER FATHER WISHED HER TO KNOW HOW TO COOK
I DO IT IN DEFIANCE OF HER HE WENT AT AN UNUSUAL PACE AND WAS SOON AT CRAMPTON
THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION ASKED MARGARET MORE SHOCKED THAN EVER
ONLY MARY AND ONE OR TWO OF THE BOUCHER CHILDREN AT HOME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
I'M AFRAID NOT SAID MARGARET
COME HERE COME DIRECTLY IT'S MISS HALE AND THEN SHE WENT UP TO MARGARET AND SHOOK HER HANDS WITH MOTHERLY FONDNESS
MARGARET THOUGHT HIM COLDER IF MORE BRILLIANT THAN FORMERLY
SHE DISAPPROVES OF THE WHOLE PLAN AND NOW WE NEVER MENTION IT TO EACH OTHER
POOR CHILD SAID EDITH
CAN'T THE BISHOP SET HIM RIGHT ASKED MRS HALE HALF IMPATIENTLY
TO THE POST-OFFICE,--WITH A LETTER
HE'S BUT A WEAK KIND O CHAP I KNOW BUT HE'S A MAN FOR A THAT
HE LOOKS SADLY CHANGED--TERRIBLY SHAKEN
SHE MIGHT TALK TO HIM OF THE OLD SPOT AND NEVER FEAR TIRING HIM
HELEN HAD SET HER HEART UPON AN INDIAN SHAWL BUT REALLY WHEN I FOUND WHAT AN EXTRAVAGANT PRICE WAS ASKED I WAS OBLIGED TO REFUSE HER
WROTE IT WITH SWIFT URGENT ENTREATY
BUT I CAN FANCY THAT YOU WILL
NEITHER SHALL THE SUN LIGHT ON THEM NOR ANY HEAT MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS--OR MAY HAVE BEEN
HER JET BLACK HAIR HER CLEAR SMOOTH SKIN HER LUCID EYES WOULD NOT HELP TO SAVE HER ONE WORD OF THE JUST AND STERN REPROACH WHICH MRS THORNTON SPENT HALF THE NIGHT IN PREPARING TO HER MIND
WOULD IT BE TOO LATE TO STOP HIM IF YOU WROTE AGAIN MARGARET I'M AFRAID IT WOULD MAMMA SAID MARGARET REMEMBERING THE URGENCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTREATED HIM TO COME DIRECTLY IF HE WISHED TO SEE HIS MOTHER ALIVE
STILL SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PREFERRED A GOOD HOUSE IN BELGRAVIA TO ALL THE PICTURESQUENESS OF THE LIFE WHICH CAPTAIN LENNOX DESCRIBED AT CORFU
GOOD-BYE BESSY STILLED HER ROCKING TO GAZE AFTER HER
ONLY SUPPOSE THAT YOUR MOTHER'S HEALTH OR YOURS SHOULD SUFFER
HE IS SAID MARGARET
HOW ARE YOU MRS BOUCHER
SIXTEEN YEARS AGO MY FATHER DIED UNDER VERY MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
SHE COULD HARDLY THANK HIM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL KINDNESS WHICH BROUGHT HIM THAT VERY EVENING TO OFFER HER--FOR THE DELICACY WHICH MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST OFFER HER PRIVATELY--EVERY CONVENIENCE FOR ILLNESS THAT HIS OWN WEALTH OR HIS MOTHER'S FORESIGHT HAD CAUSED THEM TO ACCUMULATE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND WHICH AS HE LEARNT FROM DR DONALDSON MRS HALE MIGHT POSSIBLY REQUIRE
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE A GREAT NOTION OF GIVING HERSELF AIRS
IN THE FACTORY THERE YES
HE COULD HAVE STRUCK HER BEFORE HE LEFT IN ORDER THAT BY SOME STRANGE OVERT ACT OF RUDENESS HE MIGHT EARN THE PRIVILEGE OF TELLING HER THE REMORSE THAT GNAWED AT HIS HEART
WE MAY NOT BE HERE LONG DO YOU FEEL ILL MY DARLING ASKED MRS HALE ANXIOUSLY MISUNDERSTANDING MARGARET'S HINT OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR STAY AT HELSTONE
IT'LL BE SOON MARGARET WAS SHOCKED BY HIS WORDS--SHOCKED BUT NOT REPELLED
I RECKON I KNOW WHO'D HA BEEN SORRY FOR TO SEE OUR MEASTER SITTING SO LIKE A PIECE O GREY CALICO
HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE
THEN HE PUSHED HIS CHAIR AWAY FROM THE TABLE AND TRIED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
SURELY THEY WILL GIVE YOU A REASON FOR IT
I CAN'T HELP REGRETTING CONSTANTLY THAT PAPA HAS REALLY NO ONE TO ASSOCIATE WITH HERE
I HAVE SOME LETTERS AND PAPERS THAT I WANT TO SHOW TO MISS HALE AND MR BELL I HOPE MR BELL WILL MAKE OUR HOUSE HIS OWN DURING HIS STAY IN LONDON SAID CAPTAIN LENNOX
NOR DID SHE FEEL AT LIBERTY TO NAME WHAT EDITH HAD TOLD HER OF THE IDEA HE HAD ENTERTAINED,--IT MIGHT BE BUT FOR FIVE MINUTES,--OF GOING TO SPAIN
BIDDING THEM RUN ALL RISKS AND ESCAPE DOWN THERE IF THEY HEARD ANY ATTACK MADE ON THE MILL-DOORS
SORROWS IS MORE PLENTIFUL THAN DINNERS JUST NOW
I MUST GO SAID HE I CANNOT STAY
THEN SHE SAID
THEN SHE SAID
THEN SHE SAID
REMEMBERING TOO THE HORSES TO HER CARRIAGE HIRED FOR HER OWN VISIT TO THE HALES AND HOW FANNY HAD BEEN ORDERED TO GO BY MR THORNTON IN ORDER TO PAY EVERY RESPECT TO THEM MRS THORNTON DREW UP SLIGHTLY OFFENDED AND GAVE MARGARET NO SYMPATHY--INDEED HARDLY ANY CREDIT FOR THE STATEMENT OF HER MOTHER'S INDISPOSITION
BUT THE VERY OUT-SPOKENNESS MARKED THEIR INNOCENCE OF ANY INTENTION TO HURT HER DELICACY AS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IF SHE HAD BEEN LESS FRIGHTENED BY THE DISORDERLY TUMULT
HIS THOUGHTS SUDDENLY BENT UPON LEARNING WHAT SHE HAD SAID
LOST ALL SENSE OF IT
I MUST GIVE WAY SOMETIMES
DO YOU CALL HIM GOOD LOOKING MARGARET NO
WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES THE MAN WANT TO COME HERE FOR
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A MAN THAT HAD GOT INTO THE HOUSE NONSENSE
NO OFFENCE I HOPE SIR NONE AT ALL
AND BESIDES WE MUST SPEAK GENTLY FOR MAMMA IS ASLEEP
THEY WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY HAD TO BEAR TO ANY ONE WHO MIGHT FROM HIS POSITION HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT WITHOUT THEIR WORDS
HE RATHER LIKED HIM FOR IT
BOUCHER YO KNOW YES I KNOW NOW SAID MR HALE
I WILL USE MY BEST DISCRETION--FROM NO HUMBUG OR PHILANTHROPIC FEELING OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD RATHER TOO MUCH IN THE NORTH--TO MAKE WISE LAWS AND COME TO JUST DECISIONS IN THE CONDUCT OF MY BUSINESS--LAWS AND DECISIONS WHICH WORK FOR MY OWN GOOD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE--FOR THEIRS IN THE SECOND
MRS HALE SPOKE--SAID SOMETHING--MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT
I SHALL ALWAYS BE GLAD TO GET A LETTER FROM HELSTONE YOU KNOW
BUT HER WORDS DIED AWAY FOR THERE WAS NO TONE IN HER VOICE
AND HE HAD ALSO BOUGHT COTTON LARGELY WITH A VIEW TO SOME GREAT ORDERS WHICH HE HAD IN HAND
SHE GAVE WAY TO LISTLESS LANGUOR
AND HE FOLLOWED HER FOR SEVERAL YARDS ADMIRING HER LIGHT AND EASY WALK AND HER TALL AND GRACEFUL FIGURE
THEY WERE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY BY THIS TIME
WE'VE BEEN TOO BUSY TO ATTEND TO MERE OUTWARD APPEARANCES DON'T SAY MERE OUTWARD APPEARANCES SAID MR HALE GENTLY
SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY OR FACE DIFFICULTIES BRAVELY
WHY I MAY GIVE YOU AS AN INSTANCE AN ADVERTISEMENT INSERTED NOT FIFTY YEARS AGO IN A MILTON PAPER THAT SO-AND-SO ONE OF THE HALF-DOZEN CALICO-PRINTERS OF THE TIME WOULD CLOSE HIS WAREHOUSE AT NOON EACH DAY
YES SAID MR BELL
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED MR BELL AT LENGTH
CHAPTER XLVIII NE'ER TO BE FOUND AGAIN MY OWN MY FATHER'S FRIEND
I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY A MIND GETTING STIFF AND RIGID
AND SHE BREATHED FREELY AND HAPPILY AT LENGTH SEATED IN THE CARRIAGE OPPOSITE TO MR BELL AND WHIRLING AWAY PAST THE WELL-KNOWN STATIONS
ONLY WE SHALL HAVE LITTLE ENOUGH TO DO WITH THEM WHY ON EARTH HAS YOUR FATHER FIXED ON MILTON-NORTHERN TO LIVE IN PARTLY SAID MARGARET SIGHING BECAUSE IT IS SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE--PARTLY BECAUSE MR BELL SAYS THERE IS AN OPENING THERE FOR A PRIVATE TUTOR PRIVATE TUTOR IN MILTON
COLD MEAT WILL DO CAPITALLY FOR A LUNCH WHICH IS THE LIGHT IN WHICH MR LENNOX WILL MOST LIKELY LOOK UPON A TWO O'CLOCK DINNER BUT WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH HIM TILL THEN
MOTHER'S LOVE IS GIVEN BY GOD JOHN
THAT GIRL'S GAME TO THE BACK-BONE
HE IS EDITH'S HUSBAND'S BROTHER ISN'T HE
HE PLACED HER GENTLY ON THE DOOR-STEP HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST THE FRAME
AND THAT CURSED LIE
POOR FELLOW
POOR FELLOW
POOR FELLOW
POOR FELLOW
NOT FAR NOT DEEP
YO'RE SURE AND CERTAIN SHE'S DEAD--NOT IN A DWAM A FAINT?--SHE'S BEEN SO BEFORE OFTEN SHE IS DEAD REPLIED MARGARET
ONCE FOR ALL THEY SHALL KNOW WHOM THEY HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH
NO FEAR FOR TO-NIGHT--NAY EVEN PEACE FOR TO-MORROW AND FOR MANY DAYS YET
AND LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHO TRY AND TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S OUGHT FOR THE RULE OF THEIR FEELINGS SHE WAS INCLINED TO BLUSH FOR ANY SINGULARITY OF ACTION
THE PHILOSOPHER DIES SENTENTIOUSLY--THE PHARISEE OSTENTATIOUSLY--THE SIMPLE-HEARTED HUMBLY--THE POOR IDIOT BLINDLY AS THE SPARROW FALLS TO THE GROUND
OPEN IT
AN UNPUNCTUAL MEAL LAZILY EATEN BY WEARY AND HALF-AWAKE PEOPLE BUT YET AT WHICH IN ALL ITS DRAGGED-OUT LENGTH SHE WAS EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT BECAUSE DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS CAME A DISCUSSION OF PLANS AT WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY NONE OF THEM CONCERNED HER SHE WAS EXPECTED TO GIVE HER SYMPATHY IF SHE COULD NOT ASSIST WITH HER ADVICE
MR THORNTON DID NOT APPEAR TO HEAR WHAT MARGARET EVIDENTLY DID NOT WISH HIM TO KNOW
MARGARET WAS SILENCED AND SAD
I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE
AND UNTIL NOW WHEN THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING HIS CONNECTION WITH TWO OR THREE OF THE WORKMEN WHOM HE HAD SO LATELY BEGUN TO KNOW AS MEN,--OF HAVING A PLAN OR TWO WHICH WERE EXPERIMENTS LYING VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART ROUGHLY NIPPED OFF WITHOUT TRIAL,--GAVE A NEW POIGNANCY TO THE SUBTLE FEAR THAT CAME OVER HIM FROM TIME TO TIME
I KNOW SO WELL YOUR MOTHER'S MARRIED LIFE HAS NOT BEEN ALL SHE HOPED--ALL SHE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT--AND THIS WILL BE SUCH A BLOW TO HER THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD THE HEART THE POWER TO TELL HER
EH
EH
EH
EH
EH
FEW DRAPERS ASSISTANTS AS HE WAS ONCE COULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES WHAT HE IS BUT CAN YO GIVE DINNERS BACK IN YO'R SMALL HOUSE
I DARE SAY YOU HAVE BEEN SORRY FOR IT AND THAT YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN AND IT'S LONG AGO NOW AND IN SHORT I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CHEERFUL AND NOT VERY SAD THIS EVENING MARGARET WIPED HER EYES AND TRIED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT SUDDENLY SHE BURST OUT AFRESH
MARGARET'S FACE IN SPITE OF ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO KEEP IT SIMPLY LISTENING IN ITS EXPRESSION TOLD THE SENSITIVE MRS THORNTON THIS FEELING OF HERS
THE LANDLORD WILL PERSIST IN ADMIRING THAT HIDEOUS PAPER AND I AM AFRAID WE MUST LET IT REMAIN OH DEAR
AND IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO PLAGUE HER WITH GIVING HER ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD REALLY BE AN ANNOYANCE AND AN IRRITATION NO I SEE
HE CAN'T BEAR A WORD
IT HAD APPEARED A SUDDEN FAMINE TO HER HEART THIS ENTIRE CESSATION OF ANY NEWS RESPECTING THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM SHE HAD LIVED SO LONG
MASTER WAS BORN I SUPPOSE FOR TO MARRY MISSUS
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU MISS
HAVE YOU NOT HEARD I NEVER HEARD HIS NAME BEFORE
HE HAD COME IN WITHOUT HER NOTICING HIM
IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE STRONG PRIDE THAT WAS IN HER CAME TO CONQUER HER SUDDEN AGITATION WHICH SHE HOPED HE HAD NOT PERCEIVED
LEONARDS HIMSELF HAD GONE HALF-MAD WITH RAGE AND PAIN TO THE NEAREST GIN-PALACE FOR COMFORT
HE THOUGHT IT A PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE THE TWO COUSINS SO BUSY IN THEIR LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT THE TABLE
AND AS FOR THE OTHERS WE OWE THEM DINNERS AND IT'S ALL ONE TROUBLE HE KEPT ON WITH HIS RESTLESS WALK--NOT SPEAKING ANY MORE BUT DRAWING A DEEP BREATH FROM TIME TO TIME AS IF ENDEAVOURING TO THROW OFF SOME ANNOYING THOUGHT
FROM SOME CAUSE OR OTHER THERE WAS A PAUSE OF SEVERAL MINUTES IN THE UNSEEN STREET
HE HAD TO GIVE UP THE BUSINESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO LONG ENGAGED WITH SO MUCH HONOUR AND SUCCESS
HE THREW THE HAND AWAY WITH INDIGNATION AS HE HEARD HER ICY TONE
IT WAS BOLTED BUT THEY THOUGHT THEY HEARD HIM MOVING WITHIN
BUT MR THORNTON WOULD NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT MOVING THEIR QUARTERS
THEY ARE A ROUGH HEATHENISH SET OF FELLOWS THESE MILTON MEN OF YOURS THEY ARE THAT REPLIED MR THORNTON
FOR A FEW HOURS THE MOTHER RALLIED ON SEEING HER SON
GIVE ME TILL TO-MORROW EVENING TO CHOOSE MY TIME OH PAPA CRIED SHE WITH SUDDEN PASSIONATE ENTREATY SAY--TELL ME IT IS A NIGHT-MARE--A HORRID DREAM--NOT THE REAL WAKING TRUTH
IT WAS ONLY JOHN BOUCHER THAT TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER WHO CAME IN AND WHO WENT OUT
HE AS WELL AS THEY WAS SMILING AT A GOOD LONG SPIN
SHE COULD NOT ROUSE HER TORPID MIND INTO ANY VIVID IMAGINATION OF WHAT HER HUSBAND'S MISERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE HE HAD RESORTED TO THE LAST TERRIBLE STEP
BUT THIS POOR MRS BOUCHER
THE NEXT TIME EDITH FOUND DIXON LAYING OUT MARGARET'S DRESS ON THE BED
YOURS SINCERELY MARGARET HALE SHE SET OUT AGAIN UPON HER TRAVELS THROUGH THE HOUSE TURNING OVER ARTICLES KNOWN TO HER FROM HER CHILDHOOD WITH A SORT OF CARESSING RELUCTANCE TO LEAVE THEM--OLD-FASHIONED WORN AND SHABBY AS THEY MIGHT BE
OH YES SAID MARGARET
IT DUNNOT MATTER TO ME
AT FIRST SHE DID NOT ANSWER
WHY I'VE HAD THE VICAR HERE ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE SCHOOL
MR BELL WHOSE APPETITE HAD RETURNED AND WHO APPRECIATED DIXON'S ENDEAVOURS TO GRATIFY IT IN VAIN URGED UPON HER TO TASTE SOME SWEETBREADS STEWED WITH OYSTERS
HE HAD BEEN FATIGUED BY GOING ABOUT AMONG HIS OLD FRIENDS AND OLD FAMILIAR PLACES
YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON IF YO'D HA COME TO OUR HOUSE WHEN YO SAID YO WOULD I COULD MAYBE HA TOLD YOU
IF ALL THE WORLD SPOKE ACTED OR KEPT SILENCE WITH INTENT TO DECEIVE,--IF DEAREST INTERESTS WERE AT STAKE AND DEAREST LIVES IN PERIL,--IF NO ONE SHOULD EVER KNOW OF HER TRUTH OR HER FALSEHOOD TO MEASURE OUT THEIR HONOUR OR CONTEMPT FOR HER BY STRAIGHT ALONE WHERE SHE STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD SHE PRAYED THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE STRENGTH TO SPEAK AND ACT THE TRUTH FOR EVERMORE
MRS THORNTON CAME HURRIEDLY IN WITH THE NEAREST SURGEON SHE COULD FIND
IT MAKES ME THINK VERY BADLY OF CAPTAIN REID WHEN I KNOW THAT HE DISLIKED MY OWN DEAR BOY
I PROMISE THAT IN ANY DIFFICULTY IN WHICH MISS HALE CALL HER MARGARET GASPED MRS HALE
AND KEEP FATHER FRO DRINK YO'LL COME AND SEE HER MA'AM
THE PORTER OPENED THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY NOT NEARLY WIDE ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER
I BELIEVE IT BECAUSE IT ADDS A VALUE TO THAT LIFE TO THINK--OH MISS HALE CONTINUED HE LOWERING HIS VOICE TO SUCH A TENDER INTENSITY OF PASSION THAT SHE SHIVERED AND TREMBLED BEFORE HIM TO THINK CIRCUMSTANCE SO WROUGHT THAT WHENEVER I EXULT IN EXISTENCE HENCEFORWARD I MAY SAY TO MYSELF ALL THIS GLADNESS IN LIFE ALL HONEST PRIDE IN DOING MY WORK IN THE WORLD ALL THIS KEEN SENSE OF BEING I OWE TO HER AND IT DOUBLES THE GLADNESS IT MAKES THE PRIDE GLOW IT SHARPENS THE SENSE OF EXISTENCE TILL I HARDLY KNOW IF IT IS PAIN OR PLEASURE TO THINK THAT I OWE IT TO ONE--NAY YOU MUST YOU SHALL HEAR'--SAID HE STEPPING FORWARDS WITH STERN DETERMINATION--'TO ONE WHOM I LOVE AS I DO NOT BELIEVE MAN EVER LOVED WOMAN BEFORE HE HELD HER HAND TIGHT IN HIS
HER MANNER MORE GRACIOUS BECAUSE IN HER HEART SHE WAS FEELING VERY GRATEFUL TO MRS THORNTON FOR THE COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF HER CALL
NO MISS
AND AS FOR MARGARET IT WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD LEAVE HER MOTHER LET ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE WORLD SPEAK OF HUSBANDING RESOURCES AND ONE WATCHER ONLY BEING REQUIRED SO DIXON SAT AND STARED AND WINKED AND DROOPED AND PICKED HERSELF UP AGAIN WITH A JERK AND FINALLY GAVE UP THE BATTLE AND FAIRLY SNORED
DIXON WAS RATHER CAVALIERLY DISMISSING HIM
THAT HAS BEEN DONE THEN CAME A HURRIED MURMUR IN WHICH TWO OR THREE JOINED
BUT BY AND BY SHE WAS STRUCK WITH AN UNUSUAL HEAVING AMONG THE MASS OF PEOPLE IN THE CROWDED ROAD ON WHICH SHE WAS ENTERING
FOOTMAN OR NO FOOTMAN DON'T BE STRONG-MINDED DON'T BE AFRAID EDITH
AND THEN COMES IN THE SAME RESPECT FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE THAT I MYSELF EXACT HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN FOR A MINUTE HE WAS TOO MUCH VEXED
HE CANNOT
SOME DISPUTE AROSE WHICH WAS WARMLY CONTESTED
MRS SHAW AND CAPTAIN LENNOX EACH IN THEIR SEPARATE WAY GAVE MR BELL A KIND AND SINCERE WELCOME WINNING HIM OVER TO LIKE THEM ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAW HOW NATURALLY MARGARET TOOK HER PLACE AS SISTER AND DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE
HE'LL WORK HIS FINES WELL OUT ON EM I'LL WARRANT
TELL ME OUT I HAVE TELLED YO SAID HIGGINS A LITTLE SURPRISED AT MR HALE'S AGITATION
BUT PERHAPS HE WAS SPEAKING NOW
YOU THINK MISS HALE LOOKING WELL SAID MR LENNOX DON'T YOU
CHAPTER XLIX BREATHING TRANQUILLITY AND DOWN THE SUNNY BEACH SHE PACES SLOWLY WITH MANY DOUBTFUL PAUSES BY THE WAY
COME TO ME
SHE RECOLLECTED THE FIRST TEA UP THERE--SEPARATE FROM HER FATHER AND AUNT WHO WERE DINING SOMEWHERE DOWN BELOW AN INFINITE DEPTH OF STAIRS
OH JOHN SHE SAID AND SHE LIFTED HIS FACE UP
IT CERTAINLY SIGNIFIES VERY LITTLE TO US--NOT AT ALL TO YOU AFTER WHAT HAS PASSED
THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND THEY MIGHT HAVE GONE AWAY BELIEVING THE HOUSE TO BE EMPTY IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN SOME ACCIDENTAL FALL AS OF A BOOK WITHIN
THESE LADIES AND THEIR HUSBANDS WERE INVITED IN THEIR CAPACITY OF FRIENDS TO EAT A FAREWELL DINNER IN HONOUR OF EDITH'S APPROACHING MARRIAGE
I HAVE DONE WRONG BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK OR KNOW ABOUT
HE TOOK FREDERICK'S HAND IN BOTH OF HIS
BUT HE HAD PROMISED MARGARET TO DO IT AT ANY COST
BUT AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN HER SOME TEA SHE WAS REFRESHED THOUGH NOT DISPOSED TO TALK
I DARE SAY SIR MASTER WILL SEE YOU
I CHOOSE TO BE THE UNQUESTIONED AND IRRESPONSIBLE MASTER OF MY HANDS DURING THE HOURS THAT THEY LABOUR FOR ME
SHE HAD NOT FELT SO STUNNED--SO IMPRESSED AS SHE DID NOW WHEN ECHOES OF MR THORNTON'S VOICE YET LINGERED ABOUT THE ROOM
I AM SORRY TO SAY I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND I MUST JUST TAKE FACTS AS I FIND THEM TO-NIGHT WITHOUT TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM
IT WAS NOISY AND SMOKY AND THE POOR PEOPLE WHOM SHE SAW IN THE STREETS WERE DIRTY AND THE RICH LADIES OVER-DRESSED AND NOT A MAN THAT SHE SAW HIGH OR LOW HAD HIS CLOTHES MADE TO FIT HIM
MR BELL APPEARED FOR THE PRESENT TO BE STATIONARY AT OXFORD AND TO HAVE NO IMMEDIATE PURPOSE OF GOING TO MILTON AND SOME SECRET RESTRAINT SEEMED TO HANG OVER MARGARET AND PREVENT HER FROM EVEN ASKING OR ALLUDING AGAIN TO ANY PROBABILITY OF SUCH A VISIT ON HIS PART
IF IT WERE THE DEUCE'S OWN SCRIBBLE AND YO AXED ME TO READ IN IT FOR YO'R SAKE AND TH OUD GENTLEMAN'S I'D DO IT
THERE ARE GREAT TREES STANDING ALL ABOUT IT WITH THEIR BRANCHES STRETCHING LONG AND LEVEL AND MAKING A DEEP SHADE OF REST EVEN AT NOONDAY
THE BLESSING OF GOD BE UPON THEE MY CHILD AND MAY HE RESTORE YOU TO HIS CHURCH RESPONDED SHE OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HER HEART
JUST SUCH FEELINGS AS MARGARET WAS ASHAMED TO REMEMBER SHE HAD EXPRESSED AND FELT ON FIRST GOING TO LIVE THERE
I LIKE TO THINK OF YOU SO
MARGARET THOUGHT ABOUT HIM MORE THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
MARRIED FOR LOVE WHAT CAN DEAREST MARIA HAVE TO WISH FOR IN THIS WORLD MRS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY-MADE LIST A SILVER-GREY GLACE SILK A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH
I'LL NOT BE BOUND TO SAY I SHALL END IN THINKING THE SAME AS ANY MAN
HERE WE ARE AT THE ARCHERS SO OUT HE JUMPED WITH THOUGHT WISDOM EXPERIENCE SYMPATHY AND READY TO ATTEND TO THE CALLS MADE UPON THEM BY THIS FAMILY JUST AS IF THERE WERE NONE OTHER IN THE WORLD
MARGARET MUST COME AND LIVE WITH US
NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION
THE GRANDEUR AND REPOSE OF THE WORDS--"THE SAME YESTERDAY TO-DAY AND FOR EVER EVERLASTING
THAT HE HAD LOVED HER
HE AND THEY HAD LED PARALLEL LIVES--VERY CLOSE BUT NEVER TOUCHING--TILL THE ACCIDENT OR SO IT SEEMED OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIGGINS
SHE WISHED TO STAND WELL WITH MRS THORNTON
NOTHING COULD BE SAID TO CONSOLE HER
IS THAT YOU
MARGARET KNELT BY HIM CARESSING HIM WITH TEARFUL CARESSES
IT'S NOT OFTEN HOO'S STIRRED UP TO NOTICE MUCH CHAPTER XVIII LIKES AND DISLIKES MY HEART REVOLTS WITHIN ME AND TWO VOICES MAKE THEMSELVES AUDIBLE WITHIN MY BOSOM WALLENSTEIN
FREDERICK WAS SILENT FOR A TIME
AND FANCIED THAT FROM HER BEING ON A LOW SEAT AT FIRST AND NOW STANDING BEHIND HER FATHER HE HAD OVERLOOKED HER IN HIS HASTE
YOU COULD NOT STIR THEM UP INTO ANY COMPANIONSHIP WHICH YOU GET IN A TOWN AS PLENTIFUL AS THE AIR YOU BREATHE WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR BAD--AND THAT I DON'T KNOW
STILL THERE WERE SOME WISER PARENTS
SHE WAS A LITTLE MOLLIFIED HOWEVER WHEN HE LOOKED AT HIS FEET WITH A HESITATING AIR
I DO IT FOR YO'R SAKE MISS HALE AND IT'S FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AS E'ER I GIVE WAY TO A WOMAN
IN SUCH CASES EVIDENCE ITSELF CAN HARDLY ESCAPE BEING INFLUENCED BY THE PRESTIGE OF AUTHORITY BUT IS IT NOT WORTH TRYING TO SEE HOW MUCH EVIDENCE MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND ARRAYED ON YOUR BEHALF
DADDY HAD BEEN A KIND DADDY TO THEM
IT WAS THE TRUTH THEY CONVEYED PUNGENTLY AS IT WAS EXPRESSED
THEN SHE STARTED UP AND EXCLAIMED THEY'RE AT THE GATES
WHAT'S MINE'S THINE SURE ENOUGH I THOU'ST I WANT
AND REMEMBER MY DEAR WHERE YOU MAY FIND A TRUE FRIEND AS FAR AS HIS CAPABILITY GOES
FOR CREDIT WAS INSECURE AND THE MOST STABLE MIGHT HAVE THEIR FORTUNES AFFECTED BY THE SWEEP IN THE GREAT NEIGHBOURING PORT AMONG THE SHIPPING HOUSES
READ ME--NOT A SERMON CHAPTER BUT A STORY CHAPTER
COME MISS HALE--COME MY DEAR
BUT I COULD NOT HAVE COME YESTERDAY MY MOTHER WAS SO ILL--FOR MANY REASONS SAID MARGARET COLOURING
SAME BONES WON'T GO DOWN WI EVERY ONE
SITTING UP IN HER BED-ROOM THIS PAST AUTUMN WITH THE LIGHT OF HER CANDLE EXTINGUISHED AND PURELY REVELLING IN THE SOLEMN BEAUTY OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH SHE HAD MANY A TIME SEEN THE LIGHT NOISELESS LEAP OF THE POACHERS OVER THE GARDEN-FENCE THEIR QUICK TRAMP ACROSS THE DEWY MOONLIT LAWN THEIR DISAPPEARANCE IN THE BLACK STILL SHADOW BEYOND
I THINK MYSELF I HAVE SUCCEEDED PRETTY WELL IN YOURS MR HALE HAD PRECEDED THEM INTO THE HOUSE WHILE MARGARET WAS LINGERING TO PLUCK SOME ROSES WITH WHICH TO ADORN HER MORNING GOWN FOR DINNER
BUT THAT'S MAYBE BEEN A HASTY JUDGMENT
THEN HE TURNED TO MARGARET
IT IS THE AIR OF THIS ROOM THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO MISERABLE SHE LEANT BACK ON THE SOFA AND CLOSED HER EYES
PLAYING WITH SHAWLS IS VERY DIFFERENT WORK TO DRAWING UP SETTLEMENTS
LET ME PASS
SHE HAD BEEN SORRY THAT AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OTHER FEELING THAN FRIENDSHIP HAD BEEN LURED OUT BY CIRCUMSTANCES FROM HENRY LENNOX
NOT MORE THAN THIRTY-SIX HOURS AGO SHE CARED FOR BESSY HIGGINS AND HER FATHER AND HER HEART WAS WRUNG FOR BOUCHER
AND I WOULD GIVE MY HEART'S BLOOD TO DO THAT
THEIR TWO NIGHTS AT HOTELS HAD COST MORE THAN MR HALE HAD ANTICIPATED AND THEY WERE GLAD TO TAKE THE FIRST CLEAN CHEERFUL ROOMS THEY MET WITH THAT WERE AT LIBERTY TO RECEIVE THEM
NO ONE HAS EVER SHALL EVER TRY SO HARD AS I WILL DO
DID NOT ATTEND TO WHAT MR BELL WENT ON TO SAY
I DUNNOT STOMACH THE NOTION OF HAVING FAVOUR CURRIED FOR ME BY ONE AS DOESN'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF THE QUARREL
I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE TAKEN COLD
NOW KILL ME IF IT IS YOUR BRUTAL WILL
AND YOU HAVE RESTED A LITTLE SHE SAT DOWN HASTILY WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND ALLOWED IT TO BE BOUND UP
HE THOUGHT TO HAVE SEEN HER WINCE
WHILE I WAS THERE I WAS FOR EVER WANTING TO LEAVE IT
I WONDER WHAT SUCCESS HE'LL HAVE TO-MORROW
WHENCE HARMONIES WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND OF GOD'S WILL IN HIS WORLDS THE STRAIN UNFOLDS IN SAD PERPLEXED MINORS MRS
THEN SHE AROSE AND WENT WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD OR LOOK TOWARDS THE DOOR
WHENEVER I HAVE SEEN YOU LATELY YOU HAVE BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY A WHIRLWIND OF SOME OTHER PERSON'S MAKING YES SAID MARGARET RATHER SADLY REMEMBERING THE NEVER-ENDING COMMOTION ABOUT TRIFLES THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR MORE THAN A MONTH PAST
MARY'S FACE WAS ALL SWOLLEN WITH CRYING AND SHE BURST OUT AFRESH WHEN SHE SAW MARGARET
AND WHERE THE GREEN GLOOM AND DELICIOUS QUIET OF THE PLACE HAD CONDUCED AS HE HAD SAID TO A HABIT OF MEDITATION BUT PERHAPS IN SOME DEGREE TO THE FORMATION OF A CHARACTER MORE FITTED FOR THOUGHT THAN ACTION
NOR MUST THOU SO LIMIT THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL AS TO THINK HE HATH BUT ONE WAY IN WHICH HE CAN GLORIFY HIMSELF BY THEE
WHY THERE PAPA ASKED SHE
SOME WITH LONG STREAKS OF GOLDEN SUNLIGHT LYING ON THEM--JUST LIKE THE SEA I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SEA MURMURED BESSY
WHEN HER BROTHER AND MR BELL CAME IN FANNY BLUSHED AND SIMPERED AND FLUTTERED OVER THE SIGNS OF HER EMPLOYMENT IN A WAY WHICH COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO DRAW ATTENTION FROM ANY ONE ELSE BUT MR BELL
SPEECH BY SPEECH SHE COMPELLED HER MEMORY TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
MRS THORNTON DID NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY
IT WOULD KILL YOU WITH RHEUMATISM
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO CURIOUS MISS AND THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED TO FRET BEFORE YOUR TIME
THEY MAY NEED IT
LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS
THE QUICK ZEST WITH WHICH YOU ARE NOW READING HOMER SHOWS ME THAT YOU DO NOT COME TO IT AS AN UNKNOWN BOOK
WAS IT THAT HE PAUSED IN THE EXPRESSION OF SOME REMEMBERED AGONY MR THORNTON'S TWO OR THREE WORDS WOULD COMPLETE THE SENTENCE AND SHOW HOW DEEPLY ITS MEANING WAS ENTERED INTO
LET ME BE YOUR NURSE
LET ME BE YOUR NURSE
SHE HAD BEEN SO SUBDUED IN HER GRIEF SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO GENTLE AND PATIENT IN ALL THINGS THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HER IMPATIENT WAYS TO-NIGHT
ALL THE DAY LONG SHE KEPT HERSELF FROM THINKING OF THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS GOING ON AT OXFORD BY WANDERING FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND LANGUIDLY SETTING ASIDE SUCH ARTICLES AS SHE WISHED TO RETAIN
ON MR HALE I MEAN
MEDDLING TWIXT MASTER AND MAN IS LIKER MEDDLING TWIXT HUSBAND AND WIFE THAN AUGHT ELSE
DON'T THINK THAT I AM IMPERTINENTLY CURIOUS
WE WERE IN THE FRONT GARRET AND COULD SEE IT ALL OUT OF HARM'S WAY WHERE WAS SHE THEN SAID FANNY DRAWING NEARER BY SLOW DEGREES AS SHE BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE SIGHT OF MARGARET'S PALE FACE
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL MR LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE
IT WAS ONE OF MRS HALE'S FITFUL DAYS WHEN EVERYTHING WAS A DIFFICULTY AND A HARDSHIP
MR GREY WAS PARTICULARLY AGREEABLE OVER THIS FAREWELL DINNER AND THE GENTLEMEN STAID DOWN STAIRS LONGER THAN USUAL
BUT WHERE ARE THE OTHERS
IT WAS A COMFORT TO MARGARET ABOUT THIS TIME TO FIND THAT HER MOTHER DREW MORE TENDERLY AND INTIMATELY TOWARDS HER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE SINCE THE DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD
HE LEANT HIS FACE AGAINST HIS HAND
LET HER GO AND THERE WAS NO TONE OF REGRET OR EMOTION OF ANY KIND IN THE VOICE WITH WHICH HE SAID GOOD-BYE
ALL THE MORE COMPLETE AND BEAUTIFUL WAS HER MEEK SPIRIT OF OBEDIENCE
SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO THE INSPECTOR AND PRECEDED HIM INTO THE STUDY
CHAPTER XXVII FRUIT-PIECE FOR NEVER ANY THING CAN BE AMISS WHEN SIMPLENESS AND DUTY TENDER IT MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
DUNNA YO HOPE MISS
SHE WONDERED IF THE MAN HAD GOT UP
LEAD HER FROM THE FESTIVE BOARDS POINT HER TO THE STARRY SKIES GUARD HER BY YOUR TRUTHFUL WORDS PURE FROM COURTSHIP'S FLATTERIES MRS
VERY WELL
VERY WELL
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE NO HAY NOR CORN TO SELL THAT YEAR
AND HER HEAD ACHED INTENSELY
THE SMALL LAWN WAS GORGEOUS WITH VERBENAS AND GERANIUMS OF ALL BRIGHT COLOURS
SHE MIGHT THEN POSSIBLY HEAR WHETHER NICHOLAS HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIS APPLICATION TO MR THORNTON
THAT WAS GOOD WASN'T IT YES
TO SEE YOU CAST DOWN FROM YOUR RIGHTFUL PLACE
THERE'S NO TIME TO BE LOST
CHAPTER XXI THE DARK NIGHT ON EARTH IS KNOWN TO NONE THE SMILE THAT IS NOT SISTER TO A TEAR ELLIOTT
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
MARGARET WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
IN THE FIRST PLACE MARGARET WHO IS TO HUNT UP MY WITNESSES
HE WENT OFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FALL WHICH WE NEVER THOUGHT COULD HAVE DONE THE POOR FELLOW ANY HARM IT SEEMED SO SLIGHT AN INJURY THEN HE DID NOT DIE DIRECTLY NO
BUT MAMMA WAS SEIZED WITH SUCH A PASSIONATE YEARNING TO SEE HIM--SHE SAID IT WOULD MAKE HER WELL AGAIN,--AND THEN SHE SAID THAT SHE MUST SEE HIM BEFORE SHE DIED,--I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW URGENT SHE WAS
I MUST MAKE MYSELF BUSY TO KEEP OFF MORBID THOUGHTS
I DARE SAY HIS COMING WILL DO PAPA GOOD
AND THEN WHAT SHALL I DO
PLEASE GOD I'LL COME AND SEE YO OH BESSY
BUT SHE WAS RESOLVED TO THROW HERSELF INTO THE BREACH IF THERE WAS ANY LONG UNTOWARD PAUSE RATHER THAN THAT HER FATHER'S FRIEND PUPIL AND GUEST SHOULD HAVE CAUSE TO THINK HIMSELF IN ANY WAY NEGLECTED
THOSE SEEMED THEIR MOST SEVERE AND ARDUOUS DUTIES
MR HALE CAME--AS IF IN A DREAM OR RATHER WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS MOTION OF A SLEEP-WALKER WHOSE EYES AND MIND PERCEIVE OTHER THINGS THAN WHAT ARE PRESENT
AND HOW SHE HAD CRIED AS BITTERLY BUT MORE QUIETLY TILL HER NEWLY-SEEN GRAND PRETTY AUNT HAD COME SOFTLY UPSTAIRS WITH MR HALE TO SHOW HIM HIS LITTLE SLEEPING DAUGHTER
WE THOUGHT IT MUST BE SOME MISTAKE
HER EYELIDS WERE DROPPED HALF OVER HER EYES
THE BROWS WERE FINELY ARCHED BUT WERE BY THE VERY SIZE OF THE DREAMY LIDS RAISED TO A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE EYES
MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
AND POOR GENTLEMAN HE GOES ABOUT NOW AS IF HE WAS LOST
BUT THAT LOOK OF DESPONDENT UNCERTAINTY OF MENTAL AND BODILY LANGUOR TOUCHED HIS WIFE'S HEART
YO'VE BEEN TRUE TO YO'R ORDER AND I'LL BE TRUE TO MINE
AND HAD EVEN O'ERLEAPED HIMSELF SO MUCH THAT HE ASSUMED A SORT OF BITTER MIRTH LIKE THE CRACKLING OF THORNS UNDER A POT
YOU'RE A FAMOUS WORKMAN ARE NOT YOU HAMPER'LL LET ME WORK AT HIS MILL WHEN HE CUTS OFF HIS RIGHT HAND--NOT BEFORE AND NOT AFTER SAID NICHOLAS QUIETLY
HE WAS GLAD TO CATCH THE SOUND OF MR THORNTON'S VOICE MAKING ENQUIRY AT THE DOOR
WHEN THEY RETURNED TO TOWN MARGARET FULFILLED ONE OF HER SEA-SIDE RESOLVES AND TOOK HER LIFE INTO HER OWN HANDS
COME MISS HALE
STAY I WILL MOVE AND THEN YOU CAN COME NEARER THIS WAY
AND THE LADIES WERE SO DULL PAPA--OH SO DULL
TO BE SURE SHE HAS WRITTEN IN SUCH A HURRY LATELY
WHAT CAN HE MEAN THOUGHT MARGARET,--'WHAT COULD HE MEAN BY SPEAKING SO AS IF I WERE ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE CARED FOR ME WHEN I KNOW HE DOES NOT
THAT HORROCKS--THAT VERY LAST WITNESS OF ALL HAS PROVED AS UNAVAILING AS ALL THE OTHERS
HE HAS JUST COME IN WITH NEWS OF SUCH A CHARMING PIC-NIC GIVEN BY THE OFFICERS OF THE HAZARD AT ANCHOR IN THE BAY BELOW
I DID BEAR IT
I HAVE HAD NO YOUTH--NO WOMANHOOD
HE WAS A MAGISTRATE AND HE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT THE FALL THAT HAD CAUSED THE DEATH
WHAT ILL-FATE BROUGHT HIM IN CONTACT WITH THE INSPECTOR
COVERED UP HER FACE AND TURNED TO FOLLOW MARGARET
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND MY OWN--IT MAY BE ALL GONE AND I PENNILESS AT THIS MOMENT
MARGARET WENT ALONG THE WALK UNDER THE PEAR-TREE WALL
BUT SHE!--WHY MARGARET WOULD NEVER THINK OF HIM I'M SURE
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE TOOK BOOKS AND PAPERS INTO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM AND SATE UP THERE LONG AFTER THE FAMILY WERE GONE TO BED
WHEN THE PENNY STOPPED SPINNING LILE JOHNNIE BEGAN TO CRY
DON'T IMAGINE SUCH THINGS SAID MARGARET SHOCKED
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW SIR THAT THAT MAN IS HIGGINS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE UNION
AND MARGARET WAS GLAD TO HEAR A QUOTATION ONCE MORE HOWEVER LANGUIDLY GIVEN
AT LAST THE LATCH WAS SHARPLY LIFTED AND OUT CAME MR THORNTON
EDITH WROTE FLUENTLY AND WELL IF NOT GRAPHICALLY
ALL YOUR LIVES SEEM TO BE SPENT IN GATHERING TOGETHER THE MATERIALS FOR LIFE BY LIVING I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN ENJOYMENT YES ENJOYMENT,--I DON'T SPECIFY OF WHAT BECAUSE I TRUST WE SHOULD BOTH CONSIDER MERE PLEASURE AS VERY POOR ENJOYMENT I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE NATURE OF THE ENJOYMENT DEFINED WELL
ONCE LET IN THE PRINCIPLE AND I SHOULD HAVE PEOPLE GOING AND TALKING AND SPOILING THE SIMPLICITY OF THE WHOLE THING PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT ANY NEW PLAN
MARGARET WENT ALONG WITHOUT NOTICING ANYTHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM USUAL IN THE FIRST MILE AND A HALF OF HER JOURNEY
I AM IN THE MOOD IN WHICH WOMEN OF ANOTHER RELIGION TAKE THE VEIL
ONLY ONCE SHE CRIED ALOUD AT THE STINGING THOUGHT OF THE FAITHLESSNESS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THAT ABASING FALSEHOOD
WHAT KIND ARE THEY
CONSEQUENTLY AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION FREDERICK HAD DETERMINED UPON REMAINING IN LONDON A DAY OR TWO LONGER
ALL THE OTHER PLACES IN ENGLAND THAT I HAVE SEEN SEEM SO HARD AND PROSAIC-LOOKING AFTER THE NEW FOREST
AND THOUGH SHE WINCED AS SHE MADE THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO HERSELF ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IT ONLY GAVE HER A KIND OF PITYING TENDERNESS OF MANNER TOWARDS HER
NICHOLAS WORE HIS USUAL FUSTIAN CLOTHES BUT HAD A BIT OF BLACK STUFF SEWN ROUND HIS HAT--A MARK OF MOURNING WHICH HE HAD NEVER SHOWN TO HIS DAUGHTER BESSY'S MEMORY
THEY ARE OF A KIND THAT HE WILL VALUE FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS FOR PAPA'S SAKE
IT WAS VERY PROBABLY BUT THE FANCY OF A MOMENT,--BUT IF IT WERE TRUE WHAT A BRIGHT OUTLET IT WOULD BE FROM THE MONOTONY OF HER PRESENT LIFE WHICH WAS BEGINNING TO FALL UPON HER
THEY WOULD TRY AND GET SPEECH O TH KNOBSTICKS AND COAX EM AND REASON WI EM AND M'APPEN WARN EM OFF
AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD A LETTER FROM EDITH WHICH SHE HAD ONLY HALF READ IN THE BUSTLE OF THE MORNING
BESIDES WAS MARGARET ONE TO GIVE WAY BEFORE STRANGE MEN OR EVEN HOUSEHOLD FRIENDS LIKE THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE
MRS THORNTON WENT ON
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU I MEAN THAT AFTER ALLOWING HER FEELINGS SO TO OVERCOME HER I CONSIDER YOU BOUND IN HONOUR BOUND IN HONOUR SAID HE SCORNFULLY
MR HIGGINS I TRUST WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE GIVEN UP YOU BELIEVE'--(MR HALE'S VOICE DROPPED LOW IN REVERENCE)--'YOU BELIEVE IN HIM NICHOLAS HIGGINS SUDDENLY STOOD STRAIGHT STIFF UP
THESE LAST FEW YEARS SAID HE
THE TIME AND PLACE IN WHICH HE LIVES SEEM TO ME TO REQUIRE ALL HIS ENERGY AND ATTENTION
MR THORNTON WE WERE ACCUSING MR BELL THIS MORNING OF A KIND OF OXONIAN MEDIAEVAL BIGOTRY AGAINST HIS NATIVE TOWN
SHE HAS I AM SURE THAT TRUST IN YOU THAT WE ALL HAVE
MR BELL WENT DOWN TO MEET MRS SHAW
AND HAMPER MET ME ONE DAY IN TH YARD
THE HABITUAL DINNERS THE CALLS THE SHOPPING THE DANCING EVENINGS WERE ALL GOING ON GOING ON FOR EVER THOUGH HER AUNT SHAW AND EDITH WERE NO LONGER THERE
AND DIXON'S REPORT TO MRS SHAW WAS THAT SHE DOUBTED WHETHER MISS HALE HEARD A WORD OF WHAT SHE SAID THOUGH SHE TALKED THE WHOLE TIME IN ORDER TO DIVERT HER ATTENTION THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING ON HER FEET ALL DAY WAS EXCESSIVE BODILY WEARINESS IN THE EVENING AND A BETTER NIGHT'S REST THAN SHE HAD HAD SINCE SHE HAD HEARD OF MR HALE'S DEATH
MRS THORNTON SUBMITTED WITH AS BAD A GRACE AS SHE COULD TO HER SON'S DESIRE ALL THE TIME LIKING HIM THE BETTER FOR HAVING IT
CERTAINLY NOT
IT WAS THROWING MORE CHANCES OF DETECTION IN HIS WAY
YET IT WAS PAIN SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITHOUT
HERE IS HIS BIBLE
ONLY YOU MUST PAY ME FOR THEM HOW SHALL I EVER TELL AUNT SHAW SHE WHISPERED AFTER SOME TIME OF DELICIOUS SILENCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DECOROUS KIND-HEARTED SIMPLE OLD-FASHIONED GENTLEMAN HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY CALLED OUT BY HIS OWN REFINEMENT AND COURTEOUSNESS OF MANNER ALL THE LATENT COURTESY IN THE OTHER
THIS TAUGHT ME SELF-DENIAL
SHE AND HER FATHER KEPT UP AN INDIFFERENT CONVERSATION UNTIL HIGGINS SCARCELY AWARE WHETHER HE ATE OR NOT HAD MADE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
MAMMA'S APPETITE IS PRETTY GOOD I THINK YES
AND WHAT ARE THE UNION'S WAYS AND MEANS HE LOOKED UP AT HER AS IF ON THE POINT OF DOGGED RESISTANCE TO HER WISH FOR INFORMATION
THERE WOULD BE NOBODY TO MEET HIM I'M SURE HE WOULD MUCH RATHER COME AND DINE WITH US QUITE ALONE THAN WITH THE MOST AGREEABLE STRANGERS YOU COULD PICK UP
NAY THERE WERE A FEW NO LONGER YOUTHS BUT MEN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE WHO HAD THE STERN WISDOM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND TO LEARN LATE WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE LEARNT EARLY
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
NOTHING INDEED
WITH MY BROTHER
SHE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO GET SPEECH O THEM WHEN THEY'RE A BIT INCLINED TO SIT STILL AFTER DINNER AND COULD NA RUN FOR THE LIFE ON EM
WE HAD PUBLIC OPINION ON OUR SIDE TILL HE AND HIS SORT BEGAN RIOTING AND BREAKING LAWS
AND ON CAPTAIN LENNOX'S REPLY THAT HE HAD QUITE ENOUGH TO LIVE UPON SHE HAD SEEN MR LENNOX'S CURL OF THE LIP AS HE SAID AND IS THAT ALL YOU LIVE FOR BUT THE BROTHERS WERE MUCH ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER IN THE WAY THAT ANY TWO PERSONS ARE WHEN THE ONE IS CLEVERER AND ALWAYS LEADS THE OTHER AND THIS LAST IS PATIENTLY CONTENT TO BE LED
MR HALE LOOKED AT HER FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT A WORD
MARGARET BOWED
COME THIS WAY MISS SAID DIXON OPENING THE DOOR OF WHAT HAD BEEN MRS HALE'S BED-CHAMBER NOW MARGARET'S FOR HER FATHER REFUSED TO SLEEP THERE AGAIN AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH
OR GO BACK BY THE RAIL-ROAD WHEN I SHOULD HAVE SHOPS AND PEOPLE AND LAMPS ALL THE WAY FROM THE MILTON STATION-HOUSE
THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE WORKED AWAY WITH WILLING ARMS AND STOUT HEARTS AT ALL THE MOVING AND PACKING
THERE WAS A BROAD CINDER-PATH DIAGONALLY CROSSING A FIELD WHICH LAY ALONG-SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE-ROAD AND THEY WENT THERE TO WALK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FOR THE FEW MINUTES THEY HAD TO SPARE
BUT YOU KNOW I AM YOUR CHILD AND I DO THINK I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID MRS HALE WITH A SHUDDER
SHE STARTED UP AS HER MOTHER ENTERED
ONE WAS A NOTE FOR HER MOTHER,--THE OTHER WHICH HAD COME BY THE POST WAS EVIDENTLY FROM HER AUNT SHAW--COVERED WITH FOREIGN POST-MARKS--THIN SILVERY AND RUSTLING
MAKE NO NOISE--BE VERY STILL
I HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS AND HAVE HAD TO GIVE UP MY POSITION AS A MASTER
AR T GOING TO DINE AT THORNTON'S
MRS HALE WENT OUT TO CONSULT WITH DIXON ABOUT SOME WINTER CLOTHING FOR THE POOR
I MUST TRY TO BE MEEK ENOUGH TO TRUST
WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER I RATHER FANCY THERE WILL BE TWO PEOPLE WAITING FOR HER
ASK DIXON FOR SOME GRUEL
BUT IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WAS SURPRISED AT THE GUSH OF FRESH AIR
MARGARET SAT DOWN ON A BOX THE DIRECTION CARD UPON WHICH STRUCK HER AS HAVING BEEN WRITTEN AT HELSTONE--BEAUTIFUL BELOVED HELSTONE
IN THOSE DAYS OF SORE OPPRESSION TH UNIONS BEGAN
I AM MYSELF A BORN AND BRED LADY THROUGH IT ALL EVEN THOUGH IT COMES TO SCOURING A FLOOR OR WASHING DISHES
SEEING NO ONE BUT FARMERS AND LABOURERS FROM WEEK'S END TO WEEK'S END
AND SO DID POOR HALE
I WAS VERY MUCH INTERESTED BY WHAT THE GENTLEMEN WERE TALKING ABOUT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HALF OF IT
I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF YOU HAD FELT THAT YOU COULD RETURN HIS REGARD
IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING,--FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE
NOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WOULDN'T YOU SAID HE
THEY COULD NOT BE WORSE
WHO ONLY WANTED THEIR RIGHT WAGE AND WOULDN'T WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY STARVED TILL THEY GOT EM
MY POOR POOR MOTHER HER LIPS BEGAN TO QUIVER AND HE LET HER HAVE THE RELIEF OF TEARS SURE OF HER POWER OF SELF-CONTROL TO CHECK THEM
THOU KNOW'ST NOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL SAID HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
THE DREAM WAS SO LIKE LIFE THAT WHEN HE AWOKE HIS PRESENT LIFE SEEMED LIKE A DREAM
I SUPPOSE I MAY HOPE TO SEE HIM ON THURSDAY I CANNOT ANSWER FOR MY SON'S ENGAGEMENTS
AND MANY A CURT DECIDED ANSWER WAS RECEIVED BY THEM RATHER WITH SYMPATHY FOR THE CARE THEY SAW PRESSING UPON HIM THAN WITH THE SUPPRESSED ANTAGONISM WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN SMOULDERING AND READY FOR HARD WORDS AND HARD JUDGMENTS ON ALL OCCASIONS
MR THORNTON AT FIRST WAS PUZZLED TO ACCOUNT FOR HER SILENCE
SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM CHANGE
AND BEFORE THE TRAIN HAD GOT TO ITS FULL SPEED AFTER STARTING HE HAD BEEN ALMOST KNOCKED DOWN BY THE HEADLONG RUN OF THE ENRAGED HALF INTOXICATED LEONARDS SWEARING AND CURSING AWFULLY
WITH SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF RESOLUTION AND POWER NO FACE HOWEVER PLAIN IN FEATURE COULD BE EITHER VULGAR OR COMMON
IRRITATED BY THE MENTION OF SOME NAME BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT BELONGED TO A MORE SUCCESSFUL LOVER
I KNOW YOU DESPISE ME
HE WOULD NEITHER SEEK AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING IN HER COMPANY NOR AVOID IT
IT SEEMS HARD TO LOSE HIM AS A FRIEND JUST WHEN I HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HIS VALUE
PERHAPS SO
SHE WAS DISPLEASED WITH HIS PERTINACITY BUT DID NOT CHOOSE TO AFFIX TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER WORDS
SHE HAS NEVER EXPRESSED ANY WISH IN ANY WAY AND ONLY THINKS OF WHAT CAN'T BE HELPED
THERE WERE THREE SITTING-ROOMS
HE DID NOT KNOW MARGARET HALE
SHE SAT AT HER WORK IN MRS HALE'S ROOM
I HOPE AND TRUST HE IS NOT THINKING OF HER FOR I AM SURE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM WELL
WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE WORDS DIFFERENTLY I TAKE IT THAT GENTLEMAN IS A TERM THAT ONLY DESCRIBES A PERSON IN HIS RELATION TO OTHERS
ALL ON US MUST SIN
BUT ARTER ALL HIS BARK'S WAUR THAN HIS BITE AND YO MAY TELL HIM ONE O HIS TURN-OUTS SAID SO IF YO LIKE
NO REPLIED MARGARET SOMEWHAT ANNOYED I AM NOT MAKING A PICTURE
IT WAS SO DIFFERENT TO ALL WHICH MARGARET HAD HOPED AND EXPECTED THAT SHE TURNED SICK WITH DISAPPOINTMENT AND WAS SILENT FOR AN INSTANT
IS THERE ANY ONE WHO WILL GO FOR A DOCTOR NOT ME MA'AM IF YOU PLEASE SAID JANE SHRINKING BACK
I DO NOT KNOW
I COULD GO O'ER HIM WI A PLOUGH MYSEL WI A THE PLEASURE IN LIFE WHY
I'M BLASPHEMING ALL THE TIME IN MY MIND WI THINKING ANGRILY ON WHAT CANNA BE HELPED.--YO'D HEAR OF TH RIOT M'APPEN YESTERDAY AT MARLBOROUGH MILLS
HOW LONG IT WAS SINCE THEY HAD HEARD FROM HIM
HE MINCED UP SOME OF THE FOWL FOR MARGARET AND PEPPERED AND SALTED IT WELL
I DON'T BELIEVE A COUSIN OF YOURS COULD EXAGGERATE IS MISS HALE SO REMARKABLE FOR TRUTH SAID MR THORNTON BITTERLY
THEN HE CAME AND STOOD CLOSE TO MR HALE
SHE IS UNJUSTLY TREATED BY YOU AND I MUST MAKE THE BALANCE EVEN
NOT EVEN IN HAMPSHIRE--SINCE I WAS A BOY
AMONG THEM SHE CAME TO FOUR OR FIVE OF MR HENRY LENNOX'S RELATING TO FREDERICK'S AFFAIRS
SHE WAS SILENT BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING TO TASK HERSELF UP TO HER DUTY
SHE FELT A TINGE OF CONTEMPT MINGLE ITSELF WITH HER PAIN AT HAVING REFUSED HIM
BUT THE VERY BUSINESS OF WHICH I SPOKE WHEN YOU ENTERED HAD REFERENCE TO THE STEPS HE IS GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE THEM LEARN THEIR PLACE THE EXPRESSION ON HER FACE ALWAYS STERN DEEPENED INTO DARK ANGER AS SHE SAID THIS
MISS HALE IS AT LIBERTY TO PLEASE HERSELF I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SAID MRS THORNTON EAGERLY
EACH WAS URGING THE OTHER ON TO SOME IMMEDIATE ACT OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE
HE VALUES THE HOURS SPENT WITH YOU I AM SURE THEY ARE EQUALLY AGREEABLE TO ME SAID MR HALE
AND--HE DREW ME OUT A PROPOSAL--I WISH HE WAS HERE TO EXPLAIN IT--SHOWING THAT IF YOU WOULD TAKE SOME MONEY OF MINE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND FIFTY-SEVEN POUNDS LYING JUST AT THIS MOMENT UNUSED IN THE BANK AND BRINGING ME IN ONLY TWO AND A HALF PER CENT.--YOU COULD PAY ME MUCH BETTER INTEREST AND MIGHT GO ON WORKING MARLBOROUGH MILLS HER VOICE HAD CLEARED ITSELF AND BECOME MORE STEADY
SHE WANTED TO MAKE FREDERICK UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF PERSON MR THORNTON WAS--BUT SHE WAS TONGUE-TIED
HE TOO SEEMED BY HIS MANNERS TO HAVE ENTERED A LITTLE MORE ON THE WAY OF HUMILITY
MARGARET'S HEART ACHED TO SEE HIM
YO'RE PRETTY SURE OF FINDING ME ARE YOU OUT OF WORK ASKED MARGARET
HE HAD UNBARRED THE FRONT DOOR
THOSE WERE MARGARET'S SWEETEST MOMENTS
THE SERVANTS RETREATED INTO THE GARRETS WITH MANY A CRY AND SHRIEK
ALREADY ONE OR TWO KEPT CONSTANTLY FLOATING DOWN AMBER AND GOLDEN IN THE LOW SLANTING SUN-RAYS
I RECKON NOT WELL
FOR IDLE BREATH MAY AT SUCH TIMES CAUSE THE DOWNFALL OF SOME WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE WEATHER THE STORM
NICHOLAS--CLEAN TIDIED IF ONLY AT THE PUMP-TROUGH AND QUIET SPOKEN--WAS A NEW CREATURE TO HER WHO HAD ONLY SEEN HIM IN THE ROUGH INDEPENDENCE OF HIS OWN HEARTHSTONE
AND WHERE HER BRIGHT HOLIDAYS HAD ALWAYS BEEN PASSED THOUGH FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS HER AUNT SHAW'S HOUSE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED AS HER HOME
AND HE WOULD ASSUREDLY FOLLOW QUICKLY ON ITS HEELS
MR BELL'S INVITATION INCLUDED MARGARET
IT WAS THE FRANK FAMILIAR CUSTOM OF THE PLACE
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHO THEY WERE
SHE HEARD HIM WHISPER
WHEN HE HAD COME TO THEIR HOUSE THERE HAD BEEN ALWAYS SOMETHING EITHER OF OVER-EAGERNESS OR OF THAT KIND OF VEXED ANNOYANCE WHICH SEEMED READY TO PRE-SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS UNJUSTLY JUDGED AND YET FELT TOO PROUD TO TRY AND MAKE HIMSELF BETTER UNDERSTOOD
BUT HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT YOU--HOW SHALL I SAY IT?--THAT YOU WERE NOT UNGRACIOUSLY DISPOSED TOWARDS MR THORNTON
I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE
THE DIRECTORS ADMIT SO INDISCRIMINATELY
I BELIEVE IT WILL BE CAPITAL AFTER ALL
THE THICK YELLOW NOVEMBER FOGS HAD COME ON
THERE'S BUT ONE THING STEADY AND QUIET I ALL THIS REELING WORLD AND REASON OR NO REASON I'LL CLING TO THAT
I DARE SAY IT WAS A COMFORT TO HIM TO WRITE IT EVEN THOUGH HE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HOW TO SEND IT POOR FELLOW
THEY COULD HEAR OF NO GIRL TO ASSIST HER
AT THE END HE LOOKED UP AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I AXED I GAVE IT YOU BEFORE
IF THE INSPECTOR CAME AGAIN TO-MORROW AFTER SHE HAD RECEIVED THE LETTER SHE LONGED FOR TO ASSURE HER OF HER BROTHER'S SAFETY SHE WOULD BRAVE SHAME AND STAND IN HER BITTER PENANCE--SHE THE LOFTY MARGARET--ACKNOWLEDGING BEFORE A CROWDED JUSTICE-ROOM IF NEED WERE THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS A DOG AND DONE THIS THING BUT IF HE CAME BEFORE SHE HEARD FROM FREDERICK
A GREAT SLATTERNLY GIRL NOT SO OLD AS BESSY BUT TALLER AND STRONGER WAS BUSY AT THE WASH-TUB KNOCKING ABOUT THE FURNITURE IN A ROUGH CAPABLE WAY BUT ALTOGETHER MAKING SO MUCH NOISE THAT MARGARET SHRUNK OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH POOR BESSY WHO HAD SAT DOWN ON THE FIRST CHAIR AS IF COMPLETELY TIRED OUT WITH HER WALK
BUT I SHOULD THINK HE COULD COME ON THURSDAY
AND THAT WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THIS EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN MILTON--TO HIM SO UNSPEAKABLY PRECIOUS DOWN TO ITS VERY BITTERNESS WHICH WAS WORTH ALL THE REST OF LIFE'S SWEETNESS--WOULD BE REMEMBERED
BUT AS SOON AS SHE REVIEWED HER POSITION SHE FOUND THE STING WAS STILL THERE
THE ROOMS HAD A STRANGE ECHOING SOUND IN THEM,--AND THE LIGHT CAME HARSHLY AND STRONGLY IN THROUGH THE UNCURTAINED WINDOWS,--SEEMING ALREADY UNFAMILIAR AND STRANGE
I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY HERE AND MARGARET CLOSED HER EYES BY WAY OF STOPPING THE CONVERSATION
IF HE SHOULD BE RECOGNISED
BUT IT FADED AWAY INSTANTLY
THERE WAS NO ONE UP-STAIRS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM BUT MRS THORNTON AND FANNY
YOU KNOW DIXON ENJOYS MAKING A MYSTERY OUT OF TRIFLES
DID YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION WITH HIM
BUT FOR ALL THAT YOU MUST NOT EXPECT ME TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON QUITTING IT
IF THEY TURN OUT THEY MAYN'T FIND IT SO EASY TO GO IN AGAIN
AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
IT IS QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGARET
IN THE OTHER THERE WAS A STAND WITH A TALL WHITE CHINA VASE FROM WHICH DROOPED WREATHS OF ENGLISH IVY PALE-GREEN BIRCH AND COPPER-COLOURED BEECH-LEAVES
MR HALE WENT THE NEXT MORNING AS HE PROPOSED
YOU HAVE DONE ME GOOD BESSY I DONE YOU GOOD YES
PRAY SPEAK SIR
NOR THE WHOLE WORLD--SHOULD NEVER HINDER HIM FROM LOVING HER
IT'S O'ER FOR THIS TIME
MRS SHAW'S IDEAS OF PROPRIETY AND HER OWN HELPLESS DEPENDENCE ON OTHERS HAD ALWAYS MADE HER INSIST THAT A FOOTMAN SHOULD ACCOMPANY EDITH AND MARGARET IF THEY WENT BEYOND HARLEY STREET OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
IT WOULD DO YOU NO HARM TO HAVE A BRISK WALK TO MARLBOROUGH STREET AND ASK MRS THORNTON IF SHE CAN SPARE IT CERTAINLY SAID MARGARET
I MIGHT FIND ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING A HOME THROUGH A MARRIAGE
HE BEHAVED IN THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MANNER
BUT SHE TRIED TO RALLY AS SHE SAID
THIS LETTER IS FROM AUNT SHAW PAPA
EITHER COURSE WOULD HAVE DONE WITH HER MISTRESS
I WONDER IF A MARRIAGE MUST ALWAYS BE PRECEDED BY WHAT YOU CALL A WHIRLWIND OR WHETHER IN SOME CASES THERE MIGHT NOT RATHER BE A CALM AND PEACEFUL TIME JUST BEFORE IT CINDERELLA'S GODMOTHER ORDERING THE TROUSSEAU THE WEDDING-BREAKFAST WRITING THE NOTES OF INVITATION FOR INSTANCE SAID MR LENNOX LAUGHING
AT LAST OUT IT CAME
INTENDING TO GO OUT AS SOON AS SHE LEFT HER POSITION BUT UNWILLING TO USE THE VIOLENCE HE HAD THREATENED NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE
BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT ANY MORE IF YOU PLEASE
BUT NE'ER MIND
AND ETERNAL LIFE IS ALL A TALK VERY FIT FOR--I AX YOUR PARDON SIR
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND ASSENTED TO ALL SHE PROPOSED THOUGH MANY OF HER PROPOSITIONS ABSOLUTELY CONTRADICTED ONE ANOTHER
AND MARGARET THOUGHT THAT THE HAPPY LOOK OF INTEREST IN HIS OCCUPATION WAS A GOOD SIGN
AND LET THEM THINK IF THEY LIKED THAT HE HAD RELENTED FROM HIS EXPRESSED DETERMINATION NOT TO REPAPER
SHE REMEMBERED--SHE THEN STRONG IN HER OWN UNTEMPTED TRUTH--ASKING HIM IF HE DID NOT THINK THAT BUYING IN THE CHEAPEST AND SELLING IN THE DEAREST MARKET PROVED SOME WANT OF THE TRANSPARENT JUSTICE WHICH IS SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF TRUTH
YOU NEED NOT SPEAK SO HASTILY
SHE KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT WAS
THOUGH I DID THINK IT MIGHT SHAKE DOWN SOME OF THOSE TALL CHIMNEYS WHERE IS FREDERICK NOW MAMMA
AT ANY RATE MR THORNTON SAID MRS HALE YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MILTON IS A MUCH MORE SMOKY DIRTY TOWN THAN YOU WILL EVER MEET WITH IN THE SOUTH I'M AFRAID I MUST GIVE UP ITS CLEANLINESS SAID MR THORNTON WITH THE QUICK GLEAMING SMILE
FOLK WHO SETS UP TO DOCTOR TH WORLD WI THEIR TRUTH MUN SUIT DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT MINDS
BUT IF HE WOULD DEAR PRAY SAY THAT COSMO AND I WILL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE HIM HAPPY
I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IN THIS WORLD
THESE ARE THE LETTERS HE WROTE ON BOARD THE RUSSELL
MY FATHER IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ALARMED I FEAR
EVERY EVENT WAS MEASURED BY THE EMOTIONS OF THE MIND NOT BY ITS ACTUAL EXISTENCE FOR EXISTENCE IT HAD NONE
NOW THAT WILL BE DONE AWAY WITH HOW ASKED MR THORNTON TOO EARNESTLY CURIOUS TO BE AWARE OF THE IMPERTINENCE OF HIS QUESTION
HE CLOSED HIS EYES IN DEATH
MAIS JE VOUDROIS LE CORRIGER PAR VOYE DE COMPASSION
OF WHICH HOWEVER MRS THORNTON TOOK NO NOTICE
JUST AS MARGARET HAD HER HAND ON THE DOOR OF THEIR SITTING-ROOM SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A QUICK-STEPPING WAITER
IF IT'S ONLY JUST TO SHOW THEY'D NOUGHT TO DO WI A MEASURE WHICH IF WE'D BEEN MADE O TH RIGHT STUFF WOULD HA BROUGHT WAGES UP TO A POINT THEY'N NOT BEEN AT THIS TEN YEAR YOU'LL GET WORK SHAN'T YOU ASKED MARGARET
AND PAPA TOO
THEIR FACES WERE COLD AND RIGID AND WAN FROM LONG WATCHING
BUT IF YOU THINK THE TERM IS NOT CORRECT PAPA I WON'T USE IT
GET THEE GONE!--GET THEE GONE HE CRIED STRIKING WILDLY AND BLINDLY AT HER
AND AT HER TOO WITH HER FINE NOTIONS AND HAUGHTY TOSSES I ONLY WONDER WHY YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT HER THEN SAID FANNY
THEN FEEBLY LEANING ON HER ARMS FOR AN INSTANT TO STEADY HERSELF MARGARET GATHERED HERSELF UP AND ROSE
SARAH DID SARAH WHAT SAID FANNY WITH IMPATIENT CURIOSITY
I'M SORRY NOW THAT I ACTED UPON INFORMATION WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SO ERRONEOUS
DO YOU SPEAK OF HER AS YOU WOULD OF A HORSE OR A DOG MR THORNTON'S EYES GLOWED LIKE RED EMBERS
NO NOISE--NO GATHERING TOGETHER OF CREDITORS--IT WAS DONE VERY SILENTLY AND QUIETLY BUT ALL WAS PAID AT LAST
WHAT SHALL I DO
THAT IS IF YOU DON'T WALK SO FAST
SHE TRIED TO TURN THEIR THOUGHTS IN SOME OTHER DIRECTION
BUT HE LOVED ME AND I LOVED HIM THOUGH I WAS CALLING HIM FIVE MINUTES AGONE
I COULD FIND IN MY HEART TO PUT YOU IN A PASSION ANY DAY JUST TO SEE HIS STORMY LOOK COMING LIKE A GREAT CLOUD OVER YOUR FACE
MARGARET WENT IN
SOME IN THE GREEN SHADOW
THE DOMESTIC WORRIES PRESSED SO VERY CLOSELY AND IN SO NEW AND SORDID A FORM UPON ALL THE WOMEN IN THE FAMILY THAT THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO FEAR THAT HER MOTHER'S HEALTH MIGHT BE BECOMING SERIOUSLY AFFECTED
AND SHE WENT SLOWLY AND MAJESTICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM
BUT I SEE YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY RESOLVED
I KNOW WHAT FANNY IS
LEFT YOU ALONE OH YES
SHE LOST HERSELF IN DISMAL THOUGHT
SOMETIMES WHEN I'VE THOUGHT O MY LIFE AND THE LITTLE PLEASURE I'VE HAD IN IT I'VE BELIEVED THAT MAYBE I WAS ONE OF THOSE DOOMED TO DIE BY THE FALLING OF A STAR FROM HEAVEN
ABOUT FREDERICK TOO THERE WAS GREAT UNEASINESS
AND BESIDE ALL THAT COMMITTEE KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT IN THEIR DEMAND AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE RIGHT ALL MIXED UP WI WRONG TILL FOLK CAN'T SEPARATE IT NO MORE NOR I CAN TH PHYSIC-POWDER FROM TH JELLY YO GAVE ME TO MIX IT IN
THEY HAD LEISURE TO OBSERVE AND TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER IN LOW VOICES BEFORE MRS THORNTON APPEARED
SHE WAS SO GENTLE AND LADYLIKE IN HER MODE OF RECEPTION THAT HER VISITOR WAS SOMEWHAT DAUNTED
AND IT WILL BE A RISK ONLY IT IS WORTH TRYING
BUT THE DANGER TO HIM I'M AFRAID IS VERY GREAT ALL THESE YEARS SINCE THE MUTINY PAPA YES
FRED'S LAST WORDS HAD BEEN TO ENJOIN ME TO KEEP HIS VISIT A SECRET FROM ALL
SHE NEEDED THE RELIEF OF SOLITUDE AFTER A DAY OF BUSY THINKING AND BUSIER REPENTING
MARGARET HEARD A NOISE AT THE DOOR
STATE O TRADE
BUT THE PERSISTENCE OF THEIR MONOTONOUS WORK WAS RIVALLED IN TIRELESS ENDURANCE BY THE STRONG CROWDS WHO WITH SENSE AND WITH PURPOSE WERE BUSY AND RESTLESS IN SEEKING AFTER--WHAT
AN IF SORROW COMES TO THEM THEY LOVE IT HURTS EM AS SORE AS E'ER IT DID SOLOMON
THE LIVING IS EVIDENTLY AS SMALL AS SHE SAID
I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
SHE HELD HER BREATH TO HEAR THE END OF HIS SPEECH
POOR PAPA!'--TRYING TO DIVERT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS INTO COMPASSIONATE SYMPATHY FOR ALL HER FATHER HAD GONE THROUGH
BUT FAR AWAY THE OMINOUS GATHERING ROAR DEEP-CLAMOURING
A SISTER OF MR HORSFALL'S OH DEAR NO
I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
I'M FEARED ON IT AND I NEVER WAS FEARED O DADDY MARGARET'S HEART BLED TO HEAR THAT THE MOTHER IN HER SELFISH REQUIREMENT OF SYMPATHY HAD TAKEN HER CHILDREN UPSTAIRS TO SEE THEIR DISFIGURED FATHER
THEY'RE NOT MINE AND THEY ARE MINE THEY ARE THE CHILDREN YOU SPOKE OF TO ME THIS MORNING WHEN YO SAID REPLIED HIGGINS TURNING ROUND WITH ILL-SMOTHERED FIERCENESS THAT MY STORY MIGHT BE TRUE OR MIGHT NOT BUR IT WERE A VERY UNLIKELY ONE
YOU ARE LATE SAID SHE
BUT I AM SURE THEY OUGHT TO BE TRIED
IS IT SO
BUT I TOOK NO TROUBLE TO CONCEAL MY INDIFFERENCE
TO BE SURE THE MEN WERE CUTTING THEIR OWN THROATS AS THEY HAD DONE MANY A TIME BEFORE
THAT THE MAN HAD SPOKEN SAUCILY TO HIM WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WAS NOTHING TO MR THORNTON
BUT THEN SHE REBELLED AGAINST HERSELF AND PROTESTED SILENTLY AGAINST THE CONFUSION IMPLIED BETWEEN A SPANISH MERCHANT AND A MILTON MILL-OWNER
YOU CAN SAIL FROM LONDON AS WELL AS FROM LIVERPOOL TO BE SURE LITTLE GOOSE
AUNT SHAW HAS I KNOW YES
HE'S NOT AN INFIDEL MARGARET
HE LIKED AND DISLIKED PRETTY NEARLY THE SAME THINGS THAT SHE DID
SHE PREFERRED BEING COMPELLED TO GRATIFY HERSELF BY SOME OTHER PERSON'S COMMAND OR DESIRE
DUNNO YO THINK IT
AT LAST HE STOPPED RIGHT OPPOSITE TO MARGARET AND LOOKED AT HER DROOPING AND DESPONDING ATTITUDE FOR AN INSTANT
YOU BELIEVE ME MISS HALE YES SAID MARGARET QUIETLY AND SADLY
BUT I NAME THIS JUST TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS COMING
YOU KNOW THE PROVERB MR HALE SET A BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK AND HE'LL RIDE TO THE DEVIL,"--WELL SOME OF THESE EARLY MANUFACTURERS DID RIDE TO THE DEVIL IN A MAGNIFICENT STYLE--CRUSHING HUMAN BONE AND FLESH UNDER THEIR HORSES HOOFS WITHOUT REMORSE
SHE PLACED THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND SNUFFED IT CAREFULLY BEFORE SHE TURNED ROUND AND FACED HIM
YO'D GETTEN A MOTHER WHO MIGHT HA KEPT YO'R TONGUE IN CHECK WHEN YO WERE TALKING O WOMEN BEING AT THE ROOT O ALL THE PLAGUES OF COURSE YOU TOLD THAT TO MISS HALE IN COORSE I DID
HER WHITE SILK SLEEVES WERE LOOPED UP WITH STRINGS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AND ON HER NECK JUST BELOW THE BASE OF HER CURVED AND MILK-WHITE THROAT THERE LAY HEAVY CORAL BEADS
I WOULD RATHER HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOU USED TO DO WHEN YOU WERE WELL I THINK I WAS WELL WHEN MOTHER DIED BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN RIGHTLY STRONG SIN SOMEWHERE ABOUT THAT TIME
AND THE SOUND OF HIS WELL-KNOWN AND COMMANDING VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LIKE THE TASTE OF BLOOD TO THE INFURIATED MULTITUDE OUTSIDE
IN FACT WHERE WAS HE TO LOOK FOR COMFORT
ENJOYMENT OF LEISURE--ENJOYMENT OF THE POWER AND INFLUENCE WHICH MONEY GIVES
BUT WAIT A LITTLE
AND MARY EVEN
IS THAT TAPESTRY THING OF IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE
NO NOT HELP ME BUT IF YOU KNEW THE TRUTH PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ME TO RIGHTS--THAT IS NOT IT AFTER ALL SAID SHE IN DESPAIR AT NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS HERSELF MORE EXACTLY AS SHE WISHED
MR HALE WAS NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS VICAR OF HELSTONE BUT AS A MAN WHO ONLY SPENT AT A CERTAIN RATE
HE'S GETTING PAST THE AGE FOR CARING FOR SUCH THINGS EITHER AS PRINCIPAL OR ACCESSORY
YOU WOULD NOT BEAR THE DULNESS OF THE LIFE
WHY YOU COULDN'T DO HALF A DAY'S WORK AT DIGGING AGAINST AN IRISHMAN I'D ONLY CHARGE HALF-A-DAY FOR TH TWELVE HOURS IF I COULD ONLY DO HALF-A-DAY'S WORK IN TH TIME
AND I'LL BE BOUND TO SAY WE HAVE MANY AMONG US WHO IF HE WERE GONE COULD SPRING INTO THE BREACH AND CARRY ON THE WAR WHICH COMPELS AND SHALL COMPEL ALL MATERIAL POWER TO YIELD TO SCIENCE YOUR BOAST REMINDS ME OF THE OLD LINES I'VE A HUNDRED CAPTAINS IN ENGLAND HE SAID AS GOOD AS EVER WAS HE AT HER FATHER'S QUOTATION MARGARET LOOKED SUDDENLY UP WITH INQUIRING WONDER IN HER EYES
WHAT THEN IF I DIE NONSENSE WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER--I OFTEN THINK
WHICH INDEED WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN DETERMINING HOW TO ACT AS THINGS STAND--THE FACTS MUST BE GRANTED BUT SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD HER FATHER MADE A SIGN TO HER TO BE SILENT AND ALLOW MR THORNTON TO FINISH WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
HE NEVER TOLD HER
I STOP HERE SAID HIS MOTHER
THERE ARE FORMS AND CEREMONIES TO BE GONE THROUGH NOT SO MUCH TO SATISFY ONESELF AS TO STOP THE WORLD'S MOUTH WITHOUT WHICH STOPPAGE THERE WOULD BE VERY LITTLE SATISFACTION IN LIFE
AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
OH MARGARET--MARGARET INARTICULATELY AS HE SPOKE KNEELING BY HER AND RATHER MOANING THAN SAYING THE WORDS HE STARTED UP ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AS HIS MOTHER CAME IN
SHE WOULD BE UP TO LOOKING THROUGH EVERY SPEECH THAT A YOUNG MAN MADE HER FOR THE ARRIERE-PENSEE OF A COMPLIMENT
AND NOW NOW--MARGARET--I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY BOY IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SOFA ON A LITTLE STOOL AND SOFTLY TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND CARESSING IT AND KISSING IT AS IF TO COMFORT
ALL BEAUTIFUL SCRIPTURES CAME INTO HER MIND
HE LIVING A LAZY LIFE IN A DROWSY COLLEGE
I KNOW WHO'LL WIN MARGARET FANCIED FROM HIS MANNER THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DRINKING NOT SO MUCH FROM WHAT HE SAID AS FROM THE EXCITED WAY IN WHICH HE SPOKE
WHO IS TO TAKE CARE OF YOU WHEN I AM GONE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHICH OF US IS TAKING CARE OF THE OTHER
HE'S FAILED OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND THAT HENRY TOLD YOU OF THAT DAY YOU HAD SUCH A HEADACHE,--WHAT WAS IT
SHE BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE INSTEAD OF HAVING HER THOUGHTS TURNED SO EXCLUSIVELY INWARD
AND YET MEN SET ME DOWN IN THEIR FOOL'S BOOKS AS A WISE MAN
BUT JARGONELLE PEARS WILL DO AS WELL AS ANYTHING AND THERE ARE QUANTITIES OF THEM IN THE MARKET YOU WILL TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO I'M SURE REPLIED MR THORNTON
WE'LL JUST CLEM THEM TO DEATH FIRST
YET WITHIN A MILE MARGARET KNEW OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE WHERE SHE FOR HER OWN SAKE AND HER MOTHER FOR HER AUNT SHAW'S WOULD BE WELCOMED IF THEY CAME IN GLADNESS OR EVEN IN PEACE OF MIND
CHAPTER XXIII MISTAKES WHICH WHEN HIS MOTHER SAW SHE IN HER MIND WAS TROUBLED SORE NE WIST WELL WHAT TO WEEN SPENSER
THIS I TELL YOU--ONLY YOU BESSY
THEN BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HE TURNED SHARP AGAIN
THE HOOTINGS ROSE AND FILLED THE AIR,--BUT MARGARET DID NOT HEAR THEM
WHAT FOR
BUT THE IDEA OF MR BELL DOMESTICATED IN HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND THE ALARM HE HAD RECEIVED AT THE LAST MOMENT AT THE RAILWAY STATION HAD MADE HIM RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON
MARY YOU SHALL SEE ME THIS AFTERNOON AND FOR FEAR OF HER OWN COWARDICE SHE WENT AWAY IN ORDER TO TAKE FROM HERSELF ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING HER DETERMINATION
AND WITH AN INTUITIVE DESIRE TO EFFACE THE TRACES OF WEAKNESS AND BRING HERSELF INTO ORDER AGAIN SHE SOUGHT FOR IT ALTHOUGH FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE COURSE OF THE SEARCH SHE HAD TO SIT DOWN AND RECOVER STRENGTH
BUT TO-NIGHT SHE WAS AFRAID SHE KNEW NOT WHY
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT CHILD SAID HE
OUR LETTERS ARE DIRECTED TO THE CARE OF MESSRS
I BELIEVE YOU WERE THE MAGISTRATE WHO ATTENDED TO TAKE DOWN THE DEPOSITION OF A POOR MAN WHO DIED IN THE INFIRMARY LAST NIGHT YES REPLIED MR THORNTON
I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE TRUE SAID MRS HALE AT LENGTH
HE IS SO THROWN AWAY
THERE HE LAY
HER IN-DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
I SIMPLY LOOK UPON THEM WITH CONTEMPT FOR THEIR POORNESS OF CHARACTER BUT YOU HAVE HAD THE RUDIMENTS OF A GOOD EDUCATION REMARKED MR HALE
COURAGE SOYONS MESHUY SUR NOS GARDES DIEU NOUS AYDERA THE WAY OF HUMILITY
MARGARET AND MR LENNOX STROLLED ALONG THE LITTLE TERRACE-WALK UNDER THE SOUTH WALL WHERE THE BEES STILL HUMMED AND WORKED BUSILY IN THEIR HIVES
I AM AFRAID I SHAN'T LIKE SUCH HARD WORK ARCHERY PARTIES--PIC-NICS--RACE-BALLS--HUNT-BALLS OH NO SAID SHE LAUGHING
I SHALL HAVE TO LAY MYSELF OPEN TO SUCH A CATECHIST AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I AM PREPARED TO DO IT NO SAID MR HALE
THERE WAS A LITTLE QUIET MAN WHO CAME UP FOR ORDERS ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK BUT THIS WAS NOT A LITTLE MAN--A GREAT POWERFUL FELLOW
I NEVER THOUGHT O TELLING TH POLICE ON HIM
MR HALE WOULD HOPE WOULD NOT DESPAIR BETWEEN THE ATTACKS OF HIS WIFE'S MALADY
SHE CAN'T PLAY GO ON FANNY
YOU WILL NOT GO NO ANSWER
DOWN-STAIRS MARGARET STOOD CALM AND COLLECTED READY TO COUNSEL OR ADVISE THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN TO HELP THE COOK AND CHARLOTTE
IN THE BACK STREETS AROUND THEM THERE WERE MANY MILLS OUT OF WHICH POURED STREAMS OF MEN AND WOMEN TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY
THEY'LL MURDER YOU SHE CLUNG TO HER MOTHER'S GOWN
HE MUST GO TO-MORROW I'M AFRAID PAPA SAID SHE TENDERLY
AND NOW I SHALL DIE FAR AWAY FROM IT
HER EYE WAS ON THE GROUP OF LADS WHO HAD ARMED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR CLOGS SOME TIME BEFORE
NOW I WAS WELL
THE LATTER IN A FLUTTER OF SMALL EXULTATION AS THE MAID HELD UP ONE GLOSSY MATERIAL AFTER ANOTHER TO TRY THE EFFECT OF THE WEDDING-DRESSES BY CANDLELIGHT
AND IF PAPA THINKS FIT HE CAN WRITE AGAIN WHEN HE COMES IN,--IT IS ONLY A DAY'S DELAY
THERE WAS NOT MERELY THE FACT WHICH DISTURBED HER EXCESSIVELY OF FREDERICK'S DETENTION IN LONDON BUT THERE WERE ALLUSIONS TO THE RECOGNITION AT THE LAST MOMENT AT MILTON AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A PURSUIT WHICH MADE HER BLOOD RUN COLD
HE WAS AWAY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR
BUT WOE BEING COME THE SOUL IS DUMB THAT CRIETH NOT ON GOD MRS
HE HATED HIMSELF FOR THE IDEA THAT FORCED ITSELF UPON HIM JUST FOR AN INSTANT--NO MORE--AND YET WHILE IT WAS PRESENT THRILLED HIM WITH ITS OLD POTENCY OF ATTRACTION TOWARDS HER IMAGE
WE WILL GO AND SEE THEM TO-MORROW IF YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO WALK SO FAR OH YES
AS IF SHE COULD NOT FORGET HIM WITH ALL HER ENDEAVOURS
AT ANY RATE I SHOULD HAVE WAITED TO BE INFORMED AGAINST AND FINED AND GIVEN ALL THE TROUBLE IN YIELDING THAT I LEGALLY COULD
SHE LOOKED ROUND AND SAW A SMILE PASS BETWEEN HER FATHER AND THE WOMAN
BUT ONCE BANDED TOGETHER YO'VE NO MORE PITY FOR A MAN THAN A WILD HUNGER-MADDENED WOLF NICHOLAS HAD HIS HAND ON THE LOCK OF THE DOOR--HE STOPPED AND TURNED ROUND ON BOUCHER CLOSE FOLLOWING
BUT FOR MASTER
FOR FREDERICK HAD BROKEN DOWN NOW AND ALL HIS THEORIES WERE OF NO USE TO HIM
IF HE WERE SENT TO EVEN THE SCOTCH UNIVERSITIES HE CAME BACK UNSETTLED FOR COMMERCIAL PURSUITS
THE GORMANS WHO ARE OUR NEAREST NEIGHBOURS TO CALL SOCIETY--AND WE HARDLY EVER SEE THEM HAVE BEEN IN TRADE JUST AS MUCH AS THESE MILTON-NORTHERN PEOPLE YES SAID MRS HALE ALMOST INDIGNANTLY BUT AT ANY RATE THE GORMANS MADE CARRIAGES FOR HALF THE GENTRY OF THE COUNTY AND WERE BROUGHT INTO SOME KIND OF INTERCOURSE WITH THEM
YOU WILL SEE MILTON WITHOUT SMOKE IN A FEW DAYS I IMAGINE MISS HALE BUT WHY ASKED SHE COULD YOU NOT EXPLAIN WHAT GOOD REASON YOU HAVE FOR EXPECTING A BAD TRADE
I COULDN'T STAND THE RESTRAINTS OF SUCH A PROPER-BEHAVED AND CIVIL-SPOKEN SET OF PEOPLE AS THESE ARE
THE INSTABILITY OF ALL HUMAN THINGS IS FAMILIAR TO ME TO YOU IT IS NEW AND OPPRESSIVE LET US GO ON TO SEE LITTLE SUSAN SAID MARGARET DRAWING HER COMPANION UP A GRASSY ROAD-WAY LEADING UNDER THE SHADOW OF A FOREST GLADE
HERE THEY WERE AND HERE THEY MUST REMAIN
SHE USED TO SIT LONG HOURS UPON THE BEACH GAZING INTENTLY ON THE WAVES AS THEY CHAFED WITH PERPETUAL MOTION AGAINST THE PEBBLY SHORE,--OR SHE LOOKED OUT UPON THE MORE DISTANT HEAVE AND SPARKLE AGAINST THE SKY AND HEARD WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF HEARING THE ETERNAL PSALM WHICH WENT UP CONTINUALLY
FOR INDEED SHE LOOKS AS GRAND AND SERENE AS ONE WHO HAS STRUGGLED AND MAY BE STRUGGLING AND YET HAS THE VICTORY SECURE IN SIGHT
DIXON TELLS ME HE SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT HER MARGARET HESITATED
BUT I SHOULD SAY BEAR ON WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE FORCED ME TO GIVE YOU SO ABRUPTLY TILL THE FACT WHICH I COULD NOT WITH-HOLD HAS BECOME IN SOME DEGREE FAMILIAR TO YOU SO THAT YOU MAY WITHOUT TOO GREAT AN EFFORT BE ABLE TO GIVE WHAT COMFORT YOU CAN TO YOUR FATHER
I HA THOUGHT TILL MY BRAINS ACHED,--BELI ME JOHN I HAVE
AND HE CONTRASTED THEM UNEASILY WITH THE LARGE SOFT EYES THAT LOOKED FORTH STEADILY AT ONE OBJECT AS IF FROM OUT THEIR LIGHT BEAMED SOME GENTLE INFLUENCE OF REPOSE
NOW WASN'T IT SO MARGARET I BELIEVE I THOUGHT IT WOULD DO BOTH GOOD TO SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THE OTHER,--I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS MY IDEA ANY MORE THAN PAPA'S AND SO YOU SEE MR THORNTON WE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN IMPROVING EACH OTHER DOWN-STAIRS INSTEAD OF TALKING OVER VANISHED FAMILIES OF SMITHS AND HARRISONS
SHE AND HE HAD A LONG ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION WHILE I WAS AWAY SPEAKING TO THE LANDLORD OH
WHEN SOME BELOVED VOICE THAT WAS TO YOU BOTH SOUND AND SWEETNESS FAILETH SUDDENLY AND SILENCE AGAINST WHICH YOU DARE NOT CRY ACHES ROUND YOU LIKE A STRONG DISEASE AND NEW WHAT HOPE
IT MUST BE DONE BUT SHE LOOKED RATHER RIGID AND PALE AT THE THOUGHT OF IT AND HAD HARD WORK TO FIND THE EXACT WORDS IN WHICH TO EXPLAIN TO HER AUNT WHO MRS THORNTON WAS AND WHY SHE SHOULD GO TO BID HER FAREWELL
WHEN HE HAD SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY LEFT THE ROOM MARGARET ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND BEGAN SILENTLY TO FOLD UP HER WORK
THE MANUFACTURING TOWN IN DARKSHIRE YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
FROM THAT DAY MILTON BECAME A BRIGHTER PLACE TO HER
POOR LITTLE FELLOW HOW WELL HE LOOKED IN HIS MIDSHIPMAN'S DRESS WITH HIS DIRK IN HIS HAND CUTTING OPEN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WITH IT AS IF IT WERE A PAPER-KNIFE
HOW HAS SHE GOT HURT I DON'T KNOW,--I HAVE NO TIME TO ASK
GONE HOME SAID SHE RATHER SHORTLY
BE SURE YOU NOTICE THE DINNER WELL
IT'S THE BUSTLE AND THE STRUGGLE THEY LIKE
GO ON
GO ON
THE WILD ADVENTUROUS FREEDOM OF THEIR LIFE HAD TAKEN HER FANCY
I BUY IN THE PROVISIONS WHOLESALE AND PROVIDE A FITTING MATRON OR COOK I HOPE YOU GIVE SATISFACTION IN YOUR NEW CAPACITY
HE SCOWLED AT THE WATCHERS WHEN HE SAW THEM
ONE HOUSE MUN DO FOR US A AND THE FURNITURE O T'OTHER WOULD GO A GOOD WAY
NOW SHE HAD GOT TO LOVE THE OLD NURSERY THOUGH IT WAS BUT A DISMANTLED PLACE
NO DIXON SAID MARGARET WITH DECISION
HE PROMISED TO COME AGAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING
MARGARET I HEARD YOU WERE UP
WHAT THE MASTER IS THAT WILL THE MEN BE WITHOUT OVER-MUCH TAKING THOUGHT ON HIS PART THAT IS A GREAT ADMISSION SAID MARGARET LAUGHING
AND SHE REALLY WANTED SOME ONE TO HELP HER TO A FEW PLEASANT QUIET IDEAS CONNECTED WITH A MARRIAGE
HE HAS BEEN ON CIRCUIT NOW SINCE I CAME
THOU MUN GO TELL THE WIFE
CHAPTER XL OUT OF TUNE I HAVE NO WRONG WHERE I CAN CLAIM NO RIGHT NAUGHT TA'EN ME FRO WHERE I HAVE NOTHING HAD YET OF MY WOE I CANNOT SO BE QUITE
AND IF THIS HENRY LENNOX IS HALF GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER AND SHE LIKES HIM--WELL
HE CAME PERPETUALLY TO THE DOOR OF HER MOTHER'S CHAMBER PAUSING THERE TO LISTEN TILL SHE NOT HEARING HIS CLOSE UNSEEN PRESENCE WENT AND OPENED IT TO TELL HIM HOW ALL WENT ON IN REPLY TO THE QUESTIONS HIS BAKED LIPS COULD HARDLY FORM
I LIGHTED THE TAPER AND RAN UP TO TELL YOU
A CLOSE STRAW BONNET OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND SHAPE TRIMMED WITH WHITE RIBBON
AND ABOVE ALL POSSIBLE CHANCES AVOID LETTING PAPA HEAR ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE JUST BEEN SAYING
AND THEN HER AUNT WORRIED HER ABOUT OLD CLAIMS AND WAS SHE FORGETFUL OF OLD FRIENDS
MARGARET HAD REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE
BY-AND-BY SHE SAID
I'M ALL WRONG GROWLED MR BELL
COVER ME UP AND I'LL MAY BE SLEEP IF TH COUGH WILL LET ME
SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO SEARCH FOR THE TURKEY-RED MARKING-THREAD TO PUT IN THE NEW INITIALS
LET ME MAKE A FACE WHILE I SWALLOW IT
A LITTLE REST WILL PUT HER QUITE TO RIGHTS--EH MARGARET I HOPE SO SAID MARGARET,--BUT SO SADLY THAT HER FATHER TOOK NOTICE OF IT
I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY BUT I SEE WE ARE NOTHING TO EACH OTHER
STILL IT WAS UNSATISFACTORY TO SEE HOW COMPLETELY HER THOUGHTS WERE TURNED UPON HERSELF AND HER OWN POSITION AND THIS SELFISHNESS EXTENDED EVEN TO HER RELATIONS WITH HER CHILDREN WHOM SHE CONSIDERED AS INCUMBRANCES EVEN IN THE VERY MIDST OF HER SOMEWHAT ANIMAL AFFECTION FOR THEM
SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD A MOAN
I'M SURE I'M TIRED ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECT WELL SAID HER BROTHER WITH A SHADE OF BITTERNESS
BUT SHE DID NOT EVEN OPEN HER EYES FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
FANNY'S HUSBAND WAS VEXED AT THORNTON'S REFUSAL TO TAKE ANY SHARE IN THE SPECULATION WHICH HE HAD OFFERED TO HIM AND WITHDREW FROM ANY POSSIBILITY OF BEING SUPPOSED ABLE TO ASSIST HIM WITH THE READY MONEY WHICH INDEED THE SPECULATOR NEEDED FOR HIS OWN VENTURE
HE INQUIRED AFTER MRS HALE AND HEARD MR HALE'S SANGUINE HOPEFUL ACCOUNT
BUT THE LATE DISCOVERIES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE HAVE GIVEN US LARGE POWER OF ALLEVIATION MY FATHER SAID MARGARET TREMBLING ALL OVER
SEEING THE OLD SOUTH COUNTRY-TOWNS AND HAMLETS SLEEPING IN THE WARM LIGHT OF THE PURE SUN WHICH GAVE A YET RUDDIER COLOUR TO THEIR TILED ROOFS SO DIFFERENT TO THE COLD SLATES OF THE NORTH
I WILL WRITE TO-DAY SAID SHE
MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED-TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
ARCHITECT OF HIS OWN FORTUNES HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO NO SPECIAL MERIT OR QUALITIES OF HIS OWN BUT TO THE POWER WHICH HE BELIEVED THAT COMMERCE GAVE TO EVERY BRAVE HONEST AND PERSEVERING MAN TO RAISE HIMSELF TO A LEVEL FROM WHICH HE MIGHT SEE AND READ THE GREAT GAME OF WORLDLY SUCCESS AND HONESTLY BY SUCH FAR-SIGHTEDNESS COMMAND MORE POWER AND INFLUENCE THAN IN ANY OTHER MODE OF LIFE
THERE WAS ALTOGETHER A TONE OF FORCED CHEERFULNESS IN THE LETTER AS MARGARET NOTICED AFTERWARDS
THINK O HER LYING THEERE AFTER THE LIFE HOO'S LED AND THINK THEN HOW YO'D DENY ME THE ONE SOLE COMFORT LEFT--THAT THERE IS A GOD AND THAT HE SET HER HER LIFE
WHERE SHALL YOU LIVE WITH MY AUNT REPLIED MARGARET TURNING TOWARDS MRS SHAW
SHE CRAVES FOR FRUIT,--SHE HAS A CONSTANT FEVER ON HER
MR THORNTON CAME OCCASIONALLY BUT HIS VISITS WERE ADDRESSED TO HER FATHER AND WERE CONFINED TO THE STUDY
AT NIGHT WHEN MARGARET REALISED THIS SHE FELT INCLINED TO SIT DOWN IN A STUPOR OF DESPAIR
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I AM BRAVE OR NOT TILL I AM TRIED
I ONLY KNOW IT HAS A VERY VULGAR SOUND AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU USING IT VERY WELL DEAREST MOTHER I WON'T
I DO NOT CHOOSE TO THINK TOO CLOSELY ON WHAT I AM MYSELF
I'VE ASKED MR THORNTON TO COME TO TEA TO-NIGHT MRS HALE WAS LEANING BACK IN HER EASY CHAIR WITH HER EYES SHUT AND AN EXPRESSION OF PAIN ON HER FACE WHICH HAD BECOME HABITUAL TO HER OF LATE
BEFORE THE NIGHT OF THAT DAY DR DONALDSON'S OPINION WAS PROVED TO BE TOO WELL FOUNDED
AND I'LL BE TRUE TO MINE
I SHALL NOT BE AT HOME TILL EVENING
OUT OF THE WISDOM OF THE PAST HELP US OVER THE PRESENT
THEN OUT OF IT
IT'S A HARD WORLD TO LIVE IN SO IT IS MY CHILD
SO SHE SAT ALMOST MOTIONLESS FOR HOURS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM GOING OVER THE BITTERNESS OF EVERY REMEMBRANCE WITH AN UNWINCING RESOLUTION
AND YOU'RE WELL OFF NEVER TO HAVE LOST ANY FRIEND TILL NOW PERHAPS SO
JUST BEFORE MARGARET HAD RECOVERED FROM HER NECESSITY FOR QUIET AND REPOSE--BEFORE SHE HAD BEGUN TO FEEL HER LIFE WANTING AND DULL--EDITH CAME DOWN-STAIRS AND RESUMED HER USUAL PART IN THE HOUSEHOLD
HER FATHER MEANWHILE WITH HIS KINDLY COUNTRY HOSPITALITY WAS PRESSING MR THORNTON TO STAY TO LUNCHEON WITH THEM
SUPPOSE THORNTONS SENT EM THEIR DINNER OUT,--TH SAME MONEY SPENT ON POTATOES AND MEAL WOULD KEEP MANY A CRYING BABBY QUIET AND HUSH UP ITS MOTHER'S HEART FOR A BIT DON'T SPEAK SO SAID MARGARET
SHE MAY NOT CARE FOR IT
MASTER FREDERICK HAD BEEN HER FAVORITE AND PRIDE
BUT LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW A MINUTE AFTER HE WAS STRUCK WITH THE LEAN BENT FIGURE GOING OUT OF THE YARD
I WAS THINKING THAT IF WE WANTED ANY HELP IN THE HOUSE WHILE HE IS HERE WE COULD PERHAPS GET MARY HIGGINS
MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MRS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE
YO SEE IF YO'D SPOKEN O RELIGION AS A THING THAT IF IT WAS TRUE IT DIDN'T CONCERN ALL MEN TO PRESS ON ALL MEN'S ATTENTION ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS VARSAL EARTH I SHOULD HA THOUGHT YO A KNAVE FOR TO BE A PARSON
SHE HAD HARDLY GIVEN WAY TO THE FIRST CHOKING SOB WHEN SHE BECAME AWARE OF DIXON STANDING AT HER DRAWERS AND EVIDENTLY SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING
AND I MUST E'EN GO ON IN THEIR WAYS THOUGH MRS HEPWORTH DOES WANT TO GIVE ME COMFITS INSTEAD OF MEDICINE WHICH AS SHE SAYS IS A DEAL PLEASANTER ONLY I'VE NO FAITH IN IT
OR RATHER DON'T YOU TOSS ABOUT AND TRY IN VAIN TO FIND AN EASY POSITION AND WAKEN IN THE MORNING AS TIRED AS WHEN YOU WENT TO BED MARGARET LAUGHED
HE WAS A LITTLE ABASHED BY HER REGAL COMPOSURE
YOU'VE A PRETTY GOOD TEMPER OF YOUR OWN
I DON'T ASK WHO YOU HAVE HEARD ABUSING THE MEN
NO I SEE YOU DO NOT
I'M AFRAID WE'VE DONE TOO MUCH SAID MR BELL
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH THE SAME QUIET OBSTINACY AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
AND CAPTAIN LENNOX AND WHAT HE HAD TOLD EDITH ABOUT HER FUTURE LIFE AT CORFU WHERE HIS REGIMENT WAS STATIONED
IT IS LIKE THE CIRCLE IN WHICH THE VICTIMS OF EARTHLY PASSION EDDY CONTINUALLY
TRUE SHE WAS SADLY PREJUDICED AND VERY IGNORANT
AT CADIZ OR SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
SHE PUT HER HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS
OH HELP ME
I ALWAYS DISLIKE THAT DOING THINGS IN SUCH A HURRY SAID MRS HALE
HE SHALL INQUIRE HOW SHE IS I MUST GO MYSELF NOT MERELY TO ASK HOW MISS HALE IS NO NOT MERELY FOR THAT
IT WAS STERN AND UNMOVED;--NAY BUT THAT THE EYES OF THE SICK WOMAN WERE GROWING DIM WITH THE SLOW-GATHERING TEARS SHE MIGHT HAVE SEEN A DARK CLOUD CROSS THE COLD FEATURES
BUT THAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED FROM HER SOUTHERN BREEDING
SO HE STOOD STILL AGAIN VOUCHSAFING NO ANSWER BUT A SHORT NOD OF RECOGNITION TO THE FEW MEN WHO KNEW AND SPOKE TO HIM AS THE CROWD DROVE OUT OF THE MILLYARD AT DINNER-TIME AND SCOWLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AT THE IRISH KNOBSTICKS WHO HAD JUST BEEN IMPORTED
HAVE FAITH IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL WHICH NO PAIN NO MORTAL DISEASE CAN ASSAIL OR TOUCH BUT ALL THE REPLY HE GOT WAS IN THE CHOKED WORDS YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN MARRIED DR DONALDSON
THE LANDLORD RECEIVED THEIR THANKS VERY COMPOSEDLY
HE EVIDENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ASKED TO SPEND THE DAY AND ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH A GLAD READINESS THAT MADE MRS HALE WISH SHE COULD ADD SOMETHING TO THE COLD BEEF
I MUST GO HOME NOT UNTIL I HAVE APPLIED SOME STRIPS OF PLASTER
BUT SHE CHOKED IN THE EFFORT AND COULD ONLY TOUCH HER DEEP MOURNING AND SAY THE ONE WORD PAPA SURELY SIR IT'S NEVER SO SAID MRS PURKIS TURNING TO MR BELL FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE SAD SUSPICION THAT NOW ENTERED HER MIND
MRS HALE HER EYES STILL FIXED ON MRS THORNTON'S FACE PRESSED THE HAND THAT LAY BELOW HERS ON THE COVERLET
NEITHER MY WIFE NOR BESS COULD E'ER SAY THAT MUCH AGAIN ME ALL THE MORE DO I THANK YOU SAID MARGARET SMILING
SHE COULD HARDLY SPEAK WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AT LAST AND TOLD HER MOTHER THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER PEGGY THE LAUNDRY-MAID BUT MARGARET HALE THE LADY
THE CONDUCTOR THOUGHT HE WAS WISHING FOR A PLACE AND STOPPED NEAR THE PAVEMENT
SHE HAS HAD SPASMS AS I ANTICIPATED THOUGH I DID NOT TELL MISS HALE OF MY APPREHENSIONS
WELL I CAN'T BURN MINE BECAUSE IT WOULD HURT ME AND THE SCAR WOULD BE UGLY
TO CONVINCE HIMSELF OF HIS POWER OF SELF-CONTROL HE LINGERED OVER EVERY PIECE OF BUSINESS THIS AFTERNOON
HOW DID MISS HALE GO HOME
THEY RECKONED ON THEIR FELLOW-MEN AS IF THEY POSSESSED THE CALCULABLE POWERS OF MACHINES NO MORE NO LESS
I KEEP FALLING ASLEEP AND DREAMING THAT HE IS CAUGHT AND BEING TRIED OH MAMMA DON'T BE AFRAID
NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
MARGARET WAS WORKING ON A LOW STOOL BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REFINED AND SIMPLE HOSPITALITY HE SHOWED TO ME THAT LAST DAY AT HELSTONE ONLY HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET ANXIOUS IN ORDER TO LULL CERTAIN QUALMS OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE TO BELIEVE THAT MR HALE'S CONDUCT HAD A TINGE OF QUIXOTISM IN IT MR BELL GROWLED OUT--'AYE
I WILL NOT HAVE THEIR TIME TAKEN UP WITH OUR ERRANDS
SHE SAW HIM ALIGHT
THE BITTERNESS OF HIS HEART COULD HAVE UTTERED ONE BUT HIS MOTHER DESERVED BETTER OF HIM
I WAS KEPT BY THOSE WOMEN IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
IT SOBERED HIM BACK INTO GRAVE RESOLUTION THAT HENCEFORTH HE WOULD SEE AS LITTLE OF HER AS POSSIBLE,--SINCE THE VERY SIGHT OF THAT FACE AND FORM THE VERY SOUNDS OF THAT VOICE LIKE THE SOFT WINDS OF PURE MELODY HAD SUCH POWER TO MOVE HIM FROM HIS BALANCE
MISS HALE ACTED UNDER MY DIRECTIONS
ANOTHER WHO HAD GONE THAT DEADLY COLOUR COULD NEVER HAVE COME ROUND WITHOUT EITHER FAINTING OR HYSTERICS
YOU WILL WRITE DIRECTLY WON'T YOU
AND EVENTS HAD OCCURRED TO CHANGE HIM MUCH IN THAT TIME
AS THEY DROVE THROUGH THE LARGER AND WIDER STREETS FROM THE STATION TO THE HOTEL THEY HAD TO STOP CONSTANTLY
I WON'T STAY TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IN LONDON AWAY FROM YOU ON THE ONE HAND AND FROM SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE OTHER IT WAS RATHER A COMFORT TO MARGARET THAT FREDERICK TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER AS SHE WROTE TO MR LENNOX
I COULD SEE YOU WERE ON OUR SIDE IN OUR DISCUSSION AT DINNER,--WERE YOU NOT MISS HALE CERTAINLY
THEN I'VE A GREEN SILK
ROASTED IT EXPLAINED THE WOMAN
I TOOK THE PAPER IN MY HANDS AS SOON AS I HAD READ IT--I TORE IT UP TO LITTLE BITS--I TORE IT--OH
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO GO
CARING FOR NOTHING BUT FOOD AND REST
SHE CLENCHED HER HANDS TIGHT AND HELD HER BREATH
WE HARDLY HEAR IT EXCEPT IN SUMMER WEATHER WHEN ALL THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN
HE COULD BEST HAVE ILLUSTRATED WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY BY TELLING THEM SOMETHING OF HIS OWN LIFE
BUT YO'LL HAVE A LOT OF PRIZE MILL-OWNERS AT THORNTON'S
SHE TOOK HIS ARM AND WALKED HOME PENSIVELY AND WEARILY BY HIS SIDE
WE HAVE HAD OUR SORROW TOO SINCE WE SAW YOU SAID MR HALE
I'M SURE FREDERICK HIMSELF WOULD RUN THE RISK SO HE WOULD
HE WAS REGARDED BY THEM AS A MAN OF GREAT FORCE OF CHARACTER
YOU SEEM TO FANCY THAT MY CONDUCT OF YESTERDAY'--AGAIN THE DEEP CARNATION BLUSH BUT THIS TIME WITH EYES KINDLING WITH INDIGNATION RATHER THAN SHAME--'WAS A PERSONAL ACT BETWEEN YOU AND ME
A THUNDEROUS ATMOSPHERE MORALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY AROUND HER
NOT SO MARGARET THOUGH SHE SAW HIGGINS'S FEELING AS CLEARLY AS HE DID
SHE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND THREW IT OPEN TO DISPEL THE OPPRESSION WHICH HUNG AROUND HER
IN THE FIRST PLACE MARGARET FELT GUILTY AND ASHAMED OF HAVING GROWN SO MUCH INTO A WOMAN AS TO BE THOUGHT OF IN MARRIAGE
FIFTY-FIVE
I AM GOING TO LEAVE HELSTONE LEAVE HELSTONE PAPA
I AM VERY IGNORANT
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY WELCOME FOR THEY'RE GREAT PLAGUES
EITHER TO TEA OR SOON AFTER
HE HAD SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND BEEN TO LOOK AT IT IN COMPLIANCE WITH A REQUEST OF MR BELL'S THAT HE WOULD ASSIST MR HALE TO THE BEST OF HIS POWER
SOME NEIGHBOUR RAN TO THE ROOM WHERE MARY WAS WORKING
SO IF HE WILL DO ME THE HONOUR TO BREAKFAST WITH ME TO-MORROW WE WILL GO OVER THE NAMES OF THESE MISSING GENTRY I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR ALL THE PARTICULARS IF I MAY
MARGARET HAD NEVER SPOKEN OF HELSTONE SINCE SHE LEFT IT EXCEPT JUST NAMING THE PLACE INCIDENTALLY
AT LAST SHE SLEPT
CHAPTER XXXV EXPIATION THERE'S NOUGHT SO FINELY SPUN BUT IT COMETH TO THE SUN MR THORNTON SATE ON AND ON
HE CAME IN NOT FIVE MINUTES AGO WITH SOME LONG STORY OR OTHER ABOUT A FALL HE'D HAD SWEARING AWFULLY
A FORTNIGHT WAS A VERY SHORT TIME TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR SO SERIOUS A REMOVAL
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YO SEE HE'S A COMMITTEE-MAN ON THIS SPECIAL STRIKE TH UNION APPOINTED HIM BECAUSE THOUGH I SAY IT AS SHOULDN'T SAY IT HE'S RECKONED A DEEP CHAP AND TRUE TO TH BACK-BONE
I CAN UNDERSTAND IT ALL SAID MARGARET LEANING UP CARESSINGLY AGAINST HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND KISSING HER HAND
SHE WAS TOO MUCH EXHAUSTED TO THINK
HER FACE MOVED SLOWLY FROM ONE DECIDED EXPRESSION TO ANOTHER EQUALLY DECIDED
AND I SHALL HEAR HOW MAMMA IS MRS HALE WAS AWAKE
I THINK SHE WILL LIKE THAT
WE WILL HARDLY SUBMIT TO THE DECISION OF AN UMPIRE MUCH LESS TO THE INTERFERENCE OF A MEDDLER WITH ONLY A SMATTERING OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE EVEN THOUGH THAT MEDDLER BE CALLED THE HIGH COURT OF PARLIAMENT
BUT SHE DID NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT
BY NO MEANS
HE AND HIS WIFE ARE STIRRING PEOPLE AND HAVE DONE A DEAL OF GOOD
BUT IN AN HOUR SHE WAS TAKEN WORSE
I WONDER IF I COULD MANAGE FIGURES
WHILE SHE SOUGHT FOR THIS PAPER HER VERY HEART-PULSE WAS ARRESTED BY THE TONE IN WHICH MR THORNTON SPOKE
I NEVER SAW A FELLOW SO SPOILED BY SUCCESS
NEITHER HOPE NOR FEAR COULD BE READ THERE
TOO YOUNG TO EARN MONEY BUT OF COURSE SHE HAD TO BE KEPT
IN THE NEXT PLACE ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A COURT-MARTIAL IS AND CONSIDER IT AS AN ASSEMBLY WHERE JUSTICE IS ADMINISTERED INSTEAD OF WHAT IT REALLY IS--A COURT WHERE AUTHORITY WEIGHS NINE-TENTHS IN THE BALANCE AND EVIDENCE FORMS ONLY THE OTHER TENTH
IT HAS COME UPON ME LITTLE BY LITTLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT BEGAN
BE CHEERY AND BRAVE
NOT THE OCTOBER MORNING OF THE COUNTRY WITH SOFT SILVERY MISTS CLEARING OFF BEFORE THE SUNBEAMS THAT BRING OUT ALL THE GORGEOUS BEAUTY OF COLOURING BUT THE OCTOBER MORNING OF MILTON WHOSE SILVER MISTS WERE HEAVY FOGS AND WHERE THE SUN COULD ONLY SHOW LONG DUSKY STREETS WHEN HE DID BREAK THROUGH AND SHINE
SHE SHALL NEVER SCORN ME OUT OF DOING WHAT I PLEASE
THANK YOU
BUT SHE BEGAN SPEAKING HURRIEDLY OF OTHER THINGS UNAWARE THAT MR THORNTON WAS FOLLOWING HIM
HER HOUSE WITH ITS TRELLISED BALCONY AND ITS VIEWS OVER WHITE CLIFFS AND DEEP BLUE SEA
NOT HE
NOT HE
YOU WERE UP LATE LAST NIGHT AND SO YOU'RE LATE THIS MORNING
YOU MAY HAVE WORN SISTER ROSES VERY PROBABLY SHE LOOKED AT THEM WONDERING FOR A MINUTE THEN SHE SMILED A LITTLE AS SHE SAID THEY ARE FROM HELSTONE ARE THEY NOT
HE COULD NOT BEAR THE NOISE THE GARISH LIGHT THE CONTINUED RUMBLE AND MOVEMENT OF THE STREET
EDITH ALL CAP SHAWLS AND TEARS CAME OUT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS AS CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS TAKING HER MOTHER DOWN TO THE CARRIAGE
THEY WERE CLOSE TO A GARDEN-BENCH
FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING THOU ART GOD THAT SKY ABOVE ME LOOKS AS THOUGH IT COULD NOT CHANGE AND YET IT WILL
IT'S NICHOLAS HIGGINS
IT WAS HER BROTHER SAID MR THORNTON TO HIMSELF
TH YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN--MASTER FREDERICK THEY CA'AD HIM--HER BROTHER AS WAS OVER HERE YO KNOWN OVER HERE AY TO BE SURE AT TH MISSUS'S DEATH
SHE HAS LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID SHE LOOKS VERY SERIOUSLY HURT,--I COULD ALMOST FANCY HER DEAD SAID MRS THORNTON A GOOD DEAL ALARMED
I TOLD DIXON TO ASK HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU--I THINK I ASKED HER TO FIND YOU AND YOU WOULD GO TO HIM
NOW HE WAS AT THE HAT-STAND--NOW AT THE VERY ROOM-DOOR
YOU NEED NOT JOIN IN IT UNLESS YOU CHOOSE STILL SOME MORE FEARS WERE URGED
I TELL THEE THOU'D BEEN GLAD ENOUGH WHEN TH DOCTOR SAID HE FEARED THOU'D NEVER SEE ANOTHER WINTER WHY BESSY WHAT KIND OF A LIFE HAS YOURS BEEN NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
HER LIPS WERE STIFF AND DRY
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
FIRST OF A HE MUST GO RAGING LIKE A MAD FOOL AND KICK UP YON RIOT
I WOULD DRESS FOR NONE OF THEM--A SAUCY SET
MRS SHAW AND EDITH COULD HARDLY MAKE ENOUGH OF MARGARET ON HER RETURN TO WHAT THEY PERSISTED IN CALLING HER HOME
I WISH YOU'D LEAVE MILTON
WHETHER IT WAS THAT HER SYMPATHY WOULD BE SO KEEN AND SHOW ITSELF IN SO LIVELY A MANNER THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE REACTION UPON HIMSELF OR WHETHER IT WAS THAT TO HIS SPECULATIVE MIND ALL KINDS OF DOUBTS PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT SUCH A TIME PLEADING AND CRYING ALOUD TO BE RESOLVED INTO CERTAINTIES AND THAT HE KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE SHRUNK FROM THE EXPRESSION OF ANY SUCH DOUBTS--NAY FROM HIM HIMSELF AS CAPABLE OF CONCEIVING THEM--WHATEVER WAS THE REASON HE COULD UNBURDEN HIMSELF BETTER TO MR THORNTON THAN TO HER OF ALL THE THOUGHTS AND FANCIES AND FEARS THAT HAD BEEN FROST-BOUND IN HIS BRAIN TILL NOW
BUT MARGARET WAS INDIFFERENT TO ALL THESE THINGS
BUT EVEN ANY FALL IN FREDERICK'S OPINION WAS AS NOTHING TO THE SHAME THE SHRINKING SHAME SHE FELT AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING MR THORNTON AGAIN
BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY
AND THIS BOUCHER-MAN WAS A TURN-OUT WAS HE NOT THE QUESTION WAS REFERRED TO MR HALE BY HIS WIFE WHEN HE CAME UP-STAIRS FRESH FROM GIVING A LESSON TO MR THORNTON WHICH HAD ENDED IN CONVERSATION AS WAS THEIR WONT
THEN HE'D TO GO INTO HIDING WHERE HE'D A BEEN YET IF THORNTON HAD FOLLOWED HIM OUT AS I'D HOPED HE WOULD HA DONE
I NEVER LIKED HIM
BUT IT FORCED HER TO SIT DOWN
HENRY AND SHE GREW SLOWLY INTO CLOSER INTIMACY
HER EYES BEGAN TO SEE NOT VISIONS OF WHAT HAD BEEN BUT THE SIGHT ACTUALLY BEFORE HER
NOW I'VE GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF NEWS FOR YOU
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE STOOD IN HIS OPINION
HE KNEW HOW SHE WOULD LOVE
AND WE HOPED THAT THE NAME OF CARR WHICH WAS IN THE LIST WAS A MISPRINT FOR THAT OF HALE--NEWSPAPERS ARE SO CARELESS
AH SAID MRS HEPWORTH YOU MUST EXCUSE THIS UNTIDINESS MISS HALE
IT WAS SO UNUSUAL FOR THE FLUENT LAWYER TO HESITATE THAT MARGARET LOOKED UP AT HIM IN A LITTLE STATE OF QUESTIONING WONDER
AS YEAR BY YEAR THE LABOURER TILLS HIS WONTED GLEBE OR LOPS THE GLADES
THAT WEARY DESERTS WE MAY TREAD A DREARY LABYRINTH MAY THREAD THRO DARK WAYS UNDERGROUND BE LED
WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO SAID SHE AT LAST STRUCK WITH A FRESH WONDER AS TO THEIR FUTURE PLANS IF PLANS INDEED HER FATHER HAD
BUT WHEN THEY HAD COME TO TALK IT OVER MR LENNOX HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CHANCE OF HIS ACQUITTAL IF HE COULD BUT PROVE HIS STATEMENTS BY CREDIBLE WITNESSES--THAT IN SUCH CASE IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO STAND HIS TRIAL OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A GREAT RISK
SHE WAITED HIM THERE
ANSWERED NOTES REMINDED HER OF ENGAGEMENTS TENDED HER WHEN NO GAIETY WAS IN PROSPECT AND SHE WAS CONSEQUENTLY RATHER INCLINED TO FANCY HERSELF ILL
BUT HER HEART WAS OPENED TO THIS GIRL
THAT OTHER MAN'S
MR HENRY LENNOX WAS EXCESSIVELY STRUCK BY THE CHANGE
BUT OTHERWISE I'LL BRING YOU BACK TO MRS SHAW BY LUNCH-TIME ON FRIDAY
I KNOW NOUGHT OF YOUR WAYS DOWN SOUTH
DINING WITH THE OLD HARLEY STREET SET OR WITH GAYER YOUNG FRIENDS OF HIS OWN
AT LAST HER SYMPATHY AND DIXON'S SCOLDING FORCED OUT A FEW FACTS
IF MR THORNTON WOULD BUT SAY SOMETHING TO THEM--LET THEM HEAR HIS VOICE ONLY--IT SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS WILD BEATING AND RAGING AGAINST THE STONY SILENCE THAT VOUCHSAFED THEM NO WORD EVEN OF ANGER OR REPROACH
AT FIRST SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT GASP FOR BREATH
BUT MR HALE SAW NOTHING
SHE WONDERED THAT WITH ALL THIS DWELLING ON THE MANUFACTURES AND TRADE OF THE PLACE NO ALLUSION WAS MADE TO THE STRIKE THEN PENDING
AND YET WITH A SHIFTING OF THE SCENE SHE WAS ONCE MORE IN THE HARLEY STREET DRAWING-ROOM TALKING TO HIM AS OF OLD AND STILL WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS ALL THE TIME THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM KILLED BY THAT TERRIBLE FALL
SHE WAS READY TO LOOK UP BRIGHTLY WHEN HER FATHER CAME DOWN STAIRS
HE HAD NOT MEANT TO GREET HER OTHERWISE THAN WITH HIS LATE STUDIED COLDNESS OF DEMEANOUR
OH DID MR BELL SEE IT A LITTLE
MARGARET'S FACE WAS TOO SAD TO LIGHTEN UP INTO A SMILE AT ALL THIS PREPARATION FOR PAYING TWO VISITS THAT SHE HAD OFTEN MADE BY HERSELF AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY
DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
CHAPTER XXXI SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT SHOW NOT THAT MANNER AND THESE FEATURES ALL THE SERPENT'S CUNNING AND THE SINNER'S FALL CRABBE
AND I MAY ADD THAT ANY EXPRESSION OF IT WILL BE PAINFUL TO ME BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL THAT I DESERVE IT
BUT FROM THE LITTLE I KNOW I SHOULD SAY THAT THE MASSES WERE ALREADY PASSING RAPIDLY INTO THE TROUBLESOME STAGE WHICH INTERVENES BETWEEN CHILDHOOD AND MANHOOD IN THE LIFE OF THE MULTITUDE AS WELL AS THAT OF THE INDIVIDUAL
AND WAS LEAVING THE ROOM LANGUIDLY TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH DIXON WHEN MR HALE MOTIONED HER BACK TO HIS SIDE
OCCASIONALLY AS SHE WAS TURNED ROUND SHE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HERSELF IN THE MIRROR OVER THE CHIMNEY-PIECE AND SMILED AT HER OWN APPEARANCE THERE--THE FAMILIAR FEATURES IN THE USUAL GARB OF A PRINCESS
THE IDEA OF STATELY SIMPLICITY ACCORDS WELL WITH YOUR CHARACTER MARGARET DID NOT QUITE LIKE THIS SPEECH
IT WAS PUTTING YOUR HEAD INTO THE LION'S MOUTH HE GLANCED SHARPLY AT HER
HE SULLENLY ROSE UP
I NEVER DOUBTED YOU HAD BEEN TOLD
YOU SHALL NOT
AND HIS MILLS ARE SOMEWHERE OUT BEYOND HAYLEIGH
I DON'T QUITE THINK IT IS A THING TO BE TALKED ABOUT UNLESS YOU KNEW IT WELL THEN'--PAUSING FOR A MOMENT--'TELL ME WHAT YOU DO THERE
IF SO HE HAD STRIVEN TO SAVE THE SON WHO CAME IN DEFIANCE OF THE LAW TO ATTEND HIS MOTHER'S DEATH-BED
MARGARET TRIED TO RISE AND DREW HER RUFFLED LUXURIANT HAIR INSTINCTLY OVER THE CUT
EVEN WHILE SHE LOOKED SHE SAW LADS IN THE BACK-GROUND STOOPING TO TAKE OFF THEIR HEAVY WOODEN CLOGS--THE READIEST MISSILE THEY COULD FIND
IF MRS THORNTON HAD SPOKEN TO HER ABOUT THE LIE SHE HAD TOLD WELL AND GOOD--SHE WOULD HAVE OWNED IT AND HUMILIATED HERSELF
AND WHEN YOU FIRE UP YOU'RE THE VERY IMAGE OF MASTER FREDERICK
WE SHALL HAVE TEA UP DIRECTLY AND THEN YOU'LL TAKE A CUP WITH US MR HIGGINS
BE A MAN SIR--A CHRISTIAN
ONLY SHE HAD NO IDEA IT WAS SO MUCH
HE SEEMED VERY ANXIOUS TO-NIGHT I SHOULD WONDER IF HE WERE NOT
MARGARET HAD ALWAYS DREADED LEST HER COURAGE SHOULD FAIL HER IN ANY EMERGENCY AND SHE SHOULD BE PROVED TO BE WHAT SHE DREADED LEST SHE WAS--A COWARD
MILTON-NORTHERN
THEY WERE SHORT AND COMPLAINING WITH EVERY NOW AND THEN A LITTLE TOUCH OF BITTERNESS THAT WAS UNUSUAL
MR HALE MET WITH SEVERAL PUPILS RECOMMENDED TO HIM BY MR BELL OR BY THE MORE IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE OF MR THORNTON
I COULD LEAVE IT WITH HIM TO FERRET THEM OUT
LET US GO ALONE--YOU AND ME PAPA
LET US NEVER NAME THE SUBJECT AGAIN
SHE GOT SO MUCH ABSORBED IN WATCHING WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE THAT SHE HARDLY HEARD HER FATHER WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER AND HE HAD TO REPEAT WHAT HE SAID
I COULD BE VERY HAPPY IN SUCH A LIFE
MARGARET WENT LANGUIDLY ABOUT ASSISTING DIXON IN HER TASK OF ARRANGING THE HOUSE
BUT IT IS OF NO USE--NO USE--I CANNOT HELP FEELING IT ACUTELY BUT PAPA HAVE YOU WELL CONSIDERED
AND CALLED HIM INVARIABLY MR HIGGINS INSTEAD OF THE CURT NICHOLAS OR HIGGINS TO WHICH THE DRUNKEN INFIDEL WEAVER HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED
HER EYES WITH THEIR SOFT GLOOM MEETING HIS WITH QUIET MAIDEN FREEDOM
I KNOW IT IS GOD'S WILL
HE TOOK A MIND TO YE YO SEE AND HE THOUGHT A DEAL O YOUR COMING TO SEE US
PRAY FOR ME MARGARET THAT I MAY HAVE FAITH TO PRAY
AND HOW PROUDLY AND IMPERTINENTLY I SPOKE TO HIM THAT DAY
HER COMB HAD FALLEN OUT OF HER HAIR
TO SHOW MY PENITENCE WILL YOU ACCEPT A TEN POUND NOTE TOWARDS YOUR MARKETING AND GIVE THE POOR FELLOWS A FEAST THANK YOU
AND ON SUDDENLY LOOKING UP FROM HER WORK HER EYE WAS CAUGHT BY THE DIFFERENCE OF OUTWARD APPEARANCE BETWEEN HER FATHER AND MR THORNTON AS BETOKENING SUCH DISTINCTLY OPPOSITE NATURES
BUT FRED TRUE TO HIS THEORY DID SOMETHING PERPETUALLY
THE NOISE APPEARED TO ROUSE HIM
I WAS THINKING OF THE STRIKES WE HAVE GONE THROUGH WHICH ARE TROUBLESOME AND INJURIOUS THINGS ENOUGH AS I AM FINDING TO MY COST
SHE COULD NOT THINK OF HER OWN LOSS IN THINKING OF HER FATHER'S CASE
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER ALTOGETHER
I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS
SO THEM'S THE DIFFERENT VIEWS WE TAKE ON TH STRIKE QUESTION BUT SAID MARGARET IF THE PEOPLE STRUCK AS YOU CALL IT WHERE I COME FROM AS THEY ARE MOSTLY ALL FIELD LABOURERS THE SEED WOULD NOT BE SOWN THE HAY GOT IN THE CORN REAPED WELL SAID HE
AND ALL SO CHANGED
LISTLESSLY SHE SAT THERE ON THE GROUND HER HANDS CLASPED ROUND HER KNEES WHILE HER AUNT SHAW DID SMALL SHOPPINGS AND EDITH AND CAPTAIN LENNOX RODE FAR AND WIDE ON SHORE AND INLAND
THERE'S MANY A TIME WHEN I'VE THOUGHT I DIDNA BELIEVE IN GOD BUT I'VE NEVER PUT IT FAIR OUT BEFORE ME IN WORDS AS MANY MEN DO
I DO NOT LIKE YOU TO REST EVEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF AN IMPROPRIETY
BUT HER FATHER REMEMBERED THIS TOO AND SHE SILENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GREATER RIGHT TO THE ONE WINDOW FROM WHICH IT COULD BE SEEN
ONLY DO COME IN NOW
IT'S LITTLE BLAME TO THEM IF THEY DO GO INTO TH GIN-SHOP FOR TO MAKE THEIR BLOOD FLOW QUICKER AND MORE LIVELY AND SEE THINGS THEY NEVER SEE AT NO OTHER TIME--PICTURES AND LOOKING-GLASS AND SUCH LIKE
GO OUT AND TAKE A WALK AND COME IN SOMETHING LIKE
NOW YO'VE GOT IT
THE QUESTION ALWAYS IS HAS EVERYTHING BEEN DONE TO MAKE THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE EXCEPTIONS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE
THAT SHE WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOR PURE ENOUGH TO BE INDIFFERENT TO THE LOWERED OPINION OF A FELLOW CREATURE
THEY HAD TOLD HER THAT HER AUNT SHAW WAS COMING
HE DRANK TO DROWN CARE AS HE WOULD HAVE HIMSELF EXPRESSED IT
TELL US BOTH
SHE WONDERED IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT
SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED'--AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
BUT WHAT IN FIVE MINUTES
MARGARET DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAVISHNESS OF COALS WAS A SIGN OF HOSPITABLE WELCOME TO HER ON MARY'S PART AND THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT WAS NECESSARY FOR BESSY
BUT THIS IDEA WAS NOT KINDLY RECEIVED BY HIS WIFE
TRYING TO DETECT THE SECRET OF THE GREAT RISE IN THE PRICE OF COTTON UGH
SHE REMEMBERED HER SPIRIT AS SHOWN AT VARIOUS TIMES AND PLACES EVEN MORE THAN THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENDURED LONG AND WEARING CARES
THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN--TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT
IT HAD BEEN MORE LIKE THE BEDS AT SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD SLEPT ON SINCE
YOU SHALL HAVE RELIEF FROM YOUR COMPLAINTS WHATEVER THEY ARE SHALL THEM IRISH BLACKGUARDS BE PACKED BACK AGAIN ASKED ONE FROM OUT THE CROWD WITH FIERCE THREATENING IN HIS VOICE
DIXON WAS NOT UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS AWED REVERENCE WHICH WAS GIVEN TO HER
I SHOULD NEVER DARE TO GO DOWN SOME OF THOSE STREETS WITHOUT A SERVANT
AND CAN YOUR FACTORY FRIEND COME ON THURSDAY TO SEE YOU DRESSED SHE WAS SO ILL I NEVER THOUGHT OF ASKING HER SAID MARGARET DOLEFULLY
DELHI
THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL
AND THEN WHERE THINK YE THAT HE WENT
HE LEANED ONE HAND ON THE TABLE AS IF TO SUPPORT HIMSELF
THEY WERE GLAD TO HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO THE CONVERSATION
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF YOUR TOWN I CONFESS I DON'T SEE WHAT THERE IS TO BE PROUD OF
AN AUGUST SUN BEAT STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE STREET AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
SHE WAS TO BE JOHN'S WIFE
IT'S BOLTED
SHE WOULD KEEP HER SECRET AND BEAR THE BURDEN ALONE
NOW YO SAY THESE ARE TRUE THINGS AND TRUE SAYINGS AND A TRUE LIFE
I THINK A DEAL ON HER FOR SURE
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU IF YOU WOULD GIVE UP THAT EVERLASTING WALK WALK WALK HE SAT DOWN INSTANTLY ON A CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL
AFTER A QUIET LIFE IN A COUNTRY PARSONAGE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS THERE WAS SOMETHING DAZZLING TO MR HALE IN THE ENERGY WHICH CONQUERED IMMENSE DIFFICULTIES WITH EASE
HER LAST WORDS WERE GIVE HER MY AFFECTIONATE RESPECTS
BUT IT WAS WITH NO VIEW OF SEEING HER THAT HE LINGERED
I HOPE MISS THORNTON IS WELL PUT IN MR HALE DESIROUS OF CHANGING THE CURRENT OF THE CONVERSATION
MOREOVER I MYSELF WILL BE HER PREUX CHEVALIER SIXTY AND GOUTY THOUGH I BE
SHE'S BETTER NOW
DESPISE MY SON
ONLY IF YOU CAN COME IN AND MAKE A THIRD IN THE STUDY I SHALL BE GLAD OH YES--THANK YOU BUT AS MR HALE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE RAN AFTER HIM
SO HE WAITED AND STOOD ON ONE SIDE WITH PROFOUND HUMILITY AS THE NEWS SWEPT THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF THE ENORMOUS FORTUNE WHICH HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW HAD MADE BY HIS DARING SPECULATION
ARE WE TO LIVE HERE ASKED MRS HALE IN BLANK DISMAY
WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE SPANISH HOUSES AND INTO IT HE WAS RECEIVED AS A JUNIOR PARTNER
ONE OF THE PORTERS RUSHING OUT TO BE IN READINESS FOR THE TRAIN HAD SEEN A SCUFFLE AT THE OTHER END OF THE PLATFORM BETWEEN LEONARDS AND A GENTLEMAN ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY BUT HEARD NO NOISE
THE FRONT ROOM DOWN-STAIRS IS TO BE YOUR STUDY AND OUR DINING-ROOM POOR PAPA FOR YOU KNOW WE SETTLED MAMMA IS TO HAVE AS CHEERFUL A SITTING-ROOM AS WE CAN GET
WHEN I HAVE GONE FOR AN OUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GET HIGH UP AND SEE FAR AWAY AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH O FULNESS IN THAT AIR
SHE LIKED MRS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER
YOU DO NOT REALLY MEAN IT MR HALE SAT IN RIGID STILLNESS WHILE SHE SPOKE
SHE IS NOT EIGHTEEN
BESSY--WE HAVE A FATHER IN HEAVEN I KNOW IT
MISS HALE I WAS VERY UNGRATEFUL YESTERDAY YOU HAD NOTHING TO BE GRATEFUL FOR SAID SHE RAISING HER EYES AND LOOKING FULL AND STRAIGHT AT HIM
HE'S ONE O TH OUD-FASHIONED SORT
YOU MY OWN JOHN THORNTON THOUGH YOU AND I MAY BE BEGGARS TOGETHER--MY OWN DEAR SON SHE FELL UPON HIS NECK AND KISSED HIM THROUGH HER TEARS
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY MAY NOT HAVE MADE THEIR WAY FROM PINNER'S LANE INTO THE STABLE-YARD
I WOULD NA HA TROUBLED YO BUT THAT I WERE BID TO COME BY ONE AS SEEMED TO THINK YO'D GETTEN SOME SOFT PLACE IN YO'R HEART
IT'S VERY HARD UPON A MAN THAT HE CAN'T GO TO THE ONLY COMFORT LEFT MARGARET FELT THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED HER POWER
IT WAS THE PLACE TO LEAVE THE TRAIN AND TAKE THE FLY TO HELSTONE
HE HAD BETTER COME UP HERE DIXON
IT SEEMS SO SELFISH IN ME TO REGRET IT TRYING TO SMILE AND YET HE IS LOST TO ME AND I AM SO LONELY MR LENNOX TURNED OVER HIS PAPERS AND WISHED THAT HE WERE AS RICH AND PROSPEROUS AS HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD BE SOME DAY
I AM GETTING VERY BRAVE AND VERY HARD
BESIDES THIS IMPROVEMENT OF FEELING BOTH MR THORNTON AND HIS WORKMEN FOUND OUT THEIR IGNORANCE AS TO POSITIVE MATTERS OF FACT KNOWN HERETOFORE TO ONE SIDE BUT NOT TO THE OTHER
YOU NEVER DID I HOPE
SHE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE
WE WILL TURN BACK AND BY GOD'S HELP WE MAY FIND THE LOST PATH SO SHE ROSE UP AND DETERMINED AT ONCE TO SET TO ON SOME WORK WHICH SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF HERSELF
HE WOULD SIGH ALOUD AS HE ANSWERED THAT IF HE COULD DO WHAT HE OUGHT IN LITTLE HELSTONE HE SHOULD BE THANKFUL
THEY NEEDED THIS GLEAM OF BRIGHTNESS IN-DOORS FOR OUT-OF-DOORS EVEN TO THEIR UNINSTRUCTED EYES THERE WAS A GLOOMY BROODING APPEARANCE OF DISCONTENT
CALL JOHN I SAY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY THE GATHERING TRAMP--TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING INSTEAD OF HEEDING MARGARET'S WORDS--WAS HEARD JUST RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WALL AND AN INCREASING DIN OF ANGRY VOICES RAGED BEHIND THE WOODEN BARRIER WHICH SHOOK AS IF THE UNSEEN MADDENED CROWD MADE BATTERING-RAMS OF THEIR BODIES AND RETREATED A SHORT SPACE ONLY TO COME WITH MORE UNITED STEADY IMPETUS AGAINST IT TILL THEIR GREAT BEATS MADE THE STRONG GATES QUIVER LIKE REEDS BEFORE THE WIND
OH MAMMA MAMMA I WISH I HAD NEVER GONE TO AUNT SHAW'S AND BEEN ALL THOSE PRECIOUS YEARS AWAY FROM YOU
THIS OF COURSE INCLUDES DIXON
AUNT SHAW WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE BABY
THE DOCTORS SAID THE FEVER WAS CATCHING BUT THEY CARED NONE FOR THAT--ONLY MISS FANNY AND SHE WENT A-VISITING THESE FOLK THAT SHE IS GOING TO MARRY INTO
MARGARET SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING AS THANKFUL AS SHE WAS AT THE PRESENCE OF A THIRD PARTY ON THIS THEIR FIRST MEETING SINCE THE MEMORABLE DAY OF HIS OFFER AND HER REFUSAL AT HELSTONE
BUT THIS STREET IS QUITE EMPTY I THINK SHE WENT ACROSS THE YARD AND UP THE STEPS TO THE HOUSE DOOR
IT MAY NOT BE ALWAYS AS A MASTER BUT AS AN OVER-LOOKER A CASHIER A BOOK-KEEPER A CLERK ONE ON THE SIDE OF AUTHORITY AND ORDER YOU CONSIDER ALL WHO ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THEMSELVES IN THE WORLD FROM WHATEVER CAUSE AS YOUR ENEMIES THEN IF I UNDER-STAND YOU RIGHTLY SAID MARGARET IN A CLEAR COLD VOICE
EITHER YOU HAVE MADE SOME GREAT MISTAKE OR I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU NO MOTHER I HAVE MADE NO MISTAKE
BESIDES IF HE IS NOT WELL HE WON'T WISH FOR INVITATIONS
HE WOULD SURELY HAVE TOLD ME BEFORE IT CAME TO THIS IT CAME STRONGLY UPON MARGARET'S MIND THAT HER MOTHER OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TOLD
HERE IS THE NOTE SHE CONTINUED SUDDENLY INTERPRETING THE MEANING OF THE HAND HELD OUT TO RECEIVE IT
THE CONVERSATION AT DINNER FLOWED ON QUIETLY AND AGREEABLY
AND YOU AND MARGARET SHOULD COME AND LIVE AT THE PARSONAGE--YOU TO BE A SORT OF LAY CURATE AND TAKE THE UNWASHED OFF MY HANDS
HE KNEW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THEIR HANDS HAD MET THOUGH SHE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT
SO SHE WENT ON
I OWE TO HER,--BUT WHAT WILL SHE SAY I CAN GUESS
YOU SHALL MAKE ME SOME TEA MARGARET
MARGARET HAD TO PULL HERSELF UP FROM INDULGING A BAD TRICK WHICH SHE HAD LATELY FALLEN INTO OF TRYING TO IMAGINE HOW EVERY EVENT THAT SHE HEARD OF IN RELATION TO MR THORNTON WOULD AFFECT HIM
HOW YOU PROFESS TO UNDERSTAND THESE HALES AND HOW YOU NEVER WILL ALLOW THAT WE CAN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM
I SHALL GET PROUD IF I THINK I CAN DO GOOD TO YO YOU WON'T DO IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
IT IS VERY LATE
SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MR HALE QUIETLY
SHE LOOKS TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN SHE DID IN HARLEY STREET THAT'S THE BONNET I GOT HER SAID EDITH TRIUMPHANTLY
THEY REACHED THE COTTAGE WHERE SUSAN'S WIDOWED MOTHER LIVED
WE WERE BOTH UNCONSCIOUSLY AND CONSCIOUSLY TEACHING EACH OTHER YOU SAY WERE I TRUST YOU ARE INTENDING TO PURSUE THE SAME COURSE I MUST STOP COLTHURST SAID HENRY LENNOX HASTILY
IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME
SHE DID NOT HEAR WHAT MRS HEPWORTH WAS SAYING AND LEFT IT TO MR BELL TO REPLY LOOKING ROUND MEANWHILE FOR HER OLD ACQUAINTANCES
AND HE UNDERSTOOD ALL THIS BY INSTINCT
AND HE DREADED THE ADMISSION OF ANY THOUGHT OF HER AS A MOTIVE TO WHAT HE WAS DOING SOLELY BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT
MARGARET'S STRENGTH WAS SO UTTERLY EXHAUSTED BY THESE VISITS THAT SHE HAD TO SUBMIT TO MUCH WATCHING AND PETTING AND SIGHING I-TOLD-YOU-SO'S FROM HER AUNT
SHE SAW THEIR GESTURE--SHE KNEW ITS MEANING,--SHE READ THEIR AIM
SHE LOOKED
THE THOUGHT OF THE LAST KNOWING WHAT SHE HAD DONE EVEN IN HIS OWN BEHALF WAS THE MOST PAINFUL FOR THE BROTHER AND SISTER WERE IN THE FIRST FLUSH OF THEIR MUTUAL REGARD AND LOVE
I HAVE BEEN SORRY TO HEAR OF ALL SHE HAS HAD TO BEAR
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AN INVITATION TO DINNER
WHAT COULD SHE SAY
I WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE HOTEL WHERE YOU CAN ORDER LUNCH AND REST AND BY THE TIME IT IS READY I SHALL BE WITH YOU
STILL IT IS OPEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE IT OH NO SAID MARGARET
MRS THORNTON
THE ONLY TIME I SAW MISS HALE SHE TREATED ME WITH A HAUGHTY CIVILITY WHICH HAD A STRONG FLAVOUR OF CONTEMPT IN IT
THAT MR HALE SO I AM MOTHER
THEY GO HOME BRUTISHLY TIRED POOR CREATURES
AT FIRST WHEN I HEARD FROM ONE OF MY SERVANTS THAT YOU HAD BEEN SEEN WALKING ABOUT WITH A GENTLEMAN SO FAR FROM HOME AS THE OUTWOOD STATION AT SUCH A TIME OF THE EVENING I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
IT IS BLASPHEMOUS
THEN I NEED NOT TELL SHOLTO NOT TO ASK MR MONTAGU SO OFTEN TO THE HOUSE JUST AS YOU CHOOSE SAID HE WITH FORCED COOLNESS
I THINK HE'S BEEN THERE EVER SINCE AND IT IS NOW JUST ONE SIR FIVE HOURS THOUGHT MR THORNTON
BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES
NOW THAT THE GENERAL BEING GONE SHE HAD EVERY GOOD OF LIFE WITH AS FEW DRAWBACKS AS POSSIBLE SHE HAD BEEN RATHER PERPLEXED TO FIND AN ANXIETY IF NOT A SORROW
SOME OF THE SHOPMEN VERY LIKELY SAID MARGARET INDIFFERENTLY
HE MUST HAVE SOME PAY FOR SERVING WITH THE SPANISH ARMY FREDERICK MUST NOT SUFFER SAID MARGARET DECIDEDLY
WHAT HAD LEONARDS SAID
SHE READ THIS MEANING TOO IN THE MAN'S EYES
THEY HAD STATED THAT DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE FALL OR BY THE SUBSEQUENT DRINKING AND EXPOSURE TO COLD
SHE SATE DOWN IN THE ROCKING CHAIR AND HELD THE WOMAN UPON HER KNEES HER HEAD LYING ON MARGARET'S SHOULDER
A POOR WEAK LITTLE SMILE
THEN AS TO DRESS AND DIXON AND PERSONAL EXPENSES AND CONFECTIONERY ALL YOUNG LADIES EAT CONFECTIONERY TILL WISDOM COMES BY AGE I SHALL CONSULT SOME LADY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU WILL HAVE FROM YOUR FATHER BEFORE FIXING THIS
BUT MASTERS HAS GETTEN TH UPPER HAND SOMEHOW
BUT YO MUN PROMISE NOT GIVE IT TO HIM
NO ONE LOVES ME,--NO ONE CARES FOR ME BUT YOU MOTHER HE TURNED AWAY AND STOOD LEANING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE TEARS FORCING THEMSELVES INTO HIS MANLY EYES
WHEN THEY HAD SET OUT UPON THEIR WALK MR BELL SAID
I DECLARE MARGARET--YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR YES MAMMA TOLD ME WELL WHEN ALL THE SAILORS WHO WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING WERE INDIGNANT WITH OUR CAPTAIN THIS FELLOW TO CURRY FAVOUR--PAH
NAY MARGARET I'M GLAD IT IS DONE THOUGH I DURST NOT HAVE DONE IT MYSELF
NOW MR HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT STOOD DREAMILY BY THE STUDY WINDOW UNTIL THE POSTMAN HAD CALLED OR GONE DOWN THE LANE GIVING A HALF-RESPECTFUL HALF-CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET-BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART AND AN OCCUPIED MIND
MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT
WHY THE MAYOR HISSEL DINES THERE
I WONDER IF THERE ARE MANY FOLK LIKE HER DOWN SOUTH
AS IF SHE FELT HIS LOOK SHE TURNED TO HIM AND ASKED A QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME IN HER MIND
BUT I'M NONE DAUNTED
I'M LEFT ALONE TO MANAGE THESE CHILDER AND NOUGHT FOR TO GIVE EM FOR TO KEEP EM QUIET
IT WOULD HAVE SUITED HIS BOOK WELL ENOUGH
HE STOOD BESIDE HIM ON HIS WEDDING-DAY
IT'S NO USE HIGGINS
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN BUT HE KEPT HIS HOLD ON HER ARM
I AM SORRY YOU HAVE HAD THE TROUBLE OF CALLING TWICE MR THORNTON WAS IN HABITS OF AUTHORITY HIMSELF BUT SHE SEEMED TO ASSUME SOME KIND OF RULE OVER HIM AT ONCE
BUT WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER INVECTIVE AGAINST THE DEAD LANGUAGES HE QUIETLY RETURNED TO THE SHORT CURT DECIDED EXPRESSION OF HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD GO AND SEE MRS HALE AT THE TIME APPOINTED AS MOST LIKELY TO BE CONVENIENT TO THE INVALID
WHILE THAT LITTLE LADY OVERCOME BY WOUNDED FEELING LAY LIKE A VICTIM ON THE SOFA HEAVING OCCASIONALLY A PROFOUND SIGH TILL AT LAST SHE FELL ASLEEP
HE CAME VERY SELDOM EVEN FOR THE DULL COLD PURPOSE OF LESSONS
BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
BUT SHE WOULD READ THE LETTER AND SEE
WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED TO HER AND FOUND HIS OLD ENEMY CAPTAIN REID IN COMMAND HE DID MEAN TO BEAR ALL HIS TYRANNY PATIENTLY
I NEVER COULD ABIDE HIM
WHEN THE LANDLADY DID APPEAR--AND THEY MIGHT HAVE ABSTRACTED MANY AN ARTICLE FIRST--SHE GAVE THEM A KIND WELCOME ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN INVITED GUESTS AND APOLOGISED FOR HER COMING HAVING BEEN SO DELAYED BY SAYING THAT IT WAS HAY-TIME AND THE PROVISIONS FOR THE MEN HAD TO BE SENT A-FIELD AND SHE HAD BEEN TOO BUSY PACKING UP THE BASKETS TO HEAR THE NOISE OF WHEELS OVER THE ROAD WHICH SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THE HIGHWAY RAN OVER SOFT SHORT TURF
IS THERE NECESSITY FOR CALLING IT A BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES ASKED MR HALE
MR HALE SPOKE NEXT
SHE DOUBTED IF ANY ONE OF THAT OLD SET EVER THOUGHT OF HER EXCEPT HENRY LENNOX
BUT IT IS ON A LITTLE MATTER OF BUSINESS I MADE SO BOLD AS TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW
MARGARET WISHED THAT SHE HAD BEEN SENT AWAY ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AS SHE FANCIED IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT STRANGE TO GIVE A SERVANT A HOLIDAY WHEN HER MISTRESS'S STATE REQUIRED SO MUCH ATTENDANCE
MR BELL GOT UP AND LOOKED AROUND HIM FOR HIS HAT WHICH HAD BEEN REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR TEA
A MORNING CALL LITERALLY IN THE DEWY MORNING
I WOULD NA ASK FOR WORK FOR MYSEL
ARE THERE ANY COMFORTS OR DAINTIES SHE OUGHT TO HAVE NO REPLIED THE DOCTOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
AY SAID HE
SHE WENT TO THE END AND LOOKED OVER SOMEWHAT FEARFULLY
THE HOUSE FRONTED THE VILLAGE GREEN
I THINK I LOVE HIM A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN MY HUSBAND WHO IS GETTING STOUT AND GRUMPY,--WHAT HE CALLS BUSY NO
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I USE THE RIGHT WORDS BUT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN DO YOU GIVE YOUR SERVANTS REASONS FOR YOUR EXPENDITURE OR YOUR ECONOMY IN THE USE OF YOUR OWN MONEY
INDEED LONG PAST INFANCY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE HAPPIEST UNDER THE UNFAILING LAWS OF A DISCREET FIRM AUTHORITY
I MADE HIM
BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR SORROW
HE WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO SLIGHT HIS NEW FRIEND BY ANY DISRESPECTFUL UNPUNCTUALITY
BUT WHO WOULD NE'ER INJURE PROPERTY OR LIFE
AS IF HER WHOLE SENSES WERE ACUTELY VITAL AND ALL ENDUED WITH DOUBLE KEENNESS FOR THE PURPOSES OF WATCHING
AND I'VE HEARD TELL O MEN WHO DIDN'T LIKE WORKING PLACES WHERE THERE WAS A WHEEL BECAUSE THEY SAID AS HOW IT MAD EM HUNGRY AT AFTER THEY'D BEEN LONG USED TO SWALLOWING FLUFF TO GO WITHOUT IT AND THAT THEIR WAGE OUGHT TO BE RAISED IF THEY WERE TO WORK IN SUCH PLACES
AT BREAKFAST-TIME HE INTERESTED MR HALE WITH VIVID GRAPHIC RATTLING ACCOUNTS OF THE WILD LIFE HE HAD LED IN MEXICO SOUTH AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE
THERE'S SUMMUT IN TH WEATHER I RECKON AS SETS FOLK A-WANDERING
ABOUT MARY SAID BESSY
ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN OUR DOINGS ARE SURE TO BE CANVASSED BY EVERY SCRIBBLER WHO CAN HOLD A PEN THANK YOU SHE ANSWERED COLDLY
AND THEN HE CAN SEE US BOTH AND CHOOSE WHICH HE LIKES FOR HIS LISTENER OH
THAT WILL NEVER DO
YOU KNOW THAT GIRL OF YOURS HAS GOT PRETTY NEARLY ALL MY HEART
CHAPTER V DECISION I ASK THEE FOR A THOUGHTFUL LOVE THROUGH CONSTANT WATCHING WISE TO MEET THE GLAD WITH JOYFUL SMILES AND TO WIPE THE WEEPING EYES
MARGARET MADE A GOOD LISTENER TO ALL HER MOTHER'S LITTLE PLANS FOR ADDING SOME SMALL COMFORTS TO THE LOT OF THE POORER PARISHIONERS
SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE WOUND UP THE DINNER IN THE PROPER WAY AND WITH ALL THE CEREMONIES WHICH HAD GONE ON SO SMOOTHLY HITHERTO ESPECIALLY AS SHE AND DIXON HAD GOT OUT THE FINGER-GLASSES FROM THE STORE-ROOM ON PURPOSE TO BE AS CORRECT AS BECAME GENERAL SHAW'S WIDOW'S SISTER BUT AS MR HALE GOT UP DIRECTLY AND PREPARED TO ACCOMPANY HIS GUEST SHE COULD ONLY SUBMIT
AND WHEN I TREMBLED SO ALL OVER THAT I COULD NOT SPEAK HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND STOOPED DOWN HIS HEAD ON MINE AND BEGAN TO SHAKE AND TO CRY IN A STRANGE MUFFLED GROANING VOICE TILL I FOR VERY FRIGHT STOOD QUITE STILL AND ONLY BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME WHAT HE HAD HEARD
AND SEEING THE PLENTY PROVIDED BY MRS HALE AND SOMEWHAT LAVISHLY USED BY THE CHILDREN WHO WERE MASTERS DOWN-STAIRS IN THEIR FATHER'S ABSENCE HE CAME BACK WITH A MORE CONSOLING AND CHEERFUL ACCOUNT THAN MARGARET HAD DARED TO HOPE FOR
LOOK AT THOSE CHIMNEYS
FOR SURE TH WORLD IS IN A CONFUSION THAT PASSES ME OR ANY OTHER MAN TO UNDERSTAND
I WISH WE HAD HIM TO PUT DOWN THIS STRIKE FOR US CROMWELL IS NO HERO OF MINE SAID SHE COLDLY
PRESENTLY DIXON CAME TO THE DOOR AND SAID MISS HALE YOU ARE WANTED DIXON'S MANNER WAS SO FLURRIED THAT MARGARET TURNED SICK AT HEART
IT HURT HER TO SEE THE HELSTONE ROAD SO FLOODED IN THE SUN-LIGHT AND EVERY TURN AND EVERY FAMILIAR TREE SO PRECISELY THE SAME IN ITS SUMMER GLORY AS IT HAD BEEN IN FORMER YEARS
WE WENT INTO A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN WHERE LIVING WAS CHEAPER THAN IN MILTON AND WHERE I GOT EMPLOYMENT IN A DRAPER'S SHOP A CAPITAL PLACE BY THE WAY FOR OBTAINING A KNOWLEDGE OF GOODS WEEK BY WEEK OUR INCOME CAME TO FIFTEEN SHILLINGS OUT OF WHICH THREE PEOPLE HAD TO BE KEPT
SOMEBODY COME ON AN ERRAND HE LOOKED LIKE SOME ONE OF THAT KIND SAID FREDERICK CARELESSLY
AND SHE HERSELF WAS AFRAID OF ONE OF HER OLD ATTACKS OF THE NERVES
HE TOLD US NOT TO WAIT MR THORNTON HAD DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO INQUIRY OF HIS MOTHER AS TO HOW FAR SHE HAD PUT HER PROJECT INTO EXECUTION OF SPEAKING TO MARGARET ABOUT THE IMPROPRIETY OF HER CONDUCT
AND I WILL TOO IF THEY GO ON LONG
THEN HE SAID SHORTLY ENOUGH
DIXON FOLLOWED HER BY MRS SHAW'S DESIRE OSTENSIBLY TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS BUT WITH A PRIVATE INJUNCTION TO SOOTHE HER INTO REPOSE AS SOON AS MIGHT BE
THEY DO NOT SEEM TO ME OUT OF THE COMMON WAY SAID MRS THORNTON
YOU'RE NOT TO THINK THAT IF I COULD HAVE FORESEEN ALL THAT WOULD COME OF MY CHANGE OF OPINION AND MY RESIGNATION OF MY LIVING--NO
AND YET THEY'RE NOT RICH FROM ALL I CAN HEAR THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN AND SHE'S NOT ACCOMPLISHED MAMMA
EDITH REMAINED TO FIDGET ABOUT
WILL YOU SIT DOWN
BEHIND THE DOOR WAS ANOTHER TABLE DECKED OUT FOR TEA WITH A WHITE TABLECLOTH ON WHICH FLOURISHED THE COCOA-NUT CAKES AND A BASKET PILED WITH ORANGES AND RUDDY AMERICAN APPLES HEAPED ON LEAVES
POOR POOR MARIA
IT'S A LONG STORY
IT'S PROFESSIONAL SAID HE
HE PUT THEM DOWN WITH A SIGH
BUT HE WOULD SPEAK HIS MIND TO CAPTAIN REID AND SO IT WENT ON FROM BAD TO WORSE
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
FANCY EDITH A MAMMA
I KNOW IT FROM YOUR FACE
ANXIOUS ONLY FOR A LOOK A WORD OF HERS BEFORE WHICH TO PROSTRATE HIMSELF IN PENITENT HUMILITY
I TOOK IT MYSELF OH MARGARET I'M SO AFRAID OF HIS COMING
LAID HER DOWN SOFTLY AND LOOKING ON HER PURE WHITE FACE THE SENSE OF WHAT SHE WAS TO HIM CAME UPON HIM SO KEENLY THAT HE SPOKE IT OUT IN HIS PAIN
I AM SORRY SHE REPLIED AND BEGAN TO TURN OVER IN HER MIND THE POSSIBILITY OF HIDING PART OF IT AT LEAST BY SOME OF HER SKETCHES BUT GAVE UP THE IDEA AT LAST AS LIKELY ONLY TO MAKE BAD WORSE
WE MUST GO BACK TO THE SECOND I THINK
THAT IS ALL VERY FINE IN THEORY THAT PLAN OF FORGETTING WHATEVER IS PAINFUL BUT IT WILL BE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR ME AT LEAST TO CARRY IT INTO EXECUTION YOU ARE VEXED SAID SHE SADLY
OH MY MARGARET--MY MARGARET
DO YOU NOT I
THERE WOULD BE NO ONE TO GO AND READ TO HIM AND COMFORT HIM WITH LITTLE PORRINGERS OF BROTH AND GOOD RED FLANNEL
I WONDER WHAT ROOM THEY WILL MAKE INTO THE NURSERY
TO BE SURE IN HER QUIET BLACK DRESS SHE WAS A CONTRAST TO EDITH DANCING IN HER WHITE CRAPE MOURNING AND LONG FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR ALL SOFTNESS AND GLITTER
NOW THAT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAMING MEMORY OF SOME FORMER LIFE;--EVERYTHING THAT HAD PASSED OUT OF DOORS SEEMED DISSEVERED FROM HER MOTHER AND THEREFORE UNREAL
SHE WISHED THAT HE WOULD GO AS HE HAD ONCE SPOKEN OF DOING INSTEAD OF SITTING THERE ANSWERING WITH CURT SENTENCES ALL THE REMARKS SHE MADE
BESSY'LL THINK A DEAL O THEM FLOWERS
BUT I THINK IN A FORTNIGHT;--AFTER MY DEED OF RESIGNATION IS SENT IN I SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMAIN
MEDICAL EVIDENCE NOT SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY IT
BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB
AS DIXON PLEASES
THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK-KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST
IT WAS THE STURDY WILFULNESS OF A MAN USUALLY MOST REASONABLE AND SELF-CONTROLLED
IT'S MISSUS MASTER FREDERICK AND HER
BUT I WERE TAUGHT THAT IT WAS MANNERS TO SAY EITHER YES OR NO WHEN I WERE AXED A CIVIL QUESTION
AND WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR THE NEW DINING-ROOM
MARGARET HEARD HER MURMUR TO HERSELF
HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND TREMBLING WITH TENDER PASSION AS HE SAID MARGARET FOR AN INSTANT SHE LOOKED UP
I SHALL NEVER LOVE ANY PLACE LIKE YOU
PERHAPS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND HIM HE HAS GONE TO A MR DONKIN'S IN CANUTE STREET
THE WANT OF A MAN'S INTERCOURSE WITH MEN
EVEN HAMPER WI ALL HIS BULLYING WOULD HA WAITED A WHILE--BUT IT'S A WORD AND A BLOW WI THORNTON
MANY IN THE CROWD WERE MERE BOYS
THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD BEEN ONE CONTINUED SERIES OF OPPOSITION
BUT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
THEY MUST IF POSSIBLE BE RELET
HE DIED QUITE SUDDENLY WHEN ON A VISIT TO ME AT OXFORD
AND WHAT THEN
HIGGINS'S DOOR WAS LOCKED THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY WENT TO PAY THEIR CALL ON THE WIDOW BOUCHER
AT LAST SHE BURST OUT DON'T GO ON READING
MOREOVER HE IS YOUR GODFATHER
FAR AWAY IN TIME FAR AWAY IN SPACE SEEMED ALL THE INTERESTS OF PAST DAYS
YOU CAN SPEAK OF HER IN THAT MEASURED WAY AS SIMPLY A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE"--ONLY SOMETHING TO CATCH THE EYE
BUT SHE WENT ON
THOUGHT MARGARET
HER FATHER HAD LEFT HER TO GO INTO MILTON UPON SOME BUSINESS
FOR HE'S IN A STRANGE KIND OF WAY
AND WHEN THE FAMILY GATHERED AT DINNER-TIME MARGARET WAS SO SILENT AND ABSORBED THAT EDITH VOTED HER MOPED AND HAILED A PROPOSAL OF HER HUSBAND'S WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT MR HENRY LENNOX SHOULD BE ASKED TO TAKE CROMER FOR A WEEK ON HIS RETURN FROM SCOTLAND IN OCTOBER
AND WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH HER FOR SAYING THAT IT WOULD NOT SIGNIFY IF IT DID NOT GO TILL MORNING AS SHE KNEW HIGGINS HAD PROVIDED FOR THEIR IMMEDIATE WANTS AND SHE HERSELF HAD LEFT MONEY WITH BESSY
HE LABOURS AND HIS LABOUR COMES TO NOUGHT
I FELT SMOTHERED LIKE DOWN BELOW
BUT IT MUST BE VERY SAD TO BE ILL IN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BACK STREETS HER KINDLY NATURE PREVAILING AND THE OLD HELSTONE HABITS OF THOUGHT RETURNING IT'S BAD ENOUGH HERE
THERE WAS A FILMY VEIL OF SOFT DULL MIST OBSCURING BUT NOT HIDING ALL OBJECTS GIVING THEM A LILAC HUE FOR THE SUN HAD NOT YET FULLY SET
AN OBSTINATE CHAP EVERY INCH ON HIM,--TH OUD BULLDOG POOR BESSY SAID MARGARET TURNING ROUND TO HER
BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE COUNTRY CLERGYMEN LIVE SUCH ISOLATED LIVES--ISOLATED I MEAN FROM ALL INTERCOURSE WITH MEN OF EQUAL CULTIVATION WITH THEMSELVES BY WHOSE MINDS THEY MIGHT REGULATE THEIR OWN AND DISCOVER WHEN THEY WERE GOING EITHER TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW--THAT THEY ARE VERY APT TO DISTURB THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY DOUBTS AS TO THE ARTICLES OF FAITH AND THROW UP CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES OF DOING GOOD FOR VERY UNCERTAIN FANCIES OF THEIR OWN I DIFFER FROM YOU
BUT I MERELY THREW OUT A SUGGESTION OF WHAT MIGHT BE
AND THE WHITE SHINING DRESS ON YO'VE GETTEN TO WEAR
I HAVE REALLY HAD TOO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT TO SETTLE THIS
IT WAS BETTER THAT THE NIGHT SHOULD PASS OVER BEFORE SHE WAS TOLD OF HER SON'S ARRIVAL
THE CARRIAGE COULD FETCH HER AND SHE COULD SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY HERE WHICH I KNOW SHE WOULD LIKE MRS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK
YOU'VE TOO MUCH PRIDE AND SPIRIT IN YOU FOR THAT
DO YOU REMEMBER THE HAPPY EPITHETS YES AND DESPISE THEM YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD
SHE WILL BE QUITE ENVIOUS WHEN SHE HEARS OF EDITH HAVING INDIAN SHAWLS
BUT I FANCY HE DATES FROM HIS WAREHOUSE WHERE IS OUR HOTEL PAPA CLOSE TO THE END OF THIS STREET I BELIEVE
YOU HAVE READ IT BEFORE AND ARE ONLY RECALLING YOUR OLD KNOWLEDGE THAT IS TRUE,--I HAD BLUNDERED ALONG IT AT SCHOOL
YOU CANNOT AVOID IT
HE DID NOT QUITE RELISH THE TONE IN WHICH SHE SPOKE ALTHOUGH THE WORDS BUT EXPRESSED A THOUGHT WHICH HAD PASSED THROUGH HIS OWN MIND
BUT SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF FEELING THAT NO ONE HAD BEEN KEPT WAITING FOR HER
BUT IT'S A CHANCE EVERY MINUTE AS SHE DOESN'T HEAR ON IT IN SOME ROUGHER WAY NOR A PERSON GOING TO MAKE HER LET ON BY DEGREES AS IT WERE PAPA DO YOU GO SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE
AND I AM GLAD YEA GLAD WITH ALL MY HEART THAT THUS SO CLEARLY I MYSELF AM FREE DRAYTON
HERE AND THERE OLD TREES HAD BEEN FELLED THE AUTUMN BEFORE
AND I KNOW WHAT JOHN IS
THE NEXT WAS A WISH TO REMEMBER EVERY WORD OF THE INSPECTOR'S WHICH RELATED TO MR THORNTON
AND IT WAS CONSEQUENTLY PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK BEFORE HE REACHED MR HALE'S
DEAD--COLD AS YOU LIE THERE YOU ARE THE ONLY WOMAN I EVER LOVED
WHY MASTER AND YOU MUST ALWAYS BE ASKING THE LOWER CLASSES UP-STAIRS SINCE WE CAME TO MILTON I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
I MUN SPEAK TO YO COME IN HERE THEN
I DON'T ASK MY UNCLE'--(HERE THE LETTER BECAME MORE CONSTRAINED AND BETTER WRITTEN
BUT I'D JUST LIKE FOR TO SEE TH MEAN AS MAKE TH UNION AND PUT EM ONE BY ONE FACE TO FACE WI BOUCHER
AND I SAT DOWN UNDER THE HEDGE TO WAIT FOR HIM
THEIR BOOK-STUFF GOES IN AT ONE EAR AND OUT AT T'OTHER
MARGARET HAD JUST LEFT THE ROOM AND HE WAS VEXED AT THE STATE OF FEELING BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HER
HE WAS RESTLESS ALL EVENING
IF THE WORLD STOOD STILL IT WOULD RETROGRADE AND BECOME CORRUPT IF THAT IS NOT IRISH
AS DINNER-GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT
THEN DRAWING NEAR TO MARGARET HE SAID IN A LOWER VOICE I SPOKE HASTILY TO YOU ONCE THIS EVENING AND I AM AFRAID RATHER RUDELY
THERE LAY HER MOTHER WITH AN UNMISTAKABLE LOOK ON HER FACE
BUT BY THE BENT DROOPING OF HER HEAD HE GUESSED WHAT HER REPLY WOULD BE
THE NEWLY-MARRIED COUPLE-TO-BE WOULD NEED FRESH HOUSEHOLD STOCKS OF LINEN
SHE HAS HAD A TERRIBLE BLOW SAID MRS THORNTON
STOP
I REFUSE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
AND NOW SHARPER FEELINGS CAME SHOOTING THROUGH HER HEART WHETHER PAIN OR PLEASURE SHE COULD HARDLY TELL
I SHALL HAVE TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH SCORNING MY OWN FOLLY
SO SHE LAID THEM CAREFULLY ON ONE SIDE
I HAD NOT APPROVED OF MY SON'S ATTACHMENT TO YOU WHILE I ONLY SUSPECTED IT
DON'T YOU SEE HOW YOU'VE MADE BOUCHER WHAT HE IS BY DRIVING HIM INTO THE UNION AGAINST HIS WILL--WITHOUT HIS HEART GOING WITH IT
ARE YOU A GOOD JUDGE OF POTATOES AND ONIONS
NO ONE WAS THERE
AND TO THINK OF HIS BEING HERE
ANYHOW THERE'S MANY A ONE AS WORKS IN A CARDING-ROOM THAT FALLS INTO A WASTE COUGHING AND SPITTING BLOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST POISONED BY THE FLUFF BUT CAN'T IT BE HELPED ASKED MARGARET
I WANT YOUR HELP ABOUT--SOMETHING CERTAINLY
SHE WAS GETTING SURFEITED OF THE EVENTLESS EASE IN WHICH NO STRUGGLE OR ENDEAVOUR WAS REQUIRED
THE OTHER ADMIRERS ATTRACTED BY HER APPEARANCE OR THE REPUTATION OF HER FORTUNE WERE SWEPT AWAY BY HER UNCONSCIOUS SMILING DISDAIN INTO THE PATHS FREQUENTED BY OTHER BEAUTIES LESS FASTIDIOUS OR OTHER HEIRESSES WITH A LARGER AMOUNT OF GOLD
I USED TO TEACH HER WHAT LITTLE I KNEW AT NIGHTS
BUT I MUST NOT HAVE MISS HALE SPOKEN OF IN THAT WAY WHICH YOU KNOW IS OFFENSIVE TO ME
MR THORNTON IS PLAIN ENOUGH BUT HE'S NOT LIKE A BULLDOG WITH ITS SHORT BROAD NOSE AND SNARLING UPPER LIP NO
A THREATENING OF A STRIKE
IT TOO WAS PAST
IT WAS THIS LEONARDS I SUPPOSE
NO--NOT TO SAY DRINK REPLIED SHE STILL IN THE SAME WILD EXCITED TONE
INSTEAD OF A QUIET MIDDLE-AGED CLERGYMAN A YOUNG LADY CAME FORWARD WITH FRANK DIGNITY,--A YOUNG LADY OF A DIFFERENT TYPE TO MOST OF THOSE HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING
THE MEEK KIND-HEARTED MR HALE WOULD HAVE READILY TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM IN HIS GRIEF BUT UNLUCKILY THE POINT MARGARET DWELT UPON MOST FORCIBLY WAS THE FACT OF HIS HAVING BEEN DRINKING AND HER HAVING BROUGHT HIM HOME WITH HER AS A LAST EXPEDIENT TO KEEP HIM FROM THE GIN-SHOP
AND SOME COMPLAISANT DOCTOR ORDERED HER JUST WHAT SHE DESIRED,--A WINTER IN ITALY
BUT NOW I AM AFRAID THAT THE TRUTH IS I HAVE BEEN NOTHING BETTER THAN A COCKNEY
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW
THOU'RT LOOKING A SIGHT BETTER ALREADY FOR A LITTLE STIR AND CHANGE
AND NEVER MIND THE DINNER DEAR MAMMA
I WISH YOU COULD SEE IT
IF I TELL YOU ALL PERHAPS YOU COULD BREAK IT TO HER TO-MORROW
IN EVERY CORNER OF THE LETTERS
SO THAT IN THE HOURS IN WHICH I COME IN CONTACT WITH THEM I MUST NECESSARILY BE AN AUTOCRAT
BUT SHE KEPT HER BACK TURNED TO HER SON MUCH LONGER THAN WAS NECESSARY
SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE SAID MR THORNTON DRIVEN TO BAY BY MR BELL'S PERTINACIOUS QUESTIONING
WHAT FINES WE HAVE WE KEEP PRETTY SHARPLY
WHAT WILL YOUR AUNT SHAW SAY IF SHE HEARS YOU USE IT ON HER RETURN OH MAMMA
IT ALMOST SEEMS TO ME A NECESSARY OF LIFE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG
SUCH A DEADLY DISEASE
SO GOOD AFTERNOON JUST BEFORE MR THORNTON CAME UP TO MRS BOUCHER'S DOOR MARGARET CAME OUT OF IT
IT'S NO WONDER TO MY MIND WHEN I HEAR LADIES TALK SUCH A DEAL ABOUT BEING LADIES--AND WHEN THEY'RE SUCH FEARFUL DELICATE DAINTY LADIES TOO--I SAY IT'S NO WONDER TO ME THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY SAINTS ON EARTH OH MARGARET
SHALL YOU OR I DO IT
TRY WORKING WITHIN TWO YARDS O CROWDS O MEN WHO YO KNOW HAVE A GRINDING GRUDGE AT YO IN THEIR HEARTS--TO WHOM IF YO SAY YO'R GLAD NOT AN EYE BRIGHTENS NOR A LIP MOVES,--TO WHOM IF YOUR HEART'S HEAVY YO CAN NEVER SAY NOUGHT BECAUSE THEY'LL NE'ER TAKE NOTICE ON YOUR SIGHS OR SAD LOOKS AND A MAN S NO MAN WHO'LL GROAN OUT LOUD BOUT FOLK ASKING HIM WHAT S THE MATTER?)--JUST YO TRY THAT MISS--TEN HOURS FOR THREE HUNDRED DAYS AND YO'LL KNOW A BIT WHAT TH UNION IS WHY SAID MARGARET WHAT TYRANNY THIS IS
HE WAS STILL AT RIO AND VERY WELL IN HEALTH AND SENT HIS BEST LOVE TO HER
I CAN ASSURE YOU THE HOT DINNERS THE MATRON TURNS OUT ARE BY NO MEANS TO BE DESPISED DO YOU TASTE EACH DISH AS IT GOES IN IN VIRTUE OF YOUR OFFICE
SHE WAS PLEASED THAT MR THORNTON SEEMED IMMEDIATELY TO UNDERSTAND HER FEELING
AND THEN THERE'S THAT BROTHER WHAT BROTHER
IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT BEAUTIES OF OUR SYSTEM THAT A WORKING-MAN MAY RAISE HIMSELF INTO THE POWER AND POSITION OF A MASTER BY HIS OWN EXERTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR
WHO LIVES IN THESE COTTAGES THEY WERE BUILT BY SQUATTERS FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO
SHE THANKED GOD FOR THIS AND THIS ALONE WITH A FERVOUR THAT SWEPT AWAY ALL REBELLIOUS FEELINGS FROM HER MIND
IT WAS ONE EVENING AND IT WAS JUST GETTING RATHER DUSK BUT STILL LIGHT ENOUGH TO RECOGNISE AND BE RECOGNISED AND WE WERE TOO EARLY AND WENT OUT TO WALK IN A FIELD JUST CLOSE BY
THEY'RE AT THE GATES
I'D SWALLOW MY SHADOWS OF DOUBTS AND TAKE A COLLEGE LIVING
THAT'S BEYOND LONDON I RECKON
HE HAD THEN WRITTEN WHEN HE HAD PROMISED AND THEIR ALARM MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED
HE MADE SOME LITTLE CALCULATION
OF COURSE AS YOUR FEELINGS ARE SO DECIDED AND AS THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN SO EVIDENTLY UNPLEASANT TO YOU IT HAD BETTER NOT BE REMEMBERED
AT LAST HIGGINS FOUND WORDS
MORE THE MEMBERS MORE CHANCE FOR EACH ONE SEPARATE MAN HAVING JUSTICE DONE HIM
A BRISK LADY IN BLACK HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE PERCEIVED THEM AND BADE THEM WELCOME WITH SOMEWHAT OF THE HOSTESS-AIR WHICH MARGARET REMEMBERED HER MOTHER WAS WONT TO ASSUME ONLY IN A MORE SOFT AND LANGUID MANNER WHEN ANY RARE VISITORS STRAYED IN TO INSPECT THE SCHOOL
I CANNOT BEAR IT
HE WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SEEING YOU ALONE WITH A YOUNG MAN AS FOR THAT SAID MARGARET RATHER HAUGHTILY I HOLD IT IS HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE YET STILL I SHOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE IT EXPLAINED IF ANY NATURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EASY EXPLANATION OCCURS
ANYTHING FRESH AY TO BE SURE
BUT HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT OF THE RELENTLESS MANNER IN WHICH MUTINIES WERE PUNISHED MADE MARGARET SHIVER AND CREEP
NAY EVEN EVERY TENDENCY TOWARDS VIRTUE WAS USED UP AS MATERIALS FOR FIREWORKS
BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPLAIN OUR REASONS THEY WON'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTING REASONABLY
SHE HEARD THE BUZZ OF VOICES
HE IS LEAVING THE CHURCH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS OPINIONS--HIS DOUBTS WOULD DO HIM NO GOOD AT OXFORD MRS HALE WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME QUIETLY CRYING
IT WILL BE SUCH A COMFORT MAMMA MY POOR CHILD
HE IS A NATIVE OF MILTON-NORTHERN I BELIEVE
HE HASTILY BOLTED IT BEHIND HER
THEY ONLY SEEMED TO START INTO EXISTENCE WHEN SOME WANT OR WHIM OF THEIR MASTER AND MISTRESS NEEDED THEM
BUT HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER FROM HIS COMPANION THE ECHO OF WHOSE THOUGHTS KEPT REPEATING WHERE SHE HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH ALAS
SIMPLY SAYING THAT YOU GAVE ME PAIN BY INSISTING UPON IT SHE REPLIED PROUDLY
STILL SHE WAS SO WEAK THAT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN HER WISH TO SEE MARGARET DRESSED--IF INDEED THAT HAD NOT BEEN THE FEVERISH DESIRE OF A HALF-DELIRIOUS STATE
AND THEN THEY RECKONED THEY WERE SURE O CARRYING TH PUBLIC WITH THEM
IF MRS THORNTON PAID TOO LITTLE MR THORNTON PAID TOO MUCH
YOU SHALL GO AND SEE THEM AND BRING ME BACK A REPORT OF MY SPANISH DAUGHTER NO PAPA I WON'T GO WITHOUT YOU
SO SHE ANSWERED SHORTLY MY HUSBAND IS DEAD
FROM IT THE WANDERING SHEEP OF HER HUSBAND'S FLOCK MIGHT BE SEEN WHO STRAGGLED TO THE TEMPTING BEER-HOUSE UNOBSERVED AS THEY MIGHT HOPE BUT NOT UNOBSERVED IN REALITY
HER FIRST EXCLAMATION WILL BE THAT MAN HUSH SAID MARGARET OR I SHALL TRY AND SHOW YOU YOUR MOTHER'S INDIGNANT TONES AS SHE SAYS THAT WOMAN END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S NORTH AND SOUTH BY ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT RATHER CONTEMPTUOUSLY TOWARDS THE POETS BEFORE WITH THEIR WISHES MINE BE A COT BESIDE A HILL AND THAT SORT OF THING
INDEED SHE DOUBTED IF SHE WAS HEARD AND AS EVERY MOMENT OF DELAY MADE HER RECOIL FROM HER TASK MORE AND MORE SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN SHUTTING IT AFTER HER AND EVEN UNSEEN TO THE WOMAN FASTENING THE BOLT
HE WAS MORE SHUT UP IN HIS STUDY
SHE LOOKED OUT UPON THE DARK-GRAY LINES OF THE CHURCH TOWER SQUARE AND STRAIGHT IN THE CENTRE OF THE VIEW CUTTING AGAINST THE DEEP BLUE TRANSPARENT DEPTHS BEYOND INTO WHICH SHE GAZED AND FELT THAT SHE MIGHT GAZE FOR EVER SEEING AT EVERY MOMENT SOME FARTHER DISTANCE AND YET NO SIGN OF GOD
THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD
SHE WAS SO HAPPY OUT OF DOORS AT HER FATHER'S SIDE THAT SHE ALMOST DANCED
IT WOULD HAVE COME SOON ENOUGH
HOW SHE WAS LEARNING TO DEPEND UPON HIM
BUT HER YOUNG LADY GAVE HER NO ENCOURAGEMENT NOR IN ANY WAY GRATIFIED HER INSINUATING ENQUIRIES HOWEVER DISGUISED IN THE FORM OF SUSPICIONS OR ASSERTIONS
I SHALL BE SURE AND SEND YOU MY ADDRESS WHEN I KNOW IT THE STUDY WAS ALL READY FOR TEA
AND IN CONSEQUENCE I LAID IT ASIDE BOTH AS IMPRACTICABLE AND ALSO BECAUSE IF I FORCED IT INTO OPERATION I SHOULD BE INTERFERING WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF MY MEN
AND JENNINGS THE GROCER'S SHOPMAN,--WELL HE WAS NOT QUITE SO BAD BUT I DOUBT IF I COULD HAVE GOT HIM UP TO AN OATH AFTER HE HEARD THAT MISS HALE FLATLY DENIED IT
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN IN THE OLD WAY MOTHER
THEIR LIVES IS PRETTY MUCH OPEN TO ME
MR THORNTON ABOVE ALL PEOPLE ON WHOM SHE HAD LOOKED DOWN FROM HER IMAGINARY HEIGHTS TILL NOW
AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT SIGNIFY WHERE THEY WENT COMPARED TO THE ONE TERRIBLE CHANGE
BUT I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE LIKED YOU TO HAVE IT
BUT THE LOOK IN HER EYES INTERPRETED IT TO BE A CURSE,--IF NOT AS COARSELY WORDED AS FELL IN INTENT AS EVER WAS UTTERED
BUT THAT SOUNDED VERY FAR AWAY
I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY
OH SAID HE MORE LIGHTLY OUR YOUNG COUPLE WERE PLAYING SUCH FOOLISH PRANKS RUNNING ALL SORTS OF RISKS CLIMBING THIS MOUNTAIN SAILING ON THAT LAKE THAT I REALLY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED A MENTOR TO TAKE CARE OF THEM
I'D SET MY TEETH INTO MY TONGUE SOONER NOR SPEAK I HASTE
BUT SHE'S A DEAL ABOVE ME IN LEARNING NOW AND THE MOTHER SIGHED
BUT THE HANDS ACCEPT IT AS THEY DO MACHINERY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE INTENSE MENTAL LABOUR AND FORETHOUGHT REQUIRED TO BRING IT TO SUCH PERFECTION
BUT I AM SURE FOR ALL THAT IT IS THE DAMP AND RELAXING AIR MARGARET FELT AS IF A THIN COLD CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN HER AND THE SUN
SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS THE CARELESSNESS OF A SAILOR
BUT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NOT AGREEABLE JUST THEN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER DIXON NEVER NAMED THIS INTERVIEW THAT SHE HAD HAD WITH MR THORNTON TO MARGARET
SHE FORCED HER THOUGHTS INTO THE ACCUSTOMED HOUSEHOLD GROOVES
ON SECOND THOUGHTS WE'LL HAVE HER TO NURSE US TEN YEARS HENCE WHEN WE SHALL BE TWO CROSS OLD INVALIDS
WHY THORNTON
SO THOUGH SHE ALWAYS STOOD RATHER IN AWE OF MR THORNTON SHE WAS AS CURT AS SHE DURST BE IN TELLING HIM THAT HE COULD SEE NONE OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE LIKES ITALY HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT DIET DID HE IT WAS TO BE NOURISHING AND DIGESTIBLE
HALE IS DEAD FOR ALL THAT
THINK OF MAMMA
SHE SEEMED AGITATED AND RESTLESS
I CAME HERE VERY SAD AND RATHER TOO APT TO THINK MY OWN CAUSE FOR GRIEF WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD
IT WAS NOT THE BAD MANNERS OF IGNORANCE
THE DAY WOULD BE TOO SHORT TO COMFORT HER MOTHER
IN THIS MOOD HER FATHER CAME IN UNHEARD
IT WOULD BE LIKE MEAT WITHOUT SALT
THEN WE'LL GO UP-STAIRS AND SETTLE IT ALL MARGARET WAS IN A STATE OF ALMOST TREMBLING EAGERNESS WHILE MR BELL DISCUSSED HIS PLAN WITH HER AUNT SHAW WHO WAS FIRST STARTLED THEN DOUBTFUL AND PERPLEXED AND IN THE END YIELDING RATHER TO THE ROUGH FORCE OF MR BELL'S WORDS THAN TO HER OWN CONVICTION
NEVER MIND MARGARET
I DID NOT PROMISE
AND THEY LIVE IN A POPISH COUNTRY YES THEN I'M AFRAID I MUST SAY THAT MY SOUL IS DEARER TO ME THAN EVEN MASTER FREDERICK HIS OWN DEAR SELF
HE TELLS ME HE REPEATED TO YOU WHAT I SAID THIS MORNING ABOUT MR THORNTON HESITATED
MRS THORNTON--WHO HAD NOT SEEN HER FOR WEEKS--WAS SOFTENED ALL AT ONCE
HE WAS MORE IRRITATED THAN MARGARET HAD EVER KNOWN HIM AT HIS DAUGHTER'S EXPRESSED ANXIETY
AND M'APPEN I'LL FORGET THIS MARGARET READ IN HER SOFT LOW VOICE
SHE USED IT PERHAPS TOO VIOLENTLY IN HER OWN GREAT RELIEF
ARE THEY GONE ASKED SHE IN A WHISPER
HOW SHE COULD HAVE LOVED HIM IF HE HAD BUT BEEN DIFFERENT WITH A DIFFERENCE WHICH SHE FELT ON REFLECTION TO BE ONE THAT WENT LOW--DEEP DOWN
HITHERTO WE'VE STEERED CLEAR OF ALL VEXED QUESTIONS
YOU FALL--YOU HUNDREDS--ON ONE MAN
THAT'S HOW I KNOW THE CHAP THAT'S A MAN NOT A MEASTER
SHE SAYS LITTLE SUSAN HAS KEPT WATCH DOWN THE LANE FOR DAYS PAST.--NAY MARGARET WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE CHILD WATCHING FOR HER AND CONTINUALLY DISAPPOINTED--FROM NO FORGETFULNESS ON HER PART BUT FROM SHEER INABILITY TO LEAVE HOME--WAS THE LAST DROP IN POOR MARGARET'S CUP AND SHE WAS SOBBING AWAY AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK
MR HALE WAS RESOLVED TO SIT UP THROUGH THE NIGHT AND ALL THAT MARGARET COULD DO WAS TO PREVAIL UPON HIM TO REST ON THE DRAWING-ROOM SOFA
THAT LOOK OF LOVE CONTINUED HE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AS HE BOLTED HIMSELF INTO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM
HAMPER'S MEN ARE ACTUALLY OUT
HE HAD RESUMED HIS PIPE AND PUT HIS WELL IN THE FORM OF AN INTERROGATION
HE FELT IT DEEPLY I'M SURE WILLTO HOLD THY DIN AND LET ME HEAR THE LADY SPEAK ADDRESSING HERSELF IN NO VERY GENTLE VOICE TO A LITTLE URCHIN OF ABOUT A YEAR OLD
I'D A DEAL SOONER BE FLOGGED MYSEL
THEY'VE PICTURES IN THEM WHICH I SEE WHEN MY EYES ARE SHUT
THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT EITHER AND THEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT FROM WHAT DR DONALDSON HAD TOLD HIM MARGARET AT ANY RATE MUST BE AWARE OF THE EXACT STATE OF THE CASE
I DARE SAY I AM RESOLVING AGAINST THE VERY THINGS THAT HAVE GIVEN ME THE MOST TROUBLE JUST NOW NO I DON'T THINK YOU ARE
THIS IS THE SOLILOQUY OF ONE WHO WAS ONCE A CLERGYMAN IN A COUNTRY PARISH LIKE ME
YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY TELLING THE SIMPLE TRUTH THEN SEEING A SLIGHT HESITATION ON THE DOCTOR'S PART SHE ADDED I AM THE ONLY CHILD SHE HAS--HERE I MEAN
YOU TOLD MR THORNTON THAT I WAS NOT THERE OH OF COURSE MA'AM
GOOD NIGHT MA'AM GOOD NIGHT SHE RANG THE BELL FOR DIXON TO SHOW HIM OUT
AND I AM SO WORN OUT BY THE HEAT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE STRENGTH ENOUGH IN ME FOR ANOTHER DINNER
THE PROUD MOTHER'S WORLD WAS NOT THEIR WORLD OF HARLEY STREET GENTILITIES ON THE ONE HAND OR COUNTRY CLERGYMEN AND HAMPSHIRE SQUIRES ON THE OTHER
THAT SOUNDS AS IF YOU WERE FAR GONE IN THE WORSHIP OF THOR MARGARET FELT RATHER THAN SAW THAT MR THORNTON WAS CHAGRINED BY THE REPEATED TURNING INTO JEST OF WHAT HE WAS FEELING AS VERY SERIOUS
NOW AS TO FANNY SHE'D BE GIDDY AND NOT BOLD
AFTER BREAKFAST SHE RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO HER FATHER ABOUT THE FUNERAL
MR HALE WAS DISTRESSINGLY PERPLEXED
AS SHE FINISHED SPEAKING SHE LOOKED SO FAINT AND WEARY THAT MARGARET BECAME ALARMED
THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY THAT THE ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN WERE IDENTICAL WITH THE OTHER PAIR BUT THERE WAS GREAT PROBABILITY
I KNOW IT IS HIM--I CAN--I MUST MANAGE IT ALL MYSELF AS YOU PLEASE MISS SAID DIXON TESTILY
HER HEAD DROOPED FORWARDS--HER HANDS MEEKLY LAID ONE UPON THE OTHER--SHE TRIED TO RECALL THE FORCE OF HER TEMPTATION BY ENDEAVOURING TO REMEMBER THE DETAILS WHICH HAD THROWN HER INTO SUCH DEADLY FRIGHT
BUT BY-AND-BY CAME A RE-ACTION THERE WERE MORE FACTORIES MORE MASTERS
NOT ALL AT ONCE
THEY WERE QUITE BEYOND MY UNCLE'S MANAGEMENT AND KEPT THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN A PANIC FOR SIXTEEN HOURS OUT OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
BUT THEN REMEMBERING THAT IN THAT SLIGHTLY-BUILT HOUSE EVERY STEP WAS HEARD FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER SHE SATE DOWN UNTIL SHE HEARD MRS THORNTON GO SAFELY OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT OUR FACTORY WERE A GOOD ONE ON THE WHOLE
THEY CAME HYSTERICALLY
I RECKON I MAY BRING IT WI ME
I THOUGHT MRS THORNTON HAD BEEN MADE OF STERNER STUFF SHE WOULD PUT ON ANY ASSUMPTION OF FEELING TO VEIL HER DAUGHTER'S WEAKNESS SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE
CHAPTER XV MASTERS AND MEN THOUGHT FIGHTS WITH THOUGHT
BUT IN THE ONE OUTLET WHICH HE HAS FORMED FOR THE DEEPER AND BETTER FEELINGS OF HIS NATURE HE MEETS WITH REJECTION AND REPULSE
AT THE TIME HE HAD PUSHED HER ASIDE AND SPOKEN GRUFFLY
THE MORE WANTS FREDERICK HAD THE BETTER SHE WAS PLEASED
WHAT A PITY POOR OLD DIXON COULD NOT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE ME UP AND MAKE A PROVISION FOR HER OLD AGE OH FREDERICK HUSH
IF HE HAD COME HIMSELF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT BUT LETTERS ALWAYS WERE AND ALWAYS WILL BE MORE PUZZLING THAN THEY ARE WORTH
HE IS ONE MAN AND YOU ARE MANY
BUT THIS LOOK WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT
WHAT A SHAME THAT WE WERE NOT AT HOME TO RECEIVE YOU SAID EDITH
YES PAPA IT HAD BETTER BE FIXED SOON AND DECIDEDLY AS YOU SAY
YO SAID IT WERE ON TH TWENTY-FIRST
MR THORNTON HOWEVER KNEW NOTHING OF HER SORROW AND DRAWING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT WALKED OFF MUTTERING AS HE LEFT THE HOUSE A MORE PROUD DISAGREEABLE GIRL I NEVER SAW
DR DONALDSON'S APPOINTED VISIT WOULD BRING NERVOUS EXCITEMENT ENOUGH FOR THE EVENING
AND MASTER IS OUT VERY WELL I WILL COME SAID MARGARET QUIETLY
IF HE HAD CRIED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL
AN OPEN DAVENPORT STOOD IN THE WINDOW OPPOSITE THE DOOR
AHA MY MASTERS
BUT IT'S A COMFORT TO THEE POOR LASS POOR LASS
I SOMETIMES HAVE WONDERED WHERE JUSTICE WAS GONE TO AND NOW I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING IN THE WORLD,--NOW YOU ARE COME TO THIS
SHE FELT THAT IT WAS A GREAT WEIGHT SUDDENLY THROWN UPON HER SHOULDERS
IT WAS HER BROTHER SURE ENOUGH AND I RECKONED YO KNOWED IT OR I'D NEVER HA LET ON
BUT POOR FREDERICK HALE WAS NOT HERE THEN
AND I DON'T TAKE UP HIS CAUSE ONLY THOUGH HE'S A POOR GOOD-FOR-NOUGHT AS CAN ONLY MANAGE TWO LOOMS AT A TIME BUT I TAKE UP TH CAUSE O JUSTICE
OF COURSE SHE TOLD IT INCOMPLETELY
IT'S THAT MADE MY HEAD ACHE SO IN THE MILL
SHE COULD ONLY TRY TO COMFORT HER A LITTLE BY SUGGESTING THE VAGUE CHANCE OF THEIR MEETING AGAIN AT SOME POSSIBLE TIME IN SOME POSSIBLE PLACE AND BID HER TELL HER FATHER HOW MUCH SHE WISHED IF HE COULD MANAGE IT THAT HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS WORK IN THE EVENING
PARTICULARLY THE SECOND COURSE DEAR
DIXON SAT WITH MRS HALE WHILE SHE SLEPT
WE FOUND HIM I TH BROOK IN THE FIELD BEYOND THERE TH BROOK!--WHY THERE'S NOT WATER ENOUGH TO DROWN HIM HE WAS A DETERMINED CHAP
WELL I HAD REASON TO SUSPECT--TO IMAGINE--I HAD BETTER SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT HOWEVER
I SHOULD NOT MIND IF HE HAD A HOUSE OF HIS OWN
THEY RATHER MUST SEEK HIM OUT
WHILE HER EYE DID PASS OVER IT AND HER MEMORY COULD MECHANICALLY HAVE REPEATED IT WORD FOR WORD SHE HEARD HIM COME IN AT THE HALL-DOOR
WE ASKED NONE OF IT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
I AM LOSING HOPE SADLY ABOUT FREDERICK
TO URGE MARY TO COME TOO FOR HER HEART SMOTE HER AT THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE POOR AFFECTIONATE GIRL ALONE
I WISH YOU TO GO SAID HE AUTHORITATIVELY
SHE WAS SOOTHED WITHOUT KNOWING HOW OR WHY
MR BELL WHISTLED WITHOUT EMITTING ANY SOUND BEYOND A LONG HISSING BREATH
SO DON'T OFFEND ME BY TALKING OF BEING ABLE TO SPARE ME PAPA FOR I ASSURE YOU YOU CAN'T BUT THE IDEA OF A CHANGE TOOK ROOT AND GERMINATED IN MARGARET'S HEART ALTHOUGH NOT IN THE WAY IN WHICH HER FATHER PROPOSED IT AT FIRST
PERHAPS I MIGHT TAKE HER A LITTLE PRESERVE MADE OF OUR DEAR HELSTONE FRUIT
DON'T GO YET PLEASE MR BELL SAID SHE HASTILY
DON'T TELL ME IT IS FREDERICK--NOT FREDERICK
TO BE SURE HE NEEDS SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST WHICH GIVES THE TRUEST BASIS FOR CONJECTURE AS TO THE FUTURE
HER SISTER MARY WAS TYING ON HER BONNET IN GREAT CLUMSY BOWS AS SUITED HER GREAT CLUMSY FINGERS TO GO TO HER FUSTIAN-CUTTING BLUBBERING OUT LOUD THE WHILE AND EVIDENTLY LONGING TO BE AWAY FROM A SCENE THAT DISTRESSED HER
COME MARGARET MY DEAR
SOME DREAD MUST BE A TERRIBLE TORTURE TO HER FOR GOD'S SAKE JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER NOW REALLY SHOCKED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE WAS GLAD OF IT FOR THE SPEECH HAD SLIPPED FROM HIM UNAWARES--A RARE THING IN THE CASE OF A MAN WHO PREMEDITATED HIS ACTIONS SO MUCH AS HENRY LENNOX
THERE WERE THE YELLOW SEA-STAINED LETTERS WITH THE PECULIAR FRAGRANCE WHICH OCEAN LETTERS HAVE
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW SAID FANNY TO HERSELF
HE WAS ALREADY STANDING UP AND PREPARING TO GO
FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS SHE HEARD HER FATHER'S RESTLESS MOVEMENTS IN THE NEXT ROOM
I HARDLY KNOW AS YET HOW TO COMPARE ONE OF THESE HOUSES WITH OUR HELSTONE COTTAGES
AND NOW I HEAR HOW YOU HAVE HAD TO BEAR FOR YEARS AND THAT MAKES ME STRONGER BLESS YO
SOME PAINFUL RECOLLECTION HAD STOLEN ACROSS HIS MIND AND DRIVEN HIM INTO SILENCE
I SAY THEM TO MYSELF BUT THEY WOULD COME DIFFERENTLY FROM YOU REMEMBERING ALL THE CARES AND TRIALS YOU HAVE HAD TO BEAR I HAVE HAD A MANY SAID SHE SOBBING BUT NONE SO SORE AS THIS
HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD AND HID HIS FACE ONCE MORE IN HIS STRETCHED-OUT ARMS RESTING UPON THE TABLE AS HERETOFORE
HER DAUGHTER'S HANDS MIGHT BATHE HER FACE
THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING
THANKFULLY
AND I'LL BREAK STONES ON TH ROAD AFORE I LET THESE LITTLE UNS CLEM MARGARET PUT THE STRUGGLING JOHNNIE OUT OF HER ARMS BACK INTO HIS FORMER PLACE ON THE DRESSER
YOU TOO HENRY
THAT CHAP AS LIES THEER SAID HE WITH ANOTHER JERK
IT'S A STRAW-COLOUR
HE HAD NOT YET RESUMED THE INSTRUCTION TO HIS PUPILS WHICH HE HAD RELINQUISHED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS WIFE'S MORE SERIOUS ILLNESS SO HE HAD FEWER OCCUPATIONS THAN USUAL
I TELLED HER SHE WEREN'T TO MEDDLE AGAIN IN AUGHT THAT CONCERNED YO WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THOSE--YOURS MR THORNTON HAD A PRETTY GOOD NOTION WHOSE THEY WERE FROM WHAT HE HAD HEARD
SHE KNEW THEN HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY SHE HAD HAD TO BEAR FROM THE EXQUISITE SENSATION OF RELIEF WHICH SHE FELT IN FREDERICK'S PRESENCE
MY THEORY IS A SORT OF PARODY ON THE MAXIM OF GET MONEY MY SON HONESTLY IF YOU CAN
MARGARET STOOD PERFECTLY STILL THINKING SHE MIGHT BE YET WANTED AS A SORT OF BLOCK FOR THE SHAWLS
AND I TOO CHANGE PERPETUALLY--NOW THIS NOW THAT--NOW DISAPPOINTED AND PEEVISH BECAUSE ALL IS NOT EXACTLY AS I HAD PICTURED IT AND NOW SUDDENLY DISCOVERING THAT THE REALITY IS FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN I HAD IMAGINED IT
YOU'RE TOO WELL KNOWN HERE IF IT WERE SUMMER SAID HIGGINS I'D TAKE TO PADDY'S WORK AND GO AS A NAVVY OR HAYMAKING OR SUMMUT AND NE'ER SEE MILTON AGAIN
THAT ONLY COST FOURPENCE THAT WILL DO THANK YOU SAID MARGARET
TREAT HIM AS HER VASSAL INDEED
AND FOR SOME TIME WHENEVER THAT ESPECIAL DINNER RECURRED IN THEIR DIETARY I WAS SURE TO BE MET BY THESE MEN WITH A MASTER THERE'S HOT-POT FOR DINNER TO-DAY WIN YO COME IF THEY HAD NOT ASKED ME I WOULD NO MORE HAVE INTRUDED ON THEM THAN I'D HAVE GONE TO THE MESS AT THE BARRACKS WITHOUT INVITATION I SHOULD THINK YOU WERE RATHER A RESTRAINT ON YOUR HOSTS CONVERSATION
AND GOOD WORDS ARE ASKING FOR WORK
WHEREVER I FEEL WATER HEAVING UNDER A PLANK THERE I FEEL AT HOME
SPARE ME,--SPARE ME
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME LITTLE THING TO REMIND ME OF BESSY INSTANTLY MARY'S GENEROSITY WAS KEENLY ALIVE
BUT I KNOW NOW THAT YOU SPOKE TRUTH
THE SIGHT OF HIM REMINDED HER OF THE WISH TO SEE HIS MOTHER AND COMMEND MARGARET TO HER CARE
BESIDES MRS HALE HAD HAD HER VANITIES AS A GIRL
I DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ME BUT FOR MY BEING SUCH A FOOL AS TO CALL OUT HIS NAME
BECAUSE THAT IS A NATURAL PIOUS DUTY
I'M DREADFULLY AFRAID OF BEING TEMPTED AT AN UNGUARDED MOMENT BY THE AUNT NEITHER MR BELL NOR MR THORNTON WAS IN A LAUGHING HUMOUR
I WILL NOT--I WILL NOT THINK OF MYSELF AND MY OWN POSITION
I CAN'T THINK SAID SHE WITH GLOOMY DEFIANCE IN HER TONE HOW IT COMES ABOUT
IT IS NOT MERELY AN ARBITRARY DECISION OF THEIRS COME TO WITHOUT REASON YO'RE JUST A FOREIGNER AND NOTHING MORE SAID HE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
YOU CAN'T JUDGE BY WHAT IT IS NOW
YOU MUST SEND OUR BEST THANKS DIXON LEFT THE ROOM FOR A MOMENT
BUT IF YOU WENT I SHOULD PERSUADE MR THORNTON TO LET ME GIVE HIM DOUBLE LESSONS
HIS FATHER HAD MADE THE BLUNDER OF BRINGING HIM UP IN IGNORANCE AND TAKING IT FOR INNOCENCE
WHERE I COME FROM I NEVER HEARD OF A STRIKE I WISH I WERE THERE SAID BESSY WEARILY
HELSTONE ITSELF WAS IN THE DIM PAST
ONLY FROM TIME TO TIME HE UNCOVERED THE FACE AND STROKED IT GENTLY MAKING A KIND OF SOFT INARTICULATE NOISE LIKE THAT OF SOME MOTHER-ANIMAL CARESSING HER YOUNG
SHE CAUGHT HERSELF UP AT THIS WITH A MISERABLE TREMOR
I WILL PUT MY PLAID OVER IT AND IT WILL BE A REGULAR FOREST THRONE WITH YOUR FEET IN THAT PUDDLE FOR A REGAL FOOTSTOOL
I RECKON YO'N SOME WAY OF EARNING YOUR BREAD
I'LL NOT SPARE YOUR PURSE,--I KNOW IT'S DEEP ENOUGH
AND IT IS JUST POOR OLD ISAAC'S STIFF WAY OF STOOPING HIS LONG RHEUMATIC BACK
DO YOU MEAN THAT HE WOULD DENY ME THIS LAST WISH MARGARET
MORE SECURE IN FORTUNE AND FUTURE PROSPECTS THAN HE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN IN THE NAVY
IT'S A NEW REGULATION AT OURN
BUT REALLY INDIAN SHAWLS ARE VERY PERFECT THINGS OF THEIR KIND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE
YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED TO JUSTIFY YOURSELF AND WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHERE TO SEEK FOR PROOFS OF YOUR JUSTIFICATION
HE WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF THIS RIOT ABOUT THE DRUNKEN FELLOW'S DEATH
SHUT DOWN THAT WINDOW MISS HALE MARGARET SHUT DOWN HER WINDOW AND THEN WENT TO ASSIST MRS THORNTON'S TREMBLING FINGERS
BUT THE FACT OF THE WORLD ESTEEMING HER FATHER DEGRADED IN ITS ROUGH WHOLESALE JUDGMENT WOULD HAVE OPPRESSED AND IRRITATED MR LENNOX
THEN SIGHED
I MUST GO AND SEE HER
IT WAS WHAT MR THORNTON SAID HIMSELF THAT MADE US KNOW THE KIND OF MAN HE WAS
RUN MARGARET AND GATHER US SOME I PROPOSE THAT WE ADJOURN INTO THE GARDEN AND EAT THEM THERE SAID MR LENNOX
AND GLANCING AT MARGARET TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR SHE AGREED WITH HER FATHER HE SAW THAT NO DISSENTING SHADOW CROSSED HER FACE
AND IT HAS BEEN ON MY CONSCIENCE EVER SINCE THAT I GAVE HER PAIN WHICH A LITTLE MORE EXERTION ON MY PART MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED
SLICKSON'S MEN ARE OFF--PRETTY CERTAIN HE WON'T SPEND MONEY IN GETTING THEM PUNISHED
I'M AFRAID I MUST OWN THAT I THINK YOUR OPINIONS ARE THE OLDEST AND MUSTIEST I HAVE MET WITH THIS LONG TIME HEAR THIS DAUGHTER OF YOURS HALE
AS IT WAS HE LOOKED TO THE SPEEDY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT ALONE
WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HIM EXTERNAL TO HIS RELATION TO HER HE COULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN OF THAT TIME WHEN HE COULD HAVE SEEN HER EVERY DAY--WHEN HE HAD HER WITHIN HIS GRASP AS IT WERE--AS A TIME OF SUFFERING
WHAT STRONG FEELING HAD OVERTAKEN HER AT LAST
SHE PEERED ABOUT BEFORE VENTURING INTO THE BOOKING-OFFICE TO TAKE HER TICKET
ASSUMING HER RIGHTFUL POSITION AS DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE IN SOMETHING OF THE SPIRIT OF THE ELDER BROTHER WHICH QUELLED THE OLD SERVANT'S OFFICIOUSNESS VERY EFFECTUALLY
MR THORNTON STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE
HE WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY MR HALE
SHE NEVER WOULD CONCEAL ANYTHING SERIOUSLY AFFECTING HER HEALTH FROM ME
OH HOW LOW I AM FALLEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAY THAT OF ME
BUT MARGARET'S TALL FINELY MADE FIGURE IN THE BLACK SILK DRESS WHICH SHE WAS WEARING AS MOURNING FOR SOME DISTANT RELATIVE OF HER FATHER'S SET OFF THE LONG BEAUTIFUL FOLDS OF THE GORGEOUS SHAWLS THAT WOULD HAVE HALF-SMOTHERED EDITH
BUT WHEN THEIR EYES MET HIS WHOLE COUNTENANCE CHANGED
AND AFTER VARIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON PROPRIETY AND IMPROPRIETY IT WAS DECIDED THAT CAPTAIN LENNOX SHOULD ACCOMPANY MARGARET AS THE ONE THING TO WHICH SHE WAS CONSTANT WAS HER RESOLUTION TO GO ALONE OR OTHERWISE BY THE NEXT TRAIN WHATEVER MIGHT BE SAID OF THE PROPRIETY OR IMPROPRIETY OF THE STEP
BESSY LEANT BACK AGAINST HER FATHER WHO PREPARED TO CARRY HER UPSTAIRS
BUT WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED THE LAST AND WEIGHED THE PROS AND CONS THE LITTLE PERSONAL REVELATION OF CHARACTER CONTAINED IN THEM FORCED ITSELF ON HER NOTICE
WHY YOU'RE QUITE A YOUNG MAN MR HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT LITTLE HAND COULD HAVE GIVEN SUCH A SQUEEZE
OH MAMMA
OH MAMMA
IF YOU WOULD
THEY WERE GONE
BUT FATHER DOES THE LIKE I SEE
I WAS PUZZLED AT THE TIME
A REGULAR LONDON GIRL WOULD UNDERSTAND THE IMPLIED MEANING OF THAT SPEECH THOUGHT MR LENNOX
IT IS NO WONDER
I'LL NOT SAY TH ADVANTAGE IS ALL ON HIS SIDE FOR ALL I TAKE CREDIT FOR IMPROVING HIM ABOVE A BIT
WHAT WERE MR THORNTON'S ENGAGEMENTS
OF WHOSE CLEVERNESS IN HIS PROFESSION PEOPLE SPEAK VERY HIGHLY
HERE IF THEY HAD ANY LEISURE FROM CUSTOMERS THEY MADE THEMSELVES BUSINESS IN THE SHOP--EVEN MARGARET FANCIED TO THE UNNECESSARY UNROLLING AND REROLLING OF RIBBONS
THEY GAVE HER A TASTE OF THE FEELING THAT SHE BELIEVED WOULD BE DENIED TO HER FOR EVER
SHE ENJOYED THE THOUGHT OF SHOWING HERSELF UNTOUCHED BY THE GLAMOUR WHICH SHE WAS WELL AWARE MARGARET HAD THE POWER OF THROWING OVER MANY PEOPLE
I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR
I MUST SEE HIM AGAIN
E PAR CHE DE LA SUA LABBIA SI MOVA UNO SPIRTO SOAVE E PIEN D'AMORE CHI VA DICENDO A L'ANIMA
AS SHE WENT ALONG THE CROWDED NARROW STREETS SHE FELT HOW MUCH OF INTEREST THEY HAD GAINED BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF HER HAVING LEARNT TO CARE FOR A DWELLER IN THEM
BY SO DOING SHE MOLLIFIED HER ACCUSER
AND THOUGH OTHER PUPILS HAD TAKEN MORE THAN HIS PLACE AS TO TIME NO ONE WAS LIKE HIS FIRST SCHOLAR IN MR HALE'S HEART
WHY CAN'T HE GO TO OXFORD AND BE A TUTOR TO GENTLEMEN YOU FORGET MAMMA
SO I SPOKE TO MY FRIEND--OR MY ENEMY--THE MAN I TOLD YOU OF--AND HE FOUND FAULT WITH EVERY DETAIL OF MY PLAN
WHAT ARE YO LOOKING AT ME IN THAT WAY FOR ASKED HE AT LAST DAUNTED AND AWED BY HER SEVERE CALM
MY NIECE WILL RESIDE WITH ME IN HARLEY STREET
POOR FREDERICK
AND THE THOUGHT OF HER ABSENT FATHER RAN STRANGELY IN MARGARET'S HEAD THIS NIGHT
AND ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SECRETLY BLAMING HER HUSBAND FOR HAVING FALLEN INTO SUCH DREAR DESPAIR AND DENYING THAT HE HAD ANY EXCUSE FOR HIS LAST RASH ACT SHE WAS INVETERATE IN HER ABUSE OF ALL WHO COULD BY ANY POSSIBILITY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO SUCH DESPERATION
BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO RAISE
NOT TO-NIGHT THANK YOU AND MARGARET GRAVELY LIGHTED HER OUT OF THE ROOM AND BOLTED THE DOOR
HER FEATURES LIKE HER FRAME WERE STRONG AND MASSIVE RATHER THAN HEAVY
MR THORNTON WENT STRAIGHT AND CLEAR INTO ALL THE INTERESTS OF THE FOLLOWING DAY
HE WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE HE STOOD
SO THE ODDITY OF ANY OF THE SPEECHES WHICH THE FORMER MADE WAS UNNOTICED BY THEM
TELL ME WHAT HE WAS LIKE AS A BABY WHY MARGARET YOU MUST NOT BE HURT BUT HE WAS MUCH PRETTIER THAN YOU WERE
AND I'M NOT ONE WHO THINK TRUTH CAN BE SHAPED OUT IN WORDS ALL NEAT AND CLEAN AS TH MEN AT TH FOUNDRY CUT OUT SHEET-IRON
IT WAS THAT IN IT SHE HAD FOUND A HUMAN INTEREST
I WILL--YOU MIGHT--NO
THERE WAS NO PARTICULAR NEED TO TELL THEM THAT WHAT HE DID NOT CARE TO DO FOR A REVEREND MR HALE UNKNOWN IN MILTON HE WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO DO AT THE ONE SHORT SHARP REMONSTRANCE OF MR THORNTON THE WEALTHY MANUFACTURER
WHY IF I WERE A WORKMAN I SHOULD BE TWENTY TIMES MORE IMPRESSED BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MY MASTER WAS HONEST PUNCTUAL QUICK RESOLUTE IN ALL HIS DOINGS AND HANDS ARE KEENER SPIES EVEN THAN VALETS THAN BY ANY AMOUNT OF INTERFERENCE HOWEVER KINDLY MEANT WITH MY WAYS OF GOING ON OUT OF WORK-HOURS
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT MARGARET
THEY CAME PAST THE SPOT WHERE SHE AND MR LENNOX HAD SKETCHED
I'LL TRY AND CALL THERE THIS AFTERNOON
MR HALE NOW CAME IN
I'VE SPOKEN VERY WICKEDLY
SHE BEGAN TO WALK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN HER OLD HABITUAL WAY OF SHOWING AGITATION
BUT WHEN THEY STOPPED TO TALK SHE COULD NO MORE HAVE OPENED HER EYES OR SPOKEN TO ASK FOR MORE BATHING THAN THE PEOPLE WHO LIE IN DEATH-LIKE TRANCE CAN MOVE OR UTTER SOUND TO ARREST THE AWFUL PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR BURIAL WHILE THEY ARE YET FULLY AWARE NOT MERELY OF THE ACTIONS OF THOSE AROUND THEM BUT OF THE IDEA THAT IS THE MOTIVE FOR SUCH ACTIONS
I NE'ER HAVE SHOWN THOU NE'ER HAST KNOWN HOW DEAR THOU ART TO ME ANON
AS IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN ASLEEP
AND THE STUPID WRETCHES HERE WOULDN'T WORK FOR HIM
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME
AND YOU MUST LEARN TO LOOK UPON ME AS SUCH BECAUSE SEEING EACH OTHER--GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER AT SUCH TIMES AS THESE IS WORTH YEARS OF MORNING CALLS MARGARET COULD NOT SPEAK FOR CRYING
THEIR LURID VIVIDNESS OF EXISTENCE CAPTIVATED AND ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
RUN AWAY AND WASH THEM READY TO CUT BREAD-AND-BUTTER FOR ME AND LEAVE THE FIRE
IF THERE WAS ONE PLACE HE LOVED ON EARTH IT WAS HELSTONE
THEN MR LENNOX SAID ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO MARGARET I SUPPOSE AS MR BELL IS NOW ACQUAINTED WITH ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING YOUR BROTHER'S UNFORTUNATE DILEMMA I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN INFORM HIM EXACTLY HOW THE RESEARCH INTO THE EVIDENCE WE ONCE HOPED TO PRODUCE IN HIS FAVOUR STANDS AT PRESENT
AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE YOU MY OWN LAD WOULD NOT SHE SHE SET HER TEETH
IF HE HAD SAILED FOR SPAIN BY LIVERPOOL HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OFF IN TWO OR THREE HOURS
MANY A ONE WOULD SMILE TO HAVE SUCH A BONNY FACE THIS MAN LOOKED SO CAREWORN THAT MARGARET COULD NOT HELP GIVING HIM AN ANSWERING SMILE GLAD TO THINK THAT HER LOOKS SUCH AS THEY WERE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE POWER TO CALL UP A PLEASANT THOUGHT
ONE CANNOT HELP ADMIRING HIM WITH A MIXTURE OF PITY IN ONE'S ADMIRATION SOMETHING LIKE WHAT ONE FEELS FOR DON QUIXOTE
AND ON TUESDAY MARGARET WAS SURPRISED AND DISHEARTENED TO FIND THAT THERE WAS STILL NO LETTER
AND CAPTAIN LENNOX--I WONDER WHAT HE WILL DO WITH HIMSELF NOW HE HAS SOLD OUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SAID HER FATHER ANXIOUS TO INDULGE HER IN THIS FRESH SUBJECT OF INTEREST I THINK I MUST SPARE YOU FOR A FORTNIGHT JUST TO RUN UP TO TOWN AND SEE THE TRAVELLERS
I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO ADMIRE BUTCHERS AND BAKERS AND CANDLESTICK-MAKERS DO YOU MAMMA BUT THE GORMANS WERE NEITHER BUTCHERS NOR BAKERS BUT VERY RESPECTABLE COACH-BUILDERS VERY WELL
THERE WAS A PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
MARGARET WAS GLAD WHEN HER FILIAL DUTIES GENTLY AND CAREFULLY PERFORMED SHE COULD GO DOWN INTO THE STUDY
SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE
THE COMMON SOUNDS OF LIFE WERE MORE MUSICAL THERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THE LIGHT MORE GOLDEN THE LIFE MORE TRANQUIL AND FULL OF DREAMY DELIGHT
IT WAS RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE CONTRADICTED IN HER STATEMENT BY MR BELL'S OPENING THE STUDY-DOOR AND CALLING OUT
BUT THE WHISPERED TONE HAD LATTERLY BECOME MORE DROWSY
HERE WAS A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS TO HER FATHER
IT WOULD DO AUNT HALE GOOD AS I SAID BEFORE
SHE VENTURED OUT
I KNEW HE'D DO IT ALL LONG
GUESS WHO IS HERE HE LOOKED AT HER
MARGARET COULD NOT HELP COMPARING THIS STRANGE DRESSING OF HERS TO GO WHERE SHE DID NOT CARE TO BE--HER HEART HEAVY WITH VARIOUS ANXIETIES--WITH THE OLD MERRY GIRLISH TOILETTES THAT SHE AND EDITH HAD PERFORMED SCARCELY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO
IT WAS MARKED TOO LATE THE LETTER HAD PROBABLY BEEN TRUSTED TO SOME CARELESS WAITER WHO HAD FORGOTTEN TO POST IT
MARGARET IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK I CAN NEVER THANK THOSE WHO HAVE SHOWN YOU KINDNESS
THE WORKMEN'S CALCULATIONS WERE BASED LIKE TOO MANY OF THE MASTERS ON FALSE PREMISES
I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE VERY APT TO DO AS MY POOR FRIEND HALE DID MR BELL WAS INWARDLY CHAFING
IT WAS AN HEREDITARY POWER WHICH SHE HAD TO WALK IN AND TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS REGARD
OH PAPA I AM SORRY TO HAVE LOST YOU THIS FRIEND BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT--BUT OH
HER COUNTENANCE WAS BLANDER THAN USUAL AS SHE GREETED HER
BUT MARGARET SIGHED OVER THE OLD PICTURESQUENESS THE OLD GLOOM AND THE GRASSY WAYSIDE OF FORMER DAYS
AUNT SHAW SAYS SHE HAS SENT ME SOME CORAL ORNAMENTS PAPA
IT'S A LONG TIME AGO
BUT IT WAS ALL USED,--AND SHE HAD NO HEART TO SEND FOR ANY MORE JUST YET
SECONDLY SHE DID NOT LIKE BEING SO EASILY TAKEN AT HER WORD
THAT MORNING WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED OUT HER HEART HAD DANCED AT SEEING THE BRIGHT CLEAR LIGHTS ON THE CHURCH TOWER WHICH FORETOLD A FINE AND SUNNY DAY
THE INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED WAS VERY VAGUE
NOTICE THE F
FATHER WILL MAYBE HEAR YO HE'S DEAVED WI MY TALKING
IF I WERE A ROMAN CATHOLIC AND COULD DEADEN MY HEART STUN IT WITH SOME GREAT BLOW I MIGHT BECOME A NUN
AND THIS MAN COMES FROM MILTON
THEY WERE GRAND AND IMPOSING PLACES BUT IF TO GO THERE IT WAS NECESSARY TO LEAVE HELSTONE AS A HOME FOR EVER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SAD LONG LINGERING PAIN
THEN HE CALLED TO ONE OF THE WOMEN TO COME DOWN AND UNDO HIS OWN DOOR WHICH FANNY HAD FASTENED BEHIND HER IN HER MAD FLIGHT
HOWEVER I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT STRIKES AND RATE OF WAGES AND CAPITAL AND LABOUR THAT I HAD BETTER NOT TALK TO A POLITICAL ECONOMIST LIKE YOU NAY THE MORE REASON SAID HE EAGERLY
THEN HE READ ALOUD WHEN THOU CANST NO LONGER CONTINUE IN THY WORK WITHOUT DISHONOUR TO GOD DISCREDIT TO RELIGION FOREGOING THY INTEGRITY WOUNDING CONSCIENCE SPOILING THY PEACE AND HAZARDING THE LOSS OF THY SALVATION
MY DAUGHTER IS NO GREAT FRIEND OF MR THORNTON'S SAID MR HALE SMILING AT MARGARET
I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE TIME TO THINK AND I AM SURE EDITH WILL I AM NOT SO SURE ABOUT HER
EVERY ONE THEY SAW EITHER IN THE HOUSE OR OUT IN THE STREETS APPEARED HURRYING TO SOME APPOINTMENT EXPECTED BY OR EXPECTING SOMEBODY
NOT DEGRADED AND ABASED IN MR THORNTON'S SIGHT
AND THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL THAT IT WAS HARD TO TAKE HIM FROM ME FOR SUCH A LITTLE FAULT SOUTHEY
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS HAD SHE FELT PRODUCED SUCH GREAT CHANGES IN HERSELF THAT FORGETTING HOW MUCH OF THE ORIGINAL MARGARET WAS LEFT SHE HAD REASONED THAT IF HER TASTES AND FEELINGS HAD SO MATERIALLY ALTERED EVEN IN HER STAY-AT-HOME LIFE HIS WILD CAREER WITH WHICH SHE WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED MUST HAVE ALMOST SUBSTITUTED ANOTHER FREDERICK FOR THE TALL STRIPLING IN HIS MIDDY'S UNIFORM WHOM SHE REMEMBERED LOOKING UP TO WITH SUCH ADMIRING AWE
I SHALL CERTAINLY LET HER KNOW MY OPINION OF SUCH CONDUCT I DO NOT SEE ANY HARM IN WHAT SHE DID THAT EVENING SAID MR THORNTON GETTING UP AND COMING NEAR TO HIS MOTHER
THANK YOU BESSY FOR THINKING SO KINDLY ABOUT MY LOOKING NICE AMONG ALL THE SMART PEOPLE
MR THORNTON STOOD BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS WITH HIS BACK TO THE DOOR APPARENTLY ABSORBED IN WATCHING SOMETHING IN THE STREET
NICHOLAS HIGGINS WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE SMOKING AS SHE WENT IN
PINK AND BLUE ROSES WITH YELLOW LEAVES
AND WITH THE QUICK EYE OF A SKILLED LAWYER READY EVER TO TAKE IN AND WEIGH CONTINGENCIES HE HAD SEEN THAT MUCH ADDITIONAL VALUE WAS YEARLY ACCRUING TO THE LANDS AND TENEMENTS WHICH SHE OWNED IN THAT PROSPEROUS AND INCREASING TOWN
HE ONLY ASKED IF YOU LIVED HERE AND IF HE COULD SPEAK TO YOU
BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
HOO CANNOT LIVE LONG A THIS'N
HE WAS HAUNTED BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WITH WHOM SHE STOOD IN AN ATTITUDE OF SUCH FAMILIAR CONFIDENCE
SHE WENT TO THE SIDE-BOARD OPENED A DRAWER AND TOOK OUT A DUSTER WHICH SHE KEPT THERE FOR ANY OCCASIONAL PURPOSE
AND HE WAS ONLY KEPT BACK BY HER WANT OF FORTUNE
I DUNNO WHERE I GOT STRENGTH BUT I THREW MYSEL OFF TH SETTLE AND CLUNG TO HIM
YOU SEE MARGARET HOW FROM THE VERY FIRST HE DISLIKED CAPTAIN REID
AND FROM WHAT YOU SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THE MAN WAS OF A PASSIONATE DEMONSTRATIVE NATURE AND GAVE STRONG EXPRESSION TO ALL HE FELT OH PAPA WELL
HE AND DOLORES WROTE
BUT REALLY IT WAS SCARCELY HABITABLE WHEN WE CAME--FOR SO LARGE A FAMILY AS OURS I MEAN OF COURSE EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE WAS CHANGED BESIDES THE ONE OF WHICH MRS HEPWORTH SPOKE WHICH HAD BEEN MR HALE'S STUDY FORMERLY
I AM BETTER NOW
POOR LITTLE WOMAN
I HOPE YOU HAVE A WHITE WAND I WAS VERY SCRUPULOUS AT FIRST IN CONFINING MYSELF TO THE MERE PURCHASING PART AND EVEN IN THAT I RATHER OBEYED THE MEN'S ORDERS CONVEYED THROUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER THAN WENT BY MY OWN JUDGMENT
HE HAD SEEN HENRY LENNOX WHO KNEW ENOUGH OF THE CASE TO SHAKE HIS HEAD OVER IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND TELL HIM HE HAD DONE A VERY DARING THING IN RETURNING TO ENGLAND WITH SUCH AN ACCUSATION BACKED BY SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE HANGING OVER HIM
THE TOWN I MEAN
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG FROM MR BELL
IT'S NOTHING MISS SAID DIXON CHOKING A LITTLE
BUT MILTON MEN OUGHT TO HAVE THEIR THOUGHTS AND POWERS ABSORBED IN THE WORK OF TO-DAY
I AM QUITE SURE SHE WOULD NOT
THEY WERE THE FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCES OF THE HOUSE
HER STATELY BEAUTY WAS DIMMED WITH MUCH WATCHING AND WITH MANY TEARS
THE FIRST IDEA THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER WAS THAT ALL THIS SICKENING ALARM ON FREDERICK'S BEHALF WAS OVER
MR BELL SAID HE BEFORE YOU SPEAK SO YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT ALL MEN ARE NOT AS FREE TO EXPRESS WHAT THEY FEEL AS YOU ARE
DO YOU'--HE WAS GOING TO SAY--'LOVE ANY ONE ELSE BUT IT SEEMED AS IF THIS QUESTION WOULD BE AN INSULT TO THE PURE SERENITY OF THOSE EYES
I NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU BUT YOU GIVE ME A WELCOME I HOPE AS WELL AS THAT VERY PRETTY START OF SURPRISE HAVE YOU DINED
SHE FOUND OUT THAT THE WATER IN THE URN WAS COLD AND ORDERED UP THE GREAT KITCHEN TEA-KETTLE
SO DIXON FLUNG OFF TO BID HIM WALK UP-STAIRS
YOU DON'T LIKE STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING AS YOUR FATHER DOES DO YOU NO SAID SHE HEAVILY
I TRY TO THINK ONLY UPON THE PRESENT SHE PAUSED
DON'T TELL ME
NOT IN LOOK I GRANT YO BUT LET JOHN THORNTON GET HOLD ON A NOTION AND HE'LL STICK TO IT LIKE A BULLDOG
WHAT DOES SHE WISH
THE VERY MENTION OF HIS NAME RENEWED HER TROUBLE AND PRODUCED A RELAPSE INTO THE FEELING OF DEPRESSED PRE-OCCUPIED EXHAUSTION
HER HUSBAND MIGHT LIE BY HER SHAKING THE BED WITH HIS SOBS
GONE OUT TO DINNER
AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON HER CARES WERE ALL BLOWN AWAY AS LIGHTLY AS THISTLEDOWN AND SHE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE GLORIES OF THE FOREST
I RECKON YO'RE NOT WHAT FOLK WOULD CA PRETTY
YOU HAVE TAKEN SOME STEPS ABOUT THE RIOTERS I SUPPOSE
HOME SEEMED UNNATURALLY QUIET AFTER ALL THIS TERROR AND NOISY COMMOTION
THAT UGLY DREAM OF INSOLENT WORDS SPOKEN ABOUT HERSELF COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN--BUT COULD BE PUT ASIDE TILL SHE WAS STRONGER--FOR OH
SOME FOLK HAVE A GREAT WHEEL AT ONE END O THEIR CARDING-ROOMS TO MAKE A DRAUGHT AND CARRY OFF TH DUST
HOO'S JUST SINKING AWAY--NOT FOR WANT O MEAT HERSEL'--BUT BECAUSE HOO CANNOT STAND TH SIGHT O THE LITTLE ONES CLEMMING
YET IT IS PAIN TO THINK THAT PERHAPS I MAY NEVER SEE MY DARLING BOY AGAIN
AND YO'LL NOT WONDER IF I'M A BIT PUT OUT WI SEEING IT FAIL JUST FOR A FEW MEN WHO WOULD NA SUFFER IN SILENCE AND HOU'D OUT BRAVE AND FIRM YOU FORGET SAID MARGARET
ON THE RECEIPT OF HENRY LENNOX'S LETTER ANNOUNCING HOW LITTLE HOPE THERE WAS OF HIS EVER CLEARING HIMSELF AT A COURT-MARTIAL IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MISSING WITNESSES FREDERICK HAD WRITTEN TO MARGARET A PRETTY VEHEMENT LETTER CONTAINING HIS RENUNCIATION OF ENGLAND AS HIS COUNTRY
BUT ONE IS SURE TO HEAR THE NEWEST MUSIC THERE
AN INVOLUNTARY COMPARISON BETWEEN MR LENNOX AND MR THORNTON AROSE IN HER MIND
I DON'T WANT ANY SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE
HOW AM I TO DRESS UP IN MY FINERY AND GO OFF AND AWAY TO SMART PARTIES AFTER THE SORROW I HAVE SEEN TO-DAY EXCLAIMED MARGARET BURSTING THE BOUNDS SHE HAD PREORDAINED FOR HERSELF BEFORE SHE CAME IN AND TELLING HER MOTHER OF WHAT SHE HAD SEEN AND HEARD AT HIGGINS'S COTTAGE
STAY
IF HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING WHICH SHOULD MAKE YOU SOB SO HE KEEPS IT TO HIMSELF MARGARET'S FACE WAS STILL HIDDEN IN HER HANDS THE FINGERS OF WHICH WERE WET WITH TEARS
I KNOW FROM YOUR USING THE TERM IT IS ONE WHICH GIVES A TRUE IDEA OF THE REAL STATE OF THINGS TO YOUR MIND IT IS TRUE
I WANTED TO TELL YOU HOW GRIEVED I WAS TO FIND THAT I AM TO LOSE YOU AS A TENANT
BUT I AM AFRAID OF THIS LEONARDS
I AM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR COMING DID NOT I SAY THAT I SHOULD ASKED HE IN A LOWER TONE THAN THAT IN WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER I HEAR SIR
AND IF I GO I AM NOT SUCH A FINE LADY AS TO BE UNABLE TO TRAVEL WITHOUT YOU
I WAS QUITE SORRY WHEN MISS THORNTON CAME TO TAKE ME TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM SAYING SHE WAS SURE I SHOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE AT BEING THE ONLY LADY AMONG SO MANY GENTLEMEN
EVERY WORD AND ACTION CONNECTED WITH IT IS SO UNSPEAKABLY BITTER THAT I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF IT
IF SHE HAD STIRRED HAND OR FOOT HE WOULD HAVE THRUST HER ASIDE WITH EVEN MORE VIOLENCE THAN HE HAD USED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER WHOSE FACE WAS BLEEDING FROM HER FALL AGAINST A CHAIR
HE HAD A STRANGE PLEASURE IN MAKING HER WAIT
I COULD NOT SLEEP
IT IS ALL SETTLED AT ANY RATE
MARGARET GAVE UP TALKING ABOUT THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AT LAST
AND HAS PROPOSED TO GO OVER TO MILTON AND ASSIST YOU IN ANY SEARCH FOR THE WILL
THAT THEY'LL JUST GET CHEATED OUT OF AS SOON AS THEY'RE IN HIS POWER AGAIN
AT LAST DIXON FOUND WHAT SHE WANTED
I'SE HAVE TO BEGIN AND TRY NOW IF YO START MAKING AN ADO ABOUT WHAT LITTLE MARY COULD SARVE YO IS IT BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE YOU'RE OUT OF WORK ASKED MARGARET GENTLY
BUT STILL HE'S PRETTY POSITIVE THAT HE SAW MISS HALE AT THE STATION WALKING ABOUT WITH A GENTLEMAN NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME WHEN ONE OF THE PORTERS SAW A SCUFFLE WHICH HE SET DOWN TO SOME OF LEONARDS IMPUDENCE--BUT WHICH LED TO THE FALL WHICH CAUSED HIS DEATH
BUT IT'S GIBBERISH AND NOT TRUTH TO ME UNLESS I KNOW THE MEANING O THE WORDS
SHE MIGHT DROOP AND FLUSH AND FLUTTER TO HIS ARMS AS TO HER NATURAL HOME AND RESTING-PLACE
I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHANCE OF DYING AT MY POST SOONER THAN YIELD
OH BESSY I LOVED THE HOME WE HAVE LEFT SO DEARLY
I WILL BRING IT YOU IN A MINUTE
BUT IT IS NOT THEM--IT IS ME THEY WANT WHEN CAN THE SOLDIERS BE HERE ASKED HIS MOTHER IN A LOW BUT NOT UNSTEADY VOICE
OR MAPPEN YOUR FATHER WOULD BE BEST NO
HE HAD NO END IN THIS BUT THE PRESENT GRATIFICATION
I SUSPECT THEY TAKE IT OUT ON NON-HOT-POT DAYS WELL
I AM SURE I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR AND SO WILL THE VICAR BE MARGARET EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT HER FATHER AND STAMMERED OUT THE FACT OF HIS DEATH
AND WE WON'T
DON'T TAKE ANY STEPS TILL YOU HAVE SEEN ME AGAIN THE YOUNG LADY WILL EXPECT ME TO CALL FROM WHAT I SAID I ONLY WANT TO DELAY YOU AN HOUR
ON THE POINT OF EDUCATION ANY MAN WHO CAN READ AND WRITE STARTS FAIR WITH ME IN THE AMOUNT OF REALLY USEFUL KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD AT THAT TIME WELL
OR WHEN HE FOUND IT WAS LIKELY TO BRING HIM IN AS A WITNESS THEN IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A SCUFFLE ONLY A LITTLE LARKING AND LEONARDS MIGHT HAVE JUMPED OFF THE PLATFORM HIMSELF;--HE WOULD NOT STICK FIRM TO ANYTHING
AND THEY STILL SATE THERE WITH CLOSED DOORS
IT SEEMS THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED HAD A FANCY FOR BEING BURIED IN SOMETHING OF YOURS AND SO THE SISTER'S COME TO ASK FOR IT,--AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A NIGHT-CAP THAT WASN'T TOO GOOD TO GIVE AWAY OH
THEY WERE ALL IN TIME
IS THAT ALL
IS THAT ALL
NOW THAT I AM ABLE TO AFFORD MY MOTHER SUCH COMFORTS AS HER AGE RATHER THAN HER OWN WISH REQUIRES I THANK HER SILENTLY ON EACH OCCASION FOR THE EARLY TRAINING SHE GAVE ME
BUT THEY'RE SHARP UNS THEY ARE
THAT'S YO'R WAY OF BEING TRUE TO YO'R KIND
I CANNOT GO ALONE
DEAR MARGARET IF HE WOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPANY YOU AND AUNT HALE WE WILL TRY AND MAKE IT PLEASANT THOUGH I'M RATHER AFRAID OF ANY ONE WHO HAS DONE SOMETHING FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE
IT IS BAD TO BELIEVE YOU IN ERROR
IT FELL TO MARGARET'S SHARE TO HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR A SERVANT TO ASSIST DIXON WHO HAD AT FIRST UNDERTAKEN TO FIND JUST THE PERSON SHE WANTED TO DO ALL THE ROUGH WORK OF THE HOUSE
IF THERE IS ANYTHING IT IS ALL ON MR THORNTON'S SIDE
THE LOSS OF THEIR USUAL NATURAL HEALTHY COLOUR BEING MADE MORE EVIDENT BY THE HEAVY SHADOW OF THE DARK HAIR BROUGHT DOWN UPON THE TEMPLES TO HIDE ALL SIGN OF THE BLOW SHE HAD RECEIVED
BUT IT CANNOT LAST LONG NOW
AND THE OPPOSITION OF CHARACTER SHOWN IN ALL THESE DETAILS OF APPEARANCE SHE HAD JUST BEEN NOTICING SEEMED TO EXPLAIN THE ATTRACTION THEY EVIDENTLY FELT TOWARDS EACH OTHER
MR HALE WAS IN EXACTLY THAT STAGE OF APPREHENSION WHICH IN MEN OF HIS STAMP TAKES THE SHAPE OF WILFUL BLINDNESS
I HATE HER CHAPTER X WROUGHT IRON AND GOLD WE ARE THE TREES WHOM SHAKING FASTENS MORE GEORGE HERBERT
YET HE MUST JUST WORK ON THE SAME OR ELSE GO TO THE WORKHOUSE I THOUGHT YO WERE SO TAKEN WI THE WAYS OF THE SOUTH COUNTRY SO I AM SAID MARGARET SMILING A LITTLE AS SHE FOUND HERSELF THUS CAUGHT
AND IF SHE HAS TO PUT UP WITH A DIFFERENT STYLE OF LIVING WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH HER AIRS WHICH WILL BE WORSE
BELL
A VERY KIND FRIEND SAID MARGARET WHEN HER FATHER DID NOT ANSWER
YOU DON'T THINK I POISONED HIM
POOR MARIA SAID HE HALF SOLILOQUISING I WISH ONE COULD DO RIGHT WITHOUT SACRIFICING OTHERS
AND WORK'S WORK TO SUCH AS ME
AND MEN DIED OF THE WATERS BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE BITTER ONE CAN BEAR PAIN AND SORROW BETTER IF ONE THINKS IT HAS BEEN PROPHESIED LONG BEFORE FOR ONE
WAIT A MINUTE AND I WILL BRING YOU SOME POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS IT'S NOT A DEAD GOLD-COLOUR MA'AM
LISTEN
THERE WAS SOME SOFTENING IN HER HEART TOWARDS MARGARET NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY OUT OF HER SIGHT
MISS HALE I AM GLAD YOU DO ME JUSTICE
JOHNNY'S CRY WAS LOUDEST OF THEM ALL THOUGH HE KNEW NOT WHY HE CRIED POOR LITTLE FELLOW
BUT AT THE SOUND OF THE TENDER VOICES OF HER AUNT AND EDITH OF MERRY LITTLE SHOLTO'S GLEE AT HER ARRIVAL AND AT THE SIGHT OF THE WELL-LIGHTED ROOMS WITH THEIR MISTRESS PRETTY IN HER PALENESS AND HER EAGER SORROWFUL INTEREST MARGARET ROUSED HERSELF FROM HER HEAVY TRANCE OF ALMOST SUPERSTITIOUS HOPELESSNESS AND BEGAN TO FEEL THAT EVEN AROUND HER JOY AND GLADNESS MIGHT GATHER
THEY'RE NOT FIT FOR LADIES DIXON WAS STILL HUFFED ABOUT HER DESPISED TASTE
THROUGH ALL THESE DISFIGUREMENTS MARGARET RECOGNISED JOHN BOUCHER
THEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN--VERY DIFFERENTLY--NOT SO EXULTINGLY FAR MORE TENDERLY AND CAREFULLY
YES IN SPITE OF ALL HER PRESENT ANXIETIES THAT WAS THE LOOK ON HER FACE
HE HAD LAST SEEN MR THORNTON IN HIS FRIEND HALE'S COMPANY
THEN I COULD HAVE THE LITTLE BED-ROOM BEHIND IN THAT PROJECTION AT THE HEAD OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS--OVER THE KITCHEN YOU KNOW--AND YOU AND MAMMA THE ROOM BEHIND THE DRAWING-ROOM AND THAT CLOSET IN THE ROOF WILL MAKE YOU A SPLENDID DRESSING-ROOM BUT DIXON AND THE GIRL WE ARE TO HAVE TO HELP OH WAIT A MINUTE
YOU SAID BRAVE NOBLE TRUSTFUL WORDS THEN MOTHER WHICH I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE LAIN DORMANT
MY LIFE HAS BEEN TOO BUSY MY THOUGHTS TOO MUCH ABSORBED WITH OTHER THINGS
MUCH THE SAME KIND OF STRANGE PASSIONATE PLEASURE WHICH COMES STINGING THROUGH A MOTHER'S HEART WHEN HER DROOPING INFANT NESTLES CLOSE TO HER AND IS DEPENDENT UPON HER FOR EVERYTHING
AND MARGARET COULD CRY AT LEISURE AND BETHINK HER OF THIS FATAL YEAR AND ALL THE WOES IT HAD BROUGHT TO HER
NAY EVEN NOW HER ANXIETY TO HAVE HER CHARACTER FOR TRUTH PARTIALLY EXCUSED IN MR THORNTON'S EYES AS MR BELL HAD PROMISED TO DO WAS A VERY SMALL AND PETTY CONSIDERATION NOW THAT SHE WAS AFRESH TAUGHT BY DEATH WHAT LIFE SHOULD BE
AND FROM WHAT MARGARET COULD GATHER OF WHAT MR THORNTON HAD SAID THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE CESSATION OF HIS VISITS WHICH COULD ARISE FROM ANY UMBRAGE OR VEXATION
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF FINDING YOU JUST AFTER DINNER-TIME SAID MARGARET
HOO'S A BIT SET UP NOW BECAUSE HOO THINKS I MIGHT HA SPOKEN MORE CIVILLY
NO ONE COULD TELL BUT YOU MUST NOT GO SAID MRS THORNTON IMPATIENTLY
I WISH I COULD SHOW YOU OUR HIGH STREET--OUR RADCLIFFE SQUARE
SHE FRESHENS ME UP ABOVE A BIT
AND ESPECIALLY OF A PIECE WITH MARGARET
BUT IT IS A VERY SOFT AND PRETTY NAME HOW YOUNG SHE IS!--YOUNGER BY FOURTEEN MONTHS THAN I AM
LET HER GO
AND THEN HE LEFT THE HOT REEKING ROOM IN THE BOROUGH COURT AND WENT OUT INTO THE FRESHER BUT STILL SULTRY STREET
BUT THE TRUTH WAS MR THORNTON WAS HARD PRESSED
IT WAS NOT FAIR SAID SHE VEHEMENTLY THAT HE SHOULD STAND THERE--SHELTERED AWAITING THE SOLDIERS WHO MIGHT CATCH THOSE POOR MADDENED CREATURES AS IN A TRAP--WITHOUT AN EFFORT ON HIS PART TO BRING THEM TO REASON
IF IT'S ONLY THAT HE'S ILL AND LIKE TO DIE THEY MAY BRING HIM ROUND YET
WHAT A VAIN SHOW LIFE SEEMED
BUT IT'S IN FORCE NOW
ALL WERE AT WORK IN THE FACTORIES
IT TOOK A GREAT MORAL EFFORT TO GALVANISE HIS TRUST--EREWHILE SO PERFECT--IN MARGARET'S PURE AND EXQUISITE MAIDENLINESS INTO LIFE
AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE FOR SHE SHRANK FROM DEATH HERSELF WITH ALL THE CLINGING TO LIFE SO NATURAL TO THE YOUNG AND HEALTHY
OTHERS TOIL AND MOIL ALL THEIR LIVES LONG--AND THE VERY DOGS ARE NOT PITIFUL IN OUR DAYS AS THEY WERE IN THE DAYS OF LAZARUS
HE LOOKED UP AT HER DEFYINGLY
AND TOWARDS POST-TIME THE NEXT DAY PAPA SET OFF TO WALK TO SOUTHAMPTON TO GET THE PAPERS
SHE WAS AFRAID ALIKE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND OF WHAT SHE MIGHT HEAR
AND I'M GLAD MISS MARGARET WROTE OFF STRAIGHT WITHOUT SHILLY-SHALLYING
WHAT WERE YOU LAUGHING AT MARGARET ASKED SHE AS SOON AS SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM THE EXERTION OF SETTLING HERSELF ON THE SOFA
THESE LENNOXES SEEM VERY FOND OF YOU NOW
HOW WE SHALL KISS EACH OTHER SAID FREDERICK
IT NEVER ENTERED INTO HIS HEAD TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE BECAUSE OF THEIR RANK
BUT DON'T TALK SO--IT REALLY MAKES ME SORRY
WE WILL HOPE THAT MR LENNOX WILL MANAGE SO WELL THAT FREDERICK MAY BRING DOLORES TO SEE US WHEN THEY ARE MARRIED
LET ME BE IN THE FIRST PLACE MOTHER--I AM GREEDY OF THAT
LET US WALK ABOUT HERE ON THE PLATFORM SAID SHE A LITTLE FLURRIED AT THE IDEA OF SO SOON BEING LEFT ALONE AND HER BRAVERY OOZING OUT RATHER FASTER THAN SHE LIKED TO ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN TO HERSELF
I'M OUT O WORK BECAUSE I NE'ER ASKED FOR IT
THE EXACT TRUTH SAID HE
HE THOUGHT OF THAT LOOK THAT ATTITUDE!--HOW HE WOULD HAVE LAID HIS LIFE AT HER FEET FOR SUCH TENDER GLANCES SUCH FOND DETENTION
THERE WAS A PRETTY HUMILITY IN HER BEHAVIOUR TO HIM AS IF MUTELY APOLOGISING FOR THE OVER-STRONG WORDS WHICH WERE THE REACTION FROM THE DEEDS OF THE DAY OF THE RIOT
AND MARGARET FEELING IT RATHER THAN SEEING IT ROSE UP
FOR I SEE YOU PERSIST IN MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT I SAID THE OTHER DAY
HER MOTHER HAD ONLY WAKENED ONCE
AND MISS HALE WAS NOT SO BAD
YES HERE IT IS OH
WHERE IS MISS HALE ASKED HE AGAIN
GIVEN A STRONG FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE IN EVERY DARKSHIRE MAN HAVE I ANY RIGHT TO OBTRUDE MY VIEWS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHALL ACT UPON ANOTHER HATING IT AS I SHOULD DO MOST VEHEMENTLY MYSELF MERELY BECAUSE HE HAS LABOUR TO SELL AND I CAPITAL TO BUY NOT IN THE LEAST SAID MARGARET DETERMINED JUST TO SAY THIS ONE THING
NOT A WISH OF HIS THAT SHE DID NOT STRIVE TO FORECAST AND TO FULFIL
MARGARET SATE BEHIND THE CURTAIN THINKING
SHE WOULD NEVER RECOGNISE THEM AGAIN TILL THEY MET IN HEAVEN
HE'S A LAWYER AND THEY WERE IN PRETTY CONSTANT CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM
HIS PRESENCE AFTER THE WAY HE HAD SPOKEN--HIS BRINGING BEFORE HER THE DOOM WHICH SHE WAS VAINLY TRYING TO PERSUADE HERSELF MIGHT YET BE AVERTED FROM HER MOTHER--ALL CONSPIRED TO SET MARGARET'S TEETH ON EDGE AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND LISTENED TO HIM
FOR THE ONE THING CLEAR AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER WAS THE NECESSITY FOR LEAVING HELSTONE
YET HE KNEW ALL
MAMMA IS ACCUSING ME OF HAVING PICKED UP A GREAT DEAL OF VULGARITY SINCE WE CAME TO MILTON THE VULGARITY MARGARET SPOKE OF REFERRED PURELY TO THE USE OF LOCAL WORDS AND THE EXPRESSION AROSE OUT OF THE CONVERSATION THEY HAD JUST BEEN HOLDING
I TOLD HER YOU WOULDN'T I WILL GO DOWN AND SPEAK TO HER SAID MARGARET AFRAID LEST DIXON'S HARSHNESS OF MANNER MIGHT WOUND THE POOR GIRL
THE CHINTZ HAD BEEN OFTEN WASHED
HERE'S THIS BOY OF MINE MARGARET,--IF YOU DON'T PACK UP YOUR THINGS AS SOON AS YOU GET THIS LETTER A COME STRAIGHT OFF TO SEE HIM I SHALL THINK YOU'RE DESCENDED FROM KING HEROD MARGARET DID LONG FOR A DAY OF EDITH'S LIFE--HER FREEDOM FROM CARE HER CHEERFUL HOME HER SUNNY SKIES
BUT WHAT ABOUT IT MARGARET I WANT TO TELL YOU OF SOMETHING I DID THAT WAS VERY WRONG ABOUT THAT TIME SAID MARGARET SUDDENLY LOOKING UP AT HIM WITH HER CLEAR HONEST EYES
I WAS LIKE MAMMA'S LITTLE DOG TINY WITH AN ELEPHANT'S TRAPPINGS ON
I THINK A BIRD I TH HAND IS WORTH TWO I TH BUSH
OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT SECRET AND PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT HAVE NAMED IT NOW SAID MARGARET A LITTLE DISMAYED
MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU IS--SIMPLY THAT OF A FRIEND
FLUFF REPEATED BESSY
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
THE DWELLER IN TOWNS MUST FIND IT AS DIFFICULT TO BE PATIENT AND CALM AS THE COUNTRY-BRED MAN MUST FIND IT TO BE ACTIVE AND EQUAL TO UNWONTED EMERGENCIES
SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AND WAS SO ABSORBED IN HER OWN GRIEF THAT SHE DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT THE CROWD ATTRACTED ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS DISPERSING TILL SHE WAS SPOKEN TO BY SOME ONE CLOSE AT HAND
HIS STIFF FEATURES RELAXED INTO A SLOW SMILE AS MARGARET WENT UP AND SPOKE TO HIM
DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE-BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES
AND I'VE BEEN VERY BUSY
AND I COME FRO BURNLEY-WAYS AND FORTY MILE TO TH NORTH
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DETAILS SO DON'T GIVE THEM ME THE ONLY DETAIL I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS TO LET US HAVE THE BACK DRAWING-ROOM UNDISTURBED AS IT WAS TO-DAY
GOING TO BREAK TO HALE'S DAUGHTER THE NEWS OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH DEATH
I SUPPOSE EACH MODE OF LIFE PRODUCES ITS OWN TRIALS AND ITS OWN TEMPTATIONS
SHE HAD A FIERCE PLEASURE IN THE IDEA OF TELLING MARGARET UNWELCOME TRUTHS IN THE SHAPE OF PERFORMANCE OF DUTY
DID I DO WRONG MR HALE DID NOT REPLY AT FIRST
BUT ADDED MARGARET HALF SMILING SHE'S AFRAID THE MILTON DISSENTERS WON'T APPRECIATE THEM
THE SAUCY JADE
MOTHER WITH A SHORT SCORNFUL LAUGH YOU WILL MAKE ME CONFESS
MR HALE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR BELL IN WHICH THAT GENTLEMAN VOLUNTEERED A VISIT TO THEM
LONDON
THIS I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE THIS TO MR THORNTON AFTER I AM GONE
HE SEEMED A SHARP INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND IN GOOD PRACTICE TOO TO JUDGE FROM THE SIGNS OF BUSINESS AND THE NUMBER OF CLERKS ABOUT HIM
IF HE CAME AND STOOD HIS TRIAL WHAT WOULD BE THE PUNISHMENT
IT MISSED ITS AIM AND SHE TURNED SICK WITH AFFRIGHT BUT CHANGED NOT HER POSITION ONLY HID HER FACE ON MR THORNTON S ARM
SHE CARED NOT TO THINK EVEN TO HERSELF OF HOW MUCH OF EXCUSE SHE MIGHT PLEAD
NOT YET I SEE--THERE IS NO HURRY--BUT SOME TIME SHE WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TRYING TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AS IT WAS IN HER OWN HEART BEFORE REPLYING
ONE OF THE GREAT PLEASURES OF MARGARET'S LIFE AT THIS TIME WAS IN EDITH'S BOY
BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT ASKED SHE OF HERSELF
I AM SO AFRAID SHE DOES NOT TELL ME ALWAYS WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE GAVE WAY ALL AT ONCE
IF MRS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MRS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER
THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN DISMAY
IT MIGHT BE--IT PROBABLY WAS--A STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN REID'S IMPERIOUSNESS IN TRIFLES VERY MUCH EXAGGERATED BY THE NARRATOR WHO HAD WRITTEN IT WHILE FRESH AND WARM FROM THE SCENE OF ALTERCATION
AND EDITH PEEPED OUT OF THE DRAWING-ROOM
I'M SORRY MISS HALE YOU HAVE VISITED US AT THIS UNFORTUNATE MOMENT WHEN I FEAR YOU MAY BE INVOLVED IN WHATEVER RISK WE HAVE TO BEAR
BUT IF SUCCESSFUL PLACING ME HIGH ABOVE WATER-MARK SO THAT NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW THE STRAIT I AM IN
LET THEM YELL SAID HE
HER SON'S PRESENCE NEVER GAVE ANY IMPRESSION AS TO THE KIND OF HOUSE HE LIVED IN
BESEKING HYM LOWLY OF MERCY AND PITE OF ITS RUDE MAKYNG TO HAVE COMPASSION CHAPTER I HASTE TO THE WEDDING WOOED AND MARRIED AND A EDITH SAID MARGARET GENTLY EDITH BUT AS MARGARET HALF SUSPECTED EDITH HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
THERE IS LESS RISK OF HIS BEING SEEN
WHAT KIND OF REASON THE ONLY REASON THAT DOES WITH MEN THAT MAKE THEMSELVES INTO WILD BEASTS
TH WOMEN ARE AS BAD AS TH MEN IN THEIR SAVAGENESS THIS TIME
AND THEN THERE'LL BE AN ADO BECAUSE IT'S NOT GINGER BEER BUT I CAN'T HELP IT
MRS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING
HE HOPED TO COME AND PAY THEM A VISIT SOON IF THEY WOULD HAVE HIM
SHE FORCED HERSELF TO RECOLLECT ALL THE CONVERSATION THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM
I THOUGHT I SHOULD NA HA SEEN YO AGAIN SAID SHE AT LAST LOOKING WISTFULLY IN MARGARET'S FACE
AND BY THE TIME SHE WENT UP TO DRESS SHE COULD THANK GOD FOR HAVING SPARED HER DEAR OLD FRIEND A LONG OR A PAINFUL ILLNESS
THINK OF IT
OUT OF HER FRIGHT CAME A FLASH OF INDIGNATION WHICH MADE HER FACE SCARLET AND HER DARK EYES GATHER FLAME AS SHE HEARD SOME OF THEIR SPEECHES
HE IS LETTING US DOWN GENTLY BUT I CAN SEE THAT MR LENNOX HIMSELF HAS NO HOPE OF HUNTING UP THE WITNESSES UNDER YEARS AND YEARS OF TIME
THERE WAS SO SLIGHT AN ALLUSION TO THEIR ALARM AT THE RAIL-ROAD STATION THAT MR HALE PASSED OVER IT WITHOUT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO IT
BUT IN ANSWER TO SOME ENQUIRY OF HERS AS TO HIS HEALTH HE SENT HER A SHORT NOTE SAYING THERE WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED COMPLAINT CALLED THE SPLEEN
I SOME PLACES THEM'S FINED WHO SPEAKS TO HIM
I WONDER HOW SHE'LL SIN
SHE CUT HIS SPEECH RATHER SHORT BY SAYING
BUT IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST I'VE A VERY NICE PINK GAUZE WHICH AUNT SHAW GAVE ME ONLY TWO OR THREE MONTHS BEFORE EDITH WAS MARRIED
IT HAD SEEMED TO HER THEN THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO WILL AND SUCH A LIFE WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED
THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE QUICK BRISK LOUD-TALKING KIND-HEARTED AND NOT TROUBLED WITH MUCH DELICACY OF PERCEPTION
SHE AND I KNOWS EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL
THERE WAS NO COMFORT TO BE GIVEN
THAT WILL NEVER BE EDITH SO GIVE UP THINKING ABOUT IT BUT IT WOULD BE SO NICE FOR US ALL PLEADED EDITH
HE WAS SHOWN UP INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM WHERE MR HALE WAS READING ALOUD TO HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER
THOUGH OF COURSE IF YOUR FATHER LEAVES THE CHURCH WE SHALL NOT BE ADMITTED INTO SOCIETY ANYWHERE
A MINUTE MORE AND HE WOULD BE GONE
MARY SAT DOWN ON THE FIRST CHAIR SHE CAME TO AND THROWING HER APRON OVER HER HEAD BEGAN TO CRY
AND IT IS A GREAT ART MILTON PEOPLE I SUSPECT THINK OXFORD MEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO MOVE
AND I WAS GETTING TO UNDERSTAND HER
THE NEW VICAR IS A TEETOTALLER MISS AND A MAGISTRATE AND HIS WIFE HAS A DEAL OF RECEIPTS FOR ECONOMICAL COOKING AND IS FOR MAKING BREAD WITHOUT YEAST
HE REGRETTED IT I AM SURE
I SHALL SPEAK TO HER AS I WOULD DO TO FANNY IF SHE HAD GONE GALLIVANTING WITH A YOUNG MAN IN THE DUSK
MR HALE IS MY FRIEND I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO FOR IF SHE HAD BEEN YOUR FRIEND WHAT BETSY SAYS WOULD HAVE ANNOYED YOU LET ME HEAR IT SAID HE WITH THE EXTREME QUIETNESS OF MANNER HE HAD BEEN ASSUMING FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
MY BROTHER JOHN GOES TO HIM TWICE A WEEK AND SO HE BEGGED MAMMA TO ASK THEM HERE IN HOPES OF GETTING HIM KNOWN
I WENT TO SEE WIDOW MALTBY
I THINK WE COULD NO SAID MR HALE
LET ME GO TO HER HALF AN HOUR AGO MR HALE WAS A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
AND SHE QUIETED HERSELF TO LISTEN
NOTHING SAID SHE RISING UP QUICKLY AND SPEAKING AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
STILL IT MADE HER UNEASY,--AS THE PRESENCE OF ALL STRONG FEELING OF WHICH THE CAUSE IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD OR SYMPATHISED IN ALWAYS HAS THIS EFFECT
BUT IN HALF AN HOUR I SHALL BE READY TO DO THE SAME OVER AGAIN
BUT I KNOW WHO HE IS
SARAH WHAT ASKED FANNY SHARPLY
MR BELL WENT ON AH
SO THOUGH HE DISLIKES THE PLACE--TOO BUSTLING FOR ONE OF HIS HABITS--HE IS OBLIGED TO KEEP UP SOME SORT OF CONNECTION
NICHOLAS WAS OUT
BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE-MOTHER YOU HAVE CAUGHT HER
THEY ALWAYS HAVE IT IN THEIR MINDS AND EVERY FIVE OR SIX YEARS THERE COMES A STRUGGLE BETWEEN MASTERS AND MEN
IN SPITE OF THE ONE STEP'S ENOUGH FOR ME,'--IN SPITE OF THE ONE PLAIN DUTY OF DEVOTION TO HER FATHER,--THERE LAY AT HER HEART AN ANXIETY AND A PANG OF SORROW
FOR AS SHE SAID SHE SAW NO USE IN MAKING UP FRIENDSHIPS AND INTIMACIES WITH ALL THE TEACHERS AND MASTERS IN MILTON
SHE FELL ASLEEP HOPING FOR SOME BRIGHTNESS EITHER INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL
HE DID NOT GET UP WHEN HE SAW THEM THOUGH MARGARET COULD READ THE WELCOME IN HIS EYE
HOME SAID MARGARET VERY SOFTLY
EVEN AFTER HER MOTHER WENT TO BED HE WAS NOT CONTENT TO BE ABSENT FROM HER BUT UNDERTOOK TO READ HER TO SLEEP
SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL HER LIFE
TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID
FOR DROPPING HER VOICE THEY DO SAY THAT BOUCHER THREW A STONE AT THORNTON'S SISTER THAT WELLY KILLED HER THAT'S NOT TRUE SAID MARGARET
I LIKE YOU TWENTY TIMES BETTER THAN HAMLET ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT A LIVING ASS IS BETTER THAN A DEAD LION PERHAPS SO
YO'R VERY FACE,--LOOKING WI YO'R CLEAR STEADFAST EYES OUT O TH DARKNESS WI YO'R HAIR BLOWN OFF FROM YO'R BROW AND GOING OUT LIKE RAYS ROUND YO'R FOREHEAD WHICH WAS JUST AS SMOOTH AND AS STRAIGHT AS IT IS NOW,--AND YO ALWAYS CAME TO GIVE ME STRENGTH WHICH I SEEMED TO GATHER OUT O YO'R DEEP COMFORTING EYES,--AND YO WERE DREST IN SHINING RAIMENT--JUST AS YO'R GOING TO BE DREST
SHE HAD THEN SOME HOPE TO LOOK TO SO BRIGHT THAT EVEN IN HER AFFECTIONATE NATURE IT COULD COME IN TO LIGHTEN THE DARK HOURS OF A DAUGHTER NEWLY MADE MOTHERLESS
MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
IS SHE ALIVE YES SHE IS ALIVE DEAR DEAR BROTHER
AND MR HENRY LENNOX AND THE SPRINKLING OF RISING MEN WHO WERE RECEIVED AS HIS FRIENDS BROUGHT THE WIT THE CLEVERNESS THE KEEN AND EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH THEY KNEW WELL ENOUGH HOW TO AVAIL THEMSELVES WITHOUT SEEMING PEDANTIC OR BURDENING THE RAPID FLOW OF CONVERSATION
THE DEAD STAND BETWEEN YO AND EVERY ANGRY WORD O MINE
MR BELL WAS PERPLEXED
MARGARET HESITATED BEFORE SHE REPLIED
ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED LIKE SOME PRISONER FALSELY ACCUSED OF A CRIME THAT SHE LOATHED AND DESPISED AND FROM WHICH SHE WAS TOO INDIGNANT TO JUSTIFY HERSELF
SHE BEGAN HURRIEDLY
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD COME TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT THE FALSEHOOD SHE HAD TOLD--THAT MR THORNTON HAD EMPLOYED HER TO EXPLAIN THE DANGER SHE HAD EXPOSED HERSELF TO OF BEING CONFUTED IN FULL COURT
HER HEART WAS WONDERFULLY LIGHTER AS SHE WENT UP-STAIRS
WELL YOU SHALL TRY
EXCEPT IN THE ONE GRAND CASE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX'S OFFER EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK
I HEARD A GOOD DEAL OF HIS PREVIOUS LIFE FROM MR BELL BEFORE WE CAME HERE
AND SHE HAD BEEN VERY MEEK AND PATIENT TILL ALL AT ONCE HER FAITH HAD GIVEN WAY AND SHE HAD GROPED IN VAIN FOR HELP
BUT SHE COULD BEAR IT PATIENTLY BECAUSE SHE KNEW HER FATHER'S PURITY OF PURPOSE AND THAT STRENGTHENED HER TO ENDURE HIS ERRORS GRAVE AND SERIOUS THOUGH IN HER ESTIMATION THEY WERE
SHE HAD COME IN SO GENTLY THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD HER
MR HALE DEAD AY
I'LL NEVER SPEAK DISRESPECTFUL OF A MAN IN THE SAME FIX AS I'M IN MYSEL BUT I'LL JUST AX YO ANOTHER QUESTION SIR AND I DUNNOT WANT YO TO ANSWER IT ONLY TO PUT IN YO'R PIPE AND SMOKE IT AFORE YO GO FOR TO SET DOWN US WHO ONLY BELIEVE IN WHAT WE SEE AS FOOLS AND NODDIES
AND SHE MAY BE WAITING ME
IT WAS THE ONLY MOTION VISIBLE ON HER COUNTENANCE
BUT I WOULD NOT IF I COULD
BLOT YOUR MISDEEDS OUT IF YOU ARE PARTICULARLY CONSCIENTIOUS BY A GOOD DEED AS SOON AS YOU CAN
DUNNOT ASK ME
MAY I ASK FOR A CAB YOU ARE QUITE FLUSHED AND FEVERISH OBSERVED MR LOWE
AND SO ALL I HAVE IS AT HER SERVICE IF SHE NEEDS IT
IT IS ONLY A FAINTING-FIT
YOU MUST NOT MENTION IT
BUT THOU'ST BEEN A BLESSIN TO THY FATHER EVER SIN THOU WERT BORN
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL TRUNK OF A TREE WHICH THE WOOD-CUTTERS HAVE LEFT JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THE LIGHT
HE TOO SHE KNEW WOULD STRIVE TO FORGET HER BECAUSE OF THE PAIN SHE HAD CAUSED HIM
ALL MEN MUST DIE SAID HE AT LAST WITH A STRANGE SORT OF GRAVITY WHICH FIRST SUGGESTED TO MARGARET THE IDEA THAT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING--NOT ENOUGH TO INTOXICATE HIMSELF BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE HIS THOUGHTS BEWILDERED
THE VERY SERVANTS LIVED IN AN UNDERGROUND WORLD OF THEIR OWN OF WHICH SHE KNEW NEITHER THE HOPES NOR THE FEARS
BUT NOW HAD COME ONE OF THOSE PERIODS OF BAD TRADE WHEN THE MARKET FALLING BROUGHT DOWN THE VALUE OF ALL LARGE STOCKS
I OUGHT TO THANK YOU SIR
SHE IS SADLY GRIEVED AT NOT HAVING WISHED YOU GOOD-BYE
IT NEEDED MORE--MORE THAT COULD NOT BE HAD
AND TO FEEL SURE THAT HOWEVER THEY MIGHT HENCEFORWARD KEEP SILENCE ON ALL THESE ANXIETIES THEY YET UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS AND WERE IF NOT IN HARMONY AT LEAST NOT IN DISCORD WITH EACH OTHER IN THEIR WAY OF VIEWING THEM
IT IS A GOOD DEAL FOR ME TO SAY SAID MRS THORNTON SMILING SLOWLY WHILE THE TEARS STOOD IN HER EYES
A MAN IN THE DRESS OF A RAILWAY PORTER STARTED FORWARD
I WOULD NOT GIVE YOU A PENNY SHE SAID SMILING
NICHOLAS SAID MARGARET
MARGARET ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE HER FATHER AND MOTHER STILL SAT HOLDING LOW CONVERSATION TOGETHER LOOKING VERY PALE AND WHITE
HER SHAME WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE DISPERSION OF THE GUESTS
I SHALL BE OUT OF TEMPTATION FOR NO ONE WILL ASK ME
YOU MUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE OR IT MAY BE ONLY SOMEONE OF THE WORKPEOPLE SPEAK AS THOUGH IT WERE THE INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYERS TO KEEP THEM FROM ACQUIRING MONEY--THAT IT WOULD MAKE THEM TOO INDEPENDENT IF THEY HAD A SUM IN THE SAVINGS BANK I DARE SAY IT WAS THAT MAN HIGGINS WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS SAID MRS HALE
I DO NOT FEEL THAT MY VERY NATURAL LIKING FOR THE PLACE WHERE I WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP,--AND WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN MY RESIDENCE FOR SOME YEARS REQUIRES ANY ACCOUNTING FOR MARGARET WAS VEXED
AND THEN WE SAW A REPORT IN THE PAPERS--THAT'S TO SAY LONG BEFORE FRED'S LETTER REACHED US--OF AN ATROCIOUS MUTINY HAVING BROKEN OUT ON BOARD THE RUSSELL AND THAT THE MUTINEERS HAD REMAINED IN POSSESSION OF THE SHIP WHICH HAD GONE OFF IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PIRATE
IF YO SIR OR ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGABLE PATIENT MAN COME TO ME AND SAYS HE'LL LARN ME WHAT THE WORDS MEAN AND NOT BLOW ME UP IF I'M A BIT STUPID OR FORGET HOW ONE THING HANGS ON ANOTHER--WHY IN TIME I MAY GET TO SEE THE TRUTH OF IT
ONLY TO PLEASE ME DARLING DON'T GO AND HAVE A STRONG MIND
DO MARGARET PLEASE RING THE BELL FOR HANLEY BUT MARGARET ALMOST LIKED HIM BETTER IN THESE MANIFESTATIONS OF CHARACTER THAN IN HIS GOOD BLUE-SASHED MOODS
WHAT ABOUT HIM WHY SIR HIS DEATH IS ODDLY MIXED UP WITH SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE I SAW YOU COMING OUT OF JUST NOW
MR HALE SPOKE FIRST IN CONTINUATION OF HIS THOUGHT
I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE TO BARGAIN WITH HIM
HOW COULD HE HAVE LULLED HIMSELF INTO THE UNSUSPICIOUS CALM IN WHICH HER TEARFUL IMAGE HAD MIRRORED ITSELF NOT TWO HOURS BEFORE TILL HE HAD WEAKLY PITIED HER AND YEARNED TOWARDS HER AND FORGOTTEN THE SAVAGE DISTRUSTFUL JEALOUSY WITH WHICH THE SIGHT OF HER--AND THAT UNKNOWN TO HIM--AT SUCH AN HOUR--IN SUCH A PLACE--HAD INSPIRED HIM
BUT SHE HARDLY SPOKE AGAIN
ARE YOU SURE IT WILL FIT
AFTER ALL IT IS RIGHT SAID SHE HEARING THE VOICES OF CHILDREN AT PLAY WHILE SHE WAS DRESSING
IT DOESNA LOOK LIKE HIM
HER HEAD DROPPED A LITTLE TOWARDS HER CHEST
HE COULD REMEMBER ALL ABOUT IT NOW
BUT I SUPPOSE MRS THORNTON ASSISTS YOU IN YOUR MARKETING NOT A BIT REPLIED MR THORNTON
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE DOWN AGAIN AND TRY NOT TO THINK
DIXON WILL KEEP THE DOOR LIKE A DRAGON--WON'T YOU DIXON--WHILE HE IS HERE THEY'LL BE CLEVER IF THEY COME IN PAST ME SAID DIXON SHOWING HER TEETH AT THE BARE IDEA
BESSY SAID TO HER THE TWENTY-FIRST--THAT'S THURSDAY WEEK
WE'N GETTEN MONEY LAID BY
THE BISHOP WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT
HE WILL THINK IT SO STRANGE IF YOU DON'T MRS HALE TOOK OFF HER BLACK SILK APRON AND SMOOTHED HER FACE
WHO'S THERE
LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE CHANGED INSTANTLY
INDEED WHEN I ONCE SAW HOW UNFIT THEY WERE TO BE TRUSTED ALONE I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY NOT TO LEAVE THEM TILL I HAD SEEN THEM SAFELY EMBARKED AT PLYMOUTH HAVE YOU BEEN AT PLYMOUTH
NOW PLEASE JUST STOP HERE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SAID MARGARET
THEY DROVE UP TO THE LENNARD ARMS
HAMPER HAS HAD A LOSS OF YOU
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS ANY HIDDEN COMPLAINT
AGAIN SHE TOOK HER PLACE BY THE FARTHEST WINDOW
WHAT IS THIS HANGING FROM THE BRANCH OF THE TREE
AND BENT FORWARDS TO HEAR
AND HAD REPENTED HIM OF HIS MORNING'S DECISION
AS HE WAS SILENT THEY CAUGHT A SWELL IN THE SOUND OF CONVERSATION GOING ON NEAR THE FIRE-PLACE BETWEEN MR COLTHURST AND MR THORNTON
AND WHISPERED-PANTED OUT THE WORDS TAKE CARE.--IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK--I SHALL CLAIM YOU AS MY OWN IN SOME STRANGE PRESUMPTUOUS WAY.--SEND ME AWAY AT ONCE IF I MUST GO;--MARGARET AT THAT THIRD CALL SHE TURNED HER FACE STILL COVERED WITH HER SMALL WHITE HANDS TOWARDS HIM AND LAID IT ON HIS SHOULDER HIDING IT EVEN THERE
WHERE WERE THOSE WHO SPOKE TO HIM MOVED AROUND HIM TOUCHED HIM NOT AN INSTANT AGO
BUT ON CONSIDERATION SHE SAW RATHER IN SUCH EXPRESSION THE POIGNANCY OF THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HAD THUS CRUSHED HIS HOPES
THEN SHE ASKED
NO DOUBT THERE IS MANY A MAN HERE WHO WOULD BE THANKFUL IF HIS PROPERTY WOULD INCREASE AS YOURS HAS DONE WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT SAID MR HALE
I HAVE SPARED NO EXPENSE IN HER TROUSSEAU WERE THE NEXT WORDS MARGARET HEARD
THE CHURCH-CLOCK STRUCK HALF-PAST SEVEN AS HE STOOD AT THE DOOR AWAITING DIXON'S SLOW MOVEMENTS
NOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF FREDERICK CLAIMED HER FREDERICK EXCLAIMED MR THORNTON
AND PRESENTLY MARGARET RACKING HER BRAIN TO TALK TO FANNY HEARD HER MOTHER AND MRS THORNTON PLUNGE INTO THE INTERMINABLE SUBJECT OF SERVANTS
LET HER KNOW THE WORST
WHEN THE FIRE WAS BRIGHT AND CRACKLING--WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR BREAKFAST AND THE TEA-KETTLE WAS SINGING AWAY MARGARET GAVE A LAST LOOK ROUND THE ROOM BEFORE GOING TO SUMMON MR HALE AND FREDERICK
WE'SE NOT FRIENDS WHY NOT ASKED MARGARET WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN THE PEACEMAKER OF THE VILLAGE
I WAS NOT AT THE RAILWAY STATION THAT NIGHT
POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING
AND THEN THIS FALSEHOOD--HOW TERRIBLE MUST BE SOME DREAD OF SHAME TO BE REVEALED--FOR AFTER ALL THE PROVOCATION GIVEN BY SUCH A MAN AS LEONARDS WAS WHEN EXCITED BY DRINKING MIGHT IN ALL PROBABILITY BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ONE WHO CAME FORWARD TO STATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OPENLY AND WITHOUT RESERVE
OF COURSE IT IS UNKNOWN IN THE FASHIONABLE CIRCLES SHE CONTINUED SCORNFULLY
AND PAPA AND MAMMA DON'T CARE MUCH ABOUT IT
TO HEAR HER FATHER TALKED OF IN THIS WAY BY A SERVANT TO HER FACE
HE WAS VERY LATE--MUCH LATER THAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
THEN SHE SIGHED AND PUTTING DOWN HER SPOON SHE BEGAN APROPOS OF NOTHING AT ALL AND IN THE HIGH-PITCHED VOICE WHICH USUALLY SHOWS THAT THE SPEAKER HAS BEEN THINKING FOR SOME TIME ON THE SUBJECT THAT THEY WISH TO INTRODUCE--'MR BELL YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE SAYING ABOUT FREDERICK LAST NIGHT DON'T YOU LAST NIGHT
THE FORETHOUGHT OF MANY ANXIOUS HOURS WAS THROWN AWAY UTTERLY WASTED BY THEIR INSANE FOLLY WHICH WOULD INJURE THEMSELVES EVEN MORE THAN HIM THOUGH NO ONE COULD SET ANY LIMIT TO THE MISCHIEF THEY WERE DOING
AND BOOKS NOT CARED FOR ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BINDING SOLELY LAY ON ONE TABLE AS IF RECENTLY PUT DOWN
MY MOTHER AND MY GRANDMOTHER BEFORE ME SENT GOOD MALT LIQUOR TO HAYMAKERS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHAN'T THINK UNLESS YOU SPEAK
HE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HER ACKNOWLEDGING GLANCE AND A SILENT RECOGNITION WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM WHENEVER THE CHANCES OF THE DAY BROUGHT THEM ACROSS EACH OTHER'S PATHS
WHILE HERE WE'N RUCKS O MONEY COMING IN ONE QUARTER AND NE'ER A FARTHING TH NEXT
HE DID NOT SPEAK BUT HE KEPT HIS PLACE
DIXON WILL BE FLATTERED IF WE ASK HER TO MAKE SOME
HE LIGHTED HIS OWN MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
SHE SANK BACK INTO THE CHAIR
MARGARET WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HER LOOK SO CALM
I DO IT FOR MR HALE
HE SET HIS TEETH AS HE HEARD HER WORDS
THEN HE SUDDENLY LET GO HIS HOLD OF MARGARET AND THROWING HIS BODY HALF ACROSS THE TABLE HE SHOOK IT AND EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE IN THE ROOM WITH HIS VIOLENT SOBS
PERHAPS YOU WOULD GO MARGARET DEAR MARGARET WENT UP INTO THE OLD NURSERY AT THE VERY TOP OF THE HOUSE WHERE NEWTON WAS BUSY GETTING UP SOME LACES WHICH WERE REQUIRED FOR THE WEDDING
I VALUE MY OWN INDEPENDENCE SO HIGHLY THAT I CAN FANCY NO DEGRADATION GREATER THAN THAT OF HAVING ANOTHER MAN PERPETUALLY DIRECTING AND ADVISING AND LECTURING ME OR EVEN PLANNING TOO CLOSELY IN ANY WAY ABOUT MY ACTIONS
I COULD NOT LEAVE PAPA AND MAMMA WELL
MARGARET ONLY WANTED TO KNOW IF SHE MUST STAY IN TO RECEIVE THIS CALL AS IT WOULD PREVENT HER GOING TO SEE HOW BESSY WAS UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY SINCE THE EARLY MORNING WAS ALWAYS OCCUPIED IN HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS
IT IS THAT HE MAY LEARN HOW I WAS TEMPTED AND HOW I FELL INTO THE SNARE
YOU MUST NOT WONDER AT MY IGNORANCE
THERE WAS NO SET OF STRANGERS ONLY ONE SITTING FAR FROM HIM ON THE SAME SIDE
AND I REMEMBER AT THE TIME I AGREED WITH HIM IT WAS A LONG WHILE BEFORE HE SPOKE
WHEN THIS LITTLE PIECE OF BUSINESS WAS ENDED SHE FELL INTO A REVERIE
BUT HE SATE BY THE BED QUITE QUIETLY
AY SAID THE WOMAN SHAKING HER HEAD HE LOVED US A WE HAD SOME ONE TO LOVE US ONCE
THAT MAN WAS HERE WHEN I CAME HOME AND I HAVE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THEN WE MUST TAKE ANYTHING WE CAN GET
I'M NOT A FOOL
HE NEVER DID
AND I SUPPOSE I WAS NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE TOLD PLAINLY ABOUT IT
AND TO DIE WITHOUT KNOWING ONE GOOD PIECE O REJOICING IN ALL HER DAYS
WHATEVER OPINION--HOWEVER CHANGED IT MIGHT BE FROM WHAT MR THORNTON HAD ONCE ENTERTAINED SHE HAD WISHED IT TO BE BASED UPON A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE
JUST AS MARGARET HAD EXHAUSTED HER LAST SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION--AND YET CONVERSATION THAT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED WHICH CONSISTED OF SO FEW AND SUCH SHORT SPEECHES--HER FATHER CAME IN AND WITH HIS PLEASANT GENTLEMANLY COURTEOUSNESS OF APOLOGY REINSTATED HIS NAME AND FAMILY IN MR THORNTON'S GOOD OPINION
M'APPEN I SHAN'T LISTEN TO TH SENSE AT FIRST
HER SON SHARED THIS FEELING
BUT I'LL SEE ABOUT HER BEING SAFE OFF AS SOON AS WE KNOW WHEN HE COMES GOD BLESS HIM
HE WAS CLIMBING UP SOME TREE OF FABULOUS HEIGHT TO REACH THE BRANCH WHEREON WAS SLUNG HER BONNET
NO ANSWER
LOOKING OUT OF MYSELF AND MY OWN PAINFUL SENSE OF CHANGE THE PROGRESS ALL AROUND ME IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY
A HUNDRED IS LEFT
MANY'S THE TIME I'VE LONGED TO WALK IT OFF--THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HER AND HOW IT MUST ALL END OH DIXON SAID MARGARET HOW OFTEN I'VE BEEN CROSS WITH YOU NOT KNOWING WHAT A TERRIBLE SECRET YOU HAD TO BEAR BLESS YOU CHILD
YO KNOW WELL THAT A WORSER TYRANT THAN E'ER TH MASTERS WERE SAYS CLEM TO DEATH AND SEE EM A CLEM TO DEATH ERE YO DARE GO AGAIN TH UNION YO KNOW IT WELL NICHOLAS FOR A YO'RE ONE ON EM
HER FATHER AND DIXON WOULD FAIN HAVE PERSUADED MARGARET TO GO TO BED
NO I AM SURE YOU ARE WRONG
THEY DON'T BELIEVE I THE BIBLE,--NOT THEY
THE VERY FALSEHOOD THAT STAINED HER WAS A PROOF HOW BLINDLY SHE LOVED ANOTHER--THIS DARK SLIGHT ELEGANT HANDSOME MAN--WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS ROUGH AND STERN AND STRONGLY MADE
POOR LITTLE FELLOW SAID MARGARET SLOWLY
MR HALE HAD HIS OWN ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THE WORKING MEN AND WAS DEPRESSED WITH THEIR EARNESTLY TOLD TALES OF SUFFERING AND LONG-ENDURANCE
MARGARET WOULD NOT TELL ANY HUMAN BEING OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND SHE DID NOT REVEAL THE FATAL TERMINATION TO LEONARDS FALL FROM THE PLATFORM
AND NOW I MUST GO AND TELL THEM THEY WON'T BE WANTED HE ACCORDINGLY PRESENTED HIMSELF AGAIN AT MR HALE'S THAT EVENING
MARGARET'S FACE DIMPLED UP INTO A MERRY LAUGH
HE WAS VERY KIND AND SAID HE WOULD CALL AGAIN AND SEE HOW HIS MEDICINES WORKED ONLY CARE--HE DID NOT RECOMMEND CHANGE OF AIR?--HE DID NOT SAY THIS SMOKY TOWN WAS DOING HER ANY HARM DID HE MARGARET NO
BUT SO IT WAS
NOR DID IT CLEAR AWAY WHEN MR THORNTON ENTERED THE ROOM
I CAN'T LEAVE HER
HE'S HIS FATHER'S DARLING HE IS SAID SHE WITH A SUDDEN TURN OF MOOD AND DRAGGING THE CHILD UP TO HER KNEE SHE BEGAN KISSING IT FONDLY
MARGARET REMAINED ALONE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
BLESS HER SAID DIXON
AS I SAID TO MISSUS WHAT WOULD POOR SIR JOHN HAVE SAID
LOOK WELL INTO THE CARRIAGE BEFORE YOU GET IN THEY WENT BACK TO THE STATION
AND NOW SHE HAD LEARNT THAT NOT ONLY TO WILL BUT ALSO TO PRAY WAS A NECESSARY CONDITION IN THE TRULY HEROIC
YES I DO BELIEVE YOU
IF IT SUCCEEDED I SHOULD BE A RICH MAN AND MY PEACE OF CONSCIENCE WOULD BE GONE WHY
NOTHING IS SO DELICIOUS AS TO SET ONE'S TEETH INTO THE CRISP JUICY FRUIT WARM AND SCENTED BY THE SUN
THE LIE HAD BEEN SO DESPICABLY FOOLISH SEEN BY THE LIGHT OF THE ENSUING EVENTS AND FAITH IN THE POWER OF TRUTH SO INFINITELY THE GREATER WISDOM
IT BROKE IN UPON HIS LATELY ACQUIRED HABIT OF SITTING STILL IN ONE EASY CHAIR FOR HALF A DAY TOGETHER
WE WERE SO AFRAID OF GIVING YOU PAIN
WHEN HAD HE SEEN HIM
IF A WISH COULD HAVE TRANSPORTED HER SHE WOULD HAVE GONE OFF
BESIDES SHE SAYS AND VERY JUSTLY THAT SHE HAS FRIENDS SHE MUST SEE--THAT SHE MUST WISH GOOD-BYE TO SEVERAL PEOPLE
THERE WAS A VERY ANIMATED CONVERSATION GOING ON AMONG THE GENTLEMEN
WHEN ALL ARE ADMITTED HOW CAN THERE BE A HOLY OF HOLIES
BESIDES THERE IS NOT SUCH ANOTHER FACTORY IN MILTON
I KNOW I HAVE NOT THAT MUCH
I BEG YOUR PARDON MA'AM BUT MY DUTY OBLIGES ME TO ASK YOU A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS
BUT IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE THE BRIGHTNESS CAME HER HEART WOULD HAVE SUNK LOW DOWN
EVEN NOW WHILE SHE WALKED SADLY THROUGH THAT DAMP AND DREAR GARDEN IN THE DUSK WITH EVERYTHING FALLING AND FADING AND TURNING TO DECAY AROUND HER HE MIGHT BE GLADLY PUTTING AWAY HIS LAW-BOOKS AFTER A DAY OF SATISFACTORY TOIL AND FRESHENING HIMSELF UP AS HE HAD TOLD HER HE OFTEN DID BY A RUN IN THE TEMPLE GARDENS TAKING IN THE WHILE THE GRAND INARTICULATE MIGHTY ROAR OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSY MEN NIGH AT HAND BUT NOT SEEN AND CATCHING EVER AT HIS QUICK TURNS GLIMPSES OF THE LIGHTS OF THE CITY COMING UP OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF THE RIVER
MR HALE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MEETING EVER SINCE THEY HAD PARTED
I TOLD THEM MY NEXT NEIGHBOURS I MEAN FOR I'M NO SPEECH-MAKER HOW MUCH I'D ENJOYED IT
ASK MR BELL SAID HE IN A HOLLOW VOICE
I LIKE TO HEAR SPEAK OF THE COUNTRY AND TREES AND SUCH LIKE THINGS SHE LEANT BACK AND SHUT HER EYE AND CROSSED HER HANDS OVER HER BREAST LYING AT PERFECT REST AS IF TO RECEIVE ALL THE IDEAS MARGARET COULD SUGGEST
SHE WAS GONE TO THE PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
IT SEEMED TO HER SO SACRILEGIOUS TO BE PEERING INTO THAT POOR DISTORTED AGONISED FACE THAT BY A FLASH OF INSTINCT SHE WENT FORWARDS AND SOFTLY COVERED THE DEAD MAN'S COUNTENANCE WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF
AND THAT THE WITHHOLDING WOULD BE TORTURE MORE ACUTE THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF IT
HE WENT TO BED WELL TO ALL APPEARANCE LAST NIGHT AND WAS QUITE COLD THIS MORNING WHEN MY SERVANT WENT TO CALL HIM WHERE
WE WILL GO THIS WAY AND MAKE A ROUND SO AS TO COME BACK BY IT REPLIED MARGARET
THE IDEA OF HER DISTRESS TURNS ME SICK WITH DREAD
EVEN THE PRETTY LAWN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS MADE UNSIGHTLY AND UNTIDY BY THE STRAW THAT HAD BEEN WAFTED UPON IT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND WINDOWS
INDEED I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS SO VERY MUCH OF A HURT
IT IS QUITE AS NEAR AND NOT SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT
I HAVE CREDIT IN CADIZ SAID HE BUT NONE HERE OWING TO THIS WRETCHED CHANGE OF NAME
I MIGHT HEAR MORE THAN YOU'D LIKE I'D TAKE TH RISK
THOSE HOURS BY THE SEA-SIDE WERE NOT LOST AS ANY ONE MIGHT HAVE SEEN WHO HAD HAD THE PERCEPTION TO READ OR THE CARE TO UNDERSTAND THE LOOK THAT MARGARET'S FACE WAS GRADUALLY ACQUIRING
THE ROUND LINES IN HER FACE TOOK A LENGTHENED STRAIGHTER FORM AND HER WHOLE APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF ONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH A DAY OF GREAT FATIGUE
THAT VERY MAN HAS IT WITHIN HIM TO MOUNT STEP BY STEP ON EACH WONDER HE ACHIEVES TO HIGHER MARVELS STILL
THEY SLOWLY DILATED INTO MOURNFUL REPROACHFUL SADNESS
SHE WERE NEVER TIRED O TALKING O YO SHE USED TO SAY YO WERE THE PRETTIEST THING SHE'D EVER CLAPPED EYES ON
AND SHE SAID WITH A GREAT BURST OF CRYING SHE SHOULD BE GLAD ENOUGH TO GO FROM A PLACE WHERE SHE HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH
A BLEAK BACK-GROUND OF TREES SOME WHITE LINEN HUNG OUT ON THE SWEET-BRIAR HEDGE AND A GREAT WAFT OF DAMP AIR
DID YO SEE HER DIE NO REPLIED MARGARET STANDING STILL WITH THE UTMOST PATIENCE NOW SHE FOUND HERSELF PERCEIVED
HOU'D UP MAN
THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN HERE IN THE SPRING--IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS LONG AGO AS LAST WINTER--WHO TOLD US A DEAL OF MR HALE AND MISS MARGARET
AND D'YE THINK I'LL TAKE YOU ON
IT WAS A JOY SNATCHED IN THE HOUSE OF MOURNING AND THE ZEST OF IT WAS ALL THE MORE PUNGENT BECAUSE THEY KNEW IN THE DEPTHS OF THEIR HEARTS WHAT IRREMEDIABLE SORROW AWAITED THEM
AND I DID SO ENJOY THEM
ALONG WI IT COME CRIMES
THEY'VE GOT IMMENSE PLATE-GLASS WINDOWS LARGER THAN CRAWFORD'S IN SOUTHAMPTON
HITHERTO THEY HAD BEEN VOICELESS WORDLESS NEEDING ALL THEIR BREATH FOR THEIR HARD-LABOURING EFFORTS TO BREAK DOWN THE GATES
IT SURELY MUST BE NEAR BEDTIME NOT FAR OFF--IT IS HALF-PAST NINE
SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO TRY AND GATHER STRENGTH FOR SOMETHING MORE YET TO BE SAID
I BELIEVE--OH PAPA I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU AND SHE DROPPED HER WORK AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
WILD PASSIONATE CRY SUCCEEDED TO CRY--'FREDERICK
DIXON CAME IN A HUFF AND ACCUSED MARGARET OF HAVING OVER-EXCITED HER MOTHER
HE COULD NOT FORGET THE TOUCH OF HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK IMPATIENTLY FELT AS IT HAD BEEN AT THE TIME
IF IN HER COOLER MOMENTS SHE MIGHT NOT APPROVE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN ALL THINGS STILL THERE WAS MUCH TO ADMIRE IN THEIR FORGETFULNESS OF THEMSELVES AND THE PRESENT IN THEIR ANTICIPATED TRIUMPHS OVER ALL INANIMATE MATTER AT SOME FUTURE TIME WHICH NONE OF THEM SHOULD LIVE TO SEE
BUT THEN SHE WAS WEAK DIZZY AND TIRED
THERE WAS NO GREAT VARIETY IN HER COUNTENANCE
HE PUT UP HIS BOOK OF NOTES IN A VERY DELIBERATE MANNER
WE DO NOT LOOK FOR REASON OR LOGIC IN THE PASSIONATE ENTREATIES OF THOSE WHO ARE SICK UNTO DEATH
WHEREAS IF MR HALE WOULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED BEHIND HIM HE WOULD HAVE SEEN BISCUITS AND MARMALADE AND WHAT NOT ALL ARRANGED IN FORMAL ORDER ON THE SIDEBOARD
FOR HIS SAKE TOO,--OUR POOR POOR BOY HER FATHER DID NOT CHANGE HIS ATTITUDE BUT HE SEEMED TO BE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FACT
HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES AT THE HOUSE ASKING FOR NEWS OF MISS MARGARET--THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER DID ASK EXCEPT ONCE MR THORNTON
NAY SAID HE I WILL ASK NO FARTHER
BUT I WON'T LOSE ANOTHER MOMENT OF MY OWN DEAR PRECIOUS MOTHER SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
SHE MADE A STRONG EFFORT TO BE CALM
MR HALE TOOK HOLD OF HER SWEET PLEADING FACE IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND KISSED HER FOREHEAD
AND THERE ARE DEEDS AND LEASES TO BE LOOKED OVER AND AGREEMENTS TO BE DRAWN UP
HENCEFORWARD SHE MUST FEEL HUMILIATED AND DISGRACED IN HIS SIGHT
I HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONVICTION THAT NO MERE INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER WISE AND HOWEVER MUCH THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO ORGANISE AND ARRANGE THEM CAN ATTACH CLASS TO CLASS AS THEY SHOULD BE ATTACHED UNLESS THE WORKING OUT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS BRING THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES INTO ACTUAL PERSONAL CONTACT
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER INTENTLY FOR A MINUTE
TH OU'D PARSON WOULD HA FRETTED HIS WOMAN'S HEART OUT IF HE'D SEEN THE WOEFUL LOOKS I HAVE SEEN ON OUR MEASTER'S FACE THOUGHT HIGGINS ONE DAY AS HE WAS APPROACHING MR THORNTON IN MARLBOROUGH STREET
WE NEITHER OF US CAN THINK MUCH WORSE OF THE OTHER THAN WE DO NOW THAT'S TRUE SAID HIGGINS REFLECTIVELY
WHILE MR BELL RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT IN SECRET BY CONSIDERING MR THORNTON ABOUT AS BRUSQUE AND CURT A FELLOW AS HE HAD EVER MET WITH AND TERRIBLY GONE OFF BOTH IN INTELLIGENCE AND MANNER
THEY WERE HUNG AT THE YARD-ARM SAID MRS HALE SOLEMNLY
HE THOUGHT HE WAS OVERSTOCKED
HE WAS A GOOD MAN MRS PURKIS AND THERE'S MANY OF US THAT MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HAVE AS CALM AN END AS HIS
HOW MUCH SHE MUST HAVE BORNE
HE'S NOT SATISFIED WI THE MAKE OF IT AND WANTS FOR T EXAMINE EM WHAT ARE THEY'--BEGAN MR HALE
ABOUT THIS TIME DIXON RETURNED FROM MILTON AND ASSUMED HER POST AS MARGARET'S MAID
BUT IT WAS A TRUISM A PHANTOM AND BROKE DOWN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HER REGRET
KNOWING ALL THE WHILE WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE OF COURSE BUT THINKING HE'D STRENGTHEN THEIR CONCEIT OF THEIR OWN WAY
BUT I SHOULD HAVE RUN THE RISK OF RUINING MANY FOR MY OWN PALTRY AGGRANDISEMENT
I ONLY WISH THAT SHE AND ALL BELONGING TO HER WERE SWEPT BACK TO THE PLACE THEY CAME FROM HE STOOD STILL GAZING INTO THE FIRE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO LONGER
THEY SHALL HUNGER NO MORE NEITHER THIRST ANY MORE
BUT NOW HE WAS GALLED ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO DEFEND WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE SERIOUSLY ATTACKED
HER FATHER WAS OF SLIGHT FIGURE WHICH MADE HIM APPEAR TALLER THAN HE REALLY WAS WHEN NOT CONTRASTED AS AT THIS TIME WITH THE TALL MASSIVE FRAME OF ANOTHER
WE HAD BOWED TO EACH OTHER WELL
IT'S TOO LATE NOW
BUT WHAT DID HE ANSWER TO YOUR FATHER HE DID NA SPEAK WORDS
I KEEP SAYING IT TO MYSELF HALE IS DEAD BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY THE MORE REAL
YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO KNOW HIM
INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT MYSELF OR HIM SO MY MANNERS MUST HAVE SHOWN THE TRUTH
IT IS FINE WHEN THE STUDY OF THE PAST LEADS TO A PROPHECY OF THE FUTURE
HER SON'S STRONG ARMS MIGHT LIFT HER TENDERLY UP INTO A COMFORTABLE POSITION
WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED OH I DUNNO
AND MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT BY THE TIME MISS HALE RECEIVED THIS LETTER HIS POOR MASTER WOULD BE NO MORE
I ALWAYS KEEP MY CONSCIENCE AS TIGHT SHUT UP AS A JACK-IN-A-BOX FOR WHEN IT JUMPS INTO EXISTENCE IT SURPRISES ME BY ITS SIZE
I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN THAT I SHOULD LIVE TO SEE HER BROUGHT SO LOW
MR LENNOX I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE ABOUT FREDERICK I AM ONLY SORRY IT HAS BEEN SO UNSUCCESSFUL REPLIED HE WITH A QUICK GLANCE TOWARDS MR BELL AS IF RECONNOITRING HOW MUCH HE MIGHT SAY BEFORE HIM
IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT HIGGINS WAS IN A PASSION WHEN MARGARET ENTERED
YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED AT ONCE DEAR
IT IS SO DELICIOUS SAID MRS HALE IN A FEEBLE VOICE
BUT THAT WHEEL COSTS A DEAL O MONEY--FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED POUND MAYBE AND BRINGS IN NO PROFIT
THE SORROW WAS NO LESS IN REALITY BUT IT BECAME LESS OPPRESSIVE FROM HAVING SOME ONE IN PRECISELY THE SAME RELATION TO IT AS THAT IN WHICH SHE STOOD
NOT THIS GENERATION MAYBE BUT THEIR FATHERS
AND IT'S OURS TO STAND UP AND FIGHT HARD,--NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE BUT FOR THEM ROUND ABOUT US--FOR JUSTICE AND FAIR PLAY
SHE HALF SATE UP TO SPEAK NOW LAYING HER HAND ON MARGARET'S ARM WITH A GESTURE OF ENTREATY
I RATHER THINK THORNTON IS NOT QUITE EASY IN HIS MIND ABOUT THIS STRIKE
HELP ME AS YOU HELPED ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD
BUT AS TO THIS BOUCHER HE WOULD GO AND SEE HIM THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT COULD BE DONE FOR HIM
BUT SHE FORGETS TO LOVE THE ABSENT A VERY COMMON FAULT
NEVERTHELESS AS A GENERAL RULE IT WAS VERY TRUE WHAT MR THORNTON SAID THAT AS THE STRIKE IF PROLONGED MUST END IN THE MASTERS BRINGING HANDS FROM A DISTANCE IF INDEED THE FINAL RESULT WERE NOT AS IT HAD OFTEN BEEN BEFORE THE INVENTION OF SOME MACHINE WHICH WOULD DIMINISH THE NEED OF HANDS AT ALL WHY IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT THE KINDEST THING WAS TO REFUSE ALL HELP WHICH MIGHT BOLSTER THEM UP IN THEIR FOLLY
IN THE CLOSE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED ROOM OF A LONDON HOTEL
BUT HE RESENTED THOSE WORDS BITTERLY
I CANNOT BEAR IT,--I AM TOO WEAK
WHY ARE NOT YOU IN BED SON JOHN SAID SHE DO YOU THINK I CAN SLEEP WITH AN EASY MIND WHILE YOU KEEP AWAKE FULL OF CARE
AND HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP AND LEANT ON HER ARM AS ON THAT OF A GUIDE
AND I ANTICIPATE CARES AND SORROWS JUST AS IF I WERE AN OLD WOMAN AND WITH THE SAME FEARFUL SPIRIT
AND HIS MOTHER IS DYING HE BEGAN TO CRY AND WAIL LIKE A CHILD
AT LEAST WITHOUT OFFERING ADVICE WHETHER YOU TOOK IT OR NOT MARGARET STOOD BEFORE HER BLUSHING LIKE ANY CULPRIT WITH HER EYES DILATING AS SHE GAZED AT MRS THORNTON
FANNY BECKONED HER MOTHER OUT OF THE ROOM AND TOLD HER SOMETHING THAT MADE HER EQUALLY ANXIOUS WITH MARGARET FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE LATTER
AND TO PERFORM ANY-THING IN THE WAY OF KINDNESS ON BEHALF OF MARGARET MORE DISLIKED AT THIS MOMENT THAN EVER WAS DIFFICULT
BUT THEM'S LEFT AS A CHARGE ON ME
AND THEN--STAY
ONE HAD NEED TO LEARN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND MEASURE BY A DIFFERENT STANDARD UP HERE IN MILTON BESSY TOO WAS RATHER BETTER THIS DAY
I FELT LIKE A GREAT HYPOCRITE TO-NIGHT SITTING THERE IN MY WHITE SILK GOWN WITH MY IDLE HANDS BEFORE ME WHEN I REMEMBERED ALL THE GOOD THOROUGH HOUSE-WORK THEY HAD DONE TO-DAY
AND THAT I OH DEAR!--OH DEAR
I KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG
MARGARET POURED OUT THE TEA IN SILENCE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING AGREEABLE TO SAY
A STEALTHY CREEPING CRANCHING SOUND AMONG THE CRISP FALLEN LEAVES OF THE FOREST BEYOND THE GARDEN SEEMED ALMOST CLOSE AT HAND
AND DIXON SHOWED HER SORROW BY EXTREME CROSSNESS AND A CONTINUAL IRRITABLE ATTEMPT TO KEEP HER PETTICOATS FROM EVEN TOUCHING THE UNCONSCIOUS MR HALE WHOM SHE REGARDED AS THE ORIGIN OF ALL THIS SUFFERING
THE HIDDEN SACRED FIRE EXHAUSTED ITSELF IN SPARKLE AND CRACKLE
BUT WHEN I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP--I DARE SAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MR HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER-OF-FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
I CAN SEE WHAT'S WHAT AND NOT BE BLIND
I HAVE GIVEN UP HOPING FOR IT
AND DO THEY ASK US FOR THE FUTURE HAPPINESS OF OUR LIVES WE LAY IT AT THEIR FEET AND WILL IT AWAY FROM US
MR THORNTON SAID VERY LITTLE
NAMELY SINCE THAT ANOTHER MAY BE GLAD WITH THAT THAT THUS IN SORROW MAKES ME SAD WYATT
HE TOLD ME HE COULD NOT GET LEISURE TO READ WITH YOU LAST NIGHT SIR
ALL I SAY IS MAY NEITHER ME NOR MINE EVER HAVE HIS SORE HEART OR WE MAY DO LIKE THINGS HE HAS LEFT ME ALONE WI A THESE CHILDREN MOANED THE WIDOW LESS DISTRESSED AT THE MANNER OF THE DEATH THAN MARGARET EXPECTED
AND MR LOWE SAID SHE WAS
YOU HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION WHICH WAS A VERY CORRECT ONE I HAVE NO DOUBT
AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE PLACE SHE STOPPED AND LOOKED ROUND
SO SHE BEGAN TO LOOK TOWARDS A LONG VISIT TO THE LENNOXES ON THEIR RETURN TO ENGLAND AS TO A POINT--NO NOT OF HOPE--BUT OF LEISURE IN WHICH SHE COULD REGAIN HER POWER AND COMMAND OVER HERSELF
BUT DIXON ALWAYS WINCED AWAY FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD TO HERSELF WHO BEING NOT MUCH PAST FIFTY WAS SHE THOUGHT IN THE VERY PRIME OF LIFE
THE SIDE OF THE TOWN ON WHICH CRAMPTON LAY WAS ESPECIALLY A THOROUGHFARE FOR THE FACTORY PEOPLE
THE GIRL MUST HAVE SOME WOMAN-FRIEND ABOUT HER IF ONLY TO TALK HER INTO A GOOD FIT OF CRYING DIXON WAS CRYING--ENOUGH FOR TWO
I SHOULD NOT BELIEVE IN GOD IF I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT
THAT THE FACT OF HIS BECOMING RAPIDLY WORSE WHILE IN A STATE OF INTOXICATION SETTLED THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE LAST FATAL ATTACK WAS CAUSED BY EXCESS OF DRINKING OR THE FALL THE FALL
WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY ASKED SHE WITH A DEEP SIGH
BUT AS TO THE CONSTANT GOING TO AND FRO OF BUSY TRADES-PEOPLE IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM THE NORTHERN LINES
AND NOW IT OFTEN HAPPENED THAT A HURRIED NOTE FROM MR THORNTON WOULD ARRIVE JUST AT THE LAST MOMENT SAYING THAT HE WAS SO MUCH ENGAGED THAT HE COULD NOT COME TO READ WITH MR HALE THAT EVENING
HE CAME TO TELL HIGGINS HE WOULD GIVE HIM WORK
AS IT WAS THE INCOMPETENCE OF THE IRISH HANDS WHO HAD TO BE TRAINED TO THEIR WORK AT A TIME REQUIRING UNUSUAL ACTIVITY WAS A DAILY ANNOYANCE
IF YO THINK FOR TO KEEP ME FROM GOING WHAT GAIT I CHOOSE BECAUSE SHE LOVED YO'--AND IN MY OWN HOUSE TOO WHERE I NEVER ASKED YO TO COME YO'RE MISTA'EN
THAT ONE,--IN CRAMPTON DON'T THEY CALL THE SUBURB
HE WENT TO HIS IRISH PEOPLE WITH EVERY NERVE IN HIS BODY THRILLING AT THE THOUGHT OF HER AND FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ENOUGH OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO SOOTHE AND COMFORT AWAY THEIR FEARS
SHE WAS LAID DOWN QUITE FLAT AS IF RESTING LANGUIDLY AFTER SOME PAROXYSM OF PAIN
YOUR POOR MOTHER'S FOND WISH GRATIFIED AT LAST IN THE MOCKING WAY IN WHICH OVER-FOND WISHES ARE TOO OFTEN FULFILLED--SODOM APPLES AS THEY ARE--HAS BROUGHT ON THIS CRISIS FOR WHICH I OUGHT TO BE AND I HOPE I AM THANKFUL
HE TOLD ME THERE WAS AN INTERNAL DISEASE OF LONG STANDING CAUSED BY LEONARDS HABIT OF DRINKING TO EXCESS
SHE'S BEEN VERY MUCH TIRED OF LATE WITH THE HOT WEATHER AND THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING A SERVANT
SUCH A CREATURE
BUT PERHAPS I MISTAKE AND YOU'RE MISS DIXON NO LONGER SO I TOLD HIM HE MIGHT STILL ADDRESS ME AS AN UNMARRIED LADY THOUGH IF I HADN'T BEEN SO PARTICULAR I'D HAD GOOD CHANCES OF MATRIMONY
BUT MR HALE WHEN YOU WERE SETTING UP A WISE PARENT AS A MODEL FOR US YOU SAID HE HUMOURED HIS CHILDREN IN THEIR DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENT ACTION
HE GETS TO LONDON ON FRIDAY MORNING
I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
AND AS MARGARET REACHED THE SMALL SIDE-ENTRANCE BY THE FOLDING DOORS IN THE GREAT DEAD WALL OF MARLBOROUGH MILL-YARD AND WAITED THE PORTER'S ANSWER TO THE BELL SHE LOOKED ROUND AND HEARD THE FIRST LONG FAR-OFF ROLL OF THE TEMPEST;--SAW THE FIRST SLOW-SURGING WAVE OF THE DARK CROWD COME WITH ITS THREATENING CREST TUMBLE OVER AND RETREAT AT THE FAR END OF THE STREET WHICH A MOMENT AGO SEEMED SO FULL OF REPRESSED NOISE BUT WHICH NOW WAS OMINOUSLY STILL
THE AIR ITSELF WAS SO DIFFERENT DEPRIVED OF ALL REVIVIFYING PRINCIPLE AS IT SEEMED TO BE HERE
AND SHE FROWNED AND KICKED ME INTO HIDING AGAIN
IT WAS BUT A HOARSE WHISPER
BUT WE CAN MAKE A MAN'S LIFE SO HEAVY TO BE BORNE THAT HE'S OBLIGED TO COME IN AND BE WISE AND HELPFUL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN WHY THAT'S ANOTHER THING
BUT SINCE I HAVE COME HERE I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH TO MAKE ME RESPECT AND ADMIRE HIM AND TO FEEL HOW MUCH JUSTICE AND TRUTH THERE IS IN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OF HIM WHO SPOKE TO YOU OF HIM ASKED MRS THORNTON A LITTLE MOLLIFIED YET JEALOUS LEST ANY ONE ELSE'S WORDS SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE HIM FULL JUSTICE
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
HE WENT ON REPEATING TO HIMSELF MECHANICALLY AS IT WERE ALL THE FUNERAL SERVICE AS IT WAS READ BY THE OFFICIATING CLERGYMAN
HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE-MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS VERY GOOD
HE DID NOT SPEAK EASILY OF MR THORNTON
MR THORNTON SMILED SCORNFULLY AS HE HEARD THEM
HE CHOSE OUT HER ATTORNEY
WHERE SHALL I GO
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO TOUCH ON THE SORENESS OF HIS HIGH DIGNITY
NOW THE ERROR WHICH MANY PARENTS COMMIT IN THE TREATMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL AT THIS TIME IS INSISTING ON THE SAME UNREASONING OBEDIENCE AS WHEN ALL HE HAD TO DO IN THE WAY OF DUTY WAS TO OBEY THE SIMPLE LAWS OF COME WHEN YOU'RE CALLED AND DO AS YOU'RE BID BUT A WISE PARENT HUMOURS THE DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENT ACTION SO AS TO BECOME THE FRIEND AND ADVISER WHEN HIS ABSOLUTE RULE SHALL CEASE
AS FOR SLICKSON I TAKE IT SOME O THESE DAYS HE'LL WHEEDLE HIS MEN BACK WI FAIR PROMISES
AND SHE HAD A MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT DEAR JANET THE FUTURE UNSEEN SISTER-IN-LAW FOR WHOM SHE PROFESSED SO MUCH AFFECTION THAT IF MARGARET HAD NOT BEEN VERY PROUD SHE MIGHT HAVE ALMOST FELT JEALOUS OF THE MUSHROOM RIVAL
YOU SEE HOW SHE OVERPOWERS ME MR LENNOX SAID HE
HERE AND THERE A GREAT OBLONG MANY-WINDOWED FACTORY STOOD UP LIKE A HEN AMONG HER CHICKENS PUFFING OUT BLACK UNPARLIAMENTARY SMOKE AND SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTING FOR THE CLOUD WHICH MARGARET HAD TAKEN TO FORETELL RAIN
IT'S FOR TO KEEP TH WIDOW AND CHILDER OF A MAN WHO WAS DROVE MAD BY THEM KNOBSTICKS O YOURN
THERE MIGHT BE TOILERS AND MOILERS THERE IN LONDON BUT SHE NEVER SAW THEM
IT WAS WILFUL AT THE TIME REPENTED OF AFTERWARDS
THOU'LL NEVER GO PEACH ON THAT POOR CLEMMED MAN
IT'S NEARLY A YEAR SINCE EDITH WAS MARRIED OH YES MAMMA
I'M AFRAID HE WAS BUT A DRUNKEN FELLOW THOUGH THERE IS NO DOUBT HE CAME TO HIS DEATH BY VIOLENCE AT LAST
HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR NO MAMMA
I'M SURE YOU'LL CARE FOR IT AND STUDY WHAT IS IN IT FOR HIS SAKE YO MAY SAY THAT
I ALWAYS HAVE A LARGE ORDER TO GIVE TO JOHNSON'S THE DAY AFTER A CONCERT DO YOU LIKE NEW MUSIC SIMPLY FOR ITS NEWNESS THEN OH
AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO LET MYSELF BE KNOWN EVEN BY THOSE WHOM I DESIRE TO KNOW AND WITH WHOM I WOULD FAIN HAVE NO RESERVE
THE ACCUSTOMED PLACES BROUGHT BACK THE ACCUSTOMED HABITS AND TRAINS OF THOUGHT
BETTER GET THE WORST OVER
AND AT ALL THE TENDERNESS WHICH HER FATHER IN HIS TURN NOW LAVISHED UPON HER SHE ONLY CRIED THE MORE
ASK HIM TO GIVE YO A BUMPER TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS ORDERS
BUT I DID NOT KNOW THEN
BESIDES THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN DURING THE SERVANTS DINNER
AND ONLY RECOVERED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR BEING ANGRY AT EVERY SUGGESTION OF HIS MAN'S
HE HAD LOCKED UP A GOOD DEAL OF HIS CAPITAL IN NEW AND EXPENSIVE MACHINERY AND HE HAD ALSO BOUGHT COTTON LARGELY FOR THE FULFILMENT OF THESE ORDERS TAKEN UNDER CONTRACT
NOW SHE IS NO MORE FIT FOR TRAVELLING THAN I AM FOR FLYING
BUT I WON'T CARE FOR HIM
HOW CREEPING AND DEADLY THAT FEAR WHICH COULD BOW DOWN THE TRUTHFUL MARGARET TO FALSEHOOD
THE BOUCHER CHILDREN LEFT MOTHERLESS ORPHANS CLAIMED WHAT OF MARGARET'S CARE SHE COULD BESTOW
MAMMA WAS GETTING TO LOVE ME SO
MARGARET TOOK IT UP
SO YOUR MOTHER IS TIRED AND GONE TO BED EARLY
BUT GIVE ME A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY IN OUR PRESENT STATE OF MORALS AND INTELLIGENCE
BUT SHE ALTERNATELY DREADED AND FIRED UP AGAINST THE WORKMEN WHO COMMENTED NOT ON HER DRESS BUT ON HER LOOKS IN THE SAME OPEN FEARLESS MANNER
BESS POOR LASS HAD A LITTLE STOCK UNDER HER PILLOW READY TO SLIP INTO MY HAND LAST MOMENT AND MARY IS FUSTIAN-CUTTING
HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF-OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION
JUST NOW THERE ARE NO SOUNDS TO COME FROM THE MILL
HE COULD NOT FORGET THE FOND AND EARNEST LOOK THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HER AND SOME OTHER MAN--THE ATTITUDE OF FAMILIAR CONFIDENCE IF NOT OF POSITIVE ENDEARMENT
A MORE HOPEFUL MAN MIGHT IMAGINE THAT A CLOSER AND MORE GENIAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN CLASSES MIGHT DO AWAY WITH STRIKES
MARGARET ASKED THE SISTER FOR A CUP OF WATER AND WHILE SHE RAN TO FETCH IT KNOCKING DOWN THE FIRE-IRONS AND TUMBLING OVER A CHAIR IN HER WAY SHE UNLOOSED BESSY'S BONNET STRINGS TO RELIEVE HER CATCHING BREATH
MR LENNOX WONDERED HOW HIS BROTHER THE CAPTAIN COULD HAVE REPORTED HER AS HAVING LOST ALL HER GOOD LOOKS
EVERY CORNER SEEMED FILLED UP WITH ORNAMENT UNTIL IT BECAME A WEARINESS TO THE EYE AND PRESENTED A STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE BALD UGLINESS OF THE LOOK-OUT INTO THE GREAT MILL-YARD WHERE WIDE FOLDING GATES WERE THROWN OPEN FOR THE ADMISSION OF CARRIAGES
IT REMINDED HER OF THE NEW FEAR IN THEIR LIVES
I AM SURE YOU WOULD LIKE--NO LOVE IS THE RIGHT WORD LIKE IS SO POOR--YOU WOULD LOVE HER FATHER IF YOU KNEW HER
SHE NOW WOULD NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE FORCE OF THE TEMPTATION
THE POOR WOMAN EVIDENTLY BELIEVED IN ITS EFFICACY
MARGARET DID NOT TAKE ANY COMFORT FROM WHAT DIXON SAID BUT THE UNUSUAL TENDERNESS OF THE PRIM OLD SERVANT'S MANNER TOUCHED HER TO THE HEART
SHE WAS VERY MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND TIRED WITH RAISING HERSELF AT EVERY STEP TO LOOK OUT AND SEE IF IT WAS MARGARET COMING
BUT HE DID NOT DESPAIR
WOULD YOU MILTON MEN CONDESCEND TO SEND UP YOUR TO-DAY'S DIFFICULTY TO OXFORD
I MAKE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE
HE WAS WAITING FOR A BUS AND JUST THEN IT DROVE UP AND HE HAILED IT
SHE WAS PUNGENT AND HAD TASTE AND SPIRIT AND FLAVOUR IN HER
SOMEHOW THEN IT SEEMS AS IF MY PAIN WAS NEEDED FOR THE FULFILMENT
I COULD NOT TELL HER ALL AT ONCE HOO MUN BE TOLD BECAUSE OF TH INQUEST
PERHAPS IT'S AS WELL SUCH A ONE AS BOUCHER HAS TH UNION TO SEE AFTER HIM
DON'T HAVE A STRANGER AND LEAVE ME OUT
WE HAVE RAIN AND OUR LEAVES DO FALL AND GET SODDEN
MRS THORNTON STOOD UP TO GO BUT YET SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY
IT'S MY OWN HOUSE
SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF AT HIS FEET AND WAS STRANGELY DISTRESSED AT HER FALL
AND SHE WENT QUICKLY AWAY WHILE THE LIGHT CAUSED BY THE PLEASURE OF HAVING SOMETHING TO GIVE YET LINGERED ON MARY'S FACE
IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY WHAT HE IS DOING
BUT I HAVE A KINDNESS FOR ALL SUSANS FOR SIMPLE SUSAN'S SAKE MY LITTLE SUSAN WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I LEFT WITHOUT WISHING HER GOODBYE
MR LENNOX HAS DISCOVERED THAT HE SAILED FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY LAST AUGUST
AS FAR AS FORDHAM BEECHES
WHENEVER THIS IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER AT THE END OF A LONG AVENUE OF THOUGHTS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM FOLLOWING THAT PATH--SHE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IN IT
SHE KNEW AT ONCE IT WAS THE PRESENT VICAR'S WIFE HER MOTHER'S SUCCESSOR
WE WON'T ADVANCE A PENNY
AND NOW I SHALL HAVE TO TURN OUT AND FIND MY WAY TO THE CLARENDON YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE CLARENDON
WHY I TOLD THAT FALSEHOOD IN SHORT WHICH I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR
SHE REMEMBERED MR THORNTON'S LOOK OF CALM DISDAIN AS IN FEW WORDS HE GAVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE GREAT SCHEME OF COMMERCE ALL DISHONOURABLE WAYS OF ACTING WERE SURE TO PROVE INJURIOUS IN THE LONG RUN AND THAT TESTING SUCH ACTIONS SIMPLY ACCORDING TO THE POOR STANDARD OF SUCCESS THERE WAS FOLLY AND NOT WISDOM IN ALL SUCH AND EVERY KIND OF DECEIT IN TRADE AS WELL AS IN OTHER THINGS
AND HE MIGHT TELL THEM HOW TO PREPARE HER FOR SEEING FREDERICK
HE LOOKED AT HER STILL WITH THAT SEARCHING LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO FADE OUT OF HIS EYES AS HE GAZED
BUT THE CONVERSATION WENT ON
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT HIM UNPREPOSSESSING IF YOU HAD SEEN HIM WITH MAMMA I FANCY IT MUST BE TIME TO GO AND TAKE MY TICKET
AT ANOTHER TIME HE COULD HAVE ENJOYED MR BELL'S HALF TESTY CONDEMNATION OF A TOWN WHERE THE LIFE WAS SO AT VARIANCE WITH EVERY HABIT HE HAD FORMED
AND YET SHE COULD NOT MIGHT NOT GIVE ANY EXPLANATION
BUT SHE WENT ON A LITTLE MORE EAGERLY HIGGINS DID NOT QUITE TELL YOU THE EXACT TRUTH THE WORD TRUTH REMINDED HER OF HER OWN UNTRUTH AND SHE STOPPED SHORT FEELING EXCEEDINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE
I CAN'T BEAR TO PART WITH YOU AND YET I AM MISERABLE WITH ANXIETY AS LONG AS YOU STOP HERE WELL THEN SAID MARGARET LISTEN TO MY PLAN
SHE WINCED AWAY FROM IT MORE FROM REMEMBERING FORMER OCCASIONS ON WHICH HE HAD TRIED TO LEAD HER INTO A DISCUSSION IN WHICH HE TOOK THE COMPLIMENTARY PART ABOUT HER OWN CHARACTER AND WAYS OF GOING ON
MARGARET COMFORTED HER AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT SHE COULD HARDLY EXPLAIN TO HER HOW THIS IDEA OF SPAIN MERE CHATEAU EN ESPAGNE AS IT MIGHT BE CHARMED AND DELIGHTED HER
CAN YOU STOP--CAN YOU SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT
PAPA IS UTTERLY PROSTRATE WITH THIS GREAT GRIEF YOU EXPECT ME DON'T YOU NO WE HAVE HAD NO LETTER THEN I HAVE COME BEFORE IT
MARGARET HAD TO SHAKE OFF THE RECOLLECTIONS OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE AND SAID THROUGH THE DAY AND TURN A SYMPATHISING LISTENER TO THE ACCOUNT OF HOW DIXON HAD COMPLAINED THAT THE IRONING-BLANKET HAD BEEN BURNT AGAIN
HIGGINS I DON'T KNOW YOU TO-DAY
STAY THERE'S A RING SHE SATE DOWN INSTANTLY AND BENT HER HEAD ATTENTIVELY OVER HER WORK
HE CHAFED AND CHAFED AND THOUGHT MR BELL A MOST PROSY COMPANION
AY MISS
SO FOR MAMMA'S SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF HER FAITHFULNESS I DO THINK SHE MUST GO VERY WELL MY DEAR
HE CAME UP TO MARGARET AND KISSED HER FOREHEAD
I GIVE HER UP BECAUSE I MUST
HE CAME IN A LITTLE FLUSHED BUT HIS EYES GLEAMING AS IN ANSWER TO THE TRUMPET-CALL OF DANGER AND WITH A PROUD LOOK OF DEFIANCE ON HIS FACE THAT MADE HIM A NOBLE IF NOT A HANDSOME MAN
THE EMPLOYER TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE RACE HE COULD NO LONGER RUN WITH A BITTER SENSE OF INCOMPETENCY AND FAILURE--WOUNDED IN THE STRUGGLE--TRAMPLED DOWN BY HIS FELLOWS IN THEIR HASTE TO GET RICH--SLIGHTED WHERE HE ONCE WAS HONOURED--HUMBLY ASKING FOR INSTEAD OF BESTOWING EMPLOYMENT WITH A LORDLY HAND
BUT NOW THE RECOLLECTION OF HER CLINGING DEFENCE OF HIM SEEMED TO THRILL HIM THROUGH AND THROUGH,--TO MELT AWAY EVERY RESOLUTION ALL POWER OF SELF-CONTROL AS IF IT WERE WAX BEFORE A FIRE
THORNTON O MARLBOROUGH MILL AS WE CALL HIM HE IS ONE OF THE MASTERS YOU ARE STRIVING WITH IS HE NOT
COULD NOT YOU AND I AND MAMMA LIVE ON A HUNDRED A YEAR IN SOME VERY CHEAP--VERY QUIET PART OF ENGLAND
MARGARET BORE ALL MEEKLY ONLY TRUSTING THAT HER FATHER MIGHT NOT RETURN
AND WITH A YOUNG MAN STILL NO ANSWER
YO'R A PARSON OUT O WORK I BELIEVE
MAMMA WILL COME DIRECTLY MISS HALE
JUST NOW I FEEL AS IF TWENTY YEARS HARD STUDY OF LAW WOULD BE AMPLY REWARDED BY ONE YEAR OF SUCH AN EXQUISITE SERENE LIFE AS THIS--SUCH SKIES LOOKING UP--'SUCH CRIMSON AND AMBER FOLIAGE SO PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AS THAT POINTING TO SOME OF THE GREAT FOREST TREES WHICH SHUT IN THE GARDEN AS IF IT WERE A NEST
CHAPTER XXIX A RAY OF SUNSHINE SOME WISHES CROSSED MY MIND AND DIMLY CHEERED IT AND ONE OR TWO POOR MELANCHOLY PLEASURES EACH IN THE PALE UNWARMING LIGHT OF HOPE SILVERING ITS FLIMSY WING FLEW SILENT BY MOTHS IN THE MOONBEAM COLERIDGE
OF COURSE THERE IS NONE OR YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND IT BY THIS TIME IF YOU FOLLOWED MY DIRECTIONS
WHICH WAS DRY BONES BUT NOT THE LIVING INTELLIGENCE SHE LONGED FOR
THE SHADOW ON HER COUNTENANCE TOLD THAT SHE AT LEAST BELIEVED IN THE TRUTH OF WHAT SHE SAID
SHE WAS SO TERRIBLY SICK AND FAINT THAT SHE WAS THANKFUL TO BE ABLE TO TURN INTO THE LADIES WAITING-ROOM AND SIT DOWN FOR AN INSTANT
MR THORNTON I BELIEVE SAID MARGARET AFTER A HALF-INSTANT'S PAUSE DURING WHICH HIS UNREADY WORDS WOULD NOT COME
THIS LIFE--AT LEAST THESE WALKS--REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS
SHE REPLIED HE IS VERY KIND AND ATTENTIVE,--THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT I WONDER MRS THORNTON NEVER CALLS
WHEN I REMEMBER BOUCHER'S HALF MAD WORDS AND WAYS I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK HOW COOLLY MR THORNTON SPOKE IN THE FIRST PLACE I AM NOT SO CONVINCED AS YOU ARE ABOUT THAT MAN BOUCHER'S UTTER DISTRESS
AND YET THERE WAS NO WIND
I RECOLLECT
I RECOLLECT
SHE IS NOT STRONG REPLIED MRS THORNTON SHORTLY
MR THORNTON'S FELL TO NEARLY HALF
BUT IT HAS BURST LIKE MANY ANOTHER
I'D TELL EM MY MIND
STEADY ON THY LEGS AND RIGHT ARM OUT AS STRAIGHT AS A SHEWER
WHICH WERE GROWING EVER GLOOMIER AND MORE GLOOMY
BUT ABOUT THE HORSES I'M DETERMINED
BUT AT LAST SHE WAS CALM AND GREEDILY WATCHED HER DAUGHTER AS SHE BEGAN HER LETTER
THAT WILL NOT LEAVE THE ROOM ALTHOUGH WE WAKEN UP AND RUB OUR EYES AND FORCE A STIFF RIGID SMILE UPON OUR LIPS
BUT THIS WISH OF MRS HALE'S WAS SO NATURAL SO JUST SO RIGHT TO BOTH PARTIES THAT MARGARET FELT AS IF ON FREDERICK'S ACCOUNT AS WELL AS ON HER MOTHER'S SHE OUGHT TO OVERLOOK ALL INTERMEDIATE CHANCES OF DANGER AND PLEDGE HERSELF TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER FOR ITS REALISATION
NOW I REMEMBER YOU WERE AGAINST ME THIS MORNING AND WERE QUITE MILTONIAN AND MANUFACTURING IN YOUR PREFERENCES MARGARET SAW THE QUICK GLANCE OF SURPRISE THAT MR THORNTON GAVE HER AND SHE WAS ANNOYED AT THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH HE MIGHT PUT ON THIS SPEECH OF MR BELL'S
MARTHA'S WHOLE FACE BRIGHTENED AND ON A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT OUT CAME A LONG STORY OF HOW HER FATHER HAD BEEN IN EARLY LIFE CONNECTED WITH MRS THORNTON'S HUSBAND--NAY HAD EVEN BEEN IN A POSITION TO SHOW HIM SOME KINDNESS
THEY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS THE WEARY ARE AT REST HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP SLOWLY SLOWLY MARGARET TURNED AWAY FROM THE BED
SEE THAT A ROOM OR WHATEVER SHE WANTS IS GOT READY FOR HER BY TO-MORROW NIGHT
WITH ALL MY HEART THOUGH I HAVE NOT AN IDEA WHO LITTLE SUSAN MAY BE
MR BELL OF OXFORD MR BELL HE REPEATED
MRS THORNTON WAS SHY
AND OUTSIDE A THICK FOG CREPT UP TO THE VERY WINDOWS AND WAS DRIVEN IN TO EVERY OPEN DOOR IN CHOKING WHITE WREATHS OF UNWHOLESOME MIST
I AM QUITE DISINTERESTED I AM AWARE OF THAT SAID MARGARET FORCING HERSELF TO SPEAK IN AN INDIFFERENT CARELESS WAY
OH GOD
AND WITH TEA CAME MR HENRY LENNOX WHO HAD WALKED UP TO HARLEY STREET AFTER A LATE DINNER AND HAD EVIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND HIS BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW AT HOME
WHAT HAD MR THORNTON DONE
IF YOU ARE A COWARD JANE I AM NOT
NOTHING BUT HERE AND THERE A LARK HIGH IN THE AIR
AFTER TEA MR HALE GOT UP AND STOOD WITH HIS ELBOW ON THE CHIMNEY-PIECE LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND MUSING OVER SOMETHING AND FROM TIME TO TIME SIGHING DEEPLY
BUT IT GAVE HIM THE TRUEST PLEASURE
SUCH A NEAR CHANCE
IT IS PLAIN MATTER-OF-FACT
MR LENNOX HASTILY INTRODUCED THE TWO FIGURES INTO HIS SKETCH AND FINISHED UP THE LANDSCAPE WITH A SUBORDINATE REFERENCE TO THEM--AS MARGARET PERCEIVED WHEN THE TIME CAME FOR GETTING UP PUTTING AWAY WATER AND SCRAPS OF PAPER AND EXHIBITING TO EACH OTHER THEIR SKETCHES
YOU DON'T APPREHEND ANY MORE VIOLENCE DO YOU
FOR FOR SOME TIME THE LATTER THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO SHOW HER SENSE OF AFFRONT BY SAYING AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE TO HER YOUNG LADY
SO SHE TURNED TO HER AND ASKED HOW IS OLD BETTY BARNES I DON'T KNOW SAID THE WOMAN RATHER SHORTLY
GRIEF HATH AN INFLUENCE SO HUSH'D AND HOLY HOOD
BESIDE I SHALL BE A DEAL HERE TO MAKE IT MORE LIVELY FOR THEE TOBACCO-SMOKE CHOKES ME SAID SHE QUERULOUSLY
SO IN THEY CAME ON THE FRIDAY AND DREW BACK THEIR CLAIM AND NOW HE'S OBLIGED TO GO ON WORKING
HOW ALTERED
IT DIED AWAY INTO PROFOUND STILLNESS BETWEEN WHILES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EVENING SHE WAS CALLED DOWN TO SPEAK TO MARY HIGGINS
HE WAS QUIETER AND LESS SELF-ASSERTING
I COULD NOT HELP COMING IN TO ASK YOU TO PRAY WITH ME--TO SAY THE LORD'S PRAYER
HER TEETH WERE SHUT NOT COMPRESSED
THE LODGE-KEEPER ADMITTED THEM INTO A GREAT OBLONG YARD ON ONE SIDE OF WHICH WERE OFFICES FOR THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS
HE IS UNABLE TO KEEP IT ON
MRS MURRAY MADE IT AND IT'S SURE TO BE RIGHT
WHO ARE THESE HALES THAT HE MAKES SUCH A FUSS ABOUT FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER
NOW MR THORNTON THOUGH KNOBSTICK HAS NOT A VERY PRETTY SOUND IS IT NOT EXPRESSIVE
SHE WAS KNEELING BY THE SOFA HIDING HER FACE IN THE CUSHIONS THAT NO ONE MIGHT HEAR HER CRY WHEN SHE WAS TOUCHED ON THE SHOULDER BY DIXON
I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME
IT WAS ALMOST A SURPRISE TO SEE HIM
GOOD NIGHT--GOOD AFTERNOON M'APPEN I SHOULD SAY--BUT TH LIGHT IS DIM AN MISTY TO-DAY CHAPTER XX MEN AND GENTLEMEN OLD AND YOUNG BOY LET EM ALL EAT I HAVE IT
HE WAS STANDING BY THE FIREPLACE SHRUNK AND STOOPING
OR ELSE HE DID RIGHT MARGARET
WHAT A PERFECT LIFE YOU SEEM TO LIVE HERE
HER BENT HEAD HER FACE RAISED WITH NO APPEAL FOR A TEMPORARY REPRIEVE SHOWED THAT QUICK OBSERVER OF HUMAN NATURE THAT SHE THOUGHT IT BETTER THAT THE WHOLE TRUTH SHOULD BE TOLD
AND THERE ARE COUSINS AND WHAT NOT CLAIMING HER IN LONDON AS IF SHE WERE A LAP-DOG BELONGING TO THEM
HE WAS CLOSE BY HIS HANDSOME BROTHER
HE WAITED AWHILE LONGING FOR HER TO SAY SOMETHING EVEN A TAUNT TO WHICH HE MIGHT REPLY
LET ME TRY AT ANY RATE
HE WALKED UNEASILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
THESE DINNERS WERE DELIGHTFUL
MRS THORNTON AND FANNY WERE IN THE DINING-ROOM
HE LOVED HIM SAID SHE
AND YET WHEN IT DID SO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN IT AND HER OWN THOUGHTS FORCED HER INTO SUDDEN WEEPING
SHE TOLD HER SON THAT SHE WISHED THEY HAD NEVER COME NEAR THE PLACE
BUT ONE MORNING SHE RECEIVED A LETTER SAYING THAT NEXT WEEK HE MEANT TO COME UP TO TOWN
SO HE LAY AWAKE DETERMINING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT
SO FAR SO GOOD
GOOD HANDS AND GOOD CITIZENS WHO WERE FRIENDLY TO LAW AND JUDGMENT AND WOULD UPHOLD ORDER
BUT INSTEAD SHE IRONED AWAY LISTENING TO DIXON'S COMPLAINTS AND ONLY HOPING THAT BY AN EXCESS OF SYMPATHY SHE MIGHT PREVENT HER FROM CARRYING THE RECITAL OF HER SORROWS TO MRS HALE
SO WE SOLD OUR OLD PIANO WHEN WE CAME HERE I WONDER HOW YOU CAN EXIST WITHOUT ONE
WHY DID SHE CARE FOR WHAT HE THOUGHT IN SPITE OF ALL HER PRIDE IN SPITE OF HERSELF
IT WAS A GREAT CHANGE TO LEAVE IT AND COME TO MILTON HE TOOK UP HIS NEWSPAPER WITH A DETERMINED AIR AS IF RESOLVED TO AVOID FURTHER CONVERSATION
IF IT WERE ONLY FOR HER SAKE I WISH HE WOULD COME AND THEN AT LEAST I SHOULD KNOW HOW MUCH I WAS ABASED IN HIS EYES CHAPTER XXXVIII PROMISES FULFILLED THEN PROUDLY PROUDLY UP SHE ROSE THO THE TEAR WAS IN HER E'E WHATE'ER YE SAY THINK WHAT YE MAY YE'S GET NA WORD FRAE ME SCOTCH BALLAD
HE SAID THIS
NO SHE REPLIED WITH INNOCENT CURIOSITY
WHY HE HAS NEVER PAID ME OFF THAT FIVE SHILLINGS'--AND SO THEY WENT ON
BUT LOVE STEALS IN UNAWARES
MY POOR SISTER HALE
I DUNNO WHAT TO MAKE OF YO NOR I OF MYSELF
THE LONG SEAMS WERE HEAVY AND HAD AN UNUSUAL WEIGHT FOR HER LANGUID ARMS
ANY WOMAN WOULD HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME
ACCORDINGLY MARGARET WENT
AND UNDER THIS IDEA SHE COULD FEEL GRATEFUL--NOT YET IF EVER SHE SHOULD IF HIS INTERFERENCE HAD BEEN PROMPTED BY CONTEMPT
I CANNOT SAY
BUT TO HAVE STOOD BY WITHOUT WORD OR ACT WHILE THE AUTHORITY WAS BRUTALLY USED WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY WORSE
IT WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN A YEAR SINCE SHE HAD SEEN HIM
A HOE
IN YOUR STUDY QUITE ALONE
PERHAPS THAT'S ALL THE REASON
HE WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
SHE BORE UP BETTER THAN LIKELY UNDER THIS GRIEF
BUT I'M SURE YOU LOOK TOO TIRED YES SAID MARGARET
DID NOT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE HEROIC SIMPLICITY OF THE HOMERIC LIFE NERVE YOU UP NOT ONE BIT EXCLAIMED MR THORNTON LAUGHING
JANE RESUMED HER BATHING AS IF WHAT SARAH DID OR SAID WAS NOT EXACTLY THE THING SHE LIKED TO REPEAT
I THOUGHT YOU AND MAMMA HAD'--AND THEN SHE STOPPED CHECKING HER NATURAL INTEREST REGARDING THEIR FUTURE LIFE AS SHE SAW THE GATHERING GLOOM ON HER FATHER'S BROW
I'LL WATCH OVER MISSUS
I'M SURE IT WOULD BE THE VERY BEST THING FOR AUNT HALE'S HEALTH
AND PERHAPS SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS TOO MUCH AS IF SHE HAD A RIGHT TO CATECHISE
I LEFT MAMMA POURING CONGRATULATIONS DOWN HER THROAT AND STOLE AWAY TO TELL YOU IT SEEMED TO BE SUPPOSED BY GENERAL CONSENT THAT THE MOST NATURAL THING WAS TO CONSIDER MR LENNOX HENCEFORWARD AS MARGARET'S LEGAL ADVISER
AND AS HE WAS ONE WHO HAD SHOWN HIMSELF OBLIGING SHE WAS DISPOSED TO TREAT HIM WITH A FULL MEASURE OF CIVILITY
AND FROM TIME TO TIME THE HOT FLUSH CAME OVER HER PALE FACE SWEEPING IT INTO COLOUR AS A SUNBEAM FROM BETWEEN WATERY CLOUDS COMES SWIFTLY MOVING OVER THE SEA
BUT SHE HAD LEARNT IN THOSE SOLEMN HOURS OF THOUGHT THAT SHE HERSELF MUST ONE DAY ANSWER FOR HER OWN LIFE AND WHAT SHE HAD DONE WITH IT
THAT DREAD HAS HAUNTED ME FOR MANY WEEKS
HER OUT-OF-DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT
MARGARET'S HEAD STILL ACHED AS THE PALENESS OF HER COMPLEXION AND HER SILENCE MIGHT HAVE TESTIFIED
AND THEY BELIEVED THAT HE LEFT WITH THE IDEA OF GOING THERE
A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS SHE HAD FOUND HER LEVEL AND DECIDED THAT SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN IT AGAIN AND THAT TO HER IT WOULD ALWAYS BE THE PRETTIEST SPOT IN THE WORLD BUT THAT IT WAS SO FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS WITH FORMER DAYS AND ESPECIALLY WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER THAT IF IT WERE ALL TO COME OVER AGAIN SHE SHOULD SHRINK BACK FROM SUCH ANOTHER VISIT AS THAT WHICH SHE HAD PAID WITH MR BELL
THEN MRS BOUCHER BEGAN IN A LOW GROWLING TONE GATHERING IN WILDNESS AS SHE WENT ON
YOU'VE BEEN TO MRS BOUCHER'S
I WANT FOR TO SPEAK TO YO SIR CAN'T STAY NOW MY MAN
THAT IS RATHER A HARD WORD PERHAPS IT IS
SHE GRUMBLES SO MUCH ABOUT THE STAIRS AT HESTON
THEN SHE WENT INTO THE STUDY PAUSED--TOTTERED FORWARD--PAUSED AGAIN--SWAYED FOR AN INSTANT WHERE SHE STOOD AND FELL PRONE ON THE FLOOR IN A DEAD SWOON
SHE APOLOGETICALLY CONTINUED TO MARGARET HE'S ALWAYS MITHERING ME FOR DADDY AND BUTTY AND I HA NO BUTTIES TO GIVE HIM AND DADDY'S AWAY AND FORGOTTEN US A I THINK
HIS BUSINESS IS LARGE--EXTENDING EVERY YEAR
MRS THORNTON STOOD LOOKING AT THEM LONG,--THEY HAD BEEN HER PRIDE WHEN SHE WAS FIRST MARRIED
HE TOO WAS ANNOYED TO FIND HER THERE
HIS BLOOD WAS A LITTLE ROUSED BY MR THORNTON'S MANNER MORE THAN BY HIS WORDS
AND NOT TO HAVE SO MANY BRIDESMAIDS AND TO HAVE NO WEDDING-BREAKFAST
ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN CHANGES--THOSE GREAT VISIBLE STRIDES TOWARDS DEATH HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE NIGHT AND HER OWN FAMILY WERE STARTLED BY THE GRAY SUNKEN LOOK HER FEATURES HAD ASSUMED IN THAT ONE TWELVE HOURS OF SUFFERING
HERE SAID SHE TURNING SHARPLY ROUND I'LL COME AND SEE YOUR SISTER
BUT HE HAD A STRONG WILL OF HIS OWN AND AS SOON AS HE BURST OUT INTO ONE OF HIS STORMY PASSIONS EDITH WOULD THROW HERSELF BACK IN DESPAIR AND FATIGUE AND SIGH OUT OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO WITH HIM
I DON'T BELIEVE IT HE EXCLAIMED
OF COURSE I SHALL APPLY TO MY FATHER IN THE FIRST INSTANCE FOR ANY INFORMATION HE CAN GIVE ME IF I GET PUZZLED WITH LIVING HERE AMONGST THIS STRANGE SOCIETY YOU THINK IT STRANGE
DON'T EXAGGERATE MISSY
I AM NOT LIVING IN A TALKING BABBLING WORLD NOR YET AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO WORM FACTS OUT OF ME
AND MARGARET SATE ABASHED
THEY WERE STANDING STILL FOR A MOMENT CLOSE ON THE FIELD SIDE OF THE STILE LEADING INTO THE ROAD
SUCH A GIRL AS THAT WOULD WIN MY HEART IF I WERE THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER
MRS THORNTON HAD OF COURSE ENTIRELY CEASED TO COME TO THE HOUSE
HE SIGHED TWICE OR THRICE WHEN ALL WAS ENDED
BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME TO GET SICK AND TIRED O STRIKES
BUT HE SHOOK IT OFF AND BADE MR AND MRS HALE GOOD NIGHT
YOU AND YOUR UNION WOULD SOON BE DOWN UPON HIM
SUDDENLY SHE TOOK A CANDLE AND WENT INTO HER FATHER'S STUDY FOR A GREAT ATLAS AND LUGGING IT BACK INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM SHE BEGAN TO PORE OVER THE MAP OF ENGLAND
POOR MAMMA
I SEE IT BY THE LIKENESS
DID SHE NOT RUSH DOWN AND CLING TO YOU TO SAVE YOU FROM DANGER SHE DID SAID HE
YET SOMETHING POSSESSED MARGARET TO FORCE THE INFORMATION SHE FORESAW YET DREADED FROM HER MOTHER
I DIFFER FROM YOU
BUT INDEED I COULD NOT GO VERY WELL
HER EYES GLITTERED HER COLOUR WAS DEEPENED ON CHEEK AND LIP
THERE WAS ONE COMFORT
I WILL TRY AND BE HUMBLE AND LEARN HER WAYS IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME DO ALL I CAN FOR YOU
SHE HAD WITH ALL HER TERROR A LURKING CURIOSITY ABOUT SPAIN THE INQUISITION AND POPISH MYSTERIES
FOR THE HOUR--AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO WAS SO THOROUGHLY FEELING THE NOTHINGNESS OF EARTH--HE WAS REASONABLE AND SELF-CONTROLLED
HE WAS NOT IN A MOOD FOR JOKING
OBEYING HER SWIFT IMPULSE MARGARET PASSED OUT BEFORE HIM SAYING NOT A WORD ONLY BOWING LOW TO HIDE THE SUDDEN PALENESS THAT SHE FELT HAD COME OVER HER FACE
THE FORMER SEEMS A SMART WELL-MEANING MAN
JUST RIGHT
HER ONLY FEELING WAS INDIGNATION THAT HER CAT HAD BEEN CHOSEN OUT FROM ALL OTHERS FOR A SACRIFICE
IF I HAD ACCEPTED IT I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE A FRESH DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY TO THE LITURGY AT MY INSTITUTION
AND MARGARET AFTER A PAUSE OF A FEW MINUTES FOUND AS SHE FANCIED THAT IN SPITE OF THE BUZZ IN THE NEXT ROOM EDITH HAD ROLLED HERSELF UP INTO A SOFT BALL OF MUSLIN AND RIBBON AND SILKEN CURLS AND GONE OFF INTO A PEACEFUL LITTLE AFTER-DINNER NAP
FOR IRISH HORDES WERE BIDDERS HERE OUR HALF-PAID WORK TO DO CORN LAW RHYMES
HE WALKS TO THE VERY EXTREMITY OF HIS PARISH
AND THEN WITH HIS HAND JERKING AS IF SOME ONE ELSE MOVED IT AGAINST HIS WILL HE GAVE ME A WICKED NEWSPAPER TO READ CALLING OUR FREDERICK A TRAITOR OF THE BLACKEST DYE A BASE UNGRATEFUL DISGRACE TO HIS PROFESSION OH
IF YO AND I DID NA AGREE IN OUR OPINION O YOUR CONDUCT YO MIGHT TURN ME OFF AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE UPON MY WORD YOU DON'T THINK SMALL BEER OF YOURSELF
I HAD QUITE A PROPHETIC FEELING WHEN CAPTAIN LENNOX'--AND HERE THE VOICE DROPPED INTO A WHISPER BUT MARGARET COULD EASILY SUPPLY THE BLANK
FREDERICK TURNED ROUND RIGHT FACING THE LAMP WHERE THE GAS DARTED UP IN VIVID ANTICIPATION OF THE TRAIN
SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE
IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING IF THEY MIXED A LITTLE MORE IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THE MILTONERS
IF I'VE SAID IT AT TIMES IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO MYSELF JUST IN PRIVATE BY WAY OF MAKING A LITTLE AGREEABLE CONVERSATION FOR THERE'S NO ONE HERE FIT TO TALK TO
I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE DIMINUTIVE NOTE SOMEWHERE
AND THE REMEMBRANCE SHOT THROUGH HIM LIKE AN AGONY TILL IT MADE HIM CLENCH HIS HANDS TIGHT IN ORDER TO SUBDUE THE PAIN
D YE THINK I FORGET WHO'S LYING THERE AND HOW HOO LOVED YO
HOW PITIFUL EXCLAIMED MARGARET
BUT HERE WAS THIS MAN FROM A DISTANT COUNTY WHO WAS PERPLEXED BY THE WORKINGS OF THE SYSTEM INTO THE MIDST OF WHICH HE WAS THROWN AND EACH WAS EAGER TO MAKE HIM A JUDGE AND TO BRING WITNESS OF HIS OWN CAUSES FOR IRRITATION
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE
SHALL I GO TO MR LENNOX'S CHAMBERS AND TRY AND FIND HIM NO THANK YOU
NO MORE VARIETY OF LIGHT AND SHADE FOR HER IN THAT DARKENED ROOM
FOR WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO LONDON I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SO MUCH CHANGED
YOU MUST TRY AND WRITE TO ME IF I CAN EVER GIVE YOU ANY LITTLE HELP OR GOOD ADVICE
HE STOOD UNCERTAIN WITH DOGGED IRRESOLUTION UPON HIS FACE
I MUST SAID MARGARET DECIDEDLY
BUT THIS WAS ENOUGH TO WEAR OFF THE SHYNESS ON HER SIDE AND ANY SYMPTOMS OF MORTIFIED PRIDE AND VANITY ON HIS
YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY GOING WITHOUT MY SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS
HE PACED UP AND DOWN SETTING HIS TEETH A LITTLE NOW AND THEN
TO MAKE HER RICH WHITE SILK BALLOON OUT INTO A CHEESE TO RETREAT BACKWARDS FROM HER MOTHER AS IF SHE WERE THE QUEEN
THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE WOULD PERPETUALLY RECUR TO TROUBLE HIM IN VARIOUS SHAPES OF EXAGGERATION AND DISTORTION FROM THE SIMPLE TRUTH
HE MADE ALL SORTS OF TIPSY PROMISES BUT I'D SOMETHING ELSE TO DO THAN LISTEN TO HIM
WE HAVE AN OLD FAITHFUL SERVANT ALMOST A FRIEND WHO WANTS HELP BUT WHO IS VERY PARTICULAR
EDITH CHOSE TO DO MOST HERSELF
MR HALE POLITELY ENLIGHTENED HIM
MARGARET'S MANNER CHANGED INSTANTLY
IT DOES INDEED THEN I'LL KEEP IT TO MYSEL IF I BITE MY TONGUE OUT
I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
BUT HOW YOUR CHEEKS ARE FLUSHED WITH THE HEAT POOR CHILD
THERE WAS PERHAPS SO MUCH TRUTH IN THE SUSPICION AS THIS
I APPLY THE WORD TO ALL WHO HAVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO SELL
OH THOUGHT SHE I WISH I WERE A MAN THAT I COULD GO AND FORCE HIM TO EXPRESS HIS DISAPPROBATION AND TELL HIM HONESTLY THAT I KNEW I DESERVED IT
MARGARET LISTENED IN HORROR
VANITY
LITTLE FIRST-BORN CHILD COME TO ME ONCE AGAIN SHE WAS IN VIOLENT HYSTERICS
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HEAR FROM MR BELL TO-MORROW SAID MARGARET
THERE WILL BE SOME RISK NO DOUBT
DIXON QUITE INTENDS IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAMMA WOULD DO WITHOUT HER BUT WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF LIVING I AM AFRAID
COULD I DO WITHOUT IT IN SPEAKING OF THE THING IT REPRESENTS
AND IT IS SO LITTLE
THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE IN EDITH'S CASE HAD RUN REMARKABLY SMOOTH
HE WAS GRAVE AND ANXIOUS ONCE MORE
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LET ME SPEAK TO HIM MARGARET STILL LOOKED AT HIGGINS FOR HIS ANSWER
BUT THE SICKLY DAZE OF THE SWOON MADE HER STILL MISERABLY FAINT
FOR AFTER ALL THEY'VE GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHTS OF HOLDING AN INQUEST
WHAT BUSINESS HAD SHE A RENEGADE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER TO TURN UP HER NOSE AT YOU
HE HAD HOWEVER BEEN IN TO SEE MRS BOUCHER BEFORE STARTING ON HIS DAY'S BUSINESS WHATEVER THAT WAS
SHE EXERTED HERSELF TO FIND SUBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR CONVERSATION
AT LAST HE SAID
AT LAST HE SAID
AND MARGARET'S MOVEMENTS AND VOICE SEEMED AT ONCE RELEASED FROM SOME INVISIBLE CHAINS
HE FORCED EVERY MOVEMENT INTO UNNATURAL SLOWNESS AND DELIBERATION
SHE KNEW ENOUGH NOW TO UNDERSTAND MANY LOCAL INTERESTS--NAY EVEN SOME OF THE TECHNICAL WORDS EMPLOYED BY THE EAGER MILL-OWNERS
WHAT MADE HIM BE THE VERY MAGISTRATE SENT FOR TO RECEIVE LEONARDS DEPOSITION
STILL HIS DAUGHTER AND MARGARET DID NOT MOVE
DEAR PAPA
WE ARE DESOLATE
AND IF THERE WAS A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN MUCH OF WHAT SHE SAID
SHE HAD BEEN COWARDLY AND FALSE AND HAD SHOWN HER COWARDLINESS AND FALSEHOOD IN ACTION THAT COULD NOT BE RECALLED
SHE WAS THINKING HOW HER MOTHER'S DESIRE COULD BE FULFILLED
I WAS CIVIL
BUT EAST OR WEST WIND I SUPPOSE THIS MAN COMES OH MAMMA THAT SHOWS YOU NEVER SAW MR THORNTON
MARGARET CAME IN UPON THIS SCENE
I COULD BEAR THE SHAME--I THOUGHT I COULD AT LEAST
DO YOU THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY MESSAGE LEFT TO-DAY I WILL GO AND INQUIRE PAPA SAID MARGARET AFTER THE CHANGES ON THESE SENTENCES HAD BEEN RUNG ONCE OR TWICE
SHE DID NOT CATCH THE NAME
MARGARET TOOK UP THE CHILD AND PUT HIM INTO HER ARMS
MR THORNTON CALLED ALMOST DIRECTLY AFTER YOU LEFT
AND THE INSTANT SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT MARGARET'S PURPOSE WAS IN COMING TO SEE THEM SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SOB WITH SO LITTLE RESTRAINT THAT MARGARET FOUND IT USELESS TO SAY ANY OF THE THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS WHICH HAD SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO HER AS SHE WAS COMING ALONG IN THE COACH
THEN SILENTLY PUTTING IT INTO EDITH'S HANDS SHE LEFT THE ROOM
SHE WAS NOT IN SPIRITS TO RAISE HER FATHER'S TONE OF MIND
STAY I'LL RUN FETCH A PILLOW AND WE'LL LET HER DOWN EASY ON THE FLOOR THIS HELPFUL NEIGHBOUR WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO MARGARET
I DON'T EXPECT TO CONVINCE YOU IN A DAY,--NOT IN ONE CONVERSATION
HE'S HER BROTHER
EDITH WENT ABOUT ON TIP-TOE AND CHECKED SHOLTO IN ALL LOUD SPEAKING THAT NEXT MORNING AS IF ANY SUDDEN NOISE WOULD INTERRUPT THE CONFERENCE THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS A SPOILED CHILD SHE WAS TOO CARELESS AND IDLE TO HAVE A VERY STRONG WILL OF HER OWN AND GAVE WAY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HER MOTHER HAD ABSOLUTELY ORDERED THOSE EXTRA DELICACIES OF THE SEASON WHICH ARE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE EFFICACIOUS AGAINST IMMODERATE GRIEF AT FAREWELL DINNERS
HE HAD ADJUSTED HIS NECK-HANDKERCHIEF AND BORROWED AN ODD CANDLE-END TO POLISH HIS CLOGS WITH AND THERE HE SAT ENFORCING SOME OPINION ON HER FATHER WITH A STRONG DARKSHIRE ACCENT IT IS TRUE BUT WITH A LOWERED VOICE AND A GOOD EARNEST COMPOSURE ON HIS FACE
I'LL BE FINE ENOUGH IF THAT WILL SAVE ME FROM BEING LOOKED DOWN UPON IN MILTON I WISH I COULD SEE YOU DRESSED UP SAID BESSY
AND YET I YEARNED FOR CONVICTION
A STING AT MARGARET'S HEART MADE HER STRIVE TO LOOK OUT TO CATCH THE LAST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD CHURCH TOWER AT THE TURN WHERE SHE KNEW IT MIGHT BE SEEN ABOVE A WAVE OF THE FOREST TREES
NONE AT ALL
AND THAT'S A LESS SIN TO MY MIND TO MAKING MEN'S HEARTS SO HARD THAT THEY'LL NOT DO A KINDNESS TO THEM AS NEEDS IT OR HELP ON THE RIGHT AND JUST CAUSE THOUGH IT GOES AGAIN THE STRONG HAND
I'LL GO ON TRAMP TO-MORROW
I MUST DO WHAT MY CONSCIENCE BIDS
AND HOW DOES SHE TAKE HER GOOD FORTUNE OH IT SEEMS SHE KNEW SHE WAS TO HAVE IT ALL ALONG
AND HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNJUST IN GIVING SO SCORNFUL A HEARING TO ANY ONE WHO HAD WAITED WITH HUMBLE PATIENCE FOR FIVE HOURS TO SPEAK TO HIM
I AM VERY SELFISH SAID SHE
HE HAD NOT COME AS YET
IT NEVER WILL BE SETTLED IF THE IT IS WHAT I CONJECTURE YOU MEAN
AND THE IDEA CARRIED HER DOWN STAIRS INTO THE ROOM
NO I WILL NOT THOUGH SAID SHE SPRINGING TO HER FEET
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH MARGARET I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF THAT WOMAN GAVE HERSELF AIRS TO BE SURE SHE DOES PAPA REPLIED MARGARET
MARGARET WAS RED AS A ROSE WHEN MR THORNTON LOOKED AT HER
NOT MERELY THE SORROW BUT THE TERRIBLE DISCORD IN THE SORROW
SINCE THE ONE LONG CONVERSATION RELATING TO FREDERICK'S AFFAIRS WHICH SHE HAD WITH HIM THE FIRST EVENING IN MR BELL'S PRESENCE SHE HAD HAD NO GREAT INTERCOURSE WITH HIM FURTHER THAN THAT WHICH AROSE OUT OF THEIR CLOSE RELATIONS WITH THE SAME HOUSEHOLD
SO GO AND BE D D TO YO THERE'S NO WORK FOR YO HERE THEM'S BAD WORDS
MARGARET BATTLED HARD AGAINST THIS REGRET OF HERS FOR WHAT COULD NOT NOW BE HELPED
WHAT COULD YOU DO FOR HER MARGARET
BESSY TOSSED TO AND FRO
AND WHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM TO PAY THE LABOURERS WAGES THE NEXT STILL PUFFING AWAY
S
S
THEY'LL CRY TOGETHER AND COMFORT TOGETHER BETTER NOR ANY ONE BUT A CHILD CAN DO
MARGARET RATHER AGREED WITH HER THAT THE STORY WAS INCOHERENT ENOUGH TO BE LIKE A DREAM
FOR IN HESTON THERE HAD BEEN THE EARLIEST SIGNS OF FROST
THEN SHE READ IT AGAIN AND FORGETTING HERSELF WAS AMUSED AT ITS LIKENESS TO EDITH'S SELF AND WAS LAUGHING MERRILY OVER IT WHEN MRS HALE CAME INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM LEANING ON DIXON'S ARM
ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER THAT PROPERTY SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND THAT THE WILL OF THE PROPRIETOR MIGHT CUT TO HIS END CLEAN AND SHARP AS A SWORD
NOW FORCING ITSELF ON THEIR ATTENTION
BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE LIKE YOUR MOTHER FOR BEAUTY--NEVER
MARY WAS HUMBLY SOBBING IN THE BACK-GROUND
BUT SHE SPOKE WITH AN AIR OF COMMAND AS SHE ASKED WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MAMMA
AND IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THEIR CHANCE ALONG WI TH REST TH UNION HAS WAYS AND MEANS MR HALE SAW THAT HIGGINS WAS VEXED AT THE TURN THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN AND WAS SILENT
MRS BOUCHER WAS DYING
DIXON HAD ALWAYS CONSIDERED MR HALE AS THE BLIGHT WHICH HAD FALLEN UPON HER YOUNG LADY'S PROSPECTS IN LIFE
GOD HELP EM
SHE IS TOO PERFECT TO BE KNOWN BY FRAGMENTS
OH JOHN--HUSBAND MARGARET SAVED HER FROM FALLING BY CATCHING HER IN HER ARMS
I KNOW HE IS GOOD OF HIS KIND AND BY AND BY I SHALL LIKE THE KIND
FOR HE IS SURE TO COME
I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO-NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
HOW IS MISS HALE SHE ASKED
DO YOU KNOW THESE ROSES HE SAID DRAWING OUT HIS POCKET-BOOK IN WHICH WERE TREASURED UP SOME DEAD FLOWERS
I LIVED THERE FOR SOME YEARS
IT GAVE HER THAT LENGTH OF OBLIVION FROM THE KEEN SHARPNESS OF THE RECOLLECTION OF THE ACTUAL BUSINESS IN HAND
SO WE--THAT IS HE AND I,--WENT TO THE RAILWAY STATION
WILL YOU TAKE WORK WITH ME
BUT IF I'VE TIME I SHALL GO ROUND BY CRAMPTON AFTER I'VE ARRANGED WITH THE POLICE AND SEEN HAMPER AND CLARKSON THEIR EYES MET
NOR DO I ADMIRE THOSE WHIRLIGIG CHARACTERS THAT ARE FULL OF THIS THING TO-DAY TO BE UTTERLY FORGETFUL OF IT IN THEIR NEW INTEREST TO-MORROW
HIS EYES WERE DRY AND FIERCE
SHE'S BED-FAST BUT SHE WERE RAVING AND RAGING TO KNOW WHERE HER DUNDER-HEADED BRUTE OF A CHAP WAS AS IF I'D TO KEEP HIM--AS IF HE WERE FIT TO BE RULED BY ME
VERY GRAY AND STERN DID MR THORNTON LOOK AS HE PASSED OUT THROUGH HIS WONDERING CLERKS
AND YET HER HEART LEAPT UP LIGHT TO KNOW HE WAS HER OWN AGAIN
SO I OUGHT NOT TO COMPLAIN OF YOUR TURNING THE SIMILE INTO A WEAPON AGAINST ME
SHE ASKED MARGARET IF SHE REMEMBERED THE DAY TWELVE-MONTH ON WHICH SHE EDITH WROTE--HOW IT RAINED ALL DAY LONG IN HARLEY STREET
JUST ONE TURN SAID MARGARET PUTTING HER ARM ROUND MRS HALE'S WAIST
BUT INSTEAD OF A SMILE THE WAN LIPS RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO A SIGH
AND THEN TO MAKE SECURITY MOST SURE AT MRS HALE'S OWN BIDDING TOOK IT HERSELF TO THE POST-OFFICE
BUT NOW I'VE HAD MANY DAYS O IDLENESS AND I'M JUST AS WEARY O THEM AS I WAS O MY WORK
BUT IF EVER HE GETS WELL O'ER THIS CLEMMING AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION HE AND I'LL HAVE AN UP AND DOWN FIGHT PURRING AN A AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HIM AND SO FATHER SHOOK ME OFF,--FOR INDEED I WAS LOW AND FAINT ENOUGH AND HIS FACE WAS ALL CLAY WHITE WHERE IT WEREN'T BLOODY AND TURNED ME SICK TO LOOK AT
NO SAID MARGARET
IF THERE WAS AN INQUEST AND THE YOUNG MAN CAME FORWARD
AND I HOPE YOU NOTICED THE HAPPY CHOICE OF HER EXPRESSIONS
SHE HEARD HIM TALKING AS IF TO HIMSELF
AND YET THOUGH EVERY LEAF MAY SEEM STILL THERE IS A CONTINUAL RUSHING SOUND OF MOVEMENT ALL AROUND--NOT CLOSE AT HAND
POOR MARGARET
POOR MARGARET
AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
FREDERICK CAME BRISKLY IN WITH A FORCED CHEERFULNESS GRASPED HER HAND LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND BURST INTO TEARS
SHE PUT ASIDE DIXON
HOO'S A DEAL TOO MUCH SET ON PEACE AND QUIETNESS AT ANY PRICE THIS IS TH THIRD STRIKE I'VE SEEN SAID SHE SIGHING AS IF THAT WAS ANSWER AND EXPLANATION ENOUGH
SHE'S NOT DEAD
BUT HE MUST HAVE TRANSACTED HIS BUSINESS BY WRITING MARGARET THOUGHT ERE NOW AND SHE KNEW THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD AVOID GOING TO A PLACE WHICH HE DISLIKED AND MOREOVER WOULD LITTLE UNDERSTAND THE SECRET IMPORTANCE WHICH SHE AFFIXED TO THE EXPLANATION THAT COULD ONLY BE GIVEN BY WORD OF MOUTH
POOR LITTLE SUSAN
AND PERHAPS HE NEVER WOULD BUT FOR THE LIE,--WHICH UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAINTAIN WAS NECESSARY IT WAS NOT
BUT WHEN HER AUNT RELUCTANTLY PROPOSED A FEW DAYS DELAY TO MARGARET THE LATTER WRITHED HER BODY AS IF IN ACUTE SUFFERING AND SAID
I AM CONSTANTLY WANTING YOU TO DRAW HIM FOR ME MARGARET
MINE ARE WORKING OUT THEIR WEEK THROUGH FEAR OF BEING PROSECUTED FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT
I SAY NOTHING OF THE TASTE WHICH COULD CHOOSE THE TIME WHEN HER MOTHER LAY UNBURIED FOR SUCH A PROMENADE
HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN TEACHING HER OF WHAT ALL THESE MYSTERIES OF THE LAW WERE THE SIGNS AND TYPES
THEN THE LITTLE MARGARET HAD HUSHED HER SOBS AND TRIED TO LIE QUIET AS IF ASLEEP FOR FEAR OF MAKING HER FATHER UNHAPPY BY HER GRIEF WHICH SHE DARED NOT EXPRESS BEFORE HER AUNT AND WHICH SHE RATHER THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG TO FEEL AT ALL AFTER THE LONG HOPING AND PLANNING AND CONTRIVING THEY HAD GONE THROUGH AT HOME BEFORE HER WARDROBE COULD BE ARRANGED SO AS TO SUIT HER GRANDER CIRCUMSTANCES AND BEFORE PAPA COULD LEAVE HIS PARISH TO COME UP TO LONDON EVEN FOR A FEW DAYS
STILL IT WAS THE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY OF EXPLAINING HIS MEANING
AND IT WAS NO THOUGHT OF HER SON OR OF HER LIVING DAUGHTER FANNY THAT STIRRED HER HEART AT LAST
DID YOU SEND FOR HIM NO PAPA YOU SPOKE OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME
I DUNNO
HE WAS SO STEADY AT HIS WORK THAT MARGARET DID NOT OFTEN SEE HIM DURING THESE WINTER MONTHS
I WAS JUST THINKING--BUT WILL YOU RUN THE RISK OF DINNER
WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN OH SAID HER FATHER SOME OF THEM REALLY SEEM TO BE FINE FELLOWS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY A MAN AT OXFORD IS
PRODUCED BY CHARLES ALDARONDO NORTH AND SOUTH BY ELIZABETH GASKELL FIRST PUBLISHED IN SERIAL FORM IN HOUSEHOLD WORDS IN 1854-1855 AND IN VOLUME FORM IN 1855
HE'S BEEN ALL THIS DAY WITH POOR MISSUS
MARGARET COULD NOT HELP HER LOOKS
SHE KISSED HER FATHER AND GLIDED DOWN STAIRS WITH A RAPIDITY OF MOTION OF WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER CAPABLE WHO HAD SEEN HER THE MINUTE BEFORE
TO BEGIN WITH SHE CALLED IN MARTHA AS SHE PASSED THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR IN GOING UP-STAIRS AND TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS BELOW THE GRAVE RESPECTFUL SERVANT-LIKE MANNER WHICH CRUSTED OVER HER INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER WITH AN OBEDIENCE THAT WAS ALMOST MECHANICAL
AND TO-MORROW THAT LOOK WHICH HAS ALARMED YOU SO MUCH WILL HAVE PASSED AWAY BUT NOT THE DISEASE DR DONALDSON GLANCED AT MARGARET
WHO SOUGHT THEM OUT AND THOUGHT FOR THEM AND CARED FOR THEM
AND EDITH HAD INHERITED THIS CHARMING DOMESTIC QUALITY
HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO
SHE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY ANNOYED AT MARGARET'S WAY OF BEHAVING
IF THEY CAME SORROWING AND WANTING SYMPATHY IN A COMPLICATED TROUBLE LIKE THE PRESENT THEN THEY WOULD BE FELT AS A SHADOW IN ALL THESE HOUSES OF INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES NOT FRIENDS
HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HER--OR HELSTONE EITHER--ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ROAMING AMONG DISTANT COUNTRIES AND FOREIGN PEOPLE
SPECIAL IF YO REMEMBER MY MANNER O TALK YESTERDAY
BUT IT SEEMED CHILDISH TO RELINQUISH A PLAN WHICH I HAD ONCE THOUGHT WISE AND WELL-LAID JUST BECAUSE I MYSELF DID NOT RECEIVE ALL THE HONOUR AND CONSEQUENCE DUE TO THE ORIGINATOR
HOO'S RATHER DOWN I TH MOUTH IN REGARD TO SPIRITS BUT HOO'S BETTER IN HEALTH
AN TH UNION,--THAT'S TO SAY I--WILL TAKE CARE YO'VE ENOUGH FOR TH CHILDER AND TH MISSUS
I DON'T CARE IF I AM HIS MOTHER
BEFORE YOU HAVE BEEN AT CHURCH BUT TO-DAY IS MY ONLY DAY
SHE PRESSED MRS HALE'S SOFT LANGUID HAND
SHE SEEMED CONTINUALLY ON THE POINT OF WEEPING
I'M NOT NESH MYSEL WHEN I'M PUT OUT
TAKE CARE TO GIVE THIS NOTE TO WATSON HE CALLS THE NOTE CONTAINED THESE WORDS
ARE YOU GOING OUT
BUT AT LAST SHE DETERMINED TO TAKE HER MIND AWAY FROM THE PRESENT
THE HEAVY SMOKY AIR HUNG ABOUT HER BEDROOM WHICH OCCUPIED THE LONG NARROW PROJECTION AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
SHE LAY DOWN AND NEVER STIRRED
NO MEAN BRICK SHALL BE A SPECIMEN OF THE BUILDING OF MY PALACE CHAPTER XXXII MISCHANCES WHAT
WHAT DID LEONARDS LOOK LIKE A BAD-LOOKING FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU MISS
SHE HAD FOUND IT OCCASIONALLY TIRESOME WHILE IT LASTED
WHY HE WOULD BE WANTING HER TO CALL ON FANNY'S DANCING-MASTER'S WIFE THE NEXT THING AND SO I WOULD MOTHER IF MR MASON AND HIS WIFE WERE FRIENDLESS IN A STRANGE PLACE LIKE THE HALES OH
I'D HAVE HAD EVERY ONE OF THEM UP AND PUNISHED FOR IT THAT LEFT HIS WORK BEFORE HIS TIME WAS OUT THE LAW EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THE HANDS THEM SELVES WERE WORTH--A SET OF UNGRATEFUL NAUGHTS SAID HIS MOTHER
AND MARGARET'S PASSION AT ONCE MOLLIFIED HER VISITOR FAR MORE THAN ANY SILENCE OR RESERVE COULD HAVE DONE
HE HAS USED ARGUMENTS AND EXPOSTULATIONS ALL IN VAIN--IN VAIN
HE KEEPS OUT OF OUR WAY EVIDENTLY
MR HALE SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING OF THE MERITS OF THE FEATHERBEDS OF FORMER DAYS MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACTIVITY OF YOUTH WHICH GAVE A RELISH TO REST
I WILL,--IF YO'RE LEADING ME ASTRAY I THIS MATTER
YET THERE WERE OTHER SAYINGS OF THEIRS WHICH WHEN SHE REACHED THE QUIET SAFETY OF HOME AMUSED HER EVEN WHILE THEY IRRITATED HER
ON SOME FUTURE DAY--IN SOME MILLENNIUM--IN UTOPIA THIS UNITY MAY BE BROUGHT INTO PRACTICE--JUST AS I CAN FANCY A REPUBLIC THE MOST PERFECT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WE WILL READ PLATO'S REPUBLIC AS SOON AS WE HAVE FINISHED HOMER WELL IN THE PLATONIC YEAR IT MAY FALL OUT THAT WE ARE ALL--MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN--FIT FOR A REPUBLIC
BUT HAD NOT SHE IN HER DESPAIRING DOUBTS NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE SHOWN HERSELF A FAR MORE UTTER SCEPTIC
HE ONLY SURVIVED FOR A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS AND THE INDIGNATION OF THE SHIP'S CREW WAS AT BOILING POINT WHEN YOUNG HALE WROTE
BUT YOU MUST LET ME NURSE YOU NOW HE MADE HER LIE DOWN ON THE SOFA AND WENT FOR A SHAWL TO COVER HER WITH
AND THAT WAS DEATH
MARGARET WAS SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND THE REST OF THE GENTLEMEN--ALL MILTON MEN,--WERE GIVING HIM ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS
MAYN'T I UNFASTEN YOUR GOWN MISS AND DO YOUR HAIR NO
IF WE CAN'T WE MAY SHUT UP SHOP AT ONCE AND HANDS AND MASTERS GO ALIKE ON TRAMP
OH I PRAY THEE MY GOD THAT HER SUFFERINGS MAY NOT BE TOO ACUTE TOO DREADFUL
HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO-MORROW
HE WAS SICK ENOUGH O LIVING CHOOSE WHAT CAUSE HE HAD FOR IT HIGGINS CREPT UP TO MARGARET'S SIDE AND SAID IN A WEAK PIPING KIND OF VOICE
ONCE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE MAN TO MAN WITH AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE MASSES AROUND HIM AND TAKE NOTICE OUT OF THE CHARACTER OF MASTER AND WORKMAN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THEY HAD EACH BEGUN TO RECOGNISE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF US ONE HUMAN HEART IT WAS THE FINE POINT OF THE WEDGE
HE'S A RARE GOOD MAN IS FATHER--BUT OH SAID SHE FALLING BACK IN DESPAIR WHAT HE SAYS AT TIMES MAKES ME LONG TO DIE MORE THAN EVER FOR I WANT TO KNOW SO MANY THINGS AND AM SO TOSSED ABOUT WI WONDER POOR WENCH--POOR OLD WENCH,--I'M LOTH TO VEX THEE I AM
IT WAS ONLY A NATURAL INSTINCT
HE THOUGHT GOD COULD NA BE HARDER THAN MEN
AND NOW CHASTENED EVEN BY WHAT THE WORLD CALLED HER GOOD FORTUNE SHE CHARMED HER RELUCTANT AUNT INTO ACQUIESCENCE WITH HER WILL
AND IN YO'R PREACHING DID YO STOP EVERY NOW AND THEN AND SAY HALF TO THEM AND HALF TO YO'RSEL BUT YO'RE SUCH A PACK O FOOLS THAT I'VE A STRONG NOTION IT'S NO USE MY TRYING TO PUT SENSE INTO YO I WERE NOT I TH BEST STATE I'LL OWN FOR TAKING IN WHAT HAMPER'S FRIEND HAD TO SAY--I WERE SO VEXED AT THE WAY IT WERE PUT TO ME;--BUT I THOUGHT COME I'LL SEE WHAT THESE CHAPS HAS GOT TO SAY AND TRY IF IT'S THEM OR ME AS IS TH NOODLE SO I TOOK TH BOOK AND TUGGED AT IT
BUT HE WENT AND OPENED THE SHUTTERS AND LET THE RUDDY LIGHT OF DAWN FLOOD THE ROOM
MARGARET BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER ALL OFFERS WERE AS UNEXPECTED BEFOREHAND,--AS DISTRESSING AT THE TIME OF THEIR OCCURRENCE AS THE TWO SHE HAD HAD
I TELLED HIM I'D NOT THAT GOOD OPINION ON HIM THAT I'D HA COME A SECOND TIME OF MYSEL
BUT SHE WRUNG HIS HAND AT PARTING
SHE HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TWO DAYS
THAT I BELIEVE IS A PROPER EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY I DON'T KNOW
FOR JUST BY THAT VERY POST I MAY MISS HIM BUT MAMMA PAPA IS OUT PAPA IS OUT
DID SHE NOT REMEMBER EVERY WEATHER-STAIN ON THE OLD STONE WALL
I SHALL HATE THIS TOWN AND MYSELF TOO IF SHE PRAY MARGARET DOES YOUR MOTHER OFTEN TALK TO YOU OF THE OLD PLACES OF HELSTONE I MEAN NO PAPA SAID MARGARET SADLY
YOUR WAY OF SPEAKING SHOCKS ME
SOMETHING ALMOST PITIFUL TO SEE IN A MAN'S FACE
WHERE'S THE PEARL
ON MARGARET'S RETURN HOME SHE FOUND TWO LETTERS ON THE TABLE
CAPTAIN LENNOX AND MR THORNTON ARE HERE
HOW DID YOU MANAGE MISS HALE WITHOUT A NURSERY WE WERE BUT TWO SAID MARGARET
AND REPEATING ALL THE NOBLE VERSES OF HOLY COMFORT OR TEXTS EXPRESSIVE OF FAITHFUL RESIGNATION THAT SHE COULD REMEMBER
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT I AM PENITENT HE ANSWERED
SHE TOOK HER WORK AND SATE DOWN VERY QUIET AND SILENT
COME TO MAMMA AND DO ASK HER BEFORE YOU GO
BUT MY MOTHER KNOWS I AM COMING OH
YET HER HEAD WAS DOWN OVER THE BOOK
EVERY MAN'S FACE WAS SET IN LINES OF EAGERNESS OR ANXIETY
AND MORE FROM A DESIRE TO SHOW HER GRATITUDE FOR THIS THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON SHE ROUSED HERSELF UP AND SMILED IN ANSWER TO DIXON'S ANXIOUS LOOK AT HER
HIS EYES GLOWED HIS FIGURE WAS DILATED HIS BREATH CAME THICK AND FAST
AND I THINK IF THIS SHOULD BE TH END OF ALL AND IF ALL I'VE BEEN BORN FOR IS JUST TO WORK MY HEART AND MY LIFE AWAY AND TO SICKEN I THIS DREE PLACE WI THEM MILL-NOISES IN MY EARS FOR EVER UNTIL I COULD SCREAM OUT FOR THEM TO STOP AND LET ME HAVE A LITTLE PIECE O QUIET--AND WI THE FLUFF FILLING MY LUNGS UNTIL I THIRST TO DEATH FOR ONE LONG DEEP BREATH O THE CLEAR AIR YO SPEAK ON--AND MY MOTHER GONE AND I NEVER ABLE TO TELL HER AGAIN HOW I LOVED HER AND O ALL MY TROUBLES--I THINK IF THIS LIFE IS TH END AND THAT THERE'S NO GOD TO WIPE AWAY ALL TEARS FROM ALL EYES--YO WENCH YO SAID SHE SITTING UP AND CLUTCHING VIOLENTLY ALMOST FIERCELY AT MARGARET'S HAND I COULD GO MAD AND KILL YO I COULD SHE FELL BACK COMPLETELY WORN OUT WITH HER PASSION
HE WAS DEPRESSED AND SAD AT THIS PARTIAL CESSATION OF AN INTERCOURSE WHICH HAD BECOME DEAR TO HIM
IF HER MOTHER IS SO ILL AS YOU TOLD ME ON THE WAY HERE IT MAY BE VERY SERIOUS IF SHE HEARS OF THIS RIOT AND DOES NOT SEE HER DAUGHTER BACK AT THE TIME SHE EXPECTS
BUT YO DUNNOT KNOW WHAT A STRIKE IS YET COME BESSY SAID MARGARET I WON'T SAY YOU'RE EXAGGERATING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF CLAIM UPON HER
THAT WAS THE BLUNDER IT WAS NO BLUNDER SAID MARGARET GLOOMILY
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HIM I DON'T KNOW
CHAPTER XXVI MOTHER AND SON I HAVE FOUND THAT HOLY PLACE OF REST STILL CHANGELESS MRS
IT WAS THE PARADISO OF DANTE IN THE PROPER OLD ITALIAN BINDING OF WHITE VELLUM AND GOLD
LET NOT YOUR HEART BE TROUBLED IT SAID
SOME FIERCE WITH ANGER SOME LOWERING WITH RELENTLESS THREATS SOME DILATED WITH FEAR OR IMPLORING ENTREATY
DID I GIVE THEM TO YOU NO
CLASSICS MAY DO VERY WELL FOR MEN WHO LOITER AWAY THEIR LIVES IN THE COUNTRY OR IN COLLEGES
BUT THERE'S ONE COMFORT ON YOUR OWN SHOWING
I WILL TRY AND WRITE MYSELF SHE SAT UP TREMBLING ALL OVER WITH FEVERISH EAGERNESS
I AM GOING TO BRACY COMMON AND WILL ASK FARMER DOBSON TO GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR DINNER
HIM AS WENT AND DROWNDED HIMSELF POOR CHAP
PAPA LIKES MR LENNOX
THAT'S A BUT WE OWE HER MANY THANKS FOR HER KIND SERVICE BEGAN MR HALE AGAIN
ONLY SHE USED TO STOP AT HOME WITH YOU YES SHE DID
I HEARD MOREOVER THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MASTERS TO HAVE IGNORANT WORKMEN--NOT HEDGE-LAWYERS AS CAPTAIN LENNOX USED TO CALL THOSE MEN IN HIS COMPANY WHO QUESTIONED AND WOULD KNOW THE REASON FOR EVERY ORDER THIS LATTER PART OF HER SENTENCE SHE ADDRESSED RATHER TO HER FATHER THAN TO MR THORNTON
MISS HALE HAVE YOU NO EXPLANATION TO GIVE ME
YOU MIGHT HAVE TOLD ME WHO SHE WAS
I'D DIG THE GROUND AND GROW POTATOES
MARGARET WOULD NOT BE ALONE
LOYALTY AND OBEDIENCE TO WISDOM AND JUSTICE ARE FINE
EVERY NOW AND THEN THE WIND SEEMED TO BEAR THE DISTANT MULTITUDINOUS SOUND NEARER
AND OF THINKING HER OWN THOUGHTS WHILE SHE RESTED INSTEAD OF ANXIOUSLY WATCHING ANOTHER PERSON TO LEARN WHETHER TO BE GRAVE OR GAY
YOU WISH ME TO BE A FRIEND TO MISS HALE SAID MRS THORNTON IN HER MEASURED VOICE THAT WOULD NOT SOFTEN WITH HER HEART BUT CAME OUT DISTINCT AND CLEAR
FOR WHERE'ER HE IS AND WHATE'ER HE'LL NE'ER KNOW OTHER CLEMMING OR COLD AGAIN
BUT AT THE END THEY WILL FIND I HAVE NOT BATED NOR ALTERED ONE JOT MARGARET HAD RE-ENTERED THE ROOM AND WAS SITTING AT HER WORK
IS ANYTHING THE MATTER NO NOTHING
I AM GOING TO CONSULT MR LENNOX AS TO THE CHANCE OF EXCULPATING MYSELF SO THAT I MAY RETURN TO ENGLAND WHENEVER I CHOOSE MORE FOR YOUR SAKE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF ANY ONE ELSE
YOU COULD LEARN MORE BY HALF AN HOUR'S CONVERSATION WITH MR HENRY LENNOX ABOUT FREDERICK'S CHANCES THAN IN A DOZEN OF THESE LETTERS OF HIS
AND PASSED IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM IN A GLAD RESTLESSNESS THAT COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH SITTING STILL
MR HALE BLEW HIS NOSE AND GOT UP TO SNUFF THE CANDLES IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS EMOTION
I MEAN IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE ADVICE
MARGARET KNEW THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE REMOVING
TELL MAMMA SARAH SAID SHE
SHE HAD NOT MUCH IN IT OF WHAT SHE COULD CALL HER OWN BUT WHAT SHE HAD SHE PUT INTO BESSY'S HAND WITHOUT SPEAKING
BUT THE CHAP NE'ER STOPPED DRIVING THE PLOUGH I'SE WARRANT FOR ALL HE WERE PITIFUL ABOUT THE DAISY
IT MIGHT BE BUT A WILL-O'-TH'-WISP BUT HE THOUGHT HE WOULD FOLLOW IT AND ASCERTAIN WHITHER IT WOULD LEAD HIM
MARGARET DON'T DESPISE ME
BUT IT WAS NO USE
MANY AND MANY A ONE HERE
YOU KNOW HE HAD SEEN ME CLOSE TO THE STATION
AND THEN SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AND WENT ON IN HER NATURAL MANNER
TO MARLBOROUGH MILLS I SUPPOSE SIR NO MR THORNTON SAID
AND THEN SUDDENLY MADE THE PLUNGE
HE MIGHT BE THE WISEST OF MEN OR THE MOST POWERFUL--I SHOULD EQUALLY REBEL AND RESENT HIS INTERFERENCE I IMAGINE THIS IS A STRONGER FEELING IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THAT IN THE SOUTH I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT IS NOT THAT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN NONE OF THE EQUALITY OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE ADVISER AND ADVISED CLASSES
I WANTED HIM TO HAVE BEEN CALLED BERESFORD TO WHICH HE HAD A KIND OF RIGHT BUT YOUR FATHER THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER NOT
AND INDEED IN ALL HIS LITTLE PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE ORPHAN CHILDREN NICHOLAS SHOWED A SOBER JUDGMENT AND REGULATED METHOD OF THINKING WHICH WERE AT VARIANCE WITH HIS FORMER MORE ECCENTRIC JERKS OF ACTION
THE WINDOW-CURTAINS WERE LACE
HE COULD NOT END HIS SENTENCE
I ASK YOUR PARDON
I WISH YOU COULD GET HIM TO THINK OF THE CADIZ PLAN FOR MANY REASONS
IF YOU ARE I'M VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU I'M BUILDING A DINING-ROOM--FOR THE MEN I MEAN--THE HANDS I THOUGHT YOU WERE HARD TO PLEASE IF THIS ROOM WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU A BACHELOR I'VE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH A STRANGE KIND OF CHAP AND I PUT ONE OR TWO CHILDREN IN WHOM HE IS INTERESTED TO SCHOOL
THEY ALL COULD HEAR THE ONE GREAT STRAINING BREATH
BUT IT WAS RENDERED FATAL THE DOCTORS SAY BY THE PRESENCE OF SOME INTERNAL COMPLAINT AND THE MAN'S OWN HABIT OF DRINKING THE LARGE DARK EYES GAZING STRAIGHT INTO THE INSPECTOR'S FACE DILATED A LITTLE
SHE WAS SURE SHE WOULD MAKE HERSELF DEADLY ILL IF SHE WENT ON AT THAT RATE
I THINK AFTER THIS EVENING WE SHALL FEEL AT REST WHICH I AM SURE I HAVE NOT DONE FOR MANY WEEKS
I ONLY SAY TAKE CARE
SHE LOOKS VERY WHITE AND PALE AND SAYS SHE'S AFRAID OF IT
IT MIGHT OR IT MIGHT NOT
AS FAR AS THEY DEFIED HIS ROCK-LIKE POWER OF CHARACTER HIS PASSION-STRENGTH HE SEEMED TO THROW THEM OFF FROM HIM WITH CONTEMPT UNTIL SHE FELT THE WEARINESS OF THE EXERTION OF MAKING USELESS PROTESTS
I'VE TURNED OFF UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED OF MY BEST HANDS FOR NO OTHER FAULT THAN FOLLOWING YOU AND SUCH AS YOU
FOR HE RATHER LIKED IT AS LONG AS MARGARET WOULD TALK ALTHOUGH WHAT SHE SAID ONLY IRRITATED HIM
I'M BUT AN AILING CREATURE MYSEL'--I'VE BEEN AILING THIS LONG TIME BUT HE IS DEAD--HE IS DROWNED FOLK ARE BROUGHT ROUND AFTER THEY'RE DEAD-DROWNED
MARLBOROUGH MILLS AND THE ADJACENT DWELLING WERE HELD UNDER A LONG LEASE
I AM SICK WITH THE THOUGHT THAT LEONARDS MAY BE IN THE SAME TRAIN WITH YOU
THOUGH BY G HE DESERVES IT AND I SHOULD NA HA MINDED IF SOME ONE ELSE HAD DONE THE DIRTY WORK AND GOT HIM CLAPPED UP
I SHOULDN'T ADVISE YOU TO STAY IN MILTON
HE KNOWS IT HIMSELF
I WISH YOU'D GIVE ME CARTE-BLANCHE FOR ALL MY PATIENTS AND ALL THEIR WANTS BUT MR THORNTON HAD NO GENERAL BENEVOLENCE,--NO UNIVERSAL PHILANTHROPY
HE CAME ROUND BEHIND HER SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIS LOOKS AND BENDING BACK HER GRAY STONY FACE HE KISSED IT MURMURING
I SHALL NOT BE TEN MINUTES AWAY COULDN'T HANNAH GO MA'AM WHY HANNAH
MARGARET WAS BUSY EMBROIDERING A SMALL PIECE OF CAMBRIC FOR SOME LITTLE ARTICLE OF DRESS FOR EDITH'S EXPECTED BABY--'FLIMSY USELESS WORK AS MRS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF
HE HAD SHAKEN OFF HIS EMOTION AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER GIVEN WAY TO IT
MR HALE HURRIEDLY SAID--'GO MARGARET GO
I DO NOT KNOW--I MAY BE WRONG--ONLY BUT HE WAS GONE
A SHARP PEBBLE FLEW BY HER GRAZING FOREHEAD AND CHEEK AND DRAWING A BLINDING SHEET OF LIGHT BEFORE HER EYES
WHAT A SCOWL HE HAS SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO VEX HIM SAID MARGARET APOLOGETICALLY
THE MIDDLE WINDOW IN THE BOW WAS OPENED AND CLUSTERING ROSES AND THE SCARLET HONEYSUCKLE CAME PEEPING ROUND THE CORNER
BUT SHE HAD NEVER PLEADED IN VAIN
SO SHE REPLIED RATHER SHORTLY
ONLY IT'S DULL ENOUGH TO SIT IN A ROOM WHERE EVERYTHING SPEAKS TO YOU OF A DEAD FRIEND
AND YET HE COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT RECOLLECT THE CAUSE OF HIS SUFFERING AND WHETHER IT WAS ADEQUATE TO THE CONSEQUENCES IT HAD PRODUCED
SHE HAD NO DOUBT OF THAT
BUT SHE KNEW THEM NOT
SHE DID NOT LOOK UP
LISTEN SHE DID LISTEN
BUT THIS TIME WE'N LAID OUR PLANS DESPERATE DEEP WHY DO YOU STRIKE ASKED MARGARET
WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES
IT'S NOT DEATH YET
MARGARET NOT SO PASSIONATE AT FIRST WAS MORE SUFFERING NOW
SHE HID HERSELF ONCE MORE IN THE LADIES WAITING-ROOM AND FANCIED EVERY NOISE WAS LEONARDS STEP--EVERY LOUD AND BOISTEROUS VOICE WAS HIS
A CLOG WHIZZED THROUGH THE AIR
A CLEVER LENNOX THE CAPTAIN'S A FOOL YOU MUST UNDERSTAND A YOUNG BARRISTER WHO WILL BE SETTING HIS CAP AT MARGARET
AND I AM GLAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY OWN OBLIGATION FOR ANY KINDNESS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HER
IF SHE HAD BEEN A MILTON LASS MRS THORNTON WOULD HAVE POSITIVELY LIKED HER
SHE WAS REALLY VERY FOND OF HIM EXCEPTING WHEN HE WAS ANXIOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO EDITH'S DRESS AND APPEARANCE WITH A VIEW TO HER BEAUTY MAKING A SUFFICIENT IMPRESSION ON THE WORLD
FOLK AT HELSTONE WERE NEVER BROUGHT HIGHER THAN THE KITCHEN
DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM--HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
NO ONE NOT EVEN DR DONALDSON KNEW HOW THE TIME WENT BY
TO YOUR QUESTION
BUT THE TREES WERE GORGEOUS IN THEIR AUTUMNAL LEAFINESS--THE WARM ODOURS OF FLOWER AND HERB CAME SWEET UPON THE SENSE--THE YOUNG WIFE MOVED ABOUT HER HOUSE WITH JUST THAT MIXTURE OF ANNOYANCE AT HER POSITION AS REGARDED WEALTH WITH PRIDE IN HER HANDSOME AND DEVOTED HUSBAND WHICH MR BELL HAD NOTICED IN REAL LIFE A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO
AND AS YOU FELT THE BAD UP HERE I THOUGHT IT WAS BUT FAIR YOU SHOULD KNOW THE BAD DOWN THERE AND YO SAY THEY NEVER STRIKE DOWN THERE ASKED NICHOLAS ABRUPTLY
THEN SHE WENT AND OPENED THE DOOR WITH A SORT OF IMPETUOUS WISH TO SHAKE OFF THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST HOUR IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS OR IN ACTIVE EXERTION
AT BREAKFAST TIME THE NEXT DAY SHE EXPRESSED HER WISH TO GO AND BID ONE OR TWO FRIENDS GOOD-BYE
AND FATHER--ALL MEN--HAVE IT STRONGER IN EM THAN ME TO GET TIRED O SAMENESS AND WORK FOR EVER
TO SAY IT WAS THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD THINK OF TO KEEP HIM FROM THE GIN-PALACE
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS NOTE MARGARET MADE NO MORE ENQUIRIES ABOUT HIS HEALTH
MR THORNTON WAS ANNOYED MORE THAN HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN AT ALL THAT MR BELL WAS SAYING
PARTLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS AND PARTLY OWING TO ONE OF THE VERY COMMON MISTAKES IN THE RAILWAY GUIDE AS TO THE TIMES WHEN TRAINS ARRIVE AT THE SMALLER STATIONS THEY FOUND ON REACHING OUTWOOD THAT THEY HAD NEARLY TWENTY MINUTES TO SPARE
BUT I AM TRYING TO RECONCILE YOUR ADMIRATION OF DESPOTISM WITH YOUR RESPECT FOR OTHER MEN'S INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER HE REDDENED AT HER TONE
THEN EVERYBODY GOT DOWN
AND THE LATTER KEPT ON SITTING OVER THE FIRE AND TALKING WEARILY LONG AFTER ALL BUSINESS WAS TRANSACTED AND WHEN THEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE GONE UPSTAIRS
OH FATHER FATHER SAID MARY THROWING HERSELF UPON HIS ARM,--'NOT TO-NIGHT
AND SHORTLY TEARS STOLE OUT BETWEEN HIS GRIZZLED EYE-LASHES AT THE FEELING OF WHICH HE OPENED HIS KEEN EYES AND LOOKED AS SEVERELY CHEERFUL AS HIS SET DETERMINATION COULD MAKE HIM
TRADE OR NO TRADE FREDERICK WAS VERY VERY HAPPY
I WENT INTO THE STUDY JUST NOW AND HE HAD HIS FACE ON THE TABLE COVERING IT WITH HIS HANDS
THE MOONLIGHT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO LET HIM SEE HIS DAUGHTER IN HER UNUSUAL PLACE AND ATTITUDE
THE ELDER CHILDREN WERE AT HUMBLE SCHOOLS THE YOUNGER ONES WERE TENDED IN MARY'S ABSENCE AT HER WORK BY THE KIND NEIGHBOUR WHOSE GOOD SENSE HAD STRUCK MARGARET AT THE TIME OF BOUCHER'S DEATH
HIS CLERK SAID THAT HE WOULD RETURN BY THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AT THE LATEST
HE SPOKE OF A BOOK YESTERDAY WHICH HE HAD AND WHICH I WANTED TO SEE
THE WINDOWS WERE HALF OPEN BECAUSE OF THE HEAT AND THE VENETIAN BLINDS COVERED THE GLASS,--SO THAT A GRAY GRIM LIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE PAVEMENT BELOW THREW ALL THE SHADOWS WRONG AND COMBINED WITH THE GREEN-TINGED UPPER LIGHT TO MAKE EVEN MARGARET'S OWN FACE AS SHE CAUGHT IT IN THE MIRRORS LOOK GHASTLY AND WAN
THAT IS MR HALE HER FATHER TALKING NOW TO MR STEPHENS
HE HAS LIVED AN EASY LIFE IN HIS COLLEGE ALL HIS DAYS
AS IF HE DID NOT FEEL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER PRESENCE ALL OVER THOUGH HIS EYES HAD NEVER RESTED ON HER
AND IT WAS WITH A LITTLE SOFTENING OF HER DIGNIFIED LOOK AND MANNER THAT SHE WENT IN WEEKLY TO ARRANGE THE CHAMBER AS CAREFULLY AS IF HE MIGHT BE COMING HOME THAT VERY EVENING
HE REDDENED
COTTON AND SPECULATIONS AND SMOKE WELL-CLEANSED AND WELL-CARED-FOR MACHINERY AND UNWASHED AND NEGLECTED HANDS
THEER THEER MASTER
MEN OF THE SAME LEVEL AS REGARDED EDUCATION AND STATION TOOK SUDDENLY THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF MASTERS AND MEN OWING TO THE MOTHERWIT AS REGARDED OPPORTUNITIES AND PROBABILITIES WHICH DISTINGUISHED SOME AND MADE THEM FAR-SEEING AS TO WHAT GREAT FUTURE LAY CONCEALED IN THAT RUDE MODEL OF SIR RICHARD ARKWRIGHT'S
HE WAS THE PLAIN ONE IN A SINGULARLY GOOD-LOOKING FAMILY
I WAS ALWAYS IN A PANIC ABOUT THIS LEONARDS WHO WAS I KNEW SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
SHE WAS CLEAR AND DISTINCT ENOUGH
BUT IF YO ASK ME TO COOL YO'R TONGUE WI TH TIP OF MY FINGER I'LL COME ACROSS THE GREAT GULF TO YO JUST FOR TH THOUGHT O WHAT YO'VE BEEN TO ME HERE BESSY
THAT'S RIGHT
BUT DEATH COMES TO US ALL
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS
THE SCENE ON THE LITTLE TERRACE IN THE HELSTONE GARDEN WAS SO PRESENT TO HER THAT SHE COULD HARDLY HELP BELIEVING IT WAS SO WITH HIM
HE WOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE HASTE OF HIS HOT PASSION
IT IS VERY GOOD AND KIND OF THEM
I THINK I UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS JOHN SAID FANNY LAUGHING IN HER LITTLE WEAK NERVOUS WAY
BETTER I HOPE NOW THE WIND HAS CHANGED BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
IT IS AN OLD DREAM BUT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK ON WINDY NIGHTS TILL I AM THANKFUL TO WAKEN SITTING STRAIGHT AND STIFF UP IN BED WITH MY TERROR
EVERY TALENT EVERY FEELING EVERY ACQUIREMENT
WHAT DO I CARE FOR THEE MARGARET TOOK HER HAND AND HELD IT SOFTLY IN HERS
DON'T SPEAK IN THESE HALF SENTENCES OR I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU WELL MISS SINCE YOU WILL HAVE IT--SARAH YOU SEE WAS IN THE BEST PLACE FOR SEEING BEING AT THE RIGHT-HAND WINDOW
THERE IS SOME UNCOMFORTABLE WORK GOING ON IN THE TOWN
ARE YO SURE HE'S DEAD SAID SHE TRYING TO GET UP
SHE PASSED SO BAD A NIGHT THAT SHE WAS ILL PREPARED FOR THE ADDITIONAL ANXIETY CAUSED BY A LETTER RECEIVED FROM FREDERICK
I DID HEAR A YOUNG LASS MAKE AN ADO ABOUT KNOWING WHERE WE LIVED AND COMING TO SEE US
AND THEN HE THOUGHT OVER EVERY TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN HER ONCE AGAIN BY WAY OF FINALLY FORGETTING HER
AND BEFORE THE WOMAN COULD FOLLOW HER WITH FURTHER QUESTIONS SHE HAD SPED UP-STAIRS AND ENTERED HER BED-CHAMBER AND BOLTED HER DOOR
HE REGRETTED HE HAD SEEN SO LITTLE OF YOU LATELY
I SEE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A CLASS MISS HALE
MR HALE TREATED ALL HIS FELLOW-CREATURES ALIKE
BESIDES SHE TELLS ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR FRIEND MISS HALE MISS HALE IS NO FRIEND OF MINE
IF CAPTAIN LENNOX COMES THIS AFTERNOON AND IF WE MUST--IF I MUST REALLY GO TO-MORROW OH YES
MR HALE STARTED FROM HIS LANGUID POSTURE IN HIS GREAT ARMCHAIR FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIS CHILDREN IN A DREAMY WAY AS IF THEY WERE ACTING SOME DRAMA OF HAPPINESS WHICH IT WAS PRETTY TO LOOK AT BUT WHICH WAS DISTINCT FROM REALITY AND IN WHICH HE HAD NO PART
ONE WORD MORE
PERHAPS NOT
SHE WAS DISPLEASED AT THE PERSONAL CHARACTER MR THORNTON AFFIXED TO WHAT SHE HAD SAID
FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN-DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES
THE LAST DAY CAME
BUT I AM TIRED
THEY MAY PLEDGE AND MAKE PLEDGE CONTINUED HE SCORNFULLY
AND UNTIL SHE COULD RECOLLECT EVEN TO THE PLACING OR OMITTING AN ARTICLE THE VERY EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE HAD USED IN THE NOTE HER MIND REFUSED TO GO ON WITH ITS PROGRESS
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MERE CHANCE BUT SO IT WAS THAT MARGARET NEVER HEARD THAT HE HAD ATTENDED HER POOR MOTHER'S FUNERAL
WHEN I WENT IN HE WOULD BE QUITE QUIET BUT ALL IN A MAZE LIKE
THEY HAD SEEN THE LAST OF THE LONG LOW PARSONAGE HOME HALF-COVERED WITH CHINA-ROSES AND PYRACANTHUS--MORE HOMELIKE THAN EVER IN THE MORNING SUN THAT GLITTERED ON ITS WINDOWS EACH BELONGING TO SOME WELL-LOVED ROOM
AND SHE WENT PRETTY OFTEN TO SEE MARY HIGGINS WHO HAD CHARGE OF THEM
SHE FELT INCLINED TO WISH THEM SUCCESS
I COULD NOT COME SOONER
MARGARET THOUGHT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM TO SO MUCH ADVANTAGE
MRS HALE WAS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM ON HER DAUGHTER'S RETURN
HE SAYS IT'S ALL NOUGHT TO DO WITH THE THINGS O TO-DAY AND THAT'S HIS BUSINESS WHERE IS YOUR SISTER GONE FUSTIAN-CUTTING
AND MARGARET WAS SITTING ONE EVENING ALL ALONE IN THE LENNOXES'S DRAWING-ROOM NOT READING DIXON'S LETTERS WHICH YET SHE HELD IN HER HAND BUT THINKING OVER THEM AND RECALLING THE DAYS WHICH HAD BEEN AND PICTURING THE BUSY LIFE OUT OF WHICH HER OWN HAD BEEN TAKEN AND NEVER MISSED
HE DID NOT KNOW GOOD FROM EVIL
SHE HAD TO TRY AND THINK OF LITTLE NOTHINGS TO SAY ALL BREAKFAST-TIME IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF HER COMPANIONS THOUGHTS TOO STRONGLY TO THE LAST MEAL THEY HAD TAKEN TOGETHER WHEN THERE HAD BEEN A CONTINUAL STRAINED LISTENING FOR SOME SOUND OR SIGNAL FROM THE SICK-ROOM
EVERY COVER WAS TAKEN OFF AND THE APARTMENT BLAZED FORTH IN YELLOW SILK DAMASK AND A BRILLIANTLY-FLOWERED CARPET
YET A NOBLE COMPOSURE SATE UPON IT WHICH IMPRESSED THOSE WHO HAD JUST BEEN HEARING OF HIS CHANGED POSITION WITH A SENSE OF INHERENT DIGNITY AND MANLY STRENGTH
THEN SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD THAT AFTER ALL HIS LIGHTNESS MIGHT BE BUT ASSUMED TO COVER A BITTERNESS OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN STAMPED ON HER OWN HEART IF SHE HAD LOVED AND BEEN REJECTED
THE MOTHER QUIVERED AS SHE LAY IN MARGARET'S ARMS
HE CONTRADICTED HER AND SHE TOOK THE SAME SORT OF SMILING NOTICE OF HIS OPINION AS IF HE HAD AGREED WITH HER
I CANNOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT OF BEING IN THE POWER OF SUCH A BLACKGUARD AS LEONARDS
MARGARET TRIED TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCES WITH ONE OR TWO OF THEM WHILE HER FATHER STROVE TO RAISE THE WIDOW'S THOUGHTS INTO SOME HIGHER CHANNEL THAN THAT OF MERE HELPLESS QUERULOUSNESS
THEY KNOW MY DETERMINATION BY THIS TIME AS WELL AND AS FULLY AS YOU DO MR HORSFALL TOOK HIM A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE AS MARGARET CONJECTURED TO ASK HIM SOME OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE STRIKE
I TRIED NOT TO HATE HER WHEN SHE STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME BECAUSE,--I SAID TO MYSELF,--SHE WILL MAKE HIM HAPPY
SHE KEPT ITS WEIGHT TOGETHER BY TWO LARGE CORAL PINS LIKE SMALL ARROWS FOR LENGTH
IT IS TOO BAD TO FIND OUT THAT FOOLS--IGNORANT WAYWARD MEN LIKE THESE--JUST BY UNITING THEIR WEAK SILLY HEADS ARE TO RULE OVER THE FORTUNES OF THOSE WHO BRING ALL THE WISDOM THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AND OFTEN PAINFUL THOUGHT AND ANXIETY CAN GIVE
HE IS AN UNPREPOSSESSING-LOOKING FELLOW
HER LIFE SEEMED STILL BLEAK AND DREARY
INSTEAD OF CADIZ SHE HAD TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH CROMER
I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MR THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP-BOY
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU
HE WAS ABSORBED IN ONE IDEA--THAT THE LAST VISIBLE TOKEN OF THE PRESENCE OF HIS WIFE WAS TO BE CARRIED AWAY FROM HIM AND HIDDEN FROM HIS SIGHT
IT WILL DO ME MORE GOOD THAN ANYTHING
YES INDEED SHE MUST SAID MARGARET
I AM HAUNTED BY THE FEAR THAT OUR COMING TO MILTON HAS KILLED HER
IT MADE ME THE MORE ANXIOUS THAT THERE SHOULD BE FAIR PLAY ON EACH SIDE
SO I WENT UP TO THE ROOF WHERE THERE WERE STONES PILED READY TO DROP ON THE HEADS OF THE CROWD IF THEY TRIED TO FORCE THE FACTORY DOORS
I RELY UPON YOU OH
SUDDENLY HE STARTED UP
I TEACH IN ORDER TO GET PAID AND THEM THAT PAYS YO DUN THEY TELL YO WHATTEN TO DO OR WHATTEN NOT TO DO WI THE MONEY THEY GIVES YOU IN JUST PAYMENT FOR YOUR PAINS--IN FAIR EXCHANGE LIKE NO
HERE YOU READ OR HAVE LESSONS OR OTHERWISE IMPROVE YOUR MIND TILL THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
BUT NOTHING SHORT OF HER FAITHFUL LOVE FOR MRS HALE COULD HAVE MADE HER ENDURE THE ROUGH INDEPENDENT WAY IN WHICH ALL THE MILTON GIRLS WHO MADE APPLICATION FOR THE SERVANT'S PLACE REPLIED TO HER INQUIRIES RESPECTING THEIR QUALIFICATIONS
SAID I WERE TO TELL YO TO MIND YO'R OWN BUSINESS.--THAT'S THE LONGEST SPIN YET MY LADS.--AND THEM'S CIVIL WORDS TO WHAT HE USED TO ME
I MEAN OVER PURCHASERS--OVER THE WHOLE WORLD'S MARKET
AND SHE CAREFULLY READ THEM OVER AGAIN WITH THE SOLE INTENTION WHEN SHE BEGAN TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY ON HOW FINE A CHANCE THE JUSTIFICATION OF HER BROTHER HUNG
HE'D GIVE HIM UP TO TH MILL-OWNERS TO DO WHAT THEY WOULD WI HIM
IT WAS NO EXPLANATION
THEN EDITH CAME BACK GLOWING WITH PLEASURE HALF-SHYLY HALF-PROUDLY LEADING IN HER TALL HANDSOME CAPTAIN
THEY ALONE SEEMED STRANGE AND FRIENDLESS AND DESOLATE
WHAT DO YOU SAY MARGARET
IN THE NEXT LETTER FREDERICK SPOKE SO JOYFULLY OF THE FUTURE THAT HE HAD NO THOUGHT FOR THE PAST
SHE SAW HER FATHER'S ANXIETY LAY DEEPER THAN THE SOURCE OF HIS LATTER CHEERING WORDS
HOW RECONCILE THOSE EYES THAT VOICE WITH THE HARD-REASONING DRY MERCILESS WAY IN WHICH HE LAID DOWN AXIOMS OF TRADE AND SERENELY FOLLOWED THEM OUT TO THEIR FULL CONSEQUENCES
I WERE AT THE COMMITTEE TILL I WERE SICKENED OUT WI TRYING TO MAKE FOOLS HEAR REASON
THEY SAY IT WINDS ROUND THE LUNGS AND TIGHTENS THEM UP
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WILL GO A-WALKING AGAIN WITH YOUR BEAU AT SUCH AN HOUR OF THE DAY IN A HURRY
MRS HALE LAY BACK IN AN EASY CHAIR WITH A SOFT WHITE SHAWL WRAPPED AROUND HER AND A BECOMING CAP PUT ON IN EXPECTATION OF THE DOCTOR'S VISIT
THEY WERE GROWING OUT OF CHILDREN INTO GREAT GIRLS
DREW NEAR THE BED AND SAW THE CALM BEAUTIFUL FACE LYING WHITE AND COLD UNDER THE INEFFACEABLE SEAL OF DEATH
MISS HALE DOES US CREDIT DOES SHE NOT I WISH I WAS AS TALL AS A QUEEN AND AS BROWN AS A GIPSY MARGARET BUT ABOUT MR THORNTON OH I REALLY HAVE SUCH A TERRIBLE HEAD FOR LAW BUSINESS
WHAT COULD THEY GIVE
HE SHOWED FAR MORE DEPRESSION THAN SHE DID
BUT SUDDENLY SHE WALKED FORWARDS AND OPENED THE STUDY DOOR AND PRECEDED HIM TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE WHICH SHE THREW WIDE OPEN FOR HIS EXIT
HOW THANKFUL SHE WAS THEN THAT SHE HAD KEPT TO HERSELF THE ADDITIONAL CAUSE FOR ANXIETY PRODUCED BY THEIR ENCOUNTER WITH LEONARDS
AND I TRUST IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS
FIVE SHILLING A WEEK MAY DO WELL ENOUGH FOR THEE WI BUT TWO MOUTHS TO FILL AND ONE ON EM A WENCH WHO CAN WELLY EARN HER OWN MEAT
HAMPER WILL SPEAK TO MY BEING A GOOD HAND I'VE A NOTION YOU'D BETTER NOT SEND ME TO HAMPER TO ASK FOR A CHARACTER MY MAN
I DO NOT KNOW MR HALE
I'LL NOT MISTRUST YO NO MORE
SHE SAW IT IN HIS PITYING EYES
MOTHER HOW YOU HAVE TORTURED ME
HERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS TO HAVE DINED WITH THEM TO-DAY LYING DEAD OR DYING INSTEAD
MANY'S THE TIME I'VE REPEATED THE VERSES IN THE SEVENTH CHAPTER TO MYSELF JUST FOR THE SOUND
BUT FOR THE WIFE'S SAKE AND THE BITS O CHILDER GOD BLESS YOU SAID MR HALE STARTING UP
OR SO HE SAID
AND HOW WELL I ROUNDED MY SENTENCE
BUT OH SIR
IT WAS A RELIEF TO HER TO AID DIXON IN ALL HER PREPARATIONS FOR MASTER FREDERICK IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE NEVER COULD BE TIRED AGAIN
A JEST OF ANY KIND
AND THEN AT THE STATION A MAN CAME UP--TIPSY AND REELING--AND HE TRIED TO COLLAR FRED AND OVER-BALANCED HIMSELF AS FRED WRENCHED HIMSELF AWAY AND FELL OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM
THE LINGERING GRAVITY AND SADNESS AND THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF MIND WERE NOT UNNATURAL SYMPTOMS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF GRIEF
THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING
COULD NOT YOU GET IT BACK AGAIN WHEN YOU TOLD HER IT WAS YOURS NO
IT WERE A DAY OR TWO AGO SHE AXED TO BE BURIED IN SOMEWHAT O YOURN
BUT OF COURSE SHE OWED IT TO HERSELF TO BE A GENTLEWOMAN AND TO SPEAK COURTEOUSLY FROM TIME TO TIME TO THIS STRANGER
THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A SALE SO SELECT WHAT THINGS YOU WISH RESERVED
INDEED MISS SAID DIXON
SHALL I READ IT YOU MAMMA SHE READ IT ALOUD AND FOR A TIME IT SEEMED TO INTEREST HER MOTHER WHO KEPT WONDERING WHAT NAME EDITH HAD GIVEN TO HER BOY AND SUGGESTING ALL PROBABLE NAMES AND ALL POSSIBLE REASONS WHY EACH AND ALL OF THESE NAMES SHOULD BE GIVEN
I SUPPOSE I AM NOT MUCH TO SEE EH MARGARET HE JOKED TO GIVE HER TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE SLIGHT FLUTTER WHICH HE HAD DETECTED IN HER MANNER ON HIS PROPOSAL TO LEAVE
HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SAID ALL THOSE CRUEL THINGS ABOUT ME TO HIM
SHE PETTED MARGARET IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY AND BOUGHT EVERY DELICACY OR SOFT LUXURY IN WHICH SHE HERSELF WOULD HAVE BURROWED AND SOUGHT COMFORT
IT TOO WAS A SHADOW
I FANCY IT WAS LOVE THAT FIRST PREDISPOSED HIM TO CONVERSION SAID MARGARET SIGHING
I'LL FAINT ON YOUR HANDS AT THE SERVANTS DINNER-TIME THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY
AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY PRETTY MAID ASKED HE
IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING
I WILL PUT MY ARM IN THE BOLT SOONER THAN HE SHOULD COME TO THE SLIGHTEST HARM
SHE KNEW THAT SHE DID FROM THE CANDLE-LIGHTER THRUST THROUGH THE KEYHOLE OF HER BEDROOM DOOR
WHAT WI HARD WORK FIRST AND SICKNESS AT LAST HOO'S LED THE LIFE OF A DOG
MARGARET LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT THE NOTION PRESENTED TO HER
HAVE YOU GOT YOUR BAG
FOR MARGARET'S MR BELL THERE IS NO KNOWING WHAT SACRIFICES YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SAID HER BROTHER-IN-LAW
PRETTY MUCH LIKE HERSELF AS SHE WAS BEFORE THIS ATTACK
AND YET THAT MONOTONOUS LIFE SEEMED ALMOST TOO MUCH
YET SHE WAS JUST THINKING THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO AND SEE AFTER THE WELL-DOING OF THE KITCHEN FIRE WHICH THERE WAS NOBODY BUT HERSELF TO ATTEND TO WHEN SHE HEARD THE MUFFLED DOOR-RING WITH SO VIOLENT A PULL THAT THE WIRES JINGLED ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE THOUGH THE POSITIVE SOUND WAS NOT GREAT
I CAN DEPEND UPON MYSELF FOR HAVING NO GO-AHEAD THEORIES THAT I WOULD RASHLY BRING INTO PRACTICE
BUT IF THEY WOULD BE FOOLS AND PUT THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF A RASCALLY SET OF PAID DELEGATES THEY MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCE
THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF PACKING-CASES WHICH WERE BEING CARTED OFF AT THE FRONT DOOR TO THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATION
BUT THE INSTANT SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S DOOR LOCKED SHE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND THROWING HER DRESSING-GOWN ON SHE BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE ROOM UNTIL THE CREAKING OF ONE OF THE BOARDS REMINDED HER THAT SHE MUST MAKE NO NOISE
HOW'S THE VICAR AND MISS DIXON
BUT SHE COULD NOT
SHE REPLIED OUT IN HER USUAL TONE
DIXON CAN GET US A COACH I SUPPOSE SO MRS SHAW WENT TO TAKE CARE OF MARGARET AND TOOK HER MAID WITH HER TO TAKE CARE OF THE SHAWLS AND AIR-CUSHIONS
TH FACTORY DOORS WILL NEED OPEN WIDE TO-MORROW TO LET IN ALL WHO'LL BE AXING FOR WORK
BEFORE THEY WENT TO CROMER SHE HAD BEEN AS DOCILE TO HER AUNT'S LAWS AS IF SHE WERE STILL THE SCARED LITTLE STRANGER WHO CRIED HERSELF TO SLEEP THAT FIRST NIGHT IN THE HARLEY STREET NURSERY
IT WAS ONLY ON TUESDAY WHEN I WAS OUT THAT I MET A SOUTHAMPTON MAN--THE FIRST I'VE SEEN SINCE I CAME TO MILTON
MARGARET DID NOT REPLY
A LETTER I HAVE HAD THIS MORNING FROM EDITH
BUT I AM VERY SORRY THEY WERE VERY QUIET AND STILL FOR SOME MINUTES
AND AS FOR THE GIRL--SHE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO PUZZLES ME WHEN I THINK ABOUT HER,--WHICH I DON'T OFTEN DO
TO WHICH HE MADE ANSWER LIKE THE IMPUDENT CHAP HE IS THAT HE WERE IN A CONFIDENTIAL SITUATION AND IF I KNEW OF ANY YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO LEAD VICIOUS COURSES AND WANTED TO TURN STEADY HE'D HAVE NO OBJECTION TO LEND HIM HIS PATRONAGE
ALLOW ME TO SAY IT IS BECAUSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME I DO NOT CARE TO UNDERSTAND SHE REPLIED TAKING HOLD OF THE TABLE TO STEADY HERSELF
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK ALL AT ONCE
BUT DON'T PROPOSE ANYTHING WHICH WILL DETAIN FREDERICK IN ENGLAND
IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
THE NECESSITY FOR KEEPING UP A CONSTANT FLOW OF CHEERFUL CONVERSATION FOR HER MOTHER WHO NOW THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO GO OUT ALWAYS LOOKED TO MARGARET'S RETURN FROM THE SHORTEST WALK AS BRINGING IN SOME NEWS
HOW COULD ONE SO PURE HAVE STOOPED FROM HER DECOROUS AND NOBLE MANNER OF BEARING
WHATTEN YO ASKING FOR MARGARET WAS SURPRISED AT THIS LAST QUESTION FOR AT HELSTONE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNDERSTOOD THING AFTER THE INQUIRIES SHE HAD MADE THAT SHE INTENDED TO COME AND CALL UPON ANY POOR NEIGHBOUR WHOSE NAME AND HABITATION SHE HAD ASKED FOR
SHE GAVE HIM A LOW GRAVE BOW WHEN HE LEFT AND HE FELT MORE AWKWARD AND SELF-CONSCIOUS IN EVERY LIMB THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN ALL HIS LIFE BEFORE
I TRY TO BEAR IT
MR THORNTON MISS MARGARET
AND AS HE HAS TOLD YOU A PART I WILL FILL UP WHAT HE LEFT OUT
HENRY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR AND BROUGHT OUT HIS DRY CAUSTIC WIT ADMIRABLY
I RATHER THINK I AM ALREADY BEGINNING TO DO SO
CONSEQUENTLY SHE RECEIVED MANY SHORT ANSWERS
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE THE STRONG WOMAN TOTTERED
AND SHE LOOKED ALL ROUND WITH A KIND OF CAT-LIKE REGRET AT THE IDEA OF LEAVING IT FOR EVER IN THREE DAYS
SHE HAD PLANNED OTHER EMPLOYMENTS FOR HERSELF
IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT SHE REMARKED AT LAST
BUT PERHAPS AS YOU'RE NOT WELL YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING ON ONE SIDE AND THERE IS ANOTHER AND A BRIGHTER TO BE LOOKED TO IT'S ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR YO TO SAY SO WHO HAVE LIVED IN PLEASANT GREEN PLACES ALL YOUR LIFE LONG AND NEVER KNOWN WANT OR CARE OR WICKEDNESS EITHER FOR THAT MATTER TAKE CARE SAID MARGARET HER CHEEK FLUSHING AND HER EYE LIGHTENING HOW YOU JUDGE BESSY
SOMETHING UNUSUAL SEEMED GOING ON
AND A TENDER MOTHER TO ME GO TO HER AND GAIN HER CONFIDENCE AND TELL HER WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE
A LIGHTER CLEVERER MORE WORLDLY MAN AND AS SUCH DISSONANT TO MR HALE
BUT THE MOST CRUEL CUT OF ALL WAS THAT OF THE MILTON WORKMEN WHO HAD DEFIED AND DISOBEYED THE COMMANDS OF THE UNION TO KEEP THE PEACE WHATEVER CAME
I AM BUT UNCOUTH AND HARD BUT I WOULD NEVER HAVE LED YOU INTO ANY FALSEHOOD FOR ME THE MORE MRS THORNTON THOUGHT OVER WHAT HER SON HAD SAID IN PLEADING FOR A MERCIFUL JUDGMENT FOR MARGARET'S INDISCRETION THE MORE BITTERLY SHE FELT INCLINED TOWARDS HER
WE STAND UP FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSE CENTRALISATION IN SHORT YOU WOULD LIKE THE HEPTARCHY BACK AGAIN
HIS FACE WAS VERY GRAY AND GRIM
HOWEVER MARGARET DEFIED THE RAVEN AND WOULD HOPE
IS NOT MARGARET THE HEIRESS WHISPERED EDITH TO HER HUSBAND AS THEY WERE IN THEIR ROOM ALONE AT NIGHT AFTER THE SAD JOURNEY TO OXFORD
AND TALKING WAS THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE BESIDES EATING AT BREAKFAST
HE CALLED JANE
IN A WORD WHEN THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THOU MUST CONTINUE IF THOU WILT CONTINUE IN THY EMPLOYMENTS ARE SINFUL AND UNWARRANTED BY THE WORD OF GOD THOU MAYEST YEA THOU MUST BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL TURN THY VERY SILENCE SUSPENSION DEPRIVATION AND LAYING ASIDE TO HIS GLORY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GOSPEL'S INTEREST
I AM TRYING TO DESCRIBE HELSTONE AS IT REALLY IS
HER PASSIONATE DECLARATION THAT THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT VIOLENT AND DESPERATE CROWD FOR WHOM SHE DID NOT CARE AS MUCH AS FOR HIM
BEAUTY AND HEIRESS AS SHE MAY BE SHE WILL FIND IT HARD TO MEET WITH A TRUER HEART THAN MINE
GOD DOES NOT WILLINGLY AFFLICT
IT IS IT IS--(BRUSHING AWAY THE TEARS WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND).--'BUT YO KNOW SHE'S LYING DEAD AT HOME AND I'M WELLY DAZED WI SORROW AND AT TIMES I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING SHE MIGHT GO AND SEE HER MOTHER JUST AT THAT VERY TIME
SHE WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE ROOM WHILE DIXON WAS ADMITTED
BUT AS SHE CAME NEAR HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT AND PLACING HIS HANDS ON HER HEAD HE SAID SOLEMNLY
I'M FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND THAT LITTLE FACT OF ITSELF ACCOUNTS FOR ANY LOSS OF STRENGTH NONSENSE
HE WOULD TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PREVENTING THE INQUEST THE ISSUE OF WHICH FROM THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE MEDICAL TESTIMONY WHICH HE HAD VAGUELY HEARD THE NIGHT BEFORE FROM THE SURGEON IN ATTENDANCE COULD BE BUT DOUBTFUL
WHO ENVIED THE POWER OF THE WILD BIRD THAT CAN FEED HER YOUNG WITH HER VERY HEART'S BLOOD
THERE'S TWO OPINIONS GO TO SETTLING THAT POINT
BUT NOW THE COURSE IS CLEAR AT LEAST TO A CERTAIN POINT
SO THAT LONG LINGERING LOOK AROUND THE ROOM IN WHICH HER FATHER HAD DIED HAD TO BE INTERRUPTED AND A QUIET FAREWELL TAKEN OF THE KIND OLD FACE THAT HAD SO OFTEN COME OUT WITH PLEASANT WORDS AND MERRY QUIPS AND CRANKS
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
YO'VE BEEN A POOR FOOL AS KNOWED NO BETTER NOR BE A TRUE FAITHFUL FOOL
THEY HAD PROMISED EDITH BEFORE STARTING THAT IF ALL HAD ENDED AS THEY FEARED THEY WOULD RETURN TO DINNER
IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
I MERELY JUDGE HIM FROM MR HORSFALL'S ACCOUNT I SUSPECT MY GENTLEMAN INCLUDES YOUR TRUE MAN AND A GREAT DEAL MORE YOU WOULD IMPLY
IT WAS NOT BOUCHER THAT THREW THE STONE'--SHE WENT FIRST RED THEN WHITE
AND HE CAME UP TO HER WITH THE PERFECTLY REGULATED MANNER OF AN OLD FRIEND
BUT I'M NOT THE FIRST MAN AS IS MISLED BY A WOMAN TELL HER TO MIND HER OWN BUSINESS THE NEXT TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING UP YOUR TIME AND MINE TOO
ONLY DUNNOT LOSE HEART MAN CONTINUED HE AS HE FUMBLED IN A TEA-POT FOR WHAT MONEY HE HAD
THERE WAS A PITIFUL CONTRACTION OF SUFFERING UPON HER BEAUTIFUL BROWS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF CONSCIOUSNESS REMAINING
THEY MUST DEGRADE YOU IN THE LONG RUN IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD EVEN IF IN FACT THEY DO NOT LEAD YOU TO POSITIVE HARM FOR MY MOTHER'S SAKE SAID MARGARET IN A TEARFUL VOICE I WILL BEAR MUCH
DIXON HAD GOT MARY HIGGINS TO SCOLD AND DIRECT IN THE KITCHEN
IT WAS MORE DARING THAN BECAME A MAN TO THREATEN HER SO
MR THORNTON PROMISED THAT SHE SHOULD--CONVERSED A LITTLE AND THEN TOOK HIS LEAVE
HALF FARM-HOUSE HALF-INN STANDING A LITTLE APART FROM THE ROAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE HOST DID NOT SO DEPEND ON THE CUSTOM OF TRAVELLERS AS TO HAVE TO COURT IT BY ANY OBTRUSIVENESS
IF YOU LOOK SO PALE AS THIS I MUST ROUGE YOU UP A LITTLE
BUT THAT THERE WERE NOTHING LIKE IT FOR GIVING A PERSON WHAT THEY WISHED FOR
SHE WAS NOT SURE IF SHE WOULD GO WHERE PERMISSION WAS GIVEN SO LIKE A FAVOUR CONFERRED
YOU HAVE BEEN IN LONDON OF COURSE YES SAID MARGARET I HAVE LIVED THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS OH
HIS SPIRITS WERE ALWAYS TENDER AND GENTLE READILY AFFECTED BY ANY SMALL PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING THE WELFARE OF OTHERS
YOU ARE SORELY TIRED
SO DUNNOT TURN FAINT-HEART AND GO TO TH TYRANTS A-SEEKING WORK THE MAN TURNED ROUND AT THESE WORDS,--TURNED ROUND A FACE SO WHITE AND GAUNT AND TEAR-FURROWED AND HOPELESS THAT ITS VERY CALM FORCED MARGARET TO WEEP
AND HOW ARE YOU ALL
AND FOR ALL HE SAID HE'D GOT A CONFIDENTIAL SITUATION HE WAS DRESSED IN FUSTIAN JUST LIKE A WORKING-MAN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT FREDERICK MUST GO
HE DARED NOT LEAVE HER
BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT
IT IS THAT THAT IS THE GREAT PERPLEXITY POOR MARIA REPLIED MR HALE TENDERLY
I MAY HAVE TO COME BACK TO ENGLAND AGAIN ON THIS BUSINESS SO KEEP MY VISIT SECRET
MARGARET AS IF SHE READ HIS THOUGHT ADDRESSED HERSELF TO MR BELL BOTH INCLUDING HIM IN THE CONVERSATION AND IMPLYING THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE ENDEAVOURS THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO CLEAR FREDERICK
HAVING DOUBTS AND FEARS OF THEIR OWN AS TO THE SOLVENCY OF A FAMILY WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE OF THIRTY POUNDS A-YEAR AND YET GAVE THEMSELVES AIRS AND KEPT TWO SERVANTS ONE OF THEM SO VERY HIGH AND MIGHTY
THEY WERE TO BE PRESERVED HOWEVER AS VALUABLE
FOR AFTER TO-NIGHT I STAND SECOND
AND I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHY
AND CAN HOLD HER OR YOUR OWN TILL I COME
AND ON MARGARET'S SINGLING OUT A LITTLE COMMON DRINKING-CUP WHICH SHE REMEMBERED AS THE ONE ALWAYS STANDING BY BESSY'S SIDE WITH DRINK FOR HER FEVERISH LIPS MARY SAID
YOU KNOW WE HAVE VERY LITTLE SOCIETY HERE MAMMA
IDLE GENTLEMEN AND LADIES ARE NOT LIKELY TO KNOW MUCH OF A MILTON MANUFACTURER UNLESS HE GETS INTO PARLIAMENT OR MARRIES A LORD'S DAUGHTER BOTH MR HALE AND MARGARET HAD AN UNEASY LUDICROUS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS GREAT NAME UNTIL MR BELL HAD WRITTEN THEM WORD THAT MR THORNTON WOULD BE A GOOD FRIEND TO HAVE IN MILTON
I THINK THEY HAVE TOO MUCH SENSE AN I THINK REPLIED HE DASHING THE ASHES OUT OF HIS PIPE WITH SO MUCH VEHEMENCE THAT IT BROKE IT'S NOT THAT THEY'VE TOO MUCH SENSE BUT THAT THEY'VE TOO LITTLE SPIRIT O FATHER SAID BESSY WHAT HAVE YE GAINED BY STRIKING
FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY AFTER SHE HAD PASSED A NUMBER OF MEN SEVERAL OF WHOM HAD PAID HER THE NOT UNUSUAL COMPLIMENT OF WISHING SHE WAS THEIR SWEETHEART ONE OF THE LINGERERS ADDED YOUR BONNY FACE MY LASS MAKES THE DAY LOOK BRIGHTER AND ANOTHER DAY AS SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY SMILING AT SOME PASSING THOUGHT SHE WAS ADDRESSED BY A POORLY-DRESSED MIDDLE-AGED WORKMAN WITH YOU MAY WELL SMILE MY LASS
BUT WAS IT NOT TOO PERSONAL A SUBJECT TO SPEAK ABOUT TO STRANGERS
I'M AFRAID YOU ARE NOT VERY STRONG NO SAID THE GIRL NOR NEVER WILL BE SPRING IS COMING SAID MARGARET AS IF TO SUGGEST PLEASANT HOPEFUL THOUGHTS
WE'LL GO TO-MORROW MORNING AND WE SHALL GET THERE ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK I FANCY
WELL TO BE SURE WE MUST ALL DIE
WELL HENRY SAID SHE WITH A LOOK OF INTERROGATION
AND THE SECURITY OF THIS GAVE A FINE GRAND QUIETNESS TO HIS VOICE AND WAYS WHICH MARGARET HAD MISSED BEFORE
I SHALL SUFFER AS WELL AS THEY
IF MISS HALE CHANGES HER MIND AND CONDESCENDS TO BE CURIOUS AS TO THE MANUFACTURES OF MILTON I CAN ONLY SAY I SHALL BE GLAD TO PROCURE HER ADMISSION TO PRINT-WORKS OR REED-MAKING OR THE MORE SIMPLE OPERATIONS OF SPINNING CARRIED ON IN MY SON'S MILL
REALLY ILL--NOT MERELY AILING
AND WHEN THEY CAME AWAY SHE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CHEER HER FATHER
AND I WOULD HAVE LIFTED THOSE HEAVY STONES AND DROPPED THEM WITH AS GOOD AN AIM AS THE BEST MAN THERE BUT THAT I FAINTED WITH THE HEAT I HAD GONE THROUGH
THE AFFRIGHTED GIRL STOLE OUT AGAIN ON TIP-TOE AND WENT AND TOLD MRS DIXON THAT MISS HALE WAS CRYING AS IF HER HEART WOULD BREAK
HE SHRANK FROM HEARING MARGARET'S VERY NAME MENTIONED
DON'T LET US GO ON MAKING EACH OTHER ANGRY
AND THAT'S A DEAL FRO ME SAID HE MORE FRANKLY SUDDENLY TURNING ROUND AND FACING MR THORNTON FULLY FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND HE WAS OVER AT MRS HALE'S DEATH NAY
I AM WEARY OF THIS CONTINUAL CALL UPON ME FOR STRENGTH
WELL THIRD TIME PAYS FOR ALL
HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION
HIS THOUGHTS WERE FIXED ON ONE SUBJECT AND IT WAS AN EFFORT TO HIM TO FOLLOW THE ZIG-ZAG REMARKS OF HIS CHILDREN--AN EFFORT WHICH HE DID NOT MAKE
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE IN ALL A MAN CARES FOR HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO FIND ONESELF NO LONGER YOUNG--YET THROWN BACK TO THE STARTING-POINT WHICH REQUIRES THE HOPEFUL ENERGY OF YOUTH--TO FEEL ONE HALF OF LIFE GONE AND NOTHING DONE--NOTHING REMAINING OF WASTED OPPORTUNITY BUT THE BITTER RECOLLECTION THAT IT HAS BEEN
HIGGINS AND ANOTHER MAN STOPPED OVER-HOURS THAT NIGHT UNKNOWN TO ANY ONE TO GET THE NEGLECTED PIECE OF WORK DONE
FORGIVE ME I HAVE BEEN TOO ABRUPT
SHE DID NOT MOVE
I MAY BE PUTTING TEMPTATION IN YOUR WAY
TELL AUNT HALE NOT TO BRING MANY WARM CLOTHES THOUGH I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE LATE IN THE YEAR BEFORE YOU CAN COME
AN SHE WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE
JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED--SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
SHALL I GO AND PUT THEM ON ONE AFTER ANOTHER MAMMA AND THEN YOU COULD SEE WHICH YOU LIKED BEST BUT--YES
MR LENNOX WATCHED HER COUNTENANCE
DON'T LET DIXON'S FANCIES COME ANY MORE BETWEEN YOU AND ME MAMMA
SHE FANCIED THAT HE AS WELL AS SHE PERCEIVED THAT THEY HAD DRIFTED STRANGELY APART FROM THEIR FORMER ANCHORAGE SIDE BY SIDE IN MANY OF THEIR OPINIONS AND ALL THEIR TASTES
BUT STILL IT IS HARD TO THINK THAT ANY ONE--ANY WOMAN--CAN BELIEVE ALL THIS OF ANOTHER SO EASILY
BUT AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THE ROOM HE SUDDENLY ASKED HALE
WHEN DID YOU WRITE TO FREDERICK MARGARET
SO I DON'T THINK I'M A COMPETENT WITNESS
I BELIEVE I WAS TALKING WITH REFERENCE TO A GOOD DEAL THAT HAS BEEN TROUBLING US OF LATE
SHE WAS UNSPEAKABLY TOUCHED BY THE TENDER EFFORTS OF HER FATHER TO THINK OF CHEERFUL SUBJECTS ON WHICH TO TALK AND SO TO TAKE HER THOUGHTS AWAY FROM DWELLING ON ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED OF LATE
FOR UNLESS SHE WERE UP IN THE SKY THE CHILD THOUGHT THEY MUST BE DEEP DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH
I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT
AND HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN IRRITABILITY OF TEMPER AT THE TIME WHICH PROBABLY MADE THEM BOTH QUITS
BEFORE IT'S ENDED I SHALL BE IN THE GREAT CITY--THE HOLY JERUSALEM HOO'S SO FULL OF TH LIFE TO COME HOO CANNOT THINK OF TH PRESENT
AND UPON THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE MET AND CONQUERED--NOT MERELY PUSHED ASIDE FOR THE TIME--DEPENDS OUR FUTURE
WHO WILL TAKE UP YOUR CAUSE THE WIDOW OPENED HER EYES WIDE AND LOOKED AT THE NEW SPEAKER OF WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE TILL THEN
GO JANE CONTINUED HE ADDRESSING THE UPPER-SERVANT
MARGARET WENT UP TO DRESS FOR THE EARLY TEA FINDING DIXON IN A PRETTY TEMPER FROM THE INTERRUPTION WHICH A VISITOR HAD NATURALLY OCCASIONED ON A BUSY DAY
SHE FELT NO FEAR IN SPEAKING TO HIM THOUGH HE HURT HER ARM WITH HIS GRIPE AND WILD GLEAMS CAME ACROSS THE STUPIDITY OF HIS EYES
A PICKAXE OR A BILL
FOR A MINUTE THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN ITS RIGIDNESS
MR COLTHURST CAN PUMP HIM WELL ON ALL THE SUBJECTS IN WHICH HE IS INTERESTED AND IT WILL BE GREAT FUN TO TRACE OUT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND THIS MR THORNTON'S WISDOM IN MR COLTHURST'S NEXT SPEECH IN THE HOUSE
I BEG YOUR PARDON MADAM
THEY LASHED THEMSELVES UP INTO AN ENTHUSIASM ABOUT HIGH SUBJECTS IN COMPANY AND NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY WERE ALONE
DID THEY REALLY SAIL ON TUESDAY REALLY SAILED AND RELIEVED ME FROM MANY RESPONSIBILITIES
SHE SAYS SHE MUST LEAVE US
NOT FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
COME TO MY WAREHOUSE AT FOUR VERY WELL SIR AND THEY PARTED COMPANY
I HAD SUCH A MOTHER AS FEW ARE BLEST WITH
THEIR DAYS LATE AS IT WAS IN THE YEAR SEEMED SPENT IN BOATING OR LAND PIC-NICS
I DARE SAY THERE'S MANY A WOMAN MAKES AS SAD A MISTAKE AS I HAVE DONE AND ONLY FINDS IT OUT TOO LATE
TO HER SURPRISE HER FATHER BEGAN TO WALK ABOUT AGAIN BEFORE HE ANSWERED
THERE WAS A MOVEMENT THROUGH ALL THE CROWD--A RETREATING MOVEMENT
IN THIS SHE WAS BUT HER MOTHER'S CHILD
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TROUBLESOME JOB AND NO SATISFACTION
THERE SHOULD BE NO INQUEST
THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND NEVER WOULD
ALL THAT DEVELOPES ONE PART OF THE INTELLECT
WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
I SEEK HEAVENLY STEADFASTNESS IN EARTHLY MONOTONY
SHE HAS BEEN VERY FAROUCHE WITH ME FOR A LONG TIME
THERE'S WHO'S TO MANAGE THE FUNERAL
NAY HIGGINS I DON'T CARE ONE STRAW FOR YOUR ANGER
AS FOR MR HALE ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER HAD AN IDEA OF THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THEIR APPREHENSIONS HE TRIUMPHED OVER THEIR FEARS WITH AN EVIDENT RELIEF WHICH PROVED HOW MUCH HIS GLIMPSE INTO THE NATURE OF THEM HAD AFFECTED HIM
WHAT FALL CAUSED BY THE BLOW OR PUSH OF WHICH BETSY SPEAKS THEN THERE WAS A BLOW OR PUSH I BELIEVE SO AND WHO DID IT AS THERE WAS NO INQUEST IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DOCTOR'S OPINION I CANNOT TELL YOU BUT MISS HALE WAS THERE NO ANSWER
YOU WOULD HAVE INJURED NO ONE NO
OH MARGARET MARGARET
WHY SHE'LL HAVE MY MONEY AT MY DEATH
OH YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE LIFE TO COME--THE LIFE HIDDEN WITH GOD THAT SHE IS NOW GONE TO HE SHOOK HIS HEAD GLANCING SIDEWAYS UP AT MARGARET AS HE DID SO
HERE WHISTH THEE CHILD--WHISTH THEE
AND YET WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN UNUSUALLY WELL OR WITH REMARKABLE EPIGRAMMATIC POINT SHE FELT THAT HIS EYE SOUGHT THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE FIRST OF ALL IF BUT FOR AN INSTANT
BUT ALL WAS PROFOUNDLY HUSHED IN THE NOONDAY STILLNESS OF A HOUSE WHERE AN INVALID CATCHES THE UNREFRESHING SLEEP THAT IS DENIED TO THE NIGHT-HOURS
WE CAN'T HELP THAT SHE CONTINUED SOFTLY
HE IS SO DEAF YOU WILL HEAR ALL OUR SECRETS THE OLD MAN STOOD BAREHEADED IN THE SUN LEANING ON HIS STICK AT THE FRONT OF HIS COTTAGE
I WENT THERE ON MY RETURN FROM HAVRE YOU MUST GIVE THEM TO ME SHE SAID TRYING TO TAKE THEM OUT OF HIS HAND WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE
THEY AWAITED HER PERFECT RECOVERY IN SILENCE
ONLY I SHOULD LIKE IT TO BE A VERY FINE SUMMER MORNING
I HAVE NOT SEEN THE CORONER
BUT HE WHEN HE SAW HER SPRANG UP IN A MINUTE AND RELIEVED HER OF HER BURDEN
FOR SHE THOUGHT HIM CRUEL--AS INDEED HE WAS--AND SHE WAS WEAK WITH HER INDIGNATION
I HADN'T HEARD OF IT BEFORE AND I THOUGHT--I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT PAPA HAD TOLD YOU ABOUT IT NO
YOU THINK I'M AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE IDEAS ARE BOUNDED BY MILTON AND WHOSE OWN CROW IS THE WHITEST EVER SEEN NO SAID MARGARET WITH SOME SPIRIT
IT WILL BE SAFER THAN LOSING OURSELVES AND BEING TOO LATE FOR THE TRAIN THIS AFTERNOON THERE WERE NO LETTERS AWAITING HIM
AND THEN SHE RETURNED TO THE PRESENT LIFE
AND THE LETTER WENT YES
AND OPENING HER EYES AND LOOKING EARNESTLY AT MARGARET I BELIEVE PERHAPS MORE THAN YO DO O WHAT'S TO COME
IT'S NOUT SAID BESSY
A WORKING MAN CAN HARDLY BE MADE TO FEEL AND KNOW HOW MUCH HIS EMPLOYER MAY HAVE LABOURED IN HIS STUDY AT PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS WORKPEOPLE
THEY'RE REAL FOLK
MARGARET WAS WATCHING MR THORNTON'S FACE
SHE AND HE STOOD BY THE CORPSE
MR BELL HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO A MR THORNTON A TENANT OF HIS AND A VERY INTELLIGENT MAN AS FAR AS I CAN JUDGE FROM HIS LETTERS
HADN'T BEEN IN OXFORD THIS SEVENTEEN YEARS--AND THIS IS THE END OF IT NOT ONE WORD WAS SPOKEN FOR ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
MY THEORY IS THAT MY INTERESTS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OF MY WORKPEOPLE AND VICE-VERSA
AFTER A WHILE THEY CEASED AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER SHE DURST GIVE HERSELF THE RELIEF OF TELLING HER FATHER OF ALL HER TROUBLE
NO MORE CONTEMPT FOR HER!--NO MORE TALK ABOUT THE CHIVALRIC
THIS MADE THE BEGINNING
THAT THERE STRIKE WAS BADLY MANAGED
MARGARET'S WHOLE SOUL ROSE UP AGAINST HIM WHILE HE REASONED IN THIS WAY--AS IF COMMERCE WERE EVERYTHING AND HUMANITY NOTHING
SHE DID NOT CRY--SHE ONLY QUIVERED UP HER BREATH MY HEART'S DRAINED DRY O TEARS SHE SAID
OH MA'AM SHE LOVED YO SHE LOVED YO SHE DID INDEED AND FOR A LONG TIME MARGARET COULD NOT GET HER TO SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS
YOU HAVE LED US OFF ONCE ALREADY SAID HER FATHER SMILING YET UNEASY AT THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE DETAINING MR THORNTON AGAINST HIS WILL WHICH WAS A MISTAKE
I HEARD HIS BREATH COMING QUICK AND AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT HE WERE SOBBING
YOU CAN HARDLY DO OTHERWISE DO OTHERWISE
EVERY THIRD NOTE ON AN AVERAGE BEING EITHER INDISTINCT OR WHOLLY MISSED OUT AND THE LOUD CHORDS AT THE END BEING HALF OF THEM FALSE BUT NOT THE LESS SATISFACTORY TO THE PERFORMER
MISSUS IS NOT WORSE IS SHE
BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE
NOT BUT WHAT SHE WILL BE BETTER TO-MORROW
BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED
YOU KNOW OR IF YOU DON'T YOUR POOR FATHER DID THAT YOU ARE TO HAVE MY MONEY AND GOODS WHEN I DIE
AT ELEVEN
HE WAS VERY SORRY TO HAVE TO DENY YOU THE OTHER DAY
I'LL HAVE NEW CHINTZ FOR HER BEDROOM AND MAKE IT LOOK NEW AND BRIGHT AND CHEER HER UP A LITTLE IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF KINDNESS MRS SHAW JOURNEYED TO MILTON OCCASIONALLY DREADING THE FIRST MEETING AND WONDERING HOW IT WOULD BE GOT OVER
NEIGHBOURS WHOM MRS SHAW CALLED FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO DINE WITH THEM MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WITH ANY OTHER PEOPLE AND BECAUSE IF SHE OR EDITH WANTED ANYTHING FROM THEM OR THEY FROM HER THEY DID NOT SCRUPLE TO MAKE A CALL AT EACH OTHER'S HOUSES BEFORE LUNCHEON
ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE TRAIN WOULD BE HERE
MISS HALE IS LYING ON THE DINING-ROOM SOFA BADLY HURT
THEN SHE BEGAN TO RECALL TO COMBINE TO WONDER
AND MISS HALE TOO
AND I TELL HIM SOME OF MY MIND THAT I RECKON HE'D HA BEEN THE BETTER OF HEARING WHEN HE WERE A YOUNGER MAN AND DOES HE NOT ANSWER YOU ASKED MR HALE
HER FATHER HAD SEEN ALL DUE PREPARATION MADE FOR HER REFRESHMENT ON HER RETURN
MARGARET WENT AND CALLED DIXON IN TERROR
BUT THE EYES WERE STILL CLOSED
SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN MR THORNTON SPOKE TO HER CLOSE AT HER ELBOW
SHE IS VERY PROUD OF MILTON
AND HERE WE GO DOWN DOWN DOWNEE NURSERY SONG
I AM A MAN
YOU NAUGHTY LITTLE GIRL
HAVE YOU TAKEN A HOUSE THERE NO HE REPLIED
BUT THEY NEITHER OF THEM KNEW THE REASON FOR HER LOW CONTINUED REFUSALS TO DO SO
GOOD-BYE MA'AM HE WAS GONE
NONE IN HIS WIFE EITHER I SHOULD GUESS FROM THEIR TONES THAT THEY HAD IRISH BLOOD IN THEM
BUT HE HAS SPENT HIS PROFITS IN EXTENDING IT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I OWN I AM WRONG ABOUT SCHOOLING
BUT WHO HAVE YOU HEARD ABUSING THE MASTERS MARGARET REDDENED
BUT THAT FALSEHOOD
SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE IMPENDING WEIGHT ON HER MIND ALL THE DAY LONG
SURELY HE MIGHT BRING EVIDENCE OF HIS GREAT PROVOCATION IT WOULD DO NO GOOD REPLIED MRS HALE
IT IS NOT MERELY THAT HE KNOWS OF MY FALSEHOOD BUT HE BELIEVES THAT SOME ONE ELSE CARES FOR ME
I AM GOING OUT FOR THE DAY TO BID FARMER DOBSON AND THE POOR PEOPLE ON BRACY COMMON GOOD-BYE
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE OLD LADY FALLING INTO THE CURRENT AND CARRIED AWAY BY HER DAUGHTER'S ENTHUSIASM FOR ORANGE-BLOSSOMS AND LACE
IT WAS A MIXTURE OF JOY OF ANGER OF PRIDE OF GLAD SURPRISE OF PANTING DOUBT
SHE HAD SATE DOWN UPON A PACKING CASE
I HARDLY CAN TELL WHAT TIME IT IS REPLIED DIXON IN AN AGGRIEVED TONE OF VOICE
BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT
SO THE WINTER WAS GETTING ON AND THE DAYS WERE BEGINNING TO LENGTHEN WITHOUT BRINGING WITH THEM ANY OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF HOPE WHICH USUALLY ACCOMPANIES THE RAYS OF A FEBRUARY SUN
THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN FIVE MINUTES
SHE TRIED TO COMFORT HERSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT WHAT HE IMAGINED HER TO BE DID NOT ALTER THE FACT OF WHAT SHE WAS
WHAT DID HE SAY
I SUPPOSE WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR OF OUR OWN
HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THE CHURCH AND LIVE IN MILTON-NORTHERN THERE WERE THE THREE HARD FACTS HARDLY SPOKEN
HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF A VERY ACTIVE FRIEND OF YOURS I CAN TELL YOU
MR COLTHURST WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN AND A RISING MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
THE LONDON TRAIN WHIZZED BY DREW BACK SOME YARDS AND IN MR BELL WAS HURRIED BY THE IMPATIENT GUARD
HER SOUL WOULD WALK IN GLORIOUS SUNLIGHT IF ANY MAN WAS WORTHY BY HIS POWER OF LOVING TO WIN BACK HER LOVE
YOU MUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE HER HERSELF
BUT SORE TROUBLE YOU HAVE HAD THESE MANY DAYS PAST TRADE IS BAD AND YOU DREAD I DREAD NOTHING REPLIED HE DRAWING UP HIS HEAD AND HOLDING IT ERECT
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO WALK TO CHURCH THROUGH THE SHADE OF TREES
BUT HE SAW HIS SISTER'S RESTLESS WAY OF CONTINUALLY ARRANGING SOME PART OF HER GOWN HER WANDERING EYES NOW GLANCING HERE NOW THERE BUT WITHOUT ANY PURPOSE IN HER OBSERVATION
NOW I YO SEE AM BOUND TO DO THE BEST I CAN HERE
SHE DID NOT FEEL AS IF ANY EXPLANATION COULD EVER REINSTATE HER--NOT IN HIS LOVE FOR THAT AND ANY RETURN ON HER PART SHE HAD RESOLVED NEVER TO DWELL UPON AND SHE KEPT RIGIDLY TO HER RESOLUTION--BUT IN THE RESPECT AND HIGH REGARD WHICH SHE HAD HOPED WOULD HAVE EVER MADE HIM WILLING IN THE SPIRIT OF GERALD GRIFFIN'S BEAUTIFUL LINES TO TURN AND LOOK BACK WHEN THOU HEAREST THE SOUND OF MY NAME SHE KEPT CHOKING AND SWALLOWING ALL THE TIME THAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
BUT WHAT WIN YE HAVE
A FEW MINUTES MORE AND THE SOLDIERS WILL BE HERE OH GOD CRIED MARGARET SUDDENLY
BUT I LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR SEEING CLEARLY AT LAST
HE FELT PRETTY SURE THAT IF THIS INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE HIS MOTHER'S ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED AT IT WOULD ONLY ANNOY AND CHAGRIN HIM THOUGH HE WOULD ALL THE TIME BE AWARE OF THE COLOURING WHICH IT RECEIVED BY PASSING THROUGH HER MIND
WE WILL KEEP THE CAB
SO I WAS AWARE OF WHAT WAS COMING
THERE'S THEORY FOR THEORY FOR YOU INDEED I HAVE NO THEORY
THEN THE CAPTAIN DECLARES HE MUST TAKE YOU AND HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW HOME
WE'RE BUT WHERE WE WAS
MARY HIGGINS HAD COME FOR THE THREE YOUNGEST AT DINNER-TIME
HE EXERTED HIMSELF DAY AND NIGHT TO FORESEE AND TO PROVIDE FOR ALL EMERGENCIES
MARGARET GAINED NO REAL DECISION FROM HIM
THE ACTION OF THE HEART MUST HAVE CEASED AS HE LAY DOWN
MARGARET HAD NOW AND THEN BEEN INTO THE CITY IN HER DRIVES WITH HER AUNT
LET US ASK HIM HOW BEST TO DO IT YOU PROMISED MARGARET NOT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AGO;--YOU SAID HE SHOULD COME AND SO HE SHALL MAMMA
HOW COULD YOU SAY SO MUTTERED HE REPROACHFULLY I'VE A GOOD MIND TO READ HIM THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER OF JOB NOT YET PAPA I THINK
BUT IT DID NOT SUIT MR LENNOX TO DRIVE HER TO THE FIRST OF THESE ALTERNATIVES
I TOOK THEM THERE TO DRY SAID MARGARET
SHE FORCED HERSELF TO SAY SOMETHING
AND AT ANY RATE AFTER HER FATHER'S DECISION
LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
SOMETIMES I THINK I WOULD RATHER NOT
WE WILL BE CALM AND STRONG
BUT DO NOT BE AFRAID OF TOO MUCH EXPRESSION ON MY PART I AM NOT AFRAID SHE REPLIED LIFTING HERSELF STRAIGHT UP
OR WISDOM EITHER
YET THESE FOOLS GO BACK TO THE PRICES PAID THREE YEARS AGO--NAY SOME OF THEIR LEADERS QUOTE DICKINSON'S PRICES NOW--THOUGH THEY KNOW AS WELL AS WE DO THAT WHAT WITH FINES PRESSED OUT OF THEIR WAGES AS NO HONOURABLE MAN WOULD EXTORT THEM AND OTHER WAYS WHICH I FOR ONE WOULD SCORN TO USE THE REAL RATE OF WAGE PAID AT DICKINSON'S IS LESS THAN AT OURS
HE HAD NOT YET FINISHED THE PEAR WHICH HE HAD DELICATELY PEELED IN ONE LONG STRIP OF SILVER-PAPER THINNESS AND WHICH HE WAS ENJOYING IN A DELIBERATE MANNER
QUICK THEY WERE WHIRLED OVER LONG STRAIGHT HOPELESS STREETS OF REGULARLY-BUILT HOUSES ALL SMALL AND OF BRICK
WHERE TO WHAT DISTANCE APART HAD HER FATHER WANDERED LED BY DOUBTS WHICH WERE TO HER TEMPTATIONS OF THE EVIL ONE
I THINK MR THORNTON JUDGES ME MORE MERCIFULLY THAN YOU;'--SHE HAD HARD WORK TO KEEP HERSELF FROM CHOKING WITH HER TEARS--'BUT I BELIEVE MADAM YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHTLY THANK YOU SAID MRS THORNTON DRAWING HERSELF UP
BUT I BELIEVE I RELY ON THE STRAIGHTFORWARD HONESTY OF MY HANDS AND THE OPEN NATURE OF THEIR OPPOSITION IN CONTRA-DISTINCTION TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE TURNOUT WILL BE MANAGED IN SOME MILLS JUST BECAUSE THEY KNOW I SCORN TO TAKE A SINGLE DISHONOURABLE ADVANTAGE OR DO AN UNDERHAND THING MYSELF
SHE LOOKED A VERY PRETTY LADY-LIKE WOMAN AS SHE GREETED MR LENNOX WITH THE CORDIALITY DUE TO ONE WHO WAS ALMOST A RELATION
I SHALL LIKE IT IF YOU WON'T BE LONELY WITHOUT ME PAPA NO NO
OH MARGARET LET ME SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE MARGARET DID NOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE UTTERLY UNREASONABLE IN THIS SPEECH
MARGARET HAS HAD A LAWYER'S LETTER AND SHE IS RESIDUARY LEGATEE--THE LEGACIES BEING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE REMAINDER ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROPERTY IN MILTON INDEED
AND I WILL ASSUREDLY PROTECT ALL OTHERS WHO COME TO ME FOR WORK
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE RESTED AT NAPLES IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT IT WAS
WHY SAID HE THE AMERICANS ARE GETTING THEIR YARNS SO INTO THE GENERAL MARKET THAT OUR ONLY CHANCE IS PRODUCING THEM AT A LOWER RATE
HE WISHED TOO BUT OF THIS WISH HE WAS RATHER ASHAMED THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD JUSTIFIED HER WISDOM IN SENDING HIGGINS TO HIM TO ASK FOR WORK
SHE HEARD NO SOUND OF VOICES AND ALMOST FEARED SHE MIGHT HAVE DREAMT
THE COURSE OF MARGARET'S DAY WAS THIS
SHE WAS IN A HUMOUR TO ENJOY SHOWING HER LOVER HOW WELL SHE COULD BEHAVE AS A SOLDIER'S WIFE
BUT NOW HEARING HIM SPEAK INSIDE THEY SET UP SUCH A FIERCE UNEARTHLY GROAN THAT EVEN MRS THORNTON WAS WHITE WITH FEAR AS SHE PRECEDED HIM INTO THE ROOM
I WANTED TO ASK YO TO BE A FRIEND TO HER
PLEASE SAID SHE LAYING A LIGHT BUT DETERMINED HAND ON HIS ARM
BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF IMMEDIATELY
SHE WENT HASTILY TO HER BROTHER WHO WAS STANDING OUTSIDE AND TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM
IT WAS THE FIVE HOURS OF WAITING THAT STRUCK MR THORNTON
I MIGHT AS WELL PUT A FIREBRAND INTO THE MIDST OF THE COTTON-WASTE HIGGINS TURNED AWAY
HOW HE TALKED OF HIS WALLIS PACK UP A CARPET-BAG FOR ME IN FIVE MINUTES
LET US HOPE AS LONG AS WE CAN
AND I'LL GET IT THIS TIME
IN HER NERVOUS AGITATION SHE UNCONSCIOUSLY OPENED A BOOK OF HER FATHER'S THAT LAY UPON THE TABLE,--THE WORDS THAT CAUGHT HER EYE IN IT SEEMED ALMOST MADE FOR HER PRESENT STATE OF ACUTE SELF-ABASEMENT JE NE VOUDROIS PAS REPRENDRE MON COEUR EN CESTE SORTE
I WAS UNWILLING TO CONSENT TO DO IT WHEN YOUR MOTHER ASKED ME
YET ON SATURDAY SHE LOOKED AS WELL AS SHE DOES NOW
BUT IT TOOK OFF HER THOUGHTS FROM TOO IMPATIENTLY DWELLING UPON HER DESIRE TO HAVE ALL EXPLAINED TO MR THORNTON
SHE SHOULD HAVE ALL WOMANLY CARE ALL GENTLE TENDANCE
YOU DON'T MEAN HE WOULD REFUSE ME THIS LAST WISH--PRAYER IF YOU WILL
DON'T FIDGET YOURSELF AND I'LL ARRANGE IT ALL BEFORE THEY LEFT MARGARET STOLE ROUND TO THE BACK OF THE VICARAGE GARDEN AND GATHERED A LITTLE STRAGGLING PIECE OF HONEYSUCKLE
SO I TOLD HIM
HE SHOOK HIMSELF HEAVILY GAVE THEM ONE MORE SULLEN LOOK SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT MADE FOR THE DOOR
THAT I KNEW FREDERICK WERE SAFE A DEEP OBSERVER OF HUMAN COUNTENANCES MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE MOMENTARY AGONY SHOOT OUT OF HER GREAT GLOOMY EYES LIKE THE TORTURE OF SOME CREATURE BROUGHT TO BAY
HE EXULTED IN THE POWER HE SHOWED IN COMPELLING HIMSELF TO FACE HER WHENEVER HE COULD THINK OF ANY ACTION WHICH MIGHT GIVE HER FATHER OR MOTHER PLEASURE
HE DREAMT OF HER
THEN HE SAID I REALLY DON'T KNOW
FIND ME SOME ONE ELSE TO GO BUT THAT GIRL MUST NOT BLEED TO DEATH BLEED
IT HAD BEEN HEAVY IN WEIGHT AND LONG CARRIED
NOW THAT CAME BACK AND SEEMED TO TAKE AWAY HER BREATH
NOW--AS HE PAUSED BEFORE GOING ON SHE SAID ALMOST AS IF SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM IN TELLING HIS TALE--'WELL--GO ON IT IS SUPPOSED THAT AN INQUEST WILL HAVE TO BE HELD
BUT SHE HAD AN INDESCRIBABLE CHILDLIKE SWEETNESS OF HEART WHICH MADE HER MANNERS EVEN IN HER RARELY WILFUL MOODS IRRESISTIBLE OF OLD
BUT MARGARET WAS AT AN AGE WHEN ANY APPREHENSION NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE
BUT THE NEXT SHE INSISTED ON GETTING UP
YO NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSEL SIR SAID NICHOLAS
ALL THESE WEEKS SHE HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF THEIR EXISTENCE IN A DULL KIND OF WAY THOUGH THEY WERE HIDDEN OUT OF SIGHT
THANK YOU EXCLAIMED MARGARET
IT WERE A NECESSITY
TRUSTING TO HERSELF SHE HAD FALLEN
SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
BUT THE IDEAS CAME SLOWLY FOR THEIR BRAINS WERE DULL AND LANGUID OF PERCEPTION
WE ARE ONLY TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR YOUR BEING SO FOND OF MILTON THANK YOU SAID MRS THORNTON
HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER IN SUCH DRESS BEFORE AND YET NOW IT APPEARED AS IF SUCH ELEGANCE OF ATTIRE WAS SO BEFITTING HER NOBLE FIGURE AND LOFTY SERENITY OF COUNTENANCE THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO ALWAYS THUS APPARELLED
A DOOR WAS OPENED IN A CARRIAGE--HE JUMPED IN
BUT YOU SHALL NOT DRIVE ME OFF UPON THAT AND SO ESCAPE THE EXPRESSION OF MY DEEP GRATITUDE MY HE WAS ON THE VERGE NOW
YO MAY SEE A GOOD USE AS YO THINK TO PUT YO'R MONEY TO
BUT SHE WOULDN'T DO EITHER--NOT SHE
THORNTON SAID--SAYS HE A DAY OR TWO AGO HIGGINS HAVE YO SEEN MISS HALE NO SAYS I
THEN I COULD HAVE HAD FRED IN MY ARMS EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY AND HIS COT WAS CLOSE BY MY BED
AND NEVER GAVE HERSELF BREATHING-TIME TILL THE BASKET WAS SENT OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT I DON'T THINK GOD ENDUED ME WITH OVER-MUCH WISDOM OR STRENGTH HE ADDED FALLING BACK INTO HIS OLD POSITION
P.S.--WHAT AN ESCAPE THAT WAS
BUT NEVER LET ME HEAR ANY ONE SAY A WORD AGAINST HER IMPLYING ANY MORE SERIOUS IMPUTATION THAN THAT SHE NOW NEEDS THE COUNSEL OF SOME KIND AND GENTLE WOMAN
YO COULD MAY BE HELP ME TO WORK
HER EYE CAUGHT ON A BEE ENTERING A DEEP-BELLED FLOWER
EVENTUALLY HE WOULD EARN SUCH SUCCESS AND SUCH HONOURS AS WOULD ENABLE HIM TO PAY HER BACK WITH INTEREST THAT FIRST ADVANCE IN WEALTH WHICH HE SHOULD OWE TO HER
AND I THINK JUSTLY
THE DAY AFTER THIS MEETING WITH HIGGINS AND HIS DAUGHTER MR HALE CAME UPSTAIRS INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM AT AN UNUSUAL HOUR
AND YET IT SEEMED SO RIGHT AT THE TIME
I WILL WATCH OVER HIM LIKE A LIONESS OVER HER YOUNG WHEN CAN WE HEAR FROM HIM NOT FOR A WEEK YET CERTAINLY,--PERHAPS MORE WE MUST SEND MARTHA AWAY IN GOOD TIME
BEFORE THE THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY MR HALE GOT UP
SHE LIFTED THE THIN SOFT HAIR FROM OFF THE TEMPLES AND BATHED THEM WITH WATER
SO HERE WE STAND WAITING FOR THEIR NEXT ATTACK AND WHAT WILL THAT BE ASKED MR HALE
WILL YOU JUST READ IT TO ME HE READ IT ALOUD TO HER
THE ONE BECAUSE THE PRESENT IS SO LIVING AND HURRYING AND CLOSE AROUND HIM
MRS THORNTON WILL SEND THE WATER-BED MAMMA DEAR HOW TIRED YOU LOOK
SHE IN SPANISH-ENGLISH AS WAS BUT NATURAL AND HE WITH LITTLE TURNS AND INVERSIONS OF WORDS WHICH PROVED HOW FAR THE IDIOMS OF HIS BRIDE'S COUNTRY WERE INFECTING HIM
MARGARET HAD JOINED THE PARTY IN THE EVENING
AND YEAR BY YEAR OUR MEMORY FADES FROM ALL THE CIRCLE OF THE HILLS TENNYSON
DON'T THINK OF ME
WITH SWEET PATIENCE DID SHE BEAR HER PAIN WITHOUT A WORD OF COMPLAINT
TAKE CARE OF HER FOR SHE IS A VERY PRECIOUS CREATURE,--A GREAT DEAL TOO GOOD FOR MILTON,--ONLY FIT FOR OXFORD IN FACT
SO HE AND MARGARET WALKED IN SILENCE
SHE HAD AN INDESCRIBABLE REPUGNANCE TO THIS STEP BEING TAKEN
NO MORE REMOVALS IN THIS LIFE
HER MOTHER WAS A SPANIARD I BELIEVE
YOU DON'T MEET WITH ANY SELF-SUFFICIENCY AMONG THE LAWYERS FOR INSTANCE ASKED MR BELL
THEY KNOW ME BY THIS TIME
MERE DEMAGOGUES LOVERS OF POWER AT WHATEVER COST TO OTHERS WELL SIR
YOU FORGOT YOURSELF IN THOUGHT FOR ANOTHER
HIS BROTHER SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND MRS SHAW WELCOMED HIM IN HER GENTLE KINDLY WAY WHICH HAD ALWAYS SOMETHING PLAINTIVE IN IT ARISING FROM THE LONG HABIT OF CONSIDERING HERSELF A VICTIM TO AN UNCONGENIAL MARRIAGE
SO I SUPPOSE LIKE GOOD LITTLE CHILDREN WE SHALL DO AS WE ARE BID--SOME TIME BUT I THINK YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD ALTERED YOUR CHIMNEYS SO AS TO CONSUME THE SMOKE DID YOU NOT ASKED MR HALE
BUT THE MONOTONOUS LIFE LED BY INVALIDS OFTEN MAKES THEM LIKE CHILDREN INASMUCH AS THEY HAVE NEITHER OF THEM ANY SENSE OF PROPORTION IN EVENTS AND SEEM EACH TO BELIEVE THAT THE WALLS AND CURTAINS WHICH SHUT IN THEIR WORLD AND SHUT OUT EVERYTHING ELSE MUST OF NECESSITY BE LARGER THAN ANYTHING HIDDEN BEYOND
HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP-BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL I AM SURPRISED AT YOU MARGARET SAID HER MOTHER
BUT IT IS HARD TO FEEL HOW COMPLETELY HE MUST MISUNDERSTAND ME
HE TOOK UP HIS HAT
BUT ALL AT ONCE MARGARET SAW THAT HER FATHER WAS INDEED UNABLE
YOU HAVE MADE HIM WHAT HE IS MADE HIM WHAT HE IS
AS FOR SITTING STILL AND LEARNING FROM THE PAST OR SHAPING OUT THE FUTURE BY FAITHFUL WORK DONE IN A PROPHETIC SPIRIT--WHY
AS DIXON RETURNED UP THE PASSAGE MARGARET PASSED HER SWIFTLY
WHEN SUDDENLY THIS HIGGINS CAME TO ME AND GRACIOUSLY SIGNIFIED HIS APPROVAL OF A SCHEME SO NEARLY THE SAME AS MINE THAT I MIGHT FAIRLY HAVE CLAIMED IT
THERE WAS NOT A BOOK ABOUT IN THE ROOM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MATTHEW HENRY'S BIBLE COMMENTARIES SIX VOLUMES OF WHICH LAY IN THE CENTRE OF THE MASSIVE SIDE-BOARD FLANKED BY A TEA-URN ON ONE SIDE AND A LAMP ON THE OTHER
YOU DO WELL SAID HE
HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF ON A CHAIR CLOSE TO THE DOOR
YOU HEAR WHAT SHE SAID WITH HER LAST BREATH
AND HER SCOLDING WAS NOT THE LESS ENERGETIC BECAUSE IT WAS DELIVERED IN AN ANGRY WHISPER
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT
AND ONE GOING DOWN DRAGS MANY AFTER
SHE WAS EVIDENTLY A STRANGER TO THE HOUSE A NEW-COMER IN THE DISTRICT INDEED
SHE LOVED YO DEARLY
THEY'VE TURNED TO THE MILL-DOOR MR THORNTON SAID MARGARET SHAKING ALL OVER WITH HER PASSION GO DOWN THIS INSTANT IF YOU ARE NOT A COWARD
SHE HAS FAINTED--THAT'S ALL IT'S AS WELL FOR HER POOR CREATURE SAID A WOMAN FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF THE BEARERS OF THE DEAD
I AM HAPPY TO SAY I DID NOT PROMISE KINDNESS AND GENTLENESS FOR I FELT AT THE TIME THAT IT MIGHT BE OUT OF MY POWER TO RENDER THESE TO ONE OF MISS HALE'S CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION
SOME IDLE-LOOKING YOUNG MEN WERE LOUNGING ABOUT WITH THE STATIONMASTER
HE HAD LOOKS WORDS HAND-CLEAVINGS LIES CONCEALMENT ALL TO HIMSELF
IF YOU LIKE TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND MORBID BE SO
IS HELSTONE A VILLAGE OR A TOWN IN THE FIRST PLACE OH ONLY A HAMLET
HE GAVE SHORT SHARP ANSWERS
THIS IS THE LAST I'LL SEE
I DID NOT BELIEVE YOU
CRUEL AND THOUGHTLESS,--CRUEL BECAUSE THEY WERE THOUGHTLESS
IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO THINK OF YOU AS A FRIEND BUT I MAY HOPE MAY I NOT MARGARET THAT SOME TIME YOU WILL THINK OF ME AS A LOVER
THEN SHE TURNED AND SPOKE AGAIN FOR GOD'S SAKE
BUT INSTEAD HE ADDED I'M AFEARED HOO SPEAKS TRUTH
YOU'RE NEVER THINKING OF MARRYING HER?--A GIRL WITHOUT A PENNY SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ME SAID HE WITH A SHORT LAUGH
YOU WON'T RISK IT IF YOU DO
YOUR FIGURE AND WAY OF HOLDING YOURSELF IS CAPITAL
MAMMA I WILL WRITE TO-NIGHT AND TELL FREDERICK WHAT YOU SAY
I WILL LEARN ANYTHING DIXON CAN TEACH ME
BUT SUCH A ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEPLY MISTAKEN
I REMEMBER EATING SLOES AND CRABS WITH A RELISH
I HOPE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET NEW PAPERS MARGARET HOPED SO TOO THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
AND AS TO MR THORNTON'S BEING IN TRADE WHY HE CAN'T HELP THAT NOW POOR FELLOW
AND SO WHEN THE PAROXYSMS CAME ON EACH MORE SEVERE THAN THE LAST THEY WERE FRESH AGONIES AND GREATER DISAPPOINTMENTS TO HIM
HE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN ALL HER FATHER SAID OF DEATH AND OF THE HEAVY LULL AND OF THE BRAIN THAT HAS GROWN DULL IT WAS CURIOUS HOW THE PRESENCE OF MR THORNTON HAD POWER OVER MR HALE TO MAKE HIM UNLOCK THE SECRET THOUGHTS WHICH HE KEPT SHUT UP EVEN FROM MARGARET
SHE CAME CLOSE UP TO THEM BEFORE SHE COULD TRUST HERSELF TO SPEAK
HE HAD HAD EXAGGERATED IDEAS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HIS ALTERED OPINIONS MIGHT MAKE IN HIS FRIENDS RECEPTION OF HIM
I WILL GO WHILE YOU ARE TAKING YOUR NAP
A WOMAN OF STRONG POWER AND FIRM RESOLVE
WHO AFTER DELIBERATELY MARRYING GENERAL SHAW WITH NO WARMER FEELING THAN RESPECT FOR HIS CHARACTER AND ESTABLISHMENT WAS CONSTANTLY THOUGH QUIETLY BEMOANING HER HARD LOT IN BEING UNITED TO ONE WHOM SHE COULD NOT LOVE
HE WAS MY FIRST BABY MARGARET MRS HALE SPOKE WISTFULLY AND ALMOST AS IF APOLOGISING FOR THE YEARNING CRAVING WISH AS THOUGH IT WERE A DEPRECIATION OF HER REMAINING CHILD
AND THEN YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD ME IN THE KITCHEN AND THE DOORS INTO THE LANE AND CHURCHYARD ARE LOCKED LONG AGO OH MISS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURE TO HAVE MISSED YOU SOON
IT DEPENDS ON CONSTITUTION
NATURE FELT NO CHANGE AND WAS EVER YOUNG
ABOUT WHAT HE COULD NOT HEAR
IT MAY BE TRUE OR IT MAY NOT
READ ABOUT THE NEW HEAVENS AND THE NEW EARTH
IT WAS HIS WAY OF SHOWING SYMPATHY
IT WAS ASTONISHING ALMOST STUNNING TO FEEL HERSELF SO MUCH AT LIBERTY
HE HAD THE GREATEST MIND IN THE WORLD TO GET UP AND GO OUT OF THE ROOM THAT VERY INSTANT AND NEVER SET FOOT IN THE HOUSE AGAIN
BURIED
MY SON WAS ENGAGED UP TO THE LAST MOMENT ON BUSINESS
BOUCHER WERE A FOOL ALL ALONG AND NE'ER A WORSE FOOL THAN AT TH LAST HE DID YOU HARM ASKED MARGARET
AN I SAY AGAIN THERE'S NO HELP FOR US BUT HAVING FAITH I TH UNION
SHE HAS SHOWN HIM INTO MASTER'S STUDY
THAT'S THE ONLY OBJECTION I ANTICIPATED
MARGARET WAS RECALLED TO A SENSE OF THE PRESENT BY SOME TRIVIAL LOW-SPOKEN REMARK OF HER MOTHER'S
LAST AUTUMN SHE WAS FATIGUED WITH A WALK OF A COUPLE OF MILES
BUT NO ONE CAME NEAR HER UNTIL THE TRAIN DREW UP
BUT I'VE GETTEN SIX CHILDREN SIR AND THE ELDEST NOT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE
BENDING HER WHOLE SOUL TO SYMPATHISE IN ALL THE VARIOUS TURNS HER FEELINGS TOOK
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS THAT MR HALE HAS GONE TO
BUT FATHER SAYS YO'RE JUST LIKE TH REST ON EM
IT IS ONLY ME CHARLOTTE HER HEART DID NOT STILL ITS FLUTTERING TILL SHE WAS SAFE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WITH THE WINDOWS FASTENED AND BOLTED AND THE FAMILIAR WALLS HEMMING HER ROUND AND SHUTTING HER IN
BUT HE SPOKE ABOUT HIMSELF SO SIMPLY--WITH SO LITTLE OF THE PRETENCE THAT MAKES THE VULGARITY OF SHOP-PEOPLE AND WITH SUCH TENDER RESPECT FOR HIS MOTHER THAT I WAS LESS LIKELY TO LEAVE THE ROOM THEN THAN WHEN HE WAS BOASTING ABOUT MILTON AS IF THERE WAS NOT SUCH ANOTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD
THEN HE LOOKED UP
BUT HE MIGHT HA BEEN BACK AFORE THIS OR SENT ME SOME WORD IF HE'D GETTEN WORK
THEY WERE AT THE LOWEST NOW
AND THOUGH I DON'T PRETEND I CAN LOVE HER AS YOU DO YET I LOVED HER BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MAN WOMAN OR CHILD--NO ONE BUT MASTER FREDERICK EVER CAME NEAR HER IN MY MIND
AN INDEPENDENT CHARACTER
AFTER HIS DEATH IT WAS FOUND TO BE TRUE
AND THEN TO SPEAK TO MARGARET AS HE HAD DONE
AND HE WERE SORRY
WHAT IS IT
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
WHY DID MY FATHER LEAVE HELSTONE
YOU ARE QUITE PREJUDICED AGAINST MR THORNTON MARGARET HE IS THE FIRST SPECIMEN OF A MANUFACTURER--OF A PERSON ENGAGED IN TRADE--THAT I HAD EVER THE OPPORTUNITY OF STUDYING PAPA
AND THAT YOU MAY COME AND THANK ME FOR IT INSTEAD OF PERCEIVING AS A GENTLEMAN WOULD--YES
DOUBTLESS HE WAS WITH MISS HALE
YOU YOU SAID MARGARET
AND AS I HAVE NO THOUGHT OR EXPECTATION OF EVER ASKING HER TO BE MY WIFE YOU'LL BELIEVE ME FOR THE FUTURE THAT I'M QUITE DISINTERESTED IN SPEAKING ABOUT HER
THERE ARE MANY THINGS MORE UNLIKELY I SHOULD SAY REPLIED MR BELL
A MAN LEADS A DREE LIFE WHO'S NOT I TH UNION
BUT THE SHORT CURLED UPPER LIP THE ROUND MASSIVE UP-TURNED CHIN THE MANNER OF CARRYING HER HEAD HER MOVEMENTS FULL OF A SOFT FEMININE DEFIANCE ALWAYS GAVE STRANGERS THE IMPRESSION OF HAUGHTINESS
AND I AM JEALOUS OF THESE PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO VALUE THE PRIVILEGE OF THEIR RIGHT
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY HAVING DOUBTS SHE ASKED
AND I CAN PROTECT MYSELF FROM ANY VIOLENCE THAT I APPREHEND
MARGARET SITTING IN BURNING SILENCE VEXED AND ASHAMED OF HER DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING HER RIGHT PLACE AND HER CALM UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF HEART WHEN MR THORNTON WAS BY HEARD HER MOTHER'S SLOW ENTREATY THAT MRS THORNTON WOULD COME AND SEE HER
EVEN THE HIGGINSES--SO LONG A VIVID INTEREST--SEEMED TO HAVE RECEDED FROM ANY NEED OF IMMEDIATE THOUGHT
WE WILL HAVE YOU BACK AT HELSTONE YET NO NEVER
SHE HAD EDITH'S PLACE ON THE SOFA
HE COULD ALMOST DEFY HIS HEART
AND THE DISLIKE HE HAD TO THE LATTER SEEMED TO ENVELOPE AND DISFIGURE THE FORMER
OR RATHER SHE IS COMING INTO THE SNARE AND YOU WILL CATCH HER TO-MORROW IF YOU'RE SKILFUL WHAT DO YOU MEAN MR HALE ASKED HIS WIFE HER CURIOSITY AROUSED
THE WHOLE ROOM HAD A PAINFULLY SPOTTED SPANGLED SPECKLED LOOK ABOUT IT WHICH IMPRESSED MARGARET SO UNPLEASANTLY THAT SHE WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE PECULIAR CLEANLINESS REQUIRED TO KEEP EVERYTHING SO WHITE AND PURE IN SUCH AN ATMOSPHERE OR OF THE TROUBLE THAT MUST BE WILLINGLY EXPENDED TO SECURE THAT EFFECT OF ICY SNOWY DISCOMFORT
IT IS NEARLY SEVEN SHE SAID
FANCIED OR NOT FANCIED--I QUESTION NOT MYSELF TO KNOW WHICH--I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT I OWE MY VERY LIFE TO YOU--AY--SMILE AND THINK IT AN EXAGGERATION IF YOU WILL
IF THEY DON'T SEE THEIR MADNESS BEFORE THE END OF THAT TIME I MUST HAVE HANDS FROM IRELAND
BUT SHE TOOK HIS OLD GOUTY HAND AND KISSED IT
HE DARED NOT ASK HER TO ACCOMPANY HIM BACK TO OXFORD WHICH HAD BEEN ONE OF THE PLANS HE HAD FORMED ON THE JOURNEY TO MILTON HER PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION WAS EVIDENTLY TOO COMPLETE FOR HER TO UNDERTAKE ANY SUCH FATIGUE--PUTTING THE SIGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO ENCOUNTER OUT OF THE QUESTION
SHE DOUBTED ANY WANT BEYOND A MOMENTARY FANCY ON THAT LADY'S PART WHICH SHOULD TAKE HER OUT OF HER PREVIOUSLY SETTLED COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THE DAY
I KNOW IT MOANED SHE TURNING HER HEAD UNEASILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
I'LL GO AND MAKE HIM AS COMFORTABLE AS I CAN AND DO YOU ATTEND TO YOUR MOTHER
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WAS SELFISHNESS ENOUGH IN HIM TO HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN THE IDEA THAT HIS GREAT LOVE MIGHT COME IN TO COMFORT AND CONSOLE HER
AT LENGTH HE STOPPED AND REPLIED
AH MISSY
THEY WERE WATCHING OPEN-EYED AND OPEN-MOUTHED THE THREAD OF DARK-RED BLOOD WHICH WAKENED THEM UP FROM THEIR TRANCE OF PASSION
HOO WERE MISTOOK AND I WERE MISLED
SHE TURNED AWAY AND RAN UP-STAIRS AND CRIED MOST HEARTILY
HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE SILENT RESPECT PAID TO HIM
EVERYBODY HERE IS YOUNG AND WELL AND OUR SKIES ARE ALWAYS BLUE AND OUR SUN ALWAYS SHINES AND THE BAND PLAYS DELICIOUSLY FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
AND I THINK I COULD BEAR UP AGAINST--AT ANY RATE I COULD HAVE THE ENERGY TO RESENT MRS THORNTON'S UNJUST IMPERTINENT SUSPICIONS
TRUE THAT WAS BAD I OWN
IT WOULD NOT SATISFY HIM TO AVOID HIGGINS
HE HELD HER TO HIM FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
I AM DISAPPOINTED IN HIM THERE WAS A SLIGHT NOISE BEHIND HER
AND BESIDES AUNT SHAW WON'T LIKE US TO TALK EDITH PLAYED BRILLIANTLY
BUT WHEN I SAW MASTER SITTING SO STIFF AND WITH HIS EYES SO GLAZED AND SAD I THOUGHT IT MIGHT ROUSE HIM TO HAVE TO THINK OF MASTER FREDERICK'S SAFETY A BIT
I HAD BETTER GO AND TAKE MAMMA UP THIS CUP OF TEA
AND WITH THIS NEW FRIGHT I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER HURRY OFF FRED TO LONDON WHERE AS YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT WE SAID THE OTHER NIGHT HE WAS TO GO TO CONSULT MR LENNOX AS TO HIS CHANCES IF HE STOOD THE TRIAL
I SHOULD BE IN A PERPETUAL TERROR MISS LEST I SHOULD BE CONVERTED OH SAID MARGARET I DO NOT KNOW THAT I AM GOING
HE LOVED HER AND WOULD LOVE HER
MARGARET HAVE I STARTLED YOU TOO MUCH
AND THE ARRANGEMENTS WE HAVE TO MAKE TO-MORROW ARE OF IMPORTANCE NO ONE EVER KNEW WHY MR LENNOX DID NOT KEEP TO HIS APPOINTMENT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
THE OTHER CHILDREN CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN AFFRIGHT BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERY OF THE SCENE
HOW COULD I
HE HAD MOVED AWAY FROM BEHIND HER AS IF JEALOUS OF ANYTHING THAT SHOULD COME BETWEEN HIM AND DANGER
ET REMETTONS-NOUS AU CHEMIN DE L'HUMILITE
A DARK CLOUD CAME OVER HIS FACE WHILE HE LISTENED
AND SEE WHO'LL WORK FOR EM THEN
LIFTED UP HIS STOUT OLD LIMBS STIFF WITH TRAVELLING FROM THEIR EASY POSITION AND FOLLOWED DIXON OUT OF THE ROOM
SO MARGARET ROSE UP AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO UNDRESS HERSELF FEELING THE FULL LUXURY OF ACTING LEISURELY LATE AS IT WAS AFTER ALL THE PAST HURRY OF THE DAY
YOU DID NOT SEE WHAT I SAW IF SHE THOUGHT HER SEX WOULD BE A PROTECTION,--IF WITH SHRINKING EYES SHE HAD TURNED AWAY FROM THE TERRIBLE ANGER OF THESE MEN IN ANY HOPE THAT ERE SHE LOOKED AGAIN THEY WOULD HAVE PAUSED AND REFLECTED AND SLUNK AWAY AND VANISHED,--SHE WAS WRONG
AND MRS HEPWORTH PROPOSED TO MARGARET THAT SHE AND MR BELL SHOULD ACCOMPANY HER TO THE PARSONAGE AND SEE THE--THE WORD IMPROVEMENTS HAD HALF SLIPPED OUT OF HER MOUTH BUT SHE SUBSTITUTED THE MORE CAUTIOUS TERM ALTERATIONS WHICH THE PRESENT VICAR WAS MAKING
THEN YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF HOW BEAUTIFUL HELSTONE IS
AND OFTEN WHEN HIS EYE FELL ON HIGGINS HE COULD HAVE SPOKEN ANGRILY TO HIM WITHOUT ANY PRESENT CAUSE JUST FROM FEELING HOW SERIOUS WAS THE INJURY THAT HAD ARISEN FROM THIS AFFAIR IN WHICH HE WAS IMPLICATED
WE WHO
HER EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BLINDED BY TEARS BUT SHE HAD NO TIME TO GIVE WAY TO REGULAR CRYING
OF COURSE SHE COULD ANSWER AND ANSWER THE RIGHT THING
COME ALONG BESS
MARGARET SAID HE TAKING HER BY SURPRISE AND GETTING SUDDEN POSSESSION OF HER HAND SO THAT SHE WAS FORCED TO STAND STILL AND LISTEN DESPISING HERSELF FOR THE FLUTTERING AT HER HEART ALL THE TIME
YOU'VE STUDIED HER HAVE YOU
FOR THE EVIDENCE WAS SO UNCERTAIN YOU SEE THAT THE MAN HAD RECEIVED ANY BLOW AT ALL,--AND IF ANY QUESTION OF IDENTITY CAME IN IT SO COMPLICATED THE CASE AS I TOLD MR THORNTON MR THORNTON SAID MARGARET AGAIN
AND THEN SITTING DOWN ON THE BOTTOM STAIR HE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING SHOES AND WITHOUT A WORD WALKED UP-STAIRS
I SHALL BE BETTER WHEN TO-MORROW IS OVER I FEEL SURE DARLING YOU WON'T BE BETTER TILL I GET YOU OUT OF THIS HORRID AIR
NOR WAS THE HOUSEHOLD IN WHICH SHE LIVED ONE THAT CALLED FOR MUCH DECISION
AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DIFFICULTY IN SAYING WHAT HE CAME TO SAY
YO'VE HIT THE BULL'S EYE
I HAVE KNOWN THE TIME WHEN I HAVE HAD TO THREAD MY WAY THROUGH A CROWD OF WHITE ANGRY MEN ALL SWEARING THEY WOULD HAVE MAKINSON'S BLOOD AS SOON AS HE VENTURED TO SHOW HIS NOSE OUT OF HIS FACTORY
POOR FOLK CAN LOVE THEIR CHILDER AS WELL AS RICH
FOLK GOT INTO TH MANAGEMENT OF IT AS WERE EITHER FOOLS OR NOT TRUE MEN
THAT'S WHAT I CALL A FINE GIRL THOUGHT DR DONALDSON WHEN HE WAS SEATED IN HIS CARRIAGE AND HAD TIME TO EXAMINE HIS RINGED HAND WHICH HAD SLIGHTLY SUFFERED FROM HER PRESSURE
ONE ROOM ALONE IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SQUARE YARDS I MEANT THAT THE SMOKE AND THE NOISE--THE CONSTANT GOING OUT AND COMING IN OF THE WORK-PEOPLE MIGHT BE ANNOYING I AGREE WITH YOU MR HALE SAID FANNY
WE ALL KNEW YOU WOULD COME
FIRST CLASS STAND UP FOR A PARSING LESSON WITH MISS HALE POOR MARGARET WHOSE VISIT WAS SENTIMENTAL NOT IN ANY DEGREE INSPECTIVE FELT HERSELF TAKEN IN
WHO HAS PROMISED TO BE A FATHER TO THE FATHERLESS CONTINUED HE
FREDERICK'S WORLDLY POSITION WAS RAISED BY THIS MARRIAGE ON TO AS HIGH A LEVEL AS THEY COULD DESIRE
SHE HEARD CHARLOTTE SHUTTING THE WINDOWS AND FASTENING UP FOR THE NIGHT UNCONSCIOUS THAT ANY ONE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE GARDEN
IF EVER I SEE HER DOING WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE WRONG--SUCH WRONG NOT TOUCHING ME OR MINE IN WHICH CASE I MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN INTERESTED MOTIVE--I WILL TELL HER OF IT FAITHFULLY AND PLAINLY AS I SHOULD WISH MY OWN DAUGHTER TO BE TOLD THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE
AND CAPTAIN LENNOX CAME AND WITH HIM NEWS OF EDITH AND THE LITTLE BOY
BUT THAT'S NONSENSE YOU KNOW AND WILL SOON GO OFF
I WAS SURE HE WAS ILL FROM THE WHOLE TONE OF HIS LETTERS AND YET HE WOULD NOT ANSWER ME WHEN I ASKED HIM AND I HAD NO THIRD PERSON TO WHOM I COULD APPLY FOR NEWS OH
BUT WHERE IS HE HIMSELF I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE PLACE BUT HE IS NOT CALLED HALE
IF SHE SPOKE HE GAVE NO SIGN OF ATTENTION AND YET HIS NEXT SPEECH TO ANY ONE ELSE WAS MODIFIED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID
SHE HAS THE MAKING OF A CLEOPATRA IN HER IF ONLY SHE WERE A LITTLE MORE PAGAN FOR MY PART SAID EDITH A LITTLE MALICIOUSLY I AM VERY GLAD SHE IS A CHRISTIAN
FAR AWAY IN THE EAST AND IN THE WEST WHERE HIS PERSON WOULD NEVER BE KNOWN HIS NAME WAS TO BE REGARDED AND HIS WISHES TO BE FULFILLED AND HIS WORD PASS LIKE GOLD
LET THEM TURN OUT
FREDERICK WOULD BE AS MUCH ON HIS GUARD AS SHE COULD PUT HIM
THE OTHER BECAUSE HIS LIFE TEMPTS HIM TO REVEL IN THE MERE SENSE OF ANIMAL EXISTENCE NOT KNOWING OF AND CONSEQUENTLY NOT CARING FOR ANY PUNGENCY OF PLEASURE FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH HE CAN PLAN AND DENY HIMSELF AND LOOK FORWARD AND THUS BOTH THE NECESSITY FOR ENGROSSMENT AND THE STUPID CONTENT IN THE PRESENT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECTS
AND IN FEELING AS HE HAD INDEED SAID TO HER THAT THOUGH SHE MIGHT DESPISE HIM CONTEMN HIM TREAT HIM WITH HER PROUD SOVEREIGN INDIFFERENCE HE DID NOT CHANGE ONE WHIT
NO INVALID TO PLAN AND THINK FOR
A STONE HAS GRAZED HER TEMPLE
OH RUN
BUT IF THE SPARKS LIGHT ON SOME COMBUSTIBLE MATTER THEY SMOULDER FIRST AND BURST OUT INTO A FRIGHTFUL FLAME AT LAST
HE WAS THE PRIDE AND PLAYTHING OF BOTH FATHER AND MOTHER AS LONG AS HE WAS GOOD
WHATTEN BUSINESS HAVE YO TO TRY ME WI YOUR DOUBTS
HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER HAD NOT ONLY DONE QUITE RIGHT IN THIS INSTANCE BUT HE DID NOT SEE FOR A MOMENT HOW THEY COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE
I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY SURE OF THE PURITY AND JUSTICE OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE MY JUDGES TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO A COURT-MARTIAL EVEN IF I COULD BRING A WHOLE ARRAY OF TRUTH-SPEAKING WITNESSES
IT MIGHT BE THAT HE VALUED THE POSITION HE HAD EARNED WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW SO MUCH THAT HE KEENLY FELT ITS BEING ENDANGERED BY THE IGNORANCE OR FOLLY OF OTHERS,--SO KEENLY THAT HE HAD NO THOUGHTS TO SPARE FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CONDUCT TO THEMSELVES
AND TH UNION CAN'T AFFORD US MUCH NOW I MUST GO
YOU FORGET WE HAVE ONLY TO DO WITH THEM FOR LESS THAN A THIRD OF THEIR LIVES
HE HAS LED A PRACTICAL LIFE FROM A VERY EARLY AGE
AS IT DROVE UP HE AND MARGARET STOOD CLOSE TOGETHER ON THE DOOR-STEP AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE DAY OF THE RIOT SHOULD FORCE ITSELF INTO BOTH THEIR MINDS
AND NOW HE SAYS THAT HE DOUBTED ALL ALONG AND HOPES THAT HIS MISTAKE WON'T HAVE OCCASIONED YOU SUCH ANNOYANCE AS TO LOSE THEIR SHOP YOUR CUSTOM
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE SHE COULD FIND SUCH ANOTHER
THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ALTHOUGH ON PLEASURE BENT HAD YET A BUSY MIND
YOU NEVER LIKED MILTON YOU KNOW SAID MRS THORNTON WITH A SORT OF GRIM SMILE
AND I WON'T PUT MYSELF IN THE WAY OF ANY MORE REFUSALS FROM MY SERVANTS SO I AM GOING MYSELF OH DEAR DEAR SAID FANNY CRYING AND PREPARING TO GO DOWN RATHER THAN BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE THOUGHT OF WOUNDS AND BLOODSHED IN THE VERY HOUSE
IT WAS AS MUCH AS MY LIFE WAS WORTH
SHE HAD PULLED HIS TALL HEAD DOWN AND STOOD UPON TIPTOE AND IMPLORED HIM NOT TO BE SHOCKED BEFORE SHE HAD VENTURED TO ASK THIS QUESTION
BUT SHE HAD NO THOUGHT OF PENITENCE BEFORE GOD
WHY THAT'S THE WORST OF IT
ALL HAD GONE WELL THROUGH THE HOUSE
YOU WILL GO WITH FREDERICK TO THE STATION MARGARET
WHY YO SEE THERE'S FIVE OR SIX MASTERS WHO HAVE SET THEMSELVES AGAIN PAYING THE WAGES THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THESE TWO YEARS PAST AND FLOURISHING UPON AND GETTING RICHER UPON
SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE GONE TO THE NEIGHBOURS
AND ON THE ROAD HOME SHE MET HER HUMBLE FRIENDS
NOT A BIRD'S NEST SURELY OH NO
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT IF I HAD WAITED UNTIL THE ACT WAS PASSED
SHE'S LIKE A BREATH OF COUNTRY AIR SOMEHOW
SURE WE CAN MASTER EYES OR CHEEK OR TONGUE NOR LET THE SMALLEST TELL-TALE SIGN APPEAR SHE EVER WAS AND IS AND WILL BE DEAR RHYMING PLAY
WHAT THEY SAID WAS ABOUT BUSINESS VERY PRESENT AND ACTUAL
NEIGHBOUR SAID SHE YOUR MAN IS DEAD
THE REALITY WAS ENOUGH FOR ME HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN HIS MOTHER STOPPED HIM WITH HER HAND UPON HIS ARM
YO MIGHT HA KNOCKED ME DOWN WI A STRAW WHEN THEY TELLED ME
IT WAS TOO HOT TO WALK VERY QUICKLY
SUDDENLY HE LOOKED UP AT HER WITH A WILD SEARCHING INQUIRY IN HIS GLANCE
HE STIRRED THE FIRE SNUFFED THE CANDLES AND SIGHED ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE HE COULD MAKE UP HIS MIND TO SAY--AND IT CAME OUT WITH A JERK AFTER ALL--'MARGARET
AND SHE ROUSED UP ALMOST LIKE A CHILD TO LOOK ABOUT HER AT THE DIFFERENT STREETS AND TO GAZE AFTER AND EXCLAIM AT THE SHOPS AND CARRIAGES
I'M AFRAID HONOUR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
HE HAD SLICKED HIS HAIR DOWN WITH THE FRESH WATER
I BELIEVE MARGARET I TORE IT WITH MY TEETH
REALLY HE EXCEEDS BROTHER-IN-LAW'S LIMITS
SEVENTY OF THAT HAS ALWAYS GONE TO FREDERICK SINCE HE HAS BEEN ABROAD
SHE'S BEEN SAYING ONCE OR TWICE SHE SHOULD LIKE TO GO FOR HER MOTHER HAS HAD A STROKE SINCE SHE CAME HERE ONLY SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO ASK
SHE THREW DOWN HER MUSIC AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING MARGARET STANDING CONFUSED AND BLUSHING TO EXPLAIN TO THE ASTONISHED GUESTS WHAT VISION HAD SHOWN ITSELF TO CAUSE EDITH'S SUDDEN FLIGHT
BUT SINCE THEN SHE HAD BEEN BUFFETED ABOUT AND FELT SO EXHAUSTED BY THIS RECENT STRUGGLE WITH HERSELF THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT EVEN STAGNATION WOULD BE A REST AND A REFRESHMENT
AND ALL TO BE SETTLED
I SHALL BE OUT ALL TO-MORROW
HE THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS SEAT TO TRY WITH CLOSED EYES TO UNDERSTAND HOW ONE IN LIFE YESTERDAY COULD BE DEAD TO-DAY
WHAT YOU ARE THINKING OF MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN
THE GREAT LONG MISTY SEA-LINE TOUCHING THE TENDER-COLOURED SKY
MR HALE LOOKED AT HER DISMAYED
MY EYES ARE NOT SO GOOD AS THEY WERE AND THE LIGHT HERE IS SO BAD THAT I CAN'T SEE TO MEND LACES EXCEPT JUST AT THE WINDOW WHERE THERE'S ALWAYS A SHOCKING DRAUGHT--ENOUGH TO GIVE ONE ONE'S DEATH OF COLD WELL I DARE SAY YOU WILL HAVE BOTH GOOD LIGHT AND PLENTY OF WARMTH AT NAPLES
BEFORE NIGHT YOU WILL HAVE TOLD YOUR MOTHER YES SHE REPLIED AND SHE RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM IN A STUNNED AND DIZZY STATE
AND BY THE TIME THAT SHE KNEW SHE MIGHT EXPECT HIGGINS SHE WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM QUIETLY AND AWAIT IN HER OWN CHAMBER THE EXPECTED SUMMONS
MARGARET WAS SURPRISED TO FIND AN ACCEPTANCE CONTEMPLATED AFTER ALL SHE HAD LEARNT OF SAD PROBABILITIES DURING THE DAY
ALTHOUGH THESE CONDITIONS WERE MADE AS LIGHT AS THEY WELL COULD BE THE AUTHOR FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOPE THE STORY IN THE MANNER ORIGINALLY INTENDED AND MORE ESPECIALLY WAS COMPELLED TO HURRY ON EVENTS WITH AN IMPROBABLE RAPIDITY TOWARDS THE CLOSE
SHE TOOK HER MIND AWAY WITH A WRENCH FROM THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST TO THE BRIGHT SERENE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HOPEFUL FUTURE
THERE IS BOUCHER
BUT AS HE ENDED HE SPRANG UP AND INTRODUCED MR THORNTON WHO HAD THAT MOMENT ENTERED TO EDITH AND CAPTAIN LENNOX
AND HE USED TO SIT PONDERING OVER THE REASON THAT COULD HAVE OCCASIONED THIS CHANGE
SHE FOUND HERSELF AT ONCE AN INMATE OF A LUXURIOUS HOUSE WHERE THE BARE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXISTENCE OF EVERY TROUBLE OR CARE SEEMED SCARCELY TO HAVE PENETRATED
MR HORSFALL THE STRANGER WHOSE VISIT TO THE TOWN WAS THE ORIGINAL GERM OF THE PARTY WAS ASKING QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THE TRADE AND MANUFACTURES OF THE PLACE
SHE--MRS THORNTON A MERE STRANGER--IT WAS TOO IMPERTINENT
MORE MEN WERE WANTED
MRS SHAW IS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME--ON ACCOUNT OF HER DAUGHTER SHE SAYS--AND WANTS MARGARET TO GO OFF WITH HER AT ONCE
FREDERICK
THE INSPECTOR RAN ALL THIS OVER IN HIS MIND--THE VAGUENESS OF THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT MARGARET HAD BEEN AT THE STATION--THE UNFLINCHING CALM DENIAL WHICH SHE GAVE TO SUCH A SUPPOSITION
SOMETIMES I HAVE SUCH FRIGHTFUL DREAMS ABOUT HIM OH MAMMA
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE BLOW HAS GIVEN HER SUCH AN ASCENDENCY OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD AS SHE'LL NEVER GET THE BETTER FROM
PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MRS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
AND NOW HE HAD COME IN THIS STRANGE WILD PASSIONATE WAY TO MAKE KNOWN HIS LOVE
ONLY THAT GENTLEMAN SAID HE WAS QUITE PICKING UP AFTER HIS TROUBLE ABOUT MRS HALE'S DEATH COME DOWN TO ME MRS PURKIS AFTER YOU HAVE ATTENDED TO MISS HALE
MR HALE WENT OUT TO HIS BOOKSELLER'S AND TO CALL ON A FRIEND OR TWO
YET SOMEHOW MARGARET LOOKED UPON THIS MAN WITH MORE INTEREST THAN UPON ANY ONE ELSE IN MILTON
MOTHER YOU DO NOT DARE HE FACED ABOUT AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE WITH HIS FLAMING EYES
AND SOME YOUNG MEN WHO HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES AND STRIVE TO REMEDY THEM
THE IDEA OF HELSTONE HAD BEEN SUGGESTED TO MR BELL'S WAKING MIND BY HIS CONVERSATION WITH MR LENNOX AND ALL NIGHT LONG IT RAN RIOT THROUGH HIS DREAMS
PAPA IS GOING TO LEAVE HELSTONE SHE BLURTED FORTH
SHE WAS GRATEFUL
AND THEN HALF WISHING TO READ IT ALONE AND UNWATCHED SHE MADE THE EXCUSE OF GOING TO TELL HER MOTHER AGAIN SARAH SURELY HAD MADE SOME MISTAKE THAT MR LENNOX WAS THERE
THE VAUNTED STEADINESS OF PULSE FAILED HIM FOR AN INSTANT
COACH-BUILDING IS A TRADE ALL THE SAME AND I THINK A MUCH MORE USELESS ONE THAN THAT OF BUTCHERS OR BAKERS
I NEVER KNEW WHY FOLK IN THE BIBLE CARED FOR SOFT RAIMENT AFORE
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO ASKED MRS HALE IN A SURPRISED INCREDULOUS VOICE
THEY TOOK ME FOR A FINE LADY I'M SURE EVEN I WAS MISTAKEN ENOUGH TO THINK YOU LOOKED LIKE A LADY MY DEAR SAID MR HALE QUIETLY SMILING
EVEN THE PASSERS-BY IN THE STREET HALF-TURNED THEIR HEADS TO GAZE AN INSTANT LONGER AT THE FIRM SEVERE DIGNIFIED WOMAN WHO NEVER GAVE WAY IN STREET-COURTESY OR PAUSED IN HER STRAIGHT-ONWARD COURSE TO THE CLEARLY-DEFINED END WHICH SHE PROPOSED TO HERSELF
IS THAT YOU HER SON OPENED THE DOOR AND SHOWED HIMSELF
BUT T'OTHER WOULD BE A GREATER CONVARSION IF IT WERE TRUE BUT THE MASTERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR RELIGION
I THOUGHT WELL LITTLE ONE WHAT DID YOU THINK ASKED FREDERICK AS SHE DID NOT FINISH HER SENTENCE
SO HE SHOULD
SOMEHOW THAT ROOM CONTRASTED ITSELF WITH THE ONE HE HAD LATELY LEFT
HALE LIKED YOU
I AM SORRY PAPA
I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE ANY OCCASION TO CONSIDER YOUR SPECIAL RELIGIOUS OPINIONS IN THE AFFAIR
YOU TWO MUST TRY AND MAKE EACH OTHER A LITTLE MORE LIBERAL-MINDED I DON'T WANT TO BE MORE LIBERAL-MINDED THANK YOU SAID MR BELL
NO ALLOWANCE FOR HUMAN PASSIONS GETTING THE BETTER OF REASON AS IN THE CASE OF BOUCHER AND THE RIOTERS
HE WERE NOT ONE TO BEAR HOW CAME HE INTO THE UNION ASKED MARGARET INNOCENTLY
UNTIL MARGARET HAD LEARNT THE TIMES OF THEIR INGRESS AND EGRESS SHE WAS VERY UNFORTUNATE IN CONSTANTLY FALLING IN WITH THEM
MAMMA IT'S SUCH A LONG WAY AND I AM SO TIRED WITH WHAT ASKED MRS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
I DO NOT TRY TO ESCAPE FROM ANYTHING SAID SHE
AND YET MANY A ONE WENT IN EVERY WEEK AT THE SAME WAGE TILL ALL WERE GONE IN THAT THERE WAS WORK FOR
THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH STRANGE UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN MY LIFE DURING THESE LAST TWO YEARS THAT I FEEL MORE THAN EVER THAT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO CALCULATE TOO CLOSELY WHAT I SHOULD DO IF ANY FUTURE EVENT TOOK PLACE
IT WOULD NEVER DO TO HAVE HER HERE WHEN HE COMES AND THEN SEND HER OFF IN A HURRY DIXON IS SURE TO REMIND US OF THAT
TOWARDS EVENING DIXON SAID TO HER
AND WHERE'S THE COMFORT TO COME FRO
I HAD BETTER NOT GO ON SAID HE IN A CONCERNED VOICE
YET THE OLD MAN HAS A RIGHT
THEY'LL BATTER THEM IN
BESIDES YOU COULD NEVER PAY TO GET MOTHER AND CHILDREN ALL THERE--THAT'S ONE GOOD THING I'VE RECKONED FOR THAT
HERE EVEN THE NECESSARY ACCOMMODATION OF TWO SITTING-ROOMS AND FOUR BED-ROOMS SEEMED UNATTAINABLE
BUT I CONFESS IT WAS AGAINST MY JUDGMENT THAT MY SON RENEWED HIS STUDY OF THEM
THEY TURNED THE CORNER OF THE WALK
I MEAN CAN YOU LEAVE IT AND COME INTO MY STUDY
SHE SATE UP AND OFFERED TO READ ALOUD
FOR I DOUBT THIS SMART CAPTAIN IS NO GREAT MAN OF BUSINESS
AND EACH ONE FORMED HER SPEECH SO AS TO BRING THEM ALL IN IN THE PRETTIEST ACCIDENTAL MANNER POSSIBLE YOU WILL BE AS PROUD OF YOUR ONE SERVANT WHEN YOU GET HER IF ALL IS TRUE ABOUT HER THAT MRS THORNTON SAYS TO BE SURE I SHALL
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL IF IT HAD NOT
SHE SAW BY HER MOTHER'S TWITCHING LIPS AND CHANGING COLOUR THAT SHE TOO WAS AWARE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD RETURNED
LET ME SHOW YOU TO A ROOM MISS MARGARET WHERE YOU CAN TAKE OFF YOUR BONNET AND WASH YOUR FACE
BUT I'M OBLIGED TO YOU MISS HALE
THAT VERY THING IS PRETTIEST GRACEFULEST BEST
HIS NAME IS WATSON
AND SHE WOULD HAVE DRAWN BACK FROM THE INTERVIEW HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE
MR THORNTON DID KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
SHE HAD BEEN AFRAID OF HIM BEFORE HE CAME EVEN WHILE SHE HAD LONGED FOR HIS COMING
THE INSPECTOR BOWED BUT DID NOT SPEAK
HIS ANGER HAD NOT ABATED
YOU SEE HE SAYS THAT THEY HAD MANY NEW HANDS ON BOARD THE RUSSELL WHILE THE AVENGER HAD BEEN NEARLY THREE YEARS ON THE STATION WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT TO KEEP SLAVERS OFF AND WORK HER MEN TILL THEY RAN UP AND DOWN THE RIGGING LIKE RATS OR MONKEYS MARGARET SLOWLY READ THE LETTER HALF ILLEGIBLE THROUGH THE FADING OF THE INK
IT'S IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND SHE'S ALWAYS SO GLAD TO SEE YOU
MEASTER
I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT I WAS SO BUSY LISTENING
DIRTY SMOKY PLACE AS I FEEL IT TO BE
BUT THIS TIME BEFORE I COMMIT MYSELF I WILL SEE MY GROUND CLEAR
DID HE GROUND IT UPON THE MISERABLE YESTERDAY
BUT WE GAVE THEM A CHANCE
THAT IS TO SAY HE READS WITH YOUNG MEN
MARGARET LAID HER HAND ON THE WOMAN'S ARM TO ARREST HER ATTENTION
THERE IS SOME SLIGHT EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE BLOW OR PUSH OR SCUFFLE THAT CAUSED THE FALL WAS PROVOKED BY THIS POOR FELLOW'S HALF-TIPSY IMPERTINENCE TO A YOUNG LADY WALKING WITH THE MAN WHO PUSHED THE DECEASED OVER THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM
THEY CAME UP THICK AND CHOKED AND HOARSE
SHE SUDDENLY FELT SHY WHEN THE LITTLE FEEBLE LIGHT MADE THEM VISIBLE
AND WITH GOOD ADVICE GETS BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BUT HAS DIXON SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HER NO
YET I THINK IT WAS CLEVER TOO
SHE'S NO COURAGE IN HER POOR THING MR THORNTON WAS NOT SPENDING THE MORNING SO SATISFACTORILY AS HIS MOTHER
SHE'S COME BACK TO ENGLAND ISN'T SHE YES SIR SHE'S COME BACK
YES I WILL
NO NOT YET
I SHALL BE BACK TO TEA AT SEVEN HE DID NOT LOOK AT EITHER OF THEM BUT MARGARET KNEW WHAT HE MEANT
WHY THERE WAS NOT A MAN--NOT A POOR DESPERATE MAN IN ALL THAT CROWD--FOR WHOM I HAD NOT MORE SYMPATHY--FOR WHOM I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT LITTLE I COULD MORE HEARTILY YOU MAY SPEAK ON MISS HALE
HE WAS IN THE ORION AT THE SAME TIME AS MASTER FREDERICK I KNOW
BUT IN TRUTH HE WAS AFRAID OF HIMSELF
SUCCESS BROUGHT WITH IT ITS WORLDLY CONSEQUENCE OF EXTREME ADMIRATION
BUT SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND TO HIM AND AGAIN HE FELT THE OMISSION AND SET IT DOWN TO PRIDE
HE LAY WITH HIS FACE DOWNWARDS
WHICH SHOWED SOME TERRIBLE SHAME IN THE BACKGROUND TO BE KEPT FROM THE LIGHT IN WHICH I THOUGHT SHE LIVED PERPETUALLY
YOU'D NOT SPEAK IN HASTE FOR HIS SAKE
I WISH YO A VERY GOOD NIGHT AND MANY THANKS TO YO YOU'LL FIND YOUR SHOE'S BY THE KITCHEN FIRE
MARGARET WAS THANKFUL THAT SHE RECEIVED THIS LETTER WHILE HER FATHER WAS ABSENT IN HER MOTHER'S ROOM
YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE PLEASURE OF BRINGING YOU SOME FRUIT AGAIN IF I SHOULD SEE ANY THAT IS TEMPTING
THE STRIKE HAD THROWN HIM TERRIBLY BEHINDHAND AS TO THE COMPLETION OF THESE ORDERS
THEY DON'T MAKE THEIR WAY MUCH UP HERE I THINK
AND THEN--OH MR BELL
THE DEEP IMPRESSION MADE BY THE INTERVIEW WAS LIKE THAT OF A HORROR IN A DREAM
THEN AS SHE BECAME MORE CALM SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN SO GREAT A HURRY
THERE'S ANOTHER FAMILY TO WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO GIVE--OH MAMMA MAMMA
ON A THOUSAND THINGS
THINK OF MAMMA HOW GLAD SHE WILL BE
HE ANSWERED
HE CAME CLOSE TO HER
THE ONLY ONE FOR IT WAS THE RELIEF TO HERSELF
WE MUST GO TO MILTON
AND SCARCELY LESS STERN DID HE LOOK WHEN HE RETURNED ALTHOUGH HIS ERRAND HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
YOU KNOW--YOU WOULD SEE THAT MONEY IS NOT VERY PLENTIFUL
MARGARET WAS ONCE MORE IN HER MORNING DRESS TRAVELLING QUIETLY HOME WITH HER FATHER WHO HAD COME UP TO ASSIST AT THE WEDDING
SHE WAS A GREAT DEAL BETTER
IT MADE HER RESTLESSLY IRRITATED TILL SHE COULD DO SOMETHING
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
SO THOUGH EVERY MOMENT ADDED TO HIS REPUGNANCE HIS PRIDE AND HIS SULLENNESS OF TEMPER HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE DEAD WALL HOUR AFTER HOUR FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER
HERE IT IS
THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT ARE THEY
BUT WHEN SHE GOT INTO HER OWN SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND SATE DOWN TO CRY UNWONTED TEARS
TELL HIM I AM PERFECTLY WELL BUT HER COMPLEXION WAS AS DEADLY WHITE AS HER HANDKERCHIEF
HE WAS AGAIN THE TUTOR IN THE COLLEGE WHERE HE NOW HELD THE RANK OF FELLOW
TO CATCH HIM IN THE STREET WAS HIS ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING THE MEASTER IF HE HAD RUNG THE LODGE BELL OR EVEN GONE UP TO THE HOUSE TO ASK FOR HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE OVERLOOKER
SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER
WAS IT NOT GOOD OF HIM YES SAID MARGARET QUIETLY
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTS IT ALL HE CONTINUED IN A HESITATING MANNER
ONLY DON'T BE STRONG-MINDED PLEADED EDITH
ARE YOU SURE YOU WILL NOT BE TIRED QUITE SURE
AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN WAS SO POSITIVE
FOR HE WAS AS IRON A CHAP AS ANY IN MILTON
SHE REMEMBERED HOW AT FIRST BEFORE SHE KNEW HIS CHARACTER SHE HAD SPOKEN AND THOUGHT OF HIM JUST AS FREDERICK WAS DOING
HIS MOTHER PREFERRED TO SIT IN IT
IT WAS SOME MONTHS SINCE HE HAD BEEN SO TALKATIVE AS HE WAS THIS DAY
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
IT IS NOT MUCH I THINK
NICHOLAS UNDERSTOOD ALL HER SIGNS FOR DIFFERENT ARTICLES WITH THE QUICKNESS OF LOVE AND EVEN THE ROUND-EYED SISTER MOVED WITH LABORIOUS GENTLENESS AT MARGARET'S HUSH PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID I'LL GO TO BED,--IT'S BEST PLACE
THEN REALLY I DON'T SEE ANY OCCASION FOR US TO GO ON WALKING TOGETHER
FATHER I'LL NOT LEAVE YO YO MAY STRIKE BUT I'LL NOT LEAVE YO SHE TOLD ME LAST OF ALL TO KEEP YO FRO DRINK BUT MARGARET STOOD IN THE DOORWAY SILENT YET COMMANDING
NOR DID HE SEEM MUCH INCLINED TO TALK TO HER
ONE LITTLE EVENT HAD COME OUT OF ANOTHER SO NATURALLY THAT MARGARET WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE TILL SHE SAW THE SLIGHT LOOK OF REPUGNANCE ON HER FATHER'S FACE
OPPOSITE TO THE WALL ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN ON ONE OF THE NARROW SIDES OF THE OBLONG WAS A HANDSOME STONE-COPED HOUSE,--BLACKENED TO BE SURE BY THE SMOKE BUT WITH PAINT WINDOWS AND STEPS KEPT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN
BUT IT IS NOT MILTON AIR
IT WAS NOW SO LONG AFTER THE TIME OF THESE OCCURRENCES THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE WAY OF EXPLAINING THEM SAVE THE ONE WHICH SHE HAD LOST BY MR BELL'S DEATH
NICHOLAS WE DO NOT WANT TO REASON
I WAS JUST MEANING TO GO THERE IF I HAD TIME BEFORE DINNER NO PAPA
IF WORK'S SURE AND STEADY THEER LABOUR'S PAID AT STARVATION PRICES
MY LAST GOOD NIGHT--THOU WILT NOT WAKE TILL I THY FATE SHALL OVERTAKE DR
YOU HAVE BEEN THINKING OF EVERYBODY AND NO ONE HAS THOUGHT OF YOU
MARGARET'S HEART ECHOED THE DREARINESS OF THE TONE IN WHICH THIS QUESTION WAS PUT
OH WHERE IS MY STRENGTH GONE TO
MRS SHAW WAS AS GOOD-TEMPERED AS COULD BE
AND ALL THIS WHILE MARGARET LAY AS STILL AND WHITE AS DEATH ON THE STUDY FLOOR
FOR WHEN MR BELL HAD FIRST GONE UP-STAIRS MRS SHAW LAY ASLEEP ON THE SOFA
AND HAS DOUBTLESS ADOPTED HIS WIFE'S COUNTRY AS HIS OWN THAT IS IT SAID MARGARET
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING SO DASTARDLY AS INCENDIARISM
THE SUNDAY POST INTERVENED AND INTERFERED WITH THEIR LONDON LETTERS
HER AUNT SHAW LOVED HER WELL IN HER OWN QUIET WAY
WOULD YOU MIND CALLING AT THE SCHOOL NOT A BIT
SHE PLACED HIM IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS
THE FERN-HARVEST WAS OVER AND NOW THAT THE RAIN WAS GONE MANY A DEEP GLADE WAS ACCESSIBLE INTO WHICH MARGARET HAD ONLY PEEPED IN JULY AND AUGUST WEATHER
I RECKON THEM'S ALMOST THE BEST WORDS THAT MEN CAN SAY
BUT MRS THORNTON REPLIED
I HAVE NOT TASTED SUCH FRUIT--NO
OH MR BELL
WHERE DOES HE LIVE IN SPAIN
I COULD ALMOST HAVE ENJOYED--IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES--THIS STOLEN VISIT
MARY HIGGINS THE SLATTERNLY YOUNGER SISTER HAD ENDEAVOURED AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO TIDY UP THE HOUSE FOR THE EXPECTED VISIT
IT WAS A TYPE A SIGN OF ALL THE COMING RELIEF WHICH HIS PRESENCE WOULD BRING
IT SHOWS THEY'RE NEITHER GIDDY NOR BOLD BY NATURE
THEY'LL WIN THE DAY SEE IF THEY DUNNOT NOT ONE WORD HAD MARGARET OR BESSY SPOKEN
RAW CRUDE MATERIALS CAME TOGETHER
DO IT GENTLY MAN BUT DO IT QUICK FOR WE CANNA LEAVE HIM HERE LONG I CANNA GO SAID HIGGINS
LET ME COME AND SEE YO IN IT
BUT FROM MY FORMER KNOWLEDGE OF MY PRESENT CAPTAIN I CONFESS I LOOK FORWARD WITH APPREHENSION TO A LONG COURSE OF TYRANNY ON BOARD THE RUSSELL YOU SEE HE PROMISES TO BEAR PATIENTLY AND I AM SURE HE DID FOR HE WAS THE SWEETEST-TEMPERED BOY WHEN HE WAS NOT VEXED THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
MR LENNOX LOOKED MORE AT HER THAN AT THE PEARS
IF SALVATION AND LIFE TO COME AND WHAT NOT WAS TRUE--NOT IN MEN'S WORDS BUT IN MEN'S HEARTS CORE--DUN YO NOT THINK THEY'D DIN US WI IT AS THEY DO WI POLITICAL CONOMY
BESSY SHUT HER EYES AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO BE SOOTHED
MARGARET'S FASCINATED EYES WATCHED ITS PROGRESS
BRAVELY AS FOR LIFE AND DEATH WITH A LOYAL GRAVITY
IN HIS GOOD TIME BROWNING'S PARACELSUS
BY AN EFFORT SHE LOOKED UP
MARGARET LIKED THIS SMILE
ANY REPAIRS WANTED NO NONE THANK YOU ARE YOU BUILDING ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN
MARGARET'S FORTITUDE NEARLY GAVE WAY AS DIXON WITH A SLIGHT MOTION OF HER HAND DIRECTED HER NOTICE TO NICHOLAS HIGGINS AND HIS DAUGHTER STANDING A LITTLE ALOOF BUT DEEPLY ATTENTIVE TO THE CEREMONIAL
MOTHER HE WENT ON SEEING THAT SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK I TOO HAVE BEEN REBELLIOUS
THESE HALF-EXPRESSIONS ARE WHAT RUIN A WOMAN'S CHARACTER HER CHARACTER
SHE TRIED TO TRANQUILLISE HIM BY READING ALOUD
WOULD YOU DISLIKE BREAKING IT TO HER VERY MUCH MARGARET MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
I'M THANKFUL IT IS AS IT IS
THEIR PRICES ARE VERY PERFECT TOO
HE IS A CLEARHEADED FELLOW
SO I WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING MY APPEARANCE IN THE PASSAGE WHEN AS I OPENED MY ROOM DOOR I SAW DIXON COMING DOWNSTAIRS
BUT SHE NEITHER LOOKED NOR SPOKE
YOU WON'T MUCH GRIEVE OVER OUR LEAVING THIS HOUSE SHALL YOU DEAR MOTHER NO
BUT WHEN DIXON FOLLOWING HIS DIRECTIONS TRIED TO FEED HER THE LANGUID SHAKE OF HEAD PROVED THAT IN SUCH A STATE AS MARGARET WAS IN FOOD WOULD ONLY CHOKE NOT NOURISH HER
DON'T YOU SEE I'M SMOKE-DRIED CERTAINLY
WOULD HE HA LET HIM OFF
AND AS FOR THE CONTINUAL MURMUR OF THE WORK-PEOPLE IT DISTURBS ME NO MORE THAN THE HUMMING OF A HIVE OF BEES
YOU KNOW WHO IS THE FATHER OF LIES MARGARET
BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS TO INQUIRE WHO SHE HERSELF WAS--SO QUIET SO STATELY AND SO BEAUTIFUL
I SHALL ARM MYSELF WITH A KNIFE SAID MR HALE
HE TOO MUST TAKE POOR FREDERICK FOR SOME LOVER SHE BLUSHED AS THE WORD PASSED THROUGH HER MIND I SEE IT NOW
BUT THEY DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ALL THOUGH THEY THINK THEY DO WHAT DO YOU MEAN JOHN CANDLES HAD BEEN BROUGHT AND FANNY HAD TAKEN UP HER INTERMINABLE PIECE OF WORSTED-WORK OVER WHICH SHE WAS YAWNING
AND WILL BE HERS WHETHER SHE WILL OR NO WHEN I DIE
I SEE
ONE KNOWS IT IS THE FASHION IN LONDON OR ELSE THE SINGERS WOULD NOT BRING IT DOWN HERE
IF IT WERE BUT ONE CHANCE IN A THOUSAND--OR A MILLION--I SHOULD DO IT DON'T FEAR SAID HIS MOTHER CRUSHING DOWN HER OWN PERSONAL MORTIFICATION AT THE LITTLE NOTICE HE HAD TAKEN OF THE RARE EBULLITION OF HER MATERNAL FEELINGS--OF THE PANG OF JEALOUSY THAT BETRAYED THE INTENSITY OF HER DISREGARDED LOVE
NOT MERELY THE COMMON AND UNIVERSAL SORROW ARISING FROM DEATH BUT ALL THE ANNOYANCE WHICH HER FATHER'S CONDUCT MUST HAVE CAUSED HER AND THEN HER FATHER'S CONDUCT SAID MR BELL IN AN ACCENT OF SURPRISE
SPEAK TO ME THE SPECULATION CAME AGAIN INTO HIS EYES AND HE MADE A GREAT EFFORT
MR THORNTON HAD LEARNT HER FALSEHOOD BEFORE HE WENT TO THE CORONER
BUT THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY PLENTY OF PEOPLE CAN IDENTIFY THEM BUT WON'T THEY COME BACK TO-NIGHT I'M GOING TO SEE ABOUT A SUFFICIENT GUARD FOR THE PREMISES
GOODBYE OU'D WENCH
GO AND CALL JANE,--SHE CAN FIND ME THE THINGS I WANT
SO DIXON CURIOSITY COMBINED WITH HER ALLEGIANCE TO URGE MARGARET TO GO TO REST WHICH HER APPEARANCE AS SHE LAY ON THE SOFA SHOWED BUT TOO CLEARLY THAT SHE REQUIRED
BAD WORDS IS SAYING AHA MY FINE CHAP
AND WANTED TO BORROW SOME MONEY FROM ME TO GO TO LONDON BY THE NEXT UP-TRAIN
IT MIGHT BE THAT REVENGE GAVE HIM NO PLEASURE
HE GUIDES ME AND THE BIRD
MRS THORNTON BATHED MARGARET'S TEMPLES WITH EAU DE COLOGNE
BUT WE WILL LESSEN IT AS MUCH AS EVER WE CAN
AND I COULD NOT STOP AT HOME SO I WENT TO MEET HIM
I DARE SAY I WAS WRONG
BUT WHAT POSSESSED ME TO DEFEND THAT MAN AS IF HE WERE A HELPLESS CHILD
SHE AT ANY RATE WAS FULFILLING HER DETERMINED PURPOSE
THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH USELESS LANGUAGES AS LATIN AND GREEK EVER INVENTED
I KNOW I HA GONE AND BOUGHT A FOUR-POUNDER OUT O ANOTHER BAKER'S SHOP TO COMMON ON SUCH DAYS JUST BECAUSE I SICKENED AT THE THOUGHT OF GOING ON FOR EVER WI THE SAME SIGHT IN MY EYES AND THE SAME SOUND IN MY EARS AND THE SAME TASTE I MY MOUTH AND THE SAME THOUGHT OR NO THOUGHT FOR THAT MATTER IN MY HEAD DAY AFTER DAY FOR EVER
BUT THE LENGTH OF A STREET--YES THE AIR OF A MILTON STREET--CHEERED HER YOUNG BLOOD BEFORE SHE REACHED HER FIRST TURNING
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH
WELL SAID SHE YO SEE THEY THINKEN A DEAL O MONEY HERE AND I RECKON YO'VE NOT GETTEN MUCH NO SAID MARGARET THAT'S VERY TRUE
AT THAT LATE HOUR SO FAR FROM HOME
BUT I REALLY DO NOT FIND MUCH PLEASURE IN GOING OVER MANUFACTORIES THEY ARE VERY CURIOUS PLACES SAID MRS HALE BUT THERE IS SO MUCH NOISE AND DIRT ALWAYS
AND SOME WENT BEGGARS ALL THEIR LIVES AT AFTER AY SAID HE
SHE TALKED INCESSANTLY AND FORCED HER NATURAL HUMOUR TO AN UNUSUAL PITCH
WON'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE HER HERE AGAIN
IT'S DIFFERENT FRO COMMON
AND YET WHEN IT FELL DOWN TO CALMNESS SHE FELT STRANGELY SADDENED AND SICK AT HEART AT EACH DISAPPOINTMENT
AND LOWERING HER HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS EVERY WEEK AS SHE FOUND THE DIFFICULTY OF MEETING WITH ANY ONE IN A MANUFACTURING TOWN WHO DID NOT PREFER THE BETTER WAGES AND GREATER INDEPENDENCE OF WORKING IN A MILL
AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO UTTER THE SPEECH SO EASY OF ARRANGEMENT WITH NO ONE TO ADDRESS IT TO
KING
DIXON CAN GET ME A CUP OF TEA HERE AND I WILL BE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM BY THE TIME YOU COME UP
YOU SHOULD HAVE WAITED TILL I CAME IN MARGARET I TRIED TO PERSUADE HER AND THEN SHE WAS SILENT
I DON'T CHOOSE HER OUT AS A SUBJECT FOR FRETTING
MASTER IS TERRIBLY BROKE DOWN
HE FELT AS THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE MIDST OF HER ROCKING IT AND RATING IT HAD SHE BEEN CALLED AWAY BEFORE HER SLOW CONFIDING SMILE IMPLYING PERFECT TRUST IN MOTHER'S LOVE HAD PROVED THE RENEWING OF ITS LOVE
OH NO SAID MARGARET
THE NERVOUSNESS HAD INCREASED SINCE MRS HALE'S DEATH PROBABLY BECAUSE HE DWELT UPON IT MORE EXCLUSIVELY
AS LONG AS HIS TIME HAD BEEN SOLELY OCCUPIED WITH HIS BOOKS AND HIS PARISHIONERS AS AT HELSTONE SHE HAD APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE WHETHER SHE SAW MUCH OF HIM OR NOT
BUT THERE WERE MORE REASONS AGAINST IT THAN FOR IT
THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HER HEART WAS ACHING ALL THE TIME WITH A HEAVY PRESSURE THAT NO SIGHS COULD LIFT OFF OR RELIEVE AND HOW CONSTANT EXERTION FOR HER PERCEPTIVE FACULTIES WAS THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP HERSELF FROM CRYING OUT WITH PAIN
IT WILL BE BUT LITTLE BESSY LAY BACK WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF WHAT MARGARET SAID
THEN TURNED BACK AS IF MOVED BY SOME PASSIONATE IMPULSE AND LOCKED THE DOOR INSIDE
I COULD HAVE CRIED TO THINK I COULDN'T SPITE HIM BETTER FOR HE KEPT SMILING IN MY FACE AS IF HE TOOK ALL MY COMPLIMENTS FOR EARNEST
BOUCHER'S BEEN IN THESE DAYS PAST A TELLING ME OF HIS FEARS AND HIS TROUBLES
SHE WAS HURT IN OUR HOUSE
HE IS A SUPERB LITTLE FELLOW ESPECIALLY IN HIS CAPS AND MOST ESPECIALLY IN THE ONE YOU SENT HIM YOU GOOD DAINTY-FINGERED PERSEVERING LITTLE LADY
I AM ON THE LOOK OUT FOR A SITUATION IN MILTON WHERE I MAY MEET WITH EMPLOYMENT UNDER SOME ONE WHO WILL BE WILLING TO LET ME GO ALONG MY OWN WAY IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE
SHE TRIED AGAIN
I IN LOVE--AND WITH HIM TOO HER PALE CHEEKS SUDDENLY BECAME ONE FLAME OF FIRE
MRS THORNTON HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF NATURAL HUMOUR TO MAKE HER FEEL THE LUDICROUSNESS OF THE POSITION IN WHICH SHE WAS LEFT
AFTER ALL WE MAY HAVE BEEN DOING WRONG
BUT THIS DELICIOUS VISION OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN--IN WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL MARGARET'S REPULSE HE WOULD HAVE INDULGED ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO--WAS MISERABLY DISTURBED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN NEAR THE OUTWOOD STATION
BUT THE VERY BRIGHTNESS OUTSIDE MADE THE COLOURS WITHIN SEEM POOR AND FADED
THOSE THAT HAVE LIVED THERE ALL THEIR LIVES ARE USED TO SOAKING IN THE STAGNANT WATERS
COME IN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
NEITHER LOSS OF FATHER NOR LOSS OF MOTHER DEAR AS SHE WAS TO MR THORNTON COULD HAVE POISONED THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE WEEKS THE DAYS THE HOURS WHEN A WALK OF TWO MILES EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS PLEASANT AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO HER TOOK HIM TO HER SWEET PRESENCE--EVERY STEP OF WHICH WAS RICH AS EACH RECURRING MOMENT THAT BORE HIM AWAY FROM HER MADE HIM RECALL SOME FRESH GRACE IN HER DEMEANOUR OR PLEASANT PUNGENCY IN HER CHARACTER
WHY ANY BUT YOU
WHILE ALL AROUND HER WERE ENJOYING THE MOTS OF MR GREY THE GENTLEMAN WHO ALWAYS TOOK THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE AT MRS SHAW'S DINNER PARTIES AND ASKED EDITH TO GIVE THEM SOME MUSIC IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE SHE'D BE SO BOLD AND FORWARD AS TO PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK POOR YOUNG LADY
TH MEASTER'S A DEAL TO POTTER HIM SAID HIGGINS ONE DAY AS HE HEARD MR THORNTON'S SHORT SHARP INQUIRY WHY SUCH A COMMAND HAD NOT BEEN OBEYED
AT HIS BEST TIMES AND IN HIS BEST MOODS HAD HE SPOKEN OF THEM
UPON MY WORD MOTHER I WISH THE OLD COMBINATION-LAWS WERE IN FORCE
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME SAID MR THORNTON FACING ROUND AT HIM AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE COUNTING-HOUSE OF THE MILL
WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE HOUSE-SERVANT ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY ON EVERY DARK MARK IN THE PATTERN OF THE OIL-CLOTH IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS DIRTY FOOT-PRINTS MARGARET RAN UPSTAIRS
THAT'S THE QUESTION I WANT WORK WORK
IT WAS EARLY SPRING AND SHE HAD GATHERED SOME OF THE HEDGE AND DITCH FLOWERS DOG-VIOLETS LESSER CELANDINES AND THE LIKE WITH AN UNSPOKEN LAMENT IN HER HEART FOR THE SWEET PROFUSION OF THE SOUTH
AND WENT TO TELL HER FATHER AND BROTHER THAT BREAKFAST WAS READY
THEN MR THORNTON SAID
THEY RESOLVED THAT MARTHA SHOULD LEAVE THEM THAT VERY AFTERNOON FOR THIS VISIT TO HER MOTHER
HE'S THE CHAP AS WROTE OFF AT ONCE FOR THESE IRISHERS
AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MRS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
AND IT IS SUCH A REST
I CANNOT STAY HERE
I AM ONLY TIRED MARGARET WENT UPSTAIRS
OTHERWAYS IT SEEMS ALL SENT FOR NOTHING NAY BESSY--THINK SAID MARGARET
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WAS NOT ATTENDING TO THE CONVERSATION BUT SOLELY BUSY WITH THE TEA-CUPS AMONG WHICH HER ROUND IVORY HANDS MOVED WITH PRETTY NOISELESS DAINTINESS
SHE CEASED
MAMMA WILL NOT SEE IT I THINK
SHE'S AWAKE NOW MARGARET
I COULD ALMOST WISH MARGARET HE STOPPED AND HESITATED
UNLESS INDEED I RUN THE CHANCES OF A COURT-MARTIAL OR UNLESS YOU AND MY FATHER WOULD COME TO SPAIN HE THREW OUT THIS LAST SUGGESTION AS A KIND OF FEELER
PAPA--YOU MUST NOT WONDER AT WHAT HE SAYS
MARGARET COULD NOT SIT STILL
NOW COMES THE BAD PART SAID SHE NERVOUSLY TWINING HER FINGERS TOGETHER
THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
SHE ONLY THOUGHT HOW SHE COULD SAVE HIM
I'VE MANY A THING I OFTEN WISHED TO SAY TO A PARSON AND I'M NOT PARTICULAR AS TO WHETHER HE'S PREACHING NOW OR NOT MARGARET WAS PERPLEXED
BUT WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER ANSWER HE WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD
A SOUL THAT DESIRES TO SERVE AND HONOUR HIM SHALL NEVER WANT OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT
THE KIND AND SENSIBLE NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD COME IN THE OTHER DAY SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING
HE TOOK HOLD OF IT AFFECTIONATELY
THERE WAS AN OMNIBUS PASSING--GOING INTO THE COUNTRY
I AM SO TIRED--SO TIRED OF BEING WHIRLED ON THROUGH ALL THESE PHASES OF MY LIFE IN WHICH NOTHING ABIDES BY ME NO CREATURE NO PLACE
EVEN IN HER MOURNING SHE WOULD REST WITH A PEACEFUL FAITH UPON HIS SYMPATHY
IT IS THE ONE SOLE COMFORT IN SUCH TIMES HE TURNED ROUND AND CAUGHT HER HAND
BUT HER SLUGGISH AND INCURIOUS NATURE WAS THE GREATEST SAFEGUARD OF ALL
THEY LOOK GLORIOUS FLAMES MARGARET IN YOUR BLACK HAIR YOU KNOW WE PLANNED YOU TO TALK ABOUT MILTON TO MR COLTHURST
AND AS HE LEANT OUT TO SAY GOD BLESS YOU MARGARET THE TRAIN RUSHED PAST HER
SHE TRIED TO REMEMBER IF SHE HAD SEEN HIM MOVE
I'M NONE SO SURE O THAT
LET ME ASK SHE ACCORDINGLY INQUIRED OF A PASSER-BY AND WAS INFORMED THAT MR THORNTON LIVED CLOSE TO THE MILL AND HAD THE FACTORY LODGE-DOOR POINTED OUT TO HER AT THE END OF THE LONG DEAD WALL THEY HAD NOTICED
NOTHING IS FIXED SAID HER FATHER WITH ANXIOUS HESITATION AS HE NOTICED THE FILMY SORROW THAT CAME OVER HER EYES AND THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COMPLEXION
THE MEANNESS OF HEART WHICH LEADS TO UNTRUTH
AND PERHAPS MAY CONTINUE TO BE
OH BUT I WILL SEND HER HOME IN A CAB
AND THERE WAS QUITE GERM OF TRUTH ENOUGH IN THIS IDEA TO MAKE IT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE TO REFUTE
FOR ALTHOUGH AT FIRST IT HAD STRUCK HER THAT HIS OFFER WAS FORCED AND GOADED OUT OF HIM BY SHARP COMPASSION FOR THE EXPOSURE SHE HAD MADE OF HERSELF,--WHICH HE LIKE OTHERS MIGHT MISUNDERSTAND--YET EVEN BEFORE HE LEFT THE ROOM,--AND CERTAINLY NOT FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE CLEAR CONVICTION DAWNED UPON HER SHINED BRIGHT UPON HER THAT HE DID LOVE HER
IN GENERAL THE CHILDREN AND SERVANTS ARE SO IN AND OUT THAT I CAN NEVER GET ANY BUSINESS SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED
MARGARET LOOKED BEAUTIFUL IN THE POMEGRANATE FLOWERS
SHE MIGHT BE IDLE AND SILENT AND FORGETFUL,--AND WHAT SEEMED WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER PRIVILEGES--SHE MIGHT BE UNHAPPY IF SHE LIKED
AND MEN JOSTLED EACH OTHER ASIDE IN THE MART AND IN THE EXCHANGE AS THEY DID IN LIFE IN THE DEEP SELFISHNESS OF COMPETITION
HE CAME TO STAY WITH ME
I BELIEVED ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR DEFENCE POOR FELLOWS BECAUSE IT JUST AGREED WITH FREDERICK'S STORY--BUT IT WAS OF NO USE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING THE CONVERSATION MRS HALE BEGAN TO CRY
I KNEW BETTER WHAT HIS LONDON MEANT
THERE WAS CHANGE EVERYWHERE
SO THEN TO SPITE ME--FOR YOU SEE WE WERE GETTING SAVAGE FOR ALL WE WERE SO CIVIL TO EACH OTHER--HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE AFTER MASTER FREDERICK AND SAID WHAT A SCRAPE HE'D GOT INTO AS IF MASTER FREDERICK'S SCRAPES WOULD EVER WASH GEORGE LEONARDS WHITE OR MAKE EM LOOK OTHERWISE THAN NASTY DIRTY BLACK AND HOW HE'D BE HUNG FOR MUTINY IF EVER HE WERE CAUGHT AND HOW A HUNDRED POUND REWARD HAD BEEN OFFERED FOR CATCHING HIM AND WHAT A DISGRACE HE HAD BEEN TO HIS FAMILY--ALL TO SPITE ME YOU SEE MY DEAR BECAUSE BEFORE NOW I'VE HELPED OLD MR LEONARDS TO GIVE GEORGE A GOOD RATING DOWN IN SOUTHAMPTON
THAT MRS THORNTON WAS THE MOTHER OF ONE WHOSE REGARD SHE VALUED AND FEARED TO HAVE LOST
ALL THE CHANGES CONSEQUENT UPON THIS GROUPED THEMSELVES AROUND THAT ONE GREAT BLIGHTING FACT
WHATTEN WAS I THINKING OF TO SIT STILL WHEN I SHOULD BE STIRRING MYSEL
SUCH A CHANGE FROM HELSTONE
HE WON'T TAKE THE HOUSE OFF OUR HANDS TILL NEXT JUNE TWELVEMONTH
MRS SHAW HUDDLED HERSELF UP IN HER SHAWL AND SHIVERED
ABOUT AS BROKEN DOWN BY THIS LAST STROKE AS SHE CAN BE I AM SURE IT IS VERY WELL FOR HER THAT SHE HAS SUCH A FRIEND AS YOU I WISH I WERE HER ONLY FRIEND MADAM
AND I COULD SEE WHAT FAIR PLAY WAS
HE GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME AT HER SAD AND PENSIVE FACE
MARGARET SAT AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT AT THE LAMPS AND THE STREET BUT SEEING NOTHING,--ONLY ALIVE TO HER FATHER'S HEAVY SIGHS
AND AFTER THIS RUSTIC LUNCHEON THEY SET OUT TO WALK HARDLY KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO TURN SO MANY OLD FAMILIAR INDUCEMENTS WERE THERE IN EACH
OTHER PEOPLE MUST GUARD HER
I KNOW THE DEEP INDENTATIONS ROUND THE LEAVES
AND MARGARET HAD TO FEED HIM LIKE A BABY RATHER THAN THAT HE SHOULD DISTURB HER MOTHER BY REMOVING A FINGER
SHE STRIKES ME AS PALE AND ILL I THOUGHT HER LOOKING REMARKABLY WELL
MARY TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT
BUT NO ONE CAN PLEASE ME BUT MYSELF OH
THERE NOW FILL UP YOUR DAY AT HELSTONE
AND THE MOST ISOLATED OF ALL YOUR DARKSHIRE EGOS HAS DEPENDANTS CLINGING TO HIM ON ALL SIDES
HE'LL GET ANGRY AND MAD--THEY ALL DO--AND THEN THEY GET TIRED OUT WI BEING ANGRY AND MAD AND MAYBE HA DONE THINGS IN THEIR PASSION THEY'D BE GLAD TO FORGET
HE WENT UP STRAIGHT WITH HIS BASKET TO MRS HALE AND SAID IN THAT SUBDUED AND GENTLE TONE WHICH IS SO TOUCHING WHEN USED BY A ROBUST MAN IN FULL HEALTH SPEAKING TO A FEEBLE INVALID I MET DR DONALDSON MA'AM AND AS HE SAID FRUIT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY--THE GREAT LIBERTY OF BRINGING YOU SOME THAT SEEMED TO ME FINE MRS HALE WAS EXCESSIVELY SURPRISED
I SUFFERED TOO MUCH MYSELF
CHAPTER XXIV MISTAKES CLEARED UP YOUR BEAUTY WAS THE FIRST THAT WON THE PLACE AND SCAL'D THE WALLS OF MY UNDAUNTED HEART WHICH CAPTIVE NOW PINES IN A CAITIVE CASE UNKINDLY MET WITH RIGOUR FOR DESERT YET NOT THE LESS YOUR SERVANT SHALL ABIDE IN SPITE OF RUDE REPULSE OR SILENT PRIDE WILLIAM FOWLER
I HAVE SAID HE
I OUGHT RATHER SAID SHE HASTILY TO APOLOGISE TO YOU FOR HAVING SAID THOUGHTLESS WORDS WHICH SENT YOU DOWN INTO THE DANGER IT WAS NOT YOUR WORDS
WE ARE CURIOUSLY BARE OF RELATIONS MARGARET COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM CRYING AT THE TENDER ANXIETY WITH WHICH FREDERICK WAS BRINGING BEFORE HER AN EVENT WHICH SHE HERSELF FELT WAS NOT VERY IMPROBABLE SO SEVERELY HAD THE CARES OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS TOLD UPON MR HALE
I WILL PUT MATTERS INTO THE HANDS OF MY MILTON ATTORNEY IF THERE IS NO WILL
AND AFTER FOURTEEN MONTHS OF RIOTOUS LIVING THE CITY AUTHORITIES HAD TO TAKE CHARGE OF HIM IN ORDER TO SAVE HIM FROM STARVATION
MR THORNTON HAD OBTAINED FOR HIM HIS FIRST SITUATION IN THE POLICE AND HAD HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME OF THE PROGRESS OF HIS PROTEGE BUT THEY HAD NOT OFTEN MET AND AT FIRST MR THORNTON DID NOT REMEMBER HIM
AND WHO WOULD I THINK TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR ANY OF--OF AUNT SHAW'S RELATIONS
THEIR NERVES ARE QUICKENED BY THE HASTE AND BUSTLE AND SPEED OF EVERYTHING AROUND THEM TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CONFINEMENT IN THESE PENT-UP HOUSES WHICH OF ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO INDUCE DEPRESSION AND WORRY OF SPIRITS
SO I TOLD HIM ALL THOUGH I BLUSHED TO SAY HOW A YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN SPEAKING TO ME
IF YOU REALLY THINK IT WILL DO YOUR MOTHER GOOD LET IT BE FIXED SO THIS WAS A GREAT STEP
SIMPLY HE HAS ANNOYED ME BY NOT JOINING IN MY PRAISES OF YOU
A STRANGER A CARELESS OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED THAT MRS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER CHILDREN BETOKENED FAR MORE LOVE TO FANNY THAN TO JOHN
I DON'T MEAN TO BLAME MR THORNTON
THANK GOD YOU ARE COME
MR LENNOX DREW NEAR TO MARGARET AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE
DO TELL ME HE LOOKED UP AT HER SUDDENLY AND THEN SAID WITH A SLOW AND ENFORCED CALMNESS
BUT HE COULD NOT HELP LOOKING AT HER AND HE SAW A SIGH TREMBLE OVER HER BODY AS IF SHE QUIVERED IN SOME UNWONTED CHILL
WHAT A PLEASURE FREDERICK'S VISIT WAS YES THAT IT WAS SAID MARGARET
LET US GO
HE SEEMED TO KNOW INSTINCTIVELY WHEN A LITTLE OF THE NATURAL BRILLIANCY OF HIS MANNER AND CONVERSATION WOULD NOT JAR ON THE DEEP DEPRESSION OF HIS FATHER OR MIGHT RELIEVE HIS MOTHER'S PAIN
MR THORNTON AND MR COLTHURST FOUND ONE OR TWO MUTUAL SUBJECTS OF INTEREST WHICH THEY COULD ONLY TOUCH UPON THEN RESERVING THEM FOR MORE PRIVATE AFTER-DINNER TALK
MARGARET LOOKED UP AT THE MAN ALMOST EXPECTING SOME CONTRADICTION FROM HIM OR AT LEAST SOME REMARK THAT WOULD MODIFY HIS DAUGHTER'S UTTER HOPELESSNESS
SHE MEANT THIS SPEECH FOR A LITTLE JOKE AND WAS VEXED ENOUGH WITH HER BUSY TONGUE WHEN SHE FOUND HER MOTHER TAKING IT SERIOUSLY
HOW IS MRS THORNTON ASKED MARGARET HURRIEDLY AND BELOW HER BREATH THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SPEAK OUT
BUT NO--IT'S YOU MISS HE WANTS MARGARET DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN TILL HER HAND WAS ON THE LOCK OF THE STUDY DOOR
HE HAS ALSO CONSULTED MR BELL--FREDERICK'S GODFATHER YOU KNOW MAMMA
IT SOOTHED AND COMFORTED HER SO TO OPEN HER HEART
I COULD MAPPEN HA LEARNT IF ANY ONE HAD TRIED TO TEACH ME WOULD IT NOT BE WORTH WHILE SAID MR HALE TO ASK YOUR OLD MASTER IF HE WOULD TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
I DARE NOT ASK YOU BOTH TO BREAKFAST THOUGH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE WELCOME
DESPISE HIM
THE SILENCE AROUND HER STRUCK HER AT LAST
SHE STOLE MY CAT DID SHE KNOW IT WAS YOURS I DON'T KNOW
THEY'D TELL US TO MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS AND THEY'D MIND THEIRS
OH I REMEMBER
I PROMISE SAID SHE WITH GRAVE SEVERITY
IT WAS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO APOLOGISE AND EXPLAIN
SO THAT WAS THE LADY YOU SPOKE OF AS A WOMAN SAID HE INDIGNANTLY TO HIGGINS
BUT OH MAMMA
IT MIGHT NOT GO WELL AT FIRST BUT AT EVERY HITCH INTEREST WOULD BE FELT BY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF MEN AND AT LAST ITS SUCCESS IN WORKING COME TO BE DESIRED BY ALL AS ALL HAD BORNE A PART IN THE FORMATION OF THE PLAN
HE CLEARLY SAW HIS OBJECT
I DON'T WANT IT TO FALL INTO A CHARITY
COME IN TO LUNCH NO THANK YOU I CAN'T
AND WHERE IT'S TO BE
LET ME GO WITH YOU SAID MARGARET IMPETUOUSLY
DIXON SAID SHE WAS QUITE AS BAD AS SHE HAD BEEN ON THE FIRST DAY SHE HEARD OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
BUT ABOVE ALL FULL OF CHARACTER AND STRONG HUMAN FEELING
AND I'D SHAVE THE WILD-BEAST SKINS AND MAKE THE WOOL INTO BROAD CLOTH
OH PAPA LET THEM GO UPSTAIRS VERY SOFTLY AND CAREFULLY AND PERHAPS SHE WILL NOT HEAR THEM
OH HOW HORRID
HE REALLY IS A MAN YOU WILL NOT DISLIKE--IF YOU WON'T BE SHOCKED TO BEGIN WITH BUT MARGARET TO BRING A DRUNKEN MAN HOME--AND YOUR MOTHER SO ILL MARGARET'S COUNTENANCE FELL
I'M SURE--HERE'S MY CAB
HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF SHE WOULD FINISH HER SENTENCE
HE WAS BUT LIKE MANY OTHERS--MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN--ALIVE TO DISTANT AND DEAD TO NEAR THINGS
WHY AS SHOLTO SAYS YOU'RE SUCH AN ATTRACTION TO THE HOUSE THAT HE KNOWS EVER SO MANY MEN WHO WILL BE GLAD TO VISIT HERE NEXT YEAR FOR YOUR SAKE MARGARET DREW HERSELF UP HAUGHTILY
HOW DO YOU THINK HER LOOKING
AND THE OLD TEA-CHESTS STUFFED AND COVERED FOR OTTOMANS
THE WARDROBE SHELF WITH HANDLES THAT SERVED AS A SUPPER-TRAY ON GRAND OCCASIONS
YOU ARE ANGRY AGAINST BOUCHER NICHOLAS
I LIKED THE GIRL FOR DOING IT SO FRANKLY FOR IT MADE ME SURE SHE HAD NO THOUGHT OF YOU
MRS SHAW TOOK AS VEHEMENT A DISLIKE AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ONE OF HER GENTLE NATURE TO DO AGAINST MILTON
AND HE WAS IF NECESSARY TO BE SPOKEN OF TO HER UNDER THE NAME OF MR DICKINSON
BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
I THINK I COULD DO ANYTHING BUT THAT
ONLY THEY DON'T COOK AS WELL AS THEY DID SO I THOUGHT IF YOU WERE GOING TO DINE I MIGHT TRY AND MAKE OUT MY DINNER
AND TO COME BACK TO THE BURDEN OF MY DITTY MY BABY ALWAYS SMILES
IT WAS THE FIRST THING SHE HAD ADMIRED IN THIS NEW FRIEND OF HER FATHER'S
AT ONE TIME SHE WAS SO BRAVE AND AT ANOTHER SO TIMID
BUT NO THANKS MARGARET TOOK UP A PEN AND SCRAWLED WITH TREMBLING HAND MARGARET HALE IS NOT THE GIRL TO SAY HIM NAY IN HER WEAK STATE SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY OTHER WORDS AND YET SHE WAS VEXED TO USE THESE
HERE'S MAMMA MRS THORNTON CAME IN WITH A LOOK OF BLACK STERNNESS ON HER FACE WHICH MADE MARGARET FEEL SHE HAD ARRIVED AT A BAD TIME TO TROUBLE HER WITH HER REQUEST
SHE DID NOT LIKE TO GO DOWN FOR LIGHTS LEST THE TACIT RESTRAINT OF HER PRESENCE BEING WITHDRAWN HE MIGHT GIVE WAY TO MORE VIOLENT EMOTION WITHOUT HER BEING AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM
I CANNA FACE HER THOU KNOWS HER BEST SAID THE MAN
HERE WAS HER PREUX CHEVALIER OF A BROTHER TURNED MERCHANT TRADER
MARGARET SHUT HERSELF UP IN HER OWN ROOM AFTER SHE HAD QUITTED MRS THORNTON
SHE HAS GOT ALL HER IDEAS OF DISSENTERS FROM THE QUAKERS HAS NOT SHE IF EVER YOU HEAR OR NOTICE THAT YOUR MOTHER WISHES FOR ANYTHING BE SURE YOU LET ME KNOW
AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN
HE HAD SEEN NOTHING BUT THE UNNECESSARY DANGER SHE HAD PLACED HERSELF IN
AT LENGTH SHE MURMURED IN A BROKEN VOICE
MARGARET ONLY WONDERED WHY PEOPLE WHO COULD AFFORD TO LIVE IN SO GOOD A HOUSE AND KEEP IT IN SUCH PERFECT ORDER DID NOT PREFER A MUCH SMALLER DWELLING IN THE COUNTRY OR EVEN SOME SUBURB
I SPOKE AS PLAIN AS I COULD BOUT USING WORDS WHEN I BOLTED TH DOOR
THE AUNT BROUGHT HER UP AND SHE AND THE COUSIN HAVE BEEN LIKE SISTERS
DOES HE NEVER COME TO ENGLAND NEVER HE WAS NOT OVER HERE ABOUT THE TIME OF MRS HALE'S DEATH NO
IN ALL THIS THERE WAS LITTLE THOUGHT ENOUGH OF THE FUTURE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AS AN INDIVIDUAL
AND THE GIRL IS TO HAVE THAT SLOPING ATTIC OVER YOUR ROOM AND MAMMA'S
SHE LIKED MUCH MORE TO DWELL UPON SPEECHES OF MR BELL'S WHICH HAD SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO HER OF WHAT WAS REALLY HIS INTENTION--MAKING MARGARET HIS HEIRESS
DIXON WOULD HAVE PUT THE CHAIN ON BEFORE SHE OPENED IT BUT MARGARET HAD NOT A THOUGHT OF FEAR IN HER PRE-OCCUPIED MIND
NICHOLAS WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE-SIDE IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER
I BEGAN TO WORK IN A CARDING-ROOM SOON AFTER AND THE FLUFF GOT INTO MY LUNGS AND POISONED ME FLUFF SAID MARGARET INQUIRINGLY
YOU SAW HIM BEFORE YOU KNOW ONLY HIS BACK
WELL MARGARET NOW TO LUNCHEON AS FAST WE CAN
BUT ONCE I THE UNION HIS INTERESTS ARE TAKEN CARE ON BETTER NOR HE COULD DO IT FOR HIMSEL OR BY HIMSEL FOR THAT MATTER
THAT HOO WILL
AT PRESENT BELIEVE ME YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME
MRS HALE SEEMED TO SHAKE OFF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER ATTACK AND LOOKED BRIGHTER AND BETTER THIS AFTERNOON THAN MARGARET HAD EVER HOPED TO SEE HER AGAIN
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE VICAR'S WIFE ALL EYES AND EARS
I THINK WE MUST BE NEIGHBOURS WE MEET SO OFTEN ON THIS ROAD WE PUT UP AT NINE FRANCES STREET SECOND TURN TO TH LEFT AT AFTER YO'VE PAST TH GOULDEN DRAGON AND YOUR NAME
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID HE HAS BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE HAS HE NOT ASKED FREDERICK THROWING THE QUESTION LIKE A BALL FOR ANY ONE TO CATCH WHO CHOSE
THE DISTANT SEA LAPPING THE SANDY SHORE WITH MEASURED SOUND
NOW I MUST RETURN TO OXFORD TO-MORROW AND I DON'T KNOW ON WHICH SIDE OF THE SCALE TO THROW IN MY VOICE HE PAUSED AS IF ASKING A QUESTION
IT'S YOU IS IT MA'AM SAID HE DRAWING A LONG BREATH AND WIDENING THE ENTRANCE BUT STILL NOT OPENING IT FULLY
AYE SAID MRS PURKIS SMOOTHING DOWN THE BED AND DESPATCHING JENNY FOR AN ARMFUL OF LAVENDER-SCENTED TOWELS TIMES IS CHANGED MISS
THE SEA HAS DONE MISS HALE AN IMMENSE DEAL OF GOOD I SHOULD FANCY SAID HE WHEN SHE FIRST LEFT THE ROOM AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN THEIR FAMILY CIRCLE
I BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT HEAR WHAT YOU SAID I WOULD RATHER NOT REPEAT IT SAID SHE
EDITH AND MRS SHAW HAD GONE TO DINNER
IT WAS BETTER TO BE STUNNED INTO NUMBNESS BY HEARING OF ALL THESE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH SEEMED TO BE NEARLY COMPLETED BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN TOLD
DON'T FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE YOU COULD GO TO LONDON TO-MORROW EVENING BY A NIGHT-TRAIN CONTINUED MARGARET WARMING UP INTO HER PLAN
THE BOOK-SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE
ONLY SOMETIMES HE IS VERY VERY BUSY
IT SEEMS STRANGE FOR THE BERESFORDS BELONG TO A GOOD FAMILY MARGARET MEANWHILE HAD FOUND HER MOTHER
YES I HAVE
WITH CAPTAIN AND MR LENNOX
OH JOHN
HE PINCHED HER CHEEK
I KNOW THE IMPRESSION HE MADE UPON ME WAS THAT MR THORNTON IS VERY BADLY OFF AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN AND THAT I'M TO BE VERY CIVIL TO HIM
THERE IS A CONTINUAL SMELL OF STEAM AND OILY MACHINERY--AND THE NOISE IS PERFECTLY DEAFENING I HAVE HEARD NOISE THAT WAS CALLED MUSIC FAR MORE DEAFENING
HE HAD BELONGED TO ONE OF THE SMALLER COLLEGES AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN SHY AND RESERVED
I SUPPOSE WE MUST HAVE MRS SHAW
NOT FOR YOU
MR LENNOX--HIS VISIT HIS PROPOSAL--THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHICH HAD BEEN SO RUDELY PUSHED ASIDE BY THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OF THE DAY--HAUNTED HER DREAMS THAT NIGHT
AT LEAST THAT KIND OF REST WHEN THE HANDS HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO AND ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE COMPLETE FOR AN EVENT WHICH MUST OCCUPY ONE'S HEAD AND HEART
MR THORNTON TURNED AWAY
MR THORNTON LEFT THE HOUSE WITHOUT COMING INTO THE DINING-ROOM AGAIN
IT WAS WELL THAT HER FATHER AND MR THORNTON WERE SO MUCH OCCUPIED BY THEIR CONVERSATION
MR HENRY LENNOX WAS THERE CUTTING OPEN THE PAGES OF A NEW REVIEW
IF I HAD ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR HOPE OF COURSE THAT IS AT AN END
NOT WITH ANY TINGE OF WHAT IS CALLED LOVE BUT WITH REGRET THAT SHE HAD WOUNDED HIM SO DEEPLY,--AND WITH A GENTLE PATIENT STRIVING TO RETURN TO THEIR FORMER POSITION OF ANTAGONISTIC FRIENDSHIP
I DON'T MEAN MERELY OVER THE WORKMEN
NOW PAPA I HAVE TOLD YOU THIS AND I CANNOT TELL YOU MORE
MRS THORNTON WAS A LITTLE MOLLIFIED
AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT TO WAIT
AND I'LL FIGHT ON TOO
CHAPTER XLI THE JOURNEY'S END I SEE MY WAY AS BIRDS THEIR TRACKLESS WAY I SHALL ARRIVE
AT HELSTONE UNPUNCTUALITY AT MEAL-TIMES WAS A GREAT FAULT IN HER MOTHER'S EYES
THIS GIRL DOWN-STAIRS WANTED ME TO ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER BUT SHE'S DEAD SAID MARGARET TURNING A LITTLE PALE
GO WHEN HIS CARES FOR THE LIVING MOTHER AND SORROW FOR THE DEAD SEEMED TO MAKE HIM ONE OF THOSE PECULIAR PEOPLE WHO ARE BOUND TO US BY A FELLOW-LOVE FOR THEM THAT ARE TAKEN AWAY
BUT I'D HAVE SHOWN THEM HOW I KEEP MY WORD AND HOW I MEAN THEM TO KEEP THEIRS
BUT NOW YOU SEE IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
IT IS WELL HE IS NOT ALIVE TO SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER HAS COME TO
HE IS NOT
HE USED TO GO AND SIT IN HIS OWN ROOM PERPETUALLY
YO'RE NOT KNOWING OF ANY PLACE WHERE THEY COULD GI ME A TRIAL AWAY FRO THE MILLS IF I'M SUCH A FIREBRAND
I SHALL NEVER NAME HIS HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND
THAT I NEVER READ IN ALL THE HISTORY I HAVE READ OF A MORE SLOW LINGERING TORTURE THAN THIS
WHILE SHE DID KNOW DID FEEL THE KEEN SHARP PRESSURE OF THE KNIFE THAT WAS SOON TO STAB HER THROUGH AND THROUGH BY LEAVING HER MOTHERLESS
I WAS IN MY BEDROOM
INSIDE THE ROOM EVERYTHING WAS IN CONFUSION
HE WAS THE ONE DEPUTED TO SEE AND ARRANGE WITH THE POLICE--TO LEAD IN ALL THE REQUISITE STEPS
HOW TIRED I USED TO BE OF THE DRIVES EVERY DAY IN AUNT SHAW'S CARRIAGE AND HOW I LONGED TO WALK AND WALK MARGARET DID IN SPITE OF THE WEATHER
YO'D M'APPEN THINK I WENT BEYOND MY PLACE IN SENDING MARY FOR YO BUT THE WRANGLIN AND THE LOUD VOICES HAD JUST TORN ME TO PIECES AND I THOUGHT WHEN FATHER LEFT OH
THEIR HEARTS WERE TOO FULL
COME HOME WITH ME SAID SHE AT LAST WITH A BOLD VENTURE HALF TREMBLING AT HER OWN PROPOSAL AS SHE MADE IT
I TOLD HIM I WAS SURE HELSTONE AIR DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM ANY MORE THAN WITH ME AND HE SUDDENLY LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND BEGGED ME NOT TO SPEAK A WORD MORE AGAINST HELSTONE HE COULD NOT BEAR IT
THEIR RECKLESS PASSION HAD CARRIED THEM TOO FAR TO STOP--AT LEAST HAD CARRIED SOME OF THEM TOO FAR
AND HE EVIDENTLY COULD NOT AGREE WITH ME
MARGARET NEEDED ALL DIXON'S HELP IN ACTION AND SILENCE IN WORDS
MRS SHAW HAD AS STRONG WISHES AS MOST PEOPLE BUT SHE NEVER LIKED TO DO ANYTHING FROM THE OPEN AND ACKNOWLEDGED MOTIVE OF HER OWN GOOD WILL AND PLEASURE
AND THERE'S HER AUNT MRS SHAW
HE HAS BEEN LIKE A FATHER TO ME
AND MARGARET IN A MINUTE OR TWO HAD APPARENTLY RECOVERED HER USUAL COMPOSURE
SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
AND NOW EVEN IF I DON'T WAKEN ALL AT ONCE I DREAM OF HIM IN SOME STORMY SEA WITH GREAT CLEAR GLASS-GREEN WALLS OF WAVES ON EITHER SIDE HIS SHIP BUT FAR HIGHER THAN HER VERY MASTS CURLING OVER HER WITH THAT CRUEL TERRIBLE WHITE FOAM LIKE SOME GIGANTIC CRESTED SERPENT
HAVING MANY INTERESTS DOES NOT SUIT THE LIFE OF A MILTON MANUFACTURER
THE ILLNESS SEEMS SO MUCH MORE ON THE MIND THAN ON THE BODY MR HALE LOOKED INFINITELY DISTRESSED
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING SHE STROVE TO MAKE HER WORDS DISTINCT
AND I SAY THAT THE MASTERS WOULD BE TRENCHING ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR HANDS IN A WAY THAT I FOR ONE SHOULD NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN DOING IF WE INTERFERED TOO MUCH WITH THE LIFE THEY LEAD OUT OF THE MILLS
GO AND SEE BESSY HIGGINS OF COURSE THOUGHT SHE AS THE RECOLLECTION OF THE MESSAGE SENT THE NIGHT BEFORE FLASHED INTO HER MIND
AND TO BOYS I FANCY ALL FRUIT IS GOOD
WELL SAID HE RATHER SHORTLY
THAT REGRET WAS THE PREDOMINANT FEELING ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF HER RECEIVING A PROPOSAL
HE WAS UNEASY AND CROSS UNABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN JEST AND EARNEST
BUT MARGARET WENT LESS ABROAD AMONG MACHINERY AND MEN
BUT IF IT SHOULD NOT BE TO-MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY OR EVEN A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT HENCE DON'T THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN YOU
OWING TO THE POSITION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN FOUND LYING HIS FACE WAS SWOLLEN AND DISCOLOURED BESIDES HIS SKIN WAS STAINED BY THE WATER IN THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR DYEING PURPOSES
STILL IT WAS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOME ONE NOW WITH WHOM SHE COULD TALK OF MILTON AND MILTON PEOPLE
AND IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SEVENTEEN HOURS SINCE SHE HAD TOLD A FALSEHOOD TO BAFFLE PURSUIT WHICH EVEN THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN VAIN
A MILTON LADY ASKED HE AS THE NAME WAS GIVEN
OR ELSE YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SEE THAT WHERE THE NATURAL PUNISHMENT WOULD BE SEVERE ENOUGH FOR THE OFFENCE ANY FARTHER PUNISHMENT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE REVENGE
I SEE MEN HERE GOING ABOUT IN THE STREETS WHO LOOK GROUND DOWN BY SOME PINCHING SORROW OR CARE--WHO ARE NOT ONLY SUFFERERS BUT HATERS
GET THE DOCTOR TO ORDER IT FOR HER
WELL IT WAS YOUNG LEONARDS OLD LEONARDS THE DRAPER'S SON AS GREAT A SCAMP AS EVER LIVED--WHO PLAGUED HIS FATHER ALMOST TO DEATH AND THEN RAN OFF TO SEA
THE POST GOES OUT AT FIVE--YOU WILL WRITE BY IT WON'T YOU
BUT TO BE SURE I MAY NOT SEE HIM
BUT ONCE ALLOW HER RIGHT TO LOVE AND BE BELOVED AND HAD HE ANY REASON TO DENY HER RIGHT?--HAD NOT HER WORDS BEEN SEVERELY EXPLICIT WHEN SHE CAST HIS LOVE AWAY FROM HER SHE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN BEGUILED INTO A LONGER WALK ON TO A LATER HOUR THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
I HAVE TAKEN HIGGINS ON I AM GLAD OF IT SAID SHE COLDLY
YOU DO LOOK WRETCHEDLY WHITE TO BE SURE
MARCH BROUGHT THE NEWS OF FREDERICK'S MARRIAGE
THERE WAS A MOMENTARY HUSH OF THEIR NOISE INARTICULATE AS THAT OF A TROOP OF ANIMALS
ONLY HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING--OR NOT DOING--BETTER THAN HE KNEW THE MOVEMENTS OF ANY ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM
MR BELL THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS TIRED AND SENT HER EARLY TO HER ROOM WHERE SHE SATE LONG HOURS BY THE OPEN WINDOW GAZING OUT ON THE PURPLE DOME ABOVE WHERE THE STARS AROSE AND TWINKLED AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE GREAT UMBRAGEOUS TREES BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED
BUT IT WAS NOT TILL PROVISIONS GREW SO HIGH THIS WINTER THAT I BETHOUGHT ME HOW BY BUYING THINGS WHOLESALE AND COOKING A GOOD QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS TOGETHER MUCH MONEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND MUCH COMFORT GAINED
MARGARET AND HER FATHER WERE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
COMING UP TO TOWN
HOW TENDER HE WAS WITH DEAR MAMMA
THE MEN WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO TELL THEM HOW TO GO ON
EDITH WAS IMPATIENT TO GET WELL IN ORDER TO FILL MARGARET'S BED-ROOM WITH ALL THE SOFT COMFORTS AND PRETTY NICK-KNACKS WITH WHICH HER OWN ABOUNDED
HE HAS TAKEN THE NAME OF DICKENSON
THERE THAT'S ENOUGH SAID HER BROTHER RISING FROM THE TABLE
THERE WERE NO SMOCK-FROCKS EVEN AMONG THE COUNTRY FOLK
DON'T MAMMA
THEY BOTH WERE REMINDED OF THEIR RECENT LOSS BY A STRANGE KIND OF SHYNESS IN THEIR NEW HABILIMENTS AND IN THE FACT THAT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY WEEKS THAT THEY HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT TOGETHER
FAINT ALTERNATIONS OF WHISPERED SOUND AND STUDIOUS SILENCE
THE SETTING SUN FELL ON THEIR FACES
NO GILDING
HE CROSSED TO THE PORTER'S LODGE
MARGARET WAS SEIZED WITH A SHY AWKWARD DREAD OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH HIM
WE'N DONE A DEAL IN BRINGING HIM HERE--THOU TAKE THY SHARE I CANNA DO IT SAID HIGGINS
BUT SHE STILL WAS SO DESIROUS OF HIS SHAKING OFF THE LIABILITY ALTOGETHER AS TO MAKE HER VERY URGENT THAT HE SHOULD ACCEPT MR BELL'S INVITATION TO VISIT HIM AT OXFORD THIS APRIL
SHE HAD NO FEAR OF THEM
THE ATTITUDE WAS EXQUISITELY EASY
LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
AND THEN THE WHOLE THING IS SO PAINFUL TO ME
ONE DAY MARGARET AND HER FATHER HAD BEEN AS FAR AS THE FIELDS THAT LAY AROUND THE TOWN
AT THE MOMENT IT HAD SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD OCCASION SO LITTLE DELAY--ADD SO LITTLE TO THE APPARENTLY SMALL CHANCES OF DETECTION
I CAN GIVE THEM A FORTNIGHT,--NO MORE
HE CAME UP STRAIGHT TO HER FATHER WHOSE HANDS HE TOOK AND WRUNG WITHOUT A WORD--HOLDING THEM IN HIS FOR A MINUTE OR TWO DURING WHICH TIME HIS FACE HIS EYES HIS LOOK TOLD OF MORE SYMPATHY THAN COULD BE PUT INTO WORDS
THE WINDOW PLACED AT THE SIDE OF THE OBLONG LOOKED TO THE BLANK WALL OF A SIMILAR PROJECTION NOT ABOVE TEN FEET DISTANT
AND SHE LIKED TO THINK OF SEEING MARGARET DRESSED FOR A PARTY AND DISCUSSED WHAT SHE SHOULD WEAR WITH AN UNSETTLED ANXIETY THAT AMUSED MARGARET WHO HAD BEEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO SOCIETY IN HER ONE IN HARLEY STREET THAN HER MOTHER IN FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF HELSTONE
HE WILL GRIEVE AT NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEND HIS FATHER'S FUNERAL
BUT I'LL RETRACT ALL I SAID AS FAST AS I CAN
I SHALL ONLY BE TOO GLAD TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THAT MAY SEEM ANOMALOUS OR MYSTERIOUS TO A STRANGER
SHE COULD BE CONTENT TO BE AT VENICE OR NAPLES OR SOME OF THOSE POPISH PLACES AT THE LAST INTERESTING TIME WHICH TOOK PLACE IN CORFU I THINK
SHE SAW UNUSUAL LOITERERS IN THE STREETS
THE REST BE HANGED FOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE IN THE WORLD FOR
THE BROTHER AND SISTER ARRANGED THE TABLE TOGETHER SAYING LITTLE BUT THEIR HANDS TOUCHING AND THEIR EYES SPEAKING THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF EXPRESSION SO INTELLIGIBLE TO THOSE OF THE SAME BLOOD
HE FELT HIS POWER AND REVELLED IN IT
I WAS AFRAID HE WAS NOT WELL FROM HIS HURRIED NOTE YESTERDAY MY SON IS RARELY ILL
AND I COULDN'T SEE THAT HE MINDED WHAT I SAID IN THE LEAST WHILE I WAS MAD WITH ALL HIS SPEECHES BUT YOU DID NOT TELL HIM ANYTHING ABOUT US--ABOUT FREDERICK NOT I SAID DIXON
HIS NOBLER SELF HAD SAID AT FIRST THAT ALL THIS LAST MIGHT BE ACCIDENTAL INNOCENT JUSTIFIABLE
HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THE CONFUSION STIRRING IN HER COUNTENANCE
WHAT MADE YOU THINK HE WAS I SAW A YOUNG MAN WALKING WITH MISS HALE ONE DAY REPLIED MR THORNTON AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THAT TIME OH THAT WOULD BE THIS YOUNG LENNOX THE CAPTAIN'S BROTHER
I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL MARGARET COULD HARDLY SMILE AT THIS LITTLE JOKE SO OPPRESSED WAS SHE BY HER VISIT TO THE HIGGINSES
A STRAW-HAT FORCED DOWN UPON A ROSE-TREE AS ON A PEG TO THE DESTRUCTION OF A LONG BEAUTIFUL TENDER BRANCH LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH IN FORMER DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAINED UP TENDERLY AS IF BELOVED
AND WHO'S TO COME TO IT
HE HAD A PLATEFUL OF SOMETHING BROUGHT UP TO HIM
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
BUT WHILE SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW THINKING HOW TO BEGIN AND WAITING FOR THE SERVANT TO HAVE LEFT THE ROOM HER MOTHER HAD GONE UP-STAIRS TO PUT ON HER THINGS TO GO TO THE SCHOOL
YO MAY BE KIND HEARTS EACH SEPARATE
OH MOTHER
SO DON'T LET ME HEAR OF THESE FOOLISH MORBID IDEAS
FOOD IS HIGH,--AND THEY MUN HAVE FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDER I RECKON
HE HAD TO SEE HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES
SHE CREPT AWAY AND HID FROM HIS IDEA
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO STRIKE FOR FOR THE MASTERSHIP AND OWNERSHIP OF OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY SAID MRS THORNTON WITH A FIERCE SNORT
AND THOUGH HIS SORROW FOR THE LOSS OF HIS MOTHER WAS A DEEP REAL FEELING AND WOULD LAST OUT HIS LIFE IT WAS NEVER TO BE SPOKEN OF AGAIN
OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET
SHE COULD ONLY SEE
MY NAME IS HIGGINS I KNOW THAT BROKE IN MR THORNTON
I DIDN'T SAY VERY ILL SAID HER BROTHER RATHER SHARPLY
HE KEPT SAYING I QUITE EXPECTED TO HAVE SEEN MR THORNTON
I ONLY WANTED YOU EXACTLY TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE GOING TO-MORROW I SHALL ORDER HORSES NONSENSE JOHN
PASSING OUT OF HER RECOLLECTION IN THEIR RAPID DEVELOPMENT AS SHE BY HER THREE YEARS ABSENCE WAS VANISHING FROM THEIRS
MARGARET ALMOST REPENTED THE URGENCY WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTREATED HIM TO GO TO LONDON
YES THERE WAS ONE DISTINCT SLOW TRAMP OF FEET WHICH MADE ITSELF A CLEAR PATH THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHED THEIR EARS
IT'S NO USE TELLING HIM FOOLS WILL ALWAYS BREAK OUT O BOUNDS
MY MOTHER MANAGED SO THAT I PUT BY THREE OUT OF THESE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS REGULARLY
MARGARET AND DIXON HAD BEEN AT WORK FOR TWO DAYS UNPACKING AND ARRANGING BUT EVERYTHING INSIDE THE HOUSE STILL LOOKED IN DISORDER
FIRE'S WELLY OUT SAID HE GIVING IT A VIGOROUS POKE AS IF TO TURN ATTENTION AWAY FROM HIMSELF
I AM GOING TO-MORROW
FANCY A MAN DICTATING IN THIS MANNER THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD SELL AND WHEN HE WOULD NOT SELL
KEEP UP YOUR COURAGE FOR FIVE MINUTES MISS HALE DON'T BE AFRAID FOR ME SHE SAID HASTILY
HER WHOLE LIFE JUST NOW WAS A STRAIN UPON HER FORTITUDE
BUT SHE DID NOT SPEAK
FROM EVERY NARROW LANE OPENING OUT ON MARLBOROUGH STREET CAME UP A LOW DISTANT ROAR AS OF MYRIADS OF FIERCE INDIGNANT VOICES
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
I RECKON THEY'D HAVE EITHER TO GIVE UP THEIR FARMS OR TO GIVE FAIR RATE OF WAGE SUPPOSE THEY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT DO THE LAST
IN MR THORNTON'S CASE AS FAR AS MARGARET KNEW THERE WAS NO INTERVENING STAGE OF FRIENDSHIP
LOOK HERE
LANDOR
LANDOR
IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT MARGARET WAS KNOWN TO MR THORNTON TO HAVE SPOKEN FALSELY,--THOUGH SHE IMAGINED THAT FOR THIS REASON ONLY WAS SHE SO TURNED IN HIS OPINION,--BUT THAT THIS FALSEHOOD OF HERS BORE A DISTINCT REFERENCE IN HIS MIND TO SOME OTHER LOVER
OTHERWISE THERE WAS NO MOTION PERCEPTIBLE TO HIS EXPERIENCED OBSERVATION
THANK YOU NEWTON I CAN TAKE THEM DOWN--YOU'RE BUSY SO MARGARET WENT DOWN LADEN WITH SHAWLS AND SNUFFING UP THEIR SPICY EASTERN SMELL
I DARE SAY I WAS EVEN CONSIDERED A PRETTY FAIR CLASSIC IN THOSE DAYS THOUGH MY LATIN AND GREEK HAVE SLIPT AWAY FROM ME SINCE
THERE'S MY GOOD GIRL
SARVANT SIR SAID HE SLICKING HIS HAIR DOWN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM
WHAT IS THE MATTER AND THEN AS THE IDEA STOLE INTO HER MIND OF WHAT WAS INDEED THE REAL STATE OF THE CASE SHE ADDED AS IF A LITTLE DISPLEASED
SHE DOUBTED THE REALITY OF MRS HALE'S ILLNESS
AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT ONCE AGAIN THOUGH I'M LONE AND FORLORN FOR EVERMORE HE STOOPED DOWN AND FONDLY KISSED HIS DAUGHTER
MARGARET LED HIM TO THE STUDY DOOR BUT HER SPIRITS WERE SO AGITATED THAT SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE THE MEETING
A MAN HAS DIED AT THE INFIRMARY IN CONSEQUENCE OF A FALL RECEIVED AT OUTWOOD STATION BETWEEN THE HOURS OF FIVE AND SIX ON THURSDAY EVENING THE TWENTY-SIXTH INSTANT
THE ADVANTAGES WERE MUTUAL
THE SLOW TEARS GATHERED INTO MARGARET'S EYES BUT A DEEP CALM ENTERED INTO HER SOUL
I NEVER SAW SUCH A LITTLE AWKWARD GOOD-FOR-NOTHING PAIR OF HANDS
AND WHEN I'VE LISTENED AT THE DOOR I'VE HEARD HIM TALKING TO HER AND TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE WAS ALIVE
BUT THIS MR REID AS HE WAS THEN SEEMED TO TAKE A DISLIKE TO FREDERICK FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
MY MOTHER AND SISTER WILL NEED THAT PROTECTION OH
HE IS A FELLOW OF PLYMOUTH COLLEGE THERE
PRAY TELL ME DIXON AT ONCE THAT YOUNG WOMAN YOU GO TO SEE--HIGGINS I MEAN WELL WELL
HE HAS LEFT THE ROOM
HERE THERE WAS NO SOUND
I SEE ONE THERE WHO IS
HER FATHER HAD JUST ENTERED THE ROOM AND SHE WAS MOST ANXIOUS THAT THE FAINT IMPRESSION SHE HAD SEEN ON HIS MIND THAT THE MILTON AIR HAD INJURED HER MOTHER'S HEALTH SHOULD NOT BE DEEPENED,--SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY CONFIRMATION
ONE EVENING MR HALE BEING ABSENT HER MOTHER BEGAN TO TALK TO HER ABOUT HER BROTHER FREDERICK THE VERY SUBJECT ON WHICH MARGARET HAD LONGED TO ASK QUESTIONS AND ALMOST THE ONLY ONE ON WHICH HER TIMIDITY OVERCAME HER NATURAL OPENNESS
POOR COWARDS THAT WE ARE
BESIDES EVERYBODY HAS LEFT BUT OUR DEAR STUPID SELVES WHO CAN'T SETTLE WHERE TO GO TO
SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD FEEL THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE
THEIR VOYAGE ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN--THEIR MUSIC AND DANCING ON BOARD SHIP
OF COURSE SHE WAS VERY WELL A GREAT STOUT SLATTERNLY THING
BUT TO INTERFERE WITH HER CONDUCT--TO SPEAK OF HER CHARACTER
AND THEN HE TURNED HIS BACK TO THE YOUNG LADIES AND THREW HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT BUT WITH ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO A CONVERSATION WITH MR HALE
FOR SEVERAL MILES BEFORE THEY REACHED MILTON THEY SAW A DEEP LEAD-COLOURED CLOUD HANGING OVER THE HORIZON IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT LAY
WHAT COULD HE MEAN
NAY ONCE OR TWICE SHE WAS ASKED QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO SOME ARTICLE WHICH THEY PARTICULARLY ADMIRED
THOU WILT HAVE LITTLE THANKS O MY SOUL
FROM HENCEFORTH DIXON OBEYED AND ADMIRED MARGARET
BUT HAD ANY ONE ASKED HER WHEN SHE HAD ENDED THE MEANING OF WHAT SHE HAD BEEN READING SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
THESE TWO LAST CRYING BETWEEN WHILES WONDERED HOW THE YOUNG LADY COULD KEEP UP SO THIS LAST DAY AND SETTLED IT BETWEEN THEM THAT SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO CARE MUCH FOR HELSTONE HAVING BEEN SO LONG IN LONDON
HOO'S CALLED BESSY HIGGINS
IT WAS BUT AN UNSATISFACTORY VISIT TO MRS BOUCHER
YET HOW CAN I HELP IT SHE LOOKED SO TRULY GRIEVED AS SHE SAID THIS THAT HE STRUGGLED FOR A MOMENT WITH HIS REAL DISAPPOINTMENT AND THEN ANSWERED MORE CHEERFULLY BUT STILL WITH A LITTLE HARDNESS IN HIS TONE
AND INSTANTLY THE STORM BROKE
I AM PERHAPS ENCROACHING UPON THE NEXT DUES BUT THE WINTER IS LIKELY TO BE SEVERE AND OUR POOR OLD PEOPLE MUST BE HELPED OH MAMMA LET US DO ALL WE CAN SAID MARGARET EAGERLY NOT SEEING THE PRUDENTIAL SIDE OF THE QUESTION ONLY GRASPING AT THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE RENDERING SUCH HELP FOR THE LAST TIME
IT IS NOTHING SHE SAID WITH A SICKLY SMILE
HER HEART LEAPED UP IN APPREHENSION AT EVERY RING OF THE DOOR-BELL
HE WAS AWARE FROM THE FIRST GLANCE HE HAD GIVEN ROUND THE ROOM THAT MARGARET WAS THERE
AT THE END SHE ROSE UP AND SAID TO HERSELF IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
HIS GOODNESS VERGING ON WEAKNESS AS ALL THE SOFTER VIRTUES DID IN HER MIND AND HER OWN CONTEMPT FOR MR AND MRS HALE AND POSITIVE DISLIKE TO MARGARET WERE THE IDEAS WHICH OCCUPIED MRS THORNTON TILL SHE WAS STRUCK INTO NOTHINGNESS BEFORE THE DARK SHADOW OF THE WINGS OF THE ANGEL OF DEATH
YES SAID MARGARET
SHE HAD TAKEN OFF HER SHAWL AND HUNG IT OVER THE BACK OF HER CHAIR
I SHOULD BE SO GLAD IF YOU WOULD I'M AFRAID IT WOULD BE OF NO USE SAID MR HALE IN A LOW VOICE
THERE WAS A SMALL GARDEN ON THE PLACE WHERE THE BEECH-TREE HAD BEEN
I DARE SAY IF HE HAD TOLD ME HIS DOUBTS AT THE FIRST I COULD HAVE NIPPED THEM IN THE BUD MISTAKEN AS MARGARET FELT HER FATHER'S CONDUCT TO HAVE BEEN SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR IT BLAMED BY HER MOTHER
I HAVE KEPT IT FOR YOU
THERE WAS NO NEAR SOUND,--NO STEAM-ENGINE AT WORK WITH BEAT AND PANT,--NO CLICK OF MACHINERY OR MINGLING AND CLASHING OF MANY SHARP VOICES
THEY PUT HER MOTHER TO BED AND MARGARET SATE BY HER TILL SHE FELL ASLEEP AND AFTERWARDS TILL DIXON BECKONED HER OUT OF THE ROOM AND WITH A SOUR FACE AS IF DOING SOMETHING AGAINST THE GRAIN SHE BADE HER DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE WHICH SHE HAD PREPARED FOR HER IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND STOOD OVER HER IN A COMMANDING ATTITUDE AS SHE DID SO
I'M A HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND THE WORLD
INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET PAYMENT FOR THE ORDERS COMPLETED
AND I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK IT WERE ALL A SET O CHANCES THAT MIGHT HA BEEN ALTERED WI A BREATH O WIND
STRONG-MINDED AND ALL THAT CANT
SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION JUST THEN
HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH-BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME
IT'S THE ONLY WAY WORKING MEN CAN GET THEIR RIGHTS BY ALL JOINING TOGETHER
HE WAS SO MISERABLY UNEASY THAT AT LAST SHE CONSENTED TO GO INTO HER OWN ROOM AND PREPARE FOR GOING TO BED
OF COURSE IT DOES
I HALF EXPECTED MR THORNTON WOULD HAVE CALLED
SHE WONDERED IF SHE SHOULD HAVE MINDED DETECTION HALF SO MUCH FROM ANY ONE ELSE
I WON'T DENY THAT I AM PROUD OF BELONGING TO A TOWN--OR PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY A DISTRICT--THE NECESSITIES OF WHICH GIVE BIRTH TO SUCH GRANDEUR OF CONCEPTION
DIXON STOUTLY AND BLUNTLY REFUSED TO GO TO BED
SO THAT WHEN SHE COMES ROUND SHE SHOULD ONLY FIND ONE OR TWO THAT SHE KNOWS ABOUT HER
AND PLEASE I WOULD RATHER GO ON THINKING OF YOU SO
YOU KNOW HELSTONE I HAVE SEEN IT
BUT IN HER ANXIETY NOT TO BRING BACK HER FATHER'S FEARS TOO VIVIDLY SHE GAVE BUT A BUNGLING ACCOUNT AND LEFT THE IMPRESSION ON MRS THORNTON'S MIND THAT MRS HALE'S WAS SOME TEMPORARY OR FANCIFUL FINE-LADYISH INDISPOSITION WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT ASIDE HAD THERE BEEN A STRONG ENOUGH MOTIVE
THEN I'LL NEVER SMOKE NO MORE I TH HOUSE HE REPLIED TENDERLY
HE HAD SPOKEN OF IT AT HELSTONE AS OF A JOURNEY WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE IN A VERY SHORT TIME FROM THEN
ABOUT MARGARET WELL
MR BELL KNEW SOMETHING OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSING THROUGH HER MIND AND WISELY AND KINDLY HELD HIS TONGUE
WE'VE PARTED COMPANY AT LAST WE HAVE
THORNTON'S AS DOUR AS A DOOR-NAIL
SOME WANT RESOLUTELY TO LEARN THOUGH THEY HAVE COME TO MAN'S ESTATE
AND I WERE SORE-HEARTED TOO WHICH IS WORSE THAN SORE-FOOTED
HE STARTLED MARGARET ONE EVENING AS SHE SATE AT HER WORK BY SUDDENLY ASKING
OR IN THE TRIUMPH OF THE CROWDED PROCESSION HAVE THE HELPLESS BEEN TRAMPLED ON INSTEAD OF BEING GENTLY LIFTED ASIDE OUT OF THE ROADWAY OF THE CONQUEROR WHOM THEY HAVE NO POWER TO ACCOMPANY ON HIS MARCH
I DARESAY THERE'S TRUTH IN YON LATIN BOOK ON YOUR SHELVES
OH DEAR MARGARET
I WANT TO FORGET SO THE ARRANGEMENTS WENT ON
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU AS FAR FROM IT AS MOST PEOPLE
A LETTER TO FREDERICK
BUT MR LENNOX ALMOST EXCEEDED MARGARET IN HIS APPRECIATION OF THE CHARACTER OF MILTON AND ITS INHABITANTS
BUT NO DEEP PLAN NO CAREFUL CUNNING COULD HAVE STOOD HIM IN SUCH GOOD STEAD
BUT HERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE ABOUT
HER SLOW DEEP BREATHINGS DILATED HER THIN AND BEAUTIFUL NOSTRILS
AND THE NEXT MINUTE SHE VEXED ME SO BY SEEMING TO THINK WELL NEVER MIND
I AM SO SORRY MR LENNOX IS NOT HERE,--HE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN I CAN
HE WAS NOT THERE
NOT BUT THAT EDITH WAS VERY THOROUGHLY AND PROPERLY IN LOVE
SHE WISHED THAT THE MAN WOULD GO
BUT THIS SEEMS SUCH A MOCKERY OF MOURNING THAT I DID NOT EXPECT IT FROM HIM SHE STARTLED HER FATHER BY BURSTING INTO TEARS
AND IT IS OWING TO HIM WE ARE GOING TO MILTON HOW SAID MARGARET
I DID NA THINK HE'D GOT IT IN HIM TO LIE STILL AND LET TH WATER CREEP O'ER HIM TILL HE DIED
HE'S DEAD AND I'M SORRY
SHE IS DEAD SHE SAID
SHE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT AND SIMPLE AND TRUE TO SAVE WHERE SHE COULD SAVE
THE FAINT PINK REFLECTION OF EARTHLY LIGHTS ON THE SOFT CLOUDS THAT FLOAT TRANQUILLY INTO THE WHITE MOONLIGHT OUT OF THE WARM GLOOM WHICH LIES MOTIONLESS AROUND THE HORIZON
SO PERHAPS MY OPINION IS NOT WORTH HAVING
AND MARGARET GLAD THAT HER PART OF ENTERTAINING THE VISITOR WAS OVER WENT TO THE WINDOW TO TRY AND MAKE HERSELF MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE STRANGE ASPECT OF THE STREET
HE LOOKS VERY INFLEXIBLE
THAT HOPE FOR THE REVIVAL OF TRADE MUST UTTERLY BE GIVEN UP
GOVERNMENT TAKES CARE O FOOLS AND MADMEN
MARGARET LONGED TO SEND FOR CHARLOTTE
HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY
SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT MRS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS
IT MAY BE LIKE WAR
HOW SHE HAD BEEN ALARMED--AND THEN THOUGHT THEY WERE GONE--AND THEN FELT SICK AND FAINT AND TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB
AND HERE WILL I STAY OUT MY APPOINTED TIME OH FREDERICK SAID MARGARET TELL US MORE ABOUT HER
IT GAVE HER TIME TO COMPREHEND THE SUDDEN CHANGE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN HER CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS
I AM CURIOUS TO SEE SOMETHING OF THE TEACHING SHE IS TO RECEIVE THEY DID NOT SPEAK MUCH MORE BUT THRIDDED THEIR WAY THROUGH MANY A BOSKY DELL WHOSE SOFT GREEN INFLUENCE COULD NOT CHARM AWAY THE SHOCK AND THE PAIN IN MARGARET'S HEART CAUSED BY THE RECITAL OF SUCH CRUELTY
I'LL WRITE AND TELL HER SHE MUST
SHE HEARD HIM EVEN WHILE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS FINISHING A SENTENCE
T
T
MRS THORNTON HERSELF WENT
BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINCT
SHE WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD EVEN BECOME SLEEPILY DEADENED INTO FORGETFULNESS OF ANYTHING BEYOND THE LIFE WHICH WAS LAPPING HER ROUND WITH LUXURY
I CANNOT PART WITH THEE
INTO HIS IT CAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPEECHES OF THE FOLLOWING DAY
IN FACT I FEAR THE SECRET WILL BE KNOWN SOON ENOUGH WITHOUT MY REVEALING IT HE PAUSED
WHEN TRADE IS BAD THERE'S MORE UNDERMINING OF HEALTH AND PREPARATION FOR DEATH GOING ON AMONG YOU MILTON MEN THAN YOU'RE AWARE OF NOT WITH ME DOCTOR
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HIM IF HE HAD ASKED
I CAN'T CONCEIVE HOW HE CONTRIVED TO MISMANAGE HIS AFFAIRS WITH HIS POWERS AND OPPORTUNITIES YOU WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED SAID MARGARET
THEY PROCEEDED TO THE HOUSE TO FIND MRS HALE AND WISH HER GOOD-BYE
AND HOO'L NOT GO DOUBTING THAT I'M MAIN SORRY FOR TH OUD GENTLEMAN'S DEATH JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T GET AT HER AND TELL HER SO AND SAYS HE YO'LL NOT HAVE MUCH TIME FOR TO TRY AND SEE HER MY FINE CHAP
EDITH HAD RATHER OBJECTED TO THIS ARRANGEMENT FOR CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE BY A LATE TRAIN THIS VERY EVENING
IN A MOMENT SHE SIGHED OUT FREDERICK AND STRETCHED OUT BOTH HER HANDS TO CATCH HIS AND DRAW HIM IN
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT SHE ONLY REDDENED AND TURNED AWAY
HE APPEARS A WORTHY KIND OF MAN ENOUGH
MR HALE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS PUPIL'S LUKEWARMNESS ABOUT GREEK LITERATURE WHICH HAD BUT A SHORT TIME AGO SO GREAT AN INTEREST FOR HIM
IF YOU'RE QUITE CONVINCED THAT ANY FOOLISH PASSION ON MY PART IS ENTIRELY OVER I WILL WISH YOU GOOD AFTERNOON HE WALKED OFF VERY HASTILY
I COULD ALMOST FANCY SHE THINKS HERSELF TOO GOOD FOR HER COMPANY AT TIMES
BUT A SUDDEN REMEMBRANCE SUGGESTED BY SOMETHING IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ROOM,--OF A LITTLE DAUGHTER--DEAD IN INFANCY--LONG YEARS AGO--THAT LIKE A SUDDEN SUNBEAM MELTED THE ICY CRUST BEHIND WHICH THERE WAS A REAL TENDER WOMAN
I AM SURE SAID MARGARET I AM SURE YOU DID NOT KNOW
DEAR OLD DIXON
SHE DID NOT YET KNOW HOW COOLLY SUCH THINGS WERE TAKEN BY THE MASTERS AS HAVING ONLY ONE POSSIBLE END
AND HE TELLS ME THAT HE HEARS THERE IS A GOOD OPENING FOR A PRIVATE TUTOR THERE A PRIVATE TUTOR SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL
AND MARGARET IF I AM TO DIE--IF I AM ONE OF THOSE APPOINTED TO DIE BEFORE MANY WEEKS ARE OVER--I MUST SEE MY CHILD FIRST
LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
IT WAS A HAPPY BROODING ALTHOUGH TINGED WITH REGRET AT BEING SEPARATED FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME FROM HER GENTLE AUNT AND DEAR COUSIN
SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE SO EXCLUSIVELY ADDRESSED
THREE TIMES WAS IT NOT YES MAMMA YOU SEEM TO HAVE A STRONG OBJECTION TO ACTS OF PARLIAMENT AND ALL LEGISLATION AFFECTING YOUR MODE OF MANAGEMENT DOWN HERE AT MILTON SAID MR HALE
I BEG YOUR PARDON HIGGINS DID NOT TURN ROUND OR IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO THIS
THEN AS A NEW THOUGHT CAME ACROSS HER SHE PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER
AND WE'RE RESOLVED TO STAND AND FALL TOGETHER
AND MAY I SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW THE NORTH ASKED HE WITH AN INEXPRESSIBLE GENTLENESS IN HIS TONE AS HE SAW THAT HE HAD REALLY HURT HER
I LIKE TO HEAR THEM THOUGH I DARE SAY I SPOKE AS IF I WAS ANNOYED
THEY RETARDED MOTION AND WERE APT TO CATCH ON MACHINERY AND SO THE HABIT OF WEARING THEM HAD DIED OUT
SHE WILL BE ABLE TO SUGGEST SOMETHING PERHAPS--WON'T YOU FAN I HAVE NOT ALWAYS AN AILMENT SAID FANNY PETTISHLY
ONLY IT OUGHT TO WARN ME AND CHECK ME FROM GIVING WAY TO SUCH PASSIONATE WISHES
IT WAS ONE OF HER BETTER DAYS AND SHE WAS FULL OF PRAISES OF THE WATER-BED
AND I'LL HIDE UP COSMO'S RED COAT AND SWORD AND MAKE THE BAND PLAY ALL SORTS OF GRAVE SOLEMN THINGS
BUT IT HAD BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT IF POSSIBLE ON THE SUCCEEDING EVENING--IF NOT THEN AT LEAST THE VERY FIRST EVENING THAT MR THORNTON COULD COMMAND,--THEY SHOULD MEET FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION
HER SPIRITS WERE DAMPED AT ANY RATE AND SHE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GO ON TALKING AT ALL MUCH MORE IN THE WILD WAY THAT SHE HAD DONE
I LIKE HER SAID HIGGINS SUDDENLY
SO IN THE NATURAL SWEET DESIRE TO AVOID GIVING UNNECESSARY PAIN SHE FORCED HERSELF TO GO FORWARDS WITH A LITTLE GREETING AND CONTINUE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING ADDRESSING HERSELF TO HIM EXPRESSLY
BUT NEVER A WORD OF THE VICAR'S BEING AILING IT IS SO HOWEVER SAID MR BELL
HADN'T YOU BETTER GO INTO THE BACK ROOMS
MR BELL TURNED AWAY AND SMILED
THOU SAIDST NICHOLAS ON WEDNESDAY SENNIGHT--AND IT'S NOW TUESDAY I TH SECOND WEEK--THAT AFORE A FORTNIGHT WE'D HA THE MASTERS COMING A-BEGGING TO US TO TAKE BACK OUR WORK AT OUR OWN WAGE--AND TIME'S NEARLY UP,--AND THERE'S OUR LILE JACK LYING A-BED TOO WEAK TO CRY BUT JUST EVERY NOW AND THEN SOBBING UP HIS HEART FOR WANT O FOOD,--OUR LILE JACK I TELL THEE LAD
FOR HE SITS AND LISTENS AND STARES AS IF I WERE SOME STRANGE BEAST NEWLY CAUGHT IN SOME OF THE ZONES
I REMEMBER YOUR NAMING HIM IN YOUR LETTERS
OH PAPA PERHAPS I HAVE DONE WRONG
I NOW BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONLY YOUR INNATE SENSE OF OPPRESSION--(YES
HER WHOLE CONDUCT IS CLEAR TO ME NOW
BUT NEITHER HE NOR SHE WERE PEOPLE TO BROOK THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF THEIR PROCEEDINGS
THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS
I CAN DO THIS
SHE HAD HERS VERY EARLY WHEN I WAS TOO BUSY TO GO TO HER AND I AM SURE SHE WILL BE GLAD OF ANOTHER NOW RAILROAD TIME INEXORABLY WRENCHED THEM AWAY FROM LOVELY BELOVED HELSTONE THE NEXT MORNING
OH HOW STRANGE IT WILL BE
THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE
BUT THERE ARE THOSE LENNOXES WHO ARE THEY ASKED MR THORNTON WITH TREMBLING INTEREST
MR HALE'S SUCCESSOR IN THE LIVING WAS APPOINTED
I WILL DO THEM THAT JUSTICE
AND SHE HAD HAD TO BEAR UP AGAINST SUCH HARD PRESSURE THAT SHE FELT QUITE OLD
AND TO SAY THAT I AM SURE YOU MEANT KINDLY--HOWEVER MUCH WE MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER MRS SHAW LOOKED EXTREMELY PERPLEXED BY WHAT MARGARET HAD SAID
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE GIVEN YOU WORK BUT HE WOULD NOT HAVE USED SUCH LANGUAGE AS TO TH LANGUAGE I'M WELLY USED TO IT
HER QUICKENED SENSE COULD INTERPRET EVERY SOUND OF MOTION
IT WAS A RELIEF TO ALL THREE WHEN MR LENNOX SAID THAT HE MUST GO DIRECTLY IF HE MEANT TO CATCH THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN
AS SHE STOOD ON THE DOOR-STEP AT HER RETURN HER FATHER CAME UP
IT IS AWFUL TO SEE THEM THE SOLDIERS WILL BE HERE DIRECTLY AND THAT WILL BRING THEM TO REASON TO REASON SAID MARGARET QUICKLY
CAN YOU DO NOTHING TO SOOTHE THESE POOR CREATURES
NOW SINCE THAT DAY WHEN MR LENNOX CAME AND STARTLED HER INTO A DECISION EVERY DAY BROUGHT SOME QUESTION MOMENTOUS TO HER AND TO THOSE WHOM SHE LOVED TO BE SETTLED
WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF ME THAT SHOULD LEAD YOU TO SUSPECT--OH SAID SHE BREAKING DOWN AND COVERING HER FACE WITH HER HANDS--'I KNOW NOW MR THORNTON HAS TOLD YOU NO MISS HALE SAID MRS THORNTON HER TRUTHFULNESS CAUSING HER TO ARREST THE CONFESSION MARGARET WAS ON THE POINT OF MAKING THOUGH HER CURIOSITY WAS ITCHING TO HEAR IT
AND THEN SATE DOWN AGAIN IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CHAIR TO FALL INTO ONE OF HIS SAD WAKING DREAMS
BUT THEN I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT IT
BUT DIXON'S IDEAS OF HELPFUL GIRLS WERE FOUNDED ON THE RECOLLECTION OF TIDY ELDER SCHOLARS AT HELSTONE SCHOOL WHO WERE ONLY TOO PROUD TO BE ALLOWED TO COME TO THE PARSONAGE ON A BUSY DAY AND TREATED MRS DIXON WITH ALL THE RESPECT AND A GOOD DEAL MORE OF FRIGHT WHICH THEY PAID TO MR AND MRS HALE
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN WELL IN THIS AIR YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T THINK THE SMOKY AIR OF A MANUFACTURING TOWN ALL CHIMNEYS AND DIRT LIKE MILTON-NORTHERN WOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS AIR WHICH IS PURE AND SWEET IF IT IS TOO SOFT AND RELAXING
BUT SURELY YOU ARE NOT A COWARD ARE YOU
SHE TRIED TO RISE WITHOUT HIS HELP
YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME
IS YON THING UPSTAIRS REALLY HIM
I'M NOT GOING FOR TO TELL MORE
WHY DID HE PAUSE
PERHAPS CROMER WAS IN ONE SENSE OF THE EXPRESSION THE BEST FOR HER
THEY WENT THROUGH THE WELL-KNOWN STREETS PAST HOUSES WHICH THEY HAD OFTEN VISITED PAST SHOPS IN WHICH SHE HAD LOUNGED IMPATIENT BY HER AUNT'S SIDE WHILE THAT LADY WAS MAKING SOME IMPORTANT AND INTERMINABLE DECISION-NAY ABSOLUTELY PAST ACQUAINTANCES IN THE STREETS
BUT AN OLD MAN GETS RACKED WITH RHEUMATISM AND BENT AND WITHERED BEFORE HIS TIME
THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND
BUT HIS FACE WAS INTELLIGENT KEEN AND MOBILE
MISS HALE I HAD A ROUND-ROBIN FROM SOME OF MY MEN--I SUSPECT IN HIGGINS HANDWRITING--STATING THEIR WISH TO WORK FOR ME IF EVER I WAS IN A POSITION TO EMPLOY MEN AGAIN ON MY OWN BEHALF
THAT HER LOVER'S DEATH HAS SO AFFECTED HER SPIRITS SHE CAN'T GIVE HER HEART TO HER WORK VERY WELL
SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS BUT PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THE ART OF MAKING THE SAME KIND OF BEDS AS THEY USED TO DO IN HER YOUTH
THE EVENING WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT PASSED IN A ROOM HIGH UP IN AN HOTEL WAS LONG AND HEAVY
MEN WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS SAUNTERING ALONG
AND THAT WHAT WITH HOME AND FOREIGN COMPETITION WE ARE NONE OF US LIKELY TO MAKE ABOVE A FAIR SHARE AND MAY BE THANKFUL ENOUGH IF WE CAN GET THAT IN AN AVERAGE NUMBER OF YEARS CAN'T YOU GET HANDS FROM IRELAND
YOU MAY COME AND WELCOME
MANY A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND THOUGHT IT STRANGE TO SEE HIM OCCUPIED JUST LIKE A PORTER OR AN ERRAND-BOY
SHE TOOK A SAVAGE PLEASURE IN THE IDEA OF SPEAKING HER MIND TO HER IN THE GUISE OF FULFILMENT OF A DUTY
HE WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF TALKING TO LADIES
DIXON WAS PACKING UP A FEW TOILETTE ARTICLES AND MARGARET WAS HASTILY PUTTING ON HER BONNET SHEDDING TEARS ALL THE TIME AND HER HANDS TREMBLING SO THAT SHE COULD HARDLY TIE THE STRINGS
COULD HE STAND
IF NEIGHBOURS DOESN'T SEE AFTER NEIGHBOURS I DUNNO WHO WILL BESSY SEEMED ALMOST AFRAID LEST MARGARET SHOULD THINK THEY HAD NOT THE WILL AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE POWER OF HELPING ONE WHOM SHE EVIDENTLY REGARDED AS HAVING A CLAIM UPON THEM
IF YOU PLEASE MISS MARGARET HERE'S THE WATER-BED FROM MRS THORNTON'S
IS THERE ANYTHING SO WONDERFUL IN OUR BEING ASKED OUT TO DINNER BY A MAN WHO OWNS HIMSELF INFERIOR TO MY FATHER BY COMING TO HIM TO BE INSTRUCTED
HE LOOKED ROUND AS SHE CAME IN SMILED AND QUIETLY GAVE HER HIS CHAIR AND THEN SAT DOWN AFRESH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND WITH A LITTLE BOW OF APOLOGY TO HIS GUEST FOR THE INTERRUPTION
STAY INTERRUPTING HIMSELF RATHER ABRUPTLY WAS IT AT YOUR MOTHER'S FUNERAL HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY
SHE HAD HEARD HIM OFTEN BOAST OF HIS POWER OF PUTTING ANY DISAGREEABLE THOUGHT FAR AWAY FROM HIM
SHE HAD SPOILED THE REMEMBRANCE OF FREDERICK'S VISIT TO HERSELF BY HER OWN COWARDICE
BUT IT WAS NOT SO
AND THE LETTERS ANNOUNCING THE MARRIAGE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A SPLENDID BLACK LACE MANTILLA CHOSEN BY DOLORES HERSELF FOR HER UNSEEN SISTER-IN-LAW WHOM FREDERICK HAD REPRESENTED AS A PARAGON OF BEAUTY WISDOM AND VIRTUE
MARGARET HEARD ENOUGH OF THIS UNREASONABLENESS TO DISHEARTEN HER
HE SAW THE LATENT SWEEP OF HER MIND WHICH COULD EASILY HE THOUGHT BE LED TO EMBRACE ALL THE OBJECTS ON WHICH HE HAD SET HIS HEART
MR HALE'S OVER-PRAISE HAD THE USUAL EFFECT OF OVER-PRAISE UPON HIS AUDITORS
BARBAULD
YES TO BE SURE I RECOLLECT WE TALKED ABOUT HIM POOR FELLOW YES--AND DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT MR LENNOX SPOKE ABOUT HIS HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND ABOUT THE TIME OF DEAR MAMMA'S DEATH ASKED MARGARET HER VOICE NOW LOWER THAN USUAL
I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE REPRESENTATIVE OF OXFORD WITH ITS BEAUTY AND ITS LEARNING AND ITS PROUD OLD HISTORY
THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM WAS LOOKING ITS BEST IN THE STREAMING LIGHT OF THE MORNING SUN
OH ONLY SAID SHE REDDENING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM I FANCIED YOU MEANT SOME ONE OF A DIFFERENT CLASS NOT A GENTLEMAN
IT WAS TO HAVE YOU TO MYSELF ALL TO MYSELF A FEW HOURS LONGER THAT I BEGGED YOU NOT TO GO TILL TO-MORROW DEAREST MOTHER STILL LOVE IS SELFISH AND IN AN INSTANT HE REVERTED TO HIS OWN HOPES AND FEARS IN A WAY THAT DREW THE COLD CREEPING SHADOW OVER MRS THORNTON'S HEART BUT I KNOW SHE DOES NOT CARE FOR ME
I DUNNOT THINK I DID
HE LOOKS LIKE A PERSON WHO WOULD ENJOY BATTLING WITH EVERY ADVERSE THING HE COULD MEET WITH--ENEMIES WINDS OR CIRCUMSTANCES
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D DRESS IN BROWN AND DUST-COLOUR NOT TO SHOW THE DIRT YOU'LL PICK UP IN ALL THOSE PLACES
WHO IS THAT SAID FREDERICK ALMOST BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF HEARING
I THINK HE OUGHT TO KNOW
BUT AT THE END THE BEWILDERED WOMAN SIMPLY REPEATED HER FIRST ASSERTION NAMELY THAT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR SURE AND SHE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO IT
LET ALONE THAT WHEN DOWN IT MAY BE TOO STRONG FOR THIS ONE TOO WEAK FOR THAT
HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE
MARGARET WISHED SHE COULD HAVE HELPED FEELING THAT IT ALSO BECAME MORE PATRONISING
HE UNDERSTOOD HIS FATHER AND MOTHER--THEIR CHARACTERS AND THEIR WEAKNESSES AND WENT ALONG WITH A CARELESS FREEDOM WHICH WAS YET MOST DELICATELY CAREFUL NOT TO HURT OR WOUND ANY OF THEIR FEELINGS
THAT'S ALL WE DO I TH UNION
IT'S OUT O SIGHT OUT O MIND WI YOU I DON'T KNOW WHO THE REST ARE
SO IF YOU SAY YES I'LL JUST GO UP-STAIRS AND PROPOSE IT IT'S NO USE MY TRYING TO SAY HOW MUCH I SHALL LIKE IT SAID MARGARET THROUGH HER TEARS
TO-NIGHT HE HAS NOT BEEN LIKE HIMSELF
I AM GETTING REALLY TO KNOW SOME OF THEM NOW AND THEY TALK PRETTY FREELY BEFORE ME NOTHING LIKE THE ACT OF EATING FOR EQUALISING MEN
FOR HE CAME HOME EVERY EVENING MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED AFTER THE NECESSARY LEAVE-TAKING WHICH HE HAD RESOLVED TO HAVE WITH EVERY INDIVIDUAL PARISHIONER
I NEVER SAW A DEAD PERSON
AH I KNEW HOW YOU WOULD BE AMUSED TO FIND US ALL SO OCCUPIED IN ADMIRING FINERY
AS SOON AS THAT FORENOON SLUMBER WAS OVER SHE WOULD HELP HER MOTHER TO DRESS AFTER DINNER SHE WOULD GO AND SEE BESSY HIGGINS
THE TEARS OF WOUNDED PRIDE FELL HOT AND FAST
AND YET PERHAPS IT WAS AS WELL
HE WAS PUTTING IT UP WHEN SHE SAID I THINK IT IS A CRAMPED DAZZLING SORT OF WRITING
MARGARET FLEW TO ADJUST THE PILLOWS
OH MR BELL SHE SUDDENLY COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AS IF WISHING TO HIDE HERSELF FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE RECOLLECTION
WELL I TAKE HER FOR BOTH MR THORNTON MADE ONE OR TWO FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO SPEAK BEFORE HE COULD GET OUT THE WORDS
EDITH WAS IN THE MOOD TO THINK THAT ANY PLEASURE ENJOYED AWAY FROM HER WAS A TACIT AFFRONT OR AT BEST A PROOF OF INDIFFERENCE
IT'S THE GOOD OLD BERESFORD BLOOD
PRETTY BASKETS OF WORK STOOD ABOUT IN DIFFERENT PLACES
POOR MRS HALE HAD CRIED IN HER WAY NEARLY ALL DAY LONG
IT IS NATURAL FOR ME TO THINK OF HELSTONE CHURCH AND THE WALK TO IT RATHER THAN OF DRIVING UP TO A LONDON CHURCH IN THE MIDDLE OF A PAVED STREET TELL ME ABOUT HELSTONE
THE COLOURS LOOKED GRAYER--MORE ENDURING NOT SO GAY AND PRETTY
YOU ARE RATHER SEVERE TO-NIGHT MARGARET
MARGARET WAS ALMOST OVERPOWERED WITH THE IDEA THAT HER MOTHER KNEW NOTHING OF IT ALL AND YET THE AFFAIR WAS SO FAR ADVANCED
SHE FORCED HERSELF TO SPEAK
THEY FALL OFF FROM ME
AND EVEN IF WE WERE NEAR SUCH THINGS I DOUBT IF I SHOULD GO TO THEM I SEE YOU WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING
THE SERVANT NEXT DOOR WENT FOR HIM FOR THE CHARWOMAN IS GONE HOME
IF SO I HAD BETTER GO AT ONCE AND CALL ON THIS MR DONKIN TO WHOM THE ADVERTISEMENT REFERS ME
BUT I WOULD TAKE AN IDEA THE WORKING OUT OF WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE PERSONAL INTERCOURSE
MRS HALE TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND LAY PERFECTLY STILL IN HER MOTHER'S DESPAIR
HOWEVER THEY WERE TOO DEEP FOR HIM AND HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THE BAD PROSPECTS OF TRADE
IS MISS HALE WITHIN SHE KNEW SHE WAS FOR SHE HAD SEEN HER AT THE WINDOW AND SHE HAD HER FEET INSIDE THE LITTLE HALL BEFORE MARTHA HAD HALF ANSWERED HER QUESTION
A SMALL BRANCH--IT MIGHT BE OF ROTTEN WOOD OR IT MIGHT BE BROKEN BY FORCE--CAME HEAVILY DOWN IN THE NEAREST PART OF THE FOREST MARGARET RAN SWIFT AS CAMILLA DOWN TO THE WINDOW AND RAPPED AT IT WITH A HURRIED TREMULOUSNESS WHICH STARTLED CHARLOTTE WITHIN
AND THIS IS A DEAL FROM ME SAID MR THORNTON GIVING HIGGINS'S HAND A GOOD GRIP
BUT WHAT GRAND MAKINGS OF A MAN THERE ARE IN HIM PRIDE AND ALL IT'S AMUSING TO SEE HOW HE EVIDENTLY RESPECTS THE PART IN MR THORNTON'S CHARACTER WHICH IS LIKE HIS OWN THERE'S GRANITE IN ALL THESE NORTHERN PEOPLE PAPA IS THERE NOT THERE WAS NONE IN POOR BOUCHER I AM AFRAID
HER LONG ARMS HUNG MOTION-LESS BY HER SIDES
NO CHANGE OF COUNTENANCE
WHAT DO THEY DO
HER MUSLINS AND LACES RIVALLING NOT EXCELLING THE PURE WHITENESS OF THE MUSLINS AND NETTING OF THE ROOM
INDEED I DO
AND THEY BOTH TALK SO MUCH AND BOTH AT A TIME THAT THEY KNOCK ONE DOWN AS IT WERE AND IT'S NOT TILL THEY'RE GONE AND ONE'S A LITTLE AT PEACE THAT ONE CAN THINK THAT THERE WERE THINGS ONE MIGHT HAVE SAID ON ONE'S OWN SIDE OF THE QUESTION
I SURELY AM MISTRESS ENOUGH OF MYSELF TO CONTROL THIS WILD STRANGE MISERABLE FEELING WHICH TEMPTED ME EVEN TO BETRAY MY OWN DEAR FREDERICK SO THAT I MIGHT BUT REGAIN HIS GOOD OPINION--THE GOOD OPINION OF A MAN WHO TAKES SUCH PAINS TO TELL ME THAT I AM NOTHING TO HIM
AND AT HELSTONE WE HAVE HAD THEM UP FOR A MONTH OR MORE AND THEY HAVE NOT LOOKED DIRTY AT THE END OF THAT TIME
THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL ALLOW THAT IF EXPLAINED MAY TAKE OFF FROM THE SEEMING IMPROPRIETY STILL NO ANSWER
THE BRIGHT COLOUR CAME FOR A MOMENT INTO HER FACE WHEN HE ASKED TO EXAMINE THE WOUND IN HER FOREHEAD
HE'LL BE COMING TO-NIGHT I RECKON ABOUT THEM CHILDER'S SCHOOLING
I LITTLE THOUGHT YOU WERE MAKING OLD ISAAC AND ME INTO SUBJECTS WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO ASK HIM THE HISTORY OF THESE COTTAGES IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE
BUT HIS PLAN THAT IS TO BE PROPOSED EVIDENTLY RELATES TO THAT
WE WISH PEOPLE WOULD ALLOW US TO RIGHT OURSELVES INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MEDDLING WITH THEIR IMPERFECT LEGISLATION
MEANWHILE HE COMES HERE PRETTY OFTEN
BUT YO'RE NOT A COMMON WENCH AXING YO'R PARDON NOR YET HAVE YO COMMON WAYS ABOUT YO I'LL E'EN MAKE A WRY FACE AND GO AT IT TO-MORROW
THE SIGHT OF HER DISTRESS MADE MR HALE NERVE HIMSELF IN ORDER TO TRY AND COMFORT HER
I DON'T MEAN NO REPROACH TO NOBODY
YOU DO KNOW
THAT HER ARMS HAD BEEN ROUND HIM ONCE--IF NEVER AGAIN
STAY WE'LL GO ACROSS THE YARD
FOR SHE STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR ENEMY
AND HE CARED FOR THEIR UNCONSCIOUS DEFERENCE NO MORE THAN FOR THE SOFT WEST WIND THAT SCARCELY MADE THE SMOKE FROM THE GREAT TALL CHIMNEYS SWERVE IN ITS STRAIGHT UPWARD COURSE
AND SHE HAS BEEN A LITTLE MYSTERIOUS ABOUT MAMMA'S HEALTH WHICH HAS ALARMED ME RATHER THAT IS ALL
THOSE NEAREST THE GATE STOLE OUT ASHAMED
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IF NEED WERE THOUGH IT DOES LEAD ME INTO ALL THIS SHAME AND TROUBLE CHAPTER XXV FREDERICK REVENGE MAY HAVE HER OWN
IN THE COUNTRY
AT LAST MR THORNTON RETURNED
BEFORE THAT WEDNESDAY--THAT MOURNFUL WEDNESDAY WHEN MR HALE WAS TO BE INTERRED FAR AWAY FROM EITHER OF THE HOMES HE HAD KNOWN IN LIFE AND FAR AWAY FROM THE WIFE WHO LAY LONELY AMONG STRANGERS AND THIS LAST WAS MARGARET'S GREAT TROUBLE FOR SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE HAD NOT GIVEN WAY TO THAT OVERWHELMING STUPOR DURING THE FIRST SAD DAYS SHE COULD HAVE ARRANGED THINGS OTHERWISE)--BEFORE THAT WEDNESDAY MARGARET RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR BELL
AND THOUGH SHE MADE THEM PUNCTUALLY AND PAINFULLY YET SHE STOOD AS FAR OFF AS EVER FROM ANY CHEERFULNESS
I TOOK HIM FOR A SHOPMAN AND HE TURNS OUT A MANUFACTURER MARGARET WAS SILENT
BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL THEY ARE WANTING HIGHER WAGES I SUPPOSE ASKED MR HALE
IF SHE COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THEM HOW SHE WOULD HAVE SHRUNK AWAY AND HID HERSELF FROM THE COMING TIME
AND SHE HERSELF GAINED STRENGTH BY DOING THIS
BUT LET US KNOW EACH OTHER AND SPEAK FREELY TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL
THEY WERE PACKED INTO A BASKET AND THE SHOPMAN AWAITED THE ANSWER TO HIS INQUIRY WHERE SHALL WE SEND THEM TO SIR THERE WAS NO REPLY
SHE WAS ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS AND HAD LEARNT BY THIS TIME TO THREAD HER WAY THROUGH THE IRREGULAR STREAM OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT FLOWED THROUGH MILTON STREETS
YOUR WHAT D'YE CALL HIM
THE MEN ARE NOT COME BACK AND WE SHALL HAVE IT TO OURSELVES
MARGARET WAS ALONE
BUT HER FATHER INCLINED TO CULL FASTIDIOUSLY THE VERY ZEST AND PERFECTION OF THE HOUR HE HAD STOLEN FROM HIS ANXIETY CHOSE DAINTILY THE RIPEST FRUIT AND SAT DOWN ON THE GARDEN BENCH TO ENJOY IT AT HIS LEISURE
HIS VISIT WOULD FORCE HER FATHER'S THOUGHTS INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
SO IT IS BEST TO START WITH A FORMAL AGREEMENT
ASK TH MASTERS
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
AFTER THIS EVENING ALL WAS BUSTLE TILL THE WEDDING WAS OVER
CAPTAIN LENNOX HAD COME EARLIER THAN WAS EXPECTED
STAY SAID HE HIS EYE CATCHING ON MARGARET'S FACE BLANCHED WITH WATCHING IN A SICK ROOM I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I CAN GO
AN I HA CALLED YOU A TYRANT AN AN OUD BULL-DOG AND A HARD CRUEL MASTER
WITH THIS BRIEF EXPLANATION THE TALE IS COMMENDED TO THE KINDNESS OF THE READER
THERE MUST BE NO LINGERING NOW FOR HIS SAKE AS WELL AS FROM EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION
HE HAD TO COMPLETE THE ARRANGEMENTS ONLY HALF MADE IN THE MORNING FOR THE COMFORT AND SAFETY OF HIS NEWLY IMPORTED IRISH HANDS
HE MADE HER TAKE A CHAIR BY HIM
MRS HALE WAKENED WHILE THEY WERE THUS ENGAGED
BUT YOUR WHOLE MANNER OFFENDS ME HOW EXCLAIMED HE
NOW FANNY SAID HE I TRUST YOU HAVE DELICACY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS AS GREAT AN INJURY TO MISS HALE AS TO ME--IN FACT SHE WOULD THINK IT A GREATER--TO SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE ANY REASON MORE THAN I NOW GIVE FOR BEGGING YOU AND MY MOTHER TO SHOW HER EVERY KINDLY ATTENTION I CANNOT FORGIVE HER HER PRIDE SAID HIS MOTHER
THE SMOOTH SEA OF THAT OLD LIFE CLOSED UP WITHOUT A MARK LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY HAD ALL BEEN
AT LEAST YOU SHALL HAVE SOME COMFORTABLE FOOD WHICH I'M SURE YOU NEED YO'R FATHER'S A PARSON ASKED HE WITH A SUDDEN TURN IN HIS IDEAS
SHE WENT FOR A PLATE IN SILENCE AND LIFTED THE FRUIT OUT TENDERLY WITH THE POINTS OF HER DELICATE TAPER FINGERS
THEY MET CONTINUALLY OF COURSE BUT SHE THOUGHT THAT HE RATHER AVOIDED BEING ALONE WITH HER
I WONDER WHERE THEY GET IT FROM AND SHE WHO WOULD HAVE RESENTED SUCH WORDS FROM ANY ONE LESS HAUGHTY AND DETERMINED IN MANNER WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH TO SAY IN A HALF HUMBLE HALF INJURED TONE
HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
BUT IT WILL NOT BE FOR LONG FREDERICK BENT DOWN AND KISSED THE FEEBLE HAND THAT IMPRISONED HIS
JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND MR HENRY LENNOX WAS SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED
HER FATHER HAD RESUMED THEIR READINGS TOGETHER AND QUOTED HIS OPINIONS PERPETUALLY
AND IT WAS TOO DELICIOUS TO FEEL HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS FOR HIM TO WISH TO SEE EITHER DEEP BLUSHES OR LOVING EYES
CAPTAIN LENNOX MARRIED HER COUSIN--THE GIRL SHE WAS BROUGHT UP WITH
THE FIRST TOUCH OF FROST WOULD LAY THEM ALL LOW ON THE GROUND
SHE LAUGHED AND BLUSHED
GOOD ENOUGH PEOPLE I DARE SAY
MR THORNTON'S MILL MUST BE SOMEWHERE NOT VERY FAR OFF FOR HE IS MR BELL'S TENANT
IT WILL WAKEN UP ALL THE POOR SPRINGS OF HEALTH LEFT IN ME
THE SKIN IS GRAZED AND I WAS STUNNED AT THE MOMENT
ALL MORNING SHE TOILED ON LONGING FOR REST BUT IN A CONTINUAL WHIRL OF MELANCHOLY BUSINESS
HOW YOU STARTLED ME
SHE'S AS SWEET AS A NUT
THERE WERE ONLY SOME RAILWAY OFFICIALS STANDING ABOUT
BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND MARGARET HAD IMAGINED NOTHING LESS THAN THAT SOME OF THE PREFERMENTS WHICH HER MOTHER SO MUCH DESIRED HAD BEFALLEN HER FATHER AT LAST--SOMETHING THAT WOULD FORCE HIM TO LEAVE BEAUTIFUL BELOVED HELSTONE AND PERHAPS COMPEL HIM TO GO AND LIVE IN SOME OF THE STATELY AND SILENT CLOSES WHICH MARGARET HAD SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN CATHEDRAL TOWNS
WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE BRIDESMAIDS DRESSES AND BREAKFASTS AT THAT INTERESTING CEREMONY
WE SHALL WRITE OFTEN TO ONE ANOTHER AND I WILL PROMISE--FOR I SEE IT WILL SET YOUR MIND AT EASE--TO TELL YOU EVERY WORRY I HAVE
THE ELEMENTS OF THE DINNER-PARTIES WHICH MRS LENNOX GAVE WERE THESE
AND SHE FELT THAT IT WAS ALMOST UNGRATEFUL IN HER TO HAVE A SECRET FEELING THAT THE HELSTONE VICARAGE--NAY EVEN THE POOR LITTLE HOUSE AT MILTON WITH HER ANXIOUS FATHER AND HER INVALID MOTHER AND ALL THE SMALL HOUSEHOLD CARES OF COMPARATIVE POVERTY COMPOSED HER IDEA OF HOME
AND WHEN SHE SAW HER AUNT SHE WENT FORWARD TO THE ARMS OPEN TO RECEIVE HER AND FIRST FOUND THE PASSIONATE RELIEF OF TEARS ON HER AUNT'S SHOULDER
TRENCH
AH SAID SHE CLENCHING HER HANDS TOGETHER IT IS NO WONDER THOSE PEOPLE THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM AFTER DISGRACING MYSELF IN THAT WAY
WHY I SHOULD NOT BE ILL--BE DYING--IF HE HAD NOT TAKEN ME AWAY FROM HELSTONE TO THIS UNHEALTHY SMOKY SUNLESS PLACE OH MAMMA SAID MARGARET
HARD I SAY MOST TRULY FOR HER HEART SEEMED DEAD TO THE END OF ALL HER EFFORTS
POOR OLD HALE
POOR OLD HALE
POOR OLD HALE
WHY I WAS HERE THEN
FOR ALL I TELLED HAMPER THAT LET ALONE HIS PLEDGE--WHICH I WOULD NOT SIGN--NO I COULD NA NOT E'EN FOR THIS--HE'D NE'ER HA SUCH A WORKER ON HIS MILL AS I WOULD BE--HE'D HA NONE O ME--NO MORE WOULD NONE O TH OTHERS
THE NEXT DAY SHE HAD THE LITTLE BOUCHER CHILDREN FOR THEIR LESSONS AND TOOK A LONG WALK AND ENDED BY A VISIT TO MARY HIGGINS
IT WAS A HOT SUMMER'S EVENING
AND YOU DON'T KNOW MILTON
IT IS DONE--MY SIN IS SINNED
I'M A MEMBER O THE UNION
SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
IF I COULD JUST HEAR HER VOICE READING ME SOME WORDS O PEACE AND PROMISE I COULD DIE AWAY INTO THE SILENCE AND REST O GOD JUST AS A BABBY IS HUSHED UP TO SLEEP BY ITS MOTHER'S LULLABY SHALL I READ YOU A CHAPTER NOW AY DO
IT WON'T BE DIVISION ENOUGH IN THAT AWFUL DAY THAT SOME OF US HAVE BEEN BEGGARS HERE AND SOME OF US HAVE BEEN RICH,--WE SHALL NOT BE JUDGED BY THAT POOR ACCIDENT BUT BY OUR FAITHFUL FOLLOWING OF CHRIST MARGARET GOT UP AND FOUND SOME WATER AND SOAKING HER POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF IN IT SHE LAID THE COOL WETNESS ON BESSY'S FOREHEAD AND BEGAN TO CHAFE THE STONE-COLD FEET
BUT SHE SEEMED JUST AS GRIM AND QUIET AS USUAL WHEN HE NEXT SPOKE
THERE WAS EVEN A SHADE OF TENDERNESS IN HER MANNER AS SHE NOTICED THE WHITE TEAR-SWOLLEN FACE AND THE QUIVER IN THE VOICE WHICH MARGARET TRIED TO MAKE SO STEADY
WE ALWAYS SAW WHEN SHE HAD HER HEADACHES AT HELSTONE EVEN WITHOUT HER TELLING US
YOU MUST NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF INTO DOUBTING THE REALITY OF MY WORDS--MY FIXED INTENTION AND RESOLVE HE LOOKED AT HER IN THE SAME STEADY STONY MANNER FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
PERHAPS I MAY ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME DOWNSTAIRS AND BAR THE DOOR BEHIND ME
HE ENQUIRED FROM EDITH WHO THAT GENTLEMAN WAS
BUT I KNEW TOO WELL WHAT YOUR REAL FEELINGS WERE TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD EVER LIKE MR THORNTON IN THAT WAY
THEY FOR MRS SHAW ALIGHTED HERE WERE SHOWN INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM IN WHICH A FIRE HAD ONLY JUST BEEN KINDLED
BUT SHE ROUSED UP INTO QUERULOUSNESS AT THIS SPEECH OF HER HUSBAND'S
MARGARET TOOK PAINS TO RESPOND TO EVERY CALL MADE UPON HER FOR SYMPATHY--AND THEY WERE MANY--EVEN WHEN THEY BORE RELATION TO TRIFLES WHICH SHE WOULD NO MORE HAVE NOTICED OR REGARDED HERSELF THAN THE ELEPHANT WOULD PERCEIVE THE LITTLE PIN AT HIS FEET WHICH YET HE LIFTS CAREFULLY UP AT THE BIDDING OF HIS KEEPER
SHE HAD JUST BEEN LETTING OUT MR THORNTON
THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER ATTACHMENT HAD FALLEN THROUGH AND THAT IT SUITED MISS HALE'S PURPOSE TO RECALL HER REJECTED LOVER
I SHALL GO HOME TO MY MOTHER WHO IS SO ILL--SO ILL BESSY THAT THERE'S NO OUTLET BUT DEATH FOR HER OUT OF THE PRISON OF HER GREAT SUFFERING
SHE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING THOUGH EACH NEW PROJECT WAS A STAB TO HER HEART
MR LOWE RETURNED IN THE CAB
BUT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP IN DESPAIR
SO THE ENERGY CAME OUT IN DOING RATHER THAN IN SPEAKING
CHAPTER XXXVI UNION NOT ALWAYS STRENGTH THE STEPS OF THE BEARERS HEAVY AND SLOW THE SOBS OF THE MOURNERS DEEP AND LOW SHELLEY
YOU COULD NOT STAND IT
YOU HAD APPARENTLY CHANGED YOUR MIND
HE HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM OXFORD
AND LED TO TH RIOT THAT RUINED TH STRIKE
FREDERICK'S GODFATHER--YOUR OLD TUTOR AT OXFORD DON'T YOU MEAN YES
SOMETHING I KNOW OF OLD YOU MUST HAVE TO WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HAPPY
THEY MAY SAY THEY DO FOR FORM'S SAKE
REALLY JOHN ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MISS HALE HAD DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU CLEAR-SIGHTED
YO'VE CALLED ME IMPUDENT AND A LIAR AND A MISCHIEF-MAKER AND YO MIGHT HA SAID WI SOME TRUTH AS I WERE NOW AND THEN GIVEN TO DRINK
BUT HE SEEMED LIKE A RELIC OF HELSTONE--HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A BRIGHT MORNING AN EVENTFUL DAY AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN HIM WITHOUT HIS SEEING HER,--WITHOUT THE CHANCE OF THEIR SPEAKING
THEY HAD NEVER EXCHANGED A WORD
BUT YO'D ADVISED ME FOR TO COME AND I WERE BEHOLDEN TO YO YOU TOLD HIM I SENT YOU I DUNNO IF I CA'D YO BY YOUR NAME
BUT ON HIS RETURN HER EYES AND EARS WERE KEEN TO SEE AND TO LISTEN TO ALL THE DETAILS WHICH HE COULD GIVE AS TO THE STEPS HE HAD TAKEN TO SECURE HIMSELF AND THOSE WHOM HE CHOSE TO EMPLOY FROM ANY REPETITION OF THE DAY'S OUTRAGES
FOR FORTY YEARS THIS RUMOUR KEPT RISING AND FALLING--NEVER UTTERLY DYING AWAY
I HAVE BEEN HOPING FOR THESE THREE MONTHS PAST TO FIND YOU REGRETTING LONDON--AND LONDON FRIENDS A LITTLE--ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU LISTEN MORE KINDLY FOR SHE WAS QUIETLY BUT FIRMLY STRIVING TO EXTRICATE HER HAND FROM HIS GRASP TO ONE WHO HAS NOT MUCH TO OFFER IT IS TRUE--NOTHING BUT PROSPECTS IN THE FUTURE--BUT WHO DOES LOVE YOU MARGARET ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
AND I WANT EDITH TO KNOW YOU
HE HAD THUS UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITIES OF INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH HER BESIDES THOSE THAT AROSE FROM THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES
ABUSED HER ROUNDLY
HIGGINS LOOKED AWKWARD AND ASHAMED
SPEAK OUT DON'T BE AFRAID OH MR BELL SAID SHE--AND COULD SAY NO MORE
MR BELL HAD SENT ALL SORTS OF ORDERS ABOUT THE BOOKS
THEY WERE CLEVER LETTERS
GROUND US TO POWDER
TH FOLK ARE ALL COMING UP HERE I RECKON ASKED HE
AND MARGARET DREW INTO A CORNER NEAR HER MOTHER WITH HER WORK AFTER THE TEA-THINGS WERE TAKEN AWAY
THERE WAS NO INVALID TO HOPE AND FEAR ABOUT
AND I HAVE PUT TEA IN MASTER'S STUDY AS BEING THE MOST COMFORTABLE ROOM SO TO SPEAK THANK YOU CHARLOTTE
I FALL SLOWLY INTO NEW PROJECTS
AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
AND I AM NOT GOING WITH MAMMA
SHE STOOD AS A LIAR IN HIS EYES
BUT I MANAGE PRETTY WELL GETTING IN GREAT STOCKS FROM LIVERPOOL AND BEING SERVED IN BUTCHER'S MEAT BY OUR OWN FAMILY BUTCHER
I MUST GIVE UP BUSINESS BUT I PAY ALL MEN
SUCH A GENTLEMAN AS HE WAS TOO
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FUNERAL CAME A STATELY NOTE FROM MRS THORNTON TO MISS HALE SAYING THAT AT HER SON'S DESIRE THEIR CARRIAGE SHOULD ATTEND THE FUNERAL IF IT WOULD NOT BE DISAGREEABLE TO THE FAMILY
AND I MISS HER SADLY
OUR ONLY CHANCE IS BINDING MEN TOGETHER IN ONE COMMON INTEREST
SHE USED TO BE CONSIDERED A FAMOUS COOK AS FAR AS HELSTONE OPINION WENT BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE DISTRACTION OF MIND PRODUCED BY ALL THIS HAYMAKING MARGARET FELT ALL MR BELL'S KINDNESS IN TRYING TO MAKE CHEERFUL TALK ABOUT NOTHING TO ENDEAVOUR TO PREVENT HER FROM THINKING TOO CURIOUSLY ABOUT THE PAST
HIS BLUE-BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS
BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE LIVING--A CLEVER SENSIBLE MAN AND A THOROUGHLY ACTIVE CLERGYMAN--THAT THERE WAS NO CALL UPON MR HALE TO DO WHAT HE DID RELINQUISH THE LIVING AND THROW HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY ON THE TENDER MERCIES OF PRIVATE TEACHING IN A MANUFACTURING TOWN
I HAVE NEVER LOVED ANY WOMAN BEFORE
CAN YOU STAND IT MARGARET
OR THE BAD AIR FROM SOME OF THE STAGNANT PONDS OH MAMMA SAID MARGARET FAINTLY SMILING AS SHE KISSED HER MOTHER I AM QUITE WELL--DON'T ALARM YOURSELF ABOUT ME
HAVE THEY BEEN LABOURING TO EXHORT TO ENJOIN TO ACT RIGHTLY FOR THE SAKE OF EXAMPLE OR HAVE THEY BEEN SIMPLE TRUE MEN TAKING UP THEIR DUTY AND DOING IT UNFLINCHINGLY WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF HOW THEIR ACTIONS WERE TO MAKE THIS MAN INDUSTRIOUS THAT MAN SAVING
IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S GREEDY EARS THAT SUCKED IN FROM THE WOMEN-KIND OF THESE MAGISTRATES AND WEALTHY MEN HOW HIGHLY MR THIS OR MR THAT THOUGHT OF MR THORNTON
I SUPPOSE THEY'RE WELL
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE I HAVE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO WARN YOU AGAINST SUCH IMPROPRIETIES
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
WHERE IS HE ASKED HE AT LAST HIS FACE STILL HIDDEN IN HIS PROSTRATE ARMS
AS THE THREE PREPARED FOR BED MR BELL MUTTERED FORTH A LITTLE CONDEMNATION OF MR THORNTON
HE'S LIABLE TO BE ARRESTED THE MOMENT HE SETS FOOT ON ENGLISH GROUND
HE HAD A SON--AN OVERGROWN MAN WITH THE UNEXERCISED INTELLECT OF A CHILD WHOM HE HAD KEPT UP IN THAT STRANGE WAY IN ORDER TO SAVE HIM FROM TEMPTATION AND ERROR
BUT WE ARE EDUCATED PEOPLE AND HAVE LIVED AMONGST EDUCATED PEOPLE
AND AS I UNDERSTOOD FROM WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID YOU WOULD BE BACK IN AN HOUR I TOLD HIM SO AND HE CAME AGAIN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO AND SAID HE WOULD WAIT FOR MR HALE
I HAVE APPOINTED TO MEET CAPTAIN HANBURY IN HALF AN HOUR AT THE STATION YOU MUST HAVE SOME TEA FIRST TEA
I MUST HAVE COME AND FETCHED HER AND MARGARET AWAY AND TO HERSELF SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT HER BROTHER-IN-LAW RATHER A WEAK MAN BUT NEVER SO WEAK AS NOW WHEN SHE SAW FOR WHAT A PLACE HE HAD EXCHANGED THE LOVELY HELSTONE HOME
MARGARET WAS ONLY TOO WILLING TO LISTEN AS LONG AS HE TALKED OF MILTON THOUGH HE HAD SEEN NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE MORE ESPECIALLY KNEW
BUT THERE WAS SUCH A NOISE AS OF MANY LITTLE ILL-ORDERED CHILDREN THAT SHE COULD HEAR NO REPLY
EVEN THE MOST DESPERATE--BOUCHER HIMSELF--DREW BACK FALTERED AWAY SCOWLED AND FINALLY WENT OFF MUTTERING CURSES ON THE MASTER WHO STOOD IN HIS UNCHANGING ATTITUDE LOOKING AFTER THEIR RETREAT WITH DEFIANT EYES
HE GOT UP HASTILY AND TRIED TO FORGET WHAT NEVER MORE MIGHT BE IN A HURRIED DRESSING FOR THE BREAKFAST IN HARLEY STREET
BUT SUCH AN IDEA NEVER CROSSED MARGARET'S MIND
AND SO HE HAD TO THINK AND TALK AND REASON
EXCEPT THE MEN CUT THEIR OWN THROATS WI STRIKING LIKE THE CONFOUNDED NOODLES THEY ARE WELL NOW SIR I PUT IT TO YO BEING A PARSON AND HAVING BEEN IN TH PREACHING LINE AND HAVING HAD TO TRY AND BRING FOLK O'ER TO WHAT YO THOUGHT WAS A RIGHT WAY O THINKING--DID YO BEGIN BY CALLING EM FOOLS AND SUCH LIKE OR DIDN'T YO RAYTHER GIVE EM SOME KIND WORDS AT FIRST TO MAKE EM READY FOR TO LISTEN AND BE CONVINCED IF THEY COULD
I WOULD BEFRIEND JEZEBEL HERSELF IF YOU ASKED ME
NOT AT ALL
BUT AT SUCH TIMES MARGARET HERSELF WAS SECURE OF DRIFTING WITHOUT ANY EXERTION OF HER OWN INTO THE QUIET HARBOUR OF HOME
IF SO HIS EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT WILL MAKE HIM MUCH CONSULTED BY HIS FRIENDS
BUT--MR BELL--HAVE YOU COME FROM OXFORD OR FROM MILTON FROM MILTON
HER DRY DIM EYES FILLED WITH UNWONTED TEARS AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM
I AM ONLY SO SORRY WE CANNOT OFFER HIM A BED-ROOM THANK YOU
BUT DON'T FORM ONE OF YOUR HASTY FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE DAUGHTER
MARGARET TOLD HIM WHAT DR DONALDSON SAID
THAT WAS ALL
BUT HE SHOULD HA MADE A DEAL MORE ON HER AND NOT BEEN ALWAYS READING READING THINKING THINKING
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ME AT NO RATE
STILL WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED HE SHOOK HER OFF
WHAT COULD IT BE
BUT IT WILL DO NICELY FOR TO-MORROW VERY SAID MARGARET
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW WE LAUGHED AT THE NUMBER COMPARED WITH THE THREE BED-ROOMS
I HAVE A HEART NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS GOOD-FOR-NOTHING WAY OF TALKING
HIS TENDERNESS RELEASED HER TEARS
BUT SHE LINGERED STRANGELY
WHY THEY ARE A LOOKING THIS WAY
HE WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT THE PRESENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARGARET AND HIMSELF OF CLIENT AND LEGAL ADVISER WAS GRADUALLY SUPERSEDING THE RECOLLECTION OF THAT UNLUCKY MISMANAGED DAY AT HELSTONE
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMFORT TO ME TO THINK THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS SO SIMPLE AND OPEN THAT I KNEW EVERY LITTLE GRIEVANCE SHE HAD
BUT AS MY MOTHER HAS NOT MURDERED MY FATHER AND AFTERWARDS MARRIED MY UNCLE I SHOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT UNLESS IT WERE BALANCING THE CHANCES OF OUR HAVING A WELL-COOKED DINNER OR NOT
NO REPLIED MRS HALE HER CHEEK FLUSHING
SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST IT IS NOTHING ABOUT FREDERICK
THE EYES THAT SAW HER DO THIS FOLLOWED HER AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM HER PIOUS OFFICE AND WERE THUS LED TO THE PLACE WHERE NICHOLAS HIGGINS STOOD LIKE ONE ROOTED TO THE SPOT
IT'S AS GOOD AS AN ORGAN AND AS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY DAY TOO
MANY VOICES WERE HUSHED AND LOW
NOW ON THESE COMMONS I RECKON THERE IS BUT LITTLE NOISE NO SAID MARGARET
HE ONCE OR TWICE SPOKE TO HIS BROTHER IN MARGARET'S PRESENCE IN A PRETTY SHARP TONE OF ENQUIRY AS TO WHETHER HE MEANT ENTIRELY TO RELINQUISH HIS PROFESSION
IT WAS NOT THAT MARGARET HAD NOT BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE RESULT BEFORE
BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE A PIS ALLER
MARGARET BE ON MY SIDE NO--NO MORE REMOVALS FOR ME SAID MR HALE
WE'LL BE A GREAT DEAL TO ONE ANOTHER IF WE ARE THROWN OFF AND LEFT DESOLATE HER FATHER WAS ALMOST STARTLED BY HER MERRIMENT THIS AFTERNOON
THAT IS MY BONNET
AS DIXON SAID ANY ONE BUT A GENTLEMAN--INDEED ALMOST ANY OTHER GENTLEMAN BUT CATCHING A LOOK AT MARGARET'S STRAIGHT STERN BROW JUST HERE SHE COUGHED THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE AWAY AND MEEKLY TOOK THE HOREHOUND DROP THAT MARGARET OFFERED HER TO STOP THE LITTLE TICKLING AT MY CHEST MISS BUT ALMOST ANY ONE BUT MR HALE WOULD HAVE HAD PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IN SO SHORT A TIME IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIX ON ANY HOUSE IN MILTON-NORTHERN OR INDEED ELSEWHERE TO WHICH THEY COULD REMOVE THE FURNITURE THAT HAD OF NECESSITY TO BE TAKEN OUT OF HELSTONE VICARAGE
SO I'M FREE TO MAKE ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT
MARGARET HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TELLING HER COUSIN OF SOME OF THE PLANS AND VISIONS WHICH SHE ENTERTAINED AS TO HER FUTURE LIFE IN THE COUNTRY PARSONAGE WHERE HER FATHER AND MOTHER LIVED
I WILL CARRY YOUR BAG AND SHE TOOK HIM BY THE ARM TO PUSH HIM ALONG WITH ALL HER FEEBLE FORCE
SPEAK TO HER MISS FANNY ARE YOU BETTER NOW ASKED FANNY IN A QUAVERING VOICE
SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM
BUT THAT SHE--NO
THEN YOU SEE SHE CAN'T BE FRETTING AFTER THEM EH
THE SERVANT WHO ENTERED HIS ROOM IN THE MORNING RECEIVED NO ANSWER TO HIS SPEECH
BUT I AM NOT A HOPEFUL MAN SUDDENLY AS IF A NEW IDEA HAD STRUCK HIM HE CROSSED OVER TO WHERE MARGARET WAS SITTING AND BEGAN WITHOUT PREFACE AS IF HE KNEW SHE HAD BEEN LISTENING TO ALL THAT HAD PASSED
HE MUST HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME I'M AFRAID IT SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY LONG TO ME
HE HAD HARDLY GONE TEN STEPS IN THE STREET BEFORE A PASSING OMNIBUS STOPPED CLOSE BY HIM AND A MAN GOT DOWN AND CAME UP TO HIM TOUCHING HIS HAT AS HE DID SO
THERE ARE A FEW BROWN BEURRES AGAINST THE SOUTH WALL WHICH ARE WORTH ALL FOREIGN FRUITS AND PRESERVES
I MYSELF LONG TO BE ALONE
WHAT SORT OF A MASTER IS HE DID YO EVER SEE A BULLDOG
IT'S THAT THAT'S FRETTING ME
AS FOR MRS HALE I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHE IS LIKE TO-NIGHT IF YOU CARE TO HEAR HE SHUT THE DOOR AND WAS GONE
SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER HER--NOT ONE WORD
AT LAST SHE SAID LET US TALK ABOUT IT SOMETIMES IF YOU THINK IT TRUE
REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS SHE WAS STARTLED BY HEARING NICHOLAS SPEAK BEHIND HER
I AM RIGHT AND YOU ARE WRONG MOST NOBLE CAPTAIN
AND SHE KNEW NOT HOW IN HIS CHANGE OF OPINIONS HE WOULD REPLY IF THE DEPTH OF HER SOUL CALLED UNTO HIS
THEM'S REALITIES
BUT HE STERNLY CHARGED THE POLICE TO BE ON THE WATCH
IS THIS FACE ALL WET WITH TEARS
ROSEWATER SURGERY WON'T DO FOR THEM
IT WAS BETTER THAN WETTING OUR SPONGE WITH OUR TEARS
IT IS BUT A NEW BROOM AT PRESENT AND SWEEPS CLEAN ENOUGH
MR THORNTON
MR THORNTON
IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE FELT IT AS AN OBSTACLE IN HIS PROGRESS TO THE OBJECT HE HAD IN VIEW
HE WAS NEVER TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT THEM
AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE
AND SHE OF COURSE WAS EVEN LESS MISSED
IT'S TOO LATE FOR TO-NIGHT I'M AFRAID FOR MISSUS IS NEARLY ASLEEP
DID HE ASK FOR ME
NO MORE HAVE I
NO INDEED MR HALE IT WAS THOSE BEDS AT SIR JOHN'S
BUT THIS MAN THIS HIDDEN LOVER SHARED WITH NOBODY
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS INTELLIGIBLE TO MR THORNTON WHO MIGHT ALREADY FOR AUGHT SHE KNEW BE AWARE OF THE OLD ACCUSATION AGAINST FREDERICK THROUGH THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND MR BELL
SOMETHING MUST HAVE ANNOYED HIM BEFORE HE CAME HERE MR BELL GAVE HER ONE OF HIS SHARP GLANCES FROM ABOVE HIS SPECTACLES
THAT'S ENOUGH SAID HE REDDENING WITH AWKWARDNESS
BUT HE HAD SOME PRIDE IN CONCEALING IT
I SHALL CALL DIXON IF YOUR MOTHER NEEDS ANYTHING
BUT AT THE TIME HER ATTENTION WAS TAKEN UP BY EDITH'S EXCLAMATIONS
AND MARY
AS SHE REALISED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHE GREW TO BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT WAS
AND DIXON IS WASHING MY MUSLINS AND LACES AND THERE IS NO SOFT WATER WITH THESE HORRID EAST WINDS WHICH I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE ALL THE YEAR ROUND IN MILTON THE WIND IS VEERING ROUND MY DEAR SAID MR HALE LOOKING OUT AT THE SMOKE WHICH DRIFTED RIGHT FROM THE EAST ONLY HE DID NOT YET UNDERSTAND THE POINTS OF THE COMPASS AND RATHER ARRANGED THEM AD LIBITUM ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES
INDEED MARGARET YOU ARE GROWING FANCIFUL
YOU'RE SUFFERING NOW FROM HAVING LIVED SO LONG IN THAT MILTON AIR
MAID AND ALL
IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE,--STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
THERE'S EVER SO MANY COME UP AND SOLDIERS TOO AND YET YOU'RE AFRAID TO GO
THORNTON IS SAFE SAY THEY
IT WAS I--BLAME ME SHE KNELT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND CAUGHT HER HAND--SHE WOULD NOT LET IT GO THOUGH MRS HALE TRIED TO PULL IT AWAY
THAT HE ALWAYS WENT SOMEWHERE DURING THE LONG VACATION AND DID NOT SEE WHY HE SHOULD NOT GO TO SPAIN AS WELL AS ANYWHERE ELSE
NOW I LOVE AND WILL LOVE
HE HAD A TIMID FEARFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES
THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART OVER SOME TRIFLE CONNECTED WITH HELSTONE AND HER FATHER'S POSITION THERE WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN SPENDING HER HOLIDAYS AT HOME BEFORE
BESIDES IN A COUNTRY PARISH I SHOULD BE SO PAINFULLY REMINDED OF HELSTONE AND MY DUTIES HERE
I MEAN I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR APPLICATION OF THE WORD
TAKE NO FURTHER STEPS
MARGARET COULD NOT REPLY
AND MAMMA IS SEEING ABOUT THEIR FOOD AND JOHN IS SPEAKING TO THEM FOR SOME OF THE WOMEN ARE CRYING TO GO BACK
HE PLAYED WITH SOME PAPERS ON THE TABLE IN A NERVOUS AND CONFUSED MANNER OPENING HIS LIPS TO SPEAK SEVERAL TIMES BUT CLOSING THEM AGAIN WITHOUT HAVING THE COURAGE TO UTTER A WORD
THOUGH I THINK HELSTONE IS ABOUT AS PERFECT A PLACE AS ANY IN THE WORLD
THEY HEARD HER WALK THE LENGTH OF THE PASSAGE INTO THE KITCHEN
AND RETURNING TO THE FACT OF THE ENGAGEMENT SHE BEGAN TO CONSIDER IT IN SOME FRESH LIGHT
AND HAD RATHER URGED ON THE MARRIAGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS BELOW THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH MANY OF EDITH'S ACQUAINTANCES HAD FORMED FOR HER A YOUNG AND PRETTY HEIRESS
WHAT TASTE
WHAT TASTE
NOW MIND YOU COME SHARP TO YOUR TIME CONTINUED HE RESUMING THE MASTER
I AM SURE THAT WHAT WAS MEANT WAS IGNORANCE OF THE WISDOM THAT SHALL GUIDE MEN AND WOMEN
I SAID TO MYSEL I'D KEEP A CIVIL TONGUE IN MY HEAD LET WHO WOULD SAY WHAT EM WOULD
BUT IF SHE IS IN THE SAME MIND ANOTHER YEAR SHE IS TO BE MY WIFE
BUT TO-DAY WHEN I'M LEFT DESOLATE I WUNNOT LISTEN TO YO WI YO'R QUESTIONS AND YO'R DOUBTS
HE HAD NEVER NAMED IT AT HELSTONE DURING ALL THAT SUNNY DAY OF LEISURE
MRS HALE HERSELF WAS NOT AWARE WHEN SHE AWOKE HOW ILL SHE HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
TO HOLD AND MAINTAIN A HIGH HONOURABLE PLACE AMONG THE MERCHANTS OF HIS COUNTRY--THE MEN OF HIS TOWN
ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE COME BY HERSELF AT SUCH A TIME
MASTER HAS GOT THE TRAY ALL READY I KNOW MARGARET DID NOT REPLY
BUT I CAN BIDE MY TIME IF SHE'S ILL
BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MR HALE'S LAST SPEECH
LOOK WHAT THEY HAVE INSTEAD OF GAME MRS HALE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN INTERESTED,--SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASTONISHED IF SHE HAD SEEN THE SUMPTUOUSNESS OF THE DINNER-TABLE AND ITS APPOINTMENTS
SHE CONTINUED RESOLUTELY SILENT
YOU ARE SADLY OVERDONE MARGARET
IT WAS ONLY THAT THE DETAILS OF EACH SUCCESSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT CAME WITH SUCH RELENTLESS MINUTENESS TO QUENCH ALL HOPE THAT SHE AT LAST FAIRLY GAVE WAY TO TEARS
ALL OF WHICH MADE MARGARET CRY SORELY SO UNNATURAL DID IT SEEM TO HER AT THE FIRST OPENING
LET HER GO,--WITH HER STONY HEART AND HER BEAUTY;--HOW SET AND TERRIBLE HER LOOK IS NOW FOR ALL HER LOVELINESS OF FEATURE
I'VE A SINGING IN MY HEAD AND I CANNOT HEAR THEY PUT THE DOOR DOWN CAREFULLY UPON THE STONES AND ALL MIGHT SEE THE POOR DROWNED WRETCH--HIS GLASSY EYES ONE HALF-OPEN STARING RIGHT UPWARDS TO THE SKY
AND SELDOM I IMAGINE ANY CASES OF MORBID CONSCIENCE HE WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE VEXED AND FORGETTING HIS LATELY-CAUGHT TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS
LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE FOR THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED UP AS AT A TRUMPET-CALL TO EVERY WORD THAT MR BELL HAD SAID AND THOUGH HE KNEW THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID WOULD HENCEFORWARD BIND THE THOUGHT OF THE OLD OXFORD FELLOW CLOSELY UP WITH THE MOST PRECIOUS THINGS OF HIS HEART YET HE WOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO ANY EXPRESSION OF WHAT HE FELT TOWARDS MARGARET
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT AT THE DOOR--THEN HER FINGER ON HER LIPS SHE STOLE TO A SEAT ON THE SQUAB NEAR BESSY
SHE HELD HERSELF ALOOF FROM ME AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A QUEEN AND I HER HUMBLE UNWASHED VASSAL
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE UNLESS YOU SAY MORE
HE WENT UP TO DIFFERENT OBJECTS IN THE ROOM AS IF EXAMINING THEM BUT MARGARET SAW THAT IT WAS MERELY A NERVOUS TRICK--A WAY OF PUTTING OFF SOMETHING HE WISHED YET FEARED TO SAY
I HAVE SO WORKED AND PLANNED
I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL
IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN
HIS FINE FIGURE YET BORE HIM ABOVE THE COMMON HEIGHT OF MEN
AND FOR ONCE SHE SPOKE HARSHLY TO HER DAUGHTER
THERE WAS A GOOD BLAZING FIRE AND UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE
ABOUT THE WAGES SAID MR HALE
YOU CANNOT GIVE ME A GREATER PLEASURE THAN BY MAKING ME OF ANY USE
MR HALE CONTINUED
HE BENT EQUALLY LOW IN RETURN AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HER
BUT IF ANY OF THE OLD DISPUTES CAME UP AGAIN I WOULD CERTAINLY SPEAK OUT MY MIND NEXT HOT-POT DAY
I SAID LAST NIGHT I WOULD TAKE HER FOR HER OWN SAKE
I HAVE NOT SAID MARGARET REDDENING
SOON ENDS THE BITTER STRIFE AND THOU SHALT REIGN IN PEACE WITH CHRIST AT LENGTH KOSEGARTEN
BUT I AM SURE I COULD NEVER THINK OF YOU AS ANYTHING ELSE
WELL DID THE TALL STATELY GIRL OF EIGHTEEN REMEMBER THE TEARS SHED WITH SUCH WILD PASSION OF GRIEF BY THE LITTLE GIRL OF NINE AS SHE HID HER FACE UNDER THE BED-CLOTHES IN THAT FIRST NIGHT
HERE AT THIS BED OF THYME HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF WHAT SHE MUST NOT THINK OF NOW
BUT IT WAS ONE OF MRS THORNTON'S RIGOROUS LAWS OF HOSPITALITY THAT OF EACH SEPARATE DAINTY ENOUGH SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR ALL THE GUESTS TO PARTAKE IF THEY FELT INCLINED
OF COURSE WITHOUT ANY MATERNAL PARTIALITY I FORESAW THAT THE DEAR CHILD WAS LIKELY TO MARRY EARLY
HER OWN TIME FOR TALKING AND HEARING WOULD COME AT LAST AND SHE WAS TOO CERTAIN OF THIS TO FEEL IN A HURRY TO GRASP IT NOW
HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN SMOOTHING THE NAP OF HIS HAT WITH HIS COAT-SLEEVE FOR HALF A MINUTE OR SO
AND I'VE BEEN A TURN-OUT AND KNOWN WHAT IT WERE TO CLEM
HE WOULD NOT SURELY BREAK HIS WORD TO ME AND OH YES MAMMA HE DID
WAS HE BEWITCHED BY THOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES THAT SOFT HALF-OPEN SIGHING MOUTH WHICH LAY SO CLOSE UPON HIS SHOULDER ONLY YESTERDAY
STAND OUT O THE WAY WENCH OR I'LL MAKE YO HE HAD SHAKEN OFF MARY WITH VIOLENCE
WHEN THAT BEE FLEW FORTH WITH HIS SPOIL SHE WOULD BEGIN--THAT SHOULD BE THE SIGN
PLEASE MR BELL LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT IT--YOU COULD PERHAPS HELP ME A LITTLE
BUT UNLESS GOD SEND HIS HAIL OR BLINDING FIRE-BALLS SLEET OR STIFLING SNOW IN SOME TIME--HIS GOOD TIME--I SHALL ARRIVE
EACH VOLUME BROUGHT A REMEMBRANCE OR A SUGGESTION OF HIS DEAD FRIEND
I KNOW IT BY MYSELF
YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU COULD--YOU HAVE BEEN A COMFORT TO HER OH PAPA MUST HE GO SAID MARGARET PLEADING AGAINST HER OWN CONVICTION OF NECESSITY
IT'S LIKE TH GREAT BATTLE O ARMAGEDDON THE WAY THEY KEEP ON GRINNING AND FIGHTING AT EACH OTHER TILL EVEN WHILE THEY FIGHT THEY ARE PICKED OFF INTO THE PIT JUST THEN NICHOLAS HIGGINS CAME IN
HE FEARED BEING UPSET BY THE WORDS STILL MORE THE LOOKS OF SYMPATHISING NEIGHBOURS
HER EYELIDS QUIVERED HER LIPS COLOURED AND TREMBLED
SHE WAS GENTLE AND QUIET IN INTENSE BODILY SUFFERING ALMOST IN PROPORTION AS SHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS AND DEPRESSED WHEN THERE HAD BEEN NO REAL CAUSE FOR GRIEF
AND THEN LUCKILY I CAUGHT FATHER GRADY AND I'VE ASKED HIM IN TO SPEAK TO THEM AND DISSUADE THEM FROM GOING OFF IN A BODY
BUT FATHER HE WAS THERE BY THEM AS SHE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN MORE
I CAN'T THINK SHE WENT ON PETTISHLY HOW MY AUNT ALLOWED HER TO GET INTO SUCH RAMBLING HABITS IN MILTON
HE KNELT BY HER SIDE TO BRING HIS FACE TO A LEVEL WITH HER EAR
THE PROCEEDINGS THEY HAD BEGUN TO TALK ABOUT ON THE INQUEST WERE STOPPED
WE WOULD WORK UP THE CLASSICS FAMOUSLY
NOT A TENDER FRIEND
HER MOTHER SEEMED MORE THAN USUALLY FEEBLE
I DID HOPE YOU HAD HAD NOBLENESS ENOUGH IN YOU TO MAKE YOU PAY HER THE HOMAGE OF THE HEART
IF YOU HAD BUT NEVER GOT THIS FANCY INTO YOUR HEAD
HE MIGHT DESPISE HER BUT THE WOMAN WHOM HE HAD ONCE LOVED SHOULD BE KEPT FROM SHAME
THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON I DON'T WANT TO FORM ANY FRIENDSHIP WITH MISS HALE MAMMA SAID FANNY POUTING
I WISH I HAD GONE INTO SOME COUNTRY PLACE IN WALES
FEW EVEN WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR STRONG AFFECTIONS
SHE KNEW THAT HIS VERY RESERVE HAD ORIGINATED IN A TENDERNESS FOR HER WHICH MIGHT BE COWARDLY BUT WAS NOT UNFEELING
MRS THORNTON WAS REVIEWING ALL THE PROBABLE CASES IN WHICH SHE HAD PLEDGED HERSELF TO ACT
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SPEAK O TH UNION
THOUGH I BELIEVE--IN FACT I KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE REJECTED YOU STILL TO HAVE LOVED HER WITHOUT RETURN WOULD HAVE LIFTED YOU HIGHER THAN ALL THOSE BE THEY WHO THEY MAY THAT HAVE NEVER KNOWN HER TO LOVE
AT LAST SHE SMILED
AMONG OTHER HOPES THAT HAD VANISHED WAS THE HOPE THE TRUST SHE HAD HAD THAT MR BELL WOULD HAVE GIVEN MR THORNTON THE SIMPLE FACTS OF THE FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAD PRECEDED THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT THAT LED TO LEONARDS DEATH
I DOUBT IF THERE HAS BEEN A CHIMNEY IN MILTON INFORMED AGAINST FOR FIVE YEARS PAST ALTHOUGH SOME ARE CONSTANTLY SENDING OUT ONE-THIRD OF THEIR COAL IN WHAT IS CALLED HERE UNPARLIAMENTARY SMOKE I ONLY KNOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE MUSLIN BLINDS CLEAN HERE ABOVE A WEEK TOGETHER
BUT THIS IS PAPA'S STUDY AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO A CHAIR TO REST YOURSELF FOR A FEW MINUTES
SHE DIED THIS MORNING AND HER SISTER IS HERE--COME TO BEG A STRANGE THING
MARGARET SAW IN HER FATHER'S NERVOUS WAYS THAT THE FIRST IMPRESSION OF POSSIBLE DANGER WAS MADE UPON HIS MIND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS MAKING LIGHT OF WHAT SHE TOLD HIM
AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
YOU MUST NOT GIVE WAY OR WHERE SHALL WE ALL BE
IT WAS WRITTEN BY A MR OLDFIELD MINISTER OF CARSINGTON IN DERBYSHIRE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY YEARS AGO OR MORE
OF ASSUMING CREDIT FOR WEALTH AND RESOURCES NOT POSSESSED IN THE OTHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PIECE THE DOOR HALF-OPENED AND EDITH SAW CAPTAIN LENNOX HESITATING WHETHER TO COME IN
NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL-BOUND LITTLE-READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK-SHELVES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
SHE--AS ILL AS SHE CAN BE SHE IS
I AM NOT FIT FOR HER MOTHER
BUT HOO'LL THINK BETTER ON IT AND COME
NOT A QUESTION DID SHE ASK
HE WAS CONTINUALLY GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON LABORIOUS TIPTOE TO SEE IF HIS WIFE WAS STILL ASLEEP
OR ELSE I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE VERY PRETTY SYMPTOMS ABOUT HER THEN I AM SURE YOU ARE WRONG SAID MR HALE
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM IF I WERE YOU REPLIED MARGARET QUIETLY
I HAVE GOOD REASON TO KNOW THAT SHE IS IN SOME STRAIT ARISING OUT OF SOME ATTACHMENT
THE WORKMAN WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AFTER THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE
HE'S WORTH FIGHTING WI IS JOHN THORNTON
I MAY COME AND SEE YO DRESSED FOR THORNTON'S I RECKON
THEY WERE CONSEQUENTLY SURPRISED AND INDIGNANT AT THE POOR IRISH WHO HAD ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE IMPORTED AND BROUGHT OVER TO TAKE THEIR PLACES
WHO IS GONE
HE'S GOING OUT TO DRINK AGAIN
WE CAN ONLY DELAY ITS PROGRESS--ALLEVIATE THE PAIN IT CAUSES
HOW DID SHE GET HURT
IT HAD RETURNED INTO ITS NORMAL STATE OF BAG AND COVERING
WE ALL FEEL THE SANCTITY OF OUR SEX AS A HIGH PRIVILEGE WHEN WE SEE DANGER
BUT DOESN'T IT FALL OUT WELL THAT IF MY UNCLE WAS TO DIE IT SHOULD BE JUST NOW WHEN WE ARE COME HOME AND SETTLED IN THE OLD HOUSE AND QUITE READY TO RECEIVE MARGARET
HE COULDN'T LOOK AT ME AND DOUBT ME BUT I WERE NOT TO BE CAUGHT WITH SUCH CHAFF FROM SUCH A FELLOW AS HIM AND SO I TOLD HIM
YES MOTHER
ON SOME SUCH NIGHT AS THIS SHE REMEMBERED PROMISING TO HERSELF TO LIVE AS BRAVE AND NOBLE A LIFE AS ANY HEROINE SHE EVER READ OR HEARD OF IN ROMANCE A LIFE SANS PEUR ET SANS REPROCHE
IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
SHE SIMPLY BOWED HER FAREWELL
THEY WERE A LITTLE INCLINED TO REBEL AGAINST ARISTIDES BEING ALWAYS CALLED THE JUST
IT HAD RESERVATIONS IN IT WHICH SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AH THOUGHT MARGARET THAT IS WHAT I HAVE MISSED
BUT THE AFFECTION WAS CHARMING TO MARGARET'S OWN AFFECTIONATE NATURE
IT STOPPED WHEN THEY STOPPED LOOKING OUT ALONG THE LINE AND HEARING THE WHIZZ OF THE COMING TRAIN
BUT NEVER MIND NEVER MIND
YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY FATHER
HE HAD BEEN TO MILTON ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH HER PROPERTY ON HIS RETURN FROM SCOTLAND
SHE BLUSHED WHEN DIXON THROWING THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR OPEN MADE AN APPEAL FOR ADMIRATION
WHY MAMMA I COULD ASTONISH YOU WITH A GREAT MANY WORDS YOU NEVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE
A SERIES OF VISIONS PASSING BEFORE HER IN ALL OF WHICH HER SON WAS THE PRINCIPAL THE SOLE OBJECT,--HER SON HER PRIDE HER PROPERTY
WHY HE'D CORRUPT A SAINT
FOR JUST NOW SHE COULD NOT BEAR MUCH MORE
BUT SUDDENLY THIS SIMPLE EMOTION OF PLEASURE WAS TAINTED POISONED BY JEALOUSY
HER FATHER TOO WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT HIS COMPANION WAS SAYING
BUT THE YOUNG LADY DENIES THAT SHE WAS THERE AT THE TIME MISS HALE DENIES SHE WAS THERE REPEATED MR THORNTON IN AN ALTERED VOICE
AND SHE HAD GROWN UP WITH THE INCONSEQUENCE SO SHE DID NOT PERCEIVE IT
IT WILL MAKE ME HAPPIER INDEED AND SHE WENT UP TO HIM TO KISS HIM
OH IF HE'D A NOTION I WAS WITHIN TWENTY MILES OF HIM HE'D FERRET ME OUT TO PAY OFF OLD GRUDGES
IT TURNED HER SICK TO THINK OF IT
HER LIPS MOVING SO SLIGHTLY AS SHE SPOKE NOT BREAKING THE COLD SERENE LOOK OF HER FACE WITH ANY VARIATION FROM THE ONE LOVELY HAUGHTY CURVE
HERE EVERY VAN EVERY WAGGON AND TRUCK BORE COTTON EITHER IN THE RAW SHAPE IN BAGS OR THE WOVEN SHAPE IN BALES OF CALICO
AND WHEN HE CAME IN THERE WERE HIS OWN BOOKS TO PACK UP WHICH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF COULD DO TO HIS SATISFACTION
YOU SEE YOUR MOTHER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT YET
DON'T SIT UP FOR ME MOTHER YOU EXPECT ME TO GO TO BED BEFORE I HAVE SEEN YOU SAFE DO YOU WELL PERHAPS NOT HE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT
WE MAY IGNORE OUR OWN DEPENDENCE OR REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OTHERS DEPEND UPON US IN MORE RESPECTS THAN THE PAYMENT OF WEEKLY WAGES
AND WHEN RELEASED HE TOTTERED TOWARDS HER MURMURING PRAY FOR ME MARGARET
FOR MR HALE HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MANY
HE RATHER WANTED A STRIKE
MRS HALE BEGAN TO SPEAK
HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION
IT WOULD BE INFINITELY WORSE TO HAVE KNOWN YOU A HYPOCRITE SHE DROPPED HER VOICE AT THE LAST FEW WORDS AS IF ENTERTAINING THE IDEA OF HYPOCRISY FOR A MOMENT IN CONNECTION WITH HER FATHER SAVOURED OF IRREVERENCE
FOR A FRIEND'S POSITION WAS WHAT SHE FOUND THAT HE HAD HELD IN HER REGARD AS WELL AS IN THAT OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY
I HARDLY DARE TELL YOU HOW MUCH I SHALL LIKE THIS SKETCH HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER SHE HEARD THIS LATTER SENTENCE BEFORE SHE WENT TO THE BROOK TO WASH HER PALETTE
LISTEN YOUNG LADY THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND IF YOU CAN WHAT SORT OF A MAN YOU REJECTED
THEY DON'T CARE TO MEET TO TALK OVER THOUGHTS AND SPECULATIONS EVEN OF THE WEAKEST WILDEST KIND AFTER THEIR WORK IS DONE
ALL NIGHT LONG TOO THERE BURNT A LITTLE LIGHT ON EARTH
DR DONALDSON IS HERE
THIS HE GAVE TO ONE OF THE CLERKS SAYING I APPOINTED WATSON--HE WHO WAS A PACKER IN THE WAREHOUSE AND WHO WENT INTO THE POLICE--TO CALL ON ME AT FOUR O'CLOCK
I DON'T SET UP MILTON AS A MODEL OF A TOWN NOT IN ARCHITECTURE SLYLY ASKED MR BELL
AND I THINK IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO THE WORKMAN ANY GOOD
HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF
WHY I DON'T KNOW--I SUPPOSE BECAUSE ON THE VERY FACE OF IT I SEE TWO CLASSES DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY YET EACH EVIDENTLY REGARDING THE INTERESTS OF THE OTHER AS OPPOSED TO THEIR OWN
HOW DID YOU COME
THE WEATHER WAS PIERCING COLD AS IT HAD BEEN FOR WEEKS
AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK MR HALE IMAGINED THAT HE SAW TRACES OF TEARS ON HER CHEEKS
THAT WAS HER FIRST FEELING AFTER READING EDITH'S LETTER
OH HERE IS TEA AT LAST EXCLAIMED SHE AS IF RELIEVED
WITH JOHN
HE HAD OFTEN SPOKEN TO MARGARET OF THESE HASTY WALKS SNATCHED IN THE INTERVALS BETWEEN STUDY AND DINNER
JUST HER OLD SMILE
OR STOP STILL AND MEDITATE LIKE THE HAMLET YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO IF I GO TOO FAST THANK YOU
FRESH AND YOUNG IN WARMTH AND KINDNESS I MEAN
THERE EVERYBODY WOULD REMEMBER HIM AND IF THERE WAS A STRANGER KNOWN TO BE IN THE HOUSE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO GUESS IT WAS FREDERICK
AND THE OVERLOADING SUCH A HOUSE WITH COLOUR AND SUCH HEAVY CORNICES NEVER MIND PAPA
BUT AFTER WIPING HER EYES AND STEADYING HER VOICE SHE MANAGED TO TELL MR BELL THAT MRS LENNOX WAS TOO NEAR HER CONFINEMENT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE ANY JOURNEY AT PRESENT
I SUPPOSE THE INQUIRY NEVER CAME TO ANYTHING NO
AND AT ANY RATE BESSY'S ILLNESS IS CONSUMPTION--SHE WON'T WANT WINE
AND THE GREAT INTEREST OF THE LAST DAY OR SO BOUCHER'S SUICIDE HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK WITH MORE EAGERNESS THAN EVER UPON HIS SPECULATIONS
THAT SHE WOULD PULL THROUGH MARGARET FELT AS IF SHE HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTING HERSELF WITH THE SURROUNDINGS OF DEATH WHICH HE THE FATHER HAD ONLY JUST LEARNT
IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND EVER COME TO TOWN MY SON AND DAUGHTER CAPTAIN AND MRS LENNOX WILL I AM SURE JOIN WITH ME IN WISHING TO DO ANYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SHOW YOU ATTENTION MRS THORNTON THOUGHT IN HER OWN MIND THAT MARGARET HAD NOT TAKEN MUCH CARE TO ENLIGHTEN HER AUNT AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MR AND MRS THORNTON TOWARDS WHOM THE FINE-LADY AUNT WAS EXTENDING HER SOFT PATRONAGE
MOTHER SAID HE HURRIEDLY I CANNOT HEAR A WORD AGAINST HER
HAS BEEN CALLED UPON TO EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND SELF-CONTROL
EVEN WITH HIS OWN ACCUSTOMED AND SKILLED WORKPEOPLE HE WOULD HAVE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FULFILLING HIS ENGAGEMENTS
BUT FREDERICK WAS COME
BUT BY-AND-BY WE SHALL MEET WITH PLENTY OF STUMBLING-BLOCKS NO DOUBT CHAPTER XLIII MARGARET'S FLITTIN THE MEANEST THING TO WHICH WE BID ADIEU LOSES ITS MEANNESS IN THE PARTING HOUR ELLIOTT
BUT NOW YOU GO OUT MISS
IT WILL BE LATE FOR MRS HALE
AND WHY SHOULD HE STAB HER WITH HER SHAME IN THIS WAY
IT WAS TRUE THAT DIXON IN HER BUSINESS-LETTERS QUOTED EVERY NOW AND THEN AN OPINION OF MR THORNTON'S AS TO WHAT SHE HAD BETTER DO ABOUT THE FURNITURE OR HOW ACT IN REGARD TO THE LANDLORD OF THE CRAMPTON TERRACE HOUSE
HE CAN DO IT BY THY SILENCE AS WELL AS BY THY PREACHING
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT--THEY WHO HAVEN'T THE SENSE TO SEE THAT IF WE DON'T GET A FAIR SHARE OF THE PROFITS TO COMPENSATE US FOR OUR WEAR AND TEAR HERE IN ENGLAND WE CAN MOVE OFF TO SOME OTHER COUNTRY
WHAT RIGHT HE STOPPED SHORT IN HIS VEHEMENT QUESTION
THE LATTER SAID IN A LOW TONE
BUT IT IS A COMMON EFFECT OF SUCH A ROOM AS THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE SPEAK LOW AS IF UNWILLING TO AWAKEN THE UNUSED ECHOES
THE POWER OF THE MACHINERY OF MILTON THE POWER OF THE MEN OF MILTON IMPRESSED HIM WITH A SENSE OF GRANDEUR WHICH HE YIELDED TO WITHOUT CARING TO INQUIRE INTO THE DETAILS OF ITS EXERCISE
A WEEK AFTERWARDS SHE CAME PRANCING TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND MADE HIM A LOW CURTSEY
YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE IT FOR THEM
FANCY LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF FACTORIES AND FACTORY PEOPLE
IT IS NOT A MONTH SINCE THE BISHOP OFFERED ME ANOTHER LIVING
SHE HEARD IT IN HIS GRAVE AND TREMULOUS VOICE
HE SAT DOWN A BIT AND PUT HIS HAND AFORE HIS EYES
IT WAS ONLY TO ASK EDITH IF SHE WOULD TELL NEWTON TO BRING DOWN HER SHAWLS
AND SECONDLY SHE DID NOT KNOW IF HER FATHER MIGHT NOT BE DISPLEASED THAT SHE HAD TAKEN UPON HERSELF TO DECLINE MR LENNOX'S PROPOSAL
I AM SORRY I ASKED YOU TO GO TO MR THORNTON'S
I TELL YOU MRS SHAW SHALL COME
I'M SURE YOU'LL JOIN US IN FAMILY PRAYER HIGGINS LOOKED AT MARGARET DOUBTFULLY
I DID NOT KNOW I WAS WHY BECAUSE I MADE AN UNLUCKY REMARK YOU WILL NEITHER TELL ME WHAT HELSTONE IS LIKE NOR WILL YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR HOME THOUGH I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT BOTH THE LATTER ESPECIALLY BUT INDEED I CANNOT TELL YOU ABOUT MY OWN HOME
I'M SURE MRS THORNTON WOULD LEND IT TO US DR DONALDSON'S EXPERIENCE TOLD THEM RIGHTLY
AND SHE WENT FOLLOWED BY THE OTHERS
SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE CAUGHT AT THE SKIRTS OF THAT DEPARTING TIME AND PRAYED IT TO RETURN AND GIVE HER BACK WHAT SHE HAD TOO LITTLE VALUED WHILE IT WAS YET IN HER POSSESSION
NOT A WORD SHE REPLIED GRAVELY
IT WAS NOT LIKE THE SAME PLACE
AND I KNOW DIXON DID NOT LIKE CHANGING FROM LADY'S MAID TO NURSE AND I WAS AFRAID THAT IF I TOOK HER NEAR HER OLD HOME AND AMONGST HER OWN PEOPLE SHE MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE ME
BUT I WILL GO AGAIN AND SEE THE MAN HIMSELF SAID MR HALE
AND HOW DID FRED GET OFF OH
HOW FAITHLESS SHE HAD BEEN
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE SHE'D FIND A BETTER IF THESE WORDS HURT HER SON THE DUSKY LIGHT PREVENTED HIM FROM BETRAYING ANY EMOTION
FATHER FATHER SAID I
BUT THE ONLY TIME I SAW HIM IT WAS NOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS HE SPOKE OF BUT THOSE OF HIS SICK WIFE--HIS LITTLE CHILDREN TRUE
AND READ US TO SLEEP IN THE EVENINGS
HERE WAS SHE CLASSING HIS LOW OPINION OF HER ALONGSIDE WITH THE DISPLEASURE OF GOD
BUT I WISH SHE COULD HA LIVED WI YO FOR ALL THAT BUT EVEN THOUGH SHE MAY NOT BE EXACTLY FITTED TO COME AND LIVE WITH US AS A SERVANT--AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT--I WILL ALWAYS TRY AND BE A FRIEND TO HER FOR YOUR SAKE BESSY
MR HALE WITH FEWER WORDS EXPRESSED A DEEPER GRATITUDE
YOU HAVE NOT TRIED US YET MR THORNTON LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT THIS
THE GIRLS WITH THEIR ROUGH BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY FREEDOM WOULD COMMENT ON HER DRESS EVEN TOUCH HER SHAWL OR GOWN TO ASCERTAIN THE EXACT MATERIAL
I HAD HAD THE FEVER AND WAS BUT DELICATE
AND HERE WILL I BE BURIED AND LOST IN THE CROWD I DON'T GIVE UP MY PLAN YET
IN SPIRIT THEN OUR BLISS WE FOUND IN SPIRIT YET TO THEM I'M BOUND UHLAND
THESE BOOKS DIXON I WILL KEEP
THE TRAIN IS HERE
WELLY CLEMMED TO DEATH
BUT MR BELL'S SCOUTED IDEA RECURRED TO HIM AND THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HIS MOUTH BEFORE HE WELL KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR LIST REJECTING EACH AS THEY VISITED IT
CHAPTER XIV THE MUTINY I WAS USED TO SLEEP AT NIGHTS AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD NOW IF THE WIND BLEW ROUGH IT MADE ME START AND THINK OF MY POOR BOY TOSSING ABOUT UPON THE ROARING SEAS
HE HOPED THEY WOULD SEE THE TROOPS AND BE QUELLED BY THE THOUGHT OF THEIR NARROW ESCAPE
FOR ALL HIS PAIN HE LONGED TO SEE THE AUTHOR OF IT
HE WENT ON
HE LOOKED WISTFULLY AT MARGARET
SHE FELT NO AWKWARDNESS
WELL JOHN HE KNEW WHAT THAT LITTLE SPEECH MEANT
BUT NOW I HATE HER FOR YOUR MISERY'S SAKE
TO HAVRE
THINK OF THAT FIRST STRIKE WHEN MOTHER DIED--HOW WE ALL HAD TO CLEM--YOU THE WORST OF ALL
IT WERE ONLY FOR TO HUMOUR THE MEASTER I LET ON AS IF I THOUGHT YO'D MAPPEN LEAVE MILTON WITHOUT SEEING ME YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGARET
NO NO
PAPA--DID YOU SEE NICHOLAS HIGGINS AT THE FUNERAL
IT IS A WELL-LIGHTED ROAD ALL THE WAY HOME IF IT SHOULD BE DARK
BUT MY LAST WORDS ARE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMISE OF KINDNESS TO MY CHILD NOT KINDNESS TESTIFIED MRS THORNTON UNGRACIOUSLY TRUTHFUL TO THE LAST
YESTERDAY WAS SO SULTRY EVERY ONE FELT ILL
I AM QUITE WELL
AND STILL HE NEVER MOVED NOR TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HER FOND EMBRACE
SUCH AS BOUCHER--'TWOULD BE SETTIN HIM UP TOO MUCH TO LIKEN HIM TO A DAISY
SHE WAS VERY MUCH INCLINED TO PLAY SOME PRANKS WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED UP AT SUCH AN UNUSUAL HOUR
MARGARET WAS MORE LIKE HIM THAN LIKE HER MOTHER
BUT HE HAD NEVER WANTED HER TO PAY FOR HER BOARD
GOD WAS THERE CLOSE AROUND THEM HEARING HER FATHER'S WHISPERED WORDS
IF I HAD ANY PREJUDICES THE GIFT OF SUCH DELICIOUS FRUIT AS THIS WOULD MELT THEM ALL AWAY
HER FATHER TOOK HER THROUGH THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOTEL AND LEAVING HER AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE WENT TO THE ADDRESS OF THE LANDLORD OF THE HOUSE THEY HAD FIXED UPON
SHE WAS ILL AT EASE AND LOOKED MORE THAN USUALLY STERN AND FORBIDDING AS SHE ENTERED THE HALES LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM
AND I'D RATHER THINK YO A FOOL THAN A KNAVE
HESTON ITSELF WAS ONE LONG STRAGGLING STREET RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE SEASHORE
I'LL SPEAK TRUTH
THEY WERE TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HIM--TO MAKE HIM FLINCH
THE NEXT AFTERNOON DR DONALDSON CAME TO PAY HIS FIRST VISIT TO MRS HALE
FULL OF WONDER WHEN MR LENNOX WOULD GO AND ALLOW HER TO RELAX INTO THOUGHT ON THE EVENTS OF THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR
SO AFTER CLEARING HER THROAT AS IF TO SHOW HER WILLINGNESS TO DO AWAY WITH DIFFICULTIES SHE ASKED MISS HALE WHETHER SHE THOUGHT IF SHE TOOK CARE NEVER TO SEE A PRIEST OR ENTER INTO ONE OF THEIR CHURCHES THERE WOULD BE SO VERY MUCH DANGER OF HER BEING CONVERTED
I'D BE THANKFUL IF I WAS FREE TO DO THAT
AND SHAME IT WOULD BE TO PLEDGE HERSELF TO A LIE IN A PUBLIC COURT OR OTHERWISE TO STAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE HER REASON FOR DESIRING DARKNESS RATHER THAN LIGHT
AND HIS TIPSY WORDS HAD NOT BEEN ATTENDED TO BY THE BUSY WAITERS THERE
SHE WAS SURE SHE HEARD A MOAN
IF HER LIFE HAS BEEN WHAT YOU SAY AT ANY RATE SHE DID NOT FEAR DEATH AS SOME DO
WHAT AN ICY ROOM SHE SAID
IT IS ALL RIGHT SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING AT DIXON
I SHALL PUT MYSELF AT HER FEET--I MUST
NOT ONE WORD
DID YOU EVER TELL HIM THE STRONG INSTINCTIVE MOTIVE THE INSTINCTIVE WANT OF FAITH AND CLUTCHING AT A SIN TO KEEP MYSELF FROM SINKING SAID SHE BITTERLY
HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
HOW SAID SHE TURNING HER LARGE SOFT EYES ROUND FULL UPON HIM
THOSE GRAVE SOFT EYES OF HERS WERE DIFFICULT TO RESIST
BUT NOT NOW
IT WAS REPORTED THAT HE HAD A CHILD BUT NO ONE KNEW OF IT FOR CERTAIN
WHAT DOES YOUR MOTHER SAY
OH I AM SO THANKFUL THEY ARE GONE AND SHE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT
BUT EVEN HERE MARGARET'S DISSATISFACTION FOUND HER OUT
THAT WHATEVER HER FAULTS OF DISCONTENT AND REPINING MIGHT HAVE BEEN IT WAS AN ERROR IN HER FATHER TO HAVE LEFT HER TO LEARN HIS CHANGE OF OPINION AND HIS APPROACHING CHANGE OF LIFE FROM HER BETTER-INFORMED CHILD
THE TONES OF THEIR UNRESTRAINED VOICES AND THEIR CARELESSNESS OF ALL COMMON RULES OF STREET POLITENESS FRIGHTENED MARGARET A LITTLE AT FIRST
I LEFT THEM COWERED UP IN A SMALL ROOM AT THE HEAD OF A BACK FLIGHT OF STAIRS
MRS HALE WAS CURIOUSLY AMUSED AND INTERESTED BY THE IDEA OF THE THORNTON DINNER PARTY
SHE LAY ON THE SOFA WITH HER EYES SHUT NEVER SPEAKING BUT WHEN SPOKEN TO AND THEN REPLYING IN WHISPERS
MAMMA AND I WANT TO ASK YOU SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT EDITH
HE CANNOT BE A GENTLEMAN--IS HE I AM NOT QUITE THE PERSON TO DECIDE ON ANOTHER'S GENTLEMANLINESS MISS HALE
I COULD HARDLY LIFT MYSELF UP TO GO AND MEET HIM--EVERYTHING SEEMED SO TO REEL AROUND ME ALL AT ONCE
SHE DID NOT GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM AS SHE HAD DONE IN FORMER DAYS WHEN HIS ABRUPTNESS OR HIS TEMPER HAD ANNOYED HER
HE HAS LOVED YOUR FATHER FOR FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS
THEN ALL THE LATENT VASHTI IN MARGARET WAS ROUSED AND SHE COULD HARDLY KEEP HERSELF FROM EXPRESSING HER FEELINGS
THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS
HIS MILTON PROPERTY REQUIRED SOME LOOKING AFTER AND HIS AGENT HAD WRITTEN TO HIM TO SAY THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
AND SHE GLANCED UP AT JANE AS IF SHRINKING FROM HER INSPECTION MORE THAN FROM THE DOCTOR'S
A DRUNKEN INFIDEL WEAVER SAID MR HALE TO HIMSELF IN DISMAY
ONLY YOU'RE RIGHT IN SAYING SHE'S TOO GOOD AN OPINION OF HERSELF TO THINK OF YOU
NICHOLAS SAID MARGARET AGAIN
HE HAD GONE AWAY TO SOME LECTURE OR SOME CLUB OR SOME BEER-SHOP ACCORDING TO HIS DEGREE OF CHARACTER
DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE HE MURMURED
JOHN ALWAYS SPEAKS AS IF I FANCIED I WAS ILL AND I AM SURE I NEVER DO FANCY ANY SUCH THING
THAT THE STRAIN WAS PAST
MARGARET CARRIED THEM BACK TO HER MOTHER WHO UNTIED THE SILKEN STRING WITH TREMBLING FINGERS AND EXAMINING THEIR DATES SHE GAVE THEM TO MARGARET TO READ MAKING HER HURRIED ANXIOUS REMARKS ON THEIR CONTENTS ALMOST BEFORE HER DAUGHTER COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WERE
NOW I DON'T LIKE TELLING YOU WHAT I WANTED BECAUSE YOU'VE FRETTING ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH AND I KNOW YOU'LL FRET ABOUT THIS
MR BELL SLEPT SOUNDLY AFTER HIS UNUSUAL EXERCISE THROUGH THE DAY
SHE WAS NOT SURE OF THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS SHE HAD PROVOKED
PACK IT UP I SAY
AND THEN PUTTING HIS HAND ON MARGARET'S ARM HE MUTELY ENTREATED TO BE LED AWAY AS IF HE WERE BLIND AND SHE HIS FAITHFUL GUIDE
HE WAS LOOKING AWAY
BUT I--I MADE A PROMISE TO MRS HALE THAT I WOULD NOT ALLOW HER DAUGHTER TO GO WRONG WITHOUT ADVISING AND REMONSTRATING WITH HER
HE DREADED LEST HE SHOULD GO FORWARDS TO MEET HER WITH HIS ARMS HELD OUT IN MUTE ENTREATY THAT SHE WOULD COME AND NESTLE THERE AS SHE HAD DONE ALL UNHEEDED THE DAY BEFORE BUT NEVER UNHEEDED AGAIN
MARGARET MISSED THEM EACH AND ALL AND GRIEVED OVER THEM LIKE OLD FRIENDS
DIXON MUST KEEP STERN GUARD ON THE FRONT DOOR ONLY ADMITTING THE FEW VISITORS THAT EVER CAME TO THE HOUSE INTO MR HALE'S ROOM DOWN-STAIRS--MRS HALE'S EXTREME ILLNESS GIVING HER A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THIS
MR BELL'S KINDLY SOPHISTRY THAT NEARLY ALL MEN WERE GUILTY OF EQUIVOCAL ACTIONS AND THAT THE MOTIVE ENNOBLED THE EVIL HAD NEVER HAD MUCH REAL WEIGHT WITH HER
LUCKILY MR THORNTON FOUND A TENANT FOR IT
SHE WAS SURPRISED TO THINK HOW MUCH SHE ENJOYED THIS DINNER
AND WHAT'S MORE I THANK YO
ALONE SHE WOULD GO BEFORE GOD AND CRY FOR HIS ABSOLUTION
YOU MUST KEEP AS MUCH OF YOUR DARNING AS YOU CAN TILL THEN
I'VE BEEN A JOURNEY TO-DAY AND JOURNEYS BEGIN TO TELL UPON MY SIXTY AND ODD YEARS I BELIEVE I SHALL STAY AND SEE MY BROTHER AND SISTER SAID MR LENNOX MAKING NO MOVEMENT OF DEPARTURE
AND THEN MADE FOR TH DOOR
THINK NO MORE OF IT NICHOLAS I BEG
I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT HEAVEN MUST BE--AND OH
BUT SHE MAY NEED HELP AND WOMANLY COUNSEL;--THERE MAY BE DIFFICULTIES OR TEMPTATIONS WHICH I DON'T KNOW
BUT THE IDEA OF PEARS HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF MR HALE'S MIND AND WAS NOT TO BE GOT RID OF
IT HAD BEEN A ROYAL TIME OF LUXURY TO HIM WITH ALL ITS STINGS AND CONTUMELIES COMPARED TO THE POVERTY THAT CREPT ROUND AND CLIPPED THE ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE DOWN TO SORDID FACT AND LIFE WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE OF EITHER HOPE OR FEAR
CHAPTER XXXIV FALSE AND TRUE TRUTH WILL FAIL THEE NEVER NEVER
DEAR SIR,--THE ACCOMPANYING BOOK I AM SURE WILL BE VALUED BY YOU FOR THE SAKE OF MY FATHER TO WHOM IT BELONGED
HE ALMOST SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT LIKE HER BEFORE THEIR CONVERSATION ENDED
HE CAN'T BEAR TO HEAR FRED SPOKEN OF I LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT HIM MAMMA
WHILE THEY WERE GIVING WAY TO GRIEF SHE MUST BE WORKING PLANNING CONSIDERING
AND I KNOW OF OLD YOU CAN GIVE US COMFORTABLE ROOMS AND A CAPITAL DINNER
MARGARET'S QUICKLY-ADJUSTED SPIRIT-LAMP WAS THE MOST EFFICACIOUS CONTRIVANCE THOUGH NOT SO LIKE THE GYPSY-ENCAMPMENT WHICH EDITH IN SOME OF HER MOODS CHOSE TO CONSIDER THE NEAREST RESEMBLANCE TO A BARRACK-LIFE
I CAN PRESERVE MYSELF FROM PRIESTS AND FROM CHURCHES
AT HELSTONE THERE HAD BEEN PERPETUAL OCCASIONS FOR AN INTERCHANGE OF VISITS WITH NEIGHBOURING CLERGYMEN
THAT AFTERNOON SHE WALKED SWIFTLY TO THE HIGGINS'S HOUSE
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY TALKING OF THE TURN-OUT AND SUGGESTING WHAT COURSE HAD BEST BE PURSUED
WRITE BY THIS VERY NEXT POST
THE WRENCH OF IRON
THEN MARGARET WAS ALMOST TOUCHED INTO TEARS BY THE ALLUSIONS WHICH HE OFTEN MADE TO THEIR CHILDISH DAYS IN THE NEW FOREST
IT WAS ABOUT TWO MILES FROM THEIR HOUSE IN CRAMPTON CRESCENT TO MARLBOROUGH STREET
WHY ARE WE TO HAVE LESS WAGE NOW I ASK THAN TWO YEAR AGO DON'T ASK ME SAID MARGARET
I KEPT MYSELF UP WITH PROVERBS AS LONG AS I COULD
THERE WOULD BE NO DEMAND FOR LIGHT SUMMER GOODS THIS YEAR
SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS
PRAY DON'T SCRUPLE THOUGH HE IS MY FRIEND THERE
A LITTLE PLAY WITH SHOLTO AS HE RETURNED FROM HIS MORNING'S WALK
MARGARET SAT DOWN ON THE RUG PARTLY TO WARM HERSELF FOR THE DAMPNESS OF THE EVENING HUNG ABOUT HER DRESS AND OVER-FATIGUE HAD MADE HER CHILLY
SOME SAILORS BEING ALOFT IN THE MAIN-TOPSAIL RIGGING THE CAPTAIN HAD ORDERED THEM TO RACE DOWN THREATENING THE HINDMOST WITH THE CAT-OF-NINE-TAILS
WHICH IS FULL OF DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST BE ENCOUNTERED
YOU ARE TO BRING BACK MARGARET EDITH RE-ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND THEN HE REMEMBERED THE LIE SHE HAD TOLD AND ALL THAT WAS FOREGONE
SHE READ IT IN BOUCHER'S FACE FORLORNLY DESPERATE AND LIVID WITH RAGE
AND I REMEMBER MR HALE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HE WOULD COME DOWN
THERE WAS ANOTHER CHILD I BELIEVE A GIRL
IT IS OR OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO HAVE ONE GREAT DESIRE AND TO BRING ALL THE PURPOSES OF HIS LIFE TO BEAR ON THE FULFILMENT OF THAT AND THAT IS ASKED MR HALE
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
THE LIMITS BY WHICH THIS RULE OF HER AUNT'S HAD CIRCUMSCRIBED MARGARET'S INDEPENDENCE HAD BEEN SILENTLY REBELLED AGAINST AT THE TIME
NOW AND THEN A COTTAGE DOOR IN THE DISTANCE WAS OPENED AND SHUT AS IF TO ADMIT THE TIRED LABOURER TO HIS HOME
MRS THORNTON GAVE MR BELL HER FORMAL HOSPITABLE WELCOME
OH FREDERICK
OH FREDERICK
BUT WE ARE BIDDEN BY PARLIAMENT TO BURN OUR OWN SMOKE
HE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD SEEMED SO CLEAR NOT HALF-AN-HOUR BEFORE AS IT CAME OUT OF MR THORNTON'S LIPS
WE FEEL IT SO JUST NOW AT ANY RATE
IS IT VERY LATE CONTINUED SHE LIFTING HERSELF LANGUIDLY OFF THE BED YET LETTING HER FEET TOUCH THE GROUND WITHOUT FAIRLY STANDING DOWN AS SHE SHADED HER WET RUFFLED HAIR OFF HER FACE AND TRIED TO LOOK AS THOUGH NOTHING WERE THE MATTER
THAT IS SETTLED
I HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT PROPERTY BUT MY INTENTION IN SETTLING IN MILTON WAS TO BECOME A PRIVATE TUTOR TO TEACH FOLK
BUT WHEN FATHER SAID HE'D GIVE HIM UP TO POLICE HE GAVE A GREAT CRY AND STRUCK FATHER ON TH FACE WI HIS CLOSED FIST AND BE OFF LIKE LIGHTNING
NEVER FOR YOUR BIDDING EXCLAIMED MR THORNTON
WHAT HAS HE TO DO WITH IT HE IS MISS HALE'S TENANT SAID MR LENNOX TURNING AWAY
WAS IT ANGER
I APPEAL TO YOU
BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME--SOLEMN NIGHT AND ALL THE HOUSE WAS QUIET MARGARET STILL SATE WATCHING THE BEAUTY OF A LONDON SKY AT SUCH AN HOUR ON SUCH A SUMMER EVENING
DIXON HAD JUST COME INTO THE ROOM FOR ANOTHER CUP OF TEA FOR MRS HALE AND CATCHING MR HALE'S LAST WORDS AND PROTECTED BY HIS PRESENCE FROM MARGARET'S UPBRAIDING EYES MADE BOLD TO SAY MY POOR MISTRESS YOU DON'T THINK HER WORSE TO-DAY SAID MR HALE TURNING HASTILY
IT WAS EVIDENTLY A HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS
I DON'T MEAN TO DESPISE THEM ANY MORE THAN I WOULD APE THEM
HE HAS SAID SO MANY A TIME
YOU SHALL COME WITH ME IF YOU LIKE
BUT IT'S WINTER AND TH CHILDER WILL CLEM A PRETTY NAVVY YOU'D MAKE
BUT HER REPETITION OF IT WOULD GAIN TIME--TIME FOR FREDERICK
FOR SHE'D BURNT IT BURNT IT EXCLAIMED BOTH MARGARET AND MR BELL
HER DINNER WAS GOING OFF WELL
I HAVE NOW TO PUT IT BEHIND ME AND BE TRUTHFUL FOR EVERMORE IF I CAN VERY WELL
THE SCENT OF LAVENDER CAME OUT AND PERFUMED THE ROOM
CLEAR IN JUDGMENT STANDING UPON HIS RIGHTS AS NO HUMAN BEING OUGHT TO STAND CONSIDERING WHAT WE AND ALL OUR PETTY RIGHTS ARE IN THE SIGHT OF THE ALMIGHTY
BUT SOME ONE HAD TOLD YOU THAT STOLEN FRUIT TASTED SWEETEST WHICH YOU TOOK AU PIED DE LA LETTRE AND OFF YOU WENT A-ROBBING
AND THE FIRST TIME I CATCH YOU MAKING MISCHIEF OFF YOU GO
SHE WITH A FIRM POWER WHICH SUBDUED HIM INTO PEACE WHILE EVERY SUDDEN CHARM AND WILE SHE POSSESSED WAS EXERTED ON THE SIDE OF RIGHT UNTIL HE WOULD RUB HIS LITTLE HOT AND TEAR-SMEARED FACE ALL OVER HERS KISSING AND CARESSING TILL HE OFTEN FELL ASLEEP IN HER ARMS OR ON HER SHOULDER
HIS EYES WERE SWOLLEN AND BLOODSHOT AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT ANY ONE WAS BY
THEN SMILED AS SHE SAID I AM NOT FOND OF BEING CATECHISED
SHE WAS A TALL WOMAN
WHAT WAS HE
WHAT WAS HE
THE FINE CRISP MORNING MADE HER MOTHER FEEL PARTICULARLY WELL AND HAPPY AT BREAKFAST-TIME
BUT MR THORNTON'S EAGER SENSES CAUGHT SOME FEW WORDS OF MR HALE'S TO MR BELL
I WON'T SAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR PRETEXT FOR COMING AND ASKING FOR WORK
ON WHAT--FOR THIS WAS A MORE EFFICACIOUS WAY OF PUTTING IT--WHAT FATHER WOULD HAVE WISHED THEM TO DO
BUT LORD SIR D'YE THINK THEIR FIRST CRY I TH MORNING IS WHAT SHALL I DO TO GET HOLD ON ETERNAL LIFE OR WHAT SHALL I DO TO FILL MY PURSE THIS BLESSED DAY
BUT IN HIS FELLOW'S ROOMS
TO PARODY A LINE OUT OF FAIRFAX'S TASSO HIS STRONG IDEA WANDERED THROUGH HER THOUGHT SHE DISLIKED HIM THE MORE FOR HAVING MASTERED HER INNER WILL
IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS MOTHER
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE IGNORANCE OF WHICH I WAS SPEAKING DID NOT RELATE TO READING AND WRITING,--THE TEACHING OR INFORMATION ONE CAN GIVE TO A CHILD
HIM AS WAS TH PARSON AY SAID THEY
IT WAS LIKE THE STORY OF THE EASTERN KING WHO DIPPED HIS HEAD INTO A BASIN OF WATER AT THE MAGICIAN'S COMMAND AND ERE HE INSTANTLY TOOK IT OUT WENT THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME
A LARGE-BONED LADY LONG PAST MIDDLE AGE SAT AT WORK IN A GRIM HANDSOMELY-FURNISHED DINING-ROOM
HE LEANT AGAINST THE CHIMNEY PIECE IN A LOUNGING ATTITUDE WHILE SHE ASKED BESSY HOW SHE WAS
IT SMELLS OF THE FRESHEST PUREST FRAGRANCE AFTER THE SMOKINESS OF HARLEY STREET
NOT MANY GIRLS WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE BLOWS ON HERSELF WHICH WERE MEANT FOR ME;--MEANT WITH RIGHT DOWN GOOD-WILL TOO A GIRL IN LOVE WILL DO A GOOD DEAL REPLIED MRS THORNTON SHORTLY
MARGARET TREMBLED ALL OVER
MR HALE HARDLY EVER SPOKE BUT WHEN HIS CHILDREN ASKED HIM QUESTIONS AND FORCED HIM AS IT WERE INTO THE PRESENT
AND NOW I SUPPOSE YOU'LL TELL MASTER AND A PRETTY HOUSEHOLD I SHALL HAVE OF YOU NO DIXON SAID MARGARET SORROWFULLY I WILL NOT TELL PAPA
AND IN THE NEXT PLACE I SEE A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISS HALE AND FANNY
IF SHE HAD CARED FOR HIM AS A LOVER AND HAD ACCEPTED HIM AND THIS CHANGE IN HER FATHER'S OPINIONS AND CONSEQUENT STATION HAD TAKEN PLACE SHE COULD NOT DOUBT BUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPATIENTLY RECEIVED BY MR LENNOX
THEY ACCORDINGLY WENT DOWN THE FLIGHT OF STEPS THAT LED TO THE LEVEL OF THE GROUND BELOW THE RAILWAY
IN WHICH CASE I WAS NOT THERE SAID MARGARET STILL KEEPING HER EXPRESSIONLESS EYES FIXED ON HIS FACE WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS LOOK OF A SLEEP-WALKER
HIGGINS SIGHED
LOUD-LAUGHING AND LOUD-SPOKEN GIRLS CLUSTERED TOGETHER APPARENTLY EXCITED TO HIGH SPIRITS AND A BOISTEROUS INDEPENDENCE OF TEMPER AND BEHAVIOUR
I WILL OPEN THE DOOR
WHAT DID HE MEAN
GOOD-BYE MARGARET--MARGARET CHAPTER IV DOUBTS AND DIFFICULTIES CAST ME UPON SOME NAKED SHORE WHERE I MAY TRACKE ONLY THE PRINT OF SOME SAD WRACKE IF THOU BE THERE THOUGH THE SEAS ROARE I SHALL NO GENTLER CALM IMPLORE HABINGTON
WHY MR THORNTON YOU'RE CUTTING ME VERY COOLLY I MUST SAY
THERE WAS THE SAME KIND OF FEATHERS TO BE HAD AND YET SOMEHOW TILL THIS LAST NIGHT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHEN SHE HAD HAD A GOOD SOUND RESTING SLEEP
YOU SEE PAPA NEVER TOLD EVEN YOU
WE MAY QUARREL AND FALL OUT--WE MAY MAKE PEACE AND BE FRIENDS--WE MAY CLEM TO SKIN AND BONE--AND NOUGHT O ALL OUR GRIEFS WILL EVER TOUCH HER MORE
AND HE WAS MORE ANNOYED TO FIND MARGARET THERE THAN BY HEARING HER LAST WORDS FOR THEN HE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD URGED HIGGINS TO COME TO HIM
AND ALTHOUGH HER HEART SANK TO THINK HE HAD NOT RATHER CHOSEN TO COME HIMSELF AND UPBRAID HER AND RECEIVE HER PENITENCE AND RESTORE HER AGAIN TO HIS GOOD OPINION YET SHE WAS TOO MUCH HUMBLED NOT TO BEAR ANY BLAME ON THIS SUBJECT PATIENTLY AND MEEKLY
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
IF TITANIA HAD EVER BEEN DRESSED IN WHITE MUSLIN AND BLUE RIBBONS AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ON A CRIMSON DAMASK SOFA IN A BACK DRAWING-ROOM EDITH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR HER
IT WILL BE SUCH A DISGRACE TO US
BUT TO-DAY THEY SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED NATURES
IT IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL INTERFERE
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HE WOULD NOT SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS IF SHE TOOK PRIDE IN ANY DELICACY OF FEELING WHICH MR THORNTON HAD SHOWN
LIGHTING FIRES IS ONE OF MY NATURAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO MARGARET WENT AWAY
AT LAST SHE SAID YO'D HA BEEN DEAVED OUT O YO'R FIVE WITS AS WELL AS ME IF YO'D HAD ONE BODY AFTER ANOTHER COMING IN TO ASK FOR FATHER AND STAYING TO TELL ME EACH ONE THEIR TALE
YES REPLIED HER FATHER
SOME SPOKE O DEADLY HATRED AND MADE MY BLOOD RUN COLD WI THE TERRIBLE THINGS THEY SAID O TH MASTERS,--BUT MORE BEING WOMEN KEPT PLAINING PLAINING WI THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS AND NEVER WIPED AWAY NOR HEEDED OF THE PRICE O MEAT AND HOW THEIR CHILDER COULD NA SLEEP AT NIGHTS FOR TH HUNGER AND DO THEY THINK THE STRIKE WILL MEND THIS ASKED MARGARET
PAPA IT IS FREDERICK
IT IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO FOR ME IN THE MATTER
HE WAS SO BUSY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND WHAT I WAS IN THE SECOND THAT HE NEVER LET OUT WHAT HE WAS
SHE HAD WANTED TO GO TO BED BUT DIXON HAD PERSUADED HER TO LIE DOWN ON THE SOFA AND HAVE HER TEA BROUGHT TO HER THERE
THE MORE YOU AX US THE MORE WE WON'T STIR THE MORE SHE TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING ANYTHING BESIDES THE DANGER TO WHICH FREDERICK WOULD BE EXPOSED--THE MORE CLOSELY HER IMAGINATION CLUNG TO THE UNFORTUNATE IDEA PRESENTED TO HER
MARGARET YEARNED AFTER THAT OLD HOUSE AND THE PLACID TRANQUILLITY OF THAT OLD WELL-ORDERED MONOTONOUS LIFE
AND HER MANNER EVEN WHEN SPEAKING ON INDIFFERENT THINGS HAD A MOURNFUL TENDERNESS ABOUT IT WHICH WAS DEEPENED WHENEVER HER LOOKS FELL ON FREDERICK AND SHE THOUGHT OF HIS RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEPARTURE
MARGARET WAS SITTING ALONE WRITING TO EDITH AND GIVING HER MANY PARTICULARS OF HER MOTHER'S LAST DAYS
PLACES UNIQUE IN THE KINGDOM I AM INFORMED
GOOD GOD
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN LET WHO WILL SAY WHAT THEY LIKE OF ME
COME TO ME SAID MARGARET TAKING HIM OFF THE DRESSER AND HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS
IF HE HAD BEEN PRESENT HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED HER TO READ IT ALOUD TO HIM AND IT WOULD HAVE RAISED IN HIM A STATE OF NERVOUS ALARM WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SOOTHE AWAY
MY ONE GREAT CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE AND MY PRICE OF SUFFERING PAID
THE FACE OFTEN SO WEARY WITH PAIN SO RESTLESS WITH TROUBLOUS THOUGHTS HAD NOW THE FAINT SOFT SMILE OF ETERNAL REST UPON IT
THAT WOULD BE A PERPETUAL INTEREST
ONLY OUR GOOD FRIEND HERE REPLIED HER FATHER HIT ON A CAPITAL EXPEDIENT FOR CLEARING THE PLACE I BID EM BEGONE AND EACH TAKE A CHILD WITH EM AND TO MIND THAT THEY WERE ORPHANS AND THEIR MOTHER A WIDOW
MISS MARGARET MY DEAR I'VE HAD TO KEEP IT DOWN THIS MANY A WEEK
AND FREDERICK WAS IN SOUTH AMERICA FOR SEVERAL YEARS WAS HE NOT YES
I DON'T THINK I COULD CALL IT A VILLAGE AT ALL
WE HAVE A WIDE COMMERCIAL CHARACTER TO MAINTAIN WHICH MAKES US INTO THE GREAT PIONEERS OF CIVILISATION IT STRIKES ME SAID MR HALE SMILING THAT YOU MIGHT PIONEER A LITTLE AT HOME
IT'S NOW THREE
IT IS MORE PAINFUL FOR YOU TO SEE THAN FOR HER TO BEAR I BELIEVE
WITHOUT ANY REASON I DARE SAY
WHY DON'T YOU ASK AFTER MR THORNTON MARGARET
I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE AWARE OF IT
WHAT IS IT DIXON ASKED MARGARET THE MOMENT SHE HAD SHUT THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR
WERE YOU EVER AT HELSTONE
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD SOME WRONG STATEMENT
MR THORNTON HAS TOLD ME NOTHING
AND EVEN THEN I AM SURE THAT IT WOULD LOSE ITS VITALITY CEASE TO BE LIVING AS SOON AS IT WAS NO LONGER CARRIED ON BY THAT SORT OF COMMON INTEREST WHICH INVARIABLY MAKES PEOPLE FIND MEANS AND WAYS OF SEEING EACH OTHER AND BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHERS CHARACTERS AND PERSONS AND EVEN TRICKS OF TEMPER AND MODES OF SPEECH
AND THOUGH HIS MOUTH WAS AS MUCH COMPRESSED AS BEFORE HIS EYES SMILED OUT BENIGNLY ON HIS QUESTIONER
THE ONLY THING SHE DID WELL WAS WHAT SHE DID OUT OF UNCONSCIOUS PIETY THE SILENT COMFORTING AND CONSOLING OF HER FATHER
EVER SINCE I READ THE TALES OF THE ALHAMBRA
FOR GEORGE AND HANNAH THORNTON AND WHAT WAS HER SON'S--BOUGHT WITH HIS MONEY MARKED WITH HIS INITIALS
MR BELL SAID THEY ABSOLUTELY LIVED UPON WATER-PORRIDGE FOR YEARS--HOW HE DID NOT KNOW
I AM GLAD HE HAS OWNED IT AT LAST
YET IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE HER INTERPRETATION AND KEEP IT DISTINCT FROM HIS MEANING
BUT LATTERLY THEY HAD NOT SPOKEN MUCH ON SUCH SUBJECTS
THE RIOT YESTERDAY HELPED TO KNOCK UP THE STRIKE AND MARGARET'S NAME WAS NO MORE MENTIONED BETWEEN MRS THORNTON AND HER SON
I SHOULD M'APPEN HA CLEANED MYSEL FIRST IT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRABLE BUT MARGARET ASSURED HIM HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE YARD AND HAVE SOAP AND TOWEL PROVIDED
CHAPTER VI FAREWELL UNWATCH'D THE GARDEN BOUGH SHALL SWAY THE TENDER BLOSSOM FLUTTER DOWN UNLOVED THAT BEECH WILL GATHER BROWN THE MAPLE BURN ITSELF AWAY
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH MARGARET
FOR SPEAKING ABOVE HER BREATH SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IRREVERENT AS LONG AS THERE WAS ANY ONE DEAD LYING IN THE HOUSE
I'D TEACH THEM THAT I WAS MASTER AND COULD EMPLOY WHAT SERVANTS I LIKED YES
YOUR ACQUAINTANCES AND MINE MUST BE SEPARATE
HE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY SILENT AT HOME
BUT MR THORNTON COMES HERE AS YOUR FRIEND--AS ONE WHO HAS APPRECIATED YOU THE ONLY PERSON IN MILTON SAID MRS HALE
BUT SHE WAS RATHER PUT OUT AS I COULD SEE BY THE LIBERTY I HAD TAKEN IN BEGGING FOR AN INVITATION FOR HIM
BUT YOU'LL LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE WORSE
GOD HELP EM SAID HE MORE CONVINCED BY HIS OWN PRESENTATION OF THE FACTS THAN BY ALL MARGARET HAD SAID AND SUDDENLY RENOUNCING THE IDEA WHICH HAD BUT RECENTLY FORMED ITSELF IN A BRAIN WORN OUT BY THE DAY'S FATIGUE AND ANXIETY
WE'LL TAKE A SNACK AND ORDER DINNER AT THE LITTLE INN--THE LENNARD ARMS IT USED TO BE,--AND GO AND GET AN APPETITE IN THE FOREST
YOU ARE ALL STRIVING FOR MONEY
CHARLOTTE LOOKED AT MARGARET WITH SURPRISE
AND I DON'T
GONE REPLIED HE
COME POOR LITTLE HEART
COULDN'T YOU BRING NURSE HERE MAMMA
A BAG OF MARBLES HERE A HOOP THERE
HOO DOESN'T LIKE THIS STRIKE
SHE'S MY LANDLORD NOW YOU KNOW HIGGINS
WHY MARGARET HOW STRANGE YOU LOOK
I KEPT THE DOOR OPEN AND HEARD A MESSAGE GIVEN TO SOME MAN THAT WAS IN MY FATHER'S STUDY AND THAT THEN WENT AWAY
THEN MR HALE BROUGHT ALL HIS BUDGET OF GRIEVANCES AND LAID IT BEFORE MR THORNTON FOR HIM WITH HIS EXPERIENCE AS A MASTER TO ARRANGE THEM AND EXPLAIN THEIR ORIGIN
MY MOTHER IS NOT GIVEN TO COMPLAINTS SAID HE A LITTLE PROUDLY
THERE WAS A DREAMINESS IN THE REST TOO WHICH MADE IT STILL MORE PERFECT AND LUXURIOUS TO REPOSE IN
EDITH IS RIGHT ENOUGH IN SAYING IT'S THE SMOKE THAT HAS MADE ME SO ILL MARGARET STARTED UP AS HER MOTHER SAID THIS
IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
HE SPOKE TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT YOU AT OXFORD
THAT DOLORES BARBOUR THAT I WAS TELLING YOU OF MARGARET--I ONLY WISH YOU KNEW HER
BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU ONCE AGAIN MRS THORNTON TO--TO APOLOGISE FOR MY MANNER THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU
AND IT HAS DONE MASTER GOOD
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE
FOR IF MR THORNTON HAD INDEED MADE THE ATTEMPT TO SPEAK THE MOMENTARY INSTINCT TO LISTEN TO HIM WAS PAST AND GONE AND THE PEOPLE WERE RAGING WORSE THAN EVER
HE STOPPED TO SPEAK TO THE OVERLOOKER
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED BY ME AND NEVER COME AGAIN
OF COURSE MAMMA MUST FEEL YOUR CHANGE OF OPINIONS
DON'T LET US BE PERSONAL IN OUR CATECHISM
VERY DIFFERENT TO MY BUSINESS WHICH IS THE REAL TRUE LAW BUSINESS
AND INDEED SHE HAD NEVER PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD CARED FOR HER OPINIONS AS BELONGING TO HER THE INDIVIDUAL
I TOLD A LIE AND HER FACE BECAME SCARLET
HE STOOD BY THE CHIMNEY-PIECE WITH HIS FACE TURNED AWAY FROM THE ROOM
LOOK HERE--IN DARKSHIRE HARDLY THE BREADTH OF MY FINGER FROM MILTON IS HESTON WHICH I HAVE OFTEN HEARD OF FROM PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NORTH AS SUCH A PLEASANT LITTLE BATHING-PLACE
YOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT ALL IF I TOLD YOU--MY ANXIETY FOR YEARS PAST TO KNOW WHETHER I HAD ANY RIGHT TO HOLD MY LIVING--MY EFFORTS TO QUENCH MY SMOULDERING DOUBTS BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH
THEY WERE QUIET WISHES TO BE SURE AND HARDLY NAMED WITHOUT HESITATION AND APOLOGY
I DON'T UNDERSTAND AT OXFORD
VERY FEW PEOPLE DO SPEAK THE EXACT TRUTH
AND SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT PATIENCE
LIKE AN OLD FOOL I THOUGHT THAT EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE THE SAME OPINIONS AS I HAD
I KNOW HIS FACE THOUGH HE IS LIVID WITH RAGE,--HE IS FIGHTING TO GET TO THE FRONT--LOOK
SHE WAS LYING LANGUIDLY IN BED WHEN MRS HALE CAME UP TO MAKE SOME LAST INQUIRIES AND KISS HER BEFORE GOING TO HER OWN ROOM FOR THE NIGHT
BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
A LITTLE PICTURESQUE VILLAGE LIKE SOME IN THE ODENWALD
THE WORST IS THE WASPS ARE IMPUDENT ENOUGH TO DISPUTE IT WITH ONE EVEN AT THE VERY CRISIS AND SUMMIT OF ENJOYMENT
AND AS HE LOOKED WITH THIS INTENTION HE WAS STRUCK ANEW WITH HER GREAT BEAUTY
YOU MEAN I SUPPOSE THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU OUGHT TO THANK ME FOR WHAT I DID IN SPITE OF HERSELF--IN DEFIANCE OF HER ANGER--THE THICK BLUSHES CAME ALL OVER HER FACE AND BURNT INTO HER VERY EYES
I SAW YOUR FATHER LOOKING GRAVE AT ME
WHILE SHE AS RED AS ANY CARNATION BEGAN TO WORK WITH DOUBLE DILIGENCE BUT I BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAYS IS THE TRUTH
NO SOUND
PERHAPS NOT WHEN I FIRST CAME IN--NOW I THINK OF IT
WITH THE LOVELY LITTLE BORDERS MARGARET HEARD HER AUNT'S VOICE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD RAISED HERSELF UP FROM HER HALF-RECUMBENT POSITION AND WERE LOOKING INTO THE MORE DIMLY LIGHTED BACK DRAWING-ROOM
THOUGH IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE'D BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO
BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HARDLY OF MR HALE HIMSELF
YES I DO
THE MEN WERE RENDERED DIZZY BY IT
MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION
HE CAN WIPE THEM I SUPPOSE SAID MR HALE
HER LIPS WERE JUST PARTED OVER THEM ALLOWING THE WHITE LINE TO BE SEEN BETWEEN THEIR CURVE
THAT WAS THE IDEA OF MERCHANT-LIFE WITH WHICH MR THORNTON HAD STARTED
MR HAMPER WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO GLAD TO HAVE SECURED HIM AS A STEADY AND EXPERIENCED PARTNER FOR HIS SON WHOM HE WAS SETTING UP WITH A LARGE CAPITAL IN A NEIGHBOURING TOWN
THE NIGHT WAS WEARING AWAY AND THE DAY WAS AT HAND WHEN WITHOUT A WORD OF PREPARATION MARGARET'S VOICE BROKE UPON THE STILLNESS OF THE ROOM WITH A CLEARNESS OF SOUND THAT STARTLED EVEN HERSELF
THEY'LL HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TO CATCH SOME OF THE MOB
I WENT FOR HIM MYSELF THANK YOU MOTHER HE STOPPED AND PARTLY HELD OUT HIS HAND TO GIVE HER A GRATEFUL SHAKE
STOOD STILL
MISS HALE I KNOW DOES NOT LIKE TO HEAR MEN CALLED HANDS SO I WON'T USE THAT WORD THOUGH IT COMES MOST READILY TO MY LIPS AS THE TECHNICAL TERM WHOSE ORIGIN WHATEVER IT WAS DATES BEFORE MY TIME
HER EYES WERE ON THAT LATE-BLOWING ROSE AS SHE WAS TRYING TO ANSWER
I MERELY THOUGHT THAT AS STRANGERS NEWLY COME TO RESIDE IN A TOWN WHICH HAS RISEN TO EMINENCE IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE CHARACTER AND PROGRESS OF ITS PECULIAR BUSINESS YOU MIGHT HAVE CARED TO VISIT SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE IT IS CARRIED ON
I AM GOING FOR THE DOCTOR OH
SHE SHRANK FROM FOLLOWING OUT THE PREMISES TO THEIR CONCLUSION AND SO ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSELF HOW MUCH SHE VALUED HIS RESPECT AND GOOD OPINION
BUT I FELT SURE OF SYMPATHY FROM MR BELL
AND YET IF SHE DREW BACK NOW IT WOULD BE WORSE THAN EVER--SURE TO DRIVE HIM TO THE GIN-SHOP
I COULD NOT BEAR IT MARGARET
IT SEEMED CRUEL TO REFUSE HIM THE COMFORT HE CRAVED FOR
JUST THE CHARACTER I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT BEFOREHAND YOU WOULD HAVE ADMIRED MARGARET SO I DO,--SO I SHOULD
BEAUTIFUL CREATURE INDEED
AND WHEN NEXT THEY COULD HEAR MR THORNTON WAS SPEAKING
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
MARGARET DEAR SAID HE DRAWING HER CLOSER THINK OF THE EARLY MARTYRS
AH NEWTON SAID SHE I THINK WE SHALL ALL BE SORRY TO LEAVE THIS DEAR OLD ROOM INDEED MISS I SHAN'T FOR ONE
THE NEXT MORNING THERE CAME A LETTER FROM WALLIS HIS SERVANT STATING THAT HIS MASTER HAD NOT BEEN FEELING WELL FOR SOME TIME WHICH HAD BEEN THE TRUE REASON OF HIS PUTTING OFF HIS JOURNEY
SHE WILL HAVE A GOOD LONG SLEEP
HE SHOOK MR THORNTON VEHEMENTLY BY THE HAND UNTIL THE GRIPE ENDED IN A SUDDEN RELAXATION FOR THE HAND WAS WANTED TO WIPE AWAY TEARS
WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN AND I DENIED IT STOUTLY--NOT MANY WEEKS AGO--WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN
HER EYES LOOK BRIGHTER AND HER COMPLEXION CLEARER GOD BLESS YOU SAID HER FATHER EARNESTLY
AND MASTER FREDERICK'S LIKE ONE CRAZED WITH CRYING AND MASTER NEVER WAS A GOOD ONE FOR SETTLING
VERY WELL SIR
BUT I WAS OUT LAST WEEK MUCH LATER MARGARET WAS THANKFUL WHEN THE PARTING WAS OVER--THE PARTING FROM THE DEAD MOTHER AND THE LIVING FATHER
NOT AT FIRST AND NOT TILL I HAD PUT IT INTO HIS HEAD I ADMIRED MISS HALE
HIS VISITOR WAS A DIFFERENT MAN TO WHAT HE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE AT THE WEDDING-BREAKFAST AND AT DINNER TO-DAY
BESIDES I AM SURE YOU ARE TOO WISE--TOO EXPERIENCED TO HAVE PROMISED TO KEEP THE SECRET WELL SAID HE HALF-SMILING THOUGH SADLY ENOUGH THERE YOU ARE RIGHT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOUR IRISH PEOPLE SENT TO THE DRAGON FOR A GOOD MEAL FOR THEM POOR WRETCHES
ALL THAT AFTERNOON SHE HAD TO ACT THE PART OF A ROMAN DAUGHTER AND GIVE STRENGTH OUT OF HER OWN SCANTY STOCK TO HER FATHER
MR HALE WAS PUZZLED
THIS EVENING--SIXTEEN HOURS AT MOST HAD PAST BY--SHE SAT DOWN TOO FULL OF SORROW TO CRY BUT WITH A DULL COLD PAIN WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE PRESSED THE YOUTH AND BUOYANCY OUT OF HER HEART NEVER TO RETURN
MARGARET WAS ALMOST STUNNED
I BELIEVE WOMEN ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERY PLAGUE IN THIS WORLD
MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
IT IS THIS SOFT DAMP UNHEALTHY AIR NO--NO MAMMA IT IS NOT THAT
YO NEVER SAW A MAN SO DOWN-HEARTED AS HE IS BUT WHY ASKED MARGARET
BUT WHERE CONTINUED MRS THORNTON HAVE THESE RELATIONS BEEN ALL THIS TIME THAT MISS HALE HAS APPEARED ALMOST FRIENDLESS AND HAS CERTAINLY HAD A GOOD DEAL OF ANXIETY TO BEAR BUT SHE DID NOT FEEL INTEREST ENOUGH IN THE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION TO WAIT FOR IT
THIS WAS THEN THE REASON WHY HIS SYMPATHY IN HER EXTREME DISTRESS AT HER FATHER'S LEAVING THE CHURCH HAD BEEN SO FAINTLY EXPRESSED IN HIS LETTERS
IT WAS INTERMINGLING THE COARSENESS OF HORROR WITH THE PROFOUNDNESS OF NATURAL GRIEF
IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME AS IT WAS SHE GRUMBLED
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO FRED
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A STRIKE BY WAY OF SOMETHING PLEASANT TO TALK ABOUT HAVE THE HANDS ACTUALLY TURNED OUT ASKED MRS THORNTON WITH VIVID INTEREST
DO YOU REMEMBER POOR BOUCHER SAYING THAT THE UNION WAS A TYRANT
THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN WHAT WAS HERS AND CONSEQUENTLY MARKED G
A VILLAGE IN A TALE SCORNED MARGARET
I WANT TO SEE THEM
BUT WHERE WERE THEY TO GO TO
IT'S ONLY THIS VERY MORNING I PLUNGED SOME FRESH-GATHERED ROSES HEAD DOWNWARD IN THE WATER-JUG FOR THOUGHT I PERHAPS SOME ONE WILL BE COMING AND THERE'S NOTHING SO SWEET AS SPRING-WATER SCENTED BY A MUSK ROSE OR TWO
YOU ARE NOT WRITING SAID HER MOTHER AT LAST BRING ME SOME PENS AND PAPER
MARGARET STARTED TO HER FEET,--FOR SHE THOUGHT BY THE WORKING OF HIS FACE HE WAS GOING INTO CONVULSIONS
IT WAS REFERRED TO MR THORNTON WHO HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE
NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
SHE SILENTLY TOOK A VERY DECIDED PART IN THE QUESTION THEY WERE DISCUSSING
AND HEAVIER SLOWER PLASH THAN EVEN TEARS CAME THE DRIP OF BLOOD FROM HER WOUND
SHE HAD A BRACELET ON ONE TAPER ARM WHICH WOULD FALL DOWN OVER HER ROUND WRIST
MARGARET SAID HER FATHER THE NEXT DAY WE MUST RETURN MRS THORNTON'S CALL
DID HE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT NO ANSWER AT FIRST
A PRETTY JOKE INDEED IF FOR FEAR OF A HAUGHTY GIRL I FAILED IN DOING A KINDNESS TO A MAN I LIKED
THE POWER OF MASTERS AND MEN BECAME MORE EVENLY BALANCED
BUT SHE SEEMED MUCH AS USUAL THE NEXT DAY
AND THEN IF IT WILL MAKE YOUR MIND EASIER HE CAN SEE YOUR MOTHER THANK YOU DEAR PAPA
YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHAT YOUR TROUBLE IS
YO'LL SEE IT'LL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME BUT ALL THIS TIME YOU'VE NOT TOLD ME WHAT YOU'RE STRIKING FOR SAID MARGARET AGAIN
MARGARET WAS NOT A READY LOVER BUT WHERE SHE LOVED SHE LOVED PASSIONATELY AND WITH NO SMALL DEGREE OF JEALOUSY
ALL I MEANT TO SAY IS THAT THERE IS NO HUMAN LAW TO PREVENT THE EMPLOYERS FROM UTTERLY WASTING OR THROWING AWAY ALL THEIR MONEY IF THEY CHOOSE
AT LAST BESSY SAID I NEVER THOUGHT TO HEAR FATHER CALL ON GOD AGAIN
SHE DID NOT SPEAK EXCEPT WHEN SPOKEN TO
BUT IN THIS CASE SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS TO PREVENT MR THORNTON FROM FEELING ANNOYANCE AT THE WORDS HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD THAT IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING THAT SHE COLOURED ALL OVER WITH CONSCIOUSNESS MORE ESPECIALLY AS MR THORNTON SEEMED HARDLY TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT GIST OR BEARING OF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING BUT PASSED HER BY WITH A COLD RESERVE OF CEREMONIOUS MOVEMENT TO SPEAK TO MRS HALE
AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE THERE WAS THE SECRET MOTIVE AS MARGARET KNEW FROM HER OWN FEELINGS
I AM RIGHTLY PUNISHED YOU MUST NOT TALK SO SAID MARGARET IMPATIENTLY
AND THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MARGARET TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH HER NEW SISTER-IN-LAW
AND SHE CRIED BITTERLY
ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES MARGARET
WE TELL THEM WE MAY HAVE TO LOWER WAGES
THE BISHOP HAD OFFERED HIM ANOTHER LIVING IT IS TRUE BUT IF HE HAD COME TO ENTERTAIN CERTAIN DOUBTS HE COULD HAVE REMAINED WHERE HE WAS AND SO HAD NO OCCASION TO RESIGN
AND HOW SHE WAS BIDDEN NOT TO CRY BY THE NURSE BECAUSE IT WOULD DISTURB MISS EDITH
SHE NEEDED BODILY STRENGTHENING AND BRACING AS WELL AS REST
THEY KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH
EVERYBODY IS ILL NOW I THINK SAID MRS HALE WITH A LITTLE OF THE JEALOUSY WHICH ONE INVALID IS APT TO FEEL OF ANOTHER
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WONDERED THAT PARENTS SO HANDSOME SHOULD HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO WAS SO FAR FROM REGULARLY BEAUTIFUL
IT MIGHT BE RATHER RAMPANT IN ITS DISPLAY AND SAVOUR OF BOASTING
WHILE I GO AND TELL HIM SHE GROPED HER WAY TO THE TAPER AND THE LUCIFER MATCHES
A BAD-LOOKING MAN WHO SEEMED TO HAVE DRUNK HIMSELF INTO A STATE OF BRUTALITY ALTHOUGH HIS SENSES WERE IN PERFECT ORDER
AND HE HAS HAD NEW GRATES PUT IN AND A PLATE-GLASS WINDOW IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
BUT EVERY SENTENCE HE UTTERED ADDED TO MR HALE'S RELIANCE AND REGARD FOR HIM
THE ROUND WHITE ARMS AND TAPER HANDS LAID LIGHTLY ACROSS EACH OTHER BUT PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS IN THEIR PRETTY ATTITUDE
I HAVE EVERY CHANCE OF A GOOD NIGHT MYSELF AND YOU ARE LOOKING VERY PALE WITH YOUR WATCHING
I SIMPLY SAY THAT YOU OWE ME NO GRATITUDE
NEVER TO FOLD THE ROBE O'ER SECRET PAIN NEVER WEIGHED DOWN BY MEMORY'S CLOUDS AGAIN TO BOW THY HEAD
IT WAS A NINE DAYS WONDER
I'LL HAVE NO LAGGARDS AT MY MILL
OR SUS MON PAUVRE COEUR NOUS VOILA TOMBEZ DANS LA FOSSE LAQUELLE NOUS AVIONS TANT RESOLU D'ESCHAPPER
YOUR CARPET-BAG
THIS IF NOT THE EXACT FORCE OF HER WORDS WAS AT ANY RATE THE SPIRIT OF WHAT SHE URGED ON MARGARET TILL THE LATTER WEAK WEARY AND BROKEN-SPIRITED YIELDED A RELUCTANT PROMISE THAT AS SOON AS WEDNESDAY WAS OVER SHE WOULD PREPARE TO ACCOMPANY HER AUNT BACK TO TOWN LEAVING DIXON IN CHARGE OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYING BILLS DISPOSING OF FURNITURE AND SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE
SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH A SMILE WHICH HAD NOT A TINGE OF SHYNESS OR SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IN IT
I NEVER CAN WHEN THERE IS SUCH A TERRIBLE WIND
BUT I CANNOT SEE WHY SHE DIED
I REMEMBER
BUT SUCH A HEAD AS HE HAS AND SO PRUDENT WITH ALL HIS DARING THEN ONE MAN DRAWS ANOTHER ASIDE AND WALKS A LITTLE APART AND WITH HEAD INCLINED INTO HIS NEIGHBOUR'S EAR HE SAYS THORNTON'S BUSINESS IS LARGE
IF YOU MUST PAY THESE CALLS I WILL GO WITH YOU
WITH HER FATHER
IF IT WERE SO SHE FELT NO GRATITUDE TO HIM AS IT ONLY SHOWED HER HOW KEENLY HE MUST HAVE SEEN THAT SHE WAS DISGRACED ALREADY BEFORE HE TOOK SUCH UNWONTED PAINS TO SPARE HER ANY FURTHER TRIAL OF TRUTHFULNESS WHICH HAD ALREADY FAILED SO SIGNALLY
HIGGINS WAS KNOWN TO HIM BY NAME AS A TURBULENT SPIRIT
IT'S THAT HIGGINS SIR
AND WE--MARGARET I BELIEVE--SUGGESTED THAT IT WOULD DO HIM GOOD TO ASSOCIATE A LITTLE WITH MILTON MANUFACTURERS I BEG YOUR PARDON
YET HE WAS TOO PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WEAKNESS BY AVOIDING THE SIGHT OF HER
AS HE GOT NEAR THE STREET IN WHICH HE KNEW SHE LIVED HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS CLOTHES HIS HANDS AND SHOES
BUT MRS SHAW SAID THAT HER ONLY CHILD SHOULD MARRY FOR LOVE,--AND SIGHED EMPHATICALLY AS IF LOVE HAD NOT BEEN HER MOTIVE FOR MARRYING THE GENERAL
BUT HER EYE CAUGHT THE MOMENT WHEN HE WAS READY FOR ANOTHER CUP
I WOULD DO ANYTHING,--BUT WHAT CAN I DO MISS THERE'--FOR MARGARET HAD RE-ENTERED THE ROOM AND STOOD SILENT LISTENING--'HAS OFTEN TALKED GRAND O THE SOUTH AND THE WAYS DOWN THERE
HE IS THE LAND-LORD OF THE HOUSE MY FATHER WISHES TO TAKE IN CRAMPTON MR THORNTON KNEW THE HOUSE
I TRY TO THINK THEY WILL
DUNNA YO THINK THAT HE'LL DO IT
AND SHE CLUNG TO THE IDEA OF THEIR GOING WITH EVEN FRETFUL PERTINACITY WHEN MARGARET OBJECTED
NONE OF MY WITNESSES SEEMED CERTAIN OF ANYTHING EXCEPT THE YOUNG WOMAN
AND THIS THOUGHT UNCONSCIOUSLY ADDED TO HER NATURAL DESIRE OF PLEASING ONE WHO WAS SHOWING HER KINDNESS BY HER VISIT
BUT OF COURSE THE EFFORT NOT TO THINK OF THEM BROUGHT THEM ONLY THE MORE STRONGLY BEFORE HER
HE HAD THAT GRACE
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED OF FANNY'S BEING SEEN OUT AFTER DARK IN RATHER A LONELY PLACE WALKING ABOUT WITH A YOUNG MAN
PERHAPS IT IS ONE OF THE ECONOMIES HE STILL PRACTISES TO LIVE IN A VERY SMALL HOUSE
YET HE DEEMED HER SO ATTACHED TO SOME OTHER MAN SO LED AWAY BY HER AFFECTION FOR HIM AS TO VIOLATE HER TRUTHFUL NATURE
NOUGHT TO HELP THE STARVING TURN-OUT
INDEED HE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HIM
THEN HE INDULGED HIMSELF IN THE TORTURE OF THINKING IT ALL OVER AND REALISING EVERY DETAIL
TILL FROM THE GARDEN AND THE WILD A FRESH ASSOCIATION BLOW AND YEAR BY YEAR THE LANDSCAPE GROW FAMILIAR TO THE STRANGER'S CHILD
THY LILE JACK SHALL NA CLEM
INVESTMENTS AND LEASES AND VALUE OF LAND OH GO AWAY IF THAT'S ALL
LAST OF ALL HE HAD TO GO HOME AND ENCOUNTER HIS MOTHER
THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL AND QUIET AND DARKNESS CAME ON WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT TO PROCURE CANDLES
FOR I'M SURE YOU NEED IT POOR CHILD GOOD-NIGHT PAPA SHE LET HER COLOUR GO--THE FORCED SMILE FADE AWAY--THE EYES GROW DULL WITH HEAVY PAIN
THE PITIFUL FIGURE HE MUST HAVE CUT
SAGACIOUS AND STRONG AS BECOMES A GREAT TRADESMAN DON'T CALL THE MILTON MANUFACTURERS TRADESMEN MARGARET SAID HER FATHER
I HEARD YOUR NAME FREQUENTLY MENTIONED DURING MY SHORT STAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THEN THEY LOST SOME WORDS
AND THEN THE CONVICTION WENT IN AS IF BY SOME SPELL AND TOUCHED THE LATENT TENDERNESS OF HIS HEART
SHE PLAYED WITH HER TEASPOON AND DID NOT ATTEND PARTICULARLY TO WHAT MR BELL SAID
I ALMOST HOPED YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN GLAD TO LEAVE HELSTONE MAMMA SAID SHE AFTER A PAUSE
MARGARET WAS LIGHTING THE LAMP WHEN HE ENTERED FOR THE DARKNESS WAS COMING ON
IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
I WILL GO SAID SHE
OF COURSE SPEAKING SO OF THE FATE THAT AS A MASTER MIGHT BE HIS OWN IN THE FLUCTUATIONS OF COMMERCE HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE MORE SYMPATHY WITH THAT OF THE WORKMEN WHO WERE PASSED BY IN THE SWIFT MERCILESS IMPROVEMENT OR ALTERATION WHO WOULD FAIN LIE DOWN AND QUIETLY DIE OUT OF THE WORLD THAT NEEDED THEM NOT BUT FELT AS IF THEY COULD NEVER REST IN THEIR GRAVES FOR THE CLINGING CRIES OF THE BELOVED AND HELPLESS THEY WOULD LEAVE BEHIND
I CAN READ HER PROUD BONNY FACE LIKE A BOOK
STILL HE DID NOT COME
IT MAY BE A STRAW'S BREADTH SHORTER OR LONGER-WAISTED ACCORDING TO MY HAVING GROWN FAT OR THIN
AND BY AN ABRUPT YET APROPOS QUESTION HE TURNED THE CURRENT OF THE CONVERSATION SO AS NOT TO GIVE MR THORNTON THE MORTIFICATION OF ACKNOWLEDGING HIS WANT OF SUCCESS AND CONSEQUENT CHANGE OF POSITION
MARY HAD A VERY BLUNT INTELLECT ALTHOUGH HER FEELINGS WERE WARM AND KIND
THINKING HAS MANY A TIME MADE ME SAD DARLING
I DUNNOT BELIEVE SHE'LL EVER LIVE AGAIN SAID HE SITTING DOWN AND DREARILY GOING ON AS IF TO THE UNSYMPATHISING FIRE
I SHOULD BE THANKFU TO YO IF YO'D GIVE ME WORK
HIS HEART BEAT THICK AT THE THOUGHT OF HER COMING
BUT MR THORNTON'S BROW DARKENED
AND YOU SEEM NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT THE DUTIES OF A MANUFACTURER ARE FAR LARGER AND WIDER THAN THOSE MERELY OF AN EMPLOYER OF LABOUR
MARGARET TOLD HIM ALL THAT DIXON HAD RELATED OF HER INTERVIEW WITH YOUNG LEONARDS
BUT FATHER WON'T LET EM WANT NOW HE KNOWS
THE EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE WAS OF GENTLE PATIENT SADNESS--NAY OF POSITIVE PRESENT SUFFERING
LET ME SPEAK TO HER OH NO
HE'S AN I MEAN HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN MUCH OF WHAT WE DO OH DEAR
PRAY WHOSE OPINION DID YOU THINK WOULD HAVE THE MOST OBSTINATE VITALITY MR THORNTON HAD NOT A NOTION WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND DISDAINED TO INQUIRE
MARGARET KNELT DOWN BY HER
IMPROVIDENT AND SELF-INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
SO IT WOULD IN FACT BE UNITING BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE NO PAPA YOU CANNOT SPARE ME AND WHAT'S MORE I WON'T BE SPARED THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED
MRS THORNTON CAME TO SEE MRS HALE THE NEXT MORNING
I HAVE A RIGHT TO ABUSE MY BIRTH-PLACE
TO-MORROW--YES TO-MORROW THEY WILL BE BACK IN HARLEY STREET
IT IS DELICIOUS AIR
IN LONDON,--GOING THROUGH THE OLD ROUND
STILL IF IT FAILS AND IF IT FAILS SAID SHE ADVANCING AND LAYING HER HAND ON HIS ARM HER EYES FULL OF EAGER LIGHT
SHE WISHED SHE HAD SPOKEN MORE--STRONGER
I NE'ER COULD FIND TH WORDS
WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION
HER MERCHANTS BE LIKE PRINCES SAID HIS MOTHER READING THE TEXT ALOUD AS IF IT WERE A TRUMPET-CALL TO INVITE HER BOY TO THE STRUGGLE
SHE'S SEVENTEEN BUT SHE'S TH LAST ON US
ONE EVENING IT WAS ARRANGED THAT MARGARET AND HER FATHER SHOULD GO THE NEXT DAY TO MILTON-NORTHERN AND LOOK OUT FOR A HOUSE
HE SHOWED MORE RESOLUTE STRENGTH THAN I SHOULD EVER HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT FOR FORMERLY PERHAPS I HAVE BEEN WRONGLY INFORMED
THAT WILL DO GOOD TO BOTH OF US MR HALE AND MARGARET KNELT BY THE WINDOW-SEAT--HE LOOKING UP SHE BOWED DOWN IN HUMBLE SHAME
I HAD A FEARFU NIGHT WI DREAMS--OR SOMEWHAT LIKE DREAMS FOR I WERE WIDE AWAKE--AND I'M ALL IN A SWOUNDING DAZE TO-DAY,--ONLY YON POOR CHAP MADE ME ALIVE AGAIN
WE WILL GO SO AS TO CATCH HIM JUST AFTER HIS DINNER AND BEFORE HE GOES TO HIS WORK TOWARDS EVENING MR HALE SAID
AS FOR THAT GIRL SHE MIGHT BE BOLD BUT SHE'D NEVER BE GIDDY
I AM SURE IT IS NOT OR YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
THIS MILTON MANUFACTURER HIS GREAT TENDER HEART SCORNED AS IT WAS SCORNED SAID TO ME ONLY LAST NIGHT GO TO HER
SO TAKE YOUR TEA MA'AM IN COMFORT AND TRUST TO ME MRS HALE DID TRUST IN DIXON MORE THAN IN MARGARET
BUT THAT THERE ARE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH WOULD RATHER IMPLY--TO ME AT LEAST--THAT THEY NEGLECTED THEIR DUTY AS STEWARDS IF THEY DID SO
IN TWENTY-TWO DAYS I SHALL SEE MY BOY SHE FELL BACK AND FOR A SHORT TIME SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT MARGARET SAT MOTIONLESS HER HAND SHADING HER EYES
YO KNOWED SHE HAD A BROTHER YES I KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MR HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MR HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT TOO OF THE TYRANNY THEY EXERCISED OVER THEIR WORK-PEOPLE
IT WOULD TAKE A DEAL TO DAUNT ME IN MY OWN HOUSE AS HE SEES
MARGARET FANCIED THAT HE COULD NOT BE WELL
BUT THE IMPRESSION OF THIS FIGURE OF MARGARET--WITH ALL MARGARET'S CHARACTER TAKEN OUT OF IT AS COMPLETELY AS IF SOME EVIL SPIRIT HAD GOT POSSESSION OF HER FORM--WAS SO DEEPLY STAMPED UPON HIS IMAGINATION THAT WHEN HE WAKENED HE FELT HARDLY ABLE TO SEPARATE THE UNA FROM THE DUESSA
MARGARET YEARNED TO RE-UNITE THE BOND OF INTIMATE CONFIDENCE WHICH HAD BEEN BROKEN BY HER LONG RESIDENCE AT HER AUNT SHAW'S AND STROVE BY GENTLE CARESSES AND SOFTENED WORDS TO CREEP INTO THE WARMEST PLACE IN HER MOTHER'S HEART
YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK
SHE SAW IT WAS THE SPARK TO THE GUNPOWDER AND WITH A CRY WHICH NO ONE HEARD SHE RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN STAIRS,--SHE HAD LIFTED THE GREAT IRON BAR OF THE DOOR WITH AN IMPERIOUS FORCE--HAD THROWN THE DOOR OPEN WIDE--AND WAS THERE IN FACE OF THAT ANGRY SEA OF MEN HER EYES SMITING THEM WITH FLAMING ARROWS OF REPROACH
AND YOU DROVE HIM MAD MARGARET SAID HER FATHER IN A LOW AND WARNING TONE FOR HE SAW THE CLOUD GATHERING ON HIGGINS'S FACE
THEY HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD AND ALL ALONG EDITH HAD BEEN REMARKED UPON BY EVERY ONE EXCEPT MARGARET FOR HER PRETTINESS
AND THAT IT WAS ANOTHER WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE MR THORNTON'S PALE GRAVE FACE GROW DOUBLY WAN AND STERN AT DIXON'S ANSWER
TRY LIVING A YEAR OR TWO AMONG THEM AS LOOKS AWAY IF YO LOOK AT EM
THAT CAN'T HAVE GONE YELLOW NO
AND MARGARET FOUND A USE IN HERSELF FOR THE PATIENCE SHE HAD BEEN CRAVING FOR HIM
DIXON OPENED THE DOOR VERY SOFTLY AND STOLE ON TIPTOE UP TO MARGARET SITTING BY THE SHADED WINDOW
FREDERICK HAD BEEN SAFE AND OUT OF ENGLAND TWENTY NAY THIRTY HOURS AGO
THE STRAIN HAD BEEN TERRIBLE AS SHE NOW FELT
HELPED ON MATERIALLY BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ONE OF THE CREDITORS A CRABBED OLD FELLOW MR BELL SAYS TAKING IN MR THORNTON AS A KIND OF PARTNER THAT REALLY IS FINE SAID MARGARET
ONLY A FORTNIGHT AGO
IT MAKES MARGARET VERY HOPEFUL MR BELL NODDED
I CANNOT TELL YOU HALF ITS BEAUTY
HE CAME AT LAST HIS ARMS HANGING LOOSE DOWN HIS HEAD SUNK AND WALKING HEAVILY ALONG AS IF EVERY STEP WAS A LABOUR AND A TROUBLE
IT GOES FARTHER THAN A WHOLE COURSE OF LECTURES ON HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY"--LIFE DILUTED INTO WORDS
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WILL LIKE TO LEAVE MRS LENNOX AT SUCH AN INTERESTING TIME SAID DIXON WHO DID NOT MUCH APPROVE OF A STRANGER ENTERING THE HOUSEHOLD TO SHARE WITH HER IN HER RULING CARE OF MARGARET
A WORSE SAILOR WAS NEVER ON BOARD SHIP--NOR A MUCH WORSE MAN EITHER
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY AUNT MRS SHAW
AS SHE THOUGHT OF THE DELIGHT OF FILLING THE IMPORTANT POST OF ONLY DAUGHTER IN HELSTONE PARSONAGE PIECES OF THE CONVERSATION OUT OF THE NEXT ROOM CAME UPON HER EARS
BUT TO HAVE YOU OTHER THAN WHAT YOU ARE WILL BREAK MY HEART
IT WAS QUITE SUDDEN
EACH CHAIR AND SOFA HAD ITS OWN PARTICULAR VEIL OF NETTING OR KNITTING
EVERYBODY RUSHING OVER EVERYBODY IN THEIR HURRY TO GET RICH IT IS NOT EVERY ONE WHO CAN SIT COMFORTABLY IN A SET OF COLLEGE ROOMS AND LET HIS RICHES GROW WITHOUT ANY EXERTION OF HIS OWN
BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED CAUTIOUSLY AND DIXON PUT HER HEAD IN
HE TRIED SO TO COMPENSATE HIMSELF FOR THE MORTIFIED FEELING THAT WHILE HE LOOKED UPON HER WITH AN ADMIRATION HE COULD NOT REPRESS SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PROUD INDIFFERENCE TAKING HIM HE THOUGHT FOR WHAT IN HIS IRRITATION HE TOLD HIMSELF HE WAS--A GREAT ROUGH FELLOW WITH NOT A GRACE OR A REFINEMENT ABOUT HIM
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT I WAS THINKING I HAD HARDLY HEARD MR THORNTON'S NAME BEFORE I CAME TO MILTON
PAPA HAS ALWAYS SPENT THE INCOME HE DERIVED FROM HIS LIVING IN THE PARISH
SHOWING THAT AS TRADE WAS CONDUCTED THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A WAXING AND WANING OF COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY
HAVE YOU BEEN A VERY LONG WALK TO-DAY ASKED SHE ON SEEING HIS REFUSAL TO TOUCH FOOD OF ANY KIND
HE HAS A GOOD WARM HEART UNDER HIS BLUFF ABRUPT WAYS I AM SURE OF IT REPLIED MR HALE
MR HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
I'M WELLY FELLED WI SEEING HIM
HIGGINS'S EYE FELL ON THE CHILDREN
THE DOCTORS HAD DISCOVERED AN INTERNAL DISEASE FAR ADVANCED AND SURE TO PROVE FATAL
IT WAS NOW DRAWING NEAR TO THE ANNIVERSARY OF EDITH'S MARRIAGE AND LOOKING BACK UPON THE YEAR'S ACCUMULATED HEAP OF TROUBLES MARGARET WONDERED HOW THEY HAD BEEN BORNE
MARGARET WENT VERY WHITE AND COMPRESSED HER LIPS A LITTLE MORE
THE MOST PROUDLY INDEPENDENT MAN DEPENDS ON THOSE AROUND HIM FOR THEIR INSENSIBLE INFLUENCE ON HIS CHARACTER--HIS LIFE
SHE WOULD NOT TAKE A FLOWER THE DAY BEFORE FOR FEAR OF BEING OBSERVED AND HER MOTIVES AND FEELINGS COMMENTED UPON
MY FATHER WILL RETURN SOON AND THEN YOU CAN TELL HIM MARGARET OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN WITH THE STRAIGHT FEARLESS DIGNIFIED PRESENCE HABITUAL TO HER
NOT A FAILURE
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN AND THEY ENTERED
AS IT IS--MARGARET I DARE NOT TELL HER NO SAID MARGARET SADLY I WILL DO IT
AND HER FATHER WAS BEGINNING TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT HER WHEN NEWS ARRIVED FROM ONE OR TWO QUARTERS THAT PROMISED SOME CHANGE AND VARIETY FOR HER
YOU WORE OUT THAT TENDER HEART OF YOURS BEFORE ITS TIME
BY INSTINCT SHE FELT THAT IF HE COULD BUT BE BROUGHT TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN PLAIN WORDS SOMETHING CLEAR WOULD BE GAINED ON WHICH TO ARGUE FOR THE RIGHT AND THE JUST
AND NOW WHAT IS IT NOT
BUT IT MAY HAVE FADED WELL
SHE TORE HER BONNET OFF
THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE THINGS WOULD HAVE GONE ON VERY DIFFERENTLY,--VERY BADLY INDEED
AND NOW CHAPTER XVII WHAT IS A STRIKE
OUT HE CAME
MRS HALE LAY ON THE SOFA HEATED WITH FEVER
IF HOO'L EXCUSE ME LOOKING AT MARGARET FOR BEING I MY STOCKINGS
THE FORESTERS ARE GOING TO TAKE IT DOWN AS SOON AS THE OLD MAN WHO LIVES IN THE OTHER IS DEAD POOR OLD FELLOW
THAT WERE ALL
NO PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT
FOR SHE HAD BEEN SICKLY DYING SO LONG THAT HE HAD PERSUADED HIMSELF SHE WOULD NOT DIE
NO I DON'T SAID MR HALE SEEING HE WAITED FOR SOME KIND OF ASSENT AND COMPLETELY BEWILDERED AS TO WHO THAT MAN COULD BE
MY DEAREST CHILD
AT PRESENT IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF ALL SUBJECTS TENDED TOWARDS MR THORNTON
I LIKE YOU TO BE FANCIFUL ABOUT YOUR MOTHER'S HEALTH
MARGARET COVERED HER UP AND LEFT HER FOR SHE HAD AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE MIGHT BE WANTED AT HOME AND YET UNTIL NOW IT SEEMED CRUEL TO LEAVE THE DYING GIRL
OF COURSE AS YOUR DAUGHTER AS MY GOD-DAUGHTER I TOOK GREAT INTEREST IN HER BEFORE I SAW HER THE LAST TIME
MARGARET TOOK HER HAND DOWN AND LOOKED AT HER MOTHER SADLY
IS THAT THE LETTER IN WHICH HE SPEAKS OF CAPTAIN REID'S IMPATIENCE WITH THE MEN FOR NOT GOING THROUGH THE SHIP'S MANOEUVRES AS QUICKLY AS THE AVENGER
ONE OR TWO THOUGHT THORNTON LOOKED OUT OF SPIRITS
THEREFORE THAT ALL PURCHASERS MUST COME BEFORE THAT HOUR
AND I WILL UNDERTAKE TO IRON YOUR CAPS MAMMA MANY A TIME THAT MORNING DID MARGARET WISH MR THORNTON FAR ENOUGH AWAY
I CAN TELL IT IN THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND AS WELL AS IN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
AND THORNTON WAS AS GOOD TO MANAGE A STRIKE AS ANY ONE
I'LL NOT BE BAULKED OF SAYING HER GOOD-BYE BY ANY RELATIONS WHATSOMDEVER BUT BLESS YO I KNOWED YO'D COME
I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND
MARGARET'S FACE WAS LIGHTENED UP INTO AN HONEST OPEN BRIGHTNESS
SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN
IF YOU WOULD LET US ALONE WE COULD PERHAPS LIKE HER AND SEE HER MERITS I'M SURE I NEVER COULD MURMURED FANNY PROTECTED BY HER MOTHER
YES PERHAPS I MAY
AND BLUE ALWAYS GOES WITH STRAW-COLOUR BUT EDITH HAD BROUGHT THE BRILLIANT SCARLET FLOWERS BEFORE DIXON HAD GOT HALF THROUGH HER REMONSTRANCE
I MEANT THAT THERE SEEMED NO REASON BUT RELIGIOUS ONES WHY YOU SHOULD NOT DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH YOUR OWN
BUT THERE WERE STRONG INTELLECTUAL TASTES AND MUCH AND VARIED KNOWLEDGE WHICH GAVE FLAVOUR TO THE OTHERWISE RATHER INSIPID CONVERSATION
YOU WILL WAKEN YOUR MISTRESS
JUST BEFORE THE FRONT DOOR--WITH MASTER SAID JANE SIGNIFICANTLY
I DARESAY IT SOUNDS VERY BRUTAL
AND PACK UP THE FURNITURE SO THAT IT CAN BE LEFT AT THE RAILWAY STATION TILL WE HAVE MET WITH ONE I SUPPOSE SO
IT WAS SEPARATE FROM THE INTEREST WHICH WAS EXCITED BY WHAT HE SAW
SO THOUGH SHE WAS AFRAID AT THE TIME IT HAS ALL ENDED WELL MISS FANNY GOING TO BE MARRIED EXCLAIMED MARGARET
ONLY I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE TALKED TO YOU OF WHAT I WAS VERY FULL AT THE TIME AND YOU--WHAT MUST I CALL IT THEN?--SPOKE DISRESPECTFULLY OF HELSTONE AS A MERE VILLAGE IN A TALE I WILL NEVER DO SO AGAIN SAID HE WARMLY
YOU WILL FIND HIM AT HIS CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE I WILL WRITE DOWN A LIST OF ALL THE NAMES I CAN REMEMBER ON BOARD THE ORION
WOULD SHE EH MARGARET
THE LAMP THREW A PRETTY LIGHT INTO THE CENTRE OF THE DUSKY ROOM FROM WHICH WITH COUNTRY HABITS THEY DID NOT EXCLUDE THE NIGHT-SKIES AND THE OUTER DARKNESS OF AIR
I COME FROM THE SOUTH--FROM HAMPSHIRE SHE CONTINUED A LITTLE AFRAID OF WOUNDING HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF IGNORANCE IF SHE USED A NAME WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
TO BE SURE NICHOLAS HIGGINS THE FATHER SPOKE DIFFERENTLY
THEN SHE SAID RATHER GRAVELY
HE RATHER SEEMED TO REGRET THE PAST AND BE WEARY OF THE PRESENT
MANY A TIME DID MARGARET REPENT OF HAVING SUGGESTED AND URGED ON THE PLAN OF CONSULTING MR LENNOX
I WAS STARTLED
EVERYTHING REFLECTED LIGHT NOTHING ABSORBED IT
IT WAS HASTY ENOUGH BUT PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY
HE GLANCED AT MARGARET STANDING ALL BY HERSELF AT THE WINDOW NEAREST THE FACTORY
HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
HE HAD CHOSEN ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE AS HIS SUBJECT RATHER MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN TASTE AND KNOWLEDGE THAN AS FALLING IN WITH THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE OR THE DESIRE FOR PARTICULAR KINDS OF INFORMATION AMONG THOSE TO WHOM HE WAS TO LECTURE
THE WORDS SWAM BEFORE HER
MUCH YO KNOW ABOUT IT
LIFT UP YOUR HEAD
WHY IT SEEMS A WEEK AGO
THE CHILDREN KNEW MORE THAN SHE DID
GOD KNOWS I SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO TAKE THE ALARM IF YOUR MOTHER WERE REALLY ILL
THE COTTAGE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN AND A NEW ONE TIDY AND RESPECTABLE HAD BEEN BUILT IN ITS STEAD
AND HE AND T OTHER COMMITTEE-MEN LAID THEIR PLANS
BRAVE WEATHER THIS
NOUGHT CAN HURT HER NOW THEN RAISING HIS VOICE TO A WAILING CRY HE WENT ON
I'M SORE VEXED WI HIM JUST NOW
SHE DID NOT MIND MEETING ANY NUMBER OF GIRLS LOUD SPOKEN AND BOISTEROUS THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE
MARGARET DID NOT CARE A STRAW ABOUT SEEING THE ALTERATIONS WHICH JARRED UPON HER FOND RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HER HOME HAD BEEN
HOW FULL HIS THOUGHTS WERE OF HER ALL LAST NIGHT
HERE IT IS SHE COULD NOT SEE TO READ IT--NO NOT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS CLOSE TO THE CANDLE
IF YOU LIVE IN MILTON YOU MUST LEARN TO HAVE A BRAVE HEART MISS HALE I WOULD DO MY BEST SAID MARGARET RATHER PALE
I AM TOO OLD TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH THE SAME HEART
YOU GET NO MORE OF ME
IT'S A NECESSITY NOW ACCORDING TO ME
NO DEAR
NO DEAR
AND RUMMAGED UP NUMBERLESS SMALL SUBJECTS FOR CONVERSATION--ALL EXCEPT THE RIOT AND THAT SHE NEVER NAMED ONCE
ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE
POOR OLD FRIEND
WHAT A PITY SUCH A NATURE SHOULD BE TAINTED BY HIS POSITION AS A MILTON MANUFACTURER HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
I WAS THINKING OF ASKING THE PORTERS AS THE BROWNS CAN'T COME VERY GOOD
HER ONLY REGRET WAS THAT MR HALE COULD NOT BE WITH HER ALL THE FORTNIGHT SHE WAS TO BE THERE AS HE HAD BEEN FOR A WHOLE FORTNIGHT ONCE WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGED AND SHE WAS STAYING WITH SIR JOHN AND LADY BERESFORD AT TORQUAY
A LETTER FROM HIM MIGHT NOW BE EXPECTED ANY DAY
BUT THAT IS NOT IT
ONE MORNING WHEN DAYLIGHT WAS STEALING IN THROUGH THE CREVICES OF HIS SHUTTERS AND HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN BED AND IN HOPELESS INDIFFERENCE OF MIND WAS THINKING THAT HE COULD DO WITHOUT THE HOUR OR TWO OF REST WHICH WAS ALL THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE BEFORE THE STIR OF DAILY LABOUR BEGAN AGAIN THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM OPENED AND HIS MOTHER STOOD THERE DRESSED AS SHE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE
I'LL NOT BE BEAT BY IT THOUGH
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME MISS HALE BUT IT IS--IN SPITE OF THE PERSECUTION I'M AFRAID I THREATENED YOU WITH AT ONE TIME--BUT THAT IS ALL GIVEN UP
THEIR FATHERS GROUND OUR FATHERS TO THE VERY DUST
NOW IN THE SOUTH WE HAVE OUR POOR BUT THERE IS NOT THAT TERRIBLE EXPRESSION IN THEIR COUNTENANCES OF A SULLEN SENSE OF INJUSTICE WHICH I SEE HERE
ONLY AS I HAVE NEITHER HUSBAND NOR CHILD TO GIVE ME NATURAL DUTIES I MUST MAKE MYSELF SOME IN ADDITION TO ORDERING MY GOWNS IN THE FAMILY CONCLAVE WHICH WAS MADE UP OF EDITH HER MOTHER AND HER HUSBAND IT WAS DECIDED THAT PERHAPS ALL THESE PLANS OF HERS WOULD ONLY SECURE HER THE MORE FOR HENRY LENNOX
WHO HAS BEEN TELLING YOU SUCH NONSENSE PAPA HIMSELF SAID MARGARET LONGING TO SAY SOMETHING GENTLE AND CONSOLING BUT LITERALLY NOT KNOWING HOW
BESSY WAS ROCKING HERSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE
HE'S LIKER A WEED LOUNGING OVER THE GROUND--MUN JUST MAKE UP THEIR MIND TO BE PUT OUT O THE WAY
SHE DREW A DEEP BREATH
BUT NOW IT WAS TIME TO DRAW HER BACK TO MR LENNOX
HE IS ON LAND NOW SO WIND CAN DO HIM NO HARM
SHALL WE GO IN ASKED HER FATHER
SHE HAD BRACED HERSELF UP MANY AND MANY A TIME AT SOME SUDDEN NOISE IN THE HOUSE
HE WAS IN THE CHARYBDIS OF PASSION AND MUST PERFORCE CIRCLE AND CIRCLE EVER NEARER ROUND THE FATAL CENTRE
I COULD NOT READ IT
IF HE HAD KNOWN IT HE COULD HAVE SANG THE SONG OF THE MILLER WHO LIVED BY THE RIVER DEE I CARE FOR NOBODY NOBODY CARES FOR ME THE EVIDENCE AGAINST BOUCHER AND OTHER RINGLEADERS OF THE RIOT WAS TAKEN BEFORE HIM
PEOPLE THRONGED THE FOOTPATHS MOST OF THEM WELL-DRESSED AS REGARDED THE MATERIAL BUT WITH A SLOVENLY LOOSENESS WHICH STRUCK MARGARET AS DIFFERENT FROM THE SHABBY THREADBARE SMARTNESS OF A SIMILAR CLASS IN LONDON
I DON'T SUPPOSE HIS EDUCATION WOULD FIT HIM FOR MUCH ELSE MARGARET LIFTED HERSELF SLOWLY UP AND WENT TO HER OWN ROOM
MANY A ONE IS NOT WELL FOR A TIME
PERHAPS THAT WILL BE BEST SO OFF MARGARET WENT
AND BEHIND THE GREAT SHEET OF THE OUTSPREAD TIMES HE RECOGNISED MR THORNTON
LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT
YOU THERE STILL AY SIR
HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND THEN HE BRUSHED HIS LEAN HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND WENT HIS WAY
OH MARGARET
OH MARGARET
OH MARGARET
OH MARGARET
OH MARGARET
AND NOW THE BATTLE IS PRETTY FAIRLY WAGED BETWEEN US
I HAVE HEERD THEY'RE A PACK OF SPIRITLESS DOWN-TRODDEN MEN
PRESENTLY HE OPENED THE ROOM-DOOR AND STOOD THERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO COME IN
DEAR DARLING MAMMA
I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT WOMAN WAS SITTING THERE IN SUCH A DOLEFUL ATTITUDE WITH HER HANDS CLASPED STRAIGHT OUT UPON HER KNEES AND HER FACE LOOKING SO STEADFASTLY BEFORE HER
SOMEBODY TOOK HER DOWN TO DINNER
THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE I LOVE
BUT I REALLY AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR EXONERATING ME FROM MAKING ANY PLANS ON MR THORNTON'S HEART YOUNG LADIES HAVE BEFORE NOW SAID MRS THORNTON STIFFLY
WHY THEY TOOK NOUNS THAT WERE SIGNS OF THINGS WHICH GAVE EVIDENCE OF WEALTH,--HOUSEKEEPERS UNDER-GARDENERS EXTENT OF GLASS VALUABLE LACE DIAMONDS AND ALL SUCH THINGS
SPEAK TO THEM KINDLY
SHE LAY LIKE ONE DEAD ON MR THORNTON'S SHOULDER
THE FIRST ROOM IN THAT HOUSE WITH WHICH SHE HAD BECOME FAMILIAR NINE YEARS AGO WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT ALL UNTAMED FROM THE FOREST TO SHARE THE HOME THE PLAY AND THE LESSONS OF HER COUSIN EDITH
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA OF THE HEAT HERE
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW WHAT A KNOBSTICK IS NOT I CHILD
NOW MARLBOROUGH STREET CONSISTED OF LONG ROWS OF SMALL HOUSES WITH A BLANK WALL HERE AND THERE
ONCE OR TWICE ON SUNDAYS SHE SAW HIM WALKING WITH A GIRL EVIDENTLY HIS DAUGHTER AND IF POSSIBLE STILL MORE UNHEALTHY THAN HE WAS HIMSELF
I NEVER WAS FAINTHEARTED BEFORE
INDEED I CANNOT
SHE COULD HARDLY GET HIM TO TALK ALTHOUGH SHE TRIED TO SPEAK ON SUBJECTS THAT WOULD INTEREST HIM AT THE COST OF AN EFFORT EVERY TIME WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE HER LAST
YOU COULD GO ON THERE WHILE I AM AT MRS HALE'S OH
SENSELESS AND PURPOSELESS WERE WOOD AND IRON AND STEAM IN THEIR ENDLESS LABOURS
BUT FOR ALL THAT--FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE WORDS HE COULD HAVE THROWN HIMSELF AT HER FEET AND KISSED THE HEM OF HER GARMENT
COME PAPA SHE DID NOT BREATHE FREELY TILL THEY WERE SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
BUT ALL LAWS WHICH DEPEND FOR THEIR ENFORCEMENT UPON INFORMERS AND FINES BECOME INERT FROM THE ODIOUSNESS OF THE MACHINERY
YOU'RE A GOOD FELLOW AFTER ALL THORNTON
A QUIET HOUR OR TWO BEFORE A LATE BREAKFAST
YOU DID NOT LOOK PLEASED AT WHAT SHIRLEY WAS SAYING AT DINNER DIDN'T I
THORNTON'S IS NOT A BAD MILL AS TIMES GO
WHEN MR THORNTON HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THAT MORNING HE WAS ALMOST BLINDED BY HIS BAFFLED PASSION
IT WOULD NOT BE SO REFRESHING AS A QUIET COUNTRY WALK BUT STILL IT WOULD PERHAPS BE DOING THE KINDER THING
EXCESSIVELY PLEASED
IT IS THERE--THERE COWERING AND GIBBERING WITH FIXED GHASTLY EYES IN SOME CORNER OF THE CHAMBER LISTENING TO HEAR WHETHER WE DARE TO BREATHE OF ITS PRESENCE TO ANY ONE
MARGARET'S HEART ACHED AT HIS RESTLESSNESS--HIS TRYING TO STIFLE AND STRANGLE THE HIDEOUS FEAR THAT WAS LOOMING OUT OF THE DARK PLACES OF HIS HEART
HOW EVERY WORD TOLD
BUT HE SAID IF YOU WISH IT MARGARET
I TAKE CHANGES IN ALL I SEE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MRS THORNTON'S FEELINGS
I'M SURE MA'AM IT'S A GREAT WEIGHT OFF MY MIND
IMPELLED THITHER--NOT BY A POOR CURIOSITY BUT AS IF BY SOME SOLEMN BLAST
IF HE HAD BUT KNOWN HOW MARGARET WOULD HAVE BECOME INVOLVED IN THE AFFAIR--IF HE HAD BUT FORESEEN THAT SHE WOULD HAVE STAINED HER WHITENESS BY A FALSEHOOD HE COULD HAVE SAVED HER BY A WORD
I FORESEE TROUBLE FOR THAT GIRL--PERHAPS WANT OF MOTHERLY CARE--AND I ONLY WISH YOU TO BE READY TO BE A FRIEND TO HER IN CASE SHE NEEDS ONE
HER FATHER'S LOOKS BECAME MORE GRAVE AND ANXIOUS
YOU'D BETTER TURN TO SOMETHING ELSE IF YOU'VE ANY SUCH GOOD INTENTION IN YOUR HEAD
AND HE WENT OFF AT THE FRONT DOOR HE'S AT THE NEAREST VAULTS I'LL BE BOUND SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER
I DO BELIEVE HE IS HER LOVER WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE TURNED ROUND AGAIN
IT IS SO INDEED
HE UNDERSTOOD HER AND TOOK HER OFFERED HAND
HE WRITHED HIMSELF ABOUT LIKE ONE IN BODILY PAIN
AND YET I MUST SPEAK CHEERFULLY TO MY FATHER WHO HAS NO NOTION OF HER REAL STATE AND TO WHOM THE KNOWLEDGE MUST COME GRADUALLY
IT WAS AS IF FROM SOME AERIAL BELFRY HIGH UP ABOVE THE STIR AND JAR OF THE EARTH THERE WAS A BELL CONTINUALLY TOLLING ALL ARE SHADOWS!--ALL ARE PASSING!--ALL IS PAST AND WHEN THE MORNING DAWNED COOL AND GRAY LIKE MANY A HAPPIER MORNING BEFORE--WHEN MARGARET LOOKED ONE BY ONE AT THE SLEEPERS IT SEEMED AS IF THE TERRIBLE NIGHT WERE UNREAL AS A DREAM
JELLY IS MUCH THE BIGGEST BUT POWDER TASTES IT ALL THROUGH
THEY CARRIED A DOOR TAKEN OFF ITS HINGES UPON THEIR SHOULDERS ON WHICH LAY SOME DEAD HUMAN CREATURE
AT LEAST THEY SAY IT'S DOING GOOD
HE FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT THESE LAST TWO SENTENCES HE SPOKE LOW AS IF TO HIMSELF
THE MORE SHE WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT HIM THE LESS LIKELY SHE WAS TO SPEAK
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH NO ONE HAD BEEN IN IT SINCE THE DAY WHEN THE FURNITURE WAS BAGGED UP WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF THE HOUSE WAS TO BE OVERWHELMED WITH LAVA AND DISCOVERED A THOUSAND YEARS HENCE
I'M SICK ON IT
WERE DUTCH DAMASK OF THE OLD KIND EXQUISITELY FINE
MRS THORNTON HAD SAT IN THE DINING-ROOM ALL DAY EVERY MOMENT EXPECTING THE NEWS OF HER SON'S ACCEPTANCE BY MISS HALE
WHY DUN YO STARE AT ME WI YOUR GREAT PITIFUL EYES
THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
I DON'T ANALYSE MY FEELINGS I AM CONTENT TO TAKE YOUR LIKING ME WITHOUT EXAMINING TOO CURIOUSLY INTO THE MATERIALS IT IS MADE OF
I WON'T
THE PATTERN ON THE CARPET REPRESENTED BUNCHES OF FLOWERS ON A LIGHT GROUND BUT IT WAS CAREFULLY COVERED UP IN THE CENTRE BY A LINEN DRUGGET GLAZED AND COLOURLESS
SO DIFFERENT AS SHE SAID FROM THE OLD DOWAGER DINNERS UNDER MAMMA'S REGIME AND MRS SHAW HERSELF SEEMED TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF PLEASURE IN THE VERY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS AND CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCES WHICH WERE TO CAPTAIN AND MRS LENNOX'S TASTE AS SHE DID IN THE MORE FORMAL AND PONDEROUS ENTERTAINMENTS WHICH SHE HERSELF USED TO GIVE
SHE HAD LISTENED PATIENTLY IN HOPES THAT IT MIGHT BE SOME RELIEF TO HER MOTHER TO UNBURDEN HERSELF
WOMEN OF OUR CLASS DON'T GO BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO POWER OVER THEIR EMOTIONS AND YET ARE ASHAMED OF SHOWING THEM
WHERE WAS HE
HE DID YOU NO GOOD
SO MAPPEN I DUNNOT SPEAK HIM FAIR
STRONG MAN AS HE WAS HE TREMBLED AT THE ANTICIPATION OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND HOW IT MIGHT BE RECEIVED
THAT NIGHT MR HALE LAID HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE PILLOW ON WHICH IT NEVER MORE SHOULD STIR WITH LIFE
HE CAME TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE IN HIS POWER I BELIEVE
SEE IF WE DON'T DANG TH MASTERS THIS TIME
BUT SHE HAD THE SPELL BY WHICH TO ROUSE HIM
AND WE'EN TOO MUCH BLOOD IN US TO STAND IT
DO YOU KNOW MARGARET DIXON AND I THOUGHT YOU WOULD QUITE SHRINK FROM ME IF YOU KNEW DIXON THOUGHT SAID MARGARET HER LIP CURLING
TO BE SURE I CAN
BUT THIS THOUGHT WAS NO CONSOLATION TO MR THORNTON
AND IT WAS PAST FOUR WHEN HE WAS HERE IT WAS MR THORNTON SAID MR HALE
GO DOWN TO HER FANNY AND DO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF OF USE
HE WENT ALONG THE CROWDED STREETS MECHANICALLY WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE PEOPLE BUT NEVER SEEING THEM,--ALMOST SICK WITH LONGING FOR THAT ONE HALF-HOUR--THAT ONE BRIEF SPACE OF TIME WHEN SHE CLUNG TO HIM AND HER HEART BEAT AGAINST HIS--TO COME ONCE AGAIN
HE MUST KNOW OF THE GROWING ANGER AND HARDLY SMOTHERED HATRED OF HIS WORKPEOPLE WHO ALL LOOK UPON HIM AS WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS A HARD MAN,"--NOT SO MUCH UNJUST AS UNFEELING
I MAINTAIN THAT DESPOTISM IS THE BEST KIND OF GOVERNMENT FOR THEM
BUT COURAGE LITTLE HEART
AND MR HALE IMAGINED THAT THE PROMISED SOCIETY OF HIS OLD OXFORD FRIEND WOULD GIVE AS AGREEABLE A TURN TO MARGARET'S IDEAS AS IT DID TO HIS OWN
NOT HE MR THORNTON WAS RIGHT SAID MARGARET
SHE IS ALIVE THANK GOD SAID HE
EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF-WHISPER AS SHE ROSE TO ACCOMPANY HER MOTHER WHO WAS TAKING LEAVE OF MRS HALE WITH RUSTLING DIGNITY
MARGARET SPOKE NO MORE DURING THE LESSON
AND THEREFORE IF THERE IS ANY SERIOUS APPREHENSION IT MUST BE BROKEN TO HIM GENTLY
OUT IT CAME AT LAST MY DEAR
MARGARET'S CONSCIOUS ASSUMPTION OF THIS UNUSUAL DIGNITY OF DEMEANOUR TOWARDS DIXON GAVE HER AN INSTANT'S AMUSEMENT IN THE MIDST OF HER ANXIETY
I FEAR THERE ARE
HE WOULD NOT LEAVE HER EVEN FOR THE DINNER WHICH DIXON HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DOWN-STAIRS AND WITH SOBBING HOSPITALITY WOULD FAIN HAVE TEMPTED HIM TO EAT
HE STARTED FORWARDS HOWEVER TO HAND MRS SHAW DOWN TO THE CARRIAGE
IT IS NECESSARY OF COURSE FOR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE VERY STRINGENT MEASURES FOR THE REPRESSION OF OFFENCES AGAINST AUTHORITY MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE NAVY WHERE A COMMANDING OFFICER NEEDS TO BE SURROUNDED IN HIS MEN'S EYES WITH A VIVID CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THE POWER THERE IS AT HOME TO BACK HIM AND TAKE UP HIS CAUSE AND AVENGE ANY INJURIES OFFERED TO HIM IF NEED BE
THE WHOLE TONE OF IT ANNOYED HER
HERE A SPECTATOR OR TWO STOOD LOUNGING AT NEARLY EVERY STATION WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS SO ABSORBED IN THE SIMPLE ACT OF WATCHING THAT IT MADE THE TRAVELLERS WONDER WHAT HE COULD FIND TO DO WHEN THE TRAIN WHIRLED AWAY AND ONLY THE BLANK OF A RAILWAY SOME SHEDS AND A DISTANT FIELD OR TWO WERE LEFT FOR HIM TO GAZE UPON
BUT STILL THEY SEEMED TO DEFY THE OLD LIMITS OF POSSIBILITY IN A KIND OF FINE INTOXICATION CAUSED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACHIEVED AND WHAT YET SHOULD BE
SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED
AND A HEART AT LEISURE FROM ITSELF TO SOOTHE AND SYMPATHISE ANON
A BROTHER OF HER AUNT'S NO NO
IT IS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO--WOULD THEY STILL PROSECUTE HIM MOTHER
JOHN SHOULD NA HA LEFT ME AND ME SO POORLY HOW LONG IS IT SINCE HE WENT AWAY FOUR DAYS SIN NO ONE WOULD GIVE HIM WORK HERE AND HE'D TO GO ON TRAMP TOWARD GREENFIELD
THAT'S WHAT FOLK CALL FINE AND HONOURABLE IN A SOLDIER AND WHY NOT IN A POOR WEAVER-CHAP BUT SAID MARGARET A SOLDIER DIES IN THE CAUSE OF THE NATION--IN THE CAUSE OF OTHERS HE LAUGHED GRIMLY
POOR BOY HE SAID AND TOOK NO MORE NOTICE
OH DON'T LET US HAVE THESE FORMS SAID SHE
AND HER READINESS AND MARGARET'S SWEET FORBEARANCE SOON MADE DIXON ASHAMED OF HERSELF
BUT I AM STRIVING TO BE SO NO LONGER
BUT THE THING MUST BE NEVERTHELESS
IT WAS A MR HALE'S I BELIEVE YES SAID MR THORNTON TURNING SHARP ROUND AND LOOKING INTO THE INSPECTOR'S FACE WITH SUDDEN INTEREST
MARGARET SMILED A LITTLE AND THEN SIGHED AS SHE REMEMBERED AFRESH HER OLD TIRADES AGAINST TRADE
SO HE WENT ON
THIS STRIKE WHICH AFFECTS ME MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN MILTON,--MORE THAN HAMPER,--NEVER COMES NEAR MY APPETITE
WE ARE BUILDING A NURSERY OUT OF YOUR ROOM I BELIEVE
NO HOPE
THE D D FOOL WHO HAS PUT HIS FOOT IN ALL OUR PLANS
HE TOOK SUDDEN HOLD OF MARGARET'S ARM AND HELD HER TILL HE COULD GATHER WORDS TO SPEAK SEEMED DRY
MINE WERE ALTERED BY MY OWN WILL BEFORE PARLIAMENT MEDDLED WITH THE AFFAIR
I DID NOT HEAR YOU COME INTO THE ROOM SAID MARGARET RESUMING HER TREMBLING SELF-RESTRAINT
SHE COULD SCARCELY COMMAND HERSELF ENOUGH TO SAY OH THE FOGS IN LONDON ARE SOMETIMES FAR WORSE BUT THEN YOU KNEW THAT LONDON ITSELF AND FRIENDS LAY BEHIND IT
I AM NOT EASY NOR CONTENT EITHER
HE REMEMBERED POINT BY POINT THE SHARPNESS OF HER WORDS--'THERE WAS NOT A MAN IN ALL THAT CROWD FOR WHOM SHE WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AS MUCH FAR MORE READILY THAN FOR HIM HE SHARED WITH THE MOB IN HER DESIRE OF AVERTING BLOODSHED FROM THEM
ALL THE MORE COURTEOUSLY AND GRACIOUSLY BECAUSE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT BY HER BEHAVIOUR HE MIGHT HAVE PROBABLY BEEN LED TO IMAGINE THAT HE HAD GIVEN HER NEEDLESS PAIN
IT WAS THE POLICE-INSPECTOR
BUT IT IS A LONG WAY
WHEN MARGARET HAD DULY APPLAUDED NICHOLAS CALLED FOR ANOTHER AND YET ANOTHER MUCH TO HER SURPRISE AS SHE FOUND HIM THUS ODDLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY LED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE SACRED THINGS WHICH HE HAD FORMERLY SCOUTED
SHE WENT TO HIM AND THREW HERSELF ON HIS BREAST CRYING OUT OH
IT WAS ONLY THE LAST TIME MR THORNTON WAS HERE THAT HE SAID THOSE WERE NO TRUE FRIENDS WHO HELPED TO PROLONG THE STRUGGLE BY ASSISTING THE TURN OUTS
MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
IF HE SHOULD BE TAKEN
AND THE TWO BEGAN TO TALK IN A SUBDUED TONE
I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF--YOU BUT AS A FRIEND
PAPA WILL YOU SPEAK TO THE MEN AND GET THEM TO GO AWAY
THERE WAS NO UNDERSTANDING HIM HE WAS SO PARTICULAR
A MORE HELPLESS NERVELESS ATTITUDE AND ANOTHER YES BUT BEFORE HER FATHER COULD SPEAK MARGARET LIFTED UP HER FACE ROSY WITH SOME BEAUTIFUL SHAME AND FIXING HER EYES UPON HIM SAID
HER HUSBAND HAD TO ATTEND DRILL AND SHE THE MOST MUSICAL OFFICER'S WIFE THERE HAD TO COPY THE NEW AND POPULAR TUNES OUT OF THE MOST RECENT ENGLISH MUSIC FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BANDMASTER
MONEY DEAR FATHER THAT I HAD MEANT FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE
NOT OVER-BRUSHED NOR OVER-POLISHED IT MUST BE CONFESSED AFTER HIS ROUGH ENCOUNTER WITH MILTON STREETS AND CROWDS
MISS HALE BEARS UP BETTER THAN LIKELY MR THORNTON WOULD RATHER HAVE HEARD THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING THE NATURAL SORROW
IN SOME REMOTE APARTMENT THERE WAS EXERCISE UPON THE PIANO GOING ON
I CANNOT BE PATIENT HERE
HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS THAT HER MOTHER SLEPT
SHE HAD NEVER LAID HERSELF DOWN TO SLUMBER ANY MORE THAN HE
HE'S NE'ER OUT O MISCHIEF THAT MAN
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CONTROL THEMSELVES
AND I WERE KNOCKED DOWN BY ONE WHO TELLED ME SHE WERE DEAD--JUST DEAD
THE MOUTH--A LITTLE WHILE AGO SO SULLENLY PROJECTED IN DEFIANCE--WAS RELAXED AND LIVID
YOU CAN'T KNOW HOW STRONG A TEMPTATION IT WAS
NO NOT MY KIND FOR LOVE FOR MY SPECIES COULD NEVER FILL MY HEART TO THE UTTER EXCLUSION OF LOVE FOR INDIVIDUALS
I'VE HAD A GREAT MIND TO DO IT MYSELF
BUT I AM SO GLAD
AND THE THOUGHT OF THEM HAD STRUCK UPON HER FANCY
MRS THORNTON GREW IMPATIENT
NO MOTHER AND ME AT THE MILL TILL I WERE GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT SCOLDING HER FOR DOING BADLY WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO A BIT
SHE MADE HER BODY INTO A SHIELD FROM THE FIERCE PEOPLE BEYOND
AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
HE GAZED BACK AT HER FOR A MINUTE AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER MASTER CAN HELP YOURSELVES
HE WAS STARTLED BY THE SENSE OF THE PRESENCE OF SOME ONE ELSE IN THE ROOM
HER VOICE NEVER FALTERED
MR HENRY LENNOX STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEY-PIECE AMUSED WITH THE FAMILY SCENE
SHE IS VERY ILL
MRS HALE LIFTED HERSELF UP FROM A DOZE
MOREOVER IF SHE GAVE WAY WHO WAS TO ACT
BUT HE PUSHED HER AWAY--GENTLY ENOUGH BUT STILL AS IF SHE HAD SUGGESTED UNPLEASANT IDEAS WHICH HE SHOULD BE GLAD TO GET RID OF AS READILY AS HE COULD OF HER PRESENCE
AND THEY TELL STRANGE TALES OF THE WILD EXTRAVAGANCE OF LIVING INDULGED IN ON GALA-DAYS BY THOSE EARLY COTTON-LORDS
DO YOU GO TO BED AND SLEEP LIKE A TOP
SEE WHAT IT HAS BROUGHT HIM TO
BUT UNCONSCIOUSLY MARGARET HAD IMAGINED THAT TALL MASSIVE HANDSOMELY DRESSED MRS THORNTON MUST LIVE IN A HOUSE OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HERSELF
I REALLY THINK EDITH OWES ME THANKS FOR MY CONTRIBUTION TO HER PARTY
LET THEM
AND MRS THORNTON AND MR THORNTON TOO THEY NEVER RESTED TILL THEY HAD NURSED ME UP IN THEIR OWN HOUSE AND SENT ME TO THE SEA AND ALL
SO BETWEEN MASTERS AND MEN TH WHEELS FALL THROUGH
BUT AT LAST HE MOVED TOWARDS THE STAIRS
BUT MOTHER CONTINUED HE STOPPING SHORT IN HIS WALK RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER I DARE NOT HOPE
ONE WOULD THINK IT WAS EASY ENOUGH
NO YOU CAN'T MARGARET
NOT THE DISEASE
WHAT IS THIS
MRS THORNTON HAS ONE I KNOW
THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
BUT NOT BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT I HAD SAID
OFFENDS YOU
THE LARGE PLEADING DILATED EYES WERE FIXED UPON HER WISTFULLY STEADY IN THEIR GAZE THOUGH THE POOR WHITE LIPS QUIVERED LIKE THOSE OF A CHILD
I KNOW SO VERY FEW THERE WAS NO SPAIN FOR MARGARET THAT AUTUMN
AT THE TIME ARRANGED THE PREVIOUS DAY THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WALK TO SEE NICHOLAS HIGGINS AND HIS DAUGHTER
MY MASTER HAMPER
THEN SHE PENETRATED FARTHER INTO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
BUT THE RETROGRADE MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE GATE HAD BEGUN--AS UNREASONINGLY PERHAPS AS BLINDLY AS THE SIMULTANEOUS ANGER
BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER,--EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
BUT I DON'T THINK WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AT ALL IN THAT WAY I NEVER THOUGHT YO'D BE DINING WITH THORNTONS REPEATED I BESSY
POOR FRED
POOR FRED
MARGARET SAID SOMETHING SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HER THROAT AND MOUTH WERE SO DRY AND THE CHILDREN'S NOISE COMPLETELY PREVENTED HER FROM BEING HEARD
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR IT IS ALWAYS THE SAVAGE LADS WITH THEIR LOVE OF CRUEL EXCITEMENT WHO HEAD THE RIOT--RECKLESS TO WHAT BLOODSHED IT MAY LEAD
THE THOUGHT OF THIS PERPETUALLY STUNG HIM
DID THEY THROW STONES INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM MARGARET DID INDEED LOOK WHITE AND WAN ALTHOUGH HER SENSES WERE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO HER
HE WAS RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS TWO HANDS AND LOOKING DOWN INTO THE FIRE SO SHE COULD NOT READ THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
MARY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR HER WITH A HALF-DISTRUSTFUL FACE
AS SOON AS THEY SAW MR THORNTON THEY SET UP A YELL,--TO CALL IT NOT HUMAN IS NOTHING,--IT WAS AS THE DEMONIAC DESIRE OF SOME TERRIBLE WILD BEAST FOR THE FOOD THAT IS WITHHELD FROM HIS RAVENING
AT PRESENT ALL THOSE WHO KNEW YOU FORMERLY BELIEVE YOU GUILTY WITHOUT ANY SHADOW OF EXCUSE
HOME MISS
MR THORNTON'S SAID MARGARET
THE MIGHTY FALL OF THE PONDEROUS GATES
I HAVE A HEADACHE TO-DAY AND I SHAN'T GO OUT MR THORNTON LOOKED ANNOYED
THEY FELL BACK INTO THEIR USUAL MODE OF TALK,--ABOUT FACTS NOT OPINIONS FAR LESS FEELINGS
AS FAR AS LOVE MAY GO SHE MAY BE WORTHY OF YOU
BUT HERE HAVE I BEEN DISPLACED AND TURNED OUT OF MY POST OF COMFORTER AND ADVISER BY A FINE LADY AUNT
I NEVER HAD ANY HOPE OF CURE AS I THINK I TOLD YOU
FANNY CAME IN AT LAST
BUT I PROMISE YOU PAPA THAT IF YOU WILL LET ME GO I WILL BE NO TROUBLE
DON'T MIND WHAT I SAY
YOU HAVE SO FEW FRIENDS HERE MARGARET MARGARET FELT WHAT WAS IN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS,--A TENDER CRAVING TO BESPEAK THE KINDNESS OF SOME WOMAN TOWARDS THE DAUGHTER THAT MIGHT BE SO SOON LEFT MOTHERLESS
WHERE'S JOHN WEAK AS SHE WAS SHE SHOOK MARGARET TO FORCE OUT AN ANSWER
AGAIN STEPPING NEARER HE BESOUGHT HER WITH ANOTHER TREMULOUS EAGER CALL UPON HER NAME
RECOLLECT HOW YOU RATHER SCORNED MY DESCRIPTION OF IT ONE EVENING IN HARLEY STREET
HE WAS SAID MARGARET SHORTLY
SO THE MANNER WAS SUBDUED TO A QUIET DELIBERATION BUT THE MATTER WAS EVEN HARDER AND STERNER THAN COMMON
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A MAN IN MILTON WHO KNOWS HOW TO SIT STILL
MR HALE CAME IN AS HE THOUGHT TO THE RESCUE
I MIGHT HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY AND ACTED MORE WISELY IN ALL THAT I SUBSEQUENTLY DID FOR MY FAMILY
BUT YOU KNOW I AM BUT AN UNCOUTH MILTON MANUFACTURER
SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME OTHER ADVICE--SOME LONDON DOCTOR
HIS SYMPATHY
ALL PASSED AWAY
I THOUGH A MASTER MAY BE OPPRESSED)--THAT MADE YOU ACT SO NOBLY AS YOU DID
AND MARGARET APPLIED HERSELF TO LIGHT IT FOR THE EVENINGS HAD BEGUN TO BE CHILLY
SHE WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT DR DONALDSON'S EARLY VISIT AND PERPLEXED BY THE ANXIOUS FACES OF HUSBAND AND CHILD
THE LINES IN THE FACE WERE FEW BUT FIRM AS IF THEY WERE CARVED IN MARBLE AND LAY PRINCIPALLY ABOUT THE LIPS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY COMPRESSED OVER A SET OF TEETH SO FAULTLESS AND BEAUTIFUL AS TO GIVE THE EFFECT OF SUDDEN SUNLIGHT WHEN THE RARE BRIGHT SMILE COMING IN AN INSTANT AND SHINING OUT OF THE EYES CHANGED THE WHOLE LOOK FROM THE SEVERE AND RESOLVED EXPRESSION OF A MAN READY TO DO AND DARE EVERYTHING TO THE KEEN HONEST ENJOYMENT OF THE MOMENT WHICH IS SELDOM SHOWN SO FEARLESSLY AND INSTANTANEOUSLY EXCEPT BY CHILDREN
WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW MR HALE COULD HAVE BORNE COMING TO REVISIT HELSTONE IF IT HAD BEEN AS THE VICAR'S LADY SUPPOSED
HOW SHALL I BEAR TO SEE THEM
IT MAKES MY HEAD SO HOT
YOU MUST GO TO BED DIRECTLY
I DID NO MORE THAN I BELIEVED TO BE MY DUTY IN REMONSTRATING WITH YOU AS I DID
MARGARET'S HEART ACHED WITHIN HER
WHERE DO YOU LIVE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO RESIDE MISS HALE
I WANT TO THANK HER FOR THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STOOD BETWEEN ME AND THE MOB WHAT MADE YOU GO DOWN AT ALL
SHE HAS GOT TO NAPLES AND FINDS IT TOO HOT SO SHE HAS TAKEN APARTMENTS AT SORRENTO
OH MY GOD MY GOD
THAT WE CANNOT TELL
THEY DO SAY TRADE HAS BEEN GOOD FOR LONG AND THE MASTERS HAS MADE NO END O MONEY
MRS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MRS THORNTON WORE
I SHOULD ALWAYS BE FANCYING SOME ONE HAD KNOWN HIM AND THAT HE HAD BEEN STOPPED UNLESS YOU COULD TELL ME YOU HAD SEEN HIM OFF
NO ONE CAN WHO DID NOT SEE HIM THEN
HE HAD DELICATE FEATURES REDEEMED FROM EFFEMINACY BY THE SWARTHINESS OF HIS COMPLEXION AND HIS QUICK INTENSITY OF EXPRESSION
UTTERLY NONE AT ALL
THEY WOULD BRING BACK THE SCENE,--NOT OF HIS REPULSE AND REJECTION THE DAY BEFORE BUT THE LOOKS THE ACTIONS OF THE DAY BEFORE THAT
AND THESE WERE THE MEN WHO THOUGHT THEMSELVES FITTED TO DIRECT THE MASTERS IN THE DISPOSAL OF THEIR CAPITAL
WHICH SHOWED A FATAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOMETHING WRONG AND TO BE CONCEALED WHICH WAS UNLIKE HER
NOW FOR MISS BARBOUR'S SAKE MAKE YOUR CONDUCT AS CLEAR AS YOU CAN IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD
NEWS WAS SOUGHT FOR WITH FIERCE AVIDITY
I CAN BELIEVE SHE HAS HAD A STRUGGLE WITH HER ARISTOCRATIC WAY OF VIEWING THINGS
BUT SHE HAD A REPUGNANCE TO THE IDEA OF A MANUFACTURING TOWN AND BELIEVED THAT HER MOTHER WAS RECEIVING BENEFIT FROM HESTON AIR SO SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DEFERRED THE EXPEDITION TO MILTON
SUDDENLY IT STRUCK HER THAT THIS WAS A STRANGE MANNER TO SHOW HER PATIENCE OR TO REWARD HER FATHER FOR HIS WATCHFUL CARE OF HER ALL THROUGH THE DAY
SO MOST OF THE MANUFACTURERS PLACED THEIR SONS IN SUCKING SITUATIONS AT FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE UNSPARINGLY CUTTING AWAY ALL OFF-SHOOTS IN THE DIRECTION OF LITERATURE OR HIGH MENTAL CULTIVATION IN HOPES OF THROWING THE WHOLE STRENGTH AND VIGOUR OF THE PLANT INTO COMMERCE
AND LOOK OUT FOR A SUBORDINATE SITUATION
AND WE ARE ASKED TO DINE THERE TO-DAY BUT EDITH EXPECTS ME BACK--I CANNOT GO SAID MARGARET THANKFUL TO HAVE SO GOOD AN EXCUSE
HAD ASKED EDITH FOR A LITTLE GREEK AIR ABOUT WHICH SHE HAD SPOKEN TO MISS THORNTON
THE DARK CIRCLES DEEPENED THE LIPS QUIVERED AND CONTRACTED AND SHE BECAME INSENSIBLE ONCE MORE
BUT IF I ONLY KNEW OF SOME GOOD DOCTOR I WOULD GO THIS AFTERNOON AND ASK HIM TO COME FOR I AM SURE MAMMA IS SERIOUSLY INDISPOSED SHE PUT THE TRUTH THUS PLAINLY AND STRONGLY BECAUSE HER FATHER HAD SO COMPLETELY SHUT HIS MIND AGAINST THE IDEA WHEN SHE HAD LAST NAMED HER FEARS
THERE WAS NO COMPULSION ONLY DEEP INTEREST IN THEM
I KNOW I DO NOT CARE ENOUGH ABOUT SCHOOLS
WE CAN'T CLAP FOLK INTO PRISON
YO NEED NA BE FEARED OF MY TELLING
I WILL COME AGAIN AS SOON AS I CAN
TAK THIS TAK AUGHT TO PLAY WI BUT DUNNOT CRY WHILE MY HEART'S BREAKING
AND WHETHER I WAS WRONG OR RIGHT I'M VERY SLEEPY
AND DR DONALDSON GAVE HIS CONSENT TO HER RETURNING INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM
I BITTERLY REPENT IT THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE OF SILENCE
NOW HAMPER FIRST GI'ES ME A BOX ON MY EAR AND THEN HE THROWS HIS BIG BOLUS AT ME AND SAYS HE RECKONS IT'LL DO ME NO GOOD I'M SUCH A FOOL BUT THERE IT IS I WISH SOME OF THE KINDEST AND WISEST OF THE MASTERS WOULD MEET SOME OF YOU MEN AND HAVE A GOOD TALK ON THESE THINGS
HOW EVIL HE WAS TO-NIGHT
WE DOCTORS DON'T LIKE IT I CAN TELL YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON DR DONALDSON
I TELL YOU YOU ARE TOO FANCIFUL
AND AT ANY RATE IF SHE TOOK UPON HERSELF TO MAKE INQUIRY FOR A SERVANT SHE COULD SPARE HER MOTHER THE RECITAL OF ALL HER DISAPPOINTMENTS AND FANCIED OR REAL INSULTS
SHE CAME BACK RATHER FLUSHED BUT LOOKING PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND UNCONSCIOUS
THE FOOLS WILL HAVE A STRIKE
I TRIED TO WEAR MY GREAT BEAUTY INDIAN SHAWL AT A PIC-NIC
HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH WITH THE SAME MEASURED COMPOSURE WITH WHICH HE DID EVERYTHING
HEMANS
HEMANS
HEMANS
AND HOW IMMEASURABLY DISTANT HE IS NOW
FREDERICK'S LIPS CLOSED WITH A LONG WHEW OF DISMAY
SHE WAS NOT SORRY WHEN AT TEN O'CLOCK THE SERVANTS FILED IN TO PRAYERS
BY DINT OF QUESTIONING MARGARET EXTRACTED FROM HER THE HORRIBLE FACT THAT BETTY BARNES HAVING BEEN INDUCED BY A GYPSY FORTUNE-TELLER TO LEND THE LATTER HER HUSBAND'S SUNDAY CLOTHES ON PROMISE OF HAVING THEM FAITHFULLY RETURNED ON THE SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE GOODMAN BARNES SHOULD HAVE MISSED THEM BECAME ALARMED BY THEIR NON-APPEARANCE AND HER CONSEQUENT DREAD OF HER HUSBAND'S ANGER AND AS ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE SAVAGE COUNTRY SUPERSTITIONS THE CRIES OF A CAT IN THE AGONIES OF BEING BOILED OR ROASTED ALIVE COMPELLED AS IT WERE THE POWERS OF DARKNESS TO FULFIL THE WISHES OF THE EXECUTIONER RESORT HAD BEEN HAD TO THE CHARM
NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD HER FATHER'S STEP ON THE GRAVEL OUTSIDE SHE STARTED UP AND HASTILY SHAKING HER HEAVY BLACK HAIR BACK AND WIPING A FEW TEARS AWAY THAT HAD COME ON HER CHEEKS SHE KNEW NOT HOW SHE WENT OUT TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR HIM
ONLY IT REALLY SOUNDED LIKE A VILLAGE IN A TALE RATHER THAN IN REAL LIFE AND SO IT IS REPLIED MARGARET EAGERLY
I NEVER WAS IN THE ROOM WITH A DEAD PERSON BEFORE STAY MISS
HE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE KNEW OF THIS OCCUPATION OF THE HOURS HE SHOULD HAVE SPENT IN SLEEP
HOW YOUR FATHER AND I TURNED SICK OVER THAT LIST WHEN THERE WAS NO NAME OF FREDERICK HALE
AT LAST SOME SLIGHT NOISE IN THE ROOM ABOVE SUGGESTED THE DESIRABLENESS OF MOVING THERE
I'VE BEEN STAYING AT THEIR HOUSE TILL I WAS DRIVEN OUT OF IT BY THE PERPETUAL CLACK ABOUT THAT THORNTON GIRL'S MARRIAGE
PERHAPS IT OUGHT TO BE SO PERHAPS NOT
AT LAST SHE STUNG HERSELF INTO ITS PERFORMANCE BY A SUSPICION WHICH IN SPITE OF ALL PROBABILITY SHE ALLOWED TO CROSS HER MIND THAT ALL THIS SWEETNESS WAS PUT ON WITH A VIEW OF PROPITIATING MR THORNTON
AND THEN THEY FELL AND SHE BENT OVER HER WORK AND DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
MY YOUNG LADY THOUGHT MRS THORNTON TO HERSELF
MRS HALE CALLED HER UNFEELING FOR SAYING THIS
THEN IN HIS HABITUAL COLDNESS OF TONE HE ANSWERED
AND WITH A WARM AND KINDLY SHAKE OF THE HAND HE LEFT THEM
MARGARET SAW THAT IN A TWINKLING
BUT IN THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF THE RECOLLECTION OF THOSE TIMES SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE SMALL DETAILS WHICH WERE NOT SO PLEASANT
STRIKING IS LEAVING OFF WORK TILL YOU GET YOUR OWN RATE OF WAGES IS IT NOT
AND THEN AS IF BY WAY OF PENANCE SHE TOOK UP HENRY'S COMMENTARIES AND TRIED TO FIX HER ATTENTION ON IT INSTEAD OF PURSUING THE EMPLOYMENT SHE TOOK PRIDE AND PLEASURE IN AND CONTINUING HER INSPECTION OF THE TABLE-LINEN
THE ASPECT OF HOME WAS ALL RIGHT AND BRIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED IT
MRS THORNTON WAS FAIRLY DISCOMFITED
AND AS HE CANNOT DO YOU MUCH GOOD SPIRITUALLY HAVING A HIDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF YOUR SUPERIORITY IN SUCH THINGS HE WOULD FAIN DO YOU THE POOR GOOD OF ENDOWING YOU MATERIALLY
AND WHEN WITH HIM SHE THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD SPEAK MORE EASILY TO HER MOTHER
COSMO IS QUITE AS GREAT A DARLING AS BABY AND NOT A BIT STOUT AND AS UN-GRUMPY AS EVER HUSBAND WAS
AND CUTTING OFF A SMALL PIECE FOR HIMSELF HE SAID
BUT SHE CREDITED ENOUGH TO MAKE HER MANNER TO MARGARET APPEAR VERY MUCH CONSTRAINED AT WISHING HER GOOD-BYE
AND IT WAS WORSE THAN UNFAIR FOR THEM TO SET ON HIM AS THEY THREATENED
IF SHE WISHES IT I'M SURE WE'LL BOTH GO WILLINGLY
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK BUT HELD OUT HER ARMS TOWARDS THEM TILL SHE COULD RECOVER BREATH
HE STARTED WHEN HE HEARD FREDERICK'S CRIES AND SHOOK HIS HEAD:--'POOR BOY
ENDEAVOURING TO DO RIGHT AND MAKING GREAT BLUNDERS
AT LAST HE SAID MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE YES
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A MYSTERIOUS SUPPLY OF MONEY FROM THESE UNIONS
SHE STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRAWING-ROOM AS IF ARRESTED IN HER FIRST IMPULSE TO RUSH DOWNSTAIRS AND AS IF BY THE SAME RESTRAINING THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
AND HAD NEVER PERCEIVED HOW SELFISH AND MATERIAL WERE TOO MANY OF THE ENDS THEY PROPOSED TO THEMSELVES AS THE RESULT OF ALL THEIR MIGHTY UNTIRING ENDEAVOUR TILL MARGARET EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HER GRATIFICATION HAD THE CANDOUR TO POINT THIS OUT AS THE TAINTING SIN IN SO MUCH THAT WAS NOBLE AND TO BE ADMIRED
OR IT MIGHT BE MISS HALE FIRST AND THEN YOU SIR
AND THEN THERE WAS THE MOVING OF CHAIRS THE RAISED VOICES ALL THE LITTLE DISTURBANCES OF LEAVE-TAKING
AND YET OF COURSE WE MUST ASK HIM TO DINNER--EDITH'S BROTHER-IN-LAW AND ALL
I DON'T MIND IRONING OR ANY KIND OF WORK FOR YOU AND PAPA
NINETEEN COME JULY AND I TOO AM NINETEEN SHE THOUGHT MORE SORROWFULLY THAN BESSY DID OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM
AND WHAT IS YOUR CORRESPONDENT MR THORNTON LIKE ASK MARGARET SAID HER HUSBAND
HE TURNED AWAY SAYING DON'T YOU FIND SUCH CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO THE MILL RATHER UNPLEASANT AT TIMES SHE DREW HERSELF UP
THE LIFE IN MILTON WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MRS HALE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE IN HELSTONE IN AND OUT PERPETUALLY INTO THE FRESH AND OPEN AIR
WHAT SORT OF A PERSON IS HE MARGARET I LIKED HIM LONG AGO SAID MARGARET GLANCING DOWN FOR A MOMENT
HIS FACE WAS SET INTO RIGID LINES OF CONTEMPTUOUS DEFIANCE
IT MAY NOT BE VERY CIVIL EDITH BUT IF YOU MEDDLE IN IT YOU WILL MAR IT
BUT AT LAST THE FOUR PACKERS WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO THEIR TEA
SHE GAVE THE DUE EMPHASIS
I'M NOT WANTING BRASS
IF WE HAD A GOOD EFFICIENT HOUSE-SERVANT DIXON COULD BE CONSTANTLY WITH HER AND I'D ANSWER FOR IT WE'D SOON SET HER UP AMONGST US IF CARE WILL DO IT
MISS HALE MIGHT LOVE ANOTHER--WAS INDIFFERENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS TO HIM--BUT HE WOULD YET DO HER FAITHFUL ACTS OF SERVICE OF WHICH SHE SHOULD NEVER KNOW
YOU DO WELL THEY WERE SILENT WHILE HE SPOKE
I AM COME PARTLY TO BRING YOU A NOTE FROM MY MOTHER AND PARTLY TO APOLOGISE FOR NOT KEEPING TO MY TIME YESTERDAY
VERY PROBABLY THEY ARE QUITE AWARE OF WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY JOHN--OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGE IT WOULD BE TO THEM--TO MR HALE I MEAN TO BE INTRODUCED TO SUCH PEOPLE AS THE STEPHENSES AND THE COLLINGBROOKS I'M SURE THAT MOTIVE WOULD NOT INFLUENCE THEM
BUT IN A MOMENT HIS STRAIGHTFORWARD HONESTY MADE HIM FEEL THAT HIS WORDS WERE BUT A POOR AND QUIBBLING ANSWER TO WHAT SHE HAD SAID
YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING ABOUT FREDERICK SINCE
I'D TAKE ANY WAGE THEY THOUGHT I WAS WORTH FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE CHILDER DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU WOULD BE
TO-NIGHT SHE IS LOOKING RADIANT
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU OR ELSE MISS HALE
HE COMES AMONG US HE WORKS AMONG US BUT HE'S NONE O US
IT WILL SPOIL MY NUMBER QUITE I DON'T MIND DINNER
NEITHER TASTE NOR DRESS WERE IN HER LINE OF SUBJECTS AND SHE HEARTILY WISHED THAT FANNY HAD ACCEPTED HER BROTHER'S OFFER OF HAVING THE WEDDING CLOTHES PROVIDED BY SOME FIRST-RATE LONDON DRESSMAKER WITHOUT THE ENDLESS TROUBLESOME DISCUSSIONS AND UNSETTLED WAVERING THAT AROSE OUT OF FANNY'S DESIRE TO CHOOSE AND SUPERINTEND EVERYTHING HERSELF
BY TH TWENTY-FIRST I RECKON HE'LL BE POTTERED IN HIS BRAINS HOW TO GET EM DONE IN TIME
HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS HAD BECOME COMPLICATED DURING THE STRIKE AND REQUIRED CLOSER ATTENTION THAN HE HAD GIVEN TO THEM LAST WINTER
ANOTHER MOMENT AND MR THORNTON MIGHT BE SMITTEN DOWN,--HE WHOM SHE HAD URGED AND GOADED TO COME TO THIS PERILOUS PLACE
BUT WHEN HE WERE IN LIFE AND WITH US HE DID LOVE US HE DID
OH MASTER!--OH MISS MARGARET
FOR HE WROTE WORD THAT HE BELIEVED HE MUST BE OCCUPIED SOME GREAT PART OF HIS TIME WITH MR THORNTON AS A NEW LEASE WAS IN PREPARATION AND THE TERMS OF IT MUST BE AGREED UPON
THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT
HE COULD NOT--SAY RATHER HE WOULD NOT--DENY HIMSELF THE CHANCE OF THE PLEASURE OF SEEING MARGARET
THEY WERE SO MUCH MORE AMUSING THAN ALL THE JOG-TROT HARLEY STREET WAYS
IS IT ANYTHING I CAN DO ALL THE LADIES SAID POOR CHILD ON RECEIVING THIS DISTRESSING INTELLIGENCE ABOUT EDITH
BUT WHY DO WE TALK OF LOVE OR HATRED
THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE AT HOME ON MONDAY
SHUT THE WINDOW AND COME IN AND MAKE TEA MARGARET WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME
THE TRUTH WAS THAT THERE WERE POINTS IN THEIR CONVERSATION THE OTHER NIGHT ON WHICH THEY HAD NO TIME THEN TO ENLARGE
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD THINK OF MARGARET
SHE HURRIED FREDERICK INTO THE CAB IN ORDER TO SHORTEN A SCENE WHICH SHE SAW WAS SO BITTERLY PAINFUL TO HER FATHER WHO WOULD ACCOMPANY HIS SON AS HE TOOK HIS LAST LOOK AT HIS MOTHER
CHANGED HIS SEAT WITHOUT FINDING COMFORT OR REST WHILE MR THORNTON SAT IMMOVEABLY STILL HIS EYES FIXED ON ONE SPOT IN THE NEWSPAPER WHICH HE HAD TAKEN UP IN ORDER TO GIVE HIMSELF LEISURE TO THINK
I SHOULD BREAK DOWN UTTERLY DON'T ASK MR THORNTON PAPA
MRS HALE BECAME MORE DISPLEASED
TAKE CARE YOU DON'T BREATHE OF MY HAVING BEEN--NOT EVEN TO THE SHAWS MARGARET TURNED TO THE ENVELOPE
HE HAD NOT FIVE HOURS TO SPARE HIMSELF
THE NURSES SAUNTERING ON WITH THEIR CHARGES WOULD PASS AND REPASS HER AND WONDER IN WHISPERS WHAT SHE COULD FIND TO LOOK AT SO LONG DAY AFTER DAY
THEY NOBBUT MAKE LIARS AND HYPOCRITES
IF SHE HAD DECOYED HER BROTHER HOME TO BLOT OUT THE MEMORY OF HIS ERROR BY HIS BLOOD
DEAR OLD DIXON YOU SHALL HAVE A LONG HOLIDAY IF WE GO
IF MR THORNTON WAS A FOOL IN THE MORNING AS HE ASSURED HIMSELF AT LEAST TWENTY TIMES HE WAS HE DID NOT GROW MUCH WISER IN THE AFTERNOON
IF I COULD--IF I HAD TIME TO THINK OF WHAT I HAD BETTER SAY
HE WAS NO MOCKING-BIRD OF PRAISE TO TRY BECAUSE ANOTHER EXTOLLED WHAT HE REVERENCED AND PASSIONATELY LOVED TO OUTDO HIM IN LAUDATION
YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
I DO THINK SHE IS BETTER SINCE LAST NIGHT SAID SHE
THEY TWO ALONE
HOW THEM TWO CHAPS IS BOUND UP IN ONE BODY IS A CRADDY FOR ME TO FIND OUT
MARGARET FELL INTO A STATE OF PROSTRATION WHICH DID NOT SHOW ITSELF IN SOBS AND TEARS OR EVEN FIND THE RELIEF OF WORDS
EDITH IS SITTING DOWN TO PLAY AND I JUST KNOW ENOUGH OF MUSIC TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES FOR HER
I SEE FURNITURE HERE WHICH OUR LABOURERS WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF BUYING AND FOOD COMMONLY USED WHICH THEY WOULD CONSIDER LUXURIES
SO WHEN THE MEN CAME TO ASK FOR THE FIVE PER CENT
MRS HALE WENT ON
AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MRS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
IT'S THE STOUT FLORID FELLOWS LIKE ME THAT ALWAYS GO OFF FIRST IF MR BELL HAD HAD A PROPHETIC EYE HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE TORCH ALL BUT INVERTED AND THE ANGEL WITH THE GRAVE AND COMPOSED FACE STANDING VERY NIGH BECKONING TO HIS FRIEND
SHE CANNOT BREATHE POOR THING WITH THIS CROWD ABOUT HER MARGARET WAS KNEELING DOWN BY MRS BOUCHER AND BATHING HER FACE WITH VINEGAR
AND SO IT WAS THAT THE WEIGHT THIS SORROWFUL TIME WAS LIGHTENED TO MARGARET
AND IN THE INTEREST OF WHAT WAS SAID THE UNPRETENDING SIMPLICITY OF THE PARSONAGE-WAYS--ABOVE ALL IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MARGARET MR LENNOX FORGOT THE LITTLE FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST PERCEIVED THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH WHEN SHE HAD DESCRIBED HER FATHER'S LIVING AS VERY SMALL
SHE HAD NOT MOVED ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HAD BEEN SOME GREAT EGYPTIAN STATUE
NAY MARGARET
IT ALL CAME BACK UPON HER
HE MOCKED AT HIMSELF FOR HAVING VALUED THE MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD PROTECTED HIM FROM THE FURY OF THE MOB
I WANT TO SEE YO AND TOUCH YO AS IN VERY DEED YO WERE IN MY DREAM MY DEAR BESSY IT IS QUITE A FANCY OF YOURS FANCY OR NO FANCY,--YO'VE COME AS I KNEW YO WOULD WHEN I SAW YO'R MOVEMENT IN MY DREAM,--AND WHEN YO'RE HERE ABOUT ME I RECKON I FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND COMFORTED JUST AS A FIRE COMFORTS ONE ON A DREE DAY
WE RETAIN MORE OF THEIR SPIRIT
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD FORCED HERSELF TO ONE UNTRUTH AND HAD BEEN STUNNED OUT OF ALL POWER OF VARYING IT
HAVE I NOT CARE
IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN GETTING RESTLESS BY BEING TOO LONG IN BED
AND INDEED MARGARET THE LONGING TO SEE FREDERICK STANDS BETWEEN ME AND GOD
I AM TIRED I CANNOT GO SHE WAS VERY SILENT AND TREMBLING WHILE SHE MADE TEA
MARGARET FEARED THAT MRS HEPWORTH WOULD FIND OUT THAT MR BELL WAS PLAYING UPON HER IN THE ADMIRATION HE THOUGHT FIT TO EXPRESS FOR EVERYTHING THAT ESPECIALLY GRATED ON HIS TASTE
IT'S JUST AS MUCH IN THE CAUSE OF OTHERS AS YON SOLDIER--ONLY M'APPEN THE CAUSE HE DIES FOR IS JUST THAT OF SOMEBODY HE NEVER CLAPT EYES ON NOR HEERD ON ALL HIS BORN DAYS WHILE I TAKE UP JOHN BOUCHER'S CAUSE AS LIVES NEXT DOOR BUT ONE WI A SICKLY WIFE AND EIGHT CHILDER NONE ON EM FACTORY AGE
IT MIGHT BE A CHANGE OF EMPLOYMENT FROM HIS TWO DAYS WORK OF WATCHING MARGARET BUT IT WAS NO CHANGE OF THOUGHT
AND SUCH A HEAVY CORNICE ROUND THE ROOM BUT WHEN THEY REMOVED TO THEIR NEW HOUSE IN MILTON THE OBNOXIOUS PAPERS WERE GONE
BUT I CANNOT BEAR EVERYTHING
BUT I BELONG TO TEUTONIC BLOOD
WHAT HELP
AND SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS
MARGARET THOUGHT THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIS OPINION AND THAT SHE COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN GO AND SEE THE HIGGINSES IN THE MEANTIME
HE'LL NEED ALL HIS BOASTED INFLUENCE TO KEEP HIS PLACE THIS TIME WHERE IS HE ASKED ANOTHER WHILE MARGARET HER BACK TOWARDS THEM WAS COUNTING HER CHANGE WITH TREMBLING FINGERS NOT DARING TO TURN ROUND UNTIL SHE HEARD THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
YO'VE NOT RED AND WHITE ENOUGH FOR THAT
BUT EVERY PULSE BEAT IN HIM AS HE REMEMBERED HOW SHE HAD COME DOWN AND PLACED HERSELF IN FOREMOST DANGER,--COULD IT BE TO SAVE HIM
AND SHE HAD CAUGHT THE IDEA OF THE VIVID BEAUTY OF THE FEATHERY LEAVES OF THE CARROTS IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF HIS LAST SENTENCE
FROM THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND--HAMPSHIRE I BELIEVE WAS THE COLD INDIFFERENT ANSWER
NO ONE WAS THERE AT FIRST
AND MOREOVER HE INTENDED TO TREAT HIMSELF TO A LITTLE DOCTORING AS HE HAD BEGUN TO COME ROUND TO HER OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE PLEASANTER TO THINK THAT HIS HEALTH WAS MORE IN FAULT THAN HE WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IRRITABLE AND CROSS
THE WHEELS OF THE MACHINERY OF DAILY LIFE WERE WELL OILED AND WENT ALONG WITH DELICIOUS SMOOTHNESS
ON ONE SIDE OF IT WERE GREAT CLOSED GATES FOR THE INGRESS AND EGRESS OF LURRIES AND WAGONS
AT LAST--IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN HOUR--HE LIFTED HIMSELF UP
YOU NEVER CAN TELL ME TOO MUCH
SHE STOOD BY THE TEA-TABLE IN A LIGHT-COLOURED MUSLIN GOWN WHICH HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PINK ABOUT IT
YOU WILL GO TO BED SOON PAPA WON'T YOU
GOOD-NIGHT MARGARET
BUT THOSE WHO IN YOUTH HAD CARED TO PENETRATE TO THE DELICACY OF THOUGHT AND FEELING THAT LAY BELOW HIS SILENCE AND INDECISION TOOK HIM TO THEIR HEARTS WITH SOMETHING OF THE PROTECTING KINDNESS WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN TO A WOMAN
WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING
AND YOU TALK OF THE TYRANNY OF THE MASTERS NAY SAID HIGGINS YO MAY SAY WHAT YO LIKE
NEVERTHELESS HIS MOUSTACHIOS ARE SPLENDID
MUCH OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF DEMEANOUR WITH WHICH MOTHERS ARE WONT TO TREAT THEIR WEAK AND SICKLY CHILDREN
AND THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND ALL I THINK I COULD SUPPORT THE HONOUR OF MEETING THE MAYOR OF MILTON
YET FOR THESE VERY FAMILIES THERE SEEMS NO OTHER RESOURCE NOW THAT THEIR WEEKLY WAGES ARE STOPPED BUT THE PAWN-SHOP
YOU ARE THE PERSON NOT WELL I THINK
PRIDE MUST ABIDE,"--AND SUCH WHOLESOME PIECES OF PITH
SHE DID NOT CARE ENOUGH FOR HER FOR THAT
THE TRAVELLER COULD BE REFRESHED AND BRIGHT AND THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE MEETING WITH HIS FATHER ALL BE OVER BEFORE HER MOTHER BECAME AWARE OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL
HE STARTED AT EVERY UNUSUAL SOUND
MARGARET I GO SO FAR IN MY IDEA OF YOUR TRUTHFULNESS THAT IT SHALL COVER YOUR COUSIN'S CHARACTER
ONE THAT I WAS RESOLVED EDITH SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ENCOUNTER
HE BUOYED HIMSELF UP IN EVERY RESPITE FROM HER PAIN AND BELIEVED THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY
YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND SHE SWEPT OUT OF IT WITH THE NOISELESS GRACE OF AN OFFENDED PRINCESS
AND APOLOGIES FOR FAILURE IN GOOD MANNERS
WHICH HE ALWAYS DID ON SOUND ECONOMICAL PRINCIPLES
FOR SOMEHOW THEY SAW MR THORNTON BUT VERY SELDOM NOW
THERE THAT'S CAPITAL DIXON
YOU'LL HAVE EM ALL THERE
IT WAS A TRIAL TO COME DOWN FROM SUCH MOTION OR SUCH STILLNESS ONLY GUIDED BY HER OWN SWEET WILL TO THE EVEN AND DECOROUS PACE NECESSARY IN STREETS
BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS AND HE MAY BE CHANGED
MR THORNTON MOVED SLIGHTLY AWAY LIFTED HIS EYEBROWS A VERY LITTLE AND THEN REPLIED
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE NOT MUSICAL SAID FANNY AS I SEE NO PIANO I AM FOND OF HEARING GOOD MUSIC
I MAY NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
THE DREARY PEACEFULNESS OF THE PRESENT TIME HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY SO LONG A PERIOD OF ANXIETY AND CARE--EVEN INTERMIXED WITH STORMS--THAT HER MIND HAD LOST ITS ELASTICITY
MARGARET THOUGHT SHE HAD SEEN THE FACE OF ONE OF THEM BEFORE AND RETURNED HIM A PROUD LOOK OF OFFENDED DIGNITY FOR HIS SOMEWHAT IMPERTINENT STARE OF UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION
SOMETIMES I'M SO TIRED OUT I THINK I CANNOT ENJOY HEAVEN WITHOUT A PIECE OF REST FIRST
AS A PROOF OF IT I BELIEVE I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER--IF I DO NOT HATE YOU--FOR THE DISDAIN WITH WHICH YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME DURING THIS LAST HALF-HOUR
HOW WILL IT AFFECT ME AND IF TWO OR THREE SPOKE TOGETHER THEY DWELT RATHER ON THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO WERE SAFE THAN DARED TO HINT AT THOSE LIKELY IN THEIR OPINION TO GO
I CANNOT PLAY WELL MYSELF
ALL THESE DIFFERENCES STRUCK UPON HER MIND AS SHE AND HER MOTHER WENT OUT NEXT MORNING TO LOOK FOR LODGINGS
IT WAS RATHER DULL FOR MARGARET AFTER DINNER
HE REVIEWED HIS POSITION AS A MILTON MANUFACTURER
THERE HAD BEEN NO PAIN--NO STRUGGLE
THEN I SHALL HAVE FULFILLED MY PROMISE AND DONE MY DUTY SHE WILL NEVER BEAR IT SAID HE PASSIONATELY
WHEN HE WAS GONE SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD SEEN THE GLEAM OF UNSHED TEARS IN HIS EYES
I ONLY WANT YOU TO DO JUSTICE TO MR THORNTON WHO IS I SUSPECT OF AN EXACTLY OPPOSITE NATURE,--A MAN WHO IS FAR TOO PROUD TO SHOW HIS FEELINGS
TO MARGARET HERSELF HE HARDLY SPOKE AT ALL
I'VE SEEN AND HEERD TOO MUCH ON HIM HE REFUSED YOU THEN SAID MARGARET SORROWFULLY
FANNY HAD RETURNED SCREAMING UP-STAIRS AS IF PURSUED AT EVERY STEP AND HAD THROWN HERSELF IN HYSTERICAL SOBBING ON THE SOFA
I AM GOING TO TELL HER
BUT I WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY WELL THOUGHT WATSON IT RELIEVES ME FROM AN AWKWARD JOB
AND NOW THEY'VE FRIGHTENED THESE POOR IRISH STARVELINGS SO WITH THEIR THREATS THAT WE DAREN'T LET THEM OUT
MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW BESSY GAVE A QUICK GLANCE AT MARGARET'S FACE TO SEE IF THE WISH EXPRESSED WAS REALLY FELT
I'LL STAND GUARD AT THE LODGE DOOR
THIS WAS A NEW IDEA--THIS WAS TOO INSULTING
SHE WAS INDEED INCLINED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA THAT THE INSPECTOR WOULD CALL AGAIN THAT NIGHT AS IT WAS ALREADY PAST NINE O'CLOCK
HOW MRS THORNTON HAD COME ONE DAY AND GOT TWO OR THREE GOOD BARGAINS AND MR THORNTON HAD COME THE NEXT AND IN HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN ONE OR TWO THINGS HAD BID AGAINST HIMSELF MUCH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE BYSTANDERS SO AS DIXON OBSERVED THAT MADE THINGS EVEN
HE HAD NA SPUNK ENOUGH
I AM GLAD OF IT SAID MARGARET LOOKING UP STRAIGHT INTO HIS FACE WITH HER SPEAKING EYES AND THEN DROPPING THEM UNDER HIS ELOQUENT GLANCE
MOTHER SAID HE HOLDING HER GENTLY IN HIS ARMS WHO HAS SENT ME MY LOT IN LIFE BOTH OF GOOD AND OF EVIL SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
MAPPEN AS TENDER AS A MOTHER
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EDITH CAME IN FROM THE BACK DRAWING-ROOM WINKING AND BLINKING HER EYES AT THE STRONGER LIGHT SHAKING BACK HER SLIGHTLY-RUFFLED CURLS AND ALTOGETHER LOOKING LIKE THE SLEEPING BEAUTY JUST STARTLED FROM HER DREAMS
HIS FACE WAS GRAY AND PALE
A SENSE OF INDESCRIBABLE WEARINESS OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A PRETTY EFFECT IN WHICH EDITH HAD BEEN BUSIED AS SUPREME AUTHORITY FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS OPPRESSED HER JUST NOW
IT WAS BUT A NATURAL IMPRESSION THAT WAS MADE UPON HIM AND YET SHE WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED BY IT
NOT THOSE HORRID BLUE FLOWERS TO THAT DEAD GOLD-COLOURED GOWN
LET ME CLOSE MY EYES AND DREAM W
THE HANDS HAD MISTAKEN THEIR MAN IN TRYING THAT DODGE ON HIM
IT MAKES ME FEEL YOUNG AGAIN TO SEE HIS ENJOYMENT AND APPRECIATION OF ALL THAT IS FINE IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE I HAVE NO DOUBT THE CLASSICS ARE VERY DESIRABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEISURE
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD MEAN BY IT THEN
BUT THERE I AM PERHAPS SOMEWHAT OF A PEDANT
ALL SHE COULD SEE WAS THAT HER BROTHER'S FACE WAS UNUSUALLY DARK IN COMPLEXION AND SHE CAUGHT THE STEALTHY LOOK OF A PAIR OF REMARKABLY LONG-CUT BLUE EYES THAT SUDDENLY TWINKLED UP WITH A DROLL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR MUTUAL PURPOSE OF INSPECTING EACH OTHER
OR THAT IF IT WAS TOO SEVERE TO ALLOW HER TO COME OUT THAT DAY THE CALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED
BUT WHO NOW GAVE AN OPINION THE GROUNDS OF WHICH WERE SO CLEARLY STATED THAT EVEN THE OPPONENTS YIELDED
IT SENT A GLOW TO HER HEART TO KNOW HOW SHE COULD FEEL TOWARDS ONE WHO HAD REASON TO DESPISE HER
AND ALL SORTS OF WILD FANCIES CHASED EACH OTHER LIKE DREAMS THROUGH HIS MIND
WELL I SEES THESE PEOPLE
I AM PUNISHED
MARGARET SMILED INTO HER EYES TO RE-ASSURE HER
I COULD HAVE WISHED TO HAVE HAD OTHER TALK ABOUT ME IN MY LATTER DAYS THAN JUST THE CLASHING AND CLANGING AND CLATTERING THAT HAS WEARIED A MY LIFE LONG ABOUT WORK AND WAGES AND MASTERS AND HANDS AND KNOBSTICKS POOR WENCH
ONLY I WON'T BAIT YOU WITH IT ANY MORE JUST NOW
IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR-LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR BY WHICH MRS HALE'S EFFORTS AT CONVERSATION WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE BOUNDED
AS HE TOUCHED HER SHE SPRANG UP AND SMILING WITH FORCED BRIGHTNESS BEGAN TO TALK OF THE LENNOXES WITH SUCH A VEHEMENT DESIRE TO TURN THE CONVERSATION THAT MR HALE WAS TOO TENDER-HEARTED TO TRY TO FORCE IT BACK INTO THE OLD CHANNEL
THE DULL GRAY DAYS OF THE PRECEDING WINTER AND SPRING SO UNEVENTLESS AND MONOTONOUS SEEMED MORE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT SHE CARED FOR NOW ABOVE ALL PRICE
BUT IN HER SOFT TONES AND WITH HER RELUCTANT MANNER SHOWING THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO SAY ANYTHING UNPLEASANT IT DID NOT SEEM TO ANNOY HIGGINS ONLY TO PERPLEX HIM
REMEMBER THAT AND GOD BLESS YOU SO THEY FELL BACK INTO THE MONOTONY OF THE QUIET LIFE THEY WOULD HENCEFORTH LEAD
MARGARET STOPPED HER MERRIMENT AS SOON AS SHE SAW MRS THORNTON'S ANNOYED LOOK
THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE GATHERING WOE OF WHICH SHE HEARD FROM BESSY
SO TAKING THE CAP IN HER HAND SHE WENT TO THE KITCHEN
NOT THAT I WAS NOT EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE POOR DEAR GENERAL BUT STILL DISPARITY OF AGE IS A DRAWBACK
WHAT TIME ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THURSDAY THE TWENTY-SIXTH THEY WALKED ON SIDE BY SIDE IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
SMOTHERED HIDDEN KILLED WITH MY FINERY
SHE WAS SLEEPING BUT DEATH HAD SIGNED HER FOR HIS OWN AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT ERE LONG HE WOULD RETURN TO TAKE POSSESSION
EVERY PLACE SEEMED PLEASANTER
AND CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE SUPPRESSED SIGH WHICH HE HEAVED IN GOING PAST THE ROOM WHERE SOME OF THE MEN WERE WORKING
BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST,--AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT BESSY HAD BEEN WATCHING MARGARET'S FACE
I'D SOONER KNOCK HIM DOWN THAN ASK A FAVOUR FROM HIM
BY THE TIME THE FROST HAD SET IN THEY SHOULD BE FAR AWAY FROM HELSTONE
AND IT WAS ALSO AGREED THAT SHE NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE MUCH PLEASURE IN THE SOCIETY OF ANY ONE BUT HENRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FAMILY
IF I THINK OF IT AT ALL I CONNECT IT WITH MY SON AND FEEL HOW ALL BELONGS TO HIM AND THAT HIS IS THE HEAD THAT DIRECTS IT
SHE CLEARED HER THROAT AND BEGAN
AND NOW AND THEN MARGARET WONDERED WHAT IT WAS THAT HE COULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHILE HE KEPT SILENCE BUT WAS EVIDENTLY OBSERVING WITH AN INTEREST THAT WAS SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC ALL THAT EDITH AND SHE WERE DOING
OH IF I WERE NOT MARRIED--IF I WERE BUT MYSELF IN THE WORLD HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
WHEN MR HALE CAME IN MARGARET WENT OUT OPPRESSED WITH GLOOM AND SEEING NO PROMISE OF BRIGHTNESS ON ANY SIDE OF THE HORIZON
MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY
IF I GET WRONG IN MY REASONING RECOLLECT IT IS YOU WHO ADOPTED THE ANALOGY VERY LATELY SAID MARGARET I HEARD A STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IN NUREMBERG ONLY THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO
BUT THE PRETTY TIMID GIRLISH LETTERS OF DOLORES WERE BEGINNING TO HAVE A CHARM FOR BOTH MARGARET AND HER FATHER
AND I SHOULD ESPECIALLY DISLIKE THE IDEA OF OUR ASKING HIM
HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF-REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MR HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING
SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF HE OUGHT TO BE ROUSED
MR THORNTON SIGHED AS HE TOOK IN ALL THIS WITH ONE OF HIS SUDDEN COMPREHENSIVE GLANCES
I CANNOT ANSWER YOU AS YOU WANT ME TO DO AND YET I SHOULD FEEL SO SORRY IF I VEXED YOU MARGARET SAID HE LOOKING INTO HER EYES WHICH MET HIS WITH THEIR OPEN STRAIGHT LOOK EXPRESSIVE OF THE UTMOST GOOD FAITH AND RELUCTANCE TO GIVE PAIN
SHE THREW HERSELF DRESSED AS SHE WAS UPON HER BED
NOT THAT I MEAN TO DIE YET
AND I RECKON HE'S TAKEN ABACK BY ME PRETTY MUCH AS I AM BY HIM
HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED A COMMITTEE-MAN AND SAID THAT HE KNEW SECRETS OF WHICH THE EXOTERIC KNEW NOTHING
IF IT'S ONLY FOR THE RECOLLECTION OF THE WAY IN WHICH YOU'VE USED THE POOR KNOBSTICKS BEFORE NOW I SAY NO
YOU WILL BRING ME WORD THAT HE IS CLEAR OF MILTON AT ANY RATE CERTAINLY SAID MARGARET
HE IS NOT SAUCY
BUT GO ON THEN HERE AND THERE THERE ARE WIDE COMMONS HIGH UP AS IF ABOVE THE VERY TOPS OF THE TREES I'M GLAD OF THAT
THEN HESITATED A LITTLE BEFORE SHE SAID
BUT OF COURSE WHEN THIS GREAT OLD CHILD WAS TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD EVERY BAD COUNSELLOR HAD POWER OVER HIM
SUCH A THING HAS NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD ENTERING HER HEART WOULD DO
NO ONE WOULD READ A PAMPHLET OF SELF-JUSTIFICATION SO LONG AFTER THE DEED EVEN IF I PUT ONE OUT WILL YOU CONSULT A LAWYER AS TO YOUR CHANCES OF EXCULPATION ASKED MARGARET LOOKING UP AND TURNING VERY RED
IF MR BELL CANNOT COME I SHALL GO
IT'S NOT THAT WE WANT THEIR BRASS SO MUCH THIS TIME AS WE'VE DONE MANY A TIME AFORE
PLAYED WITH HIS LITTLE BOY FOR ANOTHER HOUR AND LOUNGED AWAY THE REST OF HIS TIME AT HIS CLUB WHEN HE WAS NOT ENGAGED OUT TO DINNER
THEY SAID YO WERE ILL,--AND BUTTER ME BUT YO DUNNOT LOOK LIKE TH SAME WENCH
AND SHE TRIED TO SETTLE THAT MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEM FOR WOMEN HOW MUCH WAS TO BE UTTERLY MERGED IN OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY AND HOW MUCH MIGHT BE SET APART FOR FREEDOM IN WORKING
YET EVEN WITH ALL THESE DRAWBACKS I FELT THAT I WAS ON THE RIGHT PATH AND THAT STARTING FROM A KIND OF FRIENDSHIP WITH ONE I WAS BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH MANY
MARGARET CAUGHT ONE GLANCE AT HIS FACE BEFORE HE WENT
HE NAMED NOTHING
BUT IF IT AMUSES HER I LET IT A BE BUT I'M NONE GOING TO HAVE MORE STUFF POURED INTO HER BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY DAYS DID MARGARET FEEL AT REST
HE WISHED HE COULD UNNATIVE HIMSELF AND DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS PARDON IF IT WERE OFFERED HIM NOR LIVE IN THE COUNTRY IF HE HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO
HE DOES NOT THINK HER SERIOUSLY ILL NOT AT PRESENT
I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE
AFTER MARGARET LEFT THE ROOM HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND ASSURED HIMSELF THAT IT WAS SHUT
MY ONLY WISH IS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF CULTIVATING SOME INTERCOURSE WITH THE HANDS BEYOND THE MERE CASH NEXUS BUT IT MIGHT BE THE POINT ARCHIMEDES SOUGHT FROM WHICH TO MOVE THE EARTH TO JUDGE FROM THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO IT BY SOME OF OUR MANUFACTURERS WHO SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND LOOK GRAVE AS SOON AS I NAME THE ONE OR TWO EXPERIMENTS THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY YOU CALL THEM EXPERIMENTS I NOTICE SAID MR COLTHURST WITH A DELICATE INCREASE OF RESPECT IN HIS MANNER
SHE WAS RESTLESS AND UNCOMFORTABLE IN EVERY POSITION AND BEFORE NIGHT SHE BECAME VERY FEVERISH
YOU MIGHT GO ON AND SEE EDITH AT CORFU IF YOU LIKED MARGARET DID NOT SPEAK ALL AT ONCE
ILL PREPARATION FOR THE COMING DAY
OF ALL FAULTS THE ONE SHE MOST DESPISED IN OTHERS WAS THE WANT OF BRAVERY
THERE ARE DAYS WI YOU AS WI OTHER FOLK I SUPPOSE WHEN YO GET UP AND GO THROUGH TH HOURS JUST LONGING FOR A BIT OF A CHANGE--A BIT OF A FILLIP AS IT WERE
SHE YEARNED FOR THE STRENGTH WHICH SUCH A CHANGE WOULD GIVE,--EVEN FOR A FEW HOURS TO BE IN THE MIDST OF THAT BRIGHT LIFE AND TO FEEL YOUNG AGAIN
I CAN TAKE A CAB HERE IF I LIKE
I LAY YO MY HEART AND SOUL WE'LL WIN FOR A THIS
AY AN CHASE YO THROUGH HEAVEN WI MY HATRED,--I WILL LAD
BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN ILL MYSELF SO I AM NOT MUCH UP TO INVALIDS FANCIES WELL
IT WAS AS FOLLOWS OH MARGARET IT IS WORTH A JOURNEY FROM ENGLAND TO SEE MY BOY
SHE HEARD A STEP ON THE STAIRS BUT IT WAS ONLY ONE AND SHE KNEW IT WAS DIXON'S
FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER
HAVING MADE ALL THE MOTHERS HERE ENVIOUS I WANT TO SHOW HIM TO SOMEBODY NEW AND HEAR A FRESH SET OF ADMIRING EXPRESSIONS
IT IS A PAINFUL THING BUT IT MUST BE DONE AND I WILL DO IT AS WELL AS EVER I CAN
WAS IT A DOUBT--A FEAR--A WANDERING UNCERTAINTY SEEKING REST BUT FINDING NONE--SO TEAR-BLINDED WERE ITS EYES--MR THORNTON INSTEAD OF BEING SHOCKED SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH THAT VERY STAGE OF THOUGHT HIMSELF AND COULD SUGGEST WHERE THE EXACT RAY OF LIGHT WAS TO BE FOUND WHICH SHOULD MAKE THE DARK PLACES PLAIN
INTO THE VERY MIDST OF THESE WONDERS MR THORNTON CAME BRINGING ANOTHER OFFERING OF FRUIT FOR MRS HALE
IT WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT TO HER TO THINK THAT SHE HAD GONE THOUGH IT WAS ONLY TO HEAR THAT HE HAD DIED IN THE NIGHT
STUDYING THE REALITY OF HER DEATH
THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A NEW TRADE GAVE THOSE EARLY MASTERS ENORMOUS POWER OF WEALTH AND COMMAND
I DON'T WONDER AT IT SAID SHE
DOES HE REALLY FIND TIME TO READ WITH A TUTOR IN THE MIDST OF ALL HIS BUSINESS,--AND THIS ABOMINABLE STRIKE IN HAND AS WELL FANNY WAS NOT SURE FROM MRS SLICKSON'S MANNER WHETHER SHE OUGHT TO BE PROUD OR ASHAMED OF HER BROTHER'S CONDUCT
SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE PATIENT
SHUT DOWN THE WINDOWS INSTANTLY MOTHER EXCLAIMED HE
I'M GOING TO MILTON BOUND ON A MELANCHOLY ERRAND
I SHOULD BE LOTH TO HAVE YO LOOKED DOWN UPON
NOW SHE WAS ALONE AN ORPHAN AND THEY STRANGELY HAD GONE AWAY FROM HER AND VANISHED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH
WE HATE TO HAVE LAWS MADE FOR US AT A DISTANCE
OF COURSE SHE WAS PAID FOR HER TROUBLE
I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA
I AM NOT SO INDIFFERENT TO HER AS SHE BELIEVES THOUGHT HE TO HIMSELF
AND SO THE STRIKE IS AT AN END SAID MARGARET
SHE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND PRAYED LONG AND EARNESTLY
NO CORDS OR CHAINS CAN KEEP HIM
SHE SAT QUITE STILL AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTARY GLANCE OF GRIEVED SURPRISE THAT MADE HER EYES LOOK LIKE SOME CHILD'S WHO HAS MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED REBUFF
AND NOW WHEN TH UNION WOULD HA THANKED HIM FOR FOLLOWING UP TH CHASE AFTER BOUCHER AND THEM CHAPS AS WENT RIGHT AGAIN OUR COMMANDS IT'S THORNTON WHO STEPS FORRARD AND COOLLY SAYS THAT AS TH STRIKE'S AT AN END HE AS PARTY INJURED DOESN'T WANT TO PRESS THE CHARGE AGAIN THE RIOTERS
THINK OF IT FATHER
NOW I'LL GIVE YO A CHANCE AND TRY IF YO'VE ANY SENSE IN YO HERE'S A BOOK WRITTEN BY A FRIEND O MINE AND IF YO'LL READ IT YO'LL SEE HOW WAGES FIND THEIR OWN LEVEL WITHOUT EITHER MASTERS OR MEN HAVING AUGHT TO DO WITH THEM
AND WHEN I GOT TO HIM HE DID NOT SPEAK OR SEEM SURPRISED TO SEE ME THERE MORE THAN THREE MILES FROM HOME BESIDE THE OLDHAM BEECH-TREE
SHE HEARD A STEP FOLLOWING THEM ALONG THE FLAGS
HER FATHER WAS EXAMINING PAPERS BOOKS REGISTERS WHAT NOT IN THE VESTRY WITH THE CLERK
NOW TO MRS THORNTON'S THOUGHT SHE TO HERSELF
BUT WHY DIDST THOU NOT TELL ME AFORE THOU FOOLISH WENCH SHE DID NOT SPEAK FOR A WHILE AND THEN SO LOW THAT ONLY MARGARET HEARD HER
SHE DWELT UPON WHAT HE MUST HAVE BORNE IN SECRET FOR LONG
MIND YOU DON'T BE CAJOLED INTO PAYING ANY MORE FOR HER THEN YOU WON'T BE THROWN ADRIFT IF SOME DAY THE CAPTAIN WISHES TO HAVE HIS HOUSE TO HIMSELF BUT YOU CAN CARRY YOURSELF AND YOUR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OFF SOMEWHERE ELSE
HE'D HA GIVEN HIS RIGHT HAND IF IT HAD NEVER COME TO PASS
BUT IF HE DREADED EXPOSURE OF HIS TENDERNESS HE WAS EQUALLY DESIROUS THAT ALL MEN SHOULD RECOGNISE HIS JUSTICE
I AM TIRED SAID MR HALE
I MUST FIRST CATCH MY LAWYER AND HAVE A LOOK AT HIM AND SEE HOW I LIKE HIM BEFORE I MAKE HIM INTO MY CONFIDANT
CANNOT YOU COME HERE
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT HE COULD NOT LISTEN FOR LONG TOGETHER
SHE BROUGHT ENDLESS PIECES OF MILTON GOSSIP
BUT THEY VISIT WI A TH FIRST FOLK IN MILTON AND YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE QUITE THE FIRST FOLK IN MILTON EH BESSY BESSY'S CHEEKS FLUSHED A LITTLE AT HER THOUGHT BEING THUS EASILY READ
HE IS IN YOUR ROOM NOW MA'AM THANK YOU
OTHERWISE NOT A FEATURE MOVED
I DOUBT IF DIXON CAN MAKE HERSELF COMFORTABLE
BROODS OF PIGEONS HOVERED AROUND THESE PEAKED QUAINT GABLES SLOWLY SETTLING HERE AND THERE AND RUFFLING THEIR SOFT SHINY FEATHERS AS IF EXPOSING EVERY FIBRE TO THE DELICIOUS WARMTH
SPEAKING OF VULGARITY AND COMMONNESS YOU MUST PREPARE YOURSELF FOR OUR DRAWING-ROOM PAPER
YOU DON'T WANT IMPUDENCE THAT'S VERY CLEAR I'VE GETTEN ENEMIES AND BACKBITERS LIKE MY BETTERS
BUT SHE COULD NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING SAVE THE SAVAGE SATISFACTION OF THE ROLLING ANGRY MURMUR
I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME OF THEIR PROSPECTUSES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE MR THORNTON
I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN BED
AND SOMEHOW THESE CARELESS WORDS OF HER FATHER'S TOUCHING ON THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE SUNNY TIMES OF OLD MADE HER START UP AND DROPPING HER SEWING ON THE GROUND SHE WENT HASTILY OUT OF THE ROOM INTO HER OWN LITTLE CHAMBER
I CAN PAY A PRETTY LONG BILL IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF SUCCESS
ALL THE STREET TURNED OUT TO SEE AND SEEING TO ACCOMPANY THE PROCESSION EACH ONE QUESTIONING THE BEARERS WHO ANSWERED ALMOST RELUCTANTLY AT LAST SO OFTEN HAD THEY TOLD THE TALE
BUT SHE REALLY LOVES US ALL AND WOULD BE MISERABLE TO LEAVE US I AM SURE--ESPECIALLY IN THIS CHANGE
SHE WAS MORE ROUSED BY A LETTER FROM EDITH FULL OF SYMPATHY ABOUT HER AUNT'S DEATH
WHEREVER SHE LOOKED THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF CARE AND LABOUR BUT NOT CARE AND LABOUR TO PROCURE EASE TO HELP ON HABITS OF TRANQUIL HOME EMPLOYMENT
YOU CAN SAY NOTHING MORE MRS THORNTON
IF YOU HAVE ANY COURAGE OR NOBLE QUALITY IN YOU GO OUT AND SPEAK TO THEM MAN TO MAN HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER WHILE SHE SPOKE
AND BY WAY OF BEING EVEN I ASKED HIM AFTER HIS FATHER WHO I KNEW HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF DOORS AS IF THEY WAS THE BEST FRIENDS AS EVER WAS
DO WHAT YOU THINK BEST
WHAT WOULD BE PEACE TO THEM WOULD BE ETERNAL FRETTING TO YOU
AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY
HER FEVERISH THOUGHTS PASSED AND REPASSED THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING AND KEPT THEIR OWN MISERABLE IDENTITY
SHE WRENCHED HERSELF AWAY FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF ALL THE DREARY CHANGES THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT ABOUT TO HERSELF BY HER SON'S MARRIAGE
SOME'S PRE-ELECTED TO SUMPTUOUS FEASTS AND PURPLE AND FINE LINEN,--MAY BE YO'RE ONE ON EM
I CAN MAKE NOUGHT ON'T
HE LOOKED A COMPLETE GENTLEMAN IN HIS RATHER THREADBARE COAT AND WELL-WORN HAT
THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR SOME TIME BEFORE MRS THORNTON ENTERED
I TOLD HIM TO GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
BUT WHAT WAS REALLY FALSE AND WRONG WAS KNOWN TO HIM AND HE HAD A RIGHT TO JUDGE HER
BUT WHATEVER CAME THE COMMITTEE CHARGED ALL MEMBERS O TH UNION TO LIE DOWN AND DIE IF NEED WERE WITHOUT STRIKING A BLOW
WE SEE THE STORM ON THE HORIZON AND DRAW IN OUR SAILS
HOW LONG HAS THAT MAN HIGGINS BEEN WAITING TO SPEAK TO ME HE WAS OUTSIDE THE GATE BEFORE EIGHT O'CLOCK SIR
THEN SHE STARTED UP AND FOLLOWED HER UPSTAIRS INTO HER ROOM
IT WERE ALL O'ER WI THE STRIKE THEN THEN WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER TO HAVE LEFT HIM ALONE AND NOT FORCED HIM TO JOIN THE UNION
HE WOULD SUCCUMB TO ALL THESE CAUSES FOR MORBID REGRET OVER WHAT COULD NOT BE RECALLED
THEY DID NOT MAKE MUCH PROGRESS WITH THEIR WORK
IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE OUTLAY BUT IT REPAYS ME IN THE SAVING OF COAL
JANE PAUSED IN HER BATHING TO REPLY TO MISS THORNTON'S QUESTION
AND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER PERHAPS TO SET AN EXAMPLE OF CLEARING THE HOUSE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH IDLE IF SYMPATHISING GAZERS
OH MR THORNTON I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOT GOOD ENOUGH
STILL WHEN OTHER SUBJECTS PALLED UPON HER AND SHE GAVE BUT SHORT ANSWERS TO MANY QUESTIONS HENRY LENNOX FOUND OUT THAT AN ENQUIRY AS TO SOME DARKSHIRE PECULIARITY OF CHARACTER CALLED BACK THE LIGHT INTO HER EYE THE GLOW INTO HER CHEEK
SHE SAW THE IDEA OF THE TRUTH GLIMMER INTO THEIR FILMY SADNESS AND BE DISMISSED THENCE AS A WILD IMAGINATION
THERE IS ALSO SOME REASON TO IDENTIFY THE LADY WITH YOURSELF
HOW CAME HE TO LET YOU AND YOUR WISDOM GO WELL WE PARTED WI MUTUAL DISSATISFACTION
I TOLD HER I SHOULD CALL AGAIN BUT SEEING YOU JUST AS I WAS ON MY WAY BACK FROM QUESTIONING THE YOUNG MAN WHO SAID IT WAS HER I THOUGHT I WOULD ASK YOUR ADVICE BOTH AS THE MAGISTRATE WHO SAW LEONARDS ON HIS DEATH-BED AND AS THE GENTLEMAN WHO GOT ME MY BERTH IN THE FORCE YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT SAID MR THORNTON
BUT HE--THAT IS MY INFORMANT--SPOKE AS IF THE MASTERS WOULD LIKE THEIR HANDS TO BE MERELY TALL LARGE CHILDREN--LIVING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT--WITH A BLIND UNREASONING KIND OF OBEDIENCE IN SHORT MISS HALE IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT YOUR INFORMANT FOUND A PRETTY READY LISTENER TO ALL THE SLANDER HE CHOSE TO UTTER AGAINST THE MASTERS SAID MR THORNTON IN AN OFFENDED TONE
SET A BULLDOG ON HIND LEGS AND DRESS HIM UP IN COAT AND BREECHES AND YO'N JUST GETTEN JOHN THORNTON NAY SAID MARGARET LAUGHING I DENY THAT
SHE WAS TRYING TO REALISE THAT IN ORDER THAT WHEN IT CAME SHE MIGHT BE READY TO COMFORT HER FATHER
BUT I WILL NEITHER BE FORCED TO GIVE MY REASONS NOR FLINCH FROM WHAT I HAVE ONCE DECLARED TO BE MY RESOLUTION
IT IS NOT PRETENCE OF DOING GOD THE GREATEST SERVICE OR PERFORMING THE WEIGHTIEST DUTY THAT WILL EXCUSE THE LEAST SIN THOUGH THAT SIN CAPACITATED OR GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DOING THAT DUTY
WHEN CHARLOTTE TOLD ME JUST NOW YOU WERE SOBBING MISS HALE I THOUGHT NO WONDER POOR THING
WHAT BUSINESS HAD HE TO BE THE ONLY PERSON EXCEPT DR DONALDSON AND DIXON ADMITTED TO THE AWFUL SECRET WHICH SHE HELD SHUT UP IN THE MOST DARK AND SACRED RECESS OF HER HEART--NOT DARING TO LOOK AT IT UNLESS SHE INVOKED HEAVENLY STRENGTH TO BEAR THE SIGHT--THAT SOME DAY SOON SHE SHOULD CRY ALOUD FOR HER MOTHER AND NO ANSWER WOULD COME OUT OF THE BLANK DUMB DARKNESS
YOU'RE A PRETTY CHAP TO COME ASKING ME FOR WORK
IT'S A DREE TASK
ONLY MAMMA TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
BUT THROUGH THAT FURNACE HE WOULD FIGHT HIS WAY OUT INTO THE SERENITY OF MIDDLE AGE,--ALL THE RICHER AND MORE HUMAN FOR HAVING KNOWN THIS GREAT PASSION
HE GAVE YOU STRENGTH TO DO WHAT YOUR CONSCIENCE TOLD YOU WAS RIGHT
WHICH IS A MOST UNSUITABLE PLACE FOR YOU THOUGH IT WAS MY RECOMMENDATION IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
YOU HAVE NO FRIEND NEAR
HE WOULD WEIGH EACH WORD
THEY SQUANDERED THEIR CAPABILITIES OF APPRECIATION INTO A MERE FLOW OF APPROPRIATE WORDS
EACH GLIMPSE INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE SATE BY HIS FATHER CONVERSING WITH HIM ABOUT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT NOR CARED TO KNOW,--WAS INCREASE OF STRENGTH TO HER
MY NAME IS WATSON--GEORGE WATSON SIR THAT YOU GOT AH YES
AND I SAW SUCH A MISERABLE BLACK FRIZZLE OF A DINNER--A GREASY CINDER OF MEAT AS FIRST SET ME A-THINKING
SHE'S A BIT OF A FINE LADY WITH HER INVALIDISM
OR A SQUATTER'S ROUGHLY-BUILT AND DECAYING COTTAGE HAD DISAPPEARED
AND AGAINST IT WAS THE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD ADD MATERIALLY TO HER FATHER'S NERVOUSNESS IF IT WERE INDEED NECESSARY FOR FREDERICK TO COME TO ENGLAND AGAIN
THE FARE IS FAR DIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO I'SE NOUGHT PARTICULAR ABOUT MY MEAT SAID HE AS IF OFFENDED
BUT NOW SHE TRIED TO STEAL PAST HIS ABSTRACTED GAZE AND TO LEAVE HIM IN THE SOLEMN CIRCLE OF HIS HOUSEHOLD MISERY
ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT
THE SAMENESS OF THEIR TOIL DEADENS THEIR IMAGINATION
THIS AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DRAWING-ROOM UNABLE TO BEAR THE SOLITUDE OF HIS STUDY OR TO EMPLOY HIMSELF IN ANY WAY
OUR MARY'S A GOOD WENCH
I AM NOT BECOME SO FINE AS TO DESIRE TO FORGET THE SOURCE OF MY SON'S WEALTH AND POWER
IF HER ACCOUNTS OF THE OLD HARLEY STREET SET WERE A LITTLE SARCASTIC HER FATHER COULD NOT BEAR TO CHECK HER AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE AT ANOTHER TIME--FOR HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER SHAKE OFF HER CARES
HE WOULD EXAMINE--HE WOULD TAKE EVERY PAINS
SO I MADE IT INTO A CAPITAL CARPET FOR US ALL TO SIT DOWN UPON
HE SANK AGAIN INTO LISTLESSNESS
MRS THORNTON LOOKED WITH WILD ANXIETY AT HER SON'S COUNTENANCE AS IF TO GAIN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SUDDEN STILLNESS FROM HIM
WHAT HAS BROUGHT YOU HOME SO EARLY
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD
AND THE POOR LABOURERS IN THE FIELDS OR LEISURELY TRAMPING HOME AT EVE OR TENDING THEIR CATTLE IN THE FOREST WERE ALWAYS AT LIBERTY TO SPEAK OR BE SPOKEN TO
DON'T MOCK MY OWN DEEP FEELING OF UNWORTHINESS AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO HE GENTLY DISENGAGED HER HANDS FROM HER FACE AND LAID HER ARMS AS THEY HAD ONCE BEFORE BEEN PLACED TO PROTECT HIM FROM THE RIOTERS
ALL THAT YESTERDAY HE MIGHT MISTAKE
ONLY WAIT TILL PAPA COMES IN
ALL HIS BUSINESS PLANS HAD RECEIVED A CHECK A SUDDEN PULL-UP FROM THIS APPROACHING TURN-OUT
I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH YOU ABOUT DINNER THE LITTLE CASEMENT WINDOW IN MARGARET'S BED-CHAMBER WAS ALMOST FILLED UP WITH ROSE AND VINE BRANCHES
SHE ALMOST BLAMED HERSELF FOR HAVING FELT HER SOLITUDE AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS ABSENCE AS A RELIEF
SHE HAD HASTILY GONE DOWN STAIRS TO TELL MARY OF THE ARRANGEMENT
OUT SPRINGS A SPARK OF TRUTH FROM THE COLLISION OF THE SWORD AND SHIELD W
THEN ALL WAS STILL FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE
AS I WAS A-SAYIN SIR I RECKON YO'D NOT HA MUCH BELIEF IN YO IF YO LIVED HERE,--IF YO'D BEEN BRED HERE
HE WAS AS DIZZY AS IF MARGARET INSTEAD OF LOOKING AND SPEAKING AND MOVING LIKE A TENDER GRACEFUL WOMAN HAD BEEN A STURDY FISH-WIFE AND GIVEN HIM A SOUND BLOW WITH HER FISTS
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT HERE WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO SKETCH I SHOULD SAY THAT A LIKENESS YOU VERY MUCH WISH TO TAKE YOU WOULD ALWAYS SUCCEED IN SAID MR LENNOX
MR HALE ANSWERED I DARE SAY I AM TALKING IN GREAT IGNORANCE
THE PARSONAGE WAS SO ALTERED BOTH INSIDE AND OUT THAT THE REAL PAIN WAS LESS THAN SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
TOWARDS EVENING ESPECIALLY AS SHE BECAME MORE AND MORE ANXIOUS THAT HER FATHER SHOULD FIND A SOOTHING WELCOME HOME AWAITING HIM AFTER HIS RETURN FROM HIS DAY OF FATIGUE AND DISTRESS
FOR TO THE LAST WHETHER IT WAS RIGHT OR WRONG PROPER OR IMPROPER SHE COULD NOT SETTLE TO HER OWN SATISFACTION TILL MARGARET'S SAFE RETURN THE HAPPY FULFILMENT OF THE PROJECT GAVE HER DECISION ENOUGH TO SAY SHE WAS SURE IT HAD BEEN A VERY KIND THOUGHT OF MR BELL'S AND JUST WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN WISHING FOR MARGARET AS GIVING HER THE VERY CHANGE WHICH SHE REQUIRED AFTER ALL THE ANXIOUS TIME SHE HAD HAD CHAPTER XLVI ONCE AND NOW SO ON THOSE HAPPY DAYS OF YORE OFT AS I DARE TO DWELL ONCE MORE STILL MUST I MISS THE FRIENDS SO TRIED WHOM DEATH HAS SEVERED FROM MY SIDE
RICHARD RICHARD YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME SOONER AND THEN IN TEARS MARGARET LEFT HER AS SHE RUSHED UP-STAIRS TO THROW HERSELF ON HER BED AND HIDE HER FACE IN THE PILLOWS TO STIFLE THE HYSTERIC SOBS THAT WOULD FORCE THEIR WAY AT LAST AFTER THE RIGID SELF-CONTROL OF THE WHOLE DAY
STEP IN HERE
FREDERICK'S GRIEF WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN OR HEARD
NOW ONCE FOR ALL SHE WOULD CONSIDER THEM AND APPOINT TO EACH OF THEM ITS RIGHT WORK IN HER LIFE
THEY ARE ALWAYS TRYING AT IT
BUT IN AN INSTANT SHE HAD CONQUERED THIS FEELING AND MODESTLY ADVANCED MEETING MANY A BRIGHT GLANCE OF RECOGNITION AND HEARING MANY A HALF-SUPPRESSED MURMUR OF IT'S MISS HALE THE VICAR'S LADY HEARD THE NAME AND HER MANNER AT ONCE BECAME MORE KINDLY
IT WAS ALL THE DARKER FROM CONTRAST WITH THE PALE GRAY-BLUE OF THE WINTRY SKY
BUT THE FORMER GAINED THE DAY
IT WERE TH FACT THAT I WERE NA WANTED THEER NO MORE NOR ONY OTHER PLACE AS I MINDED BUT I WISH YOU HAD SEEN MR THORNTON REPEATED MARGARET
SO MANY ARRANGEMENTS DEPENDED ON THIS DECISION THAT MARGARET RESOLVED TO ASK HER FATHER ONE EVENING IN SPITE OF HIS EVIDENT FATIGUE AND LOW SPIRITS
ALTHOUGH THE DAY WAS HOT THERE BURNT A LARGE FIRE IN THE GRATE MAKING THE WHOLE PLACE FEEL LIKE AN OVEN
SO MARGARET HAD TO KEEP HER PLEASURE TO HERSELF AND COULD ONLY LET IT ESCAPE BY THE SAFETY-VALVE OF ASKING DIXON WHEN SHE DRESSED FOR DINNER IF SHE WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE MASTER FREDERICK AND HIS NEW WIFE VERY MUCH INDEED
CONSEQUENCE IS I DUNNOT SEE WHERE I'M TO GET A SHILLING IS THAT RULE ABOUT NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE UNION IN FORCE AT ALL THE MILLS ASKED MARGARET
HE IS HER LOVER WHOEVER HE IS
SOME WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE BETTER INSTRUCTED THAN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN
SOONER OR LATER THE MISTS WOULD BE CLEARED AWAY
MARGARET WENT HOME SO PAINFULLY OCCUPIED WITH WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AND SEEN THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO ROUSE HERSELF UP TO THE DUTIES WHICH AWAITED HER
ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MR HENRY LENNOX CHAPTER III THE MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED LEARN TO WIN A LADY'S FAITH NOBLY AS THE THING IS HIGH
WHERE WAS HE NOW
I'LL STOP WITH HER AS LONG AS I'M NEEDED AND IF YO COME TO-MORROW YO CAN HAVE A DEAL O WISE TALK WITH HER THAT SHE'S NOT UP TO TO-DAY AS MARGARET AND HER FATHER WENT SLOWLY UP THE STREET SHE PAUSED AT HIGGINS'S CLOSED DOOR
YO'VE NO BUSINESS TO GO PRYING INTO WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN BOUCHER AND ME
I PROMISED COUNSEL AND ADVICE SUCH AS I WOULD GIVE TO MY OWN DAUGHTER
I WILL WRITE A NOTE WITH IT AND SHE SATE DOWN HASTILY AS IF AFRAID OF THINKING AND WROTE
HER SON SATE BY THE TABLE HIS ARMS THROWN HALF ACROSS IT HIS HEAD BENT FACE DOWNWARDS
HE STOOD WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED
IT WAS SUCH A CHARMING SNATCHED FORBIDDEN THING BUT SHE SUDDENLY STOPPED SPEAKING
MARGARET BENT OVER HER BOOK AND SEEING NOTHING BUT THAT--HEARING THE BUZZ OF CHILDREN'S VOICES OLD TIMES ROSE UP AND SHE THOUGHT OF THEM AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS TILL ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A PAUSE--ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS STUMBLING OVER THE APPARENTLY SIMPLE WORD A UNCERTAIN WHAT TO CALL IT
THE TEA WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT BUT FOR FANNY'S PERPETUAL DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN FEELINGS
SHE DIMPLED AND BLUSHED MOST BECOMINGLY WHEN INTRODUCED TO MR BELL CONSCIOUS THAT SHE HAD HER REPUTATION AS A BEAUTY TO KEEP UP AND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO HAVE A MORDECAI REFUSING TO WORSHIP AND ADMIRE EVEN IN THE SHAPE OF AN OLD FELLOW OF A COLLEGE WHICH NOBODY HAD EVER HEARD OF
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL NOT TO TRIUMPH OVER ME SAID MR BELL
THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE ABOUT AT THE STATIONS IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE TOO LAZILY CONTENT TO WISH TO TRAVEL
MR HEPWORTH IS SPENDING AN IMMENSE DEAL OF MONEY ON THIS HOUSE
SO NOW YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE YO SPOKE OF MY WISDOM THIS MORNING
NORTH AN SOUTH HAVE EACH GETTEN THEIR OWN TROUBLES
I KNOW HE DRAWS AND THAT WILL TAKE HIM OUT OF YOUR WAY MAMMA
HE HAS TO ATTEND A PUPIL AT THIS HOUR
WE MUST GIVE THEM LINE AND LETTER FOR THE WAY WE CHOOSE TO SPEND OR SAVE OUR MONEY
ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE SOME DOUBTS WERE IMPLIED SOME DIFFICULTIES NAMED BY MR SLICKSON WHO TOOK HOLD OF MR THORNTON'S ARM THE BETTER TO IMPRESS HIS WORDS
MR BELL SAID SHE A LITTLE SURPRISED
JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER THAT SPEECH OF FANNY'S DID NO HARM
HOW KIND OF HIM TO THINK OF ME
AND THEN TITTERED A LOW AND BITTER LAUGH
THERE'S A PACK O WOMEN WHO WON'T LET ME AT HER
WHILE YET HE WAS THE PLEASANTEST MAN THE MOST SYMPATHISING FRIEND THE PERSON OF ALL OTHERS WHO UNDERSTOOD HER BEST IN HARLEY STREET
IT NEEDED THE SHARP UNCOURTEOUS COMMAND TO MAKE HER CONQUER HER VIS INERTIAE AND ALLOW HERSELF TO BE PACKED BY HER MAID AFTER THE LATTER HAD COMPLETED THE BOXES
MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER AND TOOK HER UNRESISTING HEAD ON HER BREAST BENDING HER OWN SOFT CHEEKS DOWN CARESSINGLY TO TOUCH HER FACE
BUT I DO WANT YOU SO MUCH TO COME HERE MARGARET
WILLIAMS MUST TAKE THE WATER-BED SHE CAME TO ASK FOR
AND YET IT WAS DESIRABLE TO MAKE ALL NOISES AS DISTANT AS POSSIBLE FROM MRS HALE'S ROOM
IF THE TRAIN HAD NOT BEEN THERE AT THE MOMENT THE MAN WOULD HAVE JUMPED UP AGAIN AND CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE TO ARREST HIM
LAST NIGHT ONLY
HE WHILE HE BLAMED HER--WHILE HE WAS JEALOUS OF HER--WHILE HE RENOUNCED HER--HE LOVED HER SORELY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
HE'S TWO CHAPS
THEN DRAWING HIMSELF UP INTO DETERMINED COMPOSURE AND DIGNITY HE SAID I WILL NOT SAY ANY MORE THAN THIS WHICH IS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE SIMPLE TRUTH AND I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME,--I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MISS HALE IS IN SOME STRAIT AND DIFFICULTY CONNECTED WITH AN ATTACHMENT WHICH OF ITSELF FROM MY KNOWLEDGE OF MISS HALE'S CHARACTER IS PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND RIGHT
THAT IN FACT EVERY ONE WHO RULES HIMSELF TO DECENCY AND SOBRIETY OF CONDUCT AND ATTENTION TO HIS DUTIES COMES OVER TO OUR RANKS
IF THERE WERE TO BE A COURT-MARTIAL AND YOU COULD FIND YOUR WITNESSES YOU MIGHT AT ANY RATE SHOW HOW YOUR DISOBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY WAS BECAUSE THAT AUTHORITY WAS UNWORTHILY EXERCISED MR HALE ROUSED HIMSELF UP TO LISTEN TO HIS SON'S ANSWER
THE WHITE SAIL OF A DISTANT BOAT TURNING SILVER IN SOME PALE SUNBEAM:--IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD DREAM HER LIFE AWAY IN SUCH LUXURY OF PENSIVENESS IN WHICH SHE MADE HER PRESENT ALL IN ALL FROM NOT DARING TO THINK OF THE PAST OR WISHING TO CONTEMPLATE THE FUTURE
IT'S A VERY GOOD MARRIAGE FOR ALL HE'S GOT SUCH GRAY HAIR AT THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION MARGARET WAS SILENT LONG ENOUGH FOR MARTHA TO RECOVER HER PROPRIETY AND WITH IT HER HABITUAL SHORTNESS OF ANSWER
NOT A MAN ON US WILL GO IN FOR LESS WAGE THAN TH UNION SAYS IS OUR DUE
SHE HAS ALL THE BEAUTIFUL INDIAN SHAWLS AND SCARFS THE GENERAL GAVE TO ME BUT WHICH I SHALL NEVER WEAR AGAIN SHE IS A LUCKY GIRL REPLIED ANOTHER VOICE WHICH MARGARET KNEW TO BE THAT OF MRS GIBSON A LADY WHO WAS TAKING A DOUBLE INTEREST IN THE CONVERSATION FROM THE FACT OF ONE OF HER DAUGHTERS HAVING BEEN MARRIED WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS
I HAVE A GOOD POSITION--THE CHANCE OF A BETTER CONTINUED HE REDDENING LIKE A GIRL
ONLY IF YOU COULD SEE HIS SHOES I'M SURE YOU'D SAY THE KITCHEN WAS THE FITTER PLACE
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT HER
SHE HAD NEVER COME FAIRLY IN CONTACT WITH THE TASTE THAT LOVES ORNAMENT HOWEVER BAD MORE THAN THE PLAINNESS AND SIMPLICITY WHICH ARE OF THEMSELVES THE FRAMEWORK OF ELEGANCE
AND AS FOR EDITH THE REGIMENT WON'T REMAIN MUCH LONGER IN CORFU
WHAT ABOUT IT WHY SIR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE GOT A PRETTY DISTINCT CHAIN OF EVIDENCE INCULPATING A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS WALKING WITH MISS HALE THAT NIGHT AT THE OUTWOOD STATION AS THE MAN WHO STRUCK OR PUSHED LEONARDS OFF THE PLATFORM AND SO CAUSED HIS DEATH
I COULD NOT SPEAK AGAINST HER WELL
ALTHOUGH THE INSTANT SHE SAW THE HAND HALF PUT OUT QUICKLY DRAWN BACK SHE WAS SORRY SHE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF THE INTENTION
A LETTER TO EDITH A GOOD PIECE OF DANTE A VISIT TO THE HIGGINSES
JANE HAS REFUSED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE COWARDLY WOMAN
OTHERWISE YOU KNOW THERE IS NO ONE WHO CARES LESS FOR EATING THAN I DO
THEN SOMETIMES THE TURF IS AS SOFT AND FINE AS VELVET
ASK WHOM YOU CHOOSE
WHAT TIME WHAT CIRCUIT FIRST I ASK NOT
BUT WHAT NONSENSE THAT COULD MEAN SHE DIDN'T KNOW
BEFORE THEN,--MY VISITS WHICH OF COURSE I SHALL REPEAT FROM TIME TO TIME ALTHOUGH I FEAR I CAN DO NOTHING BUT ALLEVIATE,--A THOUSAND LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL HAVE OCCURRED TO AWAKEN HIS ALARM TO DEEPEN IT--SO THAT HE WILL BE ALL THE BETTER PREPARED.--NAY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY--NAY MY DEAR--I SAW MR THORNTON AND I HONOUR YOUR FATHER FOR THE SACRIFICE HE HAS MADE HOWEVER MISTAKEN I MAY BELIEVE HIM TO BE.--WELL THIS ONCE IF IT WILL PLEASE YOU MY DEAR
AND AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER TAUNTING WORDS HIS BROW GREW STERN THOUGH HIS HEART BEAT THICK WITH LONGING LOVE
MR THORNTON WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE SURPRISED AND DISCOMFITED THAN SHE
I'LL COME BEFORE TEA
LET US NEVER NAME HER WITH ALL MY HEART
SHE KEPT HERSELF BALANCED BY CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER ROUND HER KNEES
IT HAD A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN AS DIFFERENT FROM THE LITTLE BATHING-PLACES IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AS THEY AGAIN FROM THOSE OF THE CONTINENT
HENRY WILL LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
THEN SAID I THERE'S AS GOOD A MAN GONE AS EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH LET WHO WILL BE T OTHER AND I CAME TO SEE YO AND TELL YO HOW GRIEVED I WERE BUT THEM WOMEN IN TH KITCHEN WOULDN'T TELL YO I WERE THERE
MYSELF FOR ONE
DO YOU KNOW EDITH I SOMETIMES THINK YOUR CORFU LIFE HAS TAUGHT YOU WELL JUST A SHADE OR TWO OF COARSENESS EDITH BEGAN TO SOB SO BITTERLY AND TO DECLARE SO VEHEMENTLY THAT MARGARET HAD LOST ALL LOVE FOR HER AND NO LONGER LOOKED UPON HER AS A FRIEND THAT MARGARET CAME TO THINK THAT SHE HAD EXPRESSED TOO HARSH AN OPINION FOR THE RELIEF OF HER OWN WOUNDED PRIDE AND ENDED BY BEING EDITH'S SLAVE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO OUTLIVE ME BY MANY A LONG YEAR
BUT MONEY IS NOT WHAT I STRIVE FOR WHAT THEN IT IS A HOME QUESTION
I KNOW NOTHING
SHE HAS SPOKEN TO ME SINCE BUT ALL THE BLOOD IN HIS BODY SEEMED TO RUSH INWARDS TO HIS HEART AS HE SPOKE AND HE ABSOLUTELY TREMBLED
EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE STOPPED TO LISTEN
AND SAYING I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE IT HE TURNED AWAY AND NEVER SPOKE TO HER AGAIN UNTIL HE BID HER A FORMAL GOOD NIGHT AS MR LENNOX TOOK HIS DEPARTURE MARGARET SAID WITH A BLUSH THAT SHE COULD NOT REPRESS AND WITH SOME HESITATION CAN I SPEAK TO YOU TO-MORROW
AND ALTHOUGH MARGARET WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO KNOW IF HER SUSPICIONS WERE RIGHT AND IT HAD BEEN MR THORNTON WHO HAD MADE THE ENQUIRY SHE COULD NOT ASK THE QUESTION OF MR BELL MUCH AS SHE LONGED TO DO SO
SURELY HE DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE THINKS DIFFERENTLY--THAT HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THE CHURCH MARGARET SHOOK HER HEAD AND THE TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AS HER MOTHER TOUCHED THE BARE NERVE OF HER OWN REGRET
HOW DID SHE GET THERE NAY MISS THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANSWERED JANE WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HER HEAD
MILTON DIDN'T AGREE WITH HER I IMAGINE
SAW LESS OF POWER IN ITS PUBLIC EFFECT AND AS IT HAPPENED SHE WAS THROWN WITH ONE OR TWO OF THOSE WHO IN ALL MEASURES AFFECTING MASSES OF PEOPLE MUST BE ACUTE SUFFERERS FOR THE GOOD OF MANY
AND MRS THORNTON HAD CLOTHES-BASKET UPON CLOTHES-BASKET FULL OF TABLE-CLOTHS AND NAPKINS BROUGHT IN AND BEGAN TO RECKON UP THE STORE
IT WAS LATER THAN SHE FANCIED FOR IN THE AGITATION OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO WIND UP HER WATCH
AND YET IT WAS MUCH
COME ALONG SAID HE AND HIS TONE WAS ROUGHER THAN BEFORE
I AM RESIGNED
MOST FINE FOLK TIRE MY EYES OUT WI THEIR COLOURS
BECAUSE EVERY MAN HAS HAD TO STAND IN AN UNCHRISTIAN AND ISOLATED POSITION APART FROM AND JEALOUS OF HIS BROTHER-MAN
TO THINK OF THE VICAR BEING DEAD
YOU MUST PERCEIVE WHAT I CANNOT BUT THINK MARGARET WAS SILENT
SHE WAS SURE MARGARET WOULD NEVER REGAIN HER LOST STRENGTH WHILE SHE STAYED IN MILTON
AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB-HIRE
OH IT IS THIS--DEAREST MARGARET!--YOU MUST COME AND SEE ME
NO I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD ANSWERED HIS MOTHER
BUT IS IT TRUE
THEY COULD NOT GIVE UP THEIR FARMS ALL IN A MINUTE HOWEVER MUCH THEY MIGHT WISH TO DO SO
I AM INDEED MOST UNFORTUNATE YES SAID SHE WITH RECOVERED DIGNITY
ONLY REMEMBER WE SHALL HAVE MUCH LESS MONEY TO SPEND THEY HAD NEVER HAD MUCH SUPERFLUITY AS MARGARET KNEW
HAD YOU NOT BETTER GO UPSTAIRS MISS HALE MARGARET'S LIPS FORMED A NO!'--BUT HE COULD NOT HEAR HER SPEAK FOR THE TRAMP OF INNUMERABLE STEPS RIGHT UNDER THE VERY WALL OF THE HOUSE AND THE FIERCE GROWL OF LOW DEEP ANGRY VOICES THAT HAD A FEROCIOUS MURMUR OF SATISFACTION IN THEM MORE DREADFUL THAN THEIR BAFFLED CRIES NOT MANY MINUTES BEFORE
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING TO DO ONE GOOD AFTER A DAY LIKE THIS CHAPTER XXXVII LOOKING SOUTH A SPADE
ALL HE HAD SAID WAS THAT HE HALF-THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO AND HEAR FOR HIMSELF WHAT FREDERICK HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE MUTINY
LEAVING HIGGINS BAFFLED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR
I MYSELF HEARD MISS HALE SAY SHE COULD NOT PLAY
BUT SHE PUSHED THIS NOTION ON ONE SIDE WITH THE SICK WILFULNESS OF A CHILD
SO I SHALL ONLY CONSIDER IT AS BORROWED FROM YOU AND MARGARET DON'T DO THAT SAID MARGARET
HE HAD LEFT HIS SLEEPING WIFE
SHE RAMBLED AT FIRST
MANY A MISSY YOUNG LADY WOULD HAVE SHRUNK FROM GIVING AN OLD WOMAN THE PLEASURE OF HEARING THAT HER SON WAS WELL SPOKEN OF WHY ASKED MARGARET LOOKING STRAIGHT AT MRS THORNTON IN BEWILDERMENT
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT HE IS LIKE SAID MARGARET LAZILY
DO YOU THINK SHE IS REALLY VERY ILL
THAT'S ALL
THAT'S ALL
OVER BABBLING BROOKS THEY TOOK IMPOSSIBLE LEAPS WHICH SEEMED TO KEEP THEM WHOLE DAYS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR
AT TIMES SHE CRIED A GOOD DEAL
YOUR MOTHER LOOKS SADLY TIRED TO-NIGHT MARGARET MARGARET HAD NOTICED HER MOTHER'S JADED APPEARANCE WITH ANXIETY FOR SOME TIME PAST AND THIS REMARK OF HER FATHER'S SENT HER UP TO BED WITH A DIM FEAR LYING LIKE A WEIGHT ON HER HEART
AND HE WON'T WANT ANY AMUSEMENT BEYOND TALKING TO PAPA
SATE WITH HIS WIFE IN HER DRESSING-ROOM AN HOUR OR TWO EVERY DAY
NOT AN ART TO BE ACQUIRED POETA NASCITUR NON FIT MURMURED MR HALE
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE OUT ALL WEATHERS
MY THOUGHTS WAS OTHERWISE OCCUPIED IN THINKING OF MY POOR OF MRS HALE PAPA SAID MARGARET IT IS THIS SUSPENSE THAT IS BAD FOR YOU BOTH
DELICIOUS
PLANS WHICH HAD LATELY APPEARED TO HER IN THE GUISE OF TASKS NOW APPEARED LIKE PLEASURES
AND HE KNOWING NOTHING OF IT SOME ONE HAD TO GO AND TELL HIM OR HE WAS A DEAD MAN AND IT NEEDED TO BE A WOMAN,--SO I WENT
BUT NOW HE HAS STRUCKEN ME I COULD DO IT LESS NOR EVER FOR IT WOULD BE GETTING OTHER MEN TO TAKE UP MY QUARREL
IT HAS NOT LOST THE TRICK OF BEING ELOQUENT I DID NOT LIKE SAID MARGARET HASTILY HIS WAY OF ADVOCATING WHAT HE KNEW TO BE WRONG--SO GLARINGLY WRONG--EVEN IN JEST BUT IT WAS VERY CLEVER
BUT AT THE SOUND OF THE LATCH HE TURNED QUICKLY ROUND
HIS WHOLE MANNER AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AND ENTERTAINER OF HIS FRIENDS WAS SO STRAIGHTFORWARD YET SIMPLE AND MODEST AS TO BE THOROUGHLY DIGNIFIED
HER HEAD FOR ALL ITS DROOPING EYES WAS THROWN A LITTLE BACK IN THE OLD PROUD ATTITUDE
BECAUSE HE HAS BROUGHT IN SUCH A PLEASANT PIECE OF NEWS I RETRACT ALL I SAID JUST NOW
THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD-BYES OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE
HE COULD NOT BEAR IT AS I CAN AND BY WAY OF PROVING HOW WELL SHE BORE IT SHE BURST INTO TEARS
AND HE SUBMITTED TO IT GIVING HER A LITTLE PUSH AWAY WHEN SHE HAD DONE AS IF HER AFFECTION DISTURBED HIM FROM HIS ABSORPTION IN THE DEAD
YOU THINK YOU NEVER HEARD OF THIS WONDERFUL SON OF MINE MISS HALE
YET NOT FOR HIS SAKE
NOT HER FATHER'S DESPONDING ATTITUDE HAD POWER TO DAMP HER NOW
WHY TO HAMPER'S
INDEED WHAT SHE HAD SAID THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD PREPARED HER FATHER FOR SO MUCH WORSE A STATE OF THINGS THAT BY A REACTION OF HIS IMAGINATION HE DESCRIBED ALL AS BETTER THAN IT REALLY WAS
YOU WOULD ONLY THINK ME A CHURL IF YOU HAD FOR I SHOULD DECLINE IT I BELIEVE IN SPITE OF ALL THE TEMPTATIONS OF SUCH AGREEABLE COMPANY SAID MR BELL BOWING ALL ROUND AND SECRETLY CONGRATULATING HIMSELF ON THE NEAT TURN HE HAD GIVEN TO HIS SENTENCE WHICH IF PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THIS EFFECT
THEN SHE KNIT HER BROWS AND PINCHED AND COMPRESSED HER LIPS TIGHT AND CAREFULLY UNPICKED THE G
IF YOU'LL ONLY COME TO OXFORD MARGARET I WILL SHOW YOU A PLACE TO GLORY IN WELL SAID MR HALE MR THORNTON IS COMING TO DRINK TEA WITH US TO-NIGHT AND HE IS AS PROUD OF MILTON AS YOU OF OXFORD
AND HAD MET WITH EXACTLY THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH IN THESE WISE MOODS HE HAD ALWAYS FORE-TOLD WERE CERTAIN TO FOLLOW IF HE EVER DID MAKE SUCH A FOOL OF HIMSELF
HIS GREAT EYES STARTLED OPEN BY THE NEWS HE HAD HEARD AS HE CAME ALONG THE COURT FROM MANY BUSY TONGUES
BUT WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THESE FREAKS OF HERS WERE REGARDED AS INTERRUPTIONS TO THE SERIOUS BUSINESS AND AS SUCH ANNOYED HER MOTHER SHE BECAME GRAVE AND SEDATE
FANNY
MARGARET DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY
A WARM SOBER BREADTH OF COLOURING WELL RELIEVED BY THE DEAR OLD HELSTONE CHINTZ-CURTAINS AND CHAIR COVERS
BUT SHE COULD HAVE LAUGHED AT HERSELF FOR MINDING THIS CHANGE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY WHAT WAS A MORE SERIOUS ANNOYANCE
SO HE SEEMED TO YIELD AT FIRST WHEN THE DEPUTATION CAME TO HIM,--AND OF COURSE HE ONLY CONFIRMED THEM IN THEIR FOLLY AS HE MEANT TO DO
MRS HALE'S DRESSING-ROOM WAS LEFT UNTOUCHED TO THE LAST
SHE HANDED HIM HIS CUP OF TEA WITH THE PROUD AIR OF AN UNWILLING SLAVE
SOME TIME IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I MAY SIT OVER THE FIRE AND LOOKING INTO THE EMBERS SEE THE LIFE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALL THIS TIME SHE WAS HASTILY PUTTING ON HER THINGS TO GO OUT ONLY STOPPING FROM TIME TO TIME TO WIPE HER EYES WITH AN IMPATIENCE OF GESTURE AT THE TEARS THAT WOULD COME IN SPITE OF ALL HER BRAVERY
I RECKON IF THEY HEARD HIM THEY'D TELL HIM IF I COTCHED EM ONE BY ONE HE MIGHT GO BACK AND GET WHAT HE COULD FOR HIS WORK EVEN IF IT WEREN'T SO MUCH AS THEY ORDERED MARGARET SAT UTTERLY SILENT
HE CAUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S LAST WORDS
THAT'S ENOUGH SO IT IS
NOT SHE
THE MYSTERY THAT MARGARET HOPED THEIR LATE HABITS OF INTIMACY HAD BROKEN THROUGH WAS RESUMED
MAMMA WON'T LIKE IT AT ALL
BEFORE THE VACATION ENDS I THINK I SHALL PAY YOU A CALL AND SEE WHAT YOU REALLY DO EMPLOY YOURSELF IN I HOPE YOU WILL
AND AS FOR MASTER HIS BOOKS ARE COMPANY ENOUGH FOR HIM IF HE SHOULD COME IN I WILL GO SAID MARGARET
THE GARDEN THE GRASS-PLAT FORMERLY SO DAINTILY TRIM THAT EVEN A STRAY ROSE-LEAF SEEMED LIKE A FLECK ON ITS EXQUISITE ARRANGEMENT AND PROPRIETY WAS STREWED WITH CHILDREN'S THINGS
I THOUGHT A THE GOOD-DOING WAS ON THE SIDE OF GENTLE FOLK
SHE CAME DOWN READY EQUIPPED IN A BRISKER MOOD THAN USUAL
I DARE SAY PAPA WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME BEFORE NOW IF I HAD CARED
SHE SPOKE NOT A WORD BUT STOLE TO BED AFTER HER FATHER HAD LEFT HER LIKE A CHILD ASHAMED OF ITS FAULT
HOW FAR IS HESTON FROM MILTON
MRS THORNTON WRENCHED IT AWAY WITH NO GENTLE HAND
AND IT SPOKE ON EM AS IF THEY WAS VARTUES OR VICES
FOR THE QUESTION OF INQUEST OR NO INQUEST HAD HUNG TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE
SHE TRIED TO SMILE BACK IN REPLY TO HER FATHER'S ANXIOUS LOOKS AND WORDS OF TENDER ENQUIRY
AND AWAY SHE WENT
IF YOU WILL FORGIVE THIS LIBERTY,--MY ROUGH WAYS,--TOO ABRUPT I FEAR--BUT I WILL BE MORE GENTLE NEXT TIME
AND SHE TO BE OUR HOUSEKEEPER--THE VILLAGE LADY BOUNTIFUL--BY DAY
HE WAS SHARP TO THE HOUR AT THE MEETING OF HIS BROTHER MAGISTRATES,--GIVING THEM THE BEST ASSISTANCE OF HIS STRONG SENSE AND HIS POWER OF SEEING CONSEQUENCES AT A GLANCE AND SO COMING TO A RAPID DECISION
BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT
WHY BLESS ME EXCLAIMED SHE AS AT THE END OF HER APOLOGY A GLINT OF SUNLIGHT SHOWED HER MARGARET'S FACE HITHERTO UNOBSERVED IN THAT SHADY PARLOUR
IT IS VERY BAD--BUT I SEE YOU MUST
I WON'T URGE MY WISH AGAINST YOUR WILL IF HE DOES MR BELL COULD NOT COME
EDITH'S ASTONISHMENT AND HER AUNT SHAW'S DISMAY WOULD HAVE TO BE MET BRAVELY WHEN THEIR LETTERS CAME
BUT I THINK IT WERE A GREATER CRIME TO LET IT ALONE
SHE WENT DOWN-STAIRS AND LISTENED AT THE STUDY DOOR
STILL AS THEY MADE WAY FOR HER AND WRAPT UP IN THE PURPOSE OF HER ERRAND AND THE NECESSITIES THAT SUGGESTED IT SHE WAS LESS QUICK OF OBSERVATION THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF HER MIND HAD BEEN AT EASE SHE HAD GOT INTO MARLBOROUGH STREET BEFORE THE FULL CONVICTION FORCED ITSELF UPON HER THAT THERE WAS A RESTLESS OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF IRRITATION ABROAD AMONG THE PEOPLE
JOHN SAID HIS MOTHER THIS LADY IS MRS SHAW MISS HALE'S AUNT
YOUR NAME IS HALE I BELIEVE IN AN INSTANT--HOW MARGARET DID NOT SEE FOR EVERYTHING DANCED BEFORE HER EYES--BUT BY SOME SLEIGHT OF WRESTLING FREDERICK HAD TRIPPED HIM UP AND HE FELL FROM THE HEIGHT OF THREE OR FOUR FEET WHICH THE PLATFORM WAS ELEVATED ABOVE THE SPACE OF SOFT GROUND BY THE SIDE OF THE RAILROAD
AND WHAT PROOF MORE WOULD YOU HAVE I WONDER OF HER CARING FOR YOU
HE NEVER WENT ON WITH ANY SUBJECT BUT GAVE LITTLE SHORT ABRUPT ANSWERS VERY MUCH TO THE POINT THOUGH I SHOULD THINK
MASTER SAID HE YO'D NOT GUESS EASY WHAT I'VE BEEN TRAMPING AFTER TO-DAY
ONE OF HIS CHUMS TOLD ME AS MUCH
AND WHEN HE IS HE NEVER SPEAKS ABOUT IT OR MAKES IT AN EXCUSE FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING
AND OH FOR HER SAKE HOW GLAD WE OUGHT TO BE
BUT VERY POORLY I'M AFRAID I'VE NO CHANCE O BEING WELL SAID SHE QUERULOUSLY
AND NOW THAT FREDERICK HAS GIVEN UP ALL HOPE AND ALMOST ALL WISH OF EVER CLEARING HIMSELF AND RETURNING TO ENGLAND IT WOULD BE ONLY DOING MYSELF JUSTICE TO HAVE ALL THIS EXPLAINED
IT WAS A JUST CONSEQUENCE OF HER SIN THAT ALL EXCUSES FOR IT ALL TEMPTATION TO IT SHOULD REMAIN FOR EVER UNKNOWN TO THE PERSON IN WHOSE OPINION IT HAD SUNK HER LOWEST
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE VERY POOR,--AT LEAST THEY DON'T SPEAK AS IF THEY WERE
THEY PASSED QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE-PLACE UPSTAIRS AND INTO THE QUIET PRESENCE OF THE DEAD
BUT SHE WERE GETTING SUCH A HANDY GIRL THAT I MISS HER SORE
TELL ME ABOUT IT SAID BESSY
HIS QUICK SUSPICIONS WERE AROUSED BY THIS DULL ECHO OF HER FORMER DENIAL
HE COULD NOT EVEN USE WORDS EFFECTIVELY ENOUGH TO BE A SUCCESSFUL BEGGAR I USED THE COMPARISON SUGGESTED BY MISS HALE OF THE POSITION OF THE MASTER TO THAT OF A PARENT
MR BELL BLEW HIS NOSE OSTENTATIOUSLY BEFORE ANSWERING
HE TOOK IT UP AND READ IT THROUGH
A STRANGE SORT OF MORTIFIED COMPARISON OF FANNY WITH HER WENT ON IN MRS THORNTON'S MIND
THE FATHER AND BROTHER DEPENDED UPON HER
SHE SAW NOTHING BUT HER SON A LITTLE PALER A LITTLE STERNER THAN USUAL
YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE OH YES
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT YOU DID
BUT THESE TWO DAYS HAD SET HER UP AFRESH WITH NEW STRENGTH AND BRIGHTER HOPE
BUT I HEARD OF YOU SO FAR AWAY IN THE HIGHLANDS THAT I NEVER THOUGHT HAMPSHIRE COULD COME IN
MR HALE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO DELIVER A COURSE OF LECTURES AT SOME OF THE INSTITUTIONS BUT HE CONTEMPLATED DOING THIS SO MUCH AS AN EFFORT OF DUTY AND WITH SO LITTLE OF THE GENIAL IMPULSE OF LOVE TOWARDS HIS WORK AND ITS END THAT MARGARET WAS SURE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE WELL DONE UNTIL HE COULD LOOK UPON IT WITH SOME KIND OF ZEST
MAY I AGAIN ASK YOU MISS HALE FROM WHOSE ACCOUNT YOU FORMED YOUR FAVOURABLE OPINION OF HIM
ONLY THE DAY BEFORE MR HALE HAD BEEN RECKONING UP WITH DISMAY HOW MUCH THEIR REMOVAL AND FORTNIGHT AT HESTON HAD COST AND HE FOUND IT HAD ABSORBED NEARLY ALL HIS LITTLE STOCK OF READY MONEY
THE GENTLEMAN WAS GONE SO QUICKLY I HAD NO TIME TO TELL HIM
HE THOUGHT THAT HE DISLIKED SEEING ONE WHO HAD MORTIFIED HIM SO KEENLY
HE WAS ALMOST AS ANXIOUS TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE AS SHE WAS FOR HIM TO LEAVE
YOU HAVE NEVER DESCRIBED IT TO ME
BUT HIS FACE STRIKES ME AS ANXIOUS I SHOULD BE IF I WERE HE
I REALLY BELIEVE IT IS AS SHE SAYS MR LOWE REPLIED
AND AS FOR HANDS--MARGARET HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU SAY YOU HAD WASHED YOUR HANDS THIS MORNING BEFORE TWELVE O'CLOCK
AND WHY SHE HAD DONE IT
THE FINE-GRAINED SKIN THE OVAL CHEEK THE RICH OUTLINE OF HER MOUTH ITS CORNERS DEEP SET IN DIMPLES,--WERE ALL WAN AND PALE TO-DAY
I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO PREJUDICED MR HALE HAD BEEN PEELING A PEACH FOR HIS WIFE
IT SEEMS SO TERRIBLE SO SHOCKING SAID MARGARET SUDDENLY BURSTING INTO TEARS
ON FRIDAY EVENING WE WALKED UP TO HAMPSTEAD AND BACK
FOR THE ACTIVE VICAR KEPT HIS EYE ON THE ROAD EVEN DURING THE COMPOSITION OF HIS MOST ORTHODOX SERMONS AND HAD A HAT AND STICK HANGING READY AT HAND TO SEIZE BEFORE SALLYING OUT AFTER HIS PARISHIONERS WHO HAD NEED OF QUICK LEGS IF THEY COULD TAKE REFUGE IN THE JOLLY FORESTER BEFORE THE TEETOTAL VICAR HAD ARRESTED THEM
AND THEY CHUCKLED INWARDLY AT THE IDEA OF THE WORKMEN'S DISCOMFITURE AND DEFEAT IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO ALTER ONE IOTA OF WHAT THORNTON HAD DECREED
SHE NOW SPOKE TO THE GIRL AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF TENDER PITY IN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE DID SO THAT WENT RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE FATHER
I WERE LOTH TO LET HER GO
IT MIGHT BE A POOR CHANCE BUT IT WOULD BE A CHANCE HE LOOKED UP AGAIN WITH A SHARP GLANCE AT THE QUESTIONER
SHE CAUGHT AT FREDERICK'S ARM AND CLUTCHED IT TIGHT WHILE A STERN THOUGHT COMPRESSED HER BROWS AND CAUSED HER TO SET HER TEETH
WHERE UNTIL NOW THE OLD SERVANT HAD BEEN BUSILY ENGAGED IN WINDING UP ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HALE FAMILY
COME WITH ME SHE SAID
YOU HAVE MADE A STRANGE MISTAKE AND ONE THAT I AM SURE YOUR OWN GOOD FEELING WILL MAKE YOU SORRY FOR WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT DIXON HUNG IRRESOLUTELY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THE SLICKSONS ACCEPT COLLINGBROOKS ACCEPT STEPHENSES ACCEPT BROWNS DECLINE
BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT THE CHILD WAS GETTING A BETTER AND SIMPLER AND MORE NATURAL EDUCATION STOPPING AT HOME AND HELPING HER MOTHER AND LEARNING TO READ A CHAPTER IN THE NEW TESTAMENT EVERY NIGHT BY HER SIDE THAN FROM ALL THE SCHOOLING UNDER THE SUN MARGARET DID NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO GO ON BY REPLYING TO HIM AND SO PROLONGING THE DISCUSSION BEFORE THE MOTHER
HE CLASPED HER CLOSE
BUT I'VE PLENTY OF GRAND GOWNS,--A WEEK AGO I SHOULD HAVE SAID THEY WERE FAR TOO GRAND FOR ANYTHING I SHOULD EVER WANT AGAIN
MR LENNOX SAW NOW THAT HE HAD ANNOYED HIS COMPANION
AND SOME DINNER OR MORNING ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AUNT AND COUSINS WHICH LEFT MARGARET FREE IT IS TRUE BUT RATHER WEARIED WITH THE INACTIVITY OF THE DAY COMING UPON DEPRESSED SPIRITS AND DELICATE HEALTH
AND WITH MANY AN INJUNCTION TO MARGARET TO BE CAREFUL OF HERSELF AND NOT TO CATCH ANY FEVER SUCH AS WAS ALWAYS LURKING IN SUCH PLACES HER AUNT PERMITTED HER TO GO WHERE SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN BEFORE WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRECAUTION OR REQUIRING ANY PERMISSION
I HAD NO CONSCIENCE OR THOUGHT BUT TO SAVE FREDERICK I SAY IT WAS RIGHT
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU IN DIXON'S ARMS I SAID DEAR WHAT AN UGLY LITTLE THING AND SHE SAID IT'S NOT EVERY CHILD THAT'S LIKE MASTER FRED BLESS HIM DEAR
THE EVENINGS WERE CHILLY AND BY MRS SHAW'S DIRECTIONS FIRES WERE LIGHTED IN EVERY BEDROOM
WE WON'T THROW AWAY OUR MONEY ON ANY BUT SOME ONE FIRST-RATE
WHAT TIME IS YO'R DINNER BEFORE MARGARET COULD ANSWER HIGGINS BROKE OUT THORNTON'S
I CANNOT TELL
I SHALL REALLY BE GLAD TO LIE DOWN NO NO
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT SHE COULD BE AS SHE IS IF SHE WERE ON THE POINT OF DEATH
THAT AGAINST THE THREE OTHERS FOR CONSPIRACY FAILED
SHE READ WELL
FOR I AM INNOCENT OF ALL THE MOTIVES SHE ATTRIBUTES TO ME
HE WAS AS CALM AND GENTLE TO THE WOMEN IN HIS HOME AS EVER
DON'T DWELL SO MUCH ON THE PROPHECIES BUT READ THE CLEARER PARTS OF THE BIBLE I DARE SAY IT WOULD BE WISER
WHENEVER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF TUNE AND OUT OF TIME HIS PATIENT DEVOTION AND WATCHFULNESS CAME INTO PLAY AND MADE HIM AN ADMIRABLE NURSE
HE TORE HIS HAIR HE BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE HARD WOOD THEN HE LAY EXHAUSTED AND STUPID
I KNOW NOW THAT NO MAN WILL SUFFER BY ME
MR THORNTON MADE A HASTY STEP OR TWO FORWARDS
THE AIR--GETTING AWAY WOULD DO ME MORE GOOD THAN ANYTHING PLEADED SHE
A LETTER FROM HENRY LENNOX
I HA READ A BIT O POETRY ABOUT A PLOUGH GOING O'ER A DAISY AS MADE TEARS COME INTO MY EYES AFORE I'D OTHER CAUSE FOR CRYING
MR THORNTON WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO IRRITABLE AS HE WAS NOW IN ALL HIS LIFE LONG
HERE IS MY BOY--GOOD SON JUST MAN TENDER HEART--AND HE FAILS IN ALL HE SETS HIS MIND UPON
BY HEAVEN
BUT YO'RE NOT FIT TO HOLD HER
SHE IS ALMOST LIKE A DAUGHTER TO ME SAID MRS SHAW LOOKING FONDLY AT MARGARET
HE SPOKE TWO SHORT SENTENCES IN A LOW VOICE WATCHING HER ALL THE TIME
THE WALLS WERE PINK AND GOLD
WE ARE DINING EARLY TO-DAY AND HAVING NOTHING BUT COLD MEAT IN ORDER THAT THE SERVANTS MAY GET ON WITH THEIR IRONING
SHE WENT AND CURLED HERSELF UP ON THE WINDOW-SEAT IN THE SMALL DEEPLY-RECESSED WINDOW
HE PLACED A CHAIR FOR NICHOLAS STOOD UP TILL HE AT MR HALE'S REQUEST TOOK A SEAT
IN SUCH TOWNS IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND MARGARET HAD SEEN THE SHOPMEN WHEN NOT EMPLOYED IN THEIR BUSINESS LOUNGING A LITTLE AT THEIR DOORS ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR AND THE LOOK UP AND DOWN THE STREET
THE HARD SPADE-WORK ROBS THEIR BRAIN OF LIFE
I'LL TAKE CARE SHE COMES ACCORDINGLY MR BELL WROTE A LETTER WHICH MRS SHAW DECLARED WITH MANY TEARS TO BE SO LIKE ONE OF THE DEAR GENERAL'S WHEN HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A FIT OF THE GOUT THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS VALUE AND PRESERVE IT
MR HALE WAS ANXIOUSLY PUNCTUAL TO THE TIME SPECIFIED
I DON'T THINK THE CUT IS SO DEEP MA'AM AS IT LOOKS I WILL NOT RUN THE CHANCE
LET US KEEP TO OUR PLAN
BUT WHEN FRED CAME MAMMA WAS VERY ILL AND I WAS UNDONE WITH ANXIETY AND AFRAID TOO THAT I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO DANGER
I HAVE NO STRENGTH LEFT IN ME
THEY LOOKED AT THEIR WATCHES WERE DULY SHOCKED AND TOOK THEIR LEAVE
I'M SURE I'M ALWAYS EXPECTING TO HEAR OF HER HAVING MET WITH SOMETHING HORRIBLE AMONG ALL THOSE WRETCHED PLACES SHE POKES HERSELF INTO
I SHALL WANT TO KNOW HE IS SAFELY OFF
SLIGHT YET PERVADING ALL
HER FATHER MIGHT BE A HERETIC
HER FATHER WAS A STIFF PRESBYTERIAN WHEN I KNEW HIM
SHE WANTS ME TO SEE THIS COUSIN EDITH WHO I AM TOLD IS A GREAT BEAUTY
EVEN IN HER SLUMBER SHE HAD INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT A LENNOX WAS WORTH ROUSING HERSELF FOR
THE PLACE SO FAR AWAY FROM HOME AND COMPARATIVELY UNFREQUENTED
NOW IT'S NOT SO HERE
AY AND KEEP EM UP TOO WHEN YOU'VE FORCED EM UP
HER THOUGHTS RAN UPON THE IDEA BEFORE ENTERTAINED BUT WHICH NOW HAD ASSUMED THE STRENGTH OF A CONVICTION THAT MR THORNTON NO LONGER HELD HIS FORMER GOOD OPINION OF HER--THAT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN HER
YOU HAVE KNOWN MISS HALE FOR A LONG TIME I BELIEVE
AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM--THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS--OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH NOT VICIOUS
DON'T BE AFRAID JOHN SAID SHE KISSING HIM AS SHE WISHED HIM GOOD-NIGHT
THE INSPECTOR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
HE WISHED TO OVERTAKE HER AND SPEAK TO HER TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE HIM NOW SHE MUST KNOW HE WAS AWARE OF SOME OTHER ATTACHMENT
ONLY ONE DOES NOT LOOK FOR MUCH SAVOIR-FAIRE FROM A RESIDENT FELLOW
AND NOW COME DOWN WITH ME AND REST ON THE SOFA FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE PRIVILEGED BROTHER-IN-LAW CAME EARLY AND MARGARET REDDENING AS SHE SPOKE BEGAN TO ASK HIM THE QUESTIONS SHE WANTED TO HEAR ANSWERED ABOUT MR THORNTON
WE SHALL GO TO-MORROW
THOUGHT THAT THE BISHOP STRANGELY NEGLECTED HIS EPISCOPAL DUTIES IN NOT GIVING MR HALE A BETTER LIVING
A ROBIN WAS SINGING,--PERHAPS MARGARET THOUGHT THE VERY ROBIN THAT HER FATHER HAD SO OFTEN TALKED OF AS HIS WINTER PET AND FOR WHICH HE HAD MADE WITH HIS OWN HANDS A KIND OF ROBIN-HOUSE BY HIS STUDY-WINDOW
BOTH COURSED THE SAME THOUGHT TILL IT WAS LOST IN SADNESS
AND THE WORST WAS THAT THE COURT IN CONDEMNING THEM TO DEATH SAID THEY HAD SUFFERED THEMSELVES TO BE LED ASTRAY FROM THEIR DUTY BY THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS THEY WERE SILENT FOR A LONG TIME
MR BELL QUITE STARTLED ME WHEN HE SAID SOME IDEA OF THE KIND MR BELL
HER LAST WORDS TO MARY WERE KEEP MY FATHER FRO DRINK IT CANNA HURT HER NOW MUTTERED HE
THEIR VOICES AND TONES WERE CALM AND COLD A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE GONE AWAY AND THOUGHT THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH FRIGID INDIFFERENCE OF DEMEANOUR BETWEEN SUCH NEAR RELATIONS
HE DID HER THAT JUSTICE THOUGH ALL THE TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RELIEF TO BELIEVE HER UTTERLY UNWORTHY OF HIS ESTEEM
SUCH INTERCOURSE IS THE VERY BREATH OF LIFE
BUT A FEW MINUTES LIGHT AND CARELESS TALKING CARRIED ON AT WHATEVER EFFORT WAS A SACRIFICE WHICH HE OWED TO HIS MORTIFIED VANITY OR HIS SELF-RESPECT
I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM
MANY A ONE CALLS YOU PRETTY AND HANDSOME AND WHAT NOT
WITH A ROMANCE BLOWN TO PIECES
NOW I MUST GO
TO BE SURE NOT WOULD YO STAND IT IF THEY DID IT WOULD BE SOME VERY HARD PRESSURE THAT WOULD MAKE ME EVEN THINK OF SUBMITTING TO SUCH DICTATION THERE'S NOT THE PRESSURE ON ALL THE BROAD EARTH THAT WOULD MAKE ME SAID NICHOLAS HIGGINS
BUT ARE ALL THESE QUITE NECESSARY TROUBLES ASKED MARGARET LOOKING UP STRAIGHT AT HIM FOR AN ANSWER
BUT MARTHA LIKE ALL WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH MARGARET--EVEN DIXON HERSELF IN THE LONG RUN--FELT IT A PLEASURE AND AN HONOUR TO FORWARD ANY OF HER WISHES
CHAPTER II ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED
TO SOOTHE HER MOTHER'S ANXIETY SHE SUBMITTED TO A BASIN OF GRUEL
IT IS A GREAT STRAIT MY CHILD MARGARET SAT BY HIM IN THE COACH ALMOST SUPPORTING HIM IN HER ARMS
BUT I'LL NE'ER FORSWEAR MYSEL FOR A THE WORK THE KING COULD GI'E ME
HER SHARP DAMASCUS BLADE SEEMED OUT OF PLACE AND USELESS AMONG ROSE-LEAVES
THEN MADAM I HAVE YOUR DENIAL THAT YOU WERE THE LADY ACCOMPANYING THE GENTLEMAN WHO STRUCK THE BLOW OR GAVE THE PUSH WHICH CAUSED THE DEATH OF THIS POOR MAN A QUICK SHARP PAIN WENT THROUGH MARGARET'S BRAIN
SHE STARTED
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN SEEING DR DONALDSON AND ASKING HIM ANY QUESTIONS--HAVE YOU CHILD MARGARET DID NOT REPLY--ONLY LOOKED WISTFULLY TOWARDS HER
AND POOR LITTLE FRED WAS THE BABY THEN
HE COULD NOT SYMPATHISE WITH HER
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK FOR A MOMENT OR TWO FOR THE EMOTION SHE WAS TRYING TO KEEP DOWN
IT WAS THE ONE COMFORT IN ALL THIS MISERY
I TOO AM SORRY MY DEAR
HE IS MY FIRST OLIVE
MY DEAR WOMEN DO NOT GENERALLY GO NO
AND SO DO YOU
I WAS TOO BUSY TO THINK ABOUT ANY DEAD PEOPLE WITH THE LIVING PRESSING ALONGSIDE OF ME NECK TO NECK IN THE STRUGGLE FOR BREAD
AND I'VE WALKED MY FEET SORE WI GOING ABOUT FOR TO SEE MEN WHO WOULDN'T BE SEEN NOW THE LAW IS RAISED AGAIN US
SHE THANKED MR LENNOX VERY COURTEOUSLY FOR HIS TROUBLE
THEN SHE WENT DOWN SOFTLY THROUGH THE DARK TO THE DOOR
SHE WAS GLAD HE WAS GOING ON HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT HOWEVER MUCH SHE MIGHT GRIEVE OVER IT ON HER OWN
YO MIGHT PULL HIM AWAY WI A PITCH-FORK ERE HE'D LEAVE GO
DR FORBES SAYS IT IS JUST THE NATURAL END OF A HEART COMPLAINT
AND HE NEED NOT GO OUT EXCEPT IN THE DUSK POOR FELLOW POOR FELLOW ECHOED MRS HALE
IF I COULD ONLY PICK UP MY EVIDENCE
WHEN IT WAS OVER IT IS POSSIBLE SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD LITTLE QUALMS OF ILL-CONCEALED REGRET THAT CAPTAIN LENNOX COULD NOT HAVE UNITED IN HIS PERSON EVERYTHING THAT WAS DESIRABLE
FOR THE HOUSE PARTITIONS WERE BUT THIN AND THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOURS MIGHT EASILY HEAR HIS YOUTHFUL PASSIONATE SOBS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE SLOWER TREMBLING AGONY OF AFTER-LIFE WHEN WE BECOME INURED TO GRIEF AND DARE NOT BE REBELLIOUS AGAINST THE INEXORABLE DOOM KNOWING WHO IT IS THAT DECREES
I USED TO FANCY YOU WOULD FORGET ME WHILE I WAS AWAY AT AUNT SHAW'S AND CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP AT NIGHTS WITH THAT NOTION IN MY HEAD AND I USED TO THINK HOW WILL MARGARET BEAR OUR MAKESHIFT POVERTY AFTER THE THOROUGH COMFORT AND LUXURY IN HARLEY STREET TILL I HAVE MANY A TIME BEEN MORE ASHAMED OF YOUR SEEING OUR CONTRIVANCES AT HELSTONE THAN OF ANY STRANGER FINDING THEM OUT OH MAMMA
HE WAS RATHER DISORDERLY TO BE SURE WITH A BLACK UNSHAVEN BEARD OF SEVERAL DAYS GROWTH MAKING HIS PALE FACE LOOK YET PALER AND A JACKET WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE BETTER FOR PATCHING
SOME WERE MEN GAUNT AS WOLVES AND MAD FOR PREY
BUT A MAN MUN SPEAK OUT FOR THE TRUTH AND WHEN I SEE THE WORLD GOING ALL WRONG AT THIS TIME O DAY BOTHERING ITSELF WI THINGS IT KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT AND LEAVING UNDONE ALL THE THINGS THAT LIE IN DISORDER CLOSE AT ITS HAND--WHY I SAY LEAVE A THIS TALK ABOUT RELIGION ALONE AND SET TO WORK ON WHAT YO SEE AND KNOW
BUT SHE WAS SO KIND AND THOUGHTFUL THAT MARGARET FELT SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED
LITTLE UNS TELLED ME SO
HE ONLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF HER
PERHAPS NOT IN SUCH A LARGE ROOM NOR WITH SO MANY PEOPLE
HER BOW WAS STIFFLY RETURNED
I HAVE MONEY IN BARBOUR'S HANDS
IT'S NO MATTER TO THEM HOW FAR THEIR AUTHORITIES HAVE TYRANNISED,--GALLED HASTY TEMPERS TO MADNESS,--OR IF THAT CAN BE ANY EXCUSE AFTERWARDS IT IS NEVER ALLOWED FOR IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
A CORONER'S INQUEST
THEN MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT SHE HAD COME
AND I DON'T WANT HER TO GO TO TH MILL AND YET I DUNNO WHAT SHE'S FIT FOR SHE COULD NOT DO'--MARGARET GLANCED UNCONSCIOUSLY AT THE UNCLEANED CORNERS OF THE ROOM--'SHE COULD HARDLY UNDERTAKE A SERVANT'S PLACE COULD SHE
BUT HE NEVER WENT NEAR HER HIMSELF
HOO SPEAKS PLAIN OUT WHAT'S IN HER MIND
I'M NOT A LAD TO BE COWED BY A PROUD LOOK FROM A WOMAN OR TO CARE FOR HER MISUNDERSTANDING ME AND MY POSITION
DR DONALDSON WHEELED ONE TO HIM AND PLACED HIM IN IT
SHE IS NOT WELL THAT IS ALL
SHE WENT ON
EVERY ONE MUST DO SO
I MUST NOT FORGET THAT I'M NONE ASHAMED O MY NAME
I LIKE TO SEE YOU SHOWING A BIT OF A SPIRIT
THERE WILL BE NO INQUEST
BESIDES SHE WENT ON IT IS ONLY THAT I AM TIRED TO-NIGHT
AND WHAT WITH MY BEING A GREAT DEAL WITH ANNA JUST BEFORE HER MARRIAGE AND NOT BEING VERY STRONG MYSELF DIXON HAD MORE OF THE CHARGE OF HIM THAN SHE EVER HAD BEFORE
MR THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK AND SHE WENT ON LOOKING FOR SOME PAPER ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN DOWN THE PROPOSALS FOR SECURITY
MRS HALE RAISED HER HEAD
BUT I DO KNOW THAT YOU OF ALL MEN ARE NOT ONE TO BEAR A LIFE AMONG SUCH LABOURERS
IT IS NO PARTIALITY OF MINE I ASSURE YOU WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY THINK OF THE RIGHTNESS OR WRONGNESS IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON TO MY OWN DEEP KNOWLEDGE MY INNATE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS WRONG
NOT IN THE LEAST BECAUSE OF YOUR LABOUR AND CAPITAL POSITIONS WHATEVER THEY ARE BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN DEALING WITH A SET OF MEN OVER WHOM YOU HAVE WHETHER YOU REJECT THE USE OF IT OR NOT IMMENSE POWER JUST BECAUSE YOUR LIVES AND YOUR WELFARE ARE SO CONSTANTLY AND INTIMATELY INTERWOVEN
I'M GLAD YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ONE OR TWO VANITIES JUST BY WAY OF SPECIMENS OF THE OLD ADAM I'M GOING TO BE JUST THE SAME EDITH IF YOU AND MY AUNT COULD BUT FANCY SO
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE WHY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I DINED AT MY CLUB
BUT WHEN I THINK OF HER AND HEAR YOU TALK OF HER I HATE HER
BUT WHEN THE MAGISTRATE HAD COME HE WAS RAMBLING ABOUT BEING AT SEA AND MIXING UP NAMES OF CAPTAINS AND LIEUTENANTS IN AN INDISTINCT MANNER WITH THOSE OF HIS FELLOW PORTERS AT THE RAILWAY
MR THORNTON OF MARLBOROUGH STREET AYE
WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER REST ON A POINT ON WHICH SHE SHOULD NOW ALL HER LIFE BE RESTLESS UNLESS SHE COULD RESOLVE NOT TO THINK UPON IT
NOR DID I ASK HIM WHAT HIS PRECIOUS SITUATION WAS
MARGARET QUESTIONED HE WITH A NERVOUS MOTION OF HIS HANDS
ARE WE TO GO STRAIGHT TO MILTON
FOR THOUGH THE MORNING HAD BEEN OF AN INCALCULABLE LENGTH TO THEM AND THEY FELT AS IF IT OUGHT LONG AGO TO HAVE CLOSED IN FOR THE REPOSE OF DARKNESS IT WAS THE VERY BUSIEST TIME OF A LONDON AFTERNOON IN NOVEMBER WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE
AND BE A BIT TENDER IN TH WAY OF GIVING IT TOO OR TH POOR SICK FOOLS MAY SPIT IT OUT I THEIR FACES
ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO FOLLOW HIM QUICKLY AND FASTEN IT BEHIND HIM AND CLAMBER UP THE STAIRS AGAIN WITH A SICK HEART AND A DIZZY HEAD
WE THE OWNERS OF CAPITAL HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT WE WILL DO WITH IT A HUMAN RIGHT SAID MARGARET VERY LOW
THEY FOUND MARGARET WITH A LETTER OPEN BEFORE HER EAGERLY DISCUSSING ITS CONTENTS WITH HER FATHER
SHE SHUT THE DOOR AND WENT HALF-WAY INTO THE STUDY
YOU MAY BEAT ME TO DEATH--YOU WILL NEVER MOVE ME FROM WHAT I HAVE DETERMINED UPON--NOT YOU HE STOOD AMONGST THEM WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED IN PRECISELY THE SAME ATTITUDE AS HE HAD BEEN IN ON THE STEPS
HER PALE BLUE EYES LIGHTENED UP AS SHE TOOK THEM AND HER FATHER SPOKE FOR HER
YOU KNEW HIM FORMERLY DIDN'T YOU
WHO IS CAPTAIN LENNOX
AND IT HAD TAKEN HIM LONG SILENT YEARS TO COME EVEN TO A GLIMMERING OF WHAT HE MIGHT BE NOW TO-DAY HERE IN HIS OWN TOWN HIS OWN FACTORY AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE
CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY KIND AND BROTHERLY TO MARGARET
THE MORE IT RAINS AND BLOWS THE MORE CERTAIN WE ARE TO HAVE HIM
I SEE TH OUD TIGER SETTING ON HIM
I AM LEAVING OUT OUR COLLEGES JUST AS I GIVE MR THORNTON LEAVE TO OMIT HIS FACTORIES IN SPEAKING OF THE CHARMS OF MILTON
IT MAY HAVE GONE YELLOW WITH LYING BY IF YOU LIKE MAMMA
YOU NEVER WERE FOND OF SCHOOLS MARGARET OR YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN AND KNOWN BEFORE THIS HOW MUCH IS BEING DONE FOR EDUCATION IN MILTON NO SAID SHE WITH SUDDEN MEEKNESS
HE'S OUT O BOUNDS
BUT THAT WERE ENOUGH FOR ME
IF HE THOUGHT ABOUT HER AND HER SILKS AND SATINS AT ALL IT WAS TO COMPARE HER AND THEM WITH THE PALE SORROW HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM SITTING MOTIONLESS WITH BENT HEAD AND FOLDED HANDS IN A ROOM WHERE THE STILLNESS WAS SO GREAT THAT YOU MIGHT ALMOST FANCY THE RUSH IN YOUR STRAINING EARS WAS OCCASIONED BY THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD YET HOVERING ROUND THEIR BELOVED
SHE DID NOT SEE HIM
IS THIS MR HALE'S SAID HE IN A CLEAR FULL DELICATE VOICE
NO JUDICIAL INQUIRY I MEAN BETSY SAYS THAT WOOLMER SOME MAN SHE KNOWS WHO IS IN A GROCER'S SHOP OUT AT CRAMPTON CAN SWEAR THAT MISS HALE WAS AT THE STATION AT THAT HOUR WALKING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH A YOUNG MAN I DON'T SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THAT
AND THE DIFFICULTY OF KEEPING A PIANO IN GOOD TUNE A DIFFICULTY WHICH EDITH SEEMED TO CONSIDER AS ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE THAT COULD BEFALL HER IN HER MARRIED LIFE AND WHAT GOWNS SHE SHOULD WANT IN THE VISITS TO SCOTLAND WHICH WOULD IMMEDIATELY SUCCEED HER MARRIAGE
THE NEXT MORNING BROUGHT MARGARET A LETTER FROM EDITH
SHALL WE HAVE LUNCH BEFORE OR AFTER WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE HOUSES WE MARKED IN THE MILTON TIMES OH LET US GET OUR WORK DONE FIRST VERY WELL
AND I TELLED HER TO FETCH YO TO ME
AND MR LENNOX'S APPEARANCE TOOK THIS SHAPE ALTHOUGH SECRETLY SHE FELT COMPLIMENTED BY HIS THINKING IT WORTH WHILE TO CALL
BUT FOR TH CHILDER
AND HOW SHE WOULD NOT PUT ON HER NEW GOWN TO GO TO A STUPID DINNER AND GET IT ALL WET AND SPLASHED IN GOING TO THE CARRIAGE
THERE ARE NO MORE BEFORE THURSDAY NO
SHE TOUCHED THE SHAWLS GENTLY AS THEY HUNG AROUND HER AND TOOK A PLEASURE IN THEIR SOFT FEEL AND THEIR BRILLIANT COLOURS AND RATHER LIKED TO BE DRESSED IN SUCH SPLENDOUR--ENJOYING IT MUCH AS A CHILD WOULD DO WITH A QUIET PLEASED SMILE ON HER LIPS
I'M AFRAID SUCH A THUNDERY DAY WAS NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD FOR THE DOCTOR TO SEE HER
AND NOW SHE HAS A BRIGHT HEALTHY COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS JUST AS SHE USED TO HAVE WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER BUT PAPA SAID MARGARET WITH HESITATION DO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS THE FLUSH OF PAIN NONSENSE MARGARET
MR HALE SPOKE OF HIM AS ALWAYS THE SAME
STAY WE TURN UP THIS STREET THE STREET DID NOT LOOK AS IF IT COULD CONTAIN ANY HOUSE LARGE ENOUGH FOR MRS THORNTON'S HABITATION
MY LITTLE MARGARET SAID HE CARESSING HER
SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEIZE THE SALIENT AND CHARACTERISTIC POINTS OF A SCENE BUT SHE COULD ENUMERATE ENOUGH OF INDISCRIMINATE PARTICULARS FOR MARGARET TO MAKE IT OUT FOR HERSELF CAPTAIN LENNOX AND ANOTHER LATELY MARRIED OFFICER SHARED A VILLA HIGH UP ON THE BEAUTIFUL PRECIPITOUS ROCKS OVERHANGING THE SEA
STAND DOWN LAD AND SAY YO'R PRETTY HYMN TO MISS MARGARET
AND ABOUT HER OWN GREAT FAULT--HE WOULD BE DISTRESSED BEYOND MEASURE AT HER WANT OF COURAGE AND FAITH YET PERPETUALLY TROUBLED TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER
AND THEY'LL SOON FIND OUT THEY'D BETTER GIVE US OUR FIVE PER CENT THAN LOSE THE PROFIT THEY'LL GAIN
I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS
PERHAPS I USED TOO GENERAL AN EXPRESSION IN SAYING VERY APT BUT CERTAINLY THEIR LIVES ARE SUCH AS VERY OFTEN TO PRODUCE EITHER INORDINATE SELF-SUFFICIENCY OR A MORBID STATE OF CONSCIENCE REPLIED MR LENNOX WITH PERFECT COOLNESS
I AM OBLIGED TO YOU FOR WISHING TO SHOW HIM RESPECT BUT ABOUT FREDERICK
IT SEEMS STRANGE TO THINK THAT WHAT GIVES US MOST HOPE FOR THE FUTURE SHOULD BE CALLED DOLORES SAID MARGARET
SHE WAS UNWILLING TO SPEAK
I SHALL LOOK TO SEE YOU ON THE TWENTY-FIRST IF YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH THE MEDICINES AND TREATMENT WHICH DR DONALDSON HAD ORDERED FOR MRS HALE DID HER SO MUCH GOOD AT FIRST THAT NOT ONLY SHE HERSELF BUT MARGARET BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AND THAT SHE COULD RECOVER PERMANENTLY
I AM ALMOST CERTAIN YOU ARE MISTAKEN
YES JOHN IT'S NO USE HIDING UP YOUR ACHING HEART FROM ME
FAIS CE QUE DOIS ADVIENNE QUE POURRA HITHERTO SHE HAD NOT STIRRED FROM WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER
A COMPLETE PLAN EMERGES LIKE A PIECE OF MACHINERY APPARENTLY FITTED FOR EVERY EMERGENCY
SO MUCH WAS UNDERSTOOD THROUGH EYES THAT COULD NOT BE PUT INTO WORDS
WELL AT ANY RATE I REVOKE WHAT I SAID THIS MORNING--THAT YOU MILTON PEOPLE DID NOT REVERENCE THE PAST
THAT WOULD BE WORSE THAN ALL
MY MOTHER'S QUITE WELL THANK YOU
IT IS MOST UNFORTUNATE
THERE SHE STOOD VERY PALE AND QUIET WITH HER LARGE GRAVE EYES OBSERVING EVERYTHING,--UP TO EVERY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER SMALL
WHAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT
I DID NOT THINK I HAD BEEN SO OLD SAID MARGARET AFTER A PAUSE OF SILENCE
HE IS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM MARGARET DROPPED HER SEWING
ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MR HALE
WELL THEN TELL ME THAT WHICH I SHOULD LIKE STILL BETTER TO KNOW WHAT THE PARSONAGE IS LIKE OH I CAN'T DESCRIBE MY HOME
OR WOULD YO RAYTHER HAVE ME BOUT MY BRAINS BOUT YOUR BRAINS IF YOU USE THEM FOR MEDDLING WITH MY BUSINESS
THE ABSURD WAY IN WHICH HE HAD GONE AND DONE THE VERY THING HE HAD SO OFTEN AGREED WITH HIMSELF IN THINKING WOULD BE THE MOST FOOLISH THING IN THE WORLD
HE CAME UP ABOUT THIS SUB-LETTING THE PROPERTY--MARLBOROUGH MILLS AND THE HOUSE AND PREMISES ADJOINING I MEAN
HAVE COMPASSION ON MY INFIRMITIES FOR HIS SAKE I WILL WALK SLOWER FOR YOUR OWN SAKE
AND HE ALMOST LONGED TO ASK HER TO DO FOR HIM WHAT HE SAW HER COMPELLED TO DO FOR HER FATHER WHO TOOK HER LITTLE FINGER AND THUMB IN HIS MASCULINE HAND AND MADE THEM SERVE AS SUGAR-TONGS
WE HAD PLENTY OF OUR OWN--TREES LOADED WITH THEM
MARGARET WAS A LITTLE DROOPING A LITTLE FLUSHED AS SHE REPLIED
HE MUST CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS MASTER OVER HIS OWN ANGER BY BEING PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO ALLOW HIGGINS ACCESS TO HIM WHENEVER THE STRICT RULES OF BUSINESS OR MR THORNTON'S LEISURE PERMITTED
I WILL RETURN STRAIGHT HERE AFTER I HAVE DONE MY BUSINESS
BECAUSE I SUPPOSE THEY MIGHT HAVE CONSCIENCES THAT TOLD THEM HOW SURELY THEY WERE MAKING THE OLD MOTHER INTO AN ADVOCATE FOR THEM IN CASE THEY HAD ANY PLANS ON THE SON'S HEART SHE SMILED A GRIM SMILE FOR SHE HAD BEEN PLEASED BY MARGARET'S FRANKNESS
MAYBE TEN AT THE OUTSIDE
IN SPITE OF HER ALARM WHICH WAS EVEN GREATER THAN THE OCCASION WARRANTED SHE OBEYED ALL DIXON'S DIRECTIONS PROMPTLY AND WELL WITHOUT A WORD OF SELF-JUSTIFICATION
SHE HEARD HIM LINGER AS IF AWAITING HER OR SOME SIGN OF HER
BUT I HALF EXPECTED TO SEE YOU GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM OH PAPA
BUT NOW SHE HAD LEISURE TO TAKE THEM OUT AND MOURN OVER THEM AND STUDY THEIR NATURE AND SEEK THE TRUE METHOD OF SUBDUING THEM INTO THE ELEMENTS OF PEACE
I AX YOUR PARDON IF I USE WRONG WORDS
I HOPED THE WHOLE THING WAS BUT AN IMAGINATION
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK ME IMPERTINENT WHEN I SAY THAT I MAY HAVE TO CALL ON YOU AGAIN
BUT AFTER THE FIRST COLD DISTANT BOW HE NEVER SEEMED TO LET HIS EYES FALL ON HER AGAIN
THEY RUNG IN HIS EARS
HE WAS THINKING I WILL NOT BE DAUNTED FROM DOING AS I CHOOSE BY THE THOUGHT OF HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE PLACE YOU WILL BE LIVING IN WHEN NINETY-SIX HARLEY STREET WILL BE LOOKING DINGY AND DIRTY AND DULL AND SHUT UP
AT LAST SHE SAID AND THE FURNITURE--HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE TO MANAGE THE REMOVAL
MR THORNTON'S HEART BEAT QUICK AND STRONG AND FOR THE TIME HE UTTERLY FORGOT THE OUTWOOD LANE
TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
WARRANTS ARE OUT AGAINST THREE MEN FOR CONSPIRACY MOTHER
IF YOU WOULD SAY THE OLD GOOD WORDS IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL SOMETHING OF THE PIOUS SIMPLICITY OF MY CHILDHOOD
REMEMBER WE ARE OF A DIFFERENT RACE FROM THE GREEKS TO WHOM BEAUTY WAS EVERYTHING AND TO WHOM MR BELL MIGHT SPEAK OF A LIFE OF LEISURE AND SERENE ENJOYMENT MUCH OF WHICH ENTERED IN THROUGH THEIR OUTWARD SENSES
IT WAS A PICTURE BEFORE HIS EYES WHEREVER HE WENT AND WHATEVER HE WAS DOING
NICHOLAS SAW HER COME IN AND GREETED HER WITH A GRUFF BUT NOT UNFRIENDLY NOD
IT FLATTERED HER MUCH AS LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH WAS FLATTERED BY HIS COURTIERS SHADING THEIR EYES FROM THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF HIS PRESENCE
HE WENT INTO THE FIELDS WALKING BRISKLY BECAUSE THE SHARP MOTION RELIEVED HIS MIND
I CAN'T SEND A BELLMAN ABOUT TO CRY ALOUD AND PROCLAIM IN THE STREETS WHAT YOU ARE PLEASED TO CALL MY HEROISM
I RECKON THEY PAY YO FOR TEACHING THEM DUNNOT THEY YES REPLIED MR HALE SMILING
JUST AS WE DID A CORRECT SUM AT SCHOOL ON THE SLATE WHERE AN INCORRECT ONE WAS ONLY HALF RUBBED OUT
EVER SINCE LADY BERESFORD'S MAID FIRST TOOK ME IN TO SEE HER DRESSED OUT IN WHITE CRAPE AND CORN-EARS AND SCARLET POPPIES AND I RAN A NEEDLE DOWN INTO MY FINGER AND BROKE IT IN AND SHE TORE UP HER WORKED POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF AFTER THEY'D CUT IT OUT AND CAME IN TO WET THE BANDAGES AGAIN WITH LOTION WHEN SHE RETURNED FROM THE BALL--WHERE SHE'D BEEN THE PRETTIEST YOUNG LADY OF ALL--I'VE NEVER LOVED ANY ONE LIKE HER
NAY MORE HE WROTE A SPECIAL LETTER COMMANDING HER TO COME
MARGARET WAS DISAPPOINTED AND THE POOR WOMAN SAW IT AND BEGAN TO MAKE A KIND OF APOLOGY
MY UTMOST EXPECTATION ONLY GOES SO FAR AS THIS--THAT THEY MAY RENDER STRIKES NOT THE BITTER VENOMOUS SOURCES OF HATRED THEY HAVE HITHERTO BEEN
FOUR MONTHS AGO ALL THE DECISIONS SHE NEEDED TO MAKE WERE WHAT DRESS SHE WOULD WEAR FOR DINNER AND TO HELP EDITH TO DRAW OUT THE LISTS OF WHO SHOULD TAKE DOWN WHOM IN THE DINNER PARTIES AT HOME
WHERE I HAVE DONE WRONG SHE DOES NOT ACCUSE ME--SHE DOES NOT KNOW
SHE WAS RESTLESS THOUGH SO WEAK
GOOD GIRL SAID HE
EDITH NEVER NAMED THAT
BUT THE YOUNG MAN WAS HALF-EDUCATED AS REGARDED INFORMATION AND WHOLLY UNEDUCATED AS REGARDED ANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITY THAN THAT OF GETTING MONEY AND BRUTALISED BOTH AS TO HIS PLEASURES AND HIS PAINS
HER DAUGHTER LEFT HER AFTER DINNER SITTING IN HER EASY CHAIR WITH HER HAND LYING IN HER HUSBAND'S WHO LOOKED MORE WORN AND SUFFERING THAN SHE BY FAR
BUT REMEMBER IN A WEEK OR A FORTNIGHT I MAY BE DEAD AND BURIED I'LL COME AS SOON AS I CAN BESSY SAID MARGARET SQUEEZING HER HAND TIGHT
HE WOULD NOT SPEAK
IF MY SON'S WORK-PEOPLE STRIKE I WILL ONLY SAY THEY ARE A PACK OF UNGRATEFUL HOUNDS
BUT THIS WISH WAS VAIN LIKE SO MANY OTHERS
I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
HE TOLD ME HE LIVED IN MARLBOROUGH STREET I'M SURE SAID MR HALE WITH A MUCH PERPLEXED AIR
MAPPEN TENDERER
FOR BELIE ME I'SE NE'ER GOT A STROKE O WORK NOR YET A SIGHT OF ANY
A LITTLE BREEZE WAS STIRRING IN THE HOT AIR AND THOUGH THERE WERE NO TREES TO SHOW THE PLAYFUL TOSSING MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE WIND AMONG THE LEAVES MARGARET KNEW HOW SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER BY WAY-SIDE IN COPSES OR IN THICK GREEN WOODS THERE WAS A PLEASANT MURMURING DANCING SOUND,--A RUSHING AND FALLING NOISE THE VERY THOUGHT OF WHICH WAS AN ECHO OF DISTANT GLADNESS IN HER HEART
MAN OF ACTION AS HE WAS BUSY IN THE WORLD'S GREAT BATTLE THERE WAS A DEEPER RELIGION BINDING HIM TO GOD IN HIS HEART IN SPITE OF HIS STRONG WILFULNESS THROUGH ALL HIS MISTAKES THAN MR HALE HAD EVER DREAMED
BUT I'D LIEFER SWEEP TH STREETS IF PAUPERS HAD NA GOT HOLD ON THAT WORK
WHY SHE MIGHT BE A DUKE'S DAUGHTER TO HEAR YOU SPEAK
THE ASPECT OF PITEOUS DISTRESS ON HIS FACE ALMOST AS IMPLORING A MERCIFUL AND KIND JUDGMENT FROM HIS CHILD GAVE HER A SUDDEN SICKENING
MOTHER HE MADE A STEP FORWARDS
I'VE NO WISH TO HEAR WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY I'M SURE
DON'T COME
MR THORNTON IS MY SON
I HAVE ALWAYS DESIRED TO ACT THE PART OF A FRIEND TO YOU
MARGARET WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WHEN SHE FOUND HER FATHER AND HIGGINS IN EARNEST CONVERSATION--EACH SPEAKING WITH GENTLE POLITENESS TO THE OTHER HOWEVER THEIR OPINIONS MIGHT CLASH
THEY ARE MUCH AS IS TO BE EXPECTED
SHE WAS QUITE IN THE DARK AS TO HIS PLANS AND HER FATHER WAS MISERABLE AT ALL THIS UNCERTAINTY
IT IS A LITTLE SAD FOR YOU TO BE LEFT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT JUST AT THIS TIME WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS SO GAY
GIVE ME YOUR HAND
BUT YOU'VE RECKONED ON HAVING BUTCHER'S MEAT ONCE A DAY IF YOU'RE IN WORK
HE WAITED FOR THAT LOOK TO GO OFF,--FOR HER GASPING BREATH TO COME
ASKED MR THORNTON OF HIMSELF WITH A STRANGE KIND OF DISPLEASURE THAT PREVENTED HIM FOR THE MOMENT FROM REPLYING TO HER
IT SEEMED AS IF DESSERTS WERE IMPROMPTU AND UNUSUAL THINGS AT THE PARSONAGE
HE WENT UPSTAIRS TWO STEPS AT A TIME AND ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE DIXON COULD ANNOUNCE HIM,--HIS FACE FLUSHED HIS EYES SHINING WITH KINDLY EARNESTNESS
MRS THORNTON WAS TOO CONSCIENTIOUS TO PROMISE WHAT SHE DID NOT MEAN TO PERFORM
HE IS MY ADVISER IN THIS I AM SORRY THAT I CAME IF IT TROUBLES YOU
ONLY REMEMBER WHEN I COME AGAIN I COME AS A FRIEND
BUT IT IS STILL FINER TO DEFY ARBITRARY POWER UNJUSTLY AND CRUELLY USED-NOT ON BEHALF OF OURSELVES BUT ON BEHALF OF OTHERS MORE HELPLESS FOR ALL THAT I WISH I COULD SEE FREDERICK ONCE MORE--JUST ONCE
HOW WHITE SHE LOOKS
THE CURVING LINES OF THE RED LIPS JUST PARTED IN THE INTEREST OF LISTENING TO WHAT HER COMPANION SAID--THE HEAD A LITTLE BENT FORWARDS SO AS TO MAKE A LONG SWEEPING LINE FROM THE SUMMIT WHERE THE LIGHT CAUGHT ON THE GLOSSY RAVEN HAIR TO THE SMOOTH IVORY TIP OF THE SHOULDER
I SAW HIM LOOK AT ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS AT FIRST THE SUN WAS SO IN MY EYES BUT IN AN INSTANT THE DAZZLE WENT OFF AND I SAW IT WAS MR THORNTON AND WE BOWED AND HE SAW FREDERICK OF COURSE SAID MR BELL HELPING HER ON WITH HER STORY AS HE THOUGHT
I SHOULD ALWAYS FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE CHILDREN IF I HAD MARGARET SETTLED DOWN NEAR ME
IT DID THEM NO HARM
AND THIS CONSCIOUSNESS HURT HIS PRIDE HE HAD ALWAYS PIQUED HIMSELF ON HIS SELF-CONTROL AND CONTROL HIMSELF HE WOULD
AND YOUR PAPA IS IN SUCH LOW SPIRITS THIS MORNING ABOUT SOMETHING--I DON'T KNOW WHAT
BUT HE HAD STEELED HIMSELF
SHE DOES NOT CARE FOR ME AND THAT IS ENOUGH,--TOO MUCH
THERE HAD BEEN ROUGH-STONING DONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR WHILE THE FLAGS UNDER THE CHAIRS AND TABLE AND ROUND THE WALLS RETAINED THEIR DARK UNWASHED APPEARANCE
WELL PERHAPS NOT--I FORGET
AND SO SHE SHUDDERED AWAY FROM THE THREAT OF HIS ENDURING LOVE
SHE QUITE SMILED AS SHE SAW ME STANDING BY HER
THE VERY PARTS WHICH MADE MARGARET GLOW AS SHE LISTENED EDITH PRETENDED TO SHIVER AND SHUDDER AT
AND OF COURSE HE MUST LOSE BY THIS TURN-OUT
WHY ARE YOU GOING ROUND BY CRAMPTON TO ASK AFTER MISS HALE I WILL SEND
I LIKE TO TAKE THIS FRUIT TO THE POOR MOTHER AND IT IS SIMPLY RIGHT THAT I SHOULD
I THINK IT'S AS WELL I SHOULD NOT GO MARGARET WAS AFRAID OF LETTING HER MIND RUN TOO MUCH UPON THIS SPANISH PLAN
AND RATHER TO HER SURPRISE SHE FOUND FROM THE TONE OF HIS INDEED THAT MR THORNTON OF MILTON WAS NOT SUCH AN UNKNOWN NAME TO HIM AS SHE HAD IMAGINED IT WOULD BE
HER FATHER SAID YOU DISLIKE IT VERY MUCH DON'T YOU MARGARET THEN SHE CONQUERED HERSELF AND SAID WITH A BRIGHT STRONG LOOK ON HER FACE
HE TREMBLED PITIFULLY AS THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN WAS ARRANGING HIS CRAPE DRAPERIES AROUND HIM
BUT WHEN WE SPEAK OF HIM AS A MAN WE CONSIDER HIM NOT MERELY WITH REGARD TO HIS FELLOW-MEN BUT IN RELATION TO HIMSELF,--TO LIFE--TO TIME--TO ETERNITY
AY CLEMMING
FREDERICK SAID MR BELL IN SURPRISE
I HOPE EDITH WILL RECEIVE HIM PROPERLY
THOU ART GONE HOME MRS
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT THE MONEY TO BRING ANY GREAT LONDON SURGEON DOWN AND I AM SURE DR DONALDSON IS ONLY SECOND IN SKILL TO THE VERY BEST,--IF INDEED HE IS TO THEM FREDERICK BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IMPATIENTLY
NOTHING WANTING THE GENTLEMEN CAME DROPPING IN ONE BY ONE AND THE BUZZ AND NOISE DEEPENED IN TONE
HE CAME TO HER AND TOUCHED HER SHOULDER BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS THERE
NICHOLAS HIGGINS HAD GONE OUT IN THE MORNING LEAVING BESSY AS WELL AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
MARGARET WAS GLAD OF THIS FOR SHE SAW THAT HIGGINS WAS BETTER LEFT TO HIMSELF
LONDON AND THE ALHAMBRA ARE THE TWO PLACES I LONG TO SEE LONDON AND THE ALHAMBRA YES
WHAT MY REASON IS I REFUSE TO TELL
FOR I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER RELATION TO SUMMON I HOPE I MAY BE ALLOWED TO GO CERTAINLY
AND TO A RICH GENTLEMAN TOO ONLY HE'S A DEAL OLDER THAN SHE IS
THEY'RE MIGHTY ANXIOUS TO COME ROUND US WI THAT PIECE O WISDOM
AND--HIS PRESENCE ALWAYS A CERTAIN KIND OF PLEASURE TO MR HALE AS HIS POWER AND DECISION MADE HIM AND HIS OPINIONS A SAFE SURE PORT--WAS UNUSUALLY AGREEABLE TO HER FATHER AS MARGARET SAW
MR THORNTON WATCHED THE REPLACING OF THIS TROUBLESOME ORNAMENT WITH FAR MORE ATTENTION THAN HE LISTENED TO HER FATHER
HER PLANS FOR FREDERICK HAD ALL FAILED AND THE TEMPTATION LAY THERE A DEAD MOCKERY,--A MOCKERY WHICH HAD NEVER HAD LIFE IN IT
AND YET DAY BY DAY HAD OF ITSELF AND BY ITSELF BEEN VERY ENDURABLE--SMALL KEEN BRIGHT LITTLE SPOTS OF POSITIVE ENJOYMENT HAVING COME SPARKLING INTO THE VERY MIDDLE OF SORROWS
MARGARET AND HER FATHER WALKED HOME
THE STREETS ARE NOT VERY QUIET YET MARGARET'S THOUGHTS WERE QUITE ALIVE ENOUGH TO THE PRESENT TO MAKE HER DESIROUS OF GETTING RID OF BOTH MR LOWE AND THE CAB BEFORE SHE REACHED CRAMPTON CRESCENT FOR FEAR OF ALARMING HER FATHER AND MOTHER
THE LENGTHENING LIGHT HAD DECEIVED HER AS TO THE LATENESS OF THE EVENING
KEEN-SIGHTED FAR-SEEING INTELLIGENT SARCASTIC AND PROUD
IT HAD ENDED WELL
I RECKON YO'RE RIGHT
BUT NOW AMONG HIS FELLOWS THERE WAS NO UNCERTAINTY AS TO HIS POSITION
THEM THAT IS OF A TRADE MUN HANG TOGETHER
MR THORNTON REMAINED IN THE DINING-ROOM TRYING TO THINK OF THE BUSINESS HE HAD TO DO AT THE POLICE-OFFICE AND IN REALITY THINKING OF MARGARET
MARGARET WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE WANT UNDER WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING UNKNOWN TO HIMSELF
THE GATES WON'T BEAR SUCH ANOTHER SHOCK
ONLY YO SEE AND NOW HER VOICE TOOK A MOURNFUL PLEADING TONE AT TIMES O STRIKE THERE'S MUCH TO KNOCK A MAN DOWN FOR ALL THEY START SO HOPEFULLY
HIS DRINKING TEA WITH HER FATHER WHO WOULD BE TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR HIS VISITOR--HER MOTHER SO ILL--SEEMED UTTERLY OUT OF THE QUESTION
I DON'T KNOW THAT HE GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
I FEEL MORE AS IF IT WAS THE EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES I WISH I KNEW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO WEAR SAID MRS HALE NERVOUSLY
IN A MINUTE HE CAME UP QUITE CHEERFULLY TO HIS MOTHER AND PUTTING ONE HAND LIGHTLY ON HER SHOULDER SAID
MANY THINGS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM WHICH WOULD BE VERY DISAGREEABLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE ARE YOU NOT A MILTON MAN YOURSELF ASKED MARGARET
MRS THORNTON SIGHED I WILL BE A TRUE FRIEND IF CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT
YOU DO SEE HER LYING THERE
HE TRIED TO TALK TO MR HALE
I WAS NOT THERE SAID SHE SLOWLY AND HEAVILY
THERE IS THE CHURCH AND A FEW HOUSES NEAR IT ON THE GREEN--COTTAGES RATHER--WITH ROSES GROWING ALL OVER THEM AND FLOWERING ALL THE YEAR ROUND ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS--MAKE YOUR PICTURE COMPLETE SAID HE
I'M EASIER IN MY MIND FOR HAVING SPIT IT OUT
SHE STOOD BY HER FATHER HOLDING ON TO THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR
WHEN HER FATHER HAD DRIVEN OFF ON HIS WAY TO THE RAILROAD MARGARET FELT HOW GREAT AND LONG HAD BEEN THE PRESSURE ON HER TIME AND HER SPIRITS
MOTHER I HAVE DECIDED
I REALLY DIDN'T SEE YOU
AND THEN ROUSING HERSELF SHE SAID HE IS A TALL BROAD-SHOULDERED MAN ABOUT--HOW OLD PAPA I SHOULD GUESS ABOUT THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY--WITH A FACE THAT IS NEITHER EXACTLY PLAIN NOR YET HANDSOME NOTHING REMARKABLE--NOT QUITE A GENTLEMAN
AND AS IT AFFECTED HIS BRANCH OF THE TRADE HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT AND DROVE HARD BARGAINS
DELIGHTED WITH MARGARET'S IDEA OF GOING OUT SKETCHING TOGETHER
SHE LOOKED FORWARD WITH LONGING THOUGH UNSPOKEN INTEREST TO THE HOMELY OBJECT OF DIXON'S RETURN FROM MILTON
MY FACE MUST BE VERY EXPRESSIVE REPLIED MARGARET
BLESS YO'R SWEET PITIFUL FACE
SHE SAW THE ACCUSTOMED ROOM THE FIGURE OF DIXON IN SHADOW AS THE LATTER STOOD HOLDING THE CANDLE A LITTLE BEHIND HER FOR FEAR OF THE EFFECT ON MISS HALE'S STARTLED EYES SWOLLEN AND BLINDED AS THEY WERE
HIS EYES WERE GENERALLY MERRY-LOOKING BUT AT TIMES THEY AND HIS MOUTH SO SUDDENLY CHANGED AND GAVE HER SUCH AN IDEA OF LATENT PASSION THAT IT ALMOST MADE HER AFRAID
THEY HAD ALL ALONG WISHED HER TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY WITH THEIR CHARACTERS THEY MADE BUT LAZY EFFORTS TO FORWARD HER OWN SEPARATE WISH
HER MOTHER CAUGHT A SEVERE COLD AND DIXON HERSELF WAS EVIDENTLY NOT WELL ALTHOUGH MARGARET COULD NOT INSULT HER MORE THAN BY TRYING TO SAVE HER OR BY TAKING ANY CARE OF HER
EVEN A DINNER-PARTY
AND SOMEHOW THIS VISIT TO HELSTONE HAD NOT BEEN ALL--HAD NOT BEEN EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED
SHE KNEW MORE THAN HE DID AND YET SHE LISTENED WITH THAT HOPELESS EXPRESSION OF AWED APPREHENSION
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT NEVER SAID MR HALE DECIDEDLY
MARGARET HAD TAKEN OFF HER GOWN AND TOSSED IT ASIDE WITH A SORT OF IMPATIENT DISGUST AND PUT ON HER DRESSING-GOWN
HE WOULD SAVE MARGARET
JUST WHEN MY PARTY WAS MADE UP SO BEAUTIFULLY--FITTED IN SO PRECISELY FOR MR COLTHURST--THERE HAS HENRY COME WITH AN APOLOGY IT IS TRUE AND MAKING USE OF YOUR NAME FOR AN EXCUSE AND ASKED ME IF HE MAY BRING THAT MR THORNTON OF MILTON--YOUR TENANT YOU KNOW--WHO IS IN LONDON ABOUT SOME LAW BUSINESS
IT LOOKED MORE PEACEFUL THAN LIFE
ALTOGETHER A MAN WHO SEEMS MADE FOR HIS NICHE MAMMA
MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
BUT NOT THE MOTIVES THAT ELEVATE IT OUT OF A CRIME INTO AN HEROIC PROTECTION OF THE WEAK
HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHO SHE WAS AS HE CAUGHT THE SIMPLE STRAIGHT UNABASHED LOOK WHICH SHOWED THAT HIS BEING THERE WAS OF NO CONCERN TO THE BEAUTIFUL COUNTENANCE AND CALLED UP NO FLUSH OF SURPRISE TO THE PALE IVORY OF THE COMPLEXION
IT'S A WITHSTANDING OF INJUSTICE PAST PRESENT OR TO COME
ONLY I FRETTED AGAIN IT AND THEY DIDN'T BUT WHAT WAS IT
WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER FOR THE DAY IT WAS YET EARLY IN THE SUMMER AFTERNOON
SHE HAD COME BECAUSE HER SON ASKED IT FROM HER AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR BUT WITH ALL THE PROUD BITTER FEELINGS OF HER NATURE IN ARMS AGAINST THAT FAMILY OF WHICH MARGARET FORMED ONE
AND NOW HE'S DEAD WELL IF THOU WUNNOT THOU WUNNOT
THEN THE BILLS BECAME DUE FOR THE COTTON HE HAD PURCHASED
I'M UPWARDS OF SIXTY AND FEEL NO LOSS OF STRENGTH EITHER BODILY OR MENTAL
LITTLE BITS AS FLY OFF FRO THE COTTON WHEN THEY'RE CARDING IT AND FILL THE AIR TILL IT LOOKS ALL FINE WHITE DUST
LET ME FIND ONE SAID MARGARET IN THE MIDST OF HER TEARS
BUT THE INSPECTOR THOUGH A VERY KEEN WAS NOT A VERY DEEP OBSERVER
WHEN PRAYERS WERE ENDED AND HIS MOTHER HAD WISHED HIM GOODNIGHT WITH THAT LONG STEADY LOOK OF HERS WHICH CONVEYED NO EXPRESSION OF THE TENDERNESS THAT WAS IN HER HEART BUT YET HAD THE INTENSITY OF A BLESSING MR THORNTON CONTINUED HIS WALK
MR HALE GROANED
HE COULD NOT PREVENT HER DOING THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE DID NOT LIKE MARGARET'S TRICK OF CALLING HER DEAR OLD DIXON WHENEVER SHE WAS PARTICULARLY DEMONSTRATIVE
PERHAPS YOU KNOW MY BROTHER HAS IMPORTED HANDS FROM IRELAND AND IT HAS IRRITATED THE MILTON PEOPLE EXCESSIVELY--AS IF HE HADN'T A RIGHT TO GET LABOUR WHERE HE COULD
NEVER FEAR
SHE TALKED ON PLANNING VILLAGE KINDNESSES UNHEEDING THE SILENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE MONOSYLLABIC ANSWERS OF MARGARET
YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY MAMMA YESTERDAY
THE NEXT THING WILL BE--INDEED WE'RE ALL BUT COME TO IT NOW--THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO GO AND ASK--STAND HAT IN HAND--AND HUMBLY ASK THE SECRETARY OF THE SPINNER UNION TO BE SO KIND AS TO FURNISH US WITH LABOUR AT THEIR OWN PRICE
BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
HE HAD KNOWN WHAT LOVE WAS--A SHARP PANG A FIERCE EXPERIENCE IN THE MIDST OF WHOSE FLAMES HE WAS STRUGGLING
THE EYELIDS WERE LARGE AND ARCHED GIVING TO THE EYES A PECULIAR LANGUID BEAUTY WHICH WAS ALMOST FEMININE
IT SEEMED AS IF ANY DAY NOW MIGHT GIVE HIM THE CERTAINTY WITHOUT HAVING WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED NEVER TO OFFER TO HER AGAIN
BUT I BELIEVE I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHARMS OF A DRESS AND THE CHARMS OF A WOMAN
MARGARET AND FREDERICK LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
WHY DON'T YOU KNOW
OF WHAT EACH ONE SHOULD BE HE SEES THE FORM AND RULE AND TILL HE REACH TO THAT HIS JOY CAN NE'ER BE FULL RUCKERT
BUT MR THORNTON YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND TO MY FATHER SAID SHE CHANGING HER WHOLE TONE AND BEARING TO A MOST WOMANLY SOFTNESS
AND BESIDES I CAN'T SPARE MARGARET NO
HER ONLY PLEASURE NOW IN DECKING HERSELF OUT WAS IN THINKING THAT HER MOTHER WOULD TAKE DELIGHT IN SEEING HER DRESSED
BUT THORNTON HAVING GOT HIS OWN PURPOSE DIDN'T CARE TO GO ON WI THE PROSECUTION FOR THE RIOT
IT'S NO GOOD EXPECTING MARCY AT THE HANDS O THEM MEASTERS
BESIDES HE MAY BE BETTER AND WANT SOME CARE
IT WAS RATHER RISING THE MORE AS HIS SENSE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER WAS PASSING AWAY
THE HANDS HAVE BEEN UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO TURN OUT AS PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD
I A'MOST THINK THEY BEAT MY OWN WENCHES FOR SHARPNESS THOUGH MAPPEN IT'S WRONG TO SAY SO AND ONE ON EM IN HER GRAVE
BUT THIS IS TERRIBLE
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
BUT ALIVE
TH UNION'S THE PLOUGH MAKING READY THE LAND FOR HARVEST-TIME
I DO NOT WANT TO VEX YOU
IF THE WHEAT IS WELL GOT IN WE SHALL HAVE A BRISK TRADE NEXT YEAR WHATEVER YOU DOCTORS HAVE AY AY
HE NEVER LOOKED AT HER
HE NEVER LOOKED AT HER
KEEP UP YOUR NAME--TRY ALL RISKS FOR THAT
BUT THOUGH REASONING HERSELF INTO THE BELIEF THAT IN THIS HERS WAS NO UNCOMMON LOT HER HEART DID NOT ACHE THE LESS WITH LONGING THAT SOME TIME--YEARS AND YEARS HENCE--BEFORE HE DIED AT ANY RATE HE MIGHT KNOW HOW MUCH SHE HAD BEEN TEMPTED
DIXON SOBBED ALOUD
CAN'T MRS LENNOX COME TO HER
AND ABOVE ALL THERE WAS TO BE NO GOING AGAIN THE LAW OF THE LAND
I AM SURE YOU ARE TIRED IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT MUCH THIS WET RELAXING DAY
SHE WONDERED HOW HER FATHER AND MOTHER COULD BE SO FORGETFUL SO REGARDLESS OF THEIR COMPANION THROUGH THE DAY AS NEVER TO MENTION HIS NAME
HE WOULD BE TOO DELICATE TO RUN THE CHANCE OF MEETING HER WHILE HER SHAME MUST BE SO FRESH IN HIS MEMORY
BY-AND-BY THEY'LL FIND OUT TYRANTS MAKES LIARS THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE
I SHOULD THINK HE WERE GOING TO DIE IF HE SPOKE ME CIVIL
BUT MARGARET SAW THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO BE ASKED FOR THE EXPLANATION
YOU CANNOT MEAN THAT YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LEAVE THE CHURCH--TO GIVE UP HELSTONE--TO BE FOR EVER SEPARATE FROM ME FROM MAMMA--LED AWAY BY SOME DELUSION--SOME TEMPTATION
THAT ENCOURAGED MARGARET TO SPEAK
CHAPTER XXVIII COMFORT IN SORROW THROUGH CROSS TO CROWN!--AND THOUGH THY SPIRIT'S LIFE TRIALS UNTOLD ASSAIL WITH GIANT STRENGTH GOOD CHEER
SHOLTO WILL GO TO OXFORD ON WEDNESDAY AND YOU MUST SEND WORD BY MR BELL TO HIM WHEN WE'RE TO EXPECT YOU
THE ROBIN HAD GONE AWAY INTO THE VAST STILLNESS OF NIGHT
IT IS ONLY WITH BEING HERE WHEN I DO SO WANT TO GO
HER AUNT WAS SO MUCH ABSORBED IN ASKING MR HENRY LENNOX--WHO HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME TO DINNER--ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BROTHER THE BRIDEGROOM HIS SISTER THE BRIDESMAID COMING WITH THE CAPTAIN FROM SCOTLAND FOR THE OCCASION AND VARIOUS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LENNOX FAMILY THAT MARGARET SAW SHE WAS NO MORE WANTED AS SHAWL-BEARER AND DEVOTED HERSELF TO THE AMUSEMENT OF THE OTHER VISITORS WHOM HER AUNT HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN
IF YO CARE YO MAY COME
HALES--FATHER AND DAUGHTER COME,--MOTHER TOO GREAT AN INVALID--MACPHERSONS COME AND MR HORSFALL AND MR YOUNG
BUT IN MILTON EVERY ONE WAS TOO BUSY FOR QUIET SPEECH OR ANY RIPENED INTERCOURSE OF THOUGHT
THEY LABOUR ON FROM DAY TO DAY IN THE GREAT SOLITUDE OF STEAMING FIELDS--NEVER SPEAKING OR LIFTING UP THEIR POOR BENT DOWNCAST HEADS
COME GIVE ME A KISS AND RUN OFF TO BED BUT SHE HEARD HIM PACING ABOUT RACOONING AS SHE AND EDITH USED TO CALL IT LONG AFTER HER SLOW AND LANGUID UNDRESSING WAS FINISHED--LONG AFTER SHE BEGAN TO LISTEN AS SHE LAY IN BED
SEE HER SOON
GOD BLESS HIM
MR THORNTON!--AND TO-NIGHT
MONTHS AFTER THIS LETTER CAME AND YOU SEE WHAT PROVOCATION FREDERICK HAD
NOW IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE LIVE SO MUCH MORE OUT OF DOORS EVEN CHILDREN AND EVEN IN THE WINTER BUT PEOPLE MUST LIVE IN TOWNS
THINK OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE SUFFERED BUT FATHER SAID SHE SUDDENLY LIFTING UP HER FLUSHED TEAR-WET FACE THE EARLY MARTYRS SUFFERED FOR THE TRUTH WHILE YOU--OH
LET EM HAVE TEN TIRE OF TEETH A-PIECE I CARE NOT ROLLO DUKE OF NORMANDY
AND I SHALL NOT ASK HER THEN WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT A THOUSAND THINGS YOU WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND
SHE TOOK IT ALL LITERALLY AND WITH SUCH GOOD FAITH THAT MARGARET COULD NOT HELP REMONSTRATING WITH HIM AS THEY WALKED SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE PARSONAGE BACK TO THEIR INN
WHAT DAMAGE THE STRIKE HAD DONE HIM
EDITH HOPED MARGARET DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE THEM THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS ABOUT ALL THIS
AND AS I DID NOT KNOW HOW I CAME TO YOU TO ASK YOU TO HELP ME
AT LAST HE WAS ROUSED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE TEA-TRAY BROUGHT IN BY A FLUSHED-LOOKING COUNTRY-GIRL WHO HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN FINDING SOME VARIETY FROM HER USUAL OCCUPATION OF WAITER IN ASSISTING THIS DAY IN THE HAYFIELD
YOU WOULD HAVE SENT--YOU WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM--IF HE WERE ALIVE
I'M TOO LATE AS IT IS WELL SIR I RECKON I CAN WAIT TILL YO COME BACK MR THORNTON WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET
AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE RETURNED CARRYING JOHNNIE HIS FACE ALL SMEARED WITH EATING AND HIS HANDS LOADED WITH TREASURES IN THE SHAPE OF SHELLS AND BITS OF CRYSTAL AND THE HEAD OF A PLASTER FIGURE
BUT IF YOU WOULD COME YOU WOULD FIND FRIENDS EVERYWHERE BESIDES DOLORES
TH MASTERS KEEP TH STATE O TRADE IN THEIR OWN HANDS
NOT IN THE CONTINUAL WHIRL AND DIN OF THE FACTORY
TO TELL THE TRUTH SAID HE HE FAIRLY BAMBOOZLES ME
I WHO HATE SCENES--I WHO HAVE DESPISED PEOPLE FOR SHOWING EMOTION--WHO HAVE THOUGHT THEM WANTING IN SELF-CONTROL--I WENT DOWN AND MUST NEEDS THROW MYSELF INTO THE MELEE LIKE A ROMANTIC FOOL
THEN THE RECOLLECTION OF BOUCHER CAME OVER HIM AND HE FACED ROUND WITH THE GREATEST CONCESSION HE COULD PERSUADE HIMSELF TO MAKE
SHE WAS SMITTEN WITH A FEELING OF INGRATITUDE TO MR THORNTON INASMUCH AS IN THE MORNING SHE HAD REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE KINDNESS HE HAD SHOWN HER IN MAKING FURTHER INQUIRY FROM THE MEDICAL MEN SO AS TO OBVIATE ANY INQUEST BEING HELD
THINK HOW YOU'D ABUSE ANY POOR FELLOW WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE WHAT HE COULD GET TO KEEP HIS OWN CHILDREN
CHAPTER IX DRESSING FOR TEA LET CHINA'S EARTH ENRICH'D WITH COLOUR'D STAINS PENCIL'D WITH GOLD AND STREAK'D WITH AZURE VEINS THE GRATEFUL FLAVOUR OF THE INDIAN LEAF OR MOCHO'S SUNBURNT BERRY GLAD RECEIVE MRS
AND YET THIS LAST STRIKE UNDER WHICH I AM SMARTING HAS BEEN RESPECTABLE A RESPECTABLE STRIKE SAID MR BELL
THERE'S ONLY MARTHA IN THE HOUSE THAT WOULD NOT DO A GOOD DEAL TO SAVE HIM ON A PINCH
WHAT MARTHA HARDLY KNEW FOR IT HAD HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS QUITE A LITTLE CHILD
SHE DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO HIM
JUST FOR ONE DAY
MARGARET MY DEAR CAN'T YOU HASTEN TEA MARGARET COULD ONLY HASTEN TEA BY TAKING THE PREPARATION OF IT INTO HER OWN HANDS AND SO OFFENDING DIXON WHO WAS EMERGING OUT OF HER SORROW FOR HER LATE MISTRESS INTO A VERY TOUCHY IRRITABLE STATE
I'M NOT FORTY-FIVE AND I'VE A DEAL O STRENGTH IN ME MEASTER BUT WHAT KIND OF WORK COULD YOU DO MY MAN WELL I RECKON I COULD SPADE A BIT AND FOR THAT SAID MARGARET STEPPING FORWARDS FOR ANYTHING YOU COULD DO HIGGINS WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD MAY BE GET NINE SHILLINGS A WEEK
HE THE ONE PRECIOUS BROTHER WAS THERE SAFE AMONGST THEM AGAIN
OR PERHAPS THE IDEA OF THE APPROACH OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE SIGHT OF THAT PALE UPTURNED FACE WITH CLOSED EYES STILL AND SAD AS MARBLE THOUGH THE TEARS WELLED OUT OF THE LONG ENTANGLEMENT OF EYELASHES AND DROPPED DOWN
I'D RATHER ANYBODY HAD THE HUNDRED POUNDS THEY THINK I AM WORTH THAN THAT RASCAL
THEY WERE NOW WORKING STEADILY THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT
PAPA I AM REALLY LONGING TO SEE THE PYTHIAS TO YOUR DAMON
BUT THEN YOU KNOW I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S BEDS
YOU WILL HAVE SOME ONE TO LOVE AND CARE FOR YOU OUT THERE
I WAS A LITTLE SICK SHE LET HIM TAKE HER HAND AND FEEL HER PULSE
THERE'LL BE MORE CHANCE O GETTING MILK OUT OF A FLINT
HOW WAS SHE EVER TO GO AWAY INTO COMFORT AND FORGET THAT MAN'S VOICE WITH THE TONE OF UNUTTERABLE AGONY TELLING MORE BY FAR THAN HIS WORDS OF WHAT HE HAD TO SUFFER
SHE WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HER SELF-POSSESSION
I KNEW IT WOULD SUIT HER THE MOMENT I SAW IT I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID MR LENNOX IN THE HALF-CONTEMPTUOUS HALF-INDULGENT TONE HE GENERALLY USED TO EDITH
MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL
BUT CERTAINLY WHEN SHE GREW ANIMATED SHE LOOKED AS WELL AS EVER I SAW HER DO SHE HAS HAD A GREAT DEAL TO GO THROUGH SAID MR BELL
MRS HALE SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO CRY
MAY I TROUBLE YOU TO COME INTO HIS ROOM DOWN STAIRS SHE SAW AND TRIUMPHED OVER ALL THE OBSTACLES WHICH DIXON THREW IN HER WAY
SPEAK TO YOUR WORKMEN AS IF THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS
AND JUST BECAUSE HE LIKED YO HE WERE VEXED AND PUT ABOUT DON'T FEAR BESSY BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
CHAPTER XXII A BLOW AND ITS CONSEQUENCES BUT WORK GREW SCARCE WHILE BREAD GREW DEAR AND WAGES LESSENED TOO
HE SAID HE WOULD TRY AND BRING IT TO-DAY MARGARET SIGHED
IF BY AN EFFORT SHE ATTENDED FOR ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WERE CONVULSED INTO DOUBLE RESTLESSNESS THE NEXT
WHEW
I BEG YOUR PARDON MA'AM
SO PUTTING ASIDE THE TOUCH OF SHYNESS THAT BROUGHT A MOMENTARY FLUSH OF COLOUR INTO HIS DARK CHEEK HE SAID
A FEW TEARS--THOSE WERE ALL SHE SHED BEFORE SHE RECOLLECTED THE MANY QUESTIONS SHE LONGED TO ASK
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT--WHAT WAS THEIR DEEP SIGNIFICANCE
HER LIE HAD SAVED HIM IF ONLY BY GAINING SOME ADDITIONAL TIME
SHE REALLY DID PERSUADE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUBMITTING TO SOME HARD EXTERNAL NECESSITY
TELL ME WHAT EVENING WAS IT
EDITH A SWEET LITTLE SPOILED BEAUTY
BUT NO MARGARET
AND HE HAD TO PASS THROUGH THE BUSIEST PART OF THE TOWN FOR FEMININE SHOPPING
SHE THREW THE WINDOW WIDE OPEN
MR HIGGINS
IT IS ONLY HALF-PAST TEN NOW I'LL ASK HIM TO GO OUT SKETCHING WITH ME
AND SHE SOFTLY ADJUSTED HER WORKING MATERIALS ON THE TABLE AND PREPARED TO LISTEN
I WILL COME AT WHATEVER TIME YOU NAME
BUT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR ALL THAT MARGARET GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND WALKED AWAY SICK AT HEART
YOU DID NOT APPEAR TO ME WORTHY OF HIM
AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN-STREAKED CLOUD-SHADOWED COMMON
AND SHE SAYS AND SAID AT THE VERY TIME TOO THAT SHE SAW MISS HALE WITH HER ARMS ABOUT MASTER'S NECK HUGGING HIM BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE I DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID FANNY
AND NOW ALL MARGARET'S ANXIETY WAS FOR THE TRAIN TO COME
BUT YOU OUGHT NOT TO LET HER ALLY HERSELF TO ONE UNDER SUCH A SERIOUS CHARGE WITHOUT SHOWING THE WORLD EXACTLY HOW IT IS YOU STAND
IF I'M GOING WRONG WHEN I THINK I'M GOING RIGHT IT'S THEIR SIN WHO HA LEFT ME WHERE I AM IN MY IGNORANCE
HONEST MEN ARE RUINED BY A ROGUE SAID HE GLOOMILY
MARGARET GENTLY ROSE UP AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER FRAIL MOTHER
IT WAS INDISCREET TO SAY THE LEAST
I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF BOUCHER
SIT YE DOWN SIT YE DOWN
RESTING HIS HAND UPON THE HOUSE-TABLE NICHOLAS HIGGINS STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOOR
I WOULDN'T GI'E THE PLEDGE THEY WERE ASKING
THERE HAD BEEN A PAUSE OF AN INSTANT ON THE STEEP CROOKED STAIR WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HIM
BUT A FILM CAME OVER HER EYES--HE WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME TO CATCH HER
I SUPPOSE I MAY CALL SAID HE COLDLY
MR BELL'S LETTERS WERE HARDLY LIKE HIS USUAL SELF
SHALL YOU--WILL IT BE A FAILURE HER STEADY VOICE TREMBLING IN AN UNWONTED MANNER
HOO DOESN'T COMPREHEND TH UNION FOR ALL THAT
SO I AM NOT LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO AVAIL MYSELF OF YOUR POLITE OFFERS AT THIS INSTANT MR THORNTON ENTERED THE ROOM
THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING ON SO MUCH AS TALKING AND LISTENING AND BUZZING WITH EXCITEMENT WITHOUT MUCH STIRRING FROM THE SPOT WHERE THEY MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE
IT WAS EVIDENT ENOUGH FROM THE STIFFNESS OF THE WORDING THAT MR LENNOX HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN HIS RELATION TO HER IN ANY INTEREST HE MIGHT FEEL IN THE SUBJECT OF THE CORRESPONDENCE
AND THE MORE UNEXPECTED THEY WERE THE MORE HONOUR TO HER ADMIRABLE HOUSEKEEPING PREPARATIONS FOR COMFORT
YOU SPARE THIN MEN ARE ALWAYS TEMPTING AND ALWAYS CHEATING DEATH
I CANNOT HELP IT IF THAT IS MY FIRST FEELING
WHY HE HAS TENANTS AND HOUSES AND MILLS THERE
SHE LEANT BACK AND SHUT HER EYES AND THE TEARS WELLED FORTH AND HUNG GLITTERING FOR AN INSTANT ON THE SHADOWING EYE-LASHES BEFORE ROLLING SLOWLY DOWN HER CHEEKS AND DROPPING UNHEEDED ON HER DRESS
WHAT WERE THE EXACT WORDS OF HIS NOTE
NO SOONER WAS SHE FULLY AWARE OF ONE LOSS THAN ANOTHER CAME--NOT TO SUPERSEDE HER GRIEF FOR THE ONE BEFORE BUT TO RE-OPEN WOUNDS AND FEELINGS SCARCELY HEALED
TAKEN MORE THAN HALF THE TROUBLE OFF MY HANDS AND HOW IS HE
BUT YO HEARD HIM SAY SO HELP ME GOD YES SAID MARGARET
IS MR THORNTON COMING TO TEA PAPA ASKED MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE
I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS AND I YIELDED TO THE RIGHT
PLACES WERE CHANGED--A TREE GONE HERE A BOUGH THERE BRINGING IN A LONG RAY OF LIGHT WHERE NO LIGHT WAS BEFORE--A ROAD WAS TRIMMED AND NARROWED AND THE GREEN STRAGGLING PATHWAY BY ITS SIDE ENCLOSED AND CULTIVATED
BUT WHAT I MEAN BY BELIEF JUST NOW IS A-THINKING ON SAYINGS AND MAXIMS AND PROMISES MADE BY FOLK YO NEVER SAW ABOUT THE THINGS AND THE LIFE YO NEVER SAW NOR NO ONE ELSE
OH PAPA PAPA CHAPTER XLII ALONE
AND I DON'T SEE THAT WE NEED ANY HIGHER OR HOLIER STRENGTH THAN THAT
HAD HER FATHER OUT OF A NATURAL LOVE FOR HIS SON CONNIVED AT ANY OH
THEY IMPRESS US ALL FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARD--EVERY DAY OF OUR LIFE WAIT A LITTLE WHILE SAID MR THORNTON
WOULD YOU GO AGAIN--IT'S A GOOD DEAL TO ASK I KNOW--BUT WOULD YOU GO TO-MORROW AND TRY HIM
MRS HALE DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE ANY ALTERATION IN HER HUSBAND'S LOOKS OR WAYS
TO PUT MYSELF TO RIGHTS IN HIS GOOD OPINION WAS I TO TELL HIM OF THE SECRETS OF OUR FAMILY INVOLVING AS THEY SEEMED TO DO THE CHANCES OF POOR FREDERICK'S ENTIRE EXCULPATION
THERE WERE THE REGULAR HOURS OF READING WITH HIS PUPILS BUT THAT ALL GIVING AND NO RECEIVING COULD NO LONGER BE CALLED COMPANION-SHIP AS IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN MR THORNTON CAME TO STUDY UNDER HIM
MR HENRY LENNOX ADDED A NEW AND NOT DISAGREEABLE ELEMENT TO THE COURSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD LIFE BY HIS FREQUENT PRESENCE
BUT WHEN SHOULD SHE SEE HIM
WHEN MRS THORNTON STRONG AND PROSPEROUS WITH LIFE CAME IN MRS HALE LAY STILL ALTHOUGH FROM THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE WAS EVIDENTLY CONSCIOUS OF WHO IT WAS
WELL I SUPPOSE YOU ARE ALL IN THE DEPTHS OF BUSINESS--LADIES BUSINESS I MEAN
HE SAW HER IN EVERY DRESS IN EVERY MOOD AND DID NOT KNOW WHICH BECAME HER BEST
THAT'S MY CREED
BEFORE SHE DID SO HOWEVER SHE HEARD HIM SAY IN A VERY LOW CLEAR VOICE IF MY TONES OR MODES OF THOUGHT ARE WHAT YOU DISLIKE WILL YOU DO ME THE JUSTICE TO TELL ME SO AND SO GIVE ME THE CHANCE OF LEARNING TO PLEASE YOU ALL THESE WEEKS THERE WAS NO INTELLIGENCE OF MR BELL'S GOING TO MILTON
IF THEY SHOULD HEAR BESIDES I MUST GO SAID SHE VEHEMENTLY
IT'LL NEVER BE AN HONEST UP AND DOWN FIGHT WI HIM AS IT WILL BE WI THORNTON
SHE BEGAN TO TALK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH CAME UPPERMOST IN HER MIND AFTER THE FIRST FLUSH OF AWKWARD SHYNESS
THEY STARTED ASUNDER IN THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT WAS BEFORE THEM
AND THEN HAVING NOTHING ELSE PARTICULAR TO DO SHE CRIED AND SAID THAT SHE KNEW SHE CARED MUCH MORE FOR MARGARET THAN MARGARET DID FOR HER
AND MOREOVER THE APPROVAL OF SEVERAL OF HIS FELLOW-WORKMEN TO WHOM HE HAD SPOKEN
WHEN DO WE GO ASKED MARGARET AFTER A SHORT SILENCE
THERE SAID THE WOMAN NOW YOU GO
HE HAS NO CAPITAL LAID BY
I CANNOT PRAY
MR THORNTON BEGAN TO THINK IT LONG FOR HE WAS FULL OF BUSINESS AND HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SPARE THE TIME FOR RUNNING UP TO CRAMPTON AND ENQUIRING HOW MISS HALE WAS
HOW IN THE WORLD HAD THEY GOT FROM COG-WHEELS TO CHEVY CHACE
BUT WHEN YOU COMPROMISED YOURSELF AS YOU DID AT THE TIME OF THE RIOT AND EXPOSED YOURSELF TO THE COMMENTS OF SERVANTS AND WORKPEOPLE I FELT IT WAS NO LONGER RIGHT TO SET MYSELF AGAINST MY SON'S WISH OF PROPOSING TO YOU--A WISH BY THE WAY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS DENIED ENTERTAINING UNTIL THE DAY OF THE RIOT MARGARET WINCED AND DREW IN HER BREATH WITH A LONG HISSING SOUND
SHE WOULD WAIT TILL THE DOWN TRAIN PASSED AND TAKE HER SEAT IN IT
HER SON HAD GIVEN HER A CARRIAGE
BUT DUN YO KNOW I HA DREAMT OF YO LONG AFORE EVER I SEED YO NONSENSE BESSY AY BUT I DID
WHAT HAD HE SAID
THEN SHE SAID I THANK YOU MOST TRULY SIR FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE
I BEG YOUR PARDON,--BUT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MR HALE IS
THE INHABITANTS OF EACH POOR SQUALID DWELLING WERE GATHERED ROUND THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IF INDEED THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NARROW WAYS--ALL WITH LOOKS INTENT TOWARDS ONE POINT
I SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN IN A WAY I HAD NO BUSINESS TO DO
MARGARET SUMMONED UP ALL HER FORCES TO HER AID
I AM OVERPOWERED BY THE DISCOVERY OF MY OWN GENIUS FOR MANAGEMENT
AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
MARTHA WAS GONE
MASTER FREDERICK TO BE SURE HAD GONE OVER UNACCOUNTABLE
BUT AS SHE RETURNED ACROSS THE COMMON THE PLACE WAS REINVESTED WITH THE OLD ENCHANTING ATMOSPHERE
I WENT A WILLING OLD VICTIM FOLLOWING THE CAR OF THE CONQUEROR
IT WAS WHO COULD DO MOST AND THE CHILDER ARE SURE OF A BELLYFUL TO-DAY AND OF KINDNESS TOO
CONVULSIONS CAME ON
I COULD GO WHILE MAMMA IS ASLEEP THIS AFTERNOON
MARGARET RECEIVED THIS LETTER AT BREAKFAST-TIME AND TURNED VERY PALE AS SHE READ IT
TO-MORROW YOU WILL COME BACK TO-NIGHT JOHN SHE HAD SELDOM PLEADED WITH HER SON AT ALL--SHE WAS TOO PROUD FOR THAT
I HAVE SO FEW HOURS LEFT--I FEEL DEAR AS IF I SHOULD NOT RECOVER THOUGH SOMETIMES YOUR FATHER OVER-PERSUADES ME INTO HOPING
BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEMSELVES ANY DAY
SHE MUST KNOW I AM ILL BECAUSE OF THE WATER-BED I DARE SAY SHE HEARS HOW YOU ARE FROM HER SON STILL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER
THE MERRY BRIGHTNESS RETURNED TO HIS EYES THE LIPS JUST PARTED TO SUGGEST THE BRILLIANT SMILE OF FORMER DAYS
PAPA HAS WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP SAYING THAT HE HAS SUCH DOUBTS THAT HE CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY REMAIN A PRIEST OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND THAT HE MUST GIVE UP HELSTONE
AS MARGARET SANK RATHER MORE INTO THE BACKGROUND ON HER AUNT'S JOINING THE CONVERSATION SHE SAW HENRY LENNOX DIRECTING HIS LOOK TOWARDS A VACANT SEAT NEAR HER
AND WHAT I WANTED FOR TO KNOW WERE THE RIGHTS O MEN WHETHER THEY WERE RICH OR POOR--SO BE THEY ONLY WERE MEN BUT FOR ALL THAT SAID MR HALE AND GRANTING TO THE FULL THE OFFENSIVENESS THE FOLLY THE UNCHRISTIANNESS OF MR HAMPER'S WAY OF SPEAKING TO YOU IN RECOMMENDING HIS FRIEND'S BOOK YET IF IT TOLD YOU WHAT HE SAID IT DID THAT WAGES FIND THEIR OWN LEVEL AND THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL STRIKE CAN ONLY FORCE THEM UP FOR A MOMENT TO SINK IN FAR GREATER PROPORTION AFTERWARDS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT VERY STRIKE THE BOOK WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH WELL SIR SAID HIGGINS RATHER DOGGEDLY
IT SEEMED ALL AT ONCE TO TAKE THE SHAPE OF AN IMPERTINENCE ON HER PART
SHE LOOKED INTO HIS FACE
IF HE HAD EVER HEARD HE HAD FORGOTTEN
SHE BENT TENDERLY DOWN TO LISTEN
BEAR UP MARGARET AND BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO HOPE MARGARET CHOKED IN TRYING TO SPEAK AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS VERY LOW
SHE SATE BY THE WINDOW ON THE LITTLE SETTLE SADLY GAZING OUT UPON THE GATHERING SHADES OF NIGHT WHICH HARMONISED WELL WITH HER PENSIVE THOUGHT
IT IS LITTLE MINGLED IN THIS PART OF ENGLAND TO WHAT IT IS IN OTHERS
YOU COULD NOT OFFEND HIM BECAUSE HE HAD NO VANITY HE IS NOT VAIN NOW SAID MARGARET TURNING ROUND FROM THE TABLE AND SPEAKING WITH QUIET DISTINCTNESS
YEARNING AFTER THE LOVELY HAUNTS SHE HAD LEFT FAR AWAY IN HAMPSHIRE WITH A PASSIONATE LONGING THAT MADE HER FEEL HER VOICE WOULD BE UNSTEADY AND TREMBLING IF SHE SPOKE
THE STRIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,--OR MORE FOR IT WAS NOW UNTIMELY WINTRY WEATHER IN A LATE SPRING,--THAT STRIKE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE NOW WAS OLD--HAD PREVENTED HIS COMPLETING SOME OF THE LARGE ORDERS HE HAD THEN ON HAND
MARGARET KNEW IT ALL
NOW I WON'T GIVE WAY
WHO IS THAT FINE DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING GIRL
AY
AY
AY
AY
TELL ME ALL YOU LIKE
I AM TIRED NOW JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE
I AM VERY WEAK IN MY SORE HEART;--I LOVE HER YET
YOU MUST GRANT ME THIS ONE POINT
BUT IF THERE WAS ONCE ANY NOISE O FIGHTING AND STRUGGLING--EVEN WI KNOBSTICKS--ALL WAS UP AS THEY KNEW BY TH EXPERIENCE OF MANY AND MANY A TIME BEFORE
SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM
AND I'VE LET ONE OR TWO OF THEM KNOW BEFORE NOW THAT THEY MIGHT THINK IT AN HONOUR TO BE EVEN THERE HIGGINS FOUND IT EASIER TO UNBURDEN HIMSELF TO ONE THAN TO TWO
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
THEN HE SAID
BUT WHERE WAS MR HALE
ONE IS UNINHABITED
SO HELP ME GOD
BUT A DAY OR TWO BEFORE MARGARET NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE HIM SMILE AGAIN
WILL THERE BE MUCH SUFFERING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
THEY WERE LIKE BOUCHER WITH STARVING CHILDREN AT HOME--RELYING ON ULTIMATE SUCCESS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO GET HIGHER WAGES AND ENRAGED BEYOND MEASURE AT DISCOVERING THAT IRISHMEN WERE TO BE BROUGHT IN TO ROB THEIR LITTLE ONES OF BREAD
MR HALE ASKED TO LOOK AT THEIR SKETCHES
AND HOW I REQUITED YOU WITH MY INSOLENCE THE NEXT DAY I REMEMBER HOW WRONGLY I SPOKE TO YOU,--THAT IS ALL LOOK HERE
SHE WAS A LITTLE STARTLED AT THE EVIDENT FORCE HE USED TO KEEP HIMSELF CALM
MR HALE WAS IN THE CORNER LIKE A NAUGHTY CHILD FOR HAVING GIVEN UP HIS LIVING.)--'BECAUSE I DARE SAY HE DISAPPROVES OF WAR AND SOLDIERS AND BANDS OF MUSIC
IT WILL GET COOLER EVERY DAY
I MUST WRITE TO THEM AT OXFORD TO SEE THAT THE PREPARATIONS ARE MADE
I'M A BACHELOR AND HAVE STEERED CLEAR OF LOVE AFFAIRS ALL MY LIFE
MARGARET KNEW IT WAS SOME POACHER
AND I NE'ER ASKED FOR IT BECAUSE GOOD WORDS IS SCARCE AND BAD WORDS IS PLENTIFUL HE WAS IN A MOOD TO TAKE A SURLY PLEASURE IN GIVING ANSWERS THAT WERE LIKE RIDDLES
AND SHE'S NOT GETTEN MARRIED MEASTER NOT YET THE FACE WAS CLOUDY ONCE MORE
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR HER RELIGION
BUT IT IS A COMFORT--A RELIEF--TO KNOW THAT MUCH
AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAD INTERVENED TO SEPARATE THE TWO FAMILIES UNTIL MARTHA WAS NEARLY GROWN UP WHEN HER FATHER HAVING SUNK LOWER AND LOWER FROM HIS ORIGINAL OCCUPATION AS CLERK IN A WAREHOUSE AND HER MOTHER BEING DEAD SHE AND HER SISTER TO USE MARTHA'S OWN EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST BUT FOR MRS THORNTON
I MAY SAY THAT WITHOUT LOVE--WIFELY DUTY--WHERE WAS I?--I HAD SOMETHING VERY PARTICULAR TO SAY I KNOW ONCE
DIXON WAS NOT OVER-FOND OF THE SUBJECT RATHER WISHING TO LEAVE THAT PART OF HER LIFE IN SHADOW
HIS TRIALS ARE OVER
GOOD-BYE BESSY
MARGARET INSISTED UPON GOING INTO THE FULL LIGHT OF THE FLARING GAS INSIDE TO TAKE THE TICKET
I HAVE ONLY SEEN MISS HALE FOR HALF AN HOUR TAKE CARE YOU DON'T GET CAUGHT BY A PENNILESS GIRL JOHN I AM NOT EASILY CAUGHT MOTHER AS I THINK YOU KNOW
AT ANY RATE HE HAS PROPERTY THERE WHICH HAS VERY MUCH INCREASED IN VALUE SINCE MILTON HAS BECOME SUCH A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
MR THORNTON HAS SENT ME SOME OF HIS OLD PORT WINE SINCE YOU WENT OUT
OTHER PEOPLE PROSPER AND GROW RICH AND HOLD THEIR PALTRY NAMES HIGH AND DRY ABOVE SHAME SHAME NEVER TOUCHED ME SAID HE IN A LOW TONE
IT IS THE FIRST CHANGES AMONG FAMILIAR THINGS THAT MAKE SUCH A MYSTERY OF TIME TO THE YOUNG AFTERWARDS WE LOSE THE SENSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS
BUT I BELIEVE I NEVER SHALL
MARGARET THOUGHT IT WOULD DO THE MILTON MANUFACTURERS GOOD TO ASSOCIATE A LITTLE MORE WITH OXFORD MEN
MARGARET'S LOW RICH VOICE WAS SOFTER THAN USUAL
HE MAY CARE FOR HER THOUGH SHE REALLY HAS BEEN ALMOST RUDE TO HIM AT TIMES
WHERE ARE WE
FORMERLY MARGARET WOULD HAVE COME TO HIM AS PRIEST AS WELL AS FATHER TO TELL HIM OF HER TEMPTATION AND HER SIN
SHE WAS UNWILLING TO IRRITATE ONE WHO WAS ALREADY GLOOMY AND DESPONDENT ENOUGH
I THOUGHT--I MEANT TO COME AND SEE YOU SHE SUDDENLY FELT RATHER SHY OF OFFERING THE VISIT WITHOUT HAVING ANY REASON TO GIVE FOR HER WISH TO MAKE IT BEYOND A KINDLY INTEREST IN A STRANGER
HE DID NOT LOOK AT HER
SHE TOOK UP THE OTHER AND WAS EXAMINING IT WHEN HER FATHER CAME IN SUDDENLY
BUT LET ME KNOW ALL I CAN ABOUT FREDERICK EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE NO HOPE AT PRESENT I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT AT HALF-PAST ELEVEN
HIS MOTHER'S EYES WERE BENT ON HER WORK AT WHICH SHE WAS NOW STITCHING AWAY BUSILY
BUT THERE WERE IMMENSE CHANCES AGAINST THE SUCCESS OF ANY SUCH PLAN
WAS HE ANGRY
HE MUST NOT BE TOLD YET
SO I SAID THERE WERE OTHER FAMILIES BE THANKFUL IF THEY COULD THINK THEY WERE EARNING AN HONEST LIVING AS I KNEW WHO HAD FAR MORE CAUSE TO BLUSH FOR THEIR SONS AND TO FAR AWAY FROM HOME
SHE FOUND NICHOLAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN MAKING A PENNY SPIN ON THE DRESSER FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THREE LITTLE CHILDREN WHO WERE CLINGING TO HIM IN A FEARLESS MANNER
WHERE YOU ARE THERE I STAY AND INDEED RETREAT INTO THE BACK ROOMS WAS OF NO AVAIL
AT LEAST THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD SEE FROM THE POINT AT WHICH THEY ENTERED IT
MARGARET MUST RETURN WITH HER AND THAT QUICKLY
WAS IT LAW BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE PROPERTY ASKED MARGARET IN A CONSTRAINED VOICE
THE GRAY AND YELLOW LICHENS THAT MARKED IT LIKE A MAP
I HAVE JUST CAUGHT A PACKET ON THE POINT OF SAILING--I AM OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
NO MERE BONNET WOULD HAVE MADE MISS HALE'S EYES SO LUSTROUS AND YET SO SOFT OR HER LIPS SO RIPE AND RED--AND HER FACE ALTOGETHER SO FULL OF PEACE AND LIGHT.--SHE IS LIKE AND YET MORE,'--HE DROPPED HIS VOICE,--'LIKE THE MARGARET HALE OF HELSTONE FROM THIS TIME THE CLEVER AND AMBITIOUS MAN BENT ALL HIS POWERS TO GAINING MARGARET
HE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY HE'D GO AND TELL POLICE WHERE THEY MIGHT FIND TH RINGLEADER O TH RIOT
BUT AS I'M TO DINE AT MR THORNTON'S AND PERHAPS TO MEET THE MAYOR I SHALL PUT ON MY VERY BEST GOWN YOU MAY BE SURE WHAT WIN YO WEAR ASKED BESSY SOMEWHAT RELIEVED
NAY MARGARET COULD EVEN DISCOVER THAT HE SPOKE FROM TIME TO TIME OF HER AND ALWAYS AS FAR AS SHE COULD LEARN IN THE SAME CALM FRIENDLY WAY NEVER AVOIDING AND NEVER SEEKING ANY MENTION OF HER NAME
JUST TELL ME MISS HALE ARE YOU YOURSELF EVER INFLUENCED--NO THAT IS NOT A FAIR WAY OF PUTTING IT;--BUT IF YOU ARE EVER CONSCIOUS OF BEING INFLUENCED BY OTHERS AND NOT BY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE THOSE OTHERS BEEN WORKING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
YO MAY TRUST ME THO I AM ONE O TH UNION I DO TRUST YOU MOST THOROUGHLY NICHOLAS STAY SAID MR HALE HURRYING TO THE BOOK-SHELVES
EVERYTHING ELSE REVOLTED ME FROM ITS HARDNESS
BUT TO MEN GROPING IN NEW CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE FINER IF THE WORDS OF EXPERIENCE COULD DIRECT US HOW TO ACT IN WHAT CONCERNS US MOST INTIMATELY AND IMMEDIATELY
SUSAN WAS NOT THERE
MARGARET WITH HER LONDON CULTIVATED TASTE FELT THE NUMBER OF DELICACIES TO BE OPPRESSIVE ONE HALF OF THE QUANTITY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH AND THE EFFECT LIGHTER AND MORE ELEGANT
HE HAD SEEN HER INTENT LOOK OF OCCUPATION AS SHE LISTENED TO MR HENRY LENNOX
BUT ONE HOUR--TWO HOURS OF HIS HARD PENETRATING INTELLECTUAL AS WELL AS BODILY LABOUR DID HE GIVE UP TO GOING ABOUT COLLECTING EVIDENCE AS TO THE TRUTH OF HIGGINS'S STORY THE NATURE OF HIS CHARACTER THE TENOR OF HIS LIFE
AND HIS WILL WAS TRIUMPHANT
YOU KNEW I DID NOT WISH YOU TO KNOW BUT AS IF TIRED WITH THE CONTEST SHE LEFT HER HAND IN MARGARET'S CLASP AND BY-AND-BY SHE RETURNED THE PRESSURE FAINTLY
FREDERICK HIMSELF WAS ROMAN CATHOLIC IN FACT THOUGH NOT IN PROFESSION AS YET
AND MARGARET FELL INTO THE OLD HABIT OF WATCHING AND ADMIRING AND MINISTERING TO HER COUSIN
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AGAINST HER NOT AGAINST HER MOTHER
SHE HARDLY KNEW WHETHER IT WAS MORE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
IF HE SHOULD BE EXECUTED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THAT HE HAS KEPT AWAY AND LIVED IN SAFETY
THE PATIENCE OF THE MAN THE SIMPLE GENEROSITY OF THE MOTIVE FOR HE HAD LEARNT ABOUT THE QUARREL BETWEEN BOUCHER AND HIGGINS MADE HIM FORGET ENTIRELY THE MERE REASONINGS OF JUSTICE AND OVERLEAP THEM BY A DIVINER INSTINCT
SOMETIMES HE SAYS A ROUGH THING OR TWO WHICH IS NOT AGREEABLE TO LOOK AT AT FIRST BUT HAS A QUEER SMACK O TRUTH IN IT WHEN YO COME TO CHEW IT
FANNY STOOD UP TOTTERING--MADE A STEP OR TWO TOWARDS HER MOTHER AND FELL FORWARDS INTO HER ARMS IN A FAINTING FIT
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER FATHER
YOU ARE UNFAIR AND UNJUST MARGARET COMPRESSED HER LIPS
AND IF ANY MAN IS INCLINED TO DO HIMSEL OR HIS NEIGHBOUR A HURT IT PUTS A BIT OF A CHECK ON HIM WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NO
WHAT CAN HE KNOW OF JOHN
THANK YOU FOR CALLING
SUCH A PLACE MY SON HAS EARNED FOR HIMSELF
IF YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THE CHANGE WHICH IT WAS TO HIM FROM HELSTONE
SHE HAD NEVER BEEN ALONG IT SINCE SHE PACED IT AT HENRY LENNOX'S SIDE
BUT MARGARET TOUCHING HIS ARM SHOWED HIM HER WATCH
IT IS ALL MYSELF
I DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE BEFORE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WAS OVER HE HAD FALLEN INTO A WAY OF CONVERSING WITH QUIET SARCASM
I AM DYING
I'M NOT MEANING FOR TO DOUBT HIS POWER SIR,--ONLY IT NEEDS A DEAL O TRUST AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY AFRESH
HE MIGHT OH DON'T BLAME HIM SAID MARGARET
MARGARET HAD A STRANGE CHOKING AT HER HEART WHICH MADE HER UNABLE TO ANSWER
AND MY WENCH HERE THOUGHT A DEAL ABOUT IT AND FLUSHED UP MANY A TIME WHEN HOO LITTLE KNEW AS I WAS LOOKING AT HER AT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE STEP
OR HAD WE BETTER SEND WILLIAMS FOR THEM NOW AND THEY COULD BE HERE BY THE TIME WE HAVE DONE TEA
I HAVE JUST MET WITH A GENTLEMAN FROM LIVERPOOL WHO WISHES TO SEE ME BEFORE HE LEAVES TOWN
IT WAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HE WAS SET DOWN NEAR HIS WAREHOUSE
IT IS HARD MOTHER HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS
BUT WHY MR HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID BUT THAT FIRST COMPLIMENT
THE LODGE-DOOR WAS LIKE A COMMON GARDEN-DOOR
AT THAT VERY TIME FRED WAS SAFELY OUT OF ENGLAND AND IN MY BLINDNESS I FORGOT THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER WITNESS WHO COULD TESTIFY TO MY BEING THERE WHO MR THORNTON
DON'T TRY AND MAKE A BUGBEAR OF AUNT SHAW SAID MARGARET LAUGHING
MRS THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HER MOUTH GREW SET WHILE MARGARET SPOKE WITH GENTLE MODESTY OF HER MOTHER'S RESTLESSNESS AND DR DONALDSON'S WISH THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE RELIEF OF A WATER-BED
MRS HALE OVERPOWERED BY ALL THE TROUBLES AND NECESSITIES FOR IMMEDIATE HOUSEHOLD DECISIONS THAT SEEMED TO COME UPON HER AT ONCE BECAME REALLY ILL AND MARGARET ALMOST FELT IT AS A RELIEF WHEN HER MOTHER FAIRLY TOOK TO HER BED AND LEFT THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS TO HER
MARGARET WENT OUT HEAVILY AND UNWILLINGLY ENOUGH
HERE IS MR LOWE COME TO SEE YOU MRS THORNTON SPOKE LOUDLY AND DISTINCTLY AS TO A DEAF PERSON
SHE COULD NOT TELL WHETHER HE HAD HEARD WHAT MRS HALE HAD SAID OR NOT
I THINK HE MUST MEAN MISSUS
AND THIS IMAGINATION OF POWER THIS PRACTICAL REALISATION OF A GIGANTIC THOUGHT CAME OUT OF ONE MAN'S BRAIN IN OUR GOOD TOWN
AND SHE AND STOPPED FULL SHORT
IN A WEEK THEY MUST BE GONE
IF THERE IS LESS ADVENTURE OR LESS PROGRESS--I SUPPOSE I MUST NOT SAY LESS EXCITEMENT--FROM THE GAMBLING SPIRIT OF TRADE WHICH SEEMS REQUISITE TO FORCE OUT THESE WONDERFUL INVENTIONS THERE IS LESS SUFFERING ALSO
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME ATTENTION SHOWN HIM
AY AND SEE VISIONS TOO
BUT GET MONEY MY PRECEPT IS DO SOMETHING MY SISTER DO GOOD IF YOU CAN
THE NEWS OF THE WORST BAD DEBT I EVER HAD NEVER MADE MY PULSE VARY
WITH MANY STARTS AND MUTTERED PLEADINGS
HE LAY ACROSS THE TABLE HELPLESS AS EVER
YES SIR TWICE OVER AS DISTINCT AS COULD BE
BUT MARGARET WHAT A BUNGLER YOU ARE
JANE IS WITH HER
IT WOULD SURELY BE THE BEST WAY OF GETTING OVER YOUR DIFFICULTIES WHICH I DO BELIEVE ARISE FROM YOUR IGNORANCE--EXCUSE ME MR HIGGINS--ON SUBJECTS WHICH IT IS FOR THE MUTUAL INTEREST OF BOTH MASTERS AND MEN SHOULD BE WELL UNDERSTOOD BY BOTH
THE INJURY IS NOT DEEP
THE NEW WINDOW GAVE A VIEW OF THE ROAD AND HAD MANY ADVANTAGES AS MRS HEPWORTH POINTED OUT
HE CEASED SPEAKING
I AM THE MOTHER THAT BORE YOU AND YOUR SORROW IS MY AGONY
DEAR DEAR PAPA I SUFFER FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE MY CHILD SAID HE WITH A DIGNITY THAT WAS ONLY TREMULOUS FROM THE ACUTE SENSITIVENESS OF HIS CHARACTER
SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE AND HAD COMFORTABLY KILLED OFF ALL HER ACQUAINTANCES WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN
MEURS DE HONTE AVEUGLE IMPUDENT TRAISTRE ET DESLOYAL A TON DIEU ET SEMBABLES CHOSES
BUT SHE WAS SO MUCH FATIGUED EVEN BY THIS SLIGHT EXERTION THAT IF SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER FORM OF ACCEPTANCE SHE COULD NOT HAVE SATE UP TO WRITE A SYLLABLE OF IT
HAMPER'S--THAT'S WHERE I WORKED--MAKES THEIR MEN PLEDGE EMSELVES THEY'LL NOT GIVE A PENNY TO HELP TH UNION OR KEEP TURNOUTS FRO CLEMMING
GO TOO WHEN HE HAD SO COMPLETELY VAULTED INTO HIS PLACE IN THE FAMILY AND PROMISED TO BE SUCH A STAY AND STAFF TO HIS FATHER AND SISTER
BUT THE MORE MARGARET FELT IMPERTINENCE THE MORE LIKELY SHE WAS TO BE SILENT ON THE SUBJECT
I'M SORRY TO HAVE GIVEN ANY UNNECESSARY TROUBLE MA'AM
HOW SHALL I BEAR IT
AND THE THOUGHT OF THIS CAME UPON HER WITH SUCH VIVIDNESS THAT SHE WAS SURPRISED HERSELF AT THE FIRMNESS WITH WHICH SHE ASSERTED SOMETHING OF HER RIGHT TO INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION
ARE THEY REALLY SO VERY DIFFERENT TO MOST PEOPLE ONE MEETS WITH SHE DID NOT MEAN TO VEX HIM
WHO'D HA THOUGHT THAT FACE--AS BRIGHT AND AS STRONG AS THE ANGEL I DREAM OF--COULD HAVE KNOWN THE SORROW SHE SPEAKS ON
I HAVE BEEN SO WANTING YOU
THE BEARING UP BETTER THAN LIKELY WAS A TERRIBLE STRAIN UPON MARGARET
HE COULD ALMOST PITY HER
I WOULD TAKE A LIVE DRAGON INTO MY HOUSE TO LIVE IF BY HIRING SUCH A CHAPERON AND SETTING UP AN ESTABLISHMENT OF MY OWN I COULD MAKE MY OLD AGE HAPPY WITH HAVING MARGARET FOR A DAUGHTER
T'OTHER CHAP HASN'T AN OUNCE OF MEASTER'S FLESH ABOUT HIM
AND HOW SUSAN LIGHTFOOT HAD BEEN SEEN WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS IN HER BONNET THEREBY GIVING EVIDENCE OF A VAIN AND GIDDY CHARACTER
AND IF SOME ARE COWARDS AND SOME ARE FOOLS THEY MUN COME ALONG AND JOIN THE GREAT MARCH WHOSE ONLY STRENGTH IS IN NUMBERS OH SAID MR HALE SIGHING YOUR UNION IN ITSELF WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL GLORIOUS,--IT WOULD BE CHRISTIANITY ITSELF--IF IT WERE BUT FOR AN END WHICH AFFECTED THE GOOD OF ALL INSTEAD OF THAT OF MERELY ONE CLASS AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER I RECKON IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE GOING SIR SAID HIGGINS AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN
WHOSE
WITHOUT LIFTING HIS HEAD HE SAID IF YOU DON'T LIKE SHOLTO TO BE SO LONG ABSENT FROM YOU EDITH I HOPE YOU WILL LET ME GO DOWN TO MILTON AND GIVE WHAT ASSISTANCE I CAN OH THANK YOU SAID EDITH I DARE SAY OLD MR BELL WILL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN AND MORE HELP MAY NOT BE NEEDED
AND WE DARE NOT
THEY CAN'T ABUSE THE MASTERS WHILE YOU'RE THERE
THOSE FLOWERS A LITTLE LOWER DIXON
YOU NEEDN'T LOOK SO FRIGHTENED BECAUSE YOU HAVE LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG TO A FAITHFUL OLD HERMIT LIKE ME
HOW IS MAMMA?--WHERE IS PAPA MISSUS WAS TIRED AND GONE INTO HER OWN ROOM
WHY DO I CARE WHAT HE THINKS BEYOND THE MERE LOSS OF HIS GOOD OPINION AS REGARDS MY TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT
IT WAS A MOMENT OR TWO BEFORE SHE COULD UTTER A WORD
MARGARET DISLIKED THE PROSPECT OF THE LONG WALK THROUGH THESE STREETS BEFORE SHE CAME TO THE FIELDS WHICH SHE HAD PLANNED TO REACH
YON THORNTON'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR TO FIGHT WI BUT TOO GOOD FOR TO BE CHEATED
WERE YO WITH HER
CRYING CHILD
MR HALE WENT ON
THE NEXT AFTERNOON ABOUT TWENTY MILES FROM MILTON-NORTHERN THEY ENTERED ON THE LITTLE BRANCH RAILWAY THAT LED TO HESTON
BUT YOU AND I WILL GO THIS AFTERNOON AS THEY WENT MR HALE BEGAN ABOUT HIS WIFE'S HEALTH WITH A KIND OF VEILED ANXIETY WHICH MARGARET WAS GLAD TO SEE AWAKENED AT LAST
THAT'S ALL HOW OLD ARE YOU ASKED MARGARET
BUT I ASK YOU WHAT PREPARATION THEY WERE FOR SUCH A LIFE AS I HAD TO LEAD
WHAT MUSIC WILL UNDO THAT SILENCE TO YOUR SENSE MRS
NO ORDERS WERE COMING IN
HOW MUCH LOVE HAD TO DO WITH THIS CHANGE NOT EVEN FREDERICK HIMSELF COULD HAVE TOLD
BESSY SAID PASSIONATELY NOW AM NOT I A FOOL,--AM I NOT MISS?--THERE I KNEW I OUGHT FOR TO KEEP FATHER AT HOME AND AWAY FRO THE FOLK THAT ARE ALWAYS READY FOR TO TEMPT A MAN IN TIME O STRIKE TO GO DRINK,--AND THERE MY TONGUE MUST NEEDS QUARREL WITH THIS PIPE O HIS'N,--AND HE'LL GO OFF I KNOW HE WILL,--AS OFTEN AS HE WANTS TO SMOKE--AND NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT'LL END
MARGARET WAS VEXED WITH HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING TIMED HER VISIT BETTER
AND NOW I MUST GO
AND REPLIED BY ANOTHER QUESTION
NO I CANNOT GIVE UP REVELATIONS
DON'T LET ME HEAR YOU TALKING SO
THE YARD TOO WITH THE GREAT DOORS IN THE DEAD WALL AS A BOUNDARY WAS BUT A DISMAL LOOK-OUT FOR THE SITTING-ROOMS OF THE HOUSE--AS MARGARET FOUND WHEN THEY HAD MOUNTED THE OLD-FASHIONED STAIRS AND BEEN USHERED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM THE THREE WINDOWS OF WHICH WENT OVER THE FRONT DOOR AND THE ROOM ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE
BUT THIS VISIT THAT I PAID TO YOU AT MILTON MADE ME HER SLAVE
DON'T SCOLD MARGARET
THE BLOOD-FLOWING HAD MADE MARGARET CONSCIOUS--DIMLY VAGUELY CONSCIOUS
IT WAS NOT FOR HIMSELF OR HIS OWN INJURIES HE REBELLED
I AM VERY SORRY SHE SATE DOWN ON THE GROUND AND LAID HER HEAD ON HIS KNEES
HOW MUCH MORE SO IF HE WENT TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE WHERE HE COULD NOT BE ENTERED TILL HE WAS EIGHTEEN
THE TEMPTATION HAD BEEN VERY STRONG
BE OFF WITH YOU I'M OBLEEGED TO YO FOR A YO'R KINDNESS MEASTER AND MOST OF A FOR YO'R CIVIL WAY O SAYING GOOD-BYE MR THORNTON DID NOT DEIGN A REPLY
I'VE LONGED FOR TO BE A MAN TO GO SPREEING EVEN IT WERE ONLY A TRAMP TO SOME NEW PLACE IN SEARCH O WORK
HER FEELINGS OVERCOME HER WHAT FEELINGS DO YOU MEAN NAY JOHN THERE IS NO NEED TO BE ANGRY
HAME HAME FAIN WAD I BE IT NEEDED THE PRETTY LIGHT PAPERING OF THE ROOMS TO RECONCILE THEM TO MILTON
OF POWER IN MANY WAYS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS MARGARET FELT HERSELF TOUCHED AND STARTED UP INTO A SITTING POSTURE
AT LAST IT STRUCK TWO
IT IS HOME AND I CAN'T PUT ITS CHARM INTO WORDS I SUBMIT
I MAY BE BUSY I'LL KNOW YO WON'T FORGET ME AGAIN
BUT HER FATHER SET TOO HIGH A STANDARD AND TOO ABSTRACT A VIEW BEFORE THE INDOLENT INVALID
WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN
BUT I THANK YO ALL THE SAME,--I THANK YO FOR MYSEL AS MUCH AS FOR BOUCHER FOR IT JUST MAKES MY HEART WARM TO YO MORE AND MORE BESSY SEEMED MUCH QUIETER TO-DAY BUT FEARFULLY LANGUID AND EXHAUSTED
A AN INDEFINITE ARTICLE SAID MARGARET MILDLY
THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THEM WAS OWING IN SOME DEGREE TO THE UTTER WANT OF SKILL ON THE PART OF THE IRISH HANDS WHOM HE HAD IMPORTED
I CAN NURSE MY MOTHER
HE HAD BEEN PRESENT ALL THE TIME STANDING WITH BENT HEAD BEHIND A GROUP OF PEOPLE SO THAT IN FACT NO ONE HAD RECOGNISED HIM
BUT SHE MISSED OUT OF THEM ALL HEARTY AND GENIAL ATMOSPHERE
EVERY MILE WAS REDOLENT OF ASSOCIATIONS WHICH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED FOR THE WORLD BUT EACH OF WHICH MADE HER CRY UPON THE DAYS THAT ARE NO MORE WITH INEFFABLE LONGING
THEY EVEN WENT THE LENGTH OF QUESTIONING HER BACK AGAIN
HOW MUCH THE DESIRE OF GIVING OUR HOSTESS A TEETOTAL LECTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE HAYMAKERS HAD TO DO WITH HIS EARLINESS I DON'T KNOW
BOUCHER STOOD WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE RATHER HIGH MANTEL-PIECE SWAYING HIMSELF A LITTLE ON THE SUPPORT WHICH HIS ARMS THUS PLACED GAVE HIM AND LOOKING WILDLY INTO THE FIRE WITH A KIND OF DESPAIR THAT IRRITATED HIGGINS EVEN WHILE IT WENT TO HIS HEART
HIS STEP AT LAST
MARGARET SAID HE AS HE FUMBLED WITH HIS GLOVES
BY SEVEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT MUST BE MADE TO HER MOTHER
AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF NOTES TO WRITE WHICH EDITH INVARIABLY LEFT TO HER WITH MANY CARESSING COMPLIMENTS AS TO HER ELOQUENCE DU BILLET
SHE'S A DEMOCRAT A RED REPUBLICAN A MEMBER OF THE PEACE SOCIETY A SOCIALIST PAPA IT'S ALL BECAUSE I'M STANDING UP FOR THE PROGRESS OF COMMERCE
OH DIXON WHAT A PLACE THIS IS INDEED MA'AM I'M SURE IT WILL BE YOUR DEATH BEFORE LONG AND THEN I KNOW WHO'LL--STAY
I THINK HE IS REALLY GETTING QUITE POLISHED IN HIS MANNERS MARGARET'S VOICE WAS MORE IN ORDER NOW
BUT NOW THAT HE LOOKED EAGERLY FORWARD TO EACH RENEWAL OF HIS INTERCOURSE WITH MR THORNTON SHE SEEMED HURT AND ANNOYED AS IF HE WERE SLIGHTING HER COMPANIONSHIP FOR THE FIRST TIME
MR HALE WAS READING ALOUD
TOO MUCH DAZED WI CLEMMING TO KNOW WHEN THEY'RE PUT UPON
HE SAID YOU MIGHT LIVE FOR YEARS
SHE HAD SEEN A DROP OF EAU DE COLOGNE ON THE POLISHED ARM OF THE SOFA AND INSTINCTIVELY SOUGHT TO WIPE IT OFF
THEN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO MILTON WITH A STRANGE SENSE OF THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE LIFE THERE AND HERE
THEY CAME RUSHING ALONG WITH BOLD FEARLESS FACES AND LOUD LAUGHS AND JESTS PARTICULARLY AIMED AT ALL THOSE WHO APPEARED TO BE ABOVE THEM IN RANK OR STATION
IT WOULD EVEN HAVE AFFECTED HERSELF AND RENDERED HER INCAPABLE OF TALKING AT ALL
BUT IT WAS SO FAR AWAY THAT IT ONLY REMINDED ME PLEASANTLY THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE HARD AT WORK IN SOME DISTANT PLACE WHILE I JUST SAT ON THE HEATHER AND DID NOTHING I USED TO THINK ONCE THAT IF I COULD HAVE A DAY OF DOING NOTHING TO REST ME--A DAY IN SOME QUIET PLACE LIKE THAT YO SPEAK ON--IT WOULD MAYBE SET ME UP
AND THE INSTANT AFTERWARDS TO REGRET IT NEARLY AS MUCH AS SHE DID ALTHOUGH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE I AM NOT SURE IF IT WAS NOT WORSE THAN BEING IN THE WORKHOUSE REPLIED HER HUSBAND
YO TRY THAT MISS
WHAT SLIGHT COBWEBS OF CHANCES STAND BETWEEN US AND TEMPTATION
SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST
PRAY DON'T HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER WORDS
MR HENRY LENNOX MARGARET HAD BEEN THINKING OF HIM ONLY A MOMENT BEFORE AND REMEMBERING HIS INQUIRY INTO HER PROBABLE OCCUPATIONS AT HOME
I HAVE HIT UPON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLAN
I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
NO PAPA
SHE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND SIGHED AND BELIEVED SHE FELT GLAD
THAT WOULD NOT ANSWER
MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY THAN SHE COULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE IN GOING TO HER OWN DEAR HOME THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS--AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
GO WHERE YOU WILL--I DON'T SAY IN ENGLAND ONLY BUT IN EUROPE--THE NAME OF JOHN THORNTON OF MILTON IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED AMONGST ALL MEN OF BUSINESS
NOW MARGARET COULD WORK AND ACT AND PLAN IN GOOD EARNEST
HE ANSWERED IN A DESPONDENT TONE
BUT FATHER NEVER WAS A DRUNKARD THOUGH MAYBE HE'S GOT WORSE FOR DRINK NOW AND THEN
I WAS A LITTLE RILED I CONFESS BY HIS MANNER AND THOUGHT OF THROWING THE WHOLE THING OVERBOARD TO SINK OR SWIM
HER FATHER'S FRIEND HER OWN FRIEND WAS LYING AT THE POINT OF DEATH
AND MARGARET HURRIED THE LETTERS INTO HER WORK-BASKET AND STARTED UP BLUSHING AS IF SHE HAD BEEN DOING SOME GUILTY THING
DON'T BE ANGRY WITH DIXON SAID MRS HALE ANXIOUSLY
FOR IT HAD BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THEM AT THE TIME OF THEIR CONVERSATION AT HELSTONE THAT THE EXPLANATION SHE HAD DESIRED SHOULD ONLY BE GIVEN TO MR THORNTON BY WORD OF MOUTH AND EVEN IN THAT MANNER SHOULD BE IN NOWISE FORCED UPON HIM
I HA GETTEN BRASS AND WE'LL GO BUY THE CHAP A SUP O MILK AN A GOOD FOUR-POUNDER THIS VERY MINUTE
SO HE LOST THE INTEREST OF THE CAPITAL HE HAD LOCKED UP IN MACHINERY
SHE LOOKS LIKE A CORPSE NOW OH I WISH MAMMA WOULD COME SAID FANNY WRINGING HER HANDS
MRS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED
AND HER WILL WAS A HOUSEHOLD LAW
BUT OTHERS CAME IN--MORE INTIMATE IN THE HOUSE THAN HE--AND HE FELL INTO THE BACKGROUND WHERE HE AND MR LENNOX TALKED TOGETHER FROM TIME TO TIME
THERE WAS NO NEED TO STRUGGLE FOR THEIR RESPECT
MUCH OF THEIR WORK WAS DAMAGED AND UNFIT TO BE SENT FORTH BY A HOUSE WHICH PRIDED ITSELF ON TURNING OUT NOTHING BUT FIRST-RATE ARTICLES
SHE WAS HALF AFRAID OF OWNING THAT ONE PLACE TO WHICH SHE WAS GOING WAS NICHOLAS HIGGINS
POOR DEAR SIR JOHN
SO SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT VACANCY
THERE'S THE MILL BELL RINGING MARGARET WENT HOME WONDERING AT HER NEW FRIENDS AND SMILING AT THE MAN'S INSIGHT INTO WHAT HAD BEEN PASSING IN HER MIND
I NEVER KNEW FANNY HAVE WEIGHTY REASONS FOR ANYTHING
EDITH CRIED SHE
NOT THAT SHE FULLY BELIEVED FANNY'S STATEMENT
IF SHE WENT TO SEE THE HIGGINSES SHE HEARD OF HIM THERE
DO WE PART HERE
THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE ADDED LOOKING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE CLOGS WERE ARRESTED IN THE HANDS THAT HELD THEM--THE COUNTENANCES SO FELL NOT A MOMENT BEFORE NOW LOOKED IRRESOLUTE AND AS IF ASKING WHAT THIS MEANT
HAD ANY ONE SUCH JUST CAUSE TO FEEL CONTEMPT FOR HER
I HADN'T SEEN HALE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND IF YOU REMEMBER I CAME--NO IT WAS SOME TIME AFTER THAT THAT I CAME
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU AFTER ALL
I WILL BEFRIEND HER IF THERE IS NEED FOR YOUR ASKING JOHN
CHEERLESS CHILL WAS THE DREARY AND DISMANTLED ROOM--NO FIRE NOR OTHER LIGHT BUT CHARLOTTE'S LONG UNSNUFFED CANDLE
MR HALE WAS THE FIRST TO DARE TO SPEAK OF THE NECESSITIES OF THE PRESENT MOMENT
DON'T FORGET MAMMA
DON'T FORGET MAMMA
HE DOES NOT ASK MY DEAR CHILD HOW YOU ARE SHIVERING SAID HER FATHER A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS
YOU SHOULD MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THE MORTIFICATION NOT ONLY OF A LOVER MARGARET BUT OF A MAN NOT GIVEN TO ROMANCE IN GENERAL--PRUDENT WORLDLY AS SOME PEOPLE CALL ME--WHO HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT OF HIS USUAL HABITS BY THE FORCE OF A PASSION--WELL WE WILL SAY NO MORE OF THAT
DON'T CRY MY OWN DEAR MOTHER
I'LL NEVER LEAVE GO ON THEE TILL THOU SAYST THOU WUNNOT DUNNOT BE A FOOL SAYS HE WORDS COME READIER THAN DEEDS TO MOST MEN
THAT COULD NA LEAVE ME TH BEST WIFE THAT EVER BORE CHILDER TO A MAN AN LOOK THEE LAD I'LL HATE THEE AND TH WHOLE PACK O TH UNION
BUT IF YOU MUST GO ON PREACHING KEEP IT TILL AFTER DINNER WHEN IT WILL SEND ME TO SLEEP AND HELP MY DIGESTION THEY WERE BOTH OF THEM TIRED AND MARGARET HERSELF SO MUCH SO THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GO OUT AS SHE HAD PROPOSED TO DO AND HAVE ANOTHER RAMBLE AMONG THE WOODS AND FIELDS SO CLOSE TO THE HOME OF HER CHILDHOOD
BUT A FAINT PINK COLOUR RETURNED TO HER LIPS ALTHOUGH THE REST OF HER FACE WAS ASHEN PALE
HER OWN FIRST THOUGHT OF HOW IF SHE HAD KNOWN ALL SHE MIGHT HAVE FEARLESSLY TOLD THE TRUTH SEEMED LOW AND POOR
I AM GLAD YOU DO ME JUSTICE AND SAID MARGARET BLUSHING EXCESSIVELY AS SHE SPOKE WILL YOU DO ME JUSTICE AND BELIEVE THAT THOUGH I CANNOT--I DO NOT CHOOSE--TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS OF MY CONDUCT I HAVE NOT ACTED IN THE UNBECOMING WAY YOU APPREHENDED MARGARET'S VOICE WAS SO SOFT AND HER EYES SO PLEADING THAT MRS THORNTON WAS FOR ONCE AFFECTED BY THE CHARM OF MANNER TO WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO PROVED HERSELF INVULNERABLE
AND THO I'VE BEEN ANGRY MANY A TIME AFORE NOW WI HIM AN HIS WIFE AS KNEW NO MORE NOR HIM HOW TO MANAGE YET YO SEE ALL FOLKS ISN'T WISE YET GOD LETS EM LIVE--AY AN GIVES EM SOME ONE TO LOVE AND BE LOVED BY JUST AS GOOD AS SOLOMON
IT WAS TWICE--TWENTY TIMES AS FINE
WHICH FELL NOT NEVERTHELESS FROM THEIR GRAVE AND STEADY LOOK
HE WAS CERTAINLY THE FAVOURITE
I HATE THEORIES I BEG YOUR PARDON
I'SE BEEN TRAMPING A DAY AND STREETS IS NONE O TH CLEANEST MARGARET THOUGHT THAT FATIGUE MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE IN HIS MANNER FOR HE WAS UNUSUALLY QUIET AND SUBDUED
BUT I MUST GO MISS THOUGH I'M WANTING TO HEAR MANY A THING
OR ELSE HE HAD AVOIDED COMING NEAR MILTON AS LONG AS HE COULD AND NOW THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO THIS NECESSARY VISIT WAS THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD SEE AND MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO COMFORT HIS OLD FRIEND
BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU
SO THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER IN SILENCE
AND AS FAR AS THAT WENT MARGARET'S ADMIRABLE SENSE ENABLED HER TO SEE WHAT WAS BEST AND TO DIRECT HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE
FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS BADLY OFF I DON'T DOUBT
HE FELT INCLINED TO GIVE A SHORT ABRUPT ANSWER MORE LIKE A BARK THAN A SPEECH TO EVERY ONE THAT ASKED HIM A QUESTION
MR HALE LISTENED AND TRIED TO BE AS CALM AS A JUDGE
HIS HEART THROBBED LOUD AND QUICK
IT TAKES A DEAL O WISDOM FOR TO DO ONY GOOD
HE WAS GONE
THERE HE WENT OSSING TO PROMISE AUGHT AND PLEDGE HIMSEL TO AUGHT--TO TELL A HE KNOW'D ON OUR PROCEEDINGS THE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING JUDAS
SOME ONE MUN THOUGH
HE TOOK UP ONE OF THE BOOKS LYING ON THE TABLE
ALL THE REST WILL YOU SEND TO MR BELL
HE'D SHOW THE WORLD THAT TH REAL LEADERS O THE STRIKE WERE NOT SUCH AS BOUCHER BUT STEADY THOUGHTFUL MEN
THERE IS A CURATE APPOINTED TO READ PRAYERS--A MR BROWN
MAMMA WANTS YOU TO HAVE A FOOTMAN OF YOUR OWN
HE GAVE A GREAT SIGH
NOT THE MEN
AND IT'S TH MASTERS AS HAS MADE US SIN IF TH UNION IS A SIN
MAN ALIVE--IF I THINK NOT I'M DOING BEST FOR THEE AND FOR ALL ON US
SHE FELT AS IF SHE NEVER COULD SLEEP AGAIN
BESSY HERSELF LAY ON A SQUAB OR SHORT SOFA PLACED UNDER THE WINDOW
THE STROLL DOWN TO THE BEACH TO BREATHE THE SEA-AIR SOFT AND WARM ON THAT SANDY SHORE EVEN TO THE END OF NOVEMBER
FANNY RAISED HERSELF UP
THAT IS NOT MUCH NOT IN DISTANCE BUT IN NEVER MIND
POOR DEAR PAPA
HER FACE HAD A LITTLE FAINT COLOUR IN IT AND THE VERY EXHAUSTION AFTER THE EXAMINATION GAVE IT A PEACEFUL LOOK
POOH
POOH
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT AT LAST BUT THAT WHICH MR THORNTON HAD DREADED FOR MANY WEEKS
BUT SHE COULD NOT READ IT
AND YET EVERYTHING THAT HAD SINCE OCCURRED HAD TENDED TO MAKE IT SO UNDESIRABLE
IT IS A SORT OF GIVE ME CHILDREN OR ELSE I DIE I'M AFRAID MY CRY IS LET ME GO TO CADIZ OR ELSE I DIE MY DEAR MARGARET
AND THENCE AROSE THAT INTERCOURSE WHICH THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING ALL FUTURE CLASH OF OPINION AND ACTION WHEN THE OCCASION AROSE WOULD AT ANY RATE ENABLE BOTH MASTER AND MAN TO LOOK UPON EACH OTHER WITH FAR MORE CHARITY AND SYMPATHY AND BEAR WITH EACH OTHER MORE PATIENTLY AND KINDLY
AND THUS SHE WAS ABLE TO MOAN AND COMPLAIN IN HER SOFT MANNER ALL THE TIME SHE WAS IN REALITY DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT FOR MR THORNTON WAS SILENT
HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MARGARET'S PRESENCE
MARGARET REPEATED YOU MAY LEAVE ME DIXON
I SHALL NEVER SEE HIS FACE AGAIN--FOR IF HE COMES TO ENGLAND HE WILL BE HUNG THERE WAS NO COMFORT TO BE GIVEN
FOR MARY AND ME WE KNOWED IT ALL ALONG ONLY WE HELD OUR PEACE FOR WE GOT IT THROUGH MARY WORKING IN TH HOUSE AND HE WAS OVER
BUT I HAVE PLANNED IT ALL
SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE COULD HAVE BORNE THE SENSE OF ALMIGHTY DISPLEASURE BECAUSE HE KNEW ALL AND COULD READ HER PENITENCE AND HEAR HER CRIES FOR HELP IN TIME TO COME
SHE SWEPT UP THE HEARTH ASKED AT WHAT TIME SHE SHOULD PREPARE TEA AND QUITTED THE ROOM WITH THE SAME WOODEN FACE WITH WHICH SHE HAD ENTERED IT
BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CITY AND THE REPRESENTATIVE MAN OF ITS INHABITANTS VERY TRUE MISS MARGARET
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER TRAIN IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
I DON'T KNOW SAID MR HALE AFTER A PAUSE
I SHALL SEND MY FATHER SOME RARE OLD SHERRY SUCH AS YOU CANNOT BUY IN ENGLAND,--(SUCH STUFF AS I'VE GOT IN THE BOTTLE BEFORE ME
I'VE BEEN A SEEKING WORK
HOWEVER THAT DIXON OF YOURS IS TRUSTY
I AM GOING AWAY FROM MILTON TO-MORROW
THAT WAS A FALSE ACCUSATION YOU KNOW BUT WE HAD NOT HEARD THAT FRED HAD SAILED HE MIGHT STILL BE IN LONDON AND LIABLE TO BE ARRESTED ON THIS FALSE CHARGE AND HIS IDENTITY WITH THE LIEUTENANT HALE ACCUSED OF CAUSING THAT MUTINY DISCOVERED HE MIGHT BE SHOT
DON'T BE VEXED WI HIM--THERE'S MANY A ONE THINKS LIKE HIM
I WERE FETCHED TO BOUCHER'S WIFE AFORE SEVEN THIS MORNING
AND EXAGGERATING IN HER OWN MIND THE SAME NOTION THAT HE HAD OF EXTRAORDINARY GOODNESS ON HIS PART IN SO PERSEVERINGLY KEEPING UP WITH THE HALES
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TEA WITH THAT FRIEND OF MR BELL'S
NOT IF YOU LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED MAMMA IS VERY PRETTY STILL
NOW SO TENDER AND THEN SO HAUGHTY AND REGAL-PROUD
THEY'LL HAVE KILLED THE GOOSE THAT LAID EM THE GOLDEN EGGS I RECKON AND SO YOU PLAN DYING IN ORDER TO BE REVENGED UPON THEM NO SAID HE I DUNNOT
WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER AND I'LL VENTURE TO SAY WE SHOULD LIKE EACH OTHER MORE AND YOU THINK THEY MAY PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF STRIKES NOT AT ALL
OUR GLORY AND OUR BEAUTY ARISE OUT OF OUR INWARD STRENGTH WHICH MAKES US VICTORIOUS OVER MATERIAL RESISTANCE AND OVER GREATER DIFFICULTIES STILL
THAT'S WHAT IT IS BUT SAID MARGARET DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE WAY ALTHOUGH SHE SAW SHE WAS IRRITATING HIM THE STATE OF TRADE MAY BE SUCH AS NOT TO ENABLE THEM TO GIVE YOU THE SAME REMUNERATION
ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR MOTHER
SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH
MR HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
WHO WOULD HA THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU HERE
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY--NOT AT WORK NOT AT WORK SURE ENOUGH SAID HE WITH A SHORT GRIM LAUGH
I NEVER REMOVED IN MY LIFE AND ONLY A FORTNIGHT TO THINK ABOUT IT MARGARET WAS INEXPRESSIBLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT HER MOTHER'S ANXIETY AND DISTRESS WAS LOWERED TO THIS POINT SO INSIGNIFICANT TO HERSELF AND ON WHICH SHE COULD DO SO MUCH TO HELP
THE LAST TIME SHE HAD PASSED ALONG THIS ROAD WAS WHEN SHE HAD LEFT IT WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER--THE DAY THE SEASON HAD BEEN GLOOMY AND SHE HERSELF HOPELESS BUT THEY WERE THERE WITH HER
NO OTHER PERSON IN MILTON--HARDLY ANY OTHER PERSON IN ENGLAND KNOWS
BUT MY SON I AM SORRY TO SAY CONFIRMED HER STORY
IT COULD NOT BE MUCH THAT A FELLOW OF A SMALL COLLEGE HAD TO LEAVE
HAMPER HAD SAID ONLY THIS VERY DAY THAT IF HE WERE RUINED BY THE STRIKE HE WOULD START LIFE AGAIN COMFORTED BY THE CONVICTION THAT THOSE WHO BROUGHT IT ON WERE IN A WORSE PREDICAMENT THAN HE HIMSELF,--FOR HE HAD HEAD AS WELL AS HANDS WHILE THEY HAD ONLY HANDS
MARGARET CAUGHT THE CLUE TO THE GENERAL CONVERSATION GREW INTERESTED AND LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
BUT OH
MARGARET WAS LESS ALARMED AS THIS DIFFICULTY WENT OFF COMPLETELY IN THE INTERVALS
SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO INDUCE MARTHA TO SPEAK OF ANY OF HER PERSONAL INTERESTS
AND I'M FEARED THEY'LL KEEP IT NOW AND EVERMORE
IT'S NOT MERELY THE COOKING IT IS THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE
NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
HOW SHOCKING
HOW SHOCKING
MY FATHER IS FROM HOME DR DONALDSON
BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN,--I KNOW YO WILL--BUT JUST SAY IT I WILL COME TO-MORROW SAID MARGARET
DR DONALDSON THANK YOU SAID MARGARET HASTILY HOLDING OUT HER HAND TO TAKE THE NOTE FOR SHE DID NOT WISH HER MOTHER TO HEAR THAT THEY HAD BEEN MAKING ANY INQUIRY ABOUT A DOCTOR
I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO BRAVE FOR ANY ONE ELSE JUST BECAUSE HE WAS SO UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO ME--IF INDEED I DO NOT POSITIVELY DISLIKE HIM
AND BELIEVING THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR INJURIES WOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON STRANGERS FAR AWAY AS THE INJURIES FANCIED OR REAL HAD UPON THEMSELVES
HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS
YOU ARE EACH OF YOU TOO INDIVIDUAL FOR THAT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER TO CONSIDER THAT AS A COMPLIMENT OR NOT
HER CLOTHES LOOK SHABBY TO WHAT THEY DID WHEN SHE CAME TO HELSTONE A YEAR AGO
I LIKE HIM FOR IT WELL SIR THIS STRIKE HAS BEEN A WEARY PIECE O BUSINESS TO ME
WHERE NOW WAS HER PROUD MOTTO FAIS CE QUE DOIS ADVIENNE QUE POURRA IF SHE HAD BUT DARED TO BRAVELY TELL THE TRUTH AS REGARDED HERSELF DEFYING THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE REFUSED TO TELL CONCERNING ANOTHER HOW LIGHT OF HEART SHE WOULD NOW HAVE FELT
MARY HURRIED OUT OF THE HOUSE CATCHING GLADLY AT THE OPEN DOOR AND CRYING ALOUD WHEN SHE GOT AWAY FROM HER FATHER'S PRESENCE
BUT SHE COULD HARDLY SMILE AT IT SHE FELT SO MUCH OUT OF SPIRITS
BUT ONLY THINK WHAT THAT TIRESOME HENRY HAS DONE
YET HAD ANY ONE COME WITH A FINE HOUSE AND A FINE ESTATE AND A FINE TITLE TO BOOT EDITH WOULD STILL HAVE CLUNG TO CAPTAIN LENNOX WHILE THE TEMPTATION LASTED
BUT SHE WAS SILENT
BUT I'M TIRED OF THIS BUSTLE
SHE STOOD IT QUITE CALMLY
IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT MR THORNTON HAD MADE TOO GRAND A WEDDING OF IT CONSIDERING HE HAD LOST A DEAL BY THE STRIKE AND HAD HAD TO PAY SO MUCH FOR THE FAILURE OF HIS CONTRACTS
HE LOOKED UPON HER FORTUNE ONLY AS A PART OF THE COMPLETE AND SUPERB CHARACTER OF HERSELF AND HER POSITION
IT REMINDED ME OF OUR OLD GAME OF HAVING EACH SO MANY NOUNS TO INTRODUCE INTO A SENTENCE WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHILD ASKED MR HALE
FOR SHE'S BEEN BUT A SICKLY SORT OF BODY I HEAR AND FEW HEREABOUTS KNOW MUCH ON HER MARGARET KNOCKED AT THE CLOSED DOOR
ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED THEMSELVES ON MARGARET'S NOTICE BUT DID NOT SINK DOWN INTO HER PRE-OCCUPIED HEART
HOO'S HAD HER PORTION ON EM
WE'VE MISSED IT AFORE TIME I GRANT YO
THERE WAS A LOW RING AT THE DOOR-BELL
IT WILL NOT TAKE A MINUTE MARGARET YIELDED AND LOST HER TRAIN
I KNOW IT NOW
MARGARET IT WAS VERY WRONG OF YOU
THEY WERE ALL DRAWN TOWARDS THE HOUSE-DOOR BY SOME IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE
THEY WERE TALKING OF WHAT ALL THE WORLD MIGHT HEAR
OH OF COURSE HE REPLIED WITH A CHANGE TO GRAVITY IN HIS TONE
HE HAD IT AND HE KNEW IT
YOU WILL BE SURE TO INQUIRE AFTER THEM?--AFTER HER MRS THORNTON WAS BY NO MEANS A TALKATIVE COMPANION TO FANNY NOR YET A GOOD LISTENER WHILE HER SON WAS ABSENT
DID NOT SOMEBODY BURN HIS HAND FOR HAVING SAID OR DONE SOMETHING HE WAS SORRY FOR
I COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN CARE OF ANOTHER MAN'S CHILDREN MYSELF IF HE HAD ACTED TOWARDS ME AS I HEAR BOUCHER DID TOWARDS YOU
I MAY HA LAUGHED AT THOSE WHO DID TO BRAVE IT OUT LIKE--BUT I HAVE LOOKED ROUND AT AFTER TO SEE IF HE HEARD ME IF SO BE THERE WAS A HE
THIS MUCH WAS OBSERVED BY SOME ONE ON THE PLATFORM WHO HOWEVER THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER AS THE BLOW SEEMED OF SLIGHT CONSEQUENCE
ALL THIS TIME MARGARET HAD A STRANGE UNDEFINED LONGING TO HEAR THAT MR BELL HAD GONE TO PAY ONE OF HIS BUSINESS VISITS TO MILTON
ONLY MARGARET FELT SURE THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE HER BROTHER AS A COMPANION AS MUCH AS SHE ALREADY LOVED HIM AS A NEAR RELATION
MRS THORNTON WENT ON AS BEFORE
HE HAD NEVER KNOWN--THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED AND HAD THE CAPABILITY TO RELISH--ANY KIND OF SOCIETY BUT THAT WHICH DEPENDED ON AN EXCHANGE OF SUPERB MEALS AND EVEN NOW THOUGH HE WAS DENYING HIMSELF THE PERSONAL EXPENDITURE OF AN UNNECESSARY SIXPENCE AND HAD MORE THAN ONCE REGRETTED THAT THE INVITATIONS FOR THIS DINNER HAD BEEN SENT OUT STILL AS IT WAS TO BE HE WAS GLAD TO SEE THE OLD MAGNIFICENCE OF PREPARATION
I WONDER'--(HALF TO HIS DAUGHTER IF MR THORNTON MIGHT NOT BE INDUCED TO DO SUCH A THING REMEMBER PAPA SAID SHE IN A VERY LOW VOICE WHAT HE SAID ONE DAY--ABOUT GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW SHE WAS UNWILLING TO MAKE ANY CLEARER ALLUSION TO THE CONVERSATION THEY HAD HELD ON THE MODE OF GOVERNING WORK-PEOPLE--BY GIVING MEN INTELLIGENCE ENOUGH TO RULE THEMSELVES OR BY A WISE DESPOTISM ON THE PART OF THE MASTER--FOR SHE SAW THAT HIGGINS HAD CAUGHT MR THORNTON'S NAME IF NOT THE WHOLE OF THE SPEECH
IT WAS A FOOLISH PROPOSAL OF MINE
DON'T LET THEM KNOW IT COMES FROM ANY ONE BUT YOUR FATHER
EVERY SIGHT AND SOUND--NAY EVEN EVERY THOUGHT TOUCHED SOME NERVE TO THE VERY QUICK
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MARGARET,--STAY EXCLAIMED HE LET ME HELP YOU AND HE GATHERED FOR HER SOME VELVETY CRAMOISY ROSES THAT WERE ABOVE HER REACH AND THEN DIVIDING THE SPOIL HE PLACED TWO IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE AND SENT HER IN PLEASED AND HAPPY TO ARRANGE HER FLOWERS
NOR DID SHE DISLIKE IT
OH SMART LONDON PEOPLE WHO VERY LIKELY WILL THINK THEY'VE THE BEST RIGHT TO HER
AND WITH JUSTICE I THINK
NEVER MIND
LATE IN THE EVENING THE EXPECTED BOOK ARRIVED WITH MR THORNTON'S KIND REGARDS AND WISHES TO KNOW HOW MR HALE IS SAY THAT I AM MUCH BETTER DIXON BUT THAT MISS HALE NO PAPA SAID MARGARET EAGERLY--'DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME
THE SHOCK HAD BEEN GREAT
HAVE YO BEEN IN LONDON YES
FARTHER THAN THAT--BEYOND ADMITTING THE FACT OF YOUR BEING AT THE OUTWOOD STATION WITH A GENTLEMAN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY-SIXTH--HE HAS SAID NOTHING--NOT ONE WORD AGAINST YOU
NOT BEAUTIFUL AT ALL WAS OCCASIONALLY SAID
WHAT BARGAINS SHALL I STRIKE THE PURSE AND THE GOLD AND THE NOTES IS REAL THINGS
DO YOU KNOW SAID MR BELL WHEELING ROUND AND SHUTTING ONE EYE THE BETTER TO BRING THE FORCES OF THE OTHER TO BEAR WITH KEEN SCRUTINY ON MR THORNTON'S FACE THAT I ONCE FANCIED YOU HAD A LITTLE TENDERNESS FOR MARGARET NO ANSWER
MARGARET HAD NOT EXPECTED MUCH PLEASURE TO HERSELF FROM MR BELL'S VISIT--SHE HAD ONLY LOOKED FORWARD TO IT ON HER FATHER'S ACCOUNT BUT WHEN HER GODFATHER CAME SHE AT ONCE FELL INTO THE MOST NATURAL POSITION OF FRIENDSHIP IN THE WORLD
BUT I WILL GO DIRECTLY AFTER DINNER
I PROMISED YOUR POOR MOTHER THAT AS FAR AS MY POOR JUDGMENT WENT I WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO ACT IN ANY WAY WRONGLY OR SHE SOFTENED HER SPEECH DOWN A LITTLE HERE INADVERTENTLY WITHOUT REMONSTRATING
OH NO
AND MARGARET FOUND THAT THE INDIFFERENT CARELESS CONVERSATION OF ONE WHO HOWEVER KIND WAS NOT TOO WARM AND ANXIOUS A SYMPATHISER DID HER GOOD
IT WAS PARLER DU SOLEIL ET L'ON EN VOIT LES RAYONS AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN CAME OVER MARGARET'S FACE AS SHE PUT DOWN HER BOARD AND WENT FORWARD TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM
A POLICE INSPECTOR CAME AND TAXED ME WITH HAVING BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE PUSH OR BLOW HAD OCCASIONED LEONARDS DEATH
THE WALKS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO DRIVE--ALMOST A SHAME TO RIDE SHALL YOU GARDEN MUCH
AND ONE WOULD BE PARTICULARLY SCRUPULOUS IN PAYING EVERY RESPECT TO A MAN WHO IS GOING DOWN IN THE WORLD HE HAD DROPPED HIS VOICE TO SPEAK TO MARGARET BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING
FEW CAME TO BUY AND THOSE WHO DID WERE LOOKED AT SUSPICIOUSLY BY THE SELLERS
SHE HAD SUNK UNDER HER BURDEN
SHE KEPT KISSING IT AND THE HOT TEARS SHE SHED BATHED IT
SO HE MOUNTED UPON IT AND WAS BORNE AWAY,--PAST LONG ROWS OF HOUSES--THEN PAST DETACHED VILLAS WITH TRIM GARDENS TILL THEY CAME TO REAL COUNTRY HEDGE-ROWS AND BY-AND-BY TO A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN
MARGARET WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MR HALE IN HER EFFORTS
AND MARGARET DETERMINED NOT TO TORMENT HERSELF BY THINKING OF WHAT SHE COULD DO NOTHING TO PREVENT
NOW HE HAD SEEN HOW SOFT AND BEWITCHING SHE LOOKED WHEN WITH A MAN SHE REALLY LOVED
I AM AWARE OF ALL THESE MISPLACED SYMPATHIES OF YOURS
THEN THERE WERE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS TO BE TRANSACTED IN THE STUDY WITH MR BELL
IN ONE OF THE LETTERS SHE HAD RECEIVED BEFORE LEAVING HARLEY STREET HER FATHER HAD TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD HEARD FROM FREDERICK
SHE NEVER BLENCHED OR TREMBLED
HER FATHER TOOK UP THE CONVERSATION
BUT ALL THIS TIME FOR THOUGHT ENABLED MARGARET TO PUT EVENTS IN THEIR RIGHT PLACES AS TO ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE BOTH AS REGARDED HER PAST LIFE AND HER FUTURE
SHE LIKED THE EXULTATION IN THE SENSE OF POWER WHICH THESE MILTON MEN HAD
OR IF THEY DO PLAY POMPS AND VANITIES IT SHALL BE IN DOUBLE SLOW TIME
FOLK WOULD GO WITH THEM IF THEY SAW THEM STRIVING AND STARVING WI DUMB PATIENCE
YET AFTER ALL MARGARET HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME IN THE DRAWING-ROOM BEFORE HER MOTHER CAME DOWN
OPEN IT QUICK SAID SHE TO THE ELDEST CHILD
HIGGINS NODDED TO HER AS A SIGN OF GREETING
MARGARET I WISH YOU DID NOT LIKE HELSTONE SO MUCH--DID NOT SEEM SO PERFECTLY CALM AND HAPPY HERE
CHAPTER XII MORNING CALLS WELL--I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
WHITE SILK SAID MARGARET
THE SPASMS WERE VERY BAD
AT HOME--BEFORE SHE CAME TO LIVE IN HARLEY STREET--HER MOTHER'S DRESSING-ROOM HAD BEEN HER NURSERY
BUT HER THOUGHTS MADE ANSWER SOMETHING LIKE DANIEL O'ROURKE WHEN THE MAN-IN-THE-MOON ASKED HIM TO GET OFF HIS REAPING-HOOK
SHE MUST JUST SUBMIT LIKE MANY ANOTHER TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD
ONCE OR TWICE SHE CAME UP TO KISS HIM
IF I WERE YOU AS HE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM HE SAID MR HALE IS GOOD AND GENTLE AND LEARNED
YOU ARE MY CHILD MARGARET
MORE CLOSELY HIDDEN WAS THE FACE ALMOST RESTING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER
BUT THOU WERT SHELTERED BEHIND A WOMAN MR THORNTON QUIVERED WITH RAGE
THESE GOOD PEOPLE I SEE ARE AT DINNER SAID HE CLOSING THE DOOR OF THE PORTER'S LODGE
ALL THOUGHTS OF QUIET HABITUAL LOVE OF TENDERNESS FOR YEARS OF RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEAD,--ALL THAT INEXPLICABLE LIKENESS IN LOOK TONE AND GESTURE THAT SEEM TO BELONG TO ONE FAMILY AND WHICH REMINDED MARGARET SO FORCIBLY AT THIS MOMENT OF HER MOTHER,--CAME IN TO MELT AND SOFTEN HER NUMBED HEART INTO THE OVERFLOW OF WARM TEARS
HOW LATE IT IS SHE SPOKE VERY LANGUIDLY AND SUFFERED DIXON TO LAY IT ON THE COUNTERPANE BEFORE HER WITHOUT PUTTING OUT A HAND TO LAKE IT
YOU MUST HAVE MANY PAINFUL THINGS TO DO MR HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY
HE DID NOT LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE
BUT I'D RATHER NOT
YOU ONLY DO ME JUSTICE
MY POOR MARIA OH PAPA
BUT LORD BLESS YO IT WENT ON ABOUT CAPITAL AND LABOUR AND LABOUR AND CAPITAL TILL IT FAIR SENT ME OFF TO SLEEP
BUT AS SOON AS THE NEWLY-STARTED SUBJECT HAD COME TO A CLOSE MR THORNTON RESUMED THE CONVERSATION JUST WHERE IT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED AND GAVE MR COLTHURST THE REPLY TO HIS INQUIRY
WHY YOU ARE GETTING ON FAMOUSLY I HEAR YES SIR
OR QUIETLY PROFESSING TO DESPISE PEOPLE FOR CARELESS WASTEFUL IMPROVIDENCE WITHOUT EVER SEEMING TO THINK IT HIS DUTY TO TRY TO MAKE THEM DIFFERENT,--TO GIVE THEM ANYTHING OF THE TRAINING WHICH HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM AND TO WHICH HE EVIDENTLY OWES HIS POSITION WHATEVER THAT MAY BE
MARGARET I SEE HIM NOW DON'T GO ON MAMMA
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT ANY MORE ABOUT IT TILL HIS EVIDENCE WAS ROUTED OUT BY THE INSPECTOR WHO ON MAKING SOME FARTHER INQUIRY AT THE RAILROAD STATION HAD HEARD FROM THE STATION-MASTER THAT A YOUNG LADY AND GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN THERE ABOUT THAT HOUR--THE LADY REMARKABLY HANDSOME--AND SAID BY SOME GROCER'S ASSISTANT PRESENT AT THE TIME TO BE A MISS HALE LIVING AT CRAMPTON WHOSE FAMILY DEALT AT HIS SHOP
FOR POOR FRED WAS SUCH A FINE FELLOW ONLY PERHAPS RATHER TOO PASSIONATE
SEVENTY YEARS AGO WHAT WAS IT
IT'S NOT JOHN BOUCHER
IT'S NOT JOHN BOUCHER
CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
FOOD IS MUCH THE SAME AS HERE EXCEPT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE GARDEN THE CHILDER COULD WORK AT THAT SAID HE
I AM MORE AND MORE CONVINCED THAT THIS AIR IS BAD FOR YOU AND MAKES YOU LOOK SO PALE AND ILL
MARGARET WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP THE EFFORT IN DESPAIR TO ROUSE MR HALE OUT OF HIS DEJECTION
HE SPOKE AS IF THIS CONSEQUENCE WERE SO ENTIRELY LOGICAL THAT NEITHER EMPLOYERS NOR EMPLOYED HAD ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN IF IT BECAME THEIR FATE
PUT OUT OF HIS PLACE BY A PADDY THAT DID NA KNOW WEFT FRO WARP WELL
LOOK HIGGINS
THIS I BELIEVE IS THE PRINCIPAL STREET IN MILTON
BUT I DID NOT ASK
TO BE CHOSEN BY JOHN WOULD SEPARATE A KITCHEN-WENCH FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
MARY HAD ONLY COME IN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE DIED
I MUST GO TO-MORROW SAID FREDERICK DECIDEDLY
AND YET THEY KNEW IT WAS ONLY DIXON'S MEASURED TREAD
MISS HALE IS BUSY AND SHE CAN'T COME OR ELSE SHE WOULD THE GIRL LOOKED WISTFULLY AT MARGARET
CHAPTER XLVII SOMETHING WANTING EXPERIENCE LIKE A PALE MUSICIAN HOLDS A DULCIMER OF PATIENCE IN HIS HAND
MOTHER COME ROUND THE GARDEN WITH ME THIS MORNING
THEN SHE REPLIED IF YO'D LED THE LIFE I HAVE AND GETTEN AS WEARY OF IT AS I HAVE AND THOUGHT AT TIMES MAYBE IT'LL LAST FOR FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS--IT DOES WI SOME,"--AND GOT DIZZY AND DAZED AND SICK AS EACH OF THEM SIXTY YEARS SEEMED TO SPIN ABOUT ME AND MOCK ME WITH ITS LENGTH OF HOURS AND MINUTES AND ENDLESS BITS O TIME--OH WENCH
HEAVED WITH PASSION
HE CALLED HIMSELF A FOOL FOR SUFFERING SO
HE WAS BORN WITH THE GIFT OF WINNING HEARTS
AND IF I DID SEE A FRIEND WHO OSSED TO TREAT ME I NEVER KNEW HOO LAY A-DYING HERE
NOR INDEED COULD SHE ATTEND TO WHAT HE READ SO GREAT WAS HER INTERNAL AGITATION
IT WAS A BITTER MORTIFICATION TO HER IN ONE SENSE
I GOT INTO A WAKEFUL HABIT WHEN POOR FREDERICK WAS AT SEA
WHEN SHE TOOK THEM AWAY HER PALMS WERE WET WITH SCALDING TEARS
THE CHILDREN SEEING THEIR LITTLE DUTIES LIE IN ACTION CLOSE AROUND THEM BEGAN TO TRY EACH ONE TO DO SOMETHING THAT SHE SUGGESTED TOWARDS REDDING UP THE SLATTERNLY ROOM
SOMETIMES I USED TO HEAR A FARMER SPEAKING SHARP AND LOUD TO HIS SERVANTS
HE ENTERED THE ROOM TAKING IN AT A GLANCE THE FACT OF MARGARET'S PRESENCE
I THINK I COULD GO THROUGH MY OWN WITH PATIENCE
MR THORNTON HEARD BUT DID NOT CARE TO REPLY
AND IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO THAW A LITTLE FROM HER ZENOBIA WAYS
ON HIS WAY OVERCOME BY PAIN OR DRINK HE HAD LAIN DOWN IN THE ROAD WHERE THE POLICE HAD FOUND HIM AND TAKEN HIM TO THE INFIRMARY
I CANNOT ENDURE TO THINK OF IT
PERHAPS NOT AT ALL
MY FATHER BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR NOT A MINUTE AGO BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT TOLD THAT YOU WERE HERE AND HE HAS GONE AWAY ON SOME BUSINESS
THEIR OPINIONS CLASHED
TO BE SURE IT ACCOUNTS A LITTLE FOR BUT HE ALWAYS SPEAKS OF YOU WITH REGARD AND ESTEEM THOUGH NOW I UNDERSTAND CERTAIN RESERVATIONS IN HIS MANNER MARGARET DID NOT SPEAK
THERE ARE SOLDIERS ALL ROUND THE PLACE SEEKING FOR THEIR WORK NOW IT IS TOO LATE
MARGARET FELT STUNNED AND UNABLE TO RECOVER HER SELF-POSSESSION ENOUGH TO JOIN IN THE TRIVIAL CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED BETWEEN HER FATHER AND MR LENNOX
AND HE WAS INFIDEL SO FAR AS HE HAD NEVER YET FOUND ANY FORM OF FAITH TO WHICH HE COULD ATTACH HIMSELF HEART AND SOUL
I KNEW SHE COULD NOT BE UNMAIDENLY
WHISKERS SUCH AS I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO WEAR--THEY ARE SO RED
IN A MOMENT SHE WAS UP AGAIN AS STRAIGHT AS EVER,--A GRIM SMILE UPON HER FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY READY FOR THE DOOR OPENING AND THE REJOICING TRIUMPHANT ONE WHO SHOULD NEVER KNOW THE SORE REGRET HIS MOTHER FELT AT HIS MARRIAGE
AND DO YOU GO TO YOUR IRISH PEOPLE WHO ARE CRYING AND SHOUTING AS IF THEY WERE MAD WITH FRIGHT HE WENT
EDITH CAME INTO MARGARET'S BEDROOM THE FIRST TIME IN HER HABIT THE SECOND READY DRESSED FOR DINNER
FOLK SELDOM LIVES I MILTON JUST FOR PLEASURE IF THEY CAN LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
THE CANDLES WERE FLICKERING IN THEIR SOCKETS
HE WAS TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT
I SAID A WOMAN WHO KNEW NO BETTER HAD ADVISED ME FOR TO COME AND SEE IF THERE WAS A SOFT PLACE IN HIS HEART AND HE ASKED MARGARET
SURELY YOU CAN CHARM THE LANDLORD INTO RE-PAPERING ONE OR TWO OF THE ROOMS--THE DRAWING-ROOM AND YOUR BED-ROOM--FOR MAMMA WILL COME MOST IN CONTACT WITH THEM
THEY SPOKE BUT FEW WORDS
BUT WHETHER IN SUMMER AUTUMN OR WINTER IT WOULD SIGNIFY VERY LITTLE
ALL THEIR EFFORTS HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO MAKE HER MOTHER'S ROOM COMFORTABLE
HE COULD NOT EVEN SHAKE OFF THE RECOLLECTION THAT SHE HAD BEEN THERE
BUT TO MARGARET HE ONLY SAID IF YOUR MOTHER GOES TO SLEEP BE SURE YOU COME DIRECTLY MARGARET WENT INTO HER MOTHER'S ROOM
SHE NEVER MEANT ME TO BE EXPOSED TO INSULT I AM SURE INSULT MISS HALE YES MADAM SAID MARGARET MORE STEADILY IT IS INSULT
WHERE DID YE GET THIS FROCK IN LONDON SAID MARGARET MUCH AMUSED
WE DO NOT REASON--WE BELIEVE
YOUR BAD WEATHER AND YOUR BAD TIMES ARE MY GOOD ONES
FOR THEY SAW THAT HIS GRIEF WAS VERY GREAT CHAPTER VII NEW SCENES AND FACES MIST CLOGS THE SUNSHINE SMOKY DWARF HOUSES HAVE WE ROUND ON EVERY SIDE MATTHEW ARNOLD
BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE IN THE FULL BUSINESS OF THE LONDON SEASON AND MARGARET WAS OFTEN LEFT ALONE
DO I NOT KNOW ANXIETY THOUGH I GO ABOUT WELL-DRESSED AND HAVE FOOD ENOUGH
AS THE SPIRIT TOUCHED THE WOUND WHICH TILL THEN NEITHER MRS THORNTON NOR JANE HAD PERCEIVED MARGARET OPENED HER EYES
IT IS ONLY US
I WANT YOU TO SEE EDITH
BE DOMNED TO TH WHOLE CRUEL WORLD O YO
YOU SUPPOSE THAT OUR MEN ARE PUPPETS OF DOUGH READY TO BE MOULDED INTO ANY AMIABLE FORM WE PLEASE
THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXHAUSTED BY THEIR TERROR TO DO MORE THAN DECIDE UPON THE IMMEDIATE COURSE OF ACTION
THEY HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE SIGHING THAT THE EYES OF EACH CALLED TO THE OTHER TO BRING UP FROM THE DEPTHS OF HER HEART
NOW TWO THINGS MORE AND I HAVE DONE
AND I BELIEVE IT TO BE AS MUCH A NECESSITY AS THAT PRUDENT WISDOM AND GOOD CONDUCT ARE ALWAYS OPPOSED TO AND DOING BATTLE WITH IGNORANCE AND IMPROVIDENCE
I ONLY NAME SUCH THINGS TO SHOW WHAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER THE MANUFACTURERS HAD ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY
I DON'T WANT DONATIONS
WE CAN'T EITHER OF US TALK ABOUT IT TO-NIGHT I BELIEVE SAID SHE FINDING THAT TEARS AND SOBS WOULD COME IN SPITE OF HERSELF
AND MARGARET TURNED FAINT AT HEART WHEN SHE HEARD HER FATHER'S STEP IN THE HALL
I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO BE MY PARTNER NOW WOULDN'T YOU
THE LEAVES WERE MORE GORGEOUS THAN EVER
MOTHER BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN MRS HALE
MY BOY YOU MUST GO
FOR DOLORES SAKE THEY OUGHT TO KNOW BUT HOW MUST I MAKE THEM KNOW
IT'S MISS HALE JENNY SAID SHE RUNNING TO THE DOOR AND CALLING TO HER DAUGHTER
I RECKON I WOULD HA GUIDED BOUCHER TO A BETTER END
IT STRUCK ME SAID FREDERICK THAT YOUR INTRODUCTION LITTLE SISTER OF MINE WENT A LONG WAY
HE WAS HIS FATHER'S DARLING HE IS HIS FATHER'S DARLING SAID THE WOMAN RISING HASTILY AND STANDING FACE TO FACE WITH MARGARET
IT'S A VERY WELL FOR HAPPY FOLK MARGARET TOUCHED HIS ARM VERY SOFTLY
MARGARET DID NOT SPEAK BUT HELD THE WATER TO HER LIPS
HE LOOKED AT HER FACE AND SAW AN EXPRESSION UPON IT OF SURPRISE AND EXTREMEST SORROW BUT NOT THE AGONY OF TERROR THAT CONTRACTED HIS OWN UNPREPARED HEART
THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT HER EYE WAS THE DATE TWO DAYS EARLIER THAN SHE RECEIVED IT
SPEAK TO HIM MISS HALE
NO ONE WAS CONSIDERED SO WISE AND FAR-SEEING AS MR WATSON
PRAY LET US BOTH FORGET THAT ALL THIS DISAGREEABLE SHE WAS GOING TO SAY BUT STOPPED SHORT CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN PLACE HE PAUSED BEFORE HE REPLIED
MARGARET LOVES HER WITH ALL HER HEART AND EDITH WITH AS MUCH OF HER HEART AS SHE CAN SPARE NOW HALE
SO WE WILL GIVE HIM A WELCOME AND SOME COCOA-NUT CAKES
ALL OUT-OF-DOORS PLEASURE-SEEKING AND GLAD EDITH'S LIFE SEEMED LIKE THE DEEP VAULT OF BLUE SKY ABOVE HER FREE--UTTERLY FREE FROM FLECK OR CLOUD
DO THEY TEACH TOO
SHE SAW THE ROOMS THAT HE HAD OCCUPIED AND ASSOCIATED THEM EVER AFTER MOST FONDLY IN HER MEMORY WITH THE IDEA OF HER FATHER AND HIS ONE CHERISHED AND FAITHFUL FRIEND
I'LL STAND THERE FRO SIX IN THE MORNING TILL I GET SPEECH ON HIM
BUT WHERE SHALL WE SIT OH
THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED MARGARET RESOLVED TO KEEP SILENCE
BUT MORE FREQUENTLY PLANNING HOW SOON SHE COULD GET MARGARET AWAY FROM THAT HORRID PLACE AND BACK INTO THE PLEASANT COMFORTS OF HARLEY STREET
THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
SO I SAY HOORAY FOR THE STRIKE AND LET THORNTON AND SLICKSON AND HAMPER AND THEIR SET LOOK TO IT THORNTON SAID MARGARET
I HAVE NEVER YET PUT MYSELF AND I MEAN NEVER TO PUT MYSELF WITHIN REACH OF HER CONTEMPT CONTEMPT INDEED!'--(ONE OF MRS THORNTON'S EXPRESSIVE SNORTS.)--'DON'T GO ON SPEAKING OF MISS HALE JOHN IF I'VE TO BE KIND TO HER
OR I MAY NOT
I GO THERE EVERY FOUR OR FIVE YEARS--AND I WAS BORN THERE--YET I DO ASSURE YOU I OFTEN LOSE MY WAY--AYE AMONG THE VERY PILES OF WAREHOUSES THAT ARE BUILT UPON MY FATHER'S ORCHARD
YES VERY LIKE
BUT SMILES WERE CHANGED TO WHITE AND TREMBLING LOOKS WHEN THEY SAW DIXON'S FACE AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR
WE MUST BE CONTENT WITH CAPTAIN LENNOX
I'LL COME BACK TO YOU BEFORE LONG
MARGARET'S HAND LAY IN FREDERICK'S ARM
DIXON HAS OFFERED TO GO WITH ME BUT I COULD HAVE GONE BY MYSELF
BUT I ALMOST WISH YOU HAD NOT WRITTEN
FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO-DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
SIX MEN WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THREE OF THEM BEING POLICEMEN
HE HAD THOUGHT OF COMING DOWN TO MILTON AGAIN
ONLY I'M SILLY DIXON AND WANT A GLASS OF WATER
I AM AWARE OF WHAT I MUST APPEAR TO YOU BUT THE SECRET IS ANOTHER PERSON'S AND I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT WITHOUT DOING HIM HARM I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO PRY INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S SECRETS HE SAID WITH GROWING ANGER
SHE WOULD TELL THAT LIE AGAIN
AND WAS NEVER COMFORTABLE UNLESS FREDERICK SATE OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE VIEW OF ANY ONE ENTERING THE ROOM
HIS MACHINERY IS NEW WITHIN THESE TWO YEARS AND HAS COST HIM--WE WON'T SAY WHAT!--A WORD TO THE WISE BUT THAT MR HARRISON WAS A CROAKER,--A MAN WHO HAD SUCCEEDED TO HIS FATHER'S TRADE-MADE FORTUNE WHICH HE HAD FEARED TO LOSE BY ALTERING HIS MODE OF BUSINESS TO ANY HAVING A LARGER SCOPE
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE ARE THE LENNOXES HE HANDSOME FLUENT AND AGREEABLE
AND ALSO INSTIGATED BY HIS OWN INTEREST IN THE CASE OF A CLERGYMAN WHO HAD GIVEN UP HIS LIVING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS THOSE OF MR HALE
I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOU AS A FRIEND
MR HENRY LENNOX PAPA I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA SAID MR HALE
MARGARET I DO BELIEVE THIS IS AN UNHEALTHY PLACE
THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING ABROAD
AS I STAND NOW MY CREDITORS MONEY IS SAFE--EVERY FARTHING OF IT
STILL AS A STATUE
I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE SHUTTING ME OUT ALTOGETHER CHARLOTTE SAID SHE HALF-SMILING
SHE TOOK HER LETTER IN TO HER FATHER AS SOON AS SHE WAS DREST
BUT HE KNOWS THIS NEED,--HE PERCEIVES IT AND THAT IS SOMETHING
I COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR WHAT HE MIGHT ANSWER
I'LL GIVE YOU BACK SAFE AND SOUND BARRING RAILWAY ACCIDENTS AND I'LL INSURE YOUR LIFE FOR A THOUSAND POUNDS BEFORE STARTING WHICH MAY BE SOME COMFORT TO YOUR RELATIONS
IT SEEMED TO HER AT THE MOMENT AS IF THE EARTH WAS MORE UTTERLY DESOLATE THAN IF GIRT IN BY AN IRON DOME BEHIND WHICH THERE MIGHT BE THE INEFFACEABLE PEACE AND GLORY OF THE ALMIGHTY
THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE CHOICE OF SITUATIONS OFFERED TO MR THORNTON
MARGARET FOLLOWED CLOSE
HE KEPT PACING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
SHE WAS COMING HOME WHEN HER FATHER OVERTOOK HER
SHE'S WELL AND AMONG FRIENDS--THANK YOU HIGGINS THAT THANK YOU THAT LINGERED AFTER THE OTHER WORDS AND YET CAME WITH SO MUCH WARMTH OF FEELING LET IN A NEW LIGHT TO THE ACUTE HIGGINS
SHE HUNG ABOUT DIXON FOR A MINUTE OR SO AS IF AFRAID AND IRRESOLUTE
I JUST SAY WHERE'S THE PROOF
ALWAYS DOUBLY TARDY WHEN SHE HAD TO DEGRADE HERSELF BY ANSWERING THE DOOR-BELL
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TEA WI HER FATHER I AM BUT HE SLOUCHED HIS CAP LOW DOWN OVER HIS BROW AS HE WENT OUT INTO THE STREET AND LOOKED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT WHILE HE TRAMPED ALONG BY MARGARET'S SIDE
HAD CAUGHT UP THE HALF-DROPPED WORK AND BEGUN TO PLY HER NEEDLE DILIGENTLY THOUGH THROUGH DIMMED SPECTACLES AND WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND
AND WITHOUT A WORD SHE RAISED HER UP AND SO ARRANGED THE PILLOWS THAT BESSY WAS MORE AT EASE THOUGH VERY LANGUID
DON'T SIT UP ALONE WHAT HIS ANSWER WAS SHE DID NOT HEAR
OTHER LIGHT THAN THAT OF FREDERICK'S PRESENCE SHE HAD NONE
BUT WHO HAS SHE HAD TO TEACH HER WHAT TO DO ABOUT A HOUSE
HE WERE COMING HOME VERY HOPELESS O AUGHT ON EARTH
LET ALONE THE FINE FOR NOT FULFILLING THE CONTRACT
YOUR WIFE WILL BE A DIFFERENT CREATURE TO-MORROW I TRUST
I AGREE WITH MISS HALE SO FAR AS TO CONSIDER OUR PEOPLE IN THE CONDITION OF CHILDREN WHILE I DENY THAT WE THE MASTERS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MAKING OR KEEPING THEM SO
EVEN THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUNERAL SEEMED TO DEVOLVE UPON HER
I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
GREAT LOADED LURRIES BLOCKED UP THE NOT OVER-WIDE THOROUGHFARES
I LOVE HER MORE THAN EVER AND I HATE HER SAID MRS THORNTON IN A LOW FIERCE VOICE
DON'T YOU KNOW THEM I DON'T THINK I DO
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THIS ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG--MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
THAT SHE WOULD KNOW IF ONE IOTA WAS WITHHELD
BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT DIXON AS DO MANY OTHERS LIKED TO FEEL HERSELF RULED BY A POWERFUL AND DECIDED NATURE
HIS MOURNING SUIT SPOKE OF THE REASON THAT HAD CALLED HIM THERE
DID YOU CONSULT THE DOCTOR MARGARET
I AM GOING DOWN TO HELSTONE TO-MORROW TO LOOK AT THE OLD PLACE
BUT MY FATHER'S CHANGE OF OPINION--NAY MARGARET DON'T SIGH MARGARET HAD REASON TO SIGH A LITTLE MORE BEFORE THE CONVERSATION ENDED
MR THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY
I COULD SAY IT FOR MYSELF JOHN BUT NOT FOR YOU
I NEVER LIVED IN A PLACE BEFORE WHERE THERE WERE TWO SETS OF PEOPLE ALWAYS RUNNING EACH OTHER DOWN WHO HAVE YOU HEARD RUNNING THE MASTERS DOWN
THE STREET NOISES HAD BEEN MORE DISTINCT TO HIS INATTENTIVE EAR THAN HER SLOW MOVEMENTS IN HER SOFT MUSLIN GOWN
HE WONDERED MARGARET DID NOT RETURN
WE CANNOT TOUCH THE DISEASE WITH ALL OUR POOR VAUNTED SKILL
IT WAS LEONARDS WAS IT
I'M A POOR BLACK FECKLESS SHEEP--CHILDER MAY CLEM FOR AUGHT I CAN DO UNLESS PARSON YO'D HELP ME HELP YOU
AND WE ON DIVERS SHORES NOW CAST SHALL MEET OUR PERILOUS VOYAGE PAST ALL IN OUR FATHER'S HOUSE AT LAST R
WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER
HE NE'ER SHOWED HIMSEL ABROAD FOR A DAY OR TWO
HANDSOME PONDEROUS WITH NO SIGN OF FEMININE HABITATION EXCEPT IN THE ONE SPOT WHERE HIS MOTHER SATE AND NO CONVENIENCE FOR ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT THAN EATING AND DRINKING
THE LADY STANDING BEFORE HIM SHOWED NO EMOTION NO FLUTTERING FEAR NO ANXIETY NO DESIRE TO END THE INTERVIEW
COME NOW MA'AM SAID DIXON WITH A KIND OF CHEERFUL AUTHORITY YOU KNOW SEEING MASTER FREDERICK IS JUST THE VERY THING OF ALL OTHERS YOU'RE LONGING FOR
BUT AS YOU HAVE EVER BEEN A GOOD--AY
THERE WAS NO SURPRISE NO CURIOSITY
EVEN HE DREW BACK FOR A MOMENT DISMAYED AT THE INTENSITY OF HATRED HE HAD PROVOKED
THEN HER RIGID FACE UNSTIFFENED FROM ITS GRAY FROST-BOUND EXPRESSION AND THE FEATURES DROPPED INTO THE RELAXED LOOK OF DESPONDENCY SO UNUSUAL TO THEIR STERNNESS
IN THE STREETS THERE WERE FEW LOITERERS,--NONE WALKING FOR MERE PLEASURE
THOUGH IT'S ASTONISHING HOW MUCH THOSE THOROUGH-BRED CREATURES CAN DO AND SUFFER
BUT AT LAST SHE TOUCHED THE RIGHT CHORD IN NAMING MRS THORNTON
MAY I BEG YOU TO TAKE A SEAT MR HALE WAS STANDING AT ONE OF THE WINDOWS AS MRS THORNTON SPOKE
HE CANNOT SHAKE THEM OFF ANY MORE THAN THE GREAT ROCK HE RESEMBLES CAN SHAKE OFF PRAY DON'T GO INTO SIMILES MARGARET
WE MUST ROUSE HIM PAPA SAID MARGARET WITH A CRYING VOICE THAT WAS WILD WITH PAIN
THEY WERE SETTLED IN MILTON AND MUST ENDURE SMOKE AND FOGS FOR A SEASON
SOMEWHAT TO MARGARET'S SURPRISE SHE FOUND NICHOLAS ALREADY COME HOME FROM HIS WORK
BUT THE NEXT CONVICTION SHE CAME TO WAS CLEAR ENOUGH;--MR THORNTON HAD SEEN HER CLOSE TO OUTWOOD STATION ON THE FATAL THURSDAY NIGHT AND HAD BEEN TOLD OF HER DENIAL THAT SHE WAS THERE
HE STAGGERED INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND FELT ABOUT FOR A CHAIR
IT HOLDS FAST FOR EVER AND EVER
SHE WENT INTO HER MOTHER'S BED-ROOM JUST BEHIND THE DRAWING-ROOM AND PACED IT UP AND DOWN WHILE AWAITING THE DOCTOR'S COMING OUT
I BELIEVE MISS HALE IS A GUARDIAN TO HERSELF A PRETTY CHARACTER OF YOUR SISTER INDEED
I NEVER CAN DRAW WITH MY BONNET ON
ALL UNCONSCIOUSLY MARGARET DREW NEAR TO A REWARD
AND MASTER THINKING OF TURNING DISSENTER AT HIS TIME OF LIFE WHEN IF IT IS NOT TO BE SAID HE'S DONE WELL IN THE CHURCH HE'S NOT DONE BADLY AFTER ALL
I'LL GO AND TAKE A DISH O TEA WITH HIM SINCE YO'VE ASKED ME
I KNOW I WISH THERE'D BEEN A WHEEL IN OUR PLACE THOUGH DID NOT YOUR FATHER KNOW ABOUT IT ASKED MARGARET
MARGARET TRIED TO CHECK HERSELF BUT WOULD NOT SPEAK UNTIL SHE COULD DO SO WITH FIRMNESS
HE WOULD NOT LET HER SIT UP AND OFFENDED DIXON DESPERATELY BY INSISTING ON WAITING UPON HER HIMSELF
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME I SEE BUT MY NAME IS BELL AND ONCE OR TWICE WHEN THE PARSONAGE HAS BEEN FULL I'VE SLEPT HERE AND TASTED YOUR GOOD ALE TO BE SURE
MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MRS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION WHO ARE THEY THAT HE IS SO ANXIOUS WE SHOULD PAY THEM ALL THIS ATTENTION IT CAME UP LIKE A BURDEN TO A SONG LONG AFTER FANNY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT IN THE PLEASANT EXCITEMENT OF SEEING THE EFFECT OF A NEW BONNET IN THE LOOKING-GLASS
IT JUST GIVES THE RIGHT TOUCH OF COLOUR MA'AM
BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE SAW THAT HE WINCED AWAY FROM ANY REFERENCE TO THE FATHER OF THOSE CHILDREN WHOM HE HAD SO FULLY AND HEARTILY TAKEN UNDER HIS CARE
HE WENT AWAY AS IF WEIGHTS WERE TIED TO EVERY LIMB THAT BORE HIM FROM HER
TO THAT PLACE HER AUNT SHAW AND THE LENNOXES WERE BOUND
I WERE COMING WHOAM TO ASK HER LIKE A BEGGAR AS I AM FOR A BIT O COMFORT I THAT TROUBLE
IT'LL NOT TAKE LONG FOR TO MAKE EM GIVE IN FOR THEY'VE GETTEN A PRETTY LOT OF ORDERS ALL UNDER CONTRACT
THE MOMENT HE HAD DONE SO HE COULD HAVE BITTEN HIS TONGUE OUT
HER FATHER HAD OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCED A DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING THIS SPRING WHICH HAD FOR THE TIME DISTRESSED HIM EXCEEDINGLY
AND I'VE GOT A YOUNG MAN WHO IS PRETTY POSITIVE,--AT LEAST HE WAS AT FIRST;--SINCE HE HAS HEARD OF THE YOUNG LADY'S DENIAL HE SAYS HE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO SWEAR
AND THE MINUTE LAP-DOG IN MRS SHAW'S ARMS BEGAN TO BARK AS IF EXCITED BY THE BURST OF PITY
YOU PROMISED MRS HALE TO BE THAT WOMAN NO SAID MRS THORNTON
WE'RE IN FOR A TURN-OUT MOTHER I HOPE THERE ARE NOT MANY ORDERS IN HAND OF COURSE THERE ARE
DUN YO THINK IT'S FOR MYSEL I'M STRIKING WORK AT THIS TIME
NONE OF THE BUSTLE AND STIR THAT MARGARET HAD NOTICED IN HER TWO JOURNEYS ON THE LONDON AND NORTH-WESTERN LINE
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF CHILD OR YOU'LL BE WANTING THE DOCTOR NEXT BUT HE COULD NOT SETTLE TO ANYTHING THAT EVENING
ALONE SHE WOULD ENDURE HER DISGRACED POSITION IN THE OPINION OF MR THORNTON
A GREAT NUMBER OF FOLK THINKING THEMSELVES VERY GOOD HAVE ODD SORTS OF CONNEXION WITH LIES LEFT-HAND MARRIAGES AND SECOND COUSINS-ONCE-REMOVED
BEST COMFORT NOW WOULD BE THE FEEL OF A CHILD AT HER HEART
SHE FIXED HIM WITH HER EYE
THERE WAS FIRST YOUR WALKING OUT WITH A YOUNG MAN IN THE DARK BUT IT WAS MY BROTHER SAID MARGARET SURPRISED
I NEVER GO TO LONDON
BUT MARGARET--FREDERICK AT THE MENTION OF THAT ONE WORD SHE SUDDENLY CRIED OUT LOUD AS IN SOME SHARP AGONY
THERE WAS A LITTLE BATTLE IN MRS SHAW'S MIND BETWEEN EASE AND A SENSE OF MATRONLY PROPRIETY
AND ONCE WHEN SHE HAD DIMLY HINTED THIS TO EDITH THE LATTER WEARIED WITH DANCING THE NIGHT BEFORE LANGUIDLY STROKED MARGARET'S CHEEK AS SHE SAT BY HER IN THE OLD ATTITUDE,--SHE ON A FOOTSTOOL BY THE SOFA WHERE EDITH LAY
BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN INTO FRANCES STREET THE GIRL STOPPED A MINUTE AND SAID YO'LL NOT FORGET YO'RE TO COME AND SEE US AYE AYE SAID THE FATHER IMPATIENTLY HOO'LL COME
SHE HAD HOWEVER OF LATE SETTLED UPON HER OWN HEALTH AS A SOURCE OF APPREHENSION
BUT FOR FANNY'S SAKE--AS I TOLD MY SON IF FANNY HAD DONE SO WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT A GREAT DISGRACE--AND FANNY MIGHT BE LED AWAY I CAN GIVE YOU NO EXPLANATION SAID MARGARET IN A LOW VOICE
OH MY GOD SAID SHE UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THAT TEARFUL LOOK
I COUNTED A TH CLOCKS IN THE TOWN STRIKING AFORE I'D LEAVE MY WORK
AND I RECKON THEY'LL FIND THAT THEY CANNOT STICK TO IT
MR THORNTON SAID MARGARET A LITTLE SURPRISED
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WAS MOST UNPROPITIOUS TO HEALTH AS WELL AS TO SPIRITS
I REMEMBER ONCE GOING IN A LILAC SILK TO SEE CANDLES MADE AND MY GOWN WAS UTTERLY RUINED VERY PROBABLY SAID MRS THORNTON IN A SHORT DISPLEASED MANNER
THEN HE CAME BACK AND STOOD OPPOSITE TO HER FOR A MOMENT RECEIVING THE GENERAL IMPRESSION OF HER BEAUTIFUL PRESENCE BEFORE HE DARED TO DISTURB IT PERHAPS TO REPEL IT BY WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
THOSE NEVER-ENDING DEPTHS OF SPACE IN THEIR STILL SERENITY WERE MORE MOCKING TO HER THAN ANY MATERIAL BOUNDS COULD BE--SHUTTING IN THE CRIES OF EARTH'S SUFFERERS WHICH NOW MIGHT ASCEND INTO THAT INFINITE SPLENDOUR OF VASTNESS AND BE LOST--LOST FOR EVER BEFORE THEY REACHED HIS THRONE
COME MARGARET GIVE ME A FAREWELL KISS
IT WAS IN THIS WAY SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER OWN JOURNEY TO CAPTAIN LENNOX WHO ASSENTED AS IN DUTY BOUND TO ALL HIS FUTURE MOTHER-IN-LAW SAID WHILE HIS EYES SOUGHT EDITH WHO WAS BUSYING HERSELF IN REARRANGING THE TEA-TABLE AND ORDERING UP ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS IN SPITE OF HIS ASSURANCES THAT HE HAD DINED WITHIN THE LAST TWO HOURS
I SHALL BE SORRY TO BREAK OFF AN ACQUAINTANCE
AND ENDEAVOURED IN VAIN TO ENLIGHTEN THE WOMAN'S MIND
WHEN I'M WITH HER I DON'T KNOW IF I LIKE OR DISLIKE HER MOST
GO AWAY
HE CAME
ALTHOUGH TO THE LAST SHE HOPED THAT SOME FORTUNATE OCCASION WOULD CALL FREDERICK TO PARIS WHITHER SHE COULD EASILY HAVE MET WITH A CONVOY
HE FELT THAT HIS COMPANY GAVE PLEASURE TO MR HALE
I MUST NOT THINK SO MUCH OF HOW CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECT ME MYSELF BUT HOW THEY AFFECT OTHERS IF I WISH TO HAVE A RIGHT JUDGMENT OR A HOPEFUL TRUSTFUL HEART AND WITH A SMILE READY IN HER EYES TO QUIVER DOWN TO HER LIPS SHE WENT INTO THE PARLOUR AND GREETED MR BELL
IT SEEMED AS IF THE THOUGHT OF HIM UPSET ALL HER COMPOSURE DESTROYED THE CALM OVERCAME THE EXHAUSTION
THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO THEY TRIED THE DOOR
THE ATTITUDE WAS ONE OF DESPONDENCY WHATEVER HER FRAME OF MIND MIGHT BE
ALONE
SHE STARTED UP PASSED HER FATHER WHO HAD NEVER MOVED AT THE VEILED DULL SOUND,--RETURNED AND KISSED HIM TENDERLY
HE ADVISED MR HALE TO GO TO BED AND LEAVE ONLY ONE TO WATCH THE SLUMBER WHICH HE HOPED WOULD BE UNDISTURBED
HOUSEHOLDS WERE CHANGED BY ABSENCE OR DEATH OR MARRIAGE OR THE NATURAL MUTATIONS BROUGHT BY DAYS AND MONTHS AND YEARS WHICH CARRY US ON IMPERCEPTIBLY FROM CHILDHOOD TO YOUTH AND THENCE THROUGH MANHOOD TO AGE WHENCE WE DROP LIKE FRUIT FULLY RIPE INTO THE QUIET MOTHER EARTH
BUT ALTHOUGH SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE FELT SHOCKED OR GRIEVED OR INDIGNANT AT HIS FALLING OFF IN THE ABSTRACT AS SOON AS THEY SAW THE FACE OF THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD ONCE LOVED THEY FORGOT HIS OPINIONS IN HIMSELF
SHE TOOK HER TO HER HEART AS A CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND--THE POST MARGARET HAD ALWAYS LONGED TO FILL AND HAD ENVIED DIXON FOR BEING PREFERRED TO
THANK YOU PAPA
BUT HE WERE NOT MADE OF IRON HIMSEL HE'D HA CRIED OUT FOR HIS OWN SORROWS NEXT
A DARK SILK GOWN WITHOUT ANY TRIMMING OR FLOUNCE
SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AWKWARD FOR BOTH TO BE BROUGHT INTO CONSCIOUS COLLISION
NAY WENCH WHATEVER HOO SAID HOO CAN KNOW NOUGHT ABOUT IT NOW AND I MUN HA A SUP O DRINK JUST TO STEADY ME AGAIN SORROW NO SAID MARGARET SOFTENING WITH HIS SOFTENED MANNER
HE ONLY STAYED TO PRESENT HIS PEACHES--TO SPEAK SOME GENTLE KINDLY WORDS--AND THEN HIS COLD OFFENDED EYES MET MARGARET'S WITH A GRAVE FAREWELL AS HE LEFT THE ROOM
AND WHEN THEY CEASED MRS HALE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
IT IS HARD AND SAD
HE'S LIKE A CAT,--AS SLEEK AND CUNNING AND FIERCE
I HAD A COUSIN MISS WHO TURNED METHODIST PREACHER AFTER HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND A TAILOR ALL HIS LIFE
THERE IS TO BE NO FURTHER ENQUIRY I BELIEVE I'VE GOT MR THORNTON'S NOTE ABOUT ME SAID THE INSPECTOR FUMBLING IN HIS POCKET-BOOK
HER MOTHER WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO THROW OUT TERRIBLE POSSIBILITIES MISERABLE PROBABILITIES UNFORTUNATE CHANCES OF ALL KINDS AS A ROCKET THROWS OUT SPARKS
I WAS THINKING OF HIM TOO THEY KNOCKED
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HOPE AND EXPECT ALL THESE LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH MARGARET WILL END IN NO I DON'T SAID HE REDDENING
YET THERE WAS THE CONSTANT DRAIN OF EXPENSES FOR WORKING THE BUSINESS
HE COULD NOT ATTEND TO ALL THE LAWYER'S DETAILS WHICH AS HE SAW MADE MARGARET'S EYES DILATE AND HER LIPS GROW PALE AS ONE BY ONE FATE DECREED OR SO IT SEEMED EVERY MORSEL OF EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD EXONERATE FREDERICK SHOULD FALL FROM BENEATH HER FEET AND DISAPPEAR
MILTON IS NOT THE PLACE FOR COWARDS
AND FATHER WAS AFEARD OF LETTING ME GO TO A STRANGE PLACE FOR THOUGH YO WOULD NA THINK IT NOW MANY A ONE THEN USED TO CALL ME A GRADELY LASS ENOUGH
I THINK YOU HAVE MADE THE TINTS ON THE THATCH TOO DARK HAVE YOU NOT AS HE RETURNED MARGARET'S TO HER AND HELD OUT HIS HAND FOR MR LENNOX'S WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM ONE MOMENT NO MORE
WHAT IT WAS MARGARET COULD NOT SEE
ONLY ONCE,--I DON'T WANT TO BE TROUBLESOME I WILL DO ANYTHING IF YOU WISH IT MAMMA,--BUT IF--BUT WHEN FREDERICK COMES AH TO BE SURE
POSSESSED BY ILL-HUMOUR AT BEING DETAINED SO LONG FROM HER
WE FIXED THAT BECAUSE OF MR BELL AND DIXON'S DISAGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE YES
AND AFTER KEEPING HIM WAITING FOR NEARLY AN HOUR MARGARET CAME IN LOOKING VERY WHITE AND ANXIOUS
AND A STEADY LIKELY SET O PEOPLE
TWO O'CLOCK CAME
I LIKE TO SEE A GIRL FLY OUT AT THE NOTION OF BEING TALKED ABOUT
THE BREADTH OF ONE OF YOUR FINGERS DOES NOT GIVE ME A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF DISTANCE WELL THEN I SUPPOSE IT IS THIRTY MILES
YOU WANT YOUR BREAKFAST I'M SURE
HE CRIED SO VIOLENTLY WHEN SHUT UP ALONE IN HIS LITTLE ROOM AT NIGHT THAT MARGARET AND DIXON CAME DOWN IN AFFRIGHT TO WARN HIM TO BE QUIET
HE LOVED HER SWEET BEAUTY
THOUGH BESSY'S EYES WERE SHUT SHE WAS LISTENING FOR SOME TIME FOR THE MOISTURE OF TEARS GATHERED HEAVY ON HER EYELASHES
I AM GLAD
SAYS HE MISS DIXON
SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST BE ALONE BEFORE SHE COULD OPEN THAT LETTER
MR BELL WOULD HAVE HAD IT KEEP STILL AT EXCHANGING WILD-BEAST SKINS FOR ACORNS NO NO
PAY FOR THAT OUT OF YOUR TEN SHILLINGS AND KEEP THOSE POOR CHILDREN IF YOU CAN
MRS SHAW AND HER MAID FOUND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION IN RESTORING MARGARET'S WARDROBE TO A STATE OF ELEGANT VARIETY
A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN MY MISERY OF DOUBT BECAME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING I WROTE TO MR BELL--YOU REMEMBER MR BELL MARGARET NO
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MAKE ME SO MORBID TO-DAY
MRS THORNTON SAW THE BATTLE-SPIRIT IN MARGARET'S EYES AND IT CALLED UP HER COMBATIVENESS ALSO
BUT IT WAS OF A PIECE WITH HER HELPLESS CHARACTER TO FEEL HIS LOSS AS PRINCIPALLY AFFECTING HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN
THEY PAY ME RENT FOR THE OVEN AND COOKING-PLACES AT THE BACK OF THE MILL
A MAN'S TALL FIGURE STOOD BETWEEN HER AND THE LUMINOUS STREET
THIS SELF-REPROACH FOR HAVING SAID WHAT HAD AT THE TIME APPEARED TO BE WISE BUT WHICH AFTER EVENTS WERE PROVING TO HAVE BEEN SO FOOLISH
SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK IN ANSWER TO SUCH ACCUSATIONS
IF IT WERE NOT I SHOULD CALL IT TURNING THINGS UPSIDE DOWN FOR VERY LITTLE PURPOSE
I DON'T KNOW--THE WEATHER I THINK
AND YOU BELONG TO THE UNION
WHAT A CHANGE IT WILL BE TO HER FROM MILTON
IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MRS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
THIS IS YOUR LAST DINNER-PARTY IS IT NOT
EVEN TO TRY TO SAVE
IF I HAD KNOWN HOW DARK IT WOULD BE WE WOULDN'T HAVE SENT BACK THE CAB MARGARET OH DON'T FIDGET ABOUT THAT
AT LEAST THAT IS MY OPINION THIS LAST CLAUSE SHE GAVE OUT WITH THE PRIDE THAT APES HUMILITY BUT SURELY IF THE MIND IS TOO LONG DIRECTED TO ONE OBJECT ONLY IT WILL GET STIFF AND RIGID AND UNABLE TO TAKE IN MANY INTERESTS SAID MARGARET
WHY DUNNO YO SPEAK
IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT HER FATHER EXPECTED TO SEE HIM AND WAS SURPRISED THAT HE DID NOT COME
HE WAS NOT GOING TO MILTON
MR BELL CAME UP TO WISH HER GOOD-BYE
WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
MR BELL'S WHOLE MANNER CHANGED
OH IT WAS CRUEL OF YOU NO SIR IT WAS NOT CRUEL REPLIED DR DONALDSON WITH QUICK DECISION
AND NOW WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF
SHE WANTS TO SEE IT
I KNOW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOU ARE AWARE OF
AND YET WHEN THAT DUTY IS ALL DONE BY OTHERS WHO SO READY TO CRY FIE FOR SHAME AND ALL THIS TIME I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
BUT YOU ARE A FRIEND AND I EXPECT YOU WILL PAY MY EXPERIMENT THE RESPECT OF SILENCE
I AM BETTER NOW SAID SHE IN A VERY LOW FAINT VOICE
SHE TOOK IN HIS APPEARANCE AND LIKED IT
BUT MR LENNOX SAYS THINGS ARE SURE TO BRIGHTEN MR LENNOX KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT IT SAID MR THORNTON QUIETLY
SHE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND STIRRED UP THE FIRE AND LIGHTED THE HOUSE AND PREPARED FOR THE WANDERER'S REFRESHMENT
I ONLY SAID VERY FAR FROM WELL
THE DOOR OF THE INN STOOD WIDE OPEN BUT THERE WAS NO HOSPITABLE HURRY TO RECEIVE THE TRAVELLERS
BUT MARGARET HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL THE LAST FEW DAYS WHEN THE PROSPECT OF SOON LOSING HER COMPANION SEEMED TO GIVE FORCE TO EVERY SWEET QUALITY AND CHARM WHICH EDITH POSSESSED
THEY TALKED ABOUT ART IN A MERELY SENSUOUS WAY DWELLING ON OUTSIDE EFFECTS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEMSELVES TO LEARN WHAT IT HAS TO TEACH
MARY DOMVILLE'S LITTLE CRIPPLED BOY WOULD CRAWL IN VAIN TO THE DOOR AND LOOK FOR HER COMING THROUGH THE FOREST
WHEN SHE HAD LEFT THE ROOM HE BEGAN IN HIS SCRUTINISING WAY TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
AFORE HAMPER AND ME HAD THIS SPLIT TH OVERLOOKER TELLED HIM I WERE STIRRING UP THE MEN TO ASK FOR HIGHER WAGES
YOU'RE VERY FEVERISH
I NEVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING OF THAT KIND SAID MARGARET REDDENING AND LOOKING HURT AND OFFENDED
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT YES SAID MARGARET MORE THAN ONCE
BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
AND AFTER YESTERDAY TOO
SPRING NOR SUMMER WILL DO ME GOOD SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY
CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK
BUT HE HAD NOT HIS ACCUSTOMED PIPE
PUNISHMENT AND SUFFERING WERE THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCES TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN THE RIOT
DO YOU KNOW I'M REALLY AFRAID MRS HALE IS VERY FAR FROM WELL FROM WHAT DR DONALDSON SAYS IT'S STRANGE OF THEM TO ACCEPT A DINNER-INVITATION IF SHE'S VERY ILL SAID FANNY
THEN MARGARET ROSE FROM HER TREMBLING AND DESPONDENCY AND BECAME AS A STRONG ANGEL OF COMFORT TO HER FATHER AND BROTHER
HER ROUND TAPER FINGERS FLEW IN AND OUT OF HER SEWING AS STEADILY AND SWIFTLY AS IF THAT WERE THE BUSINESS OF HER LIFE
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IT IS SAID SHE
THANK YO THERE'S MANY ON EM GETS NO MORE AND IS NOT SO BAD OFF,--LEASTWAYS DOES NOT SHOW IT AS HE DOES
I WAS SO FULL OF SHOLTO
BUT IF NOT YOU WILL BE SAFER THERE THAN HERE
I'M MADE OF IRON
SHE TRIED HERSELF IN IMAGINATION WITH HER AUNT SHAW AND EDITH
SHE WAS A LIAR
THE VICAR ABOVE ALL
HE WAS GLAD SHE DID NOT AND YET HE WAS IRRITATED AT HER FOR NOT DOING IT
BUT THE TRUTH IS THEY WANT TO BE MASTERS AND MAKE THE MASTERS INTO SLAVES ON THEIR OWN GROUND
RATHER ATTRACTED AND INTERESTED
MR LENNOX WAS PUSHING ON IN HIS PROFESSION
NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN
IT'S A LONG TIME FOR A MAN TO WAIT DOING NOTHING BUT FIRST HOPING AND THEN FEARING CHAPTER XXXIX MAKING FRIENDS NAY I HAVE DONE
SO I'VE BEEN AND TOLD HIM THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE FOR MASTER FREDERICK TO BE HERE
WON'T THAT DO I DARE SAY IT WILL
HE COULD NOT SEE IT ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CANDLES BROUGHT IN THE SUDDEN AFFRIGHT WERE BURNING AND FLARING THERE
YOUR MOTHER IS NOT VERY WELL AND THINKS SHE CANNOT WALK SO FAR
AND IN HIS WIFE'S PRESENT STATE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN EXPECT HIM TO REMAIN AWAY LONGER THAN FRIDAY
SHE SATE WITH HIS HAND IN HERS
HER MOUTH WAS WIDE
MR BELL SOMEHOW THAT FALL KILLED HIM HOW AWKWARD
BUT I AM AFRAID I SHOULD BE A COWARD SOUTH COUNTRY PEOPLE ARE OFTEN FRIGHTENED BY WHAT OUR DARKSHIRE MEN AND WOMEN ONLY CALL LIVING AND STRUGGLING
I CAN NOBBUT SAY BLESS YO
HER FATHER SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THEY HAD ANY REASON TO EXPECT A LETTER FROM FREDERICK THAT MORNING
IT WAS AN EVENT TO DIVERSIFY THE MONOTONY OF THE INVALID'S LIFE
AND THE VIEW OF THE PLAIN IN THE VALLEY MADE BY THE SWEEPING BEND OF THE RIVER WAS ALL SHUT OUT WHEN MRS HALE ARRIVED AT HER NEW HOME
ALL HOUSEHOLD PLENTY AND COMFORT ALL PURPLE AND FINE LINEN HONOUR LOVE OBEDIENCE TROOPS OF FRIENDS WOULD ALL COME AS NATURALLY AS JEWELS ON A KING'S ROBE AND BE AS LITTLE THOUGHT OF FOR THEIR SEPARATE VALUE
I'M NONE SO FOND OF HAVING STRANGE FOLK IN MY HOUSE BUT THEN RELENTING AS HE SAW HER HEIGHTENED COLOUR HE ADDED YO'RE A FOREIGNER AS ONE MAY SAY AND MAYBE DON'T KNOW MANY FOLK HERE AND YO'VE GIVEN MY WENCH HERE FLOWERS OUT OF YO'R OWN HAND;--YO MAY COME IF YO LIKE MARGARET WAS HALF-AMUSED HALF-NETTLED AT THIS ANSWER
MARGARET DID YOU KNOW OF THIS
HE KNEW HOW MUCH HE HAD TO DO--MORE THAN HIS USUAL WORK OWING TO THE COMMOTION OF THE DAY BEFORE
HERE HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED MARGARET'S LITTLE LOOK OF ENTREATY AS SHE URGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AND HE ALSO RECOLLECTED A FEW HINTS GIVEN HIM LONG AGO BY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MR LENNOX'S AS TO HIS ADMIRATION OF MARGARET
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW NOW IF I MAY--IF IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU TOO MUCH PAIN TO SPEAK ABOUT IT PAIN
HE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED
IT WOULD BE OF NO USE NOW
WHEN SHE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN SHE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE BED-ROOM
AND MARGARET MOVED STIFFLY AND SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE PLACE IN THE HALL WHERE SHE HAD BEEN STANDING SO LONG OUT THROUGH THE BARE ECHOING DRAWING-ROOM INTO THE TWILIGHT OF AN EARLY NOVEMBER EVENING
OR IF THEY FORCED THEMSELVES UPON HER ATTENTION IT WAS SIMPLY AS CAUSES FOR GRATITUDE TO HER AUNT WHO WAS PUTTING HERSELF SO MUCH OUT OF HER WAY TO THINK OF HER
BECAUSE I KNOW NO ONE THERE AND NO ONE KNOWS HELSTONE OR CAN EVER TALK TO ME ABOUT IT BREAD FOR YOUR FAMILY
HE DID NOT FIND BOUCHER AT HOME BUT HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH HIS WIFE
BUT IF SHE HAD INTENDED IT SHE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT MORE THOROUGHLY
GOD HAS SEEN FIT TO BE VERY HARD ON YOU VERY SHE SHOOK WITH THE SOBS THAT COME SO CONVULSIVELY WHEN AN OLD PERSON WEEPS
MARGARET WAS READY LONG BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME AND HAD LEISURE ENOUGH TO CRY A LITTLE QUIETLY WHEN UNOBSERVED AND TO SMILE BRIGHTLY WHEN ANY ONE LOOKED AT HER
BUT MARGARET WAS NOT PREPARED FOR IT
HIS PALE HAGGARD FACE STRUCK HER PAINFULLY
THAT HE HAD NEVER GOT ACQUAINTED WITH THEM
AND THEN HE MADE AN UNSATISFACTORY COMPROMISE
THEY WERE TO STOP IN LONDON ALL NIGHT AT SOME QUIET HOTEL
PRAY SEE AFTER THAT GIRL MRS THORNTON NAMED
I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
AND HE REPLIED NOT IF YOU'VE ANY SENSE IN YOU MY LITTLE SISTER SO I SUPPOSE HE IS ABLE TO SOUND HIS H'S WHICH IS NOT A COMMON DARKSHIRE ACCOMPLISHMENT--EH MARGARET MR LENNOX DID NOT SAY WHY MR THORNTON WAS COME UP TO TOWN
AY AY
BUT YOU SEE I WAS TAKEN UP WITH MISS HALE
WHY EVEN MY FATHER THINKS A DEAL O DREAMS
A SENSE OF CHANGE OF INDIVIDUAL NOTHINGNESS OF PERPLEXITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT OVER-POWERED MARGARET
MOTHER--MOTHER CRIED HE
THEY THINK TRADE IS FLOURISHING AS IT WAS LAST YEAR
OH TAKE SUMMUT BETTER
ROUSED DISCIPLINE ALOUD PROCLAIMS THEIR CAUSE AND INJURED NAVIES URGE THEIR BROKEN LAWS BYRON
THAT QUICK MOMENTARY SYMPATHY WOULD BE THEIRS NO LONGER IF HE WENT AWAY
NOT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE KNOWN HOW SHE WOULD HAVE SUFFERED,--THAT I WOULD UNDO IT--THE ACT OF OPEN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT I NO LONGER HELD THE SAME FAITH AS THE CHURCH IN WHICH I WAS A PRIEST
I'LL DO HER THAT JUSTICE
THEY SET OUT ON THEIR HOUSE-HUNTING
BOTH LESS LOSS OF TIME WHERE TEARS HAD TO BE WAITED FOR AND A BETTER EFFECT AT LAST IF MARGARET THOUGHT FREDERICK'S THEORY RATHER A ROUGH ONE AT FIRST SHE SAW HOW HE WORKED IT OUT INTO CONTINUAL PRODUCTION OF KINDNESS IN FACT
WHY MY PARAGON PUPIL AS MARGARET CALLS HIM HAS TOLD ME THAT HIS MOTHER INTENDS TO CALL ON MRS AND MISS HALE TO-MORROW MRS THORNTON EXCLAIMED MRS HALE
AND THAT IN THE WANING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MASTERS AS WELL AS OF MEN MUST GO DOWN INTO RUIN AND BE NO MORE SEEN AMONG THE RANKS OF THE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS
IT IS THE TOWN LIFE SAID SHE
I REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
NOT AT WHAT YOU CALL WORK
A RECITAL TOO THE MANNER OF WHICH BETRAYED SUCH UTTER WANT OF IMAGINATION AND THEREFORE OF ANY SYMPATHY WITH THE SUFFERING ANIMAL
AND WHAT HE DID SAY WAS A LITTLE FORMAL
HIS CAUSE FOR CONTEMPT WAS SO JUST THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE RESPECTED HIM LESS IF SHE HAD THOUGHT HE DID NOT FEEL CONTEMPT
NOT BUT WHAT I HAVE TOLD A PRETTY ROUND NUMBER IN MY LIFE NOT ALL IN DOWNRIGHT WORDS AS I SUPPOSE YOU DID BUT IN ACTIONS OR IN SOME SHABBY CIRCUMLOCUTORY WAY LEADING PEOPLE EITHER TO DISBELIEVE THE TRUTH OR BELIEVE A FALSEHOOD
ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
THE REMARK WAS MORE IN CHARACTER WITH HER FATHER THAN WITH HER USUAL SELF
A MAN IS TO ME A HIGHER AND A COMPLETER BEING THAN A GENTLEMAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED MARGARET
HE WOULD SOONER CONSENT TO BE ONLY A MANAGER WHERE HE COULD HAVE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF POWER BEYOND THE MERE MONEY-GETTING PART THAN HAVE TO FALL IN WITH THE TYRANNICAL HUMOURS OF A MONEYED PARTNER WITH WHOM HE FELT SURE THAT HE SHOULD QUARREL IN A FEW MONTHS
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE BUT IT WAS NOT CRUEL
IT WAS TO TELL OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT CORFU
I NE'ER THANKED YO'R DAUGHTER THEER FOR HER DEEDS O LOVE TO MY POOR WENCH
THINGS AS CAN BE FELT AND TOUCHED
SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE NOR HAD HE HEARD HER RISE
THIS INDIGNATION WAS TEMPERED IN SOME DEGREE BY CONTEMPT FOR THEM IRISHERS AND BY PLEASURE AT THE IDEA OF THE BUNGLING WAY IN WHICH THEY WOULD SET TO WORK AND PERPLEX THEIR NEW MASTERS WITH THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY STRANGE EXAGGERATED STORIES OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SPREADING THROUGH THE TOWN
SEALED IT UP HURRIEDLY FOR FEAR HER MOTHER SHOULD ASK TO SEE IT
HER FRIENDS CONTRIBUTED THE BEAUTY CAPTAIN LENNOX THE EASY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECTS OF THE DAY
WE JUST TAKE OUR HANDS FRO OUR LOOMS AND SAY YO MAY CLEM US BUT YO'LL NOT PUT UPON US MY MASTERS AND BE DANGED TO EM THEY SHAN'T THIS TIME I WISH I LIVED DOWN SOUTH SAID BESSY
PARSON
SHE DISAPPOINTED HIM BY THE QUIET WAY IN WHICH SHE ASKED WHAT SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE MERELY NECESSARY QUESTIONS RESPECTING HER OLD ACQUAINTANCES IN MILTON
I'LL BIDE INSIDE THESE FOUR WALLS AND SHE'LL BIDE OUT
YOUR MONEY WOULD HAVE GONE THERE TOO IF YOU'D BEEN SUCH A FOOL AS TO LEND IT CATCH ME
AND THEN MAYBE YO'D HA SPOKEN OF HER MORE CIVIL THAN YO DID
BUT WHAT GULLS MEN ARE THERE WAS A PAUSE
LOOK
HE WERE A SOUTHAMPTON MAN IN A STRANGE PLACE OR ELSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO READY TO CALL COUSINS WITH HIM A NASTY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING FELLOW
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME
ONE WOULD THINK YOU WERE MADE OF MONEY NOT QUITE YET
OH THERE'S HARRISON'S WHERE I BOUGHT SO MANY OF MY WEDDING-THINGS
SOME OF THOSE MARKED G
IT WAS THE WILFUL BAD MANNERS ARISING FROM DEEP OFFENCE
SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FIT FOR IT SHE SAID SHE WAS
MR THORNTON CAME FRANKLY FORWARDS
IT APPEARED TO MR THORNTON THAT ALL THESE GRACEFUL CARES WERE HABITUAL TO THE FAMILY
NOW HIS SIGHT WAS DIM HIS SENSES WAVERING HIS WALK TOTTERING AS IF HE WERE SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
MARGARET SAID MR HALE AT LAST IN A SORT OF SUDDEN DESPERATE WAY THAT MADE HER START
I WENT AND HEARD SOME KIND OF A RAMBLING STATEMENT WHICH THE CLERK SAID WAS OF NO GREAT USE
SHE WAS THANKFUL TO SEE HER FATHER SO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HER MOTHER AS NOT TO NOTICE HER LOOKS
EDITH IS ASLEEP AUNT SHAW
THE LITTLE SQUARE MATTED HALL WAS EQUALLY FILLED WITH SIGNS OF MERRY HEALTHY ROUGH CHILDHOOD
THEN THE NEIGHBOUR WOMAN SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK MRS BOUCHER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS ON HER LAP
FOR SOME DAYS HER SPIRITS VARIED STRANGELY
AND BLESS YO'!--AND AMEN CHAPTER XLIV EASE NOT PEACE A DULL ROTATION NEVER AT A STAY YESTERDAY'S FACE TWIN IMAGE OF TO-DAY COWPER
ONLY WE NEED NOT WALK AT A SNAIL'S PACE VERY WELL
CAN YOU REST THERE HE ASKED
IT ALWAYS WAS
MRS THORNTON LIFTED HER UP WITH A STRENGTH THAT WAS AS MUCH THAT OF THE WILL AS OF THE BODY AND CARRIED HER AWAY
HE HAD A QUICK EYE AT DISCERNING CHARACTER AND WAS STRUCK BY A REMARK WHICH MR THORNTON MADE AT DINNER-TIME
REMEMBER I AM A MILTON MAN
SHE OUGHT TO SEE HIM IF SHE WISHES IT SO MUCH FOR I BELIEVE IT WOULD DO HER MUCH MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE DOCTOR'S MEDICINE,--AND PERHAPS SET HER UP ALTOGETHER
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN A GOOD DEAL TO OVERCOME HER PRIDE
HER GRAVE SWEET EYES MET HIS
THERE WERE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ON BOTH SIDES--THE LATEST INTELLIGENCE WHICH EACH COULD GIVE OF MRS SHAW'S MOVEMENTS IN ITALY TO BE EXCHANGED
IN A FORTNIGHT NO--NO NOT EXACTLY TO A DAY
DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF MY DEAR
I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU CARED FOR ME IN THAT WAY
AND WE SHA'N'T SEE HER NO MORE MEASTER SAID I IF I DUNNOT SEE HER AFORE HOO GOES I'LL STRIVE TO GET UP TO LUNNUN NEXT WHISSUNTIDE THAT I WILL
I THINK THAT MUST BE ONE OF EDITH'S EXAGGERATIONS
BUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THIS LETTER TILL LONG LONG AFTER WE HEARD OF THE MUTINY
WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE IT OR DISLIKE IT
YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO STOP IN THIS HOUSE SHE ASKED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND GO ON BATHING MISS HALE'S FOREHEAD SHALL YOU
SHE WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE--SHE WOULD HAVE PERJURED HERSELF TO SAVE FREDERICK RATHER--FAR RATHER--THAN MR THORNTON SHOULD HAVE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE THAT PROMPTED HIM TO INTERFERE TO SAVE HER
FREDERICK SHOOK IT OFF FIRST
AND SHE WAS RATHER CONFIRMED IN THIS IDEA BY THE EVIDENT ANXIETY BESSY SHOWED TO HASTEN HER DEPARTURE
BUT SHE WAS NOT UNGRATEFUL
MY MEASTER HIM AT TH SHOP YONDER IS SPINNING ABOUT TH WORLD SOMEWHERE IS THAT THE REASON YOU'RE SO SOON AT HOME TO-NIGHT ASKED MARGARET INNOCENTLY
OUR BUTLER'S WIFE LIVES IN A BETTER HOUSE THAN THIS IT IS SOMETIMES VERY PRETTY--IN SUMMER
I NEVER WAS AT OXENHAM WERE NOT YOU
IF JOHN AND YOU HAD COME TOGETHER HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO KEEP A TIGHT HAND OVER YOU TO MAKE YOU KNOW YOUR PLACE
SHE IS VERY SLACK OF WORK AND IS A GOOD GIRL AND WOULD TAKE PAINS TO DO HER BEST I AM SURE AND WOULD SLEEP AT HOME AND NEED NEVER COME UPSTAIRS SO AS TO KNOW WHO IS IN THE HOUSE AS YOU PLEASE
DO YOU THINK SUCH LIFE AS THIS IS WORTH CARING FOR GASPED BESSY AT LAST
WHERE IS HE
SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK TILL SHE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MASTERING HER VOICE AND THEN SHE SAID
THE NIGHT WAS FINE THE STREETS CLEAN AND WITH HER PRETTY WHITE SILK LIKE LEEZIE LINDSAY'S GOWN O GREEN SATIN IN THE BALLAD KILTED UP TO HER KNEE SHE WAS OFF WITH HER FATHER--READY TO DANCE ALONG WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF THE COOL FRESH NIGHT AIR
I'D NEVER SAY A WORD AGAINST IT IF IT COULD DO THE GIRL ANY GOOD
EMPLOYING HIS EVENINGS IN A CONTINUAL PACE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WHICH WOULD HAVE ANNOYED HIS MOTHER EXCEEDINGLY IF IT HAD BEEN PRACTISED BY ANY ONE ELSE
IT'S A GREAT POWER
POOR WOMEN GO AND DON'T CARE IF THEY ARE SEEN OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF
HE BURIED HIS HEAD IN HIS ARMS WHICH LAY FOLDED ON THE TABLE
IT WAS WELL THAT THE LONG WALK IN THE OPEN AIR WOUND UP THIS EVENING FOR HIM
DON'T LET THE SOLDIERS COME IN AND CUT DOWN POOR-CREATURES WHO ARE DRIVEN MAD
IT IS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE THE REACTION AFTER THE POWERFUL OPIATES I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO USE
I WOULD RATHER BE A MAN TOILING SUFFERING--NAY FAILING AND SUCCESSLESS--HERE THAN LEAD A DULL PROSPEROUS LIFE IN THE OLD WORN GROOVES OF WHAT YOU CALL MORE ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY DOWN IN THE SOUTH WITH THEIR SLOW DAYS OF CARELESS EASE
ALTHOUGH HE HATED MARGARET AT TIMES WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THAT GENTLE FAMILIAR ATTITUDE AND ALL THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD A RESTLESS DESIRE TO RENEW HER PICTURE IN HIS MIND--A LONGING FOR THE VERY ATMOSPHERE SHE BREATHED
SEND FOR THE DOCTOR TO-MORROW FOR YOURSELF
AT ANY RATE JOHN MUST BE SATISFIED NOW CHAPTER XIII A SOFT BREEZE IN A SULTRY PLACE THAT DOUBT AND TROUBLE FEAR AND PAIN AND ANGUISH ALL ARE SHADOWS VAIN THAT DEATH ITSELF SHALL NOT REMAIN
IT WAS NOW AUGUST AND THERE HAD BEEN NO MENTION OF THE SPANISH JOURNEY TO WHICH HE HAD ALLUDED TO EDITH AND MARGARET TRIED TO RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE FADING AWAY OF THIS ILLUSION
HE WANTED TO SEE HER ABOUT A PLAN WHICH HE HAD IN HIS HEAD
IF USING LOCAL WORDS IS VULGAR I WAS VERY VULGAR IN THE FOREST,--WAS I NOT MAMMA IT WAS UNUSUAL WITH MARGARET TO OBTRUDE HER OWN SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION ON OTHERS
ANYTHING RATHER THAN HAVE THAT CHILD BROUGHT UP IN SUCH PRACTICAL PAGANISM OH
YET AS HE DID NOT SPEAK SHE DID NOT LIKE TO VOLUNTEER ANY ATTEMPT AT COMFORT
HE GIVES LESSONS
I BELIEVE THE MASTERS HAVE A THING OR TWO IN THEIR HEADS WHICH WILL TEACH THE MEN NOT TO STRIKE AGAIN IN A HURRY IF THEY TRY IT THIS TIME DOES IT NOT MAKE THE TOWN VERY ROUGH ASKED MARGARET
AND WHEN SHE SPOKE HER VOICE SEEMED UNUSUAL AND CONSTRAINED
SHE KNEW THAT MISS HALE WAS APT TO CALL ALL PEOPLE THAT SHE LIKED OLD AS A SORT OF TERM OF ENDEARMENT
AND INDEED THEY DID
IT WAS ONLY THEIR VIOLENCE THAT WAS CLEAR
WHAT DO YOU KNOW HE DID NOT REPLY TO HER
AND JUST WALK IT FORWARD LIKE A BLACK BUG-A-BOO TO FRIGHTEN NAUGHTY CHILDREN WITH INTO BEING GOOD
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO SHOW HERSELF OUT
HE IS VERY QUIET--HE IS NOT TIPSY AT ALL
IT WAS GOOD OF HIM TO BRING IT
I HAD HEARD A RING AT THE FRONT DOOR BUT I THOUGHT THE RINGER MUST HAVE DONE HIS BUSINESS AND GONE AWAY LONG AGO
HE LOVED THIS BABBY MAPPEN THE BEST ON US
NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION
HOW DIFFERENT MEN WERE TO WOMEN
MARGARET SATE WITH HER FATHER IN THE ROOM WITH THE DEAD
HOWEVER IT WAS ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH MRS THORNTON'S EXPRESSED DESIRE THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT WANT IN THE PROGRESS OF HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS
WE ARE STUNG WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF A THOUSAND SLIGHTED OPPORTUNITIES OF FULFILLING THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO WILL SOON PASS AWAY FROM AMONG US
SHE STOOD UP,--SHE TOTTERED
JUST THE AGE THAT EDITH WAS WHEN SHE WAS ENGAGED TO CAPTAIN LENNOX
INSTEAD SHE WOULD GO AND SEE BESSY HIGGINS
SHE COULD NOT ENTER INTO THE ENDURING MERCY OF THE GOD WHO HAD NOT SPECIALLY INTERPOSED TO PREVENT THE WATER FROM DROWNING HER PROSTRATE HUSBAND
PULLING HIS WEARY HEAD UP IN FACT WITH HER GENTLE VIOLENCE TILL IT RESTED IN HER ARMS AND SHE COULD LOOK INTO HIS EYES AND LET THEM GAIN STRENGTH AND ASSURANCE FROM HERS
FOR MONTHS PAST ALL HER OWN PERSONAL CARES AND TROUBLES HAD HAD TO BE STUFFED AWAY INTO A DARK CUPBOARD
HE ROSE AND WALKED NERVOUSLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
I KNEW THAT COULD NEVER BE
WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE
BUT THE BONES WERE WELL PUT TOGETHER AND THAT GIVES IMMENSE POWER
AND IF IT GIVES HIM A SHOCK AT FIRST IT WILL MAYBE BE THE BETTER AFTERWARDS
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD DO ANY GOOD
BUT I DON'T FEEL QUITE SO SURE AS YOU DO OF THE EXISTENCE OF THOSE FEELINGS
HE SAID THIS MORE EXPRESSLY AND PARTICULARLY ON THE VERY DAY BEFORE MRS THORNTON'S DINNER-PARTY WHEN MARGARET GOING IN TO SPEAK TO BESSY FOUND HIM ARGUING THE POINT WITH BOUCHER THE NEIGHBOUR OF WHOM SHE HAD FREQUENTLY HEARD MENTION AS BY TURNS EXCITING HIGGINS'S COMPASSION AS AN UNSKILFUL WORKMAN WITH A LARGE FAMILY DEPENDING UPON HIM FOR SUPPORT AND AT OTHER TIMES ENRAGING HIS MORE ENERGETIC AND SANGUINE NEIGHBOUR BY HIS WANT OF WHAT THE LATTER CALLED SPIRIT
WORST THEY COULD SAY OF ME IS THAT I DID WHAT I THOUGHT BEST EVEN TO MY OWN WRONG YOU'D BETTER GO AND TRY THEM THEN AND SEE WHETHER THEY'LL GIVE YOU WORK
SHE'S PAID FOR IT DEARLY IF SHE DID
BUT THERE THE HEAVY LUMBERING VEHICLES SEEMED VARIOUS IN THEIR PURPOSES AND INTENT
IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THORNTON HIMSELF THOUGH SHE WAS HIS SISTER
YOU MIGHT HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM CHAMBERS IN THE TEMPLE INSTEAD OF HAVING BEEN TWO MONTHS IN THE HIGHLANDS
MR BELL TOOK HIS LEAVE THE NEXT DAY BIDDING MARGARET LOOK TO HIM AS ONE WHO HAD A RIGHT TO HELP AND PROTECT HER IN ALL HER TROUBLES OF WHATEVER NATURE THEY MIGHT BE
ALL SHE COULD DO WAS TO HOPE HER AUNT WOULD BE INDISPOSED TO GET OUT OF THE COACH AND WALK UP THE COURT AND AT EVERY BREATH OF WIND HAVE HER FACE SLAPPED BY WET CLOTHES HANGING OUT TO DRY ON ROPES STRETCHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
PRAISED MARTHA THE SERVANT WHOM MRS THORNTON HAD FOUND FOR THEM
BUT I AM VERY MISERABLE
BUT HE WILL COME BACK ALMOST DIRECTLY
I HAVE NOT THE ELEMENTS FOR POPULARITY--IF THEY SPOKE OF ME IN THAT WAY THEY WERE MISTAKEN
SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE COULD ONLY GET HIM TO THEIR OWN HOUSE IT WAS SO GREAT A STEP GAINED THAT SHE WOULD TRUST TO THE CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS FOR THE NEXT
COME AND ASK HER ABOUT IT MARGARET
I AM NOT SURE IF HE DID NOT SAY HE HAD SENT IN HIS DEED OF RESIGNATION IN A FORTNIGHT EXCLAIMED MRS HALE I DO THINK THIS IS VERY STRANGE--NOT AT ALL RIGHT
TO SEE YOUR FACE AND NOT BE ABLE TO READ IT GIVES ME A WORSE DREAD THAN I TRUST ANY WORDS OF YOURS WILL JUSTIFY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY YOUR MOTHER SEEMS TO HAVE A MOST ATTENTIVE AND EFFICIENT SERVANT WHO IS MORE LIKE HER FRIEND I AM HER DAUGHTER SIR BUT WHEN I TELL YOU SHE EXPRESSLY DESIRED THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE TOLD I AM NOT GOOD OR PATIENT ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO THE PROHIBITION
IF THEIR SKILL AND THEIR FIRES WILL STAND IT THEIR TEMPERS WON'T
IT WAS RATHER THE INSTANTANEOUS FEROCITY OF EXPRESSION THAT COMES OVER THE COUNTENANCES OF ALL NATIVES OF WILD OR SOUTHERN COUNTRIES--A FEROCITY WHICH ENHANCES THE CHARM OF THE CHILDLIKE SOFTNESS INTO WHICH SUCH A LOOK MAY MELT AWAY
AND WAS TOUCHED BY THE HALF-SPOKEN WISHFUL ENTREATY THAT HE WOULD REMAIN A LITTLE LONGER--THE PLAINTIVE DON'T GO YET WHICH HIS POOR FRIEND PUT FORTH FROM TIME TO TIME
HERE IS FANNY THEN WHO IS SELDOM WITHOUT AN AILMENT
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR HIM
I KNOW WE DIFFER IN OUR RELIGIOUS OPINIONS
IT WAS AFFECTIONATE AND INCONSEQUENT LIKE THE WRITER
BUT I SET HIM OFF O TH ROAD AND SO I MUN ANSWER FOR HIM MR HALE GOT HOLD OF HIGGINS'S HAND AND SHOOK IT HEARTILY WITHOUT SPEAKING
HE BEGAN AGAIN SPEAKING RAPIDLY AS IF TO GET OVER A SET TASK
IN WHICH SHE COMES TO ME FOR HELP I WILL HELP HER WITH EVERY POWER I HAVE AS IF SHE WERE MY OWN DAUGHTER
IT NEEDED RATHER TO BE TWISTED ROUND AND ROUND AND HAVE ITS FINE SILKINESS COMPRESSED INTO MASSIVE COILS THAT ENCIRCLED HER HEAD LIKE A CROWN AND THEN WERE GATHERED INTO A LARGE SPIRAL KNOT BEHIND
SHE ONLY UNDERSTOOD TWO FACTS--THAT FREDERICK HAD BEEN IN DANGER OF BEING PURSUED AND DETECTED IN LONDON AS NOT ONLY GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER BUT AS THE MORE UNPARDONABLE LEADER OF THE MUTINY AND THAT SHE HAD LIED TO SAVE HIM
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HIS DEEP MORTIFICATION OF YESTERDAY AND THE STUNNED PURPOSELESS COURSE OF THE HOURS AFTERWARDS HAD CLEARED AWAY ALL THE MISTS FROM HIS INTELLECT
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK
AND IF YOU WANT SHOLTO HE CAN GO ON FROM OXFORD TO MILTON
THAT'S JUST A PIECE O MASTERS HUMBUG
SHE HAD ALWAYS A FRESH AND TENDER PRIDE IN SEEING HOW FAVOURABLY HE IMPRESSED EVERY STRANGER
SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF AS AN ILL-USED WOMAN BY HER POOR HUSBAND'S SUICIDE
I AM VERY SORRY YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTRAPPED INTO ALL THIS ALARM
WILL YOU SHOW YOUR READINESS TO MAKE SACRIFICES TO-MORROW MORNING FIRST BY ASKING ME TO BREAKFAST TO MEET MR BELL AND SECONDLY BY BEING SO KIND AS TO ORDER IT AT HALF-PAST NINE INSTEAD OF TEN O'CLOCK
SUDDENLY MARGARET SAID SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OF IT FOR SOME TIME BUT THE WORDS HAD STUCK IN HER THROAT HIGGINS HAVE YOU BEEN TO MARLBOROUGH MILLS TO SEEK FOR WORK THORNTON'S ASKED HE
AT LAST HE SPOKE
BUT NO
BUT NO
BUT NO
THESE ARE THE COTTAGES THAT HAUNTED ME SO DURING THE RAINY FORTNIGHT REPROACHING ME FOR NOT HAVING SKETCHED THEM BEFORE THEY TUMBLED DOWN AND WERE NO MORE SEEN
SHE TRIED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION FROM A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH ONE PARTY CARED LITTLE WHILE TO THE OTHER IT WAS DEEPLY BECAUSE PERSONALLY INTERESTING
YOU ARE NEITHER OF YOU REPRESENTATIVE MEN
BUT HOW WOULD YOU HAVE A WEDDING ARRANGED OH I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT IT
IT WAS TERRIBLE TO SEE THE PATIENT STRUGGLING EFFORT TO OBTAIN THE RESIGNATION WHICH HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO TAKE INTO HIS HEART AS A PART OF HIMSELF
HE WAS ONLY RATHER STRANGE AT FIRST BUT THAT MIGHT BE THE SHOCK OF POOR BESSY'S DEATH MARGARET'S EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
DIXON IS TO HAVE--LET ME SEE I HAD IT ONCE--THE BACK SITTING-ROOM
HERE YOU ARE
ON THE CONTRARY ALL THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS PECULIARLY CHARMING TO HER FROM THE VERY FIRST
ONLY LET US COME BACK HERE
THERE LAY MRS HALE--A MOTHER LIKE HERSELF--A MUCH YOUNGER WOMAN THAN SHE WAS,--ON THE BED FROM WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT EVER RISE AGAIN
AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
I CAN SEE THAT HE IS TORMENTING HIMSELF ALREADY WITH THE IDEA THAT MAMMA WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ILL IF WE HAD STAYED AT HELSTONE AND YOU DON'T KNOW PAPA'S AGONISING POWER OF SELF-REPROACH FREDERICK WALKED AWAY AS IF HE WERE ON THE QUARTER-DECK
I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE ONE MAY HAVE WEIGHTY REASONS WHICH MAY AND OUGHT TO MAKE HER OVERLOOK ANY SEEMING IMPROPRIETY IN HER CONDUCT
YOU DO NOT KNOW THE SOUTH MR THORNTON SHE CONCLUDED COLLAPSING INTO A DETERMINED SILENCE AND ANGRY WITH HERSELF FOR HAVING SAID SO MUCH
I SHALL LIKE TO HEAR HOW THEY MANAGE THESE THINGS IN MILTON
THE MERE BODILY WORK AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE WOULD BREAK YOU DOWN
HE WAS NOT GOING TO BLUBBER BEFORE A SET OF STRANGERS
MARY CAME TREMBLING TOWARDS HIM
MR BELL DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE EVEN ON THE DAY TO WHICH HE HAD FOR A SECOND TIME DEFERRED HIS VISIT
AND I'D PROMISE MORE
WHO IS HE SURELY I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM WHEN THE FAMILY FIRST CAME TO MILTON--THE SON WHO WAS CONCERNED IN THAT MUTINY I NEVER HEARD OF HIM TILL THIS MOMENT
BESSY WAS ROCKING HERSELF VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AS WAS HER WONT MARGARET KNEW BY THIS TIME WHEN SHE WAS AGITATED
RUN RUN GASPED MARGARET
AND NOW SHE WAS SURE OF A PLEASANT EVENING
BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE THRO WHICH THINE EYE FIRST LOOKED IN LOVE TO THE SUMMER SKY MRS
I MUST SEE SHE DOES NOT OVERSTRAIN HERSELF
HER QUIET COLDNESS OF DEMEANOUR HE INTERPRETED INTO CONTEMPTUOUSNESS AND RESENTED IT IN HIS HEART TO THE PITCH OF ALMOST INCLINING HIM TO GET UP AND GO AWAY AND HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THESE HALES AND THEIR SUPERCILIOUSNESS
SHE LEFT THE ROOM TO MAKE HER HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS
YO DID THE BEST YO COULD FOR THEM AS WANTED HELP
I THINK THEY SAW HOW CAREFUL I WAS TO LEAVE THEM FREE AND NOT TO INTRUDE MY OWN IDEAS UPON THEM
AND SHE CAUGHT THE TONE AND THREW THE BALL BACK
THEY DID NOT SPEAK
YOU HAD BETTER TAKE MAMMA HER TEA WHILE IT IS HOT DIXON SAID MARGARET IN A TONE OF QUIET AUTHORITY
MARGARET HAD ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE WORLD TO PERSUADE HER FATHER NOT TO INVITE MR THORNTON
I COULD BEAR UP FOR PAPA
FANNY ASKED HER MOTHER NUMEROUS SMALL QUESTIONS ALL HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT WHICH A WISER PERSON WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED WAS OCCUPYING HER ATTENTION
HE IS QUITE ALONE AND WILL BE WONDERING WHY I WILL GO TO HIM BROKE IN HER FATHER
AND NOW HE IS IN SPAIN
IT WAS AGAIN A LONG VACATION AND HE WAS STAYING WITH HIS NEWLY MARRIED FRIEND THE PROUD HUSBAND AND HAPPY VICAR OF HELSTONE
WITH YOUR BRAINS IF YOU CAN KEEP THEM TO YOUR OWN I SHALL NEED A DEAL O BRAINS TO SETTLE WHERE MY BUSINESS ENDS AND YO'RS BEGINS YOUR BUSINESS HAS NOT BEGUN YET AND MINE STANDS STILL FOR ME
HE'S A MAGISTRATE--AH
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM MAMMA ASKED SHE
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES
LINGERING WOULD ONLY ADD STINGS TO THE PAIN
BUT I WILL CERTAINLY COME IF YOU WISH IT REPLIED MR LENNOX WITH A LITTLE AFTERTHOUGHT OF EXTREME WILLINGNESS WHICH MADE MARGARET SHRINK INTO HERSELF AND ALMOST WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT PROPOSED HER NATURAL REQUEST
I DUNNOT BELIEVE IN ANY OTHER LIFE THAN THIS IN WHICH SHE DREED SUCH TROUBLE AND HAD SUCH NEVER-ENDING CARE
ISN'T PAPA COME IN HE ASKED FOR YOU MISS
I KNEW I WAS NOT SHE GROUND OUT WORDS BETWEEN HER CLOSED TEETH
PRAY SIR INSTEAD OF GROWING LARGER AND LARGER EVERY INSTANT AND BEWILDERING ME WITH YOUR MISTY OUTLINES WOULD YOU ONCE MORE COMPRESS YOURSELF INTO YOUR FORMER DIMENSIONS AND WHEN I'VE GOT HIM DOWN DON'T I CLAP THE SEAL ON THE VASE AND TAKE GOOD CARE HOW I OPEN IT AGAIN AND HOW I GO AGAINST SOLOMON WISEST OF MEN WHO CONFINED HIM THERE BUT IT WAS NO SMILING MATTER TO MARGARET
BUT AS THE RIGIDITY MELTED OUT OF THE COUNTENANCE AND THE NATURAL COLOUR RETURNED AND SHE SAW THAT HE WAS HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN ALL WORLDLY MORTIFICATION SANK TO NOTHING BEFORE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE GREAT BLESSING THAT HE HIMSELF BY HIS SIMPLE EXISTENCE WAS TO HER
SHE WHO HAD HITHERTO FELT THAT EVEN THE MOST REFINED REMARK ON HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE WAS AN IMPERTINENCE HAD TO ENDURE UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION FROM THESE OUTSPOKEN MEN
WHICH AFTER ALL INSPIRED THE DYING WOMAN WITH FAITH AS IN SOMETHING MORE STABLE THAN LIFE ITSELF,--FLICKERING FLITTING WAVERING LIFE
YOU DID NOT
AND THE VERY FORCE OF HER WILL BROUGHT HER ROUND
I ONLY WENT TO OXENHAM ONCE AFTER I WAS MARRIED,--TO YOUR AUNT SHAW'S WEDDING
TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM
HE WAS MY GROOM'S-MAN MARGARET UNDERSTOOD THE ASSOCIATION
ONE TO STOP TWO TO STAY THREE MAK READY AND FOUR AWAY THE LITTLE FELLOW REPEATED A METHODIST HYMN FAR ABOVE HIS COMPREHENSION IN POINT OF LANGUAGE BUT OF WHICH THE SWINGING RHYTHM HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR AND WHICH HE REPEATED WITH ALL THE DEVELOPED CADENCE OF A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
BESIDES EDITH EXPECTS US
HALLO
BUT NOW THAT HE SAW MARGARET WITH HER SUPERB WAYS OF MOVING AND LOOKING HE BEGAN TO FEEL ASHAMED OF HAVING IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR THE HALES IN SPITE OF A CERTAIN VULGARITY IN IT WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS LOOKING IT OVER
MARGARET SAID MRS HALE RATHER QUERULOUSLY YOU WON'T LIKE ANYTHING MR THORNTON DOES
SHE MAY BE DANGEROUSLY ILL AND IN IMMEDIATE DANGER TOO
ALL OF THEM ARE SAILORS DRAFTED OFF TO OTHER SHIPS EXCEPT THOSE WHOSE EVIDENCE WOULD GO FOR VERY LITTLE AS THEY TOOK PART OR SYMPATHISED IN THE AFFAIR
AND IF WE'RE TO KEEP MASTER FREDERICK IN HIDING HE WOULD HAVE TO GO POOR FELLOW BEFORE MR BELL CAME OH I'M NOT AFRAID OF MR BELL
I KNOW HE HAS HAD HER IN HIS MIND THIS FIVE YEARS OR MORE
BOY AND MAN HE'S THE NOBLEST STOUTEST HEART I EVER KNEW
AND I DARE SAY MASTER MIGHT IF HE'D JUST MINDED MISSUS AND LET THE WEARY READING AND THINKING ALONE.--THERE SHE GOES LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE HEARD THE FRONT DOOR SHUT POOR YOUNG LADY
I UNDERSTOOD FROM MR BELL THAT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE MILTON
MARGARET HERSELF HAD PROBABLY THE WORST TEMPER OF THE THREE FOR HER QUICK PERCEPTIONS AND OVER-LIVELY IMAGINATION MADE HER HASTY AND HER EARLY ISOLATION FROM SYMPATHY HAD MADE HER PROUD
FOR ICY IT WAS THOUGH THE WORDS CAME FALTERING OUT AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHERE TO FIND THEM
GO AWAY SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
HE WAS ON THE STEPS BELOW
AND MANY OTHERS HAVE AS WELL
IT WAS A VERY BUSY DAY BUT I SAW THAT THE MEN WOULD BE HURT IF AFTER MAKING THE ADVANCE I DIDN'T MEET THEM HALF-WAY SO I WENT IN AND I NEVER MADE A BETTER DINNER IN MY LIFE
POOR MAMMA NOW DON'T YE SET OFF AGAIN OR I SHALL GIVE WAY AT LAST WHIMPERING YOU'LL NEVER STAND MASTER'S COMING HOME AND QUESTIONING AT THIS RATE
TO-MORROW IF IT WERE POSSIBLE
SHE KNEW AND HAD RATHER REVELLED IN THE IDEA THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET
TO USE A SCOTCH WORD EVERY THING LOOKED MORE PURPOSELIKE THE COUNTRY CARTS HAD MORE IRON AND LESS WOOD AND LEATHER ABOUT THE HORSE-GEAR
MR THORNTON FELT THAT IN THIS INFLUX NO ONE WAS SPEAKING TO MARGARET AND WAS RESTLESS UNDER THIS APPARENT NEGLECT
LET ME BE THIS DAY MR HALE WOULD HAVE URGED THEIR DESIRE BUT MARGARET PLACED HER FINGER ON HIS LIPS
WHAT HE WAS DOING
IT'S OUR ONLY POWER
I'LL TELL YO IT'S THEIR PART,--THEIR CUE AS SOME FOLKS CALL IT,--TO BEAT US DOWN TO SWELL THEIR FORTUNES
I RECKON I'VE HEERD MY MOTHER READ OUT A TEXT THE FATHERS HAVE EATEN SOUR GRAPES AND TH CHILDREN'S TEETH ARE SET ON EDGE IT'S SO WI THEM
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU THOUGHT IT TAINTED YOU TO BE LOVED BY ME
I DO NOT LOOK ON SELF-INDULGENT SENSUAL PEOPLE AS WORTHY OF MY HATRED
IF A MAN DOESN'T BELONG TO TH UNION THEM AS WORKS NEXT LOOMS HAS ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO HIM--IF HE'S SORRY OR ILL IT'S A THE SAME
A LETTER FROM MASTER FREDERICK THANK YOU DIXON
SUPPOSING WILLIAMS GOT STRAIGHT OFF WHEN I TOLD HIM AND HADN'T TO DODGE ABOUT AMONGST THEM--IT MUST BE TWENTY MINUTES YET TWENTY MINUTES SAID HIS MOTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWING HER TERROR IN THE TONES OF HER VOICE
MRS SHAW HAD GIVEN WAY TO THE PRESENTIMENT AS SHE EXPRESSED IT
BUT I WILL BE VERY CALM AND VERY QUIET AND SAY VERY LITTLE
AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT MARGARET SAW THAT HER FATHER SHRANK MORE AND MORE
PERHAPS WE SHALL SEE BOTH OF THEM HERE BEFORE ANOTHER YEAR IS OUT MR HALE'S CHEERFUL SUBJECTS HAD COME TO AN END
HIS AGENT HAD LARGELY TRUSTED A HOUSE IN THE AMERICAN TRADE WHICH WENT DOWN ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHERS JUST AT THIS TIME LIKE A PACK OF CARDS THE FALL OF ONE COMPELLING OTHER FAILURES
AND ALMOST REPROACHED HER HUSBAND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE WISHED TO LEAVE THE PARISH AND UNDERTAKE THE CHARGE OF A LARGER
I TELL YO AGAIN I SAW YO AS PLAINLY COMING SWIFTLY TOWARDS ME WI YO'R HAIR BLOWN BACK WI THE VERY SWIFTNESS O THE MOTION JUST LIKE THE WAY IT GROWS A LITTLE STANDING OFF LIKE
PAPA SAID SHE THROWING HER ARMS FONDLY ROUND HIS NECK
WHEN SHE AWOKE A NEW IDEA FLASHED UPON HER WITH ALL THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING
HE LASHED HIMSELF INTO AN AGONY OF FIERCE JEALOUSY
THE LITTLE CRANE'S-BILL THAT GREW IN THE CREVICES
THEY NEVER SPOKE OF SUCH THINGS AGAIN AS IT HAPPENED
HE STOOD STILL FOR A MOMENT TO MAKE THIS RESOLUTION FIRM AND CLEAR
BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MRS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF-HOUR
BUT WE SHALL BE HAVING OUR DINNER-PARTIES SOON--AS SOON AS HENRY COMES BACK FROM CIRCUIT--AND THEN THERE WILL BE A LITTLE PLEASANT VARIETY FOR YOU
STILL IF IT WILL RELIEVE YOU FROM EVEN A FANCIED OBLIGATION SPEAK ON I DO NOT WANT TO BE RELIEVED FROM ANY OBLIGATION SAID HE GOADED BY HER CALM MANNER
YOU CONSIDER ME MISTAKEN AND I CONSIDER YOU FAR MORE FATALLY MISTAKEN
MARGARET HAD RESOLVED NOT TO MENTION THE CROWNING AND CLOSING AFFRIGHT TO HER FATHER
HE ROSE AS IF TO FOLLOW MARGARET WHO HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE WINDOW HE ONLY AWAITED MRS HALE'S PERMISSION
THE SUPERINTENDENT WOULD WHERE IS SHE HE LOOKED ROUND THE DINING-ROOM AND THEN ALMOST FIERCELY AT HIS MOTHER WHO WAS QUIETLY RE-ARRANGING THE DISTURBED FURNITURE AND DID NOT INSTANTLY REPLY
GATHERING GATHERING ALONG THE NARROW STREET CAME A HOLLOW MEASURED SOUND
BUT IN THEIR ABSENCE THEY HAD GROWN NEARER TO EACH OTHER IN AGE AS WELL AS IN MANY OTHER THINGS
I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE POWER OF WILL
WHY THE LAST SIR JOHN BUT TWO SHOT HIS STEWARD DOWN THERE WHERE HE STOOD FOR JUST TELLING HIM THAT HE'D RACKED THE TENANTS AND HE'D RACKED THE TENANTS TILL HE COULD GET NO MORE MONEY OFF THEM THAN HE COULD GET SKIN OFF A FLINT WELL DIXON I WON'T SHOOT YOU AND I'LL TRY NOT TO BE CROSS AGAIN YOU NEVER HAVE
I SUPPOSE SO IF HE CAN COME HE WILL BE HERE TO-MORROW EVENING I SHOULD THINK IF HE CANNOT COME I SHALL ASK MR THORNTON TO GO WITH ME TO THE FUNERAL
GO DOWN AND FACE THEM LIKE A MAN
AND SHE IS TOO WEAK AND MISERABLE TO HAVE A WILL OF HER OWN SHE MUST INDEED BE WEAK SAID MRS THORNTON WITH AN IMPLIED MEANING WHICH HER SON UNDERSTOOD WELL
IN LENNOX'S CASE HE SEEMED FOR A MOMENT TO HAVE SLID OVER THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE
SO MEASTER I'LL COME
I HOPE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME NO YOU WOULD NOT
BUT NOW IN THIS REAL GREAT TIME OF REASONABLE FEAR AND NEARNESS OF TERROR SHE FORGOT HERSELF AND FELT ONLY AN INTENSE SYMPATHY--INTENSE TO PAINFULNESS--IN THE INTERESTS OF THE MOMENT
YOU WILL ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO THIS AND THAT
YOU MUST GO ELSEWHERE FOR A PATIENT DOCTOR BY THE WAY YOU'VE RECOMMENDED ME A GOOD PATIENT POOR LADY
SHE HEARD NO NOISE THOUGH THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN TO ARRANGE THE ROOM
WHEN I CAN I SHALL BRING MY YOUNG MAN TO STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUR YOUNG WOMAN JUST AS THE GENIE IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS BROUGHT PRINCE CARALMAZAN TO MATCH WITH THE FAIRY'S PRINCESS BADOURA I BEG YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING
I'M AFEARED HOO'S TOO FAR GONE IN A WASTE I SHALL HAVE A SPRING WHERE I'M BOUN TO AND FLOWERS AND AMARANTHS AND SHINING ROBES BESIDES POOR LASS POOR LASS SAID HER FATHER IN A LOW TONE
C
WHATTEN'S THIS WENCH
NEXT SUNDAY I PREACH MY FAREWELL SERMON WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
OH MAMMA HOW YOU TERRIFIED ME
HERE--WELL
AY AND BETTER TOO
I AM GLAD YOU THINK HE LOOKS ANXIOUS
SHE WAS TALKING TO FANNY
BUT HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FIRST FRUIT-SHOP IN MILTON AND CHOSE OUT THE BUNCH OF PURPLE GRAPES WITH THE MOST DELICATE BLOOM UPON THEM,--THE RICHEST-COLOURED PEACHES,--THE FRESHEST VINE-LEAVES
THE FIRST TOUCH WOULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION IN WHICH AMONG SUCH HUNDREDS OF INFURIATED MEN AND RECKLESS BOYS EVEN MR THORNTON'S LIFE WOULD BE UNSAFE,--THAT IN ANOTHER INSTANT THE STORMY PASSIONS WOULD HAVE PASSED THEIR BOUNDS AND SWEPT AWAY ALL BARRIERS OF REASON OR APPREHENSION OF CONSEQUENCE
WHICH HOWEVER WOULD SEEM VERY INCOMPLETE WITH-OUT MARGARET
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT EXCLAIMED MR BELL IN SURPRISE
IT WAS VERY WELL THEY DID--TO JUDGE FROM THE FRAGMENTS OF CONVERSATION WHICH MARGARET OVERHEARD
PERHAPS IT IS NOT--NAY POSSIBLY THERE IS JUST A LITTLE COUSINLY LOVE MIXED WITH IT
I DON'T PARTICULARLY ADMIRE LADIES MEN PAPA
SHE WAS AT AN UP-STAIRS WINDOW
AND THEN SOUGHT TO VEIL HER LUMINOUS EYES BY DROPPING HER FOREHEAD ON HER HANDS
IF ONLY MR THORNTON WOULD RESTORE HER THE LOST FRIENDSHIP,--NAY IF HE WOULD ONLY COME FROM TIME TO TIME TO CHEER HER FATHER AS IN FORMER DAYS,--THOUGH SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM SHE FELT AS IF THE COURSE OF HER FUTURE LIFE THOUGH NOT BRILLIANT IN PROSPECT MIGHT LIE CLEAR AND EVEN BEFORE HER
SHE SAT DOWN SILENT AND PALE
HE WAS THERE IN THE HOUSE
BROWNING
BROWNING
BROWNING
BROWNING
BUT I'M AFRAID IT IS A LONG IF NOW DIXON DID NOT LIKE THIS SPEECH
AND TOOK SALTS AND SENNA WHEN ANYTHING AILED THEM
ONCE A YEAR THERE WAS A LONG DISCUSSION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND EDITH AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT ABROAD OR TO SCOTLAND
I AM NOT LIKELY EVER TO SEE MR THORNTON AGAIN,'--AND THERE SHE STOPPED
WE ARE THROWING OUT A WINDOW TO THE ROAD ON THIS SIDE
NO ONE CAN TELL WHAT YOU ARE TO ME
HE SWEPT OFF HIS BUSINESS RIGHT AND LEFT THAT DAY
ALL THAT HE GAINED IN RETURN FOR HIS SIXPENNY OMNIBUS RIDE WAS A MORE VIVID CONVICTION THAT THERE NEVER WAS NEVER COULD BE ANY ONE LIKE MARGARET
MR HALE WOULD HAVE DELAYED MAKING IT TILL HALF-PAST SIX BUT MARGARET WAS OF DIFFERENT STUFF
HER AUNT SHAW WAS TALKING TO THE FIVE OR SIX LADIES WHO HAD BEEN DINING THERE AND WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE STILL IN THE DINING-ROOM
WE ARE OPEN ENEMIES
SOSPIRA THE FIRST SYMPTOM OF RETURNING LIFE WAS A QUIVERING ABOUT THE LIPS--A LITTLE MUTE SOUNDLESS ATTEMPT AT SPEECH
BUT IT IS NOT TO CLEAR MYSELF OF ANY SUSPICION OF IMPROPER CONDUCT THAT I WISH TO HAVE HIM TOLD--IF I THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SUSPECTED ME I SHOULD NOT CARE FOR HIS GOOD OPINION--NO
BUT ON STROKING HER CHEEK IN A CARESSING WAY SOON AFTER HE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED TO FIND HER FACE WET WITH TEARS
IT IS VERY UNLIKELY MA'AM THAT I SHALL HAVE TO DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND
HIS GREATEST COMFORT WAS IN HUGGING HIS TORMENT
AND ARE YOU GOING TO DINE AT THORNTON'S AT MARLBOROUGH MILLS YES BESSY
I TAKE THE RISK
HE SAID SHE HAD NO MERIT IN BEING WHAT SHE WAS A GIRL SO ENTIRELY AFTER HIS OWN HEART
BUT FOR HER SAKE FRED YOU SURELY WILL TRY AND CLEAR YOURSELF OF THE EXAGGERATED CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST YOU EVEN IF THE CHARGE OF MUTINY ITSELF BE TRUE
MAPPEN NOT SO HARD
SHE COULD NOT BE ALONE PROSTRATE POWERLESS AS SHE WAS,--A CLOUD OF FACES LOOKED UP AT HER GIVING HER NO IDEA OF FIERCE VIVID ANGER OR OF PERSONAL DANGER BUT A DEEP SENSE OF SHAME THAT SHE SHOULD THUS BE THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL REGARD--A SENSE OF SHAME SO ACUTE THAT IT SEEMED AS IF SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE BURROWED INTO THE EARTH TO HIDE HERSELF AND YET SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE OUT OF THAT UNWINKING GLARE OF MANY EYES
THE MASTERS--MR THORNTON IN PARTICULAR WHOSE MILL HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY BOUCHER AND WHO AFTER THE WARRANT HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR HIS APPREHENSION ON THE CHARGE OF RIOTING HAD CAUSED IT TO BE WITHDRAWN,--THE UNION OF WHICH HIGGINS WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE TO THE POOR WOMAN,--THE CHILDREN SO NUMEROUS SO HUNGRY AND SO NOISY--ALL MADE UP ONE GREAT ARMY OF PERSONAL ENEMIES WHOSE FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS NOW A HELPLESS WIDOW
BUT THESE MAY BE ONLY LAWYER'S DODGES
GIVE ME THE POOR COMFORT OF TELLING ME YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY ONE WHOM YOU COULD AGAIN A PAUSE
NOW MARGARET YOU'RE YOUNG ENOUGH AND GO ABOUT IN THE DAY
BUT IN AN INSTANT--FROM WHAT ABOUT HIM SHE COULD NOT TELL--SHE WISHED HERSELF BACK WITH HER MOTHER--HER FATHER--ANYWHERE AWAY FROM HIM FOR SHE WAS SURE HE WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO WHICH SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO REPLY
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING MY DUTY BY TALKING TO HER AND TRYING TO AMUSE HER WELL
THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU
THE HEAVY MOISTURE OF TEARS STOOD ON THE EYE-LASHES BEFORE SHE LOOKED UP THEN WITH HER HAND GROPING FEEBLY OVER THE BED-CLOTHES FOR THE TOUCH OF MRS THORNTON'S LARGE FIRM FINGERS SHE SAID SCARCELY ABOVE HER BREATH--MRS THORNTON HAD TO STOOP FROM HER ERECTNESS TO LISTEN MARGARET--YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER--MY SISTER IS IN ITALY
MR THORNTON WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO MARK HIS GRATEFUL APPROBATION OF ANY SENSIBLE MAN WHO COULD BE CAPTIVATED BY FANNY'S SECOND-RATE AIRS AND GRACES BY GIVING HER AMPLE MEANS FOR PROVIDING HERSELF WITH THE FINERY WHICH CERTAINLY RIVALLED IF IT DID NOT EXCEED THE LOVER IN HER ESTIMATION
I'LL WRITE HERE NOW,--YOU SHALL SEE ME WRITE,--AND IT SHALL GO BY THIS VERY POST
THEY CAN BE GETTING ON WITH THESE TILL I ARRIVE
BUT DIXON WAS TOO LOYAL TO DESERT HER IN HER AFFLICTION AND DOWNFALL ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS
NOT ABOVE THREE FEET
MISS MARGET--MISS HALE--TH OUD PARSON'S DAUGHTER--YO KNOWN WHO I MEAN WELL ENOUGH IF YO'LL ONLY THINK A BIT THERE WAS NOTHING DISRESPECTFUL IN THE TONE IN WHICH THIS WAS SAID OH YES AND SUDDENLY THE WINTRY FROST-BOUND LOOK OF CARE HAD LEFT MR THORNTON'S FACE AS IF SOME SOFT SUMMER GALE HAD BLOWN ALL ANXIETY AWAY FROM HIS MIND
HER VOICE WAS CHOKED AS SHE WENT ON--WAS QUAVERING AS WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF SOME STRANGE YET CLOSELY-PRESENT IDEA
THEY DREW VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER IN UNSPOKEN SYMPATHY
BUT AT ANY RATE DO SOMETHING NOT EXCLUDING MISCHIEF SAID MARGARET SMILING FAINTLY THROUGH HER TEARS
AND HER MIND SOUGHT FOR SOME PRESENT FACT TO STEADY ITSELF UPON AND KEEP IT FROM UTTERLY LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS IN ANOTHER HIDEOUS SICKLY SWOON
AND IF SHE DID LEAN BACK IN HER CHAIR AND SPEAK BUT LITTLE EDITH WAS NOT ANNOYED FOR THE CONVERSATION FLOWED ON SMOOTHLY WITHOUT HER
I SHALL BE SORRY TO LEAVE YOU
MARGARET THE CHURCHWOMAN HER FATHER THE DISSENTER HIGGINS THE INFIDEL KNELT DOWN TOGETHER
IF NEED WERE SHE WOULD DO THE SAME TO-MORROW,--BY A CRIPPLED BEGGAR WILLINGLY AND GLADLY,--BUT BY HIM SHE WOULD DO IT JUST AS BRAVELY IN SPITE OF HIS DEDUCTIONS AND THE COLD SLIME OF WOMEN'S IMPERTINENCE
NEW STREET SAID MR HALE
ONE DAY EDITH LET OUT ACCIDENTALLY A FRAGMENT OF A CONVERSATION WHICH SHE HAD HAD WITH MR BELL WHEN HE WAS LAST IN LONDON WHICH POSSESSED MARGARET WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD SOME NOTION OF TAKING HER TO PAY A VISIT TO HER BROTHER AND NEW SISTER-IN-LAW AT CADIZ IN THE AUTUMN
BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT
SHE TOO GAZED BACK WITH PLEADING EYES BEFORE SHE WOULD BELIEVE THAT IT WAS IRREVOCABLE
SO BOUCHER SLUNK BACK AGAIN TO HIS HOUSE
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF MOVEMENT AROUND HER AND OF REFRESHMENT FROM THE EAU DE COLOGNE AND A CRAVING FOR THE BATHING TO GO ON WITHOUT INTERMISSION
FROM THAT DAY FORWARDS MRS HALE BECAME MORE AND MORE OF A SUFFERING INVALID
HOW WAN YOU LOOK MARGARET SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE
EVEN MR LENNOX'S WELL-REGULATED PROFESSIONAL VOICE TOOK A SOFTER TENDERER TONE AS HE DREW NEAR TO THE EXTINCTION OF THE LAST HOPE
ONLY ONE VOICE CRIED OUT
I'M NOT GOING FOR TO TAKE YO'R BRASS SO DUNNOT THINK IT
YOU WOULD ONLY LAUGH AT ME IF I TOLD YOU WHAT I THINK OF IT--WHAT IT REALLY IS INDEED I WOULD NOT
HER FATHER'S LIPS MOVED AFTER HER REPEATING THE WELL-KNOWN TEXTS AS HER WORDS SUGGESTED THEM
AND THAT IN THE FAMILY INTERCOURSE WHICH CONSTANTLY THREW THEM TOGETHER HER OPINION WAS THE ONE TO WHICH HE LISTENED WITH A DEFERENCE,--THE MORE COMPLETE BECAUSE IT WAS RELUCTANTLY PAID AND CONCEALED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
AND AWAY FROM THE ENDLESS ENDLESS NOISE AND SICKENING HEAT IT'S SOMETIMES IN HEAVY RAIN AND SOMETIMES IN BITTER COLD
I MUST TELL FREDERICK
OH JANE SAID SHE CREEPING INTO THE DINING-ROOM WHAT IS THE MATTER
THEY WERE A DULL LIST OF WORDS BUT SOMEHOW HE LIKED LOOKING AT THEM
BUT BY-AND-BY A LITTLE GENTLE RELUCTANT YES AND YOU REFUSED HIM A LONG SIGH
NOTHING HAD BEEN THE SAME
TRUST THE CARE OF HIM TO ME MAMMA
I WISH YOU TO GO DIXON DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO RESENT THESE DECIDED WORDS OR TO CRY
BUT YOU SEEM TO HAVE IMAGINED THAT I WAS NOT MERELY GUIDED BY WOMANLY INSTINCT BUT'--AND HERE THE PASSIONATE TEARS KEPT DOWN FOR LONG--STRUGGLED WITH VEHEMENTLY CAME UP INTO HER EYES AND CHOKED HER VOICE--'BUT THAT I WAS PROMPTED BY SOME PARTICULAR FEELING FOR YOU--YOU
HE FELT HIS PULSE
IT IS ALL RIGHT DEAR
SHE DESIRED ME TO APOLOGISE TO YOU AS IT IS
I SHALL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BEHAVE IN THE SAME WAY TO HIM WITH THIS MISERABLE CONSCIOUSNESS UPON ME
BUT THIS SEEMED A LOSS BY ITSELF
OH IS THERE NO GOING BACK NO FATHER SAID MARGARET LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM AND SPEAKING LOW AND STEADILY
NOT TO BEAR COMPARISON WITH ANY OTHER EVENT IN THE WORLD
OH DO NOT USE VIOLENCE
MISS HALE IS HURT MOTHER
MRS SHAW WAS BREAKFASTING IN HER OWN ROOM AND UPON HIM DEVOLVED THE TASK OF RECONCILING HIS WIFE TO THE NEAR CONTACT INTO WHICH SHE SEEMED TO BE BROUGHT WITH DEATH FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE COULD REMEMBER IN HER LIFE
LAUGHED SO MERRILY THAT IT GRATED ON MRS THORNTON'S EAR AS IF THE WORDS THAT CALLED FORTH THAT LAUGH MUST HAVE BEEN UTTERLY AND ENTIRELY LUDICROUS
HE IS NOT VERY ILL OR HE WOULD NOT THINK OF SPAIN HE NEVER MENTIONS SPAIN NO
THE UNUSUAL SCENES MOVING BEFORE HER LIKE PICTURES WHICH SHE CARED NOT IN HER LAZINESS TO HAVE FULLY EXPLAINED BEFORE THEY PASSED AWAY
IT WAS POOR DARLING FRED I TOOK WITH ME I REMEMBER
I DON'T LIKE TO BE SPOKEN TO AS YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
AND DID NOT TEND TO PROMOTE ANY FORBEARANCE ON HER PART EVEN TO THIS BELOVED SON
OR ONLY REMEMBERED THEM ENOUGH TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL TENDER GRAVITY TO THEIR MANNER
I SUPPOSE OTHER COOKS ARE TO BE MET WITH THAT'S SO LIKE A MAN
DEAD
AND MR THORNTON NEVER KNEW BUT THAT THE OVERLOOKER TO WHOM HE HAD GIVEN THE COMMAND IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HAD DONE IT HIMSELF
IF MARY HIGGINS WAS REQUIRED AS A HELP TO DIXON IN THE KITCHEN SHE WAS TO HEAR AND SEE AS LITTLE OF FREDERICK AS POSSIBLE
IT WAS LONG SINCE MRS HALE HAD BEEN IN LONDON
HE WAS PLEASED WITH EVERYTHING
AND THEN IN OTHER PARTS THERE ARE BILLOWY FERNS--WHOLE STRETCHES OF FERN
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE HALL
TO BE SURE IT WAS A DINING-ROOM
DON'T PLEASE IMPLORED SHE
UNLOVED THE SUN-FLOWER SHINING FAIR RAY ROUND WITH FLAMES HER DISK OF SEED AND MANY A ROSE-CARNATION FEED WITH SUMMER SPICE THE HUMMING AIR
I AM AS SURE THAT HE WILL COME DIRECTLY TO US AS I AM SURE OF MY LIFE
SHOULD YOU HAVE LIKED YOUR SISTER TO HAVE BEEN NOTICED BY A GROCER'S ASSISTANT FOR DOING SO IN THE FIRST PLACE AS IT IS NOT MANY YEARS SINCE I MYSELF WAS A DRAPER'S ASSISTANT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A GROCER'S ASSISTANT NOTICING ANY ACT DOES NOT ALTER THE CHARACTER OF THE ACT TO ME
BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH ELSE TO THINK ABOUT THAT I DID NOT DWELL ON IT AT ALL
FANNY SAID HER MOTHER AS THEY DROVE AWAY WE WILL BE CIVIL TO THESE HALES
WE DO NOT LOOK UPON LIFE AS A TIME FOR ENJOYMENT BUT AS A TIME FOR ACTION AND EXERTION
SHE WOULD NOT PART WITH IT EVEN WHILE SHE SLEPT
DON'T BE SHY BUT SAY YES AND HE JUMPED ON THE BUS AND I SAW HIS UGLY FACE LEERING AT ME WITH A WICKED SMILE TO THINK HOW HE'D HAD THE LAST WORD OF PLAGUING MARGARET WAS MADE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BY THIS ACCOUNT OF DIXON'S
MEASTER SAID HE STOPPING HIS EMPLOYER IN HIS QUICK RESOLVED WALK AND CAUSING THAT GENTLEMAN TO LOOK UP WITH A SUDDEN ANNOYED START AS IF HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN FAR AWAY
SHE WANTED EVERYTHING TO LOOK AS CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE
WONDERING IF ALL WENT ON IN THAT WHIRL JUST AS IF SHE AND HER FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN
IF INDEED I HAVE NOT CLAIMED YOU TO COME AND KEEP HOUSE FOR ME FIRST
BUT IN A MOMENT AFTERWARDS SHE ADDED BUT YOU'RE NOT FIT FOR IT
I KEEP MY MUSLINS IN THAT DRAWER DIXON DID NOT SPEAK BUT WENT ON RUMMAGING
AND SHE TURNED AWAY SIGHING
BUT WHERE WOULD I HEAR SUCH GRAND WORDS OF PROMISE--HEAR TELL O ANYTHING SO FAR DIFFERENT FRO THIS DREARY WORLD AND THIS TOWN ABOVE A AS IN REVELATIONS
IT CAME HOWLING DOWN THE CHIMNEY IN OUR ROOM
AND YOUR BOOK-SHELVES WILL HIDE A GREAT DEAL OF THAT GAUDY PATTERN IN THE DINING-ROOM THEN YOU THINK IT THE BEST
WHEN SHE GOT THERE SHE FOUND BESSY LYING ON THE SETTLE MOVED CLOSE TO THE FIRE THOUGH THE DAY WAS SULTRY AND OPPRESSIVE
WHEN I WAS A GIRL YOUNG MEN WERE SATISFIED WITH DRESSING ONCE IN A DAY
AND SOMETIMES QUITE LUSH WITH THE PERPETUAL MOISTURE OF A LITTLE HIDDEN TINKLING BROOK NEAR AT HAND
BUT I'VE BEEN SEEING HER TO-DAY AND I THINK VERY BADLY OF HER MR THORNTON WAS SILENT
CHAPTER XXX HOME AT LAST THE SADDEST BIRDS A SEASON FIND TO SING SOUTHWELL
I DECLARE I'VE A GOOD MIND TO FACE IT OUT AND STAND MY TRIAL
SHE SAT AND WAITED
THORNTON'S FACTORY YO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS HE SAID MARGARET COLOURING DEEP
BUT IT MUST BE NICE TO GO DRESSED AS YO DO
SO IT'S BUT A FEW OF TH MASTERS AS WILL PUT EM UP
CROMWELL WOULD HAVE MADE A CAPITAL MILL-OWNER MISS HALE
HERE'S SOMETHING TO DO YOU GOOD MISS
AN I TELL THEE PLAIN--IF HOO DIES AS I'M FEARD HOO WILL AFORE WE'VE GETTEN TH FIVE PER CENT I'LL FLING TH MONEY BACK I TH MASTER'S FACE AND SAY BE DOMNED TO YO
MARGARET DID NOT CARE IF THEIR GIFTS HAD PROLONGED THE STRIKE
INDEED ALL OTHER LIFE SEEMED SHUT OUT FROM THEM BY AS THICK A FOG OF CIRCUMSTANCE
AND SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT AS SOON AS EDITH RELEASED HIM FROM HER QUESTIONING HE WOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF THAT CHAIR
I MIGHT REDEEM MYSELF--I AM SORELY TEMPTED HOW
SHE HEARD MR THORNTON SAY
I NEVER THOUGHT OF HER WALKING AT THIS POINT MR THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL
IT'S AS IF SPEECHES FOLK HA MADE--CLEVER AND SMART THINGS AS I'VE THOUGHT AT THE TIME--COME UP NOW MY HEART'S WELLY BROSSEN
AT ANY RATE HER WORDS DO NOT TOUCH ME
SHE NEVER DREAMED THAT HE OR ANY ONE ELSE COULD FIND CAUSE FOR SUSPICION IN WHAT WAS SO NATURAL AS HER ACCOMPANYING HER BROTHER
I HAVE DISCOVERED NEW POWERS IN MY SITUATION TOO LATE--AND NOW ALL IS OVER
THERE ARE BRIARS BESETTING EVERY PATH WHICH CALL FOR PATIENT CARE
SHE KNEW HOW IT WAS
BUT I THINK IF WE COULD GET A WATER-BED IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING
HE IS HIS FATHER'S DARLING I SAY
A RICH MAN THERE LIVED ALONE IN ONE OF THE IMMENSE MANSIONS WHICH WERE FORMERLY BOTH DWELLINGS AND WAREHOUSES
SAVE THESE POOR STRANGERS WHOM YOU HAVE DECOYED HERE
AFTER A BAD NIGHT WITH HIS MOTHER FOR HE INSISTED ON TAKING HIS TURN AS A SITTER-UP HE WAS BUSY NEXT MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST CONTRIVING A LEG-REST FOR DIXON WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE FATIGUES OF WATCHING
THORNTON'S HOUSE IS THREE TIMES AS BIG WELL I THINK WE COULD MANAGE TO GIVE MR THORNTON A DINNER BACK AS YOU CALL IT
AND THE RENEWAL OF THIS KINDLINESS AFTER THE LAPSE OF YEARS AND AN INTERVAL OF SO MUCH CHANGE OVERPOWERED HIM MORE THAN ANY ROUGHNESS OR EXPRESSION OF DISAPPROVAL COULD HAVE DONE
MARGARET WAS WEARY AND IMPATIENT OF THE ACCOUNTS WHICH DIXON PERPETUALLY BROUGHT TO MRS HALE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF THESE WOULD-BE SERVANTS
DR DONALDSON MET THEM ON THE LANDING
IT WAS NOT THE LONG BLEAK SUNNY DAYS OF SPRING NOR YET WAS IT THAT TIME WAS RECONCILING HER TO THE TOWN OF HER HABITATION
I DON'T WANT HIM TO COME AT ALL
EDITH GAVE ME ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES FOR YOU
HOW WELL I REMEMBER IT
AND AFTER THE PAPER AND BRUSHES HAD BEEN DULY SELECTED THE TWO SET OUT IN THE MERRIEST SPIRITS IN THE WORLD
POOR CHILD!--POOR CHILD SAID HE LOOKING FONDLY AT HER AS SHE LAY WITH HER FACE TO THE WALL SHAKING WITH HER SOBS
AND YOU'LL NOT FORGET ME I'M SURE
PARTLY FOR THE PLEASURE SHE HAD IN BEING COAXED OUT OF HER DISLIKE BY HER FOND LOVER AND PARTLY BECAUSE ANYTHING OF A GIPSY OR MAKE-SHIFT LIFE WAS REALLY DISTASTEFUL TO HER
MR HALE AND HIS VISITOR HAD A GOOD DEAL TO SAY RESPECTING THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND MR BELL
EH SAID HE AS SHE CAME IN TO THINK OF TH OUD GENTLEMAN DROPPING OFF AS HE DID
STRIKE'S ENDED
NOT A MOOD OF HIS BUT WHAT FOUND A READY SYMPATHISER IN MARGARET
HER RESIDENCE IN MILTON HAS QUITE CORRUPTED HER
BUT DOING NEVER DID IN ALL MY LIFE
HE COULD NOT FORGET THE SUBJECT,--COULD NOT PASS FROM IT TO OTHER THINGS
AND WHEN I HAD GOT IN I COULD NOT GET OUT
SHE TOOK OUT HER PURSE
NOT BUT WHAT IT'S TRUE FOR ALL THAT MARGARET WAS SILENT
BLESS THY WHITE LIPS LASS,--THEY'VE A SMILE ON EM NOW
SHE WILL HAVE TO BEAR IT IF I SPEAK IN HER DEAD MOTHER'S NAME WELL SAID HE BREAKING AWAY DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE ABOUT IT
ONLY TWO MONTHS BEFORE FREDERICK WAS IN ENGLAND AND GAVE US THE NAMES OF FREDERICK IN ENGLAND
IF IT WERE FOR MYSEL I COULD STAND A DEAL O CLEMMING FIRST
YO JUST THINK FOR YO'RSEL WHAT IT MUN BE FOR FATHER TO HAVE A HIS WORK UNDONE AND BY SUCH A FOOL AS BOUCHER WHO MUST NEEDS GO RIGHT AGAIN THE ORDERS OF COMMITTEE AND RUIN TH STRIKE JUST AS BAD AS IF HE MEANT TO BE A JUDAS
I HAVE BEEN READING TO-DAY OF THE TWO THOUSAND WHO WERE EJECTED FROM THEIR CHURCHES,'--CONTINUED MR HALE SMILING FAINTLY,--'TRYING TO STEAL SOME OF THEIR BRAVERY
THE PLATFORM WAS ALL ALIGHT BUT STILL QUITE DESERTED
TO BE SURE THERE IS SOMETHING FINE IN A MAN OF MR HALE'S AGE LEAVING HIS HOME OF TWENTY YEARS AND GIVING UP ALL SETTLED HABITS FOR AN IDEA WHICH WAS PROBABLY ERRONEOUS--BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER--AN UNTANGIBLE THOUGHT
WE WASN'T FRIENDS
SHE WOULD BANISH ALL RECOLLECTION OF THE THORNTON FAMILY,--NO NEED TO THINK OF THEM TILL THEY ABSOLUTELY STOOD BEFORE HER IN FLESH AND BLOOD
IT WILL BE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE AND I FEAR THERE WILL BE SOME DANGER
MRS HALE WAS HURRIED
THIRTY POUNDS A-YEAR WAS ALL THEY COULD AFFORD TO GIVE BUT IN HAMPSHIRE THEY COULD HAVE MET WITH A ROOMY HOUSE AND PLEASANT GARDEN FOR THE MONEY
SHE WAS GRAVE AND LITTLE DISPOSED TO SPEAK
HOW IS MR THORNTON ASKED MR HALE
CAPTAIN LENNOX WAS EASY KIND AND GENTLEMANLY
I BELIEVE IT'S SLICKSON'S DOING,--CONFOUND HIM AND HIS DODGES
WHERE WERE THE POLICE
IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY
SHE WENT ALONG THERE WITH A BOUNDING FEARLESS STEP THAT OCCASIONALLY BROKE OUT INTO A RUN IF SHE WERE IN A HURRY AND OCCASIONALLY WAS STILLED INTO PERFECT REPOSE AS SHE STOOD LISTENING TO OR WATCHING ANY OF THE WILD CREATURES WHO SANG IN THE LEAFY COURTS OR GLANCED OUT WITH THEIR KEEN BRIGHT EYES FROM THE LOW BRUSHWOOD OR TANGLED FURZE
I DARE SAY IT IS PAST TEN O'CLOCK
NICHOLAS TOOK THE PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND STANDING UP PUSHED HIS CHAIR TOWARDS MARGARET
CULTIVATING WITH PROFOUND CALCULATION ALL THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT MIGHT EVENTUALLY BE OF SERVICE TO HIM
MR HALE SAID I
HENDERSON TRIED A DODGE WITH HIS MEN OUT AT ASHLEY AND FAILED
HE HAD TENDERNESS IN HIS HEART--'A SOFT PLACE AS NICHOLAS HIGGINS CALLED IT
IN ADDITION TO THIS AND HE GROUND HIS TEETH AS HE REMEMBERED IT WAS THE HOUR DUSKY TWILIGHT
SHE IS AFRAID I SHALL SPEAK WHAT WILL REQUIRE SOME STERN REPRESSION
DO THEY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF PERFECT REPOSE WHEN YOU LIE DOWN UPON THEM
TO MR HALE HE SAID THAT MARGARET OF YOURS HAS GONE DEEP INTO MY HEART
THE MEN ARE ALL GONE AWAY
FANNY LEFT MARGARET'S SIDE AND HELPED HER MOTHER TO RECEIVE HER GUESTS
SHE RELEASED HER STRONG WILL FROM ITS LABORIOUS TASK
THE HOUSE-LEEK AND STONE-CROP HAVE GROWN SO MUCH DARKER IN THE RAIN
AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE A CURSE ON THE CORNISH TRICK WHICH HAD HE SAID MADE HIM A HUNDRED POUNDS POORER THAN HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
HER EYE-LIDS ARE QUIVERING AND HERE'S WET TEARS A-COMING DOWN HER CHEEKS
HE HAD HEARD THAT MR HALE HAD A DAUGHTER BUT HE HAD IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL
AND IT WAS POOR AND DESPICABLE OF HER TO SHRINK FROM HEARING ANY SPEECH AS IF SHE HAD NOT POWER TO PUT AN END TO IT WITH HER HIGH MAIDENLY DIGNITY
YOU'D BE A KNOBSTICK
SHE COULD NOT CARE FOR HIM HE THOUGHT OR ELSE THE PASSIONATE FERVOUR OF HIS WISH WOULD HAVE FORCED HER TO RAISE THOSE EYES IF BUT FOR AN INSTANT TO READ THE LATE REPENTANCE IN HIS
IT WAS A PLEASURE TO FEEL HOW THOROUGHLY SHE RESPECTED HIM
HAS THAT LETTER VEXED OR TROUBLED YOU NO SAID MARGARET FEEBLY
MARGARET YOU MEAN
IN GENERAL HE WAS PARTICULAR AND DAINTY ENOUGH AND KNEW WELL EACH SHADE OF FLAVOUR IN HIS FOOD BUT NOW THE DEVILLED CHICKEN TASTED LIKE SAWDUST
BUT NICHOLAS WAS NEITHER AN HABITUAL DRUNKARD NOR A THOROUGH INFIDEL
THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM THAT AND IT WAS FOR HER TO DECIDE IF IT WAS MORE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL
I FANCY MRS THORNTON IS AS HAUGHTY AND PROUD IN HER WAY AS OUR LITTLE MARGARET HERE IS IN HERS AND THAT SHE COMPLETELY IGNORES THAT OLD TIME OF TRIAL AND POVERTY AND ECONOMY OF WHICH HE SPEAKS SO OPENLY
NICHOLAS WAS VERY WELL SHE BELIEVED
BUT THE PAPERS
MARGARET WAS CONSIDERING WHAT TO SAY
SHE WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR MR THORNTON ANNOUNCED
MR BARBOUR WON'T LET US CALL IT AN ENGAGEMENT
BUT AFTER A MINUTE'S PAUSE HE RAISED HIMSELF FROM HIS HALF RECUMBENT POSITION IN ONE OF MR BELL'S LUXURIOUS EASY-CHAIRS AND SAID WITH A KIND OF TREMBLING EARNESTNESS
YOU KNOW PAPA YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY I WAS GETTING FANCIFUL I HOPE AND TRUST YOU ARE
I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE MY DEED OF RESIGNATION AND WAIT UPON THE BISHOP MYSELF TO BID HIM FAREWELL
SHE SLOWLY MOVED HER HEAD ROUND ON THE PILLOW AND SMILED AT HER CHILDREN AS SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHY IT WAS DONE
MARGARET TOSSED THE NOTE TO HER FATHER
MARGARET LAID HER HAND ON HIS ARM
I CAN'T MATCH HER YET
AND RIGHT BEFORE IT STOOD AN IMMEMORIAL LIME-TREE BENCHED ALL ROUND IN SOME HIDDEN RECESSES OF WHOSE LEAFY WEALTH HUNG THE GRIM ESCUTCHEON OF THE LENNARDS
MARGARET FLEW UPSTAIRS AS SOON AS THEIR VISITORS WERE GONE AND PUT ON HER BONNET AND SHAWL TO RUN AND INQUIRE HOW BESSY HIGGINS WAS AND SIT WITH HER AS LONG AS SHE COULD BEFORE DINNER
BUT WHAT IF LEONARDS RECOGNISED HER AS FREDERICK'S COMPANION
I ONLY HEAR OF MISS HALE NOW AS MY LANDLORD AND THROUGH HER LAWYER HE BROKE OFF FROM HIGGINS TO FOLLOW THE BUSINESS ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN BENT WHEN THE LATTER FIRST ACCOSTED HIM
HE CALLED HIS SISTER
A LARGE INDIAN SHAWL WHICH HUNG ABOUT HER IN LONG HEAVY FOLDS AND WHICH SHE WORE AS AN EMPRESS WEARS HER DRAPERY
PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT--OH YES
WE HAVE NO HORSE NOT EVEN FOR PAPA
JOHN
JOHN
THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT WEDDING DRESSES AND WEDDING CEREMONIES
THE FIRST PAROXYSM HAD PASSED OVER AND NOW HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING BEEN SO BATTERED DOWN BY EMOTION
WHAT DO YOU WANT MR HIGGINS
THEY HOWEVER REMEMBERED HIS STARTING UP AND CURSING HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING SOONER THOUGHT OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH FOR SOME PURPOSE UNKNOWN
HIS FACE PALE WITH REPRESSED EXCITEMENT
I SHALL BE MERRIER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN NOW I HAVE GOT MY OWN WAY AND YOU'LL NOT GO A FIGURE BUT LET ME BUY YOUR DRESSES FOR YOU INDEED I MEAN TO BUY THEM FOR MYSELF
AND DISTINGUISH MANY A WELL-KNOWN LINE THROUGH THE LEAVES
IT WILL BE BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO HER ANY WAY THAN THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE SPOKEN TO AT ALL.--OH
I WILL GO PRAY MA'AM LET ME SEND ONE OF THE POLICE
HOO'LL BE BETTER ABLE TO TALK TO-MORROW SIR SAID THE NEIGHBOUR
HE WENT WI HIS MEALY-MOUTHED FACE THAT TURNS ME SICK TO LOOK AT A-ASKING FOR WORK THOUGH HE KNOWED WELL ENOUGH THE NEW RULE O PLEDGING THEMSELVES TO GIVE NOUGHT TO TH UNIONS
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MR THORNTON
IF SHE HAD NOT SHOWN YOU EVERY CHANGE WITH SUCH EVIDENT EXULTATION IN THEIR SUPERIOR SENSE IN PERCEIVING WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT THIS AND THAT WOULD BE I COULD HAVE BEHAVED WELL
BUT WE ARE TAUGHT BY MR MILSOME TO CALL A AN--WHO CAN REMEMBER AN ADJECTIVE ABSOLUTE SAID HALF-A-DOZEN VOICES AT ONCE
WHEN WERE YOU THERE I WANTED TO SEE THE PLACE WHERE MARGARET GREW TO WHAT SHE IS EVEN AT THE WORST TIME OF ALL WHEN I HAD NO HOPE OF EVER CALLING HER MINE
SHE KNEW FROM THE SURPRISED EXPRESSION ON DIXON'S FACE HOW RIDICULOUSLY GRAND SHE HERSELF MUST BE LOOKING
IT HAD BEEN THE TONE WITH HER AUNT AND COUSIN TO SPEAK OF MILTON WITH DISLIKE AND CONTEMPT
HALF-CONQUERED HALF-RESENTING
HE NEVER LIKED YOUR MARRYING MR HALE BUT IF HE COULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE COME TO THIS HE WOULD HAVE SWORN WORSE OATHS THAN EVER IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE DIXON HAD BEEN SO MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO COMMENT UPON MR HALE'S PROCEEDINGS TO HER MISTRESS WHO LISTENED TO HER OR NOT AS SHE WAS IN THE HUMOUR THAT SHE NEVER NOTICED MARGARET'S FLASHING EYE AND DILATING NOSTRIL
SERIOUSLY OLD FRIEND YOUR DAUGHTER SHALL BE MY PRINCIPAL CHARGE IN LIFE AND ALL THE HELP THAT EITHER MY WIT OR MY WISDOM OR MY WILLING HEART CAN GIVE SHALL BE HERS
IT WERE NOT MUCH TO BE SURE
IN OUR INFANCY WE REQUIRE A WISE DESPOTISM TO GOVERN US
THAT HE WOULD LOVE HER
BUT WE WILL ASK MRS THORNTON IF SHE CAN TELL US OF A GOOD DOCTOR
I RECKON HE'LL WANT A THE COMFORT HE CAN GET OUT O EITHER PIPE OR DRINK AFORE HE'S DONE HER FATHER WENT OUT OF DOORS EVIDENTLY TO FINISH HIS PIPE
FOR SHE SAW IN AN INSTANT THE WEIGHT OF CARE AND ANXIETY WHICH HE COULD NOT SHAKE OFF ALTHOUGH HIS GUESTS RECEIVED FROM HIM A GREETING THAT APPEARED BOTH CHEERFUL AND CORDIAL
HE DID NOT SPEAK READILY
BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW
SO HAVING DISTURBED YOUR NIGHT'S REST AS I CAN SEE WITH MY UNTIMELY FANCIES I'LL BETAKE MYSELF WITH AN EASY MIND TO MY OWN BUT MR HALE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY ANY SUCH NONSENSICAL IDEA
MRS BOUCHER WAS SITTING IN A ROCKING-CHAIR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ILL-REDD-UP FIREPLACE
CALL JOHN FANNY,--CALL HIM IN FROM THE MILL
NAMELY THAT YOU ARE TO PAY THEM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR AS LONG AS YOU AND THEY FIND IT PLEASANT TO LIVE TOGETHER
I THOUGHT HE'D HAD MORE PLUCK
SLACK OF WORK IT IS A PROVINCIALISM
SO MARGARET GAINED THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HER RIGHT TO FOLLOW HER OWN IDEAS OF DUTY
I CAN SEE SHE'S GIVEN HERSELF AIRS TO YOU AS WELL AS IF YOU'D TOLD ME OUT AND IF SHE HAS SAID HE--AND THEN HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT--THEN WENT ON
AND BESIDES HIS PASSIONATE REFUSAL TO ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF FEAR ALMOST INSPIRED MARGARET HERSELF WITH HOPE
I WISH I COULD FIND SOMEBODY FOR YOU TO MARRY HERE THAT I COULD BE SURE OF YOU I SHALL NEVER MARRY NONSENSE AND DOUBLE NONSENSE
WHILE NEWTON WENT NOT WITHOUT A MUTTERED GRUMBLING TO UNDO THE SHAWLS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN EXHIBITED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THAT DAY MARGARET LOOKED ROUND UPON THE NURSERY
THOUGH I DON'T RECOLLECT IF HE WAS THERE AT THE MUTINY DID HE KNOW YOU SAID MARGARET EAGERLY
NOTHING BUT CHAOS AND NIGHT SURROUNDED THE ONE LURID FACT THAT IN MR THORNTON'S EYES SHE WAS DEGRADED
AND HER FATHER WAS RATHER TAKEN ABACK BY THE IDEA OF THE DRUNKEN WEAVER AWAITING HIM IN HIS QUIET STUDY WITH WHOM HE WAS EXPECTED TO DRINK TEA AND ON WHOSE BEHALF MARGARET WAS ANXIOUSLY PLEADING
WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HIS MIND MARGARET CLUNG TO THE DOORPOST TO STEADY HERSELF
AY SOOTH WE FEEL TOO STRONG IN WEAL TO NEED THEE ON THAT ROAD
YES REPLIED MR BELL
AND THAT I SHALL DO NOW IF I NE'ER DID AFORE THAT YOU MAY HAVE MORE MONEY LAID UP FOR ANOTHER STRIKE I SUPPOSE NO
AND WE'LL KEEP HIM SNUG DEPEND UPON IT
HOW SAD HE LOOKS
ONE MAY BE CLOGGED WITH HONEY AND UNABLE TO RISE AND FLY YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID MARGARET ROUSED BY THE ASPERSION ON HER BELOVED SOUTH TO A FOND VEHEMENCE OF DEFENCE THAT BROUGHT THE COLOUR INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE ANGRY TEARS INTO HER EYES
HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE DINING-ROOM WISHING THAT HIS MOTHER WOULD ORDER CANDLES AND ALLOW HIM TO SET TO WORK AT EITHER READING OR WRITING AND SO PUT A STOP TO THE CONVERSATION
BUT PUSHING THEM ASIDE AND STRETCHING A LITTLE OUT SHE COULD SEE THE TOPS OF THE PARSONAGE CHIMNEYS ABOVE THE TREES
IT WAS THE OPENING OF THIS STREET FROM A LANE INTO A GREAT THOROUGHFARE THIRTY YEARS AGO WHICH HAS CAUSED HIS PROPERTY TO RISE SO MUCH IN VALUE
MARGARET STOOD RIGHT UNDER THE CHANDELIER QUITE SILENT AND PASSIVE WHILE HER AUNT ADJUSTED THE DRAPERIES
DISCORDANT AS IT WAS--WITH ALMOST A DETESTATION FOR ALL SHE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE MANUFACTURERS THE PEOPLE THE WILD AND BLEAK COUNTRY--THERE WAS THIS ONE RECOMMENDATION--IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE AND COULD NEVER REMIND THEM OF THAT BELOVED PLACE
I CAN LAUGH AT IT TO BE SURE
YOU KNOW I NEVER SAW HIM BUT ONCE AND THEN WE WERE SO PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO EACH OTHER THAT WE DID NOT GET ON PARTICULARLY WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WOULD EVER LIKE HIM OR THINK HIM AGREEABLE MARGARET
BUT THE WIND WAS IN THE EAST
I CANNOT PRAY TILL I HAVE THIS ONE THING
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT BETSY
HE HAD NOT LOVED HER WITHOUT GAINING THAT INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT CAPABILITIES WERE IN HER
SHALL YOU RIDE DRIVE OR WALK WALK DECIDEDLY
HE AND MANY ANOTHER,--ALL HAMPER'S MEN,--AND MANY A ONE BESIDES
I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE IT OUT WITH THAT YOUNG FELLOW
IF IT'S NO OFFENCE I'LL ASK YO A QUESTION OR TWO IN MY TURN YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME SAID MR HALE
WHAT COULD SHE DO NEXT
SHE NEEDS CARE HE SAYS
YOU BELIEVE HE IS HER LOVER I SUPPOSE--YOU AGREE TO THAT HE TURNED ROUND TO HIS MOTHER
GREAT ALABASTER GROUPS OCCUPIED EVERY FLAT SURFACE SAFE FROM DUST UNDER THEIR GLASS SHADES
IN MR THORNTON'S HOUSE AT THIS VERY SAME TIME A SIMILAR YET DIFFERENT SCENE WAS GOING ON
SHE HAD A NERVOUS LITTLE COUGH WHENEVER SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
CAPTAIN LENNOX FELL ASLEEP ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME
AND MARGARET SUDDENLY FELT HOW HER SPEECH MIGHT BE MISUNDERSTOOD BY HIM
SHE'S NOT FOR STAYING WITH US A DAY LONGER NOR SHE CAN HELP
NEVER AT HAND WHEN THEY'RE WANTED ON THE CONTRARY I SAW THREE OR FOUR OF THEM WHEN THE GATES GAVE WAY STRUGGLING AND BEATING ABOUT IN FINE FASHION
MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
AND THEN BENT SO EAGERLY FORWARD TO LISTEN
MR HALE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE
EVERYTHING WAS DONE PROPERLY EVEN TO THE PAYING
BUT WE MUST HAVE HAD MR HORSFALL AND HE DOES NOT STAY IN MILTON LONG
BUT MR THORNTON--WHY DID SHE TREMBLE AND HIDE HER FACE IN THE PILLOW
MARGARET FELT SURE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE THE GREATER FREEDOM OF BREATHING WHICH A MORE SITTING POSTURE WOULD PROCURE
IT'LL STICK HERE I THIS MAN'S THROAT AND THERE I T'OTHER'S
I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS
YOU ARE REGULAR WORSHIPPERS OF THOR IF WE DO NOT REVERENCE THE PAST AS YOU DO IN OXFORD IT IS BECAUSE WE WANT SOMETHING WHICH CAN APPLY TO THE PRESENT MORE DIRECTLY
OH MAMMA DON'T CRY SO PITIFULLY,--IT CUTS ME TO THE HEART MRS HALE COULD NOT STOP HER TEARS
WHAT ELSE DOES SHE WANT TO BRING HER UP TO YOUR STANDARD NAY
THAT'LL DO SAID BESSY FALLING BACK IN HER CHAIR
DID IT EVER STRIKE YOU THAT THORNTON AND YOUR DAUGHTER HAVE WHAT THE FRENCH CALL A TENDRESSE FOR EACH OTHER NEVER SAID MR HALE FIRST STARTLED AND THEN FLURRIED BY THE NEW IDEA
BECAUSE THERE I CAN EARN BREAD FOR MY FAMILY
BE EASY MAMMA YOU SHALL SEE HIM AS FAR AS ANYTHING EARTHLY CAN BE PROMISED YOU WILL WRITE TO-NIGHT
I HAVE HAD OTHER WORK TO DO AND OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE NOW THEN IT IS ENDED SAID MARGARET
PAPA'S LIVING IS VERY SMALL
BARBOUR AND CO
HE CAME CLOSE TO THE TABLE AND STOOD STILL THERE WAITING TILL SHE SHOULD HAVE FINISHED THE PARAGRAPH WHICH APPARENTLY ABSORBED HER
OH MARGARET IT WAS SO WINDY LAST NIGHT
YES I SUPPOSE I MUST
I CANNOT THINK HOW IT MUST BE MANAGED
THERE WAS A STRANGE UNSATISFIED VACUUM IN MARGARET'S HEART AND MODE OF LIFE
BUT HE SAYS HIS LAST WORDS WERE TO ASK HOW MISS HALE WAS ME SAID MARGARET DRAWING HERSELF UP
I WOULD RATHER NOT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF YOU HADN'T COME IN
ALL THE NEXT DAY THEY SATE TOGETHER--THEY THREE
NO OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES HAD ROUSED HER OUT OF THE TRANCE OF THOUGHT IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PLUNGED BY HIS LAST WORDS AND BY THE LOOK OF HIS DEEP INTENT PASSIONATE EYES AS THEIR FLAMES HAD MADE HER OWN FALL BEFORE THEM
I RECKON MY DINNER HOUR STRETCHES ALL O'ER THE DAY
ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENTLEMEN IT WAS IMMEDIATELY PUT ASIDE
THAT IF HER FATHER BEGAN TO SPEAK EVER SO MILDLY ON THE SUBJECT OF HIGGINS'S THOUGHTS THE LATTER WOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF CHALLENGED TO AN ARGUMENT AND WOULD FEEL HIMSELF BOUND TO MAINTAIN HIS OWN GROUND
I ASSURE YOU I HEARD IT SPOKEN OF WITH GREAT INTEREST--CURIOSITY AS TO ITS RESULT PERHAPS I SHOULD RATHER SAY
THEY'LL FIND THEMSELVES MISTAKEN THIS TIME I FANCY,--A LITTLE OUT OF THEIR RECKONING
BESIDES SHE WENT ON FATHER IS SURE AND POSITIVE THE MASTERS MUST GIVE IN WITHIN THESE NEXT FEW DAYS,--THAT THEY CANNA HOULD ON MUCH LONGER
I SHOULD HAVE HESITATED TILL PERHAPS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO DO ANY GOOD
HE'LL BE AFTER THE MEN'S CANS IN THE HAY-FIELD AND PEEPING IN
CARELESS TO ABSTEMIOUSNESS IN HER DAILY HABITS IT WAS PART OF HER PRIDE TO SET A FEAST BEFORE SUCH OF HER GUESTS AS CARED FOR IT
IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
IT WAS NOT A FAVOURABLE HOUR FOR HIGGINS TO MAKE HIS REQUEST
ON THE OPPOSITE AN IMMENSE MANY-WINDOWED MILL WHENCE PROCEEDED THE CONTINUAL CLANK OF MACHINERY AND THE LONG GROANING ROAR OF THE STEAM-ENGINE ENOUGH TO DEAFEN THOSE WHO LIVED WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE
IF NO ONE ELSE IN MILTON REMEMBERS ME I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL
VERY NEARLY DARK
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT ASKED MR BELL COMING TO THE WINDOW AND STANDING BEHIND MARGARET
AND SHE WENT STEADILY ON THROUGH ALL THAT CHAPTER OF UNSPEAKABLE CONSOLATION
IF HE RETURNED AS HE HAD HALF THREATENED IN A FEW HOURS WHY
WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
I THINK THE MESSENGER WHO BROUGHT THE BOOK LAST NIGHT MUST HAVE HAD SOME NOTE AND FORGOT TO DELIVER IT
HE TRIED NOT TO BE BUT WAS CONVINCED THAT ALL THAT HIGGINS HAD SAID WAS TRUE
SHE PLANNED AND PROMISED AND LED HER MOTHER ON TO ARRANGE FULLY AS MUCH AS COULD BE FIXED BEFORE THEY KNEW SOMEWHAT MORE DEFINITIVELY WHAT MR HALE INTENDED TO DO
THEM RABBLE MAY BE ALL ABOUT
MR BELL WAS STUNNED BY THE SHOCK
SHE WAS PROUD OF SERVING FREDERICK
THAT SUGGESTED THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD POSSIBLY BEEN INFLUENCED SO TO DO WITH A VIEW OF SPARING HER THE REPETITION OF HER DENIAL
MANY A ONE WHO NEVER READS NOR THINKS EITHER GETS TO BE RECTOR AND DEAN AND WHAT NOT
SHE WONDERED HOW HER FATHER AND HIGGINS HAD GOT ON
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE TO HER
BRIGHTLY
THAT MAN HAS IT IN HIM TO BE BURNT AT THE STAKE AFORE HE'LL GIVE IN
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT ME MISS HALE
TELL ME HAS YOUR FATHER TURNED OUT AY SAID BESSY HEAVILY--IN A MANNER VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN IN BUT A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE
MR THORNTON SAW HER BEAUTIFUL EYES LIFTED TO HER FATHER FULL OF LIGHT HALF-LAUGHTER AND HALF-LOVE AS THIS BIT OF PANTOMIME WENT ON BETWEEN THE TWO UNOBSERVED AS THEY FANCIED BY ANY
HER STEP GREW LIGHTER HER LIP REDDER
BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF
PERCEIVING THAT MARGARET WAS AWAKE SHE CAME FORWARDS WITH A LETTER
WHEN SHE WAS CIVILLY HELPED INTO A CARRIAGE BY A PORTER INTO WHOSE FACE SHE DURST NOT LOOK TILL THEY WERE IN MOTION AND THEN SHE SAW THAT IT WAS NOT LEONARDS CHAPTER XXXIII PEACE SLEEP ON MY LOVE IN THY COLD BED NEVER TO BE DISQUIETED
HAVE YOU TOLD FREDERICK ASKED SHE
I'D PROMISE YO MEASTER I'D NOT SPEAK A WORD AS COULD DO HARM IF SO BE YO DID RIGHT BY US
THE WHOLE APARTMENT WAS SMALLER AND SHABBIER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED AS BACK-GROUND AND FRAME-WORK FOR MARGARET HERSELF SO QUEENLY
HER MOTHER REALLY TRIED TO SYMPATHISE WITH HER BUT COULD NOT
AND SO HE RETURNED TO THE LITTLE MARKET-PLACE AND REMOUNTED THE OMNIBUS TO RETURN TO MILTON
SHOULD NOT YOU GO AND SEE NURSE
BUT IT IS HARD MOTHER
PROMISED TO ASK FOR AN INFIRMARY ORDER FOR HER
HE WAS THERE AND MARY TOO
TAKE A WALK BEFORE LUNCH GO A DRIVE WITH YOUR AUNT AFTER AND HAVE SOME KIND OF ENGAGEMENT IN THE EVENING
THE DAYS OF EATING FRUIT SO PRIMITIVELY AS YOU DESCRIBE ARE OVER WITH ME
BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT EVEN THEN HE WAS HIMSELF INCLINED TO GIVE UP THE FORM OF RELIGION INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN BAPTISED ONLY THAT HIS OPINIONS WERE TENDING IN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THOSE OF HIS FATHER
WHEN I SEE MEN VIOLENT AND OBSTINATE IN PURSUIT OF THEIR RIGHTS I MAY SAFELY INFER THAT THE MASTER IS THE SAME THAT HE IS A LITTLE IGNORANT OF THAT SPIRIT WHICH SUFFERETH LONG AND IS KIND AND SEEKETH NOT HER OWN YOU ARE JUST LIKE ALL STRANGERS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WORKING OF OUR SYSTEM MISS HALE SAID HE HASTILY
MR BELL BLEW HIS NOSE BUT OTHERWISE HE ALSO KEPT SILENCE
AND BY-AND-BYE HE LOST ALL SENSE OF RESENTMENT IN WONDER HOW IT WAS OR COULD BE THAT TWO MEN LIKE HIMSELF AND HIGGINS LIVING BY THE SAME TRADE WORKING IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS AT THE SAME OBJECT COULD LOOK UPON EACH OTHER'S POSITION AND DUTIES IN SO STRANGELY DIFFERENT A WAY
IT WAS SOMETHING OF A TRIAL TO MARGARET TO GO OUT BY HERSELF IN THIS BUSY BUSTLING PLACE
I CAN'T BEAR TO THINK OF YOUR LONELY POSITION IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO MY FATHER
SHE WAS MENDING A LARGE LONG TABLE-CLOTH OF THE FINEST TEXTURE HOLDING IT UP AGAINST THE LIGHT OCCASIONALLY TO DISCOVER THIN PLACES WHICH REQUIRED HER DELICATE CARE
YOU SEE SIR THERE IS LIKE TO BE A CORONER'S INQUEST
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE JUST GIVEN WAY TO WIFE AND DAUGHTER AS MUCH AS MOST MEN AND AS TO MR THORNTON SAID MR HALE I'LL GIVE YOU A NOTE TO HIM WHICH I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO SAY WILL ENSURE YOU A HEARING I THANK YO KINDLY SIR BUT I'D AS LIEF STAND ON MY OWN BOTTOM
FATHER WERE STUNNED WI THE BLOW AT FIRST FOR ALL BOUCHER WERE WEAK WI PASSION AND WI CLEMMING
TOWARDS EVENING HE SAID
I KNOW SHE CARES FOR MY BROTHER
ONLY IT WAS NOT BOUCHER THAT THREW THE STONE
BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK
AND HE WISHES TO GIVE UP HIS LEASE OH
AND NO SOUND BROKE THE SILENCE
OLD SIMON'S RHEUMATISM MIGHT BE BAD AND HIS EYESIGHT WORSE
EVEN HER GREAT BEAUTY IS BLOTTED OUT OF ONE'S MEMORY BY HER SCORNFUL WAYS CHAPTER XI FIRST IMPRESSIONS THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD
HE STOOD UP AND FACED THE DOOR SHOWING SUCH A STRANGE SUDDEN ANXIETY TO CONCEAL FREDERICK FROM THE SIGHT OF ANY PERSON ENTERING EVEN THOUGH IT WERE THE FAITHFUL DIXON THAT A SHIVER CAME OVER MARGARET'S HEART
BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE ALTERED IN THE LEAST HADN'T YOU BETTER LET DIXON SEE IT
THE MEN SPOKE TOGETHER AND THEN ONE OF THEM CAME UP TO HIGGINS WHO WOULD HAVE FAIN SHRUNK BACK INTO HIS HOUSE
THE YOUNG SPANIARD WAS SO EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO MAKE A FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION UPON HER LOVER'S ENGLISH RELATIONS THAT HER FEMININE CARE PEEPED OUT AT EVERY ERASURE
AND THE OFFERED HAND WAS TAKEN WITH A RESOLUTE CALMNESS AND DROPPED AS CARELESSLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN A DEAD AND WITHERED FLOWER
MR HALE HAD RECEIVED SEVERAL LETTERS FROM MR BELL AND ONE OR TWO FROM MR THORNTON AND HE WAS ANXIOUS TO ASCERTAIN AT ONCE A GOOD MANY PARTICULARS RESPECTING HIS POSITION AND CHANCES OF SUCCESS THERE WHICH HE COULD ONLY DO BY AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LATTER GENTLEMAN
THE WORDS WERE LOST IN THE FAR SMALLER POINT OF SOUND THAT MAGNIFIED ITSELF TO HER FEARS AND FILLED HER BRAIN
OR YOU CAN SEND A LIST AFTERWARDS
NOW I CALL THAT TREACHEROUS SAID SHE
HE HAS BEEN MOST KIND
IT SHOWED THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS
I DARE SAY IT WAS ALL FOR THE BEST ONLY I HAD NO CONCEPTION OF HOW YOU WERE LIVING
BUT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN TEN YEARS AMONG A PEOPLE WHO ARE ALWAYS OWING THEIR BETTERS A GRUDGE AND ONLY WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY IT OFF YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE A COWARD OR NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT MR THORNTON CAME THAT EVENING TO MR HALE'S
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING
BUT THOSE WHO LOOKED AT IT ONCE GENERALLY LOOKED AT IT AGAIN
THE HOUSE TEEMED WITH COMFORT NOW COMPARED TO WHAT IT HAD DONE
THE ANXIOUS TERROR IN WHICH MR HALE LIVED LEST HIS SON SHOULD BE DETECTED AND CAPTURED FAR OUT-WEIGHED THE PLEASURE HE DERIVED FROM HIS PRESENCE
I WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER TO FIND FROM WHAT MR HORSFALL SAID THAT THERE WERE OTHERS WHO THOUGHT IN SO DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE A MANNER AS THE MR MORISON HE SPOKE ABOUT
ASK SOME OF YOUR MASTERS
BUT I KNOWED IT I AM SORRY I ASKED YOU
NOW IN MR THORNTON'S FACE THE STRAIGHT BROWS FELL LOW OVER THE CLEAR DEEP-SET EARNEST EYES WHICH WITHOUT BEING UNPLEASANTLY SHARP SEEMED INTENT ENOUGH TO PENETRATE INTO THE VERY HEART AND CORE OF WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
WE'VE NEVER CEASED TO BE SORRY THAT HE LEFT MARGARET TRIED TO SPEAK AND TELL HER OF HER FATHER'S DEATH
SPEAK FOR HE SAW HER LIPS QUIVERING ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO CRY
I HOPE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME FOR DOING WHAT IS ONLY MY DUTY ALTHOUGH IT MAY APPEAR IMPERTINENT MARGARET BOWED HER HEAD AS HE WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR
MR THORNTON AND MR HALE WERE BOTH ABSORBED IN THE CONTINUATION OF SOME SUBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN STARTED AT THEIR LAST MEETING
EVEN MR BELL'S VISIT BROUGHT HIS TENANT'S NAME UPON THE TAPIS
STILL SOMEHOW ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO HAVE SUNK SO LOW IN--IN A FRIEND'S OPINION AS I HAVE DONE IN HIS HER EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS BUT HER VOICE WAS STEADY AND MR BELL WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
IT'S A VERY UNLIKELY STORY AT ANY RATE
DO YOU KNOW THE NEW FOREST AT ALL YES VERY SHORTLY THEN YOU CAN FANCY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND MILTON
BUT THEM LADIES DRESS SO GRAND SAID BESSY WITH AN ANXIOUS LOOK AT MARGARET'S PRINT GOWN WHICH HER MILTON EYES APPRAISED AT SEVENPENCE A YARD
HOW UNSUBSTANTIAL AND FLICKERING AND FLITTING
HER FULL BEAUTY MET HIS EYE
DO YOU KNOW MARGARET I WAS VERY NEARLY GIVING BOTH DIXON AND MYSELF A GOOD FRIGHT THIS AFTERNOON
SHE WAS MUCH WORSE
HE HAD NEVER THE GRACE TO ASK WHERE I WAS STAYING
DON'T BE AFRAID SHE SAID COLDLY
I NEVER SAW HIM I THINK
BUT SHE WAS TOO LANGUID TO CARE ABOUT ANY MR BELL EVEN THOUGH HE WERE TWENTY TIMES HER GODFATHER
ARE YOU BETTER MY DEAR AS MARGARET OPENED HER FILMY EYES AND GAZED DREAMILY AT HER
IT IS A TRUE REAL AGONY
BUT I COULD NOT SEE HIM
CHAPTER VIII HOME SICKNESS AND IT'S HAME HAME
NAY NOW WE'LL NOT TALK OF IT IF IT ENDS IN THIS WAY
SHE'S BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS WITH HER DREAMS AND HER METHODEE FANCIES AND HER VISIONS OF CITIES WITH GOULDEN GATES AND PRECIOUS STONES
THE ONLY THING TO BE FEARED WAS LEST LEONARDS SHOULD IN SOME WAY BORROW MONEY ENOUGH TO EFFECT HIS PURPOSE OF FOLLOWING FREDERICK TO LONDON AND HUNTING HIM OUT THERE
SHE FOUND THAT THE CHILDREN WERE TRUER AND SIMPLER MOURNERS THAN THE WIDOW
HE MEANS WELL AS I TELLED YO YESTERDAY AND TELL YO AGAIN AND AGAIN
MARGARET MIGHT BE ASSURED HE WOULD TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION AGAINST BEING TRACKED BY LEONARDS
MOTHER SAID HE STOPPING AND BRAVELY SPEAKING OUT THE TRUTH I WISH YOU WOULD LIKE MISS HALE WHY ASKED SHE STARTLED BY HIS EARNEST YET TENDER MANNER
AS THEIR OWN ENEMIES CERTAINLY SAID HE QUICKLY NOT A LITTLE PIQUED BY THE HAUGHTY DISAPPROVAL HER FORM OF EXPRESSION AND TONE OF SPEAKING IMPLIED
WOULD A BOTTLE OF THAT DO HER GOOD THINK YOU NO MAMMA
THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MR HALE
BUT A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HER MOTHER'S DELICATE HEALTH AND POSITIVE DISLIKE TO HELSTONE ALL DATED FROM THE TIME OF THE MUTINY IN WHICH FREDERICK HAD BEEN ENGAGED,--THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION,--MADE HER PAUSE AND TURN AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT EACH TIME SHE APPROACHED IT
THIS IS REALLY TERRIBLE SAID HE GOING UP TO THE WINDOW
IT RELATED TO A FEELING WHICH I DO NOT THINK YOU WOULD SHARE WON'T YOU TRY ME PLEADED HE
I DECLINE EVERY ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY MYSELF FOR ANYTHING
DO YOU THINK SAID MRS HALE AFTER A PAUSE THAT YOU COULD GO AND ASK MRS THORNTON TO COME AND SEE ME
WHEN ALL WAS READY MARGARET OPENED THE STUDY DOOR AND WENT IN LIKE A SERVING-MAIDEN WITH A HEAVY TRAY HELD IN HER EXTENDED ARMS
AND HE RESOLUTELY AVOIDED EVEN LOOKING NEAR HER AGAIN DURING DINNER
HOO'S NEVER LOOKED UP SIN HE WERE BORN AND HOO LOVES HIM AS IF HE WERE HER VERY LIFE,--AS HE IS,--FOR I RECKON HE'LL HA COST ME THAT PRECIOUS PRICE,--OUR LILE JACK WHO WAKENED ME EACH MORN WI PUTTING HIS SWEET LITTLE LIPS TO MY GREAT ROUGH FOU FACE A-SEEKING A SMOOTH PLACE TO KISS,--AN HE LIES CLEMMING HERE THE DEEP SOBS CHOKED THE POOR MAN AND NICHOLAS LOOKED UP WITH EYES BRIMFUL OF TEARS TO MARGARET BEFORE HE COULD GAIN COURAGE TO SPEAK
AS IT IS I AM ALWAYS AFRAID OF HER GOING OFF TO CADIZ I WILL TRY WHEN I MARRY TO LOOK OUT FOR A YOUNG LADY WHO HAS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN
BUT IT WAS ONLY HERE AND THERE THAT THE NAME CAME IN OR ANY MILTON NAME INDEED
MISS HALE LOOKS WELL MA'AM,--DOESN'T SHE
HE'S FAIRLY KNOCKED DOWN IN HIS MIND BY IT
IF YOU PLEASE AND IF YOU CAN IF THERE IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY DON'T FORCE AN EXPLANATION UPON HIM PRAY BUT IF YOU CAN WILL YOU TELL HIM THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND TELL HIM ALSO THAT I GAVE YOU LEAVE TO DO SO BECAUSE I FELT THAT FOR PAPA'S SAKE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO LOSE HIS RESPECT THOUGH WE MAY NEVER BE LIKELY TO MEET AGAIN CERTAINLY
AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT
BUT POOR BABY WAS TAKEN ILL AT OXENHAM WITH HIS TEETHING
NOW I WILL THINK OF IT--NOW I WILL REMEMBER IT ALL
SHE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO LIKE POOR MASTER FREDERICK
OH DIXON
OH DIXON
AND SHE HAD DOUBLY ENJOYED THE FREE WALKS AND RAMBLES OF HER FOREST LIFE FROM THE CONTRAST WHICH THEY PRESENTED
WE KNOWN WHEN WE'RE PUT UPON
MR HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE
IT WAS WELL THAT HAVING MADE THE ROUND OF THE GARDEN THEY CAME SUDDENLY UPON MR HALE WHOSE WHEREABOUTS HAD BEEN QUITE FORGOTTEN BY THEM
AS MARGARET REMEMBERED HER FEELINGS YESTERDAY SHE SAID TO HERSELF
THE CROWD HAD SURROUNDED THE OUTBUILDINGS AT THE REAR AND WERE SENDING FORTH THEIR AWFUL THREATENING ROAR BEHIND
AND SEEING YOU COME OUT OF THE VERY HOUSE SIR I THOUGHT I MIGHT MAKE BOLD TO ASK IF--YOU SEE IT'S ALWAYS AWKWARD HAVING TO DO WITH CASES OF DISPUTED IDENTITY AND ONE DOESN'T LIKE TO DOUBT THE WORD OF A RESPECTABLE YOUNG WOMAN UNLESS ONE HAS STRONG PROOF TO THE CONTRARY AND SHE DENIED HAVING BEEN AT THE STATION THAT EVENING REPEATED MR THORNTON IN A LOW BROODING TONE
THEN I WILL ONLY SEE IF THERE IS ANY NOTE OR LETTER FOR ME FROM MR THORNTON WHO SAID HE WOULD LET ME KNOW ANYTHING HE MIGHT HEAR ABOUT THESE HOUSES AND THEN WE WILL SET OFF
MR THORNTON WOULD NOT ASK AGAIN
SHE WOULD HA THOUGHT IT A GREAT COMPLIMENT I KNOW MARGARET SHRANK A LITTLE FROM ANSWERING
THE THING VEXING ME YOU SEE IS THAT I WANTED TO TAKE HER FOR A CHILD OF MY OWN
TILL MORNING SHE MIGHT FEEL ILL AND WEARY
MISERABLE UNRESTING NIGHT
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THEM TO BE SUCH
BEFORE THE MORNING CAME ALL WAS OVER
GOD FORGIVE ME HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF-REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON
EDITH
IT LOOKED AS IF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED FOR DAYS BY ANY EFFORT AT CLEANLINESS
GIVE THE BASKET TO ME,--I'LL TAKE IT IT TOOK UP BOTH HIS HANDS TO CARRY IT
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I WISH YOU WOULD
I RECOLLECT BUT HE DID NOT SAY THE NAME
AND THIS SLIGHT ALL-PERVADING INSTABILITY HAD GIVEN HER GREATER PAIN THAN IF ALL HAD BEEN TOO ENTIRELY CHANGED FOR HER TO RECOGNISE IT
SERIOUSLY HALE
DAMN HIM
IF I SAVED ONE BLOW ONE CRUEL ANGRY ACTION THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED I DID A WOMAN'S WORK
AND SHE AND MRS SHAW CONSULTED AS TO THE DESIRABLENESS OF DELAYING THE MORROW'S JOURNEY
BUT WE MILTON MASTERS HAVE TO-DAY SENT IN OUR DECISION
DUN YO KNOW THAT MISS
HER MOTHER PRATTLED WITH DIXON AND SEEMED TO HAVE UTTERLY FORGOTTEN THE POSSIBILITY OF FREDERICK BEING TRIED AND EXECUTED--UTTERLY FORGOTTEN THAT AT HER WISH IF BY MARGARET'S DEED HE WAS SUMMONED INTO THIS DANGER
WELL GOOD NIGHT SIR
MARGARET WAS PROUD OF HER FATHER
BECAUSE A MAN WAS SUCCESSFUL IN HIS VENTURES THERE WAS NO REASON THAT IN ALL OTHER THINGS HIS MIND SHOULD BE WELL-BALANCED
SHE COULD ONLY LOOK UPON IT AS IT AFFECTED HERSELF
HE HAS BEEN THE VERY MAN TO GIVE COLTHURST ALL THE FACTS HE WANTED COACHING IN
BUT THOSE HOURS PAST OUR RELATION CEASES
I SHALL NOT GET WELL HERE
DON'T BE AFRAID OF TELLING ME YOUR FANCIES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM RIGHT UNDER THE BAGGED-UP CHANDELIER WAS A LARGE CIRCULAR TABLE WITH SMARTLY-BOUND BOOKS ARRANGED AT REGULAR INTERVALS ROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF ITS POLISHED SURFACE LIKE GAILY-COLOURED SPOKES OF A WHEEL
AND WHEN SHE HAD SCHOOLED HERSELF INTO THIS CONVICTION SHE TURNED WITH ALL HER HEART AND STRENGTH TO THE LIFE THAT LAY IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HER AND RESOLVED TO STRIVE AND MAKE THE BEST OF THAT
LOOK WHO IS BOUCHER ASKED MR THORNTON COOLLY AND COMING CLOSE TO THE WINDOW TO DISCOVER THE MAN IN WHOM MARGARET TOOK SUCH AN INTEREST
AND ROSE UP AND WENT HER WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT SEEING A CREATURE
CONSTANTLY AFRAID OF HIS RIGHTS BEING TRENCHED UPON I ONLY STATE THE FACT
AND THEN SHE RECOLLECTED THAT HER MOTHER MUST NOT BE LEFT TO HAVE THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF ENTERTAINING HER VISITOR
THEY SPARE NO EXPENSE THEY SEND OUT SHIPS,--THEY SCOUR THE SEAS TO LAY HOLD OF THE OFFENDERS,--THE LAPSE OF YEARS DOES NOT WASH OUT THE MEMORY OF THE OFFENCE,--IT IS A FRESH AND VIVID CRIME ON THE ADMIRALTY BOOKS TILL IT IS BLOTTED OUT BY BLOOD OH PAPA WHAT HAVE I DONE
MARGARET STILL LOWER WENT THE HEAD
THOSE WHO ARE HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL THEMSELVES ARE TOO APT TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS YOU ARE UNJUST SAID MARGARET GENTLY
WE HAVE FIVE OR SIX EMPTY BED-ROOMS AT HOME WELL AIRED I THINK YOU MAY TRUST MY MOTHER FOR THAT THEN I'LL ONLY RUN UP-STAIRS AND WISH THAT WAN GIRL GOOD-NIGHT AND MAKE MY BOW TO HER AUNT AND GO OFF WITH YOU STRAIGHT MR BELL WAS SOME TIME UP-STAIRS
WHERE CAN HE BE GOING AMONG ALL THESE SHOPS MARGARET STARTED FORWARDS AND AS QUICKLY FELL BACK HALF-SMILING AT HERSELF FOR THE SUDDEN MOTION
BUT NONE IN HIS HOUSEHOLD SAW MR THORNTON AGAIN THAT DAY
AND THAT FRONT ROOM UP-STAIRS WITH THE ATROCIOUS BLUE AND PINK PAPER AND HEAVY CORNICE HAD REALLY A PRETTY VIEW OVER THE PLAIN WITH A GREAT BEND OF RIVER OR CANAL OR WHATEVER IT IS DOWN BELOW
I'LL MANAGE IT
I'M GETTING TO BE A FAMOUS CLEAR-STARCHER
AND THERE SHE AND DIXON WERE PACKING UP CLOTHES AND INTERRUPTING EACH OTHER EVERY NOW AND THEN TO EXCLAIM AT AND TURN OVER WITH FOND REGARD SOME FORGOTTEN TREASURE IN THE SHAPE OF SOME RELIC OF THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE YET LITTLE
THEY WERE TO HOU'D TOGETHER THROUGH THICK AND THIN
MR BELL WAS NO GREAT CORRESPONDENT BUT HE WROTE FROM TIME TO TIME LONG OR SHORT LETTERS AS THE HUMOUR TOOK HIM AND ALTHOUGH MARGARET WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY DEFINITE HOPE ON RECEIVING THEM YET SHE ALWAYS PUT AWAY HIS NOTES WITH A LITTLE FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT
THESE HER MOTHER ALWAYS READ,--FIRST READING A CHAPTER
WE LEAVE TO-MORROW MY SON-IN-LAW COMES THIS EVENING TO ESCORT US SAID MRS SHAW
ONLY AT SOME UNEXPECTED MOT OF MR LENNOX'S HIS FACE FLASHED OUT INTO THE OLD LOOK OF INTENSE ENJOYMENT
BUT YO SEE THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE HIM A BIT BY DAY YET BY NIGHT--WHEN I'M IN A FEVER HALF-ASLEEP AND HALF-AWAKE--IT COMES BACK UPON ME--OH
HOW IS SHE
AT THE TIME THIS FALL DID NOT SEEM OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE
HE LOOKED READY TO STRIKE MARGARET
ANY NIGHT BUT TO-NIGHT
I PRAY GOD TO BLESS YOU
NEARER TO THE TOWN THE AIR HAD A FAINT TASTE AND SMELL OF SMOKE
MARGARET INEXPERIENCED AS SHE WAS IN ALL THE NECESSARY MATTER-OF-FACT BUSINESS TO BE GOT THROUGH DID NOT KNOW TO WHOM TO APPLY FOR ADVICE
I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MRS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
I WISH I'D LETTEN MYSELF BE CHOKED FIRST BUT DOES YOUR FATHER DRINK ASKED MARGARET
HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO BE GOING WITH YOU TO ONE OF THE OLD BARRINGTON ASSEMBLIES,--TAKING YOU AS LADY BERESFORD USED TO TAKE ME MARGARET KISSED HER MOTHER FOR THIS LITTLE BURST OF MATERNAL VANITY
THE LADY HELD OUT A HAND TO MR BELL WITH YOUR FATHER I PRESUME MISS HALE
BUT HE FELT AWKWARD IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION ROUND FROM THIS UNPROMISING BEGINNING
BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIQUITIES OF OXFORD COME NOW BE A SENSIBLE WOMAN
THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS
THAT THE THOUGHT OF HOW HE MUST BE LOOKING UPON HER WITH CONTEMPT STOOD BETWEEN HER AND HER SENSE OF WRONG-DOING
MARGARET TRIED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN WHAT PLEASED HER FATHER
THE EVENINGS ARE GETTING LONGER NOW
MARGARET WENT IN HALF BREATHLESS WITH THE HURRIED STORY SHE HAD TO TELL
HOW YOU CAN HAVE BORNE IT THIS TWO YEARS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHERE COULD I GO TO
BUT MY HOME WAS IN A FOREST
I TELL YOU MOTHER THAT THERE WAS NO INQUEST--NO INQUIRY
MANY A BRIEFLESS BARRISTER MIGHT TWIST HIS CONSCIENCE INTO THINKING THAT HE COULD EARN A HUNDRED POUNDS VERY EASILY BY DOING A GOOD ACTION--IN GIVING ME A CRIMINAL UP TO JUSTICE NONSENSE FREDERICK!--BECAUSE I KNOW A LAWYER ON WHOSE HONOUR I CAN RELY
OR ELSE SHE HAD IN GENERAL PRIDE ENOUGH FOR HER SEX
TELL HIM THAT IT'S THE SMOKE OF MILTON THAT DOES HER HARM
IN THE SUDDENNESS OF THE EVENT MRS SHAW BECAME BEWILDERED AND HYSTERICAL AND SO THE PRECIOUS TIME SLIPPED BY
BUT BECAUSE SHE COULD LISTEN TO SOMETHING LARGER AND GRANDER THAN THE PETTY INTERESTS WHICH THE LADIES HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT
SHE HARDLY ATTENDED TO WHAT MR BELL WAS SAYING
I AM SURE MY DEAR YOU CAN HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE WITH WHOM YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTIMATE TO JUSTIFY YOU IN CALLING UPON THEM SO SOON
SHE QUESTIONED AND CROSS-QUESTIONED EDITH TILL THE LATTER WAS WEARY AND DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO REMEMBER
BUT THIS ONE CONVERSATION MADE THEM PECULIAR PEOPLE TO EACH OTHER
HER UNACCUSTOMED EARS COULD HARDLY CATCH HER FATHER'S VOICE AS THEY STOOD ON THE STEPS AWAITING THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
DID I DO ANY GOOD
SINCE YOUR MAMMA TOLD ME THIS TERRIBLE NEWS WHEN I DRESSED HER FOR TEA I'VE LOST ALL COUNT OF TIME
STILL I SHOULD LIKE HER TO HAVE A WATER-BED
IT SEEMED AS IF IT FASCINATED HIM TO SEE HER PUSH IT UP IMPATIENTLY UNTIL IT TIGHTENED HER SOFT FLESH
THEIR EYES MET
THEIR EYES MET
VERY WELL HIS EYE BRIGHTENED WITH EXULTATION
AND EVEN AS IT WAS SHE WAS SO TREMBLING AND AFFRIGHTED THAT SHE FELT SHE COULD NOT WALK HOME ALONG THE ROAD WHICH DID INDEED SEEM LONELY AND DARK AS SHE GAZED DOWN UPON IT FROM THE BLAZE OF THE STATION
JUST AS MARGARET WAS THINKING ALL THIS SITTING OVER THE DRAWING-ROOM FIRE--HER FATHER RESTLESS AND UNEASY UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THIS NEWLY-AROUSED FEAR OF WHICH HE HAD NOT AS YET SPOKEN--FREDERICK CAME IN HIS BRIGHTNESS DIMMED BUT THE EXTREME VIOLENCE OF HIS GRIEF PASSED AWAY
SO THAT SHE MIGHT GATHER THE SECURE FULFILMENT OF HER WISH FROM THE CALM STEADINESS OF HER DAUGHTER'S FACE
ALMOST BEFORE THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES INTO THE CAR SENT FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO FETCH THEM TO THE STATION THEY WERE GONE AWAY TO RETURN NO MORE
THE MORE ILL-LOOKING OF THE MEN--THE DISCREDITABLE MINORITY--HUNG ABOUT ON THE STEPS OF THE BEER-HOUSES AND GIN-SHOPS SMOKING AND COMMENTING PRETTY FREELY ON EVERY PASSER-BY
THE HOUSE WAS SHUT UP FOR THE EVENING
SHE AWOKE WITH A START UNREFRESHED AND CONSCIOUS OF SOME REALITY WORSE EVEN THAN HER FEVERISH DREAMS
MRS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
I NE'ER COULD RIGHTLY FIX I MY MIND WHICH WAS WHICH
MISS HALE I WOULD RATHER NOT HEAR MR LENNOX'S OPINION OF MY AFFAIRS
SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR NICHOLAS HIGGINS
BUT SHE WENT AND LAY DOWN AND HER BROTHER COVERED HER FEET WITH A SHAWL AND THEN SATE ON THE GROUND BY HER SIDE
IT IS NO BOAST OF MINE REPLIED MR THORNTON
HE WILL PERHAPS ADMIT ME AFTER TO-MORROW OR SO HE SPOKE AS IF THE ANSWER WERE A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO HIM
AND IT MADE HER SO FOND OF HIM AND SHE WAS SO PROUD WHEN HE WOULD TURN AWAY FROM EVERY ONE AND CLING TO HER THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SHE EVER THOUGHT OF LEAVING ME AGAIN
I SUPPOSE YOUR AUNT SHAW WILL TRUST YOU WITH ME
SHE EXPRESSED AN AFFECTIONATE HOPE THAT IF THE REGIMENT STOPPED ANOTHER YEAR AT CORFU MARGARET MIGHT COME OUT AND PAY HER A LONG VISIT
SUPPOSE WE FIND SOME MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT
BUT THAT COULD NOT BE FOR SHE BROUGHT GOOD NEWS--THAT HIGGINS HAD GOT WORK AT MR THORNTON'S MILL
THROWING HERSELF BACK IN HER CHAIR FROM TIME TO TIME TO GAZE AT VACANCY AND THINK OF NOTHING AT HER EASE
BUT EVER WHEN TRUE FRIENDSHIP BINDS SPIRIT IT IS THAT SPIRIT FINDS
BUT BESIDES THE OBJECTION OF HER BEING A BETTER SERVANT THAN THEY COULD NOW AFFORD TO KEEP THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT
SHE WAS STILL PERFECTLY QUIET--NO CHANGE OF COLOUR OR DARKER SHADOW OF GUILT ON HER PROUD FACE
AND THAT WOULD BE A FAIR WARNING
AND YOU CANNOT BE LEFT ALONE MY DEAR AT YOUR AGE
I'VE LOST TOO MUCH TIME HERE ALREADY THEN IT'S NOT ALL SETTLED SAID EDITH DESPONDINGLY
HOWEVER I AM WILLING TO DO MY PART NOW
MR BELL HAD STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM A LOAF OF BROWN BREAD AND A JUG OF MILK TOGETHER WITH A STILTON CHEESE AND A BOTTLE OF PORT FOR HIS OWN PRIVATE REFRESHMENT READY FOR MARGARET ON HER COMING DOWN STAIRS
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL MEET IN HARLEY STREET TO-MORROW MORNING CHAPTER XLV NOT ALL A DREAM WHERE ARE THE SOUNDS THAT SWAM ALONG THE BUOYANT AIR WHEN I WAS YOUNG
THE BUZZ OF VOICES LIKE THE MURMUR OF A HIVE OF BUSY HUMAN BEES MADE ITSELF HEARD AS SOON AS THEY EMERGED FROM THE FOREST ON THE MORE OPEN VILLAGE-GREEN ON WHICH THE SCHOOL WAS SITUATED
IT'S BAD ENOUGH MY DEAR I KNOW
ARE THE BEDS COMFORTABLE
AND THE NAME OF THE STAR IS CALLED WORMWOOD AND THE THIRD PART OF THE WATERS BECAME WORMWOOD
THERE SHE REMEMBERED AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY HOW SHE HAD PLEASED HERSELF WITH TRACING OUT HER MOTHER'S FEATURES IN HER AUNT SHAW'S FACE,--AND HOW LETTERS HAD COME MAKING HER DWELL ON THE THOUGHTS OF HOME WITH ALL THE LONGING OF LOVE
MISERABLY DISTURBED THAT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH
BY-AND-BY HE CAME
DIXON WAS NOT IN THE ROOM
YOU'LL BE PERSUADED TO STAY THERE
SHE MADE ALL THESE REFLECTIONS AS SHE WAS TALKING IN HER STATELY WAY TO MRS HALE AND UTTERING ALL THE STEREOTYPED COMMONPLACES THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN FIND TO SAY WITH THEIR SENSES BLINDFOLDED
IF THE WORLD WAS FULL OF PERPLEXING PROBLEMS SHE WOULD TRUST AND ONLY ASK TO SEE THE ONE STEP NEEDFUL FOR THE HOUR
I DID NOT CRY
SHE STOOD BY THE TABLE NOT OFFERING TO SIT DOWN
THE FORE PART OF HIS HEAD WAS BALD
BUT HE WAS NO GREAT ANALYSER OF HIS OWN MOTIVES AND WAS MISTAKEN AS I HAVE SAID
I CALL IT VERY UNFEELING SAID SHE BEGINNING TO TAKE RELIEF IN TEARS
BUT SHE LONGED TO SEE THE OLD PLACE ONCE MORE EVEN THOUGH SHE SHIVERED AWAY FROM THE PAIN WHICH SHE KNEW SHE SHOULD FEEL
AND MR HALE HAD GIVEN ESPECIAL ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE DISTURBED BY THE USUAL AWAKENING
BLESS ME MISS
THE CARPET WAS FAR FROM NEW
YOUR POOR FATHER MARGARET
AND WHEN A WOMAN COMES BEFORE YOU TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR OWN SAKES TO BE REASONABLE CREATURES YOUR COWARDLY WRATH FALLS UPON HER
WHO IS THERE TO MOURN FOR ADAM BELL AND HIS WHOLE HEART IS SET AND BENT UPON THIS ONE THING AND MARGARET HALE IS NOT THE GIRL TO SAY HIM NAY
GOD HAS MADE US SO THAT WE MUST BE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT
MR LENNOX HAS ONLY SPOKEN OF THE GREAT PROBABILITY WHICH HE BELIEVES THERE TO BE OF YOUR REDEEMING--YOUR MORE THAN REDEEMING WHAT YOU HAVE LOST--DON'T SPEAK TILL I HAVE ENDED--PRAY DON'T AND COLLECTING HERSELF ONCE MORE SHE WENT ON RAPIDLY TURNING OVER SOME LAW PAPERS AND STATEMENTS OF ACCOUNTS IN A TREMBLING HURRIED MANNER
BUT THIS MISS HALE COMES OUT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC COUNTIES WHERE IF ALL TALES BE TRUE RICH HUSBANDS ARE RECKONED PRIZES MR THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HE CAME A STEP FORWARD INTO THE ROOM
HE WAS A LITTLE STRUCK NOTWITHSTANDING BY THE FORM OF THE ANSWER WHICH SOUNDED LIKE A MECHANICAL REPETITION OF HER FIRST REPLY--NOT CHANGED AND MODIFIED IN SHAPE SO AS TO MEET HIS LAST QUESTION
THOUGH THY BARK BE TEMPEST-DRIVEN THOUGH EACH PLANK BE RENT AND RIVEN TRUTH WILL BEAR THEE ON FOR EVER ANON
I AM COME HOME TO DRESS DRESS
ONE CHAP I KNOWED OF OLD AS WERE MEASTER ALL O'ER
MRS THORNTON HEARD A STEP LIKE HER OWN IN ITS DECISIVE CHARACTER PASS THE DINING-ROOM DOOR
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INCONVENIENT TO HIM TO DO SO YET HE FELT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE YIELDED IF MARGARET BY WORD OR LOOK HAD SECONDED HER FATHER'S INVITATION
IT WOULD TAKE A GOOD DEAL TO STIR HIM FROM HIS COOL MANNER OF SPEAKING
I'M SURE SHE COULD NOT WALK SHE HAD A CAB
I MUST PARE IT AND QUARTER IT BEFORE I CAN ENJOY IT MARGARET MADE A PLATE FOR THE PEARS OUT OF A BEETROOT LEAF WHICH THREW UP THEIR BROWN GOLD COLOUR ADMIRABLY
HE IS GOING TO LEAVE HELSTONE IN A FORTNIGHT
DON'T WASTE ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME YO MADE A REMARK SIR ON MY IMPUDENCE
MARGARET'S ROOM HAD BEEN THE DAY NURSERY OF HER CHILDHOOD JUST WHEN IT MERGED INTO GIRLHOOD AND WHEN THE FEELINGS AND CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN FIRST AWAKENED INTO FULL ACTIVITY
SOME OF THE SAILORS WHO ACCOMPANIED FREDERICK WERE TAKEN AND THERE WAS A COURT-MARTIAL HELD ON THEM ON BOARD THE AMICIA
I WAS TAKEN FROM SCHOOL AND HAD TO BECOME A MAN AS WELL AS I COULD IN A FEW DAYS
AND WANTED AS MARGARET SAW TO BE AMUSED AND INTERESTED BY SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS TO TELL HIM
THE MORBID SCALES HAD FALLEN FROM HER EYES AND SHE SAW HER POSITION AND HER WORK MORE TRULY
THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME
I'M SURE I CAN'T SAY SIR
I'VE MAYBE GETTEN THEM INTO MISCHIEF ALREADY FOR THEY KEPT IT VERY CLOSE
I HAVE NEVER NAMED IT TO EITHER MY BROTHER OR YOUR COUSIN SAID MR LENNOX WITH A LITTLE PROFESSIONAL DRYNESS OF IMPLIED REPROACH
REMAIN TO BE DENOUNCED--DRAGGED IT MAY BE IN CHAINS WERNER
AFTER THE KIND DOCTOR HAD GONE AWAY SHE STOLE DOWN TO FREDERICK WHO DURING THE VISIT HAD BEEN ADJURED TO REMAIN QUIETLY CONCEALED IN THE BACK PARLOUR USUALLY DIXON'S BEDROOM BUT NOW GIVEN UP TO HIM
I DID SOME GOOD
HE WROTE TWO LINES ON A SLIP OF PAPER PUT IT IN AN ENVELOPE AND SEALED IT UP
I MUST DO SOMETHING
THE ONLY PERSON--THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SYMPATHISE WITH ME AND HELP ME--WHOSE PRESENCE COULD COMFORT MY MOTHER MORE THAN ANY OTHER EARTHLY THING--IS FALSELY ACCUSED--WOULD RUN THE RISK OF DEATH IF HE CAME TO SEE HIS DYING MOTHER
NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE
HE CAME BACK AT LAST SOMEWHAT COMFORTED
AND WHAT DOES THAT LITTLE PROSPEROUS WOMAN'S INTERESTING TIME SIGNIFY IN COMPARISON WITH THAT POOR CREATURE THERE,--THAT HELPLESS HOMELESS FRIENDLESS MARGARET--LYING AS STILL ON THAT SOFA AS IF IT WERE AN ALTAR-TOMB AND SHE THE STONE STATUE ON IT
IT GAVE A NEW DIRECTION TO HIS THOUGHTS
MR HENRY LENNOX'S VISIT--HIS OFFER--WAS LIKE A DREAM A THING BESIDE HER ACTUAL LIFE
I'VE BEEN THINKING EVER SIN I SAW YOU WHAT A MARCY IT WERE YO DID NA TAKE ME ON FOR THAT I NE'ER SAW A MAN WHOM I COULD LESS ABIDE
GO BACK TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
BUT THAT WAS HARDLY TO BE EXPECTED NOT VULGAR OR COMMON THOUGH PUT IN HER FATHER RATHER JEALOUS OF ANY DISPARAGEMENT OF THE SOLE FRIEND HE HAD IN MILTON
DEAR DARLING MARGARET
DR DONALDSON TOOK HIS ARM AND LED HIM INTO THE BEDROOM
THEN HE UNFOLDED HIS ARMS AND HELD HER ENCIRCLED IN ONE FOR AN INSTANT
LET ME ORDER YOU SOME DINNER IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ANY
SHE LONGED TO ASK AND YET WOULD NOT HAVE HEARD FOR ALL THE WORLD
THEIR ENERGY THEIR POWER THEIR INDOMITABLE COURAGE IN STRUGGLING AND FIGHTING
HOW MUCH FATHER DOESN'T KNOW BUT IN COURSE TH UNION DOES
THREE MONTHS YOU MUST NOT COME FOR LESS OF THIS DELICIOUS CLIMATE--ALL SUNSHINE AND GRAPES AS COMMON AS BLACKBERRIES WOULD QUITE CURE HER
THE PORTER AT THE RAIL-ROAD HAD SEEN A SCUFFLE
WHEN MR THORNTON ROSE UP TO GO AWAY AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH MR AND MRS HALE HE MADE AN ADVANCE TO MARGARET TO WISH HER GOOD-BYE IN A SIMILAR MANNER
I GET SMOTHERED ENOUGH IN MILTON AND I THINK THE SOUND YO SPEAK OF AMONG THE TREES GOING ON FOR EVER AND EVER WOULD SEND ME DAZED
HER AUNT ASKED HER TO STAND AS A SORT OF LAY FIGURE ON WHICH TO DISPLAY THEM AS EDITH WAS STILL ASLEEP
AND THEN SHE WAS GLAD SHE HAD MADE HERSELF GO AND INSPECT FOR OTHERWISE TERRIBLE THOUGHTS WOULD HAVE HAUNTED HER DREAMS
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE
IT WAS INDEED WALLIS ADDED THE OPINION OF THE MEDICAL MEN--THAT HE COULD NOT SURVIVE THE NIGHT
AND THE DELIGHT OF WEARING THIS VERY BECOMING DRESS EDITH DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO FROWN OR TO SMILE
KNIT THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY WHICH NO LOOSE INDISCRIMINATE TALKING ABOUT SACRED THINGS CAN EVER ACCOMPLISH
THEN MARGARET FORCED OUT AN ICY DO YOU YES
THE CHILL SHIVERY OCTOBER MORNING CAME
HE SAID DID YOU HEAR THAT CRAMPTON IS ON GRAVELLY SOIL AND BY FAR THE MOST HEALTHY SUBURB IN THE NEIGHBOUR HOOD OF MILTON WHEN THEY RETURNED TO HESTON THERE WAS THE DAY'S ACCOUNT TO BE GIVEN TO MRS HALE WHO WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS WHICH THEY ANSWERED IN THE INTERVALS OF TEA-DRINKING
THE BOOKING-OFFICE WAS NOT OPEN SO THEY COULD NOT EVEN TAKE THE TICKET
LET US GO UP-STAIRS AND DO SOMETHING RATHER THAN WASTE TIME THAT MAY BE SO PRECIOUS
YOU MUST PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT OUR SKIES ARE NOT ALWAYS AS DEEP A BLUE AS THEY ARE NOW
TELL US ALL ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE IS A ROMAN CATHOLIC
AND WHEN THEY CAME UP MARGARET WAS STANDING TRYING TO STEADY HER DIZZY SELF
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE HATED MARGARET BUT A WILD SHARP SENSATION OF LOVE CLEFT HIS DULL THUNDEROUS FEELING LIKE LIGHTNING EVEN AS HE SHAPED THE WORDS EXPRESSIVE OF HATRED
BUT FATHER GIV'D IT HIM LAST NIGHT
BUT MARY HAD FRIENDS AMONG THE NEIGHBOURS SHE SAID WHO WOULD COME IN AND SIT A BIT WITH HER IT WAS ALL RIGHT
SHOLTO WOULD TELEGRAPH OR DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE I AM GOING TO OXFORD
TAKE A CAB THERE
THE NEW LOVE WAS DISPLACING HER ALREADY FROM HER PLACE AS FIRST IN HIS HEART
IS THAT YOU SAID HE REMOVING HASTILY TO A CLOSER PROXIMITY
BUT HIS FACE LOOKED OLDER AND CARE-WORN
FOR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF MRS SHAW'S MAID CAME VISIONS OF FORMER GRANDEUR OF THE BERESFORD BLOOD OF THE STATION SO SHE WAS PLEASED TO TERM IT FROM WHICH HER YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN OUSTED AND TO WHICH SHE WAS NOW PLEASE GOD TO BE RESTORED
EACH COULD TELL IN THEIR EAGER STAMMERING WAY OF SOME TENDERNESS SHOWN SOME INDULGENCE GRANTED BY THE LOST FATHER
WITH HER HEAD THROWN BACK AT FIRST TO FORCE ME INTO SPEAKING THE TRUTH
GUESS YO HOW HE DIED HE WERE DROWNED SAID MRS BOUCHER FEEBLY BEGINNING TO CRY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THIS ROUGH PROBING OF HER SORROWS
CHAPTER XVI THE SHADOW OF DEATH TRUST IN THAT VEILED HAND WHICH LEADS NONE BY THE PATH THAT HE WOULD GO
THEY WILL FIND THE NATURAL PUNISHMENT OF THEIR CONDUCT IN THE DIFFICULTY THEY WILL MEET WI IN GETTING EMPLOYMENT
AND YET YO SEE NORTH AND SOUTH HAS BOTH MET AND MADE KIND O FRIENDS IN THIS BIG SMOKY PLACE MARGARET HAD SLACKENED HER PACE TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE MAN AND HIS DAUGHTER WHOSE STEPS WERE REGULATED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE LATTER
HE KEPT RECURRING TO IT THROUGH THE EVENING WITH AN UNWILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST UNFAVOURABLE IDEA WHICH MADE MARGARET INEXPRESSIBLY SAD
POOR FATHER
HUSH TINY
IT WAS SUCH A HURRY
MR THORNTON SAW A LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF ON THE TABLE
BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE
WITH HIS FIRST CALM WORDS A VIVID COLOUR FLASHED INTO HER CHEEKS WHICH NEVER LEFT THEM AGAIN DURING THE EVENING
IT SUITS US WELL ENOUGH
A DRIVE OR CALLERS
WHERE IS IT HE SAYS--STOP--'MY FATHER MAY RELY UPON ME THAT I WILL BEAR WITH ALL PROPER PATIENCE EVERYTHING THAT ONE OFFICER AND GENTLEMAN CAN TAKE FROM ANOTHER
SHE WAS ROUSED BY DIXON'S ENTRANCE INTO THE ROOM
NO SAID SHE THAT BUBBLE WAS VERY PRETTY AND VERY DEAR TO OUR HEARTS
SO THEY HAD TO KEEP A CHARWOMAN IN ALMOST CONSTANT EMPLOY
MARGARET FELT INTUITIVELY THAT IN AN INSTANT ALL WOULD BE UPROAR
AND ALWAYS BE FOR CHANGE PREPARED FOR THE WORLD'S LAW IS EBB AND FLOW FROM THE ARABIC
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RELIEF TO HIM IF HE COULD HAVE SAT DOWN AND CRIED ON A DOOR-STEP BY A LITTLE CHILD WHO WAS RAGING AND STORMING THROUGH HIS PASSIONATE TEARS AT SOME INJURY HE HAD RECEIVED
THE ENGINE-ROOM IS AT THE STREET-END OF THE FACTORY
I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN
SHE TOOK HIS HAND IN HERS AND GRASPED IT TIGHT BUT SHE COULD NOT LIFT UP HER HEAD
HOWEVER THE NOTE WAS TAKEN FROM HER BEFORE SHE HAD EVEN HAD TIME TO LOOK IT OVER AND TREASURED UP IN A POCKET-BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A LONG LOCK OF BLACK HAIR THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED FREDERICK'S EYES TO GLOW WITH PLEASURE
I TOLD MY SON YESTERDAY THAT I THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE SHORT AS WAS THE INTERVAL YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OR LEARNT SOMETHING OF THIS OTHER LOVER WHAT MUST YOU THINK OF ME MADAM ASKED MARGARET THROWING HER HEAD BACK WITH PROUD DISDAIN TILL HER THROAT CURVED OUTWARDS LIKE A SWAN'S
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO GIVE HIM A NOTE TO MR LENNOX
SHE STOOD AWAITING THE OPENING OF HIS BUSINESS THERE
HOO'S COMING ROUND
SHE MADE HIM LOOK AT HER
IT WAS VERY WELL FOR MARGARET THAT THE EXTREME QUIET OF THE HARLEY STREET HOUSE DURING EDITH'S RECOVERY FROM HER CONFINEMENT GAVE HER THE NATURAL REST WHICH SHE NEEDED
THE VERY DARINGNESS WITH WHICH MOTHER AND SON SPOKE OUT UNPALATABLE TRUTHS THE ONE TO THE OTHER SHOWED A RELIANCE ON THE FIRM CENTRE OF EACH OTHER'S SOULS WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MRS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS--THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING-PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION
BUT THEY BOTH KEPT SILENCE
BUT THOUGH THE BROTHER AND SISTER HAD AN INSTANT OF SYMPATHY IN THEIR RECIPROCAL GLANCES THEY DID NOT EXCHANGE A WORD
THE SARCASTIC FEELING WAS CALLED OUT BY MRS SHAW'S CONVERSATION WITH HIS BROTHER
BUT SHE FELT AS IF IT WOULD BE A GREATER RELIEF TO HER TO REMAIN QUIETLY AT HOME ENTIRELY FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER AND SO TO REST HER MIND AND HEART IN A MANNER WHICH SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS PAST
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DARED TO ALLOW HERSELF THIS RELIEF FOR DAYS
BUT FROM THE IMMENSE SPECULATIONS THAT HAD COME TO LIGHT IN MAKING A BAD END IN AMERICA AND YET NEARER HOME IT WAS KNOWN THAT SOME MILTON HOUSES OF BUSINESS MUST SUFFER SO SEVERELY THAT EVERY DAY MEN'S FACES ASKED IF THEIR TONGUES DID NOT WHAT NEWS
THEN MARGARET WENT ON
MARGARET HAD NOT BEEN GONE FIVE MINUTES WHEN MR THORNTON CAME IN HIS FACE ALL A-GLOW
DO NOT DAMAGE YOUR CAUSE BY THIS VIOLENCE
AT LEAST THOSE WHO APPLIED WERE WELL SCOLDED BY DIXON FOR THINKING THAT SUCH AS THEY COULD EVER BE TRUSTED TO WORK IN A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE
HE'D A THIN BOOK I HIS HAND AND SAYS HE HIGGINS I'M TOLD YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE DAMNED FOOLS THAT THINK YOU CAN GET HIGHER WAGES FOR ASKING FOR EM
I'LL NOT DENY BUT WHAT TH UNION FINDS IT NECESSARY TO FORCE A MAN INTO HIS OWN GOOD
SHE REMEMBERED THE DARK DIM LOOK OF THE LONDON NURSERY PRESIDED OVER BY AN AUSTERE AND CEREMONIOUS NURSE WHO WAS TERRIBLY PARTICULAR ABOUT CLEAN HANDS AND TORN FROCKS
IS IT SO DESPERATE A SPECULATION
NOW CERTAINLY THE TIME IS NOT COME FOR THE HANDS TO HAVE ANY INDEPENDENT ACTION DURING BUSINESS HOURS
WHEN THE NURSERY IS FINISHED I SHALL INSIST UPON A LITTLE ORDER
THEY MAY SAY WHAT THEY LIKE BUT I HAVE HIS OWN LETTERS TO SHOW AND I'LL BELIEVE HIM THOUGH HE IS MY SON SOONER THAN ANY COURT-MARTIAL ON EARTH
CHAPTER L CHANGES AT MILTON HERE WE GO UP UP UP
YOU ARE A KIND GIRL
FOR THE SWIFT RIGHT ARM OF THE LAW SHOULD BE IN READINESS TO STRIKE AS SOON AS THEY COULD PROVE A FAULT
IT WAS MR THORNTON
BUT SHE WOULD RATHER HAVE GONE OVER THESE DEAR-LOVED WALKS IN SILENCE IF INDEED SHE WERE NOT UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONE
WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPARE MAMMA SUCH ANOTHER NIGHT ASKED MARGARET ON THE THIRD DAY
GI ME WORK MEANS AND I'LL DO IT LIKE A MAN THEM'S GOOD WORDS AND BAD WORDS ARE REFUSING YOU WORK WHEN YOU ASK FOR IT AY
MARGARET MIGHT FEAR THE VIOLENCE OF THE IMPULSIVE NATURE THUS OCCASIONALLY BETRAYED BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO MAKE HER DISTRUST OR RECOIL IN THE LEAST FROM THE NEW-FOUND BROTHER
I THINK WHAT YOU CALL THE MAKESHIFT CONTRIVANCES AT DEAR HELSTONE WERE A CHARMING PART OF THE LIFE THERE I SHALL NEVER SEE HELSTONE AGAIN MARGARET SAID MRS HALE THE TEARS WELLING UP INTO HER EYES
MARGARET STEPPED FORWARD
AND HERE HAD SHE BEEN GUILTY OF IT
HE WAS USHERED INTO THE LITTLE DRAWING-ROOM AND KINDLY GREETED BY MR HALE WHO LED HIM UP TO HIS WIFE WHOSE PALE FACE AND SHAWL-DRAPED FIGURE MADE A SILENT EXCUSE FOR THE COLD LANGUOR OF HER GREETING
MORE PEOPLE CAME--MORE AND MORE
MARGARET COULD YOU NOT HAVE LOVED ME
ALLOW ME TO SAY MISS HALE THAT YOU WERE RATHER PREMATURE IN EXPRESSING YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT
SO HE TURNED TO SOME OF THE DRY MATTERS OF BUSINESS THAT LAY BETWEEN MR BELL AND HIM AS LANDLORD AND TENANT
I KNEW HE HAD GONE INTO A SHOP AND THAT HIS EARNINGS WITH SOME FRAGMENT OF PROPERTY SECURED TO HIS MOTHER HAD BEEN MADE TO KEEP THEM FOR A LONG TIME
I'D SPEAK UP AGAIN TH HARD WAY THEY'RE DRIVING ON US GOOD-BYE SAID MARGARET HASTILY
BUT SHE IS MUCH STRONGER
BUT HE CAUGHT IT NEVERTHELESS
A STRUGGLING BARRISTER TO THINK OF MATRIMONY MARGARET COULD NOT ANSWER THIS
ABOUT WOMEN NOT MEDDLING
BUT THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO INDULGE HIMSELF IN GRUMBLING WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO SEND A BULLETIN EVERY TIME
GOOD CHEER
THAT I CANNOT BE,'--('TO HER SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ADDING BUT SHE RELENTED AT THE SIGHT OF THAT POOR ANXIOUS FACE.)--'IT IS NOT MY NATURE TO SHOW AFFECTION EVEN WHERE I FEEL IT NOR DO I VOLUNTEER ADVICE IN GENERAL
FULL OF DETAILS ABOUT HERSELF HER HUSBAND AND CHILD
THAT IS THE EXACT TONE IN YOU THAT SHE STOPPED SHORT
HER MOTHER ONLY REPLIED COLDLY THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE TOLD HER AND THAT THEN AT ANY RATE HE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVISER TO GIVE HIM COUNSEL
MY CHILD WILL BE WITHOUT A MOTHER;--IN A STRANGE PLACE,--IF I DIE--WILL YOU AND HER FILMY WANDERING EYES FIXED THEMSELVES WITH AN INTENSITY OF WISTFULNESS ON MRS THORNTON'S FACE
YO SEE BOUCHER'S BEEN PULLED DOWN WI HIS CHILDER,--AND HER BEING SO CRANKY AND A THEY COULD PAWN HAS GONE THIS LAST TWELVEMONTH
INTERESTING TIME BE MR BELL RESTRICTED HIMSELF TO COUGHING OVER THE END OF HIS SENTENCE
AND I WOULDN'T MIND A BIT GOING MYSELF IF THAT WOULD SATISFY HER
FROM THIS WAKING DREAM SHE WAS ROUSED
AND IT IS ARRANGED THAT WE GO TO LIVE IN MILTON-NORTHERN MRS HALE LOOKED UP IN MARGARET'S FACE ALL THE TIME SHE WAS SPEAKING THESE WORDS
MARGARET IS MY STAFF--MY RIGHT HAND DR DONALDSON GAVE HIS CLEAR SENSIBLE DIRECTIONS
BY-AND-BY MARGARET SAID
SHE SHOWED IT BY BRUSHING AWAY VICIOUSLY AT MARGARET'S HAIR UNDER PRETENCE OF BEING IN A GREAT HURRY TO GO TO MRS HALE
SHE'S A PAPIST MISS ISN'T SHE I BELIEVE--OH YES CERTAINLY SAID MARGARET A LITTLE DAMPED FOR AN INSTANT AT THIS RECOLLECTION
THEER'S NE'ER A MAN TO CALL A MAN AMONGST US BUT WHAT WOULD DO TH SAME
WE HELP TO MAKE THEIR PROFITS AND WE OUGHT TO HELP SPEND EM
MANY A YOUNG WOMAN HAS LOST HER CHARACTER BEFORE NOW MARGARET'S EYES FLASHED FIRE
BUT I CHARGE YOU MARGARET AS YOU YOURSELF HOPE FOR COMFORT IN YOUR LAST ILLNESS BRING HIM TO ME THAT I MAY BLESS HIM
THERE IS SOME TALK OF IT AS I UNDERSTAND WITH A CONNECTION OF THE FAMILY THEN SHE'LL NOT BE FOR COMING TO MILTON AGAIN I RECKON NO STOP A MINUTE MEASTER THEN GOING UP CONFIDENTIALLY CLOSE HE SAID IS TH YOUNG GENTLEMAN CLEARED HE ENFORCED THE DEPTH OF HIS INTELLIGENCE BY A WINK OF THE EYE WHICH ONLY MADE THINGS MORE MYSTERIOUS TO MR THORNTON
BUT SHE HAS THE HONESTY TO CHANGE HER WORD WHEN SHE COMES TO ME--MRS LENNOX IS TO KNOW ME
BUT SHE'LL RALLY THIS TIME THIS TIME
PERHAPS AFTER ALL MORE A LOSS OF THE FRAGRANCE OF GRASS AND HERBAGE THAN ANY POSITIVE TASTE OR SMELL
BUT THE HAIR GREW THIN AND LONG BEHIND AND EVERY SEPARATE LOCK WAS A CONDUIT FOR WATER
NOT YET TWENTY
I WAS JUST AT THE LAST GASP WHEN YOU CAME IN
I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF-REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
SOME OF THE LADIES STARTED BACK AS IF HALF-ASHAMED OF THEIR FEMININE INTEREST IN DRESS
HE'S AS SLIPPERY AS AN EEL HE IS
THERE WAS SUCH A SIMPLE RELIANCE ON HER WOMANLY SYMPATHY WITH THEIR LOVE OF DRESS AND ON HER KINDLINESS THAT SHE GLADLY REPLIED TO THESE INQUIRIES AS SOON AS SHE UNDERSTOOD THEM
THE HEAVY WALK WAS IN STRANGE CONTRAST WITH THE RESOLUTE CLEAR DETERMINATION OF THE MAN TO SPEAK TO HIM
HITHERTO THERE HAD BEEN NO FAILURES IN MILTON
SHE COULD NOT LET HIM SLIP OUT OF HER HANDS JUST THEN
BUT SOMEHOW WE MUST LIVE
SHE LOOKS QUITE PALE AND WHITE WHEN SHE IS ILL
BUT I NE'ER HEERD O ONY OF THEM CALLING ME O'ER-MODEST SAID HIGGINS
THERE AREN'T TEN COOKS IN ENGLAND TO BE TRUSTED AT IMPROMPTU DINNERS
NOT ALONE SAID MR HALE SOLEMNLY
AND A HUNDRED A YEAR WOULD GO A VERY LITTLE WAY AFTER THE NECESSARY WANTS OF HOUSEKEEPING ARE MET TOWARDS PROVIDING YOUR MOTHER WITH ALL THE COMFORTS SHE HAS BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO AND OUGHT TO HAVE
HE KEPT IT VERY SACRED AND SAFE AND WAS JEALOUS OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TRIED TO GAIN ADMISSION
SHE COULD HARDLY TELL WHAT TO SAY AT FIRST AND WAS THANKFUL FOR ALL THE TEA-TABLE OCCUPATIONS WHICH GAVE HER AN EXCUSE FOR KEEPING SILENCE AND HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECOVERING HIMSELF
AND GO TO THE OUTWOOD STATION
HE LONGED TO REPLY WITH A JEST
AND HOW IS MRS THORNTON
PAPA I DO THINK MR THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN
NOT TO GO ON TALKING IN THIS HEARTLESS WAY I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT MRS HALE--THAT LADY IN CRAMPTON YOU KNOW--HASN'T MANY WEEKS TO LIVE
YET HE GRUDGED EVERY PENNY MADE BY OTHERS MORE DARING AND FAR-SIGHTED
I CAN ALWAYS DECIDE BETTER BY MYSELF AND NOT INFLUENCED BY THOSE WHOM I LOVE SAID HE AS A HALF APOLOGY FOR HAVING ARRANGED SO MUCH BEFORE HE HAD TOLD ANY ONE OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS INTENTIONS
NOW YOU'LL WAKEN YOUR MAMMA JUST AFTER SHE'S GONE TO SLEEP SO QUIETLY
MARGARET EXPLAINED HOW IT WAS THAT HER MOTHER COULD NOT ACCOMPANY THEM TO RETURN MRS THORNTON'S CALL
HE PANTED AS HE LISTENED FOR WHAT SHOULD COME
THEN YOU THINK YOU SHALL WEAR YOUR WHITE SILK
HIGGINS THOU KNOWED HIM
THEN HE LOOKED HER IN THE FACE AND SAID IN A SLOW HOARSE MEASURED WAY--'I DO MEAN IT MARGARET
OH HELSTONE
I SUPPOSE THE LENNOXES WILL ASK HER TO LIVE WITH THEM
THERE HE HAD NEVER RECOVERED SUFFICIENT CONSCIOUSNESS TO GIVE ANY DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF HIS FALL ALTHOUGH ONCE OR TWICE HE HAD HAD GLIMMERINGS OF SENSE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE AUTHORITIES SEND FOR THE NEAREST MAGISTRATE IN HOPES THAT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE DYING MAN'S DEPOSITION OF THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH
AND IN A DAY OR TWO AT MOST HE WOULD BE SAFELY OUT OF ENGLAND
THERE IS A TRAIN IN HALF-AN-HOUR
IT WAS A MOST UNLUCKY DAY FOR MR DONALDSON TO SEE HER ON SO HE WENT AWAY TO HIS DAY'S DUTIES NOW INCREASED BY THE PREPARATION OF SOME LECTURES HE HAD PROMISED TO DELIVER TO THE WORKING PEOPLE AT A NEIGHBOURING LYCEUM
I WISH FATHER WOULD NOT SPEAK AS HE DOES
MRS HALE FELT THAT THIS PROMISE DID NOT INCLUDE ALL
AND THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE STRANGE HE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SPEAKING ABOUT DIET I ASKED HIM PAPA ANOTHER PAUSE
HOW MARTHA HAD GONE TO LIVE WITH MISS THORNTON ON THE LATTER'S MARRIAGE
IT IS UNDER THE HAIR IS IT NOT QUITE
HE MADE MANY INQUIRIES I CAN ASSURE YOU
HE WOULD
GO SAID SHE ONCE MORE AND NOW HER VOICE WAS LIKE A CRY THE SOLDIERS ARE SENT FOR--ARE COMING
I MUST CONFESS THAT ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT BECOME SO INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH ANY WORKMEN AS MARGARET HAS I AM VERY MUCH STRUCK BY THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYED ON THE VERY SURFACE OF THINGS
ALL THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH YOU IN IS TRADE,--SO THEY THINK,--AND ALL THAT IT CONCERNS THEM THEREFORE TO RECTIFY YOUR OPINIONS IN IS THE SCIENCE OF TRADE I'M GLAD SIR SAID HIGGINS WITH A CURIOUS WINK OF HIS EYE THAT YO PUT IN SO THEY THINK I'D HA THOUGHT YO A HYPOCRITE I'M AFEARD IF YO HADN'T FOR ALL YO'R A PARSON OR RAYTHER BECAUSE YO'R A PARSON
HE WERE FOUND DROWNED
PEOPLE CAN SPEAK OF UTOPIA MUCH MORE EASILY THAN OF THE NEXT DAY'S DUTY
AND WHAT IS EM TO DO
MR HALE HAD RETURNED FROM HIS MORNING'S ROUND AND WAS AWAITING HIS VISITOR JUST OUTSIDE THE WICKET GATE THAT LED INTO THE GARDEN
BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPRESSED EITHER SURPRISE OR PLEASURE OR DISLIKE TO THE IDEA
AND MORE CAME RUNNING UP JUST WHEN THE YARD WAS CLEARING
WAS ANXIOUS FOR THE VILLAGE POSTMAN WHOSE SUMMONS TO THE HOUSE-HOLD WAS A RAP ON THE BACK-KITCHEN WINDOW-SHUTTER--A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM
YOU SEE HERE THERE ARE NO VIEWS THAT CAN GIVE ONE AN EXCUSE FOR STOPPING TO TAKE BREATH
MARGARET RATHER ENCOURAGED THIS LIGHT MERRY WAY OF VIEWING HER FATHER'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH MR THORNTON BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT HER MOTHER WAS INCLINED TO LOOK UPON THIS NEW FRIENDSHIP OF HER HUSBAND'S WITH JEALOUS EYES
NOW IF WE WERE AT HELSTONE THERE WOULD BE TWENTY--A HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH
THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH WAS THAT WHEN SHE MET IT AT THE DOOR AND TRIED TO CARRY IT IN IT WAS TOO HEAVY FOR HER AND SHE CAME IN POUTING WITH A BLACK MARK ON HER MUSLIN GOWN AND A LITTLE ROUND WHITE HAND INDENTED BY THE HANDLE WHICH SHE TOOK TO SHOW TO CAPTAIN LENNOX JUST LIKE A HURT CHILD AND OF COURSE THE REMEDY WAS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES
AND NOW THEY COME TO US AND SAY WE'RE TO TAKE LESS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE
JUST THEM THREE
I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER I DARE WISH HIM TO COME OR NOT
SO DR DONALDSON ASSURED MARGARET
I HAVE PASSED OUT OF CHILDHOOD INTO OLD AGE
LATER ON IN THE YEAR THIS LINE OF RAILWAY SHOULD BE STIRRING AND ALIVE WITH RICH PLEASURE-SEEKERS
WELL MOTHER ASKED MR THORNTON THAT NIGHT WHO HAVE ACCEPTED YOUR INVITATIONS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST FANNY WHERE ARE THE NOTES
OH HOW UNHAPPY THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN
I WAS REALLY AFRAID FOR MASTER THAT HE'D HAVE A STROKE WITH GRIEF
HE WAS SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE SHIP--THE ORION--IN WHICH FREDERICK SAILED THE VERY FIRST TIME
HE HAD NOT SAT DOWN AND NOW HE SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE TABLE ALMOST AS IF HE HAD DISCOVERED AN UNOPENED LETTER WHICH HAD MADE HIM FORGET THE PRESENT COMPANY
MARGARET WAS STRUCK AFRESH BY HER COUSIN'S BEAUTY
SO I COOLLY TOOK THE PART ASSIGNED TO ME WHICH IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF STEWARD TO A CLUB
BUT WHY DEAR PAPA
ON WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR MOTHER
THEY SET UP SUCH A CRY OF DESPAIR AS THEY GUESSED THE TRUTH THAT MARGARET KNEW NOT HOW TO BEAR IT
DIXON HAD LEARNT PART OF THE TRUTH--BUT ONLY PART
SHALL WE GO PAST THE VICARAGE ASKED MR BELL
EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN I WAS A GIRL LIVING WITH YOUR AUNT SHAW AT BERESFORD COURT SIR JOHN USED TO GIVE FOR THE FIRST TOAST--"CHURCH AND KING AND DOWN WITH THE RUMP MARGARET WAS GLAD THAT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS WERE TURNED AWAY FROM THE FACT OF HER HUSBAND'S SILENCE TO HER ON THE POINT WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SO NEAR HIS HEART
DON'T LOSE A SINGLE POST
AND MEN THEER MUN HAVE THEIR FAMILIES TO KEEP--MAPPEN SIX OR SEVEN CHILDER
THERE'S A DEAL TO BEAR THERE SAID MARGARET
SHE CONSENTED TO REMAIN IN BED THAT DAY SAYING SHE CERTAINLY WAS TIRED
AND RETURNED
AT ANY RATE THERE IS AN OPENING AS I HAVE SAID FOR A PRIVATE TUTOR
MR THORNTON'S FACE ASSUMED A LIKENESS TO HIS MOTHER'S WORST EXPRESSION WHICH IMMEDIATELY REPELLED THE WATCHING MARGARET
MR HALE WAS UTTERLY LISTLESS AND INCAPABLE OF DECIDING ON ANYTHING
YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED YOUR FEELINGS MUCH SINCE THEN YES--YOU MUST GO REPEATED MR HALE ANSWERING MARGARET'S QUESTION WHICH SHE HAD ASKED SOME TIME AGO
SHE LET HER GO
THEN YOU SAID MANY GOOD WORDS--WHEN MY FATHER DIED AND WE WERE SOMETIMES SORELY SHORT OF COMFORTS--WHICH WE SHALL NEVER BE NOW
BUT EDITH PIQUED HERSELF ON HER DINNER-PARTIES
WE DID NOT PAY MARY--OR RATHER SHE REFUSED TO TAKE IT DIXON SAYS
THERE IS VERY HARD BODILY LABOUR TO BE GONE THROUGH WITH VERY LITTLE FOOD TO GIVE STRENGTH BUT IT'S OUT OF DOORS SAID BESSY
FOR THE PUPILS OF HER EYES DILATED INTO A BLACK HORROR AND THE WHITENESS OF HER COMPLEXION BECAME LIVID
OTHERWISE MISS MARGARET YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO PALE MARGARET'S BLACK HAIR WAS TOO THICK TO BE PLAITED
QUESTIONING WITHIN HERSELF IF NO ONE IN ALL THE CROWD MISSED HER NOT HIGGINS SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF HIM WHEN SUDDENLY MR BELL WAS ANNOUNCED
BESS LASS THOU'D BELIEVE ME THOU WOULDST--WOULDSTN'T THOU TURNING TO THE POOR DUMB FORM WITH WILD APPEAL
HE BORE ALL THIS PRETTY SILENTLY
I HAVE NO DOUBT IT IS THAT REALLY
FREDERICK SHE CRIED WHAT HAVE I NOT SACRIFICED FOR YOU EVEN WHEN SHE FELL ASLEEP HER THOUGHTS WERE COMPELLED TO TRAVEL THE SAME CIRCLE ONLY WITH EXAGGERATED AND MONSTROUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF PAIN
HAD SHE NOT THE POWER TO DAUNT HIM
BUT HAVING EASED HER CONSCIENCE BY SAYING THESE WORDS SHE WAS NOT SORRY THAT THEY WERE NOT HEARD
AND IF THEY DROVE AWAY THEIR MARKET THEY COULD NOT FOLLOW IT NOR TURN TO ANYTHING ELSE
MR BELL STOLE OUT OF THE ROOM AND WENT DOWN INTO THE STUDY WHERE HE ORDERED A FIRE AND TRIED TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS BY TAKING DOWN AND EXAMINING THE DIFFERENT BOOKS
THEY WERE MOSTLY OF THE AGE WHEN MANY BOYS WOULD BE STILL AT SCHOOL BUT ACCORDING TO THE PREVALENT AND APPARENTLY WELL-FOUNDED NOTIONS OF MILTON TO MAKE A LAD INTO A GOOD TRADESMAN HE MUST BE CAUGHT YOUNG AND ACCLIMATED TO THE LIFE OF THE MILL OR OFFICE OR WAREHOUSE
A GENTLEMAN SHE REPEATED IN ALLUSION TO THEIR FORMER CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT WORD THAT ANY WOMAN WORTHY OF THE NAME OF WOMAN WOULD COME FORWARD TO SHIELD WITH HER REVERENCED HELPLESSNESS A MAN IN DANGER FROM THE VIOLENCE OF NUMBERS AND THE GENTLEMAN THUS RESCUED IS FORBIDDEN THE RELIEF OF THANKS HE BROKE IN CONTEMPTUOUSLY
FOR THAT MAN'S SAKE--YO UNDERSTAND JERKING HIS THUMB BACK IN SOME UNKNOWN DIRECTION
HE FINDS A WOMAN TO LOVE AND SHE CARES NO MORE FOR HIS AFFECTION THAN IF HE HAD BEEN ANY COMMON MAN
HOWEVER THE LITTLE ANNOYANCE BY MAKING HIM COOLER AND MORE THOUGHTFUL GAVE A GREATER DIGNITY TO WHAT HE SAID
SHE REARRANGED HER MOTHER'S WORSTED-WORK AND FELL BACK INTO HER OWN THOUGHTS--AS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN BY MR THORNTON AS IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE ROOM SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE OCCUPIED IN EXPLAINING TO MR HALE THE MAGNIFICENT POWER YET DELICATE ADJUSTMENT OF THE MIGHT OF THE STEAM-HAMMER WHICH WAS RECALLING TO MR HALE SOME OF THE WONDERFUL STORIES OF SUBSERVIENT GENII IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS--ONE MOMENT STRETCHING FROM EARTH TO SKY AND FILLING ALL THE WIDTH OF THE HORIZON AT THE NEXT OBEDIENTLY COMPRESSED INTO A VASE SMALL ENOUGH TO BE BORNE IN THE HAND OF A CHILD
SHE IS AS WELL AS SHE EVER IS
DID NOT MANY A ONE I THE BIBLE
BELL HAS OFTEN SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT
I'LL NOT GIVE YOU WORK
I'LL NOT GIVE YOU WORK
MARGARET LOOKED WITH AN ANXIOUS EYE AT MR THORNTON WHILE HE WAS THUS OCCUPIED
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MATTED-UP CURRANT BUSHES MARGARET AT THE CORNER OF THE WEST-WALL IN THE GARDEN AT HOME DID SHE NOT
THEY WOULD WANDER TO HER
MISS HALE SAID DIXON IN A LOW VOICE WHERE'S THE USE O YOUR GOING TO SEE THE POOR THING LAID OUT
IT'S HALF-PAST SIX AND I MAY BE OUT FOR SOME TIME
THE DISCORD JARRED UPON HER INEXPRESSIBLY
AND SHE NEEDS WOMANLY COUNSEL I BELIEVE THOSE WERE HIS VERY WORDS
I AM NOT SPEAKING WITHOUT BOOK
AND SHE STROVE AT SUCH TIMES TO RECONCILE HER MOTHER TO HELSTONE
IT IS YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN AT HELSTONE--BUT I'LL ANSWER FOR IT IT IS STANDING THERE YET--EVERY STICK AND EVERY STONE AS IT HAS DONE FOR THE LAST CENTURY WHILE MILTON
ONLY A POLICE-INSPECTOR
MARTHA WENT TO THE DOOR AND LET HIM IN
I'VE NOT FELT SO BAD MYSELF FOR YEARS AS WHEN I WERE STANDING TALKING TO HIM THE OTHER DAY
WELL SHE HELD HER BREATH FOR THE ANSWER
SHE HELD HER WATCH TO HIS EAR WHILE SHE ASKED NICHOLAS IF HE HAD SEEN MR THORNTON
HER LAST ALARM WAS LEST THEY SHOULD BE TOO LATE AND MISS THE TRAIN
WHOSE LETTERS WERE THOSE GOD-DAUGHTER THAT YOU HID AWAY SO SPEEDILY ONLY DIXON'S REPLIED MARGARET GROWING VERY RED
ONE REMOVAL HAS COST ME MY WIFE
I AM MR HALE'S DAUGHTER
HE WAS POLITE ENOUGH
GOD CAN GIVE YOU MORE PERFECT REST THAN EVEN IDLENESS ON EARTH OR THE DEAD SLEEP OF THE GRAVE CAN DO BESSY MOVED UNEASILY
AND THERE WERE MANY OTHERS BESIDES
SHE IS BETTER NOW HE WHISPERED
AY HE REPLIED SHORTLY
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE MUCH WORSE
AT THE LAST MOMENT HENRY LENNOX'S REAL SELF BROKE THROUGH THE CRUST
I COULD FELL YO TO THE GROUND FOR TEMPTING ME
ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY AND LISTEN TO THE DRIP-DRIP OF THE RAIN UPON THE LEADS OF THE LITTLE BOW-WINDOW
BUT I'LL GO AND HELP DIXON
SHE KNEW HE WOULD NOT COME
HE'S NONE O US
SHE DID NOT LIKE THIS AUTHORITATIVE QUESTIONING
EACH MAN FOR HIMSELF
IT WOULD EAT YOU AWAY LIKE RUST
YOU FORGET TO WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING SHE STOOD UPRIGHT AND FIRM ON HER FEET NOW CONFRONTING THE WAITING-MAID AND FIXING HER WITH HER STEADY DISCERNING EYE
COME DOWN--THEY ARE GONE AND MISS HALE IS HURT HE BORE HER INTO THE DINING-ROOM AND LAID HER ON THE SOFA THERE
YOU AND SHE WILL BE UNBEARABLY STUPID IF YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ALL THIS TIME ABOUT SUCH WEARY THINGS VERY WELL
NONE WERE LIKE THEM NOW
IN FIVE MINUTES MORE I ONLY HOPE MY POOR IRISHMEN ARE NOT TERRIFIED OUT OF THEIR WITS BY SUCH A FIENDLIKE NOISE
BUT I SHOULD PINE AFTER MY KIND
EDITH SAYS SHE FINDS THE PRINTED CALICOES IN CORFU BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN IN LONDON DOES SHE SAID HER FATHER
AND IF I WAS FOLK OUGHT TO HA TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE WISE AFTER THEIR FASHION
WHY HE'D A CLEMMED TO DEATH IF TH UNION HAD NA HELPED HIM IN HIS PINCH
THE HARD REALITY WAS THAT HER FATHER HAD SO ADMITTED TEMPTING DOUBTS INTO HIS MIND AS TO BECOME A SCHISMATIC--AN OUTCAST
SHE WAS SO ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF ALL FORMS OF BUSINESS THAT IN NEARLY EVERYTHING SHE HAD TO REFER TO HIM
SHE HAD TAKEN MRS THORNTON'S REMONSTRANCE TO THE FULL AS KEENLY TO HEART AS THAT LADY EXPECTED
BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
CHAPTER LII PACK CLOUDS AWAY FOR JOY OR GRIEF FOR HOPE OR FEAR FOR ALL HEREAFTER AS FOR HERE IN PEACE OR STRIFE IN STORM OR SHINE ANON
AND AT THE END SAYING THAT AS THE CLIMATE DID NOT SUIT THE BABY AND AS MRS SHAW WAS TALKING OF RETURNING TO ENGLAND SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT CAPTAIN LENNOX MIGHT SELL OUT AND THAT THEY MIGHT ALL GO AND LIVE AGAIN IN THE OLD HARLEY STREET HOUSE
AND AS I SAID BEFORE THOUGH I SHOULD NA SAY IT I'M A GOOD HAND MEASTER AND A STEADY MAN--SPECIALLY WHEN I CAN KEEP FRO DRINK
OH AND THERE I DECLARE--NO IT IS NOT--YES IT IS--MARGARET WE HAVE JUST PASSED MR HENRY LENNOX
A GIRL'S LOVE IS LIKE A PUFF OF SMOKE,--IT CHANGES WITH EVERY WIND
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL SEE YOU HOME MISS HALE
WHAT A QUEEN SHE IS
IF HE COMES TO ENGLAND HE WILL BE HUNG
IT WAS PAST THE USUAL TEA-TIME WHEN SHE REACHED HOME
MR BELL SATE OVER THE FIRE CONSIDERING WHAT HE HAD BETTER DO
THE HOT AIR DANCED OVER THE GOLDEN STILLNESS OF THE LAND FARM AFTER FARM WAS LEFT BEHIND EACH REMINDING MARGARET OF GERMAN IDYLS--OF HERMAN AND DOROTHEA--OF EVANGELINE
AND THAT CAPTAIN REID WAS SENT ADRIFT IN A BOAT WITH SOME MEN--OFFICERS OR SOMETHING--WHOSE NAMES WERE ALL GIVEN FOR THEY WERE PICKED UP BY A WEST-INDIAN STEAMER
AND TH UNION SAYS THEY'LL NOT BE DOING THEIR DUTY IF THEY DON'T MAKE THE MASTERS GIVE EM THEIR SHARE
NO ONE DEPENDING ON HER FOR CHEERING CARE IF NOT FOR POSITIVE HAPPINESS
A MOTHER IS CURIOUS AND GREEDY OF COMMENDATION OF HER CHILDREN YOU KNOW MARGARET REPLIED IT WAS AS MUCH FROM WHAT MR THORNTON WITHHELD OF THAT WHICH WE HAD BEEN TOLD OF HIS PREVIOUS LIFE BY MR BELL,--IT WAS MORE THAT THAN WHAT HE SAID THAT MADE US ALL FEEL WHAT REASON YOU HAVE TO BE PROUD OF HIM MR BELL
I SAW IT ALL ALONG EVEN WHILE YOU TRIED TO PERSUADE ME THAT HE WAS ALL SORTS OF BAD THINGS
SHE COULD NOT SPEAK EVEN THE COMMON WORDS OF FAREWELL
I WOULDN'T KEEP THESE FELLOWS A DAY
SHE WAS VERY WEAK
I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS AND PEOPLE WITHOUT PRETENCE YOU MUST NOT BE SO FASTIDIOUS MARGARET DEAR SAID HER MOTHER SECRETLY THINKING OF A YOUNG AND HANDSOME MR GORMAN WHOM SHE HAD ONCE MET AT MR HUME'S
IF YOU PLEASE MISS MARGARET HE SAYS HE'S TO ASK PARTICULAR HOW YOU ARE
YOU COME TO OUST THE INNOCENT STRANGER
FETCH A PLATE MARGARET--A BASKET--ANYTHING MARGARET STOOD UP BY THE TABLE HALF AFRAID OF MOVING OR MAKING ANY NOISE TO AROUSE MR THORNTON INTO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER BEING IN THE ROOM
SHE DIRECTED MARGARET TO PACK UP A BASKET IN THE VERY DRAWING-ROOM TO BE SENT THERE AND THEN TO THE FAMILY
NOW I BELIEVE IF A GOOD CUSTOMER CHOSE TO COME AT MIDNIGHT I SHOULD GET UP AND STAND HAT IN HAND TO RECEIVE HIS ORDERS MARGARET'S LIP CURLED BUT SOMEHOW SHE WAS COMPELLED TO LISTEN
WELL AS I'M JUST AS MUCH CONVINCED OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING AS YOU CAN BE
I'M SO SLEEPY AT NIGHT THAT IF I ONLY LIE DOWN ANYWHERE I NAP OFF DIRECTLY
IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD ME WHEN I WAS MISS BERESFORD AND ONE OF THE BELLES OF THE COUNTY THAT A CHILD OF MINE WOULD HAVE TO STAND HALF A DAY IN A LITTLE POKY KITCHEN WORKING AWAY LIKE ANY SERVANT THAT WE MIGHT PREPARE PROPERLY FOR THE RECEPTION OF A TRADESMAN AND THAT THIS TRADESMAN SHOULD BE THE ONLY'--'OH MAMMA SAID MARGARET LIFTING HERSELF UP DON'T PUNISH ME SO FOR A CARELESS SPEECH
SHE HAD TOO MUCH THE HABITS OF SOCIETY FOR THAT
BUT MARGARET DON'T GET TO USE THESE HORRID MILTON WORDS
MY DEAR MARGARET:--I DID MEAN TO HAVE RETURNED TO MILTON ON THURSDAY BUT UNLUCKILY IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN WE PLYMOUTH FELLOWS ARE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM ANY KIND OF DUTY AND I MUST NOT BE ABSENT FROM MY POST
THROUGHOUT THE DAY MARGARET NEVER LEFT HER MOTHER
BUT IT'S CLEMMING TO US
BE EASY MOTHER NO
DON'T STOP ME EDITH BUT I MUST
BUT AS MARGARET ROSE TO GO HE STRUGGLED TO SAY SOMETHING
TO MILTON-NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
BUT THEN HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A PAIR OF TROUSERS TO FIT FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN THE TRADE SO IT WAS NO WONDER
HE DID NOT EVEN SEEM TO BE AWARE WHEN THEY GOT UP TO TAKE LEAVE
OH NOW I REMEMBER ALL
EDITH CAME DOWN UPON HER FEET A LITTLE BIT SADDER
WHAT HAD POSSESSED THE WORLD HER WORLD TO FIDGET SO ABOUT HER DRESS SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
HE CAME TO HER WITH PAPERS TO BE SIGNED
AND THAT TURNED HER PROUD DISLIKE INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND KINDER IF NEARLY AS PAINFUL--SELF-REPROACH FOR HAVING CAUSED SUCH MORTIFICATION TO ANY ONE
BOTH MUST FIND IT HARD TO REALISE A FUTURE OF ANY KIND
MEANWHILE AT MILTON THE CHIMNEYS SMOKED THE CEASELESS ROAR AND MIGHTY BEAT AND DIZZYING WHIRL OF MACHINERY STRUGGLED AND STROVE PERPETUALLY
POOR BESSY
THAT IS THE FACE OF THE THING
HE CHAFED IN SILENCE HOWEVER NOT DEIGNING TO REPLY TO HER QUESTION
SO AS I HAPPENED TO BE PASSING NEAR HIS HOUSE ONE DAY I JUST WENT THERE ABOUT SOME TRIFLING PAYMENT TO BE MADE
AND THE OLD MAN HAS NOT A KNOWN RELATION ON EARTH
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM IN GOOD HOPES
I WONDER WHEN YOU MILTON MEN INTEND TO LIVE
THEY ARE CLAIMING HE TOLD EM HE'D THINK ABOUT IT AND GIVE THEM HIS ANSWER ON THE PAY DAY
CAN YOU GIVE ALL THESE PEOPLE A HINT THAT THEY HAD BETTER LEAVE IN QUIETNESS
SHE NEVER WOULD WISH IT UNLESS SHE FELT HERSELF REALLY STRONGER--REALLY BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT SHE WAS EH MARGARET SAID MR HALE ANXIOUSLY AS SHE PREPARED TO WRITE THE NOTE OF ACCEPTANCE THE NEXT DAY
THAT I MUST TAKE AS A JUST PENANCE
HERE WAS A LITTLE PIECE OF MISERABLE GNAWING CONFIRMATION
I CANNOT TELL WHAT BAD WORDS THEY DID NOT USE
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY MEANING WAS DOUBTED
I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU SO MR THORNTON WENT INTO THE STUDY AND DIXON HAD TO RETREAT INTO THE KITCHEN AND REINSTATE HERSELF IN HER OWN ESTEEM BY A PRODIGIOUS STORY OF SIR JOHN BERESFORD'S COACH AND SIX WHEN HE WAS HIGH SHERIFF
BUT YOU RUN GREAT RISKS ALLOW ME TO SAY IN BEING SO INDISCREET
SO UNJUSTLY TREATED BY HIS OWN
I CAN ILL SPARE IT
IT'S BUT BEARING ON ONE MORE WEEK AND YO JUST SEE TH WAY TH MASTERS LL COME ROUND PRAYING ON US TO COME BACK TO OUR MILLS
HER LIPS SWELLED OUT INTO A RICHER CURVE THAN ORDINARY OWING TO THE ENFORCED TENSION OF THE MUSCLES BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THEIR USUAL APPEARANCE SO AS TO RECOGNISE THE UNWONTED SULLEN DEFIANCE OF THE FIRM SWEEPING LINES
HE SOUGHT TO POSSESS THE INFLUENCE OF A NAME IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND FAR-AWAY SEAS,--TO BECOME THE HEAD OF A FIRM THAT SHOULD BE KNOWN FOR GENERATIONS
I SAID IT WAS A LIE AND SO IT WAS
SHE GLADLY TOOK ALL CHARGE OF THE SEMBLANCES OF DUTIES OFF EDITH'S HANDS
HE WAS DEAD
LIEUTENANT HALE AND EVEN THIS GIVING HIM THE TITLE OF THE SERVICE FROM WHICH HE HAD SO HARSHLY BEEN EXPELLED WAS SOOTHING TO MARGARET LIEUTENANT HALE IS HAPPY NOW
SHE DREW YOU ON TO AN OFFER BY A BOLD DISPLAY OF PRETENDED REGARD FOR YOU,--TO PLAY YOU OFF AGAINST THIS VERY YOUNG MAN I'VE NO DOUBT
MISS HALE I HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM
FORMERLY HE WAS AS SIMPLE AND NOBLE AS THE OPEN DAY
SHE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IT
DON'T THINK THAT I AM SUFFERING FROM WHAT YOU HAVE DONE DEAR PAPA
SHE WAS HANDSOMELY DRESSED IN STOUT BLACK SILK OF WHICH NOT A THREAD WAS WORN OR DISCOLOURED
BOTH SHE AND NICHOLAS TURNED ROUND AT THE SAME MOMENT AND THERE STOOD MR THORNTON WITH A LOOK OF DISPLEASED SURPRISE UPON HIS FACE
ARE YOU SURE OF IT MARGARET I AM SURE SHE SAYS SO PAPA THEN I AM SURE OF THE FACT SAID MR BELL
AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD
IF HE AND MR THORNTON WOULD SPEAK OUT TOGETHER AS MAN TO MAN--IF HIGGINS WOULD FORGET THAT MR THORNTON WAS A MASTER AND SPEAK TO HIM AS HE DOES TO US--AND IF MR THORNTON WOULD BE PATIENT ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO HIM WITH HIS HUMAN HEART NOT WITH HIS MASTER'S EARS YOU ARE GETTING TO DO MR THORNTON JUSTICE AT LAST MARGARET SAID HER FATHER PINCHING HER EAR
BUT I DARE SAY IT'S ABOUT NOTHING AT ALL DID HE NAME ASKED MARGARET ALMOST INAUDIBLY
THEY'VE JUST A NOTION THESE COMMON FOLKS OF ITS BEING A RESPECT TO THE DEPARTED
AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HER REJECTION BY EATING THEM ALL HIMSELF
GO PEACEABLY
HE HAD OVERHEARD WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
HE COULD ALMOST HAVE EXCLAIMED--'THERE IT GOES AGAIN THERE WAS SO LITTLE LEFT TO BE DONE AFTER HE ARRIVED AT THE PREPARATION FOR TEA THAT HE WAS ALMOST SORRY THE OBLIGATION OF EATING AND DRINKING CAME SO SOON TO PREVENT HIS WATCHING MARGARET
THE NEARER CRIES OF THE DONKEY-BOYS
I HEAR OF HER THROUGH HER AGENT HERE EVERY NOW AND THEN
THANKS FOR KINDNESS
BUT WHEN HE DID SPEAK IT WAS IN A SOFTENED TONE ALTHOUGH THE WORDS WERE GRUFF ENOUGH
AND HOW AT THAT VERY DINNER THEY HAD FIRST MET CAPTAIN LENNOX
MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
MARTHA MUST BE SENT AWAY ON HER HOLIDAY
STILL HER QUICK EYE SOUGHT OVER HIS FACE AND FOUND THERE TRACES OF SOME UNUSUAL DISTURBANCE WHICH WAS ONLY PUT ASIDE NOT CLEARED AWAY
WELL I'VE TOLD YO AT LENGTH ABOUT THIS'N BUT I'M TIRED OUT
BARBOUR AT CADIZ I KNOW
DYING IS NOTHING TO IT
I ONLY KNOW I CANNOT HELP IT
BUT SAYS HE ONE IN COURT TELLED ME HIS VERY WORDS THEY ARE WELL KNOWN
HE COULD NOT TELL
HE KNEW NOTHING OF FREDERICK
MARGARET SAW GLIMPSES IN HIM OF A SLIGHT CONTEMPT FOR HIS BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW AND FOR THEIR MODE OF LIFE WHICH HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER AS FRIVOLOUS AND PURPOSELESS
WE ARE TEUTONIC UP HERE IN DARKSHIRE IN ANOTHER WAY
IT WILL SEEM FAR AWAY--BUT WHEN YO COME TO WORDS I LIKE--TO TH COMFORTING TEXTS--IT'LL SEEM CLOSE IN MY EAR AND GOING THROUGH ME AS IT WERE MARGARET BEGAN
AT ANY RATE THEY TALKED IN DESPERATE EARNEST,--NOT IN THE USED-UP STYLE THAT WEARIED HER SO IN THE OLD LONDON PARTIES
LET US START AT TWELVE
NEVER MIND SAID HE THINKING TO ENCOURAGE HER
I SUPPOSE WE MUST GO INTO LODGINGS AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A HOUSE
SUCH A STRANGE PALLID LOOK OF GLOOM WAS ON IT THAT FOR A MOMENT IT STRUCK HER THAT THIS LOOK WAS THE FORERUNNER OF DEATH
I HA NONE SO MANY TO CARE FOR ME
I'M NOT ONE WI TWO FACES--ONE FOR MY MEASTER AND T'OTHER FOR HIS BACK
HER ROUND WHITE FLEXILE THROAT RISING OUT OF THE FULL YET LITHE FIGURE
MISS HALE THAT'S FAR TOO HEAVY FOR YOU TO LIFT NOT AT ALL THANK YOU DIXON REPLIED MARGARET COLDLY
WHO HAD ORIGINATED DISCORD IN THE CAMP AND SPREAD THE PANIC OF THE LAW BEING ARRAYED AGAINST THEM
HE HAD TO SECURE THEM FROM ALL CHANCE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE DISCONTENTED WORK-PEOPLE OF MILTON
TO BE SURE NOT THEY DUNNOT SAY YO MAY HAVE A BROTHER OR A FRIEND AS DEAR AS A BROTHER WHO WANTS THIS HERE BRASS FOR A PURPOSE BOTH YO AND HE THINK RIGHT
IF YO COULD HEAR THEM SPEAK YO'D NOT BE SHOCKED AT HIM
STEP BY STEP SHE GOT THE WOMAN TO ADMIT CERTAIN FACTS OF WHICH THE LOGICAL CONNEXION AND SEQUENCE WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR TO MARGARET
WE RETAIN MUCH OF THEIR LANGUAGE
WHO'S THAT,--MARGARET
NOW I DUNNOT KNOW HOW FAR OFF IT IS BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING IF I COULD GET EM DOWN THEER WHERE FOOD IS CHEAP AND WAGES GOOD AND ALL THE FOLK RICH AND POOR MASTER AND MAN FRIENDLY LIKE
SHE SNORTED SCORNFULLY OVER THE PICTURE OF THE BEAUTY OF HER VICTIM
THEN SHE HADN'T SO MUCH AS A DARNED STOCKING OR A CLEANED PAIR OF GLOVES IN ALL HER WARDROBE
AND HE SAID MRS HALE WAS GONE POOR LADY
MR THORNTON DECLINED HAVING ANY SHARE IN A PARTNERSHIP WHICH WOULD FRUSTRATE WHAT FEW PLANS HE HAD THAT SURVIVED THE WRECK OF HIS FORTUNES
NEVER YO FRET I'M ONLY WHERE I WAS
THEY CLAIMED TO BE SENT BACK
MR THORNTON WAS PERHAPS THE OLDEST OF MR HALE'S PUPILS
SHE COULD NO LONGER ABSTRACT HERSELF IN HER OWN THOUGHTS
AND YO'RE GOING TO BE A GRAND LADY UP I LUNNON AREN'T YO NOT A GRAND LADY SAID MARGARET HALF SMILING
HE SATE DOWN AGAIN AS IF HER LITTLE TOUCH HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF RESISTLESS STRENGTH
WHAT TIME IS YOUR TRAIN FRED TEN MINUTES PAST SIX
HE WAS RATHER LATE AND WALKED RAPIDLY OUT TO CRAMPTON
I WILL GO TO HER AND TELL HER
I MEANT TO HAVE KEPT IT FROM YOU TILL NIGHT MAY BE OR SUCH TIMES AS THAT WHAT IS THE MATTER
IF YOU DON'T I SHALL FEEL QUEER MYSELF ABOUT THE LACHRYMAL DUCTS AND I DON'T LIKE THAT I WON'T CRY A DROP SAID MARGARET WINKING HER EYES TO SHAKE THE TEARS OFF HER EYE-LASHES AND FORCING A SMILE
THAT WAS MY ANXIETY BUT HOW DO YOU STAND
I WON'T EXAMINE INTO MY OWN FEELINGS
NO ONE YET HAS EVER DARED TO BE IMPERTINENT TO ME AND NO ONE EVER SHALL
AND THEN TO MARK THE LOOSENING--THE FALL
SO SHE MIGHT STUDY HIM UNOBSERVED AND NOTE THE CHANGES WHICH EVEN THIS SHORT TIME HAD WROUGHT IN HIM
NOT ONE QUARTER AS COMFORTABLE
AND YET NO WONDER THAT HE AVOIDS ME BELIEVING WHAT HE MUST ABOUT ME SHE WENT OUT GOING RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO DROWN REFLECTION BY SWIFTNESS OF MOTION
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT AN AGREEABLE SENSIBLE FELLOW THIS TENANT OF YOURS IS
HOW LITTLE MONEY ARTICLES OF FURNITURE--LONG CHERISHED BY DIXON--HAD FETCHED AT THE SALE WHICH WAS A SHAME CONSIDERING HOW RICH FOLKS WERE AT MILTON
A TERRIBLE PAIN--A PANG OF VAIN JEALOUSY--SHOT THROUGH HER
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OF IT FOR YOU WELL WENCH
SHARP DECISIVE SPEECHES CAME THRONGING INTO HER MIND NOW THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO UTTER THEM
SHE COULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED ALL SHE WAS ENTERING UPON
RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND--MAN WOMAN OR CHILD--IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST
RATHER TOO SIMPLE FOR TRADE--SO IT'S PERHAPS AS WELL HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CLERGYMAN FIRST AND NOW A TEACHER
NAY I IF I WOULD CANNOT CLEANSE YOU FROM IT
MEANWHILE MARGARET HAD RETURNED INTO HER FATHER'S STUDY FOR A MOMENT TO RECOVER STRENGTH BEFORE GOING UPSTAIRS INTO HER MOTHER'S PRESENCE
WELL THEN PROVE YOUR GRATITUDE BY KEEPING THOSE FOUNTAINS OF YOURS DRY FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS
MARGARET ROSE UP
MARGARET ACCORDINGLY WENT UP AND DOWN TO BUTCHERS AND GROCERS SEEKING FOR A NONPAREIL OF A GIRL
DIXON HAS SHUT THE SHUTTERS
HE IS NOT A LADY'S MAN MARGARET WREATHED HER THROAT IN A SCORNFUL CURVE
YOU DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SOUTH
THEN SUDDENLY KISSING HER SHE WENT QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM
AND I SHALL THINK A DEAL O YOR KINDNESS
DEAR MARGARET YOU HAVE DONE WHAT IS RIGHT ABOUT IT
IF HOO TAKES IT I'LL TURN HER OUT O DOORS
BUT WHEN HE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THIS SUDDEN QUICK RESENTMENT HE RESOLVED TO CURB IT
OR IF THERE WAS IT WOULD BE A STRANGER AND THE OLD MAN WOULD WATCH IN VAIN FOR HER
HE STARED BACK ON HER WITH GLOOMY FIERCENESS
BUT LONG AFTER THE CREDITORS HAD GIVEN UP HOPE OF ANY PAYMENT OF OLD MR THORNTON'S DEBTS IF INDEED THEY EVER HAD HOPED AT ALL ABOUT IT AFTER HIS SUICIDE THIS YOUNG MAN RETURNED TO MILTON AND WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO EACH CREDITOR PAYING HIM THE FIRST INSTALMENT OF THE MONEY OWING TO HIM
AS I THINK NOW EVEN IF I COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT CRUELLEST MARTYRDOM OF SUFFERING THROUGH THE SUFFERINGS OF ONE WHOM I LOVED I WOULD HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME AS FAR AS THAT STEP OF OPENLY LEAVING THE CHURCH WENT
SHE THOUGHT I SUPPOSE THAT I WAS ONE OF THOSE POOR SICKLY WOMEN WHO LIKE TO LIE ON ROSE LEAVES AND BE FANNED ALL DAY
WOULD NOT HAVE MR HALE DISTURBED FOR THE WORLD WITH THE PROSPECT OF SO SOON MEETING HIM AT DINNER
COME COME
DON'T TALK SO MR HALE CAME TOWARDS THEM EAGER AND TREMBLING
THE HOPES OF WOMANHOOD HAVE CLOSED FOR ME--FOR I SHALL NEVER MARRY
A RAKE
HELSTONE IS LIKE A VILLAGE IN A POEM--IN ONE OF TENNYSON'S POEMS
BUT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF INTERFERING IN ANY OF THE SMALL DOMESTIC REGULATIONS THAT MRS THORNTON OBSERVED IN HABITUAL REMEMBRANCE OF HER OLD ECONOMIES
I'M SORRY THEY TOOK THE BABBY I'LL GO FOR IT SAID MARGARET
HERE HAVE I BEEN TALKING
I CONJECTURE A SIMULTANEOUS STRIKE
BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING DOUBTS PAPA
DO SPEAK PAPA
MARGARET RECOVERED HERSELF
NOT BETTER THAN LIKELY DID SHE LOOK
MY LASS SAID HE YO'RE BUT A YOUNG WENCH BUT DON'T YO THINK I CAN KEEP THREE PEOPLE--THAT'S BESSY AND MARY AND ME--ON SIXTEEN SHILLING A WEEK
I'LL READ IT TO HER WHILE YOU MAKE TEA THE NOTE PROVED TO BE A FORMAL INVITATION FROM MRS THORNTON TO MR MRS AND MISS HALE TO DINNER ON THE TWENTY-FIRST INSTANT
NOR GAINED MUCH GOOD FROM HAVING HIM IN HIGGINS'S BROW CLOUDED
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED AT HOME FOR YOU
ON ITS APPEARANCE IN HOUSEHOLD WORDS THIS TALE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFORM TO THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF A WEEKLY PUBLICATION AND LIKEWISE TO CONFINE ITSELF WITHIN CERTAIN ADVERTISED LIMITS IN ORDER THAT FAITH MIGHT BE KEPT WITH THE PUBLIC
NOW ILL-TEMPERED BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO COPE WITH A LIGHT HEART AGAINST ONE WHO WAS TRYING BY GAY AND CARELESS SPEECHES TO MAKE THE EVENING PASS PLEASANTLY AWAY,--THE KIND OLD FRIEND TO ALL PARTIES WHOSE MANNER BY THIS TIME MIGHT BE WELL KNOWN TO MR THORNTON WHO HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH HIM FOR MANY YEARS
SHE WOULD CARRY HIM OFF INTO A ROOM WHERE THEY TWO ALONE BATTLED IT OUT
IF HE HAD GIVEN HER THE OPTION BY REQUESTING OR URGING HER AS IF A REFUSAL WERE POSSIBLE SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE COME--TRUE AND SINCERE AS WAS HER SYMPATHY WITH MARGARET
A YOUNG PERSON CAN STAND IT
I AM NOW ONLY SPEAKING AS A FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S
IT'S RATE O WAGES I WAS TALKING OF
WHERE WAS I
DIXON HAD NOT MUCH TO TELL ABOUT THE HIGGINSES
BUT AS IN SOME WAY BRINGING HER IN CONTACT WITH LITTLE EAGER FACES ONCE WELL-KNOWN AND WHO HAD RECEIVED THE SOLEMN RITE OF BAPTISM FROM HER FATHER SHE SATE DOWN HALF LOSING HERSELF IN TRACING OUT THE CHANGING FEATURES OF THE GIRLS AND HOLDING SUSAN'S HAND FOR A MINUTE OR TWO UNOBSERVED BY ALL WHILE THE FIRST CLASS SOUGHT FOR THEIR BOOKS AND THE VICAR'S LADY WENT AS NEAR AS A LADY COULD TOWARDS HOLDING MR BELL BY THE BUTTON WHILE SHE EXPLAINED THE PHONETIC SYSTEM TO HIM AND GAVE HIM A CONVERSATION SHE HAD HAD WITH THE INSPECTOR ABOUT IT
YO'RE NOT TO THINK WE'D HA LETTEN EM CLEM FOR ALL WE'RE A BIT PRESSED OURSEL
MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT,--OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE HERBS AND FLOWERS IT CALLED FORTH
WHO IS HE
SHE STOOD FACE TO FACE AT LAST WITH HER SIN
BUT THAT IS JUST THE HEAT AND WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT YOU POSSIBLY
COME AND SEE HER THE VOICE IN WHICH SHE SPOKE WAS VERY LOW AND SOLEMN
I AM NOT SURE OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THEM
HE MIGHT BE RECOGNISED YOU KNOW IF HE WERE CALLED BY MY NAME MAMMA SAID MARGARET I WAS AT AUNT SHAW'S WHEN IT ALL HAPPENED
THEY KEPT HER OUT OF THE WAY OF OTHER FRIENDS WHO MIGHT HAVE ELIGIBLE SONS OR BROTHERS
WHERE IS MISS HALE ASKED EDITH AS SOON AS SHE HAD TRIED THE EFFECT OF THE GARNITURE
TOO TIRED TO TAX HER POWERS OF DESCRIPTION MUCH
THANK YO MISS
AND SINCE THEN NICHOLAS HAD GONE FOR THE DOCTOR
NURSED THEIR BABIES
HE DREAMT SHE CAME DANCING TOWARDS HIM WITH OUTSPREAD ARMS AND WITH A LIGHTNESS AND GAIETY WHICH MADE HIM LOATHE HER EVEN WHILE IT ALLURED HIM
YOU'D BE TAKING LESS WAGES THAN THE OTHER LABOURERS--ALL FOR THE SAKE OF ANOTHER MAN'S CHILDREN
WE MUST KEEP OUR DOORS SHUT,--WE MUST LET NO ONE IN
STILL SHE WAS GLAD TO HAVE SEEN THEM ALL AGAIN THOUGH A TINGE OF SADNESS MIXED ITSELF WITH HER PLEASURE
SHE HEARD HIM MURMUR TO HIMSELF THE MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS HAD EVEN MORE PAIN TO BEAR--I WILL NOT SHRINK THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MRS HALE INQUIRING FOR HER DAUGHTER
HE WAS ANXIOUS I THINK DOCTORS HAVE THAT ANXIOUS MANNER
YET IF WE WILL ONE GUIDE OBEY THE DREARIEST PATH THE DARKEST WAY SHALL ISSUE OUT IN HEAVENLY DAY
SAW THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND MARGARET IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
NEXT TO THE SERIOUS VITAL ANXIETY AS TO THE NATURE OF HER FATHER'S DOUBTS THIS WAS THE ONE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CASE THAT GAVE MARGARET THE MOST PAIN
AND BE SHE AS SCORNFUL AS SHE LIKED IT WAS A DUTY HE OWED TO HIMSELF TO EXPLAIN AS TRULY AS HE COULD WHAT HE DID MEAN
SHE SHOWED THEM LIKE A DOG FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH OF HER MOUTH
IT'S THE ONLY THING I ASK
MRS SHAW'S CORAL COULDN'T HAVE COME IN BETTER
BUT DON'T THINK OF WHAT I SAID THEN
AND TALKING LOUD TO ONE ANOTHER
DIXON TRUE TO HER POST OF BODY-GUARD ATTENDED MOST FAITHFULLY TO HER MISTRESS AND ONLY EMERGED FROM MRS HALE'S BED-ROOM TO SHAKE HER HEAD AND MURMUR TO HERSELF IN A MANNER WHICH MARGARET DID NOT CHOOSE TO HEAR
AND SHE SAYS SHE FEELS REFRESHED AND READY FOR TEA
FOR SHE WAS MOST ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT ALL LOOKED UPON IN THE LIGHT OF A MERE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH THE PRINCIPAL ADVANTAGE WOULD BE ON HER SIDE
BUT HER CALM FACE FIXED ON HIS PATIENT AND TRUSTFUL COMPELLED HIM TO ANSWER
IT WOULD KILL HIM
MRS THORNTON WATCHED FOR HER SON WHO WAS STILL IN THE MILL
BUT WITH THE MORNING CAME HOPE AND A BRIGHTER VIEW OF THINGS
MARLBOROUGH STREET ITSELF WAS THE FOCUS OF ALL THOSE HUMAN EYES THAT BETRAYED INTENSEST INTEREST OF VARIOUS KINDS
YOU SIGH OVER IT ALL
WHAT THE MAJOR PART THOUGHT T'OTHERS WERE TO THINK WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NO
ONE MOMENT HE GLOWED WITH IMPATIENCE AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT DO THIS THE NEXT HE FEARED A PASSIONATE REJECTION THE VERY IDEA OF WHICH WITHERED UP HIS FUTURE WITH SO DEADLY A BLIGHT THAT HE REFUSED TO THINK OF IT
IT IS MEN SUCH AS THIS THOUGHT HE WHO INTERRUPT COMMERCE AND INJURE THE VERY TOWN THEY LIVE IN
THEY GOT ON TOGETHER FAMOUSLY AT THE WEDDING BREAKFAST
I READ THE BOOK O REVELATIONS UNTIL I KNOW IT OFF BY HEART AND I NEVER DOUBT WHEN I'M WAKING AND IN MY SENSES OF ALL THE GLORY I'M TO COME TO DON'T LET US TALK OF WHAT FANCIES COME INTO YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU ARE FEVERISH
DIXON COULD NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR ENOUGH TRUE LOVE--FOR AS MUCH AS HERSELF
IT WAS A STINGING PLEASURE TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH HER AND FEEL HER PRESENCE
THE MILL LOOMED HIGH ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THE WINDOWS CASTING A SHADOW DOWN FROM ITS MANY STORIES WHICH DARKENED THE SUMMER EVENING BEFORE ITS TIME
I THOUGHT HE'D HA CARRIED HIS POINT AND HAD HIS REVENGE IN AN OPEN WAY
OH BESSY GOD IS JUST AND OUR LOTS ARE WELL PORTIONED OUT BY HIM ALTHOUGH NONE BUT HE KNOWS THE BITTERNESS OF OUR SOULS I ASK YOUR PARDON REPLIED BESSY HUMBLY
DURING THE TIME THAT MRS THORNTON WAS HAVING THIS INTERVIEW WITH MRS HALE MARGARET AND DIXON WERE LAYING THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND CONSULTING HOW THEY SHOULD KEEP FREDERICK'S COMING A PROFOUND SECRET TO ALL OUT OF THE HOUSE
BUT TO PLAGUE ME TO THE LAST HE TURNED BACK BEFORE HE GOT IN AND SAID IF YOU CAN HELP ME TO TRAP LIEUTENANT HALE MISS DIXON WE'LL GO PARTNERS IN THE REWARD
HER MEMORY HAD AN ARISTOCRATIC BIAS AND WAS VERY TREACHEROUS WHENEVER SHE TRIED TO RECALL ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECTED WITH THOSE BELOW HER IN LIFE
THE WOMEN GATHERED ROUND THE WINDOWS FASCINATED TO LOOK ON THE SCENE WHICH TERRIFIED THEM
SHE WAS TIRED NOW AND WOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED SILENT AND TAKEN THE REST HER FATHER HAD PLANNED FOR HER
POOR THING
POOR THING
LATTER DAYS BE FARRED
SHE TOOK HER HAND OUT OF MARGARET'S WITH A LITTLE IMPATIENT MOVEMENT AS IF SHE WOULD FAIN BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HER SON
SHE WAS SO TIRED SO STUNNED THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE NEVER SLEPT AT ALL
DIXON'S COMING MIGHT BE A COMPLIMENT BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME THING TO THE POOR SISTER WHO HAD HAD HER LITTLE PANGS OF JEALOUSY DURING BESSY'S LIFETIME AT THE INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND THE YOUNG LADY
MARGARET LOVE ONLY TASTE THESE GRAPES
BY YOUR LEAVE MISS SAID HE PUSHING MARGARET RUDELY ON ONE SIDE AND SEIZING FREDERICK BY THE COLLAR
MY CHEEKS WERE AS HOT AS FIRE AND MY VERY EYES BURNT IN MY HEAD
WELL SAID HE I DON'T KNOW WHAT MR LENNOX IS INCLINED TO DO BUT I'M DISPOSED TO BE MOVING OFF HOMEWARDS
HENRY SAID EDITH ONE DAY ARCHLY
AND YET SHE LONGED TO SEE HIM TO GET IT OVER
AND MR HALE THOUGHT OF MARGARET THAT APRIL EVENING JUST AS STRANGELY AND AS PERSISTENTLY AS SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM
CHAPTER LI MEETING AGAIN BEAR UP BRAVE HEART
THE CREAK OF WOOD SLOWLY YIELDING
BUT I WILL DO IT RATHER THAN GIVE IN IF THERE IS TO BE ALL THIS EXTRA EXPENSE I'M SORRY WE'RE GIVING A DINNER JUST NOW SO AM I,--NOT BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE BUT BECAUSE I SHALL HAVE MUCH TO THINK ABOUT AND MANY UNEXPECTED CALLS ON MY TIME
FOR MANY MONTHS THE EMBARRASSMENT CAUSED BY THE STRIKE HAD BEEN AN OBSTACLE IN MR THORNTON'S WAY
I'M SICK O MILTON ANYWAYS AND MILTON IS SICK O ME YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE SOUTH SAID MARGARET FOR ALL THAT
SHE MIGHT BE BETTER NOW
OLDER MEN MEN OF LONG STANDING IN THE TOWN MEN OF FAR GREATER WEALTH--REALISED AND TURNED INTO LAND WHILE HIS WAS ALL FLOATING CAPITAL ENGAGED IN HIS TRADE--LOOKED TO HIM FOR PROMPT READY WISDOM
AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS A YEAR WAS SOMETHING RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING THAT SHE DID NOT TAKE WINE
I'M COMING AGAIN TO-MORROW AND BRINGING MR THORNTON WITH ME TO HAVE SOME MORE TALK WITH MISS HALE MR THORNTON
HE GAVE HER THE NOTE WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD OF EXPLANATION
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN SOME OF THE FELLOWS IN CHARGE THEN IF I HAD HAD MY WITS ABOUT ME
BUT SUPPOSE IT WAS TRUTH DOUBLE STRONG IT WERE NO TRUTH TO ME IF I COULDNA TAKE IT IN
INDEED THE VERY RARITY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SEEMED TO MAKE MR HALE SET ONLY THE HIGHER VALUE ON IT
HER DRESS WAS VERY PLAIN
BUT HE HAS BEEN AS KIND AS CAN BE
THE NEXT MORNING MARGARET DRAGGED HERSELF UP THANKFUL THAT THE NIGHT WAS OVER,--UNREFRESHED YET RESTED
MRS THORNTON THE WOMEN-SERVANTS MARGARET,--ALL WERE THERE
TO TELL THE TRUTH MAMMA I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT MY BED AT ALL WHAT KIND IT IS
AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAD FORGOTTEN MY PROMISE YO OFFERED IT
BY IT LAY A DICTIONARY AND SOME WORDS COPIED OUT IN MARGARET'S HAND-WRITING
AND THE INSTITUTION ITSELF BEING IN DEBT WAS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET A GRATIS COURSE FROM AN EDUCATED AND ACCOMPLISHED MAN LIKE MR HALE LET THE SUBJECT BE WHAT IT MIGHT
SHE DARED NOT GO TO MEET HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT SHE HAD DONE ALL DAY FOR FEAR OF HER MOTHER'S JEALOUS ANNOYANCE
BUT NO ENDURING HOPE OF RECOVERY
DIXON SAYS IT IS A GIFT TO LIGHT A FIRE
SHE CONTENTED HERSELF BY LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR MERELY PLAYING WITH THE FOOD ON HER PLATE AND LOOKING GRAVE AND ABSENT
AT ONE TIME THE BEEF WAS TOO LARGE AT ANOTHER THE MUTTON WAS NOT FAT ENOUGH
LET ME IN
LET ME IN
IT NEEDS FETTLING AND WHO'S TO FETTLE IT IF IT'S AS YON FOLKS SAY AND THERE'S NOUGHT BUT WHAT WE SEE MR HALE WAS BUSY CUTTING BREAD AND BUTTER
IS IT NOT LIKE PAPA SAID SHE PEEPING OVER HIS SHOULDER AS HE LOOKED AT THE FIGURES IN MR LENNOX'S DRAWING
THESE VISIONS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DWELLING ON WITH COMPLACENCY IN HER CONVERSATION WITH MRS SHAW'S MAID SKILFULLY ELICITING MEANWHILE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATE AND CONSEQUENCE CONNECTED WITH THE HARLEY STREET ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE LISTENING MARTHA MADE DIXON RATHER INCLINED TO BE SUPERCILIOUS IN HER TREATMENT OF ANY INHABITANT OF MILTON
SOME ONE WAS PRACTISING UP A MORCEAU DE SALON PLAYING IT VERY RAPIDLY
SO I COAX IT DOWN AGAIN AS THE FISHERMAN COAXED THE GENIE
AND NOW DUNNOT TALK TO ME BUT JUST READ OUT TH CHAPTER
HE CAME UP TO HER
A CAST-AWAY LONELY AS ROBINSON CRUSOE--A PRISONER IMMURED IN A DUNGEON FOR LIFE--NAY EVEN A SAINT IN PATMOS HAS HIS ENDURANCE HIS STRENGTH HIS FAITH BEST DESCRIBED BY BEING SPOKEN OF AS A MAN I AM RATHER WEARY OF THIS WORD GENTLEMANLY WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE OFTEN INAPPROPRIATELY USED AND OFTEN TOO WITH SUCH EXAGGERATED DISTORTION OF MEANING WHILE THE FULL SIMPLICITY OF THE NOUN MAN AND THE ADJECTIVE MANLY ARE UNACKNOWLEDGED--THAT I AM INDUCED TO CLASS IT WITH THE CANT OF THE DAY MARGARET THOUGHT A MOMENT,--BUT BEFORE SHE COULD SPEAK HER SLOW CONVICTION HE WAS CALLED AWAY BY SOME OF THE EAGER MANUFACTURERS WHOSE SPEECHES SHE COULD NOT HEAR THOUGH SHE COULD GUESS AT THEIR IMPORT BY THE SHORT CLEAR ANSWERS MR THORNTON GAVE WHICH CAME STEADY AND FIRM AS THE BOOM OF A DISTANT MINUTE GUN
AND SO DID MR THORNTON AND BECAUSE THEY WALKED AWAY HE DID SO TOO
THE WHITE LIGHTNING-SCARRED TRUNK OF THE VENERABLE BEECH AMONG WHOSE ROOTS THEY HAD SATE DOWN WAS THERE NO MORE
THANK GOD SAID MR THORNTON AS HE WATCHED HER OUT
THE TAINTING BLOOD OF FALSEHOOD RUNS THROUGH US ALL
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THEY BOTH ARE OF COURSE SIR
I WILL FETCH A CAB IF YOUR SERVANTS ARE STILL AFRAID TO GO OUT OH THANK YOU SAID MARGARET
WHAT IS IT ASKED SHE
EDITH PICKED UP ALL SORTS OF MILITARY SLANG FROM CAPTAIN LENNOX AND AUNT SHAW NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF IT BUT YOURS IS FACTORY SLANG AND IF I LIVE IN A FACTORY TOWN I MUST SPEAK FACTORY LANGUAGE WHEN I WANT IT
BUT THAT VERY AFTER NOON ON NAMING HER ENGAGEMENT TO BESSY HIGGINS APROPOS OF THE SERVANT THAT MRS THORNTON HAD PROMISED TO INQUIRE ABOUT BESSY QUITE ROUSED UP AT THE INTELLIGENCE
MR LENNOX STOPPED READING
DOES HOO KNOW HOW HE DIED NO SAID MARGARET
DO NOT LET US HAVE TO THINK THAT THE WORLD HAS TOO MUCH HARDENED OUR HEARTS
AND DEFY HER AND THIS MISERABLE BODILY PAIN
I AM ABSOLUTELY CATCHING THE TRICK OF GOOD MANNERS HIS SELF-SATISFACTION LASTED HIM TILL HE WAS FAIRLY OUT IN THE STREETS WALKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH HENRY LENNOX
DIXON'S WORDS QUIETED HER FOR THE TIME
PROBABLY THERE WAS NOTHING MUCH TO BE HEARD THAT WAS NEW
TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
THEN HE BEGAN TO SHAKE ALL OVER AND TURNING AWAY FROM DR DONALDSON'S ANXIOUS CARE HE GROPED TO FIND THE DOOR
YOU ARE NOT FIT TO GO
AND I DARE SAY SHE'D GIVE HER EYES IF HE'D MARRY HER,--WHICH HE NEVER WILL I CAN TELL HER
LOST FOR EVERMORE AS FAR AS EARTH'S FOR EVERMORE WOULD EXTEND
AS SHE HURRIED TO MRS BOUCHER'S SHE HEARD THE CLANG AND IT SEEMED TO FILL UP THE MEASURE OF HER MORTIFICATION
THAT IS WHAT THEY ALWAYS STRIKE FOR
CAN I DO ANYTHING DOCTOR HE ASKED IN AN ALTERED VOICE
RECOVERED HIMSELF AND WENT WITH QUIET FIRMNESS TO THE DOOR WHICH SHE HAD LEFT OPEN AND SHUT IT
A YEAR AGO OR WHEN SHE FIRST WENT TO HELSTONE AND FIRST BECAME SILENTLY CONSCIOUS OF THE QUERULOUSNESS IN HER MOTHER'S TEMPER SHE WOULD HAVE GROANED BITTERLY OVER THE IDEA OF A LONG ILLNESS TO BE BORNE IN A STRANGE DESOLATE NOISY BUSY PLACE WITH DIMINISHED COMFORTS ON EVERY SIDE OF THE HOME LIFE
THOUGH HOW THE WORDS WOULD COME OUT AFTER ALL THIS TERRIBLE PAUSE FOR REFLECTION AND SELF-REPROACH WITHOUT BETRAYING HER FALSEHOOD SHE DID NOT KNOW SHE COULD NOT TELL
I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS A MAN ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED OF
PRESENTLY THE GENTLEMEN CAME UP MR COLTHURST AND MR THORNTON IN CLOSE CONVERSATION
SHE LAUGHED IN MY FACE WHEN I PRAISED HER FOR SPEAKING OUT SOMETHING MR BELL HAD SAID IN YOUR FAVOUR
HAS DIXON SAID ANYTHING
I WENT TO HIM MYSELF TO TRY IF THAT WOULD DO
NO JANE IF YOU DON'T GO I DO MRS THORNTON WENT FIRST TO THE ROOM IN WHICH SHE HAD LEFT FANNY STRETCHED ON THE BED
HER CHEEKS BURNT AS SHE RECOLLECTED HOW PROUDLY SHE HAD IMPLIED AN OBJECTION TO TRADE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE BECAUSE IT TOO OFTEN LED TO THE DECEIT OF PASSING OFF INFERIOR FOR SUPERIOR GOODS IN THE ONE BRANCH
MRS HALE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT
AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS GLANCE INSTINCTIVELY SOUGHT HERS AS IF HE WANTED HER SYMPATHY
IT WAS WRONG DISOBEDIENT FAITHLESS
AND HOW THEN WOULD IT HAVE AFFECTED HER FATHER
IT'S NOT DEATH YET BUT DEATH IS NOT FAR OFF
THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PLENTIFUL LUXURY OF ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS THE STATELY HANDSOMENESS OF THE FURNITURE THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE THE PEACEFUL UNTROUBLED EASE OF THE VISITORS--ALL CAME VIVIDLY BEFORE HER IN STRANGE CONTRAST TO THE PRESENT TIME
BUT AFTER IT WAS OVER SHE WENT QUIETLY ROUND TO ONE OR TWO OLD FAVOURITES AND TALKED TO THEM A LITTLE
PAPA WE WILL GO AND SEE THEM IN SPAIN HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND THE END IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL IT WAS ALL VERY WELL
THY LAYING ASIDE AS WELL AS THY CONTINUANCE IN THY WORK
THE GIRL LOOKED WISTFULLY AT THE FLOWERS AND ACTING ON A SUDDEN IMPULSE MARGARET OFFERED THEM TO HER
IF MISS BERESFORD HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY TO MARRY A POOR COUNTRY CLERGYMAN THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE BECOME
NOT BUT WHAT SHE SHRUNK WITH FASTIDIOUS PRIDE FROM THEIR HAIL-FELLOW ACCOST AND SEVERELY RESENTED THEIR UNCONCEALED CURIOSITY AS TO THE MEANS AND POSITION OF ANY FAMILY WHO LIVED IN MILTON AND YET WERE NOT ENGAGED IN TRADE OF SOME KIND
AT LAST SHE SAT STRAIGHT STIFF UP ON THE SOFA AND TURNING ROUND TO HER DAUGHTER SHE SAID WITH TEARFUL ALMOST SOLEMN EARNESTNESS MARGARET IF I CAN GET BETTER,--IF GOD LETS ME HAVE A CHANCE OF RECOVERY IT MUST BE THROUGH SEEING MY SON FREDERICK ONCE MORE
FOR TO TELL THE TRUTH HE HAD RATHER FORCED HIMSELF UP TO HARLEY STREET THIS EVENING WITH A VIEW OF GETTING OVER AN AWKWARD MEETING AWKWARD EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN LENNOX AND EDITH AND DOUBLY AWKWARD NOW THAT HE FOUND HER THE ONLY LADY THERE AND THE PERSON TO WHOM HE MUST NATURALLY AND PERFORCE ADDRESS A GREAT PART OF HIS CONVERSATION
IF I THOUGHT HE LOVED HER PROPERLY I MIGHT GET TO LOVE HIM IN TIME
BUT THIS GIRL WHO TURNS UP HER NOSE AT US ALL--WHO TURNS UP HER NOSE AT YOU NAY MOTHER
THESE POOR FRIENDS WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY SHE HAD FORSAKEN THEM
HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT SHE SAID
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE WAS AN OLD MAN SO LATELY EXULTANT IN THE FULL STRENGTH OF MANHOOD
WHO DO YOU THINK CAME UP IN THE TRAIN WITH ME I DON'T KNOW SAID MARGARET RESOLVED AGAINST MAKING A GUESS
SHE WOULD SEE
BUT MARGARET WAS THE FIRST TO HEAR THE STOPPING OF THE CAB THAT BROUGHT HER AUNT FROM THE RAILWAY STATION
THE LADIES FOR THE MOST PART WERE SILENT EMPLOYING THEMSELVES IN TAKING NOTES OF THE DINNER AND CRITICISING EACH OTHER'S DRESSES
THE GAY NEW LIFE OPENING UPON HER
AND I DESIRE YOU NOT TO TELL ME OH VERY WELL
HAVE YO HEERD AUGHT OF MISS MARGET LATELY MISS--WHO REPLIED MR THORNTON
MR HALE GOT INTO THE HABIT OF QUOTING HIS OPINIONS SO FREQUENTLY AND WITH SUCH REGARD THAT IT BECAME A LITTLE DOMESTIC JOKE TO WONDER WHAT TIME DURING THE HOUR APPOINTED FOR INSTRUCTION COULD BE GIVEN TO ABSOLUTE LEARNING SO MUCH OF IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SPENT IN CONVERSATION
BUT THESE FACTORY PEOPLE WHO ON EARTH WEARS COTTON THAT CAN AFFORD LINEN WELL MAMMA I GIVE UP THE COTTON-SPINNERS
MRS BOUCHER WAS VERY ILL
NO POWER OF ACTION SCARCELY CHANGE OF MOVEMENT
SHE MUST BE TOLD THOUGH NOW SAID HE LOOKING WISTFULLY AT HIS DAUGHTER
I COULD NOT BEFORE--I DARED NOT SHE SAT STILL IN HER CHAIR HER HANDS CLASPED ON HER KNEES HER LIPS COMPRESSED HER EYES FIXED AS ONE WHO SEES A VISION
MARGARET WAS HESITATING WHETHER SHE SHOULD SAY WHAT WAS IN HER MIND
HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT AT ANY RATE
WHAT COULD YOU DO IF HE WERE TAKEN AWAY
EVERY NOW AND THEN MARGARET HAD TO REMIND HERSELF OF HER FATHER'S REGARD FOR MR THORNTON TO SUBDUE THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS THAT WAS STEALING OVER HER AND BRINGING ON ONE OF THE BAD HEADACHES TO WHICH SHE HAD LATELY BECOME LIABLE
MISS HALE WOULD NOT HAVE ME
BUT WHERE'S YOUR FATHER MARY MARY SHOOK HER HEAD AND STOOD UP TO BE GOING
ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING--WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
BUT HERE HE WAS WHEN I CAME DOWN JUST BEFORE NINE
NO SAID DIXON
A GOOD DEAL OF HIS CAPITAL WAS LOCKED UP IN NEW AND EXPENSIVE MACHINERY
HOW LITTLE WE CAN DO FOR HER AND YET WE DARE NOT LEAVE HER WITHOUT OUR EFFORTS ALTHOUGH THEY MAY SEEM SO USELESS
AND WE HAD AN ALARM JUST AFTER HER DEATH FOR DIXON MET SOME ONE IN MILTON--A MAN CALLED LEONARDS--WHO HAD KNOWN FRED AND WHO SEEMED TO OWE HIM A GRUDGE OR AT ANY RATE TO BE TEMPTED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF THE REWARD OFFERED FOR HIS APPREHENSION
IT LOOMED THROUGH THE FOG LIKE A GREAT BARRIER TO HOPE
DON'T TELL ME SAID MRS HALE SHUDDERING UP AND WRAPPING HER SHAWL ABOUT HER STILL MORE CLOSELY
SHE MUST BE PATIENT
THE OLD MAN THE INHABITANT OF THE RUINOUS COTTAGE WAS DEAD
WHILE SHE IN REPLY GAVE HIM MUCH CREDIT FOR BEING SO FRESH AND YOUNG UNDER HIS FELLOW'S CAP AND GOWN
WHITE MOTIONLESS SPEECHLESS TEARLESS
SHE LAY CURLED UP ON THE SOFA IN THE BACK DRAWING-ROOM IN HARLEY STREET LOOKING VERY LOVELY IN HER WHITE MUSLIN AND BLUE RIBBONS
MARGARET LAY MOTIONLESS AND ALMOST BREATHLESS BY HIM
MARGARET WAS SO UNCONSCIOUS OF HERSELF AND SO MUCH AMUSED BY WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE THAT SHE NEVER THOUGHT WHETHER SHE WAS LEFT UNNOTICED OR NOT
I NOBBUT WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY'D GETTEN HIM CLEARED NOT THAT I KNOW OF
THE IDEA OF HER HUSBAND'S AND DAUGHTER'S GOING TO THIS DINNER HAD QUITE CAPTIVATED MRS HALE'S FANCY EVEN BEFORE MARGARET HAD HEARD THE CONTENTS OF THE NOTE
AND HE WAS PROUD OF THE SENSE OF JUSTICE WHICH MADE HIM GO ON IN EVERY KINDNESS HE COULD OFFER TO HER PARENTS
THE VERIEST IDIOT WHO OBEYS HIS OWN SIMPLE LAW OF RIGHT IF IT BE BUT IN WIPING HIS SHOES ON A DOOR-MAT IS WISER AND STRONGER THAN I
HOW WAS IT THAT HE HAUNTED HER IMAGINATION SO PERSISTENTLY
SO ONE DAY TWO OR THREE OF THE MEN--MY FRIEND HIGGINS AMONG THEM--ASKED ME IF I WOULD NOT COME IN AND TAKE A SNACK
TIME AND SPACE WERE NOT THOUGH ALL OTHER THINGS SEEMED REAL
BUT HE COULD NOT HELP GOING UP TO HER AS SHE STOOD A LITTLE ASIDE RENDERED TIMID BY THE UNCERTAINTY OF HIS MANNER OF LATE AND SAYING THE FEW NECESSARY COMMON-PLACE WORDS IN SO TENDER A VOICE THAT HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AND SHE TURNED AWAY TO HIDE HER EMOTION
ONLY LET ME HOPE
THE CLOUDS ON HER MOTHER'S BROW HAD CLEARED OFF UNDER THE PROPITIOUS INFLUENCE OF A BRACE OF CARP MOST OPPORTUNELY PRESENTED BY A NEIGHBOUR
H
H
H
THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR MAMMA IS TO GET HER ROOM QUITE READY FOR HER TO GO TO BED WHILE I GO AND BRING HER A CUP OF COFFEE MR HALE WAS EQUALLY OUT OF SPIRITS AND EQUALLY CAME UPON MARGARET FOR SYMPATHY
PAPA FELT SO ACUTELY--YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT STRONG AND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH TERRIBLE SUSPENSE TO GO THROUGH WHEN DID HE TELL YOU MARGARET YESTERDAY ONLY YESTERDAY REPLIED MARGARET DETECTING THE JEALOUSY WHICH PROMPTED THE INQUIRY
AND IF YOU DON'T HATE HER I DO THEN MOTHER YOU MAKE ME LOVE HER MORE
SHOLTO WAS TAUGHT TO CARRY AUNT MARGARET'S CUP OF TEA VERY CAREFULLY TO HER
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE THE MISERY--THAT HE PASSIONATELY LOVED HER AND THOUGHT HER EVEN WITH ALL HER FAULTS MORE LOVELY AND MORE EXCELLENT THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN
MR LENNOX WAS OUT OF TOWN
THEREFORE IT IS MY CREDITORS MONEY THAT I SHOULD RISK BUT IF IT SUCCEEDED THEY NEED NEVER KNOW
I THINK MARGARET SHE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE IN A WEAK TREMBLING EXHAUSTED VOICE I AM GLAD OF IT--I AM PROUDER OF FREDERICK STANDING UP AGAINST INJUSTICE THAN IF HE HAD BEEN SIMPLY A GOOD OFFICER I AM SURE I AM SAID MARGARET IN A FIRM DECIDED TONE
SHE HAS TAKEN THE OPIATE I BROUGHT WITH ME
HOW DARED HE SAY THAT HE WOULD LOVE HER STILL EVEN THOUGH SHE SHOOK HIM OFF WITH CONTEMPT
WITH THE QUICK INSIGHT INTO CHARACTER WITHOUT WHICH NO MEDICAL MAN CAN RISE TO THE EMINENCE OF DR DONALDSON HE SAW THAT SHE WOULD EXACT THE FULL TRUTH
SHE TRIED TO FIND HERSELF OCCUPATION IN TEACHING THE TWO YOUNGER BOUCHER CHILDREN AND WORKED HARD AT GOODNESS
BUT I TAKE MARGARET AS MY CHILD FOR HIS SAKE
THAT'S WHERE IT SPREAD FROM CHAPTER XIX ANGEL VISITS AS ANGELS IN SOME BRIGHTER DREAMS CALL TO THE SOUL WHEN MAN DOTH SLEEP SO SOME STRANGE THOUGHTS TRANSCEND OUR WONTED THEMES AND INTO GLORY PEEP HENRY VAUGHAN
SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY MY DEAR SAID MR HALE ALARMED
BUT THEY LEARNT THIS TIME FROM AN OFFICIOUS NEIGHBOUR THAT HE WAS REALLY FROM HOME
HER SALLOW CHEEK FLUSHED AND HER EYE LIGHTENED AS SHE ANSWERED
BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS MORISON IS NO TRUE MAN
IT WERE YOU AS GETTEN ME THE PLACE AND I THANK YO FOR IT
YOU HAVE TURNED QUITE PALE MARGARET DID NOT REFUSE TO GO THOUGH SHE WAS LOTH TO LEAVE HER FATHER ALONE
SHE USED TO KISS ME AND THEN LOOK IN MY FACE TO BE SURE I WAS THE RIGHT PERSON AND THEN SET TO AGAIN
BUT WAS IT DECOROUS--WAS IT
THEN HE MAY BE HERE--HERE IN TWENTY-TWO DAYS
MARGARET REMEMBERED IT WELL
BUT HER FATHER WAS IN TOO DEPRESSED A STATE OF MIND AND BODY TO STRUGGLE HEALTHILY
BUT AS MR HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
D
I MUST BE OFF IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR MRS THORNTON LEFT THE ROOM
TO TAKE MRS THORNTON'S PLACE AS MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE WAS ONLY ONE OF THE RICH CONSEQUENCES WHICH DECKED OUT THE SUPREME GLORY
YO'D BE THERE THEN WERE YO ASKED BESSY LANGUIDLY FOR INDEED SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH MANY PAUSES AS IF SPEECH WAS UNUSUALLY DIFFICULT TO HER
HER FATHER WENT UP AFTER TEA TO SIT WITH HIS WIFE
THEN CALMING DOWN HE SAID BREATHLESSLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HUMPH
HUMPH
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SHE SAID
AND NOW THAT MARGARET WAS THERE AND HAD TAKEN A CHAIR BY HER BESSY LAY BACK SILENT AND CONTENT TO LOOK AT MARGARET'S FACE AND TOUCH HER ARTICLES OF DRESS WITH A CHILDISH ADMIRATION OF THEIR FINENESS OF TEXTURE
I THOUGHT SHE'D HAVE DIED AN HOUR AGO MR HALE CAUGHT MARGARET'S ARM TO STEADY HIMSELF FROM FALLING
WHAT CAN YOU DO BE ALWAYS THE SAME JOHN THORNTON IN WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES
OH DEAR SHE SAID TO HER MAID
AND AS IS NATURAL THEY WANTEN THEIR SHARE O TH PROFITS NOW THAT FOOD IS GETTING DEAR
WONDERFUL SAY I TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CONCEALED SO LONG AND IN SO SMALL A COMPASS THAT I REALLY DID NOT KNOW OF YOUR EXISTENCE
LET ME BRING YOU WHAT MONEY I CAN SPARE,--LET ME BRING YOU A LITTLE FOOD FOR THAT POOR MAN'S CHILDREN
OR WOULD IT GIVE YOU TOO MUCH PAIN
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT MISS HALE'S CALL IS TO WISH US GOOD-BYE YOU ARE GOING THEN SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE
AND NOW MRS HALE COULD ROUSE HERSELF FROM HER LANGUOR AND FORGET HER REAL SUFFERING IN THINKING OF THE PLEASURE AND THE DELIGHT OF GOING TO THE SEA-SIDE
NOT HUMBLED BEFORE GOD AS HAVING FAILED IN TRUST TOWARDS HIM
ONLY I SHALL HAVE TO USE A WHOLE EXPLANATORY SENTENCE INSTEAD I DON'T LIKE THIS MILTON SAID MRS HALE
I SHOULD LIKE TO READ YOU SOME REMARKS IN A BOOK I HAVE HE GOT UP AND WENT TO HIS BOOK-SHELVES
FREDERICK HELD HER HAND IN HIS AND LOOKED WITH WISTFUL ANXIETY INTO HER FACE READING THERE MORE CARE AND TROUBLE THAN SHE WOULD BETRAY BY WORDS
HE FELT IT ACUTELY IN HIS VULNERABLE POINT--HIS PRIDE IN THE COMMERCIAL CHARACTER WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED FOR HIMSELF
SO WHITE AND IMMOVEABLE WAS SHE
NOT BUT WHAT MARGARET WAS REPELLED BY THE ROUGH UNCOURTEOUS MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE
YOU LOOK PALE AND TIRED
HALF AN HOUR OR MORE ELAPSED BEFORE THE CRAMPED NATURE OF HER POSITION AND THE CHILLINESS SUPERVENING UPON GREAT FATIGUE HAD THE POWER TO ROUSE HER NUMBED FACULTIES
HAD PERHAPS UNDULY FELT THEIR MORTIFICATION WHEN SHE BECAME A POOR CLERGYMAN'S WIFE;--THEY HAD BEEN SMOTHERED AND KEPT DOWN
HE INDEED
AND NOW COMES DEATH TO SNAP US ASUNDER COME COME COME
HE'D TOO MUCH MOTHER-WIT FOR THAT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE OF IDENTITY
I'LL PICK UP SOME CRAFT OR OTHER TO TAKE ME OFF NEVER FEAR
INDEED I HAD OFTEN SAID THAT I WAS SURE SHE WOULD BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE WAS NINETEEN
IT IS SO RELAXING
WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU REFER TO ABOUT RESERVATIONS IN HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING OF ME OH
YOU AND MAMMA HAVE SOME MONEY INDEPENDENT OF THE INCOME FROM THE LIVING HAVE NOT YOU
GO TO MY LITTLE JAPAN CABINET DEAR AND IN THE SECOND LEFT-HAND DRAWER YOU WILL FIND A PACKET OF LETTERS MARGARET WENT
THE MEASURED LABOURED WALK OF MEN CARRYING A HEAVY BURDEN
SHE WAS NEVER SO GRACIOUS AS WHEN RECEIVING HER SON'S FRIENDS IN HER SON'S HOUSE
MR HALE'S EVER-READY SYMPATHY WITH ANYTHING OF SHYNESS OR HESITATION OR WANT OF SELF-POSSESSION MADE HIM COME TO HIS AID
ONLY SOME PEOPLE FAINT AT THE LEAST THING I AM SORRY SHE IS GONE HOME SAID HE WALKING UNEASILY ABOUT
BUT THE FUTURE MUST BE MET HOWEVER STERN AND IRON IT BE
A HOOK TO REAP OR A SCYTHE TO MOW A FLAIL OR WHAT YE WILL AND HERE'S A READY HAND TO PLY THE NEEDFUL TOOL AND SKILL'D ENOUGH BY LESSONS ROUGH IN LABOUR'S RUGGED SCHOOL HOOD
I AM NOT STANDING UP FOR THEM ANY MORE THAN FOR ANY OTHER TRADES-PEOPLE
EVEN HARLEY STREET APPEARED MORE DISTINCT
I THINK HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST TYRANT OF ALL
AY THAT WILL I SAID BESSY RETURNING THE PRESSURE
I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HER--WICKED DAUGHTER THAT I AM MOANED FORTH MARGARET AS SHE SUPPORTED HER TREMBLING FATHER'S HASTY STEPS UP-STAIRS
TRULY IF THEY ARE TO BE SKETCHED--AND THEY ARE VERY PICTURESQUE--WE HAD BETTER NOT PUT IT OFF TILL NEXT YEAR
IT IS A FINE DAY AND GOOD FOR THE HARVEST I HOPE
TH STONE WERE MEANT FOR THEE
I SAID YOU HAD A HUMAN RIGHT
THERE IS A CROSS IN EVERY LOT AND AN EARNEST NEED FOR PRAYER ANON
BUT NOW THIS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER LITTLE IRREGULARITIES SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THEIR POWER OF IRRITATION AND MARGARET ALMOST LONGED FOR THE OLD COMPLAININGS
HE WHO WAS THE FARTHEST ON THE SPAR FEELING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PASSING HIS COMPANIONS AND YET PASSIONATELY DREADING THE DISGRACE OF THE FLOGGING THREW HIMSELF DESPERATELY DOWN TO CATCH A ROPE CONSIDERABLY LOWER FAILED AND FELL SENSELESS ON DECK
BLESS YO MISS IT WILL BE A KIND ACT
SHE BEGAN TO CONSIDER HOW DESIRABLE SOMETHING OF THE KIND WOULD BE TO HER FATHER WHOSE SPIRITS ALWAYS FEEBLE NOW BECAME TOO FREQUENTLY DEPRESSED AND WHOSE HEALTH THOUGH HE NEVER COMPLAINED HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY HIS WIFE'S ILLNESS AND DEATH
WHY SHE WENT ON WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE FARMERS HE PUFFED AWAY
YO'RE NOT OF THIS COUNTRY I RECKON NO SAID MARGARET HALF SIGHING
AND SHE DARED NOT STIR
THEN THERE WAS A MAN'S FOOTSTEP RUNNING DOWN STAIRS
STILL HE COULD SMILE NOW--RATHER SLOWLY RATHER FAINTLY IT IS TRUE
MARGARET REPROACHED HERSELF ACUTELY AS THE CAUSE OF HIS DISTRESS
ONE DAY AFTER THE GENTLEMEN HAD COME UP INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM MR LENNOX DREW NEAR TO MARGARET AND ADDRESSED HER IN ALMOST THE FIRST VOLUNTARY WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER SINCE SHE HAD RETURNED TO LIVE IN HARLEY STREET
AND I KNOW NOT IF I SLEPT OR WAKED OR WERE IN A DEAD SWOON TILL MARY COME IN
HERE WERE NO MIRRORS NOT EVEN A SCRAP OF GLASS TO REFLECT THE LIGHT AND ANSWER THE SAME PURPOSE AS WATER IN A LANDSCAPE
REALLY I THINK IT IS A HAPPY HIT OF HENRY'S
AND AS THEY KEPT EARLY HOURS IN THE COUNTRY PARSONAGE MARGARET HAD ALWAYS HAD HER MEALS WITH HER FATHER AND MOTHER
IT GIVES ME MORE COMFORT THAN ANY OTHER BOOK I THE BIBLE LET ME COME AND READ YOU SOME OF MY FAVOURITE CHAPTERS AY SAID SHE GREEDILY COME
ONLY DIXON CROAKED FOR EVER INTO MARGARET'S EAR
THERE IS NO WOMAN TO SHIELD ME HERE
SHE DID NOT THINK FAR ENOUGH FOR THAT IN HER PRESENT EXCITED STATE
NOT ONE LOOK TO MARGARET
THE WHOLE MACHINERY--I DON'T MEAN THE WOOD AND IRON MACHINERY NOW--OF THE COTTON TRADE IS SO NEW THAT IT IS NO WONDER IF IT DOES NOT WORK WELL IN EVERY PART ALL AT ONCE
PERHAPS OUR MILTON GIRLS HAVE TOO MUCH SPIRIT AND GOOD FEELING TO GO ANGLING AFTER HUSBANDS
YOU MAY SEE THEM HUDDLED IN THAT TOP ROOM IN THE MILL,--AND THEY'RE TO SLEEP THERE TO KEEP THEM SAFE FROM THOSE BRUTES WHO WILL NEITHER WORK NOR LET THEM WORK
BUT WE DON'T THINK IT GOOD AND SO IF YO SPEND IT A-THATENS WE'LL JUST LEAVE OFF DEALING WITH YO THEY DUNNOT SAY THAT DUN THEY NO
I'M RATHER AFEARD O GOING STRAIGHT THERE WITHOUT GETTING A GOOD SLEEP IN THE GRAVE TO SET ME UP DON'T BE AFRAID BESSY SAID MARGARET LAYING HER HAND ON THE GIRL'S
THERE THEY DECLARED THEY WOULD NOT STOP
HE DID NOT SPEAK TO YOU AS HAMPER DID DID HE HE WEREN'T O'ER-CIVIL SAID NICHOLAS SPINNING THE PENNY AGAIN AS MUCH FOR HIS OWN AMUSEMENT AS FOR THAT OF THE CHILDREN
INDEED BEYOND THE MERE FACT OF FREDERICK HAVING SAILED UNDISCOVERED AND UNSUSPECTED HE DID NOT GATHER MUCH FROM THE LETTER AT THE TIME HE WAS SO UNEASY ABOUT MARGARET'S PALLID LOOKS
AND THEN TRYING TO BE BRAVE IN SETTING TO AFRESH
EVEN IN THIS SMOKY PLACE ENOUGH TO BLIND ONE'S EYES THE OWLS CAN SEE THAT
TELL HIM THERE'S SEVEN HUNDRED'LL COME MARCHING INTO MARLBOROUGH MILLS THE MORNING AFTER HE GIVES THE FIVE PER CENT AND WILL HELP HIM THROUGH HIS CONTRACT IN NO TIME
MRS SHAW HELD OUT HER HAND TO THE NEW-COMER
FREDERICK WAS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF IN THE RARE TIMES WHEN HIS NAME WAS MENTIONED AS POOR FREDERICK HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT
LONDON LIFE IS TOO WHIRLING AND FULL TO ADMIT OF EVEN AN HOUR OF THAT DEEP SILENCE OF FEELING WHICH THE FRIENDS OF JOB SHOWED WHEN THEY SAT WITH HIM ON THE GROUND SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS AND NONE SPAKE A WORD UNTO HIM
SHE SAW THAT BY THE DIRECTION OF A THOUSAND ANGRY EYES
HAD YOU EVER ANY REASON FOR THINKING THAT MR THORNTON CARED FOR YOU HE ALMOST BLUSHED AS HE PUT THIS QUESTION
I OWE IT TO YOU--SINCE IT'S MY WAY OF TALKING THAT HAS SET YOU OFF ON THIS IDEA--TO PUT IT ALL CLEAR BEFORE YOU
WHY SHOULD YOU DRESS TO GO AND TAKE A CUP OF TEA WITH AN OLD PARSON MR HALE IS A GENTLEMAN AND HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE LADIES WIFE AND DAUGHTER
IT'S SAVE AS SAVE CAN
HAVE YOU ORDERED IT NO PAPA
AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
I THANK YOU
SHE'D HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH MISS IF SHE'D STAYED IN THE DRAWING-ROOM OR COME UP TO US
I KNOW YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY WITH ME IF YOU WOULD AND I MUST TELL YOU THE TRUTH
AND GAVE HIM A DISTINGUISHED APPEARANCE FROM THE EASE OF MOTION WHICH AROSE OUT OF IT AND WAS NATURAL TO HIM
SOMETIMES SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST GIVE WAY AND CRY OUT WITH PAIN AS THE SUDDEN SHARP THOUGHT CAME ACROSS HER EVEN DURING HER APPARENTLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH HER FATHER THAT SHE HAD NO LONGER A MOTHER
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS AND IN THE DEEP MANLY SOBS WHICH WENT THROUGH THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT LIKE HEAVY PULSES OF AGONY
SHE GUESSED THE TRUTH WITH AN INSTINCTIVE FLASH
AY I'VE BEEN AT THORNTON'S AND WHAT DID HE SAY SUCH A CHAP AS ME IS NOT LIKE TO SEE THE MEASTER
IN THE MIDDLE THEY HEARD DIXON'S FOOT ON THE STAIRS
SHE KEPT WONDERING ABOUT THE DETAILS WITH SOMETHING OF THE SIMPLICITY OF A LITTLE CHILD WHO WANTS TO HAVE ALL ITS ANTICIPATED PLEASURES DESCRIBED BEFOREHAND
DOLORES MUST BE CHARMING AND THE MANTILLA WAS EXQUISITE
WAS IT NOT MARGARET MRS THORNTON DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID MY SON IS NOT THE ONE TO TELL OF HIS OWN DOINGS
I SHALL SPEAK WITH RELATION TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES I KNOW WITHOUT BEING INFLUENCED EITHER ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY THE STRONG REASONS WHICH YOU WILL NOT CONFIDE TO ME
AND FROM EACH SIDE OF THE DOOR THERE WERE CONSTANT DROPPINGS
AT ANY RATE I AM SURE HE WILL LET YOU KNOW IF HE CANNOT A STRIKE ASKED MARGARET
THERE'S MANY AND MANY A ONE WISER AND SCORES BETTER LEARNED THAN I AM AROUND ME,--FOLK WHO'VE HAD TIME TO THINK ON THESE THINGS,--WHILE MY TIME HAS HAD TO BE GI'EN UP TO GETTING MY BREAD
I ONLY MEAN BESSY THERE'S GOOD AND BAD IN EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD
AND MR BELL WAS FAIN TO RESORT TO HIS FORMER OCCUPATION OF TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW HE COULD BEST BREAK THE NEWS TO MARGARET
REMEMBER THE MISFORTUNES THAT ENSUED
MR THORNTON HAD THOUGHT THAT THE HOUSE IN CRAMPTON WAS REALLY JUST THE THING
BEYOND THAT ONE AIM SHE WOULD NOT LOOK
NO WONDER THEY FRIGHTENED YOUR MAID
THE UTTER LONELINESS OF HIS LIFE WAS INSUPPORTABLE TO THINK ABOUT
TO MOVE HAND OR FOOT OR EVEN SO MUCH AS ONE FINGER WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXERTION BEYOND THE POWERS OF EITHER VOLITION OR MOTION
I'VE A LONG ROUND TO TAKE
NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS
AT LAST HE TOO FELL ASLEEP AND ALL THE HOUSE WAS STILL
HER BEAUTIFUL LIP CURLED IN A SLIGHT DISDAIN
SHE KEPT HER EYES UPON HIM IN THE SAME DULL FIXED MANNER UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY OUT OF THE HOUSE
I'M VERY WICKED
YOU CAN'T HELP THAT MY ENEMIES IF I HAVE ANY MAY MAKE A PHILANTHROPIC FUSS ABOUT THIS DINNER-SCHEME
HIS EYES WERE FAILING AND HE GLADLY ACCEPTED HER PROPOSAL
BUT SHE HELD IT IN HER HAND AND LOOKED AT IT AS IF SHE WERE INTENTLY STUDYING IT
HER HEART FLUTTERED IF HIS DID NOT AT THIS INTERVIEW
AND YET THE CAREFUL AVOIDANCE OF HIS EYES BETOKENED THAT IN SOME WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE IF THEY FELL BY CHANCE THEY WOULD REST ON HER
BUT YOU'LL ONLY PUZZLE YOURSELF IF YOU DO THAT'S ONE COMFORT YO'RE NOT LIKE NO ONE I EVER SEED
AND HE MIGHT HAVE COME TO SEE HIGGINS AND FOR THE OLD FRIENDSHIP'S SAKE SHE SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN HIM TO-NIGHT
HE WAS SO LANGUID THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL HIS THOUGHTS
SO TH OUD GENTLEMAN'S AWAY ON HIS TRAVELS IS HE SAID HE
ONE OF MY MOTHER'S SERVANTS WAS ENGAGED TO HIM I BELIEVE AND SHE IS IN GREAT DISTRESS TO-DAY
AND THAT AT THE VERY TIME WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE SET OUT FOR LONDON HE HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH AN APOPLECTIC FIT
MRS HALE SAID THAT THE NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SO MANY TREES AFFECTED HER HEALTH
SHE STOPPED HER CRYING AND OPENED HER BEDROOM DOOR
IS IT VERY HOT MARGARET VERY HOT AND THE STREETS ARE RATHER ROUGH WITH THE STRIKE MARGARET'S COLOUR CAME BACK VIVID AND BRIGHT AS EVER
MRS SHAW OBJECTED
AND I THINK PAPA THAT I COULD GET MAMMA TO HELP ME IN PLANNING IF YOU COULD TELL ME WHAT TO PLAN FOR
EVEN THIS MORNING HOW MAGNIFICENT SHE HAD LOOKED,--HER EYES FLASHING OUT UPON HIM AT THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE SHE HAD SHARED HIS DANGER YESTERDAY SHE HAD CARED FOR HIM THE LEAST
WHAT MUST WE DO ASKED HE
HE HAS DOUBTS YOU SAY AND GIVES UP HIS LIVING AND ALL WITHOUT CONSULTING ME
THE NOTE CONTAINS THE ADDRESS YOU ASKED FOR
SHE SAW IT IN DREAMS MORE VIVID THAN LIFE AND AS SHE FELL AWAY TO SLUMBER AT NIGHTS HER MEMORY WANDERED IN ALL ITS PLEASANT PLACES
MARGARET BROUGHT OUT HER DRAWING MATERIALS FOR HIM TO CHOOSE FROM
I WOULD RATHER STAY AT HOME WITH YOU,--MUCH RATHER MAMMA NONSENSE DARLING
I EVEN GATHER THIS IMPRESSION FROM WHAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME SAID MR THORNTON PAUSED AWHILE BEFORE HE SPOKE
HE HAD THE GOUT
YOU DO NOT KNOW MY SON
HE HAD BEEN GETTING IMPATIENT AT THE LOSS OF HIS TIME ON A MARKET-DAY THE MOMENT BEFORE SHE APPEARED YET NOW HE CALMLY TOOK A SEAT AT HER BIDDING
I MAY HAVE TO SUMMON YOU TO APPEAR ON THE INQUEST AND PROVE AN ALIBI IF MY WITNESSES IT WAS BUT ONE WHO HAD RECOGNISED HER PERSIST IN DEPOSING TO YOUR PRESENCE AT THE UNFORTUNATE EVENT HE LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY
SHE OPENED IT AT LAST
BUT HE SPOKE WITH HIS USUAL COOLNESS TO THE OTHERS WHEN THEY SUGGESTED DIFFERENT THINGS JUST BEFORE WE CAME AWAY SO HE DID AFTER DINNER AS WELL
WHAT DO I MEAN
YO'RE A STRANGER AND A FOREIGNER AND AREN'T LIKELY TO KNOW THEIR WAYS
SHE DOESN'T SEEM OVER FOND OF YOU MARGARET I KNOW IT SAID MARGARET
OR WAS IT REALLY SO LATE
WHERE ARE THE POOR IMPORTED WORK-PEOPLE
SO LEONARDS HAS BEEN DRINKING AGAIN SAID ONE SEEMINGLY IN AUTHORITY
YOU DISOBEYED AUTHORITY--THAT WAS BAD
FREDERICK WAS AN OUTLAW
AND FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME FOR STARTING SHE FOUND HERSELF SITTING IN A RAILWAY-CARRIAGE OPPOSITE TO CAPTAIN LENNOX
THE OPIATE HAS TAKEN EFFECT
DO YOU KNOW MARGARET I REALLY BEGIN QUITE TO LIKE MR THORNTON NO ANSWER AT FIRST
MARGARET COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME LATE INTELLIGENCE OF FREDERICK UNKNOWN TO HER MOTHER WHICH WAS MAKING HER FATHER ANXIOUS AND UNEASY
EDITH WAS TERRIBLY SHOCKED AS SHE READ IT AND CRIED IN A SOBBING FRIGHTENED CHILDISH WAY MUCH TO HER HUSBAND'S DISTRESS
THAT WILL BE SEVERE ENOUGH I ONLY WISH THEY'D COTCHED BOUCHER AND HAD HIM UP BEFORE HAMPER
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD AND HOW TENDER HE WAS
AND FOR MR BELL
AND YOU SEE MOST OF THE SAILORS STUCK BY FREDERICK
COULD BE SUMMONED AT ANY MOMENT
SHE STOOD AWAITING HIS NEXT WORD WITH A COMPOSURE THAT APPEARED SUPREME
HE NEEDS SOMETHING OF THE KIND--MY DEAR LOVE TO HIM--GOD BLESS HIM
TH STRIKE'S FAILED AS WELL
YOU WERE BOTH GREAT ALLIES YEARS AGO WERE WE ASKED HE INDIFFERENTLY WITH AN APPEARANCE OF BEING INTERESTED IN A PASSAGE IN THE REVIEW
BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE SUCH A CREATURE CARES FOR ME DON'T BE FOOLISH JOHN
SO IF I GET A SHILLING SIXPENCE SHALL GO TO THEM IF THEY AXE IT FROM ME
ON THE CONTRARY HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE AND HIS SIMPLICITY WERE OFTEN UTTERLY SMOTHERED UNDER THE GLUT OF WEALTH THAT CAME DOWN UPON HIM
AFTER TEA SHE RESOLVED TO EXAMINE A LARGE PACKET OF LETTERS AND PICK OUT THOSE THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED
LOOK--THERE HE IS--I MUST GO AND SPEAK TO HIM
TH O'ERLOOKER BID ME GO AND BE D D I WISH YOU HAD SEEN MR THORNTON SAID MR HALE
I GAVE HIM AS GOOD AS I GOT
BRINGING HIMSELF TO UNDERSTAND THAT HER PLACE SHOULD KNOW HER NO MORE
BUT I'M OUT O WORK A THE SAME WE OWE MARY SOME MONEY SAID MR HALE BEFORE MARGARET'S SHARP PRESSURE ON HIS ARM COULD ARREST THE WORDS
THIS IS THE LETTER
IT MIGHT NOT BE SO I DARE SAY IF I UNDERSTOOD THE KIND OF FEELING YOU DESCRIBE
AND WHEN THE TENSION OF MIND RELATING TO THEIR DAILY AFFAIRS WAS OVER THEY SUNK INTO FALLOW REST UNTIL NEXT MORNING
HER SERVANTS WONDERED AT HER DIRECTIONS USUALLY SO SHARPLY-CUT AND DECIDED NOW CONFUSED AND UNCERTAIN
I WERE UNEASY IN MY MIND AT KNOWING THAT BAD LEONARDS WAS IN TOWN
SHE WAS GLAD WHEN THE GENTLEMEN CAME NOT MERELY BECAUSE SHE CAUGHT HER FATHER'S EYE TO BRIGHTEN HER SLEEPINESS UP
WHAT'S THE RIGHT NAME FOR A COUSIN-IN-LAW'S BROTHER MR HENRY LENNOX ASKED MARGARET
BUT THE DRAWING-ROOM WAS NOT LIKE THIS
THE LAST VIBRATION NOW IS O'ER AND THEY WHO LISTENED ARE NO MORE
AND THEN SHE SANK AS IF WEARIED BY THE EXERTION
SHE HAS CAUSED DISTURBANCE ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT FOR HER ARE YOU BECOME SO HELPLESS AS TO HAVE TO BE DEFENDED BY A GIRL ASKED MRS THORNTON SCORNFULLY
AND WE MUST CONSOLE OURSELVES WITH BEING GLAD THAT FREDERICK IS SO HAPPY AND WITH BEING A GREAT DEAL TO EACH OTHER
AND MONEY BEING SCARCE HE COULD ONLY BORROW AT EXORBITANT INTEREST AND YET HE COULD NOT REALISE ANY OF HIS PROPERTY
AND THERE WE'LL DINE--IT WILL BE BUT DOE-VENISON IF WE CAN GET IT AT ALL--AND THEN I'LL TAKE MY NAP WHILE YOU GO OUT AND SEE OLD FRIENDS
IT WAS A SOFTENING EMPLOYMENT AND SHE HAD TO BRUSH AWAY THE UNBIDDEN TEARS AS MRS THORNTON WAS ANNOUNCED
BESIDES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT
GOOD AFTERNOON MR HALE
ALL THIS FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND AND I SAID IT WAS NOT ME
I BELIEVE SHE ADMIRES IT THE MORE FOR THOSE VERY QUALITIES IF IT HAS BEEN MRS THORNTON'S HOME FOR SOME YEARS I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND HER LOVING IT SAID MARGARET IN HER CLEAR BELL-LIKE VOICE
THIS STATE OF TRANQUILLITY COULD NOT ENDURE FOR MANY DAYS NOR PERHAPS FOR MANY HOURS
BUT SHE WERE YOUNGER THAN ME STILL HE PONDERED OVER THE EVENT NOT LOOKING AT MARGARET THOUGH HE GRASPED HER TIGHT
HER FATHER WAS MY OLDEST FRIEND AND SHE'S MY GOD-DAUGHTER SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST COME DOWN TOGETHER AND SEE THE OLD PLACE
THERE MIGHT BE A WAY OPEN PERHAPS BY MY OFFERING TO MARRY THAT WORTHY LADY
SHE WILL BE HERE
AND SO DRAWN THE ARGUMENT UPON HIMSELF WHILE SHE SATE SILENT BY WITH A SLIGHT FEELING OF CONTEMPT
BY AND BYE MR BELL PEERED AT HIM TO DISCOVER WHAT MANNER OF MAN IT WAS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVING HIS EMOTION
MRS SHAW ENJOYED THE ROMANCE OF THE PRESENT ENGAGEMENT RATHER MORE THAN HER DAUGHTER
HE STOPPED IN MID CAREER
SHE WAS WONDERING WHETHER AN EXPLANATION OF ANY KIND WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HER LOYALTY TO FREDERICK
THEY DON'T CARE FOR US OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE OFFERED TO GO HIMSELF AND NOT HAVE PROPOSED THIS SENDING AN EMPTY CARRIAGE I THOUGHT YOU WERE SO EXTREMELY AVERSE TO HIS GOING MARGARET SAID MR HALE IN SOME SURPRISE
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE FIT TO GIVE A DIRECTION OF ANY KIND AND THERE IS SO MUCH TO BE DONE
AS SOON AS THE EFFORT CEASED HIS TRUST DROPPED DOWN DEAD AND POWERLESS
I DO FEEL OFFENDED
I AM ONLY AFRAID I HAVE THOUGHT AND WISHED TOO MUCH--IN THAT ABSORBING WILFUL WAY WHICH IS SURE TO BE DISAPPOINTED--OR ELSE GRATIFIED TO THE LETTER WHILE IN THE SPIRIT IT GIVES NO PLEASURE BUT THAT'S SUPERSTITIOUS I'M SURE MARGARET NO I DON'T THINK IT IS
SO SHE SPOKE TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD TAKEN THE LEAD IN PLACING MRS BOUCHER ON THE FLOOR
OUR BUSINESS BEING YO UNDERSTAND TO TAKE THE BATED WAGE AND BE THANKFUL AND THEIR BUSINESS TO BATE US DOWN TO CLEMMING POINT TO SWELL THEIR PROFITS
BUT LOOKING AT MR LENNOX WITH A BRIGHT AMUSED FACE AS IF SURE OF HIS SYMPATHY IN HER SENSE OF THE LUDICROUSNESS AT BEING THUS SURPRISED
IN SOME DEGREE TO REMEDY THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT VARIOUS SHORT PASSAGES HAVE BEEN INSERTED AND SEVERAL NEW CHAPTERS ADDED
MR THORNTON CAME TRUE TO HIS TIME
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME CERTAINLY SAID SHE SMILING UP IN HIS FACE THE EXPRESSION OF WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS AND OPPRESSED AND HARDLY CLEARED AWAY AS HE MET HER SWEET SUNNY COUNTENANCE OUT OF WHICH ALL THE NORTH-WIND EFFECT OF THEIR DISCUSSION HAD ENTIRELY VANISHED
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
TO BE SURE
NE'ER MEETS A MAN BOUT AN OATH OR A CURSE
AND I DID NA LIKE TO BE RECKONED NESH AND SOFT AND MARY'S SCHOOLING WERE TO BE KEPT UP MOTHER SAID AND FATHER HE WERE ALWAYS LIKING TO BUY BOOKS AND GO TO LECTURES O ONE KIND OR ANOTHER--ALL WHICH TOOK MONEY--SO I JUST WORKED ON TILL I SHALL NE'ER GET THE WHIRR OUT O MY EARS OR THE FLUFF OUT O MY THROAT I THIS WORLD
AND FELT THAT SHE MIGHT LET HER THOUGHTS ROAM WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING SUDDENLY WANTED TO FILL UP A GAP
BUT HE MUST BE PERPLEXED IF THE AFFAIR HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE LEAST EXPLAINED
HE WAS LEANING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND HIS ARM RESTING ON HIS KNEE
AND HE FELL BACK INTO DREAMY GLOOM
BUT THERE WAS NO FEAR OR DOUBT EXPRESSED IN IT EITHER OF HIM OR OF HIS COMPLIANCE
AND HAD IN IT NO DOGGEDNESS NO VINDICTIVENESS
SEE IF THEY DON'T COME AND BEG US TO COME BACK AT OUR OWN PRICE
I CANNOT DECIDE TO-NIGHT WEARILY SHE WENT TO BED WEARILY SHE AROSE IN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS TIME
WE'VE BEEN GREAT FRIENDS BOUT THE SOUND O MONEY PASSING BETWEEN US FOR THE CHILDREN--FOR BOUCHER'S CHILDREN SAID MARGARET HURRIEDLY
JUST READ IT MARGARET
THAT HE WOULD DWELL ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS SON'S HAVING CAUSED THE DEATH OF A MAN HOWEVER UNWITTINGLY AND UNWILLINGLY
THE STONE FACINGS--THE LONG NARROW WINDOWS AND THE NUMBER OF THEM--THE FLIGHTS OF STEPS UP TO THE FRONT DOOR ASCENDING FROM EITHER SIDE AND GUARDED BY RAILING--ALL WITNESSED TO ITS AGE
I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU
