THE MINIATURE WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE LOCKET--ON PURPOSE TO DESTROY IT
I DON'T KNOW I JUST SUSPECT IT
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT ME SO FOR JOYCE OH NOTHING
I CAN'T GO AND SCRAPE UP AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A PERFECTLY STRANGE PERSON AND SHE MAY LIVE IN TIMBUCTOO OBJECTED JOYCE
THE HIGH FOUR-POSTER WAS TOSSED AND TUMBLED NOT HOWEVER AS IF BY A NIGHT'S SLEEP BUT MORE AS IF SOME ONE HAD LAIN UPON IT JUST AS IT WAS TWISTING AND TURNING RESTLESSLY
BUT TO GO BACK,--I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN,--I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH
THE TENSION OF SUSPENSE AND TERROR HAD BEEN VERY REAL
ISN'T IT THE PRETTIEST THING YOU EVER SAW CRIED JOYCE IN AN ECSTASY OF ADMIRATION
WE'D BETTER MEET THEM AND FACE IT OUT JOYCE COULD ONLY MARVEL AT HER ASTONISHING COOLNESS WHO HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST TIMID AND TERROR-RIDDEN OF MORTALS
THE GIRLS SURVEYED THE BEWILDERING ROWS OF BOOKS PUZZLED WHERE TO BEGIN
PRESENTLY HE BEGAN TO SHIVER SO WITH SOME SORT OF A CHILL THAT I TOOK OFF MY COAT AND WRAPPED IT ROUND HIM
AND IF HE EVER DISCOVERED WHO I WAS I WOULDN'T BE ASHAMED TO TELL HIM WHAT WE HAD DONE ANYWAY
HOW THE TIME HAS GONE RELUCTANTLY ENOUGH THEY HUNTED UP GOLIATH WHO IN THOROUGH BOREDOM HAD RETURNED TO HIS PLACE ON THE HEARTH-RUG IN THE BIG BEDROOM GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR CANDLES AND FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE CELLAR
AND AFTER THAT THE OWNER SHUT THE HOUSE AND BOARDED IT UP AND WENT AWAY NEVER STOPPING TO CLEAR UP OR PUT THINGS TO RIGHTS
I ONLY HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE US THUS ENDED CYNTHIA BROKENLY AND MRS COLLINGWOOD PUT OUT HER HANDS TO TAKE A HAND OF EACH GIRL IN HER CLASP
YES BUT WHAT A STRANGE PLACE FOR IT--BACK OF THOSE SHELVES THEY BROUGHT ANOTHER CANDLE AND EXAMINED THE WALL BACK OF THE SHELVES MORE CAREFULLY
WHY NOT INQUIRED JOYCE WITH PRETENDED SURPRISE AT THE SAME TIME DECORATING THE CORNERS OF HER DIAGRAM WITH CHERUBIC HEADS AND WINGS
AND THAT ALL ITS OLD BELONGINGS HAD LONG SINCE BEEN SENT TO MY MOTHER OR SOLD BY HER ORDERS
THEN YOU CAN WARRANT I LISTENED WITH ALL MY EARS
HERE GOES SHE SLIPPED IN FEET FIRST LET HERSELF DOWN HUNG ON TO THE SILL A MOMENT THEN DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
THEN IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WAS STAYING AT THE WALDORF-ASTORIA FOR ONLY A FEW DAYS AS HE WAS JUST HERE ON SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS AND WAS THEN GOING TO CROSS THE CONTINENT ON HIS WAY BACK TO AUSTRALIA
I CAN'T FIND IT
HE'S SITTING ON AN OLD NEWSPAPER I THINK SAID JOYCE
TURNING TO THEIR LEFT THEY WENT DOWN THE NARROW ONE PEERING ABOUT THEM EAGERLY
WHO'S STOPPING AND STARING NOW THE TROUBLE IS SAID JOYCE SLOWLY THAT THE WHOLE THING'S NOT VERY CLEAR IN MY MIND
WHAT A FUNNY LITTLE DAUGHTER IT IS HE KISSED HER LAUGHINGLY AS SHE BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT
THEN AFTER A MOMENT,--"NO I'LL TELL YOU IN THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
SHE WAS WILD FOR MORNING TO COME SO THAT SHE COULD TELL CYNTHIA AND WILDER WITH IMPATIENCE TO THINK OF THE LONG DRAGGING MONTH AHEAD BEFORE THE VISIT TO GREAT-AUNT LUCIA AND THE SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY
WHY I WAS SO AFRAID YOU'D THINK ME SILLY AND--AND MEDDLING AND YOU MIGHTN'T APPROVE OF IT
YOU SEE I'D ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HIM AS THE BOY WHOM GREAT-AUNT LUCIA DESCRIBED HAVING SEEN
AND HERE JOYCE PAUSED DRAMATICALLY,--"NOT ONE OF THEM EXCEPT MY GREAT-AUNT'S FRIEND MRS DURAND EVER SAW HER AGAIN BUT--BUT BEGAN CYNTHIA
I WAS UNHAPPY,--I--SOMEHOW FELT AS THOUGH I'D COMMITTED A CRIME AND THE ONLY WAY TO RIGHT IT WAS THIS HOW LONG AGO DID YOU SEND YOUR LETTER ASKED JOYCE PRESENTLY
AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY BROKE INTO A PEAL OF HYSTERICAL GIGGLES
AND OH CYNTHIA ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL WITH THOSE BIG BROWN EYES
THE LOVELY LADY MUST HAVE LOCKED IT OR THE DISGRACEFUL RELATIVE MAY HAVE DONE IT OR SOME ONE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
IT WOULD BE DARK AND MUSTY AND DIRTY
ONE SEEMED TO CONTAIN HOUSEHOLD LINEN ONCE FINE AND DAINTY AND WHITE NOW YELLOWED AND COVERED WITH THE DUST OF YEARS
I FEEL EXACTLY AS YOU DO ABOUT IT THOUGH I DON'T OFTEN SPEAK OF IT SAID CYNTHIA
HERE IS THE VERY DRESS OF THE PICTURE-LADY THIS QUEER CHANGEABLE SILK THESE BIG SLEEVES AND THE VELVET SEWED ON IN A FUNNY CRISS-CROSS PATTERN
JUST THINK CYNTHIA OF THIS PLACE STANDING SHUT UP AND UNTOUCHED AND LONELY ALL THAT TIME
NOW I'M GOING TO LIGHT THE CANDLES IN THE LOCKED-UP ROOM THAT'S THE ONE THING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND PROTESTED JOYCE AS THEY CLIMBED THE TINY STAIRS ONCE MORE
OUGHT WE TO READ IT JOYCE
TROOPS RUSHING TO WASHINGTON WHY CYNTHIA IT WOULD SURELY HAVE GIVEN US THE CLUE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE DECLARED CYNTHIA SCEPTICALLY
WHAT DID YOU ASK ABOUT POCKET-MONEY FOR
I NEVER KNEW HER TO BE QUITE SO FOOLISH
OF WHAT USE FOR ME THEN I THOUGHT TO SUE FOR A RECONCILIATION AT SUCH A TIME
THERE WAS CERTAINLY A KEYHOLE--A RATHER SMALL ONE--AND AROUND IT WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE PANELING OF A DOOR ONLY PARTIALLY VISIBLE THROUGH THE SHREDS OF OLD TORN WALL-PAPER THAT HAD ONCE COVERED IT
INTO THE FIRST THEY ENTERED
WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT HAVE MADE DEMANDED CYNTHIA
THEN THEY KNEW
ON HOLDING THEM CLOSE HOWEVER THE PICTURE WAS FOUND TO BE SO COATED WITH GRAY DUST THAT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS DISTINGUISHABLE
THAT AFTERNOON THEY ENTERED THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE FOR THE THIRD TIME
CAN WE OPEN THE LOCKET
I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL--ONLY SEVENTEEN
IT'S NO USE SHE GROANED
SUDDENLY SHE GAVE A LITTLE CRY
ISN'T THIS JUST LIKE THE ELIMINATION IN ALGEBRA THAT LEAVES ONLY BROTHER SISTER OR HUSBAND TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU FORGET AUNTS UNCLES AND COUSINS INTERPOSED CYNTHIA
I'M OFF
DON'T FORGET JOYCE THAT YOU ARE COMING OVER TO MY HOUSE TO DINNER AND THIS EVENING WE'LL DO OUR STUDYING SO THAT TO-MORROW WE CAN HAVE THE WHOLE DAY FREE
ANY ONE CAN TELL THAT
AND SO WE WENT INTO THE LOCKED-UP ROOM
BUT WAS SHE IN THE WRONG
BUT I KNEW THAT IF I ONCE ENTERED AND STOOD AMONG HIS DEAR BELONGINGS I SHOULD RELENT I SHOULD RUSH AWAY TO FIND HIM AND BEG HIM TO COME BACK TO ME
YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT THAT'S SOMETHING I SIMPLY CAN'T PUZZLE OUT CONFESSED JOYCE
AND JOYCE WHO HAD WANDERED TO ANOTHER CORNER CAME OVER IN A HURRY
IT'LL RAIN ANY MINUTE NOW I SUPPOSE I KNOW CYNTHIA SYMPATHIZED
BUT I FEEL SURE NEVERTHELESS THAT YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT GOOD
ADDED TO THAT PERFORMING IT BY DIM CANDLE-LIGHT DID NOT LESSEN ITS DIFFICULTIES BUT RATHER INCREASED THEM TENFOLD
DOESN'T EVERYTHING POINT THAT WAY CERTAINLY NOT CYNTHIA SPRAGUE
WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL 16 1861 AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
I HAVEN'T FINISHED YET
OH COME OVER HERE DECIDED JOYCE CHOOSING THE SIDE OPPOSITE THE FIREPLACE
I HARDLY THINK WE COULD
I CAN'T THINK JUST NOW OF ALL OF THEM HE WAS DEEP IN A PREELECTION ARTICLE IN HIS PAPER AND WANTED TO RETURN TO IT
NO ONE EVER TENDED THE GROUNDS
HE'S MADE THE BEST FIND YET IS IT THE KEY CRIED CYNTHIA
I'VE BROUGHT A LOT OVER FOR YOU
JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
THIS BORE SIGNS OF AS MUCH CONFUSION AS THE NEIGHBORING APARTMENT
THE FIRM OF NEW YORK LAWYERS THAT I REMEMBERED HER AS FORMERLY RETAINING I DREADED TO CONSULT LEST THEY THINK I HAD COME TO MAKE A CLAIM ON THE PROPERTY
IF YOU ARE BLESSED WITH A CALM EVEN FORGIVING NATURE THANK GOD FOR IT ALWAYS
OF THIS EXPOSITION IT IS SAFE TO SAY CYNTHIA COMPREHENDED NOT A WORD FOR THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE REASON
WILL YOU NOT COME AND JOIN US
SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN THAT WOULD ENTIRELY PREVENT IT NEXT WEEK
OH WHAT A DREADFUL HOLE WE'VE MADE IN THE WALL-PAPER
VERY WELL
LOOK HERE CYNTHIA WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO EXPLORE IT
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET THROUGH SOMEHOW
IT MUST HAVE BEEN EITHER A SISTER OR BROTHER,--A YOUNGER ONE PROBABLY,--AND THE LOVELY LADY LOVED HER--OR HIM--BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD LOOK HERE INTERRUPTED CYNTHIA SUDDENLY
WHEN EVERY TONGUE OF FLAME WAS SPARKLING SOFTLY THE GIRLS STEPPED BACK TO ADMIRE THE RESULT
BUT THEY WERE THOROUGHLY TIRED AFTER THEIR HEROIC STRUGGLES WITH THE DRAWING-ROOM AND MADE ON THE WHOLE BUT LITTLE PROGRESS
BUT AS THEY COULD NEVER OBTAIN ANY DEFINITE INFORMATION ABOUT IT THEY FINALLY GAVE IT UP AND ACCEPTED THE QUEER OLD PLACE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
HERE'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISCOVERIES YET AND CYNTHIA FOLLOWING HER INDEX-FINGER READ ALOUD
IN THE MIDDLE A LONG DINING-TABLE STOOD UNDER THE CANDELABRUM
SAY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ALL THIS FOR
I SUPPOSE MRS COLLINGWOOD COULD HAVE FORGIVEN HIM MORE EASILY IF HE'D COMMITTED A BURGLARY INSTEAD
THEN JOYCE STEPPED BACK TO LOOK AT THE PLATES AND VASES ON THE MANTEL
LET'S TRY THE ALGEBRA
AND ALL THE WHILE THE SEARCH FOR GOLD WENT ON ENDLESSLY--ENDLESSLY
I STOOD THERE FIVE MINUTES DEBATING IT
AND FATHER SAID I THINK THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING MUCH ABOUT IT ONLY THAT IT WAS A QUEER OLD PLACE AND ONCE HE HAD MET AN ELDERLY LADY WHO HAPPENED TO MENTION TO HIM THAT SHE KNEW THE HOUSE WAS LEFT FURNISHED JUST AS IT WAS AND SHE DIDN'T THINK THE OWNERS WOULD EVER LIVE IN IT AGAIN
I'D HAVE BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN AND TALK IT OVER WITH YOU ONLY YOU WERE SO HATEFUL THAT I JUST WENT HOME INSTEAD AND THOUGHT IT OUT MYSELF WELL I MAY BE STUPID REMARKED CYNTHIA BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LISTEN THEN SAID JOYCE AND I'LL EXPLAIN IT ALL
THEN THEY CLAMBERED OUT
YOU SEE SHE MUST HAVE GONE AROUND CLOSING ALL THE OTHER INSIDE SHUTTERS TIGHT
JOYCE WAS SUDDENLY INSPIRED WITH AN IDEA
EARLY THAT MORNING JOYCE HAD RETURNED FROM THE VISIT TO HER GREAT-AUNT LUCIA AND HAD ENTERED THE CLASS-ROOM LATE
BUT AFTER SOME VIGOROUS PUSHING AND RATTLING IT GAVE WITH AN UNEXPECTED JERK AND THEY WERE LANDED PELL-MELL INTO A DARK HALLWAY
I'VE WASHED THE SWEATER SINCE GOOD IDEA ASSENTED JOYCE
AND IN THE WARM WANING MAY AFTERNOON THEY FILED DOWN THE STEPS
SHE COULDN'T HAVE HELPED SEEING THE LETTER IF SHE HAD COME IN
BUT IT WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD I GUESS IF WE KNEW
SHERLOCK HOLMES WOULD HAVE BUT REMEMBER SUGGESTED CYNTHIA THAT THOSE SHERLOCK HOLMES MYSTERIES WERE USUALLY SOLVED VERY SOON AFTER THE THING HAPPENED
YOU'VE ABSOLUTELY NO IMAGINATION
AND THERE WE FOUND SOMETHING,--OH!--MRS COLLINGWOOD
I'M PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THE OUTSIDE
WHY WAS THAT ROOM UP-STAIRS LOCKED AND WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE KEY MRS COLLINGWOOD FLUSHED
U
U
U
U
I'M STUCK
THERE IS CALLED BACK JOY EXCITEDLY FROM THE DEPTHS
ANNE WAS JUST PUTTING A BIG BATCH OF SUGAR-COOKIES IN THE OVEN AND I SIMPLY HAD TO WAIT TILL THEY WERE DONE
THE MYSTERY OF THE LOCKED ROOM ALWAYS CONFRONTED THEM ALWAYS LURED THEM ON
AND ONE OTHER THING IS CERTAIN TOO
I NEVER WOULD HAVE MURMURED CYNTHIA STILL GAZING AT THE PICTURE OF THE LOVELY LADY
I THINK BY THIS TIME I HAD PRETTY WELL LOST ALL DESIRE EVER TO RETURN TO AMERICA ESPECIALLY TO NEW YORK
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND JOYCE ONLY POINTED TO A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER LYING ON THE BLOTTER
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS
THE TABLE WAS STILL SET WITH DISHES AS THOUGH FOR A FEAST
WE'LL PUT THE CANDLES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM IN THE BIG CANDELABRUM
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
JOYCE GROUPED THE FIVE CANDLES ON THE FLOOR AND THEY SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM FROM TIME TO TIME PULLING OUT FRESH VOLUMES READING ALOUD CLEVER JOKES TO EACH OTHER AND ENJOYING THEMSELVES IMMENSELY UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PASSING MOMENTS
TALLOW ONES WILL DO WHISPERED JOYCE AGHAST AT SUCH EXTRAVAGANCE
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT SO SOON OH I DON'T KNOW--JUST BECAUSE I DO REPLIED CYNTHIA A LITTLE CONFUSED IN MANNER
I'LL ASK MOTHER IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS OLD PLACE NO YOU WON'T CRIED JOYCE COMING SUDDENLY TO EARTH
THAT'S NEARLY A MONTH OFF BEST I CAN DO DUCKIE DEAR
BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THANKS TO GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND
WELL THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY AND THAT'S THE TRAGEDY AND MYSTERY ABOUT THIS BOARDED-UP HOUSE
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA OF VISITING THIS OLD HOME
BUT DAYLIGHT EVEN IF DISMAL WITH RAIN HAD SERVED TO RESTORE THEM COMPLETELY TO THEIR USUAL GAIETY
NEAR THE BED STOOD A PAIR OF DAINTY HIGH-HEELED SATIN SLIPPERS FORGOTTEN THROUGH THE YEARS
BUT REALLY CYNTHIA I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU TO-DAY
CAN ANY FORGIVENESS BE NECESSARY AND SHE CUDDLED THEM BOTH IN HER ARMS
I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
I JUST TOUCHED SOMETHING SOFT ON THE INSTANT JOYCE WAS AT HER SIDE WITH THE CANDLE
I'VE READ THAT SUCH THINGS DID HAPPEN
VERY PRUDENTLY SHE WAITED TILL HER FATHER HAD FINISHED HIS PIPE AND LAID ASIDE HIS PAPER
THEY WILL LIGHT US OUT OF THIS ROOM AND THROUGH THE HALL TO THE CELLAR STAIRS
NEITHER OF THE GIRLS COULD FOR THE MOMENT GUESS WHAT IT WAS THIS QUEER ARRANGEMENT OF WIRES AND TAPE
LET'S HURRY TO LOOK AT THE LAST ONE ON THIS FLOOR
I THINK IT MUST BE A LIBRARY
THE MYSTERY HOWEVER REFUSED TO BE UNRAVELED
THEY CAN'T HURT YOU REPLIED JOYCE UNSYMPATHETICALLY
WELL IN SEVERAL WAYS
H GENERALLY AT THE TABLE AND THEN I STUTTER AND BLUSH AND THEY ALL ASK WHAT'S THE MATTER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD TO ANSWER
AND I HAD TOLD HER ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE'D BEEN TOGETHER SO MANY YEARS AND WHAT WE DID WHEN WE WEREN'T IN SCHOOL
TELL ME--OH PLEASE TELL ME SHE CRIED ARE YOU MRS COLLINGWOOD YES MY DEAR SAID THE LADY
BUT DO YOU KNOW I BELIEVE IF THIS TIME IS A SUCCESS WE MIGHT HAVE IT AGAIN NEXT SATURDAY TOO WELL YOU CAN HAVE IT IF YOU LIKE AND IF YOU CAN RAISE THE MONEY FOR CANDLES LAUGHED CYNTHIA
SUDDENLY SHE BURST OUT
THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN THIS LIFE I FEEL CERTAIN
I WANT TO GET TO THE OTHER END OF THE HALL
THEY NEXT VENTURED DOWN A NARROWER HALL OVER WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE KITCHEN WING
THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW
THAT WAS VERY LOVELY OF YOU,--AND VERY THOUGHTFUL
WHAT CAN BE HIDDEN THERE
WHY THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
I AM TAKING MY MOTHER BACK TO NEW YORK FOR A FEW DAYS
BOTH GIRLS GASPED AND STARED INCREDULOUSLY THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE BY AUGUSTA HUIELL SEAMAN AUTHOR OF JACQUELINE OF THE CARRIER PIGEONS ETC
THE YEARS DRIFTED ON AND WITH THEM CAME OLD AGE AND THE RELUCTANCE TO MAKE THE LONG JOURNEY AND ENDURE THE STRAIN OF IT ALL
SHE EMERGED WITH A FLUSHED FACE AND A TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE
THAT'S A SMALL DOOR WITHOUT A DOUBT,--PERHAPS TO SOME UNUSED CLOSET
THAT POOR LOVING PROUD MOTHER AND HER TERRIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING WITH HER SPLENDID SON HE WAS RIGHT TOO I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
IT SEEMED SO HOPELESS
LET US FORGET ALL THAT NOW
NOW THAT YOU'VE DISCOVERED HIS BUNK I HOPE YOU'RE COMING BACK TO THE VERANDA
SHE INDEED HAD EVEN STRONGER FEELINGS THAN JOYCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR TRESPASSING BUT THE JOY OF THE ADVENTURE AND THE MYSTERY WITH WHICH THEY WERE SURROUNDING IT OUTWEIGHED HER SCRUPLES
HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM
IT CAN BE DONE FROM THE OUTSIDE I THINK SHE WAS FOOLISH TO LEAVE ALL HER GOOD CLOTHES COMMENTED CYNTHIA AND THE LOCKET UNDER THE BED TOO I DON'T BELIEVE SHE REMEMBERED THE LOCKET--OR CARED ABOUT IT MUSED JOYCE
WHEN THEY WERE ALONE THE TWO GIRLS STOOD STARING AT ONE ANOTHER AND CYNTHIA'S CHEEKS GREW FIERY RED
WHAT'S A THEORY WHY YOU KNOW
BUT ONE THING I CAN GUESS PRETTY PLAINLY--THEY WENT RIGHT AFTER THE DINNER-PARTY AND DIDN'T STAY OVER ANOTHER NIGHT
THEN SHE REPLIED
NO FOR SOME REASON WE CAN'T GUESS SHE LOCKED THE DOOR,--AND NEVER KNEW AND SHE NEVER NEVER WILL KNOW WHISPERED CYNTHIA
SUPPOSE WE MAKE IT THE WEEK-END BEFORE ELECTION
AT LEAST I THINK THIS MAY BE AN EXPLANATION
THAT WOULD BE A SENSIBLE THING TO DO NOW WOULDN'T IT
HE LOOKED IT
NEVER WAS A CHANGE MORE REMARKABLE THAN THAT WHICH HAD COME UPON MRS COLLINGWOOD
LET'S FINISH LOOKING AROUND HERE AND LEAVE THE REST FOR ANOTHER DAY THEY BEGAN ACCORDINGLY TO WALK SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM PEERING UP AT THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS AND PICKING THEIR WAY WITH CARE AROUND THE FURNITURE WITHOUT MOVING OR TOUCHING ANYTHING
PERHAPS THEY THINK CR-R-R-RACK SOMETHING GAVE WITH A LONG RESOUNDING NOISE AND THE TWO GIRLS CLASPED EACH OTHER IN AN AGONY OF TERROR
A FEW BOOKS WERE STREWN ABOUT AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT AND THROWN DOWN HASTILY BUT THAT WAS ALL
LET'S TRY SHE PICKED IT UP AND PRIED AT THE CATCH WITH HER THUMB-NAIL
WHEN PEOPLE DIE YOU'RE TERRIBLY GRIEVED AND UPSET OF COURSE AND YOU MAY SHUT UP YOUR HOUSE AND NEVER COME NEAR IT AGAIN
THEN SHE BEGAN TO PACK UP TO GO AWAY AND DECIDED SHE WOULDN'T BOTHER TAKING MOST OF HER THINGS
HERE WAS NOTHING SO VERY STRANGE AFTER ALL
AND THEN SOMEHOW I SORT OF LIKE TO KEEP THE MYSTERY ABOUT THAT PICTURE TILL A LITTLE LATER,--TILL WE'VE SEEN THE REST OF THE HOUSE AND BEGUN PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER WOULDN'T YOU CYNTHIA AGREED AS SHE WAS USUALLY LIKELY TO DO AND JOYCE ADDED
JOYCE THIS IS HORRID GASPED CYNTHIA
OH MY DEAR YOU HAVE LOST SOME ONE
IT WAS A CURIOUS INTERMITTENT IRREGULAR SOUND AS OF SOMETHING BEING PUSHED ABOUT THE FLOOR
I'M GOING TO BED CHAPTER XIII THE GREAT ILLUMINATION THE NEXT MORNING THE TWO GIRLS MET AS THOUGH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING UNPLEASANT HAD HAPPENED
THERE'S A REAL-ESTATE AGENT OVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOWN--MR WADE--AND HE OUGHT TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL THE PROPERTY HERE
IN FACT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
AFTER THEY HAD LISTENED A MOMENT IT SUDDENLY STRUCK THEM BOTH THAT THE NOISE WAS SOMEHOW VERY FAMILIAR
NO I DON'T THINK IT WAS HER HUSBAND OR THAT SHE WAS MARRIED AT ALL
THAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE
I SAID SHE PROBABLY FAINTED YES YOU WERE RIGHT
GOOD GRACIOUS CYNTHIA
JOYCE WAS READING IT--OR PRETENDING TO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF ME JOYCE SHE STAMMERED
HE STARED AT THEM IN SOME SURPRISE AS THEY ENTERED
WHAT A STRANGE NAME
THERE'S JUST ONE THING THAT SEEMS TO ME THOROUGHLY FOOLISH CYNTHIA CONTINUED
THE OLDER PEOPLE LISTENED INTENTLY SOMETIMES AMUSED SOMETIMES TOUCHED OFTEN MORE DEEPLY MOVED THAN THEY CARED TO SHOW
WE'VE GOT TO GO AT ONCE THEN
MOTHER AND FATHER HAD GONE OUT TO CALL ON SOME FRIENDS BUT IT WAS RAINING AND I HAD A SORE THROAT SO THEY DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ME
IT WAS THE IDENTICAL DRESS BEYOND QUESTION
I'LL TELL YOU ALL THAT HE INTERRUPTED IF YOU'LL TELL ME WHO JOYCE KENWAY IS WHY I AM SAID JOYCE IN SURPRISE
LIFE APPEARED A TRIFLE DRAB AS IT USUALLY DOES WHEN CHERISHED PLANS ARE DEMOLISHED AND THE SUN GOES IN
OTHERWISE THE INCLOSURE WAS CLEAR EXCEPT FOR A FEW OLD FARM IMPLEMENTS IN A DISTANT CORNER
I'VE BEEN SAVING IT UP EVER SO LONG--NOT FOR THAT SPECIALLY--BUT I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO USE IT FOR THAT WELL YOU ARE THE QUEEREST ONE EXCLAIMED JOYCE
AND THAT'S AS PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF'--A KEYHOLE CYNTHIA NODDED
LOOK THEY'RE ALL ALIKE WITH RED BACKS AND MOTTLED SIDES SHE OPENED ONE CURIOUSLY
LOOK CYNTHIA CYNTHIA STILL STUDYING THE TILES STRAIGHTENED UP TO LOOK WHERE HER COMPANION HAD POINTED
THE CLASS FEVERISHLY COPIED MORE CRYPTIC SYMBOLS IN ITS NOTEBOOKS
JOYCE KENWAY
JOYCE KENWAY
I WAS IN FACT PRACTICALLY PENNILESS
THIS IS A PREDICAMENT EXCLAIMED FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD WHO WAS FIRST TO RECOVER FROM THE SURPRISE
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW WHO PUT THEM THERE HURRY SHE CLUTCHED AT CYNTHIA EXPECTING INSTANT ACQUIESCENCE
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON LEFT--HIS MOTHER YOU'VE STRUCK IT AT LAST
BUT WHY--WHY SAID JOYCE SPEAKING HER THOUGHT ALOUD WAS IT ALL LEFT JUST LIKE THIS
WILL YOU NOT GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF IT NOW
YOU SEE WE KNEW ALL THE REST OF THE--THE STORY FROM JOYCE'S GREAT-AUNT LUCIA KENWAY
OF COURSE YOU HAVE ONE YES I HAVE ONE AND I HAVE LAIN AWAKE NIGHTS TOO THINKING IT OUT
IT HAD NOT SEEMED VERY INTERESTING THEN AND AS HE HAD SAID SHE DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE CYNTHIA EVEN FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
OH NOTHING MUCH
MOST PEOPLE DO DON'T THEY
THERE'S THE EASIEST WAY TO DECIDE ALL THIS WHAT IS IT CRIED JOYCE OPENING HER EYES WIDE
WAIT WELL WHERE AND WHEN THEN CRIED CYNTHIA
YOU DEAR LITTLE MEDDLERS SHE EXCLAIMED
THEY WERE PLUMP PLACID BABIES AGED PROBABLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEY APPEARED PRECISELY ALIKE
TUESDAY APRIL 16 1861 WHICH PROVES ADDED JOYCE THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED HERE DIDN'T TAKE PLACE MUCH EARLIER THAN THIS DATE OR THE PAPER WOULDN'T BE HERE
NEITHER OF THEM HAD YET SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED FROM HER AMAZEMENT TO BE QUITE COHERENT
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE FAIR
YOU'RE NOT IN A STUDYING FRAME OF MIND JOYCE--CERTAINLY NOT FOR GEOMETRY
AND THEY ALL LEFT IN A HURRY TOO JUDGING FROM THE WAY THINGS ARE STREWN ABOUT
THE MOMENT WAS AN AWKWARD ONE AND CYNTHIA WISHED MADLY THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN PROMPTED TO ASK THAT UNFORTUNATE QUESTION
PERHAPS ONE WILL FIT THIS THEY HUNTED UP SEVERAL AND WORKED WITH THEM ALL BUT NOT ONE MADE THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION ON THIS OBSTINATE LOCK
HE CAME BACK IN DUE TIME BUT BRINGING NOTHING FOR ME AND I FELT THAT MY APPEAL HAD BEEN IN VAIN
I DON'T SEE WHY THAT YOUNG FAIRFAX SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED SO
UNKEMPT BUSHES AND TALL RANK GRASS FLOURISHED IN THIS INCLOSURE AND NEAR THE PORCH GREW TWO PINE-TREES LIKE SENTINELS AT THE ENTRANCE
THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO-DAY ON--ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST
SHE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL JUST A TRIFLE SORRY THAT SHE HAD BEEN SO SHORT WITH HER BELOVED FRIEND
UNWASHED DISHES AND COOKING UTENSILS LAY ALL ABOUT HELTER-SKELTER SOME EVEN BROKEN IN THE HURRY WITH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN HANDLED
DON'T YOU SEE HOW GOLIATH GOT IN
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THE FEAST SOMETHING HAPPENED,--I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT,--BUT IT BROKE UP THE GOOD TIME RIGHT AWAY
BUT WAIT TILL I FINISH SWEEPING OUT UNDER HERE
IT'S AN UNUSUAL ONE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM POSSIBLE THAT MORE THAN ONE PERSON COULD HAVE IT THOUGH OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE A DISTANT CONNECTION OF THE SAME FAMILY
THEY ALL DREW LONG BREATHS OF RELAXED TENSION
AND NOTHING I EVER KNEW OF HAS MADE ME FEEL AS THIS HOUSE HAS
THESE BIG VOLUMES LOOK SO INTERESTING SHE BRUSHED THE THICK DUST OFF THEIR BACKS REVEALING THE TITLES
THIS IS ALL SO ASTONISHING TO ME
BUT WHEN CYNTHIA REACHED THE TALE OF THE HIDDEN STAIRWAY SHE STARTED IN SURPRISE
IF YOU DON'T COME SOON I'M GOING ON
AND THEN HER HAIR NOT HIGH AND POWDERED AND ALL FUSSED UP BUT LOW AND PARTED SMOOTH AND DRAWN DOWN OVER HER EARS AND THAT DEAR LITTLE WREATH OF TINY ROSES
THERE WAS COMPLETE SILENCE
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE MUMBLED CROSSLY
HIS EYES ARE THE SAME BUT,--WELL I SOMEHOW NEVER COUNTED ON THE CHANGE THAT ALL THOSE FORTY YEARS WOULD MAKE
NEVER MIND WHAT THEY THINK JUST FOR TO-NIGHT RESPONDED MRS COLLINGWOOD GAILY
I'M DOWN PRETTY LOW ON MY ALLOWANCE BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT'S GOT TO DO WITH THINGS JOYCE LAUGHED
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PUT YOUR MIND ON IT I'LL TRY GRINNED JOYCE IN FEIGNED CONTRITION
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE EITHER A SECRET CUPBOARD OR ROOM CYNTHIA SEIZED A CANDLE AND HURRIED AWAY COMING BACK BREATHLESS WITH THE RUSTY TOOL
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SOFT BALMY APRIL DAY AND SPRING SEEMED WELL BEGUN
BOTH GIRLS WERE NOW NUMB WITH TERROR
CHAPTER V JOYCE MAKES A NEW DISCOVERY
I REMEMBER WHERE IT IS NOW
HE'D COME BACK AFTER A WHILE AND DO WHAT HE PLEASED WITH IT
BUT JOYCE WENT OVER AND PICKED IT UP WHEN IT FELL INTO SHAPE AS SHE HELD IT AT ARM'S-LENGTH
THAT TOO SEEMED INCREDIBLE AS I REMEMBERED NO SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
FOR ONE THING BECAUSE IT WAS ALL CLOSED UP AND PAPERED OVER
IT IS SIX-THIRTY
WE WILL FIND SOMETHING INTERESTING THERE I'LL WARRANT WITH GOLIATH SCAMPERING AHEAD THEY CLIMBED THE WHITE MAHOGANY-RAILED STAIRCASE
NOW TELL ME SHE SAID TO CYNTHIA
YOU JUST SPOKE OF DETECTIVES AND THAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD
I'LL MAKE THE GREATEST EFFORT
WELL I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAY A THING LIKE THAT CYNTHIA DEMANDED AT ONCE
LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS THEY TIPTOED OVER AND RAISED THE VALANCE
ER--I SEE
I HAVE LOST MY SON
ANYHOW WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO PRY INTO ANYTHING WE OUGHT NOT TOUCH
AND NOT A BABY EITHER BUT A FINE HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW OF SEVENTEEN
COULDN'T WE WAIT A FEW MOMENTS TILL SOME AIR GETS IN IMPLORED CYNTHIA IN A MUFFLED VOICE
HE SEEMED TO PREFER THIS COMFORTABLE SPOT TO ALL OTHERS BUT HE ROSE AND STRETCHED WHEN THE GIRLS CAME IN
TEN YEARS SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE DROPPED FROM HER SHOULDERS
HAVE NO HESITATION IN ASKING WHAT YOU WISH IT'S THIS THEN
CRAWL AROUND THE END OF THE BUSHES CYN
JOYCE KENWAY YOU ARE--_ABOMINABLE
IT BEATS A CHRISTMAS-TREE ALL HOLLOW
PRODUCED BY ANNIE MCGUIRE ILLUSTRATION
I COULD HAVE DONE SO NO MORE ACCEPTABLY THAN IN THE VERY COURSE I WAS NOW PURSUING
BUT CYNTHIA WAS EQUAL TO THIS EMERGENCY
THERE WAS MORE HERE THAN EVEN JOYCE HAD HOPED OR IMAGINED
WELL YOU ARE THE QUEEREST CHILD
BUT HER BRAIN WAS IN A WHIRL AND SHE COULD NOT CONCENTRATE HER THOUGHTS ON HER WORK
SOME ONE PULLED THAT CHAIR CLOSE TO THE MANTEL STEPPED ON IT AND TURNED THE PICTURE FACE TO THE WALL
JOYCE I WISH YOU WOULD NOT SAY THAT INTERRUPTED CYNTHIA SHARPLY
WHAT SHALL WE DO BREATHED CYNTHIA
FORTUNATELY I HAVE A BOX OF MATCHES ILLUSTRATION
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LONGED FOR
A FRATERNITY MEETING HAD OCCUPIED ONE AFTERNOON DANCING-SCHOOL ANOTHER A TRAMPING-EXCURSION A THIRD AND SO ON THROUGH THE ENSUING WEEK
FIVE MINUTES WORK WILL CLEAR THIS WINDOW AND THEN BUT GOOD GRACIOUS JOY YOU WOULDN'T BREAK IN A WINDOW OF A STRANGE HOUSE AND CLIMB IN THE CELLAR LIKE A BURGLAR CRIED CYNTHIA GENUINELY SHOCKED
MY BUT THAT MAN WAS CRANKY WASN'T HE I THINK HE WAS SICK SAID CYNTHIA
DO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S QUARTER-PAST SIX SHE ASKED QUIETLY
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING A BIGGER ONE COULDN'T FIND ANY OTHER SAID JOYCE
BUT DID YOUR GREAT-AUNT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE PICTURES NO BUT I ASKED HER IF MRS COLLINGWOOD HAD ANY OTHER CHILDREN AND SHE SAID SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT FAIRFAX HAD BEEN A TWIN BUT HIS LITTLE SISTER HAD DIED WHEN SHE WASN'T MUCH MORE THAN THREE YEARS OLD
HOME SAID JOYCE
THE MYSTERY OF THE LOCKED-UP ROOM REPLIED CYNTHIA
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A FLASH OF GRAY ACROSS THE LAWN CLOSELY PURSUED BY A STREAK OF YELLOW
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT CANDLE-LIGHT WAS THE LOVELIEST OF ALL ARTIFICIAL ILLUMINATION AND NOW I BELIEVE IT
MRS DURAND NEVER SAW HER AGAIN EITHER BUT USED TO HEAR FROM HER AT VERY LONG INTERVALS
BUT THERE WERE SOME WHO KEPT ON HAVING CANDLES BECAUSE THEY PREFERRED THAT KIND OF LIGHT--ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRY-HOUSES
I NEVER SUPPOSED IT WAS A GIRL WHO SENT ME THAT NOTE
JOYCE COME HERE SHE CALLED IN A VOICE OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
THEN SHE MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT WISHING JOY WOULD HURRY FOR IT'S GOING TO RAIN THEN SHE DUG HER HANDS INTO HER SWEATER POCKETS AND STARED ACROSS THE LAWN AT A BLUE HYDRANGEA BUSH WITH A SINGLE REMAINING BUNCH OF BLOSSOMS HANGING HEAVY ON ITS STEM
WE FELT SURE YOU HAD NEVER SEEN IT AND THAT YOU OUGHT TO
MY GUIDE WAS NOT HONEST,--INDEED FEW OF THEM ARE,--BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH I NEVER DISCOVERED ANY DISHONESTY IN HIM WHILE HE WAS WITH ME
AND CYNTHIA ALL EXCITEMENT RUSHED DOWN CELLAR TO FIND IT
WHY LOOK AT THE CANDLES SHE CRIED
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
I'M AFRAID WE AREN'T VERY GOOD DETECTIVES OR WE'D HAVE DONE IT LONG BEFORE THIS
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A THIRD OF IT YET,--NO NOT EVEN A QUARTER
YOU SEE THAT ARTICLE SAID HE HADN'T BEEN EAST HERE FOR FORTY YEARS
WHY CERTAINLY
MY SWEATER WAS JUST BLACK WITH DIRT AND COBWEBS LAST TIME AND MOTHER ALMOST INSISTED ON AN EXPLANATION
I CAN'T TELL
LITTLE HALF-CHARRED SCRAPS WITH FAINT WRITING STILL LAY SCATTERED ON THE HEARTH
NOW COMMANDED JOYCE STEPPING ON THE SEAT OF ONE WHILE CYNTHIA MOUNTED THE OTHER BE AWFULLY CAREFUL
BUT HASN'T IT STRUCK YOU THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE CANDLES_--PLENTY OF THEM--AND MATCHES AND A COUPLE OF CANDLESTICKS AT LEAST
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT HAS PUZZLED ME ALL ALONG BEGAN JOYCE AT LAST
NOW LET'S TRY TO WORK THAT OUT
IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE IN EXISTENCE
WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO GO IN THERE BY THE CELLAR WINDOW AGAIN SHE REMARKED
BUT SHE NEVER TOUCHED THEM IN THIS ROOM
COULDN'T WE GO SOONER
THE STONES OF THE WALL ARE LIKE REGULAR STEPS YOU CAN PUT YOUR FEET ON EM OH BUT THE MICE AND THE SPIDERS AND--AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS GROANED CYNTHIA
BUT AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF FRUITLESS SEARCH AND FRUITLESS TOIL I STOOD AS POOR AS THE DAY I HAD FIRST COME INTO THE REGION
FOR ONE LONG INTENSE MOMENT THEY STARED AT IT
A GENEROUS STAIRWAY OF WHITE-PAINTED WOOD WITH SLENDER MAHOGANY RAILING ASCENDED TO AN UPPER FLOOR
IN CONAN DOYLE'S MYSTERY STORIES SHERLOCK HOLMES ALWAYS HAS A THEORY ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE HE REALLY KNOWS
NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES AND THEY FELL TO WORK WITH WHISK-BROOM AND DUST-CLOTHS
ISN'T IT LUCKY WE JUST HAPPENED TO TAKE THE BOOKS OUT THAT WERE IN FRONT OF IT BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT QUESTIONED CYNTHIA
IT'S ALL RIGHT REALLY OF COURSE
NOW DECLARED JOYCE THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING INTERESTING I HOPE CYNTHIA SAID NOTHING HAVING INDEED MUCH ADO TO APPEAR CALM AND HOLD HERSELF FROM MAKING A SUDDEN BOLT BACK TO THE CELLAR WINDOW
MOMSIE POSITIVELY FORBADE IT
I WAITED THREE MONTHS MORE IN GREAT IMPATIENCE THEN SENT HIM BACK TO THE SAME POST TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE A REPLY
WHO BUT YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING I DON'T SEE ANYTHING QUEER ABOUT IT RETORTED CYNTHIA
YOU GREAT BIG STUPID_!--WHY WE'VE DISCOVERED THE WAY TO THE LOCKED-UP ROOM THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER CYNTHIA LOOKED INCREDULOUS
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA IS VERY OLD AND VERY FEEBLE
WE COULD TURN IT BACK AFTER WE'D SEEN IT COULDN'T WE JOYCE THOUGHT IT OVER A MOMENT
THEN SOMEBODY WANTED TO MAKE IT INTO A LIBRARY AND FILL ALL THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM WITH BOOK-SHELVES
THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO GLASS WINDOW-FRAME BEHIND IT
I SHA'N'T WAIT A MOMENT BUT YOU MAY IF YOU WISH CALLED BACK JOYCE
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS A DETECTIVE
THE ONE THING THAT ATTRACTED MOST STRONGLY WAS THE PORTRAIT OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN--SHE SEEMED SCARCELY MORE THAN A GIRL--OVER THE FIREPLACE
I'VE GONE SO FAR NOW THAT I BELIEVE I'D BE WILLING TO BREAK THINGS OPEN WITH A CHARGE OF DYNAMITE IF WE COULDN'T GET IN ANY OTHER WAY
I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE STRANGE STORY I HAVE TO TELL
CYNTHIA SHE SAID IN A TENSE WHISPER DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE NO DECLARED CYNTHIA HONESTLY IT NEVER DID
WHAT IS IT LOOK IN THERE JOYCE SNATCHED A CANDLE AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE OPENING MADE BY THE BOOKS
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW AND IT'S THE ONLY DAMAGE WE'VE DONE THEY COMMENCED TO TIPTOE ABOUT THE ROOM GLANCING CURIOUSLY AT ITS CONTENTS
THEY WOULD EITHER CARRY IT AWAY WITH THEM OR LAY IT DOWN FORGOTTEN OR HIDE IT IN SOME UNUSUAL PLACE
ARE THEY LIKE THE ONES IN THE REST OF THE HOUSE OH NO CRIED CYNTHIA
I WAS A SOUTHERNER BUT MY HUSBAND CAME FROM THE NORTH AND BROUGHT ME UP NORTH HERE TO LIVE
READY THEY REACHED OUT AND GRASPED THE HEAVY FRAME
THE CHINA AND GLASSWARE STOOD JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN LEFT THOUGH EVERY ANCIENT VESTIGE OF FOOD HAD LONG SINCE BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY THE MICE
CYNTHIA JUMPED UP AND WAVED MADLY
HERE IT IS SHE BREATHED
AND THE WAY LED ME FARTHER AND FARTHER FROM THE HAUNTS OF MEN
THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS--THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT
WHO KNOWS BUT WHAT THE KEY MAY HAVE BEEN THROWN IN TOO SHE BEGAN TO RAKE THE DEAD ASHES AND SUDDENLY A HALF-BURNED LOG FELL APART DROPPING SOMETHING THROUGH TO THE BOTTOM WITH A CHINKING SOUND
SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN
OF COURSE MRS DURAND TOOK HER RIGHT IN AND THAT NIGHT MRS COLLINGWOOD TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
ONLY IT WILL BE A HEAVY THING TO LIFT
IT'S A COLONIAL MANSION TOO AND STOOD HERE BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
WE'LL EAT THESE WHEN WE'RE INSIDE
SHE BEGAN TELLING ME THAT IT WAS SO STRANGE,--THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THIS HOUSE ONCE AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH JUST BEFORE IT WAS CLOSED FOR GOOD
LET'S BUY THE CANDLES RIGHT OFF
AND HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN BEFORE WE CAME
BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
JOYCE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS WITH A DISGUSTED MOVEMENT
TOO BAD SHE BEGAN
CHAPTER XI THE ROOM THAT WAS LOCKED BEFORE CYNTHIA COULD REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED OR WAS HAPPENING JOYCE SEIZED HER AND BEGAN WALTZING MADLY AROUND THE LIBRARY ALTERNATELY LAUGHING SOBBING HUGGING AND SHAKING HER DISTRACTEDLY
LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE EVER SEPARATED THEM SAVE THE WALLS OF THEIR OWN DWELLINGS--AND THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
OH IT'S GORGEOUS
AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE THERE NEVER WAS A SWEETHEART LIKE THIS MOTHER FAIR OF MINE HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MRS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
HER FACE FROM BEING ONE OF THE SADDEST THEY HAD EVER SEEN HAD GROWN FAIRLY RADIANT
WHATEVER IT WAS THE FIRE HAS PRETTY WELL FINISHED IT
HE LED THE WAY THAT FIRST DAY IF YOU REMEMBER
THAT'S DIFFERENT TOO
HANDLE THERE WAS NONE IT HAVING DOUBTLESS BEEN REMOVED WHEN THE PLACE WAS PAPERED
IT'S JUST LIKE A STORY JOYCE WOULD EXCLAIM
A FARMER SOLD 300 ACRES WHEN JOYCE SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED
THEY WERE READING ALOUD THE SIGN OF FOUR THEY INCLINED MUCH TOWARD MYSTERY AND DETECTIVE STORIES AT THIS TIME TURN AND TURN ABOUT WHILE THE ONE WHO NOT HAVE THE BOOK SEWED OR EMBROIDERED
THERE'S ONE THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT IT THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS SAID JOYCE THOUGHTFULLY
I SCARCELY NEED TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT RETURNING TO AUSTRALIA WE SHALL COME BACK HERE VERY SOON OPEN UP THIS OLD HOME PUT IT IN ORDER AND PROBABLY SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES BETWEEN HERE AND THE SOUTH
YOU WONDERFUL TWO HE EXCLAIMED
HUSH
HUSH
I AM SO SURE I AM RIGHT AND I HAVE PLEDGED MY WORD
WELL YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE THAT I NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF MY SKIN AT THE NAME--FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD
THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM WERE LINED WITH BOOK-SHELVES REACHING NEARLY TO THE CEILING
AFTER HE HAD GONE THAT NIGHT SHE COLLECTED ALL HER SILVER AND HID IT AND PARTIALLY PACKED HER OWN THINGS AND THEN DECIDED SHE WOULDN'T TAKE THEM WITH HER
THE LOCKET FELL OPEN AND REVEALED ITSELF--EMPTY
IN THE MEANTIME THE FASCINATION OF THE LIFE HAD TAKEN HOLD OF ME AND I COULD RELINQUISH IT FOR NO OTHER
VERY WELL SIGHED CYNTHIA IN SLOW ASSENT
I WONDER THOUGH IF PEOPLE COULD SEE THE LIGHT FROM THE STREET THROUGH ANY CHINKS IN THE BOARDING OF COURSE NOT SAID JOYCE
I OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE DONE THIS I SUPPOSE WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME DEMANDED JOYCE
BUT THE ROOM HAD FURTHER DETAILS TO BE EXAMINED
SOMETHING CLINKED
VERY WELL THEN I'LL HAVE TO GET THEM FROM MINE I SUPPOSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I HAD HEARD OF THE EXCEEDING BITTERNESS OF THE SOUTH INCREASED TENFOLD BY THE PERIOD OF RECONSTRUCTION THROUGH WHICH IT WAS THEN PASSING
AND BESIDES SHE'D NEVER TALKED TO HIM MUCH ABOUT THE SOUTHERN CAUSE SO HE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW SHE FELT
SHE JUST SAID
AND MORE THAN THAT WE COULDN'T GET IN IF WE TRIED
MASSES OF SOFT WAVY WHITE HAIR FRAMED A FACE OF SINGULAR CHARM DESPITE ITS AGE AND THE BIGGEST SADDEST BROWN EYES IN ALL THE WORLD LOOKED OUT INQUIRINGLY ON THE TWO GIRLS
IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST
NOW HAVE YOU ANY ABOUT WHAT RELATIVE IT WAS
TO SAY THAT I WAS COMPLETELY BEWILDERED BY IT WOULD BE PUTTING IT MILDLY
TWO TRUNKS STOOD ON THE FLOOR OPEN AND PARTIALLY PACKED
MICE HAD DOUBTLESS CARRIED OFF EVERY VESTIGE OF SUCH LONG SINCE A GREAT WARDROBE STOOD IN ONE CORNER THE OPEN DOORS OF WHICH REVEALED SOME GARMENTS STILL HANGING ON THE PEGS WOOLEN DRESSES MOSTLY REDUCED NOW TO LITTLE MORE THAN RAGS THROUGH THE RAVAGES OF MOTHS AND MICE AND TIME
JOYCE STRUGGLED THROUGH THEM TEARING THE POCKET OF HER SWEATER AND PULLING HER HAIR AWRY
MY BUSINESS WOULD NOT KEEP ME IN NEW YORK MORE THAN A WEEK AND I INTENDED TO TRAVEL AT ONCE BACK TO AUSTRALIA ACROSS THE CONTINENT IN ORDER TO SEE THE CHANGES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE I LEFT
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO-DAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE I DON'T KNOW
THE DESK IS RIGHT BY THE WINDOW
NOT ONCE HOWEVER IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE OUTSIDE INTERESTS HAD THEY FORGOTTEN THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURE
BUT--WHAT
WE'LL TAKE THESE TO USE FOR OUR CANDLES
CYNTHIA HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GUESSING THE MEANING OF THE INITIALS BUT SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT POCKET-MONEY HAD TO DO WITH THE MATTER SO SHE WROTE BACK
THE TWO GIRLS WERE SITTING ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STAIRCASE IN THE DARK HALLWAY
YES SHE MUST HAVE DONE IT CYNTHIA
WHEN THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER THEY TALKED OF IT INCESSANTLY AND LAID ELABORATE PLANS FOR FUTURE AMATEUR DETECTIVE WORK
EACH ROOM PRESENTED A TUMBLED UNKEMPT APPEARANCE
AND THEN TOO OUR FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD WAS DEAD
HER BROWN EYES FLASHED WITH SOMETHING OF THEIR FORMER FIRE AND SHE SMILED DOWN AT THEM AS ONLY THE LOVELY LADY OF THE PORTRAIT HAD EVER SMILED
WE NEVER SAW THOSE PICTURES PROPERLY BEFORE NOW IT LOOKS AS IT DID FIFTY YEARS AGO SAID CYNTHIA SOFTLY
CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I GOLIATH LEADS THE WAY 3 II IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE 22 III AMATEUR DETECTIVES 33 IV THE ROOM OF MYSTERY 46 V JOYCE MAKES A NEW DISCOVERY
NOW FOR IT MUTTERED JOYCE
CERTAINLY THE TIME FOR IT WAS RIPE AND BEYOND A DOUBT THEY FELT THEM
THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE ON THIS OCCASION A NUMBER OF HIGH-FLOWN AND APPROPRIATE REMARKS THE TENOR OF WHICH WOULD BE EASY TO IMAGINE
I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE A ROOM HOWEVER BEYOND THE DINING-ROOM WAS AWAITING THEIR INSPECTION
ONE WOULD THINK I'D BEEN DOING SOMETHING WRONG THE WAY YOU SPEAK OH I DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY EXPLAINED CYNTHIA CONTRITELY
WELL I WENT INTO THE HEART OF AUSTRALIA UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS NOW REALLY MOTHERLESS AND UNDER THAT IMPRESSION I HAVE LIVED EVER SINCE
IT MUST BE VERY VALUABLE CYNTHIA BENT DOWN AND EXAMINED BOTH ARTICLES CLOSELY
THEY DID THOSE THINGS AT THAT TIME
SHE ALMOST SEEMS TO BE GOING TO SPEAK
COPYRIGHT 1915 BY THE CENTURY CO
JOYCE DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE ANY HARM IN MY DOING SOMETHING I'VE LONGED TO DO EVER SINCE WE FIRST ENTERED THIS HOUSE WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT QUERIED JOYCE
AND THEN THERE'S ONE THING MORE
THE LADY TURNED TO HER
HERE TOO WAS ANOTHER ELABORATE CANDELABRUM SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN THE FIRST QUEER SPINDLE-LEGGED FIDDLE-BACKED CHAIRS BEAUTIFUL CABINETS AND TABLES AND AN OLD SQUARE PIANO STILL OPEN
YOU HAD THE RIGHT NOTION THAT TIME
I THINK I POSTED IT A WEEK AGO THURSDAY AND YOU KNEW ALL THE TIME LAST NIGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO-DAY ASKED JOYCE INCREDULOUSLY
BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME--IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BEFORE SHE CAME HERE AND YOU KNOW SHE ONLY LIVED IN THIS HOUSE EIGHTEEN YEARS
PROBABLY WE LEFT IT SO IN OUR HURRY THE OTHER DAY
IT'S ALL RIGHT
BUT CAN'T YOU THINK OF JUST A FEW SHE IMPLORED
BUT IF IT HAD BEEN THOUGHTLESSLY LAID ASIDE SOMEWHERE OR EVEN HIDDEN AWAY IN SOME OBSCURE CORNER THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT COME UPON IT
SO OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE FELT THE SHOCK OF WHAT HER SON DID TERRIBLY
MY MOTHER AS I SUPPOSED WAS DEAD
ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS FAR AT THE BACK SAT GOLIATH CURLED INTO A COMFORTABLE BALL HIS FRONT PAWS TUCKED UNDER AND PURRING LOUDLY
THEN THEY SCURRIED UP-STAIRS ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM AND SET THEIR CANDLESTICKS ON THE TABLE
LET'S GO BACK IT'S LOVELY CHUCKLED JOYCE
CHAPTER X AN EXCITING DISCOVERY THE AUTUMN OF THAT YEAR ENDED THE WINTER MONTHS CAME AND WENT WITH ALL THEIR HOLIDAY FESTIVITIES AND SPRING ENTERED IN HER APPOINTED TIME
BUT IF IT WERE SO I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHY HE DIDN'T GO AND MAKE IT UP WITH HIS MOTHER AFTERWARD
I CAN'T SEEM TO SEE ANYTHING SO DIFFERENT
SHE HAD THE BOARDING ALL IN THE CELLAR FOR IT HAD BEEN MADE TWO YEARS BEFORE WHEN SHE WENT TO EUROPE FOR SIX MONTHS
SO FAR FROM THE HAUNTS OF HUMANITY AND THE CLASH OF HUMAN INTERESTS ONE CANNOT HELP BUT LOOK AT ALL THINGS MORE SANELY
WELL BREATHED CYNTHIA AT LENGTH
SHE BEGAN AT LENGTH TO WRIGGLE ABOUT GOT UP TWICE AND WALKED AROUND RESTLESSLY AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN
OH I WISH I COULD VISIT HER EXCLAIMED JOYCE
MY WOUND DISQUALIFIED ME FROM FURTHER ARMY SERVICE AND GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE EVEN AFTER I WAS DISMISSED FROM THE HOSPITAL
IT'S QUEER WE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
CHAPTER II IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE THEY STUMBLED UP THE CELLAR STEPS THEIR EYES GROWING GRADUALLY USED TO THE SEMI-DARKNESS
SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK THE KEY AWAY OR DID SOMETHING WITH IT,--THOUGH WHAT ON EARTH FOR I CAN'T IMAGINE BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE DID IT BEFORE SHE READ THE NOTE DEMANDED CYNTHIA
HOW ELSE CAN WE EVER GET ABOUT THE PLACE PITCH-DARK AS IT ALL IS
SHE WAS SO SWEET AND GRACIOUS AND CHARMINGLY PRETTY
OF COURSE NOT
BUT CYNTHIA WAS OBDURATE
WE OUGHT TO CHANGE YOUR NAME TO SHERLOCK HOLMES CHAPTER VIII CYNTHIA HAS AN IDEA IT'S NO USE CYNTHIA
CYNTHIA COME HERE CYNTHIA WHO HAD BEEN CAREFULLY DUSTING THE COLLEGE TROPHIES ON THE MANTEL HURRIED TO HER SIDE
BUT HERE WAS THE SINGULAR FEATURE
AND HERE SHE HAD BEEN WONDERING HOW SHE COULD EVER GET TO KNOW SOME STRANGER WELL ENOUGH TO PUT HER QUESTIONS
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE
BACK ACROSS THE DRAWING-ROOM AND HALL THEY WENT AND THROUGH THE DINING-ROOM
I GUESS THESE MUST HAVE BEEN THE SERVANTS ROOMS REMARKED CYNTHIA
A LONG LIBRARY TABLE WITH AN OLD-FASHIONED READING-LAMP STOOD IN THE MIDDLE
MOMSIE WANTED TO KNOW HOW I'D TORN MINE AND GOT IT SO MUSSY TOO
BUT THE WORD HAD NEVER COME AND HOPE WAS NOW QUITE DEAD
I'M GOING TO POKE AMONG THESE ASHES SHE ANNOUNCED
BUT STILL THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THE ROOM TO CHALLENGE INTEREST AND JOYCE PULLED HER COMPANION ACROSS THE HALL TOWARD ANOTHER PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR
AND IF WE TRIED TO GET THEM FROM HOME SOME ONE WOULD SUSPECT RIGHT AWAY TEN CENTS WORTH OF CANDLES OUGHT TO LAST US QUITE A WHILE BEGAN THE PRACTICAL CYNTHIA
HERE'S HIS BIG BUSINESSLIKE-LOOKING DESK AND IN PRETTY GOOD ORDER TOO
NEVERTHELESS I WORKED MY WAY TO THE FAR WEST PARTLY ON FOOT AND PARTLY IN THE SLOW STAGE-COACHES OF THAT PERIOD
THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL--HE WAS GONE
INSTEAD JOYCE SUDDENLY BROKE INTO A LAUGH
FOLKS HAD FIRST BEEN SITTING IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND THEN WENT TO THE DINING-ROOM FOR DINNER
I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME MERCY JOYCE
EVEN IF WE GOT OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN THEY'D BE SURE TO DISCOVER US SOONER OR LATER
SO WE'D BETTER ECONOMIZE TILL ALLOWANCE DAY TELL YOU WHAT CRIED JOYCE FRESHLY INSPIRED
ONLY I KNOW WE DID WRONG IN THE BEGINNING EVER TO COME IN HERE AT ALL
IT'S--IT'S THE SADDEST THING I EVER HEARD CYNTHIA HAD RISEN TOO AND THEY LINKED ARMS STROLLING UP AND DOWN THE LITTLE ORCHARD AS THEY TALKED
THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE
OF ALL TIMES
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA!_--OF ALL PEOPLE
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT
PLAIN AS TOLD ME IT WAS NONE OF MY AFFAIRS THEN PERHAPS YOU COULD TELL US JOYCE WAS PERSISTING WHEN THE AGENT SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED TURNING ON HER SUSPICIOUSLY
I HAVE OFTEN AND OFTEN WONDERED WHY YOU NEVER CAME BACK TO THIS BEAUTIFUL OLD HOME OR AT LEAST SENT FOR THE BOOKS AND PICTURES AND LOVELY THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO RUIN HERE
AT THIS INSTANT THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN
THERE WAS ONE THAT DID KNOW SOON HOWEVER AND THAT WAS MRS DURAND
HE WAS AN ENORMOUS CAT AND HIS PURR WAS AS OVERSIZED AS HIS BODY
OTHER PEOPLE HAD TO USE HORRID OIL-LAMPS
WHAT A RELIEF THAT'LL BE AND SO ENDED THE ADVENTURE OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
IT'S AS DARK AS A POCKET BUT I SEE TWO THINGS LIKE BALLS OF FIRE,--THAT'S GOLIATH UP ON A BEAM I SUPPOSE
TELL ME HERE JOYCE GAVE HER A WARNING GLANCE BEFORE TURNING AWAY
WHY THE DOOR IS OPEN
YOU MUST NOT HOWEVER THINK THAT IN ALL THESE YEARS AND THESE ABSORBING INTERESTS I HAD FORGOTTEN MY MOTHER
YES LET'S SHE ASSENTED
I WASN'T STARING JOYCE REPLIED AND BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
IT IS SILLY TO CONTINUE KEEPING SO MUM ABOUT IT AND WE MIGHT GET SOME GOOD NEW POINTS
AND OH CYNTHIA
HELLO
CHILDREN I AM AN OLD WOMAN
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAYS SHE WILL NEVER FORGET HIS EXCITED HAPPY LOOK
ONCE IN CALIFORNIA I BECAME DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE GOLD MINES WHERE I WAS CERTAIN LIKE MANY ANOTHER DELUDED ONE THAT I WAS SHORTLY GOING TO AMASS AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE
NO I COULD NEVER ALLOW EVEN THE HINT OF SUCH A SUSPICION
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA
WHY CERTAINLY CONTINUED JOYCE
SO THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT
WELL I SUPPOSE WE WILL HAVE TO GIVE IT ALL UP
THEY HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR A LONG LONG WHILE
PLEASE CALL THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WITH THE PROOF WHAT YOU CALL THINGS IN GEOMETRY ARGUED JOYCE WHETHER IT'S ANGLES OR ANGELS OR CATERPILLARS OR COAL-SCUTTLES,--IT'S ALL THE SAME IN THE END CYNTHIA IGNORED THIS SWALLOWED HER RISING WRATH AND DOGGEDLY BEGAN ANEW
WHATEVER IT WAS,--BAD NEWS EITHER WAY,--IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ONE OF TWO THINGS
MERCY EXCLAIMED JOYCE BETWEEN TWO SNEEZES THAT ALMOST KNOCKED ME OFF MY FEET
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ONE NEARER THAN THAT TO MATTER SO MUCH I THINK IT'S MOST LIKELY HER HUSBAND THEN DECIDED CYNTHIA
THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING TO SEE ANYWAY
BUT THEY'RE ROTTEN CYNTHIA HELPED SECRETLY VERY RELUCTANT AND FEARFUL OF CONSEQUENCES AND THEY SOON HAD THE LITTLE WINDOW FREE OF OBSTRUCTIONS
I'LL GO OVER THAT MYSELF MONDAY MORNING
I THINK THAT WOMAN MUST HAVE HAD A--A HEART OF STONE TO BE SO UNFORGIVING TO HER SON--AFTER READING THIS SHE NEVER SAW IT ANNOUNCED JOYCE WITH A POSITIVENESS THAT MADE CYNTHIA STARE
OUR DOOR IS JUST ACROSS THE HALL
SOMETIMES THEY TALKED IN LOW VOICES COMMENTING ON THE SCENE THEN THEY WOULD BE SILENT FOR A LONG PERIOD SIMPLY DRINKING IT IN AND TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH IT FOREVER ON THEIR MEMORIES
I TOLD HER I'D BEEN CHASING UP GOLIATH,--WHICH WAS REALLY QUITE TRUE YOU KNOW I NEVER CAN THINK OF THINGS TO SAY THAT WILL BE THE TRUTH AND YET NOT GIVE THE WHOLE THING AWAY SIGHED THE DOWNRIGHT CYNTHIA
THEN CAME THE STRANGE NOTE THIS MORNING WHICH I BELIEVE YOU MISS JOYCE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
I DON'T SUPPOSE SHE FELT IT RIGHT TO DO IT
I NEVER KNEW OR HEARD OF ANYTHING THAT WENT SO--SO DEEP IN ME AS THIS THING HAS
DECREPIT FURNITURE OF AN ANCIENT DATE HAD FOUND A REFUGE THERE
THE PROFESSOR DRONED ON
SO HE DID NOT LIVE VERY LONG YOU SEE
OH HOW--HOW SUDDEN
IN THE REACTION OF RELIEF CYNTHIA SEIZED GOLIATH SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND--CRIED
THAT'S ABSURD
DON'T SCOLD
SHE WAS A VERY OLD LADY A CONFIRMED INVALID WHO LIVED IN POUGHKEEPSIE
I ALWAYS HATED IT--THIS NORTHERN LIFE--AND THOUGH I LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT
JUST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY SHOULD TAKE IT INTO HIS HEAD TO GET IN HERE TO-DAY
THE MINIATURE WAS OF THE SAME PERSON WHOSE PICTURE IS TURNED TO THE WALL DOWN-STAIRS CHAPTER VI JOYCE'S THEORY CYNTHIA WHAT'S YOUR THEORY ABOUT THE MYSTERY OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE THE TWO GIRLS WERE SITTING IN A FAVORITE NOOK OF THEIRS UNDER AN OLD BENT APPLE-TREE IN THE YARD BACK OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE ON A SUNNY MORNING A WEEK LATER
JOYCE SCORNED TO ARGUE FURTHER ALONG THIS LINE
WHO--WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER
AND WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WERE NO MORE TO BE FOUND JOYCE ANNOUNCED
AT THE BACK WAS A SMALL ORCHARD OF ANCIENT CHERRY-TREES AND NEAR THE REAR DOOR A WELL-CURB WITH THE GREAT SWEEP HALF ROTTED AWAY
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE
THEN ALL SHE COULD FIND TO SAY WAS
I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS HAPPENING
HE MUST HAVE RECEIVED IT THIS MORNING CYNTHIA HAD LISTENED TO THIS LONG EXPLANATION IN ASTONISHED SILENCE
THERE WERE OTHER SEASONS WHEN THEY WOULD SIT SILENT YET UTTERLY UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER FOR EQUALLY PROLONGED PERIODS
LADIES WERE ALWAYS DOING THAT YEARS AGO ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HEARD BAD NEWS GOOD ENOUGH AGREED JOYCE
HE'D MATTER MOST OF ALL YES I'VE THOUGHT OF THAT BUT HERE'S THE OBJECTION
SO THERE IF CYNTHIA IMAGINED SHE HAD ENDED THE ARGUMENT WITH JOYCE BY ANY SUCH REASONING SHE WAS DOOMED TO DISAPPOINTMENT
SUDDENLY SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND SEIZED THE LADY'S HAND
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHERS INVITED ABOUT A DOZEN IN ALL
I NEVER HAD SO MANY SURPRISES ALL AT ONCE IN MY LIFE
THEY PULLED OPEN THE DOOR AND PLUNGED THROUGH IT ONLY TO FIND THEMSELVES IN SOME SORT OF A CLOSET GROPING AMONG MUSTY CLOTHES THAT WERE HANGING THERE
I EVEN THOUGHT THAT IF I FOUND I COULD ENDURE THE MEMORIES I WOULD LIVE IN IT A WHILE FOR THE SAKE OF THE OLD HAPPY YEARS WITH MY LITTLE BOY
CYNTHIA SETTLED DOWN METHODICALLY AND STUDIOUSLY AS WAS HER WONT
I HAD ALWAYS FROM A SMALL CHILD BEEN PASSIONATELY FOND OF ADVENTURE AND YEARNED TO SEE OTHER REGIONS AND TEST MY FORTUNE IN NEW AND UNTRIED WAYS
BUT COME ALONG
BUT COME ALONG
ANGLE A EQUALS ANGLE B BUT JOYCE WHO WAS A BORN TEASE COULD NO MORE RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF BAITING CYNTHIA THAN SHE COULD HAVE REFUSED A CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM SODA SO SHE CONTINUED TO MAKE FOOLISH AND IRRELEVANT COMMENTS ON EVERY GEOMETRICAL STATEMENT UNTIL IN SHEER EXASPERATION CYNTHIA THREW THE BOOK ASIDE
NO JOYCE I'M NOT GOING TO RUN AWAY
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION TO ADD TO OUR CATECHISM
THEN SHE COMMENCED AFRESH BUT CASUALLY AS THOUGH THE IDEA HAD JUST ENTERED HER MIND
NEITHER OF THE GIRLS FELT AT LIBERTY TO OPEN BUREAU-DRAWERS OR PRY INTO CLOSETS AND TRUNKS
CLYDE SQUIRES NEW YORK THE CENTURY CO
SEE THERE CYNTHIA SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
ON THE DRESSING-TABLE ARTICLES OF THE TOILET WERE LITTERED ABOUT AND A PAIR OF CANDLESTICKS WERE SET CLOSE TO THE MIRROR
LET'S GET THEM RIGHT NOW WHILE THEY WERE MAKING THEIR PURCHASES CYNTHIA HAD ANOTHER IDEA
AND THEN CYNTHIA YIELDED AS SHE ALWAYS DID TO JOY'S ENTREATIES
WE CAN'T GO
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAYS THAT MRS COLLINGWOOD WAS MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN AND THAT SHE WAS THIRTY-FIVE WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED
SHE MUST HAVE GATHERED IT UP WITH HER THINGS AND TAKEN IT WITH HER
IT JUST CAME TO ME
LET'S JUST WAIT THERE WERE FAINT SOUNDS FROM THE DRAWING-ROOM BUT THEY WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE,--LOW MURMURINGS AND HALF-HUSHED SOBS
WHAT FUNNY CLOTHES HE WORE
ANTIQUE HAIR TRUNKS LINED THE SIDES UNDER THE EAVES AND QUAINT GARMENTS HUNG ABOUT ON PEGS
IF THAT ISN'T EXACTLY LIKE YOU
THE CANDLES WHICH HAD BEEN BURNING NOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS HAD UNNOTICED BY ALL BEEN GRADUALLY GUTTERING AND SPLUTTERING OUT
OF COURSE I'M WILLING TO GO IN FOR IT BUT I CAN'T GIVE MY SHARE TILL AFTER THE FIRST OF THE MONTH
AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND THEY HURRIED HOME TO LUNCHEON AGREEING TO MEET AT TWO FOR THE GREAT ILLUMINATION
DO YOU RECOGNIZE IT DEMANDED JOYCE
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAID THE PLACE WAS DELIGHTFUL,--AN OLD COLONIAL HOUSE IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO HEAR HER DESCRIBE EVERYTHING JUST AS WE'VE SEEN IT AND MRS COLLINGWOOD WAS A CHARMING HOSTESS
YOU HAVEN'T EXPLAINED ONE THING AT ALL WHAT'S THAT ASKED JOYCE
THEY WERE PICTURED AS SITTING HAND IN HAND ON A GREEN BANK UNDER A HUGE SPREADING TREE AND GAZING SOLEMNLY TOWARD A DISTANT CHURCH STEEPLE
THE OTHER WAS HER TWIN BROTHER
GOLIATH HAD EVIDENTLY PRECEDED THEM FOR THEY FOUND HIM ONCE MORE CURLED UP ON THE SOFT RUG BEFORE THE FIREPLACE
BUT WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULD JUST THAT ROOM BE LOCKED ANYWAY
IT IS NOW HIGH TIME TO INTRODUCE THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN STARING US OUT OF COUNTENANCE EVER SINCE THIS STORY BEGAN
BUT NOW JOYCE SUDDENLY LOOKED UP AND PERCEIVED WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THERE FOR A MOMENT THEY STOOD SURVEYING ANEW THE CURIOUS SCENE
AND ALL THE TIME WAR HAD BEEN THREATENING SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING TO RAISE A COMPANY IN SOUTH CAROLINA FOR HER SON FAIRFAX AND PUT HIM IN COMMAND OF IT
THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER
OH THAT'S GOLIATH SAID JOYCE CALMLY
I OUGHT TO GO AGAIN SOON
THEY ENTWINED ARMS NOW AMIABLY ENOUGH AND STROLLED AWAY TO COLLECT THEIR BOOKS AND LEAVE FOR HOME
TEN OR TWELVE ADDED YEARS HAD SLIPPED BY AND IT DID NOT SEEM HUMAN THAT SHE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FEEL BITTERLY TOWARD ME
IT WAS OF A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN AND BEFORE IT THE GIRLS STOPPED FASCINATED TO GAZE A LONG WHILE
THAT IS HE MAKES UP A STORY OF HIS OWN FROM THE FEW THINGS HE HAS FOUND OUT BEFORE HE GETS AT THE WHOLE TRUTH WELL REPLIED CYNTHIA LAYING ASIDE HER LATIN GRAMMAR SINCE YOU ASK ME MY THEORY IS THAT SOME ONE COMMITTED A MURDER IN THAT ROOM WE CAN'T GET IN THEN LOCKED IT UP AND WENT AWAY AND HAD THE HOUSE ALL BOARDED UP SO IT WOULDN'T BE DISCOVERED
DECIDING TO EXPLORE THE ATTIC FIRST THEY FOUND THAT A DOOR FROM THE UPPER HALL OPENED ON A STAIRWAY LEADING TO IT
I'LL TELL YOU CYNTHIA AND I SUPPOSE YOU'LL THINK ME QUEER THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY I'D RATHER NOT DO IT RIGHT NOW
WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL
FIRST THEY TOOK TURNS SWEEPING AS BEST THEY COULD WITH A VERY ANCIENT AND FROWSY BROOM THE THICK MOTH-EATEN CARPET
IF IT HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY OF COURSE THEIR SEARCH WAS USELESS
BUT FOR SEVERAL REASONS I DID NOT DO THIS
IT WAS ANOTHER BEDROOM THE LARGEST SO FAR AND ITS ASPECT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE OTHERS
BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN
BOTH GIRLS UTTERED A LOW FRIGHTENED SHRIEK AND CLUNG TOGETHER
I WAS SO GLAD BECAUSE THEN I COULD STAY HOME AND TALK TO GREAT-AUNT LUCIA AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D BEEN WITH HER LONG ALONE
WHY HOW STRANGE--HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
THIS WAS A HOUSE OF MYSTERY
NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED AND THE GIRLS RESUMED THEIR SEAT ON THE VERANDA STEPS
SO DOES GOLIATH 56 VI JOYCE'S THEORY 68 VII GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY 79 VIII CYNTHIA HAS AN IDEA 90 IX THE MEMORIES OF GREAT-AUNT LUCIA 107 X AN EXCITING DISCOVERY 122 XI THE ROOM THAT WAS LOCKED 135 XII A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT 145 XIII THE GREAT ILLUMINATION 154 XIV THE MEDDLING OF CYNTHIA 166 XV THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR 173 XVI JOYCE EXPLAINS 184 XVII IN WHICH ALL MYSTERIES ARE SOLVED 192 LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS BOTH GIRLS GASPED AND STARED INCREDULOUSLY FRONTISPIECE A FLIGHT OF STAIRS COULD BE DIMLY DISCERNED 19 THEY STARED WITH THE FASCINATION OF HORROR 43 WELL WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT CAN BE QUERIED CYNTHIA 61 DO YOU KNOW ANY REAL ELDERLY PEOPLE FATHER 99 OH I WISH I WERE SHERLOCK HOLMES 125 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SIT AND ENJOY THE SPECTACLE 161 THEN WITH ONE ACCORD THEY BEGAN TO STEER THEIR WAY AROUND THE FURNITURE 213 CHAPTER I GOLIATH LEADS THE WAY CYNTHIA SAT ON HER VERANDA STEPS CHIN IN HAND GAZING DOLEFULLY AT THE GRAY SEPTEMBER SKY
WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THAT HOUSE MUST HAVE CONCERNED TWO PERSONS AT LEAST
THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
YOU SEE REMARKED CYNTHIA
AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY
IT'S YOUR STILL INSISTING THAT WE KEEP FROM MENTIONING THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE TO OUTSIDERS
HE MAKES THINGS SEEM MORE NATURAL SOMEHOW THEY REACHED THE END OF THE HALL AND JOYCE FUMBLED FOR THE HANDLE THIS DOOR CONTRARY TO THE USUAL RULE BEING SHUT
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SUN HAD SLUNK SHAMEFACEDLY BEHIND A HIGH RISING BANK OF CLOUD AND ITS RETIRING HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A RAW CHILLY WIND
WELL YOU KNOW THE REST AND HE STOPPED ABRUPTLY
THE COAT HAD SOME OF MY PERSONAL PAPERS IN IT BUT I DID NOT THINK OF THAT AT THE TIME
NO--YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM
MOST OF THEIR BEDS ARE MADE AND THEY LEFT EVERYTHING IN A MUSS DOWN-STAIRS
DISCRETION HOWEVER SEEMED TO ME THE BETTER PART OF VALOR AND I DECIDED TO GIVE THE NAME THAT I HAD BORNE DURING MY FIRST YEARS IN CALIFORNIA TILL I COULD ASCERTAIN MORE DEFINITELY JUST WHAT THE SITUATION WAS
WHAT DO YOU SAY IT'LL COST YOU A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN A DOLLAR REMARKED CYNTHIA AFTER AN INTERVAL SPENT IN CALCULATION
IT TOOK HIM NEARLY ALL DAY TO FINISH THE WORK WHILE SHE STOOD AROUND AND GAVE DIRECTIONS
WELL DON'T YOU SEE ONE OF THEM--THE GIRL--WAS OUR LOVELY LADY
BUT THE TIME HAS COME WHEN IT MUST BE DONE
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
HOW SHE CAN TALK AND THE STORIES SHE CAN TELL ABOUT OLD TIMES SAID MR KENWAY WAXING ENTHUSIASTIC
I HEARD FATHER SAY ONCE THAT IT WAS FURNISHED THROUGHOUT AND LEFT EXACTLY AS IT WAS,--SO SOME ONE TOLD HIM SOME OLD LADY I THINK HE SAID
BUT WHY NOT WAIT TILL SOME BRIGHT SUNNY DAY
MRS COLLINGWOOD LISTENED WITH DEEP ATTENTION
MIND YOUR HEAD
AND TO THINK WE'VE NEGLECTED SUCH A MYSTERY AT OUR FRONT DOORS AS YOU MIGHT SAY ALL THESE YEARS AND SHE DRAGGED THE PROTESTING CYNTHIA TOWARD THE CELLAR STAIRS
THE DRAWING-ROOM IS ALL RIGHT,--JUST LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER PARLOR WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SITTING BEFORE IT WAS PUT TO RIGHTS
AND THEN TO LOSE HIS LIFE ALMOST IN THE BEGINNING
BUT JOYCE WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO-NIGHT SHE MUSED
IT ISN'T JUST IDLE CURIOSITY AS PROFESSOR MARLOW WOULD CALL IT
I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES
I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
WELL I RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA A RICH MAN ABLE TO INDULGE MYSELF IN ANY FORM OF AMUSEMENT OR ADVENTURE THAT PLEASED ME
AND TO THE AMAZEMENT OF EVERY ONE JOYCE BROKE DOWN AND BEGAN TO SOB HYSTERICALLY EXCLAIMING OH I'M SO GLAD--SO GLAD BETWEEN EVERY OTHER SOB
TWO CHAIRS AND ANOTHER TABLE WERE HEAPED WITH MATERIAL AND WITH GARMENTS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF COMPLETION
EVERYTHING WAS CONFUSION FOR A FEW MINUTES TILL SHE PRESENTLY CAME TO
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT EVEN YEARS AND YEARS AGO ANY ONE IN A BIG HOUSE LIKE THIS COULD COMMIT A MURDER AND THEN CALMLY LOCK UP AND WALK AWAY AND THE MATTER NEVER BE INVESTIGATED
AND WE MUST COME HERE OFTEN
I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT SHE SAID AT LAST
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT WELL I HAVE--SOMETIMES AT LEAST--AND ONCE IN A LONG WHILE DO YOU KNOW I'VE EVEN DREAMED I WAS EXPLORING IT
WE MIGHT PRY IT OPEN WITH THAT SHE SUGGESTED
SHE PASSED IT ALONG TO JOYCE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND RETURNED TO CAESAR IN A MORE CHEERFUL FRAME OF MIND
THE BEAMS OVERHEAD WERE THICK WITH COBWEBS HANGING LIKE GRAY PORTIERES FROM EVERY PROJECTION
PERHAPS SHE NEEDS HELP NO I THINK SHE JUST WANTS TO BE BY HERSELF
IT'S WONDERFUL BUT CYNTHIA HAD TURNED AND SNATCHED UP GOLIATH
BUT THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS I CAN'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL
MY HEART IS SET ON IT VERY WELL THEN ASSENTED JOYCE
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA DID NOT SEE HER AGAIN TILL A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN SHE RECEIVED AN INVITATION TO GO WITH HER FRIEND TAKE LUNCHEON AND SPEND THE DAY AT MRS COLLINGWOOD'S
IT'S THE ONE THING WE NEVER COULD ACCOUNT FOR
DO YOU HEAR ANYTHING
BUT JOYCE HAD NEVER VISITED THIS RELATIVE IN HER LIFE AND NEVER PARTICULARLY WANTED TO AND IT WOULD APPEAR STRANGE TO SEEM SUDDENLY SO ANXIOUS TO SEE THE OLD LADY
I CANNOT NOW DETAIL TO YOU ALL MY WANDERINGS AND ADVENTURES
THIS AFTERNOON RIGHT AFTER LUNCH SO THE AFTERNOON FOUND THEM AGAIN IN THE DIM MUSTY OLD LIBRARY ILLUMINATING THE SCENE EXTRAVAGANTLY WITH FIVE CANDLES
I CANNOT TAKE BACK MY PROMISE
BUSINESS ALL TRANSACTED THROUGH LAWYERS IN NEW YORK AND THEY WON'T OPEN THEIR HEADS ABOUT IT
WE TALKED THAT ALL OVER BEFORE
THEY'RE NICER AND HANDIER THAN OUR TIN ONE
THE TWO REUNITED ONES WITHIN WERE BRIDGING THE GULF OF FORTY YEARS
WHERE ARE THE MATCHES CYNTHIA
JOYCE CLUTCHED CYNTHIA GAVE ONE LITTLE SHRIEK HALF-RELIEF AND HALF-LAUGHTER AND GASPED
I ADDRESSED THE LETTER TO HIS HOTEL AND DECIDED THAT IT MUST BE MAILED THAT VERY NIGHT FOR HE MIGHT SUDDENLY LEAVE THERE AND I'D NEVER KNOW WHERE ELSE TO FIND HIM
THEN SHE WENT ON
I'M JUST CURIOUS TO FIND OUT HIS BUNK JOYCE WAS SLIM AND DARK AND ELFIN FULL OF QUEER PRANKS SUDDEN ENTHUSIASTIC PLANS AND VERY VIVID OF IMAGINATION A CURIOUS CONTRAST TO THE PLACID SLOW-MOVING CYNTHIA
ON EACH SIDE WERE BEDROOMS FOUR IN ALL WITH SPARSE PLAIN FURNISHINGS AND COT-BEDS
WHAT'S THE MEETING OF AN OLD LITERARY SOCIETY COMPARED TO AN IMPORTANT THING LIKE THIS BUT WE COULD DO IT JUST AS WELL TO-MORROW I CAN'T WAIT TILL TO-MORROW CYNTHIA SPRAGUE AND THAT SETTLED THE MATTER
BUT YOU MUSTN'T DEPEND ON ME
IT WAS A BLEAK RAW DAY AND THEY FOUND MR WADE HUDDLED OVER A RED-HOT STOVE IN HIS LITTLE OFFICE
THESE TWO CHERUBIC INFANTS HAD BOTH BIG BROWN EYES FAT RED CHEEKS AND ADORABLE FLUFFY GOLDEN CURLS
WHEN THEY WERE HALF-WAY UP THE CELLAR STEPS JOYCE WHO WAS AHEAD SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
THE DOOR OF IT OPENS RIGHT INTO THIS BENT ON FURTHER DISCOVERY THEY OPENED THE CLOSED DOOR CAREFULLY
YOU SEE I HAVE TRAVELED MANY WEARY MILES TO HEAR THIS STRANGE STORY SO CYNTHIA BEGAN AT THE BEGINNING AND TOLD HOW THEY HAD FIRST FOUND THEIR WAY IN AND HAD THEN BECOME INTERESTED IN UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF THE OLD HOUSE
IN ITS DUSKY CORNERS STOOD SPINNING WHEELS AND WINDING-REELS
NO USE TO HURRY DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA,--MY MOTHER BEING DEAD
IT WAS A MINIATURE AN IVORY ONE BUT THE FIRE HAS ENTIRELY DESTROYED THE LIKENESS
IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING-ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
THE FURNITURE IN THE HALL CONSISTED OF SEVERAL TALL STRAIGHT-BACKED CHAIRS SET AT INTERVALS AGAINST THE WALLS AND AT ONE SIDE A MASSIVE TABLE COVERED THICK WITH THE DUST OF YEARS
IN THE MORNING WE'LL GO TO THE LIBRARY AND LOOK UP THAT BOOK OF COSTUMES
THE REGION WAS AT THAT TIME PRACTICALLY A TRACKLESS WILDERNESS AND TO BRAVE IT AT ALL WAS CONSIDERED THE LIMIT OF FOLLY
THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MR FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE
THEY STARTED ON THEIR EXPEDITION THAT VERY AFTERNOON
OF COURSE THOSE BABIES ARE TWINS BROTHER AND SISTER
THE GIRLS UNDERSTOOD IT IN A FLASH
DO YOU REALIZE THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOU THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED
IT MADE A STATEMENT THAT WAS NEW TO ME INDEED AND MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR MANY THINGS
WE CAN'T MOVE THESE BOOKS AND SHELVES AWAY FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME THEY FELL TO WORK WITH A ZEST THE LIKE OF WHICH THEY HAD NOT KNOWN SINCE THEIR FIRST ENTRANCE INTO THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
THEN WITH ONE ACCORD THEY ALL ROSE AND BEGAN TO STEER THEIR WAY AROUND THE FURNITURE TOWARD THE HALL GOLIATH FOLLOWING
BUT LET'S GO AND FINISH OUR STUDYING NOW AND GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY
NO I SOMEHOW DON'T THINK SHE KNEW THEY DID THEIR DUSTING IN THE LOCKED-UP ROOM AND TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK AS SHIP-SHAPE AS POSSIBLE CAREFULLY AVOIDING HOWEVER THE VICINITY OF THE DESK
OH JOYCE
WHERE ARE YOU BOTH LITTLE LADIES
TO CYNTHIA SPRAGUE AND JOYCE KENWAY IT HAD WHEN THEY FIRST CAME TO LIVE ON EITHER SIDE OF IT SOME FIVE YEARS BEFORE AFFORDED FOR A WHILE AN ENDLESS SOURCE OF ATTRACTION
SHE WAS INDEED TOO DEEPLY INDIGNANT AND MOREOVER HAD IMMERSED HERSELF IN HER WORK
THEN THERE'S SOME ONE ELSE
VERY SHORTLY THERE WERE NO MORE COOKIES
I'VE THE LOVELIEST IDEA
I'VE THE LOVELIEST IDEA
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DREADFUL THING TO MAKE THE LOVELY LADY DESERT THAT HOUSE FOREVER
WHAT GEESE WE ARE TO HAVE WAITED SO LONG
WHAT IF WE CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR AT THE TOP CONJECTURED CYNTHIA
IT WILL BE EASIER
DOESN'T HE SEEM AT HOME HERE LAUGHED CYNTHIA
DO YOU SEE THAT BIG CHAIR WITH ITS BACK CLOSE TO THE MANTEL SHE EXCLAIMED
ANYHOW THE LOVELY LADY WAS SO TERRIBLY SHOCKED BY IT THAT SHE DISMISSED HER DINNER PARTY RIGHT AWAY
BY THIS TIME JOYCE WAS SO PARALYZED WITH FRIGHT THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY MOVE A LIMB AND SPEECH HAD ENTIRELY DESERTED HER
BECAUSE IT CONFUSES ME SO I CAN'T THINK SAID CYNTHIA
I PICTURED HIM AS SLIM AND YOUNG LOOKING SMOOTH-FACED WITH GOLDEN CURLY HAIR AND BIG BROWN EYES
SOMETHING WAS CERTAINLY OUTSIDE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
DON'T YOU SEE HOW ALL THE INSIDE SHUTTERS ARE CLOSED AND THE VELVET CURTAINS DRAWN
TELL YOU WHAT
COME!--QUICK!--QUICK WHISPERED JOYCE
BUT WHAT WAS I TO DO ABOUT IT
BUT AT LAST THE CLOSING-BELL RANG AND AFTER WHAT SEEMED INTERMINABLE AND TOTALLY UNNECESSARY DELAYS CYNTHIA FOUND HERSELF OUT OF DOORS ARM-IN-ARM WITH JOYCE
MOTHER FORBADE ME TOO LONG BEFORE YOU CAME OUT AND WE COUNTED ON IT SO
NOW DO LET ME FINISH MY PAPER IN PEACE DUCKIE DEAR JOYCE SAID NO MORE AND TURNED AGAIN TO HER STUDIES
IT'S JUST DARK BECAUSE IT'S BOARDED UP OUTSIDE THAT'S PRECISELY IT ANNOUNCED JOYCE
WELL YOU CERTAINLY MAY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE GREAT BEDROOM WHERE WERE SO MANY SIGNS OF AGITATION AND HURRIED DEPARTURE DECIDING THAT HERE WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY FIELD FOR DISCOVERY
AT LENGTH THEY FOUND THEY HAD SKIMMED THROUGH ALL THE VOLUMES OF PUNCH THE LAST OF WHICH WAS DATED 1860 AND HAD THEM PILED UP ON THE FLOOR BESIDE THEM
WHATEVER IT WAS IT DOESN'T HELP MUCH NOW
NEVERTHELESS A FEW MONTHS LATER I WROTE AGAIN WITH NO BETTER RESULT
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THESE TWO COMPANIONS COULD TALK FRANTICALLY FOR HOURS ON A STRETCH
BESIDES AS CYNTHIA WISELY SUGGESTED IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT ANY ONE WOULD LOCK A DOOR SO CAREFULLY AND THEN PUT THE KEY IN A DRAWER OR TRUNK OR ON A SHELF
LET'S SLIP DOWN CELLAR AND OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW AND PERHAPS WE CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
AT ANY OTHER TIME OR IN ANY OTHER HOUSE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THIS ATTIC OF ABSORBING INTEREST
THEREFORE I LET THE REPORT STAND
NEVER DARE TO BREATHE IT
AND FOR FIVE CENTS WE CAN GET A CANDLESTICK BUT WE'D BETTER STOP AT ONE FOR THE PRESENT OR WE WON'T HAVE A CENT LEFT BETWEEN US
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MISS CYNTHIA'S LETTER I SHOULD NEVER HAVE COME
SO THEY INVITED HIM TO ACCOMPANY THEM AN INVITATION WHICH HE ACCEPTED WITH ARCHED BACK AND RESOUNDING PURR
A GREAT CANDELABRUM HUNG FROM THE CEILING WITH SCONCES FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED CANDLES AND ORNAMENTED WITH GLITTERING CRYSTAL PENDANTS
THE GIRLS STOOD ON TIPTOE TO WATCH THE CHASE
IS THIS WHAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING ALL THE FUSS ABOUT WAIT SAID JOYCE
I WISH YOU WOULD GO HOME WELL I WON'T RETORTED JOYCE GIGGLING INWARDLY BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN DEVICES IF YOU LIKE AND SHE ROSE FROM THE TABLE WALKED WITH GREAT DIGNITY TO A DISTANT ROCKING-CHAIR SEATED HERSELF IN IT AND PRETENDED TO READ THE DAILY PAPER WHICH SHE HAD REMOVED FROM ITS SEAT
DO WHY THERE'S JUST ONE THING TO DO AND THAT IS MOVE THE SHELVES OUT SOMEHOW,--THEY SEEM TO BE MOVABLE JUST RESTING ON THOSE END-SUPPORTS,--AND GET AT THAT DOOR BUT SUPPOSE IT'S LOCKED WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON THAT
YOU ACT SO
BUT JOYCE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT SOMETHING ELSE
AND HELP ME BREAK THESE OTHER BOARDS AWAY
AND ALL THAT FOLLOWS MRS DURAND TOLD GREAT-AUNT LUCIA LONG LONG LONG AFTERWARD MRS COLLINGWOOD CAME INTO THE HOUSE AND HER FACE LOOKED SET LIKE A STONE AND SHE SEEMED TWENTY YEARS OLDER THAN WHEN SHE WAS HAVING THE LUNCHEON
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY ACTUAL WRONG OR HARMING ANYTHING
I'VE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU BUT IT ISN'T TIME TO START YET OBJECTED CYNTHIA AND I'M ONLY HALF THROUGH BREAKFAST
THEY TURNED IN TIME TO SEE HIM CLAMBERING THROUGH THE WINDOW
THE SECOND SAW THEM OUT OF THE ROOM AND INTO THE LONG HALL
YOU KNOW HE DISCOVERED IT FIRST AND SO GOLIATH FOLLOWED INTO THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
I WONDER IF MRS COLLINGWOOD WOULD OBJECT TO MY ASKING ABOUT IT NO INDEED DEAR CHILD REPLIED THAT LADY
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK
DON'T LET'S GO IN THERE
JOYCE I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS STUDYING BUT SO AM I INSISTED THE WICKED JOYCE
HOW STRANGE MURMURED CYNTHIA
SHE MUST HAVE DROPPED IT ACCIDENTALLY PERHAPS WHEN SHE TOOK IT OFF AND IT ROLLED UNDER THE BED
SHE TALKED TO ME A GREAT DEAL BUT I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO MENTION THIS PLACE TO HER AT ALL TILL THE LAST EVENING WE WERE THERE
I EVEN HAD MY TRUNKS PACKED AND MY TICKET BOUGHT WHEN SUDDENLY I CAME DOWN WITH TYPHOID FEVER SO SEVERE AN ATTACK THAT IT WAS THOUGHT I COULD NOT LIVE
WE MIGHT HAVE A GAME OF TENNIS TOO BEFORE IT RAINS JOYCE SAT BACK ON HER HEELS AND LOOKED HER COMPANION STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
THEY MOVED AROUND IT CAREFULLY AND BENT TO EXAMINE THE PRETTY DELFT TILES THAT FRAMED THE YAWNING CHIMNEY-PLACE BELOW THE MANTEL
I'M JUST CRAZY TO CYNTHIA STARED AND SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
THE TWO EXPLORERS TURNED TO GAZE AT IT AFRESH
SO THAT EXPLAINS WHY MY MOTHER NEVER RECEIVED ANY OF THEM
PARDON ME BEGAN JOYCE ALWAYS THE SPOKESMAN BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION OR TWO ABOUT THE OLD BOARDED-UP HOUSE ON ORCHARD AVENUE NOW THE AGENT WAS APPARENTLY NOT IN THE BEST OF SPIRITS THAT DAY
MORE PORTRAITS AND PAINTINGS SHONE DIMLY FROM THE WALLS
WE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU KNEW THE OWNERS WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHAT THEIR NAMES ARE NO I DON'T HE REITERATED
THE PASSING WINTER HAD BEEN FILLED WITH SUCH VARIED OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWO GIRLS THAT THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE AND STILL LESS TO DO ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATING WITHIN IT
IT MUST HAVE MADE QUITE AN IMPRESSION ON ME BECAUSE I WAS A GOOD DEAL YOUNGER AND DIDN'T GENERALLY LISTEN MUCH TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING AT TABLE WELL ANNOUNCED CYNTHIA STILL STANDING WHERE SHE HAD STOPPED AND SPEAKING WITH GREAT POSITIVENESS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO NOW AND THAT IS FIND OUT WHO THE OLD LADY IS AND HUNT HER UP I SUPPOSE I CAN FIND OUT HER NAME FROM FATHER--IF HE REMEMBERS IT--BUT WHAT THEN
THE APARTMENT ACROSS THE HALL PROVED TO BE THE DRAWING-ROOM
WHAT IS IT
THERE'S GRANDFATHER LAMBERT AND YOUR GREAT-AUNT LUCIA AND OLD MR SELBY AND--OH I CAN'T THINK JOYCE
WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE SHE LOCKED THE DOOR WALKED TO THE STATION TOOK THE TRAIN FOR NEW YORK AND CAME TO MRS DURAND JOYCE PAUSED IN HER RECITAL FROM SHEER LACK OF BREATH AND CYNTHIA TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SILENCE
WAIT SAID JOYCE
OH JOYCE GASPED CYNTHIA STICKING HER HEAD THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE DARK WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT HERE LAUGHED JOYCE FROM BELOW
THERE'S THE ATTIC YET AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND THAT KEY TOO WITH A GAY GOOD-BY THEY SEPARATED EACH TO HER HOME ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
SHE GRASPED THE CHISEL AND INSERTED IT IN THE CRACK PUSHING ON IT WITH ALL HER MIGHT
BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE
IT WILL DO NICELY TO LIGHT US OUT GROPING TO THE CHIMNEY-PLACE WITH THE AID OF HIS MATCHES MR COLLINGWOOD FOUND THE CANDLE AND LIT IT
BUT YOU GENERALLY PUT THINGS NICELY TO RIGHTS FIRST AND YOU DON'T GO AWAY AND FORGET MORE THAN HALF YOUR BELONGINGS
THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED
CHAPTER XVII IN WHICH ALL MYSTERIES ARE SOLVED AT LAST THE TWO ON THE STAIRCASE HEARD FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING THE DOOR AND A PLEASANT VOICE CALLED OUT
AND I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY SHOULD CONNECT US WITH IT SPECIALLY JOYCE CONSIDERED THE SUBJECT IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE
IT'S FRESHER AND MORE--MORE MODERN THAN THE REST OF THE PORTRAITS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND HALL
SHE MUST HAVE DISMISSED HER SERVANTS RIGHT AWAY THOUGH WHY SHE DIDN'T MAKE THEM CLEAR UP FIRST I CAN'T THINK
OH WOULDN'T I LIKE TO HAVE KNOWN HER
NEVER SPEAK OF THIS HOUSE AT ALL
IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN THE KEY GOOD GRACIOUS
THEN HE CALMLY LOCKS THE DOOR AND WALKS OFF WITH THE KEY
SUDDENLY SHE PAUSED STARED RUBBED AT SOMETHING WITH HER DUSTER AND BENDING CLOSE STARED AGAIN
ONE BOARD OF IT HAD THROUGH AGE AND DAMPNESS ROTTED AND FALLEN AWAY
WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
DO YOU KNOW SPOKE JOYCE IN A WHISPER AFTER THEY HAD LOOKED A LONG TIME I THINK I CAN GUESS PART OF AN EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS
SHE LOOKED YOUNGER TOO
WELL DON'T YOU SEE
BUSINESS HAD BEEN VERY DULL HE HAD TWO CHILDREN AT HOME SICK WITH MEASLES AND HE HIMSELF WAS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF A COLD
AND LATE THAT NIGHT SHE BROKE DOWN AND CRIED AND CRIED AND TOLD MRS DURAND EVERYTHING
WHY NO
IT WAS BETTER MORE INTERESTING THAN THE MOST ENGROSSING STORY THEY HAD EVER READ
MY DEAREST MOTHER,--THE BEST AND LOVELIEST THING IN MY LIFE,--I LEAVE THIS LAST APPEAL HERE IN THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE IT LATER READ IT AND FORGIVE ME
BUT AT LENGTH THEY HAD CREPT THROUGH THE CELLAR WINDOW LIGHTED THEIR CANDLES AND WERE PROCEEDING UP-STAIRS
THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE DRAWING-ROOM
WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS HUNT AROUND AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY NEWSPAPERS OF A LATER DATE
IT WAS NOW THE LAST PERIOD OF THE DAY AND HER IMPATIENCE HAD COMPLETELY CONQUERED HER USUAL ABSORBED ATTENTION TO HER STUDIES
SHE PROBABLY DID
SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE NOISE OF A CHAIR SCRAPING ON THE FLOOR AS IF IT HAD BEEN ACCIDENTALLY BRUSHED AGAINST
I WISH YOU'D GO HOME VERY WELL CYNTHIA I WILL ANSWERED JOYCE QUIETLY
YOU MUST LOOK UPON IT AS A SECOND HOME
HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
I SUPPOSE THE KITCHEN MUST BE IN THAT ONE BUT I CAN'T THINK WHAT'S IN THE OTHER UNLESS IT'S A LIBRARY
TELL ME ARE YOU A--A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
I WAS QUITE UNKNOWN WHERE I WAS AND I DECIDED AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY OUT WEST AND LIVE OUT MY LIFE FAR FROM THE SCENES OF SO MUCH UNHAPPINESS
IF THEIR RESPECTIVE MOTHERS HAD REQUESTED THEM TO PERFORM SO ARDUOUS A TASK AS THIS AT HOME THEY WOULD WITHOUT DOUBT HAVE BEEN INSTANTLY PLUNGED INTO DEEP DESPAIR
THIS FRIEND HAD THEN INTRODUCED THEM,--'MRS HUBERT KENWAY--MRS FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD MRS COLLINGWOOD CRIED CYNTHIA
CYNTHIA ARRANGED SIX CANDLES IN HOLDERS READY TO LIGHT AND THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS AGAIN TO ARRANGE THE OTHERS,--A TASK THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AS THE CANDELABRUM WAS RATHER HIGH AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO STAND ON CHAIRS
AND LONG BEFORE THEY CAME THERE LONG BEFORE EVER THEY WERE BORN OR ROCKRIDGE HAD BEGUN ITS MUSHROOM GROWTH AS A PRETTY MODERN COUNTRY TOWN THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE HAD STARED THE PASSERS-BY OUT OF COUNTENANCE WITH ALMOST IRRITATING PERSISTENCE
I HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM MY MOTHER THAT THESE LETTERS WERE NEVER RECEIVED BY HER WHICH IS A GREAT SURPRISE TO ME BUT I THINK I KNOW THE EXPLANATION
BUT WHEN I NOTICED THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE BOARDING STANDING OPEN I RESOLVED TO BEGIN MY INVESTIGATIONS RIGHT THERE AND I BOLDLY WENT UP AND KNOCKED
WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
I WOULD WAIT
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT DEMANDED CYNTHIA
MY ARMS ACHE AND SO DO YOURS
AT THAT POINT SHE PUT THE CANDLESTICK ON THE TABLE AND STOOD GAZING INTENTLY AT THE DUST-CLOTH
AND FINALLY I MENTIONED JUST CASUALLY THAT WE OFTEN PLAYED IN THE GROUNDS OF THIS OLD HOUSE NEXT DOOR AND DESCRIBED THE PLACE A LITTLE TO HER
AND AS THEY CREPT DOWN A DIM SQUARE OF GOOD HONEST DAYLIGHT SENT THEIR SPIRITS UP WITH A BOUND
THEY HAD SCARCELY BEEN IN IT LONG ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE IT WITH THE PALE FLAMES OF THEIR CANDLES BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT THEY WERE VERY NEAR THE HEART OF THE MYSTERY
OH LATER WILL DO SHE REMARKED CASUALLY AND STROLLED INTO THE SITTING-ROOM TO CHAT WITH MRS SPRAGUE
I VOTE WE GO AND LOOK HIM UP SHE HAD BEGUN WITH BUT A LANGUID INTEREST SEEKING ONLY TO PASS THE TIME AND HAD SUDDENLY ENDED UP WITH TREMENDOUS ENTHUSIASM
THEY SOMEHOW BORE A CLOSE RESEMBLANCE TO A PAIR OF EYES THAT STARED AND STARED AND STARED WITH CALM UNWINKING BLANKNESS
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER VALUABLE ONCE,--THERE'S GOLD ON IT
TWO NIGHTS AFTERWARD MRS DURAND WAS ASTOUNDED TO HAVE MRS COLLINGWOOD ARRIVE AT HER HOUSE IN NEW YORK AND BEG TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY THERE A DAY OR TWO
AND BESIDES HE SEEMS TO BELONG TO IT ANYWAY
END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE BY AUGUSTA HUIELL SEAMAN
HERE IT IS
AND IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT TOO
YOU CAN TELL BY THE ASHES AND THAT HALF-BURNED LOG
THEY BEGAN ON THE DRAWING-ROOM
AND DO YOU NOTICE CYNTHIA SHE HAS THE SAME BIG BROWN EYES OF THE GIRL-BABY IN THE PARLOR
I JUST WOULD
JOYCE GAVE A TINY GASP
I'M SURE IT IS A SECRET STAIRWAY AND THAT IT WAS LONG UNUSED EVEN BEFORE MRS COLLINGWOOD LEFT HERE
THAT HOWEVER FAR FROM DETERRING ME ATTRACTED ME ONLY THE MORE
IT SEEMS THAT GREAT-AUNT LUCIA TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO YOUNG MRS COLLINGWOOD
WHAT IF IT'S BEHIND SOME HEAVY PIECE OF FURNITURE WE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET IN SOMEHOW RESPONDED JOYCE
IN A CORNER OF THE LATTER TWO FUNNY LITTLE STEPS LED UP TO A DOOR AND ON OPENING IT THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE KITCHEN
AND THEN THAT DAY AT LUNCHEON SHE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIM SAYING HE HAD LEFT COLLEGE AND ENLISTED--_IN THE UNION ARMY_--AND WAS COMING HOME AT ONCE TO BID HER GOOD-BYE BEFORE GOING TO THE FRONT
DO YOU THINK SO SHE STAMMERED
DID TWO GIRLS EVER HAVE SUCH AN ADVENTURE BEFORE SHE CLASPED HER HANDS ECSTATICALLY FIRST HAVING PRESENTED THE CANDLE TO CYNTHIA BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO EXCITED TO HOLD IT
YOU REMEMBER LAST NIGHT HOW I SAT READING THE NEWSPAPER,--FIRST JUST TO TEASE YOU AND AFTERWARD I REALLY GOT INTERESTED IN IT
AND I'M AFRAID I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU--HOW YOU CAME TO BE IN HERE OH BEGAN CYNTHIA STUMBLINGLY I--I COULDN'T QUITE EXPLAIN IT ALL IN A LETTER--AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU'D PAY ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT I WROTE ANYWAY
WELL MRS DURAND PUT HER RIGHT TO BED,--SHE WAS FAIRLY SICK WITH NERVOUSNESS AND EXHAUSTION
THOSE WERE STRANGE YEARS MARVELOUS YEARS THAT I SPENT IN THE MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES OF UPPER CANADA
DON'T YOU JUST LONG TO KNOW WHAT THIS ROOM WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH THAT BIG CANDELABRUM GOING
MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM A FEW MOMENTS
I SEE
CYNTHIA PRUDENTLY REMAINED ON THE OUTSKIRTS THE QUEST DID NOT GREATLY INTEREST HER
HE HAD NOT BEEN HERE IN THE EAST FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND IT SAID HOW ASTOUNDED HE WAS AT THE REMARKABLE CHANGES THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING HIS LONG ABSENCE
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY THAT WOULD INTEREST US AND WE MIGHT GET SOME NEW CLUES
ALL RIGHT
AND SHE REMEMBERED IT
AT LENGTH ONLY FOUR OR FIVE FLAMES REMAINED FEEBLY WAVERING IN THEIR POOLS OF MELTED WAX
THERE SEEMED CONSEQUENTLY NO WAY TO OPEN THE DOOR
AND THIS ONE IS FROM WAY BACK IN 1850 WHY CYNTHIA THESE ARE THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS BUT CYNTHIA HAD ALREADY EXTRACTED ANOTHER VOLUME AND WAS ABSORBED IN IT CHUCKLING SOFTLY OVER THE OLD-TIME HUMOR
THERE WAS A BIG PICTURE HANGING OVER THE MANTEL
THAT'S RIGHT OVER THE LIBRARY I THINK AT THE END OF THE HALL
I WONDER WHERE TO-DAY'S PAPER IS
IT'S GOLIATH CHAPTER IV THE ROOM OF MYSTERY IT WAS INDEED GOLIATH
IN FACT I THINK IT'S BETTER
DEAR GIRLS I HARDLY NEED SAY TO YOU THAT IN ALL THE WORLD WE SHALL CONSIDER THAT WE HAVE NO CLOSER OR MORE DEVOTED FRIENDS THAN YOURSELVES
I CAN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF IT WELL JOY ANSWERED CYNTHIA YOU'VE A THEORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS SENSIBLE
AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS WALKED INTO THEM
I'M NOT SURE OUR FOLKS WOULD APPROVE OF IT
YOU'VE CERTAINLY BEEN INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION OF ILLUMINATION HALF A CENTURY AGO,--BUT WHY CYNTHIA
I SIMPLY CAN'T GET AWAY BEFORE
BUT I FORGIVE YOU
DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING IT MAY HAVE BEEN OR PERHAPS IT WAS JUST THE BROTHER ALONE WHEN HE WAS OLDER
I DON'T SEE THOUGH HOW YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU MUST GET AT IT IN OTHER WAYS DECLARED JOYCE BUT DID NOT EXPLAIN THE PROCESS JUST THEN
THEN SHE WENT AWAY AND NEVER NEVER CAME BACK ANY MORE YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE HOUSE OBJECTED CYNTHIA
AND AS FOR THE TWO GIRLS THEY WERE UTTERLY SPEECHLESS UNDER THE PRESSURE OF FEELING
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THE DUST-CLOTH GETTING INTO THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE THIS TIME WAS ACCOMPANIED BY LESS DIFFICULTY THAN THE FIRST
THE KNOWLEDGE WAS LIKE A KNIFE-WOUND IN MY HEART
IT WAS FINE OF YOU CYNTHIA TO SEND HER UP ALONE
CYNTHIA WE MUST BE IN THE ROOM BELONGING TO THE LOVELY LADY WHOSE PICTURE HANGS IN THE LIBRARY HOW DO YOU KNOW QUERIED CYNTHIA
I HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED
CYNTHIA CONSIDERED
FILLED WITH NEW HOPE OVER THIS FIND THE GIRLS HAD CONTINUED TO SEARCH DILIGENTLY THROUGH THE NEGLECTED OLD MANSION STRONG IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY WOULD EVENTUALLY DISCOVER IF NOT THE MISSING KEY AT LEAST A TRAIL OF CLUES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE UNRAVELING OF THE MYSTERY
HE WILL PROBABLY COME OUT AFTER A WHILE
CHAPTER XIV THE MEDDLING OF CYNTHIA TO JOYCE THE MOMENT THAT THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR WAS PUSHED OPEN WILL ALWAYS SEEM WITH PERHAPS ONE EXCEPTION THE MOST INTENSE OF ALL HER LIFE
AND A GREAT HOOP-SKIRT COLLAPSED LAY ON THE FLOOR ALONGSIDE
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE COURSE OF THEIR ADVENTURES IN THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE THEY FOUND THEMSELVES BEFORE AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER
I COULD NOT BEAR TO LEAVE THIS TASK TO OUTSIDERS
AS THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER TO DO BUT SIT AND ENJOY THE SPECTACLE THE TWO GIRLS CUDDLED DOWN ON A ROOMY OLD COUCH OR SOFA AND WATCHED WITH ALL THE FASCINATION THAT ONE WATCHES THE SOFT ILLUMINATION OF A CHRISTMAS-TREE
CYNTHIA HAD NOT YET HAD A MOMENT IN WHICH TO SPEAK WITH HER ALONE
CYNTHIA LOOKED UP WITH A FROWN FROM AN IRREGULAR LATIN CONJUGATION
WE MIGHT BE ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING
THEREFORE I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT TO MY LAST HOUR I SHALL LOVE YOU TRULY DEVOTEDLY
I LIKE THE LIBRARY AND THE PICTURE OF THE LOVELY LADY BEST ILLUSTRATION
IT'S HORRIBLY DIRTY AND STUFFY AND COBWEBBY IN HERE
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHY IT STANDS IN THAT POSITION WITH ITS BACK TO THE FIREPLACE
WHAT KIND OF BOOKS CAN THEY BE AND THEN ON FURTHER EXAMINATION,--"OH
THERE THERE LITTLE MOTHER OF MINE MURMURED HER SON
I THINK I'LL SIT DOWN SAID MRS COLLINGWOOD WHEN JOYCE HAD REGAINED CONTROL OF HERSELF
SO DOES GOLIATH YES THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THERE WAS NO VESTIGE OF A KEY
HOW DID HE GET IN HERE SOBBED CYNTHIA AT LENGTH
SHE WOULD NOT TELL MRS DURAND JUST WHAT HAPPENED BUT INTIMATED THAT THEY HAD HAD A DREADFUL SCENE
LOOK AT BATES'S PUP CHASING GOLIATH THE LATTER INDIVIDUAL WAS THE KENWAYS HUGE MALTESE CAT WELL DESERVING OF HIS NAME IN APPEARANCE BUT NOT IN NATURE FOR HE WAS KNOWN TO BE THE BIGGEST COWARD IN CAT-DOM
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER THEY HAD GONE THROUGH KINDERGARTEN AND DAY-SCHOOL TOGETHER AND WERE NOW ABREAST IN THEIR FIRST HIGH-SCHOOL YEAR
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT
WHEN THEY HAD GONE OVER IT ONCE AND TAKEN UP WHAT SEEMED LIKE A SMALL CART-LOAD OF DUST THEY FOUND THAT AFTER ALL THERE REMAINED ALMOST AS MUCH AS EVER ON THE FLOOR
THE HIGH OLD-FASHIONED FOUR-POST BED WITH ITS RUFFLED VALANCE AND TESTER WAS STILL SMOOTHLY MADE UP AND UNDISTURBED
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN THIS NEXT ROOM
OLD GRUDGES THEY TOLD ME WERE CHERISHED MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER AND MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY OFTEN REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH HATRED
JOYCE POKED IN HER HEAD AND PEERED ABOUT
BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT CYNTHIA STOOD FIRM AND BOLDLY DECLARED
I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES
THEY WENT BEFORE HE DID PROBABLY
ALL DAY UP TO HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE SKY HAD BEEN CLOUDLESSLY BLUE THE DAY WARM AND RADIANT
AND I BELIEVE SHE HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE QUEER THINGS IN THIS HOUSE THAN ANY OF THOSE OTHER DEAD-AND-ALIVE PICTURE-LADIES
I SUPPOSE MRS COLLINGWOOD DIDN'T TELL ALL,--IN FACT I SAID SHE DIDN'T TELL ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
WE BEGAN IT AT FIRST JUST FOR FUN,--WE PRETENDED TO BE DETECTIVES
IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING UP I'LL GO MYSELF
WELL WHAT IS IT DEMANDED CYNTHIA IMPATIENTLY
WHAT'S ALL THIS FOOLISHNESS ANYWAY JOYCE SAW AT ONCE THAT SHE WAS GETTING AT NOTHING VERY DEFINITE ALONG THIS LINE AND DETERMINED ON A BOLD MOVE
THE RESULT OF THEIR RESEARCHES IN THE LIBRARY NEXT MORNING WAS NOT WHOLLY SATISFACTORY
THE REASON FOR THIS BEING THAT THE DOOR AT THE TOP WAS COVERED ON THE INNER SIDE WITH ONLY A LAYER OR TWO OF WALL-PAPER AND NO ARTICLE OF FURNITURE HAPPENED TO STAND IN FRONT OF IT
YOU'RE WRONG
WELL WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT CAN BE QUERIED CYNTHIA WELL WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT CAN BE QUERIED CYNTHIA
WELL TWO OR THREE BEGAN TO CHAFE HER HANDS AND FACE AND THE REST SENT THE SERVANTS FLYING FOR SMELLING-SALTS AND VINEGAR
YES I KNOW
ANYHOW IN THE DETECTIVE STORIES SHERLOCK HOLMES DIDN'T KEEP EVERYTHING SO QUIET BUT TALKED TO LOTS OF OUTSIDE PEOPLE AND GOT IDEAS THAT WAY TOO
OH CYNTHIA CRIED JOYCE
PERHAPS WE MIGHT JUST TRY TO PEEP BEHIND IT
MRS COLLINGWOOD STAYED AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE TWO DAYS CONTINUED JOYCE AND THEN LEFT FOR HER OLD HOME IN A LITTLE TOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEVER CAME NORTH AGAIN
THE LADIES HAD MET HIM WALKING UP FROM THE TRAIN
GOOD GRACIOUS
IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT I HEARD FATHER MENTION IT
HOW DID YOU EVER THINK ALL THAT OUT MURMURED CYNTHIA ADMIRINGLY
AN OPEN FIREPLACE SHOWED TRACES OF LETTERS HAVING BEEN TORN UP AND BURNED
BUT HE PROBABLY DIED VERY SOON AFTER AND EVIDENTLY FINDING MY NAME ON HIM IN THE CONFUSION IT WAS REPORTED THAT I WAS DEAD
YOU'D BETTER HURRY UP IF YOU'RE COMING BUT IT ISN'T RIGHT
BOTH GIRLS SPRANG TO THEIR FEET JOYCE EXCLAIMING INDIGNANTLY
OH WHY AM I SO FAT AND CLUMSY SHE MOANED
DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE JOYCE DEMANDED SUDDENLY THAT THERE'S NO SILVER HERE NO KNIVES FORKS SPOONS SUGAR-BOWLS OR--OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
AFTER THE BATTLE OF SHILOH A YEAR LATER WHEN THE PAPERS PUBLISHED THE LIST OF KILLED--FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD'S NAME WAS AMONG THE FIRST
HAVING FIRST DEPOSITED HER CANDLESTICK CAREFULLY ON THE TABLE
I SUPPOSE HE HADN'T USED IT MUCH AS HE WAS SO LITTLE AT HOME
SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON--ON FAIRFAX
HOW SHOULD I WHY CYNTHIA
AN OLD-FASHIONED SEWING-TABLE STOOD NEAR ONE WINDOW
NOW I'LL GO BACK TO MRS DURAND AND MRS COLLINGWOOD
WELL LET'S LET HIM STAY SINCE HE'S HERE SIGHED CYNTHIA WIPING HER EYES
WHY IT'S AN ADVENTURE CYNTHIA LIKE THE KIND WE'VE ALWAYS LONGED FOR
HE FEELS VERY MUCH AT HOME HERE FOR HE HAS COME IN WITH US OFTEN
ON EACH SIDE OF THE MAIN PART WAS A GENEROUS WING
CONSEQUENTLY IT HAD YIELDED WITH EASE AT THE TREMENDOUS SHOVE JOYCE HAD GIVEN IT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THUS FORCIBLY AND IGNOMINIOUSLY PROPELLED INTO THE APARTMENT
AND US IN THE MIDST OF IT CYNTHIA'S FIRST QUESTION THAT AFTERNOON ON THE WAY HOME FROM HIGH SCHOOL WAS
PARDON ME HE SAID
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL JOYCE I'D DONE IT BECAUSE--BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID SHE'D THINK I WAS MEDDLING IN WHAT DIDN'T CONCERN ME
MR
MERCY NO
MERCY NO
THE HOUSE ITSELF WAS A BIG RAMBLING AFFAIR OF THE COLONIAL TYPE WITH THREE TALL PILLARS SUPPORTING THE VERANDA ROOF AND REACHING ABOVE THE SECOND STORY
BUT UPON EXAMINATION THESE ALL PROVED TO BE OF EARLIER DATE THAN THAT OF THEIR FIRST DISCOVERY
TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT THERE WAS A RIPPING TEARING SOUND AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY PRONE UPON THE FLOOR OF THE MOST MYSTERIOUS ROOM IN THE HOUSE
FORTUNATELY SHE WAS CALLED AWAY FOR SOMETHING JUST THEN AND AFTERWARD DIDN'T THINK OF IT
PRESENTLY JOYCE GAVE UP TRYING TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION AND BEGAN TO READ THE PAPER IN REAL EARNEST,--A THING WHICH SHE SELDOM HAD THE TIME OR THE INTEREST TO DO
THESE ARE THE TINIEST LOWEST STAIRS I'VE EVER SEEN THEY CONTINUED TO CRAWL SLOWLY UP THEIR CANDLES FLICKERING LOW IN THE IMPOVERISHED AIR OF THE LONG-INCLOSED PLACE
YOU THINK THAT MUCH IS ALL RIGHT DON'T YOU CYNTHIA NODDED
WHAT EARTHLY HARM CAN IT DO
PRESENTLY JOYCE LAID DOWN THE VOLUME WITH A BIG SIGH
I KNEW OF NO OTHER OF THAT NAME AND THE TOWN WAS THE VERY ONE IN WHICH SHE LIVED
WELL WHO IS THE OLD LADY THAT YOU SPOKE OF ONCE WHO YOU SAID KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT QUEER OLD BOARDED-UP HOUSE NEXT DOOR NOW WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T YOU SAY SO AT ONCE WITHOUT FIRST MAKING ME GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF MY ELDERLY ACQUAINTANCES HE LAUGHED
AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE
AND EVEN IF IT DIDN'T LEAD TO ANYTHING AT LEAST IT WOULD BE GOOD FUN TO EXAMINE THEM
SHE USED TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY AND KNEW ALL THE BEST FAMILIES FOR MILES AROUND
WHEN CYNTHIA HAD ENDED THERE WAS A BIG LUMP IN JOYCE'S THROAT AND CYNTHIA HERSELF COUGHED AND FLOURISHED A HANDKERCHIEF ABOUT HER FACE WITH SUSPICIOUS OSTENTATION
I NOTICED THAT THEY MOST ALL HAD KEYS IN THE LOCKS
I WOULDN'T GO BACK NOW FOR WORLDS
AS TO THE OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS THEY WERE ALL TIGHTLY BOARDED UP
BUT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE DONE AND FEELING ON THE OTHER SIDE JOYCE DISCOVERED THAT IT HAD NO GLASS
IT ISN'T FAR TO THE GROUND
NOW I SEE
HE CAN'T BE DEAD

YOU DID KEEP ME WAITING AN AGE JOY CYNTHIA BEGAN STRUGGLING WITH A MOUTHFUL OF COOKY
PRUDENTLY HOWEVER SHE MADE NO REMARKS
AND EVIDENTLY THIS WAS ONE OF THEM JOYCE EYED HER CURIOUSLY
MY MOTHER NOW TELLS ME THAT SHE KNEW OF THIS MISTAKE AN ERROR OF THE NEW YORK PAPER IN COPYING THE ITEM FROM A SOUTHERN JOURNAL
THE BOY LOCKED IT AFTER HIM WHEN HE WENT AWAY AND TOOK THE KEY WITH HIM JOYCE REGARDED HER WITH SCORN
NOW ANNOUNCED JOYCE I KNOW
AND HE CAME THAT VERY AFTERNOON
I'M SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THINGS I CAN'T WAIT
RUN BACK TO YOUR HOUSE CYNTHIA AND SMUGGLE OUT A CANDLE AND A BOX OF MATCHES
PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE TIME TO PRACTISE THAT DUET AFTERWARD I WILL AGREED JOYCE AND SHE TURNED IN AT HER OWN GATE
OF COURSE I RAN THE CHANCE OF HIS NOT BEING THE RIGHT PERSON BUT I THOUGHT IF THAT WERE SO HE SIMPLY WOULDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE NOTE AND THE WHOLE THING WOULD END THERE
BREATHLESS FRANTIC THEY FELT THEIR WAY ALONG THE WALLS GROPING BLINDLY FOR THE ELUSIVE CELLAR DOOR
BUT SHE'LL HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT IT BY TO-MORROW MORNING
I WANT TO STAND RIGHT WHERE I CAN LOOK AT THE LOVELY LADY WHEN I TELL YOU THIS
LET'S PLAY WE'RE DETECTIVES LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES AND FERRET OUT THIS MYSTERY
J
I'VE THOUGHT OF THAT TOO BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD MUCH CHANCE TO DO IT TILL NOW
SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED IN FRONT OF HER COMPANION
RIGHT HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW
THEY FOUND THAT THE MOST RECENT FASHION OF HOOP-SKIRTS OR CRINOLINES HAD PREVAILED ALL THE WAY FROM 1840 TO 1870 OR THEREABOUTS
EXPLAIN IT ALL AND THEN SHOW ME WHAT YOU THINK WILL INTEREST ME SO
THEN SHE RELENTED
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
SHE WAS A SOUTHERNER HAVING COME ORIGINALLY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA
HERE'S WHERE GOLIATH DISAPPEARED WHISPERED JOYCE AND HE'S PROBABLY IN THERE NOW CYNTHIA SURVEYED THE HOLE UNCONCERNEDLY
IT'S OPEN THOUGH SHE BEGAN TO DUST THE TOP WHERE A ROW OF SCHOOL-BOOKS WERE ARRANGED AND PRESENTLY CAME TO THE WRITING-TABLET WHICH SHE WAS ABOUT TO POLISH OFF CONSCIENTIOUSLY
THAT WAS THE HOARSE SOUND THAT THEY HAD THOUGHT WAS HEAVY BREATHING
IT WAS SET WELL BACK FROM THE STREET IN A BIG INCLOSURE GUARDED BY A VERY RICKETY PICKET-FENCE AND A GATE THAT WAS NEVER SHUT BUT HUNG LOOSELY ON ONE HINGE
WE'VE LEFT ENOUGH OF OUR THINGS AROUND FOR THAT
THEN THEY TORE AT THE MOULDY SHREDS OF WALL-PAPER TILL THE ENTIRE FRAME OF THE PANELED WOODEN DOORWAY WAS FREE
AN OPEN WORK-BOX HELD DUST-COVERED SPOOLS
DRESSES HATS WAISTS SHE ENUMERATED
I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAPPENED TO REMEMBER THIS
WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS
I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES
NO THERE WASN'T ANY MURDER OR ANYTHING BLOODTHIRSTY AT ALL
SO THEY HAD IT ALL PAPERED OVER AND JUST PUT THE SHELVES IN FRONT OF IT AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN THERE
I JUST HAD TO PULL YOU IN AND YOU DISPUTED EVERY INCH OF THE WAY THAT'S THE WAY WITH ME RETURNED CYNTHIA
SHE LOOKS VERY YOUNG NOT NEARLY OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE A SON OR DAUGHTER WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING VERY DREADFUL SO WE'LL COUNT THEM OUT
I SUPPOSE WE CAN'T JUDGE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FELT IN THOSE DAYS
BUT OH CYNTHIA WILL WE EVER KNOW ABOUT THE LOCKED-UP ROOM AS CYNTHIA COULD CAST NO FURTHER LIGHT ON THIS VEXED QUESTION THEY WERE FORCED TO DROP IT
AND FIND THIS GOING ON BUT CYNTHIA WAS NOT LISTENING TO JOYCE
I CERTAINLY DID AND WHAT A STUPID I AM NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF IT SINCE AND SHE HERSELF STOPPED SHORT AND STOOD THINKING
YOU SEE THE PAPER HAS FALLEN AWAY PROBABLY THROUGH DAMPNESS,--AND THE MICE SEEM TO HAVE EATEN IT TOO
DID YOU HEAR THAT SHE WHISPERED
AND DURING THE LAST YEAR I WAS THERE I MADE THE THIRD AND FINAL TRIAL AND WHEN AGAIN NO ANSWER CAME I FELT THAT IT WAS BEYOND ALL HOPE TO EXPECT FORGIVENESS SINCE SHE COULD IGNORE THREE SUCH URGENT APPEALS
BUT ISN'T HE HANDSOME
CYNTHIA THIS IS THE STRANGEST THING I EVER HEARD OF CYNTHIA ONLY STARED AND OFFERED NO EXPLANATION
IF SHE COULD ONLY VISIT HER AND GET HER TO TALK ABOUT IT
THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
NOT A WORD WAS SAID IN REFERENCE TO IT BY EITHER BUT CYNTHIA NOTICED JOYCE LOOKING AT HER RATHER CURIOUSLY SEVERAL TIMES
OF WHOM SHOULD I MAKE INQUIRIES
IT TOOK HIM A MONTH TO MAKE THE JOURNEY THERE AND BACK
ON THE CONTRARY ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS IN THE WILDERNESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY IN MY THOUGHTS
TRIED TO FIND OUT ONCE
AND WON'T YOU TAKE ME I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN TWO YEARS HE MUSED
I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK ME THOROUGHLY INHOSPITABLE IF I GO TO MY ROOM FOR A WHILE THEY ALL TOLD HER SHE MUST CERTAINLY GO AND LIE DOWN AND THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE IMMEDIATELY
LET'S COMMENCE WITH GEOMETRY SHE SUGGESTED OPENING THE TEXT-BOOK
THEN A REAL TERROR OF THE DARK UNKNOWN SPACES FILLED THEM BOTH
YES THERE WAS A SOUND A STRANGE INDEFINABLE ONE LIKE A SOFT TIPTOEING AT LONG INTERVALS AND EVEN A CURIOUS HOARSE BREATHING
BUT THE ATTIC HAD NO GREAT HOLDING INTEREST AT PRESENT SINCE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT CONTAINED NO CLUE TO HELP THEM IN THE SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY
BUT MY SECOND THOUGHT WAS TO LET IT PASS AFTER ALL
LET'S LOOK IN THE ONE ACROSS THE HALL THIS ONE ALSO PROVED PRECISELY SIMILAR BED UNTOUCHED AND FURNITURE UNDISTURBED
THEN WITH ONE ACCORD THEY BEGAN TO STEER THEIR WAY AROUND THE FURNITURE OH DON'T WORRY ADDED THE PRACTICAL CYNTHIA
HERE WE ARE AT PROPOSITION XVI ALL RIGHT ASSENTED JOYCE WITH DECEPTIVE SWEETNESS
AND THAT THEY SHOULD MEET HERE JUST THIS AFTERNOON
THEY ALL CAME OUT BY TRAIN AND DROVE HERE IN HIRED CARRIAGES FROM THE STATION WHICH WAS A LONG WAY OFF THEN
THAT PERSON MUST HAVE BEEN SOME NEAR AND DEAR RELATION OF THE LOVELY LADY'S SURELY
SHE FULLY EXPECTED TO SEE A MAN STRIDE IN--MORE LIKELY HALF A DOZEN!--AND DEMAND THE MEANING OF THE UNWARRANTABLE INTRUSION AND ILLUMINATION
WELL I HAPPENED TO BE GLANCING OVER THE NEWS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAD JUST LANDED HERE FROM ABROAD WHEN A LITTLE PARAGRAPH CAUGHT MY EYE
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE IN THE ROOM BROKEN ONLY BY THE SCRATCH OF CYNTHIA'S PENCIL OR THE RUSTLING OF A TURNED PAGE
THEN JOYCE BEGAN
YOU'VE GOT THE SENSE CYNTHIA
THAT'S WHERE I'VE BEEN LONGING TO GET
PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE--ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE-TIED WITH PERPLEXITY
WHICH WAY SHOULD I TURN
OH CYNTHIA
OH CYNTHIA
HERE THEY ARE--THE LOVELY LADY AND HER BOY
WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS
WAR FORMALLY DECLARED
STOP STOP JOYCE
JUST A--JUST A FRIEND SHE EXPLAINED
NOT HERE SHE ANSWERED
IT WAS AS JOYCE HAD GUESSED A LIBRARY
I SIGNED MY NAME RIGHT OUT BECAUSE FATHER HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT TO WRITE AN ANONYMOUS LETTER WAS THE MOST DESPICABLE THING ANY ONE COULD DO
THAT WAS LIKE JOYCE
BUT STILL I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT
I'M NOT QUICK ABOUT GOING INTO THINGS BUT ONCE I'M IN YOU CAN'T GET ME OUT
AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER
LATER GREAT-AUNT LUCIA DISCOVERED THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW LIVING OUT HERE
AT LAST WHEN HE WOULDN'T GIVE IN SHE ADMITTED TO MRS DURAND THAT SHE DISOWNED HIM AND TOLD HIM NEVER TO SEE HER FACE AGAIN
AND THEY HAD SLIPPED OUT INTO THE HALL UNOBSERVED IN ORDER THAT THE TWO IN THE DRAWING-ROOM MIGHT HAVE THIS WONDERFUL MOMENT TO THEMSELVES
POSSIBLY HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SHUT UP THE HOUSE AND LEAVE IT FOREVER
THE FOURTH SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS PRACTICALLY DEVOTED TO ANOTHER HUGE FIREPLACE AND OVER THE MANTEL HUNG ANOTHER PORTRAIT
I SUPPOSED OF COURSE THAT HE'D GO PILING RIGHT DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA TO FIND HIS MOTHER OR SEE WHETHER SHE WAS ALIVE
LET'S LOOK ABOUT A LITTLE
IN THE YEAR THAT HAD ELAPSED I HAD NEVER CEASED TO HOPE THAT THE NOTE I LEFT WOULD SOFTEN MY MOTHER'S FEELINGS TOWARD ME AND THAT AT LEAST SHE WOULD SEND ME WORD THAT I WAS FORGIVEN
SHE WAS STRAINING HER EARS IN ANOTHER DIRECTION
WITH THE GOLD BACK PRESSED INWARD IT SLID INTO PLACE LEAVING NO SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT IT HAD ORIGINALLY FORMED PART OF THIS TRINKET
WE CAN'T QUITE REALIZE IT NOW AND SHOULDN'T JUDGE THEM FOR THE WAY THEY ACTED
BUT A LONG END SOON WORKED OUT AND TRAILED BEHIND HER UNNOTICED TILL GOLIATH BASKING ON THE VERANDA STEPS SPIED IT
A PAIR OF FENCING-FOILS HUNG CROSSED ON ONE WALL A COUPLE OF BOXING-GLOVES ON ANOTHER
PERHAPS WE COULD GET MORE CANDLES BY THAT TIME TOO
CAN'T YOU SEE
IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE SEEMS TO ME TO COME BACK TO A DARK DESERTED HOUSE THAT YOU'D LEFT SO LONG AGO AND NOBODY HERE TO--TO WELCOME YOU
BUT HERE'S WHERE THE AWFUL THING COMES IN
ONLY THIRTY CENTS
THEY WERE STILL RATHER ANXIOUS ON THE SUBJECT OF MEDDLING AND TRESPASSING BUT THEY DID NOT TRY TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES RECOUNTING THE ADVENTURES SIMPLY AND HIDING NOTHING
SUDDENLY JOYCE STRAIGHTENED UP AND LOOKED CYNTHIA SQUARELY IN THE EYES
THEN THE NEWCOMER SPOKE
WOULD IT NOT APPEAR AS THOUGH I WERE ANXIOUS FOR A RECONCILIATION BECAUSE I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE THE PROPERTY WHICH WOULD ONE DAY HAVE BEEN MINE HAD NOT MY MOTHER DISINHERITED ME
AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL,--NEED I SAY IT?--FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE,--GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS,--BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
AS PLAIN AS PRINT ONE COULD READ THE SIGNS OF SOME FEASTING PARTY INTERRUPTED AND GUESTS HASTILY LEAVING THEIR PLACES TO RETURN NO MORE
AND AT LAST THE INTERVENING TREES SHUT THEM FROM SIGHT
SHE HAD EXPECTED RESISTANCE AND PREPARED TO COPE WITH IT
A HEAVY CHAIR WAS STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH WITH ITS BACK TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN ONCE A CHEERY BLAZE
THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK
IT'S NOT SO EASY AFTER GOODNESS KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS
NOW WHAT THEY HAD EXPECTED TO FIND WITHIN THAT MYSTERIOUS ROOM THEY COULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE EXPLAINED WITH ANY DEFINITENESS
YOU WILL FIND IT ALL LIT UP THERE
LET'S GO RIGHT AWAY FULL OF NEW ENTHUSIASM THEY SCRAMBLED TO THEIR FEET APPROACHED THE CELLAR WINDOW BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE OBSERVED IN THIS AND WERE SOON IN THE DIM CELLAR LIGHTING THEIR CANDLES
THEN LATER WHEN THEY'D MADE IT ALL UP PROVIDED SHE WAS ALIVE WHICH EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW THEN I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT COME BACK HERE AND OPEN THE HOUSE
IT'S UP THESE STAIRS IN THE ROOM ABOVE--ON THE DESK SHE SAID
BUT WE'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW IF YOU CARE TO HEAR A LIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO DAWN ON THE BEWILDERED JOYCE
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY THEORY CYNTHIA WHY I THINK IT IS ALL RIGHT FINE--AS FAR AS IT GOES
SHE HAD MARRIED A NORTHERN MAN AND HAD LIVED EVER SINCE UP HERE BUT THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
BY THE WAY CYN WHY WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD IDEA TO WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK BEFORE WE HAVE OUR ILLUMINATION
BUT NOT FOR LONG
I WISH I WERE AS QUICK AS YOU NEVER MIND
NOW WHAT WAS THE SENSE OF IT,--TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING
OF COURSE I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TOO SO I'LL GO HALVES WITH YOU ON THE EXPENSE
THERE SEEMED TO BE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE
THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO HASTEN CYNTHIA WHO USUALLY LOVED TO LINGER COZILY OVER HER MORNING MEAL
THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY
THEN TO THEIR ASTONISHMENT SHE TURNED FIRST A FIERY RED AND AFTERWARD WHITE AS A SHEET
HE WRITES A NOTE THAT HE IS HOPING WITH ALL HIS HEART THAT HIS MOTHER WILL SEE
AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WAS A VERY DISTANT COUSIN OF HERS WHO HAD DIED A MRS FANSHAWE COLLINGWOOD WHO ALSO LIVED IN THE TOWN
I'M VERY TIRED--AND VERY VERY--BEWILDERED SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SOFA AND DREW EACH OF THE GIRLS DOWN BESIDE HER
SHE ONLY SAID SHE KNEW THEM AND THEY'D GONE AWAY RATHER SUDDENLY AND LEFT THEIR HOUSE ALL FURNISHED AND NEVER CAME BACK
CYNTHIA WE HAVE THE DIMMEST LIGHT HERE WITH ONLY THOSE TWO CANDLES
WHAT NONSENSE I HAVE TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF
MY SHE GASPED SITTING UP AND DUSTING HER HANDS BUT THAT WAS SUDDEN
DESPITE THE ROLLS OF DUST THAT LAY ABOUT JOYCE CRAWLED UNDER AND RESCUED IT
PRESENTLY THEY CAME ABREAST OF THE GREAT OPEN FIREPLACE
MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE
JOYCE TOOK UP THE DISK AND FITTED IT INTO ONE SIDE
BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO DO
SUDDENLY JOYCE LOOKED UP
WE CAN EASILY BALANCE IT ON THE MANTEL WITH INFINITE CAUTION AND SOME THREATENED MISHAPS THEY FINALLY GOT IT INTO POSITION RIGHT SIDE TO THE FRONT AND SPRANG DOWN TO GET THEIR CANDLES
WE'LL DO IT AGAIN ANOTHER TIME
CYNTHIA WAS RIGHT
OF COURSE THAT WOULD BREAK UP THE PARTY AT ONCE
AND NOW WILL YOU--WILL YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU SPOKE OF CYNTHIA ROSE HANDED HER A LIGHTED CANDLE AND LED HER TO THE OPENING OF THE LITTLE STAIRWAY IN THE LIBRARY
WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT THE TWO GIRLS GAVE A SIMULTANEOUS GASP OF DISMAY
YET EVERYTHING ELSE IN CHINA OR GLASS IS LEFT
SMUGGLING THE HOUSE-CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK-BROOM AND DUST-PAN TO THE OUTFIT
WHY WEREN'T THINGS CLEARED UP AND PUT AWAY
YOU CAN SEE EVEN THERE WHAT A FINE YOUNG FELLOW HE MUST HAVE MADE WITH THOSE BIG BROWN EYES AND THAT CURLY GOLDEN HAIR
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
AT THE TOP WAS A SHUT DOOR WHICH REFUSED TO BE MOVED AND THEY FEARED FOR A MOMENT THAT FAILURE AWAITED THEM IN THIS EARLY PERIOD OF THE VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY
FOR THE MATTER OF THAT IT HAD STARED THE TWO GIRLS OUT OF COUNTENANCE EVER SINCE THEY CAME TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF ROCKRIDGE ONE ON EACH SIDE OF IT
BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY
JOYCE GIGGLED AT ITS SHORN APPEARANCE AND THEN RELAPSED INTO ANOTHER LONG SILENCE
AT LENGTH JOYCE'S HAND STRUCK A KNOB
BUT THE DOOR RESISTED AND CYNTHIA WAS JUST UTTERING THE DESPAIRING CRY OH IT'S LOCKED TOO WHEN IT SUDDENLY GAVE WAY WITH A WHOLLY UNEXPECTED JERK AND FLEW OPEN EMITTING A CLOUD OF DUST
WHAT WILL THEY THINK CRIED JOYCE
THERE ARE ONLY THREE LEFT SHE CRIED FEELING ROUND IN IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS IT'S EASY TO GUESS I WASN'T KILLED AT THE BATTLE OF SHILOH AT ALL,--BUT SO VERY SERIOUSLY WOUNDED--THAT I CAME TO BE SO REPORTED
I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN
IF SO LET THE PICTURE DOWN GENTLY TO REST ON THE MANTEL
COME SHE ORDERED
ONLY THE OLD THING HAS BEEN LEFT SO LONG AND THERE'S SUCH A MYSTERY ABOUT IT AND WE'RE NOT HARMING OR DISTURBING ANYTHING THAT PERHAPS IT ISN'T SO DREADFUL
THEY STARED WITH THE FASCINATION OF HORROR AS THEY STARED WITH THE FASCINATION OF HORROR THE PARTIALLY OPEN DOOR WAS PUSHED FARTHER OPEN AND A DIM GRAY FORM GLIDED AROUND ITS EDGE
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT JOYCE I'M GOING TO TAKE ALONG A DUST-CLOTH AND CLEAN UP AROUND THE WINDOW WHERE WE GET IN
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ALL GOING TO SUSPECT THAT WE'RE INSIDE HERE EVERY OTHER DAY JUST BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO SPEAK OF THE PLACE
I'M WILD,--SIMPLY WILD WITH IMPATIENCE TO SEE IT ALL THE SEARCH FOR THE KEY WAS NOT EXACTLY SYSTEMATIC
BUT I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND ALL--ALL THIS SHE GLANCED TOWARD THE BURNING CANDLES
I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT IT
LET'S GO TO HIS OFFICE AND ASK HIM ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE
JOYCE SHE KNEW WOULD EXPLAIN ALL MYSTERIES LATER AND SHE WAS CONTENT TO WAIT
I'M SO GLAD I DID IT CYNTHIA TURNED ON HER
I'M AFRAID OF THEM NONSENSE
IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT
WHAT A STRANGE THING IT IS,--THIS SECRET STAIRWAY SHE MARVELED ALOUD
THE OCCUPANTS OF THE ROOM HAD BEEN TOO ABSORBED WITH THEIR OWN AFFAIRS TO NOTICE THE GRADUAL DIMMING OF THE ILLUMINATION
AND THEN THIS EXPLANATION DAWNED ON ME,--HE HAD LEFT THAT NOTE FOR HIS MOTHER AND PERHAPS THOUGHT THAT IF SHE REALLY INTENDED TO FORGIVE HIM SHE'D HAVE MADE SOME EFFORT TO GET WORD TO HIM IN THE YEAR THAT ELAPSED BEFORE HE WAS REPORTED KILLED
LET'S SEE
I'M JUST DOG-TIRED ALL RIGHT ASSENTED CYNTHIA IN MUFFLED TONES HER HEAD BEING UNDER A GREAT DESK IN THE CORNER
NOW WHAT ASKED CYNTHIA
WELL WHEN SHE CAME TO AND EVERY ONE HAD GONE SHE WAS WILD FRANTIC WITH GRIEF OR DISAPPOINTMENT OR DISGUST AND DECIDED SHE JUST COULDN'T STAY IN THAT HOUSE ANY LONGER
EVERYWHERE A HASTY DEPARTURE WAS INDICATED SO HASTY AS JOYCE REMARKED THAT THE LADY DECIDED PROBABLY NOT TO TAKE HER TRUNKS AFTER ALL BUT LEFT VERY LIKELY WITH ONLY A HAND-BAG AND NOW CRIED JOYCE THE IRREPRESSIBLE WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING IN THIS ROOM
I'M ALMOST CERTAIN I HEARD A SOUND IN THE OTHER ROOM THEY BOTH FELL TO LISTENING INTENTLY
ARMED AS THEY WERE WITH PLENTY OF CANDLES AND MATCHES THERE WERE NO SHUDDERS EITHER OR FEARS OF THE UNKNOWN AND THE DARK
JOYCE GLANCED AT THE BIG HANGING CANDELABRUM AND SIGHED WITH WEARINESS
IN A MOMENT SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND CALLED IN A LOW VOICE
WE'LL GO TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO-MORROW AND GET OUT A BIG BOOK ON COSTUMES OF THE DIFFERENT CENTURIES THAT I SAW THERE ONCE
WELL A FEW
HERE STUFF THEM INTO YOUR POCKETS
I COULDN'T HELP IT FOR I DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT IT WAS AT FIRST
IT WAS YELLOW WITH AGE AND COVERED WITH WRITING IN FADED INK,--WRITING IN A BIG ROUND BOYISH HAND
PSHAW
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS REFUSED TO BE SEPARATED FROM YOUR PRECIOUS CYNTHIA AND I COULDN'T THINK OF INFLICTING TWO YOUNGSTERS ON HER JOYCE REMEMBERED NOW WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SELF-REPROACH HOW MANY TIMES SHE HAD BEGGED OFF FROM ACCOMPANYING HER FATHER
THE ROOM WAS IN PERFECT ORDER
WHY!--THEY'RE CALLED PUNCH
THOUGH IN EVIDENT DISARRAY IT HOWEVER EXHIBITED FEWER SIGNS OF THE STRANGE LONG-PAST AGITATION
YOU DON'T TURN THE DEAD RELATIVE'S PICTURE TO THE WALL OR TEAR IT OUT OF YOUR LOCKET AND THROW IT INTO THE FIRE
THIS HOWEVER WAS OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY SOLUTION AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER HOW IT COULD BE ARRANGED
IT'S THE VERY ONE THAT HANGS ABOUT THE NECK OF OUR LOVELY LADY IN THE PICTURE DOWN-STAIRS IT WAS INDEED NO OTHER
AND WE FELT YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT,--AT LEAST I FELT THAT WAY AND SO I WROTE YOU THE LETTER
BUT AS IT WENT ON WE GOT MORE AND MORE DEEPLY INTERESTED TILL AT LAST THIS--THIS ALL SEEMED MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR OWN LIVES ENDED JOYCE
AND THEN THERE'S ALL UP-STAIRS WHAT I WANT TO SEE MOST OF ALL IS THE PICTURE YOU SPOKE OF THAT HANGS IN THE PARLOR SAID CYNTHIA
ON A CENTER-TABLE STOOD A PHOTOGRAPH OR DAGUERREOTYPE IN A LARGE OVAL FRAME
SOMEBODY WAS VISITING US WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE AND ASKED HIM AT THE TABLE ABOUT THE OLD HOUSE NEXT DOOR
THEN WITH A FIRM MOVEMENT SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND IN THE SOFT LIGHT OF THE CANDLES STOOD REVEALED
JOYCE AND CYNTHIA WERE HEALTHY NORMAL GIRLS FULL OF INTERESTS CONNECTED WITH THEIR SCHOOL WITH OUTDOOR AFFAIRS AND WITH SOCIAL LIFE SO THEY HAD MUCH TO OCCUPY THEM BESIDE THIS CURIOUS QUEST ON WHICH THEY HAD BECOME ENGAGED
IT ISN'T A KEY BUT WHAT'S THAT ROUND THING JOYCE HAD SEEN IT AT THE SAME MOMENT AND PICKED IT UP--A SMALL ELLIPTICAL DISK SO BLACKENED WITH SOOT THAT NOTHING COULD BE MADE OF IT TILL IT WAS WIPED OFF
NOW THOUGH THE SUM SEEMS SMALL TO US IT WAS LARGE TO HIM
OH PLEASE BEGAN JOYCE BREATHLESSLY WON'T YOU TELL US MR COLLINGWOOD HOW YOU COME TO BE--_NOT DEAD!_--AND WHY YOU GAVE ANOTHER NAME AT THE DOOR--AND--AND HE LAUGHED
SHE PUSHED THE BOOKS ASIDE
EVERYONE JUMPED UP TOO SOME SO QUICKLY THAT THEY KNOCKED OVER THEIR CHAIRS AND ASKED IF ANYTHING DREADFUL WAS THE MATTER
THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE
A SERVANT CAME IN AND HANDED MRS COLLINGWOOD A TELEGRAM AS SHE SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
EVEN THE NARROW BLACK VELVET RIBBON WAS IDENTICAL
IT TOOK NO GREAT STRETCH OF IMAGINATION TO CONJECTURE WHAT THEY WERE--TWINS--AND EVIDENTLY BROTHER AND SISTER FOR ONE YOUNGSTER'S DRESS BEING A TRIFLE SEVERE IN STYLE INDICATED THAT IT WAS DOUBTLESS A BOY
WE MUST TURN IT AROUND AS IT RESTS HERE
YOU KNOW IT'S NEAR THE END OF THE MONTH AND I'M DOWN TO FIFTEEN CENTS AGAIN AND I GUESS YOU AREN'T MUCH BETTER OFF
HIS FOOTFALLS TOO COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD WHEN ALL ELSE WAS QUIET AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY RUBBED AGAINST SOME LIGHT ARTICLE OF FURNITURE IN THE OUTER ROOM AND MOVED IT
I'VE HAD BAD NEWS DEAR FRIENDS AND IT HAS MADE ME FEEL QUITE ILL
HURRAH FOR HOUSE-CLEANING THIS AFTERNOON FILLED WITH FRESH ENTHUSIASM THE TWO GIRLS RUSHED OUT TO HURRY THROUGH THE NECESSARY STUDIES BEFORE THE ANTICIPATED PICNIC OF THE AFTERNOON
BUT THE DINING-ROOM'S DIFFERENT
THEN AFTER A MOMENT BATES'S PUP EMERGED ONE EAR COMICALLY COCKED AND AMBLED AWAY IN SEARCH OF OTHER ENTERTAINMENT
THERE WASN'T ANY TOWN OF ROCKRIDGE YOU KNOW TILL JUST RECENTLY,--ONLY THE TURNPIKE ROAD OFF THERE WHERE WARRINGTON AVENUE IS NOW
GOOD DAY SIR AND THE TWO GIRLS FLED PRECIPITATELY FROM THE OFFICE
COLLEGE TROPHIES DECORATED THE MANTEL
CHAPTER VII GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY OH CYNTHIA GASPED JOY AT LENGTH ISN'T IT TOO COMICAL
WHY JUST GO IN THERE AND TURN THAT PICTURE IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AROUND OH CYNTHIA YOU JEWEL
CYNTHIA HOW COULD HE BEAR TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND
THE ONLY ROOM IN THE HOUSE THAT WE CAN'T GET IN AND THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL I'M CERTAIN
THIS HAS GOT TO BE KEPT A STRICT SECRET
JOYCE WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE CHIMNEY-PLACE
IT CAME TO ME ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOUR SON FAIRFAX
I CAME OFTEN
THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE-LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
THERE'S THE WING OFF THE PARLOR TOWARD YOUR HOUSE AND THE ONE OFF THE DINING-ROOM TOWARD MINE
AND I THINK THAT--YOU WOULD RATHER GO--ALONE MRS COLLINGWOOD TOOK THE CANDLE AND CYNTHIA HELPED HER INTO THE OPENING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
YOU KNOW CYNTHIA I REALIZE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING A LITTLE QUEER BEING IN THIS HOUSE AND PRYING ABOUT
YOU'RE ENGINEERING THIS BUSINESS WELL I WILL CONCEDED JOYCE NOT VERY HOPEFULLY HOWEVER
THEN SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET SAYING OH IN A SORT OF STIFLED VOICE
THIS TOOK PLACE YEARS AND YEARS AGO
BUT APART FROM THIS FURTHER INDICATION OF THE HASTE WITH WHICH A MEAL HAD BEEN ABANDONED UNFINISHED THERE WAS LITTLE TO HOLD THE INTEREST AND THE GIRLS SOON TURNED AWAY
FOR MONTH ON MONTH I WOULD SEE NO HUMAN BEING SAVE THE HALF-BREED INDIAN GUIDE WHO ACCOMPANIED ME AND MOST OF THE TIME HE SEEMED TO ME SCARCELY HUMAN
THERE HAD BEEN A LIVELY DEBATE AND JOYCE AND CYNTHIA AS TWO OF THE OPPONENTS HAD JUST FINISHED ROUNDLY AND WORDILY BELABORING EACH OTHER
SHE BEGGED THEM NOT TO HURRY BUT OF COURSE THEY SAW THAT IT WASN'T BEST TO STAY SINCE SHE WOULDN'T LET THEM DO ANYTHING FOR HER
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SILK CORD IT'S HANGING BY MAY BE AWFULLY ROTTEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS AND IF WE TOUCH IT THE WHOLE THING MAY FALL
AND HE'S BEEN SUCH A HELP HE'S A BETTER DETECTIVE THAN ANY OF US BLESSINGS ON GOLIATH THEN SAY I LAUGHED MR FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD AND APPROACHING THE HUGE FELINE WITH COAXING WORDS HE GATHERED ITS UNRESISTING FORM IN HIS ARMS AND DEPOSITED THE WARM FURRY PURRING BEAST IN HIS MOTHER'S LAP
DO COME BACK BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN A QUARTER OF IT YET
EVERY ONE JUMPED UP FROM THE TABLE UPSETTING CHAIRS AND DROPPING NAPKINS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT'S OVER THERE THEY TURNED AND RETRACED THEIR STEPS EMERGING FROM THE SERVANTS QUARTERS AND PASSING AGAIN THE ROOMS THEY HAD ALREADY EXAMINED
YES A SON
THERE WAS NO ESCAPE
WHY NOT DO IT THIS AFTERNOON JUST THE THING AGREED JOYCE
THAT EVENING WHEN SHE AND HER FATHER WERE SEATED COZILY IN THE LIBRARY SHE STUDYING HER FATHER SMOKING AND READING HIS PAPER WHILE HER MOTHER WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF THE ROOM SHE BEGAN DIPLOMATICALLY
AND SUPPOSE WE DO A LITTLE DUSTING AND CLEANING UP IN THE MORNING AND FIX THE CANDLES IN THE CANDELABRUM AND IN THE AFTERNOON LIGHT THEM UP AND HAVE THE FUN OF WATCHING THEM JOYCE AGREED TO THIS HEARTILY AND THEY TURNED INTO A STORE TO PURCHASE THE CANDLES
I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL SURE IT WOULD EVER REACH YOU
THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO
I SHIPPED FOR A VOYAGE TO JAPAN AND CHINA AND SPENT SEVERAL MORE YEARS TRYING TO PENETRATE THE FORBIDDEN FASTNESSES OF TIBET
AND SEE HOW PROUDLY SHE LOOKS AT HIM
OH WAIT WAIT
HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN DEAD A NUMBER OF YEARS,--TEN I THINK
SHE WAS PROBABLY TOO UPSET AND HURRIED TO THINK OF IT AGAIN
HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT
JOYCE CAME OVER THAT EVENING BRINGING HER BOOKS AND MUSIC
CHAPTER IX THE MEMORIES OF GREAT-AUNT LUCIA CYNTHIA SAT AT HER DESK IN HIGH SCHOOL ALTERNATELY STARING OUT OF THE WINDOW GAZING INTENTLY ACROSS THE ROOM AT JOYCE AND SCOWLING AT THE BLACKBOARD WHERE THE CRYPTIC SYMBOLS A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2 WERE BEING LABORIOUSLY EXPOUNDED BY THE PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS
I'M GOING TO MEET WHOEVER IT IS AND TELL THEM WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY REAL HARM,--AND SO MUST YOU ALL DURING THIS SPEECH THEY COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF SOME ONE WORKING AT THE LOCK OF THE MAIN DOOR
LAST NIGHT AN IDEA CAME TO ME JUST THROUGH SOME REMARK THAT FATHER HAPPENED TO MAKE
NOW YOU MUSTN'T BE CROSS CYNTHIA
WHEN THE LITTLE TOWN OF ROCKRIDGE BEGAN TO BUILD UP PEOPLE SPECULATED ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
AND THE FASCINATION OF IT WAS THAT THOUGH THEY NOW KNEW SO MUCH THEY DID NOT YET KNOW ALL
BY THIS TIME FIFTEEN YEARS HAD PASSED
BEFORE I LEFT CALIFORNIA FOR CANADA THE WAR WAS THEN OVER SOME FOUR OR FIVE YEARS I HAD CONTEMPLATED WRITING TO HER INFORMING HER OF THE MISTAKE ABOUT MY DEATH AND BEGGING HER ONCE MORE TO FORGIVE ME
COME ON THEY WANDERED DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE LAWN THROUGH THE GAP IN THE FENCE AND TRIED TO PART THE BUSHES BEHIND WHICH GOLIATH HAD DISAPPEARED
SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MRS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA
OF COURSE IT WILL BE THE EASIEST WAY
GIVE ME A PENCIL AND PAPER PLEASE CYNTHIA HANDED THEM TO HER AND BEGAN
SO STRONG DID THIS CONVICTION BECOME THAT I DECIDED TO COME NORTH MYSELF AND PERSONALLY SUPERINTEND PUTTING THE HOUSE IN ORDER
OH HOW QUEER AND OLD-FASHIONED THEY ALL SEEM SUDDENLY WITH A LITTLE CRY OF TRIUMPH SHE LEANED OVER AND PARTIALLY PULLED OUT AN ELABORATE SILK DRESS
WHEN ARE YOU GOING AGAIN
IT BEGAN MY DEAREST MOTHER CYNTHIA DREW BACK WITH A JERK SCRUPULOUSLY HONORABLE AS USUAL
THE MORE I THOUGHT IT OVER THE MORE I BECAME CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS THE WISEST COURSE
OH THE POOR MOTHER HOW SHE MUST HAVE GRIEVED ALL THESE YEARS
WHICH OF YOU TWO FRIENDS WAS IT MAY I ASK WHO SENT ME THE LETTER HER VOICE WAS SWEET AND LOW AND SOFT AND AS SAD AS HER EYES
EVEN THE PLACID AND HITHERTO OBJECTING CYNTHIA WAS FIRED BY THE SCHEME
PROBABLY AS SOON AS WE TOUCH THE PICTURE THE CORD WILL BREAK
WE CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THAT ROOM
THIS CANDLE WILL SOON BE DONE FOR SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED THE PRACTICAL CYNTHIA
DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO GO UP ASKED CYNTHIA ANXIOUSLY
A KIND OF AWE HAD FALLEN UPON THEM
SO FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY WERE ALL DRIVING AWAY IN THE CARRIAGES WHICH HAD REMAINED FOR THEM AT THE HOUSE
SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT WELL SINCE YOU DON'T LIKE MY THEORY REPLIED CYNTHIA STILL NETTLED WHAT'S YOURS
HE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT TWELVE THEN
I NEVER COULD HAVE PIECED THINGS TOGETHER IN THAT WAY
SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE CHANGE THAT THEY ALL SAT VERY STILL
IT WAS A HORRIBLE POSITION
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WONDERFUL HERE AND THE AIR IS SIMPLY HORRID
YOU ALWAYS LIKE THAT
THEY WONDERED NERVOUSLY WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY
ON THE UPPER FLOOR THEY FOUND A WIDE HALL CORRESPONDING WITH THE ONE BELOW RUNNING FROM FRONT TO BACK CROSSED BY A NARROWER ONE CONNECTING THE WINGS WITH THE MAIN PART OF THE HOUSE
COME LET'S GO HOME NOW
GOLIATH WAS UNDER THE BED DABBING GRACEFULLY WITH ONE PAW AT SOMETHING ATTACHED TO A STRING OR NARROW RIBBON
I NOTICE FOLKS ARE LIABLE TO TALK QUITE A LONG WHILE ON MOST ANY SUBJECT THAT'S STARTED
SO THAT'S THE EXPLANATION OF THE TWO BABIES IN THE OTHER ROOM
PRESENTLY JOYCE REMARKED IDLY
WHAT A GOOD GUESSER YOU ARE SAID JOYCE WITHERINGLY
THAT ONE WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT BUT IT ISN'T HARD TO GUESS THAT IT WAS THE PERSON WHOSE PICTURE IS TURNED TO THE WALL AND WHOSE MINIATURE WAS IN THE LOCKET AND WHO PROBABLY OCCUPIED THE LOCKED-UP ROOM
PARENTS AREN'T LIABLE TO CAUSE THAT KIND OF TROUBLE SO WE'LL COUNT THEM OUT
I CAN'T HOLD IT ANY LONGER AND WITH A THUD THE HEAVY BURDEN SLIPPED TO THE MANTEL
WHEN THEY RETURNED THAT AFTERNOON CYNTHIA HAD SMUGGLED OVER THE GAS-LIGHTER WHICH THEY FOUND A BOON INDEED IN LIGHTING SO MANY CANDLES AT SUCH A HEIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE B
YOU WANT TO DO SUCH QUEER THINGS I DON'T SEE ANYTHING QUEER ABOUT THAT RETORTED CYNTHIA BLUSHING HOTLY
THEN CAME SPRING AND THE ANCIENT CHERRY-TREES IN THE ENCLOSURE BACK OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE BLOSSOMED ANEW
AT LAST HOWEVER SHE CAME TO THEM AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BETWEEN THEM ON THE SOFA
THEY ARE MUCH TOO DISTANT
THEY EXPERIENCED A DELICIOUS THRILL OF EXPECTATION AS WITH THEIR CANDLES RAISED ABOVE THEIR HEADS THEY PEERED EAGERLY ABOUT
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE KINDER TO HER TO ALLOW HER TO THINK I WAS NO MORE HAVING DIED IN THE CAUSE I THOUGHT RIGHT
AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS HER BROTHER AND THAT HE'D DONE SOMETHING AWFUL,--COMMITTED A ROBBERY OR FORGED SOMETHING
JOYCE ALSO AS A RULE HAD HER WAY IN MATTERS AND SHE HAD IT NOW
HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
LATELY IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR ME TO MAKE A BUSINESS TRIP TO NEW YORK IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MINE AND I DECIDED TO COME BY WAY OF EUROPE SINCE I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT PORTION OF THE GLOBE
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THAT MAKES ME SURE
I THINK HE WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW CAME IT IN THE FIRE THE TWO GIRLS STOOD LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND AT THE LOCKET MORE BEWILDERED THAN EVER BY THIS CURIOUS DISCOVERY
THEY FOUND GOLIATH ALREADY IN THE CELLAR OWING NO DOUBT TO THE FACT THAT BATES'S PUP WAS PATROLLING THE FRONT YARD
I WONDER HOW LONG THESE CANDLES WILL LAST QUESTIONED JOYCE GLANCING AT HER OWN TIMEPIECE
AT THE GATE MR COLLINGWOOD TURNED TO THE GIRLS
WE'LL GO THIS AFTERNOON RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL BUT THERE'S A MEETING OF THE SIGMA SIGMA SOCIETY THIS AFTERNOON CYNTHIA REMONSTRATED AND THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THAT LITTLE PLAY
THE MURDERED PERSON WOULD BE MISSED AND PEOPLE WOULD WONDER WHY THE PLACE WAS LEFT LIKE THIS AND THE--THE AUTHORITIES WOULD GET IN HERE IN A HURRY
I NEVER KNEW YOU TO GO SO DEEPLY INTO ANYTHING OF THIS KIND BEFORE CYNTHIA STARTED AND BLUSHED AGAIN
I CATCH MYSELF A DOZEN TIMES A DAY JUST GOING TO MAKE SOME INNOCENT REMARK ABOUT THE B
IT JUST SEEMED--SOMEHOW--APPROPRIATE BUT JOYCE IN SPITE OF HER PROTESTS ACCOMPANIED CYNTHIA UP THE TINY CRAMPED STAIRWAY THE ENTRANCE TO WHICH THEY HAD NOT BLOCKED BY RESTORING THE BOOK-SHELVES
MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
WHY I WANT TO DUST THIS PLACE AND CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY SOME OF THE DIRT AND COBWEBS
HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
HE'S DEAD EVIDENTLY HE ISN'T REPLIED JOYCE OR HE WOULDN'T BE HERE
BUT PERHAPS WE WILL FIND SOMETHING THAT PROVES IT LATER SHE HELD THE CANDLE OVER ONE OF THE TRUNKS AND PEERED IN
AND HE COULDN'T HAVE COME OUT EITHER SIDE OR WE'D HAVE SEEN HIM
FOR FACING THE ROOM ONCE MORE THE MYSTERIOUS PICTURE LOOKED FORTH--THE PORTRAIT OF TWO BABIES
IT WAS PLAINLY A BOY'S ROOM
WHEN HE HAD GONE TO HIS ROOM TO PACK HIS THINGS SHE WENT AND DISMISSED HER SERVANTS AND TOLD THEM TO GO AT ONCE
I SUPPOSE HE CLIMBED INTO THE BUSHES HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT WITHOUT BEING IN REACH OF THE PUP RETORTED JOYCE
THEY REMAINED STANDING AT THE GATE WATCHING THE TWO GO DOWN THE STREET IN THE SUNSET AND WAVED TO THEM WILDLY AS THEY TURNED TO LOOK BACK JUST BEFORE ROUNDING THE CORNER
AN ENORMOUS SIDEBOARD OCCUPIED ALMOST AN ENTIRE END OF THE ROOM
IT WAS WITHOUT DOUBT A SOFT TIPTOEING STEP
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SOMEBODY GOT IN AND STOLE IT VENTURED CYNTHIA
A LOT OF THINGS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BURNED HERE MOSTLY OLD LETTERS
THERE ISN'T A DOUBT BUT WHAT THAT BABY WAS SHE THEY TORE THEMSELVES AWAY FROM THE PORTRAIT AFTER A TIME AND COMMENCED DIGGING AT THE DUST AND COBWEBS OF THE LIBRARY
THE ROOMS WERE RE-PAPERED ONCE BUT I WAS AWAY WHEN IT WAS DONE
WHEN I ARRIVED IN THIS STREET AND SAW THE OLD HOUSE STILL STANDING FORLORN UNKEMPT APPARENTLY DESERTED AND QUITE UNCHANGED SINCE I KNEW IT I WAS STILL MORE ASTONISHED
BUT OH!--IT'S TRUE THEN
MY MOTHER AND I OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE BEYOND ALL EXPRESSING
BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE
THAT ENDED ALL THOUGHTS OF MY COMING NORTH FOR A LONG WHILE AS I WAS MISERABLY WEAK AND HELPLESS FOR MONTHS AFTER AND IN FACT HAVE NEVER QUITE RECOVERED MY STRENGTH
WELL THAT STARTED HER AS I WAS SURE IT WOULD
I NEVER WOULD HAVE CONNECTED ANYTHING IN THE PAPER WITH WHAT HAPPENED HERE SHERLOCK HOLMES WOULD HAVE MUSED JOYCE
THAT'S QUEER
IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
I CAN'T EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY BUT I FEEL THERE IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DISCOVERED YET,--SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO KNOW
I WONDER IF SHE IS ALIVE YET IN THE LIBRARY JOYCE PICKED UP THE PAPER THAT HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THROUGH THE HELP OF GOLIATH AND LOOKED IT OVER CURIOUSLY
IT WAS THEN NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK AND I DIDN'T WANT FATHER OR MOTHER TO KNOW ABOUT IT SO I TEASED ANNE INTO RUNNING OUT TO THE POST-OFFICE WITH ME
BUT I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY STORY YET OH DO GO ON THEN IMPLORED CYNTHIA
THE SOUND APPEARED TO BE APPROACHING THE DOOR
THE LOVELY LADY I'LL HAVE TO CALL HER THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HER NAME WAS GIVING A PARTY AND EVERY ONE WAS AT DINNER WHEN WORD WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO HER ABOUT THIS RELATIVE
SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME--THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT
OF COURSE ALL OF THEM WERE CRAZY TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT MOST OF THEM NEVER DID,--NOT TILL LONG LONG AFTERWARD ANYWAY
SHE SEEMED SO GLAD TO SEE US ALL,--ESPECIALLY ME
AND THEY SOON LEFT IT TO SEARCH ANEW EVERY ROOM BELOW IN THE HOPE OF COMING UPON THE MISSING KEY
WELL I SORT OF EXPECTED IT,--THAT IS I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE'D COME OR NOT
HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION
NONSENSE
IT'S ALL AS CLEAR AS DAY
PERHAPS HE AND HIS MOTHER MIGHT HAVE MADE IT ALL UP AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER IF HE'D ONLY LIVED
IT'S A LETTER I DID WHISPERED JOYCE
WHY INDEED SHOULD I
ISN'T IT A BEAUTY
I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX
THEN,--ONE DAY,--I FOUND IT
I JUST SENT IT TO CHESTERTON SOUTH CAROLINA BECAUSE THAT WAS ALL THE ADDRESS I KNEW
NAPKINS YELLOWED WITH AGE WERE FALLEN ABOUT DROPPED APPARENTLY IN SUDDEN FORGETFULNESS
CYNTHIA PONDERED A MOMENT
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE TOPPLED OVER AND SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR IN A DEAD FAINT DIDN'T I TELL YOU SO LONG AGO EXCLAIMED CYNTHIA
IT'S ALL SO STRANGE--SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT SO THEY WENT THROUGH THE DRAWING-ROOM ENTERED THE LIBRARY AND PLACED THEIR CANDLESTICKS ON THE MANTEL WHERE THE LIGHT WOULD BEST ILLUMINATE THE PORTRAIT OF THE LOVELY LADY
YOU STAY HERE AND WAIT SHE SPED AWAY TOWARD HER OWN HOUSE BUT WAS SOON BACK MATCHES AND CANDLE UNDER HER SWEATER HER HANDS FULL OF FRESH COOKIES
I'VE LAIN AWAKE NIGHTS THINKING OF IT
WE CAN'T TELL ABOUT THAT ALL THIS WHILE CYNTHIA HAD BEEN STANDING CANDLE IN ONE HAND AND DUST-CLOTH IN THE OTHER
GLAD OF ANY DIVERSION SHE OPENED IT AND READ
OH I WISH I WERE SHERLOCK HOLMES OH I WISH I WERE SHERLOCK HOLMES MERCY
I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH
YOU CAN'T SEE EVERYTHING JUST AT ONE GLANCE
QUICK CRIED CYNTHIA
THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED
I WANT IT LIT UP SHE ANNOUNCED
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
I GOT TOGETHER AN OUTFIT AND BADE A LONG FAREWELL TO EVEN THE ROUGH CIVILIZATION OF CALIFORNIA
I'VE THOUGHT IT OUT SHE SAID QUIETLY
AND I HOPE BEFORE THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE PUZZLED OUT THIS MYSTERY
I CAN'T MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF IT BEGAN CYNTHIA SLOWLY AT LAST
YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE HAS NEVER GOTTEN OVER IT OR SHE WOULD HAVE COME BACK HERE SOMETIME
YES THAT IS THE BOY SAID CYNTHIA
GOLIATH BEATS US ALL
I DON'T THINK IT WILL HARM
SOME OF THEM LOOKED VERY ATTRACTIVE TO ME
I'LL BE CLEANED OUT BY THAT TIME THAT MORNING THEY CAREFULLY DUSTED THE DRAWING-ROOM AND LIBRARY OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE
GO AND GET IT COMMANDED JOYCE BURSTING WITH EXCITEMENT
DO YOU KNOW WE'VE NEVER HAD THAT ILLUMINATION IN THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE THAT WE PLANNED LAST FALL WHEN WE COMMENCED CLEANING UP THERE WE NEVER HAD ENOUGH MONEY FOR CANDLES REPLIED JOYCE
OH CYNTHIA READ IT AND CYNTHIA DOUBTING NO LONGER READ ALOUD
MAYBE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THIS HOUSE WAS NEW WHEN THIS ROOM WASN'T A LIBRARY
TRUE TO JOY'S PREDICTION THE SILK CORD SNAPPED AT ONCE AND THE PICTURE'S WHOLE WEIGHT RESTED IN THEIR HANDS
WHATEVER IS THE MATTER WITH YOU STANDING HERE LIKE THAT I WAS JUST THINKING--SEEMS TO ME I REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT THE FIRST DAY WE GOT INTO THE B
IT'S SOME ESTATE
NOW WE ARE ALL SERENE SHE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY OPENING A DOOR WHICH THEY FOUND GAVE ON A FLIGHT OF STEPS
THEN I SUDDENLY LOCKED THE DOOR ON THE OUTSIDE AND BEFORE GIVING MYSELF TIME FOR A SECOND THOUGHT I RUSHED DOWN-STAIRS OUT OF DOORS AND THREW THE KEY INTO THE OLD WELL,--WHERE I COULD NEVER GET IT AGAIN
HAVE YOU ANY THEORY ABOUT THAT
FOR A MOMENT SHE PAUSED SURPRISED UNCERTAIN ALMOST TREMBLING
THE CHAIRS STOOD IN IRREGULAR GROUPS OF TWOS AND THREES CHUMMING COZILY TOGETHER AS THEIR OCCUPANTS HAD DOUBTLESS DONE AND OVER THE PIANO HAD BEEN CARELESSLY THROWN A LONG FILMY SILK SCARF ONE END HANGING TO THE FLOOR
MERCY ME
LATER CYNTHIA PUT AWAY HER WORK YAWNED AND ROSE FROM THE TABLE
I FEEL LIKE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
ISN'T IT THE MOST REMARKABLE THING SHE EXCLAIMED WHEN JOYCE HAD FINISHED THAT EACH OF US SHOULD WRITE I TO THE MOTHER AND YOU TO THE SON AND NEITHER OF US EVEN GUESS WHAT THE OTHER WAS DOING
WHEN FREED FROM ITS COATING OF BLACK ONE SIDE PROVED TO BE OF SHINING METAL PROBABLY GOLD AND THE OTHER OF SOME WHITE OR YELLOWISH SUBSTANCE THE GIRLS COULD NOT TELL JUST WHAT
I WANT TO SEE THE WEATHER REPORT FOR TO-MORROW
COME AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE LIBRARY
CYNTHIA WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY LEFT IN SUCH A HURRY BUT CYNTHIA THE UNIMAGINATIVE WAS EQUALLY UNABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUERY SATISFACTORILY SO SHE ONLY REPLIED
DO YOU SUPPOSE WE COULD TURN IT AROUND OH I'D LOVE TO ONLY I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE OUGHT
THEN AS YOU HAVE HEARD I WILLED THE HOUSE ITSELF AND THE LAND TO THE SOUTHERN SOCIETY AS I HAD NO ONE TO WHOM I WISHED TO LEAVE IT AND MY MEANS WERE SUFFICIENT SO THAT I DID NOT NEED TO SELL IT
BESIDE THAT MY VERY PRIDE WAS ANOTHER BARRIER
AFTER I GOT HOME I SAT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT
BUT THEY WERE THICK LILAC BUSHES GROWN HIGH AND RANK
THE PORTRAIT MUST HAVE BEEN PAINTED WHEN THE GARMENT WAS NEW
I TRIED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION BUT YOU WERE STILL AS MAD AS YOU COULD BE SO I MADE UP MY MIND I'D GO HOME AND PUZZLE OVER IT BY MYSELF AND I TOOK THE PAPER WITH ME
SO I CAME IN--AS MR ARTHUR CALTHORPE--AND THE MYSTERY DEEPENED TENFOLD WHEN I SAW THIS OLD ROOM ALL LIT UP PRECISELY AS I HAD REMEMBERED IT SO MANY YEARS AGO
THEN SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN HER ROOM TILL HER BOY WENT AWAY
THAT'S OVER FORTY YEARS AGO FOR THIS IS 1905
WE CAN'T TELL YET
WHAT DO YOU INQUIRE FOR DUCKIE
WHEN SHE RETURNED THEY CAREFULLY WIPED FROM THE PAINTING ITS INCH-THICK COATING OF THE DUST OF YEARS AND AGAIN HELD THEIR CANDLES TO ILLUMINE THE RESULT
DO HURRY CYN
AT THE END OF THOSE HARD BUT INTERESTING YEARS IN CALIFORNIA RUMORS DRIFTED TO ME OF GOLDEN POSSIBILITIES IN UPPER CANADA AND I DECIDED TO TRY MY LUCK IN THE NEW FIELD
AND WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF A STORY IN THAT OLD BOARDED-UP HOUSE
BESIDES WE'VE NO BUSINESS IN THERE
THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO BUT SIT AND ENJOY THE SPECTACLE CYNTHIA DID NOT REPLY TO THIS BUT LIT THE CANDLES AND GAVE A LAST LOOK ABOUT
I'M CRAZY TO SEE IT I DON'T CARE CRIED JOYCE RECKLESSLY
NOW ISN'T THIS PROVOKING EXCLAIMED JOYCE
THEY AREN'T A THIRD GONE YET
I DON'T CARE WHAT BECAME OF HIM AS LONG AS HE GOT AWAY FROM BATES'S PUP AND I'M VERY COMFORTABLE RIGHT HERE CYNTHIA WAS LARGE AND FAIR AND PLUMP AND INCLINED TO BE A LITTLE INDOLENT
QUESTION
THESE MOODS WERE ALWAYS PARTICULARLY IRRITATING TO CYNTHIA WHO RARELY INDULGED IN CAUSELESS HILARITY ESPECIALLY AT STUDY PERIODS
BUT THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND VERY WELL THEN AGREED CYNTHIA MEEKLY COWED BUT BEWILDERED
AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN GET NICE WAX CANDLES ONLY PENNY TALLOW ONES
SHE MAY HAVE STAYED LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE BOARDING UP DONE OR SHE MAY HAVE ORDERED SOME ONE TO DO IT LATER
SUDDENLY HOWEVER THE TENSION WAS BROKEN BY MRS COLLINGWOOD EXCLAIMING
WON'T BE MUCH MORE CHANCE TO GO CANOEING THIS SEASON THEY SAT DOWN LISTLESSLY ON THE VERANDA STEPS AND SOLACED THEMSELVES WITH THE LAST REMNANTS OF THE COOKIES
I RECKON WE'RE DOING PRETTY NEARLY AS WELL AS SHERLOCK WHEN YOU COME TO THINK OF IT PERHAPS THAT'S SO ADMITTED JOYCE THOUGHTFULLY
SHE MUST REST AND WE HAVE MUCH TO TALK OVER
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT YOU KNEW THE HOUSE WAS LEFT FURNISHED THAT SOMEBODY HAD TOLD YOUR FATHER SO WHY OF COURSE CRIED JOYCE EXCITED AT ONCE
THE THIRD ALAS
MY LITTLE GIRLS SHE BEGAN FORGIVE ME!--YOU SEEM LITTLE AND YOUNG TO ME THOUGH
TAKE THIS ONE AND I'LL CARRY THE OTHER
ADDED TO THAT THE COLD HAD BEEN SO CONSTANT AND INTENSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNSAFE TO VENTURE INTO THE UNLIGHTED UNHEATED AND UNVENTILATED OLD MANSION
WE'D BE TRESPASSERS
BOTH GIRLS GASPED AND STARED INCREDULOUSLY FIRST AT THE SCENE BEFORE THEM THEN AT EACH OTHER
GARMENTS OF MANY DESCRIPTIONS AND ALL OF OLD-TIME CUT WERE FLUNG ACROSS THE BED AND ON THE FLOOR NEAR IT LAY AN OPEN VALISE HALF PACKED WITH BOOKS
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY INDULGED IN NOTHING OF THE SORT
BUT HER FATHER PAID A VISIT TO THE OLD LADY ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN HE WAS IN THAT VICINITY
YOU KNOW THAT ROOM IS RIGHT OVER THIS
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME YOU'RE FREE TO SAY SO
FOUND IT IN A MASS NEAR THE SURFACE AND IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT I ACTUALLY HAD LITTLE ELSE TO DO BUT SHOVEL IT OUT WASH IT AND LAY THE PRECIOUS NUGGETS ASIDE TILL AT LENGTH THE VEIN WAS EXHAUSTED
OH NEVER MIND IT SIGHED JOYCE
I'M NERVOUS I GUESS THERE I DID HEAR SOMETHING IT WAS JOYCE WHO SPOKE
WE HAVE HAD BITTER WORDS BUT I AM LEAVING YOU WITH NO ANGER IN MY HEART AND NOTHING BUT LOVE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAIN HALL THEY ENTERED AN APARTMENT THAT WAS NOT A BEDROOM BUT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN USED AS A SITTING-ROOM AND FOR SEWING
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE NEXT TO THAT RAMSHACKLE OLD PLACE I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME SHE'D KNOWN THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO LIVE THERE WHO WERE THEY DEMANDED JOYCE EAGERLY
AND WE NEVER HAVE AND NOW HERE'S ONE RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES JOYCE WAS ALMOST TEARFUL IN HER EARNESTNESS TO CONVINCE THE DOUBTING CYNTHIA
HER SON DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT HOWEVER
YOU'RE THE BEST DETECTIVE OF US ALL
BUT THAT DOOR WAS IN THE WAY
SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HUMAN IF SHE'D READ THAT HEART-RENDING LETTER AND NOT GONE TO WORK AT ONCE AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO REACH HER SON
AFTER THAT THEY REMOVED ALL THE BREAKABLE ORNAMENTS FROM THE MANTEL AND DREW ANOTHER CHAIR CLOSE TO THE FIREPLACE
I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN I'M NOT AWAKE JOYCE PINCHED OBLIGINGLY AND WITH VIGOR THEREBY ELICITING FROM HER COMPANION A MUFFLED SQUEAK
I GAVE IT UP LONG AGO
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS COULD BE DIMLY DISCERNED THE LIGHTED CANDLE THREW BUT A FEEBLE ILLUMINATION ON THE BIG BARE SPACE THEY STOOD IN
IS THAT A RAT BOTH GIRLS JUMPED TO THEIR FEET AND STOOD LISTENING TO THE STRANGE SOUNDS THAT CAME FROM UNDER THE VALANCE HANGING ABOUT THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT FOUR-POSTER BED
I DID NOT EVEN FEEL SURE THAT THE NAME WAS NOT ASSUMED TO HIDE AN IDENTITY
IT STOOD RATHER HIGH ON A SLOPING LAWN AND WE HAVE SAID THAT IT STARED AT PASSERS-BY--WITH TRUTH BECAUSE VERY NEAR THE ROOF WERE TWO LITTLE WINDOWS SHAPED LIKE HALF-CIRCLES
BUT YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT WHO THIS MYSTERIOUS RELATIVE WAS HAVE YOU YES I HAVE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S MUCH HARDER TO DECIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE SO LITTLE TO GO ON
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HE HAS SCARED US
THE REMAINING ONE STRUGGLED FOR ANOTHER HALF-MINUTE AND FLARED UP IN ONE LAST DESPERATE EFFORT
BUT I'LL COME TO ALL THAT IN ITS PROPER PLACE
AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME
WITH CANDLE HELD HIGH JOYCE PROCEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THEIR SURROUNDINGS
ON WEIGHING IT UP I FOUND SUCH A QUANTITY THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO OBJECT IN PURSUING THE SEARCH ANY FARTHER
WELL THAT'S ALL I GUESS
FROM THERE I WORKED DOWN THROUGH INDIA FOUND MY WAY TO THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS AND LANDED AT LENGTH IN AUSTRALIA WITH THE INTENTION OF PENETRATING FARTHER INTO THAT CONTINENT THAN ANY WHITE MAN HAD YET SET FOOT
AND THE CHAIRS ABOUT IT WERE ALL PUSHED AWRY AND SOME WERE OVERTURNED
WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T WE READ THIS PAPER WHEN WE FOUND IT SHE EXCLAIMED DISGUSTEDLY
THEY MADE NO FURTHER DISCOVERIES AND TO-DAY EVEN JOYCE EXPRESSED HERSELF AS COMPLETELY DISCOURAGED
BUT THEY WERE JUST FINISHING LUNCHEON WHEN THE STRANGEST THING HAPPENED
I CAN'T EVEN THINK STRAIGHT
SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS
SO DIM WERE THEY HOWEVER WITH DIRT AND COBWEBS THAT VERY LITTLE DAYLIGHT FILTERED THROUGH
SO I SAT RIGHT DOWN AND WROTE A NOTE THAT WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
BOOK-SHELVES COMPLETELY FILLED THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM
THERE ARE JUST TWO REASONS CYNTHIA
IT HAD LOST ITS TEASING TONE AND SEEMED A LITTLE MUFFLED
BUT I LITTLE KNEW HIM
THAT DECIDED ME TO COME OUT HERE AT ONCE THIS AFTERNOON HUNT UP THE SPOT AND TRY TO DISCOVER IN THIS WAY WHETHER THERE WAS ANY USE OF PURSUING INVESTIGATIONS FURTHER IN THIS DIRECTION
WHY ON EARTH COULDN'T IT HAVE KEPT SUNNY A LITTLE LONGER
I DON'T SEE HOW SHE HAD THE STRENGTH TO DO IT
OH IT ISN'T IT ISN'T WAILED CYNTHIA
WE'LL SETTLE ALL DOUBTS IN A MOMENT SHE SNATCHED UP A CANDLE AGAIN AND LED THE WAY CYNTHIA FOLLOWING WITHOUT MORE ADO
THESE CANDLES--EVERYTHING--EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE
AT THAT TIME THE POSTAGE ON LETTERS FROM THAT REGION WAS VERY HIGH SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTS OR EVEN A DOLLAR
JUST SEE HOW THIS ROOM IS POSITIVELY TRANSFORMED
WE'LL GO THERE STRAIGHT AFTER WE GET HOME SO CYNTHIA WAS OBLIGED TO REPRESS HER IMPATIENCE A LITTLE LONGER
AS JOYCE RAISED THE CANDLE OVER HER HEAD A FLIGHT OF STAIRS COULD BE DIMLY DISCERNED
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO JOYCE
YOU PRECIOUS CAT SHE CROONED TO HIM AS HE STRUGGLED UNAPPRECIATIVELY IN HER EMBRACE
COME ON
COME ON
SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING
WE'VE TRIED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL STARING BLANKLY AT NOTHING
AS I LAY ON THE FIELD WITH SCORES OF OTHERS AFTER THE BATTLE A POOR FELLOW NEAR ME WHO HAD BEEN TERRIBLY HURT WAS MOANING AND TOSSING
I WONDER IF YOU COULD SOLVE IT WHAT IS IT ASKED CYNTHIA THANKFUL FOR ANY AWAKENING SYMPTOM OF INTEREST IN HER DIFFICULT FRIEND
SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING WRONG OR DISAPPOINTING OR DISGRACEFUL
EVEN CYNTHIA WAS KEEN FOR THE QUEST AND JOYCE WAS SIMPLY BURSTING WITH NEW IDEAS SOME OF WHICH SHE EXPOUNDED TO CYNTHIA AS THEY WERE LIGHTING THEIR CANDLES IN THE CELLAR
WHY IT'S VERY SIMPLE SAID JOYCE
NOW--_TELL ME BUT JOYCE WAS VERY SERIOUS AND VERY MYSTERIOUS TOO
THEY COULD ONLY WAIT IN RACKING SUSPENSE WHERE THEY WERE
OH SUPPOSE IT IS THE KEY SHE RAKED AWAY AGAIN FRANTICALLY AND HAULED OUT A QUANTITY OF CHARRED DEBRIS BUT NOTHING EVEN FAINTLY RESEMBLING A KEY
WE'RE JUST AS FAR FROM IT ALL AS EVER AND THEY BOTH FELL TO CHUCKLING AGAIN
SEE HERE SHE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
I VOTE FOR NEXT SATURDAY INSTEAD OF TO-DAY I CAN'T SEE WHY YOU WANT TO WAIT REPLIED CYNTHIA
I'M NOT A BIT HURT AND--WE'RE IN THEY WERE INDEED IN
BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE TO EXECUTE THE WORK IN AN OLD DESERTED MANSION SATURATED WITH MYSTERY NO PLEASURE THEY COULD THINK OF WAS TO BE COMPARED WITH IT
I SHALL BE SEVENTY-FIVE NEXT BIRTHDAY
MY OWN WOUND DID NOT HAMPER ME SO MUCH AT THE TIME SO I CRAWLED OVER TO HIM AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE TILL A SURGEON SHOULD ARRIVE
BUT CYNTHIA SHOOK HER HEAD AND CAME AWAY WITH MORE THAN FIFTY
I'VE GOT IT SHE ANNOUNCED
IF IT TAKES AN ELEPHANT TEN MINUTES TO PUT ON A WHITE VEST HOW MANY PANCAKES WILL IT TAKE TO SHINGLE A FREIGHT-CAR CYNTHIA'S INDIGNATION WAS RAPIDLY WAXING HOTTER BUT SHE MADE ONE MORE TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO CONTROL IT
WE WILL KEEP THAT FOR AN EMERGENCY BUT OUGHT WE DISTURB THEM QUESTIONED CYNTHIA
NEVER SHOW THE SLIGHTEST INTEREST IN IT
AND LOOK AT HER DRESS THOSE LONG FULL SLEEVES AND THE BIG BULGING SKIRT
AS SOON AS IT WAS DAYLIGHT SHE WENT OUT AND GOT AN OLD COLORED CARPENTER WHO LIVED NEARBY TO COME AND BOARD UP THE WINDOWS AND DOORS
I HAD AT THAT TIME RATHER A GIFT FOR MUSIC AND THIS SONG WAS A SORT OF SECRET OF OURS I NEVER SANG OR PLAYED IT FOR ANY ONE ELSE
SHE REALIZED NOW THAT SHE HAD NOT ONLY BEEN A LITTLE SELFISH ABOUT IT BUT HAD PLAINLY MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
THIS HOOP-SKIRT OR CRINOLINE I THINK THEY USED TO CALL IT GAVE IT TO ME
OH!--THERE'S ONE OTHER THING,--GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAYS SHE THINKS MRS COLLINGWOOD IS STILL ALIVE,--A VERY OLD LADY LIVING DOWN IN THE LITTLE OLD SOUTH CAROLINA TOWN OF CHESTERTON
FINALLY SHE ASKED
MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED HER TO SEE YOU SINCE YOU'VE GROWN SO AND I'VE PROPOSED A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT YOU GO WITH ME ON THE TRIP
BUT JOYCE ONLY REPLIED
YOU SEEM PERFECTLY CRAZY ABOUT THAT ROOM AND IT MAKES ME SO--SO DEPRESSED THAT I HATE TO GO NEAR IT
IT WAS NO EASY TASK TO REMOVE THE ARMFULS OF BOOKS NECESSARY TO GET AT THE DOOR BEHIND AND THEN PUSH AND SHOVE AND STRUGGLE WITH THE DUSTY SHELVES
AND BRING YOUR MUSIC OVER TOO
YOU CAN TELL THEM WHEN YOU'RE EXPLAINING ALL THIS THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR US TWO PEOPLE IS BEYOND THE POWER OF WORDS TO EXPRESS
COME AND JOIN US NOW AND WE WILL SOLVE THE RIDDLES WHICH I'M SURE ARE PUZZLING US ALL HE LED THEM OVER TO THE SOFA AND PLACED THEM BESIDE HIS MOTHER
I WAS WEALTHY AND TO SPARE AND THE LONGING CAME UPON ME TO RETURN TO MY OWN KIND AGAIN
AND WHILE THESE DATES LIMITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE TIME OF THE MYSTERIOUS HAPPENING IT DID NOT HELP THEM VERY MUCH
BUT WHAT COULD IT HAVE BEEN
HOW ABSURD
OH I'LL NEVER NEVER COME INTO THIS DREADFUL HOUSE AGAIN BUT JOYCE HAD REGAINED HER POISE
I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN
JOYCE THEN FELL TO PLANNING HOW SHE COULD GET INTO COMMUNICATION WITH THIS GREAT-AUNT LUCIA
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE GLANCED COVERTLY IN CYNTHIA'S DIRECTION
RECOGNIZE IT
THERE'S NOTHING BACK THERE BUT THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE SHE REMARKED
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU WANTED ME TO GO
THESE LITTLE DIFFERENCES WERE AS A FACT OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND NEITHER OF THEM EVER CHERISHED THE LEAST GRUDGE TOWARD THE OTHER WHEN THEY WERE OVER
SOMEHOW I FEEL AS IF I JUST LOVED HER--SHE'S SUCH A DARLING
JOYCE LOOKED UP A LITTLE HURT
I'VE SEEN AN OLD CHISEL IN THE KITCHEN
THERE WAS A FIRE THERE
IN DIMENSIONS IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE DINING-ROOM RUNNING FROM FRONT TO BACK OF THE HOUSE
I JUST WONDER WHETHER THEY WENT OFF OF THEIR OWN ACCORD OR WERE DISMISSED
ADDED TO THIS THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR CLEANING-UP HAD WANED CONSIDERABLY
BUT JOYCE'S EYE WAS CAUGHT BY TWO CANDLESTICKS STANDING ON THE MANTEL
BUT JOYCE SLEPT LITTLE THAT NIGHT
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM BEHIND THEM A SUDDEN SCRATCHING AND SCRAMBLING AND THEN A THUD
NO ONE EVER CAME IN OR OUT
WHEN CYNTHIA HAD WIPED AWAY THE VEIL OF DUST THAT COVERED IT WITH THE DUST-CLOTH SHE HAD THOUGHTFULLY TUCKED IN HER BELT THE GIRLS BENT OVER IT
WELL ANYWAY WE GOT AT THE STORY IN ANOTHER FASHION
AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION
SEE THAT ENORMOUS CAT WALKING IN
HE'D HAVE HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT AND PROVED BY NOW JOYCE GOT TO HER FEET AND BEGAN ROAMING ABOUT RESTLESSLY
BUT BY THE WAY DID IT EVER STRIKE YOU THAT WE MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING TO LOOK OVER SOME OF THE BOOKS IN THAT OLD LIBRARY
I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE EVER MENTIONED IT
THIS IS ONLY THE HALL
AS I HAVE SAID I NATURALLY SUPPOSED THAT THE PROPERTY HAD CHANGED HANDS MANY TIMES BEFORE THIS
CYNTHIA HOWEVER PULLED HER TO HER FEET
HE HAD TO LEAVE THAT TOO YOU SEE OR PERHAPS HE INTENDED TO SEND FOR IT LATER COMMENTED JOYCE
THE THREE COULD HEAR EACH OTHER BREATHE
BUT THEY ENTERED THE DRAWING-ROOM FIRST AND STOOD A LONG WHILE BEFORE THE FIREPLACE GAZING AT THE PICTURE'S MASSIVE FRAME AND ITS CHALLENGING WOODEN BACK
HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY
AND SHE GATHERED UP HER BOOKS AND BELONGINGS GIVING HER FRIEND A QUEER LOOK AS SHE LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
COME ON HALF WHISPERED JOYCE LET'S SEE THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL
IT WAS NOT ADVERTISED FOR SALE
GOOD-BY
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW THIS REMEMBERING NOT TO SPEAK OF IT HAS GOT ON MY NERVES
OH YOU ARE TOO PARTICULAR
THE FLASH OF RED SPEEDING TOWARD HER DEVELOPED INTO A BRIGHT RED SWEATER CAP AND SKIRT
IT IS SOMETHING I CANNOT SPEAK ABOUT
IT WILL BE THE GREATEST LARK EVER
HOW DID THAT GET BOARDED UP I HAVE THOUGHT THAT OUT SAID JOYCE
AFTER A TRIFLING RESISTANCE IT YIELDED
MR COLLINGWOOD TAKING THE KEY FROM HIS MOTHER LOCKED THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE BOARDING AFTER THEM
ARTHUR ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED
THERE'S AN EXTRA CANDLE THAT I LEFT ON THE MANTEL
BUT I'VE READ THAT THE CONFEDERATES CONSIDERED THEIR CAUSE ALMOST A--A RELIGION
OH FATHER SHE CRIED IN REAL CONTRITION I WAS MEAN TO REFUSE YOU
NOW YOU HOLD MY CANDLE AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS SHE HANDED HER CANDLE TO CYNTHIA BRACED HERSELF AND THREW HER WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE LOW DOOR WHICH WAS KNOBLESS LIKE THE ONE BELOW
OH DON'T LET'S TRY TO PUZZLE OVER IT ANY MORE JUST NOW INTERRUPTED JOYCE
NEVER MIND
HIS IRON-GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS
OH NO
OH NO
THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY NOW IN IDENTIFYING HER WITH THAT PICTURE
JUST WHAT IT IS
LET'S TRY THE KEYS OF THE OTHER DOORS
PRESENTLY SHE SPOKE
YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE YES
IN THE FIRST PLACE I NEVER EXPECTED HIM TO COME OUT HERE AT ALL,--AT LEAST NOT RIGHT AWAY
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY ANYWAY
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ROOM CYNTHIA GAZED ABOUT HER CRITICALLY
NOT THE SERVANTS
WE COULDN'T GO AND QUESTION THEM FOR IT'S PLAIN FROM WHAT THE AGENT SAID THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT
NO ONE--NO ONE EVER KNEW THAT SONG BUT MRS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY
THE HEAVY DARKNESS SEEMED TO CAST A SPELL OVER EVEN THE IRREPRESSIBLE JOYCE
CAUSE WHY
WELL I COULD GET IN THE SAME WAY AND SO COULD YOU SHE GAVE THE BOARDS A SHARP PULL AND SUCCEEDED IN DISLODGING ANOTHER
OH I DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAME
WE MUST BE MORE CAREFUL AFTER THIS AND LEAVE EVERYTHING AS WE FIND IT THEY TIPTOED ALONG THE HALL WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE CONFIDENCE THAN ON THEIR FORMER VISIT PAUSING TO HOLD THEIR CANDLES UP TO THE PICTURES AND PEEPING FOR A MOMENT INTO THE CURIOUSLY DISARRANGED DINING-ROOM
I'M SURE I DON'T WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE SHERLOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THIS TIME GETTING AT THE FINAL FACTS ABOUT OUR BOARDED-UP HOUSE
BATES'S PUP REPLIED CYNTHIA LACONICALLY
YOU HAVE GIVEN BACK TO US THE MOST PRICELESS BLESSING,--THE ONE THING WE NEITHER HOPED NOR EXPECTED TO ENJOY AGAIN IN THIS WORLD,--_EACH OTHER HE COULD NOT GO ON
I DON'T CARE THOUGH
SOMEBODY IS AT THAT FRONT DOOR CRIED JOYCE
FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING I'VE PRETTY NEARLY SETTLED THOUGH
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT BEFORE
WE ONLY ASKED OUT OF CURIOSITY
BUT I'M RESTED NOW
I'M COMING SHE ADOPTED JOYCE'S MODE OF INGRESS BUT FOUND IT SCARCELY AS EASY AS IT LOOKED AND HER FEET SWUNG IN SPACE GROPING WILDLY FOR THE STEPS DESCRIBED
OF COURSE FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS MY ANGER HAD BEEN SO GREAT AND MY GRIEF WAS STILL SO TERRIBLE THAT I FELT I COULD NEVER NEVER LOOK UPON THE PLACE OR ANYTHING IN IT AGAIN
I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HE'D EVER WANT TO PART WITH IT PROBABLY HE WENT IN SUCH A HURRY THAT HE COULDN'T THINK OF EVERYTHING AND LEFT THIS BY MISTAKE
I'M CRAZY TO EXPLORE IT ALL TOGETHER THEY TIPTOED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL
IT'S AN EMPTY HOUSE THAT'S JUST WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN RETORTED JOYCE
NOW WHERE CAN HE BE
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH
YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS SAID WE'D LOVE TO HAVE SOME ADVENTURES ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE
LET X EQUAL THE NUMBER OF PANCAKES THE END OF CYNTHIA'S PATIENCE HAD COME HOWEVER
I'VE GOT THE CANDLE LIT CYNTHIA SUDDENLY SURRENDERED
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING THERE WAS SO MUCH SUPPRESSED MYSTERY IN JOY'S VOICE THAT CYNTHIA OBEYED WITHOUT DEMUR AND BACK OF THE BUSHES FOUND HER EXAMINING A LITTLE BOARDED-UP WINDOW INTO THE CELLAR
SO YOU SEE I WAS QUITE UNPREPARED TO SEE HIM RUSHING OUT HERE AT ONCE
YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT
ONE BRILLIANT SATURDAY MORNING EARLY IN MAY THE GIRLS CLAMBERED THROUGH THE FENCE WITH THEIR BOOKS AND FANCY-WORK TO SPEND SOME OF THE SHINING HOUR UNDER THE WHITE CANOPY OF BLOSSOMS
SUDDENLY JOYCE STARTED NERVOUSLY
MORE NEXT WEEK
I HAVE IT CRIED JOYCE AT LENGTH
AS SHE FITTED IN THE FIRST VOLUME HER EYE WAS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY SOMETHING BACK OF THE SHELVES ILLUMINATED IN THE FLICKERING CANDLE-LIGHT
THIS HOUSE WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO YOU
NOW I WONDER WHY BUT LOOK HERE CRIED CYNTHIA
BUT I KNOW YOU WON'T
THAT WAS YOUR GREAT-AUNT LUCIA WHAT JOYCE ALMOST SHOUTED IN HER ASTONISHMENT
IT'S THE ONLY THING LEFT THE LAST RESORT AS THEY SAY IN STORIES SAID CYNTHIA
NOW FOR THE ROOM ON THE RIGHT JOYCE HAULED OPEN A PAIR OF CLOSED FOLDING-DOORS AND HELD THE CANDLE ABOVE HER HEAD
GREAT-AUNT LUCIA MUST BE A VERY INTERESTING OLD LADY FATHER SHE IS SHE CERTAINLY IS
THEN THEY ALL BEGAN AGAIN TO QUESTION HER ABOUT WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT SHE WOULDN'T TELL THEM
THAT'S THE NEXT MOST INTERESTING THING I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN HER FATHER OR MOTHER REPLIED JOYCE THOUGHTFULLY
THE CURTAINS ARE NOT DRAWN OR THE SHUTTERS CLOSED
BUT LATER SHE THOUGHT THAT SURELY WHEN HE CAME SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM OUT OF IT
WHY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE
THESE OLD-FASHIONED KEYS ARE SO IMMENSE THAT IT HARDLY SEEMS POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE WOULD CARRY ONE OFF--FAR CONJECTURED JOYCE
HAVE YOU GONE CRAZY
BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RELENTING IN THAT YOUNG LADY
AND HERE'S THE KEYHOLE
THERE WAS STILL THE BIG MAIN DOOR TO PASS
CYNTHIA SHE BEGAN
NO THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE STOPPED LONG ENOUGH TO COLLECT IT AND PUT IT AWAY,--OR TAKE IT WITH THEM
THE SHOCK OF IT ALMOST KILLED HER
THIS LETTER I SENT OFF BY MY GUIDE TO BE MAILED AT THE NEAREST TRADING-POST
DO YOU KNOW CYNTHIA I HEARD THE MOST INTERESTING PROBLEM THE OTHER DAY
WHY NOT HAVE SOME MORE BURNING WE'VE ONLY THREE LEFT COMMENTED CYNTHIA PRACTICAL AS EVER
WHATEVER HAPPENED IT WASN'T THAT ANYBODY DIED
SHE HAD HER HAT AND COAT ON AND HER BOOKS UNDER HER ARM INSIDE OF SEVEN MINUTES AND THE TWO GIRLS HURRIED AWAY TOGETHER
OH I HAVE AN IDEA CYNTHIA
I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND DAY OR NIGHT YES CRIED JOYCE AND I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN I COULD HARDLY INDUCE YOU TO ENTER IT
I NEVER SAW ANY ONE LIKE YOU CYNTHIA SPRAGUE
MY HEAD IS SIMPLY IN A WHIRL
WHEN WE GET THERE THE WINDOW WILL GUIDE US CYNTHIA STRUCK THE FIRST MATCH AND THEY HURRIEDLY PICKED THEIR WAY AROUND THE SCATTERED FURNITURE
YOU SEE THE YOUNG FELLOW HAD BEEN BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN THE NORTH AND HIS SYMPATHIES WERE ALL WITH THAT SIDE AND HE WAS JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT AS HIS MOTHER WAS ABOUT THE OTHER
NEXT FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD IN THE HALL
BUT DON'T YOU SEE INSISTED JOYCE THAT HE MUST HAVE HIDDEN IN SOME STRANGE PLACE,--AND ONE HE MUST HAVE KNOWN ABOUT TOO FOR HE WENT STRAIGHT TO IT
YOU CAN'T THINK HOW DIFFERENT MY IDEA OF HIM WAS AND NATURALLY THAT HELPED ALL THE MORE TO THROW ME OFF THE TRACK BUT WHY BEGAN CYNTHIA AFRESH
HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER
OH I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO THINK OF IT JOYCE'S EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS AS SHE GAZED UP AT THE PROUD BEAUTIFUL FACE ABOVE THEM
NOW FOR UP-STAIRS CRIED JOYCE
AS THE YEARS PASSED ON HOWEVER AND MY FEELINGS ALTERED I DID BEGIN TO THINK IT A PITY THAT THE PLACE SHOULD RUN TO NEGLECT AND RUIN
DON'T YOU THINK SO CYNTHIA DID
HERE'S A FIND SHE ANNOUNCED
BUT SHE HAS MADE A WILL LEAVING IT TO THE SOUTHERN SOCIETY WHEN SHE DIES
A HEAVY ROPELIKE CORD WITH LARGE SILK TASSELS ATTACHED THE PICTURE TO ITS HOOK AND THE CORD WAS TWISTED AS IF SOME ONE HAD TURNED THE PICTURE ABOUT WITHOUT STOPPING TO READJUST IT
BEFORE ENTERING CYNTHIA THOROUGHLY DUSTED THE WINDOW-LEDGE AND AS FAR ABOUT IT AS SHE COULD REACH WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE WAS LESS IF ANY DAMAGE TO THEIR CLOTHES
LOOK
LOOK
SHE SAID SHE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE LADY THROUGH MEETING HER A SHORT TIME BEFORE AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND IN NEW YORK
THEY WERE NO SOONER DOWN THE STEPS THAN JOYCE BEGAN
SO THAT ACCOUNTS FOR OUR MISTAKE
BUT WHAT A TERRIBLE THING FOR THE POOR MOTHER TO THINK THAT SHE AND HER SON HAD PARTED IN ANGER AND NOW WERE NEVER NEVER TO MEET AGAIN AND MAKE IT ALL UP
AND THINK HOW HE MUST HAVE FELT TOO
I HAD ALMOST DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER ONCE MORE WHEN IN SYDNEY NEW SOUTH WALES WHERE I HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING OVER THE FILES OF AN OLD NEW YORK PAPER IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY I STUMBLED ON THE DEATH-NOTICE OF A MRS FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD OF CHESTERTON SOUTH CAROLINA
TRYING TO LIGHT THE CANDLE
I'LL BRING A DUST-CLOTH TOO AND AN OLD BROOM
IT WAS OF COURSE AS BUT A DROP IN THE BUCKET IN COMPARISON WITH ALL THE SCRUBBING AND CLEANING THAT WAS NEEDED
THERE WERE BY THE WAY NO TRACES OF CANDLES ABOUT THE HOUSE
AND WHEN SHE HAD GONE AROUND SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE IT WAS MORNING
DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS QUEER CYNTHIA WHAT COULD HAVE BECOME OF GOLIATH NOT AT ALL REPLIED CYNTHIA WHO HAD NO SPECIAL GIFT OF IMAGINATION
BUT WHEN THE NEW YORK PAPER COPIED IT THEY LEFT OUT ALL ABOUT THE SURVIVING COUSIN AND MERELY MENTIONED THE NAME OF THE DECEASED AS MRS FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD MY MOTHER HAD THIS RECTIFIED IN A LATER PUBLICATION OF THE PAPER BUT THAT OF COURSE I NEVER SAW
IF SOME ONE ELSE STOOD UP THERE AND TURNED THE PICTURE AROUND WHY COULDN'T WE DO THE SAME
THEN AS SHE NEVER DID HE MAY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS ALL USELESS AND HOPELESS AND HE'D BETTER LET THE REPORT STAND AND HE DISAPPEAR AND NEVER COME BACK
IT'S A COLLECTION OF ENGLISH PAPERS FULL OF JOKES AND POLITICS AND THAT SORT OF THING
ANYWAY THEY NEVER CAME BACK TO FINISH THE MEAL
HE DOESN'T KNOW US AND WON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING
I WILL ONLY SAY THAT I BECAME DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE AUSTRALIAN GOLD MINES BOUGHT UP ONE FINALLY AND HAVE SUPERINTENDED ITS RUNNING EVER SINCE
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A FLASH OF RED ON A VERANDA FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND A LONG MUSICAL WHISTLE
IF YOU DO IT'S YOUR GUILTY CONSCIENCE TROUBLING YOU CYNTHIA HAD NEVER SPOKEN QUITE SO SHARPLY BEFORE
SUPPOSE WE BUY SOME AND TRY IT SOON,--SAY TO-MORROW JOYCE TURNED TO HER COMPANION WITH AN ASTONISHED STARE
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT PERHAPS HE WASN'T KILLED IN THE WAR AFTER ALL,--THAT THERE'D BEEN SOME MISTAKE
THAT RED SILK CORD IT HANGS BY IS PERFECTLY ROTTEN
THAT'S THE SADDEST PART OF IT CHAPTER XII A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT THE FRIDAY AFTERNOON MEETING OF THE SIGMA SIGMA LITERARY SOCIETY BROKE UP WITH THE USUAL CONFUSED MINGLING OF CHATTER AND LAUGHTER
IN HER HURRY SHE PROBABLY FORGOT IT SAID JOYCE LAYING IT BESIDE THE CURIOUS DISK THEY HAD RAKED FROM THE FIREPLACE
THAT WAS MIGHTY CARELESS--BUT JUST LIKE JOYCE
YES I KNEW THEM--QUITE INTIMATELY
GOLIATH CHEATED OF HIS PLAYTHING WAS MAKING FUTILE DABS AT THE DANGLING VELVET RIBBON
JOY GREW SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULD HARDLY CONTAIN A HURRAH AND CYNTHIA WAS NOT FAR BEHIND HER IN ENTHUSIASM
I COULDN'T SLEEP NIGHTS TILL I'D SENT THAT LETTER BECAUSE IT ALL HAUNTED ME SO
THE SUDDEN PALL OF DARKNESS IN THIS STRANGE HOUSE OF MYSTERY WAS JUST A TINY BIT AWESOME
HALF AN HOUR LATER EXHAUSTED AND GRIMY THEY DROPPED INTO CHAIRS AND SURVEYED THE RESULTS
NO LET'S HAVE IT TO-DAY
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A GUEST-ROOM AND NO ONE WAS OCCUPYING IT WHEN--IT ALL HAPPENED
BUT IN THAT INSTANT THE DYING CANDLE-FLAME SPUTTERED FLICKERED AND WENT OUT LEAVING ONLY A SMALL MASS OF WARM TALLOW IN CYNTHIA'S HAND FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS HORRIFIED SILENCE
ONCE THEY STOOD WITHIN THE THRESHOLD HOWEVER THEY BECAME SLOWLY CONSCIOUS OF A VAGUE DISAPPOINTMENT
THEN SHE PULLED THE COLLAR OF HER WHITE SWEATER UP TO HER EARS AND BUTTONED IT OVER
HE ALWAYS DOES THAT IF HE CAN FIND ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE WARM SUDDENLY SHE SNATCHED AT THE PAPER SO VIOLENTLY THAT GOLIATH WENT TOBOGGANING OFF WITH A PROTESTING MEOUW LOOK LOOK CYNTHIA SHE EXCLAIMED BRUSHING OFF A CLOUD OF DUST WITH THE WHISK-BROOM AND POINTING TO THE TOP OF THE SHEET
THE SON WAS AWAY AT HARVARD COLLEGE,--OR AT LEAST THEY THOUGHT HE WAS AT THE TIME OF THE LUNCHEON
IT MIGHT BE MOTHER FATHER SISTER BROTHER HUSBAND SON OR DAUGHTER ANY OF THESE
CAN'T YOU SEE IT
IN THE HALL MR COLLINGWOOD LOOKED AT HIS WATCH EXCLAIMING
THEY HAD BEEN BOSOM FRIENDS FROM BABYHOOD AS THEIR PARENTS HAD BEEN BEFORE THEM
TO-DAY IS JUST AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY
C
NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGUE YOU MUST BE RIGHT ADMITTED CYNTHIA
AND WHILE THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING OVER AND PETTING GOLIATH A QUEER THING HAPPENED
THE OLD LADY MAY NOT LIVE VERY LONG SHE'S SO FEEBLE
AND I'M SURE SHE LAY ON THE BED AND CRIED A GOOD DEAL
THEN THEY ALL PASSED OUT THROUGH THE GREAT FRONT DOOR TO THE WIDE OLD VERANDA
IF WHAT I'D IMAGINED WAS TRUE IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO LET HIM GO ON THINKING THAT WHEN I KNEW THAT HIS MOTHER NEVER SAW THAT LETTER AND I DECIDED I'D LET HIM KNOW IT
WE CAN LIGHT OUR WAY OUT BY THEM CYNTHIA PRODUCED THE BOX FROM THE POCKET OF HER SWEATER AND OPENED IT
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CRAMMING FOR THE MONTHLY EXAMS AND HAD THEIR BOOKS SPREAD OUT ALL AROUND THEM
IT CAME FROM THE FRONT DOOR THERE WAS NO SHADOW OF DOUBT AND SOMEBODY HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE BOARDING
I'M SURPRISED IT HASN'T GIVEN WAY BEFORE THIS
IT AIN'T IN THE MARKET--NEVER WAS OH WE DON'T WANT TO BUY IT OR RENT IT EXPLAINED JOYCE POLITELY
ANOTHER CLOSE AT HAND HAD THE SAME APPEARANCE
BUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW--AND I DON'T MUCH CARE
I DID SHE ANNOUNCED CALMLY
OF COURSE HOUSES WERE LIGHTED BY GAS THEN BUT ONLY CITY ONES OR THOSE NEAR THE CITY
DO YOU KNOW ANY REAL ELDERLY PEOPLE FATHER DO YOU KNOW ANY REAL ELDERLY PEOPLE FATHER HE LOOKED UP WITH A QUIZZICAL EXPRESSION
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS
WHAT IS THE MATTER MATTER YOU ASK ME THAT PANTED JOYCE
WHEN THEY WERE GONE CYNTHIA AND JOYCE TURNED AND LOOKED LONG AND INCREDULOUSLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
INSTEAD OF THAT THE SLIGHT FIGURE OF A WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLACK AND WITH A LONG HEAVY DARK VEIL OVER HER FACE STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
BROKE SHORT OFF AT ITS HEAD AND PROVED USELESS
WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY C
AND WHEN HE GAVE ANOTHER NAME THAT COMPLETELY DECEIVED ME
WHERE ELSE COULD THOSE STAIRS LEAD THEN
IN THE CANDLE-LIGHT THE LOCKET GLISTENED WITH TINY JEWELS
SHE WAS KEEPING THE NEWS TO SURPRISE HIM
IT'LL BE HORRIDLY DARK AND GLOOMY IN THERE THIS AFTERNOON NONSENSE CRIED JOYCE WHO NEVER COULD BEAR TO WAIT AN INSTANT IN CARRYING OUT SOME CHERISHED PLAN
AND SOMETIME JUST ABOUT THEN SHE PROBABLY TURNED THE PICTURE TO THE WALL AND TOOK THE OTHER ONE OUT OF HER LOCKET AND THREW IT INTO THE FIRE
THE ATTIC WAS THE ONLY APARTMENT IN THIS STRANGE HOUSE THAT RECEIVED THE LIGHT OF DAY FOR THE TWO LITTLE WINDOWS LIKE STARING EYES WERE NOT BOARDED UP
THE WHOLE THING IS SO DIFFERENT NOW,--ALL FORGOTTEN AND FORGIVEN
IT WAS RAINING GREAT PELTING DROPS AS THEY SCRAMBLED OUT AND SCAMPERED FOR CYNTHIA'S VERANDA
IF THERE WERE EVEN A POSSIBILITY OF THIS I MUST RELIEVE IT
MRS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE
IT MAKES ME BLUE--EVEN TO THINK OF IT BUT CYNTHIA WAS OBDURATE
HE HAS SOMETHING UNDER THERE THAT HE'S PLAYING WITH KNOCKING IT ABOUT YOU KNOW
LOOK AT THE WINDOWS
I HAD NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IT WAS NOT VERY POLITE BUT PROBABLY EXCUSABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MAYBE SHE FAINTED AWAY SUGGESTED CYNTHIA PRACTICALLY
SURE ENOUGH AGREED CYNTHIA
THEN MISS JOYCE CAME OUT AND ANNOUNCED THAT A MEMBER OF THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY WAS HERE ON BUSINESS
PLAINLY SHE WAS IMPRESSED AT LAST
MERCY WHAT'S THAT
PERHAPS THEY ALL RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM
THEY'LL FORGIVE YOU SHE BENT DOWN AND KISSED THEM BOTH WITH A CARESS THAT THRILLED THEM TO THEIR FINGER-TIPS
BUT IN THE CANADIAN WILDERNESS I BEGAN TO SEE MATTERS IN ANOTHER LIGHT
I THOUGHT YOU ONLY DID IT TO GIVE ME A GOOD TIME AND SOMEHOW IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD TIME--THEN
THIS OF COURSE I ALWAYS GAVE TO THE GUIDE TO USE IN SENDING THE LETTER WHEN HE GOT TO THE TRADING-POST
ALMOST A WEEK HAD PASSED SINCE THE FIRST ADVENTURE OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE AND NOTHING FURTHER HAD HAPPENED
AND THOUGH I NEVER SUSPECTED IT AT THE TIME I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE POCKETED THE MONEY AND SIMPLY DESTROYED THE LETTERS
I DON'T ACCOUNT FOR IT
I BEGAN PLANNING TO COME SOON AFTER I RECEIVED IT AND TRIED TO ARRIVE AT ABOUT THE TIME YOU MENTIONED
HER VOICE SOUNDED DIFFERENT NOW
I WAS GOING TO ASK HIM THE NAME OF THE LAWYERS JOYCE EXPLAINED AS THEY HURRIED AWAY
OH JOYCE THEY LISTENED AGAIN
SHE SEEMED RATHER EXCITED
THE BOARDS IN THE BIG FRONT DOOR HAD A SMALL DOOR FASHIONED IN THEM AND THIS DOOR FASTENED WITH A VERY RUSTY LOCK
THEY SEEMED TO BE IN A WIDE CENTRAL HALL RUNNING THROUGH THE HOUSE FROM FRONT TO BACK
GOOD OLD CYNTHIA
SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE SUDDENLY AND PEOPLE JUST GOT THEIR THINGS ON AND LEFT AFTER THAT
AND I SET A SPECIAL DATE FOR YOU TO GET HERE ON PURPOSE BECAUSE--WELL BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE OUGHT TO BE HERE TO RECEIVE YOU AND HAVE THE PLACE LOOK SORT OF--HOMELIKE
SHE LOOKS VERY YOUNG BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ONE OF IMPORTANCE IN THE HOUSE PROBABLY THE MISTRESS OR SHE WOULDN'T HAVE OCCUPIED THE BIGGEST BEDROOM AND HAD HER PICTURE ON THE WALL
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU WERE GOING CRAZY OH OF COURSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND RETORTED JOYCE
HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP TO THEM GAILY AND MRS DURAND WHISPERED THAT IT WAS YOUNG FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD EVIDENTLY COMING HOME UNEXPECTEDLY
A MAN--A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER--STOOD OUTSIDE
BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE
THE PLACE HAD BEEN WITHOUT AN OCCUPANT FOR YEARS
HOW MUCH POCKET-MONEY HAVE YOU
HER ROOM AND CLOTHES AND LOCKET SHOW THAT
I REALLY THINK I LOVE THAT PICTURE AND SO IN THE ADJOINING ROOM THEY STOOD A WHILE WITH ELEVATED CANDLES GAZING FASCINATED AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
PERHAPS THEN IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT CYNTHIA AGREED TO ALL THIS WITHOUT HESITATION
BUT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT A TRIFLE MY SON IS VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW YOU TWO YOUNG THINGS HAVE COME TO BE CONCERNED IN ALL THIS AND I HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO TELL HIM--FULLY
BUT FOR THAT MATTER THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF QUESTIONING EVEN GREAT-AUNT LUCIA
AWFULLY SUDDEN THAT AND AWFULLY QUEER GOODNESS JOY
THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT FORTY--AND WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE LIBRARY TOO SAID CYNTHIA PLANNING THE CAMPAIGN
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU'D GUESS RIGHT AWAY WHEN YOU SAW HIM AT THE DOOR WHO HE WAS THAT'S JUST THE QUEER PART OF IT SAID JOYCE
I DON'T MIND
WE MUST SEE THESE TO-DAY
BUT AS THEY GREW OLDER AND MORE ABSORBED IN OUTSIDE AFFAIRS THEIR INTEREST IN IT CEASED TILL AT LENGTH IT CAME TO BE ONLY A SOURCE OF IRRITATION TO THEM SINCE IT SEPARATED THEIR HOMES BY A WIDE SPACE THAT THEY CONSIDERED RATHER A NUISANCE TO HAVE TO TRAVERSE
THINKING OF FOUNDING AN OLD PEOPLE'S HOME HE ASKED TEASINGLY
I CAN'T MOVE
SHE'S LOVELY LOVELY LOVELY SIGHED JOYCE
BUT I WANT CANDLES THERE OH IF YOU INSIST OF COURSE I'LL GO
SHE HAD BEEN TELLING ME A LOT ABOUT WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND ASKING ME ABOUT MYSELF
BUT MAINLY BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MUCH SENSE IN HER LOCKING UP THE ROOM IF SHE DID LOCK IT HAD SHE KNOWN THERE WAS ANOTHER EASY WAY OF GETTING INTO IT
OH I'D GIVE MY EYES TO KNOW CYNTHIA
THEN BY LOOKING UP THIS ONE WE CAN TELL JUST ABOUT WHAT TIME SHE LIVED
IT'S TRESPASSING CRIED CYNTHIA MAKING HER LAST STAND
AND GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAYS SHE WAS TERRIBLY HIGH-TEMPERED TOO
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT PERHAPS MY MOTHER FAR FROM CHERISHING ANY BITTER FEELING TOWARD ME NOW THAT SHE THOUGHT ME DEAD MIGHT BE SUFFERING AGONIES OF GRIEF AND REMORSE BECAUSE WE HAD NOT BEEN RECONCILED BEFORE THE END
TO-MORROW'S SATURDAY SAID JOYCE
AND THEN I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE ENVELOPE AND SAW THAT IT WAS POSTMARKED ROCKRIDGE A REGION WHICH I SPEEDILY ASCERTAINED WAS RIGHT IN THE VICINITY OF MY OLD HOME
I NEVER DREAMED THAT YOU FEEL AS YOU DO ABOUT THIS CAUSE
SHE EXCUSED HERSELF TO THEM TORE OPEN THE ENVELOPE AND READ IT
IF THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR THINGS STRANGE AND INEXPLICABLE HERE AT LAST WAS THEIR REWARD
WHY FOR INSTANCE DID HE GIVE THE NAME OF ARTHUR CALTHORPE WHEN HE CAME IN AND PRETEND HE WAS SOME ONE ELSE THAT'S BEEN PUZZLING ME TOO REPLIED JOYCE AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON BUT THE THING THAT CONFUSES ME MOST OF ALL ADDED CYNTHIA IS THIS
I AM GOING AWAY AND MRS DURAND SAID
AND WHEN I'D THOUGHT THIS OUT AN IDEA POPPED INTO MY HEAD
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT THREE LEFT AND THEY WON'T LAST MORE THAN A MINUTE OR TWO EVEN AS SHE SPOKE TWO OF THEM FLICKERED OUT
WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE TOGETHER AGAIN--FOR ALWAYS HE LEANED OVER PULLED HER HANDS FROM HER FACE AND KISSED HER TENDERLY
I THINK WE MUST HAVE SOME THINGS TO BE EXPLAINED THEY CAME FORWARD A LITTLE TIMIDLY AND THEIR LATEST VISITOR HELD OUT A HAND TO EACH
BUT AT INTERVALS I STILL FELT AN INEXPRESSIBLE LONGING TO SEE OR HEAR FROM MY MOTHER
YOU'D NEVER GUESS YOU KNOW THE CIVIL WAR HAD JUST BROKEN OUT,--FORT SUMTER HAD SURRENDERED AND MRS COLLINGWOOD WAS A SOUTH CAROLINA WOMAN AND WAS HEART AND SOUL WITH THE CONFEDERACY
THERE'S JUST ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ASK IF YOU DON'T MIND SAID CYNTHIA COMING SUDDENLY OUT OF A BROWN STUDY
AND I'D JUST AS LIEF NOT GET INTO THAT ROOM IF IT'S SO JOYCE BROKE INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHTER
PROBABLY SHE TURNED THE PORTRAIT AROUND AND TORE OUT THE MINIATURE WHEN SHE WAS ALONE
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT EVEN SO INSISTED CYNTHIA
AS MR AND MRS SPRAGUE WERE OCCUPYING THE SITTING-ROOM THE TWO GIRLS DECIDED TO WORK IN THE DINING-ROOM AND ACCORDINGLY SPREAD OUT THEIR BOOKS AND PAPERS ALL OVER THE BIG ROUND TABLE
IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN,--A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
SHE WAS MY MOTHER'S ONLY LIVING RELATIVE AND THE PAPER MENTIONED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE
HOPE SHE ISN'T REALLY OFFENDED
IT SEEMED VERY STRANGE
OVER THE LAWN AND THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE PICKET-FENCE OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE SPED GOLIATH HIS ENEMY YAPPING AT HIS HEELS AND INTO THE TANGLED THICKET OF BUSHES ABOUT THE NEARER WING
AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END
I LOCKED THE DOOR AND THREW THE KEY DOWN THE WELL--THAT NIGHT SHE ANSWERED SLOWLY
CYNTHIA PERCHED GINGERLY ON THE EDGE OF A RICKETY CHAIR NODDED A VIGOROUS ASSENT
IF YOU ARE THE SAME MR FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD WHO IN 1861 PARTED FROM YOUR MOTHER AFTER A DISAGREEMENT LEAVING A NOTE FOR HER WHICH YOU HOPED SHE WOULD READ I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT SHE NEVER SAW THAT NOTE
DO YOU WANT FOLKS TO SUSPECT WHAT WE ARE DOING AND PUT A STOP TO IT ALL
I NEVER PUT THE NAME OF THIS TOWN IN THE LETTER NOR MENTIONED THIS HOUSE
THE ROOM APPEARED TO BE IN CONSIDERABLE DISORDER AND ARTICLES OF CLOTHING BOOKS AND BOYISH BELONGINGS WERE TOSSED ABOUT AS IN A HURRY OF PACKING
THEN TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT WHICH WAS PLAINLY BECOMING EMBARRASSING TO HER CYNTHIA ABRUPTLY REMARKED
SHE WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK AND CARRIED ONLY A SMALL GRIP
DIDN'T YOU GUESS IT HOW COULD I HE ANSWERED
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHY OF COURSE SAID JOYCE
BUT WHO ARE THEY FATHER
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
THE OTHER BRIMMED WITH CLOTHING A WOMAN'S ALL FRILLS AND LACES AND SILKS
NOBODY'S BEEN HERE SINCE EXCEPT OURSELVES THAT'S PERFECTLY PLAIN
EITHER THE RELATIVE WAS DEAD OR HAD DONE SOMETHING AWFUL AND DISGRACEFUL
JOYCE CAME TO THE FRAY WITH AN OLD BROOM AND A DUST-CLOTH WHICH LATTER SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD CAREFULLY CONCEALED UNDER HER SWEATER
THEY HAD PLAYED HOUSE ON THE BROAD VERANDA CLIMBED THE TREES IN THE ORCHARD ORGANIZED ELABORATE GAMES OF HIDE-AND-SEEK AMONG THE THICK HIGH BUSHES THAT GREW SO CLOSE TO THE WALLS AND IN IDLE MOMENTS HAD TOLD EACH OTHER LONG STORIES ABOUT ITS FORMER IMAGINARY INMATES
NO IT'S THIS AND BEFORE CYNTHIA'S ASTONISHED EYES JOYCE DANGLED A LARGE GOLD LOCKET SUSPENDED ON A NARROW BLACK VELVET RIBBON
THE APARTMENT WAS A DINING-ROOM
I TELL YOU CYNTHIA IT HAUNTS ME
SO I SAT DOWN ONE DAY AND WROTE HER THE MOST LOVING PENITENT LETTER BEGGING ANEW FOR FORGIVENESS AND GIVING HER THE HISTORY OF MY ADVENTURES AND MY WHEREABOUTS
OUT ON THE STREET CYNTHIA SUDDENLY BEGAN
OH I COULD SIT HERE AND LOOK AT THIS FOR HOURS
AND MRS DURAND CRIED
AND WE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T MARRIED WELL SHE WAS,--AND WE'VE MADE SEVERAL MISTAKES BESIDE THAT CYNTHIA SPRAGUE AS YOU'LL FIND OUT LATER
WELL I'M LOWER YET--TEN CENTS TO LAST TILL THE MONTH'S OUT
AND SO THE GIRLS CONTINUED TO WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE SILENCE AND IN THE DARK
WHY I NEVER DREAMED THERE WAS SUCH A THING IN THE HOUSE SHE EXCLAIMED
THEN CAME THE SURPRISE
WILL YOU HEED A LESSON I HAVE LEARNED AND PAID FOR WITH THE BITTEREST YEARS OF MY LIFE
DID YOU NOTICE JOYCE SHE PRESENTLY REMARKED THAT THOSE TWO THINGS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE AND ALMOST THE SAME SIZE WHY SO THEY ARE EXCLAIMED JOYCE
THE QUEEREST CLICK
I'M WILD TO LOOK AT THE LOVELY LADY AGAIN
SOMEHOW I HAD IN MY MIND A PICTURE OF FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD THAT WAS AS DIFFERENT AS COULD BE FROM--WELL FROM WHAT HE IS
BUT IT'S THIS
MY MOTHER MY OWN MOTHER FORGIVE ME AND GOD KEEP YOU
WE'VE COME TO THE END OF OUR ROPE JOYCE SAT BACK ON HER HEELS SHE HAD BEEN RUMMAGING THROUGH A BOX OF OLD TRASH IN THE KITCHEN OF THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE AND WIPED HER GRIMY HANDS ON THE DUST-CLOTH
JOYCE FRANKLY AND OPENLY ENJOYED IT ALL BUT CYNTHIA SEEMED NERVOUS AND RESTLESS
HERE I AM AT THE TOP
SHE WILL NEVER ALLOW THIS OLD HOUSE TO BE TOUCHED NOR LET ANY ONE ENTER IT
SOME LARGE PAINTINGS AND PORTRAITS HUNG ON THE WALLS BUT THE CANDLE DID NOT THROW ENOUGH LIGHT TO PERMIT SEEING THEM WELL
WHAT IS IT AND WHY WAS IT THROWN IN THE FIRE
CONSEQUENTLY HE WOULDN'T BE LIKELY TO ALLOW IT TO BE SHUT UP FOREVER IN THIS QUEER WAY
THEY WERE CAUGHT AS IN A TRAP
THEY WERE CAUGHT AS IN A TRAP
FIRST YOU WON'T BE HIRED TO GO AND SEE HER AND THEN YOU WANT TO RUSH OFF AND DO IT AT ONCE
WHEN NOTHING MORE REMAINED SHE POKED THE FRAGMENTS DISGUSTEDLY WHILE CYNTHIA LOOKED ON
SOMETIME I'M GOING TO BUY ENOUGH WAX CANDLES TO FILL THAT WHOLE CHANDELIER--OR CANDELABRUM RATHER--AND WE'LL LIGHT IT JUST ONCE AND SEE HOW IT MAKES THINGS LOOK
I'LL WRITE TO HER TO-MORROW THAT WE'RE ALL COMING YOU AND MOTHER AND I OH BUT FATHER EXCLAIMED JOYCE
I CLOSED IT WHEN WE CAME UP SO HE COULDN'T HAVE GOT HERE AFTERWARD JOYCE BENT DOWN AND SCRATCHED GOLIATH'S FAT JOWLS AT WHICH HE PURRED THE LOUDER
I EVEN FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT SHE NEVER KNEW IT WAS HERE HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT OUT QUESTIONED CYNTHIA
IT MADE ME DREADFULLY NERVOUS AND THAT'S THE REASON I WAS SO CROSS TO YOU JOYCE I SUPPOSE
MINE GENERALLY AREN'T
PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN THEN I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT FOR IF HE DIDN'T DO IT WHO DID CYNTHIA DEFENDED HERSELF
BUT IF YOU ARE AS I WAS PRAY DAILY FOR HELP TO CURB THAT NATURE BEFORE YOU HAVE ALLOWED IT TO WORK SOME DESPERATE EVIL SHE HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
THIS LEFT A LONG SPACE ON THE SHELF FROM WHICH THEY CAME AND THE METHODICAL CYNTHIA PRESENTLY ROSE TO PUT THEM BACK
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT I'M ACTUALLY WORKING VERY HARD TO-NIGHT CYNTHIA OPENED HER ALGEBRA PICKED OUT THE PROBLEM AND READ
I HAD NO INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY
IT WILL NEVER DO FOR US TO BE FOUND HERE
BUT GREAT-AUNT LUCIA SAYS THAT THE SAME AFTERNOON AS THEY WERE DRIVING TO THE STATION THEY MET A SPLENDID YOUNG FELLOW WITH YELLOW HAIR AND BRIGHT BROWN EYES HURRYING ALONG THE ROAD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
ANNE NEVER ASKS WHAT I'M DOING SAID JOYCE RESIGNEDLY
IT WAS A WONDERFUL AND APPEALING SECRET THAT THEY SOMEHOW FELT WAS ALL THEIR OWN
AND FINISH EXPLORING
WHAT'S THE OLD PLACE TO YOU ANYHOW OH NOTHING--NOTHING AT ALL PROTESTED JOYCE ALARMED LEST THEIR PRECIOUS SECRET WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCOVERED
AND I--I DID NOT WANT TO RELENT
BUT BEYOND THIS THERE WAS NOTHING MUCH OUT OF THE ORDINARY ABOUT IT
OH CYN
I HAD ENOUGH
THEREFORE SHE PROBABLY NEVER CAME IN HERE
THEN SHE SHIVERED
THIS HOUSE WAS THE ONLY ONE AROUND FOR A LONG DISTANCE WELL THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING BUT EVEN STILL I DON'T SEE WHY YOU WANT TO GET INSIDE ANYHOW
DID YOU NEVER THINK OF IT I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU ASK ANSWERED MRS COLLINGWOOD FOR IT MUST HAVE SEEMED VERY STRANGE TO AN OUTSIDER
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LOCKED-UP ROOM INTERRUPTED CYNTHIA
WHAT FOR CRIED CYNTHIA
WE SAW HIM AND MRS COLLINGWOOD ANSWERED
THEY FELT THAT AT LAST THEY HAD TAKEN A LONG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY THUS IDENTIFYING THIS ROOM AS BELONGING TO THE LOVELY LADY OF THE PORTRAIT DOWN-STAIRS
PLEASE SHE BEGGED BREATHLESSLY
I LOVE OLD BOOKS
WHY IT'S GOLIATH OF COURSE LAUGHED CYNTHIA
I THINK WHAT HE DID WAS FINE YOU MUST REMEMBER SAID JOYCE THAT PEOPLE FELT SO DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SUCH THINGS IN THOSE DAYS
BY THE WAY JOYCE SHE SAID AS THEY STOOD ON THE PORCH SHAKING THE RAIN FROM THEIR SKIRTS WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE POINTING AT JUST WHEN THE CANDLE WENT OUT
BUT IT WAS ONLY GOLIATH DISTURBED IN HIS HIDING-PLACE
WE WILL COME HERE OFTEN AND EXAMINE EVERY BIT OF EVIDENCE WE CAN FIND AND GATHER INFORMATION OUTSIDE IF WE CAN AND PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND SEE IF WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE WHOLE STORY
THE PAPER WAS DATED SEVEN YEARS BEFORE
OH WELL!--IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THIS--THIS HOUSE HAS TAKEN HOLD OF ME--SOMEHOW
IT IS VERY WONDERFUL AND SO THEY BEGAN FIRST JOYCE AND THEN CYNTHIA,--INTERRUPTING AND SUPPLEMENTING EACH OTHER
WHAT EVER MADE YOU THINK OF IT
BUT IN SPITE OF THESE THINGS ITS HAUNTING STORY WAS NEVER OUT OF THEIR MINDS FOR LONG AND THEY DISCUSSED AND RE-DISCUSSED IT IN MANY A SPARE HOUR WHEN THEY CROUCHED COZILY BY THEMSELVES OVER THE OPEN FIRE DURING THAT LONG WINTER
I HOPE HE WILL COME EVERY TIME WE DO
BUT YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO HUNT SO I'VE TROTTED AROUND AFTER YOU AND SAID NOTHING MORE THAN THREE WEEKS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE FINDING OF THE OLD NEWSPAPER AND THE DEFINITE SETTLING OF THE DATE
DINNER IT WAS READY HALF AN HOUR AGO
BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN AT WORK VERY LONG THEY FOUND THAT THEY HAD LET THEMSELVES IN FOR A BIGGER TASK THAN THEY HAD DREAMED
CHAPTER XVI JOYCE EXPLAINS JOYCE WILL YOU JUST OBLIGE ME BY PINCHING ME--REAL HARD
INTO THE BUSHES ALSO PLUNGED BATES PUP AND THERE ENSUED THE SOUND OF SUNDRY BAFFLED YELPS
AND THE REST OF THE CANDLES WE'LL PUT IN THE LOCKED-UP ROOM LET'S GO RIGHT UP THERE NOW AND DUST IT OH WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LIGHT THAT ROOM FOR CRIED JOYCE
HE IS DEAD TO ME AND FOR THE LONGEST TIME MRS DURAND COULDN'T GET ANOTHER WORD FROM HER EXCEPT THAT SHE HAD SHUT UP THE HOUSE AND WAS GOING HOME SOUTH TO LIVE FOR GOOD
THAT WAS ONE REASON I WANTED TO HAVE OUR ILLUMINATION NEXT WEEK ON THE CHANCE OF THEIR ARRIVING
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND IF YOU ARE NOT AFFLICTED WITH A PASSIONATE TEMPER AS I WAS
I WAS ALWAYS VERY FOND OF HER
AND MY POCKET-MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
MY GUIDE RETURNED EMPTY-HANDED
HER HUSBAND SUPPOSING SHE HAD ONE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE OWNED THIS HOUSE
SHE PULLED THE SHUDDERING CYNTHIA OUT OF THE CLOSET AND FELT HER WAY ACROSS THE WIDE HALL SPACE
UPON EVERYTHING THE DUST WAS INDESCRIBABLY THICK AND COBWEBS HUNG FROM THE CEILING
BUT SHE LOOKED MUCH YOUNGER
MY NAME IS CALTHORPE,--BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
OR PERHAPS THE PERSON WAS RIGHT THERE AND DID SOMETHING THAT DISPLEASED HER,--I CAN'T TELL WHICH
AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME CYN CRIED JOYCE INSTANTLY DELIGHTED WITH THE NEW IDEA
JOYCE GAVE A START AND OPENED HER LIPS TO SPEAK BUT CYNTHIA WAS BEFORE HER
I WONDER WHAT CRIED CYNTHIA IMPATIENT AT THE LONG PAUSE
PERHAPS IT ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING
ONCE ON A DAY THAT WAS UNUSUALLY MILD THEY VENTURED INTO THE OLD HOUSE FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND LOOKED LONG AND INTENTLY AT THE LOVELY LADY OVER THE LIBRARY MANTEL AND AT THE TWO PRETTY CHILDREN IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SEE WHY THE STRANGEST THING WHISPERED JOYCE
WE'VE DISCOVERED A LOT HERE BUT I'VE A NOTION THAT WE'LL FIND THE BEST OF ALL IN THERE AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE ROOM GOLIATH WHO HAD CURLED HIMSELF UP ON A SOFT RUG BEFORE THE FIREPLACE ROSE STRETCHED HIMSELF YAWNED WIDELY AND PREPARED TO FOLLOW WHEREVER THEY LED
CYNTHIA HAD THOUGHTFULLY REQUESTED A TIN BISCUIT-BOX FROM THE GROCER AND IN THIS THEY PACKED THEIR CANDLES THUS PROTECTING THEM AGAINST THE RAVAGES OF MICE AND LEFT THEM IN THE CELLAR NEAR THE WINDOW
IT WAS JOYCE WHO HAD PULLED CYNTHIA AWAY FROM STARING WIDE-EYED AT THE SPECTACLE OF THAT MARVELOUS REUNION
IT IS AN ADVENTURE I SUPPOSE
IF YOU DON'T TEND TO THESE THINGS YOURSELF YOU GET SOME ONE ELSE TO DO IT FOR YOU
AND TEN CENTS MORE WILL BUY A WHOLE PACKAGE OF SAFETY-MATCHES
IT WAS FULL OF BLOSSOMS YESTERDAY JOYCE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
I HAVE AN IDEA CRIED JOYCE
THEN WE'LL HAVE THE ILLUMINATION FOR A TREAT SOMETIME AND I'LL BEGIN TO SAVE UP FOR IT
SO THEY SAT ON THIS THREATENING AFTERNOON CHEATED OF THEIR ANTICIPATED CANOE-TRIP ON THE LITTLE STREAM THAT THREADED ITS WAY THROUGH THEIR TOWN TO THE WIDE SOUND,--SAT MUNCHING SUGAR-COOKIES GLOWERING AT THE WEATHER AND THINKING OF NOTHING VERY SPECIAL
THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS
I CAN'T IMAGINE
AND THE ONLY PERIOD OF THE YEAR WHICH SAW THEM PARTED WAS THE FEW WEEKS DURING VACATION WHEN THEIR RESPECTIVE PARENTS WHO HAD DIFFERENT TASTES IN SUMMER RESORTS DRAGGED THEM UNWILLINGLY AWAY TO MOUNTAIN AND SEA-SHORE
AND IT'S HEAVY TOO
THAT IS--NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST--JUST TO-DAY OH
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED
EVEN THEIR BIRTHDAYS FELL IN THE SAME MONTH
THE BOARDED-UP HOUSE HAD ALWAYS BEEN BOARDED UP AS LONG AS ITS NEIGHBORS COULD RECOLLECT
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDS BUT IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS,--THAT AMONG THE PASSENGERS JUST ARRIVED IN NEW YORK ON THE CAMPANIA WAS MR FAIRFAX COLLINGWOOD WHO WAS INTERESTED IN WESTERN AND AUSTRALIAN GOLD MINES
IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF--THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE HE SAID HASTILY
DID YOU EVER SEE SO MUCH DUST SNATCHING THE CANDLES AGAIN THEY BOTH SPRANG FORWARD EXPECTING TO GAZE INTO THE DUSTY INTERIOR OF SOME LONG UNUSED CUPBOARD OR CLOSET
I WANTED THEM GOOD SHE SAID AND JOYCE COULD NOT BUDGE HER FROM THIS POSITION
ASHES OR WOOD WON'T MAKE THAT SOUND
SHE COULDN'T WRITE HER INQUIRIES,--THAT CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER DO
THAT'S SO SHE AGREED
AND WHEN I CAME TO THE OLD PIANO THE IMPULSE SEIZED ME TO PLAY A FEW BARS AND HUM THE LINES OF A LITTLE SONG I HAD ONCE COMPOSED FOR MY MOTHER
SHE NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN
NONE OF US KNEW NO WE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T CONTINUED CYNTHIA
YOU'D BE FAR MORE LIKELY TO KEEP THE PICTURE ALWAYS NEAR SO THAT YOU COULD LOOK AT IT OFTEN
GET THE DUST-RAG ORDERED JOYCE
ISN'T THAT SO OF COURSE ASSENTED CYNTHIA
WHAT'S QUEER ABOUT THAT
I THINK I DID
SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED-UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MRS COLLINGWOOD
I BELIEVE THEY MUST HAVE SEEN THESE LIGHTS THROUGH SOME CHINK IN THE BOARDING AND ARE BREAKING IN TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE MATTER
MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE SAW THE STRANGE PAIR GAZE FOR ONE LONG MOMENT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
I HARDLY DARED TO HOPE IT WOULD BE SO
H
H
H
OR HE MAY EVEN HAVE HAD ANOTHER COPY CYNTHIA ADDED IN A PRACTICAL AFTER-THOUGHT
IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME HOWEVER THE FLOOR BEHIND THEM WAS LITTERED WITH VOLUMES HASTILY DEPOSITED AND THE SHELVES FOR A SPACE NEARLY AS HIGH AS THEIR HEADS WERE REMOVED
WELL WHEN I SAW THE NOTICE OF MY OWN DEATH IN THE PAPER MY FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENY IT AT ONCE
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD SCHEME TO GET THE OLDER FOLKS TO TALK ABOUT THIS HOUSE WITHOUT LETTING THEM KNOW YOU HAVE ANY SPECIAL INTEREST IN IT--JUST START THE SUBJECT SOMEHOW
THERE WAS A DISTINCTLY OLD-FASHIONED DIFFERENT AIR ABOUT THE PLACE BUT NOTHING IN ANY OTHER WAY REMARKABLE
AND ONE OF THEM YOU MUST ADMIT WAS OUR LOVELY LADY WHOSE PORTRAIT HANGS IN THE LIBRARY
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE DOOR OPENED ON A TINY NARROW STAIRWAY ASCENDING INTO THE DIMNESS ABOVE
WHY IF YOU HAD WRITTEN THAT NOTE AND HAD AN IDEA THAT HE WAS ALIVE WERE YOU SO TREMENDOUSLY ASTONISHED WHEN HE AND HIS MOTHER RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER
THEN SHE GAVE A LONG LOW WHISTLE
THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER
HERE THE OWNER OF THE RED SWEATER CRAMMED A HANDFUL OF HOT COOKIES INTO CYNTHIA'S POCKET
BUT FIRST I MUST TELL YOU THAT MRS COLLINGWOOD HAD A SON WHAT GASPED CYNTHIA STARING UP AT THE GIRLISH PICTURE
WHEN MY SON--WHEN FAIRFAX HERE--HAD GONE AND I WAS SHUTTING UP THE HOUSE AND CAME TO HIS ROOM,--I WANTED TO GO IN,--OH YOU CANNOT KNOW HOW I WANTED TO GO IN
I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME
AT ANY RATE I HAD NO WISH TO REVIVE THE BITTERNESS OF THAT MEMORY
I COULDN'T
DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE--THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE
THERE WAS NO NEED OF FURTHER EXPLANATION
BUT JOYCE HAPPENED TO BE IN ONE OF HER FLY-AWAY HUMORS SO CYNTHIA ALWAYS CALLED THEM WHEN SHE FOUND IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCENTRATE HER THOUGHTS OR GIVE HER SERIOUS ATTENTION TO ANYTHING
I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE--VERY WELL INDEED--AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION
IT HUNG THERE WITH ITS FACE TURNED TO THE WALL CHAPTER III AMATEUR DETECTIVES WHILE CYNTHIA WAS BENDING OVER HER DESK DURING STUDY-HOUR STRUGGLING WITH A HOPELESSLY ENTANGLED ACCOUNT IN LATIN OF CAESAR AND HIS GALLIC WARS HER NEXT NEIGHBOR THRUST A NOTE INTO HER HAND
JOYCE LAUGHED PLACED HER COMPANION'S FEET ON A LEDGE AND HAULED HER DOWN BREATHLESS COBWEBBY AND THOROUGHLY SCARED
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WE FOUND THE DOOR AT THE HEAD OF THE CELLAR STEPS OPEN
I'LL LEAD FATHER ROUND TO TALKING OF HER THIS EVENING IF I CAN AND SEE WHAT COMES OF IT JOYCE WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD
WHEN THE SURGEONS DID ARRIVE WE WERE REMOVED TO DIFFERENT ARMY HOSPITALS AND I NEVER SAW THE MAN AGAIN
WITH THIS HOPE IN MIND THEY WENT FROM ROOM TO ROOM SEARCHING ON DESKS CHAIRS AND TABLES POKING INTO DARK CORNERS PEEPING INTO VASES AND OTHER SUCH RECEPTACLES AND FEELING ABOUT UNDER THE FURNITURE
HE WAS VERY MUCH MOVED
IT'S ALL SO DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN WHAT'S THAT EXCLAIMED CYNTHIA SUDDENLY AND JOYCE STRAIGHTENED UP TO LISTEN MORE INTENTLY
JOYCE DID QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND LAUGHED HYSTERICALLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
IN THE CENTER OF THIS WAS A CURIOUS SMEAR OF VARIOUS DIM COLORS
I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO THAT FOR ARGUED CYNTHIA
I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS
I'D ALMOST BEGUN TO BE--ANGRY JOY HER RIGHT NAME WAS JOYCE IGNORED THE LATTER REMARK
AFTER LUNCH WE'LL GO BACK TO THE B
I FOUND THAT I STILL FELT THE LURE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND THE LESS EXPLORED OR INHABITED THE BETTER
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THIS FOR ANOTHER DAY GROANED JOYCE AT LAST
ANGLE A EQUALS ANGLE B ANGEL A EQUALS ANGEL B MURMURED JOYCE AFTER HER
IN ALL HER LIFE SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO BEAUTIFUL AN OLD LADY
HERE'S THE WAY IT ALL SEEMS TO ME
FOR AUGHT I KNEW IT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HANDS TWENTY TIMES SINCE WE LIVED THERE
I BELIEVED THAT I HAD BROKEN FOREVER WITH MY HOME
COME INTO THE LIBRARY SAID JOYCE
BUT MRS COLLINGWOOD I'M SO AFRAID WE HAVEN'T DONE RIGHT,--THAT WE MEDDLED IN WHAT WAS NO BUSINESS OF OURS AND TRESPASSED IN A HOUSE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU SHE REITERATED
FOR MANY YEARS SHE HAD NOT LEFT HER HOME AND THE FAMILY SELDOM SAW HER
MY HEART IS BEATING LIKE A TRIP-HAMMER
THE DOORS OF SEVERAL BEDROOMS STOOD OPEN
WE ARE TRESPASSERS AND MEDDLERS AND I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE US THE DEAREST LITTLE MEDDLERS IN THE WORLD CRIED MRS COLLINGWOOD
THEY FELT THAT THEY MUST LOOK FOR SOME MORE DEFINITE CLUE
YOU KNOW CYN I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE PLACE CAREFULLY FROM THE OUTSIDE
THEY HAD NO SOONER PUT THEIR HEADS INTO THE OPENING THAN THEY STARTED BACK WITH A SIMULTANEOUS CRY
IS THAT MRS COLLINGWOOD COMING DOWN CHAPTER XV THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MRS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP-STAIRS,--SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME--THEY KNEW NOT WHAT
I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY
MERCY
THERE WAS A PARTY HERE LONG LONG AGO,--PERHAPS A DINNER-PARTY
YOU ARE DRESSED IN MOURNING YES SAID MRS COLLINGWOOD
THAT'S POSITIVELY ALL AND YOU SEE EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED NO IT ISN'T RETORTED CYNTHIA
CYNTHIA SCOWLED
BUT--WHY OF COURSE
I'M TIRED AND SICK OF THIS DUSTY GRUBBING AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY MORE OF IT NEXT MORNING JOYCE CAME FLYING OVER TO CYNTHIA'S HOUSE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO START FOR HIGH SCHOOL
IT LAY RIGHT THERE FOR HER TO SEE HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THIS ROOM BEING LOCKED PARRIED JOYCE ANSWERING THE QUESTION YANKEE FASHION BY ASKING ANOTHER
NEVER MIND THE CANDLES
THIS WAY SHE ORDERED AND THEY MOVED TOWARD IT CAUTIOUSLY
WHY THIS REPEATED JOYCE WITH GREAT GRAVITY
CYNTHIA WAS FOR GOING OVER IT AGAIN
AND DON'T LET ANY ONE SEE WHAT YOU TAKE BUT THIS CYNTHIA FLATLY REFUSED TO DO URGING THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY BE DISCOVERED AND HELD UP FOR INSTANT EXPLANATION BY THE LYNX-EYED BRIDGET WHO GUARDED THE KITCHEN
THERE WAS NO ESCAPE NOW
THE MYSTERIOUS LOCKED ROOM WAS AT LAST TO YIELD UP ITS SECRET TO THEM
BUT THE MATCH WENT OUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE DOOR
AND A SECOND AFTER CYNTHIA FINISHED IT YIELDED WITH ANOTHER LOUD CRACK
WHEREVER DID IT COME FROM THEY ALL TURNED TOWARD THE DOOR
IT SO CARRIED ME BACK INTO MY YOUTH THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS I QUITE LOST TRACK OF THE PRESENT
COME ON URGED JOYCE
I HANDED THEM TO YOU
THAT'S THE FIRST RIGHT GUESS YOU'VE MADE RETORTED JOYCE GOOD-NATUREDLY AS SHE GLANCED ABOUT
WHAT ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR HYDRANGEA BUSH
THE NEXT INSTANT THE ROOM WAS IN TOTAL DARKNESS
I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE--AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
MUCH TO JOYCE'S AMAZEMENT CYNTHIA INSISTED ON INVESTING IN THE BEST WAX ONES SHE COULD OBTAIN THOUGH THEY COST NEARLY FIVE CENTS APIECE
THERE IT IS AGAIN
HE'LL BE SORT OF COMPANY SO GOLIATH WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN AND THE TWO GIRLS ESCORTED BY HIM PROCEEDED ON THEIR VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY
THEN SUDDENLY BUT OH I WISH I'D KNOWN THIS ALL AT THE TIME WHAT FOR
THERE WAS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THIS ROOM TO INDICATE THAT ANY STRANGE HAPPENING HAD TRANSPIRED HERE
WHY CYNTHIA WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
WHAT SHALL WE DO CYNTHIA MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED AT HER LITTLE SILVER WATCH
NOW WILL YOU BELIEVE ME TRULY CYNTHIA COULD NO LONGER DOUBT
JUST SEE HERE,--THE BIG HEADLINES--'FORT SUMTER SURRENDERS
WHAT DO YOU SAY AS USUAL YOU'VE THOUGHT OF JUST THE THING TO DO
THIS ISN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING
