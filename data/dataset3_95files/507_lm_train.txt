WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW AND ADAM WAS A STRAPPING LAD OF FIFTEEN AND TAUGHT ME CARPENTERING I USED TO THINK IF EVER I WAS A RICH SULTAN I WOULD MAKE ADAM MY GRAND-VIZIER
OUR FRIEND ARTHUR LIKED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WAS HANDSOME AND TO HAVE HIS HANDSOME DEEDS RECOGNIZED
THERE'S NO AMENDS I CAN MAKE YE LAD--THE MORE'S THE PITY
YES SAID ADAM PLEASED TO HAVE HER ASK A QUESTION ABOUT HIMSELF
THERE'S NOBODY BUT GOD CAN CONTROL THE HEART OF MAN
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL OVER AGAIN WHAT I FELT WHEN I'D KNOCKED HIM DOWN
HETTY WAS NOT MADE UNHAPPY
WE DO NOT HEAR THAT MEMNON'S STATUE GAVE FORTH ITS MELODY AT ALL UNDER THE RUSHING OF THE MIGHTIEST WIND OR IN RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER INFLUENCE DIVINE OR HUMAN THAN CERTAIN SHORT-LIVED SUNBEAMS OF MORNING
ONE CAN PUT UP WITH ANNOYANCES IN THE HOUSE BUT TO HAVE THE STABLE MADE A SCENE OF VEXATION AND DISGUST IS A POINT BEYOND WHAT HUMAN FLESH AND BLOOD CAN BE EXPECTED TO ENDURE LONG TOGETHER WITHOUT DANGER OF MISANTHROPY
BUT THERE'S FOLKS UD HOLD A SIEVE UNDER THE PUMP AND EXPECT TO CARRY AWAY THE WATER THAT DIFFICULTY--ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING--YOU WILL NOT HAVE MRS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MRS POYSER'S PART
THE LOAMSHIRE MILITIA'S GONE TO IRELAND
AND DINAH SAID YES DEAR FRIEND YOUR AFFLICTION IS GREAT
HE ONLY SAID I MAY TELL YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT MAYN'T I HETTY AND SHE SAID YES THE RED FIRE-LIGHT ON THE HEARTH AT THE HALL FARM SHONE ON JOYFUL FACES THAT EVENING WHEN HETTY WAS GONE UPSTAIRS AND ADAM TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF TELLING MR AND MRS POYSER AND THE GRANDFATHER THAT HE SAW HIS WAY TO MAINTAINING A WIFE NOW AND THAT HETTY HAD CONSENTED TO HAVE HIM
WIRY BEN HAD LEFT A SCREW HALF DRIVEN IN AND THROWN HIS SCREWDRIVER INTO HIS TOOL-BASKET
BUT AFTERWARDS THE OTHER PEOPLE MUST KNOW AND SHE COULD NO MORE RUSH ON THAT SHAME THAN SHE COULD RUSH ON DEATH
IT IS TRUE KESTER'S KNEES WERE MUCH BENT OUTWARD BY THIS TIME AND HE WALKED WITH A PERPETUAL CURTSY AS IF HE WERE AMONG THE MOST REVERENT OF MEN
HE HELD IT NO VIRTUE TO FROWN AT IRREMEDIABLE FAULTS
THE OLD SQUIRE BEFORE SITTING DOWN WALKED ROUND THE HALL TO GREET THE TENANTS AND MAKE POLITE SPEECHES TO THE WIVES
FOR AT THE DANCE THIS EVENING SHE WAS NOT TO WEAR ANY NECKERCHIEF AND SHE HAD BEEN BUSY YESTERDAY WITH HER SPOTTED PINK-AND-WHITE FROCK THAT SHE MIGHT MAKE THE SLEEVES EITHER LONG OR SHORT AT WILL
SHE'LL NEVER LOVE ANY MAN AS A HUSBAND--THAT'S MY BELIEF NAY LAD THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT A FAT CHILD THAT IS SHE IS HOLDING ON HER KNEE
THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE
I WENT IN AND IT WAS HALF FULL O TRUSSES OF STRAW AND THERE WAS SOME HAY TOO
IF THE CHAFF-CUTTER HAD THE MAKING OF US WE SHOULD ALL BE STRAW I RECKON
HIS MOTHER AND THE KITCHEN HAD VANISHED FOR HIM AND HE SAW NOTHING BUT DINAH'S FACE TURNED UP TOWARDS HIS
BUT IF YOU DO ANYTHING DISGRACEFUL I'LL DISOWN YOU--MIND THAT MADAM MIND THAT CHAPTER XLI THE EVE OF THE TRIAL AN UPPER ROOM IN A DULL STONITON STREET WITH TWO BEDS IN IT--ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR
IT'S ALL VERY FINE TO LOOK ON AND GRIN REJOINED MRS POYSER
BUT TAKE THY BONNET OFF AN LET ME LOOK AT THEE DINAH WAS MOVING AWAY BUT LISBETH HELD HER FAST WHILE SHE WAS TAKING OFF HER BONNET AND LOOKED AT HER FACE AS ONE LOOKS INTO A NEWLY GATHERED SNOWDROP TO RENEW THE OLD IMPRESSIONS OF PURITY AND GENTLENESS
ADAM HEARD THE WATER GENTLY DRIPPING FROM THE PUMP--THAT WAS THE ONLY SOUND--AND HE KNOCKED AT THE HOUSE DOOR RATHER SOFTLY AS WAS SUITABLE IN THAT STILLNESS
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE--WHETHER WE LIVE OR DIE WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD OH DINAH WON'T NOBODY DO ANYTHING FOR ME
I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY WAY FOR THE LAST TWENTY MINUTES TO HAVE A LOOK AT THAT PLACE IN THE VALLEY
YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MRS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR--FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY
TROUBLE'S MADE US KIN AYE LAD SAID MARTIN
THERE IS NO NEED FOR OUR SEEING EACH OTHER AGAIN NOW
SEE SHE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO THE LEFT WITH HER EYES FIXED ON A POINT ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE
IT WAS ALREADY FIVE DAYS SINCE SHE HAD LEFT WINDSOR FOR SHE HAD WANDERED ABOUT ALWAYS AVOIDING SPEECH OR QUESTIONING LOOKS AND RECOVERING HER AIR OF PROUD SELF-DEPENDENCE WHENEVER SHE WAS UNDER OBSERVATION CHOOSING HER DECENT LODGING AT NIGHT AND DRESSING HERSELF NEATLY IN THE MORNING AND SETTING OFF ON HER WAY STEADILY OR REMAINING UNDER SHELTER IF IT RAINED AS IF SHE HAD A HAPPY LIFE TO CHERISH
FOR HE WISHED TO AVOID GOING TO THE HALL FARM NEAR BREAKFAST-TIME WHEN THE CHILDREN AND SERVANTS WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE-PLACE AND THERE MUST BE EXCLAMATIONS IN THEIR HEARING ABOUT HIS HAVING RETURNED WITHOUT HETTY
VILLAGERS NEVER SWARM
IF YOU TRUST A MAN LET HIM BE A BACHELOR--LET HIM BE A BACHELOR WELL THEN IT WAS SO FAR SETTLED YESTERDAY THAT I'M TO TAKE THE MANAGEMENT O THE WOODS
NO MAN CAN BE WISE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH
I'VE BEEN THINKING I'D BETTER HAVE ASKED FOR A LANTHORN NO NO
I AM NOT ASHAMED OF COMMEMORATING OLD KESTER
MY GRANDFATHER HAS GIVEN ME CARTE BLANCHE FOR ONCE AND I PROMISE YOU THE ENTERTAINMENT SHALL BE WORTHY OF THE OCCASION
WE'LL NOT TALK ABOUT BUSINESS TILL WE'VE HAD OUR SUPPER
IF THERE WERE ANY BITTERNESS IN HIS NATURE IT COULD ONLY SHOW ITSELF AGAINST THE MAN WHO REFUSED TO BE CONCILIATED BY HIM
SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN I LEFT HER WHO WAS IT TOOK THE NEWS TO THE HALL FARM SAID ADAM HIS THOUGHTS REVERTING TO SOME ONE THERE
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS FORCED UPON ME I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST THING I COULD DO
ADAM WENT ON PRESENTLY WITH HIS PLEADING AND YOU CAN DO ALMOST AS MUCH AS YOU DO NOW
ADAM DID NOT JOIN IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THERE WAS A SLIGHT SMILE ON HIS FACE AS HE SAID IN A GENTLER TONE THAN BEFORE WHY THEE'ST FORGOT THE PANELS THE LAUGHTER BURST OUT AFRESH AS SETH CLAPPED HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD AND COLOURED OVER BROW AND CROWN
IF YOU'LL JUST HELP ME ON THEY WALKED SLOWLY WITH FREQUENT PAUSES BUT WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN
LORD BLESS YOU SIR--IF YOU'LL HEXCUSE ME FOR SAYING SO--HE CAN WALK FORTY MILE A-DAY AN LIFT A MATTER O SIXTY STON HE'S AN UNCOMMON FAVOURITE WI THE GENTRY SIR
SETH WAS SURPRISED AND THOUGHT SOMETHING UNUSUAL MUST HAVE HAPPENED BUT WHEN ADAM CAME UP HIS FACE SAID PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT IT WAS NOTHING ALARMING
IT'S A TYPE OF FACE ONE RARELY SEES AMONG OUR COMMON PEOPLE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE YOUNG WOMAN DAUPHIN SAID MRS IRWINE
SHE USED NEVER TO MAKE ANY RETURN TO MY AFFECTION BEFORE BUT NOW TRIBULATION HAS OPENED HER HEART
THE DOOR OPENED AND DINAH STOOD BEFORE HIM COLOURING DEEPLY WITH THE GREAT SURPRISE OF SEEING ADAM AT THIS HOUR WHEN SHE KNEW IT WAS HIS REGULAR PRACTICE TO BE AT CHURCH
I KNOW HE MEANS TO LEAVE ME ALL THE MONEY HE HAS SAVED AND HE IS LIKELY ENOUGH TO HAVE CUT OFF POOR AUNT LYDIA WHO HAS BEEN A SLAVE TO HIM ALL HER LIFE WITH ONLY FIVE HUNDRED A-YEAR FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING ME ALL THE MORE
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN SOME SIPS ADAM SAID HADN'T I BETTER RUN TO TH HOUSE SIR AND GET SOME MORE BRANDY
HER FACE WAS ALL THE MORE TOUCHING IN ITS YOUTH AND BEAUTY BECAUSE OF ITS WEARY LOOK AND THE GOOD WOMAN'S EYES PRESENTLY WANDERED TO HER FIGURE WHICH IN HER HURRIED DRESSING ON HER JOURNEY SHE HAD TAKEN NO PAINS TO CONCEAL
FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE KEENEST OF BUCOLIC MINDS FELT A WHISPERING AWE AT THE SIGHT OF THE GENTRY SUCH AS OF OLD MEN FELT WHEN THEY STOOD ON TIPTOE TO WATCH THE GODS PASSING BY IN TALL HUMAN SHAPE
CHAPTER LIII THE HARVEST SUPPER AS ADAM WAS GOING HOMEWARD ON WEDNESDAY EVENING IN THE SIX O'CLOCK SUNLIGHT HE SAW IN THE DISTANCE THE LAST LOAD OF BARLEY WINDING ITS WAY TOWARDS THE YARD-GATE OF THE HALL FARM AND HEARD THE CHANT OF HARVEST HOME RISING AND SINKING LIKE A WAVE
SETH FELT THIS DIMLY
PERHAPS THEY WERE THE REASON WHY WHEN HE OPENED THE OLD GREEN GATE LEADING INTO THE GROVE HE PAUSED TO PAT GYP AND SAY A KIND WORD TO HIM
I'LL GO AND WASH MYSELF NOW ADAM MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE WORKSHOP BUT AFTER A STEP OR TWO HE TURNED ROUND AND MEETING SETH'S EYES WITH A CALM SAD GLANCE HE SAID I MUST TAKE ALL THE MONEY OUT O THE TIN BOX LAD
THE WOMAN WAS RESCUED AND TAKEN TO THE PARISH
BUT A DREADFUL BLOW'S COME UPON ME MR IRWINE STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AS IF INVOLUNTARILY BUT THEN DETERMINED TO CONTROL HIMSELF WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
PERHAPS HE ONLY MADE THE WORLD FOR THE GREAT AND THE WISE AND THE RICH
IT WAS REDDENED NOW AND WET WITH TEARS
THAT IS NOT A REASON STRONG ENOUGH AGAINST A COURSE THAT IS REALLY MORE GENEROUS MORE UNSELFISH THAN THE OTHER
MOTHER HE SAID GRAVELY THEE'T TALKING WILD
BUT HIS NATURE WAS TOO ARDENT AND TENDER FOR HIM NOT TO SUFFER AT THIS PARTING
AND ADAM WHO KNEW HALF THEIR SECRET WOULD RATHER HELP THEM TO KEEP IT THAN BETRAY IT
COME IN SAID A WOMAN'S VOICE AND HE ENTERED A ROOM SO DARKENED BY BLINDS AND CURTAINS THAT MISS KATE THE THIN MIDDLE-AGED LADY STANDING BY THE BEDSIDE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD LIGHT ENOUGH FOR ANY OTHER SORT OF WORK THAN THE KNITTING WHICH LAY ON THE LITTLE TABLE NEAR HER
IT IS NOT LIKE THE RICHES OF THIS WORLD SO THAT THE MORE ONE GETS THE LESS THE REST CAN HAVE
I HADN'T GOT FAR OUT OF THE ROAD INTO ONE OF THE OPEN PLACES BEFORE I HEARD A STRANGE CRY
I BEGAN TO THINK I MIGHT MAKE SOME MONEY OF IT IF IT WAS A NEW THING
BUT NO LORD NOR LADY CAN BE SO HAPPY AS ME IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT THE LOVE OF GOD IN THEIR SOULS
THE SOONER SHE WENT THE BETTER SINCE THE WEATHER WAS PLEASANT NOW
ONE CAN SAY EVERYTHING BEST OVER A MEAL
AND HETTY MUST BE ONE OF THEM
THEE WUTNA GO UPSTAIRS AN SEE THY FEYTHER THEN
I SHOULD NEVER LIKE TO GO INTO THE GREEN FIELDS AGAIN--I HATED EM SO IN MY MISERY HETTY PAUSED AGAIN AS IF THE SENSE OF THE PAST WERE TOO STRONG UPON HER FOR WORDS
MARY WAS A GOOD GIRL NOT GIVEN TO INDULGE IN EVIL FEELINGS BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT SINCE HETTY HAD A BAD TEMPER IT WAS BETTER ADAM SHOULD KNOW IT
SHE FELT NOTHING WHEN HIS EYES RESTED ON HER BUT THE COLD TRIUMPH OF KNOWING THAT HE LOVED HER AND WOULD NOT CARE TO LOOK AT MARY BURGE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINFUL TO ENTER THIS PLACE IF THEIR PREVIOUS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN LESS PAINFUL
THE EXERCISE AND THE OCCUPATION OF FINDING THE STILE WERE A STIMULUS TO HER HOWEVER AND LIGHTENED THE HORROR OF THE DARKNESS AND SOLITUDE
HER HANDS WERE COLD AS DEATH BETWEEN ADAM'S
AND TIES US BY OUR HEART-STRINGS TO THE BEINGS THAT JAR US AT EVERY MOVEMENT
OF COURSE THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WISHED ARTHUR TO KNOW EARLIER THAN IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SEE EACH OTHER
FARTHER ON THERE IS A CLUMP OF TREES ON THE LOW GROUND AND SHE IS MAKING HER WAY TOWARDS IT
TOO HAPPY THAT SHE SMILED AT HIM--STILL HAPPIER BECAUSE HE OBSERVED IN HER A MORE SUBDUED AIR SOMETHING THAT HE INTERPRETED AS THE GROWTH OF WOMANLY TENDERNESS AND SERIOUSNESS
ARTHUR TOLD HIMSELF HE DID NOT DESERVE THAT THINGS SHOULD TURN OUT BADLY
THEY ALL MOVED ASIDE AND STOOD WITH THEIR HATS OFF WHILE MR IRWINE PASSED
THEY KNOW THE RIGHTS OF A STORY BEFORE THEY HEAR IT AND CAN TELL A MAN WHAT HIS THOUGHTS ARE BEFORE HE KNOWS EM HIMSELF LIKE ENOUGH SAID MRS POYSER FOR THE MEN ARE MOSTLY SO SLOW THEIR THOUGHTS OVERRUN EM AN THEY CAN ONLY CATCH EM BY THE TAIL
WHEN SHE HEARD THE CHURCH DOOR SWINGING HER HEART BEAT SO SHE DARED NOT LOOK UP
THEE SHOULDST HA TOLD HER TO BRING OUR JUG UP FIRST TOLD HER SAID MRS POYSER
SHE ROSE AND LISTENED BUT ALL WAS QUIET AFTERWARDS AND SHE REFLECTED THAT HETTY MIGHT MERELY HAVE KNOCKED SOMETHING DOWN IN GETTING INTO BED
SHE PUSHED HER AWAY IMPATIENTLY AND SAID WITH A CHILDISH SOBBING VOICE DON'T TALK TO ME SO DINAH
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE NOTWITHSTANDING APPEARANCES TO THE CONTRARY THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY
MRS IRWINE AND HER DAUGHTERS WERE WAITING AT THE CHURCHYARD GATES IN THEIR CARRIAGE FOR THEY HAD A CARRIAGE NOW TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM AND WISH THEM WELL
HE HAD NEVER YET SPOKEN TO HER OR STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH HER AND HER FIRST THOUGHT AS HER EYES MET HIS WAS WHAT A WELL-FAVOURED COUNTENANCE
THE WAY HE ROLLED FROM A RICH DEEP FORTE INTO A MELANCHOLY CADENCE SUBSIDING AT THE END OF THE LAST WORD INTO A SORT OF FAINT RESONANCE LIKE THE LINGERING VIBRATIONS OF A FINE VIOLONCELLO I CAN COMPARE TO NOTHING FOR ITS STRONG CALM MELANCHOLY BUT THE RUSH AND CADENCE OF THE WIND AMONG THE AUTUMN BOUGHS
BUT THAT'S NOTHING TO MAKE A FUSS ABOUT
SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS SHE SEEMED AS STUPID TO CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE AS LUKE BRITTON DID TO HER
CHAPTER XIX ADAM ON A WORKING DAY NOTWITHSTANDING MR CRAIG'S PROPHECY THE DARK-BLUE CLOUD DISPERSED ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING PRODUCED THE THREATENED CONSEQUENCES
I DIDN'T GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE ROAD BUT TURNED OFF TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND TOOK A SHORTER WAY TOWARDS THE SPOT I WANTED TO GET TO
BUT THE HEART OF MAN IS THE SAME EVERYWHERE AND THERE ARE THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD AND THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT THERE AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE
HE'D BE GLAD T HA YE TO SUPPER WI'M I'LL BE'S WARRAND NO DOLLY THANK YOU
GYP JUMPED AND GAVE A SHORT BARK AS MUCH AS TO SAY OF COURSE POOR FELLOW HE HAD NOT A GREAT RANGE OF EXPRESSION
I HOPE SHE ISN'T ALTERED HE SAID I REMEMBER HER FACE SO WELL I TOLD HIM NO ADAM CONTINUED LOOKING FONDLY AT THE EYES THAT WERE TURNED TOWARDS HIS ONLY A BIT PLUMPER AS THEE'DST A RIGHT TO BE AFTER SEVEN YEAR
GET ME THE MATCHES DOWN HETTY FOR I MUST HAVE THE RUSHLIGHT BURNING I MY ROOM
AT LEAST I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE IN BROXTON AND HAYSLOPE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SORRY TO PART WITH THEIR CLERGYMAN AND THAT MOST FACES BRIGHTENED AT HIS APPROACH
THE NEWS THAT BONY WAS COME BACK FROM EGYPT WAS COMPARATIVELY INSIPID AND THE REPULSE OF THE FRENCH IN ITALY WAS NOTHING TO MRS POYSER'S REPULSE OF THE OLD SQUIRE
SHE CAN ONLY FEEL HER HEART IS HARD AND SHE IS HELPLESS
FOR WHEN MEN WANT TO IMPRESS US WITH THE EFFECT OF A NEW AND WONDERFULLY VIVID LIGHT DO THEY NOT LET IT FALL ON THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS THAT WE MAY MEASURE ITS INTENSITY BY REMEMBERING THE FORMER DIMNESS
PERHAPS YOU WILL EVEN NOW COME BACK WITH ME I CAN'T ADAM SAID
I COULD HIT OUT BETTER THAN MOST MEN AT OXFORD AND YET I BELIEVE YOU WOULD KNOCK ME INTO NEXT WEEK IF I WERE TO HAVE A BATTLE WITH YOU GOD FORBID I SHOULD EVER DO THAT SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING ROUND AT ARTHUR AND SMILING
SHE'LL NO MORE GO ON IN HER NEW WAYS WITHOUT YOU THAN A DOG ULL STAND ON ITS HIND-LEGS WHEN THERE'S NOBODY LOOKING
NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MR CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER
I SHOULD BE NO BETTER THAN A COWARD TO GO AWAY AND LEAVE THE TROUBLES TO BE BORNE BY THEM AS AREN'T HALF SO ABLE
BUT I MADE A BOW AND SAID NO THANK YOU MADAM
HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF COLOURING AND WAS ANNOYED AT HIS BOYISHNESS
AS SOON AS HETTY HAD DETERMINED ON THIS SCHEME SHE ROSE FROM THE GRASSY BANK OF THE POOL TOOK UP HER BASKET AND WENT ON HER WAY TO TREDDLESTON FOR SHE MUST BUY THE WEDDING THINGS SHE HAD COME OUT FOR THOUGH SHE WOULD NEVER WANT THEM
WHEN HE SAW THE LITTLE THING AGAIN AS SHE REALLY WAS AS ADAM'S WIFE AT WORK QUITE PROSAICALLY IN HER NEW HOME HE SHOULD PERHAPS WONDER AT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS PAST FEELINGS
HETTY'S LOVE OF FINERY WAS JUST THE THING THAT WOULD MOST PROVOKE HIS MOTHER AND HE HIMSELF DISLIKED IT AS MUCH AS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DISLIKE ANYTHING THAT BELONGED TO HER
IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL
AND OF COURSE CLOSE TO MRS POYSER STOOD HETTY AND ADAM WAS AGAIN BEGUILED FROM CALCULATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES INTO DREAMS AND HOPES
AT ALL EVENTS HE COULDN'T HELP WHAT WOULD COME NOW
HE'S A FINE FELLOW AND I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT I THINK SO A DRAMA IN WHICH FRIEND ARTHUR PIQUES HIMSELF ON HAVING A PRETTY PART TO PLAY SAID MR IRWINE SMILING
IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE HOPED THAT MARTIN POYSER COULD ESCAPE THE PAIN OF BEING CALLED AS A WITNESS AND IT WAS BETTER HE SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING AS LONG BEFOREHAND AS POSSIBLE
TELL THEM I'M GONE--GONE TO STONITON HE SAID IN A MUFFLED TONE OF AGITATION--SPRANG INTO THE SADDLE AND SET OFF AT A GALLOP
IT IS QUENCHED IN THINE
SHE HAD EVEN TAKEN OUT HER SMALL ROUND EAR-RINGS WHICH SHE WORE EVERY DAY
HUMAN CONVERSE I THINK SOME WISE MAN HAS REMARKED IS NOT RIGIDLY SINCERE
A TERRIBLE WOMAN!--MADE OF NEEDLES MADE OF NEEDLES
NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO--O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
HERE TOTTY MY CHICKEN LET MOTHER PUT YOUR BONNET ON AND THEN YOU GO OUT INTO THE RICK-YARD AND SEE IF FATHER'S THERE AND TELL HIM HE MUSTN'T GO AWAY AGAIN WITHOUT COMING T HAVE A CUP O TEA
THE ANXIETIES AND FEARS OF A FIRST PASSION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREMBLING HAD BECOME STRONGER THAN VANITY HAD GIVEN HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT SENSE OF HELPLESS DEPENDENCE ON ANOTHER'S FEELING WHICH AWAKENS THE CLINGING DEPRECATING WOMANHOOD EVEN IN THE SHALLOWEST GIRL THAT CAN EVER EXPERIENCE IT AND CREATES IN HER A SENSIBILITY TO KINDNESS WHICH FOUND HER QUITE HARD BEFORE
YES I MIGHT SPEND ALL THE WIND I MY BODY AN TAKE THE BELLOWS TOO IF I WAS TO TELL THEM GELLS EVERYTHING AS THEIR OWN SHARPNESS WONNA TELL EM
BUT WE'VE MANY MORE METHODISTS THERE THAN IN THIS COUNTRY WELL I DIDNA KNOW AS THE METHODY WOMEN WAR LIKE YE FOR THERE'S WILL MASKERY'S WIFE AS THEY SAY'S A BIG METHODY ISNA PLEASANT TO LOOK AT AT ALL
HE GAVE ONE RAPID GLANCE AT HIS BROTHER BUT ADAM WAS EVIDENTLY QUITE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT OF EMOTION THAT HAD SHAKEN DINAH
NO ONE CAN KNOW BUT MYSELF WHAT ARE MY INWARD NEEDS AND THE BESETMENTS I AM MOST IN DANGER FROM
WHAT WOULD IT HA SIGNIFIED--MY HAVING A BIT O TROUBLE WITH HER
HE LOOKED NEITHER AWKWARD NOR EMBARRASSED BUT STOOD IN HIS USUAL FIRM UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN A LITTLE BACKWARD AND HIS HANDS PERFECTLY STILL IN THAT ROUGH DIGNITY WHICH IS PECULIAR TO INTELLIGENT HONEST WELL-BUILT WORKMEN WHO ARE NEVER WONDERING WHAT IS THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WORLD
THEY STILL HELD EACH OTHER'S HANDS AND THERE WAS LONG SILENCE
HOW BEAUTIFUL HER EYES WERE WITH THE TEAR ON THEIR LASHES
ALL STONITON HAD HEARD OF DINAH MORRIS THE YOUNG METHODIST WOMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE OBSTINATE CRIMINAL TO CONFESS AND THERE WAS AS MUCH EAGERNESS TO SEE HER AS TO SEE THE WRETCHED HETTY
SHE CRIED HARDLY KNOWING WHY
BUT GODWIN INSISTS ON MY KEEPING IT UP CONSTANTLY FOR SOME TIME TO COME
IT WAS PRETTY WELL TALKED OVER I CAN TELL YOU AT CASSON'S AND ONE AND ANOTHER HAD THEIR FLING AT YOU
THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED YET
BEAUTY HAS AN EXPRESSION BEYOND AND FAR ABOVE THE ONE WOMAN'S SOUL THAT IT CLOTHES AS THE WORDS OF GENIUS HAVE A WIDER MEANING THAN THE THOUGHT THAT PROMPTED THEM
YOU GO WHISTLING ABOUT AND TAKE NO MORE CARE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF THAN IF YOUR HEADS WERE GUTTERS FOR ANY RUBBISH TO SWILL THROUGH THAT HAPPENED TO BE IN THE WAY
THERE WAS A SORT OF IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT HE WAS REALLY SUCH A GOOD FELLOW AT BOTTOM PROVIDENCE WOULD NOT TREAT HIM HARSHLY
PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY TREMBLING AND NERVOUS THAT THE APPARITION HAD SO STRONG AN EFFECT ON HER
NO WONDER THE SECRET ESCAPES THE UNSYMPATHIZING OBSERVER WHO MIGHT AS WELL PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES TO DISCERN ODOURS
SUCH THINGS ARE SOMETIMES HIDDEN AMONG THE SUNNY FIELDS AND BEHIND THE BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS
MISS ANNE INDEED IF HER CHRONIC HEADACHES COULD HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR BY A PATHETIC STORY OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME ROMANTIC INTEREST ATTACHED TO HER
I KNOW ADAM BEDE WELL--I KNOW WHAT HE IS AS A WORKMAN AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN AS A SON AND BROTHER--AND I AM SAYING THE SIMPLEST TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I RESPECT HIM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT ANY MAN LIVING
SHE WAS HAPPY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS LONG DAY AND WISHED THAT DANCE WOULD LAST FOR HOURS
AND I'M NOT AGAIN IT--MARK MY WORDS--I'M NOT AGAIN IT
IT'S THE SAME LESSON YOU READ LAST WEEK YOU KNOW BILL WAS A STURDY FELLOW AGED FOUR-AND-TWENTY AN EXCELLENT STONE-SAWYER WHO COULD GET AS GOOD WAGES AS ANY MAN IN THE TRADE OF HIS YEARS
YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MRS POYSER
WHO IS THAT TALL YOUNG MAN DAUPHIN WITH THE MILD FACE
WHILE ARTHUR GAZED INTO HETTY'S DARK BESEECHING EYES IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHAT SORT OF ENGLISH SHE SPOKE
WOULD HE LOOK AT HER
HE GOES TWICE WHERE HE USED T GO ONCE
BUT NOW DINAH BEGAN TO TELL OF THE JOYS THAT WERE IN STORE FOR THE PENITENT AND TO DESCRIBE IN HER SIMPLE WAY THE DIVINE PEACE AND LOVE WITH WHICH THE SOUL OF THE BELIEVER IS FILLED--HOW THE SENSE OF GOD'S LOVE TURNS POVERTY INTO RICHES AND SATISFIES THE SOUL SO THAT NO UNEASY DESIRE VEXES IT NO FEAR ALARMS IT
IF YOU HAD BEEN A PUNY WIRY YELLOW BABY I WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD GODMOTHER TO YOU
THE EARLY DAYS OF GLOOM AT THE HALL FARM HAD BEEN GRADUALLY TURNED INTO SOFT MOONLIGHT BY HER PRESENCE
SO THAT BY THE TIME ADAM HAD GOT INTO THE CHASE AND WAS STRIDING ALONG WITH THE BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER THE SUN WAS ON THE POINT OF SETTING AND WAS SENDING LEVEL CRIMSON RAYS AMONG THE GREAT TRUNKS OF THE OLD OAKS AND TOUCHING EVERY BARE PATCH OF GROUND WITH A TRANSIENT GLORY THAT MADE IT LOOK LIKE A JEWEL DROPT UPON THE GRASS
IT UD HA BEEN BETTER LUCK IF THEY'D HA BURIED HIM I THE FORENOON WHEN THE RAIN WAS FALLIN
HE HAD NEVER YET CONFESSED HIS SECRET TO ADAM BUT NOW HE FELT A DELICIOUS SENSE OF DISBURDENMENT AS HE ANSWERED AYE ADDY I DO LOVE HER--TOO MUCH I DOUBT
I SEE CLEAR ENOUGH THERE'S MORE PRIDE NOR LOVE IN MY SOUL FOR I COULD SOONER MAKE A THOUSAND STROKES WITH TH HAMMER FOR MY FATHER THAN BRING MYSELF TO SAY A KIND WORD TO HIM
THE OLD SQUIRE'S FUNERAL HAD TAKEN PLACE THAT MORNING THE WILL HAD BEEN READ AND NOW IN THE FIRST BREATHING-SPACE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE HAD COME OUT FOR A LONELY WALK THAT HE MIGHT LOOK FIXEDLY AT THE NEW FUTURE BEFORE HIM AND CONFIRM HIMSELF IN A SAD RESOLUTION
CHAD AND THE ROUGHER SORT OF WORKMEN KEPT ALOOF FROM THE GRAVE UNDER THE WHITE THORN WHERE THE BURIAL WAS GOING FORWARD
COME SHALL I GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE NO MOTHER I SHALL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE NOW IT'S CLEARING UP
WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
COULDN'T YOU GET MORE OUT OF HIS SERMONS THAN OUT OF MR IRWINE'S EH I KNOWNA
FOR THE LAMBS WERE GOT RID OF SOONER OR LATER
AND I WALKED FAST TILL I GOT INTO A STREET A GOOD WAY OFF AND THERE WAS A PUBLIC AND I GOT SOME WARM STUFF TO DRINK AND SOME BREAD
I WISH I COULD MAKE THEE AMENDS THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MARTIN POYSER'S THROAT AT THAT MOMENT WHICH CAUSED HIM TO BRING OUT THOSE SCANTY WORDS IN RATHER A BROKEN FASHION
AN UGLY PIGGISH OR FISHY EYE NOW MAKES ME FEEL QUITE ILL
NOW THAT'S THE WAY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE WOMEN
CONFESS THE WICKEDNESS YOU HAVE DONE--THE SIN YOU HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF AGAINST YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER
THEN THERE HAD BEEN THE WORK OF CLEANSING TO THE STRICTEST PURITY EVERY OBJECT IN THE SACRED CHAMBER AND OF REMOVING FROM IT EVERY TRACE OF COMMON DAILY OCCUPATION
THERE WAS TO BE A GRAND DINNER FOR THE NEIGHBOURING GENTRY ON THE MORROW BUT TO-DAY ALL THE FORCES WERE REQUIRED FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE TENANTS
YES SAID DINAH RESUMING HER WORK SHE SEEMED GREATLY COMFORTED AFTER A WHILE AND SHE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF REST IN THE NIGHT BY TIMES
WHAT A GLAD WORLD THIS LOOKS LIKE AS ONE DRIVES OR RIDES ALONG THE VALLEYS AND OVER THE HILLS
FOOLISH THOUGHTS
AND TELL HIM HETTY SAID IN RATHER A STRONGER VOICE TELL HIM...FOR THERE'S NOBODY ELSE TO TELL HIM...AS I WENT AFTER HIM AND COULDN'T FIND HIM...AND I HATED HIM AND CURSED HIM ONCE...BUT DINAH SAYS I SHOULD FORGIVE HIM...AND I TRY...FOR ELSE GOD WON'T FORGIVE ME THERE WAS A NOISE AT THE DOOR OF THE CELL NOW--THE KEY WAS BEING TURNED IN THE LOCK AND WHEN THE DOOR OPENED ADAM SAW INDISTINCTLY THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL FACES THERE
WHAT A TIME O NIGHT THIS IS TO COME HOME HETTY SAID MRS POYSER
HOW DO YOU DO ADAM BEDE SAID DINAH IN HER CALM TREBLE PAUSING FROM HER SWEEPING AND FIXING HER MILD GRAVE EYES UPON HIM
OUR DEAD ARE NEVER DEAD TO US UNTIL WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM
HE WAS BUT TWENTY-ONE YOU REMEMBER AND WE DON'T INQUIRE TOO CLOSELY INTO CHARACTER IN THE CASE OF A HANDSOME GENEROUS YOUNG FELLOW WHO WILL HAVE PROPERTY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT NUMEROUS PECCADILLOES--WHO IF HE SHOULD UNFORTUNATELY BREAK A MAN'S LEGS IN HIS RASH DRIVING WILL BE ABLE TO PENSION HIM HANDSOMELY
HE WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING EASY TO HIMSELF
AND CARROLL WHO KEPT HIS EARS OPEN TO ALL THAT PASSED AT THE RECTORY HAD FRAMED AN INFERENTIAL VERSION OF THE STORY AND FOUND EARLY OPPORTUNITIES OF COMMUNICATING IT
FOR HER SHORT POISONOUS DELIGHTS HAD SPOILED FOR EVER ALL THE LITTLE JOYS THAT HAD ONCE MADE THE SWEETNESS OF HER LIFE--THE NEW FROCK READY FOR TREDDLESTON FAIR THE PARTY AT MR BRITTON'S AT BROXTON WAKE THE BEAUX THAT SHE WOULD SAY NO TO FOR A LONG WHILE AND THE PROSPECT OF THE WEDDING THAT WAS TO COME AT LAST WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE A SILK GOWN AND A GREAT MANY CLOTHES ALL AT ONCE
THE POYSERS TOO--HARDLY THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED BUT HE FELT THE NEED OF SEEING THEM AND INTERCHANGING WORDS AND LOOKS OF FRIENDLINESS WITH THEM
HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIMSELF IRRITATED MORTIFIED
ALL THE FORCE OF HER NATURE HAD BEEN CONCENTRATED ON THE ONE EFFORT OF CONCEALMENT AND SHE HAD SHRUNK WITH IRRESISTIBLE DREAD FROM EVERY COURSE THAT COULD TEND TOWARDS A BETRAYAL OF HER MISERABLE SECRET
IT IS TIGHTENING ITS CLASP
THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE-STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS--THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY--HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ADAM FEEL THAT HE WAS IN A GREAT TEMPLE AND THAT THE DISTANT CHANT WAS A SACRED SONG
HETTY WAS QUITE USED TO THE THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE LIKED TO LOOK AT HER
AT THE SAME TIME TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF HER MOMENTARY LEISURE TO PUT HER FINGERS INTO A BOWL OF STARCH AND DRAG IT DOWN SO AS TO EMPTY THE CONTENTS WITH TOLERABLE COMPLETENESS ON TO THE IRONING SHEET
I TRUSTED AS THE STRONG LOVE GOD HAS GIVEN ME TOWARDS YOU WAS A LEADING FOR US BOTH
WELL MR POYSER HE SAID BEFORE THE GOOD SLOW FARMER HAD TIME TO SPEAK YE'LL NOT BE CARRYING YOUR HAY TO-MORROW I'M THINKING
BUT MY AUNT WAS VERY KIND WANTING ME TO HAVE REST FROM MY WORK THERE BECAUSE I'D BEEN ILL AND SHE INVITED ME TO COME AND STAY WITH HER FOR A WHILE AH I REMEMBER SNOWFIELD VERY WELL
HE ONLY LOOKED FROM HIS WIFE TO DINAH WHO HAD NOW SEATED HERSELF BESIDE TOTTY AS A BULWARK AGAINST BROTHERLY PLAYFULNESS AND WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH THE CHILDREN'S TEA
YET SHE PUT HER HANDS UP TO HER EARS
THE DOG'S PATTERING STEP WAS A SURE SIGN THAT IT WAS ADAM WHO WENT DOWN
THAT WORD OF MR IRWINE'S--THAT HE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD FELT AFTER GIVING THE LAST BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE--HAD REMAINED WITH HIM
BUT--BUT HETTY MIGHT HAVE HAD THE TROUBLE IN SOME OTHER WAY IF NOT IN THIS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO ENTER INTO ANY SERVICE EVEN IF SHE COULD OBTAIN IT
YOU'RE MY OWN NIECE AND I WOULDN'T HAVE YOU GO TO SERVICE THOUGH IT WAS A GENTLEMAN'S HOUSE AS LONG AS I'VE GOT A HOME FOR YOU MR POYSER PAUSED AND PUFFED AWAY AT HIS PIPE
I RECKON HE'LL BE BACK AGAIN AFORE MANY DAYS ARE O'ER FOR HE'S TO BE AT ALL TH ARRANGING AND PREPARING O THINGS FOR THE COMIN O AGE O THE 30TH O JULY
AN HE WAR TO DIE AN ME NOT TO KNOW BUT TO BE A-SLEEPIN I MY BED AS IF I CAREDNA NOUGHT ABOUT IT
THE PRETTY CREATURE ARCHED HER BAY NECK IN THE SUNSHINE AND PAWED THE GRAVEL AND TREMBLED WITH PLEASURE WHEN HER MASTER STROKED HER NOSE AND PATTED HER AND TALKED TO HER EVEN IN A MORE CARESSING TONE THAN USUAL
BUT HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT BE HASTY--HE WOULD NOT TRY HETTY'S FEELING FOR HIM UNTIL IT HAD HAD TIME TO GROW STRONG AND FIRM
AND THE WOMEN HE OBSERVED COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING BUT PUT FINGER IN EYE AT A WEDDING
THE CONVERSATION MIGHT LEAD UP TO IT
PERHAPS THAT'S THE REASON THEY CAN SEE SO LITTLE O THIS SIDE ON'T MARTIN POYSER SHOOK WITH DELIGHTED LAUGHTER AND WINKED AT ADAM AS MUCH AS TO SAY THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS IN FOR IT NOW
SHE KEEPS PUTTING HER LEGS UP SO AND MESSING MY FROCK WHAT'S THE MATTER WI THE CHILD
THE CAPTAIN WAS THOUGHT TO BE VERY FULL OF HIS JOKES AND WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE THROUGHOUT THE ESTATE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FREE MANNERS
THERE WAS A FEEBLE DAWN IN THE ROOM WHEN HETTY AWOKE A LITTLE AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK WITH A SENSE OF DULL MISERY THE CAUSE OF WHICH BROKE UPON HER GRADUALLY AS SHE BEGAN TO DISCERN THE OBJECTS ROUND HER IN THE DIM LIGHT
AND THIS BLANK IN HETTY'S NATURE INSTEAD OF EXCITING DINAH'S DISLIKE ONLY TOUCHED HER WITH A DEEPER PITY
SHE HAD ONLY BEEN VERY TIRED AND OVERCOME WITH HER JOURNEY FOR SHE HAD COME A LONG WAY TO ASK ABOUT HER BROTHER WHO HAD RUN AWAY AND THEY THOUGHT HE WAS GONE FOR A SOLDIER AND CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE MIGHT KNOW FOR HE HAD BEEN VERY KIND TO HER BROTHER ONCE
HE WAITED UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK NINE BEFORE HE LEFT THE WORK-YARD AT THE VILLAGE AND SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELDS TOWARDS THE FARM
AND HER HEART SEEMED INCLINED TOWARDS ME LAST NIGHT AH THEN SHE'S SURE TO WANT YOU TO-DAY
ALL THE LOVELIEST FLOWERS ARE GONE
BUT IN SO COMPLEX A THING AS HUMAN NATURE WE MUST CONSIDER IT IS HARD TO FIND RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS
HIS HEART SWELLED AGREEABLY AS HE SAID WELL MILLS HOW IS MY AUNT BUT NOW MR BYGATE THE LAWYER WHO HAD BEEN IN THE HOUSE EVER SINCE THE DEATH CAME FORWARD TO GIVE DEFERENTIAL GREETINGS AND ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS AND ARTHUR WALKED WITH HIM TOWARDS THE LIBRARY WHERE HIS AUNT LYDIA WAS EXPECTING HIM
NOW THEN MY BOY DRAW UP DRAW UP
AND ON HETTY'S ACCOUNT HE WAS FILLED WITH UNEASINESS
I AM A WIDOW AND KEEP A SMALL SHOP LICENSED TO SELL TOBACCO SNUFF AND TEA IN CHURCH LANE STONITON
THE THOUGHT OF DINAH URGED ITSELF MORE STRONGLY NOW SINCE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NIGHT HAD DRIVEN HER SHUDDERING IMAGINATION AWAY FROM THE POOL
AND I'D NEVER BE THE HUSBAND TO MAKE A CLAIM ON YOU AS COULD INTERFERE WITH YOUR DOING THE WORK GOD HAS FITTED YOU FOR
HERE SOME MEASUREMENT WAS TO BE TAKEN WHICH REQUIRED MORE CONCENTRATED ATTENTION AND THE SONOROUS VOICE SUBSIDED INTO A LOW WHISTLE
I SHOULD HA KNOWN HIM ANYWHERE
I'M NO READER O THE PAPER MYSELF HE OBSERVED TO-NIGHT AS HE FILLED HIS PIPE THOUGH I MIGHT READ IT FAST ENOUGH IF I LIKED FOR THERE'S MISS LYDDY HAS EM AND S DONE WITH EM I NO TIME
POOR FELLOW
YES I DO WANT SOMETHING DONE
AS TO WHAT HE SHOULD DO BEYOND THAT HE HAD COME TO TWO DISTINCT RESOLUTIONS AMIDST THE TUMULT OF THOUGHT AND FEELING WHICH WAS GOING ON WITHIN HIM WHILE HE WENT TO AND FRO
THE YEARNING MEMORIES THE BITTER REGRET THE AGONIZED SYMPATHY THE STRUGGLING APPEALS TO THE INVISIBLE RIGHT--ALL THE INTENSE EMOTIONS WHICH HAD FILLED THE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THE PAST WEEK AND WERE COMPRESSING THEMSELVES AGAIN LIKE AN EAGER CROWD INTO THE HOURS OF THIS SINGLE MORNING MADE ADAM LOOK BACK ON ALL THE PREVIOUS YEARS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A DIM SLEEPY EXISTENCE AND HE HAD ONLY NOW AWAKED TO FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
I'M NOT ONE O THOSE AS CAN SEE THE CAT I THE DAIRY AN WONDER WHAT SHE'S COME AFTER THEE NEVER SAIDST A WORD TO ME ABOUT IT WELL I AREN'T LIKE A BIRD-CLAPPER FORCED TO MAKE A RATTLE WHEN THE WIND BLOWS ON ME
THE EYES AND TEETH WERE SET
FOR HE WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO BEN'S INVITATION BUT BLUSHED AND LAUGHED AND RUBBED HIS SLEEVE OVER HIS MOUTH IN A WAY THAT WAS REGARDED AS A SYMPTOM OF YIELDING
ME DOT MY NEKLACE ON
AND YET HE WAS DOMINATED AS ONE WHO FEELS HIMSELF IN THE WRONG ALWAYS IS BY THE MAN WHOSE GOOD OPINION HE CARES FOR
AND BY THE TIME SHE ROSE FROM HER KNEES MECHANICALLY BECAUSE ALL THE REST WERE RISING THE COLOUR HAD RETURNED TO HER CHEEKS EVEN WITH A HEIGHTENED GLOW FOR SHE WAS FRAMING LITTLE INDIGNANT SPEECHES TO HERSELF SAYING SHE HATED ARTHUR FOR GIVING HER THIS PAIN--SHE WOULD LIKE HIM TO SUFFER TOO
EH
EH
EH
EH
EH
WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF AND HE THOUGHT THAT AS DINAH HAD GONE SO EARLY SHE WOULD PERHAPS ALREADY BE NEAR RETURNING
IT SEEMED A VERY SHORT WALK THE TEN MILES TO OAKBOURNE THAT PRETTY TOWN WITHIN SIGHT OF THE BLUE HILLS WHERE HE BREAK-FASTED
I DIDNA FIND HETTY AT SNOWFIELD MR POYSER'S GOOD-NATURED FACE SHOWED SIGNS OF TROUBLED ASTONISHMENT
STILL THAT WAS THE ONLY GLASS SHE HAD IN WHICH SHE COULD SEE HER NECK AND ARMS FOR THE SMALL HANGING GLASS SHE HAD FETCHED OUT OF THE NEXT ROOM--THE ROOM THAT HAD BEEN DINAH'S--WOULD SHOW HER NOTHING BELOW HER LITTLE CHIN
HE COULD NOT HELP A LITTLE SHUDDER AS HE REMEMBERED HOW OFTEN HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM OF JUST SUCH A SOUND COMING AS A SIGN WHEN SOME ONE WAS DYING
HIS EYES HAD FOLLOWED HER EAGERLY TO-NIGHT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF AND HAD TAKEN IN DEEPER DRAUGHTS OF LOVE
PLEASANT AS A SUDDEN RUSH OF WARM AIR IN WINTER OR THE FLASH OF FIRELIGHT IN THE CHILL DUSK
YES SAID MRS POYSER AND SO WOULD ANYBODY ELSE HA THOUGHT AS HAD GOT THEIR RIGHT END UP'ARDS
BUT SHE DOESNA LOVE ME LAD ONLY AS ONE CHILD O GOD LOVES ANOTHER
HOWEVER THAT SAYING'S PARTLY TRUE
AND IF IT HAD BEEN ORDERED SO THAT YOU COULD HA BEEN MY SISTER AND LIVED WITH US ALL OUR LIVES I SHOULD HA COUNTED IT THE GREATEST BLESSING AS COULD HAPPEN TO US NOW
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD HER UNCLE'S NAME THERE SEEMED TO GO A SHIVER RIGHT THROUGH HER
I AM SORRY TO SAY MORE THAN HALF THE CHERRIES THAT FELL WERE HARD AND YELLOW INSTEAD OF JUICY AND RED
ARTHUR HAD PROCURED SOME RELIEF TO HIMSELF BY THROWING THE DECISION ON ADAM WITH A WARNING
WHAT'S TH MATTER WI THEE NOTHING TO MIND ABOUT MOTHER
PERHAPS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT MUCH THE LESS BECAUSE HETTY FELT VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE WHILE
THAT WAS HIS THOUGHT AS HE SUGARED HIS COFFEE
HE CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY BUT THE MISERY AND TERROR HIS MOTHER HAD GONE THROUGH IN THOSE TWO DAYS HAD HAUNTED HER EVER SINCE
THE WALLS YOU SEE ARE NEW AND NOT YET PAINTED
FOR IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF MEMORY THE THOUGHT OF HER ALWAYS CAME AS THE FIRST RAY OF RETURNING COMFORT
HE'D GOT NOTHING ELSE TO THINK ON THE SCOTCH TUNES SAID BARTLE MASSEY CONTEMPTUOUSLY
SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
OLD HARRY DOESNA WAG HIS TAIL SO FOR NOTHIN MR POYSER HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER FOR NOW ARTHUR CAME UP AND SAID MRS POYSER I'M COME TO REQUEST THE FAVOUR OF YOUR HAND FOR THE FIRST DANCE
HETTY HAD BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE GOT INTO A WRONG VEHICLE FROM OAKBOURNE
I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO IF I HAD BEEN A BETTER FELLOW THAN I AM
A MAN SHOULD MAKE SACRIFICES TO KEEP CLEAR OF DOING A WRONG
LIFE NOW BY THE MORNING LIGHT WITH THE IMPRESSION OF THAT MAN'S HARD WONDERING LOOK AT HER WAS AS FULL OF DREAD AS DEATH--IT WAS WORSE
DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
IT MAKES ME MAD TO THINK ON'T
THERE WAS NO NEED TO HURRY--THERE WAS ALL THE NIGHT TO DROWN HERSELF IN
NEVERTHELESS HE PROFFERED VARIOUS CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES
I DIDN'T SPEAK AT RANDOM--YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MY WAY
BUT I TRUST THAT IN THE WORST CASE WE MAY OBTAIN A PARDON FOR THE SAKE OF THE INNOCENT WHO ARE INVOLVED STUFF AND NONSENSE SAID BARTLE FORGETTING IN HIS IRRITATION TO WHOM HE WAS SPEAKING
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE HANDS YOU A BILL BY WHICH SHE GAINS AS HIGH A PERCENTAGE AS POSSIBLE
I'LL CARRY EM HOME THE BUILDINGS OF THE CHASE FARM LAY AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE CHASE AT ABOUT TEN MINUTES WALKING DISTANCE FROM THE ABBEY
SHE'S QUITE ORIGINAL IN HER TALK TOO
BUT BOTH SETH AND HIS MOTHER WERE BREATHING REGULARLY
BUT FOR A FARMER LIKE LUKE BRITTON FOR EXAMPLE WHOSE FALLOWS WERE NOT WELL CLEANED WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE RUDIMENTS OF HEDGING AND DITCHING AND SHOWED BUT A SMALL SHARE OF JUDGMENT IN THE PURCHASE OF WINTER STOCK MARTIN POYSER WAS AS HARD AND IMPLACABLE AS THE NORTH-EAST WIND
YOU LITTLE FRIGHTENED BIRD
CAN YOU DRINK A DROP OUT O YOUR HAND SIR SAID ADAM KNEELING DOWN AGAIN TO LIFT UP ARTHUR'S HEAD
WELL YOUNGSTER MUST I TAKE YOU HE SAID TRYING TO SMILE WHEN ADDY STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS--READY WITH THE USUAL BASENESS OF INFANCY TO GIVE UP HIS UNCLE SETH AT ONCE NOW THERE WAS SOME RARER PATRONAGE AT HAND
THERE IS SUCH A SWEET BABYLIKE ROUNDNESS ABOUT HER FACE AND FIGURE
AH DEAR FRIENDS WE ARE IN SAD WANT OF GOOD NEWS ABOUT GOD
BUT I HAD FELT NO CALL TO PREACH FOR WHEN I'M NOT GREATLY WROUGHT UPON I'M TOO MUCH GIVEN TO SIT STILL AND KEEP BY MYSELF
NOT AS I'M A-DICTATIN TO YOU SIR
A STEEL PURSE WITH HER ONE SHILLING IN IT
FORGIVE ME AND TRY TO FORGET EVERYTHING ABOUT ME EXCEPT THAT I SHALL BE AS LONG AS I LIVE YOUR AFFECTIONATE FRIEND ARTHUR DONNITHORNE SLOWLY HETTY HAD READ THIS LETTER
IT'S LIKE BREAKING YOUR WORD WELLY FOR YOUR AUNT NEVER HAD NO THOUGHT BUT YOU'D MAKE THIS YOUR HOME NAY UNCLE SAID DINAH TRYING TO BE QUITE CALM
DINAH HE SAID SUDDENLY TAKING BOTH HER HANDS BETWEEN HIS I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL
SO WHEN HE WAS ENOUGH MASTER OF HIMSELF TO TALK HE SAID I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR UNCLE SOME NEWS THAT'LL SURPRISE HIM HETTY
I THOUGHT SHE'D GIVEN UP THE NOTION O GOING BACK TO HER OLD COUNTRY THOUGHT
SHE THOUGHT OF THE STRUGGLES AND THE WEARINESS THAT MIGHT LIE BEFORE THEM IN THE REST OF THEIR LIFE'S JOURNEY WHEN SHE WOULD BE AWAY FROM THEM AND KNOW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS BEFALLING THEM
BUT AT THIS SEASON I AM IN HEAVINESS THROUGH MANIFOLD TEMPTATIONS
IF EVER SHE BEHAVED WITH COLD VANITY TOWARDS HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS ONLY BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LOVE ME WELL ENOUGH
AS I SAY TO POYSER IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT A FULL CROP O WHEAT OR A PASTURE WITH A FINE DAIRY O COWS IN IT
BUT NO SUCH STORY HAD EITHER BEEN KNOWN OR INVENTED CONCERNING HER AND THE GENERAL IMPRESSION WAS QUITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACT THAT BOTH THE SISTERS WERE OLD MAIDS FOR THE PROSAIC REASON THAT THEY HAD NEVER RECEIVED AN ELIGIBLE OFFER
YOU'VE GOT A JEST-BOOK HAN'T YOU AS YOU'RE RARE AND PROUD ON
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED LIKE THIS PLACE
ONLY IT WAS A LITTLE COTTAGE FATHER'S WAS AND NOT A BIG RAMBLING HOUSE AS GETS DIRTY I ONE CORNER AS FAST AS YOU CLEAN IT IN ANOTHER--BUT FOR ALL THAT I COULD FANCY YOU WAS YOUR AUNT JUDITH ONLY HER HAIR WAS A DEAL DARKER THAN YOURS AND SHE WAS STOUTER AND BROADER I THE SHOULDERS
YOUR CHEEKS WILL BE SHRIVELLED ONE DAY YOUR HAIR WILL BE GREY YOUR POOR BODY WILL BE THIN AND TOTTERING
AND CLOSE AT HAND CAME THE VILLAGE
THE WIFE THOUGHT SHE WOULD COAX THE GOOD MAN INTO LETTING HER KEEP THEM
HUMAN FEELING IS LIKE THE MIGHTY RIVERS THAT BLESS THE EARTH
IT WAS THE LAST WEAKNESS HE MEANT TO INDULGE IN
HE THOUGHT SHE BEHAVED SO PRETTILY SO QUIETLY
YE CANNA MAKE THE SMART LESS WI TALKIN YE'LL NE'ER MAKE ME BELIEVE AS IT'S BETTER FOR ME NOT TO HA MY OLD MAN DIE IN'S BED IF HE MUST DIE AN HA THE PARSON TO PRAY BY HIM AN ME TO SIT BY HIM AN TELL HIM NE'ER TO MIND TH ILL WORDS I'VE GI'EN HIM SOMETIMES WHEN I WAR ANGERED AN TO GI HIM A BIT AN A SUP AS LONG AS A BIT AN A SUP HE'D SWALLOW
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF THAT WAS HEAVEN WHERE THERE'S ALWAYS JOY AND SUNSHINE THOUGH THIS LIFE'S DARK AND CLOUDY OH I LOVE THE STONYSHIRE SIDE SAID DINAH
AN THY MOTHER MAY'S WELL GO ARTER HIM--THE SOONER THE BETTER--FOR I'M NO GOOD TO NOBODY NOW
MR POYSER HE KNEW WOULD LIKE IT BETTER THAN A FIVE-POUND NOTE AND HE SHOULD SEE IF HETTY'S EYES BRIGHTENED AT IT
SHE GOT UP WHEN SHE SAW ME AND SEEMED AS IF SHE'D BE WALKING ON THE OTHER WAY
BUT I MUST PLAY THE AMIABLE OLD GENTLEMAN FOR ONCE AND SECOND YOUR TOAST IN HONOUR OF ADAM
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THINGS FOLKS CALL WRONG
THE WORD GENTLEMAN HAD A SPELL FOR ADAM AND AS HE OFTEN SAID HE COULDN'T ABIDE A FELLOW WHO THOUGHT HE MADE HIMSELF FINE BY BEING COXY TO'S BETTERS I MUST REMIND YOU AGAIN THAT ADAM HAD THE BLOOD OF THE PEASANT IN HIS VEINS AND THAT SINCE HE WAS IN HIS PRIME HALF A CENTURY AGO YOU MUST EXPECT SOME OF HIS CHARACTERISTICS TO BE OBSOLETE
SHE'S BEEN SPEAKING WITH POWER THIS FORENOON FROM THE WORDS I CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS BUT SINNERS TO REPENTANCE AND THERE WAS A LITTLE THING HAPPENED AS WAS PRETTY TO SEE
IT WAS ENTIRELY OWING TO THIS DEFICIENCY IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS THAT ARTHUR HAD EVER BROUGHT ANY ONE INTO TROUBLE BESIDES HIMSELF
AND WHEN I'D PUT IT THERE I THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE SOMEBODY TO FIND IT AND SAVE IT FROM DYING
THE CHURCHYARD WALK WAS QUITE LINED WITH FAMILIAR FACES MANY OF THEM FACES THAT HAD FIRST LOOKED AT DINAH WHEN SHE PREACHED ON THE GREEN
RUN INTO THE HOUSE WITH EM TO MOTHER--SHE WANTS YOU--SHE'S IN THE DAIRY
HER EYES WANDERED SADLY OVER THE DULL OLD CHAMBER AND THEN LOOKED OUT VACANTLY TOWARDS THE GROWING DAWN
HETTY'S TRIAL MUST COME ON AT THE LENT ASSIZES AND THEY WERE TO BE HELD AT STONITON THE NEXT WEEK
IS THERE NOT PLEADING IN HEAVEN
HETTY MADE HASTE TO RUN AWAY UPSTAIRS NOT EASILY FINDING AN ANSWER TO HER AUNT'S QUESTION AND MRS POYSER WENT OUT TO SEE AFTER MARTY AND TOMMY AND BRING THEM IN TO SUPPER
HE SAID IN A HIGH SHARP TONE WELL SIR WHAT THEN WHY THEN INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE TH UPRIGHT HONOURABLE MAN WE'VE ALL BELIEVED YOU TO BE YOU'VE BEEN ACTING THE PART OF A SELFISH LIGHT-MINDED SCOUNDREL
THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT IMPULSE MIGHT SEIZE HIM TO-MORROW IN THIS CONFOUNDED PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO OCCUPY HIM IMPERIOUSLY THROUGH THE LIVELONG DAY
WHY THE CHASE IS LIKE A FAIR A'READY SAID MRS POYSER AS SHE GOT DOWN FROM THE CART AND SAW THE GROUPS SCATTERED UNDER THE GREAT OAKS AND THE BOYS RUNNING ABOUT IN THE HOT SUNSHINE TO SURVEY THE TALL POLES SURMOUNTED BY THE FLUTTERING GARMENTS THAT WERE TO BE THE PRIZE OF THE SUCCESSFUL CLIMBERS
WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME BE POOR DINAH FELT A PANG
WE SHOULDN'T KNOW BETTER HOW THINGS OUGHT TO BE THAN HE DOES I RECKON IF WE WAS TO SPEND OUR LIVES I PUZZLING
BUT I BEGGED HIM AS A PERSONAL FAVOUR TO ME NOT TO LET ANY REASON PREVENT HIM FROM ACCEPTING THE PLACE IF HE REALLY LIKED THE EMPLOYMENT AND WOULD NOT BE GIVING UP ANYTHING THAT WAS MORE PROFITABLE TO HIM
WHAT GOOD WILL YOU DO BY KEEPING SUCH VERMIN ALIVE EATING THE VICTUAL THAT UD FEED RATIONAL BEINGS
SHE WILL MOURN HEAVILY FOR SETH HAS TOLD ME SHE'S OF AN ANXIOUS TROUBLED HEART
I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE MUST DRINK NO OTHER PERSON'S HEALTH UNTIL WE HAVE DRUNK HIS
YOU MUST PULL YOUR FACE A DEAL LONGER BEFORE YOU'LL DO FOR ONE
I RECKON
HE'S TOO ACTIVE TO REST LONG IN THAT LONELY PLACE ALL BY HIMSELF FOR THERE'S NOTHING BUT A BIT OF A INN I THAT PART WHERE HE'S GONE TO FISH
I WONDER HOW LATE IT IS HE ADDED PULLING OUT HIS WATCH
HE DREADED OF ALL THINGS TO HEAR HIS MOTHER SPEAK OF HETTY BUT IF THY FEYTHER HAD LIVED HE'D NE'ER HA WANTED ME TO GO TO MAKE ROOM FOR ANOTHER FOR HE COULD NO MORE HA DONE WI'OUT ME NOR ONE SIDE O THE SCISSARS CAN DO WI'OUT TH OTHER
MANY OF EM GOES STARK STARIN MAD WI THEIR RELIGION
THE SUN WAS HIDDEN FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SHONE OUT WARM AGAIN LIKE A RECOVERED JOY
IT DOES NOT WAIT FOR BEAUTY--IT FLOWS WITH RESISTLESS FORCE AND BRINGS BEAUTY WITH IT
AND IT DARTED INTO ME LIKE LIGHTNING--I'D LAY THE BABY THERE AND COVER IT WITH THE GRASS AND THE CHIPS
BUT ADAM COULD RECEIVE NO AMENDS
IT WOULD BE THE EASIEST FOLLY IN THE WORLD TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
ADAM COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IN THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT
FOR WE CAN HELP ONE ANOTHER IN EVERYTHING AS IS GOOD
IT WAS AN IMMENSE RELIEF TO HIM AS HE CAME NEAR THE HOME CLOSE TO SEE MR POYSER ADVANCING TOWARDS HIM FOR THIS WOULD SPARE HIM THE PAIN OF GOING TO THE HOUSE
STRUGGLES AND RESOLVES HAD TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES INTO COMPUNCTION AND ANXIETY
THERE'S SOME AS HA BEEN BROUGHT IN AS HASN'T BEEN LOOKED ON I THAT CHARACTER YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MR THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU--SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE IT'LL BE THE FIRST OFFER O THE SORT I'VE HEARED ON
I KNOW A MAN MUST HAVE THE LOVE O GOD IN HIS SOUL AND THE BIBLE'S GOD'S WORD
LET HER SEE THAT GOD ENCOMPASSES HER
NO THE IMPRESSION HAD BEEN TOO SLIGHT TO RECUR
BUT ONCE ENTERED HE WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT ALL FACES WERE AT PRESENT SOBER AND MOST OF THEM SERIOUS--IT WAS THE REGULAR AND RESPECTABLE THING FOR THOSE EXCELLENT FARM-LABOURERS TO DO AS MUCH AS FOR ELEGANT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TO SMIRK AND BOW OVER THEIR WINE-GLASSES
HE DIDN'T LIKE TO WITNESS PAIN AND HE LIKED TO HAVE GRATEFUL EYES BEAMING ON HIM AS THE GIVER OF PLEASURE
HIS PROSPECTS WOULD JUSTIFY HIS MARRYING VERY SOON AND IF DINAH CONSENTED TO HAVE SETH THEIR MOTHER WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE CONTENTED TO LIVE APART FROM ADAM
BUT SHE'S GOT THIS NOTION O BEING A LADY'S MAID WI GOING AMONG THEM SERVANTS--WE MIGHT HA KNOWN WHAT IT UD LEAD TO WHEN WE LET HER GO TO LEARN THE FINE WORK
BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER THROWN OFF HIS COAT AND CAP THAN HE BECAME AWARE THAT ARTHUR WAS STANDING PALE AND MOTIONLESS WITH HIS HANDS STILL THRUST IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS
I THOUGHT THEY SAID TH YOUNG MESTER WAR TOOK ILL LAST NIGHT SAID SOUR OLD JOHN THE GROOM AT DINNER-TIME IN THE SERVANTS HALL
THE LADS ULL BE FINE AN HUNGRY SHE SAID HALF-ALOUD AS SHE STIRRED THE PORRIDGE
HE WAS ABOUT TO START ON A LONG JOURNEY--A DIFFICULT ONE--BY SEA--AND NO SOUL WOULD KNOW WHERE HE WAS GONE
CHAPTER V THE RECTOR BEFORE TWELVE O'CLOCK THERE HAD BEEN SOME HEAVY STORMS OF RAIN AND THE WATER LAY IN DEEP GUTTERS ON THE SIDES OF THE GRAVEL WALKS IN THE GARDEN OF BROXTON PARSONAGE
AND IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU TO LET ADAM'S MOTHER AND BROTHER KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING YES SIR YES SAID BARTLE RISING AND TAKING OFF HIS SPECTACLES I'LL DO THAT I'LL DO THAT
I WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CHILDREN AND MAKE A REGULAR FAMILY THING OF IT
WE'LL GO OUT O HEARING O THAT MAN'S NAME
I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE CONTRIVING AND THINKING IT UD BE BETTER IF SHE'D HAVE SETH AS IF I WAS WISER THAN SHE IS--OR THAN GOD EITHER FOR HE MADE HER WHAT SHE IS AND THAT'S ONE O THE GREATEST BLESSINGS I'VE EVER HAD FROM HIS HANDS AND OTHERS BESIDES ME THIS SELF-REPROOF HAD RECURRED STRONGLY TO ADAM'S MIND WHEN HE GATHERED FROM DINAH'S FACE THAT HE HAD WOUNDED HER BY REFERRING TO HIS WISH THAT SHE HAD ACCEPTED SETH AND SO HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO PUT INTO THE STRONGEST WORDS HIS CONFIDENCE IN HER DECISION AS RIGHT--HIS RESIGNATION EVEN TO HER GOING AWAY FROM THEM AND CEASING TO MAKE PART OF THEIR LIFE OTHERWISE THAN BY LIVING IN THEIR THOUGHTS IF THAT SEPARATION WERE CHOSEN BY HERSELF
WE VANISH HENCE LIKE DREAMS SEEMED TO HAVE A CLOSER APPLICATION THAN USUAL IN THE DEATH OF POOR THIAS
THERE'S TH WAGGIN COMING WI TH OLD FOLKS IN'T
I TOLD BARTLE MASSEY ON IT AN HE LAUGHED TOO YES IT'S A SMALL JOKE SETS MEN LAUGHING WHEN THEY SIT A-STARING AT ONE ANOTHER WITH A PIPE I THEIR MOUTHS SAID MRS POYSER
HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
AND YET HE FELT RELUCTANT TO GO AND LOOK AND HAVE THE CLEAR PROOF THAT IT WAS SOME ONE ELSE
SECONDLY THAT SAM PHILLIPS WHO SAWED WITH HIM HAD LEARNED TO READ WHEN HE WAS TURNED TWENTY AND WHAT COULD BE DONE BY A LITTLE FELLOW LIKE SAM PHILLIPS BILL CONSIDERED COULD BE DONE BY HIMSELF SEEING THAT HE COULD POUND SAM INTO WET CLAY IF CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRED IT
HER NECK AND ARMS WERE BARE HER HAIR HUNG DOWN IN DELICATE RINGS--AND THEY WERE JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS THEY WERE THAT NIGHT TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN THIS BED-CHAMBER GLOWING WITH VANITY AND HOPE
AND WHEN SHE SET OUT TO GO HOME IT WOULD BE HIS LAZY TIME AFTER DINNER SO HE SHOULD KEEP OUT OF HER WAY ALTOGETHER
IT'S A NAME I MR POYSER'S FAMILY
LISBETH STOOD STILL ON THE SPOT SHADING HER EYES AND LOOKING AFTER HIM TILL HE WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
SHE WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HIS PRESENCE AFTER ALL
I SUPPOSE MRS POMFRET ALWAYS EXPECTS YOU AT THIS TIME SHE EXPECTS ME AT FOUR O'CLOCK
IT WAS WORSE--IT WAS MORE CRUEL
ARTHUR BROKE THE SEAL WITH AN AGREEABLE ANTICIPATION OF SOON SEEING THE WRITER
HE SAW THAT SHE HAD THOROUGHLY ARRESTED HER HEARERS
I'LL RIDE ROUND TO ADAM MYSELF AND SEE HIM
I'M SURE I WOULDN'T BRING ANY TROUBLE OR ANNOYANCE ON HER AND THE GOOD POYSERS ON ANY ACCOUNT IF I COULD HELP IT
HOWEVER IT'S LUCKY I'VE SEEN EM
THEN TOTTY SHALL GO INTO MOTHER'S BED AND SLEEP THERE ALL NIGHT BEFORE HER MOTHER HAD DONE SPEAKING TOTTY HAD GIVEN HER ANSWER IN AN UNMISTAKABLE MANNER BY KNITTING HER BROW SETTING HER TINY TEETH AGAINST HER UNDERLIP AND LEANING FORWARD TO SLAP HETTY ON THE ARM WITH HER UTMOST FORCE
HETTY TOLD HER SHE WAS QUITE WELL THIS MORNING
NO WONDER MAN'S RELIGION HAS MUCH SORROW IN IT
THANK GOD YOU TAKE AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S FAMILY ARTHUR
BUT I'M NONE SO BAD ON'Y A BIT OF A COLD SETS ME ACHIN AN TH LADS TEASE ME SO T HA SOMEBODY WI ME T DO THE WORK--THEY MAKE ME ACHE WORSE WI TALKIN IF THEE'DST COME AND STAY WI ME THEY'D LET ME ALONE
I'LL SEND ALICK TO TELL HIM TO COME OR ELSE TO SEND UP WORD O THE WOMAN'S NAME AN THEE CANST WRITE A LETTER READY TO SEND OFF TO TREDDLES'ON AS SOON AS WE CAN MAKE OUT A DIRECTION IT'S POOR WORK WRITING LETTERS WHEN YOU WANT FOLKS TO COME TO YOU I TROUBLE SAID MRS POYSER
SHE WHO HAD NEVER GOT UP IN THE MORNING WITHOUT THE CERTAINTY OF SEEING FAMILIAR FACES PEOPLE ON WHOM SHE HAD AN ACKNOWLEDGED CLAIM
LET IT ALONE WILL YOU ADAM CALLED OUT LAYING DOWN HIS TOOLS STRIDING UP TO BEN AND SEIZING HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
WHILE SHE WAS NEAR SETH'S TALL FIGURE SHE LOOKED SHORT BUT WHEN SHE HAD MOUNTED THE CART AND WAS AWAY FROM ALL COMPARISON SHE SEEMED ABOVE THE MIDDLE HEIGHT OF WOMAN THOUGH IN REALITY SHE DID NOT EXCEED IT--AN EFFECT WHICH WAS DUE TO THE SLIMNESS OF HER FIGURE AND THE SIMPLE LINE OF HER BLACK STUFF DRESS
TOTTY MY CHICKEN GO UPSTAIRS TO COUSIN DINAH AND SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING AND GIVE HER A PRETTY KISS THIS ERRAND WAS DEVISED FOR TOTTY AS A MEANS OF CHECKING CERTAIN THREATENING SYMPTOMS ABOUT THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH
I WILL DO SO
I DON'T THINK A MAN OUGHT TO BE BLAMED SO MUCH IF HE IS BETRAYED INTO DOING THINGS IN THAT WAY IN SPITE OF HIS RESOLUTIONS AH BUT THE MOODS LIE IN HIS NATURE MY BOY JUST AS MUCH AS HIS REFLECTIONS DID AND MORE
BUT AS FOR SUCH CREATURS AS YOU METHODISSES RUN AFTER I'D AS SOON GO TO LOOK AT A LOT O BARE-RIBBED RUNTS ON A COMMON
AND THIS FREEDOM FROM CARE AS IS USUAL WITH CONSTRUCTIVE PRACTICAL MINDS LIKE HIS MADE HIM ALL THE MORE OBSERVANT OF THE OBJECTS ROUND HIM AND ALL THE MORE READY TO GATHER SUGGESTIONS FROM THEM TOWARDS HIS OWN FAVOURITE PLANS AND INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCES
HE WENT IN AGAIN WONDERING
WHAT COULD HE DO TO SECURE HIMSELF FROM ANY MORE OF THIS FOLLY
WHY SAID MARTIN LOOKING WITH SHARPER ATTENTION AT ADAM YE LOOK BAD
YOU MAY'S WELL TRY TO TURN A WAGGON IN A NARROW LANE
DINAH UNCONSCIOUSLY OPENED HER ARMS AND STRETCHED THEM OUT
SHE WAS SEWING AND WENT ON WITH HER WORK INDUSTRIOUSLY
IT WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO WAS SEATED ON A BENCH WITH TOMMY BETWEEN HIS LEGS
FEW HEROES
IT STANDS TO SENSE AS THAT CAN'T BE THE RIGHT RELIGION NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
GOOD-NIGHT MOTHER
HE COULD GO TO BED NOW AND GET SOME NEEDFUL REST BEFORE THE TIME CAME FOR THE MORNING'S HEAVY DUTY OF CARRYING HIS SICKENING NEWS TO THE HALL FARM AND TO ADAM'S HOME
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A STIR IT'S A METHODIS PREACHING SIR
I SHALL THINK OF YOU GOING ABOUT THE OLD PLACE GOOD-BYE SIR
A STRAPPIN YOUNG CARPENTER AS IS A READY-MADE METHODY LIKE SETH WOULDNA BE A BAD MATCH FOR HER
THIS MAY SEEM A STRANGE MODE OF SPEAKING ABOUT THE READING OF A PARISH CLERK--A MAN IN RUSTY SPECTACLES WITH STUBBLY HAIR A LARGE OCCIPUT AND A PROMINENT CROWN
I ASK YOU T UNDECEIVE HER BEFORE YOU GO AWAY
MR IRWINE HAD HEARD A VERSION OF IT IN EVERY PARISHIONER'S HOUSE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF THE CHASE
IT SEEMS TO ME NOW IF I WAS TO FIND FATHER AT HOME TO-NIGHT I SHOULD BEHAVE DIFFERENT
IT IS TOO PAINFUL TO THINK THAT SHE IS A WOMAN WITH A WOMAN'S DESTINY BEFORE HER--A WOMAN SPINNING IN YOUNG IGNORANCE A LIGHT WEB OF FOLLY AND VAIN HOPES WHICH MAY ONE DAY CLOSE ROUND HER AND PRESS UPON HER A RANCOROUS POISONED GARMENT CHANGING ALL AT ONCE HER FLUTTERING TRIVIAL BUTTERFLY SENSATIONS INTO A LIFE OF DEEP HUMAN ANGUISH
BUT I DON'T THINK A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLASSICS IS A PRESSING WANT TO A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
IT LITTLE BECOMES ANYBODY I THIS HOUSE TO MAKE FUN O MY SISTER'S CHILD AN HER JUST GONE AWAY FROM US AS IT WENT TO MY HEART TO PART WI HER
I'LL NEVER GI MY CONSENT TO HER GOING FOR A LADY'S MAID WHILE SHE'S GOT GOOD FRIENDS TO TAKE CARE ON HER TILL SHE'S MARRIED TO SOMEBODY BETTER NOR ONE O THEM VALETS AS IS NEITHER A COMMON MAN NOR A GENTLEMAN AN MUST LIVE ON THE FAT O THE LAND AN'S LIKE ENOUGH TO STICK HIS HANDS UNDER HIS COAT-TAILS AND EXPECT HIS WIFE TO WORK FOR HIM AYE AYE SAID MR POYSER WE MUST HAVE A BETTER HUSBAND FOR HER NOR THAT AND THERE'S BETTER AT HAND
AND WHENEVER ANYBODY SAYS A GOOD WORD FOR YOU THE PARSON'S READY TO BACK IT THAT I'LL ANSWER FOR
GOD KNOWS I'D GIVE MY LIFE IF I COULD UNDO IT THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN OPPOSITE EACH OTHER AND ADAM SAID TREMULOUSLY HOW DID SHE SEEM WHEN YOU LEFT HER SIR DON'T ASK ME ADAM ARTHUR SAID
THAT RELIEF SEEMS TO END THE MOMENT IT HAS BEGUN
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I FEEL THE SAME TOWARDS ANYBODY
I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHAT IT MEANS IF THEE'T A BIT SHORT WI ME NOW AND THEN THERE'S MOTHER OPENING THE DOOR TO LOOK OUT FOR US SAID ADAM AS THEY MOUNTED THE SLOPE
LOOKING AT THE LITTLE TRINKETS WHICH SHE HAD ONCE EYED AND FINGERED SO FONDLY AS THE EARNEST OF HER FUTURE PARADISE OF FINERY SHE LIVED BACK IN THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER WITH SUCH TENDER CARESSES SUCH STRANGELY PRETTY WORDS SUCH GLOWING LOOKS WHICH FILLED HER WITH A BEWILDERING DELICIOUS SURPRISE--THEY WERE SO MUCH SWEETER THAN SHE HAD THOUGHT ANYTHING COULD BE
SHE CLOSED HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT FEEL MORE INTENSELY THE PRESENCE OF A LOVE AND SYMPATHY DEEPER AND MORE TENDER THAN WAS BREATHED FROM THE EARTH AND SKY
YET HE BELIEVED IN DREAMS AND PROGNOSTICS AND TO HIS DYING DAY HE BATED HIS BREATH A LITTLE WHEN HE TOLD THE STORY OF THE STROKE WITH THE WILLOW WAND
BUT WHAT'S SETH GOT TO DO WITH MARRYIN AS IS ON'Y THREE-AN'-TWENTY
BUT I STICK TO MARTIN--I SHALL ALWAYS STICK TO MARTIN
DOES ANY SWEET OR SAD MEMORY MINGLE WITH THIS DREAM OF THE FUTURE--ANY LOVING THOUGHT OF HER SECOND PARENTS--OF THE CHILDREN SHE HAD HELPED TO TEND--OF ANY YOUTHFUL COMPANION ANY PET ANIMAL ANY RELIC OF HER OWN CHILDHOOD EVEN
SHE'D BUT BAD LUCK
I BEGAN TO SEE AS ALL THIS WEIGHING AND SIFTING WHAT THIS TEXT MEANS AND THAT TEXT MEANS AND WHETHER FOLKS ARE SAVED ALL BY GOD'S GRACE OR WHETHER THERE GOES AN OUNCE O THEIR OWN WILL TO'T WAS NO PART O REAL RELIGION AT ALL
THEY HAD EXPECTED HETTY TO STAY AWAY A WEEK OR TEN DAYS AT LEAST PERHAPS A LITTLE LONGER IF DINAH CAME BACK WITH HER BECAUSE THERE MIGHT THEN BE SOMETHING TO DETAIN THEM AT SNOWFIELD
I DON'T KNOW THAT I AM MORE LIABLE TO IRRESOLUTION THAN OTHER PEOPLE
FOR THOUGH MY GRANDFATHER TALKED OF A CARTE BLANCHE HE COULDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND TO TRUST ME WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT NEVER MIND YOU'LL GIVE MORE PLEASURE IN THIS QUIET WAY SAID MR IRWINE
IT ISN'T NOTIONS SETS PEOPLE DOING THE RIGHT THING--IT'S FEELINGS
EVEN THE VERDICT TO DISTANT EYES HAD NOT APPEARED TO MOVE HER BUT THOSE WHO WERE NEAR SAW HER TREMBLING
IT HAD BEEN RATHER A MELANCHOLY DAY TO SETH
COME YOU'LL GO ON WITH US ADAM MR POYSER SAID WHEN THEY REACHED THE TURNING
SHE WAS FEARFUL LEST THE STRENGTH OF HER FEELING TOWARDS HIM SHOULD HINDER HER FROM WAITING AND LISTENING FAITHFULLY FOR THE ULTIMATE GUIDING VOICE FROM WITHIN
MR IRWINE HAD NOT MENTIONED ARTHUR'S NAME TO BURGE AND YET THE STORY OF HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS HETTY WITH ALL THE DARK SHADOWS CAST UPON IT BY ITS TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES WAS PRESENTLY AS WELL KNOWN AS THAT HIS GRANDFATHER WAS DEAD AND THAT HE WAS COME INTO THE ESTATE
BUT THERE'S ONE ABOVE ULL TAKE CARE O THE INNICENT CHILD ELSE IT'S BUT LITTLE TRUTH THEY TELL US AT CHURCH
IS IT DEATH ADAM
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO RESERVED TO HER
IN THE LARGE WICKER-BOTTOMED ARM-CHAIR IN THE LEFT-HAND CHIMNEY-NOOK SAT OLD MARTIN POYSER A HALE BUT SHRUNKEN AND BLEACHED IMAGE OF HIS PORTLY BLACK-HAIRED SON--HIS HEAD HANGING FORWARD A LITTLE AND HIS ELBOWS PUSHED BACKWARDS SO AS TO ALLOW THE WHOLE OF HIS FOREARM TO REST ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR
SOME OF THE METHODISTS WERE RESTING ON THESE WITH THEIR EYES CLOSED AS IF WRAPT IN PRAYER OR MEDITATION
I CAN'T SAY GOOD-BYE WHILE THERE'S ANY HOPE
BUT HE HAD THE BEST ANTIDOTE AGAINST IMAGINATIVE DREAD IN THE NECESSITY FOR GETTING ON WITH THE COFFIN AND FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES HIS HAMMER WAS RINGING SO UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT OTHER SOUNDS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT WELL BE OVERPOWERED
I'M NOT SURE THAT MEN ARE THE FONDEST OF THOSE WHO TRY TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
NOR WAS EVERY LABOURER SO HONEST AS OUR FRIEND ALICK
ADAM VERY MUCH STARTLED WENT AT ONCE TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT
THE OLD WOMAN LISTENED AND FORGOT TO BE FRETFUL UNCONSCIOUSLY SUBJECT TO THE SOOTHING INFLUENCE OF DINAH'S FACE AND VOICE
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO BREAKFAST WITH ME THESE FIVE YEARS IT WAS A TEMPTING MORNING FOR A RIDE BEFORE BREAKFAST SAID ARTHUR
AND TO CLOSE THE VISTA THERE WAS A CRIMSON ALTAR-CLOTH EMBROIDERED WITH GOLDEN RAYS BY MISS LYDIA'S OWN HAND
NOT MATTER SAID ADAM GRAVELY
YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS
HE KNEW BY HEART EVERY ARABESQUE FLOURISH IN THE FRAMED SPECIMEN OF BARTLE MASSEY'S HANDWRITING WHICH HUNG OVER THE SCHOOLMASTER'S HEAD BY WAY OF KEEPING A LOFTY IDEAL BEFORE THE MINDS OF HIS PUPILS
HETTY SORREL IS IN PRISON AND WILL BE TRIED ON FRIDAY FOR THE CRIME OF CHILD-MURDER
THAT UD BE POOR THANKS TO YOU TO SAY THAT YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL THESE YEARS AND YET HAVEN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO FIND OUT A GREAT DEAL O THE TRUTH ABOUT ME
BROTHER HE SAID FAINTLY--HE NEVER CALLED ADAM BROTHER EXCEPT IN SOLEMN MOMENTS--"I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'LL DO ANYTHING AS YOU CAN'T ASK GOD'S BLESSING ON NAY LAD SAID ADAM DON'T BE AFRAID
A SCENT OF PINE-WOOD FROM A TENTLIKE PILE OF PLANKS OUTSIDE THE OPEN DOOR MINGLED ITSELF WITH THE SCENT OF THE ELDER-BUSHES WHICH WERE SPREADING THEIR SUMMER SNOW CLOSE TO THE OPEN WINDOW OPPOSITE
WOULD HE COME
SHE'S NEVER TOO ILL TO CARE ABOUT THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF HUMAN SPEECH IS MERE PURPOSELESS IMPULSE OR HABIT YOU WILL NOT WONDER WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THIS IDENTICAL OBJECTION HAD BEEN MADE AND HAD RECEIVED THE SAME KIND OF ANSWER MANY HUNDRED TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE FIFTEEN YEARS THAT MR IRWINE'S SISTER ANNE HAD BEEN AN INVALID
I'LL PUT ONE O DINAH'S CAPS ON WHEN WE GO IN AND YOU'LL SEE IF I LOOK BETTER IN IT
HOW TO RECONCILE HIS DIGNITY WITH THE SATISFACTION OF HIS CURIOSITY BY WALKING TOWARDS THE GREEN WAS THE PROBLEM THAT MR CASSON HAD BEEN REVOLVING IN HIS MIND FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES
IT WAS NOT A VERY LONG CHAIN ONLY ALLOWING THE LOCKET TO HANG A LITTLE WAY BELOW THE EDGE OF HER FROCK
BUT LIKE ALL SOUNDS THAT FALL ON OUR EARS IN A STATE OF ABSTRACTION IT HAD NO DISTINCT CHARACTER BUT WAS SIMPLY LOUD AND STARTLING SO THAT SHE FELT UNCERTAIN WHETHER SHE HAD INTERPRETED IT RIGHTLY
INDEED OUR PLEASANT MEETING TO-DAY IS A PROOF THAT WHEN WHAT IS GOOD COMES OF AGE AND IS LIKELY TO LIVE THERE IS REASON FOR REJOICING AND THE RELATION BETWEEN US AS CLERGYMAN AND PARISHIONERS CAME OF AGE TWO YEARS AGO FOR IT IS THREE-AND-TWENTY YEARS SINCE I FIRST CAME AMONG YOU AND I SEE SOME TALL FINE-LOOKING YOUNG MEN HERE AS WELL AS SOME BLOOMING YOUNG WOMEN THAT WERE FAR FROM LOOKING AS PLEASANTLY AT ME WHEN I CHRISTENED THEM AS I AM HAPPY TO SEE THEM LOOKING NOW
AN HAVEN'T YOU GOT METHODISTS ENOW AT TREDDLES'ON TO GO AND LOOK AT IF CHURCH-FOLKS'S FACES ARE TOO HANDSOME TO PLEASE YOU
AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE VALUE I SET ON THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU DINAH
I HANNA COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES
BUT HOW'S YE T KNOW THAT
DID HE NOT DESERVE WHAT WAS SAID OF HIM ON THE WHOLE
HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD DEBATED WITH HIMSELF THERE BEFORE DINNER AND IT HAD ALL COME TO NOTHING--WORSE THAN NOTHING
IF I WERE CLOSELY QUESTIONED I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO CONFESS THAT HE FELT NO SERIOUS ALARMS ABOUT THE SOULS OF HIS PARISHIONERS AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A MERE LOSS OF TIME TO TALK IN A DOCTRINAL AND AWAKENING MANNER TO OLD FEYTHER TAFT OR EVEN TO CHAD CRANAGE THE BLACKSMITH
SITTING BY THAT SICK WOMAN I DARESAY AS SHE'D SET HER HEART ON GOING TO ALL OF A SUDDEN AH IT WAS A PITY SHE SHOULD TAKE SUCH MEGRIMS INTO HER HEAD WHEN SHE MIGHT HA STAYED WI US ALL SUMMER AND EATEN TWICE AS MUCH AS SHE WANTED AND IT UD NIVER HA BEEN MISSED
AND YOU CAN HELP THE SICK JUST AS MUCH AND YOU'LL HAVE MORE MEANS O MAKING EM A BIT COMFORTABLE
SO WHEN THE WORKMEN WERE GONE HE SAT DOWN TOOK OUT HIS POCKET-BOOK AND BUSIED HIMSELF WITH SKETCHING A PLAN AND MAKING A SPECIFICATION OF THE EXPENSES THAT HE MIGHT SHOW IT TO BURGE THE NEXT MORNING AND SET HIM ON PERSUADING THE SQUIRE TO CONSENT
AND I THINK HIS BLUE LINEN HANDKERCHIEF WAS VERY WET WITH TEARS LONG BEFORE HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO SET HIS FACE STEADILY HOMEWARDS
ADAM'S HEART WAS TOO FULL TO SPEAK AND HE THOUGHT HETTY KNEW ALL THAT WAS IN IT
IT'S A DESPERATELY VEXATIOUS THING THAT AFTER ALL ONE'S REFLECTIONS AND QUIET DETERMINATIONS WE SHOULD BE RULED BY MOODS THAT ONE CAN'T CALCULATE ON BEFOREHAND
THERE WAS SOME SECURITY IN THIS CONSTANT OCCUPATION AGAINST AN UNCONTROLLABLE IMPULSE SEIZING HIM TO RUSH TO HETTY AND THRUST INTO HER HAND SOME MAD PROPOSITION THAT WOULD UNDO EVERYTHING
HOWEVER IT WAS NO ONE FROM THE POYSER FAMILY WENT TO CHURCH THAT AFTERNOON EXCEPT HETTY AND THE BOYS
WHAT DO YOU THINK DINAH'S BEEN A-TELLING ME SINCE DINNER-TIME MRS POYSER CONTINUED LOOKING AT HER HUSBAND
OR AS HE PUSHES ONE OF THE YOUNGER WORKMEN ASIDE AND TAKES HIS PLACE IN UPHEAVING A WEIGHT OF TIMBER SAYING LET ALONE LAD
IT'S NOTHING OF A PLAGUE TO WHAT THE WENCHES ARE NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTERRUPTION IN THEIR WALK THE EXCELLENT HABIT WHICH MRS POYSER'S CLOCK HAD OF TAKING TIME BY THE FORELOCK HAD SECURED THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE VILLAGE WHILE IT WAS STILL A QUARTER TO TWO THOUGH ALMOST EVERY ONE WHO MEANT TO GO TO CHURCH WAS ALREADY WITHIN THE CHURCHYARD GATES
LET ME KEEP THEE COMPANY IN TROUBLE WHILE I CAN IT WAS A LONG AND DREARY NIGHT IN THAT SMALL CHAMBER
NOW AND THEN THERE WAS A NEW ARRIVAL
IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
OTHERS HELD A MIDWAY POSITION SOMETIMES WATCHING THE GROUP AT THE GRAVE SOMETIMES LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION OF THE FARMERS WHO STOOD IN A KNOT NEAR THE CHURCH DOOR AND WERE NOW JOINED BY MARTIN POYSER WHILE HIS FAMILY PASSED INTO THE CHURCH
SETH WITH LARGE RUGGED FEATURES THE CLOSE COPY OF HIS BROTHER'S BUT WITH THIN WAVY BROWN HAIR AND BLUE DREAMY EYES AS OFTEN AS NOT LOOKING VAGUELY OUT OF THE WINDOW INSTEAD OF AT HIS BOOK ALTHOUGH IT WAS A NEWLY BOUGHT BOOK--WESLEY'S ABRIDGMENT OF MADAME GUYON'S LIFE WHICH WAS FULL OF WONDER AND INTEREST FOR HIM
PERHAPS A SLOUCHING LABOURER WHO HAVING EATEN HIS SUPPER CAME OUT TO LOOK AT THE UNUSUAL SCENE WITH A SLOW BOVINE GAZE WILLING TO HEAR WHAT ANY ONE HAD TO SAY IN EXPLANATION OF IT BUT BY NO MEANS EXCITED ENOUGH TO ASK A QUESTION
BUT TH HUNGRY FOULKS HAD BETTER LEAVE TH HUNGRY COUNTRY
I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS--NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
THOSE SLIGHT WORDS AND LOOKS AND TOUCHES ARE PART OF THE SOUL'S LANGUAGE
BUT WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE INTRICACIES OF HER SYNTAX JUST YET AND IN A HASTY READING WE MAY HAPPEN TO EXTRACT THE VERY OPPOSITE OF HER REAL MEANING
HE TURNED TOWARDS MRS POYSER TO SEE IF SHE TOO HAD BEEN OBSERVANT OF TOM AND THE EYES OF HUSBAND AND WIFE MET IN A GLANCE OF GOOD-NATURED AMUSEMENT
THE DESIRE TO SEE HETTY HAD RUSHED BACK LIKE AN ILL-STEMMED CURRENT
POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC TAYLOR'S HOLY LIVING AND DYING THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH BUNYAN'S LIFE AND HOLY WAR A GREAT DEAL OF BAILEY'S DICTIONARY VALENTINE AND ORSON AND PART OF A HISTORY OF BABYLON WHICH BARTLE MASSEY HAD LENT HIM
YOU KNOW I'M GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY SO I SHAN'T MAKE ANY MORE MISTAKES OF THE KIND
FOR I'M PRETTY SURE THE FATHER WAS THAT HULKING BULL-TERRIER OF WILL BAKER'S--WASN'T HE NOW EH YOU SLY HUSSY HERE VIXEN TUCKED HER TAIL BETWEEN HER LEGS AND RAN FORWARD INTO THE HOUSE
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU MUST BE A METHODIST TO KNOW WHAT A METHODIST ULL DO
I'M VERY TIRED WHAT AILS HIM DOST KNOW LISBETH SAID TO SETH WHEN ADAM WAS GONE UPSTAIRS
I THOUGHT YOU'D HA PERSUADED HER BETTER
BUT YOU TOLD ME THE TRUTH WHEN YOU SAID TO ME ONCE THERE'S A SORT OF WRONG THAT CAN NEVER BE MADE UP FOR WHY THERE'S MR AND MRS POYSER COMING IN AT THE YARD GATE SAID SETH
BUT SCHOLARSHIP DOESN'T RUN IN YOUR FAMILY BLOOD NO INDEED
MR IRWINE AFTER SEATING HIS SISTER ANNE HAD GONE TO THE ABBEY GALLERY AS HE HAD AGREED WITH ARTHUR BEFOREHAND TO SEE HOW THE MERRIMENT OF THE COTTAGERS WAS PROSPERING
SHE COULD NOT CARE ABOUT THEM
SHE FELT THAT HER AUNT WAS CURTSYING
JOSHUA RANN GAVE A LONG COUGH AS IF HE WERE CLEARING HIS THROAT IN ORDER TO COME TO A NEW UNDERSTANDING WITH HIMSELF
BUT OF LATE YEARS HE HAD NEVER COME HOME AT DARK HOURS FROM TREDDLESTON AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HE WAS THEN SLEEPING OFF HIS DRUNKENNESS AT THE WAGGON OVERTHROWN BESIDES TO ADAM THE CONCEPTION OF THE FUTURE WAS SO INSEPARABLE FROM THE PAINFUL IMAGE OF HIS FATHER THAT THE FEAR OF ANY FATAL ACCIDENT TO HIM WAS EXCLUDED BY THE DEEPLY INFIXED FEAR OF HIS CONTINUAL DEGRADATION
WHEN THE SAD EYES MET--WHEN HETTY AND ADAM LOOKED AT EACH OTHER--SHE FELT THE CHANGE IN HIM TOO AND IT SEEMED TO STRIKE HER WITH FRESH FEAR
AND ONE MEETS SOME FINE STRAPPING FELLOWS ABOUT TOO
I'M THINKING WE SHALL HAVE MORE RAIN
AND AS LONG AS ADAM THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY HOPE OF HER HAVING HIM HE WOULD DO JUST WHAT SHE LIKED SHE KNEW
YOU TALK O THEM GELLS NANCY AND MOLLY BEING CLEVER I THEIR WORK SHE BEGAN AGAIN
THE DESCRIPTION OF HER PERSON CORRESPONDS ONLY THAT SHE IS SAID TO LOOK VERY PALE AND ILL
SHE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING BEYOND THE SIMPLE NOTIONS AND HABITS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO HAVE ANY MORE DEFINITE IDEA OF HER PROBABLE FUTURE THAN THAT ARTHUR WOULD TAKE CARE OF HER SOMEHOW AND SHELTER HER FROM ANGER AND SCORN
THAT'S A THING NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE HE OBSERVED TO GO OUT O THE DOOR WITH MY SPECTACLES ON
I'D JUST BEEN T HEV A PINT--IT WAS HALF AFTER TEN I THE FORE-NOON WHEN I HEV MY PINT AS REG'LAR AS THE CLOCK--AND I SAYS TO KNOWLES AS DRUV UP WITH HIS WAGGON YOU'LL GET A BIT O BARLEY TO-DAY KNOWLES I SAYS IF YOU LOOK ABOUT YOU
IT CAN BE MERGED ANY MINUTE INTO A TROT OR A CANTER AND ONE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED FROM SOCRATES HIMSELF IN THE SADDLE
THE DRUGGIST AT TREDDLESTON HAD GIVEN HIM A NOTION THAT HE MIGHT SAVE HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL OF LABOUR AND EXPENSE IF HE COULD LEARN TO READ AND SO HE HAD BEGUN TO GIVE HIS SPARE HOURS TO THE NIGHT-SCHOOL RESOLVING THAT HIS LITTLE CHAP SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN COMING TO MR MASSEY'S DAY-SCHOOL AS SOON AS HE WAS OLD ENOUGH
THERE'S THE BIG CLOCK STRIKIN EIGHT SAID MR POYSER
I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES
THE BLAME LAY WITH THAT MAN WHO HAD SELFISHLY PLAYED WITH HER HEART--HAD PERHAPS EVEN DELIBERATELY LURED HER AWAY
BUT HE WAS IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE DUSTY CONDITION OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD A LONG HURRIED JOURNEY AND HE MUST REALLY REFRESH HIMSELF BY ATTENDING TO HIS TOILETTE A LITTLE BEFORE HE READ HIS LETTERS
AND HERE'S THIS BLESSED CHILD WI THE FEVER FOR WHAT I KNOW AND AS WAKEFUL AS IF IT WAS DINNER-TIME AND NOBODY TO HELP ME TO GIVE HER THE PHYSIC BUT YOUR UNCLE AND FINE WORK THERE'S BEEN AND HALF OF IT SPILT ON HER NIGHT-GOWN--IT'S WELL IF SHE'S SWALLOWED MORE NOR ULL MAKE HER WORSE I'STEAD O BETTER
AND THAT MOREOVER TO LOOK AT EAR-RINGS WHICH SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY WEAR OUT OF HER BEDROOM COULD HARDLY BE A SATISFACTION THE ESSENCE OF VANITY BEING A REFERENCE TO THE IMPRESSIONS PRODUCED ON OTHERS
SHE CRAVED FOOD AND REST--SHE HASTENED TOWARDS THEM AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE WAS PICTURING TO HERSELF THE BANK FROM WHICH SHE WOULD LEAP TOWARDS DEATH
WELL I THINK I'VE GOT SOME THINGS IN MINE THAT WILL MAKE A PRETTY JINGLE IN IT
IT MAY STAND ME IN GOOD STEAD SOME DAY THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE ANY PRESENT USE FOR IT
THE PLEASURE HE FELT WAS IN HIS FACE AS HE SAID MY GRANDFATHER AND I HOPE ALL OUR FRIENDS HERE HAVE ENJOYED THEIR DINNER AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD
IT'S YOU MUST ANSWER EM FOR I'M DUMB
WELL THEN IF YOU FEEL IT ADAM REJOINED EAGERLY
WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
BUT EVEN TO HER HETTY SHRANK FROM BESEECHING AND CONFESSION
BUT WHAT DID YE DO WHEN YOUR AUNT DIED AN WHY DIDNA YE COME TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY BEIN AS MRS POYSER'S YOUR AUNT TOO DINAH SEEING THAT LISBETH'S ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED TOLD HER THE STORY OF HER EARLY LIFE--HOW SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP TO WORK HARD AND WHAT SORT OF PLACE SNOWFIELD WAS AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD A HARD LIFE THERE--ALL THE DETAILS THAT SHE THOUGHT LIKELY TO INTEREST LISBETH
ADAM YOU PERCEIVE WAS BY NO MEANS A MARVELLOUS MAN NOR PROPERLY SPEAKING A GENIUS YET I WILL NOT PRETEND THAT HIS WAS AN ORDINARY CHARACTER AMONG WORKMEN
BUT GRADUALLY THE INFLUENCE OF THE GENERAL GRAVITY TOLD UPON HER AND SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF WHAT DINAH WAS SAYING
AS SOON AS SHE WAS GONE HE SAID I DON'T WONDER AT THEE FOR LOVING HER SETH
THEE'T LIKE POOR MOTHER USED TO BE
HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE TOWARDS ONE WHO ALWAYS PUT IN A KIND WORD FOR HER WHEN HER AUNT WAS FINDING FAULT AND WHO WAS ALWAYS READY TO TAKE TOTTY OFF HER HANDS--LITTLE TIRESOME TOTTY THAT WAS MADE SUCH A PET OF BY EVERY ONE AND THAT HETTY COULD SEE NO INTEREST IN AT ALL
MAKE THEM GLAD ACCORDING TO THE DAYS WHEREIN THOU HAST AFFLICTED THEM AND THE YEARS WHEREIN THEY HAVE SEEN EVIL
AND I KNOW BEGGING HIS HONOUR'S PARDON THAT YOU COULDN'T GET SUCH A SCREEN AT ROSSETER UNDER TWO GUINEAS
BUT THERE WERE NO MORE CURTSIES--NO HE WAS NOT COME
IT'S GOD A'MIGHTY'S WAY O QUIETENING EM I RECKON AFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP OLD MARTIN OPENED THE GATE AS HE SAW THE FAMILY PROCESSION APPROACHING AND HELD IT WIDE OPEN LEANING ON HIS STICK--PLEASED TO DO THIS BIT OF WORK
BUT MR POYSER TO WHOM AN EXTRA GLASS HAD RESTORED HIS YOUTHFUL CONFIDENCE IN HIS GOOD LOOKS AND GOOD DANCING WALKED ALONG WITH THEM QUITE PROUDLY SECRETLY FLATTERING HIMSELF THAT MISS LYDIA HAD NEVER HAD A PARTNER IN HER LIFE WHO COULD LIFT HER OFF THE GROUND AS HE WOULD
LOOK AT THE CANALS AN TH AQUEDUC'S AN TH COAL-PIT ENGINES AND ARKWRIGHT'S MILLS THERE AT CROMFORD
YOU'LL MAYHAP BE MAKING SUCH A SLIP YOURSELF SOME DAY
PRESENTLY ADAM'S THOUGHTS RECURRED TO WHAT MR CRAIG HAD SAID ABOUT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE AND PICTURED HIS GOING AWAY AND THE CHANGES THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE BEFORE HE CAME BACK
WHEN YOUR BROTH'S READY-MADE FOR YOU YOU MUN SWALLOW THE THICKENIN OR ELSE LET THE BROTH ALONE THEN IF HETTY ULL DANCE WITH ME SAID ADAM YIELDING EITHER TO MRS POYSER'S ARGUMENT OR TO SOMETHING ELSE I'LL DANCE WHICHEVER DANCE SHE'S FREE I'VE GOT NO PARTNER FOR THE FOURTH DANCE SAID HETTY
YOU KNOW I WON'T STRIKE YOU WHILE YOU STAND SO GO AWAY ADAM SAID ARTHUR I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU NO SAID ADAM BITTERLY
THIS POSSIBILITY HEIGHTENED THE ANXIETY WITH WHICH HE LOOKED FORWARD TO ARTHUR'S ARRIVAL
WE SEE EYES--AH SO LIKE OUR MOTHER'S!--AVERTED FROM US IN COLD ALIENATION
CHAPTER XXXVIII THE QUEST THE FIRST TEN DAYS AFTER HETTY'S DEPARTURE PASSED AS QUIETLY AS ANY OTHER DAYS WITH THE FAMILY AT THE HALL FARM AND WITH ADAM AT HIS DAILY WORK
THAT MERRY STAMPING THAT GRACIOUS NODDING OF THE HEAD THAT WAVING BESTOWAL OF THE HAND--WHERE CAN WE SEE THEM NOW
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO THE WOOD AND WOULD PERHAPS FIND THE BABY
I REMEMBER HIS FACE WELL
IT WAS VEXATIOUS
A VERY FOOLISH THOUGHT--IT COULD NOT BE HETTY
THEE WOULDSTNA HA EM CARRY ME TO TH CHURCHYARD AN THEE NOT TO FOLLOW ME
HE HAD ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO TO MAKE UP HIS MIND IN AND HE MUST GET CLEAR AND CALM
AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE GATE HAD CLOSED BEHIND THE CAPTAIN THAT SHE TURNED INTO THE KITCHEN AGAIN WHERE DINAH STOOD WITH HER BONNET IN HER HAND WAITING TO SPEAK TO HER AUNT BEFORE SHE SET OUT FOR LISBETH BEDE'S COTTAGE
FOR HER HAT WAS TRIMMED WITH PINK AND HER FROCK HAD PINK SPOTS SPRINKLED ON A WHITE GROUND
FOR I COULD BRING THEM AS UD SWEAR AS HE CALLED YOU A DUMB DOG AN A IDLE SHEPHERD YOU'LL FORGI'E ME FOR SAYIN SUCH THINGS OVER AGAIN BETTER NOT BETTER NOT JOSHUA
AND WHAT DOES YOUR PARSON SAY I WONDER TO A YOUNG WOMAN PREACHING JUST UNDER HIS NOSE PARSON IRWINE SIR DOESN'T LIVE HERE
IT'S GOD'S WILL AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US
HE WAS A CONTEMPLATIVE RATHER STOUT GENTLEMAN OF EXCELLENT DIGESTION
YOU'RE LIKE THE REST O THE WOMEN--ALWAYS PUTTING IN YOUR WORD BEFORE YOU KNOW WHY VIXEN RETURNED TO HER HAMPER AGAIN IN HUMILIATION AND HER MASTER CONTINUED HIS SUPPER IN A SILENCE WHICH ADAM DID NOT CHOOSE TO INTERRUPT
THE VAGUE ANXIETY ABOUT HIS FATHER WAS CHANGED INTO A GREAT DREAD
THE SCENE WAS THE GROVE BY DONNITHORNE CHASE
WITH YOUR NEIGHBOUR MRS GREEN WHO WAS REALLY KIND TO YOU IN YOUR LAST ILLNESS BUT HAS SAID SEVERAL ILL-NATURED THINGS ABOUT YOU SINCE YOUR CONVALESCENCE
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME IN A LITTLE SOONER ARTHUR TO HEAR JOSHUA'S DENUNCIATION OF HIS NEIGHBOUR WILL MASKERY
NAY NAY I WONNA HA THEE DO THAT--THE YOUNG SQUIRE ULL BE ANGERED
THE PASTURES ARE OFTEN A LITTLE TANNED YET THE CORN HAS NOT GOT ITS LAST SPLENDOUR OF RED AND GOLD
SO SHE LOCKED UP HER DRAWER AND WENT AWAY TO HER EARLY WORK
FOLKS MUN ALLAYS CHOOSE BY CONTRAIRIES AS IF THEY MUST BE SORTED LIKE THE PORK--A BIT O GOOD MEAT WI A BIT O OFFAL TO THE FEMININE MIND IN SOME OF ITS MOODS ALL THINGS THAT MIGHT BE RECEIVE A TEMPORARY CHARM FROM COMPARISON WITH WHAT IS
THAT'S THE BEST SARMUNT I'VE HEARED THIS LONG WHILE
HOWEVER IT WAS A NICE BIT O WORK AND I LIKED DOING IT FOR HER
YET I ASSURE YOU THESE GREY PEWS WITH THE BUFF-WASHED WALLS GAVE A VERY PLEASING TONE TO THIS SHABBY INTERIOR AND AGREED EXTREMELY WELL WITH THE RUDDY FACES AND BRIGHT WAISTCOATS
YOU SEE IT'S THE SAME WITH BOTH ME AND THE POYSERS
THE LAD DOES NO HARM AS I KNOW OF
AH IF HE COULD BUT COMFORT HER AND SOOTHE HER AND SAVE HER FROM THIS PAIN
AND I'M NOT SURE BUT WHAT HE TRIES TO O'ERCOME IT
I THOUGHT YE WAR DEAD AGAIN TH WOMEN PREACHIN A WHILE AGOO NAY I'M NOT TURNIN NOWAY
SHE'D TAKEN HER CLOAK AND BONNET BUT SHE'D LEFT THE BASKET AND THE THINGS IN IT....I WAS DREADFUL FRIGHTENED AND ANGRY WITH HER FOR GOING
THINK O THAT NOW SAID MR POYSER IMPRESSED AT ONCE WITH THE POLITICAL BEARINGS OF THE FACT AND WITH ITS STRIKING INTEREST AS AN ANECDOTE IN NATURAL HISTORY
I CAN'T THINK WHAT THE FELLOW MEANS BY SENDING SUCH THINGS TO ME
AND THAT IS A BLIND SELF-SEEKING WHICH WANTS TO BE FREED FROM THE SORROW WHEREWITH THE WHOLE CREATION GROANETH AND TRAVAILETH
THEY REALLY WERE VERY NICE INDEED AND SHE HAD GIVEN ALMOST ALL HER SPARE MONEY FOR THEM
AND I SAY NOW WHAT I SAID THREE WEEKS AGO THE SOONER WE GET RID OF HER THE BETTER FOR THERE'S THAT LITTLE YALLOW COW AS DOESN'T GIVE HALF THE MILK AND YET I'VE TWICE AS MUCH BUTTER FROM HER WHY THEE'T NOT LIKE THE WOMEN IN GENERAL SAID MR POYSER
AND WHEN I THOUGHT THE FOLKS AT THE FARM WERE TOO HARD WITH HER I SAID I'D NEVER BE HARD TO ANYBODY MYSELF AGAIN
ARTHUR FELT THAT HE SHOULD BE MORE OF A MAN ON HORSEBACK
TO CROWN ALL THERE WAS TO BE A DONKEY-RACE--THAT SUBLIMEST OF ALL RACES CONDUCTED ON THE GRAND SOCIALISTIC IDEA OF EVERYBODY ENCOURAGING EVERYBODY ELSE'S DONKEY AND THE SORRIEST DONKEY WINNING
A PRETTY BUILDING I'M MAKING WITHOUT EITHER BRICKS OR TIMBER
THEN HE WILL TURN AWAY FROM YOU AND SAY DEPART FROM ME INTO EVER-LASTING FIRE POOR BESSY'S WIDE-OPEN BLACK EYES BEGAN TO FILL WITH TEARS HER GREAT RED CHEEKS AND LIPS BECAME QUITE PALE AND HER FACE WAS DISTORTED LIKE A LITTLE CHILD'S BEFORE A BURST OF CRYING
HER PALE FACE BECAME PALER
FOR HE WAS A LITTLE TOO SHY TO JOIN THE POYSER PARTY ON THIS PUBLIC OCCASION
BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME--OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS--AND ADAM THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST
SHE'S NO BETTER THAN A PEACOCK AS UD STRUT ABOUT ON THE WALL AND SPREAD ITS TAIL WHEN THE SUN SHONE IF ALL THE FOLKS I THE PARISH WAS DYING
SHE TALKS SOMETHING LIKE THAT OSTLER WE HAD THAT COME FROM THE NORTH
BUT BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE LETTER CONSIDER HETTY AND DON'T LET IT TAKE TOO MUCH HOLD ON YOU
OH IT WAS SO DREADFUL DINAH...I WAS SO MISERABLE...I WISHED I'D NEVER BEEN BORN INTO THIS WORLD
LEAVE THAT TO FOOLS THAT NEVER GOT BEYOND A SUM IN SIMPLE ADDITION
IS MR POYSER COMING HE IS COME
BUT I WAS AWAY AT LEEDS AND DIDN'T KNOW OF THIS GREAT TROUBLE IN TIME TO GET HERE BEFORE TO-DAY
BUT AS FOR FARMING SIR I CANNA THINK AS YOU'D LIKE IT
THERE MUST BE NO REPORT SPREAD THAT I HAVE TAKEN NOTICE OF THE QUARREL ELSE I SHALL LOSE THE LITTLE GOOD INFLUENCE I HAVE OVER THE OLD MAN WELL I LIKE THAT WOMAN EVEN BETTER THAN HER CREAM-CHEESES SAID MRS IRWINE
AND AS FOR THE YOUNG LASSES I'D AS SOON LOOK AT WATER-GRUBS
YOU FORGET SHE'S GOT NO HUSBAND TO PREACH TO
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY IT
THE WAGGON-LOADS OF HAY NO LONGER CREEP ALONG THE LANES SCATTERING THEIR SWEET-SMELLING FRAGMENTS ON THE BLACKBERRY BRANCHES
BUT IF I'M PAID I CAN'T TAKE A SMALLER PRICE THAN I ASKED BECAUSE THAT UD BE LIKE SAYING I'D ASKED MORE THAN WAS JUST
HE COULDN'T BEAR TO BLAME HER
THE INWARD ACTION WAS TOO INTENSE FOR ADAM TO TAKE IN OUTWARD OBJECTS UNTIL SOME STRONG SENSATION ROUSED HIM
SHE WALKED TOWARDS IT HEAVILY OVER THE TUFTED GRASS WITH PALE LIPS AND A SENSE OF TREMBLING
HE HAD LONG AGO EXHAUSTED THE RESOURCES OF HIS IMAGINATION IN TRYING TO THINK HOW THE BUNCH OF LEATHERY SEAWEED HAD LOOKED AND GROWN IN ITS NATIVE ELEMENT
THEY'D NEVER COME T ANYTHING BUT THEY MADE HIM HAPPY AND IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO ADAM HAD BEEN GETTING MORE AND MORE INDULGENT TO SETH
IS NOT THE MAN OF SORROWS THERE IN THAT CRUCIFIED BODY WHEREWITH HE ASCENDED
BUT THERE'S REASON I WHAT I SAY ELSE I SHOULDNA SAY IT
IT GOES TO ONE'S EART TO LOOK AT HER IT UD HAVE BEEN A GOOD DEAL BETTER FOR HER IF SHE'D BEEN UGLIER AND HAD MORE CONDUCT SAID THE LANDLADY WHO ON ANY CHARITABLE CONSTRUCTION MUST HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE MORE CONDUCT THAN BEAUTY
AN HE'S A STOUT-HEARTED FELLER TOO FOR WHEN WE SAW THE OLD TREE ALL AFIRE A-COMIN ACROSS THE FIELDS ONE NIGHT AN WE THOUGHT AS IT WAR A BOGUY SETH MADE NO MORE ADO BUT HE UP TO'T AS BOLD AS A CONSTABLE
GOOD-BYE MRS POYSER
SHE'S NEVER EASY BUT WHEN SHE'S HELPING SOMEBODY AND MARRIAGE UD INTERFERE WITH HER WAYS--THAT'S TRUE
HE WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE TAKEN A COMELY WIFE IN HIS YOUTH AND NOW WHEN HIS HAIR WAS GETTING GREY UNDER THE POWDER WOULD HAVE HAD TALL SONS AND BLOOMING DAUGHTERS--SUCH POSSESSIONS IN SHORT AS MEN COMMONLY THINK WILL REPAY THEM FOR ALL THE LABOUR THEY TAKE UNDER THE SUN
SHE HAD NO LONGING TO PUT THEM IN HER EARS NOW
AND IF SOLOMON WAS AS WISE AS HE IS REPUTED TO BE I FEEL SURE THAT WHEN HE COMPARED A CONTENTIOUS WOMAN TO A CONTINUAL DROPPING ON A VERY RAINY DAY HE HAD NOT A VIXEN IN HIS EYE--A FURY WITH LONG NAILS ACRID AND SELFISH
BARTLE ENTERED QUIETLY AND GOING UP TO ADAM GRASPED HIS HAND AND SAID I'M JUST COME TO LOOK AT YOU MY BOY FOR THE FOLKS ARE GONE OUT OF COURT FOR A BIT ADAM'S HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY HE WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK--HE COULD ONLY RETURN THE PRESSURE OF HIS FRIEND'S HAND--AND BARTLE DRAWING UP THE OTHER CHAIR CAME AND SAT IN FRONT OF HIM TAKING OFF HIS HAT AND HIS SPECTACLES
LISBETH NO SOONER ENTERED THE KITCHEN AND SAT DOWN THAN SHE THREW HER APRON OVER HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO CRY AND MOAN AND ROCK HERSELF AS BEFORE
IT WAS THE END OF ARTHUR'S LETTER ON WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN HIS ADDRESS
FAMILY LIKENESS HAS OFTEN A DEEP SADNESS IN IT
GOOD EVENING ADAM HASTENED WITH LONG STRIDES GYP CLOSE TO HIS HEELS OUT OF THE WORKYARD AND ALONG THE HIGHROAD LEADING AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND DOWN TO THE VALLEY
IT WAS NEARLY SEVEN BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED AND PUT ON HIS JACKET AGAIN
FOR AS FOR TH ARCHITECTS THEY SET UP TO BE FINE FELLOWS BUT THE MOST OF EM DON'T KNOW WHERE TO SET A CHIMNEY SO AS IT SHAN'T BE QUARRELLING WITH A DOOR
I FELT BEFORE THAT MY HEART WAS TOO STRONGLY DRAWN TOWARDS YOU AND THAT YOUR HEART WAS NOT AS MINE
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM AT LEAST A FINE BASS VOICE AND A MUSICAL EAR
BUT BY PUTTING OUR EYES CLOSE TO THE RUSTY BARS OF THE GATE WE CAN SEE THE HOUSE WELL ENOUGH AND ALL BUT THE VERY CORNERS OF THE GRASSY ENCLOSURE
I LIKE TO GO TO WORK BY A ROAD THAT'LL TAKE ME UP A BIT OF A HILL AND SEE THE FIELDS FOR MILES ROUND ME AND A BRIDGE OR A TOWN OR A BIT OF A STEEPLE HERE AND THERE
BUT HETTY OBJECTED TO IT BECAUSE IT HAD NUMEROUS DIM BLOTCHES SPRINKLED OVER THE MIRROR WHICH NO RUBBING WOULD REMOVE AND BECAUSE INSTEAD OF SWINGING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IT WAS FIXED IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SO THAT SHE COULD ONLY GET ONE GOOD VIEW OF HER HEAD AND NECK AND THAT WAS TO BE HAD ONLY BY SITTING DOWN ON A LOW CHAIR BEFORE HER DRESSING-TABLE
THAT LITTLE WISH SO NAIVELY UTTERED SEEMED TO HIM THE PRETTIEST BIT OF CHILDISHNESS
SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE BUT IT WAS QUITE PLAIN THE OLD SQUIRE COULD NEVER BE TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT IT FOR HETTY WAS READY TO FAINT WITH AWE AND FRIGHT IF SHE CAME ACROSS HIM AT THE CHASE
THE DOUBLE SUFFERING OF CERTAIN AND UNCERTAIN SORROW HAD BEGUN TO SHAKE THE STRONG MAN
AN IF THEE'ST SET THY HEART ON A LASS AS'LL BRING THEE NOUGHT AND WASTE ALL WHEN THEE MIGHTST HA THEM AS UD MAKE A MAN ON THEE I'LL SAY NOUGHT NOW THY FEYTHER'S DEAD AN DROWNDED FOR I'M NO BETTER NOR AN OLD HAFT WHEN THE BLADE'S GONE ADAM UNABLE TO BEAR THIS ANY LONGER ROSE SILENTLY FROM THE BENCH AND WALKED OUT OF THE WORKSHOP INTO THE KITCHEN
BUT MARTY RAN ON FIRST SHOUTING WE'VE FOUND THE SPECKLED TURKEY'S NEST MOTHER WITH THE INSTINCTIVE CONFIDENCE THAT PEOPLE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS ARE NEVER IN FAULT
AND NOW HE SAID RISING AGAIN I MUST SEE TO YOUR HAVING A BIT OF THE LOAF AND SOME OF THAT WINE MR IRWINE SENT THIS MORNING
HE SAW HER ALL THE MORE VIVIDLY AFTER LOOKING AT THE THOUGHTLESS FACES AND GAY-COLOURED DRESSES OF THE YOUNG WOMEN--JUST AS ONE FEELS THE BEAUTY AND THE GREATNESS OF A PICTURED MADONNA THE MORE WHEN IT HAS BEEN FOR A MOMENT SCREENED FROM US BY A VULGAR HEAD IN A BONNET
BUT BOTH STYLES OF WIT WERE TREATED WITH EQUAL CONTEMPT BY MR JOSHUA RANN
IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MRS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
SHE FELT TO THE FULL ALL THE MEANING THAT HAD LAIN IN ADAM'S WORDS AND AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF HIM AND TURNED BACK SLOWLY INTO THE HOUSE SHE SAID ALOUD TO HERSELF--FOR IT WAS HER WAY TO SPEAK HER THOUGHTS ALOUD IN THE LONG DAYS WHEN HER HUSBAND AND SONS WERE AT THEIR WORK--"EH HE'LL BE TELLIN ME AS HE'S GOIN TO BRING HER HOME ONE O THESE DAYS
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
TELL BRIDGET TO SAY I'LL GO UP AND SEE MISS ANNE PRESENTLY
HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW AND YOU CAN'T ALTER IT'S NATUR BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS
AND THEY ALL COLLOGUE TOGETHER THEM TRAMPS AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA COME AND POISONED THE DOGS AND MURDERED US ALL IN OUR BEDS AFORE WE KNOWED SOME FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN WE'N GOT THE MONEY IN TH HOUSE TO PAY THE MEN
YOU CANNA THINK O GETTING MARRIED AFORE EASTER
DINAH'S NOT FOR MARRYING
ON THE CONTRARY NO HEAD AND FACE COULD LOOK MORE SLEEK AND HEALTHY AND ITS EXPRESSION--WHICH WAS CHIEFLY CONFINED TO A PAIR OF ROUND AND RUDDY CHEEKS THE SLIGHT KNOT AND INTERRUPTIONS FORMING THE NOSE AND EYES BEING SCARCELY WORTH MENTION--WAS ONE OF JOLLY CONTENTMENT ONLY TEMPERED BY THAT SENSE OF PERSONAL DIGNITY WHICH USUALLY MADE ITSELF FELT IN HIS ATTITUDE AND BEARING
ONLY YOU COME AND HEAR HER AND YOU WON'T SPEAK LIGHTLY ON HER AGAIN WELL I'M HALF A MIND T HA A LOOK AT HER TO-NIGHT IF THERE ISN'T GOOD COMPANY AT TH HOLLY BUSH
CAN YOU PERSUADE HER TO STOP SOMEHOW
SINCE I'VE BEEN SPARED THAT I'VE NO RIGHT TO GRUMBLE
HE ALMOST STARTED WHEN HE SAW HER SMILING AS IF SHE WERE PLEASED TO SEE HIM--LOOKING THE SAME AS EVER AT A FIRST GLANCE ONLY THAT SHE HAD HER CAP ON WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN HER IN BEFORE WHEN HE CAME OF AN EVENING
WAS NOT HE TOO OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE HIS MOST CHERISHED HOPES
EVEN HETTY FELT SOMETHING LIKE CONTENTMENT IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS LOVE
IT IS THE GOOD NEWS THAT JESUS CAME TO PREACH TO THE POOR
HE COULD NEVER SPEAK QUITE PATIENTLY TO THE OLD BLOCKHEAD
HE HAD NO WARRANT FOR THE CERTAINTY THAT SHE WAS GONE TO ARTHUR
BUT THE REGULAR TIME IS FOUR BECAUSE THAT GIVES US TIME BEFORE MISS DONNITHORNE'S BELL RINGS AH THEN I MUST NOT KEEP YOU NOW ELSE I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE HERMITAGE
HE HAD DETERMINED TO MENTION NO FURTHER REASON
AND CLOSE UPON THAT DREAD CAME ANOTHER WHICH DEEPENED THE SHADOW
COME SIT YE DOWN SIT YE DOWN
AND THERE'S LITTLE LIKELIHOOD--FOR IT SEEMS AS IF THEM AS AREN'T WANTED HERE ARE TH ONLY FOLKS AS AREN'T WANTED I TH OTHER WORLD BUT THEE WUTNA LIKE MOVING FROM TH OLD PLACE THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MR POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY
FANCYING HERSELF AT THE EDGE OF A HIDDEN POOL LOW DOWN LIKE THAT IN THE SCANTLANDS
I'LL NEVER BE NO OTHER THAN A GOOD SON TO THEE AS LONG AS WE LIVE
BUT SHE'D NEVER IN HER LIFE SPENT A PENNY ON HERSELF MORE THAN KEEPING HERSELF DECENT SHE WAS A BLESSED WOMAN SAID DINAH
GOOD-BYE LAD SAID ADAM LAYING HIS HAND ON SETH'S SHOULDER AND LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO PART
AND I WENT RIGHT ON TILL I CAME TO A VILLAGE A LONG WAY OFF FROM THE WOOD AND I WAS VERY SICK AND FAINT AND HUNGRY
ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE
LET ME PICK THE CURRANTS UP THAT WAS SOON DONE FOR THEY HAD ONLY FALLEN IN A TANGLED MASS ON THE GRASS-PLOT AND ADAM AS HE ROSE AND GAVE HER THE BASIN AGAIN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO HER EYES WITH THE SUBDUED TENDERNESS THAT BELONGS TO THE FIRST MOMENTS OF HOPEFUL LOVE
FOR THEY WALKED IN SILENCE THOUGH WITH A PLEASED SENSE OF COMPANIONSHIP
HE GOES AS PAT TO THE MUSIC AS IF HE WAS MADE O CLOCKWORK
THERE WAS A SUNK FENCE IN FRONT OF THE MARQUEE DIVIDING THE LAWN FROM THE PARK BUT A TEMPORARY BRIDGE HAD BEEN MADE FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE VICTORS AND THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE STANDING OR SEATED HERE AND THERE ON BENCHES STRETCHED ON EACH SIDE OF THE OPEN SPACE FROM THE WHITE MARQUEES UP TO THE SUNK FENCE
I SAW THAT LONG AGO
THE BUTTER'S READY TO PACK UP NOW D YOU HEAR WHAT'S HAPPENED HETTY SAID HER AUNT
HOWEVER I'D BETTER NOT GO ANY FURTHER NOW
I HOPE Y ENJOYED THEM SPINACH AND GOOSEBERRIES AS I SENT CHESTER WITH TH OTHER DAY
HOW DO YOU DO MRS POYSER SAID ARTHUR
SHE CHOSE TO GO TO STRATFORD-ON-AVON AGAIN WHERE SHE HAD GONE BEFORE BY MISTAKE FOR SHE REMEMBERED SOME GRASSY FIELDS ON HER FORMER WAY TOWARDS IT--FIELDS AMONG WHICH SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT FIND JUST THE SORT OF POOL SHE HAD IN HER MIND
IN A MOMENT ADAM TURNED HIM ROUND SEIZED HIS OTHER SHOULDER AND PUSHING HIM ALONG PINNED HIM AGAINST THE WALL
HE DOESN'T MAKE HIMSELF PERSONALLY AGREEABLE TO HIS TENANTS
THE DAMP HAY THAT MUST BE SCATTERED AND TURNED AFRESH TO-MORROW WAS NOT A CHEERING SIGHT TO MR POYSER WHO DURING HAY AND CORN HARVEST HAD OFTEN SOME MENTAL STRUGGLES AS TO THE BENEFITS OF A DAY OF REST
AND THIS UNCERTAINTY WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM CONTRIVING A PRUDENT ANSWER HEIGHTENED HIS IRRITATION
A FOREMAN IF HE'S GOT A CONSCIENCE AND DELIGHTS IN HIS WORK WILL DO HIS BUSINESS AS WELL AS IF HE WAS A PARTNER
OLD JOHN'S WOODEN DEEP-WRINKLED FACE WAS THE FIRST OBJECT THAT MET ARTHUR'S EYES AS HE ENTERED THE STABLE-YARD AND IT QUITE POISONED FOR HIM THE BARK OF THE TWO BLOODHOUNDS THAT KEPT WATCH THERE
THEY ARE ISOLATED FROM ALL APPEALS BY A BARRIER OF DREAMS--BY INVISIBLE LOOKS AND IMPALPABLE ARMS
THE FOWLS WERE ALL GONE TO ROOST AND THE BULL-DOG LAY STRETCHED ON THE STRAW OUTSIDE HIS KENNEL WITH THE BLACK-AND-TAN TERRIER BY HIS SIDE WHEN THE FALLING-TO OF THE GATE DISTURBED THEM AND SET THEM BARKING LIKE GOOD OFFICIALS BEFORE THEY HAD ANY DISTINCT KNOWLEDGE OF THE REASON
AND HE'S LOST MORE BY ILL MANAGEMENT O THE WOODS I'LL BE BOUND THAN UD PAY FOR TWO STEWARDS
I MUN GO A BIT NEARER SEVERAL OF THE MEN FOLLOWED BEN'S LEAD AND THE TRAVELLER PUSHED HIS HORSE ON TO THE GREEN AS DINAH WALKED RATHER QUICKLY AND IN ADVANCE OF HER COMPANIONS TOWARDS THE CART UNDER THE MAPLE-TREE
BUT WHEN I'D GOT HER INTO MY HAND I WAS FORCED TO TAKE TO HER
HOWEVER SHE'S REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO ME FOR TEACHING HER SOMETHING TO GET HER BREAD WITH BETTER THAN FARM-HOUSE WORK
DINAH COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH HIM FOR IT
BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE HELD IT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE HIM
SHE MUST HA DONE SAID ADAM
IT UD BE A POOR TALE IF I HADNA FEATHERS AND LINEN SHE SAID HOARSELY WHEN I NEVER SELL A FOWL BUT WHAT'S PLUCKED AND THE WHEEL'S A-GOING EVERY DAY O THE WEEK COME MY WENCH SAID MR POYSER WHEN HETTY CAME DOWN COME AND KISS US AND LET US WISH YOU LUCK HETTY WENT VERY QUIETLY AND KISSED THE BIG GOOD-NATURED MAN
YOU KNOW WHO THE MEN WERE
BUT I WASN'T QUITE EASY WHAT I SHOULD DO ABOUT HER AND TOWARDS EVENING I MADE UP MY MIND I'D GO AFTER MEETING WAS OVER AND SPEAK TO OUR MINISTER ABOUT IT
AND IF FAIR ALLOWANCES WERE MADE TO THEM AND THEIR BUILDINGS ATTENDED TO ONE COULD PERSUADE THEM TO FARM ON A BETTER PLAN STUPID AS THEY ARE THEN MIND YOU FALL IN LOVE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND DON'T GET A WIFE WHO WILL DRAIN YOUR PURSE AND MAKE YOU NIGGARDLY IN SPITE OF YOURSELF
YET SHE WOULD LOOK NOW--SHE MIGHT BE MISTAKEN--FOR AFTER ALL SHE HAD NOT LOOKED
THROUGHOUT THE DAY EXCEPT IN HER OCCASIONAL OUTBURSTS OF WAILING GRIEF SHE HAD BEEN IN INCESSANT MOVEMENT PERFORMING THE INITIAL DUTIES TO HER DEAD WITH THE AWE AND EXACTITUDE THAT BELONG TO RELIGIOUS RITES
THE WHOLE THING WILL SOON BE FORGOTTEN NO BY GOD ADAM BURST OUT WITH RAGE THAT COULD BE CONTROLLED NO LONGER THROWING DOWN THE BASKET OF TOOLS AND STRIDING FORWARD TILL HE WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ARTHUR
I HAVE NOT SEEN IT FOR YEARS AND I HEAR ON ALL HANDS ABOUT YOUR FINE CHEESE AND BUTTER SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING POLITELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT THERE COULD BE ANY QUESTION ON WHICH HE AND MRS POYSER MIGHT HAPPEN TO DISAGREE
SHE KNEW STILL BETTER THAT ADAM BEDE--TALL UPRIGHT CLEVER BRAVE ADAM BEDE--WHO CARRIED SUCH AUTHORITY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT AND WHOM HER UNCLE WAS ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO SEE OF AN EVENING SAYING THAT ADAM KNEW A FINE SIGHT MORE O THE NATUR O THINGS THAN THOSE AS THOUGHT THEMSELVES HIS BETTERS"--SHE KNEW THAT THIS ADAM WHO WAS OFTEN RATHER STERN TO OTHER PEOPLE AND NOT MUCH GIVEN TO RUN AFTER THE LASSES COULD BE MADE TO TURN PALE OR RED ANY DAY BY A WORD OR A LOOK FROM HER
I HEAR YOU ARE GOING AWAY SOON
AND I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF YOUNG HEROES OF MIDDLE STATURE AND FEEBLE BEARDS WHO HAVE FELT QUITE SURE THEY COULD NEVER LOVE ANYTHING MORE INSIGNIFICANT THAN A DIANA AND YET HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN MIDDLE LIFE HAPPILY SETTLED WITH A WIFE WHO WADDLES
THERE'S NE'ER BEEN NOBODY ASKING FOR HER TILL YOU COME FOR THE FOLKS ABOUT KNOW AS SHE'S GONE
IS IT BECAUSE THE BRUTES ARE DUMB
HOORRAY SHOUTED A SMALL LITHE FELLOW CALLED WIRY BEN RUNNING FORWARD AND SEIZING THE DOOR
FOR ARTHUR HAD IMPRESSED ON HETTY THAT IT WOULD BE FATAL TO BETRAY BY WORD OR LOOK THAT THERE HAD BEEN THE LEAST INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM
I'D MADE A FRAME FOR A SCREEN FOR MISS LYDDY--SHE'S ALLAYS MAKING SOMETHING WITH HER WORSTED-WORK YOU KNOW--AND SHE'D GIVEN ME PARTICULAR ORDERS ABOUT THIS SCREEN AND THERE WAS AS MUCH TALKING AND MEASURING AS IF WE'D BEEN PLANNING A HOUSE
SO HE GAVE HIS HAND TO BURGE ON THAT BARGAIN AND WENT HOME WITH HIS MIND FULL OF HAPPY VISIONS IN WHICH MY REFINED READER WILL PERHAPS BE SHOCKED WHEN I SAY IT THE IMAGE OF HETTY HOVERED AND SMILED OVER PLANS FOR SEASONING TIMBER AT A TRIFLING EXPENSE CALCULATIONS AS TO THE CHEAPENING OF BRICKS PER THOUSAND BY WATER-CARRIAGE AND A FAVOURITE SCHEME FOR THE STRENGTHENING OF ROOFS AND WALLS WITH A PECULIAR FORM OF IRON GIRDER
THOUGH IT'S THE SQUIRE HIMSELF AS IS TO BLAME--MAKING A STUPID FELLOW LIKE THAT A SORT O MAN-OF-ALL-WORK JUST TO SAVE TH EXPENSE OF HAVING A PROPER STEWARD TO LOOK AFTER TH ESTATE
BUT ADAM'S THOUGHTS OF HETTY DID NOT DEAFEN HIM TO THE SERVICE
THE WAY LAY ENTIRELY THROUGH MR POYSER'S OWN FIELDS TILL THEY REACHED THE MAIN ROAD LEADING TO THE VILLAGE AND HE TURNED A KEEN EYE ON THE STOCK AND THE CROPS AS THEY WENT ALONG WHILE MRS POYSER WAS READY TO SUPPLY A RUNNING COMMENTARY ON THEM ALL
STONITON WAS THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE FOR HETTY TO GO TO FIRST WHATEVER MIGHT BE HER DESTINATION FOR SHE WOULD HARDLY VENTURE ON ANY BUT THE CHIEF COACH-ROADS
I NEVER HAD A GELL COME INTO MY HOUSE AS SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT CLEANING WAS
BEHIND THIS LAST COUPLE CAME MR IRWINE GLAD AT HEART OVER THIS GOOD MORNING'S WORK OF JOINING ADAM AND DINAH
THE WHOLE THING HAD BEEN SECRET
HE WILL PERHAPS TURN ROUND BY AND BY AND IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN LOOK AT THAT STATELY OLD LADY HIS MOTHER A BEAUTIFUL AGED BRUNETTE WHOSE RICH-TONED COMPLEXION IS WELL SET OFF BY THE COMPLEX WRAPPINGS OF PURE WHITE CAMBRIC AND LACE ABOUT HER HEAD AND NECK
IT IS A BEAUTY LIKE THAT OF KITTENS OR VERY SMALL DOWNY DUCKS MAKING GENTLE RIPPLING NOISES WITH THEIR SOFT BILLS OR BABIES JUST BEGINNING TO TODDLE AND TO ENGAGE IN CONSCIOUS MISCHIEF--A BEAUTY WITH WHICH YOU CAN NEVER BE ANGRY BUT THAT YOU FEEL READY TO CRUSH FOR INABILITY TO COMPREHEND THE STATE OF MIND INTO WHICH IT THROWS YOU
ARTHUR WENT IN FOR THE SAKE OF PATTING MEG DECLINING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO SEE ANYTHING IN THE STABLES LEST HE SHOULD LOSE HIS TEMPER BEFORE BREAKFAST
LET US KNEEL DOWN TOGETHER FOR WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD HETTY OBEYED DINAH'S MOVEMENT AND SANK ON HER KNEES
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE WOODEN HEADS YOU KNOW IT CAN'T BE HELPED
AND SHE'S ONE--SHE'S ONE
IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE HONOURS GIVEN TO THE TWO PARISHES MISS IRWINE DANCED WITH LUKE BRITTON THE LARGEST BROXTON FARMER AND MR GAWAINE LED OUT MRS BRITTON
IN A PIECE OF MACHINERY TOO I BELIEVE THERE IS OFTEN A SMALL UNNOTICEABLE WHEEL WHICH HAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH THE MOTION OF THE LARGE OBVIOUS ONES
AN IT'LL BE ALL YOUR FAULT DINAH AUNT SAID DINAH I PROMISE TO COME BACK TO YOU IN THE WINTER IF YOU'RE ILL
HE LINGERED BECAUSE HE WANTED TO SEE HER SAFELY THROUGH THAT EVENING AND HE WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND HOW MUCH SELF-COMMAND SHE SHOWED
CANDOUR WAS ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE VIRTUES
IT WAS RAINING AND SHE MUST TRY TO GET ON TO A VILLAGE WHERE SHE MIGHT FIND REST AND SHELTER
IT WAS AN EXPRESSION OF UNCONSCIOUS PLACID GRAVITY--OF ABSORPTION IN THOUGHTS THAT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT OR WITH HER OWN PERSONALITY--AN EXPRESSION THAT IS MOST OF ALL DISCOURAGING TO A LOVER
I'M SURE YOURS IS OH VERY WELL SAID HETTY WITH A LITTLE PLAYFUL POUT TAKING THE ROSE OUT OF HER HAIR
BABIES WERE SO LIABLE TO DEATH--AND THERE MIGHT BE THE STRONGEST SUSPICIONS WITHOUT ANY PROOF OF GUILT
BUT HE WENT TO THE HALL FARM TO TELL THEM ALL HE COULD SUGGEST ABOUT THE ADDRESS OF THE LETTER AND WARN THEM THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME DELAY IN THE DELIVERY FROM HIS NOT KNOWING AN EXACT DIRECTION
MEANWHILE THE CONVERSATION AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE HAD TAKEN A POLITICAL TURN
NO NO MOTHER SAID MR IRWINE
EXULTATION THAT SHE WAS STILL IN LIFE--THAT SHE MIGHT YET KNOW LIGHT AND WARMTH AGAIN
AND SETH WHO COULD NEVER ABIDE ANYTHING HARSH AND WAS ALWAYS FOR HOPING THE BEST HELD FAST BY THE WESLEYANS FROM THE VERY FIRST
MOREOVER ON THE MOST CHARITABLE SUPPOSITION HE MUST BE FAR ON THE WAY TO FORTY
SHE HAD NOT SOUGHT THEE
AND IF HE CHANCES TO LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE YEARS PROBABLY IMAGINES HIMSELF BEING VIRTUOUSLY TENDER TO HER BECAUSE THE POOR THING IS SO CLINGINGLY FOND OF HIM
AND YET THERE REMAINED AN UNEASY FEELING IN HIS MIND THAT HE HAD NOT SAID QUITE THE RIGHT THING--THAT SOMEHOW DINAH HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD HIM
I'VE ALWAYS KEPT WHAT I FELT FOR HER AS SECRET AS I COULD HE PAUSED AGAIN BEFORE HE WENT ON
YOU MIGHT HAPPEN PERSUADE HER WI TELLING HER AS HER AUNT WANTS HER FOR ALL SHE WRITES O NOT BEING ABLE TO COME HETTY HAD NOT LIKED THE THOUGHT OF GOING TO SNOWFIELD AND FELT NO LONGING TO SEE DINAH SO SHE ONLY SAID IT'S SO FAR OFF UNCLE BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THIS PROPOSED VISIT WOULD SERVE AS A PRETEXT FOR GOING AWAY
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN AN THAT'S WHAT WE ALL MEAN
HE INTENDS TO REMAIN AT STONITON TILL AFTER THE TRIAL
IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO PART FROM HER--HARDER STILL FOR ME TO WRITE WORDS WHICH MAY SEEM UNKIND THOUGH THEY SPRING FROM THE TRUEST KINDNESS
IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF YOUNG FRISKING THINGS ROUND-LIMBED GAMBOLLING CIRCUMVENTING YOU BY A FALSE AIR OF INNOCENCE--THE INNOCENCE OF A YOUNG STAR-BROWED CALF FOR EXAMPLE THAT BEING INCLINED FOR A PROMENADE OUT OF BOUNDS LEADS YOU A SEVERE STEEPLECHASE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH AND ONLY COMES TO A STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A BOG
HE EXPECTED THIS FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD MET HIM SINCE SHE HAD BEEN AWARE THAT HE HAD SEEN HER WITH ARTHUR IN THE GROVE
I LOOK FOR ME AND SETH TO GET A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR OURSELVES I THAT WAY FOR I KNOW A MAN AT ROSSETER AS ULL TAKE AS MANY THINGS AS WE SHOULD MAKE BESIDES WHAT WE COULD GET ORDERS FOR ROUND ABOUT MR POYSER ENTERED WITH INTEREST INTO A PROJECT WHICH SEEMED A STEP TOWARDS ADAM'S BECOMING A MASTER-MAN AND MRS POYSER GAVE HER APPROBATION TO THE SCHEME OF THE MOVABLE KITCHEN CUPBOARD WHICH WAS TO BE CAPABLE OF CONTAINING GROCERY PICKLES CROCKERY AND HOUSE-LINEN IN THE UTMOST COMPACTNESS WITHOUT CONFUSION
HE HAD JUST GONE INTO THE WORKSHOP WHEN HIS QUICK EAR DETECTED A LIGHT RAPID FOOT ON THE STAIRS--CERTAINLY NOT HIS MOTHER'S
CHARLOTTE'S HER CHRISTENED NAME
AND YET I SOMETIMES THINK HE POSITIVELY HATES ME BECAUSE I'M HIS HEIR
I BELIEVE HE MEANS TO DO ALL THE BUSINESS HIMSELF AND HAVE NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A STEWARD
HOW WAS IT I WANTED TO SEE DINAH--SHE'S GOING AWAY SO SOON SAID ADAM
TOTTY UD GET HER FEET WET SAID MRS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
I'N GOT NO LONG WHILE T LIVE
AND I USED TO LIKE BREAKFASTING WITH YOU SO WHEN I WAS READING WITH YOU
FOR WAS IT NOT WRITTEN IN THE VERY PSALM THEY WERE SINGING THAT THE DIVINE DEALINGS WERE NOT MEASURED AND CIRCUMSCRIBED BY TIME
I UNDERSTAND YOU LEFT HIM AT STONITON AND I BEG THE FAVOUR OF YOU TO TELL ME WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE POOR LAD'S MIND AND WHAT HE MEANS TO DO
BUT TELL ME ABOUT ADAM
THEE MAY'ST BE QUITE DECEIVED ABOUT DINAH
AND WOULD DINAH COME TOO
YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS BUT I TELL YOU FOR ONCE AS WE'RE NOT DUMB CREATURES TO BE ABUSED AND MADE MONEY ON BY THEM AS HA GOT THE LASH I THEIR HANDS FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
LOVE OF THIS SORT IS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM RELIGIOUS FEELING
THOSE BEECHES AND SMOOTH LIMES--THERE WAS SOMETHING ENERVATING IN THE VERY SIGHT OF THEM
KEEP QUIET
THAT WAS THE LAST DROP IN THE CUP OF BITTERNESS
AND OVER ALL STREAMED THE DELICIOUS JUNE SUNSHINE THROUGH THE OLD WINDOWS WITH THEIR DESULTORY PATCHES OF YELLOW RED AND BLUE THAT THREW PLEASANT TOUCHES OF COLOUR ON THE OPPOSITE WALL
HE HURRIED HIS STEP ALONG THE NARROW CAUSEWAY AND RAPPED AT THE DOOR
WHERE HAST BEEN SAID ADAM WHEN THEY WERE SIDE BY SIDE
YET ADAM KNEW WHAT THEY MEANT ALL THE BETTER AND THE TWO HONEST MEN GRASPED EACH OTHER'S HARD HANDS IN MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
AND AS FOR KNOWLEDGE AND CONTRIVANCES AND MANUFACTURES THERE'S A MANY THINGS AS WE'RE A FINE SIGHT BEHIND EM IN
HE CALLED HIS LOVE FRANKLY A MYSTERY AS YOU HAVE HEARD HIM
BUT EH POOR THING AS SOON AS SHE'D SAID US GOOD-BYE AN GOT INTO THE CART AN LOOKED BACK AT ME WITH HER PALE FACE AS IS WELLY LIKE HER AUNT JUDITH COME BACK FROM HEAVEN I BEGUN TO BE FRIGHTENED TO THINK O THE SET-DOWNS I'D GIVEN HER
IF SHE COULD BUT THROW HERSELF INTO THE WATER
TRY TO GET SOME REST TO-NIGHT
AND SHE SAYS SUCH SHARP THINGS TOO SHARP
SO BE READY BY HALF-PAST ELEVEN THE LOW WHISTLE WHICH HAD ASSISTED HIM IN ARRIVING AT THIS RESOLUTION HERE BROKE OUT INTO HIS LOUDEST RINGING TENOR AND THE CORRIDOR AS HE HURRIED ALONG IT ECHOED TO HIS FAVOURITE SONG FROM THE BEGGAR'S OPERA WHEN THE HEART OF A MAN IS OPPRESSED WITH CARE NOT AN HEROIC STRAIN
YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER FOR HIM SAID MR IRWINE LAUGHING
SHE SAT LEANING HER ELBOW ON THE BASKET
THE BURLY OLD COACHMAN FROM OAKBOURNE SEEING SUCH A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN AMONG THE OUTSIDE PASSENGERS HAD INVITED HER TO COME AND SIT BESIDE HIM
SHE THINKS THERE'S NOTHING BELONGS TO BEING A LADY'S MAID BUT WEARING FINER CLOTHES NOR SHE WAS BORN TO I'LL BE BOUND
THE THINGS WERE GEV TO HER
HOW DURST YOU SAY SO SAID HETTY PAUSING IN HER WALK AND TREMBLING
YOUR TRUE RUSTIC TURNS HIS BACK ON HIS INTERLOCUTOR THROWING A QUESTION OVER HIS SHOULDER AS IF HE MEANT TO RUN AWAY FROM THE ANSWER AND WALKING A STEP OR TWO FARTHER OFF WHEN THE INTEREST OF THE DIALOGUE CULMINATES
PITY IT WAS NOT A BOARDED FLOOR
IDLE TALK SAID MR JOSHUA RANN
IN THIS SORT OF THING PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY CONFOUNDING LIBERALITY WITH RIOT AND DISORDER
BUT UNLESS HE COULD MANAGE BOTH VISITS THIS LAST MUST BE PUT OFF TILL TO-MORROW--THE DESIRE TO BE NEAR HETTY AND TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN WAS TOO STRONG
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THEN ARTHUR WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEHAVED AS WISELY AS HE HAD INTENDED
IF THEE WOULDST PRAY TO GOD TO HELP THEE AND TRUST IN HIS GOODNESS THEE WOULDSTNA BE SO UNEASY ABOUT THINGS UNAISY
HE'LL BE FOR LAYING BY BUSINESS SOON I'LL WARRANT AND BE WANTING YOU TO TAKE TO IT ALL AND PAY HIM SO MUCH BY TH EAR
ELEVEN O'CLOCK'S LATE WHY I SIT UP TILL AFTER TWELVE OFTEN SAID ADAM LAUGHING BUT IT ISN'T T EAT AND DRINK EXTRY IT'S TO WORK EXTRY
ARE THEIR FIRST POEMS THEIR BEST
IT MUST BE WON BY A FAIR AMOUNT OF MERIT
IT'LL BE HARDER NOR EVER TO DIE AN LEAVE THE LITTLE UNS AN NOBODY TO BE A MOTHER TO EM WE'D BETTER HA SENT FOR DINAH IF WE'D KNOWN WHERE SHE IS SAID MR POYSER
HERE SHE ASKED THE LANDLORD IF HE COULD TELL HER WHAT PLACES SHE MUST GO TO TO GET TO WINDSOR
AND NO OFFICIAL WALKING IN PROCESSION COULD LOOK MORE RESOLUTELY UNCONSCIOUS OF ALL ACQUAINTANCES THAN GYP WITH HIS BASKET TROTTING AT HIS MASTER'S HEELS
DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE'S LIKELY TO BE AT LIBERTY WHY SIR YOU CAN HARDLY MISS HIM EXCEPT IT'S O TREDDLES'ON MARKET-DAY--THAT'S OF A FRIDAY YOU KNOW
GOOD-NIGHT
BUT THERE'S NO KNOWING--PERHAPS NOTHING UD BE A LESSON TO US IF IT DIDN'T COME TOO LATE
THAT WAS NOT HIS USUAL WAY OF SALUTING THE SCHOOLMASTER BUT TROUBLE MAKES US TREAT ALL WHO FEEL WITH US VERY MUCH ALIKE
PERHAPS YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME HETTY BECAUSE YOU THINK TOO WELL OF HIM--BECAUSE YOU THINK HE LOVES YOU BETTER THAN HE DOES
THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE IS OPEN AND AN ELDERLY WOMAN IS LOOKING OUT
MR POYSER HAD ONCE SUGGESTED THAT THE HOUSE SHOULD BE SHUT UP AND LEFT TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF
THEY DON'T MEAN AS WE SHOULD BE IDLE
FOR I WONNA STAY UPO THAT MAN'S LAND A DAY LONGER NOR I'M FORCED TO'T
SUCH SOFT COLOURING OF RED EARTHENWARE AND CREAMY SURFACES BROWN WOOD AND POLISHED TIN GREY LIMESTONE AND RICH ORANGE-RED RUST ON THE IRON WEIGHTS AND HOOKS AND HINGES
AND SO THERE WAS EARNEST PRAYER--THERE WAS FAITH LOVE AND HOPE POURING FORTH THAT EVENING IN THE LITTLE KITCHEN
IF THERE HAD BEEN A POSSIBILITY OF MAKING ADAM TENFOLD AMENDS--IF DEEDS OF GIFT OR ANY OTHER DEEDS COULD HAVE RESTORED ADAM'S CONTENTMENT AND REGARD FOR HIM AS A BENEFACTOR ARTHUR WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE EXECUTED THEM WITHOUT HESITATION BUT WOULD HAVE FELT BOUND ALL THE MORE CLOSELY TO ADAM AND WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WEARY OF MAKING RETRIBUTION
BUT I'VE ALWAYS MISTRUSTED THAT SORT O LEARNING AS LEAVES FOLKS FOOLISH AND UNREASONABLE ABOUT BUSINESS
FOR LISBETH IS TALL AND IN OTHER POINTS TOO THERE IS A STRONG LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER SON ADAM
THEN I WISH HE WAR LET BLOOD FOR T THAT'S ALL SAID JOHN GRIMLY
AND I FOUND IT BETTER FOR MY SOUL TO BE HUMBLE BEFORE THE MYSTERIES O GOD'S DEALINGS AND NOT BE MAKING A CLATTER ABOUT WHAT I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING LOVELIER FOR THE YESTERDAY'S RAIN
AND AS HE SAYS MAKING WHAT WAS A WILD COUNTRY ALL OF THE SAME DARK HUE BRIGHT AND VARIEGATED WITH CORN AND CATTLE
ARE YOU GOING TO BE A LADY'S MAID I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ONE VERY MUCH INDEED HETTY SPOKE MORE AUDIBLY NOW BUT STILL RATHER TREMULOUSLY
BUT NOW SHE TURNS AWAY FROM THE SUNLIGHT AND LOOKS TOWARDS THE DOOR
AND THEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
IT WAS BETTER IT SHOULD BE SO HE SAID AS QUIETLY AS HE COULD IF SHE FELT SHE COULDN'T LIKE ME FOR A HUSBAND
FOR THE MOMENTS WERE FEW AND PRECIOUS NOW IN WHICH SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SMALLEST OFFICE OF RESPECT OR LOVE FOR THE STILL CORPSE TO WHICH IN ALL HER THOUGHTS SHE ATTRIBUTED SOME CONSCIOUSNESS
AND NOW HE MIGHT GIVE HIMSELF UP TO THINKING HOW IMMENSELY AGREEABLE IT WOULD BE IF CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DIFFERENT--HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MEET HER THIS EVENING AS SHE CAME BACK AND PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER AGAIN AND LOOK INTO HER SWEET FACE
I'LL GO AND SEE IT AGAIN TO-NIGHT FOR THE LAST TIME HE SAID
AND MRS POYSER HAS SPOKEN HER MIND PRETTY STRONGLY AS TO THE DIRT WHICH THE EXTRA NUMBER OF MEN'S SHOES BROUGHT INTO THE HOUSE AT DINNERTIME
I CAME TO FETCH HER BACK
WHAT GOOD IS THERE IN TAKING ALL THESE PAINS TO GIVE AN EXACT LIKENESS OF OLD WOMEN AND CLOWNS
AND I COUNT IT A GREAT THING AS I'VE HAD BARTLE MASSEY'S NIGHT-SCHOOL TO GO TO
YE'VE GOT A'MOST THE FACE O ONE AS IS A-SITTIN ON THE GRAVE I ADAM'S NEW BIBLE I COME FROM THE HALL FARM NOW
THE VERY ROSE-TREES AT WHICH ADAM STOPPED TO PLUCK ONE LOOKED AS IF THEY GREW WILD
I SHOULD NOT THINK OF ENCOURAGING A LOVE OF FINERY IN YOUNG WOMEN OF THAT CLASS
DEAR ARTHUR I SHALL LIVE NOW TO SEE HIM MASTER AT THE CHASE AND MAKING GOOD TIMES ON THE ESTATE LIKE A GENEROUS-HEARTED FELLOW AS HE IS
MRS POYSER TOO HAS ON A BLACK GOWN WHICH SEEMS TO HEIGHTEN THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND DINAH
I'VE NOT TOLD MY MOTHER YET AND THERE'S NO KNOWING HOW THINGS MAY TURN OUT AYE AYE
THERE'S THAT BESSY CRANAGE--SHE'LL BE FLAUNTING I NEW FINERY THREE WEEKS AFTER YOU'RE GONE I'LL BE BOUND
IF I DIDNA THINK ON EM WHY SHOULD I DO AS I DO FOR THE SAKE O KEEPING THINGS TOGETHER HERE
MR POYSER THOUGHT SHE LOOKED THE PRETTIER FOR IT
BUT BY THE TIME HE GOT TO STONITON THE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AND SETH LEFT BEHIND TO ENDURE EVERYTHING WITHOUT HIM BECAME TOO IMPORTUNATE AND HIS RESOLUTION FAILED HIM
ADAM WINCED AND MOVED UNEASILY
I'VE NEVER DINED HERE BEFORE BUT I COME BY CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S WISH AND I HOPE IT'S NOT DISAGREEABLE TO ANYBODY HERE NAY NAY SAID SEVERAL VOICES AT ONCE WE'RE GLAD YE'RE COME
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF THREE ROUGH ANIMALS WERE MAKING HUMBLE EFFORTS TO LEARN HOW THEY MIGHT BECOME HUMAN
HER JOURNEY SHE SAID HAD COST HER MUCH MORE THAN SHE EXPECTED AND NOW SHE HAD NO MONEY TO GET BACK TO HER FRIENDS WHICH SHE WANTED TO DO AT ONCE
BUT HEARD FROM FAR OFF IT MINGLES VERY PRETTILY WITH THE OTHER JOYOUS SOUNDS OF NATURE
AND SO I FEEL SURE YOU WILL COME BEFORE ME SHE PAUSED A MOMENT BUT HETTY SAID NOTHING
HE WAS STRIDING ALONG AT HIS USUAL RAPID PACE AND ARTHUR PUSHED ON HIS HORSE TO OVERTAKE HIM FOR HE RETAINED TOO MUCH OF HIS BOYISH FEELING FOR ADAM TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY OF CHATTING WITH HIM
THAT WAS THE ONLY CHANGE IN THEIR MANNER TO EACH OTHER SINCE THEY WERE LAST WALKING TOGETHER
IT MAY BE A SMART TO HER NOW BUT IT'LL SAVE HER PAIN I TH END
SUCH A PRETTY LASS AS YOU CAN GET A SWEETHEART ANY DAY HETTY'S FEAR WAS ALLAYED BY AND BY WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THE COACHMAN MADE NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO HER PERSONAL CONCERNS
DO YOU REALLY LOVE ME HETTY
I NEVER MEANT TO INJURE HER
DEAR DEAR HETTY SWEET AS OUR LOVE HAS BEEN TO ME SWEET AS IT WOULD BE TO ME FOR YOU TO LOVE ME ALWAYS I FEEL THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR US BOTH IF WE HAD NEVER HAD THAT HAPPINESS AND THAT IT IS MY DUTY TO ASK YOU TO LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN
MARY BURGE INDEED
I KNOW IT IS PAINFUL TO YOU TO MEET ME ARTHUR WENT ON BUT IT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN FOR YEARS TO COME NO SIR SAID ADAM COLDLY THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT TO WRITE TO YOU TO-MORROW AS IT WOULD BE BETTER ALL DEALINGS SHOULD BE AT AN END BETWEEN US AND SOMEBODY ELSE PUT IN MY PLACE ARTHUR FELT THE ANSWER KEENLY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT AN EFFORT THAT HE SPOKE AGAIN
FOR HETTV HAD THE PRIDE NOT ONLY OF A PROUD NATURE BUT OF A PROUD CLASS--THE CLASS THAT PAYS THE MOST POOR-RATES AND MOST SHUDDERS AT THE IDEA OF PROFITING BY A POOR-RATE
SHE KISSED THE SOBBING THING AND BEGAN TO CRY WITH HER FOR GRATEFUL JOY
AND HE WENT INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AGAIN TO TEND HIS LITTLE FIRE HOPING THAT HE SHOULD PRESENTLY INDUCE HER TO HAVE SOME TEA
THE LAND SEEMED TO DIP DOWN A LITTLE AND TWO TREES LEANED TOWARDS EACH OTHER ACROSS THE OPENING
HIS WIFE IT APPEARS IS NOT A CLEVER DAIRY-WOMAN LIKE YOURS
AND I KNOW THERE S A DEAL IN A MAN'S INWARD LIFE AS YOU CAN'T MEASURE BY THE SQUARE AND SAY DO THIS AND THAT LL FOLLOW AND DO THAT AND THIS LL FOLLOW THERE'S THINGS GO ON IN THE SOUL AND TIMES WHEN FEELINGS COME INTO YOU LIKE A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND AS THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AND PART YOUR LIFE IN TWO A'MOST SO YOU LOOK BACK ON YOURSELF AS IF YOU WAS SOMEBODY ELSE
I MUST HASTEN BACK TO HER FOR IT IS WONDERFUL HOW SHE CLINGS NOW AND WAS NOT WILLING TO LET ME OUT OF HER SIGHT
BUT KNOWLEDGE ISN'T TO BE GOT WITH PAYING SIXPENCE LET ME TELL YOU
ANGER LAY VERY CLOSE TO DISAPPOINTMENT AND SOON WON THE VICTORY OVER THE CONJECTURES HER SMALL INGENUITY COULD DEVISE TO ACCOUNT FOR ARTHUR'S ABSENCE ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT HE REALLY WANTED TO COME REALLY WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN
THE WINDOW AND DOOR WERE OPEN AND THE MORNING AIR BROUGHT WITH IT A MINGLED SCENT OF SOUTHERNWOOD THYME AND SWEET-BRIAR FROM THE PATCH OF GARDEN BY THE SIDE OF THE COTTAGE
HER BLUSH HAD SUBSIDED AND SHE MET HIS GLANCE WITH A QUIET SADNESS WHICH CONTENTED ADAM BECAUSE IT WAS SO UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAD SEEN IN HER BEFORE
THAT MEETING BETWEEN THE BROTHERS WHERE ESAU IS SO LOVING AND GENEROUS AND JACOB SO TIMID AND DISTRUSTFUL NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SENSE OF THE DIVINE FAVOUR HAS ALWAYS TOUCHED ME GREATLY
ADAM SAT DOWN OPPOSITE HER IN MR POYSER'S THREE-CORNERED CHAIR
DID ANYBODY ELSE GO INTO FITS NO SIR I CANNA SAY AS THEY DID
IF HE HAD BUT SOME SORT OF STRENGTH THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO RESCUE HER POOR TROUBLED MIND AS HE WOULD HAVE RESCUED HER BODY IN THE FACE OF ALL DANGER
IT WAS ONLY THE SIGN OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE DESIRE FOR HIM TO NOTICE HER AND THE DREAD LEST SHE SHOULD BETRAY THE DESIRE TO OTHERS
BUT DINAH HAD NOT LEFT ANY ADDRESS AND THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE MEMORY FOR NAMES WAS INFIRM COULD NOT RECALL THE NAME OF THE BLESSED WOMAN WHO WAS DINAH'S CHIEF FRIEND IN THE SOCIETY AT LEEDS
THE NEWS WILL BE GOOD SAUCE TO MY DINNER
AND THEN MY HEART IS DRAWN OUT TOWARDS THEM AND I FEEL THEIR LOT AS IF IT WAS MY OWN AND I TAKE COMFORT IN SPREADING IT BEFORE THE LORD AND RESTING IN HIS LOVE ON THEIR BEHALF AS WELL AS MY OWN
SHAN'T I CARRY THE THOUGHT OF HER ABOUT WITH ME AS MUCH AS YOU WILL
AND WHEN THEY ENTERED THE JAILER'S ROOM SHE LAID THEM DOWN ON A CHAIR UNTHINKINGLY
IT WAS THE READING OF OUR FRIEND JOSHUA RANN
I KNOW IT'S A GRIT HONOUR FOR THEE TO BE SO LOOKED ON--AN WHO'S TO BE PROUDER ON IT NOR THY MOTHER
MAKE HASTE AND GET INTO BED
SHE WAS NOT QUITE CERTAIN OF A DIVINE DIRECTION
CHURCH
HE HAD BEEN EARNESTLY DESIRING FOR MONTHS THAT SHE SHOULD MARRY ADAM AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CONTRIBUTED MORE TO HIS HAPPINESS IN THESE MOMENTS THAN THE THOUGHT OF THEIR MARRIAGE
THE HERMITAGE STOOD IN FIR-TREE GROVE--THE WAY HETTY WAS SURE TO COME IN WALKING FROM THE HALL FARM
BUT TILL THEN I'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO BUT TO TRUST TO MY OWN HANDS AND MY OWN HEAD-PIECE
YOU AND I ARE INDEBTED TO THE HARD HANDS OF SUCH MEN--HANDS THAT HAVE LONG AGO MINGLED WITH THE SOIL THEY TILLED SO FAITHFULLY THRIFTILY MAKING THE BEST THEY COULD OF THE EARTH'S FRUITS AND RECEIVING THE SMALLEST SHARE AS THEIR OWN WAGES
THE WIDER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THE LESS HARM THERE IS FOR THEN SHE'S NOT LIKELY TO DECEIVE HERSELF I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY FLIRTING SAID ADAM BUT IF YOU MEAN BEHAVING TO A WOMAN AS IF YOU LOVED HER AND YET NOT LOVING HER ALL THE WHILE I SAY THAT'S NOT TH ACTION OF AN HONEST MAN AND WHAT ISN'T HONEST DOES COME T HARM
THE GOOD LANDLADY WAS AMAZED WHEN SHE SAW HETTY COME DOWNSTAIRS SOON AFTER HERSELF NEATLY DRESSED AND LOOKING RESOLUTELY SELF-POSSESSED
YOUR MISSIS THERE MIGHT LIKE HER FLOORS DIRTED WI WHITTAWS FOR WHAT I KNOW
HE HAS GONE THROUGH ALL THAT GREAT AGONY IN THE GARDEN WHEN HIS SOUL WAS EXCEEDING SORROWFUL EVEN UNTO DEATH AND THE GREAT DROPS OF SWEAT FELL LIKE BLOOD TO THE GROUND
THAT IS SETH BEDE ADAM'S BROTHER--A METHODIST BUT A VERY GOOD FELLOW
CHAPTER XXXII MRS POYSER HAS HER SAY OUT THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY--NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP-BOOTS SAID BY SOME TO BE A MERE FARMER IN TREATY FOR THE CHASE FARM BY OTHERS TO BE THE FUTURE STEWARD BUT BY MR CASSON HIMSELF THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM
HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE IT IS CERTAIN THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE ACCIDENT REFERRED TO WHICH WAS COINCIDENT WITH THE ARRIVAL OF AN AWAKENING METHODIST PREACHER AT TREDDLESTON A GREAT CHANGE HAD BEEN OBSERVED IN THE BRICKMAKER
BUT THE DINNER WAS GOOD AN IF THERE'S ANYBODY HASNA ENJOYED IT IT MUST BE THE FAULT OF HIS OWN INSIDE
WHERE'S SETH
HE HURRIED TO THE HERMITAGE WHICH STOOD IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD UNLOCKED THE DOOR WITH A HASTY WRENCH SLAMMED IT AFTER HIM PITCHED ZELUCO INTO THE MOST DISTANT CORNER AND THRUSTING HIS RIGHT HAND INTO HIS POCKET FIRST WALKED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES UP AND DOWN THE SCANTY LENGTH OF THE LITTLE ROOM AND THEN SEATED HIMSELF ON THE OTTOMAN IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE STIFF WAY AS WE OFTEN DO WHEN WE WISH NOT TO ABANDON OURSELVES TO FEELING
BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR AND ADAM ROSE FROM THE STONE WALL
FOR A LONG WHILE DINAH HAD SAID FOR SHE HAD TOLD LISBETH OF HER RESOLVE
HE COULD PROBABLY BE SEEN AT STONITON THROUGH INQUIRY AT THE INN WHERE THE COACH PUT UP
AND THEN WHEN I HAD FURNISHED THEM WITH HALF A SOVEREIGN TO GET GLORIOUSLY DRUNK AFTER THEIR EXERTIONS I SHOULD HAVE PUT THE CLIMAX TO AS PRETTY A FARCE AS ANY OF MY BROTHER CLERGY HAVE SET GOING IN THEIR PARISHES FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IT IS REALLY INSOLENT OF THE MAN THOUGH TO CALL YOU AN IDLE SHEPHERD AND A DUMB DOG SAID MRS IRWINE
BUT I CAN GIVE IN TO NO MAN IF HE WANTS TO MAKE IT OUT AS I'M TRYING TO OVERREACH HIM
THERE'S A ROAD RIGHT THROUGH IT AND BITS OF OPENINGS HERE AND THERE WHERE THE TREES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN AND SOME OF EM NOT CARRIED AWAY
ALL HANDS WERE TO BE OUT IN THE MEADOWS THIS MORNING AS SOON AS THE DEW HAD RISEN
HE HAS THROWN OFF HIS PAPER CAP AND YOU SEE THAT HIS HAIR IS NOT THICK AND STRAIGHT LIKE ADAM'S BUT THIN AND WAVY ALLOWING YOU TO DISCERN THE EXACT CONTOUR OF A CORONAL ARCH THAT PREDOMINATES VERY DECIDEDLY OVER THE BROW
IN BED OUR YESTERDAYS ARE TOO OPPRESSIVE
AND IT'S THE LAST FETE-DAY I'M LIKELY TO SEE UNLESS YOU MAKE HASTE AND GET MARRIED ARTHUR
I DIDN'T KILL IT--I DIDN'T KILL IT MYSELF
IT IS NOW THE HALL FARM
AND AFTER EVER SUCH A WHILE--HOURS AND HOURS--THE MAN CAME--HIM IN A SMOCK-FROCK AND HE LOOKED AT ME SO I WAS FRIGHTENED AND I MADE HASTE AND WENT ON
PERHAPS DEATH WOULD COME TO HER FOR SHE WAS GETTING LESS AND LESS ABLE TO BEAR THE DAY'S WEARINESS
NO OTHER FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BESIDES MR GAWAINE WAS INVITED TO-DAY
HE COULD NOT TRUST HIS MOTHER'S INSIGHT
SHE'S ONE O THOSE WOMEN AS ARE BETTER THAN THEIR WORD WELL WELL SAID BARTLE I DON'T SAY TH APPLE ISN'T SOUND AT THE CORE
SHE LOOKED ROUND WITH BLANK EYES AT THE DIRT AND CONFUSION ON WHICH THE BRIGHT AFTERNOON'S SUN SHONE DISMALLY
HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE MUST BE A MISERABLE PRIG WHO WOULD ACT THE PEDAGOGUE HERE
THEN THERE WAS A LITTLE GREENFINCH JUST FLEDGED FLUTTERING ALONG THE GROUND AND IT SEEMED QUITE POSSIBLE TO CATCH IT TILL IT MANAGED TO FLUTTER UNDER THE BLACKBERRY BUSH
IT MADE HETTY QUITE SAD TO LOOK AT IT
IT'S WELL SEEN ON THEE WHAT IT IS NIVER TO BE UNAISY
HE WOULD NOT EXCHANGE THAT CAREER FOR ANY OTHER UNDER THE SUN
CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE AND PARSON IRWINE MEKS A FINE FUSS WI HIM
YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM
ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM
THERE WAS LIGHT ENOUGH FOR HER IF SHE OPENED HER BIBLE TO DISCERN THE TEXT SUFFICIENTLY TO KNOW WHAT IT WOULD SAY TO HER
BUT FOR THESE MOMENTS UNDER THE SUBDUING INFLUENCE OF DINAH'S SPIRIT SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST BE PATIENT AND STILL
THE ROOM IS A LARGE AND LOFTY ONE WITH AN AMPLE MULLIONED ORIEL WINDOW AT ONE END
TH HOSSES WOOANT FEEL YOUR WEIGHT NO MORE NOR THEY FEEL THE LITTLE DOOG THERE AS I PUCK UP ON THE ROAD A FORTNI'T AGOO
IF I DON'T GET YOUR PROMISE NOW I KNOW I SHALL HARDLY HAVE A CHANCE FOR ALL THE SMART YOUNG FARMERS WILL TAKE CARE TO SECURE YOU HETTY SMILED AND BLUSHED BUT BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER MRS POYSER INTERPOSED SCANDALIZED AT THE MERE SUGGESTION THAT THE YOUNG SQUIRE COULD BE EXCLUDED BY ANY MEANER PARTNERS
FOR IMAGINATION IS A LICENSED TRESPASSER
IT LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE INNOCENT DISTRESS THAN ILL HUMOUR
BUT ISN'T THE SUFFERING LESS HARD WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WITH YOU THAT FEELS FOR YOU--THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO AND SAY WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART?...YES HETTY
LET US GO INTO THE LIBRARY AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT WHILE MY GRANDFATHER IS IN THE DRAWING-ROOM WITH THE LADIES
THERE'S MESTER BURGE AS OWNS THE TIMBER-YARD OVER THERE HE UNDERTEKS A GOOD BIT O BUILDING AN REPAIRS
THAT'S PLAIN ENOUGH TO BE SEEN I DIDN'T MEAN AS I THOUGHT SO SAID THE HUSBAND APOLOGETICALLY BUT I SAID IT WAS WHAT THE JEWELLER MIGHT THINK AND SO HE WOULDN'T BE OFFERING MUCH MONEY FOR EM WELL SAID THE WIFE SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ADVANCE SOME MONEY ON THE THINGS YOURSELF AND THEN IF SHE LIKED TO REDEEM EM WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE COULD
THEM YOUNG FILLIES ULL RUN AWAY OFTEN WI'-OU KNOWING WHY HER UNCLE'S ANSWERS HOWEVER HAD HAD ANOTHER EFFECT ON HETTY BESIDES THAT OF DISAPPOINTING HER AND MAKING HER CRY
FOR YE'RE A STIRRIN BODY IN A MORNIN AN YE'VE A LIGHT HEEL AN YE'VE CLEANED TH HOUSE WELL ENOUGH FOR A MA'SHIFT MAKESHIFT MOTHER SAID ADAM
YES THE HOUSE MUST BE INHABITED AND WE WILL SEE BY WHOM
ENOUGH FOR ALL ENOUGH FOR EACH ENOUGH FOR EVERMORE
THIS WAS THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT FLASHED THROUGH ADAM'S CONSCIENCE BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO SEIZE THE COAT AND DRAG OUT THE TALL HEAVY BODY
ARE YOU QUITE SURE
BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS WOULD HA BEEN SORELY AGAINST IT SINCE THEY WON'T COME NIGH HER THEMSELVES
BUT THERE'S THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOVE AND SMALLPOX OR BEWITCHMENT EITHER--THAT IF YOU DETECT THE DISEASE AT AN EARLY STAGE AND TRY CHANGE OF AIR THERE IS EVERY CHANCE OF COMPLETE ESCAPE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF SYMPTOMS
SO THEY WALKED APART THOUGH SIDE BY SIDE AND THE CLOSE POKE OF HER LITTLE BLACK BONNET HID HER FACE FROM HIM
BUT I'VE THAT OPINION OF YOU THAT YOU'LL RISE ABOVE IT ALL AND BE A MAN AGAIN AND THERE MAY GOOD COME OUT OF THIS THAT WE DON'T SEE GOOD COME OUT OF IT SAID ADAM PASSIONATELY
IF HE LUNCHED WITH GAWAINE AND LINGERED CHATTING HE SHOULD NOT REACH THE CHASE AGAIN TILL NEARLY FIVE WHEN HETTY WOULD BE SAFE OUT OF HIS SIGHT IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM
AND CLOSE TO JUNO'S TAIL WHICH WAS WAGGING WITH CALM MATRONLY PLEASURE THE TWO BROWN PUPS WERE ROLLING OVER EACH OTHER IN AN ECSTATIC DUET OF WORRYING NOISES
AN THEM FRENCH ARE A WICKED SORT O FOLKS BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT
HE KNEW ARTHUR WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT ADAM HAD THIS SORT OF HAPPINESS IN PROSPECT
HE WAS EVEN RATHER TREMULOUS AS HE BRUSHED HIS HAIR--POOH
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE HE'D MUCH BETTER HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF MANURES
AN SO WAR ADAM BUT THEY'N NE'ER COMED AGAIN THIS EAR
THE HUMAN SOUL IS A VERY COMPLEX THING
BUT WE MUST SPARE HER IT SEEMS AND NOT FOR A HUSBAND NEITHER BUT FOR HER OWN MEGRIMS
AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE VILLAGE THE PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING HIM FOR HE'D APPOINTED THE TIME AND THE PLACE WHEN HE WAS THERE BEFORE AND SUCH OF THEM AS CARED TO HEAR THE WORD OF LIFE WERE ASSEMBLED ON A SPOT WHERE THE COTTAGES WAS THICKEST SO AS OTHERS MIGHT BE DRAWN TO COME
I THINK SHE HAD NO FEELING AT ALL TOWARDS THE OLD HOUSE AND DID NOT LIKE THE JACOB'S LADDER AND THE LONG ROW OF HOLLYHOCKS IN THE GARDEN BETTER THAN OTHER FLOWERS--PERHAPS NOT SO WELL
HAVE A LITTLE MORE MR BEDE SAID MRS POYSER AS ADAM SET DOWN THE BASIN
SHE HAD A GREAT GIFT AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS NOW LIVING WHO ARE PRECIOUS FELLOW-HELPERS IN THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY
MR ROE THE TRAVELLING PREACHER STATIONED AT TREDDLESTON HAD INCLUDED MR IRWINE IN A GENERAL STATEMENT CONCERNING THE CHURCH CLERGY IN THE SURROUNDING DISTRICT WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS MEN GIVEN UP TO THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH AND THE PRIDE OF LIFE
BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE SAID MRS POYSER WHO WAS REMARKABLE FOR THE FACILITY WITH WHICH SHE COULD RELAPSE FROM HER OFFICIAL OBJURGATORY TO ONE OF FONDNESS OR OF FRIENDLY CONVERSE
A MONTH AGO PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HAVE MAINTAINED A SUITABLE SADNESS IN THEIR FACES WHEN MR ARTHUR WAS COME TO TAKE POSSESSION
ONE THING IS CLEAR
I HAD TO GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COPPICE TO LOOK AFTER SOME STAKES
HETTY THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE DAY SHE HAD HAD FOR A LONG WHILE A MOMENT OF CHILL DAYLIGHT AND REALITY CAME ACROSS HER DREAM
HE WAS NOT SURE ABOUT DINAH'S FEELING AND HE THOUGHT HE WAS SURE ABOUT ADAM'S
WHAT DOST SAY
IT HAD A FAINT SCENT OF ROSES WHICH MADE HER FEEL AS IF ARTHUR WERE CLOSE TO HER
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ENTRANCE-HALLS WHICH MAKE THE SURROUNDING ROOMS LOOK LIKE CLOSETS--WITH STUCCO ANGELS TRUMPETS AND FLOWER-WREATHS ON THE LOFTY CEILING AND GREAT MEDALLIONS OF MISCELLANEOUS HEROES ON THE WALLS ALTERNATING WITH STATUES IN NICHES
CARROLL WE SHALL WANT MORE COFFEE AND EGGS AND HAVEN'T YOU GOT SOME COLD FOWL FOR US TO EAT WITH THAT HAM
HER HEART BEAT NO FASTER AND SHE LOOKED AT THE HALF-BARE HEDGEROWS AND THE PLOUGHED FIELD WITH THE SAME SENSE OF OPPRESSIVE DULNESS AS BEFORE
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH O THAT I WAS GOING TO THE HERMITAGE SAID ARTHUR
THEE MUST TRY AND MAKE UP THY MIND TO DO WITHOUT HER NAY BUT I CANNA MA UP MY MIND WHEN SHE'S JUST CUT OUT FOR THEE
SHE HAD BLUSHED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND THEN THERE WAS THAT TOUCH OF SADNESS ABOUT HER WHICH MUST SURELY MEAN LOVE SINCE IT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF HER USUAL MANNER WHICH HAD OFTEN IMPRESSED HIM AS INDIFFERENCE
HE RUBBED HIS HAIR OFF HIS FOREHEAD AND LISTENED
AND YET EVEN IN HER MOST SELF-CONSCIOUS MOMENTS THE FACE WAS SADLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH HAD SMILED AT ITSELF IN THE OLD SPECKED GLASS OR SMILED AT OTHERS WHEN THEY GLANCED AT IT ADMIRINGLY
LEAST SAID SOONEST MENDED
I CAN'T HELP THINKING AS YOU'VE BEEN TRUSTING TO HIS LOVING YOU WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY YOU FOR ALL HE'S A GENTLEMAN
THEY CAN SEE THROUGH A BARN-DOOR THEY CAN
BUT WE BEGAN WITH CALLING HER LOTTY AND NOW IT'S GOT TO TOTTY
A MELANCHOLY MORNING--BECAUSE IT WAS NEARLY TIME HAY-HARVEST SHOULD BEGIN AND INSTEAD OF THAT THE MEADOWS WERE LIKELY TO BE FLOODED
MARTIN HAD NEVER HEARD TELL OF THE FRENCH BEING GOOD FOR MUCH
THE MORE KNOWLEDGE A MAN HAS THE BETTER HE'LL DO'S WORK
IT ISNA BY MY WISH AS THEE HAST A STROKE O WORK TO DO
IF HE COULD HAVE SEEN HER AGAIN
THE CAPTAIN UD GET THERE IN NINE OR TEN HOURS I'LL BE BOUND HE'S SUCH A RIDER
CAN GOD TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF US POOR PEOPLE
SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM NOW QUITE EARNESTLY ALMOST WITH THE TEARS COMING AND SAID OH NO ADAM
THOU HAST ENTERED THAT BLACK DARKNESS WHERE GOD IS NOT AND HAST UTTERED THE CRY OF THE FORSAKEN
HE WAS A VERY OLD MAN AND HAD VERY LONG WHITE HAIR
THEE MIGHT'ST DO AS I SHOULD HA SOMEBODY WI ME TO COMFORT ME A BIT AN WAIT ON ME WHEN I'M BAD AN BE GOOD TO ME WELL MOTHER WHOSE FAULT IS IT THERE ISNA SOME TIDY BODY I TH HOUSE T HELP THEE
HE CAN'T ABIDE TO THINK I LOVE THEE THE BEST LISBETH SAID NOTHING BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SAY SO MANY THINGS
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING O THAT SORT TO THEE MOTHER HE SAID IN A LOWER TONE
I DIDN'T LIKE TO SET THE CONSTABLE AFTER HER FOR SHE'D A RIGHT TO GO FROM ME IF SHE LIKED THE EFFECT OF THIS EVIDENCE ON ADAM WAS ELECTRICAL
WELL MRS POYSER HOW ARE YOU AFTER THIS STORMY MORNING SAID MR IRWINE WITH HIS STATELY CORDIALITY
I FRIGHTENED YOU HE SAID WITH A DELICIOUS SENSE THAT IT DIDN'T SIGNIFY WHAT HE SAID SINCE HETTY SEEMED TO FEEL AS MUCH AS HE DID
ADAM LOOKED DOWN AT HER BUT HER EYES WERE TURNED DREAMILY TOWARDS ANOTHER CORNER OF THE GARDEN
THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER STRIKING ABOUT HER THOUGH
THEREFORE LET US ALWAYS HAVE MEN READY TO GIVE THE LOVING PAINS OF A LIFE TO THE FAITHFUL REPRESENTING OF COMMONPLACE THINGS--MEN WHO SEE BEAUTY IN THESE COMMONPLACE THINGS AND DELIGHT IN SHOWING HOW KINDLY THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN FALLS ON THEM
THERE WAS NOT MUCH ROOM FOR HER THOUGHTS TO TRAVEL IN THE NARROW CIRCLE OF HER IMAGINATION AND SHE SOON FIXED ON THE ONE THING SHE WOULD DO TO GET AWAY FROM HER OLD LIFE
SPOKEN WELL OF ON MARKET-DAYS AS A FIRST-RATE LANDLORD
I'VE WISHED AGAIN AND AGAIN I'D BEEN A BLOODY MINDED MAN THAT I COULD HAVE STRANGLED THE MOTHER AND THE BRATS WITH ONE CORD I'M GLAD IT WAS NO WORSE A CAUSE KEPT YOU FROM CHURCH SAID ADAM
NEITHER ARE PICTURESQUE LAZZARONI OR ROMANTIC CRIMINALS HALF SO FREQUENT AS YOUR COMMON LABOURER WHO GETS HIS OWN BREAD AND EATS IT VULGARLY BUT CREDITABLY WITH HIS OWN POCKET-KNIFE
AND BESIDES THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO SUFFER IN YOUR FEELINGS WI GIVING YOUR LOVE TO A MAN AS CAN NEVER MARRY YOU SO AS HE MIGHT TAKE CARE OF YOU ALL YOUR LIFE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT-TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND
THUS THERE WAS BOTH RESPECT AND AFFECTION IN THE SMILE WITH WHICH HE RAISED HIS PAPER CAP AS ARTHUR DONNITHORNE RODE UP
SMILE AT ME AND TELL ME WHAT'S THE MATTER
HIS BLOOD WAS AS THOROUGHLY UP AS ADAM'S NOW AND THE TWO MEN FORGETTING THE EMOTIONS THAT HAD GONE BEFORE FOUGHT WITH THE INSTINCTIVE FIERCENESS OF PANTHERS IN THE DEEPENING TWILIGHT DARKENED BY THE TREES
AND I DESIRE FOR YOU THAT WHILE YOU ARE YOUNG YOU SHOULD SEEK FOR STRENGTH FROM YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER THAT YOU MAY HAVE A SUPPORT WHICH WILL NOT FAIL YOU IN THE EVIL DAY DINAH PAUSED AND RELEASED HETTY'S HANDS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT HINDER HER
TO SAY NOTHING OF JOSHUA RANN'S FIDDLE WHICH BY AN ACT OF GENEROUS FORETHOUGHT HE HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH IN CASE ANY ONE SHOULD BE OF SUFFICIENTLY PURE TASTE TO PREFER DANCING TO A SOLO ON THAT INSTRUMENT
HOW THEN COULD SHE FIND A SHAPE FOR HER EXPECTATIONS
SO I WAS FOR GIVING IT UP AND I WENT ON ABOUT MY BUSINESS
ONLY SHE HAD TOLD CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE THAT SHE USUALLY SET OUT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND IF HE SHOULD GO TO THE GROVE AGAIN EXPECTING TO SEE HER AND SHE SHOULD BE GONE
THE LEAVES STILL GREEN WERE TOSSED OFF THE HEDGEROW TREES BY THE WIND
SHE WAS WEARY HUNGRY
BUT SHE'S A STRANGE WAY OF NOT LIKING YOUNG WOMEN
ADAM WAS LOOKING ON THE GROUND AND PAUSED A LITTLE
IT SUBSIDED WHEN HE SAW ADAM HOLDING UP HIS FINGER AT HIM TO IMPOSE SILENCE AND IN HIS DUMB TAILLESS JOY HE MUST CONTENT HIMSELF WITH RUBBING HIS BODY AGAINST HIS MASTER'S LEGS
BUT HE'S BEEN SO SORE AN ANGERED HE WOULDN'T ATE EM FOR ALL I'D PUTTEN EM BY O PURPOSE FOR HIM
THEE MUST GO THYSEN SIN ADAM WONNA LET ME GO TO HIM
YOU THINK OF EAR-RINGS AND FINE GOWNS AND CAPS AND YOU NEVER THINK OF THE SAVIOUR WHO DIED TO SAVE YOUR PRECIOUS SOUL
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SET THE WASPS TO GETHER THE FRUIT ADAM LONGED TO SAY HE WOULD GO INTO THE GARDEN TILL MR POYSER CAME IN BUT HE WAS NOT QUITE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH SO HE SAID I COULD BE LOOKING AT YOUR SPINNING-WHEEL THEN AND SEE WHAT WANTS DOING TO IT
HE WAS PRESSED TO COME AGAIN SOON BUT NOT TO STAY LONGER FOR AT THIS BUSY TIME SENSIBLE PEOPLE WOULD NOT RUN THE RISK OF BEING SLEEPY AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
FOR IT WAS HIS ONE EXTRAVAGANCE IN THESE DEAR TIMES TO EAT BREAD ONCE A-DAY INSTEAD OF OAT-CAKE
BEFORE IT DREW UP ON THE GRAVEL OF THE COURTYARD ALL THE SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE WERE ASSEMBLED TO RECEIVE HIM WITH A GRAVE DECENT WELCOME BEFITTING A HOUSE OF DEATH
YOU'RE SO YOUNG YOU KNOW HETTY HE WENT ON ALMOST TENDERLY AND Y HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH O WHAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD
BUT IT WAS AN UNKNOWN FACE BELONGING TO AN ELDERLY MAN IN A SMOCK-FROCK
IT IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED THAT ANY BUT THE DULLEST BRITONS CAN BE GOOD SUBJECTS UNDER THAT HARD CONDITION
TO ANY LISTENER OUTSIDE THE DOOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE REVERSE OF OBVIOUS WHY THE DRINK BOYS DRINK SHOULD HAVE SUCH AN IMMEDIATE AND OFTEN-REPEATED ENCORE
HE WAS AS STRONGLY IMPELLED TO LOOK PAINFUL FACTS RIGHT IN THE FACE AS ARTHUR WAS TO TURN AWAY HIS EYES FROM THEM
AND THERE WAS HETTY LIKE A BRIGHT-CHEEKED APPLE HANGING OVER THE ORCHARD WALL WITHIN SIGHT OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST LONG FOR HER
BUT I COULD BE BACK IN THREE DAYS IF THEE COULDST SPARE ME NAY NAY I CANNA SPARE THEE
AND LAST WEDNESDAY WHEN I CALLED AT THE POST AT TREDDLES'ON I FOUND A LETTER FROM HER
WITH THAT THOUGHT AND BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO REMEMBER ANY REASONS WHY IT COULD NOT BE TRUE CAME A NEW SENSE OF FORSAKENNESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT
AN SHE'S LAID HOLD OF CHAD'S BESS AS THE GIRL'S BEEN I FITS WELLY IVER SIN WELL BESSY CRANAGE IS A HEARTY-LOOKING LASS
I'M AS WISHFUL T HAVE YOU SETTLED WELL AS IF YOU WAS MY OWN DAUGHTER
I THINK MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THE PROMISE IS SWEETER WHEN THIS LIFE IS SO DARK AND WEARY AND THE SOUL GETS MORE HUNGRY WHEN THE BODY IS ILL AT EASE WHY YES OUR FARM-LABOURERS ARE NOT EASILY ROUSED
INDEED IT IS ON THE GROUND OF THAT EXPECTATION THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAS WISHED ME TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY AND TO COME AMONG YOU NOW
SHE IS AN ANXIOUS SPARE YET VIGOROUS OLD WOMAN CLEAN AS A SNOWDROP
SETH MIGHT GAIN MORE BY WORKING AT SEPARATE JOBS UNDER ADAM'S DIRECTION THAN BY HIS JOURNEYMAN'S WORK AND ADAM IN HIS OVERHOURS COULD DO ALL THE NICE WORK THAT REQUIRED PECULIAR SKILL
HE BORE THE SAME SORT OF RESEMBLANCE TO HIS MOTHER THAT OUR LOVING MEMORY OF A FRIEND'S FACE OFTEN BEARS TO THE FACE ITSELF
THE GENTRY'S HARD WORK TO HUNDERSTAND EM
WHO'D MAKE IT SO WELL
BUT HETTY HAD NEVER GIVEN ADAM ANY STEADY ENCOURAGEMENT
THAT AFTERGLOW HAS LONG FADED AWAY
SHE WOULD ASK HER UNCLE TO LET HER GO TO BE A LADY'S MAID
I'LL BE AN OLD BACHELOR BELIKE AND MAKE A FUSS WI THY CHILDREN THE'Y TURNED AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AND SETH WALKED LEISURELY HOMEWARD MENTALLY REPEATING ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE HYMNS--HE WAS VERY FOND OF HYMNS
BUT HE MEANT TO MAKE LEISURE FOR GOING TO THE FARM TO-MORROW
ARTHUR CANTERED FOR FIVE MILES BEYOND THE CHASE TILL HE WAS AT THE FOOT OF A HILL WHERE THERE WERE NO HEDGES OR TREES TO HEM IN THE ROAD
THE GARDEN WAS SO LARGE
WHY WHAT'S THAT STICKING AGAINST THE WILLOW CONTINUED SETH BEGINNING TO WALK FASTER
AND I SAID I'LL LAY MY LIFE IT'S THAT YOUNG WOMAN'S CHILD AS I MET GOING TO THE COPPICE BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE GONE CLEAN OUT OF SIGHT

THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE WONNA LIKE--SUCH WAYS AS I'VE HEARD OF
WHY THAT PICTUR WAS MADE AFORE CHRISTMAS AND YIT IT'S COME AS TRUE AS TH BIBLE
SHE USED TO HEAR IT IN A TIME WHEN SHE HAD ONLY TRIFLES TO HIDE
ARTHUR HIMSELF HAD PROVIDED THE PRIZES FOR THE MEN AND BILL WAS MADE HAPPY WITH A SPLENDID POCKET-KNIFE SUPPLIED WITH BLADES AND GIMLETS ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN AT HOME ON A DESERT ISLAND
NO ADAM SAID TO HIMSELF TO-NIGHT THAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
I'D MAKE IT CONVENIENT FOR THEE TO BE AWAY THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND IT UD BE NO WALK FOR THEE--ONLY BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY MILE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AGAIN WHETHER OR NO IF SHE WOULDNA BE DISPLEASED WITH ME FOR GOING SAID SETH
FOR WHAT WOMAN WAS EVER SATISFIED WITH APPARENT NEGLECT EVEN WHEN SHE KNOWS IT TO BE THE MASK OF LOVE
WHAT IS THERE TO LAUGH AT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IT'S ON'Y TRADESFOLKS AS TURN METHODISTS
WHY IT'S GOING ON FOR HALF-PAST NINE AND I'VE SENT THE GELLS TO BED THIS HALF-HOUR AND LATE ENOUGH TOO
AND IT GOT LIGHTER FOR THERE CAME THE MOON--OH DINAH IT FRIGHTENED ME WHEN IT FIRST LOOKED AT ME OUT O THE CLOUDS--IT NEVER LOOKED SO BEFORE
FOR I CANNOT PRETEND THAT SETH AND DINAH WERE ANYTHING ELSE THAN METHODISTS--NOT INDEED OF THAT MODERN TYPE WHICH READS QUARTERLY REVIEWS AND ATTENDS IN CHAPELS WITH PILLARED PORTICOES BUT OF A VERY OLD-FASHIONED KIND
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT THAT YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU WILL KNOW BY AND BY MOTHER
THERE IS BUT ONE THING LEFT TO HER
I SHOULD HAVE RIDDEN OVER TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT ONLY I WAS SO BUSY
AND IT'S RIGHT WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT THIS EVENING WAS THE LAST HE WOULD ALLOW TO BE ABSORBED BY SORROW
EVERY PRETTY GIRL IS NOT SUCH A FOOL AS YOU TO SUPPOSE THAT WHEN A GENTLEMAN ADMIRES HER BEAUTY AND PAYS HER A LITTLE ATTENTION HE MUST MEAN SOMETHING PARTICULAR
AND AS ADAM PICKED IT UP HE SAW THE GLASS WITH THE DARK AND LIGHT LOCKS OF HAIR UNDER IT
IT'S A BLEAK AND BARREN COUNTRY THERE NOT LIKE THIS LAND OF GOSHEN YOU'VE BEEN USED TO
IT SEEMED LIKE AS IF I SHOULD STAY THERE FOR EVER AND NOTHING UD EVER CHANGE
SHE WAS NOT THINKING OF HER NECK AND ARMS NOW
AND HIS AUNT SHOULD BE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE AND GO ON LIVING AT THE CHASE IF SHE LIKED IN SPITE OF HER OLD-MAIDISH WAYS--AT LEAST UNTIL HE WAS MARRIED AND THAT EVENT LAY IN THE INDISTINCT BACKGROUND FOR ARTHUR HAD NOT YET SEEN THE WOMAN WHO WOULD PLAY THE LADY-WIFE TO THE FIRST-RATE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN
IN THAT SHORT SPACE HE WAS LIVING THROUGH ALL HIS LOVE AGAIN
I THINK THEE'DST PERHAPS LIKE TO READ IT BUT I DIDNA SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEE'ST SEEMED SO FULL OF OTHER THINGS
MY HEAD'S NONE SO HOLLOW AS IT MUST GET IN AN NOUGHT TO PUT IT THERE
AND IT'S MY BESETMENT TO FORGET WHERE I AM AND EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND LOSE MYSELF IN THOUGHTS THAT I COULD GIVE NO ACCOUNT OF FOR I COULD NEITHER MAKE A BEGINNING NOR ENDING OF THEM IN WORDS
I'M NONE SO FOND O JOSH TOD'S THICK ALE BUT I DON'T HINDER YOU FROM MAKING A FOOL O YOURSELF WI'T THERE WAS A LAUGH AT THIS THRUST OF ADAM'S BUT SETH SAID VERY SERIOUSLY
THE ACTION WHICH BEFORE COMMISSION HAS BEEN SEEN WITH THAT BLENDED COMMON SENSE AND FRESH UNTARNISHED FEELING WHICH IS THE HEALTHY EYE OF THE SOUL IS LOOKED AT AFTERWARDS WITH THE LENS OF APOLOGETIC INGENUITY THROUGH WHICH ALL THINGS THAT MEN CALL BEAUTIFUL AND UGLY ARE SEEN TO BE MADE UP OF TEXTURES VERY MUCH ALIKE
YOU THINK YOU'LL BE FINELY OFF WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED I DARESAY AND HAVE GOT A THREE-LEGGED STOOL TO SIT ON AND NEVER A BLANKET TO COVER YOU AND A BIT O OAT-CAKE FOR YOUR DINNER AS THREE CHILDREN ARE A-SNATCHING AT I'M SURE I DONNA WANT T GO WI THE WHITTAWS SAID MOLLY WHIMPERING AND QUITE OVERCOME BY THIS DANTEAN PICTURE OF HER FUTURE ON'Y WE ALLAYS USED TO COMB THE WOOL FOR N AT MESTER OTTLEY'S
WHAT ARE YOU SO DISMAL ABOUT DAUPHIN
IT WAS NOW AS IT HAD BEEN EIGHT MONTHS AGO--ADAM WAS FORCING ARTHUR TO FEEL MORE INTENSELY THE IRREVOCABLENESS OF HIS OWN WRONG-DOING
HIS FACE UNWASHED SINCE YESTERDAY LOOKED PALLID AND CLAMMY
BLESS YOUR SWEET FACE MY PET SHE SAID THE MOTHER'S STRONG LOVE FILLING HER KEEN EYES WITH MILDNESS AS TOTTY LEANED FORWARD AND PUT OUT HER ARMS
I BELIEVE AFTER ALL HE GOT IT CHIEFLY FROM NATURE WHO HAD POURED SOME OF HER MUSIC INTO THIS HONEST CONCEITED SOUL AS SHE HAD BEEN KNOWN TO DO INTO OTHER NARROW SOULS BEFORE HIS
THE CAPTAIN'S SENT ME ORDERS AH SAID BARTLE PAUSING WITH ONE HAND ON HIS BACK
NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN
BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER CAUGHT HIS IMAGINATION LEAPING FORWARD IN THIS WAY--MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE--THAN HE CHECKED HIMSELF
IT'S REALLY AN UNCONSCIONABLE AGE
SHE WAS TOO WISE TO PERSIST AND ONLY SAID MILDLY YES MY DEAR YOU'RE TIRED
SHE ONLY INVITED HER TO SIT DOWN TO BREAKFAST WITH THEM AND IN THE COURSE OF IT HETTY BROUGHT OUT HER EAR-RINGS AND LOCKET AND ASKED THE LANDLORD IF HE COULD HELP HER TO GET MONEY FOR THEM
AND THERE'S THEM AS UD BE BETTER IF THEY COULD MAKE THEIRSELVES LIKE HER I MORE WAYS NOR PUTTING ON HER CAP
THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT WOULD COME SINCE THIS STRANGE ENTRANCING DELIGHT HAD COME
I'M OFF HOME
BUT THERE'S SETH BEDE
I KNOW YOU'RE FOND O WHEY AS MOST FOLKS IS WHEN THEY HANNA GOT TO CRUSH IT OUT THANK YOU MRS POYSER SAID ADAM
I'LL TAKE A BIT OF A ROOM HERE WHERE I CAN SEE THE PRISON WALLS AND PERHAPS I SHALL GET IN TIME TO BEAR SEEING HER ADAM HAD NOT BEEN SHAKEN IN HIS BELIEF THAT HETTY WAS INNOCENT OF THE CRIME SHE WAS CHARGED WITH FOR MR IRWINE FEELING THAT THE BELIEF IN HER GUILT WOULD BE A CRUSHING ADDITION TO ADAM'S LOAD HAD KEPT FROM HIM THE FACTS WHICH LEFT NO HOPE IN HIS OWN MIND
THE VERY GRINDSTONE ULL GO ON TURNING A BIT AFTER YOU LOOSE IT BODDERATION ADAM EXCLAIMED WIRY BEN
AS THEY APPROACHED THE COTTAGE IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD DO WELL TO LEARN FROM THE OLD WOMAN WHERE DINAH WAS TO BE FOUND IN LEEDS
QUIET VIXEN SNARLED BARTLE TURNING ROUND UPON HER
AND YOU AS HAVE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE LAST MICHAELMAS AND I HIRED YOU AT TREDDLES'ON STATTITS WITHOUT A BIT O CHARACTER--AS I SAY YOU MIGHT BE GRATEFUL TO BE HIRED IN THAT WAY TO A RESPECTABLE PLACE
EVEN THEN SHE WAS AS READY TO BE STARTLED AS THE DEER THAT LEAPED AWAY AT HER APPROACH
CLOSE YOUR EYES HETTY DINAH SAID AND LET US PRAY WITHOUT CEASING TO GOD AND IN A LOW VOICE AS THE CART WENT SLOWLY ALONG THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE GAZING CROWD SHE POURED FORTH HER SOUL WITH THE WRESTLING INTENSITY OF A LAST PLEADING FOR THE TREMBLING CREATURE THAT CLUNG TO HER AND CLUTCHED HER AS THE ONLY VISIBLE SIGN OF LOVE AND PITY
BUT AFTER A FEW STEPS HE STOOD STILL AGAIN AND SAID COLDLY I BELIEVE I MUST TROUBLE YOU
AND FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AT LEAST HETTY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF HEARING HER UNCLE SAY ADAM BEDE MAY BE WORKING FOR WAGE NOW BUT HE'LL BE A MASTER-MAN SOME DAY AS SURE AS I SIT IN THIS CHAIR
YES SAID MRS POYSER RETURNING FROM A PARENTHETIC GLANCE AT THE COWS THAT'S ALLAYS THE REASON I'M TO SIT DOWN WI WHEN YOU'VE A MIND TO DO ANYTHING CONTRAIRY
I SHAN'T BE HOME BEFORE GOING FOR TEN
TROUBLE DOESNA MAKE ME CARE THE LESS FOR THEE
NOT AS I WISH TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFUL O THEM AS HAVE GOT THE POWER I THEIR HANDS BUT IT'S MORE THAN FLESH AND BLOOD ULL BEAR SOMETIMES TO BE TOILING AND STRIVING AND UP EARLY AND DOWN LATE AND HARDLY SLEEPING A WINK WHEN YOU LIE DOWN FOR THINKING AS THE CHEESE MAY SWELL OR THE COWS MAY SLIP THEIR CALF OR THE WHEAT MAY GROW GREEN AGAIN I THE SHEAF--AND AFTER ALL AT TH END O THE YEAR IT'S LIKE AS IF YOU'D BEEN COOKING A FEAST AND HAD GOT THE SMELL OF IT FOR YOUR PAINS MRS POYSER ONCE LAUNCHED INTO CONVERSATION ALWAYS SAILED ALONG WITHOUT ANY CHECK FROM HER PRELIMINARY AWE OF THE GENTRY
ARTHUR TOO WAS VERY UNEASY BUT HIS FEELINGS WERE LIT UP FOR HIM BY A MORE DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS
SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD BE FILLED UP WITH HER OWN LIFE THEN AND SHE'S BEEN USED SO TO LIVING IN OTHER FOLKS'S CARES SHE CAN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HER HEART BEING SHUT UP FROM EM
HETTY MADE AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT TOWARDS HIM SOME OF THE LOVE THAT SHE HAD ONCE LIVED IN THE MIDST OF WAS COME NEAR HER AGAIN
SHE'S PRETTY NEAR AS OLD AS THEE
WHY IT UD ASTONISH A FRENCHMAN ONLY TO LOOK AT HIM
HETTY SAT QUITE STILL
IT WILL HARDLY DO FOR ME TO PATRONIZE A METHODIST PREACHER EVEN IF SHE WOULD CONSENT TO BE PATRONIZED BY AN IDLE SHEPHERD AS WILL MASKERY CALLS ME
IT'S JUST AS IF THEY WORE BLINKERS LIKE TH HORSES AND COULD SEE NOTHING O ONE SIDE OF EM
THERE'S ADAM ALONG WI DINAH SAID MR POYSER AS HE OPENED THE FAR GATE INTO THE HOME CLOSE
AN ME AS THOUGHT HIM SUCH A GOOD UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN AS I SHOULD BE GLAD WHEN HE COME TO BE OUR LANDLORD
AN SETH BEDE'S BEEN TO ME THIS MORNING TO SAY HE WISHED ME TO TELL YOUR REVERENCE AS HIS BROTHER ADAM BEGGED OF YOU PARTICULAR T ALLOW HIS FATHER'S GRAVE TO BE DUG BY THE WHITE THORN BECAUSE HIS MOTHER'S SET HER HEART ON IT ON ACCOUNT OF A DREAM AS SHE HAD
ONLY HE PUT HIS THOUGHTS INTO DIFFERENT WORDS
AND AS FOR CLEANLINESS MY HOUSE IS CLEANER THAN ANY OTHER HOUSE ON THE COMMON THOUGH THE HALF OF EM SWARM WITH WOMEN
HAD BEEN MOMENTARILY DRAWN TOWARDS THE MAN WHO OFFERED HER A PROTECTING FAITHFUL LOVE
BUT WHAT COULD A MAN DO IN SUCH A DILEMMA
THEIR CLEVERNESS LL NEVER COME TO MUCH--NEVER COME TO MUCH--BUT THEY MAKE EXCELLENT SIMPLETONS RIPE AND STRONG-FLAVOURED WHAT DOST SAY TO THAT SAID MR POYSER THROWING HIMSELF BACK AND LOOKING MERRILY AT HIS WIFE
BUT SHE'S YOUNG AN GETS THINGS IN HER HEAD AS SHE CAN'T RIGHTLY GIVE ACCOUNT ON
HERE'S TO YOUR HEALTH AND MAY YOU ALLAYS HAVE STRENGTH TO LOOK AFTER YOUR OWN DAIRY AND SET A PATTERN T ALL THE FARMERS WIVES IN THE COUNTRY MRS POYSER WAS NOT TO BE CAUGHT IN THE WEAKNESS OF SMILING AT A COMPLIMENT BUT A QUIET COMPLACENCY OVER-SPREAD HER FACE LIKE A STEALING SUNBEAM AND GAVE A MILDER GLANCE THAN USUAL TO HER BLUE-GREY EYES AS SHE LOOKED AT ADAM DRINKING THE WHEY
THINK WHAT IT IS--NOT TO HATE ANYTHING BUT SIN
I CAN ONLY CLASP HER IN MY WEAK ARMS AND URGE HER WITH MY WEAK PITY
SHE OVERWORKS HERSELF AND I CAN'T PERSUADE HER TO HAVE A LITTLE GIRL T HELP HER
I TELL IT AS HE TOLD IT NOT ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE IT TO ITS NATURAL ELEMENTS--IN OUR EAGERNESS TO EXPLAIN IMPRESSIONS WE OFTEN LOSE OUR HOLD OF THE SYMPATHY THAT COMPREHENDS THEM
BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES SOMETHING UNWONTED MUST CLEARLY BE IN THE WIND FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE
SHE HAD BROUGHT OUT HER LITTLE STORE OF BLEACHED LINEN WHICH SHE HAD FOR LONG YEARS KEPT IN RESERVE FOR THIS SUPREME USE
I'VE NOTICED IT OFTEN AMONG MY OWN PEOPLE ROUND SNOWFIELD THAT THE STRONG SKILFUL MEN ARE OFTEN THE GENTLEST TO THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BUT THIS FRAIL FENCE OF VAGUE IMPROBABILITIES WAS SOON HURLED DOWN BY A RUSH OF DISTINCT AGONIZING FEARS
THE LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO ADAM BUT HE WENT OUT OF DOORS AGAIN BEFORE OPENING IT
I HAVE HAD NEWS OF HETTY THIS MORNING
DINAH SAW THE EFFECT AND HER TENDER ANXIOUS PLEADING BECAME THE MORE EARNEST TILL HETTY FULL OF A VAGUE FEAR THAT SOMETHING EVIL WAS SOME TIME TO BEFALL HER BEGAN TO CRY
TO BE SURE IF SHE LOVED HIM VERY MUCH SHE WOULD BE CONTENT TO WAIT FOR HIM
WHY SHOULD YOU THINK THEY'LL COME AGAIN
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S MORE TEXTS FOR YOUR MARRYING THAN EVER YOU CAN FIND AGAINST IT
BUT NOW I'M GOING A LONG JOURNEY TO LOOK FOR HER AND I CAN'T TRUST T ANYBODY BUT YOU WHERE I'M GOING MR IRWINE CAME BACK FROM THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN
HE CARRIES WITHIN HIM THE GERM OF HIS MOST EXCEPTIONAL ACTION
GOOD-BYE ADAM
ADAM COULD NOT HELP HOPING THIS AND AS HE RECOGNIZED THE COTTAGE BY THE ROADSIDE BEFORE HIM THERE SHONE OUT IN HIS FACE THAT INVOLUNTARY SMILE WHICH BELONGS TO THE EXPECTATION OF A NEAR JOY
I'LL NEVER COUNT YOU MY FRIEND ANY MORE
THE PUNISHMENT WILL SURELY FALL WITHOUT YOUR AID
ALL MY PEACE AND MY JOY HAVE COME FROM HAVING NO LIFE OF MY OWN NO WANTS NO WISHES FOR MYSELF AND LIVING ONLY IN GOD AND THOSE OF HIS CREATURES WHOSE SORROWS AND JOYS HE HAS GIVEN ME TO KNOW
AND MR IRWINE CAME LAST WITH HIS PALE SISTER ANNE
IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS TO BE PRYING AND ANALYTIC IN SUCH CASES AS IF ONE WERE INQUIRING INTO THE CHARACTER OF A CONFIDENTIAL CLERK
THANK GOD
THAT STALWART ROGUE ADAM WAS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN THE RECTOR HAD THOUGHT
FOR THE HEDGEROWS IN THOSE DAYS SHUT OUT ONE'S VIEW EVEN ON THE BETTER-MANAGED FARMS
SON-IN-LAW OR NO SON-IN-LAW ADAM HAD MADE HIMSELF TOO NECESSARY TO BE PARTED WITH AND HIS HEADWORK WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO BURGE THAN HIS SKILL IN HANDICRAFT THAT HIS HAVING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUE OF HIS SERVICES
BUT THAT WAS NOT THE RIGHT WORD FOR ITS MIXTURE OF BONHOMIE AND DISTINCTION
YOUNG SOULS IN SUCH PLEASANT DELIRIUM AS HERS ARE AS UNSYMPATHETIC AS BUTTERFLIES SIPPING NECTAR
IT UD BE A PITY TO LET IT FADE HETTY TOOK THE ROSE SMILING AS SHE DID SO AT THE PLEASANT THOUGHT THAT ARTHUR COULD SO SOON GET BACK IF HE LIKED
AND YET ITS CRYING WENT THROUGH ME AND I DAREDN'T LOOK AT ITS LITTLE HANDS AND FACE
LET US FALL ON OUR KNEES AGAIN AND PRAY TO THE GOD OF ALL MERCY CHAPTER XLVI THE HOURS OF SUSPENSE ON SUNDAY MORNING WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS IN STONITON WERE RINGING FOR MORNING SERVICE BARTLE MASSEY RE-ENTERED ADAM'S ROOM AFTER A SHORT ABSENCE AND SAID ADAM HERE'S A VISITOR WANTS TO SEE YOU ADAM WAS SEATED WITH IS BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HE STARTED UP AND TURNED ROUND INSTANTLY WITH A FLUSHED FACE AND AN EAGER LOOK
IT UD BE A FINE WAY O SHORTENIN THE TIME TO MAKE IT WASTE THE GOOD CANDLE
ADAM WALKED ROUND THE HOUSE AND STILL SAW NOTHING EXCEPT A RAT WHICH DARTED INTO THE WOODSHED AS HE PASSED
BY THIS TIME MOLLY HAD COME WITH BONNET AND SHAWL AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD TAKEN TOTTY ADAM PLACED THE LOCKET IN HETTY'S HAND
AND I MADE HASTE AND DID AWAY THE TURF AND THE CHOPPINGS AND TOOK OUT THE CHILD
AND NO ONE SHE SAID TO HERSELF SHOULD EVER KNOW HER MISERY AND HUMILIATION
HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
HE WILL NEVER BE A COURTIER OF VICE AND WEAR HER ORDERS IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE
ON THEM THE STILLNESS FELL RATHER FLAT AFTER THAT GLORIOUS THUMPING OF THE TABLE TOWARDS WHICH TOTTY SEATED ON HER FATHER'S KNEE CONTRIBUTED WITH HER SMALL MIGHT AND SMALL FIST
WELL BARTLE SAID MR IRWINE PUTTING OUT HIS HAND
AND IF YOU GET A GOOD NOTION IN EM IT'S PRETTY SOON WASHED OUT AGAIN
A.D PERHAPS HE'S I TH RIGHT ON T NOT TO SEE ME THOUGHT ADAM
BUT HE PATTED HER CHEEK AND SAID GOOD-BYE AGAIN
IT CAUSED MRS POMFRET TO HAVE TEA SENT UP TO HER OWN ROOM AND IT INSPIRED THAT EXEMPLARY LADY'S MAID WITH SO LIVELY A RECOLLECTION OF FORMER PASSAGES IN MRS BEST'S CONDUCT AND OF DIALOGUES IN WHICH MRS BEST HAD DECIDEDLY THE INFERIORITY AS AN INTERLOCUTOR WITH MRS POMFRET THAT HETTY REQUIRED NO MORE PRESENCE OF MIND THAN WAS DEMANDED FOR USING HER NEEDLE AND THROWING IN AN OCCASIONAL YES OR NO SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED TO PUT ON HER HAT EARLIER THAN USUAL
IF THERE SHOULD BE A POOL IN THAT WOOD
IF WE'RE MEN AND HAVE MEN'S FEELINGS I RECKON WE MUST HAVE MEN'S TROUBLES
VIXEN WAS AT ONCE ON HER LEGS AND WITHOUT FURTHER WORDS THE THREE WALKED OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT BY THE SIDE OF BARTLE'S POTATO-BEDS TO THE LITTLE GATE
AND WE MUST MAKE A NEW START
AND THE POOR THING CLINGS TO HER AS IF SHE FOUND SOME COMFORT IN HER
AT LAST THERE WAS SETH VISIBLE AT THE FARTHEST STILE AND ADAM HASTENED TO MEET HIM
I'M GOING NOW TO SEE ADAM AH THEIR POOR AGED MOTHER SAID DINAH DROPPING HER HANDS AND LOOKING BEFORE HER WITH PITYING EYES AS IF SHE SAW THE OBJECT OF HER SYMPATHY
HER OWN MISERY FILLED HER HEART--THERE WAS NO ROOM IN IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S SORROW
AND HIS SERVANTS STAYED WITH HIM TILL THEY WERE SO OLD AND POTTERING HE HAD TO HIRE OTHER FOLKS TO DO THEIR WORK WELL I SAID THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PREACHING IN THE WEEKDAYS
BUT WITH HIM TOO LEARNING WAS A HEAVY BUSINESS AND ON HIS WAY OUT TO-NIGHT HE HAD OFFERED AS USUAL A SPECIAL PRAYER FOR HELP SEEING THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS HARD TASK WITH A SINGLE EYE TO THE NOURISHMENT OF HIS SOUL--THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF TEXTS AND HYMNS WHEREWITH TO BANISH EVIL MEMORIES AND THE TEMPTATIONS OF OLD HABIT--OR IN BRIEF LANGUAGE THE DEVIL
ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MR IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND
NOT BUT WHAT HE DID GOOD TO THE RICH TOO FOR HE WAS FULL OF LOVE TO ALL MEN ONLY HE SAW AS THE POOR WERE MORE IN WANT OF HIS HELP
BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLEASANT HOMES GET INDOOR ENJOYMENTS THAT THEY WOULD NEVER THINK OF BUT FOR THE RAIN
THOSE WERE DEAR TIMES WHEN WHEATEN BREAD AND FRESH MEAT WERE DELICACIES TO WORKING PEOPLE
BUT ADAM'S MIND RUSHED BACK OVER THE PAST IN A FLOOD OF RELENTING AND PITY
I ONLY KNOW I WAS IN THE WOOD AND HEARD THE CRY
SHE MADE THEM FEEL THAT HE WAS AMONG THEM BODILY AND MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT SHOW HIMSELF TO THEM IN SOME WAY THAT WOULD STRIKE ANGUISH AND PENITENCE INTO THEIR HEARTS
YOU NEVER SAW HIM INTERFERING AND SCOLDING AND TRYING TO PLAY TH EMPEROR
SO SHE BEGAN FIDGETING WITH HER PURSE AND TURNED AS RED AS HER RIBBON
PYM WAS THERE MAKING EVERYTHING READY FOR HIM AND SOON WITH A DELIGHTFUL FRESHNESS ABOUT HIM AS IF HE WERE PREPARED TO BEGIN A NEW DAY HE WENT BACK INTO HIS DRESSING-ROOM TO OPEN HIS LETTERS
IT WAS THE SUPREME MOMENT OF HIS SUFFERING
BUT THE FIRST GLAD MOMENT IN OUR FIRST LOVE IS A VISION WHICH RETURNS TO US TO THE LAST AND BRINGS WITH IT A THRILL OF FEELING INTENSE AND SPECIAL AS THE RECURRENT SENSATION OF A SWEET ODOUR BREATHED IN A FAR-OFF HOUR OF HAPPINESS
SETH BEDE BY THE BY IS A METHODIST YES I KNOW SETH WELL AND HIS BROTHER ADAM A LITTLE
WHY HAD HE SPOKEN ALMOST AS IF HE WERE DISPLEASED WITH HER
IF IRWINE HAD SAID NOTHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HALF SO MUCH OF HETTY AS OF MEG'S LAMENESS HOWEVER IT WAS JUST THE SORT OF DAY FOR LOLLING IN THE HERMITAGE AND HE WOULD GO AND FINISH DR MOORE'S ZELUCO THERE BEFORE DINNER
THEY BELIEVED IN PRESENT MIRACLES IN INSTANTANEOUS CONVERSIONS IN REVELATIONS BY DREAMS AND VISIONS
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSITION NOT MERELY AS ONE OF POWER AND PLEASURE FOR MYSELF BUT AS A MEANS OF BENEFITING MY NEIGHBOURS
HER LOVE WAS SO LIKE THAT CALM SUNSHINE THAT THEY SEEMED TO MAKE ONE PRESENCE TO HIM AND HE BELIEVED IN THEM BOTH ALIKE
THE STRONG FIBRES BEGIN THEIR ACCUSTOMED THRILL AND WHAT WAS A MOMENT BEFORE JOY VEXATION OR AMBITION BEGINS ITS CHANGE INTO ENERGY
ADAM UNCONSCIOUS OF THE ADMIRATION HE WAS EXCITING PRESENTLY STRUCK ACROSS THE FIELDS AND NOW BROKE OUT INTO THE TUNE WHICH HAD ALL DAY LONG BEEN RUNNING IN HIS HEAD
YOU'VE NOT WON THAT GAME BY FAIR MEANS NOW SO DON'T PRETEND IT YES YES THAT'S WHAT THE BEATEN HAVE ALWAYS SAID OF GREAT CONQUERORS
BUT WE ARE NOT WITHOUT DISCIPLINE AND CORRECTION TO PUT A CHECK UPON THESE THINGS
SHE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO RAISE ANY SUSPICION THAT SHE WAS GOING TO RUN AWAY
I'VE NO WISH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU SEE TO BE BEST AND I'M SATISFIED FOR YOU TO LIVE THIRTY MILE OFF IF YOU THINK IT RIGHT
A QUEER OLD LOOKING-GLASS
THE VILLAGERS HAD PRESSED NEARER TO HER AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT GRAVE ATTENTION ON ALL FACES
THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARED SQUIRE DONNITHORNE SAY MANY A TIME
AND NOW YOU SEE WHAT SHE'S BROUGHT ME TO--THE SLY HYPOCRITICAL WENCH"--BARTLE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS IN A RASPING TONE OF REPROACH AND LOOKED AT VIXEN WHO POKED DOWN HER HEAD AND TURNED UP HER EYES TOWARDS HIM WITH A KEEN SENSE OF OPPROBRIUM--"AND CONTRIVED TO BE BROUGHT TO BED ON A SUNDAY AT CHURCH-TIME
I'D HA BEEN GLAD TO BEHAVE TO YOU LIKE A MOTHER'S SISTER IF YOU'D COME AND LIVE I THIS COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S SOME SHELTER AND VICTUAL FOR MAN AND BEAST AND FOLKS DON'T LIVE ON THE NAKED HILLS LIKE POULTRY A-SCRATCHING ON A GRAVEL BANK
FOR MY OWN PART HOWEVER I RESPECT HIM NONE THE LESS--NAY I THINK THE DEEP LOVE HE HAD FOR THAT SWEET ROUNDED BLOSSOM-LIKE DARK-EYED HETTY OF WHOSE INWARD SELF HE WAS REALLY VERY IGNORANT CAME OUT OF THE VERY STRENGTH OF HIS NATURE AND NOT OUT OF ANY INCONSISTENT WEAKNESS
I WAS TALKING TO HIM O FRIDAY AND HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT HIS GOING AWAY OH HE'S ONLY GONE TO EAGLEDALE FOR A BIT O FISHING
SHE SITS DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK AGAINST THE STOOPING STEM OF THE GREAT OAK THAT HANGS OVER THE DARK POOL
HE SHOULD HAVE ALL MONDAY BEFORE HIM THEN
BESIDES WE'VE NO RIGHT T INTERMEDDLE WITH PEOPLE'S FEELINGS WHEN THEY WOULDN'T TELL EM THEMSELVES SETH PAUSED
AND I STOOPED DOWN ON HANDS AND KNEES TO PICK IT UP
SETH ULL BE AT HOME IN HALF AN HOUR--HE'S ONLY GONE TO THE VILLAGE
CHAPTER XXV THE GAMES THE GREAT DANCE WAS NOT TO BEGIN UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK BUT FOR ANY LADS AND LASSES WHO LIKED TO DANCE ON THE SHADY GRASS BEFORE THEN THERE WAS MUSIC ALWAYS AT HAND--FOR WAS NOT THE BAND OF THE BENEFIT CLUB CAPABLE OF PLAYING EXCELLENT JIGS REELS AND HORNPIPES
AH I THINK I SHALL SEE YOUR POOR MOTHER FLITTING ABOUT IN HER WHITE DRESS WHICH LOOKED TO ME ALMOST LIKE A SHROUD THAT VERY DAY
POOR WANDERING HETTY WITH THE ROUNDED CHILDISH FACE AND THE HARD UNLOVING DESPAIRING SOUL LOOKING OUT OF IT--WITH THE NARROW HEART AND NARROW THOUGHTS NO ROOM IN THEM FOR ANY SORROWS BUT HER OWN AND TASTING THAT SORROW WITH THE MORE INTENSE BITTERNESS
BUT HE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HIMSELF IT WAS BETTER TO BE DINAH'S FRIEND AND BROTHER THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND
WHEN HE DID COME HE REMEMBERED HETTY WELL AND REMEMBERED HIS OWN JOKE ADDRESSED TO HER QUOTING IT MANY TIMES TO ADAM AND OBSERVING WITH EQUAL FREQUENCY THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN COMMON BECAUSE HETTY HAD NOT LAUGHED WHEN HE JOKED HER
HE'LL SOON TURN YOU OVER INTO THE DITCH
HE TOLD ME SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE WILL CAUSE YOU SORROW AS IT DOES ME
WILL YOU BE MY OWN WIFE TO LOVE AND TAKE CARE OF AS LONG AS I LIVE HETTY DID NOT SPEAK BUT ADAM'S FACE WAS VERY CLOSE TO HERS AND SHE PUT UP HER ROUND CHEEK AGAINST HIS LIKE A KITTEN
FOR HAVING BEGUN HIS CAREER BY FRIGHTENING AWAY THE CROWS UNDER THE LAST MARTIN POYSER BUT ONE HE COULD NEVER CEASE TO ACCOUNT THE REIGNING MARTIN A YOUNG MASTER
THEE'ST GOT THY NEW BOOK TO READ AND OFTEN WHEN SETH WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS ADAM AS HE PAUSED AFTER DRAWING A LINE WITH HIS RULER LOOKED AT HIS BROTHER WITH A KIND SMILE DAWNING IN HIS EYES
BUT NOW HE SAID ABRUPTLY LOOKING AT MR IRWINE BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY
BUT I WENT ON FOR ALL THAT
AND TO THINK O YOUR KNOWING NO BETTER MOLLY AND BEEN HERE A-GOING I NINE MONTHS AND NOT FOR WANT O TALKING TO NEITHER--AND WHAT ARE YOU STANNING THERE FOR LIKE A JACK AS IS RUN DOWN INSTEAD O GETTING YOUR WHEEL OUT
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A REAL ENGLISH RUSTIC PERFORM A SOLO DANCE
POOR LISBETH WAS SUFFERING FROM A STRANGE CONFLICT OF FEELINGS
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAR NOW WHAT
IF YOU HAD YOU WOULD BE MORE GENEROUS
IT'S A NICER JOB TO CALCULATE THEM
LAVE A CHAP ALOON WILL EE
THERE'S A VERY STRICT ORDER KEPT AMONG US AND THE BRETHREN AND SISTERS WATCH FOR EACH OTHER'S SOULS AS THEY THAT MUST GIVE ACCOUNT
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD FOR THE LOAD TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF MY FRIEND ADAM'S SHOULDERS IN A LESS PAINFUL WAY
DINAH LAID IT SIDEWAYS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE WHERE THE LIGHT WAS STRONGEST AND THEN OPENED IT WITH HER FOREFINGER
I SHOULD BE GLAD OF SOME MONEY AT A FAIR INTEREST THEN FOR I FEEL SURE I COULD PAY IT OFF IN TIME VERY WELL ADAM SAID ARTHUR REMEMBERING WHAT MR IRWINE HAD SAID ABOUT A PROBABLE HITCH IN THE LOVE-MAKING BETWEEN ADAM AND MARY BURGE WE'LL SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT AT PRESENT
I WONDER IF SHE COULD HA DONE ANY GOOD
AND BELOW THE ADDRESS WAS WRITTEN TO BE DELIVERED AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN LESS SURPRISING TO HIM THAN A LETTER FROM MR IRWINE AT THAT MOMENT
THE KIND SMILE WITH WHICH ADAM UTTERED THE LAST WORDS WAS APPARENTLY DECISIVE WITH GYP OF THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE STRANGER WAS TO BE REGARDED AND AS SHE TURNED ROUND AFTER PUTTING ASIDE HER SWEEPING-BRUSH HE TROTTED TOWARDS HER AND PUT UP HIS MUZZLE AGAINST HER HAND IN A FRIENDLY WAY
I'LL SEND NO MAN AWAY BECAUSE HE'S STUPID
IT'S LIKE WHAT I FEEL ABOUT DINAH
FOR MOST LIKE SHE'D BE WI SARAH WILLIAMSON ALICK CAME NOW WITH THE MESSAGE AND SETH FINDING THAT MRS POYSER WAS WRITING TO DINAH GAVE UP THE INTENTION OF WRITING HIMSELF
I THOUGHT SHE WAS LOVING AND TENDER-HEARTED AND WOULDN'T TELL A LIE OR ACT DECEITFUL
THERE MAY BE SOME LEADING HERE
THE IDEA OF HETTY HAD JUST CROSSED MR IRWINE'S MIND AS HE LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT ARTHUR BUT HIS DISCLAIMING INDIFFERENT ANSWER CONFIRMED THE THOUGHT WHICH HAD QUICKLY FOLLOWED--THAT THERE COULD BE NOTHING SERIOUS IN THAT DIRECTION
HE WAS NOT GIFTED WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE TEMPER AND ON MUSIC-NIGHTS IT WAS APPARENT THAT PATIENCE COULD NEVER BE AN EASY VIRTUE TO HIM
THEN I SHALL KNOW THAT MY CALLING IS NOT TOWARDS MARRIAGE
IT'S WELL SEEN WHAT CHOICE THE MOST OF EM KNOW HOW TO MAKE BY THE POOR DRAGGLE-TAILS O WIVES YOU SEE LIKE BITS O GAUZE RIBBIN GOOD FOR NOTHING WHEN THE COLOUR'S GONE WELL WELL THEE CANSTNA SAY BUT WHAT I KNOWED HOW TO MAKE A CHOICE WHEN I MARRIED THEE SAID MR POYSER WHO USUALLY SETTLED LITTLE CONJUGAL DISPUTES BY A COMPLIMENT OF THIS SORT
THERE WAS NOTHING NOW BUT THE BROWN EARTH UNDER THE WHITE THORN
ADAM LINGERED IN THE COURT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE COULD BRING HIMSELF TO SEND WORD TO DINAH THAT HE WAS COME
WHAT A SPACE OF TIME THOSE THREE MOMENTS WERE WHILE THEIR EYES MET AND HIS ARMS TOUCHED HER
YOU'LL SEE MY HUNTING-BOTTLE SOMEWHERE HE SAID
HAST ANY NOTION WHAT SHE'S DONE IT FOR HE SAID AT LAST
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE TO BE DONE APPARENTLY BEFORE SHE PUT ON HER NECKERCHIEF AND LONG SLEEVES WHICH SHE WAS TO WEAR IN THE DAY-TIME FOR NOW SHE UNLOCKED THE DRAWER THAT HELD HER PRIVATE TREASURES
SAYS I AM I A GARDENER AS KNOWS HIS BUSINESS OR ARN'T I MILLS
WITH A VAGUE ALARMED SENSE THAT SHE MUST SOMEHOW COMPORT HERSELF DIFFERENTLY SHE HASTENED HER STEP A LITTLE TOWARDS THE FAR DEAL TABLE WHERE SHE MIGHT SET DOWN HER CANS--CAUGHT HER FOOT IN HER APRON WHICH HAD BECOME UNTIED AND FELL WITH A CRASH AND A SPLASH INTO A POOL OF BEER
I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER
WE MUST TAKE TIME TO CONSIDER
I WANT TO CONSULT HIM ABOUT A LITTLE MATTER
EVERY WOMAN WAS YOUNG IN HER TURN AND HAD HER CHANCES OF MATRIMONY WHICH IT WAS A POINT OF HONOUR FOR OTHER WOMEN NOT TO SPOIL--JUST AS ONE MARKET-WOMAN WHO HAS SOLD HER OWN EGGS MUST NOT TRY TO BALK ANOTHER OF A CUSTOMER
COME NOW THE HORSES ARE READY CHAPTER XL THE BITTER WATERS SPREAD MR
DEAR AUNT HE SAID AFFECTIONATELY AS HE HELD HER HAND YOUR LOSS IS THE GREATEST OF ALL BUT YOU MUST TELL ME HOW TO TRY AND MAKE IT UP TO YOU ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT WAS SO SUDDEN AND SO DREADFUL ARTHUR POOR MISS LYDIA BEGAN POURING OUT HER LITTLE PLAINTS AND ARTHUR SAT DOWN TO LISTEN WITH IMPATIENT PATIENCE
IT WAS PART OF THAT GROWING TENDERNESS WHICH CAME FROM THE SORROW AT WORK WITHIN HIM
AND IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL A SAFE CONCLUSION THAT THE NEXT BEST MAN YOU MAY HAPPEN TO SEE WITH A BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF-COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM
IN SPITE OF OTHER FEELINGS DOMINANT IN HIM THIS EVENING HIS PRIDE WINCED UNDER ADAM'S MODE OF TREATING HIM
I INQUIRED ALL ABOUT HIM OF MR IRWINE
NOW MESTER IRWINE WAS AS DIFFERENT AS COULD BE
THERE WAS NO SPEAKING FOR MINUTES AFTER
SHE'S LIKE A PICTUR IN A SHOP-WINDER
NOT AT ALL LIKE THAT SLOUCHING LUKE BRITTON WHO WHEN SHE ONCE WALKED WITH HIM ALL THE WAY FROM BROXTON TO HAYSLOPE HAD ONLY BROKEN SILENCE TO REMARK THAT THE GREY GOOSE HAD BEGUN TO LAY
AND THERE WERE LIBERAL TOUCHES OF CRIMSON TOWARD THE CHANCEL FOR THE PULPIT AND MR DONNITHORNE'S OWN PEW HAD HANDSOME CRIMSON CLOTH CUSHIONS
AND A MAN NEVER LIES WITH MORE DELICIOUS LANGUOR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A PASSION THAN WHEN HE HAS PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT HE SHALL SUBDUE IT TO-MORROW
BUT ONE OF THE ELDERLY WOMEN BENDING DOWN TO TAKE HIM BY THE SHOULDER WITH AN AIR OF GRAVE REMONSTRANCE TIMOTHY'S BESS'S BEN FIRST KICKED OUT VIGOROUSLY THEN TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND SOUGHT REFUGE BEHIND HIS FATHER'S LEGS
BUT NOW SETH SPOKE
HE WAS WORN WITH ANXIETY AND EXERTION AND HIS MOTHER'S LIGHT WORDS WERE ALMOST INTOLERABLE
SAVIOUR OF SINNERS
HE WAS PROMPTED TO EXPRESS HIS DISBELIEF VERY STRONGLY--PERHAPS THAT HE MIGHT CALL FORTH THE PROOFS IF THERE WERE ANY TO BE OFFERED
IF HE LAUGHS SHE'LL MATCH HIM WITH WHIMPERING
EVERYBODY WOULD KNOW THE REASON
THEN CAME A PIECE OF CHEESE AND A QUART JUG WITH A CROWN OF FOAM UPON IT
IT WAS A LAME STORY AND THE LANDLADY LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT HETTY AS SHE TOLD IT
I'VE BEEN TURNING IT OVER IN MY MIND HE CONTINUED LOOKING AT MR POYSER TO MAKE A BIT MORE CONVENENCE AT HOME FOR NICE JOBS O CABINET-MAKING
THE MOVEMENT WAS OBLIGED TO BE IN TRIPLE TIME
SHE WANTED TO BE CARESSED--SHE WANTED TO FEEL AS IF ARTHUR WERE WITH HER AGAIN
IT WAS A LONG WHILE--MORE THAN AN HOUR BEFORE ARTHUR HAD BROUGHT HIS MEDITATIONS TO THIS POINT
DO YOU KNOW MRS POYSER--SIT DOWN PRAY BOTH OF YOU--I'VE BEEN FAR FROM CONTENTED FOR SOME TIME WITH MRS SATCHELL'S DAIRY MANAGEMENT
ADAM BEDE THOUGHT SO AS HE GLANCED AT HER FOR A MOMENT ON RISING FROM HIS KNEES
I CAN ATE IT WI'OUT ITS TURNIN MY STOMACH
IT WAS A VERY OLD STORY BUT ADAM KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT SO HE DRANK IN THE SWEET DELUSION
I'M SURE I SHOULD PROFIT BY IT IN THE END
SILENCE WAS MORE JUST THAN REPROACH
BUT HE SAW HER PLAINLY ENOUGH WITHOUT LOOKING
CARROLL WILL BRING IT IN DIRECTLY I WANT TO GO TO THE HALL FARM TOO SAID MR IRWINE TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE LITTLE METHODIST WHO IS STAYING THERE
IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SUN WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY
AND IF DINAH HAD SEEN AS I DID WE'D HA LEFT THE WESLEYANS AND JOINED A BODY THAT UD PUT NO BONDS ON CHRISTIAN LIBERTY NAY LAD NAY SAID ADAM SHE WAS RIGHT AND THEE WAST WRONG
ADAM WAS DETERMINED TO STAY NO LONGER
HETTY DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY COULD BE VERY FOND OF MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE
IT WAS A MUCH SMALLER HAND THAN HER OWN BUT IT WAS NOT WHITE AND DELICATE FOR DINAH HAD NEVER WORN A GLOVE IN HER LIFE AND HER HAND BORE THE TRACES OF LABOUR FROM HER CHILDHOOD UPWARDS
BUT YOU ARE QUITE AS MUCH CONCERNED IN IT IF NOT MORE
THERE WERE BUT TWO ALTERNATIVES IN HIS MIND
HIS WORK AS YOU KNOW HAD ALWAYS BEEN PART OF HIS RELIGION AND FROM VERY EARLY DAYS HE SAW CLEARLY THAT GOOD CARPENTRY WAS GOD'S WILL--WAS THAT FORM OF GOD'S WILL THAT MOST IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED HIM
THEY MUST SING TH ANTHEM WITHOUT ME TO-DAY CHAPTER LII ADAM AND DINAH IT WAS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN ADAM ENTERED THE FARMYARD AND ROUSED ALICK AND THE DOGS FROM THEIR SUNDAY DOZING
MOREOVER HETTY WAS PARTICULARLY CLEVER AT MAKING UP THE BUTTER
A SAD THING'S HAPPENED
IT'S POOR AMENDS PITY ULL MAKE US PITY SAID THE GRANDFATHER SHARPLY
HOW CANST TALK O MA'IN THINGS COMFORTABLE
MR MASSEY HE SAID AT LAST PUSHING THE HAIR OFF HIS FOREHEAD I'LL GO BACK WITH YOU
THOUGH IF DINAH LIKES TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE SHE CAN BE THE MOST COMFORT TO FOLKS SHE'S I THE RIGHT TO LIVE O THIS SIDE
THEN MERE FIELDS AND HEDGES THEIR VICINITY TO A MARKET-TOWN CARRYING AN AGREEABLE SUGGESTION OF HIGH RENT TILL THE LAND BEGAN TO ASSUME A TRIMMER LOOK THE WOODS WERE MORE FREQUENT AND AT LENGTH A WHITE OR RED MANSION LOOKED DOWN FROM A MODERATE EMINENCE OR ALLOWED HIM TO BE AWARE OF ITS PARAPET AND CHIMNEYS AMONG THE DENSE-LOOKING MASSES OF OAKS AND ELMS--MASSES REDDENED NOW WITH EARLY BUDS
STRETCH FORTH THY HAND THOU WHO ART MIGHTY TO SAVE TO THE UTTERMOST AND RESCUE THIS LOST ONE
BUT NO SOONER HAD HE LICKED UP HIS SUPPER THAN HE WENT BACK TO HIS MASTER WHILE LISBETH SAT DOWN ALONE TO CRY OVER HER KNITTING
THEY SAY FOLKS ALLAYS GROON WHEN THEY'RE HEARKENIN TO TH METHODYS AS IF THEY WAR BAD I TH INSIDE
HE STRUCK A LIGHT AS THEY ENTERED THE DARK CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE CONDEMNED CELL AND THEN SAID IN HIS MOST CIVIL TONE IT'LL BE PRETTY NIGH DARK IN THE CELL A'READY BUT I CAN STOP WITH MY LIGHT A BIT IF YOU LIKE NAY FRIEND THANK YOU SAID DINAH
BUT DO NOT IMAGINE THEM GATHERED IN A KNOT
HOW COME YOU PUT THEM THINGS ON EH ADAM SAID HE LIKED DINAH'S CAP AND GOWN BETTER NOR MY CLOTHES SAID HETTY SITTING DOWN DEMURELY
THERE WAS A HARD TASK BEFORE HIM FOR AT THAT MOMENT HE FELT HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP THREE YEARS OF HIS YOUTH FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ABANDONING HIMSELF WITHOUT REMORSE TO HIS PASSION FOR HETTY
THIS SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WAS AN ADDITIONAL REASON FOR NOT BEING LOUD SINCE SATCHELL HIMSELF MIGHT PRESENTLY BE WALKING UP THE PAVED ROAD TO THE CHURCH DOOR
BUT WUNNA YE COME IN ADAM
SHE PROVOKED ME PAST BEARING SOMETIMES
MARTIN POYSER WAS THERE--THE WHOLE POYSER FAMILY
MR IRWINE'S SEEN EM IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND HE SAYS THEY'VE PLENTY O FINE FELLOWS AMONG EM
IT WILL COME ON PROBABLY A WEEK TO-MORROW
WHEN THEY ROSE FROM THEIR KNEES SETH WENT TO ADAM AGAIN AND SAID WILT ONLY LIE DOWN FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AND LET ME GO ON THE WHILE NO SETH NO
I HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AT HAYSLOPE THE SAME EVENING I HEARD YOU PREACH AND RECOGNIZED HIM IN COURT TO-DAY ILL AS HE LOOKED AH SIR CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT HIM
TOWARDS ARTHUR EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE INCURRED NO NEW GUILT ADAM FELT THAT HE WAS NOT BOUND TO KEEP SILENCE WHEN HETTY'S INTEREST CALLED ON HIM TO SPEAK
AN IF YOUR REVERENCE SEES WELL AND GOOD I'LL SEND MY BOY TO TELL EM AS SOON AS I GET HOME
I THINK I SEE THE DOOR OPEN THERE
IT WAS THE BOUNDARY MARK OF HIS YOUTH--THE SIGN TO HIM OF THE TIME WHEN SOME OF HIS EARLIEST STRONGEST FEELINGS HAD LEFT HIM
HE WAS VERY KNOWING ABOUT DOCTRINES AND USED TO CALL EM THE BULWARKS OF THE REFORMATION
HE SAW THERE WAS NO OTHER MEANS OF PUTTING AN END TO THE DIALOGUE
FOR WHEN I'D GOTTEN MY OLD MAN I WAR WORRETED FROM MORN TILL NIGHT
WE SHALL BE NONE THE WORSE FRIENDS IN FUTURE I HOPE BECAUSE WE'VE FOUGHT
THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT SHE GOT IN LEICESTER FOR THE MEN STARED AT HER AS SHE WENT ALONG THE STREET AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE HETTY WISHED NO ONE WOULD LOOK AT HER
HE MADE NOT A SINGLE MOVEMENT BUT KNELT LIKE AN IMAGE OF DESPAIR GAZING AT AN IMAGE OF DEATH
FRIGHTENED VERY FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY FIRST BROUGHT HER IN
EVERYBODY IN COURT FELT FOR HIM--IT WAS LIKE ONE SOB THE SOUND THEY MADE WHEN HE CAME DOWN AGAIN
AND TO TURN MY BACK ON THE HILLS WHERE THE POOR PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE SUCH A HARD LIFE AND THE MEN SPEND THEIR DAYS IN THE MINES AWAY FROM THE SUNLIGHT
I MUST GO FROM YOU AND WE MUST SUBMIT OURSELVES ENTIRELY TO THE DIVINE WILL
YOU'VE BEEN HINDERED FROM GOING TO CHURCH TO-DAY DOUBTLESS YES ADAM SAID AND THEN PAUSED BEFORE HE ADDED I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU
IT MAKES YOU THINK THE WORLD'S COMFORTABLE-LIKE
AND SHE'S GOING NEXT WEEK
SO I MUST GO BACK TO THE FARM TO-NIGHT THAT I MAY HAVE THE LAST DAY WITH MY AUNT AND HER CHILDREN
GO AND EAT THY SUPPER AND SHUT THE DOOR SO AS I MAYN'T HEAR MOTHER'S TALK SETH KNEW THAT ADAM ALWAYS MEANT WHAT HE SAID AND WAS NOT TO BE PERSUADED INTO MEANING ANYTHING ELSE
THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE ART OF GETTING RICH BUT THEY ARE MEN OF TRUST AND WHEN THEY DIE BEFORE THE WORK IS ALL OUT OF THEM IT IS AS IF SOME MAIN SCREW HAD GOT LOOSE IN A MACHINE
WE CAN AFFORD IT--I'VE TOLD THEE OFTEN ENOUGH
WHEN PEOPLE ASKED ADAM WHOSE LITTLE LAD HE WAS HE HAD A SENSE OF DISTINCTION AS HE ANSWERED I'M THIAS BEDE'S LAD HE WAS QUITE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW THIAS BEDE--DIDN'T HE MAKE THE WONDERFUL PIGEON-HOUSE AT BROXTON PARSONAGE
HIS PROJECT WAS QUITE APPROVED AT THE FARM WHEN HE WENT THERE ON SATURDAY EVENING
MR POYSER HAD SMOKED HIS EVENING PIPE AND NOW HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AS THE ONLY RESOURCE OF A MAN WHO CONTINUES TO SIT UP AFTER THE DAY'S BUSINESS IS DONE
AND AS ADAM STEPPED AWAY FROM THE TREE TO CONTINUE HIS WALK HIS EYES FELL ON TWO FIGURES ABOUT TWENTY YARDS BEFORE HIM
AN I WISH I WAR THERE TOO I'STID O BEIN LEFT TO TAKE UP MERRIER FOLKS'S ROOM ABOVE GROUND NAY DON'T LOOK AT IT I THAT WAY MOTHER SAID ADAM WHO WAS DETERMINED TO BE GENTLE TO HER TO-DAY
BUT SHE SHALL BE INDULGED AS MUCH AS SHE INDULGES HER FAT FIDO THE WHEELS OF ARTHUR'S CHAISE HAD BEEN ANXIOUSLY LISTENED FOR AT THE CHASE FOR TO-DAY WAS FRIDAY AND THE FUNERAL HAD ALREADY BEEN DEFERRED TWO DAYS
THE DAYLIGHT'S LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO STARE I THE BOOKE AS I CANNA READ
I NE'ER SAID THAT ON YE YE MAY TAKE IT ALL FOR WHAT I CARE SAID BESS THE MAIDEN WITH A PETTISH MOVEMENT BEGINNING TO WIPE AWAY HER TEARS AND RECOVER HERSELF
THE CHILD ULL RUN IN IF SHE'S TOLD AN I KNOW HETTY'S LETTIN HER EAT TOO MANY CURRANTS
BUT YE'VE GOT THE SAME LOOK TOO HERE LISBETH TURNED TO DINAH I RECKON IT'S WI BEIN A METHODY
FOR I DOUBT ADAM'S HEART IS SO SET ON HER HE'LL NEVER TURN TO ANYBODY ELSE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE'S TOO GOOD AND HOLY FOR ANY MAN LET ALONE ME AND THE WORDS HE HAD BEEN SUMMONING RUSHED BACK AGAIN BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED HIS LIPS
POOR THING HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT'S ALLAYS LIKELY
SHE ASKED ME TO KISS HER TWICE WHEN WE PARTED ADAM HAD REFOLDED THE LETTER AND WAS SITTING MEDITATIVELY WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS ARM AT THE HEAD OF THE BED WHEN SETH CAME UPSTAIRS
THEE MAY'ST WELL TALK O TROUBLE BEIN A GOOD THING SETH FOR THEE THRIV'ST ON'T
AND THE SOUND OF THE GURGLING BROOK IF YOU CAME CLOSE TO ONE SPOT BEHIND A SMALL BUSH WOULD BE MINGLED FOR YOUR EAR WITH A DESPAIRING HUMAN SOB
AND WHEN HE OPENED HIS EYES IT WAS NOT AT ALL STARTLING TO SEE HER STANDING NEAR HIM
IT CAN BE SHOWN TO AFFECT THE PRICE OF BREAD AND THE RATE OF WAGES TO CALL FORTH MANY EVIL TEMPERS FROM THE SELFISH AND MANY HEROISMS FROM THE SYMPATHETIC AND IN OTHER WAYS TO PLAY NO SMALL PART IN THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE
YOU WILL STAY YOURSELF AND HELP MR IRWINE TO CARRY OUT THE REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ESTATE THERE'S ONE THING SIR THAT PERHAPS YOU DON'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF SAID ADAM WITH HESITATING GENTLENESS AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE ME HANG BACK LONGER
DON'T YOU GO OFF THE LORD KNOWS WHERE EVERY SUNDAY A-PREACHING AND PRAYING
PRONE EVEN TO SCIENTIFIC THEORIZING AND CURSORY PEEPS THROUGH MICROSCOPES
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT THE CHASE FARM IS T US--WE'VE CUMBER ENOUGH WI OUR OWN FARM
GOOD-NIGHT MY WENCH GOOD-NIGHT CHAPTER XV THE TWO BED-CHAMBERS HETTY AND DINAH BOTH SLEPT IN THE SECOND STORY IN ROOMS ADJOINING EACH OTHER MEAGRELY FURNISHED ROOMS WITH NO BLINDS TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT WHICH WAS NOW BEGINNING TO GATHER NEW STRENGTH FROM THE RISING OF THE MOON--MORE THAN ENOUGH STRENGTH TO ENABLE HETTY TO MOVE ABOUT AND UNDRESS WITH PERFECT COMFORT
KEEP YOUR DIRTY FINGERS TO THAT WHY Y ARE GETTIN AS BIG A SAINT AS SETH
EVIL SPREADS AS NECESSARILY AS DISEASE
I'VE BEEN TO THE COMMON SAID SETH
EVEN IDLENESS IS EAGER NOW--EAGER FOR AMUSEMENT
HE MUST KNOW ADAM AND MIGHT TELL HIM WHERE SHE WAS GONE FOR IT IS DIFFICULT TO COUNTRY PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO MAKE A FIGURE IN THEIR OWN PARISH ARE NOT KNOWN EVERYWHERE ELSE AND IT WAS EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO HETTY TO UNDERSTAND THAT CHANCE WORDS COULD HAPPEN TO APPLY CLOSELY TO HER CIRCUMSTANCES
HE'S GOT SOME PROJECT OR OTHER ABOUT LETTING THE CHASE FARM AND BARGAINING FOR A SUPPLY OF MILK AND BUTTER FOR THE HOUSE
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ALL THE LABOURERS AND SEE THEM TOUCHING THEIR HATS TO ME WITH A LOOK OF GOODWILL BRAVO ARTHUR
I'M NONE FOR WORRETING SAID MR POYSER RISING FROM HIS THREE-CORNERED CHAIR AND WALKING SLOWLY TOWARDS THE DOOR
HETTY WOULD LOOK SO WHEN HE TOLD HER WHAT HE HAD TO TELL HER
HE THOUGHT HE COULD CONQUER HIS BITTERNESS TOWARDS ADAM NOW--COULD OFFER HIM HIS HAND AND ASK TO BE HIS FRIEND AGAIN IN SPITE OF THAT PAINFUL MEMORY WHICH WOULD STILL MAKE HIS EARS BURN
I THOUGHT HE'D BE HOME SOON
THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UPWARDS RARELY AS GENIUSES MOST COMMONLY AS PAINSTAKING HONEST MEN WITH THE SKILL AND CONSCIENCE TO DO WELL THE TASKS THAT LIE BEFORE THEM
WE COULD NEVER SEE HIM
YOU'LL LAUGH O TH OTHER SIDE O YOUR MOUTH THEN CATCH ME AT IT ADAM
IT MAY SEEM A CONTRADICTION BUT ARTHUR GATHERED A CERTAIN CARELESSNESS AND CONFIDENCE FROM HIS TIMIDITY
AND WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK I KNOW YOU'VE DISTURBED HER MIND
BUT THIS LITTLE THING WOULD BE SPOKEN ILL OF DIRECTLY IF SHE HAPPENED TO BE SEEN WALKING WITH HIM
BUT GYP WAS WATCHING HIS MASTER WITH WRINKLED BROW AND EARS ERECT PUZZLED AT THIS UNUSUAL COURSE OF THINGS
WELL I FELT SOME DOUBT ABOUT IT WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM AND HE SEEMED TO HESITATE AT FIRST
BUT ONCE ARRIVED THERE HE COULD STAY NO LONGER AT THE HERMITAGE
CHAPTER L IN THE COTTAGE ADAM DID NOT ASK DINAH TO TAKE HIS ARM WHEN THEY GOT OUT INTO THE LANE
BUT HE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH A VAGUE CONFIDENCE IN HIS ARM AND BRAIN
THE LETTERS HE COMPLAINED WERE SO UNCOMMON ALIKE THERE WAS NO TELLIN EM ONE FROM ANOTHER THE SAWYER'S BUSINESS NOT BEING CONCERNED WITH MINUTE DIFFERENCES SUCH AS EXIST BETWEEN A LETTER WITH ITS TAIL TURNED UP AND A LETTER WITH ITS TAIL TURNED DOWN
SHE HAD COME ONLY THIS LITTLE WAY AND YET FELT TIRED AND ALMOST HUNGRY AGAIN IN THE KEEN MORNING AIR
HE HAD TRIED TO MAKE UNPLEASANT FEELINGS MORE BEARABLE BY DRINKING A LITTLE MORE WINE THAN USUAL AT DINNER TO-DAY AND WAS STILL ENOUGH UNDER ITS FLATTERING INFLUENCE TO THINK MORE LIGHTLY OF THIS UNWISHED-FOR RENCONTRE WITH ADAM THAN HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
THEY MAY LET GROWLER LOOSE IF ANYBODY OFFERS TO DO MISCHIEF AND THERE'S ALICK'S DOG TOO READY ENOUGH TO SET HIS TOOTH IN A TRAMP IF ALICK GIVES HIM A WINK MRS POYSER ACCEPTED THIS COMPROMISE BUT THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO BAR AND BOLT TO THE UTMOST
AND WHENEVER YOU ENTER ON YOUR CAREER OF MODEL LANDLORD MAY I BE THERE TO SEE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THESE THINGS HAPPENING AT HAYSLOPE IN SIGHT OF HER AUNT
HETTY HAD NEVER BLUSHED AT SEEING HIM BEFORE
ASK FOR MY MAN PYM AND TELL HIM TO GET IT FROM MILLS AND NOT TO SAY I'M AT THE HERMITAGE
THE WESLEYANS YOU KNOW ARE STRONG ARMINIANS
ON A HEAP OF THOSE SOFT SHAVINGS A ROUGH GREY SHEPHERD DOG HAD MADE HIMSELF A PLEASANT BED AND WAS LYING WITH HIS NOSE BETWEEN HIS FORE-PAWS OCCASIONALLY WRINKLING HIS BROWS TO CAST A GLANCE AT THE TALLEST OF THE FIVE WORKMEN WHO WAS CARVING A SHIELD IN THE CENTRE OF A WOODEN MANTELPIECE
I CAN BEAR TO HEAR HER SPEAK WITHOUT WANTING TO PUT WOOL IN MY EARS
PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY DO IMPROVE THE FACTS A LITTLE THEN
THE CHIEF POINT HOWEVER WAS TO CHASE AWAY THE NOTION FROM HIS MOTHER'S MIND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
STRANGE PERHAPS YOU WILL SAY THIS RUSH OF IMPULSE TO-WARDS A COURSE THAT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THE MOST REPUGNANT TO HER PRESENT STATE OF MIND AND IN ONLY THE SECOND NIGHT OF HER SADNESS YES THE ACTIONS OF A LITTLE TRIVIAL SOUL LIKE HETTY'S STRUGGLING AMIDST THE SERIOUS SAD DESTINIES OF A HUMAN BEING ARE STRANGE
IT'S COWARDLY OF ME TO KEEP AWAY
HE KNEW SHE HAD NOT HAD TIME TO READ THE LETTER BUT HE DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS BUOYED UP BY A SECRET HOPE THAT THE LETTER WOULD CONTRADICT EVERYTHING HE HAD SAID
IT IS SUCH A FOND ANXIOUS MOTHER'S VOICE THAT YOU HEAR AS LISBETH SAYS WELL MY LAD IT'S GONE SEVEN BY TH CLOCK
CHRISTIAN FOLKS CAN'T BE MARRIED LIKE CUCKOOS I RECKON I'M A BIT DAUNTED THOUGH SAID MR POYSER WHEN I THINK AS WE MAY HAVE NOTICE TO QUIT AND BELIKE BE FORCED TO TAKE A FARM TWENTY MILE OFF EH SAID THE OLD MAN STARING AT THE FLOOR AND LIFTING HIS HANDS UP AND DOWN WHILE HIS ARMS RESTED ON THE ELBOWS OF HIS CHAIR IT'S A POOR TALE IF I MUN LEAVE TH OULD SPOT AN BE BURIED IN A STRANGE PARISH
HE'S LIKE AS IF HE WAS STRUCK FOR DEATH THIS DAY OR TWO--HE'S SO CAST DOWN
FOR WHAT'S THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT ABOUT AS YOU'RE SO FOND O READING TO THE BOYS BUT DOING WHAT OTHER FOLKS UD HAVE YOU DO
ARTHUR FELT CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD LAUGH THE THING OFF AND EXPLAIN IT AWAY
ON THESE POINTS HE WOULD HAVE MAINTAINED HIS OPINION AGAINST THE LARGEST LANDED PROPRIETOR IN LOAMSHIRE OR STONYSHIRE EITHER
AND I CANNOT PRETEND THAT ADAM IN THESE PAINFUL DAYS FELT NOTHING BUT RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION AND LOVING PITY
I'VE HAD MY SUPPER SAID ADAM
THESE THINGS WERE ALL FLAT AND DREARY TO HER NOW
AT LAST HETTY SPOKE IN A TONE OF BESEECHING DINAH...HELP ME...I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING LIKE YOU...MY HEART IS HARD DINAH HELD THE CLINGING HAND AND ALL HER SOUL WENT FORTH IN HER VOICE
AND BARTLE HIMSELF'S NEVER IN BED TILL IT'S GONE ELEVEN I WOULDNA HAVE HIM TO LIVE WI ME THEN SAID MRS POYSER A-DROPPING CANDLE-GREASE ABOUT AS YOU'RE LIKE TO TUMBLE DOWN O THE FLOOR THE FIRST THING I THE MORNING AYE ELEVEN O'CLOCK'S LATE--IT'S LATE SAID OLD MARTIN
HE WAS NOT WRONG IN THINKING THAT A CHANGE HAD COME OVER HETTY
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE KITCHEN WHEN LISBETH ENTERED AND THREW HERSELF INTO THE CHAIR
TO HETTY THE PARISH WAS NEXT TO THE PRISON IN OBLOQUY AND TO ASK ANYTHING OF STRANGERS--TO BEG--LAY IN THE SAME FAR-OFF HIDEOUS REGION OF INTOLERABLE SHAME THAT HETTY HAD ALL HER LIFE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE SHE COULD EVER COME NEAR
SHE FELT SO HELPLESS NOW SO UNABLE TO FASHION THE FUTURE FOR HERSELF THAT THE PROSPECT OF THROWING HERSELF ON HIM HAD A RELIEF IN IT WHICH WAS STRONGER THAN HER PRIDE
SETH SAID SHE WAS WELL THIS MORNING NO SHE'S VERY HEARTY TO-DAY SAID ADAM HAPPY IN THE SIGNS OF DINAH'S FEELING AT THE SIGHT OF HIM BUT SHY
I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN THANK YOU
WHEN I'VE SAID A THING IF IT'S ONLY TO MYSELF IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GO BACK YES THAT'S JUST WHAT I EXPECTED OF YOU SAID ARTHUR
HE TOOK UP THE PIECE OF PAPER WHICH HETTY HANDED ACROSS THE TABLE AND READ THE ADDRESS
THE BARKING HAD ITS EFFECT IN THE HOUSE FOR AS DINAH AND HETTY APPROACHED THE DOORWAY WAS FILLED BY A PORTLY FIGURE WITH A RUDDY BLACK-EYED FACE WHICH BORE IN IT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOOKING EXTREMELY ACUTE AND OCCASIONALLY CONTEMPTUOUS ON MARKET-DAYS BUT HAD NOW A PREDOMINANT AFTER-SUPPER EXPRESSION OF HEARTY GOOD-NATURE
WELL SAID BARTLE TAKING OFF HIS SPECTACLES AND PUTTING THEM INTO HIS POCKET IF THERE MUST BE WOMEN TO MAKE TROUBLE IN THE WORLD IT'S BUT FAIR THERE SHOULD BE WOMEN TO BE COMFORTERS UNDER IT
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD OR ACTED A LIE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
HETTY SHE SAID GENTLY DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS THAT SITS BY YOUR SIDE YES HETTY ANSWERED SLOWLY IT'S DINAH AND DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN WE WERE AT THE HALL FARM TOGETHER AND THAT NIGHT WHEN I TOLD YOU TO BE SURE AND THINK OF ME AS A FRIEND IN TROUBLE YES SAID HETTY
BUT IT SEEMS IT WAS ONLY MEANT FOR MY TRIAL
DEEP UNSPEAKABLE SUFFERING MAY WELL BE CALLED A BAPTISM A REGENERATION THE INITIATION INTO A NEW STATE
SHE CURTSIED HERSELF
BUT WIRY BEN HAVING HAD THE WORST IN THE BODILY CONTEST WAS BENT ON RETRIEVING THAT HUMILIATION BY A SUCCESS IN SARCASM
HE FORESAW A SERIES OF COMPLAINTS TENDING TO NOTHING
WE SHALL ALL BE BETTER IN A NEW COUNTRY THOUGH THERE'S SOME I SHALL BE LOATH TO LEAVE BEHIND
WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM HOW FAR A MAN IS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN DEED IS ONE THAT MIGHT WELL MAKE US TREMBLE TO LOOK INTO IT
I LIKE BREAKFAST-TIME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MOMENT IN THE DAY SAID MR IRWINE
LEISURE IS GONE--GONE WHERE THE SPINNING-WHEELS ARE GONE AND THE PACK-HORSES AND THE SLOW WAGGONS AND THE PEDLARS WHO BROUGHT BARGAINS TO THE DOOR ON SUNNY AFTERNOONS
BUT COME YOUR REVERENCE ARE YOU FOR A RIDE WITH ME
SHE WAS ALONE ON HER LITTLE ISLAND OF DREAMS AND ALL AROUND HER WAS THE DARK UNKNOWN WATER WHERE ARTHUR WAS GONE
YOU WON'T THINK O GOING
IT'LL BE BETTER FOR ME TO SPEAK PLAIN HE SAID WITH EVIDENT EFFORT THOUGH IT'S HARD WORK
IT HAD BETTER HA BEEN LEFT TO THE MEN--IT HAD BETTER HA BEEN LEFT TO THE MEN
UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
FOR THEE'DST ALLAYS LIE STILL WI THY EYES OPEN AN ADAM NE'ER UD LIE STILL A MINUTE WHEN HE WAKENED
SHE WAS AWARE TOO THAT MR CRAIG THE GARDENER AT THE CHASE WAS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH HER AND HAD LATELY MADE UNMISTAKABLE AVOWALS IN LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRIES AND HYPERBOLICAL PEAS
LITTLE TEARFUL ROSE
THERE WOULD SOON BE NO MORE SUSPENSE
IF HETTY HAD KNOWN HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CRIED
LET US RATHER BE THANKFUL THAT OUR SORROW LIVES IN US AS AN INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE ONLY CHANGING ITS FORM AS FORCES DO AND PASSING FROM PAIN INTO SYMPATHY--THE ONE POOR WORD WHICH INCLUDES ALL OUR BEST INSIGHT AND OUR BEST LOVE
YOU ARE GLAD TO HAVE ME WITH YOU YOU WON'T LEAVE ME DINAH
HE HAD FOUND OUT THE DREAM IN WHICH SHE WAS LIVING--THAT SHE WAS TO BE A LADY IN SILKS AND SATINS--AND WHEN HE HAD FIRST TALKED TO HER ABOUT HIS GOING AWAY SHE HAD ASKED HIM TREMBLINGLY TO LET HER GO WITH HIM AND BE MARRIED
FOR AT THIS TIME OF YEAR OF COURSE EVERY ONE GOES TO BED WHILE IT IS YET LIGHT OR AT LEAST LIGHT ENOUGH TO DISCERN THE OUTLINE OF OBJECTS AFTER YOU HAVE BRUISED YOUR SHINS AGAINST THEM
MRS POYSER WAS AT THE HEAD OF THIS TABLE AND TOTTY WAS NOW SEATED IN HER LAP BENDING HER SMALL NOSE DEEP DOWN INTO A WINE-GLASS IN SEARCH OF THE NUTS FLOATING THERE
AND YET A DAY ON WHICH A BLIGHTING SORROW MAY FALL UPON A MAN
JOSHUA TELLS ME SHE WAS PREACHING ON THE GREEN LAST NIGHT OH BY JOVE SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE LAUGHING
TOM SAFT WAS A GREAT FAVOURITE ON THE FARM WHERE HE PLAYED THE PART OF THE OLD JESTER AND MADE UP FOR HIS PRACTICAL DEFICIENCIES BY HIS SUCCESS IN REPARTEE
AND YET THE TIME OF HARVEST AND INGATHERING IS NOT COME AND WE TREMBLE AT THE POSSIBLE STORMS THAT MAY RUIN THE PRECIOUS FRUIT IN THE MOMENT OF ITS RIPENESS
BUT I NEVER KNEW YOU SO INCLINED FOR MORAL DISCUSSION ARTHUR
IT WAS HETTY'S BASKET
I DOUBT HE HASNA HAD MUCH FUN CHAPTER XXVI THE DANCE ARTHUR HAD CHOSEN THE ENTRANCE-HALL FOR THE BALLROOM
HE WON'T BRING THE OTHER PEOPLE IN HAYSLOPE ROUND TO HIS OPINION WHILE YOU GO ON SINGING AS WELL AS YOU DO YES SIR BUT IT TURNS A MAN'S STOMACH T HEAR THE SCRIPTURE MISUSED I THAT WAY
I'VE SOMETHING VERY PAINFUL TO TELL YOU--SOMETHING AS IT'LL PAIN YOU TO HEAR AS WELL AS ME TO TELL
BUT HE SPEAKS JUST THE SAME AND SMILES AT ME JUST AS HE DID WHEN HE WAS A LAD
AT LAST TIM'S NEXT NEIGHBOUR BEN THOLOWAY BEGAN TO GIVE EMPHASIS TO HIS SPEECH BY NUDGES AT WHICH TIM GROWING RATHER SAVAGE SAID LET ME ALOOAN WILL YE
MOST O THE WOMEN DO MORE HARM NOR GOOD WITH THEIR PREACHING--THEY'VE NOT GOT DINAH'S GIFT NOR HER SPERRIT--AND SHE'S SEEN THAT AND SHE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO SET TH EXAMPLE O SUBMITTING FOR SHE'S NOT HELD FROM OTHER SORTS O TEACHING
WHEN THE KITCHEN WAS TO HER MIND DINAH WENT INTO THE NEW ROOM WHERE ADAM HAD BEEN WRITING THE NIGHT BEFORE TO SEE WHAT SWEEPING AND DUSTING WERE NEEDED THERE
WELL I COULD DO WI'T IF SO BE YE WANT TO GET RID ON'T SAID THE DISINTERESTED COUSIN WALKING QUICKLY AWAY WITH THE BUNDLE LEST CHAD'S BESS SHOULD CHANGE HER MIND
THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY BRINGING WITH IT A SENSE OF ADDED STRENGTH
BELIKE WE MAY BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN
WHY HE'S ALTERED AND YET NOT ALTERED
READ IT WHEN YOU'RE BY YOURSELF
THERE IS NO MAN OR WOMAN BORN INTO THIS WORLD TO WHOM SOME OF THESE TRIALS DO NOT FALL AND SO I FEEL THAT SOME OF THEM MUST HAPPEN TO YOU
AND YOU'LL BE AMONG ALL YOUR OWN FRIENDS AS LOVE YOU AND CAN HELP EM AND BE A BLESSING TO EM TILL THEIR DYING DAY
HAST EVER HAD ANY NOTION OF IT BEFORE TO BE SURE I HAVE SAID MRS POYSER WHO ALWAYS DECLINED IF POSSIBLE TO BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE
I ONLY SAID THEY SEEMED TO SUIT DINAH
BUT THIS WAS TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE DANCER IN SO PECULIAR AND COMPLEX A MANNER THAT NO ONE COULD DENY HIM THE PRAISE OF ORIGINALITY
SHE'S USEFUL TO THEE I THE WORK SORRY
BUT HETTY WAS AT THAT MOMENT QUITE CARELESS OF ANY GLANCES--SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE THOUGHT THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WOULD SOON BE COMING INTO CHURCH FOR THE CARRIAGE MUST SURELY BE AT THE CHURCH-GATE BY THIS TIME
THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF ATTITUDE NO GESTURE
WHAT A SILLY YOU MUST BE A COMMENT WHICH TOMMY FOLLOWED UP BY SEIZING DINAH WITH BOTH ARMS AND DANCING ALONG BY HER SIDE WITH INCOMMODIOUS FONDNESS
THERE DAUPHIN TELL ME WHAT THAT IS SAYS THIS MAGNIFICENT OLD LADY AS SHE DEPOSITS HER QUEEN VERY QUIETLY AND FOLDS HER ARMS
THEN DINAH ADAM SAID AT LAST HOW CAN THERE BE ANYTHING CONTRARY TO WHAT'S RIGHT IN OUR BELONGING TO ONE ANOTHER AND SPENDING OUR LIVES TOGETHER
TRY AND READ THAT LETTER ADAM ADAM TOOK THE LETTER BETWEEN HIS SHAKING HANDS AND TRIED TO FIX HIS EYES STEADILY ON IT
AND THROUGH THIS GATE SHE CAN GET INTO A FIELD-PATH BEHIND THE WIDE THICK HEDGEROWS
NO ONE EXCEPT ADAM KNEW ANYTHING OF WHAT HAD PASSED--NO ONE ELSE WAS LIKELY TO KNOW
I SHOULD THINK HE WILL MAKE YOU HIS PARTNER SOON
HE WAS BOUND IN HONOUR TO SAY NO WORD THAT COULD INJURE HETTY
YOU CAN BEAR SORROW MANFULLY AS WELL AS ACT MANFULLY
WHO PUT THIS GREAT LOVE INTO OUR HEARTS
I KNOW IT VERY WELL
AND THEN HE WOULD ASK HER TO FIX SOME TIME WHEN HE MIGHT GO TO SNOWFIELD AND LEARN WHETHER THE LAST BEST HOPE THAT HAD BEEN BORN TO HIM MUST BE RESIGNED LIKE THE REST
WAS SHE THERE
SEE IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT
HE COULD NOT SHUT OUT THE WORDS
BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MR IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER
HER BEAUTY HER WELL-PRESERVED FACULTIES AND HER OLD-FASHIONED DIGNITY MADE HER A GRACEFUL SUBJECT FOR CONVERSATION IN TURN WITH THE KING'S HEALTH THE SWEET NEW PATTERNS IN COTTON DRESSES THE NEWS FROM EGYPT AND LORD DACEY'S LAWSUIT WHICH WAS FRETTING POOR LADY DACEY TO DEATH
MR IRWINE READ ME PART OF A LETTER FROM HIM YESTERDAY
BUT ALREADY SOME ONE ELSE WAS ASTIR IN THE HOUSE AND HAD GONE DOWNSTAIRS PRECEDED BY GYP
FOR THE MORNING SUN FELL ASLANT ON THE GREAT GLASS GLOBE WITH GOLD FISH IN IT WHICH STOOD ON A SCAGLIOLA PILLAR IN FRONT OF THE READY-SPREAD BACHELOR BREAKFAST-TABLE AND BY THE SIDE OF THIS BREAKFAST-TABLE WAS A GROUP WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE ANY ROOM ENTICING
THERE'S NO BAD NEWS I HOPE NO NOTHING BAD ADAM ANSWERED AS HE WENT UP TO DINAH AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER
AND HE SAT WATCHING WHAT WENT FORWARD WITH THE QUIET OUTWARD GLANCE OF HEALTHY OLD AGE WHICH DISENGAGED FROM ANY INTEREST IN AN INWARD DRAMA SPIES OUT PINS UPON THE FLOOR FOLLOWS ONE'S MINUTEST MOTIONS WITH AN UNEXPECTANT PURPOSELESS TENACITY WATCHES THE FLICKERING OF THE FLAME OR THE SUN-GLEAMS ON THE WALL COUNTS THE QUARRIES ON THE FLOOR WATCHES EVEN THE HAND OF THE CLOCK AND PLEASES ITSELF WITH DETECTING A RHYTHM IN THE TICK
YES I'M FONDER ON HER NOR SHE DESERVES--A LITTLE HARD-HEARTED HUSSY WANTING TO LEAVE US I THAT WAY
SHE FELT A DEEP LONGING TO GO NOW AND POUR INTO HETTY'S EAR ALL THE WORDS OF TENDER WARNING AND APPEAL THAT RUSHED INTO HER MIND
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN HER SAID MISS IRWINE
THAT WAS NOT THE SORT OF PRETTINESS SHE CARED ABOUT BUT SHE DID CARE ABOUT THE PRETTINESS OF THE NEW THINGS SHE WOULD BUY FOR HERSELF AT TREDDLESTON FAIR WITH THE MONEY THEY FETCHED
COME TELL ME HETTY TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM WHISPERED I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T COME AND SLOWLY GOT COURAGE TO LIFT HER EYES TO HIM
THE WORK HE HAD TO DO AT HOME BESIDES PUTTING ON HIS BEST CLOTHES MADE IT SEVEN BEFORE HE WAS ON HIS WAY AGAIN TO THE HALL FARM AND IT WAS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER WITH HIS LONGEST AND QUICKEST STRIDES HE SHOULD BE THERE IN TIME EVEN FOR THE ROAST BEEF WHICH CAME AFTER THE PLUM PUDDING FOR MRS POYSER'S SUPPER WOULD BE PUNCTUAL
IS IT SOMETHING YOU'VE ARRANGED ARTHUR
ADAM STAYED TILL HE KNEW MRS POYSER EXPECTED HIM TO GO ENGAGING HER AND HER HUSBAND IN TALK AS CONSTANTLY AS HE COULD FOR THE SAKE OF LEAVING HETTY MORE AT EASE
HE WOULD GO TO EAGLEDALE IN SPITE OF MEG'S LAMENESS--GO ON RATTLER AND LET PYM FOLLOW AS WELL AS HE COULD ON THE OLD HACK
BUT THERE'S THAT WILL MASKERY SIR AS IS THE RAMPAGEOUSEST METHODIS AS CAN BE AN I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WAS HIM AS STIRRED UP TH YOUNG WOMAN TO PREACH LAST NIGHT AN HE'LL BE A-BRINGIN OTHER FOLKS TO PREACH FROM TREDDLES'ON IF HIS COMB ISN'T CUT A BIT
I THINK PEOPLE LIVE LIKE PIGS FOR MY PART
THE FAULT HAS ALL BEEN MINE FOR THOUGH I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RESIST THE LONGING TO BE NEAR YOU I HAVE FELT ALL THE WHILE THAT YOUR AFFECTION FOR ME MIGHT CAUSE YOU GRIEF
AND YET HE HAD BEEN SO DETERMINED THIS MORNING BEFORE HE WENT TO GAWAINE'S
THEY MIGHT HA COOKED THE DINNERS I THAT OPEN SPACE AN SAVED THE FIRES
TO PREVENT SUCH A SURPRISE SHE ALWAYS BOLTED HER DOOR AND SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN TO DO SO TO-NIGHT
NEVER CRAWLING CRAFTY REPTILIAN
THEY DON'T GO EVERY ONE HIS OWN WAY AND SAY AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER BUT TELL ME--IF I MAY ASK AND I AM REALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING IT--HOW YOU FIRST CAME TO THINK OF PREACHING INDEED SIR I DIDN'T THINK OF IT AT ALL--I'D BEEN USED FROM THE TIME I WAS SIXTEEN TO TALK TO THE LITTLE CHILDREN AND TEACH THEM AND SOMETIMES I HAD HAD MY HEART ENLARGED TO SPEAK IN CLASS AND WAS MUCH DRAWN OUT IN PRAYER WITH THE SICK
SELDOM IN ADAM'S LIFE HAD HIS FACE BEEN SO FREE FROM ANY CLOUD OF ANXIETY AS IT WAS THIS MORNING
SHE WAS AT WINDSOR AT LAST NOT FAR FROM ARTHUR
A YOUNG WOMAN STARTED FROM OUR COUNTRY TO SEE DINAH FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT
HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN--FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING--WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH WELL SIR I THINK AS IT'S RETHER HARD WHEN MRS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK-HOUSE
LET ME TAKE MY TURN NOW AND DO THEE GO TO BED SAID SETH
AN I HOPE AN WE ALL HOPE AS HE'LL LIVE TO SEE US OLD FOLKS AN OUR CHILDREN GROWN TO MEN AN WOMEN AN YOUR HONOUR A FAMILY MAN
IT'S ALL YOUR OWN WILFULNESS AS I TELL YOU FOR THERE'S NOBODY NO CALL TO BREAK ANYTHING IF THEY'LL ONLY GO THE RIGHT WAY TO WORK
AND BESIDES THIS THERE WAS A GRAND BAND HIRED FROM ROSSETER WHO WITH THEIR WONDERFUL WIND-INSTRUMENTS AND PUFFED-OUT CHEEKS WERE THEMSELVES A DELIGHTFUL SHOW TO THE SMALL BOYS AND GIRLS
WILL MASKERY COMES TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND DOES HIS WHEELWRIGHT'S BUSINESS STEADILY IN THE WEEKDAYS AND AS LONG AS HE DOES THAT HE MUST BE LET ALONE AH SIR BUT WHEN HE COMES TO CHURCH HE SITS AN SHAKES HIS HEAD AN LOOKS AS SOUR AN AS COXY WHEN WE'RE A-SINGIN AS I SHOULD LIKE TO FETCH HIM A RAP ACROSS THE JOWL--GOD FORGI'E ME--AN MRS IRWINE AN YOUR REVERENCE TOO FOR SPEAKIN SO AFORE YOU
IT'S ONE OF THE CARPENTERS--I FORGET HIS NAME AT THIS MOMENT IT'S BEN CRANAGE--WIRY BEN THEY CALL HIM SAID MR IRWINE
AND HETTY
BUT THE OTHER YOUNG WOMAN--IS SHE AT HOME OR GONE ALONG WITH DINAH THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AT ADAM WITH A BEWILDERED AIR
SHE'S BEEN SITTING I THE DARK AS USUAL
LISBETH SAT WATCHING HER AS SHE MOVED ABOUT IN HER STILL QUICK WAY AND SAID AT LAST YE'VE GOT A NOTION O CLEANIN UP
FINE FOLKS THEY ARE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT AS LOOK AS IF THEY'D NEVER TASTED NOTHING BETTER THAN BACON-SWORD AND SOUR-CAKE I THEIR LIVES
THAT THE NEW SENSIBILITIES BOUGHT BY A DEEP EXPERIENCE WERE SO MANY NEW FIBRES BY WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE NAY NECESSARY TO HIM THAT HIS NATURE SHOULD INTERTWINE WITH ANOTHER
BUT TOMMY MUST HAVE THE START UP TO THE NEXT STILE BECAUSE HE'S THE SMALLEST ADAM HAD NEVER BEHAVED SO MUCH LIKE A DETERMINED LOVER BEFORE
DEAR FRIENDS SHE SAID AT LAST BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHOM I LOVE AS THOSE FOR WHOM MY LORD HAS DIED BELIEVE ME I KNOW WHAT THIS GREAT BLESSEDNESS IS
WE WERE AFRAID TO THINK WHAT GOD WAS BEFORE--THE GOD WHO MADE THE WORLD AND THE SKY AND THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
IS IT ANY NEWS HE SAID
WHEN HE WAS A LAD OF SEVEN HE ONE DAY KICKED DOWN AN OLD GARDENER'S PITCHER OF BROTH FROM NO MOTIVE BUT A KICKING IMPULSE NOT REFLECTING THAT IT WAS THE OLD MAN'S DINNER
YOU MAY SAY TO YOURSELVES I'M ONE FOOL AND JACK'S ANOTHER
ADAM HAD QUITE A PRIDE IN THE LITTLE SQUIRE IN THOSE EARLY DAYS AND THE FEELING HAD ONLY BECOME SLIGHTLY MODIFIED AS THE FAIR-HAIRED LAD HAD GROWN INTO THE WHISKERED YOUNG MAN
SO HE GAVE HIS FACE UP TO HILARITY UNCHILLED BY MORAL JUDGMENTS
THE CHURCH-BELLS HAD STRUCK UP AGAIN NOW--A LAST TUNE BEFORE THE RINGERS CAME DOWN THE HILL TO HAVE THEIR SHARE IN THE FESTIVAL
WHAT DOST MEAN WHY THEE'T NEVER LOOK AT NOTHIN NOR THINK O NOTHIN BUT THY FIGURIN AN THY WORK SAID LISBETH HALF-CRYING
ONE PIECE OF WORK THAT ADAM WAS SUPERINTENDING WAS SOME SLIGHT REPAIRS AT THE CHASE FARM WHICH HAD BEEN HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY SATCHELL AS BAILIFF BUT WHICH IT WAS NOW RUMOURED THAT THE OLD SQUIRE WAS GOING TO LET TO A SMART MAN IN TOP-BOOTS WHO HAD BEEN SEEN TO RIDE OVER IT ONE DAY
IF YOU'LL SEND IT TO MR BURGE'S SHOP I THE MORNING I'LL GET IT DONE FOR YOU BY WEDNESDAY
AND HETTY'S DREAMS WERE ALL OF LUXURIES
GOOD-NIGHT MRS POYSER
IT WAS TOUCHING TO SEE THESE THREE BIG MEN WITH THE MARKS OF THEIR HARD LABOUR ABOUT THEM ANXIOUSLY BENDING OVER THE WORN BOOKS AND PAINFULLY MAKING OUT THE GRASS IS GREEN THE STICKS ARE DRY THE CORN IS RIPE"--A VERY HARD LESSON TO PASS TO AFTER COLUMNS OF SINGLE WORDS ALL ALIKE EXCEPT IN THE FIRST LETTER
SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
BUT WHERE'S THE USE O TALKIN TO ME A-THAT'N
HER WONDER INCREASED
IT'LL BE SUCH A SIGHT AS WONNA COME O'ER AGAIN TO SEE EM GET DOWN AN WALK ALONG ALL TOGETHER
YES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN TO BE GONE THROUGH WITH HIS MOTHER BUT IT WAS A CASE IN WHICH HE MUST MAKE HER FEEL THAT HIS WILL WAS STRONG--IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER IN THE END
SHE CLUNG TO THE COMFORTING HOPEFUL WORDS ARTHUR HAD UTTERED IN THEIR LAST MEETING--"I SHALL COME AGAIN AT CHRISTMAS AND THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE SHE CLUNG TO THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS SO FOND OF HER HE WOULD NEVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER
WHAT DOST MEAN BY TURNIN WORKI'DAY INTO SUNDAY A-THAT'N
THE GREAT BULL-DOG CHAINED AGAINST THE STABLES IS THROWN INTO FURIOUS EXASPERATION BY THE UNWARY APPROACH OF A COCK TOO NEAR THE MOUTH OF HIS KENNEL AND SENDS FORTH A THUNDERING BARK WHICH IS ANSWERED BY TWO FOX-HOUNDS SHUT UP IN THE OPPOSITE COW-HOUSE
I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING O THIS SORT FOR IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN MY WAGES
IT WAS JUST SUCH A PICTURE AS THIS LAST THAT HAYSLOPE CHURCH HAD MADE TO THE TRAVELLER AS HE BEGAN TO MOUNT THE GENTLE SLOPE LEADING TO ITS PLEASANT UPLANDS AND NOW FROM HIS STATION NEAR THE GREEN HE HAD BEFORE HIM IN ONE VIEW NEARLY ALL THE OTHER TYPICAL FEATURES OF THIS PLEASANT LAND
DO NOT BELIEVE THEM
AND WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T TAKE IN LODGERS THE PRISONER BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID SHE WAS TOO TIRED TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE AND SHE ONLY WANTED A BED FOR ONE NIGHT
IT HAD EVIDENTLY HAD A JOURNEY THIS MORNING AND MUST BELONG TO SOME ONE WHO HAD COME ON BUSINESS
I'VE HEARD A DEAL O DOCTRINE I MY TIME FOR I USED TO GO AFTER THE DISSENTING PREACHERS ALONG WI SETH WHEN I WAS A LAD O SEVENTEEN AND GOT PUZZLING MYSELF A DEAL ABOUT TH ARMINIANS AND THE CALVINISTS
HE FELT SURE IT WOULD BE A FINE DAY FOR EVERYBODY ABOUT HAYSLOPE WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE CAME INTO THE ESTATE--SUCH A GENEROUS OPEN-HEARTED DISPOSITION AS HE HAD AND AN UNCOMMON NOTION ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS CONSIDERING HE WAS ONLY JUST COMING OF AGE
Y'AREN'T GOING AWAY FOR EVER AND IF YOU LEAVE HER BEHIND WITH A NOTION IN HER HEAD O YOUR FEELING ABOUT HER THE SAME AS SHE FEELS ABOUT YOU SHE'LL BE HANKERING AFTER YOU AND THE MISCHIEF MAY GET WORSE
BUT YOU'D LIKE A DRINK O WHEY FIRST P'R'APS
AND BESIDES I'VE NOT MUCH MIND TO WORK UNDER HIM
WHAT'S THEE GOT THY SUNDAY CLOOSE ON FOR SAID LISBETH COMPLAININGLY AS HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
IT SOUNDS LIKE A TEX
I WASNA DRIVING AT THEE IN WHAT I SAID JUST NOW
THE DOORS WERE ALL CLOSED AND THE VERY STONES AND TUBS SEEMED QUIETER THAN USUAL
YOU SAY THEY ARE ALL WELL
AND AS TO PEOPLE SAYING A FEW IDLE WORDS ABOUT US WE MUST NOT MIND THAT ANY MORE THAN THE OLD CHURCH-STEEPLE MINDS THE ROOKS CAWING ABOUT IT
I'M NOT A-GOING TO TURN METHODIST ANY MORE NOR YOU ARE--THOUGH IT'S LIKE ENOUGH YOU'LL TURN TO SOMETHING WORSE
IT IS OF LITTLE USE FOR ME TO SAY HOW LOVELY WAS THE CONTOUR OF HER PINK-AND-WHITE NECKERCHIEF TUCKED INTO HER LOW PLUM-COLOURED STUFF BODICE OR HOW THE LINEN BUTTER-MAKING APRON WITH ITS BIB SEEMED A THING TO BE IMITATED IN SILK BY DUCHESSES SINCE IT FELL IN SUCH CHARMING LINES OR HOW HER BROWN STOCKINGS AND THICK-SOLED BUCKLED SHOES LOST ALL THAT CLUMSINESS WHICH THEY MUST CERTAINLY HAVE HAD WHEN EMPTY OF HER FOOT AND ANKLE--OF LITTLE USE UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN A WOMAN WHO AFFECTED YOU AS HETTY AFFECTED HER BEHOLDERS FOR OTHERWISE THOUGH YOU MIGHT CONJURE UP THE IMAGE OF A LOVELY WOMAN SHE WOULD NOT IN THE LEAST RESEMBLE THAT DISTRACTING KITTENLIKE MAIDEN
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING TO YOU
COME IN ADAM AND REST
AND WHAT BETTER HARVEST FROM THAT PAINFUL SEED-TIME COULD THERE BE THAN THIS
WE KNOW VERY WELL WE ARE ALTOGETHER IN THE HANDS OF GOD
AND NOW WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR THERE WAS THE CANDLE BURNT OUT IN THE SOCKET
THEE MUST GO AN SEE THY BROTHER AN BRING ME WORD WHAT HE'S A-DOIN MESTER IRWINE SAID HE'D COME AN TELL ME BUT I CANNA MAKE OUT SO WELL WHAT IT MEANS WHEN HE TELLS ME
IT'S GOOD TO LIVE ONLY A MOMENT AT A TIME AS I'VE READ IN ONE OF MR WESLEY'S BOOKS
I HAD ONLY ONE ROOM BUT THERE WERE TWO BEDS IN IT AND I TOLD HER SHE MIGHT STAY WITH ME
IT SOOTHED HIM BY GENTLE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS HOPES
HER GREAT DARK EYES WANDER BLANKLY OVER THE FIELDS LIKE THE EYES OF ONE WHO IS DESOLATE HOMELESS UNLOVED NOT THE PROMISED BRIDE OF A BRAVE TENDER MAN
THERE ARE FEW PROPHETS IN THE WORLD
THE STILL TWILIGHT WITH ITS DYING WESTERN RED AND ITS FEW FAINT STRUGGLING STARS RESTED ON THE FARM-YARD WHERE THERE WAS NOT A SOUND TO BE HEARD BUT THE STAMPING OF THE CART-HORSES IN THE STABLE
ADAM SAT LOOKING BLANKLY BEFORE HIM BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE OBJECTS THAT WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS EYES--THE COUNSEL AND ATTORNEYS TALKING WITH AN AIR OF COOL BUSINESS AND MR IRWINE IN LOW EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH THE JUDGE--DID NOT SEE MR IRWINE SIT DOWN AGAIN IN AGITATION AND SHAKE HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY WHEN SOMEBODY WHISPERED TO HIM
HE REMAINED AS MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE AND TURNED ALMOST AS PALE
I'LL GO AND CALL HIM I FELT QUITE ASHAMED OF HAVING SPOKEN SO ABRUPTLY TO HER
IT GAVE HIM A CONSCIOUSNESS OF WELL-BEING THAT MADE ACTIVITY DELIGHTFUL
SHE COULD HARDLY DARE TO SHAPE THE THOUGHT--YET HOW ELSE COULD IT BE
I SHALL THINK OF YOU OFTEN WHEN I'M AT SNOWFIELD AND SEE YOUR FACE BEFORE ME AS IT IS NOW
AWAY FROM HIM SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY ALL THE MOTIVES TO SELF-CONTROL
HE'S A SENSIBLE MAN ENOUGH
SHE HURRIED AFTER HIM AND LAID HOLD OF HIS ARM BEFORE HE HAD GOT HALF-WAY DOWN TO THE BROOK AND SAID NAY MY LAD THEE WUTNA GO AWAY ANGERED WI THY MOTHER AN HER GOT NOUGHT TO DO BUT TO SIT BY HERSEN AN THINK ON THEE NAY NAY MOTHER SAID ADAM GRAVELY AND STANDING STILL WHILE HE PUT HIS ARM ON HER SHOULDER I'M NOT ANGERED
SHE SAYS SHE'S SURE DINAH FEELS FOR ME MORE THAN COMMON AND UD BE WILLING T HAVE ME
BUT HE SAW CLEARLY THAT THE SECRET MUST BE KNOWN BEFORE LONG EVEN APART FROM ADAM'S DETERMINATION SINCE IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE SUPPOSED THAT HETTY WOULD PERSIST TO THE END IN HER OBSTINATE SILENCE
WELL HE WOULD WALK
IT WAS ONCE THE HALL
FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER TILL SETH WAS MARRIED AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BUILT A BIT THEMSELVES TO THE OLD HOUSE AND MADE MORE ROOM
BUT I'VE THE MORE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU CAPTAIN AND TO YOU MR IRWINE AND TO ALL MY FRIENDS HERE WHO'VE DRUNK MY HEALTH AND WISHED ME WELL
OH NO NO DANGER HE SAID AS INDIFFERENTLY AS HE COULD
I'M GOING STRAIGHT HOME FOR I'VE GOT A LOT O TIMBER VALUATIONS TO WRITE OUT WHY ADAM LAD ARE YOU HERE SAID MR POYSER ENTERING WARM AND COATLESS WITH THE TWO BLACK-EYED BOYS BEHIND HIM STILL LOOKING AS MUCH LIKE HIM AS TWO SMALL ELEPHANTS ARE LIKE A LARGE ONE
I HAD SOME PRIVATE TALK AND PRAYER WITH HER AFTERWARDS AND I TRUST HER HEART IS TOUCHED
I LOVE YOU NEXT TO GOD WHO MADE ME DINAH'S LIPS BECAME PALE LIKE HER CHEEKS AND SHE TREMBLED VIOLENTLY UNDER THE SHOCK OF PAINFUL JOY
PERHAPS YOU THINK HE WAS NOT--AS HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN--A LIVING DEMONSTRATION OF THE BENEFITS ATTACHED TO A NATIONAL CHURCH
I'VE DESIRED HETTY TO REMEMBER AS SHE'S GOT TO DANCE WI YOU SIR SAID THE GOOD INNOCENT WOMAN
THEE ARTNA GOIN TO TH SCHOOL I THY BEST COAT NO MOTHER SAID ADAM QUIETLY
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT AT ASHBY I COME FROM STONITON
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS FOLKS ENOW T HELP I THIS PARISH WI'OUT GOING FURTHER OFF
HIS FATHER PERHAPS WOULD COME IN ASHAMED TO MEET HIS SON'S GLANCE--WOULD SIT DOWN LOOKING OLDER AND MORE TOTTERING THAN HE HAD DONE THE MORNING BEFORE AND HANG DOWN HIS HEAD EXAMINING THE FLOOR-QUARRIES
YOU CAN'T BE HAPPY THEN TO MAKE THE HALL FARM YOUR HOME DINAH ADAM SAID WITH THE QUIET INTEREST OF A BROTHER WHO HAS NO ANXIETY FOR HIMSELF IN THE MATTER
I MUST KNOW WHAT GROUND I'M TREADING ON
A MAN DOESNA WANT TO SEE FUR TO KNOW AS TH ENGLISH ULL BEAT THE FRENCH
AND YOU KNOW THE SPINNING'S GOING ON CONSTANT AND THERE'S NEW LINEN WOVE TWICE AS FAST AS THE OLD WEARS OUT
I HAVE ORDERED A HORSE FOR YOU TO RIDE WITH US AS SOON AS YOU CAN COMPOSE YOURSELF WHILE MR IRWINE WAS SPEAKING ADAM RECOVERED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE ACTUAL SCENE
SHE SAW NOTHING AT FIRST BUT A FACE--A PURE PALE FACE WITH LOVING GREY EYES AND IT WAS QUITE UNKNOWN TO HER
PITY AND SOFTENED MEMORY TOOK PLACE OF THE OLD ANTAGONISM AND IN HIS BUSY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE AS THE CHAISE CARRIED HIM RAPIDLY ALONG TOWARDS THE HOME WHERE HE WAS NOW TO BE MASTER THERE WAS A CONTINUALLY RECURRING EFFORT TO REMEMBER ANYTHING BY WHICH HE COULD SHOW A REGARD FOR HIS GRANDFATHER'S WISHES WITHOUT COUNTERACTING HIS OWN CHERISHED AIMS FOR THE GOOD OF THE TENANTS AND THE ESTATE
IF YOU CAN BRING ME ANY PROOF THAT HE INTERFERES WITH HIS NEIGHBOURS AND CREATES ANY DISTURBANCE I SHALL THINK IT MY DUTY AS A CLERGYMAN AND A MAGISTRATE TO INTERFERE
TO SIT IN A CARPETED PARLOUR AND ALWAYS WEAR WHITE STOCKINGS
AND I'M SURE WHENEVER YOU'RE PLEASED TO DANCE WITH HER SHE'LL BE PROUD AND THANKFUL IF SHE STOOD STILL ALL THE REST O TH EVENING OH NO NO THAT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL TO ALL THE OTHER YOUNG FELLOWS WHO CAN DANCE
IF YOU FEEL AS YOU MAY HA PUT FALSE NOTIONS INTO HER MIND AND MADE HER BELIEVE AS YOU LOVED HER WHEN ALL THE WHILE YOU MEANT NOTHING I'VE THIS DEMAND TO MAKE OF YOU--I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR MYSELF BUT FOR HER
OFTEN AS DINAH HAD VISITED LISBETH DURING THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS SHE HAD NEVER SLEPT IN THE COTTAGE SINCE THAT NIGHT AFTER THIAS'S DEATH WHEN YOU REMEMBER LISBETH PRAISED HER DEFT MOVEMENTS AND EVEN GAVE A MODIFIED APPROVAL TO HER PORRIDGE
BUT WE HAVE NO FAIR GROUND FOR ENTERTAINING UNFAVOURABLE AUGURIES CONCERNING ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WHO THIS MORNING PROVES HIMSELF CAPABLE OF A PRUDENT RESOLUTION FOUNDED ON CONSCIENCE
WHO SAID I WAR ANGERED
BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AS IF SPEECH CAME TO ME WITHOUT ANY WILL OF MY OWN AND WORDS WERE GIVEN TO ME THAT CAME OUT AS THE TEARS COME BECAUSE OUR HEARTS ARE FULL AND WE CAN'T HELP IT
WE HAND FOLKS OVER TO GOD'S MERCY AND SHOW NONE OURSELVES
ADAM COULD STILL BE DECEIVED
FIND HER A GOOD HUSBAND SOMEWHERE I THE PARISH
AN SCARCENESS IS WHAT THERE'S THE BIGGEST STOCK OF I THAT COUNTRY DINAH SMILED BUT GAVE NO PROMISE TO STAY AND THEY TALKED OF OTHER THINGS THROUGH THE REST OF THE WALK LINGERING IN THE SUNSHINE TO LOOK AT THE GREAT FLOCK OF GEESE GRAZING AT THE NEW CORN-RICKS AND AT THE SURPRISING ABUNDANCE OF FRUIT ON THE OLD PEAR-TREE
PAINT US AN ANGEL IF YOU CAN WITH A FLOATING VIOLET ROBE AND A FACE PALED BY THE CELESTIAL LIGHT
THERE WERE LEAFY WALLS OF SCARLET BEANS AND LATE PEAS
IT WAS A PLACE THAT THROUGH THE REST OF THE YEAR WAS HAUNTED WITH THE SHADOWY MEMORIES OF OLD KINGS AND QUEENS UNHAPPY DISCROWNED IMPRISONED
AND IN THAT LETTER I TOLD HER TO LET ME KNOW IF SHE WERE IN ANY TROUBLE
MR JOSHUA RANN HAVING A SLIGHT TOUCH OF RHEUMATISM DID NOT JOIN IN THE RINGING OF THE BELLS THIS MORNING AND LOOKING ON WITH SOME CONTEMPT AT THESE INFORMAL GREETINGS WHICH REQUIRED NO OFFICIAL CO-OPERATION FROM THE CLERK BEGAN TO HUM IN HIS MUSICAL BASS OH WHAT A JOYFUL THING IT IS BY WAY OF PRELUDING A LITTLE TO THE EFFECT HE INTENDED TO PRODUCE IN THE WEDDING PSALM NEXT SUNDAY
FOR MY PART I WAS NEVER OVERFOND O GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS--THEY'RE MOSTLY LIKE THE FINE LADIES FAT DOGS NAYTHER GOOD FOR BARKING NOR BUTCHER'S MEAT BUT ON'Y FOR SHOW AND ANOTHER EVENING SHE WAS GONE TO TREDDLESTON TO BUY SOME THINGS
IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MR IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR...WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW
IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE COMMON COARSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO PICTURESQUE SENTIMENTAL WRETCHEDNESS
IT IS FOR THIS RARE PRECIOUS QUALITY OF TRUTHFULNESS THAT I DELIGHT IN MANY DUTCH PAINTINGS WHICH LOFTY-MINDED PEOPLE DESPISE
AT LAST HETTY WHISPERED I DID DO IT DINAH...I BURIED IT IN THE WOOD...THE LITTLE BABY...AND IT CRIED...I HEARD IT CRY...EVER SUCH A WAY OFF...ALL NIGHT...AND I WENT BACK BECAUSE IT CRIED SHE PAUSED AND THEN SPOKE HURRIEDLY IN A LOUDER PLEADING TONE
SHE THOUGHT OF HER LACE CAPS AND SAVED ALL HER MONEY TO BUY EM
HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS THE DOOR AND AS DINAH ENTERED LIFTING UP HER MILD GREY EYES TOWARDS HIM SHE SAW AT ONCE THE GREAT CHANGE THAT HAD COME SINCE THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UP AT THE TALL MAN IN THE COTTAGE
GO AN DO WHAT THEE'T ORDERED TO DO AN ME AND SETH ULL GO WHOME
IT'S RIGHT FOR ME TO DO WHAT I CAN TO SAVE YOU FROM GETTING INTO TROUBLE FOR WANT O YOUR KNOWING WHERE YOU'RE BEING LED TO
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW SHE NEVER WANTED TO GO OUT NOW--INDEED COULD HARDLY BE PERSUADED TO GO
AN HE'S BEEN A-THREATENIN TO GO AWAY AGAIN SHE WENT ON WHIMPERING AN I'M FAST SURE HE'LL GO SOME DAWNIN AFORE I'M UP AN NIVER LET ME KNOW AFOREHAND AN HE'LL NIVER COME BACK AGAIN WHEN ONCE HE'S GONE
THE SUNLIGHT THROUGH THE APPLE-TREE BOUGHS THE RED BUNCHES HETTY'S SWEET BLUSH
SHE HAD HAD A LETTER FROM DINAH LATELY FULL OF KIND WORDS ABOUT THE COMING MARRIAGE WHICH SHE HAD HEARD OF FROM SETH
SEVERAL TIMES THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD CONSULT MR IRWINE BUT THAT WOULD BE USELESS UNLESS HE TOLD HIM ALL AND SO BETRAYED THE SECRET ABOUT ARTHUR
IN THE COURSE OF THINGS WE MAY EXPECT THAT IF I LIVE I SHALL ONE DAY OR OTHER BE YOUR LANDLORD
THEE'ST GOT FEATHERS AND LINEN TO SPARE--PLENTY EH THIS QUESTION WAS OF COURSE ADDRESSED TO MRS POYSER WHO WAS WRAPPED UP IN A WARM SHAWL AND WAS TOO HOARSE TO SPEAK WITH HER USUAL FACILITY
THE NEXT THOUGHT THAT OCCURRED TO HIM WAS ONE THAT MADE HIM SLIP OFF HIS SHOES AND TREAD LIGHTLY UPSTAIRS TO LISTEN AT THE BEDROOM DOORS
ARTHUR DONNITHORNE TOO HAD THE SAME SORT OF NOTION ABOUT HETTY SO FAR AS HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER NATURE OF ALL
THERE WAS NONE OF THE STRONG ALE HERE OF COURSE BUT WINE AND DESSERT--SPARKLING GOOSEBERRY FOR THE YOUNG ONES AND SOME GOOD SHERRY FOR THE MOTHERS
BUT A GARDENER IS SCOTCH AS A FRENCH TEACHER IS PARISIAN
BUT SHE'D NEVER BEEN THERE AND SHE TOOK THE COACH TO STONITON AND BEYOND THAT I CAN'T TRACE HER
THEIR EMPLOYERS WERE THE RICHER FOR THEM THE WORK OF THEIR HANDS HAS WORN WELL AND THE WORK OF THEIR BRAINS HAS GUIDED WELL THE HANDS OF OTHER MEN
THE AFTERNOON SUN WAS WARM ON THE FIVE WORKMEN THERE BUSY UPON DOORS AND WINDOW-FRAMES AND WAINSCOTING
THE PRETTY CREATURE WAS IN ONE OF THE INNER STABLES AND TURNED HER MILD HEAD AS HER MASTER CAME BESIDE HER
BUT THEE DOSTNA TELL ADAM WHAT HE SAID TO THEE ABOUT IT ONE DAY
SHE'S GOT THE RIGHT VENOM TO STING HIM WITH--THE RIGHT VENOM TO STING HIM WITH YES SAID MRS POYSER I KNOW WHAT THE MEN LIKE--A POOR SOFT AS UD SIMPER AT EM LIKE THE PICTURE O THE SUN WHETHER THEY DID RIGHT OR WRONG AN SAY THANK YOU FOR A KICK AN PRETEND SHE DIDNA KNOW WHICH END SHE STOOD UPPERMOST TILL HER HUSBAND TOLD HER
WELL VIXEN WELL THEN HOW ARE THE BABBIES SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER MAKING HASTE TOWARDS THE CHIMNEY-CORNER AND HOLDING THE CANDLE OVER THE LOW HAMPER WHERE TWO EXTREMELY BLIND PUPPIES LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE LIGHT FROM A NEST OF FLANNEL AND WOOL
THERE ARE TWO ROADS BEFORE HER--ONE ALONG BY THE HEDGEROW WHICH WILL BY AND BY LEAD HER INTO THE ROAD AGAIN THE OTHER ACROSS THE FIELDS WHICH WILL TAKE HER MUCH FARTHER OUT OF THE WAY INTO THE SCANTLANDS LOW SHROUDED PASTURES WHERE SHE WILL SEE NOBODY
BUT HER HEART'S SO TAKEN UP WITH OTHER THINGS
I HANNA SLEP MORE NOR FOUR HOUR THIS NIGHT AS IS PAST AN GONE
I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY SETH THAT YOU WOULD TRY TO BE A HELP AND NOT A HINDRANCE TO MY WORK
CURIOUSLY IN CONTRAST WITH OLD JONATHAN BURGE WHO HELD HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND LEANED FORWARD COUGHING ASTHMATICALLY WITH AN INWARD SCORN OF ALL KNOWINGNESS THAT COULD NOT BE TURNED INTO CASH
THIS SENSE OF DIGNITY COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED EXCESSIVE IN A MAN WHO HAD BEEN BUTLER TO THE FAMILY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND WHO IN HIS PRESENT HIGH POSITION WAS NECESSARILY VERY MUCH IN CONTACT WITH HIS INFERIORS
IF I DON'T LIKE A MAN'S LOOKS DEPEND UPON IT I SHALL NEVER LIKE HIM
THAT IF YOU WOULD LOVE A WOMAN WITHOUT EVER LOOKING BACK ON YOUR LOVE AS A FOLLY SHE MUST DIE WHILE YOU ARE COURTING HER
AT ANOTHER TIME LISBETH'S FIRST THOUGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHERE IS ADAM BUT THE SUDDEN DEATH OF HER HUSBAND HAD RESTORED HIM IN THESE HOURS TO THAT FIRST PLACE IN HER AFFECTIONS WHICH HE HAD HELD SIX-AND-TWENTY YEARS AGO
SOON WARMTH AND WEARINESS LULLED HER IN THE MIDST OF HER SOBS AND SHE FELL CONTINUALLY INTO DOZING FANCYING HERSELF AT THE BRINK OF THE POOL AGAIN--FANCYING THAT SHE HAD JUMPED INTO THE WATER AND THEN AWAKING WITH A START AND WONDERING WHERE SHE WAS
BUT THEE'LT KNOW WHEN THEE GETS THY PARRIDGE BURNT AS IT'S LIKE ENOUGH TO BE WHEN I'N GI'EN O'ER MAKIN IT
I WAS THANKFUL FOR YOUR TIDINGS ABOUT THE DEAR FRIENDS AT THE HALL FARM FOR THOUGH I SENT THEM A LETTER BY MY AUNT'S DESIRE AFTER I CAME BACK FROM MY SOJOURN AMONG THEM I HAVE HAD NO WORD FROM THEM
WHAT A LOW PHASE OF LIFE
AND I TURNED THE LITTLE KNOBS AND THE LEGS AND CARVED TH OPEN WORK AFTER A PATTERN AS NICE AS COULD BE
SPEAK TO MY WARRING PASSIONS PEACE SAY TO MY TREMBLING HEART BE STILL THY POWER MY STRENGTH AND FORTRESS IS FOR ALL THINGS SERVE THY SOVEREIGN WILL
I'D HARD WORK T HOULD HER IN AN SHE MARRIED I SPITE O ME--A FELLER WI ON'Y TWO HEAD O STOCK WHEN THERE SHOULD HA BEEN TEN ON'S FARM--SHE MIGHT WELL DIE O TH INFLAMMATION AFORE SHE WAR THIRTY IT WAS SELDOM THE OLD MAN MADE SO LONG A SPEECH BUT HIS SON'S QUESTION HAD FALLEN LIKE A BIT OF DRY FUEL ON THE EMBERS OF A LONG UNEXTINGUISHED RESENTMENT WHICH HAD ALWAYS MADE THE GRANDFATHER MORE INDIFFERENT TO HETTY THAN TO HIS SON'S CHILDREN
HE KNEW THE OLD MAN WOULD BE IN A BETTER HUMOUR WHEN HE HAD HAD HIS SUPPER AND LIGHTED HIS PIPE
FOR REALLY SHE COULD NOT HAVE FELT MUCH SINCE SHE HAD SO SOON MADE UP HER MIND TO MARRY ADAM
BUT IF I SPEAK O THE WRONG OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE YOU'LL SEE I DIDN'T SPEAK TILL I'D GOOD REASON MR IRWINE NODDED SLOWLY AND ADAM WENT ON RATHER TREMULOUSLY YOU WAS T HA MARRIED ME AND HETTY SORREL YOU KNOW SIR O THE FIFTEENTH O THIS MONTH
THEY BOTH STARTED AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN SILENCE
AND YET SINCE HE WOULD NOT TELL THE POYSERS HIS CONVICTION AS TO WHERE HETTY WAS GONE OR HIS INTENTION TO FOLLOW HER THITHER HE MUST BE ABLE TO SAY TO THEM THAT HE HAD TRACED HER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
SHE'S GOT CLIVER FINGERS OF HER OWN AND CAN BE USEFUL ENOUGH WHEN SHE LIKES AND I SHOULD MISS HER WI THE BUTTER FOR SHE'S GOT A COOL HAND
GRAND MASSES OF CLOUD WERE HURRIED ACROSS THE BLUE AND THE GREAT ROUND HILLS BEHIND THE CHASE SEEMED ALIVE WITH THEIR FLYING SHADOWS
IT WAS THE LAST MORNING IN FEBRUARY WITH A LOW GREY SKY AND A SLIGHT HOAR-FROST ON THE GREEN BORDER OF THE ROAD AND ON THE BLACK HEDGES
THOUGH THE MOTHER'S A WHIMPERING THING--I DON'T LIKE TO COME WITHIN EARSHOT OF HER
WHEN SHE HAD PAID THE FARE FOR THE LAST COACH SHE HAD ONLY A SHILLING
ARTHUR WOULD SO GLADLY HAVE PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD DONE NO HARM
IT WAS SOILED WITH THE TREAD OF MUDDY SHOES AND UNTIDY WITH CLOTHES AND OTHER OBJECTS OUT OF PLACE
HE STOOD LIKE AN IMMOVABLE OBSTACLE AGAINST WHICH NO PRESSURE COULD AVAIL
THE FARMERS THOUGHT THE YOUNG SQUIRE KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY HATED THE OLD SQUIRE AND MRS POYSER SAID HE'D BETTER NOT HA STIRRED A KETTLE O SOUR BROTH THE BUCOLIC MIND DOES NOT READILY APPREHEND THE REFINEMENTS OF GOOD TASTE
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT SIR WELL SAID MR IRWINE RATHER HESITATINGLY THERE WOULD BE SOME REAL ADVANTAGES IN THAT...AND I HONOUR YOU FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS HIM BARTLE
BUT ADAM SCARCELY FELT THAT HE WAS WALKING
BUT SEE THERE'S THE SUNSHINE FALLING ON THE BOARD TO SHOW YOU MORE CLEARLY WHAT A FOOLISH MOVE YOU MADE WITH THAT PAWN
BUT NOW OWING TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THIS SOUND HER THOUGHTS BECAME CONCENTRATED ON HETTY--THAT SWEET YOUNG THING WITH LIFE AND ALL ITS TRIALS BEFORE HER--THE SOLEMN DAILY DUTIES OF THE WIFE AND MOTHER--AND HER MIND SO UNPREPARED FOR THEM ALL BENT MERELY ON LITTLE FOOLISH SELFISH PLEASURES LIKE A CHILD HUGGING ITS TOYS IN THE BEGINNING OF A LONG TOILSOME JOURNEY IN WHICH IT WILL HAVE TO BEAR HUNGER AND COLD AND UNSHELTERED DARKNESS
YOU MUST HAVE TIME--YOU MUST HAVE TIME
BUT THEN YOU SEE THEY WERE SO VERY DIFFERENT OUTSIDE
NAY SHE'LL SAY NOTHIN IT'S ON'Y THE MEN AS HAVE TO WAIT TILL FOLKS SAY THINGS AFORE THEY FIND EM OUT WELL BUT WHAT MAKES THEE THINK SO MOTHER
BUT IT STILL HAD THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING HER FROM ASKING HIM WHAT WERE THE PLACES ON THE ROAD TO WINDSOR
IT COULD ONLY BE ON A VERY CLEAR SHOWING THAT I COULD LEAVE THE BRETHREN AND SISTERS AT SNOWFIELD WHO ARE FAVOURED WITH VERY LITTLE OF THIS WORLD'S GOOD
TAKE MY ARM AGAIN ARTHUR MADE NO ANSWER AND PRESENTLY WALKED ON ADAM FOLLOWING
I'D AS LIEF LOOK AT A TOOAD
SHE'S GOING TO PUT THE IRONING THINGS AWAY MUNNY I TOULD IKE TO DO INTO DE BARN TO TOMMY TO SEE DE WHITTAWD NO NO NO
BUT SHE'S GOT A SPIRIT TO BEAR UP UNDER IT
THERE'S NOT MANY MORE CURRANTS TO GET SHE SAID
SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED
THEN HE TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE HOVEL BUT IT WAS NOT TILL HE GOT THERE THAT HE STOOD STILL AND TURNING HIS SHOULDER HALF-ROUND TOWARDS HER SAID AW I CAN SHOW YOU THE WAY TO NORTON IF YOU LIKE
LIKE THE LIFE IN SOME COAST TOWN THAT WAS ONCE A WATERING-PLACE AND IS NOW A PORT WHERE THE GENTEEL STREETS ARE SILENT AND GRASS-GROWN AND THE DOCKS AND WAREHOUSES BUSY AND RESONANT THE LIFE AT THE HALL HAS CHANGED ITS FOCUS AND NO LONGER RADIATES FROM THE PARLOUR BUT FROM THE KITCHEN AND THE FARMYARD
AYE AYE WE'RE COMING SETH ANSWERED FROM WITHIN AND PRESENTLY APPEARED STOOPING UNDER THE DOORWAY BEING TALLER THAN USUAL BY THE BLACK HEAD OF A STURDY TWO-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW WHO HAD CAUSED SOME DELAY BY DEMANDING TO BE CARRIED ON UNCLE'S SHOULDER
AN I'M SENSABLE AS YOU NOT LIVIN I THE PARISH THERE'S MORE UPO MY SHOULDERS TO BE SURE
HETTY GOT QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AND AT LAST WITH A FROWN AND POUT AND GATHERING TEARS SHE SAID OH DEAR AUNT I WISH YOU'D SPEAK TO TOTTY
AND NOTHING COULD BE AS IT HAD BEEN AGAIN
THERE WAS NO NEED TO CALL SETH FOR HE WAS ALREADY MOVING OVERHEAD AND PRESENTLY CAME DOWNSTAIRS
FOR MR CRAIG LIKE A SUPERIOR MAN WAS VERY FOND OF GIVING INFORMATION
BUT HOW WEARILY LONG IT WAS TO HETTY
THEY WERE AS FORMLESS AS THE SWEET LANGUID ODOURS OF THE GARDEN AT THE CHASE WHICH HAD FLOATED PAST HER AS SHE WALKED BY THE GATE
BUT MARTIN'S SURE TO BE IN AFORE LONG FOR THEY'RE LEAVING THE HAY COCKED TO-NIGHT READY FOR CARRYING FIRST THING TO-MORROW
A FAINT BLUSH DIED AWAY FROM HER PALE CHEEK AS SHE PUT HER HAND IN HIS AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TIMIDLY
THEY WANT SOMEBODY'S EYE ON EM CONSTANT IF THEY'RE TO BE KEPT TO THEIR WORK
THE FACE WORE ITS MILDEST EXPRESSION
I DONNA SEE HOW THEE'T TO KNOW AS TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW MEANS ALL THAT
TO DIE I THE COLD WATER AN US CLOSE TO HIM AN NE'ER TO KNOW
EVEN A DOG FEELS A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR PRESENCE
THEN A TRIPPING FIGURE WITH A ROUND HAT ON AND A SMALL BASKET UNDER HER ARM
THE LOW WESTERING SUN SHONE RIGHT ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE OLD BINTON HILLS TURNING THE UNCONSCIOUS SHEEP INTO BRIGHT SPOTS OF LIGHT
AND HAS HE ANY COMFORT FOR US WHEN WE ARE LAME AND SICK AND HELPLESS
I WANT YOU T HAVE YOUR TEA CHILD
THE AGED GROUP UNDER CARE OF SONS OR DAUGHTERS THEMSELVES WORN AND GREY PASSED ON ALONG THE LEAST-WINDING CARRIAGE-ROAD TOWARDS THE HOUSE WHERE A SPECIAL TABLE WAS PREPARED FOR THEM
IT'S A STORY GOT UP BECAUSE THE WOMEN ARE THERE AND SOMETHING MUST BE FOUND FOR EM TO DO
HE PLACED THEM ALL ON THE ROUND DEAL TABLE WHICH STOOD AGAINST HIS LARGE ARM-CHAIR IN THE CHIMNEY-CORNER WITH VIXEN'S HAMPER ON ONE SIDE OF IT AND A WINDOW-SHELF WITH A FEW BOOKS PILED UP IN IT ON THE OTHER
HIS UNIFORM WAS VERY ADVANTAGEOUS TO HIS FIGURE
I HEARD THE BABY CRYING AND THOUGHT THE OTHER FOLKS HEARD IT TOO--AND I WENT ON
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE REMEMBERED THAT MOMENT WHEN HE WAS CALMLY EXAMINING THE BEECH AS A MAN REMEMBERS HIS LAST GLIMPSE OF THE HOME WHERE HIS YOUTH WAS PASSED BEFORE THE ROAD TURNED AND HE SAW IT NO MORE
BUT ON THE OPPOSITE NORTHWESTERN SIDE THERE WAS NOTHING TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF GENTLY SWELLING MEADOW AND WOODED VALLEY AND DARK MASSES OF DISTANT HILL
THERE IS AN OLD SCHOOL-MASTER WITH HIM
MY THROAT'S TOO FULL TO SWALLOW VICTUALS WHY THEE CANSTNA GET THE COFFIN READY SAID LISBETH
NAY HIS LOVE FOR HER HAD GROWN OUT OF THAT PAST
IF WE'D GOT RID O THE SCANTLANDS WE SHOULD HAVE NO OUTLYING FIELDS
STUFF AND NONSENSE
STUFF AND NONSENSE
YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT WAS SUNDAY IF YOU HAD ONLY WAKED UP IN THE FARMYARD
BRIGHT ADMIRING GLANCES FROM A HANDSOME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WITH WHITE HANDS A GOLD CHAIN OCCASIONAL REGIMENTALS AND WEALTH AND GRANDEUR IMMEASURABLE--THOSE WERE THE WARM RAYS THAT SET POOR HETTY'S HEART VIBRATING AND PLAYING ITS LITTLE FOOLISH TUNES OVER AND OVER AGAIN
IT SMELLS VERY SWEET HE SAID
IT WAS HIS PAINFUL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WHICH HAD GIVEN THE MOST EXASPERATING STING TO ADAM'S REPROACHES
AFTER THE READING CLASS TWO YOUTHS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND NINETEEN CAME UP WITH THE IMAGINARY BILLS OF PARCELS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WRITING OUT ON THEIR SLATES AND WERE NOW REQUIRED TO CALCULATE OFF-HAND"--A TEST WHICH THEY STOOD WITH SUCH IMPERFECT SUCCESS THAT BARTLE MASSEY WHOSE EYES HAD BEEN GLARING AT THEM OMINOUSLY THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES FOR SOME MINUTES AT LENGTH BURST OUT IN A BITTER HIGH-PITCHED TONE PAUSING BETWEEN EVERY SENTENCE TO RAP THE FLOOR WITH A KNOBBED STICK WHICH RESTED BETWEEN HIS LEGS
SHE LOOKED FOR CONSOLATION AT HER FINE WHITE COTTON STOCKINGS
AND THERE WAS A FACE LOOKING DOWN ON HER
I SHALL LEARN TO LIKE IT AGAIN SOME TIME MAYBE
GOD ENTERS OUR SOULS THEN AND TEACHES US AND BRINGS US STRENGTH AND PEACE
IT WAS MR IRWINE THE CLERGYMAN TOLD ME AND MY AUNT WAS GRIEVED FOR YOUR MOTHER WHEN SHE HEARD IT AND WANTED ME TO COME
IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW LITTLE SHE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT WAITING ON HER UNCLE WHO HAD BEEN A GOOD FATHER TO HER--SHE HARDLY EVER REMEMBERED TO REACH HIM HIS PIPE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITHOUT BEING TOLD UNLESS A VISITOR HAPPENED TO BE THERE WHO WOULD HAVE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HER AS SHE WALKED ACROSS THE HEARTH
HE TURNED IT OVER ON HIS HAND AND SAW THE ENAMELLED GOLD BACK
BUT THEN AS THIS WAS THEIR USUAL MODE OF BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ALL MANKIND IT WOULD BE AN UNSAFE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD MORE THAN TRANSIENT FITS OF UNFRIENDLINESS
I'VE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO MY GRANDFATHER ONCE OR TWICE BUT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER HE HAS A DISLIKE TO ADAM AND I CAN DO NOTHING
SHE'S OWN NIECE TO POYSER'S WIFE AN THEY'LL BE FINE AN VEXED AT HER FOR MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF I THAT WAY
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THOSE TINY FELLOWS CARRYING THINGS FOUR TIMES AS BIG AS THEMSELVES NO SAID HETTY INDIFFERENTLY NOT CARING TO KNOW THE DIFFICULTIES OF ANT LIFE
FOR IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S THE SAME WITH LOVE AND HAPPINESS AS WITH SORROW--THE MORE WE KNOW OF IT THE BETTER WE CAN FEEL WHAT OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE OR MIGHT BE AND SO WE SHALL ONLY BE MORE TENDER TO EM AND WISHFUL TO HELP EM
THE COCKS AND HENS SEEMED TO KNOW IT AND MADE ONLY CROONING SUBDUED NOISES
THEY'LL MAKE GOOD MEAL BY AND BY BUT THEY'RE SQUASHY AS YET
AN WHAT AM I LIKE TO BE BUT KIND
IF YOU HAD A TABLE SPREAD FOR A FEAST AND WAS MAKING MERRY WITH YOUR FRIENDS YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS KIND TO LET ME COME AND SIT DOWN AND REJOICE WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'D THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SHARE THOSE GOOD THINGS
IF HE'S A MIND FOR HOT MEAT HIS WIFE LL MATCH IT WITH COLD BACON
WHEN I FIRST CAME I SAID IT WAS ONLY FOR A TIME AS LONG AS I COULD BE OF ANY COMFORT TO MY AUNT WELL AN WHO SAID YOU'D EVER LEFT OFF BEING A COMFORT TO ME SAID MRS POYSER
AND EVEN IF NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY MIGHT GET TOO FOND OF EACH OTHER AND THEN THERE COULD BE NOTHING BUT THE MISERY OF PARTING AFTER ALL
THEY SAT DOWN OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN THE OLD PLACES AND ARTHUR SAID I'M GOING AWAY ADAM
THE LIGHT GOT FAINTER AS THEY STOOD AND WHEN AT LAST THEY SAT DOWN ON THE STRAW PALLET TOGETHER THEIR FACES HAD BECOME INDISTINCT
YOU CAN USE YOUR RIGHT ARM QUITE WELL NOW ARTHUR MR IRWINE CONTINUED OBSERVING THAT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAD TAKEN HIS ARM OUT OF THE SLING
MR POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE-CORNERED CHAIR
ONE WITH A WILD HARD DESPAIR IN IT THE OTHER FULL OF SAD YEARNING LOVE
LET US GO UPSTAIRS
COME MY WENCH GIVE OVER CRYING AND GET TO BED
HE'S GOT BETTER NOTIONS O THINGS THAN MANY A MAN TWICE HIS AGE
IT WAS NOT VERY UNLIKE HIS DREAM FOR HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN LIVING THROUGH AGAIN IN A FEVERED DELIRIOUS WAY ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE DAYBREAK AND HIS MOTHER WITH HER FRETFUL GRIEF WAS PRESENT TO HIM THROUGH IT ALL
WHY I KNOW UPO GOOD AUTHORITY AS IT'S A BIG FRENCHMAN AS REACHES FIVE FOOT HIGH AN THEY LIVE UPO SPOON-MEAT MOSTLY
AS SHE SAT BY THE POOL AND SHUDDERED AT THE DARK COLD WATER THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE HER TENDERLY--THAT HE WOULD CARE FOR HER AND THINK FOR HER--WAS LIKE A SENSE OF LULLING WARMTH THAT MADE HER FOR THE MOMENT INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING ELSE
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS FATHER'S DYING IN THAT SAD WAY BUT JOSHUA RANN TELLS ME HE WANTED TO MARRY THAT SWEET LITTLE METHODIST PREACHER WHO WAS HERE ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND I SUPPOSE SHE REFUSED HIM AH I REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT HER
I'LL NE'ER REST I MY GRAVE IF I DONNA SEE THEE I THE CHURCHYARD OF A SUNDAY DONNA FEAR MOTHER SAID ADAM
PERHAPS IT STANDS IN THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN FIND IT NO I'VE PUT IT AWAY IN THE RIGHT-HAND PARLOUR
SHE HATES THE LEVERET THAT RUNS ACROSS THE PATH
I'D BE GLAD TO HA YE WI ME TO SPEAK TO I TH NIGHT FOR YE'VE GOT A NICE WAY O TALKIN IT PUTS ME I MIND O THE SWALLOWS AS WAS UNDER THE THACK LAST EAR WHEN THEY FUST BEGUN TO SING LOW AN SOFT-LIKE I TH MORNIN EH BUT MY OLD MAN WAR FOND O THEM BIRDS
SHE SAID SHE FELT QUITE STRONG ENOUGH
AND HETTY LOOKED AT HERSELF TO-NIGHT WITH QUITE A DIFFERENT SENSATION FROM WHAT SHE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE
NO I'VE NEVER SEEN HER CHILD--AT LEAST NOT AS SHE IS NOW SAID MRS IRWINE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT HETTY
TOTTY'S FACE WEARING AN UNUSUAL AIR OF ANXIETY AT THE IDEA OF SEEING COUSIN DINAH COME BACK LOOKING RATHER OLD FOR IN TOTTY'S EXPERIENCE NO MARRIED PEOPLE WERE YOUNG
AND THE SEVERE ADAM FELT NO MOVEMENT OF DISAPPROBATION
A HUNGRY LAND SAID ADAM TO HIMSELF
ON THE LARGE DEAL TABLE AGAINST THE WALL THERE WERE BRIGHT PEWTER PLATES AND SPOONS AND CANS READY FOR ALICK AND HIS COMPANIONS
HERE'S A HEALTH UNTO OUR MASTER THE FOUNDER OF THE FEAST
THE CHILD'S ALLAYS I MISCHIEF IF YOUR BACK'S TURNED A MINUTE
HER NEW SENSATIONS SEEMED TO EXCLUDE THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER GRIEF
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS GIVEN HER WHEN TO KEEP SILENCE AND WHEN TO SPEAK AND DO WE NOT ALL AGREE TO CALL RAPID THOUGHT AND NOBLE IMPULSE BY THE NAME OF INSPIRATION
IF EVER I LIVE TO BE A LARGE-ACRED MAN INSTEAD OF A POOR DEVIL WITH A MORTGAGED ALLOWANCE OF POCKET-MONEY I'LL HAVE ADAM FOR MY RIGHT HAND
I COULDN'T ABIDE THAT
YET HE WAS AWARE THAT COMMON AFFECTION AND FRIENDSHIP WERE MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM THAN THEY USED TO BE--THAT HE CLUNG MORE TO HIS MOTHER AND SETH AND HAD AN UNSPEAKABLE SATISFACTION IN THE SIGHT OR IMAGINATION OF ANY SMALL ADDITION TO THEIR HAPPINESS
AH BEN YOU'VE GOT A JOKE AGAIN ME AS LL LAST YOU YOUR LIFE
IF THERE'S ANY NEWS COME WE SHALL HEAR ABOUT IT THE PEOPLE WERE ASTIR ALREADY MOVING RAPIDLY IN ONE DIRECTION THROUGH THE STREETS
HE SLEPT LONG AND WELL
THE POOR DOG WAS HUNGRY AND RESTLESS BUT WOULD NOT LEAVE HIS MASTER AND WAS WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR SOME CHANGE IN THE SCENE
THERE SHE COMES
PAINT US YET OFTENER A MADONNA TURNING HER MILD FACE UPWARD AND OPENING HER ARMS TO WELCOME THE DIVINE GLORY
AND MR IRWINE'S SISTERS AS ANY PERSON OF FAMILY WITHIN TEN MILES OF BROXTON COULD HAVE TESTIFIED WERE SUCH STUPID UNINTERESTING WOMEN
I SPEAK PLAIN SIR BUT I CAN'T SPEAK ANY OTHER WAY
AN EMBODIMENT OF WHAT ARTHUR MOST SHRANK FROM BELIEVING IN--THE IRREVOCABLENESS OF HIS OWN WRONGDOING
ADD ONE FOOL TO ANOTHER FOOL AND IN SIX YEARS TIME SIX FOOLS MORE--THEY'RE ALL OF THE SAME DENOMINATION BIG AND LITTLE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SUM DURING THIS RATHER HEATED EXHORTATION TO COOLNESS AND DISCRETION THE PIPE HAD GONE OUT AND BARTLE GAVE THE CLIMAX TO HIS SPEECH BY STRIKING A LIGHT FURIOUSLY AFTER WHICH HE PUFFED WITH FIERCE RESOLUTION FIXING HIS EYE STILL ON ADAM WHO WAS TRYING NOT TO LAUGH
SHE SET OUT WALKING AGAIN
THE VERY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER OWN LIMBS WAS A DELIGHT TO HER
HE THREW HIMSELF ON THE BENCH AND STARED DULLY AT THE WOOD AND THE SIGNS OF WORK AROUND HIM WONDERING IF HE SHOULD EVER COME TO FEEL PLEASURE IN THEM AGAIN WHILE GYP DIMLY AWARE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIS MASTER LAID HIS ROUGH GREY HEAD ON ADAM'S KNEE AND WRINKLED HIS BROWS TO LOOK UP AT HIM
YOU'D FOLLOW YOUR CONSCIENCE AS MUCH AS YOU DO NOW YES ADAM DINAH SAID I KNOW MARRIAGE IS A HOLY STATE FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRULY CALLED TO IT AND HAVE NO OTHER DRAWING
THE JUDGE HAD ADDRESSED THE JURY AND THEY WERE RETIRING
I WISH YOU SUCCESS FAREWELL SIR
SHE CALLS ME HER BROTHER AND THAT'S ENOUGH BUT DOST THINK SHE MIGHT EVER GET FOND ENOUGH OF ANYBODY ELSE TO BE WILLING TO MARRY EM SAID ADAM RATHER SHYLY
I WOULDN'T VEX YOU FOR THE WORLD YOU LITTLE BLOSSOM
HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN OTHER BEAUTIES IN THE LANDSCAPE IF HE HAD TURNED A LITTLE IN HIS SADDLE AND LOOKED EASTWARD BEYOND JONATHAN BURGE'S PASTURE AND WOODYARD TOWARDS THE GREEN CORN-FIELDS AND WALNUT-TREES OF THE HALL FARM
THERE WERE THE SYRINGAS AND GUELDER ROSES ALL LARGE AND DISORDERLY FOR WANT OF TRIMMING
SHE HAD HER HAND ON THE RED-LEATHER CASE WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THIS CASE WHICH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN--SOMETHING WORTH SELLING
THE PARTING WITH ARTHUR WAS A DOUBLE PAIN TO HER--MINGLING WITH THE TUMULT OF PASSION AND VANITY THERE WAS A DIM UNDEFINED FEAR THAT THE FUTURE MIGHT SHAPE ITSELF IN SOME WAY QUITE UNLIKE HER DREAM
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THIS WAY OF COMING TO THE CHASE HE SAID AT LAST LOOKING DOWN AT HETTY
AND THEN THE QUIET RISING THE MOTHERS TYING ON THE BONNETS OF THE LITTLE MAIDENS WHO HAD SLEPT THROUGH THE SERMON THE FATHERS COLLECTING THE PRAYER-BOOKS UNTIL ALL STREAMED OUT THROUGH THE OLD ARCHWAY INTO THE GREEN CHURCHYARD AND BEGAN THEIR NEIGHBOURLY TALK THEIR SIMPLE CIVILITIES AND THEIR INVITATIONS TO TEA
WHY I SAW HIM MYSELF LAST MARKET-DAY A-CARRYING A BASKET WI ORANGES IN'T AH TO BE SURE SAID MRS POYSER EMPHATICALLY YOU MAKE BUT A POOR TRAP TO CATCH LUCK IF YOU GO AND BAIT IT WI WICKEDNESS
YOU WILL BE EXPECTED AT THE HOUSE
I'D SOONER MAKE A SHIFT AN GET INTO MY OWN COFFIN AFORE I DIE NOR HA THEM FOLKS TO PUT ME IN ADAM WAS SILENT AND TRIED TO GO ON READING
OH HOW DREARY IT WAS--THE THOUGHT OF GOING OUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE WOOD INTO THE UNSHELTERED ROAD WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIM
I'M AFRAID THE DRINK HELPED THE BROOK TO DROWN HIM
AND NOW THE MUSIC STRUCK UP AND THE GLORIOUS COUNTRY-DANCE BEST OF ALL DANCES BEGAN
HERS WAS A LUXURIOUS AND VAIN NATURE--NOT A PASSIONATE ONE--AND IF SHE WERE EVER TO TAKE ANY VIOLENT MEASURE SHE MUST BE URGED TO IT BY THE DESPERATION OF TERROR
WHY THERE HE COMES OUT O WILL MASKERY'S
I SEEM TO HAVE NO ROOM IN MY SOUL FOR WANTS AND FEARS OF MY OWN IT HAS PLEASED GOD TO FILL MY HEART SO FULL WITH THE WANTS AND SUFFERINGS OF HIS POOR PEOPLE SETH WAS UNABLE TO REPLY AND THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE
I COULDN'T HAVE MADE YOU FEEL MY LOVE
THEN YOU WILL BEGIN TO FEEL THAT YOUR SOUL IS NOT SAVED
BUT SO DOES EVERY SIN CAUSE SUFFERING TO OTHERS BESIDES THOSE WHO COMMIT IT
BUT HE STOOD STILL IN THE DOORWAY SMITTEN WITH A SUDDEN SHOCK AT THE SIGHT OF ADAM SEATED LISTLESSLY ON THE BENCH PALE UNWASHED WITH SUNKEN BLANK EYES ALMOST LIKE A DRUNKARD IN THE MORNING
IS THERE ANY BAD NEWS
WE SHOULD HA BEEN ILL OFF WI'OUT HER LADY DAY WAS A TWELVEMONT WE MUN BE THANKFUL FOR THAT WHETHER SHE STAYS OR NO
THE DOCTOR HAD TOLD HER AUNT ALL ABOUT IT IN HETTY'S HEARING
I BESEECH YOU TO GET LEAVE FOR ME TO BE WITH HER WHAT
AH POOR BLIND CHILD DINAH WENT ON THINK IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU AS IT ONCE HAPPENED TO A SERVANT OF GOD IN THE DAYS OF HER VANITY
HIS MENTAL PALATE INDEED WAS RATHER PAGAN AND FOUND A SAVOURINESS IN A QUOTATION FROM SOPHOCLES OR THEOCRITUS THAT WAS QUITE ABSENT FROM ANY TEXT IN ISAIAH OR AMOS
TO BE SURE CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE LOVED HER SO THAT HE WOULD NEVER CARE ABOUT LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE BUT THEN THOSE OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW HOW HE LOVED HER AND SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED TO APPEAR SHABBY AND INSIGNIFICANT IN THEIR EYES EVEN FOR A SHORT SPACE
HE WONDERED IF THE DEAR LITTLE THING WERE THINKING OF HIM TOO--TWENTY TO ONE SHE WAS
I FELT WHAT POOR EMPTY WORK IT WAS AS SOON AS I'D DONE IT BEFORE I BEGAN TO THINK HE MIGHT BE DEAD IN THIS WAY IT HAPPENED THAT ARTHUR AND ADAM WERE WALKING TOWARDS THE SAME SPOT AT THE SAME TIME
AND SHE MUST PUT ON HER BROWN BERRIES--HER NECK WOULD LOOK SO UNFINISHED WITHOUT IT
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A HARD STRUGGLE WITH HIS MOTHER HE KNEW
IF KING GEORGE UD TURN EM ALL AWAY AND GOVERN BY HIMSELF HE'D SEE EVERYTHING RIGHTED
IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER SUNSET
AND THEY ARE THE PRETTIEST ATTITUDES AND MOVEMENTS INTO WHICH A PRETTY GIRL IS THROWN IN MAKING UP BUTTER--TOSSING MOVEMENTS THAT GIVE A CHARMING CURVE TO THE ARM AND A SIDEWARD INCLINATION OF THE ROUND WHITE NECK
IT WAS OWING TO THIS FEELING ON GYP'S PART THAT WHEN LISBETH CAME INTO THE WORKSHOP AND ADVANCED TOWARDS ADAM AS NOISELESSLY AS SHE COULD HER INTENTION NOT TO AWAKEN HIM WAS IMMEDIATELY DEFEATED
HAPPEN THE CAPTAIN ULL COME HOME AND MAKE OUR PEACE WI TH OLD SQUIRE
MOREOVER SHE HAD ALWAYS A BETTER DINNER THAN USUAL TO PREPARE FOR HER SONS--VERY FREQUENTLY FOR ADAM AND HERSELF ALONE SETH BEING OFTEN AWAY THE ENTIRE DAY--AND THE SMELL OF THE ROAST MEAT BEFORE THE CLEAR FIRE IN THE CLEAN KITCHEN THE CLOCK TICKING IN A PEACEFUL SUNDAY MANNER HER DARLING ADAM SEATED NEAR HER IN HIS BEST CLOTHES DOING NOTHING VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT SHE COULD GO AND STROKE HER HAND ACROSS HIS HAIR IF SHE LIKED AND SEE HIM LOOK UP AT HER AND SMILE WHILE GYP RATHER JEALOUS POKED HIS MUZZLE UP BETWEEN THEM--ALL THESE THINGS MADE POOR LISBETH'S EARTHLY PARADISE
SO HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TENDING THE BACK KITCHEN FIRE AND FOLDING UP HIS FATHER'S CLOTHES WHICH HAD BEEN HANGING OUT TO DRY SINCE MORNING--AFRAID TO MOVE ABOUT IN THE ROOM WHERE HIS MOTHER WAS LEST HE SHOULD IRRITATE HER FURTHER
IS THERE ANYTHING HAPPENED YES SAID ADAM HEAVILY
MR BEDE I'M SORRY YOU'VE TO WAIT SO LONG FOR YOUR ALE BUT IT'S COMING IN A MINUTE
DOOD-BYE DANDAD SAID TOTTY
NO WONDER THE PATIENT BEASTS RAN CONFUSEDLY INTO THE WRONG PLACES FOR THE ALARMING DIN OF THE BULL-DOG WAS MINGLED WITH MORE DISTANT SOUNDS WHICH THE TIMID FEMININE CREATURES WITH PARDONABLE SUPERSTITION IMAGINED ALSO TO HAVE SOME RELATION TO THEIR OWN MOVEMENTS--WITH THE TREMENDOUS CRACK OF THE WAGGONER'S WHIP THE ROAR OF HIS VOICE AND THE BOOMING THUNDER OF THE WAGGON AS IT LEFT THE RICK-YARD EMPTY OF ITS GOLDEN LOAD
THE PARSONAGE HERE'S A TUMBLE-DOWN PLACE SIR NOT FIT FOR GENTRY TO LIVE IN
THE YARD WAS FULL OF LIFE NOW
SHE SET HER TEETH WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF ARTHUR
THEY TOO LIKE HETTY HAD LINGERED A LITTLE IN THEIR WALK FOR DINAH WAS TRYING TO SPEAK WORDS OF COMFORT AND STRENGTH TO SETH IN THESE PARTING MOMENTS
I BELIEVE--I BELIEVE IN THY INFINITE LOVE
BUT LISBETH HAD GONE TOO FAR NOW TO CHECK HERSELF AND AFTER SCARCELY A MINUTE'S QUIETNESS SHE BEGAN AGAIN
YOU PICK THE THINGS FOR WHAT THEY CAN EXCEL IN--FOR WHAT THEY CAN EXCEL IN
IT COULDN'T HA BEEN AND NONE OF US KNOW IT TERRIBLE PROOF THAT SHE WAS UNDER THE TEMPTATION TO COMMIT THE CRIME
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING HOME TO HER FRIENDS
ON A FRONT VIEW IT APPEARED TO CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF TWO SPHERES BEARING ABOUT THE SAME RELATION TO EACH OTHER AS THE EARTH AND THE MOON
SHE BEGAN TO TALK OF YOU THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY ENTERED THE COTTAGE LISBETH WAS SEATED IN HER ARM-CHAIR TOO TIRED WITH SETTING OUT THE EVENING MEAL A TASK SHE ALWAYS PERFORMED A LONG TIME BEFOREHAND TO GO AND MEET THEM AT THE DOOR AS USUAL WHEN SHE HEARD THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
HE WAS VERY FRIENDLY TO ME
BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A MAN'S HEART AND SOUL IN YOU YOU CAN'T BE EASY A-MAKING YOUR OWN BED AN LEAVING THE REST TO LIE ON THE STONES
I ALWAYS LIKE TO HEAR WHAT MR RANN HAS GOT TO SAY
BUT THAT BONNY-CHEEKED LASS WAS BLESSED WITH AN ELASTICITY OF SPIRITS THAT SECURED HER FROM ANY RANKLING GRIEF
WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE ENTERED WITH MR IRWINE BY HIS SIDE EVERY ONE STOOD UP AND THIS MOMENT OF HOMAGE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO ARTHUR
THE MORE THERE WAS SAID ABOUT HER HUSBAND THE MORE THERE WAS DONE FOR HIM SURELY THE SAFER HE WOULD BE
THERE'S NOTHING BUT WHAT'S BEARABLE AS LONG AS A MAN CAN WORK HE SAID TO HIMSELF
ANYHOW YOU'D BEST GO T ASHBY NEXT--THAT'S SOUTH'ARD
BUT I CANNA THINK WHAT SHE MUN LEAVE A GOOD HOME FOR TO GO BACK INT A COUNTRY WHERE THE LAND MOST ON'T ISNA WORTH TEN SHILLINGS AN ACRE RENT AND PROFITS WHY THAT'S JUST THE REASON SHE WANTS TO GO AS FUR AS SHE CAN GIVE A REASON SAID MRS POYSER
THERE WAS LESS DUST THAN USUAL ON THE DARK-GREEN HEDGE-ROWS AND ON THE WILD CAMOMILE THAT STARRED THE ROADSIDE YET THE GRASS WAS DRY ENOUGH FOR THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO ROLL ON IT AND THERE WAS NO CLOUD BUT A LONG DASH OF LIGHT DOWNY RIPPLE HIGH HIGH UP IN THE FAR-OFF BLUE SKY
THE FACT IS I'M VERY MUCH IN THE SAME CONDITION AS YOU JUST NOW
HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL-ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
EVEN IN THE MOMENTS WHEN SHE WAS MOST THOROUGHLY CONSCIOUS OF HIS SUPERIORITY TO HER OTHER ADMIRERS SHE HAD NEVER BROUGHT HERSELF TO THINK OF ACCEPTING HIM
POOR GIRL SAID ARTHUR
HE STOOD LEANING ON A PLANK HE HAD TAKEN HOLD OF LISTENING TO SOUNDS WHICH HIS IMAGINATION INTERPRETED FOR HIM SO PLEASANTLY THAT THE KEEN STRONG FACE BECAME SUFFUSED WITH A TIMID TENDERNESS
I ONLY WORKED AT IT IN OVERHOURS--OFTEN LATE AT NIGHT--AND I HAD TO GO TO TREDDLESTON OVER AN OVER AGAIN ABOUT LITTLE BITS O BRASS NAILS AND SUCH GEAR
IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANYTHING ASK THE JAILER FOR MY ADDRESS AND COME TO ME
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF HE HAD ALWAYS BEFORE THOUGHT IT A LIGHT THING THAT MEN SHOULD SUFFER AS IF ALL THAT HE HAD HIMSELF ENDURED AND CALLED SORROW BEFORE WAS ONLY A MOMENT'S STROKE THAT HAD NEVER LEFT A BRUISE
HE WAS THINKING EAGERLY WHERE HE COULD INQUIRE ABOUT HETTY
NOW MOTHER DON'T CRY AND TALK SO
BUT IF I'D SAID YOU'D LOOK PRETTY IN EM I SHOULD HA SAID NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS TRUE WHY THEE THOUGHT'ST HETTY WAR A GHOST DIDSTNA SAID MR POYSER TO HIS WIFE WHO NOW CAME BACK AND TOOK HER SEAT AGAIN
YOU ARE ONLY A VISITOR IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I THINK WERE HIS FIRST WORDS AS HE SEATED HIMSELF OPPOSITE TO HER
WELL-LOOKING INDEED
IT WAS AS IF DINAH HAD PUT HER HANDS UNAWARES ON A VIBRATING CHORD
BUT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GREETING ADAM DREW HIM INTO THE WORKSHOP TO CONSULT ABOUT THE COFFIN AND DINAH WENT ON WITH HER CLEANING
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE AND NEED A FRIEND THAT WILL ALWAYS FEEL FOR YOU AND LOVE YOU YOU HAVE GOT THAT FRIEND IN DINAH MORRIS AT SNOWFIELD AND IF YOU COME TO HER OR SEND FOR HER SHE'LL NEVER FORGET THIS NIGHT AND THE WORDS SHE IS SPEAKING TO YOU NOW
HE WAS AS NAUGHTY AS COULD BE AT THE BEGINNING WHILE I WAS PRAYING AND WHILE WE WAS SINGING BUT WHEN WE ALL SAT DOWN AND DINAH BEGAN TO SPEAK TH YOUNG UN STOOD STOCK STILL ALL AT ONCE AND BEGAN TO LOOK AT HER WITH'S MOUTH OPEN AND PRESENTLY HE RAN AWAY FROM'S MOTHER AND WENT TO DINAH AND PULLED AT HER LIKE A LITTLE DOG FOR HER TO TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE--TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND--SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME--I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM ADAM'S HEAD WAS HANGING DOWN AGAIN AND HE DID NOT SPEAK
SHE WAS THE LAST PERSON LIKELY TO BE IN THE HOUSE
NO SOONER WERE THE LITTLE FAT LEGS PUSHED DOWN THAN UP THEY CAME AGAIN FOR TOTTY'S EYES WERE TOO BUSY IN STARING AT THE LARGE DISHES TO SEE WHERE THE PLUM PUDDING WAS FOR HER TO RETAIN ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER LEGS
IT MUST BE AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAD SET HER HEART ON ADAM AT LAST AND HER SUDDEN FREAK OF WANTING TO BE A LADY'S MAID MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOME LITTLE PIQUE OR MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM WHICH HAD PASSED BY
NO YOUNG MAN COULD CONFESS HIS FAULTS MORE CANDIDLY
HOW SHOULD I HEAR ANYTHING WAS THE ANSWER IN A PETTISH TONE
THAT WAS THE ONE SHARP POINT WHICH PRESSED AGAINST HIM
BUT IN THIS SOBER LIGHT THE DELICATE COLOURING OF HER FACE SEEMED TO GATHER A CALM VIVIDNESS LIKE FLOWERS AT EVENING
NOW YOU TAKE SOME NERVED BY AN ACTIVE RESOLUTION ADAM TOOK A MORSEL OF BREAD AND DRANK SOME WINE
I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO SET MY FACE TOWARDS THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY'RE RICH IN CORN AND CATTLE AND THE GROUND SO LEVEL AND EASY TO TREAD
AND WIRY BEN WONDERED HOW SETH HAD THE PLUCK TO THINK OF COURTING HER
HE WAS DISTRESSED FOR HETTY'S SAKE AND DISTRESSED FOR HIS OWN THAT HE MUST LEAVE HER BEHIND
NO HOUSE WAS EMPTY EXCEPT THE ONE NEXT TO WILL MASKERY'S IN THE VILLAGE AND THAT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ADAM NOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR ONE'S GOOD ALL ROUND I THE LONG RUN
SETH'S CHIEF FEELING WAS AWE AND DISTRESS AT THIS SUDDEN SNATCHING AWAY OF HIS FATHER'S SOUL
BUT I SUPPOSE IT DOESNA MATTER SO MUCH ABOUT FOLKS'S SOULS I THIS COUNTRY ELSE YOU'D BE FOR STAYING WITH YOUR OWN AUNT FOR SHE'S NONE SO GOOD BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT HELP HER TO BE BETTER THERE WAS A CERTAIN SOMETHING IN MRS POYSER'S VOICE JUST THEN WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH TO BE NOTICED SO SHE TURNED ROUND HASTILY TO LOOK AT THE CLOCK AND SAID
BUT HE DECLARED AS THE PEOPLE HAD DONE AT THE INN THAT HE HAD LOST SIGHT OF HETTY DIRECTLY SHE GOT DOWN
IT WOULD NOT DO FOR HIM TO DANCE WITH NO ONE BESIDES HETTY
A MAN MAY BE VERY FIRM IN OTHER MATTERS AND YET BE UNDER A SORT OF WITCHERY FROM A WOMAN YES
HE LOVED HER THE BETTER BECAUSE SHE KNEW NOTHING OF HIS SECRETS
IT WAS A SOLEMN MINOR STRAIN THEY SANG
WELL ADAM SAID ARTHUR YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE FINE OLD BEECHES EH
DESPAIR NO MORE LEANS ON OTHERS THAN PERFECT CONTENTMENT AND IN DESPAIR PRIDE CEASES TO BE COUNTERACTED BY THE SENSE OF DEPENDENCE
I AM PERSUADED THAT THIS WILL BE A SHOCK OF WHICH HE WILL FEEL THE EFFECTS ALL HIS LIFE
HETTY COULD NOT BE GUILTY OF THE CRIME--HER HEART MUST HAVE CLUNG TO HER BABY--ELSE WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE TAKEN IT WITH HER
THERE'S BEEN ILL-LOOKING TRAMPS ENOO ABOUT THE PLACE THIS LAST WEEK TO CARRY OFF EVERY HAM AN EVERY SPOON WE'N GOT
HE JUST PRESSED HER HAND AND SAID WITH A LOOK AND TONE THAT WERE ALMOST CHILLING TO HER I HAVE BEEN HINDERING YOU
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A WALK IN THE CHASE SOMETIMES NOW IT'S SO GREEN AND PLEASANT
HE FELT SURE HE SHOULD SOME DAY IF HE LIVED BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A FAMILY AND MAKE A GOOD BROAD PATH FOR HIMSELF
THEY'RE MY BROTHER'S
SO THERE IS SAID DINAH
HE FELT SURE SHE WAS A DEAR AFFECTIONATE GOOD LITTLE THING
SHE WISHES YOU WELL
AND HIS GLANCE INSTEAD OF BEING KEEN IS CONFIDING AND BENIGN
BUT THERE AT THE CORNER OF THIS PASTURE THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE HEDGES
AFTER ALL HE MIGHT BE A FOOL MAKING A GREAT MISERY OUT OF A TRIFLE
BUT I'LL NIVER GIVE IN AS THAT'S CAUSE SHE'S A METHODIST NO MORE NOR A WHITE CALF'S WHITE CAUSE IT EATS OUT O THE SAME BUCKET WI A BLACK UN NAY SAID MR POYSER WITH AS NEAR AN APPROACH TO A SNARL AS HIS GOOD-NATURE WOULD ALLOW
HAS HE ACCEPTED THE POST
BUT I MUST GET BACK NOW FOR THIS ROAD IS CONFOUNDEDLY DAMP
WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO LAY OUR NATURAL LAWFUL AFFECTIONS ON THE ALTAR ADAM DARED NOT PLEAD AGAIN FOR DINAH'S WAS NOT THE VOICE OF CAPRICE OR INSINCERITY
IT MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRESS THAT OLD LADY IN THE MORNING
SHE IS CLEARLY ONE OF THOSE CHILDREN OF ROYALTY WHO HAVE NEVER DOUBTED THEIR RIGHT DIVINE AND NEVER MET WITH ANY ONE SO ABSURD AS TO QUESTION IT
HE WOULD RIDE TO BROXTON RECTORY THE FIRST THING AFTER BREAKFAST TO-MORROW
ADAM AN SETH'S TWO MEN
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME HE HAD SEEN HER
I KNOW YOU CAN NEVER BE HAPPY EXCEPT BY MARRYING A MAN IN YOUR OWN STATION
NO SCENE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PEACEFUL IF MRS POYSER WHO WAS IRONING A FEW THINGS THAT STILL REMAINED FROM THE MONDAY'S WASH HAD NOT BEEN MAKING A FREQUENT CLINKING WITH HER IRON AND MOVING TO AND FRO WHENEVER SHE WANTED IT TO COOL
SHE TOOK UP HER BASKET AND WALKED ACROSS THE FIELD BUT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE GOT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THE STILE
DEAL WITH THEM ACCORDING TO THE FREE MERCY WHICH THOU DIDST SHOW TO HER
TH OLD SQUIRE LOOKED UP AT THIS AND PEERED IN HIS WAY AT THE SCREEN AND SAID ONE POUND THIRTEEN FOR A GIMCRACK LIKE THAT
AYE YOU'RE I THE RIGHT NOT
WILL HE BE BACK TO DINNER AYE LAD HE'LL BE BACK FOR A WONDER
SHE WAS LIKE A KITTEN AND HAD THE SAME DISTRACTINGLY PRETTY LOOKS THAT MEANT NOTHING FOR EVERYBODY THAT CAME NEAR HER
THEY ARE BUT DIM ILL-DEFINED PICTURES THAT HER NARROW BIT OF AN IMAGINATION CAN MAKE OF THE FUTURE
ASK YOURSELF ONCE MORE WHETHER YOU ARE NOT TAKING A MEASURE WHICH MAY PAIN HER MORE THAN MERE SILENCE
BUT I SHOULD LIKE T HAVE MY OWN WAY ABOUT THINGS--I COULD TRY PLANS THEN AS I CAN'T DO NOW YOU GET ON PRETTY WELL WI THE NEW STEWARD I RECKON SAID MR POYSER
HIS SUFFERING COULD NOT BE CANCELLED
HOW COULD HE HELP FEELING IT
A SATISFACTORY BAILIFF IS HARD TO FIND
SHE WAITED FOR IT THINKING THAT IF THE WAGGONER WERE NOT A VERY SOUR-LOOKING MAN SHE WOULD ASK HIM TO TAKE HER UP
IT'S JUST THE SAME BACK ONLY BROADER AS WHEN YOU USED TO CARRY ME ON IT
BUT LET US SEE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT JESUS CAME ON EARTH FOR
TO HAVE SOME LARGE BEAUTIFUL EAR-RINGS SUCH AS WERE ALL THE FASHION
BUT HE CONSIDERED HIS RESOLUTION SUFFICIENTLY FIXED
NEVERTHELESS THE UPPER SERVANTS WHO HAD BEEN ON TERMS OF NEIGHBOURLY INTERCOURSE WITH THE POYSERS FOR MANY YEARS COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT THE LONGED-FOR EVENT OF THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S COMING INTO THE ESTATE HAD BEEN ROBBED OF ALL ITS PLEASANTNESS
DELICIOUS SENSATION
VIXEN HAD BEGUN TO WHIMPER AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF A STICK AND A LAME WALK ON THE STAIRS
HE HAD HAD AN IRRATIONAL HOPE THAT HETTY MIGHT BE THERE
THE WORDS OF SCORN THE REFUSAL TO SHAKE HANDS THE MASTERY ASSERTED OVER HIM IN THEIR LAST CONVERSATION IN THE HERMITAGE--ABOVE ALL THE SENSE OF HAVING BEEN KNOCKED DOWN TO WHICH A MAN DOES NOT VERY WELL RECONCILE HIMSELF EVEN UNDER THE MOST HEROIC CIRCUMSTANCES--PRESSED ON HIM WITH A GALLING PAIN WHICH WAS STRONGER THAN COMPUNCTION
YOU LOOK TH IMAGE O YOUR AUNT JUDITH DINAH WHEN YOU SIT A-SEWING
IT'S LIKE HAVING ROAST MEAT AT THREE FIRES
SHE TOOK OUT HER MONEY FROM HER PURSE AND LOOKED AT IT
SHE CLASPS HER HANDS ROUND HER KNEES AND LEANS FORWARD AND LOOKS EARNESTLY AT IT AS IF TRYING TO GUESS WHAT SORT OF BED IT WOULD MAKE FOR HER YOUNG ROUND LIMBS
ADAM WHO HAD SAT UP LATE AT HIS WRITING WAS STILL ASLEEP AND WAS NOT LIKELY SETH SAID TO BE DOWN TILL BREAKFAST-TIME
HE ALWAYS CALLED VIXEN A WOMAN AND SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ALL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HE WAS USING A FIGURE OF SPEECH
BUT YOU WON'T STAY MUCH BEYOND A WEEK--THE TIME ULL SEEM LONG HE WAS LOOKING AT HER FONDLY AND HIS STRONG HAND HELD HERS IN ITS GRASP
THEY LEARNED A GREAT MANY NOTIONS ABOUT DOCTRINE FROM HIM SO THAT ALMOST EVERY CHURCH-GOER UNDER FIFTY BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH AS WELL BETWEEN THE GENUINE GOSPEL AND WHAT DID NOT COME PRECISELY UP TO THAT STANDARD AS IF HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED A DISSENTER
AND SINCE ADAM DID NOT WANT TO MARRY DINAH HIMSELF LISBETH FELT RATHER PEEVISH ON THAT SCORE--AS PEEVISH AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD WANTED TO MARRY HER AND SO SHUT HIMSELF OUT FROM MARY BURGE AND THE PARTNERSHIP AS EFFECTUALLY AS BY MARRYING HETTY
THERE WAS A MINGLED RUSTLING WHISPERING AND LOW BUZZING THROUGHOUT THE COURT DURING THIS INTERVAL
AS FOR HETTY HER FEET RESTED ON A CLOUD AND SHE WAS BORNE ALONG BY WARM ZEPHYRS
IT WAS PARTLY THINKING O YOU MADE ME COME TOWARD STONITON
THAT WOULD NOT BE FAIR-PLAY
AND HE LIKES THE NEEDLES GOD HELP HIM
LISBETH HAD BEEN ROCKING HERSELF IN THIS WAY FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES GIVING A LOW MOAN WITH EVERY FORWARD MOVEMENT OF HER BODY WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FELT A HAND PLACED GENTLY ON HERS AND A SWEET TREBLE VOICE SAID TO HER DEAR SISTER THE LORD HAS SENT ME TO SEE IF I CAN BE A COMFORT TO YOU LISBETH PAUSED IN A LISTENING ATTITUDE WITHOUT REMOVING HER APRON FROM HER FACE
AN HERE I'M HAVING LINEN SPUN AN THINKING ALL THE WHILE IT'LL MAKE SHEETING AND TABLE-CLOTHING FOR HER WHEN SHE'S MARRIED AN SHE'LL LIVE I THE PARISH WI US AND NEVER GO OUT OF OUR SIGHTS--LIKE A FOOL AS I AM FOR THINKING AUGHT ABOUT HER AS IS NO BETTER NOR A CHERRY WI A HARD STONE INSIDE IT NAY NAY THEE MUSTNA MAKE MUCH OF A TRIFLE SAID MR POYSER SOOTHINGLY
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO EAGLEDALE SHE SAID AS THEY WALKED SLOWLY ALONG
IT UD HA LED TO NO HAPPINESS I TH END HETTY SAID NOTHING
BUT NO SADNESS IN THE PROSPECT OF HER GOING AWAY--IN THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ISSUE--COULD ROB THE SWEETNESS FROM ADAM'S SENSE THAT DINAH LOVED HIM
AND UNTIL IT CAN BE PROVED THAT HATRED IS A BETTER THING FOR THE SOUL THAN LOVE I MUST BELIEVE THAT MR IRWINE'S INFLUENCE IN HIS PARISH WAS A MORE WHOLESOME ONE THAN THAT OF THE ZEALOUS MR RYDE WHO CAME THERE TWENTY YEARS AFTERWARDS WHEN MR IRWINE HAD BEEN GATHERED TO HIS FATHERS
BUT THIS LITTLE FLASH OF TEMPER DID WHAT THE SALTS COULD NOT HAVE DONE--IT ROUSED HER TO WIPE AWAY THE TRACES OF HER TEARS AND TRY WITH ALL HER MIGHT NOT TO SHED ANY MORE
BUT WHAT DID MR IRWINE SAY TO YOU ABOUT THAT FOOL'S TRICK O PREACHING ON THE GREEN HE ONLY SAID HE'D HEARD OF IT
SHE WAS LOOKING ON THE GROUND BUT ADAM SAW HER FACE SAW THE TEARS AND BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED SAYING HETTY DEAR HETTY WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR HIS EAGER RAPID THOUGHT HAD FLOWN THROUGH ALL THE CAUSES CONCEIVABLE TO HIM AND HAD AT LAST ALIGHTED ON HALF THE TRUE ONE
ADAM THEN WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOUSE FROM WHICH THE STONITION COACH STARTED
NO SIR--AN YET AS I MAY SAY IT IS THIEVES AN A-THIEVIN THE CHURCH TOO
THAT'S THE LAST WORD I'VE GOT TO SAY TO YOU WITH THIS FINAL SENTENCE BARTLE MASSEY GAVE A SHARPER RAP THAN EVER WITH HIS KNOBBED STICK AND THE DISCOMFITED LADS GOT UP TO GO WITH A SULKY LOOK
AND THE GREY-HAIRED FATHER OF WHOM HE HAD THOUGHT WITH A SORT OF HARDNESS A FEW HOURS AGO AS CERTAIN TO LIVE TO BE A THORN IN HIS SIDE WAS PERHAPS EVEN THEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT WATERY DEATH
WHERE SHOULD SHE GO
THE BUTLER HURRIED OUT AFTER HIM AS FAST AS HIS ELDERLY LIMBS COULD RUN
PRAYER MAYNA BRING MONEY BUT IT BRINGS US WHAT NO MONEY CAN BUY--A POWER TO KEEP FROM SIN AND BE CONTENT WITH GOD'S WILL WHATEVER HE MAY PLEASE TO SEND
HE SHOULD CERTAINLY TREMBLE
AND THEN THE LITTLE BABY WAS BORN WHEN I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
BUT THERE ARE NO TEARS IN THEM
HOW CAN YOU SUPPOSE I MEANT THAT
FATHER'S FORGOT THE COFFIN AYE LAD TH OLD TALE
ADAM HAD SEEN DINAH SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALWAYS AT THE HALL FARM WHERE HE WAS NOT VERY VIVIDLY CONSCIOUS OF ANY WOMAN'S PRESENCE EXCEPT HETTY'S AND HE HAD ONLY IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT SETH WAS IN LOVE WITH HER SO THAT HIS ATTENTION HAD NOT HITHERTO BEEN DRAWN TOWARDS HER FOR HIS BROTHER'S SAKE
NAY I'M PRETTY SURE BY WORDS SHE SAID TO ME LAST SABBATH AS SHE'S NO MIND TO MARRY EH THEE'T AS CONTRAIRY AS THE REST ON EM
THE EVIDENCE IS VERY STRONG
WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
NOT BEFORE GOOD-NIGHT SIR SAID ADAM
WHY THIS IS LIKE OLD DAYS ARTHUR
FOR IF IT BE TRUE THAT NATURE AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SEEMS CHARGED WITH A PRESENTIMENT OF ONE INDIVIDUAL LOT MUST IT NOT ALSO BE TRUE THAT SHE SEEMS UNMINDFUL UNCONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER
AND NOW YOU MENTION IT I WISH SHE WOULD COME FOR IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A GENTLE MILD WOMAN LIKE HER MIGHT MOVE HETTY TO OPEN HER HEART
FOR HE WAS A GREAT FOOL ABOUT HER STILL--WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF SEEING HER--INDEED HAD NOT CARED MUCH TO LOOK AT ANY OTHER WOMAN SINCE HE PARTED FROM HER
IT WAS A GOODLY SIGHT--THAT TABLE WITH MARTIN POYSER'S ROUND GOOD-HUMOURED FACE AND LARGE PERSON AT THE HEAD OF IT HELPING HIS SERVANTS TO THE FRAGRANT ROAST BEEF AND PLEASED WHEN THE EMPTY PLATES CAME AGAIN
I WOULDN'T GIVE A PENNY FOR A MAN AS UD DRIVE A NAIL IN SLACK BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET EXTRA PAY FOR IT I KNOW THAT ADAM
I'LL RUN TO MOTHER HE SAID IN A LOUD WHISPER
BUT COME IN COME IN HE ADDED MAKING WAY FOR THEM
YES SAID ADAM
YES SAID ADAM
BUT THIS BLAMELESS CONDUCT ACCORDING TO MRS POYSER SHROUDED A SECRET INDULGENCE OF UNBECOMING WISHES WHICH SHE NOW DRAGGED FORTH AND HELD UP TO MOLLY'S VIEW WITH CUTTING ELOQUENCE
THIS WAS A STANDING SUBJECT OF DIFFERENCE RARELY ALLUDED TO AND DINAH WISHING TO QUIT IT AT ONCE SAID DIDST REMEMBER ADAM TO SPEAK TO COLONEL DONNITHORNE THE WORDS MY UNCLE AND AUNT ENTRUSTED TO THEE YES AND HE'S GOING TO THE HALL FARM WITH MR IRWINE THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW
HE UNDERSTOOD NOW WHAT SHE HAD BEEN AIMING AT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION
SHE WOULD HAVE BORNE ANYTHING RATHER THAN BE LAUGHED AT OR POINTED AT WITH ANY OTHER FEELING THAN ADMIRATION
SHE WAS A GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT-AND-THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL-SHAPEN LIGHT-FOOTED
EH MY LAD...ADAM MY POOR LAD THEE WOULDSTNA LIKE ME TO LEAVE THEE TO GO AND FETCH DINAH SAID SETH AS HIS MOTHER SOBBED AND ROCKED HERSELF TO AND FRO
FOR THREE WEEKS AT LEAST HER INWARD LIFE HAD CONSISTED OF LITTLE ELSE THAN LIVING THROUGH IN MEMORY THE LOOKS AND WORDS ARTHUR HAD DIRECTED TOWARDS HER--OF LITTLE ELSE THAN RECALLING THE SENSATIONS WITH WHICH SHE HEARD HIS VOICE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND SAW HIM ENTER AND BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON HER AND THEN BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT A TALL FIGURE LOOKING DOWN ON HER WITH EYES THAT SEEMED TO TOUCH HER WAS COMING NEARER IN CLOTHES OF BEAUTIFUL TEXTURE WITH AN ODOUR LIKE THAT OF A FLOWER-GARDEN BORNE ON THE EVENING BREEZE
AND IT WAS ALREADY LATE ENOUGH TO GO AND DRESS FOR DINNER FOR HIS GRANDFATHER'S DINNER-HOUR WAS SIX
TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER-DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
AYE AYE MY BOY YOU'LL GET ON
HER IMAGINATION NO LONGER SAW HAPPINESS WITH ARTHUR FOR HE COULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY OR SOOTHE HER PRIDE
AND HER FAVOURITE DOLLY THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER AT MR BURGE'S WHO HAD COME TO CONDOLE WITH HER IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS SHE HEARD OF THIAS'S DEATH WAS TOO DIM-SIGHTED TO BE OF MUCH USE
I THOUGHT SHE'D BEEN LED WRONG AND GOT INTO TROUBLE BUT IF SHE WAS GOING TO HER FRIENDS IT WOULD BE A GOOD WORK TO KEEP HER OUT OF FURTHER HARM THE WITNESS THEN STATED THAT IN THE NIGHT A CHILD WAS BORN AND SHE IDENTIFIED THE BABY-CLOTHES THEN SHOWN TO HER AS THOSE IN WHICH SHE HAD HERSELF DRESSED THE CHILD
AND ON THE WHOLE I DARESAY SOCIETY WAS NOT MUCH THE WORSE BECAUSE BEN HAD NOT SIX MONTHS OF IT AT THE TREADMILL FOR HIS VIEWS OF DEPREDATION WERE NARROW AND THE HOUSE OF CORRECTION MIGHT HAVE ENLARGED THEM
I'M GOING TO SHUT UP MY SCHOOL--IF THE SCHOLARS COME THEY MUST GO BACK AGAIN THAT'S ALL--AND I SHALL GO TO STONITON AND LOOK AFTER ADAM TILL THIS BUSINESS IS OVER
THE READING CLASS NOW SEATED ON THE FORM IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOLMASTER'S DESK CONSISTED OF THE THREE MOST BACKWARD PUPILS
A HARD AND EVEN FIERCE LOOK HAD COME IN THE EYES THOUGH THEIR LASHES WERE AS LONG AS EVER AND THEY HAD ALL THEIR DARK BRIGHTNESS
AND THEN CAME THE FRIGHTENING THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD TO CONCEAL HER MISERY AS WELL AS TO BEAR IT IN THIS DREARY DAYLIGHT THAT WAS COMING
AND BY GOOD FORTUNE HALSELL COMMON LAY IN HIS ROAD AND GAVE HIM SOME FINE LEAPS FOR RATTLER
IT WAS ONLY A SMALL WHITE-AND-LIVER-COLOURED SPANIEL WHICH SAT ON THE FRONT LEDGE OF THE WAGGON WITH LARGE TIMID EYES AND AN INCESSANT TREMBLING IN THE BODY SUCH AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IN SOME OF THESE SMALL CREATURES
HIS FACE WAS EVEN THINNER AND MORE WORN THAN WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT HE WAS WASHED AND SHAVEN THIS SUNDAY MORNING
THEY THAT ARE STRONG OUGHT TO BEAR THE INFIRMITIES OF THOSE THAT ARE WEAK AND NOT TO PLEASE THEMSELVES THERE'S A TEXT WANTS NO CANDLE TO SHOW'T
THE WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN SHUT UP HALF AN HOUR OR MORE IN ADAM BEDE'S TIMBER-YARD WHICH USED TO BE JONATHAN BURGE'S AND THE MELLOW EVENING LIGHT IS FALLING ON THE PLEASANT HOUSE WITH THE BUFF WALLS AND THE SOFT GREY THATCH VERY MUCH AS IT DID WHEN WE SAW ADAM BRINGING IN THE KEYS ON THAT JUNE EVENING NINE YEARS AGO
TIMOTHY'S BESS THOUGH RETAINING HER MAIDEN APPELLATION AMONG HER FAMILIARS HAD LONG BEEN THE WIFE OF SANDY JIM AND POSSESSED A HANDSOME SET OF MATRONLY JEWELS OF WHICH IT IS ENOUGH TO MENTION THE HEAVY BABY SHE WAS ROCKING IN HER ARMS AND THE STURDY FELLOW OF FIVE IN KNEE-BREECHES AND RED LEGS WHO HAD A RUSTY MILK-CAN ROUND HIS NECK BY WAY OF DRUM AND WAS VERY CAREFULLY AVOIDED BY CHAD'S SMALL TERRIER
A MAN THAT'S GOT OUR TRADE AT HIS FINGER-ENDS IS AT HOME EVERYWHERE
BUT YOU GO OUT A WALK SOMETIMES THESE PLEASANT EVENINGS DON'T YOU
SHE STOOPED NOW TO GATHER UP HER SEWING AND THEN WENT ON WITH IT AS BEFORE
SO WAS SETH FOR THROUGH LISBETH'S OBSTINATE REFUSAL TO HAVE ANY WOMAN-HELPER IN THE HOUSE HE HAD LEARNED TO MAKE HIMSELF AS ADAM SAID VERY HANDY IN THE HOUSEWORK THAT HE MIGHT SAVE HIS MOTHER FROM TOO GREAT WEARINESS
IT'S SPLENDID OUT OF DOORS NOW
TO FLIRT WITH HETTY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR FROM FLIRTING WITH A PRETTY GIRL OF HIS OWN STATION
AND WHEN A MAN'S SAID WHAT HE MEANS HE'D BETTER STOP FOR TH ALE ULL BE NONE THE BETTER FOR STANNIN AN I'LL NOT SAY HOW WE LIKE TH ALE YET FOR WE COULDNA WELL TASTE IT TILL WE'D DRUNK YOUR HEALTH IN IT
ARTHUR HAD TURNED INTO THE HOUSE
AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER BOOKS THAT YOU MAY LIKE TO SEE IRWINE--PAMPHLETS ABOUT ANTINOMIANISM AND EVANGELICALISM WHATEVER THEY MAY BE
I KNOW WHAT THEY'LL TURN TO--STINGING GNATS STINGING GNATS
AN I KNOW ONE THING AS IF TROUBLE WAS TO COME AN I WAS TO BE LAID UP I MY BED AN THE CHILDREN WAS TO DIE--AS THERE'S NO KNOWING BUT WHAT THEY WILL--AN THE MURRAIN WAS TO COME AMONG THE CATTLE AGAIN AN EVERYTHING WENT TO RACK AN RUIN I SAY WE MIGHT BE GLAD TO GET SIGHT O DINAH'S CAP AGAIN WI HER OWN FACE UNDER IT BORDER OR NO BORDER
THEE THINK'ST THY MOTHER KNOWS NOUGHT BUT SHE WAR ALIVE AFORE THEE WAST BORN BUT THEE CANSTNA BE SURE AS THE TREMBLING MEANS LOVE SAID ADAM ANXIOUSLY
AS FOR HETTY SHE WAS SOON IN THE WOOD AGAIN--HER WAKING DREAMS BEING MERGED IN A SLEEPING LIFE SCARCELY MORE FRAGMENTARY AND CONFUSED
I CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE ALL MY LOVE AND REVERENCE TO SUCH RARITIES
UNDERSTANDS FARMING--HE'S CARRYING ON THE DRAINING AND ALL THAT CAPITAL
MR AND MRS POYSER CAN TELL YOU WHERE I WAS
SO HE CURED THE LAME AND THE SICK AND THE BLIND AND HE WORKED MIRACLES TO FEED THE HUNGRY BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS SORRY FOR THEM
SHE'S MADE OUT O STUFF WITH A FINER GRAIN THAN MOST O THE WOMEN
AND IT'S NO USE FILLING YOUR POCKET FULL O MONEY IF YOU'VE GOT A HOLE IN THE CORNER
WE BOTH SERVE THE SAME MASTER AND ARE STRIVING AFTER THE SAME GIFTS
ADAM WAS RATHER PALER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GOT UP TO THANK HIS FRIENDS
ONE MORSEL'S AS GOOD AS ANOTHER WHEN YOUR MOUTH'S OUT O TASTE
HUSBANDS AND WIVES MUST BE CONTENT WHEN THEY'VE LIVED TO REAR THEIR CHILDREN AND SEE ONE ANOTHER'S HAIR GREY AYE AYE SAID MR POYSER
AND SETH TOO HAD STRAIGHTENED HIS BACK AND WAS PUTTING OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS HIS PAPER CAP
SHE DROPPED HER CURTSIES AGAIN WITHOUT LOOKING UP AND WITH A GROWING TREMULOUSNESS ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH AND THEN TURNED AWAY
BUT AS TO MARRYING ADAM THAT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR
WILL YOU CONTRIVE FOR ME TO WALK OUT IN THE GARDEN A BIT WITH YOU THIS EVENING IF IT KEEPS FINE HETTY
SHE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE SORROW
ASK HER TO COME IN SAID ADAM
IT'S A PRETTY WHEEL
WHAT'S IT SINNIFY ABOUT HER BEIN A METHODY
SHE'S MADE OUR BREAD BITTER TO US FOR ALL OUR LIVES TO COME AN WE SHALL NE'ER HOLD UP OUR HEADS I THIS PARISH NOR I ANY OTHER
WE CAN TALK BETTER THERE THE HERMITAGE HAD NEVER BEEN ENTERED SINCE THEY LEFT IT TOGETHER FOR ARTHUR HAD LOCKED UP THE KEY IN HIS DESK
HE PREACHED A DEAL ABOUT DOCTRINES
AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I'VE GOT LOTS O SHEETING AND TABLE-CLOTHING AND TOWELLING AS ISN'T MADE UP
AND IT PERHAPS WAS AS HE HAD SOMETIMES IN HIS MORE CHEERFUL MOMENTS HOPED IT WOULD BE--HER HEART WAS REALLY TURNING WITH ALL THE MORE WARMTH TOWARDS THE MAN SHE KNEW TO HAVE A SERIOUS LOVE FOR HER
I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MRS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
ALL WAS STILL AS WHEN HE OPENED IT AN HOUR BEFORE
SHE MUST THINK OF SOME REASON TO TELL THEM WHY SHE HAD ASKED FOR HIM
FOR ADAM HAD TO GIVE HIS OPINION OF THE NEW TAP WHICH COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAN COMPLIMENTARY TO MRS POYSER
FOR MR IRWINE'S VOICE HAD CEASED AND THE GROUP ROUND THE WHITE THORN WAS DISPERSING ITSELF TOWARDS THE CHURCH
IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME--HARDLY TWO MONTHS--SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
HE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT SHE LIKED HIM BEST
AND BEFORE SIX O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE IN BROXTON AND HAYSLOPE WHO HAD NOT HEARD THE SAD NEWS
MR IRWINE NOW ROSE ALSO AND ADVANCING TOWARDS DINAH HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SAID GOOD-BYE
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D GO AGAINST THE WISHES OF THEM THAT LOVE YOU AND ARE AKIN TO YOU WITHOUT A GOOD AND SUFFICIENT REASON IN YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
I THINK THERE WAS HARDLY AN INHABITANT OF HAYSLOPE SPECIALLY MENTIONED IN THIS HISTORY AND STILL RESIDENT IN THE PARISH ON THIS NOVEMBER MORNING WHO WAS NOT EITHER IN CHURCH TO SEE ADAM AND DINAH MARRIED OR NEAR THE CHURCH DOOR TO GREET THEM AS THEY CAME FORTH
I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL AND I SPOKE AS POLITE AS I COULD
I NE'ER SOT UP SO I MY LIFE NOT TO SAY AS IT WARNA A MARR'IN OR A CHRISTENIN OR A WAKE OR TH HARVEST SUPPER
ISN'T KATE COMING TO LUNCH MISS IRWINE TOLD BRIDGET TO TAKE HER LUNCH UPSTAIRS SAID CARROLL
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A LAD I WENT WITH FATHER TO SEE ABOUT SOME WORK THERE
I DON'T LIKE TO SAY NO TO THAT SIR HE SAID BUT I CAN'T SHAKE HANDS TILL IT'S CLEAR WHAT WE MEAN BY'T
SUSPENSE WAS GONE NOW AND HE MUST BEAR THE UNALTERABLE
I HAVE OFTEN BEEN FAVOURED WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF THESE SELECT NATURES AND FIND THEM TO CONCUR IN THE EXPERIENCE THAT GREAT MEN ARE OVERESTIMATED AND SMALL MEN ARE INSUPPORTABLE
HE HAD NEVER YET DONE SO OFTEN AS THEY HAD WALKED TOGETHER FOR HE HAD OBSERVED THAT SHE NEVER WALKED ARM-IN-ARM WITH SETH AND HE THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT KIND OF SUPPORT WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO HER
COME SETH LET US GO TOGETHER THEY WENT UPSTAIRS AND FOR FIVE MINUTES ALL WAS SILENCE
YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS--WITH AN INHERITANCE OF AFFECTIONS NURTURED BY A SIMPLE FAMILY LIFE OF COMMON NEED AND COMMON INDUSTRY AND AN INHERITANCE OF FACULTIES TRAINED IN SKILFUL COURAGEOUS LABOUR
I'VE SOMETHING PARTIC'LAR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HETTY SAID VERY WELL SHE WAS REALLY AS ANXIOUS AS ADAM WAS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME PRIVATE TALK WITH HIM
DINAH AS YOU MUST GO AWAY FROM US SAID MR POYSER STILL PAUSING OVER HIS TEA-CUP
PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE
IT WAS A BITTER REMEMBRANCE TO HIM NOW--THAT MORNING WHEN ARTHUR BREAKFASTED WITH HIM AND SEEMED AS IF HE WERE ON THE VERGE OF A CONFESSION
HE COMES HERE TO PREACH OF A SUNDAY AFTERNOON SIR AN PUTS UP HIS HOSS HERE
HE WOULD GATHER IN AN INDIRECT WAY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING DECISIVE TO COMMUNICATE AT PRESENT
BUT SETH WITH AN ANXIOUS LOOK HAD PASSED INTO THE WORKSHOP AND SAID ADDY HOW'S THIS
SHE'S CUT OUT O DIFFERENT STUFF FROM MOST WOMEN
IF EVER A GIRL LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MADE OF ROSES THAT GIRL WAS HETTY IN HER SUNDAY HAT AND FROCK
IF IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE VERY GOOD IT WAS CLEAR SHE MUST BE IN A BAD WAY
I DON'T WANT TO QUARREL WITH ANY GENTLEMAN MORE PARTICULAR AN OLD GENTLEMAN TURNED EIGHTY AND I KNOW WE COULDN'T AGREE LONG
HETTY'S LITTLE BRAIN WAS BUSY WITH THIS COMBINATION AS SHE HUNG ON ADAM'S ARM AND SAID YES OR NO TO SOME SLIGHT OBSERVATIONS OF HIS ABOUT THE MANY HAWTHORN-BERRIES THERE WOULD BE FOR THE BIRDS THIS NEXT WINTER AND THE LOW-HANGING CLOUDS THAT WOULD HARDLY HOLD UP TILL MORNING
ADAM HAD BROUGHT HIMSELF TO THINK OF SEEING HETTY IF SHE WOULD CONSENT TO SEE HIM BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE MEETING MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A GOOD TO HER--MIGHT HELP TO MELT AWAY THIS TERRIBLE HARDNESS THEY TOLD HIM OF
THE PENCIL IS CONSCIOUS OF A DELIGHTFUL FACILITY IN DRAWING A GRIFFIN--THE LONGER THE CLAWS AND THE LARGER THE WINGS THE BETTER
YOU'LL BE CONTINUALLY IN MY PRAYERS THEY HAD NOW REACHED THE YARD-GATE AND SETH SAID I WON'T GO IN DINAH SO FAREWELL HE PAUSED AND HESITATED AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN HIM HER HAND AND THEN SAID THERE'S NO KNOWING BUT WHAT YOU MAY SEE THINGS DIFFERENT AFTER A WHILE
I SHALL SEE YOU TO-MORROW--TO SAY GOOD-BYE YOU KNOW ARTHUR WAS TOO MUCH PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PART HE WAS PLAYING HIMSELF TO BE THOROUGHLY AWARE OF THE EXPRESSION IN ADAM'S FACE
BUT I'D BE GLAD FOR DINAH T COME FOR SHE'D HELP THEE WI THE LITTLE UNS
YOUR LANDLADY IS SINCERELY AFFECTED AT PARTING WITH YOU RESPECTS YOU HIGHLY AND WILL REALLY REJOICE IF ANY ONE ELSE IS GENEROUS TO YOU
THE ROUNDED NECK THE DIMPLED ARM MOVE US BY SOMETHING MORE THAN THEIR PRETTINESS--BY THEIR CLOSE KINSHIP WITH ALL WE HAVE KNOWN OF TENDERNESS AND PEACE
THANK HEAVEN IT HAD TURNED OUT SO WELL
HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS
SHE READ SLOWLY
BUT FOR ALL THAT CASSON WAS PARTLY I THE RIGHT FOR ONCE
SHE DOESN'T MIND ABOUT MAKING FOLKS ENTER THE SOCIETY SO AS THEY'RE FIT T ENTER THE KINGDOM O GOD
ON LEAVING THE WORKSHOP ADAM LOCKED THE DOOR TOOK THE KEY OUT AND CARRIED IT TO THE HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WOODYARD
HE MUST FIND THE BEINGS TO WHOM HE COULD CLING WITH LOVING ADMIRATION AMONG THOSE WHO CAME WITHIN SPEECH OF HIM
IT ISN'T POSSIBLE
YOU MUST GO SOME DAY TOWARDS THE STONYSHIRE SIDE AND SEE WHAT ALTERATIONS THEY'RE MAKING
YES SIR AND THERE ARE LETTERS FOR YOU
BUT SHE WAS TOO EAGERLY OCCUPIED WITH HER VISION TO CARE ABOUT PICKING IT UP
FOR IF ANYTHING WAS T HAPPEN IT'S WELL TO KNOW HOW TO TURN YOUR HAND TO DIFFERENT SORTS O THINGS
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE INVALUABLE LABOURERS WHO CAN NOT ONLY TURN THEIR HAND TO EVERYTHING BUT EXCEL IN EVERYTHING THEY TURN THEIR HAND TO
AND ON SOME MORNINGS WHEN HE READ IN THE APOCRYPHA OF WHICH HE WAS VERY FOND THE SON OF SIRACH'S KEEN-EDGED WORDS WOULD BRING A DELIGHTED SMILE THOUGH HE ALSO ENJOYED THE FREEDOM OF OCCASIONALLY DIFFERING FROM AN APOCRYPHAL WRITER
I'VE GOT TH HEALTH AND THE LIMBS AND THE SPERRIT TO BEAR IT AT THIS MOMENT A SMART RAP AS IF WITH A WILLOW WAND WAS GIVEN AT THE HOUSE DOOR AND GYP INSTEAD OF BARKING AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED GAVE A LOUD HOWL
AS SOON AS HE GOT OUT OF DOORS HE BEGAN TO WALK AT HIS HABITUAL RAPID PACE HURRYING ALONG WITHOUT KNOWING WHY BUSY WITH THE PAINFUL THOUGHT THAT THE MEMORY OF THIS DAY SO FULL OF HONOUR AND PROMISE TO HIM WAS POISONED FOR EVER
BUT NOW YOU SEE I CAN CARRY THE BASKET WITH ONE ARM AS IF IT WAS AN EMPTY NUTSHELL AND GIVE YOU TH OTHER ARM TO LEAN ON
YE ARENA GETTING STIFF YET I RECKON
BUT I SHOULD BE LOATH TO LEAVE TH OLD PLACE AND THE PARISH WHERE I WAS BRED AND BORN AND FATHER AFORE ME
BUT HERE HER AUNT'S ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED FROM THIS TENDER SUBJECT BY TOTTY WHO PERCEIVING AT LENGTH THAT THE ARRIVAL OF HER COUSINS WAS NOT LIKELY TO BRING ANYTHING SATISFACTORY TO HER IN PARTICULAR BEGAN TO CRY MUNNY MUNNY IN AN EXPLOSIVE MANNER
I WANT THEE TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA MOTHER ANSWERED SETH TENDERLY
DINAH SAID WILL YOU LET ME COME IN HETTY AND HETTY WITHOUT SPEAKING FOR SHE WAS CONFUSED AND VEXED OPENED THE DOOR WIDER AND LET HER IN
NOW HE LOOKS AT YOU WITH LOVE AND MERCY AND SAYS COME TO ME THAT YOU MAY HAVE LIFE
BUT HE TURNED ROUND AGAIN SETTING HIS BACK AGAINST THE BOOKCASE AND LOOKING FIERCELY AT MR IRWINE
LET HER COME BY THE SIDE O ME THEN
IT WAS TO THIS WORKMAN THAT THE STRONG BARYTONE BELONGED WHICH WAS HEARD ABOVE THE SOUND OF PLANE AND HAMMER SINGING AWAKE MY SOUL AND WITH THE SUN THY DAILY STAGE OF DUTY RUN
I WONDER HOW IT IS HE'S COME SO EARLY MRS POYSER HASTENED TO THE DOOR FOR THE PLEASURE OF LOOKING AT HER DARLING IN A NEW POSITION WITH LOVE IN HER EYES BUT REPROOF ON HER TONGUE
LITTLE GELLS O FIVE YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO BE CARRIED
BY SIX O'CLOCK THE TASK WAS DONE THE COFFIN NAILED DOWN AND ADAM AND SETH WERE ON THEIR WAY HOME
AND LADIES WITH THAT FINE INTUITION WHICH IS THE DISTINGUISHING ATTRIBUTE OF THEIR SEX SEE AT ONCE THAT HE IS NICE THE CHANCES ARE THAT HE WILL GO THROUGH LIFE WITHOUT SCANDALIZING ANY ONE
BUT I THINK YOU LOOK A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY AT IT
A WOMAN MAY GET TO LOVE BY DEGREES--THE BEST FIRE DOSNA FLARE UP THE SOONEST
AND THEN YOU MIGHT GET MARRIED TO SOME DECENT MAN AND THERE'D BE PLENTY READY TO HAVE YOU IF YOU'D ONLY LEAVE OFF THAT PREACHING AS IS TEN TIMES WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOUR AUNT JUDITH EVER DID
WE'VE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE NOW WITH ONLY OUR TWO SELVES AND MOTHER
I SHALL GO TO MRS BEST'S ROOM AN SIT DOWN STOP A BIT STOP A BIT SAID MR POYSER
WHEN DEATH THE GREAT RECONCILER HAS COME IT IS NEVER OUR TENDERNESS THAT WE REPENT OF BUT OUR SEVERITY
BUT ANOTHER THOUGHT GAVE HIM COURAGE
MY NAME IS JOHN OLDING
THERE WAS ALWAYS A SUPERFLUITY OF BROAD BEANS--IT TOOK NINE OR TEN OF ADAM'S STRIDES TO GET TO THE END OF THE UNCUT GRASS WALK THAT RAN BY THE SIDE OF THEM
HIS MIND WAS SO OCCUPIED WITH IMAGINARY ARGUMENTS AGAINST SUCH SUSPICIONS THAT HE COULD NOT LISTEN TO THE CROSS-EXAMINATION BY HETTY'S COUNSEL WHO TRIED WITHOUT RESULT TO ELICIT EVIDENCE THAT THE PRISONER HAD SHOWN SOME MOVEMENTS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION TOWARDS THE CHILD
YE'LL NOT FIND MANY MEN O SIX-AN TWENTY AS ULL DO TO PUT I THE SHAFTS WI HIM
SUDDENLY WHEN HE WAS FAR ON THROUGH THE CHASE HE STOPPED STARTLED BY A FLASH OF REVIVING HOPE
HE WAR A GOOD FEYTHER TO THEE AFORE HE TOOK TO TH DRINK
THERE'S THE SPERRIT O GOD IN ALL THINGS AND ALL TIMES--WEEKDAY AS WELL AS SUNDAY--AND I THE GREAT WORKS AND INVENTIONS AND I THE FIGURING AND THE MECHANICS
HE OWNS ALL THE LAND ABOUT HERE SIR SQUIRE DONNITHORNE DOES WELL IT'S A PRETTY SPOT WHOEVER MAY OWN IT SAID THE TRAVELLER MOUNTING HIS HORSE
SHE HAD A SMALL RED-LEATHER POCKET-BOOK IN HER POCKET WITH TWO NAMES WRITTEN IN IT--ONE AT THE BEGINNING HETTY SORREL HAYSLOPE AND THE OTHER NEAR THE END DINAH MORRIS SNOWFIELD SHE WILL NOT SAY WHICH IS HER OWN NAME--SHE DENIES EVERYTHING AND WILL ANSWER NO QUESTIONS AND APPLICATION HAS BEEN MADE TO ME AS A MAGISTRATE THAT I MAY TAKE MEASURES FOR IDENTIFYING HER FOR IT WAS THOUGHT PROBABLE THAT THE NAME WHICH STANDS FIRST IS HER OWN NAME BUT WHAT PROOF HAVE THEY GOT AGAINST HER IF IT IS HETTY SAID ADAM STILL VIOLENTLY WITH AN EFFORT THAT SEEMED TO SHAKE HIS WHOLE FRAME
AND MASTER LOOKS UNACCOUNTABLE--AS IF HE WAS FRIGHTENED ADAM TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE WORDS
THEY WORK AT DIFFERENT THINGS--SOME IN THE MILL AND MANY IN THE MINES IN THE VILLAGES ROUND ABOUT
IT IS GENERALLY A FEMININE EYE THAT FIRST DETECTS THE MORAL DEFICIENCIES HIDDEN UNDER THE DEAR DECEIT OF BEAUTY SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MRS POYSER WITH HER KEENNESS AND ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITY FOR OBSERVATION SHOULD HAVE FORMED A TOLERABLY FAIR ESTIMATE OF WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM HETTY IN THE WAY OF FEELING AND IN MOMENTS OF INDIGNATION SHE HAD SOMETIMES SPOKEN WITH GREAT OPENNESS ON THE SUBJECT TO HER HUSBAND
SHE CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU
WHAT WAS IT THEN TO HETTY
BUT AS HE EXPECTED GYP WHO LAY IN THE WORKSHOP GAVE A SHARP BARK
WHY WHAT DO YOU DO HERE YOUNG WOMAN THE MAN SAID ROUGHLY
AND YOU'LL BE RUNNING INTO BAD COMPANY I EXPECT PUTTING YOUR NOSE IN EVERY HOLE AND CORNER WHERE YOU'VE NO BUSINESS
THE OLD FELLOW WANTS ME TO EXCOMMUNICATE THE WHEELWRIGHT AND THEN DELIVER HIM OVER TO THE CIVIL ARM--THAT IS TO SAY TO YOUR GRANDFATHER--TO BE TURNED OUT OF HOUSE AND YARD
THIS LITTLE WALK WAS A REST TO ADAM AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CHARM OF THE MOMENT
HAPPEN HE KNOWSNA AS HE WANTS T SEE HER
BEHIND IT LAY A BRIGHT HAZY SOMETHING--DAYS THAT WERE NOT TO BE AS THE OTHER DAYS OF HER LIFE HAD BEEN
AYE AYE SAID BARTLE
AND DINAH FELT A DEEP JOY IN THE FIRST SIGN THAT HER LOVE WAS WELCOMED BY THE WRETCHED LOST ONE
HE WAS A TALL BUT THIN AND WIRY MAN NEARLY AS OLD AS BRIMSTONE WITH A VERY PALE FACE AND HANDS STAINED A DEEP BLUE
AND AS FOR AGE WHAT THAT'S WORTH DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY O THE LIQUOR
I'VE GOT A GUN I OUR ROOM HANNA I
THE GENTLE TONES THE LOVING PERSUASION DID NOT TOUCH HER BUT WHEN THE MORE SEVERE APPEALS CAME SHE BEGAN TO BE FRIGHTENED
HE WAS AS HONEST A FELLOW AS WE EVER HAD ABOUT THE HOUSE--THEY'RE ALL HONEST FOLKS IN THE NORTH I NEVER SAW A PRETTIER YOUNG WOMAN IN MY LIFE SAID THE HUSBAND
I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM--THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
THE STRONG MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SUPPRESS THE SIGNS OF SORROW HAD FELT HIS HEART SWELL LIKE A CHILD'S AT THIS FIRST APPROACH OF SYMPATHY
I COULD SWEAR TO YOUR BACK A LONG WAY OFF
DID HE SAY HE'D BE COMING TO SEE US SOON
ANNE MY DEAR I SEE THAT FIDDLE-SCRAPING IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU
AND IT'S A BIG SUM--IT'S A BIG SUM
I CAN NEVER BRING HER HERE WITH ME FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD BE STRUCK WITH MRS POYSER'S EYE AND THE POOR BITCH MIGHT GO LIMPING FOR EVER AFTER I'VE NEVER ANY NEED TO DRIVE GYP BACK SAID ADAM LAUGHING
WHAT GENTLEMAN IS IT YOU WANT
SHE COULD SEE THE HEAD OF EVERY PIN ON HER RED CLOTH PIN-CUSHION
TOTTY IMMEDIATELY WITH GREAT GRAVITY LIFTED UP HER FROCK AND SHOWED A TINY PINK POCKET AT PRESENT IN A STATE OF COLLAPSE
LET ALL PEOPLE WHO HOLD UNEXCEPTIONABLE OPINIONS ACT UNEXCEPTIONABLY
SHE'D TELL ME THE RIGHTS ON'T BELIKE--SHE'D HAPPEN KNOW SOME GOOD I ALL THIS TROUBLE AN HEART-BREAK COMIN UPO THAT POOR LAD AS NE'ER DONE A BIT O WRONG IN'S LIFE BUT WAR BETTER NOR ANYBODY ELSE'S SON PICK THE COUNTRY ROUND
I NEVER HAD A RIGHT NOTION O ROCKS TILL I WENT THERE HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GET THERE WHY IT TOOK US THE BEST PART O TWO DAYS WALKING
WHEN A MAN'S GOT HIS LIMBS WHOLE HE CAN BEAR A SMART CUT OR TWO AS ADAM WAS GETTING OVER A STILE AT THIS POINT IN HIS REFLECTIONS HE PERCEIVED A MAN WALKING ALONG THE FIELD BEFORE HIM
BUT I SHOULD LIKE BETTER TO SHARE IN YOUR TROUBLE AND YOUR LABOUR AND IT WOULD SEEM HARDER TO ME IF YOU DENIED ME THAT
BUT THERE IS NO KNOWING FOR JUST THEN ADAM WAS SAYING WITH QUIET SURPRISE WHY I HOPED DINAH WAS SETTLED AMONG US FOR LIFE
BUT DEAR AUNT DON'T THINK ANY MORE ABOUT THAT
INDEED SIR YOU ARE VERY KIND TO TAKE THAT NOTICE OF HER
AND WHILE HER AUNT WAS DISCOURSING TO HIM ABOUT THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MILK THAT WAS TO BE SPARED FOR BUTTER AND CHEESE SO LONG AS THE CALVES WERE NOT ALL WEANED AND A LARGE QUANTITY BUT INFERIOR QUALITY OF MILK YIELDED BY THE SHORTHORN WHICH HAD BEEN BOUGHT ON EXPERIMENT TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WHICH MUST BE INTERESTING TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO WOULD ONE DAY BE A LANDLORD HETTY TOSSED AND PATTED HER POUND OF BUTTER WITH QUITE A SELF-POSSESSED COQUETTISH AIR SLYLY CONSCIOUS THAT NO TURN OF HER HEAD WAS LOST
BUT SAID ADAM I'VE SEEN PRETTY CLEAR EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG UN AS RELIGION'S SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES NOTIONS
AND I'LL PUT TWO OR THREE OF THESE THINGS AWAY AND MAKE THE HOUSE LOOK MORE COMFORTABLE COMFORTABLE
BUT SHE'S GONE ON DENYING SHE'S HAD A CHILD FROM FIRST TO LAST
AND THE SILVER COFFEE-POT WHICH CARROLL WAS BRINGING IN SENT FORTH A FRAGRANT STEAM WHICH COMPLETED THE DELIGHTS OF A BACHELOR BREAKFAST
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD HA THOUGHT OF HER AND HER LETTER IF I'D NEVER SEEN HER
I FORGIVE YOUR MOMENTARY INJUSTICE--IT WAS QUITE NATURAL WITH THE EXAGGERATED NOTIONS YOU HAD IN YOUR MIND
ONCE ON MEG'S BACK IN THE FRESH AIR OF THAT FINE MORNING HE SHOULD BE MORE MASTER OF THE SITUATION
BUT IF YOU FEED YOUR YOUNG SETTER ON RAW FLESH HOW CAN YOU WONDER AT ITS RETAINING A RELISH FOR UNCOOKED PARTRIDGE IN AFTER-LIFE
MRS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND GAVE THE TWO HILARIOUS DAMSELS A LOOK WHICH DROVE THEM INTO THE BACK KITCHEN AND UNSPEARING HER KNITTING BEGAN TO KNIT AGAIN WITH HER USUAL RAPIDITY AS SHE RE-ENTERED THE HOUSE
WELL SHE WAS MIGHTY PLEASED WITH THE SCREEN AND THEN SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT PAY SHE WAS TO GIVE ME
AND THERE'S A LOT O FOOLISH WOMEN IN FINE CLOTHES WITH GEWGAWS ALL UP THEIR ARMS AND FEATHERS ON THEIR HEADS SITTING NEAR THE JUDGE
AND SO ADAM WENT TO BED COMFORTED HAVING WOVEN FOR HIMSELF AN INGENIOUS WEB OF PROBABILITIES--THE SUREST SCREEN A WISE MAN CAN PLACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE TRUTH
AND THE DARK PURPLISH BROWN OF THE PLOUGHED EARTH AND OF THE BARE BRANCHES IS BEAUTIFUL TOO
THE RECTOR HAD BEEN SO MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH DINAH THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN TO CLOSE IT EARLIER
THE LANDLORD TOOK UP THE ORNAMENTS AND PUSHED OUT HIS LIPS IN A MEDITATIVE MANNER
NATURE HAS WRITTEN OUT HIS BRIDE'S CHARACTER FOR HIM IN THOSE EXQUISITE LINES OF CHEEK AND LIP AND CHIN IN THOSE EYELIDS DELICATE AS PETALS IN THOSE LONG LASHES CURLED LIKE THE STAMEN OF A FLOWER IN THE DARK LIQUID DEPTHS OF THOSE WONDERFUL EYES
WHAT GRAND BEECHES
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY ADDERS AND WASPS AND FOXES AND WILD BEASTS ARE A BLESSING WHEN THEY'RE ONLY THE EVILS THAT BELONG TO THIS STATE O PROBATION WHICH IT'S LAWFUL FOR A MAN TO KEEP AS CLEAR OF AS HE CAN IN THIS LIFE HOPING TO GET QUIT OF EM FOR EVER IN ANOTHER--HOPING TO GET QUIT OF EM FOR EVER IN ANOTHER BARTLE HAD BECOME SO EXCITED AND ANGRY IN THE COURSE OF HIS INVECTIVE THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS SUPPER AND ONLY USED THE KNIFE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAPPING THE TABLE WITH THE HAFT
FOR DINAH HAD THAT BELIEF IN VISIBLE MANIFESTATIONS OF JESUS WHICH IS COMMON AMONG THE METHODISTS AND SHE COMMUNICATED IT IRRESISTIBLY TO HER HEARERS
THE LITTLE DARLING IS SO FOND OF HIM HER LITTLE VANITIES ARE SO BEWITCHING HE WOULDN'T CONSENT TO HER BEING A BIT WISER
ADAM WAS A CLEAR-SIGHTED FAIR-MINDED MAN--A FINE FELLOW INDEED MORALLY AS WELL AS PHYSICALLY
WE SHALL KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT THE LIGHT TAP CAME IF WE LEAVE HETTY FOR A SHORT TIME AND RETURN TO DINAH AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD DELIVERED TOTTY TO HER MOTHER'S ARMS AND WAS COME UPSTAIRS TO HER BEDROOM ADJOINING HETTY'S
AND NOW GOOD MORNING JOSHUA
ADAM CAME DOWN AND SET TO WORK AGAIN SAYING TO HIMSELF I WON'T OPEN THE DOOR AGAIN
SIXTY YEARS AGO--IT IS A LONG TIME SO NO WONDER THINGS HAVE CHANGED--ALL CLERGYMEN WERE NOT ZEALOUS
THE LANDLADY SAT OPPOSITE TO HER AS SHE ATE AND LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY
THAT'S A PLACE O TRUST AND THEE'T ABOVE A COMMON WORKMAN NOW AYE SAID ADAM BUT NOBODY KNOWS A WORD ABOUT IT YET
HERE IS THE PRIZE FOR THE FIRST SACK-RACE SAID MISS LYDIA TAKING A LARGE PARCEL FROM THE TABLE WHERE THE PRIZES WERE LAID AND GIVING IT TO MRS IRWINE BEFORE BESSY CAME UP AN EXCELLENT GROGRAM GOWN AND A PIECE OF FLANNEL YOU DIDN'T THINK THE WINNER WAS TO BE SO YOUNG I SUPPOSE AUNT SAID ARTHUR
TH LADS ON'Y KNOW WHAT I TELL EM
AT THE FIRST MOMENT ARTHUR HAD FELT PURE DISTRESS AND SELF-REPROACH AT DISCOVERING THAT ADAM'S HAPPINESS WAS INVOLVED IN HIS RELATION TO HETTY
I'D RATHER HAVE IT THAN BEER ANY DAY AYE AYE SAID MRS POYSER REACHING A SMALL WHITE BASIN THAT STOOD ON THE SHELF AND DIPPING IT INTO THE WHEY-TUB THE SMELL O BREAD'S SWEET T EVERYBODY BUT THE BAKER
AND PERHAPS HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHO DID NOT THINK HIS SISTERS UNINTERESTING AND SUPERFLUOUS
MR IRWINE WHO HAD BEEN A REGULAR CORRESPONDENT TELLING HIM ALL THE NEWS ABOUT THE OLD PLACES AND PEOPLE HAD SENT HIM WORD NEARLY THREE MONTHS AGO THAT ADAM BEDE WAS NOT TO MARRY MARY BURGE AS HE HAD THOUGHT BUT PRETTY HETTY SORREL
HETTY'S LOOK DID NOT REALLY MEAN SO MUCH AS HE THOUGHT
HAVE YOU GOT NOTHING BETTER TO THINK ON THIS GOOD SUNDAY AS POOR OLD THIAS BEDE'S TO BE PUT INTO THE GROUND AND HIM DROWNDED I TH DEAD O THE NIGHT AS IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE'S BACK RUN COLD BUT YOU MUST BE DIZENING YOURSELF AS IF THERE WAS A WEDDING I'STID OF A FUNERAL WELL AUNT SAID HETTY I CAN'T BE READY SO SOON AS EVERYBODY ELSE WHEN I'VE GOT TOTTY'S THINGS TO PUT ON
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ME NOW FOR NANCY AND MOLLY ARE CLEVER AT THEIR WORK AND YOU'RE IN GOOD HEALTH NOW BY THE BLESSING OF GOD AND MY UNCLE IS OF A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE AGAIN AND YOU HAVE NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS NOT A FEW--SOME OF THEM COME TO SIT WITH MY UNCLE ALMOST DAILY
WITH YOUR NEWLY APPOINTED VICAR WHOSE STYLE OF PREACHING YOU FIND PAINFULLY BELOW THAT OF HIS REGRETTED PREDECESSOR
THEIR NOTES ARE AS CLEAR AS THE CLEAR AIR
HE'S A CUSHION MADE ON PURPOSE FOR EM BUT SHE'S A DOWNRIGHT GOOD-NATUR'D WOMAN FOR ALL THAT SAID ADAM AND AS TRUE AS THE DAYLIGHT
HE WAS READY TO PITCH EVERYTHING ELSE--NO MATTER WHERE--FOR THE SAKE OF SURRENDERING HIMSELF TO THIS DELICIOUS FEELING WHICH HAD JUST DISCLOSED ITSELF
ARTHUR WHO HAD SEEMED SO NEAR TO HER ONLY A FEW HOURS BEFORE WAS SEPARATED FROM HER AS THE HERO OF A GREAT PROCESSION IS SEPARATED FROM A SMALL OUTSIDER IN THE CROWD
TO BE SURE THE GIRL GOT CLOSER TEMPERED AND SOMETIMES SHE SEEMED AS IF THERE'D BE NO DRAWING A WORD FROM HER WITH CART-ROPES BUT SHE THOUGHT MUCH LESS ABOUT HER DRESS AND WENT AFTER THE WORK QUITE EAGERLY WITHOUT ANY TELLING
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME SAID MR IRWINE AS ARTHUR PAUSED AND STEPPED IN OVER THE LOW WINDOW-SILL
AND HERE WAS DEAR OLD HAYSLOPE AT LAST SLEEPING ON THE HILL LIKE A QUIET OLD PLACE AS IT WAS IN THE LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT AND OPPOSITE TO IT THE GREAT SHOULDERS OF THE BINTON HILLS BELOW THEM THE PURPLISH BLACKNESS OF THE HANGING WOODS AND AT LAST THE PALE FRONT OF THE ABBEY LOOKING OUT FROM AMONG THE OAKS OF THE CHASE AS IF ANXIOUS FOR THE HEIR'S RETURN
DINAH EVIDENTLY A LITTLE THE TALLER AS SHE PUT HER ARM ROUND HETTY'S WAIST AND KISSED HER FOREHEAD
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW RICH IS THE HARVEST OF SOULS UP THOSE HIGH-WALLED STREETS WHERE YOU SEEMED TO WALK AS IN A PRISON-YARD AND THE EAR IS DEAFENED WITH THE SOUNDS OF WORLDLY TOIL
THE CONFIDENCE SHE FELT IN HER OWN POWERS OF EXPOSITION WAS A MOTIVE FORCE THAT OVERCAME ALL RESISTANCE
THE HORRIBLE THOUGHT OF WANT AND BEGGARY DROVE HER ONCE TO THINK SHE WOULD GO BACK TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND ASK THEM TO FORGIVE HER AND HAVE PITY ON HER
AND SHE TOO WAS OUT OF TEMPER AND DISINCLINED TO SPEAK
YOU MUST HAVE MEG SADDLED FOR ME AND BROUGHT TO THE DOOR AT HALF-PAST ELEVEN AND I SHALL WANT RATTLER SADDLED FOR PYM AT THE SAME TIME
HE SAYS COLLEGE MOSTLY MAKES PEOPLE LIKE BLADDERS--JUST GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT T HOLD THE STUFF AS IS POURED INTO EM
WE ARE OVERHASTY TO SPEAK--AS IF GOD DID NOT MANIFEST HIMSELF BY OUR SILENT FEELING AND MAKE HIS LOVE FELT THROUGH OURS
MEANWHILE ALL THE LESS DISTINGUISHED COUPLES HAD TAKEN THEIR PLACES
DINAH TOOK HER HAND NOW AND DREW IT UNDER HER OWN ARM
AND IT WAS THE ONLY WAY OF SATISFYING ADAM WHO MUST BE SATISFIED FOR MORE REASONS THAN ONE
I SHALL GO TO HIM BUT HE SHALL NOT RETURN TO ME EH THAT'S A TRUE WORD SAID LISBETH
THIS TO BE SURE WAS ONLY ANOTHER REASON FOR PERSEVERING IN HIS INTENTION AND GETTING AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY AGAINST HIMSELF
I ALLAYS SAID THAT O JUDITH AS SHE'D BEAR A POUND WEIGHT ANY DAY TO SAVE ANYBODY ELSE CARRYING A OUNCE
BUT WHEN YOU ARE AMONG THE FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT SUPERIORITY TO SIMPLE NATURAL PLEASURES
IN ADAM'S THERE WAS TREMBLING SUSPENSE IN MR IRWINE'S HESITATING SHRINKING PITY
I MET NOBODY FOR IT WAS VERY EARLY AND I GOT INTO THE WOOD....I KNEW THE WAY TO THE PLACE...THE PLACE AGAINST THE NUT-TREE
BUT IN THE NEXT SHE FELT AN ARM STEAL ROUND HER AND A GENTLE VOICE SAID WHY HETTY WHAT MAKES YOU CRY
YES SHE WOULD GET AWAY FROM WINDSOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND WHEN HE HAD HIS HAND ON THE DOOR-LATCH HE COULD SEE THROUGH THE CURTAINLESS WINDOW THAT THERE WERE EIGHT OR NINE HEADS BENDING OVER THE DESKS LIGHTED BY THIN DIPS
I HOPE TO SHOW IT THROUGH THE REST O MY LIFE IN MY ACTIONS THERE WERE VARIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT ADAM'S SPEECH
THEN A DEEP-BLUSHING ALMOST FRIGHTENED BUT BRIGHT-SMILING GIRL MAKING HER CURTSY WITH A FLUTTERED YET HAPPY GLANCE AS ARTHUR CAME UP TO HER
AN I LIKE A PINT WI MY PIPE AN A NEIGHBOURLY CHAT AT MESTER CASSON'S NOW AN THEN FOR I WAS BROUGHT UP I THE CHURCH THANK GOD AN HA BEEN A PARISH CLERK THIS TWO-AN'-THIRTY YEAR
SHALL I SIT DOWN WITH YOU WHILE YOU DO UP YOUR HAIR OH YES SAID HETTY HASTILY TURNING ROUND AND REACHING THE SECOND CHAIR IN THE ROOM GLAD THAT DINAH LOOKED AS IF SHE DID NOT NOTICE HER EAR-RINGS
THEN THEY TRAVELLED BACK AFFECTIONATELY OVER THE OLD SCENES OF BOYISH COMPANIONSHIP AND DWELT ON ARTHUR'S GOOD QUALITIES WHICH ADAM HAD A PRIDE IN AS WE ALL HAVE IN THE VIRTUES OF THE SUPERIOR WHO HONOURS US
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EARTH-BORN FOR WHAT SHE KNEW
HETTY'S HUSBAND HAD A SPECIAL CLAIM ON HIM--HETTY HERSELF SHOULD FEEL THAT ANY PAIN SHE HAD SUFFERED THROUGH ARTHUR IN THE PAST WAS COMPENSATED TO HER A HUNDREDFOLD
BUT THEY KNEW A FEW GOOD WORDS BY HEART AND THEIR WITHERED LIPS NOW AND THEN MOVED SILENTLY FOLLOWING THE SERVICE WITHOUT ANY VERY CLEAR COMPREHENSION INDEED BUT WITH A SIMPLE FAITH IN ITS EFFICACY TO WARD OFF HARM AND BRING BLESSING
HE NEVER SHOOK HANDS WITH ANY OF THE FARMERS AND ADAM FELT THE HONOUR KEENLY
HER YOUTH AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE A PLEA FOR HER AH AND IT'S RIGHT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW HOW SHE WAS TEMPTED INTO THE WRONG WAY SAID ADAM WITH BITTER EARNESTNESS
AND THERE IS SOMETHING SO HEALTHFUL IN THE SHARING OF A JOY THAT IS GENERAL AND NOT MERELY PERSONAL THAT THIS THOUGHT ABOUT THE HAY-HARVEST REACTS ON HIS STATE OF MIND AND MAKES HIS RESOLUTION SEEM AN EASIER MATTER
ADAM WITH AN AIR OF QUIET OBEDIENCE TOOK UP THE CUP AND DRANK A LITTLE
BUT I ASK NO QUESTIONS ABOUT IT--IT MAKES ME TOO ANGRY
I REMEMBER JACOB TAFT WALKING FIFTY MILE AFTER THE SCOTCH RAYBELS WHEN THEY TURNED BACK FROM STONITON HE FELT HIMSELF QUITE A YOUNGSTER WITH A LONG LIFE BEFORE HIM AS HE SAW THE HAYSLOPE PATRIARCH OLD FEYTHER TAFT DESCEND FROM THE WAGGON AND WALK TOWARDS HIM IN HIS BROWN NIGHTCAP AND LEANING ON HIS TWO STICKS
I WANT TO SEE A GENTLEMAN AS IS THERE SAID HETTY
THE DOCTORS EVIDENCE IS HEAVY ON HER--IS HEAVY
HER CHEEK WAS AGAINST DINAH'S
LET ME HAVE NO WILL BUT THINE LISBETH TURNED INTO THE HOUSE AT LAST AND SAT DOWN IN THE WORKSHOP NEAR SETH WHO WAS BUSYING HIMSELF THERE WITH FITTING SOME BITS OF TURNED WOOD HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE VILLAGE INTO A SMALL WORK-BOX WHICH HE MEANT TO GIVE TO DINAH BEFORE SHE WENT AWAY
A WEEK LAST MONDAY TOWARDS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I WAS GOING TOWARDS HETTON COPPICE AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE COPPICE I SAW THE PRISONER IN A RED CLOAK SITTING UNDER A BIT OF A HAYSTACK NOT FAR OFF THE STILE
FOR SETH'S GOT A LIKING FOR HER AND I HOPE SHE'LL GET A LIKING FOR SETH IN TIME WHERE'S TH USE O TALKIN A-THAT'N
AND WHEN I'VE PAID OFF A DEBT OR TWO I SHALL BE ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT ME YOU'RE VERY GOOD TO SAY SO SIR AND I'M NOT UNTHANKFUL
AND THOUGH ADAM HAD BEEN HARSH AND VIOLENT AND HAD THRUST ON HIM A PAINFUL DILEMMA THE POOR FELLOW WAS IN LOVE AND HAD REAL PROVOCATION
IN THE EVENING WHEN MR POYSER WAS SMOKING HIS PIPE AND HIS GOOD-NATURE WAS THEREFORE AT ITS SUPERLATIVE MOMENT HETTY SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF HER AUNT'S ABSENCE TO SAY UNCLE I WISH YOU'D LET ME GO FOR A LADY'S MAID MR POYSER TOOK THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH AND LOOKED AT HETTY IN MILD SURPRISE FOR SOME MOMENTS
HE WAS DROWNED LAST NIGHT IN THE WILLOW BROOK
THEY WERE THE COMMON ISSUE OF HIS WEAKNESSES AND GOOD QUALITIES OF HIS EGOISM AND HIS SYMPATHY
BUT HIS COLOUR'S CHANGED AND HE LOOKS SADLY
BUT THEN SIR FOLKS'S FEELINGS ARE NOT SO EASILY OVERCOME
IT'S ON'Y THE MARIGOLD I TH PARRIDGE ADAM HAD THRUST HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND WAS LOOKING DOWN AT THE BOOK ON THE TABLE WITHOUT SEEING ANY OF THE LETTERS
HE PERCEIVED THAT ADAM HAD NO POSITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST AND THAT THERE WAS NO IRREVOCABLE DAMAGE DONE BY THIS EVENING'S UNFORTUNATE RENCONTRE
AND THE FEELING WHICH MADE ADAM SHRINK FROM TELLING ANYTHING WHICH WAS HER SECRET MUST GIVE WAY BEFORE THE NEED THERE WAS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME ONE ELSE BESIDES HIMSELF WHO WOULD BE PREPARED TO DEFEND HER IN THE WORST EXTREMITY
I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DO MR OTTLEY'S INDEED
I'LL GO TO THE VILLAGE THIS FORENOON BECAUSE MR BURGE ULL WANT TO SEE ME AND SETH SHALL STAY AT HOME AND BEGIN THE COFFIN
SHE WENT MORE SLOWLY THAN SHE CAME OFTEN GETTING OVER THE STILES AND SITTING FOR HOURS UNDER THE HEDGEROWS LOOKING BEFORE HER WITH BLANK BEAUTIFUL EYES
HE USED TO BE A WILD DRUNKEN RASCAL NEGLECTING HIS WORK AND BEATING HIS WIFE THEY TOLD ME
YOU WUNNA FIT THEM TWO WI THE SAME LAST MAYBE SAID WIRY BEN CONTEMPTUOUSLY BUT SETH'S THE LAD FOR ME THOUGH HE WAR A METHODY TWICE O'ER
O GOD HOW SAD THEY LOOKED
IT WAS A SHOUT OF SUDDEN EXCITEMENT AT THE APPEARANCE OF A HORSEMAN CLEAVING THE CROWD AT FULL GALLOP
IT SEEMED AS IF HE HAD SAT DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES REST AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITHOUT SLIPPING FROM HIS FIRST ATTITUDE OF SAD FATIGUED THOUGHT
IT'S NO USE STARING ABOUT TO CATCH SIGHT OF A SOUND
FOR ANYBODY UD THINK YOU'D GOT THE ST VITUS'S DANCE TO SEE THE THINGS YOU'VE THROWED DOWN
IT WOULD BE EASY ENOUGH BY THE AID OF THE NICKS IN THE STONE PILLARS TO CLIMB OVER THE BRICK WALL WITH ITS SMOOTH STONE COPING
THESE PREACHING WOMEN ARE NOT SO BACK'ARD COMMONLY BARTLE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
RUN IN THIS MINUTE--THERE'S A GOOD LITTLE GIRL HE LIFTED HER UP IN HIS STRONG ARMS AND KISSED HER AS HE SPOKE A CEREMONY WHICH TOTTY REGARDED AS A TIRESOME INTERRUPTION TO CHERRY-EATING
SPEECH AND APPREHENSION THAT HETTY MIGHT BE AT SNOWFIELD AFTER ALL
AND THEN HE WON'T TAKE UP OTHER FOLKS ROOM
THERE'S PLENTY OF UNLOVING LOVE IN THE WORLD OF A MASCULINE KIND
RUN INTO THE DAIRY AND SEE COUSIN HETTY MAKE THE BUTTER I TOULD IKE A BIT O PUM-TAKE REJOINED TOTTY WHO SEEMED TO BE PROVIDED WITH SEVERAL RELAYS OF REQUESTS
SHE DID NOT SEEM TO BE FLIRTING AT ALL SHE SMILED LESS THAN USUAL
THEN I GIVE YOU UP ADAM BUT IT'S A WOMAN YOU'N SPOKE WELL ON BARTLE SAID MR POYSER
HERE ADAM SAID MRS POYSER WHO WAS STANDING AND LOOKING ON TO SEE THAT MOLLY AND NANCY DID THEIR DUTY AS WAITERS HERE'S A PLACE KEPT FOR YOU BETWEEN MR MASSEY AND THE BOYS
ON THE OTHER HAND I MUST PLEAD FOR I HAVE AN AFFECTIONATE PARTIALITY TOWARDS THE RECTOR'S MEMORY THAT HE WAS NOT VINDICTIVE--AND SOME PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE BEEN SO
AS IF IT COULD BE HETTY
YOU KNOW NOTHING DEAR HETTY OF THE WORLD IN WHICH I MUST ALWAYS LIVE AND YOU WOULD SOON BEGIN TO DISLIKE ME BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE SO LITTLE IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE ALIKE
HE HAD BECOME USED TO WATCHING HER LIGHT QUIET MOVEMENTS HER PRETTY LOVING WAYS TO THE CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO THE HALL FARM
HE'S GOT TO LOOK AFTER THE DRINKING AND THINGS
I CANNA SEE WHAT THEE'T DRIVING AT
THIAS BEDE WAS DROWNED LAST NIGHT IN THE WILLOW BROOK AND I'M THINKING THAT THE AGED MOTHER WILL BE GREATLY IN NEED OF COMFORT
IT SEEMS TO ME AS A WOMAN'S FACE DOESNA WANT FLOWERS
IF ANYTHING EVER GOES WRONG IT MUST BE THE HUSBAND'S FAULT THERE
FOR NONE OF THE OLD PEOPLE HELD BOOKS--WHY SHOULD THEY
BUT NOW SINCE THE PAST CANNOT BE ALTERED I AM BOUND TO SAVE YOU FROM ANY EVIL THAT I HAVE POWER TO PREVENT
AND WHEN THEY TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT HER SHE HUNG HER HEAD DOWN AND COWERED AND HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS
AND THEY ALL CAME ROUND ME OUT OF ALL THE COTTAGES AND MANY WEPT OVER THEIR SINS AND HAVE SINCE BEEN JOINED TO THE LORD
LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL THINK YOU WON'T FORGIVE ME ARTHUR HAD LAID HIS HAND ON THE SOFT ARM THAT WAS NEAREST TO HIM AND WAS STOOPING TOWARDS HETTY WITH A LOOK OF COAXING ENTREATY
DRINK SOME WINE NOW AND SHOW ME YOU MEAN TO BEAR IT LIKE A MAN BARTLE HAD MADE THE RIGHT SORT OF APPEAL
SHE HAD TALKED TO HER A GREAT DEAL IN A SERIOUS WAY BUT HETTY DIDN'T MIND THAT MUCH FOR SHE NEVER LISTENED
OUR FEET ARE QUITE DRY
AS ADAM'S CONFIDENCE WANED HIS PATIENCE WANED WITH IT AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF
I'LL TAKE EM IN NOW IT'S VERY WELL I CAME TO CARRY THE BASKET SAID ADAM FOR IT UD HA BEEN TOO HEAVY FOR YOUR LITTLE ARMS NO
IT'S A LITTLE DRAMA I'VE GOT UP IN HONOUR OF MY FRIEND ADAM
THEE'T LIKE THY DOG GYP--THEE BARK'ST AT ME SOMETIMES BUT THEE ALLAYS LICK'ST MY HAND AFTER ALL HANDS WORKED ON IN SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES UNTIL THE CHURCH CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE SIX
YOUR IMPATIENT LOQUACIOUS MAN HAS NEVER ANY NOTION OF KEEPING HIS PIPE ALIGHT BY GENTLE MEASURED PUFFS
THE CHILDREN SOON GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY OF LINGERING BEHIND A LITTLE AND THEN ADAM SAID
THE ROUND DOWNY CHICKS PEEPING OUT FROM UNDER THEIR MOTHER'S WING NEVER TOUCHED HETTY WITH ANY PLEASURE
THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME BECAUSE HE HATH ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR JESUS CHRIST SPOKE THOSE WORDS--HE SAID HE CAME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR
I SHALL TRUST TO YOUR GOOD SENSE NOW TO TAKE NO NOTICE AT ALL OF WHAT WILL MASKERY SAYS EITHER ABOUT YOU OR ME
THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER WITH A DEEP JOY
AND HE SAID SOLEMNLY TO ME AFTER THAT AS IT HAD BEEN ALL NONSENSE AND NO MORE THAN A BIT O FLIRTING
SO HERE HE WAS POINTING HIS BIG FINGER TOWARDS THREE WORDS AT ONCE AND TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE THAT HE MIGHT KEEP BETTER HOLD WITH HIS EYE OF THE ONE WORD WHICH WAS TO BE DISCRIMINATED OUT OF THE GROUP
IT'S HARD WORK TO TELL WHICH IS OLD HARRY WHEN EVERYBODY'S GOT BOOTS ON AS FOR THIS PEACE SAID MR POYSER TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE IN A DUBITATIVE MANNER AND GIVING A PRECAUTIONARY PUFF TO HIS PIPE BETWEEN EACH SENTENCE I DON'T KNOW
IT UD TAKE THEE ALL NIGHT TO DO'T WHAT SIGNIFIES HOW LONG IT TAKES ME
SHE FELT A REVIVAL OF HOPE AT THE MENTION OF A LETTER WHICH ADAM HAD NOT READ
HIS EYES ARE GREY
SO AS I'M AT THE FARM BEFORE DARK IT WILL BE QUITE SOON ENOUGH THANK YOU DINAH
NATURE HE KNOWS HAS A LANGUAGE OF HER OWN WHICH SHE USES WITH STRICT VERACITY AND HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF AN ADEPT IN THE LANGUAGE
SHE KEPT HOLD OF DINAH'S HAND BUT SHE WENT UP TO ADAM AND SAID TIMIDLY WILL YOU KISS ME AGAIN ADAM FOR ALL I'VE BEEN SO WICKED ADAM TOOK THE BLANCHED WASTED HAND SHE PUT OUT TO HIM AND THEY GAVE EACH OTHER THE SOLEMN UNSPEAKABLE KISS OF A LIFELONG PARTING
THE NATIVE IMPULSE TO GIVE TRUTH IN RETURN FOR TRUTH TO MEET TRUST WITH FRANK CONFESSION MUST BE SUPPRESSED AND DUTY WAS BECOMING A QUESTION OF TACTICS
YOUR LOT IS APPOINTED THERE BY A CLEAR SHOWING AND TO SEEK A GREATER BLESSING ELSEWHERE WOULD BE LIKE LAYING A FALSE OFFERING ON THE ALTAR AND EXPECTING THE FIRE FROM HEAVEN TO KINDLE IT
SO IT WOULD BE WELL NOT TO LET THE PERSONAL TONE OF THE CONVERSATION ALTOGETHER DROP
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WOOED BY A RIVER-GOD WHO MIGHT ANY TIME TAKE HER TO HIS WONDROUS HALLS BELOW A WATERY HEAVEN
HOWEVER THE DOCTORS SAY HE'LL SOON BE SET RIGHT IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AIR
IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE HETTY MIGHT COME BACK AND THE DISCLOSURE MIGHT BE AN INJURY OR AN OFFENCE TO HER
AND MOTHER ULL BE FINE AND JOYFUL ABOUT IT
BUT I THINK SHE WOULD FOR THE METHODISTS ARE GREAT FOLKS FOR GOING INTO THE PRISONS
SHE WENT BY MISTAKE TO STRATFORD-ON-AVON FINDING STRATFORD SET DOWN IN HER LIST OF PLACES AND THEN SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD COME A LONG WAY OUT OF THE RIGHT ROAD
LISBETH HAD A VAGUE BELIEF THAT THE PSALM WAS DOING HER HUSBAND GOOD
THE PARISH YOU CAN PERHAPS HARDLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF THAT WORD ON A MIND LIKE HETTY'S BROUGHT UP AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERE SOMEWHAT HARD IN THEIR FEELINGS EVEN TOWARDS POVERTY WHO LIVED AMONG THE FIELDS AND HAD LITTLE PITY FOR WANT AND RAGS AS A CRUEL INEVITABLE FATE SUCH AS THEY SOMETIMES SEEM IN CITIES BUT HELD THEM A MARK OF IDLENESS AND VICE--AND IT WAS IDLENESS AND VICE THAT BROUGHT BURDENS ON THE PARISH
HE NEVER OPENED IT ON A WEEKDAY AND SO HE CAME TO IT AS A HOLIDAY BOOK SERVING HIM FOR HISTORY BIOGRAPHY AND POETRY
HETTY'S SPHERE OF COMPARISON WAS NOT LARGE BUT SHE COULDN'T HELP PERCEIVING THAT ADAM WAS SOMETHING LIKE A MAN
CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE THOUGHT SO
THEE'T GI AWAY ALL THY EARNIN'S AN NIVER BE UNAISY AS THEE'ST NOTHIN LAID UP AGAIN A RAINY DAY
NATURE IS CLEVER ENOUGH TO CHEAT EVEN YOU MOTHER NONSENSE CHILD
THE CIRCLES UNDER HER EYES DEEPENED AS THEY DID WHEN TEARS HALF-GATHER WITHOUT FALLING
SO I TOOK CARE OF HER TO THE GATE AND ASKED FOR A KISS FOR MY PAINS
BUT THE FOLKS AT TH HALL FARM I WISH THEM NOT TO KNOW TILL I RETURN TO TELL THEM MYSELF
I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BY THE COACH
AN SHE'LL BE MISSIS O'ER ME AND I MUN LOOK ON BELIKE WHILE SHE USES THE BLUE-EDGED PLATTERS AND BREAKS EM MAYHAP THOUGH THERE'S NE'ER BEEN ONE BROKE SIN MY OLD MAN AN ME BOUGHT EM AT THE FAIR TWENTY EAR COME NEXT WHISSUNTIDE
YOU'RE READY I SEE DINAH ADAM SAID
NATURE SEEMS TO MAKE A HOT PAUSE JUST THEN
HOW'S THEE TO KNOW
I CAN'T TELL THEE WHERE I'M GOING AND THEE MUST SAY TO HER I'M GONE ON BUSINESS AS NOBODY IS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE FULLER THE CART THE BETTER BECAUSE THEN THE JOLTING WOULD NOT HURT SO MUCH AND NANCY'S BROAD PERSON AND THICK ARMS WERE AN EXCELLENT CUSHION TO BE PITCHED ON
SHE KNEW NO ROMANCES AND HAD ONLY A FEEBLE SHARE IN THE FEELINGS WHICH ARE THE SOURCE OF ROMANCE SO THAT WELL-READ LADIES MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HER STATE OF MIND
THE CAPTAIN SENT FOR ME T OFFER IT ME WHEN I WAS SEEING TO THE POLES AND THINGS HERE AND I'VE AGREED TO'T
IT'S THE RIGHT THING
HE SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF AFFAIRS AND INTERESTS TO FILL HIS LIFE NOW AND NOT BE IN DANGER OF PLAYING THE FOOL AGAIN
FOR THE BIBLE TELLS US WE MUST BE WORKERS TOGETHER WITH GOD WELL HOW'M I TO KNOW
I MUST GO AND SEE IF I CAN GIVE HER ANY HELP AS SHE ROSE AND WAS BEGINNING TO FOLD UP HER WORK CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL PLAUSIBLE PRETEXTS FOR REMAINING AMONG THE MILK-PANS CAME OUT OF THE DAIRY FOLLOWED BY MRS POYSER
I DARESAY HE WANTS A MAN WHO CAN PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE BUSINESS
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT IT
THEN THEY NAILED HIM UP
CAPTAIN MY NEIGHBOURS HAVE PUT IT UPO ME TO SPEAK FOR EM TO-DAY FOR WHERE FOLKS THINK PRETTY MUCH ALIKE ONE SPOKESMAN'S AS GOOD AS A SCORE
THERE MAY WELL BE STREAKY BUTTER I THE MARKET
COULD YOU TAKE ME UP IN YOUR WAGGON IF YOU'RE GOING TOWARDS ASHBY SAID HETTY
ON THE DOOR-STONE STOOD A CLEAN OLD WOMAN IN A DARK-STRIPED LINEN GOWN A RED KERCHIEF AND A LINEN CAP TALKING TO SOME SPECKLED FOWLS WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DRAWN TOWARDS HER BY AN ILLUSORY EXPECTATION OF COLD POTATOES OR BARLEY
SHE THOUGHT OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN FOUND AGAINST THE CHURCH WALL AT HAYSLOPE ONE SUNDAY NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD AND HUNGER--A TINY INFANT IN HER ARMS
I HOPE YOU WILL BE READY FOR A GREAT HOLIDAY ON THE THIRTIETH OF JULY MRS POYSER SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE WHEN HE HAD SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRED THE DAIRY AND GIVEN SEVERAL IMPROVISED OPINIONS ON SWEDE TURNIPS AND SHORTHORNS
IT DOT NOTIN IN IT SHE SAID AS SHE LOOKED DOWN AT IT VERY EARNESTLY
I THINK SHE'S DISAPPOINTED
THERE'S A GOOD DEAL O SENSE IN WHAT YOU SAY MR MASSEY ADAM BEGAN AS SOON AS HE FELT QUITE SERIOUS AS THERE ALWAYS IS
THAT UD BE UNREASONABLE
THE SIMPLE THINGS SHE SAID SEEMED LIKE NOVELTIES AS A MELODY STRIKES US WITH A NEW FEELING WHEN WE HEAR IT SUNG BY THE PURE VOICE OF A BOYISH CHORISTER
IT WAS THE HUMAN CONTACT SHE CLUNG TO BUT SHE WAS NOT THE LESS SINKING INTO THE DARK GULF
IT WAS NOT VERY LONG HARDLY MORE THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE KNOCK WHICH TOLD THAT THE JURY HAD COME TO THEIR DECISION FELL AS A SIGNAL FOR SILENCE ON EVERY EAR
WE SHOULD THINK NO MORE ABOUT OLD FRIENDS THAN WE DO ABOUT NEW UNS THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BROXTON I SUPPOSE SAID ARTHUR PUTTING HIS HORSE ON AT A SLOW PACE WHILE ADAM WALKED BY HIS SIDE
MISS MARY'S I TH HOUSE AND MESTER BURGE ULL BE BACK ANON
THERE WAS A TINGE OF SADNESS IN HIS DEEP JOY
BUT SHE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
THAT BLUSH MADE HIS HEART BEAT WITH A NEW HAPPINESS
WHAT'S AGE GOT TO DO WITH IT I WONDER
FOR IT COMES OVER YOU SOMETIMES AS IF SHE'D A WAY O KNOWING THE RIGHTS O THINGS MORE NOR OTHER FOLKS HAVE
EH SHE WENT ON STILL LOUDER AS SHE CAUGHT UP HER KNITTING FROM THE TABLE BUT SHE'LL NE'ER KNIT THE LAD'S STOCKIN'S NOR FOOT EM NAYTHER WHILE I LIVE
I MUST BID YOU GOOD-MORNING AS YOU'RE GOING TO THE RECTORY GOOD-BYE ADAM GOOD-BYE ARTHUR GAVE HIS HORSE TO THE GROOM AT THE RECTORY GATE AND WALKED ALONG THE GRAVEL TOWARDS THE DOOR WHICH OPENED ON THE GARDEN
BUT I SAY IT ISNA RELIGION TO BE SO OBSTINATE--IS IT NOW ADAM ADAM SAW THAT DINAH WAS MORE DISTURBED THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN HER BY ANY MATTER RELATING TO HERSELF AND ANXIOUS TO RELIEVE HER IF POSSIBLE HE SAID LOOKING AT HER AFFECTIONATELY NAY I CAN'T FIND FAULT WITH ANYTHING DINAH DOES
AND THE HUSBAND WILL LOOK ON SMILING BENIGNLY ABLE WHENEVER HE CHOOSES TO WITHDRAW INTO THE SANCTUARY OF HIS WISDOM TOWARDS WHICH HIS SWEET WIFE WILL LOOK REVERENTLY AND NEVER LIFT THE CURTAIN
SO WAS THE QUARRY FLOOR
TIM THINKING SLIGHTLY OF DAVID'S VOCALIZATION WAS IMPELLED TO SUPERSEDE THAT FEEBLE BUZZ BY A SPIRITED COMMENCEMENT OF THREE MERRY MOWERS BUT DAVID WAS NOT TO BE PUT DOWN SO EASILY AND SHOWED HIMSELF CAPABLE OF A COPIOUS CRESCENDO WHICH WAS RENDERING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE ROSE WOULD NOT PREDOMINATE OVER THE MOWERS WHEN OLD KESTER WITH AN ENTIRELY UNMOVED AND IMMOVABLE ASPECT SUDDENLY SET UP A QUAVERING TREBLE--AS IF HE HAD BEEN AN ALARUM AND THE TIME WAS COME FOR HIM TO GO OFF
BUT IT WAS VERY HARD FOR HIM
ADAM AS HE PRESSED HER ARM TO HIS SIDE WALKED WITH HIS OLD ERECTNESS AND HIS HEAD THROWN RATHER BACKWARD AS IF TO FACE ALL THE WORLD BETTER
MISS KATE CAME TOWARDS HER BROTHER AND WHISPERED DON'T SPEAK TO HER
SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MR IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
OLD MR DONNITHORNE THE DELICATELY CLEAN FINELY SCENTED WITHERED OLD MAN LED OUT MISS IRWINE WITH HIS AIR OF PUNCTILIOUS ACID POLITENESS
BUT TO-DAY ALL THOSE SHADOWS HAD FLED AND NOT A SOUL IN THE VAST HALL FELT THE PRESENCE OF ANY BUT A LIVING SORROW WHICH WAS QUIVERING IN WARM HEARTS
BUT ANYBODY BESIDES YOURSELF UD MIND ABOUT SUCH THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM AS THINK A DEAL MORE OF YOU THAN YOU DESERVE
AND I SAW IT WAS A LITTLE BABY'S HAND AT THESE WORDS A THRILL RAN THROUGH THE COURT
THEE WART ALLAYS FOR HALVING IVERYTHING WI HIM
I KNOW YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOUR LEASE RENEWED FOR THREE YEARS WHEN THE PRESENT ONE EXPIRES
AN AS FOR THE RECTOR'S COMPANY IT'S WELL KNOWN AS THAT'S WELCOME T ALL THE PARISH WHEREVER HE MAY BE
THE HAIR WAS DRAWN STRAIGHT BACK BEHIND THE EARS AND COVERED EXCEPT FOR AN INCH OR TWO ABOVE THE BROW BY A NET QUAKER CAP
MR MASSEY BROUGHT ME WORD YESTERDAY AS YOU WAS COME THEY COULD NEITHER OF THEM SAY ANY MORE JUST YET BUT STOOD BEFORE EACH OTHER IN SILENCE
IT'S ONLY WHEN ONE UD HAVE YOU DO WHAT'S PLAIN COMMON SENSE AND GOOD FOR YOURSELF AS YOU'RE OBSTINATE TH OTHER WAY NAY DEAR AUNT SAID DINAH SMILING SLIGHTLY AS SHE WENT ON WITH HER WORK I'M SURE YOUR WISH UD BE A REASON FOR ME TO DO ANYTHING THAT I DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS WRONG TO DO WRONG
COME CHARGE YOUR GLASSES AND LET US DRINK TO OUR EXCELLENT RECTOR--THREE TIMES THREE THIS TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH ALL THE ENTHUSIASM THAT WAS WANTING TO THE LAST AND IT CERTAINLY WAS THE MOST PICTURESQUE MOMENT IN THE SCENE WHEN MR IRWINE GOT UP TO SPEAK AND ALL THE FACES IN THE ROOM WERE TURNED TOWARDS HIM
I CAME TO HEAR YOU SPEAK NOT TO TALK MYSELF--IF YOU'LL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO TELL ME WHAT THE POOR LAD'S DOING DON'T PUT YOURSELF UNDER ANY RESTRAINT BARTLE SAID MR IRWINE
ADAM DELIGHTED IN A FINE TREE OF ALL THINGS
BUT THIS EVENING AS HE GLANCES OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT BILL DOWNES THE SAWYER WHO IS TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A DESPERATE SENSE OF BLANKNESS BEFORE THE LETTERS D-R-Y HIS EYES SHED THEIR MILDEST AND MOST ENCOURAGING LIGHT
IT'LL BE A SORE TIME FOR TH HAYMAKING IF THE MEADOWS ARE FLOODED AGAIN
THE SWEET LIPS WERE PALLID AND HALF-OPEN AND QUIVERING
BUT I'LL GO HOME WHEN I'VE TAKEN THIS DOSE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE BEFORE ADAM SAID MY TEMPER GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND I SAID THINGS AS WASN'T TRUE
BUT HE HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEYOND THE ROSES WHEN HE HEARD THE SHAKING OF A BOUGH AND A BOY'S VOICE SAYING NOW THEN TOTTY HOLD OUT YOUR PINNY--THERE'S A DUCK THE VOICE CAME FROM THE BOUGHS OF A TALL CHERRY-TREE WHERE ADAM HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCERNING A SMALL BLUE-PINAFORED FIGURE PERCHED IN A COMMODIOUS POSITION WHERE THE FRUIT WAS THICKEST
THERE IS A FIGURE WE KNOW WELL JUST COME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HANDS AS SHE LOOKS FOR SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE FOR THE RAYS THAT FALL ON HER WHITE BORDERLESS CAP AND HER PALE AUBURN HAIR ARE VERY DAZZLING
I'D MAKE A SHIFT AND FEND INDOOR AND OUT TO GIVE YOU MORE LIBERTY--MORE THAN YOU CAN HAVE NOW FOR YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR OWN LIVING NOW AND I'M STRONG ENOUGH TO WORK FOR US BOTH WHEN SETH HAD ONCE BEGUN TO URGE HIS SUIT HE WENT ON EARNESTLY AND ALMOST HURRIEDLY LEST DINAH SHOULD SPEAK SOME DECISIVE WORD BEFORE HE HAD POURED FORTH ALL THE ARGUMENTS HE HAD PREPARED
TH WAR'S A FINE THING FOR THE COUNTRY AN HOW'LL YOU KEEP UP PRICES WI'OUT IT
YOU CAN'T MAKE EM DO ANYTHING
REMEMBER MR IRWINE WENT ON THERE ARE OTHERS TO THINK OF AND ACT FOR BESIDES YOURSELF ADAM
SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION
BUT I'VE NOTICED THAT IN THESE VILLAGES WHERE THE PEOPLE LEAD A QUIET LIFE AMONG THE GREEN PASTURES AND THE STILL WATERS TILLING THE GROUND AND TENDING THE CATTLE THERE'S A STRANGE DEADNESS TO THE WORD AS DIFFERENT AS CAN BE FROM THE GREAT TOWNS LIKE LEEDS WHERE I ONCE WENT TO VISIT A HOLY WOMAN WHO PREACHES THERE
IT MAKES YOU FEEL THE WORLD'S A BIG PLACE AND THERE'S OTHER MEN WORKING IN IT WITH THEIR HEADS AND HANDS BESIDES YOURSELF I LIKE TH HILLS BEST SAID SETH WHEN THE CLOUDS ARE OVER YOUR HEAD AND YOU SEE THE SUN SHINING EVER SO FAR OFF OVER THE LOAMFORD WAY AS I'VE OFTEN DONE O LATE ON THE STORMY DAYS
WOULD THE LAD BE HURT
INGENIOUS PHILOSOPHERS TELL YOU PERHAPS THAT THE GREAT WORK OF THE STEAM-ENGINE IS TO CREATE LEISURE FOR MANKIND
AYE AS VINEGAR MATCHES ONE'S TEETH
MR IRWINE IS TO BE A WITNESS HIMSELF BY AND BY ON HER SIDE YOU KNOW TO SPEAK TO HER CHARACTER AND BRINGING UP BUT THE OTHER EVIDENCE...DOES IT GO HARD AGAINST HER SAID ADAM
I'M TURNING OVER A LITTLE PLAN FOR SETH AND ME TO GO INTO THE CABINET-MAKING A BIT BY OURSELVES AND WIN A EXTRA POUND OR TWO IN THAT WAY
IT'LL SERVE YOU TO TALK ON HETTY WHEN YOU'RE AN OLD WOMAN--HOW YOU DANCED WI TH YOUNG SQUIRE THE DAY HE COME O AGE BOOK FOUR CHAPTER XXVII A CRISIS IT WAS BEYOND THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST--NEARLY THREE WEEKS AFTER THE BIRTHDAY FEAST
BUT SINCE THEN I'VE SEEN PRETTY CLEAR AS TH OLD SQUIRE CAN'T ABIDE ME THAT'S LIKELY ENOUGH THAT'S LIKELY ENOUGH SAID BARTLE MEDITATIVELY
LUKE BRITTON COULD NOT MAKE A REMARK EVEN ON THE WEATHER BUT MARTIN POYSER DETECTED IN IT A TAINT OF THAT UNSOUNDNESS AND GENERAL IGNORANCE WHICH WAS PALPABLE IN ALL HIS FARMING OPERATIONS
AND YET IT WAS A RELIEF TO HIM THAT ADAM REOPENED THE SUBJECT IN A WAY THE LEAST DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ANSWER
BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE DONKEY MIND LIES IN ADOPTING A COURSE INVERSELY AS THE ARGUMENTS URGED WHICH WELL CONSIDERED REQUIRES AS GREAT A MENTAL FORCE AS THE DIRECT SEQUENCE
IT'LL BE A STIFF WALK HOME FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING TO REVIVE YOU YES--GO
AND HERE MUST I TAKE THE BROWN-AND-WHITE JUG AS IT'S NIVER BEEN USED THREE TIMES THIS YEAR AND GO DOWN I THE CELLAR MYSELF AND BELIKE CATCH MY DEATH AND BE LAID UP WI INFLAMMATION MRS POYSER HAD TURNED ROUND FROM THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BROWN-AND-WHITE JUG IN HER HAND WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING AT THE OTHER END OF THE KITCHEN
BECAUSE YOU WON'T HAVE HIM TO BE YOUR SAVIOUR HE WILL BE YOUR JUDGE
THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS DID DOUBLE WORK IN EVERY FARMHOUSE THAT THE MAIDS MIGHT GIVE THEIR HELP IN TOSSING THE HAY
YET HE COULDN'T HELP LIKING TO LOOK AT HER AND LISTEN TO HER THOUGH HE DREADED EVERY MOMENT THAT SHE WOULD FIX HER EYES ON HIM AND ADDRESS HIM IN PARTICULAR
BUT THEE MUSTNA UNDERVALLY PRAYER
YET WHILE THIS SELFISH TUMULT WAS GOING ON IN HER SOUL HER EYES WERE BENT DOWN ON HER PRAYER-BOOK AND THE EYELIDS WITH THEIR DARK FRINGE LOOKED AS LOVELY AS EVER
WILL'T BE--WHAT COME YE OUT FOR TO SEE
I'VE HAD ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR
IS IT ANYBODY YE'VE HEARED ON AT SNOWFIELD DID THERE COME NO YOUNG WOMAN HERE--VERY YOUNG AND PRETTY--FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT TO SEE DINAH MORRIS NAY
SHE WAS EAGER NOT TO LOSE THIS EVENING'S OPPORTUNITY
HETTY HAD BEEN DECEIVING HERSELF IN THINKING THAT SHE COULD LOVE AND MARRY HIM
POYSER WOULDN'T LIKE TO HEAR AS HIS WIFE'S NIECE WAS TREATED ANY WAYS DISRESPECTFUL FOR ALL HE MAYN'T BE FOND OF HER TAKING ON HERSELF TO PREACH AYE AN SHE'S A PLEASANT-LOOKED UN TOO SAID WIRY BEN
FEAR AND TREMBLING HAVE TAKEN HOLD ON HER BUT SHE TREMBLES ONLY AT THE PAIN AND DEATH OF THE BODY
I SEE HOW IT IS WELL ENOUGH
BUT A GREAT FEAR IS UPON ME
HE'S ALL SOUND IN TH INSIDE
BUT THERE'S SOME MEN CAN DO WI'OUT THAT--THEY THINK SO MUCH O THEMSELVES A'READY
WILL YOU TELL ME THE WAY TO THE NEAREST VILLAGE SHE GOT UP AS SHE WAS SPEAKING AND PUT HER HANDS TO HER BONNET TO ADJUST IT AND THEN LAID HOLD OF HER BASKET
DO TAKE NOTICE OF HER TO BE SURE I WILL SAID THE OLD LADY GIVING A GRACIOUS BOW TO MRS POYSER
THAT POOR SICKLY MISS ANNE--HE SEEMED TO THINK MORE OF HER THAN OF ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD
ALICK TOO WAS COME IN AND WAS SEATED IN HIS FAR CORNER EATING COLD BROAD BEANS OUT OF A LARGE DISH WITH HIS POCKET-KNIFE AND FINDING A FLAVOUR IN THEM WHICH HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXCHANGED FOR THE FINEST PINEAPPLE
WHAT DOST SAY SUCH THINGS FOR MOTHER WHEN THEE'ST GOT NO FOUNDATION FOR EM
BUT ALREADY SOMETHING BITTER HAD BEGUN TO MINGLE ITSELF WITH THE FOUNTAIN OF SWEETS
BUT FOR THE MATTER O THAT IT'S THE FLESH AND BLOOD FOLKS ARE MADE ON AS MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
I KNOW WHAT BELONGS TO BEIN A PARISH CLERK AND I KNOW AS I SHOULD BE WANTIN I RESPECT TO YOUR REVERENCE AN CHURCH AN KING IF I WAS T ALLOW SUCH GOINS-ON WI'OUT SPEAKIN I WAS TOOK BY SURPRISE AN KNOWED NOTHIN ON IT BEFOREHAND AN I WAS SO FLUSTERED I WAS CLEAN AS IF I'D LOST MY TOOLS
LET A WOMAN SAY WHAT SHE WILL AFTER SHE HAS ONCE TOLD A MAN THAT SHE LOVES HIM HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND
CHAD CRANAGE LIFTED UP HIS LEATHER SKULL-CAP AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD
BUT THEE'T ALLAYS SO HARD UPO THY FEYTHER ADAM
SHE HAS GOT A BEAUTIFUL PAIR OF GOLD AND PEARLS AND GARNET LYING SNUGLY IN A PRETTY LITTLE BOX LINED WITH WHITE SATIN
AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT HER NOT DECEIVING HERSELF
ADAM WAS AT THE DOOR WITHOUT THE LOSS OF A MOMENT
I NEVER SAW THE LIKE TO YOU DINAH MRS POYSER WAS SAYING WHEN YOU'VE ONCE TOOK ANYTHING INTO YOUR HEAD
THEY WERE BUILDING A COTTON-MILL THERE
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN A WET MORNING MR IRWINE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE DINING-ROOM PLAYING AT CHESS WITH HIS MOTHER AND HE LOVES BOTH HIS MOTHER AND CHESS QUITE WELL ENOUGH TO PASS SOME CLOUDY HOURS VERY EASILY BY THEIR HELP
BUT SHE'S GONE--GONE AWAY FROM US
MICHAELMAS WAS COME WITH ITS FRAGRANT BASKETFULS OF PURPLE DAMSONS AND ITS PALER PURPLE DAISIES AND ITS LADS AND LASSES LEAVING OR SEEKING SERVICE AND WINDING ALONG BETWEEN THE YELLOW HEDGES WITH THEIR BUNDLES UNDER THEIR ARMS
DON'T THINK I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I COULD
IT WAS THE SAME ROUNDED POUTING CHILDISH PRETTINESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE AND BELIEF IN LOVE DEPARTED FROM IT--THE SADDER FOR ITS BEAUTY LIKE THAT WONDROUS MEDUSA-FACE WITH THE PASSIONATE PASSIONLESS LIPS
WE'RE NOT FRIENDS AN IT'S BETTER NOT TO PRETEND IT
THOUGH FOR THE MATTER O THAT THERE'S PEOPLE WI LIGHT HAIR AN BLUE EYES AS PRETTY AS THEM WI BLACK
BUT I CANNOT POSITIVELY SAY WHETHER THESE ALONE HAD SUFFICED TO INSPIRE HIM WITH THE RICH CHANT IN WHICH HE DELIVERED THE RESPONSES
IT WAS A WOMAN'S LITTLE PINK SILK NECKERCHIEF
FOR WE KNOW EVERYTHING COMES FROM GOD
SHE'S NOUGHT BUT TH OLD HUSK AND THEE'ST SLIPPED AWAY FROM HER LIKE THE RIPE NUT WELL MOTHER SAID ADAM I'LL GO AND TELL THE CAPTAIN AS IT HURTS THY FEELINGS FOR ME TO STAY AND I'D RATHER GO HOME UPO THAT ACCOUNT
THE BROAD STEPS OF THE STONE STAIRCASE WERE COVERED WITH CUSHIONS TO SERVE AS SEATS FOR THE CHILDREN WHO WERE TO STAY TILL HALF-PAST NINE WITH THE SERVANT-MAIDS TO SEE THE DANCING AND AS THIS DANCE WAS CONFINED TO THE CHIEF TENANTS THERE WAS ABUNDANT ROOM FOR EVERY ONE
THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED TO SAVE ME FROM IT
AND I TURNED OUT OF THE ROAD INTO THE FIELDS FOR I WAS AFRAID O MEETING ANYBODY WITH THE MOON SHINING ON ME
SHE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM TO ME ALMOST ALL THE DAY
BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER THIS VIEW OF THE CASE HAD BECOME SO CLEAR TO ADAM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY
ADAM TRIED NOT TO THINK WHERE THEY WERE GOING AS THEY HURRIED PAST HIM IN THAT SHORT SPACE BETWEEN HIS LODGING AND THE PRISON GATES
THEY'RE THE FIELD'S LENGTH BEHIND US
BUT THERE WAS A HOLE LEFT IN ONE PLACE AND I COULD SEE DOWN IT AND SEE THE CHILD'S HEAD
IT WILL BE MY WISH TO BE LOOKED ON BY ALL MY DESERVING TENANTS AS THEIR BEST FRIEND AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME SO HAPPY AS TO BE ABLE TO RESPECT EVERY MAN ON THE ESTATE AND TO BE RESPECTED BY HIM IN RETURN
HETTY'S DREAM OF THE FUTURE COULD NOT MAKE HER INSENSIBLE TO TRIUMPH IN THE PRESENT
BUT DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I SHALL NOT ALWAYS CARE FOR YOU--ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO YOU--ALWAYS REMEMBER MY HETTY
ARTHUR DONNITHORNE ACCEPTED HIS OWN BOND FOR HIMSELF WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE
IT WAS A SPECIAL OCCASION FOR AN OLD MAN FAMILIAR TO ALL THE PARISH HAD DIED A SAD DEATH--NOT IN HIS BED A CIRCUMSTANCE THE MOST PAINFUL TO THE MIND OF THE PEASANT--AND NOW THE FUNERAL PSALM WAS TO BE SUNG IN MEMORY OF HIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE
I ALLAYS WANTED TO HA LADS AS COULD FEND FOR THEIRSENS
THEE'ST BEEN JUST THE SAME E'ER SIN YE WAR LITTLE UNS TOGETHER
BUT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO DIE WITH SHAME VEXATION AND FRIGHT IF HER AUNT HAD THIS MOMENT OPENED THE DOOR AND SEEN HER WITH HER BITS OF CANDLE LIGHTED AND STRUTTING ABOUT DECKED IN HER SCARF AND EAR-RINGS
SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM--HAD SET OFF DIRECTLY AFTER MORNING CHAPEL TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
WE COULD PLAN NO END OF REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER
BUT HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR AGAIN DIRECTLY SAYING MORE FEEBLY YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT IN SUSPECTING ME YOU ARE CASTING IMPUTATIONS UPON HER NAY SIR ADAM SAID IN A CALMER VOICE AS IF HE WERE HALF-RELIEVED--FOR HE WAS TOO STRAIGHTFORWARD TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A DIRECT FALSEHOOD AND AN INDIRECT ONE--"NAY SIR THINGS DON'T LIE LEVEL BETWEEN HETTY AND YOU
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE REMEMBERED WITHOUT INDIFFERENCE THE AFFECTIONATE KINDNESS DINAH HAD SHOWN HER AND THOSE WORDS OF DINAH IN THE BED-CHAMBER--THAT HETTY MUST THINK OF HER AS A FRIEND IN TROUBLE
HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE
WHEN ALICK HAD GONE SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH THIS TEST OF STEADY-HANDED MANLINESS IT WAS THE TURN OF OLD KESTER AT HIS RIGHT HAND--AND SO ON TILL EVERY MAN HAD DRUNK HIS INITIATORY PINT UNDER THE STIMULUS OF THE CHORUS
ADAM WAS NOT IN HIS USUAL PLACE AMONG THE SINGERS TO-DAY FOR HE SAT WITH HIS MOTHER AND SETH AND HE NOTICED WITH SURPRISE THAT BARTLE MASSEY WAS ABSENT TOO--ALL THE MORE AGREEABLE FOR MR JOSHUA RANN WHO GAVE OUT HIS BASS NOTES WITH UNUSUAL COMPLACENCY AND THREW AN EXTRA RAY OF SEVERITY INTO THE GLANCES HE SENT OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT THE RECUSANT WILL MASKERY
I THINK IT WAS HIS PEDIGREE ONLY THAT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING SCOTCH AND NOT HIS BRINGING UP
FOR SHE'S MY OWN SISTER'S CHILD AND IT BEHOVES ME TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR HER
PEOPLE ULL BE WONDERING TO SEE ME THERE AND THEY'LL LIKE ENOUGH BE GUESSING THE REASON AND ASKING QUESTIONS FOR THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK UP AND DOWN ABOUT MY HAVING THE PLACE THIS LAST THREE WEEKS WELL THEE CANST SAY THEE WAST ORDERED TO COME WITHOUT BEING TOLD THE REASON
HE MUST HAVE SEEN THEM KISSING SHE KNEW BUT SHE HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE SCENE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN ARTHUR AND ADAM
THE OLD PSALM-TUNES HAVE MANY A WAIL AMONG THEM AND THE WORDS THOU SWEEP'ST US OFF AS WITH A FLOOD
SETH SAT THERE TOO THIS EVENING FOR HE KNEW HIS MOTHER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DINAH ALL TO HERSELF
THEE THINK'ST NOTHING TOO MUCH TO DO FOR SETH
AND YOU KNEW NO MORE O WHAT BELONGS TO WORK WHEN YOU COME HERE THAN THE MAWKIN I THE FIELD
NO ARMS COULD BE PRETTIER DOWN TO A LITTLE WAY BELOW THE ELBOW--THEY WERE WHITE AND PLUMP AND DIMPLED TO MATCH HER CHEEKS
FOR IF OLD HARRY WANTS ANY WORK DONE YOU MAY BE SURE HE'LL FIND THE MEANS NONSENSE ABOUT MURDERING US IN OUR BEDS SAID MR POYSER
WHENCE I FEAR THE TRAGEDY OF HUMAN LIFE IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IN SPITE OF MENTAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO ARE READY WITH THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR AVOIDING ALL MISTAKES OF THE KIND
FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE OFTEN HEARD MR GEDGE THE LANDLORD OF THE ROYAL OAK WHO USED TO TURN A BLOODSHOT EYE ON HIS NEIGHBOURS IN THE VILLAGE OF SHEPPERTON SUM UP HIS OPINION OF THE PEOPLE IN HIS OWN PARISH--AND THEY WERE ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNEW--IN THESE EMPHATIC WORDS
AND NOW THE LITTLE PROCESSION SET OFF
HOW IT WOULD GROAN AND GRATE AGAINST THE STONE FLOOR IF IT WERE
I MUST HAVE IT UP AT THE TURNING-SHOP IN THE VILLAGE AND DO IT THERE FOR I'VE NO CONVENENCE FOR TURNING AT HOME
AND WHILE THEY WERE BENDING TO KISS GYP WHO HAD BEEN RUNNING AMONG THE BRUSHWOOD CAME OUT CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM AND GAVE A SHARP BARK
AND SO SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH THE LARGE EAR-RINGS IN HER EARS AND THE BLACK LACE SCARF ADJUSTED ROUND HER SHOULDERS
THE SENSE OF FAMILY DISHONOUR WAS TOO KEEN EVEN IN THE KIND-HEARTED MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER TO LEAVE ROOM FOR ANY COMPASSION TOWARDS HETTY
HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
AS SHE HELD OUT THE SHILLING SHE LIFTED UP HER DARK TEAR-FILLED EYES TO THE COACHMAN'S FACE AND SAID CAN YOU GIVE ME BACK SIXPENCE NO NO HE SAID GRUFFLY NEVER MIND--PUT THE SHILLING UP AGAIN THE LANDLORD OF THE GREEN MAN HAD STOOD NEAR ENOUGH TO WITNESS THIS SCENE AND HE WAS A MAN WHOSE ABUNDANT FEEDING SERVED TO KEEP HIS GOOD NATURE AS WELL AS HIS PERSON IN HIGH CONDITION
FACILE NATURES WHOSE EMOTIONS HAVE LITTLE PERMANENCE CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH INWARD RESISTANCE HE OVERCAME BEFORE HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT AND TURNED TOWARDS ARTHUR
THEN CAME THE MOMENT OF THE FINAL BLESSING WHEN THE FOREVER SUBLIME WORDS THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSETH ALL UNDERSTANDING SEEMED TO BLEND WITH THE CALM AFTERNOON SUNSHINE THAT FELL ON THE BOWED HEADS OF THE CONGREGATION
AUNT WANTS ME TO LEAVE SOME ON THE TREES
THE MEMORY OF THAT HAD STILL A CHARM FOR HER THOUGH IT WAS NO MORE THAN A SOOTHING DRAUGHT THAT JUST MADE PAIN BEARABLE
AN NOUGHT SHALL MA ME BELIEVE AS GOD DIDNA MAKE HER AN SEND HER THERE O PURPOSE FOR THEE
THAT DOESN'T ALTER TH EVIL
THERE WASN'T A SOUL IN THE PARISH HAD A WORD TO SAY AGAINST HIM
THE NOBLEST NATURE SEES THE MOST OF THIS IMPERSONAL EXPRESSION IN BEAUTY IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THERE ARE GENTLEMEN WITH WHISKERS DYED AND UNDYED WHO SEE NONE OF IT WHATEVER AND FOR THIS REASON THE NOBLEST NATURE IS OFTEN THE MOST BLINDED TO THE CHARACTER OF THE ONE WOMAN'S SOUL THAT THE BEAUTY CLOTHES
EVEN MRS POYSER COULD NOT TRUST HERSELF TO SPEAK AS THE NEIGHBOURS SHOOK HANDS WITH HER AND LISBETH BEGAN TO CRY IN THE FACE OF THE VERY FIRST PERSON WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS GETTING YOUNG AGAIN
AND IT IS BEST TO FIX OUR MINDS ON THAT CERTAINTY INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING WHAT MAY BE THE ELEMENTS OF EXCUSE FOR US
MOREOVER THE STRANGER'S EYE DETECTS WHAT THE FAMILIAR UNSUSPECTING EYE LEAVES UNNOTICED
AN WHEN THEE'ST GOT THY FACE WASHED AS CLEAN AS THE SMOOTH WHITE PIBBLE AN THY HAIR COMBED SO NICE AND THY EYES A-SPARKLIN'--WHAT ELSE IS THERE AS THY OLD MOTHER SHOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT HALF SO WELL
HER GREY HAIR IS TURNED NEATLY BACK UNDER A PURE LINEN CAP WITH A BLACK BAND ROUND IT
BUT OBSERVING THE CESSATION OF THE TOOLS HE LOOKED UP AND SAID IN A TONE OF INDIGNATION LOOK THERE NOW
YOU MUST MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR TO YOUR MIND WHICH YOU ARE MOST BENT UPON OLD BOY--POPULARITY OR USEFULNESS--ELSE YOU MAY HAPPEN TO MISS BOTH OH
BUT SOMETHING MAY BE DONE AND YOU CAN HELP ME
DON'T LET US DELAY COME THEN SAID THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN RINGING AND GAINING ADMISSION I KNOW YOU HAVE A KEY TO UNLOCK HEARTS DINAH MECHANICALLY TOOK OFF HER BONNET AND SHAWL AS SOON AS THEY WERE WITHIN THE PRISON COURT FROM THE HABIT SHE HAD OF THROWING THEM OFF WHEN SHE PREACHED OR PRAYED OR VISITED THE SICK
I DON'T FORGET WHAT'S OWING TO YOU AS A GENTLEMAN BUT IN THIS THING WE'RE MAN AND MAN AND I CAN'T GIVE UP THERE WAS NO ANSWER FOR SOME MOMENTS
THAT'S A SURE SIGN O FAIR WEATHER--THERE'S A MANY AS IS FALSE BUT THAT'S SURE AYE AYE SAID THE SON I'M IN HOPES IT'LL HOLD UP NOW MIND WHAT THE PARSON SAYS MIND WHAT THE PARSON SAYS MY LADS SAID GRANDFATHER TO THE BLACK-EYED YOUNGSTERS IN KNEE-BREECHES CONSCIOUS OF A MARBLE OR TWO IN THEIR POCKETS WHICH THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO HANDLING A LITTLE SECRETLY DURING THE SERMON
IT SOUNDS VERY GRAND TO SAY THAT SO MANY SHEEP AND OXEN WERE ROASTED WHOLE AND EVERYBODY ATE WHO LIKED TO COME
BUT AT PRESENT ONE MIGHT FANCY THE HOUSE IN THE EARLY STAGE OF A CHANCERY SUIT AND THAT THE FRUIT FROM THAT GRAND DOUBLE ROW OF WALNUT-TREES ON THE RIGHT HAND OF THE ENCLOSURE WOULD FALL AND ROT AMONG THE GRASS IF IT WERE NOT THAT WE HEARD THE BOOMING BARK OF DOGS ECHOING FROM GREAT BUILDINGS AT THE BACK
BUT I DON'T LIKE SITTING UP ABOVE THEE AND MOTHER AS IF I WAS BETTER THAN MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
SETH'S BROAD SHOULDERS HAVE A SLIGHT STOOP
FOR AS FOR THAT BIT O PINK-AND-WHITE THEY'VE TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO PUT IN JAIL I DON'T VALUE HER A ROTTEN NUT--NOT A ROTTEN NUT--ONLY FOR THE HARM OR GOOD THAT MAY COME OUT OF HER TO AN HONEST MAN--A LAD I'VE SET SUCH STORE BY--TRUSTED TO THAT HE'D MAKE MY BIT O KNOWLEDGE GO A GOOD WAY IN THE WORLD....WHY SIR HE'S THE ONLY SCHOLAR I'VE HAD IN THIS STUPID COUNTRY THAT EVER HAD THE WILL OR THE HEAD-PIECE FOR MATHEMATICS
THE TABLE WAS AS CLEAN AS IF VIXEN HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT HOUSEWIFE IN A CHECKERED APRON
THEN THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER NOT QUITE AS THEY HAD LOOKED BEFORE FOR IN THEIR EYES THERE WAS THE MEMORY OF A KISS
HEGH TOTTY SAID ADAM COME AND RIDE ON MY SHOULDER--EVER SO HIGH--YOU'LL TOUCH THE TOPS O THE TREES WHAT LITTLE CHILD EVER REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED BY THAT GLORIOUS SENSE OF BEING SEIZED STRONGLY AND SWUNG UPWARD
THEY RATHER BLENDED WITH ALL THE OTHER DEEP FEELINGS FOR WHICH THE CHURCH SERVICE WAS A CHANNEL TO HIM THIS AFTERNOON AS A CERTAIN CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR ENTIRE PAST AND OUR IMAGINED FUTURE BLENDS ITSELF WITH ALL OUR MOMENTS OF KEEN SENSIBILITY
JUST THE SORT OF PLACE TO BE ORNAMENTED WELL WITH GREEN BOUGHS AND MR CRAIG HAD BEEN PROUD TO SHOW HIS TASTE AND HIS HOTHOUSE PLANTS ON THE OCCASION
PRESENTLY HE DREW HIMSELF UP AND LOOKED FIXEDLY OUT OF THE WINDOW APPARENTLY TURNING OVER SOME NEW IDEA IN HIS MIND
AND MR POYSER AFTER PURSUING HIS WALK FOR A LITTLE WHILE WENT ON I'LL BE BOUND SHE'S GONE AFTER TRYING TO GET A LADY'S MAID'S PLACE FOR SHE'D GOT THAT IN HER HEAD HALF A YEAR AGO AND WANTED ME TO GI MY CONSENT
ANY MAN IN HIS PLACE WOULD HAVE DONE AND FELT THE SAME
AND I SPREAD THE MATTER BEFORE THE LORD
AS SHE THREW DOWN THE LETTER AGAIN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER FACE IN THE GLASS
THEY MEAN WE SHOULDN'T BE OVERANXIOUS AND WORRETING OURSELVES ABOUT WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO-MORROW BUT DO OUR DUTY AND LEAVE THE REST TO GOD'S WILL AYE AYE THAT'S THE WAY WI THEE
AND NOW HER IMAGINATION INSTEAD OF RETRACING THE PAST WAS BUSY FASHIONING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO-MORROW--WHEREABOUT IN THE CHASE SHE SHOULD SEE HIM COMING TOWARDS HER HOW SHE SHOULD PUT HER NEW ROSE-COLOURED RIBBON ON WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN AND WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO HER TO MAKE HER RETURN HIS GLANCE--A GLANCE WHICH SHE WOULD BE LIVING THROUGH IN HER MEMORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL THE REST OF THE DAY
CHAPTER IV HOME AND ITS SORROWS A GREEN VALLEY WITH A BROOK RUNNING THROUGH IT FULL ALMOST TO OVERFLOWING WITH THE LATE RAINS OVERHUNG BY LOW STOOPING WILLOWS
BUT THEE WILT SEE HIM SMILE TO-MORROW SAID ADAM
WHERE DO YOU COOM FROM
AND IF A MAN DOES BITS O JOBS OUT O WORKING HOURS--BUILDS A OVEN FOR S WIFE TO SAVE HER FROM GOING TO THE BAKEHOUSE OR SCRATS AT HIS BIT O GARDEN AND MAKES TWO POTATOES GROW ISTEAD O ONE HE'S DOIN MORE GOOD AND HE'S JUST AS NEAR TO GOD AS IF HE WAS RUNNING AFTER SOME PREACHER AND A-PRAYING AND A-GROANING WELL DONE ADAM SAID SANDY JIM WHO HAD PAUSED FROM HIS PLANING TO SHIFT HIS PLANKS WHILE ADAM WAS SPEAKING
HE WAS TOO WEARY AND WORN-OUT TO ENCOUNTER MORE OF HIS MOTHER'S QUERULOUS GRIEF AND HE WENT TO REST ON HIS BED
THEY'RE ALL I THE MEADOW
THERE'S A SHORT ROAD TO IT A LITTLE FARTHER ON NEAR THE GATE
IT'S WHAT I TOLD YOU UD COME OVER AND OVER AGAIN
DINAH DID NOT THINK ABOUT THINGS AS OTHER PEOPLE DID
A LEATHER CASE WITH A BOTTLE AND GLASS IN ADAM WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING THE CASE
AND OUR LAST DARLING CHILD STARTLES US WITH THE AIR AND GESTURES OF THE SISTER WE PARTED FROM IN BITTERNESS LONG YEARS AGO
A GIRL EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WITH DARK EYES AND DARK CURLY HAIR AND A RED CLOAK ON AND A BASKET ON HER ARM
HE WAS A YOUNG FELLOW ONCE COMING INTO THE ESTATE AND MAKING HIS PLANS
NO IT'LL NOT BE SOON FORGOT AS YOU'VE COME IN BETWEEN HER AND ME WHEN SHE MIGHT HA LOVED ME--IT'LL NOT SOON BE FORGOT AS YOU'VE ROBBED ME O MY HAPPINESS WHILE I THOUGHT YOU WAS MY BEST FRIEND AND A NOBLE-MINDED MAN AS I WAS PROUD TO WORK FOR
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN
AND MR IRWINE'S RECOLLECTIONS OF YOUNG ENTHUSIASM AND AMBITION WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH POETRY AND ETHICS THAT LAY ALOOF FROM THE BIBLE
YOU SEE THEIR WHITE SUNLIT LIMBS GLEAMING ATHWART THE BOUGHS OR PEEPING FROM BEHIND THE SMOOTH-SWEEPING OUTLINE OF A TALL LIME
I'D STAY LONGER ONLY I'M GOING BACK TO SNOWFIELD ON SATURDAY AND I MUST BE WITH MY AUNT TO-MORROW EH I'D NE'ER GO BACK TO THAT COUNTRY
AND THEY SEEMED TO HIM BUT A FEW DAYS FOR THE LOVE HE HAD TO HER I KNOW THOSE WORDS UD COME TRUE WITH ME DINAH IF SO BE YOU'D GIVE ME HOPE AS I MIGHT WIN YOU AFTER SEVEN YEARS WAS OVER
IT SEEMED MORE POSSIBLE TO HER TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND TRY TO BEHAVE AS USUAL
YOU WILL SURELY COME AND LET HER SPEAK THE WORDS THAT ARE IN HER HEART
IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME AND SEE MY MOTHER IN HER TROUBLE HE SAID IN A GENTLE GRATEFUL TONE FOR HIS QUICK MIND TOLD HIM AT ONCE HOW SHE CAME TO BE THERE
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE WHILE MR IRWINE WAS SPEAKING THE SOUND OF A BOOTED STEP AND THE CLINK OF A SPUR WERE HEARD ON THE STONE FLOOR OF THE ENTRANCE-HALL AND JOSHUA RANN MOVED HASTILY ASIDE FROM THE DOORWAY TO MAKE ROOM FOR SOME ONE WHO PAUSED THERE AND SAID IN A RINGING TENOR VOICE GODSON ARTHUR--MAY HE COME IN COME IN COME IN GODSON MRS IRWINE ANSWERED IN THE DEEP HALF-MASCULINE TONE WHICH BELONGS TO THE VIGOROUS OLD WOMAN AND THERE ENTERED A YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN A RIDING-DRESS WITH HIS RIGHT ARM IN A SLING
HE HAD AGREED WITH THE POYSERS THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM TO THEIR NEW NEIGHBOURHOOD WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE FOR HE MEANT TO GIVE UP THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS AND AS SOON AS IT WAS PRACTICABLE HE WOULD WIND UP HIS BUSINESS WITH JONATHAN BURGE AND SETTLE WITH HIS MOTHER AND SETH IN A HOME WITHIN REACH OF THE FRIENDS TO WHOM HE FELT BOUND BY A MUTUAL SORROW
THE RECTOR HE KNOWS BREAKFASTS ALONE AT HALF-PAST NINE THE LADIES OF THE FAMILY HAVING A DIFFERENT BREAKFAST-HOUR
AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES
HE WAS CLEAR-SIGHTED ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT HER UNCLE AND AUNT WOULD HAVE LOOKED KINDLY ON HIS SUIT AND INDEED WITHOUT THIS ENCOURAGEMENT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE PERSEVERED IN GOING TO THE FARM
I'LL SEE YOU EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING CHAPTER XLII THE MORNING OF THE TRIAL AT ONE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY ADAM WAS ALONE IN HIS DULL UPPER ROOM
THEY ARE STINGING YOU--THEY ARE POISONING YOUR SOUL--THEY ARE DRAGGING YOU DOWN INTO A DARK BOTTOMLESS PIT WHERE YOU WILL SINK FOR EVER AND FOR EVER AND FOR EVER FURTHER AWAY FROM LIGHT AND GOD BESSY COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
ANGER ULL MEND NOTHING I KNOW
FOR THE FIRST MOMENT OR TWO HE MADE NO ANSWER BUT LOOKED AT HER WITH THE CONCENTRATED EXAMINING GLANCE WHICH A MAN GIVES TO AN OBJECT IN WHICH HE HAS SUDDENLY BEGUN TO BE INTERESTED
THE LETTER SHOOK AND RUSTLED IN HER HAND
I SHOULDNA HA BEEN FOR MARR'ING THY FEYTHER IF HE'D NE'ER AXED ME
BUT DINAH UD LET NO FONDNESS FOR THE CREATURE DRAW HER OUT O THE PATH AS SHE BELIEVED GOD HAD MARKED OUT FOR HER
YOU ARE A METHODIST--A WESLEYAN I THINK YES MY AUNT AT SNOWFIELD BELONGED TO THE SOCIETY AND I HAVE CAUSE TO BE THANKFUL FOR THE PRIVILEGES I HAVE HAD THEREBY FROM MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD AND HAVE YOU BEEN LONG IN THE HABIT OF PREACHING
IN A MIND WHERE NO STRONG SYMPATHIES ARE AT WORK WHERE THERE IS NO SUPREME SENSE OF RIGHT TO WHICH THE AGITATED NATURE CAN CLING AND STEADY ITSELF TO QUIET ENDURANCE ONE OF THE FIRST RESULTS OF SORROW IS A DESPERATE VAGUE CLUTCHING AFTER ANY DEED THAT WILL CHANGE THE ACTUAL CONDITION
IF THERE IS ANY HERE LIKE THAT POOR WOMAN--IF THEIR MINDS ARE DARK THEIR LIVES UNHOLY--IF THEY HAVE COME OUT NOT SEEKING THEE NOT DESIRING TO BE TAUGHT
ADAM ALONE HAD GONE ON WITH HIS WORK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
THE WOMAN WHO MANAGES A DAIRY HAS A LARGE SHARE IN MAKING THE RENT SO SHE MAY WELL BE ALLOWED TO HAVE HER OPINION ON STOCK AND THEIR KEEP"--AN EXERCISE WHICH STRENGTHENS HER UNDERSTANDING SO MUCH THAT SHE FINDS HERSELF ABLE TO GIVE HER HUSBAND ADVICE ON MOST OTHER SUBJECTS
IT'S AS FOOLISH AS THAT NOTION O YOURS THAT A WIFE IS TO MAKE A WORKING-MAN COMFORTABLE
GREAT WAS THE CLATTER OF KNIVES AND PEWTER PLATES AND TIN CANS WHEN ADAM ENTERED THE HOUSE BUT THERE WAS NO HUM OF VOICES TO THIS ACCOMPANIMENT
AND THAT THE WAY IN WHICH I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HUMAN NATURE IS LOVABLE--THE WAY I HAVE LEARNT SOMETHING OF ITS DEEP PATHOS ITS SUBLIME MYSTERIES--HAS BEEN BY LIVING A GREAT DEAL AMONG PEOPLE MORE OR LESS COMMONPLACE AND VULGAR OF WHOM YOU WOULD PERHAPS HEAR NOTHING VERY SURPRISING IF YOU WERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THEM IN THE NEIGHBOURHOODS WHERE THEY DWELT
AN US AS WAR YOUNG FOLKS ONCE AN THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO RARELY WHEN WE WAR MARRIED
AND IT'S NEWS THAT MAY CONCERN YOU ADAM ELSE I'M A MAN THAT DON'T KNOW A SUPERFICIAL SQUARE FOOT FROM A SOLID HERE BARTLE GAVE A SERIES OF FIERCE AND RAPID PUFFS LOOKING EARNESTLY THE WHILE AT ADAM
YOU MEAN AS ADAM'S FOND O DINAH AYE
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME WI TH COLD POTATOES
AND THEE KNOW'ST HOW HE'S BEHAVED TO ME TO-DAY EH THEE'T DO AS THEE LIK'ST FOR THY OLD MOTHER'S GOT NO RIGHT T HINDER THEE
AND FOR HIS OWN PART HE WAS CURIOUS TO HEAR THE MOST RECENT NEWS ABOUT THE CHASE FARM
IT WAS AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN ADAM REACHED TREDDLESTON
AND AS I TOLD HER SHE WENT CLEAN AGAIN THE SCRIPTUR FOR THAT SAYS LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF
WHEN HETTY HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE VAST CROWD IN THE DISTANCE SHE HAD CLUTCHED DINAH CONVULSIVELY
THE FARMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE MOVING ABOUT THE LAWN AMONG THE FLOWERS AND SHRUBS OR ALONG THE BROAD STRAIGHT ROAD LEADING FROM THE EAST FRONT WHERE A CARPET OF MOSSY GRASS SPREAD ON EACH SIDE STUDDED HERE AND THERE WITH A DARK FLAT-BOUGHED CEDAR OR A GRAND PYRAMIDAL FIR SWEEPING THE GROUND WITH ITS BRANCHES ALL TIPPED WITH A FRINGE OF PALER GREEN
IT ISN'T HURT HE SAID AS HE HELD IT TOWARDS HETTY WHO WAS UNABLE TO TAKE IT BECAUSE BOTH HER HANDS WERE OCCUPIED WITH TOTTY
NEXT TO HIS OWN BROTHER SETH ADAM WOULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE THAN FOR ANY OTHER YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD
LET THE EYES OF THE BLIND BE OPENED
I'M GOING A LONG WAY--TO WINDSOR WHAT
BUT MOST OF THE MEN WERE OF OPINION THAT NOBODY COULD SPEAK MORE STRAIGHTFOR'ARD AND THAT ADAM WAS AS FINE A CHAP AS NEED TO BE
HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL
IN TEN MINUTES FROM THAT TIME MR IRWINE WAS CALLED FOR ON BUSINESS AND ARTHUR BIDDING HIM GOOD-BYE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AGAIN WITH A SENSE OF DISSATISFACTION WHICH HE TRIED TO QUELL BY DETERMINING TO SET OFF FOR EAGLEDALE WITHOUT AN HOUR'S DELAY
I'LL DO BETTER FOR YOU NOR LETTING YOU GO FOR A LADY'S MAID
HE COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE ANY ONE UNCOMFORTABLE
IT WAS MR IRWINE
SCARCENESS O VICTUAL ULL KEEP
HOW IS IT
HOW IS IT
THE LOAD THAT HAD BEEN PRESSING UPON HIM WAS GONE THE HAUNTING FEAR HAD VANISHED
WHY LASSES YE'RE RATHER LATE TO-NIGHT HE SAID WHEN THEY REACHED THE LITTLE GATE LEADING INTO THE CAUSEWAY
SHE TOLD HIM SHE WAS ONLY GOING A LITTLE WAY OUT OF STONITON AND WHEN SHE GOT DOWN AT THE INN WHERE THE COACH STOPPED SHE HASTENED AWAY WITH HER BASKET TO ANOTHER PART OF THE TOWN
AT LAST HE LOOKED UP RIGHT IN ADAM'S FACE SAYING THEN SHE DIDNA DESERVE T HA YE MY LAD
HE'S TOULD ME ON YOU SAID LISBETH FRETFULLY HER OVERPOWERING SENSE OF PAIN RETURNING NOW HER WONDER WAS GONE
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN IT CAME SO NEAR
I MUST NOT KEEP YOU ANY LONGER NOW
THERE WAS MANY A RESPONSIVE SIGH AND GROAN FROM HER FELLOW-METHODISTS BUT THE VILLAGE MIND DOES NOT EASILY TAKE FIRE AND A LITTLE SMOULDERING VAGUE ANXIETY THAT MIGHT EASILY DIE OUT AGAIN WAS THE UTMOST EFFECT DINAH'S PREACHING HAD WROUGHT IN THEM AT PRESENT
THE LAMBS AND CALVES HAVE LOST ALL TRACES OF THEIR INNOCENT FRISKY PRETTINESS AND HAVE BECOME STUPID YOUNG SHEEP AND COWS
WILL YOU PLEASE TO TAKE THIS CHAIR SIR HE SAID LIFTING HIS FATHER'S ARM-CHAIR FORWARD A LITTLE
MY NOTION IS A PRACTICAL BUILDER THAT'S GOT A BIT O TASTE MAKES THE BEST ARCHITECT FOR COMMON THINGS
HIS LIPS ARE MEETING THOSE POUTING CHILD-LIPS AND FOR A LONG MOMENT TIME HAS VANISHED
IT IS NOT THE SPIRIT ONLY THAT TELLS ME THIS--I SEE IT IN THE WHOLE WORK AND WORD OF THE GOSPEL
AND AS FOR YOU MRS BEDE WHY YOU'RE STRAIGHTER I THE BACK NOR HALF THE YOUNG WOMEN NOW EH SAID LISBETH IT'S POOR LUCK FOR THE PLATTER TO WEAR WELL WHEN IT'S BROKE I TWO
HIS THOUGHTS RAN CONSTANTLY ON WHAT THE OLD MAN'S FEELINGS HAD BEEN IN MOMENTS OF HUMILIATION WHEN HE HAD HELD DOWN HIS HEAD BEFORE THE REBUKES OF HIS SON
AND I GAVE HER THE LETTER AND SHE SEEMED TO BEAR IT ALL AFTER A WHILE BETTER THAN I'D EXPECTED...AND SHE BEHAVED KINDER AND KINDER TO ME...I DARESAY SHE DIDN'T KNOW HER OWN FEELINGS THEN POOR THING AND THEY CAME BACK UPON HER WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE...I DON'T WANT TO BLAME HER...I CAN'T THINK AS SHE MEANT TO DECEIVE ME
ALONG WITH ALL HER GRIEF THERE WAS MIXED AN UNUSUAL SENSE OF HER OWN IMPORTANCE IN HAVING A BURIAL AND IN MR IRWINE'S READING A SPECIAL SERVICE FOR HER HUSBAND
BRIGHT SOFT GLANCES HAD PENETRATED HER AND SUFFUSED HER LIFE WITH A STRANGE HAPPY LANGUOR
HE WAS THANKFUL WHEN THE GATES SHUT HIM IN FROM SEEING THOSE EAGER PEOPLE
I SHALL BE THE OLD SQUIRE TO THOSE LITTLE LADS AND LASSES SOME DAY AND THEY'LL TELL THEIR CHILDREN WHAT A MUCH FINER YOUNG FELLOW I WAS THAN MY OWN SON
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FELT ABOUT THE BABY
BUT IN VAIN
IT'LL BE HARD FOR MARTIN POYSER TO GO TO A STRANGE PLACE AMONG STRANGE FACES WHEN HE'S BEEN BRED UP ON THE HALL FARM AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM
EVERY MAN LIKES TO FLIRT WITH A PRETTY GIRL AND EVERY PRETTY GIRL LIKES TO BE FLIRTED WITH
THERE WAS NO LOCK
BEFORE THE FIRST STROKE HAD DIED AWAY SANDY JIM HAD LOOSED HIS PLANE AND WAS REACHING HIS JACKET
IT WAS AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE WE GOT BACK AND WHEN WE WENT IN THE CANDLE WAS STANDING BURNING JUST AS I LEFT IT BUT THE PRISONER AND THE BABY WERE BOTH GONE
MR IRWINE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED
SHE STOOD WITH HER LEFT HAND TOWARDS THE DESCENDING SUN AND LEAFY BOUGHS SCREENED HER FROM ITS RAYS
AND NOW WHILE SHE WALKS WITH HER PIGEON-LIKE STATELINESS ALONG THE ROOM AND LOOKS DOWN ON HER SHOULDERS BORDERED BY THE OLD BLACK LACE THE DARK FRINGE SHOWS TO PERFECTION ON HER PINK CHEEK
AND FOR SOME TIME THE COMPANY APPEARED TO BE MUCH IN EARNEST ABOUT THE DESIRE TO HEAR DAVID'S SONG
SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME
NOBODY SHOULD FIND OUT HOW MISERABLE SHE WAS NOBODY SHOULD KNOW SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT ANYTHING
HE WOULD SHOW THE LOAMSHIRE PEOPLE WHAT A FINE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WAS
HE HAD ALREADY A HIGH REPUTATION IN THE DISTRICT FOR HIS DYES AND HE WAS BENT ON DISCOVERING SOME METHOD BY WHICH HE COULD REDUCE THE EXPENSE OF CRIMSONS AND SCARLETS
THE GROUPS OF COTTAGERS IN THE PARK WERE GRADUALLY DIMINISHING THE YOUNG ONES BEING ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE LIGHTS THAT WERE BEGINNING TO GLEAM FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE GALLERY IN THE ABBEY WHICH WAS TO BE THEIR DANCING-ROOM AND SOME OF THE SOBER ELDER ONES THINKING IT TIME TO GO HOME QUIETLY
THE JUGS ARE BEWITCHED I THINK
SHE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK
IF THEE WAST FOND ENOUGH ON HER THEE WOULDSTNA LET HER GO AWAY BUT I'VE NO RIGHT T HINDER HER IF SHE THINKS WELL SAID ADAM LOOKING AT HIS BOOK AS IF HE WANTED TO GO ON READING
I'LL SEE TO FATHER WHEN HE COMES HOME
I SHOULD BE INCLINED TO CHECK HIM A LITTLE THERE
MOREOVER HE HAD THE WAKEFUL SUSPICIOUS PRIDE OF A POOR MAN IN THE PRESENCE OF A RICH MAN
BUT HE RECOVERED HIMSELF FIRST AND SAID SIT DOWN YOUNG WOMAN SIT DOWN PLACING THE CHAIR FOR HER AND RETIRING TO HIS OLD SEAT ON THE BED
OTHERWISE I DARESAY THURLE WHO IS A MAN OF SOME CAPITAL WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE BOTH THE FARMS AS THEY COULD BE WORKED SO WELL TOGETHER
THERE IS LIGHT AND BLESSEDNESS FOR US AS SOON AS WE CAST IT OFF
NO ONE WANTED TO WORK ON A SUNDAY EVENING
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO GETTIN OUT O THE HIGHROAD HE ADDED WITH A TONE OF GRUFF REPROOF
EVEN IF SHE DID HE HOPED ADAM WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF WHAT SHE SAID
HOWEVER IT MUST COME OUT IN AN UNPREMEDITATED WAY
HE'S NOT ONE OF THOSE THAT THINK THEY CAN COMFORT YOU WITH CHATTERING AS IF FOLKS WHO STAND BY AND LOOK ON KNEW A DEAL BETTER WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE TO BEAR IT
OH DINAH
WHAT COULD SHE DO
IF THERE WAS TROUBLE AT THE HALL FARM--HE ONLY HALF-ADMITTED THE FOREBODING THAT THERE WOULD BE--THE POYSERS MIGHT LIKE TO SEND FOR DINAH
SHE COULDN'T IMAGINE DINAH'S FACE TURNING AWAY FROM HER IN DARK REPROOF OR SCORN DINAH'S VOICE WILLINGLY SPEAKING ILL OF HER OR REJOICING IN HER MISERY AS A PUNISHMENT
AND SHE WAS JUST THE SAME FROM THE FIRST O MY REMEMBERING HER
THEN HE THREW THE BRIDLE ON MEG'S NECK AND PREPARED TO MAKE UP HIS MIND
THE POOR THING HADN'T PERHAPS KNOWN HER OWN MIND FOR A LONG WHILE
BUT ON TOMMY'S ROUND FACE THERE WAS A CLOUD
NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET
SPEAK TO HER OF ME AND TELL HER I OFTEN BEAR HER IN MY THOUGHTS AT EVENING TIME WHEN I AM SITTING IN THE DIM LIGHT AS I DID WITH HER AND WE HELD ONE ANOTHER'S HANDS AND I SPOKE THE WORDS OF COMFORT THAT WERE GIVEN TO ME
HIS HAPPY LOVE--THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HIS STEPS WERE CARRYING HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO HETTY WHO WAS SO SOON TO BE HIS--WAS TO HIS THOUGHTS WHAT THE SWEET MORNING AIR WAS TO HIS SENSATIONS
GIVING UP THIS INQUIRY IN DESPAIR SHE TOOK TO STUDYING DINAH'S NOSE EYES MOUTH AND HAIR AND WONDERING WHETHER IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE SUCH A SORT OF PALE FACE AS THAT OR FAT RED CHEEKS AND ROUND BLACK EYES LIKE HER OWN
I'D NO RIGHT TO SPEAK AS IF YOU'D KNOWN YOU WAS DOING ME AN INJURY
DINAH SAW SHE WAS NOT INCLINED TO TALK BUT THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TIME TO SAY MUCH MORE FOR THEY WERE NOW AT THE YARD-GATE
SETH HAD SAID TO ADAM CAN I HELP THEE WITH ANYTHING IN HERE TO-NIGHT
WHY I SAY AS SOME FOLKS TONGUES ARE LIKE THE CLOCKS AS RUN ON STRIKIN NOT TO TELL YOU THE TIME O THE DAY BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SUMMAT WRONG I THEIR OWN INSIDE MRS POYSER WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BROUGHT HER REJOINDER TO A FURTHER CLIMAX IF EVERY ONE'S ATTENTION HAD NOT AT THIS MOMENT BEEN CALLED TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE WHERE THE LYRICISM WHICH HAD AT FIRST ONLY MANIFESTED ITSELF BY DAVID'S SOTTO VOCE PERFORMANCE OF MY LOVE'S A ROSE WITHOUT A THORN HAD GRADUALLY ASSUMED A RATHER DEAFENING AND COMPLEX CHARACTER
HE COULD NOT DISGUISE MYSTERY IN THIS WAY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF KNOWLEDGE
THE APPLES FELL IN THE ORCHARDS
MR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE COMING TO MEET HER AGAIN ALONG THE FIR-TREE GROVE
SHE SHRANK UP LIKE A FRIGHTENED ANIMAL WHEN SHE SAW ME
MAKE HER COME HERE ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN MANAGE THAT MOTHER
SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END
AND IF ANY TROUBLE SHOULD COME THAT WE DO NOT NOW FORESEE TRUST IN ME TO DO EVERYTHING THAT LIES IN MY POWER
THERE'S MONEY IN YOUR HEAD-PIECE AS THERE'S MONEY I THE SOWN FIELD BUT IT MUST HA TIME
THOSE WHO STAYED AT HOME WERE CHIEFLY MOTHERS LIKE TIMOTHY'S BESS WHO STOOD AT HER OWN DOOR NURSING HER BABY AND FEELING AS WOMEN FEEL IN THAT POSITION--THAT NOTHING ELSE CAN BE EXPECTED OF THEM
AN ISN'T THERE THEM I THIS PARISH AS YOU'VE GOT UNDER HAND AND THEY'RE LIKE ENOUGH TO MAKE FRIENDS WI OLD HARRY AGAIN AS SOON AS YOUR BACK'S TURNED
SHE MUST KEEP IT UNDER HER CLOTHES AND NO ONE WOULD SEE IT
MR IRWINE'S COMING EARLIER ON PURPOSE
DINAH HAD NEVER SAID ANYTHING DISAPPROVING OR REPROACHFUL TO HETTY DURING HER WHOLE VISIT TO THE HALL FARM
FOR IT'S LIKE THE CHILDREN CRYIN WHEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS TAKE THINGS FROM EM
ADAM LONGED TO KNOW THIS FOR HE THOUGHT HE COULD TRUST SETH'S OBSERVATION BETTER THAN HIS MOTHER'S
SCENES OF THE SAD PAST AND PROBABLY SAD FUTURE FLOATING BEFORE HIM AND GIVING PLACE ONE TO THE OTHER IN SWIFT SUCCESSION
DINAH UD BE SURE TO COME AGAIN IF SHE SAW RIGHT TO COME
AND THE NEXT HARD TASK FOR ADAM WAS TO GO HOME AND CARRY THE WRETCHED TIDINGS TO THE HALL FARM
ADAM'S HEART YEARNED OVER HER AS HE LOOKED AT HER
ADAM'S ENTHUSIASM LAY IN THESE THINGS
HE NEED NOT HAVE GONE--HE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE IF HE HAD WANTED TO SEE HER
HE'S GOT A CONSCIENCE AND A WILL TO DO RIGHT AND I'D SOONER WORK FOR HIM NOR FOR ANY MAN LIVING WELL WELL MY BOY IF GOOD LUCK KNOCKS AT YOUR DOOR DON'T YOU PUT YOUR HEAD OUT AT WINDOW AND TELL IT TO BE GONE ABOUT ITS BUSINESS THAT'S ALL
YOU KNOW MRS POYSER--SHE'S MY AUNT AND SHE HAS HEARD OF YOUR GREAT AFFLICTION AND IS VERY SORRY
SETH WAS RIGHT IN BELIEVING THAT LISBETH WOULD BE HELD IN RESTRAINT BY TIMIDITY AND DURING THE NEXT THREE DAYS THE INTERVALS IN WHICH SHE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO ADAM WERE TOO RARE AND SHORT TO CAUSE HER ANY STRONG TEMPTATION
THEN THERE WAS SUPPER TO BE GOT READY AND HETTY MUST BE CONTINUALLY IN THE WAY TO GIVE HELP
BUT BARTLE THOUGHT MR IRWINE WAS REFERRING TO SUICIDE AND HIS FACE WORE A NEW ALARM
EVERY MAN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS CONSCIOUS OF BEING A GREAT PHYSIOGNOMIST
WHEN OUR INDIGNATION IS BORNE IN SUBMISSIVE SILENCE WE ARE APT TO FEEL TWINGES OF DOUBT AFTERWARDS AS TO OUR OWN GENEROSITY IF NOT JUSTICE
HAVE YOU COURAGE TO STAY ALL NIGHT IN THE PRISON
OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING TO HETTY'S SIDE WOULD BE SURE TO TURN UP IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ADAM CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH THAT FOR HE DISLIKED ANY RISK OF BEING JOKED ABOUT HETTY--THE BIG OUTSPOKEN FEARLESS MAN WAS VERY SHY AND DIFFIDENT AS TO HIS LOVE-MAKING
MAYN'T I HAVE THE HALF-CROWN PUT INTO MY MONEY-BOX WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT MY LAD IF YOU WALK ALONG NOW LIKE A GOOD BOY THE FATHER AND MOTHER EXCHANGED A SIGNIFICANT GLANCE OF AMUSEMENT AT THEIR ELDEST-BORN'S ACUTENESS
YOU MUST HELP POOR MARTIN
BUT WHERE IS TOTTY TO-DAY HE SAID
BUT FEELING OVERMUCH ABOUT HER HAS PERHAPS MADE ME UNFAIR TO YOU
GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR PERHAPS IN FLIRTATION BUT ANOTHER MAN IN HIS PLACE WOULD HAVE ACTED MUCH WORSE
THAT'S WHAT COMES O MARR'IN YOUNG WENCHES
BUT STILL ALMOST A HUNDRED MILES FROM WINDSOR THEY TOLD HER
BY SIX O'CLOCK THEY WERE ALL AT BREAKFAST WITH LISBETH IN A KITCHEN AS CLEAN AS SHE COULD HAVE MADE IT HERSELF
WHY TH COCK'S FRANCE AN TH ANCHOR'S NELSON--AN THEY TOLD US THAT BEFOREHAND PEE--EE-EH SAID MR CRAIG
HE HAD BEEN THE SAME ARTHUR EVER SINCE TRYING TO MAKE ALL OFFENCES FORGOTTEN IN BENEFITS
THEY'LL SET THE EMPTY KETTLE O THE FIRE AND THEN COME AN HOUR AFTER TO SEE IF THE WATER BOILS SHE'S DRAWIN FOR THE MEN TOO SAID MR POYSER
NOT ONE
I MUST GO IN MUST I
FOR THERE NOW CAME A LIGHT TAP AND HETTY WITH A LEAPING HEART RUSHED TO BLOW OUT THE CANDLES AND THROW THEM INTO THE DRAWER
I'VE NOT READ THE LETTER BUT HE SAYS HE'S TOLD YOU THE TRUTH IN IT
SHE WAS CLINGING CLOSE TO DINAH
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MR DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY
AND THE HINT HE HAD GIVEN ARTHUR ABOUT HER THE OTHER DAY HAD NO MORE SERIOUS MEANING THAN TO PREVENT HIM FROM NOTICING HER SO AS TO ROUSE THE LITTLE CHIT'S VANITY AND IN THIS WAY PERTURB THE RUSTIC DRAMA OF HER LIFE
YOU BELIEVE IN MY LOVE AND PITY FOR YOU HETTY BUT IF YOU HAD NOT LET ME COME NEAR YOU IF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LOOKED AT ME OR SPOKEN TO ME YOU'D HAVE SHUT ME OUT FROM HELPING YOU
THE TIME MUST BE FILLED UP WITH MOVEMENT UNTIL HE SHOULD SEE HETTY AGAIN
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BECKON TO THE FLYING SWALLOW AS ASK DINAH TO COME AN LIVE HERE COMFORTABLE LIKE OTHER FOLKS
BUT YE MIGHT DO WI A BIT O SHOWIN
THEE'T VERY GOOD SAID SETH GRATEFULLY
AND I BELIEVE SELLING THE MILK IS THE MOST PROFITABLE WAY OF DISPOSING OF DAIRY PRODUCE IS IT NOT AYE THAT'S TRUE SAID MR POYSER UNABLE TO REPRESS AN OPINION ON A QUESTION OF FARMING PROFITS AND FORGETTING THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION
OR WHEN I'M A-COLLECTIN THE DUES
AS FOR OTHER THINGS I DARESAY SHE'S LIKE THE REST O THE WOMEN--THINKS TWO AND TWO LL COME TO MAKE FIVE IF SHE CRIES AND BOTHERS ENOUGH ABOUT IT AYE AYE SAID MRS POYSER
IT WAS SO SWEET TO LOOK AT HER EYES WHICH HAD NOW A SELF-FORGETFUL QUESTIONING IN THEM--FOR A MOMENT HE FORGOT THAT HE WANTED TO SAY ANYTHING OR THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO TELL HER WHAT HE MEANT
IT'S ALL WI GOING SO AMONG THEM SERVANTS AT THE CHASE AS WE WAR FOOLS FOR LETTING HER
Y ARE GOIN TO TH PREACHIN TO-NIGHT I SHOULD THINK
BUT THERE WAS A PAUSE BEFORE THE THREE MOURNERS CAME ON
AND TAKES CARE THAT SOME NARROW-BROWED FELLOW TROLLING A BALLAD IN THE CORNER OF A POT-HOUSE SHALL BE AS TRUE TO HIS INTERVALS AS A BIRD
RUN BACK AND TELL EM TO COME ON MR AND MRS POYSER WERE NOW AT THE END OF THE SECOND FIELD SO THEY SET TOTTY ON THE TOP OF ONE OF THE LARGE STONES FORMING THE TRUE LOAMSHIRE STILE AND AWAITED THE LOITERERS TOTTY OBSERVING WITH COMPLACENCY DEY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY BOYS--ME DOOD THE FACT WAS THAT THIS SUNDAY WALK THROUGH THE FIELDS WAS FRAUGHT WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT TO MARTY AND TOMMY WHO SAW A PERPETUAL DRAMA GOING ON IN THE HEDGEROWS AND COULD NO MORE REFRAIN FROM STOPPING AND PEEPING THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN A COUPLE OF SPANIELS OR TERRIERS
ADAM LOOKED ROUND AS HE HEARD THE QUICKENING CLATTER OF THE HORSE'S HEELS AND WAITED FOR THE HORSEMAN LIFTING HIS PAPER CAP FROM HIS HEAD WITH A BRIGHT SMILE OF RECOGNITION
AND WHAT ELSE DID Y EXPECT TO FIND HIM BUT PLEASANT SAID MRS POYSER IMPATIENTLY RESUMING HER KNITTING
HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT TO GET HOME WITH YOUNG WOMAN SAID THE WELL-WISHER AT LENGTH
BELIKE SIR YOU HAVENA HEARED AS THIAS BEDE'S DEAD--DROWNDED THIS MORNING OR MORE LIKE OVERNIGHT I THE WILLOW BROOK AGAIN THE BRIDGE RIGHT I FRONT O THE HOUSE AH EXCLAIMED BOTH THE GENTLEMEN AT ONCE AS IF THEY WERE A GOOD DEAL INTERESTED IN THE INFORMATION
IT WAS THE BAND OF THE BENEFIT CLUB WHICH HAD MUSTERED IN ALL ITS GLORY--THAT IS TO SAY IN BRIGHT-BLUE SCARFS AND BLUE FAVOURS AND CARRYING ITS BANNER WITH THE MOTTO LET BROTHERLY LOVE CONTINUE ENCIRCLING A PICTURE OF A STONE-PIT
I'D HAVE THEE GO AND SEE HER BY AND BY
CHAPTER XIII EVENING IN THE WOOD IT HAPPENED THAT MRS POMFRET HAD HAD A SLIGHT QUARREL WITH MRS BEST THE HOUSEKEEPER ON THIS THURSDAY MORNING--A FACT WHICH HAD TWO CONSEQUENCES HIGHLY CONVENIENT TO HETTY
COME MIGHTY SAVIOUR
HE MUST HAVE HAD EYES OF EGYPTIAN GRANITE NOT TO LOOK TOO LOVINGLY IN RETURN
I SHALL TURN METHODIST SOME DAY HE SAID WHEN SHE PREACHES OUT OF DOORS AND GO TO HEAR HER AND I SAID NAY SIR YOU CAN'T DO THAT FOR CONFERENCE HAS FORBID THE WOMEN PREACHING AND SHE'S GIVEN IT UP ALL BUT TALKING TO THE PEOPLE A BIT IN THEIR HOUSES AH SAID SETH WHO COULD NOT REPRESS A COMMENT ON THIS POINT AND A SORE PITY IT WAS O CONFERENCE
POOR THINGS
HOW PLEASANT IT MUST BE TO BE TAUGHT BY HIM
OR WASN'T HE THERE O SATURDAY OH HE WENT AWAY BEFORE CARROLL CAME
THESE POOR SILLY WOMEN-THINGS--THEY'VE NOT THE SENSE TO KNOW IT'S NO USE DENYING WHAT'S PROVED
ADAM WAS BY NATURE RESERVED IN ALL MATTERS OF FEELING AND SETH FELT A CERTAIN TIMIDITY TOWARDS HIS MORE PRACTICAL BROTHER
IT HAD BEEN SETTLED VERY DEFINITELY WHAT MR POYSER WAS TO DO WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE SHOULD APPEAR AND FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF ABSTRACTION WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DARK PICTURE OPPOSITE AND HIS HANDS BUSY WITH THE LOOSE CASH AND OTHER ARTICLES IN HIS BREECHES POCKETS
HE ALWAYS WENT TO CHURCH ON SACRAMENT SUNDAYS BUT NOT VERY REGULARLY AT OTHER TIMES
I CAN'T FIND OUT WHERE SHE WENT AFTER SHE GOT TO STONITON SETH WAS SILENT FROM UTTER ASTONISHMENT
ARTHUR'S AS YOU KNOW WAS A LOVING NATURE
OH NO SIR
HERE SHE IS SAID THE CAPTAIN LIFTING HER UP AND SETTING HER ON THE LOW STONE SHELF
IT CAN'T BE AS SHE'LL DIE THAT SHAMEFUL DEATH--I CAN'T BRING MY MIND TO IT HE GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AGAIN AND LOOKED AWAY OUT OF THE WINDOW WHILE DINAH STOOD WITH COMPASSIONATE PATIENCE
HE HAD NO THEORIES ABOUT SETTING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS BUT HE SAW THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE DONE BY BUILDING WITH ILL-SEASONED TIMBER--BY IGNORANT MEN IN FINE CLOTHES MAKING PLANS FOR OUTHOUSES AND WORKSHOPS AND THE LIKE WITHOUT KNOWING THE BEARINGS OF THINGS--BY SLOVENLY JOINERS WORK AND BY HASTY CONTRACTS THAT COULD NEVER BE FULFILLED WITHOUT RUINING SOMEBODY
I'VE GOT MY HAT AND THINGS AT WILL MASKERY'S
SUCH A VOICE COULD ONLY COME FROM A BROAD CHEST AND THE BROAD CHEST BELONGED TO A LARGE-BONED MUSCULAR MAN NEARLY SIX FEET HIGH WITH A BACK SO FLAT AND A HEAD SO WELL POISED THAT WHEN HE DREW HIMSELF UP TO TAKE A MORE DISTANT SURVEY OF HIS WORK HE HAD THE AIR OF A SOLDIER STANDING AT EASE
HE WONDERED WHETHER SHE HAD FELT ANYTHING ABOUT IT
IT'S A SORROWFUL LETTER
NO LAD
LET US GO TO THE PRISON NOW MR MASSEY SAID ADAM WHEN HE SAW THE HAND OF HIS WATCH AT SIX
SPEAK TO HIM HETTY DINAH SAID
ADAM'S FATHER THE OLD MAN IS DROWNED
AND EXCELLENT GREY RIBBED STOCKINGS KNITTED BY MRS POYSER'S OWN HAND SETTING OFF THE PROPORTIONS OF HIS LEG
HE GIVES THE RIGHT RING WHEN YOU TRY HIM OUR PARSON DOES
WHICH WAS ALL THE PLEASANTER BECAUSE IF A REMARK ABOUT TO-MORROW MORNING'S WORK OCCURRED TO MR POYSER ALICK WAS AT HAND TO HEAR IT
IF SHE HAD EVER SEEN ONE I THINK THE WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HARD FOR HER
IT'S ONLY THE FEVER SHATTERED HIM SO
SO THEE WUTNA MIND EH AN WHAT'S THEE GOT THY BEST CLOOSE ON FOR TO GO TO TH HALL FARM
HE MIGHT TAKE ON BILLY PITT AGAIN IF HE LIKED
WHOSE THOUGHTS HAD ALWAYS BEEN TAKING HOLIDAY IN DREAMS OF PLEASURE BECAUSE ALL THE BUSINESS OF HER LIFE WAS MANAGED FOR HER--THIS KITTENLIKE HETTY WHO TILL A FEW MONTHS AGO HAD NEVER FELT ANY OTHER GRIEF THAN THAT OF ENVYING MARY BURGE A NEW RIBBON OR BEING GIRDED AT BY HER AUNT FOR NEGLECTING TOTTY MUST NOW MAKE HER TOILSOME WAY IN LONELINESS HER PEACEFUL HOME LEFT BEHIND FOR EVER AND NOTHING BUT A TREMULOUS HOPE OF DISTANT REFUGE BEFORE HER
HAD THE BLOW BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIM
HE FINGERED THE GUINEAS IN HIS POCKET AND ATE HIS DINNERS AND SLEPT THE SLEEP OF THE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR HAD HE NOT KEPT UP HIS CHARACTER BY GOING TO CHURCH ON THE SUNDAY AFTERNOONS
THE WOMEN MOSTLY BRING THEIR CHILDREN WITH EM BUT TO-DAY THERE WAS ONE STOUT CURLY HEADED FELLOW ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEAR OLD THAT I NEVER SAW THERE BEFORE
HE'S LIKE ENOUGH TO KNOW FOR SHE'S A PREACHING WOMAN AS THE METHODISTS THINK A DEAL ON I'LL SEND TO SETH SAID MR POYSER
CAN I BRING HIM BACK AGAIN
HAPPEN IT'LL BE EVER SO LONG ON THE ROAD AN NEVER REACH HER AT LAST BEFORE ALICK ARRIVED WITH THE MESSAGE LISBETH'S THOUGHTS TOO HAD ALREADY FLOWN TO DINAH AND SHE HAD SAID TO SETH EH THERE'S NO COMFORT FOR US I THIS WORLD ANY MORE WI'OUT THEE COULDST GET DINAH MORRIS TO COME TO US AS SHE DID WHEN MY OLD MAN DIED
WELL ADAM HE SAID IN A TONE OF FRIENDLY CONCESSION YOU'RE PERHAPS RIGHT
TELL ME HOW SHE LOOKED HE SAID PRESENTLY
AS QUICK!--HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU MEANT IN A MINUTE AND HE KNEW ALL ABOUT BUILDING AND COULD SEE WHEN YOU'D MADE A GOOD JOB
ADAM...I'M VERY SORRY...I BEHAVED VERY WRONG TO YOU...WILL YOU FORGIVE ME...BEFORE I DIE ADAM ANSWERED WITH A HALF-SOB YES I FORGIVE THEE HETTY
AND AS FOR SPINNING WHY YOU'VE WASTED AS MUCH AS YOUR WAGE I THE FLAX YOU'VE SPOILED LEARNING TO SPIN
LONG WHILE
AS SHE WAS LOOKING IN THIS WAY SHE HEARD SETH'S STEP JUST OUTSIDE THE OPEN DOOR TOWARDS WHICH HER BACK WAS TURNED AND SAID RAISING HER CLEAR TREBLE SETH IS YOUR BROTHER WRATHFUL WHEN HIS PAPERS ARE STIRRED YES VERY WHEN THEY ARE NOT PUT BACK IN THE RIGHT PLACES SAID A DEEP STRONG VOICE NOT SETH'S
SELF-ACCUSATION WAS TOO PAINFUL TO HIM--HE COULD NOT FACE IT
THEY ALLAYS PUT ME I MIND O THE PAINTED WOMEN OUTSIDE THE SHOWS AT TREDDLES'ON FAIR
WIRY BEN NEVER SMILED
WHAT HAVE I DONE
IT'S A VOLUME OF POEMS LYRICAL BALLADS MOST OF THEM SEEM TO BE TWADDLING STUFF BUT THE FIRST IS IN A DIFFERENT STYLE--'THE ANCIENT MARINER IS THE TITLE
YES THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO DO AFTER ALL
I POSITIVELY FELT QUITE BASHFUL THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER--SHE WAS SITTING STOOPING OVER HER SEWING IN THE SUNSHINE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE WHEN I RODE UP AND CALLED OUT WITHOUT NOTICING THAT SHE WAS A STRANGER IS MARTIN POYSER AT HOME I DECLARE WHEN SHE GOT UP AND LOOKED AT ME AND JUST SAID HE'S IN THE HOUSE I BELIEVE
MY NAME IS COLONEL TOWNLEY
OR ARE YOU THINKING OF THE DANGER FOR ARTHUR IN CROSSING THAT FRIGHTFUL IRISH CHANNEL AT THIS TIME OF YEAR NO MOTHER I'M NOT THINKING OF THAT
AND I HAVE HEARD OF A LEARNED MAN MEEKLY ROCKING THE TWINS IN THE CRADLE WITH HIS LEFT HAND WHILE WITH HIS RIGHT HE INFLICTED THE MOST LACERATING SARCASMS ON AN OPPONENT WHO HAD BETRAYED A BRUTAL IGNORANCE OF HEBREW
BUT SETH
HIS HEARTY AFFECTION FOR THE RECTOR DATED FROM THE AGE OF FROCKS AND TROUSERS
THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT SCENE HAD OFTEN BEEN WITH HIM SINCE THURSDAY EVENING
AND MERE PEN-STROKES HOWEVER PERVERSE WERE LESS EXASPERATING TO BARTLE THAN FALSE ARITHMETIC
HE SAYS FOLKS LOOKS BETTER IN UGLY CLOTHES NAY NAY SAID ADAM LOOKING AT HER ADMIRINGLY
SAY NO MORE ABOUT OUR ANGER ADAM HE SAID AT LAST VERY LANGUIDLY FOR THE LABOUR OF SPEECH WAS UNWELCOME TO HIM
IT WAR GOOD ON YOU TO COME
IT HAD NEVER ENTERED HER MIND THAT HE HAD BEEN YOUNG LIKE OTHER MEN
HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART
WHEN ADAM CAME BACK WITH HIS SUPPLIES HIS ENTRANCE AWOKE ARTHUR FROM A DOZE
EPICUREAN IF YOU WILL WITH NO ENTHUSIASM NO SELF-SCOURGING SENSE OF DUTY
AND THAT HOLDS GOOD WITH MARRIAGE AS WELL AS WITH OTHER THINGS
I'M NOT FORGETTIN MYSELF SO FAR AS TO BE WISE ABOVE MY BETTERS
NO ARTHUR HAD NOT AN EVIL FEELING IN HIS MIND TOWARDS ANY HUMAN BEING
YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WOMEN'S NATURES IF YOU ARE SO EXCESSIVELY RATIONAL
AND SO POOR HETTY HAD GOT A FACE AND A PRESENCE HAUNTING HER WAKING AND SLEEPING DREAMS
NOT AT ALL ONE I SHOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE ARTHUR SILENTLY RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD MAKE BESSY A PRESENT OF MONEY BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER THAT SHE MIGHT BUY SOMETHING MORE TO HER MIND
BUT I THOUGHT THEE WOULDSTNA LIKE TO HEAR THE WORK GOING ON AN WHY SHOULDNA I LIKE T
WELL I CAN'T RIGHTLY SAY
SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN
THERE'S CHOWNE'S WIFE WANTS HIM TO BUY NO OTHER SORT WHAT'S IT SINNIFY WHAT CHOWNE'S WIFE LIKES
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW HETTY
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT
AND OG THE KING OF BASAN
THERE WERE SOME BUNS IN HER BASKET--THREE WHICH SHE HAD SUPPLIED HERSELF WITH AT THE PLACE WHERE SHE ATE HER DINNER
MR IRWINE HAS JUST TOLD ME ABOUT IT OH HOW DREADFUL SAID HETTY LOOKING SERIOUS BUT NOT DEEPLY AFFECTED
OH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK HOW IT WOULD BE
BUT THEN CAME THE DAYS OF SADNESS WHEN ADAM WAS SOMEWAY ON IN HIS TEENS AND THIAS BEGAN TO LOITER AT THE PUBLIC-HOUSES AND LISBETH BEGAN TO CRY AT HOME AND TO POUR FORTH HER PLAINTS IN THE HEARING OF HER SONS
THERE'S NO FEAR BUT HE'LL YIELD WELL I THE THRESHING
THAT WAS THEIR COMMON PRACTICE
FOR THE MASTER AND SERVANTS ATE THEIR SUPPER NOT FAR OFF EACH OTHER
THE CHAPLAIN WALKED AWAY BUT THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN STOOD STILL LOOKING DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT AND STROKING HIS CHIN WITH A RUMINATING AIR WHEN HE WAS ROUSED BY A SWEET CLEAR WOMAN'S VOICE SAYING CAN I GET INTO THE PRISON IF YOU PLEASE HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED FIXEDLY AT THE SPEAKER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WITHOUT ANSWERING
IN MY OUTWARD LOT WHICH YOU ASK ABOUT I HAVE ALL THINGS AND ABOUND
HE'S SAID IN PLENTY OF PEOPLE'S HEARING THAT HE'D MAKE YOU MANAGER OF THE WOODS TO-MORROW IF HE'D THE POWER
YOU MUST LEARN TO DEAL WITH ODD AND EVEN IN LIFE AS WELL AS IN FIGURES
AT THE NEXT STILE THE PATHWAY BRANCHES OFF
THEY'RE SATISFIED WI LOOKING NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT
WILL YOU PLEASE TO COME IN SHE ADDED RETIRING FROM THE DOOR AS IF RECOLLECTING HERSELF
ADAM AT THIS MOMENT COULD ONLY FEEL THAT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HETTY--ROBBED TREACHEROUSLY BY THE MAN IN WHOM HE HAD TRUSTED--AND HE STOOD CLOSE IN FRONT OF ARTHUR WITH FIERCE EYES GLARING AT HIM WITH PALE LIPS AND CLENCHED HANDS THE HARD TONES IN WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONSTRAINING HIMSELF TO EXPRESS NO MORE THAN A JUST INDIGNATION GIVING WAY TO A DEEP AGITATED VOICE THAT SEEMED TO SHAKE HIM AS HE SPOKE
YOU SHANNA HAVE A MORSEL O CAKE IF YOU BEHAVE SO TOMMY WITH TRUE BROTHERLY SYMPATHY WAS AMUSING HIMSELF BY TURNING DOLLY'S SKIRT OVER HER BALD HEAD AND EXHIBITING HER TRUNCATED BODY TO THE GENERAL SCORN--AN INDIGNITY WHICH CUT TOTTY TO THE HEART
JOSHUA HIMSELF WAS LESS PROUD OF HIS READING THAN OF HIS SINGING AND IT WAS ALWAYS WITH A SENSE OF HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE THAT HE PASSED FROM THE DESK TO THE CHOIR
THE MISS IRWINES ALLAYS SAY OH MRS POYSER I ENVY YOU YOUR DAIRY
AND THE NEXT MORNING ANOTHER CONSTABLE CAME TO ME TO GO WITH HIM TO THE SPOT WHERE I FOUND THE CHILD
SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE
BY THE TIME THE RED SUNLIGHT SHONE ON THE BRASS NAILS THAT FORMED THE INITIALS ON THE LID OF THE COFFIN ANY LINGERING FOREBODING FROM THE SOUND OF THE WILLOW WAND WAS MERGED IN SATISFACTION THAT THE WORK WAS DONE AND THE PROMISE REDEEMED
I KNOW WE SHALL STICK TOGETHER TO THE LAST I TAKE NOUGHT ILL O THEE ADAM
HE'D BEEN BUT A POOR BARGAIN TO HER THIS FIVE YEAR SHE'S BEEN GREATLY DISTRESSED FOR THE LOSS OF HIM SAID DINAH BUT SHE'S SEEMED MORE COMFORTED TO-DAY
THE EXCITEMENT OF SUSPENSE HEIGHTENING WITH EVERY HOUR THAT BROUGHT HIM NEARER THE FATAL MOMENT WAS TOO GREAT AND IN SPITE OF HIS ENTREATIES IN SPITE OF HIS PROMISES THAT HE WOULD BE PERFECTLY QUIET THE SCHOOLMASTER WATCHED TOO
BUT THE FARMERS HAD FOUND OUT AFTER LONG PUZZLING THAT THIS POLISH WAS ONE OF THE SIGNS OF HARDNESS
WHY IT'S PRETTY NEAR A THREE-WEEK SINCE Y HAD YOUR SUPPER WITH US
IT'S THE DILECK SAYS HE AYE AYE SAID THE STRANGER SMILING
HE HAD FELT SURE THAT HER FACE WOULD BE MANTLED WITH THE SMILE OF CONSCIOUS SAINTSHIP OR ELSE CHARGED WITH DENUNCIATORY BITTERNESS
I SHOULD HA BEEN THANKFUL FOR HER TO STAY AMONG US BUT IF SHE THINKS WELL TO GO I WOULDN'T CROSS HER OR MAKE IT HARD TO HER BY OBJECTING
THE SIGHT OF MR DONNITHORNE'S CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WINDING SLOWLY UP THE HILL PERHAPS HELPING TO MAKE THEM FEEL THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HASTE
LITTLE LITTLE EARS ARTHUR HAD SAID PRETENDING TO PINCH THEM ONE EVENING AS HETTY SAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GRASS WITHOUT HER HAT
AND OH IT CRIED SO DINAH--I COULDN'T COVER IT QUITE UP--I THOUGHT PERHAPS SOMEBODY UD COME AND TAKE CARE OF IT AND THEN IT WOULDN'T DIE
AND SOON THEY BECAME SUDDENLY SILENT
BUT WE GET ACCUSTOMED TO MENTAL AS WELL AS BODILY PAIN WITHOUT FOR ALL THAT LOSING OUR SENSIBILITY TO IT
HETTY SANK DOWN ON THE STRAW WITH A SENSE OF ESCAPE
THAT WHATEVER HE UNDERTAKES TO DO HE DOES WELL AND IS AS CAREFUL FOR THE INTERESTS OF THOSE WHO EMPLOY HIM AS FOR HIS OWN
AND AS TO THAT BETTY AS WAS DAIRYMAID AT TRENT'S BEFORE SHE COME TO ME SHE'D HA LEFT THE CHEESES WITHOUT TURNING FROM WEEK'S END TO WEEK'S END AND THE DAIRY THRALLS I MIGHT HA WROTE MY NAME ON EM WHEN I COME DOWNSTAIRS AFTER MY ILLNESS AS THE DOCTOR SAID IT WAS INFLAMMATION--IT WAS A MERCY I GOT WELL OF IT
MEN'S LIVES ARE AS THOROUGHLY BLENDED WITH EACH OTHER AS THE AIR THEY BREATHE
AND NOW HE'S GONE I'D BE GLAD FOR THE WORST O'ER AGAIN YES SAID DINAH CAREFUL NOT TO OPPOSE ANY FEELING OF LISBETH'S FOR HER RELIANCE IN HER SMALLEST WORDS AND DEEDS ON A DIVINE GUIDANCE ALWAYS ISSUED IN THAT FINEST WOMAN'S TACT WHICH PROCEEDS FROM ACUTE AND READY SYMPATHY
AND AFTER A MOMENTARY START BEGAN TO PACE WITH A PIGEON-LIKE STATELINESS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ALONG HER ROOM IN HER COLOURED STAYS AND COLOURED SKIRT AND THE OLD BLACK LACE SCARF ROUND HER SHOULDERS AND THE GREAT GLASS EAR-RINGS IN HER EARS
SO HE SAT DOWN IN A CORNER AND LOOKED ON WITH AN ABSENT MIND
EUROPE ADJUSTS ITSELF TO A FAIT ACCOMPLI AND SO DOES AN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER--UNTIL THE PLACID ADJUSTMENT IS DISTURBED BY A CONVULSIVE RETRIBUTION
YOU SEE SIR THIS ISN'T A TRIFLE TO ME WHATEVER IT MAY BE TO YOU
I ALWAYS SET OUT BY EIGHT O'CLOCK AND IT'S SO LIGHT NOW IN THE EVENING
ADAM THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED IN THEM THAT NOTION OF COMPENSATION FOR IRRETRIEVABLE WRONG THAT SELF-SOOTHING ATTEMPT TO MAKE EVIL BEAR THE SAME FRUITS AS GOOD WHICH MOST OF ALL ROUSED HIS INDIGNATION
FOR MY PART I THINK IT'S BETTER TO SEE WHEN YOUR PERPENDICULAR'S TRUE THAN TO SEE A GHOST SUCH THOUGHTS AS THESE ARE APT TO GROW STRONGER AND STRONGER AS DAYLIGHT QUENCHES THE CANDLES AND THE BIRDS BEGIN TO SING
IT SPOILS THE FLAVOUR O THE CHINE TO MY THINKING
AND AS TO THIS NEW EMPLOYMENT I'VE TAKEN IN HAND I'LL ONLY SAY THAT I TOOK IT AT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S DESIRE AND THAT I'LL TRY TO FULFIL HIS EXPECTATIONS
EVERY MORNING TO COME AS FAR AS HER IMAGINATION COULD STRETCH SHE WOULD HAVE TO GET UP AND FEEL THAT THE DAY WOULD HAVE NO JOY FOR HER
AND SO WHEN HE WENT TO BED
SOBER WELL-TO-DO MEN DON'T LIKE SUCH PRETTY WIVES
ALICK INDEED WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS A HONEYED MAN
NOT DISTANT ENOUGH TO BE CLOTHED IN PURPLE MYSTERY BUT WITH SOMBRE GREENISH SIDES VISIBLY SPECKED WITH SHEEP WHOSE MOTION WAS ONLY REVEALED BY MEMORY NOT DETECTED BY SIGHT
ADAM MY DEAR FRIEND YOU HAVE HAD SOME HARD TRIALS IN YOUR LIFE
HOWIVER WHETHER I'M WISE OR NO THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE BUT WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY I SAY--AS THE YOUNG METHODIS WOMAN AS IS AT MESTER POYSER'S WAS A-PREACHIN AN A-PRAYIN ON THE GREEN LAST NIGHT AS SURE AS I'M A-STANNIN AFORE YOUR REVERENCE NOW PREACHING ON THE GREEN SAID MR IRWINE LOOKING SURPRISED BUT QUITE SERENE
BUT HE FOUND A READING LESSON IN WORDS OF ONE SYLLABLE A HARDER MATTER TO DEAL WITH THAN THE HARDEST STONE HE HAD EVER HAD TO SAW
VISIT THEN THIS SOUL OF MINE PIERCE THE GLOOM OF SIN AND GRIEF FILL ME RADIANCY DIVINE SCATTER ALL MY UNBELIEF
AND TO BE DISGUSTED AT EVERY TURN WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF THE HOUSE AND THE ESTATE
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A CHAP FOR WOOL-GATHERING
THAT WAS A REFLECTION THAT MARRED THE CONSOLING PROSPECT
PERHAPS JUG-BREAKING LIKE OTHER CRIMES HAS A CONTAGIOUS INFLUENCE
THEY'VE DRESSED THEMSELVES OUT IN THAT WAY ONE UD THINK TO BE SCARECROWS AND WARNINGS AGAINST ANY MAN EVER MEDDLING WITH A WOMAN AGAIN
SHE MUST SURELY HAVE FOUND IT PLEASANTER TO BE WITH DINAH THAN ANY ONE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED
HER TEARS WERE ALL WEPT AWAY IN THE WEARY NIGHT BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP
I BELIEVE THAT GELL MOLLY--AS IS AGGRAVATIN ENOUGH FOR THE MATTER O THAT--BUT I BELIEVE SHE'D CARE MORE ABOUT LEAVING US AND THE CHILDREN FOR ALL SHE'S BEEN HERE BUT A YEAR COME MICHAELMAS NOR HETTY WOULD
IF DINAH HAD GOT A BIT O COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS AN DIDN'T STICK THAT METHODIST CAP ON HER HEAD ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN THE COWS FOLKS UD THINK HER AS PRETTY AS HETTY NAY NAY SAID MR POYSER WITH RATHER A CONTEMPTUOUS EMPHASIS THEE DOSTNA KNOW THE PINTS OF A WOMAN
BUT PERHAPS DOUBTS COME INTO YOUR MIND LIKE THIS
MOTHER HE SAID HALF-CRYING MARTY'S GOT EVER SO MUCH MORE MONEY IN HIS BOX NOR I'VE GOT IN MINE MUNNY ME WANT HALF-A-TOUN IN MY BOTS SAID TOTTY
SHE FELT NOTHING BUT THAT ARTHUR WAS CRUEL--CRUEL TO WRITE SO CRUEL NOT TO MARRY HER
I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT
IT WAS A STRANGELY MINGLED PICTURE--THE FRESH YOUTH OF THE SUMMER MORNING WITH ITS EDENLIKE PEACE AND LOVELINESS THE STALWART STRENGTH OF THE TWO BROTHERS IN THEIR RUSTY WORKING CLOTHES AND THE LONG COFFIN ON THEIR SHOULDERS
SHE FELT HERSELF TURNING PALE HER LIPS TREMBLING
SHE GOT INTO THE HAMPER AND GOT OUT AGAIN THE NEXT MOMENT AND BEHAVED WITH TRUE FEMININE FOLLY THOUGH LOOKING ALL THE WHILE AS WISE AS A DWARF WITH A LARGE OLD-FASHIONED HEAD AND BODY ON THE MOST ABBREVIATED LEGS
MR RANN'S LEATHERN APRON AND SUBDUED GRIMINESS CAN LEAVE NO ONE IN ANY DOUBT THAT HE IS THE VILLAGE SHOEMAKER
THY POOR FEYTHER ULL NE'ER ANGER THEE NO MORE
HE FELL ON SETH'S NECK AND SOBBED
HETTY DID NOT SEE THE FACE--SHE SAW NOTHING--SHE ONLY FELT THAT SHE WAS COLD AND SICK AND TREMBLING
IN THE ENCLOSED LETTER I HAVE WRITTEN EVERYTHING YOU WISH
AND WHEN ADAM WAS MARCHING ALONG THE LANES WITH HIS BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF JOCOSE TALK AND RINGING LAUGHTER FROM BEHIND THE HEDGES
SHE HAS THE SPIRIT OF THREE MEN WITH THAT PALE FACE OF HERS
THEY MADE NO FUSS ABOUT MR CASSON ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT BUTLER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS
AN ME A-SLEEPIN AS IF I NE'ER BELONGED TO HIM NO MORE NOR IF HE'D BEEN A JOURNEYMAN TRAMP FROM NOBODY KNOWS WHERE HERE LISBETH BEGAN TO CRY AND ROCK HERSELF AGAIN
THEY MIGHT ALMOST AS WELL GO AND PREACH ON THE BINTON HILLS
BUT I'VE GOT A LETTER I MY POCKET AS HE WROTE HIMSELF FOR ME TO GIVE YOU
OTHERS CHOSE TO CONTINUE STANDING AND HAD TURNED THEIR FACES TOWARDS THE VILLAGERS WITH A LOOK OF MELANCHOLY COMPASSION WHICH WAS HIGHLY AMUSING TO BESSY CRANAGE THE BLACKSMITH'S BUXOM DAUGHTER KNOWN TO HER NEIGHBOURS AS CHAD'S BESS WHO WONDERED WHY THE FOLKS WAR AMAKIN FACES A THAT'NS CHAD'S BESS WAS THE OBJECT OF PECULIAR COMPASSION BECAUSE HER HAIR BEING TURNED BACK UNDER A CAP WHICH WAS SET AT THE TOP OF HER HEAD EXPOSED TO VIEW AN ORNAMENT OF WHICH SHE WAS MUCH PROUDER THAN OF HER RED CHEEKS--NAMELY A PAIR OF LARGE ROUND EAR-RINGS WITH FALSE GARNETS IN THEM ORNAMENTS CONDEMNED NOT ONLY BY THE METHODISTS BUT BY HER OWN COUSIN AND NAMESAKE TIMOTHY'S BESS WHO WITH MUCH COUSINLY FEELING OFTEN WISHED THEM EAR-RINGS MIGHT COME TO GOOD
I'LL GO WITH YOU BEFORE MY EARS ARE SPLIT I'LL GO ROUND BY THE COMMON AND SEE YOU HOME IF YOU LIKE MR MASSEY SAID ADAM
IT ISN'T SPINNING AS YOU'D BE AT I'LL BE BOUND AND LET YOU HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
BUT I FANCY I HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF YOU WHEN WE COME TO LOOK CLOSE
BUT SANDY JIM AND SEVERAL OF THE FARM-LABOURERS MADE A GROUP ROUND IT AND STOOD WITH THEIR HATS OFF AS FELLOW-MOURNERS WITH THE MOTHER AND SONS
WHY ADAM SHE'LL BREAK YOUR ARM SUCH A BIG GELL AS THAT
THERE'S CHOWNE'S WIFE UGLY ENOUGH TO TURN THE MILK AN SAVE THE RENNET BUT SHE'LL NIVER SAVE NOTHING ANY OTHER WAY
HE HURRIED ON ACROSS THE CHASE STALKING ALONG THE NARROW PATHS BETWEEN THE FERN WITH GYP AT HIS HEELS NOT LINGERING TO WATCH THE MAGNIFICENT CHANGES OF THE LIGHT--HARDLY ONCE THINKING OF IT--YET FEELING ITS PRESENCE IN A CERTAIN CALM HAPPY AWE WHICH MINGLED ITSELF WITH HIS BUSY WORKING-DAY THOUGHTS
MRS POYSER WAS PROVOKED AT HERSELF FOR SHE COULD HARDLY KEEP FROM SMILING AS ANY MORTAL IS INCLINED TO DO AT THE SIGHT OF PRETTY ROUND THINGS
GET A BLANKET AND MAKE IT HOT AS THE FIRE IN REALITY ADAM WAS CONVINCED THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD BUT HE KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF REPRESSING HIS MOTHER'S IMPETUOUS WAILING GRIEF THAN BY OCCUPYING HER WITH SOME ACTIVE TASK WHICH HAD HOPE IN IT
BRIGHT FEBRUARY DAYS HAVE A STRONGER CHARM OF HOPE ABOUT THEM THAN ANY OTHER DAYS IN THE YEAR
NEVER MIND THE DOGS
MY AUNT AND THE MISS IRWINES WILL COME UP AND SEE YOU PRESENTLY
BUT HETTY'S WAS NOT A NATURE TO FACE DIFFICULTIES--TO DARE TO LOOSE HER HOLD ON THE FAMILIAR AND RUSH BLINDLY ON SOME UNKNOWN CONDITION
HE'LL NEVER TURN ROUND AND KNOCK DOWN HIS OWN WORK AND FORSAKE THEM AS IT'S BEEN THE LABOUR OF HIS LIFE TO STAND BY DONNA TALK TO ME ABOUT'S MARR'IN SAID LISBETH CRYING AFRESH
BUT DID SHE LOVE HIM
THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TWO PARISHES WHO DERIVED DIGNITY FROM THEIR FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN FROM THEIR POCKET AND OF THESE BARTLE MASSEY WAS ONE
THEN THE KEY WAS TURNED AGAIN AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS
NAY I'M GOING TO TH SCHOOL HITHERTO GYP HAD KEPT HIS COMFORTABLE BED ONLY LIFTING UP HIS HEAD AND WATCHING ADAM MORE CLOSELY AS HE NOTICED THE OTHER WORKMEN DEPARTING
ADAM WAS STILL HOLDING HER HANDS AND LOOKING AT HER WITH ALMOST TREMBLING ANXIETY WHEN SHE TURNED HER GRAVE LOVING EYES ON HIS AND SAID IN RATHER A SAD VOICE ADAM THERE IS TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY AND THERE'S MANY OF THE BRETHREN AND SISTERS WHO HAVE GREATER STRENGTH THAN I HAVE AND FIND THEIR HEARTS ENLARGED BY THE CARES OF HUSBAND AND KINDRED
BUT HE'S A CUTE FELLOW WITH AN EYE THAT UD PICK THE NEEDLES OUT OF THE HAY IN NO TIME
WHOEVER REMEMBERS HOW MANY THINGS HE HAS DECLINED TO DO EVEN FOR HIMSELF RATHER THAN HAVE THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING ON OR TAKING OFF HIS BOOTS WILL NOT THINK THIS LAST DETAIL INSIGNIFICANT
YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER AS SHE LIES THERE IN SHAME AND MISERY AND HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT--HE SUFFERS NOTHING ADAM HE WILL KNOW--HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY
AND I'D EVER SUCH WORK TO MAKE HER STAND STILL HETTY WAS COMING DOWNSTAIRS AND MRS POYSER IN HER PLAIN BONNET AND SHAWL WAS STANDING BELOW
THE VOICE WAS STRANGE TO HER
I WORK IN IT MYSELF AND HAVE REASON TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THEREBY I HAVE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE
BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL...THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT...IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE
AND THE THOUGHT OF YOU HAD TAKEN HOLD OF ME SO THAT MY SOUL HAD LOST ITS FREEDOM AND WAS BECOMING ENSLAVED TO AN EARTHLY AFFECTION WHICH MADE ME ANXIOUS AND CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BEFALL MYSELF
NOTHING LIKE TAKING A FEW BUSHES AND DITCHES FOR EXORCISING A DEMON
I MUST BE SAFE AS YOU'VE PUT AN END TO WHAT OUGHT NEVER TO HA BEEN BEGUN
THERE'S PLENTY OF THESE BIG LUMBERING FELLOWS UD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THEIR A B C IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR BARTLE MASSEY
INDEED I KNOW THAT HIS MIND WAS NOT OF A SPECULATIVE NEGATIVE CAST AND HE WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE MISSED GOING TO CHURCH ON CHRISTMAS DAY EASTER SUNDAY AND WHISSUNTIDE BUT HE HAD A GENERAL IMPRESSION THAT PUBLIC WORSHIP AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES LIKE OTHER NON-PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENTS WERE INTENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD LEISURE
DO YOU REMEMBER PREACHING ON THE VILLAGE GREEN AT HAYSLOPE IN LOAMSHIRE YES SIR SURELY
BUT I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN MEN SINCE HIS DAY WHO HAVE RIDDEN A LONG WAY TO AVOID A RENCONTRE AND THEN GALLOPED HASTILY BACK LEST THEY SHOULD MISS IT
DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME
THEE KNOW'ST MORE O'S GOINGS NOR I DO ADAM WANTED TO GO AND MEET SETH BUT HE MUST CONTENT HIMSELF WITH WALKING ABOUT THE NEAR FIELDS AND GETTING SIGHT OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AN ACT OF VENGEANCE ON YOUR PART AGAINST ARTHUR WOULD SIMPLY BE ANOTHER EVIL ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER
I'M PUNISHED ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT NO SIR NO ADAM SAID LOOKING AT ARTHUR WITH MOURNFUL AFFECTION
STAID FORMAL MISS LYDIA HAD REQUESTED TO RESIGN THAT QUEENLY OFFICE TO THE ROYAL OLD LADY AND ARTHUR WAS PLEASED WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY OF GRATIFYING HIS GODMOTHER'S TASTE FOR STATELINESS
WHAT THAT PALE PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN I'VE SEEN AT POYSER'S
AT LAST SHE WAS AMONG THE FIELDS SHE HAD BEEN DREAMING OF ON A LONG NARROW PATHWAY LEADING TOWARDS A WOOD
HE MUST PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN VERY MUCH TO BLAME
COME NOW YOU CANNA DRAW BACK
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WOULD HARDLY BE SUCH A THING AS A METHODIST TO BE FOUND ABOUT HERE
AND THERE WENT PLENTY O PRIDE AND TEMPER TO THE STROKES AS THE DEVIL WILL BE HAVING HIS FINGER IN WHAT WE CALL OUR DUTIES AS WELL AS OUR SINS
THAT WAS CAPITAL ADVICE OF YOURS IRWINE ABOUT THE DINNERS--TO LET THEM BE AS ORDERLY AND COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE AND ONLY FOR THE TENANTS
DINAH KNEW IT AND DID NOT FEEL AGGRIEVED
ARE YOU THE GENTLEMAN THAT STAYED TO LISTEN ON HORSEBACK YES
AND I CAME TO A HAYSTACK WHERE I THOUGHT I COULD LIE DOWN AND KEEP MYSELF WARM ALL NIGHT
MR POYSER AND THE GRANDFATHER SAT ON THE SEAT IN FRONT AND WITHIN THERE WAS ROOM FOR ALL THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
AT THE GATE OF THE HOME CLOSE THERE WAS HALF THE DAIRY OF COWS STANDING ONE BEHIND THE OTHER EXTREMELY SLOW TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR LARGE BODIES MIGHT BE IN THE WAY
AH
AH
AH
AH
AH
PERHAPS THEY WOULD HELP HER TO GET THE MONEY FOR THESE THINGS
NOW BUT FOR THE HANDSOME BRICK WALL WITH STONE COPING THAT RAN ALONG ONE SIDE OF IT A TRUE FARMHOUSE GARDEN WITH HARDY PERENNIAL FLOWERS UNPRUNED FRUIT-TREES AND KITCHEN VEGETABLES GROWING TOGETHER IN CARELESS HALF-NEGLECTED ABUNDANCE
BUT YE WOULDNA HA ME GET CONVERTED AN CHOP IN ATWEEN YE AN THE PRETTY PREACHER AN CARRY HER AFF NO FEAR O THAT BEN
BUT WHICH WAY COULD SHE TURN
FOR I UNDERSTAND YOU PREACHED AT HAYSLOPE LAST NIGHT I FIRST TOOK TO THE WORK FOUR YEARS SINCE WHEN I WAS TWENTY-ONE YOUR SOCIETY SANCTIONS WOMEN'S PREACHING THEN IT DOESN'T FORBID THEM SIR WHEN THEY'VE A CLEAR CALL TO THE WORK AND WHEN THEIR MINISTRY IS OWNED BY THE CONVERSION OF SINNERS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF GOD'S PEOPLE
AND THIS AFTERNOON THE DOG-ROSES WERE TOSSING OUT THEIR PINK WREATHS THE NIGHTSHADE WAS IN ITS YELLOW AND PURPLE GLORY THE PALE HONEYSUCKLE GREW OUT OF REACH PEEPING HIGH UP OUT OF A HOLLY BUSH AND OVER ALL AN ASH OR A SYCAMORE EVERY NOW AND THEN THREW ITS SHADOW ACROSS THE PATH
BUT I REPROACHED HIM WITH HIS WRONG ACTIONS AND WORDS AND BLOWS PASSED BETWEEN US
WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S THIS SAID OLD MR DONNITHORNE
WE SEE HE IS GREAT AND MIGHTY AND CAN DO WHAT HE WILL
LISBETH HAD EVEN MENDED A LONG-NEGLECTED AND UNNOTICEABLE RENT IN THE CHECKERED BIT OF BED-CURTAIN
ARTHUR TURNED HIS EYES ON ADAM WITH A VAGUE STARE WHICH GAVE WAY TO A SLIGHTLY STARTLED MOTION AS IF FROM THE SHOCK OF RETURNING MEMORY
BUT THE INCIDENT ON HER WAKING THIS MORNING HEIGHTENED HER DREAD OF THAT TIME WHEN HER MONEY WOULD BE ALL GONE
AND I THINK IT UD BE WELL FOR YOU TO TAKE A LITTLE BOTTLE O RUM FOR TH OLD WOMAN FOR I DARESAY SHE'S GOT NEVER A DROP O NOTHING TO COMFORT HER INSIDE
MY LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND GOD'S WORK IS TOO GREAT FOR ME TO THINK OF MAKING A HOME FOR MYSELF IN THIS WORLD
HOW DO YE DO MISTRESS BEDE MR CRAIG CONTINUED WITHOUT A PAUSE NODDING BY THE WAY TO ADAM AND SETH
AND IF YOU LIKE TO SEND IT ME BACK AND GET THE JEWELLERY AGAIN YOU CAN YOU KNOW
BUT NO MORE WE CAN OF THE SPROUTING O THE SEED FOR THAT MATTER CHAPTER XII IN THE WOOD THAT SAME THURSDAY MORNING AS ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WAS MOVING ABOUT IN HIS DRESSING-ROOM SEEING HIS WELL-LOOKING BRITISH PERSON REFLECTED IN THE OLD-FASHIONED MIRRORS AND STARED AT FROM A DINGY OLIVE-GREEN PIECE OF TAPESTRY BY PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDENS WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MINDING THE INFANT MOSES HE WAS HOLDING A DISCUSSION WITH HIMSELF WHICH BY THE TIME HIS VALET WAS TYING THE BLACK SILK SLING OVER HIS SHOULDER HAD ISSUED IN A DISTINCT PRACTICAL RESOLUTION
ARE YOU INCLINED TO ASK WHETHER THIS CAN BE THE SAME ARTHUR WHO TWO MONTHS AGO HAD THAT FRESHNESS OF FEELING THAT DELICATE HONOUR WHICH SHRINKS FROM WOUNDING EVEN A SENTIMENT AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE ANY MORE POSITIVE OFFENCE AS POSSIBLE FOR IT?--WHO THOUGHT THAT HIS OWN SELF-RESPECT WAS A HIGHER TRIBUNAL THAN ANY EXTERNAL OPINION
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE REPROACHED HIMSELF--IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE WERE REJOICING IN HIS FATHER'S SAD DEATH
THAT'S A SONG I'M UNCOMMON FOND ON PEEH SAID MR CRAIG
COME LET US SHAKE HANDS ARTHUR HELD OUT HIS HAND BUT ADAM SAT STILL
HE HAD HEARD THE SOUND OF THE TOOLS AS HE WAS APPROACHING
IF NOT THEN NEITHER IS IT A WEAKNESS TO BE SO WROUGHT UPON BY THE EXQUISITE CURVES OF A WOMAN'S CHEEK AND NECK AND ARMS BY THE LIQUID DEPTHS OF HER BESEECHING EYES OR THE SWEET CHILDISH POUT OF HER LIPS
HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER
YET THERE WAS ONE THING ON HIS MIND TO BE DONE BEFORE HE COULD RECUR TO REMONSTRANCE
AT LAST AS THEY WERE NEARLY AT THE YARD-GATE HE SAID WELL DINAH I MUST SEEK FOR STRENGTH TO BEAR IT AND TO ENDURE AS SEEING HIM WHO IS INVISIBLE
THE CARTS OF COURSE WERE NOT TO ENTER THE CHASE
BUT ON THIS CLOTH THERE IS A MASSIVE SILVER WAITER WITH A DECANTER OF WATER ON IT OF THE SAME PATTERN AS TWO LARGER ONES THAT ARE PROPPED UP ON THE SIDEBOARD WITH A COAT OF ARMS CONSPICUOUS IN THEIR CENTRE
IT HAD A FIRM MAHOGANY BASE WELL SUPPLIED WITH DRAWERS WHICH OPENED WITH A DECIDED JERK AND SENT THE CONTENTS LEAPING OUT FROM THE FARTHEST CORNERS WITHOUT GIVING YOU THE TROUBLE OF REACHING THEM
I'M SURE HE NEVER DID
THEE'T SEE HETTY LL BE ALL RIGHT WHEN SHE'S GOT A GOOD HUSBAND AND CHILDREN OF HER OWN I DON'T WANT TO BE HARD UPO THE GELL
THE POOR CHILD NO MORE CONCEIVED AT PRESENT THE IDEA THAT THE YOUNG SQUIRE COULD EVER BE HER LOVER THAN A BAKER'S PRETTY DAUGHTER IN THE CROWD WHOM A YOUNG EMPEROR DISTINGUISHES BY AN IMPERIAL BUT ADMIRING SMILE CONCEIVES THAT SHE SHALL BE MADE EMPRESS
ARTHUR HAD PUT ON HIS UNIFORM TO PLEASE THE TENANTS HE SAID WHO THOUGHT AS MUCH OF HIS MILITIA DIGNITY AS IF IT HAD BEEN AN ELEVATION TO THE PREMIERSHIP
TO LISTEN FOR HER VOICE AS FOR A RECURRENT MUSIC
I EXPECT IT FROM YOUR STRENGTH OF MIND ADAM--FROM YOUR SENSE OF DUTY TO GOD AND MAN--THAT YOU WILL TRY TO ACT AS LONG AS ACTION CAN BE OF ANY USE IN REALITY MR IRWINE PROPOSED THIS JOURNEY TO STONITON FOR ADAM'S OWN SAKE
THEY SEEMED TO HEM IN AND PRESS DOWN UPON HIM ALL THE CROWD OF CONTRADICTORY THOUGHTS AND CONFLICTING FEELINGS SOME OF WHICH WOULD FLY AWAY IN THE OPEN AIR
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT DIVINE GIFT THAT GAVE A DEEPER PATHOS TO THE NEED THE SIN THE SORROW WITH WHICH IT WAS MINGLED AS THE CANKER IN A LILY-WHITE BUD IS MORE GRIEVOUS TO BEHOLD THAN IN A COMMON POT-HERB
THEY WERE WAITING FOR ADAM TO COME UP NOT BEING CONTENTED TO GO AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A KIND WORD TO THE WIDOW AND HER SONS
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT COULD BE A GOOD
WINDSOR MUST BE PRETTY NIGH LONDON FOR IT'S WHERE THE KING LIVES WAS THE ANSWER
SHE'D GOT A BIG PIECE OF BREAD ON HER LAP ADAM HAD GIVEN A FAINT GROAN OF DESPAIR WHILE THIS WITNESS WAS SPEAKING
IT'S POOR EATING WHERE THE FLAVOUR O THE MEAT LIES I THE CRUETS
HOW BUSY HIS THOUGHTS WERE AS HE WALKED HOME IN DEVISING PITYING EXCUSES FOR HER FOLLY IN REFERRING ALL HER WEAKNESS TO THE SWEET LOVINGNESS OF HER NATURE IN BLAMING ARTHUR WITH LESS AND LESS INCLINATION TO ADMIT THAT HIS CONDUCT MIGHT BE EXTENUATED TOO
THE CEREMONY CONNECTED WITH THE SONG WAS A DRINKING CEREMONY
HE WAS A BROAD-CHESTED FELLOW WITH A FERVID TEMPERAMENT WHICH HELPED HIM BETTER IN IMBIBING RELIGIOUS IDEAS THAN IN THE DRY PROCESS OF ACQUIRING THE MERE HUMAN KNOWLEDGE OF THE ALPHABET
AND IT'S MUCH IF SHE'LL EVER LIKE A COMMON MAN NOW HE COULD NOT HELP DRAWING HIS OWN HANDS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND LOOKING AT THEM--AT THE HARD PALMS AND THE BROKEN FINGER-NAILS
GREAT WAS THE SHOUTING OF THE CROWD RADIANT THE GRINNING OF BILL DOWNES THE STONE-SAWYER AND THE FORTUNATE RIDER OF THIS SUPERIOR BEAST WHICH STOOD CALM AND STIFF-LEGGED IN THE MIDST OF ITS TRIUMPH
HETTY WOULD NOT CARE TO PUT THE LARGE COLOURED GLASS EAR-RINGS INTO HER EARS NOW
CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE COULDN'T LIKE HER TO GO ON DOING WORK
YOU WOULDNA LIKE YOUR GRAND-CHILD TO TAKE WAGE NA-A-Y SAID OLD MARTIN WITH AN ELONGATION OF THE WORD MEANT TO MAKE IT BITTER AS WELL AS NEGATIVE WHILE HE LEANED FORWARD AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
TH OULD FOULKS HA HAD THEIR TURN
WHAT ART GOIN TO DO SHE SAID RATHER PEEVISHLY
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY SINCE HE HAD COME TO WINDSOR HE WAS IN TRUE BOYISH SPIRITS
TOM SAFT--THE ROGUE--TOOK CARE TO SPILL A LITTLE BY ACCIDENT
WHY THE SWEETHEART AS YOU'VE LEFT BEHIND OR ELSE HIM AS YOU'RE GOIN ARTER--WHICH IS IT HETTY FELT HER FACE FLUSHING AND THEN TURNING PALE
WE MUST WAIT TO BE GUIDED BUT YOU'D LET ME WRITE YOU A LETTER DINAH IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I WANTED TO TELL YOU YES SURE
I WISH I COULD GO WITH YOU AND TAKE CARE OF YOU HETTY HE SAID THE NEXT MORNING LEANING IN AT THE COACH DOOR
THEE MIGHTST KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO TIS I'D LIKE T HA WI ME
NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH
I SAY NOTHING NOW ONLY THAT HIS PUNISHMENT IS IN OTHER HANDS THAN OURS MR IRWINE FELT IT HARD UPON HIM THAT HE SHOULD HAVE TO TELL OF ARTHUR'S SAD PART IN THE STORY OF SIN AND SORROW--HE WHO CARED FOR ARTHUR WITH FATHERLY AFFECTION WHO HAD CARED FOR HIM WITH FATHERLY PRIDE
I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR...DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MR IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION I SPOKE OF YOU
BUT HE WON'T MAKE US THINK HIM AN HONEST MAN BECAUSE HE BEGINS TO HOWL AT THE BANK-NOTE FOR FALLING IN HIS WAY BUT SURELY YOU DON'T THINK A MAN WHO STRUGGLES AGAINST A TEMPTATION INTO WHICH HE FALLS AT LAST AS BAD AS THE MAN WHO NEVER STRUGGLES AT ALL NO CERTAINLY
WHAT'S THE USE O LAW WHEN A MAN'S ONCE SUCH A FOOL AS TO LET A WOMAN INTO HIS HOUSE SAID BARTLE TURNING AWAY FROM THE HAMPER WITH SOME BITTERNESS
MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US
AND SHE MUST NOT BE SILLY
I'LL GO TO THE HERMITAGE--I THINK I'VE GOT SOME BRANDY THERE
BUT HE'S A LITTLE LIFTED UP AN PEPPERY-LIKE WELL GOOD EVENING TO YOU LANDLORD
PEASE PUT IT DOWN TO WARM THE SMALL CHIRRUPING VOICE THAT UTTERED THIS REQUEST CAME FROM A LITTLE SUNNY-HAIRED GIRL BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR WHO SEATED ON A HIGH CHAIR AT THE END OF THE IRONING TABLE WAS ARDUOUSLY CLUTCHING THE HANDLE OF A MINIATURE IRON WITH HER TINY FAT FIST AND IRONING RAGS WITH AN ASSIDUITY THAT REQUIRED HER TO PUT HER LITTLE RED TONGUE OUT AS FAR AS ANATOMY WOULD ALLOW
IT'S AMAZING WHAT PRETTY GIRLS ONE SEES AMONG THE FARMERS DAUGHTERS WHEN THE MEN ARE SUCH CLOWNS
HE WOULD CARRY HETTY AWAY AND ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS MIGHT GO TO
THEY'RE CUR'OUS TALKERS I THIS COUNTRY SIR
THE GREAT PROVENCE ROSES HAD BEEN CRUELLY TOSSED BY THE WIND AND BEATEN BY THE RAIN AND ALL THE DELICATE-STEMMED BORDER FLOWERS HAD BEEN DASHED DOWN AND STAINED WITH THE WET SOIL
COME NOW HE WENT ON BRINGING FORWARD THE BOTTLE AND THE LOAF AND POURING SOME WINE INTO A CUP I MUST HAVE A BIT AND A SUP MYSELF
AND POOR AGED FRETFUL LISBETH WITHOUT GRASPING ANY DISTINCT IDEA WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANY COURSE OF RELIGIOUS EMOTIONS FELT A VAGUE SENSE OF GOODNESS AND LOVE AND OF SOMETHING RIGHT LYING UNDERNEATH AND BEYOND ALL THIS SORROWING LIFE
THEY HAD MADE HER LOOK MORE PALE AND WORN THAN ALL THE TIME OF HIDDEN DREAD SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT HOME
AND UNDER ALL A FINE EAR DISCERNS THE CONTINUOUS HUM OF HUMAN VOICES
AND SO THIS KINDNESS O YOURS I'M SURE IS NO DEBT YOU OWE ME BUT A FREE GIFT AND AS SUCH I ACCEPT IT AND AM THANKFUL
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HE CARES FOR US ANY MORE THAN WE CARE FOR THE WORMS AND THINGS IN THE GARDEN SO AS WE REAR OUR CARROTS AND ONIONS
PLEASE TO GIVE MY DUTY TO HER AND TO MISS KATE AND MISS ANNE
THEE WAST OFTEN ANGERED WI THY FEYTHER WHEN HE WAR ALIVE
THAT IS GOOD FOR OTHER WOMEN AND IT IS A GREAT AND A BLESSED THING TO BE A WIFE AND MOTHER
WHY MOTHER DOST THINK I DON'T SET STORE BY DINAH NAY SAID LISBETH FRIGHTENED AT HER OWN COURAGE YET FEELING THAT SHE HAD BROKEN THE ICE AND THE WATERS MUST FLOW WHATEVER MISCHIEF THEY MIGHT DO
GOOD EVENIN THE TRAVELLER PUT HIS HORSE INTO A QUICK WALK UP THE VILLAGE BUT WHEN HE APPROACHED THE GREEN THE BEAUTY OF THE VIEW THAT LAY ON HIS RIGHT HAND THE SINGULAR CONTRAST PRESENTED BY THE GROUPS OF VILLAGERS WITH THE KNOT OF METHODISTS NEAR THE MAPLE AND PERHAPS YET MORE CURIOSITY TO SEE THE YOUNG FEMALE PREACHER PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS ANXIETY TO GET TO THE END OF HIS JOURNEY AND HE PAUSED
BLESS ME
BLESS ME
LYDIA MY DEAR IF YOU MUST SPEND MONEY ON THESE THINGS WHY DON'T YOU GET THEM AT ROSSETER INSTEAD OF PAYING DOUBLE PRICE FOR CLUMSY WORK HERE
THERE MUST BE AN END TO THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE
SHE CAN'T HA LOVED ME
THAT'S WHAT A MAN WANTS IN A WIFE MOSTLY
THIS IS BESSY CRANAGE MOTHER SAID MR IRWINE KINDLY CHAD CRANAGE'S DAUGHTER
IT WAS RIGHT THAT THINGS SHOULD LOOK STRANGE AND DISORDERED AND WRETCHED NOW THE OLD MAN HAD COME TO HIS END IN THAT SAD WAY
TOMMY WHO WAS OF A SUSCEPTIBLE DISPOSITION AND VERY FOND OF HIS MOTHER AND WHO HAD BESIDES EATEN SO MANY CHERRIES AS TO HAVE HIS FEELINGS LESS UNDER COMMAND THAN USUAL WAS SO AFFECTED BY THE DREADFUL PICTURE SHE HAD MADE OF THE POSSIBLE FUTURE THAT HE BEGAN TO CRY
CHAPTER XXX THE DELIVERY OF THE LETTER THE NEXT SUNDAY ADAM JOINED THE POYSERS ON THEIR WAY OUT OF CHURCH HOPING FOR AN INVITATION TO GO HOME WITH THEM
IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS OVER IT WELL SAID ADAM I DARESAY THERE'D BE MORE REJOICING THAN SORROW IN THE PARISH AT HIS BEING LAID UP
IT A'MOST MAKES YOUR FINGERS ITCH TO BE AT THE HAY NOW THE SUN SHINES SO HE OBSERVED AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE BIG MEADOW BUT IT'S POOR FOOLISHNESS TO THINK O SAVING BY GOING AGAINST YOUR CONSCIENCE
WE'VE NOTHING TO DO BUT TO OBEY AND TO TRUST
HE WAS PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS AND THE TIME SEEMED LONG TO ADAM
THE SECRET OF OUR EMOTIONS NEVER LIES IN THE BARE OBJECT BUT IN ITS SUBTLE RELATIONS TO OUR OWN PAST
I SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT IS SIR FOR I'VE LIVED BUTLER THERE A-GOING I FIFTEEN YEAR
ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN
HE SHOULD HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK BEHIND HIM
AND IT IS THESE PEOPLE--AMONGST WHOM YOUR LIFE IS PASSED--THAT IT IS NEEDFUL YOU SHOULD TOLERATE PITY AND LOVE
BUT ADAM HAD BEEN QUITE ENOUGH IN THE OPEN AIR TO WISH TO SHORTEN HIS WAY HOME AND HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT HE MIGHT DO SO BY STRIKING ACROSS THE CHASE AND GOING THROUGH THE GROVE WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN FOR YEARS
I'M A POOR MAN AS YET BUT SHE SHALL WANT NOTHING AS I CAN WORK FOR OBJECTIONS SAID MR POYSER WHILE THE GRANDFATHER LEANED FORWARD AND BROUGHT OUT HIS LONG NAY NAY WHAT OBJECTIONS CAN WE HA TO YOU LAD
AND ON MONDAY WHEN I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU--WHEN MY ARMS CAN'T REACH YOU--WHEN DEATH HAS PARTED US--HE WHO IS WITH US NOW AND KNOWS ALL WILL BE WITH YOU THEN
IT WAS TOO ODIOUS TOO UNLIKE HIM
IT WAS NOT A GROVE WITH MEASURED GRASS OR ROLLED GRAVEL FOR YOU TO TREAD UPON BUT WITH NARROW HOLLOW-SHAPED EARTHY PATHS EDGED WITH FAINT DASHES OF DELICATE MOSS--PATHS WHICH LOOK AS IF THEY WERE MADE BY THE FREE WILL OF THE TREES AND UNDERWOOD MOVING REVERENTLY ASIDE TO LOOK AT THE TALL QUEEN OF THE WHITE-FOOTED NYMPHS
IT WAS THE DEPTH OF HIS REVERENCE QUITE AS MUCH AS HIS HARD COMMON SENSE WHICH GAVE HIM HIS DISINCLINATION TO DOCTRINAL RELIGION AND HE OFTEN CHECKED SETH'S ARGUMENTATIVE SPIRITUALISM BY SAYING EH IT'S A BIG MYSTERY
HE SAW INSTEAD A FOREGROUND WHICH WAS JUST AS LOVELY--THE LEVEL SUNLIGHT LYING LIKE TRANSPARENT GOLD AMONG THE GENTLY CURVING STEMS OF THE FEATHERED GRASS AND THE TALL RED SORREL AND THE WHITE AMBELS OF THE HEMLOCKS LINING THE BUSHY HEDGEROWS
HE DIDN'T GO INTO DEEP SPERITIAL EXPERIENCE
IT WAS A SMALL OVAL FACE OF A UNIFORM TRANSPARENT WHITENESS WITH AN EGG-LIKE LINE OF CHEEK AND CHIN A FULL BUT FIRM MOUTH A DELICATE NOSTRIL AND A LOW PERPENDICULAR BROW SURMOUNTED BY A RISING ARCH OF PARTING BETWEEN SMOOTH LOCKS OF PALE REDDISH HAIR
AH SAID ADAM LOOKING AT IT CAREFULLY HERE'S A NICE BIT O TURNING WANTED
IT WAS AN EVENT MUCH THOUGHT OF IN THE VILLAGE
A PUZZLED ALARM HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER PAIR OF DARK EYES THAT FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO WANDER THITHER AND REST ON THAT ROUND PINK-AND-WHITE FIGURE
LET ME HOLD HER SAID ADAM AS MOLLY TURNED UPSTAIRS
AS POOR A TWO-FISTED THING AS EVER I SAW YOU KNOW YOU WAS
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME PATIENTLY YES SIR SAID ADAM AFTER SOME HESITATION
HERE'S A HEALTH UNTO OUR MASTER AND TO OUR MISTRESS
AN HIM AS KNOW'D WHAT GOOD WORK WAR AN'S GOT A SON AS IS THE HEAD O THE VILLAGE AN ALL TREDDLES'ON TOO FOR CLEVERNESS VERY WELL MOTHER IF THAT'S THY WISH I'LL MAKE THE COFFIN AT HOME
AN YOUNG ENOUGH TOO
THY FIGURIN BOOKS MIGHT HA TOULD THEE BETTER NOR THAT I SHOULD THINK ELSE THEE MIGHTST AS WELL READ THE COMMIN PRINT AS SETH ALLAYS DOES NAY MOTHER SAID ADAM LAUGHING THE FIGURES TELL US A FINE DEAL AND WE COULDN'T GO FAR WITHOUT EM BUT THEY DON'T TELL US ABOUT FOLKS'S FEELINGS
YOU'LL COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN NOW WILL YOU MR POYSER PAUSED AND LOOKED ROUND WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING AS IF TO SEE WHERE HETTY WAS
SUPPOSE WE HAVE A CANTER NOW WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL THAT IS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF DIALOGUE ON HORSEBACK
AND IF WE WISE PEOPLE MAKE EMINENT FOOLS OF OURSELVES ON ANY PARTICULAR OCCASION WE MUST ENDURE THE LEGITIMATE CONCLUSION THAT WE CARRY A FEW GRAINS OF FOLLY TO OUR OUNCE OF WISDOM WELL BUT ONE MAY BE BETRAYED INTO DOING THINGS BY A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ONE MIGHT NEVER HAVE DONE OTHERWISE WHY YES A MAN CAN'T VERY WELL STEAL A BANK-NOTE UNLESS THE BANK-NOTE LIES WITHIN CONVENIENT REACH
WELL DEAR FRIENDS WHO WAS THIS MAN
GOOD-DAY MRS POYSER SAID THE OLD SQUIRE PEERING AT HER WITH HIS SHORT-SIGHTED EYES--A MODE OF LOOKING AT HER WHICH AS MRS POYSER OBSERVED ALLAYS AGGRAVATED ME
I THINK YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS TO SCORE THEIR OWN DRINK DO YOU
BUT ALL THE REST GAVE A HEARTY SHAKE TO THE LARGE PALM THAT WAS HELD OUT TO THEM AND SAID COME AGAIN COME AGAIN AYE THINK O THAT NOW SAID MR POYSER WHEN ADAM WAS OUT OF ON THE CAUSEWAY
I WISH I HAD SOME PRETTY EAR-RINGS SHE SAID IN A MOMENT ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS SAYING--THE WISH LAY SO CLOSE TO HER LIPS IT WOULD FLUTTER PAST THEM AT THE SLIGHTEST BREATH
FOR HE HAD SEEN ADAM IN THE WORST MOMENTS OF HIS SORROW
SETH MEANWHILE WENT OUT TO CHOP WOOD FOR HE SURMISED THAT DINAH WOULD LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS MOTHER
THEY ALL RETURNED TO THEIR WORK NOW
SHE THOUGHT NOTHING ABOUT HOW SHE MIGHT GET A CLEAN HEART AND A RIGHT SPIRIT--SHE ONLY WANTED TO HAVE BETTER LACE THAN OTHER GIRLS
AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT IF HETTY HAD BEEN PLAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LOOKED VERY UGLY AND UNAMIABLE AT THAT MOMENT AND NO ONE'S MORAL JUDGMENT UPON HER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LEAST BEGUILED
YOU'RE NOT WELL ENOUGH TO WALK ALONE SIR SAID ADAM
SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR A MAN WITH CATARACT TO REGRET THE PAINFUL PROCESS BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY
THE SOUND OF TOOLS TO A CLEVER WORKMAN WHO LOVES HIS WORK IS LIKE THE TENTATIVE SOUNDS OF THE ORCHESTRA TO THE VIOLINIST WHO HAS TO BEAR HIS PART IN THE OVERTURE
FOR THE CHILDREN WERE RUNNING ON BEFORE
HE IS UNWILLING TO LEAVE THE SPOT WHERE SHE IS DO YOU THINK THE CREATUR'S GUILTY THEN SAID BARTLE
NOT A CHIP
FOR MY OWN PART I THINK THE SOONER SUCH WOMEN ARE PUT OUT O THE WORLD THE BETTER
BUT IT'S NO USE SETTING THY MIND ON WHAT CAN'T BE
I'VE FINISHED MY DOOR TO-DAY ANYHOW THE WORKMEN ALL LOOKED UP
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT PINK AND WHITE ABOUT HER EXCEPT IN HER DARK HAIR AND EYES AND HER LITTLE BUCKLED SHOES
THE DESIRE TO LISTEN WAS SUSPENDED AND EVERY ONE HAD SOME FEELING OR OPINION TO EXPRESS IN UNDERTONES
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED AT THIS DARKNESS--FRIGHTENED AT THE LONG NIGHT BEFORE HER
SO YOU'RE COME TO SEE DINAH MORRIS SAID THE OLD WOMAN STANDING OPPOSITE TO HIM
HE'S TROUBLESOME TO THEE SO NAY NAY
THERE IS A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF SUSTENANCE IN THE FIRST FEW WORDS OF LOVE
HOW COULD YOU THINK SO I COULDN'T BEAR YOU NOT TO FEEL AS MUCH A FRIEND TO ME AS I DO TO YOU SAID ADAM
SHE SPOKE SLOWLY THOUGH QUITE FLUENTLY OFTEN PAUSING AFTER A QUESTION OR BEFORE ANY TRANSITION OF IDEAS
OH HOW SHE YEARNED TO BE AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY WHO WOULD CARE FOR HER
I'VE BEEN FORCED T HAVE NANCY IN UPO COUNT AS HETTY MUST GETHER THE RED CURRANTS TO-NIGHT
THAT WAS THE REASON THIS CONFESSION WAS VERY AWKWARD AND SUDDEN ADAM FELT FOR HE THOUGHT DINAH MUST UNDERSTAND ALL HE MEANT
AS DINAH EXPRESSED IT SHE WAS NEVER LEFT TO HERSELF
WE'LL HAVE NO NAY SHE'S NO CALL TO BE IN A HURRY OBSERVED MRS POYSER
I OFFENDED HIM ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND HE'S NEVER FORGIVEN ME WHY HOW WAS THAT
YOU'D HARDLY EVER BRING ROUND TH OLD SQUIRE TO BELIEVE HE'D GAIN AS MUCH IN A STRAIGHTFOR'ARD WAY AS BY TRICKS AND TURNS
BUT LET US SAY GOOD-NIGHT"--ARTHUR HERE TURNED ROUND TO WALK ON--"AND TALK NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
PERHAPS I CAN LET YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM IT'S CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SAID HETTY TREMULOUSLY HER HEART BEGINNING TO BEAT PAINFULLY AT THIS DISAPPOINTMENT OF HER HOPE THAT SHE SHOULD FIND ARTHUR AT ONCE
BUT HE PAUSED NOW TO RUB HIS MOIST FOREHEAD AND PROBABLY HIS MOIST EYES ALSO
SETH LINGERED AND LOOKED WISTFULLY AT ADAM AS IF HE EXPECTED HIM TO SAY SOMETHING
BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE--IT IS NEVER OPENED
IT WAS KNOWLEDGE TO BE ACTED ON AS MUCH AS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DAMP WILL CAUSE RUST
GOD HELP HIM WHO HAS THE TWO PALE FACES LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
NAY BUT IT'S OFTEN FULL O DRINK AND THAT'S WORSE BEN HOWEVER HAD NOW GOT THE RED POT IN HIS HAND AND WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN WRITING HIS INSCRIPTION MAKING BY WAY OF PRELIMINARY AN IMAGINARY S IN THE AIR
SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
AND I WAS PARTICULARLY SORRY NOT TO HAVE YOU AT CHURCH YESTERDAY AH MY BOY I KNOW WHY I KNOW WHY SAID BARTLE KINDLY GOING UP TO ADAM AND RAISING HIS HAND UP TO THE SHOULDER THAT WAS ALMOST ON A LEVEL WITH HIS OWN HEAD
THEE WOTNA LET NOBODY MAKE THY FEYTHER'S COFFIN BUT THYSEN
BUT DINAH WALKED AS SIMPLY AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO MARKET AND SEEMED AS UNCONSCIOUS OF HER OUTWARD APPEARANCE AS A LITTLE BOY
SAW HER IN HEIGHTENED BEAUTY BECAUSE HE HEARD HER BEAUTY PRAISED--FOR OTHER MEN'S OPINION YOU KNOW WAS LIKE A NATIVE CLIMATE TO ARTHUR'S FEELINGS
THAT'S LIKE A BABBY
YEA MY OLD MAN WONNA COME BACK TO ME BUT I SHALL GO TO HIM--THE SOONER THE BETTER
I COULD HA GI'EN EM PLENTY
SHE ENTERS THE WOOD WHERE IT IS ALREADY TWILIGHT AND AT EVERY STEP SHE TAKES THE FEAR AT HER HEART BECOMES COLDER
I CAN'T GO TO WORK AGAIN WHILE SHE'S HERE AND I COULDN'T BEAR THE SIGHT O THE THINGS AND FOLKS ROUND HOME
SHE HAD BEEN LOVING ARTHUR ALL THE WHILE
BESIDES ONE WANTS THE STIMULUS OF SYMPATHY AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THAT SINCE POOR D'OYLEY LEFT TREDDLESTON
AND AS HE WAS STILL WINDING DOWN THE SLOPE THE VOICES OF THE METHODISTS REACHED HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THAT STRANGE BLENDING OF EXULTATION AND SADNESS WHICH BELONGS TO THE CADENCE OF A HYMN
HOW RELIEVED SHE WAS WHEN SHE HAD GOT SAFELY UNDER THE OAKS AND AMONG THE FERN OF THE CHASE
HETTY HAD THROWN OFF HER BONNET AND HER CURLS HAD FALLEN DOWN
I AM CARRIED AWAY TO THEM CONTINUALLY IN MY SLEEP AND OFTEN IN THE MIDST OF WORK AND EVEN OF SPEECH THE THOUGHT OF THEM IS BORNE IN ON ME AS IF THEY WERE IN NEED AND TROUBLE WHICH YET IS DARK TO ME
GIE HIM HERE TO ME JIM SAID CHAD CRANAGE
CHAPTER XXXI IN HETTY'S BED-CHAMBER IT WAS NO LONGER LIGHT ENOUGH TO GO TO BED WITHOUT A CANDLE EVEN IN MRS POYSER'S EARLY HOUSEHOLD AND HETTY CARRIED ONE WITH HER AS SHE WENT UP AT LAST TO HER BEDROOM SOON AFTER ADAM WAS GONE AND BOLTED THE DOOR BEHIND HER
AND WE MUST LEARN TO ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO THE DISCOVERY THAT SOME OF THOSE CUNNINGLY FASHIONED INSTRUMENTS CALLED HUMAN SOULS HAVE ONLY A VERY LIMITED RANGE OF MUSIC AND WILL NOT VIBRATE IN THE LEAST UNDER A TOUCH THAT FILLS OTHERS WITH TREMULOUS RAPTURE OR QUIVERING AGONY
I MADE HASTE BACK WITH IT OUT OF THE WOOD AND TOOK IT HOME TO MY WIFE
WHO'S TO SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE MR MASSEY WHY THE BROADEST MAN SAID BARTLE
HE'S ONLY I THE RICK-YARD
AN I WISH HE'D GET THE DEVIL TO DO'S GROOMING FOR'N GROWLED JOHN
WHAT ELSE COULD HE DO BUT SPEAK TO HER IN A SOFT SOOTHING TONE AS IF SHE WERE A BRIGHT-EYED SPANIEL WITH A THORN IN HER FOOT
SIT DOWN CHILD AND BE EASY FOR YOU SHAN'T STIR OUT TILL YOU'VE HAD A CUP O TEA AND SO I TELL YOU DURING THE LATTER PART OF THIS SPEECH MRS POYSER HAD BEEN REACHING DOWN THE TEA-THINGS FROM THE SHELVES AND WAS ON HER WAY TOWARDS THE PANTRY FOR THE LOAF FOLLOWED CLOSE BY TOTTY WHO HAD MADE HER APPEARANCE ON THE RATTLING OF THE TEA-CUPS WHEN HETTY CAME OUT OF THE DAIRY RELIEVING HER TIRED ARMS BY LIFTING THEM UP AND CLASPING HER HANDS AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD
OUR GOOD ADAM HAD NO FINE WORDS INTO WHICH HE COULD PUT HIS FEELING FOR HETTY
AFTER MANY CUTS WITH HIS WHIP AND GLANCES AT HETTY OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE HE LIFTED HIS LIPS ABOVE THE EDGE OF HIS WRAPPER AND SAID HE'S PRETTY NIGH SIX FOOT I'LL BE BOUND ISNA HE NOW WHO SAID HETTY RATHER STARTLED
I CAN CARRY HIM SO FOR A BIT A KINDNESS WHICH YOUNG ADDY ACKNOWLEDGED BY DRUMMING HIS HEELS WITH PROMISING FORCE AGAINST UNCLE SETH'S CHEST
AND SETH SAID HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD
BUT A CERTAIN AWE MINGLED ITSELF WITH HER IDOLATROUS LOVE OF ADAM AND WHEN HE SAID LEAVE ME ALONE SHE WAS ALWAYS SILENCED
WHILE HETTY WHO HAD LOOKED OUT OF SPIRITS WHEN HE MET HER SMILED AND TALKED AND WAITED ON THEM ALL WITH UNUSUAL PROMPTITUDE
I LIKE THESE PREMISES DO YOU KNOW BEYOND ANY ON THE ESTATE WELL SIR SINCE YOU'RE FOND OF EM I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S I THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE
WHAT A FOOL HE WAS FOR COMING BACK FROM GAWAINE'S
AND I MUST SET OUT ON ANOTHER JOURNEY DIRECTLY AFTER I'VE BEEN TO THE VILLAGE AND TH HALL FARM
MRS POYSER SEATED IN THE ROCKING-CHAIR WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT OF THE RIGHT-HAND PARLOUR WAS TRYING TO SOOTHE TOTTY TO SLEEP
HE KNEW EXACTLY HOW MANY GRAINS WERE GONE OUT OF THE EAR OF INDIAN CORN THAT HUNG FROM ONE OF THE RAFTERS
IF HE SHOULD EVER WANT TO DISPOSE OF THE BUSINESS THAT UD BE A DIFFERENT MATTER
YE'LL DO FINELY T LEAD THE SINGIN BUT I DON KNOW WHAT PARSON IRWINE ULL SAY AT HIS GRAN FAVRIGHT ADAM BEDE A-TURNIN METHODY NEVER DO YOU BOTHER YOURSELF ABOUT ME BEN
MUM TAFT WHO TRUE TO HIS NAME HAD KEPT SILENCE THROUGHOUT THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION HAD FLUNG DOWN HIS HAMMER AS HE WAS IN THE ACT OF LIFTING IT
I OVERTOOK PRETTY LITTLE HETTY SORREL AS I WAS COMING TO MY DEN--THE HERMITAGE THERE
I'VE NO MORE THOUGHTS ABOUT MYSELF IN THAT THING AND I SHALL TAKE IT HARD IF EVER THEE SAY'ST IT AGAIN WELL WELL THEN THEE SHOULDSTNA CROSS ME WI SAYIN THINGS ARENA AS I SAY THEY ARE BUT MOTHER SAID SETH THEE'DST BE DOING DINAH A WRONG BY TELLING ADAM WHAT THEE THINK'ST ABOUT HER
BUT SHE FELT THE DIVINE PRESENCE MORE AND MORE--NAY AS IF SHE HERSELF WERE A PART OF IT AND IT WAS THE DIVINE PITY THAT WAS BEATING IN HER HEART AND WAS WILLING THE RESCUE OF THIS HELPLESS ONE
AND BEFORE THE BELLS HAD FINISHED OTHER MUSIC WAS HEARD APPROACHING SO THAT EVEN OLD BROWN THE SOBER HORSE THAT WAS DRAWING MR POYSER'S CART BEGAN TO PRICK UP HIS EARS
THEE KNOW'ST BUT LITTLE ABOUT IT AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT ADAM WAS AT ONCE PENETRATING AND CREDULOUS
WON'T YOU
AN THERE'S THAT BLESSED CHILD--SOMETHING'S SURE T HAPPEN TO HER--THEY'LL LET HER TUMBLE INTO THE FIRE OR GET AT THE KETTLE WI THE BOILING LARD IN'T OR SOME MISCHIEF AS ULL LAME HER FOR LIFE
HETTY DID NOT TURN AWAY HER EYES
THEY WILL SOON BE IN THE PARISH OF HAYSLOPE
TH MEN NE'ER KNOW WHETHER THE FLOOR'S CLEANED OR CAT-LICKED
ARTHUR READ NO MORE
IF SHE THOUGHT THE LEADING WAS NOT FROM HIM SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE BROUGHT UNDER THE POWER OF IT
IF ANYTHING LIKE A QUESTION WAS VENTURED ON THIS SUBJECT BARTLE ALWAYS REPLIED OH I'VE SEEN MANY PLACES--I'VE BEEN A DEAL IN THE SOUTH AND THE LOAMSHIRE MEN WOULD AS SOON HAVE THOUGHT OF ASKING FOR A PARTICULAR TOWN OR VILLAGE IN AFRICA AS IN THE SOUTH NOW THEN MY BOY SAID BARTLE AT LAST WHEN HE HAD POURED OUT HIS SECOND MUG OF ALE AND LIGHTED HIS PIPE NOW THEN WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE TALK
NONSENSE SAID MR POYSER
WILL YOU PLEASE TO TAKE SOMETHING FOR YOUR TROUBLE HE LOOKED SLOWLY AT THE SIXPENCE AND THEN SAID I WANT NONE O YOUR MONEY
ELSE I'LL MA YE SING A TOON YE WONNA LIKE A GOOD-TEMPERED WAGGONER'S PATIENCE HAS LIMITS AND TIM WAS NOT TO BE URGED FURTHER
IT WAS HARD WORK POOR FELLOW--IT WAS HARD WORK
SIT DOWN YOU KNOW WHAT I'M COME ABOUT AS WELL AS I DO SIR I DARESAY SAID BARTLE
WHAT A PITY
TO FEEL ITS WONDROUS HARMONIES SEARCHING THE SUBTLEST WINDINGS OF YOUR SOUL THE DELICATE FIBRES OF LIFE WHERE NO MEMORY CAN PENETRATE AND BINDING TOGETHER YOUR WHOLE BEING PAST AND PRESENT IN ONE UNSPEAKABLE VIBRATION MELTING YOU IN ONE MOMENT WITH ALL THE TENDERNESS ALL THE LOVE THAT HAS BEEN SCATTERED THROUGH THE TOILSOME YEARS CONCENTRATING IN ONE EMOTION OF HEROIC COURAGE OR RESIGNATION ALL THE HARD-LEARNT LESSONS OF SELF-RENOUNCING SYMPATHY BLENDING YOUR PRESENT JOY WITH PAST SORROW AND YOUR PRESENT SORROW WITH ALL YOUR PAST JOY
IT WILL HAVE THE SOUL ALL TO ITSELF
WHY MR IRWINE WASN'T ANGRY THEN
HE WAS BITTERLY JEALOUS AND IN PROPORTION AS HIS LOVE MADE HIM INDULGENT IN HIS JUDGMENT OF HETTY THE BITTERNESS FOUND A VENT IN HIS FEELING TOWARDS ARTHUR
AND YET IT UD GO TO MY HEART IF HE WAS TO MARRY HER FOR I CANNA THINK AS SHE'D MAKE HIM HAPPY
AND IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO GO AMONG THE TENANTS HERE--THEY SEEM ALL SO WELL INCLINED TO ME I SUPPOSE IT SEEMS ONLY THE OTHER DAY TO THEM SINCE I WAS A LITTLE LAD RIDING ON A PONY ABOUT AS BIG AS A SHEEP
BUT WE HAVE SOME INTELLIGENT WORKMEN ABOUT HERE
LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF HE ISN'T HALF SO BAD AS A MEAN SELFISH COWARD AS MAKES THINGS EASY T HIMSELF AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM
A WOMAN WHO SENDS ME SUCH EXCELLENT CREAM-CHEESE IS NOT TO BE NEGLECTED
EVERY TIME SHE HAD SEEN HIM SINCE THE BIRTHDAY SHE HAD SEEMED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO BEHAVE ALL THE MORE KINDLY TO HIM THAT SHE MIGHT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND SHE HAD FORGIVEN HIS SILENCE AND COLDNESS DURING THE DANCE
AS THE NEW PROMISE OF HAPPINESS ROSE FOR ADAM HIS INDIGNATION AND JEALOUSY BEGAN TO DIE OUT
SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH-TONGUED PALAVER
I CAN SAY NO MORE ADAM SAID NOTHING BUT ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND STOOD WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS ONE OF THE WINDOWS AS IF LOOKING AT THE BLACKNESS OF THE MOONLIT FIR-TREES
HETTY'S EYES SEEMED TO BESEECH HIM NOT TO GO AWAY YET
AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR THEY'VE GOT NOTHING I THEIR INSIDES WHERE IS THE CAPTAIN AS HE WASNA AT CHURCH TO-DAY SAID ADAM
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR CHILDREN WI YOU
MAKE HER CRY WITH HER WHOLE SOUL FATHER I HAVE SINNED DINAH HETTY SOBBED OUT THROWING HER ARMS ROUND DINAH'S NECK I WILL SPEAK...I WILL TELL...I WON'T HIDE IT ANY MORE BUT THE TEARS AND SOBS WERE TOO VIOLENT
NO THERE WAS NOTHING BUT COMMON NEEDLES AND PINS AND DRIED TULIP-PETALS BETWEEN THE PAPER LEAVES WHERE SHE HAD WRITTEN DOWN HER LITTLE MONEY-ACCOUNTS
YOU MAY SEND ME WORD THAT YOU'RE HERE AT FIVE O'CLOCK SAID ARTHUR
MY BACK'S BROAD ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH
AND I FEEL IT WOULD BE A GREAT EVIL FOR YOU IF YOUR AFFECTIONS CONTINUED SO FIXED ON ME THAT YOU COULD THINK OF NO OTHER MAN WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER BY HIS LOVE THAN I EVER CAN AND IF YOU CONTINUED TO LOOK TOWARDS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN
THE SOONER I'M LAID UNDER THE THORN THE BETTER
SHE HAD NO EYES FOR HETTY AT THAT MOMENT AND ONLY SAID WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER YOU GO AND DRAW SOME ALE HETTY
THEN WITHOUT SPEAKING SHE NESTLED TO HER MOTHER AGAIN
NO WONDER
EH?...NO SAID THE OLD WOMAN LOOKING UP AT THIS TALL STRANGER WITH A WONDER THAT MADE HER SLOWER OF SPEECH THAN USUAL
SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF WHAT HE SAID--SHE HAD NOT LISTENED
YOU WON'T CRY AGAIN NOW I'M WITH YOU WILL YOU AH HE DOESN'T KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT HE IS SAYING
THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG
HE MUST BE ON HIS WAY HOME--OR WOULD BE LONG BEFORE YOU ARRIVED FOR HIS GRANDFATHER I KNOW WROTE FOR HIM TO COME AT LEAST TEN DAYS AGO
A PIG MAY POKE HIS NOSE INTO THE TROUGH AND THINK O NOTHING OUTSIDE IT
LET MY SON TAKE MY PLACE
THEY WERE SOON TO BE MARRIED
IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT FOR ME TO TELL YOU AT PRESENT
WIRY BEN WAS FEELING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ALMOST WISHING HE HAD NOT COME TO HEAR DINAH
IT'LL DO ME GOOD
AH WHAT PAIN
GOOD-BYE WITHOUT WAITING FOR HER TO SPEAK HE TURNED AWAY FROM HER AND HURRIED BACK TOWARDS THE ROAD THAT LED TO THE HERMITAGE LEAVING HETTY TO PURSUE HER WAY IN A STRANGE DREAM THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEGUN IN BEWILDERING DELIGHT AND WAS NOW PASSING INTO CONTRARIETIES AND SADNESS
ARTHUR HAD PASSED THE VILLAGE OF HAYSLOPE AND WAS APPROACHING THE BROXTON SIDE OF THE HILL WHEN AT A TURNING IN THE ROAD HE SAW A FIGURE ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS BEFORE HIM WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISTAKE FOR ANY ONE ELSE THAN ADAM BEDE EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO GREY TAILLESS SHEPHERD-DOG AT HIS HEELS
THE TENDER ADMIRATION IN ADAM'S FACE WAS SLIGHTLY SHADOWED BY RELUCTANT DISAPPROVAL
WELL MESTER TAFT SHOUTED OLD MARTIN AT THE UTMOST STRETCH OF HIS VOICE--FOR THOUGH HE KNEW THE OLD MAN WAS STONE DEAF HE COULD NOT OMIT THE PROPRIETY OF A GREETING--"YOU'RE HEARTY YET
YOU'RE PRETTY WELL KNOCKED UP I CAN SEE THAT HE TOOK HER INTO THE BAR AND SAID TO HIS WIFE HERE MISSIS TAKE THIS YOUNG WOMAN INTO THE PARLOUR
YOU'RE A RARE UN FOR SITTING DOWN TO YOUR WORK A LITTLE WHILE AFTER IT'S TIME TO PUT BY MUNNY MY IRON'S TWITE TOLD
THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE AND HE SAID LOUDLY AND SHARPLY FOR WHAT FOR A GREAT CRIME--THE MURDER OF HER CHILD IT CAN'T BE ADAM ALMOST SHOUTED STARTING UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND MAKING A STRIDE TOWARDS THE DOOR
THE SLEEVE ROLLED UP ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOWED AN ARM THAT WAS LIKELY TO WIN THE PRIZE FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH
YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME
THE MOTHER AND SONS LISTENED EACH WITH PECULIAR FEELINGS
AS IT WAS SHE STARTED WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE END OF THE SIDE-ALLEY AND LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT DROPS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS
AND IF SHE AND HETTY HAPPENED TO BE OUT ADAM COULD LEARN WHERE THEY WERE GONE OR WHEN THEY WOULD BE AT HOME AGAIN
AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES I WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN
AND YET BEFORE THE CRUEL LETTER ARTHUR HAD BEEN SO TENDER AND LOVING
SHE LONGED FOR IT
IT WAS AT A THATCHED COTTAGE OUTSIDE THE TOWN A LITTLE WAY FROM THE MILL--AN OLD COTTAGE STANDING SIDEWAYS TOWARDS THE ROAD WITH A LITTLE BIT OF POTATO-GROUND BEFORE IT
THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO MAR MARTIN POYSER'S PLEASURE IN THIS DANCE
THIS STATE OF THINGS IS NATURALLY EMBITTERING
AND HE JUSTIFIED IT BY OBSERVING THAT WHAT A SCHOOLMASTER WANTED WAS BRAINS AND OAT-CAKE RAN TOO MUCH TO BONE INSTEAD OF BRAINS
BUT YOU THINK ALL YOU NEED DO TO LEARN ACCOUNTS IS TO COME TO ME AND DO SUMS FOR AN HOUR OR SO TWO OR THREE TIMES A-WEEK
YOU'LL BE SURE AN COME NOW AT SEVEN
THE WHITE MIST LAY IN THE VALLEY
SHE BROUGHT ME UP FOR I WAS AN ORPHAN
EVERYBODY COULD SAY COME TIM EXCEPT ALICK WHO NEVER RELAXED INTO THE FRIVOLITY OF UNNECESSARY SPEECH
AND THE LIGHT MUSIC OF THE DROPPING WHEY IS IN MY EARS MINGLING WITH THE TWITTERING OF A BIRD OUTSIDE THE WIRE NETWORK WINDOW--THE WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE GARDEN AND SHADED BY TALL GUELDER ROSES
OR WILL YOU SIT DOWN A BIT LONGER ON MY COAT HERE AND I'LL PROP Y UP
THEY WERE BUT COLOURED GLASS AND GILDING BUT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE MADE OF THEY LOOKED JUST AS WELL AS WHAT THE LADIES WORE
WHAT DO YOU THINK MY WENCH O GOING TO SEE HER AS SOON AS YOU CAN BE SPARED AND PERSUADING HER TO COME BACK WI YOU
AND FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE SAT HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE OLD MAP OF ENGLAND THAT HUNG AGAINST THE OPPOSITE WALL FOR AGE HAD TURNED IT OF A FINE YELLOW BROWN SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF A WELL-SEASONED MEERSCHAUM
IT WAS NEARLY DARK IN THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE TREES BUT WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF FIR-TREES ROUND THE HERMITAGE THERE WAS ROOM FOR THE GROWING MOONLIGHT TO ENTER IN AT THE WINDOWS
LOOKING ON THE WHOLE LIKE AN ACTOR WHO HAS ONLY A MONO-SYLLABIC PART ENTRUSTED TO HIM BUT FEELS SURE THAT THE AUDIENCE DISCERN HIS FITNESS FOR THE LEADING BUSINESS
IN A MOMENT HIS RIGHT HAND WAS CLENCHED AND DEALT A BLOW LIKE LIGHTNING WHICH SENT ADAM STAGGERING BACKWARD
DOST THINK NOTHING UD TURN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING PECULIAR IN HIS BROTHER'S TONE WHICH MADE SETH STEAL A GLANCE AT HIS FACE BEFORE HE ANSWERED
SIT DOWN MY DEAR AN LOOK AS IF YOU KNOWED WHAT IT WAS TO MAKE YOURSELF A BIT COMFORTABLE I THE WORLD
YOU'VE GOT AN IRON WILL AS WELL AS AN IRON ARM
AND THEN IN THE VERY NEXT FIELD SHE THOUGHT SHE REMEMBERED THERE WAS A HOVEL OF FURZE NEAR A SHEEPFOLD
I'VE SEEN PRETTY CLEAR EVER SINCE I COULD CAST UP A SUM AS YOU CAN NEVER DO WHAT'S WRONG WITHOUT BREEDING SIN AND TROUBLE MORE THAN YOU CAN EVER SEE
MY WORK AND MY JOY ARE HERE AMONG THE HILLS AND I SOMETIMES THINK I CLING TOO MUCH TO MY LIFE AMONG THE PEOPLE HERE AND SHOULD BE REBELLIOUS IF I WAS CALLED AWAY
HE'D MORE NEED TO LEARN AN LAY BY SIXPENCE
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING A FARM-HOUSE IS TO BE SURE AN I SAY YES
SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY GET A SIGHT ON'T TOO BUT THEY'RE MOSTLY FOLKS WHOSE EYES ARE NOT MUCH USE TO EM AT ANYTHING ELSE
AND SEE YE DO NOT SPILL FOR IF YE DO YE SHALL DRINK TWO FOR TIS OUR MASTER'S WILL
HIS GRANDMOTHER WAS NAMED CHARLOTTE
HE STOOD STILL IN THE DIM LIGHT WAITING FOR ARTHUR TO RISE
HE HELD HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND SCREWED UP HIS MOUTH AS HE NUDGED BARTLE MASSEY AND WATCHED HALF-WITTED TOM THOLER OTHERWISE KNOWN AS TOM SAFT RECEIVING HIS SECOND PLATEFUL OF BEEF
I SAID NOUGHT ABOUT THE WOMEN PREACHIN I SAID YOU LET THE BIBLE ALONE
THE GRANARY-DOOR WAS GROANING ON ITS HINGES AS ALICK SHUT IT AFTER DEALING OUT THE CORN
OUR EMOTION IN ITS KEENEST MOMENT PASSES FROM EXPRESSION INTO SILENCE OUR LOVE AT ITS HIGHEST FLOOD RUSHES BEYOND ITS OBJECT AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE SENSE OF DIVINE MYSTERY
I SHALL TAKE A STEP FARTHER SAID ADAM AND GO ON TO SEE MESTER MASSEY FOR HE WASN'T AT CHURCH YESTERDAY AND I'VE NOT SEEN HIM FOR A WEEK PAST
BUT ADAM THOUGHT THAT HE AND SETH MIGHT CARRY ON A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IN ADDITION TO THEIR JOURNEYMAN'S WORK BY BUYING A SMALL STOCK OF SUPERIOR WOOD AND MAKING ARTICLES OF HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE FOR WHICH ADAM HAD NO END OF CONTRIVANCES
AND WHAT HE CAME DOWN FOR WAS TO TELL GOOD NEWS ABOUT GOD TO THE POOR
WHO CAN BE CHEERED AND HELPED ONWARD BY YOUR FELLOW-FEELING YOUR FORBEARANCE YOUR OUTSPOKEN BRAVE JUSTICE
BY TH SAME TOKEN MY WIFE'S BEEN A-PLAGUIN ON ME TO BUILD HER A OVEN THIS TWELVEMONT THERE'S REASON IN WHAT THEE SAY'ST ADAM OBSERVED SETH GRAVELY
THE WOODS BEHIND THE CHASE AND ALL THE HEDGEROW TREES TOOK ON A SOLEMN SPLENDOUR UNDER THE DARK LOW-HANGING SKIES
AND BESIDES THAT I THINK I SHOULD GIVE OFFENCE TO ADAM BY SPEAKING TO HIM AT ALL ABOUT MARRYING
BUT I NIVER MEANT YOU TO GO TO SERVICE MY WENCH
I SHOULD BE AS THANKFUL T HAVE HER FOR A SISTER AS THEE WOULDST T HAVE HER FOR A DAUGHTER
HAVE YOU BECOME AN AMATEUR OF DAMP QUARRIES AND SKIMMING DISHES ARTHUR KNEW THE RECTOR TOO WELL TO SUPPOSE THAT A CLEVER INVENTION WOULD BE OF ANY USE SO HE SAID WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED FRANKNESS NO I WENT TO LOOK AT THE PRETTY BUTTER-MAKER HETTY SORREL
PUT YOUR FACE TO ONE OF THE GLASS PANES IN THE RIGHT-HAND WINDOW
SO NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER AND MORE NATURAL
BUT IF ANYBODY ASKS ANY QUESTIONS UPSTAIRS JUST YOU TAKE NO NOTICE AND TURN THE TALK TO SOMETHING ELSE AND I'LL BE OBLIGED TO YOU
BUT THEY MAY WAIT O'ER LONG TO BE SURE SAID MRS POYSER
NOT ADAM
DINAH SEEMED ALMOST TO HAVE FORGOTTEN SETH'S PRESENCE AND HER PACE WAS BECOMING SO MUCH QUICKER THAT THE SENSE OF THEIR BEING ONLY A FEW MINUTES WALK FROM THE YARD-GATES OF THE HALL FARM AT LAST GAVE SETH COURAGE TO SPEAK
SHE SAYS I'LL NEVER RISK A SINGLE PROPHECY ON ARTHUR UNTIL I SEE THE WOMAN HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH SHE THINKS YOUR LADY-LOVE WILL RULE YOU AS THE MOON RULES THE TIDES
I TELL YOU A WOMAN ULL BAKE YOU A PIE EVERY WEEK OF HER LIFE AND NEVER COME TO SEE THAT THE HOTTER TH OVEN THE SHORTER THE TIME
HE'S NOT THE SAME MAN TO ME AND I CAN'T FEEL THE SAME TOWARDS HIM
AND IF THEE GET'ST RESPECT THEE'ST WON IT BY THY OWN DESERTS
THAT BLOW OF YOURS MUST HAVE COME AGAINST ME LIKE A BATTERING-RAM
HAVEN'T I GOT ENOUGH TO VEX ME WITHOUT THAT
I'M FOR DOING NOUGHT BUT WHAT'S A MAN'S DUTY THE THOUGHT THAT IF HE BETRAYED HIS TROUBLE TO HIS MOTHER SHE WOULD ONLY DISTRESS HIM BY WORDS HALF OF BLUNDERING AFFECTION HALF OF IRREPRESSIBLE TRIUMPH THAT HETTY PROVED AS UNFIT TO BE HIS WIFE AS SHE HAD ALWAYS FORESEEN BROUGHT BACK SOME OF HIS HABITUAL FIRMNESS AND SELF-COMMAND
BUT THEY STARTED ASUNDER WITH BEATING HEARTS
I SHALL BE EASIER IF THEE'T I BED NAY I'LL BIDE TILL SETH COMES
WHEN HETTY RECOVERED FROM HER BURST OF WEEPING SHE RALLIED HER FAINTING COURAGE
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL WHAT SPIRIT SHE SHOWED
THAT'S BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND GOD AS HE'S SAID TO ME MANY A TIME AYE AYE
THE BROOK'S FINE AND FULL NOW
IT WAS NECESSARY TO ARTHUR YOU PERCEIVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
THE RUNNIN BROOK ISNA ATHIRST FOR TH RAIN
MRS POYSER CURTSIED AND THANKED HIM WITH GREAT SELF-COMMAND BUT WHEN HE HAD PASSED ON SHE WHISPERED TO HER HUSBAND I'LL LAY MY LIFE HE'S BREWIN SOME NASTY TURN AGAINST US
AND NOTHING COULD BE PLAINER OR LESS NOTICEABLE THAN HER CAP AND GOWN FOR THERE WAS NO WEAKNESS OF WHICH SHE WAS LESS TOLERANT THAN FEMININE VANITY AND THE PREFERENCE OF ORNAMENT TO UTILITY
I'M NO FRIEND TO YOUNG FELLOWS A-MARRYING AFORE THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ATWEEN A CRAB AN A APPLE
BUT WHEN THEY CAME TO THE FIELDS HE SAID TO THE BOYS NOW THEN WHICH IS THE STOUTEST WALKER
PRODUCED BY AN ANONYMOUS VOLUNTEER AND DAVID WIDGER ADAM BEDE BY GEORGE ELIOT BOOK ONE CHAPTER I THE WORKSHOP WITH A SINGLE DROP OF INK FOR A MIRROR THE EGYPTIAN SORCERER UNDERTAKES TO REVEAL TO ANY CHANCE COMER FAR-REACHING VISIONS OF THE PAST
FOR SHE MUST LOOK AS IF SHE'D COME STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN LIKE TH ANGELS IN THE DESERT TO STRENGTHEN THEM AS HA GOT NOTHING T EAT AND WHEN AT LAST HE CAME IN SIGHT OF SNOWFIELD HE THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A TOWN THAT WAS FELLOW TO THE COUNTRY THOUGH THE STREAM THROUGH THE VALLEY WHERE THE GREAT MILL STOOD GAVE A PLEASANT GREENNESS TO THE LOWER FIELDS
BUT HE FELT NO SHYNESS ABOUT SPEAKING NOT BEING TROUBLED WITH SMALL VANITY OR LACK OF WORDS
BUT A MAN HAS OTHER FEELINGS BESIDES WHAT HE OWES TO'S FATHER AND MOTHER AND THEE OUGHTNA TO WANT TO RULE OVER ME BODY AND SOUL
TO BE FULL OF LOVE TO EVERY CREATURE
IN FRONT OF SANDY JIM STOOD CHAD'S BESS WHO HAD SHOWN AN UNWONTED QUIETUDE AND FIXITY OF ATTENTION EVER SINCE DINAH HAD BEGUN TO SPEAK
AND SHE'S AS WHITE AS A SHEET
SHE HAD QUITE LOST HER WAY IN THE FIELDS AND MIGHT AS WELL GO IN ONE DIRECTION AS ANOTHER FOR AUGHT SHE KNEW
THE TURNKEY LOOKED ASKANCE AT HER ALL THE WHILE BUT NEVER SPOKE
IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD MADE A SERIOUS AFFAIR OF AN IDLE MATTER BY THINKING OF IT AS IF IT WERE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
WHEN SUNDAY BOOKS HAD MOST OF THEM OLD BROWN-LEATHER COVERS AND OPENED WITH REMARKABLE PRECISION ALWAYS IN ONE PLACE
MY FAMILY'S ATE THEIR OWN BREAD AND CHEESE AS FUR BACK AS ANYBODY KNOWS HANNA THEY FATHER
I SAID YOU WISHED TO SEE HER BEFORE THE TRIAL IF SHE CONSENTED AS MR IRWINE PAUSED ADAM LOOKED AT HIM WITH EAGER QUESTIONING EYES
IT'S FINE TALKING O WHAT YOU DID AT MR OTTLEY'S
HOW HETTY'S HEART BEAT AS ARTHUR APPROACHED HER
BESIDES HE IS NO LONGER IN IRELAND
AND THIS LAST THOUGHT HELPED HIM TO ARRIVE AT A CONCLUSION
WHY ADAM LAD IS'T YOU
ON THE OTHER HAND POYSER YOU MIGHT LET THURLE HAVE THE LOWER AND UPPER RIDGES WHICH REALLY WITH OUR WET SEASONS WOULD BE A GOOD RIDDANCE FOR YOU
YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE ADAM READING HIS BIBLE
FOR THEIR SOULS ARE ENLARGED FOR EVERMORE BY THAT UNION AND THEY BEAR ONE ANOTHER ABOUT IN THEIR THOUGHTS CONTINUALLY AS IT WERE A NEW STRENGTH.--YOUR FAITHFUL SISTER AND FELLOW-WORKER IN CHRIST DINAH MORRIS I HAVE NOT SKILL TO WRITE THE WORDS SO SMALL AS YOU DO AND MY PEN MOVES SLOW
AND AS MOLLY NOW ENTERED WITH THE DOCK-LEAVES SHE TOOK THEM SILENTLY AND RETURNED TO THE DAIRY WITHOUT ASKING FURTHER QUESTIONS
FOR WITH ARTHUR'S SENSITIVENESS TO OPINION THE LOSS OF ADAM'S RESPECT WAS A SHOCK TO HIS SELF-CONTENTMENT WHICH SUFFUSED HIS IMAGINATION WITH THE SENSE THAT HE HAD SUNK IN ALL EYES--AS A SUDDEN SHOCK OF FEAR FROM SOME REAL PERIL MAKES A NERVOUS WOMAN AFRAID EVEN TO STEP BECAUSE ALL HER PERCEPTIONS ARE SUFFUSED WITH A SENSE OF DANGER
HERE DINAH LODGED WITH AN ELDERLY COUPLE
ACROSS THIS BROOK A PLANK IS THROWN AND OVER THIS PLANK ADAM BEDE IS PASSING WITH HIS UNDOUBTING STEP FOLLOWED CLOSE BY GYP WITH THE BASKET
FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MRS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY THERE IS TOO MUCH DAIRY LAND AND TOO LITTLE PLOUGH LAND ON THE CHASE FARM TO SUIT THURLE'S PURPOSE--INDEED HE WILL ONLY TAKE THE FARM ON CONDITION OF SOME CHANGE IN IT
AND THEN SHE TALKS O THE WEATHER BEIN I FAULT AS THERE'S FOLKS UD STAND ON THEIR HEADS AND THEN SAY THE FAULT WAS I THEIR BOOTS WELL CHOWNE'S BEEN WANTING TO BUY SALLY SO WE CAN GET RID OF HER IF THEE LIK'ST SAID MR POYSER SECRETLY PROUD OF HIS WIFE'S SUPERIOR POWER OF PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
BUT ADAM'S SWIFT PACE COULD NOT STILL THE EAGER PAIN OF THINKING--OF LIVING AGAIN WITH CONCENTRATED SUFFERING THROUGH THE LAST WRETCHED HOUR AND LOOKING OUT FROM IT OVER ALL THE NEW SAD FUTURE
NEMESIS CAN SELDOM FORGE A SWORD FOR HERSELF OUT OF OUR CONSCIENCES--OUT OF THE SUFFERING WE FEEL IN THE SUFFERING WE MAY HAVE CAUSED
I'VE NOT TURNED A DEAF EAR TO YOUR WORDS SETH FOR WHEN I SAW AS YOUR LOVE WAS GIVEN TO ME I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LEADING OF PROVIDENCE FOR ME TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE AND THAT WE SHOULD BE FELLOW-HELPERS
IF HE DID NOT MIND ABOUT HER AS HE USED TO DO HE HAD PROMISED TO BE GOOD TO HER
WHAT SAID BARTLE WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST
AND HE SHALL KNOW IT...HE SHALL FEEL IT...IF THERE'S A JUST GOD HE SHALL FEEL WHAT IT IS T HA BROUGHT A CHILD LIKE HER TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MR IRWINE
THE DECISIVE MOMENT WAS NOT FAR OFF ADAM FELT A SHUDDERING HORROR THAT WOULD NOT LET HIM LOOK AT HETTY BUT SHE HAD LONG RELAPSED INTO HER BLANK HARD INDIFFERENCE
WE SHALL HATE AND DESPISE WITH THAT TRUE RUMINANT RELISH WHICH BELONGS TO UNDOUBTING CONFIDENCE BUT MY GOOD FRIEND WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN WITH YOUR FELLOW-PARISHIONER WHO OPPOSES YOUR HUSBAND IN THE VESTRY
THERE'S NOBODY CAN TAKE CARE O HETTY IN THIS THING BUT ME I CAN DO WHAT I THINK NEEDFUL IN THE MATTER SAID ARTHUR MORE AND MORE IRRITATED BY MINGLED DISTRESS AND PERPLEXITY WITHOUT GIVING PROMISES TO YOU
WHY BURGE IS THE MAN TO BUY TIMBER
ARTHUR FELT HIS TEMPER RISING
SHE SAID MY NAME IS SARAH STONE
THE CHOIR HAD TWO NARROW PEWS TO THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIGHT-HAND ROW SO THAT IT WAS A SHORT PROCESS FOR JOSHUA RANN TO TAKE HIS PLACE AMONG THEM AS PRINCIPAL BASS AND RETURN TO HIS DESK AFTER THE SINGING WAS OVER
DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MRS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE
HE ROSE TOOK DOWN HIS HAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE FIELDS
BUT ONCE BY THE SIDE OF HER OWN BED SHE THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES AND POURED OUT IN DEEP SILENCE ALL THE PASSIONATE PITY THAT FILLED HER HEART
BUT DINAH DOESN'T HOLD WI THEM AS ARE FOR KEEPING THE SOCIETY SO STRICT TO THEMSELVES
BUT WHEN SLEEP AND REST HAD BROUGHT BACK THE STRENGTH NECESSARY FOR THE KEENNESS OF MENTAL SUFFERING--WHEN SHE LAY THE NEXT MORNING LOOKING AT THE GROWING LIGHT WHICH WAS LIKE A CRUEL TASK-MASTER RETURNING TO URGE FROM HER A FRESH ROUND OF HATED HOPELESS LABOUR--SHE BEGAN TO THINK WHAT COURSE SHE MUST TAKE TO REMEMBER THAT ALL HER MONEY WAS GONE TO LOOK AT THE PROSPECT OF FURTHER WANDERING AMONG STRANGERS WITH THE NEW CLEARNESS SHED ON IT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER JOURNEY TO WINDSOR
HADNA SHE THE CUMBER O REARIN THEE AN DOIN FOR THEE ALL THESE EARS WELL GOOD-BYE THEN MOTHER--GOOD-BYE LAD--REMEMBER GYP WHEN YOU GET HOME SAID ADAM TURNING AWAY TOWARDS THE GATE OF THE PLEASURE-GROUNDS WHERE HE HOPED HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO JOIN THE POYSERS FOR HE HAD BEEN SO OCCUPIED THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON THAT HE HAD HAD NO TIME TO SPEAK TO HETTY
ADAM WAS LOST IN THE UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY OF FINDING ANY PERSON FOR HIS FEARS TO ALIGHT ON
IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ WHILE HE IS REALLY LOOKING OVER HIS SPECTACLES AT ADAM BEDE SEATED NEAR THE DARK WINDOW
SOMETHING HAD FALLEN ON THE GROUND WITH A RATTLING NOISE
THAT'S WHAT I SAYS TO MILLS THIS MORNING
SHE NEVER MEANT TO CAUSE HIM THIS DREADFUL PAIN
SHE'S MORE NOR EVERYTHING ELSE TO ME ALL BUT MY CONSCIENCE AND MY GOOD NAME
WHAT DOST THINK O THAT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE
AND AS SOON AS HE HAD BEEN HOME AND DONE WHAT WAS NECESSARY THERE TO PREPARE FOR HIS FURTHER ABSENCE HE WOULD START OFF TO IRELAND
AFTER ALL ADAM WAS THE BEST PERSON WHO COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AND HETTY TOGETHER--HE WAS A SENSIBLE FELLOW AND WOULD NOT BABBLE ABOUT IT TO OTHER PEOPLE
HETTY LOOKED UP AT HIM SMILINGLY AND PUT HER ROUND ARM THROUGH HIS IN A MOMENT
MARTIN THOUGH USUALLY BLEST WITH A GOOD APPETITE REALLY FORGOT TO FINISH HIS OWN BEEF TO-NIGHT--IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO HIM TO LOOK ON IN THE INTERVALS OF CARVING AND SEE HOW THE OTHERS ENJOYED THEIR SUPPER
BUT NEARER MEMORIES WOULD NOT BE THRUST AWAY
THEY WERE ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN BUSHY MASSES NOW FLAUNTING WITH WIDE-OPEN PETALS ALMOST ALL OF THEM OF THE STREAKED PINK-AND-WHITE KIND WHICH DOUBTLESS DATED FROM THE UNION OF THE HOUSES OF YORK AND LANCASTER
ON A CUSHION A LITTLE REMOVED SAT PUG WITH THE AIR OF A MAIDEN LADY WHO LOOKED ON THESE FAMILIARITIES AS ANIMAL WEAKNESSES WHICH SHE MADE AS LITTLE SHOW AS POSSIBLE OF OBSERVING
FOR THIS LAST VIEW OF THE MATTER MUST BE THE TRUE ONE
I'D HA BEEN WILLIN T HA HER ABOUT ME TILL I DIED AND WENT TO LIE BY MY OLD MAN
BUT NOW SHE APPEARED HOLDING HER MOTHER'S HAND--THE END OF HER ROUND NOSE RATHER SHINY FROM A RECENT AND HURRIED APPLICATION OF SOAP AND WATER
I'M SURE YOU HAVE HAD HARD WORK TO WIN THEM THIS WARM DAY BESSY'S LIP FELL AS SHE SAW THE UGLY HEAVY GOWN--WHICH FELT SO HOT AND DISAGREEABLE TOO ON THIS JULY DAY AND WAS SUCH A GREAT UGLY THING TO CARRY
BUT HE HAS NOT YET OPENED HIS LIPS EXCEPT TO SAY IN A RESOUNDING BASS UNDERTONE LIKE THE TUNING OF A VIOLONCELLO SEHON KING OF THE AMORITES
BUT IF WE HEARD NOTHING FROM HER AFTER TWO MONTHS WE MIGHT DO AS WE LIKED WITH EM I WILL NOT SAY THAT IN THIS ACCOMMODATING PROPOSITION THE LANDLADY HAD NO REGARD WHATEVER TO THE POSSIBLE REWARD OF HER GOOD NATURE IN THE ULTIMATE POSSESSION OF THE LOCKET AND EAR-RINGS
BUT I THINK THE HIGHER NATURE HAS TO LEARN THIS COMPREHENSION AS WE LEARN THE ART OF VISION BY A GOOD DEAL OF HARD EXPERIENCE OFTEN WITH BRUISES AND GASHES INCURRED IN TAKING THINGS UP BY THE WRONG END AND FANCYING OUR SPACE WIDER THAN IT IS
I THOUGHT I COULD TELL YOU
THINK OF THAT NOW
THEE LOOK'DST AS SCARED AS SCARED IT LITTLE SINNIFIES HOW I LOOKED SAID MRS POYSER
HIS SOFT VOICE WAS SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THOSE PRETTY THINGS SHE HAD HEARD IN THE WOOD
BUT IT'S NOTHING OF A DAY'S JOURNEY FOR ANYBODY AS HAS GOT A FIRST-RATE NAG
THAT'S RIGHT ARTHUR SAID
SUSCEPTIBLE PERSONS ARE MORE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF TONE THAN BY UNEXPECTED WORDS AND ARTHUR HAD THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF A NATURE AT ONCE AFFECTIONATE AND VAIN
HE HIMSELF WAS VERY MUCH TOUCHED ON SEEING THEM ALL AGAIN AND FEELING THAT HE WAS IN A NEW RELATION TO THEM
YOU WON'T SEE HER AGAIN ADAM EXCLAIMED WITH A FLASH OF RECURRING ANGER AND SUSPICION MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR AND PLACING HIS BACK AGAINST IT
HIM AND TH OLD SQUIRE FIT ONE ANOTHER LIKE FROST AND FLOWERS MR CRAIG SMILED AND WINKED SLOWLY AS HE MADE THIS LAST OBSERVATION BUT THE SUBJECT WAS NOT DEVELOPED FARTHER FOR NOW THEY HAD REACHED THE TURNING IN THE ROAD WHERE ADAM AND HIS COMPANIONS MUST SAY GOOD-BYE THE GARDENER TOO WOULD HAVE HAD TO TURN OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION IF HE HAD NOT ACCEPTED MR POYSER'S INVITATION TO TEA
HE SAW AS PLAINLY AS POSSIBLE HOW ILL THE WOODS ON THE ESTATE WERE MANAGED AND THE SHAMEFUL STATE OF THE FARM-BUILDINGS
BUT DIVINING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE GOT BY STAYING SHE JUMPED OFF THE SHELF AND RAN AWAY TO JINGLE HER POCKET IN THE HEARING OF NANCY WHILE HER MOTHER CALLED AFTER HER OH FOR SHAME YOU NAUGHTY GELL
STILL THE SYMPATHY OF THE COURT WAS NOT WITH THE PRISONER
AND I'D DONE IT IN A MINUTE
AFTER THIS YOU WILL PERHAPS BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT ALTHOUGH GAWAINE WAS AT HOME THE HAND OF THE DIAL IN THE COURTYARD HAD SCARCELY CLEARED THE LAST STROKE OF THREE WHEN ARTHUR RETURNED THROUGH THE ENTRANCE-GATES GOT DOWN FROM THE PANTING RATTLER AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE TO TAKE A HASTY LUNCHEON
AND REFUSING TO ACCEPT REASONS WHICH SEEMED TO HER NOTHING BUT WHIM AND CONTRAIRINESS
I'VE STOOD ENOUGH OF EM POOR LISBETH DID NOT HEAR THIS THREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IF SHE HAD BEEN WISE SHE WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY QUIETLY AND SAID NOTHING FOR THE NEXT HOUR
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT DAVID DID WHEN GOD TOOK AWAY HIS CHILD FROM HIM
COME BEN LAD SAID SETH IN A PERSUASIVE TONE DON'T LET'S HAVE A QUARREL ABOUT IT
DINAH HAD TAKEN OFF HER LITTLE QUAKER BONNET AGAIN AND WAS HOLDING IT IN HER HANDS THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE A FREER ENJOYMENT OF THE COOL EVENING TWILIGHT AND SETH COULD SEE THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE QUITE CLEARLY AS HE WALKED BY HER SIDE TIMIDLY REVOLVING SOMETHING HE WANTED TO SAY TO HER
THEE'T HELP ME TO CARRY IT TO BROX'ON WHEN IT'S DONE
I'VE BEEN MUCH DRAWN OUT IN PRAYER FOR HER OF LATE AND I LOOK ON IT AS A TOKEN THAT THERE MAY BE MERCY IN STORE FOR HER GOD GRANT IT SAID SETH
HIS SURPRISE WAS GREAT WHEN HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ADAM BUT HE WAS NOT A MAN GIVEN TO PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL
SO THROUGH THE REST OF THE WALK HE CLAIMED ADAM'S CONVERSATION FOR HIMSELF AND HETTY LAID HER SMALL PLOTS AND IMAGINED HER LITTLE SCENES OF CUNNING BLANDISHMENT AS SHE WALKED ALONG BY THE HEDGEROWS ON HONEST ADAM'S ARM QUITE AS WELL AS IF SHE HAD BEEN AN ELEGANTLY CLAD COQUETTE ALONE IN HER BOUDOIR
THEREFORE LET ART ALWAYS REMIND US OF THEM
WHY LOR BLESS YOU MILLS SAYS I YOU SEE NO MORE INTO THIS THING NOR YOU CAN SEE INTO THE MIDDLE OF A POTATO
IN OTHER RESPECTS THERE IS LITTLE OUTWARD CHANGE NOW DISCERNIBLE IN OUR OLD FRIENDS OR IN THE PLEASANT HOUSE-PLACE BRIGHT WITH POLISHED OAK AND PEWTER
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE MET HETTY SORREL IN THIS GROVE AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE KISSED HER ARTHUR FELT A STARTLED UNCERTAINTY HOW FAR ADAM WAS SPEAKING FROM KNOWLEDGE AND HOW FAR FROM MERE INFERENCE
I ALLAYS SAID I'D NEVER MARRY A MAN AS HAD GOT NO BRAINS
BUT PERHAPS HETTY WAS ALREADY ASLEEP
NO MORE ROLLING WOODS NO MORE WIDE-BRANCHING TREES NEAR FREQUENT HOMESTEADS NO MORE BUSHY HEDGEROWS BUT GREYSTONE WALLS INTERSECTING THE MEAGRE PASTURES AND DISMAL WIDE-SCATTERED GREYSTONE HOUSES ON BROKEN LANDS WHERE MINES HAD BEEN AND WERE NO LONGER
THEE LOOK'ST AS IF THEE KNOW'DST NO MORE O CARE AN CUMBER NOR WHEN THEE WAST A BABBY A-LYIN AWAKE I TH CRADLE
HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF BY SEEING HETTY TO-DAY AND GET RID OF THE WHOLE THING FROM HIS MIND
WELL THEE MUSTNA FRET BEFOREHAND FATHER SAID MARTIN THE YOUNGER
BUT IF THEE MEAN'ST IT ABOUT MYSELF I'VE GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHTS AS SHE CAN EVER BE MY WIFE
THE KETTLE'S BOILING--WE'LL HAVE IT READY IN A MINUTE
BUT AT SEVEN HE RANG HIS BELL AND ASTONISHED PYM BY DECLARING HE WAS GOING TO GET UP AND MUST HAVE BREAKFAST BROUGHT TO HIM AT EIGHT
POOR SETH
YOU LOOK SO WHITE AND ILL YOUR AUNT MAY TAKE NOTICE OF IT HETTY HEARD THE WARNING
WELL MOVE ABOUT A BIT SHALL WE AND SEE WHAT ADAM BEDE'S DOING
SHE PAUSED IN THE MIDST OF HER LANGUID UNDRESSING AND LEANED AGAINST THE DARK OLD CLOTHES-PRESS
MANY MEN WOULD HAVE RETAINED A FEELING OF VINDICTIVENESS TOWARDS ADAM BUT HE WOULD NOT--HE WOULD RESOLUTELY OVERCOME ALL LITTLENESS OF THAT KIND FOR HE HAD CERTAINLY BEEN VERY MUCH IN THE WRONG
DEATH SEEMED STILL A LONG WAY OFF AND LIFE WAS SO STRONG IN HER
AYE AYE MUTTERED THE SCHOOLMASTER AS ADAM DISAPPEARED THERE YOU GO STALKING ALONG--STALKING ALONG
AND WHEN THE COURSE OF EVENTS SHALL PLACE THE ESTATE IN MY HANDS IT WILL BE MY FIRST DESIRE TO AFFORD MY TENANTS ALL THE ENCOURAGEMENT A LANDLORD CAN GIVE THEM IN IMPROVING THEIR LAND AND TRYING TO BRING ABOUT A BETTER PRACTICE OF HUSBANDRY
HE HAD HAD ENOUGH TO TIRE HIM AND THERE WAS NO MORE NEED FOR HIM TO THINK
I USED TO WISH I COULD DO IT IN MY PASSION--BUT THAT WAS WHEN I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T FEEL ENOUGH
I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO-DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MR IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION
HETTY'S SHRIEK MINGLED WITH THE SOUND AND THEY CLASPED EACH OTHER IN MUTUAL HORROR
I'VE BEEN READING YOUR FRIEND ARTHUR YOUNG'S BOOKS LATELY AND THERE'S NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN TO CARRY OUT SOME OF HIS IDEAS IN PUTTING THE FARMERS ON A BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THEIR LAND
PERHAPS YOU HAVE ONLY SEEN A BALLET RUSTIC SMILING LIKE A MERRY COUNTRYMAN IN CROCKERY WITH GRACEFUL TURNS OF THE HAUNCH AND INSINUATING MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD
THERE WAS SUCH A THORNY HEDGE OF HINDRANCES BETWEEN THEM AND AN IMPRUDENCE WOULD BE FATAL
AND I THINK HE'LL BE GLAD TO HEAR IT TOO WHAT'S THAT HETTY SAID INDIFFERENTLY
IT IS A TEMPTATION THAT I MUST RESIST LEST THE LOVE OF THE CREATURE SHOULD BECOME LIKE A MIST IN MY SOUL SHUTTING OUT THE HEAVENLY LIGHT IT PASSES MY CUNNING TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY EASE AND LUXURY SAID MRS POYSER AS SHE CUT THE BREAD AND BUTTER
I'M NONE O THEM MEN AS CAN GO MAKING LOVE FIRST TO ONE WOMAN AND THEN T ANOTHER AND DON'T THINK IT MUCH ODDS WHICH OF EM I TAKE
WILL MASKERY IS NO PREACHER HIMSELF I THINK NAY SIR HE'S NO GIFT AT STRINGIN THE WORDS TOGETHER WI'OUT BOOK
I DON'T BELIEVE GANYMEDE CRIED WHEN THE EAGLE CARRIED HIM AWAY AND PERHAPS DEPOSITED HIM ON JOVE'S SHOULDER AT THE END
THE GELLS ARE BOTH AT THE CHEESE AFTER THE ALE HAD BEEN DRAWN AND HER UNCLE'S PIPE LIGHTED THERE WAS TOTTY TO BE TAKEN TO BED AND BROUGHT DOWN AGAIN IN HER NIGHT-GOWN BECAUSE SHE WOULD CRY INSTEAD OF GOING TO SLEEP
EH IT'S FINE TALKIN O DANCIN SHE SAID AN THY FATHER NOT A FIVE WEEK IN'S GRAVE
I SAW IT FIRST LOOKING AFTER THE GREENFINCH AND SHE SAT ON TH NEST YOU DIDN'T FRIGHTEN HER I HOPE SAID THE MOTHER ELSE SHE'LL FORSAKE IT NO I WENT AWAY AS STILL AS STILL AND WHISPERED TO MOLLY--DIDN'T I MOLLY WELL WELL NOW COME ON SAID MRS POYSER AND WALK BEFORE FATHER AND MOTHER AND TAKE YOUR LITTLE SISTER BY THE HAND
YES ADAM
BUT ADAM OBJECTED TO TURNING HIS MOTHER OUT
JUST WHEN HE WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY FOR A WEEK OR TWO
I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T COME FROM ANY ANIMAL I KNEW BUT I WASN'T FOR STOPPING TO LOOK ABOUT JUST THEN
HUSH HUSH HUSH SAID MRS POYSER DID EVER ANYBODY HEAR SUCH NAUGHTY CHILDREN
BUT THIS PRESENCE OF DINAH IN HIS MIND ONLY HELPED HIM TO BEAR THE BETTER WITH HIS MOTHER'S MOOD WHICH HAD BEEN BECOMING MORE AND MORE QUERULOUS FOR THE LAST HOUR
WE CAN'T BE LIKE THE BIRDS AS FLY FROM THEIR NEST AS SOON AS THEY'VE GOT THEIR WINGS AND NEVER KNOW THEIR KIN WHEN THEY SEE EM AND GET A FRESH LOT EVERY YEAR
TROT ALONG QUICKLY WITH YOUR LITTLE FEET AND GET HOME SAFELY
AYE AYE I'M NEVER TO HAVE A WILL O MY OWN ANY MORE
HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
AND BECAUSE I KNOW IT I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT TOO
NOTHING NOISY AND BUSY BUT THE GAPING CURS OF MYSTERIOUS PEDIGREE
I'M GLAD YE'RE COME HETTY SAID MRS POYSER AS SHE LOOKED INTO THE BASKET OF CURRANTS TO SEE IF THE FRUIT WAS FINE RUN UPSTAIRS AND SEND MOLLY DOWN
YOU WOULD MISUNDERSTAND HER THOUGHTS DURING THESE WRETCHED DAYS IF YOU IMAGINED THAT THEY WERE INFLUENCED EITHER BY RELIGIOUS FEARS OR RELIGIOUS HOPES
IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT
COME HETTY GET TO BED SAID MR POYSER IN A SOOTHING TONE AS HE HIMSELF TURNED TO GO UPSTAIRS
THE JOCOSE TALK OF HAY-MAKERS IS BEST AT A DISTANCE
TOMMY WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO YOUR LITTLE SISTER'S DOLL
EVEN THE PRESENCE OF PYM WAITING ON HIM WITH THE USUAL DEFERENCE WAS A REASSURANCE TO HIM AFTER THE SCENES OF YESTERDAY
WELL SINCE I CAN'T GO TO EAGLEDALE I'LL HAVE A GALLOP ON RATTLER TO NORBURNE THIS MORNING AND LUNCH WITH GAWAINE BEHIND THIS EXPLICIT RESOLUTION THERE LAY AN IMPLICIT ONE
HEY HEY SAID MR POYSER WHILE HETTY STOOD WITHOUT MOVING NOT GO TO COUSIN HETTY
A MAN THAT'S GOT THE NAMES AND THE NATUR O PLANTS IN'S HEAD ISNA LIKELY TO KEEP A HOLLOW PLACE T HOLD TUNES IN
YOU FIND FAUT WI YOUR MEAT AN THE FAUT'S ALL I YOUR OWN STOMACH HETTY NOW CAME BACK FROM THE PANTRY AND SAID I CAN TAKE TOTTY NOW AUNT IF YOU LIKE COME RACHEL SAID MR POYSER AS HIS WIFE SEEMED TO HESITATE SEEING THAT TOTTY WAS AT LAST NESTLING QUIETLY THEE'DST BETTER LET HETTY CARRY HER UPSTAIRS WHILE THEE TAK'ST THY THINGS OFF
NOT AS HE'LL ATE MUCH PORRIDGE
BUT I'M IN HOPES THERE ARE BETTER TIMES COMING FOR YOU
FAINTER AND FAINTER AND MORE MUSICAL THROUGH THE GROWING DISTANCE THE FALLING DYING SOUND STILL REACHED HIM AS HE NEARED THE WILLOW BROOK
AND YET IF EVER A MAN HAD EXCUSES HE HAD
ADAM KNEW WHAT SUFFERING WAS--HE COULD NOT LAY A CRUEL FINGER ON A BRUISED MAN
PERHAPS THE WHOLE THING HAD BEEN CONTRIVED BY HIM AND HE HAD GIVEN HER DIRECTIONS HOW TO FOLLOW HIM TO IRELAND--FOR ADAM KNEW THAT ARTHUR HAD BEEN GONE THITHER THREE WEEKS AGO HAVING RECENTLY LEARNT IT AT THE CHASE
HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL-CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
IT'S LIKE WHEN A MAN'S SINGING A GOOD TUNE--YOU DON'T WANT T HEAR BELLS TINKLING AND INTERFERING WI THE SOUND HE TOOK HER ARM AND PUT IT WITHIN HIS AGAIN LOOKING DOWN ON HER FONDLY
I BELIEVE THE SECRET OF IT IS HE SAW FROM THE FIRST IT WOULD BE A PROFITABLE PLAN BUT HE HAD SOME PARTICULAR DISLIKE OF ADAM TO GET OVER--AND BESIDES THE FACT THAT I PROPOSE A THING IS GENERALLY A REASON WITH HIM FOR REJECTING IT
BUT THEN THERE WAS HER BASKET--SHE MUST HIDE THAT TOO
IT WAS FEAR MADE HER HIDE IT...I FORGIVE HER FOR DECEIVING ME...I FORGIVE THEE HETTY...THEE WAST DECEIVED TOO...IT'S GONE HARD WI THEE MY POOR HETTY...BUT THEY'LL NEVER MAKE ME BELIEVE IT HE WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HE SAID WITH FIERCE ABRUPTNESS I'LL GO TO HIM--I'LL BRING HIM BACK--I'LL MAKE HIM GO AND LOOK AT HER IN HER MISERY--HE SHALL LOOK AT HER TILL HE CAN'T FORGET IT--IT SHALL FOLLOW HIM NIGHT AND DAY--AS LONG AS HE LIVES IT SHALL FOLLOW HIM--HE SHAN'T ESCAPE WI LIES THIS TIME--I'LL FETCH HIM I'LL DRAG HIM MYSELF IN THE ACT OF GOING TOWARDS THE DOOR ADAM PAUSED AUTOMATICALLY AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR HIS HAT QUITE UNCONSCIOUS WHERE HE WAS OR WHO WAS PRESENT WITH HIM
SUCH IS THE BEAUTIFUL ARRANGEMENT OF THINGS
I'VE NEVER CARED ABOUT SINGING MYSELF
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T
THIS MORNING HE WAS READING THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MATTHEW AND LISBETH HAD BEEN STANDING CLOSE BY HIM FOR SOME MINUTES STROKING HIS HAIR WHICH WAS SMOOTHER THAN USUAL THIS MORNING AND LOOKING DOWN AT THE LARGE PAGE WITH SILENT WONDERMENT AT THE MYSTERY OF LETTERS
WHAT ART GOIN TO DO ADAM SAID THE MOTHER WITH A TONE AND LOOK OF ALARM
AND THE TIME WOULD BE SO LONG
BUT LET US LOVE THAT OTHER BEAUTY TOO WHICH LIES IN NO SECRET OF PROPORTION BUT IN THE SECRET OF DEEP HUMAN SYMPATHY
THERE WAS NOTHING BUT IMMEDIATE BEGGARY BEFORE HER
HE MIGHT COME TO BUILD A BRIDGE OR A TOWN HALL OR A FACTORY FOR HE HAD ALWAYS SAID TO HIMSELF THAT JONATHAN BURGE'S BUILDING BUSINESS WAS LIKE AN ACORN WHICH MIGHT BE THE MOTHER OF A GREAT TREE
THE CALM PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE HAD ONCE WAITED FOR HETTY'S LOVE CONTENT ONLY WITH HER PRESENCE AND THE THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE HAD FORSAKEN HIM SINCE THAT TERRIBLE SHOCK NEARLY THREE MONTHS AGO
ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
AND NOW IN HER DESPERATION AT THE NEARNESS OF THEIR MARRIAGE SHE HAD RUN AWAY
BUT IT WAS NOT THE BROOK OR THE WILLOWS NOT THE FIELDS OR THE SKY
I'M NO TENANT NOW
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LOVED HER BUT YOU'VE MADE HER LOVE YOU SAID ADAM
FOR YOU--AND YOU NEVER THINK OF HIM
BUT IF HE SHOULD GIVE THEM NOTICE AT LADY DAY ARTHUR AND I MUST MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO MOLLIFY HIM
IT ISN'T RIGHT FOR OLD NOR YOUNG NAYTHER TO MAKE A BARGAIN ALL O THEIR OWN SIDE
A PATRONISING DISPOSITION ALWAYS HAS ITS MEANER SIDE AND IN THE CONFUSION OF HIS IRRITATION AND ALARM THERE ENTERED THE FEELING THAT A MAN TO WHOM HE HAD SHOWN SO MUCH FAVOUR AS TO ADAM WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO CRITICIZE HIS CONDUCT
SHE HAD NO TEARS THIS MORNING
ADAM'S ATTACHMENT TO HER ADAM'S CARESS STIRRED NO PASSION IN HER WERE NO LONGER ENOUGH TO SATISFY HER VANITY BUT THEY WERE THE BEST HER LIFE OFFERED HER NOW--THEY PROMISED HER SOME CHANGE
I THINK YOURS IS THE PRETTIEST FARM ON THE ESTATE THOUGH
HER BODY WAS VERY WEARY TOO WITH THESE DAYS OF NEW FATIGUE AND ANXIETY
DINAH SAT DOWN AND HETTY BEGAN TO BRUSH TOGETHER HER HAIR BEFORE TWISTING IT UP DOING IT WITH THAT AIR OF EXCESSIVE INDIFFERENCE WHICH BELONGS TO CONFUSED SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT WHAT'S TH MATTER WI TH LAD
THEE KNOW'ST NOTHING AS GIVES THEE A RIGHT TO SAY THAT THEN I KNOWNA NOUGHT AS GI'ES ME A RIGHT TO SAY AS THE YEAR'S TURNED FOR ALL I FEEL IT FUST THING WHEN I GET UP I TH MORNING
AND HER AUNT ALLAYS SAYS HOW CLEVER SHE IS AT THE WORK
ADAM FOR HIS PART WAS GETTING VERY IMPATIENT TO SEE HER AND HE RESOLVED THAT IF SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE NEXT DAY SATURDAY HE WOULD SET OUT ON SUNDAY MORNING TO FETCH HER
AND THE GOOD-NATURED FATHER INDULGENT TO ALL WEAKNESSES BUT THOSE OF NEGLIGENT FARMERS SAID TO HETTY YOU'D BETTER TAKE THE THINGS OFF AGAIN MY LASS
BUT SINCE HE HAD ALWAYS WITH MARVELLOUS SKILL AVOIDED ANY QUARREL WITH MR DONNITHORNE HE COULD NOT ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF LAUGHING AT THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S DISCOMFITURE WITH ANY ONE BESIDES HIS MOTHER WHO DECLARED THAT IF SHE WERE RICH SHE SHOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MRS POYSER A PENSION FOR LIFE AND WANTED TO INVITE HER TO THE PARSONAGE THAT SHE MIGHT HEAR AN ACCOUNT OF THE SCENE FROM MRS POYSER'S OWN LIPS
NAY NAY SHUT THE BOOK SHE SAID
THEY HAD THE LIQUID LOOK WHICH TELLS THAT THE MIND IS FULL OF WHAT IT HAS TO GIVE OUT RATHER THAN IMPRESSED BY EXTERNAL OBJECTS
THEE'ST BEEN A-CRYIN IT'S ONLY A GRIEF THAT'LL PASS AWAY SAID DINAH WHO DID NOT WISH JUST NOW TO CALL FORTH LISBETH'S REMONSTRANCES BY DISCLOSING HER INTENTION TO LEAVE HAYSLOPE
WELL MESTER MASSEY SAID ADAM AS BARTLE CAME UP I'M GOING TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH YOU TO-DAY
SIT DOWN SIT DOWN BARTEL WENT INTO HIS LITTLE PANTRY AND BROUGHT OUT AN EXCELLENT HOME-BAKED LOAF
OUR MENTAL BUSINESS IS CARRIED ON MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE
WE HEAR A VOICE WITH THE VERY CADENCE OF OUR OWN UTTERING THE THOUGHTS WE DESPISE
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A NOISE IN THE SHOP NO LAD ADAM ANSWERED THERE'S NOTHING BUT WHAT I MUST DO MYSELF
SURELY HIS ATTENTIONS TO HETTY MUST HAVE BEEN OF A SLIGHT KIND
IF I HADNA MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO GO I SHOULD HA BEEN GONE BEFORE NOW HE HAD FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST NOW AND ROSE AS HE WAS SPEAKING
I WOULDN'T MISS YOUR MAIDEN SPEECH TO THE TENANTRY AND THERE WILL BE SOMETHING ELSE YOU'LL LIKE TO HEAR SAID ARTHUR
CHAPTER III AFTER THE PREACHING IN LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM THAT TIME SETH BEDE WAS WALKING BY DINAH'S SIDE ALONG THE HEDGEROW-PATH THAT SKIRTED THE PASTURES AND GREEN CORN-FIELDS WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE VILLAGE AND THE HALL FARM
AN WHAT'S IT SINNIFY HER BEIN A METHODY
IT'S ALLAYS BEEN EASIER FOR ME TO WORK NOR TO SIT STILL BUT THE REAL TOUGH JOB FOR ME UD BE TO MASTER MY OWN WILL AND TEMPER AND GO RIGHT AGAINST MY OWN PRIDE
HIS FIRST IMPULSE IF THERE HAD BEEN TIME FOR IT WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN TO UTTER WORDS OF PROPITIATION
WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY
BUT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF PLEADING BOYISH VEXATION IN HIS TONE AS HE SAID BUT PEOPLE MAY MAKE INJURIES WORSE BY UNREASONABLE CONDUCT--BY GIVING WAY TO ANGER AND SATISFYING THAT FOR THE MOMENT INSTEAD OF THINKING WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT IN THE FUTURE
AND MR CRAIG DETAINED HIM TO TELL HOW ALL THE SERVANTS WERE TO COLLECT AT THE GATE OF THE COURTYARD TO WISH THE YOUNG SQUIRE LUCK AS HE RODE OUT
TURNING ROUND TO TAKE A CHAIR CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SAID BUT DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT JOSHUA'S BUSINESS--HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY HUMBLY BEGGING YOUR HONOUR'S PARDON SAID JOSHUA BOWING LOW THERE WAS ONE THING I HAD TO SAY TO HIS REVERENCE AS OTHER THINGS HAD DROVE OUT O MY HEAD OUT WITH IT JOSHUA QUICKLY SAID MR IRWINE
SHE IS CONTRITE SHE HAS CONFESSED ALL TO ME
IT RECALLED TO HER THE NECESSITY OF RALLYING HER NATIVE POWERS OF CONCEALMENT WHICH HAD HALF GIVEN WAY UNDER THE SHOCK OF ADAM'S WORDS
I OUGHT TO HAVE RESISTED MY FEELINGS
GOOD-BYE HE TOOK HER HAND AND LOOKED AT HER HALF-SADLY HALF WITH A CONSTRAINED SMILE
WHAT GREATER THING IS THERE FOR TWO HUMAN SOULS THAN TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE JOINED FOR LIFE--TO STRENGTHEN EACH OTHER IN ALL LABOUR TO REST ON EACH OTHER IN ALL SORROW TO MINISTER TO EACH OTHER IN ALL PAIN TO BE ONE WITH EACH OTHER IN SILENT UNSPEAKABLE MEMORIES AT THE MOMENT OF THE LAST PARTING
SETH TRIED NOT TO LET DINAH SEE THAT HE HAD NOTICED HER FACE AND ONLY SAID I'M THANKFUL YOU'RE COME DINAH FOR MOTHER'S BEEN HUNGERING AFTER THE SIGHT OF YOU ALL DAY
THERE WAS NO BLUSH NO TREMULOUSNESS WHICH SAID I KNOW YOU THINK ME A PRETTY WOMAN TOO YOUNG TO PREACH
NO NOT YET
HE SET THE CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE OTTOMAN AGAIN EXHAUSTED WITH THE EFFORT
I THINK THESE AS ARE ALL PINK AND HAVE GOT A FINER SORT O GREEN LEAVES ARE PRETTIER THAN THE STRIPED UNS DON'T YOU HE SET DOWN THE BASKET AND TOOK THE ROSE FROM HIS BUTTON-HOLE
HE CARRIED A HARD BUSINESS WELL THROUGH AND DIED WHEN OTHER FOLKS WERE GOING TO REAP THE FRUITS
AND THE STRAY HORSES ON THE GREEN SIDES OF THE LANES AND ON THE COMMON HAD THEIR MANES BLOWN ABOUT THEIR FACES
SO THE WORLD GOES ROUND
SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE WORN IT IF SHE HAD DARED TO ENCOUNTER HER AUNT'S QUESTIONS ABOUT A RIBBON ROUND HER NECK
AND THEN HOW MUCH TEN WORKMEN WOULD GET WORKING THREE OR TWENTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS AT THAT RATE--AND ALL THE WHILE HIS NEEDLE WOULD BE GOING JUST AS FAST AS IF HE LEFT HIS HEAD EMPTY FOR THE DEVIL TO DANCE IN
IT'S RIGHT THEY SHOULD KNOW IT WAS A FINE GENTLEMAN MADE LOVE TO HER AND TURNED HER HEAD WI NOTIONS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ADAM NOT TO FEEL THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE LAST WEEK HAD BROUGHT THE PROSPECT OF MARRIAGE NEARER TO HIM
THEY WERE MERELY HYSTERICAL TEARS
OTHER FOLKS WON'T BELIEVE AS YOU'VE MEANT NOTHING
WHEN THEY'VE GOT TO GET UP AT HALF AFTER FOUR AND THE MOWERS BOTTLES TO FILL AND THE BAKING
AN THEE SHA'T PUT ON THY SUNDAY CLOOSE WHEN THEE LIK'ST FOR ME--I'LL NE'ER PLAGUE THEE NO MOOR ABOUT'N WELL WELL
AND ON SUNDAY MORNING WHEN SETH WENT AWAY TO CHAPEL AT TREDDLESTON THE DANGEROUS OPPORTUNITY CAME
FOR HETTY LOOKED OUT FROM HER SECRET MISERY TOWARDS THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR EVER KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED AS THE SICK AND WEARY PRISONER MIGHT THINK OF THE POSSIBLE PILLORY
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE O ONE FOOL AS ULL TELL HIM HE'S WISE
AND FOR WEEKS NOW WHEN SHE HAS HOPED AT ALL IT HAS BEEN FOR SOMETHING AT WHICH SHE HERSELF TREMBLES AND SHUDDERS
I BUILD UPO THAT FOR I KNOW THE CAPTAIN LL SEE FOLKS RIGHTED IF HE CAN CHAPTER XXXV THE HIDDEN DREAD IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR ADAM--THE TIME BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER AND THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY AND HE COULD SEE LITTLE OF HETTY EXCEPT ON SUNDAYS
IT MIGHT TAKE THE DAY FOR WHAT SHE KNEW AND THAT WAS NOTHING TO THE REST OF THE JOURNEY
HE RAN BACK TO SETH AND THE TWO SONS LIFTED THE SAD BURDEN IN HEART-STRICKEN SILENCE
AND MR POYSER AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WAS TOO BUSY WITH HIS CARVING TO LISTEN TO BARTLE MASSEY'S OR MR CRAIG'S READY TALK
SHE ISN'T A NAUGHTY DELL THEE'ST GONE A BIT TOO FUR SAID MR POYSER
THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER MOUNT IN THE STABLE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS SERVANT BESIDES MEG AND RATTLER
NOT BE
SHE'S GOING TO PREACH ON THE GREEN TO-NIGHT
IT IS A BLIND CRY TO THEE
SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO SNOWFIELD O FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT AND I WENT LAST SUNDAY TO FETCH HER BACK
AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL
IN A FEW MINUTES PYM CAME DOWN WITH A LETTER IN HIS HAND AND GAVE IT TO ADAM SAYING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS TOO BUSY TO SEE HIM AND HAD WRITTEN EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY
HE HAD NO MORE DOUBT OR HESITATION AS TO HIS OWN WISHES THAN THE BIRD THAT FLIES TOWARDS THE OPENING THROUGH WHICH THE DAYLIGHT GLEAMS AND THE BREATH OF HEAVEN ENTERS
SO WAS THE SERMON WHICH MR IRWINE HAD CHOSEN WITH REFERENCE TO THIAS'S FUNERAL
SHE'S SO TIRED--SHE WANTS TO GO TO BED TOTTY TURNED HER FACE TOWARDS DINAH AND LOOKED AT HER AN INSTANT THEN LIFTED HERSELF UP PUT OUT HER LITTLE ARMS AND LET DINAH LIFT HER FROM HER MOTHER'S LAP
HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR SAID ADAM TREMULOUSLY
YOU'RE A DOUBLE-FACED MAN--I'LL NEVER BELIEVE A WORD YOU SAY AGAIN GO AWAY I TELL YOU SAID ARTHUR ANGRILY OR WE SHALL BOTH REPENT NO SAID ADAM WITH A CONVULSED VOICE I SWEAR I WON'T GO AWAY WITHOUT FIGHTING YOU
THE GRASP ON HIS ARM GRADUALLY RELAXED AND MR IRWINE THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR SAYING GO ON--I MUST KNOW IT THAT MAN PLAYED WITH HETTY'S FEELINGS AND BEHAVED TO HER AS HE'D NO RIGHT TO DO TO A GIRL IN HER STATION O LIFE--MADE HER PRESENTS AND USED TO GO AND MEET HER OUT A-WALKING
DEEDS OF KINDNESS WERE AS EASY TO HIM AS A BAD HABIT
FOR THE GREAT BARN-DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MR GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
TO BE SURE IT'S MORE LIKE A NAME FOR A DOG THAN A CHRISTIAN CHILD TOTTY'S A CAPITAL NAME
THERE THEY WERE--THE SWEET FACE AND NECK WITH THE DARK TENDRILS OF HAIR THE LONG DARK LASHES THE ROUNDED CHEEK AND THE POUTING LIPS--PALE AND THIN YES BUT LIKE HETTY AND ONLY HETTY
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT MARRY ADAM
IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE AND I IN YOURS I SHOULD TRY TO HELP YOU TO DO THE BEST ADAM MADE A HASTY MOVEMENT ON HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED ON THE GROUND
SHE WAS TOO ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF TRAVELING TO IMAGINE ANY OF ITS DETAILS AND WITH ALL HER STORE OF MONEY--HER THREE GUINEAS--IN HER POCKET SHE THOUGHT HERSELF AMPLY PROVIDED
AND HERE'S HETTY HAS PROMISED NO END O PARTNERS AN I'VE JUST BEEN ASKIN HER IF SHE'D AGREED TO DANCE WI YOU AN SHE SAYS NO WELL I DIDN'T THINK O DANCING TO-NIGHT SAID ADAM ALREADY TEMPTED TO CHANGE HIS MIND AS HE LOOKED AT HETTY
THEE'LT THINK THY MOTHER WAR GOOD FOR SUMMAT THEN DINAH SAID SETH DO COME AND SIT DOWN NOW AND HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST
WHAT'LL SHE TAKE FOR HER TEXT
SO THE GROUP IN THE VICINITY OF THE BLACKSMITH'S DOOR WAS BY NO MEANS A CLOSE ONE AND FORMED NO SCREEN IN FRONT OF CHAD CRANAGE THE BLACKSMITH HIMSELF WHO STOOD WITH HIS BLACK BRAWNY ARMS FOLDED LEANING AGAINST THE DOOR-POST AND OCCASIONALLY SENDING FORTH A BELLOWING LAUGH AT HIS OWN JOKES GIVING THEM A MARKED PREFERENCE OVER THE SARCASMS OF WIRY BEN WHO HAD RENOUNCED THE PLEASURES OF THE HOLLY BUSH FOR THE SAKE OF SEEING LIFE UNDER A NEW FORM
BUT ALL THIS HAPPENED YOU MUST REMEMBER NEARLY SIXTY YEARS AGO AND HETTY WAS QUITE UNEDUCATED--A SIMPLE FARMER'S GIRL TO WHOM A GENTLEMAN WITH A WHITE HAND WAS DAZZLING AS AN OLYMPIAN GOD
I WAS BROUGHT HUP AMONG THE GENTRY SIR AN GOT THE TURN O THEIR TONGUE WHEN I WAS A BYE
AT THE FAR GATE THERE WAS THE MARE HOLDING HER HEAD OVER THE BARS AND BESIDE HER THE LIVER-COLOURED FOAL WITH ITS HEAD TOWARDS ITS MOTHER'S FLANK APPARENTLY STILL MUCH EMBARRASSED BY ITS OWN STRADDLING EXISTENCE
BUT ON CONVIVIAL OCCASIONS MEN ARE APT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES STRONGLY
I'D NIVER WISH US TO LEAVE OUR LADS A SIXPENCE BUT WHAT WAS GOT I THE RIGHTFUL WAY
AND I HAD A WONDERFUL SENSE OF THE DIVINE LOVE AS WE WALKED OVER THE HILLS WHERE THERE'S NO TREES YOU KNOW SIR AS THERE IS HERE TO MAKE THE SKY LOOK SMALLER BUT YOU SEE THE HEAVENS STRETCHED OUT LIKE A TENT AND YOU FEEL THE EVERLASTING ARMS AROUND YOU
TO BE FRIGHTENED AT NOTHING
THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN PICKING UP AND NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN
THE SMALL BROWN HAND WITH WHICH SHE IS LIFTING HER QUEEN IS LADEN WITH PEARLS DIAMONDS AND TURQUOISES
SHE TOOK NO OFFENCE AT ME FOR ASKING AND THEE'ST MORE RIGHT THAN I HAD ONLY THEE'T NOT IN THE SOCIETY
IT WOULDN'T BE HALF SO GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH NOR FOR YOUR LUCK I LIFE
MISERABLE ABOUT HETTY
HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO WITHHOLD NOTHING FROM THE POYSERS BUT TO TELL THEM THE WORST AT ONCE FOR THERE WAS NO TIME TO ROB THE TIDINGS OF THEIR SUDDENNESS
BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WOULD TRY TO MEET HER WHEN SHE WENT TO THE CHASE TO-MORROW--AND IF HE SHOULD SPEAK TO HER AND WALK A LITTLE WAY WHEN NOBODY WAS BY
THE MEN UD NIVER RUN AFTER DINAH AS THEY WOULD AFTER HETTY WHAT CARE I WHAT THE MEN UD RUN AFTER
THE WORLD WILL NOT SEE THE GRAND EPOCH OF MY MAJORITY TWICE
AT LAST HE HAD FOUND A SLIGHT THING WHICH HE PUT FIRST IN HIS POCKET AND THEN ON A SECOND THOUGHT TOOK OUT AGAIN AND THRUST DEEP DOWN INTO A WASTE-PAPER BASKET
A SWEET WOMAN THE STRANGER SAID TO HIMSELF BUT SURELY NATURE NEVER MEANT HER FOR A PREACHER PERHAPS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO THINK THAT NATURE HAS THEATRICAL PROPERTIES AND WITH THE CONSIDERATE VIEW OF FACILITATING ART AND PSYCHOLOGY MAKES UP HER CHARACTERS SO THAT THERE MAY BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THEM
NAY--I'N GOTTEN SUMMAT ELSE TO THINK ON WAS AN ANSWER WHICH HE OFTEN UTTERED IN A TONE OF BITTER SIGNIFICANCE THAT SILENCED FURTHER QUESTION
AND SHE TEACHES ME CUTTING-OUT TOO WHAT
WE ARE LOST AS IF WE WAS STRUGGLING IN GREAT WATERS WHEN WE TRY TO THINK OF HIM
ONE MIGHT AS WELL GO AND LECTURE THE TREES FOR GROWING IN THEIR OWN SHAPE AND YOU NEVER FEEL ANY EMBARRASSMENT FROM THE SENSE OF YOUR YOUTH--THAT YOU ARE A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN ON WHOM MEN'S EYES ARE FIXED HE SAID ALOUD
THERE WAS NO COACH ON A SUNDAY BUT BY SETTING OUT BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT AND PERHAPS GETTING A LIFT IN A CART BY THE WAY HE WOULD ARRIVE PRETTY EARLY AT SNOWFIELD AND BRING BACK HETTY THE NEXT DAY--DINAH TOO IF SHE WERE COMING
I'VE A GREAT DEAL THAT'S PAINFUL ON MY MIND AND I FIND IT HARD WORK TO BE QUITE SILENT ABOUT MY OWN FEELINGS AND ONLY ATTEND TO OTHERS
I'LL GO INTO COURT
AND ACROSS ALL THIS REFLECTION WOULD DART EVERY NOW AND THEN A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF PASSIONATE DEFIANCE TOWARDS ALL CONSEQUENCES
THAT IS A BASE AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
THAT WAS A DEMONSTRATION THAT WORK ON SACRED DAYS WAS A WICKED THING
Y ARE A METHODY LIKE SETH
AN LET BE WHAT MAY I'D STRIVE TO DO MY PART BY A NIECE O YOURS--AN THAT I'VE DONE FOR I'VE TAUGHT HER EVERYTHING AS BELONGS TO A HOUSE AN I'VE TOLD HER HER DUTY OFTEN ENOUGH THOUGH GOD KNOWS I'VE NO BREATH TO SPARE AN THAT CATCHIN PAIN COMES ON DREADFUL BY TIMES
AH LAD
YES HE WOULD GO AND SEE HER THIS EVENING--IT WAS SO LONG SINCE HE HAD BEEN AT THE HALL FARM
FOR THOUGH I LIKE CHURCH BEST I DON'T PUT MY SOUL ABOVE YOURS AS IF MY WORDS WAS BETTER FOR YOU TO FOLLOW THAN YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK-EYED MAN
AND IT IS THE DROWSIEST TIME OF THE DAY TOO FOR IT IS CLOSE UPON THREE BY THE SUN AND IT IS HALF-PAST THREE BY MRS POYSER'S HANDSOME EIGHT-DAY CLOCK
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL HANG HER I'M AFRAID IT WILL GO HARD WITH HER
DARK AND CHEERLESS IS THE MORN UNACCOMPANIED BY THEE
THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR BY WHICH DINAH ENTERED AND SHE CAME IN SO GENTLY THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF HER PRESENCE TILL THEY HEARD HER VOICE SAYING SETH BEDE SETH STARTED AND THEY BOTH TURNED ROUND
HE THOUGHT YESTERDAY WHEN HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER AS THEY CAME OUT OF CHURCH THAT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY KINDNESS IN HER FACE SUCH AS HE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE AND HE TOOK IT AS A SIGN THAT SHE HAD SOME SYMPATHY WITH HIS FAMILY TROUBLE
I CAN BEAR NO MORE NOW
IT IS SO VERY RARELY THAT FACTS HIT THAT NICE MEDIUM REQUIRED BY OUR OWN ENLIGHTENED OPINIONS AND REFINED TASTE
AN THAT'S WHY I MAKE BOLD TO TROUBLE YOU WI IT HIS HONOUR BEING PRESENT TO BE SURE JOSHUA TO BE SURE THEY SHALL HAVE IT
BUT WHILE MR IRWINE WAS STILL SEATED LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STROKING JUNO'S HEAD THE SERVANT CAME TO THE DOOR AND SAID IF YOU PLEASE SIR JOSHUA RANN WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU IF YOU ARE AT LIBERTY LET HIM BE SHOWN IN HERE SAID MRS IRWINE TAKING UP HER KNITTING
THE CHILL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS TOO HARD TO BEAR
THEY ARE NOT ALIEN TO US--BUT THE MAN WHO TAKES THE WRONG SIDE ON THE MOMENTOUS SUBJECT OF THE HEBREW POINTS MUST BE TREATED AS THE ENEMY OF HIS RACE
SURELY IT IS NOT TRUE BLESSEDNESS TO BE FREE FROM SORROW WHILE THERE IS SORROW AND SIN IN THE WORLD
BUT EVEN TO THIS RULE AN EXCEPTION WILL OCCUR NOW AND THEN IN THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES AND MY FRIEND ADAM WAS ONE
HE WAS ONLY TWENTY-ONE AND THREE MONTHS AGO--NAY MUCH LATER--HE HAD THOUGHT PROUDLY THAT NO MAN SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO REPROACH HIM JUSTLY
SHE MUST BE ONE OF THE RACERS IN THE SACKS WHO HAD SET OFF BEFORE WE CAME THE BIT OF WOMANHOOD WAS OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE BESSY CRANAGE OTHERWISE CHAD'S BESS WHOSE LARGE RED CHEEKS AND BLOWSY PERSON HAD UNDERGONE AN EXAGGERATION OF COLOUR WHICH IF SHE HAD HAPPENED TO BE A HEAVENLY BODY WOULD HAVE MADE HER SUBLIME
AT THE STABLES HE ENCOUNTERED MR CRAIG WHO HAD COME TO LOOK AT THE CAPTAIN'S NEW HORSE ON WHICH HE WAS TO RIDE AWAY THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW
NO THERE COULD BE NO DANGER IN THAT QUARTER EVEN IF ARTHUR'S CHARACTER HAD NOT BEEN A STRONG SECURITY AGAINST IT
IF BILLY TAFT THE IDIOT WANTED TO LEARN ANYTHING I'D NOT REFUSE TO TEACH HIM
I WAS VERY HUNGRY AND I'D ONLY A BIT OF BREAD LEFT BUT I COULDN'T GO AWAY
WHAT MAN OF US IN THE FIRST MOMENTS OF A SHARP AGONY COULD EVER FEEL THAT THE FELLOW-MAN WHO HAS BEEN THE MEDIUM OF INFLICTING IT DID NOT MEAN TO HURT US
HITHERTO SINCE SUNDAY AFTERNOON ADAM HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY AMONG STRANGE PEOPLE AND IN STRANGE PLACES HAVING NO ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE DETAILS OF HIS DAILY LIFE AND NOW THAT BY THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW MORNING HE WAS COME BACK TO HIS HOME AND SURROUNDED BY THE FAMILIAR OBJECTS THAT SEEMED FOR EVER ROBBED OF THEIR CHARM THE REALITY--THE HARD INEVITABLE REALITY OF HIS TROUBLES PRESSED UPON HIM WITH A NEW WEIGHT
BREATHE UPON HER THY LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AND PUT A NEW FEAR WITHIN HER--THE FEAR OF HER SIN
HEY-DAY
SHE'S FIXED HER HEART ON A DIFFERENT SORT O LIFE VERY LIKE SAID LISBETH IMPATIENTLY VERY LIKE SHE'S NONE FOR MARR'ING WHEN THEM AS SHE'D BE WILLIN T MARRY WONNA AX HER
IN SPITE OF PRIDE AND TEMPER THERE WAS AS MUCH DEPRECATION AS ANGER IN HIS VOICE WHEN HE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN ADAM I MEAN SIR"--ANSWERED ADAM IN THE SAME HARSH VOICE STILL WITHOUT TURNING ROUND--"I MEAN SIR THAT YOU DON'T DECEIVE ME BY YOUR LIGHT WORDS
SHE MIGHT HA LOVED ME PERHAPS AS LIKELY AS ANY OTHER MAN--THERE'S NOBODY HEREABOUTS AS I'M AFRAID OF IF HE HADN'T COME BETWEEN US
SHE HAD LOCKED THE DOOR AND NOW HELD THE KEY IN HER HAND AS SHE THREW HERSELF WEARILY INTO A CHAIR THAT STOOD OUT OF ITS PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE FLOOR WHERE IN ORDINARY TIMES SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE CONSENTED TO SIT
TO MAKE ADAM THINK BETTER OF HIM THAN HE DESERVED
HE'S BEEN READING AND READING AND THINKS HE'S GOT TO THE BOTTOM ON'T
WE KNOW SHE HAD TO TAP TWICE BECAUSE HETTY HAD TO PUT OUT HER CANDLES AND THROW OFF HER BLACK LACE SCARF
EVEN HER OWN BEAUTY WAS INDIFFERENT TO HER
HE IS BESEECHING YOU AND YOU DON'T LISTEN TO HIM
SHE WAS TOO RIGOROUSLY TRUTHFUL FOR BENEVOLENT INVENTION BUT SHE HAD CONTRIVED TO SAY SOMETHING IN WHICH HETTY WAS TACITLY INCLUDED
FOR HETTY HAD THE LUXURIOUS NATURE OF A ROUND SOFT-COATED PET ANIMAL
BECAUSE HETTY YOU ARE SHUTTING UP YOUR SOUL AGAINST HIM BY TRYING TO HIDE THE TRUTH
IT'S WONDERFUL SHE DOESN'T LOVE TH LAD ADAM HAD SAID SOMETIMES TO HIMSELF FOR ANYBODY UD THINK HE WAS JUST CUT OUT FOR HER
ADAM WAS SILENT WITH SURPRISE AND CONJECTURE FOR SOME MOMENTS AND THEN HE SAID I HOPE I'VE NOT HURT OR DISPLEASED YOU BY WHAT I'VE SAID DINAH
SHE TREMBLED MORE AS SHE LOOKED AT HIM
AND OF MY OWN WILL IF I HAD NO CLEAR SHOWING TO THE CONTRARY I COULD FIND MY HAPPINESS IN BEING NEAR YOU AND MINISTERING TO YOU CONTINUALLY
HER SON ADAM'S BEEN AT HOME ALL DAY WORKING AT HIS FATHER'S COFFIN AND SHE LOVES TO HAVE HIM AT HOME
NOTHING FRESH AND BRIGHT BUT THE CHILDREN OPENING ROUND EYES AT THE SWIFT POST-CHAISE
THERE WAS NO NEWS COME--NO PARDON--NO REPRIEVE
FOR HIS WAS ONE OF THOSE LARGE-HEARTED SWEET-BLOODED NATURES THAT NEVER KNOW A NARROW OR A GRUDGING THOUGHT
WHAT HE SAID WON'T YOU FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN
AND TELL HER TO COME TO HER MOTHER IN THE DAIRY ADAM WALKED ROUND BY THE RICK-YARD AT PRESENT EMPTY OF RICKS TO THE LITTLE WOODEN GATE LEADING INTO THE GARDEN--ONCE THE WELL-TENDED KITCHEN-GARDEN OF A MANOR-HOUSE
SO MIND YOU DON'T DISGRACE MY JUDGMENT ARTHUR WINCED UNDER THIS SPEECH FOR KEEN OLD MRS IRWINE'S OPINION ABOUT HIM HAD THE DISAGREEABLE EFFECT OF A SINISTER OMEN
LIKE THOSE CLUMSY BELLS ROUND THE COWS NECKS IT HAS RATHER A COARSE SOUND WHEN IT COMES CLOSE AND MAY EVEN GRATE ON YOUR EARS PAINFULLY
NOT OF COURSE TO SPEAK IN THE CARESSING WAY INTO WHICH HE HAD UNGUARDEDLY FALLEN BEFORE DINNER BUT TO SET THINGS RIGHT WITH HER BY A KINDNESS WHICH WOULD HAVE THE AIR OF FRIENDLY CIVILITY AND PREVENT HER FROM RUNNING AWAY WITH WRONG NOTIONS ABOUT THEIR MUTUAL RELATION
HE MAY BE A SHEPHERD IN ARCADIA FOR AUGHT HE KNOWS HE MAY BE THE FIRST YOUTH KISSING THE FIRST MAIDEN HE MAY BE EROS HIMSELF SIPPING THE LIPS OF PSYCHE--IT IS ALL ONE
MY MAID HAS TAUGHT HER FINE NEEDLEWORK AND SHE HAS MENDED SOME LACE OF MINE VERY RESPECTABLY INDEED--VERY RESPECTABLY WHY SHE HAS LIVED WITH THE POYSERS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS MOTHER
IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH AND UPO FATHER TOO EH IT'S NO USE WORRETING
POOR HETTY'S VISION OF CONSEQUENCES AT NO TIME MORE THAN A NARROW FANTASTIC CALCULATION OF HER OWN PROBABLE PLEASURES AND PAINS WAS NOW QUITE SHUT OUT BY RECKLESS IRRITATION UNDER PRESENT SUFFERING AND SHE WAS READY FOR ONE OF THOSE CONVULSIVE MOTIVELESS ACTIONS BY WHICH WRETCHED MEN AND WOMEN LEAP FROM A TEMPORARY SORROW INTO A LIFELONG MISERY
AND SOON AFTER FOUR O'CLOCK SPLENDID OLD MRS IRWINE IN HER DAMASK SATIN AND JEWELS AND BLACK LACE WAS LED OUT BY ARTHUR FOLLOWED BY THE WHOLE FAMILY PARTY TO HER RAISED SEAT UNDER THE STRIPED MARQUEE WHERE SHE WAS TO GIVE OUT THE PRIZES TO THE VICTORS
WE ARE NONE OF US AWARE OF THE IMPRESSION WE PRODUCE ON BRAZILIAN MONKEYS OF FEEBLE UNDERSTANDING--IT IS POSSIBLE THEY SEE HARDLY ANYTHING IN US
IT HAD REQUIRED NO NOTICEABLE PAUSE FOR THIS RUSH AND REBOUND OF FEELING BEFORE HE ANSWERED BUT I THINK IT IS HARDLY AN ARGUMENT AGAINST A MAN'S GENERAL STRENGTH OF CHARACTER THAT HE SHOULD BE APT TO BE MASTERED BY LOVE
AND IF YOU HAD SEEN HIM MAKE HIS WAY ALONG THE SCHOOLROOM FLOOR AND UP THE STEP INTO HIS KITCHEN YOU WOULD PERHAPS HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHY THE NAUGHTY BOYS SOMETIMES FELT THAT HIS PACE MIGHT BE INDEFINITELY QUICKENED AND THAT HE AND HIS STICK MIGHT OVERTAKE THEM EVEN IN THEIR SWIFTEST RUN
HE FELT SURE HE SHOULD SLEEP NOW
AND AS FOR THE WEATHER THERE'S ONE ABOVE MAKES IT AND WE MUST PUT UP WI'T
LIKE MANY OTHER MEN HE THOUGHT THE SIGNS OF LOVE FOR ANOTHER WERE SIGNS OF LOVE TOWARDS HIMSELF
SHE'S ALL BUT A CHILD--AS ANY MAN WITH A CONSCIENCE IN HIM OUGHT TO FEEL BOUND TO TAKE CARE ON
ONE UD THINK AN HEAR SOME FOLKS TALK AS THE MEN WAR CUTE ENOUGH TO COUNT THE CORNS IN A BAG O WHEAT WI ONLY SMELLING AT IT
BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE FAMILY LIKENESS SEEMS ONLY TO RENDER MORE CONSPICUOUS THE REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE OF EXPRESSION BOTH IN FORM AND FACE
AND I KNOW AND YOU KNOW TOO WHAT UD BE THE CAPTAIN'S WISH ABOUT THE WOODS IF THERE WAS A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING A CHANGE
HE'D LEAVE HIS HEAD BEHIND HIM IF IT WAS LOOSE
SOME WILL PERHAPS THINK THAT THEY DETECT IN THE FIRST QUATRAIN AN INDICATION OF A LOST LINE WHICH LATER RHAPSODISTS FAILING IN IMAGINATIVE VIGOUR HAVE SUPPLIED BY THE FEEBLE DEVICE OF ITERATION
AND THERE IS BUT ONE WAY IN WHICH A STRONG DETERMINED SOUL CAN LEARN IT--BY GETTING HIS HEART-STRINGS BOUND ROUND THE WEAK AND ERRING SO THAT HE MUST SHARE NOT ONLY THE OUTWARD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR ERROR BUT THEIR INWARD SUFFERING
AND THEE MUST MAKE UP THY MIND AS I'LL NOT GIVE WAY TO THEE WHERE I'VE A RIGHT TO DO WHAT I LIKE
I TOOK A DEAL OF TROUBLE BOTH FOR THE CHILD AND THE MOTHER
TO BE SURE A STONE FLOOR WAS NOT THE PLEASANTEST TO DANCE ON BUT THEN MOST OF THE DANCERS HAD KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO ENJOY A CHRISTMAS DANCE ON KITCHEN QUARRIES
YE COMED IN SO LIGHT LIKE THE SHADOW ON THE WALL AN SPOKE I MY EAR AS I THOUGHT YE MIGHT BE A SPERRIT
I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY MRS POYSER INDEED SIR IT'S NOT FIT FOR YOU TO GO IN FOR HETTY'S IN THE MIDDLE O MAKING THE BUTTER FOR THE CHURNING WAS THROWN LATE AND I'M QUITE ASHAMED THIS MRS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK-PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
NOTHING COULD BE LESS LIKE THE ORDINARY TYPE OF THE RANTER THAN DINAH
YOU WISH TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SAD NEWS THAT HAS REACHED YOU...ABOUT HETTY SORREL NAY SIR WHAT I WISH TO KNOW IS ABOUT ADAM BEDE
I AM A LAZY FELLOW AND GET TERRIBLY HEAVY IN MY SADDLE
BUT BILL HAD A FIRM DETERMINATION THAT HE WOULD LEARN TO READ FOUNDED CHIEFLY ON TWO REASONS
THE FOOLISH CHILD FELT HER HEART SWELLING WITH DISCONTENT
THE CHEEKS WERE AS PINK AS EVER AND SHE SMILED AS MUCH AS SHE HAD EVER DONE OF LATE BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN HER EYES IN THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE IN ALL HER MOVEMENTS ADAM THOUGHT--SOMETHING HARDER OLDER LESS CHILD-LIKE
HE NEVER WENT TO EXETER HALL OR HEARD A POPULAR PREACHER OR READ TRACTS FOR THE TIMES OR SARTOR RESARTUS
SHE'S GOT A TOUCH OF HER OLD COMPLAINT AND SHE WANTS DINAH TO GO AND STAY WITH HER A BIT WELL WE'LL SPARE HER FOR YOUR MOTHER A LITTLE WHILE SAID MR POYSER
I HATE THAT TALK O PEOPLE AS IF THERE WAS A WAY O MAKING AMENDS FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY AS I LOVE HIM SHE SAID FAINTLY BUT IMPETUOUSLY PLUCKING ANOTHER ROUGH LEAF AND TEARING IT UP
A COVERED WAGGON WAS COMING CREEPING SLOWLY ALONG WITH A SLOUCHING DRIVER CRACKING HIS WHIP BESIDE THE HORSES
ANSWER ME THAT YOU RASCAL
AND PRESENTLY WHEN TOTTY WAS GONE SHE CAUGHT HIS EYE AND HER FACE BROKE INTO ONE OF ITS BRIGHTEST SMILES AS SHE NODDED TO HIM
GO LAD ADAM SAID IN A TONE OF ENCOURAGING COMMAND
DON'T YOU THINK SO HETTY YES SAID HETTY ABSTRACTEDLY FOR HER MIND HAD BEEN ALL THE WHILE IN THE WOOD AND SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT SHE WAS ASSENTING TO
SHE'S TAKIN TOO MUCH LIKIN TO THEM FOLKS I THE HOUSE KEEPER'S ROOM MRS POYSER REMARKED
AND THE COUNTRY-DANCES AND THE STAMPING AND THE GRACIOUS NODDING AND THE WAVING OF THE HANDS WENT ON JOYOUSLY
IT IS YET TIME--TIME TO SNATCH THIS POOR SOUL FROM EVERLASTING DARKNESS
WHAT DOST THINK HE CONTINUED TO HIS WIFE WHO NOW CAME BACK INTO THE HOUSE-PLACE KNITTING WITH FIERCE RAPIDITY AS IF THAT MOVEMENT WERE A NECESSARY FUNCTION LIKE THE TWITTERING OF A CRAB'S ANTENNAE
GOD KNOWS IT'S ALL THE JOY I COULD HAVE NOW TO THINK THE BEST OF YOU ARTHUR WANTED TO GO HOME WITHOUT SAYING ANY MORE--HE WAS TOO PAINFULLY EMBARRASSED IN MIND AS WELL AS TOO WEAK IN BODY TO WISH FOR ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION TO-NIGHT
AND I TOOK THE CHILD ON TO HETTON PARISH AND TOLD THE CONSTABLE AND WE WENT ON TO JUSTICE HARDY
I'M A POOR UN AT GUESSING SAID MR POYSER
THEY CARRIED HER TO THE SOFA AND LOOSENED HER DRESS
SHE WAS NOT AFRAID THAT ADAM WOULD TEASE HER WITH LOVE-MAKING AND FLATTERING SPEECHES LIKE HER OTHER ADMIRERS
IT TAKES SOME CONSCIENCE AND BELIEF IN RIGHT AND WRONG I SEE THAT PRETTY CLEAR
SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
HE ASKS ABOUT YOU AND THE POYSERS AS HE ALWAYS DOES
BUT I'VE SEEN PRETTY CLEAR EVER SINCE I WAS A YOUNG UN AS RELIGION'S SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES DOCTRINES AND NOTIONS
ABOVE ALL IT HAD A BRASS CANDLE-SOCKET ON EACH SIDE WHICH WOULD GIVE IT AN ARISTOCRATIC AIR TO THE VERY LAST
INDEED THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF ZEALOUS CLERGYMEN WAS SMALL AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT IF ONE AMONG THE SMALL MINORITY HAD OWNED THE LIVINGS OF BROXTON AND HAYSLOPE IN THE YEAR 1799 YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM NO BETTER THAN YOU LIKE MR IRWINE
AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL
YES DEAR ADAM WE MUST SUBMIT TO ANOTHER WILL
HE HAD NOT RESCUED HETTY NOR CHANGED THE PAST--THERE IT WAS JUST AS IT HAD BEEN AND HE SICKENED AT THE VANITY OF HIS OWN RAGE
LOVE HAS A WAY OF CHEATING ITSELF CONSCIOUSLY LIKE A CHILD WHO PLAYS AT SOLITARY HIDE-AND-SEEK
THEN SHE SAID SOFTLY HETTY THERE WAS A SLIGHT MOVEMENT PERCEPTIBLE IN HETTY'S FRAME--A START SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A FEEBLE ELECTRICAL SHOCK--BUT SHE DID NOT LOOK UP
I WAS ALWAYS TOO HARD ADAM SAID TO HIMSELF
SO IT WILL GO ON WORSENING AND WORSENING THOUGHT ADAM
THINK HOW HE'S STOOD BY US ALL WHEN IT'S BEEN NONE SO EASY--PAYING HIS SAVINGS TO FREE ME FROM GOING FOR A SOLDIER AN TURNIN HIS EARNIN'S INTO WOOD FOR FATHER WHEN HE'S GOT PLENTY O USES FOR HIS MONEY AND MANY A YOUNG MAN LIKE HIM UD HA BEEN MARRIED AND SETTLED BEFORE NOW
HE WAS TOO WISE TO UTTER SOOTHING WORDS AT PRESENT AND INDEED THE SIGHT OF ADAM BEFORE HIM WITH THAT LOOK OF SUDDEN AGE WHICH SOMETIMES COMES OVER A YOUNG FACE IN MOMENTS OF TERRIBLE EMOTION--THE HARD BLOODLESS LOOK OF THE SKIN THE DEEP LINES ABOUT THE QUIVERING MOUTH THE FURROWS IN THE BROW--THE SIGHT OF THIS STRONG FIRM MAN SHATTERED BY THE INVISIBLE STROKE OF SORROW MOVED HIM SO DEEPLY THAT SPEECH WAS NOT EASY
AND YET IF HE COULD SEE HER AGAIN WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO
AND IF OLD SQUIRE DONNITHORNE HAD ASKED HIM THE EFFECT OF THIS MISMANAGEMENT HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN HIS OPINION WITHOUT FLINCHING BUT THE IMPULSE TO A RESPECTFUL DEMEANOUR TOWARDS A GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN STRONG WITHIN HIM ALL THE WHILE
I KNOW I FEEL THE TERRIBLE EXTENT OF SUFFERING THIS SIN OF ARTHUR'S HAS CAUSED TO OTHERS
AN WHEN I'M GONE HE'LL BETHINK HIM AS NOBODY ULL NE'ER FIT'S LEG AN FOOT AS HIS OLD MOTHER DID
BUT DINAH WAS HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE MULTITUDE
BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO DANGER IN LEAVING IT UNFASTENED THAT LITTLE WHILE
THEY HAD THE PARTISANSHIP OF HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS WHO LIKE THEIR PLACES AND WERE NOT INCLINED TO GO THE FULL LENGTH OF THE SEVERE INDIGNATION FELT AGAINST HIM BY THE FARMING TENANTS BUT RATHER TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM
YOU'LL KEEP CLOSE TO ME NO HETTY I WON'T LEAVE YOU
THEN SHE KNEW MISS LYDIA WAS PASSING AND THOUGH HETTY LIKED SO MUCH TO LOOK AT HER FASHIONABLE LITTLE COAL-SCUTTLE BONNET WITH THE WREATH OF SMALL ROSES ROUND IT SHE DIDN'T MIND IT TO-DAY
WHY CARROLL MR IRWINE'S BUTLER HEARD HIM SAY SO TO THE PARSON NOT MANY DAYS AGO
I HOPE YOU WON'T LOOK HARSHLY ON HER IF SHE COMES BACK AS SHE MAY DO IF SHE FINDS IT HARD TO GET ON AWAY FROM HOME I CANNA LOOK ON HER AS I'VE DONE BEFORE SAID MARTIN DECISIVELY
HER RUIN CAN'T BE UNDONE
I WISH THEE WAST GOING ALL THE WAY WI ME AND AS HAPPY AS I AM I'M CONTENT ADDY I'M CONTENT SAID SETH CHEERFULLY
THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
WELL SAYS I YOU TALK O BONY'S CLIVERNESS
GOD IS WITHOUT END
WITH THIS THOUGHT SHE BEGAN TO PUT THE THINGS BACK INTO HER POCKET MEANING TO GET UP AND DRESS BEFORE THE LANDLADY CAME TO HER
I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU MEAN BY DIRECTION SAID MRS POYSER KNITTING IN A RAPID AND AGITATED MANNER
BUT TO THINK OF A NIECE O MINE BEING CAUSE O MY HUSBAND'S BEING TURNED OUT OF HIS FARM AND ME BROUGHT HIM NO FORTIN BUT MY SAVIN'S NAY DEAR AUNT RACHEL SAID DINAH GENTLY YOU'VE NO CAUSE FOR SUCH FEARS
BUT I MUST BE GOING NOW FOR I SUPPOSE THE RECTOR IS WAITING FOR ME WITH A GOOD-BYE A BRIGHT GLANCE AND A BOW TO HETTY ARTHUR LEFT THE DAIRY
THEY SAW NO REASON FOR THAT PREMATURE ENTRANCE--WHAT COULD THEY DO IN CHURCH IF THEY WERE THERE BEFORE SERVICE BEGAN?--AND THEY DID NOT CONCEIVE THAT ANY POWER IN THE UNIVERSE COULD TAKE IT ILL OF THEM IF THEY STAYED OUT AND TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT BUS'NESS CHAD CRANAGE LOOKS LIKE QUITE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE TO-DAY FOR HE HAS GOT HIS CLEAN SUNDAY FACE WHICH ALWAYS MAKES HIS LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER CRY AT HIM AS A STRANGER
I'VE CHARGED THE REGULAR PRICE FOR MY WORK AND I KNOW IT'S DONE WELL
HETTY DID NOT READ THE TEXT NOW
THERE'S PLENTY OF EMPLY I THIS COUNTRYSIDE SIR
YET ARTHUR WAS AT WINDSOR
HIS VOICE WAS VERY SOFT AND BEAUTIFUL NOT LIKE ANY VOICE I HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE
MRS POYSER HAD TAKEN THE TWO BOYS AWAY INTO THE DINING-ROOM TO GIVE THEM SOME CAKE BEFORE THEY WENT HOME IN THE CART WITH GRANDFATHER AND MOLLY WAS TO FOLLOW AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
ADAM REMEMBERED WELL THE NIGHT OF SHAME AND ANGUISH WHEN HE FIRST SAW HIS FATHER QUITE WILD AND FOOLISH SHOUTING A SONG OUT FITFULLY AMONG HIS DRUNKEN COMPANIONS AT THE WAGGON OVERTHROWN HE HAD RUN AWAY ONCE WHEN HE WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MAKING HIS ESCAPE IN THE MORNING TWILIGHT WITH A LITTLE BLUE BUNDLE OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS MENSURATION BOOK IN HIS POCKET AND SAYING TO HIMSELF VERY DECIDEDLY THAT HE COULD BEAR THE VEXATIONS OF HOME NO LONGER--HE WOULD GO AND SEEK HIS FORTUNE SETTING UP HIS STICK AT THE CROSSWAYS AND BENDING HIS STEPS THE WAY IT FELL
THE HOPES HE FELT ABOUT HETTY SOFTENED A LITTLE HIS FEELING TOWARDS ARTHUR
SHE COULD PERHAPS EVEN MAKE HIM BELIEVE THAT SHE DIDN'T CARE FOR ARTHUR
THEY WERE FARMING FOLKS A GOOD WAY OFF AND SHE'D HAD A LONG JOURNEY THAT HAD COST HER MORE MONEY THAN SHE EXPECTED SO AS SHE'D HARDLY ANY MONEY LEFT IN HER POCKET AND WAS AFRAID OF GOING WHERE IT WOULD COST HER MUCH
THE CAP'N'S BEEN RIDIN THE DEVIL'S OWN PACE SAID DALTON THE COACHMAN WHOSE PERSON STOOD OUT IN HIGH RELIEF AS HE SMOKED HIS PIPE AGAINST THE STABLE WALL WHEN JOHN BROUGHT UP RATTLER
WHY YOU'RE NOT VERY FIT FOR TRAVELLING SHE SAID GLANCING WHILE SHE SPOKE AT HETTY'S RINGLESS HAND
I PUT IT DOWN THERE AND COVERED IT UP AND WHEN I CAME BACK IT WAS GONE....IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO VERY MISERABLE DINAH...I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO...AND I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF BEFORE AND I COULDN'T
WHAT A STRANGE CONTRAST THE TWO FIGURES MADE VISIBLE ENOUGH IN THAT MINGLED TWILIGHT AND MOONLIGHT
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE ROOF PUSHING THE WALLS OUT AND I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT BEFORE WE SEND THE STUFF AND THE WORKMEN WHY BURGE TRUSTS ALMOST EVERYTHING TO YOU NOW ADAM DOESN'T HE
AN THEE'DST BE AS ANGRY AS COULD BE WI ME IF I SAID A WORD AGAINST ANYTHING SHE DID BECAUSE YOU'D VERY LIKE BE FINDING FAULT WI'OUT REASON SAID MRS POYSER
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO FEEL ANY DISPLEASURE ABOUT IT
HE'S NOT ONE O THEM AS IS ALL STRAW AND NO GRAIN
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO TEMPT HER TO DO THAT
BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A-MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A-SCOURING
ADAM FINDING THAT SHE DID NOT LOOK ROUND SO AS TO SEE THE SMILE ON HIS FACE WAS AFRAID SHE HAD THOUGHT HIM SERIOUS ABOUT HIS WRATHFULNESS AND WENT UP TO HER SO THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LOOK AT HIM
WASN'T HE HIMSELF SUFFERING
I'VE TOLD YOU ALREADY THAT YOU THINK TOO SERIOUSLY OF A LITTLE FLIRTATION
WITH THIS DROP OF INK AT THE END OF MY PEN I WILL SHOW YOU THE ROOMY WORKSHOP OF MR JONATHAN BURGE CARPENTER AND BUILDER IN THE VILLAGE OF HAYSLOPE AS IT APPEARED ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1799
WE SHOULD LEAVE OUR ROOTS BEHIND US I DOUBT AND NIVER THRIVE AGAIN CHAPTER XXXIII MORE LINKS THE BARLEY WAS ALL CARRIED AT LAST AND THE HARVEST SUPPERS WENT BY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE DISMAL BLACK CROP OF BEANS
BUT NOBODY NE'ER MARRIES THEM AS IS GOOD FOR AUGHT WELL MOTHER I HOPE THEE WILT HAVE HER FOR A DAUGHTER
ME DOIN TO CHURCH
AND TELL YOUR BROTHERS TO COME IN TOO TOTTY TROTTED OFF IN HER FLAPPING BONNET WHILE MRS POYSER SET OUT THE BRIGHT OAK TABLE AND REACHED DOWN THE TEA-CUPS
NAY MY LAD MY LAD THEE WOULDSTNA GO AWAY AN BREAK THY MOTHER'S HEART AN LEAVE THY FEYTHER TO RUIN
BARTLE MASSEY WAS GETTING UP TO LIFT THE STIFF LATCH OF THE DOOR FOR HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD REACH IT SHE HAD SAID GENTLY FAREWELL FRIEND AND WAS GONE WITH HER LIGHT STEP DOWN THE STAIRS
I SHARE YOUR CONCERN FOR ADAM THOUGH HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOSE SUFFERINGS I CARE FOR IN THIS AFFAIR
ADAM WOULD SOMETIMES GET UP AND TREAD BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ALONG THE SHORT SPACE FROM WALL TO WALL
HEGH HEGH SAID MR POYSER MEANING TO CHECK HER PLAYFULLY DON'T LET'S HAVE ANY CRYING
I DIDN'T GO TO GIVE INFORMATION BECAUSE I'D NO THOUGHT SHE MEANT TO DO ANY HARM AND I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER POCKET TO BUY HER FOOD AND LODGING
SHAKE HANDS WI ME LAD
SHE'S ACTED BAD BY YOU AND BY ALL OF US
THE CANDLE WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH--I SHALL SOON BE UP TO WALKING HOME NOW I CAN'T GO BEFORE I'VE SEEN YOU SAFE HOME SIR SAID ADAM HESITATINGLY
AFTER WHAT I SAW ON THURSDAY NIGHT HETTY HE BEGAN YOU WON'T THINK ME MAKING TOO FREE IN WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY
UNDER COVER OF THE NOISE MRS POYSER WENT INTO THE BACK KITCHEN TO SEND NANCY INTO THE CELLAR WITH THE GREAT PEWTER MEASURE WHICH HAD SOME CHANCE OF BEING FREE FROM BEWITCHMENT
AN YOU'VE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR'T WHEN IT'S DONE IF IT ISN'T A YALLOW FACE WI EATIN THINGS AS DISAGREE NAY NAY SAID MR POYSER WHO WAS IN HIS MERRIEST MOOD AND FELT THAT HE HAD HAD A GREAT DAY A BIT O PLEASURING'S GOOD FOR THEE SOMETIMES
THEY HAD REACHED ONE OF THOSE VERY NARROW PASSES BETWEEN TWO TALL STONES WHICH PERFORMED THE OFFICE OF A STILE IN LOAMSHIRE AND DINAH PAUSED AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS SETH AND SAID IN HER TENDER BUT CALM TREBLE NOTES SETH BEDE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE TOWARDS ME AND IF I COULD THINK OF ANY MAN AS MORE THAN A CHRISTIAN BROTHER I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU
AND AFTER THE MANNER OF WOMEN SHE MOURNED FOR THE FATHER WHO HAD MADE HER LIFE IMPORTANT ALL THE MORE BECAUSE SHE HAD A SECRET SENSE THAT THERE WAS LITTLE MOURNING FOR HIM IN OTHER HEARTS
PERHAPS WATER-NIXIES AND SUCH LOVELY THINGS WITHOUT SOULS HAVE THESE LITTLE ROUND HOLES IN THEIR EARS BY NATURE READY TO HANG JEWELS IN
AND HE WAS SURE THAT HER LOVE WHENEVER SHE GAVE IT WOULD BE THE MOST PRECIOUS THING A MAN COULD POSSESS ON EARTH
THERE'S NO DENYIN THAT BUT NOW LISBETH HEARD THE HEAVY THUD OF A RUNNING FOOTSTEP ON THE TURF AND TURNING QUICKLY TOWARDS THE DOOR SHE SAW ADAM ENTER LOOKING SO PALE AND OVERWHELMED THAT SHE SCREAMED ALOUD AND RUSHED TOWARDS HIM BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO SPEAK
ARE YOU GOING TO THE RECTORY NO SIR I'M GOING TO SEE ABOUT BRADWELL'S BARN
AN SHE'S AS FOND O THEE AS E'ER I WAR O THIAS POOR FELLOW THE BLOOD RUSHED TO ADAM'S FACE AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS NOT QUITE CONSCIOUS WHERE HE WAS
I HADN'T NEED KEEP Y OUT ANY LONGER THE TALL BUILDINGS ROUND THE YARD SHUT OUT A GOOD DEAL OF THE SKY BUT THE LARGE WINDOW LET IN ABUNDANT LIGHT TO SHOW EVERY CORNER OF THE HOUSE-PLACE
LET'S GO AND TELL HER ADAM WAS NOT THE ONLY GUEST INVITED TO COME UPSTAIRS ON OTHER GROUNDS THAN THE AMOUNT HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RENT-ROLL
FOR LET US DO WHAT WE WILL IT'S ONLY MAKING USE O THE SPERRIT AND THE POWERS THAT HA BEEN GIVEN TO US
FOR WHERE'S THE USE OF A WOMAN HAVING BRAINS OF HER OWN IF SHE'S TACKLED TO A GECK AS EVERYBODY'S A-LAUGHING AT
DOSTNA MEAN TO HA NO MORE NOR THAT BIT O OAT-CAKE
ANOTHER TIME HE SAID I CAME TO SEEK AND TO SAVE THAT WHICH WAS LOST
I'M RATHER LATE TO-DAY BECAUSE MY AUNT COULDN'T SPARE ME
EVERY ONE WAS IN THE MEADOW EVEN TO THE BLACK-AND-TAN TERRIER--NO ONE KEPT WATCH IN THE YARD BUT THE BULL-DOG
YOU KNOW I DO MIND PARTING WITH YOU DINAH YES DEAR FRIEND SAID DINAH TREMBLING BUT TRYING TO SPEAK CALMLY I KNOW YOU HAVE A BROTHER'S HEART TOWARDS ME AND WE SHALL OFTEN BE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN SPIRIT
AND THE NEXT BROADEST MUST SIT AT BOTTOM THIS HAPPY MODE OF SETTLING THE DISPUTE PRODUCED MUCH LAUGHTER--A SMALLER JOKE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR THAT MR CASSON HOWEVER DID NOT FEEL IT COMPATIBLE WITH HIS DIGNITY AND SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE TO JOIN IN THE LAUGH UNTIL IT TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN
THE HORSE IS HOT AND DISTRESSED BUT ANSWERS TO THE DESPERATE SPURRING
I NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOU ANY FURTHER WHAT TIME WILL IT BE CONVEN'ENT FOR ME TO SEE YOU TO-MORROW SIR SAID ADAM
SEE LORD I BRING HER AS THEY OF OLD BROUGHT THE SICK AND HELPLESS AND THOU DIDST HEAL THEM
BUT IF ADAM WERE THE SAME AGAIN AS IN THE OLD DAYS ARTHUR WISHED TO BE THE SAME TOO AND TO HAVE ADAM MIXED UP WITH HIS BUSINESS AND HIS FUTURE AS HE HAD ALWAYS DESIRED BEFORE THE ACCURSED MEETING IN AUGUST
LAY IT DOWN FOR ME IN THE HOUSE WILL YOU AYE SURE
THE STRANGER WAS STRUCK WITH SURPRISE AS HE SAW HER APPROACH AND MOUNT THE CART--SURPRISE NOT SO MUCH AT THE FEMININE DELICACY OF HER APPEARANCE AS AT THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR
A WORKING-MAN UD BE BADLY OFF WITHOUT A WIFE TO SEE TO TH HOUSE AND THE VICTUAL AND MAKE THINGS CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE NONSENSE
SO NOW SHE SLIPPED IT ON ALONG HER CHAIN OF DARK-BROWN BERRIES AND SNAPPED THE CHAIN ROUND HER NECK
BUT AS FOR DINAH POOR CHILD SHE'S NIVER LIKELY TO BE BUXOM AS LONG AS SHE'LL MAKE HER DINNER O CAKE AND WATER FOR THE SAKE O GIVING TO THEM AS WANT
OLD LEISURE WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT PERSONAGE
WE'VE GOT NO ROOM IN THE HOUSE A THIRD AS LARGE AS THIS
HE HATED TO SEE THE FELLOW LIFT THE PEWTER PINT TO HIS MOUTH IN THE BAR OF THE ROYAL GEORGE ON MARKET-DAY AND THE MERE SIGHT OF HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD BROUGHT A SEVERE AND CRITICAL EXPRESSION INTO HIS BLACK EYES AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATHERLY GLANCE HE BENT ON HIS TWO NIECES AS THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR
FOR THERE WAS A CERTAIN VIRTUE IN THAT BENIGNANT YET KEEN COUNTENANCE AS THERE IS IN ALL HUMAN FACES FROM WHICH A GENEROUS SOUL BEAMS OUT
THE HOPE ALLAYED HIS ANGER A LITTLE
HER FIRST FEELING HAD BEEN THAT ADAM WOULD BE VERY ANGRY WITH HER AND PERHAPS WOULD TELL HER AUNT AND UNCLE BUT IT NEVER ENTERED HER MIND THAT HE WOULD DARE TO SAY ANYTHING TO CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE
YOU SPEAK FAIR AN Y ACT FAIR AN WE'RE JOYFUL WHEN WE LOOK FORRARD TO YOUR BEING OUR LANDLORD FOR WE B'LIEVE YOU MEAN TO DO RIGHT BY EVERYBODY AN ULL MAKE NO MAN'S BREAD BITTER TO HIM IF YOU CAN HELP IT
IT WAS AT THE CORNER OF THE TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW AND THERE WAS A BOOK LYING ON THE TABLE BUT IT WAS NOT OPEN
THEY WERE NEARLY OF THE SAME HEIGHT
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN'T PREVAIL ON PEOPLE TO DO WITH KINDNESS
THESE THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN MUCH BORNE IN ON ME OF LATE AND I HAVE SEEN WITH NEW CLEARNESS THE MEANING OF THOSE WORDS IF ANY MAN LOVE ME LET HIM TAKE UP MY CROSS I HAVE HEARD THIS ENLARGED ON AS IF IT MEANT THE TROUBLES AND PERSECUTIONS WE BRING ON OURSELVES BY CONFESSING JESUS
AND IF WILL MASKERY DOESN'T LIKE TO JOIN YOU BUT TO GO TO A PRAYER-MEETING AT TREDDLESTON INSTEAD LET HIM
YOU CAN'T THINK WHAT AN OLD FELLOW I FEEL HE SAYS
POSSIBLY YOU THINK THAT ADAM WAS NOT AT ALL SAGACIOUS IN HIS INTERPRETATIONS AND THAT IT WAS ALTOGETHER EXTREMELY UNBECOMING IN A SENSIBLE MAN TO BEHAVE AS HE DID--FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GIRL WHO REALLY HAD NOTHING MORE THAN HER BEAUTY TO RECOMMEND HER ATTRIBUTING IMAGINARY VIRTUES TO HER AND EVEN CONDESCENDING TO CLEAVE TO HER AFTER SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER MAN WAITING FOR HER KIND LOOKS AS A PATIENT TREMBLING DOG WAITS FOR HIS MASTER'S EYE TO BE TURNED UPON HIM
SUCH A SALLOW-FACED GIRL
GOOD-BYE MOTHER SAID ADAM KISSING HER AND HURRYING AWAY
IT'S WELL IF I CAN REMEMBER A LITTLE INAPPLICABLE LATIN TO ADORN MY MAIDEN SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS HENCE
YOU WILL GO WITH ME TO STONITON ADAM HE SAID AGAIN AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
HE RESOLUTELY TURNED AWAY HIS EYES FROM ANY BAD CONSEQUENCE THAT WAS NOT DEMONSTRABLY INEVITABLE
BUT IT'S NATURAL YOU SHOULDN'T FOR I'M NOT SO GOOD AS YOU
THAT WAS OFTEN DINAH'S MODE OF PRAYING IN SOLITUDE
HE HAS THE SUNKEN EYES THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK-BED
WILT GO TO COUSIN HETTY MY DILLING WHILE MOTHER GETS READY TO GO TO BED
HE IS NEARLY AS TALL
IF DINAH UD BE WILLING TO STAY AT HAYSLOPE IT ISN'T LIKELY SHE CAN COME AWAY FROM HER AUNT'S HOUSE WHERE THEY HOLD HER LIKE A DAUGHTER AND WHERE SHE'S MORE BOUND THAN SHE IS TO US
DINAH RAISED HER GENTLY FROM HER KNEES AND SEATED HER ON THE PALLET AGAIN SITTING DOWN BY HER SIDE
YOU SHALL GO WHERE YOU LIKE AMONG THE PEOPLE AND TEACH EM
I KNOW YOU LIKE EM
NOT AS I'M A-FINDING FAUT WI MY HUSBAND FOR IF HE'S A MAN O FEW WORDS WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL STAND TO I'M SURE I NEVER SAW A PRETTIER PARTY THAN THIS ARTHUR SAID LOOKING ROUND AT THE APPLE-CHEEKED CHILDREN
I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SO WHEN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FIELDS AND WOODS HAVE LOOKED TO ME LIKE OUR ENGLISH LOAMSHIRE--THE RICH LAND TILLED WITH JUST AS MUCH CARE THE WOODS ROLLING DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPES TO THE GREEN MEADOWS--I HAVE COME ON SOMETHING BY THE ROADSIDE WHICH HAS REMINDED ME THAT I AM NOT IN LOAMSHIRE
IT'S A DEEP MYSTERY--THE WAY THE HEART OF MAN TURNS TO ONE WOMAN OUT OF ALL THE REST HE'S SEEN I THE WORLD AND MAKES IT EASIER FOR HIM TO WORK SEVEN YEAR FOR HER LIKE JACOB DID FOR RACHEL SOONER THAN HAVE ANY OTHER WOMAN FOR TH ASKING
I WAS QUITE DRAWN OUT TO SPEAK TO HIM
HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS
IS IT ANY WEAKNESS PRAY TO BE WROUGHT ON BY EXQUISITE MUSIC
I'M GOING TO TEA WITH HER TO-MORROW AFTERNOON THE REASON WHY THERE HAD BEEN SPACE FOR THIS TETE-A-TETE CAN ONLY BE KNOWN BY LOOKING INTO THE BACK KITCHEN WHERE TOTTY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED RUBBING A STRAY BLUE-BAG AGAINST HER NOSE AND IN THE SAME MOMENT ALLOWING SOME LIBERAL INDIGO DROPS TO FALL ON HER AFTERNOON PINAFORE
DIVE ME A PEPPERMINT GRANDAD SHAKING WITH LAUGHTER AT THIS DEEP LITTLE WENCH SLOWLY TRANSFERRED HIS STICK TO HIS LEFT HAND WHICH HELD THE GATE OPEN AND SLOWLY THRUST HIS FINGER INTO THE WAISTCOAT POCKET ON WHICH TOTTY HAD FIXED HER EYES WITH A CONFIDENT LOOK OF EXPECTATION
NOT THAT SHE CARED TO ASK HIM THE QUESTION BUT SHE HOPED THE INFORMATION WOULD BE GIVEN SPONTANEOUSLY
WHEN ONCE HE HAD COME TO THIS CONCLUSION HE TURNED MEG ROUND AND SET OFF HOME AGAIN IN A CANTER
OH IT DOESN'T MATTER I DON'T MIND ABOUT IT SAID HETTY WHO HAD BEEN PALE AND WAS NOW RED
AYE THEM AS CHOOSE A SOFT FOR A WIFE MAY'S WELL BUY UP THE SHORTHORNS FOR IF YOU GET YOUR HEAD STUCK IN A BOG YOUR LEGS MAY'S WELL GO AFTER IT
HE SAID--AND HE'S IN THE RIGHT OF IT--AS IT'LL BE BAD FOR HIM T HAVE HIS FEELINGS STIRRED WITH SEEING MANY PEOPLE ONE AFTER ANOTHER
SHE'LL BE A POOR DRATCHELL BY THEN SHE'S THIRTY A-MARR'IN A-THAT'N AFORE HER TEETH'S ALL COME ADAM WALKED SO FAST THAT HE WAS AT THE YARD-GATE BEFORE SEVEN
AND IN TWO MOMENTS HE WAS AT THE BRIDGE
IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
SHE THOUGHT THIS COACHMAN MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT HER
THE LAST TIME THEY HAD MET HIS WAS WHEN HE PARTED FROM HER WITH HIS HEART FULL OF JOYOUS HOPEFUL LOVE AND THEY LOOKED OUT WITH A TEARFUL SMILE FROM A PINK DIMPLED CHILDISH FACE
THEY OUGHTN'T TO CAST HER OFF--HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
WILL YOU GO THERE WITH ME AND SIT DOWN
TO BE SURE THAT ALL THINGS WILL TURN TO GOOD
SHE CAN'T BE GUILTY
WHERE IS SHE I KNOW NOBODY BY THAT NAME SAID THE OLD WOMAN WONDERINGLY
MARTIN POYSER HAD SOME FAINT CONCEPTION OF THE FLAVOUR SUCH MEN MUST FIND IN HOT ROAST BEEF AND FRESH-DRAWN ALE
HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
AND EVEN THE MAN MOSES THE MEEKEST OF MEN WAS WRATHFUL SOMETIMES COME THEN SAID ADAM LOOKING AT HER AFFECTIONATELY I'LL HELP YOU MOVE THE THINGS AND PUT EM BACK AGAIN AND THEN THEY CAN'T GET WRONG
I DARESAY NOW EVEN A MAN FORTIFIED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLASSICS MIGHT BE LURED INTO AN IMPRUDENT MARRIAGE IN SPITE OF THE WARNING GIVEN HIM BY THE CHORUS IN THE PROMETHEUS THE SMILE THAT FLITTED ACROSS ARTHUR'S FACE WAS A FAINT ONE AND INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING MR IRWINE'S PLAYFUL LEAD HE SAID QUITE SERIOUSLY--"YES THAT'S THE WORST OF IT
NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE AND YET BOTH WISHED THEY COULD SPEAK AS ADAM ENTERED AND THEY SAT DOWN
HE WAS ALWAYS POLITE
I'LL DANCE THAT WITH YOU IF YOU LIKE AH SAID MR POYSER BUT YOU MUN DANCE THE FIRST DANCE ADAM ELSE IT'LL LOOK PARTIC'LER
I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF I SHOULD GO MAD WITH THINKING OF HER LOOKS AND WHAT SHE SAID TO ME AND THEN THAT I COULDN'T GET A FULL PARDON--THAT I COULDN'T SAVE HER FROM THAT WRETCHED FATE OF BEING TRANSPORTED--THAT I CAN DO NOTHING FOR HER ALL THOSE YEARS
TELL ME THE TRUTH YES MY LAD YES
IT'S CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE AS IS TH HEIR SIR--SQUIRE DONNITHORNE'S GRANDSON
HE FELT A LITTLE VEXED FOR HIS BROTHER'S SAKE AND HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING REGRETFULLY HOW DINAH AS SETH'S WIFE WOULD HAVE MADE THEIR HOME AS HAPPY AS IT COULD BE FOR THEM ALL--HOW SHE WAS THE ONE BEING THAT WOULD HAVE SOOTHED THEIR MOTHER'S LAST DAYS INTO PEACEFULNESS AND REST
THE DOOR CLOSED AGAIN AND THE ONLY LIGHT IN THE CELL WAS THAT OF THE EVENING SKY THROUGH THE SMALL HIGH GRATING--ENOUGH TO DISCERN HUMAN FACES BY
WHEREUPON FOLLOWED THAT PLEASANT CONFUSION OF LAUGHING INTERJECTIONS AND HAND-SHAKINGS AND HOW ARE YOU'S MINGLED WITH JOYOUS SHORT BARKS AND WAGGING OF TAILS ON THE PART OF THE CANINE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHICH TELLS THAT THE VISITOR IS ON THE BEST TERMS WITH THE VISITED
BUT IF ADAM'S FOOL ENOUGH TO CARE ABOUT IT I DON'T WANT HIM TO SUFFER MORE THAN'S NEEDFUL....IS HE VERY MUCH CUT UP POOR FELLOW BARTLE ADDED TAKING OUT HIS SPECTACLES AND PUTTING THEM ON AS IF THEY WOULD ASSIST HIS IMAGINATION
AND WHEN THE WOMAN WENT OUT I FELT AS IF I WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING...I THOUGHT I SHOULD GET RID OF ALL MY MISERY AND GO BACK HOME AND NEVER LET EM KNOW WHY I RAN AWAY I PUT ON MY BONNET AND SHAWL AND WENT OUT INTO THE DARK STREET WITH THE BABY UNDER MY CLOAK
BUT YOU SEE HE WAS SOURISH-TEMPERED AND WAS FOR BEATING DOWN PRICES WITH THE PEOPLE AS WORKED FOR HIM
THE MIDDAY LIGHT THAT FELL ON THE CLOSE PAVEMENT OF HUMAN HEADS WAS SHED THROUGH A LINE OF HIGH POINTED WINDOWS VARIEGATED WITH THE MELLOW TINTS OF OLD PAINTED GLASS
THE WORLD IS NOT JUST WHAT WE LIKE
IF SO YOU WILL NO MORE THINK THE SLIGHT WORDS THE TIMID LOOKS THE TREMULOUS TOUCHES BY WHICH TWO HUMAN SOULS APPROACH EACH OTHER GRADUALLY LIKE TWO LITTLE QUIVERING RAIN-STREAMS BEFORE THEY MINGLE INTO ONE--YOU WILL NO MORE THINK THESE THINGS TRIVIAL THAN YOU WILL THINK THE FIRST-DETECTED SIGNS OF COMING SPRING TRIVIAL THOUGH THEY BE BUT A FAINT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING IN THE AIR AND IN THE SONG OF THE BIRDS AND THE TINIEST PERCEPTIBLE BUDDING ON THE HEDGE-ROW BRANCHES
HETTY TURNED AWAY WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF ILL HUMOUR AND TAKING HER HAT FROM THE TABLE STOOD WAITING WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE TO SEE IF SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO DO ANYTHING ELSE
ADAM DOESNA PICK A THAT'N
HETTY HAD NEVER READ A NOVEL
FOR THOUGHTS ARE SO GREAT--AREN'T THEY SIR
THOUGH ARTHUR FOR HIS PART THOUGHT GIRLS WERE NOT BY ANY MEANS SO SOFT AND EASILY BRUISED
SHE HAD NOT THE IDEAS THAT COULD MAKE UP THE NOTION OF THAT MISERY
WHAT DO YOU THINK MR MASSEY
FOR HETTY COULD CONCEIVE NO OTHER EXISTENCE FOR HERSELF IN FUTURE THAN A HIDDEN ONE AND A HIDDEN LIFE EVEN WITH LOVE WOULD HAVE HAD NO DELIGHTS FOR HER
DINAH SAID NOTHING BUT PRESENTLY USED THE OPPORTUNITY OF QUIETLY JOINING THE BROTHERS IN THE WORKSHOP
HOW PRETTY IT LOOKED WITH ITS PARTI-COLOURED SAIL IN THE SUNLIGHT MOORED IN THE QUIET BAY
HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT COMFORT HER AND LULL HER INTO DREAMING ON
YOU'LL BE DOING HER A HURT BY SPARING HIM AND I HOLD HIM THE GUILTIEST BEFORE GOD LET HER HA DONE WHAT SHE MAY
THAT'S A BIT OF GOOD NEWS TO CHEER ARTHUR SAID MR IRWINE TO HIS MOTHER AS THEY DROVE OFF
AN THEN YOU CAN COME AND TAKE THE LITTLE UN WHILE YOUR AUNT UNDRESSES HERSELF FOR SHE WON'T LIE DOWN IN BED WITHOUT HER MOTHER
THE REASON ADAM WAS WALKING ALONG THE LANES AT THIS TIME WAS BECAUSE HIS WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY LAY AT A COUNTRY-HOUSE ABOUT THREE MILES OFF WHICH WAS BEING PUT IN REPAIR FOR THE SON OF A NEIGHBOURING SQUIRE
I DOUBT IT MUST BE SO HETTY HE SAID TENDERLY
BUT THE ARMS COULD NOT REACH HER
THAT SEEMS BUT A SLIGHT JOURNEY AS YOU LOOK AT THE MAP OR REMEMBER YOUR OWN PLEASANT TRAVELS TO AND FROM THE MEADOWY BANKS OF THE AVON
WITH STEADFAST PATIENCE ARM MY BREAST WITH SPOTLESS LOVE AND HOLY FEAR
IT'S THAT NEST O MINISTERS DOES THE MISCHIEF I TELL YOU AH IT'S FINE TALKING OBSERVED MRS POYSER WHO WAS NOW SEATED NEAR HER HUSBAND WITH TOTTY ON HER LAP--"IT'S FINE TALKING
AT FIRST SHE ONLY NODDED EMPHATICALLY BUT SHE WAS PRESENTLY UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO BE MORE EXPLICIT
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO ADD BY ONE WORD OF REPROACH TO THE RETRIBUTION THAT IS NOW FALLING ON YOU
YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU
LORD THOU ART WITH THY PEOPLE STILL
IF MY FOOL'S HEAD WEIGHED FOUR POUND AND JACK'S THREE POUND THREE OUNCES AND THREE QUARTERS HOW MANY PENNYWEIGHTS HEAVIER WOULD MY HEAD BE THAN JACK'S A MAN THAT HAD GOT HIS HEART IN LEARNING FIGURES WOULD MAKE SUMS FOR HIMSELF AND WORK EM IN HIS HEAD
IT IS CLEAR AT A GLANCE THAT THE NEXT WORKMAN IS ADAM'S BROTHER
I WAS NEVER SO SHOCKED IN MY LIFE AS AT THE CHANGE IN HER
BUT IT SETS MY TEETH ON EDGE--IT SETS MY TEETH ON EDGE CHAPTER LIV THE MEETING ON THE HILL ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
ANOTHER DAY'S RAIN UD COVER THE PLANK AND WE SHOULD HAVE TO GO ROUND BY THE ROAD THEY WERE COMING ACROSS THE VALLEY NOW AND HAD ENTERED THE PASTURE THROUGH WHICH THE BROOK RAN
HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN
HE FEIGNED NOT TO HEAR AND TO BE OCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
IT IS BUT LITTLE I CAN DO I KNOW
SEVERAL CLOTHES-HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING-WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
MR IRWINE MEANWHILE WENT OUT TO GIVE SOME ORDERS
SHE RAN TO FIND TOTTY AND SOON REAPPEARED WITH RECOVERED COLOUR LEADING TOTTY WHO WAS MAKING A SOUR FACE BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO THROW AWAY AN UNRIPE APPLE THAT SHE HAD SET HER SMALL TEETH IN
YOU ARE TOO EASY-TEMPERED DAUPHIN WHY MOTHER YOU DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF SUSTAINING MY DIGNITY TO SET ABOUT VINDICATING MYSELF FROM THE ASPERSIONS OF WILL MASKERY
EITHER TELL ME SHE CAN NEVER BE MY WIFE--TELL ME YOU'VE BEEN LYING--OR ELSE PROMISE ME WHAT I'VE SAID ADAM UTTERING THIS ALTERNATIVE STOOD LIKE A TERRIBLE FATE BEFORE ARTHUR WHO HAD MOVED FORWARD A STEP OR TWO AND NOW STOPPED FAINT SHAKEN SICK IN MIND AND BODY
I NEVER THOUGHT O STIRRING I FELT SO WEAK
TO MAKE A GOOD JOB OF ANYTHING HOWEVER SMALL WAS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO ADAM AND HE SAT ON A BLOCK WITH HIS BOOK RESTING ON A PLANING-TABLE WHISTLING LOW EVERY NOW AND THEN AND TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A JUST PERCEPTIBLE SMILE OF GRATIFICATION--OF PRIDE TOO FOR IF ADAM LOVED A BIT OF GOOD WORK HE LOVED ALSO TO THINK I DID IT AND I BELIEVE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE FREE FROM THAT WEAKNESS ARE THOSE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO CALL THEIR OWN
THE TWO PALE FACES WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
WHERE DIDST SEE HIM ASKED SETH AS THEY WALKED ON INTO THE ADJOINING FIELD
THE IRWINES SHOULD DINE WITH HIM EVERY WEEK AND HAVE THEIR OWN CARRIAGE TO COME IN FOR IN SOME VERY DELICATE WAY THAT ARTHUR WOULD DEVISE THE LAY-IMPROPRIATOR OF THE HAYSLOPE TITHES WOULD INSIST ON PAYING A COUPLE OF HUNDREDS MORE TO THE VICAR
I'M NOT A THIEF NO THAT YOU AREN'T I'LL BE BOUND SAID THE LANDLADY
WHY WHAT'S PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD MY WENCH HE SAID AT LAST AFTER HE HAD GIVEN ONE CONSERVATIVE PUFF
WHICH WAS YE THINKIN ON SETH HE BEGAN--"THE PRETTY PARSON'S FACE OR HER SARMUNT WHEN YE FORGOT THE PANELS COME AND HEAR HER BEN SAID SETH GOOD-HUMOUREDLY
HE MAY SAY SUCH A THING WHEN HE'S IN WRATH--AND HE'S GOT EXCUSE FOR BEING WRATHFUL SOMETIMES--BUT HIS HEART UD NEVER LET HIM GO
HIS OWN MIND IS IN A VERY PERTURBED STATE AND IT IS BEST HE SHOULD NOT SEE YOU TILL YOU ARE CALMER IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR
BEFORE YOU DESPISE ADAM AS DEFICIENT IN PENETRATION PRAY ASK YOURSELF IF YOU WERE EVER PREDISPOSED TO BELIEVE EVIL OF ANY PRETTY WOMAN--IF YOU EVER COULD WITHOUT HARD HEAD-BREAKING DEMONSTRATION BELIEVE EVIL OF THE ONE SUPREMELY PRETTY WOMAN WHO HAS BEWITCHED YOU
FOR YOU'RE TOO FEATHER-HEADED TO MIND IF EVERYBODY WAS DEAD SO AS YOU COULD STAY UPSTAIRS A-DRESSING YOURSELF FOR TWO HOURS BY THE CLOCK
I MUST HAVE YOUR OPINION TOO HETTY RUN AND TELL YOUR UNCLE TO COME IN SAID MRS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY
THAT FACE IS LOOKING AT YOU NOW"--HERE DINAH POINTED TO A SPOT CLOSE IN FRONT OF BESSY--"AH TEAR OFF THOSE FOLLIES
ONE OF MY REASONS FOR GOING AWAY IS THAT NO ONE ELSE MAY LEAVE HAYSLOPE--MAY LEAVE THEIR HOME ON MY ACCOUNT
THE HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT A PLAIN SQUARE MANSION OF QUEEN ANNE'S TIME BUT FOR THE REMNANT OF AN OLD ABBEY TO WHICH IT WAS UNITED AT ONE END IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS ONE MAY SOMETIMES SEE A NEW FARMHOUSE RISING HIGH AND PRIM AT THE END OF OLDER AND LOWER FARM-OFFICES
I SAVED EM O PURPOSE FOR THEE
STILL LESS A LIFE MINGLED WITH SHAME
HAVE YOU NO IDEA OF THE REASON WHY SHE WENT AWAY HE SAID
BUT I'M BETTER NOW
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE ARE TAKEN FROM US AND WE CAN JOY IN NOTHING BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WITH US
WHY DID THEY SAY SHE WAS SO CHANGED
WILL MASKERY MIGHT BE A GREAT DEAL WORSE FELLOW THAN HE IS
HE GOT UP AND THREW OPEN THE WINDOWS TO LET IN THE SOFT BREATH OF THE AFTERNOON AND THE HEALTHY SCENT OF THE FIRS THAT MADE A BELT ROUND THE HERMITAGE
BUT THERE'S NO GENTLEMAN THERE RETURNED THE LANDLORD
PERHAPS HE LONGED ALL THE MORE TO MAKE THIS CONFESSION THAT HIS INDIGNATION MIGHT BE FREE AGAIN
THE SUSCEPTIBILITY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IMPELLING FORCE WHERE THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF ACTION BECAME HELPLESS ANGUISH WHEN HE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PASSIVE OR ELSE SOUGHT AN ACTIVE OUTLET IN THE THOUGHT OF INFLICTING JUSTICE ON ARTHUR
HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE COULD FORGET ARTHUR
CHAPTER XLVIII ANOTHER MEETING IN THE WOOD THE NEXT DAY AT EVENING TWO MEN WERE WALKING FROM OPPOSITE POINTS TOWARDS THE SAME SCENE DRAWN THITHER BY A COMMON MEMORY
THERE WAS THE CHAIR IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE ADAM REMEMBERED SITTING
BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL NOT WONDER WHEN I SAY THAT AMONG ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN THE ONE IN WHOM I HAVE THE STRONGEST INTEREST IS MY FRIEND MR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE FOR WHOM YOU HAVE JUST EXPRESSED YOUR REGARD
WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN POOR COTTAGES AND HAVE BEEN REARED ON OAT-CAKE AND LIVED COARSE
AS HE CURTSIED ALONG WITH HIS EYES UPTURNED TO THE STRAW KNOBS IMITATIVE OF GOLDEN GLOBES AT THE SUMMITS OF THE BEEHIVE RICKS WHICH INDEED WERE GOLD OF THE BEST SORT YOU MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED HIM TO BE ENGAGED IN SOME PAGAN ACT OF ADORATION
DINAH DID NOT KNOW THAT THE CROWD WAS SILENT GAZING AT HER WITH A SORT OF AWE--SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW HOW NEAR THEY WERE TO THE FATAL SPOT WHEN THE CART STOPPED AND SHE SHRANK APPALLED AT A LOUD SHOUT HIDEOUS TO HER EAR LIKE A VAST YELL OF DEMONS
WHEN AT LAST SHE REACHED STONY STRATFORD HER IMPATIENCE AND WEARINESS HAD BECOME TOO STRONG FOR HER ECONOMICAL CAUTION
BUT IF ARISTIDES THE JUST WAS EVER IN LOVE AND JEALOUS HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT NOT PERFECTLY MAGNANIMOUS
AN IT WAS A GREAT HONOUR FOR THE YOUNG SQUIRE TO ASK THEE FIRST--I RECKON IT WAS BECAUSE I SAT AT TH HEAD O THE TABLE AN MADE THE SPEECH
AND THEN RUN AWAY SO SUDDENLY
I SHALL LOOK T HER TO HELP ME TO SEE THINGS RIGHT
AND IF THERE WERE SUCH A THING AS TAKING AVERAGES OF FEELING IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE FOUND THAT IN THE HUNTING AND SHOOTING SEASONS REGRET SELF-REPROACH AND MORTIFIED PRIDE WEIGH LIGHTER ON COUNTRY GENTLEMEN THAN IN LATE SPRING AND SUMMER
BUT HE GUESSED WHERE MRS POYSER AND SOME ONE ELSE WOULD BE QUITE WITHIN HEARING
PRESENTLY AS SHE WALKED ON WEARILY SHE HEARD THE RUMBLING OF HEAVY WHEELS BEHIND HER
SOME ONE HAD SAID THERE WERE TO BE CLOAKS AND OTHER NICE CLOTHES FOR PRIZES AND SHE APPROACHED THE MARQUEE FANNING HERSELF WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF BUT WITH EXULTATION SPARKLING IN HER ROUND EYES
ADAM SAT LOOKING AT THE CLOCK
YOU'LL STAY TILL THE END O THE WEEK DINAH YES YES SAID MR POYSER
WIRY BEN'S PRIDE IN HIS DANCING--AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PRODUCTIVE OF GREAT EFFECT AT THE YEARLY WAKE--HAD NEEDED ONLY SLIGHTLY ELEVATING BY AN EXTRA QUANTITY OF GOOD ALE TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THE GENTRY WOULD BE VERY MUCH STRUCK WITH HIS PERFORMANCE OF HIS HORNPIPE
HE WAS FEELING MUCH MORE STRONGLY THAN HE HAD DONE IN THE MORNING
BUT SETH TELLS ME THERE'S NO HOPE O THAT
TRULY I HAVE BEEN TEMPTED SOMETIMES TO SAY THAT JACOB WAS OF A MEAN SPIRIT
YOU MUST NOT MARK ME
SHE CRIES TO ME THY WEAK CREATURE....SAVIOUR
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
YES
BUT THEN AS MISS IRWINE WAS OPPOSITE TO HIM INSTEAD OF THE OFFENSIVE LUKE HE MIGHT FREEZE THE WRONG PERSON
BARTLE MASSEY SAYS--AND HE KNOWS THE SOUTH--AS THE NORTHERN MEN ARE A FINER BREED THAN THE SOUTHERN HARDER-HEADED AND STRONGER-BODIED AND A DEAL TALLER
HETTY COULD NOT BE GOT TO GIVE ANY HEED TO THESE THINGS SO MOLLY WAS CALLED ON FOR HER READY SYMPATHY AND PEEPED WITH OPEN MOUTH WHEREVER SHE WAS TOLD AND SAID LAWKS WHENEVER SHE WAS EXPECTED TO WONDER
CRYING'S FOR THEM AS HA GOT NO HOME NOT FOR THEM AS WANT TO GET RID O ONE
BUT YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE FRIGGLING THINGS TAKE A DEAL O TIME
IT IS A PLEASANT THING ON SUCH A MORNING TO WALK ALONG THE WELL-ROLLED GRAVEL ON ONE'S WAY TO THE STABLES MEDITATING AN EXCURSION
SHE IS AT ANOTHER GATE NOW--THAT LEADING INTO FIR-TREE GROVE
INDEED YOU WILL NOT MISS ME
HAD ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO THE COACH A FORTNIGHT AGO
THAT WOULD NOT BE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR TO COME FOR SETH WOULD SCARCELY BE AT HOME MUCH BEFORE THEIR DINNER-TIME WHICH WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK
THAT'S THE TRUTH
AT SUCH A TIME AS THAT IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT IRWINE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING PRESSING TO SAY
SHE'S A PERFECT BEAUTY
AND AS FOR OTHER VEGETABLES THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE ROOM THAN WAS NECESSARY FOR THEM THAT IN THE ROTATION OF CROPS A LARGE FLOURISHING BED OF GROUNDSEL WAS OF YEARLY OCCURRENCE ON ONE SPOT OR OTHER
NO ONE WANTED HIM AND NO ONE WOULD NOTICE IF HE SLIPPED AWAY
I'LL TIE HIRS UP AN SHOE HIM AS I DO TH HOSSES
SHE DIDN'T LIKE OUR MARRIAGE WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT--THAT MUST BE IT
THERE'S NO RULES SO WISE BUT WHAT IT'S A PITY FOR SOMEBODY OR OTHER
ON WHICH GROUND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT THINK HIM UNMANLY ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN HAVE THOUGHT THE GALLANT COLONEL BATH UNMANLY WHEN HE MADE THE GRUEL FOR HIS INVALID SISTER
AYE
AYE
SAY YOU'LL LEAVE THE DOOR ALONE AND MAKE AN END ON'T I BINNA FRIGHTED AT ADAM SAID BEN BUT I DONNA MIND SAYIN AS I'LL LET T ALONE AT YOUR ASKIN SETH COME THAT'S WISE OF YOU BEN SAID ADAM LAUGHING AND RELAXING HIS GRASP
I WISH YOU GOOD-BYE SIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME YOU'VE SPARED ME
HE TAUGHT HER TO DECEIVE--HE DECEIVED ME FIRST
YES I'M AFRAID THE GRIEF CUTS VERY DEEP SAID MR IRWINE
AFTER A WHILE SHE WAS PERSUADED TO LET THE KITCHEN BE MADE TIDY
SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE EVENING LIGHT THAT LAY GENTLY IN THE GRASSY ALLEYS BETWEEN THE FERN AND MADE THE BEAUTY OF THEIR LIVING GREEN MORE VISIBLE THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE OVERPOWERING FLOOD OF NOON
SHE WOULD HAVE NO NAY BUT SHE WOULD GET UP AND BE DRESSED IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING I COULD SAY
I SUPPOSE IF I COULD LIVE ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS I SHOULD BE BLIND TO EVERYTHING THAT WASN'T OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S SIGHT LIKE A MAN WHO STANDS IN A WELL AND SEES NOTHING BUT THE STARS SEE SAID ARTHUR THE OLD WOMEN ARE READY TO SET OUT ON THEIR RACE NOW
HAVE THEY BEGUN YES MY BOY YES--IT'S TAKEN ALL THE TIME SINCE I FIRST WENT
BY THE BY WE ALL LIKED THAT NICE CREAM-CHEESE YOU SENT US--MY MOTHER ESPECIALLY I'M VERY GLAD INDEED SIR
YOU'RE GETTING TO BE YOUR AUNT'S OWN NIECE I SEE FOR PARTICULARNESS THEY BEGAN THEIR LITTLE TASK TOGETHER BUT DINAH HAD NOT RECOVERED HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO THINK OF ANY REMARK AND ADAM LOOKED AT HER UNEASILY
HE KNEW BUT TWO TYPES OF METHODIST--THE ECSTATIC AND THE BILIOUS
AUNT LYDIA MUST FEEL VERY DESOLATE POOR THING
THANK YOU FRIEND
I'VE NO RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MY BEING SORRY
MESTER IRWINE'S GOT MORE SENSE NOR TO MEDDLE WI PEOPLE'S DOING AS THEY LIKE IN RELIGION
HE COULD NO MORE BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD SO FALL IN HIS OWN ESTEEM THAN THAT HE SHOULD BREAK BOTH HIS LEGS AND GO ON CRUTCHES ALL THE REST OF HIS LIFE
DINAH FELT A DOUBLE CARE FOR HETTY BECAUSE SHE SHARED SETH'S ANXIOUS INTEREST IN HIS BROTHER'S LOT AND SHE HAD NOT COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HETTY DID NOT LOVE ADAM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
IS IT SOME DANGER OF YOUR OWN THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING IN THIS PHILOSOPHICAL GENERAL WAY IN ASKING THIS QUESTION MR IRWINE PUSHED HIS PLATE AWAY THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED STRAIGHT AT ARTHUR
IT'S A HOUSE I SELDOM GO INTO THOUGH I'M FOND OF THE BOYS AND MARTIN POYSER'S A GOOD FELLOW
I SPEAK OF THIS BECAUSE I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU THINK ME SLOW TO ANSWER OR THAT I HAD SMALL JOY IN YOUR REJOICING AT THE WORLDLY GOOD THAT HAS BEFALLEN YOUR BROTHER ADAM
MRS POYSER ON HER WAY PEEPED INTO THE ROOM WHERE HER TWO BOYS LAY
CARROLL LOOKED IN WHEN WE WERE SMOKING OUR PIPES O SATURDAY NIGHT AT CASSON'S AND HE TOLD US ABOUT IT
WELL I SAYS THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS WI BONY
IS SHE DEAD HE ASKED IN A LOW TONE WHEN ADAM RAISED HIS HEAD AND WAS RECOVERING HIMSELF
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING NOW HOWEVER--EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO-NIGHT AT LEAST
BUT I SHALL GET IT DONE SAID ADAM LOOKING UP AND CASTING ONE OF HIS BRIGHT KEEN GLANCES AT HIS BROTHER
I DON'T REMEMBER EVER BEING SEE-SAW IN THAT WAY WHEN I'D MADE MY MIND UP AS YOU SAY THAT A THING WAS WRONG
THAT HE WAS NOT INTOLERANT--AND THERE IS A RUMOUR THAT SOME ZEALOUS THEOLOGIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER FREE FROM THAT BLEMISH
IF I CHOSE TO INTERFERE IN THIS BUSINESS NOW I MIGHT GET UP AS PRETTY A STORY OF HATRED AND PERSECUTION AS THE METHODISTS NEED DESIRE TO PUBLISH IN THE NEXT NUMBER OF THEIR MAGAZINE
BETTER TAKE HIM ON THY ARM SETH SAID DINAH LOOKING FONDLY AT THE STOUT BLACK-EYED FELLOW
DON'T YOU TAKE NOTICE OF IT BECAUSE IT HURTS HIM WHEN YOU DO
AN SETH WHY DONNA YE GET HER SOME TAY
GOD ALMIGHTY MADE EM TO MATCH THE MEN MATCH SAID BARTLE
GOD PRESERVE YOU AND ME FROM BEING THE BEGINNERS OF SUCH MISERY
COME AN HA THY SUPPER COME LET BE SAID ADAM IMPETUOUSLY SHAKING HER OFF AND SEIZING ONE OF THE PLANKS THAT STOOD AGAINST THE WALL
PERHAPS THE REASON WAS THAT HE COULD NOT CONCEIVE HETTY'S THROWING HERSELF ON ARTHUR UNCALLED
ANYBODY UD THINK THE SCOTCH TUNES HAD ALWAYS BEEN ASKING A QUESTION OF SOMEBODY AS DEAF AS OLD TAFT AND HAD NEVER GOT AN ANSWER YET ADAM MINDED THE LESS ABOUT SITTING BY MR CASSON BECAUSE THIS POSITION ENABLED HIM TO SEE HETTY WHO WAS NOT FAR OFF HIM AT THE NEXT TABLE
BUT THERE'S MILLS NOW SITS I THE CHIMNEY-CORNER AND READS THE PAPER PRETTY NIGH FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND WHEN HE'S GOT TO TH END ON'T HE'S MORE ADDLE-HEADED THAN HE WAS AT THE BEGINNING
BEN WILL BE JOKING
IT HAS BEEN A VERY PRECIOUS TIME TO ME DINAH WENT ON LAST NIGHT AND TO-DAY--SEEING TWO SUCH GOOD SONS AS ADAM AND SETH BEDE
YE MIGHT SPARE ME A BIT O THIS GROGRAM TO MAKE CLOTHES FOR THE LAD--YE WAR NE'ER ILL-NATURED BESS
YOU'LL PERHAPS BE BETTER IN A MINUTE OR TWO NO SAID ARTHUR
SHE THOUGHT YOU'D PERHAPS LIKE TO GO OUT AND SPEAK TO HER
THE COLD VEAL THE FRESH LETTUCES AND THE STUFFED CHINE MIGHT WELL LOOK TEMPTING TO HUNGRY MEN WHO HAD DINED AT HALF-PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK
NOW HE WAS THERE--HE HAD TAKEN HER HAND--YES HE WAS PRESSING IT
THEIR SORROWS ARE HEALED AND I FEEL THAT I AM CALLED BACK TO MY OLD WORK IN WHICH I FOUND A BLESSING THAT I HAVE MISSED OF LATE IN THE MIDST OF TOO ABUNDANT WORLDLY GOOD
NO WONDER HE NEEDS A SUFFERING GOD
SHE'S MR POYSER'S OWN NIECE AN I DONNA WISH TO SAY WHAT'S ANYWAYS DISRESPECTFUL O TH FAMILY AT TH HALL FARM AS I'VE MEASURED FOR SHOES LITTLE AN BIG WELLY IVER SIN I'VE BEEN A SHOEMAKER
FOR LIKE ALL OLD MEN WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT IN LABOUR HE LIKED TO FEEL THAT HE WAS STILL USEFUL--THAT THERE WAS A BETTER CROP OF ONIONS IN THE GARDEN BECAUSE HE WAS BY AT THE SOWING--AND THAT THE COWS WOULD BE MILKED THE BETTER IF HE STAYED AT HOME ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON TO LOOK ON
BUT A SECOND COUSIN O MINE A DROVIER WAS A RARE HAND AT REMEMBERING THE SCOTCH TUNES
TILL THOU INWARD LIGHT IMPART GLAD MY EYES AND WARM MY HEART
YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT ME--YOU THINK I'M A COMMON MAN AS YOU CAN INJURE WITHOUT ANSWERING FOR IT I NEVER MEANT TO INJURE YOU SAID ARTHUR WITH RETURNING ANGER
IT MIGHT PUT NOTIONS INTO HER HEAD AS IRWINE HAD HINTED
FEW SUBLIMELY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
BUT ODDLY ENOUGH HE HAS FOUND THE PEOPLE UP THAT BACK STREET OF PRECISELY THE SAME STAMP AS THE INHABITANTS OF SHEPPERTON--"A POOR LOT SIR BIG AND LITTLE AND THEM AS COMES FOR A GO O GIN ARE NO BETTER THAN THEM AS COMES FOR A PINT O TWOPENNY--A POOR LOT CHAPTER XVIII CHURCH HETTY HETTY DON'T YOU KNOW CHURCH BEGINS AT TWO AND IT'S GONE HALF AFTER ONE A'READY
AND POYSER WAS NOT LIKELY TO KNOW IT
IT WAS THE EXAGGERATING EFFECT OF IMAGINATION THAT MADE HIS HEART STILL BEAT A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY AT THE THOUGHT OF HER
IT'S SUMMAT-LIKE TO SEE SUCH A MAN AS THAT I THE DESK OF A SUNDAY
AND ALL BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT NOTIONS I YOUR HEAD ABOUT RELIGION MORE NOR WHAT'S I THE CATECHISM AND THE PRAYER-BOOK BUT NOT MORE THAN WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE AUNT SAID DINAH
HIS EYES WOULD FIX THEMSELVES ON THE DISTANT BEND IN THE ROAD ROUND WHICH A LITTLE FIGURE MUST SURELY APPEAR BEFORE LONG
HE THREW UP THE WINDOWS HE RUSHED OUT OF DOORS INTO THE DECEMBER AIR AND GREETED EVERY ONE WHO SPOKE TO HIM WITH AN EAGER GAIETY AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NEWS OF A FRESH NELSON VICTORY
AN AFTERNOON IN WHICH DESTINY DISGUISES HER COLD AWFUL FACE BEHIND A HAZY RADIANT VEIL ENCLOSES US IN WARM DOWNY WINGS AND POISONS US WITH VIOLET-SCENTED BREATH
ADAM HAD COME THITHER ON HIS PONY INTENDING TO RIDE TO THE STABLES AND PUT UP HIS NAG ON HIS WAY HOME
PITY THAT CONSEQUENCES ARE DETERMINED NOT BY EXCUSES BUT BY ACTIONS WELL THE LETTER MUST BE WRITTEN
BUT IT PRESENTLY BROKE OUT AGAIN WITH RENEWED VIGOUR LET ALL THY CONVERSE BE SINCERE THY CONSCIENCE AS THE NOONDAY CLEAR
FOR MRS POYSER WAS STRICT IN ADHERENCE TO HER OWN RULES OF PROPRIETY AND SHE CONSIDERED THAT A YOUNG GIRL WAS NOT TO BE TREATED SHARPLY IN THE PRESENCE OF A RESPECTABLE MAN WHO WAS COURTING HER
SHE'S GOT NO CONSCIENCE--NO CONSCIENCE
AND MAY HIS DOINGS PROSPER WHATE'ER HE TAKES IN HAND FOR WE ARE ALL HIS SERVANTS AND ARE AT HIS COMMAND
SHE WALKS ON HAPPY WHENEVER SHE IS COMING TO A BEND IN THE ROAD FOR PERHAPS HE IS BEHIND IT
HE WANTED HER TO LOOK AT HIM AND BE AS PLEASED AS HE WAS HIMSELF WITH DOING THIS BIT OF PLAYFUL WORK
SHE WAS ONLY THINKING SHE COULD NEVER STAY HERE AND GO ON WITH THE OLD LIFE--SHE COULD BETTER BEAR SOMETHING QUITE NEW THAN SINKING BACK INTO THE OLD EVERYDAY ROUND
AND THEN HE WANTED TO SMOOTH IT OFF WI LIES
ADAM WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT ONLY BY SEEING BARTLE MASSEY'S FACE AS HE LOOKED OVER HIS SPECTACLES WHICH HE HAD SHIFTED TO THE RIDGE OF HIS NOSE NOT REQUIRING THEM FOR PRESENT PURPOSES
AH IT'S A GREAT THING IN A MAN'S LIFE TO BE ABLE TO STAND BY A NEIGHBOUR AND UPHOLD HIM IN SUCH TROUBLE AS THAT GOD BLESS HIM AND YOU TOO MR MASSEY SAID ADAM IN A LOW VOICE LAYING HIS HAND ON BARTLE'S ARM
EH DEAR EH DEAR IS THERE SUMMAT THE MATTER THE OLD WOMAN HAD SEEN THE GHASTLY LOOK OF FEAR IN ADAM'S FACE
IF JONATHAN BURGE AND A FEW OTHERS FELT LESS COMFORTABLE ON THE OCCASION THEY TRIED THEIR BEST TO LOOK CONTENTED AND SO THE TOAST WAS DRUNK WITH A GOODWILL APPARENTLY UNANIMOUS
BUT SHE GOT UP AND CALLED GYP THINKING TO CONSOLE HERSELF SOMEWHAT FOR ADAM'S REFUSAL OF THE SUPPER SHE HAD SPREAD OUT IN THE LOVING EXPECTATION OF LOOKING AT HIM WHILE HE ATE IT BY FEEDING ADAM'S DOG WITH EXTRA LIBERALITY
SHE PUTS THEM QUICKLY INTO THE BOX AGAIN AND SHUTS THEM UP
BUT HE WOKE UP VERY SPEEDILY FROM THAT DREAM THE WAKING WAS CHILL AND SAD FOR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY FOOLISH IN HIM TO BELIEVE HIS MOTHER'S WORDS--SHE COULD HAVE NO GROUND FOR THEM
IT WAS AS IF HIS HORSE HAD WHEELED ROUND FROM A LEAP AND DARED TO DISPUTE HIS MASTERY
ARTHUR WISHED IT TOO
BUT THIS RESOLUTION HAD BEEN AN IMMENSE EFFORT--HE TREMBLED AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING HER CHANGED FACE AS A TIMID WOMAN TREMBLES AT THE THOUGHT OF THE SURGEON'S KNIFE AND HE CHOSE NOW TO BEAR THE LONG HOURS OF SUSPENSE RATHER THAN ENCOUNTER WHAT SEEMED TO HIM THE MORE INTOLERABLE AGONY OF WITNESSING HER TRIAL
HE THOUGHT THE GENTRY MADE MORE FUSS ABOUT THIS YOUNG CARPENTER THAN WAS NECESSARY
WHY YOU AND ME DEAR FRIENDS ARE POOR
THEN THE INWARD LIGHT SHINES THE BRIGHTER AND WE HAVE A DEEPER SENSE OF RESTING ON THE DIVINE STRENGTH
BUT MEG WAS QUITE AS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HER MASTER'S MENTAL STATE AS MANY OTHERS OF HER SEX WITH THE MENTAL CONDITION OF THE NICE YOUNG GENTLEMEN TOWARDS WHOM THEIR HEARTS ARE IN A STATE OF FLUTTERING EXPECTATION
SHE SAID BY AND BY SHE WOULD WRITE HERSELF BUT NOT TO-DAY
AT OAKBOURNE THE OSTLER AT THE ROYAL OAK REMEMBERED SUCH A YOUNG WOMAN AS ADAM DESCRIBED GETTING OUT OF THE TREDDLESTON COACH MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT AGO--WASN'T LIKELY TO FORGET SUCH A PRETTY LASS AS THAT IN A HURRY--WAS SURE SHE HAD NOT GONE ON BY THE BUXTON COACH THAT WENT THROUGH SNOWFIELD BUT HAD LOST SIGHT OF HER WHILE HE WENT AWAY WITH THE HORSES AND HAD NEVER SET EYES ON HER AGAIN
I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME AND I WAS TH HAPPIEST MAN I THE PARISH
FOR ADAM THOUGH YOU SEE HIM QUITE MASTER OF HIMSELF WORKING HARD AND DELIGHTING IN HIS WORK AFTER HIS INBORN INALIENABLE NATURE HAD NOT OUTLIVED HIS SORROW--HAD NOT FELT IT SLIP FROM HIM AS A TEMPORARY BURDEN AND LEAVE HIM THE SAME MAN AGAIN
SO YOU SEE DEAR FRIENDS SHE WENT ON JESUS SPENT HIS TIME ALMOST ALL IN DOING GOOD TO POOR PEOPLE
BACHELORS DOESN'T WANT SUCH HEAVY EARNIN'S
THEE'T HARDLY ATIN A BIT O SUPPER
CHAPTER XXXIV THE BETROTHAL IT WAS A DRY SUNDAY AND REALLY A PLEASANT DAY FOR THE 2D OF NOVEMBER
WHY MR BURGE HAS OFFERED ME A SHARE IN HIS BUSINESS AND I'M GOING TO TAKE IT THERE WAS A CHANGE IN HETTY'S FACE CERTAINLY NOT PRODUCED BY ANY AGREEABLE IMPRESSION FROM THIS NEWS
HOWEVER TOMORROW AFTER CHURCH HE WOULD GO TO THE HALL FARM AND TELL THEM THE NEWS
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS TO TELL YOU
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL MARRY AT ALL EH SAID LISBETH IMPATIENTLY
WHY YE'RE BROTHER TO THE YOUNG MAN AS COME AFORE ARENA YE YES SAID ADAM ENTERING
THESE WERE ARTHUR'S CHIEF THOUGHTS SO FAR AS A MAN'S THOUGHTS THROUGH HOURS OF TRAVELLING CAN BE COMPRESSED INTO A FEW SENTENCES WHICH ARE ONLY LIKE THE LIST OF NAMES TELLING YOU WHAT ARE THE SCENES IN A LONG LONG PANORAMA FULL OF COLOUR OF DETAIL AND OF LIFE
AND WE TALKED A DEAL ABOUT THEE FOR HE SAYS HE NEVER SAW A WOMAN A BIT LIKE THEE
BUT NOW NECESSITY WAS PRESSING HARD UPON HER--NOW THE TIME OF HER MARRIAGE WAS CLOSE AT HAND--SHE COULD NO LONGER REST IN THIS BLIND TRUST
THE LOVELY FACE AND FORM AFFECTED HER AS BEAUTY ALWAYS AFFECTS A PURE AND TENDER MIND FREE FROM SELFISH JEALOUSIES
BUT THAT MARVELLOUS FACILITY WHICH WE MISTOOK FOR GENIUS IS APT TO FORSAKE US WHEN WE WANT TO DRAW A REAL UNEXAGGERATED LION
BUT IT UD HA GONE NEAR TO SPOIL MY WORK FOR ME IF I'D SEEN HER BROUGHT TO SORROW AND SHAME AND THROUGH THE MAN AS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROUD TO THINK ON
AND A SMALL RED-LEATHER CASE FASTENING WITH A STRAP
HE ONLY FELT A SORT OF AMUSED PITY AS IF HE HAD SEEN A KITTEN SETTING UP ITS BACK OR A LITTLE BIRD WITH ITS FEATHERS RUFFLED
IF IT WAR SUMMAT I DIDNA WANT IT UD BE DONE FAST ENOUGH LISBETH ROSE FROM THE BENCH AT THIS AND WENT OUT OF THE WORKSHOP LEAVING SETH IN MUCH ANXIETY LEST SHE SHOULD DISTURB ADAM'S MIND ABOUT DINAH
I KNOW THEY'D PERSUADE ME OVER A DEAL SOONER NOR TH UGLY MEN
MR CRAIG WAS NOT ABOVE TALKING POLITICS OCCASIONALLY THOUGH HE PIQUED HIMSELF RATHER ON A WISE INSIGHT THAN ON SPECIFIC INFORMATION
WE'N NO NEED TO SAY WHY THE MATCH IS BROKE OFF AN WE MAY HEAR OF HER AFTER A BIT
HER HEAD WITH ITS DARK RINGS OF HAIR LAY BACK LANGUIDLY ON THE PILLOW AND THE SADNESS THAT RESTED ABOUT HER BROW AND EYES WAS SOMETHING TOO HARD FOR REGRETFUL MEMORY
THEY HAD HARDLY EVERY BEEN SEPARATED FOR MORE THAN A DAY SINCE THEY WERE BORN
BUT I DARESAY YE WARNA FRANZY FOR YE LOOK AS IF YE'D NE'ER BEEN ANGERED I YOUR LIFE
BUT TAKE CARE YOU GET A CHARMING BRIDE ELSE I WOULD RATHER DIE WITHOUT SEEING HER YOU'RE SO TERRIBLY FASTIDIOUS GODMOTHER SAID ARTHUR I'M AFRAID I SHOULD NEVER SATISFY YOU WITH MY CHOICE WELL I WON'T FORGIVE YOU IF SHE'S NOT HANDSOME
AND HETTY ARE YOU MAD
AND THE GROWN-UP PEOPLE TOO WERE IN GOOD SPIRITS INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN YET FINER DAYS WHEN THE WIND HAD FALLEN
BUT FOLKS AS HAVE NO MIND TO BE O USE HAVE ALLAYS THE LUCK TO BE OUT O THE ROAD WHEN THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE DONE I DID SET OUT BEFORE EIGHT AUNT SAID HETTY IN A PETTISH TONE WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HER HEAD
SHE IS MY SOUL'S BRIGHT MORNING-STAR AND SHE MY RISING SUN
BUT I'LL PUT A STOP TO IT PRETTY QUICK THEE'DST BE SORRY TO PART WI HER IF IT WASN'T FOR HER GOOD SAID MR POYSER
THESE THOUGHTS ABOUT ARTHUR LIKE ALL THOUGHTS THAT ARE CHARGED WITH STRONG FEELING WERE CONTINUALLY RECURRING AND THEY ALWAYS CALLED UP THE IMAGE OF THE GROVE--OF THAT SPOT UNDER THE OVERARCHING BOUGHS WHERE HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TWO BENDING FIGURES AND HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY SUDDEN RAGE
WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE SELF-MASTERY ENOUGH TO BE ALWAYS AS HARMLESS AND PURELY BENEFICENT AS HIS GOOD-NATURE LED HIM TO DESIRE WAS A QUESTION THAT NO ONE HAD YET DECIDED AGAINST HIM
SHE COULD NOT PREVAIL ON HERSELF TO SAY I WILL GO TO DINAH
AN THERE'S A FINE BATCH O METHODISSES AT TREDDLES'ON--THAT'S THE MARKET TOWN ABOUT THREE MILE OFF--YOU'LL MAYBE HA COME THROUGH IT SIR
IT'S WONDERFUL WHAT SIGHT HE HAS AND HIM TURNED SEVENTY-FIVE AH I OFTEN THINK IT'S WI TH OLD FOLKS AS IT IS WI THE BABBIES SAID MRS POYSER
MR IRWINE WAS AT HOME THEN
FOR YOU--AND YOU TURN YOUR BACKS ON HIM
I COME TO YOU SIR HE SAID AS THE GENTLEMAN I LOOK UP TO MOST OF ANYBODY
IT IS PLEASED WITH ASSURANCES THAT IT ALL THE WHILE DISBELIEVES
AND WE SHALL P'RHAPS ALL BE GONE TWENTY MILE FARTHER OFF HER NEXT MICHAELMAS AND SHALL DIE O BROKEN HEARTS AMONG STRANGE FOLKS AND LEAVE THE CHILDREN FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS NAY NAY SAID MR POYSER WHO CERTAINLY HAD THE AIR OF A MAN PERFECTLY HEART-WHOLE IT ISNA SO BAD AS THAT
ON LEAVING LISBETH MR IRWINE HAD GONE TO JONATHAN BURGE WHO HAD ALSO A CLAIM TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH WHAT WAS LIKELY TO KEEP ADAM AWAY FROM BUSINESS FOR SOME TIME
THY SONS ULL NEVER GET ANOTHER MOTHER THAT'S TRUE LAD THAT'S TRUE SAID MR POYSER
IT WAS AFFECTION FOR THE DEAD
IT'S NIGH UPON SEVEN NOW AYE THEY'D HAVE A DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER SAID SETH AND THE MEETING UD TOUCH EM BOTH PRETTY CLOSISH
I THOUGHT SHE'D HA NO SPERRIT FOR TH HARVEST SUPPER MRS POYSER HAD THOUGHT OF DINAH SEVERAL TIMES SINCE ADAM HAD COME IN BUT SHE HAD HAD NO HEART TO MENTION THE BAD NEWS
I HAVE SEEN YOU BEFORE HE SAID AT LAST
BUT WHEN HE SAW ARTHUR COLOUR HE WENT ON RELENTINGLY MY PART YOU KNOW IS ALWAYS THAT OF THE OLD FOGY WHO SEES NOTHING TO ADMIRE IN THE YOUNG FOLKS
HE TOLD US AS GOSPEL MEANT GOOD NEWS THE GOSPEL YOU KNOW IS WHAT THE BIBLE TELLS US ABOUT GOD
THIS GENTLE EXPRESSION WAS THE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE THE SCHOOLMASTER'S NOSE AN IRREGULAR AQUILINE TWISTED A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE HAD RATHER A FORMIDABLE CHARACTER
SO I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
THE JUDGE SPOKE HESTER SORREL THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HETTY'S FACE AND THEN FLED BACK AGAIN AS SHE LOOKED UP AT THE JUDGE AND KEPT HER WIDE-OPEN EYES FIXED ON HIM AS IF FASCINATED BY FEAR
THE ANTHEM WENT LIMPING WITHOUT YOU
I FIND A SOURCE OF DELICIOUS SYMPATHY IN THESE FAITHFUL PICTURES OF A MONOTONOUS HOMELY EXISTENCE WHICH HAS BEEN THE FATE OF SO MANY MORE AMONG MY FELLOW-MORTALS THAN A LIFE OF POMP OR OF ABSOLUTE INDIGENCE OF TRAGIC SUFFERING OR OF WORLD-STIRRING ACTIONS
AND I'VE GOT CASSON AND ADAM BEDE AND SOME OTHER GOOD FELLOWS TO LOOK TO THE GIVING OUT OF ALE IN THE BOOTHS AND TO TAKE CARE THINGS DON'T GO TOO FAR
HAVE I FELT THY TROUBLE SO LITTLE THAT I SHOULDNA FEEL THY JOY THERE WAS SILENCE A FEW MOMENTS AS THEY WALKED ON AND THEN SETH SAID I'D NO NOTION AS THEE'DST EVER THINK OF HER FOR A WIFE BUT IS IT O ANY USE TO THINK OF HER SAID ADAM
SO SHE TURNED WITHOUT SPEAKING AND JOINED THE GROUP OUTSIDE THE HOUSE DOOR FOLLOWED BY HETTY WHOSE HEART WAS FLUTTERING SO AT THE THOUGHT OF SOME ONE SHE EXPECTED TO SEE AT CHURCH THAT SHE HARDLY FELT THE GROUND SHE TROD ON
BUT WHEN ARTHUR HUNG THE BASKET OVER HER ARM AGAIN THE POOR CHILD FELT A STRANGE DIFFERENCE IN HIS LOOK AND MANNER
THERE'S A CLEAN CAP I THAT DRAWER AN I'LL GO I THE BACK KITCHEN AN WASH MY FACE
I MAY COME AND SEE HER TO-MORROW MAYN'T I HE SAID
OF HER FOREBODING WORDS WHICH HAD MADE HER ANGRY
EH POOR MON HE TAKES IT QUIET ENOUGH
SHE HARDLY KNOWS THAT THE SUN IS SHINING
GOD'S LOVE AND MERCY CAN OVERCOME ALL THINGS--OUR IGNORANCE AND WEAKNESS AND ALL THE BURDEN OF OUR PAST WICKEDNESS--ALL THINGS BUT OUR WILFUL SIN SIN THAT WE CLING TO AND WILL NOT GIVE UP
I CARENA IF I NE'ER ATE NOR DRINK NO MORE
ANSWER ME THAT TO BE SURE Y ARE CRAIG SAYS HE--HE'S NOT A BAD FELLOW MILLS ISN'T FOR A BUTLER BUT WEAK I THE HEAD
HE WAS SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS AND THEN SAID AS INDIFFERENTLY AS HE COULD I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY CLEARING UP ADAM
THERE WAS NO CANDLE BUT THERE WAS LIGHT IN THE HOVEL--THE LIGHT OF EARLY MORNING THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
TO ARTHUR IT WAS NOTHING SURPRISING THAT THE SERVANTS LOOKED GRAVE AND SAD
THE SQUIRE'S CUTE ENOUGH BUT IT TAKES SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES CUTENESS TO MAKE FOLKS SEE WHAT'LL BE THEIR INTEREST IN THE LONG RUN
HOW COULD YOU LET EM DO SO HETTY
MY POOR HETTY...SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN...THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE--SMILING UP AT ME...I THOUGHT SHE LOVED ME...AND WAS GOOD ADAM'S VOICE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY SINKING INTO A HOARSE UNDERTONE AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF
PERHAPS TOO HE IS ANGRY WITH US
AND JUST LOCK THE OUTER DOOR NOW YOU'RE NEAR IT SAID BARTLE GETTING HIS STICK IN THE FITTING ANGLE TO HELP HIM IN DESCENDING FROM HIS STOOL
ONE OF THOSE NEIGHBOURS WHO CAME TO MARTIN POYSER AND SHOOK HIM BY THE HAND WITHOUT SPEAKING FOR SOME MINUTES WAS BARTLE MASSEY
THAT IS A HARD AND DREARY THING EVEN TO THE RICH THE STRONG THE INSTRUCTED
AN YE FEATURE HIM ON'Y YE'RE DARKER
AND THOUGH HE GLANCED AT LISBETH WHEN SHE CALLED HIM AND MOVED HIS FORE-PAWS UNEASILY WELL KNOWING THAT SHE WAS INVITING HIM TO SUPPER HE WAS IN A DIVIDED STATE OF MIND AND REMAINED SEATED ON HIS HAUNCHES AGAIN FIXING HIS EYES ANXIOUSLY ON HIS MASTER
BUT IT IS NOT IN HUMAN NATURE--ONLY IN HUMAN PRETENCE--FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE ARTHUR WITH A FINE CONSTITUTION AND FINE SPIRITS THINKING WELL OF HIMSELF BELIEVING THAT OTHERS THINK WELL OF HIM AND HAVING A VERY ARDENT INTENTION TO GIVE THEM MORE AND MORE REASON FOR THAT GOOD OPINION--IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR SUCH A YOUNG MAN JUST COMING INTO A SPLENDID ESTATE THROUGH THE DEATH OF A VERY OLD MAN WHOM HE WAS NOT FOND OF TO FEEL ANYTHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM EXULTANT JOY
HIS LOVE IS WITHOUT END ITS STREAMS THE WHOLE CREATION REACH SO PLENTEOUS IS THE STORE
TO BE SURE ADAM WAS DECEIVED--DECEIVED IN A WAY THAT ARTHUR WOULD HAVE RESENTED AS A DEEP WRONG IF IT HAD BEEN PRACTISED ON HIMSELF
SETH WHO WAS EASILY TOUCHED SHED TEARS AND TRIED TO RECALL AS HE HAD DONE CONTINUALLY SINCE HIS FATHER'S DEATH ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT A SINGLE MOMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE LAST MIGHT BE A MOMENT OF PARDON AND RECONCILEMENT
AN YE DONNA SET UP YOUR BRISTLES AT EVERY BIT O FUN LIKE SOME O YOUR KIN AS IS MAYHAP CLIVERER SETH LAD SAID ADAM TAKING NO NOTICE OF THE SARCASM AGAINST HIMSELF THEE MUSTNA TAKE ME UNKIND
HE HAD INTENDED TO GO RIGHT ON HIS WAY FROM THE HALL FARM BUT NOW THE IMPULSE WHICH HAD FREQUENTLY VISITED HIM BEFORE--TO GO TO MR IRWINE AND MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM--RECURRED WITH THE NEW FORCE WHICH BELONGS TO A LAST OPPORTUNITY
THE EYES THAT SHED THOSE GLANCES WERE REALLY NOT HALF SO FINE AS ADAM'S WHICH SOMETIMES LOOKED AT HER WITH A SAD BESEECHING TENDERNESS BUT THEY HAD FOUND A READY MEDIUM IN HETTY'S LITTLE SILLY IMAGINATION WHEREAS ADAM'S COULD GET NO ENTRANCE THROUGH THAT ATMOSPHERE
THERE ARE VARIOUS ORDERS OF BEAUTY CAUSING MEN TO MAKE FOOLS OF THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS STYLES FROM THE DESPERATE TO THE SHEEPISH
I'LL BACK YOU FOR AN EYE AT MEASURING AND A HEAD-PIECE FOR FIGURES AGAINST ANY MAN IN THIS COUNTY AND YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING--YOU'VE HAD GOOD TEACHING WHEN THEY GOT UPSTAIRS THE QUESTION WHICH ARTHUR HAD LEFT UNSETTLED AS TO WHO WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND WHO VICE WAS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION SO THAT ADAM'S ENTRANCE PASSED WITHOUT REMARK
IT LL OLD HUP FOR THE BARLEY THIS MORNING I THINK
SHE TOLD ME SHE SHOULD COME BACK TO THE PEOPLE AT THE HALL FARM AND YOU WILL PERSUADE THE POYSERS TO STAY ADAM SAID ARTHUR REMINDED OF THE SUBJECT WHICH BOTH OF THEM HAD FORGOTTEN IN THE FIRST INTERCHANGE OF REVIVED FRIENDSHIP
I'VE KNOWN WHAT IT IS IN MY LIFE TO REPENT AND FEEL IT'S TOO LATE
BUT HETTY WAS PREPARED FOR THE MEETING
WHY IT SAYS AS GOD PUT HIS SPERRIT INTO THE WORKMAN AS BUILT THE TABERNACLE TO MAKE HIM DO ALL THE CARVED WORK AND THINGS AS WANTED A NICE HAND
HE WAS TOO AGITATED TO SEE MORE--EVEN TO SEE THAT MR IRWINE'S FACE WAS ONE OF THEM
YES THERE WAS ONE THING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER
I'LL NOT DENY BUT HE MAY BE A BIT CLIVER--HE'S NO FRENCHMAN BORN AS I UNDERSTAND--BUT WHAT'S HE GOT AT'S BACK BUT MOUNSEERS MR CRAIG PAUSED A MOMENT WITH AN EMPHATIC STARE AFTER THIS TRIUMPHANT SPECIMEN OF SOCRATIC ARGUMENT AND THEN ADDED THUMPING THE TABLE RATHER FIERCELY WHY IT'S A SURE THING--AND THERE'S THEM ULL BEAR WITNESS TO'T--AS I ONE REGIMENT WHERE THERE WAS ONE MAN A-MISSING THEY PUT THE REGIMENTALS ON A BIG MONKEY AND THEY FIT HIM AS THE SHELL FITS THE WALNUT AND YOU COULDN'T TELL THE MONKEY FROM THE MOUNSEERS AH
AND IN THE CONFLICTING EMOTIONS THAT FILLED THOSE LONG MOMENTS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT GIVE LOOSE TO PASSION HE WOULD ONLY SPEAK THE RIGHT THING
THAT HAT MADE THE DROP OF BITTERNESS IN HETTY'S CUP TO-DAY FOR IT WAS NOT QUITE NEW--EVERYBODY WOULD SEE THAT IT WAS A LITTLE TANNED AGAINST THE WHITE RIBBON--AND MARY BURGE SHE FELT SURE WOULD HAVE A NEW HAT OR BONNET ON
AND NO SOONER DO YOU GET YOUR CAPS ON AND TURN OUT OF DOORS AGAIN THAN YOU SWEEP THE WHOLE THING CLEAN OUT OF YOUR MIND
HE HAD NOT LONG ENTERED THE GROVE AND NOW HE PAUSED BEFORE A BEECH
THERE IS A TERRIBLE COERCION IN OUR DEEDS WHICH MAY FIRST TURN THE HONEST MAN INTO A DECEIVER AND THEN RECONCILE HIM TO THE CHANGE FOR THIS REASON--THAT THE SECOND WRONG PRESENTS ITSELF TO HIM IN THE GUISE OF THE ONLY PRACTICABLE RIGHT
MRS POYSER ADVANCED TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM CURTSYING LOW AND TREMBLING BETWEEN ANGER WITH DINAH AND ANXIETY TO CONDUCT HERSELF WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY ON THE OCCASION
AND EVEN IF HOOPS AND POWDER HAD BEEN IN FASHION HE WOULD VERY LIKELY NOT HAVE BEEN SENSIBLE JUST THEN THAT HETTY WANTED THOSE SIGNS OF HIGH BREEDING
IF HE COULD BUT BE ALWAYS NEAR HER INSTEAD OF LIVING SO FAR OFF
I THOUGHT THAT MAN IN THE SMOCK-FROCK UD SEE ME AND KNOW I PUT THE BABY THERE
A MAN CAN NEVER DO ANYTHING AT VARIANCE WITH HIS OWN NATURE
IT'S NEARLY TWO
AND IF HE'D NEVER COME NEAR HER AND I'D MARRIED HER AND BEEN LOVING TO HER AND TOOK CARE OF HER SHE MIGHT NEVER HA DONE ANYTHING BAD
I SUPPOSE HE'LL WANT A SON-IN-LAW WHO CAN TAKE TO IT
SEE SHE SAID THEY'RE TAKING THEIR PLACES TO DANCE
IT IS WELL KNOWN TO EVERY ONE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT THERE IS NO MAN WHOSE WORD CAN BE MORE DEPENDED ON THAN HIS
ARTHUR TURNED ROUND AND WALKED BY HETTY'S SIDE WITHOUT GIVING A REASON
DINAH WAS A RIDDLE TO HER
FOR HE HAD AN EASY JOLLY CONSCIENCE BROAD-BACKED LIKE HIMSELF AND ABLE TO CARRY A GREAT DEAL OF BEER OR PORT-WINE NOT BEING MADE SQUEAMISH BY DOUBTS AND QUALMS AND LOFTY ASPIRATIONS
MY GRANDFATHER IS ALWAYS A FEW DEGREES COLDER AT BREAKFAST THAN AT ANY OTHER HOUR IN THE DAY
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME AS SHE LAY DOWN TO-NIGHT IN THE STRANGE HARD BED SHE FELT THAT HER HOME HAD BEEN A HAPPY ONE THAT HER UNCLE HAD BEEN VERY GOOD TO HER THAT HER QUIET LOT AT HAYSLOPE AMONG THE THINGS AND PEOPLE SHE KNEW WITH HER LITTLE PRIDE IN HER ONE BEST GOWN AND BONNET AND NOTHING TO HIDE FROM ANY ONE WAS WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO WAKE UP TO AS A REALITY AND FIND THAT ALL THE FEVERISH LIFE SHE HAD KNOWN BESIDES WAS A SHORT NIGHTMARE
BUT THERE IS A STILL OLDER FRIEND OF MINE THAN ADAM BEDE PRESENT AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT IS MR IRWINE
NEVERTHELESS MR POYSER HAD A JOKE AGAINST HIM AFTER THE WEDDING DINNER TO THE EFFECT THAT IN THE VESTRY HE HAD GIVEN THE BRIDE ONE MORE KISS THAN WAS NECESSARY
WILL BAKER'S LAD COMES TO HELP ME IN A MORNING AND WE GET AS MUCH CLEANING DONE IN ONE HOUR WITHOUT ANY FUSS AS A WOMAN UD GET DONE IN THREE AND ALL THE WHILE BE SENDING BUCKETS O WATER AFTER YOUR ANKLES AND LET THE FENDER AND THE FIRE-IRONS STAND IN THE MIDDLE O THE FLOOR HALF THE DAY FOR YOU TO BREAK YOUR SHINS AGAINST EM
I FOUND IT OUT ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE HE WENT AWAY--FOUND HIM A-KISSING HER AS THEY WERE PARTING IN THE GROVE
WHY THEE'ST NEVER BEEN TO THE SCHOOL THEN SCHOOL
WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO INTO THE PRISON I WANT TO GO TO HETTY SORREL THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH--AND TO STAY WITH HER IF I MAY BE PERMITTED
YOU CAN ENJOY YOURSEN TO-DAY FOR-ALL YOU'RE NINETY AN BETTER YOUR SARVANT MESTERS YOUR SARVANT SAID FEYTHER TAFT IN A TREBLE TONE PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS IN COMPANY
THAT ALTHOUGH HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DECLINED TO GIVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED IN ANY PUBLIC CAUSE AND WAS FAR FROM BESTOWING ALL HIS GOODS TO FEED THE POOR HE HAD THAT CHARITY WHICH HAS SOMETIMES BEEN LACKING TO VERY ILLUSTRIOUS VIRTUE--HE WAS TENDER TO OTHER MEN'S FAILINGS AND UNWILLING TO IMPUTE EVIL
IT WAS A STILL AFTERNOON--THE GOLDEN LIGHT WAS LINGERING LANGUIDLY AMONG THE UPPER BOUGHS ONLY GLANCING DOWN HERE AND THERE ON THE PURPLE PATHWAY AND ITS EDGE OF FAINTLY SPRINKLED MOSS
AND THE BEST O WORKING IS IT GIVES YOU A GRIP HOLD O THINGS OUTSIDE YOUR OWN LOT AS HE DASHED THE COLD WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE HE FELT COMPLETELY HIMSELF AGAIN AND WITH HIS BLACK EYES AS KEEN AS EVER AND HIS THICK BLACK HAIR ALL GLISTENING WITH THE FRESH MOISTURE HE WENT INTO THE WORKSHOP TO LOOK OUT THE WOOD FOR HIS FATHER'S COFFIN INTENDING THAT HE AND SETH SHOULD CARRY IT WITH THEM TO JONATHAN BURGE'S AND HAVE THE COFFIN MADE BY ONE OF THE WORKMEN THERE SO THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT NOT SEE AND HEAR THE SAD TASK GOING FORWARD AT HOME
BUT IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS HARD FOR HIM TO WRITE IT
MOLLY I NIVER KNEW YOUR EQUILS--TO THINK O YOUR POOR MOTHER AS IS A WIDOW AN I TOOK YOU WI AS GOOD AS NO CHARACTER AN THE TIMES AN TIMES I'VE TOLD YOU MOLLY HAD NOT SEEN THE LIGHTNING AND THE THUNDER SHOOK HER NERVES THE MORE FOR THE WANT OF THAT PREPARATION
OUR FRIENDS THE CALVES ARE BLEATING FROM THE HOME CROFT
WE'VE NO RIGHT T INTERFERE WITH HER DOING AS SHE LIKES
I CAME TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM YEARS AFTER BUT I WAS A FOOLISH THOUGHTLESS CHILD THEN AND I REMEMBERED ONLY ONE THING HE TOLD US IN HIS SERMON
IT WAS THAT SORT OF PATHETIC EMOTION WHICH HAS MORE PLEASURE THAN PAIN IN IT--WHICH IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST DELICIOUS OF ALL STATES TO A GOOD-NATURED MAN CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER TO SATISFY HIS GOOD NATURE
THE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY HAD BEEN GOOD TO HER
HE SAW THE WHOLE HISTORY NOW BY THAT TERRIBLE ILLUMINATION WHICH THE PRESENT SHEDS BACK UPON THE PAST
YOU'LL FIND IT EASY NO THANK YOU I NEVER SIT IN EASY-CHAIRS SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SEATING HIMSELF ON A SMALL CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR
I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN
THE JAIL CHAPLAIN IS RATHER HARSH IN HIS MANNER BUT IT'S O NO USE IF SHE DOESN'T COME SAID ADAM SADLY
THE REASON IS--THOUGH SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT--THAT THERE'S SO MUCH TENDERNESS REFINEMENT AND PURITY ABOUT HER
AND THOU ART NEAR TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN THEE
I'VE ALWAYS DONE A DEAL AT SUCH LITTLE THINGS IN ODD HOURS AND THEY'RE PROFITABLE FOR THERE'S MORE WORKMANSHIP NOR MATERIAL IN EM
HE'D HEV A DEAL HAIMABLER GROOM NOR WHAT HE HAS NOW OBSERVED DALTON--AND THE JOKE APPEARED TO HIM SO GOOD THAT BEING LEFT ALONE UPON THE SCENE HE CONTINUED AT INTERVALS TO TAKE HIS PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH IN ORDER TO WINK AT AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE AND SHAKE LUXURIOUSLY WITH A SILENT VENTRAL LAUGHTER MENTALLY REHEARSING THE DIALOGUE FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HE MIGHT RECITE IT WITH EFFECT IN THE SERVANTS HALL
THE BEECH STOOD AT THE LAST TURNING BEFORE THE GROVE ENDED IN AN ARCHWAY OF BOUGHS THAT LET IN THE EASTERN LIGHT
IT IS SUBLIME--THAT SUDDEN PAUSE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE WHICH TELLS THAT ONE SOUL MOVES IN THEM ALL
OH IT WAS A BIT O NONSENSE
IT WAS ALL IRWINE'S FAULT
WHAT SHOULD THOSE DELICATE PEARLS AND CRYSTALS BE MADE FOR IF NOT FOR SUCH EARS
WHY WHAT DO YOU WANT AT THIS HOUSE HE SAID
AND DON'T YOU THINK YOU WOULD SUFFER MORE IF YOU'D BEEN IN FAULT THERE WAS SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES FOR THE STRUGGLE IN ADAM'S MIND WAS NOT EASILY DECIDED
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF
BUT AFTER LISBETH HAD BEEN ROCKING HERSELF AND MOANING FOR SOME MINUTES SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED AND SAID ALOUD TO HERSELF I'LL GO AN SEE ARTER ADAM FOR I CANNA THINK WHERE HE'S GOTTEN
YES INDEED
HER FATHER CHAD FRIGHTENED LEST HE SHOULD BE LAID HOLD ON TOO THIS IMPRESSION ON THE REBELLIOUS BESS STRIKING HIM AS NOTHING LESS THAN A MIRACLE WALKED HASTILY AWAY AND BEGAN TO WORK AT HIS ANVIL BY WAY OF REASSURING HIMSELF
FOR THEM METHODISSES MAKE FOLKS BELIEVE AS IF THEY TAKE A MUG O DRINK EXTRY AN MAKE THEIRSELVES A BIT COMFORTABLE THEY'LL HAVE TO GO TO HELL FOR'T AS SURE AS THEY'RE BORN
WHAT IF YOU MEANT NOTHING BY YOUR KISSING AND YOUR PRESENTS
HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PRESS HIS FATHER'S HAND BEFORE THEIR PARTING AND SAY FATHER YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL RIGHT BETWEEN US
HE'D NEVER HEARD ABOUT POOR HETTY TILL MR IRWINE MET HIM IN LONDON FOR THE LETTERS MISSED HIM ON HIS JOURNEY
BUT IT'S GETTING LATE NOW--IT'LL BE PRETTY NEAR ELEVEN BEFORE I'M AT HOME AND MOTHER MAY HAPPEN TO LIE AWAKE
I KNOW IT IS A VAIN THOUGHT TO FLEE FROM THE WORK THAT GOD APPOINTS US FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING A GREATER BLESSING TO OUR OWN SOULS AS IF WE COULD CHOOSE FOR OURSELVES WHERE WE SHALL FIND THE FULNESS OF THE DIVINE PRESENCE INSTEAD OF SEEKING IT WHERE ALONE IT IS TO BE FOUND IN LOVING OBEDIENCE
MY GOD MY GOD HE CRIES WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME ALL THIS HE BORE FOR YOU
HETTY...DINAH IS COME TO YOU AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE HETTY LIFTED HER HEAD SLOWLY AND TIMIDLY FROM HER KNEES AND RAISED HER EYES
WHEREUPON A TITTERING EXPLOSION FROM MARTY AND TOMMY AND A SERIOUS ELLO FROM MR POYSER WHO SAW HIS DRAUGHT OF ALE UNPLEASANTLY DEFERRED
SHE'S PUTTING TOTTY TO BED AND I WANT HER TO DRAW TH ALE FOR NANCY'S BUSY YET I THE DAIRY
IT TOUCHED DINAH KEENLY TO SAY THE LAST GOOD-BYE AND STILL MORE TO LOOK ROUND ON HER WAY ACROSS THE FIELDS AND SEE THE OLD WOMAN STILL STANDING AT THE DOOR GAZING AFTER HER TILL SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THE FAINTEST SPECK IN THE DIM AGED EYES
GONE ARTER SOME O'S CHAPELLIN I RECKON AYE AYE SETH'S AT NO HARM MOTHER THEE MAYST BE SURE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME O THEM FELLOWS AS MAKE THE ALMANECKS LOOKING AS FAR BEFORE THEIR NOSES AS I'VE GOT TO DO EVERY YEAR AS COMES THEY LOOK PRETTY FUR THOUGH SAID MR POYSER TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND SPEAKING IN RATHER A SUBDUED REVERENTIAL TONE
AND HE WANTED TO BE LIKE MY LORD JUDGE I THE PARISH PUNISHING FOLKS FOR DOING WRONG
IT'S FINE TALKING
IT UD BE ALL VERY WELL FOR ADAM BEDE TO ACT UNDER HIM BUT IT ISN'T TO BE SUPPOSED THE SQUIRE UD APPOINT A YOUNG FELLOW LIKE ADAM WHEN THERE'S HIS ELDERS AND BETTERS AT HAND BUT I SAID THAT'S A PRETTY NOTION O YOURS CASSON
AND THEN WE WENT LOOKING AFTER THE YOUNG WOMAN TILL DARK AT NIGHT AND WE WENT AND GAVE INFORMATION AT STONITON AS THEY MIGHT STOP HER
SO HE HAS AGREED AT LAST AND I HAVE ARRANGED THAT HE SHALL DINE WITH THE LARGE TENANTS TO-DAY
THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION HAS MADE A BREAKFAST OR A DINNER AN EASY AND CHEERFUL SUBSTITUTE FOR MORE TROUBLESOME AND DISAGREEABLE CEREMONIES
HE'S EIGHTY-THREE YOU KNOW
IT SEEMED AS IF SHE WERE ASLEEP AND YET THE GRATING OF THE LOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO WAKEN HER
FOR I FEEL IT I FEEL IT--INFINITE LOVE IS SUFFERING TOO--YEA IN THE FULNESS OF KNOWLEDGE IT SUFFERS IT YEARNS IT MOURNS
BUT IT HAPPENS ON THE CONTRARY THAT MY STRONGEST EFFORT IS TO AVOID ANY SUCH ARBITRARY PICTURE AND TO GIVE A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF MEN AND THINGS AS THEY HAVE MIRRORED THEMSELVES IN MY MIND
I'M A ROUGHISH FELLOW ALTOGETHER
SHE DIDN'T SPEAK WHEN THEY ASKED HER IF SHE'D PLEAD GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY AND THEY PLEADED NOT GUILTY FOR HER
SHE COULD NOT RESIST SPENDING HER MONEY IN BITS OF FINERY WHICH MRS POYSER DISAPPROVED
THEY DECLINED TO TAKE ANYTHING FOR HER FOOD AND BED
TELL HER I WILL COME--AT THE VERY LAST I WILL NOT URGE YOU AGAINST THE VOICE OF YOUR OWN HEART SAID DINAH
THERE WAS A CRUEL FORCE IN THEIR CALM CERTAINTY WHICH THREATENED TO GRAPPLE AND CRUSH HER FLIMSY HOPES AND FANCIES
BUT NOW THERE WAS NO MARGIN OF DREAMS FOR HIM BEYOND THIS DAYLIGHT REALITY NO HOLIDAY-TIME IN THE WORKING-DAY WORLD NO MOMENT IN THE DISTANCE WHEN DUTY WOULD TAKE OFF HER IRON GLOVE AND BREAST-PLATE AND CLASP HIM GENTLY INTO REST
BUT SAID BARTLE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AGAIN I MUST GIVE VIXEN HER SUPPER TOO CONFOUND HER
HARDLY
I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN WHEN YOU COME FROM WORK
WHY SHE LOOKS AS QUIET AS A MOUSE
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK OF YOUR HEARERS LAST NIGHT NOW
NEVER MIND YOUR BEING POORISH AS YET
BUT WHERE'S THE USE O ME TALKING TO YOU SIR
AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID NEVER WENT BOOZIN WITH THAT SET AT CASSON'S A-SITTIN SOAKIN IN DRINK AND LOOKING AS WISE AS A LOT O COD-FISH WI RED FACES IT WAS PROBABLY OWING TO THE CONVERSATION SHE HAD HAD WITH HER HUSBAND ON THEIR WAY FROM CHURCH CONCERNING THIS PROBLEMATIC STRANGER THAT MRS POYSER'S THOUGHTS IMMEDIATELY REVERTED TO HIM WHEN A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS AS SHE WAS STANDING AT THE HOUSE-DOOR WITH HER KNITTING IN THAT EAGER LEISURE WHICH CAME TO HER WHEN THE AFTERNOON CLEANING WAS DONE SHE SAW THE OLD SQUIRE ENTER THE YARD ON HIS BLACK PONY FOLLOWED BY JOHN THE GROOM
TO-DAY HE KNEW WAS HER DAY FOR GOING TO THE CHASE TO SEW WITH THE LADY'S MAID SO HE WOULD GET AS MUCH WORK DONE AS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING THAT THE NEXT MIGHT BE CLEAR
SHE REACHES THE FIRST TURNING TOWARDS THE HERMITAGE WALKING SLOWLY--HE IS NOT THERE
IT CAME IMPORTUNATELY NOW ON THIS SAD EVENING WITH THE LOW-HANGING CLOUDS BUT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS IT LEST SOME EMOTION SHOULD IMPEL HIM TO SAY MORE THAN WAS NEEDFUL FOR HETTY'S SAKE
SHALT GO HOME BEFORE THEE GO'ST TO THE PREACHING ADAM ASKED LOOKING UP
BUT THE FRANKNESS OF THE WORDS CAUSED HER IMMEDIATELY TO INTERPRET THEM INTO A RENEWAL OF HIS BROTHERLY REGRETS THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND SHE ANSWERED CALMLY DO NOT BE CAREFUL AND TROUBLED FOR ME ADAM
AND HE ASSURED ME HE SHOULD LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS--IT WOULD BE A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR HIM IN BUSINESS AND IT WOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO WHAT HE HAD LONG WISHED TO DO TO GIVE UP WORKING FOR BURGE
THERE'S ADAM BEDE A-CARRYING THE LITTLE UN IN
FOR HE SAID AS THERE WAR NO WOOD THERE AN IT UD HA BEEN A BAD COUNTRY FOR A CARPENTER AH SAID ADAM I REMEMBER FATHER TELLING ME WHEN I WAS A LITTLE LAD THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND IF EVER HE MOVED IT SHOULD BE SOUTH'ARD
ASKING WHAT SHALL WE EAT AND WHAT SHALL WE DRINK AND WHEREWITHAL SHALL WE BE CLOTHED?--CARELESS OF DISPENSING THE BREAD OF LIFE TO THEIR FLOCKS PREACHING AT BEST BUT A CARNAL AND SOUL-BENUMBING MORALITY AND TRAFFICKING IN THE SOULS OF MEN BY RECEIVING MONEY FOR DISCHARGING THE PASTORAL OFFICE IN PARISHES WHERE THEY DID NOT SO MUCH AS LOOK ON THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE MORE THAN ONCE A-YEAR
HE KNEW LITTLE OF THE LIFE OF MEN IN THE PAST
IT'S ALL RUN TO MILK BOOK THREE CHAPTER XXII GOING TO THE BIRTHDAY FEAST THE THIRTIETH OF JULY WAS COME AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE HALF-DOZEN WARM DAYS WHICH SOMETIMES OCCUR IN THE MIDDLE OF A RAINY ENGLISH SUMMER
BUT YOU ARE NOT GUILTY--YOU HAVE NOT THE WORST OF ALL SORROWS
AN HOW'S THEY TO LET THEE KNOW AS I'M A-DYIN IF THEE'T GONE A-WORKIN I DISTANT PARTS AN SETH BELIKE GONE ARTER THEE AND THY FEYTHER NOT ABLE TO HOLD A PEN FOR'S HAND SHAKIN BESIDES NOT KNOWIN WHERE THEE ART
AND HE WAS SILENTLY CALLING TO GOD FOR HELP
IT SEEMED CULPABLE IN PROVIDENCE TO ALLOW SUCH A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IF SHE HAD NOT FELT THIS SHE WOULD SURELY HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME COMFORT
I'M GOING TO THE HALL FARM BUT MAYHAP I MAY GO TO THE SCHOOL AFTER SO THEE MUSTNA WONDER IF I'M A BIT LATE
WHAT THEN
WHAT THEN
BUT IT'S MY OPINION AS THERE'S THEM AT THE HEAD O THIS COUNTRY AS ARE WORSE ENEMIES TO US NOR BONY AND ALL THE MOUNSEERS HE'S GOT AT S BACK
HAVE THE THIEVES BEEN AT THE CHURCH LEAD AGAIN THIEVES
BUT PRESENTLY HE HEARD SOMETHING THAT COMPELLED HIM TO LISTEN AND MADE THE SENSE OF SIGHT LESS ABSORBING
THERE IS MUCH LESS RISK IN DAIRY LAND THAN CORN LAND MR POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP--APPARENTLY ABSORBED IN MAKING THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS MEET SO AS TO REPRESENT WITH PERFECT ACCURACY THE RIBS OF A SHIP
THEE THINK'ST SO CAUSE SHE WOULDNA HA THEE
HE THOUGHT WHAT SHE SAID WOULD HAUNT HIM SOMEHOW
BUT WHICH ON YOU'S FOR HA'IN SUPPER
I LEFT THE PRISONER SITTING UP BY THE FIRE IN THE KITCHEN WITH THE BABY ON HER LAP
JUST AS A NATIONAL LANGUAGE MAY BE INSTINCT WITH POETRY UNFELT BY THE LIPS THAT USE IT
THAT IS THE FURNITURE OF THE DINING-ROOM
SHE HAD A TERRIFIED SENSE THAT GOD WHOM SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS VERY FAR OFF WAS VERY NEAR TO HER AND THAT JESUS WAS CLOSE BY LOOKING AT HER THOUGH SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM
SHE'D MISTOOK HER FEELINGS MARTIN WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO LOOKING ON THE GROUND AND ROOTING UP THE GRASS WITH HIS SPUD WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING
THEY WERE BOTH GLAD WHEN THE DANCE WAS ENDED
PRESENTLY SHE TOOK UP THE LETTER WITH A FIRMER HAND AND BEGAN TO READ IT THROUGH AGAIN
ONLY THERE ARE LITTLE INCIDENTS NOW AND THEN THAT SET ONE SPECULATING ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WAS THERE A MOTIVE AT WORK UNDER THIS STRANGE RELUCTANCE OF ARTHUR'S WHICH HAD A SORT OF BACKSTAIRS INFLUENCE NOT ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
I FORGAVE THEE LONG AGO IT HAD SEEMED TO ADAM AS IF HIS BRAIN WOULD BURST WITH THE ANGUISH OF MEETING HETTY'S EYES IN THE FIRST MOMENTS BUT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE UTTERING THESE PENITENT WORDS TOUCHED A CHORD WHICH HAD BEEN LESS STRAINED
BUT WHEN ADAM HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO A MEASURE HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO RENOUNCE IT FOR ANY BUT IMPERATIVE REASONS
YET THE LONG SUPPLE HAND WITH ITS BROAD FINGER-TIPS LOOKED READY FOR WORKS OF SKILL
I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY
THE MORNING SUNSHINE WHICH STILL LEAVES THE DEW-CRYSTALS ON THE FINE GOSSAMER WEBS IN THE SHADOW OF THE BUSHY HEDGEROWS
I HAVE TO GET MY LIVING WITH MY HANDS
WE FEEL ALIKE ON MOST MATTERS ON WHICH A MAN WHO IS GETTING TOWARDS FIFTY CAN FEEL IN COMMON WITH A YOUNG MAN OF ONE-AND-TWENTY AND HE HAS JUST BEEN EXPRESSING A FEELING WHICH I SHARE VERY HEARTILY AND I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY OMIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING SO
THE WORDS OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT--THE FIRST HE HAD EVER HEARD IN HIS LIFE--SEEMED LIKE SCORCHING MISSILES THAT WERE MAKING INEFFACEABLE SCARS ON HIM
AND HIS BROW MOREOVER HAD THAT PECULIAR TENSION WHICH ALWAYS IMPRESSES ONE AS A SIGN OF A KEEN IMPATIENT TEMPERAMENT
AND BESIDES I WAS SO FRIGHTENED AT GOING WANDERING ABOUT TILL I WAS A BEGGAR-WOMAN AND HAD NOTHING
MEANTIME WHEN THE SUN HAD MOVED OFF THE GREAT OPEN SPACE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THE GAMES BEGAN
ADAM STOOD MOTIONLESS WITH HIS EYES VACANTLY FIXED IN THIS WAY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
IT WAS SO NICE TO BE OUT OF DOORS AND HER AUNT ALWAYS MADE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT IT IF SHE WANTED TO GO OUT
YET NO ONE HAD RETIRED EXCEPT THE CHILDREN AND OLD FEYTHER TAFT WHO BEING TOO DEAF TO CATCH MANY WORDS HAD SOME TIME AGO GONE BACK TO HIS INGLENOOK
WHEN HE CAME BACK ADAM'S EYES WERE STILL ON THE FIRST PAGE--HE COULDN'T READ--HE COULD NOT PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER AND MAKE OUT WHAT THEY MEANT
ANY ONE WHO COULD HAVE LOOKED INTO POOR BESSY'S HEART WOULD HAVE SEEN A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HER LITTLE HOPES AND ANXIETIES AND HETTY'S
ADAM SHE WENT ON YOU WOULDN'T DESIRE THAT WE SHOULD SEEK A GOOD THROUGH ANY UNFAITHFULNESS TO THE LIGHT THAT IS IN US
WE'RE NOT ALL PUT TOGETHER ALIKE AND WE MAY MISJUDGE ONE ANOTHER
HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND OPENED THE INNER DOOR LEADING FROM THE KITCHEN INTO THE WORKSHOP INTENDING TO LET OUT GYP
ADAM HE SAID QUIETLY IT MAY BE A GOOD THING THAT WE HAVE MET HERE FOR I WISHED TO SEE YOU
SHE'D MAKE THEE RARE AND HAPPY SETH
AND WIDOW STEENE DWELT MUCH ON THE VIRTUES OF THE STUFF THE GENTLEFOLKS GAVE HER FOR HER COUGH
IT'S A STRANGE THING TO THINK OF A MAN AS CAN LIFT A CHAIR WITH HIS TEETH AND WALK FIFTY MILE ON END TREMBLING AND TURNING HOT AND COLD AT ONLY A LOOK FROM ONE WOMAN OUT OF ALL THE REST I THE WORLD
THERE'S A SORT O DAMAGE SIR THAT CAN'T BE MADE UP FOR ARTHUR WAS SILENT SOME MOMENTS
CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE IS VERY CLOSE TO HER PUTTING HIS ARM ROUND HER PERHAPS KISSING HER AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS ADMIRING AND ENVYING HER--ESPECIALLY MARY BURGE WHOSE NEW PRINT DRESS LOOKS VERY CONTEMPTIBLE BY THE SIDE OF HETTY'S RESPLENDENT TOILETTE
FOR HAD NOT MICHAEL HOLDSWORTH HAD A PAIR OF OXEN SWELTERED WHILE HE WAS PLOUGHING ON GOOD FRIDAY
HAST READ THE LETTER SAID SETH
I'D CALCULATED PRETTY CLOSE THOUGH I HADN'T MADE OUT A BILL AND I SAID ONE POUND THIRTY THAT WAS PAYING FOR THE MATER'ALS AND PAYING ME BUT NONE TOO MUCH FOR MY WORK
I'VE NEVER BEEN NO TRAVELLER MYSELF
I THINK I TASTE THAT WHEY NOW--WITH A FLAVOUR SO DELICATE THAT ONE CAN HARDLY DISTINGUISH IT FROM AN ODOUR AND WITH THAT SOFT GLIDING WARMTH THAT FILLS ONE'S IMAGINATION WITH A STILL HAPPY DREAMINESS
WHY ADDED GOOD MARTIN AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE WHAT DOST THINK HAS JUST JUMPED INTO MY HEAD SUMMAT AS HADNA FAR TO JUMP FOR IT'S JUST UNDER OUR NOSE
FOR ON A SUNDAY EVERY ONE WAS READY TO RECEIVE A GUEST--IT WAS THE DAY WHEN ALL MUST BE IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND THEIR BEST HUMOUR
IT WAS SUMMER MORNING IN HIS HEART AND HE SAW HETTY IN THE SUNSHINE--A SUNSHINE WITHOUT GLARE WITH SLANTING RAYS THAT TREMBLE BETWEEN THE DELICATE SHADOWS OF THE LEAVES
THERE WAS NO HELP
TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE ABUNDANT LAUGHTER IN THE STRIPED MARQUEE ARTHUR CLAPPED HIS HANDS CONTINUALLY AND CRIED BRAVO BUT BEN HAD ONE ADMIRER WHOSE EYES FOLLOWED HIS MOVEMENTS WITH A FERVID GRAVITY THAT EQUALLED HIS OWN
EVEN MRS POMFRET'S PREOCCUPIED MIND DID NOT PREVENT HER FROM NOTICING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A NEW FLUSH OF BEAUTY IN THE LITTLE THING AS SHE TIED ON HER HAT BEFORE THE LOOKING-GLASS
I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE HARD TOWARDS THEM AS HAVE DONE WRONG AND REPENT ADAM SPOKE THESE WORDS WITH THE FIRM DISTINCTNESS OF A MAN WHO IS RESOLVED TO LEAVE NOTHING UNSAID THAT HE IS BOUND TO SAY
Y'ULL BE GETTIN INTO MISCHIEF IF YOU DOOANT MIND YES SAID HETTY I WON'T DO IT AGAIN
BUT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE WOULD KNOW
BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE CRIMSON CLOTH THE EFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN WARM AND CHEERING WHEN MR IRWINE WAS IN THE DESK LOOKING BENIGNLY ROUND ON THAT SIMPLE CONGREGATION--ON THE HARDY OLD MEN WITH BENT KNEES AND SHOULDERS PERHAPS BUT WITH VIGOUR LEFT FOR MUCH HEDGE-CLIPPING AND THATCHING
OR IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO SPOIL A WOMAN'S EXISTENCE FOR HER WILL MAKE IT UP TO HER WITH EXPENSIVE BON-BONS PACKED UP AND DIRECTED BY HIS OWN HAND
I SHAN'T THRUST MYSELF ON HIM ONLY KEEP MY EYE ON HIM AND SEE THAT HE GETS SOME GOOD FOOD AND PUT IN A WORD HERE AND THERE THEN SAID MR IRWINE REASSURED A LITTLE AS TO BARTLE'S DISCRETION I THINK YOU'LL BE DOING A GOOD DEED
AND YE'VE GOT TWO O THE STRAPPING'ST SONS I TH COUNTRY
BUT THERE'S TIMES WHEN THE CROCKERY SEEMS ALIVE AN FLIES OUT O YOUR HAND LIKE A BIRD
WHY SHE MEANS TO GO BACK TO SNOWFIELD AGAIN AND WORK I THE MILL AND STARVE HERSELF AS SHE USED TO DO LIKE A CREATUR AS HAS GOT NO FRIENDS MR POYSER DID NOT READILY FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS HIS UNPLEASANT ASTONISHMENT
IT'S ALLAYS THE WAY WI THEM MEEK-FACED PEOPLE
GOD MADE THESE DEAR WOMEN SO--AND IT IS A CONVENIENT ARRANGEMENT IN CASE OF SICKNESS
SO I TOLD HER NOT TO PROMISE TOO MANY THANK YOU MRS POYSER SAID ARTHUR NOT WITHOUT A TWINGE
THE MOMENTARY STRUGGLE ENDED IN THE FEELING THAT HE COULD BEAR A GREAT DEAL FROM ADAM TO WHOM HE HAD BEEN THE OCCASION OF BEARING SO MUCH
FOR MARTIN POYSER FELT NO MOTIVE TO KEEP SILENCE TOWARDS THE ONE OR TWO NEIGHBOURS WHO VENTURED TO COME AND SHAKE HIM SORROWFULLY BY THE HAND ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS TROUBLE
OPEN THEIR EYES THAT THEY MAY SEE THEE--SEE THEE WEEPING OVER THEM AND SAYING YE WILL NOT COME UNTO ME THAT YE MIGHT HAVE LIFE'--SEE THEE HANGING ON THE CROSS AND SAYING FATHER FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO'--SEE THEE AS THOU WILT COME AGAIN IN THY GLORY TO JUDGE THEM AT THE LAST
YET IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO SATISFY OUR HUNGER WE TAKE ANOTHER BITE AND FIND IT POSSIBLE TO GO ON
TAKE OFF THE BRIDLE AND GIVE HIM A DRINK OSTLER SAID THE TRAVELLER TO THE LAD IN A SMOCK-FROCK WHO HAD COME OUT OF THE YARD AT THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS
BUT THERE'S FATHER I THE BARN SIR IF HE'D BE OF ANY USE NO THANK YOU
AND WHEN HER COUSINS ENTERED SHE RAISED HERSELF UP AND SHOWED A PAIR OF FLUSHED CHEEKS WHICH LOOKED FATTER THAN EVER NOW THEY WERE DEFINED BY THE EDGE OF HER LINEN NIGHT-CAP
ADAM WAS A NEW IMAGE OF THE DREADFUL PAST AND THE DREADFUL PRESENT
BUT EVERY OTHER FEELING AS IT RUSHED UPON HIS WAS THROWN INTO ABEYANCE BY PITY DEEP RESPECTFUL PITY FOR THE MAN WHO SAT BEFORE HIM--ALREADY SO BRUISED GOING FORTH WITH SAD BLIND RESIGNEDNESS TO AN UNREAL SORROW WHILE A REAL ONE WAS CLOSE UPON HIM TOO FAR BEYOND THE RANGE OF COMMON TRIAL FOR HIM EVER TO HAVE FEARED IT
AN WHAT WUT DO WHEN THY MOTHER'S GONE AN NOBODY TO TAKE CARE ON THEE AS THEE GETT'ST A BIT O VICTUAL COMFORTABLE I THE MORNIN WHAT HAST GOT I THY MIND MOTHER SAID ADAM VEXED AT THIS WHIMPERING
THE TEMPORARY SADNESS FOR HETTY WAS THE WORST CONSEQUENCE
WELL MESTER CASSON HE CONTINUED AS THAT PERSONAGE SAUNTERED UP TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MEN HOW ARE YE T NAIGHT
FOR ADAM WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE AND SO SHE PUT NO RESTRAINT ON HER COMPLAINING
ALL EYES WERE STRAINED TO LOOK AT HER BUT SHE STOOD LIKE A STATUE OF DULL DESPAIR
BUT CANDID PEOPLE HAVE THEIR SECRETS AND SECRETS LEAVE NO LINES IN YOUNG FACES
LET'S SEE IF SETH'S READY WITH BREAKFAST NOW THAT IS A SIMPLE SCENE READER
I WONNA HA NOBODY TO TOUCH THE COFFIN BUT THEE ADAM'S EYES MET SETH'S WHICH LOOKED FROM DINAH TO HIM RATHER WISTFULLY
NAY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT HUSBAND HIMSELF WHO HAS OTHER IRRITATING HABITS BESIDES THAT OF NOT WIPING HIS SHOES
ARTHUR DID NOT VENTURE TO STOP NEAR HETTY BUT MERELY BOWED TO HER AS HE PASSED ALONG THE OPPOSITE SIDE
NEAR IT THERE IS A LITTLE CHAIR AND THE BUTT END OF A BOY'S LEATHER LONG-LASHED WHIP
THEY SEEM TO LIE UPON US LIKE A DEEP FLOOD
THAT MAKES THE TIME SEEM LONGER EH WHAT AM I TO DO WI BURNIN CANDLE OF A SUNDAY WHEN THERE'S ON'Y ME AN IT'S SIN TO DO A BIT O KNITTIN
SHE BEGAN SLOWLY TO UNDRESS
AND THE EYES--O THE WORST OF ALL WAS THE LIKENESS THEY HAD TO HETTY'S
AN ME GOT SO USED TO HER
SOME O THE MEN DON'T COME TILL LATE--THEY'VE GOT SO FAR TO WALK
IT SEEMED TO HETTY AS IF THOSE DOZEN DREAMS HAD ONLY PASSED INTO ANOTHER DREAM--THAT SHE WAS IN THE HOVEL AND HER AUNT WAS STANDING OVER HER WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND
IT WOULDN'T TAKE ME MUCH TROUBLE TO PERSUADE CHAD CRANAGE AND HALF A DOZEN OTHER BULL-HEADED FELLOWS THAT THEY WOULD BE DOING AN ACCEPTABLE SERVICE TO THE CHURCH BY HUNTING WILL MASKERY OUT OF THE VILLAGE WITH ROPE-ENDS AND PITCHFORKS
CHAPTER X DINAH VISITS LISBETH AT FIVE O'CLOCK LISBETH CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A LARGE KEY IN HER HAND
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF YOU WERE STRETCHING OUT YOUR ARMS TO ME AND BECKONING ME TO COME AND TAKE MY EASE AND LIVE FOR MY OWN DELIGHT AND JESUS THE MAN OF SORROWS WAS STANDING LOOKING TOWARDS ME AND POINTING TO THE SINFUL AND SUFFERING AND AFFLICTED
YES I REMEMBER TOO WHEN MY DEAR AUNT DIED I LONGED FOR THE SOUND OF HER BAD COUGH IN THE NIGHTS INSTEAD OF THE SILENCE THAT CAME WHEN SHE WAS GONE
SHE WAS RECOVERING NOW FROM THE FIRST SHOCK OF EMOTION AND SHE LOOKED AT ADAM WITH SIMPLE SINCERE EYES AS SHE SAID YES ADAM MY HEART IS DRAWN STRONGLY TOWARDS YOU
BUT IT WAS ADAM'S STRENGTH NOT ITS CORRELATIVE HARDNESS THAT INFLUENCED HIS MEDITATIONS THIS MORNING
BUT WHEN I SEE YOU'RE BEING MADE LOVE TO BY A GENTLEMAN AS CAN NEVER MARRY YOU AND DOESNA THINK O MARRYING YOU I FEEL BOUND T INTERFERE FOR YOU
THERE REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARM IN BEING KIND TO THE LITTLE THING AND IT WAS WORTH DANCING WITH A DOZEN BALLROOM BELLES ONLY TO LOOK AT HETTY FOR HALF AN HOUR
BUT ONE GETS ONLY A CONFUSED NOTION OF THESE DETAILS WHEN THEY SURROUND A DISTRACTINGLY PRETTY GIRL OF SEVENTEEN STANDING ON LITTLE PATTENS AND ROUNDING HER DIMPLED ARM TO LIFT A POUND OF BUTTER OUT OF THE SCALE
SO GOOD COMES OUT OF EVIL
STOP A BIT SIR SAID ADAM IN A HARD PEREMPTORY VOICE WITHOUT TURNING ROUND
BUT I SHALL GO TO STONITON AGAIN TO-MORROW AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE ENOUGH IN THE STRENGTH OF ADAM'S PRINCIPLE TO TRUST THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE WORST WITHOUT BEING DRIVEN TO ANYTHING RASH MR IRWINE WHO WAS INVOLUNTARILY UTTERING HIS OWN THOUGHTS RATHER THAN ADDRESSING BARTLE MASSEY IN THE LAST SENTENCE HAD IN HIS MIND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE TO-WARDS ARTHUR WHICH WAS THE FORM ADAM'S ANGUISH WAS CONTINUALLY TAKING MIGHT MAKE HIM SEEK AN ENCOUNTER THAT WAS LIKELY TO END MORE FATALLY THAN THE ONE IN THE GROVE
SHE LIKED TO FEEL THAT THIS STRONG SKILFUL KEEN-EYED MAN WAS IN HER POWER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN INDIGNANT IF HE HAD SHOWN THE LEAST SIGN OF SLIPPING FROM UNDER THE YOKE OF HER COQUETTISH TYRANNY AND ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE GENTLE MARY BURGE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE MOST TRIFLING NOTICE FROM HIM
CRAS INGENS ITERABIMUS AEQUOR AND A FEW SHREDS OF THAT SORT WILL PERHAPS STICK TO ME AND I SHALL ARRANGE MY OPINIONS SO AS TO INTRODUCE THEM
SO ARE THE MOTIONS OF A LITTLE VESSEL WITHOUT BALLAST TOSSED ABOUT ON A STORMY SEA
HOW AT LAST THE VERY TEMPTATION TO SIN IS EXTINGUISHED AND HEAVEN IS BEGUN UPON EARTH BECAUSE NO CLOUD PASSES BETWEEN THE SOUL AND GOD WHO IS ITS ETERNAL SUN
WON'T YOU PLEASE TO SIT DOWN SIR NOT YET
HE LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS A DANCING MONKEY--AS SERIOUS AS IF HE HAD BEEN AN EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER ASCERTAINING IN HIS OWN PERSON THE AMOUNT OF SHAKING AND THE VARIETIES OF ANGULARITY THAT COULD BE GIVEN TO THE HUMAN LIMBS
IT SHINES BY ITS OWN LIGHT
INDEED HE HAD GENERALLY FOUND THEM TWICE AS COOL AND CUNNING AS HE WAS HIMSELF
TWO NEW ROOMS HAD BEEN RUN UP TO THE OLD HOUSE FOR HIS MOTHER AND SETH WERE TO LIVE WITH THEM AFTER ALL
THIS WITNESS WAS A MAN A ROUGH PEASANT
AND ADAM DISTRUSTED HIMSELF--HE HAD LEARNED TO DREAD THE VIOLENCE OF HIS OWN FEELING
WHY DO YOU COME TO FRIGHTEN ME
IF YOU CAN CATCH ADAM FOR A HUSBAND HETTY YOU'LL RIDE I YOUR OWN SPRING-CART SOME DAY I'LL BE YOUR WARRANT HETTY WAS MOVING ACROSS THE KITCHEN WITH THE CURRANTS SO HER UNCLE DID NOT SEE THE LITTLE TOSS OF THE HEAD WITH WHICH SHE ANSWERED HIM
AND HOW CAN A MAN'S CANDOUR BE SEEN IN ALL ITS LUSTRE UNLESS HE HAS A FEW FAILINGS TO TALK OF
SHE WAS EVEN BY THE WILLOW BROOK
SHE HAS A LOVING HEART THOUGH SHE'S SORELY GIVEN TO FRET AND BE FEARFUL
IT'S A HARD JOB BUT SAID ADAM I BEG PARTICULAR YOU'LL KEEP WHAT'S HAPPENED QUIET FOR A WEEK OR TWO
THE STRONGER CURIOSITY OF THE WOMEN HAD DRAWN THEM QUITE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN WHERE THEY COULD EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY THE QUAKERLIKE COSTUME AND ODD DEPORTMENT OF THE FEMALE METHODISTS
BUT THE JET-BLACK HAIR MADE THE MORE NOTICEABLE BY ITS CONTRAST WITH THE LIGHT PAPER CAP AND THE KEEN GLANCE OF THE DARK EYES THAT SHONE FROM UNDER STRONGLY MARKED PROMINENT AND MOBILE EYEBROWS INDICATED A MIXTURE OF CELTIC BLOOD
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE LANDLADY HAD SEEN THE ORNAMENTS FOR SHE HAD EXAMINED THE CONTENTS OF HETTY'S POCKET YESTERDAY AND SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD DISCUSSED THE FACT OF A COUNTRY GIRL HAVING THESE BEAUTIFUL THINGS WITH A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN EVER THAT HETTY HAD BEEN MISERABLY DELUDED BY THE FINE YOUNG OFFICER
NOT AS I'M A-FINDIN FAUT WI YE FOR'T FOR YE'VE NO CALL TO BE FRETTIN AN SOMEHOW YE LOOKEN SORRY TOO
FOR I KNOW YOUR SONS ADAM AND SETH AND I KNOW YOU HAVE NO DAUGHTER
YE'LL MAKE IT OUT AS TROUBLE'S A GOOD THING LIKE HE ALLAYS DOES
AND I WOULD NOT EVEN IF I HAD THE CHOICE BE THE CLEVER NOVELIST WHO COULD CREATE A WORLD SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS IN WHICH WE GET UP IN THE MORNING TO DO OUR DAILY WORK THAT YOU WOULD BE LIKELY TO TURN A HARDER COLDER EYE ON THE DUSTY STREETS AND THE COMMON GREEN FIELDS--ON THE REAL BREATHING MEN AND WOMEN WHO CAN BE CHILLED BY YOUR INDIFFERENCE OR INJURED BY YOUR PREJUDICE
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED--I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW HETTY WAS BLUSHING SO SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS HAPPY OR MISERABLE
SHE WOULD TELL HER AUNT WHEN SHE GOT HOME AGAIN THAT SHE SHOULD LIKE THE CHANGE OF GOING TO SNOWFIELD FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS
IT WAS INTO THIS SMALL GLASS THAT SHE CHOSE TO LOOK FIRST AFTER SEATING HERSELF
SHE'S NEVER BEEN TO SNOWFIELD
BROUGHT SUDDENLY AND INVOLUNTARILY TO THE BRINK OF CONFESSION ARTHUR SHRANK BACK AND FELT LESS DISPOSED TOWARDS IT THAN EVER
IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY TO SEE THIAS BEDE'S FUNERAL THAT THE PEOPLE WERE STANDING ABOUT THE CHURCHYARD SO LONG BEFORE SERVICE BEGAN
BUT PRESENTLY THE SOUND OF THE BASSOON AND THE KEY-BUGLES BURST FORTH
BUT IT WAS MORNING FOR IT KEPT GETTING LIGHTER AND I TURNED BACK THE WAY I'D COME
I SIT ON MY CHAIR IN THE DARK ROOM AND CLOSE MY EYES AND IT IS AS IF I WAS OUT OF THE BODY AND COULD FEEL NO WANT FOR EVERMORE
WELL SAID THE LANDLORD WHEN HETTY HAD SPREAD THE PRECIOUS TRIFLES BEFORE HIM WE MIGHT TAKE EM TO THE JEWELLER'S SHOP FOR THERE'S ONE NOT FAR OFF
MRS POYSER HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPRESSING HERSELF WITH WEIGHT ON THESE SUBJECTS THAT BY THE TIME SUPPER WAS ENDED THE ALE-JUG REFILLED AND MR POYSER'S PIPE ALIGHT SHE WAS ONCE MORE IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR AND READY AT ADAM'S REQUEST TO FETCH THE BROKEN SPINNING-WHEEL FOR HIS INSPECTION
CARRYING THE KEEN GLANCE OF HER BLUE-GREY EYE FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE DAIRY WHERE HETTY WAS MAKING UP THE BUTTER AND FROM THE DAIRY TO THE BACK KITCHEN WHERE NANCY WAS TAKING THE PIES OUT OF THE OVEN
THE TEARS CAME INTO ARTHUR'S EYES AS HE THOUGHT OF HETTY READING IT
SUCH OLD PARISHIONERS AS THEY ARE MUST NOT GO AH THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE LADY DAY SAID MRS IRWINE
I KNEW THE REST WERE NOT AT HOME BUT TO-DAY SOMETHING PREVENTED HIM FROM SAYING THAT AND HE PUT OUT HIS HAND TO HER IN SILENCE
YOU'LL REMEMBER SIR YOU'VE PROMISED TO TELL MY MOTHER AND SETH AND THE PEOPLE AT THE FARM WHO IT WAS AS LED HER WRONG ELSE THEY'LL THINK HARDER OF HER THAN SHE DESERVES
AND THEN WHEN SHE GOT TO STONITON WHERE NOBODY KNEW HER SHE WOULD ASK FOR THE COACH THAT WOULD TAKE HER ON THE WAY TO WINDSOR
WHY ADAM WE MISSED YOU I THE SINGING TO-DAY SAID MR POYSER
SHE MAKES NO MORE O SETH'S COMING A-NIGH HER NOR IF HE WAR GYP BUT SHE'S ALL OF A TREMBLE WHEN THEE'T A-SITTIN DOWN BY HER AT BREAKFAST AN A-LOOKING AT HER
AS THE WAGGON APPROACHED HER THE DRIVER HAD FALLEN BEHIND BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE FRONT OF THE BIG VEHICLE WHICH ENCOURAGED HER
HIS BROW WAS KNIT AND HIS WHOLE FACE HAD AN EXPRESSION OF WEARINESS AND PAIN
I MUST PICK UP THE TOOLS SIR ADAM SAID
HIGH UP AGAINST THE HORIZON WERE THE HUGE CONICAL MASSES OF HILL LIKE GIANT MOUNDS INTENDED TO FORTIFY THIS REGION OF CORN AND GRASS AGAINST THE KEEN AND HUNGRY WINDS OF THE NORTH
IT HURTS YOUR AUNT TO SEE EM HETTY WENT UPSTAIRS AGAIN AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE ALE MADE AN AGREEABLE DIVERSION
A DRINK O WHEY'S ALLAYS A TREAT TO ME
HE'S GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE A-PREACHIN AND A-PRAYIN HAST ANY NOTION WHICH WAY HE'S GONE SAID ADAM
THE TEARS CAME INTO THE GREY EYES TOO FAST TO BE HIDDEN AND SHE GOT UP HURRIEDLY MEANING IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT SHE WAS GOING TO PUT ON HER BONNET
GOD HELP ME
YOU FORGIVE ME IF I HAVE BEEN TOO HOT AND HASTY NOW AND THEN ADAM THOUGHT BUT LITTLE TO-DAY OF THE HARD WORK AND THE EARNINGS HE HAD SPENT ON HIS FATHER
HE LIKED TO FEEL HIS OWN IMPORTANCE AND BESIDES THAT HE CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE GOOD-WILL OF THESE PEOPLE
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO UTTER A WORD DISAGREEABLE TO YOUR FEELINGS AH YOU WITCH-MOTHER YOU SORCERESS
AH YOU THINK IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE PERSON WHO HAS GIVEN THEM TO HER AND HER THOUGHTS ARE GONE BACK NOW TO THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE PUT INTO HER HANDS
MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU
AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN TOO LONG TO TELL IN A LETTER HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO DESCRIBE TO ARTHUR THE BLUSHING LOOKS AND THE SIMPLE STRONG WORDS WITH WHICH THE FINE HONEST FELLOW TOLD HIS SECRET
WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE SNATCHED THE BRUSH FROM HIS POWERLESS RIGHT AND MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF HE WOULD PERFORM THE FEAT OF WRITING WITH HIS LEFT
BUT MR IRWINE ULL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED WITH THE JUDGE--YOU MAY RELY UPON THAT ADAM IS THERE NOBODY TO STAND BY HER AND SEEM TO CARE FOR HER IN THE COURT SAID ADAM
IF YOU GO PAST YOUR DINNER-TIME THERE'LL BE LITTLE RELISH O YOUR MEAT
POOR CHILD
POOR CHILD
AND AFTER ADMINISTERING SUCH A SCOLDING AS NATURALLY FLOWED FROM HER ANXIETY TO DO WELL BY HER HUSBAND'S NIECE--WHO HAD NO MOTHER OF HER OWN TO SCOLD HER POOR THING!--SHE WOULD OFTEN CONFESS TO HER HUSBAND WHEN THEY WERE SAFE OUT OF HEARING THAT SHE FIRMLY BELIEVED THE NAUGHTIER THE LITTLE HUZZY BEHAVED THE PRETTIER SHE LOOKED IT IS OF LITTLE USE FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT HETTY'S CHEEK WAS LIKE A ROSE-PETAL THAT DIMPLES PLAYED ABOUT HER POUTING LIPS THAT HER LARGE DARK EYES HID A SOFT ROGUISHNESS UNDER THEIR LONG LASHES AND THAT HER CURLY HAIR THOUGH ALL PUSHED BACK UNDER HER ROUND CAP WHILE SHE WAS AT WORK STOLE BACK IN DARK DELICATE RINGS ON HER FOREHEAD AND ABOUT HER WHITE SHELL-LIKE EARS
CLEARLY THE RECTOR WAS NOT WHAT IS CALLED IN THESE DAYS AN EARNEST MAN
WORDS RUSHED TO HIS LIPS THAT HE DARED NOT UTTER--THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO UTTER YET--AND SO HE WAS SILENT FOR THE LENGTH OF THAT FIELD
IT'S SQUIRE DONNITHORNE'S I SUPPOSE YES SIR THAT'S DONNITHORNE CHASE THAT IS
I'D LEFT OFF THINKING ABOUT GOING HOME--IT HAD GONE OUT O MY MIND
A MAN ABOUT TOWN MIGHT PERHAPS CONSIDER THAT THESE INFLUENCES WERE NOT TO BE FELT OUT OF A CHILD'S STORY-BOOK
I WILL SAY NO MORE UNTIL YOU HAVE JOINED ME IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH ON A DAY WHEN HE HAS WISHED ME TO APPEAR AMONG YOU AS THE FUTURE REPRESENTATIVE OF HIS NAME AND FAMILY PERHAPS THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT EXCEPT MR IRWINE WHO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPROVED ARTHUR'S GRACEFUL MODE OF PROPOSING HIS GRANDFATHER'S HEALTH
AS THE FISHERMAN'S SIGHT IS KEENEST ON THE SEA SO ADAM'S PERCEPTIONS WERE MORE AT HOME WITH TREES THAN WITH OTHER OBJECTS
YET WHEN HE GOT HOME AND TOLD HIS MOTHER THE GOOD NEWS AND ATE HIS SUPPER WHILE SHE SAT BY ALMOST CRYING FOR JOY AND WANTING HIM TO EAT TWICE AS MUCH AS USUAL BECAUSE OF THIS GOOD-LUCK HE COULD NOT HELP PREPARING HER GENTLY FOR THE COMING CHANGE BY TALKING OF THE OLD HOUSE BEING TOO SMALL FOR THEM ALL TO GO ON LIVING IN IT ALWAYS
IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH YOU GET INTO THE WRONG ROAD I THIS LIFE IF YOU RUN AFTER THIS AND THAT ONLY FOR THE SAKE O MAKING THINGS EASY AND PLEASANT TO YOURSELF
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE SEEMED TO BE LISTENING TO WHAT A WITNESS SAID
HE'LL BE COMIN OF HAGE THIS AY-'ARVEST SIR AN WE SHALL HEV FINE DOIN'S
FOR WHAT COULD HETTY HAVE BEEN BUT A SERVANT ELSEWHERE IF HER UNCLE HAD NOT TAKEN HER IN AND BROUGHT HER UP AS A DOMESTIC HELP TO HER AUNT WHOSE HEALTH SINCE THE BIRTH OF TOTTY HAD NOT BEEN EQUAL TO MORE POSITIVE LABOUR THAN THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SERVANTS AND CHILDREN
SHE THOUGHT OF ALL THE DEAR PEOPLE WHOM SHE HAD LEARNED TO CARE FOR AMONG THESE PEACEFUL FIELDS AND WHO WOULD NOW HAVE A PLACE IN HER LOVING REMEMBRANCE FOR EVER
THE TEARS ROSE AS SHE GAVE HIM THE LAST LOOK
POOR MOLLY'S MOUTH WAS RATHER WIDER OPEN THAN USUAL AS SHE WALKED ALONG WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE DOUBLE CLUSTER OF VESSELS IN HER HANDS QUITE INNOCENT OF THE EXPRESSION IN HER MISTRESS'S EYE
THAT LITTLE FIGURE COMING TOWARDS HIM IN THE GROVE THOSE DARK-FRINGED CHILDISH EYES THE LOVELY LIPS PUT UP TO KISS HIM--THAT PICTURE HAD GOT NO FAINTER WITH THE LAPSE OF MONTHS
MY AUNT HAS NOT THE PEN OF A READY WRITER AND THE WORK OF THE HOUSE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY FOR SHE IS WEAK IN BODY
AS TO THOSE EARLY CHRISTIANS WHO HAD WORSHIPPED FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD UPWARDS IN CATACOMBS THE TORCH-LIGHT AND SHADOWS MUST HAVE SEEMED NEARER THE DIVINE PRESENCE THAN THE HEATHENISH DAYLIGHT OF THE STREETS
I HATE TO SEE A MAN'S ARMS DROP DOWN AS IF HE WAS SHOT BEFORE THE CLOCK'S FAIRLY STRUCK JUST AS IF HE'D NEVER A BIT O PRIDE AND DELIGHT IN S WORK
THE SENSATIONS OF BODILY SICKNESS IN A COMFORTABLE BED AND WITH THE TENDANCE OF THE GOOD-NATURED LANDLADY MADE A SORT OF RESPITE FOR HER
TELL ME--TELL ME IF YOU CAN LOVE ME BETTER THAN A BROTHER DINAH WAS TOO ENTIRELY RELIANT ON THE SUPREME GUIDANCE TO ATTEMPT TO ACHIEVE ANY END BY A DECEPTIVE CONCEALMENT
THE GRIZZLED BUSHY EYEBROWS HAD TAKEN THEIR MORE ACUTE ANGLE OF COMPASSIONATE KINDNESS AND THE MOUTH HABITUALLY COMPRESSED WITH A POUT OF THE LOWER LIP WAS RELAXED SO AS TO BE READY TO SPEAK A HELPFUL WORD OR SYLLABLE IN A MOMENT
DO YOU FEEL ANY PAIN SIR HE SAID TENDERLY LOOSENING ARTHUR'S CRAVAT
SHE CHOOSES THIS AND BEGINS TO WALK A LITTLE FASTER AS IF SHE HAD SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF AN OBJECT TOWARDS WHICH IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO HASTEN
AND ON THE CLEAN OLD WOMEN MOSTLY FARM-LABOURERS WIVES WITH THEIR BIT OF SNOW-WHITE CAP-BORDER UNDER THEIR BLACK BONNETS AND WITH THEIR WITHERED ARMS BARE FROM THE ELBOW FOLDED PASSIVELY OVER THEIR CHESTS
DINAH'S BEEN SPEAKING THE WORD TO A LITTLE COMPANY OF HEARERS AT BRIMSTONE'S AS THEY CALL HIM
THE BOYS GOT OFF THEIR CHAIRS AND JUMPED ROUND HER CLAPPING THEIR HANDS AND EVEN ALICK GAVE A LOW VENTRAL LAUGH AS HE LOOKED UP FROM HIS BEANS
ADAM PATTED HER HEAD AND LIFTED HER UP TO KISS HER BUT DINAH COULD SEE THE MARKS OF AGITATION ON HIS FACE AS SHE APPROACHED HIM AND HE PUT HER ARM WITHIN HIS IN SILENCE
AN ME TO LIVE TO SEE THAT
A SUBSTANTIAL MAN SAYS HE WITH PRETTY NEAR SIXTY YEARS EXPERIENCE O TIMBER
IT'S AN ERRAND TO YOU BROUGHT ME DINAH SAID ADAM APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS HOLDING HER HAND ALL THE WHILE
AND THE BULL-DOG WAS IN ONE OF HIS MOST EXCITED MOMENTS FOR IT WAS THAT HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN THE COWS WERE BEING DRIVEN INTO THE YARD FOR THEIR AFTERNOON MILKING
SHE TOLD ME I MIGHT WRITE HER WORD AFTER A WHILE HOW WE WENT ON AND HOW MOTHER BORE UP UNDER HER TROUBLE
THEE'T SEE HER AGAIN O SUNDAY AFORE SHE GOES WERE HER FIRST WORDS
KNEW WITH ONLY LOOKING AT IT THE VALUE OF THE CHESTNUT-TREE THAT WAS BLOWN DOWN AND WHY THE DAMP CAME IN THE WALLS AND WHAT THEY MUST DO TO STOP THE RATS
THE METHODISTS DON'T COME TO PREACH IN LITTLE VILLAGES LIKE HAYSLOPE WHERE THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF LABOURERS TOO TIRED TO LISTEN TO THEM
THE HORROR OF THIS COLD AND DARKNESS AND SOLITUDE--OUT OF ALL HUMAN REACH--BECAME GREATER EVERY LONG MINUTE
NOW HE'S THRIFTY AND DECENT AND HE AND HIS WIFE LOOK COMFORTABLE TOGETHER
MARTIN POYSER'S LARGE PERSON SHOOK WITH HIS SILENT UNCTUOUS LAUGH
WHY DIDNA DINAH COME BACK WI YE
SURELY DINAH YOU'D BE AS NEAR TO GOD AS IF YOU WAS LIVING LONELY AND AWAY FROM ME DINAH MADE NO ANSWER FOR SOME TIME
THEY'RE FOLKS AS NEVER GO TO CHURCH HARDLY--THEM ON THE COMMON--BUT THEY'LL GO AND HEAR DINAH A BIT
THAT I CAN'T TELL WHETHER ANYTHING'S HAPPENED TO HER
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW I REMEMBER HER LOOKS AND HER VOICE
BUT NOW I SHALL BELIKE BE HATEFUL TO HER BECAUSE I'M SO DIFFERENT TO HIM
SHE WANTED TO RESIST THEM--SHE WANTED TO THROW THEM OFF WITH ANGRY CONTRADICTION--BUT THE DETERMINATION TO CONCEAL WHAT SHE FELT STILL GOVERNED HER
SUBJECTS ARE SOMETIMES BROACHED WHICH A WELL-BRED FEMALE WILL IGNORE BUT WHERE'S THE USE OF TALKING TO A WOMAN WITH BABBIES CONTINUED BARTLE
OH THE DELIGHT OF TAKING OUT THAT LITTLE BOX AND LOOKING AT THE EAR-RINGS
IT WAS NOT TILL HE HAD TIRED HIMSELF WITH HOURS OF TOSSING WAKEFULNESS THAT DROWSINESS CAME AND LED ON A HEAVIER MORNING SLEEP THAN WAS USUAL WITH HIM
AT LAST HE CALLED FOR A LIGHT AND A DRAUGHT OF WATER BEER WAS A THING ONLY TO BE DRUNK ON HOLIDAYS AND LISBETH VENTURED TO SAY AS SHE TOOK IT IN THY SUPPER STAN'S READY FOR THEE WHEN THEE LIK'ST DONNA THEE SIT UP MOTHER SAID ADAM IN A GENTLE TONE
DO YOU COME EVERY WEEK TO SEE MRS POMFRET YES SIR EVERY THURSDAY ONLY WHEN SHE'S GOT TO GO OUT WITH MISS DONNITHORNE AND SHE'S TEACHING YOU SOMETHING IS SHE YES SIR THE LACE-MENDING AS SHE LEARNT ABROAD AND THE STOCKING-MENDING--IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE STOCKING YOU CAN'T TELL IT'S BEEN MENDED
AND I SAY IT AGAIN YOU'RE ACTING THE PART OF A SELFISH LIGHT-MINDED SCOUNDREL THOUGH IT CUTS ME TO TH HEART TO SAY SO AND I'D RATHER HA LOST MY RIGHT HAND LET ME TELL YOU ADAM SAID ARTHUR BRIDLING HIS GROWING ANGER AND TRYING TO RECUR TO HIS CARELESS TONE YOU'RE NOT ONLY DEVILISHLY IMPERTINENT BUT YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE
AND SHE HATED GOING INTO THE PUBLIC HOUSES WHERE SHE MUST GO TO GET FOOD AND ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE THERE WERE ALWAYS MEN LOUNGING THERE WHO STARED AT HER AND JOKED HER RUDELY
I TELL YOU A WOMAN ULL MAKE YOUR PORRIDGE EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY YEARS AND NEVER THINK OF MEASURING THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE MEAL AND THE MILK--A LITTLE MORE OR LESS SHE'LL THINK DOESN'T SIGNIFY
YOU NEVER SAW HER SIR DID YOU YES I DID
AS FOR DINAH MRS POYSER HAD SMALL HOPE OF THEIR BRINGING HER UNLESS THEY COULD MAKE HER BELIEVE THE FOLKS AT HAYSLOPE WERE TWICE AS MISERABLE AS THE FOLKS AT SNOWFIELD
GOD BLESS YOU
I SHALL HAVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE NOW I'M OF AGE
HIS ARM IS STEALING ROUND THE WAIST AGAIN
WE USE ROUND GENERAL GENTLEMANLY EPITHETS ABOUT A YOUNG MAN OF BIRTH AND FORTUNE
THAT WAS POOR LITTLE HETTY'S CONSCIENCE
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT GREAT SCHOLARS WHO HAVE SHOWN THE MOST PITILESS ACERBITY IN THEIR CRITICISM OF OTHER MEN'S SCHOLARSHIP HAVE YET BEEN OF A RELENTING AND INDULGENT TEMPER IN PRIVATE LIFE
I SHOULD HAVE SPRINKLED THE BOARD WITH HOLY WATER BEFORE WE BEGAN
SETH WENT WITH HIM THE FIRST MILE OR TWO FOR THE THOUGHT OF SNOWFIELD AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT DINAH MIGHT COME AGAIN MADE HIM RESTLESS AND THE WALK WITH ADAM IN THE COLD MORNING AIR BOTH IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES HELPED TO GIVE HIM A SENSE OF SUNDAY CALM
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE IN MY HEAD SIR HE SAID AND I HOPE YOU'LL APPROVE OF IT
AROUND THE FARMHOUSES THERE WAS A SOUND OF CLAPPING DOORS
WE CAN MAKE THAT UP
THAT'S WHERE OUR PEOPLE GETS IT FROM THOUGH THERE'S ONLY TWO MEN OF EM IN ALL HAYSLOPE
IF IT HAD BEEN SO THAT SHE COULD HA MARRIED SETH THAT UD HA BEEN A GREAT BLESSING TO US BUT WE CAN'T HAVE THINGS JUST AS WE LIKE IN THIS LIFE
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF ADAM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY AND I HAVE NEVER LOST MY OLD FEELING FOR HIM--I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT I KNOW A GOOD FELLOW WHEN I FIND HIM
YEA I SAY UNTO YOU AND MORE THAN A PROPHETESS--A UNCOMMON PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN COME BEN SAID ADAM RATHER STERNLY YOU LET THE WORDS O THE BIBLE ALONE
THE WEATHER"--AS HE OBSERVED THE NEXT MORNING--"THE WEATHER YOU SEE S A TICKLISH THING AN A FOOL ULL HIT ON'T SOMETIMES WHEN A WISE MAN MISSES
YOU SHALL KNOW ABOUT IT SHORTLY--WE'LL TALK OF IT TO-NIGHT
SHE'S BUT A YOUNG UN AND IT'S THE FIRST HARM I'VE KNOWED ON HER
AND HE SCOLDED EM FROM THE PULPIT AS IF HE'D BEEN A RANTER AND YET HE COULDN'T ABIDE THE DISSENTERS AND WAS A DEAL MORE SET AGAINST EM THAN MR IRWINE WAS
WHEN THERE'S A BIGGER MAGGOT THAN USUAL IN YOUR HEAD YOU CALL IT DIRECTION
SHALL I ALLAYS SEE IT HETTY CLUNG ROUND DINAH AND SHUDDERED AGAIN
IF A GOOD CHANCE COMES TO ME I'LL THINK O WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
GOD FORBID
HETTY IN HER RED CLOAK AND WARM BONNET WITH HER BASKET IN HER HAND IS TURNING TOWARDS A GATE BY THE SIDE OF THE TREDDLESTON ROAD BUT NOT THAT SHE MAY HAVE A MORE LINGERING ENJOYMENT OF THE SUNSHINE AND THINK WITH HOPE OF THE LONG UNFOLDING YEAR
I SEE HIM MYSELF HE SAID
AND YET I MIGHT HA GOT ANOTHER WIFE EASY ENOUGH IF I HADN'T SET MY HEART ON HER
MRS POYSER USED TO SAY--YOU KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE HER WORD ABOUT EVERYTHING--SHE SAID MR IRWINE WAS LIKE A GOOD MEAL O VICTUAL YOU WERE THE BETTER FOR HIM WITHOUT THINKING ON IT AND MR RYDE WAS LIKE A DOSE O PHYSIC HE GRIPPED YOU AND WORRETED YOU AND AFTER ALL HE LEFT YOU MUCH THE SAME BUT DIDN'T MR RYDE PREACH A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT THAT SPIRITUAL PART OF RELIGION THAT YOU TALK OF ADAM
AND SO THE DAY GOES ON AND I'M ALWAYS THE SAME LAZY FELLOW BEFORE EVENING SETS IN
NOW THE GREAT CEREMONY OF THE EVENING WAS TO BEGIN--THE HARVEST-SONG IN WHICH EVERY MAN MUST JOIN
WE DIDN'T BRING OURSELVES INTO THE WORLD WE CAN'T KEEP OURSELVES ALIVE WHILE WE'RE SLEEPING
I DIDN'T GO OUT AT THE SHOP DOOR BUT AT THE BACK DOOR WHICH OPENS INTO A NARROW ALLEY
AND THEE WAST TWICE AS BUXOM AS DINAH TEN YEAR AGO I NIVER SAID AS A WOMAN HAD NEED TO BE UGLY TO MAKE A GOOD MISSIS OF A HOUSE
MR IRWINE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN
THERE'S THE TATERS WI THE GRAVY IN EM JUST AS THEE LIK'ST EM
ADAM YOU WILL SEE HER WHEN SHE COMES BACK
SHE CRUSHED IT UP AGAIN IN ANGER
NOW THERE'S MR IRWINE HAS GOT NOTIONS O BUILDING MORE NOR MOST ARCHITECTS
HE SPOKE VERY HANDSOME TO ME TH OTHER DAY ABOUT LENDING ME MONEY TO SET UP I BUSINESS
AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO
AH THAT IS A BLESSED TIME ISN'T IT SETH WHEN THE OUTWARD LIGHT IS FADING AND THE BODY IS A LITTLE WEARIED WITH ITS WORK AND ITS LABOUR
THERE WERE TWO PRETTY PICTURES ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE WALL IN THE COTTAGE
A SUDDEN DREAD HERE FELL LIKE A SHADOW ACROSS HIS IMAGINATION--THE DREAD LEST SHE SHOULD DO SOMETHING VIOLENT IN HER GRIEF
LET ME KNOW IF YOU'RE IN ANY TROUBLE
YES YES
WHEN A MAN'S SPOILED HIS FELLOW-CREATUR'S LIFE HE'S NO RIGHT TO COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THINKING GOOD MAY COME OUT OF IT
COME ADAM THEN TAKE ONE PERSISTED MR POYSER ELSE Y ARENA HALF A MAN ADAM GOT UP BLUSHING LIKE A SMALL MAIDEN--GREAT STRONG FELLOW AS HE WAS--AND PUTTING HIS ARM ROUND HETTY STOOPED DOWN AND GENTLY KISSED HER LIPS
THE WEARY WANDERER'S REST GIVE ME THY EASY YOKE TO BEAR
TO THINK O THAT DEAR CHERUB
THE WIDE-OPEN GLAZED EYES WERE GREY LIKE SETH'S AND HAD ONCE LOOKED WITH MILD PRIDE ON THE BOYS BEFORE WHOM THIAS HAD LIVED TO HANG HIS HEAD IN SHAME
BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY MORNING THE HOME AT THE HALL FARM WAS A HOUSE OF MOURNING FOR A MISFORTUNE FELT TO BE WORSE THAN DEATH
AN SIT UP BURNIN CANDLE AN LIE A-BED WI THE SUN A-BAKIN YOU LIKE A COWCUMBER I THE FRAME
BUT NOW I BELIEVE I HAVE A CLEAR SHOWING THAT MY WORK LIES ELSEWHERE--AT LEAST FOR A TIME
AN SHE'S GOT SUCH A LONG FOOT SHE'LL BE HER FATHER'S OWN CHILD AYE SHE'LL BE WELLY SUCH A ONE AS HETTY I TEN YEARS TIME ON'Y SHE'S GOT THY COLOURED EYES
FOR THEN THE VERY HARDSHIP AND THE SORROW AND THE BLINDNESS AND THE SIN I HAVE BEHELD AND BEEN READY TO WEEP OVER--YEA ALL THE ANGUISH OF THE CHILDREN OF MEN WHICH SOMETIMES WRAPS ME ROUND LIKE SUDDEN DARKNESS--I CAN BEAR WITH A WILLING PAIN AS IF I WAS SHARING THE REDEEMER'S CROSS
THE TWO GREY DONKEYS JUST VISIBLE IN FRONT OF THE GORSE BUSHES STOOD AS STILL AS LIMESTONE IMAGES--AS STILL AS THE GREY-THATCHED ROOF OF THE MUD COTTAGE A LITTLE FARTHER ON
IT IS THE FAVOURITE STRATAGEM OF OUR PASSIONS TO SHAM A RETREAT AND TO TURN SHARP ROUND UPON US AT THE MOMENT WE HAVE MADE UP OUR MINDS THAT THE DAY IS OUR OWN
WE COULD NOT BLESS EACH OTHER ADAM IF THERE WERE DOUBTS IN MY SOUL AND IF I YEARNED WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE AFTER THAT BETTER PART WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN GIVEN ME AND I HAD PUT AWAY FROM ME BUT IF A NEW FEELING HAS COME INTO YOUR MIND DINAH AND IF YOU LOVE ME SO AS TO BE WILLING TO BE NEARER TO ME THAN TO OTHER PEOPLE ISN'T THAT A SIGN THAT IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
YOU WILL SEE MR IRWINE TO-MORROW AND CONSULT WITH HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING ARE YOU GOING SOON SIR SAID ADAM
WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA-A-A IT'S ALL RIGHT--IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE THE REST OF THE PARTY BEING LOAMSNIRE MEN MR CASSON HAD THE LAUGH STRONGLY AGAINST HIM AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
SETH HAD NOT HEARD ADAM'S ENTRANCE BUT HE HAD BEEN ROUSED BY GYP'S BARK AND ADAM HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT IN THE ROOM ABOVE DRESSING HIMSELF
I KNOW THERE'S A DUTY TO BE DONE BY MY FATHER BUT IT ISN'T MY DUTY TO ENCOURAGE HIM IN RUNNING HEADLONG TO RUIN
THEN THE RHYTHMIC STAMPING OF THE THICK SHOES WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN ANY DRUMS
THE SUNSHINE SEEMED TO CALL ALL THINGS TO REST AND NOT TO LABOUR
BOOK TWO CHAPTER XVII IN WHICH THE STORY PAUSES A LITTLE THIS RECTOR OF BROXTON IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A PAGAN I HEAR ONE OF MY READERS EXCLAIM
OH YES
I HAVE HAD CONSTANT WORK IN THE MILL THOUGH SOME OF THE OTHER HANDS HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF FOR A TIME AND MY BODY IS GREATLY STRENGTHENED SO THAT I FEEL LITTLE WEARINESS AFTER LONG WALKING AND SPEAKING
JUDITH AND ME ALLAYS HUNG TOGETHER THOUGH SHE HAD SUCH QUEER WAYS BUT YOUR MOTHER AND HER NEVER COULD AGREE
I KNOW THERE'S THEM AS IS BORN T OWN THE LAND AND THEM AS IS BORN TO SWEAT ON'T"--HERE MRS POYSER PAUSED TO GASP A LITTLE--"AND I KNOW IT'S CHRISTENED FOLKS'S DUTY TO SUBMIT TO THEIR BETTERS AS FUR AS FLESH AND BLOOD ULL BEAR IT
MOTHER'S IN THE RIGHT
AND MR IRWINE IS TO HAVE THE CHIEF AUTHORITY ON THE ESTATE--HE HAS CONSENTED TO UNDERTAKE THAT
IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT--ROCKS AND CAVES SUCH AS YOU NEVER SAW IN YOUR LIFE
BUT ARTHUR KISSED HER TEARFUL FACE MORE TENDERLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
I RECKON HE WANTS TO WATCH US DOWN THE FIELD
I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK IF I LIVE TO BE AS OLD AS TH OLD SQUIRE
HE MUST GIVE HER THE LETTER
ON ONE OF THESE DAYS SOON AFTER HER AUNT CAME DOWN HETTY WENT TO TREDDLESTON TO BUY SOME OF THE WEDDING THINGS WHICH WERE WANTING AND WHICH MRS POYSER HAD SCOLDED HER FOR NEGLECTING OBSERVING THAT SHE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FOR TH OUTSIDE ELSE SHE'D HA BOUGHT EM FAST ENOUGH IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HETTY SET OFF AND THE SLIGHT HOAR-FROST THAT HAD WHITENED THE HEDGES IN THE EARLY MORNING HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE SUN MOUNTED THE CLOUDLESS SKY
HE HAD BEEN IN BED AND ASLEEP WHEN DINAH HAD COME IN IN THE EVENING AND NOW HE WONDERED WHOSE STEP THIS COULD BE
I COULDN'T HELP TAKING TO THE LITTLE THING AND BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT IT
BUT WE MUST WAIT DINAH SAID ADAM MOURNFULLY YOU CAN'T LOVE ME SO WELL AS I LOVE YOU ELSE YOU'D HAVE NO DOUBTS
THE NATUR O THINGS DOESN'T CHANGE THOUGH IT SEEMS AS IF ONE'S OWN LIFE WAS NOTHING BUT CHANGE
BUT BARTLE MASSEY LAID DOWN HIS PIPE AND PUT HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS
DO ANY OF US
SHE WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE-PLACE WHEN HE ENTERED AND HE SAT TALKING TO MR AND MRS POYSER FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH A HEAVY FEAR ON HIS HEART THAT THEY MIGHT PRESENTLY TELL HIM HETTY WAS ILL
HIS FINELY FORMED PLUMP WHITE HAND WAS PLAYING ALONG JUNO'S BROWN CURLY BACK
BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT
BUT IT IS A TIME OF LEISURE ON THE FARM--THAT PAUSE BETWEEN HAY-AND CORN-HARVEST AND SO THE FARMERS AND LABOURERS IN HAYSLOPE AND BROXTON THOUGHT THE CAPTAIN DID WELL TO COME OF AGE JUST THEN WHEN THEY COULD GIVE THEIR UNDIVIDED MINDS TO THE FLAVOUR OF THE GREAT CASK OF ALE WHICH HAD BEEN BREWED THE AUTUMN AFTER THE HEIR WAS BORN AND WAS TO BE TAPPED ON HIS TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY
IT IS BUT SELDOM I MAKE ONE BUT I REMEMBERED MRS IRWINE WAS FOND OF EM
I'M TREMENDOUSLY IN WANT OF SOME BRANDY-VIGOUR I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU'VE GOT A LIGHT SIR SAID ADAM
THEY CAN BE INJURED BY US THEY CAN BE WOUNDED
AND LAST OF ALL BARTLE MASSEY WITH LISBETH--LISBETH IN A NEW GOWN AND BONNET TOO BUSY WITH HER PRIDE IN HER SON AND HER DELIGHT IN POSSESSING THE ONE DAUGHTER SHE HAD DESIRED TO DEVISE A SINGLE PRETEXT FOR COMPLAINT
AS HETTY BEGAN LANGUIDLY TO TAKE OFF THE CLOTHES SHE HAD WORN ALL THE NIGHT THAT SHE MIGHT WASH HERSELF AND BRUSH HER HAIR SHE HAD A SICKENING SENSE THAT HER LIFE WOULD GO ON IN THIS WAY
HOW PALE AND WORN HE LOOKS
HIM AS GETS TO TH HOME-GATE FIRST SHALL BE THE FIRST TO GO WITH ME TO BINTON COPPICE ON THE DONKEY
YES SHE COULD SURELY GET SOME MONEY FOR HER ORNAMENTS
OUR MORAL SENSE LEARNS THE MANNERS OF GOOD SOCIETY AND SMILES WHEN OTHERS SMILE BUT WHEN SOME RUDE PERSON GIVES ROUGH NAMES TO OUR ACTIONS SHE IS APT TO TAKE PART AGAINST US
YE'N SWELTERED YOURSEN I RECKON RUNNING THAT FOOL'S RACE
NATURE HAS HER LANGUAGE AND SHE IS NOT UNVERACIOUS
WHEN I'VE MADE UP MY MIND THAT I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A TEMPTING DOG I TAKE NO NOTICE OF HIM BECAUSE IF HE TOOK A STRONG FANCY TO ME AND LOOKED LOVINGLY AT ME THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ARITHMETIC AND INCLINATION MIGHT BECOME UNPLEASANTLY SEVERE
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT ADAM
BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO REJOICE JUST NOW YOU'VE BEEN WORRIED BY THIS LAW BUSINESS THAT YOU'VE BEEN TO STONITON ABOUT
I TELL YOU YOU'RE A COWARD AND A SCOUNDREL AND I DESPISE YOU THE COLOUR HAD ALL RUSHED BACK TO ARTHUR'S FACE
I FANCY YOU WOULD MASTER A WISH THAT YOU HAD MADE UP YOUR MIND IT WAS NOT QUITE RIGHT TO INDULGE AS EASILY AS YOU WOULD KNOCK DOWN A DRUNKEN FELLOW WHO WAS QUARRELSOME WITH YOU
IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BLIND PROMPTING NOW FOR SHE WAS UNABLE TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS
WELL MR BEDE YOU'RE ONE O THEM AS MOUNTS HUP'ARDS APACE HE SAID WHEN ADAM SAT DOWN
AN I FEEL I FAULT MYSELF FOR SHE WAS MY NIECE AND I WAS ALLAYS HOT FOR HER MARR'ING YE
I CAN'T CATCH SIGHT OF HIM ANYWHERE BETWEEN THE HEDGES BY THE ROADSIDE SAID DINAH
AND ALL HIS PICTURES OF THE FUTURE WHEN HE SHOULD COME INTO THE ESTATE WERE MADE UP OF A PROSPEROUS CONTENTED TENANTRY ADORING THEIR LANDLORD WHO WOULD BE THE MODEL OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN--MANSION IN FIRST-RATE ORDER ALL ELEGANCE AND HIGH TASTE--JOLLY HOUSEKEEPING FINEST STUD IN LOAMSHIRE--PURSE OPEN TO ALL PUBLIC OBJECTS--IN SHORT EVERYTHING AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE FROM WHAT WAS NOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE NAME OF DONNITHORNE
I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN IT'S OVER FOR I THINK MY MOTHER ULL PERHAPS GET EASIER THEN
IT IS AS HARD TO A BOY OR GIRL TO BELIEVE THAT A GREAT WRETCHEDNESS WILL ACTUALLY BEFALL THEM AS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL DIE
LISBETH SAT DOWN ON THE CHOPPING BENCH AND BEGAN TO CRY AND BY THE TIME SHE HAD CRIED ENOUGH TO MAKE HER VOICE VERY PITEOUS SHE BURST OUT INTO WORDS
I MAKE NO SCHEMES NOW
AND POYSER IS SUCH A GOOD TENANT THAT DONNITHORNE IS LIKELY TO THINK TWICE AND DIGEST HIS SPLEEN RATHER THAN TURN THEM OUT
SHE WANTED TO BE TREATED LOVINGLY--OH IT WAS VERY HARD TO BEAR THIS BLANK OF ABSENCE SILENCE APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AFTER THOSE MOMENTS OF GLOWING LOVE
LITTLE PATTING AND ROLLING MOVEMENTS WITH THE PALM OF THE HAND AND NICE ADAPTATIONS AND FINISHINGS WHICH CANNOT AT ALL BE EFFECTED WITHOUT A GREAT PLAY OF THE POUTING MOUTH AND THE DARK EYES
IT DOES ME GOOD ON'Y A LOOK O THE LAD'S EYE WHEN HE MEANS KIND TOW'RT ME DINAH TRIED TO ESCAPE FROM LISBETH'S CLOSEST LOOKS AND QUESTIONS BY FINDING LITTLE TASKS OF HOUSEWORK THAT KEPT HER MOVING ABOUT AND AS SOON AS SETH CAME HOME IN THE EVENING SHE PUT ON HER BONNET TO GO
A FINE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T INSURE ONE AGAINST SMALLPOX OR ANY OTHER OF THOSE INEVITABLE DISEASES
I SUPPOSE IT'S A BIT HARD TO US TO THINK ANYTHING'S OVER AND GONE IN OUR LIVES
HE HAD HARDLY LOOKED AT HER TO-DAY
HE SAID NOTHING BUT THREW OFF HIS JACKET AND BEGAN TO ROLL UP HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES AGAIN
MAKE THEM MORE ACCORDANT WITH THOSE CORRECT VIEWS WHICH IT IS OUR PRIVILEGE TO POSSESS
DO YOU MEAN TO GO ON TURNING UP YOUR NOSE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT'S GOT A BIT OF A SMELL ABOUT IT THAT NOBODY FINDS OUT BUT YOURSELF
IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH SHE DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY ME SIR SAID ADAM
AND WHEN HE HEARD THE WORDS OF HONEST RETRACTATION--WHEN HE HEARD THE SAD APPEAL WITH WHICH ADAM ENDED--HE WAS OBLIGED TO REJOICE IN THE REMAINS OF IGNORANT CONFIDENCE IT IMPLIED
HE HIMSELF WAS GOING TO EAT HIS DINNER AT THIS PUBLIC LATE AT NIGHT THEY REACHED LEICESTER AND SO THIS SECOND DAY OF HETTY'S JOURNEY WAS PAST
ON WET SUNDAYS OR WHENEVER HE HAD A TOUCH OF RHEUMATISM HE USED TO READ THE THREE FIRST CHAPTERS OF GENESIS INSTEAD
THE AIR HAD BEEN MERRY WITH THE RINGING OF CHURCH-BELLS VERY EARLY THIS MORNING AND EVERY ONE HAD MADE HASTE TO GET THROUGH THE NEEDFUL WORK BEFORE TWELVE WHEN IT WOULD BE TIME TO THINK OF GETTING READY TO GO TO THE CHASE
HE WILL NEVER GET BEYOND THAT BORDER-LAND OF SIN WHERE HE WILL BE PERPETUALLY HARASSED BY ASSAULTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOUNDARY
I MIGHT SELECT THE MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE TYPE OF CLERGYMAN AND PUT MY OWN ADMIRABLE OPINIONS INTO HIS MOUTH ON ALL OCCASIONS
OH WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
GYP WAS EVIDENTLY UNEASY FOR HE SAT ON HIS HAUNCHES RESTING HIS NOSE ON HIS MASTER'S STRETCHED-OUT LEG AND DIVIDING THE TIME BETWEEN LICKING THE HAND THAT HUNG LISTLESSLY DOWN AND GLANCING WITH A LISTENING AIR TOWARDS THE DOOR
MY AUNT BROUGHT ME UP FROM A BABY
AND THERE WERE MANY WET PLACES FOR HER TO BE CARRIED OVER THIS AFTERNOON FOR THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY SHOWERS IN THE MORNING THOUGH NOW THE CLOUDS HAD ROLLED OFF AND LAY IN TOWERING SILVERY MASSES ON THE HORIZON
BUT SEE WHAT CLOUDS HAVE GATHERED SINCE WE SET OUT
AND YET AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A STIRRING OF AFFECTION AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WHOM HE HAD BELIEVED IN BEFORE HE HAD COME UP TO THIS BEECH EIGHT MONTHS AGO
SHE WAS SILENT FOR SOME MOMENTS AND WHEN SHE BEGAN AGAIN IT WAS IN A WHISPER
DINAH COVERED WITH HER LONG WHITE DRESS HER PALE FACE FULL OF SUBDUED EMOTION ALMOST LIKE A LOVELY CORPSE INTO WHICH THE SOUL HAS RETURNED CHARGED WITH SUBLIMER SECRETS AND A SUBLIMER LOVE
THEY'LL HANG ME O MONDAY--IT'S FRIDAY NOW AS HETTY SAID THE LAST WORDS SHE CLUNG CLOSER TO DINAH SHUDDERING
FOR THE FIRST TIME HETTY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SOOTHING TO HER IN ADAM'S TIMID YET MANLY TENDERNESS
THEY LIKE THE SHORTHORNS AS GIVE SUCH A LOT O MILK
AND THE PRESENT DONKEY PROVED THE FIRST-RATE ORDER OF HIS INTELLIGENCE BY COMING TO A DEAD STANDSTILL JUST WHEN THE BLOWS WERE THICKEST
WE ARE APT TO BE KINDER TO THE BRUTES THAT LOVE US THAN TO THE WOMEN THAT LOVE US
THEE'T FOND ENOUGH O WRITIN WHEN NOBODY WANTS THEE I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE'D BE I THAT BIG TOWN SAID SETH
THERE IS A STRENGTH OF SELF-POSSESSION WHICH IS THE SIGN THAT THE LAST HOPE HAS DEPARTED
AND NOT TO BE OBLIGED TO GET UP EARLY OR BE SCOLDED BY ANYBODY
PIERCE THE DARKNESS
HE PERCEIVED A CHANGE OF SUBJECT WOULD BE WELCOME AND SAID BY THE WAY ARTHUR AT YOUR COLONEL'S BIRTHDAY FETE THERE WERE SOME TRANSPARENCIES THAT MADE A GREAT EFFECT IN HONOUR OF BRITANNIA AND PITT AND THE LOAMSHIRE MILITIA AND ABOVE ALL THE GENEROUS YOUTH THE HERO OF THE DAY
MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH A TURN-UP NOSE AND A PROTUBERANT JAW WAS REALLY A TENDER-HEARTED GIRL AND AS MRS POYSER SAID A JEWEL TO LOOK AFTER THE POULTRY
THEN DRINK BOYS DRINK
BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A-COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF NO NO MY DEAR MRS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
BUT THE TOAST COULD NOT BE REJECTED AND WHEN IT HAD BEEN DRUNK ARTHUR SAID I THANK YOU BOTH FOR MY GRANDFATHER AND MYSELF
AND THAT LOVELY TEARFUL FACE OF HETTY'S WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT THE SENSITIVE FIBRE IN MOST MEN
SHE'LL GET NEITHER A PLACE NOR A HUSBAND ANY THE SOONER FOR IT
HE IMAGINED NO CAUSE THAT COULD HAVE DRIVEN HER TO SUCH A STEP AFTER THAT LETTER WRITTEN IN AUGUST
IT HAD NOT YET OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT GET MONEY FOR HER LOCKET AND EARRINGS WHICH SHE CARRIED WITH HER AND SHE APPLIED ALL HER SMALL ARITHMETIC AND KNOWLEDGE OF PRICES TO CALCULATING HOW MANY MEALS AND HOW MANY RIDES WERE CONTAINED IN HER TWO GUINEAS AND THE ODD SHILLINGS WHICH HAD A MELANCHOLY LOOK AS IF THEY WERE THE PALE ASHES OF THE OTHER BRIGHT-FLAMING COIN
HE ONLY KNEW THAT THE SIGHT AND MEMORY OF HER MOVED HIM DEEPLY TOUCHING THE SPRING OF ALL LOVE AND TENDERNESS ALL FAITH AND COURAGE WITHIN HIM
BUT I WAIT TO BE TAUGHT
AYE SIR I'VE SAID IT OFTEN AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THEY'RE A POOR LOT I THIS PARISH--A POOR LOT SIR BIG AND LITTLE I THINK HE HAD A DIM IDEA THAT IF HE COULD MIGRATE TO A DISTANT PARISH HE MIGHT FIND NEIGHBOURS WORTHY OF HIM
I WON'T ASK YOU TO GO TO CHURCH WITH ME OF A SUNDAY
IT UD BE WRONG OF ME TO SAY NOTHING UD TURN HER HE ANSWERED
THEY RARELY SPOKE TO EACH OTHER AND NEVER LOOKED AT EACH OTHER EVEN OVER THEIR DISH OF COLD POTATOES
ADAM WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE A SEPARATE HOUSE NOW AND PROVIDE FOR HIS MOTHER IN THE OLD ONE
HOW COULD HE MAKE IRWINE UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION UNLESS HE TOLD HIM THOSE LITTLE SCENES IN THE WOOD
HOW COULD I THINK ANY OTHER WAY
SHE WOULD LIKE TO RUN AWAY THAT VERY MORNING AND NEVER SEE ANY OF THE OLD FACES AGAIN
BUT I FEEL NOW HOW WEAK MY FAITH IS
UNSEAL THE CLOSED LIPS
SHE HAD BEEN SITTING PERFECTLY STILL LOOKING AT THE SMALL BIT OF CLEAR FIRE IN THE BRIGHT GRATE
BUT HE HAD NO BASKET OF TOOLS AND HE WAS NOT WALKING WITH THE OLD ERECTNESS LOOKING KEENLY ROUND HIM
SHE IS CLOTHED ROUND WITH THICK DARKNESS
SHE NEVER WENT TO SNOWFIELD--SHE TOOK THE COACH TO STONITON BUT I CAN'T LEARN NOTHING OF HER AFTER SHE GOT DOWN FROM THE STONITON COACH WHY YOU DONNA MEAN SHE'S RUN AWAY SAID MARTIN STANDING STILL SO PUZZLED AND BEWILDERED THAT THE FACT DID NOT YET MAKE ITSELF FELT AS A TROUBLE BY HIM
BUT NOW IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE THIRD QUATRAIN OR CHORUS SUNG FORTISSIMO WITH EMPHATIC RAPS OF THE TABLE WHICH GAVE THE EFFECT OF CYMBALS AND DRUM TOGETHER ALICK'S CAN WAS FILLED AND HE WAS BOUND TO EMPTY IT BEFORE THE CHORUS CEASED
NEVERTHELESS AT THIS POINT IN THE CONVERSATION HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF INCREASED DISINCLINATION TO TELL HIS STORY ABOUT HETTY
SING MY LOOVE'S A ROOS WI'OUT A THORN THE AMATORY DAVID WAS A YOUNG MAN OF AN UNCONSCIOUS ABSTRACTED EXPRESSION WHICH WAS DUE PROBABLY TO A SQUINT OF SUPERIOR INTENSITY RATHER THAN TO ANY MENTAL CHARACTERISTIC
NOUGHT UD HOLD HER BUT SHE MUST GO YESTERDAY FORENOON
AND ENCOURAGED BY THIS TOUCH OF TENDERNESS HE WENT ON
NATURE THAT GREAT TRAGIC DRAMATIST KNITS US TOGETHER BY BONE AND MUSCLE AND DIVIDES US BY THE SUBTLER WEB OF OUR BRAINS
SEE I MUST STOP AND EAT A MORSEL
YOU'N GOT ENOUGH TO BEGIN ON AND WE CAN DO A DEAL TOW'RT THE BIT O FURNITURE YOU'LL WANT
SUCH A WOMAN AS THAT BRINGS WITH HER AIRS FROM HEAVEN THAT THE COARSEST FELLOW IS NOT INSENSIBLE TO HERE'S A DELICATE BIT OF WOMANHOOD OR GIRLHOOD COMING TO RECEIVE A PRIZE I SUPPOSE SAID MR GAWAINE
HERE TAKE SOME ALE MY BOY
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANOTHER TURNING TO THE HERMITAGE THAT SHE IS CLOSE AGAINST IT AND THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS ONLY A FEW YARDS FROM HER FULL OF ONE THOUGHT AND A THOUGHT OF WHICH SHE ONLY IS THE OBJECT
NOBODY SHALL EVER SEE THEIR MONEY-BOXES ANY MORE IF THEY DON'T MAKE HASTE AND GO ON TO CHURCH THIS DREADFUL THREAT HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT AND THROUGH THE TWO REMAINING FIELDS THE THREE PAIR OF SMALL LEGS TROTTED ON WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS INTERRUPTION NOTWITHSTANDING A SMALL POND FULL OF TADPOLES ALIAS BULLHEADS WHICH THE LADS LOOKED AT WISTFULLY
I WAS CALLED TO PREACH QUITE SUDDENLY AND SINCE THEN I HAVE NEVER BEEN LEFT IN DOUBT ABOUT THE WORK THAT WAS LAID UPON ME BUT TELL ME THE CIRCUMSTANCES--JUST HOW IT WAS THE VERY DAY YOU BEGAN TO PREACH IT WAS ONE SUNDAY I WALKED WITH BROTHER MARLOWE WHO WAS AN AGED MAN ONE OF THE LOCAL PREACHERS ALL THE WAY TO HETTON-DEEPS--THAT'S A VILLAGE WHERE THE PEOPLE GET THEIR LIVING BY WORKING IN THE LEAD-MINES AND WHERE THERE'S NO CHURCH NOR PREACHER BUT THEY LIVE LIKE SHEEP WITHOUT A SHEPHERD
IT WAS TO ADAM THE TIME THAT A MAN CAN LEAST FORGET IN AFTER-LIFE THE TIME WHEN HE BELIEVES THAT THE FIRST WOMAN HE HAS EVER LOVED BETRAYS BY A SLIGHT SOMETHING--A WORD A TONE A GLANCE THE QUIVERING OF A LIP OR AN EYELID--THAT SHE IS AT LEAST BEGINNING TO LOVE HIM IN RETURN
AND HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO BEAR IT--HE SHOULD BE A FOOL AND GIVE WAY AGAIN
YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU I HAD QUITE GIVEN UP ARGUING THE MATTER WITH HIM--I THOUGHT IT WAS HOPELESS--BUT YESTERDAY MORNING HE ASKED ME TO COME IN HERE TO HIM BEFORE I WENT OUT AND ASTONISHED ME BY SAYING THAT HE HAD DECIDED ON ALL THE NEW ARRANGEMENTS HE SHOULD MAKE IN CONSEQUENCE OF OLD SATCHELL BEING OBLIGED TO LAY BY WORK AND THAT HE INTENDED TO EMPLOY ADAM IN SUPERINTENDING THE WOODS AT A SALARY OF A GUINEA A-WEEK AND THE USE OF A PONY TO BE KEPT HERE
ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN IN IMAGINING HIMSELF WAITED FOR
IT'S TEA-TIME
I DON'T WANT TO LESSEN YOUR INDIGNATION AGAINST ME OR ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING FOR MY SAKE
SHE MUST WANDER ON AND ON AND WAIT FOR A LOWER DEPTH OF DESPAIR TO GIVE HER COURAGE
SHE GOT UP AND WENT TOWARDS THE TABLE
AND THE COUNSELLORS--WHO LOOK AS HARD AS NAILS MOSTLY--I SAW SPARED HIM AS MUCH AS THEY COULD
AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THIS SONG--WHETHER IT CAME IN ITS ACTUAL STATE FROM THE BRAIN OF A SINGLE RHAPSODIST OR WAS GRADUALLY PERFECTED BY A SCHOOL OR SUCCESSION OF RHAPSODISTS I AM IGNORANT
AND THE THING HE DREADED MOST WAS LEST ANY CLOUD SHOULD COME OVER THIS EVENING'S HAPPINESS
MRS BEST'S BEEN TELLIN US AS MISS LYDDY AND MISS IRWINE ULL DANCE AN THE YOUNG SQUIRE ULL PICK MY WIFE FOR HIS FIRST PARTNER T OPEN THE BALL
NO DUST HAS SETTLED ON ONE'S MIND THEN AND IT PRESENTS A CLEAR MIRROR TO THE RAYS OF THINGS
HETTY TURNED PALE AS SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM FOR AN INSTANT AND MET HIS EYES BEFORE THE DANCE CARRIED HIM AWAY
THE SUNDAY SUNSHINE TOO WHICH HAS MORE THAN AUTUMNAL CALMNESS FOR THE WORKING MAN
AND YET SHE LOOKED SO DIMPLED SO CHARMING AS SHE STOOPED DOWN TO PUT THE SOAKED BREAD UNDER THE HEN-COOP THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY ACUTE PERSONAGE INDEED TO SUSPECT HER OF THAT HARDNESS
HE HAD GOOD HOPE THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRMER ON HIS LEGS BY AND BY
WE CAN STILL HOPE SHE IS BUT WHO SAYS SHE IS GUILTY SAID ADAM VIOLENTLY
THEY MAY BE LESS FOR RECOMMENDING HER TO MERCY IF THE VERDICT'S AGAINST HER
AND MR POYSER YOU MUST LET ME TAKE YOU TO MY AUNT FOR SHE CLAIMS YOU AS HER PARTNER THE WIFE'S PALE CHEEK FLUSHED WITH A NERVOUS SENSE OF UNWONTED HONOUR AS ARTHUR LED HER TO THE TOP OF THE ROOM
SHE WILL ALLOW A GENTLEMAN OF SPLENDID PHYSIOGNOMY AND POETIC ASPIRATIONS TO SING WOEFULLY OUT OF TUNE AND NOT GIVE HIM THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF IT
HETTY WAS VISIBLY TREMBLING
BUT LET IT BE TILL I CAN FETCH IT AND SHOW IT YOU
YE SEE THAT DARKISH-BLUE CLOUD THERE UPO THE RIZON--YE KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THE RIZON WHERE THE LAND AND SKY SEEMS TO MEET AYE AYE I SEE THE CLOUD SAID MR POYSER RIZON OR NO RIZON
SHE CAN'T BEAR TO BE SPOKEN TO TO-DAY ANNE'S EYES WERE CLOSED AND HER BROW CONTRACTED AS IF FROM INTENSE PAIN
THE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN A MORE SERIOUS TONE THAN HE HAD INTENDED--IT WOULD QUITE MISLEAD IRWINE--HE WOULD IMAGINE THERE WAS A DEEP PASSION FOR HETTY WHILE THERE WAS NO SUCH THING
BUT OF EVERY PICTURE SHE IS THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN FINE CLOTHES
SHE IS NOT GONE TO HIM
AN SHE MAKES ONE FEEL SAFER WHEN SHE'S I THE HOUSE FOR SHE'S LIKE THE DRIVEN SNOW
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR I MEAN IT'S STUFF AND NONSENSE FOR THE INNOCENT TO CARE ABOUT HER BEING HANGED
DO TOUCH IT UP WITH A TASTEFUL PENCIL AND MAKE BELIEVE IT IS NOT QUITE SUCH A MIXED ENTANGLED AFFAIR
AND ADAM BEDE SHOULD SUPERINTEND ALL THE REPAIRS FOR HE HAD A SHARE IN BURGE'S BUSINESS NOW AND IF HE LIKED ARTHUR WOULD PUT SOME MONEY INTO THE CONCERN AND BUY THE OLD MAN OUT IN ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF STRONG LANGUAGE MINGLED WITH SOOTHING WHO-HO'S WHILE THE LEG WAS EXAMINED
WITH THE HONEST SERVANT WHO WORRIES YOUR SOUL WITH HER ONE FAILING
SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE
THEY SENT HER THE MONEY FOR HER JOURNEY
HE WAS O'ERWROUGHT WITH WORK AND TROUBLE WAKE HIM
WILL YOU AND THE CAPTAIN PLEASE TO WALK INTO THE PARLOUR NO INDEED THANK YOU MRS POYSER SAID THE CAPTAIN LOOKING EAGERLY ROUND THE KITCHEN AS IF HIS EYE WERE SEEKING SOMETHING IT COULD NOT FIND
HOW COULD HE IMAGINE NARROWNESS SELFISHNESS HARDNESS IN HER
I THOUGHT O YOU SOMETIMES AND THOUGHT I'D COME TO YOU FOR I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE CROSS WITH ME AND CRY SHAME ON ME
I'N SEEN NO YOUNG WOMAN THINK
BUT IF A POOR MAN OR WOMAN'S IN TROUBLE AND HAS HARD WORK TO MAKE OUT A LIVING THEY LIKE TO HAVE A LETTER TO TELL EM THEY'VE GOT A FRIEND AS WILL HELP EM
THEY WILL REALLY BE UNDER NO MAN BUT ONE WHOM THEY RESPECT AND LIKE
HETTY DROPPED THE PRETTIEST LITTLE CURTSY AND STOLE A HALF-SHY HALF-COQUETTISH GLANCE AT HIM AS SHE SAID YES THANK YOU SIR AND YOU MUST BRING ALL YOUR CHILDREN YOU KNOW MRS POYSER
ANYBODY MIGHT SIN FOR TWO AS HAD HER AT THEIR ELBOW DINAH SAID TOMMY RUNNING FORWARD TO MEET HER MOTHER SAYS YOU'LL NEVER MARRY ANYBODY BUT A METHODIST CRIPPLE
I'LL BE BACK TO THEE IN A MINUTE POOR LISBETH WAS BUSY PREPARING HER SONS BREAKFAST AND THEIR PORRIDGE WAS ALREADY STEAMING ON THE FIRE
WHAT A CAPITAL THING IT IS THAT THEY SAVED THIS PIECE OF THE OLD ABBEY SAID ARTHUR
IF WE DO WE SHALL FIND IT DIFFERENT
WE'VE PRETTY NIGH ALL ON US KNOWN YOU WHEN YOU WAR A LITTLE UN AN WE'VE NIVER KNOWN ANYTHING ON YOU BUT WHAT WAS GOOD AN HONORABLE
I FELT I'D BEEN TOO HARSH TO MY FATHER WHEN HE WAS GONE FROM ME--I FEEL IT NOW WHEN I THINK OF HIM
WE LOOK AT THE ONE LITTLE WOMAN'S FACE WE LOVE AS WE LOOK AT THE FACE OF OUR MOTHER EARTH AND SEE ALL SORTS OF ANSWERS TO OUR OWN YEARNINGS
MR POYSER HAD NO REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS LEG AND SUSPECTED THAT THE GROWING ABUSE OF TOP-BOOTS AND OTHER FASHIONS TENDING TO DISGUISE THE NETHER LIMBS HAD THEIR ORIGIN IN A PITIABLE DEGENERACY OF THE HUMAN CALF
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
AH YOUR MOTHER LITTLE THOUGHT AS SHE'D HAVE A DAUGHTER JUST CUT OUT AFTER THE VERY PATTERN O JUDITH AND LEAVE HER AN ORPHAN TOO FOR JUDITH TO TAKE CARE ON AND BRING UP WITH A SPOON WHEN SHE WAS IN THE GRAVEYARD AT STONITON
IT WAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STATE OF MIND FROM WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED IN SUCH A MEETING WITH HETTY
AND THE MISSIS HAS GOT ONE OF HER RARE STUFFED CHINES
I MAKE MY OWN BREAD AND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE BATCH AND ANOTHER FROM YEAR'S END TO YEAR'S END
OH DO COME IN WITH ME SHE SAID AS HE WAS GOING TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HER AT THE GATE AND HE COULD NOT RESIST THAT
BUT THIS MONEY WOULD NOT KEEP HER LONG
HOW MUCH MORE WHEN THE OBJECT OF OUR ANGER HAS GONE INTO EVERLASTING SILENCE AND WE HAVE SEEN HIS FACE FOR THE LAST TIME IN THE MEEKNESS OF DEATH
EVERYTHING WAS MANAGED IN THE STINGIEST FASHION
SHE'S SUCH A MATCH AS THE HORSE-FLY IS TO TH HORSE
THE THOUGHT CAME ALL OF A SUDDEN AS I WAS LYING IN THE BED AND IT GOT STRONGER AND STRONGER...I LONGED SO TO GO BACK AGAIN...I COULDN'T BEAR BEING SO LONELY AND COMING TO BEG FOR WANT
HE WOULD NOT MENTION WHAT HE KNEW OF ARTHUR DONNITHORNE'S BEHAVIOUR TO HETTY TILL THERE WAS A CLEAR NECESSITY FOR IT
THAT JOHN STOOD BY WITH QUITE AS MUCH EMOTION AS IF HE HAD BEEN A CUNNINGLY CARVED CRAB-TREE WALKING-STICK AND THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE PRESENTLY REPASSED THE IRON GATES OF THE PLEASURE-GROUND WITHOUT SINGING AS HE WENT
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WEEPING NOW AND WAS VEXED THAT SHE WAS TOO WEAK AND TIRED TO HELP IT
YE MUN AYTHER BE CLEMMED OR FULL I SHOULD THINK SEEIN WHAT TIME O NIGHT IT IS I'M HUNGRY MOTHER SAID SETH SEATING HIMSELF AT THE LITTLE TABLE WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD EVER SINCE IT WAS LIGHT
WHILE THE POYSER PARTY WISELY STRUCK ACROSS THE GRASS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE GREAT TREES BUT NOT OUT OF VIEW OF THE HOUSE-FRONT WITH ITS SLOPING LAWN AND FLOWER-BEDS OR OF THE PRETTY STRIPED MARQUEE AT THE EDGE OF THE LAWN STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH TWO LARGER MARQUEES ON EACH SIDE OF THE OPEN GREEN SPACE WHERE THE GAMES WERE TO BE PLAYED
FOR WHAT HAVE WE GOT EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF US BUT WHAT COMES FROM GOD
IT WAS A PRETTY SCENE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
YOU WON'T SEND ME AWAY
THERE'S NOBODY AT HOME YOU SEE DINAH SAID
THERE'S MAYBE A WORKMAN NOW AN THEN AS ISN'T OVERCLEVER AT'S WORK TAKES TO PREACHIN AN THAT LIKE SETH BEDE
ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM
HE'S SET'S HEART ON THAT HETTY SORREL AS ULL NIVER SAVE A PENNY AN ULL TOSS UP HER HEAD AT'S OLD MOTHER
AND TO LAY BY MONEY FROM DAY TO DAY IN SUCH A TIME WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY IN PRESENT NEED OF ALL THINGS WOULD BE A WANT OF TRUST LIKE THE LAYING UP OF THE MANNA
HETTY FOND OF FINERY AS SHE WAS MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT THE THING HERSELF
SHE CAME IN HERE NOT LONG AGO I DON'T KNOW
BUT IT'S A MATTER AS HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BE SPOKE TO ABOUT AND I CAN ONLY PRAY TO THE LORD TO BLESS AND DIRECT HIM AYE THEE'T ALLAYS READY ENOUGH AT PRAYIN BUT I DONNA SEE AS THEE GETS MUCH WI THY PRAYIN THEE WOTNA GET DOUBLE EARNIN'S O THIS SIDE YULE
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SAW A HOLE UNDER THE NUT-TREE LIKE A LITTLE GRAVE
IT WOULD SERVE HER FOR MANY DAYS MORE OR IT WOULD HELP HER TO GET ON FASTER TO STONYSHIRE WITHIN REACH OF DINAH
SHE LAID IT DOWN
DIDST FIND HIM GREATLY ALTERED SAID DINAH
AND I SAW A WOOD A LITTLE WAY OFF...I THOUGHT THERE'D PERHAPS BE A DITCH OR A POND THERE...AND IT WAS SO EARLY I THOUGHT I COULD HIDE THE CHILD THERE AND GET A LONG WAY OFF BEFORE FOLKS WAS UP
AND MAY HAPPEN YOU'LL THINK ME OVERBOLD TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT AGAIN AFTER WHAT YOU TOLD ME O YOUR MIND LAST SATURDAY
WI THEM THREE GELLS IN THE HOUSE I'D NEED HAVE TWICE THE STRENGTH TO KEEP EM UP TO THEIR WORK
THE CART IS TO SET OFF AT HALF-PAST SEVEN IT MUST BE SAID--THE LAST GOOD-BYE
PERHAPS I'VE GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR IN TAKING NOTICE OF THE PRETTY LITTLE THING AND STEALING A KISS NOW AND THEN
HIS HOPES HAD NEVER RISEN SO HIGH THAT HE HAD DARED TO ASK HER
ALL BROXTON AND ALL HAYSLOPE WERE TO BE AT THE CHASE AND MAKE MERRY THERE IN HONOUR OF TH HEIR
I'M TRAVELLING--NORTH'ARD AND I GOT AWAY FROM THE ROAD INTO THE FIELDS AND WAS OVERTAKEN BY THE DARK
AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR I SAYS FOR I WANTED TO HEAR THE TURN OF HIS TONGUE AS I MIGHT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS A THIS-COUNTRY MAN
YOU LEAN ON ME
AND THOUGH SHE AND HER HUSBAND MIGHT HAVE VIEWED THE SUBJECT DIFFERENTLY IF HETTY HAD BEEN A DAUGHTER OF THEIR OWN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED THE MATCH WITH ADAM FOR A PENNILESS NIECE
HE WONNA BE LONG NOW I RECKON IT WAS THEN PAST NINE BY THE CLOCK WHICH WAS ALWAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE DAYS AND BEFORE IT HAD STRUCK TEN THE LATCH WAS LIFTED AND SETH ENTERED
BUT I MADE HIM WRITE A LETTER TO TELL HETTY HE'D MEANT NOTHING FOR I SAW CLEAR ENOUGH SIR BY SEVERAL THINGS AS I HADN'T UNDERSTOOD AT THE TIME AS HE'D GOT HOLD OF HER HEART AND I THOUGHT SHE'D BELIKE GO ON THINKING OF HIM AND NEVER COME TO LOVE ANOTHER MAN AS WANTED TO MARRY HER
BUT THAT IS OUR TRIAL
AND THERE'S THE COUNSEL THEY'VE GOT FOR HER PUTS A SPOKE IN THE WHEEL WHENEVER HE CAN AND MAKES A DEAL TO DO WITH CROSS-EXAMINING THE WITNESSES AND QUARRELLING WITH THE OTHER LAWYERS
THE GREEN LAY AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE VILLAGE AND FROM IT THE ROAD BRANCHED OFF IN TWO DIRECTIONS ONE LEADING FARTHER UP THE HILL BY THE CHURCH AND THE OTHER WINDING GENTLY DOWN TOWARDS THE VALLEY
I'LL HAPPEN SEE DINAH MORRIS SAFE HOME IF SHE'S WILLING
AN SETH THEE MAY'ST REACH DOWN ADAM'S NEW BIBLE WI TH PICTERS IN AN SHE SHALL READ US A CHAPTER
STILL--IF I HAVE READ RELIGIOUS HISTORY ARIGHT--FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN FOUND IN A DIRECT RATIO WITH A SENSIBILITY TO THE THREE CONCORDS AND IT IS POSSIBLE--THANK HEAVEN!--TO HAVE VERY ERRONEOUS THEORIES AND VERY SUBLIME FEELINGS
HIS HITS I IMAGINE WERE THOSE OF THE FLAIL WHICH FALLS QUITE AT RANDOM BUT NEVERTHELESS SMASHES AN INSECT NOW AND THEN
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED TO SEE YOU TO-MORROW HE PAUSED BUT ADAM SAID NOTHING
SHE WASN'T CHRISTENED TOTTY OH SIR WE CALL HER SADLY OUT OF HER NAME
TEN TO ONE MOST OF THE SMALL SHOPKEEPERS IN THEIR VICINITY SAW NOTHING AT ALL IN THEM
THEY WERE ALONE TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM
SEE HE HAS SOMETHING IN HIS HAND--HE IS HOLDING IT UP AS IF IT WERE A SIGNAL
OTHERS THERE ARE WHO DIE POOR AND NEVER PUT OFF THE WORKMAN'S COAL ON WEEKDAYS
MOREOVER MR CRAIG HAD ALWAYS BEEN FULL OF CIVILITIES TO THE FAMILY AT THE HALL FARM AND MRS POYSER WAS SCRUPULOUS IN DECLARING THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY AGAIN HIM ON'Y IT WAS A PITY HE COULDNA BE HATCHED O'ER AGAIN AN HATCHED DIFFERENT SO ADAM AND SETH WITH THEIR MOTHER BETWEEN THEM WOUND THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE VALLEY AND UP AGAIN TO THE OLD HOUSE WHERE A SADDENED MEMORY HAD TAKEN THE PLACE OF A LONG LONG ANXIETY--WHERE ADAM WOULD NEVER HAVE TO ASK AGAIN AS HE ENTERED WHERE'S FATHER AND THE OTHER FAMILY PARTY WITH MR CRAIG FOR COMPANY WENT BACK TO THE PLEASANT BRIGHT HOUSE-PLACE AT THE HALL FARM--ALL WITH QUIET MINDS EXCEPT HETTY WHO KNEW NOW WHERE ARTHUR WAS GONE BUT WAS ONLY THE MORE PUZZLED AND UNEASY
THE MIRROR IS DOUBTLESS DEFECTIVE THE OUTLINES WILL SOMETIMES BE DISTURBED THE REFLECTION FAINT OR CONFUSED
SETH WAS ALREADY BY HIS SIDE HELPING HIM AND WHEN THEY HAD IT ON THE BANK THE TWO SONS IN THE FIRST MOMENT KNELT AND LOOKED WITH MUTE AWE AT THE GLAZED EYES FORGETTING THAT THERE WAS NEED FOR ACTION--FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THAT THEIR FATHER LAY DEAD BEFORE THEM
AND IF THAT HANDSOME GENEROUS-BLOODED CLERGYMAN THE REV
BUT WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MR IRWINE NOW IF YOU HAD MET HIM THAT JUNE AFTERNOON RIDING ON HIS GREY COB WITH HIS DOGS RUNNING BESIDE HIM--PORTLY UPRIGHT MANLY WITH A GOOD-NATURED SMILE ON HIS FINELY TURNED LIPS AS HE TALKED TO HIS DASHING YOUNG COMPANION ON THE BAY MARE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THAT HOWEVER ILL HE HARMONIZED WITH SOUND THEORIES OF THE CLERICAL OFFICE HE SOMEHOW HARMONIZED EXTREMELY WELL WITH THAT PEACEFUL LANDSCAPE
THEN SHE PUT DOWN HER BRUSH AND COMB AND LOOKED AT HERSELF FOLDING HER ARMS BEFORE HER STILL LIKE THE PICTURE
SHE IS IN A VERY UNHAPPY POSITION--ONE WHICH WILL MAKE IT WORSE FOR YOU TO FIND HER MY POOR FRIEND THAN TO HAVE LOST HER FOR EVER ADAM'S LIPS MOVED TREMULOUSLY BUT NO SOUND CAME
HE KNEW NOTHING OF WEEKDAY SERVICES AND THOUGHT NONE THE WORSE OF THE SUNDAY SERMON IF IT ALLOWED HIM TO SLEEP FROM THE TEXT TO THE BLESSING
I TURN WITHOUT SHRINKING FROM CLOUD-BORNE ANGELS FROM PROPHETS SIBYLS AND HEROIC WARRIORS TO AN OLD WOMAN BENDING OVER HER FLOWER-POT OR EATING HER SOLITARY DINNER WHILE THE NOONDAY LIGHT SOFTENED PERHAPS BY A SCREEN OF LEAVES FALLS ON HER MOB-CAP AND JUST TOUCHES THE RIM OF HER SPINNING-WHEEL AND HER STONE JUG AND ALL THOSE CHEAP COMMON THINGS WHICH ARE THE PRECIOUS NECESSARIES OF LIFE TO HER--OR I TURN TO THAT VILLAGE WEDDING KEPT BETWEEN FOUR BROWN WALLS WHERE AN AWKWARD BRIDEGROOM OPENS THE DANCE WITH A HIGH-SHOULDERED BROAD-FACED BRIDE WHILE ELDERLY AND MIDDLE-AGED FRIENDS LOOK ON WITH VERY IRREGULAR NOSES AND LIPS AND PROBABLY WITH QUART-POTS IN THEIR HANDS BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF UNMISTAKABLE CONTENTMENT AND GOODWILL
THIS IS WHAT I UNDERTAKE TO DO FOR YOU READER
FOR WERE THEY NOT MEN WHO ON ALL THE DAYS OF THE YEAR EXCEPT CHRISTMAS DAY AND SUNDAYS ATE THEIR COLD DINNER IN A MAKESHIFT MANNER UNDER THE HEDGEROWS AND DRANK THEIR BEER OUT OF WOODEN BOTTLES--WITH RELISH CERTAINLY BUT WITH THEIR MOUTHS TOWARDS THE ZENITH AFTER A FASHION MORE ENDURABLE TO DUCKS THAN TO HUMAN BIPEDS
THERE ARE SO MANY OF US AND OUR LOTS ARE SO DIFFERENT WHAT WONDER THAT NATURE'S MOOD IS OFTEN IN HARSH CONTRAST WITH THE GREAT CRISIS OF OUR LIVES
AND IN THE EVENING THE FOOTMAN BROUGHT ME THE ONE POUND THIRTEEN WRAPPED IN PAPER
THE BUTLER LOOKED AT HIM WONDERINGLY AS HE THREW HIMSELF ON A BENCH IN THE PASSAGE AND STARED ABSENTLY AT THE CLOCK ON THE OPPOSITE WALL
YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE
ADAM'S HEART ROSE TO HIS MOUTH
THE AFTERNOON WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE LEADEN SKY WAS DARKENING AS IF THE SUN WERE SETTING BEHIND IT
I COULD PUT UP WI YE I TH HOUSE BETTER NOR WI MOST FOLKS I'LL STAY TILL TO-NIGHT IF YOU'RE WILLING SAID DINAH
THEY WERE ALREADY LIKE A DREAM
HE WAS OF AN IMPRESSIBLE NATURE AND LIVED A GREAT DEAL IN OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS AND FEELINGS CONCERNING HIMSELF
AND I MEAN TO ANNOUNCE THE APPOINTMENT TO THEM AND ASK THEM TO DRINK ADAM'S HEALTH
IT ISN'T FOR YOU AND ME TO LAY PLANS
AND SHE WAS GONE TO HIM
AND WHAT DOES OTHER GOOD NEWS SIGNIFY IF WE HAVEN'T THAT
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO PRETTY SINCE MY YOUNG DAYS
HE ASKED AFTER THEE THE FIRST THING WHEN HE BEGAN TO COME ROUND AND WE COULD TALK TO ONE ANOTHER
SURELY ALL OTHER LEISURE IS HURRY COMPARED WITH A SUNNY WALK THROUGH THE FIELDS FROM AFTERNOON CHURCH"--AS SUCH WALKS USED TO BE IN THOSE OLD LEISURELY TIMES WHEN THE BOAT GLIDING SLEEPILY ALONG THE CANAL WAS THE NEWEST LOCOMOTIVE WONDER
BUT THERE WAS A RESOLUTE AIR OF SELF-RELIANCE ABOUT HER THIS MORNING SO DIFFERENT FROM THE HELPLESS PROSTRATION OF YESTERDAY THAT THE LANDLADY HARDLY KNEW HOW TO MAKE A REMARK THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE PRYING INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS
IT'S A SAD CUT-UP FOR YE I DOUBT ADAM COULD SAY NOTHING
SHE HATES EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE LONGS FOR
THAT HE WAS CONSTANTLY FINDING REASON FOR CALLING AT THE HALL FARM AND ALWAYS WOULD CONTRIVE TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING HER SPEAK TO HIM AND LOOK AT HIM
ARTER SOME SERVICE OR WHAT GOING TO MY BROTHER--HE'S A SOLDIER THERE WELL I'M GOING NO FURDER NOR LEICESTER--AND FUR ENOUGH TOO--BUT I'LL TAKE YOU IF YOU DOOANT MIND BEING A BIT LONG ON THE ROAD
HE HELD ONE HAND THRUST BETWEEN HIS WAISTCOAT BUTTONS AND THE OTHER READY TO TURN THE PAGES AND IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN MANY CHANGES IN HIS FACE
WHY EVERYBODY'S GOIN TO DANCE TO-NIGHT ALL BUT TH OLD SQUIRE AND MRS IRWINE
SHE WOULD BE JEALOUS OF ANY WIFE HE MIGHT CHOOSE AND SHE HAD SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST HETTY--PERHAPS FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT SHE SUSPECTED HETTY TO BE THE WOMAN HE HAD CHOSEN
THEY'VE NO WAY O WORKING IT OFF AND THE NEW SPRING BRINGS NO NEW SHOOTS OUT ON THE WITHERED TREE AH YOU'VE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE AND VEXATION IN YOUR LIFE ADAM
UNDERNEATH THE MAPLE THERE WAS A SMALL CART WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE WHEELWRIGHT'S TO SERVE AS A PULPIT AND ROUND THIS A COUPLE OF BENCHES AND A FEW CHAIRS HAD BEEN PLACED
ADAM I CONFESS WAS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE INFLUENCE OF RANK AND QUITE READY TO GIVE AN EXTRA AMOUNT OF RESPECT TO EVERY ONE WHO HAD MORE ADVANTAGES THAN HIMSELF NOT BEING A PHILOSOPHER OR A PROLETAIRE WITH DEMOCRATIC IDEAS BUT SIMPLY A STOUT-LIMBED CLEVER CARPENTER WITH A LARGE FUND OF REVERENCE IN HIS NATURE WHICH INCLINED HIM TO ADMIT ALL ESTABLISHED CLAIMS UNLESS HE SAW VERY CLEAR GROUNDS FOR QUESTIONING THEM
I'LL PAY YOU FOR IT AW SAID THE BIG FELLOW WITH THAT SLOWLY DAWNING SMILE WHICH BELONGS TO HEAVY FACES I CAN TAKE Y UP FAWST ENOUGH WI'OUT BEIN PAID FOR'T IF YOU DOOANT MIND LYIN A BIT CLOSISH A-TOP O THE WOOL-PACKS
BUT HETTY DID NOT SEE HIM
BUT SHE SPOKE IN A QUIET LOW VOICE
HE HAS THE SAME TYPE OF FEATURES THE SAME HUE OF HAIR AND COMPLEXION
WHAT DID HE MEAN
THAT WAS A RARE IMPULSE IN HIM MUCH AS THE BROTHERS LOVED EACH OTHER
THE VOICE THAT TOLD HER TO GO TO HETTY SEEMED NO STRONGER THAN THE OTHER VOICE WHICH SAID THAT HETTY WAS WEARY AND THAT GOING TO HER NOW IN AN UNSEASONABLE MOMENT WOULD ONLY TEND TO CLOSE HER HEART MORE OBSTINATELY
HE HAS SHOWED US WHAT GOD'S HEART IS WHAT ARE HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS US
THEY'VE NEVER BEEN TO LOOK AT MY POULTRY THIS LONG WHILE AND I'VE GOT SOME BEAUTIFUL SPECKLED CHICKENS BLACK AND WHITE AS MISS KATE MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE SOME OF AMONGST HERS WELL I'LL TELL HER
FIRST THAT TOM HAZELOW HIS COUSIN COULD READ ANYTHING RIGHT OFF WHETHER IT WAS PRINT OR WRITING AND TOM HAD SENT HIM A LETTER FROM TWENTY MILES OFF SAYING HOW HE WAS PROSPERING IN THE WORLD AND HAD GOT AN OVERLOOKER'S PLACE
LOOK UPON HER WITH THY FACE OF LOVE AND SORROW THAT THOU DIDST TURN ON HIM WHO DENIED THEE AND MELT HER HARD HEART
AND HIM A GENTLEMAN BORN AND'S GOT A MOTHER LIKE A PICTER
THIS PICTURE HAD ONE STRONG ASSOCIATION IN LISBETH'S MEMORY FOR SHE HAD BEEN REMINDED OF IT WHEN SHE FIRST SAW DINAH AND ADAM HAD NO SOONER TURNED THE PAGE AND LIFTED THE BOOK SIDEWAYS THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK AT THE ANGEL THAN SHE SAID THAT'S HER--THAT'S DINAH ADAM SMILED AND LOOKING MORE INTENTLY AT THE ANGEL'S FACE SAID IT IS A BIT LIKE HER
JESUS THOU ART IN THE MIDST OF US AND THOU KNOWEST ALL MEN
THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING HE WOULD NOT RATHER HAVE LOST THAN THE TWO-FEET RULER WHICH HE ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKET
BUT YOU'LL GIVE IN THAT IT'S NO BUSINESS O MINE TO BE BUILDING ON CHANCES THAT MAY NEVER HAPPEN
HE ONLY READ ONE NEWSPAPER INNOCENT OF LEADERS AND WAS FREE FROM THAT PERIODICITY OF SENSATIONS WHICH WE CALL POST-TIME
HE COULD SEE THERE WAS A LARGE BASKET AT THE END OF THE ROW
THEY SPAT UPON HIM AND BUFFETED HIM THEY SCOURGED HIM THEY MOCKED HIM THEY LAID THE HEAVY CROSS ON HIS BRUISED SHOULDERS
THE THIRD BEGINNER WAS A MUCH MORE PROMISING PUPIL
BUT IF I'D GOT ANY OTHER WOMAN BESIDES VIXEN IN THE HOUSE I MUST PRAY TO THE LORD EVERY BAKING TO GIVE ME PATIENCE IF THE BREAD TURNED OUT HEAVY
BUT THE FURNITURE THOUGH ORIGINALLY OF AN EXPENSIVE SORT IS OLD AND SCANTY AND THERE IS NO DRAPERY ABOUT THE WINDOW
AT LAST IT SEEMED AS IF IN HER YEARNING DESIRE TO RECLAIM THE LOST SHEEP SHE COULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY ADDRESSING HER HEARERS AS A BODY
BUT THEN IT WAS THE ONLY RIGHT THING TO DO
IF A WOMAN'S YOUNG AND PRETTY I THINK YOU CAN SEE HER GOOD LOOKS ALL THE BETTER FOR HER BEING PLAIN DRESSED
THE STILLNESS WAS LESS INTENSE UNTIL THE JUDGE PUT ON HIS BLACK CAP AND THE CHAPLAIN IN HIS CANONICALS WAS OBSERVED BEHIND HIM
ARTHUR PUT HIS HAND UP TO HIS WAISTCOAT BUTTONS AND WHEN ADAM HAD UNBUTTONED IT HE TOOK A LONGER BREATH
THEY SHRINK BY AN UNGOVERNABLE INSTINCT AS THEY WOULD SHRINK FROM LACERATION
THEY MOVED AGAIN AND HE WHISPERED TELL ME SHE HAS BEEN ARRESTED...SHE IS IN PRISON IT WAS AS IF AN INSULTING BLOW HAD BROUGHT BACK THE SPIRIT OF RESISTANCE INTO ADAM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FELT TILL I SAW THE BABY WAS GONE
BUT NOW HE IS DEAD WHEREFORE SHOULD I FAST
THE SMART'S BAD FOR YOU TO BEAR NOW
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY
SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
GOOD GOD
GOOD GOD
IT'LL DO THEE GOOD
I WANT A GREAT DEAL OF THOSE FEELINGS FOR MY EVERY-DAY FELLOW-MEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE FEW IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE GREAT MULTITUDE WHOSE FACES I KNOW WHOSE HANDS I TOUCH FOR WHOM I HAVE TO MAKE WAY WITH KINDLY COURTESY
IT WAS HIS LARGE-HEARTED INDULGENCE THAT MADE HIM IGNORE HIS MOTHER'S HARDNESS TOWARDS HER DAUGHTERS WHICH WAS THE MORE STRIKING FROM ITS CONTRAST WITH HER DOTING FONDNESS TOWARDS HIMSELF
THEY MINGLE AS EASILY AS TWO BROOKLETS THAT ASK FOR NOTHING BUT TO ENTWINE THEMSELVES AND RIPPLE WITH EVER-INTERLACING CURVES IN THE LEAFIEST HIDING-PLACES
I WONNA HA NO TAY
IT'S CUT ME A GOOD DEAL DINAH ADAM SAID AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE WALKING ON
BUT I COULD NOT ADVISE HIM TO SEE YOU ADAM
THEY WERE MUCH QUOTED AT SHEEP-SHEARING AND HAYMAKING TIMES BUT I REFRAIN FROM RECORDING THEM HERE LEST TOM'S WIT SHOULD PROVE TO BE LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER BYGONE JESTERS EMINENT IN THEIR DAY--RATHER OF A TEMPORARY NATURE NOT DEALING WITH THE DEEPER AND MORE LASTING RELATIONS OF THINGS
THERE'S BARTLE MASSEY COMIN AN HAPPEN CRAIG
ITS INTERCHANGE OF BESEECHING CRIES FOR HELP WITH OUTBURSTS OF FAITH AND PRAISE ITS RECURRENT RESPONSES AND THE FAMILIAR RHYTHM OF ITS COLLECTS SEEMED TO SPEAK FOR HIM AS NO OTHER FORM OF WORSHIP COULD HAVE DONE
HE SHOULD HAVE TO GO AWAY IN A FEW WEEKS AND THE POOR LITTLE THING WOULD BE MISERABLE
AND JESUS WHO STANDS READY TO HELP YOU NOW WON'T HELP YOU THEN
IT SEEMED SO FOR AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER JONATHAN BURGE FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE ADAM HAD AT LAST MADE UP HIS MIND TO OFFER HIM A SHARE IN THE BUSINESS WITHOUT FURTHER CONDITION THAN THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO GIVE HIS ENERGIES TO IT AND RENOUNCE ALL THOUGHT OF HAVING A SEPARATE BUSINESS OF HIS OWN
AND THE NEXT TIME HE SAW HER SHE WAS MORE LIVELY THAN USUAL
I KNEW YOU WERE NOT IN BED MY DEAR SHE SAID IN HER SWEET CLEAR VOICE WHICH WAS IRRITATING TO HETTY MINGLING WITH HER OWN PEEVISH VEXATION LIKE MUSIC WITH JANGLING CHAINS FOR I HEARD YOU MOVING
THE MOMENT HE APPEARED AT THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND A FAINT WHIMPERING BEGAN IN THE CHIMNEY-CORNER AND A BROWN-AND-TAN-COLOURED BITCH OF THAT WISE-LOOKING BREED WITH SHORT LEGS AND LONG BODY KNOWN TO AN UNMECHANICAL GENERATION AS TURNSPITS CAME CREEPING ALONG THE FLOOR WAGGING HER TAIL AND HESITATING AT EVERY OTHER STEP AS IF HER AFFECTIONS WERE PAINFULLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE HAMPER IN THE CHIMNEY-CORNER AND THE MASTER WHOM SHE COULD NOT LEAVE WITHOUT A GREETING
THEN IT DEEPENED AGAIN BEFORE THE CRIER HAD HAD TIME TO COMMAND SILENCE
SUPPOSE SHE WERE TO GO TO DINAH AND ASK HER TO HELP HER
HE LEANED TOWARDS HER AND TOOK HER HAND AS HE SAID
THERE'S ONE THING IN THE LETTER CUT ME A GOOD DEAL
INDEED HE HAD BEEN ALREADY A LITTLE SHAKEN IN HIS RESOLUTION BY A BROTHER METHODIST WHO ASSURED HIM THAT THE LETTER WAS A MERE OBSTRUCTION TO THE SPIRIT AND EXPRESSED A FEAR THAT BRIMSTONE WAS TOO EAGER FOR THE KNOWLEDGE THAT PUFFETH UP
HE HAS CALLED ME TO SPEAK HIS WORD AND HE HAS GREATLY OWNED MY WORK
AND THEN ASK HIMSELF HOW MUCH MONEY HE'D GET IN A DAY AT THAT RATE
IT'S MY BELIEF HER HEART'S AS HARD AS A PEBBLE NAY NAY SAID MR POYSER THEE MUSTN'T JUDGE HETTY TOO HARD
THERE IS A STAMP OF UNITY OF INDIVIDUAL GENIUS UPON IT WHICH INCLINES ME TO THE FORMER HYPOTHESIS THOUGH I AM NOT BLIND TO THE CONSIDERATION THAT THIS UNITY MAY RATHER HAVE ARISEN FROM THAT CONSENSUS OF MANY MINDS WHICH WAS A CONDITION OF PRIMITIVE THOUGHT FOREIGN TO OUR MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS
BE AS KIND TO HIM AS YOU CAN MOTHER AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO VEX HIM EH WHAT DOST TALK O MY VEXIN HIM
SHE HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE FOR A PUBLIC BECAUSE THERE WAS A FIGURE AGAINST THE DOOR
IT WAS ALL OF A PIECE WITH THE SAD CONFUSION OF HER MIND--THAT CONFUSION WHICH BELONGS TO THE FIRST HOURS OF A SUDDEN SORROW WHEN THE POOR HUMAN SOUL IS LIKE ONE WHO HAS BEEN DEPOSITED SLEEPING AMONG THE RUINS OF A VAST CITY AND WAKES UP IN DREARY AMAZEMENT NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT IS THE GROWING OR THE DYING DAY--NOT KNOWING WHY AND WHENCE CAME THIS ILLIMITABLE SCENE OF DESOLATION OR WHY HE TOO FINDS HIMSELF DESOLATE IN THE MIDST OF IT
FOR AS HER COUSIN WIRY BEN WHO STOOD NEAR HER JUDICIOUSLY SUGGESTED DINAH WAS NOT GOING AWAY AND IF BESSY WAS IN LOW SPIRITS THE BEST THING FOR HER TO DO WAS TO FOLLOW DINAH'S EXAMPLE AND MARRY AN HONEST FELLOW WHO WAS READY TO HAVE HER
I THINK IT IS THE MOST CHARMING ROOM I KNOW
SHE WILL NOT CONFESS HER NAME OR WHERE SHE COMES FROM
WOOED FROM DAY TO DAY BY THE CHANGING HOURS BUT RESPONDING WITH NO CHANGE IN THEMSELVES--LEFT FOR EVER GRIM AND SULLEN AFTER THE FLUSH OF MORNING THE WINGED GLEAMS OF THE APRIL NOONDAY THE PARTING CRIMSON GLORY OF THE RIPENING SUMMER SUN
NATURE NEVER MAKES A FERRET IN THE SHAPE OF A MASTIFF
UPON MY WORD IT'S A PRETTY SIGHT SAID THE OLD LADY IN HER DEEP VOICE WHEN SHE WAS SEATED AND LOOKED ROUND ON THE BRIGHT SCENE WITH ITS DARK-GREEN BACKGROUND
WILL YOU PROMISE ME YOUR HAND FOR TWO DANCES MISS HETTY
ARTHUR'S CHEEKS EVEN BURNED IN MINGLED SHAME AND IRRITATION AT THE THOUGHT
MR RANN WAS INWARDLY MAINTAINING THE DIGNITY OF THE CHURCH IN THE FACE OF THIS SCANDALOUS IRRUPTION OF METHODISM AND AS THAT DIGNITY WAS BOUND UP WITH HIS OWN SONOROUS UTTERANCE OF THE RESPONSES HIS ARGUMENT NATURALLY SUGGESTED A QUOTATION FROM THE PSALM HE HAD READ THE LAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON
AN THE MOON LIES LIKE A BOAT THERE DOST SEE
AND SHE MAY DIE UNDER IT AND NEVER KNOW COMFORT ANY MORE AH SIR SAID ADAM FOR THE FIRST TIME FEELING HIS OWN PAIN MERGED IN SYMPATHY FOR ARTHUR YOU AND ME'LL OFTEN BE THINKING O THE SAME THING WHEN WE'RE A LONG WAY OFF ONE ANOTHER
WE COULD ONLY SEE THE THINGS HE HAD MADE
AND THOUGH IT WAS PLEASANT TO LAY DOWN THE LAW TO A STUPID NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD NO NOTION HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF HIS FARM IT WAS ALSO AN AGREEABLE VARIETY TO LEARN SOMETHING FROM A CLEVER FELLOW LIKE ADAM BEDE
AND I'VE TEN TIMES THE PLEASURE I SEEING AFTER THE WORK WHEN I'VE MADE THE PLAN MYSELF MR POYSER LISTENED WITH AN ADMIRING INTEREST TO ADAM'S DISCOURSE ON BUILDING BUT PERHAPS IT SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT THE BUILDING OF HIS CORN-RICK HAD BEEN PROCEEDING A LITTLE TOO LONG WITHOUT THE CONTROL OF THE MASTER'S EYE FOR WHEN ADAM HAD DONE SPEAKING HE GOT UP AND SAID WELL LAD I'LL BID YOU GOOD-BYE NOW FOR I'M OFF TO THE RICK-YARD AGAIN ADAM ROSE TOO FOR HE SAW DINAH ENTERING WITH HER BONNET ON AND A LITTLE BASKET IN HER HAND PRECEDED BY TOTTY
ARTHUR WAS AT WINDSOR AND SHE WOULD GO TO HIM
HOW COULD HETTY HAVE AN ACCEPTED LOVER QUITE UNKNOWN TO HIM
BESIDES HE HAD THAT MENTAL COMBINATION WHICH IS AT ONCE HUMBLE IN THE REGION OF MYSTERY AND KEEN IN THE REGION OF KNOWLEDGE
THAT'S THE WAY WITH THESE WOMEN--THEY'VE GOT NO HEAD-PIECES TO NOURISH AND SO THEIR FOOD ALL RUNS EITHER TO FAT OR TO BRATS HE BROUGHT OUT OF THE PANTRY A DISH OF SCRAPS WHICH VIXEN AT ONCE FIXED HER EYES ON AND JUMPED OUT OF HER HAMPER TO LICK UP WITH THE UTMOST DISPATCH
SHE MUST HIDE HERSELF WHERE NO FAMILIAR EYES COULD DETECT HER
AND MANY A GOOD FELLOW THROUGH A DISASTROUS COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES HAS UNDERGONE A LIKE BETRAYAL
TOTTY SMILED DOWN COMPLACENTLY FROM HER SECURE HEIGHT AND PLEASANT WAS THE SIGHT TO THE MOTHER'S EYES AS SHE STOOD AT THE HOUSE DOOR AND SAW ADAM COMING WITH HIS SMALL BURDEN
THEY ARE ALL LAID ON THE WRITING-TABLE IN YOUR DRESSING-ROOM ON ENTERING THE SMALL ANTEROOM WHICH WAS CALLED A DRESSING-ROOM BUT WHICH ARTHUR REALLY USED ONLY TO LOUNGE AND WRITE IN HE JUST CAST HIS EYES ON THE WRITING-TABLE AND SAW THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL LETTERS AND PACKETS LYING THERE
IT WAS THE AIR ON WHICH THEY THRIVED THE BEST AND GREW STRONG
BUT YET AS YOU HAVE SEEN OF A SUFFICIENTLY SUBTLE MORAL FIBRE TO HAVE AN UNWEARYING TENDERNESS FOR OBSCURE AND MONOTONOUS SUFFERING
THE CAPTAIN'S COMING OF AGE NOW--YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS I DO--AND IT'S TO BE EXPECTED HE'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE VOICE IN THINGS
THE SUPERIOR REFINEMENT OF HIS FACE WAS MUCH MORE STRIKING THAN THAT OF ARTHUR'S WHEN SEEN IN COMPARISON WITH THE PEOPLE ROUND THEM
THERE IS RARELY METAL ENOUGH THERE TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON
MY MAN ISNA COME HOME FROM MEETING ADAM SAT DOWN PATIENTLY NOT LIKING TO HURRY THE SHAKING OLD WOMAN WITH QUESTIONS BUT LOOKING EAGERLY TOWARDS THE NARROW TWISTING STAIRS IN ONE CORNER FOR HE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE HETTY MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIS VOICE AND WOULD COME DOWN THEM
HE THREW IT DOWN AT LAST AND CLENCHED HIS FIST
ON ONE SIDE THERE WAS THE BROAD-SHOULDERED LARGE-FEATURED HARDY OLD WOMAN IN HER BLUE JACKET AND BUFF KERCHIEF WITH HER DIM-EYED ANXIOUS LOOKS TURNED CONTINUALLY ON THE LILY FACE AND THE SLIGHT FORM IN THE BLACK DRESS THAT WERE EITHER MOVING LIGHTLY ABOUT IN HELPFUL ACTIVITY OR SEATED CLOSE BY THE OLD WOMAN'S ARM-CHAIR HOLDING HER WITHERED HAND WITH EYES LIFTED UP TOWARDS HER TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE WHICH LISBETH UNDERSTOOD FAR BETTER THAN THE BIBLE OR THE HYMN-BOOK
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY BUT FLUCTUATING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HETTY'S FEELINGS
ON ALICK THE SHEPHERD IN HIS NEW SMOCK-FROCK TAKING AN UNEASY SIESTA HALF-SITTING HALF-STANDING ON THE GRANARY STEPS
AN THEIR MOTHER'S TOOK ON SO AN WANTS EM TO MAKE SURE O THE SPOT FOR FEAR SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD TAKE IT
NOT TO MENTION THAT I'M ALWAYS SPENDING MORE THAN I CAN AFFORD IN BRICKS AND MORTAR SO THAT I GET SAVAGE AT A LAME BEGGAR WHEN HE ASKS ME FOR SIXPENCE
YOU MAY SEE HER ROOM HERE SHE WENT ON OPENING A DOOR AND NOT NOTICING THE EFFECT OF HER WORDS ON ADAM
AS HE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE SLOPE AN ELDERLY HORSEMAN WITH HIS PORTMANTEAU STRAPPED BEHIND HIM STOPPED HIS HORSE WHEN ADAM HAD PASSED HIM AND TURNED ROUND TO HAVE ANOTHER LONG LOOK AT THE STALWART WORKMAN IN PAPER CAP LEATHER BREECHES AND DARK-BLUE WORSTED STOCKINGS
SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HETTY ONE MOMENT
I WISH TO GO IN ALONE AS YOU LIKE SAID THE JAILER TURNING THE HARSH KEY IN THE LOCK AND OPENING THE DOOR WIDE ENOUGH TO ADMIT DINAH
BUT I'VE HEARED AS THERE'S NO HOLDING THESE METHODISSES WHEN THE MAGGIT'S ONCE GOT I THEIR HEAD
THE CANDID ARTHUR HAD BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A POSITION IN WHICH SUCCESSFUL LYING WAS HIS ONLY HOPE
I PITY HIM IN PROPORTION TO HIS STRUGGLES FOR THEY FORESHADOW THE INWARD SUFFERING WHICH IS THE WORST FORM OF NEMESIS
SHE SET DOWN HER BASKET AND THEN SANK DOWN HERSELF ON THE GRASS TREMBLING
CHAPTER XXVIII A DILEMMA IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES MEASURED BY THE CLOCK--THOUGH ADAM ALWAYS THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN A LONG WHILE--BEFORE HE PERCEIVED A GLEAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN ARTHUR'S FACE AND A SLIGHT SHIVER THROUGH HIS FRAME
THERE'S MESTER HOLDSWORTH HAS MORE LAND NOR ANYBODY ELSE ON TH ESTATE WELL SAID MR POYSER SUPPOSE WE SAY THE MAN WI THE FOULEST LAND SHALL SIT AT TOP
ADAM WAS USED TO HEAR HIM TALK IN THIS WAY BUT HAD NEVER LEARNED SO MUCH OF BARTLE'S PAST LIFE AS TO KNOW WHETHER HIS VIEW OF MARRIED COMFORT WAS FOUNDED ON EXPERIENCE
I FELT I MUST DO IT...I DIDN'T KNOW HOW...I THOUGHT I'D FIND A POOL IF I COULD LIKE THAT OTHER IN THE CORNER OF THE FIELD IN THE DARK
THERE WERE SHEEP IN THE NEXT FIELD AND SHE STARTLED A GROUP AS SHE SET DOWN HER BASKET AND GOT OVER THE STILE
BUT THE NEXT MINUTE HE HAD RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM STILL CLUTCHING THE LETTER--HE WAS HURRYING ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE HALL
HIS SPEECH HAD USUALLY SOMETHING OF A SNARL IN IT AND HIS BROAD-SHOULDERED ASPECT SOMETHING OF THE BULL-DOG EXPRESSION--"DON'T YOU MEDDLE WITH ME AND I WON'T MEDDLE WITH YOU BUT HE WAS HONEST EVEN TO THE SPLITTING OF AN OAT-GRAIN RATHER THAN HE WOULD TAKE BEYOND HIS ACKNOWLEDGED SHARE AND AS CLOSE-FISTED WITH HIS MASTER'S PROPERTY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HIS OWN--THROWING VERY SMALL HANDFULS OF DAMAGED BARLEY TO THE CHICKENS BECAUSE A LARGE HANDFUL AFFECTED HIS IMAGINATION PAINFULLY WITH A SENSE OF PROFUSION
I KNOW THEE COULDST DO BETTER WI'OUT ME FOR THEE COULDST GO WHERE THEE LIKEDST AN MARRY THEM AS THEE LIKEDST
HE WAS NOTHING IF NOT GOOD-NATURED
AND SHE CRIED OUT WHEN SHE SAW US BUT SHE NEVER OFFERED TO MOVE
SUCH A PRETTY POCKET
THERE IS QUITE A CONCERT OF NOISES
BESIDES HIS ATTENTION WAS CLAIMED BY GREETINGS AND THERE REMAINED THE HOPE THAT DINAH WAS IN THE HOUSE THOUGH PERHAPS DISINCLINED TO FESTIVITIES ON THE EVE OF HER DEPARTURE
MARTIN POYSER HELD MR CRAIG IN HONOUR AS A MAN WHO KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND WHO HAD GREAT LIGHTS CONCERNING SOILS AND COMPOST
SETH SET OUT TO THE VILLAGE AND ADAM BEGAN HIS WORK ON THE COFFIN
SENT A MESSENGER TO AWAIT HIM AT LIVERPOOL YES RALPH WAS GONE BEFORE THE NEWS WAS BROUGHT TO US
BUT HER STOLID FACE SHOWED NOTHING OF THIS MATERNAL DELIGHT ANY MORE THAN A BROWN EARTHENWARE PITCHER WILL SHOW THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP WITHIN IT
AND JUST AS I WAS STOOPING AND LAYING DOWN THE STAKES I SAW SOMETHING ODD AND ROUND AND WHITISH LYING ON THE GROUND UNDER A NUT-BUSH BY THE SIDE OF ME
IF YOU HAD STUCK TO YOUR BOOKS WELL YOU RASCAL I SHOULD HAVE HAD A PLEASANTER PROSPECT BEFORE ME
DO YOU FEEL ANY HURT INSIDE SIR ADAM ASKED AGAIN NO--NO HURT SAID ARTHUR STILL FAINTLY BUT RATHER DONE UP AFTER A WHILE HE SAID I SUPPOSE I FAINTED AWAY WHEN YOU KNOCKED ME DOWN YES SIR THANK GOD SAID ADAM
TO-DAY HOWEVER MRS POYSER GAVE BUT A DIVIDED ATTENTION TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE COWS FOR SHE WAS IN EAGER DISCUSSION WITH DINAH WHO WAS STITCHING MR POYSER'S SHIRT-COLLARS AND HAD BORNE PATIENTLY TO HAVE HER THREAD BROKEN THREE TIMES BY TOTTY PULLING AT HER ARM WITH A SUDDEN INSISTENCE THAT SHE SHOULD LOOK AT BABY THAT IS AT A LARGE WOODEN DOLL WITH NO LEGS AND A LONG SKIRT WHOSE BALD HEAD TOTTY SEATED IN HER SMALL CHAIR AT DINAH'S SIDE WAS CARESSING AND PRESSING TO HER FAT CHEEK WITH MUCH FERVOUR
HE CONSOLED HIMSELF AFTER A TIME WITH REFLECTING THAT SINCE ADAM'S TROUBLE LISBETH HAD BEEN VERY TIMID ABOUT SPEAKING TO HIM ON MATTERS OF FEELING AND THAT SHE WOULD HARDLY DARE TO APPROACH THIS TENDEREST OF ALL SUBJECTS
SHE IS ALMOST A CHILD HERSELF AND THE LITTLE PINK ROUND THINGS WILL HANG ABOUT HER LIKE FLORETS ROUND THE CENTRAL FLOWER
HE FELT HIS OLD SEVERITY RETURNING AS HE SAID THE TIME'S PAST FOR THAT SIR
THEY WALKED ALONG WITH BEATING HEARTS TILL THEY CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE GATE AT THE END OF THE WOOD
AND SEE THAT MY MARE IS SADDLED AT HALF-PAST EIGHT AND TELL MY GRANDFATHER WHEN HE'S DOWN THAT I'M BETTER THIS MORNING AND AM GONE FOR A RIDE HE HAD BEEN AWAKE AN HOUR AND COULD REST IN BED NO LONGER
HE SHALL MANAGE MY WOODS FOR ME FOR HE SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER NOTION OF THOSE THINGS THAN ANY MAN I EVER MET WITH
AN HETTY TOO--SHE NEVER HAD SUCH A PARTNER BEFORE--A FINE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN REG'MENTALS
SHE WISHED ALL THE OLD TROUBLES BACK AGAIN FOR THEN IT MATTERED MORE TO ADAM WHAT HIS MOTHER SAID AND DID
I KNOW BETTER NOR YOU HETTY BURST OUT
DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN'T LOVE ME DINAH
BUT I'D THOUGHT BETTER ON HER"--HE ADDED SHAKING HIS HEAD SLOWLY AND SADLY--"I'D THOUGHT BETTER ON HER NOR TO LOOK FOR THIS AFTER SHE'D GI'EN Y HER WORD AN EVERYTHING BEEN GOT READY ADAM HAD THE STRONGEST MOTIVES FOR ENCOURAGING THIS SUPPOSITION IN MR POYSER AND HE EVEN TRIED TO BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE TRUE
SHE'S A BIT CROSS WI THE DOGS WHEN THEY OFFER TO COME IN TH HOUSE BUT IF THEY DEPENDED ON HER SHE'D TAKE CARE AND HAVE EM WELL FED
BUT DINAH BEGAN TO SPEAK
IF I'D KNOWN VIXEN WAS A WOMAN I'D NEVER HAVE HELD THE BOYS FROM DROWNING HER
I SEEM AS IF I'D BEEN MEASURING MY WORK FROM A FALSE LINE AND HAD GOT IT ALL TO MEASURE OVER AGAIN BUT THE QUESTION ABOUT DELIVERING THE LETTER TO HETTY SOON ABSORBED ADAM'S THOUGHTS
NOT THAT ARTHUR HAD BEEN AT EASE BEFORE ADAM'S DISCOVERY
HERE GYP HE ADDED TAKING SOME COLD POTATO FROM THE TABLE AND RUBBING THE ROUGH GREY HEAD THAT LOOKED UP TOWARDS HIM
BUT THE ELDERLY CLERK AT THE OFFICE TOUCHED BY HER PRETTY ANXIOUS FACE WROTE DOWN FOR HER THE NAMES OF THE CHIEF PLACES SHE MUST PASS THROUGH
YOU TURN IT O'ER AN O'ER WI YOUR FORK AN DON'T EAT IT AFTER ALL
SURELY NOWHERE ELSE COULD AN OAK CLOCK-CASE AND AN OAK TABLE HAVE GOT TO SUCH A POLISH BY THE HAND
BUT I'M AFRAID SHE SPEAKS WITHOUT BOOK
GOD BLESS YOU THE HANDS WERE CLASPED ONCE MORE AND ADAM LEFT THE HERMITAGE FEELING THAT SORROW WAS MORE BEARABLE NOW HATRED WAS GONE
NOW HIS REAL LIFE WAS BEGINNING
AND IT WILL BE KNOWN--IT SHALL BE MADE KNOWN THAT BOTH YOU AND THE POYSERS STAYED AT MY ENTREATY
ESPECIALLY AS I HAD ONLY A LIMITED SUM AFTER ALL
IT'S A PITY BUT YOU'D SIT IT OUT SAID MARTIN POYSER
FOR IT IS AT SUCH PERIODS THAT THE SENSE OF OUR LIVES HAVING VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE RELATIONS BEYOND ANY OF WHICH EITHER OUR PRESENT OR PROSPECTIVE SELF IS THE CENTRE GROWS LIKE A MUSCLE THAT WE ARE OBLIGED TO LEAN ON AND EXERT
IF SHE SAW HE BORE HER NO ILL WILL FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE TO HIM SHE MIGHT OPEN HER HEART TO HIM
THEY PAUSED FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE A SMALL FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE OF BROXTON
THAT WAS SETH BEDE
I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THEM AS ARE I THE PLACE O YOUR PARENTS FOR THAT MIGHT BRING WORSE TROUBLE THAN'S NEEDFUL ADAM'S WORDS RELIEVED ONE OF HETTY'S FEARS BUT THEY ALSO CARRIED A MEANING WHICH SICKENED HER WITH A STRENGTHENED FOREBODING
BUT DINAH DID NOT LOOK AT HIM--IT WAS EASY FOR HER TO AVOID LOOKING AT THE TALL MAN--AND WHEN AT LAST THERE WAS NO MORE DUSTING TO BE DONE AND NO FURTHER EXCUSE FOR HIM TO LINGER NEAR HER HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND SAID IN RATHER A PLEADING TONE DINAH YOU'RE NOT DISPLEASED WITH ME FOR ANYTHING ARE YOU
SHE'S MORE FIDGETY NOR USUAL NOW
HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE THAT HE MIGHT ASK WHERE SHE WAS GONE TO-DAY
AND HE BEHAVED AS MUCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN TO THE FARMERS AND TH OLD WOMEN AND THE LABOURERS AS HE DID TO THE GENTRY
BUT I WISH FOR THY OWN SAKE THEE'DST BE MORE CONTENTED TO LET ME DO WHAT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO
ADAM HAD NEVER BEEN UNABLE TO JOIN IN A PSALM BEFORE
AND APART FROM THAT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING HE COULD GIVE TOWARDS WHICH SHE LOOKED WITH LONGING AND AMBITION
THE EXCITING INFLUENCE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HEIGHTENED AT LAST BY DINAH'S UNEXPECTED PRESENCE HAD NOT BEEN COUNTERACTED BY ANY BODILY WEARINESS FOR HE HAD NOT DONE HIS ORDINARY AMOUNT OF HARD WORK
THE NEWS OF HIS GRANDFATHER'S DEATH WOULD BRING HIM AS SOON AS HE COULD POSSIBLY COME
BUT THOUGH MICHAELMAS WAS COME MR THURLE THAT DESIRABLE TENANT DID NOT COME TO THE CHASE FARM AND THE OLD SQUIRE AFTER ALL HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT IN A NEW BAILIFF
ADAM WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES MUST NOT INTERFERE WITH THAT SACRED CUSTOM
THUS DO MEN BLUNDER
EH GYP WANTS ME T LOOK AT HIM
IT'S TRUE THERE'S GOOD VICTUAL ENOUGH ABOUT YOU AS NOBODY SHALL EVER SAY I DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH AND TO SPARE BUT IF THERE'S EVER A BIT O ODDS AN ENDS AS NOBODY ELSE UD EAT YOU'RE SURE TO PICK IT OUT...BUT LOOK THERE
AND THEN I WENT ROUND BY THE RICK-YARD AND TOWART THE TREDDLES'ON ROAD AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH-TREE I SEE THE MAN I TOP-BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD-FACED HOSS--I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T
I THANK YOU KINDLY FOR COMIN FOR IT'S LITTLE WAGE YE GET BY WALKIN THROUGH THE WET FIELDS TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN LIKE ME....NAY I'N GOT NO DAUGHTER O MY OWN--NE'ER HAD ONE--AN I WARNA SORRY FOR THEY'RE POOR QUEECHY THINGS GELLS IS
HE WAS BUT THREE-AND-TWENTY AND HAD ONLY JUST LEARNED WHAT IT IS TO LOVE--TO LOVE WITH THAT ADORATION WHICH A YOUNG MAN GIVES TO A WOMAN WHOM HE FEELS TO BE GREATER AND BETTER THAN HIMSELF
I'LL LAY MY LIFE THEY'RE COME TO SPEAK ABOUT YOUR PREACHING ON THE GREEN DINAH
WHEN A POOR WOMAN LADEN WITH SINS WENT OUT TO THE WELL TO DRAW WATER SHE FOUND THEE SITTING AT THE WELL
AND SINCE THE CAPTAIN WISHES ME TO BE THERE IT UD LOOK AS IF I THOUGHT I KNEW BETTER THAN HIM TO SAY AS I'D RATHER NOT STAY
THE PRISONER AT THE BAR IS THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN WHO CAME LOOKING ILL AND TIRED WITH A BASKET ON HER ARM AND ASKED FOR A LODGING AT MY HOUSE ON SATURDAY EVENING THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY
WHY TH LAD'S FORGOT HIS TOOLS THOUGHT ADAM AND HE'S GOT TO WORK UP AT THE SHOP TO-MORROW
FOR JOSHUA RANN OFFICIATED AS HEAD SEXTON AS WELL AS CLERK AND WAS NOT YET READY TO FOLLOW THE RECTOR INTO THE VESTRY
WE MUST LIVE AND LET LIVE JOSHUA IN RELIGION AS WELL AS IN OTHER THINGS
SUCH MEN HAPPILY HAVE LIVED IN TIMES WHEN GREAT ABUSES FLOURISHED AND HAVE SOMETIMES EVEN BEEN THE LIVING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABUSES
ELSE WHY DOES THE BLIGHT COME AND THE BAD HARVESTS AND THE FEVER AND ALL SORTS OF PAIN AND TROUBLE
IF I DIE MY COUSIN TRADGETT WILL HAVE THE ESTATE AND TAKE MY NAME
SHE HAD TO HOLD IT CLOSE TO THE WINDOW ELSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE READ IT BY THE FAINT LIGHT
WHAT'S THE MATTER WI THEE SAID LISBETH IN ASTONISHMENT
BUT HE FELT AS HE COULDN'T STAND UP TO PREACH AND HE WAS FORCED TO LIE DOWN IN THE FIRST OF THE COTTAGES WE CAME TO
WHAT'S AWANTING TO'T A LOUD ROAR OF LAUGHTER FROM THE OTHER THREE WORKMEN MADE SETH LOOK ROUND CONFUSEDLY
DINAH STOOD STILL FOR A MINUTE HESITATING TO SPEAK BECAUSE HETTY MIGHT BE ASLEEP AND LOOKING AT THE MOTIONLESS HEAP WITH A YEARNING HEART
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXASPERATING FACT TO HIM IF HE HAD KNOWN IT THAT THE GENERAL ATTENTION WAS TOO THOROUGHLY ABSORBED BY BEN'S DANCING FOR ANY ONE TO GIVE MUCH HEED TO THE MUSIC
DEAR BROTHER SETH--YOUR LETTER LAY THREE DAYS BEYOND MY KNOWING OF IT AT THE POST FOR I HAD NOT MONEY ENOUGH BY ME TO PAY THE CARRIAGE THIS BEING A TIME OF GREAT NEED AND SICKNESS HERE WITH THE RAINS THAT HAVE FALLEN AS IF THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN WERE OPENED AGAIN
IT'S BEING THE YOUNGEST AND TH ONLY GELL OH SHE'S A FUNNY LITTLE FATTY
BUT I WENT ON TO THE WOOD AND I WALKED ABOUT BUT THERE WAS NO WATER HETTY SHUDDERED
ADAM PICTURED TO HIMSELF MRS POYSER EXAMINING IT WITH HER KEEN EYE AND TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND OUT A DEFICIENCY
WILL GOD TAKE CARE OF US WHEN WE DIE
THE THICKNESS OF THE WALL FORMED A BROAD STEP ABOUT A YARD BELOW THE WINDOW WHERE SHE COULD PLACE HER CHAIR
EVERYTHING WOULD BE A WEARINESS AND SHE WOULD CARRY ABOUT FOR EVER A HOPELESS THIRST AND LONGING
SHE SAW THE JOURNEY STRETCH BIT BY BIT BEFORE HER NOW
HE'S BEEN RIDIN FIT TO SPLIT THE MARE I TWO THIS FORENOON THAT'S HAPPEN ONE O THE SYMPTIMS JOHN SAID THE FACETIOUS COACHMAN
SHE SAW TOO CLEARLY THE ABSENCE OF ANY WARM SELF-DEVOTING LOVE IN HETTY'S NATURE TO REGARD THE COLDNESS OF HER BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS ADAM AS ANY INDICATION THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FOR A HUSBAND
THE IDLE TRAMPS ALWAYS FELT SURE THEY COULD GET A COPPER FROM SETH
EITHER ARTHUR HAD WRITTEN TO HER AGAIN AND ENTICED HER AWAY OR SHE HAD SIMPLY FLED FROM HER APPROACHING MARRIAGE WITH HIMSELF BECAUSE SHE FOUND AFTER ALL SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM WELL ENOUGH AND YET WAS AFRAID OF HER FRIENDS ANGER IF SHE RETRACTED
SHE SAW HIM AS HE WAS--A POOR MAN WITH OLD PARENTS TO KEEP WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE FOR A LONG WHILE TO COME TO GIVE HER EVEN SUCH LUXURIES AS SHE SHARED IN HER UNCLE'S HOUSE
HETTY COULD HAVE CAST ALL HER PAST LIFE BEHIND HER AND NEVER CARED TO BE REMINDED OF IT AGAIN
SACRIFICES WON'T UNDO IT WHEN IT'S DONE
THERE'S NO MORE MOVING YOU THAN THE ROOTED TREE
HER MIND WAS DARK
MOREOVER BARTLE MASSEY WAS NOT AT CHURCH AND JOSHUA'S IMPORTANCE IN THE CHOIR SUFFERED NO ECLIPSE
MRS POYSER DELIGHTED IN THIS NOISY EXIT
BUT THE HOOFS WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE GATE NOT AWAY FROM IT AND THOUGH THERE WAS A HORSE AGAINST THE STABLE DOOR IT WAS NOT MR IRWINE'S
BUT SHE WOULDN'T COME IN WITHOUT YOUR LEAVE SHE SAID
NO SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD IN THE HOUSE BUT THE LOUD TICKING OF THE OLD DAY-CLOCK AND THE RINGING OF ADAM'S TOOLS
ARTHUR LAY STILL FOR SOME MINUTES AFTER ADAM WAS GONE BUT PRESENTLY HE ROSE FEEBLY FROM THE OTTOMAN AND PEERED ABOUT SLOWLY IN THE BROKEN MOONLIGHT SEEKING SOMETHING
PERHAPS SOME DAY SHE SHOULD BE A GRAND LADY AND RIDE IN HER COACH AND DRESS FOR DINNER IN A BROCADED SILK WITH FEATHERS IN HER HAIR AND HER DRESS SWEEPING THE GROUND LIKE MISS LYDIA AND LADY DACEY WHEN SHE SAW THEM GOING INTO THE DINING-ROOM ONE EVENING AS SHE PEEPED THROUGH THE LITTLE ROUND WINDOW IN THE LOBBY
ADAM HAD NOT MENTIONED TO SETH WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT BUT HE STILL RETAINED SUFFICIENT IMPRESSION FROM IT HIMSELF TO SAY SETH LAD IF FATHER ISN'T COME HOME BY THE TIME WE'VE HAD OUR BREAKFAST I THINK IT'LL BE AS WELL FOR THEE TO GO OVER TO TREDDLES'ON AND LOOK AFTER HIM AND THEE CANST GET ME THE BRASS WIRE I WANT
THE DAYLIGHT AND THE WIND AND THE CORN AND THE COWS TO GIVE US MILK--EVERYTHING WE HAVE COMES FROM GOD
HE THOUGHT HETTY MUST KNOW THAT HE WAS PRESSING HER ARM A LITTLE--A VERY LITTLE
AND THIS HOUSE--THE DRAUGHTS IN IT ARE ENOUGH TO CUT YOU THROUGH AND IT'S MY OPINION THE FLOORS UPSTAIRS ARE VERY ROTTEN AND THE RATS I THE CELLAR ARE BEYOND ANYTHING WHY THAT'S A TERRIBLE PICTURE MRS POYSER
IT WAS PARTLY ON THAT SUBJECT I WISHED TO SPEAK TO YOU
BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE REST LL BE THINE TO TAKE CARE O MOTHER WITH SETH WAS PALE AND TREMBLING
BUT SHE THOUGHT LITTLE OF LEAVING THE MERE SCENE FOR TO HER BLEAK SNOWFIELD HAD JUST AS MANY CHARMS
THE MAN SEATED NEXT TO BILL WAS OF A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE
HE WOULD NOT MARRY HER AND MAKE HER A LADY
IT CAN NEVER MEAN AS YOU'RE T HAVE YOUR OLD FEELINGS BACK AGAIN FOR THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
MR IRWINE WENT TO THE BEDSIDE AND TOOK UP ONE OF THE DELICATE HANDS AND KISSED IT A SLIGHT PRESSURE FROM THE SMALL FINGERS TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS WORTH-WHILE TO HAVE COME UPSTAIRS FOR THE SAKE OF DOING THAT
IT UD DO NOTHING BUT MISCHIEF FOR IT UD MAKE ADAM UNEASY IF HE DOESNA FEEL THE SAME TO HER
I WAS TOO HARD WITH MY FATHER FOR DOING WRONG
AND I SHALL NOT FORGET YOUR READINESS TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LANDLORD AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOUR
MAYBE THERE'S A WORLD ABOUT US AS WE CAN'T SEE BUT TH EAR'S QUICKER THAN THE EYE AND CATCHES A SOUND FROM'T NOW AND THEN
NOW AUNT I'LL LEAVE YOU FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR JUST TO GO TO MY OWN ROOM AND THEN I SHALL COME AND GIVE FULL ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING MY ROOM IS ALL READY FOR ME I SUPPOSE MILLS HE SAID TO THE BUTLER WHO SEEMED TO BE LINGERING UNEASILY ABOUT THE ENTRANCE-HALL
I THOUGHT SHE LOOKED A BIT CRAZY BUT IT WAS NO BUSINESS OF MINE
HE WAR LOST I B'LIEVE AN'S BEEN ALL OF A TREMBLE IVER SIN COME GI US YOUR BASKET AN COME BEHIND AND LET ME PUT Y IN TO LIE ON THE WOOL-PACKS WITH A CRANNY LEFT BETWEEN THE CURTAINS OF THE AWNING TO LET IN THE AIR WAS LUXURY TO HETTY NOW AND SHE HALF-SLEPT AWAY THE HOURS TILL THE DRIVER CAME TO ASK HER IF SHE WANTED TO GET DOWN AND HAVE SOME VICTUAL
YOU MAY COME INTO THE DAIRY IF YOU WILL FOR I CANNA JUSTLY LEAVE THE CHEESE ADAM WALKED INTO THE DAIRY WHERE MRS POYSER AND NANCY WERE CRUSHING THE FIRST EVENING CHEESE
AND THERE WAS NO END TO THE MAKING AND MENDING OF CLOTHES
WITH TIME OUR DUTY WILL BE MADE CLEAR
NOT FIND HER
SO I WENT TO TELL THE PEOPLE THINKING WE'D GO INTO ONE OF THE HOUSES AND I WOULD READ AND PRAY WITH THEM
THE WHOLE TIME THIS WITNESS WAS BEING EXAMINED HETTY HAD STOOD AS MOTIONLESS AS BEFORE
IT'S A MYSTERY WE CAN GIVE NO ACCOUNT OF
THE LAST WORDS HAD CALLED UP A VIVID IMAGE OF THE PAST AND MR IRWINE LEFT HIM TO HIS THOUGHTS WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MR DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND
FOR THE BRICKMAKER HAD BEEN A NOTORIOUS POACHER AND WAS SUSPECTED THOUGH THERE WAS NO GOOD EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM OF BEING THE MAN WHO HAD SHOT A NEIGHBOURING GAMEKEEPER IN THE LEG
SHE DARED NOT STAY TO TAKE OUT HER EAR-RINGS BUT SHE THREW OFF HER SCARF AND LET IT FALL ON THE FLOOR BEFORE THE LIGHT TAP CAME AGAIN
OH THAT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HIS SEEING THAT SHE HAD SUCH A SMART THING--SHE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS WRONG FOR HER TO SPEND HER MONEY ON IT AND SHE KNEW THAT ADAM DISAPPROVED OF FINERY
THE BOYS WERE OUT OF HAND NOW BUT TOTTY WAS STILL A DAY-LONG PLAGUE WORSE THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS HAD BEEN BECAUSE THERE WAS MORE FUSS MADE ABOUT HER
DESIRE IS CHASTENED INTO SUBMISSION AND WE ARE CONTENTED WITH OUR DAY WHEN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAR OUR GRIEF IN SILENCE AND ACT AS IF WE WERE NOT SUFFERING
IF YE WANT VEGETABLES WHILE YE'RE IN TROUBLE YE KNOW WHERE TO COME TO
AND WHEN HE SET HER DOWN SHE TROTTED OFF QUITE SILENTLY TOWARDS THE HOUSE SUCKING HER CHERRIES AS SHE WENT ALONG
DEPEND UPON IT HE MEANT A GOOD CREATURE WHO HAD NO JOY BUT IN THE HAPPINESS OF THE LOVED ONES WHOM SHE CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE UNCOMFORTABLE PUTTING BY ALL THE TID-BITS FOR THEM AND SPENDING NOTHING ON HERSELF
A JET OF LIGHT FROM HIS LANTERN FELL ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE CELL WHERE HETTY WAS SITTING ON HER STRAW PALLET WITH HER FACE BURIED IN HER KNEES
THEY HAD ALL HAD THEIR WORD OF PITY FOR POOR THIAS BUT NOW THEY HAD GOT UPON THE NEARER SUBJECT OF THEIR OWN GRIEVANCES AGAINST SATCHELL THE SQUIRE'S BAILIFF WHO PLAYED THE PART OF STEWARD SO FAR AS IT WAS NOT PERFORMED BY OLD MR DONNITHORNE HIMSELF FOR THAT GENTLEMAN HAD THE MEANNESS TO RECEIVE HIS OWN RENTS AND MAKE BARGAINS ABOUT HIS OWN TIMBER
I DON'T MEAN TO DANCE--I SHALL ONLY LOOK ON
WHAT A MISERABLE FOOL HE WAS TO HAVE BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO SUCH A DILEMMA
HE WAS NEITHER LABORIOUS NOR OBVIOUSLY SELF-DENYING NOR VERY COPIOUS IN ALMS-GIVING AND HIS THEOLOGY YOU PERCEIVE WAS LAX
I'VE NO MORE TO SAY AS CONCERNS THE PRESENT TIME AN SO WE'LL DRINK OUR YOUNG SQUIRE'S HEALTH--THREE TIMES THREE HEREUPON A GLORIOUS SHOUTING A RAPPING A JINGLING A CLATTERING AND A SHOUTING WITH PLENTIFUL DA CAPO PLEASANTER THAN A STRAIN OF SUBLIMEST MUSIC IN THE EARS THAT RECEIVE SUCH A TRIBUTE FOR THE FIRST TIME
HER WORDS AND LOOK WERE ENOUGH TO DETERMINE ADAM
BESIDES ALL THIS HE HAD READ HIS BIBLE INCLUDING THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS
AND AFTER TEA WHEN THE BOYS WERE GOING INTO THE GARDEN AND TOTTY BEGGED TO GO WITH THEM HETTY SAID WITH AN ALACRITY THAT SURPRISED MRS POYSER I'LL GO WITH HER AUNT IT DID NOT SEEM AT ALL SURPRISING THAT ADAM SAID HE WOULD GO TOO AND SOON HE AND HETTY WERE LEFT ALONE TOGETHER ON THE WALK BY THE FILBERT-TREES WHILE THE BOYS WERE BUSY ELSEWHERE GATHERING THE LARGE UNRIPE NUTS TO PLAY AT COB-NUT WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION
AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT DAY WHEN HETTY WAS ON THE COACH THAT WAS TO TAKE HER THEY SAID TO LEICESTER--PART OF THE LONG LONG WAY TO WINDSOR--SHE FELT DIMLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE TRAVELLING ALL THIS WEARY JOURNEY TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF NEW MISERY
LISBETH IN THE PAUSES OF ATTENDING TO HER DINNER ALWAYS SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM AND WATCHED HIM TILL SHE COULD REST NO LONGER WITHOUT GOING UP TO HIM AND GIVING HIM A CARESS TO CALL HIS ATTENTION TO HER
GOOD-BYE SAID THE RECTOR MOUNTING HIS HORSE
I'M HIS BROTHER ADAM
HE HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE LOCKET TO HER AGAIN
AND IF HE HAD HAD THE BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITH HIS PALE WASTED FACE FOR THE SPECTRE OF THE ADAM BEDE WHO ENTERED THE GROVE ON THAT AUGUST EVENING EIGHT MONTHS AGO
THERE LAY THE EAR-RINGS AND THE LOCKET--THE SIGNS OF ALL HER SHORT HAPPINESS--THE SIGNS OF THE LIFELONG DREARINESS THAT WAS TO FOLLOW IT
IT IS MORE NEEDFUL THAT I SHOULD HAVE A FIBRE OF SYMPATHY CONNECTING ME WITH THAT VULGAR CITIZEN WHO WEIGHS OUT MY SUGAR IN A VILELY ASSORTED CRAVAT AND WAISTCOAT THAN WITH THE HANDSOMEST RASCAL IN RED SCARF AND GREEN FEATHERS--MORE NEEDFUL THAT MY HEART SHOULD SWELL WITH LOVING ADMIRATION AT SOME TRAIT OF GENTLE GOODNESS IN THE FAULTY PEOPLE WHO SIT AT THE SAME HEARTH WITH ME OR IN THE CLERGYMAN OF MY OWN PARISH WHO IS PERHAPS RATHER TOO CORPULENT AND IN OTHER RESPECTS IS NOT AN OBERLIN OR A TILLOTSON THAN AT THE DEEDS OF HEROES WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW EXCEPT BY HEARSAY OR AT THE SUBLIMEST ABSTRACT OF ALL CLERICAL GRACES THAT WAS EVER CONCEIVED BY AN ABLE NOVELIST
YET SHE CRIED LESS TO-DAY THAN SHE HAD DONE ANY DAY SINCE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH
IT'S A PITY SHE'S A METHODIST
YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH BIT O ROAD TO GET OVER SINCE I SAW YOU--A ROUGH BIT O ROAD
AND IN THAT CASE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO GREAT HARM DONE SINCE IT WAS STILL ADAM'S ARDENT WISH TO MAKE HER HIS WIFE
IF YOU'LL DO THAT WE'LL FORGIVE YOU FOR MISSING CHURCH
IT'S HIS DOING HE SAID
HE IS IN STONITON TO-NIGHT
DINAH TOOK THE CHAIR SHE HAD JUST LEFT
A SILK HANDKERCHIEF OF A YELLOW TONE ROUND HIS NECK
AND I BELIEVE NOW HE WOULD BEAR THE EXALTATION AS WELL AS ANY POOR WISE MAN IN AN EASTERN STORY
BUT WHEN I TELL YOU I'M GOING AWAY FOR YEARS--WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ME HOW IT CUTS OFF EVERY PLAN OF HAPPINESS I'VE EVER FORMED--IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SENSIBLE MAN LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REAL GROUND FOR THE POYSERS REFUSING TO REMAIN
THE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE BARTLE MASSEY MUST POSSESS WAS SOMETHING SO DIM AND VAST THAT BILL'S IMAGINATION RECOILED BEFORE IT
THAT'S WHY THE ALMANECKS GET SO MUCH CREDIT
YES BUT COME IN SAID MRS POYSER MAKING WAY FOR HIM
HE IS WAITING FOR YOU TO TELL THE TRUTH STILL THERE WAS SILENCE
OF QUIET PERCEPTIONS UNDISEASED BY HYPOTHESIS
WELL BESSY HERE IS YOUR PRIZE--EXCELLENT WARM THINGS FOR WINTER
BUT THAT'S MANY YEARS AGO NOW
THE LITTLE PUSS HADN'T CARED FOR HIM HALF AS MUCH AS HE CARED FOR HER
I'M I TH RIGHT ON'T TO BE UNAISY
THE ONLY AIM THAT SEEMED ADMISSIBLE TO HIM NOW WAS TO DECEIVE ADAM TO THE UTMOST
BUT I SHALL KEEP YOU UNDER YOUR OLD TUTOR'S THUMB TILL THEN MR IRWINE'S FINE AND JOYFUL AT HAVING HIM HOME AGAIN ADAM WAS SILENT A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID IT WAS VERY CUTTING WHEN WE FIRST SAW ONE ANOTHER
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HOW IT WAS WITH JUNO'S LAST PUPS
BUT TOTTY WAS NOT DISPOSED TO SLEEP
THE BUCOLIC CHARACTER AT HAYSLOPE YOU PERCEIVE WAS NOT OF THAT ENTIRELY GENIAL MERRY BROAD-GRINNING SORT APPARENTLY OBSERVED IN MOST DISTRICTS VISITED BY ARTISTS
ADAM BROKE IN IMPATIENTLY
THE NAME WAS--DINAH MORRIS SNOWFIELD
HE COULDN'T IMAGINE HIMSELF IN THAT POSITION
AND HE LIES DEAD THERE
SHE NO LONGER FELT AS IF THE DARKNESS HEDGED HER IN
SHE WENT ON AN THEE'T FIND OUT AS THEE'T POORLY AFF WHEN SHE'S GONE
THEE'T ALLAYS STAY TILL THE LAST CHILD'S BORN
NOT THAT THE MATTER OF THE DISCOURSE HAD ARRESTED HER AT ONCE FOR SHE WAS LOST IN A PUZZLING SPECULATION AS TO WHAT PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION THERE COULD BE IN LIFE TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WORE A CAP LIKE DINAH'S
SOMETIMES HIS LIPS MOVED IN SEMI-ARTICULATION--IT WAS WHEN HE CAME TO A SPEECH THAT HE COULD FANCY HIMSELF UTTERING SUCH AS SAMUEL'S DYING SPEECH TO THE PEOPLE
SO LET US HAVE NO MORE WORDS ABOUT IT EH SAID LISBETH NOT WILLING TO SHOW THAT SHE FELT THE REAL BEARING OF ADAM'S WORDS AND WHO LIKES TO SEE THEE I THY BEST CLOOSE BETTER NOR THY MOTHER
IT'S GETTING LATE NOW AND THERE MAY BE AN ALARM SET UP ABOUT ME AT HOME ADAM GAVE HIS ARM AND THEY WALKED ON WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD TILL THEY CAME WHERE THE BASKET AND THE TOOLS LAY
SEE THE PRINT OF THE NAILS ON HIS DEAR HANDS AND FEET
I'LL NEVER FIGHT ANY MAN AGAIN ONLY WHEN HE BEHAVES LIKE A SCOUNDREL
HUSH MOTHER ADAM SAID RATHER HOARSELY DON'T BE FRIGHTENED
IT WAS A SMALL FACE THAT OF THE POOR SUFFERER
THEN GRADUALLY HER FEARS HER YEARNING ANXIETIES FOR OTHERS MELTED AWAY LIKE ICE-CRYSTALS IN A WARM OCEAN
SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO
BUT DINAH WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE SETH FOR HE HAD TOLD HER HOW ADAM HAD STAYED UP WORKING THE NIGHT BEFORE
SO SHE LIFTED UP HER EYELIDS AND GLANCED TIMIDLY AT THE CUSHIONED PEW IN THE CHANCEL--THERE WAS NO ONE BUT OLD MR DONNITHORNE RUBBING HIS SPECTACLES WITH HIS WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AND MISS LYDIA OPENING THE LARGE GILT-EDGED PRAYER-BOOK
THEY'LL LOOK FOR YOU THERE AS SOON AS YOU'VE GOT TIME TO GO FOR THERE'S NOBODY ROUND THAT HEARTH BUT WHAT'S GLAD TO SEE YOU DINAH WITH HER SYMPATHETIC DIVINATION KNEW QUITE WELL THAT ADAM WAS LONGING TO HEAR IF HETTY HAD SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR TROUBLE
SHE'S FOND ON US I'LL BE BOUND
COME TO THE MUSIC O FRIDAY NIGHT IF YOU CAN MY BOY SAID THE OLD MAN AS HE CLOSED THE GATE AFTER ADAM AND LEANED AGAINST IT
I HAVE TOLD YOU WHERE YOU ARE TO DIRECT A LETTER TO IF YOU WANT TO WRITE BUT I PUT IT DOWN BELOW LEST YOU SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN
AND HE MET HER WITH HER SMART CLOTHES QUITE WET THROUGH AS HE WALKED IN THE RAIN TO TREDDLESTON TO TELL THE CORONER
LOOK AT THIS BROAD-SHOULDERED MAN WITH THE BARE MUSCULAR ARMS AND THE THICK FIRM BLACK HAIR TOSSED ABOUT LIKE TRODDEN MEADOW-GRASS WHENEVER HE TAKES OFF HIS PAPER CAP AND WITH THE STRONG BARYTONE VOICE BURSTING EVERY NOW AND THEN INTO LOUD AND SOLEMN PSALM-TUNES AS IF SEEKING AN OUTLET FOR SUPERFLUOUS STRENGTH YET PRESENTLY CHECKING HIMSELF APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING
AND THINK HOW IT IS WITH ME ADAM
I MIGHT AS WELL TALK TO THE RUNNING BROOK AND TELL IT TO STAN STILL THE CAUSEWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR WAS DRY ENOUGH NOW FOR MRS POYSER TO STAND THERE QUITE PLEASANTLY AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE YARD THE GREY WORSTED STOCKING MAKING A STEADY PROGRESS IN HER HANDS ALL THE WHILE
AMEN DINAH OPENED HER EYES AGAIN AND PAUSED LOOKING AT THE GROUP OF VILLAGERS WHO WERE NOW GATHERED RATHER MORE CLOSELY ON HER RIGHT HAND
THE COMPANY AT ALICK'S END OF THE TABLE TOOK THIS FORM OF VOCAL ENTERTAINMENT VERY MUCH AS A MATTER OF COURSE BEING FREE FROM MUSICAL PREJUDICES
WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE ABOUT GIVING UP ANY O YOUR CORN-LAND AFORE YOUR LEASE IS UP WHICH IT WON'T BE FOR A YEAR COME NEXT MICHAELMAS BUT I'LL NOT CONSENT TO TAKE MORE DAIRY WORK INTO MY HANDS EITHER FOR LOVE OR MONEY
SHE WOULD ASK HER UNCLE THIS VERY DAY
AND THEN I'LL WALK WITH DINAH
BUT THEE MIGHTST ASK HER HE SAID PRESENTLY
THERE'S THAT SHORTHORNED SALLY SHE SAID AS THEY ENTERED THE HOME CLOSE AND SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE MEEK BEAST THAT LAY CHEWING THE CUD AND LOOKING AT HER WITH A SLEEPY EYE
IF THE POYSERS LEARNED THAT HE WAS GONE AWAY AGAIN ADAM KNEW THEY WOULD INFER THAT HE WAS GONE IN SEARCH OF HETTY
BUT IT'S ON MY MIND AS HE'S BEEN FALSE TO ME AND TICED HER AWAY AND SHE'S GONE TO HIM--AND I'M GOING NOW TO SEE FOR I CAN NEVER GO TO WORK AGAIN TILL I KNOW WHAT'S BECOME OF HER DURING ADAM'S NARRATIVE MR IRWINE HAD HAD TIME TO RECOVER HIS SELF-MASTERY IN SPITE OF THE PAINFUL THOUGHTS THAT CROWDED UPON HIM
HIS BLUE HANDKERCHIEF WAS SPREAD OVER HIS KNEES AS WAS USUAL INDOORS WHEN IT WAS NOT HANGING OVER HIS HEAD
IT WAS A SMALL LOW ROOM BELONGING TO THE OLD PART OF THE HOUSE--DARK WITH THE SOMBRE COVERS OF THE BOOKS THAT LINED THE WALLS
WHERE THE TREES ARE FEW SO THAT A CHILD MIGHT COUNT THEM AND THERE'S VERY HARD LIVING FOR THE POOR IN THE WINTER
AT LAST SHE WAS PROMPTED TO SPEAK AND FIND OUT HOW FAR HETTY WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENT
SHE ONLY WANTS TO BE OUT OF THE HIGH-ROAD THAT SHE MAY WALK SLOWLY AND NOT CARE HOW HER FACE LOOKS AS SHE DWELLS ON WRETCHED THOUGHTS
WE ARE JUST THE SORT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HEAR GOOD NEWS
AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT
BUT LISBETH FOLLOWED HIM
BUT IT'S AN IMPIOUS UNSCRIPTURAL OPINION TO SAY A WOMAN'S A BLESSING TO A MAN NOW
IT WAS SETH BEDE AS WAS ALLAYS A WOOL-GATHERING CHAP AND RELIGION HASNA CURED HIM THE MORE'S THE PITY NE'ER HEED ME SETH SAID WIRY BEN Y ARE A DOWN-RIGHT GOOD-HEARTED CHAP PANELS OR NO PANELS
PLEASANT THE CRACK OF THE POST-BOY'S WHIP
I COULDNA THINK HOW HE HAPPENED AWAY FROM CHURCH
NO MY DEAR NO SAID DINAH KINDLY FOR MRS POYSER HAD PASSED ON TO THE PANTRY WITHOUT DEIGNING MORE PRECISE INFORMATION
AND YOU KEEP IT SO EXQUISITELY CLEAN MRS POYSER
AND AS SHE GOT DOWN AT THE SIGN OF THE GREEN MAN IN WINDSOR AT TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTH DAY HUNGRY AND FAINT THE COACHMAN CAME UP AND BEGGED HER TO REMEMBER HIM SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET AND TOOK OUT THE SHILLING BUT THE TEARS CAME WITH THE SENSE OF EXHAUSTION AND THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GIVING AWAY HER LAST MEANS OF GETTING FOOD WHICH SHE REALLY REQUIRED BEFORE SHE COULD GO IN SEARCH OF ARTHUR
IT MIGHT BE A GREAT HAPPINESS TO US ALL IF SHE'D HAVE THEE FOR MOTHER TOOK TO HER SO WONDERFUL AND SEEMED SO CONTENTED TO BE WITH HER AYE SAID SETH RATHER TIMIDLY AND DINAH'S FOND O HETTY TOO
OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN
OH I TRIED SO TO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POOL AND I COULDN'T
AND YET EVEN THAT MIGHT DISTURB HER A BIT PERHAPS
YESTERDAY HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HER WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY I CAME TO SEE YOU DINAH
SIT YE DOWN I TH ARM-CHAIR
I WANT HIM TO FEEL WHAT SHE FEELS
THEE WOULDSTNA GO TO WORK AGAIN WI'OUT HA'IN THY BIT O SUPPER ADAM TOO ANGRY TO SPEAK WALKED INTO THE WORKSHOP
FOR SHE'S SO THOUGHTLESS SHE'D BE LIKE ENOUGH TO GO AN ENGAGE HERSELF FOR IVERY DANCE
YOU COULDN'T FORGET HER IF YOU SAW HER NAY
MR POYSER WAS WALKING BRISKLY THIS MARCH MORNING WITH A SENSE OF SPRING BUSINESS ON HIS MIND
TOM EXCEPTED MARTIN POYSER HAD SOME PRIDE IN HIS SERVANTS AND LABOURERS THINKING WITH SATISFACTION THAT THEY WERE THE BEST WORTH THEIR PAY OF ANY SET ON THE ESTATE
BESSY HAD BEEN TEMPTED TO RUN THE ARDUOUS RACE PARTLY FROM MERE HEDONISH GAIETY PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE PRIZE
STILL SHE HESITATED
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW HE'S ALWAYS HAD JUST THE SAME SORT O LOOK WHEN HE SMILES I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SMILE POOR YOUNG MAN SAID DINAH
THEY WERE HETTY'S EYES LOOKING AT HIM WITH THAT MOURNFUL GAZE AS IF SHE HAD COME BACK TO HIM FROM THE DEAD TO TELL HIM OF HER MISERY
BUT SETH FELT IN AN INSTANT WHAT THE MARKS MEANT--NOT DRUNKENNESS BUT SOME GREAT CALAMITY
THEM YOUNG GELLS ARE LIKE THE UNRIPE GRAIN
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF MISS LYDIA DONNITHORNE AT BATH MRS BEST MR MILLS AND MR CRAIG HAD FELT IT INCUMBENT ON THEM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AT THE CHASE ON THE OCCASION
AND FEELING'S A SORT O KNOWLEDGE DINAH WAS SILENT
HE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A GOLD-SEEKER WHO SEES THE STRONG PROMISE OF GOLD BUT SEES IN THE SAME MOMENT A SICKENING VISION OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AND HE WAS VERY KIND TO THE LITTLE CHILDREN AND COMFORTED THOSE WHO HAD LOST THEIR FRIENDS
EH WHAT ELSE SHOULD IT MANE
I HARDLY EVER SEE YOU ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT HOME AND AT CHURCH AUNT DOESN'T LIKE ME TO GO A-WALKING ONLY WHEN I'M GOING SOMEWHERE SAID HETTY
MR CASSON WE HAVE SEEN CONSIDERED ADAM RATHER LIFTED UP AND PEPPERY-LIKE
WE SET OUR HEARTS ON THINGS WHICH IT ISN'T GOD'S WILL FOR US TO HAVE AND THEN WE GO SORROWING
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE PREACHING FOR MORE THAN YOU'RE PREACHING NOW
HE WOULD GO AND TELL IRWINE--TELL HIM EVERYTHING
I LIKE TO KEEP MY BREATH FOR DOING I'STEAD O TALKING I KNOW THEE DOST THINGS AS NOBODY ELSE UD DO MY LAD
FOR IF A COUNTRY BEAUTY IN CLUMSY SHOES BE ONLY SHALLOW-HEARTED ENOUGH IT IS ASTONISHING HOW CLOSELY HER MENTAL PROCESSES MAY RESEMBLE THOSE OF A LADY IN SOCIETY AND CRINOLINE WHO APPLIES HER REFINED INTELLECT TO THE PROBLEM OF COMMITTING INDISCRETIONS WITHOUT COMPROMISING HERSELF
NO HE WAS NOT THERE
KEEP YOURSELF QUIET MY LAD SAID BARTLE
IT'S FINE TALKING ABOUT HAVING SUPPER WHEN HERE'S A COFFIN PROMISED TO BE READY AT BROX'ON BY SEVEN O'CLOCK TO-MORROW MORNING AND OUGHT TO HA BEEN THERE NOW AND NOT A NAIL STRUCK YET
MEANWHILE THE BULL-DOG THE BLACK-AND-TAN TERRIER ALICK'S SHEEP-DOG AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MRS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET
O GOD SAVE ME MAKE ME PURE FROM SIN WHILE YOU CLING TO ONE SIN AND WILL NOT PART WITH IT IT MUST DRAG YOU DOWN TO MISERY AFTER DEATH AS IT HAS DRAGGED YOU TO MISERY HERE IN THIS WORLD MY POOR POOR HETTY
DINAH BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER HETTY WAS CONSCIOUS WHO IT WAS THAT SAT BESIDE HER
IRWINE RETURNED FROM STONITON IN A POST-CHAISE THAT NIGHT AND THE FIRST WORDS CARROLL SAID TO HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE WERE THAT SQUIRE DONNITHORNE WAS DEAD--FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED AT TEN O'CLOCK THAT MORNING--AND THAT MRS IRWINE DESIRED HIM TO SAY SHE SHOULD BE AWAKE WHEN MR IRWINE CAME HOME AND SHE BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO TO BED WITHOUT SEEING HER
I RECKON FOLKS IS DIFFERENT AT SNOWFIELD FROM WHAT THEY ARE HERE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT SORT OF LIFE MANY OF EM SAID DINAH
SHE WOULD OWE THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS CARE FOR HER IN FUTURE YEARS TO THE SORROW SHE HAD INCURRED NOW
BUT ADAM COULD NOT SIT DOWN TO HIS READING AGAIN AND HE SAUNTERED ALONG BY THE BROOK AND STOOD LEANING AGAINST THE STILES WITH EAGER INTENSE EYES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY SAW SOMETHING VERY VIVIDLY
BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT
AND THAT BEAUTIFUL BIT OF NECK WHERE THE ROUNDNESS OF HER CHEEK MELTED INTO ANOTHER ROUNDNESS SHADOWED BY DARK DELICATE CURLS
BUT HETTY WAS WRONG IN PART OF HER CONJECTURE
THEN ARTHUR SAID I'LL SEE YOU TO-MORROW
AND IF THEIR WORDS HAD TAKEN ANOTHER TURN...IF HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN LESS FASTIDIOUS ABOUT INTRUDING ON ANOTHER MAN'S SECRETS...IT WAS CRUEL TO THINK HOW THIN A FILM HAD SHUT OUT RESCUE FROM ALL THIS GUILT AND MISERY
WHAT CAN ONE SAY MORE
AND THERE PERHAPS WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SHE COULD DO SHE SHOULD GET COURAGE TO DROWN HERSELF IN SOME POND LIKE THAT IN THE SCANTLANDS
IT SEEMED HE COULDN'T QUITE DEPEND ON HIS OWN RESOLUTION AS HE HAD THOUGHT HE COULD
I'VE SEEN THAT IN TIMES O TROUBLE
I'LL NOT BELIEVE IT
MRS POYSER IS LOOKING AT YOU
SIMPLY TO CLOSE HER EYES AND TO FEEL HERSELF ENCLOSED BY THE DIVINE PRESENCE
YE'VE BEEN HELPING HETTY TO GETHER THE CURRAN'S EH
THEN WE CAN HAVE A BIT O TALK TOGETHER
FOR NONE OF HER RELATIONS HE WAS SURE WOULD GIVE HER A LOCKET LIKE THAT
HOWIVER I'VE MADE A DRAP MORE PORRIDGE NOR COMMON THIS MORNIN THE FEYTHER ULL HAPPEN COME IN ARTER A BIT
PERHAPS I CAN BE OF USE TO HER SO I HAVE FETCHED MY BONNET AND AM GOING TO SET OUT DEAR HEART DEAR HEART
SHE WONDERED AND WAS AFRAID--AND THE NEXT MOMENT HER THOUGHTS FLEW TO THE PAST
IT'S BEEN DRAWN FOR YOU--IT'S BEEN DRAWN FOR YOU NAY MR MASSEY SAID ADAM WHO TOOK HIS OLD FRIEND'S WHIM MORE SERIOUSLY THAN USUAL TO-NIGHT DON'T BE SO HARD ON THE CREATURS GOD HAS MADE TO BE COMPANIONS FOR US
SHE COULD HAVE NO ACQUAINTANCES THAT DID NOT COME THERE AND NO INTIMACIES UNKNOWN TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT
DON'T LET ME HEAR THEE SAY SUCH THINGS AGAIN
HIS FIRST DUTY WAS TO GUARD HER
I'LL HEAR WHAT IT IS
I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND SCARCELY KNEW ANYTHING AND THIS OLD MAN SEEMED TO ME SUCH A DIFFERENT SORT OF A MAN FROM ANYBODY I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT I THOUGHT HE HAD PERHAPS COME DOWN FROM THE SKY TO PREACH TO US AND I SAID AUNT WILL HE GO BACK TO THE SKY TO-NIGHT LIKE THE PICTURE IN THE BIBLE THAT MAN OF GOD WAS MR WESLEY WHO SPENT HIS LIFE IN DOING WHAT OUR BLESSED LORD DID--PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR--AND HE ENTERED INTO HIS REST EIGHT YEARS AGO
WE ARE MORE DISTINCTLY CONSCIOUS THAT RUDE PENANCES ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR GENTLEMEN IN AN ENLIGHTENED AGE AND THAT MORTAL SIN IS NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH AN APPETITE FOR MUFFINS
WITHOUT THIS FELLOW-FEELING HOW ARE WE TO GET ENOUGH PATIENCE AND CHARITY TOWARDS OUR STUMBLING FALLING COMPANIONS IN THE LONG AND CHANGEFUL JOURNEY
SO THE LILY FACE LOOKED OUT WITH SWEET GRAVITY FROM UNDER A GREY QUAKER BONNET NEITHER SMILING NOR BLUSHING BUT WITH LIPS TREMBLING A LITTLE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SOLEMN FEELINGS
AND THE ARTHUR WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HER AND LOOKED AT HER IN THIS WAY WHO WAS PRESENT WITH HER NOW--WHOSE ARM SHE FELT ROUND HER HIS CHEEK AGAINST HERS HIS VERY BREATH UPON HER--WAS THE CRUEL CRUEL ARTHUR WHO HAD WRITTEN THAT LETTER THAT LETTER WHICH SHE SNATCHED AND CRUSHED AND THEN OPENED AGAIN THAT SHE MIGHT READ IT ONCE MORE
I LONGED SO FOR IT DINAH I LONGED SO TO BE SAFE AT HOME
AN THEE DANC'ST AS WELL AS ANY OF EM FOR I'LL BACK THEE AGAINST ALL THE WIVES I THE PARISH FOR A LIGHT FOOT AN ANKLE
BUT INDEED IT IS NEEDFUL FOR MY OWN SOUL THAT I SHOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS LIFE OF EASE AND LUXURY IN WHICH I HAVE ALL THINGS TOO RICHLY TO ENJOY--AT LEAST THAT I SHOULD GO AWAY FOR A SHORT SPACE
SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
HITHERTO HE HAD FELT KEENLY THE DANGER THAT SOME OTHER MAN MIGHT STEP IN AND GET POSSESSION OF HETTY'S HEART AND HAND WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS STILL IN A POSITION THAT MADE HIM SHRINK FROM ASKING HER TO ACCEPT HIM
SHE BEGAN TO WALK ABOUT THAT SHE MIGHT GET WARM AGAIN AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE MORE RESOLUTION THEN
OTHERS THOUGHT SHE LOOKED AS IF SOME DEMON HAD CAST A BLIGHTING GLANCE UPON HER WITHERED UP THE WOMAN'S SOUL IN HER AND LEFT ONLY A HARD DESPAIRING OBSTINACY
THE MORE'S THE PITY
HE LIVES AT BROX'ON OVER THE HILL THERE
AND IF I WERE AN ARTIST I WOULD PAINT HER
BUT TO-DAY HAVING BEEN OCCUPIED ELSEWHERE HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ARRIVE AT THE CHASE FARM TILL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND HE THEN DISCOVERED THAT SOME OLD ROOFING WHICH HE HAD CALCULATED ON PRESERVING HAD GIVEN WAY
IT WAS A SMALL THICK BIBLE WORN QUITE ROUND AT THE EDGES
IT'S WELL WE SHOULD FEEL AS LIFE'S A RECKONING WE CAN'T MAKE TWICE OVER
LISBETH HAD TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AGAIN TOWARDS THE GRAVE
SHE'LL BE THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH AFTER A WHILE
MR POYSER INSISTED THAT THE BEST PLAN WOULD BE FOR SETH AND HIS MOTHER TO MOVE AND LEAVE ADAM IN THE OLD HOME WHICH MIGHT BE ENLARGED AFTER A WHILE FOR THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPACE IN THE WOODYARD AND GARDEN
SHE ONLY FELT THAT ALL HER HOPE WAS CRUSHED AND THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING FOUND A REFUGE SHE HAD ONLY REACHED THE BORDERS OF A NEW WILDERNESS WHERE NO GOAL LAY BEFORE HER
EVEN THE OLD MOTTLED GLASS COULDN'T HELP SENDING BACK A LOVELY IMAGE NONE THE LESS LOVELY BECAUSE HETTY'S STAYS WERE NOT OF WHITE SATIN--SUCH AS I FEEL SURE HEROINES MUST GENERALLY WEAR--BUT OF A DARK GREENISH COTTON TEXTURE
AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT
HER DARK EYES ARE SOMEWHAT DIM NOW--PERHAPS FROM TOO MUCH CRYING--BUT HER BROADLY MARKED EYEBROWS ARE STILL BLACK HER TEETH ARE SOUND AND AS SHE STANDS KNITTING RAPIDLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY WITH HER WORK-HARDENED HANDS SHE HAS AS FIRMLY UPRIGHT AN ATTITUDE AS WHEN SHE IS CARRYING A PAIL OF WATER ON HER HEAD FROM THE SPRING
LET A-BE LAD LET A-BE
SHE GOT UP TO LOOK ABOUT FOR STONES AND SOON BROUGHT FIVE OR SIX WHICH SHE LAID DOWN BESIDE HER BASKET AND THEN SAT DOWN AGAIN
WHO IS WAITING NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR FOR HER TO TURN TO HIM AND CONFESS HER SIN AND CRY FOR MERCY--NOW BEFORE THE NIGHT OF DEATH COMES AND THE MOMENT OF PARDON IS FOR EVER FLED LIKE YESTERDAY THAT RETURNETH NOT
BUT I DONNA WANT TO SAY THEE NAY LET THEE BRING HOME WHO THEE WUT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY TH LAD TOOK HER TOO CLOSE TO DALTON'S HOSSES AN ONE ON EM FLUNG OUT AT HER AN SHE'S GOT HER SHANK BRUISED O THE NEAR FORELEG THE JUDICIOUS HISTORIAN ABSTAINS FROM NARRATING PRECISELY WHAT ENSUED
YE WAR IN A HURRY TO GET SOME FOR ME AS HAD NO NEED BUT YE DONNA THINK O GETTIN T FOR THEM AS WANTS IT
AND SO HE WAS
AND HERE ADAM ALWAYS SAT WHEN HE HAD WRITING TO DO OR PLANS TO MAKE
HIS LIPS ARE PARCHED WITH THIRST AND THEY MOCK HIM STILL IN THIS GREAT AGONY
THEY'D MORE NEED BE BROUGHT TO SEE AS THE WRONG THEY DO CAN NEVER BE ALTERED
AN WHAT SHOULD SHE DO BUT LOVE THEE
BUT THEY'RE SLOW THEY'RE SLOW
AND IT'S AN UNNAT'RAL THING TO HAVE ONE BIT O YOUR FARM IN ONE COUNTY AND ALL THE REST IN ANOTHER AH THE SCANTLANDS WOULD GO MUCH BETTER WITH CHOYCE'S FARM ESPECIALLY AS HE WANTS DAIRYLAND AND YOU'VE GOT PLENTY
I THANK YOU ALL MY GOOD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS ARTHUR SAID FOR THE GOOD OPINION OF ME AND THE KIND FEELINGS TOWARDS ME WHICH MR POYSER HAS BEEN EXPRESSING ON YOUR BEHALF AND ON HIS OWN AND IT WILL ALWAYS BE MY HEARTIEST WISH TO DESERVE THEM
SHE ONLY THINKS IT UD BE TROUBLING THEE FOR NOUGHT JUST TO COME IN TO SAY GOOD-BYE OVER AGAIN SHE'D NE'ER GO AWAY I KNOW IF ADAM UD BE FOND ON HER AN MARRY HER BUT EVERYTHING'S SO CONTRAIRY SAID LISBETH WITH A BURST OF VEXATION
COME FATHER THE HEAVY WOODEN BOLTS BEGAN TO ROLL IN THE HOUSE DOORS AND OLD MARTIN PREPARED TO MOVE BY GATHERING UP HIS BLUE HANDKERCHIEF AND REACHING HIS BRIGHT KNOBBED WALNUT-TREE STICK FROM THE CORNER
BUT I NEVER RIGHTLY NOTICED HER TILL SHE CAME TO SEE MOTHER LAST WEEK AND THEN I THOUGHT THE CAP SEEMED TO FIT HER FACE SOMEHOW AS TH ACORN-CUP FITS TH ACORN AND I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE HER SO WELL WITHOUT IT
IT WOULD BE HARDNESS OF HEART TO SAY THAT YOUR TROUBLE WAS NOT HEAVY TO BEAR
AND ON GIVING A LAST LOOK ROUND HE OBSERVED THAT SETH WHO HAD BEEN WORKING HERE TO-DAY HAD LEFT HIS BASKET OF TOOLS BEHIND HIM
I'LL PRETEND I'M COME TO LOOK ON AT THE ASSIZES
TH MET'OROLOGICAL ALMANECKS CAN LEARN ME NOTHING BUT THERE'S A PRETTY SIGHT O THINGS I COULD LET THEM UP TO IF THEY'D JUST COME TO ME
SUCH YOUNG UNFURROWED SOULS ROLL TO MEET EACH OTHER LIKE TWO VELVET PEACHES THAT TOUCH SOFTLY AND ARE AT REST
AND IS HE NOT ONE WITH THE INFINITE LOVE ITSELF--AS OUR LOVE IS ONE WITH OUR SORROW
SHE SPOKE SO FIRM AND SHE'S NOT THE WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER NAY BUT HER FEELINGS MAY GROW DIFFERENT
COME BACK TO-MORROW IF MRS BEDE DOESN'T WANT YOU DINAH SAID MRS POYSER
THERE'S NOBODY COMES WITH HER FROM POYSER'S THEE KNOW'ST THEN I'LL TELL MOTHER NOT TO LOOK FOR THEE SAID ADAM
I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU THERE
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO THE NIGHT-SCHOOL TO SEE WHY BARTLE MASSEY HAD NOT BEEN AT CHURCH YESTERDAY FOR HE FEARED HIS OLD FRIEND WAS ILL
IT'S POOR FOOLISHNESS TO RUN DOWN YOUR ENEMIES
HE FELT HIMSELF RIDING OVER THE HILLS IN THE BREEZY AUTUMN DAYS LOOKING AFTER FAVOURITE PLANS OF DRAINAGE AND ENCLOSURE
THE DELICATE DARK RINGS OF HAIR LIE SO CHARMINGLY ABOUT HER EARS AND NECK
VERY WISELY FOR NO OTHER ROOM COULD HAVE BEEN SO AIRY OR WOULD HAVE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THE WIDE DOORS OPENING INTO THE GARDEN AS WELL AS A READY ENTRANCE INTO THE OTHER ROOMS
MRS IRWINE AND I WHO ARE ELDERLY PEOPLE THINK OF SITTING OUT THE DANCE TILL THEN OH YOUR HONOUR IT'S ALL RIGHT AND PROPER FOR GENTLEFOLKS TO STAY UP BY CANDLELIGHT--THEY'VE GOT NO CHEESE ON THEIR MINDS
CHAPTER XLIV ARTHUR'S RETURN WHEN ARTHUR DONNITHORNE LANDED AT LIVERPOOL AND READ THE LETTER FROM HIS AUNT LYDIA BRIEFLY ANNOUNCING HIS GRAND-FATHER'S DEATH HIS FIRST FEELING WAS POOR GRANDFATHER
AH SHE WENT ON YOU'LL DO NO GOOD WI CRYING AN MAKING MORE WET TO WIPE UP
I'VE WRITTEN TO HIM TO DESIRE THAT FROM HENCEFORTH HE WILL SEND ME NO BOOK OR PAMPHLET ON ANYTHING THAT ENDS IN ISM WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M VERY FOND OF ISMS MYSELF
THERE STANDING WITHOUT HIS HAT AND TAKING SUCH CARE OF THAT TALL OLD WOMAN BY THE SIDE OF HIM--HIS MOTHER OF COURSE
NO SOMETHING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN--SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN--TO SET HER FREE FROM THIS DREAD
BUT I WAS ALL WRONG FROM THE VERY FIRST AND HORRIBLE WRONG HAS COME OF IT
I WON'T SIT DOWN SAID DINAH FOR I MUST HASTEN BACK
SETH WAS SO HAPPY NOW DINAH WAS IN THE HOUSE THAT HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING HER PRESENCE WAS WORTH PURCHASING WITH A LIFE IN WHICH GRIEF INCESSANTLY FOLLOWED UPON GRIEF
HE IS A GOOD FELLOW ADAM COULD NOT HELP BEING MOVED
BUT PRAY HOW MANY OF YOUR WELL-WISHERS WOULD DECLINE TO MAKE A LITTLE GAIN OUT OF YOU
WHOSE FARTHEST JOURNEY HAD BEEN TO ROSSETER ON THE PILLION WITH HER UNCLE
FOR ADAM KNEW THE ARTICLES QUITE WELL AS BECAME A GOOD CHURCHMAN
ARE YE A-TURNIN ROUN ADAM
AN TO THINK OF HER LEAVING A PARISH WHERE SHE'S SO LOOKED ON
SETH AND ME ARE SURE TO FIND WORK HE SAID
THERE'S MRS BEDE GETTING AS OLD AND CAS'ALTY AS CAN BE AND SHE WON'T LET ANYBODY BUT YOU GO A-NIGH HER HARDLY
BUT HE IS OF OPINION THAT THEY MIGHT BE PERSUADED OUT OF THIS IDEA THAT THEY ARE DISGRACED IN THE EYES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS AND THAT THEY CAN'T REMAIN ON MY ESTATE IF YOU WOULD JOIN HIM IN HIS EFFORTS--IF YOU WOULD STAY YOURSELF AND GO ON MANAGING THE OLD WOODS ARTHUR PAUSED A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED PLEADINGLY YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD WORK TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE OWNER
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A FLOWER ITSELF
THE WONDERS THAT HAD HAPPENED THEN HAD BROUGHT NO CHANGES AFTER THEM
ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO WALK NOW
CAN ANYTHING BE HOLIER THAN THAT
I CAN READ SMALL PRINT WITHOUT SPECTACLES AH MY DEAR SIR YOU BEGAN WITH BEING VERY NEAR-SIGHTED AND THOSE NEAR-SIGHTED EYES ALWAYS WEAR THE BEST
I MANE TO GROON AS LOUD AS YOUR COW DID TH OTHER NAIGHT AN THEN THE PRAICHER ULL THINK I'M I TH RAIGHT WAY I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO BE UP TO NO NONSENSE CHAD SAID MR CASSON WITH SOME DIGNITY
HETTY LIKED DINAH AS WELL AS SHE HAD EVER LIKED ANY WOMAN
YOU MUSTNA MIND THAT MY WENCH--SHE DOES IT FOR YOUR GOOD
SHE ONLY SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS POSSIBLE
SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD WALK BACK ACROSS THE FIELD AND GET OVER THE STILE
IT WON'T BE HE SAID IT'LL BE PUT OFF--THERE'LL PERHAPS COME A PARDON
IT'S ALL I'VE GOT TO THINK OF NOW--TO DO MY WORK WELL AND MAKE THE WORLD A BIT BETTER PLACE FOR THEM AS CAN ENJOY IT THEN WE'LL PART NOW ADAM
BUT THE COACHMAN COULD NOT BE SEEN FOR ANOTHER MAN HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THAT ROAD IN HIS STEAD THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS
BUT FOR ALL WHO SAW THEM THROUGH A LESS MYTHICAL MEDIUM THE MISS IRWINES WERE QUITE SUPERFLUOUS EXISTENCES--INARTISTIC FIGURES CROWDING THE CANVAS OF LIFE WITHOUT ADEQUATE EFFECT
THE LEADED WINDOWS WERE BRIGHT AND SPECKLESS AND THE DOOR-STONE WAS AS CLEAN AS A WHITE BOULDER AT EBB TIDE
SHE OUGHT NOT TO COME HOME THIS WAY SO LATE
SHE HAD OPENED ON THAT MEMORABLE PARTING AT EPHESUS WHEN PAUL HAD FELT BOUND TO OPEN HIS HEART IN A LAST EXHORTATION AND WARNING
FATHER'S A SORE CROSS TO ME AN'S LIKELY TO BE FOR MANY A LONG YEAR TO COME
HE STOOD AS IF PETRIFIED BY AN UNSEEN FORCE BUT THE FORCE WAS HIS OWN STRONG WILL
I SHOULD LIKE EVERY FARMER'S WIFE TO COME AND LOOK AT IT FOR A PATTERN OH YOU'RE PLEASED TO SAY SO SIR
MOREOVER MR CRAIG WAS A MAN OF SOBER PASSIONS AND WAS ALREADY IN HIS TENTH YEAR OF HESITATION AS TO THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF MATRIMONY AND BACHELORHOOD
BUT I SHALL NEVER WANT TO BE MARRIED IF YOU WON'T HAVE ME HETTY LOOKED UP AT HIM AND SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS AS SHE HAD DONE TO ARTHUR THAT FIRST EVENING IN THE WOOD WHEN SHE HAD THOUGHT HE WAS NOT COMING AND YET HE CAME
YOU REMEMBER CHAD CRANAGE THE BLACKSMITH YES TO BE SURE SAID MRS IRWINE
AND THERE'S THE FETCHING AND CARRYING AS UD BE WELLY HALF A DAY'S WORK FOR A MAN AN HOSS--THAT'S TO BE TOOK OUT O THE PROFITS I RECKON
YOU'D NO GROUNDS FOR KNOWING IT
SHE WAS DRESSED NOW JUST AS SHE WAS TO BE IN THE EVENING WITH A TUCKER MADE OF REAL LACE WHICH HER AUNT HAD LENT HER FOR THIS UNPARALLELED OCCASION BUT WITH NO ORNAMENTS BESIDES
JESUS THOU PRESENT SAVIOUR
AND SOME OF THESE THINGS WAS VERY TERRIBLE SO AS WE MIGHT WELL TREMBLE WHEN WE THOUGHT OF HIM
HE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HIDDEN BEHIND THE APPLE-BLOSSOMS OR AMONG THE GOLDEN CORN OR UNDER THE SHROUDING BOUGHS OF THE WOOD THERE MIGHT BE A HUMAN HEART BEATING HEAVILY WITH ANGUISH--PERHAPS A YOUNG BLOOMING GIRL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO TURN FOR REFUGE FROM SWIFT-ADVANCING SHAME UNDERSTANDING NO MORE OF THIS LIFE OF OURS THAN A FOOLISH LOST LAMB WANDERING FARTHER AND FARTHER IN THE NIGHTFALL ON THE LONELY HEATH YET TASTING THE BITTEREST OF LIFE'S BITTERNESS
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH JONATHAN BURGE WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AT PRESENT--THERE WERE THINGS IMPLICITLY TACKED TO IT THAT HE COULD NOT ACCEPT
I THINK HIS MORNING BATH DOESN'T AGREE WITH HIM ARTHUR WAS ANXIOUS NOT TO IMPLY THAT HE CAME WITH ANY SPECIAL PURPOSE
BUT HE SHOOK THEM OFF WITH THE FORCE OF YOUTH AND HOPE
WRITE A LETTER TO DINAH CANSTNA
SHE HAD FALLEN DOWN IN A FAINTING-FIT AND WAS CARRIED OUT OF COURT
SHE GIVES ONE GREAT SOB WHILE THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH QUIVER AND THE TEARS ROLL DOWN
PEOPLE IN A HIGH STATION ARE OF COURSE MORE THOUGHT OF AND TALKED ABOUT AND HAVE THEIR VIRTUES MORE PRAISED THAN THOSE WHOSE LIVES ARE PASSED IN HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK
THIS BLUSH RECALLED ADAM FROM HIS FORGETFULNESS
IN HIS IMAGINATION HE SAW LONG YEARS OF HIS FUTURE LIFE STRETCHING BEFORE HIM BLEST WITH THE RIGHT TO CALL HETTY HIS OWN
MARTIN POYSER AND THE GRANDFATHER WERE NOT YET COME IN FROM THE MEADOW
AND THEN I GOT TO STONITON AND I BEGAN TO FEEL FRIGHTENED THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I WAS SO NEAR HOME
AGAIN AND AGAIN HIS VISION WAS INTERRUPTED BY WONDER AT THE STRENGTH OF HIS OWN FEELING AT THE STRENGTH AND SWEETNESS OF THIS NEW LOVE--ALMOST LIKE THE WONDER A MAN FEELS AT THE ADDED POWER HE FINDS IN HIMSELF FOR AN ART WHICH HE HAD LAID ASIDE FOR A SPACE
BUT AGAIN ALL WAS STILL AND THE STARLIGHT SHOWED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE DEW-LADEN GRASS IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE
IT WAS BARTLE MASSEY COME BACK
BUT YOU CAN STAY YOU KNOW IF SHE'S ILL SO WHEN THE GOOD-BYES HAD BEEN SAID DINAH AND ADAM LEFT THE HALL FARM TOGETHER
BUT MR MILLS THE BUTLER ASSURED HIM THAT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAD GIVEN PARTICULAR ORDERS ABOUT IT AND WOULD BE VERY ANGRY IF ADAM WAS NOT THERE
THE MIDDAY SUN WAS STREAMING INTO HETTY'S BEDCHAMBER AND THERE WAS NO BLIND TO TEMPER THE HEAT WITH WHICH IT FELL ON HER HEAD AS SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE OLD SPECKED GLASS
AND INDEED HE DID SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFER HIMSELF TO THE SARACEN'S HEAD WHICH WAS DOING A THRIVING BUSINESS IN THE BACK STREET OF A NEIGHBOURING MARKET-TOWN
OR ELSE THAT THE EYELASHES EXPRESS THE DISPOSITION OF THE FAIR ONE'S GRANDMOTHER WHICH IS ON THE WHOLE LESS IMPORTANT TO US
THAT WAS ADAM'S STATE OF MIND IN THIS SECOND AUTUMN OF HIS SORROW
ELSE WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE CARED TO HAVE EAR-RINGS RATHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE
HE COULD NOT SEE HER FACE AT CHURCH FOR SHE HAD CHANGED HER SEAT AND WHEN HE CAME UP TO HER TO SHAKE HANDS HER MANNER WAS DOUBTFUL AND CONSTRAINED
BUT IN THE END IT GENERALLY HAPPENS THAT NO ONE HAS HAD AN ENJOYABLE MEAL
BUT I SEE THAT OUR MARRIAGE IS NOT GOD'S WILL--HE DRAWS MY HEART ANOTHER WAY
FOR DINAH WAS BENT ON THIS BELIEVING THAT THE SENSE OF ORDER AND QUIETUDE AROUND HER WOULD HELP IN DISPOSING LISBETH TO JOIN IN THE PRAYER SHE LONGED TO POUR FORTH AT HER SIDE
AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HIM ARTHUR WENT TO THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET AND TOOK OUT THE LITTLE PINK SILK HANDKERCHIEF
ARTHUR LOST HIMSELF AMONG THE NARROW OPENINGS IN THE FERN WINDING ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY ISSUE TILL THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED ALMOST TO NIGHT UNDER THE GREAT BOUGHS AND THE HARE LOOKED BLACK AS IT DARTED ACROSS HIS PATH
GOOD-TEMPERED TIM THE WAGGONER WHO LOVED HIS HORSES HAD HIS GRUDGE AGAINST ALICK IN THE MATTER OF CORN
THE ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORIAN TOO LOOKING INTO PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS OF THAT PERIOD FINDS HONOURABLE MEMBERS ZEALOUS FOR THE CHURCH AND UNTAINTED WITH ANY SYMPATHY FOR THE TRIBE OF CANTING METHODISTS MAKING STATEMENTS SCARCELY LESS MELANCHOLY THAN THAT OF MR ROE
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER IN NICE CLOTHES AND THIN SHOES AND WHITE STOCKINGS PERHAPS WITH SILK CLOCKS TO THEM
HE IS GONE BACK TO HIS HOME NOW AND THE POOR SINNER IS FORSAKEN OF ALL
AT FIVE O'CLOCK HE WAS PUNCTUALLY THERE AGAIN AND SENT UP WORD OF HIS ARRIVAL
THE POYSER FOLKS SEE'D THEE IN EM YESTERDAY I WARRAND
LET THE DEAD HEAR THY VOICE
IT WAS AS IF THE THING WERE COME IN SPITE OF HERSELF INSTEAD OF BEING THE OBJECT OF HER SEARCH
HE KNEW TH LAD LIKED TO SIT FULL O THOUGHTS HE COULD GIVE NO ACCOUNT OF
HE GUESSED HE KNEW WHERE THE YOUNG SQUIRE WAS GOING
I NE'ER WANTED FOLKS'S PITY I MY LIFE AFORE...AN I MUN BEGIN TO BE LOOKED DOWN ON NOW AN ME TURNED SEVENTY-TWO LAST ST THOMAS'S AN ALL TH UNDERBEARERS AND PALL-BEARERS AS I'N PICKED FOR MY FUNERAL ARE I THIS PARISH AND THE NEXT TO T....IT'S O NO USE NOW...I MUN BE TA'EN TO THE GRAVE BY STRANGERS DON'T FRET SO FATHER SAID MRS POYSER WHO HAD SPOKEN VERY LITTLE BEING ALMOST OVERAWED BY HER HUSBAND'S UNUSUAL HARDNESS AND DECISION
THERE WAS NO SUNSHINE BUT THE CLOUDS WERE HIGH AND THE WIND WAS SO STILL THAT THE YELLOW LEAVES WHICH FLUTTERED DOWN FROM THE HEDGEROW ELMS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM PURE DECAY
HE WAS A GREAT GENTLEMAN AND COULD HAVE HIS WAY IN EVERYTHING AND COULD BUY EVERYTHING HE LIKED
AND THE SOUND OF THEIR MOVEMENT COMFORTED HER FOR IT ASSURED HER THAT HER IMPRESSION WAS RIGHT--THIS WAS THE FIELD WHERE SHE HAD SEEN THE HOVEL FOR IT WAS THE FIELD WHERE THE SHEEP WERE
AND TO INCREASE THE MISCHIEF ON THIS LAST EVENING HE HAD NOT DARED TO HINT THE TRUTH TO HETTY
IF THEE WAST GOOD FOR ANYTHING THEE'DST MAKE HER COME IN AGAIN O SUNDAY NIGHT WI THEE AND SEE ME ONCE MORE NAY MOTHER SAID SETH
IN THE BROAD SUNLIGHT OF THE GREAT HALL AMONG THE SLEEK SHAVEN FACES OF OTHER MEN THE MARKS OF SUFFERING IN HIS FACE WERE STARTLING EVEN TO MR IRWINE WHO HAD LAST SEEN HIM IN THE DIM LIGHT OF HIS SMALL ROOM
STOP A BIT SAID THE LANDLORD SLOWLY
ALL HONOUR AND REVERENCE TO THE DIVINE BEAUTY OF FORM
HETTY FELT A SENSE OF PROTECTION IN HIS PRESENCE--SHE WAS USED TO IT NOW
HAS SHE GOT A POCKET ON SAID THE CAPTAIN FEELING IN HIS OWN WAISTCOAT POCKETS
DINAH HAD SENT HIM WORD THAT SHE COULD NOT COME TO HIM
FOR IF I GO TO CHURCH MY THOUGHTS ULL BE WITH HER ALL THE WHILE
LAY MY HEAD DOWN HE SAID FAINTLY AND GET ME SOME WATER IF YOU CAN ADAM LAID THE HEAD DOWN GENTLY ON THE FERN AGAIN AND EMPTYING THE TOOLS OUT OF THE FLAG-BASKET HURRIED THROUGH THE TREES TO THE EDGE OF THE GROVE BORDERING ON THE CHASE WHERE A BROOK RAN BELOW THE BANK
THAT'LL COMMODATE YE--IT LAVES YE TH MORE TO DO WITH THIS EXIT SPEECH WHICH HE CONSIDERED EFFECTIVE WIRY BEN SHOULDERED HIS BASKET AND LEFT THE WORKSHOP QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY MUM TAFT AND SANDY JIM
MY HEART CLEAVES TO HER AND HER CHILDREN AS THE NEAREST OF ALL TO ME IN THE FLESH--YEA AND TO ALL IN THAT HOUSE
SHE COULD ENJOY WITHOUT ANY FEAR THE SENSE THAT THIS STRONG BRAVE MAN LOVED HER AND WAS NEAR HER
ONLY TWO WINTERS AGO SHE HAD BEEN LAID UP FOR WEEKS WITH A COLD
IT IS MORE THAN A MONTH SINCE WE SAW HER UNLOCK THAT DRAWER BEFORE AND NOW IT HOLDS NEW TREASURES SO MUCH MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE OLD ONES THAT THESE ARE THRUST INTO THE CORNER
THEN HIS EYEBROWS WOULD BE RAISED AND THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH WOULD QUIVER A LITTLE WITH SAD SYMPATHY--SOMETHING PERHAPS OLD ISAAC'S MEETING WITH HIS SON TOUCHED HIM CLOSELY
IT'S LIKE A BIT O BAD WORKMANSHIP--YOU NEVER SEE TH END O THE MISCHIEF IT'LL DO
WHAT--HETTY
BUT THEN WHY HAD SHE BEEN SO FRIGHTENED ABOUT IT AT FIRST AND CHANGED COLOUR SO AND AFTERWARDS PRETENDED NOT TO CARE
THE FACE WAS LARGE AND ROUGHLY HEWN AND WHEN IN REPOSE HAD NO OTHER BEAUTY THAN SUCH AS BELONGS TO AN EXPRESSION OF GOOD-HUMOURED HONEST INTELLIGENCE
DINAH SPOKE AGAIN IN A TONE MADE STRONGER BY IRREPRESSIBLE EMOTION HETTY...IT'S DINAH AGAIN THERE WAS A SLIGHT STARTLED MOVEMENT THROUGH HETTY'S FRAME AND WITHOUT UNCOVERING HER FACE SHE RAISED HER HEAD A LITTLE AS IF LISTENING
SO HE WENT IN AND MRS POYSER WAS CONTENTED WITH ONLY A SLIGHT REMARK ON HETTY'S BEING LATER THAN WAS EXPECTED
WHY I THINK THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEEN IN HER MIND
THERE WERE ACQUAINTANCES AT OTHER GATES WHO HAD TO MOVE ASIDE AND LET THEM PASS
SHE IS GOING TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE FRIENDS AT THE HALL FARM FOR ME TO GIVE THEM WHEN SHE IS GONE AND WHEN I TOLD HER YOU WERE HERE SHE SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO ADAM AND ASK HIM TO FORGIVE ME YOU WILL COME ADAM
WE MUN TALK
BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S NOBODY HE'S DONE SO MUCH HARM TO AS TO TH OLD SQUIRE
BUT MRS POYSER TOO OFFICIOUSLY TOM THOUGHT INTERFERED TO PREVENT THE EXACTION OF THE PENALTY
TO RIDE IN A SPRING-CART SEEMED A VERY MISERABLE LOT INDEED TO HER NOW
AND IN TWO OR THREE HOURS RIDE THE TRAVELLER MIGHT EXCHANGE A BLEAK TREELESS REGION INTERSECTED BY LINES OF COLD GREY STONE FOR ONE WHERE HIS ROAD WOUND UNDER THE SHELTER OF WOODS OR UP SWELLING HILLS MUFFLED WITH HEDGEROWS AND LONG MEADOW-GRASS AND THICK CORN
BUT SETH SAID NAY MOTHER THEE MUSTNA SAY SO
AN THERE'S NO TRUSTIN THE CHILDREN TO GETHER IT FOR THEY PUT MORE INTO THEIR OWN MOUTHS NOR INTO THE BASKET
SO I WROTE TO HER A FORTNIGHT AGO AND TOLD HER ABOUT THEE HAVING A NEW EMPLOYMENT AND HOW MOTHER WAS MORE CONTENTED
AN THERE'S THE STONE-PITS NOT FAR OFF
HE WAS HAGGARD AND UNSHAVEN AS HE HAD BEEN YESTERDAY BUT HE STOOD UPRIGHT AGAIN AND LOOKED MORE LIKE THE ADAM BEDE OF FORMER DAYS
AND NONE OF HER ADMIRERS WITH WHOM HE WAS ACQUAINTED WAS IN THE POSITION OF AN ACCEPTED LOVER AS THE GIVER OF THAT LOCKET MUST BE
PERHAPS IT HAD ONCE BEEN PRETTY BUT NOW IT WAS WORN AND SALLOW
BLENDS YEARNING AND REPULSION
ADAM'S NIVER TOUCHED A BIT O VICTUAL SIN HOME HE'S COME SAID LISBETH
SHE WAS OBLIGED TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND GO ON
SHE CAN NIVER PLEASE YOU SAID THE MOTHER
HE DIDN'T SET UP FOR BEING SO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FOLKS ONE DAY AND THEN BE AS LIKE EM AS TWO PEAS THE NEXT
HOW OFTEN WOULD I HAVE GATHERED YOU AS A HEN GATHERETH HER CHICKENS UNDER HER WINGS AND YE WOULD NOT!'...AND YE WOULD NOT SHE REPEATED IN A TONE OF PLEADING REPROACH TURNING HER EYES ON THE PEOPLE AGAIN
BUT SHE WAS TAKEN AWAY SEVEN YEARS AGO AND I HAVE NO OTHER KINDRED THAT I KNOW OF BESIDES MY AUNT POYSER WHO IS VERY GOOD TO ME AND WOULD HAVE ME COME AND LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH TO BE SURE IS A GOOD LAND WHEREIN THEY EAT BREAD WITHOUT SCARCENESS
HER HEART MIGHT REALLY TURN TO ADAM AS HE SAID AFTER A WHILE
IT'S A GOOD STEP TO BROX'ON AN IT'S HUNGRY AIR O'ER THE HILL--WI THAT HEAVY COFFIN TOO
HERE WAS A MARKET-TOWN--VERY MUCH LIKE TREDDLESTON--WHERE THE ARMS OF THE NEIGHBOURING LORD OF THE MANOR WERE BORNE ON THE SIGN OF THE PRINCIPAL INN
IT'S QUITE RIGHT THE LAND SHOULD BE PLOUGHED AND SOWED AND THE PRECIOUS CORN STORED AND THE THINGS OF THIS LIFE CARED FOR AND RIGHT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD REJOICE IN THEIR FAMILIES AND PROVIDE FOR THEM SO THAT THIS IS DONE IN THE FEAR OF THE LORD AND THAT THEY ARE NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE SOUL'S WANTS WHILE THEY ARE CARING FOR THE BODY
THEY HEARD THE GURGLING OF THE FULL BROOKLET HURRYING DOWN THE HILL AND THE FAINT TWITTERING OF THE EARLY BIRDS
IT WAS SOON DONE AND THE DARK HYACINTHINE CURVES FELL ON HER NECK
AND PERHAPS I SHALL BE BETTER OFF IN A YEAR OR TWO
ON THE TALL STALWART FRAMES AND ROUGHLY CUT BRONZED FACES OF THE STONE-CUTTERS AND CARPENTERS
EVIDENTLY MAKING HIS WAY TO THE THATCHED HOUSE WITH A STACK OF TIMBER BY THE SIDE OF IT ABOUT TWENTY YARDS UP THE OPPOSITE SLOPE
IT WAS THE KEY OF THE CHAMBER WHERE HER HUSBAND LAY DEAD
THE STARCH HAVING BEEN WIPED UP BY MOLLY'S HELP AND THE IRONING APPARATUS PUT BY MRS POYSER TOOK UP HER KNITTING WHICH ALWAYS LAY READY AT HAND AND WAS THE WORK SHE LIKED BEST BECAUSE SHE COULD CARRY IT ON AUTOMATICALLY AS SHE WALKED TO AND FRO
HE MIGHT HAVE FELT OR WISHED SOMETHING AT THE LAST THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW
TOTTY BE A GOOD DILLING AND GO TO SLEEP NOW SAID MRS POYSER LEANING BACK AND ROCKING THE CHAIR WHILE SHE TRIED TO MAKE TOTTY NESTLE AGAINST HER
I SHANNA REST I MY GRAVE IF I DONNA SEE THEE AT TH LAST
BUT THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THAT
HAS SOMETHING FRIGHTENED YOU HETTY
NO HETTY I CAN'T SAVE YOU FROM THAT DEATH
AND SHE WOULD LOOK JUST THE SAME
AND I DID STRUGGLE
SHE DIDN'T LIKE OUR MARRIAGE WHEN IT CAME NIGH--THAT MUST BE IT SAID ADAM
YOU GO ON DOING YOUR DUTY AS PARISH CLERK AND SEXTON AS WELL AS YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE IT AND MAKING THOSE CAPITAL THICK BOOTS FOR YOUR NEIGHBOURS AND THINGS WON'T GO FAR WRONG IN HAYSLOPE DEPEND UPON IT YOUR REVERENCE IS VERY GOOD TO SAY SO
YES PRETTY WELL
THIS BRAVE ACTIVE MAN WHO WOULD HAVE HASTENED TOWARDS ANY DANGER OR TOIL TO RESCUE HETTY FROM AN APPREHENDED WRONG OR MISFORTUNE FELT HIMSELF POWERLESS TO CONTEMPLATE IRREMEDIABLE EVIL AND SUFFERING
AND WHAT COULD IRWINE DO FOR HIM THAT HE COULD NOT DO FOR HIMSELF
HE SAID
AN I WANT HIM TO GO UPSTAIRS WI ME AFORE IT'S DARK FOR THE MINUTES TO LOOK AT THE CORPSE IS LIKE THE MELTIN SNOW SETH OVERHEARD THIS AND COMING INTO THE KITCHEN AGAIN AS HIS MOTHER ROSE FROM HER CHAIR HE SAID ADAM'S ASLEEP IN THE WORKSHOP MOTHER
THEY WERE ALTOGETHER WRONG AND SUCH AS NO MAN IN ARTHUR'S POSITION OUGHT TO HAVE ALLOWED HIMSELF BUT THEY MUST HAVE HAD AN AIR OF PLAYFULNESS ABOUT THEM WHICH HAD PROBABLY BLINDED HIM TO THEIR DANGER AND HAD PREVENTED THEM FROM LAYING ANY STRONG HOLD ON HETTY'S HEART
FOR ONE SUNDAY WHEN HE WAS INTENDING TO GO FROM CHURCH TO THE HALL FARM HETTY HAD JOINED THE PARTY OF UPPER SERVANTS FROM THE CHASE AND HAD GONE HOME WITH THEM--ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE INCLINED TO ENCOURAGE MR CRAIG
THE OLD INDIGNATION AND JEALOUSY ROSE AGAIN AND PROMPTED THE SUSPICION THAT ARTHUR HAD BEEN DEALING FALSELY--HAD WRITTEN TO HETTY--HAD TEMPTED HER TO COME TO HIM--BEING UNWILLING AFTER ALL THAT SHE SHOULD BELONG TO ANOTHER MAN BESIDES HIMSELF
AND IT MADE A STRANGE CONTRAST TO SEE THAT SPARKLING SELF-ENGROSSED LOVELINESS LOOKED AT BY DINAH'S CALM PITYING FACE WITH ITS OPEN GLANCE WHICH TOLD THAT HER HEART LIVED IN NO CHERISHED SECRETS OF ITS OWN BUT IN FEELINGS WHICH IT LONGED TO SHARE WITH ALL THE WORLD
SHE ALWAYS GAVE ADAM THIS TITLE WHEN SHE RECEIVED HIM IN HER OWN HOUSE
BUT I'M NOT FREE TO LEAVE SNOWFIELD WHERE I WAS FIRST PLANTED AND HAVE GROWN DEEP INTO IT LIKE THE SMALL GRASS ON THE HILL-TOP AH I DARESAY YOU HAVE MANY RELIGIOUS FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS THERE
BUT I MUST HAVE SLEPT A LONG WHILE AT LAST THOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW FOR WHEN I GOT UP AND WENT OUT OF THE BARN I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS NIGHT OR MORNING
NEVER MIND THE BEADS ADAM HAD ALREADY SEEN WHERE THE LOCKET FELL FOR IT HAD ATTRACTED HIS GLANCE AS IT LEAPED OUT OF HER FROCK
SO HE TURNED WITH RATHER A HEAVY HEART INTO THE HOUSE-PLACE
CONTRAIRY MOTHER ADAM SAID LOOKING UP AGAIN IN SOME ANXIETY
JESUS CHRIST DID REALLY COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AS I LIKE A SILLY CHILD THOUGHT MR WESLEY DID
AND DINAH WAITED FOR HER HEART WAS SO FULL THAT TEARS MUST COME BEFORE WORDS
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING AT WHY SHE'S BEEN WANTING TO GO FOR A LADY'S MAID SAID MR POYSER
AND HE HAD BEEN BUSY SINCE EARLY MORNING WITH THE PACKING OF PANELS DOORS AND CHIMNEY-PIECES IN A WAGGON WHICH WAS NOW GONE ON BEFORE HIM WHILE JONATHAN BURGE HIMSELF HAD RIDDEN TO THE SPOT ON HORSEBACK TO AWAIT ITS ARRIVAL AND DIRECT THE WORKMEN
ADAM SAID TAKE MY ARM DINAH AND SHE TOOK IT
I THINK THERE CAN BE NO MAN HERE WHO HAS NOT A RESPECT AND SOME OF YOU I AM SURE HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR MY FRIEND ADAM BEDE
AH SAID MRS POYSER REALLY FORGETTING ALL DISCIPLINE IN THIS PLEASANT SURPRISE THAT'S A GOOD LAD
COULD YOU TELL ME WHICH WAY TO GO TO THIS PLACE HERE HETTY TOOK FROM HER POCKET A BIT OF PAPER
EVERY TENANT WAS QUITE SURE THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT WHEN THE REINS GOT INTO HIS HANDS--THERE WAS TO BE A MILLENNIAL ABUNDANCE OF NEW GATES ALLOWANCES OF LIME AND RETURNS OF TEN PER CENT
FOR WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH ALIKE WHEN WE ARE IN OUR FIRST LOVE
MISERABLE ABOUT THIS LETTER THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO WRITE AND THAT SEEMED AT ONE MOMENT TO BE A GROSS BARBARITY AT ANOTHER PERHAPS THE GREATEST KINDNESS HE COULD DO TO HER
ALL MR BURGE'S MEN HAD A HOLIDAY AND ALL MR POYSER'S AND MOST OF THOSE WHO HAD A HOLIDAY APPEARED IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES AT THE WEDDING
SUCH BIG ARMS AS MINE WERE MADE FOR LITTLE ARMS LIKE YOURS TO LEAN ON HETTY SMILED FAINTLY AND PUT HER ARM WITHIN HIS
ALL HER LITTLE WORKWOMAN'S MATTERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE PATH SOME OF THEM SHOWING A CAPABILITY OF ROLLING TO GREAT LENGTHS
ADAM HIMSELF WAS NOT COME BACK FROM STONITON FOR THOUGH HE SHRANK FROM SEEING HETTY HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GO TO A DISTANCE FROM HER AGAIN
THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD DIED NATURALLY AND THEN SHE HAD HIDDEN IT
MR IRWINE'S TESTIMONY WAS NOT TO BE DISPUTED
BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE I'VE NOT ASKED ABOUT EM AT TH HALL FARM SIR
EH WE SHOULD HA BEEN BOTH FLUNG AWAY TOGETHER AN THEN I SHOULDNA HA SEEN THIS DAY AN ONE BURYIN UD HA DONE FOR US BOTH HERE LISBETH PAUSED BUT ADAM SAT IN PAINED SILENCE--HE COULD NOT SPEAK OTHERWISE THAN TENDERLY TO HIS MOTHER TO-DAY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP BEING IRRITATED BY THIS PLAINT
IF ONLY THE CORN WERE NOT RIPE ENOUGH TO BE BLOWN OUT OF THE HUSK AND SCATTERED AS UNTIMELY SEED
AND IT'S A FEELING AS GIVES YOU A SORT O LIBERTY AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER THAN Y HAVE IN YOURSELF
A WHISPER IS UNKNOWN AMONG THEM AND THEY SEEM ALMOST AS INCAPABLE OF AN UNDERTONE AS A COW OR A STAG
IF THERE'S BEEN ANY CRIME IT'S AT HIS DOOR NOT AT HERS
BUT NOW HER SLIM FIGURE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN AND HER PALE SERENE FACE IMPRESSED HIM WITH ALL THE FORCE THAT BELONGS TO A REALITY CONTRASTED WITH A PREOCCUPYING FANCY
OR ARE NOT THOSE THE BEST WHICH COME FROM THEIR FULLER THOUGHT THEIR LARGER EXPERIENCE THEIR DEEPER-ROOTED AFFECTIONS
I'M GETTING VERY THIRSTY IN HALF AN HOUR ALL WAS QUIET
I'VE HAD TO DO WITH SUCH FOLKS IN MY TIME--IN THE SOUTH WHEN I WAS IN TROUBLE MYSELF
DEAR HETTY SHE SAID IT HAS BEEN BORNE IN UPON MY MIND TO-NIGHT THAT YOU MAY SOME DAY BE IN TROUBLE--TROUBLE IS APPOINTED FOR US ALL HERE BELOW AND THERE COMES A TIME WHEN WE NEED MORE COMFORT AND HELP THAN THE THINGS OF THIS LIFE CAN GIVE
KATE SAYS SHE HAS ONE OF HER WORST HEADACHES THIS MORNING OH SHE LIKES ME TO GO AND SEE HER JUST THE SAME
SHE ENTREATED ME NOT TO STAY LONG AWAY
DINAH MIGHT BE OUT ON SOME PREACHING ERRAND AND PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HETTY AT HOME
SHE COULD SEE A REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THE OLD-FASHIONED LOOKING-GLASS QUITE AS DISTINCT AS WAS NEEDFUL CONSIDERING THAT SHE HAD ONLY TO BRUSH HER HAIR AND PUT ON HER NIGHT-CAP
HE HAD HIDDEN HIS FACE ON HIS ARM WHICH RESTED ON THE BOARDING IN FRONT OF HIM
I WAR GONE THIRTY AN TH FEYTHER TOO AFORE WE WAR MARRIED
BUT SHE IS NOT PLACIDLY CONTEMPLATING THE EVENING SUNSHINE
PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS MAKING THE LEAVES RUSTLE
MR CRAIG HAD FOUND NO ANSWER BUT SUCH AS WAS IMPLIED IN TAKING A LONG DRAUGHT OF ALE AND THEN LOOKING DOWN FIXEDLY AT THE PROPORTIONS OF HIS OWN LEG WHICH HE TURNED A LITTLE OUTWARD FOR THAT PURPOSE WHEN BARTLE MASSEY RETURNED FROM THE FIREPLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE IN QUIET AND BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING AS HE THRUST HIS FOREFINGER INTO THE CANISTER WHY ADAM HOW HAPPENED YOU NOT TO BE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY
SHAKE OFF DULL SLOTH
FOR THERE IS NO DESPAIR SO ABSOLUTE AS THAT WHICH COMES WITH THE FIRST MOMENTS OF OUR FIRST GREAT SORROW WHEN WE HAVE NOT YET KNOWN WHAT IT IS TO HAVE SUFFERED AND BE HEALED TO HAVE DESPAIRED AND TO HAVE RECOVERED HOPE
I WAS LONGER THAN I MEANT TO BE FOR I HAD TO WAIT FOR THE WOMAN THAT CAME BACK WITH ME
STILL I HAVE INTERESTED MYSELF A GOOD DEAL IN SUCH MATTERS AND LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS MY OPPORTUNITIES HAVE ALLOWED
THERE WAS NO KEENNESS IN THE EYES
IT WAS ALWAYS LIKELY HE SHOULD SAY WHAT HE DID SAY
I SHALL OVERRUN THESE DOINGS BEFORE LONG
WHAT A KIND HEART HE MUST HAVE
IT'S A PITY YE DIDNA KNOW SHE SAID
I COULD AFFORD TO BE MARRIED NOW HETTY--I COULD MAKE A WIFE COMFORTABLE
AND SO THE TIME PASSED PLEASANTLY TILL ADAM GOT UP TO GO
BUT TOWARDS THE WRIST SHE THOUGHT WITH VEXATION THAT THEY WERE COARSENED BY BUTTER-MAKING AND OTHER WORK THAT LADIES NEVER DID
AND REMEMBERING THAT JONATHAN BURGE HAD SOME REASON TO FEEL HURT TO-DAY HE RESOLVED TO ASK MISS MARY TO DANCE WITH HIM THE FIRST DANCE IF SHE HAD NO OTHER PARTNER
AND YOU SHALL HEAR NOW WHAT THEY HAD BEEN SAYING TO EACH OTHER
AND SHE WOULD TAKE OUT THE LITTLE EAR-RINGS SHE HAD IN HER EARS--OH HOW HER AUNT HAD SCOLDED HER FOR HAVING HER EARS BORED!--AND PUT IN THOSE LARGE ONES
IT HAD GOT COMFORTABLE CLOTHES ON BUT ITS BODY WAS COLD AND I THOUGHT IT MUST BE DEAD
SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT HE SAID STILL WITHOUT MOVING HIS EYES AS IF HE WERE ONLY TALKING TO HIMSELF
TELL ME EVERYTHING HERE IS A LETTER FROM THE MAGISTRATE BEFORE WHOM SHE WAS TAKEN AND THE CONSTABLE WHO ARRESTED HER IS IN THE DINING-ROOM
IT'S A GREAT THING TO HA STUDIED THE LOOK O THE CLOUDS
AN THE NIGHT-SCHOOL'S NOT OVER YET
FOR SHE'S ONE O THEM THINGS AS LOOKS THE BRIGHTEST ON A RAINY DAY AND LOVES YOU THE BEST WHEN YOU'RE MOST I NEED ON'T MRS POYSER YOU PERCEIVE WAS AWARE THAT NOTHING WOULD BE SO LIKELY TO EXPEL THE COMIC AS THE TERRIBLE
MR IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MR POYSER WHO WITH HIS HANDS STILL BUSY IN HIS POCKETS BEGAN WITH THE DELIBERATENESS OF A SLOW-STRIKING CLOCK
HE WILL IF HE'S WISE NAY SIR I DON'T SEE AS HE'D BE MUCH THE BETTER OFF FOR THAT
HE HAS INDEPENDENCE OF SPIRIT ENOUGH FOR TWO MEN--RATHER AN EXCESS OF PRIDE IF ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE A CAPITAL MATCH FOR ADAM
I'M NOT FOR LAUGHING AT NO MAN'S RELIGION
SHE THOUGHT OF NOTHING THAT WAS PRESENT
I WAS AFRAID OF THE FEVER AND I THOUGHT I'D CALL AND ASK AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE AN EXPERIENCED WOMAN TO COME BACK WITH ME WHEN I WENT OUT
ADAM CARED FOR NO WORDS AFTER THAT AND THEY HARDLY SPOKE THROUGH THE REST OF THE WALK
SHE'S GONE AWAY SIR AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
SHE MADE NO ODDS IN TH HOUSE AT ALL FOR SHE SAT AS STILL AT HER SEWING AS A BIRD ON THE NEST AND WAS UNCOMMON NIMBLE AT RUNNING TO FETCH ANYTHING
THE TOWN LAY GRIM STONY AND UNSHELTERED UP THE SIDE OF A STEEP HILL AND ADAM DID NOT GO FORWARD TO IT AT PRESENT FOR SETH HAD TOLD HIM WHERE TO FIND DINAH
THE DISCOVERY THAT ADAM LOVED HETTY WAS A SHOCK WHICH MADE HIM FOR THE MOMENT SEE HIMSELF IN THE LIGHT OF ADAM'S INDIGNATION AND REGARD ADAM'S SUFFERING AS NOT MERELY A CONSEQUENCE BUT AN ELEMENT OF HIS ERROR
BY THE BY WHAT'S HER OTHER NAME
AND ADAM IS LIKE THE PATRIARCH JOSEPH FOR HIS GREAT SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE AND THE KINDNESS HE SHOWS TO HIS BROTHER AND HIS PARENTS PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW THE TROUBLE THAT HAS JUST HAPPENED TO THEM
NOW THAT HETTY HAD DONE HER DUTY AND DANCED ONE DANCE WITH THE YOUNG SQUIRE MR POYSER MUST GO OUT AND SEE IF THE CART WAS COME BACK TO FETCH THEM FOR IT WAS HALF-PAST TEN O'CLOCK AND NOTWITHSTANDING A MILD SUGGESTION ON HIS PART THAT IT WOULD BE BAD MANNERS FOR THEM TO BE THE FIRST TO GO MRS POYSER WAS RESOLUTE ON THE POINT MANNERS OR NO MANNERS WHAT
BUT TELL ME FIRST HAVE YOU HEARD ANY PARTICULAR NEWS TO-DAY NO SAID ADAM NOT AS I REMEMBER AH THEY'LL KEEP IT CLOSE THEY'LL KEEP IT CLOSE I DARESAY
AND WHEN WE GOT THERE THERE WAS THE PRISONER A-SITTING AGAINST THE BUSH WHERE I FOUND THE CHILD
FOR ST PAUL SAYS AS PLAIN AS CAN BE IN ANOTHER PLACE I WILL THAT THE YOUNGER WOMEN MARRY BEAR CHILDREN GUIDE THE HOUSE GIVE NONE OCCASION TO THE ADVERSARY TO SPEAK REPROACHFULLY
BUT TO-MORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF I'LL GO TO WORK AGAIN
HE WAS SHOWN INTO THE STUDY WHERE MR IRWINE SOON JOINED HIM
THERE'S MRS FLETCHER AS SHE TALKS OF A NEW LIGHT HAD BROKEN IN ON SETH
IN SPITE OF HIS WISDOM HE COULD NOT FIND FAULT WITH HER FOR HER OVERINDULGENCE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD MANAGED TO CONVERT DINAH THE PREACHER BEFORE WHOM A CIRCLE OF ROUGH MEN HAD OFTEN TREMBLED A LITTLE INTO A CONVENIENT HOUSEHOLD SLAVE--THOUGH DINAH HERSELF WAS RATHER ASHAMED OF THIS WEAKNESS AND HAD SOME INWARD CONFLICT AS TO HER DEPARTURE FROM THE PRECEPTS OF SOLOMON
I DON'T EXPECT THAT MRS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE
AND THIS MORNING WHEN I OPENED THE BIBLE FOR DIRECTION THE FIRST WORDS MY EYES FELL ON WERE AND AFTER WE HAD SEEN THE VISION IMMEDIATELY WE ENDEAVOURED TO GO INTO MACEDONIA IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT CLEAR SHOWING OF THE LORD'S WILL I SHOULD BE LOATH TO GO FOR MY HEART YEARNS OVER MY AUNT AND HER LITTLE ONES AND THAT POOR WANDERING LAMB HETTY SORREL
THOSE HAVE BEEN VERY BLESSED YEARS TO ME AND I FEEL THAT IF I WAS TO LISTEN TO ANY VOICE THAT WOULD DRAW ME ASIDE FROM THAT PATH I SHOULD BE TURNING MY BACK ON THE LIGHT THAT HAS SHONE UPON ME AND DARKNESS AND DOUBT WOULD TAKE HOLD OF ME
IT'LL PERHAPS BE THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMOR IN SETH'S VOICE
IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION
ETERNAL BEAM OF LIGHT DIVINE FOUNTAIN OF UNEXHAUSTED LOVE IN WHOM THE FATHER'S GLORIES SHINE THROUGH EARTH BENEATH AND HEAVEN ABOVE
SHE WOULD SCARCELY LISTEN TO READING AT ALL TO-NIGHT
THEE'T BRING ON THE PAIN IN THY SIDE AGAIN WELL SHE MAY HOLD HER IF THE CHILD ULL GO TO HER SAID MRS POYSER
NAY HE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL MORE FOR ADAM THAN HE SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ESTATE
MRS FLETCHER AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO PREACH IN THE SOCIETY I BELIEVE BEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED WHEN SHE WAS MISS BOSANQUET
SHE'LL KNOW NOTHIN O NARROWIN AN HEELIN I WARRAND AN SHE'LL MAKE A LONG TOE AS HE CANNA GET'S BOOT ON
IT WAS IN MR IRWINE'S HANDWRITING ARTHUR SAW AT ONCE
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING IT OVER AGAIN BY NIGHT AND BY DAY AND I'VE PRAYED NOT TO BE BLINDED BY MY OWN DESIRES TO THINK WHAT'S ONLY GOOD FOR ME MUST BE GOOD FOR YOU TOO
I'M AFRAID SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO HER
YOU WOULD HAVE SOME EXCUSE THEN FOR TRYING TO MAKE THE EVIL WORSE
AND POOR FELLOW HE STILL BELIEVES HETTY IS INNOCENT--HE WANTS TO SUMMON UP COURAGE TO SEE HER IF HE CAN
THEE ALLAYS MAKES A PECK O THY OWN WORDS OUT O A PINT O THE BIBLE'S
MAYBE HE WONNA COME AT ALL TO-NIGHT
I LOST MY WAY SHE SAID
HE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD HE IS PRAYING FOR YOU AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD--'FATHER FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO AND HE IS UPON THIS EARTH TOO
ALICK SAID EVERYBODY WAS GONE TO CHURCH BUT TH YOUNG MISSIS"--SO HE CALLED DINAH--BUT THIS DID NOT DISAPPOINT ADAM ALTHOUGH THE EVERYBODY WAS SO LIBERAL AS TO INCLUDE NANCY THE DAIRYMAID WHOSE WORKS OF NECESSITY WERE NOT UNFREQUENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH CHURCH-GOING
BUT PERHAPS IF I PUT SARAH WILLIAMSON METHODIST PREACHER LEEDS O TH OUTSIDE IT MIGHT GET TO HER
THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN AMUSEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OR IF IT BECAME SERIOUS THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO MARRIAGE
IF WE'VE GOT A RESOLUTION TO DO RIGHT HE GAVE IT US I RECKON FIRST OR LAST
HAPPEN YE CAN TELL ME SETH IF SO BE AS I SHOULDNA COME UP I TIME FOR'T
IT IS THY WILL THAT I SHOULD PART FROM THEM
YOU CAN SEE TO THE CHILD
I WAS CALLED AWAY TO THOLER'S FUNERAL JUST WHEN I WAS GOING BEFORE IT'S OF NO USE CHILD
BUT SHE WOULDNA THINK WELL IF THEE WASTNA SO CONTRAIRY LISBETH DARED NOT VENTURE BEYOND A VAGUE PHRASE YET
AND THEY'RE POOR FOOLISH QUESTIONS AFTER ALL
AND ANOTHER TIME I CAME NOT TO CALL THE RIGHTEOUS BUT SINNERS TO REPENTANCE THE LOST!...SINNERS!...AH DEAR FRIENDS DOES THAT MEAN YOU AND ME HITHERTO THE TRAVELLER HAD BEEN CHAINED TO THE SPOT AGAINST HIS WILL BY THE CHARM OF DINAH'S MELLOW TREBLE TONES WHICH HAD A VARIETY OF MODULATION LIKE THAT OF A FINE INSTRUMENT TOUCHED WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS SKILL OF MUSICAL INSTINCT
HE HAD NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
BUT SHE WILL USE THE WATCH--I SHALL LIKE TO THINK OF HER USING IT I'LL GIVE IT TO HER SIR ADAM SAID AND TELL HER YOUR WORDS
THE DONNITHORNE ARMS STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE VILLAGE AND A SMALL FARMYARD AND STACKYARD WHICH FLANKED IT INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A PRETTY TAKE OF LAND ATTACHED TO THE INN GAVE THE TRAVELLER A PROMISE OF GOOD FEED FOR HIMSELF AND HIS HORSE WHICH MIGHT WELL CONSOLE HIM FOR THE IGNORANCE IN WHICH THE WEATHER-BEATEN SIGN LEFT HIM AS TO THE HERALDIC BEARINGS OF THAT ANCIENT FAMILY THE DONNITHORNES
IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE BUSINESS ALTOGETHER BUT THERE WAS NO USE IN MAKING IT WORSE THAN IT WAS BY IMAGINARY EXAGGERATIONS AND FOREBODINGS OF EVIL THAT MIGHT NEVER COME
BUT HE WAS LESS OF A FAVOURITE WITH MRS POYSER WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE SAID IN CONFIDENCE TO HER HUSBAND YOU'RE MIGHTY FOND O CRAIG BUT FOR MY PART I THINK HE'S WELLY LIKE A COCK AS THINKS THE SUN'S ROSE O PURPOSE TO HEAR HIM CROW FOR THE REST MR CRAIG WAS AN ESTIMABLE GARDENER AND WAS NOT WITHOUT REASONS FOR HAVING A HIGH OPINION OF HIMSELF
AFTER THAT PAUSE HE STRODE ON AGAIN ALONG THE BROAD WINDING PATH THROUGH THE GROVE
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME BY A GREAT MANY HE SAID THAT I HAVE HAD TO THANK MY PARISHIONERS FOR GIVING ME TOKENS OF THEIR GOODWILL BUT NEIGHBOURLY KINDNESS IS AMONG THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THE MORE PRECIOUS THE OLDER THEY GET
THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE CONCERNED BESIDES ME A GLEAM OF SOMETHING--IT WAS ALMOST LIKE RELIEF OR JOY--CAME ACROSS THE EAGER ANXIETY OF MR IRWINE'S FACE AT THAT MOMENT
I GOT SOMETHING TO EAT THERE AND BOUGHT A LOAF
DINAH BELIEVING THAT THIS PAUSE OF WONDER WAS IN ITSELF A RELIEF FOR THE SORROWING WOMAN SAID NO MORE JUST YET BUT QUIETLY TOOK OFF HER BONNET AND THEN MOTIONING SILENCE TO SETH WHO ON HEARING HER VOICE HAD COME IN WITH A BEATING HEART LAID ONE HAND ON THE BACK OF LISBETH'S CHAIR AND LEANED OVER HER THAT SHE MIGHT BE AWARE OF A FRIENDLY PRESENCE
SHE WALKED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO WARM HERSELF BEGINNING TO DISCERN SOMETHING OF THE OBJECTS AROUND HER AS HER EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE NIGHT--THE DARKER LINE OF THE HEDGE THE RAPID MOTION OF SOME LIVING CREATURE--PERHAPS A FIELD-MOUSE--RUSHING ACROSS THE GRASS
GOD KNOWS I'D HA BORNE A GOOD DEAL WORSE FOR THE SAKE O SPARING IT YOU
NO SAID ARTHUR DIP MY CRAVAT IN AND SOUSE IT ON MY HEAD THE WATER SEEMED TO DO HIM SOME GOOD FOR HE PRESENTLY RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE HIGHER RESTING ON ADAM'S ARM
BUT THOU DIDST SPEAK TO HER THOU DIDST TEACH HER THOU DIDST SHOW HER THAT HER LIFE LAY OPEN BEFORE THEE AND YET THOU WAST READY TO GIVE HER THAT BLESSING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER SOUGHT
YE WAR AFINDING FAUT WI PREACHERS A WHILE AGOO--Y ARE FOND ENOUGH O PREACHIN YOURSEN
SHE WAS NOT IN BLACK THIS MORNING FOR HER AUNT POYSER WOULD BY NO MEANS ALLOW SUCH A RISK OF INCURRING BAD LUCK AND HAD HERSELF MADE A PRESENT OF THE WEDDING DRESS MADE ALL OF GREY THOUGH IN THE USUAL QUAKER FORM FOR ON THIS POINT DINAH COULD NOT GIVE WAY
HAVING TAKEN OFF HER GOWN AND WHITE KERCHIEF SHE DREW A KEY FROM THE LARGE POCKET THAT HUNG OUTSIDE HER PETTICOAT AND UNLOCKING ONE OF THE LOWER DRAWERS IN THE CHEST REACHED FROM IT TWO SHORT BITS OF WAX CANDLE--SECRETLY BOUGHT AT TREDDLESTON--AND STUCK THEM IN THE TWO BRASS SOCKETS
AND YET THERE'S NO TELLING--SHE MAY TURN ROUND THE OTHER WAY WHEN SHE FINDS HE'S MADE LIGHT OF HER ALL THE WHILE
I'M LISTENING AND LISTENING--I CAN'T THINK O NOTHING BUT THAT
THOUGH THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S QUIET ENOUGH TO LOOK AT BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT
HERE WAS A NEW TROUBLE WHICH HAD NOT ENTERED INTO HER SAD THOUGHTS BEFORE AND QUITE WEIGHED DOWN BY THIS SUDDEN ADDITION TO HER BURDEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE STEP OF A STILE AND BEGAN TO SOB HYSTERICALLY
HE CARED TO SAY NO MORE--HE HAD THROWN QUITE DUST ENOUGH INTO HONEST ADAM'S EYES--AND AS HE SPOKE THE LAST WORDS HE WALKED ON
HETTY WAS GUILTY
SHE'D MAKE IT EASIER DYIN'--SHE SPAKES SO GENTLE AN MOVES ABOUT SO STILL
I TELL HER WE CAN DO BETTER FOR HER NOR THAT I THOUGHT SHE'D GOT SOME MAGGOT IN HER HEAD SHE'S GONE ABOUT WI HER MOUTH BUTTONED UP SO ALL DAY
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH O THE SCOTCH TUNES TO LAST ME WHILE I LIVE
BUT OUR BLESSED SAVIOUR HAS SHOWED US WHAT GOD IS IN A WAY US POOR IGNORANT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND
OTHERS HOWEVER MAY RATHER MAINTAIN THAT THIS VERY ITERATION IS AN ORIGINAL FELICITY TO WHICH NONE BUT THE MOST PROSAIC MINDS CAN BE INSENSIBLE
I'LL STAY WITH YOU TO THE LAST....BUT HETTY THERE IS SOME ONE ELSE IN THIS CELL BESIDES ME SOME ONE CLOSE TO YOU HETTY SAID IN A FRIGHTENED WHISPER WHO SOME ONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH YOU THROUGH ALL YOUR HOURS OF SIN AND TROUBLE--WHO HAS KNOWN EVERY THOUGHT YOU HAVE HAD--HAS SEEN WHERE YOU WENT WHERE YOU LAY DOWN AND ROSE UP AGAIN AND ALL THE DEEDS YOU HAVE TRIED TO HIDE IN DARKNESS
AND HE WISHED TO ENTER WITHOUT AWAKING HIS MOTHER FOR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID TELLING HER THE NEW TROUBLE HIMSELF BY SEEING SETH FIRST AND ASKING HIM TO TELL HER WHEN IT SHOULD BE NECESSARY
IT IS SIN THAT BRINGS DREAD AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR
AND AFTER ALL WHAT HAD HE DONE
DID YOU FIND THEM QUIET AND ATTENTIVE VERY QUIET SIR BUT I SAW NO SIGNS OF ANY GREAT WORK UPON THEM EXCEPT IN A YOUNG GIRL NAMED BESSY CRANAGE TOWARDS WHOM MY HEART YEARNED GREATLY WHEN MY EYES FIRST FELL ON HER BLOOMING YOUTH GIVEN UP TO FOLLY AND VANITY
YOU NUVER KNEW A FARMER BITTEN WI THEM MAGGOTS
I'LL HOLD IT TILL YOU'RE READY TO TAKE IT HE ADDED QUIETLY CLOSING HIS HAND OVER IT THAT SHE MIGHT NOT THINK HE WANTED TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN
YES ADDY BUT IT'S WHAT MUST BE BORNE AND CAN'T BE HELPED
I'D HAVE GIVEN UP FIGURES FOR EVER ONLY TO HAVE HAD SOME GOOD NEWS TO BRING TO YOU MY POOR LAD BUT DOES IT SEEM TO BE GOING AGAINST HER SAID ADAM
THEN WE SHALL SEE AT A GLANCE WHOM WE ARE TO CONDEMN AND WHOM WE ARE TO APPROVE
TH HOURS WAR NE'ER SO LONG SIN I WAR BORN AS THEY'N BEEN THIS BLESSED SUNDAY NIGHT
THE PARSON TALKS O FOLKS PITYING US
ONLY I THINK IT UD BE BETTER IF THEIR CONSCIENCES UD LET EM STAY QUIET I THE CHURCH--THERE'S A DEAL TO BE LEARNT THERE
HETTY WOULD NOT BE FAR OFF AND ADAM ALREADY FELT AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING AT HIM
I FEEL SURE IT WOULD BE SO WITH ADAM BEDE
YOU DON'T SEE SUCH WOMEN TURNED OFF THE WHEEL EVERY DAY EH THEE'T ALLAYS STICK UP FOR THY BROTHER
THEY LOOKED SO SIMPLE SO CANDID SO GRAVELY LOVING THAT NO ACCUSING SCOWL NO LIGHT SNEER COULD HELP MELTING AWAY BEFORE THEIR GLANCE
HAPPEN I SHALL DO THE COORTIN AN THE RELIGION BOTH TOGETHER AS YE DO SETH
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY--THE BEST MANAGER IN THE PARISH IS SHE NOT MR POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT-SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT BEFORE THE SMALL WIRY COOL OLD GENTLEMAN HE LOOKED LIKE A PRIZE APPLE BY THE SIDE OF A WITHERED CRAB
A NIGHT'S SLEEP MORE OR LESS
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN AND THEY ARE NOT THE COMMONEST OF WHOM WE CAN KNOW THE BEST ONLY BY FOLLOWING THEM AWAY FROM THE MARKETPLACE THE PLATFORM AND THE PULPIT ENTERING WITH THEM INTO THEIR OWN HOMES HEARING THE VOICE WITH WHICH THEY SPEAK TO THE YOUNG AND AGED ABOUT THEIR OWN HEARTHSTONE AND WITNESSING THEIR THOUGHTFUL CARE FOR THE EVERYDAY WANTS OF EVERYDAY COMPANIONS WHO TAKE ALL THEIR KINDNESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND NOT AS A SUBJECT FOR PANEGYRIC
BUT WHEN HE WENT ON HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND LOOKED STRAIGHT AT MR IRWINE
THEN CAME THE VALLEY WHERE THE WOODS GREW THICKER AS IF THEY HAD ROLLED DOWN AND HURRIED TOGETHER FROM THE PATCHES LEFT SMOOTH ON THE SLOPE THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE THE BETTER CARE OF THE TALL MANSION WHICH LIFTED ITS PARAPETS AND SENT ITS FAINT BLUE SUMMER SMOKE AMONG THEM
IT CUTS ONE SADLY TO SEE THE GRIEF OF OLD PEOPLE
ADAM LIKED WHAT DINAH HAD SAID SO MUCH THAT HIS MIND WAS DIRECTLY FULL OF THE NEXT VISIT HE SHOULD PAY TO THE HALL FARM WHEN HETTY WOULD PERHAPS BEHAVE MORE KINDLY TO HIM THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
CAST IT OFF NOW HETTY--NOW
I KNOW THEIR FEELING ABOUT DISGRACE--MR IRWINE HAS TOLD ME ALL
IT'S NOT TO BE NAMED BY SIDE O THE SCOTCH TUNES
YOU'RE NEVER EASY TILL YOU'VE GOT SOME SWEETHEART AS IS AS BIG A FOOL AS YOURSELF
HE WAS PRESENTING THE SORT OF RESISTANCE THAT WAS THE MOST IRRITATING TO ARTHUR'S EAGER ARDENT NATURE
HASN'T HE DONE THE COFFIN FOR THOLER
THERE LAY THE LETTER
IT HAS STOOD PERHAPS BY THE CLUSTERING APPLE-BLOSSOMS OR IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE BY THE CORNFIELD OR AT A TURNING BY THE WOOD WHERE A CLEAR BROOK WAS GURGLING BELOW
THE METHODISTS CAN SELDOM LAY MUCH HOLD ON THEM WHY SIR THERE'S A PRETTY LOT O WORKMEN ROUND ABOUT SIR
I KNOW YOU WORK FOR HIM AS WELL AS IF YOU WERE WORKING FOR YOURSELF
DRINK A DROP WITH ME MY LAD--DRINK WITH ME ADAM PUSHED THE CUP GENTLY AWAY AND SAID ENTREATINGLY TELL ME ABOUT IT MR MASSEY--TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
NO YOUNG WOMAN LIKE HETTY HAD BEEN SEEN THERE
AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE
AND HOW COULD HE TELL THEM WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE A FOOL
I'M LATE ADAM HE SAID SITTING DOWN ON THE CHAIR WHICH BARTLE PLACED FOR HIM BUT I WAS LATER IN SETTING OFF FROM BROXTON THAN I INTENDED TO BE AND I HAVE BEEN INCESSANTLY OCCUPIED SINCE I ARRIVED
IT'S ILL GUESSING WHAT THE BATS ARE FLYING AFTER WHY WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO YOU
FOR CHAD WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SAY THAT A WORKING-MAN MUST HOLD A CANDLE TO A PERSONAGE UNDERSTOOD TO BE AS BLACK AS HE WAS HIMSELF ON WEEKDAYS
THE WOMAN AS MARRIES HIM ULL HAVE A GOOD TAKE BE'T LADY DAY OR MICHAELMAS A REMARK WHICH MRS POYSER ALWAYS FOLLOWED UP WITH HER CORDIAL ASSENT
SETH LAD ADAM SAID PUTTING HIS ARM ON HIS BROTHER'S SHOULDER HAST HEARD ANYTHING FROM DINAH MORRIS SINCE SHE WENT AWAY YES SAID SETH
FOR EXCEPT THAT HE HAD A STRONGER BURR IN HIS ACCENT HIS SPEECH DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THAT OF THE LOAMSHIRE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM
SHE LIKED THE PASTURE BEST WHERE THE MILCH COWS WERE LYING AND NEXT TO THAT THE MEADOW WHERE THE GRASS WAS HALF-MOWN AND LAY IN SILVERED SWEEPING LINES
HE WOULD WANT TO MARRY HER AND MAKE A LADY OF HER
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING HIS TUTOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE NATURALLY HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF KNOWING HIM INTIMATELY WHICH CANNOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE ELSE WHO IS PRESENT
THERE WAS MUCH SHAKING OF HANDS MINGLED WITH GOD BLESS YOU'S AND OTHER GOOD WISHES TO THE FOUR COUPLES AT THE CHURCHYARD GATE MR POYSER ANSWERING FOR THE REST WITH UNWONTED VIVACITY OF TONGUE FOR HE HAD ALL THE APPROPRIATE WEDDING-DAY JOKES AT HIS COMMAND
HE REALLY HAD NO VERY LOFTY AIMS NO THEOLOGICAL ENTHUSIASM
WHY YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY I SEE MR MASSEY SAID ADAM SMILING AS HE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING PASSING THE LOVE OF WOMEN AS I FEEL FOR YOU FOR I COULD BE CONTENT WITHOUT YOUR MARRYING ME IF I COULD GO AND LIVE AT SNOWFIELD AND BE NEAR YOU
I'D AS SOON SHE LIVED WITH US AS NOT HETTY'S MIND WAS OPPRESSED AT THAT MOMENT WITH A WORSE DIFFICULTY THAN POOR LISBETH'S WAYS
NO MOTION NO SOUND NEAR
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN HER AS I COULD SEE WHEN SHE TOOK TO THE METHODISTS ONLY SHE TALKED A BIT DIFFERENT AND WORE A DIFFERENT SORT O CAP
AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS COULD BE TILL HE WENT TO SLEEP--AND THE MOTHER CRIED TO SEE HIM IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULDNA BE A MOTHER HERSELF SAID ADAM SO FOND AS THE CHILDREN ARE OF HER
IT'S WELL IF THEY GET ONYBODY AS LL MAKE PARRIDGE AT ALL
THERE'S TOO MANY WOMEN IN THE HOUSE FOR ME
I KNOW SHE'S FOND ON HIM AS I KNOW TH WIND'S COMIN IN AT THE DOOR AN THAT'S ANOOF
AND YET--AND YET NOW THE SUGGESTION HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM HE REMEMBERED SO MANY THINGS VERY SLIGHT THINGS LIKE THE STIRRING OF THE WATER BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE BREEZE WHICH SEEMED TO HIM SOME CONFIRMATION OF HIS MOTHER'S WORDS
BUT APPARENTLY THERE WAS MORE INTEREST FOR HIM IN THE LIVING GROUPS CLOSE AT HAND
THERE'S PRETTY NIGH A SCORE OF EM ON THE GREEN NOW AS COME FROM THERE
LIKE ALL STRONG NATURES ADAM HAD CONFIDENCE IN HIS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE
BUT THE BEARING O THE ROOF AND WALLS WASN'T RIGHT ELSE IT WOULDN'T HA COME DOWN
BUT COME LET US HAVE OUR LUNCHEON
WHY WHAT COULD COME TRUER NOR THAT PICTUR O THE COCK WI THE BIG SPURS AS HAS GOT ITS HEAD KNOCKED DOWN WI TH ANCHOR AN TH FIRIN AN THE SHIPS BEHIND
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING SPECIAL ON ARTHUR'S MIND IN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IT WAS CLEAR HE WAS NOT INCLINED TO ENTER INTO DETAILS AND MR IRWINE WAS TOO DELICATE TO IMPLY EVEN A FRIENDLY CURIOSITY
SPEAK TO THEM LORD OPEN THEIR EARS TO MY MESSAGE BRING THEIR SINS TO THEIR MINDS AND MAKE THEM THIRST FOR THAT SALVATION WHICH THOU ART READY TO GIVE
HE ALWAYS KEPT A KEY OF THE WORKSHOP DOOR IN HIS POCKET SO THAT HE COULD LET HIMSELF IN
WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN IN THE BODY I TRUST THOUGH IT MAY BE NOT FOR A LONG WHILE
MORE AND MORE THYSELF DISPLAY SHINING TO THE PERFECT DAY
AND SO KIND TO'S MOTHER AND SISTERS
WHAT ART GOIN TO DO ASKED LISBETH
SALKELD WOULD HAVE DRUNK A BOTTLE OF PORT EVERY DAY HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF BUT I'M NOT WELL SEASONED ENOUGH FOR THAT
THERE'S MR IRWINE MAKES AS MUCH OF HER AS IF SHE WAS A LADY FOR ALL HER BEING A METHODIST AN WI THAT MAGGOT O PREACHING IN HER HEAD--GOD FORGI'E ME IF I'M I THE WRONG TO CALL IT SO AYE SAID MR POYSER LOOKING JOCOSE
I CAN'T ABIDE TO SEE MEN THROW AWAY THEIR TOOLS I THAT WAY THE MINUTE THE CLOCK BEGINS TO STRIKE AS IF THEY TOOK NO PLEASURE I THEIR WORK AND WAS AFRAID O DOING A STROKE TOO MUCH SETH LOOKED A LITTLE CONSCIOUS AND BEGAN TO BE SLOWER IN HIS PREPARATIONS FOR GOING BUT MUM TAFT BROKE SILENCE AND SAID AYE AYE ADAM LAD YE TALK LIKE A YOUNG UN
HOW SHE YEARNED TO BE BACK IN HER SAFE HOME AGAIN CHERISHED AND CARED FOR AS SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
FINE HOAKS THERE ISN'T THERE SIR
SHE IS AS ERECT IN HER COMELY EMBONPOINT AS A STATUE OF CERES
BUT THEY CAME AND TOOK ME AWAY HETTY WAS SILENT BUT SHE SHUDDERED AGAIN AS IF THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING BEHIND
WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO IS TO WORK AS WELL AS I CAN WITH THE TOOLS AND MATER'ALS I'VE GOT IN MY HANDS
WHEN FOLKS HAVE GOT AN HONOURABLE INDEPENDENT SPIRIT THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT MAKE EM SEEM BASE-MINDED BUT NO ONE WHO KNOWS YOU WILL THINK THAT ADAM
THOUGH TO BE SURE ADAM WENT ON SMILING HER NOT LIKING OTHER YOUNG WOMEN IS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULDN'T LIKE YOU HITHERTO GYP HAD BEEN ASSISTING AT THIS CONVERSATION IN MOTIONLESS SILENCE SEATED ON HIS HAUNCHES AND ALTERNATELY LOOKING UP IN HIS MASTER'S FACE TO WATCH ITS EXPRESSION AND OBSERVING DINAH'S MOVEMENTS ABOUT THE KITCHEN
BUT THE MAN SHOULD YIELD A RICHER DEEPER MUSIC
HE WAS FOND OF THINKING THAT THEY HAD A HEARTY SPECIAL REGARD FOR HIM
THEY SHOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER
I'VE PREACHED TO AS ROUGH IGNORANT PEOPLE AS CAN BE IN THE VILLAGES ABOUT SNOWFIELD--MEN THAT LOOKED VERY HARD AND WILD--BUT THEY NEVER SAID AN UNCIVIL WORD TO ME AND OFTEN THANKED ME KINDLY AS THEY MADE WAY FOR ME TO PASS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THEM THAT I CAN BELIEVE--THAT I CAN WELL BELIEVE SAID MR IRWINE EMPHATICALLY
THOUGH TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE AS HE WAS RETURNING HOME HE SAW HER AT A DISTANCE GETTING OVER A STILE QUITE OUT OF THE TREDDLESTON ROAD
SHE REACHED THE OPPOSITE GATE AND FELT HER WAY ALONG ITS RAILS AND THE RAILS OF THE SHEEP-FOLD TILL HER HAND ENCOUNTERED THE PRICKING OF THE GORSY WALL
ADAM FOR A MOMENT THOUGHT UNCOMFORTABLY ABOUT HIS FATHER
WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
EXAMINE YOUR WORDS WELL AND YOU WILL FIND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE NO MOTIVE TO BE FALSE IT IS A VERY HARD THING TO SAY THE EXACT TRUTH EVEN ABOUT YOUR OWN IMMEDIATE FEELINGS--MUCH HARDER THAN TO SAY SOMETHING FINE ABOUT THEM WHICH IS NOT THE EXACT TRUTH
FETCH HER SAID LISBETH LOOKING UP AND PAUSING FROM HER GRIEF LIKE A CRYING CHILD WHO HEARS SOME PROMISE OF CONSOLATION
ADAM WALKED MUCH FASTER AND ANY ONE COMING ALONG THE OAKBOURNE ROAD AT SUNRISE THAT MORNING MUST HAVE HAD A PLEASANT SIGHT IN THIS TALL BROAD-CHESTED MAN STRIDING ALONG WITH A CARRIAGE AS UPRIGHT AND FIRM AS ANY SOLDIER'S GLANCING WITH KEEN GLAD EYES AT THE DARK-BLUE HILLS AS THEY BEGAN TO SHOW THEMSELVES ON HIS WAY
IT IS SCARCELY AT ALL ALTERED--ONLY A LITTLE FULLER TO CORRESPOND TO HER MORE MATRONLY FIGURE WHICH STILL SEEMS LIGHT AND ACTIVE ENOUGH IN THE PLAIN BLACK DRESS
HE IS ONE OF THOSE TO WHOM HONOUR IS DUE AND HIS FRIENDS SHOULD DELIGHT TO HONOUR HIM
YOU DON'T CARE WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH FOR YOU
THERE'S NO NEED TO BE HASTY WI THE COOKING
HETTY SORREL'S WAS THAT SORT OF BEAUTY
IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WERE A RESURRECTION OF HIS DEAD JOY
I'M NOT A FOOL AND YOU'RE NOT A FOOL AND YOU KNOW BETTER THAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
WHEN HE SAT AT HIS SHOEMAKING HE'D COUNT HIS STITCHES BY FIVES AND THEN PUT A PRICE ON HIS STITCHES SAY HALF A FARTHING AND THEN SEE HOW MUCH MONEY HE COULD GET IN AN HOUR
IT WAS A BIT OF FLIRTATION--SHE KNEW MARY BURGE WAS LOOKING AT THEM
POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT
SETH BEDE WOULD HAVE COME AND SPOKEN TO YOU MY DEAR SHE SAID AS SHE REACHED HETTY BUT HE'S VERY FULL OF TROUBLE TO-NIGHT HETTY ANSWERED WITH A DIMPLED SMILE AS IF SHE DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
DINAH HAD BEEN SPEAKING AT LEAST AN HOUR AND THE REDDENING LIGHT OF THE PARTING DAY SEEMED TO GIVE A SOLEMN EMPHASIS TO HER CLOSING WORDS
AND HER PRETTINESS AND HER CONDITION AND SOMETHING RESPECTABLE ABOUT HER CLOTHES AND LOOKS AND THE TROUBLE SHE SEEMED TO BE IN MADE ME AS I COULDN'T FIND IN MY HEART TO SEND HER AWAY AT ONCE
WE WANT SUCH FELLOWS AS HE TO LICK THE FRENCH AYE SIR THAT'S ADAM BEDE THAT IS I'LL BE BOUND--THIAS BEDE'S SON EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM HEREABOUT
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN VOICES RAISED AGAINST IT IN THE SOCIETY OF LATE BUT I CANNOT BUT THINK THEIR COUNSEL WILL COME TO NOUGHT
POOR THING POOR THING SAID MARTIN THE YOUNGER WHO WAS SORRY TO HAVE PROVOKED THIS RETROSPECTIVE HARSHNESS
HE HAS TAKEN A ROOM THERE AND I ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO BECAUSE I THINK IT BETTER HE SHOULD BE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME AT PRESENT
BUT AS IT WAS HE MERELY OBSERVED THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED AT THAT MOMENT
I WANT YOU NOW TO GO WITH ME TO STONITON
I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT FROM THE REMEMBRANCE OF DINAH'S CONFESSION THAT SUNDAY AFTERNOON
HE BEGAN EVEN TO PITY HIMSELF FOR THE NECESSITY HE WAS UNDER OF DECEIVING ADAM--IT WAS A COURSE SO OPPOSED TO THE HONESTY OF HIS OWN NATURE
BUT IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS PARTICULARLY PROUD THIS MORNING AS IS THE WONT OF BRIDEGROOMS FOR HIS HAPPINESS WAS OF A KIND THAT HAD LITTLE REFERENCE TO MEN'S OPINION OF IT
YOU'LL WANT A PORTLY RECTOR TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE AND TAKE HIS TITHE OF ALL THE RESPECT AND HONOUR YOU GET BY YOUR HARD WORK
MY EYE SHE'S GOT HER BONNET OFF
IT WAS HARD WORK FOR HIM TO LEAVE HER--HARD TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD NOT KNOW FOR DAYS HOW SHE WAS BEARING HER TROUBLE
NOT MORE THAN FOUR HOURS HOWEVER FOR BEFORE FIVE O'CLOCK HE SET OUT ON HIS WAY HOME IN THE FAINT MORNING TWILIGHT
I THINK SHE SETS THE JUG UNDER AND FORGETS TO TURN THE TAP AS THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T BELIEVE O THEM WENCHES
FOR THERE WAS A NEW ROOM IN THE COTTAGE YOU REMEMBER BUILT NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO IN THE EXPECTATION OF A NEW INMATE
THERE WAS MORE SEARCHING FOR THE MEANS OF LIGHTING THE CANDLE AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE WENT CAUTIOUSLY ROUND THE ROOM AS IF WISHING TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SOMETHING
WOULD IT BE ANY USE MY BEING A FIRST-RATE GARDENER IF I'D GOT NOUGHT BUT A QUAGMIRE TO WORK ON NO SAYS HE
JIM SALT A BURLY RED-HAIRED MAN KNOWN AS SANDY JIM PAUSED FROM HIS PLANING AND ADAM SAID TO SETH WITH A SHARP GLANCE OF SURPRISE WHAT
MRS POYSER DESIRED HIM EMPHATICALLY NOT TO COME BACK WITHOUT HETTY FOR SHE HAD BEEN QUITE TOO LONG AWAY CONSIDERING THE THINGS SHE HAD TO GET READY BY THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AND A WEEK WAS SURELY ENOUGH FOR ANY ONE TO GO OUT FOR THEIR HEALTH
IT UD MAKE A POOR BALANCE WHEN MY DOINGS ARE CAST UP AT THE LAST IF MY POOR OLD MOTHER STOOD O THE WRONG SIDE
STILL MORE TO-DAY
BUT IF IN THE REACTION OF DISGUST I HAVE BETAKEN MYSELF TO A FISHY EYE THERE HAS BEEN A SURPRISING SIMILARITY OF RESULT
I TAKE SOME INTEREST IN THIS HETTY SORREL FOR THE SAKE OF THAT FINE FELLOW ADAM BEDE
AN THAT'S HOW IT IS THERE'S OLD BACHELORS COME CRAIG SAID MR POYSER JOCOSELY YOU MUN GET MARRIED PRETTY QUICK ELSE YOU'LL BE SET DOWN FOR AN OLD BACHELOR
SHE ONLY THOUGHT OF THAT AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE IF SHE HAD NOT COURAGE FOR DEATH
I HAVE SEEN THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN I HAVE BEEN SITTING IN STILLNESS AND DARKNESS AND A GREAT TERROR HAS COME UPON ME LEST I SHOULD BECOME HARD AND A LOVER OF SELF AND NO MORE BEAR WILLINGLY THE REDEEMER'S CROSS DINAH HAD CLOSED HER EYES AND A FAINT SHUDDER WENT THROUGH HER
IT'S A PITY THEY CANNA HA'T ALL AN TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM AS DONNA LIKE IT
HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE VENTURED TO DENY THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO IN BRINGING ABOUT THE REGULAR RETURN OF DAYLIGHT AND THE CHANGES IN THE WEATHER
AND THERE CAN BE NOTHING TO LOOK AT PLEASANTER NOR A FINE MILCH COW STANDING UP TO'TS KNEES IN PASTURE AND THE NEW MILK FROTHING IN THE PAIL AND THE FRESH BUTTER READY FOR MARKET AND THE CALVES AND THE POULTRY
WHO'S GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAIN IT AND YE'LL SING US OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY AFTER DINNER WONNA YE SAID MR CHOWNE
IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME THIN GOLD RINGS IN THEM WHICH WERE ALSO WORTH A LITTLE MONEY
BUT NOW THE ROAST BEEF WAS FINISHED AND THE CLOTH WAS DRAWN LEAVING A FAIR LARGE DEAL TABLE FOR THE BRIGHT DRINKING-CANS AND THE FOAMING BROWN JUGS AND THE BRIGHT BRASS CANDLESTICKS PLEASANT TO BEHOLD
HE HAD FELT ILL ON HIS JOURNEY HOME--HE TOLD HER WHEN SHE CAME DOWN--HAD STAYED ALL NIGHT AT TREDDDLESTON FOR THAT REASON
HER HEAD GUARDED BY HER BONNET FOUND A PILLOW AGAINST THE GORSY WALL AND THE POOR SOUL DRIVEN TO AND FRO BETWEEN TWO EQUAL TERRORS FOUND THE ONE RELIEF THAT WAS POSSIBLE TO IT--THE RELIEF OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS
HIS FACE IS NOTHING BUT A PALE BLURRED SPOT TO ME
AN TO THINK AS HE MIGHT HA MARY BURGE AN BE TOOK PARTNERS AN BE A BIG MAN WI WORKMEN UNDER HIM LIKE MESTER BURGE--DOLLY'S TOLD ME SO O'ER AND O'ER AGAIN--IF IT WARNA AS HE'S SET'S HEART ON THAT BIT OF A WENCH AS IS O NO MORE USE NOR THE GILLYFLOWER ON THE WALL
HE HAD BEEN FOOLISHLY SANGUINE AND CONFIDENT
I WARRANT THE OLD WOMAN WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU SINCE YOU STAYED SO LONG SHE SEEMED TO LIKE HAVING ME THERE AT LAST
HIS EYEBROWS HAVE LESS PROMINENCE AND MORE REPOSE THAN HIS BROTHER'S
IF I'D GONE MYSELF I COULD HA FOUND OUT BY ASKING THE MEMBERS O THE SOCIETY
ADAM'S JUDGMENT OF HIM ADAM'S GRATING WORDS DISTURBED HIS SELF-SOOTHING ARGUMENTS
IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT DINAH'S IMAGINATION AND SYMPATHY ACTED AND REACTED HABITUALLY EACH HEIGHTENING THE OTHER
TELL HER ARTHUR WENT ON HURRIEDLY AS IF HE WANTED TO HIDE THE EMOTION WITH WHICH HE SPOKE WHILE HE TOOK OFF HIS CHAIN AND WATCH TELL HER I ASKED YOU TO GIVE HER THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME--OF THE MAN TO WHOM SHE IS THE ONE SOURCE OF COMFORT WHEN HE THINKS OF...I KNOW SHE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SUCH THINGS--OR ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GIVE HER FOR ITS OWN SAKE
HE DID NOT LIKE TO PART WI TH LAD
SHE COULD NEVER ENDURE THAT SHAME BEFORE HER UNCLE AND AUNT BEFORE MARY BURGE AND THE SERVANTS AT THE CHASE AND THE PEOPLE AT BROXTON AND EVERYBODY WHO KNEW HER
AND HE HAD NO IDEAL WORLD OF DEAD HEROES
WHAT DEEP AND WORTHY LOVE IS SO WHETHER OF WOMAN OR CHILD OR ART OR MUSIC
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MOVED BY THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE--VERY NATURALLY FOR HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE WORLD AND IT WAS UNITING TO DO HIM HONOUR
AND MARY BURGE AND EVERYBODY WOULD PERHAPS SEE HER GOING OUT IN HER CARRIAGE--OR RATHER THEY WOULD HEAR OF IT
YET IT LOOKED VERY CHEERY THIS MORNING AS ARTHUR REACHED THE OPEN WINDOW
I THINK I SHALL HAVE A LOFTY THRONE FOR YOU GODMAMMA OR RATHER TWO ONE ON THE LAWN AND ANOTHER IN THE BALLROOM THAT YOU MAY SIT AND LOOK DOWN UPON US LIKE AN OLYMPIAN GODDESS I MEAN TO BRING OUT MY BEST BROCADE THAT I WORE AT YOUR CHRISTENING TWENTY YEARS AGO SAID MRS IRWINE
SHE LEFT ONE BEHIND SO I CAN TAKE THE PATTERN NAY NAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO WEAR A METHODIST CAP LIKE DINAH'S
I'M NOT A TIPPLIN MAN NOR A DRUNKARD--NOBODY CAN SAY IT ON ME--BUT I LIKE A EXTRY QUART AT EASTER OR CHRISTMAS TIME AS IS NAT'RAL WHEN WE'RE GOIN THE ROUNDS A-SINGIN AN FOLKS OFFER'T YOU FOR NOTHIN
THE AUTUMNAL SUNDAY SUNSHINE SOOTHED HIM BUT NOT BY PREPARING HIM WITH RESIGNATION TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT IF HIS MOTHER--IF HE HIMSELF--PROVED TO BE MISTAKEN ABOUT DINAH
OH I DON'T MIND SAID HETTY HASTILY SO AS I CAN GET MONEY TO GO BACK AND THEY MIGHT THINK THE THINGS WERE STOLEN AS YOU WANTED TO SELL EM HE WENT ON FOR IT ISN'T USUAL FOR A YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU TO HAVE FINE JEW'LLERY LIKE THAT THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HETTY'S FACE WITH ANGER
LET ME GO ADAM MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND OPENED IT BUT WHEN ARTHUR REACHED THE STEP HE STOPPED AGAIN AND LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR-POST
BUT AFTER FEELING HAD WELLED UP AND POURED ITSELF OUT IN THIS WAY BUSY THOUGHT WOULD COME BACK WITH THE GREATER VIGOUR
AND NO HARM WOULD COME--NO HARM SHOULD COME FOR THE NEXT TIME HE WAS ALONE WITH HETTY HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER THAT SHE MUST NOT THINK SERIOUSLY OF HIM OR OF WHAT HAD PASSED
HE THRUST IT INTO HIS POCKET AS THE HORSE WAS LED UP TO HIM AND AT THAT MOMENT CAUGHT SIGHT OF MILLS ANXIOUS FACE IN FRONT OF HIM
HEAR WHAT HE SAYS
I THROW BACK YOUR FAVOURS FOR YOU'RE NOT THE MAN I TOOK YOU FOR
THEY LET ONE SEE WHAT IS GOING ON
BUT I DARESAY IF YOUR OLD FRIEND MR IRWINE WERE TO COME TO LIFE AGAIN AND GET INTO THE PULPIT NEXT SUNDAY YOU WOULD BE RATHER ASHAMED THAT HE DIDN'T PREACH BETTER AFTER ALL YOUR PRAISE OF HIM NAY NAY SAID ADAM BROADENING HIS CHEST AND THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR AS IF HE WERE READY TO MEET ALL INFERENCES NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD ME SAY MR IRWINE WAS MUCH OF A PREACHER
AND I SHOULD REQUEST YOU MRS POYSER TO SUPPLY MY HOUSE WITH MILK CREAM AND BUTTER AT THE MARKET PRICES
HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE POWER OF LOVING WAS ALL THE WHILE GAINING NEW FORCE WITHIN HIM
I SHOULD THINK HIS COUNTENANCE IS PLEASANT INDEED
THE SOFT VOICE THE PITYING EYES WOULD HAVE DRAWN HER
HIS WATCH LAY BEFORE HIM ON THE TABLE AS IF HE WERE COUNTING THE LONG MINUTES
I KNOW WHO Y ARE NOW
HE SAID I NEEDN'T QUITE GIVE IT UP THAT'S A BLESSED THOUGHT TO ME SAID DINAH HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
THE LAMPS WERE ALREADY LIT THOUGH THE SUN HAD NOT LONG SET AND THERE WAS THAT CALM LIGHT OUT OF DOORS IN WHICH WE SEEM TO SEE ALL OBJECTS MORE DISTINCTLY THAN IN THE BROAD DAY
IT WAS MORE THAN HALF-PAST EIGHT WHEN ADAM AND HIS MOTHER WERE TALKING IN THIS WAY SO THAT WHEN ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER HETTY REACHED THE TURNING OF THE LANE THAT LED TO THE FARMYARD GATE SHE SAW DINAH AND SETH APPROACHING IT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND WAITED FOR THEM TO COME UP TO HER
THEY WOULD KNOW SHE WAS CRYING BECAUSE ARTHUR WAS NOT THERE
PERHAPS HETTY HAD HAD AS MUCH AS THAT IN CHRISTMAS BOXES AND THERE WAS NO KNOWING BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CHILDISH ENOUGH TO SPEND IT IN THAT WAY
HE WAS AMAZED AT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS NEW THOUGHT OF DINAH'S LOVE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIM WITH AN OVERMASTERING POWER THAT MADE ALL OTHER FEELINGS GIVE WAY BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS DESIRE TO KNOW THAT THE THOUGHT WAS TRUE
IT IS MORE THAN A WOMAN'S LOVE THAT MOVES US IN A WOMAN'S EYES--IT SEEMS TO BE A FAR-OFF MIGHTY LOVE THAT HAS COME NEAR TO US AND MADE SPEECH FOR ITSELF THERE
I MEAN YOU ARE NEVER SHILLY-SHALLY FIRST MAKING UP YOUR MIND THAT YOU WON'T DO A THING AND THEN DOING IT AFTER ALL WELL SAID ADAM SLOWLY AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION NO
AN IMAGE OF A GREAT AGONY--THE AGONY OF THE CROSS
AND DO YOU KNOW MRS POYSER IF I WERE GOING TO MARRY AND SETTLE I SHOULD BE TEMPTED TO TURN YOU OUT AND DO UP THIS FINE OLD HOUSE AND TURN FARMER MYSELF OH SIR SAID MRS POYSER RATHER ALARMED YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL
NO EYELASHES COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN HETTY'S
THERE'S THE MOST CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IN MY GRANDFATHER
IT'LL BE A HARD JOB FOR ME TO TELL HER AUNT
I SHOULD HA BEEN SURE OF HER THEN AS SHE WOULDN'T GO AWAY FROM ME TO SNOWFIELD WELLY THIRTY MILE OFF AND ME NOT GOT A CREATUR TO LOOK TO ONLY NEIGHBOURS AS ARE NO KIN TO ME AN MOST OF EM WOMEN AS I'D BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE IF MY DAIRY THINGS WAR LIKE THEIR'N
BUT TOWARDS THE CLOSE THE RAPS BECAME SO SHARP AND FREQUENT AND HIS VOICE SO QUARRELSOME THAT VIXEN FELT IT INCUMBENT ON HER TO JUMP OUT OF THE HAMPER AND BARK VAGUELY
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T TURN INTO A SUM FOR THERE'S NOTHING BUT WHAT'S GOT NUMBER IN IT--EVEN A FOOL
HOWEVER IT WAS SHE STARED AND STARTED LIKE A GHOST-SEER AND THE PRECIOUS BROWN-AND-WHITE JUG FELL TO THE GROUND PARTING FOR EVER WITH ITS SPOUT AND HANDLE
IT HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TARNISHED GILDING ABOUT IT
I MEAN TO GO TO EAGLEDALE AND FISH FOR A WEEK OR SO HE SAID ALOUD
THAT SECOND TABLE IS FOR THE FARMERS WIVES AND CHILDREN
ONLY CAUSE HIM TO SUFFER MORE FROM THE SIGHT OF HER DISTRESS AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF IT
SO THE ANXIOUS HEART-STRICKEN ADAM MUST OF NECESSITY WAIT AND TRY TO REST TILL MORNING--NAY TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE COACH STARTED
LET ME TAKE YOU INTO THAT DINING-ROOM AND SHOW YOU THE REV
SHE MUST RUN AWAY
YOU WOULD KNOW THEN THAT IT'S WORSE FOR ME THAN FOR YOU ARTHUR ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITH THE LAST WORDS AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS LOOKING OUT AND TURNING HIS BACK ON ADAM AS HE CONTINUED PASSIONATELY HAVEN'T I LOVED HER TOO
FIRST MARTIN POYSER LOOKING AS CHEERY AS A BRIGHT FIRE ON THIS RIMY MORNING LED QUIET MARY BURGE THE BRIDESMAID
DOUBTLESS THERE WAS A LARGE SWEEP OF PARK AND A BROAD GLASSY POOL IN FRONT OF THAT MANSION BUT THE SWELLING SLOPE OF MEADOW WOULD NOT LET OUR TRAVELLER SEE THEM FROM THE VILLAGE GREEN
I COULD NEVER MAKE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT BY A BRIGHT SPRING DAY
SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN ILL AND DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN THEM BY LETTING THEM KNOW
ISN'T THE COFFIN PROMISED
MAKE MOTHER GO TO BED AND GO THYSELF MEANTIME LISBETH HAD DRIED HER EYES AND NOW FOLLOWED SETH HOLDING SOMETHING IN HER HANDS
HETTY LOOKED AT HER MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS ONE MIGHT IMAGINE A LITTLE PERCHING BIRD THAT COULD ONLY FLUTTER FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH TO LOOK AT THE SWOOP OF THE SWALLOW OR THE MOUNTING OF THE LARK
BUT WHENEVER I TRIED TO FIX MY MIND ON MARRIAGE AND OUR LIVING TOGETHER OTHER THOUGHTS ALWAYS CAME IN--THE TIMES WHEN I'VE PRAYED BY THE SICK AND DYING AND THE HAPPY HOURS I'VE HAD PREACHING WHEN MY HEART WAS FILLED WITH LOVE AND THE WORD WAS GIVEN TO ME ABUNDANTLY
I CAN'T THINK WHAT THAT STRANGE PERSON'S COME ABOUT THE BUTLER ADDED FROM MERE INCONTINENCE OF REMARK AS HE PRECEDED ADAM TO THE DOOR HE'S GONE I THE DINING-ROOM
I BEGIN TO HATE THE SIGHT O THE COW
IT WAS ARTHUR'S PRESENT BOUGHT WITH HIS POCKET-MONEY WHEN HE WAS A FAIR-HAIRED LAD OF ELEVEN AND WHEN HE HAD PROFITED SO WELL BY ADAM'S LESSONS IN CARPENTERING AND TURNING AS TO EMBARRASS EVERY FEMALE IN THE HOUSE WITH GIFTS OF SUPERFLUOUS THREAD-REELS AND ROUND BOXES
IT IS TRUE THAT NOW AND THEN WHEN HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE HEATED BY AN EXTRA GLASS OF GROG HE HAD BEEN HEARD TO SAY OF HETTY THAT THE LASS WAS WELL ENOUGH AND THAT A MAN MIGHT DO WORSE
WE MUST GO AND PLASH UP THE MUD A LITTLE MUS'N'T WE JUNO THIS WAS ADDRESSED TO THE BROWN SETTER WHO HAD JUMPED UP AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICES AND LAID HER NOSE IN AN INSINUATING WAY ON HER MASTER'S LEG
I COULDN'T WISH OR TRY FOR ANYTHING
SHE KNEW THEE NOT
LISBETH HAD CRIED SO PITEOUSLY AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING ADAM THAT HE HAD GONE TO HETTY AND ASKED HER IF FOR THE LOVE OF HIM SHE WOULD PUT UP WITH HIS MOTHER'S WAYS AND CONSENT TO LIVE WITH HER
WELL ADAM I'M GLAD TO SEE YE SAID MR POYSER
ANOTHER DAY HAD RISEN AND SHE MUST WANDER ON
HE SAW HOW IT WOULD BE TO-MORROW MORNING WHEN HE HAD CARRIED THE COFFIN TO BROXTON AND WAS AT HOME AGAIN HAVING HIS BREAKFAST
SHE SAID IT WAS DEAD AND I'D BETTER TAKE IT TO THE PARISH AND TELL THE CONSTABLE
SEE WHERE OUR BLESSED LORD STANDS AND WEEPS AND STRETCHES OUT HIS ARMS TOWARDS YOU
IT'S A STRANGE THING--SOMETIMES WHEN I'M QUITE ALONE SITTING IN MY ROOM WITH MY EYES CLOSED OR WALKING OVER THE HILLS THE PEOPLE I'VE SEEN AND KNOWN IF IT'S ONLY BEEN FOR A FEW DAYS ARE BROUGHT BEFORE ME AND I HEAR THEIR VOICES AND SEE THEM LOOK AND MOVE ALMOST PLAINER THAN I EVER DID WHEN THEY WERE REALLY WITH ME SO AS I COULD TOUCH THEM
WILL THEY HANG ME FOR CERTAIN?...I WOULDN'T MIND IF THEY'D LET ME LIVE MY POOR HETTY DEATH IS VERY DREADFUL TO YOU
SHE THOUGHT SUFFERING AND FEAR MIGHT HAVE DRIVEN THE POOR SINNER OUT OF HER MIND
AND WELL YOU MAY FOR I REMEMBER POOR THIAS AS FINE A BROAD-SHOULDERED FELLOW AS NEED TO BE
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANS TO DO WHY YES SAID ADAM
RATHER A LOOSE FISH I THINK
THE MASTER WHO EMPLOYED THEM SAYS WHERE SHALL I FIND THEIR LIKE CHAPTER XX ADAM VISITS THE HALL FARM ADAM CAME BACK FROM HIS WORK IN THE EMPTY WAGGON--THAT WAS WHY HE HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES--AND WAS READY TO SET OUT TO THE HALL FARM WHEN IT STILL WANTED A QUARTER TO SEVEN
BEING ON THE SECOND STORY OF THAT TALL HOUSE IT GAVE HER A WIDE VIEW OVER THE FIELDS
I WILL NOT SAY THAT HIS LOVE FOR THAT GOOD FELLOW DID NOT OWE SOME OF ITS FORCE TO THE LOVE OF PATRONAGE
SHE SAYS THIS COUNTRY'S TOO COMFORTABLE AN THERE'S TOO MUCH T EAT AN FOLKS ARENA MISERABLE ENOUGH
I CAN SEE THAT CLEAR ENOUGH
YOU SUSPECT AT ONCE THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THIS ROOM HAVE INHERITED MORE BLOOD THAN WEALTH AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT MR IRWINE HAD A FINELY CUT NOSTRIL AND UPPER LIP
IT'S RIGHT O'ER MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S FALLOW AND A FOUL FALLOW IT IS WELL YOU MARK MY WORDS AS THAT CLOUD ULL SPREAD O'ER THE SKY PRETTY NIGH AS QUICK AS YOU'D SPREAD A TARPAULIN OVER ONE O YOUR HAY-RICKS
I NEVER GET HOLD OF YOU NOW EH
I WON'T HINDER YOU ANY LONGER
THEN OF COURSE I MIGHT REFASHION LIFE AND CHARACTER ENTIRELY AFTER MY OWN LIKING
IN BOTH OF THEM THE CONCENTRATION IN THE PRESENT WHICH HAD ATTENDED THE FIRST MOMENTS OF ARTHUR'S REVIVAL HAD NOW GIVEN WAY TO A VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PREVIOUS SCENE
MY MOTHER HAD EYES AS BLACK AS SLOES JUST LIKE HETTY'S THE CHILD ULL BE NONE THE WORSE FOR HAVING SUMMAT AS ISN'T LIKE HETTY
BUT THERE IS ONE ORDER OF BEAUTY WHICH SEEMS MADE TO TURN THE HEADS NOT ONLY OF MEN BUT OF ALL INTELLIGENT MAMMALS EVEN OF WOMEN
WHILE HETTY WAS IN THE ACT OF PLACING HER IN ADAM'S ARMS AND HAD NOT YET WITHDRAWN HER OWN TOTTY OPENED HER EYES AND FORTHWITH FOUGHT OUT WITH HER LEFT FIST AT ADAM'S ARM AND WITH HER RIGHT CAUGHT AT THE STRING OF BROWN BEADS ROUND HETTY'S NECK
YE'RE NOT LIKE THE LASSES O THIS COUNTRYSIDE
I'VE NOT SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO MAKE YOU THINK ILL OF ME THE QUESTION SURPRISED HER AND RELIEVED HER BY GIVING A NEW COURSE TO HER FEELING
IT'S A PITY SEEING THEY'RE SO FOND OF YOU YOU KNOW ADAM MY HEART IS AS THEIR HEART SO FAR AS LOVE FOR THEM AND CARE FOR THEIR WELFARE GOES BUT THEY ARE IN NO PRESENT NEED
MUST WE TELL HER NO NOT YET SAID ADAM RISING FROM THE BENCH AND PUSHING THE HAIR FROM HIS FACE AS IF HE WANTED TO ROUSE HIMSELF
YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR
OR THE PUG WHO IS DOZING WITH HIS BLACK MUZZLE ALOFT LIKE A SLEEPY PRESIDENT
IT'S A POOR TALE YOU COULDN'T COME TO SEE THE PUDDING WHEN IT WAS WHOLE ADAM LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ROUND FOR A FOURTH WOMAN'S FIGURE BUT DINAH WAS NOT THERE
I'LL NE'ER LIFT MY HAT TO HIM AGAIN NOR SIT I THE SAME CHURCH WI HIM...A MAN AS HAS BROUGHT SHAME ON RESPECTABLE FOLKS...AN PRETENDED TO BE SUCH A FRIEND T EVERYBODY....POOR ADAM THERE...A FINE FRIEND HE'S BEEN T ADAM MAKING SPEECHES AN TALKING SO FINE AN ALL THE WHILE POISONING THE LAD'S LIFE AS IT'S MUCH IF HE CAN STAY I THIS COUNTRY ANY MORE NOR WE CAN AN YOU T HA TO GO INTO COURT AND OWN YOU'RE AKIN T HER SAID THE OLD MAN
HE FELT THAT THE LAST PREPARATIONS WERE BEGINNING AND HE COULD STAY NO LONGER
THE BIRDS SEEM TO FEEL JUST THE SAME
I'M NOT FOR MAKING A SIN OF EVERY LITTLE FOOL'S TRICK OR BIT O NONSENSE ANYBODY MAY BE LET INTO LIKE SOME O THEM DISSENTERS
ARTHUR MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK ROOMS WITH THE GRAND COMPANY WHERE HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY KNOW THAT SHE WAS COME AND SHE SHOULD NOT SEE HIM FOR A LONG LONG WHILE--NOT TILL AFTER DINNER WHEN THEY SAID HE WAS TO COME UP AND MAKE A SPEECH
I CAN'T BE PUT OFF WITH AMIABILITY WHICH IS ALWAYS THE EXCUSE PEOPLE ARE MAKING FOR THE EXISTENCE OF PLAIN PEOPLE
HOW IS IT WE'VE GOT SIGHT O YOU SO LONG BEFORE FODDERING-TIME I CAME ON AN ERRAND FOR MOTHER SAID ADAM
SETH HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE SPOKEN A HARSH WORD TO HIS MOTHER AND TIMID PEOPLE ALWAYS WREAK THEIR PEEVISHNESS ON THE GENTLE
AT LAST AFTER TASTING THE PORRIDGE SHE BROKE SILENCE
AND AS HE SAW THE SIGNS OF RETURNING EASE IN ARTHUR THE WORDS AGAIN AND AGAIN CAME TO HIS LIPS AND WENT BACK CHECKED BY THE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LEAVE EVERYTHING TILL TO-MORROW
SHE SHOULD ALWAYS BE DOING THINGS SHE HAD NO PLEASURE IN GETTING UP TO THE OLD TASKS OF WORK SEEING PEOPLE SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT GOING TO CHURCH AND TO TREDDLESTON AND TO TEA WITH MRS BEST AND CARRYING NO HAPPY THOUGHT WITH HER
THE CONCERT OF THE TOOLS AND ADAM'S VOICE WAS AT LAST BROKEN BY SETH WHO LIFTING THE DOOR AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN WORKING INTENTLY PLACED IT AGAINST THE WALL AND SAID THERE
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A COMPANION THAT SHE MIGHT COMPLAIN TO--THAT WOULD PITY HER
BUT I MUST PUT UP WITH IT WHICHEVER WAY IT IS--I'VE ONLY TO BE THANKFUL IT'S BEEN NO WORSE
THE SHATTERING OF ALL HER LITTLE DREAM-WORLD THE CRUSHING BLOW ON HER NEW-BORN PASSION AFFLICTED HER PLEASURE-CRAVING NATURE WITH AN OVERPOWERING PAIN THAT ANNIHILATED ALL IMPULSE TO RESISTANCE AND SUSPENDED HER ANGER
AND SO HE SAUNTERED FORWARD WITH ELABORATE CARELESSNESS--HIS FLUSHED FACE HIS EVENING DRESS OF FINE CLOTH AND FINE LINEN HIS HANDS HALF-THRUST INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS ALL SHONE UPON BY THE STRANGE EVENING LIGHT WHICH THE LIGHT CLOUDS HAD CAUGHT UP EVEN TO THE ZENITH AND WERE NOW SHEDDING DOWN BETWEEN THE TOPMOST BRANCHES ABOVE HIM
BUT I MUST GET MY SUPPER FIRST FOR I'M HUNGRY I'M HUNGRY
IT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A HANDSOME GLASS IN ITS DAY AND HAD PROBABLY BEEN BOUGHT INTO THE POYSER FAMILY A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BEFORE AT A SALE OF GENTEEL HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE
SO WE'LL SET OFF FOR THE SOONER I'M AT HOME THE BETTER MOTHER SAID TOTTY WITH HER TREBLE PIPE DINAH WAS SAYING HER PRAYERS AND CRYING EVER SO HUSH HUSH SAID THE MOTHER LITTLE GELLS MUSTN'T CHATTER WHEREUPON THE FATHER SHAKING WITH SILENT LAUGHTER SET TOTTY ON THE WHITE DEAL TABLE AND DESIRED HER TO KISS HIM
WHEN ADAM OPENED THE DOOR TO LOOK OUT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE ONLY MOTION SEEMED TO BE IN THE GLOWING TWINKLING STARS
HOWIVER IF THEE WOULDSTNA BE EASY ALICK CAN STAY AT HOME I THE FOREPART O THE DAY AND TIM CAN COME BACK TOW'RDS FIVE O'CLOCK AND LET ALICK HAVE HIS TURN
THAT RICH UNDULATING DISTRICT OF LOAMSHIRE TO WHICH HAYSLOPE BELONGED LIES CLOSE TO A GRIM OUTSKIRT OF STONYSHIRE OVERLOOKED BY ITS BARREN HILLS AS A PRETTY BLOOMING SISTER MAY SOMETIMES BE SEEN LINKED IN THE ARM OF A RUGGED TALL SWARTHY BROTHER
I'LL OVERTAKE YOU IN THREE MINUTES
TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN--SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY--HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
BUT BETWEEN UNARMED MEN THE BATTLE IS TO THE STRONG WHERE THE STRONG IS NO BLUNDERER AND ARTHUR MUST SINK UNDER A WELL-PLANTED BLOW OF ADAM'S AS A STEEL ROD IS BROKEN BY AN IRON BAR
CHAPTER VI THE HALL FARM EVIDENTLY THAT GATE IS NEVER OPENED FOR THE LONG GRASS AND THE GREAT HEMLOCKS GROW CLOSE AGAINST IT AND IF IT WERE OPENED IT IS SO RUSTY THAT THE FORCE NECESSARY TO TURN IT ON ITS HINGES WOULD BE LIKELY TO PULL DOWN THE SQUARE STONE-BUILT PILLARS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE TWO STONE LIONESSES WHICH GRIN WITH A DOUBTFUL CARNIVOROUS AFFABILITY ABOVE A COAT OF ARMS SURMOUNTING EACH OF THE PILLARS
I SAW NOTHING BUT THAT PLACE IN THE WOOD WHERE I'D BURIED THE BABY...I SEE IT NOW
EVERY GENERATION IN THE VILLAGE WAS THERE FROM OLD FEYTHER TAFT IN HIS BROWN WORSTED NIGHT-CAP WHO WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BUT SEEMED TOUGH ENOUGH TO KEEP ON HIS LEGS A LONG WHILE LEANING ON HIS SHORT STICK DOWN TO THE BABIES WITH THEIR LITTLE ROUND HEADS LOLLING FORWARD IN QUILTED LINEN CAPS
THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT IN IT FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT
I COULD HA WISHED MYSELF AS ADAM COULD HA MADE ANOTHER CHOICE BUT I WOULDN'T REPROACH HIM FOR WHAT HE CAN'T HELP
THERE'S A PIECE O SHEETING I COULD GIVE YOU AS THAT SQUINTING KITTY SPUN--SHE WAS A RARE GIRL TO SPIN FOR ALL SHE SQUINTED AND THE CHILDREN COULDN'T ABIDE HER
IT IS THESE MORE OR LESS UGLY STUPID INCONSISTENT PEOPLE WHOSE MOVEMENTS OF GOODNESS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADMIRE--FOR WHOM YOU SHOULD CHERISH ALL POSSIBLE HOPES ALL POSSIBLE PATIENCE
HE WAS DISTURBED BY THE SOUND OF APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS BUT THE BEECH STOOD AT A TURNING IN THE ROAD AND HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS COMING UNTIL THE TALL SLIM FIGURE IN DEEP MOURNING SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AT ONLY TWO YARDS DISTANCE
THEY KNOW ALL OUR PENITENCE ALL OUR ACHING SENSE THAT THEIR PLACE IS EMPTY ALL THE KISSES WE BESTOW ON THE SMALLEST RELIC OF THEIR PRESENCE
MARRY HER QUITE SECRETLY AS MR JAMES THE DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT MARRIED THE DOCTOR'S NIECE AND NOBODY EVER FOUND IT OUT FOR A LONG WHILE AFTER AND THEN IT WAS OF NO USE TO BE ANGRY
THERE'S NO REAL MAKING AMENDS IN THIS WORLD ANY MORE NOR YOU CAN MEND A WRONG SUBTRACTION BY DOING YOUR ADDITION RIGHT THIS WAS THE KEY-NOTE TO WHICH ADAM'S THOUGHTS HAD PERPETUALLY RETURNED SINCE HIS FATHER'S DEATH AND THE SOLEMN WAIL OF THE FUNERAL PSALM WAS ONLY AN INFLUENCE THAT BROUGHT BACK THE OLD THOUGHTS WITH STRONGER EMPHASIS
EVEN TO GET TO ASHBY SEEMED A HARD THING
I'M UP I THE GARRET A'READY AND HAVEN'T SO MUCH AS DUG THE FOUNDATION WHENEVER ADAM WAS STRONGLY CONVINCED OF ANY PROPOSITION IT TOOK THE FORM OF A PRINCIPLE IN HIS MIND
YOU'D BE THINKING HE MIGHT DO WELL ENOUGH ON A HALF-EMPTY STOMACH EH I WONDER WHERE SHE IS THIS BLESSED SUNDAY
STILL LESS HAD HE REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS ROUND JOLLY FACE WHICH WAS GOOD HUMOUR ITSELF AS HE SAID COME HETTY--COME LITTLE UNS AND GIVING HIS ARM TO HIS WIFE LED THE WAY THROUGH THE CAUSEWAY GATE INTO THE YARD
OUR CARESSES OUR TENDER WORDS OUR STILL RAPTURE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AUTUMN SUNSETS OR PILLARED VISTAS OR CALM MAJESTIC STATUES OR BEETHOVEN SYMPHONIES ALL BRING WITH THEM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THEY ARE MERE WAVES AND RIPPLES IN AN UNFATHOMABLE OCEAN OF LOVE AND BEAUTY
BUT I COUNSEL YOU TO WAIT PATIENTLY AND NOT LIGHTLY TO LEAVE YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND KINDRED
AH WOULDN'T YOU LOVE SUCH A MAN IF YOU SAW HIM--IF HE WERE HERE IN THIS VILLAGE
WELL MEG MY PRETTY GIRL SAID ARTHUR PATTING HER NECK WE'LL HAVE A GLORIOUS CANTER THIS MORNING NAY YOUR HONOUR I DONNA SEE AS THAT CAN BE SAID JOHN
HIS HEART WAS BEATING VIOLENTLY
AH SHE WOULD SAY IT'S ALL VERY FINE HAVING A READY-MADE RICH MAN BUT MAYHAPPEN HE'LL BE A READY-MADE FOOL
AH HE THOUGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN SHE'S ONLY SEVENTEEN
I'LL SAY NO MORE
YE MAY LIKE WORK BETTER NOR PLAY BUT I LIKE PLAY BETTER NOR WORK
HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH
I THINK MY FAULT LIES TH OTHER WAY
YES--WITH HER BONNET HANGING DOWN HER BACK AND HER FAT FACE DREADFULLY SMEARED WITH RED JUICE TURNED UP TOWARDS THE CHERRY-TREE WHILE SHE HELD HER LITTLE ROUND HOLE OF A MOUTH AND HER RED-STAINED PINAFORE TO RECEIVE THE PROMISED DOWNFALL
THERE ARE NO LEAVES ON THE TREES AND HEDGEROWS BUT HOW GREEN ALL THE GRASSY FIELDS ARE
BUT ADAM'S LIPS REMAINED FIRMLY CLOSED AND THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE UNCHANGED
COME DON'T CRY
STILL WHEN HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND AGAIN AS SHE MOVED ABOUT OR SAT AT HER WORK THERE WAS A CHANGE
AND SINCE I CANNOT MARRY YOU WE MUST PART--WE MUST TRY NOT TO FEEL LIKE LOVERS ANY MORE
THE MISSIS HAS HARDLY GOT OVER IT
IT SEEMED AS IF HER LAST FAINT STRENGTH AND HOPE LAY IN THAT CONTACT AND THE PITYING LOVE THAT SHONE OUT FROM DINAH'S FACE LOOKED LIKE A VISIBLE PLEDGE OF THE INVISIBLE MERCY
THEE SNAPP'ST ME UP IF IVER I FIND FAUT WI TH LAD
AND THOUGH MRS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR WHICH SHE WAS QUITE DETERMINED TO MAKE TO HIM THE NEXT TIME HE APPEARED WITHIN THE GATES OF THE HALL FARM THE SPEECHES HAD ALWAYS REMAINED IMAGINARY
YET ADAM WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO JOIN THEM AFTER CHURCH AND SAY THAT HE WOULD WALK HOME WITH THEM THOUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE VILLAGE HE APPEARED TO BE CHIEFLY OCCUPIED WITH MARTY AND TOMMY TELLING THEM ABOUT THE SQUIRRELS IN BINTON COPPICE AND PROMISING TO TAKE THEM THERE SOME DAY
BUT ADAM HAD BEEN REFRESHED BY HIS LONG REST AND WITH HIS HABITUAL IMPATIENCE OF MERE PASSIVITY HE WAS EAGER TO BEGIN THE NEW DAY AND SUBDUE SADNESS BY HIS STRONG WILL AND STRONG ARM
YET IN HER SECRET HEART SHE WAS GLAD TO HAVE HIM BY HER SIDE FOR SHE WOULD PERHAPS LEARN FROM HIM HOW IT WAS ARTHUR HAD NOT COME TO CHURCH
WITH SO LITTLE MONEY IN HER POCKET AND THE WAY SO LONG AND DIFFICULT
THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WHITTAWS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MRS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
SHE IS VERY SULLEN AND WILL SCARCELY MAKE ANSWER WHEN SHE IS SPOKEN TO OH SIR IT MAY PLEASE GOD TO OPEN HER HEART STILL
I HAVE SEEN MANY AN EXCELLENT MATRON WHO COULD HAVE NEVER IN HER BEST DAYS HAVE BEEN HANDSOME AND YET SHE HAD A PACKET OF YELLOW LOVE-LETTERS IN A PRIVATE DRAWER AND SWEET CHILDREN SHOWERED KISSES ON HER SALLOW CHEEKS
AT THIS VERY TABLE AMONG MR POYSER'S MEN THERE IS THAT BIG BEN THOLOWAY A VERY POWERFUL THRESHER BUT DETECTED MORE THAN ONCE IN CARRYING AWAY HIS MASTER'S CORN IN HIS POCKETS--AN ACTION WHICH AS BEN WAS NOT A PHILOSOPHER COULD HARDLY BE ASCRIBED TO ABSENCE OF MIND
ADOLPHUS IRWINE HAD NOT HAD THESE TWO HOPELESSLY MAIDEN SISTERS HIS LOT WOULD HAVE BEEN SHAPED QUITE DIFFERENTLY
IT WOULD BE A POOR RESULT OF ALL OUR ANGUISH AND OUR WRESTLING IF WE WON NOTHING BUT OUR OLD SELVES AT THE END OF IT--IF WE COULD RETURN TO THE SAME BLIND LOVES THE SAME SELF-CONFIDENT BLAME THE SAME LIGHT THOUGHTS OF HUMAN SUFFERING THE SAME FRIVOLOUS GOSSIP OVER BLIGHTED HUMAN LIVES THE SAME FEEBLE SENSE OF THAT UNKNOWN TOWARDS WHICH WE HAVE SENT FORTH IRREPRESSIBLE CRIES IN OUR LONELINESS
SHE MUST GO AWAY GO WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND HER
BARTLE KEPT HIS EYE ON THE MOVING FIGURE TILL IT PASSED INTO THE DARKNESS WHILE VIXEN IN A STATE OF DIVIDED AFFECTION HAD TWICE RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE TO BESTOW A PARENTHETIC LICK ON HER PUPPIES
AND NOW THE FIRST THING SHE DID ON ENTERING HER ROOM WAS TO SEAT HERSELF IN THIS CHAIR AND LOOK OUT ON THE PEACEFUL FIELDS BEYOND WHICH THE LARGE MOON WAS RISING JUST ABOVE THE HEDGEROW ELMS
IF I WERE NOT AS POOR AS A RAT I WOULD GLADLY INVEST SOME MONEY IN THAT WAY FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING YOU SETTLED ON THE ESTATE
SHE WAS ONLY ARRESTED BY THE NAME
DEEPER AND DEEPER THE SILENCE SEEMED TO BECOME LIKE THE DEEPENING NIGHT WHILE THE JURYMEN'S NAMES WERE CALLED OVER AND THE PRISONER WAS MADE TO HOLD UP HER HAND AND THE JURY WERE ASKED FOR THEIR VERDICT
AND IF I LONG FOR A MOMENT TO FOLLOW THE VOICE WHICH CALLS ME TO ANOTHER LAND THAT I KNOW NOT I CANNOT BUT FEAR THAT MY SOUL MIGHT HEREAFTER YEARN FOR THAT EARLY BLESSEDNESS WHICH I HAD FORSAKEN
SHE TOOK THEM OUT NOW AND ATE THEM EAGERLY AND THEN SAT STILL AGAIN LOOKING AT THE POOL
I TOLD YOU THAT CAPITAL THING I HEARD HER SAY ABOUT CRAIG--THAT HE WAS LIKE A COCK WHO THOUGHT THE SUN HAD RISEN TO HEAR HIM CROW
I'LL STAND BY HER--I'LL OWN HER--FOR ALL SHE'S BEEN DECEITFUL
THAT WILL NEVER DO BECAUSE YOU'LL WANT MANAGING AND A SILLY WOMAN CAN'T MANAGE YOU
HE COULD FEEL NOTHING BUT THAT DEATH WAS IN ARTHUR'S FACE AND THAT HE WAS HELPLESS BEFORE IT
BY WHICH EVIL-SOUNDING RULE OF CONDUCT HE MEANT WHAT WAS AFTER ALL RATHER VIRTUOUS THAN OTHERWISE NAMELY THAT MEN WHO HAD HORSES TO BE SHOD MUST BE TREATED WITH RESPECT
THEN ADMIRED ON SOMBRE MORNINGS AS THE BEST RIDER ON THE BEST HORSE IN THE HUNT
SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SELL MOST OF THE THINGS OUT OF HER BASKET BUT SHE'D THANKFULLY GIVE A SHILLING FOR A BED
HIS EXASPERATION AT HETTY'S SUFFERING--AND ALSO AT THE SENSE THAT SHE WAS POSSIBLY THRUST FOR EVER OUT OF HIS OWN REACH--DEAFENED HIM TO ANY PLEA FOR THE MISCALLED FRIEND WHO HAD WROUGHT THIS MISERY
THE CLOCK HASN'T BEEN PUT FORRARD FOR THE FIRST TIME TO-DAY I RECKON THE FACT WAS HETTY HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN THE DIFFERENCE OF THE CLOCKS WHEN SHE TOLD CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE THAT SHE SET OUT AT EIGHT AND THIS WITH HER LINGERING PACE HAD MADE HER NEARLY HALF AN HOUR LATER THAN USUAL
I'M NOT HUNGRY
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT HETTY IN SPITE OF HERSELF BEGAN TO CRY HALF OUT OF ILL TEMPER AT THE DENIAL HALF OUT OF THE DAY'S REPRESSED SADNESS
SHE MUST COME AND SEE THEM
THE VERY BULL-DOG LOOKED LESS SAVAGE AS IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH A SMALLER BITE THAN USUAL
WAS HE IN THE LOAMSHIRE MILITIA
THEY'RE FIT TO DIE WI LAUGHING I CAN SEE WELL WELL SO MUCH THE BETTER IT AMUSES EM SAID MR POYSER WHO DID NOT EASILY TAKE AN IRRITABLE VIEW OF THINGS
O GOD ADAM GROANED AS HE LEANED ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED BLANKLY AT THE FACE OF THE WATCH AND MEN HAVE SUFFERED LIKE THIS BEFORE...AND POOR HELPLESS YOUNG THINGS HAVE SUFFERED LIKE HER....SUCH A LITTLE WHILE AGO LOOKING SO HAPPY AND SO PRETTY...KISSING EM ALL HER GRANDFATHER AND ALL OF EM AND THEY WISHING HER LUCK....O MY POOR POOR HETTY...DOST THINK ON IT NOW ADAM STARTED AND LOOKED ROUND TOWARDS THE DOOR
EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WAS A RUSH OF MORE INTENSE FEELING TOWARDS HER WHICH CHASED AWAY OTHER IMAGES THAN HETTY
I HAVE A FRIEND OR TWO WHOSE CLASS OF FEATURES IS SUCH THAT THE APOLLO CURL ON THE SUMMIT OF THEIR BROWS WOULD BE DECIDEDLY TRYING
BUT THAT IS NATURE'S WAY
HER SORROW AS A MAIDEN DAUGHTER WAS UNMIXED WITH ANY OTHER THOUGHTS THAN THOSE OF ANXIETY ABOUT FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS AND HER OWN FUTURE LOT
PERHAPS THEY WERE ALREADY MARRIED
HE HAD NOT COME FOR THE SAKE OF A LESSON TO-NIGHT AND HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF PERSONAL MATTERS TOO FULL OF THE LAST TWO HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN HETTY'S PRESENCE FOR HIM TO AMUSE HIMSELF WITH A BOOK TILL SCHOOL WAS OVER
THERE WAS NO HAVING HIS OWN WAY IN THE STABLES
IN THIS SITUATION SHE WAS DESCRIED BY HER DISCREET MATRONLY COUSIN WHO LOST NO TIME IN COMING UP HAVING JUST GIVEN THE BABY INTO HER HUSBAND'S CHARGE
WHERE ARE THEY NO I'VE NOT BROUGHT EM SAID ADAM TURNING ROUND TO INDICATE THAT HE WISHED TO WALK BACK WITH MR POYSER
HOWEVER WE ARE TO ASTONISH THE ECHOES ON THE 30TH OF JULY
THE FETTERS OF HER SIN ARE UPON HER AND SHE CANNOT STIR TO COME TO THEE
FASTER AND FASTER WENT THE SENSITIVE MEG AT EVERY SLIGHT SIGN FROM HER RIDER TILL THE CANTER HAD PASSED INTO A SWIFT GALLOP
HE FORESAW ENOUGH
NOT BEFORE A GREAT DROP HAD FALLEN ON HER ROSE-COLOURED STRINGS--SHE KNEW THAT QUITE WELL
AND TO-DAY SHE THOUGHT MORE THAN USUAL ABOUT HER NECK AND ARMS
AN IF MARTIN'S I THE RICK-YARD HE'LL LIKE A CUP
HOW SHE WILL DOTE ON HER CHILDREN
IT WAS ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE DEAD ALREADY AND KNEW THAT SHE WAS DEAD AND LONGED TO GET BACK TO LIFE AGAIN
WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING BESIDE GOSPEL I THIS WORLD
HE ONLY SAID TAKE A BIT THEN AND ANOTHER SUP ADAM FOR THE LOVE OF ME
WHY DINAH HASN'T GOT A HUSBAND SPARE HER SAID MRS POYSER PLACING A SEED-CAKE ON THE TABLE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF TO POUR OUT THE TEA
COME CRAIG SAID ADAM THAT'S A LITTLE TOO STRONG
DOUBTLESS TOTTY WAS BELOW BEHIND THE SCREEN OF PEAS
THE LITTLE RING OF DARK HAIR HE FELT SURE WAS HER OWN
IF ARTHUR HAD HAD TIME TO THINK AT ALL HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD FEEL FLUTTERED TOO BE CONSCIOUS OF BLUSHING TOO--IN FACT LOOK AND FEEL AS FOOLISH AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE INSTEAD OF MEETING JUST WHAT HE EXPECTED
HE WAS FONDER OF CHURCH HISTORY THAN OF DIVINITY AND HAD MUCH MORE INSIGHT INTO MEN'S CHARACTERS THAN INTEREST IN THEIR OPINIONS
IN OUR TIMES OF BITTER SUFFERING THERE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THESE PAUSES WHEN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS BENUMBED TO EVERYTHING BUT SOME TRIVIAL PERCEPTION OR SENSATION
WHY YOU MIGHT THINK YOU WAR COME TO A DEAD-HOUSE SAID MRS POYSER AS HE STOOD IN THE OPEN DOORWAY
WHY SHE LOOKS LIKE A TOTTY
I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE HAVE NOT BEEN UGLY AND EVEN AMONG THOSE LORDS OF THEIR KIND THE BRITISH SQUAT FIGURES ILL-SHAPEN NOSTRILS AND DINGY COMPLEXIONS ARE NOT STARTLING EXCEPTIONS
ARTHUR HEARD THE MOVEMENT AND TURNING ROUND MET THE SAD BUT SOFTENED LOOK WITH WHICH ADAM SAID IT'S TRUE WHAT YOU SAY SIR
WHAT IS MY LOVE OR MY PLEADING
INDEED ON RECENT MARKET-DAYS HE HAD MORE THAN ONCE BOASTED OF HER DISCERNMENT IN THIS VERY MATTER OF SHORTHORNS
YOU'VE HAD FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MORE THAN I'VE HAD AND I THINK YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN A BETTER SCHOOL TO YOU THAN COLLEGE HAS BEEN TO ME WHY SIR YOU SEEM TO THINK O COLLEGE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT BARTLE MASSEY DOES
I'N DONE EVERYTHIN NOW AN HE'D LIKE THEE TO GO AN LOOK AT HIM FOR HE WAR ALLAYS SO PLEASED WHEN THEE WAST MILD TO HIM ADAM TURNED ROUND AT ONCE AND SAID YES MOTHER
THEY PUT UP THEIR GLASSES AND STARED AND WHISPERED
AS SOON AS THE BOYS HAD BOTH SET OFF HE LOOKED DOWN AT HETTY AND SAID WON'T YOU HANG ON MY ARM HETTY IN A PLEADING TONE AS IF HE HAD ALREADY ASKED HER AND SHE HAD REFUSED
IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO WAIT A MINUTE ARTHUR STOOD STILL WITHOUT SPEAKING AND NO OTHER WORD PASSED BETWEEN THEM TILL THEY WERE AT THE SIDE ENTRANCE WHERE HE HOPED TO GET IN WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ANY ONE
ALWAYS KNEW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THINGS COULD TELL HER UNCLE HOW TO PROP THE HOVEL AND HAD MENDED THE CHURN IN NO TIME
SAVIOUR
I CAN'T HAVE HER TOLD YET
DINAH DUSTED UP TO THE VERY EDGE OF THESE AND THEN HESITATED LOOKING AT THEM WITH A LONGING BUT TIMID EYE
AND IF IT'S TRUE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG--AND IF IT'S ONLY BEEN TRIFLING AND FLIRTING AS YOU CALL IT AS LL BE PUT AN END TO BY YOUR GOING AWAY--WHY THEN I'D WAIT AND HOPE HER HEART UD TURN TO ME AFTER ALL
THE FEAR AND HASTE TOGETHER PRODUCED A STATE OF STRONG EXCITEMENT BEFORE HE REACHED THE RECTORY GATE AND OUTSIDE IT HE SAW THE DEEP MARKS OF A RECENT HOOF ON THE GRAVEL
THE POOL HAD ITS WINTRY DEPTH NOW
CHAPTER XLVII THE LAST MOMENT IT WAS A SIGHT THAT SOME PEOPLE REMEMBERED BETTER EVEN THAN THEIR OWN SORROWS--THE SIGHT IN THAT GREY CLEAR MORNING WHEN THE FATAL CART WITH THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN IT WAS DESCRIED BY THE WAITING WATCHING MULTITUDE CLEAVING ITS WAY TOWARDS THE HIDEOUS SYMBOL OF A DELIBERATELY INFLICTED SUDDEN DEATH
AND IT WAS TRUE THAT HETTY LISTENED WITH AN INTEREST WHICH BROUGHT A NEW LIGHT INTO HER EYES AND A HALF-SMILE UPON HER LIPS
WE MUSTN'T BE IN A HURRY TO FIX AND CHOOSE OUR OWN LOT
THAT'S A SORE MISCHIEF I'VE OFTEN SEEN WITH THE POOR CURATES JUMPING INTO A BIT OF A LIVING ALL OF A SUDDEN
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THAT THIS WAS THE VOICE OF THE HONEST WARM-HEARTED ARTHUR WHOM HE HAD LOVED AND BEEN PROUD OF IN OLD DAYS
HE HAD SAID NO WORD WITH THE PURPOSE OF DECEIVING HER--HER VISION WAS ALL SPUN BY HER OWN CHILDISH FANCY--BUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS SPUN HALF OUT OF HIS OWN ACTIONS
YET SHE TOOK CARE OF HER MONEY STILL
BUT WE WONNA SPARE HER FOR ANYBODY ELSE ON'Y HER HUSBAND HUSBAND SAID MARTY WHO WAS AT THE MOST PROSAIC AND LITERAL PERIOD OF THE BOYISH MIND
I CAN HOLD TOTTY NOW IF AUNT WANTS ME WHY WHAT NONSENSE THAT IS TO TALK SAID MRS POYSER
THEE WANTS THY SUPPER I'LL WARRAND
I MADE THEM MYSELF AND HAD KEPT THEM BY ME EVER SINCE MY LAST CHILD WAS BORN
SHE FELT UNABLE EVEN TO SAY NO BUT COULD ONLY LOOK AWAY FROM HIM AND WIPE THE TEARS FROM HER CHEEK
I HEAR MOTHER STIRRING SAID SETH
SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE
YE GALLOWS YOUNG DOG SAID SANDY JIM WITH SOME PATERNAL PRIDE IF YE DONNA KEEP THAT STICK QUIET I'LL TEK IT FROM YE
HE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WAS LIKELY TO BE SAID BY THE WITNESSES ON THE TRIAL FOR HE HAD SHRUNK FROM ALL THE PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH HETTY'S ARREST AND ACCUSATION
IT SEEMED LONG TO BOTH OF THEM--THAT INWARD STRUGGLE OF ARTHUR'S--BEFORE HE SAID FEEBLY I PROMISE
COME HERE TOTTY ELSE YOUR LITTLE FACE ULL BE BURNT TO A SCRATCHIN
AND UNWILLING TO DISTURB HIS MOTHER AND SETH AND ALSO TO ENCOUNTER THEIR QUESTIONS AT THAT HOUR HE THREW HIMSELF WITHOUT UNDRESSING ON A BED AT THE WAGGON OVERTHROWN AND SLEPT HARD FROM PURE WEARINESS
BUT SIR WE ARE LED ON LIKE THE LITTLE CHILDREN BY A WAY THAT WE KNOW NOT
IN THE VERY FIRST SHOCK OF DISCOVERING THAT HETTY HAD NOT BEEN TO SNOWFIELD THE THOUGHT OF ARTHUR HAD DARTED THROUGH ADAM LIKE A SHARP PANG BUT HE TRIED FOR SOME TIME TO WARD OFF ITS RETURN BY BUSYING HIMSELF WITH MODES OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE ALARMING FACT QUITE APART FROM THAT INTOLERABLE THOUGHT
IT'S ONE O THEM CHANCY THINGS AS FOOLS THRIVE ON THIS UNREASONABLE BEHAVIOUR OF THE WEATHER HOWEVER COULD DISPLEASE NO ONE ELSE IN HAYSLOPE BESIDES MR CRAIG
SHE FEELS THE BRACELETS ON HER ARMS AND TREADS ON A SOFT CARPET IN FRONT OF A TALL MIRROR
AS IT WAS HE FOUND AN OUTLET FOR HIS FEELING IN DRINKING HIS ALE UNUSUALLY FAST AND SETTING DOWN HIS GLASS WITH A SWING OF HIS ARM AND A DETERMINED RAP
THE ONE THING--THE ONE PERSON--HER MIND HAD RESTED ON IN ITS DULL WEARINESS HAD SLIPPED AWAY FROM HER AND PEEVISH MISERY FILLED HER EYES WITH TEARS
THEE ARTNA GOING TO POYSER'S THYSELF TO-NIGHT SAID SETH RATHER TIMIDLY AS HE TURNED TO LEAVE THE WORKSHOP
BUT AFTER THAT SHE STOOD LIKE A WHITE IMAGE STARING DOWN AT HER HANDS AND SEEMING NEITHER TO HEAR NOR SEE ANYTHING
THEE'ST DONE IT NOW SAID MR POYSER A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK
IN THAT LEAFY FLOWERY BUSHY TIME TO LOOK FOR ANY ONE IN THIS GARDEN WAS LIKE PLAYING AT HIDE-AND-SEEK THERE WERE THE TALL HOLLYHOCKS BEGINNING TO FLOWER AND DAZZLE THE EYE WITH THEIR PINK WHITE AND YELLOW
NO RAIN HAD FALLEN FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND THE WEATHER WAS PERFECT FOR THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
AND NOW THE HALF-WEANED CALVES THAT HAVE BEEN SHELTERING THEMSELVES IN A GORSE-BUILT HOVEL AGAINST THE LEFT-HAND WALL COME OUT AND SET UP A SILLY ANSWER TO THAT TERRIBLE BARK DOUBTLESS SUPPOSING THAT IT HAS REFERENCE TO BUCKETS OF MILK
SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID MILDLY WHAT DOST SAY MRS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW-SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS
BUT IT ISN'T MY WAY TO BE SEE-SAW ABOUT ANYTHING
IT STANDS TO SENSE MR CASSON WAS SAYING AS OLD MR POYSER AS IS TH OLDEST MAN I THE ROOM SHOULD SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE
THE HONOUR AND LOVE YOU BEAR HIM IS NOTHING BUT MEET FOR GOD HAS GIVEN HIM GREAT GIFTS AND HE USES THEM AS THE PATRIARCH JOSEPH DID WHO WHEN HE WAS EXALTED TO A PLACE OF POWER AND TRUST YET YEARNED WITH TENDERNESS TOWARDS HIS PARENT AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
NANCY AND MOLLY HAVING ALREADY HASTENED HOME SIDE BY SIDE EACH HOLDING CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN HER POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF A PRAYER-BOOK IN WHICH SHE COULD READ LITTLE BEYOND THE LARGE LETTERS AND THE AMENS
AND THE THOUGHT SOMETIMES CROSSED HIS MIND THAT THE FRIENDSHIP WHICH HAD ONCE SEEMED DEAD FOR EVER MIGHT REVIVE IN THE DAYS TO COME AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE GRAND OLD WOODS BUT WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER BECAUSE THEY WERE ARTHUR'S
THIS FILLS ME WITH TRUST FOR I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT THE BRETHREN SOMETIMES ERR IN MEASURING THE DIVINE LOVE BY THE SINNER'S KNOWLEDGE
AND ADAM WHO WAS NOT GIVEN TO HESITATION HESITATED HERE
WHY THEY'LL CAST IT UP TO THE LITTLE UN AS ISN'T FOUR EAR OLD SOME DAY--THEY'LL CAST IT UP T HER AS SHE'D A COUSIN TRIED AT THE SIZES FOR MURDER IT'LL BE THEIR OWN WICKEDNESS THEN SAID MRS POYSER WITH A SOB IN HER VOICE
BUT THEE'T SO ANGERED WI THY FEYTHER MORE NOR WI ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S BETTER THAN SPEAKING SOFT AND LETTING THINGS GO THE WRONG WAY I RECKON ISN'T IT
I'LL GO MR MASSEY--I'LL GO WITH YOU THERE WAS A DECISION IN ADAM'S MANNER WHICH WOULD HAVE PREVENTED BARTLE FROM OPPOSING HIM EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO
I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN I'M A-GOIN TO SETTLE I LIFE
HE WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF ASKING ABOUT HER
IT WAS AN AFFECTION PARTLY FILIAL PARTLY FRATERNAL--FRATERNAL ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM LIKE IRWINE'S COMPANY BETTER THAN THAT OF MOST YOUNGER MEN AND FILIAL ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM SHRINK STRONGLY FROM INCURRING IRWINE'S DISAPPROBATION
I WOULDN'T SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU ONCE SIR WHEN YOU ASKED ME--BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DO IT NOW FOR ALL I REFUSED THEN ARTHUR'S WHITE HAND WAS IN ADAM'S LARGE GRASP IN AN INSTANT AND WITH THAT ACTION THERE WAS A STRONG RUSH ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OLD BOYISH AFFECTION
LIKE ALL COMPLAINING WOMEN SHE COMPLAINED IN THE EXPECTATION OF BEING SOOTHED AND WHEN ADAM SAID NOTHING SHE WAS ONLY PROMPTED TO COMPLAIN MORE BITTERLY
HE WOULD NOT BE VACILLATING AGAIN--HE WOULD DO WHAT HE HAD MEANT TO DO THIS TIME
IF A MAN HAD GOT NO FEELINGS IT UD BE AS GOOD AS A DEMONSTRATION TO LISTEN TO WHAT GOES ON IN COURT
HE'S GONE TO ROSSETER TO SEE MR WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
ADAM LOOKED UP AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING AND SETH MOVED FORWARD TOWARDS THE BENCH HIMSELF TREMBLING SO THAT SPEECH DID NOT COME READILY
ON THE OLD BLACK SOW STRETCHED LANGUIDLY ON THE STRAW WHILE HER LARGEST YOUNG ONE FOUND AN EXCELLENT SPRING-BED ON HIS MOTHER'S FAT RIBS
HE'S EMPTY ENOUGH I THE UPPER STORY OR HE'D NIVER COME JIGGING AN STAMPING I THAT WAY LIKE A MAD GRASSHOPPER FOR THE GENTRY TO LOOK AT HIM
HE WAS TO GO INTO THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD GET UP SOMETHING OF THE SAME SORT TO ASTONISH OUR WEAK MINDS THE OPPORTUNITY WAS GONE
I BELIEVE IF I WERE TO BREAK MY NECK HE WOULD FEEL IT THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE THAT COULD BEFALL HIM AND YET IT SEEMS A PLEASURE TO HIM TO MAKE MY LIFE A SERIES OF PETTY ANNOYANCES AH MY BOY IT IS NOT ONLY WOMAN'S LOVE THAT IS TWO GREEK WORDS OMITTED AS OLD AESCHYLUS CALLS IT
IT MIGHT BE THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE WITH WORK AND ANXIETY NOW FOR SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS MRS POYSER HAD TAKEN ANOTHER COLD WHICH HAD BROUGHT ON INFLAMMATION AND THIS ILLNESS HAD CONFINED HER TO HER ROOM ALL THROUGH JANUARY
AND STILL MORE BY REGRETTING THAT SHE COULDNA HA ONE O THE LADS AND BE HER DAUGHTER
HE HAD NEVER MEANT BEFOREHAND TO DO ANYTHING HIS CONSCIENCE DISAPPROVED
SUCH THINGS ARE NOT WORK FOR A CARPENTER LIKE ADAM
LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
SO THE HOURS PASSED TO THE LOUD TICKING OF THE OLD DAY-CLOCK AND THE SOUND OF ADAM'S TOOLS
FOR THE BRETHREN AND SISTERS AT LEEDS ARE DESIROUS TO HAVE ME FOR A SHORT SPACE AMONG THEM WHEN I HAVE A DOOR OPENED ME AGAIN TO LEAVE SNOWFIELD
AND I WAS SO TIRED AND WEAK I WENT TO SLEEP....BUT OH THE BABY'S CRYING KEPT WAKING ME AND I THOUGHT THAT MAN AS LOOKED AT ME SO WAS COME AND LAYING HOLD OF ME
I'M NOT LIKE TO FORGET HIM I RECKON WHEN HE'S ALL O THEE I CAN GET SIGHT ON COME THEN GYP SAID ADAM WE'LL GO TO BED
AND YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO PART WITH EM HE ADDED LOOKING AT HER INQUIRINGLY
THE LITTLE MINX HAD FOUND A BLACK GOWN OF HER AUNT'S AND PINNED IT CLOSE ROUND HER NECK TO LOOK LIKE DINAH'S HAD MADE HER HAIR AS FLAT AS SHE COULD AND HAD TIED ON ONE OF DINAH'S HIGH-CROWNED BORDERLESS NET CAPS
AND AS HE WALKED ON MORE QUIETLY CHEWING THE CUD OF THIS NEW HOPE HIS ONLY UNEASINESS WAS THAT HE HAD BEHAVED IN A WAY WHICH MIGHT CHILL HETTY'S FEELING TOWARDS HIM
AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE PETITION THAT ADAM MIGHT NEVER BE CALLED TO SET UP HIS TENT IN A FAR COUNTRY BUT THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT BE CHEERED AND COMFORTED BY HIS PRESENCE ALL THE DAYS OF HER PILGRIMAGE LISBETH'S READY TEARS FLOWED AGAIN AND SHE WEPT ALOUD
I SHOULDNA WONDER IF I TURN METHODY AFORE THE NIGHT'S OUT AN BEGIN TO COORT THE PREACHER LIKE SETH BEDE WHY SETH'S LOOKING RETHER TOO HIGH I SHOULD THINK SAID MR CASSON
STILL THE OLD WOMAN WAS SO SLOW OF
I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO EXPECT SOME DEPTH OF SOUL BEHIND A DEEP GREY EYE WITH A LONG DARK EYELASH IN SPITE OF AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS SHOWN ME THAT THEY MAY GO ALONG WITH DECEIT PECULATION AND STUPIDITY
HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS
COULDN'T YOU FIND SOMETHING ELSE FOR THIS GIRL AND SAVE THAT GRIM-LOOKING GOWN FOR ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN I HAVE BOUGHT NOTHING BUT WHAT IS USEFUL AND SUBSTANTIAL SAID MISS LYDIA ADJUSTING HER OWN LACE
OFTEN IN THE LAST FORTNIGHT ADAM HAD IMAGINED HIMSELF AS CLOSE TO ARTHUR AS THIS ASSAILING HIM WITH WORDS THAT SHOULD BE AS HARROWING AS THE VOICE OF REMORSE FORCING UPON HIM A JUST SHARE IN THE MISERY HE HAD CAUSED
SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD GODFATHERS AND GODMOTHERS LEARNED THEIR CATECHISM BEEN CONFIRMED AND GONE TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY AND YET FOR ANY PRACTICAL RESULT OF STRENGTH IN LIFE OR TRUST IN DEATH HAVE NEVER APPROPRIATED A SINGLE CHRISTIAN IDEA OR CHRISTIAN FEELING
ADAM SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN STRENGTH AS WITH THE ONCOMING OF THIS DREAD HE KNELT DOWN BY ARTHUR'S SIDE AND LIFTED HIS HEAD FROM AMONG THE FERN
IN THE CRIMSON DAMASK EASY-CHAIR SAT MR IRWINE WITH THAT RADIANT FRESHNESS WHICH HE ALWAYS HAD WHEN HE CAME FROM HIS MORNING TOILET
AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY THAT MR IRWINE WAS ALTOGETHER BELIED BY THE GENERIC CLASSIFICATION ASSIGNED HIM
SHE MADE HIS MOTHER ANGRY BY COMING INTO THE HOUSE
WHAT WILL BE THE END THE END OF HER OBJECTLESS WANDERING APART FROM ALL LOVE CARING FOR HUMAN BEINGS ONLY THROUGH HER PRIDE CLINGING TO LIFE ONLY AS THE HUNTED WOUNDED BRUTE CLINGS TO IT
SHONE ON THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE TOO AND MADE THEM A-FLAME WITH A GLORY BEYOND THAT OF AMBER OR AMETHYST
BUT MY HEART WAS BEGINNING TO HUNGER AFTER AN EQUAL LOVE FROM YOU
THESE CLOISTERS MAKE A DELIGHTFUL DINING-ROOM ON A HOT DAY
PRONE TO EXCURSION-TRAINS ART MUSEUMS PERIODICAL LITERATURE AND EXCITING NOVELS
A GREAT DEAL OF HARD WORK IS DONE BY AGENTS WHO ARE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED
HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER FOR ANY NEW FEELING TO TRIUMPH
POOR GRANDFATHER
IT TAKES THE TASTE OUT O MY MOUTH FOR THINGS WHEN I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE A HEAVY CONSCIENCE AFTER EM
FOR HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOR EVER"--A QUOTATION WHICH MAY SEEM TO HAVE SLIGHT BEARING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION BUT AS WITH EVERY OTHER ANOMALY ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE WILL SHOW IT TO BE A NATURAL SEQUENCE
THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT
ADAM NEEDED THE CALM INFLUENCE
YOU MAY SAY WHAT YOU LIKE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S RELIGION
WOULD HE PRESS IT
THE TEARS CAME THIS TIME--GREAT RUSHING TEARS THAT BLINDED HER AND BLOTCHED THE PAPER
AND WHEN HETTY AND ADAM ENTERED THE HOUSE-PLACE MR POYSER WAS SEATED IN THE THREE-CORNERED CHAIR AND THE GRANDFATHER IN THE LARGE ARM-CHAIR OPPOSITE LOOKING ON WITH PLEASANT EXPECTATION WHILE THE SUPPER WAS BEING LAID ON THE OAK TABLE
THEN AT THE END OF THE TABLE OPPOSITE HIS MASTER THERE WAS ALICK THE SHEPHERD AND HEAD-MAN WITH THE RUDDY FACE AND BROAD SHOULDERS NOT ON THE BEST TERMS WITH OLD KESTER
HE WAS NO SOONER ON THE GROUND THAN IT BECAME OBVIOUS WHY THE STICK WAS NECESSARY--THE LEFT LEG WAS MUCH SHORTER THAN THE RIGHT
I'M LOATH TO THINK YOU'D SPEAK FALSE TO ME AND I'LL BELIEVE YOUR WORD HOWEVER THINGS MAY LOOK YOU WOULD BE WRONGING HETTY MORE THAN ME NOT TO BELIEVE IT SAID ARTHUR ALMOST VIOLENTLY STARTING UP FROM THE OTTOMAN AND MOVING AWAY
HER LITTLE BUTTERFLY SOUL FLUTTERED INCESSANTLY BETWEEN MEMORY AND DUBIOUS EXPECTATION
IT WOULD NEVER DO HE FEARED FOR HIS MOTHER TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS MARRIED
MRS POYSER HOWEVER THOUGH SHE NOTICED THE BONNET DEFERRED REMARKING ON IT UNTIL SHE HAD DISBURDENED HERSELF OF HER SURPRISE AT MR IRWINE'S BEHAVIOUR
IT'S HEAVIER NOW WI POOR BOB THOLER IN'T
I'D LIKE YOU TO STAY WI US TILL YOU'VE GOT A GOOD HUSBAND
IN A MINUTE OR TWO HE TURNED ROUND AND SAID I WILL COME DINAH...TO-MORROW MORNING...IF IT MUST BE
GENUINE ELBOW POLISH AS MRS POYSER CALLED IT FOR SHE THANKED GOD SHE NEVER HAD ANY OF YOUR VARNISHED RUBBISH IN HER HOUSE
BUT HE WAS NOT STUNNED OR CONFOUNDED
DON'T THINK I WILL EVER STAY AWAY FROM YOU IF YOU'RE IN REAL WANT OF ME
AND THE DREAD OF BODILY HARDSHIP MINGLED WITH THE DREAD OF SHAME
AND OFTEN TOO HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT SUCH A MEETING HAD BETTER NOT BE
ARTHUR'S WAS A MUCH COMMONER BRITISH FACE AND THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS NEW-FASHIONED CLOTHES WAS MORE AKIN TO THE YOUNG FARMER'S TASTE IN COSTUME THAN MR IRWINE'S POWDER AND THE WELL-BRUSHED BUT WELL-WORN BLACK WHICH SEEMED TO BE HIS CHOSEN SUIT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS
THE SMALL CHURCH WITH ITS RED-TILED ROOF LOOKING HUMBLE EVEN AMONG THE FADED HALF-TIMBERED HOUSES
BUT HE HAD TOO COOL A HEAD NOT TO ESTIMATE TO THE FULL THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE TO BE OVERCOME
I COULD ALMOST FANCY IT WAS THIRTY YEARS BACK AND I WAS A LITTLE GELL AT HOME LOOKING AT JUDITH AS SHE SAT AT HER WORK AFTER SHE'D DONE THE HOUSE UP
THE EYELASHES THOUGH NO DARKER WERE LONG AND ABUNDANT--NOTHING WAS LEFT BLURRED OR UNFINISHED
ADAM TOOK OUT THE LETTER BUT HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND STILL WHILE HE SAID IN A TONE OF TENDER ENTREATY DON'T YOU BEAR ME ILL WILL HETTY BECAUSE I'M THE MEANS O BRINGING YOU THIS PAIN
THE SQUARE O FOUR IS SIXTEEN AND YOU MUST LENGTHEN YOUR LEVER IN PROPORTION TO YOUR WEIGHT IS AS TRUE WHEN A MAN'S MISERABLE AS WHEN HE'S HAPPY
CAN THEY BURY THE MAN WITHOUT A COFFIN
SEE THERE
BUT LEAVE ME ALONE MOTHER AND LET ME GET ON WITH THE WORK LISBETH DARED NOT SAY ANY MORE
THE MASTER HAD SOMEBODY WITH HIM HE SAID BUT HE HEARD THE STUDY DOOR OPEN--THE STRANGER SEEMED TO BE COMING OUT AND AS ADAM WAS IN A HURRY HE WOULD LET THE MASTER KNOW AT ONCE
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM NOW TO DWELL ON THE REMEMBRANCE--IMPOSSIBLE TO RECALL THE FEELINGS AND REFLECTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN DECISIVE WITH HIM THEN ANY MORE THAN TO RECALL THE PECULIAR SCENT OF THE AIR THAT HAD FRESHENED HIM WHEN HE FIRST OPENED HIS WINDOW
HE SAID THEN THANK YOU
THERE WAS PERFECT STILLNESS ABOUT THE HOUSE
SHE HAD TRIED POOR DINAH BY RETURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE QUESTION WHY SHE MUST GO AWAY
MAKING THE CHILD NAUGHTY WHEN SHE'D BE GOOD IF YOU'D LET HER
AND HE WAS GONE
CHAPTER LI SUNDAY MORNING LISBETH'S TOUCH OF RHEUMATISM COULD NOT BE MADE TO APPEAR SERIOUS ENOUGH TO DETAIN DINAH ANOTHER NIGHT FROM THE HALL FARM NOW SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND TO LEAVE HER AUNT SO SOON AND AT EVENING THE FRIENDS MUST PART
WHAT'S THE MATTER WI YE SAID BESS THE MATRON TAKING UP THE BUNDLE AND EXAMINING IT
I TELL YOU THERE ISN'T A THING UNDER THE SUN THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AT ALL BUT WHAT A MAN CAN DO BETTER THAN A WOMAN UNLESS IT'S BEARING CHILDREN AND THEY DO THAT IN A POOR MAKE-SHIFT WAY
ONE OF THEM WAS THE VERY IMAGE OF ITS MOTHER BUT IT HAD TWO OR THREE OF ITS FATHER'S TRICKS NOTWITHSTANDING
DID A REMEMBRANCE OF DINAH COME ACROSS HER MIND
THEY DON'T KEEP YOUR LATE HOURS I KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEIR HOURS SAID BARTLE DRYLY CUTTING HIS BREAD AND NOT SHRINKING FROM THE CRUST
HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A SERIOUS BUSINESS OF THIS AFFAIR
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF HER TO KNOW AS I'LL NIVER TAKE A SERVANT FROM HER HOUSE AGAIN--ALL HUGGER-MUGGER--AND YOU'D NIVER KNOW WHEN YOU WENT IN WHETHER IT WAS MONDAY OR FRIDAY THE WASH DRAGGIN ON TO TH END O THE WEEK
WHAT SHOULD SHE DO WHEN IT WAS GONE
I USED TO BE A PRETTY GOOD UN AT DANCING MYSELF WHEN I WAS LIGHTER BUT I COULD NIVER HA HIT IT JUST TO TH HAIR LIKE THAT IT'S LITTLE MATTER WHAT HIS LIMBS ARE TO MY THINKING RE-TURNED MRS POYSER
MR CRAIG WAS NEVER AWARE THAT HIS CONVERSATION AND ADVANCES WERE RECEIVED COLDLY FOR TO SHIFT ONE'S POINT OF VIEW BEYOND CERTAIN LIMITS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THE MOST LIBERAL AND EXPANSIVE MIND
SOON SHE IS IN THE SCANTLANDS WHERE THE GRASSY LAND SLOPES GRADUALLY DOWNWARDS AND SHE LEAVES THE LEVEL GROUND TO FOLLOW THE SLOPE
THEY SEE THEE IN THE NIGHT-WATCHES AND THEIR HEARTS BURN WITHIN THEM AS THOU TALKEST WITH THEM BY THE WAY
AT LAST THE MINUTE-HAND OF THE OLD-FASHIONED BRAZEN-FACED TIMEPIECE WAS ON THE LAST QUARTER TO EIGHT AND THERE WAS EVERY REASON FOR ITS BEING TIME TO GET READY FOR DEPARTURE
SHE'LL BE NONE DISPLEASED SAID ADAM EMPHATICALLY GETTING UP AND THROWING OFF HIS COAT
IN THE YEARS TO COME IF MY AUNT'S HEALTH SHOULD FAIL OR SHE SHOULD OTHERWISE NEED ME I SHALL RETURN YOU KNOW BEST DINAH SAID ADAM
FOLKS MUN HA HOSS-SHOES PRAICHIN OR NO PRAICHIN
AS LONG AS YE CAN STIR HAND AND FOOT THE MEN THINK YE'RE HEARTY
AND SETH WAS IN THE BACK KITCHEN MAKING A FIRE OF STICKS THAT HE MIGHT GET THE KETTLE TO BOIL AND PERSUADE HIS MOTHER TO HAVE A CUP OF TEA AN INDULGENCE WHICH SHE RARELY ALLOWED HERSELF
MESTER BURGE IS IN THE RIGHT ON'T TO WANT HIM TO GO PARTNERS AND MARRY HIS DAUGHTER IF IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY
THE LOVE THAT HAD BROUGHT HOPE AND COMFORT IN THE HOUR OF DESPAIR THE LOVE THAT HAD FOUND ITS WAY TO THE DARK PRISON CELL AND TO POOR HETTY'S DARKER SOUL--THIS STRONG GENTLE LOVE WAS TO BE ADAM'S COMPANION AND HELPER TILL DEATH
A FARM-HOUSE IS A FINE THING FOR THEM AS LOOK ON AN DON'T KNOW THE LIFTIN AN THE STANNIN AN THE WORRITIN O TH INSIDE AS BELONGS TO'T WHY MRS POYSER YOU WOULDN'T LIKE TO LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE BUT IN A FARM-HOUSE SO WELL AS YOU MANAGE IT SAID ADAM TAKING THE BASIN
AND IT'S A POOR LOOK-OUT TO COME INTO THE WORLD TO MAKE YOUR FELLOW-CREATURES WORSE OFF INSTEAD O BETTER
SHE COULDN'T FIND HER PLACES AT CHURCH AS SALLY RANN COULD SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN TITTERING WHEN SHE CURCHEYED TO MR IRWINE
WHAT AN OVERPOWERING PRESENCE THAT FIRST PRIVACY IS
IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CONVULSED THROAT WAS QUIET AND EVEN THEN THEY SAT SOME TIME IN STILLNESS AND DARKNESS HOLDING EACH OTHER'S HANDS
YOU SAID ONCE AS WOMEN WOULDNA HA BEEN A BAD INVENTION IF THEY'D ALL BEEN LIKE DINAH I MEANT HER VOICE MAN--I MEANT HER VOICE THAT WAS ALL SAID BARTLE
I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL
BUT DEEPER THAN ALL HER PEEVISHNESS LAY THE NEED THAT HER SON SHOULD LOVE HER
THEY'RE NOT TO BE COME NEAR BY THE HATCHET THOUGH
I SHALL WRITE TO HIM THE FIRST THING WHEN WE GET HOME EPILOGUE IT IS NEAR THE END OF JUNE IN 1807
SPLENDID OLD LADIES WHO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRESS IN THE MORNING HAVE OFTEN SLIGHT SYMPATHY WITH SICKLY DAUGHTERS
SETH AND ME ARE GOING TO CARRY HIM IN
AND IT'S LIKE ENOUGH THE TRAMPS KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING AS WELL AS WE DO OURSENS
YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED
LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND
FROM HER GIRLHOOD UPWARDS SHE HAD HAD EXPERIENCE AMONG THE SICK AND THE MOURNING AMONG MINDS HARDENED AND SHRIVELLED THROUGH POVERTY AND IGNORANCE AND HAD GAINED THE SUBTLEST PERCEPTION OF THE MODE IN WHICH THEY COULD BEST BE TOUCHED AND SOFTENED INTO WILLINGNESS TO RECEIVE WORDS OF SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION OR WARNING
WE SHALL MEET WITH BETTER FEELINGS SOME MONTHS HENCE
WILL YOU PLEASE TO STEP IN SIR AN TEK SOMETHINK NO I MUST BE GETTING ON TO ROSSETER
ONE OF THESE WAS LISBETH BEDE AND SETH WENT WITH HER--NOT FROM FILIAL ATTENTION ONLY FOR HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD NOT LET HIM JOIN IN DANCING
THE FACT ENTERED INTO HIS FUTURE PROSPECTS WHICH HE WOULD LIKE TO SEEM PROMISING IN HER EYES
HE'D MUCH ADO TO SPEAK POOR MAN HIS VOICE TREMBLED SO
AN THERE'S THE YORK AND LANKESTER ROSES BEAUTIFUL IN THE GARDEN NOW--YOU'LL LIKE TO SEE EM
PRAY TAKE A SEAT SAID MRS POYSER RELIEVED A LITTLE BY THIS COMPLIMENT AND THE CAPTAIN'S EVIDENT GOOD-HUMOUR BUT STILL GLANCING ANXIOUSLY AT MR IRWINE WHO SHE SAW WAS LOOKING AT DINAH AND ADVANCING TOWARDS HER
QUIET MARY BURGE WHO SAT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HETTY WAS CROSS AND THAT ADAM'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HER THOUGHT THAT SO SENSIBLE A MAN AS ADAM MUST BE REFLECTING ON THE SMALL VALUE OF BEAUTY IN A WOMAN WHOSE TEMPER WAS BAD
WOULD YOU PUT THE WOODS INTO HIS HANDS AND LET HIM MAKE HIS OWN BARGAINS
GOOD-BYE HE HASTENED OUT OF THE COTTAGE AND THE OLD WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM TO THE GATE WATCHING HIM SADLY WITH HER SHAKING HEAD AS HE ALMOST RAN TOWARDS THE TOWN
AND WHERE DOUBT ENTERS THERE IS NOT PERFECT LOVE
JOYLESS IS THE DAY'S RETURN TILL THY MERCY'S BEAMS I SEE
I WANT VERY STRONG SPECTACLES TO READ WITH BUT THEN I THINK MY EYES GET BETTER AND BETTER FOR THINGS AT A DISTANCE
TOMMY MY LAD TAKE CARE YOU'RE NOT SHOT FOR A LITTLE THIEVING BIRD SAID ADAM AS HE WALKED ON TOWARDS THE CURRANT-TREES
I'M QUITE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE SAID
HE REALLY SUSPECTED THAT ARTHUR WANTED TO TELL HIM SOMETHING AND THOUGHT OF SMOOTHING THE WAY FOR HIM BY THIS DIRECT QUESTION
THEN WHOEVER GETS TH HONOUR THERE'LL BE NO ENVYING ON HIM EH HERE'S MESTER MASSEY SAID MR CRAIG WHO BEING A NEUTRAL IN THE DISPUTE HAD NO INTEREST BUT IN CONCILIATION
HAPPEN YE'D GET SOMETHING TO THINK ON YOURSELF THEN INSTEAD O THOSE WICKED SONGS YOU'RE SO FOND ON
IF HE HADN'T HAD SO MUCH HARD WORK TO DO POOR FELLOW HE MIGHT HAVE GONE INTO THE HIGHER BRANCHES AND THEN THIS MIGHT NEVER HAVE HAPPENED--MIGHT NEVER HAVE HAPPENED BARTLE WAS HEATED BY THE EXERTION OF WALKING FAST IN AN AGITATED FRAME OF MIND AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CHECK HIMSELF ON THIS FIRST OCCASION OF VENTING HIS FEELINGS
BUT TOTTY SPENT NO TIME IN USELESS REGRETS AND SHE WAS ALREADY SUCKING THE THIRD JUICIEST WHEN ADAM SAID THERE NOW TOTTY YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHERRIES
BUT HETTY'S GOT AS GOOD A CHANCE O GETTING A SOLID SOBER HUSBAND AS ANY GELL I THIS COUNTRY AFTER THROWING OUT THIS PREGNANT HINT MR POYSER RECURRED TO HIS PIPE AND HIS SILENCE LOOKING AT HETTY TO SEE IF SHE DID NOT GIVE SOME SIGN OF HAVING RENOUNCED HER ILL-ADVISED WISH
IT'S WONDERFUL HE THOUGHT HOW THAT SOUND GOES TO ONE'S HEART ALMOST LIKE A FUNERAL BELL FOR ALL IT TELLS ONE O THE JOYFULLEST TIME O THE YEAR AND THE TIME WHEN MEN ARE MOSTLY THE THANKFULLEST
THE OLD MAN MUST GIVE UP HIS BUSINESS SOMETIME AND HE HAS NO SON
MAKE HER FEEL THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING GOD WHO BEHOLDS ALL THE PAST TO WHOM THE DARKNESS IS AS NOONDAY
THE SCENE HAD QUITE CHANGED IN THE HALF-HOUR THAT ADAM HAD BEEN IN THE GARDEN
AS CLEAN AS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THAT WONDERFUL HOUSE-PLACE WHERE THE ONLY CHANCE OF COLLECTING A FEW GRAINS OF DUST WOULD BE TO CLIMB ON THE SALT-COFFER AND PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE HIGH MANTEL-SHELF ON WHICH THE GLITTERING BRASS CANDLESTICKS ARE ENJOYING THEIR SUMMER SINECURE
HE ALWAYS THATCHED THE RICKS--FOR IF ANYTHING WERE HIS FORTE MORE THAN ANOTHER IT WAS THATCHING--AND WHEN THE LAST TOUCH HAD BEEN PUT TO THE LAST BEEHIVE RICK KESTER WHOSE HOME LAY AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE FARM WOULD TAKE A WALK TO THE RICK-YARD IN HIS BEST CLOTHES ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND STAND IN THE LANE AT A DUE DISTANCE TO CONTEMPLATE HIS OWN THATCHING WALKING ABOUT TO GET EACH RICK FROM THE PROPER POINT OF VIEW
DINAH HAD NEVER BEEN MORE CONSTANTLY PRESENT WITH HIM THAN IN THIS SCENE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS SO UNLIKE HER
THE STRONGEST CALF MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO SUCK AT
THE LOCKET LEAPED OUT FROM HER FROCK AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE STRING WAS BROKEN AND HETTY HELPLESS SAW BEADS AND LOCKET SCATTERED WIDE ON THE FLOOR
SOMETHING THAT WILL SURPRISE YOU HE CONTINUED AS THEY SAT DOWN
BUT FOR THE MATTER O THAT IF EVERYBODY WAS TO DO LIKE YOU THE WORLD MUST COME TO A STANDSTILL
PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER-NAILS--IN THIS ROUGH MAN WHO KNEW NO BETTER LYRICS THAN HE COULD FIND IN THE OLD AND NEW VERSION AND AN OCCASIONAL HYMN
THIS EVENING HE HAD HIS HABITUAL AIR OF DREAMY BENIGNANT CONTENTMENT UNTIL HE CAME QUITE CLOSE TO DINAH AND SAW THE TRACES OF TEARS ON HER DELICATE EYELIDS AND EYELASHES
AN SO I JUST AXED YE
GOD REQUIRES BOTH TASKS AT OUR HANDS
YET THERE WAS TRUTH IN WHAT ADAM SAID--THAT IT WOULD SAVE HER FROM A LENGTHENED DELUSION WHICH MIGHT BE WORSE THAN A SHARP IMMEDIATE PAIN
WHERE THAT GOOD SHOEMAKER GOT HIS NOTION OF READING FROM REMAINED A MYSTERY EVEN TO HIS MOST INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES
IF I WASN'T SHARP WITH HIM HE'D SELL EVERY BIT O STUFF I TH YARD AND SPEND IT ON DRINK
IF THEY WENT TO QUITE INDIFFERENT TOPICS HIS DIFFICULTY WOULD BE HEIGHTENED
THE FARMER HAVING A LATENT SENSE OF CAPITAL AND OF WEIGHT IN PARISH AFFAIRS WHICH SUSTAINED HIM UNDER HIS CONSPICUOUS INFERIORITY IN CONVERSATION
HETTY WENT CLOSE TO THE ROCKING-CHAIR AND STOOD WITHOUT HER USUAL SMILE AND WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO ENTICE TOTTY SIMPLY WAITING FOR HER AUNT TO GIVE THE CHILD INTO HER HANDS
THEE MUSTNA SAY SO
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU TO STAY--SIT DOWN ADAM SAT DOWN AND THEY REMAINED OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER IN UNEASY SILENCE WHILE ARTHUR SLOWLY DRANK BRANDY-AND-WATER WITH VISIBLY RENOVATING EFFECT
BUT THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT IS--I'LL HAVE NOBODY IN MY NIGHT-SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T STRIVE TO LEARN WHAT HE COMES TO LEARN AS HARD AS IF HE WAS STRIVING TO GET OUT OF A DARK HOLE INTO BROAD DAYLIGHT
YOU PERCEIVE THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WAS A GOOD FELLOW"--ALL HIS COLLEGE FRIENDS THOUGHT HIM SUCH
ON THE TABLE AT MR IRWINE'S ELBOW LAY THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE FOULIS AESCHYLUS WHICH ARTHUR KNEW WELL BY SIGHT
IT WAS A BUSY DAY WITH ADAM WHO OF LATE HAD DONE ALMOST DOUBLE WORK FOR HE WAS CONTINUING TO ACT AS FOREMAN FOR JONATHAN BURGE UNTIL SOME SATISFACTORY PERSON COULD BE FOUND TO SUPPLY HIS PLACE AND JONATHAN WAS SLOW TO FIND THAT PERSON
HE COULD BE CONTENT WITH VERY LITTLE AT PRESENT
AT LAST HETTY BURST OUT WITH A SOB DINAH DO YOU THINK GOD WILL TAKE AWAY THAT CRYING AND THE PLACE IN THE WOOD NOW I'VE TOLD EVERYTHING LET US PRAY POOR SINNER
HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SOOTHE HER WITH TENDER HOPEFUL WORDS LEST HE SHOULD THROW HER INTO VIOLENT DISTRESS
AND HE COULD GLANCE AT HER CONTINUALLY AS SHE BENT OVER THE FRUIT WHILE THE LEVEL EVENING SUNBEAMS STOLE THROUGH THE THICK APPLE-TREE BOUGHS AND RESTED ON HER ROUND CHEEK AND NECK AS IF THEY TOO WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
THERE'S PLENTY O NICE PARTNERS TO PICK AN CHOOSE FROM AN IT'S HARD FOR THE GELLS WHEN THE MEN STAN BY AND DON'T ASK EM ADAM FELT THE JUSTICE OF MR POYSER'S OBSERVATION
AND I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP FOR A GOOD WHILE FOR WHEN I WOKE IT WAS MORNING BUT NOT VERY LIGHT AND THE BABY WAS CRYING
SHE GROPED HER WAY TOUCHING THE PRICKLY GORSE TO THE DOOR AND PUSHED IT OPEN
THERE'S MANY A GOOD BIT O WORK DONE WITH A BAD HEART
BUT HE ONLY SHIVERED AGAIN AND SAID NOTHING
DO NOT REASON ABOUT IT MY PHILOSPHICAL READER AND SAY THAT HETTY BEING VERY PRETTY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHETHER SHE HAD ON ANY ORNAMENTS OR NOT
HETTY ONCE MORE IN HER OWN DRESS WITH HER NECKERCHIEF PUSHED A LITTLE BACKWARDS ON THIS WARM EVENING WAS SEATED PICKING CURRANTS NEAR THE WINDOW WHERE ADAM COULD SEE HER QUITE WELL
BUT INSTEAD OF TAKING THE DIRECT ROAD HE CHOSE TO TURN BACK ALONG THE FIELDS THROUGH WHICH HE AND DINAH HAD ALREADY PASSED
DIDN'T I SEE HER YESTERDAY
I DOUBT HE'S GOT TO TH WAGGIN OVERTHROW AGAIN A DEEP FLUSH OF ANGER PASSED RAPIDLY OVER ADAM'S FACE
VIGOROUS REPAIRS SHOULD GO ON EVERYWHERE AMONG FARM-BUILDINGS AND COTTAGES AND TRAVELLERS IN POST-CHAISES COMING ALONG THE ROSSETER ROAD SHOULD DO NOTHING BUT ADMIRE AS THEY WENT
ADAM WAS NOT INCLINED TO ENTER INTO THE SUBTLETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE BUT HE WAS INCLINED TO INTERCHANGE A WORD OR TWO OF BROTHERLY AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE WITH SETH
DON'T SHUT GOD'S LOVE OUT IN THAT WAY BY CLINGING TO SIN....HE CAN'T BLESS YOU WHILE YOU HAVE ONE FALSEHOOD IN YOUR SOUL
I FEEL SURE ALICK MEANT NO IRREVERENCE
EH MY LAD HE WENT AFF TO TREDDLES'ON THIS FORENOON AN'S NIVER COME BACK
POYSER IS NOT AT HOME IS HE SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY-DOOR
IT'S NO USE SIR HE SAID TO THE RECTOR IT'S NO USE FOR ME TO GO BACK
SEND YOUR BOY HOWEVER TO SAY THEY SHALL HAVE THE GRAVE LEST ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO DETAIN ME
AND I MADE HASTE OUT OF THE WOOD BUT I COULD HEAR IT CRYING ALL THE WHILE
THE MONTHS WOULD BE SHORT WITH ALL HE HAD TO FILL HIS MIND AND THIS FOOLISH EAGERNESS WHICH HAD COME OVER HIM OF LATE MUST NOT HURRY HIM INTO ANY PREMATURE WORDS
HE'S HELPED ME TO KNOWLEDGE I COULD NEVER HA GOT BY MYSELF WHAT A RARE FELLOW YOU ARE ADAM SAID ARTHUR AFTER A PAUSE IN WHICH HE HAD LOOKED MUSINGLY AT THE BIG FELLOW WALKING BY HIS SIDE
SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD CRY IF HE GAVE HER NO SIGN OF FEELING
THE PORRIDGE WILL BE AWK'ARD NOW AND THEN
I HOPE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET AWAY TO THE REGIMENT THOUGH IN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST
THE COVERED CART WITHOUT SPRINGS WAS STANDING READY TO CARRY THE WHOLE FAMILY EXCEPT THE MEN-SERVANTS
I BESEECH YOU TO IMAGINE MR IRWINE LOOKING ROUND ON THIS SCENE IN HIS AMPLE WHITE SURPLICE THAT BECAME HIM SO WELL WITH HIS POWDERED HAIR THROWN BACK HIS RICH BROWN COMPLEXION AND HIS FINELY CUT NOSTRIL AND UPPER LIP
AND SHE MUST PUT OFF FINDING THE POOL TILL TO-MORROW AND MAKE HER WAY TO SOME SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT
SOON THEY WERE ALL SEATED--THE TWO ROSY LADS ONE ON EACH SIDE BY THE PALE MOTHER A PLACE BEING LEFT FOR HETTY BETWEEN ADAM AND HER UNCLE
I STOOD AND LOOKED BACK AFTER HER BUT SHE WENT RIGHT ON WHILE SHE WAS IN SIGHT
THE FINE OLD REMNANT STOOD A LITTLE BACKWARD AND UNDER THE SHADOW OF TALL BEECHES BUT THE SUN WAS NOW ON THE TALLER AND MORE ADVANCED FRONT THE BLINDS WERE ALL DOWN AND THE HOUSE SEEMED ASLEEP IN THE HOT MIDDAY
SO OPEN-LOOKING AND CANDID TOO
I FOUND HIM I THE SHOP THIS FORENOON ARTER THEE WAST GONE A-SITTIN AN DOIN NOTHIN'--NOT SO MUCH AS A BOOKE AFORE HIM HE'S A DEAL O WORK UPON HIM JUST NOW MOTHER SAID SETH AND I THINK HE'S A BIT TROUBLED IN HIS MIND
YOU'RE OUT THERE
FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THIS REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT THE SELECT NATURES WHO PANT AFTER THE IDEAL AND FIND NOTHING IN PANTALOONS OR PETTICOATS GREAT ENOUGH TO COMMAND THEIR REVERENCE AND LOVE ARE CURIOUSLY IN UNISON WITH THE NARROWEST AND PETTIEST
IT HAS LONG BEEN MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS ON THE ESTATE WHICH HAPPEN TO BE VERY VALUABLE NOT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK SO HIGHLY OF HIS CHARACTER BUT BECAUSE HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE SKILL WHICH FIT HIM FOR THE PLACE
AND THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING OVERSPERITIAL
GIVE HIM A GUINEA AND NO MORE WELL MISS LYDDY I RECKON BELIEVED WHAT HE TOLD HER AND SHE'S NOT OVERFOND O PARTING WITH THE MONEY HERSELF--SHE'S NOT A BAD WOMAN AT BOTTOM BUT SHE'S BEEN BROUGHT UP UNDER HIS THUMB
IN YOUNG CHILDISH IGNORANT SOULS THERE IS CONSTANTLY THIS BLIND TRUST IN SOME UNSHAPEN CHANCE
BUT HOWEVER STRONG A MAN'S RESOLUTION MAY BE IT COSTS HIM SOMETHING TO CARRY IT OUT NOW AND THEN
THEE MIGHTST AS WELL LIKE HER T HA THY BROTHER SETH WAS HURT
I'LL BE BOND FOR HIM ANY DAY AS HE'LL BE A GOOD SON TO THE LAST
I WASN'T BUTLER FIFTEEN YEAR WITHOUT LEARNING THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS ABOUT DINNER NAY NAY SAID OLD MARTIN I'N GI'EN UP TO MY SON
BUT I'LL NOT TURN MY BACK ON HER
AND SHE HAD THE WHOLE EVENING TO TALK WITH DINAH ALONE
IF ANYBODY BESIDES ME KNEW WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOUR MEETING A GENTLEMAN AND HAVING FINE PRESENTS FROM HIM THEY'D SPEAK LIGHT ON YOU AND YOU'D LOSE YOUR CHARACTER
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE FACES THAT MAKE ONE THINK OF WHITE FLOWERS WITH LIGHT TOUCHES OF COLOUR ON THEIR PURE PETALS
TOMMY I'LL SEND YOU TO BED THIS MINUTE IF YOU DON'T GIVE OVER LAUGHING
I'VE KEPT THE TREDDLESTON PEOPLE AWAY BY HAVING A FEAST FOR THEM IN THE TOWN
NAY WORSE
BUT THIS DAY SHE WAS FORTUNATE FOR SHE WAS SOON OVERTAKEN BY A CARRIER'S CART WHICH CARRIED HER TO HINCKLEY AND BY THE HELP OF A RETURN CHAISE WITH A DRUNKEN POSTILION--WHO FRIGHTENED HER BY DRIVING LIKE JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI AND SHOUTING HILARIOUS REMARKS AT HER TWISTING HIMSELF BACKWARDS ON HIS SADDLE--SHE WAS BEFORE NIGHT IN THE HEART OF WOODY WARWICKSHIRE
THIS IS NOT WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY
THE HUSBAND THOUGHT IF THE ORNAMENTS WERE NOT REDEEMED HE COULD MAKE A GOOD THING OF IT BY TAKING THEM TO LONDON AND SELLING THEM
AND I HAVE SOME PRIDE AS WELL AS PLEASURE IN ASSURING YOU THAT I SHARE YOUR HIGH HOPES CONCERNING HIM AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSSESSION OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH WILL MAKE HIM AN EXCELLENT LANDLORD WHEN THE TIME SHALL COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT POSITION AMONG YOU
MEN'S MUSCLES MOVE BETTER WHEN THEIR SOULS ARE MAKING MERRY MUSIC THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS
IT'S THE SAME WITH THE NOTIONS IN RELIGION AS IT IS WITH MATH'MATICS--A MAN MAY BE ABLE TO WORK PROBLEMS STRAIGHT OFF IN'S HEAD AS HE SITS BY THE FIRE AND SMOKES HIS PIPE BUT IF HE HAS TO MAKE A MACHINE OR A BUILDING HE MUST HAVE A WILL AND A RESOLUTION AND LOVE SOMETHING ELSE BETTER THAN HIS OWN EASE
I'VE HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO
AND THEN THE BUTTER ITSELF SEEMS TO COMMUNICATE A FRESH CHARM--IT IS SO PURE SO SWEET-SCENTED
THEY WILL RATHER BE LIKE THOSE LITTLE WORDS LIGHT AND MUSIC STIRRING THE LONG-WINDING FIBRES OF YOUR MEMORY AND ENRICHING YOUR PRESENT WITH YOUR MOST PRECIOUS PAST
I SEE HIS WOUNDED BODY AND HIS LOOK OF LOVE HERE DINAH TURNED TO BESSY CRANAGE WHOSE BONNY YOUTH AND EVIDENT VANITY HAD TOUCHED HER WITH PITY
IT WAS THE ONLY MEANS THAT PROMISED A SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY
I'D HAVE YOU JUST AS YOU ARE NOW WITHOUT ANYTHING T INTERFERE WITH YOUR OWN LOOKS
ADAM WAS TOO HEART-SICK TO TAKE NOTICE OF GYP'S FONDLING
IT WAS NOTHING TO HER PUTTING HER ARM THROUGH ADAM'S BUT SHE KNEW HE CARED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HAVING HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND SHE WISHED HIM TO CARE
WHEN BARTLE RE-ENTERED HOWEVER THERE APPEARED TO BE A GENERAL DESIRE FOR SOLO MUSIC AFTER THE CHORAL
BUT YOU WILL PROMISE ME TWO DANCES WON'T YOU THE CAPTAIN CONTINUED DETERMINED TO MAKE HETTY LOOK AT HIM AND SPEAK TO HIM
I CAN BE THERE AND BACK PRETTY SOON
YOU'VE NIVER DINED HERE BEFORE AS I REMEMBER NO MR CASSON SAID ADAM IN HIS STRONG VOICE THAT COULD BE HEARD ALONG THE TABLE
IT IS A MARRIAGE SUCH AS THEY MADE IN THE GOLDEN AGE WHEN THE MEN WERE ALL WISE AND MAJESTIC AND THE WOMEN ALL LOVELY AND LOVING
ALL HIS JEALOUSY AND SENSE OF PERSONAL INJURY WHICH HE HAD BEEN HITHERTO TRYING TO KEEP UNDER HAD LEAPED UP AND MASTERED HIM
THE TEMPTATION WOULD VANISH AS THE CHARM OF FOND WORDS VANISHES WHEN ONE REPEATS THEM TO THE INDIFFERENT
TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW--TAKE NO THOUGHT--THAT'S WHAT THEE'T ALLAYS SAYIN
SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPRESSION A MAN MAKES ON YOU WHEN YOU WALK BY HIS SIDE IN FAMILIAR TALK OR LOOK AT HIM IN HIS HOME AND THE FIGURE HE MAKES WHEN SEEN FROM A LOFTY HISTORICAL LEVEL OR EVEN IN THE EYES OF A CRITICAL NEIGHBOUR WHO THINKS OF HIM AS AN EMBODIED SYSTEM OR OPINION RATHER THAN AS A MAN
IT WAS BORNE IN UPON MY MIND WHILE I WAS MEDITATING ON SUNDAY NIGHT AS SISTER ALLEN WHO'S IN A DECLINE IS IN NEED OF ME
THE EVENING HYMN WHICH ALWAYS OPENED THE SERVICE HAD BEGUN AND EVERY ONE MUST NOW ENTER AND TAKE HIS PLACE
UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGHTS MUST BE GOT RID OF BY GOOD INTENTIONS FOR THE FUTURE WHICH CAN BE FORMED SO RAPIDLY THAT HE HAD TIME TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE AND TO BECOME EASY AGAIN BEFORE MR POYSER'S SLOW SPEECH WAS FINISHED AND WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO SPEAK HE WAS QUITE LIGHT-HEARTED
THERE WAS ALMOST A SWEET SADNESS ABOUT HER
THERE'S VERY LITTLE BRANDY IN IT SIR HE SAID TURNING IT DOWNWARDS OVER THE GLASS AS HE HELD IT BEFORE THE WINDOW
I'VE HAD MY SUPPER MR MASSEY SAID ADAM SO I'LL LOOK ON WHILE YOU EAT YOURS
THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MRS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT AND NOT BY OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULT
I'VE A LITTLE MATTER TO ATTEND TO ARTHUR CONTINUED MR IRWINE RISING TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND THEN I SHALL BE READY TO SET OUT WITH YOU THE LITTLE MATTER THAT MR IRWINE HAD TO ATTEND TO TOOK HIM UP THE OLD STONE STAIRCASE PART OF THE HOUSE WAS VERY OLD AND MADE HIM PAUSE BEFORE A DOOR AT WHICH HE KNOCKED GENTLY
BUT NOW DEAR FRIEND DRINK THIS OTHER CUP OF TEA AND EAT A LITTLE MORE WHAT SAID LISBETH TAKING THE CUP AND SPEAKING IN A LESS QUERULOUS TONE HAD YE GOT NO FEYTHER AND MOTHER THEN AS YE WAR SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR AUNT NO I NEVER KNEW A FATHER OR MOTHER
I'VE OFTEN HEARD DINAH TALK OF HER BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT NAME SHE CALLED HER BY
WELL I'VE NO OBJECTIONS TO ADVANCE YOU THREE GUINEAS SAID THE LANDLORD
COME LORD AND GATHER OF THE FRUITS OF THY TRAVAIL AND THY PLEADING
I THINK AS MR IRWINE LOOKED ROUND TO-DAY HIS EYES RESTED AN INSTANT LONGER THAN USUAL ON THE SQUARE PEW OCCUPIED BY MARTIN POYSER AND HIS FAMILY
I SHOULD HAVE NO NEED TO PERSUADE HER
BUT I HAVE NOT FAITH THAT IT WOULD BE SO WITH ME FOR SINCE MY AFFECTIONS HAVE BEEN SET ABOVE MEASURE ON YOU I HAVE HAD LESS PEACE AND JOY IN GOD
SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN AS IS A-GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY
IT COMES OUT OF A BOOK AS ADAM PICKED UP AT THE STALL AT TREDDLES'ON
IT WAS RIDING IN THAT BREAK-NECK WAY
FOR IF DONKEYS SET TO WORK TO SING YOU'RE PRETTY SURE WHAT THE TUNE'LL BE WHY DID THEY TALK IT OVER BEFORE MR BURGE SAID ADAM
AND YOU'D NO CALL TO SAY THAT LOOKING INDIGNANTLY AT HER HUSBAND
SHE HAD SEEN WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEE
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN HER PALENESS AND AGITATION WITH HER DARK CHILDISH EYES DILATED AND HER BREATH SHORTER THAN USUAL
AYE AYE SAID ADAM STRIDING ALONG TOWARDS THE STREAK OF PALE ROAD
BUT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SOLVE SUCH RIDDLES ANY MORE THAN SHE CARED TO KNOW WHAT WAS MEANT BY THE PICTURES IN THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS OR IN THE OLD FOLIO BIBLE THAT MARTY AND TOMMY ALWAYS PLAGUED HER ABOUT ON A SUNDAY
THE OTHER PUPILS HAD HAPPILY ONLY THEIR WRITING-BOOKS TO SHOW IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PROGRESS FROM POT-HOOKS TO ROUND TEXT
HIS EYES GOT DIM AS HE LOOKED AT HER
WE OWE HER SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THAT AS IT OFTEN HAPPENS THE WORDS INTENDED TO RELIEVE HER WERE JUST TOO MUCH FOR DINAH'S SUSCEPTIBLE FEELINGS AT THIS MOMENT
WHILE LISBETH AUTOMATICALLY OBEYING HER OLD HABITS BEGAN TO PUT AWAY THE BREAKFAST THINGS AS IF SHE DID NOT MEAN DINAH TO TAKE HER PLACE ANY LONGER
IT HAS NO FEAR OF DOGS BUT MAY CLIMB OVER WALLS AND PEEP IN AT WINDOWS WITH IMPUNITY
GOD HELP THE LAD AND ME TOO HE THOUGHT AS HE LIFTED THE BOARD
HAS YOUR GRANDFATHER YIELDED ON THE OTHER POINT TOO AND AGREED TO HAVE A RESPECTABLE MAN AS STEWARD OH NO SAID ARTHUR RISING FROM HIS CHAIR WITH AN AIR OF IMPATIENCE AND WALKING ALONG THE ROOM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS
YOU SEE GYP BIDS YOU WELCOME SAID ADAM AND HE'S VERY SLOW TO WELCOME STRANGERS POOR DOG SAID DINAH PATTING THE ROUGH GREY COAT I'VE A STRANGE FEELING ABOUT THE DUMB THINGS AS IF THEY WANTED TO SPEAK AND IT WAS A TROUBLE TO EM BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T
YE MIGHT GET RELIGION AND THAT UD BE THE BEST DAY'S EARNINGS Y EVER MADE ALL I GOOD TIME FOR THAT SETH
I CAN'T STOP
MY HEART WENT LIKE A STONE
SHE WAS NOT BLIND TO THE FACT THAT YOUNG LUKE BRITTON OF BROXTON CAME TO HAYSLOPE CHURCH ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON ON PURPOSE THAT HE MIGHT SEE HER
WHY HETTY LASS ARE YE TURNED METHODIST SAID MR POYSER WITH THAT COMFORTABLE SLOW ENJOYMENT OF A LAUGH WHICH ONE ONLY SEES IN STOUT PEOPLE
BUT WHEN HE ENTERED THE STUDY AND LOOKED IN MR IRWINE'S FACE HE FELT IN AN INSTANT THAT THERE WAS A NEW EXPRESSION IN IT STRANGELY DIFFERENT FROM THE WARM FRIENDLINESS IT HAD ALWAYS WORN FOR HIM BEFORE
NO WORD SEEMED TO ARREST HER EAR
AND THERE IS A HEAVIER SORROW COMING UPON YOU THAN ANY YOU HAVE YET KNOWN
IT'S A FEARFUL THING HURRYING HER SOUL AWAY SO FAST BUT LET WHAT WILL BE SHE ADDED PRESENTLY
IT WAS A LONELY DEATH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY THAT HIS GRIEF WAS DEEPER THAN THAT
MY MOTHER WON'T STAND IN THE WAY FOR SHE'S TOLD ME SINCE I CAME HOME SHE'D MADE UP HER MIND TO BEING BURIED IN ANOTHER PARISH IF I WISHED IT AND IF I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE ELSEWHERE
FOR ARTHUR WAS AT EASE ABOUT HETTY--NOT QUITE AT EASE ABOUT THE PAST FOR A CERTAIN BURNING OF THE EARS WOULD COME WHENEVER HE THOUGHT OF THE SCENES WITH ADAM LAST AUGUST BUT AT EASE ABOUT HER PRESENT LOT
THEE'T IN TROUBLE SETH'S EYES WERE RED AND THERE WAS A LOOK OF DEEP DEPRESSION ON HIS MILD FACE
SETH LAD HE SAID THE CAPTAIN HAS SENT TO SAY I'M TO DINE UPSTAIRS--HE WISHES IT PARTICULAR MR MILLS SAYS SO I SUPPOSE IT UD BE BEHAVING ILL FOR ME NOT TO GO
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER BEEN HARE-BRAINED AND LIGHT-HEARTED LIKE OTHER YOUNGSTERS
THE COTTAGE WAS FAR FROM THAT STANDARD AT PRESENT FOR LISBETH'S RHEUMATISM HAD FORCED HER TO GIVE UP HER OLD HABITS OF DILETTANTE SCOURING AND POLISHING
YOU THINK LITTLE O DOING WHAT MAY DAMAGE OTHER FOLKS SO AS YOU GET YOUR BIT O TRIFLING AS MEANS NOTHING
SIT YE DOWN
SIT YE DOWN
BUT I SEE PLAIN ENOUGH WE SHALL NEVER DO IT WITHOUT A RESOLUTION AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME ADAM YOU PERCEIVE WAS A WARM ADMIRER PERHAPS A PARTIAL JUDGE OF MR IRWINE AS HAPPILY SOME OF US STILL ARE OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KNOWN FAMILIARLY
WHILE HIS MUSCLES WERE WORKING LUSTILY HIS MIND SEEMED AS PASSIVE AS A SPECTATOR AT A DIORAMA
ANGERED
HAPPEN SHE'LL GO TO DINAH DINAH HAVING TAKEN OFF HER BONNET AND SHAWL HAD HITHERTO KEPT QUIETLY SEATED IN THE BACKGROUND NOT LIKING TO THRUST HERSELF BETWEEN HETTY AND WHAT WAS CONSIDERED HETTY'S PROPER WORK
NANCY DECLARED THAT TIM THE WAGGONER KNEW A SONG AND WAS ALLAYS SINGING LIKE A LARK I THE STABLE WHEREUPON MR POYSER SAID ENCOURAGINGLY COME TIM LAD LET'S HEAR IT TIM LOOKED SHEEPISH TUCKED DOWN HIS HEAD AND SAID HE COULDN'T SING BUT THIS ENCOURAGING INVITATION OF THE MASTER'S WAS ECHOED ALL ROUND THE TABLE
AS FOR ANY REAL HARM IN HETTY'S CASE IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
HE FELT SURE THEY WOULD NEVER RETURN
SETH HOWEVER HAD ONLY JUST AWAKENED AT THE SOUND OF THE OPENING DOOR
HE IS THERE CLOSE TO YOU NOW
HE SOMEHOW FELT THAT THE SOUND OF HIS OWN RUDE VOICE WOULD BE GRATING JUST THEN
NAY BUT HE AFTEN GOES TO TH COMMON
THERE'S NO PLEASURE I LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL
THE SWEET TIME OF EARLY GROWTH AND VAGUE HOPES IS PAST
SHE TREMBLED AND DARED NOT LOOK
THE NIGHT WAS VERY STILL
AND SHE'S ALLAYS SEEMED CLEAR ABOUT THAT--AS HER WORK WAS TO MINISTER T OTHERS AND MAKE NO HOME FOR HERSELF I THIS WORLD BUT SUPPOSE SAID ADAM EARNESTLY SUPPOSE THERE WAS A MAN AS UD LET HER DO JUST THE SAME AND NOT INTERFERE WITH HER--SHE MIGHT DO A GOOD DEAL O WHAT SHE DOES NOW JUST AS WELL WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED AS WHEN SHE WAS SINGLE
HE'S FULL O THIS PEACE NOW AS THEY TALK ON
IRWINE WOULD THINK HIM A SHILLY-SHALLY FELLOW EVER AFTER
SITTING UP TILL PAST TWELVE TO DO EXTRY WORK
AT THE THOUGHT OF ALL THIS SPLENDOUR HETTY GOT UP FROM HER CHAIR AND IN DOING SO CAUGHT THE LITTLE RED-FRAMED GLASS WITH THE EDGE OF HER SCARF SO THAT IT FELL WITH A BANG ON THE FLOOR
HE LOOSED THE PLANK AND WENT TO THE KITCHEN DOOR
THEE WAST ALLAYS LIKE A BAG O MEAL AS CAN NE'ER BE BRUISED--THOUGH FOR THE MATTER O THAT THY POOR FEYTHER WAR JUST SUCH ANOTHER
IT WAS THEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER LOCKET AND EAR-RINGS AND SEEING HER POCKET LIE NEAR SHE REACHED IT AND SPREAD THE CONTENTS ON THE BED BEFORE HER
AN THEY'D HA COME THEIRSELVES TO ASK YOU BUT THEY'VE SO MUCH TO SEE AFTER WITH THE CROWNER AN THAT
AND IT'S WRONG ON US TO GIVE WAY TO GRIEF MRS BEDE
SHE THINKS IT UD BE A FINER LIFE THAN BEING WI THEM AS ARE AKIN TO HER AND HA BROUGHT HER UP SIN SHE WAR NO BIGGER NOR MARTY
HE KEPT THEM IN HIS MEMORY AS A PAINTER DOES WITH ALL THE FLECKS AND KNOTS IN THEIR BARK ALL THE CURVES AND ANGLES OF THEIR BOUGHS AND HAD OFTEN CALCULATED THE HEIGHT AND CONTENTS OF A TRUNK TO A NICETY AS HE STOOD LOOKING AT IT
WE CAN NEVER RECALL THE JOY WITH WHICH WE LAID OUR HEADS ON OUR MOTHER'S BOSOM OR RODE ON OUR FATHER'S BACK IN CHILDHOOD
HE COULD NOT SPEAK IN THE FIRST MOMENT AFTER SEEING THAT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY
MRS POYSER TOO MET HER HUSBAND'S OCCASIONAL FOREBODINGS OF A NOTICE TO QUIT WITH THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE LADY DAY"--ONE OF THOSE UNDENIABLE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH ARE USUALLY INTENDED TO CONVEY A PARTICULAR MEANING VERY FAR FROM UNDENIABLE
HE FELT NO IMPULSE THAT HE NEEDED TO RESIST
SETH IS A GRACIOUS YOUNG MAN--SINCERE AND WITHOUT OFFENCE
ALICK TAKES IT ON HORSEBACK NO I'M SURE YOUR PRETTY ARMS WERE NEVER MEANT FOR SUCH HEAVY WEIGHTS
HE KNEW THAT THE RECTOR ALWAYS BREAKFASTED IN HIS STUDY AND THE STUDY LAY ON THE LEFT HAND OF THIS DOOR OPPOSITE THE DINING-ROOM
AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP FROM IT THERE WAS THE REFLECTION OF A BLANCHED FACE IN THE OLD DIM GLASS--A WHITE MARBLE FACE WITH ROUNDED CHILDISH FORMS BUT WITH SOMETHING SADDER THAN A CHILD'S PAIN IN IT
BUT HIS ANGER WAS SUBDUED BY THE SAME INFLUENCE THAT HAD SUBDUED ADAM'S WHEN THEY FIRST CONFRONTED EACH OTHER--BY THE MARKS OF SUFFERING IN A LONG FAMILIAR FACE
AND THEN NOTHING CAN STIR YOU--YOU LOOK LIKE THE STATTY O THE OUTSIDE O TREDDLES'ON CHURCH A-STARIN AND A-SMILIN WHETHER IT'S FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL
ARTHUR WENT ON PERHAPS YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING YOU'VE HAD BITTERLY TO REPENT OF IN YOUR LIFE ADAM
AND A MAN MAY HAVE TWO MINDS WHETHER IT ISN'T WORTHWHILE TO GET A BRUISE OR TWO FOR THE SAKE OF A BIT O FUN
THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST WAS ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN THE SUNSHINE LOOKED BRIGHTER IN ALL EYES FOR THE GLOOM THAT WENT BEFORE
SHE IS BEGINNING TO CRY
THEY SCARCELY EVER SPOKE TO ADAM
SETH ALWAYS TIMID IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS HIS MOTHER FROM THE SENSE THAT HE HAD NO INFLUENCE OVER HER FELT IT WAS USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE OR SOOTHE HER TILL THIS PASSION WAS PAST
IT IS AS IF SEMI-IDIOCY CAME TO GIVE US REST FROM THE MEMORY AND THE DREAD WHICH REFUSE TO LEAVE US IN OUR SLEEP
IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF THIS COUNTRY OF FLAT FIELDS AND HEDGEROWS AND DOTTED HOUSES AND VILLAGES AND MARKET-TOWNS--ALL SO MUCH ALIKE TO HER INDIFFERENT EYES--MUST HAVE NO END AND SHE MUST GO ON WANDERING AMONG THEM FOR EVER WAITING TIRED AT TOLL-GATES FOR SOME CART TO COME AND THEN FINDING THE CART WENT ONLY A LITTLE WAY--A VERY LITTLE WAY--TO THE MILLER'S A MILE OFF PERHAPS
GOD DIDN'T SEND ME TO YOU TO MAKE LIGHT OF YOUR SORROW BUT TO MOURN WITH YOU IF YOU WILL LET ME
SHE MIGHT HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND
BUT IF IT WAS ANYTHING UNREASONABLE THEY WANTED YOU TO DO LIKE TAKING YOUR CLOAK OFF AND GIVING IT TO EM OR LETTING EM SLAP YOU I THE FACE I DARESAY YOU'D BE READY ENOUGH
AND I WAS UNCOMMON PLEASED WITH IT WHEN IT WAS DONE
NAY SAID DINAH LOOKING UP WITH TIMID EYES NOT SO
AND HIS SAVINGS HAD BEEN SO CONSTANTLY DRAWN UPON BESIDES THE TERRIBLE SWEEP OF PAYING FOR SETH'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE MILITIA THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH MONEY BEFOREHAND TO FURNISH EVEN A SMALL COTTAGE AND KEEP SOMETHING IN RESERVE AGAINST A RAINY DAY
IT IS CERTAINLY RATHER AN UNFORTUNATE DAY THAT ALICK THE SHEPHERD HAS CHOSEN FOR HAVING THE WHITTAWS SINCE THE MORNING TURNED OUT SO WET
HE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER THAT WOULD SHELTER HER FROM DISCOVERY AND SCORN AMONG THE RELATIVES AND NEIGHBOURS WHO ONCE MORE MADE ALL HER WORLD NOW HER AIRY DREAM HAD VANISHED
AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL GONE THE OLD MAN LEANED ON THE GATE AGAIN WATCHING THEM ACROSS THE LANE ALONG THE HOME CLOSE AND THROUGH THE FAR GATE TILL THEY DISAPPEARED BEHIND A BEND IN THE HEDGE
THEE'DST HA LIKED IT TOO WOULDSTNA AH
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT IT'S TO LEAD TO WHEN A GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU KISSES AND MAKES LOVE TO A YOUNG WOMAN LIKE HETTY AND GIVES HER PRESENTS AS SHE'S FRIGHTENED FOR OTHER FOLKS TO SEE
AND LAST OF ALL A SMALL RED-FRAMED SHILLING LOOKING-GLASS WITHOUT BLOTCHES
BUT YOU MUSTN'T TAKE IT ILL OF ME NOT I LAD--NOT I SO THE NIGHT WORE ON IN AGITATION TILL THE CHILL DAWN AND THE GROWING LIGHT BROUGHT THE TREMULOUS QUIET THAT COMES ON THE BRINK OF DESPAIR
YOU KNOW ADAM WILL HAVE HIS WAY
I'M GOING INTO THE ARMY POOR ARTHUR FELT THAT ADAM OUGHT TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT--OUGHT TO HAVE A MOVEMENT OF SYMPATHY TOWARDS HIM
AND FOR WHOM THE MOTION AND SHAPE OF THE EARTH THE COURSE OF THE SUN AND THE CHANGES OF THE SEASONS LAY IN THE REGION OF MYSTERY JUST MADE VISIBLE BY FRAGMENTARY KNOWLEDGE
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK THE SAME WAY PRETTY NIGH AN HOUR AFTER I COULDN'T HELP LAYING DOWN MY STAKES TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK
AND THEN THE LOVE OF THE SAVIOUR WHO WAS WAITING AND WATCHING FOR THEIR RETURN
ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO TAKE WHAT SEEMED THE BEST COURSE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
I DON'T FEEL GOOD FOR MUCH--VERY LAZY AND NOT INCLINED TO MOVE
WE SHALL SEE YOU LIVING ON TH HILL BEFORE ANOTHER TWELVEMONT'S OVER WELL SAID ADAM I SHOULD LIKE T HAVE THE BUSINESS IN MY OWN HANDS
HOW COULD SHE BELIEVE IN ANY MISERY THAT COULD COME TO HER FROM THE FULFILMENT OF ALL SHE HAD BEEN LONGING FOR AND DREAMING OF
GUILTY IT WAS THE VERDICT EVERY ONE EXPECTED BUT THERE WAS A SIGH OF DISAPPOINTMENT FROM SOME HEARTS THAT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY NO RECOMMENDATION TO MERCY
AND WE'D STOCK HER WELL WI LINEN AND FEATHERS FOR I LOVE HER NEXT TO MY OWN CHILDREN
WHY WHAT'S UP IN YOUR PRETTY VILLAGE LANDLORD HE CONTINUED GETTING DOWN
OUR HEAVENLY FATHER COMFORT YOU AND STRENGTHEN YOU TO BEAR ALL THINGS DINAH PUT OUT HER HAND AND ADAM PRESSED IT IN SILENCE
HAPPY IN HIS INABILITY TO KNOW THE CAUSES OF THINGS PREFERRING THE THINGS THEMSELVES
I SHALL TAKE WHAT MEASURES I THINK PROPER NO SAID ADAM IN AN ABRUPT DECIDED TONE THAT WON'T DO
YOU NEEDN'T LOOK QUITE SO MUCH AT HETTY SORREL THEN
THEY HAD ALREADY GOT ON THEIR APRONS AND PAPER CAPS AND ADAM WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEFT HAND ON SETH'S SHOULDER WHILE HE POINTED WITH THE HAMMER IN HIS RIGHT TO SOME BOARDS WHICH THEY WERE LOOKING AT
I AM MISERABLE WHILE I SAY THIS BUT NOTHING ELSE CAN BE
I'LL SHOW IT YOU SOME OTHER TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT YES PLEASE SIR DO YOU ALWAYS COME BACK THIS WAY IN THE EVENING OR ARE YOU AFRAID TO COME SO LONELY A ROAD OH NO SIR IT'S NEVER LATE
AND SURELY IF THERE CAME A TRAVELLER TO THIS WORLD WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE STORY OF MAN'S LIFE UPON IT THIS IMAGE OF AGONY WOULD SEEM TO HIM STRANGELY OUT OF PLACE IN THE MIDST OF THIS JOYOUS NATURE
THEE'T NOT TAKE IT UNKIND I HOPE NAY NAY LAD SAID SETH THY HONOUR'S OUR HONOUR
BUT THE EXPRESSION OF DINAH'S EYES GRADUALLY RELIEVED HER
THE DELICATE-HANDED GENTLEMAN WAS A MATCH FOR THE WORKMAN IN EVERYTHING BUT STRENGTH AND ARTHUR'S SKILL ENABLED HIM TO PROTRACT THE STRUGGLE FOR SOME LONG MOMENTS
HE CONCEIVED NO PICTURE OF THE FUTURE BUT ONE MADE UP OF HARD-WORKING DAYS SUCH AS HE LIVED THROUGH WITH GROWING CONTENTMENT AND INTENSITY OF INTEREST EVERY FRESH WEEK
THEY WERE WORSE THAN THE NASTY LITTLE LAMBS THAT THE SHEPHERD WAS ALWAYS BRINGING IN TO BE TAKEN SPECIAL CARE OF IN LAMBING TIME
IT IS YOUR SINS THAT MADE THEM
IN THIS STATE OF MIND HOW COULD HETTY GIVE ANY FEELING TO ADAM'S TROUBLES OR THINK MUCH ABOUT POOR OLD THIAS BEING DROWNED
AND THERE'S A PARTING AT THE ROOT OF ALL OUR JOYS
AN WHAT COMES ON'T
THEE DOSTNA BELIEVE BUT WHAT THE DISSENTERS AND THE METHODISTS HAVE GOT THE ROOT O THE MATTER AS WELL AS THE CHURCH FOLKS NAY SETH LAD
I WILL NOT BE SO MUCH OF A TAILOR AS TO TROUBLE YOUR IMAGINATION WITH THE DIFFERENCE OF COSTUME AND INSIST ON THE STRIPED WAISTCOAT LONG-TAILED COAT AND LOW TOP-BOOTS
THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT YESTERDAY WHEN I SAID I'D BE CONTENT FOR YOU TO GO IF YOU THOUGHT RIGHT
HE WAS A METHODIST BRICKMAKER WHO AFTER SPENDING THIRTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN PERFECT SATISFACTION WITH HIS IGNORANCE HAD LATELY GOT RELIGION AND ALONG WITH IT THE DESIRE TO READ THE BIBLE
THE MOTHER'S BEGUN TO FIDGET ABOUT YOU AN SHE'S GOT THE LITTLE UN ILL
GOD BLESS HER FOR LOVING ME SAID ADAM AS HE WENT ON HIS WAY TO WORK AGAIN WITH GYP AT HIS HEELS
EVERY SAD LOOK OF HETTY'S SINCE SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO ADAM RETURNED UPON HIM NOW WITH ALL THE EXAGGERATION OF PAINFUL RETROSPECT
BUT SURELY THAT IS A NARROW THOUGHT
THAT HE ALWAYS PLACED HIMSELF AT CHURCH SO AS TO HAVE THE FULLEST VIEW OF HER BOTH SITTING AND STANDING
IT'S NO GOOD TALKING O WHAT CAN NEVER BE
ARTHUR HAD FELT A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE DURING MR POYSER'S SPEECH BUT IT WAS TOO FEEBLE TO NULLIFY THE PLEASURE HE FELT IN BEING PRAISED
AS IT WAS--HAVING WITH ALL HIS THREE LIVINGS NO MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED A-YEAR AND SEEING NO WAY OF KEEPING HIS SPLENDID MOTHER AND HIS SICKLY SISTER NOT TO RECKON A SECOND SISTER WHO WAS USUALLY SPOKEN OF WITHOUT ANY ADJECTIVE IN SUCH LADYLIKE EASE AS BECAME THEIR BIRTH AND HABITS AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING FOR A FAMILY OF HIS OWN--HE REMAINED YOU SEE AT THE AGE OF EIGHT-AND-FORTY A BACHELOR NOT MAKING ANY MERIT OF THAT RENUNCIATION BUT SAYING LAUGHINGLY IF ANY ONE ALLUDED TO IT THAT HE MADE IT AN EXCUSE FOR MANY INDULGENCES WHICH A WIFE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED HIM
I DARESAY IT'S A VERY UGLY CAP AND I USED TO THINK WHEN I SAW HER HERE AS IT WAS NONSENSE FOR HER TO DRESS DIFFERENT T OTHER PEOPLE
HAVING A LITERAL WAY OF INTERPRETING THE SCRIPTURES WHICH IS NOT AT ALL SANCTIONED BY APPROVED COMMENTATORS
LOOKS ULL MEND NO JUGS NOR LAUGHING NEITHER AS I SEE
AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING--WHEN THERE IS JUST A LINGERING HINT OF EARLY COOLNESS TO KEEP OFF LANGUOR UNDER THE DELICIOUS INFLUENCE OF WARMTH
HE DID NOT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY FOR HE HAD TO BE JUDICIOUS AND NOT TRUTHFUL
HE COULD NOT CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS
LET YOUR MOST FAULTY CHARACTERS ALWAYS BE ON THE WRONG SIDE AND YOUR VIRTUOUS ONES ON THE RIGHT
IT SWEPT AWAY THE VERY IDEAS THAT PRODUCED IT AND HETTY GOT UP TO REACH A WARM CLOAK FROM HER CLOTHES-PRESS WRAPPED IT ROUND HER AND SAT AS IF SHE WERE THINKING OF NOTHING BUT GETTING WARM
BUT THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST VISIT YOU WILL PAY YOUR AUNT--SO WE SHALL MEET AGAIN I HOPE HIS CORDIALITY TOWARDS DINAH SET ALL MRS POYSER'S ANXIETIES AT REST AND HER FACE WAS BRIGHTER THAN USUAL AS SHE SAID I'VE NEVER ASKED AFTER MRS IRWINE AND THE MISS IRWINES SIR
ADAM WAS STILL MOTIONLESS LOOKING AT HIM AS HE CAME UP
IT'S LIKE THE GLASS SOMETIMES ULL CRACK AS IT STANDS
AND NOW SHE FELT AS IF THE GREATEST WORK OF HER LIFE WERE TO BE DONE IN SEEING THAT THIAS WAS BURIED DECENTLY BEFORE HER--UNDER THE WHITE THORN WHERE ONCE IN A DREAM SHE HAD THOUGHT SHE LAY IN THE COFFIN YET ALL THE WHILE SAW THE SUNSHINE ABOVE AND SMELT THE WHITE BLOSSOMS THAT WERE SO THICK UPON THE THORN THE SUNDAY SHE WENT TO BE CHURCHED AFTER ADAM WAS BORN
AND NOW THERE IS ONE MORE THING I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY SHARE MY PLEASURE ABOUT IT AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE YOU WILL
AND HE RESOLVED FOR HIS PART TO SET HIS FACE AGAINST SUCH DOINGS
HER VERY WALK WAS DISCOURAGING
I PIQUE MYSELF ON MY WISDOM THERE ARTHUR AND AS AN OLD FELLOW TO WHOM WISDOM HAD BECOME CHEAP I BESTOW IT UPON YOU THANK YOU
IT'S A DREARY BLEAK PLACE
AND THE BELLS HAD BEEN RINGING SO THIS MORNING IN HONOUR OF THE CAPTAIN'S TWENTY-FIRST BIRTHDAY AND THE WORK HAD ALL BEEN GOT DONE SO EARLY THAT MARTY AND TOMMY WERE NOT QUITE EASY IN THEIR MINDS UNTIL THEIR MOTHER HAD ASSURED THEM THAT GOING TO CHURCH WAS NOT PART OF THE DAY'S FESTIVITIES
WE MUST GO STRAIGHT ON NOW
BUT I WON'T PART FROM YOU AND YOURS IF I CAN HELP IT MR POYSER
THAT'LL DO SAID HETTY AFTER A LITTLE WHILE
ARTHUR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
IT'S QUITE EASY T READ--SHE WRITES WONDERFUL FOR A WOMAN SETH HAD DRAWN THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND HELD IT OUT TO ADAM WHO SAID AS HE TOOK IT AYE LAD I'VE GOT A TOUGH LOAD TO CARRY JUST NOW--THEE MUSTNA TAKE IT ILL IF I'M A BIT SILENTER AND CRUSTIER NOR USUAL
I HANNA SEEN THE LAD THIS TWO HOUR--I'D WELLY FORGOT AS HE'D E'ER GROWED UP FROM A BABBY WHEN'S FEYTHER CARRIED HIM ADAM WAS SEATED ON A ROUGH BENCH HIS HEAD SUPPORTED BY HIS ARM WHICH RESTED FROM THE SHOULDER TO THE ELBOW ON THE LONG PLANING-TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORKSHOP
SHE LAID BY THE BRUSH AND TOOK UP THE DUSTER
MY AUNT WOULD BE ANGRY WITH ME IF I DIDN'T GET HOME BEFORE NINE PERHAPS CRAIG THE GARDENER COMES TO TAKE CARE OF YOU A DEEP BLUSH OVERSPREAD HETTY'S FACE AND NECK
I'N FED HIM WELL A'READY
BY AND BY MAKING SPEECHES AT ELECTION DINNERS AND SHOWING A WONDERFUL KNOWLEDGE OF AGRICULTURE
BUT BEFORE WE GOT TO HETTON BROTHER MARLOWE WAS SEIZED WITH A DIZZINESS THAT MADE HIM AFRAID OF FALLING FOR HE OVERWORKED HIMSELF SADLY AT HIS YEARS IN WATCHING AND PRAYING AND WALKING SO MANY MILES TO SPEAK THE WORD AS WELL AS CARRYING ON HIS TRADE OF LINEN-WEAVING
IT MUST--IT MUST HAVE COMFORT IN IT
YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER TO ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE ANY WRONG KNOWINGLY HETTY HAD LAID HER HAND ON THE LETTER BUT ADAM DID NOT LOOSE IT TILL HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT
I LONG TO TELL HER HOW I'VE THOUGHT OF HER ALL THESE YEARS DIDST TELL HIM I'D ALWAYS USED THE WATCH SAID DINAH
AND I AM QUITE OF MR POYSER'S OPINION THAT WHEN A MAN HAS SAID WHAT HE MEANS HE HAD BETTER STOP
HOW IS IT THAT THE POETS HAVE SAID SO MANY FINE THINGS ABOUT OUR FIRST LOVE SO FEW ABOUT OUR LATER LOVE
BUT HE FELT THAT BEYOND THESE IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO DEFER TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE KNOWING THAN HIMSELF
COME YOUNG WOMAN COME IN HE SAID AND HAVE ADROP O SOMETHING
THERE'S FATHER A-STANDING AT THE YARD-GATE SAID MARTIN POYSER
EVERY ONE MUST GET DOWN AT THE LODGES AND THE VEHICLES MUST BE SENT BACK
HIS CHEEKS BECAME FLUSHED AS HE WENT ON HIS MILD GREY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED AS HE SPOKE THE LAST SENTENCE
BUT ADAM COULD HARDLY FIND BREATH AND CALMNESS TO TELL CARROLL THAT HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO THE RECTOR
YOU CAN'T HINDER SOME OF THEM FROM GETTING TOO MUCH TOWARDS EVENING BUT DRUNKENNESS AND DARKNESS GO BETTER TOGETHER THAN DRUNKENNESS AND DAYLIGHT WELL I HOPE THERE WON'T BE MUCH OF IT
SHE TREMBLED UNDER HER AUNT'S GLANCE AND OPENED HER EYES
SHE HAD FOUND THE SHELTER
NO MORE NOR THE CAKE ULL COME WI'OUT THE LEAVEN
ADAM HAD NOT KNOWN BEFORE THAT ARTHUR HAD FURNISHED THE OLD HERMITAGE AND MADE IT A RETREAT FOR HIMSELF AND IT WAS A SURPRISE TO HIM WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR TO SEE A SNUG ROOM WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF FREQUENT HABITATION
LET IT ALONE BEN CRANAGE
BUT TO ALL HIS ANXIOUS TENDER QUESTIONS SHE REPLIED WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS QUITE CONTENTED AND WISHED NOTHING DIFFERENT
WHAT A PITY SUCH BEAUTY AS THAT SHOULD BE THROWN AWAY AMONG THE FARMERS WHEN IT'S WANTED SO TERRIBLY AMONG THE GOOD FAMILIES WITHOUT FORTUNE
HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
I'LL SET TWO-THREE STICKS A-LIGHT IN A MINUTE NAY MOTHER THANK THEE
THE COMMONEST MAN WHO HAS HIS OUNCE OF SENSE AND FEELING IS CONSCIOUS OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LOVELY DELICATE WOMAN AND A COARSE ONE
SUCH A RESPITE AS THERE IS IN THE FAINT WEARINESS WHICH OBLIGES A MAN TO THROW HIMSELF ON THE SAND INSTEAD OF TOILING ONWARD UNDER THE SCORCHING SUN
UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE HE WOULD RATHER GIVE UP THAN HAVE A QUARREL ANY DAY
I FEEL THAT I AM CALLED BACK TO THOSE AMONGST WHOM MY LOT WAS FIRST CAST
THEY SEEMED UNOBSERVANT OF ALL DETAILS
CHAPTER XLV IN THE PRISON NEAR SUNSET THAT EVENING AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WAS STANDING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE SMALLER ENTRANCE-DOOR OF STONITON JAIL SAYING A FEW LAST WORDS TO THE DEPARTING CHAPLAIN
IF A MAN SAYS A WORD HIS WIFE LL MATCH IT WITH A CONTRADICTION
AN UNDEFINED FEAR HAD SEIZED HIM--SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HETTY ON THE JOURNEY
OR IF HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED HELP IN ANY MATTER CONCERNING HETTY
A GRIN OF DELIGHT BROKE OVER TOM'S FACE AS THE PLATE WAS SET DOWN BEFORE HIM BETWEEN HIS KNIFE AND FORK WHICH HE HELD ERECT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SACRED TAPERS
HE WISHED HETTY WELL DOUBTLESS
FATHER'S TUMBLED INTO THE WATER
IT BECOMES A HABIT OF OUR LIVES AND WE CEASE TO IMAGINE A CONDITION OF PERFECT EASE AS POSSIBLE FOR US
LET EM PUT HIM ON HIS TRIAL--LET HIM STAND IN COURT BESIDE HER AND I'LL TELL EM HOW HE GOT HOLD OF HER HEART AND TICED HER T EVIL AND THEN LIED TO ME
DREADING NOTHING INDEED BUT FALSITY WHICH IN SPITE OF ONE'S BEST EFFORTS THERE IS REASON TO DREAD
IT'S NO USE MEETING TO SAY MORE HARD WORDS AND IT'S NO USE MEETING TO SHAKE HANDS AND SAY WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN
YOU KNOW HIM--WHERE IS HE A FINE SIGHT O MILES AWAY FROM HERE
A SOW WITH HER BROOD ALL VERY MUDDY AS TO THE LEGS AND CURLED AS TO THE TAIL THROWS IN SOME DEEP STACCATO NOTES
THE HALF-BENUMBED MENTAL CONDITION WHICH WAS THE EFFECT OF THE LAST NIGHT'S VIOLENT CRYING MADE IT NECESSARY TO HER TO LOOK AGAIN AND SEE IF HER WRETCHED THOUGHTS WERE ACTUALLY TRUE--IF THE LETTER WAS REALLY SO CRUEL
IT'S A DESPERATELY DULL BUSINESS BEING SHUT UP AT THE CHASE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN ONE CAN NEITHER HUNT NOR SHOOT SO AS TO MAKE ONE'S SELF PLEASANTLY SLEEPY IN THE EVENING
SHE IS IN STONYSHIRE--AT STONITON ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AS IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD HAVE LEAPED TO HER THAT MOMENT
I'VE BEEN A FOOL MYSELF IN MY TIME BUT THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND ME
HE'LL BE ANGRY WITH ME IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT
LET HER TREMBLE AT NOTHING BUT AT THE SIN THAT CUTS HER OFF FROM HIM
HIS FEELING TOWARDS DINAH THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM
SHE'S ONE O THOSE WOMEN THAT FEEL NO DRAWING TOWARDS HAVING A HUSBAND AND CHILDREN O THEIR OWN
THEY'LL HA PUTTEN THIAS BEDE I THE GROUND AFORE YE GET TO THE CHURCHYARD HE SAID AS HIS SON CAME UP
WHICH DO YOU BET ON GAWAINE THE LONG-LEGGED ONE UNLESS THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SEVERAL HEATS AND THEN THE LITTLE WIRY ONE MAY WIN THERE ARE THE POYSERS MOTHER NOT FAR OFF ON THE RIGHT HAND SAID MISS IRWINE
IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL
BUT WHEN A FORTNIGHT HAD PASSED THEY BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE SURPRISE THAT HETTY DID NOT RETURN
IT'S A HEAVY WEIGHT YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS GOOD-BYE BARTLE TILL WE MEET AT STONITON AS I DARESAY WE SHALL BARTLE HURRIED AWAY FROM THE RECTORY EVADING CARROLL'S CONVERSATIONAL ADVANCES AND SAYING IN AN EXASPERATED TONE TO VIXEN WHOSE SHORT LEGS PATTERED BESIDE HIM ON THE GRAVEL NOW I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO TAKE YOU WITH ME YOU GOOD-FOR-NOTHING WOMAN
AN THERE'S WILL HISSELF LOOKIN AS MEEK AS IF HE COULDNA KNOCK A NAIL O THE HEAD FOR FEAR O HURTIN'T
MR IRWINE SAID THERE WAS HOPE
WITH HER POOR NARROW THOUGHTS NO LONGER MELTING INTO VAGUE HOPES BUT PRESSED UPON BY THE CHILL OF DEFINITE FEAR REPEATING AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SAME SMALL ROUND OF MEMORIES--SHAPING AGAIN AND AGAIN THE SAME CHILDISH DOUBTFUL IMAGES OF WHAT WAS TO COME--SEEING NOTHING IN THIS WIDE WORLD BUT THE LITTLE HISTORY OF HER OWN PLEASURES AND PAINS
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS KNOT STOOD MR CASSON THE LANDLORD OF THE DONNITHORNE ARMS IN HIS MOST STRIKING ATTITUDE--THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND THRUST BETWEEN THE BUTTONS OF HIS WAISTCOAT HIS LEFT HAND IN HIS BREECHES POCKET AND HIS HEAD VERY MUCH ON ONE SIDE
WHEN Y ARE SIX-AN'-FORTY LIKE ME ISTID O SIX-AN'-TWENTY YE WONNA BE SO FLUSH O WORKIN FOR NOUGHT NONSENSE SAID ADAM STILL WRATHFUL
NOW GOOD-BYE
STICK IT IN YOUR FROCK AND THEN YOU CAN PUT IT IN WATER AFTER
LONG DARK EYELASHES NOW--WHAT CAN BE MORE EXQUISITE
PRETTIER THAN ANYBODY ABOUT HAYSLOPE--PRETTIER THAN ANY OF THE LADIES SHE HAD EVER SEEN VISITING AT THE CHASE--INDEED IT SEEMED FINE LADIES WERE RATHER OLD AND UGLY--AND PRETTIER THAN MISS BACON THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER WHO WAS CALLED THE BEAUTY OF TREDDLESTON
THEY HARDLY EVER SPOKE OF PERSONAL MATTERS OR UTTERED MORE THAN AN ALLUSION TO THEIR FAMILY TROUBLES
ARTHUR HAD NO SOONER COME TO THIS DETERMINATION THAN HE BEGAN TO THINK WHICH OF THE PATHS WOULD LEAD HIM HOME AND MADE AS SHORT A WALK THITHER AS HE COULD
OH I USED TO WATCH EM OFTEN WHEN I WAS A LAD
HOW THE BROOK HAS OVERFLOWED
IT WAS NO USE BLINKING THE FACT NOW--THEY WOULD GET TOO FOND OF EACH OTHER IF HE WENT ON TAKING NOTICE OF HER--AND WHAT WOULD COME OF IT
TO HAVE NOTTINGHAM LACE ROUND THE TOP OF HER GOWN AND SOMETHING TO MAKE HER HANDKERCHIEF SMELL NICE LIKE MISS LYDIA DONNITHORNE'S WHEN SHE DREW IT OUT AT CHURCH
IT CONTAINED A SEALED ENCLOSURE DIRECTED TO HETTY
AND NOW ALL FACES WERE VISIBLE FOR ALL WERE STANDING UP--THE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE SEATS PEEPING OVER THE EDGE OF THE GREY PEWS WHILE GOOD BISHOP KEN'S EVENING HYMN WAS BEING SUNG TO ONE OF THOSE LIVELY PSALM-TUNES WHICH DIED OUT WITH THE LAST GENERATION OF RECTORS AND CHORAL PARISH CLERKS
YOU'D BE WANTING THE CLOCK SET BY GENTLEFOLKS'S TIME WOULD YOU
THEN WE SHALL BE ABLE TO ADMIRE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE OF OUR PREPOSSESSIONS
ADAM HAD NOT DARED TO LOOK AT HER IN THE FIRST MOMENTS BUT AT LAST WHEN THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT WAS WITHDRAWN BY THE PROCEEDINGS HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS HER WITH A RESOLUTION NOT TO SHRINK
AN ASSAULT ON OUR POCKETS WHICH IN MORE BARBAROUS TIMES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE BRUSQUE FORM OF A PISTOL-SHOT IS QUITE A WELL-BRED AND SMILING PROCEDURE NOW IT HAS BECOME A REQUEST FOR A LOAN THROWN IN AS AN EASY PARENTHESIS BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD GLASSES OF CLARET
THE BASKET WAS THE ONE WHICH ON WORKDAYS HELD ADAM'S AND SETH'S DINNER
THERE'S NO OCCASION FOR ME TO SAY ANY MORE ABOUT WHAT I FEEL TOWARDS HIM
HE HAD WORKED OFF HIS ANGER NOW AND WHENEVER HE WISHED TO BE ESPECIALLY KIND TO HIS MOTHER HE FELL INTO HIS STRONGEST NATIVE ACCENT AND DIALECT WITH WHICH AT OTHER TIMES HIS SPEECH WAS LESS DEEPLY TINGED
IT NEVER ENTERED INTO HER MIND THAT ADAM WAS PITIABLE TOO--THAT ADAM TOO MUST SUFFER ONE DAY
BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
BUT"--ADAM CONTINUED IN A DECIDED TONE--"I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO MAKE ANY OFFERS TO MR BURGE OR T HAVE ANY MADE FOR ME
I'M WILLING TO PAY ANY MONEY AS IS WANTED TOWARDS TRYING TO BRING HER OFF SAID MARTIN THE YOUNGER WHEN MR IRWINE WAS GONE WHILE THE OLD GRANDFATHER WAS CRYING IN THE OPPOSITE CHAIR BUT I'LL NOT GO NIGH HER NOR EVER SEE HER AGAIN BY MY OWN WILL
THE GREEN MAN ISN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY OH YES I'LL BE VERY GLAD IF YOU'LL GIVE ME THAT SAID HETTY RELIEVED AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE JEWELLER'S AND BE STARED AT AND QUESTIONED
WHAT HAD HE DONE BY FIGHTING
FAREWELL ADAM
THAT WAS THE ALL-CONQUERING FEELING IN THE MIND BOTH OF FATHER AND SON--THE SCORCHING SENSE OF DISGRACE WHICH NEUTRALISED ALL OTHER SENSIBILITY--AND MR IRWINE WAS STRUCK WITH SURPRISE TO OBSERVE THAT MRS POYSER WAS LESS SEVERE THAN HER HUSBAND
THERE'LL BE A BIT GOT HIN IF WE'VE GOOD LUCK AND HE SAYS EH YE MAY BE RAIGHT THERE'S NOO TALLIN HE SAYS AND I KNOWED BY THAT"--HERE MR CASSON GAVE A WINK--"AS HE DIDN'T COME FROM A HUNDRED MILE OFF
I SAW NO REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TAKE THE YOUNG WOMAN IN FOR THE NIGHT
THOSE STRIPED UNS HAVE NO SMELL
SETH FELT THAT THAT WAS THE GREATEST HAPPINESS HE COULD LOOK FORWARD TO FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HE HAD NO HOPE LEFT THAT SHE WOULD EVER LOVE HIM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
THE TOP LETTER WAS PLACED WITH ITS ADDRESS UPWARDS
THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REALITY AND THE VISION WAS THAT IN HIS DREAM HETTY WAS CONTINUALLY COMING BEFORE HIM IN BODILY PRESENCE--STRANGELY MINGLING HERSELF AS AN ACTOR IN SCENES WITH WHICH SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
BUT I CAN SEE AS SHE DOESNA BEHAVE TOW'RT THEE AS SHE DAES TOW'RT SETH
I DESIRE TO LIVE AND DIE WITHOUT HUSBAND OR CHILDREN
AND THEY ALL WEPT SORE AND FELL ON PAUL'S NECK AND KISSED HIM THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR DINAH
HE MUST NOT SEE HER ALONE AGAIN
I ATE A GOOD MEAL BEFORE I CAME AWAY FOR MRS BEDE WOULD MAKE A KETTLE-CAKE FOR ME I DON'T WANT ANY SUPPER SAID HETTY TAKING OFF HER HAT
BUT YOU'LL WAIT
UNLESS SHE COULD AFFORD ALWAYS TO GO IN THE COACHES--AND SHE FELT SURE SHE COULD NOT FOR THE JOURNEY TO STONITON WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED--IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE MUST TRUST TO CARRIERS CARTS OR SLOW WAGGONS
BUT IT WENT ON AND SEEMED SO STRANGE TO ME IN THAT PLACE I COULDN'T HELP STOPPING TO LOOK
GIVE THE LADS A BAGPIPE INSTEAD OF A RATTLE AND I'LL ANSWER FOR IT THE CORN LL BE SAFE YES THERE'S FOLKS AS FIND A PLEASURE IN UNDERVALLYING WHAT THEY KNOW BUT LITTLE ABOUT SAID MR CRAIG
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED AND ANNOYED
HE WOULD DO THE THING HE HAD RESOLVED TO DO WITHOUT FLINCHING
COME BE CHEERFUL AGAIN
I'LL MAKE YOU A PRESENT O THE SCREEN IF YOU PLEASE
WE ARE CHILDREN OF A LARGE FAMILY AND MUST LEARN AS SUCH CHILDREN DO NOT TO EXPECT THAT OUR HURTS WILL BE MADE MUCH OF--TO BE CONTENT WITH LITTLE NURTURE AND CARESSING AND HELP EACH OTHER THE MORE
I KNOW YOU THINK A HUSBAND UD BE TAKING UP TOO MUCH O YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE ST PAUL SAYS SHE THAT'S MARRIED CARETH FOR THE THINGS OF THE WORLD HOW SHE MAY PLEASE HER HUSBAND
WHILE HETTY'S HANDS WERE BUSY PACKING UP THE BUTTER AND HER HEAD FILLED WITH THESE PICTURES OF THE MORROW ARTHUR DONNITHORNE RIDING BY MR IRWINE'S SIDE TOWARDS THE VALLEY OF THE WILLOW BROOK HAD ALSO CERTAIN INDISTINCT ANTICIPATIONS RUNNING AS AN UNDERCURRENT IN HIS MIND WHILE HE WAS LISTENING TO MR IRWINE'S ACCOUNT OF DINAH--INDISTINCT YET STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM FEEL RATHER CONSCIOUS WHEN MR IRWINE SUDDENLY SAID WHAT FASCINATED YOU SO IN MRS POYSER'S DAIRY ARTHUR
AN THERE'S THE LADS AND THE LITTLE UN ULL GROW UP IN A NEW PARISH AS WELL AS I TH OLD UN AH THERE'S NO STAYING I THIS COUNTRY FOR US NOW SAID MR POYSER AND THE HARD TEARS TRICKLED SLOWLY DOWN HIS ROUND CHEEKS
A FAINT BLUSH CAME WHICH DEEPENED AS SHE WONDERED AT IT
THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT--THE COACHES WERE TOO DEAR--SHE MUST GIVE THEM UP
WHAT SHALL WE DO IF HE IS NOT OUR FRIEND THEN DINAH TOLD HOW THE GOOD NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT AND HOW THE MIND OF GOD TOWARDS THE POOR HAD BEEN MADE MANIFEST IN THE LIFE OF JESUS DWELLING ON ITS LOWLINESS AND ITS ACTS OF MERCY
SHE HAD BEEN NOTICED HERE TOO AND WAS REMEMBERED TO HAVE SAT ON THE BOX BY THE COACHMAN
EH MY LADS
SHE WAS AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL NEAR THE STAIRCASE WHISPERING WITH MOLLY WHO HAD JUST GIVEN THE SLEEPING TOTTY INTO HER ARMS BEFORE RUNNING TO FETCH SHAWLS AND BONNETS FROM THE LANDING
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING HETTY HAD SEATED HERSELF AS SHE TIED ON HER CAP AND NOW DINAH LEANED FORWARDS AND TOOK HER HANDS AS SHE ANSWERED BECAUSE DEAR TROUBLE COMES TO US ALL IN THIS LIFE
EVERYTHING WAS LOOKING AT ITS BRIGHTEST AT THIS MOMENT FOR THE SUN SHONE RIGHT ON THE PEWTER DISHES AND FROM THEIR REFLECTING SURFACES PLEASANT JETS OF LIGHT WERE THROWN ON MELLOW OAK AND BRIGHT BRASS--AND ON A STILL PLEASANTER OBJECT THAN THESE FOR SOME OF THE RAYS FELL ON DINAH'S FINELY MOULDED CHEEK AND LIT UP HER PALE RED HAIR TO AUBURN AS SHE BENT OVER THE HEAVY HOUSEHOLD LINEN WHICH SHE WAS MENDING FOR HER AUNT
IT WAS A HORRIBLE SENSATION--THIS COLD AND TREMBLING
AND THEN IF YOU WOULD TALK TO THE POYSERS--IF YOU WOULD TALK THE MATTER OVER WITH MR IRWINE--HE MEANS TO SEE YOU TO-MORROW--AND THEN IF YOU WOULD JOIN YOUR ARGUMENTS TO HIS TO PREVAIL ON THEM NOT TO GO....I KNOW OF COURSE THAT THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT ANY FAVOUR FROM ME--I MEAN NOTHING OF THAT KIND--BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULD SUFFER LESS IN THE END
FOR MY HUSBAND HEARD AT MARKET AS LORD DACEY'S ELDEST SON HAD LOST THOUSANDS UPO THOUSANDS TO THE PRINCE O WALES AND THEY SAID MY LADY WAS GOING TO PAWN HER JEWELS TO PAY FOR HIM
IT'S PRETTY CERTAIN THEY SAY THAT THERE'LL BE A PEACE SOON THOUGH NOBODY BELIEVES IT'LL LAST LONG
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY MORE BOOKS FROM BARTLE MASSEY BUT HE HAD NO TIME FOR READING THE COMMIN PRINT AS LISBETH CALLED IT SO BUSY AS HE WAS WITH FIGURES IN ALL THE LEISURE MOMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT FILL UP WITH EXTRA CARPENTRY
I WISH I COULD HAVE GOT TO HIM TO BE WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED
BUT SHE'S COMING TO AGAIN
HE MUST KEEP OUT OF HER WAY
BUT THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE THE POSSIBILITIES TO WHICH SHE COULD GIVE NO SHAPE BEGAN TO PRESS UPON HER LIKE THE INVISIBLE WEIGHT OF AIR
AT LAST HE SAID SATCHELL'S GOT A PARALYTIC STROKE
AFTER ALL I BELIEVE THE WISEST OF US MUST BE BEGUILED IN THIS WAY SOMETIMES AND MUST THINK BOTH BETTER AND WORSE OF PEOPLE THAN THEY DESERVE
IT IS TRUE MR RYDE INSISTED STRONGLY ON THE DOCTRINES OF THE REFORMATION VISITED HIS FLOCK A GREAT DEAL IN THEIR OWN HOMES AND WAS SEVERE IN REBUKING THE ABERRATIONS OF THE FLESH--PUT A STOP INDEED TO THE CHRISTMAS ROUNDS OF THE CHURCH SINGERS AS PROMOTING DRUNKENNESS AND TOO LIGHT A HANDLING OF SACRED THINGS
I'LL BE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MR BEDE IF YOU'LL GO AND SEND HER IN
HETTY HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES GLISTENING FROM HER IMAGINARY DRAMA HER BEAUTIFUL NECK AND ARMS BARE HER HAIR HANGING IN A CURLY TANGLE DOWN HER BACK AND THE BAUBLES IN HER EARS
SHE COULD GATHER NO ELATION OF SPIRITS NOW BY LOOKING FORWARD BUT ONLY BY LOOKING BACKWARD TO BUILD CONFIDENCE ON PAST WORDS AND CARESSES
BUT HIS MOTHER THREW DOWN HER KNITTING AND HURRYING AFTER HIM TOOK HOLD OF HIS ARM AND SAID IN A TONE OF PLAINTIVE REMONSTRANCE NAY MY LAD MY LAD THEE MUNNA GO WI'OUT THY SUPPER
HOW IS A CHRISTIAN MAN TO WIN A GAME OFF YOU
IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A MAN NECESSARILY GETS IN AN ILL HUMOUR AND WORKS OFF THE IRRITATION BY SOME EXCESS OR OTHER
BUT IT'S STILL A BLEAK PLACE AS YOU SAY SIR--VERY DIFFERENT FROM THIS COUNTRY YOU HAVE RELATIONS LIVING THERE PROBABLY SO THAT YOU ARE ATTACHED TO THE PLACE AS YOUR HOME I HAD AN AUNT THERE ONCE
THEIR FATHER MATTHIAS BEDE WAS DROWNED IN THE WILLOW BROOK LAST NIGHT NOT FAR FROM HIS OWN DOOR
GOOD-NIGHT SHE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM ALMOST AS QUIETLY AND QUICKLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A GHOST
I LIKE TO SEE THAT WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW HIM MOTHER SAID MR IRWINE
AND THE NEXT DAY--IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK--ARTHUR HAD RIDDEN OVER TO ROSSETER ON PURPOSE TO BUY THEM
BUT FROM MY CHILDHOOD UPWARDS I HAVE BEEN LED TOWARDS ANOTHER PATH
ONE LIKES TO PAUSE IN THE MILD RAYS OF THE SUN AND LOOK OVER THE GATES AT THE PATIENT PLOUGH-HORSES TURNING AT THE END OF THE FURROW AND THINK THAT THE BEAUTIFUL YEAR IS ALL BEFORE ONE
SHE APPEALED FIRST TO ONE AND THEN TO ANOTHER BESEECHING THEM WITH TEARS TO TURN TO GOD WHILE THERE WAS YET TIME
I'M THE BEST WHEN I'VE A GOOD DAY'S MARCH OR FIGHTING BEFORE ME HE'S OF A RASH WARM-HEARTED NATURE LIKE ESAU FOR WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS FELT GREAT PITY SAID DINAH
AN THEE LOOKST AS WHITE AS A FLICK O NEW BACON
SHE HAD NEVER LOST THE IMAGE OF HIM AS SHE HAD SEEN HIM IN THE PRISON
I FEEL DRAWN AGAIN TOWARDS THE HILLS WHERE I USED TO BE BLESSED IN CARRYING THE WORD OF LIFE TO THE SINFUL AND DESOLATE YOU FEEL
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU CAN KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD IF YOU LIKE AND I HOPE YOU'LL NOT LET DROP A WORD TILL IT'S COMMON TALK FOR I'VE PARTICULAR REASONS AGAINST ITS BEING KNOWN TRUST TO ME MY BOY TRUST TO ME
BUT ADAM DID NOT COME DOWN AGAIN
THEE MUST BE THE BETTER TO HIM NOW HE'S GONE
WHEN YOU THOUGHT OF MARRYING HER YOU'D A NOTION SHE'D GOT ANOTHER SORT OF A NATURE INSIDE HER
BUT HE'S NONE SO FOND O YOUR DISSENTERS FOR ALL THAT MAYBE
I'LL GO WITH YOU LAD SAID BARTLE
TRY RATHER TO DIVEST YOURSELF OF ALL YOUR RATIONAL PREJUDICES AS MUCH AS IF YOU WERE STUDYING THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A CANARY BIRD AND ONLY WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THIS PRETTY ROUND CREATURE AS SHE TURNS HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS SMILE AT THE EAR-RINGS NESTLED IN THE LITTLE BOX
I'VE GOT A WORD TO SAY TO YOU ARTHUR PAUSED IN SURPRISE
I'LL JUST LOOK IN AT ADAM AGAIN AND SEE IF HE'LL LET ME GO ON WITH THE COFFIN HA A DROP O WARM BROTH SAID LISBETH WHOSE MOTHERLY FEELING NOW GOT THE BETTER OF HER NATTERING HABIT
SHE WOULD NEED NOTHING AT WINDSOR BUT TO FIND ARTHUR
PERFECT WEATHER FOR AN OUTDOOR JULY MERRY-MAKING YET SURELY NOT THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO BE BORN IN
BUT EVERY SENSIBLE MAN KNOWS HOW NECESSARY THAT HUMBLE EVERYDAY WORK IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WELL
BUT WHEN HE LOOSED THE LETTER SHE PUT IT INTO HER POCKET WITHOUT OPENING IT AND THEN BEGAN TO WALK MORE QUICKLY AS IF SHE WANTED TO GO IN
THERE WAS STILL A GREAT REMNANT OF PAIN AND THIS HE FELT WOULD SUBSIST AS LONG AS HER PAIN WAS NOT A MEMORY BUT AN EXISTING THING WHICH HE MUST THINK OF AS RENEWED WITH THE LIGHT OF EVERY NEW MORNING
SHE WAS READY TO CRY
THEN HE BURST OUT AGAIN IN A TONE OF APPEALING ANGUISH I CAN'T BEAR IT...O GOD IT'S TOO HARD TO LAY UPON ME--IT'S TOO HARD TO THINK SHE'S WICKED MR IRWINE HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN IN SILENCE
IT'S BEEN GONE THIS FORTNIGHT LOOK THERE
HE WAS A DYER WHO IN THE COURSE OF DIPPING HOMESPUN WOOL AND OLD WOMEN'S PETTICOATS HAD GOT FIRED WITH THE AMBITION TO LEARN A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT THE STRANGE SECRETS OF COLOUR
THEE'DST BETTER NOT WAKE HIM
I WENT TO FIND HIM AS HE MIGHT TAKE CARE OF ME
IT WAS DREADFULLY LONG BEFORE THE GENERAL CONFESSION BEGAN SO THAT SHE COULD KNEEL DOWN
THE WOMEN INDEED USUALLY ENTERED THE CHURCH AT ONCE AND THE FARMERS WIVES TALKED IN AN UNDERTONE TO EACH OTHER OVER THE TALL PEWS ABOUT THEIR ILLNESSES AND THE TOTAL FAILURE OF DOCTOR'S STUFF RECOMMENDING DANDELION-TEA AND OTHER HOME-MADE SPECIFICS AS FAR PREFERABLE--ABOUT THE SERVANTS AND THEIR GROWING EXORBITANCE AS TO WAGES WHEREAS THE QUALITY OF THEIR SERVICES DECLINED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THERE WAS NO GIRL NOWADAYS TO BE TRUSTED ANY FURTHER THAN YOU COULD SEE HER--ABOUT THE BAD PRICE MR DINGALL THE TREDDLESTON GROCER WAS GIVING FOR BUTTER AND THE REASONABLE DOUBTS THAT MIGHT BE HELD AS TO HIS SOLVENCY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT MRS DINGALL WAS A SENSIBLE WOMAN AND THEY WERE ALL SORRY FOR HER FOR SHE HAD VERY GOOD KIN
AND WHEN THE CLERGYMAN TOLD ME HOW THE HAND OF GOD WAS HEAVY UPON YOU MY HEART WENT OUT TOWARDS YOU AND I FELT A COMMAND TO COME AND BE TO YOU IN THE PLACE OF A DAUGHTER IN THIS GRIEF IF YOU WILL LET ME AH
GOD BLESS HER HE SAID INWARDLY
BUT THERE'S NO GETTING A WOMAN WITHOUT SOME FOOLISHNESS OR OTHER ADAM NEVER WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT
YOU CANNA FOR SHAME STAND STILL ADAM AN YOU A FINE YOUNG FELLOW AND CAN DANCE AS WELL AS ANYBODY NAY NAY SAID MRS POYSER IT UD BE UNBECOMIN I KNOW THE DANCIN'S NONSENSE BUT IF YOU STICK AT EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT'S NONSENSE YOU WONNA GO FAR I THIS LIFE
I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU AS DINAH CROSSED THE PRISON COURT WITH THE TURNKEY THE SOLEMN EVENING LIGHT SEEMED TO MAKE THE WALLS HIGHER THAN THEY WERE BY DAY AND THE SWEET PALE FACE IN THE CAP WAS MORE THAN EVER LIKE A WHITE FLOWER ON THIS BACKGROUND OF GLOOM
AND THE BABIES ALWAYS SEEM TO LIKE THE STRONG ARM BEST
THERE'S NOT MUCH LIKELIHOOD THAT TH OLD SQUIRE UD EVER CONSENT T EMPLOY ME
OF DINAH'S AFFECTIONATE ENTREATY TO THINK OF HER AS A FRIEND IN TROUBLE
WE CAN BREAK IT WHEN WE LIKE AN I'M IN NO FEAR O BONY FOR ALL THEY TALK SO MUCH O HIS CLIVERNESS
SOME O THE BRETHREN AT TREDDLES'ON ARE DISPLEASED WITH HER FOR THAT WHERE WILL SHE BE THE REST O THE DAY SAID ADAM
HE'S A GOOD CHURCHMAN ELSE I'D NEVER ENCOURAGE HIM FOR A SWEETHEART FOR HETTY WHY GOODNESS ME SAID MRS POYSER WHO HAD LOOKED BACK WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS SPEAKING LOOK WHERE MOLLY IS WITH THEM LADS
HE CAN'T OBJECT TO THAT
ALL THE REST WAS DARKNESS
SHE'S WELL ENOUGH IF SHE'D LET ALONE PREACHIN
YEA LORD I SEE THEE COMING THROUGH THE DARKNESS COMING LIKE THE MORNING WITH HEALING ON THY WINGS
AN WHAT'S HE COME TO
SHE HAD STILL TWO-AND-TWENTY SHILLINGS
SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO KIND AND OPEN TO HIM AS SHE USED TO BE
COULD SHE BE THE SAME HETTY THAT USED TO MAKE UP THE BUTTER IN THE DAIRY WITH THE GUELDER ROSES PEEPING IN AT THE WINDOW--SHE A RUNAWAY WHOM HER FRIENDS WOULD NOT OPEN THEIR DOORS TO AGAIN LYING IN THIS STRANGE BED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR WHAT SHE RECEIVED AND MUST OFFER THOSE STRANGERS SOME OF THE CLOTHES IN HER BASKET
HIS USUAL SLOWNESS WAS ALWAYS TREBLED WHEN THE SUBJECT OF SPEECH WAS PAINFUL
IT STRUCK HIM WITH SURPRISE FOR THE GREY EYES USUALLY SO MILD AND GRAVE HAD THE BRIGHT UNEASY GLANCE WHICH ACCOMPANIES SUPPRESSED AGITATION AND THE SLIGHT FLUSH IN HER CHEEKS WITH WHICH SHE HAD COME DOWNSTAIRS WAS HEIGHTENED TO A DEEP ROSE-COLOUR
HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY TO HER
IT WAS A FRESH ASSURANCE TO HER THAT THE FARM-YARD WAS WELL GUARDED AND THAT NO LOITERERS COULD ENTER UNOBSERVED
MRS POYSER THOUGHT SHE NOTICED A SURPRISING IMPROVEMENT IN HETTY
AS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS HE WAS COMING VERY NEAR TO THE END OF HIS WALK WITHIN THE SOUND OF THE HAMMERS AT WORK ON THE REFITTING OF THE OLD HOUSE
AND THIS BLESSED GIFT OF VENERATING LOVE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO TOO MANY HUMBLE CRAFTSMEN SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN FOR US TO FEEL ANY SURPRISE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE SOUL OF A METHODIST CARPENTER HALF A CENTURY AGO WHILE THERE WAS YET A LINGERING AFTER-GLOW FROM THE TIME WHEN WESLEY AND HIS FELLOW-LABOURER FED ON THE HIPS AND HAWS OF THE CORNWALL HEDGES AFTER EXHAUSTING LIMBS AND LUNGS IN CARRYING A DIVINE MESSAGE TO THE POOR
HETTY WE KNOW WAS NOT THE FIRST WOMAN THAT HAD BEHAVED MORE GENTLY TO THE MAN WHO LOVED HER IN VAIN BECAUSE SHE HAD HERSELF BEGUN TO LOVE ANOTHER
THE LITTLE PUSS SEEMS ALREADY TO HAVE AIRS ENOUGH TO MAKE A HUSBAND AS MISERABLE AS IT'S A LAW OF NATURE FOR A QUIET MAN TO BE WHEN HE MARRIES A BEAUTY
HIS GRANDFATHER PERSISTED IN RETAINING AS HEAD GROOM AN OLD DOLT WHOM NO SORT OF LEVER COULD MOVE OUT OF HIS OLD HABITS AND WHO WAS ALLOWED TO HIRE A SUCCESSION OF RAW LOAMSHIRE LADS AS HIS SUBORDINATES ONE OF WHOM HAD LATELY TESTED A NEW PAIR OF SHEARS BY CLIPPING AN OBLONG PATCH ON ARTHUR'S BAY MARE
FOR I BELIEVE HE'S ONE O THOSE GENTLEMEN AS WISHES TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND TO LEAVE THE WORLD A BIT BETTER THAN HE FOUND IT WHICH IT'S MY BELIEF EVERY MAN MAY DO WHETHER HE'S GENTLE OR SIMPLE WHETHER HE SETS A GOOD BIT O WORK GOING AND FINDS THE MONEY OR WHETHER HE DOES THE WORK WITH HIS OWN HANDS
THEN CAME SETH SERENELY HAPPY WITH MRS POYSER ON HIS ARM
IT WAS OPENED BY A VERY CLEAN OLD WOMAN WITH A SLOW PALSIED SHAKE OF THE HEAD
SO ADAM WAS CONSOLED FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD FELT WHEN SETH HAD COME BACK FROM HIS VISIT TO SNOWFIELD AND SAID IT WAS NO USE--DINAH'S HEART WASNA TURNED TOWARDS MARRYING FOR WHEN HE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT HETTY WAS WILLING THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER AND THERE WAS NO MORE NEED OF THEM TO THINK OF PARTING SHE SAID IN A MORE CONTENTED TONE THAN HE HAD HEARD HER SPEAK IN SINCE IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT HE WAS TO BE MARRIED EH MY LAD I'LL BE AS STILL AS TH OULD TABBY AN NE'ER WANT TO DO AUGHT BUT TH OFFAL WORK AS SHE WONNA LIKE T DO
GOD HAD GIVEN HER A LOVING SELF-FORGETTING NATURE AND HE PERFECTED IT BY GRACE
I WANT TO TELL MY MOTHER WHAT A SPLENDID THRONE YOU'VE PREPARED FOR HER UNDER THE MARQUEE YES AND WE MUST BE GOING TO LUNCHEON TOO SAID ARTHUR
YOU'RE ACTING WITH YOUR EYES OPEN WHATEVER YOU MAY DO
I SUPPOSE THE LOVE-MAKING DOESN'T RUN SMOOTH OR PERHAPS ADAM HANGS BACK TILL HE'S IN A BETTER POSITION
I SHALL FEEL AS UNEASY AS A NEW SHEARED SHEEP WHEN SHE'S GONE FROM ME
SOME OF YOU ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS AND I BELIEVE THERE IS NOT ONE HERE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH OF HIM TO JOIN HEARTILY IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AS MR IRWINE PAUSED ARTHUR JUMPED UP AND FILLING HIS GLASS SAID A BUMPER TO ADAM BEDE AND MAY HE LIVE TO HAVE SONS AS FAITHFUL AND CLEVER AS HIMSELF NO HEARER NOT EVEN BARTLE MASSEY WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THIS TOAST AS MR POYSER
I DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT I'M PROUD OF MY PUPIL WHEN HE DOES GRACEFUL THINGS
GIVE THEM A FRIENDLY KICK
THE OLD GREEN GRAVESTONES WITH NETTLES ROUND THEM
IF I'D KNOWN IT SOONER I'D HAVE COME AN HOW'S THEE T KNOW IF THEE DOSTNA COOM
I'D WISH FOR NO BETTER LOT THAN TO WORK UNDER HIM AND TO KNOW THAT WHILE I WAS GETTING MY OWN BREAD I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIS INT'RESTS
SHE'D A VERY TENDER WAY WITH HER DINAH HAD
HIS RIGHT HAND HELD HER LEFT AND HE PRESSED HER ARM CLOSE AGAINST HIS HEART AS HE LEANED DOWN TOWARDS HER
SHE FELT NO THRILL WHEN SHE SAW HIM PASSING ALONG THE CAUSEWAY BY THE WINDOW OR ADVANCING TOWARDS HER UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE FOOTPATH ACROSS THE MEADOW
WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEE
BUT NOW SHE CAME FORWARD AND PUTTING OUT HER ARMS SAID COME TOTTY COME AND LET DINAH CARRY HER UPSTAIRS ALONG WITH MOTHER
THERE IS THE SAME TYPE OF FRAME AND THE SAME KEEN ACTIVITY OF TEMPERAMENT IN MOTHER AND SON BUT IT WAS NOT FROM HER THAT ADAM GOT HIS WELL-FILLED BROW AND HIS EXPRESSION OF LARGE-HEARTED INTELLIGENCE
AN THEN IT WAS NOTHIN BUT NIGHTMARE AS TIRED ME WORSE NOR WAKIN WHY WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THE MATTER JOSHUA
IF ANYTHING COULD TURN HER I SHOULD HA TURNED HER FOR I'VE TALKED TO HER FOR A HOUR ON END AND SCOLDED HER TOO
I'D RATHER GO SOUTH'ARD WHERE THEY SAY IT'S AS FLAT AS A TABLE THAN COME TO LIVE HERE
COME HELP ME ON MY LEGS I FEEL TERRIBLY SHAKY AND DIZZY ARTHUR SAID AS HE STOOD LEANING ON ADAM'S ARM
AND HE'D BE RARE AN LOVIN
I'M FAIR BEAT WI SETH FOR I'VE BEEN TEASIN HIM IVER SIN WE'VE BEEN WORKIN TOGETHER AN HE BEARS ME NO MORE MALICE NOR A LAMB
NAY MOTHER NAY HE SAID EARNESTLY THEE MUSTNA THINK O SPEAKING O SUCH THINGS TO ADAM
DINAH'S BEEN GONE TO LEEDS EVER SINCE LAST FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT THE VERY DAY HETTY SET OUT
SIMPLE ADDITION ENOUGH
I KNOW THE WORST CONSEQUENCES WILL REMAIN
AND WHEN I GOT OUT INTO THE FIELDS IT WAS AS IF I WAS HELD FAST--I COULDN'T GO AWAY FOR ALL I WANTED SO TO GO
AND AS FOR MR CRAIG THE GARDENER HE WAS A SENSIBLE MAN ENOUGH TO BE SURE BUT HE WAS KNOCK-KNEED AND HAD A QUEER SORT OF SING-SONG IN HIS TALK
FOR THE FIRST FEW MILES OUT OF STONITON SHE WALKED ON BRAVELY ALWAYS FIXING ON SOME TREE OR GATE OR PROJECTING BUSH AT THE MOST DISTANT VISIBLE POINT IN THE ROAD AS A GOAL AND FEELING A FAINT JOY WHEN SHE HAD REACHED IT
I'LL GET YOU ALONG SAID ADAM
MRS BEST SAID IT WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN TO BE BY THEMSELVES
SHE'S GOT A FACE LIKE A LILY SETH'S SOUL RUSHED TO HIS EYES AND LIPS
THERE'S THE CHAPLAIN O THE JAIL SITS NEAR HER BUT HE'S A SHARP FERRETY-FACED MAN--ANOTHER SORT O FLESH AND BLOOD TO MR IRWINE
IF THE THOUGHT OF YOU TOOK SLIGHT HOLD OF ME I SHOULD NOT FEAR THAT IT WOULD BE AN IDOL IN THE TEMPLE
CHAPTER XXIX THE NEXT MORNING ARTHUR DID NOT PASS A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
HE SWALLERS SIXPENN'ORTH O ALE AN SAVES A HAP'ORTH O POR-RIDGE--THAT'S HIS WAY O LAYIN BY MONEY AS I'VE TOLD HIM MANY A TIME AN AM LIKELY TO TELL HIM AGAIN AFORE THE DAY'S OUT
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL FEEL AND I CAN'T HELP FEELING A LITTLE OF IT MYSELF
THEN DINAH SAID HETTY WE ARE BEFORE GOD
WHAT'S HE ALLAYS GOIN TO THE POYSERS FOR IF HE DIDNA WANT T SEE HER
WE TAKE A LESS GLOOMY VIEW OF OUR ERRORS NOW OUR FATHER CONFESSOR LISTENS TO US OVER HIS EGG AND COFFEE
WE CAN SEE THE SWEET PALE FACE QUITE WELL NOW
HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT
JOHN CONSIDERED A YOUNG MASTER AS THE NATURAL ENEMY OF AN OLD SERVANT AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN GENERAL AS A POOR CONTRIVANCE FOR CARRYING ON THE WORLD
NO I GO BACK TO SNOWFIELD ON SATURDAY AND I SHALL HAVE TO SET OUT TO TREDDLESTON EARLY TO BE IN TIME FOR THE OAKBOURNE CARRIER
THEY WOULD THINK HER CONDUCT SHAMEFUL AND SHAME WAS TORTURE
I'M NOT FOR LONG COURTSHIPS BUT THERE MUST BE A BIT O TIME TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE AYE TO BE SURE SAID MRS POYSER IN A HOARSE WHISPER
HER IMAGINATION HAD CREATED A THORNY THICKET OF SIN AND SORROW IN WHICH SHE SAW THE POOR THING STRUGGLING TORN AND BLEEDING LOOKING WITH TEARS FOR RESCUE AND FINDING NONE
BUT DID YOU KNOW THIS CRIMINAL HETTY SORREL YES WE ARE KIN
FIRST A BRIGHT PATCH OF COLOUR LIKE A TROPIC BIRD AMONG THE BOUGHS
I WOULD DO ANYTHING THERE IS NO SACRIFICE I WOULD NOT MAKE TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER INJURY TO OTHERS THROUGH MY--THROUGH WHAT HAS HAPPENED ARTHUR'S WORDS HAD PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE EFFECT TO THAT HE HAD ANTICIPATED
I AM A LABOURER AND LIVE AT TEDD'S HOLE TWO MILES OUT OF STONITON
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE WORDS MUCH BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I REMEMBER FIRST HEARING THEM
AND IT IS REALLY ASTONISHING THAT THE CENTAURS WITH THEIR IMMENSE ADVANTAGES IN THIS WAY HAVE LEFT SO BAD A REPUTATION IN HISTORY
FOR OUR LIFE IS FULL OF TROUBLE AND IF GOD SENDS US GOOD HE SEEMS TO SEND BAD TOO
SHE WIPED THEM AWAY QUICKLY
SOME DAY SHE WILL BE ABLE TO WEAR ANY EAR-RINGS SHE LIKES AND ALREADY SHE LIVES IN AN INVISIBLE WORLD OF BRILLIANT COSTUMES SHIMMERING GAUZE SOFT SATIN AND VELVET SUCH AS THE LADY'S MAID AT THE CHASE HAS SHOWN HER IN MISS LYDIA'S WARDROBE
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE WELL YOUR REVERENCE I'M NOT FOR TAKIN ANY MEASURES AGAIN THE YOUNG WOMAN
AND YOU MAKE LIGHT OF IT
THE FOLKS AT SNOWFIELD HAVE LEARNT BY THIS TIME TO DO BETTER WI'OUT YOU NOR SHE CAN I'LL PUT MY BONNET ON AND SET OFF DIRECTLY IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING DONE FIRST AUNT SAID DINAH FOLDING UP HER WORK
SO I TOOK TO GOING NOWHERE BUT TO CHURCH AND HEARING NOBODY BUT MR IRWINE FOR HE SAID NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS GOOD AND WHAT YOU'D BE THE WISER FOR REMEMBERING
HE AND HIS FATHER WERE SIMPLE-MINDED FARMERS PROUD OF THEIR UNTARNISHED CHARACTER PROUD THAT THEY CAME OF A FAMILY WHICH HAD HELD UP ITS HEAD AND PAID ITS WAY AS FAR BACK AS ITS NAME WAS IN THE PARISH REGISTER
IT'S ALL NONSENSE ABOUT THE FRENCH BEING SUCH POOR STICKS
I FOUND IT OUT FROM THE LAD THEY SENT TO TREDDLESTON FOR THE DOCTOR BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING
DEAR FRIENDS SHE BEGAN RAISING HER VOICE A LITTLE YOU HAVE ALL OF YOU BEEN TO CHURCH AND I THINK YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THE CLERGYMAN READ THESE WORDS
THE MOTHER AND SONS PASSED INTO THE CHURCH AND ONE BY ONE THE LOITERERS FOLLOWED THOUGH SOME STILL LINGERED WITHOUT
AND BARTLE MASSEY TOO WHO HAD PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES SEEMED TRANSFIXED EXAMINING DINAH'S FACE
HIS LAME WALK WAS RATHER SLOWER THAN USUAL ON THIS WARM DAY SO ADAM LINGERED BEHIND WHEN THE BELL RANG FOR DINNER THAT HE MIGHT WALK UP WITH HIS OLD FRIEND
SHE CAN'T LEAVE MISS ANNE OH VERY WELL
ONLY DON'T SET YOUR HEART TOO STRONGLY ON THE GOODWILL YOU ARE TO GET IN CONSEQUENCE
TALK O LEGS THERE'S LEGS FOR YOU MRS POYSER CONTINUED AS TOTTY WHO HAD BEEN SET DOWN NOW THE ROAD WAS DRY TODDLED ON IN FRONT OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER
AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT I THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL FOR IT'LL BE THE SMALLEST SAVIN Y IVER MADE WI ALL YOUR SCRAPIN THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT-GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY AND NANCY AND TIM WERE GRINNING NOT FAR FROM HIM
MOTHER WHAT'S DINAH CRYING FOR SAID TOTTY
THE LETTER SHOULD BE WRITTEN THE FIRST THING AND THE REST OF THE DAY WOULD BE FILLED UP WITH OTHER BUSINESS
I THOUGHT IT WAS WORSE WHAT
BUT I HAD HARD WORK TO TELL WHICH WAY IT CAME FROM AND FOR A GOOD WHILE I KEPT LOOKING UP AT THE BOUGHS
WHEN YOU HAVE PUT YOUR MOUTH TO ONE END OF A HOLE IN A STONE WALL AND ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTANT EAR AT THE OTHER END YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY WHAT YOU CAME OUT WITH THE INTENTION OF SAYING THAN IF YOU WERE SEATED WITH YOUR LEGS IN AN EASY ATTITUDE UNDER THE MAHOGANY WITH A COMPANION WHO WILL HAVE NO REASON TO BE SURPRISED IF YOU HAVE NOTHING PARTICULAR TO SAY
BUT A VOICE CAUGHT HIS EAR
NEVERTHELESS TO SPEAK PARADOXICALLY THE EXISTENCE OF INSIGNIFICANT PEOPLE HAS VERY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES IN THE WORLD
THE GLASS STICKS AT CHANGE AND YE MAY RELY UPO MY WORD AS WE'LL HA MORE DOWNFALL AFORE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS IS PAST
OF COURSE THE SECRET OF HER OBJECTION TO THE BEST CLOTHES WAS HER SUSPICION THAT THEY WERE PUT ON FOR HETTY'S SAKE
HE MADE NO ANSWER TO SETH BUT RAN FORWARD PRECEDED BY GYP WHO BEGAN TO BARK UNEASILY
HAVE YE COME FROM YOUR OWN COUNTRY O PURPOSE TO SEE HER BUT HETTY--HETTY SORREL SAID ADAM ABRUPTLY
THAT IS A THOUGHT WHICH MIGHT COMFORT US A LITTLE UNDER THE OPPOSITE FACT--THAT IT IS BETTER SOMETIMES NOT TO FOLLOW GREAT REFORMERS OF ABUSES BEYOND THE THRESHOLD OF THEIR HOMES
THAT MEANS JUST LIKE GOD WHO IS THE BEGINNING AND END OF ALL THINGS--THE GOD WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT
IT WAS A CONVERSATIONAL OPPORTUNITY
BUT WHEN HE HAD PARTLY SOLVED IT BY TAKING HIS HANDS OUT OF HIS POCKETS AND THRUSTING THEM INTO THE ARMHOLES OF HIS WAISTCOAT BY THROWING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND PROVIDING HIMSELF WITH AN AIR OF CONTEMPTUOUS INDIFFERENCE TO WHATEVER MIGHT FALL UNDER HIS NOTICE HIS THOUGHTS WERE DIVERTED BY THE APPROACH OF THE HORSEMAN WHOM WE LATELY SAW PAUSING TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT OUR FRIEND ADAM AND WHO NOW PULLED UP AT THE DOOR OF THE DONNITHORNE ARMS
I MIGHT MENTION ALL THE DIVINE CHARMS OF A BRIGHT SPRING DAY BUT IF YOU HAD NEVER IN YOUR LIFE UTTERLY FORGOTTEN YOURSELF IN STRAINING YOUR EYES AFTER THE MOUNTING LARK OR IN WANDERING THROUGH THE STILL LANES WHEN THE FRESH-OPENED BLOSSOMS FILL THEM WITH A SACRED SILENT BEAUTY LIKE THAT OF FRETTED AISLES WHERE WOULD BE THE USE OF MY DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE
AT ANY PREVIOUS MOMENT IN HER LIFE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IT BUT NOW THE NEW SUSCEPTIBILITY THAT SUFFERING HAD AWAKENED IN HER CAUSED THIS OBJECT TO IMPRESS HER STRONGLY
I ENVY THEM ALL THE SIGHT THEY HAD WHEN THE MARRIAGE WAS FAIRLY ENDED AND ADAM LED DINAH OUT OF CHURCH
YOU'RE LIKE THE BIRDS O TH AIR AND LIVE NOBODY KNOWS HOW
THY EYES FOLLOW HER ABOUT WELLY AS GYP'S FOLLOW THEE ADAM COULD SIT STILL NO LONGER
THE WOODS ARE ALL ONE DARK MONOTONOUS GREEN
HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM HETTY'S WAIST AND SAID HERE WE ARE ALMOST AT THE END OF THE GROVE
GO GYP
OH THAT THE GOOD SEED MIGHT FALL ON THAT SOIL FOR IT WOULD SURELY FLOURISH THE AGREEABLE IMPRESSION MUST HAVE BEEN MUTUAL FOR MR IRWINE BOWED TO HER WITH A BENIGNANT DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY IN PLACE IF SHE HAD BEEN THE MOST DIGNIFIED LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE
IF I CAN HELP TO MEND ANYTHING I WILL
ALREADY ARTHUR WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW-SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF
THE LADS ARENA LIKE TO GET FOLKS AS LL MAKE THEIR PARRIDGE AS I'N MADE IT FOR EM
WELL IF THE METHODIES ARE FOND O TROUBLE THEY'RE LIKE TO THRIVE
IF YOU'RE TO KNOW FIGURES YOU MUST TURN EM OVER IN YOUR HEADS AND KEEP YOUR THOUGHTS FIXED ON EM
STRANGE HOW LONG THIS SORT OF INFLUENCE LASTS FOR HE WAS CERTAINLY NOT IN LOVE WITH HETTY NOW
WHILE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WERE BEING BUZZED ABOUT MINGLED WITH WONDERINGS AS TO WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANT TO DO FOR A BAILIFF AND WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A STEWARD THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD RISEN AND WERE WALKING ROUND TO THE TABLE WHERE THE WIVES AND CHILDREN SAT
HETTY SEEMED UNHAPPY SOMETIMES
I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL REASON TO LOVE HIM BUT NO ONE OF HIS PARISHIONERS HAS SO MUCH REASON AS I
ALL PASSION BECOMES STRENGTH WHEN IT HAS AN OUTLET FROM THE NARROW LIMITS OF OUR PERSONAL LOT IN THE LABOUR OF OUR RIGHT ARM THE CUNNING OF OUR RIGHT HAND OR THE STILL CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF OUR THOUGHT
IF ANY SOUND WERE HEARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE SOUND OF BEATING HEARTS
AND THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN SO FAR DOWN THIS SIDE OF THE HILL FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WERE BEING BROUGHT FROM BROXTON AND HAYSLOPE IN ONE OF THE FARMER'S WAGGONS AT MR IRWINE'S SUGGESTION
AND I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS MY GRANDFATHER'S WISH TOO AND IT IS NOW SETTLED THAT ADAM SHALL MANAGE THE WOODS--A CHANGE WHICH I AM SURE WILL BE VERY MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ESTATE
WHILE THE TWO PUPPIES REGARDING MR RANN'S PROMINENT CALF AND RIBBED WORSTED STOCKINGS FROM A MORE SENSUOUS POINT OF VIEW PLUNGED AND GROWLED OVER THEM IN GREAT ENJOYMENT
BUT DO NOT IMPOSE ON US ANY AESTHETIC RULES WHICH SHALL BANISH FROM THE REGION OF ART THOSE OLD WOMEN SCRAPING CARROTS WITH THEIR WORK-WORN HANDS THOSE HEAVY CLOWNS TAKING HOLIDAY IN A DINGY POT-HOUSE THOSE ROUNDED BACKS AND STUPID WEATHER-BEATEN FACES THAT HAVE BENT OVER THE SPADE AND DONE THE ROUGH WORK OF THE WORLD--THOSE HOMES WITH THEIR TIN PANS THEIR BROWN PITCHERS THEIR ROUGH CURS AND THEIR CLUSTERS OF ONIONS
AND THE LOVER HIMSELF THINKS SO TOO
HIS SHOES WILL BE DIRTY BUT SEE THAT HE WIPES THEM CARROLL IN TWO MINUTES MR RANN APPEARED AT THE DOOR WITH VERY DEFERENTIAL BOWS WHICH HOWEVER WERE FAR FROM CONCILIATING PUG WHO GAVE A SHARP BARK AND RAN ACROSS THE ROOM TO RECONNOITRE THE STRANGER'S LEGS
BUT IT SEEMS A LAW OF NATURE THAT SHE SHOULD BE DRESSED SO
AND ADAM WHEN HE CAME IN THE EVENING SAID IF HETTY COULD SET OFF TO-MORROW HE WOULD MAKE TIME TO GO WITH HER TO TREDDLESTON AND SEE HER SAFE INTO THE STONITON COACH
BUT I AM NOT SURE OF THAT
CHAPTER II THE PREACHING ABOUT A QUARTER TO SEVEN THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL APPEARANCE OF EXCITEMENT IN THE VILLAGE OF HAYSLOPE AND THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF ITS LITTLE STREET FROM THE DONNITHORNE ARMS TO THE CHURCHYARD GATE THE INHABITANTS HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN DRAWN OUT OF THEIR HOUSES BY SOMETHING MORE THAN THE PLEASURE OF LOUNGING IN THE EVENING SUNSHINE
IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG
WHY WHAT PLACE IS'T SHE'S AT DO THEY SAY IT'S A GOOD WAY OFF MOTHER--LEEDS A BIG TOWN
THAT WHILE HE HAD BEEN ROCKING HIMSELF IN THE HOPE THAT SHE WOULD COME TO LOVE HIM SHE WAS ALREADY LOVING ANOTHER
BUT HE HAD DONE THE EXTRA WORK CHEERFULLY FOR HIS HOPES WERE BUOYANT AGAIN ABOUT HETTY
AND SINCE HIS WIFE DID NOT GO TO CHURCH MR POYSER CONSIDERED THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WOULD BE AS WELL FOR HIM TO STAY AWAY TOO AND KEEP HER COMPANY HE COULD PERHAPS HAVE GIVEN NO PRECISE FORM TO THE REASONS THAT DETERMINED THIS CONCLUSION BUT IT IS WELL KNOWN TO ALL EXPERIENCED MINDS THAT OUR FIRMEST CONVICTIONS ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT ON SUBTLE IMPRESSIONS FOR WHICH WORDS ARE QUITE TOO COARSE A MEDIUM
AND I COULD HEAR IT CRYING AT EVERY STEP....I THOUGHT IT WAS ALIVE....I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS FRIGHTENED OR GLAD...I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FELT
THE DRAMA THAT WAS GOING ON WAS ALMOST AS FAMILIAR AS THE SCENE NEVERTHELESS HABIT HAD NOT MADE HIM INDIFFERENT TO IT AND EVEN IN HIS PRESENT SELF-ABSORBED MOOD ADAM FELT A MOMENTARY STIRRING OF THE OLD FELLOW-FEELING AS HE LOOKED AT THE ROUGH MEN PAINFULLY HOLDING PEN OR PENCIL WITH THEIR CRAMPED HANDS OR HUMBLY LABOURING THROUGH THEIR READING LESSON
HIS PARDONING MERCY CAN'T REACH YOU UNTIL YOU OPEN YOUR HEART TO HIM AND SAY I HAVE DONE THIS GREAT WICKEDNESS
LISBETH LOOKED EARNESTLY AT THE HAND FOR A MOMENT AND THEN FIXING HER EYES AGAIN ON DINAH'S FACE SAID WITH SOMETHING OF RESTORED COURAGE BUT IN A TONE OF SURPRISE WHY YE'RE A WORKIN WOMAN YES I AM DINAH MORRIS AND I WORK IN THE COTTON-MILL WHEN I AM AT HOME AH SAID LISBETH SLOWLY STILL WONDERING
IT'S AMAZING WHAT ENERGY HE HAS THOUGH WELL WE'LL GO TO THE LADIES NOW SAID MR IRWINE RISING TOO
BUT WHAT HARM COULD HE DO BY GOING TO SNOWFIELD
TOUGH WORK AS HIS FIRST SPEECH HAD BEEN HE WOULD HAVE STARTED UP TO MAKE ANOTHER IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THE EXTREME IRREGULARITY OF SUCH A COURSE
HE SAW SO FAR BEYOND THE MERE FACTS OF A CASE THAT REALLY IT WAS SUPERFLUOUS TO KNOW THEM
DEAR FRIENDS COME AND TAKE THIS BLESSEDNESS
IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST
ANYBODY MIGHT AS WELL SET A PICTUR TO WATCH THE CHILDREN AS YOU
AS FOR THE PAIN IT HAS GIVEN YOU I'M HEARTILY SORRY FOR IT
HIS EYE SOON DETECTED A DISTANT GROUP WHICH HE KNEW TO BE THE RIGHT ONE RETURNING TO THE HOUSE ALONG THE BROAD GRAVEL ROAD AND HE HASTENED ON TO MEET THEM
ENERGETIC NATURES STRONG FOR ALL STRENUOUS DEEDS WILL OFTEN RUSH AWAY FROM A HOPELESS SUFFERER AS IF THEY WERE HARD-HEARTED
THEE COULDSTNA PUT UP WI SETH SHE SAID
I ONLY WISH TO ASK YOU IF YOU WILL HELP ME TO LESSEN THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF THE PAST WHICH IS UNCHANGEABLE
AND THE MEN THAT HELP EM TO DO MISCHIEF HAD BETTER GO ALONG WITH EM FOR THAT MATTER
AN HIM TO BE DROWNDED IN THE BROOK AS WE PASSED O'ER THE DAY WE WAR MARRIED AN COME HOME TOGETHER AN HE'D MADE THEM LOTS O SHELVES FOR ME TO PUT MY PLATES AN THINGS ON AN SHOWED EM ME AS PROUD AS COULD BE CAUSE HE KNOW'D I SHOULD BE PLEASED
HIS HAIR WAS TOSSED SHAGGILY ABOUT HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS CLOSED EYES HAD THE SUNKEN LOOK WHICH FOLLOWS UPON WATCHING AND SORROW
THAT FEELING IS HIS VALUE AND RESPECT FOR ADAM BEDE
I SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE CHURCH RELIGION IS WELL WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE JOSHUA
IT WAS TOO FOOLISH
WHAT DO YOU SEE
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME AND THAT'S A POOR SORT O LIFE WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT THAN WHAT YOU'VE GOT INSIDE YOU A'READY IT WAS MORE THAN TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL-SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL
NEVERTHELESS THE JOY OF BEING WITH DINAH WOULD TRIUMPH--IT WAS LIKE THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE WHICH NO RESISTANCE CAN OVERCOME
MR RYDE WAS A DEAL THOUGHT ON AT A DISTANCE I BELIEVE AND HE WROTE BOOKS BUT AS FOR MATH'MATICS AND THE NATUR O THINGS HE WAS AS IGNORANT AS A WOMAN
IT STRUCK ME ON ARTHUR'S BIRTHDAY THAT THE OLD MAN WAS A LITTLE SHAKEN
BUT HE'S GOT NO NOTION ABOUT BUILDINGS
NAY I FEAR I SHOULD FORGET THE DIVINE PRESENCE AND SEEK NO LOVE BUT YOURS ADAM DID NOT SPEAK IMMEDIATELY
AND PERHAPS THE TIME WAS COME FOR SOME OF THAT BITTERNESS TO RISE
MR IRWINE WAS TO BE TRUSTED
DINAH MADE NO ANSWER BUT SHE PRESENTLY SAID HAVE YOU HEARD ANY NEWS FROM THAT POOR YOUNG MAN SINCE WE LAST SPOKE OF HIM DINAH ALWAYS CALLED ARTHUR SO
THE INTENSE JOY THAT FLOODED HIS SOUL BROUGHT BACK SOME OF THE OLD AFFECTION WITH IT
WHY POYSERS MAKE AS BIG A FUSS WI ADAM BEDE AS IF HE WAR A NEVVY O THEIR OWN IDLE TALK
WE MUST MAKE HASTE IN NOW ELSE THE SQUIRE AND THE LADIES ULL BE IN AFORE US AN THAT WOULDNA LOOK WELL WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED THE HALL AND THE THREE CHILDREN UNDER MOLLY'S CHARGE HAD BEEN SEATED ON THE STAIRS THE FOLDING-DOORS OF THE DRAWING-ROOM WERE THROWN OPEN AND ARTHUR ENTERED IN HIS REGIMENTALS LEADING MRS IRWINE TO A CARPET-COVERED DAIS ORNAMENTED WITH HOT-HOUSE PLANTS WHERE SHE AND MISS ANNE WERE TO BE SEATED WITH OLD MR DONNITHORNE THAT THEY MIGHT LOOK ON AT THE DANCING LIKE THE KINGS AND QUEENS IN THE PLAYS
SET HER DOWN--FOR SHAME NAY NAY SAID ADAM I CAN LIFT HER WITH MY HAND--I'VE NO NEED TO TAKE MY ARM TO IT TOTTY LOOKING AS SERENELY UNCONSCIOUS OF REMARK AS A FAT WHITE PUPPY WAS SET DOWN AT THE DOOR-PLACE AND THE MOTHER ENFORCED HER REPROOF WITH A SHOWER OF KISSES
I ENTREAT YOU SIR FOR THE LOVE OF OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO LET ME GO TO HER AND STAY WITH HER HOW DID YOU KNOW SHE WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH IF YOU ARE ONLY JUST COME FROM LEEDS I HAVE SEEN MY UNCLE SINCE THE TRIAL SIR
AND I THINK YOU AND I POYSER AND YOUR EXCELLENT WIFE HERE CAN ENTER INTO A LITTLE ARRANGEMENT IN CONSEQUENCE WHICH WILL BE TO OUR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OH SAID MR POYSER WITH A GOOD-NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT
ANYBODY UD BE CUNNING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU I THINK
THE WHOLE PARTY WAS ASSEMBLED IN THE HOUSE-PLACE WHEN HETTY WENT DOWN ALL OF COURSE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES
MY GRANDFATHER HAS COME ROUND AFTER ALL WHAT ABOUT ADAM YES
WHY WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FOLKS HERE SAYS FOR HEVN'T YOU?'--THE GENTRY YOU KNOW SAYS HEVN'T YOU'--WELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT HERE SAYS HANNA YEY IT'S WHAT THEY CALL THE DILECK AS IS SPOKE HEREABOUT SIR
LET ME TAKE YOU IN NOW THAT YOU MAY REST TILL DINNER MISS ANNE ROSE ASSENTINGLY AND THE GOOD BROTHER TOOK HER AWAY WHILE JOSHUA'S PRELIMINARY SCRAPINGS BURST INTO THE WHITE COCKADE FROM WHICH HE INTENDED TO PASS TO A VARIETY OF TUNES BY A SERIES OF TRANSITIONS WHICH HIS GOOD EAR REALLY TAUGHT HIM TO EXECUTE WITH SOME SKILL
ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH AND WHEN THAT SORT OF HUNGER REACHES A CERTAIN STAGE A LOVER IS LIKELY TO STILL IT THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIS FUTURE IN PAWN
AN I RECKON YOU COULD EAT A BIT DINAH FOR THEY DON'T KEEP MUCH OF A HOUSE DOWN THERE NO THANK YOU UNCLE SAID DINAH
IF GYP HAD HAD A TAIL HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE WAGGED IT BUT BEING DESTITUTE OF THAT VEHICLE FOR HIS EMOTIONS HE WAS LIKE MANY OTHER WORTHY PERSONAGES DESTINED TO APPEAR MORE PHLEGMATIC THAN NATURE HAD MADE HIM
WHAT I CAME FOR ADAM BEDE WAS TO PRAY YOU TO GO AND SEE THE POOR SINNER AND BID HER FAREWELL
I HOPE I SEE YOU AN MRS IRWINE WELL AN MISS IRWINE--AN MISS ANNE I HOPE'S AS WELL AS USUAL YES JOSHUA THANK YOU
SETH PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED UP WITH A SLIGHT BLUSH AT HIS MOTHER'S FACE
FOR THOSE WERE TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO RIGID DEMARCATION OF RANK BETWEEN THE FARMER AND THE RESPECTABLE ARTISAN AND ON THE HOME HEARTH AS WELL AS IN THE PUBLIC HOUSE THEY MIGHT BE SEEN TAKING THEIR JUG OF ALE TOGETHER
I'LL CALL THEE UP AT SUNRISE
THE MINUTE-HAND WAS HURRYING ALONG THE LAST FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WITH A LOUD HARD INDIFFERENT TICK AND ADAM WATCHED THE MOVEMENT AND LISTENED TO THE SOUND AS IF HE HAD HAD SOME REASON FOR DOING SO
BUT THE INNKEEPER SEEING THAT ADAM WAS IN GREAT ANXIETY AND ENTERING INTO THIS NEW INCIDENT WITH THE EAGERNESS OF A MAN WHO PASSES A GREAT DEAL OF TIME WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING INTO AN OBSTINATELY MONOTONOUS STREET OFFERED TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OAKBOURNE IN HIS OWN TAXED CART THIS VERY EVENING
AND WHEN ADAM REACHED THE HOUSE-DOOR WHICH STOOD WIDE OPEN HE SAW THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE BRIGHT CLEAN HOUSE-PLACE
AND THE FINEST LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IS CHIEFLY MADE UP OF UNIMPOSING WORDS SUCH AS LIGHT SOUND STARS MUSIC"--WORDS REALLY NOT WORTH LOOKING AT OR HEARING IN THEMSELVES ANY MORE THAN CHIPS OR SAWDUST IT IS ONLY THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE THE SIGNS OF SOMETHING UNSPEAKABLY GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL
THANK GOD FOR THAT AS THE WEEKS WENT BY AND HE SAW HER ALWAYS LOOKING PLEASED TO SEE HIM--TURNING UP HER LOVELY FACE TOWARDS HIM AS IF SHE MEANT HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS GLAD FOR HIM TO COME--AND GOING ABOUT HER WORK IN THE SAME EQUABLE WAY MAKING NO SIGN OF SORROW HE BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT HER FEELING TOWARDS ARTHUR MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH SLIGHTER THAN HE HAD IMAGINED IN HIS FIRST INDIGNATION AND ALARM AND THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO THINK OF HER GIRLISH FANCY THAT ARTHUR WAS IN LOVE WITH HER AND WOULD MARRY HER AS A FOLLY OF WHICH SHE WAS TIMELY CURED
THEY'RE ALWAYS EITHER A-BUZZ OR A-SQUEAK--ALWAYS EITHER A-BUZZ OR A-SQUEAK
MRS POYSER THEN LED THE WAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN FOLLOWED BY THE GRANDFATHER AND DINAH WITH TOTTY IN HER ARMS--ALL GOING TO BED BY TWILIGHT LIKE THE BIRDS
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS ARTICLE IN HER ATTIRE WAS AN AMPLE CHECKERED LINEN APRON WHICH ALMOST COVERED HER SKIRT
ARE YOU GOING TO DISGRACE YOUR SCHOOLMASTER IN HIS OLD AGE NO MR MASSEY SAID ADAM
ANY OTHER WORDS THAT I COULD WRITE AT THIS MOMENT MUST BE WEAK AND UNMEANING BY THE SIDE OF THOSE IN WHICH I MUST TELL YOU THE SIMPLE FACT
HETTY HAD TO MANAGE EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS AND HALF-SUPPLY MOLLY'S PLACE TOO WHILE THAT GOOD DAMSEL WAITED ON HER MISTRESS AND SHE SEEMED TO THROW HERSELF SO ENTIRELY INTO HER NEW FUNCTIONS WORKING WITH A GRAVE STEADINESS WHICH WAS NEW IN HER THAT MR POYSER OFTEN TOLD ADAM SHE WAS WANTING TO SHOW HIM WHAT A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER HE WOULD HAVE
YE'D NEED ARTER BEIN UPO YOUR LEGS THIS HOUR AN HALF A'READY
WHAT A MUCH PRETTIER VILLAGE HAYSLOPE WAS
SHE COULD PASS THE NIGHT THERE FOR THAT WAS WHAT ALICK DID AT HAYSLOPE IN LAMBING-TIME
THE BLOW SOON CAME AND ARTHUR FELL HIS HEAD LYING CONCEALED IN A TUFT OF FERN SO THAT ADAM COULD ONLY DISCERN HIS DARKLY CLAD BODY
I WANT T KNOW WHAT THEE WAS CRYIN ABOUT
AND TO ADAM THE CHURCH SERVICE WAS THE BEST CHANNEL HE COULD HAVE FOUND FOR HIS MINGLED REGRET YEARNING AND RESIGNATION
BUT HE'S AS STUBBORN AS TH IRON BAR--THERE'S NO BENDING HIM NO WAY BUT'S OWN
MR IRWINE PUT HIMSELF NEAR HIM AND WENT WITH HIM OUT O COURT
I MUST KNOW IT NOW--I MUST KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO BRING AGAINST HER WHY THE CHIEF EVIDENCE YET HAS BEEN THE DOCTORS
HE ACTUALLY DARED NOT LOOK AT THIS LITTLE BUTTER-MAKER FOR THE FIRST MINUTE OR TWO
I TELL YOU NOW AS I TOLD YOU TEN YEARS AGO WHEN YOU POMMELLED YOUNG MIKE HOLDSWORTH FOR WANTING TO PASS A BAD SHILLING BEFORE YOU KNEW WHETHER HE WAS IN JEST OR EARNEST--YOU'RE OVERHASTY AND PROUD AND APT TO SET YOUR TEETH AGAINST FOLKS THAT DON'T SQUARE TO YOUR NOTIONS
IF HETTY GETS MARRIED THEED'ST LIKE TO HA DINAH WI THEE CONSTANT IT'S NO USE THINKING O THAT SAID MRS POYSER
A LETTER WOULD BE A DREADFULLY ABRUPT WAY OF AWAKENING HER
IRWINE THINKS SO TOO
DINAH WAITED HOPING FOR A SPONTANEOUS WORD FROM HETTY BUT SHE SAT IN THE SAME DULL DESPAIR ONLY CLUTCHING THE HAND THAT HELD HERS AND LEANING HER CHEEK AGAINST DINAH'S
AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER-TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
LOVE IS SUCH A SIMPLE THING WHEN WE HAVE ONLY ONE-AND-TWENTY SUMMERS AND A SWEET GIRL OF SEVENTEEN TREMBLES UNDER OUR GLANCE AS IF SHE WERE A BUD FIRST OPENING HER HEART WITH WONDERING RAPTURE TO THE MORNING
HE HAD SHUT UP HIS SCHOOL AND WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE RECTORY WHERE HE ARRIVED ABOUT HALF-PAST SEVEN IN THE EVENING AND SENDING HIS DUTY TO MR IRWINE BEGGED PARDON FOR TROUBLING HIM AT THAT HOUR BUT HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR ON HIS MIND
HE THOUGHT HE COULD DO THAT BEST IN THE GROVE
I DON'T BELIEVE I CAN WALK ALONE LEAN ON ME SIR
AND I WALKED ON AND ON AND I HARDLY FELT THE GROUND I TROD ON
BUT AS I PASSED ALONG BY THE COTTAGES AND SAW THE AGED AND TREMBLING WOMEN AT THE DOORS AND THE HARD LOOKS OF THE MEN WHO SEEMED TO HAVE THEIR EYES NO MORE FILLED WITH THE SIGHT OF THE SABBATH MORNING THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN DUMB OXEN THAT NEVER LOOKED UP TO THE SKY I FELT A GREAT MOVEMENT IN MY SOUL AND I TREMBLED AS IF I WAS SHAKEN BY A STRONG SPIRIT ENTERING INTO MY WEAK BODY
SHE WAS QUITE WELCOME
EVEN NOW AN AUCTIONEER COULD SAY SOMETHING FOR IT
BUT A HAPPY TIME NEVERTHELESS FOR IT WAS TAKING HIM NEARER AND NEARER TO MARCH WHEN THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND ALL THE LITTLE PREPARATIONS FOR THEIR NEW HOUSEKEEPING MARKED THE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE LONGED-FOR DAY
BUT SHE CANNOT KEEP IN THE EAR-RINGS LONG ELSE SHE MAY MAKE HER UNCLE AND AUNT WAIT
HETTY WITHOUT ANY DISTINCT THOUGHT OF IT HUNG ON THIS SOMETHING THAT WAS COME TO CLASP HER NOW WHILE SHE WAS SINKING HELPLESS IN A DARK GULF
I WANT ALL THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN ON THE ESTATE TO BE THERE--ALL THOSE WHO WILL BE FINE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHEN I'M A BALD OLD FELLOW OH DEAR SIR THAT ULL BE A LONG TIME FIRST SAID MRS POYSER QUITE OVERCOME AT THE YOUNG SQUIRE'S SPEAKING SO LIGHTLY OF HIMSELF AND THINKING HOW HER HUSBAND WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING HER RECOUNT THIS REMARKABLE SPECIMEN OF HIGH-BORN HUMOUR
POYSER'S WIFE MAY TURN HER NOSE UP AN FORGET BYGONES BUT THIS DINAH MORRIS THEY TELL ME S AS POOR AS IVER SHE WAS--WORKS AT A MILL AN'S MUCH ADO TO KEEP HERSEN
WAS IT SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE DISTANT UNHAPPY ONES THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW
BUT ALL TOOK CARE NOT TO JOIN THE METHODISTS ON THE GREEN AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES IN THAT WAY WITH THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM THAT WOULD NOT HAVE DISCLAIMED THE IMPUTATION OF HAVING COME OUT TO HEAR THE PREACHER WOMAN"--THEY HAD ONLY COME OUT TO SEE WHAT WAR A-GOIN ON LIKE THE MEN WERE CHIEFLY GATHERED IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP
SHE HADN'T CRIED OR SEEMED LOW AT ALL AS SHE DID THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOU'D A DEAL BETTER GETHER EM AFORE THEY'RE O'ERRIPE WI SUCH WEATHER AS WE'VE GOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO
YOU KNOW QUITE WELL THAT ADAM WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT HER
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SURE YOU WOULD TURN OUT A DONNITHORNE
LOR BLESS YOU HE SEES NO MORE THROUGH BONY!...WHY I PUT HIM UP TO MORE IN THREE MINUTES THAN HE GETS FROM'S PAPER ALL THE YEAR ROUND
IT'S THEM NASTY GLAZED HANDLES--THEY SLIP O'ER THE FINGER LIKE A SNAIL WHY THEE'ST LET THY OWN WHIP FLY I THY FACE SAID HER HUSBAND WHO HAD NOW JOINED IN THE LAUGH OF THE YOUNG ONES
BUT YOU SEEM TO MAKE LIGHT O WHAT SHE MAY FEEL--YOU DON'T THINK O THAT GOOD GOD ADAM LET ME ALONE ARTHUR BURST OUT IMPETUOUSLY
IT'S SHUT UP--BEEN SHUT UP THIS FORTNIGHT
DINAH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE FELT A PAINFUL SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
AND WROTE A BEAUTIFUL HAND THAT YOU COULD READ OFF AND COULD DO FIGURES IN HIS HEAD--A DEGREE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TOTALLY UNKNOWN AMONG THE RICHEST FARMERS OF THAT COUNTRYSIDE
TO THINK OF A GELL O YOUR AGE WANTING TO GO AND SIT WITH HALF-A-DOZEN MEN
SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO
KESTER WAS AN OLD BACHELOR AND REPUTED TO HAVE STOCKINGS FULL OF COIN CONCERNING WHICH HIS MASTER CRACKED A JOKE WITH HIM EVERY PAY-NIGHT
SUNDAY MORNING WAS THE HAPPIEST TIME IN ALL THE WEEK TO LISBETH FOR AS THERE WAS NO SERVICE AT HAYSLOPE CHURCH TILL THE AFTERNOON ADAM WAS ALWAYS AT HOME DOING NOTHING BUT READING AN OCCUPATION IN WHICH SHE COULD VENTURE TO INTERRUPT HIM
AWAY FROM THE FAMILIAR TO THE STRANGE
BUT HE WAS IN REALITY CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING BUT THE CONFLICT WITHIN HIM
HETTY FELT THAT NO ONE COULD DELIVER HER FROM THE EVILS THAT WOULD MAKE LIFE HATEFUL TO HER
THERE WAS NO PROBABILITY THAT ARTHUR EVER SAW HER EXCEPT AT CHURCH AND AT HER OWN HOME UNDER THE EYE OF MRS POYSER
I DONNA WANT TO SET EYES ON THE WHITTAWS AGAIN
PERHAPS IT CAME BECAUSE HER UNCLE WAS LOOKING AT HER SO FIXEDLY
BUT I CAN STAY HERE ALL TO-DAY IF YOUR MOTHER WOULD LIKE ME
SOME S GOT ONE WAY O LOOKING AT THINGS AND SOME S GOT ANOTHER NAY NAY ADDY THEE MEAN'ST ME NO UNKINDNESS SAID SETH I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH
IT UD BE NONSENSE FOR ME TO BE SAYING I DON'T AT ALL DESERVE TH OPINION YOU HAVE OF ME
ALL CAUTION WAS SWEPT AWAY--ALL REASON FOR IT WAS GONE AND ADAM COULD FEEL NOTHING BUT TREMBLING JOY
THE SUNSHINE WAS ON THEM
I'D MAKE HER LIFE A HAPPY UN IF A STRONG ARM TO WORK FOR HER AND A HEART TO LOVE HER COULD DO IT AND THEN THERE STOLE OVER HIM DELICIOUS THOUGHTS OF COMING HOME FROM WORK AND DRAWING HETTY TO HIS SIDE AND FEELING HER CHEEK SOFTLY PRESSED AGAINST HIS TILL HE FORGOT WHERE HE WAS AND THE MUSIC AND THE TREAD OF FEET MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE FALLING OF RAIN AND THE ROARING OF THE WIND FOR WHAT HE KNEW
AND HIS PREACHING WOULDN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH THAT SAUCE
I SHALL THINK OF YOU JUST AS MUCH AS I DO NOW FOR YOU'RE BOUND UP WITH WHAT I CAN NO MORE HELP REMEMBERING THAN I CAN HELP MY HEART BEATING POOR ADAM
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE COMES TO AN END AND WHEN WE DIE WE LEAVE IT ALL
BUT IF YOU ARE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THERE IS ANY DANGER IN IT--I'M GOING AWAY ON SATURDAY AND THERE WILL BE AN END OF IT
HAD HETTY A LOVER HE DIDN'T KNOW OF
MELT THE HARD HEART
BUT NOW THE THIRD DANCE WAS ENDED AND HE MIGHT GO UP TO HER AND CLAIM HER HAND
A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN I THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON
I SHOULD HA THOUGHT THERE WASNA SO MANY PEOPLE I THE TWO PARISHES
BUT WHO IS THAT PRETTY GIRL WITH DARK EYES THAT IS HETTY SORREL SAID MISS LYDIA DONNITHORNE MARTIN POYSER'S NIECE--A VERY LIKELY YOUNG PERSON AND WELL-LOOKING TOO
I SHALL HAVE ASCERTAINED THINGS THEN WHICH I AM UNCERTAIN ABOUT NOW AND I SHALL RETURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THOSE ARTHUR HAD GIVEN HER MUST HAVE COST A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THESE PEOPLE AT THE INN TO KNOW ABOUT HER TO KNOW THAT SHE HAD COME TO LOOK FOR CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE
MRS POYSER KEEPS AT THE TOP O THE TALK LIKE A FIFE
LORD BLESS YOU
MERCY ON US
WE WILL ENTER VERY SOFTLY AND STAND STILL IN THE OPEN DOORWAY WITHOUT AWAKING THE GLOSSY-BROWN SETTER WHO IS STRETCHED ACROSS THE HEARTH WITH HER TWO PUPPIES BESIDE HER
A POOR SOFT THING WI NO MORE HEAD-PIECE NOR A SPARROW
PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE HAD FIXED HER MIND ON THE GRASSY WARWICKSHIRE FIELDS WITH THE BUSHY TREE-STUDDED HEDGEROWS THAT MADE A HIDING-PLACE EVEN IN THIS LEAFLESS SEASON
AND YET THE WIND SEEMED ONLY PART OF THE GENERAL GLADNESS BECAUSE THE SUN WAS SHINING
ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK--WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT
MOTHER'S MADE ME AS I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM WITH WHAT SHE'S BEEN SAYING TO ME THIS FORENOON
HE WILL ONLY HAVE HIS MOTHER TO KEEP IN FUTURE AND I'VE A NOTION THAT THERE'S A KINDNESS BETWEEN HIM AND THAT NICE MODEST GIRL MARY BURGE FROM SOMETHING THAT FELL FROM OLD JONATHAN ONE DAY WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HIM
SHE WOULD GO AWAY FROM WINDSOR--TRAVEL AGAIN AS SHE HAD DONE THE LAST WEEK AND GET AMONG THE FLAT GREEN FIELDS WITH THE HIGH HEDGES ROUND THEM WHERE NOBODY COULD SEE HER OR KNOW HER
IF I SAY ANYTHING TO PAIN YOU IN THIS LETTER DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS FOR WANT OF LOVE AND TENDERNESS TOWARDS YOU FOR THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD NOT DO FOR YOU IF I KNEW IT TO BE REALLY FOR YOUR HAPPINESS
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU DINAH
SHE'LL MAKE A WIFE AS MOTHER'LL HAVE NO OCCASION TO GRUMBLE AT AFTER ALL TO BE SURE HE HAD ONLY SEEN HER AT HOME TWICE SINCE THE BIRTHDAY
THE MILD RADIANCE OF A SMILE WAS A RARE SIGHT ON A FIELD-LABOURER'S FACE AND THERE WAS SELDOM ANY GRADATION BETWEEN BOVINE GRAVITY AND A LAUGH
THAT MUST BE OLD MR DONNITHORNE--HE ALWAYS CAME FIRST THE WRINKLED SMALL OLD MAN PEERING ROUND WITH SHORT-SIGHTED GLANCES AT THE BOWING AND CURTSYING CONGREGATION
HE MIGHT BE IN TUNE IF HE LIKED TO BE SINGULAR BUT HE MUST NOT SIT WITH CLOSED LIPS
IT WAS THE NOON OF THAT MORNING
THE KITCHEN HAD HAD NONE OF HER ATTENTION THAT DAY
I USED TO FIGHT FOR FUN BUT I'VE NEVER DONE THAT SINCE I WAS THE CAUSE O POOR GIL TRANTER BEING LAID UP FOR A FORTNIGHT
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEM GRASSHOPPERS ARE TO DO AGAINST SUCH FINE FELLOWS AS OUR YOUNG CAPTAIN ARTHUR
I SHOULD LIKE IT--I SHOULD LIKE IT BETTER THAN FARM-WORK NAY NAY
I AM OF OPINION THAT LOVE IS A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL THING TOO AND IF YOU AGREE WITH ME THE SMALLEST SIGNS OF IT WILL NOT BE CHIPS AND SAWDUST TO YOU
AND ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE GOT I THE WORLD I VERILY BELIEVE UD GO INTO A BUNDLE NO BIGGER NOR A DOUBLE CHEESE
BUT SHE'S ONE AS MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM RIGHT SHE SAYS AND DOES AND I SEEMED TO SEE HER AND HEAR HER SPEAKING WHEN I READ THE LETTER
YES AND THE BIBLE TOO FOR THAT MATTER MRS POYSER REJOINED RATHER SHARPLY
BUT WE HAVE ROOM TO HOPE THAT SHE DID NOT REALLY COMMIT IT
MY OWN AUNT MARRIED HER UNCLE MARTIN POYSER
NO IT WAS NOT A WOOD ONLY A WILD BRAKE WHERE THERE HAD ONCE BEEN GRAVEL-PITS LEAVING MOUNDS AND HOLLOWS STUDDED WITH BRUSHWOOD AND SMALL TREES
FOR GOD'S ALL-SEEING EYE SURVEYS THY SECRET THOUGHTS THY WORKS AND WAYS
YET THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF FAMILY LOVE AMONGST US
THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS SHONE THROUGH THE TRANSPARENT SHAVINGS THAT FLEW BEFORE THE STEADY PLANE AND LIT UP THE FINE GRAIN OF THE OAK PANELLING WHICH STOOD PROPPED AGAINST THE WALL
IF A MAN CAN ONLY GET UP THOUGH IT BE BUT TO WHISTLE OR TO SMOKE HE HAS A PRESENT WHICH OFFERS SOME RESISTANCE TO THE PAST--SENSATIONS WHICH ASSERT THEMSELVES AGAINST TYRANNOUS MEMORIES
WHAT'S PUT IT INTO THY HEAD IT'S NO MATTER WHAT'S PUT IT INTO MY HEAD
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS
I WOULDN'T LET HIM
PEOPLE WHO LOVE DOWNY PEACHES ARE APT NOT TO THINK OF THE STONE AND SOMETIMES JAR THEIR TEETH TERRIBLY AGAINST IT
THINGS ALLAYS HAPPEN SO CONTRAIRY IF THEY'VE A CHANCE
WAS THERE A WOMAN CONCERNED
YET HE IS NOT WEARY OF TOILING FOR YOU
HETTY HAD BECOME AWARE THAT MR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE WOULD TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER
I MUST DO IT SAID ADAM WHEN THESE THOUGHTS WHICH HAD SPREAD THEMSELVES THROUGH HOURS OF HIS SAD JOURNEYING NOW RUSHED UPON HIM IN AN INSTANT LIKE A WAVE THAT HAD BEEN SLOWLY GATHERING
SO SHE HANDLED IT WITH ALL THE GRACE THAT BELONGS TO MASTERY
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT YOU GIVE POYSER MANY A GOOD SERMON THE PARSON HAD THEE THERE MR POYSER ADDED LAUGHING UNCTUOUSLY
NAY HETTY SAID ADAM IF HE'D CARED FOR YOU RIGHTLY HE'D NEVER HA BEHAVED SO
NO SHE HAS NOT COURAGE TO JUMP INTO THAT COLD WATERY BED AND IF SHE HAD THEY MIGHT FIND HER--THEY MIGHT FIND OUT WHY SHE HAD DROWNED HERSELF
MOSES NEVER TOOK ANY HEED WHAT SORT OF BUSH IT WAS--HE ONLY SAW THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LORD
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT COULD LOOK BETTER THEE DOSTNA KNOW
I WANT TO KNOW IF THEE'ST SEEN ANYTHING IT'S A NICE POINT TO SPEAK ABOUT SAID SETH AND I'M AFRAID O BEING WRONG
SHE WAS SURE THERE WAS COMFORT IN THAT LETTER IN SPITE OF ADAM
ALICK'S BEEN COME IN THIS LONG WHILE SAID MRS POYSER RISING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF RELIEF FROM HER LOW CHAIR
DINAH DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THAT WORLD OF HETTY'S WHOSE GLANCE SHE DREADED LIKE SCORCHING FIRE
AND IT'S PRETTY TO SEE EM CARRYING THE LITTLE BABIES AS IF THEY WERE NO HEAVIER THAN LITTLE BIRDS
SHE COULD NOT DRAW THEM AWAY BECAUSE HE HELD THEM FAST
I DON'T MEAN CONSEQUENCES TO MYSELF BUT TO OTHERS
VIXEN COULD NOT EVEN SEE HER MASTER LOOK AT THEM WITHOUT PAINFUL EXCITEMENT
A SEAWORTHY VESSEL THAT NO ONE WOULD REFUSE TO INSURE
WHY AS ADAM HAS TO TAKE THOUGHT FOR THEE THOSE ARE THE WORDS O THE BIBLE MOTHER SAID SETH
BUT THE SOUND OF THE NEXT WITNESS'S VOICE TOUCHED A CHORD THAT WAS STILL SENSITIVE SHE GAVE A START AND A FRIGHTENED LOOK TOWARDS HIM BUT IMMEDIATELY TURNED AWAY HER HEAD AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS AS BEFORE
RIGHT BEFORE HIM WAS AN UNFINISHED CHEST OF DRAWERS WHICH HE HAD BEEN MAKING IN SPARE MOMENTS FOR HETTY'S USE WHEN HIS HOME SHOULD BE HERS
AND THE AGED PEASANT WOMAN MOST OF ALL BELIEVES THAT HER DEAD ARE CONSCIOUS
IT ONLY CREATES A VACUUM FOR EAGER THOUGHT TO RUSH IN
IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN WHO'S THE BACKBONE OF JONATHAN BURGE'S BUSINESS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORD MR MASSEY SAID ADAM
LIFE WAS NOT A TASK TO HIM BUT A SINECURE
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT
IT WAS A FLUSH NO DEEPER THAN THE PETAL OF A MONTHLY ROSE
AND YOU'VE BEEN KISSING HER AND MEANING NOTHING HAVE YOU
IF YOU WERE TO OBEY YOUR PASSION--FOR IT IS PASSION AND YOU DECEIVE YOURSELF IN CALLING IT JUSTICE--IT MIGHT BE WITH YOU PRECISELY AS IT HAS BEEN WITH ARTHUR
SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER ARMS
BUT IT MUST BE DONE--SHE MUST GET TO ARTHUR
COME COME NOW HE WENT ON BECOMING JOCOSE AS SOON AS HETTY HAD KISSED HER AUNT AND THE OLD MAN ADAM WANTS A KISS TOO I'LL WARRANT AND HE'S A RIGHT TO ONE NOW HETTY TURNED AWAY SMILING TOWARDS HER EMPTY CHAIR
WHAT IS TO BE BROKE WILL BE BROKE FOR I NEVER DROPPED A THING I MY LIFE FOR WANT O HOLDING IT ELSE I SHOULD NEVER HA KEPT THE CROCKERY ALL THESE EARS AS I BOUGHT AT MY OWN WEDDING
I ASK YOU TO WRITE A LETTER--YOU MAY TRUST TO MY SEEING AS SHE GETS IT
THE LONG-LOST MOTHER WHOSE FACE WE BEGIN TO SEE IN THE GLASS AS OUR OWN WRINKLES COME ONCE FRETTED OUR YOUNG SOULS WITH HER ANXIOUS HUMOURS AND IRRATIONAL PERSISTENCE
HE MUST TALK TO SETH BEFORE HE WENT TO SEE DINAH AND WITH THIS INTENTION IN HIS MIND HE WALKED BACK TO THE COTTAGE AND SAID TO HIS MOTHER DID SETH SAY ANYTHING TO THEE ABOUT WHEN HE WAS COMING HOME
BUT HERE THE RESEMBLANCE CEASED FOR MR CASSON'S HEAD WAS NOT AT ALL A MELANCHOLY-LOOKING SATELLITE NOR WAS IT A SPOTTY GLOBE AS MILTON HAS IRREVERENTLY CALLED THE MOON
AND AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK HETTY SAID GOOD-BYE TO THEM WITH THE SAME QUIET RESOLUTE AIR SHE HAD WORN ALL THE MORNING MOUNTING THE COACH THAT WAS TO TAKE HER TWENTY MILES BACK ALONG THE WAY SHE HAD COME
IF MOTHER TAKES TO PEOPLE AT THE BEGINNING SHE'S SURE TO GET FOND OF EM
I SHALL STAY WITH YOU TO-NIGHT LISBETH WAS PACIFIED BY THIS PROSPECT
NOW THE PLAN I'M THINKING OF IS TO EFFECT A LITTLE EXCHANGE
WE'RE LATE ENOUGH AS IT IS AN THERE'S NO LETTIN THE COWS KNOW AS THEY MUSTN'T WANT TO BE MILKED SO EARLY TO-MORROW MORNIN SO IF YOU'LL PLEASE T EXCUSE US WE'LL TAKE OUR LEAVE EH SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND AS THEY SET OFF IN THE CART I'D SOONER HA BREWIN DAY AND WASHIN DAY TOGETHER THAN ONE O THESE PLEASURIN DAYS
I CONFESS I HAVE OFTEN MEANLY SHRUNK FROM CONFESSING TO THESE ACCOMPLISHED AND ACUTE GENTLEMEN WHAT MY OWN EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN
THERE'S THAT POOR FOOL VIXEN WHIMPERING FOR ME AT HOME SAID BARTLE
HE STOOD A MOMENT AFTER THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM TREMBLING AND STUPEFIED
I'VE COME A GOOD LONG WAY AND IT'S VERY TIRING
GOD DISTRIBUTES TALENTS TO EVERY MAN ACCORDING AS HE SEES GOOD
HE HAD ALWAYS BOTH IN MAKING AND BREAKING RESOLUTIONS LOOKED BEYOND HIS PASSION AND SEEN THAT IT MUST SPEEDILY END IN SEPARATION
I'M AFRAID I SHOULD ONLY DO HARM INSTEAD OF GOOD IF I WERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE GATES MRS POYSER SAID THE CAPTAIN THOUGH I ASSURE YOU THERE'S NO MAN ON THE ESTATE I WOULD SOONER SAY A WORD FOR THAN YOUR HUSBAND
BUT MR IRWINE LAID HOLD OF HIS ARM AGAIN AND SAID PERSUASIVELY WAIT ADAM WAIT SO HE SAT DOWN
ADAM HAD BEEN OBSERVING HER CLOSELY ALL THE WHILE BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED AT HIM
BUT HOW COMES A LONE YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU TO BE THINKING O TAKING SUCH A JOURNEY AS THAT I'M GOING TO MY BROTHER--HE'S A SOLDIER AT WINDSOR SAID HETTY FRIGHTENED AT THE LANDLORD'S QUESTIONING LOOK
YOU'RE EVERYBODY'S FRIEND IN THIS BUSINESS--EVERYBODY'S FRIEND
YES HER TONGUE IS LIKE A NEW-SET RAZOR
BUT HETTY NEVER MINDED IT I COULD SEE THOUGH SHE'S BEEN AT THE NUSSIN O THE CHILD EVER SINCE IT WAS A BABBY
COME THEN SHE ADDED IN A TONE OF COMPLAINING AFFECTION AS DINAH SAT DOWN BY HER SIDE I'LL BE LOATH FOR YE T GO BUT YE CANNA STAY MUCH LONGER I DOUBT
BUT SHE WAS SILENT
BUT HER HEART BEGAN TO FLUTTER STRANGELY AND HER HANDS TO TREMBLE AS SHE BROKE THE SEAL
HETTY TREMBLED STILL WORSE UNDER THIS REAL FEAR AND SHAME THAN SHE HAD DONE IN HER MOMENTARY DREAM UNDER HER AUNT'S GLANCE
WELL GYP WELL ART GLAD TO SEE ME LISBETH WENT IN AGAIN QUICKLY AND LIGHTED A CANDLE FOR SHE HAD HEARD THE WELCOME RUSTLING OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE GRASS BEFORE GYP'S JOYFUL BARK
YOU DON'T VALUE YOUR PEAS FOR THEIR ROOTS OR YOUR CARROTS FOR THEIR FLOWERS
I'LL STAY SIR I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN
HAVE YOU POWER IN THE PRISON SIR YES
SHE SET THE DISH DOWN RATHER TIMIDLY ON THE BENCH BY ADAM'S SIDE AND SAID THEE CANST PICK A BIT WHILE THEE'T WORKIN I'LL BRING THEE ANOTHER DROP O WATER AYE MOTHER DO SAID ADAM KINDLY
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM WELL SETTLED IN THIS PARISH
SHE WOULD HAVE PRESSED HER OWN NAILS INTO HER TENDER FLESH RATHER THAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW A SECRET SHE DID NOT WANT THEM TO KNOW
THE FRUIT ALLAYS RIPENS SO CONTRAIRY JUST WHEN EVERY HAND'S WANTED
SHE LOOKED LIKE ST CATHERINE IN A QUAKER DRESS
I'D BE GLAD NOW IF YOU'D GO INTO THE GARDEN AND TELL HETTY TO SEND TOTTY IN
ON THE SIDE OF THE GREEN THAT LED TOWARDS THE CHURCH THE BROKEN LINE OF THATCHED COTTAGES WAS CONTINUED NEARLY TO THE CHURCHYARD GATE
IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AS HE WALKED FORWARD DINAH HAD PAUSED AND TURNED ROUND TO LOOK BACK AT THE VILLAGE--WHO DOES NOT PAUSE AND LOOK BACK IN MOUNTING A HILL
THAT COMMON ROUND RED FACE ONE SEES SOMETIMES IN THE MEN--ALL CHEEK AND NO FEATURES LIKE MARTIN POYSER'S--COMES OUT IN THE WOMEN OF THE FAMILY AS THE MOST CHARMING PHIZ IMAGINABLE WELL I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOUR CONTEMPLATING HETTY IN AN ARTISTIC LIGHT BUT I MUST NOT HAVE YOU FEEDING HER VANITY AND FILLING HER LITTLE NODDLE WITH THE NOTION THAT SHE'S A GREAT BEAUTY ATTRACTIVE TO FINE GENTLEMEN OR YOU WILL SPOIL HER FOR A POOR MAN'S WIFE--HONEST CRAIG'S FOR EXAMPLE WHOM I HAVE SEEN BESTOWING SOFT GLANCES ON HER
AN SUPPOSE I'M ILL AGAIN THIS WINTER AS I WAS THE WINTER BEFORE LAST
FOR THERE HAVE BEEN EVIL-DOERS AMONG US WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO DECEIVE THE BRETHREN AND SOME THERE ARE WHO DECEIVE THEIR OWN SELVES
IT'S LIKE A BAD SMELL TALKING OF EYES SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE THAT REMINDS ME THAT I'VE GOT A BOOK I MEANT TO BRING YOU GODMAMMA
THE APPLES AND NUTS WERE GATHERED AND STORED
I CAN'T STAND ALONE IN THIS WAY ANY LONGER CHAPTER XXXIX THE TIDINGS ADAM TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS BROXTON AND WALKED WITH HIS SWIFTEST STRIDE LOOKING AT HIS WATCH WITH THE FEAR THAT MR IRWINE MIGHT BE GONE OUT--HUNTING PERHAPS
WHAT CAN YE BOTH HA BEEN DOIN TILL THIS TIME THEE SHOULDSTNA SIT I THE DARK MOTHER SAID ADAM
BUT NOW SHE HAD ENTERED INTO A NEW CURRENT OF FEELING
I CAN'T DOUBT IT'S RIGHT FOR ME TO LOVE THE BEST THING GOD'S EVER GIVEN ME TO KNOW NAY ADAM
THERE WAS A FLASH OF HOPE AND HAPPINESS IN HER MIND AND WITH A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF GAIETY SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD VERY OFTEN DONE BEFORE--STUCK THE ROSE IN HER HAIR A LITTLE ABOVE THE LEFT EAR
THEM AS HA NEVER HAD A CUSHION DON'T MISS IT NAY NAY SAID MR POYSER WHO OBJECTED TO EXAGGERATED VIEWS
HE DESERVES TO WIN HER THOUGH THERE'S NO DENYING SHE'S A RARE BIT O WORKMANSHIP
NEVER MIND
TELL YOUR HUSBAND I SHALL COME AND HAVE A LONG TALK WITH HIM SOON MRS POYSER CURTSIED DULY AND WATCHED THE TWO HORSES UNTIL THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE YARD AMIDST GREAT EXCITEMENT ON THE PART OF THE PIGS AND THE POULTRY AND UNDER THE FURIOUS INDIGNATION OF THE BULL-DOG WHO PERFORMED A PYRRHIC DANCE THAT EVERY MOMENT SEEMED TO THREATEN THE BREAKING OF HIS CHAIN
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME SIR HE SAID WHEN THIS PAUSE HAD GIVEN HIM TIME TO REFLECT FOR RUNNING ON IN THIS WAY ABOUT MY OWN FEELINGS LIKE THAT FOOLISH DOG OF MINE HOWLING IN A STORM WHEN THERE'S NOBODY WANTS TO LISTEN TO ME
AND HE FETCHED THE LARGE BASKET WHICH WAS NEARLY FULL OF CURRANTS AND SET IT CLOSE TO THEM
I STOLE THE PRETTIEST BUT I DIDNA MEAN TO KEEP IT MYSELF
AND WHEN HETTY HAD READ THIS LETTER ALOUD TO HER UNCLE HE HAD SAID I WISH DINAH UD COME AGAIN NOW FOR SHE'D BE A COMFORT TO YOUR AUNT WHEN YOU'RE GONE
THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS ARTHUR DONNITHORNE KNOWN IN HAYSLOPE VARIOUSLY AS THE YOUNG SQUIRE THE HEIR AND THE CAPTAIN HE WAS ONLY A CAPTAIN IN THE LOAMSHIRE MILITIA BUT TO THE HAYSLOPE TENANTS HE WAS MORE INTENSELY A CAPTAIN THAN ALL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF THE SAME RANK IN HIS MAJESTY'S REGULARS--HE OUTSHONE THEM AS THE PLANET JUPITER OUTSHINES THE MILKY WAY
THEY SAT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER IN DELICIOUS SILENCE--FOR THE FIRST SENSE OF MUTUAL LOVE EXCLUDES OTHER FEELINGS
AND SO IT WAS WITH ARTHUR
IF THE OUTLINE HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT HIS FACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED JOLLY
SO MUCH OF OUR EARLY GLADNESS VANISHES UTTERLY FROM OUR MEMORY
AS FOR ARTHUR HE RUSHED BACK THROUGH THE WOOD AS IF HE WANTED TO PUT A WIDE SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HETTY
HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO SEE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE AGAIN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO AVOID HIM
I'VE BEEN A BIT HARD T EVERYBODY BUT HER
I DARESAY HE'D THINK ME A HODD TALKER AS YOU LOAMSHIRE FOLKS ALLAYS DOES HANY ONE AS TALKS THE RIGHT LANGUAGE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE SAID BARTLE MASSEY CONTEMPTUOUSLY
LET THAT MAN BEAR THE LOSS WHO LOOSED IT FROM ITS MOORINGS BUT THAT WILL NOT SAVE THE VESSEL--THE PRETTY THING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LASTING JOY
BUT THE ONLY WAY OF DISMISSING SUCH NONSENSE FROM HIS HEAD WAS TO GO AND SEE WHO IT WAS FOR HIS FANCY ONLY GOT NEARER AND NEARER TO BELIEF WHILE HE STOOD THERE LISTENING
THE DIVIL CANNA LAY HOULD O ME FOR THAT HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
AS HE STOPPED TO POINT OUT THE ROAD TO HER SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET TO GET THE SIX-PENCE READY AND WHEN HE WAS TURNING AWAY WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-MORNING SHE HELD IT OUT TO HIM AND SAID THANK YOU
BUT SHE'S SPOILED SHAMEFUL
THE BLOW HAD BEEN GIVEN NOW TOWARDS WHICH HE HAD BEEN STRAINING ALL THE FORCE OF NERVE AND MUSCLE--AND WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF IT
BUT AN EXPERIENCED EYE WOULD HAVE FIXED ON HIM AT ONCE AS THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH AFTER SEEING THE HUMBLE DEFERENCE WITH WHICH THE BIG SAUCY FELLOW TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND STROKED HIS HAIR TO THE FARMERS
I'M NOT LIKELY TO SETTLE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS TILL I'M A STOUT GENTLEMAN OF FORTY
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION BEFORE ADAM WENT AWAY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS FINDING A HOUSE THAT WOULD DO FOR HIM TO SETTLE IN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO IF SHE WERE NOT THERE
AND SO IS MY UNCLE I'M SURE NOW HE'S HEARD IT BUT HE WAS GONE OUT TO ROSSETER ALL YESTERDAY
YET TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE TENDER HEARTS HAVE BEATEN FOR THEM AND THEIR MINIATURES--FLATTERING BUT STILL NOT LOVELY--ARE KISSED IN SECRET BY MOTHERLY LIPS
YOU HEAR THEIR SOFT LIQUID LAUGHTER--BUT IF YOU LOOK WITH A TOO CURIOUS SACRILEGIOUS EYE THEY VANISH BEHIND THE SILVERY BEECHES THEY MAKE YOU BELIEVE THAT THEIR VOICE WAS ONLY A RUNNING BROOKLET PERHAPS THEY METAMORPHOSE THEMSELVES INTO A TAWNY SQUIRREL THAT SCAMPERS AWAY AND MOCKS YOU FROM THE TOPMOST BOUGH
AND INSTEAD OF BURSTING OUT INTO WILD ACCUSING APOSTROPHES TO GOD AND DESTINY HE IS RESOLVING AS HE NOW WALKS HOMEWARDS UNDER THE SOLEMN STARLIGHT TO REPRESS HIS SADNESS TO BE LESS BENT ON HAVING HIS OWN WILL AND TO LIVE MORE FOR OTHERS AS DINAH DOES
HE TURNED ROUND AND LAYING HIS HAND ON ADAM'S SHOULDER SAID WHY WOULDST LIKE HER TO MARRY THEE BROTHER ADAM LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT SETH'S INQUIRING EYES AND SAID WOULDST BE HURT IF SHE WAS TO BE FONDER O ME THAN O THEE NAY SAID SETH WARMLY HOW CANST THINK IT
THE WORST WAS WHEN THEY TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
I THINK I SAW YOU ONCE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM IT ISN'T MRS BEST IT'S MRS POMFRET THE LADY'S MAID AS I GO TO SEE
BUT THE NEXT MINUTE AS HE WAS LIFTING THE CUP TO HIS LIPS HE REMEMBERED HOW THOROUGHLY HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND LAST NIGHT TO TELL IRWINE
AND DIRECTLY BELOW THEM THE EYE RESTED ON A MORE ADVANCED LINE OF HANGING WOODS DIVIDED BY BRIGHT PATCHES OF PASTURE OR FURROWED CROPS AND NOT YET DEEPENED INTO THE UNIFORM LEAFY CURTAINS OF HIGH SUMMER BUT STILL SHOWING THE WARM TINTS OF THE YOUNG OAK AND THE TENDER GREEN OF THE ASH AND LIME
WHEN PEOPLE'S FEELINGS HAVE GOT A DEADLY WOUND THEY CAN'T BE CURED WITH FAVOURS FAVOURS SAID ARTHUR PASSIONATELY
BESSY CRANAGE IN HER NEATEST CAP AND FROCK WAS CRYING THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW WHY
THEY STOOD SO A LONG WHILE FOR NEITHER OF THEM FELT THE IMPULSE TO MOVE APART AGAIN
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D DONE FOR ME EH
MARTIN POYSER AND ADAM HIMSELF HAD BOTH TOLD MR IRWINE ALL ABOUT IT--THAT ADAM HAD BEEN DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH HETTY THESE TWO YEARS AND THAT NOW IT WAS AGREED THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED IN MARCH
NOW SIT DOWN IN THIS COMFORTABLE CHAIR AND HERE IS MILLS READY TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE BEST HE HURRIED AWAY TO SEEK ANOTHER MATRONLY PARTNER FOR DUE HONOUR MUST BE PAID TO THE MARRIED WOMEN BEFORE HE ASKED ANY OF THE YOUNG ONES
DINAH PUT OUT HER HAND AND SAID YOU'LL HAVE SWEET PEACE IN YOUR MIND TO-DAY SETH FOR YOUR TENDERNESS AND LONG-SUFFERING TOWARDS YOUR AGED MOTHER SHE TURNED ROUND AND LEFT THE WORKSHOP AS QUICKLY AND QUIETLY AS SHE HAD ENTERED IT
BUT GOD LASTS WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS GONE
GOD FORBID I SHOULD MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR YOU
BUT I CAN'T OFTEN SAY WHAT I'LL DO BEFOREHAND FOR THE WORK OFTEN HOLDS ME LONGER THAN I EXPECT
YOUR WISH FOR ME TO STAY IS NOT A CALL OF DUTY WHICH I REFUSE TO HEARKEN TO BECAUSE IT IS AGAINST MY OWN DESIRES
AND THE FIGURE BEFORE HIM TOUCHED HIM WITH THE SIGNS OF SUFFERING
AN I'M NONE FOR HAVING HER SO OVERPRETTY
IT'LL MAKE AGAINST HER WITH THE JURY I DOUBT HER BEING SO OBSTINATE
YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER
THAT'S NO BUSINESS OF YOURS SO LONG AS HE DOESN'T HINDER YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU LIKE
AND AS FOR HER CHEESE I KNOW WELL ENOUGH IT ROSE LIKE A LOAF IN A TIN LAST YEAR
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF LIFE
CHAPTER LV MARRIAGE BELLS IN LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH AFTER THAT MEETING ON THE HILL--ON A RIMY MORNING IN DEPARTING NOVEMBER--ADAM AND DINAH WERE MARRIED
I TOLD HER I'D CALL AND ASK YOU AS I CAME FROM THE VILLAGE
I'D RATHER YOU'D ACT AS MY ENEMY AND FIGHT ME WHERE I STAND--IT'S ALL TH AMENDS YOU CAN MAKE ME POOR ADAM POSSESSED BY RAGE THAT COULD FIND NO OTHER VENT BEGAN TO THROW OFF HIS COAT AND HIS CAP TOO BLIND WITH PASSION TO NOTICE THE CHANGE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE IN ARTHUR WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING
IT SEEMS AS IF THE VERY GREATNESS O THE TROUBLE HAD QUIETED AND CALMED HER
SO I AM CONTENT TO TELL MY SIMPLE STORY WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE THINGS SEEM BETTER THAN THEY WERE
APART FROM THIS FOREBODING THINGS WENT ON MUCH AS USUAL IN THE POYSER HOUSEHOLD
THOU HAST KNOWN THE DEPTHS OF ALL SORROW
AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU--SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR
BUT STAY OUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND LET US CALL THE CHILDREN
SWEET--SWEET LITTLE HETTY
THINGS HAD GONE ON JUST THE SAME AS EVER SINCE THAT EVENING
A LETTER LAY OPEN ON THE TABLE AND MR IRWINE'S HAND WAS ON IT BUT THE CHANGED GLANCE HE CAST ON ADAM COULD NOT BE OWING ENTIRELY TO PREOCCUPATION WITH SOME DISAGREEABLE BUSINESS FOR HE WAS LOOKING EAGERLY TOWARDS THE DOOR AS IF ADAM'S ENTRANCE WERE A MATTER OF POIGNANT ANXIETY TO HIM
I HAVE ALL THINGS AND ABOUND AT SNOWFIELD
AN YOU DIDN KNOW SHE WAS AWAY FROM HOME THEN NO SAID ADAM BUT I THOUGHT IT LIKELY SHE MIGHT BE AWAY SEEING AS IT'S SUNDAY
BUT WHAT'S THE MATTER WHY SIR I HAD TO COME TO BROX'ON TO DELIVER SOME WORK AND I THOUGHT IT BUT RIGHT TO CALL AND LET YOU KNOW THE GOINS-ON AS THERE'S BEEN I THE VILLAGE SUCH AS I HANNA SEEN I MY TIME AND I'VE LIVED IN IT MAN AND BOY SIXTY YEAR COME ST THOMAS AND COLLECTED TH EASTER DUES FOR MR BLICK BEFORE YOUR REVERENCE COME INTO THE PARISH AND BEEN AT THE RINGIN O EVERY BELL AND THE DIGGIN O EVERY GRAVE AND SUNG I THE CHOIR LONG AFORE BARTLE MASSEY COME FROM NOBODY KNOWS WHERE WI HIS COUNTER-SINGIN AND FINE ANTHEMS AS PUTS EVERYBODY OUT BUT HIMSELF--ONE TAKIN IT UP AFTER ANOTHER LIKE SHEEP A-BLEATIN I TH FOLD
AS SHE FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE HOVEL SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD GIVE HIM A SIXPENCE FOR TELLING HER THE WAY AND THEN HE WOULD NOT SUPPOSE SHE WAS WILD
HERE'S THE TURNING SIR
I WAS WRONG WHEN I SPOKE AS IF YOU'D DONE ME AN INJURY KNOWINGLY BUT I WASN'T WRONG IN WHAT I SAID BEFORE ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOUR T HETTY AND I CAN'T SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU AS IF I HELD YOU MY FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER TILL YOU'VE CLEARED THAT UP BETTER ARTHUR SWALLOWED HIS PRIDE AND RESENTMENT AS HE DREW BACK HIS HAND
IF YOU COULD MAKE A PUDDING WI THINKING O THE BATTER IT UD BE EASY GETTING DINNER
SHE HAD NO CHILDREN FOR SHE WAS NEVER MARRIED AND SHE BROUGHT ME UP AS TENDERLY AS IF I'D BEEN HER OWN CHILD EH SHE'D FINE WORK WI YE I'LL WARRANT BRINGIN YE UP FROM A BABBY AN HER A LONE WOMAN--IT'S ILL BRINGIN UP A CADE LAMB
THERE WERE OF COURSE WELL-SOAPED POLES TO BE CLIMBED BY THE BOYS AND YOUTHS RACES TO BE RUN BY THE OLD WOMEN RACES TO BE RUN IN SACKS HEAVY WEIGHTS TO BE LIFTED BY THE STRONG MEN AND A LONG LIST OF CHALLENGES TO SUCH AMBITIOUS ATTEMPTS AS THAT OF WALKING AS MANY YARDS POSSIBLE ON ONE LEG--FEATS IN WHICH IT WAS GENERALLY REMARKED THAT WIRY BEN BEING THE LISSOM'ST SPRINGEST FELLOW I THE COUNTRY WAS SURE TO BE PRE-EMINENT
HE KNOWSNA AS I PUT SALT IN'S BROTH BUT HE'D MISS IT PRETTY QUICK IF IT WARNA THERE
I ONCE HAD OCCASION TO GO THERE
AND HE HAD BEEN DECIDEDLY ENCOURAGED IN THIS IDEA BY JOSHUA RANN WHO OBSERVED THAT IT WAS NOTHING BUT RIGHT TO DO SOMETHING TO PLEASE THE YOUNG SQUIRE IN RETURN FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE FOR THEM
BE ANGRY WITH ME MY SWEET ONE I DESERVE IT
EH I LIKE THEM WORDS--'I SHALL GO TO HIM BUT HE WONNA COME BACK TO ME DINAH AND SETH WERE BOTH INWARDLY OFFERING THANKS FOR THE GREATER QUIETNESS OF SPIRIT THAT HAD COME OVER LISBETH
THERE WAS A TEXT ABOVE IT WRITTEN AS WELL AS THE NAME BY DINAH'S OWN HAND WITH A LITTLE PENCIL ONE EVENING THAT THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER AND HETTY HAPPENED TO HAVE THE RED CASE LYING OPEN BEFORE HER
MY HEART IS KNIT TO YOUR AGED MOTHER SINCE IT WAS GRANTED ME TO BE NEAR HER IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE
AND THE FEELING EVEN SUFFUSED ITSELF OVER HIS FACE SO AS TO ATTRACT HIS MOTHER'S NOTICE WHILE SHE WAS DRINKING HER TEA
HE'D BE STUCK FAST LIKE A COW I WET CLAY
SHE CURSED HIM WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HER CURSING WOULD DO
WHEN SHE GOT OFF THIS COACH SHE BEGAN TO WALK AGAIN AND TAKE CHEAP RIDES IN CARTS AND GET CHEAP MEALS GOING ON AND ON WITHOUT DISTINCT PURPOSE YET STRANGELY BY SOME FASCINATION TAKING THE WAY SHE HAD COME THOUGH SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO GO BACK TO HER OWN COUNTRY
I TRUST YOU FEEL RESTED AND STRENGTHENED AGAIN TO BEAR THE BURDEN AND HEAT OF THE DAY IT WAS LIKE DREAMING OF THE SUNSHINE AND AWAKING IN THE MOONLIGHT
WHO'S A-GOIN TO WAKE HIM
BUT HE HAD NO SOONER GONE A FEW PACES BEYOND THE DOOR THAN LISBETH BECAME UNEASY AT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD VEXED HIM
HE COULD NO MORE STIR IN HER THE EMOTIONS THAT MAKE THE SWEET INTOXICATION OF YOUNG LOVE THAN THE MERE PICTURE OF A SUN CAN STIR THE SPRING SAP IN THE SUBTLE FIBRES OF THE PLANT
BUT IT IS REALLY TOO HARD UPON HUMAN NATURE THAT IT SHOULD BE HELD A CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO IMAGINE THE DEATH EVEN OF THE KING WHEN HE IS TURNED EIGHTY-THREE
WHEN ARTHUR WENT UP TO HIS DRESSING-ROOM AGAIN AFTER LUNCHEON IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT THE DEBATE HE HAD HAD WITH HIMSELF THERE EARLIER IN THE DAY SHOULD FLASH ACROSS HIS MIND
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HER--SHE PLEASED ME A GOOD DEAL
AND THEN I THOUGHT IT CAME FROM THE GROUND
HER MOTHER'S FORTUNE HAD BEEN SPENT BY THAT GOOD-FOR-NOUGHT SORREL AND HETTY HAD SORREL'S BLOOD IN HER VEINS
I DARE NOT ASSERT THAT IT WAS NOT SO
A GOOD SOLID BIT O WORK LASTS
NOW LET US GO ON FOR WE'RE PRETTY NIGH THE LAST I THINK I KNOW WHAT TO DO NEVER FEAR SAID BARTLE MOVING ON
IT IS A MEMORY THAT GIVES A MORE EXQUISITE TOUCH TO TENDERNESS THAT FEEDS THE MADNESS OF JEALOUSY AND ADDS THE LAST KEENNESS TO THE AGONY OF DESPAIR
THE INNKEEPER DECLARED THAT HE REALLY WANTED TO GO TO OAKBOURNE AND MIGHT AS WELL GO TO-NIGHT
AND THOSE WERE ALWAYS TIMES OF GREAT BLESSING THOUGH I HAD NEVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE SO WITH ME BEFORE A CONGREGATION OF PEOPLE
IT CAME DOWN IN A PARCEL FROM LONDON THE OTHER DAY
IT WAS ASLEEP ITSELF ON THE MOSS-GROWN COW-SHED
GOOD-NIGHT HETTY HETTY COULD ONLY SMILE AND NOT SHAKE HANDS FOR HERS WERE DYED AND DAMP WITH CURRANT-JUICE
MELODIES DIE OUT LIKE THE PIPE OF PAN WITH THE EARS THAT LOVE THEM AND LISTEN FOR THEM
SOMETIMES HE WOULD BURST OUT INTO VEHEMENT SPEECH IF I COULD HA DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HER--IF MY BEARING ANYTHING WOULD HA DONE ANY GOOD...BUT T HAVE TO SIT STILL AND KNOW IT AND DO NOTHING...IT'S HARD FOR A MAN TO BEAR...AND TO THINK O WHAT MIGHT HA BEEN NOW IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM....O GOD IT'S THE VERY DAY WE SHOULD HA BEEN MARRIED AYE MY LAD SAID BARTLE TENDERLY IT'S HEAVY--IT'S HEAVY
FOR NOW SINCE YOU TELL ME OF YOUR STRONG LOVE TOWARDS ME WHAT WAS CLEAR TO ME HAS BECOME DARK AGAIN
YOU'RE GOING T HAVE A BIT O FUN I HOPE NOW YOUR WORK'S ALL DONE
I HANNA HAD A TALK WITH YOU THIS LONG WHILE AND THE MISSIS HERE WANTS YOU TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH HER BEST SPINNING-WHEEL FOR IT'S GOT BROKE AND IT'LL BE A NICE JOB TO MEND IT--THERE'LL WANT A BIT O TURNING
AND YOUR LITTLE CAP AND CHRISTENING DRESS WERE BURIED WITH HER TOO
BUT I GATHERED FROM ADAM BEDE TO WHOM I TALKED OF THESE MATTERS IN HIS OLD AGE THAT FEW CLERGYMEN COULD BE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN WINNING THE HEARTS OF THEIR PARISHIONERS THAN MR RYDE
HIS DEED WAS REACTING UPON HIM--WAS ALREADY GOVERNING HIM TYRANNOUSLY AND FORCING HIM INTO A COURSE THAT JARRED WITH HIS HABITUAL FEELINGS
SETH WAS PREPARED FOR THE WORST NOW FOR EVEN IN HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF THEIR BOYHOOD ADAM HAD NEVER SOBBED BEFORE
FOR TOTTY HAVING SPEEDILY RECOVERED FROM HER THREATENED FEVER HAD INSISTED ON GOING TO CHURCH TO-DAY AND ESPECIALLY ON WEARING HER RED-AND-BLACK NECKLACE OUTSIDE HER TIPPET
THE SOUND WAS SO PECULIAR THAT THE MOMENT HE HEARD IT IT CALLED UP THE IMAGE OF THE WILLOW WAND STRIKING THE DOOR
HE WOULD BE NEAR HER AS LONG AS HE COULD
WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT JESUS FELT BECAUSE HE CAME IN A BODY LIKE OURS AND SPOKE WORDS SUCH AS WE SPEAK TO EACH OTHER
THERE WERE THREE OTHER COUPLES FOLLOWING THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
THE MILKING OF THE COWS WAS A SIGHT MRS POYSER LOVED AND AT THIS HOUR ON MILD DAYS SHE WAS USUALLY STANDING AT THE HOUSE DOOR WITH HER KNITTING IN HER HANDS IN QUIET CONTEMPLATION ONLY HEIGHTENED TO A KEENER INTEREST WHEN THE VICIOUS YELLOW COW WHO HAD ONCE KICKED OVER A PAILFUL OF PRECIOUS MILK WAS ABOUT TO UNDERGO THE PREVENTIVE PUNISHMENT OF HAVING HER HINDER-LEGS STRAPPED
CHAPTER XI IN THE COTTAGE IT WAS BUT HALF-PAST FOUR THE NEXT MORNING WHEN DINAH TIRED OF LYING AWAKE LISTENING TO THE BIRDS AND WATCHING THE GROWING LIGHT THROUGH THE LITTLE WINDOW IN THE GARRET ROOF ROSE AND BEGAN TO DRESS HERSELF VERY QUIETLY LEST SHE SHOULD DISTURB LISBETH
FOR THE WORLD HE WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN OF HIS LOVE TO HETTY YET TILL THIS COMMENCING KINDNESS TOWARDS HIM SHOULD HAVE GROWN INTO UNMISTAKABLE LOVE
EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A STRONG HOPE THAT SHE WAS FOND OF HIM--AND HIS HOPE WAS FAR FROM BEING STRONG--HE HAD BEEN TOO HEAVILY BURDENED WITH OTHER CLAIMS TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR HIMSELF AND HETTY--A HOME SUCH AS HE COULD EXPECT HER TO BE CONTENT WITH AFTER THE COMFORT AND PLENTY OF THE FARM
YOU MAY TEAR THEM FROM THEIR NATIVE NOOK OF ROCK OR WALL AND JUST LAY THEM OVER YOUR ORNAMENTAL FLOWER-POT AND THEY BLOSSOM NONE THE WORSE
AND SHE BORE HER AUNT'S PUTTING A STOP TO HER WEEKLY LESSON IN FINE-WORK AT THE CHASE WITHOUT THE LEAST GRUMBLING OR POUTING
BUT WHEN HE HASTENED TO HER SHE WAS VERY KIND AND ASKED HIM TO GO IN AGAIN WHEN HE HAD TAKEN HER TO THE YARD GATE
SHE CARESNA FOR SETH
SO I'LL BID YOU GOOD-NIGHT WELL WELL WE'LL GO TO THE GATE WITH YOU--IT'S A FINE NIGHT SAID BARTLE TAKING UP HIS STICK
SHE HATED THE WRITER OF THAT LETTER--HATED HIM FOR THE VERY REASON THAT SHE HUNG UPON HIM WITH ALL HER LOVE--ALL THE GIRLISH PASSION AND VANITY THAT MADE UP HER LOVE
YOU CAN'T MAKE MUCH OUT WI TALKING ABOUT IT BUT YOU FEEL IT
HE HAD TOO LITTLE FELLOW-FEELING WITH THE WEAKNESS THAT ERRS IN SPITE OF FORESEEN CONSEQUENCES
WILL YOU REMEMBER IT HETTY YES SAID HETTY RATHER FRIGHTENED
AND HE HAD WRAPPED THE BOX UP IN A GREAT MANY COVERS THAT HE MIGHT SEE HETTY UNWRAPPING IT WITH GROWING CURIOSITY TILL AT LAST HER EYES FLASHED BACK THEIR NEW DELIGHT INTO HIS
LET US CULTIVATE IT TO THE UTMOST IN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN--IN OUR GARDENS AND IN OUR HOUSES
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER HE SAID HIS THOUGHTS FLYING AT ONCE TO BODILY ACCIDENT
THE GREY CHURCH-TOWER AND VILLAGE ROOFS LIE BEFORE THEM TO THE LEFT AND FARTHER ON TO THE RIGHT THEY CAN JUST SEE THE CHIMNEYS OF THE HALL FARM
SOME CHEESES ARE MADE O SKIMMED MILK AND SOME O NEW MILK AND IT'S NO MATTER WHAT YOU CALL EM YOU MAY TELL WHICH IS WHICH BY THE LOOK AND THE SMELL
I SHANNA WAKE HIM WI LOOKIN AT HIM
TWO GREAT DROPS WOULD FALL THEN BUT NO ONE SAW THEM EXCEPT GOOD-NATURED MOLLY FOR HER AUNT AND UNCLE KNELT WITH THEIR BACKS TOWARDS HER
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU THINK I SHALL BE IN TROUBLE
HER EYES WERE FIXED IN CONTEMPLATION OF SOMETHING VISIBLE ONLY TO HERSELF
HE WOULD LIKE TO SATISFY HIS SOUL FOR A DAY WITH LOOKING AT THEM AND HE MUST SEE HER AGAIN--HE MUST SEE HER SIMPLY TO REMOVE ANY FALSE IMPRESSION FROM HER MIND ABOUT HIS MANNER TO HER JUST NOW
HALLO ARTHUR THAT'S A GOOD FELLOW
HE WAS NOT GOING TO LET ANYTHING ALONE BECAUSE ADAM BEDE TURNED UP HIS NOSE AT IT
BUT SHE WENT ON LOOKING AT ADAM DONNA THEE TALK O GOIN SOUTH'ARD OR NORTH'ARD AN LEAVIN THY FEYTHER AND MOTHER I THE CHURCHYARD AN GOIN TO A COUNTRY AS THEY KNOW NOTHIN ON
NO MOTHER HE SAID I'LL NOT CONSENT BUT SETH SHALL HAVE A HAND IN IT TOO IF IT'S TO BE DONE AT HOME
YOU'RE ABOUT AS NEAR THE RIGHT LANGUAGE AS A PIG'S SQUEAKING IS LIKE A TUNE PLAYED ON A KEY-BUGLE WELL I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED MR CASSON WITH AN ANGRY SMILE
IT WAS ON JUST SUCH A SORT OF EVENING AS THIS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL AND MY AUNT AS BROUGHT ME UP TOOK ME TO HEAR A GOOD MAN PREACH OUT OF DOORS JUST AS WE ARE HERE
WE SHALL NOT SOIL YOUR BEAUTIFUL FLOOR OH SIR DON'T MENTION IT SAID MRS POYSER
IT WAS AS UNREASONABLE IMPRACTICABLE A WISH AS SHE HAD EVER URGED BUT HE COULD NOT HELP BEING MOVED BY SO ENTIRELY NEW AN IDEA
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANOTHER TENANT BESIDES POYSER AS UD PUT UP WI NEVER HAVING A BIT O REPAIRS DONE TILL A PLACE TUMBLES DOWN--AND NOT THEN ON'Y WI BEGGING AND PRAYING AND HAVING TO PAY HALF--AND BEING STRUNG UP WI THE RENT AS IT'S MUCH IF HE GETS ENOUGH OUT O THE LAND TO PAY FOR ALL HE'S PUT HIS OWN MONEY INTO THE GROUND BEFOREHAND
HAVE YOU COME FAR YES SAID HETTY ROUSED BY THIS QUESTION TO EXERT MORE SELF-COMMAND AND FEELING THE BETTER FOR THE FOOD SHE HAD TAKEN
BUT AT PRESENT SHE WAS DOING WHAT REQUIRED ONLY THE DIMMEST LIGHT--SPONGING THE ACHING HEAD THAT LAY ON THE PILLOW WITH FRESH VINEGAR
HE DETERMINED TO GO TO THE VILLAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE ATTEND TO HIS BUSINESS FOR AN HOUR AND GIVE NOTICE TO BURGE OF HIS BEING OBLIGED TO GO ON A JOURNEY WHICH HE MUST BEG HIM NOT TO MENTION TO ANY ONE
I KNOW IT'S DREADFUL
AND I MADE MYSELF A BED EVER SO FAR BEHIND WHERE NOBODY COULD FIND ME
AND ONE DAY WHEN SHE PUT HER NEW CAP ON AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE SAW A BLEEDING FACE CROWNED WITH THORNS
BESIDES I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THEY ARE ASPERSIONS
AH SAID BARTLE SNEERINGLY THE WOMEN ARE QUICK ENOUGH--THEY'RE QUICK ENOUGH
THERE WAS THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET FULL OF SCRAPS AND DEEP DOWN IN IT ARTHUR FELT IN AN INSTANT THERE WAS THE LITTLE PINK SILK HANDKERCHIEF
ONE CANNOT EVEN FIND FAULT WITH THE TINY ROUND HOLE WHICH THEY LEAVE WHEN THEY ARE TAKEN OUT
A TERRIBLE SCORCHING LIGHT SHOWED HIM THE HIDDEN LETTERS THAT CHANGED THE MEANING OF THE PAST
HE SAYS HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SUPERINTEND A LITTLE BUSINESS OF HIS OWN WHICH HE AND SETH WILL CARRY ON AND WILL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO ENLARGE BY DEGREES
AND THE DEATH OF THE POOR WANDERER WHEN SHE WAS COMING BACK TO US HAS BEEN SORROW UPON SORROW SEE ADDY SAID SETH LOWERING THE YOUNG ONE TO HIS ARM NOW AND POINTING THERE'S FATHER COMING--AT THE FAR STILE DINAH HASTENED HER STEPS AND LITTLE LISBETH RAN ON AT HER UTMOST SPEED TILL SHE CLASPED HER FATHER'S LEG
DON'T TELL ME ABOUT GOD HAVING MADE SUCH CREATURES TO BE COMPANIONS FOR US
AND AT SNOWFIELD THERE ARE BRETHREN AND SISTERS IN GREAT NEED WHO HAVE NONE OF THOSE COMFORTS YOU HAVE AROUND YOU
SHE ALLAYS TAKES AGAINST HETTY WHEN SHE ISN'T WELL
NO WONDER THAT NOT-WITHSTANDING HIS DESIRE TO GET ON HE COULD NOT HELP PAUSING TO LOOK AT A CURIOUS LARGE BEECH WHICH HE HAD SEEN STANDING BEFORE HIM AT A TURNING IN THE ROAD AND CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT TWO TREES WEDDED TOGETHER BUT ONLY ONE
I AM POOR LIKE YOU
I RECKON THEE'ST HED THY SUPPER AT SOME O THY METHODY FOLKS NAY MOTHER SAID SETH I'VE HAD NO SUPPER YET COME THEN SAID LISBETH BUT DONNA THEE ATE THE TATERS FOR ADAM ULL HAPPEN ATE EM IF I LEAVE EM STANNIN HE LOVES A BIT O TATERS AN GRAVY
THERE WAS NO NEED TO DEBATE WITH HIMSELF ANY LONGER
I'D BE ASHAMED TO STAND BEFORE YOU HERE IF IT WASNA TRUE
I WANT TO SEE HER WHERE IS THE LITTLE UN HETTY SAID MRS POYSER
SHE OPENED THE WINDOW AND LET IN THE FRESH MORNING AIR AND THE SMELL OF THE SWEET-BRIER AND THE BRIGHT LOW-SLANTING RAYS OF THE EARLY SUN WHICH MADE A GLORY ABOUT HER PALE FACE AND PALE AUBURN HAIR AS SHE HELD THE LONG BRUSH AND SWEPT SINGING TO HERSELF IN A VERY LOW TONE--LIKE A SWEET SUMMER MURMUR THAT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN FOR VERY CLOSELY--ONE OF CHARLES WESLEY'S HYMNS
BUT HE HEARD NO REPLY
THE DIMPLES WERE ALL GONE--ALL BUT ONE THAT NEVER WENT
YOU WILL BELIEVE MY PROGNOSTICATIONS ANOTHER TIME THOUGH I DARESAY I SHAN'T LIVE TO PROGNOSTICATE ANYTHING BUT MY OWN DEATH WHAT HAVE THEY DONE ABOUT ARTHUR SAID MR IRWINE
AND WHEN THEY ASKED HIM HOW IT WAS THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT OFF GRIEVING NOW THE CHILD WAS DEAD HE SAID WHILE THE CHILD WAS YET ALIVE I FASTED AND WEPT
EH I'M LOATH TO SEE THE LAST ON HER SHE SAID TO ADAM AS THEY TURNED INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN
WHAT'S TH USE O SETTIN STORE BY THINGS AS ARE THIRTY MILE OFF
HETTY WAS NOT WITHOUT A COMPANION AND SHE HAD BESIDES MORE PINK AND WHITE ABOUT HER THAN EVER FOR SHE HELD IN HER HAND THE WONDERFUL PINK-AND-WHITE HOT-HOUSE PLANT WITH A VERY LONG NAME--A SCOTCH NAME SHE SUPPOSED SINCE PEOPLE SAID MR CRAIG THE GARDENER WAS SCOTCH
AND I SAT AGAINST THE HAYSTACK TO WATCH IF ANYBODY UD COME
I MET AS FINE A YOUNG FELLOW AS EVER I SAW IN MY LIFE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO BEFORE I CAME UP THE HILL--A CARPENTER A TALL BROAD-SHOULDERED FELLOW WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES MARCHING ALONG LIKE A SOLDIER
IT'S CHOICE O MISLIKINGS IS ALL I'N GOT I THIS WORLD
EH I WOULDNA MIND HA'IN A DAUGHTER LIKE THAT
IT HAS BEEN GIVEN ME TO HELP TO COMFORT AND STRENGTHEN THE LITTLE FLOCK THERE AND TO CALL IN MANY WANDERERS
AT LAST ADAM LIFTED UP HIS HEAD FOR THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT ROUND HIM
WE THOUGHT IT UD BE BAD LUCK IF THE OLD SQUIRE GAVE US NOTICE THIS LADY DAY BUT I MUST GI NOTICE MYSELF NOW AN SEE IF THERE CAN ANYBODY BE GOT TO COME AN TAKE TO THE CROPS AS I'N PUT I THE GROUND
IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER-NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM
I BELIEVE HE MEANT RIGHT AT BOTTOM
IT WAS A FEEBLER RELIEF A FEEBLER TRIUMPH SHE FELT NOW BUT THE GREAT DARK EYES AND THE SWEET LIPS WERE AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER PERHAPS MORE BEAUTIFUL FOR THERE WAS A MORE LUXURIANT WOMANLINESS ABOUT HETTY OF LATE
EVERYBODY WAS COME BACK FROM THE MEADOW
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE--I'D SOONER DO IT--I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE
PERHAPS HERE LAY THE SECRET OF THE HARDNESS HE HAD ACCUSED HIMSELF OF
LET A-BE LET A-BE
YOU MUST SHOW COURAGE
HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL-LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
THERE ARE FACES WHICH NATURE CHARGES WITH A MEANING AND PATHOS NOT BELONGING TO THE SINGLE HUMAN SOUL THAT FLUTTERS BENEATH THEM BUT SPEAKING THE JOYS AND SORROWS OF FOREGONE GENERATIONS--EYES THAT TELL OF DEEP LOVE WHICH DOUBTLESS HAS BEEN AND IS SOMEWHERE BUT NOT PAIRED WITH THESE EYES--PERHAPS PAIRED WITH PALE EYES THAT CAN SAY NOTHING
AND THE YOUNG UNS ULL BE IN AND WANTING THEIRS DIRECTLY
HE COULD NOT GATHER WHAT WAS VEXING HER BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM TO FEEL OTHERWISE THAN THAT SHE WAS THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WORLD AND THAT IF HE COULD HAVE HIS WAY NOTHING SHOULD EVER VEX HER ANY MORE
WE ARE OFTEN STARTLED BY THE SEVERITY OF MILD PEOPLE ON EXCEPTIONAL OCCASIONS
SHE TURNED UP HER SLEEVES AND KISSED HER ARMS WITH THE PASSIONATE LOVE OF LIFE
BUT THE DELIGHT WAS TOO STRONG TO CONTINUE SMOULDERING IN A GRIN--IT BURST OUT THE NEXT INSTANT IN A LONG-DRAWN HAW HAW FOLLOWED BY A SUDDEN COLLAPSE INTO UTTER GRAVITY AS THE KNIFE AND FORK DARTED DOWN ON THE PREY
COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
IT SEEMED BUT YESTERDAY--THAT TIME SO MANY MIDSUMMERS AGO WHEN SHE HAD TOLD THIAS WHERE THIS LINEN LAY THAT HE MIGHT BE SURE AND REACH IT OUT FOR HER WHEN SHE DIED FOR SHE WAS THE ELDER OF THE TWO
I'LL NEVER BE HARD AGAIN
GAWAINE IS HARSH IN HIS MANNERS
ON THE GROUP OF WHITE DUCKS NESTLING TOGETHER WITH THEIR BILLS TUCKED UNDER THEIR WINGS
THE PRIDE OF HER HEART HAS GIVEN WAY AND SHE LEANS ON ME FOR HELP AND DESIRES TO BE TAUGHT
AND WHAT A TIME IT WOULD BE BEFORE SHE COULD GET TO THE END OF HER JOURNEY
THOSE POOR LEAN COBBLERS WHO THINK THEY CAN HELP TO REGENERATE MANKIND BY SETTING OUT TO PREACH IN THE MORNING TWILIGHT BEFORE THEY BEGIN THEIR DAY'S WORK MAY WELL HAVE A POOR OPINION OF ME
BUT THEN HE ACTED PRETTY MUCH UP TO WHAT HE SAID
AND KEEPIN YOUR FACE I SMILIN ORDER LIKE A GROCER O MARKET-DAY FOR FEAR PEOPLE SHOULDNA THINK YOU CIVIL ENOUGH
AND HETTY HAD BROUGHT DISGRACE ON THEM ALL--DISGRACE THAT COULD NEVER BE WIPED OUT
IT HAD FALLEN THAT SIDE UPWARDS SO THE GLASS WAS NOT BROKEN
THEY SEEMED RATHER TO BE SHEDDING LOVE THAN MAKING OBSERVATIONS
BUT AT PRESENT WE CAN ONLY SEE THAT HE HAS A BROAD FLAT BACK AND AN ABUNDANCE OF POWDERED HAIR ALL THROWN BACKWARD AND TIED BEHIND WITH A BLACK RIBBON--A BIT OF CONSERVATISM IN COSTUME WHICH TELLS YOU THAT HE IS NOT A YOUNG MAN
CHAPTER XIV THE RETURN HOME WHILE THAT PARTING IN THE WOOD WAS HAPPENING THERE WAS A PARTING IN THE COTTAGE TOO AND LISBETH HAD STOOD WITH ADAM AT THE DOOR STRAINING HER AGED EYES TO GET THE LAST GLIMPSE OF SETH AND DINAH AS THEY MOUNTED THE OPPOSITE SLOPE
A FOOLISH THOUGHT CAME AND MOVED HIM STRANGELY
IF HE'S LAID ON THE SHELF IT'S TO BE HOPED HE'LL MAKE WAY FOR A BETTER MAN BUT I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S LIKE TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME BUT I SEE IT BUT I SEE IT SAID BARTLE AND OTHERS BESIDES ME
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMBER-CHOPPINGS LYING ABOUT AND LOOSE PIECES OF TURF AND A TRUNK OR TWO
IF HE HAD MOVED A MUSCLE HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE SPRUNG UPON ARTHUR LIKE A TIGER
SO HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND SAID IN HIS STRONG VOICE MRS POYSER WITHIN COME IN MR BEDE COME IN MRS POYSER CALLED OUT FROM THE DAIRY
IF I'M EVER MASTER HERE I SHALL DO UP THE GALLERY IN FIRST-RATE STYLE
YOU THINK IT'LL BE A FINE THING FOR THE COUNTRY
HETTY HAD A CERTAIN STRENGTH IN HER VAIN LITTLE NATURE
AND HE MADE FOLKS LOVE HIM AND RESPECT HIM AND THAT WAS BETTER NOR STIRRING UP THEIR GALL WI BEING OVERBUSY
AS LONG AS THEY WERE SILENT THEY DID NOT LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND A FOREBODING CAME ACROSS ADAM THAT IF THEY BEGAN TO SPEAK AS THOUGH THEY REMEMBERED THE PAST--IF THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH FULL RECOGNITION--THEY MUST TAKE FIRE AGAIN
IT'S THE PREACHER AS EMPTIES TH ALEHOUSE
ARTHUR'S SHADOW FLITTED RATHER FASTER AMONG THE STURDY OAKS OF THE CHASE THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE SHADOW OF A TIRED MAN ON A WARM AFTERNOON AND IT WAS STILL SCARCELY FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE TALL NARROW GATE LEADING INTO THE DELICIOUS LABYRINTHINE WOOD WHICH SKIRTED ONE SIDE OF THE CHASE AND WHICH WAS CALLED FIR-TREE GROVE NOT BECAUSE THE FIRS WERE MANY BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE FEW
AND ONE BAD SYMPTOM IS THAT SHE DENIES EVERYTHING--DENIES THAT SHE HAS HAD A CHILD IN THE FACE OF THE MOST POSITIVE EVIDENCE
IT WAS NOT TILL THE FIFTH DAY THAT SHE GOT TO STONY STRATFORD
I HAVE A SCARLET CLOAK BUT THAT IS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHO WINS THIS SPEECH OF MISS LYDIA'S PRODUCED RATHER A MOCKING EXPRESSION IN MRS IRWINE'S FACE AS SHE LOOKED AT ARTHUR WHILE BESSY CAME UP AND DROPPED A SERIES OF CURTSIES
YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE AND ADD WORSE EVILS TO THEM
YOU'RE SUCH A GRAVE STEADY FELLOW YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TEMPTATION TO SUCH TRIFLING
HE MUST HAVE DEFINITE PLANS AND SET ABOUT THEM AT ONCE
GOING ALREADY MRS POYSER SAID OLD MR DONNITHORNE AS SHE CAME TO CURTSY AND TAKE LEAVE
BUT THERE'S NO KNOWIN WHAT'LL COME IF WE'RE T HAVE SUCH PREACHIN'S AS THAT A-GOIN ON IVERY WEEK--THERE'LL BE NO LIVIN I TH VILLAGE
IN EVERY WAY IT WOULD HELP HIM TO TELL IRWINE
A MAN O SENSE--SAYS NO MORE THAN'S NEEDFUL
BUT THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING MY OWN HEALTH DRUNK BY YOU WOULD NOT BE PERFECT IF WE DID NOT DRINK THE HEALTH OF MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAS FILLED THE PLACE OF BOTH PARENTS TO ME
FOR THOUGH HETTY WAS ACCUSTOMED TO MUCH MOVEMENT AND EXERTION INDOORS SHE WAS NOT USED TO LONG WALKS WHICH PRODUCED QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF FATIGUE FROM THAT OF HOUSEHOLD ACTIVITY
YOU KNOW WHAT IS TO HAPPEN THEN AND I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO BE ONE OF THE GUESTS WHO COME EARLIEST AND LEAVE LATEST
ADAM NODDED AND WENT UP TO SETH WHO WAS STANDING A FEW YARDS OFF
HE WAS SILENT LOOKING AT THE CORNER OF THE ROOM AS IF HE SAW SOMETHING THERE
SHE WAS ENOUGH TO TURN ANY MAN'S HEAD
MR IRWINE CAME IN WHILE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT AND HE WOULD HAVE IT AS THE COLONEL MUST SEE NOBODY BUT THEE TO-MORROW
THEN IT'LL BE FOR ALL MY LIFE AN I SHALL NE'ER SEE THEE AGAIN SAID LISBETH
HE HAD BEEN LED ON BY CIRCUMSTANCES
THANK YOUR REVERENCE ANSWERED MR RANN ENDEAVOURING TO LOOK UNCONCERNED ABOUT HIS LEGS BUT SHAKING THEM ALTERNATELY TO KEEP OFF THE PUPPIES
DOUBTLESS A GREAT ANGUISH MAY DO THE WORK OF YEARS AND WE MAY COME OUT FROM THAT BAPTISM OF FIRE WITH A SOUL FULL OF NEW AWE AND NEW PITY
HOWEVER SHE'S A STRAIGHT-BACKED CLEAN WOMAN NONE OF YOUR SLATTERNS
I AM A MAGISTRATE AND CAN GET ADMITTANCE FOR YOU
THAT'S ALL HE CAN DO FOR THE MONEY THEY GIVE HIM
IT MIGHT HA BEEN A TRIFLE THICKER AN NO HARM AN I ALLAYS PUTTEN A SPRIG O MINT IN MYSEN
BUT HAPPEN THEE'DST LIKE A HUSBAND BETTER AS ISNA JUST THE CUT O THYSEN
SICKNESS COMES AND WE FAINT UNDER THE BURDEN OF OUR FEEBLE BODIES
IF THEY MAKE ME SHUDDER AT THE FIRST GLANCE I SAY TAKE THEM AWAY
FOR DEAR HETTY WE MUST TRY TO THINK OF EACH OTHER AS LITTLE AS WE CAN
HETTY WALKED BETWEEN THEM AND BEHIND CAME PATIENT MOLLY WHOSE TASK IT WAS TO CARRY TOTTY THROUGH THE YARD AND OVER ALL THE WET PLACES ON THE ROAD
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WHAT YOU ARE IF YOU HADN'T HAD A BIT OF OLD LAME BARTLE INSIDE YOU
THE BOOK ADAM MOST OFTEN READ ON A SUNDAY MORNING WAS HIS LARGE PICTURED BIBLE AND THIS MORNING IT LAY OPEN BEFORE HIM ON THE ROUND WHITE DEAL TABLE IN THE KITCHEN
THE EATING OF EXCELLENT ROAST BEEF PROVIDED FREE OF EXPENSE WAS TOO SERIOUS A BUSINESS TO THOSE GOOD FARM-LABOURERS TO BE PERFORMED WITH A DIVIDED ATTENTION EVEN IF THEY HAD HAD ANYTHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER--WHICH THEY HAD NOT
IT WAS THAT HE WAS ALWAYS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH LUKE BRITTON THAT SLOVENLY FARMER
YOU'D BEST SET OFF AND WALK AND TRUST TO SUMMAT OVERTAKING YOU EVERY WORD SANK LIKE LEAD ON HETTY'S SPIRITS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MY LOVE FOR YOU IS NOT WEAK FOR MY HEART WAITS ON YOUR WORDS AND LOOKS ALMOST AS A LITTLE CHILD WAITS ON THE HELP AND TENDERNESS OF THE STRONG ON WHOM IT DEPENDS
CONSEQUENCES ARE UNPITYING
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WAS A BEGGAR-WOMAN ONLY FOR HER GOOD CLOTHES
THERE'S NO KNOWIN BUT HE'LL WANT ME HERE LISBETH BROKE FROM WORDS INTO MOANS SWAYING HERSELF BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON HER CHAIR
ON THAT POINT BARTLE WAS MUTE AND IT WAS EVEN A SECRET WHERE HE HAD LIVED PREVIOUS TO THE TWENTY YEARS IN WHICH HAPPILY FOR THE PEASANTS AND ARTISANS OF THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD HE HAD BEEN SETTLED AMONG THEM AS THEIR ONLY SCHOOLMASTER
HIS OBJECTION WAS THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY MY GRANDFATHER
I DON'T SEE THAT IT CAN BE MUCH MORE PROFITABLE THAN HIS PRESENT WORK THOUGH TO BE SURE IT WILL LEAVE HIM A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ON HIS OWN HANDS
NAY NAY ADDY THEE MUSTNA SAY AS ANYBODY'S RELIGION'S LIKE THICK ALE
AND DINAH WAS SO BOUND UP WITH THE SAD MEMORIES OF HIS FIRST PASSION THAT HE WAS NOT FORSAKING THEM BUT RATHER GIVING THEM A NEW SACREDNESS BY LOVING HER
EH DINAH'S GONE TO LEEDS A BIG TOWN YE MAY HA HEARED ON WHERE THERE'S A MANY O THE LORD'S PEOPLE
IT MUST COME AT LAST
MOLLY HASTENED ON WITH SOME ALARM WHEN HETTY HAD COME BACK AND CALLED TO THEM THAT HER AUNT WAS ANGRY
EVERY OTHER HE COULD EVADE BY HOPEFUL SELF-PERSUASION
WHO KNEW THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF PROFANE HISTORY
THEY TOOK T HER WONDERFUL SO AT DAYBREAK ON SUNDAY ADAM SET OFF
I DARESAY SAID MRS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF-WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM-CHAIR--"I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN AS SIT I TH CHIMNEY-CORNER AND MAKE BELIEVE AS EVERYTHING'S CUT WI INS AN OUTS TO FIT INT EVERYTHING ELSE
SO THEY SAT IN SILENCE TILL THE BIT OF WAX CANDLE FLICKERED LOW IN THE SOCKET THE SILENCE ALL THE WHILE BECOMING MORE IRKSOME TO ADAM
GRIM DUSTY ARMOUR HUNG IN HIGH RELIEF IN FRONT OF THE DARK OAKEN GALLERY AT THE FARTHER END AND UNDER THE BROAD ARCH OF THE GREAT MULLIONED WINDOW OPPOSITE WAS SPREAD A CURTAIN OF OLD TAPESTRY COVERED WITH DIM MELANCHOLY FIGURES LIKE A DOZING INDISTINCT DREAM OF THE PAST
ANYBODY UD THINK YOU WAS A WILD WOMAN AN LOOK AT YER HETTY WAS FRIGHTENED AT THIS GRUFF OLD MAN AND STILL MORE AT THIS LAST SUGGESTION THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WILD WOMAN
BUT WHEREVER HETTY CAME HIS MOTHER WAS SURE TO FOLLOW SOON
WHEN A PAUSE CAME HE SAID
ARTHUR WILL HAVE AN EARLY RIDE OVER THE HILL AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM
BUT THE CROCKERY YOU'VE BROKE SIN HERE IN TH HOUSE YOU'VE BEEN UD MAKE A PARSON SWEAR--GOD FORGI ME FOR SAYING SO--AN IF IT HAD BEEN BOILING WORT OUT O THE COPPER IT UD HA BEEN THE SAME AND YOU'D HA BEEN SCALDED AND VERY LIKE LAMED FOR LIFE AS THERE'S NO KNOWING BUT WHAT YOU WILL BE SOME DAY IF YOU GO ON
WHAT FLUCTUATIONS THERE WERE IN HER BUSY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS WHILE MR IRWINE WAS PRONOUNCING THE SOLEMN ABSOLUTION IN HER DEAF EARS AND THROUGH ALL THE TONES OF PETITION THAT FOLLOWED
BUT THEN THE OTHER FOLKS UD COME TO KNOW IT AT LAST AND I COULDN'T BEAR THAT
IT'S NEVER ENTERED HIS HEAD THE THOUGHT O MARRYING YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE TO DO ANYTHING MEAN DASTARDLY OR CRUEL
I COULD BE FAST SURE THAT PICTUR WAS DRAWED FOR HER I THY NEW BIBLE--TH ANGEL A-SITTIN ON THE BIG STONE BY THE GRAVE
HE WAS SILENT
AND UD DO FOR YOU I'LL BE BOUND AS MUCH AS EVER HE'D DO FOR HETTY THOUGH SHE'S HIS OWN NIECE
SHE WAS ALIVE STILL
GREET YOUR MOTHER FOR ME WITH A KISS
WHAT CAN YOU DO BETTER NOR FIGHT EM YE'RE PARTLY RIGHT THERE POYSER SAID MR CRAIG BUT I'M NOT AGAIN THE PEACE--TO MAKE A HOLIDAY FOR A BIT
AND IF A MAN GETS RELIGION HE'LL DO HIS WORK NONE THE WORSE FOR THAT ON'Y HE'LL LAVE THE PANELS OUT O TH DOORS SOMETIMES EH SETH SAID WIRY BEN
WHO SAYS IT GOD GRANT SHE MAY BE INNOCENT ADAM
COME HETTY SAID MARTIN POYSER IN A CONCILIATORY TONE GO AND GET YOUR SUPPER I THE PANTRY AS THE THINGS ARE ALL PUT AWAY
THERE HE IS AGAIN TRUST THEE FOR CATCHING SIGHT OF HIM IF HE'S ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN SAID SETH SMILING
IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD DO FOR THEE AS I DON'T DO AYE AN THAT THERE IS
AN THERE ISN'T MANY AUNTS AS ARE NO KIN TO YOU UD HA DONE BY YOU AS SHE HAS NO IT ISN'T MY AUNT SAID HETTY BUT I SHOULD LIKE THE WORK BETTER IT WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR YOU TO LEARN THE WORK A BIT--AN I GEV MY CONSENT TO THAT FAST ENOUGH SIN MRS POMFRET WAS WILLING TO TEACH YOU
AFTER OUR SUBTLEST ANALYSIS OF THE MENTAL PROCESS WE MUST STILL SAY AS DINAH DID THAT OUR HIGHEST THOUGHTS AND OUR BEST DEEDS ARE ALL GIVEN TO US
SHE WAS PALE AND TREMBLING AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE ANGRILY CONTRADICTED ADAM IF SHE HAD DARED TO BETRAY HER FEELINGS
AND ADAM HAD HARDLY EVER TOUCHED HETTY'S HAND FOR MORE THAN A TRANSIENT GREETING--HAD NEVER DANCED WITH HER BUT ONCE BEFORE
I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY IS LIKELY TO KNOW WHAT'S THE RIGHT LANGUAGE PRETTY NIGH AS WELL AS A SCHOOLMASTER AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU
AND GYP APPARENTLY SATISFIED THAT DUTY AND PLEASURE WERE ONE FOLLOWED LISBETH INTO THE HOUSE-PLACE
THE CRIMSON CLOTH OVER THE LARGE DINING-TABLE IS VERY THREADBARE THOUGH IT CONTRASTS PLEASANTLY ENOUGH WITH THE DEAD HUE OF THE PLASTER ON THE WALLS
AND WHEN WE DESIRE EAGERLY TO FIND SOMETHING WE ARE APT TO SEARCH FOR IT IN HOPELESS PLACES
I'D LIKE HER TO COME IN AN TAKE ME BY TH HAND AGAIN AN TALK TO ME
IT IS ARTHUR DONNITHORNE CARRYING IN HIS HAND A HARD-WON RELEASE FROM DEATH
SHE MAY COME TO FEEL THE VALLY OF A MAN AS UD BE THANKFUL TO BE BOUND TO HER ALL HIS LIFE
WHAT I FEEL FOR HETTY'S A DIFFERENT SORT O LOVE SUCH AS I BELIEVE NOBODY CAN KNOW MUCH ABOUT BUT THEM AS FEEL IT AND GOD AS HAS GIVEN IT TO EM
THERE'S A TABLE FOR THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN BELOW AS WELL
NO IT IS NOT A CLUMP OF TREES BUT A DARK SHROUDED POOL SO FULL WITH THE WINTRY RAINS THAT THE UNDER BOUGHS OF THE ELDER-BUSHES LIE LOW BENEATH THE WATER
THERE WAS A SENSE OF RELIEF FROM WHAT WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE AND THE RARE TEARS CAME--THEY HAD NEVER COME BEFORE SINCE HE HAD HUNG ON SETH'S NECK IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS SORROW
SO HE TOOK UP THE BASKET OF CURRANTS ONCE MORE AND THEY WENT ON TOWARDS THE HOUSE
MRS POYSER DULY SECONDED THE INVITATION FOR SHE WOULD HAVE HELD IT A DEEP DISGRACE NOT TO MAKE HER NEIGHBOURS WELCOME TO HER HOUSE
THEY ARE SO TENDER AND THOUGHTFUL FOR THEIR AGED MOTHER
BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST
IT WAS A SORT OF SCENE WHICH ADAM HAD BEHELD ALMOST WEEKLY FOR YEARS
BUT DINAH'S PRETTIER I THINK WELL THEN IF THEE THINK'ST HER SO PRETTY WHY ARN'T FOND ON HER ADAM LOOKED UP IN SURPRISE
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU FOR I KNOW IT UD BEGIN BY LITTLE AND LITTLE TILL AT LAST YOU'D NOT BE ABLE TO THROW IT OFF
AN IF I'M TH ONLY ONE AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING I THIS PARISH AND THE NEXT TO T FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE--IF IT ISNA TWO-THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE
BUT SHE HAS ONE THING IN THE DRAWER WHICH SHE CAN VENTURE TO WEAR TO-DAY BECAUSE SHE CAN HANG IT ON THE CHAIN OF DARK-BROWN BERRIES WHICH SHE HAS BEEN USED TO WEAR ON GRAND DAYS WITH A TINY FLAT SCENT-BOTTLE AT THE END OF IT TUCKED INSIDE HER FROCK
BUT ADAM HAD VERY IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF THE VALUE OF SUCH THINGS AND HE THOUGHT IT COULD CERTAINLY NOT COST MORE THAN A GUINEA
THE BRIGHT HEARTH AND THE WARMTH AND THE VOICES OF HOME THE SECURE UPRISING AND LYING DOWN THE FAMILIAR FIELDS THE FAMILIAR PEOPLE THE SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS WITH THEIR SIMPLE JOYS OF DRESS AND FEASTING--ALL THE SWEETS OF HER YOUNG LIFE RUSHED BEFORE HER NOW AND SHE SEEMED TO BE STRETCHING HER ARMS TOWARDS THEM ACROSS A GREAT GULF
ADAM TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING ROUND TOO
NOT TO MIND PAIN BECAUSE IT IS OUR FATHER'S WILL
COULD IT BE HER SISTER'S SPIRIT COME BACK TO HER FROM THE DEAD AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
THERE WAS CLEARLY NO GOOD TO BE DONE WITH THIS PART OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT PULLING IT ALL DOWN AND ADAM IMMEDIATELY SAW IN HIS MIND A PLAN FOR BUILDING IT UP AGAIN SO AS TO MAKE THE MOST CONVENIENT OF COW-SHEDS AND CALF-PENS WITH A HOVEL FOR IMPLEMENTS
ADAM HAD BEEN EARLY AT THE CHASE TO KNOW HOW ARTHUR WAS AND HAD BEEN RELIEVED FROM ALL ANXIETY ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF HIS BLOW BY LEARNING THAT HE WAS GONE OUT FOR A RIDE
HER HEART WAS VERY FULL FOR THERE WAS TO BE ONLY ONE MORE NIGHT ON WHICH SHE WOULD LOOK OUT ON THOSE FIELDS FOR A LONG TIME TO COME
I THINK SIR WHEN GOD MAKES HIS PRESENCE FELT THROUGH US WE ARE LIKE THE BURNING BUSH
ON THE INSIDE OF THE COVER ADAM READ
HE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL NOW--THE LOCKET AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD BEEN DOUBTFUL TO HIM
IT WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE TWO PARISHES THAT THE SQUIRE'S PLAN HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE POYSERS HAD REFUSED TO BE PUT UPON AND MRS POYSER'S OUTBREAK WAS DISCUSSED IN ALL THE FARM-HOUSES WITH A ZEST WHICH WAS ONLY HEIGHTENED BY FREQUENT REPETITION
IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH NOW WHAT HE HAD WANTED TO CONFESS
AND WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED AS NEATLY AS USUAL IN HER WORKING-DRESS WITH HER HAIR TUCKED UP UNDER HER LITTLE CAP AN INDIFFERENT OBSERVER WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE STRUCK WITH THE YOUNG ROUNDNESS OF HER CHEEK AND NECK AND THE DARKNESS OF HER EYES AND EYELASHES THAN WITH ANY SIGNS OF SADNESS ABOUT HER
I'D NE'ER OPEN MY LIPS TO FIND FAUT FOR WHEN FOLKS IS OLD AN O NO USE THEY MAY THINK THEIRSENS WELL OFF TO GET THE BIT AN THE SUP THOUGH THEY'N TO SWALLOW ILL WORDS WI'T
HETTY'S HEART GAVE A GREAT BEAT AS SHE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE A POOL THERE
BUT HE WENT ON
HE IS BENDING HIS FACE NEARER AND NEARER TO THE ROUND CHEEK
HETTY WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO HEAR THAT SHE SHOULD NEVER SEE A CHILD AGAIN
AND THOUGH HE WAS STILL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BY HIS OLD SOBRIQUET OF BRIMSTONE THERE WAS NOTHING HE HELD IN SO MUCH HORROR AS ANY FURTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH THAT EVIL-SMELLING ELEMENT
AND THIS IS MY WAY O LOOKING AT IT
THE TRUE CROSS OF THE REDEEMER WAS THE SIN AND SORROW OF THIS WORLD--THAT WAS WHAT LAY HEAVY ON HIS HEART--AND THAT IS THE CROSS WE SHALL SHARE WITH HIM THAT IS THE CUP WE MUST DRINK OF WITH HIM IF WE WOULD HAVE ANY PART IN THAT DIVINE LOVE WHICH IS ONE WITH HIS SORROW
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND CRAIG WAS A KNOWING FELLOW AND HIS VIEW WAS LESS STARTLING
THEE'T LOOKING RARELY NOW AND GETTING FLESH EVERY DAY
IF THE PEOPLE GET A GOOD DINNER AND A MODERATE QUANTITY OF ALE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE GAMES AS THE DAY COOLS
I'LL SPEAK NO WORD TO DISTURB YOU THEY WENT OUT AND WALKED TOWARDS THE FIELDS WHERE THEY WOULD MEET THE FAMILY COMING FROM CHURCH
THERE'S THE STUFF STANDING JUST AS I LEFT IT THIS MORNING DONE THE COFFIN SAID LISBETH FOLLOWING HIM AND KNITTING UNINTERRUPTEDLY THOUGH SHE LOOKED AT HER SON VERY ANXIOUSLY
IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE--THE SMELL'S ENOUGH AH NOW THIS I LIKE SAID MR DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND AT THE DAMP TEMPLE OF CLEANLINESS BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR
SHE MUST THROW IT INTO THE WATER--MAKE IT HEAVY WITH STONES FIRST AND THEN THROW IT IN
ARTHUR DONNITHORNE LOOKED FLUSHED AND EXCITED
THERE WAS A TREMBLING IN HER CLEAR VOICE AS SHE PUT HER HAND INTO HIS AND SAID BE COMFORTED ADAM BEDE THE LORD HAS NOT FORSAKEN HER BLESS YOU FOR COMING TO HER ADAM SAID
NEVERTHELESS ARTHUR FELT HIMSELF VERY HEROIC AS HE STRODE TOWARDS THE STABLES TO GIVE HIS ORDERS ABOUT THE HORSES
BUT I SAID IF YOU LOVED YOUR NEIGHBOUR NO BETTER NOR YOU DO YOURSELF DINAH IT'S LITTLE ENOUGH YOU'D DO FOR HIM
THE HORROR THAT RUSHED OVER ADAM COMPLETELY MASTERED HIM AND FORCED UPON HIM ITS OWN BELIEF
TEN TO ONE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HIM A TASTELESS INDISCREET METHODISTICAL MAN
NO--THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS FOLKS ARE HANGED FOR NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT
BESIDES SHE MUST GO ON SEEMING TO ENCOURAGE ADAM LEST HER UNCLE AND AUNT SHOULD BE ANGRY AND SUSPECT HER OF HAVING SOME SECRET LOVER
BUT THOUGH HE MIGHT NOT SPEAK TO HETTY OF HIS LOVE HE WOULD TELL HER ABOUT HIS NEW PROSPECTS AND SEE IF SHE WOULD BE PLEASED
I DON'T SAY BUT HE MIGHT MAKE EVE TO BE A COMPANION TO ADAM IN PARADISE--THERE WAS NO COOKING TO BE SPOILT THERE AND NO OTHER WOMAN TO CACKLE WITH AND MAKE MISCHIEF THOUGH YOU SEE WHAT MISCHIEF SHE DID AS SOON AS SHE'D AN OPPORTUNITY
IN THE CORPSE WE LOVE IT IS THE LIKENESS WE SEE--IT IS THE LIKENESS WHICH MAKES ITSELF FELT THE MORE KEENLY BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE WAS AND IS NOT
A WOMAN WAS IN THE WITNESS-BOX A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN WHO SPOKE IN A FIRM DISTINCT VOICE
BUT DEVOUT WORSHIPPERS NEVER ALLOW INCONVENIENCES TO PREVENT THEM FROM PERFORMING THEIR RELIGIOUS RITES AND HETTY THIS EVENING WAS MORE BENT ON HER PECULIAR FORM OF WORSHIP THAN USUAL
AND I'M COME TO SEE IF I CAN BE ANY HELP TO YOU IN YOUR TROUBLE
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE WOOD TO THE VILLAGE AND HAVE IT MADE THERE NAY MY LAD NAY LISBETH BURST OUT IN AN EAGER WAILING TONE
HER MANNER BECAME LESS CALM HER UTTERANCE MORE RAPID AND AGITATED AS SHE TRIED TO BRING HOME TO THE PEOPLE THEIR GUILT THEIR WILFUL DARKNESS THEIR STATE OF DISOBEDIENCE TO GOD--AS SHE DWELT ON THE HATEFULNESS OF SIN THE DIVINE HOLINESS AND THE SUFFERINGS OF THE SAVIOUR BY WHICH A WAY HAD BEEN OPENED FOR THEIR SALVATION
HE COULD NEVER DELIBERATELY HAVE TAKEN A STEP WHICH INFLICTED PAIN ON ANOTHER AND LEFT HIMSELF AT EASE
I WOULDNA MIND HA'IN YE FOR A DAUGHTER FOR YE WOULDNA SPEND THE LAD'S WAGE I FINE CLOTHES AN WASTE
ADAM WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THESE INDICATIONS AND AS HIS ANXIETY ABOUT ARTHUR'S CONDITION BEGAN TO BE ALLAYED HE FELT MORE OF THAT IMPATIENCE WHICH EVERY ONE KNOWS WHO HAS HAD HIS JUST INDIGNATION SUSPENDED BY THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE CULPRIT
THERE'S NO MAN COULD LOVE HER BETTER AND LEAVE HER FREER TO FOLLOW THE LORD'S WORK THEY HAD BEEN SILENT FOR MANY MINUTES NOW SINCE THEY HAD DONE TALKING ABOUT BESSY CRANAGE
BUT WHEN SHE CAME TO THE FOURTH MILESTONE THE FIRST SHE HAD HAPPENED TO NOTICE AMONG THE LONG GRASS BY THE ROADSIDE AND READ THAT SHE WAS STILL ONLY FOUR MILES BEYOND STONITON HER COURAGE SANK
AND ONE OF THE FIRST GOOD ACTIONS HE WOULD PERFORM IN THAT FUTURE SHOULD BE TO INCREASE IRWINE'S INCOME FOR THE VICARAGE OF HAYSLOPE SO THAT HE MIGHT KEEP A CARRIAGE FOR HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS
AND THEN HE SAYS IN SOME O THOSE COUNTIES IT'S AS FLAT AS THE BACK O YOUR HAND AND YOU CAN SEE NOTHING OF A DISTANCE WITHOUT CLIMBING UP THE HIGHEST TREES
HE IS ALWAYS LETTING IT GO NEARLY OUT AND THEN PUNISHING IT FOR THAT NEGLIGENCE
WEREN'T YOU PLEASED TO HEAR YOUR HUSBAND MAKE SUCH A GOOD SPEECH TO-DAY OH SIR THE MEN ARE MOSTLY SO TONGUE-TIED--YOU'RE FORCED PARTLY TO GUESS WHAT THEY MEAN AS YOU DO WI THE DUMB CREATURS WHAT
THAT FINE FELLOW HAS BEEN PROPPING UP HIS FATHER FROM RUIN FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP IS ADAM SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE
FOR HE HAD THE MYSTERIOUS SECRET OF NEVER WEARING A NEW-LOOKING COAT
ONE OF THOSE UNTAUGHT WITS THAT HELP TO STOCK A COUNTRY WITH PROVERBS
THE AGITATIONS OF JEALOUSY HAD GIVEN A NEW RESTLESSNESS TO HIS PASSION--HAD MADE FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY TOO HARD ALMOST TO BEAR
THEY'VE MOSTLY GOT FLOWERS OR FEATHERS OR GOLD THINGS I THEIR HAIR BUT SOMEHOW I DON'T LIKE TO SEE EM
IF HE'S BEHAVED ILL GET ANOTHER
I'M A DEVIL OF A FELLOW FOR GETTING MYSELF INTO A HOBBLE BUT I ALWAYS TAKE CARE THE LOAD SHALL FALL ON MY OWN SHOULDERS UNHAPPILY THERE IS NO INHERENT POETICAL JUSTICE IN HOBBLES AND THEY WILL SOMETIMES OBSTINATELY REFUSE TO INFLICT THEIR WORST CONSEQUENCES ON THE PRIME OFFENDER IN SPITE OF HIS LOUDLY EXPRESSED WISH
THEIR STEPS WERE NOISELESS ON THE THICK CARPET OF FIR-NEEDLES AND THE OUTWARD STILLNESS SEEMED TO HEIGHTEN THEIR INWARD CONSCIOUSNESS AS ARTHUR TOOK THE KEY OUT OF HIS POCKET AND PLACED IT IN ADAM'S HAND FOR HIM TO OPEN THE DOOR
ADOLPHUS IRWINE RECTOR OF BROXTON VICAR OF HAYSLOPE AND VICAR OF BLYTHE A PLURALIST AT WHOM THE SEVEREST CHURCH REFORMER WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO LOOK SOUR
AND AFTER ALL IT MATTERED MORE TO HIS WIFE THAN TO HIM
THERE'S SHAPES
WHAT DY'E MANE BY KICKIN FOULKS HERE
YOU'VE QUITE MADE UP YOUR MIND TO GO BACK TO SNOWFIELD O SATURDAY DINAH YES SAID DINAH QUIETLY
IT WAS THE BABY'S CRYING MADE ME GO--AND YET I WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH
I DARESAY I SHOULD HA THOUGHT A PREACHING WOMAN HATEFUL
THEY TAKE LIFE ALMOST AS SLOWLY AS THE SHEEP AND COWS
THEY GO ON WITH THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER COME TO A REASONABLE END
BUT THE POYSERS--MR IRWINE TELLS ME THE POYSERS MEAN TO LEAVE THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE LIVED SO MANY YEARS--FOR GENERATIONS
IF SHE PUT ON A BIT OF PINK RIBBON SHE LOOKED AS YELLOW AS A CROW-FLOWER AND HER HAIR WAS AS STRAIGHT AS A HANK OF COTTON AND ALWAYS WHEN ADAM STAYED AWAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS FROM THE HALL FARM AND OTHERWISE MADE SOME SHOW OF RESISTANCE TO HIS PASSION AS A FOOLISH ONE HETTY TOOK CARE TO ENTICE HIM BACK INTO THE NET BY LITTLE AIRS OF MEEKNESS AND TIMIDITY AS IF SHE WERE IN TROUBLE AT HIS NEGLECT
YOUR LITTLE TOTTY AS WELL AS THE BOYS
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN THE OLD SQUIRE AT WHOM EVERYBODY WAS FRIGHTENED
THERE'S NO SLIPPING UPHILL AGAIN AND NO STANDING STILL WHEN ONCE YOU VE BEGUN TO SLIP DOWN AND THEN THE DAY CAME BACK TO HIM WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE FELLOW AND USED TO RUN BY HIS FATHER'S SIDE PROUD TO BE TAKEN OUT TO WORK AND PROUDER STILL TO HEAR HIS FATHER BOASTING TO HIS FELLOW-WORKMEN HOW THE LITTLE CHAP HAD AN UNCOMMON NOTION O CARPENTERING WHAT A FINE ACTIVE FELLOW HIS FATHER WAS THEN
I CAN EASILY MAKE ANOTHER ARRANGEMENT ABOUT SUPPLYING MY HOUSE
BUT I HATE TO BE TALKING WHERE IT'S NO USE
AS FOR FARMING IT'S PUTTING MONEY INTO YOUR POCKET WI YOUR RIGHT HAND AND FETCHING IT OUT WI YOUR LEFT
A PROPHETESS
I LOOK AT IT AS IF THE DOCTRINES WAS LIKE FINDING NAMES FOR YOUR FEELINGS SO AS YOU CAN TALK OF EM WHEN YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN EM JUST AS A MAN MAY TALK O TOOLS WHEN HE KNOWS THEIR NAMES THOUGH HE'S NEVER SO MUCH AS SEEN EM STILL LESS HANDLED EM
WHAT DOST MANE BY LAVIN ME A WEEK AN NE'ER COOMIN A-NIGH ME DEAR FRIEND SAID DINAH TAKING HER HAND YOU'RE NOT WELL
AND IF I FOLLOWED ONLY MY OWN INCLINATIONS I SHOULD BE WITH HER AT THIS MOMENT INSTEAD OF WRITING
I NIVER REMEMBER A BLUE EYE I MY FAMILY
FOR TOMMY NO LONGER EXPECTANT OF CAKE WAS LIFTING UP HIS EYELIDS WITH HIS FOREFINGERS AND TURNING HIS EYEBALLS TOWARDS TOTTY IN A WAY THAT SHE FELT TO BE DISAGREEABLY PERSONAL
THEY SEPARATED WITH A START--ONE HURRIED THROUGH THE GATE OUT OF THE GROVE AND THE OTHER TURNING ROUND WALKED SLOWLY WITH A SORT OF SAUNTER TOWARDS ADAM WHO STILL STOOD TRANSFIXED AND PALE CLUTCHING TIGHTER THE STICK WITH WHICH HE HELD THE BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER AND LOOKING AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE WITH EYES IN WHICH AMAZEMENT WAS FAST TURNING TO FIERCENESS
AND WHILE HE WAS THERE SOMETHING HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HIM AND MADE HIM GALLOP BACK
OH FOR SHAME TOTTY
I'M SURE YOU WILL WISH TO STAY AND SEE WHAT GOOD CAN BE DONE FOR HER INSTEAD OF GOING ON A USELESS ERRAND OF VENGEANCE
THAT'S WILL MASKERY THE WHEELWRIGHT AND SETH BEDE A YOUNG MAN AS WORKS AT THE CARPENTERIN THE PREACHER COMES FROM TREDDLESTON THEN DOES SHE NAY SIR SHE COMES OUT O STONYSHIRE PRETTY NIGH THIRTY MILE OFF
THE FIRST WORDS SHE LOOKED AT WERE THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE LEFT-HAND PAGE
HE THOUGHT THE CUSTOM OF BAPTISM MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS DOCTRINE AND THAT THE RELIGIOUS BENEFITS THE PEASANT DREW FROM THE CHURCH WHERE HIS FATHERS WORSHIPPED AND THE SACRED PIECE OF TURF WHERE THEY LAY BURIED WERE BUT SLIGHTLY DEPENDENT ON A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LITURGY OR THE SERMON
TELL HER THE TRUTH AND TAKE BLAME TO YOURSELF FOR BEHAVING AS YOU'D NO RIGHT TO DO TO A YOUNG WOMAN AS ISN'T YOUR EQUAL
SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE ONLY SISTER TO DINAH
FETCH A DROP MORE WATER CHAPTER XXXVII THE JOURNEY IN DESPAIR HETTY WAS TOO ILL THROUGH THE REST OF THAT DAY FOR ANY QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED TO HER--TOO ILL EVEN TO THINK WITH ANY DISTINCTNESS OF THE EVILS THAT WERE TO COME
YOU MAY MAKE THE DOOR FAST NOW POYSER
HE WAS A GRACIOUS YOUNG MAN
DOUBTLESS THAT JOY IS WROUGHT UP INTO OUR NATURE AS THE SUNLIGHT OF LONG-PAST MORNINGS IS WROUGHT UP IN THE SOFT MELLOWNESS OF THE APRICOT BUT IT IS GONE FOR EVER FROM OUR IMAGINATION AND WE CAN ONLY BELIEVE IN THE JOY OF CHILDHOOD
BUT YOU WILL STRENGTHEN ME--YOU WILL NOT HINDER ME IN SEEKING TO OBEY TO THE UTTERMOST LET US GO OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE DINAH AND WALK TOGETHER
YOU THINK I'M A CROSS FELLOW AT HOME DINAH HE SAID SMILINGLY
THEE NEEDSTNA BE GI'IN TH DOG SAID LISBETH
BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
SEE THEM IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT INTERRUPTED EVERY NOW AND THEN BY ROLLING MASSES OF CLOUD ASCENDING THE SLOPE FROM THE BROXTON SIDE WHERE THE TALL GABLES AND ELMS OF THE RECTORY PREDOMINATE OVER THE TINY WHITEWASHED CHURCH
IT UD HA BEEN NOTHING TO THIS THERE'S NO KNOWING MY LAD--THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAVE COME
IT DOESN'T COST HIM MUCH TO GIVE US OUR LITTLE HANDFUL OF VICTUAL AND BIT OF CLOTHING
THERE MAY BE A NEW LEADING LET US LEAVE THAT SETH
AND A LARGE BLACK VEIL IS VERY CAREFULLY ADJUSTED OVER THE CROWN OF HER CAP AND FALLS IN SHARP CONTRAST ON THE WHITE FOLDS ABOUT HER NECK
I CANNA TURN HER SAY WHAT I WILL
FOR SLEEP COMES TO THE PERPLEXED--IF THE PERPLEXED ARE ONLY WEARY ENOUGH
THE EVIL CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY LIE FOLDED IN A SINGLE ACT OF SELFISH INDULGENCE IS A THOUGHT SO AWFUL THAT IT OUGHT SURELY TO AWAKEN SOME FEELING LESS PRESUMPTUOUS THAN A RASH DESIRE TO PUNISH
SHE HAD NOT TAKEN THE DREADFUL LEAP
GOOD BOYS DON'T LOOK AFTER THE BIRDS OF A SUNDAY BUT MOTHER SAID MARTY YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE HALF-A-CROWN TO FIND THE SPECKLED TURKEY'S NEST
OUR DEEDS DETERMINE US AS MUCH AS WE DETERMINE OUR DEEDS AND UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN OR WILL BE THE PECULIAR COMBINATION OF OUTWARD WITH INWARD FACTS WHICH CONSTITUTES A MAN'S CRITICAL ACTIONS IT WILL BE BETTER NOT TO THINK OURSELVES WISE ABOUT HIS CHARACTER
SHE'D TAKE A BIG CULLENDER TO STRAIN HER LARD WI AND THEN WONDER AS THE SCRATCHIN'S RUN THROUGH
I'D SOONER CRY NOR LAUGH AT THE SIGHT O THAT POOR THING'S CAP
IF SHE COULD GET INTO THAT HOVEL SHE WOULD BE WARMER
IT WAS HETTY'S SHRIEK
SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM O THE STAIRS AND WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU THINK WELL TO SEE HER FOR SHE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU ABOUT THAT POOR CASTAWAY
HE DETERMINED TO FEEL HIS WAY--TO ASCERTAIN AS WELL AS HE COULD WHAT WAS HETTY'S STATE OF MIND BEFORE HE DECIDED ON DELIVERING THE LETTER
WAS HE REALLY GOING TO HAVE AN EASY LOT AFTER ALL
AND THEN TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE
AS FUR AS I CAN SEE IT'S RAISING VICTUAL FOR OTHER FOLKS AND JUST GETTING A MOUTHFUL FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN AS YOU GO ALONG
ARTHUR'S LIPS WERE NOW AS PALE AS ADAM'S
HOW PRETTY THE ROSES ARE NOW ADAM CONTINUED PAUSING TO LOOK AT THEM
AND I AGREE WITH HER AND APPROVE O WHAT SHE DID SETH WAS SILENT
THE PATRON OF NEW PLOUGHS AND DRILLS THE SEVERE UPBRAIDER OF NEGLIGENT LANDOWNERS AND WITHAL A JOLLY FELLOW THAT EVERYBODY MUST LIKE--HAPPY FACES GREETING HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS OWN ESTATE AND THE NEIGHBOURING FAMILIES ON THE BEST TERMS WITH HIM
A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG BRITON HE LOOKED TO-DAY IN HIGH SPIRITS AND A BRIGHT-BLUE FROCK-COAT THE HIGHEST MODE--HIS ARM NO LONGER IN A SLING
HOW HOT IT IS OUT O THE SHADE
NO HE IS NOT SAID MR IRWINE QUIETLY
ARTHUR WOULD HAVE GONE HOME TO HIS SILK-CURTAINED COT AND HETTY TO HER HOME-SPUN PILLOW AND BOTH WOULD HAVE SLEPT WITHOUT DREAMS AND TO-MORROW WOULD HAVE BEEN A LIFE HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF A YESTERDAY
THE CHILDREN ARE SO HEAVY WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP HETTY WAS GLAD OF THE RELIEF FOR TO HOLD TOTTY IN HER ARMS STANDING WAS NOT AT ALL A PLEASANT VARIETY TO HER
THAT LOOK OF HETTY'S OPPRESSED ARTHUR WITH A DREAD WHICH YET HAD SOMETHING OF A TERRIBLE UNCONFESSED DELIGHT IN IT THAT SHE LOVED HIM TOO WELL
SO THEN ALL THE LOVE THAT JESUS SHOWED TO THE POOR IS THE SAME LOVE THAT GOD HAS FOR US
HE HAD NEVER YET FORFEITED THAT APPROBATION AND HE HAD CONSIDERABLE RELIANCE ON HIS OWN VIRTUES
DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE LORD'S CLEAR BIDDING
AND SHE STILL HUGGED HER SECRET--THAT A GREAT GENTLEMAN LOVED HER--WITH GRATIFIED PRIDE AS A SUPERIORITY OVER ALL THE GIRLS SHE KNEW
HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES--NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR--NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
BUT NOW THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT WRETCHED WOMAN WHOM SHE HAD SEEN HERSELF ON HER WAY FROM CHURCH BEING CARRIED INTO JOSHUA RANN'S CAME BACK UPON HER WITH THE NEW TERRIBLE SENSE THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE NOW TO DIVIDE HER FROM THE SAME LOT
MARTY WAS LETTING THE SCREAMING GEESE THROUGH THE GATE AND WICKEDLY PROVOKING THE GANDER BY HISSING AT HIM
HE ALWAYS TURNS BACK OF HIS OWN HEAD WHEN HE FINDS OUT I'M COMING HERE AYE AYE SAID BARTLE
HER VOICE BECAME DEEP AND MUFFLED BUT THERE WAS STILL NO GESTURE
IT WAS NOT UNTIL SHE FOUND HOW MUCH IT COST HER TO GET TO STONITON THAT SHE BEGAN TO BE ALARMED ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE FELT HER IGNORANCE AS TO THE PLACES THAT MUST BE PASSED ON HER WAY
AS IT WAS BEN ATE HIS ROAST BEEF TO-NIGHT WITH A SERENE SENSE OF HAVING STOLEN NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW PEAS AND BEANS AS SEED FOR HIS GARDEN SINCE THE LAST HARVEST SUPPER AND FELT WARRANTED IN THINKING THAT ALICK'S SUSPICIOUS EYE FOR EVER UPON HIM WAS AN INJURY TO HIS INNOCENCE
I DARESAY SHE'LL COME ROUND AGAIN JOSHUA
YOUR FEELINGS ARE DIFFERENT AND PERHAPS I'M TAKING TOO MUCH UPON ME TO SPEAK ABOUT IT DINAH MADE NO ANSWER AND THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR SOME YARDS TILL THEY CAME TO THE STONE STILE WHERE AS ADAM HAD PASSED THROUGH FIRST AND TURNED ROUND TO GIVE HER HIS HAND WHILE SHE MOUNTED THE UNUSUALLY HIGH STEP SHE COULD NOT PREVENT HIM FROM SEEING HER FACE
I DECEIVED YOU AFTERWARDS--AND THAT LED ON TO WORSE
THREE GUINEAS ANSWERED HETTY FIXING ON THE SUM SHE SET OUT WITH FOR WANT OF ANY OTHER STANDARD AND AFRAID OF ASKING TOO MUCH
HETTY KNEW THAT THEIR MEETING YESTERDAY MUST BE THE LAST BEFORE ARTHUR WENT AWAY--THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEIR CONTRIVING ANOTHER WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION--AND SHE WAS LIKE A FRIGHTENED CHILD UNABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING ONLY ABLE TO CRY AT THE MENTION OF PARTING AND THEN PUT HER FACE UP TO HAVE THE TEARS KISSED AWAY
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW PEOPLE THAT LOOK UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE ANY MORE THAN I WANT TO TASTE DISHES THAT LOOK DISAGREEABLE
SHE FELT NO RESPONSE WITHIN HERSELF TO DINAH'S ANXIOUS AFFECTION
MR BEDE WILL YOU TAKE SOME VINEGAR WITH YOUR LETTUCE
SHE PREACHED ON THE GREEN LAST NIGHT
MRS POYSER HAD LAID THE CLOTH HERSELF--A CLOTH MADE OF HOMESPUN LINEN WITH A SHINING CHECKERED PATTERN ON IT AND OF AN AGREEABLE WHITEY-BROWN HUE SUCH AS ALL SENSIBLE HOUSEWIVES LIKE TO SEE--NONE OF YOUR BLEACHED SHOP-RAG THAT WOULD WEAR INTO HOLES IN NO TIME BUT GOOD HOMESPUN THAT WOULD LAST FOR TWO GENERATIONS
I WAS AFRAID YOU MUST BE ILL FOR THE FIRST TIME I YOUR LIFE
BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS A WOMAN MOST RARELY LEARNS IS NEVER TO TALK TO AN ANGRY OR A DRUNKEN MAN
HER HEART MUST BE JUST AS SOFT HER TEMPER JUST AS FREE FROM ANGLES HER CHARACTER JUST AS PLIANT
GO AN GET YOUR SUPPER THIS MINUTE CHILD
BUT HE'S GOT TONGUE ENOUGH TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFUL ABOUT'S NEEBORS FOR HE SAID AS I WAS A BLIND PHARISEE--A-USIN THE BIBLE I THAT WAY TO FIND NICK-NAMES FOR FOLKS AS ARE HIS ELDERS AN BETTERS!--AND WHAT'S WORSE HE'S BEEN HEARD TO SAY VERY UNBECOMIN WORDS ABOUT YOUR REVERENCE
IT MAY BE WHEN I HAVE ENTERED ON MY FORMER LIFE I SHALL FIND ALL THESE NEW THOUGHTS AND WISHES VANISH AND BECOME AS THINGS THAT WERE NOT
YOU REMEMBER SOME ON EM I THEIR PRIME EH FATHER AYE AYE SAID OLD MARTIN WALKING SLOWLY UNDER THE SHADE OF THE LODGE PORCH FROM WHICH HE COULD SEE THE AGED PARTY DESCEND
HE WOULD HAVE FELT THIS PROBABLY EVEN IF DINAH HAD NOT BEEN WITH THEM BUT HE HAD ONLY SAID THE SIMPLEST TRUTH IN TELLING DINAH THAT HE PUT HER ABOVE ALL OTHER FRIENDS IN THE WORLD
IF HE HAD BEEN GIVEN TO MAKING GENERAL REFLECTIONS IT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS CERTAINLY A CHANGE COME OVER DINAH FOR SHE NEVER USED TO CHANGE COLOUR
IT'S WONDERFUL WHAT A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE HE HAS AND HOW HE'S READY TO USE IT ALL IN BEHALF OF THEM THAT ARE FEEBLE
SHE WAS SHAKEN WITH AN INTENSE THRILL AND FOR THE INSTANT FELT NOTHING ELSE
SHE WOULD HAVE TO SELL HER BASKET AND CLOTHES THEN AND SHE WOULD REALLY LOOK LIKE A BEGGAR OR A WILD WOMAN AS THE MAN HAD SAID
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED
MISS LYDIA'S MAID WOULD HELP HER TO GET A SITUATION IF SHE KNEW HETTY HAD HER UNCLE'S LEAVE
AN THEN WE NEEDNA PART THE PLATTERS AN THINGS AS HA STOOD ON THE SHELF TOGETHER SIN AFORE THEE WAST BORN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CLOUD THAT NOW AND THEN CAME ACROSS ADAM'S SUNSHINE
I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE TOO LITTLE FELLOW-FEELING IN WHAT YOU CONSIDER HIS WEAKNESS ABOUT HETTY TRUST TO ME SIR--TRUST TO ME
INDEED THE EFFECT THEY WOULD HAVE IN THAT CASE ON THE MIND OF THE GROCER'S WIFE HAD PRESENTED ITSELF WITH REMARKABLE VIVIDNESS TO HER RAPID IMAGINATION
PERHAPS HE SUSPECTED THAT SOUR OLD JOHN WAS GRINNING BEHIND HIM--WHICH WAS ALSO THE FACT
SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
BUT IN SPITE OF HER TREMBLING SHE WAS SO EAGER TO ACCOUNT TO THE MAN FOR HER PRESENCE HERE THAT SHE FOUND WORDS AT ONCE
ADAM ARTHUR SAID IMPELLED TO FULL CONFESSION NOW IT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED IF I'D KNOWN YOU LOVED HER
AND I LOOKED ABOUT AMONG THEM BUT COULD FIND NOTHING AND AT LAST THE CRY STOPPED
IT HAD COST ADAM A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND WORK IN OVERHOURS TO KNOW WHAT HE KNEW OVER AND ABOVE THE SECRETS OF HIS HANDICRAFT AND THAT ACQUAINTANCE WITH MECHANICS AND FIGURES AND THE NATURE OF THE MATERIALS HE WORKED WITH WHICH WAS MADE EASY TO HIM BY INBORN INHERITED FACULTY--TO GET THE MASTERY OF HIS PEN AND WRITE A PLAIN HAND TO SPELL WITHOUT ANY OTHER MISTAKES THAN MUST IN FAIRNESS BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNREASONABLE CHARACTER OF ORTHOGRAPHY RATHER THAN TO ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE SPELLER AND MOREOVER TO LEARN HIS MUSICAL NOTES AND PART-SINGING
HETTY CARED LITTLE FOR ANIMALS AS YOU KNOW BUT AT THIS MOMENT SHE FELT AS IF THE HELPLESS TIMID CREATURE HAD SOME FELLOWSHIP WITH HER AND WITHOUT BEING QUITE AWARE OF THE REASON SHE WAS LESS DOUBTFUL ABOUT SPEAKING TO THE DRIVER WHO NOW CAME FORWARD--A LARGE RUDDY MAN WITH A SACK OVER HIS SHOULDERS BY WAY OF SCARF OR MANTLE
AND YOU DON'T KNOW BUT THAT THEY MAY HAVE A BETTER OWNER SOON WHOM YOU WILL LIKE TO WORK FOR
NO LAD I'D RATHER GO ON NOW I'M IN HARNESS
BUT THERE'S AS MANY PLACES FROM HERE TO LONDON AS THERE'S HOUSES IN STONITON BY WHAT I CAN MAKE OUT
A HARD THING EVEN WHEN WE ARE CALLED BY DUTY NOT URGED BY DREAD
BUT NO
IT UD BE A POOR LOOK-OUT IF FOLKS DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID AND SAID WHEN THEY WERE LADS
I DON'T SEE HOW THE THING'S TO BE MADE ANY OTHER THAN HARD
OR AS HE FIXES HIS KEEN BLACK EYES ON THE MOTIONS OF A WORKMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND WARNS HIM THAT HIS DISTANCES ARE NOT RIGHT
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE GIRL THOUGH I THINK--AT LEAST I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT HER LOOK AT HER NEXT SUNDAY AT CHURCH--SHE SITS WITH HER FATHER ON THE LEFT OF THE READING-DESK
SHE MIGHT AS WELL DRESS HERSELF FINE TO SIT BACK'ARDS ON A DONKEY THESE EXPRESSIONS THOUGH FIGURATIVE SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED THE BENT OF MRS POYSER'S MIND WITH REGARD TO ADAM
IT IS THE OVERMASTERING SENSE OF PAIN THAT DRIVES THEM
IT ISNA HATE I RECKON
TAKE ME IN SAID THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF LEADING THE WAY WHILE MRS POYSER FOLLOWED
AND WE MUST FAT PIGS TILL WE'RE OBLIGED TO BEG THE BUTCHER ON OUR KNEES TO BUY EM AND LOSE HALF OF EM WI THE MEASLES
AH IT'S PLAIN ENOUGH WHAT SORT OF BUSINESS IT IS SAID THE WIFE
THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE NOISE OF THE TOASTS BUT IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR THEM NOT TO SEE YOU AT TABLE HE WALKED ON SPEAKING TO THE MOTHERS AND PATTING THE CHILDREN WHILE MR IRWINE SATISFIED HIMSELF WITH STANDING STILL AND NODDING AT A DISTANCE THAT NO ONE'S ATTENTION MIGHT BE DISTURBED FROM THE YOUNG SQUIRE THE HERO OF THE DAY
AND THEE'ST GOT EARS AS UD FIND IT OUT IF A MOUSE WAS GNAWING THE BACON
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S HAD HER FIRST HEARTACHE
AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW-SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW-BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
BUT LORD BLESS YOU THEY WOULDN'T GIVE YOU A QUARTER O WHAT THE THINGS ARE WORTH
I'VE ONLY GOT THE GROUND-FLOOR OF THE HOUSE AND THE KITCHEN AND BEDROOM BOTH LOOK INTO THE ALLEY
MUCH TO THE REGRET OF THE BOYS AND TOTTY
BUT AFTER THE SECOND TAP THE DOOR WAS OPENED IMMEDIATELY
POOR POOR MOTHER
DINAH WAS NOT SATISFIED WITHOUT A MORE UNMISTAKABLE GUIDANCE THAN THOSE INWARD VOICES
I SAW HER MYSELF AND SHE WAS OBSTINATELY SILENT TO ME
IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE PAST UNDONE AND KNOWN NO OTHER LOVE THAN HER QUIET LIKING FOR ADAM
RUN LISBETH RUN TO MEET AUNT POYSER
I OWE YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT
SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG
I TOLD THE MOTHER IN THE DAY-TIME SHE MUST TELL ME THE NAME OF HER FRIENDS AND WHERE THEY LIVED AND LET ME WRITE TO THEM
BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
HOW MUCH MORE EDIFYING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF YOU HAD MADE HIM GIVE ARTHUR SOME TRULY SPIRITUAL ADVICE
BUT I'VE HAD MY SAY OUT AND I SHALL BE TH EASIER FOR'T ALL MY LIFE
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE PARTICULARLY HOW HE LOOKED CALL TO YOUR REMEMBRANCE SOME TAWNY-WHISKERED BROWN-LOCKED CLEAR-COMPLEXIONED YOUNG ENGLISHMAN WHOM YOU HAVE MET WITH IN A FOREIGN TOWN AND BEEN PROUD OF AS A FELLOW-COUNTRYMAN--WELL-WASHED HIGH-BRED WHITE-HANDED YET LOOKING AS IF HE COULD DELIVER WELL FROM THE LEFT SHOULDER AND FLOOR HIS MAN
THE TERRIBLE DECISION OF ADAM'S TONE SHOOK HER WITH FEAR
THE POYSERS HAD NOT THE SHADOW OF A SUSPICION
THE LIGHTS WERE CHARMINGLY DISPOSED IN COLOURED-PAPER LAMPS HIGH UP AMONG GREEN BOUGHS AND THE FARMERS WIVES AND DAUGHTERS AS THEY PEEPED IN BELIEVED NO SCENE COULD BE MORE SPLENDID
AN HE SO WISE AT BOOKIN AN FIGURIN AN NOT TO KNOW NO BETTER NOR THAT BUT MOTHER THEE KNOW'ST WE CANNA LOVE JUST WHERE OTHER FOLKS UD HAVE US
THEY'LL ALL GO SOON FOR TH MISSIS NIVER LETS EM STAY PAST TEN BUT ADAM WAS RESOLUTE SO THE GOOD-NIGHTS WERE SAID AND THE TWO FRIENDS TURNED OUT ON THEIR STARLIGHT WALK TOGETHER
AND HOW ARE YOU MRS POYSER?--THINKING O GETHERIN THE RED CURRANTS SOON I RECKON
THE STRANGER WHO HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN THE COURSE OF HER SERMON AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DRAMA--FOR THERE IS THIS SORT OF FASCINATION IN ALL SINCERE UNPREMEDITATED ELOQUENCE WHICH OPENS TO ONE THE INWARD DRAMA OF THE SPEAKER'S EMOTIONS--NOW TURNED HIS HORSE ASIDE AND PURSUED HIS WAY WHILE DINAH SAID LET US SING A LITTLE DEAR FRIENDS
THERE WAS NOT ANY REASON FOR THRUSTING THE WHOLE BURDEN ON ADAM AT ONCE AND MR IRWINE AT PARTING ONLY SAID IF THE EVIDENCE SHOULD TELL TOO STRONGLY AGAINST HER ADAM WE MAY STILL HOPE FOR A PARDON
THE UNNATURALNESS OF HER CRIME STOOD OUT THE MORE HARSHLY BY THE SIDE OF HER HARD IMMOVABILITY AND OBSTINATE SILENCE
FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM--THERE'S LESS O SELF IN HER AND PRIDE
IT'S BECAUSE O THY BEING APPOINTED OVER THE WOODS AND IT'S NOTHING BUT WHAT'S RIGHT
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN
ADAM DON'T TRY TO MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR ME
REASONS WHY HE COULD NOT MARRY HER HAD NO EXISTENCE FOR HER MIND
IF IT'S WRONG IT'S SUMMAT IN THE MEAL OR IT'S SUMMAT IN THE MILK OR IT'S SUMMAT IN THE WATER
ONE BEGINS TO SUSPECT AT LENGTH THAT THERE IS NO DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN EYELASHES AND MORALS
BUT ADAM BEDE AND ALL HIS KIN MIGHT BE DROWNDED FOR WHAT YOU'D CARE--YOU'D BE PERKING AT THE GLASS THE NEXT MINUTE ADAM BEDE--DROWNED SAID HETTY LETTING HER ARMS FALL AND LOOKING RATHER BEWILDERED BUT SUSPECTING THAT HER AUNT WAS AS USUAL EXAGGERATING WITH A DIDACTIC PURPOSE
YOU KNOW IT COULDN'T BE MADE PUBLIC AS YOU'VE BEHAVED TO HETTY AS Y HAVE DONE WITHOUT HER LOSING HER CHARACTER AND BRINGING SHAME AND TROUBLE ON HER AND HER RELATIONS
DIDN'T HE SCOLD YOU FOR PREACHING NO HE WAS NOT AT ALL ANGRY
BUT REALLY THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HER PETTISHNESS
PLEASANT THE SENSE OF BEING HURRIED ALONG IN SWIFT EASE THROUGH ENGLISH SCENES SO LIKE THOSE ROUND HIS OWN HOME ONLY NOT QUITE SO CHARMING
BUT THEY'RE GOING AWAY NOW T HAVE THEIR DINNER I RECKON
AND THEN THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE THE POYSERS TO WHOM A GOOD NAME WAS AS PRECIOUS AS IF THEY HAD THE BEST BLOOD IN THE LAND IN THEIR VEINS--HE SHOULD HATE HIMSELF IF HE MADE A SCANDAL OF THAT SORT ON THE ESTATE THAT WAS TO BE HIS OWN SOME DAY AND AMONG TENANTS BY WHOM HE LIKED ABOVE ALL TO BE RESPECTED
HIS HONEST PATRONIZING PRIDE IN THE GOOD-WILL AND RESPECT OF EVERYBODY ABOUT HIM WAS A SAFEGUARD EVEN AGAINST FOOLISH ROMANCE STILL MORE AGAINST A LOWER KIND OF FOLLY
IN FACT SHE FELT A MOMENTARY ANNOYANCE AND ALARM FOR SHE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD IT HINTED BY HER UNCLE THAT ADAM MIGHT HAVE MARY BURGE AND A SHARE IN THE BUSINESS ANY DAY IF HE LIKED THAT SHE ASSOCIATED THE TWO OBJECTS NOW AND THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED THAT PERHAPS ADAM HAD GIVEN HER UP BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED LATELY AND HAD TURNED TOWARDS MARY BURGE
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MRS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD STAY AT THE HALL FARM ALL THAT EVENING
THE REASON IS THAT MILD PEOPLE ARE MOST LIABLE TO BE UNDER THE YOKE OF TRADITIONAL IMPRESSIONS
I SHALL TAKE YOU WITH ME PYM AND SET OFF THIS MORNING
NOW SHE WOULD READ HER LETTER
I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU MY WORK--IT'S BEEN DONE IN MY OWN TIME AND NOBODY'S GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT ME
SHE KNEW QUITE WELL WHOM HE HAD IN HIS MIND IN HIS ALLUSIONS TO MARRIAGE AND TO A SOBER SOLID HUSBAND
THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT HAVE HARDLY ANY ROOTS
SHIPS CERTAINLY ARE LIABLE TO CASUALTIES WHICH SOMETIMES MAKE TERRIBLY EVIDENT SOME FLAW IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN DISCOVERABLE IN SMOOTH WATER
I WAS QUITE TAKEN BY SURPRISE
SHE'LL NE'ER MARRY THEE
THE WIND HAD FALLEN NOW AND THERE WAS ONLY ENOUGH BREEZE TO STIR THE DELICATE-STEMMED LEAVES
HE HAD THE LETTER IN HIS POCKET AND WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING TO HETTY ALONE
HE WAS THE ONLY OBJECT MOVING ON THE WIDE COMMON
I SHALL SLEEP LONG ENOUGH BY AND BY UNDERGROUND
BUT YOU MAY COME TO FEEL SATISFIED...TO FEEL THAT YOU MAY COME TO ME AGAIN AND WE MAY NEVER PART DINAH WE MUST SUBMIT OURSELVES ADAM
A MAN WHO HAS NO FEELING FOR THE CLASSICS COULDN'T MAKE A BETTER APOLOGY FOR COMING INTO THE WORLD THAN BY INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF FOOD TO MAINTAIN SCHOLARS--AND RECTORS WHO APPRECIATE SCHOLARS
YOU'LL STAY AND BE MY DEAR WIFE AND I SHALL THANK GOD FOR GIVING ME MY LIFE AS I NEVER THANKED HIM BEFORE ADAM IT'S HARD TO ME TO TURN A DEAF EAR...YOU KNOW IT'S HARD
NO GENTLEMAN OUT OF A BALLAD COULD MARRY A FARMER'S NIECE
THERE WAS NO AGITATION VISIBLE IN HER BUT A DEEP CONCENTRATED CALMNESS AS IF EVEN WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING HER SOUL WAS IN PRAYER REPOSING ON AN UNSEEN SUPPORT
THEIR LIVES HAVE NO DISCERNIBLE ECHO BEYOND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY DWELT BUT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO FIND THERE SOME GOOD PIECE OF ROAD SOME BUILDING SOME APPLICATION OF MINERAL PRODUCE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN FARMING PRACTICE SOME REFORM OF PARISH ABUSES WITH WHICH THEIR NAMES ARE ASSOCIATED BY ONE OR TWO GENERATIONS AFTER THEM
I'M HARD--IT'S IN MY NATURE
IT WAS A LOW HOUSE WITH SMOOTH GREY THATCH AND BUFF WALLS LOOKING PLEASANT AND MELLOW IN THE EVENING LIGHT
OTHER WOMEN OF HER SORT HAVE MARRIED--THAT'S TO SAY NOT JUST LIKE HER BUT WOMEN AS PREACHED AND ATTENDED ON THE SICK AND NEEDY
AND IF I WERE TO MARRY YOU NOW I SHOULD ONLY BE ADDING TO ANY WRONG I HAVE DONE BESIDES OFFENDING AGAINST MY DUTY IN THE OTHER RELATIONS OF LIFE
MR POYSER WAS IN HIS SUNDAY SUIT OF DRAB WITH A RED-AND-GREEN WAISTCOAT AND A GREEN WATCH-RIBBON HAVING A LARGE CORNELIAN SEAL ATTACHED PENDANT LIKE A PLUMB-LINE FROM THAT PROMONTORY WHERE HIS WATCH-POCKET WAS SITUATED
HER FATHER WON'T HAVE HER SAID NAY IN ANYTHING AND THERE'S NO MANAGING HER
IT WAS NOT HEAVY MASSIVE MERELY RIPPLING HAIR BUT SOFT AND SILKEN RUNNING AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY INTO DELICATE RINGS
LET ALL THY CONVERSE BE SINCERE THY CONSCIENCE AS THE NOONDAY CLEAR
COME LET US GO UP ABOVE NOW AND SEE THE DINNER-TABLES FOR THE LARGE TENANTS THEY WENT UP THE STONE STAIRCASE LEADING SIMPLY TO THE LONG GALLERY ABOVE THE CLOISTERS A GALLERY WHERE ALL THE DUSTY WORTHLESS OLD PICTURES HAD BEEN BANISHED FOR THE LAST THREE GENERATIONS--MOULDY PORTRAITS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH AND HER LADIES GENERAL MONK WITH HIS EYE KNOCKED OUT DANIEL VERY MUCH IN THE DARK AMONG THE LIONS AND JULIUS CAESAR ON HORSEBACK WITH A HIGH NOSE AND LAUREL CROWN HOLDING HIS COMMENTARIES IN HIS HAND
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF IT
AND THEN HE DIDN'T KEEP WITHIN HIS INCOME FOR HE SEEMED TO THINK AT FIRST GO-OFF THAT SIX HUNDRED A-YEAR WAS TO MAKE HIM AS BIG A MAN AS MR DONNITHORNE
I SEND THIS LETTER TO MEET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL ARTHUR BECAUSE I MAY THEN BE AT STONITON WHITHER I AM CALLED BY THE MOST PAINFUL DUTY IT HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO PERFORM AND IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WITHOUT DELAY
THE ADVANTAGE PERHAPS WOULD HAVE BEEN ON BESSY'S SIDE IN THE MATTER OF FEELING
MILLS WAS STILL THERE BUT ARTHUR DID NOT SEE HIM AS HE PASSED LIKE A HUNTED MAN ACROSS THE HALL AND OUT ALONG THE GRAVEL
DO YOU FEEL ANY HURT SIR ADAM SAID AGAIN WITH A TREMBLING IN HIS VOICE
IT'S HIS WORK...SHE WAS A CHILD AS IT UD HA GONE T ANYBODY'S HEART TO LOOK AT...I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE'S DONE...IT WAS HIM BROUGHT HER TO IT
HIS EYES WHEN THEY RESTED ON HER HAD AN UNEASY QUESTIONING EXPRESSION IN THEM
THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE EAR-RINGS WITH THEIR DELICATE PEARLS AND GARNET THAT SHE HAD TRIED IN HER EARS WITH SUCH LONGING IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE ON THE 30TH OF JULY
MOTHER'S DONE HER IRONING NOW
THEE'T WORK THYSELF TO DEATH
AND I KNOW HE WOULD MAKE TWICE THE MONEY OF THEM THAT MY GRANDFATHER DOES WITH THAT MISERABLE OLD SATCHELL TO MANAGE WHO UNDERSTANDS NO MORE ABOUT TIMBER THAN AN OLD CARP
I KNEW A MAN AS HIS FATHER HAD A PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE O THE FRENCH
I DECLARE I'VE GOT FIVE LITTLE ROUND SILVER THINGS AND HEAR WHAT A PRETTY NOISE THEY MAKE IN TOTTY'S PINK POCKET HERE HE SHOOK THE POCKET WITH THE FIVE SIXPENCES IN IT AND TOTTY SHOWED HER TEETH AND WRINKLED HER NOSE IN GREAT GLEE
HE WAS GETTING IN LOVE WITH HETTY--THAT WAS QUITE PLAIN
BUT THINK OF THIS
I NEVER FORGOT WHAT I OWED YOU WHEN I WAS A LAD
HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE THE REPAIRS WERE ORDERED TO BE EXECUTED WITH ALL DISPATCH AND ADAM ACTING FOR MR BURGE WAS CARRYING OUT THE ORDER WITH HIS USUAL ENERGY
BUT WHEN I MENTIONED THE SUBJECT TO ADAM HE LOOKED UNEASY AND TURNED THE CONVERSATION
DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SHE SAID WITH A SUDDENLY LOWERED TONE AFTER A MOMENT'S BEWILDERED GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
BOOK SIX CHAPTER XLIX AT THE HALL FARM THE FIRST AUTUMNAL AFTERNOON SUNSHINE OF 1801--MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THAT PARTING OF ADAM AND ARTHUR IN THE HERMITAGE--WAS ON THE YARD AT THE HALL FARM
WHILE ARTHUR WAS HESITATING THE ROPE TO WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE CLUNG HAD DRIFTED AWAY--HE MUST TRUST NOW TO HIS OWN SWIMMING
HE WAS GOING TO INQUIRE AT THE PLACE WHERE THE OAKBOURNE COACH STOPPED
IF HER TONGUE'S KEEN HER HEART'S TENDER
IT HAD FALLEN ON THE RAISED WOODEN DAIS WHERE THE BAND SAT NOT ON THE STONE FLOOR
I CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS LOTS OF CHIPS AND TURF AND I SAT DOWN ON THE TRUNK OF A TREE TO THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO
AND THESE RELIGIOUS DEFICIENCIES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A CORRESPONDING SLACKNESS IN THE MINOR MORALS FOR BESSY BELONGED UNQUESTIONABLY TO THAT UNSOAPED LAZY CLASS OF FEMININE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM YOU MAY VENTURE TO EAT AN EGG AN APPLE OR A NUT ALL THIS SHE WAS GENERALLY CONSCIOUS OF AND HITHERTO HAD NOT BEEN GREATLY ASHAMED OF IT
HIS FACE HAS GOT THINNER THIS LAST WEEK
HE'S ALLAYS PUT UP HIS HOSS HERE SIR IVER SINCE BEFORE I HED THE DONNITHORNE ARMS
YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBOURS CAN GO ON TAKING YOUR POT OF BEER SOBERLY WHEN YOU'VE DONE YOUR DAY'S WORK LIKE GOOD CHURCHMEN
AND HE SPOKE VERY TENDERLY TO POOR SINNERS THAT WERE SORRY FOR THEIR SINS
BUT I KNOW BETTER NOR TO TAKE EM TO SAY MY OWN SAY WI I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE SACRIMENT-CUP HOME AND USE IT AT MEALS THAT'S A VERY SENSIBLE REMARK OF YOURS JOSHUA
BUT AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I WAS SAYING THAT PRETTY METHODIST PREACHER I MENTIONED JUST NOW TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD PREACHED TO THE ROUGHEST MINERS AND HAD NEVER BEEN TREATED WITH ANYTHING BUT THE UTMOST RESPECT AND KINDNESS BY THEM
HETTY WAS QUITE CERTAIN HER UNCLE WANTED HER TO ENCOURAGE ADAM AND WOULD BE PLEASED FOR HER TO MARRY HIM
AND AS TO THE BARGAINS ABOUT THE SQUIRE'S TIMBER IT WOULD BE EASY TO CALL IN A THIRD PERSON
BUT HIS COUNTENANCE IS AS PLEASANT AS THE MORNING SUNSHINE PLEASANT
BUT YOU WERE SUCH A BROAD-FACED BROAD-CHESTED LOUD-SCREAMING RASCAL I KNEW YOU WERE EVERY INCH OF YOU A TRADGETT BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE TOO HASTY THERE MOTHER SAID MR IRWINE SMILING
AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF HE'S BACK AGAIN TO-MORROW
I HOPE YOU HAVE NO OBJECTIONS AGAINST ME FOR HER HUSBAND SAID ADAM
I WAS IN NO BAD COMPANY SHE'S GONE ADAM--GONE TO SNOWFIELD SAID MR POYSER REMINDED OF DINAH FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS EVENING
FOR THE BEAUTY OF A LOVELY WOMAN IS LIKE MUSIC
AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT REQUIRE OF HIM THAT HE SHOULD FEEL ANY VEXATION IN OBSERVING A POUTING EXPRESSION ON HETTY'S FACE AS SHE LISTENED TO THE GARDENER'S SMALL TALK
BUT NOW HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THE HEAVIEST PART OF HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED AND THAT EVEN BEFORE THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO A SHAPE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO THINK OF MARRYING
AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT-HAND WINDOW
ARTHUR WOULD SOON JOIN HIS REGIMENT AND BE FAR AWAY
CARROLL COMING BACK RECALLED ADAM TO THE SENSE OF HIS BURDEN
WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME LAD BARTLE SAID
IN TEN MINUTES FROM THAT TIME ADAM WAS AT THE DOOR OF THE CELL
BUT YOU MUST HAVE A CUP O TEA FIRST CHILD SAID MRS POYSER FALLING AT ONCE FROM THE KEY OF B WITH FIVE SHARPS TO THE FRANK AND GENIAL C
AND THERE WAS NO COACH TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OAKBOURNE THAT DAY
TO BE CRYING AGAIN--WHAT DID GENTLEMEN THINK OF GIRLS WHO CRIED IN THAT WAY
FOR HE MUST LOVE HER VERY MUCH--NO ONE ELSE HAD EVER PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER AND KISSED HER IN THAT WAY
HETTY'S WAS A SPRING-TIDE BEAUTY
HERE'S THE CLERK COMING WITH HIS FIDDLE AND A SMART FELLOW WITH A NOSEGAY IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE NO SAID ARTHUR
TOWARDS THE YOUNG SQUIRE THIS INSTINCTIVE REVERENCE OF ADAM'S WAS ASSISTED BY BOYISH MEMORIES AND PERSONAL REGARD SO YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT HE THOUGHT FAR MORE OF ARTHUR'S GOOD QUALITIES AND ATTACHED FAR MORE VALUE TO VERY SLIGHT ACTIONS OF HIS THAN IF THEY HAD BEEN THE QUALITIES AND ACTIONS OF A COMMON WORKMAN LIKE HIMSELF
THEE'ST NOT HALF SO GOOD REASON TO THINK AS ADAM ULL GO AWAY AS TO THINK HE'LL STAY WITH THEE
MR IRWINE HAD FOLLOWED HIM AND NOW TOOK HIM BY THE ARM SAYING IN A QUIET BUT DECIDED TONE NO ADAM NO
I'D HA BEEN ASHAMED TO LET THE WORDS PASS OVER MY LIPS IF I'D BEEN YOU
SHE FELT A STRANGE CONTRADICTORY WRETCHEDNESS AND EXULTATION
LET EVIL WORDS DIE AS SOON AS THEY'RE SPOKEN
BUT YOU WILL SEE THEM ALL--YOU WILL COME UP WITH ME AFTER DINNER I HOPE YES TO BE SURE SAID MR IRWINE
THIS IS A SACRED GROVE
I DIDN'T SEND FOR A DOCTOR FOR THERE SEEMED NO NEED
FOR IN ALL OTHER AFFECTION I HAD BEEN CONTENT WITH ANY SMALL RETURN OR WITH NONE
EVERY BLADE OF GRASS WAS ASLEEP
FINE OLD LEISURE
SHE WAS ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE THIS CARESS BECAUSE WHEN SHE FIRST WENT UP TO HIM HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR TO LOOK AT HER AFFECTIONATELY AND SAY WHY MOTHER THEE LOOK'ST RARE AND HEARTY THIS MORNING
SHE WAS SUCH A YOUNG THING AND SHE COULDN'T HELP LOVING FINERY
IT WAS PART OF THAT DECENT BURIAL WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A GREATER WRONG TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THAN TO HAVE CAUSED HIM MANY UNHAPPY DAYS WHILE HE WAS LIVING
YOUR MOTHER IS NOT ILL AGAIN I HOPE ADAM DINAH SAID RECOVERING HERSELF
FOR HE SAT THERE IN SPITE OF THE FIRE BECAUSE HE KNEW HIS MOTHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM WITH HER AND IT WAS THE ONLY DAY IN THE WEEK WHEN HE COULD INDULGE HER IN THAT WAY
THAT IS A LONG AND HARD LESSON AND ADAM HAD AT PRESENT ONLY LEARNED THE ALPHABET OF IT IN HIS FATHER'S SUDDEN DEATH WHICH BY ANNIHILATING IN AN INSTANT ALL THAT HAD STIMULATED HIS INDIGNATION HAD SENT A SUDDEN RUSH OF THOUGHT AND MEMORY OVER WHAT HAD CLAIMED HIS PITY AND TENDERNESS
IT'S HIM I BLAME FOR STEALING YOUR LOVE I THAT WAY WHEN HE KNEW HE COULD NEVER MAKE YOU THE RIGHT AMENDS
SHE THOUGHT IF ADAM HAD BEEN RICH AND COULD HAVE GIVEN HER THESE THINGS SHE LOVED HIM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
HE'LL BE AS HAPPY AS A KING NOW MR IRWINE COULD NOT HELP GIVING A SLIGHT GROAN
I'LL SEND IT OVER TO YOU
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR POOR LISBETH TO KNOW HOW IT AFFECTED ADAM ANY MORE THAN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A WOUNDED DOG TO KNOW HOW HIS MOANS AFFECT THE NERVES OF HIS MASTER
IT UD HAPPEN WEAR OUT ON HER WI MARRYIN ADAM THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED AT HIS MOTHER
EH MY LAD MY LAD LISBETH BURST OUT IMMEDIATELY HER WAILING IMPULSE RETURNING FOR GRIEF IN ITS FRESHNESS FEELS THE NEED OF ASSOCIATING ITS LOSS AND ITS LAMENT WITH EVERY CHANGE OF SCENE AND INCIDENT THEE'ST GOT NOBODY NOW BUT THY OLD MOTHER TO TORMENT THEE AND BE A BURDEN TO THEE
AS SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE MILESTONE SHE FELT SOME DROPS FALLING ON HER FACE--IT WAS BEGINNING TO RAIN
STRANGE THAT TILL THAT MOMENT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR EVER BEING LOVERS HAD NEVER CROSSED HIS MIND AND YET NOW ALL HIS LONGING SUDDENLY WENT OUT TOWARDS THAT POSSIBILITY
WOMEN WHO ARE NEVER BITTER AND RESENTFUL ARE OFTEN THE MOST QUERULOUS
SHE HAD A SICKENING SENSE THAT NO LOT COULD EVER BE PLEASANT TO HER AGAIN IF HER THURSDAY NIGHT'S VISION WAS NOT TO BE FULFILLED
HERE'S A BAD BUSINESS I SUSPECT SAID THE LANDLORD AS HE BROUGHT IN SOME WATER
THEY DREW LOTS AND SOUGHT FOR DIVINE GUIDANCE BY OPENING THE BIBLE AT HAZARD
THE LITTLE UNS ADDRESSED WERE MARTY AND TOMMY BOYS OF NINE AND SEVEN IN LITTLE FUSTIAN TAILED COATS AND KNEE-BREECHES RELIEVED BY ROSY CHEEKS AND BLACK EYES LOOKING AS MUCH LIKE THEIR FATHER AS A VERY SMALL ELEPHANT IS LIKE A VERY LARGE ONE
IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SPEAKING THEORETICALLY HE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SAID THAT THE ONLY HEALTHY FORM RELIGION COULD TAKE IN SUCH MINDS WAS THAT OF CERTAIN DIM BUT STRONG EMOTIONS SUFFUSING THEMSELVES AS A HALLOWING INFLUENCE OVER THE FAMILY AFFECTIONS AND NEIGHBOURLY DUTIES
THERE'S NO LIKELIHOODS OF A DROP NOW
THE SCHOOLMASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WHAT'S RIGHT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S GOOD DOESN'T ALTER HER SHAME AND MISERY WELL LAD WELL SAID BARTLE IN A GENTLE TONE STRANGELY IN CONTRAST WITH HIS USUAL PEREMPTORINESS AND IMPATIENCE OF CONTRADICTION IT'S LIKELY ENOUGH I TALK FOOLISHNESS
AND I THOUGHT JUST AT FIRST SHE WAS ALMOST ANGRY WITH ME FOR GOING EH IT'S A POOR LOOK-OUT WHEN TH OULD FOLKS DOESNA LIKE THE YOUNG UNS SAID OLD MARTIN BENDING HIS HEAD DOWN LOWER AND SEEMING TO TRACE THE PATTERN OF THE QUARRIES WITH HIS EYE
BUT THE STRONG KNOTTED OLD OAKS HAD NO BENDING LANGUOR IN THEM--THE SIGHT OF THEM WOULD GIVE A MAN SOME ENERGY
WHY IT'S GETTING ON TOWARDS EIGHT YEARS SINCE THEY PARTED YES SAID DINAH ADAM WAS GREATLY MOVED THIS MORNING AT THE THOUGHT OF THE CHANGE HE SHOULD SEE IN THE POOR YOUNG MAN FROM THE SICKNESS HE HAS UNDERGONE AS WELL AS THE YEARS WHICH HAVE CHANGED US ALL
BUT MRS POYSER'S WISHES WERE QUITE THE REVERSE OF THIS FOR HER MIND WAS FILLED WITH DREARY FOREBODINGS AS TO THE RETARDATION OF TO-MORROW MORNING'S CHEESE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE LATE HOURS
BUT AS TO THIAS BEDE HE'S BETTER OUT O THE WAY NOR IN--GOD FORGI ME FOR SAYING SO--FOR HE'S DONE LITTLE THIS TEN YEAR BUT MAKE TROUBLE FOR THEM AS BELONGED TO HIM
THE MISSIS WUNNA HAVE IT A BIT LATER AYE SAID ADAM I'LL COME IF I CAN
THERE'S A NICE BIT O COLD PUDDING I THE SAFE--JUST WHAT YOU'RE FOND OF HETTY COMPLIED SILENTLY BY GOING TOWARDS THE PANTRY AND MRS POYSER WENT ON SPEAKING TO DINAH
ARTHUR FELT THERE WAS NOT AIR ENOUGH IN THE ROOM TO SATISFY HIS RENOVATED LIFE WHEN HE HAD READ THAT PASSAGE IN THE LETTER
AUNT LYDIA WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE HOUSE WHO KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HETTY
THE VAINEST WOMAN IS NEVER THOROUGHLY CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN BEAUTY TILL SHE IS LOVED BY THE MAN WHO SETS HER OWN PASSION VIBRATING IN RETURN
DO NOT BE SEVERE UPON HIM AND JUDGE HIM BY OUR MODERN STANDARD
THEE'T MADE TO BE LOVED--FOR WHERE'S THERE A STRAIGHTER CLIVERER MAN
I WOULDN'T HA MINDED IF YOU'D BEEN MR POYSER'S OWN NIECE--FOLKS MUST PUT UP WI THEIR OWN KIN AS THEY PUT UP WI THEIR OWN NOSES--IT'S THEIR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
MOVEMENT WITH SOME OBJECT BEFORE HIM WAS THE BEST MEANS OF COUNTERACTING THE VIOLENCE OF SUFFERING IN THESE FIRST HOURS
SHE'S NOT A COMMON FLAUNTING DRATCHELL I CAN SEE THAT
AND IN THE COTTAGE TOO FOR SHE HAD COME AT EVERY SPARE MOMENT TO SOOTHE AND CHEER POOR LISBETH WHO HAD BEEN STRICKEN WITH A FEAR THAT SUBDUED EVEN HER QUERULOUSNESS AT THE SIGHT OF HER DARLING ADAM'S GRIEF-WORN FACE
BUT I THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WOULDN'T DIE--THERE MIGHT SOMEBODY FIND IT
THAT SHOWS ME THERE'S DEEP SPERITIAL THINGS IN RELIGION
IT'LL BE A GOOD WHILE AFORE MY HEAD'S FULL O TH METHODIES SAID BEN
I SAW HER AS PLAIN AS WE SEE THAT BIT OF THIN WHITE CLOUD LIFTING UP HER POOR THIN HAND AND BECKONING TO ME
SHE HAD GONE A LITTLE FARTHER INTO THE FIELDS AFTER COMING FROM TREDDLESTON BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO IN SHE SAID
WITH YOUR LEAVE MADAM I'LL BID YOU GOOD-MORNING I MADE MY BOW AND WENT OUT BEFORE SHE'D TIME TO SAY ANY MORE FOR SHE STOOD WITH THE PURSE IN HER HAND LOOKING ALMOST FOOLISH
AND THE NEIGHBOURS FROM HAYSLOPE WHO WERE PRESENT AND WHO TOLD HETTY SORREL'S STORY BY THEIR FIRESIDES IN THEIR OLD AGE NEVER FORGOT TO SAY HOW IT MOVED THEM WHEN ADAM BEDE POOR FELLOW TALLER BY THE HEAD THAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE ROUND HIM CAME INTO COURT AND TOOK HIS PLACE BY HER SIDE
AND AS I'VE SAID TO MY HUSBAND OFTEN AND OFTEN I'M SURE IF THE CAPTAIN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT IT WOULDN'T BE SO
IT WAS NOT FIVE O'CLOCK
THERE'S ONE ABOVE KNOWS BETTER NOR US AH SAID MRS POYSER AN IT'S POOR WORK ALLAYS SETTIN THE DEAD ABOVE THE LIVIN WE SHALL ALL ON US BE DEAD SOME TIME I RECKON--IT UD BE BETTER IF FOLKS UD MAKE MUCH ON US BEFOREHAND I'STID O BEGINNIN WHEN WE'RE GONE
NATURE HAS TAKEN CARE THAT HE SHALL NEVER GO FAR ASTRAY WITH PERFECT COMFORT AND SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF
AND TO ADAM THIS PALE HARD-LOOKING CULPRIT WAS THE HETTY WHO HAD SMILED AT HIM IN THE GARDEN UNDER THE APPLE-TREE BOUGHS--SHE WAS THAT HETTY'S CORPSE WHICH HE HAD TREMBLED TO LOOK AT THE FIRST TIME AND THEN WAS UNWILLING TO TURN AWAY HIS EYES FROM
SHE'S A PERFECT HEBE
BUT YOU MIGHT BE PUT ABOUT BY FINDING THINGS MEDDLED WITH
THAT FINE OLD LADY HERSELF WAS WORTH DRIVING TEN MILES TO SEE ANY DAY
AND NO WONDER THEY SHOWED THIS EAGER INTEREST ON HER MARRIAGE MORNING FOR NOTHING LIKE DINAH AND THE HISTORY WHICH HAD BROUGHT HER AND ADAM BEDE TOGETHER HAD BEEN KNOWN AT HAYSLOPE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN
TELL HIM WHAT IS IN YOUR HEART HETTY OBEYED HER LIKE A LITTLE CHILD
ADAM STARTED TO HIS FEET AND STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS TOWARDS HER
THERE'S NOTHING SEEMS TO GIVE HER A TURN I TH INSIDE NOT EVEN WHEN WE THOUGHT TOTTY HAD TUMBLED INTO THE PIT
THEE KNOW'ST NOUGHT ABOUT IT
BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION
NOT AS YOU'D CARE MUCH I DARESAY IF YOU DID HEAR
HIS HANDS WERE THRUST IN HIS SIDE POCKETS AND HIS EYES RESTED CHIEFLY ON THE GROUND
YOU THINK IF I UNDERTAKE TO DO A BIT O WORK I'LL DO IT WELL BE MY PAY BIG OR LITTLE--AND THAT'S TRUE
NOW LAD SAID ADAM AS SETH MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE COFFIN'S DONE AND WE CAN TAKE IT OVER TO BROX'ON AND BE BACK AGAIN BEFORE HALF AFTER SIX
ROOM WAS SILENTLY MADE FOR HIM TO DEPART AND HE WENT TO HIS CHAMBER IN LONELINESS LEAVING BARTLE MASSEY TO WATCH AND SEE THE END
A PAUSE CAME HOWEVER WHEN HE HAD TO TAKE UP HIS RULER AND NOW AGAIN CAME THE STRANGE RAP AND AGAIN GYP HOWLED
A MAN MUST LEARN SUMMAT BESIDE GOSPEL TO MAKE THEM THINGS I RECKON
BUT SHE PUSHED IT ALL BACKWARD TO LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE AND FORM A DARK CURTAIN THROWING INTO RELIEF HER ROUND WHITE NECK
THE TWO FRIENDS WERE FREE FROM THE NECESSITY OF FURTHER CONVERSATION TILL THEY PULLED UP IN THE LANE BEHIND ADAM'S COTTAGE
BUT THIS SECOND TRANSFER HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EFFECT OF ROUSING TOTTY WHO WAS NOT BEHIND ANY CHILD OF HER AGE IN PEEVISHNESS AT AN UNSEASONABLE AWAKING
SHE COULD SEE QUITE WELL THE PEGS IN THE OLD PAINTED LINEN-PRESS ON WHICH SHE HUNG HER HAT AND GOWN
THIS WOMAN'S KIN WOULDN'T LIKE HER TO DEMEAN HERSELF TO A COMMON CARPENTER TCHU SAID BEN WITH A LONG TREBLE INTONATION WHAT'S FOLKS'S KIN GOT TO DO WI'T
IF YOU DIDNA MEAN TO STAY WI ME YOU'D BETTER NEVER HA COME
LIKING THE AFTERNOON SERVICE BEST BECAUSE THE PRAYERS WERE THE SHORTEST AND NOT ASHAMED TO SAY SO
BUT IT WAS NOT A SHOUT OF EXECRATION--NOT A YELL OF EXULTANT CRUELTY
NOT A WORD MORE WAS SPOKEN AS THEY GATHERED THE CURRANTS
SHE WISHED HE TOO MIGHT KNOW DESOLATION AND COLD AND A LIFE OF SHAME THAT HE DARED NOT END BY DEATH
THERE WAS A PLACE CUT INTO IT WHERE I COULD MAKE ME A BED AND I LAY COMFORTABLE AND THE BABY WAS WARM AGAINST ME
NOTHING BUT THE DESIRE TO GET A TENANT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE SQUIRE'S UNDERTAKING REPAIRS THOUGH THE SATURDAY-EVENING PARTY AT MR CASSON'S AGREED OVER THEIR PIPES THAT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES WOULD TAKE THE CHASE FARM UNLESS THERE WAS A BIT MORE PLOUGHLAND LAID TO IT
IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE SHIFTING HIS TACTICS AND LOOKING AS IF HE THOUGHT MRS POYSER HAD SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN FROM THE PROCEEDINGS AND LEFT THE ROOM YOU CAN TURN THE HOLLOWS INTO FEEDING-LAND
BUT I MUST GO UPSTAIRS FIRST AND SEE ANNE
UNDER THIS NAME TOO THEY WERE USED WITH GREAT EFFECT AS A MEANS OF TAMING REFRACTORY CHILDREN SO THAT AT THE SIGHT OF POOR MISS ANNE'S SALLOW FACE SEVERAL SMALL URCHINS HAD A TERRIFIED SENSE THAT SHE WAS COGNIZANT OF ALL THEIR WORST MISDEMEANOURS AND KNEW THE PRECISE NUMBER OF STONES WITH WHICH THEY HAD INTENDED TO HIT FARMER BRITTON'S DUCKS
I MAY HAVE MORE STRENGTH TO BEAR IT IF I KNOW IT MUST BE
HAPPEN THEY'RE DEAD TOO THERE SAID DINAH NOW THE KITCHEN LOOKS TIDY AND NOW DEAR MOTHER--FOR I'M YOUR DAUGHTER TO-NIGHT YOU KNOW--I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO WASH YOUR FACE AND HAVE A CLEAN CAP ON
AND I HOPE YOU WILL BY AND BY JOIN ME IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AND IN WISHING HIM ALL THE PROSPERITY IN LIFE THAT HE DESERVES
BUT YOU SEE ADAM AS HAS GOT ONE O THE BEST HEAD-PIECES HEREABOUT KNOWS BETTER
BUT THERE ARE NO END OF PEOPLE HERE THAT I DON'T KNOW FOR THEY'RE GROWN UP AND ALTERED SO SINCE I USED TO GO ABOUT WHAT EXCELLENT SIGHT YOU HAVE SAID OLD MR DONNITHORNE WHO WAS HOLDING A DOUBLE GLASS UP TO HIS EYES TO SEE THE EXPRESSION OF THAT YOUNG MAN'S FACE SO FAR OFF
AND HER DARK FACE WITH ITS DELICATE AQUILINE NOSE FIRM PROUD MOUTH AND SMALL INTENSE BLACK EYE IS SO KEEN AND SARCASTIC IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT YOU INSTINCTIVELY SUBSTITUTE A PACK OF CARDS FOR THE CHESS-MEN AND IMAGINE HER TELLING YOUR FORTUNE
AND FOR SOME TIME AFTER HIS ARRIVAL THERE SEEMED TO BE QUITE A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT IN THAT QUIET RURAL DISTRICT
IT'LL DO YOU NO GOOD TO SIT IN A SPRING-CART O YOUR OWN IF YOU'VE GOT A SOFT TO DRIVE YOU
RIGHT ON ALONG THE PATH AND SHE WOULD GET TO IT
SETH THOUGHT SHE WILL BE QUIETER BY AND BY NOW WE HAVE BEEN UPSTAIRS
YOU BEGIN TO FEEL MORE YOURSELF AGAIN SIR HE SAID AS THE CANDLE WENT OUT AND THEY WERE HALF-HIDDEN FROM EACH OTHER IN THE FAINT MOONLIGHT
HE'S BEEN A SELFISH TALE-BEARING MISCHIEVOUS FELLOW
I DOUBT THEY'LL BE RUSTED
HIS ARM WAS ROUND HER AND THE DELICATE ROSE-SCENT OF HIS HAIR WAS WITH HER STILL
THEY MUN MAKE WAY FOR THE YOUNG UNS I SHOULD HA THOUGHT THE BIGGEST TENANT HAD THE BEST RIGHT MORE NOR TH OLDEST SAID LUKE BRITTON WHO WAS NOT FOND OF THE CRITICAL MR POYSER
AND THINK--THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AS IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER
WEAKNESSES AND ERRORS MUST BE FORGIVEN--ALAS
THERE WAS BUT ONE RESOURCE
SHE HAD THE TIMIDITY OF A LUXURIOUS PLEASURE-SEEKING NATURE WHICH SHRINKS FROM THE HINT OF PAIN
I NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF SINCE I WAS A MISSIS AND I NEVER WILL
COME UNCLE SETH SAID DINAH
BUT WOODEN FOLKS HAD NEED HA WOODEN THINGS T HANDLE
WELL WHATEVER HAD BEEN AMISS IN HIM HE WAS MISERABLE ENOUGH IN CONSEQUENCE
THE SILENCE SEEMED LONG BEFORE SHE WENT ON
I DON'T KNOW NOW I COME TO THINK ON'T WHAT THERE IS MUCH FOR A WOMAN TO LIKE ABOUT ME
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT AS A RULE SENSIBLE MEN FALL IN LOVE WITH THE MOST SENSIBLE WOMEN OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE SEE THROUGH ALL THE PRETTY DECEITS OF COQUETTISH BEAUTY NEVER IMAGINE THEMSELVES LOVED WHEN THEY ARE NOT LOVED CEASE LOVING ON ALL PROPER OCCASIONS AND MARRY THE WOMAN MOST FITTED FOR THEM IN EVERY RESPECT--INDEED SO AS TO COMPEL THE APPROBATION OF ALL THE MAIDEN LADIES IN THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD
BUT SETH'S AS GOOD-HEARTED A LAD AS EVER HANDLED A TOOL AND PLENTY O SENSE AND GOOD-LOOKING TOO
ADAM UD HA DONE FOR THEE--I KNOW HE WOULD--AN HE MIGHT COME T LIKE THEE WELL ENOUGH IF THEE'DST STOP
I WISH IT HAD BEEN SOMETHING MORE TO HER TASTE SHE'S A BOLD-LOOKING YOUNG PERSON OBSERVED MISS LYDIA
HE WAS AFRAID SHE SHOULD THINK HE HAD LECTURED HER IMAGINING AS WE ARE APT TO DO THAT SHE HAD PERCEIVED ALL THE THOUGHTS HE HAD ONLY HALF-EXPRESSED
BUT I DON'T WANT TO PART WITH AN OLD TENANT LIKE YOU TO BE THRUST OUT OF THE DISCUSSION IN THIS WAY WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO COMPLETE MRS POYSER'S EXASPERATION EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT
PART OF THE NEXT MORNING WAS CONSUMED IN INQUIRIES AT EVERY HOUSE IN THE TOWN FROM WHICH A COACH STARTED--(ALL IN VAIN FOR YOU KNOW HETTY DID NOT START FROM STONITION BY COACH BUT ON FOOT IN THE GREY MORNING)--AND THEN IN WALKING OUT TO THE FIRST TOLL-GATES ON THE DIFFERENT LINES OF ROAD IN THE FORLORN HOPE OF FINDING SOME RECOLLECTION OF HER THERE
I SHOULD LIKE TO WALK HOME WITH YOU ONCE MORE
THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE BE WITH THEM DINAH PRAYED AS SHE LOOKED BACK FROM THE LAST STILE
BUT I GO THROUGH THE CHASE SOMETIMES AND DON'T YOU EVER GO TO SEE MRS BEST THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND THE PRESSURE OF THIS THOUGHT SOON BECAME TOO STRONG FOR HER TO ENJOY THE UNRESPONDING STILLNESS OF THE MOONLIT FIELDS
BUT THAT'S THE WAY
BARTLE MASSEY HAD CONSENTED TO ATTEND THE WEDDING AT ADAM'S EARNEST REQUEST UNDER PROTEST AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL AND THE MARRIAGE OF A SENSIBLE MAN IN PARTICULAR
SHE HESITATED NO LONGER BUT OPENING HER OWN DOOR GENTLY WENT AND TAPPED ON HETTY'S
WHY MOTHER HE SAID HOW IS IT AS FATHER'S WORKING SO LATE IT'S NONE O THY FEYTHER AS IS A-WORKIN'--THEE MIGHT KNOW THAT WELL ANOOF IF THY HEAD WARNA FULL O CHAPELLIN'--IT'S THY BROTHER AS DOES IVERYTHING FOR THERE'S NIVER NOBODY ELSE I TH WAY TO DO NOTHIN LISBETH WAS GOING ON FOR SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF SETH AND USUALLY POURED INTO HIS EARS ALL THE QUERULOUSNESS WHICH WAS REPRESSED BY HER AWE OF ADAM
DOST THINK SHE WILL NAY SAID MRS POYSER NOT SUFFICIENTLY ON HER GUARD AGAINST A POSSIBLE SURPRISE SHE'LL NEVER MARRY ANYBODY IF HE ISN'T A METHODIST AND A CRIPPLE IT UD HA BEEN A PRETTY THING THOUGH FOR EM T MARRY SAID MARTIN TURNING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS IF IN PLEASED CONTEMPLATION OF HIS NEW IDEA
IT IS SO MUCH PRETTIER AS WELL AS SHORTER THAN COMING BY EITHER OF THE LODGES YES SIR HETTY ANSWERED WITH A TREMULOUS ALMOST WHISPERING VOICE
DON'T TELL ME WE MUST PART AND PASS OUR LIVES AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER THE TEARS WERE TREMBLING IN DINAH'S EYES AND THEY FELL BEFORE SHE COULD ANSWER
I HOPE MY MOTHER WAS THANKFUL TO HAVE YOU HE ADDED WONDERING RATHER ANXIOUSLY WHAT HAD BEEN DINAH'S RECEPTION
IT ISNA MANY FOLKS I SEND FOR T COME AN SEE ME
ALICK WAS OF OPINION THAT CHURCH LIKE OTHER LUXURIES WAS NOT TO BE INDULGED IN OFTEN BY A FOREMAN WHO HAD THE WEATHER AND THE EWES ON HIS MIND
DID YOU THINK I WOULDN'T COME TO YOU IN TROUBLE HETTY KEPT HER EYES FIXED ON DINAH'S FACE--AT FIRST LIKE AN ANIMAL THAT GAZES AND GAZES AND KEEPS ALOOF
YOU SEEMED VERY FRIGHTENED ABOUT IT
I'N GOT MY BED LAID I TH LITTLE ROOM O'ER THE BACK KITCHEN AN YE CAN LIE BESIDE ME
I HATE THE SOUND OF WOMEN'S VOICES
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO MEET HETTY AGAIN
THE FURTHER I SEE THEE ABOVE ME THE BETTER SO LONG AS THEE FEEL'ST LIKE A BROTHER TO ME
THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER AH SAID MRS POYSER RISING AND WALKING TOWARDS THE DOOR I KNOW IT UD BE JUST THE SAME IF I WAS TO TALK TO YOU FOR HOURS
UNTIL TO-DAY SHE HAD NEVER LOOKED FARTHER INTO THE FUTURE THAN TO THE NEXT TIME CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE WOULD COME TO THE FARM OR THE NEXT SUNDAY WHEN SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AT CHURCH
I'M COME TO BE WITH YOU HETTY--NOT TO LEAVE YOU--TO STAY WITH YOU--TO BE YOUR SISTER TO THE LAST SLOWLY WHILE DINAH WAS SPEAKING HETTY ROSE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND WAS CLASPED IN DINAH'S ARMS
IT'S NO HARM FOR ME TO BE A BIT FIERY AND STIFF-BACKED--I'M AN OLD SCHOOLMASTER AND SHALL NEVER WANT TO GET ON TO A HIGHER PERCH
SHE WOULD WANDER OUT OF SIGHT AND DROWN HERSELF WHERE HER BODY WOULD NEVER BE FOUND AND NO ONE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER
IT DONNA SMELL SHE WHISPERED THINKING THIS WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE WHICH OLD SALTS HAD OVER FRESH ONES
IN HIS TALL STALWARTNESS ADAM BEDE WAS A SAXON AND JUSTIFIED HIS NAME
YOU'D BETTER TAKE CARE ON'T ELSE YOU'LL GET IT STOOL FROM YER IF YOU GO TRAPESIN ABOUT THE FIELDS LIKE A MAD WOMAN A-THATWAY THE MAN LEFT HER WITHOUT FURTHER SPEECH AND HETTY HELD ON HER WAY
MR IRWINE THINKS HE'S IN THE RIGHT NOT TO COME
SHE'S FAINTING SAID THE LANDLADY HASTENING TO SUPPORT HETTY WHO HAD LOST HER MISERABLE CONSCIOUSNESS AND LOOKED LIKE A BEAUTIFUL CORPSE
IF I WERE GOING TO STAY HERE AND ACT AS LANDLORD HE ADDED PRESENTLY WITH STILL MORE EAGERNESS--"IF I WERE CARELESS ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE--WHAT I'VE BEEN THE CAUSE OF YOU WOULD HAVE SOME EXCUSE ADAM FOR GOING AWAY AND ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO GO
AND I'LL GO SO FAR WITH THE STRONGEST METHODIST EVER YOU'LL FIND
LISBETH NOTICED THAT HE WAS MOVED
DO NOT WRITE UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN REALLY DO FOR YOU
THE MONEY GAINED IN THIS WAY WITH THE GOOD WAGES HE RECEIVED AS FOREMAN WOULD SOON ENABLE THEM TO GET BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD SO SPARINGLY AS THEY WOULD ALL LIVE NOW
POSSIBLY THERE WAS SOME SUCH UNRECOGNIZED AGENT SECRETLY BUSY IN ARTHUR'S MIND AT THIS MOMENT--POSSIBLY IT WAS THE FEAR LEST HE MIGHT HEREAFTER FIND THE FACT OF HAVING MADE A CONFESSION TO THE RECTOR A SERIOUS ANNOYANCE IN CASE HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE QUITE TO CARRY OUT HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS
HER KITCHEN ALWAYS LOOKED THE PINK OF CLEANLINESS BUT THIS MORNING SHE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY BENT ON MAKING HER HEARTH AND BREAKFAST-TABLE LOOK COMFORTABLE AND INVITING
WITH THIS LAST DETERMINATION ON HIS MIND OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ARTHUR THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD SPENT TWO DAYS IN INQUIRIES WHICH HAD PROVED TO BE ALMOST USELESS WAS TORTURING TO ADAM
HE HAD NO SOONER FOUND HIMSELF IN MR IRWINE'S PRESENCE THAN THE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT QUITE EASY BEFORE SUDDENLY APPEARED THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IN THE WORLD TO HIM AND AT THE VERY MOMENT OF SHAKING HANDS HE SAW HIS PURPOSE IN QUITE A NEW LIGHT
I'VE SAID ENOUGH A'READY ABOUT YOUR BRINGING SUCH DISGRACE UPO YOUR UNCLE'S FAMILY
HE COULD FORM NO GUESS ABOUT THE LIGHT HAIR UNDER IT FOR HE HAD NOT SEEN IT VERY DISTINCTLY
INDEED THEIR INTERCOURSE WAS CONFINED TO AN OCCASIONAL SNARL FOR THOUGH THEY PROBABLY DIFFERED LITTLE CONCERNING HEDGING AND DITCHING AND THE TREATMENT OF EWES THERE WAS A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THEM AS TO THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE MERITS
I'M CALLED THERE
WHY THE SCOTCH TUNES ARE JUST LIKE A SCOLDING NAGGING WOMAN BARTLE WENT ON WITHOUT DEIGNING TO NOTICE MR CRAIG'S REMARK
ADAM BEDE WHO WAS PRESENT IN ONE OF THE LARGE MARQUEES WHERE THE PLAN WAS BEING DISCUSSED TOLD BEN HE HAD BETTER NOT MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF--A REMARK WHICH AT ONCE FIXED BEN'S DETERMINATION
AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE FIELDS ADAM VENTURED TO OFFER HIS ARM TO HETTY
YOU'LL SLEEP NOW YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANYTHING TO LISTEN FOR MR IRWINE GAVE UP HIS INTENTION OF SENDING A LETTER TO MEET ARTHUR SINCE IT WOULD NOT NOW HASTEN HIS RETURN
COULD IT BE ALL OVER
HETTY PUSHED IT AWAY PEEVISHLY
THAT WAS AN UGLY FAULT IN ARTHUR'S LIFE THAT AFFAIR LAST SUMMER BUT THE FUTURE SHOULD MAKE AMENDS
BOOK FIVE CHAPTER XXXVI THE JOURNEY OF HOPE A LONG LONELY JOURNEY WITH SADNESS IN THE HEART
I COULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I FELT FOR YOU
IF ADAM HAD BEEN AS AISY AS THEE HE'D NIVER HA HAD NO MONEY TO PAY FOR THEE
YOU CAN SO SELDOM GET HOLD OF A MAN AS CAN TURN HIS BRAINS TO MORE NOR ONE THING
POOR BESSY HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A NAUGHTY GIRL
SHE'D HA HELPED TO PACIFY HER AUNT A BIT DINAH WASN'T AT SNOWFIELD
THERE WAS AN INVISIBLE SPECTATOR WHOSE EYE RESTED ON HER LIKE MORNING ON THE FLOWERS
I USED TO BE HARD SOMETIMES
I CAN PUT UP WI HER ADAM WAS LOOKING AT HETTY AND SAW THE FROWN AND POUT AND THE DARK EYES SEEMING TO GROW LARGER WITH PETTISH HALF-GATHERED TEARS
SHE WAS NEVER AWAY FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE FOR MORE THAN A DAY
NO THAT SCREW CAN WAIT SAID ADAM HAMMERING AWAY AGAIN
RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES HAD TAKEN NO HOLD ON HETTY'S MIND
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE WISE ON THE SUBJECT OF EAR-RINGS AS ONE LOOKS AT HER
AND NOW THERE WAS A NEW LEAF TO BE TURNED OVER AND IT WAS A PICTURE--THAT OF THE ANGEL SEATED ON THE GREAT STONE THAT HAS BEEN ROLLED AWAY FROM THE SEPULCHRE
AND IT TOUCHED THE TENDEREST FIBRE IN BARTLE MASSEY'S NATURE FOR SUCH FULL-GROWN CHILDREN AS THESE WERE THE ONLY PUPILS FOR WHOM HE HAD NO SEVERE EPITHETS AND NO IMPATIENT TONES
HE IS GLAD TO SEE THE PROMISE OF SETTLED WEATHER NOW FOR GETTING IN THE HAY ABOUT WHICH THE FARMERS HAVE BEEN FEARFUL
IF HE SHOULD NOT COME
BY JOVE HE'S GOING TO DANCE
HE WAS STILL MORE SURPRISED WHEN HE SAW THAT ADAM HAD NOT MOVED BUT STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO HIM AS IF SUMMONING HIM TO RETURN
AN YOU SEE WHAT THE WOMEN ULL THINK ON YOU WELL SAID MR CRAIG WILLING TO CONCILIATE MRS POYSER AND SETTING A HIGH VALUE ON HIS OWN COMPLIMENTS I LIKE A CLEVERISH WOMAN--A WOMAN O SPERRIT--A MANAGING WOMAN YOU'RE OUT THERE CRAIG SAID BARTLE DRYLY
I'D NEVER THINK O PUTTING MYSELF BETWEEN YOU AND GOD AND SAYING YOU OUGHTN'T TO DO THIS AND YOU OUGHTN'T TO DO THAT
I ASKED HER TO SIT DOWN AND GAVE HER SOME TEA AND ASKED HER WHERE SHE WAS GOING AND WHERE HER FRIENDS WERE
IT WAS A REGULAR ROAD THROUGH THE FIELDS AND NOTHING VERY UNCOMMON TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN THERE BUT I TOOK NOTICE OF HER BECAUSE SHE LOOKED WHITE AND SCARED
BUT WHEN SHE TOOK UP THE CRUSHED LETTER AND PUT IT IN HER DRAWER THAT SHE MIGHT LOCK IT OUT OF SIGHT HARD SMARTING TEARS HAVING NO RELIEF IN THEM AS THE GREAT DROPS HAD THAT FELL LAST NIGHT FORCED THEIR WAY INTO HER EYES
SUCH THINGS MAKE A SCAR DO WHAT WE WILL
ADAM HAD NOT YET TURNED TOWARDS HER THERE WAS A DEEP HORROR LIKE A GREAT GULF BETWEEN THEM
GOD HAVE MERCY ON US ADDY HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE SITTING DOWN ON THE BENCH BESIDE ADAM WHAT IS IT ADAM WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK
WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING THE LANDLORD HAD COME IN AND HAD BEGUN TO LOOK AT HER AS EARNESTLY AS HIS WIFE HAD DONE
BUT PRESENTLY DENT BRINGS UP A POOR FELLOW WHO HAS KILLED A HARE AND WHEN I'VE GOT THROUGH MY JUSTICING AS CARROLL CALLS IT I'M INCLINED FOR A RIDE ROUND THE GLEBE AND ON MY WAY BACK I MEET WITH THE MASTER OF THE WORKHOUSE WHO HAS GOT A LONG STORY OF A MUTINOUS PAUPER TO TELL ME
I WENT TO WINDSOR--I RAN AWAY--DID YOU KNOW
BUT AS GOD HAS DISTRIBUTED TO EVERY MAN AS THE LORD HATH CALLED EVERY MAN SO LET HIM WALK GOD HAS CALLED ME TO MINISTER TO OTHERS NOT TO HAVE ANY JOYS OR SORROWS OF MY OWN BUT TO REJOICE WITH THEM THAT DO REJOICE AND TO WEEP WITH THOSE THAT WEEP
I WOULDN'T HAVE HER DIFFERENT
MR AND MRS POYSER PAUSED A MINUTE AT THE CHURCH GATE
IT WAS FREE INDEED FROM THE MODERN BLEMISH OF GALLERIES
THERE WAS KESTER BALE FOR EXAMPLE BEALE PROBABLY IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN BUT HE WAS CALLED BALE AND WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY CLAIM TO A FIFTH LETTER THE OLD MAN WITH THE CLOSE LEATHER CAP AND THE NETWORK OF WRINKLES ON HIS SUN-BROWNED FACE
THERE WAS NOTHING NOW TO HINDER ADAM FROM SETTING OFF
COME AS EARLY AS YOU CAN AND HETTY'S FOOLISH JOYS AND HOPES WHICH HAD FLOWN AWAY FOR A LITTLE SPACE SCARED BY A MERE NOTHING NOW ALL CAME FLUTTERING BACK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE REAL PERIL
AND WITH WICKEDNESS OF ANY SORT MARTIN POYSER WAS QUITE CLEAR THAT HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO SINCE MONEY GOT BY SUCH MEANS WOULD NEVER PROSPER
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SEEN ANY BEING WHOSE FACE SEEMED TO REFLECT THE CHANGE IN HERSELF
SHE STARTED WHEN SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT SOME ONE WAS NEAR--STARTED SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE DROPPED THE BASIN WITH THE CURRANTS IN IT AND THEN WHEN SHE SAW IT WAS ADAM SHE TURNED FROM PALE TO DEEP RED
SHE'S A LITTLE OVERCOME"--FOR HETTY'S TEARS WERE FALLING FAST
GONE ALONG WI HER SHE SAID
THESE PLEASANT THOUGHTS ABOUT ARTHUR BROUGHT A MILDER EXPRESSION THAN USUAL INTO HIS KEEN ROUGH FACE
AND A BAD HEADACHE THAT STILL HUNG ABOUT HIM THIS MORNING ACCOUNTED FOR HIS PALENESS AND HEAVY EYES
BUT THE BAKER'S DAUGHTER GOES HOME AND DREAMS OF THE HANDSOME YOUNG EMPEROR AND PERHAPS WEIGHS THE FLOUR AMISS WHILE SHE IS THINKING WHAT A HEAVENLY LOT IT MUST BE TO HAVE HIM FOR A HUSBAND
MARTY THE ELDEST WAS A BABY WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO THE FARM FOR THE CHILDREN BORN BEFORE HIM HAD DIED AND SO HETTY HAD HAD THEM ALL THREE ONE AFTER THE OTHER TODDLING BY HER SIDE IN THE MEADOW OR PLAYING ABOUT HER ON WET DAYS IN THE HALF-EMPTY ROOMS OF THE LARGE OLD HOUSE
THERE IT WAS BLACK UNDER THE DARKENING SKY
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING IN THE WOOD
IT WAS A SCENE TO SICKEN FOR WITH A SORT OF CALENTURE IN HOT AND DUSTY STREETS--SUCH COOLNESS SUCH PURITY SUCH FRESH FRAGRANCE OF NEW-PRESSED CHEESE OF FIRM BUTTER OF WOODEN VESSELS PERPETUALLY BATHED IN PURE WATER
MAKE HER DREAD TO KEEP THE ACCURSED THING WITHIN HER SOUL
NO SIR I COME FROM SNOWFIELD IN STONYSHIRE
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NOT PART WITH ANY OF OUR GUESTS TILL ELEVEN
THAT WAS MY WAY AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER
WELL ADAM HOW ARE YOU SAID ARTHUR HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
HE PREACHED OUT OF DOORS TO THEM AND HE MADE FRIENDS OF POOR WORKMEN AND TAUGHT THEM AND TOOK PAINS WITH THEM
I CANNOT SAY THAT THE INTERIOR OF HAYSLOPE CHURCH WAS REMARKABLE FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE GREY AGE OF ITS OAKEN PEWS--GREAT SQUARE PEWS MOSTLY RANGED ON EACH SIDE OF A NARROW AISLE
WE SHALL HAVE THAT FLYIN UP IN OUR FACES AND OUR CHILDREN'S AFTER US THAT WAS A LONG VISIT TO THE HALL FARM AND DREW TOO STRONGLY ON ADAM'S ENERGIES FOR HIM TO THINK OF SEEING OTHERS OR RE-ENTERING ON HIS OLD OCCUPATIONS TILL THE MORROW
DINAH DELIGHTED IN HER BEDROOM WINDOW
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE--AFTER I'VE MADE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS
WHEN SHE AWOKE IT WAS DEEP NIGHT AND SHE FELT CHILL
BUT MR POYSER DROVE AT NO MORE THAN A WALKING PACE THAT THERE MIGHT BE AS LITTLE RISK OF JOLTING AS POSSIBLE ON THIS WARM DAY AND THERE WAS TIME TO EXCHANGE GREETINGS AND REMARKS WITH THE FOOT-PASSENGERS WHO WERE GOING THE SAME WAY SPECKING THE PATHS BETWEEN THE GREEN MEADOWS AND THE GOLDEN CORNFIELDS WITH BITS OF MOVABLE BRIGHT COLOUR--A SCARLET WAISTCOAT TO MATCH THE POPPIES THAT NODDED A LITTLE TOO THICKLY AMONG THE CORN OR A DARK-BLUE NECKERCHIEF WITH ENDS FLAUNTING ACROSS A BRAND-NEW WHITE SMOCK-FROCK
WHAT CLUMSY UGLY PEOPLE BUT BLESS US THINGS MAY BE LOVABLE THAT ARE NOT ALTOGETHER HANDSOME I HOPE
AND HE'S GOT THE SAME WAY O THINKING AS DINAH
AND I'M SURE HE HAS A LOVING SPIRIT TOO
I COULDN'T KILL IT ANY OTHER WAY
THE SMALL WINDOW WHICH HAD HITHERTO FREELY LET IN THE FROSTY MOONLIGHT OR THE WARM SUMMER SUNRISE ON THE WORKING MAN'S SLUMBER MUST NOW BE DARKENED WITH A FAIR WHITE SHEET FOR THIS WAS THE SLEEP WHICH IS AS SACRED UNDER THE BARE RAFTERS AS IN CEILED HOUSES
WHEN IS YOUR FATHER TO BE BURIED ON SUNDAY SIR
CHAPTER VII THE DAIRY THE DAIRY WAS CERTAINLY WORTH LOOKING AT
BUT IN THE SAME INSTANT DINAH HAD LAID HER HAND ON LISBETH'S AGAIN AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED DOWN AT IT
THEY DID YOU GOOD WITHOUT BITING YOUR NOSE
IT'S THE SILLIEST LIE A SENSIBLE MAN LIKE YOU EVER BELIEVED TO SAY A WOMAN MAKES A HOUSE COMFORTABLE
AN I'D BETTER NIVER HA HAD A SON AS IS LIKE NO OTHER BODY'S SON FOR THE DEFTNESS AN TH HANDINESS AN SO LOOKED ON BY TH GRIT FOLKS AN TALL AN UPRIGHT LIKE A POPLAR-TREE AN ME TO BE PARTED FROM HIM AN NIVER SEE M NO MORE COME MOTHER DONNA GRIEVE THYSELF IN VAIN SAID SETH IN A SOOTHING VOICE
ALTHOUGH HER POOR SOUL IS VERY DARK AND DISCERNS LITTLE BEYOND THE THINGS OF THE FLESH SHE IS NO LONGER HARD
WHAT'S TH USE O TELLING ME THINGS AS I ONLY THINK TOO MUCH ON EVERY DAY
AN THERE'S THE PRETTY PREACHER WOMAN
TH YOUNG MEASTER'S A MERRY MON KESTER FREQUENTLY REMARKED
TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT HETTY SAID YES
WHAT A TIME THAT GELL IS DRAWING TH ALE TO BE SURE SAID MRS POYSER WHEN SHE WAS DISPENSING HER SLICES OF STUFFED CHINE
THEY ALWAYS TOLD ME I WAS GOOD-NATURED--AND THAT'S THE TRUTH AND TO MY HURT TOO ELSE THERE'S THEM IN THIS HOUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW TO LORD IT OVER ME IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM HETTY WALKED HASTILY ACROSS THE SHORT SPACE OF PLEASURE-GROUND WHICH SHE HAD TO TRAVERSE DREADING TO MEET MR CRAIG TO WHOM SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE SPOKEN CIVILLY
HIS ARM'S THICKER NOR A FRENCHMAN'S BODY I'LL BE BOUND FOR THEY PINCH THEIRSELLS IN WI STAYS
SHE HAS THOUGHT OF THIS POOL OFTEN IN THE NIGHTS OF THE MONTH THAT HAS JUST GONE BY AND NOW AT LAST SHE IS COME TO SEE IT
I HAVE FELT AS IT WERE A DIVISION IN MY HEART
TO THINK EVERYTHING SHE SAID AND DID WAS JUST RIGHT AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER
SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED
HE ISNA GONE TO TREDDLES'ON
THE FATHER TO WHOM WE OWE OUR BEST HERITAGE--THE MECHANICAL INSTINCT THE KEEN SENSIBILITY TO HARMONY THE UNCONSCIOUS SKILL OF THE MODELLING HAND--GALLS US AND PUTS US TO SHAME BY HIS DAILY ERRORS
I MAY'S WELL DIE AN FOLLER MY OLD MAN
WHY DINAH MORRIS LOOKS VERY NICE FOR ALL SHE WEARS SUCH A PLAIN CAP AND GOWN
NO I'VE NO ROOM FOR SUCH FEELINGS AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE PEOPLE EVER TAKE NOTICE ABOUT THAT
THESE WERE THE INCONGRUOUS THOUGHTS IN HIS MIND AS HE LED MRS POYSER WHO WAS PANTING WITH FATIGUE AND SECRETLY RESOLVING THAT NEITHER JUDGE NOR JURY SHOULD FORCE HER TO DANCE ANOTHER DANCE TO TAKE A QUIET REST IN THE DINING-ROOM WHERE SUPPER WAS LAID OUT FOR THE GUESTS TO COME AND TAKE IT AS THEY CHOSE
I SEE NO CLEAR ROAD TO A PARTNERSHIP
AND SO I COME BACK TO MR IRWINE WITH WHOM I DESIRE YOU TO BE IN PERFECT CHARITY FAR AS HE MAY BE FROM SATISFYING YOUR DEMANDS ON THE CLERICAL CHARACTER
MY GRANDFATHER WILL NEVER LET ME HAVE ANY POWER WHILE HE LIVES BUT THERE'S NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER THAN TO UNDERTAKE THE STONYSHIRE SIDE OF THE ESTATE--IT'S IN A DISMAL CONDITION--AND SET IMPROVEMENTS ON FOOT AND GALLOP ABOUT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER AND OVERLOOK THEM
WELL MRS BEDE SAID MRS POYSER AS THEY WALKED ON TOGETHER YOU MUST KEEP UP YOUR HEART
I AM CONVINCED--I AM SURE HE DIDN'T FALL UNDER TEMPTATION WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
AND NOW AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE STARTING NANCY THE DAIRY-MAID WAS CLOSING THE SHUTTERS OF THE HOUSE-PLACE ALTHOUGH THE WINDOW LYING UNDER THE IMMEDIATE OBSERVATION OF ALICK AND THE DOGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE SELECTED FOR A BURGLARIOUS ATTEMPT
NOT TO THANK THE CAPTAIN FOR WHAT HE'S GIVEN YOU I'M SURE SIR IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU
BUT WE MUST NOT GO NOW
IT WAS GOING TO BE A BRIGHT WARM DAY AND HE WOULD START TO WORK AGAIN WHEN HE HAD HAD HIS BREAKFAST
THE PLEASURE OF THE DANCE WITH HETTY WAS GONE
AND NOW IT WAS ACTUALLY IN HIS POWER TO DO A GREAT DEAL FOR THEM
ANY AFFECTION OR COMFORT DINAH COULD HAVE GIVEN HER WOULD HAVE BEEN AS INDIFFERENT TO HETTY THIS MORNING AS EVERYTHING ELSE WAS EXCEPT HER BRUISED PASSION
SHE FELT THIS COUNTER-EXCITEMENT TO HER SORROW STILL MORE STRONGLY AS SHE WALKED WITH HER SONS TOWARDS THE CHURCH DOOR AND SAW THE FRIENDLY SYMPATHETIC NODS OF THEIR FELLOW-PARISHIONERS
WE GO ASTRAY AND DO WRONG AND BRING OURSELVES INTO TROUBLE WITH OUR FELLOW-MEN
YOU MAY'S WELL PELT A BAG O FEATHERS AS TALK TO EM
THE NEXT WORDS WERE HARD TO SPEAK
THE BOY'S FLUTELIKE VOICE HAS ITS OWN SPRING CHARM
AND BESIDES SHE KNEW THE FUNERAL PSALM WAS GOING TO BE SUNG FOR HIM
ADAM'S FAR BEFORE ME AN'S DONE MORE FOR ME THAN I CAN EVER DO FOR HIM
YOU'RE ALL FARMERS AREN'T YOU
AND OCCASIONAL DAYS OF SUNSHINE AND DRYING WINDS FLATTERED THIS HOPE
FOR THIS NEW PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOLLOWING SO QUICKLY ON THE SHOCK OF PAIN HAD AN INTOXICATING EFFECT ON THE SOBER ADAM WHO HAD ALL HIS LIFE BEEN USED TO MUCH HARDSHIP AND MODERATE HOPE
DOESN'T THE LOVE MAKE IT RIGHT WHEN NOTHING ELSE WOULD ADAM MY MIND IS FULL OF QUESTIONINGS ABOUT THAT
HE WAS HAPPY AND WOULD MAKE EVERY ONE ELSE HAPPY THAT CAME WITHIN HIS REACH
YOU WILL BE THE LESS SURPRISED AT THIS OPINION IN SO GRAVE A PERSONAGE WHEN YOU LEARN THAT BEN HAD REQUESTED MR RANN TO ACCOMPANY HIM ON THE FIDDLE AND JOSHUA FELT QUITE SURE THAT THOUGH THERE MIGHT NOT BE MUCH IN THE DANCING THE MUSIC WOULD MAKE UP FOR IT
WONDERING IF IT WERE VERY PAINFUL TO BE DROWNED AND IF THERE WOULD BE ANYTHING WORSE AFTER DEATH THAN WHAT SHE DREADED IN LIFE
AND IT WAS HER SHROUD ONLY THREE MONTHS AFTER
ARTHUR LOOSED ADAM'S ARM AND THREW HIMSELF ON THE OTTOMAN
BUT IF YOU WANT THE THINGS AGAIN YOU'LL WRITE BEFORE LONG SAID THE LANDLADY BECAUSE WHEN TWO MONTHS ARE UP WE SHALL MAKE UP OUR MINDS AS YOU DON'T WANT EM YES SAID HETTY INDIFFERENTLY
AND MR WESLEY APPROVED OF HER UNDERTAKING THE WORK
BUT ON LEARNING THAT SAD FACT HE TOOK HIS FAVOURITE PENCIL-CASE AND A SILVER-HAFTED KNIFE OUT OF HIS POCKET AND OFFERED THEM AS COMPENSATION
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER ROSE-COLOURED RIBBONS
DOST THINK SHE'S QUITE FIXED AGAINST MARRYING SETH
THE OLD TOP-KNOTTED HENS SCRATCHING WITH THEIR CHICKS AMONG THE STRAW SET UP A SYMPATHETIC CROAKING AS THE DISCOMFITED COCK JOINS THEM
HOW'S SHE TO GET A LIKIN FOR HIM I'D LIKE TO KNOW
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE DISPLEASED WITH ME IF THINGS TURNED OUT SO AS I COULD LEAVE THIS COUNTRY AND GO TO LIVE AT SNOWFIELD NO SETH
DO YOU REMEMBER AYE SIR I REMEMBER
SHE WENT INTO THE BREWHOUSE TO NANCY I THINK THE PROUD MOTHER UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO SHOW HER TOTTY PASSED AT ONCE INTO THE BACK KITCHEN IN SEARCH OF HER NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT MISGIVINGS LEST SOMETHING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO RENDER HER PERSON AND ATTIRE UNFIT FOR PRESENTATION
THEY WONNA HAVE LONG TO WAIT FOR ONE ANOTHER THEN ANYHOW
AND GOD HELPS US WITH OUR HEADPIECES AND OUR HANDS AS WELL AS WITH OUR SOULS
IT'S TIME THEE WAST IN BED
HETTY WAS LED OUT BY THE INEVITABLE MR CRAIG AND MARY BURGE BY ADAM
PERHAPS I FEEL MORE FOR YOU THAN I OUGHT TO FEEL FOR ANY CREATURE FOR I OFTEN CAN'T HELP SAYING OF YOU WHAT THE HYMN SAYS IN DARKEST SHADES IF SHE APPEAR MY DAWNING IS BEGUN
TEARS CAME--SHE HAD NEVER SHED TEARS BEFORE SINCE SHE LEFT WINDSOR--TEARS AND SOBS OF HYSTERICAL JOY THAT SHE HAD STILL HOLD OF LIFE THAT SHE WAS STILL ON THE FAMILIAR EARTH WITH THE SHEEP NEAR HER
THERE'S FOLKS AS MAKE BAD BUTTER AND TRUSTEN TO THE SALT T HIDE IT MRS POYSER'S ATTENTION WAS HERE DIVERTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MOLLY CARRYING A LARGE JUG TWO SMALL MUGS AND FOUR DRINKING-CANS ALL FULL OF ALE OR SMALL BEER--AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF THE PREHENSILE POWER POSSESSED BY THE HUMAN HAND
IT WAS OF NO USE NOW--HIS RESOLUTION NOT TO SPEAK TILL TO-MORROW
BY THE TIME IT GOT SHALLOW AS SHE REMEMBERED THE POOLS DID AT HAYSLOPE IN THE SUMMER NO ONE COULD FIND OUT THAT IT WAS HER BODY
SHE HAD MADE A LONG PAUSE BEFORE THE EXCLAMATION AND THE PAUSE SEEMED TO BE FILLED BY AGITATING THOUGHTS THAT SHOWED THEMSELVES IN HER FEATURES
HOW THE MEN ENVY HIM WHO COME TO THE WEDDING BREAKFAST AND SEE HER HANGING ON HIS ARM IN HER WHITE LACE AND ORANGE BLOSSOMS
GET SOME WATER TOO ADAM WAS RELIEVED TO HAVE AN ACTIVE TASK--BOTH OF THEM WERE RELIEVED TO BE APART FROM EACH OTHER FOR A SHORT TIME
BODILY HASTE AND EXERTION USUALLY LEAVE OUR THOUGHTS VERY MUCH AT THE MERCY OF OUR FEELINGS AND IMAGINATION
HERE'S TOTTY
BUT IF SHE'S BETTER THAN THEY ARE IN OTHER THINGS I CANNA THINK SHE'LL FALL SHORT OF EM IN LOVING NO MORE WAS SAID
AND THERE'S YOUR MONTH'S WAGE GONE AND MORE TO PAY FOR THAT JUG AS I'VE HAD I THE HOUSE THIS TEN YEAR AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED TO'T BEFORE
SHE DETERMINED TO TAKE THE COACH FOR THE REST OF THE WAY THOUGH IT SHOULD COST HER ALL HER REMAINING MONEY
THE FACE WAS MARBLE NOW
HE HAD ALSO HIGH SHOULDERS AND HIGH CHEEK-BONES AND HUNG HIS HEAD FORWARD A LITTLE AS HE WALKED ALONG WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS BREECHES POCKETS
I'M ILL HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND REACHED HIS CAP AS IF INTENDING TO GO
AND MY MIND IS AT REST FOR I AM NOT SEEKING MY OWN WILL IN GOING BUT IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT DINAH SAID ADAM HESITATINGLY
HE KNEW THE BACKS OF ALL THE BOOKS ON THE SHELF RUNNING ALONG THE WHITEWASHED WALL ABOVE THE PEGS FOR THE SLATES
BUT YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER SORT O FACE
IT IS OFFERED TO YOU
DECENT BURIAL WAS WHAT LISBETH HAD BEEN THINKING OF FOR HERSELF THROUGH YEARS OF THRIFT WITH AN INDISTINCT EXPECTATION THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW WHEN SHE WAS BEING CARRIED TO THE CHURCHYARD FOLLOWED BY HER HUSBAND AND HER SONS
BUT HETTY'S TEARS WERE NOT FOR ADAM--NOT FOR THE ANGUISH THAT WOULD COME UPON HIM WHEN HE FOUND SHE WAS GONE FROM HIM FOR EVER
I'VE GOT NO WIFE TO WORM IT OUT OF ME AND THEN RUN OUT AND CACKLE IT IN EVERYBODY'S HEARING
IT'S VERY BLESSED ON A BLEAK COLD DAY WHEN THE SKY IS HANGING DARK OVER THE HILL TO FEEL THE LOVE OF GOD IN ONE'S SOUL AND CARRY IT TO THE LONELY BARE STONE HOUSES WHERE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO GIVE COMFORT EH SAID LISBETH THAT'S VERY WELL FOR YE TO TALK AS LOOKS WELLY LIKE THE SNOWDROP-FLOWERS AS HA LIVED FOR DAYS AN DAYS WHEN I'N GETHERED EM WI NOTHIN BUT A DROP O WATER AN A PEEP O DAYLIGHT
SHE MIGHT HAVE LOVED SETH AND CONSENTED TO MARRY HIM
WE'RE LIKE ENOUGH TO FIND LIFE A TOUGH JOB--HARD WORK INSIDE AND OUT
HE STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND STOOD FOR A SINGLE MINUTE WITH A SENSE OF VIOLENT CONVULSION IN HIS WHOLE FRAME AS IF THE LIFE WERE GOING OUT OF HIM WITH HORRIBLE THROBS
AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE MUCH MORE DECIDED ADVANCES IF HER UNCLE POYSER THINKING BUT LIGHTLY OF A YOUNG MAN WHOSE FATHER'S LAND WAS SO FOUL AS OLD LUKE BRITTON'S HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HER AUNT TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ANY CIVILITIES
WHEN SHE HAD THOUGHT OF THIS SHE FASTENED UP HER HAIR AND BEGAN TO WASH
THEY KNEW NOW QUITE WELL IN WHAT SORT OF ROOMS THE KING AND QUEEN LIVED AND THEIR THOUGHTS GLANCED WITH SOME PITY TOWARDS COUSINS AND ACQUAINTANCES WHO HAD NOT THIS FINE OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING HOW THINGS WENT ON IN THE GREAT WORLD
WHY NELSON AND THE REST OF EM UD HAVE NO MERIT I BEATING EM IF THEY WERE SUCH OFFAL AS FOLKS PRETEND MR POYSER LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT MR CRAIG PUZZLED BY THIS OPPOSITION OF AUTHORITIES
I SHALL SOON HA DONE NOW I'LL HELP YOU SAID ADAM
TO BE SHUT UP AT THE CHASE WITH A BROKEN ARM WHEN EVERY OTHER FELLOW IN HIS REGIMENT WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF AT WINDSOR--SHUT UP WITH HIS GRANDFATHER WHO HAD THE SAME SORT OF AFFECTION FOR HIM AS FOR HIS PARCHMENT DEEDS
THEE'DST LIKE TO HA A WIFE TO MEND THY CLOTHES AN GET THY VICTUAL BETTER NOR THY OLD MOTHER
HE WAS OF SO EXCELLENT A DISPOSITION THAT HE HAD BEEN KINDER AND MORE RESPECTFUL THAN EVER TO HIS OLD FATHER SINCE HE HAD MADE A DEED OF GIFT OF ALL HIS PROPERTY AND NO MAN JUDGED HIS NEIGHBOURS MORE CHARITABLY ON ALL PERSONAL MATTERS
WHEN TITYRUS AND MELIBOEUS HAPPEN TO BE ON THE SAME FARM THEY ARE NOT SENTIMENTALLY POLITE TO EACH OTHER
HE KNEW QUITE WELL WHAT WAS IN HER MIND
AN YOU'LL HAPPEN HA DOUBLE RATES TO PAY HE ADDED LOOKING UP AT HIS SON
THE MERE ACT OF TELLING IT WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL
FOR WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE SHOULD DO WITH HER LIFE SHE CRAVED THE MEANS OF LIVING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
I SHALL BE YOUR TRUE FRIEND AS LONG AS LIFE LASTS AND I HOPE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU IN MANY WAYS
THAT ARTHUR EXISTED NO LONGER
I SAW SHE WAS A METHODIST OR QUAKER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BY HER DRESS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A PREACHER IT'S A TRUE WORD AS I SAY SIR REJOINED MR RANN COMPRESSING HIS MOUTH INTO A SEMICIRCULAR FORM AND PAUSING LONG ENOUGH TO INDICATE THREE NOTES OF EXCLAMATION
I'LL GO INTO THE GARDEN NOW AND SEND IN THE LITTLE LASS AYE DO
SHE HAD SPENT NO MONEY EXCEPT WHAT SHE HAD PAID FOR HER FOOD BUT SHE FELT THAT THIS SLOW JOURNEYING WOULD BE INTOLERABLE FOR HER ANOTHER DAY AND IN THE MORNING SHE FOUND HER WAY TO A COACH-OFFICE TO ASK ABOUT THE ROAD TO WINDSOR AND SEE IF IT WOULD COST HER TOO MUCH TO GO PART OF THE DISTANCE BY COACH AGAIN
YOU MAY TELL ME THAT YOU MEDITATE NO FATAL ACT OF VENGEANCE BUT THE FEELING IN YOUR MIND IS WHAT GIVES BIRTH TO SUCH ACTIONS AND AS LONG AS YOU INDULGE IT AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG
ONLY SHE SHOULD NOT BE OLD AND UGLY LIKE MISS LYDIA OR ALL THE SAME THICKNESS LIKE LADY DACEY BUT VERY PRETTY WITH HER HAIR DONE IN A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND SOMETIMES IN A PINK DRESS AND SOMETIMES IN A WHITE ONE--SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH SHE LIKED BEST
YET WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER SHE WAS STANDING WITH HER BACK TOWARDS HIM AND STOOPING TO GATHER THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT
ALL SCREENING SELF-EXCUSE WHICH RARELY FALLS QUITE AWAY WHILE OTHERS RESPECT US FORSOOK HIM FOR AN INSTANT AND HE STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE FIRST GREAT IRREVOCABLE EVIL HE HAD EVER COMMITTED
THE SOOTHED SENSATION THAT CAME OVER HER FROM THE SATISFACTION OF HER HUNGER AND THIS FIXED DREAMY ATTITUDE BROUGHT ON DROWSINESS AND PRESENTLY HER HEAD SANK DOWN ON HER KNEES
BUT I MAY AS WELL LOOK AT THE PAMPHLETS
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HETTY STARTED UP AGAIN FEELING THAT DARKNESS WOULD SOON COME ON
AND WHEN I TOOK IT HOME MISS LYDDY SENT FOR ME TO BRING IT INTO HER DRAWING-ROOM SO AS SHE MIGHT GIVE ME DIRECTIONS ABOUT FASTENING ON THE WORK--VERY FINE NEEDLEWORK JACOB AND RACHEL A-KISSING ONE ANOTHER AMONG THE SHEEP LIKE A PICTURE--AND TH OLD SQUIRE WAS SITTING THERE FOR HE MOSTLY SITS WITH HER
HE TOLD ME HIMSELF HE MEANT NOTHING BY HIS KISSING AND PRESENTS AND HE WANTED TO MAKE ME BELIEVE AS YOU THOUGHT LIGHT OF EM TOO
SHE THINKS A DEAL ABOUT HER ADAM MADE NO REPLY TO THAT AND NO OTHER WORD BUT GOOD-NIGHT PASSED BETWEEN THEM
LISBETH BEDE LOVES HER SON WITH THE LOVE OF A WOMAN TO WHOM HER FIRST-BORN HAS COME LATE IN LIFE
HE IS AMONG US
THE QUIET DEPTH OF CONVICTION WITH WHICH SHE SPOKE SEEMED IN ITSELF AN EVIDENCE FOR THE TRUTH OF HER MESSAGE
LET US GO AND MEET HIM
HEAR IT
WE'VE ALL HAD OUR TURN AT BEIN YOUNG I RECKON BE'T GOOD LUCK OR ILL BUT SHE MUST LEARN TO COMMODATE HERSELF TO YOUNG WOMEN SAID MR POYSER FOR IT ISN'T TO BE COUNTED ON AS ADAM AND SETH ULL KEEP BACHELORS FOR THE NEXT TEN YEAR TO PLEASE THEIR MOTHER
BUT ON ONE OF THESE LEAVES THERE WAS A NAME WHICH OFTEN AS SHE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE NOW FLASHED ON HETTY'S MIND LIKE A NEWLY DISCOVERED MESSAGE
AN I THINK AS HE SHOULD BE LET KNOW AS HE ISNA T HAVE THE MAKIN AN MENDIN O CHURCH CARTS AN IMPLEMEN'S LET ALONE STAYIN I THAT HOUSE AN YARD AS IS SQUIRE DONNITHORNE'S WELL BUT YOU SAY YOURSELF JOSHUA THAT YOU NEVER KNEW ANY ONE COME TO PREACH ON THE GREEN BEFORE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK HOW HE COULD MEET HER
HUNTING AND SHOOTING AND ADORNING THEIR OWN HOUSES
HE KNEW THAT TREE WELL
THE BLUE VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE CORDS UNDER THE TRANSPARENT YELLOW SKIN AND THIS INTIMIDATING BROW WAS SOFTENED BY NO TENDENCY TO BALDNESS FOR THE GREY BRISTLY HAIR CUT DOWN TO ABOUT AN INCH IN LENGTH STOOD ROUND IT IN AS CLOSE RANKS AS EVER
EVERYBODY UD BE WANTING BREAD MADE O TAIL ENDS AND EVERYBODY UD BE RUNNING AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE TO PREACH TO EM ISTEAD O BRINGING UP THEIR FAMILIES AND LAYING BY AGAINST A BAD HARVEST
JESUS
CHAPTER XXIV THE HEALTH-DRINKING WHEN THE DINNER WAS OVER AND THE FIRST DRAUGHTS FROM THE GREAT CASK OF BIRTHDAY ALE WERE BROUGHT UP ROOM WAS MADE FOR THE BROAD MR POYSER AT THE SIDE OF THE TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS WERE PLACED AT THE HEAD
BUT IN IMAGINING THE MEETING HE HAD ALWAYS SEEN ARTHUR AS HE HAD MET HIM ON THAT EVENING IN THE GROVE FLORID CARELESS LIGHT OF SPEECH
IT WAS VERY MUCH IN THIS WAY THAT OUR FRIEND ADAM BEDE THOUGHT ABOUT HETTY
IT WAS AN OLD OLD SCARF FULL OF RENTS BUT IT WOULD MAKE A BECOMING BORDER ROUND HER SHOULDERS AND SET OFF THE WHITENESS OF HER UPPER ARM
AND HE PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT THAT COURSE WAS TO MAKE THE WAY OPEN BETWEEN ADAM AND HETTY
IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO BELIEVE THAT THE LOCKET WAS GIVEN TO HER BY A LOVER
SHE WONDERED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HER AND ARTHUR
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE SHE SHOULD HEAR ANYTHING BUT SELF-RENOUNCING AFFECTION AND RESPECT IN HIS ASSURANCE THAT HE WAS CONTENTED FOR HER TO GO AWAY
BUT T HEAR SOME O THEM PREACHERS YOU'D THINK AS A MAN MUST BE DOING NOTHING ALL'S LIFE BUT SHUTTING'S EYES AND LOOKING WHAT'S AGOING ON INSIDE HIM
THAT CHILD GETS PRETTIER AND PRETTIER EVERY DAY I DO BELIEVE WAS HER INWARD COMMENT
AND THEY WERE ACCOMMODATING HETTY POOR THING--A PRETTY RESPECTABLE-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN APPARENTLY IN A SAD CASE
NAY NAY I'LL NEVER SLIP MY NECK OUT O THE YOKE AND LEAVE THE LOAD TO BE DRAWN BY THE WEAK UNS
YOUR PASSION MIGHT LEAD YOU YOURSELF INTO A HORRIBLE CRIME NO--NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY
YOU HAD THE BEST OF IT AND THAT WAS AS IT SHOULD BE FOR I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN MOST IN THE WRONG OF THE TWO
I'LL KEEP IN THE ROAD IF YOU'LL BE SO GOOD AS SHOW ME HOW TO GET TO IT WHY DOOANT YOU KEEP WHERE THERE'S A FINGER-POASSES AN FOLKS TO AX THE WAY ON THE MAN SAID STILL MORE GRUFFLY
BUT THE GENEROUS STIRRING OF NEIGHBOURLY KINDNESS THAT PROMPTED THE DEED HAS A BENEFICENT RADIATION THAT IS NOT LOST
AND AT LAST BY THE ROADSIDE THERE WAS A BARN--EVER SUCH A WAY OFF ANY HOUSE--LIKE THE BARN IN ABBOT'S CLOSE AND I THOUGHT I COULD GO IN THERE AND HIDE MYSELF AMONG THE HAY AND STRAW AND NOBODY UD BE LIKELY TO COME
YOU CAN NEITHER STRAIGHTEN THEIR NOSES NOR BRIGHTEN THEIR WIT NOR RECTIFY THEIR DISPOSITIONS
I SEE HIM SETH DINAH SAID AS SHE LOOKED INTO THE HOUSE
IT WAS QUITE A PITY HANDSOME CLEVER MRS IRWINE SHOULD HAVE HAD SUCH COMMONPLACE DAUGHTERS
IF WE STAY IT'S FOR OUR OWN WORLDLY INTEREST AND IT LOOKS AS IF WE'D PUT UP WITH ANYTHING FOR THE SAKE O THAT
LET ME PRAY A BIT WITH THEE FOR FATHER AND ADAM AND ALL OF US--IT'LL COMFORT THEE HAPPEN MORE THAN THEE THINKST WELL I'VE NOTHIN TO SAY AGAIN IT LISBETH THOUGH DISPOSED ALWAYS TO TAKE THE NEGATIVE SIDE IN HER CONVERSATIONS WITH SETH HAD A VAGUE SENSE THAT THERE WAS SOME COMFORT AND SAFETY IN THE FACT OF HIS PIETY AND THAT IT SOMEHOW RELIEVED HER FROM THE TROUBLE OF ANY SPIRITUAL TRANSACTIONS ON HER OWN BEHALF
THE PULPIT AND DESK GREY AND OLD AS THE PEWS STOOD ON ONE SIDE OF THE ARCH LEADING INTO THE CHANCEL WHICH ALSO HAD ITS GREY SQUARE PEWS FOR MR DONNITHORNE'S FAMILY AND SERVANTS
THAT IS PERHAPS A PAINFUL FACT BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE CANNOT REFORM OUR FOREFATHERS DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUATRAIN SUNG DECIDEDLY FORTE NO CAN WAS FILLED
HE WOULD BEHAVE IN A QUIET KIND WAY TO HER--JUST TO PREVENT HER FROM GOING HOME WITH HER HEAD FULL OF WRONG FANCIES
I CAN KEEP MY OWN COUNSEL WHEN THERE'S NO GOOD I SPEAKING BUT DINAH LL HA NONE O HIM
FOR IF EVERYBODY TRIED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSE AND HOME AND WITH POOR EATING AND DRINKING AND WAS ALLAYS TALKING AS WE MUST DESPISE THE THINGS O THE WORLD AS YOU SAY I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THE PICK O THE STOCK AND THE CORN AND THE BEST NEW-MILK CHEESES UD HAVE TO GO
ADAM REACHED IT IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER LEAVING THE HALL FARM
IT WAS A RELIEF TO HER THAT HE BEHAVED SO KINDLY TO HER TO-DAY AND WANTED TO SPEAK TO HER ALONE FOR SHE HAD TREMBLED WHEN SHE FOUND HE WAS GOING HOME WITH THEM LEST HE SHOULD MEAN TO TELL BUT NOW HE WANTED TO TALK TO HER BY HERSELF SHE SHOULD LEARN WHAT HE THOUGHT AND WHAT HE MEANT TO DO
HIS OWN AGITATION WAS QUELLED BY A CERTAIN AWE THAT COMES OVER US IN THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT ANGUISH FOR THE ANGUISH HE MUST INFLICT ON ADAM WAS ALREADY PRESENT TO HIM
AT STONITON ANOTHER DELAY OCCURRED FOR THE OLD COACHMAN WHO HAD DRIVEN HETTY WOULD NOT BE IN THE TOWN AGAIN TILL NIGHT
HE ROSE AND FOLLOWED HER AND DARTED AN EAGER GLANCE INTO THE LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS NARROW BED THE PORTRAIT OF WESLEY ON THE WALL AND THE FEW BOOKS LYING ON THE LARGE BIBLE
BUT HE MUST GO AT LAST AND ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO PRESS HER HAND GENTLY AS HE SAID GOOD-BYE AND HOPE SHE WOULD TAKE THAT AS A SIGN THAT IF HIS LOVE COULD EVER BE A REFUGE FOR HER IT WAS THERE THE SAME AS EVER
HIS LAST WAKING THOUGHTS MELTED INTO A DREAM THAT HE WAS WITH HETTY AGAIN AT THE HALL FARM AND THAT HE WAS ASKING HER TO FORGIVE HIM FOR BEING SO COLD AND SILENT
YOU MAY TALK O THESE THINGS FOR HOURS ON END AND YOU'LL ONLY BE ALL THE MORE COXY AND CONCEITED FOR'T
LOOK AT ADAM THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY AS HE STANDS ON THE SCAFFOLDING WITH THE TWO-FEET RULER IN HIS HAND WHISTLING LOW WHILE HE CONSIDERS HOW A DIFFICULTY ABOUT A FLOOR-JOIST OR A WINDOW-FRAME IS TO BE OVERCOME
HETTY BENDING OVER THE RED BUNCHES THE LEVEL RAYS PIERCING THE SCREEN OF APPLE-TREE BOUGHS THE LENGTH OF BUSHY GARDEN BEYOND HIS OWN EMOTION AS HE LOOKED AT HER AND BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THEM TO TALK--ADAM REMEMBERED IT ALL TO THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE
THAT WAS THE FOREGROUND OF HETTY'S PICTURE
YOU DRIVE ME PAST BEARING
IT'S A GREY COB SIR AN HE SETS GREAT STORE BY'T
IT WOULD BE THE SAME WITH YOU ADAM AND IT COULD BE NOTHING BUT A DESIRE TO GIVE ME WORSE PAIN THAT COULD INCLINE YOU TO GO ARTHUR WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID WITH SOME AGITATION IN HIS VOICE I WOULDN'T ACT SO TOWARDS YOU I KNOW
IT'S BUT LITTLE GOOD YOU'LL DO A-WATERING THE LAST YEAR'S CROP WELL ADAM SAID MR POYSER FEELING THAT HIS WIFE'S WORDS WERE AS USUAL RATHER INCISIVE THAN SOOTHING AND THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT YOU'LL COME AND SEE US AGAIN NOW I HOPE
FAREWELL DINAH PRESSED HIS HAND WITH RATHER A SAD LOOK IN HER LOVING EYES AND THEN PASSED THROUGH THE GATE WHILE SETH TURNED AWAY TO WALK LINGERINGLY HOME
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE MORE POWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW AND COULD TURN THE BUSINESS TO BETTER ACCOUNT PERHAPS
DOST THINK THEE'ST FINISHED THE DOOR AYE SURE SAID SETH WITH ANSWERING SURPRISE
HER CHEEKS NEVER GREW A SHADE DEEPER WHEN HIS NAME WAS MENTIONED
DOES HE KNOW OF YOU'RE GOING DINAH YES I TOLD HIM LAST SABBATH ADAM REMEMBERED NOW THAT SETH HAD COME HOME MUCH DEPRESSED ON SUNDAY EVENING A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN VERY UNUSUAL WITH HIM OF LATE FOR THE HAPPINESS HE HAD IN SEEING DINAH EVERY WEEK SEEMED LONG TO HAVE OUTWEIGHED THE PAIN OF KNOWING SHE WOULD NEVER MARRY HIM
THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME WHEN WE'D GOT HOLD O ONE ANOTHER'S HANDS WAS I COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING FOR HER ADAM--SHE LIVED LONG ENOUGH FOR ALL THE SUFFERING--AND I'D THOUGHT SO OF THE TIME WHEN I MIGHT DO SOMETHING FOR HER
THE POYSERS CANNA WANT THEE SO BAD AS I DO
AND SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AS IF I MUST GO BACK TO THE FARM SOONER THAN THAT
I HOPE THEY'RE AS WELL AS USUAL YES THANK YOU MRS POYSER EXCEPT THAT MISS ANNE HAS ONE OF HER BAD HEADACHES TO-DAY
FOR WHEN ANYBODY'S WELL OFF THEY DON'T MUCH MIND ABOUT HEARING NEWS FROM DISTANT PARTS
CONSIDERING THESE THINGS WE CAN HARDLY THINK DINAH AND SETH BENEATH OUR SYMPATHY ACCUSTOMED AS WE MAY BE TO WEEP OVER THE LOFTIER SORROWS OF HEROINES IN SATIN BOOTS AND CRINOLINE AND OF HEROES RIDING FIERY HORSES THEMSELVES RIDDEN BY STILL MORE FIERY PASSIONS
YOU'RE GETTING TIRED
IT WAS POOR LISBETH'S BLIND WAY OF FEELING THAT HUMAN LOVE AND PITY ARE A GROUND OF FAITH IN SOME OTHER LOVE
NOW IN HER FAINTNESS OF HEART AT THE LENGTH AND DIFFICULTY OF HER JOURNEY SHE WAS MOST OF ALL AFRAID OF SPENDING HER MONEY AND BECOMING SO DESTITUTE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE'S CHARITY
BUT HE HAD AN AGREEABLE CONFIDENCE THAT HIS FAULTS WERE ALL OF A GENEROUS KIND--IMPETUOUS WARM-BLOODED LEONINE
LITTLE TROT A TINY SPANIEL HER INSEPARABLE COMPANION IN THE STABLE WAS COMFORTABLY CURLED UP ON HER BACK
YOU WOULD HARDLY HAVE KNOWN IT WAS ADAM WITHOUT BEING TOLD
IF A NEW BUILDING HAD FALLEN DOWN AND HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THIS WAS A DIVINE JUDGMENT HE WOULD HAVE SAID MAY BE
THE TRUTH IS THE BEST THING TO TELL
SHE FELT A CERTAIN CONFIDENCE THAT SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM NOT TO DO ANYTHING SHE DID NOT WANT HIM TO DO
BY THE TIME DINAH HAD UNDRESSED AND PUT ON HER NIGHT-GOWN THIS FEELING ABOUT HETTY HAD GATHERED A PAINFUL INTENSITY
IT WAS A PROOF SHE CARED ABOUT WHAT HE LIKED AND DISLIKED
DURING THAT LONG LONG JOURNEY IN THE TAXED CART THERE WAS TIME FOR ALL THE CONJECTURES OF IMPORTUNATE FEAR AND STRUGGLING HOPE
I SEEMED TO HATE IT--IT WAS LIKE A HEAVY WEIGHT HANGING ROUND MY NECK
THE LINES WERE ALL MORE GENEROUS THE SMILE BRIGHTER THE EXPRESSION HEARTIER
THE MAN WHO AWAKES THE WONDERING TREMULOUS PASSION OF A YOUNG GIRL ALWAYS THINKS HER AFFECTIONATE
ADAM WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE OUT OF HER REACH
BUT I FEEL BOUND TO STAND UP FOR YOU AS MY PUPIL YOU KNOW AND I MAINTAIN THAT YOU'RE NOT OF THAT WATERY QUALITY
AN AS FOR HIS DESARVING HER--SHE'S TWO EAR OLDER NOR SETH
NO MOTHER AND MR IRWINE REPLYING TO HER LAST WORDS
SHE WAS A MYSTERY TO HETTY BUT HETTY KNEW SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND
HE HAD HARDLY RETURNED FROM THE MARQUEE WITH THE PRIZE IN HIS HAND WHEN IT BEGAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT WIRY BEN PROPOSED TO AMUSE THE COMPANY BEFORE THE GENTRY WENT TO DINNER WITH AN IMPROMPTU AND GRATUITOUS PERFORMANCE--NAMELY A HORNPIPE THE MAIN IDEA OF WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS BORROWED
BUT IT ISNA RELIGION AS WAS I FAULT THERE
THAT EARLY AUTUMN SUNSHINE WHICH WE SHOULD KNOW WAS NOT SUMMER'S EVEN IF THERE WERE NOT THE TOUCHES OF YELLOW ON THE LIME AND CHESTNUT
WELL YE MAY DO AS YE LIKE WI ME
IT LOOKED TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT--IT LOOKED LIKE THE THINGS ON WHITE SATIN IN THE GREAT JEWELLER'S SHOP AT ROSSETER
HE WALKED RIGHT ON INTO THE CHASE GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE GROVE WHICH SURELY WAS HAUNTED BY HIS EVIL GENIUS
AND HIS AUNT LYDIA HERSELF HAD THE BENEFIT OF THAT SOFT-HEARTEDNESS WHICH HE BORE TOWARDS THE WHOLE SEX
SO SHE'LL BE FORCED TO DANCE THOUGH SHE'S LAID BY EVER SIN THE CHRISTMAS AFORE THE LITTLE UN WAS BORN
I CAN'T HELP BEING SORRY FOR THE DOGS ALWAYS THOUGH PERHAPS THERE'S NO NEED
HOW WAS ADAM TO KNOW THE TRUTH
I HAVEN'T GIVEN NOTICE TO MR BURGE ABOUT LEAVING HIM AND I DON'T LIKE TO TELL ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT BEFORE HE KNOWS FOR HE'LL BE A GOOD BIT HURT I DOUBT
ADAM OVERCOME WITH THE AGITATIONS AND EXERTIONS OF THE DAY AFTER HIS NIGHT OF HARD WORK HAD FALLEN ASLEEP ON A BENCH IN THE WORKSHOP
SHE SET DOWN THE CANDLE AND TOOK OUT THE LETTER
AND WHILE HE WAS DREAMING THIS ARTHUR WAS LEADING HETTY TO THE DANCE AND SAYING TO HER IN LOW HURRIED TONES I SHALL BE IN THE WOOD THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW AT SEVEN
THE TALK WAS IN RATHER A LOWER TONE THAN USUAL TO-DAY HUSHED A LITTLE BY THE SOUND OF MR IRWINE'S VOICE READING THE FINAL PRAYERS OF THE BURIAL-SERVICE
I FEEL CALLED TO LEAVE MY KINDRED FOR A WHILE
AN HE SAID AS OUR CHRISTMAS SINGIN WAS NO BETTER NOR THE CRACKLIN O THORNS UNDER A POT WELL HE'S GOT A BAD EAR FOR MUSIC JOSHUA
THEY'RE FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO FRIGHTEN THE BIRDS WITH--THAT'S TO SAY THE ENGLISH BIRDS FOR THE SCOTCH BIRDS MAY SING SCOTCH FOR WHAT I KNOW
BUT WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY
SETH TURNED HOMEWARDS AND DINAH CAME ON ALONE
HE ISNA CLIVER ENOUGH FOR THEE HAPPEN BUT HE'D HA BEEN VERY GOOD T THEE--HE'S AS HANDY AS CAN BE AT DOIN THINGS FOR ME WHEN I'M BAD AN HE'S AS FOND O THE BIBLE AN CHAPPELLIN AS THEE ART THYSEN
HER JOY AND PRIDE IN THE HONOUR PAID TO HER DARLING SON ADAM WAS BEGINNING TO BE WORSTED IN THE CONFLICT WITH THE JEALOUSY AND FRETFULNESS WHICH HAD REVIVED WHEN ADAM CAME TO TELL HER THAT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE DESIRED HIM TO JOIN THE DANCERS IN THE HALL
SHE COULD LIE NO LONGER
AND THEN HIS WEAKNESS IN COMING BACK FROM GAWAINE'S AND DOING THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE INTENDED
THE DEAR YOUNG ROUND SOFT FLEXIBLE THING
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE GAVE HIS MOST ELABORATE CIVILITY TO MRS POYSER TO-NIGHT INQUIRING PARTICULARLY ABOUT HER HEALTH RECOMMENDING HER TO STRENGTHEN HERSELF WITH COLD WATER AS HE DID AND AVOID ALL DRUGS
I'VE NEVER HARDLY KNOWN HIM TO MISS CHURCH BEFORE AYE SAID MR POYSER WE'VE HEARED NOTHING ABOUT HIM FOR IT'S THE BOYS HOLLODAYS NOW SO WE CAN GIVE YOU NO ACCOUNT BUT YOU'LL NIVER THINK O GOING THERE AT THIS HOUR O THE NIGHT SAID MRS POYSER FOLDING UP HER KNITTING
HE'D HA THOUGHT NOTHIN ON'T FOR SETH TO MA'S COFFIN SAY NO MORE ADAM SAY NO MORE SAID SETH GENTLY THOUGH HIS VOICE TOLD THAT HE SPOKE WITH SOME EFFORT
NOW HE WOULD HAVE ROOM AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTION AND HE WOULD USE THEM
SHE WAS GOING TO LET DOWN HER HAIR AND MAKE HERSELF LOOK LIKE THAT PICTURE OF A LADY IN MISS LYDIA DONNITHORNE'S DRESSING-ROOM
YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT NOT TO READ IT JUST YET SAID ADAM
WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT STAYING IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY WITH YOUR MOTHER AND BROTHER SHOWS ME THAT YOU HAVE A TRUE GUIDANCE
ADAM SAW HERE AN OPENING INTO A BROADENING PATH OF PROSPEROUS WORK SUCH AS HE HAD THOUGHT OF WITH AMBITIOUS LONGING EVER SINCE HE WAS A LAD
JUST TO SEE THEIR RUDDY ROUND CHEEKS ON THE PILLOW AND TO HEAR FOR A MOMENT THEIR LIGHT REGULAR BREATHING
SHE DESIRES TO ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS AND IT IS MEET YOU SHOULD SEE HER TO-DAY RATHER THAN IN THE EARLY MORNING WHEN THE TIME WILL BE SHORT ADAM STOOD TREMBLING AND AT LAST SANK DOWN ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
THE RAW BACON WHICH CLUMSY MOLLY SPARES FROM HER OWN SCANTY STORE THAT SHE MAY CARRY IT TO HER NEIGHBOUR'S CHILD TO STOP THE FITS MAY BE A PITEOUSLY INEFFICACIOUS REMEDY
NEVERTHELESS MRS POYSER DID NOT GO TO CHURCH FOR SHE HAD TAKEN A COLD TOO SERIOUS TO BE NEGLECTED
AND MR CRAIG WITH THE WONDERFUL HOTHOUSE PLANT IN HIS BUTTON-HOLE WAS STARING AT HER SHE KNEW
TO KNOW THAT NOTHING--NO NOT IF THE EARTH WAS TO BE BURNT UP OR THE WATERS COME AND DROWN US--NOTHING COULD PART US FROM GOD WHO LOVES US AND WHO FILLS OUR SOULS WITH PEACE AND JOY BECAUSE WE ARE SURE THAT WHATEVER HE WILLS IS HOLY JUST AND GOOD
COOM CHILD THEE'T COOM AT LAST SHE SAID WHEN DINAH WENT TOWARDS HER
BUT AT THE WORDS AND THEN TO BE HANGED BY THE NECK TILL YOU BE DEAD A PIERCING SHRIEK RANG THROUGH THE HALL
HER EYES CONTINUED TO WANDER BLANKLY UNTIL SETH CAME IN AND BEGAN TO REMOVE SOME OF THE SCATTERED THINGS AND CLEAR THE SMALL ROUND DEAL TABLE THAT HE MIGHT SET OUT HIS MOTHER'S TEA UPON IT
THE SIGN IS SO SLIGHT IT IS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR OR EYE--HE COULD DESCRIBE IT TO NO ONE--IT IS A MERE FEATHER-TOUCH YET IT SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED HIS WHOLE BEING TO HAVE MERGED AN UNEASY YEARNING INTO A DELICIOUS UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF EVERYTHING BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE SHE PARTED WITH HIM IN THE WOOD ON THURSDAY EVENING AND OH HOW LONG THE TIME HAD SEEMED
LOVE HE THOUGHT COULD NEVER BE ANYTHING TO HIM BUT A LIVING MEMORY--A LIMB LOPPED OFF BUT NOT GONE FROM CONSCIOUSNESS
IT MAKES LESS MOUTHS FOR THE SCANT CAKE
MR POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT
LOOK AT ME
EVERYTHING WAS FORGOTTEN BUT THE PAIN AND ANGER SHE FELT AT ADAM'S WORDS
AN DOST THINK THEE CANST GO ON SO ALL THY LIFE AS IF THEE WAST A MAN CUT OUT O TIMBER
HE HEARD NO MORE OF THE EVIDENCE AND WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION HAD CLOSED--UNCONSCIOUS THAT MR IRWINE WAS IN THE WITNESS-BOX TELLING OF HETTY'S UNBLEMISHED CHARACTER IN HER OWN PARISH AND OF THE VIRTUOUS HABITS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP
YOU DIDN'T THINK SHE COULD HAVE GOT HARDENED IN THAT LITTLE WHILE TO DO WHAT SHE'S DONE I KNOW--I KNOW THAT SAID ADAM
CHAPTER XVI LINKS ARTHUR DONNITHORNE YOU REMEMBER IS UNDER AN ENGAGEMENT WITH HIMSELF TO GO AND SEE MR IRWINE THIS FRIDAY MORNING AND HE IS AWAKE AND DRESSING SO EARLY THAT HE DETERMINES TO GO BEFORE BREAKFAST INSTEAD OF AFTER
I SHOULD NEVER HA COME TO KNOW THAT HER LOVE UD BE THE GREATEST O BLESSINGS TO ME IF WHAT I COUNTED A BLESSING HADN'T BEEN WRENCHED AND TORN AWAY FROM ME AND LEFT ME WITH A GREATER NEED SO AS I COULD CRAVE AND HUNGER FOR A GREATER AND A BETTER COMFORT HE EXPECTED TO SEE DINAH AGAIN THIS EVENING AND GET LEAVE TO ACCOMPANY HER AS FAR AS OAKBOURNE
IT'S BETTER THAN TWELVE MILES FROM SNOWFIELD SO WE SET OUT EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR IT WAS SUMMERTIME
HE WAS GOING TO CAST THE MASTER'S EYE ON THE SHOEING OF A NEW CART-HORSE CARRYING HIS SPUD AS A USEFUL COMPANION BY THE WAY
ADAM NOTICED GYP'S MENTAL CONFLICT AND THOUGH HIS ANGER HAD MADE HIM LESS TENDER THAN USUAL TO HIS MOTHER IT DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM CARING AS MUCH AS USUAL FOR HIS DOG
THERE'S NO COMFORT FOR ME NO MORE SHE WENT ON THE TEARS COMING WHEN SHE BEGAN TO SPEAK NOW THY POOR FEYTHER'S GONE AS I'N WASHED FOR AND MENDED AN GOT'S VICTUAL FOR HIM FOR THIRTY EAR AN HIM ALLAYS SO PLEASED WI IVERYTHING I DONE FOR HIM AN USED TO BE SO HANDY AN DO THE JOBS FOR ME WHEN I WAR ILL AN CUMBERED WI TH BABBY AN MADE ME THE POSSET AN BROUGHT IT UPSTAIRS AS PROUD AS COULD BE AN CARRIED THE LAD AS WAR AS HEAVY AS TWO CHILDREN FOR FIVE MILE AN NE'ER GRUMBLED ALL THE WAY TO WARSON WAKE CAUSE I WANTED TO GO AN SEE MY SISTER AS WAR DEAD AN GONE THE VERY NEXT CHRISTMAS AS E'ER COME
I LEFT THE HOUSE ABOUT HALF-PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK
WHAT WAS THE GROUND FOR PAINTING THE FUTURE IN THAT DARK WAY
I'LL GO TO WORK AND DO THEE STAY AT HOME HE PASSED INTO THE WORKSHOP IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY ADAM
BUT I FEAR I FEAR THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IT IS HETTY
SHE NEVER HAD A CHILD
HE NO SOONER FIXED HIS MIND ON THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS WHICH HAD STOLEN OVER HIM TO-DAY--OF CONTINUING TO NOTICE HETTY OF ALLOWING HIMSELF ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH SLIGHT CARESSES AS HE HAD BEEN BETRAYED INTO ALREADY--THAN HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE SUCH A FUTURE POSSIBLE FOR HIMSELF
IF YOU COULD BELIEVE HE LOVED YOU AND WOULD HELP YOU AS YOU BELIEVE I LOVE YOU AND WILL HELP YOU IT WOULDN'T BE SO HARD TO DIE ON MONDAY WOULD IT BUT I CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HETTY SAID WITH SULLEN SADNESS
AND SO I AM STRAITENED AND SAY BUT LITTLE OF WHAT IS IN MY MIND
I CAN COUNT A STOCKING-TOP WHILE A MAN'S GETTING'S TONGUE READY AN WHEN HE OUTS WI HIS SPEECH AT LAST THERE'S LITTLE BROTH TO BE MADE ON'T
FOR ADAM HAD A DEVOUT MIND THOUGH HE WAS PERHAPS RATHER IMPATIENT OF DEVOUT WORDS AND HIS TENDERNESS LAY VERY CLOSE TO HIS REVERENCE SO THAT THE ONE COULD HARDLY BE STIRRED WITHOUT THE OTHER
HE WORE HIS EVERYDAY LOOK OF UNEXPECTANT CALM
AND PERHAPS I JUDGED YOU TOO HARSH--I'M APT TO BE HARSH--AND YOU MAY HAVE ACTED OUT O THOUGHTLESSNESS MORE THAN I SHOULD HA BELIEVED WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN WITH A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE
BUT I FEEL AS MUCH BOUND TO TELL YOU AS PRECISELY AS I CAN WHAT THAT REFLECTION IS AS IF I WERE IN THE WITNESS-BOX NARRATING MY EXPERIENCE ON OATH
THE MAN MAY BE NO BETTER ABLE THAN THE DOG TO EXPLAIN THE INFLUENCE THE MORE REFINED BEAUTY HAS ON HIM BUT HE FEELS IT BLESS ME DAUPHIN WHAT DOES AN OLD BACHELOR LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT OH THAT IS ONE OF THE MATTERS IN WHICH OLD BACHELORS ARE WISER THAN MARRIED MEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TIME FOR MORE GENERAL CONTEMPLATION
I WISH HE'D GOT TH ESTATE IN HIS HANDS
IF YOU WAS BEING COURTED BY ANY MAN AS UD MAKE YOU HIS WIFE AND I'D KNOWN YOU WAS FOND OF HIM AND MEANT TO HAVE HIM I SHOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK A WORD TO YOU ABOUT IT
DOUBTLESS IT WILL BE DESPISED AS A WEAKNESS BY THAT LOFTY ORDER OF MINDS WHO PANT AFTER THE IDEAL AND ARE OPPRESSED BY A GENERAL SENSE THAT THEIR EMOTIONS ARE OF TOO EXQUISITE A CHARACTER TO FIND FIT OBJECTS AMONG THEIR EVERYDAY FELLOWMEN
HETTY BLUSHED A DEEP ROSE-COLOUR WHEN CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE ENTERED THE DAIRY AND SPOKE TO HER
ALAS
BUT AT LAST DEEP DREAMLESS SLEEP CAME
WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU ARTHUR CONTINUED IS THIS
IT'S EASY FINDING REASONS WHY OTHER FOLKS SHOULD BE PATIENT MR MASSEY SAID ADAM PENITENTLY I'M VERY HOT AND HASTY
THIS TESTIMONY COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON THE VERDICT BUT IT WAS GIVEN AS PART OF THAT PLEA FOR MERCY WHICH HER OWN COUNSEL WOULD HAVE MADE IF HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK FOR HER--A FAVOUR NOT GRANTED TO CRIMINALS IN THOSE STERN TIMES
AND THERE'S NAYTHER LOVE NOR MONEY HERE AS I CAN SEE ON'Y OTHER FOLKS'S LOVE O THEIRSELVES AND THE MONEY AS IS TO GO INTO OTHER FOLKS'S POCKETS
ADAM LOOKED AT HER
AFTER THE FIRST ON-COMING OF HER GREAT DREAD SOME WEEKS AFTER HER BETROTHAL TO ADAM SHE HAD WAITED AND WAITED IN THE BLIND VAGUE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM HER TERROR
NAY BILL NAY BARTLE WAS SAYING IN A KIND TONE AS HE NODDED TO ADAM BEGIN THAT AGAIN AND THEN PERHAPS IT'LL COME TO YOU WHAT D-R-Y SPELLS
IT MUST BE TWO O'CLOCK FOR THERE IS THE GONG BEGINNING TO SOUND FOR THE TENANTS DINNERS CHAPTER XXIII DINNER-TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
I'M NO OPINION O THE METHODISTS
HE KNEW NOTHING THAT COULD SUGGEST TO HIM A REASON FOR HETTY'S GOING AWAY
THERE'S NO WORK SO TIRIN AS DANGLIN ABOUT AN STARIN AN NOT RIGHTLY KNOWIN WHAT YOU'RE GOIN TO DO NEXT
WHY NOT WHY SHE'S GOT LAMED LAMED CONFOUND YOU
HE HAD NO MESSAGE TO DELIVER FROM HETTY NOW FOR HETTY HAD SEEN ARTHUR
AN I SHALL BE NOUGHT BUT CUMBER A-SITTIN I TH CHIMNEY-CORNER
THE MAN LOOKED AT HER WITH A SLOW BOVINE GAZE WITHOUT GIVING HER ANY ANSWER FOR SOME SECONDS
IF A CHEST FULL OF LACE AND SATIN AND JEWELS HAD BEEN SENT HER FROM SOME UNKNOWN SOURCE HOW COULD SHE BUT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HER WHOLE LOT WAS GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT TO-MORROW SOME STILL MORE BEWILDERING JOY WOULD BEFALL HER
MY HEART BLEEDS FOR HER AS I SEE HER TOILING ALONG ON HER WEARY FEET OR SEATED IN A CART WITH HER EYES FIXED VACANTLY ON THE ROAD BEFORE HER NEVER THINKING OR CARING WHITHER IT TENDS TILL HUNGER COMES AND MAKES HER DESIRE THAT A VILLAGE MAY BE NEAR
AND FULL AS HE WAS OF VAGUE FEELING THERE WAS ROOM IN THOSE MOMENTS OF SILENCE FOR THE THOUGHT THAT HIS PREVIOUS DEBATES AND SCRUPLES WERE NEEDLESS
THAT SIMPLE DANCING OF WELL-COVERED MATRONS LAYING ASIDE FOR AN HOUR THE CARES OF HOUSE AND DAIRY REMEMBERING BUT NOT AFFECTING YOUTH NOT JEALOUS BUT PROUD OF THE YOUNG MAIDENS BY THEIR SIDE--THAT HOLIDAY SPRIGHTLINESS OF PORTLY HUSBANDS PAYING LITTLE COMPLIMENTS TO THEIR WIVES AS IF THEIR COURTING DAYS WERE COME AGAIN--THOSE LADS AND LASSES A LITTLE CONFUSED AND AWKWARD WITH THEIR PARTNERS HAVING NOTHING TO SAY--IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT VARIETY TO SEE ALL THAT SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF LOW DRESSES AND LARGE SKIRTS AND SCANNING GLANCES EXPLORING COSTUMES AND LANGUID MEN IN LACQUERED BOOTS SMILING WITH DOUBLE MEANING
AFTER SPEAKING TO THE JAILER THE MAGISTRATE TURNED TO HER AND SAID THE TURNKEY WILL TAKE YOU TO THE PRISONER'S CELL AND LEAVE YOU THERE FOR THE NIGHT IF YOU DESIRE IT BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE A LIGHT DURING THE NIGHT--IT IS CONTRARY TO RULES
I THOUGHT IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW HERE LAW
BESSY I AM SORRY TO SAY HAD TAKEN TO HER EAR-RINGS AGAIN SINCE DINAH'S DEPARTURE AND WAS OTHERWISE DECKED OUT IN SUCH SMALL FINERY AS SHE COULD MUSTER
THE SCENT OF WHEY DEPARTED FROM THE FARM-HOUSES AND THE SCENT OF BREWING CAME IN ITS STEAD
I BEAR HER ON MY ARMS AND CARRY HER BEFORE THEE
THEY WENT ABOUT IN THEIR YOUTH IN FLANNEL OR PAPER CAPS IN COATS BLACK WITH COAL-DUST OR STREAKED WITH LIME AND RED PAINT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN-BAGS
IT'S THE METHODISSES AS IS LIKE TO GET TH UPPER HAND I TH PARISH IF YOUR REVERENCE AN HIS HONOUR SQUIRE DONNITHORNE DOESNA THINK WELL TO SAY THE WORD AN FORBID IT
THEE MUSTNA LOSE HEART
MY MOTHER AND I HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU SOMETIMES
MR CASSON THE LANDLORD HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME STANDING AT THE DOOR WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS BALANCING HIMSELF ON HIS HEELS AND TOES AND LOOKING TOWARDS A PIECE OF UNENCLOSED GROUND WITH A MAPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHICH HE KNEW TO BE THE DESTINATION OF CERTAIN GRAVE-LOOKING MEN AND WOMEN WHOM HE HAD OBSERVED PASSING AT INTERVALS
SETH'S FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT HIS BROTHER
THE SHERIFF KNOWS HIM
BUT HE BEGAN TO SEE THROUGH THE DIMNESS--TO SEE THE DARK EYES LIFTED UP TO HIM ONCE MORE BUT WITH NO SMILE IN THEM
THE LEAVES WERE MOTIONLESS AND THE LIGHT OF THE STARS SHOWED THE PLACID FIELDS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BROOK QUITE EMPTY OF VISIBLE LIFE
I MEANT THE THOUGHT OF YOU WAS WORTH SO MUCH TO ME I SHOULD FEEL I OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL AND NOT GRUMBLE IF YOU SEE RIGHT TO GO AWAY
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE I MUST TELL YOU SIR
FIVE DAYS AFTER DELIVERING ARTHUR'S LETTER HE HAD VENTURED TO GO TO THE HALL FARM AGAIN--NOT WITHOUT DREAD LEST THE SIGHT OF HIM MIGHT BE PAINFUL TO HER
FOR AS FOR THE MOUNSEERS YOU MAY SKEWER HALF-A-DOZEN OF EM AT ONCE AS IF THEY WAR FROGS AYE AYE SAID MARTIN POYSER LISTENING WITH AN AIR OF MUCH INTELLIGENCE AND EDIFICATION THEY NE'ER ATE A BIT O BEEF I THEIR LIVES
I COULDN'T HELP IT DINAH
MARTIN POYSER WAS NOT A FREQUENTER OF PUBLIC HOUSES BUT HE LIKED A FRIENDLY CHAT OVER HIS OWN HOME-BREWED
BUT THE HEARTS OF THE HEAD-SERVANTS WERE HEAVY THAT DAY FOR ANOTHER CAUSE THAN THE DEATH OF THE OLD SQUIRE AND MORE THAN ONE OF THEM WAS LONGING TO BE TWENTY MILES AWAY AS MR CRAIG WAS KNOWING WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HETTY SORREL--PRETTY HETTY SORREL--WHOM THEY USED TO SEE EVERY WEEK
THEE'T TIRED
SHE WAS NO MORE CONSCIOUS OF HER LIMBS THAN IF HER CHILDISH SOUL HAD PASSED INTO A WATER-LILY RESTING ON A LIQUID BED AND WARMED BY THE MIDSUMMER SUN-BEAMS
SHE LEANED FORWARD ON HER ELBOWS AND LOOKED INTO THOSE DARK OVERFLOODING EYES AND AT THE QUIVERING MOUTH AND SAW HOW THE TEARS CAME THICKER AND THICKER AND HOW THE MOUTH BECAME CONVULSED WITH SOBS
AND EVEN IF YOU'D MARRY SETH BEDE AS IS A POOR WOOL-GATHERING METHODIST AND'S NEVER LIKE TO HAVE A PENNY BEFOREHAND I KNOW YOUR UNCLE UD HELP YOU WITH A PIG AND VERY LIKE A COW FOR HE'S ALLAYS BEEN GOOD-NATUR'D TO MY KIN FOR ALL THEY'RE POOR AND MADE EM WELCOME TO THE HOUSE
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE HE LODGES
I SUPPOSE THE PLACE IS A GOOD DEAL CHANGED BY THE EMPLOYMENT THAT MILL MUST HAVE BROUGHT IT IS CHANGED SO FAR AS THE MILL HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE THERE WHO GET A LIVELIHOOD FOR THEMSELVES BY WORKING IN IT AND MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE TRADESFOLKS
SHE HAD SAT IN THIS WAY PERFECTLY STILL WITH HER HANDS CROSSED ON HER LAP AND THE PALE LIGHT RESTING ON HER CALM FACE FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY A LOUD SOUND APPARENTLY OF SOMETHING FALLING IN HETTY'S ROOM
THE HAPPY FACES ARTHUR SAW GREETING HIM WERE NOT PALE ABSTRACTIONS BUT REAL RUDDY FACES LONG FAMILIAR TO HIM
THESE FELLOW-MORTALS EVERY ONE MUST BE ACCEPTED AS THEY ARE
IT'S YOUR DEAD CHICKS TAKE THE LONGEST HATCHIN HOWIVER I'M NOT DENYIN THE WOMEN ARE FOOLISH
THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE-LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
AND I LONGED TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN TO-NIGHT FOR IT IS THE LAST BUT ONE THAT I SHALL BE HERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO-MORROW TO KEEP US APART
THEN SHE KNEW HER CHEEKS WERE GLOWING AND DARED NOT LOOK ROUND BUT STOOD STILL DISTRESSED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT SAY GOOD-MORNING IN A FRIENDLY WAY
YOU THINK KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE GOT CHEAP--YOU'LL COME AND PAY BARTLE MASSEY SIXPENCE A-WEEK AND HE'LL MAKE YOU CLEVER AT FIGURES WITHOUT YOUR TAKING ANY TROUBLE
BUT HE DOUBTED THE LASS WAS O'ERDOING IT--SHE MUST HAVE A BIT O REST WHEN HER AUNT COULD COME DOWNSTAIRS THIS DESIRABLE EVENT OF MRS POYSER'S COMING DOWNSTAIRS HAPPENED IN THE EARLY PART OF FEBRUARY WHEN SOME MILD WEATHER THAWED THE LAST PATCH OF SNOW ON THE BINTON HILLS
THOSE WERE HAPPY DAYS ESPECIALLY WHEN SETH WHO WAS THREE YEARS THE YOUNGER BEGAN TO GO OUT WORKING TOO AND ADAM BEGAN TO BE A TEACHER AS WELL AS A LEARNER
THEY SAY THE JAIL CHAPLAINS ARE MOSTLY THE FAG-END O THE CLERGY THERE'S ONE MAN AS OUGHT TO BE THERE SAID ADAM BITTERLY
AFTER THIS THE COUNTRY GREW BARER AND BARER
IS SHE MUCH DOWN ABOUT THE OLD MAN
YOU PERCEIVE CLEARLY WHAT SORT OF PICTURE ADAM AND HETTY MADE IN THE PANORAMA OF ARTHUR'S THOUGHTS ON HIS JOURNEY HOMEWARD
AND THEN FOLLOWED A DISCUSSION ON THE SECRETS OF GOOD BREWING THE FOLLY OF STINGINESS IN HOPPING AND THE DOUBTFUL ECONOMY OF A FARMER'S MAKING HIS OWN MALT
YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF AND SAY THAT THE EVIL WHICH IS IN YOU SHALL NOT SPREAD
AND SO'S YOUR AUNT I'LL BE BOUND FOR SHE'S DONE BY YOU THIS SEVEN EAR HETTY AS IF YOU'D BEEN HER OWN
THOU--THOU WILT BREATHE ON THE DEAD SOUL AND IT SHALL ARISE FROM THE UNANSWERING SLEEP OF DEATH
I TELL YOU AS YOU'VE FILLED HER MIND SO WITH THE THOUGHT OF YOU AS IT'LL MAYHAP POISON HER LIFE AND SHE'LL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER MAN AS UD MAKE HER A GOOD HUSBAND ARTHUR HAD FELT A SUDDEN RELIEF WHILE ADAM WAS SPEAKING
AND WHERE AT EVERY TURN HE CAME UPON SOME FINE OLD COUNTRY-SEAT NESTLED IN THE VALLEY OR CROWNING THE SLOPE SOME HOMESTEAD WITH ITS LONG LENGTH OF BARN AND ITS CLUSTER OF GOLDEN RICKS SOME GREY STEEPLE LOOKING OUT FROM A PRETTY CONFUSION OF TREES AND THATCH AND DARK-RED TILES
TOTTY IS LARGER BY MORE THAN TWO YEARS GROWTH THAN WHEN YOU FIRST SAW HER AND SHE HAS ON A BLACK FROCK UNDER HER PINAFORE
THE BEGINNING OF HARDSHIP IS LIKE THE FIRST TASTE OF BITTER FOOD--IT SEEMS FOR A MOMENT UNBEARABLE
IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT ADAM IN THE INCESSANT OCCUPATION OF HIS MIND ABOUT HETTY SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALIGHTED ON THE PROBABILITY THAT SHE HAD GONE TO WINDSOR IGNORANT THAT ARTHUR WAS NO LONGER THERE
WHAT IS THERE WRONG I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW I STAYING ALONG WI YOUR OWN FRIENDS AS ARE TH HAPPIER FOR HAVING YOU WITH EM AN ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE FOR YOU EVEN IF YOUR WORK DIDN'T MORE NOR PAY EM FOR THE BIT O SPARROW'S VICTUAL Y EAT AND THE BIT O RAG YOU PUT ON
THAT LOOK WAS TOO MUCH
TELL ME WHAT THEY'VE SAID
HE WOULD SLIP INTO OLD BURGE'S SHOES AND MAKE A FINE THING OF THAT BUILDING BUSINESS I'LL ANSWER FOR HIM
WHEN MILLS GOT TO THE STABLES A HORSE WAS BEING SADDLED AND ARTHUR WAS FORCING HIMSELF TO READ THE REMAINING WORDS OF THE LETTER
HE'S BEEN TRIFLING WITH YOU AND MAKING A PLAYTHING OF YOU AND CARING NOTHING ABOUT YOU AS A MAN OUGHT TO CARE YES HE DOES CARE FOR ME
IF YOU WERE TO HAVE THE HOLLOW PASTURES YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR DAIRY WHICH MUST BE SO PROFITABLE UNDER YOUR WIFE'S MANAGEMENT
BUT NOW DO YE MAKE THE TAY AS YE LIKE IT FOR I'N GOT NO TASTE I MY MOUTH THIS DAY--IT'S ALL ONE WHAT I SWALLER--IT'S ALL GOT THE TASTE O SORROW WI'T DINAH TOOK CARE NOT TO BETRAY THAT SHE HAD HAD HER TEA AND ACCEPTED LISBETH'S INVITATION VERY READILY FOR THE SAKE OF PERSUADING THE OLD WOMAN HERSELF TO TAKE THE FOOD AND DRINK SHE SO MUCH NEEDED AFTER A DAY OF HARD WORK AND FASTING
I COULD WORSHIP THAT WOMAN
BUT NOW SHE CAME AND SAT DOWN OPPOSITE DINAH WHOM SHE LOOKED AT IN A MEDITATIVE WAY AS SHE KNITTED HER GREY WORSTED STOCKING
ARTHUR WAS IN THE WRETCHED POSITION OF AN OPEN GENEROUS MAN WHO HAS COMMITTED AN ERROR WHICH MAKES DECEPTION SEEM A NECESSITY
THEY WERE FOR THE MISERY OF HER OWN LOT WHICH TOOK HER AWAY FROM THIS BRAVE TENDER MAN WHO OFFERED UP HIS WHOLE LIFE TO HER AND THREW HER A POOR HELPLESS SUPPLIANT ON THE MAN WHO WOULD THINK IT A MISFORTUNE THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CLING TO HIM
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY WITH ME FOR COMING NAY NAY
A NATURE LIKE ADAM'S WITH A GREAT NEED OF LOVE AND REVERENCE IN IT DEPENDS FOR SO MUCH OF ITS HAPPINESS ON WHAT IT CAN BELIEVE AND FEEL ABOUT OTHERS
WHEN HE RETURNED WITH HIS BASKET LEAKING BUT STILL HALF-FULL ARTHUR LOOKED AT HIM WITH A MORE THOROUGHLY REAWAKENED CONSCIOUSNESS
AND THE CHEEK WAS NEVER DIMPLED WITH SMILES NOW
PLENTY OF LIFE THERE THOUGH THIS IS THE DROWSIEST TIME OF THE YEAR JUST BEFORE HAY-HARVEST
BUT THE MOTHER'S YEARNING THAT COMPLETEST TYPE OF THE LIFE IN ANOTHER LIFE WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF REAL HUMAN LOVE FEELS THE PRESENCE OF THE CHERISHED CHILD EVEN IN THE DEBASED DEGRADED MAN
BUT WHATIVER DID YOU LET HER RUN AWAY FROM YOU ALONG WI TOMMY FOR AND STUFF HERSELF WI FRUIT AS SHE CAN'T EAT A BIT O GOOD VICTUAL THIS WAS SAID IN A LOWER TONE THAN USUAL WHILE HER HUSBAND WAS TALKING TO ADAM
YOU KNOW SHE SHRINKS FROM SEEING ANY ONE ADAM
AN I HEAR AS SHE'S A-GOIN AWAY BACK TO HER OWN COUNTRY SOON
BUT HE'S FOND O GETTING AWAY FOR A BIT NOW AND THEN
IT ISN'T FOR MEN TO MAKE CHANNELS FOR GOD'S SPIRIT AS THEY MAKE CHANNELS FOR THE WATERCOURSES AND SAY FLOW HERE BUT FLOW NOT THERE BUT DON'T YOU FIND SOME DANGER AMONG YOUR PEOPLE--I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT IT IS SO WITH YOU FAR FROM IT--BUT DON'T YOU FIND SOMETIMES THAT BOTH MEN AND WOMEN FANCY THEMSELVES CHANNELS FOR GOD'S SPIRIT AND ARE QUITE MISTAKEN SO THAT THEY SET ABOUT A WORK FOR WHICH THEY ARE UNFIT AND BRING HOLY THINGS INTO CONTEMPT DOUBTLESS IT IS SO SOMETIMES
THE THRUSTING OUT OF HIS CHIN AND STOMACH AND THE TWIRLING OF HIS THUMBS ARE MORE SUBTLE INDICATIONS INTENDED TO PREPARE UNWARY STRANGERS FOR THE DISCOVERY THAT THEY ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PARISH CLERK
HE DID NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT ADAM BUT GLANCED CARELESSLY ROUND AT THE TREES AND THEN LIFTED UP ONE FOOT TO LOOK AT THE SOLE OF HIS BOOT
WAS THERE ANY MAN IN LOAMSHIRE WHO KNEW BETTER THE NATUR OF ALL FARMING WORK
I OFTEN THINK OF THEM WORDS AND JACOB SERVED SEVEN YEARS FOR RACHEL
OUR DEEDS CARRY THEIR TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES QUITE APART FROM ANY FLUCTUATIONS THAT WENT BEFORE--CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE HARDLY EVER CONFINED TO OURSELVES
HE'S A CLEVER WORKMAN AN TAUGHT THEE THY TRADE REMEMBER AN'S NIVER GEN ME A BLOW NOR SO MUCH AS AN ILL WORD--NO NOT EVEN IN S DRINK
BUT THAT SORROW SEEMED TO HAVE MADE IT ITSELF FEEBLY FELT HITHERTO NOW WHEN ADAM BEDE'S TALL FIGURE WAS SUDDENLY SEEN BEING USHERED TO THE SIDE OF THE PRISONER'S DOCK
FAREWELL DEAR BROTHER--AND YET NOT FAREWELL
BUT I HEREWITH DISCHARGE MY CONSCIENCE AND DECLARE THAT I HAVE HAD QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC MOVEMENTS OF ADMIRATION TOWARDS OLD GENTLEMEN WHO SPOKE THE WORST ENGLISH WHO WERE OCCASIONALLY FRETFUL IN THEIR TEMPER AND WHO HAD NEVER MOVED IN A HIGHER SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THAN THAT OF PARISH OVERSEER
A GREAT TERROR WAS UPON HER AND WRENCHING HER EAR-RINGS FROM HER EARS SHE THREW THEM DOWN BEFORE HER SOBBING ALOUD
BUT WHERE'S FATHER SAID ADAM QUICKLY AS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND GLANCED INTO THE ROOM ON THE LEFT HAND WHICH WAS USED AS A WORKSHOP
BUT THIS CLOCK'S SO MUCH BEFORE THE CLOCK AT THE CHASE THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT TIME IT'LL BE WHEN I GET HERE WHAT
AND PERHAPS HEREAFTER HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO A GREAT DEAL FOR HER AND MAKE UP TO HER FOR ALL THE TEARS SHE WOULD SHED ABOUT HIM
IF WE LOCK TH HOUSE UP ALL THE MEN CAN GO
WE HAVE TO SEE IF IT IS REALLY HETTY WHO IS THERE YOU KNOW YES SIR SAID ADAM I'LL DO WHAT YOU THINK RIGHT
I'D WORK MY RIGHT HAND OFF SOONER THAN DECEIVE PEOPLE WITH LIES I THAT WAY
I KNOW AS MUCH O THE WORDS O THE BIBLE AS HE DOES AN COULD SAY THE PSALMS RIGHT THROUGH I MY SLEEP IF YOU WAS TO PINCH ME
AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH
A MERRY DAY FOR THE CHILDREN WHO RAN AND SHOUTED TO SEE IF THEY COULD TOP THE WIND WITH THEIR VOICES
IT'S THEM AS TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT GET ADVANTAGE I THIS WORLD I THINK
MY OLD MAN COME FROM THAT STONYSHIRE SIDE BUT HE LEFT IT WHEN HE WAR A YOUNG UN AN I THE RIGHT ON'T TOO
IT SPOKE BRIEFLY AND SIMPLY OF THE WORDS IN THE MIDST OF LIFE WE ARE IN DEATH"--HOW THE PRESENT MOMENT IS ALL WE CAN CALL OUR OWN FOR WORKS OF MERCY OF RIGHTEOUS DEALING AND OF FAMILY TENDERNESS
BUT HE SAYS HE DOESN'T MEAN TO COME HOME
IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST
HE WANTED ADAM TO KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER SHE WAS THAN ALL OTHER WOMEN
IT WAS THE ONE PERFORMANCE OF HERS THAT HER AUNT ALLOWED TO PASS WITHOUT SEVERE CRITICISM
YOU JUDGE O YOUR GARDEN-STUFF ON A BETTER PLAN THAN THAT
AND I COUNSEL THEE NOT TO DO'T
BUT ANYWAY SHE ISNA GOING BEFORE THE HARVEST SUPPER O WEDNESDAY AND YOU MUST COME THEN
YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT INTO HIS MOUTH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS--QUITE AS GOOD AS READING A SERMON CERTAINLY I COULD IF I HELD IT THE HIGHEST VOCATION OF THE NOVELIST TO REPRESENT THINGS AS THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN AND NEVER WILL BE
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HIS FAULTS AS WE FORGET THE SORROWS OF OUR DEPARTED CHILDHOOD AND THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE YOUNG HUSBAND'S KINDNESS AND THE OLD MAN'S PATIENCE
BUT A TENDER HEART MAKES ONE STUPID
MR CASSON'S PERSON WAS BY NO MEANS OF THAT COMMON TYPE WHICH CAN BE ALLOWED TO PASS WITHOUT DESCRIPTION
BUT WHY DID NOT ARTHUR RISE
AND OUR LOVE IS INWROUGHT IN OUR ENTHUSIASM AS ELECTRICITY IS INWROUGHT IN THE AIR EXALTING ITS POWER BY A SUBTLE PRESENCE
IT WAS ALONG THE BROADEST OF THESE PATHS THAT ARTHUR DONNITHORNE PASSED UNDER AN AVENUE OF LIMES AND BEECHES
BUT HETTY WAS SIMPLY IN THAT EXCITABLE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH THERE IS NO CALCULATING WHAT TURN THE FEELINGS MAY TAKE FROM ONE MOMENT TO ANOTHER AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE BECAME IRRITATED UNDER DINAH'S CARESS
NEXT TO BESSY JUST WITHIN THE CHURCH DOOR THERE WERE THE POYSER CHILDREN PEEPING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE PEWS TO GET A SIGHT OF THE MYSTERIOUS CEREMONY
WRETCHEDNESS THAT SHE DID NOT DARE TO FACE DEATH
BUT IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT YOU TOO HAVE BEEN IN LOVE--PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN ONCE THOUGH YOU MAY NOT CHOOSE TO SAY SO TO ALL YOUR FEMININE FRIENDS
AND SHE HAD THE LETTER IN HER POCKET
YOU KNOW WHO'S THE MAN I'VE RECKONED MY GREATEST FRIEND HE SAID AND USED TO BE PROUD TO THINK AS I SHOULD PASS MY LIFE I WORKING FOR HIM AND HAD FELT SO EVER SINCE WE WERE LADS MR IRWINE AS IF ALL SELF-CONTROL HAD FORSAKEN HIM GRASPED ADAM'S ARM WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE AND CLUTCHING IT TIGHTLY LIKE A MAN IN PAIN SAID WITH PALE LIPS AND A LOW HURRIED VOICE NO ADAM NO--DON'T SAY IT FOR GOD'S SAKE ADAM SURPRISED AT THE VIOLENCE OF MR IRWINE'S FEELING REPENTED OF THE WORDS THAT HAD PASSED HIS LIPS AND SAT IN DISTRESSED SILENCE
LOOK AT THE CLOCK DO
OPPRESSED WITH THIS NEW ALARM SHE WALKED ALONG THE GRIM STONITON STREETS AND AT LAST TURNED INTO A SHABBY LITTLE INN WHERE SHE HOPED TO GET A CHEAP LODGING FOR THE NIGHT
HEGH HEGH SAID THE COACHMAN SEEING THAT HIS JOKE WAS NOT SO GRATIFYING AS HE HAD EXPECTED YOU MUNNA TAKE IT TOO SER'OUS
WHAT DOST SAY I'M WILLING SAID SETH
BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS
AND ALL WITHOUT ANY GREAT EXPENSE FOR MATERIALS
THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME FOR ADAM TO TAKE A MEAL AND YET TO GET TO OAKBOURNE BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK
BUT YOU WON'T BE THERE YOURSELF ANY LONGER HE SAID TO DINAH
SHE HAD WEPT THEM ALL AWAY LAST NIGHT AND NOW SHE FELT THAT DRY-EYED MORNING MISERY WHICH IS WORSE THAN THE FIRST SHOCK BECAUSE IT HAS THE FUTURE IN IT AS WELL AS THE PRESENT
IT IS TURNED OFF THE MOULD WITH SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FIRM SURFACE LIKE MARBLE IN A PALE YELLOW LIGHT
BUT WHEN THEY SAW HETTY THEY PAUSED AND SHOOK HANDS
AH HE WAS A FINE MAN AS EVER YOU SET EYES ON
THE EYES HAD NO PECULIAR BEAUTY BEYOND THAT OF EXPRESSION
I'VE ALLAYS HAD HEALTH AND STRENGTH AND BRAINS TO GIVE ME A DELIGHT IN MY WORK
SHE WOULD NOT CONFESS EVEN TO DINAH
I SEE HIM COMING ALONG BY THE CRAB-TREE MEADOW ON A BALD-FACED HOSS
SHE'S NEITHER FOR YOU NOR FOR ME TO WIN I DOUBT
AND IN THIS MOMENT OF CHILL BARE WINTRY DISAPPOINTMENT AND DOUBT SHE LOOKED TOWARDS THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING WITH ARTHUR AGAIN OF MEETING HIS LOVING GLANCE AND HEARING HIS SOFT WORDS WITH THAT EAGER YEARNING WHICH ONE MAY CALL THE GROWING PAIN OF PASSION
ARTHUR HAD JUST POURED OUT SOME MORE BRANDY-AND-WATER AND HE THREW ONE ARM BEHIND HIS HEAD AND DREW UP ONE LEG IN AN ATTITUDE OF RECOVERED EASE WHICH WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION TO ADAM TO SPEAK WHAT WAS ON HIS MIND
I DARESAY NOW SHE'LL MARRY A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER JUST AS PRETTY IF SHE HAD HAD ROUND EYES AND RED HAIR ARTHUR DARED NOT TURN HIS EYES TOWARDS HETTY WHILE MRS IRWINE WAS SPEAKING OF HER
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD SOME CARE ON YOUR MIND WHY YES SIR
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO BE DONE
FOH SAYS MY IDEALISTIC FRIEND WHAT VULGAR DETAILS
SHE MUST NOT CRY IN THE DAY-TIME
SHE HAD ALREADY ADDRESSED SANDY JIM WHO WAS NOW HOLDING THE BABY TO RELIEVE HIS WIFE AND THE BIG SOFT-HEARTED MAN HAD RUBBED AWAY SOME TEARS WITH HIS FIST WITH A CONFUSED INTENTION OF BEING A BETTER FELLOW GOING LESS TO THE HOLLY BUSH DOWN BY THE STONE-PITS AND CLEANING HIMSELF MORE REGULARLY OF A SUNDAY
AND WHEN THEY REJOINED HER AUNT AND UNCLE SHE COULD PURSUE HER THOUGHTS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FOR MR POYSER HELD THAT THOUGH A YOUNG MAN MIGHT LIKE TO HAVE THE WOMAN HE WAS COURTING ON HIS ARM HE WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE GLAD OF A LITTLE REASONABLE TALK ABOUT BUSINESS THE WHILE
BARTLE MASSEY WHOSE EARS WERE RATHER SENSITIVE HAD GONE OUT TO SEE WHAT SORT OF EVENING IT WAS AT AN EARLY STAGE IN THE CEREMONY AND HAD NOT FINISHED HIS CONTEMPLATION UNTIL A SILENCE OF FIVE MINUTES DECLARED THAT DRINK BOYS DRINK WAS NOT LIKELY TO BEGIN AGAIN FOR THE NEXT TWELVEMONTH
THEY CHOSE A SHORTER WAY HOMEWARDS WHICH WOULD TAKE THEM ACROSS THE FIELDS AND THE BROOK IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
LISBETH HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SILENT SINCE SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS APPARENTLY REQUIRING SOME TIME TO ADJUST HER IDEAS TO A STATE OF THINGS IN WHICH SHE CAME DOWN LIKE A LADY TO FIND ALL THE WORK DONE AND SAT STILL TO BE WAITED ON
AND IF NO ONE HAD TOLD HIM THE CONTRARY HE COULD HAVE PERSUADED HIMSELF SO MUCH BETTER
ART READY FOR THE BASKET EH GYP SAID ADAM WITH THE SAME GENTLE MODULATION OF VOICE AS WHEN HE SPOKE TO SETH
I'LL PRAY GOD TO HELP YOU AS I PRAY HIM TO HELP ME BUT THERE'S THAT SWEET WOMAN--THAT DINAH MORRIS ARTHUR SAID PURSUING HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD BEEN THE SENSE OF ADAM'S WORDS SHE SAYS SHE SHALL STAY WITH HER TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT--TILL SHE GOES
BUT HETTY'S FACE HAD A LANGUAGE THAT TRANSCENDED HER FEELINGS
THERE'S THAT JIM WAKEFIELD AS THEY USED TO CALL GENTLEMAN WAKEFIELD USED TO DO THE SAME OF A SUNDAY AS O WEEKDAYS AND TOOK NO HEED TO RIGHT OR WRONG AS IF THERE WAS NAYTHER GOD NOR DEVIL
ARTHUR STROLLED ALONG CARELESSLY WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM BUT NOT LOOKING ON THE GROUND AS MEDITATIVE MEN ARE APT TO DO
WELL SIR WHEN I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING I CAN MOSTLY FIND WORDS TO SAY IT IN THANK GOD
SHE HAD SET HER HEART ON THAT SWEET SOUL
THEE'T SO STIFF AN MASTERFUL THEE'T NE'ER DO AS THY MOTHER WANTS THEE
I CAN HARDLY MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT AS A STORY BUT IT'S A STRANGE STRIKING THING
SHE HAD LAID DOWN HER WORK AND STOOD UP INSTINCTIVELY AS HE APPROACHED HER
WE MUST LEARN TO SEE THE GOOD IN THE MIDST OF MUCH THAT IS UNLOVELY AH SAID ADAM I LIKE TO READ ABOUT MOSES BEST IN TH OLD TESTAMENT
BUT NOW SHE HAD DONE EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO-DAY IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH--HAD DONE IT ALL HERSELF WITH SOME AID FROM HER SONS IN LIFTING FOR SHE WOULD LET NO ONE BE FETCHED TO HELP HER FROM THE VILLAGE NOT BEING FOND OF FEMALE NEIGHBOURS GENERALLY
SILLY PET
YOU'LL NEVER PERSUADE ME THAT I CAN'T TELL WHAT MEN ARE BY THEIR OUTSIDES
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE DOSES WHICH A MAN MAY ADMINISTER TO HIMSELF BY KEEPING UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES BEFORE HIS MIND
HOW PRETTY THE LITTLE PUSS LOOKS IN THAT ODD DRESS
WHY YOU'D LEAVE THE DIRT IN HEAPS I THE CORNERS--ANYBODY UD THINK YOU'D NEVER BEEN BROUGHT UP AMONG CHRISTIANS
I KNOW YOU ARE FOND OF QUEER WIZARDLIKE STORIES
BUT I WANT TO CALL AT THE HALL FARM ON MY WAY TO LOOK AT THE WHELPS POYSER IS KEEPING FOR ME YOU MUST STAY AND HAVE LUNCH FIRST ARTHUR SAID MRS IRWINE
FOR THERE IS NO HOUR THAT HAS NOT ITS BIRTHS OF GLADNESS AND DESPAIR NO MORNING BRIGHTNESS THAT DOES NOT BRING NEW SICKNESS TO DESOLATION AS WELL AS NEW FORCES TO GENIUS AND LOVE
BUT THE SMILE WAS LIKE WINE TO ADAM
I COULDN'T HAVE BORE TO LOOK AT ANYBODY FOR THEY'D HAVE SCORNED ME
IT'S BEEN GEV HOUT AS A YOUNG WOMAN'S A-GOING TO PREACH ON THE GREEN ANSWERED MR CASSON IN A TREBLE AND WHEEZY VOICE WITH A SLIGHTLY MINCING ACCENT
IT WAS TO CONFESS WHAT HAD BEEN UNJUST IN HIS OWN WORDS
BUT THEE KNOW'ST THYSELF AS IT'S HEARING THE PREACHERS THEE FIND'ST SO MUCH FAULT WITH HAS TURNED MANY AN IDLE FELLOW INTO AN INDUSTRIOUS UN
BUT EH
IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MRS POYSER YES SIR
AN HERE THEY'N GI'EN YOU LOTS O GOOD GROGRAM AND FLANNEL AS SHOULD HA BEEN GI'EN BY GOOD RIGHTS TO THEM AS HAD THE SENSE TO KEEP AWAY FROM SUCH FOOLERY
THEE MUN FORGIE THY FEYTHER--THEE MUNNA BE SO BITTER AGAIN HIM
AND THIS MORNING IT WAS INTENT ON SCHEMES BY WHICH THE ROADS MIGHT BE IMPROVED THAT WERE SO IMPERFECT ALL THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND ON PICTURING ALL THE BENEFITS THAT MIGHT COME FROM THE EXERTIONS OF A SINGLE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN IF HE WOULD SET HIMSELF TO GETTING THE ROADS MADE GOOD IN HIS OWN DISTRICT
SHE LOOKED INTO IT SMILING AND TURNING HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE FOR A MINUTE THEN LAID IT DOWN AND TOOK OUT HER BRUSH AND COMB FROM AN UPPER DRAWER
THERE WAS THE SAME SORT OF ANTITHETIC MIXTURE IN MARTIN POYSER
THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE EQUALLY CONTENT WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT
NOT AS YOU'D BE LIKE A POOR MAN AS WANTS TO GET HIS BREAD--YOU COULD AFFORD TO LOSE AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU LIKED I FARMING--BUT IT'S POOR FUN LOSING MONEY I SHOULD THINK THOUGH I UNDERSTAN IT'S WHAT THE GREAT FOLKS I LONDON PLAY AT MORE THAN ANYTHING
NO MAN CAN ESCAPE THIS VITIATING EFFECT OF AN OFFENCE AGAINST HIS OWN SENTIMENT OF RIGHT AND THE EFFECT WAS THE STRONGER IN ARTHUR BECAUSE OF THAT VERY NEED OF SELF-RESPECT WHICH WHILE HIS CONSCIENCE WAS STILL AT EASE WAS ONE OF HIS BEST SAFEGUARDS
WHAT A FRIEND HE WOULD BE TO GO TO IN TROUBLE
THE MONEY AS IS GOT SO'S LIKE TO BURN HOLES I YOUR POCKET
HE'S AN UNCOMMON CLEVER STIDDY FELLOW AN WONDERFUL STRONG
THE LYRICISM OF THE EVENING WAS IN THE CELLAR AT PRESENT AND WAS NOT TO BE DRAWN FROM THAT RETREAT JUST YET
AND ADAM WHO HAD BEEN LONGING TO GO EVER SINCE HE HAD HEARD DINAH WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE ROSE AND SAID HE MUST BID GOOD-NIGHT
BUT WHAT AT ANOTHER TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN INTOLERABLE TO LISBETH'S HABITS OF ORDER AND CLEANLINESS SEEMED TO HER NOW JUST WHAT SHOULD BE
NO GRAND COMPANY WAS COME EXCEPT THE IRWINES FOR WHOM THE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN SENT EARLY AND ARTHUR WAS AT THAT MOMENT NOT IN A BACK ROOM BUT WALKING WITH THE RECTOR INTO THE BROAD STONE CLOISTERS OF THE OLD ABBEY WHERE THE LONG TABLES WERE LAID FOR ALL THE COTTAGE TENANTS AND THE FARM-SERVANTS
BUT IS THAT AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT GOD
SHE THOUGHT OF ALL SHE HAD LEFT BEHIND WITH YEARNING REGRET FOR HER OWN SAKE
GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND HAVE SOME ALE POOR OLD THIAS SAID MR IRWINE WHEN JOSHUA WAS GONE
NO SOONER HAD THIS LITTLE PLAN SHAPED ITSELF IN HIS MIND THAN HE BEGAN TO BE BUSY WITH EXACT CALCULATIONS ABOUT THE WOOD TO BE BOUGHT AND THE PARTICULAR ARTICLE OF FURNITURE THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN FIRST--A KITCHEN CUPBOARD OF HIS OWN CONTRIVANCE WITH SUCH AN INGENIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF SLIDING-DOORS AND BOLTS SUCH CONVENIENT NOOKS FOR STOWING HOUSEHOLD PROVENDER AND SUCH A SYMMETRICAL RESULT TO THE EYE THAT EVERY GOOD HOUSEWIFE WOULD BE IN RAPTURES WITH IT AND FALL THROUGH ALL THE GRADATIONS OF MELANCHOLY LONGING TILL HER HUSBAND PROMISED TO BUY IT FOR HER
BUT TO WALK BY DINAH'S SIDE AND BE TYRANNIZED OVER BY DINAH'S AND ADAM'S CHILDREN WAS UNCLE SETH'S EARTHLY HAPPINESS
HAST GOT TROUBLES O THY OWN LIKE OTHER FOLKS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL THERE WERE THE TWO BROTHERS SO LIKE EACH OTHER IN THE MIDST OF THEIR UNLIKENESS
BUT IT IS A TRIAL--THE FLESH IS WEAK ADAM SAW THAT IT PAINED HER TO BE OBLIGED TO ANSWER
IT WAS NOT AFTER ALL A THING TO MAKE A FUSS ABOUT
HIS OWN APPROBATION WAS NECESSARY TO HIM AND IT WAS NOT AN APPROBATION TO BE ENJOYED QUITE GRATUITOUSLY
JUST RIDE SLOWLY ON IRWINE SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE MOUNTING ALSO
DINAH LOOKED AS IF SHE DID NOT SEE ADAM AND FIXED HER EYES ON SETH'S FACE SAYING WITH CALM KINDNESS I WON'T SAY FAREWELL
AND IF YOU HAD EVER LIVED IN MRS POYSER'S HOUSEHOLD YOU WOULD KNOW HOW THE DUSTER BEHAVED IN DINAH'S HAND--HOW IT WENT INTO EVERY SMALL CORNER AND ON EVERY LEDGE IN AND OUT OF SIGHT--HOW IT WENT AGAIN AND AGAIN ROUND EVERY BAR OF THE CHAIRS AND EVERY LEG AND UNDER AND OVER EVERYTHING THAT LAY ON THE TABLE TILL IT CAME TO ADAM'S PAPERS AND RULERS AND THE OPEN DESK NEAR THEM
I DON'T LIKE HIM SHE SAID HASTILY AND THE TEARS OF VEXATION HAD COME SO FAST THAT BEFORE SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING A BRIGHT DROP ROLLED DOWN HER HOT CHEEK
MARTY WAS QUITE SURE HE SAW A YELLOW-HAMMER ON THE BOUGHS OF THE GREAT ASH AND WHILE HE WAS PEEPING HE MISSED THE SIGHT OF A WHITE-THROATED STOAT WHICH HAD RUN ACROSS THE PATH AND WAS DESCRIBED WITH MUCH FERVOUR BY THE JUNIOR TOMMY
FOR HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOR EVER
I WISH SHE HAD A SURER TRUST TO COMFORT HER IN HER OLD AGE ADAM'S SURE ENOUGH SAID MR POYSER MISUNDERSTANDING DINAH'S WISH
THAT TOUCH OF MELANCHOLY CAME FROM QUITE ANOTHER SOURCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO KNOW
THAT MAY BE WRONG AND I AM TO BE TAUGHT BETTER
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CART GOES TOWARD ASHBY IN THE MORNING YES THERE MAY BE CARTS IF ANYBODY KNOWED WHERE THEY STARTED FROM
I DON'T BELIEVE YOUR LOVING ME COULD SHUT UP YOUR HEART--IT'S ONLY ADDING TO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN BEFORE NOT TAKING AWAY FROM IT
HE LINGERED A MOMENT LOOKING AT HER AND THEN TURNED AWAY AND LEFT THE ROOM TREADING VERY GENTLY--HE HAD TAKEN OFF HIS BOOTS AND PUT ON SLIPPERS BEFORE HE CAME UPSTAIRS
THEE'T FONDER ON HER NOR THEE KNOW'ST
ADAM WAS NOT A MAN TO BE GRATUITOUSLY SUPERSTITIOUS BUT HE HAD THE BLOOD OF THE PEASANT IN HIM AS WELL AS OF THE ARTISAN AND A PEASANT CAN NO MORE HELP BELIEVING IN A TRADITIONAL SUPERSTITION THAN A HORSE CAN HELP TREMBLING WHEN HE SEES A CAMEL
IT WAS THE BROWN-AND-YELLOW PLATTER CONTAINING THE BAKED POTATOES WITH THE GRAVY IN THEM AND BITS OF MEAT WHICH SHE HAD CUT AND MIXED AMONG THEM
SHE PUT IT TO HER LIPS AND A RUSH OF REMEMBERED SENSATIONS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO SWEPT AWAY ALL FEAR
OH WHAT A LARGE WORLD IT WAS AND WHAT HARD WORK FOR HER TO FIND HER WAY IN IT
IF THE CAPTAIN WAS MASTER O TH ESTATE IT UD BE DIFFERENT
AND IT GAVE ME STRENGTH AND RESOLUTION TO GET UP AND DRESS MYSELF
COME LISBETH COME WITH MOTHER THE LAST CALL WAS ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY BY A SMALL FAIR CREATURE WITH PALE AUBURN HAIR AND GREY EYES LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD WHO RAN OUT SILENTLY AND PUT HER HAND INTO HER MOTHER'S
AND TO GIVE HER UP AFTER ALL AS HE WAS DETERMINED TO DO WOULD BE AN ACT THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK BACK UPON WITH PRIDE
IT WAS NO USE TO THINK OF DROWNING HERSELF--SHE COULD NOT DO IT AT LEAST WHILE SHE HAD MONEY LEFT TO BUY FOOD AND STRENGTH TO JOURNEY ON
HER LIFE WAS UNHOLY
SHE HAD NO PRESENCE OF MIND LEFT FOR THE REFLECTION THAT ARTHUR WOULD HAVE HIS REASONS FOR NOT TELLING THE TRUTH TO ADAM
BUT I WAS ENCOURAGED TO THINK SHE LOVED ME AND--YOU KNOW THE REST SIR
GIVE BARTLE MASSEY HIS WAY AND HE'D HAVE ALL THE SHARPNESS TO HIMSELF
SHE WALKED THROUGH FIELD AFTER FIELD AND NO VILLAGE NO HOUSE WAS IN SIGHT
AND THE MILD LOVING EYES TOOK AN EXPRESSION OF APPALLED PITY AS IF SHE HAD SUDDENLY DISCERNED A DESTROYING ANGEL HOVERING OVER THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE
IT WAS THE FIRST SIGHT OF THE CROWD AND THE JUDGE POOR CREATUR
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT IT SAID BARTLE
I'M NO GOOD TO NOBODY NOW ADAM NEVER TOOK NOTICE OF HIS MOTHER'S LITTLE UNJUST PLAINTS
SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW LONG THEY SAT IN THAT WAY BUT IT GOT DARKER AND DARKER TILL THERE WAS ONLY A PALE PATCH OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL
SHE WAS ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ADAM AND COULD SEE HIM SOONER THAN OTHER FOLKS FOR ALL HER EYES GOT DIM HE'S BEEN LONGER THAN HE EXPECTED SAID DINAH TAKING ARTHUR'S WATCH FROM A SMALL SIDE POCKET AND LOOKING AT IT
AS FOR THE YOUNG CHICKENS AND TURKEYS HETTY WOULD HAVE HATED THE VERY WORD HATCHING IF HER AUNT HAD NOT BRIBED HER TO ATTEND TO THE YOUNG POULTRY BY PROMISING HER THE PROCEEDS OF ONE OUT OF EVERY BROOD
CHAPTER VIII A VOCATION DINAH WHO HAD RISEN WHEN THE GENTLEMEN CAME IN BUT STILL KEPT HOLD OF THE SHEET SHE WAS MENDING CURTSIED RESPECTFULLY WHEN SHE SAW MR IRWINE LOOKING AT HER AND ADVANCING TOWARDS HER
YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ME ADAM HE SAID IN THAT LOW CONSTRAINEDLY QUIET TONE WHICH A MAN USES WHEN HE IS DETERMINED TO SUPPRESS AGITATION
WHEN ONE END O TH BRIDGE TUMBLES DOWN WHERE'S TH USE O TH OTHER STANNIN
AND THOSE PUPS--WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M TO DO WITH EM WHEN THEY'RE TWICE AS BIG AS YOU
AND DO YOU CARRY THE BUTTER TO MARKET WHEN YOU'VE MADE IT SAID THE CAPTAIN TO HETTY MEANWHILE
DON'T YOU SEE AS MR IRWINE DOES THAT IF THEY COULD BE PERSUADED TO OVERCOME THE FEELING THAT DRIVES THEM AWAY IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR THEM IN THE END TO REMAIN ON THE OLD SPOT AMONG THE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WHO KNOW THEM THAT'S TRUE SAID ADAM COLDLY
ADDY LIKES A RIDE ON MY SHOULDER
SHE ISNA FOND O SETH I RECKON IS SHE
THE THOUGHT OF THIS HOVEL BROUGHT THE ENERGY OF A NEW HOPE
IT'S ONE O THEM SUBJECTS THAT LEAD YOU FURTHER THAN Y EXPECT--THEY DON'T LIE ALONG THE STRAIGHT ROAD THEY WALKED ALONG TOGETHER IN SILENCE TWO OR THREE MINUTES
THAT IS THE LONGING WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING THROUGH THE LAST THREE HOURS TO A FEVERISH THIRST
AND I NEVER KISSED HER I MY LIFE--BUT I'D HA WORKED HARD FOR YEARS FOR THE RIGHT TO KISS HER
I'M AN OLD FELLOW AND IT'S A GOOD MANY YEARS SINCE I WAS IN TROUBLE MYSELF
WHILE LISBETH WOULD ASK HIM HOW HE SUPPOSED THE COFFIN HAD BEEN GOT READY THAT HE HAD SLINKED OFF AND LEFT UNDONE--FOR LISBETH WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO UTTER THE WORD OF REPROACH ALTHOUGH SHE CRIED AT ADAM'S SEVERITY TOWARDS HIS FATHER
SHE LOOKED WITH EAGER HUNGRY EYES AT THE BREAD AND MEAT AND BEER THAT THE LANDLADY BROUGHT HER AND FOR SOME MINUTES SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE DELICIOUS SENSATIONS OF SATISFYING HUNGER AND RECOVERING FROM EXHAUSTION
PAINTING TO THEM THE DESOLATION OF THEIR SOULS LOST IN SIN FEEDING ON THE HUSKS OF THIS MISERABLE WORLD FAR AWAY FROM GOD THEIR FATHER
AGAIN HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE ARM THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BUT VERY GENTLY THIS TIME AS HE SAID SOLEMNLY
IT WAS BUT ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF TO BROXTON OVER THE OPPOSITE SLOPE AND THEIR ROAD WOUND VERY PLEASANTLY ALONG LANES AND ACROSS FIELDS WHERE THE PALE WOODBINES AND THE DOG-ROSES WERE SCENTING THE HEDGEROWS AND THE BIRDS WERE TWITTERING AND TRILLING IN THE TALL LEAFY BOUGHS OF OAK AND ELM
IT'S A SORE FAULT IN ME AS I'M SO HOT AND OUT O PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO WRONG AND MY HEART GETS SHUT UP AGAINST EM SO AS I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO FORGIVE EM
IT'S THE YOUNG METHODIST WOMAN COME FROM THE PRISON
WE MAY DETERMINE NOT TO GATHER ANY CHERRIES AND KEEP OUR HANDS STURDILY IN OUR POCKETS BUT WE CAN'T PREVENT OUR MOUTHS FROM WATERING THAT'S TRUE SIR BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE SETTLING WITH OURSELVES AS THERE'S A DEAL WE MUST DO WITHOUT I THIS LIFE
SHE KNEW THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF EVERY PAGE AND COULD TELL ON WHAT BOOK SHE OPENED SOMETIMES ON WHAT CHAPTER WITHOUT SEEING TITLE OR NUMBER
BUT I WAS SO TIRED AND IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS DARK
BUT IT WAS NOT AT ALL A DISTRESSED BLUSH FOR IT WAS INWREATHED WITH SMILES AND DIMPLES AND WITH SPARKLES FROM UNDER LONG CURLED DARK EYELASHES
FALSEHOOD IS SO EASY TRUTH SO DIFFICULT
IT'S A PITY BUT WHAT THE BITS WAS STACKED UP FOR YOU TO SEE THOUGH IT'S NEITHER SEEING NOR HEARING AS ULL MAKE MUCH ODDS TO YOU--ANYBODY UD THINK YOU WAR CASE-HARDENED POOR MOLLY'S TEARS WERE DROPPING FAST BY THIS TIME AND IN HER DESPERATION AT THE LIVELY MOVEMENT OF THE BEER-STREAM TOWARDS ALICK'S LEGS SHE WAS CONVERTING HER APRON INTO A MOP WHILE MRS POYSER OPENING THE CUPBOARD TURNED A BLIGHTING EYE UPON HER
THIS WAS WHAT DINAH HAD BEEN TRYING TO BRING ABOUT THROUGH ALL HER STILL SYMPATHY AND ABSENCE FROM EXHORTATION
BUT HE'D BE A FINE HUSBAND FOR ANYBODY BE THEY WHO THEY WILL SO LOOKED-ON AN SO CLIVER AS HE IS
BUT WHAT SIGNIFIED A BARREN PATCH OR TWO
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN LIVE WI'OUT EATIN AN NOURISH YOUR INSIDE WI STICKIN RED RIBBONS ON YOUR HEAD
HIS RESPECT AND AFFECTION COULD NOT BE RECOVERED BY ANY PROMPT DEEDS OF ATONEMENT
IT'S EASY TALKING FOR THEM AS CAN'T LOVE HER SO WELL AS HER OWN AUNT DOES
AH WHAT A PRIZE THE MAN GETS WHO WINS A SWEET BRIDE LIKE HETTY
FOR HE HAD SEEMED QUITE CONTENTED OF LATE AND THERE WAS NO SELFISH JEALOUSY IN HIM
CAST THEM AWAY FROM YOU AS IF THEY WERE STINGING ADDERS
HE LOOKS TERRIBLY SHATTERED AND A CERTAIN VIOLENCE CAME OVER HIM NOW AND THEN YESTERDAY WHICH MADE ME WISH I COULD HAVE REMAINED NEAR HIM
FOR I SAID WHO CAN TELL WHETHER GOD WILL BE GRACIOUS TO ME THAT THE CHILD MAY LIVE
SHE WAS STANDING IN THE SAME POSITION BARTLE MASSEY HAD DESCRIBED HER HANDS CROSSED OVER EACH OTHER AND HER EYES FIXED ON THEM
SHE'S TEACHING ME TENT-STITCH AND THE LACE-MENDING
ELSE WHY SHOULDN'T THEM AS KNOW BEST WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE--THE PARSONS AND PEOPLE AS HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO BUT LEARN IT--DO THE SAME AS YOU DO
THOUGH SHE'LL DO NOTHING WITH IT BUT NOURISH THOSE UNNECESSARY BABBIES
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE DARK PENETRATING GLANCE OF THIS STRONG MAN SO DIFFERENT FROM THE MILDNESS AND TIMIDITY OF HIS BROTHER SETH
CHAPTER IX HETTY'S WORLD WHILE SHE ADJUSTED THE BROAD LEAVES THAT SET OFF THE PALE FRAGRANT BUTTER AS THE PRIMROSE IS SET OFF BY ITS NEST OF GREEN I AM AFRAID HETTY WAS THINKING A GREAT DEAL MORE OF THE LOOKS CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE HAD CAST AT HER THAN OF ADAM AND HIS TROUBLES
AND YET HOW HARD SHE WOULD THINK IT IF HE ASKED HER TO LEAVE HIM
HE COULD ONLY FEEL WITH A TERRIBLE PANG THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HETTY'S LIFE UNKNOWN TO HIM
HE'S A GOOD WAY BEYOND SIXTY YOU KNOW
IT WAS A DREAD TO WHICH SHE FELT CHAINED FROM WHICH SHE SHRANK AND SHRANK AS SHE DID FROM THE BLACK POOL AND YET COULD FIND NO REFUGE FROM IT
FOR SAID HE THERE'S NO DANGER OF ANYBODY'S BREAKING IN--EVERYBODY'LL BE AT THE CHASE THIEVES AN ALL
IT IS OUR HABIT TO SAY THAT WHILE THE LOWER NATURE CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND THE HIGHER THE HIGHER NATURE COMMANDS A COMPLETE VIEW OF THE LOWER
FOR MY POOR UNCLE WAS TOO MUCH WEIGHED DOWN WITH TROUBLE TO REMEMBER CLOSE BY HERE
SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS LIKE A BEGGAR ALREADY--FOUND SLEEPING IN THAT PLACE
THAT IS TO SAY THE LOWER SPHERE MIGHT BE SAID AT A ROUGH GUESS TO BE THIRTEEN TIMES LARGER THAN THE UPPER WHICH NATURALLY PERFORMED THE FUNCTION OF A MERE SATELLITE AND TRIBUTARY
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY
IF IT'S ONLY LAYING A FLOOR DOWN SOMEBODY'S THE BETTER FOR IT BEING DONE WELL BESIDES THE MAN AS DOES IT THEY WERE BOTH GLAD TO TALK OF SUBJECTS THAT WERE NOT PERSONAL AND IN THIS WAY THEY WENT ON TILL THEY PASSED THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE WILLOW BROOK WHEN ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID AH HERE'S SETH
DINAH PUT HER EAR TO THE PARTITION AND HEARD STILL SOME SLIGHT NOISES WHICH CONVINCED HER THAT HETTY WAS NOT YET IN BED
AND THEN THE TERROR OF WANDERING OUT INTO THE WORLD OF WHICH SHE KNEW NOTHING MADE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING TO ARTHUR A THOUGHT WHICH BROUGHT SOME COMFORT WITH IT
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO BOX BESSY'S EARS AND YOU WOULD HAVE LONGED TO KISS HETTY
THAT WAS THE UTMOST SEVERITY HE COULD SHOW TOWARDS HIS MOTHER ON A SUNDAY MORNING
MOLLY SHE SAID RATHER LANGUIDLY JUST RUN OUT AND GET ME A BUNCH OF DOCK-LEAVES
HE HAD NOT THE LEAST OBJECTION TO GRATIFY THEM IN THAT WAY
BUT I THOUGHT I COULD PICK A HOLE OR TWO IN THEIR NOTIONS AND I GOT DISPUTING WI ONE O THE CLASS LEADERS DOWN AT TREDDLES'ON AND HARASSED HIM SO FIRST O THIS SIDE AND THEN O THAT TILL AT LAST HE SAID YOUNG MAN IT'S THE DEVIL MAKING USE O YOUR PRIDE AND CONCEIT AS A WEAPON TO WAR AGAINST THE SIMPLICITY O THE TRUTH I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING THEN BUT AS I WAS GOING HOME I THOUGHT THE MAN WASN'T FAR WRONG
MEANTIME MR IRWINE TURNED ROUND HIS CHAIR AND SAID WELL JOSHUA ANYTHING THE MATTER AT HAYSLOPE THAT YOU'VE COME OVER THIS DAMP MORNING
THIS YOUNG OLIVE-BRANCH NOTORIOUS UNDER THE NAME OF TIMOTHY'S BESS'S BEN BEING OF AN INQUIRING DISPOSITION UNCHECKED BY ANY FALSE MODESTY HAD ADVANCED BEYOND THE GROUP OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND WAS WALKING ROUND THE METHODISTS LOOKING UP IN THEIR FACES WITH HIS MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BEATING HIS STICK AGAINST THE MILK-CAN BY WAY OF MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT
TO BE SURE WE CAN'T HELP KNOWING SOMETHING ABOUT GOD EVEN IF WE'VE NEVER HEARD THE GOSPEL THE GOOD NEWS THAT OUR SAVIOUR BROUGHT US
IT WAS A WOOD OF BEECHES AND LIMES WITH HERE AND THERE A LIGHT SILVER-STEMMED BIRCH--JUST THE SORT OF WOOD MOST HAUNTED BY THE NYMPHS
BUT DINAH'S WORDS UTTERED WITH SOLEMN PATHETIC DISTINCTNESS AFFECTED HER WITH A CHILL FEAR
I SUPPOSE CARROLL HAS TOLD YOU THAT DONNITHORNE WAS FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED THIS MORNING
BUT THEN IT UD BE HARDER FOR A MAN WITH HIS FEELINGS TO STAY
IT HAD THAT QUIET ELASTICITY THAT ASKS FOR NO SUPPORT
YOU'D MAKE ME THE SAME ANSWER AT TH END
I'LL MA HIM A KETTLE-CAKE FOR BREAKFAST I THE MORNIN ADAM MEANWHILE WAS READING DINAH'S LETTER BY THE LIGHT OF HIS DIP CANDLE
DO YOU WANT PROVOKING ANY MORE
THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU--THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
HE WON'T TAKE IT ILL THEN I DARESAY AND I'M WILLING HE SAID THIS WITH SOME EFFORT FOR HE REALLY LONGED TO BE NEAR HETTY THIS EVENING
HE CAN MAKE HER WHAT HE LIKES--THAT IS PLAIN
IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HER TO READ A GENTLEMAN'S HANDWRITING THOUGH ARTHUR HAD TAKEN PAINS TO WRITE PLAINLY
BUT PERHAPS HE HAD BETTER NOT TAKE ANY MORE NOTICE OF HER
THAT UD BE THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM FOR IT UD GIVE HIM PLENTY TO DO AND HE'D DO'T WELL TOO FOR ALL HE'S SO YOUNG
AND THE THOUGHT THAT THE EYES OF HER AUNT AND UNCLE WOULD BE UPON HER GAVE HER THE SELF-COMMAND WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES A GREAT DREAD
DINAH HE THOUGHT HAD SEEMED TO DISAPPROVE HIM SOMEHOW LATELY
BUT SHE SHRANK FROM THAT IDEA AGAIN AS SHE MIGHT HAVE SHRUNK FROM SCORCHING METAL
HE WAS AMAZED HIMSELF AT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THIS TRIVIAL FANCY SEEMED TO GRASP HIM
THE THOUGHT OF DINAH'S PALE GRAVE FACE AND MILD GREY EYES WHICH THE SIGHT OF THE GOWN AND CAP BROUGHT WITH IT MADE IT A LAUGHABLE SURPRISE ENOUGH TO SEE THEM REPLACED BY HETTY'S ROUND ROSY CHEEKS AND COQUETTISH DARK EYES
BUT...YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY TO HIM YOU KNOW
IT'S ALL READY--AND YOU'LL HAVE A CUP ADAM IF Y ARENA IN TOO BIG A HURRY YES I'LL HAVE A CUP PLEASE
BUT THE WENCH TAKES ARTER HER MOTHER
ALL BUT MARTIN POYSER--POOR MARTIN
TH METHODIES LL NIVER MAKE THEE HALF THE MAN THY BROTHER IS FOR ALL THEY'RE A-MAKIN A PREACHER ON THEE IT'S PARTLY TRUTH THEE SPEAK'ST THERE MOTHER SAID SETH MILDLY
THEE WOULDSTNA HA M GO TO THE WORKHUS--THY OWN FEYTHER--AN HIM AS WAS A FINE-GROWED MAN AN HANDY AT EVERYTHIN AMOST AS THEE ART THYSEN FIVE-AN'-TWENTY EAR AGO WHEN THEE WAST A BABY AT THE BREAST LISBETH'S VOICE BECAME LOUDER AND CHOKED WITH SOBS--A SORT OF WAIL THE MOST IRRITATING OF ALL SOUNDS WHERE REAL SORROWS ARE TO BE BORNE AND REAL WORK TO BE DONE
MR IRWINE DIDN'T GO INTO THOSE THINGS--HE PREACHED SHORT MORAL SERMONS AND THAT WAS ALL
AND SHE HAS BEEN TELLING ME WHAT ADAM HAS DONE FOR THESE MANY YEARS TO HELP HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHER
YOU KNOW GAWAINE HAS GOT THE CURSES OF THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD UPON HIM ABOUT THAT ENCLOSURE
THEIR EYES WERE JUST OF THE SAME COLOUR BUT A STRIKING TEST OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR OPERATION WAS SEEN IN THE DEMEANOUR OF TRIP THE BLACK-AND-TAN TERRIER WHENEVER THAT MUCH-SUSPECTED DOG UNWARILY EXPOSED HIMSELF TO THE FREEZING ARCTIC RAY OF MRS POYSER'S GLANCE
WHATIVER DO YOU MEAN BY COMING DOWN I THAT WAY AND MAKING ONE THINK AS THERE'S A GHOST A-WALKING I TH HOUSE A NEW OUTBREAK OF LAUGHTER WHILE MRS POYSER WAS SPEAKING WAS CAUSED LESS BY HER SUDDEN CONVERSION TO A FATALISTIC VIEW OF JUG-BREAKING THAN BY THAT STRANGE APPEARANCE OF HETTY WHICH HAD STARTLED HER AUNT
IT'S A DAY THEY WONNA SEE TWICE I THEIR LIVES BUT MRS POYSER ANSWERED WITH GREAT DECISION
SHE DOESNA WANT TO MARRY HIM
IN THIS STATE OF MIND THE FOUR WALLS OF HIS ROOM MADE AN INTOLERABLE PRISON TO HIM
I ONLY WANT A DRINK FOR MY HORSE
LISBETH SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE CHAIR OPPOSITE TO HIM AS SHE SAID
HE THOUGHT OF THROWING A LITTLE GLAZED COLDNESS INTO HIS EYE IN THE CROSSING OF HANDS
BUT THE SCHOOL-MASTER WAS SO ACTIVE WITH HIS LAMENESS THAT IT WAS HARDLY THOUGHT OF AS A MISFORTUNE
I COULD HA CARRIED IT WITH BOTH HANDS OH I DARESAY SAID ADAM SMILING AND BEEN AS LONG GETTING INTO THE HOUSE AS A LITTLE ANT CARRYING A CATERPILLAR
THERE HE IS SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR
BUT SHE'S A-VISITIN HEREABOUT AT MESTER POYSER'S AT THE HALL FARM--IT'S THEM BARNS AN BIG WALNUT-TREES RIGHT AWAY TO THE LEFT SIR
IT UD BE A DEAL BETTER FOR US EH WHAT'S THE USE O TALKING O TIDY BODIES WHEN THEE MEAN'ST ONE O TH WENCHES OUT O TH VILLAGE OR SOMEBODY FROM TREDDLES'ON AS I NE'ER SET EYES ON I MY LIFE
YOU MAY GO THE COUNTRY ROUND AND NOT FIND SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN TURNED SIXTY-SIX
HETTY LIFTED HER LONG DEWY LASHES AND MET THE EYES THAT WERE BENT TOWARDS HER WITH A SWEET TIMID BESEECHING LOOK
WHAT'S TO MAKE ME SURE AS THE HOUSE WON'T BE PUT O BOARD WAGE AFORE WE'RE MANY MONTHS OLDER AND THEN I MAY HAVE TO LIE AWAKE O NIGHTS WI TWENTY GALLONS O MILK ON MY MIND--AND DINGALL ULL TAKE NO MORE BUTTER LET ALONE PAYING FOR IT
HE HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO TELL A LIE
BUT MY HEART IS NOT FREE TO MARRY
IS DINAH MORRIS AT HOME SAID ADAM
BUT HETTY SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING FOR SHE GOT UP AND REACHED AN OLD BLACK LACE SCARF OUT OF THE LINEN-PRESS AND A PAIR OF LARGE EAR-RINGS OUT OF THE SACRED DRAWER FROM WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN HER CANDLES
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CONDUCT THAT POYSER WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IF HE HAD KNOWN IT WHY NO MAN'S CONDUCT WILL BEAR TOO CLOSE AN INSPECTION
WELL WELL SAID MR POYSER AT LAST WE NEEDNA FIX EVERYTHING TO-NIGHT
SOME OF THE WOMEN WHISPERED THAT HE DIDN'T SHOW HIMSELF THANKFUL ENOUGH AND SEEMED TO SPEAK AS PROUD AS COULD BE
THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
BUT THERE WAS ONE REASON WHY EVEN A CHANCE COMER WOULD HAVE FOUND THE SERVICE IN HAYSLOPE CHURCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN IN MOST OTHER VILLAGE NOOKS IN THE KINGDOM--A REASON OF WHICH I AM SURE YOU HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION
AND WHAT HAS SETH GOT TO DO WITH IT
SHE'S JUST THE WOMAN FOR THEE IT'S NO USE THINKING O THAT SAID SETH DESPONDINGLY
BUT WHEN HE KNEW IT WAS DEAD HE ROSE UP FROM THE GROUND AND WASHED AND ANOINTED HIMSELF AND CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND ATE AND DRANK
I'LL STAND IF YOU PLEASE AS MORE BECOMING
I BELONG TO RESPECTABLE FOLKS SHE SAID
I FELT AS IF NOBODY PITIED HER ENOUGH--HER SUFFERING CUT INTO ME SO
ADAM WITH KNIT BROWS SHAGGY HAIR AND DARK VIGOROUS COLOUR ABSORBED IN HIS FIGURING
I DIDN'T FASTEN THE DOOR BEHIND ME
BUT TOTTY ONLY CRIED LOUDER AND SAID DON'T YOCK SO THE MOTHER WITH THAT WONDROUS PATIENCE WHICH LOVE GIVES TO THE QUICKEST TEMPERAMENT SAT UP AGAIN AND PRESSED HER CHEEK AGAINST THE LINEN NIGHT-CAP AND KISSED IT AND FORGOT TO SCOLD HETTY ANY LONGER
WELL WELL VIXEN YOU FOOLISH WENCH WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT
MOTHER HE SAID IN A REMONSTRATING TONE DON'T THINK THAT OF ME
FOR THOSE CHILDREN OF GOD WHOM IT HAS BEEN GRANTED TO SEE EACH OTHER FACE TO FACE AND TO HOLD COMMUNION TOGETHER AND TO FEEL THE SAME SPIRIT WORKING IN BOTH CAN NEVER MORE BE SUNDERED THOUGH THE HILLS MAY LIE BETWEEN
AND I KNOW THAT SHE HAD LONGED FOR EAR-RINGS FROM AMONG ALL THE ORNAMENTS SHE COULD IMAGINE
SET ABOUT THY FEYTHER'S COFFIN NO MOTHER SAID ADAM
THAT WOULD BE A PITY
IT'S WELL KNOWN I'M NOT GIVING OTHER FOLKS THINGS AWAY FOR WHEN I'VE SUPPLIED THE HOUSE THE GARDEN'S MY OWN SPEKILATION AND IT ISNA EVERY MAN TH OLD SQUIRE COULD GET AS UD BE EQUIL TO THE UNDERTAKING LET ALONE ASKING WHETHER HE'D BE WILLING I'VE GOT TO RUN MY CALKILATION FINE I CAN TELL YOU TO MAKE SURE O GETTING BACK THE MONEY AS I PAY THE SQUIRE
THOUGH I'M AFRAID BY THE BY THE SMOKED GLASS IS APT TO BE MISSING JUST AT THE MOMENT IT IS MOST WANTED
HER GREAT DARK EYES WITH THEIR LONG EYE-LASHES TOUCH ONE SO STRANGELY AS IF AN IMPRISONED FRISKY SPRITE LOOKED OUT OF THEM
ADAM TOO HAD COME FROM STONTION ON MONDAY EVENING AND TO-DAY HE HAD NOT LEFT HOME EXCEPT TO GO TO THE FAMILY AT THE HALL FARM AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING THAT MR IRWINE HAD LEFT UNTOLD
DON'T YOU KNOW ME HETTY
BUT HAD HE SEEN ANYTHING OF WHAT THEIR MOTHER TALKED ABOUT
IT'S NO USE LOOKING ON LIFE AS IF IT WAS TREDDLES'ON FAIR WHERE FOLKS ONLY GO TO SEE SHOWS AND GET FAIRINGS
AND IT WAS SO TO-NIGHT WITH ADAM
AND I ENVY YOU YOUR CHICKENS
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF IRREGULAR JUSTICE ON MRS POYSER'S PART BUT A MAGISTRATE LIKE ME MUST NOT COUNTENANCE IRREGULAR JUSTICE
THAT PALE LOOK CAME UPON ARTHUR LIKE THE BEGINNING OF A DULL PAIN WHICH CLUNG TO HIM THOUGH HE MUST DANCE AND SMILE AND JOKE ALL THE SAME
AN I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THE POOR THING SETTLED LIKE A CHRISTIAN WOMAN WITH A HOUSE OF HER OWN OVER HER HEAD
I FEAR I SHOULD FORGET TO REJOICE AND WEEP WITH OTHERS
IT WAS QUITE TIME HETTY CAME HOME AND HE WOULD AFFORD TO LOSE HIS MONDAY FOR THE SAKE OF BRINGING HER
IF IT HAD BEEN ONLY GOING TO DINAH--IF NOBODY BESIDES DINAH WOULD EVER KNOW--HETTY COULD HAVE MADE UP HER MIND TO GO TO HER
SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT FROM HIS SILENCE AND GRAVITY AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED WITH HER THAT HE WAS INCLINED TO BE HARSH AND SEVERE TOWARDS HER FOIBLES
SHE SAT SOBBING TILL THE CANDLE WENT OUT AND THEN WEARIED ACHING STUPEFIED WITH CRYING THREW HERSELF ON THE BED WITHOUT UNDRESSING AND WENT TO SLEEP
THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE NOT QUITE SO STUPID AS YOU IMAGINE
SO THE TWELVE O'CLOCK SUN SAW HIM GALLOPING TOWARDS NORBURNE
HE'S NO HEART FOR IT YET AND IT'S BETTER FOR OTHERS THAT HE SHOULD KEEP AWAY
TELL HER I FORGIVE HER
IT WAS A SHORT BIT OF WAX CANDLE THAT STOOD AMONGST A CONFUSION OF WRITING AND DRAWING MATERIALS
SHE OPENED HER TREASURE-DRAWER
AND ADAM'S IMAGINATION SAW A DIMPLED FACE WITH DARK BRIGHT EYES AND ROGUISH SMILES LOOKING BACKWARD AT THIS BRUSH AND A ROUNDED FIGURE JUST LEANING A LITTLE TO CLASP THE HANDLE
WELL DAUPHIN MRS IRWINE SAID AS HER SON ENTERED HER ROOM YOU'RE COME AT LAST
WELL THEN MY PET MOTHER'S GOT HER MOTHER WON'T LEAVE HER
MY LOCKET MY LOCKET SHE SAID IN A LOUD FRIGHTENED WHISPER TO ADAM
IT WAS A PITY THEY WERE NOT IN THAT GOLDEN AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE STOOD FACE TO FACE EYEING EACH OTHER WITH TIMID LIKING THEN GIVEN EACH OTHER A LITTLE BUTTERFLY KISS AND TODDLED OFF TO PLAY TOGETHER
OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE FELL UNDER THE IMMEDIATE OBSERVATION OF MR CASSON WHO TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE QUESTION OF PRECEDENCE HAD NOT HITHERTO NOTICED HIS ENTRANCE
INDEED SHE HAS NOT YET RECOVERED HER EQUANIMITY ON THE SUBJECT THOUGH IT IS NOW NEARLY THREE HOURS SINCE DINNER AND THE HOUSE-FLOOR IS PERFECTLY CLEAN AGAIN
HE WAS NEVER ON HORSEBACK IN HIS LIFE EXCEPT ONCE WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE LAD AND MR JONATHAN BURGE TOOK HIM UP BEHIND TELLING HIM TO HOLD ON TIGHT
BUT IN HER LONG SOLITARY HOURS SHE BROODED OVER HER REGRETFUL THOUGHTS ABOUT DINAH TILL THEY HAD GROWN VERY NEAR THAT POINT OF UNMANAGEABLE STRENGTH WHEN THOUGHTS ARE APT TO TAKE WING OUT OF THEIR SECRET NEST IN A STARTLING MANNER
HER BROAD CHEST IS COVERED WITH A BUFF NECKERCHIEF AND BELOW THIS YOU SEE A SORT OF SHORT BEDGOWN MADE OF BLUE-CHECKERED LINEN TIED ROUND THE WAIST AND DESCENDING TO THE HIPS FROM WHENCE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF LINSEY-WOOLSEY PETTICOAT
AN THE LADS ULL BE MARRYIN'--I SHALL HA DAUGHTERS ENO AN TOO MANY
I'M QUITE WILLING YOU SHOULD GO AND SEE TH OLD WOMAN FOR YOU'RE ONE AS IS ALLAYS WELCOME IN TROUBLE METHODIST OR NO METHODIST
AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO REPRESENT THEIR DICTION AS CORRECT OR THEIR INSTRUCTION AS LIBERAL
HE LIVED CHIEFLY IN THE COUNTRY AMONG PLEASANT SEATS AND HOMESTEADS AND WAS FOND OF SAUNTERING BY THE FRUIT-TREE WALL AND SCENTING THE APRICOTS WHEN THEY WERE WARMED BY THE MORNING SUNSHINE OR OF SHELTERING HIMSELF UNDER THE ORCHARD BOUGHS AT NOON WHEN THE SUMMER PEARS WERE FALLING
YOU LOOK VERY HAPPY TO-NIGHT DEAR CHILD SHE SAID
THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY PREACHING SIR AND I'VE PREACHED EVER SINCE DINAH HAD LET HER WORK FALL DURING THIS NARRATIVE WHICH SHE UTTERED IN HER USUAL SIMPLE WAY BUT WITH THAT SINCERE ARTICULATE THRILLING TREBLE BY WHICH SHE ALWAYS MASTERED HER AUDIENCE
BUT YOU'VE NOT GOT MANY METHODISTS ABOUT HERE SURELY--IN THIS AGRICULTURAL SPOT
FOR GYP'S EXCITEMENT WAS TOO GREAT TO FIND VENT IN ANYTHING SHORT OF A SHARP BARK AND IN A MOMENT ADAM OPENED HIS EYES AND SAW HIS MOTHER STANDING BEFORE HIM
I THOUGHT THEE'DST BE AT HOME BEFORE ME HE SAID AS SETH TURNED ROUND TO WAIT FOR HIM FOR I'M LATER THAN USUAL TO-NIGHT WELL I'M LATER TOO FOR I GOT INTO TALK AFTER MEETING WITH JOHN BARNES WHO HAS LATELY PROFESSED HIMSELF IN A STATE OF PERFECTION AND I'D A QUESTION TO ASK HIM ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
BUT IT'S LITTLE MATTER WHAT OTHER WOMEN THINK ABOUT ME IF SHE CAN'T LOVE ME
PERHAPS I WAS MAKING TOO FREE
FOR THERE WERE NO CANDLES--WHY SHOULD THERE BE WHEN THE FIRE WAS SO BRIGHT AND WAS REFLECTED FROM ALL THE PEWTER AND THE POLISHED OAK
ONE OLD COAT ULL DO TO PATCH ANOTHER BUT IT'S GOOD FOR NOUGHT ELSE
BUT HE HAS RATHER GRASPING FINGERS OF HIS OWN I FANCY
THE ONLY WAY TO BRING HIM ROUND WOULD BE TO SHOW HIM WHAT WAS FOR HIS OWN INTEREST AND THAT THE CAPTAIN MAY DO--THAT THE CAPTAIN MAY DO NAY I DON'T KNOW SAID ADAM
WHATEVER DINAH MIGHT SAY SHE ALMOST ALWAYS STROKED HETTY'S CHEEK AFTER IT AND WANTED TO DO SOME MENDING FOR HER
I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF MY LITTLE HETTY SHEDDING TEARS WHEN I AM NOT THERE TO KISS THEM AWAY
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN MR IRWINE SAID I DON'T LIKE TO ADVISE YOU AGAINST YOUR OWN FEELINGS ADAM IF THEY NOW URGE YOU STRONGLY TO GO AND SEE HER TO-MORROW MORNING EVEN WITHOUT HER CONSENT
DEAR FRIENDS SHE SAID IN A CLEAR BUT NOT LOUD VOICE LET US PRAY FOR A BLESSING SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND HANGING HER HEAD DOWN A LITTLE CONTINUED IN THE SAME MODERATE TONE AS IF SPEAKING TO SOME ONE QUITE NEAR HER
I'LL STICK UP FOR THE PRETTY WOMEN PREACHIN
BUT SHE NOT AWARE OF THE CONSOLATION IN STORE FOR HER TURNED OUT OF THE OPEN SPACE WHERE SHE WAS VISIBLE FROM THE MARQUEE AND THROWING DOWN THE ODIOUS BUNDLE UNDER A TREE BEGAN TO CRY--VERY MUCH TITTERED AT THE WHILE BY THE SMALL BOYS
AN HOW DID YOU LEAVE THE OLD WOMAN BEDE DINAH
THOSE ARE THE CLOTHES
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S A MAN'S PLAIN DUTY AND NOTHING TO BE CONCEITED ABOUT AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME AS I'VE NEVER DONE MORE THAN MY DUTY
HE FELT THERE WAS SOME TERRIBLE SECRET UNDER ALL THIS
SHE'S BEEN GONE SIN FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT
THERE YOU GO RESUMED MRS POYSER IN A CUTTING TONE AS SHE ROSE AND WENT TOWARDS THE CUPBOARD WHILE MOLLY BEGAN DOLEFULLY TO PICK UP THE FRAGMENTS OF POTTERY
I HURT YOU BY TALKING ABOUT IT DINAH HE SAID
HARDLY THIS LITTLE GLASSFUL WELL GIVE ME THAT SAID ARTHUR WITH THE PEEVISHNESS OF PHYSICAL DEPRESSION
WHY ADAM I'M GLAD TO GET SIGHT ON Y AGAIN SAID MR POYSER WHO WAS CARRYING TOTTY ON HIS ARM
IT WOULD BE BETTER HIDDEN THAN ONE IN THE FIELDS
MEANTIME THE MEN LINGERED OUTSIDE AND HARDLY ANY OF THEM EXCEPT THE SINGERS WHO HAD A HUMMING AND FRAGMENTARY REHEARSAL TO GO THROUGH ENTERED THE CHURCH UNTIL MR IRWINE WAS IN THE DESK
SO THE MOTHER AND SON KNELT DOWN TOGETHER AND SETH PRAYED FOR THE POOR WANDERING FATHER AND FOR THOSE WHO WERE SORROWING FOR HIM AT HOME
FOR WE SHOULD BE O ONE HEART AND O ONE MIND DINAH
MAYHAP THE BEST THING I EVER DID IN MY LIFE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS EASIEST FOR MYSELF
BUT HETTY HAD ANOTHER PASSION ONLY A LITTLE LESS STRONG THAN HER LOVE OF FINERY AND THAT OTHER PASSION MADE HER LIKE TO WEAR THE LOCKET EVEN HIDDEN IN HER BOSOM
YOUR FINE CRITIC OF WOMAN MUST NEVER SHACKLE HIS JUDGMENT BY CALLING ONE WOMAN HIS OWN
MUSTNA SHE ADAM
AN THEE'ST HAD THE FETCHIN ON HER TIMES ENOW THEE MEAN'ST DINAH MOTHER I KNOW SAID ADAM
FOR SEE
THE VERY DEER FELT IT AND WERE MORE TIMID
HE FELT SURE SHE KNEW QUITE WELL ENOUGH HOW MUCH HE CARED TO SEE HER CONTINUALLY--TO TALK TO HER WITH THE SILENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF A MUTUAL GREAT REMEMBRANCE
SHE LOOKS LIKE A RESPECTABLE COUNTRY GIRL AND SHE COMES FROM A GOOD WAY OFF TO JUDGE BY HER TONGUE
MR AND MRS POYSER YOU PERCEIVE HAD NO CORRECT PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION
OH MESTER MASSEY SITS UP LATE SAID ADAM
YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHAT CAUSE I HAVE TO PUT YOU ABOVE EVERY OTHER FRIEND I'VE GOT
DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED
BETTER RUN AWAY BEFORE THAN REPENT AFTER
AND AS FOR THOSE TIRESOME CHILDREN MARTY AND TOMMY AND TOTTY THEY HAD BEEN THE VERY NUISANCE OF HER LIFE--AS BAD AS BUZZING INSECTS THAT WILL COME TEASING YOU ON A HOT DAY WHEN YOU WANT TO BE QUIET
IT'S POOR KEEPIN COMPANY WI FOLKS AS DONNA LIKE TO SEE THEE I THY WORKIN JACKET GOOD-BYE MOTHER I CAN'T STAY SAID ADAM PUTTING ON HIS HAT AND GOING OUT
IT HARDLY BECOMES SO YOUNG A MAN AS I AM TO TALK MUCH ABOUT FARMING TO YOU WHO ARE MOST OF YOU SO MUCH OLDER AND ARE MEN OF EXPERIENCE
WELL SAID SETH AFTER SOME HESITATION IT'S CROSSED MY MIND SOMETIMES O LATE AS SHE MIGHT
DO YOU HEAR YES I HEAR I HEAR CAP'N SAID OLD JOHN VERY DELIBERATELY FOLLOWING THE YOUNG MASTER INTO THE STABLE
AND IF YOU WOULD MAINTAIN THE SLIGHTEST BELIEF IN HUMAN HEROISM YOU MUST NEVER MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO SEE THE HERO
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WIND--THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE WIND
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS
THAT LIFE I HAVE LED IS LIKE A LAND I HAVE TRODDEN IN BLESSEDNESS SINCE MY CHILDHOOD
IT WAS THAT MOMENT IN SUMMER WHEN THE SOUND OF THE SCYTHE BEING WHETTED MAKES US CAST MORE LINGERING LOOKS AT THE FLOWER-SPRINKLED TRESSES OF THE MEADOWS
MRS POYSER WAS QUITE AGREEABLY SURPRISED THAT HETTY WISHED TO GO AND SEE DINAH AND TRY TO BRING HER BACK TO STAY OVER THE WEDDING
SO THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S FIDGETINESS AND LOW SPIRITS WHICH MADE HIM SEND FOR ARTHUR IN THAT SUDDEN WAY REALLY MEANT SOMETHING
I CAN UNDERSTAN THE TEX AS HE'S ALLAYS A-SAYIN GOD HELPS THEM AS HELPS THEIRSENS NAY MOTHER SAID SETH THAT'S NO TEXT O THE BIBLE
SHE SAID SHE SHOULDN'T LEAVE THE FARM AGAIN TO-DAY SAID SETH BECAUSE IT'S HER LAST SABBATH THERE AND SHE'S GOING T READ OUT O THE BIG BIBLE WI THE CHILDREN ADAM THOUGHT--BUT DID NOT SAY--"THEN I'LL GO THIS AFTERNOON
I'M NOT THIS COUNTRYMAN YOU MAY TELL BY MY TONGUE SIR
DON'T YOU REMEMBER DINAH
IN OLD AGE THEIR WHITE HAIRS ARE SEEN IN A PLACE OF HONOUR AT CHURCH AND AT MARKET AND THEY TELL THEIR WELL-DRESSED SONS AND DAUGHTERS SEATED ROUND THE BRIGHT HEARTH ON WINTER EVENINGS HOW PLEASED THEY WERE WHEN THEY FIRST EARNED THEIR TWOPENCE A-DAY
HE TOLD ME TO GIVE HIS RESPECTS TO YOU AND YOUR GOOD MASTER AYE THE SAME T HIM
I HARDLY KNOW HOW FOR I HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HIM AS A WORLDLY SADDUCEE
AND THE OLD CARVED OAKEN PRESS TABLE AND CHAIRS WHICH IN THESE DAYS WOULD BE BOUGHT AT A HIGH PRICE IN ARISTOCRATIC HOUSES THOUGH IN THAT PERIOD OF SPIDER-LEGS AND INLAID CUPIDS BARTLE HAD GOT THEM FOR AN OLD SONG WHERE AS FREE FROM DUST AS THINGS COULD BE AT THE END OF A SUMMER'S DAY
IT IS TOO POSSIBLE THAT TO SOME OF MY READERS METHODISM MAY MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN LOW-PITCHED GABLES UP DINGY STREETS SLEEK GROCERS SPONGING PREACHERS AND HYPOCRITICAL JARGON--ELEMENTS WHICH ARE REGARDED AS AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS OF METHODISM IN MANY FASHIONABLE QUARTERS
I DARESAY YOU KNOW THE BEDES
I CAN COME BACK AT NOON AND THEN HE CAN GO NAY NAY PERSISTED LISBETH BEGINNING TO CRY I'N SET MY HEART ON'T AS THEE SHALT MA THY FEYTHER'S COFFIN
IT GAVE HIM NEW FORCE
BUT I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT A STRANGER
BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
YET WITH THOSE PARCHED LIPS HE PRAYS FOR THEM FATHER FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO THEN A HORROR OF GREAT DARKNESS FELL UPON HIM AND HE FELT WHAT SINNERS FEEL WHEN THEY ARE FOR EVER SHUT OUT FROM GOD
IN OUR INSTINCTIVE REBELLION AGAINST PAIN WE ARE CHILDREN AGAIN AND DEMAND AN ACTIVE WILL TO WREAK OUR VENGEANCE ON
IT WAS WROTE BY A KNOWING MAN BUT OVERWORLDLY I DOUBT
BUT I KNOW BETTER NOR THAT
AND SHE BEGAN NOW TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE SCHEME BY WHICH SHE SHOULD GET AWAY
MOSTLY SALLET I RECKON AND SAYS I TO MILLS CONTINUED MR CRAIG WILL YOU TRY TO MAKE ME BELIEVE AS FURRINERS LIKE THEM CAN DO US HALF TH HARM THEM MINISTERS DO WITH THEIR BAD GOVERNMENT
AND THE MERE FACT THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF AN INTIMATE FRIEND WHO HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTION THAT HE HAD HAD ANY SUCH SERIOUS INTERNAL STRUGGLE AS HE CAME TO CONFIDE RATHER SHOOK HIS OWN BELIEF IN THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE STRUGGLE
SUCH A WOMAN AS LISBETH FOR EXAMPLE--AT ONCE PATIENT AND COMPLAINING SELF-RENOUNCING AND EXACTING BROODING THE LIVELONG DAY OVER WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AND WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN TO-MORROW AND CRYING VERY READILY BOTH AT THE GOOD AND THE EVIL
REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS AFTER YOU HAD GIVEN THAT BLOW TO ARTHUR IN THE GROVE ADAM WAS SILENT
ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM
AND FEELING THAT IT BECAME HIM AS A MAN AND A COACHMAN TO OPEN THE DIALOGUE WITH A JOKE HE APPLIED HIMSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE OFF THE STONES TO THE ELABORATION OF ONE SUITABLE IN ALL RESPECTS
THE PASSIONATE JOY IN LIFE SHE HAD FELT IN THE NIGHT AFTER ESCAPING FROM THE BRINK OF THE BLACK COLD DEATH IN THE POOL WAS GONE NOW
THEN SHE DREW FORTH A BUNDLE OF MATCHES AND LIGHTED THE CANDLES
BUT OCCASIONALLY SINCE THURSDAY EVENING HER DIM ANXIETIES HAD BEEN ALMOST LOST BEHIND THE MORE DEFINITE FEAR THAT ADAM MIGHT BETRAY WHAT HE KNEW TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT AND HIS SUDDEN PROPOSITION TO TALK WITH HER ALONE HAD SET HER THOUGHTS TO WORK IN A NEW WAY
BUT FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS A NEW INFLUENCE HAD COME OVER HETTY--VAGUE ATMOSPHERIC SHAPING ITSELF INTO NO SELF-CONFESSED HOPES OR PROSPECTS BUT PRODUCING A PLEASANT NARCOTIC EFFECT MAKING HER TREAD THE GROUND AND GO ABOUT HER WORK IN A SORT OF DREAM UNCONSCIOUS OF WEIGHT OR EFFORT AND SHOWING HER ALL THINGS THROUGH A SOFT LIQUID VEIL AS IF SHE WERE LIVING NOT IN THIS SOLID WORLD OF BRICK AND STONE BUT IN A BEATIFIED WORLD SUCH AS THE SUN LIGHTS UP FOR US IN THE WATERS
ADAM MY BOY THE BLOW FALLS HEAVILY ON HIM AS WELL AS YOU
I LIKE THE NEEDLEWORK SAID HETTY AND I SHOULD GET GOOD WAGES HAS YOUR AUNT BEEN A BIT SHARP WI YOU SAID MR POYSER NOT NOTICING HETTY'S FURTHER ARGUMENT
SHE FELT SURE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE PASSING THE PEW DOOR BUT THE HOUSE-KEEPER'S BLACK BONNET AND THE LADY'S MAID'S BEAUTIFUL STRAW HAT THAT HAD ONCE BEEN MISS LYDIA'S AND THEN THE POWDERED HEADS OF THE BUTLER AND FOOTMAN
MEETING HETTY WAS A MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS WALK NOT ITS OBJECT
I BELIEVE HER THOUGHTS ARE BETTER THAN OUR GUESSES LET EM BE WHAT THEY MAY
HE IS GOING TO SEE HETTY AGAIN
WOULD HE MEET HER AGAIN AS SHE CAME HOME
AND I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND MR ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IN FEELING THAT WHEN A MAN WHOSE DUTY LIES IN THAT SORT OF WORK SHOWS A CHARACTER WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM AN EXAMPLE IN ANY STATION HIS MERIT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED
HETTY THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO MARRY MARY BURGE--SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM TO MARRY--PERHAPS SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM TO MARRY ANY ONE BUT HERSELF
WE ARE OF ONE MIND IN THAT YES DINAH SAID ADAM SADLY I'LL NEVER BE THE MAN T URGE YOU AGAINST YOUR CONSCIENCE
STILL THERE WAS THIS ADVANTAGE IN THE OLD RIGID FORMS THAT THEY COMMITTED YOU TO THE FULFILMENT OF A RESOLUTION BY SOME OUTWARD DEED
I CLEAN FORGOT TO TAKE EM OFF THE OLD MAN MADE THIS TRIVIAL REMARK THINKING IT BETTER NOT TO RESPOND AT ALL TO ADAM'S AGITATION
DID YOU EVER SEE IT NO SIR THIS IS THE WALK WHERE WE TURN UP TO IT
AND I WENT TO WHERE THE LITTLE FLOCK OF PEOPLE WAS GATHERED TOGETHER AND STEPPED ON THE LOW WALL THAT WAS BUILT AGAINST THE GREEN HILLSIDE AND I SPOKE THE WORDS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ME ABUNDANTLY
THIS GIVES YOU A SORT OF SMOKED GLASS THROUGH WHICH YOU MAY LOOK AT THE RESPLENDENT FAIR ONE AND DISCERN HER TRUE OUTLINE
ADAM HIMSELF WATCHED HER AT FIRST WITH TREMBLING ANXIETY WHICH GAVE WAY TO SURPRISE AND DELICIOUS HOPE
HE COULDN'T STAY HERE IN WRETCHED INACTION
BUT NO SOONER DID ADAM PUT HIS RULER IN HIS POCKET AND BEGIN TO TWIST HIS APRON ROUND HIS WAIST THAN GYP RAN FORWARD AND LOOKED UP IN HIS MASTER'S FACE WITH PATIENT EXPECTATION
THE MISSIS WAS SAYING ADAM AS THE PREACHING WAS THE ONLY FAULT TO BE FOUND WI DINAH AND MR IRWINE SAYS BUT YOU MUSTN'T FIND FAULT WITH HER FOR THAT MRS POYSER
FOR IT APPEARED THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS QUITE VOLUNTARY
LET US GO ADAM ASSENTED SILENTLY
ADAM HAD ON HIS WORKING-DRESS AGAIN NOW FOR HE HAD THROWN OFF THE OTHER WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF AS SOON AS HE CAME HOME
I DAREDN'T GO BACK HOME AGAIN--I COULDN'T BEAR IT
I ALWAYS HAVE A FAVOURITE BOOK BY ME AT BREAKFAST AND I ENJOY THE BITS I PICK UP THEN SO MUCH THAT REGULARLY EVERY MORNING IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I SHOULD CERTAINLY BECOME STUDIOUS AGAIN
WHILE THE CHILD WAS YET ALIVE HE FASTED AND PRAYED TO GOD TO SPARE IT AND HE WOULD NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK BUT LAY ON THE GROUND ALL NIGHT BESEECHING GOD FOR THE CHILD
HE WOULD BE READY THEN TO ACT AS MY GRAND-VIZIER WHEN I WANTED ONE
I MUST GET ON YOUR SERVANT SIR
YOU SEE HOW BLOOMING MY MOTHER LOOKS
BUT THE SCENT OF THE STABLES WHICH IN A NATURAL STATE OF THINGS OUGHT TO BE AMONG THE SOOTHING INFLUENCES OF A MAN'S LIFE ALWAYS BROUGHT WITH IT SOME IRRITATION TO ARTHUR
BUT NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF MENTIONING THE MISS IRWINES EXCEPT THE POOR PEOPLE IN BROXTON VILLAGE WHO REGARDED THEM AS DEEP IN THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE AND SPOKE OF THEM VAGUELY AS THE GENTLEFOLKS IF ANY ONE HAD ASKED OLD JOB DUMMILOW WHO GAVE HIM HIS FLANNEL JACKET HE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED THE GENTLEFOLKS LAST WINTER
SHE TOOK IT WITH AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AND PUT IT IN HER POCKET IN HER HEART VEXED AND ANGRY WITH ADAM BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN IT BUT DETERMINED NOW THAT SHE WOULD SHOW NO MORE SIGNS OF AGITATION
AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I MUST WRESTLE AGAINST THAT AS A GREAT TEMPTATION AND THE COMMAND WAS CLEAR THAT I MUST GO AWAY BUT NOW DEAR DEAR DINAH NOW YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BETTER THAN YOU LOVE ME...IT'S ALL DIFFERENT NOW
FOR DEAR HETTY IF I WERE TO DO WHAT YOU ONE DAY SPOKE OF AND MAKE YOU MY WIFE I SHOULD DO WHAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD COME TO FEEL WAS FOR YOUR MISERY INSTEAD OF YOUR WELFARE
SHE'S GOIN AWAY TWENTY MILE AFF
NO SHE WAS NOT TO BE TRACED ANY FARTHER
HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER THE MILK ULL BE WANTED CONSTANT
HE HAD LONG MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE WRONG AS WELL AS FOOLISH FOR HIM TO MARRY A BLOOMING YOUNG GIRL SO LONG AS HE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THAT OF GROWING POVERTY WITH A GROWING FAMILY
HE WOULD SURELY NOT BE ANGRY WITH HER
THERE ARE HETTY'S FRIENDS THE GOOD POYSERS ON WHOM THIS STROKE WILL FALL MORE HEAVILY THAN I CAN BEAR TO THINK
I'LL TAKE A MOUTHFUL O OAT-CAKE AND THEN WE'LL BE OFF THE COFFIN WAS SOON PROPPED ON THE TALL SHOULDERS OF THE TWO BROTHERS AND THEY WERE MAKING THEIR WAY FOLLOWED CLOSE BY GYP OUT OF THE LITTLE WOODYARD INTO THE LANE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE
THE LIGHT FOOTSTEP MOVED ABOUT THE KITCHEN FOLLOWED BY THE SOUND OF THE SWEEPING BRUSH HARDLY MAKING SO MUCH NOISE AS THE LIGHTEST BREEZE THAT CHASES THE AUTUMN LEAVES ALONG THE DUSTY PATH
THOSE ARE THINGS AS YOU CAN'T BOTTLE UP IN A DO THIS AND DO THAT
SLOWLY LISBETH DREW DOWN HER APRON AND TIMIDLY SHE OPENED HER DIM DARK EYES
AT LAST THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE FOURTH DANCE--LONGED FOR BY THE STRONG GRAVE ADAM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A DELICATE-HANDED YOUTH OF EIGHTEEN
I KNEW I COULDN'T RUN AWAY AND EVERYBODY AS SAW ME UD KNOW ABOUT THE BABY
AND MY GRANDFATHER WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO PART WITH SUCH GOOD TENANTS AS YOU WELL SIR IF HE THINKS SO WELL O MR POYSER FOR A TENANT I WISH YOU COULD PUT IN A WORD FOR HIM TO ALLOW US SOME NEW GATES FOR THE FIVE CLOSES FOR MY HUSBAND'S BEEN ASKING AND ASKING TILL HE'S TIRED AND TO THINK O WHAT HE'S DONE FOR THE FARM AND'S NEVER HAD A PENNY ALLOWED HIM BE THE TIMES BAD OR GOOD
WELL THEN DAVID YE'RE THE LAD TO SING SAID BEN WILLING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT DISCOMFITED BY THIS CHECK
AYE IT'S ILL LIVIN IN A HEN-ROOST FOR THEM AS DOESN'T LIKE FLEAS SAID MRS POYSER
SO NEVER COME TO ME AGAIN IF YOU CAN'T SHOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR OWN HEADS INSTEAD OF THINKING THAT YOU CAN PAY FOR MINE TO WORK FOR YOU
I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM
A MAN MUST HAVE COURAGE TO LOOK AT HIS LIFE SO AND THINK WHAT'LL COME OF IT AFTER HE'S DEAD AND GONE
THEE MUN SET ABOUT IT NOW THIS MORNIN FUST THING
I CAN'T HA HAD HER ABOUT ME THESE SEVEN YEAR I RECKON AND DONE FOR HER AND TAUGHT HER EVERYTHING WI'OUT CARING ABOUT HER
THERE WERE THE LOCKET AND EAR-RINGS IN THE LITTLE VELVET-LINED BOXES AND WITH THEM THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL SILVER THIMBLE WHICH ADAM HAD BOUGHT HER THE WORDS REMEMBER ME MAKING THE ORNAMENT OF THE BORDER
THIS WAS WHAT THE OMEN MEANT THEN
HER AUNT MRS POYSER WHO PROFESSED TO DESPISE ALL PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS AND INTENDED TO BE THE SEVEREST OF MENTORS CONTINUALLY GAZED AT HETTY'S CHARMS BY THE SLY FASCINATED IN SPITE OF HERSELF
SHE DID NOT CARE WHAT SHE DID SO THAT IT MADE SOME CHANGE IN HER LIFE
THERE'D BEEN NOTHING SAID BETWEEN ME AND HETTY THEN THOUGH I'D LOVED HER FOR A LONG WHILE AND SHE KNEW IT
SHE WAS NOT PREACHING AS SHE HEARD OTHERS PREACH BUT SPEAKING DIRECTLY FROM HER OWN EMOTIONS AND UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF HER OWN SIMPLE FAITH
I'M ONLY GOING TO SPEAK TO THE SHEPHERD ABOUT THE WHELPS
I'VE NOT SEEN HER MYSELF WELL I WISH I HAD TIME TO WAIT AND SEE HER BUT I MUST GET ON
I THOUGHT SHE HAD A STRANGE LOOK WITH HER EYES AND SHE GOT A BIT FLUSHED TOWARDS EVENING
HER AUNT'S SCOLDING ABOUT TRIFLES WOULD HAVE BEEN MUSIC TO HER EARS NOW
WHY WHERE IS IT DOWN IN EVER SUCH A HOLE UNDER THE HEDGE
DEAREST HETTY--I HAVE SPOKEN TRULY WHEN I HAVE SAID THAT I LOVED YOU AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET OUR LOVE
THE EYEBROWS OF THE SAME COLOUR AS THE HAIR WERE PERFECTLY HORIZONTAL AND FIRMLY PENCILLED
THEE'ST GOT TOO MUCH GRISTLE I THY BONES YET
HETTY GOT INTO AN ILL TEMPER WITH IT ALMOST EVERY TIME SHE DRESSED
LET IT ALONE OR I'LL SHAKE THE SOUL OUT O YOUR BODY BEN SHOOK IN ADAM'S IRON GRASP BUT LIKE A PLUCKY SMALL MAN AS HE WAS HE DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE IN
BUT THEY MAY WELL HAVE MORE IN THEM THAN THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE US UNDERSTAND FOR WE CAN'T SAY HALF WHAT WE FEEL WITH ALL OUR WORDS SETH CAME DOWN NOW AND WAS PLEASED TO FIND ADAM TALKING WITH DINAH
NOT A NEW UNSEASONED JOKE BUT A GOOD OLD ONE THAT HAD BEEN TRIED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND HAD WORN WELL
SHE BEATS US YOUNGER PEOPLE HOLLOW
WHEN HE ENTERED A READING LESSON WAS GOING FORWARD AND BARTLE MASSEY MERELY NODDED LEAVING HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE WHERE HE PLEASED
AS SOON AS YOU'VE BASTED ONE ANOTHER'S BURNIN HETTY STOOD SUFFICIENTLY IN AWE OF HER AUNT TO BE ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL FROM HER SO MUCH OF HER VANITY AS COULD BE HIDDEN WITHOUT TOO GREAT A SACRIFICE
BUT NO TEMPTATION WOULD HAVE INDUCED HIM TO CARRY ON ANY FIELD-WORK HOWEVER EARLY IN THE MORNING ON A SUNDAY
IT WOULDNA HA BEEN GOOD FOR YOU IF HE'D WANTED TO DO SUCH A MAD THING AS MARRY YOU
WAS HE ONLY A GOOD MAN--A VERY GOOD MAN AND NO MORE--LIKE OUR DEAR MR WESLEY WHO HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM US?...HE WAS THE SON OF GOD--'IN THE IMAGE OF THE FATHER THE BIBLE SAYS
AND YOU'VE A RIGHT TO FEEL THAT AND NOT TO GO ABOUT AS GAPING AND AS THOUGHTLESS AS IF YOU WAS BEHOLDING TO NOBODY
SHE FELT CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD STILL WANT TO MARRY HER AND ANY FURTHER THOUGHT ABOUT ADAM'S HAPPINESS IN THE MATTER HAD NEVER YET VISITED HER
OH THAT MUST NOT BE
NOW YOU SEE YOU DON'T DO THIS THING A BIT BETTER THAN YOU DID A FORTNIGHT AGO AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S THE REASON
THE SAME I ASSURE YOU ONLY UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS
AND YOU MUST MIND AND NOT LOWER THE CHURCH IN PEOPLE'S EYES BY SEEMING TO BE FRIGHTENED ABOUT IT FOR A LITTLE THING JOSHUA
BUT HE WENT ON WITH MORE HESITATION
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW QUIET SHE'S BEEN EVER SINCE I CAME BACK
IT IS IN THE NATURE OF INNKEEPERS AND ALL MEN WHO HAVE NO PRESSING BUSINESS OF THEIR OWN TO ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE GIVING ANY INFORMATION
THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMBER-CHOPPINGS PUT TOGETHER JUST WHERE THE GROUND WENT HOLLOW LIKE UNDER THE BUSH AND THE HAND CAME OUT FROM AMONG THEM
BURGE'S GETTING SO BAD WI HIS ASTHMY IT'S WELL IF HE'LL EVER DO MUCH RIDING ABOUT AGAIN YES WE'VE GOT A PRETTY BIT O BUILDING ON HAND NOW SAID ADAM WHAT WITH THE REPAIRS ON TH ESTATE AND THE NEW HOUSES AT TREDDLES'ON I'LL BET A PENNY THAT NEW HOUSE BURGE IS BUILDING ON HIS OWN BIT O LAND IS FOR HIM AND MARY TO GO TO SAID MR POYSER
BUT ADAM SAID SHE'D LEFT NO DIRECTION WHERE SHE'D BE AT LEEDS WHY SHE'D BE WI THAT WOMAN AS WAS A FRIEND T HER AUNT JUDITH SAID MRS POYSER COMFORTED A LITTLE BY THIS SUGGESTION OF HER HUSBANDS
DINAH MUST HAVE RISEN A LITTLE BEFORE THE SUN THE NEXT MORNING FOR SHE WAS DOWNSTAIRS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK
WE'RE ALL SERVED NOW AYE COME AN SIT YE DOWN--DO SAID LISBETH AN ATE A MORSEL
STRANGE THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM COMING
BUT SHE HAD NOT BEEN STANDING THERE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES BEFORE SHE CAME IN AGAIN AND SAID TO DINAH IN RATHER A FLURRIED AWE-STRICKEN TONE IF THERE ISN'T CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE AND MR IRWINE A-COMING INTO THE YARD
BUT BY AND BY THERE CAME A LIGHT STEP THAT HE KNEW AND WHEN MRS POYSER SAID COME HETTY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ADAM WAS OBLIGED TO TURN ROUND THOUGH HE WAS AFRAID TO SEE THE CHANGED LOOK THERE MUST BE IN HER FACE
BUT IT WAS BORNE IN UPON HER AS SHE AFTERWARDS SAID THAT SHE MUST NOT HURRY GOD'S WORK
THE EFFECT OF HER SPEECH WAS PRODUCED ENTIRELY BY THE INFLECTIONS OF HER VOICE AND WHEN SHE CAME TO THE QUESTION WILL GOD TAKE CARE OF US WHEN WE DIE SHE UTTERED IT IN SUCH A TONE OF PLAINTIVE APPEAL THAT THE TEARS CAME INTO SOME OF THE HARDEST EYES
WE CAN GO TO ADAM'S TOGETHER IF YOU LIKE
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY EVEN IN HIS ANGRIEST MOODS FOR ANY HARM TO HAPPEN TO HIS GRANDFATHER
SHE'S LOOKED LIKE IT O LATE EH THERE'S NO KNOWING WHAT SHE'S GOT A LIKING TO FOR THINGS TAKE NO MORE HOLD ON HER THAN IF SHE WAS A DRIED PEA
I MUST WAIT FOR CLEARER GUIDANCE
AND THAT'S WHY I MUST SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT HETTY FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD BE DECEIVING YOURSELF
THE TWO FIGURES WERE STANDING OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER WITH CLASPED HANDS ABOUT TO PART
AND THE THOUGHT CAME INTO MY MIND THAT I MIGHT GET RID OF IT AND GO HOME AGAIN
AND MY SOUL IS FILLED WITH THESE THINGS FROM MY RISING UP TILL MY LYING DOWN
NOTHING WAS THERE
I AM NOT TH ONLY MAN THAT'S GOT TO DO WITHOUT MUCH HAPPINESS I THIS LIFE
BUT IN THAT LONG INTERVAL DINAH HAD MADE GREAT ADVANCES IN HOUSEHOLD CLEVERNESS AND THIS MORNING SINCE SETH WAS THERE TO HELP SHE WAS BENT ON BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A PITCH OF CLEANLINESS AND ORDER THAT WOULD HAVE SATISFIED HER AUNT POYSER
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN FIXING HER HEART ON YOU FOR THERE'S A MANY THINGS CLEAR TO ME NOW AS I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BEFORE
IT'S ONLY WOMEN WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE AS LONG AS THAT WHEN THEY'VE GOT OLD-BACHELOR SONS WHO WOULD BE FORLORN WITHOUT THEM SAID MR IRWINE LAUGHING AND KISSING HIS MOTHER'S HAND
THE SOUND OF ANY MAN'S FOOTSTEP WOULD HAVE AFFECTED HER JUST IN THE SAME WAY--SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MIGHT BE ARTHUR BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO SEE AND THE BLOOD THAT FORSOOK HER CHEEK IN THE AGITATION OF THAT MOMENTARY FEELING WOULD HAVE RUSHED BACK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF ANY ONE ELSE JUST AS MUCH AS AT THE SIGHT OF ADAM
WHO'S TO LOOK AFTER EM THEN IF YOU'RE GONE
BUT HE'S GOT A TONGUE LIKE A SHARP BLADE BARTLE HAS--IT NEVER TOUCHES ANYTHING BUT IT CUTS
AND HE GAVE US OUR SOULS AND PUT LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN AND HUSBAND AND WIFE
I COULD SAY NOTHING TO HER YESTERDAY--NOTHING OF WHAT I FELT TOWARDS HER
I SAW HIS HAT AND HIS SHOULDER
IT WAS PAINFUL TO SEE HOW MUCH DUST THERE WAS AMONG THEM
AND THE DRESSING-TABLE WAS NO DRESSING-TABLE AT ALL BUT A SMALL OLD CHEST OF DRAWERS THE MOST AWKWARD THING IN THE WORLD TO SIT DOWN BEFORE FOR THE BIG BRASS HANDLES QUITE HURT HER KNEES AND SHE COULDN'T GET NEAR THE GLASS AT ALL COMFORTABLY
AN WHO IS IT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW AS YOU'RE BOUND T HELP AND COMFORT I THE WORLD MORE NOR YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD--AN ME TH ONLY AUNT YOU'VE GOT ABOVE-GROUND AN AM BROUGHT TO THE BRINK O THE GRAVE WELLY EVERY WINTER AS COMES AN THERE'S THE CHILD AS SITS BESIDE YOU ULL BREAK HER LITTLE HEART WHEN YOU GO AN THE GRANDFATHER NOT BEEN DEAD A TWELVEMONTH AN YOUR UNCLE ULL MISS YOU SO AS NEVER WAS--A-LIGHTING HIS PIPE AN WAITING ON HIM AN NOW I CAN TRUST YOU WI THE BUTTER AN HAVE HAD ALL THE TROUBLE O TEACHING YOU AND THERE'S ALL THE SEWING TO BE DONE AN I MUST HAVE A STRANGE GELL OUT O TREDDLES'ON TO DO IT--AN ALL BECAUSE YOU MUST GO BACK TO THAT BARE HEAP O STONES AS THE VERY CROWS FLY OVER AN WON'T STOP AT DEAR AUNT RACHEL SAID DINAH LOOKING UP IN MRS POYSER'S FACE IT'S YOUR KINDNESS MAKES YOU SAY I'M USEFUL TO YOU
THE REST WAS AD LIBITUM
HE HAD TOLD SETH TO GO TO THE CHASE AND LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE SQUIRE SAYING THAT ADAM BEDE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO START OFF SUDDENLY ON A JOURNEY--AND TO SAY AS MUCH AND NO MORE TO ANY ONE ELSE WHO MADE INQUIRIES ABOUT HIM
THEN SHE FELT ASHAMED TO DEATH THAT SHE WAS CRYING AND FOR ONE LONG INSTANT HER HAPPINESS WAS ALL GONE
IF YOU KNEW THINGS THAT PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW NOW DINAH LOOKED AT HIM INQUIRINGLY BUT INSTEAD OF GOING ON HE REACHED A CHAIR AND BROUGHT IT NEAR THE CORNER OF THE TABLE WHERE SHE WAS SITTING
BUT I DON'T SEE MYSELF WHAT WE WANT WI ANYBODY BESIDES KING AND PARLIAMENT
WHEN I WAS A GIRL I WAS MORE ADMIRED THAN IF I HAD BEEN SO VERY PRETTY
YET ARTHUR SAW AN ANSWER IN HIS FACE THAT INDUCED HIM TO GO ON WITH GROWING EARNESTNESS
YOU'D GO FRETTING YOURSELF TO DEATH IF I LEFT YOU--YOU KNOW YOU WOULD AND PERHAPS GET SNAPPED UP BY SOME TRAMP
BUT WHERE'S THE USE O TALKING IF YE WONNA BE PERSUADED AND SETTLE DOWN LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN IN HER SENSES I'STEAD O WEARING YOURSELF OUT WITH WALKING AND PREACHING AND GIVING AWAY EVERY PENNY YOU GET SO AS YOU'VE NOTHING SAVED AGAINST SICKNESS
EVEN A MOVEMENT OF JEALOUSY AT THE THOUGHT OF GIVING UP HETTY TO ADAM WENT TO CONVINCE HIM THAT HE WAS MAKING A SACRIFICE
I KNOW FORGIVENESS IS A MAN'S DUTY BUT TO MY THINKING THAT CAN ONLY MEAN AS YOU'RE TO GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS O TAKING REVENGE
IT MIGHT BE A BIT OF HER FATHER'S OR MOTHER'S WHO HAD DIED WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND SHE WOULD NATURALLY PUT A BIT OF HER OWN ALONG WITH IT
THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO STAND BEFORE GOD DRESSED IN YOUR SINS IN YOUR EVIL TEMPERS AND VAIN THOUGHTS
I LEAVE IT TO YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WILL BE DOING BEST TO DELIVER IT TO HETTY OR TO RETURN IT TO ME
NOW HE MUST TAKE HER HAND
SORROW IS THEN A PART OF LOVE AND LOVE DOES NOT SEEK TO THROW IT OFF
AND THEN I THOUGHT I'D GO HOME--I'D GET RIDES IN CARTS AND GO HOME AND TELL EM I'D BEEN TO TRY AND SEE FOR A PLACE AND COULDN'T GET ONE
YOU'RE RARE AND BUSY NOW--EH ADAM SAID MR POYSER
WE MUST GET YOU STRONG AND HEARTY HE SAID THAT'S THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE ARTHUR AND THEN YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP THE HOPE THAT YOU MAY COME TO SEE DIFFERENT
IT WAS REALLY QUITE AN IDYLLIC LOVE AFFAIR
AN I SHALL BE TOOK BAD AN DIE AN THEE CANST NE'ER COME A-NIGH ME AN I SHALL DIE A-LONGING FOR THEE THAT HAD BEEN THE KEY-NOTE OF HER WAILING TALK ALL DAY
THE NEXT MORNING SHE ROSE EARLY AND TAKING ONLY SOME MILK AND BREAD FOR HER BREAKFAST SET OUT TO WALK ON THE ROAD TOWARDS ASHBY UNDER A LEADEN-COLOURED SKY WITH A NARROWING STREAK OF YELLOW LIKE A DEPARTING HOPE ON THE EDGE OF THE HORIZON
I'VE BEEN AT THE HALL FARM AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE THEIR SUPPER BETIMES YOU KNOW
I AM AFRAID I HAVE OFTEN SMILED WITH HYPOCRITICAL ASSENT AND GRATIFIED THEM WITH AN EPIGRAM ON THE FLEETING NATURE OF OUR ILLUSIONS WHICH ANY ONE MODERATELY ACQUAINTED WITH FRENCH LITERATURE CAN COMMAND AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
SHE'S BEEN GONE TO LEEDS THIS FORTNIGHT AND I COULDN'T LEARN FROM TH OLD WOMAN ANY DIRECTION WHERE SHE IS AT LEEDS ELSE I SHOULD HA BROUGHT IT YOU SHE'D A DEAL BETTER BE STAYING WI HER OWN KIN SAID MR POYSER INDIGNANTLY THAN GOING PREACHING AMONG STRANGE FOLKS A-THAT'N I MUST LEAVE YOU NOW MR POYSER SAID ADAM FOR I'VE A DEAL TO SEE TO AYE YOU'D BEST BE AFTER YOUR BUSINESS AND I MUST TELL THE MISSIS WHEN I GO HOME
IT WAS WELL
SAY ANSWERED MRS POYSER WITH DANGEROUS FIRE KINDLING IN HER EYE
LET BE ADDY LET BE
AN HE MIGHT BE WILLIN TO MARRY HER IF HE KNOW'D SHE'S FOND ON HIM BUT HE'LL NE'ER THINK ON'T IF SOMEBODY DOESNA PUT IT INTO'S HEAD HIS MOTHER'S SUGGESTION ABOUT DINAH'S FEELING TOWARDS ADAM WAS NOT QUITE A NEW THOUGHT TO SETH BUT HER LAST WORDS ALARMED HIM LEST SHE SHOULD HERSELF UNDERTAKE TO OPEN ADAM'S EYES
IT'S WHAT RAG SHE CAN GET TO STICK ON HER AS SHE'S THINKING ON FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AS I OFTEN ASK HER IF SHE WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE THE MAWKIN I THE FIELD FOR THEN SHE'D BE MADE O RAGS INSIDE AND OUT
ARE YE COOM T HELP GROON
HETTY HOWEVER HAD NOT EVEN NOTICED HIS PRESENCE YET FOR SHE WAS GIVING ANGRY ATTENTION TO TOTTY WHO INSISTED ON DRAWING UP HER FEET ON TO THE BENCH IN ANTIQUE FASHION AND THEREBY THREATENED TO MAKE DUSTY MARKS ON HETTY'S PINK-AND-WHITE FROCK
FROM THIS LAST TROUBLE THE BROXTON AND HAYSLOPE FARMERS ON THEIR PLEASANT UPLANDS AND IN THEIR BROOK-WATERED VALLEYS HAD NOT SUFFERED AND AS I CANNOT PRETEND THAT THEY WERE SUCH EXCEPTIONAL FARMERS AS TO LOVE THE GENERAL GOOD BETTER THAN THEIR OWN YOU WILL INFER THAT THEY WERE NOT IN VERY LOW SPIRITS ABOUT THE RAPID RISE IN THE PRICE OF BREAD SO LONG AS THERE WAS HOPE OF GATHERING IN THEIR OWN CORN UNDAMAGED
ALL VERY OLD TRUTHS--BUT WHAT WE THOUGHT THE OLDEST TRUTH BECOMES THE MOST STARTLING TO US IN THE WEEK WHEN WE HAVE LOOKED ON THE DEAD FACE OF ONE WHO HAS MADE A PART OF OUR OWN LIVES
CHAPTER XXI THE NIGHT-SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOLMASTER BARTLE MASSEY'S WAS ONE OF A FEW SCATTERED HOUSES ON THE EDGE OF A COMMON WHICH WAS DIVIDED BY THE ROAD TO TREDDLESTON
BUT DON'T SAY I'M ILL
IT WAS MARCH NOW
HAPPILY IRWINE AND GAWAINE WERE COMING TO DINNER AND BY TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE CHASE MILES BEHIND HIM
THEN AFTER A PAUSE SHE ADDED BUT YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME
I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
OH HOW LONG THE TIME WAS IN THAT DARKNESS
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEE HER ADVANCE WITH A MEASURED STEP AND A DEMURE SOLEMNITY OF COUNTENANCE
THERE HE SAID PATTING HER ON THE BACK GO AND KISS YOUR AUNT AND YOUR GRANDFATHER
THE KITCHEN OUGHT NOT TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
ADAM AFTER MAKING AN INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT TO EAT PUT THE FOOD IN HIS POCKET AND DRINKING A DRAUGHT OF ALE DECLARED HIMSELF READY TO SET OFF
ONLY SATISFIED HIS OWN PASSION ONLY WREAKED HIS OWN VENGEANCE
NOT ONE OF THEM COULD READ
IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID I WONDER IF DINAH UD HA GONE TO SEE HER
MOTHER'S A BIT AILING AND SHE'S SET HER HEART ON YOUR COMING TO STAY THE NIGHT WITH HER IF YOU'LL BE SO KIND
HE ALMOST WISHED HIS ARM WOULD GET PAINFUL AGAIN AND THEN HE SHOULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE COMFORT IT WOULD BE TO GET RID OF THE PAIN
AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE FEELS NOTHING O THE SORT EH DONNA TELL ME WHAT THEE'T SURE ON
DINAH HAD NEVER SEEN HETTY AFFECTED IN THIS WAY BEFORE AND WITH HER USUAL BENIGNANT HOPEFULNESS SHE TRUSTED IT WAS THE STIRRING OF A DIVINE IMPULSE
AT OTHER TIMES OVER THE NEW TESTAMENT A VERY SOLEMN LOOK WOULD COME UPON HIS FACE AND HE WOULD EVERY NOW AND THEN SHAKE HIS HEAD IN SERIOUS ASSENT OR JUST LIFT UP HIS HAND AND LET IT FALL AGAIN
THE SOFT AIR DID NOT HELP HIS RESOLUTION AS HE LEANED OUT AND LOOKED INTO THE LEAFY DISTANCE
HE COULD NOT SEE HER WHEN HE ENTERED FOR AGITATION DEADENED HIS SENSES AND THE DIM CELL WAS ALMOST DARK TO HIM
IT WAS A PRETTY SCENE IN THE RED FIRE-LIGHT
AN WHEN THE BIBLE'S SUCH A BIG BOOK AN THEE CANST READ ALL THRO'T AN HA THE PICK O THE TEXES I CANNA THINK WHY THEE DOSTNA PICK BETTER WORDS AS DONNA MEAN SO MUCH MORE NOR THEY SAY
HETTY WAS NOT QUITE AS FOND OF THE LOCKET AS OF THE EAR-RINGS THOUGH IT WAS A HANDSOME LARGE LOCKET WITH ENAMELLED FLOWERS AT THE BACK AND A BEAUTIFUL GOLD BORDER ROUND THE GLASS WHICH SHOWED A LIGHT-BROWN SLIGHTLY WAVING LOCK FORMING A BACKGROUND FOR TWO LITTLE DARK RINGS
THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK--AS FOR ALL I'M A WOMAN AND THERE'S FOLKS AS THINKS A WOMAN'S FOOL ENOUGH TO STAN BY AN LOOK ON WHILE THE MEN SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER--I SAY IF MR THURLE'S SO READY TO TAKE FARMS UNDER YOU IT'S A PITY BUT WHAT HE SHOULD TAKE THIS AND SEE IF HE LIKES TO LIVE IN A HOUSE WI ALL THE PLAGUES O EGYPT IN'T--WI THE CELLAR FULL O WATER AND FROGS AND TOADS HOPPIN UP THE STEPS BY DOZENS--AND THE FLOORS ROTTEN AND THE RATS AND MICE GNAWING EVERY BIT O CHEESE AND RUNNIN OVER OUR HEADS AS WE LIE I BED TILL WE EXPECT EM TO EAT US UP ALIVE--AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MR CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE
HOWEVER ARTHUR DONNITHORNE AS HE WINDS AMONG THE PLEASANT LANES ON HORSEBACK IN THE MORNING SUNSHINE HAS A SINCERE DETERMINATION TO OPEN HIS HEART TO THE RECTOR AND THE SWIRLING SOUND OF THE SCYTHE AS HE PASSES BY THE MEADOW IS ALL THE PLEASANTER TO HIM BECAUSE OF THIS HONEST PURPOSE
NO SHE WAS NOT THINKING MOST OF THE GIVER WHEN SHE SMILED AT THE EAR-RINGS FOR NOW SHE IS TAKING THEM OUT OF THE BOX NOT TO PRESS THEM TO HER LIPS BUT TO FASTEN THEM IN HER EARS--ONLY FOR ONE MOMENT TO SEE HOW PRETTY THEY LOOK AS SHE PEEPS AT THEM IN THE GLASS AGAINST THE WALL WITH FIRST ONE POSITION OF THE HEAD AND THEN ANOTHER LIKE A LISTENING BIRD
SIT DOWN HERE HE POINTED TO A CHAIR JUST OPPOSITE TO HIM AT NO MORE THAN A YARD'S DISTANCE FROM HIS OWN AND ADAM SAT DOWN WITH A SENSE THAT THIS COLD MANNER OF MR IRWINE'S GAVE AN ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED DIFFICULTY TO HIS DISCLOSURE
FOR I CANNA BELIEVE YOU'D LET ANY MAN KISS YOU BY YOURSELVES AND GIVE YOU A GOLD BOX WITH HIS HAIR AND GO A-WALKING I THE GROVE TO MEET HIM IF YOU DIDNA LOVE HIM
HER HEAD WAS ALLAYS LIKELY TO BE TURNED HE THOUGHT WHEN A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS FINE MANNERS AND FINE CLOTHES AND HIS WHITE HANDS AND THAT WAY O TALKING GENTLEFOLKS HAVE CAME ABOUT HER MAKING UP TO HER IN A BOLD WAY AS A MAN COULDN'T DO THAT WAS ONLY HER EQUAL
BUT WHEN I SAW IT WAS GONE I WAS STRUCK LIKE A STONE WITH FEAR
AND CASSON--HE'S ALWAYS FOR SETTING OTHER FOLKS RIGHT YOU KNOW--WOULD HAVE IT BURGE WAS THE MAN TO HAVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WOODS
BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO FEEL VERY MUCH AS IF THE CONSTABLE HAD COME TO TAKE HER UP AND CARRY HER BEFORE THE JUSTICE FOR SOME UNDEFINED OFFENCE
NEVER MIND ABOUT LOSING AN HOUR AT THY WORK
ON HETTY'S BLOOMING HEALTH IT WOULD TAKE A GREAT DEAL OF SUCH MENTAL SUFFERING AS HERS TO LEAVE ANY DEEP IMPRESS
HE LODGES OVER A TINMAN'S SHOP IN THE STREET ON THE RIGHT HAND AS YOU ENTERED THE PRISON
WHAT CAN A WOMAN HAVE TO SET HER OFF BETTER THAN HER OWN HAIR WHEN IT CURLS SO LIKE YOURS
AND THE PICTURE WE ARE APT TO MAKE OF METHODISM IN OUR IMAGINATION IS NOT AN AMPHITHEATRE OF GREEN HILLS OR THE DEEP SHADE OF BROAD-LEAVED SYCAMORES WHERE A CROWD OF ROUGH MEN AND WEARY-HEARTED WOMEN DRANK IN A FAITH WHICH WAS A RUDIMENTARY CULTURE WHICH LINKED THEIR THOUGHTS WITH THE PAST LIFTED THEIR IMAGINATION ABOVE THE SORDID DETAILS OF THEIR OWN NARROW LIVES AND SUFFUSED THEIR SOULS WITH THE SENSE OF A PITYING LOVING INFINITE PRESENCE SWEET AS SUMMER TO THE HOUSELESS NEEDY
AND BY THE TIME THE GRAND CLIMAX OF THE DONKEY-RACE CAME ON HER DISAPPOINTMENT WAS ENTIRELY LOST IN THE DELIGHTFUL EXCITEMENT OF ATTEMPTING TO STIMULATE THE LAST DONKEY BY HISSES WHILE THE BOYS APPLIED THE ARGUMENT OF STICKS
HE'LL NE'ER THINK O MARRYING IF IT ISNA PUT INTO'S HEAD AN IF THEE'DST ANY LOVE FOR THY MOTHER THEE'DST PUT HIM UP TO'T AN NOT LET HER GO AWAY OUT O MY SIGHT WHEN I MIGHT HA HER TO MAKE A BIT O COMFORT FOR ME AFORE I GO TO BED TO MY OLD MAN UNDER THE WHITE THORN NAY MOTHER SAID SETH THEE MUSTNA THINK ME UNKIND BUT I SHOULD BE GOING AGAINST MY CONSCIENCE IF I TOOK UPON ME TO SAY WHAT DINAH'S FEELINGS ARE
AYE AYE HE'S GOOD METAL
HE HAD KNOWN PLENTY OF TROUBLE AND VEXATION SINCE HE HAD BEEN A LAD BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST SORROW THAT HAD HEMMED IN HIS VOICE AND STRANGELY ENOUGH IT WAS SORROW BECAUSE THE CHIEF SOURCE OF HIS PAST TROUBLE AND VEXATION WAS FOR EVER GONE OUT OF HIS REACH
BUT IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE HE TURNED ROUND AND STEPPED NEARER TO ARTHUR STANDING AND LOOKING DOWN ON HIM AS HE LAY
FRIDAY WAS A FORTNIGHT--IT WAS THE DAY AS DINAH WENT AWAY--THERE COME NOBODY
AND WE FOUND HER WI HER LITTLE SHOES STUCK I THE MUD AN CRYING FIT TO BREAK HER HEART BY THE FAR HORSE-PIT
BUT WHERE'S THE USE OF ALL THE TIME I'VE SPENT IN TEACHING YOU WRITING AND MAPPING AND MENSURATION IF YOU'RE NOT TO GET FOR'ARD IN THE WORLD AND SHOW FOLKS THERE'S SOME ADVANTAGE IN HAVING A HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS INSTEAD OF A TURNIP
HER HEART HAS SWELLED SO THE TEARS STAND IN HER EYES
BUT I FOUND IT OUT BY CHANCE
WE'LL HANG UP TH DOOR AT FUR END O TH SHOP AN WRITE ON'T SETH BEDE THE METHODY HIS WORK HERE JIM LEND'S HOULD O TH RED POT NONSENSE SAID ADAM
THE REAPING OF THE WHEAT HAD BEGUN IN OUR NORTH MIDLAND COUNTY OF LOAMSHIRE BUT THE HARVEST WAS LIKELY STILL TO BE RETARDED BY THE HEAVY RAINS WHICH WERE CAUSING INUNDATIONS AND MUCH DAMAGE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
HE HAD NEVER BEEN JEALOUS OF HIS MOTHER'S FONDNESS FOR ADAM
YOU WANT TO LEARN ACCOUNTS--THAT'S WELL AND GOOD
ADAM WAS WISE ENOUGH TO CHOOSE A COMPACT PROVENCE ROSE THAT PEEPED OUT HALF-SMOTHERED BY ITS FLAUNTING SCENTLESS NEIGHBOURS AND HELD IT IN HIS HAND--HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD BE MORE AT EASE HOLDING SOMETHING IN HIS HAND--AS HE WALKED ON TO THE FAR END OF THE GARDEN WHERE HE REMEMBERED THERE WAS THE LARGEST ROW OF CURRANT-TREES NOT FAR OFF FROM THE GREAT YEW-TREE ARBOUR
NOW THAT'S AN AESOP'S FABLE IN A SENTENCE BUT IT WILL BE A BAD BUSINESS IF THE OLD GENTLEMAN TURNS THEM OUT OF THE FARM NEXT MICHAELMAS EH SAID MRS IRWINE
IF HE FOUND NO TRACE OF HETTY ON THE ROAD HE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO ARTHUR DONNITHORNE AND MAKE HIMSELF CERTAIN HOW FAR HE WAS ACQUAINTED WITH HER MOVEMENTS
HOW'S THAT
POOR SETH HAS LOOKED RATHER DOWN-HEARTED OF LATE
ACCORDINGLY FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS--EVER SINCE HE HAD SUPERINTENDED THE BUILDING OF THE NEW BARN--ADAM HAD ALWAYS BEEN MADE WELCOME AT THE HALL FARM ESPECIALLY OF A WINTER EVENING WHEN THE WHOLE FAMILY IN PATRIARCHAL FASHION MASTER AND MISTRESS CHILDREN AND SERVANTS WERE ASSEMBLED IN THAT GLORIOUS KITCHEN AT WELL-GRADUATED DISTANCES FROM THE BLAZING FIRE
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL MUCH NOR READ BOOKS AND WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ANYTHING BUT WHAT HAPPENS JUST ROUND US
AND NOW SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO PUT ON HER LONG SLEEVES HER NEW WHITE GAUZE NECKERCHIEF AND HER STRAW HAT TRIMMED WITH WHITE TO-DAY INSTEAD OF THE PINK WHICH HAD BECOME RATHER FADED UNDER THE JULY SUN
BUT I DOUBT WE SHALL NE'ER GO FAR ENOUGH FOR FOLKS NOT TO FIND OUT AS WE'VE GOT THEM BELONGING TO US AS ARE TRANSPORTED O'ER THE SEAS AND WERE LIKE TO BE HANGED
THE LEVEL RAYS OF THE LOW AFTERNOON SUN ENTERED DIRECTLY AT THE WINDOW AND AS ARTHUR SEATED HIMSELF IN HIS VELVET CHAIR WITH THEIR PLEASANT WARMTH UPON HIM HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THAT QUIET WELL-BEING WHICH PERHAPS YOU AND I HAVE FELT ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON WHEN IN OUR BRIGHTEST YOUTH AND HEALTH LIFE HAS OPENED A NEW VISTA FOR US AND LONG TO-MORROWS OF ACTIVITY HAVE STRETCHED BEFORE US LIKE A LOVELY PLAIN WHICH THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HURRYING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL OUR OWN
AN WHAT'S LIKING GOT TO DO WI'T
IT IS NOT ONLY YOU--SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW-CREATURES
HE WILL KNOW ALL AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES BUT YOU DON'T MIND ABOUT IT SAID ADAM INDIGNANTLY
ON THE HALF-DOZEN WELL-TO-DO FARMERS WITH THEIR APPLE-CHEEKED FAMILIES
HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE
I DIDN'T MEAN TO VEX YOU
HE WOULD COME HOME TO-DAY SURELY FOR THE BUSINESS WOULD BE WANTING HIM SADLY BY TO-MORROW BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TO THINK HE HAD HAD A LONGER HOLIDAY THAN HE HAD EXPECTED
MR GAWAINE BROUGHT MISS LYDIA LOOKING NEUTRAL AND STIFF IN AN ELEGANT PEACH-BLOSSOM SILK
I FEEL IT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR WORRYING ME HE WAS AWARE OF HIS INDISCRETION AS SOON AS THE WORDS HAD ESCAPED HIM
BUT THAT ISN'T ALL I DOUBT
AND IF THINGS CAME ROUND THAT WAY I'D RATHER BE BEHOLDING TO HIM NOR TO ANY MAN I THE WORLD POOR ADAM WAS LED ON TO SPEAK ABOUT ARTHUR BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HETTY WOULD BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT THE YOUNG SQUIRE WAS SO READY TO BEFRIEND HIM
AND THOUGH WE'VE MAYHAPPEN GOT CONTRAIRY WAYS O THINKING ABOUT A MANY THINGS--ONE MAN LAYS DOWN HIS LAND ONE WAY AN ANOTHER ANOTHER--AN I'LL NOT TAKE IT UPON ME TO SPEAK TO NO MAN'S FARMING BUT MY OWN--THIS I'LL SAY AS WE'RE ALL O ONE MIND ABOUT OUR YOUNG SQUIRE
BUT IT WOULDN'T BECOME WISE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME TO BE MAKING A FUSS ABOUT TRIFLES AS IF WE THOUGHT THE CHURCH WAS IN DANGER BECAUSE WILL MASKERY LETS HIS TONGUE WAG RATHER FOOLISHLY OR A YOUNG WOMAN TALKS IN A SERIOUS WAY TO A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ON THE GREEN
BUT I AM OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS REVERENCE WAS HIS OWN SKILL TOWARDS WHICH HE PERFORMED SOME RATHER AFFECTING ACTS OF WORSHIP
THEN HE WOULD SIT DOWN AND HIDE HIS FACE AND NO SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BUT THE TICKING OF THE WATCH ON THE TABLE OR THE FALLING OF A CINDER FROM THE FIRE WHICH THE SCHOOLMASTER CAREFULLY TENDED
DINAH DID NOT SIT DOWN AT FIRST BUT MOVED ABOUT SERVING THE OTHERS WITH THE WARM PORRIDGE AND THE TOASTED OAT-CAKE WHICH SHE HAD GOT READY IN THE USUAL WAY FOR SHE HAD ASKED SETH TO TELL HER JUST WHAT HIS MOTHER GAVE THEM FOR BREAKFAST
HE WAS A LITTLE MORE SEVERE THAN USUAL ON JACOB STOREY'S Z'S OF WHICH POOR JACOB HAD WRITTEN A PAGEFUL ALL WITH THEIR TOPS TURNED THE WRONG WAY WITH A PUZZLED SENSE THAT THEY WERE NOT RIGHT SOMEHOW BUT HE OBSERVED IN APOLOGY THAT IT WAS A LETTER YOU NEVER WANTED HARDLY AND HE THOUGHT IT HAD ONLY BEEN THERE TO FINISH OFF TH ALPHABET LIKE THOUGH AMPUSAND WOULD HA DONE AS WELL FOR WHAT HE COULD SEE AT LAST THE PUPILS HAD ALL TAKEN THEIR HATS AND SAID THEIR GOOD-NIGHTS AND ADAM KNOWING HIS OLD MASTER'S HABITS ROSE AND SAID SHALL I PUT THE CANDLES OUT MR MASSEY YES MY BOY YES ALL BUT THIS WHICH I'LL CARRY INTO THE HOUSE
THERE WAS A ROW OF BUSHY FILBERTS IN ONE DIRECTION AND IN ANOTHER A HUGE APPLE-TREE MAKING A BARREN CIRCLE UNDER ITS LOW-SPREADING BOUGHS
IT WAS ONCE THE RESIDENCE OF A COUNTRY SQUIRE WHOSE FAMILY PROBABLY DWINDLING DOWN TO MERE SPINSTERHOOD GOT MERGED IN THE MORE TERRITORIAL NAME OF DONNITHORNE
DON'T YOU SAY ALMOST EVERY DAY THIS AND THAT WILL HAPPEN PLEASE GOD AND WE SHALL BEGIN TO CUT THE GRASS SOON PLEASE GOD TO SEND US A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE
YOU DIDNA MEAN TO BE LATE I'LL BE BOUND BUT YOUR AUNT'S BEEN WORRITED TO-DAY
PERHAPS IT WAS AN ANGEL
TWENTY MINUTES PAST EIGHT--BUT MY WATCH IS TOO FAST
IF YOU GET HOLD OF A CHAP THAT'S GOT NO SHAME NOR CONSCIENCE TO STOP HIM YOU MUST TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO BY BUNGING HIS EYES UP ARTHUR DID NOT LAUGH FOR HE WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH SOME THOUGHT THAT MADE HIM SAY PRESENTLY I SHOULD THINK NOW ADAM YOU NEVER HAVE ANY STRUGGLES WITHIN YOURSELF
YOU'RE SURPRISED TO SEE ME AT THIS HOUR O THE DAY SAID ADAM
AN I'M THINKIN I WOULDNA MIND IF YE'D STAY AN SLEEP HERE FOR I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YE I TH HOUSE I TH MORNIN BUT MAYHAPPEN THEY'LL BE LOOKIN FOR YE AT MESTER POYSER'S NO SAID DINAH THEY DON'T EXPECT ME AND I SHOULD LIKE TO STAY IF YOU'LL LET ME WELL THERE'S ROOM
NO CASTING UP OR DOWN OF THE EYELIDS NO COMPRESSION OF THE LIPS NO ATTITUDE OF THE ARMS THAT SAID BUT YOU MUST THINK OF ME AS A SAINT SHE HELD NO BOOK IN HER UNGLOVED HANDS BUT LET THEM HANG DOWN LIGHTLY CROSSED BEFORE HER AS SHE STOOD AND TURNED HER GREY EYES ON THE PEOPLE
SHE DIDN'T KNOW ONE BIT HOW TO SPEAK TO A GENTLEMAN LIKE MR ARTHUR AND HER VERY VANITY MADE HER MORE COY OF SPEECH
IT WAS AN ILL-SMELLING CLOSE PLACE BUT WARM AND THERE WAS STRAW ON THE GROUND
IS HE TO GO FREE WHILE THEY LAY ALL THE PUNISHMENT ON HER...SO WEAK AND YOUNG THE IMAGE CALLED UP BY THESE LAST WORDS GAVE A NEW DIRECTION TO POOR ADAM'S MADDENED FEELINGS
SHE HAS BEEN WATCHING WITH DIM EYES THE GRADUALLY ENLARGING SPECK WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES SHE HAS BEEN QUITE SURE IS HER DARLING SON ADAM
WHY I THINK WE SHALL HAVE THE FOWL STOLE BEFORE WE ARE MUCH OLDER WI THAT GELL FORGETTING TO LOCK THE PENS UP O NIGHTS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S TO BE DONE ADAM RELEASED DINAH'S HAND AS HE CEASED SPEAKING AND WAS EXPECTING AN ANSWER BUT BEFORE SHE HAD OPENED HER LIPS MRS POYSER SAID LOOK THERE NOW
UPON MY WORD HE SAID AS THEY ENTERED THE COOL CLOISTERS I THINK THE COTTAGERS HAVE THE BEST OF IT
AND YET--SUCH IS THE STRANGE ACTION OF OUR SOULS DRAWING US BY A LURKING DESIRE TOWARDS THE VERY ENDS WE DREAD--HETTY WHEN SHE SET OUT AGAIN FROM NORTON ASKED THE STRAIGHTEST ROAD NORTHWARDS TOWARDS STONYSHIRE AND KEPT IT ALL THAT DAY
IT WAS A LATCH WITH A BOLT INSIDE AND WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE HOUSE I ALWAYS WENT OUT AT THE SHOP DOOR
HERE PUG YOU RASCAL IT IS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE SOME MEN TURN ROUND
YOU FANCY SO BECAUSE YOU DONNA KNOW IT MY WENCH
SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP
THOUGH SAID MRS POYSER BY WAY OF CONCLUSION YOU MIGHT TELL HER SHE'S GOT BUT ONE AUNT LEFT AND SHE'S WASTED PRETTY NIGH TO A SHADDER
THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH
HE WALKED GENTLY ALONG THE YARD AND TURNED THE KEY GENTLY IN THE DOOR
HER FLUSH HAD DIED AWAY ALMOST TO PALENESS
YE MIGHT HA MADE THE PARRIDGE WORSE SHE SAID TO DINAH
ADAM AND SETH WERE COMING NEXT WITH THEIR MOTHER BETWEEN THEM
IT SEEMS AS IF WHEN YOU ARE GONE I COULD NEVER JOY IN ANYTHING ANY MORE
BUT I'LL NOT THROW AWAY GOOD KNOWLEDGE ON PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN GET IT BY THE SIXPENN'ORTH AND CARRY IT AWAY WITH EM AS THEY WOULD AN OUNCE OF SNUFF
THE STRANGER HAD CEASED TO DOUBT AS HE HAD DONE AT THE FIRST GLANCE THAT SHE COULD FIX THE ATTENTION OF HER ROUGHER HEARERS BUT STILL HE WONDERED WHETHER SHE COULD HAVE THAT POWER OF ROUSING THEIR MORE VIOLENT EMOTIONS WHICH MUST SURELY BE A NECESSARY SEAL OF HER VOCATION AS A METHODIST PREACHER UNTIL SHE CAME TO THE WORDS LOST!--SINNERS WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE IN HER VOICE AND MANNER
HE FEELS VERY GRATEFUL AND AFFECTIONATE TOWARD DINAH BUT HE'S NO THOUGHTS TOWARDS HER THAT UD INCLINE HIM TO MAKE HER HIS WIFE AND I DON'T BELIEVE DINAH UD MARRY HIM EITHER
THE MARKS OF THY AGONY ARE UPON THEE--I SEE I SEE THOU ART ABLE AND WILLING TO SAVE--THOU WILT NOT LET HER PERISH FOR EVER
ANYBODY AT THE TOWN WOULD TELL HIM THE WAY TO SLOMAN'S END
AND I SHOULD BE GLAD OF IT FOR IF EVER ANYTHING HAPPENS HE'S SURE TO BE GONE TO THE SCANTLANDS
WHY HE'S I THE RIGHT TO LAUGH AT ME--I CANNA HELP LAUGHING AT MYSELF I SHAN'T LOOSE HIM TILL HE PROMISES TO LET THE DOOR ALONE SAID ADAM
SHE CARRIED HER BASKET
THAT IS AS MUCH LIKE THE REAL THING AS THE BIRD WALTZ IS LIKE THE SONG OF BIRDS
HE CREATED THE MIND HE BELIEVED IN OUT OF HIS OWN WHICH WAS LARGE UNSELFISH TENDER
MOLLY UNABLE TO IMAGINE ANY CAUSE FOR TEARS IN CHURCH EXCEPT FAINTNESS OF WHICH SHE HAD A VAGUE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE DREW OUT OF HER POCKET A QUEER LITTLE FLAT BLUE SMELLING-BOTTLE AND AFTER MUCH LABOUR IN PULLING THE CORK OUT THRUST THE NARROW NECK AGAINST HETTY'S NOSTRILS
BUT YOU MIGHT RUN OVER THE TOWN BEFORE YOU FOUND OUT
WE MUST PART NOT IF YOU LOVE ME DINAH--NOT IF YOU LOVE ME ADAM SAID PASSIONATELY
LET'S HEAR NO MORE ON'T WHEN HETTY WAS GONE UPSTAIRS HE SAID I CANNA MAKE IT OUT AS SHE SHOULD WANT TO GO AWAY FOR I THOUGHT SHE'D GOT A MIND T ADAM BEDE
AH HE SAID THAT'S LIKE THE LADIES IN THE PICTURES AT THE CHASE
IT ISN'T AS I MIND MUCH ABOUT GETTING ANY MORE MONEY
IT SEEMS AS IF I COULD SIT SILENT ALL DAY LONG WITH THE THOUGHT OF GOD OVERFLOWING MY SOUL--AS THE PEBBLES LIE BATHED IN THE WILLOW BROOK
HE WOULD NOT GO TO THE HERMITAGE AGAIN
HOWEVER HIS MASTER HAD FORGIVEN HIM AND CONTINUED TO EMPLOY HIM FOR THE THOLOWAYS HAD LIVED ON THE COMMON TIME OUT OF MIND AND HAD ALWAYS WORKED FOR THE POYSERS
AND WHEN I'VE OPENED THE BIBLE FOR DIRECTION I'VE ALWAYS LIGHTED ON SOME CLEAR WORD TO TELL ME WHERE MY WORK LAY
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME CLEVER OR STUPID--ONE CAN'T TRUST EM OUT O ONE'S SIGHT A MINUTE
IT IS SO NEEDFUL WE SHOULD REMEMBER THEIR EXISTENCE ELSE WE MAY HAPPEN TO LEAVE THEM QUITE OUT OF OUR RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY AND FRAME LOFTY THEORIES WHICH ONLY FIT A WORLD OF EXTREMES
SO DINAH LIFTED HIM UP AND HELD TH LAD ON HER LAP WHILE SHE WENT ON SPEAKING
GOOD-NIGHT ADAM
WHEN SHE HAD FORMED HER PLAN OF GOING TO WINDSOR SHE HAD NOT FORESEEN ANY DIFFICULTIES EXCEPT THAT OF GETTING AWAY AND AFTER SHE HAD OVERCOME THIS BY PROPOSING THE VISIT TO DINAH HER THOUGHTS FLEW TO THE MEETING WITH ARTHUR AND THE QUESTION HOW HE WOULD BEHAVE TO HER--NOT RESTING ON ANY PROBABLE INCIDENTS OF THE JOURNEY
NOT THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION OF PAIN INTO SYMPATHY HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN PLACE IN ADAM YET
THE OLD WOMAN'S SIGHT SEEMED TO BE DIM FOR SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ADAM TILL HE SAID HERE'S THE KEY DOLLY
THEE'ST NO RIGHT TO SAY WHAT DINAH'S FEELINGS ARE IF SHE HASNA TOLD THEE AND IT UD DO NOTHING BUT MISCHIEF TO SAY SUCH THINGS TO ADAM
FOR WHENEVER ADAM CAME TO THE HALL FARM HETTY SEEMED TO BE IN BETTER SPIRITS AND TO TALK MORE THAN AT OTHER TIMES THOUGH SHE WAS ALMOST SULLEN WHEN MR CRAIG OR ANY OTHER ADMIRER HAPPENED TO PAY A VISIT THERE
WHEN ADAM WAS APPROACHING UNSEEN BY HER SHE WAS ABSORBED AS USUAL IN THINKING AND WONDERING ABOUT ARTHUR'S POSSIBLE RETURN
FOR MY PART I COULDN'T LIVE IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE I WAS NOT RESPECTED AND BELOVED
HE FELT THE SITUATION ACUTELY FELT THE SORROW OF THE DEAR THING IN THE PRESENT AND THOUGHT WITH A DARKER ANXIETY OF THE TENACITY WHICH HER FEELINGS MIGHT HAVE IN THE FUTURE
APROPOS OF MARRYING I HOPE OUR FRIEND ADAM WILL GET SETTLED NOW THE POOR OLD MAN'S GONE
BUT IF YOU HAD A FRIEND TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AFTER DEATH--IN THAT OTHER WORLD--SOME ONE WHOSE LOVE IS GREATER THAN MINE--WHO CAN DO EVERYTHING?...IF GOD OUR FATHER WAS YOUR FRIEND AND WAS WILLING TO SAVE YOU FROM SIN AND SUFFERING SO AS YOU SHOULD NEITHER KNOW WICKED FEELINGS NOR PAIN AGAIN
HAVE YE BEEN ALL THIS TIME AWAY AND NOT BROUGHT THE LASSES BACK AFTER ALL
IF YOU SPARE HIM I'LL EXPOSE HIM I THINK YOUR DEMAND IS JUST ADAM SAID MR IRWINE BUT WHEN YOU ARE CALMER YOU WILL JUDGE ARTHUR MORE MERCIFULLY
A TALL YOUNG OFFICER WITH A FAIRISH SKIN AND REDDISH WHISKERS--AND HAD A SERVANT BY THE NAME O PYM OH YES SAID HETTY
HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY
CHAPTER XLIII THE VERDICT THE PLACE FITTED UP THAT DAY AS A COURT OF JUSTICE WAS A GRAND OLD HALL NOW DESTROYED BY FIRE
HE BEGAN TO LIE IN A MORE VOLUNTARY POSITION AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE LESS OVERPOWERED BY BODILY SENSATIONS
HE MUST SPEAK THERE AND THEN
IT WAS JUST AS LIKELY TO BE THE REVERSE
SOMEHOW THE CONGREGATION BEGAN TO FALL OFF AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SPEAK LIGHT O MR RYDE
HE KNEW IT WAS SETH RETURNING FROM AN EVENING PREACHING AND MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE HIM
BUT HER SONS SAY SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOUNG WOMEN ABOUT HER COMMONLY
TOTTY'S A LITTLE WOMAN AN NOT A BABBY IT'S NO USE TRYING TO PERSUADE HER SAID MRS POYSER
THE RIDER LOOKS AS IF HIS EYES WERE GLAZED BY MADNESS AND HE SAW NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS UNSEEN BY OTHERS
THOSE KITTENLIKE GLANCES AND MOVEMENTS ARE JUST WHAT ONE WANTS TO MAKE ONE'S HEARTH A PARADISE
WHENEVER THE THOUGHT OF WRITING TO ARTHUR HAD OCCURRED TO HER SHE HAD REJECTED IT
THE HORSES WERE BEING LED OUT TO WATERING AMIDST MUCH BARKING OF ALL THE THREE DOGS AND MANY WHUPS FROM TIM THE PLOUGHMAN AS IF THE HEAVY ANIMALS WHO HELD DOWN THEIR MEEK INTELLIGENT HEADS AND LIFTED THEIR SHAGGY FEET SO DELIBERATELY WERE LIKELY TO RUSH WILDLY IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THE RIGHT
SHE ROAMED UP AND DOWN THINKING THERE WAS PERHAPS A POOL IN EVERY HOLLOW BEFORE SHE CAME TO IT TILL HER LIMBS WERE WEARY AND SHE SAT DOWN TO REST
BUT I WAS FRIGHTENED TO STAY
OLD JOSHWAY AS HE IS IRREVERENTLY CALLED BY HIS NEIGHBOURS IS IN A STATE OF SIMMERING INDIGNATION
AND WHEN SHE WAS IN HER BEDROOM AGAIN THE POSSIBILITY OF HER MARRYING ADAM PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER IN A NEW LIGHT
AND ALONG WITH THAT WOULD COME A WONDERING THANKFULNESS THAT ALL THIS HAPPINESS WAS GIVEN TO HIM--THAT THIS LIFE OF OURS HAD SUCH SWEETNESS IN IT
LET EM FOLLOW THEIR CONSCIENCES THAT'S ALL
NOT WHEN IT'S SO HEAVY
