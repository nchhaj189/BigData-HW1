YOU KNOW I HAVE MY POLICE VERY WELL
DELIGHTED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND THE SUCCESS OF THE EVENING THEY RETURNED TO LOOK AFTER THEIR COMPANION
IT IS THE HOUR FOR SIGNING HIS PAPERS WITH A FEVERISH IMPATIENCE SHE ROSE AND WALKED TOWARDS THE MIRROR IN WHICH SHE SMILED WITH A RESOLUTE SMILE OF DEVOTEDNESS
WHO WILL SAVE YOU THEN
THAT THAT YOUNG MAN IS AN ASSASSIN WHO SAID THAT
FOUQUET'S ORDERS HE KNEW HIS MASTER SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO BE AWARE THAT HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN EVERY GENTLEMAN IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND THAT ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE NEW-COMERS HE WOULD DO AS MUCH FOR THEM AS HE HAD DONE FOR THE OTHERS EXCELLENT
WHAT IS HE DOING NOW IN ALL PROBABILITY HE IS ASLEEP OR IF NOT ASLEEP DREAMING AND WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING ALL THE EVENING DANCING THE FAMOUS BALLET
YOU HAVE DISCOVERED A THIRD WAY OF KILLING ME BUT HAPPILY IT IS THE SLOWEST WAY IS IT NOT SHE REPLIED AS SHE LED HIM TOWARDS THE GROVE OF TREES THEY HAD SO LATELY QUITTED
THEN OBSERVING THAT THE PARK WAS NEARLY DESERTED THAT THE ILLUMINATIONS BEGAN TO BURN OUT AND THAT THE MORNING BREEZE WAS SETTING IN HE TURNED TO THE LEFT AND ENTERED THE CHATEAU AGAIN BY ONE OF THE SMALLER COURTYARDS
ONE MUST BE A WOMAN TO UNDERSTAND IT SIRE--THEY HAVE MADE ME SHED TEARS AND WITH ONE OF HER FINGERS WHOSE SLENDERNESS AND PERFECT WHITENESS WERE UNEQUALED SHE POINTED TO HER BRILLIANT EYES SWIMMING WITH UNSHED DROPS AND AGAIN BEGAN TO WEEP
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT FULL OF TRIUMPH AND DELIGHT AS YOU WERE JUST NOW THE SIGHT MERELY OF THAT MAN IS CAPABLE OF DISPIRITING YOU
FAREWELL M
TO THIS DE GUICHE FULL OF MISTRUST AND PRESENCE OF MIND REPLIED YES CHEVALIER
LET US REACH OUR CARRIAGES MY DEAR D'HERBLAY ARAMIS LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT THE HEAVENS
SHE THEN OPENED THE DOOR OF HER ORATORY AND WITHOUT EVEN TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS MARGUERITE VANEL ENTERED IT CLOSING THE DOOR AFTER HER
DID YOU SAY IT WAS AN HOUR AGO SHE MADE THIS CONFESSION MADAME INQUIRED
DE GUICHE STOPPED AS HE RECOGNIZED HER AND SAID HURRIEDLY,--"GOOD EVENING MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
I THOUGHT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD I SHOULD DO SO THE FACT IS THAT RAOUL UNINFLUENCED BY DEVOTION MEASURING THE RISK THEY RUN SAW HOW IMMINENT THE DANGER WAS BUT HE WILLINGLY ALLOWED HIMSELF TO ACCEPT A PERIL WHICH DE WARDES HAD DECLINED
DE WARDES CAN JOIN US AT ANY TIME
MONTALAIS AND TONNAY-CHARENTE IMMEDIATELY DREW BACK AND KEPT AT A DISTANCE
MADAME DE BELLIERE GAVE THE COACHMAN A LOUIS SMILED GRACEFULLY AT THE CLERK AND DISMISSED THEM BOTH
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK AT IT AS YOU RETURN TO TAKE YOUR CLOAK I SHOULD FOR I LIKE TO LOOK AT AUTOGRAPHS WELL THEN THIS ONE IS OF THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY
YES IT IS SAID SO REPLIED ARAMIS LOOKING QUIETLY AT FOUQUET
I AM DOING NO HARM I SUPPOSE AND THAT GREAT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING MADEMOISELLE RESUMED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY POINTING TO MALICORNE IS HE HERE TO DO ANY GOOD I ASK YOU HE IS NEITHER HERE FOR GOOD NOR HARM MADAME
NO I AM MISTAKEN
WHAT HAVE I TO FORGIVE M
MADAME WAS STILL SEATED AT THE TABLE WHERE SHE HAD WRITTEN HER LETTER
WHEN THE SERVANTS ANNOUNCED MADAME VANEL TO MADAME DE BELLIERE THE LATTER WAS ENGAGED OR RATHER WAS ABSORBED IN READING A LETTER WHICH SHE HURRIEDLY CONCEALED
BUT ON ONE CONDITION ONLY THAT SHE WOULD BE READY TO SET OUT EARLY
A COURT DINNER HAD SUCCEEDED THEN CARDS AND AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM THE KING LEAVING THE CARD-TABLES AT EIGHT O'CLOCK PASSED INTO HIS CABINET IN ORDER TO WORK WITH M
EXCELLENT WHISPERED SAINT-AIGNAN
AND IT WILL BE MY OWN FAULT IF I AM NOT THE FIRST TO RELATE IT THE KING APPROACHED HIM AND WITH A TREMBLING VOICE AND A PASSIONATE GESTURE SAID NOT A SYLLABLE COMTE THE POOR KING FORGOT THAT ONLY AN HOUR BEFORE HE HAD GIVEN HIM A SIMILAR RECOMMENDATION BUT WITH THE VERY OPPOSITE INTENTION
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE MONSIEUR OF WHICH YOU HAVE TO INFORM ME SAID THE KING WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN ALONE WITH D'ARTAGNAN
FOUQUET SHE WAS READING WHEN I ARRIVED AND THEN DARTED OUT OF THE ROOM
YOUR SURPRISE IS BEFORE YOU MONSIEUR AND SEEMS TO BE A FAIR ONE ENOUGH
NEITHER THE COURIERS OF PARIS NOR THE COURIERS OF THE WHOLE WORLD CAN TRAVEL WITH YOUR SERVANT
IT IS BUT NATURAL
THE KING WILL YIELD HIS CONSENT AND WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE RECEIVED THE SWORD-THRUST IN DUE COURSE YOU WILL CONSIDER IN A CALMER FRAME OF MIND THE PRECEPTS OF THE GOSPEL WHICH ENJOIN FORGETFULNESS OF INJURIES AH EXCLAIMED DE WARDES FURIOUS AT THIS IMPERTURBABLE COOLNESS ONE CAN CLEARLY SEE YOU ARE HALF A BASTARD M
I CANNOT TELL IT YOU MONSIEUR SAID ARAMIS
BUT WHAT IS IT YOU ARE AIMING AT I WISH TO SEE UPON THE THRONE OF FRANCE A KING DEVOTED TO MONSIEUR FOUQUET AND I WISH MONSIEUR FOUQUET TO BE DEVOTED TO ME OH EXCLAIMED FOUQUET PRESSING HIS HAND,--"AS FOR BEING DEVOTED TO YOU I AM YOURS ENTIRELY
AH SAID ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS HEAD HERE COMES THE STORM
INQUIRE SAINT-AIGNAN THE COUNT RAN TO THE DOOR AND EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH THE USHER
DO YOU LOVE M
YOU CANNOT FORGET THAT YOUR SON IS A MAN IN THAT CASE REPLIED ATHOS DRAWING HIMSELF UP WITH STERNNESS PROVE TO ME THAT YOU ARE A MAN FOR YOU DO NOT SHOW YOURSELF A SON
WHEN THE COURTIERS NOTICED THAT THE KING HAD ONLY ADDRESSED SOME ORDINARY REMARK TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN SO PARTICULARLY NOTICED IN THE MORNING THEY IMMEDIATELY DREW THEIR OWN CONCLUSION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS COLDNESS OF MANNER
BUT WHY SO FULL OF THESE FEARS AND ANXIETIES
DE WARDES HAD FAINTED
YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF MY CONFESSION DO YOU NOT YES MONSEIGNEUR THEN GO AND FETCH ME THE SPANISH CARDINAL HERREBIA
THE KING OPENED HIS WINDOW
LET NOT DE WARDES WHO STANDS SMILING YONDER EVEN SAY A WORD ABOUT HER IN MY PRESENCE NOW GENTLEMEN EXCLAIMED THE COMTE DE GUICHE PREPARE TO START AT THIS MOMENT THE PRINCE WHO HAD COMPLETE HIS TOILETTE APPEARED AT THE WINDOW AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SALUTED BY THE ACCLAMATIONS OF ALL WHO COMPOSED THE ESCORT AND TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS BANNERS SCARFS AND FEATHERS WERE FLUTTERING AND WAVING IN THE AIR AS THE CAVALCADE GALLOPED AWAY
BUT IF AT LEAST WE DO NOT POSSESS HIS WIT AH SIRE YOU KNOW VERY WELL YOU ARE PRETENDING TO BE MODEST NO I SWEAR TO YOU
YOU ARE NOW SEVENTEEN
SHE DREW EVEN SUCH A PORTRAIT OF TYRCIS THAT TYRCIS HIMSELF WHO WAS LISTENING MUST HAVE FELT TRULY FLATTERED AT IT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS RANK AS A SHEPHERD
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO SAID BUCKINGHAM
MAID OF HONOR TO THE YOUNG MADAME REPEATED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY STILL BUT HALF CONVINCED
HE IS ON GUARD TO-DAY AT THE LOUVRE WITH THE COMPANY OF THE GENTLEMEN OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE THE KING HAD SCARCELY CEASED SPEAKING WHEN RAOUL PRESENTED HIMSELF AND ON SEEING D'ARTAGNAN SMILED ON HIM WITH THAT CHARMING SMILE WHICH IS ONLY FOUND UPON THE LIPS OF YOUTH
D'ARTAGNAN AND WHEN I WAS QUITE A CHILD HE ACQUAINTED ME WITH THE REASON FOR IT AND AS FORMING PART OF MY INHERITANCE I REGARD IT AS A PARTICULAR LEGACY BESTOWED UPON ME AND DOES THIS HATRED CONCERN M
YES IT WAS THE VERY HEIGHT OF IMPRUDENCE ON HIS PART THEN TO COME TO FONTAINEBLEAU TO SEEK THOSE WHO HAD AT PARIS SENT HIM AWAY INTO EXILE AND PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM WHOM HE HAD BEEN SEPARATED MONSIEUR MANICAMP YOU REASON LIKE PYTHAGORAS MOREOVER DE GUICHE IS AS OBSTINATE AS A MAN IN LOVE CAN BE AND HE REFUSED TO LISTEN TO ANY OF MY REMONSTRANCES
MALICORNE THEN DESCENDED THE LADDER ROUND BY ROUND REFLECTING AT EVERY STEP ON THE MEANS OF OBTAINING PIECEMEAL FROM M
AND IN WHICH COULD BE SUPPLIED NOT ONLY BOARD AND LODGING BUT ALSO ACCOMMODATION FOR EXERCISE OR OPPORTUNITIES OF SOLITUDE FOR EVEN THE WEALTHIEST COURTIERS WHENEVER AFTER HAVING RECEIVED SOME CHECK AT THE COURT THEY WISHED TO SHUT THEMSELVES UP TO THEIR OWN SOCIETY EITHER TO DEVOUR AN AFFRONT OR TO BROOD ON REVENGE
THE MOVEMENT HE MADE WAS SO MARKED THAT BAISEMEAUX NOTWITHSTANDING HIS PREOCCUPATION OBSERVED IT
PRECISELY MADAME IT IS OF FONTAINEBLEAU I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
WHENEVER YOU INTEND TO AMUSE YOURSELVES HERE INVITE ME
LET US SEE IF HIS LETTER AGREES WITH HIS WORDS THESE ARE ALMOST HIS VERY WORDS
NERVOUS AND APPARENTLY ANGRY THE YOUNG GIRL PUSHED MALICORNE AGAINST THE WALL
SPREAD OUT BEFORE HER WAS A TREASURE A MILLION WRUNG FROM HER FORTUNE AS A GLEANER PLUCKS THE BLUE CORN-FLOWER FROM HER CROWN OF FLOWERS
BUT AN ESTATE MIGHT BE PURCHASED
I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS DOES ME THE HONOR TO SAY I SAY THAT WHEN YOU ARE ALL LAUGHING TOGETHER IN MADAME'S APARTMENT HE IS AN UNWELCOME VISITOR WHO DOES NOT REMAIN OUTSIDE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS DOES NOT THINK AND DOES NOT SPEAK SO OF YOURSELF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ON MY OWN ACCOUNT THAT I DO SPEAK AND THINK
I THEREFORE WISH TO DRAW UP A COMPLETE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
SWEET LIBERTY
BAISEMEAUX ANXIOUSLY SLIPPED ANOTHER CUSHION BEHIND HIS GUEST'S BACK
IS IT ALLOWED TO PUT ANY QUESTION TO HIM AS MANY AS YOU LIKE VERY WELL
IT IS NOT ONLY HOLDING OUT YOUR HAND THAT WILL DO
DO NOT SUFFER YOURSELF TO BE DAZZLED LOUISE NOW THAT YOU ARE IN THE MIDST OF A COURT WHERE ALL THAT IS PURE TOO SOON BECOMES CORRUPT--WHERE ALL THAT IS YOUNG TOO SOON GROWS OLD
AND ADDED LOUIS AS IT SEEMS A DIFFICULT MATTER FOR YOU NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR ECONOMY TO DEFRAY WITH SO LIMITED A SUM THE EXPENSES WHICH I INTEND TO INCUR I WILL AT ONCE SIGN AN ORDER FOR THREE MILLIONS THE KING TOOK A PEN AND SIGNED AN ORDER IMMEDIATELY THEN HANDED IT TO COLBERT
A CHIEF THEY BOTH MURMURED
ONE OUGHT NOT THEREFORE TO SPEAK AT RANDOM FOR IN SUCH A CASE THE SECRET WOULD CEASE TO BE ONE HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THEN TO CONVEY YOUR SECRET INQUIRED THE DYING MONK
COLBERT IN THAT CASE SIRE I WILL PAY ALL ACCOUNTS TO-MORROW WHY SO I PROMISED THE TRADESPEOPLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS THE DAY FOLLOWING THAT ON WHICH THE BALLET SHOULD TAKE PLACE VERY WELL M
YES DUKE AND SHALL I NEVER RETURN TO FRANCE ANNE OF AUSTRIA REFLECTED FOR A MOMENT SEEMINGLY ABSORBED IN SAD AND SERIOUS THOUGHT
IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
HE THEN TURNED ROUND TO INTERROGATE MALICORNE BUT HE HAD BEEN HURRIED AWAY BY MONTALAIS AND WAS ALREADY AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THEM
MADAME PRESERVED THEREFORE AN EXCELLENT RECOLLECTION OF HIM
BEFORE LONG COMTE THE MONARCHY WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENABLE ME TO OFFER A WORTHY HOSPITALITY TO MEN OF YOUR MERIT PROVIDED SIRE A MONARCH REIGNS GRANDLY IN THE HEARTS OF HIS SUBJECTS THE PALACE HE INHABITS MATTERS LITTLE SINCE HE IS WORSHIPPED IN A TEMPLE WITH THESE WORDS ATHOS LEFT THE CABINET AND FOUND DE BRAGELONNE WHO WAS AWAITING HIM ANXIOUSLY
A VERY MASTERLY WOMAN
HE HAD DREAMED OF A PURE AFFECTION--OF AN AFFECTION FOR LOUIS THE MAN AND NOT THE SOVEREIGN--OF AN AFFECTION FREE FROM ALL SELF-INTEREST
YOU ARE A BAD AND HEARTLESS MAN M
A LITTLE WHILE AGO YOU PROMISED ME A SWORD-THRUST FROM M
IS IT NOT THAT OF A MAN OF HONOR
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE SIRE THINK NO MORE OF ME
BUT SHE HER DROOPING HEAD FALLEN FORWARD ON HER BOSOM SEEMED TO HAVE CEASED TO LIVE
I WILL CALL IT THE NAIAD AND DRYAD WHICH WILL PLEASE MADAME DO SO SAINT-AIGNAN DO SO SAID THE KING INDIFFERENTLY
QUITE FINISHED REPLIED SAINT-AIGNAN AND BUT TOO HAPPY IF I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AMUSE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS FOR A FEW MOMENTS MOMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TOO BRIEF REPLIED THE PRINCESS
AFTER THE USUAL COURTESIES HAD BEEN RENDERED AND THE CEREMONY COMPLETED THE PROCESSION SLOWLY RESUMED THE ROAD TO PARIS
NOTHING WAS WANTING BUT A QUARREL
WHEREUPON THE PROFOUNDEST SILENCE IMMEDIATELY ENSUED
SHE DISLIKED PRETENSION TOO AND NEVER OVERLOOKED THAT DEFECT EVEN IN THE KING HIMSELF
IT IS VERY OLD VOLNAY DOES THAT POOR STUDENT SELDON DRINK SUCH GOOD WINE OH NO I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY HE WAS BOARDED AT FIFTEEN FRANCS HE
LET THEM SING PROVIDED THEY PAY WHILE LOUIS XIV.'S REMARK WAS LET THEM LOOK SIGHT HAD REPLACED THE VOICE
YES VENTURED LOUISE
BUCKINGHAM SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND SAID WHEN I HIRED THESE HOUSES WHICH SURROUND THE HOTEL DE VILLE THE SQUARE WAS UNOCCUPIED
AND YET IT IS EASY ENOUGH
FROM THE WINDOWS OF THIS PART OF THE BUILDING TRAVELERS COULD PERCEIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE THE STREET WITH THE GRASS GROWING BETWEEN THE STONES WHICH WERE BEING GRADUALLY LOOSENED BY IT
MADAME MADAME HE STAMMERED OUT
I EXPECTED MORE THAN THAT WHAT DID YOU EXPECT THAT YOU WOULD SIMPLY TELL ME THAT JEALOUS PEOPLE ARE PACIFIED BY CONCEALING THE AFFECTION WHICH IS ENTERTAINED FOR THE OBJECT OF JEALOUSY DISSIMULATION IS DIFFICULT SIRE YET IT IS ONLY BE MEANS OF CONQUERING DIFFICULTIES THAT ANY HAPPINESS IS ATTAINED
HOWEVER THEIR HAIR MINGLED THEIR BREATHS UNITED AND THEIR HANDS FEVERISHLY THROBBED IN EACH OTHER'S GRASP
DE GUICHE IS AT ETAMPES NO I THOUGHT HE WAS AT PARIS
DE BAISEMEAUX THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS EXACTITUDE YOU HAVE NOT BEEN WITHOUT A LITTLE UNEASINESS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH I CERTAINLY HAVE STAMMERED OUT BAISEMEAUX
BELIEVE ME SAID THE KING I PERCEIVE OR RATHER I CAN IMAGINE YOUR UNEASINESS
I SPEAK TOO CONTINUED MADAME IN THE NAME OF THAT POOR LITTLE NAIAD WHO IS INDEED THE MOST CHARMING CREATURE I EVER MET
DO YOU BELIEVE I AM SO GREAT AN INVALID
ANNE OF AUSTRIA LOVED THE KING OR RATHER THE REGAL POWER IN HER ELDEST SON
I DID NOT KNOW YOUR LADYSHIP HAD THESE STONES WHAT IS THEIR VALUE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
WITH THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HE FARED STILL WORSE FOR THE DUKE WAS PURCHASING HORSES AFTER HORSES DIAMONDS UPON DIAMONDS
HIS LARGE EYES HOLLOWED BY SICKNESS AND INQUIETUDE SEEMED TO PERUSE IN THE VAGUE DISTANCE A MOURNFUL AND FIXED IDEA
WHAT DO YOU WISH TO BE FORGIVEN INQUIRED THE PRINCE
THE THREE YOUNG GIRLS ON THEIR SIDE HAD WITH WIDELY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WATCHED HIM DISAPPEAR
YESTERDAY IT WAS M
BUT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE SAID THE KING FAITHFUL TO THE CHARACTER HE HAD ASSUMED
RAOUL WHEN THE CHEVALIER HAD LEFT DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DISSUADE HIS FRIEND FOR HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE TROUBLE THROWN AWAY
I SEE YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO ENDURE BEING EXILED A SECOND TIME I MONSEIGNEUR I WILL NOT CARRY YOU OFF WITH US AS I HAD FIRST INTENDED WHAT WITH YOU MONSEIGNEUR YES
FILL YOURS TOO NAY NAY
IS IT NOT ODD SAID BAISEMEAUX
YOU WILL REMAIN ALOOF
UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER FOR MADAME HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN PERSONAL AFFAIRS ONLY
OF COURSE ONE HAS ALWAYS FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS
THEY WERE LEFT ALONE A WHOLE WEEK TO WEARY THEMSELVES AT THEIR EASE
ONE WORD MORE SAID FOUQUET
THE BATH
IT IS A CIPHER CONTINUED THE LATTER WHICH YOU USED IN 1655 AND WHICH YOUR SECRETARY JUAN JUJAN WHO IS DEAD COULD ALONE DECIPHER IF HE WERE RESTORED TO LIFE YOU KNEW THIS CIPHER THEN IT WAS I WHO TAUGHT IT HIM SAID ARAMIS BOWING WITH A GRACEFULNESS FULL OF RESPECT AND ADVANCING TOWARDS THE DOOR AS IF TO LEAVE THE ROOM
THE CHEVALIER WHILE ADMIRING DE GUICHE'S PENETRATION WAS LEADING HIM BLINDFOLDED TO THE BRINK OF THE PRECIPICE
AND MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS IS BY NO MEANS A VERY CONSCIENTIOUS GARRISON SAID HE TO HIMSELF SIGHING ALOUD
WILL YOU ACCEPT THE GOLD OF THE SETTINGS IN RETURN FOR A SUM OF READY MONEY TO BE PLACED IN MY HANDS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
DE BAISEMEAUX WILL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE ME
HERE ARE THEIR NAMES I WILL SEE THAT THE SENTENCE BE CARRIED OUT LASTLY THERE IS A LADY AT ANVERS GRAND-NIECE OF RAVAILLAC
BELIEVE ME THAT WHEN I ASK YOU A QUESTION IT IS NOT FROM CURIOSITY ALONE BUT REALLY BECAUSE THE POSITION IS A CRITICAL ONE
COLBERT INHERITED FROM M
IN THEIR STIFLED LAUGHTER AND IN THE LITTLE RETICENCES OF THEIR SARDONIC HUMOR MONSIEUR THE POOR ABSENTEE WAS NOT SPARED
BUT SO LONG AS YOU KEEP NEAR ME HE WILL NOT VENTURE TO KEEP AWAY FROM YOU TO WHOM BESIDES HE IS MOST WARMLY AND AFFECTIONATELY ATTACHED
SAINT-AIGNAN ALONE TOOK THE PATH WHICH LED TOWARDS THESE BUILDINGS
THE VALET AND NURSE DIED THE SAME DAY WELL AND BY POISON
LET US WALK ARM IN ARM TOWARDS THOSE LARGE TREES
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO SIGN NOTHING WHATEVER MONSIEUR ONLY IT WOULD BE VERY KIND IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO WRITE TO THE KING TO WHOM I BELONG AND SOLICIT HIS MAJESTY'S PERMISSION FOR ME TO MARRY MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WELL THOUGHT RAOUL
YOU ARE THEREFORE HE WHO WAS FORMERLY CALLED ARAMIS AND SINCE THE CHEVALIER D'HERBLAY
BUT ON THIS OCCASION WHILE TAKING EVERY CARE OF HIS CONSTITUTION HE DID AMPLE JUSTICE TO BAISEMEAUX'S BREAKFAST WHICH IN ALL RESPECTS WAS MOST EXCELLENT
PRAY DO NOT THINK OF FIGHTING GENTLEMEN SAID MANICAMP BEFORE YOU HAVE RESTED YOURSELVES
GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT-AIGNAN AND VILLEROY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
PERFECTLY SO
PERFECTLY SO
LOUISE PITIED M
THE PRESENTATIONS WERE SOON OVER
I VENTURE THEREFORE TO ADDRESS THIS NOTE TO YOUR MAJESTY
TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL AGITATE HIS MAJESTY TOO MUCH
HE WOULD HAVE BESTOWED A TREASURE UPON A BEGGAR HAD ONE STOOD BEFORE HIM TO SECURE HIM UNINTERRUPTED INDULGENCE IN HIS DREAMS
I HAVE THEREFORE MADE UP MY MIND TO GIVE WAY TO THE FAVORITE WHOSE HAPPINESS I ENVY EVEN WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE MY SINCERE FRIENDSHIP AND SINCERE ADMIRATION FOR HIM
AND COLBERT COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS DELIGHT
OR RATHER IN THE PRINCE'S HOUSEHOLD IN THE PRINCE'S HOUSEHOLD SAID DE WARDES LOOKING UP WITH AN AIR OF CONSIDERATION LET ME SEE--THE APPOINTMENT OF THE MASTER OF THE HORSE IS VACANT I BELIEVE OH SAID MALICORNE THERE IS NO QUESTION OF SUCH A POST AS THAT MONSIEUR
I AM NOT ALTOGETHER UNHAPPY MANICAMP WHO WAS FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND DE GUICHE AND WHO DID NOT LOSE A WORD OF WHAT THE PRINCE WAS SAYING BENT DOWN TO HIS VERY SHOULDERS OVER HIS HORSE'S NECK IN ORDER TO CONCEAL THE LAUGHTER HE COULD NOT REPRESS
THE PRINCESS WAS DANCING ROUND HIM WITH A RESPONSIVE SMILE AND THE SAME AIR OF ALLURING SEDUCTIVENESS
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THAT MAN TO DEPART TOBY YES
BY THE BY SHE IS OF GENTLE BIRTH SHE BELONGS TO A VERY GOOD FAMILY AND IS MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME THAT'S WELL
CHAPTER VIII
SAINT-AIGNAN WAS THE VERY MAN WHOM MADAME NEEDED IN HER THEN STATE OF MIND
IF ANY ONE MADAME HAD HAD THE BOLDNESS TO NOTICE IN ME THAT WHICH I DO NOT MYSELF WISH TO BEHOLD WHAT WOULD YOU DO DUKE THERE ARE SECRETS WHICH KILL THOSE WHO DISCOVER THEM HE THEN WHO HAS DISCOVERED YOUR SECRET MADMAN THAT YOU ARE STILL LIVES
I FEEL I HAVE OFFENDED YOU SIRE
IS THAT ALL HE SAID
CURIOUS TO LEARN WHY AND PARTICULARLY WHAT ABOUT THIS MAN AND WOMAN WERE CONVERSING AT SUCH AN HOUR AND IN SUCH A SINGULAR POSITION SAINT-AIGNAN MADE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS HE POSSIBLY COULD AND APPROACHED ALMOST UNDER THE ROUNDS OF THE LADDER
WE ARE ALL LISTENING TO YOU WELL MONSIEUR IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF A PERSONAL INJURY TOWARDS MYSELF BUT ONE TOWARDS MY FATHER THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY STATED YES
OH FORGIVE ME MURMURED THE YOUNG MAN SINKING AT ONCE FROM THE LOFTY TONE HE HAD ASSUMED
HE EMBARKS ON HIS OWN PROJECT THAT OF RESTORING CHARLES II TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND AND WITH THE HELP OF ATHOS SUCCEEDS EARNING HIMSELF QUITE A FORTUNE IN THE PROCESS
MADAME YES AND YOU CAN FIND IT AGAIN WITH MY EYES SHUT VERY WELL
THEY WERE SOON ENGAGED IN QUEST OF APARTMENTS
WHILE THE BOAT WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THE SHORE THE DUKE KEPT HIS EYES IMMOVABLY FIXED ON THE ADMIRAL'S SHIP LIKE A MISER TORN AWAY FROM HIS COFFERS OR A MOTHER SEPARATED FROM HER CHILD ABOUT TO BE LEAD AWAY TO DEATH
HOW DO YOU DO MONSIEUR MANICAMP HOW IS THIS VICOMTE YOU ARE LEAVING US YES A MISSION FROM THE KING WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LONDON
FOUQUET WAS STILL DELIGHTEDLY INHALING THE PERFUME OF HIS EPISTLE
I SAID THAT I LOVED YOU AND IT IS TRUE
I DO NOT WISH TO BE CONQUERED IN ELEGANCE BY AN ENGLISHMAN MY DEAR COUNT SAID MANICAMP ELEGANCE IS NOT A COSTLY COMMODITY IT IS ONLY A VERY DIFFICULT ACCOMPLISHMENT YES BUT DIFFICULT THINGS COST A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAVE ONLY GOT SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A VERY EMBARRASSING STATE OF THINGS TRULY SAID DE WARDES
DURING THIS PROSTRATION OF MIND AND STRENGTH THE PURSE OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE WAS GETTING FULL AGAIN AND WHEN ONCE FILLED OVERFLOWED INTO THAT OF DE MANICAMP WHO BOUGHT NEW CLOTHES DRESSED HIMSELF AGAIN AND RECOMMENCED THE SAME LIFE HE HAD FOLLOWED BEFORE
EVERY NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED AT ARAMIS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE DEEPEST GRATITUDE
LET US FINISH THIS HE SAID
THAT I WERE A MAN WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO ME I WOULD STRANGLE YOU AH
THE REPUTATION OF AN HONEST INN LIKE THAT OF THE BEAU PAON WAS CONCERNED IN NOT ALLOWING ITS VISITORS TO BE ROBBED
AND SHE OPENED ONE OF HER JEWEL-BOXES
MADEMOISELLE--I HAVE SEEN YOU--AND YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN I THINK YOU VERY BEAUTIFUL
IF YOUR JEALOUS HUSBAND HAS THREE MOUTHS COMTE GET THREE CAKES MANICAMP I CAN GET SUCH ADVICE AS THAT FROM M
DOES IT SMOKE NEVER MONSIEUR YOU WERE SAYING JUST NOW SAID THE GOVERNOR RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO BE HAPPY IN PRISON
THE FLOCK BELONGING TO THIS PASTOR NEEDED HIS RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION
COME TAKE COURAGE IN FACT MADAME WHAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE TO SAY MUST BE KEPT A PROFOUND SECRET
PRESENT YOURSELF THEREFORE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO MADAME AND FOR OUR SAKES TREAT THIS ALLY WITH CONSIDERATION BUT SAID FOUQUET ARE YOU QUITE SURE THAT IT IS UPON HER THAT THE KING HAS HIS EYES FIXED AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IF THE NEEDLE HAS TURNED IT MUST BE SINCE THE MORNING
FOR NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE THAT THE FRENCH GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS TO SETTLE WITH HIS GRACE OTHER THAN THOSE OF FRIENDSHIP
CHAPTER II
TRY TO SEE HIM IN THE SAME WAY I TRIED TO SEE YOU
D'HERBLAY I PROMISE YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT SIRE I WILL NOT FORGET YOU ARAMIS BOWED AND THE KING ALSO BOWED TO HIM IN A RESPECTFUL MANNER AS HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO TOWARDS WOMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH
I CAN ONLY WONDER THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO RIDICULE SO CLEVERLY AND WITH SUCH AUDACITY BY THESE YOUNG GIRLS
LET ME BE PUNISHED--CUT OFF THE HAND WHICH WROTE IT I WILL WORK WITH THE OTHER--BUT RESTORE MY MOTHER TO ME MY BOY SAID BAISEMEAUX YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IT DOES NOT DEPEND UPON ME
BAISEMEAUX HABITUATED TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS PRISONER DID NOT SEEM TO SHARE ANY OF THE SENSATIONS WHICH ARAMIS EXPERIENCED BUT WITH ALL THE ZEAL OF A GOOD SERVANT HE BUSIED HIMSELF IN ARRANGING ON THE TABLE THE PASTY AND CRAWFISH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
HE THOUGHT TOO THAT SAINT-AIGNAN IN DRAWING THE PORTRAITS WOULD FIND A MEANS OF INSINUATING SOME FLATTERING ALLUSIONS WHICH WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO THE EARS OF ONE HIS MAJESTY WAS INTERESTED IN PLEASING
I AM TREATING MYSELF TO SOME MUSIC REPLIED THE PRINCE GNASHING HIS TEETH
AND I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND HOW THE PEOPLE YOU ATTACK MUST ADORE YOU AND IS THAT THE REASON WHY YOU SIRE WHOM I HAD REGARDED AS MY DEFENDER ARE ABOUT TO JOIN THESE WHO PERSECUTE ME SAID MADAME
BUT BY WHAT HAPPY CHANCE AH
AND IT IS MINE TOO AND SHE SEEMS TO BE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER ON THAT IS A MATTER OF COURSE
MOREOVER THERE ARE NO ENMITIES SO BITTER THAT THEY CANNOT BE WASHED AWAY BY BLOOD BY A GOOD SWORD-THRUST LOYALLY GIVEN LISTEN TO ME MY DEAR DE GUICHE THIS INVETERATE DISLIKE EXISTED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND M
IT IS HE WHO AND BAISEMEAUX APPROACHED ARAMIS'S EAR MAKING A SORT OF EAR-TRUMPET OF HIS HANDS AND WHISPERED
FOOL FOOL THAT I AM
AND HE ADMITTED I WAS RIGHT AND RESIGNED HIMSELF UNRESISTINGLY TO MY ARGUMENTS DE GUICHE WHO HAD HITHERTO SAT LEANING FORWARD WHILE RAOUL WAS SPEAKING DREW HIMSELF UP HIS EYES GLANCING PROUDLY
CHEVALIER SAID GUICHE YOUR CONDUCT IS UNGENEROUS
REALLY YOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY INDISCREET AT THIS REMARK MALICORNE BIT HIS LIPS AND RETIRED A FEW STEPS WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPLY
THE PUBLIC IS NOT SO FATUOUS AS THEY SEEM THE KING WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT MADAME WAS AN ANGEL FOR SENSE AND THE VERY REVERSE FOR CLEVERNESS
IT WAS THE CLERK TOO WHO TOLD THE COACHMAN WHO WAS VERY PROUD OF HAVING A MARQUISE TO DRIVE TO TAKE THE ROAD TO SAINT-MANDE
CHAPTER LIV
IT WAS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE QUEEN AND IN THE PRESENCE OF ONE PERSON ONLY THAT THE KING YOU PERCEIVE THAT I DO KNOW IT
THE YOUNG DUKE PASSED HIS HANDKERCHIEF ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD WHICH WAS COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION
MADAME THAT WOULD INDEED BE AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE FOR THOSE WHO UNLIKE YOUR LADYSHIP MIGHT NOT BE IN POSITION TO KEEP THEIR PLATE
I WANTED TO SEE YOU AH GREAT NEED OF THAT NOT AS FAR AS CONCERNS YOURSELF PERHAPS BUT AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I HAVE LEFT MY HOME AND THAT FOR THE FUTURE I HAVE NO OTHER PLACE OF RESIDENCE THAN THAT WHICH YOU MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE
MY OWN LETTERS IS IT POSSIBLE HE SAID TURNING PALE
YES WHAT IS IT HE ASKED
DE GUICHE ALTHOUGH BLUSHING SCARLET PUT A GOOD COUNTENANCE ON THE MATTER
DE GUICHE OBSERVING MADAME TURN PALE AND GUESSING THE CAUSE OF HER CHANGE OF COLOR ABRUPTLY QUITTED THE ASSEMBLY AND DISAPPEARED
MADAME ADDED SAINT-AIGNAN AT PRESENT IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION WHAT THE WATER-NYMPHS HAVE TO SAY
COLBERT THEN YES SIRE I PRAISE HIM
BUT I ENTREAT YOU HENRIETTA TO BEGIN BY CHOOSING THE LEAST OF YOUR EVILS
WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT LANDED PROPERTY A WOMAN CANNOT LIVE AT COURT
YOU WISHED FOR AN EXPLANATION M
NOW FOR THE CARDINAL HE SAID
MADAME HAD RECEIVED BUCKINGHAM'S SMILES AND ATTENTIONS AND SIGHS WHILE HE WAS PRESENT
BUT THAT SHE WAS OF A PROUD IMPETUOUS CHARACTER AND THAT HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES WERE SO ACUTE AS TO REQUIRE VERY CAREFUL MANAGEMENT
YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT HOW EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING SAID THE KING
BUT WHOSE FAULT WAS IT SAID DE GUICHE PRETENDING TO SPEAK IN AN ANGRY TONE
WHO WAS IT THAT HAD SOUGHT HER IN THE EARLIEST MOMENTS OF HER MARRIED LIFE TO WHISPER WORDS OF LOVE IN HER EAR
FOR IT WAS NOW FAIRLY DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT NO SYMPATHETIC CURRENT HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF HURRYING HIS HEART AWAY IN ITS COURSE BECAUSE THERE HAD BEEN NO CONFESSION OF LOVE IN THE CASE--BECAUSE THE CONFESSION WAS IN FACT AN INSULT TOWARDS THE MAN AND TOWARDS THE SOVEREIGN
IN FACT RESUMED SAINT-AIGNAN YOUR MAJESTY WILL GRANT AN AUDIENCE
THE LOOKS OF BOTH PRINCESSES SIMULTANEOUSLY FELL UPON LA VALLIERE WHO AS WE HAVE JUST SAID WAS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED AT THAT MOMENT
FROM THE MOMENT OF THAT EXCITED CONVERSATION THE TWO YOUNG MEN HAD HELD IN FRONT OF THE TENTS AT LE HAVRE WHEN RAOUL MADE THE DUKE PERCEIVE THE IMPROPRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT BUCKINGHAM FELT HIMSELF ATTRACTED TOWARDS RAOUL ALMOST IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
D'ARTAGNAN VERY WELL
IS THAT YOU DE WARDES?--WHAT
BUT RAOUL CALCULATES WELL
AND TONNAY-CHARENTE WOULD TELL YOU AS I DO IF SHE WERE HERE
MALICORNE AWAY WITH YOU AT THE SAME TIME SAID MONTALAIS
I KNOW BOTH YOUR HEART AND YOUR MIND
AND WHICH HE HALF DREW FROM HIS BREAST
ARAMIS WHO PROBABLY HAD LEARNT ALL THAT HE CARED TO KNOW REPLIED WHEN YOU LIKE THE YOUNG MAN SAW THEM PREPARE TO LEAVE AND SALUTED THEM POLITELY
AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT NOT TOO DARK I FEEL CONFIDENCE IN YOUR MAJESTY ON THAT HEAD SAID D'ARTAGNAN BOWING AND NOW YOU ARE RIGHT MONSIEUR
ABSOLUTELY ALL SIRE
TO THIS REMARK MANICAMP DEEP IN THOUGHT HAD REPLIED QUITE TRUE THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW TO FILL IT MALICORNE ADDED
AND WOE TO HIM WHO MAY FAIL IN HIS IN CRITICISING HIS SOVEREIGN'S CONDUCT IN FACT AT THIS MOMENT A FEW EAGER AND CURIOUS FACES WERE SEEN IN THE WALK AS IF ENGAGED IN A SEARCH
BECAUSE THERE IS RESEMBLANCE AND RESEMBLANCE
WHEREUPON THE SENTINEL CALLED TO AN OFFICER OF LOWER GRADE WHO WAS WALKING ABOUT IN A TOLERABLY SPACIOUS COURTYARD AND WHO IN TURN ON BEING INFORMED OF HIS OBJECT RAN TO SEEK ONE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF
OH BEAUTIFUL WALK
YES YOU ARE RIGHT THE HORSE SHALL BE TAKEN TO THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE
I WILL GRANT THIS DALEY DARLEY DAWLEY OR WHATEVER YOU CALL HIM A PENSION FOR HIS APHORISM
THE NOISE SUMMONED EVERY ONE TO THE VARIOUS DOORS
BESIDES THAT GOOD FELLOW BAISEMEAUX HAS NOT A COURTIER'S HEART
ONE OF MADAME'S MAIDS OF HONOR THAT MUST BE THE ONE WELL WHAT THEN WELL MONSEIGNEUR IT IS TO THAT YOUNG GIRL THAT YOU MUST PAY YOUR VISIT THIS EVENING BAH
FOR IF SO MANY A SWORD WOULD BE UNSHEATHED IN THIS COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT FEAR ENGLISH STEEL BUT AFTER ALL SAID MANICAMP I HAVE HAD NO SATISFACTORY PROOF GIVEN ME OF THE LOVE IN QUESTION AND IT MAY BE NO MORE THAN AN IDLE TALE NO NO SAID DE GUICHE IT MUST BE THE TRUTH AND DESPITE HIS COMMAND OVER HIMSELF HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH
HIS EVERY THOUGHT WAS A REMEMBRANCE OF HER--HIS EVERY MEMORY A REGRET
SUCH MADAME IS WHAT THE DRYAD RELATED TO ME
AS TO MONTALAIS AS HER SOLE REPLY SHE DREW THE BREVET FROM HER POCKET AND SHOWED IT TO THE OLD LADY
WE MISSED YOU THIS EVENING AND A GOOD MANY INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT YOU
HERE IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE FIRST TWO NOVELS
A PARDON PRONOUNCED BY YOUR LIPS IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ME AND I NEED THE FORGIVENESS OF YOUR HEART AND MIND UPON MY HONOR MONSIEUR SAID LA VALLIERE I ASSURE YOU MOST POSITIVELY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING AGAIN THAT IS A DELICACY ON YOUR PART WHICH CHARMS ME REPLIED FOUQUET AND I SEE YOU DO NOT WISH ME TO BLUSH BEFORE YOU BLUSH
AND HIS RESPECTFULLY ATTENTIVE MANNER SERVED TO SUSTAIN THE YOUNG GIRL IN THE MIDST OF THE VARIED EMOTIONS THAT VISIBLY AGITATED HER
THE WIND WAS BLOWING STRONGLY FROM THE HARBOR AND MOANING IN FITFUL GUSTS
FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE FINE TUNIC OF THE HUNTRESS HER ROUND AND DELICATE KNEE CAN BE SEEN
NO GUARDS NO DRUMS NO NOISE AT ALL IF I WERE NOT TO LEAVE MY CLOAK HERE SAID ARAMIS PRETENDING TO BE ALARMED I SHOULD REALLY THINK I WAS GOING TO PRISON ON MY OWN ACCOUNT THE JAILER PRECEDED THE GOVERNOR ARAMIS WALKING ON HIS RIGHT HAND
WHY NOT WHEN MADAME GOES TO THE BATHS WITH THE KING AND DOES NOT DO ME THE HONOR TO EVEN INVITE ME
I HAVE LIVED LONG MY LORD VERY LONG FOR A WOMAN AND I CONFESS TO YOU THAT NOT A YEAR HAS PASSED I HAVE NOT REGRETTED SPAIN NOT ONE YEAR MADAME SAID THE YOUNG DUKE COLDLY
A SAD MISFORTUNE FOR ME MONSIEUR LE COMTE SAID MALICORNE CHANGING COLOR
AND WAS IT FOR HER BY AN EXCESS OF ZEAL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISINTERPRETED TO CHECK AT THE RISK OF INCREASING IT THE IMPERTINENCE OF THEIR CONDUCT
BUT BUT MADAME
I HAVE DONE NOTHING FOR THE LAST HOUR SAID RAOUL RISING FROM THE GROUND BUT SAY THE SAME THING THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE DUKE HE SAID I ENTREAT YOU TO BE SILENT ABOUT THIS AFFAIR
AT FIRST THERE WAS WRITTEN
YES SIRE SHE DID SO
I DO MY LORD WELL YOU SHALL HAVE IT
FOR A DISTICH DO YOU KNOW THAT HE MADE THIS DISTICH AGAINST THE JESUITS THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
DID HE REALLY LOVE HER
WE HAVE SOME CLEVER PEOPLE IN LONDON SIRE AND THOSE CLEVER PEOPLE PRODUCE ADORABLE PUPILS
DE BRAGELONNE WEAR A CUIRASS DE WARDES CLENCHED HIS HANDS
IN A CORNER OF THE CABINET THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WAS EXTENDED FULL LENGTH UPON SOME CUSHIONS HAVING JUST HAD HIS LONG HAIR CURLED WITH WHICH HE WAS PLAYING IN THE SAME MANNER A WOMAN WOULD HAVE DONE
BUT THAT WHICH WAS NOT JUST WAS THAT WHEN IN ENGLAND THIS WOMAN BY HER SEDUCTIONS COMPLETELY ENSLAVED A YOUNG MAN IN THE SERVICE OF LORD DE WINTER BY NAME FELTON
TELL ME HAVE YOU FAITH IN YOUR GOOD STAR NO REPLIED FOUQUET DEJECTEDLY
I HAVE EVEN TO REPROACH MYSELF THAT I DID NOT ON THAT OCCASION PAY HER THE ATTENTION SHE DESERVED OH SIRE
LOUIS ROSE TO RECEIVE HIM
THE KING HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HIS MOTHER FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS
YOU ARE MAKING ME A POSITIVE PRESENT COMTE I BELIEVE SO MONSEIGNEUR WELL GO AND ANNOUNCE TO YOUR M
IN FACT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO PERCEIVE THAT HIS MOST DEVOTED ATTENTION AWAKENED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND THAT THE GRACE WITH WHICH HE RODE ONE OF HIS MOST FIERY HORSES WAS THROWN AWAY FOR IT WAS ONLY CASUALLY AND BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT THAT THE PRINCESS'S EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS HIM
LISTEN TO ME SIRE CONTINUED THE YOUNG WOMAN ACQUIRING BY DEGREES THAT ASCENDENCY OVER HER INTERROGATOR WHICH HER BEAUTY AND HER NERVOUS NATURE CONFERRED
A THOROUGH COQUETTE
THE DUKE IS NOW PLAYING CARDS WITH THE KING
WHO WILL SAVE HER
THE ONE WAS THE SHEPHERD TYRCIS THE OWNER OF EXTENSIVE DOMAINS TRANSMITTED TO HIM FROM HIS PARENTS BY RIGHT OF INHERITANCE
THE GOVERNOR TURNED TOWARD ARAMIS AND SPEAKING IN SUCH A TONE THAT THE SENTINELS COULD NOT LOSE A WORD HE OBSERVED,--"I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY MONSIEUR WHY INQUIRED ARAMIS
WELL LOUISE SAID THE KING IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE DO YOU STILL THREATEN ME WITH THE ANGER OF HEAVEN
I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WOULD IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING BETWEEN US
SHE WAS CALLED THE FLEMISH LADY
AND NOW THAT MY OWN AFFAIRS ARE SETTLED I AM GOING TO TRY AND ASCERTAIN WHAT THE AFFAIRS ARE IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN IS ENGAGED YOUR OWN AFFAIRS ARE SETTLED YOU SAY YES YOU ARE VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT CASE THEN AND I SHOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY THE SAME I HOPE YOU DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY HUM NOTHING COULD BE BETTER THAN THE KING'S RECEPTION OF YOU TRUE AND COLBERT LEAVES YOU IN PEACE NEARLY SO IN THAT CASE SAID ARAMIS WITH THAT CONNECTION OF IDEAS WHICH MARKED HIM IN THAT CASE THEN WE CAN BESTOW A THOUGHT UPON THE YOUNG GIRL I WAS SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT YESTERDAY WHOM DO YOU MEAN WHAT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALREADY
WHILST AT THE SAME TIME OTHER WORKMEN ILLUMINATED THE THEATER AND THE SHORES OF THE LAKE WITH AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER OF LAMPS
OUT WITH IT RATTLE AWAY BAISEMEAUX
THIS IS INDEED AN ADVENTURE
BUT BETWEEN HER LOOKS AND MINE A SHADOW INTERVENED
IT HAS ALWAYS THE SEMBLANCE OF SECURITY THE KING KNELT UPON A FOOTSTOOL AND TOOK MADAME'S HAND
I HAVE THEREFORE A SLIGHT SERVICE TO ASK OF YOU WHAT MAY THAT BE THAT YOU WILL OFFER ME YOUR ARM AND GUIDE ME YOURSELF LIKE ANOTHER LIKE ANOTHER--I USED TO KNOW MYTHOLOGY BUT OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS HAVE MADE ME FORGET IT
EVERY NOW AND THEN MONSIEUR RAISED HIS EYES TO THE CEILING THEN LOWERED THEM TOWARDS THE SLICES OF PATE WHICH THE CHEVALIER WAS ATTACKING AND FINALLY NOT CARING TO BETRAY THE RESENTMENT HE GESTICULATED IN A MANNER WHICH HARLEQUIN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
HE HAD REMARKED THE PRINCE AND THE CHEVALIER TOGETHER AND FULL OF ANXIOUS ATTENTION HE SEEMED TO TRY AND GUESS THE NATURE OF THE REMARKS WHICH THEY HAD JUST EXCHANGED
NO HE WAS A PHILOSOPHER OR RATHER HE HAD THE INDIFFERENCE THE APATHY THE OBSTINACY WHICH BANISH FROM MAN EVERY SENTIMENT OF THE SUPERNATURAL
YOU ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU MAY HAVE SAID UNDER THE OAK
THESE GENTLEMEN HOWEVER WHOM I RECOMMEND AS AN EXAMPLE FOR MY OFFICERS TO FOLLOW CAN HARDLY BE SO FOR THESE LADIES MADAME GLANCED AT THE COMTE DE GUICHE AND PERCEIVED THAT HIS FACE WAS BURNING WITH CONFUSION
THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE IS THE FINAL VOLUME OF D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
I DON'T EAT GOVERNORS OF THE BASTILE RAW HEAVEN BE PRAISED COME INTO THE COURTYARD WITH ME
DICTATE AN ORDER FOR A PLACE IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF MONSIEUR OH SAID MANICAMP LAYING DOWN THE PEN A PLACE IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF MONSIEUR FOR FIFTY PISTOLES YOU MISTOOK ME MY FRIEND
WHAT MATTERS BEING PRESENT OR ABSENT SINCE YOU EXPECT NOTHING FROM HER
TOBY SAID FOUQUET SEND TOBY THE VALET AGAIN SHUT THE DOOR
WE MUST PREVENT THAT WHY BECAUSE IF M
POOR FELLOW
AURE YOUR FORTUNE AND OUR FUTURE ARE STANDING AT YOUR ELBOW YES WAS HER REPLY AS SHE TENDERLY EMBRACED LA VALLIERE WHOM INWARDLY SHE WAS TEMPTED TO STRANGLE
NAY LISTEN FURTHER SHE CONTINUED
IS YOUR MAJESTY UNWELL INQUIRED SAINT-AIGNAN STRETCHING FORWARD HIS ARMS
IN TRUTH IT IS JUST SO WITH ME
LA VALLIERE LOOKED AFTER HIM SAYING,--"YES YES HE TOO IS SUFFERING AND I BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN HER COMPANIONS MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS AND MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE RAN FORWARD
ALL THESE MOTIVES GAVE THE LOVER THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE HUSBAND
THE DOWRY
TAKE THEM THANK YOU MONSIEUR
DO YOU WISH TO KNOW ANYTHING ELSE THE LAST WORD OF THE COUPLET STILL REMAINS LA VALLIERE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN RESUMING THE SMILE THAT SO TORMENTED GUICHE
FOR YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID
TO MAKE YOU SUPERINTENDENT OF MY FINANCES
BUT WHO SAYS YOU ARE DRIVEN AWAY OR THAT YOU ARE EXILED
IN THE NEXT PLACE--FOR YOU DID NOT ALLOW ME TO FINISH WHAT I WAS SAYING--THE PUBLIC DOES NOT ASSERT THAT YOU HAVE ABANDONED YOURSELF TO THIS PASSION
YOU ARE MY FRIEND AND I AM AFRAID I SHOULD NOT ADVISE YOU AS YOU WOULD LIKE AH
AND THE LOOKS OF BOTH WOMEN MET EACH OTHER LIKE TWO RESISTLESS SWORDS
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SWEAR I WILL GIVE THE LIE TO THOSE WHO ARE JEALOUS OF ME BY PRETENDING TO TREAT YOU LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN A BAD AS WELL AS UNSAFE MEANS SAID THE YOUNG PRINCESS SHAKING HER PRETTY HEAD
IT WAS LITTLE WORTHY OF A MOST GALLANT COURT
I AM ACTING ON BEHALF OF ONE OF MY FRIENDS AH
PERHAPS HE SAW THE CRIMINALS AND IT WAS FEARED THAT HE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING THE DEUCE
I WOULD HAVE OBTAINED A WIFE FOR YOU FROM THE FIRST RANKS OF THE RICH NOBILITY
THE GIRL WILL GET HOLD OF THE KING AND MADAME'S SECRET AND YOU CAN SCARCELY PREDICT WHAT A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE CAN DO WITH A SECRET BUT HOW TO GET AT HER NAY YOU OF ALL MEN TO ASK ME SUCH A QUESTION SAID ARAMIS
BUT YOUR MAJESTY DID NOT TELL ME TO REMAIN THE KING PERCEIVED THAT TIME WAS PASSING AWAY THAT IF THIS STRANGE SCENE WERE PROLONGED IT WOULD COMPLICATE EVERYTHING AND THAT A SINGLE CLOUD UPON THE PICTURE WOULD EVENTUALLY SPOIL THE WHOLE
THE POOR MEN WHO WERE HUNG SIRE WERE NEITHER YOUR ENEMIES NOR MINE
IF ANY ONE WERE TO SEE ME I DECLARE I SHOULD DIE OF VERY SHAME OH
MADAME KNEW NOT WHAT PITY WAS AND SAID TO THE QUEEN-MOTHER AS SHE TURNED TOWARDS HER IF FORTUNE WERE JUST SHE WOULD FAVOR THAT POOR LA VALLIERE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE SAID THE QUEEN-MOTHER SMILING
OLD AND CORPULENT COURTIERS WERE SEEN RUNNING AFTER BUTTERFLIES LOSING THEIR HATS AS THEY RAN AND WITH THEIR RAISED CANES CUTTING DOWN THE MYRTLES AND THE FURZE AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SPANIARDS
I AM NOT ANGRY
MADAME THEREFORE WHO HAD A WELL-DISGUISED PLAN IN HER MIND OF CONSTITUTING HERSELF THE SECOND IF NOT EVEN THE PRINCIPAL QUEEN OF THE COURT RENDERED HER RECEPTIONS DELIGHTFUL TO ALL FROM THE CONVERSATION THE OPPORTUNITIES OF MEETING AND THE PERFECT LIBERTY SHE ALLOWED EVERY ONE OF MAKING ANY REMARK HE PLEASED ON THE CONDITION HOWEVER THAT THE REMARK WAS AMUSING OR SENSIBLE
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE TEARS AND SOBS OF A WOMAN RUN SAID THE KING
LET US AVAIL OURSELVES OF IT YES LET US TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT FOR THIS EVENING I COULD DIVULGE THE SOFTEST SECRETS OF MY HEART AH IF M
WHAT SAID HE IN A TONE WHICH NOTHING CAN DESCRIBE IS THAT YOU AGAIN DEAR FRIEND HUMPH
BAISEMEAUX ENTERED FIRST AND OPENED THE SECOND DOOR HIMSELF
YOUR SERVANTS APPROACH
IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT WITH REGARD TO DANCING CONCERTS AND PROMENADES AND SUCH MATTERS A WOMAN IS FAR STRONGER THAN THE MOST ROBUST OF PORTERS
A MAID OF HONOR CRIED THE OLD LADY LIFTING HER HANDS TOWARDS HEAVEN
AN UNHAPPY DYING MAN NOTHING OF THE KIND--AS BRISK AND VIGOROUS A YOUNG FELLOW AS EVER LIVED MELANCHOLY AND ILL-TEMPERED THEN NOT AT ALL
AND AFTER SERIOUS REFLECTION IT SEEMED AS IF THE CLEVER SUBTLE MIND OF HER FRIEND FULL OF EXPERIENCE AND SOUND JUDGMENT ANSWERED HER IN THE WELL-REMEMBERED IRONICAL TONES
COME HE SAID COME
FOUQUET DECIDEDLY MARQUISE YOU HAVE MADE ME REFLECT
I SHALL HAVE WORKED FOR THREE YEARS AND GIVEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS FOR NOTHING ABSOLUTELY FOR NOTHING AT ALL DEAR M
THE ADMIRAL SEATED HIMSELF AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE PRINCESS AND PLACED THE COMTE DE GUICHE ON HER LEFT
WHENEVER HE MOUNTS AND EXERCISES HIS HORSE IN THE BEAUTIFUL PLAINS OF HIS INHERITANCE OR WHENEVER HE JOINS WITH THE SHEPHERDS WHO OWE HIM ALLEGIANCE IN DIFFERENT GAMES OF SKILL AND STRENGTH ONE MIGHT SAY THAT IT IS THE GOD MARS HURLING HIS LANCE ON THE PLAINS OF THRACE OR EVEN BETTER THAT IT WAS APOLLO HIMSELF THE GOD OF DAY RADIANT UPON EARTH BEARING HIS FLAMING DARTS IN HIS HAND EVERY ONE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS ALLEGORICAL PORTRAIT OF THE KING WAS NOT THE WORST EXORDIUM THE NARRATOR COULD HAVE CHOSEN
VERY TRUE
HE IMMEDIATELY UTTERED ALMOST A SHOUT OF DELIGHT AND GOT OUT OR RATHER DARTED OUT OF HIS CARRIAGE RUNNING TOWARDS ARAMIS WHOSE HANDS HE SEIZED MAKING A THOUSAND APOLOGIES
AT ALL EVENTS YOU HAVE NOW RETURNED AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE CHEVALIER WILL BECOME AMIABLE AGAIN HOW SO MONSEIGNEUR
I ASSURE YOU I WAS GOING TO DOES THE GOVERNOR STILL INTEND TO GO TO M
BANDS OF GAY MUSIC GREETED HER ARRIVAL AND ACCOMPANIED HER EVERY STEP SHE TOOK
REMARKING THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT QUITE CONVINCED AND RECEIVED THE WARNING AS AN IDLE THREAT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED LEISURELY TOWARDS THE TABLE UPON WHICH LAY A WRITING-CASE AND A PEN THE LENGTH OF WHICH WOULD HAVE TERRIFIED THE TOPOGRAPHICAL PORTHOS
THE UNLUCKY MALICORNE ALMOST CRUSHED HER BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE DOOR SHE WAS COMING IN AT
YOU ARE NO TRUE WOMAN I AM SURE YES I AM INDEED REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITH AN ACCENT OF THE MOST CHARMING MELANCHOLY
FIX IT YOURSELF THERE NEED NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD FIXED
ADIEU AND THE LANDLORD WITHDREW
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVIEW HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED UNDECIDED
A COLD SHIVER PASSED THROUGH POOR DE GUICHE
YOU WILL TELL HIM HOW MUCH YOU REGRET HAVING SPOKEN SO LIGHTLY AND THAT THE NOBILITY AND PURITY OF HIS RACE ARE INSCRIBED NOT IN HIS HEART ALONE BUT STILL MORE IN EVERY ACTION OF HIS LIFE
ARE YOU NOT WITH THE KING OF FRANCE
LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED HOWEVER THAT MADAME POSSESSED SUCH TERRIBLE PASSIONS AS THE HEROINES OF THE MIDDLE AGES OR THAT SHE REGARDED THINGS FROM A PESSIMISTIC POINT OF VIEW
YOU ARE THE STAR OF THE COURT AND WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR APPEARANCE EVERYTHING WILL BE RESPLENDENT OH MADAME MADAME SAID LOUIS XIV YOU KNOW WELL THAT THERE IS NO BRILLIANCY THAT DOES NOT PROCEED FROM YOURSELF AND THAT IF I ASSUME THE SUN AS MY DEVICE IT IS ONLY AN EMBLEM SIRE YOU FLATTER YOUR ALLY AND YOU WISH TO DECEIVE HER SAID MADAME THREATENING THE KING WITH HER FINGER MENACINGLY RAISED
THE KING WISHES PERHAPS TO AMUSE HIMSELF AT MY EXPENSE I WILL AMUSE MYSELF AT HIS AND AS THE KING IS VERY TENDER-HEARTED I WILL TAKE HIS HEART BY STORM LA VALLIERE HID HER FACE IN HER HANDS AS SHE STIFLED HER SOBS
OF THE KING WITHOUT SPEAKING OF HIS BROTHER'S WIFE
AND SO THEY ARE IN THE SULKS WITH ME WE WILL DINE ALONE SAID THE CHEVALIER WITH A SIGH
SAINT-AIGNAN WAS NEVER VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND
IF AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL INSTINCTIVELY ATTRACTED TOWARDS THE SUPERINTENDENT IF I EVEN MAKE AN ADVANCE TO HIM WHICH I CONFESS IS VERY PROBABLE MY MOTIVE FOR IT IS THAT M
AN ERASURE
ANNE LEANED HER HEAD UPON HER HANDS AND THEN LOOKING AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS MURMURED IT HAS BEEN TRULY SAID THAT A WOMAN WHO HAS TRULY LOVED IS ALWAYS YOUNG AND THAT THE BLOOM OF THE GIRL OF TWENTY YEARS EVER LIES CONCEALED IN SOME SECRET CLOISTER OF THE HEART 1 CHAPTER XVIII
HE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT FELLOW AND POSSESSES A VERY KEEN SCENT
WHAT IS THE MATTER HE SAID IN A GENTLE TONE OF VOICE AND WHO IS MAKING THIS DISTURBANCE IT SO HAPPENED THAT AT THE MOMENT HE BEGAN TO SPEAK SILENCE HAD JUST BEEN RESTORED AND ALTHOUGH HIS VOICE WAS VERY SOFT AND GENTLE IN ITS TOUCH EVERY ONE HEARD HIS QUESTION
ENDEAVOR TO BRING THEM BOTH BACK COUNT A BAD HEART BAD MURMURED DE GUICHE
UPBRAID ME AS YOU LIKE SINCE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME OH
ANNE OF AUSTRIA ADOPTED THE SAME MEANS TOWARDS MONSIEUR AND EVEN TOWARDS THE KING HIMSELF
HE HAD BEEN OBSERVING HIS ENEMY DURING THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HAD BEEN APPROACHING HIM GRADUALLY
YOU TOO BOOTED AND SPURRED
GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN SAID DE GUICHE DO NOT SET SUCH AN EXAMPLE IN PUBLIC IN THE STREET TOO
I SHALL HAVE A VISIT TO PAY IN TOWN
SHE TOO IS JEALOUS SAID LA VALLIERE WITH A MARKED TONE OF VOICE
DO YOU NOT THINK RAOUL THAT INTELLIGENT AND VIGOROUS MEN AS WE ARE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED TO RETREAT BEFORE THE BRUTE STRENGTH OF WIND AND WAVES THAT IS PRECISELY THE VERY REFLECTION I WAS SILENTLY MAKING TO MYSELF REPLIED BRAGELONNE
THE CONSTRUCTIVE PLAN OF MALICORNE--FOR WE MAY WELL SUPPOSE THAT THE COMBINATIONS OF A MIND AS ACTIVE AS HIS WERE NOT CONFINED TO THE PRESENT BUT EXTENDED TO THE FUTURE--THE CONSTRUCTIVE PLAN OF MALICORNE WE SAY WAS THIS:--TO OBTAIN ENTRANCE INTO THE HOUSEHOLD OF MADAME HENRIETTA FOR A WOMAN DEVOTED TO HIMSELF WHO WAS INTELLIGENT YOUNG HANDSOME AND INTRIGUING
THAT PERHAPS IS FAIR
HE WILL DO MORE IN ONE DAY THAN I IN A MONTH
THE ENTREE WAS BRILLIANT AND JOYOUS
HER SMILE STIMULATES LUXURY AROUSES WIT AND EVEN COURAGE
BE NOT AFRAID LOVE BUT THE KING OF FRANCE WHO IS ABOVE ALL AND A MOVEMENT OF WHOSE SCEPTERED HAND WILL PROTECT YOU AGAINST ALL ATTACKS EVEN FROM YOUR OWN REMORSE
I BEGGED I IMPLORED HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ANYTHING
BUT CONFESS THAT I KNOW HOW TO REPAIR A WRONG I MAY HAVE DONE I CONFESS THAT WILL YOUR HIGHNESS DO ME THE FAVOR TO WAIT HERE A FEW MINUTES WILLINGLY
BUT AS HE DID SO CASTING A PARTING GLANCE AROUND HIM AND PERCEIVING M
YOU HAVE NO KIND OF FEELING THEN FOR GUICHE HE SAID MORE DISTURBED THAN BECAME HIS CHARACTER OF MEDIATOR
IMMEDIATELY AND AS IF SOME EVIL GENIUS WAS AT HIS ORDERS HE PERCEIVED RETURNING TOWARDS THE CHATEAU ACCOMPANIED BY A MAN A SILK MANTLE OF A DARK COLOR AND RECOGNIZED THE FIGURE WHICH HAD STRUCK HIS ATTENTION HALF AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY
BUT DO NOT LET US TALK OF MONEY MATTERS ANY LONGER ON THE CONTRARY WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF THEM FOR THAT IS MY ONLY REASON FOR COMING TO SEE YOU I AM AT A LOSS TO COMPASS YOUR MEANING SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT WHOSE EYES BEGAN TO EXPRESS AN ANXIOUS CURIOSITY
THE ENGLISH FLEET WAS SOON RECOGNIZED BY THE LINE OF THE SHIPS AND BY THE COLOR OF THEIR PENNANTS
IT IS ASSERTED THAT THE KING IS MADLY IN LOVE WITH THAT LITTLE LA VALLIERE
WELL AND IS THERE ANYTHING NEW WHAT ABOUT ABOUT MY POST IN MONSIEUR'S HOUSEHOLD AH MY DEAR MALICORNE NO ONE HAS VENTURED LATELY TO APPROACH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WELL BUT NOW NOW IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING
FOUQUET AND AS BELLE-ISLE IS IN THE DIOCESE OF VANNES AND AS YOU ARE BISHOP OF VANNES BUT MY DEAR BAISEMEAUX SINCE YOU KNEW I WAS BISHOP OF VANNES YOU HAD NO OCCASION TO ASK M
MONSIEUR BECOMES JEALOUS OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PORTRAIT IS BUT A MERE SKETCH AND MANY MORE ADDITIONS COULD BE MADE BUT I FEAR TO WEARY YOUR PATIENCE OR OFFEND THE MODESTY OF THE SHEPHERDESS AND I SHALL THEREFORE PASS ON TO HER COMPANION AMARYLLIS VERY WELL SAID MADAME PASS ON TO AMARYLLIS MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN WE ARE ALL ATTENTION AMARYLLIS IS THE ELDEST OF THE THREE AND YET SAINT-AIGNAN HASTENED TO ADD THIS ADVANCED AGE DOES NOT REACH TWENTY YEARS MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHO HAD SLIGHTLY KNITTED HER BROWS AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DESCRIPTION UNBENT THEM WITH A SMILE
OF COURSE OF COURSE DO YOU OBJECT THEN TO TRY AND MAKE A CONQUEST OF HER IN ONE RESPECT ONLY
THIS LAST WORD HOWEVER IGNITED THE POWDER
THE KING HAS HIMSELF TOLD ME SO ON WHAT OCCASION UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF M
AT ALL EVENTS WHEN YOU GET CLEAR OF THE LABYRINTH YOU WILL SEE AN AVENUE OF SYCAMORES AND THIS AVENUE LEADS STRAIGHT TO THE PAVILION IN WHICH M
I AM NOT DISPOSED TO PAY PEOPLE ILL COMPLIMENTS EVERY DAY
MAZARIN HAD SAID
WE WILL FIRST VISIT LA BERTAUDIERE SAID BAISEMEAUX STILL INTENDING THE SENTINELS TO HEAR HIM
I WILL BE YOUR GUARANTEE WITH MADAME DE BELLIERE THAT YOUR DEVOTION IS ALTOGETHER POLITIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY DEAR D'HERBLAY AND WHOSE NAME HAVE YOU JUST PRONOUNCED A NAME WHICH OUGHT TO CONVINCE YOU THAT AS I AM SO WELL INFORMED ABOUT YOURSELF I MAY POSSIBLY BE JUST AS WELL INFORMED ABOUT OTHERS
HAVING THEREFORE AS YOU ASSERT SO MANY CAUSES OF COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM SHOW YOUR COURAGE IN SEEKING HIM OUT AND AFFORD HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING YOU THAT SATISFACTION YOU SEEM TO ASK OF EVERY ONE BUT OF HIMSELF DE WARDES PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD WHICH WAS COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION
WE KNOW WITH WHOM WE HAVE TO DO AND YOU WILL BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY THESE WORDS AND THEIR ACCOMPANYING GESTURE MALICORNE HAD THOUGHT VERY FRIENDLY BUT RATHER OBSCURE
YOU WELL KNOW THAT THE COURT HAS NO INDULGENCE FOR THIS SORT OF PECCADILLO
THAT IS NOT UNLIKELY IS SHE WITTY AT ALL EVENTS INQUIRED THE DUKE
NO NO WE WILL GO ON FOOT BAISEMEAUX THEN OFFERED HIS ARM AS A SUPPORT BUT THE PRELATE DID NOT ACCEPT IT
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HOWEVER HE TURNED TO THE YOUNG PRISONER AND SAID
FOUQUET OF ME SIRE YES I HAVE TO PAY YOU A THOUSAND COMPLIMENTS I CANNOT EXPRESS TO YOUR MAJESTY THE DELIGHT WITH WHICH YOU OVERWHELM ME I UNDERSTAND YOU M
DURING THE TIME SHE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE CENTER OF TOWN AND TREADING BENEATH HER DELICATE FEET THE RICHEST CARPETS AND THE GAYEST FLOWERS WHICH HAD BEEN STREWN UPON THE GROUND DE GUICHE AND RAOUL ESCAPING FROM THEIR ENGLISH FRIENDS HURRIED THROUGH THE TOWN AND HASTENED RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE PLACE INTENDED FOR THE RESIDENCE OF MADAME
BUT THAT DOES NOT MATTER
YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN HEAR SAID ATHENAIS
D'ARTAGNAN MYSELF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I TRUST SAID RAOUL
SHE HAS HARDLY ANY FLESH UPON HER BONES NAY
MAZARINADES ETC
YOU TAKE THE MATTER UP VERY SERIOUSLY YES
MY DEAR DUKE SAID HE WITH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE POLITENESS
VERY SLIGHTLY MADAME
THE WEALTHIEST IT MAY BE
I AM A PRINCE UNFORTUNATELY VERY MUCH NEGLECTED GUICHE HAD NOW RECOVERED HIS SELF-POSSESSION AND WITH THE SPIRITED BOLDNESS WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HIM AND SAT SO WELL UPON HIM HE SAID YOUR HIGHNESS KNOWS VERY WELL THAT MY VERY LIFE IS AT YOUR SERVICE AND WHENEVER THERE IS A QUESTION OF ITS BEING NEEDED I AM READY
MADAME'S MARRIAGE WAS CELEBRATED IN THE CHAPEL OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IN THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF COURTIERS WHO HAD BEEN MOST SCRUPULOUSLY SELECTED
THIRTY LEAGUES IN A DAY IS TOO MUCH YOU WOULD KILL YOURSELF I THINK NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN OBLIGING A FRIEND YOU ARE QUITE HEROIC WHERE ARE THE TWENTY PISTOLES HERE THEY ARE SAID MALICORNE SHOWING THEM
I AM TOLD MY LORD YOU HAVE RICH POSSESSIONS IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND THAT YOU LIVE IN A SPLENDID AND TIME-HONORED PLACE IT WAS MY FATHER'S RESIDENCE REPLIED BUCKINGHAM CASTING DOWN HIS EYES
THE LANDLORD SALUTED THE NEW ARRIVAL AS A MAN WHO RECOGNIZES HIS TRUE GUEST
THE LATTER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT EASILY MOVED FELT THE TEARS RUSH TO HER EYES
THE CHEVALIER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AT THE LAST PARAGRAPH AND IN FACT DE WARDES WAS OUT OF DATE AS WE HAVE SEEN
NEVER ANY SINCERITY IN MY INTERCOURSE WITH ANY ONE
IT WAS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR HER TO HAVE INFLICTED SOME SLIGHT WOUND UPON THE VANITY OR SELF-ESTEEM OF ONE WHO SO SOON FORGETTING THE ENGAGEMENTS HE HAD CONTRACTED SEEMED TO HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DISDAIN WITHOUT CAUSE THE NOBLEST AND HIGHEST PRIZE IN FRANCE
YES SIRE IT IS THUS SAID D'ARTAGNAN PHILOSOPHICALLY REPLYING TO THE ROYAL THOUGHT IT IS THUS THE PAST FLIES AWAY THAT IS TRUE MONSIEUR THAT IS TRUE
THAT MAN IS DANGEROUS,--HE WILL KILL YOU MY FATHER REPLIED RAOUL LIVED FOR TWENTY YEARS UNDER THE MENACE OF A MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE ENEMY AND HE STILL LIVES YOUR FATHER HAD GOOD FRIENDS VISCOUNT YES SIGHED RAOUL SUCH FRIENDS INDEED THAT NONE ARE NOW LEFT LIKE THEM DO NOT SAY THAT I BEG AT THE VERY MOMENT I OFFER YOU MY FRIENDSHIP AND BUCKINGHAM OPENED HIS ARMS TO EMBRACE RAOUL WHO DELIGHTEDLY RECEIVED THE PROFFERED ALLIANCE
AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TWO LINES WERE ABOUT TO UNITE THEY WERE BROKEN BY A THIRD
IF THEREFORE IT SHOULD HAPPEN THAT WE HAVE ANY ORDERS REQUIRING TO BE CARRIED OUT PORTHOS IS AN INCARNATION OF THE ORDER ITSELF AND WHATEVER HE CHOSE TO DO OTHERS WOULD FIND THEMSELVES OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO SEND HIM BACK THEN THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO
SAINT-AIGNAN DREW ASIDE OUT OF RESPECT
AND FATIGUE PERHAPS NO SIRE SAID MONTALAIS EAGERLY ANSWERING FOR HER FRIEND IT COULD NOT BE FROM FATIGUE FOR WE PASSED MOST OF THE EVENING SEATED BENEATH THE ROYAL OAK UNDER THE ROYAL OAK RETURNED THE KING STARTING
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND I SHALL ONLY WISH IT WHEN YOU YOURSELF DO OH I AM QUITE EASY ON THAT SCORE SAID BAISEMEAUX SMILING
FOR MALICORNE YES AND NO
THE TRAVELER DRAWING HIS CLOAK ROUND HIM SO AS TO COVER THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE CAST A RAPID GLANCE AT MALICORNE AND SAID THIS GENTLEMAN IS NO FRIEND OF MINE THE LANDLORD STARTED VIOLENTLY
OH EXCLAIMED MADAME FONTAINEBLEAU IS SELECTED ARBITRARILY BY THE POET
LET US RETURN TO OUR CARRIAGE AND AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO THE CHATEAU CHAPTER LXIII
IN THAT CASE DO WHAT I SAID
YES WE ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SO GOOD A MEMORY SAID ARAMIS SMILING IN HIS TURN BUT ARE YOU NOT AFRAID THAT YOUR COACHMAN FINDING WE DO NOT RETURN WILL SUPPOSE WE HAVE TAKEN ANOTHER ROAD BACK AND THAT HE WILL NOT FOLLOW THE CARRIAGES BELONGING TO THE COURT OH THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT SAID FOUQUET
FOUQUET I THINK THAT IF HEAVEN HAS BESTOWED ON THE EAGLE A BEAK AND CLAWS IT IS TO ENABLE HIM TO SHOW HIS ROYAL CHARACTER THE KING BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE
I SHALL NEVER SUCCEED IN CARRYING IT OUT I WILL DO IT SAID ARAMIS
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER MONTALAIS THE WOODS OF CHEVERNY AND OF CHAMBORD THE INNUMERABLE RUSTLING POPLARS OF BLOIS WHERE WE EXCHANGED OUR MUTUAL HOPES AND CONFIDENCES TOO YES WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL
SHE HEARD NOTHING OR RATHER HAD PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AT ALL
AFTER THE RECEPTION OF THE PRINCESS AND AMBASSADORS MONSIEUR SOLICITED THE KING'S PERMISSION TO PRESENT TO HIM AS WELL AS TO MADAME THE PERSONS BELONGING TO THEIR NEW HOUSEHOLD
ALL THESE VARIOUS REASONINGS WERE LIKE SO MANY ACTUAL STINGS TO THE KING'S PRIDE
TOBY HE EXCLAIMED
MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE LA FERE WHOSE NOM DE GUERRE WAS ATHOS WHISPERED D'ARTAGNAN TO BAISEMEAUX
OF ALL THE FEELINGS AND SENTIMENTS I EXPERIENCE LEAVE ME TO ENJOY THE PLEASING INSTINCT OF DISINTERESTEDNESS THE SENTIMENTS YOU EXPRESS SAID THE KING ARE INDEED ADMIRABLE QUITE TRUE MURMURED ARAMIS IN FOUQUET'S EAR AND HE CANNOT BE ACCUSTOMED TO THEM BUT REPLIED FOUQUET SUPPOSE SHE WERE TO MAKE A SIMILAR REPLY TO MY LETTER TRUE SAID ARAMIS LET US NOT ANTICIPATE BUT WAIT THE CONCLUSION AND THEN DEAR MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY ADDED THE SUPERINTENDENT HARDLY ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENTS WHICH LA VALLIERE HAD JUST EXPRESSED IT IS VERY OFTEN SOUND CALCULATION TO SEEM DISINTERESTED WITH MONARCHS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING THIS VERY MINUTE SAID ARAMIS
ON THE SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS WHETHER FROM FATIGUE OR EMOTION THE BREATHING OF THE VISITOR BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL
THERE YOUR FEAR OF MADAME HAS BEGUN AGAIN REPLIED THE PRINCE
FAUCHEUX
FAUCHEUX
FAUCHEUX
I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO BELIEVE IT IF YOUR MAJESTY CONTINUES TO HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE TOWARDS ME I AM MOST UNHAPPY THEN SAID THE KING IN A TONE OF REGRET WHICH WAS NOT ASSUMED
PERMIT ME TO PRESERVE MINE
DE BRAGELONNE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHO HIS MOTHER WAS RAOUL'S EYES FLASHED AS DARTING FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED,--"CHEVALIER THIS IS A PERSONAL AFFAIR OF MY OWN AT WHICH EXCLAMATION A SMILE FULL OF MALICE PASSED ACROSS DE WARDES'S FACE
DO NOT FORGET MADAME THAT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE COMPARED THE KING TO THE SUN
AND NOW SHE RESUMED AFTER HAVING RECOVERED HER BREATH TELL ME THE WHOLE TRUTH AND CONCEAL NOTHING FROM ME OH MADAME CRIED THE YOUNG GIRL YOU ARE ALREADY ANGRY WITH ME NO MY DEAR ATHENAIS REASSURE YOURSELF I AM IN NO WAY ANGRY WITH YOU
DO PRAY RECOVER CONTINUED SAINT-AIGNAN
DE GUICHE ON THE OTHER HAND PALER STILL PERHAPS FROM HAPPINESS THAN HIS RIVAL WAS FROM ANGER SEATED HIMSELF TREMBLINGLY NEXT TO THE PRINCESS WHOSE SILKEN ROBE AS IT LIGHTLY TOUCHED HIM CAUSED A TREMOR OF MINGLED REGRET AND HAPPINESS TO PASS THROUGH HIS WHOLE FRAME
SAINT-AIGNAN BENT TOWARDS MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE TO WHISPER TO HER SINCE WE HAVE EACH A NUMBER LET US UNITE OUR TWO CHANCES
I DO NOT COMPLAIN CONTINUED THE PRINCESS IN A TONE OF VOICE FULL OF GENTLENESS
I SPOKE TO THE FRANCISCAN HIMSELF AND WISHED TO PROVE TO HIM THE IMPROPRIETY OF THE STEP
YOU ARE INDEED A FRIEND RAOUL
HE EXTENDED HIS SHRUNKEN HAND ON WHICH GLITTERED THE RING OF THE GENERAL OF THE ORDER
HE BIT HIS LIPS BUT WHEN HE OPENED THEM AGAIN TO UTTER A FEW COMMONPLACE REMARKS HE SAID ADVANCING TOWARDS THE QUEENS I HAVE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT EVERYTHING IS NOW PREPARED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY DIRECTIONS A MURMUR OF SATISFACTION AROSE FROM THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THE KING PERCEIVED ON EVERY FACE THE GREATEST ANXIETY TO RECEIVE AN INVITATION FOR THE FETES
SO THAT THE KING TOOK LEAVE OF HER WITHOUT HAVING REPOSED THE SLIGHTEST CONFIDENCE IN HER
2 THE FEW DAINTIES I POINTED OUT DEAR M
BUT DEAD YOU WOULD NEVER FORGET ME I AM SURE HENRIETTA WHO WAS STANDING BURIED IN THOUGHT AND NEARLY AS AGITATED AS DE GUICHE HIMSELF TURNED ASIDE HER HEAD AS BUT A MINUTE BEFORE HE HAD TURNED ASIDE HIS
OH SAID THE LATTER RESISTING DO NOT TAKE ME TOWARDS THOSE DARK WOODS IT IS TOO DAMP THERE
IT MUST BE ASCERTAINED WHAT ELSE THESE MEN HAVE DONE WITH THE SECRET TO GET IT BACK AGAIN AND BURY IT IT SHALL BE DONE THREE DANGEROUS AFFILIATED MEMBERS MUST BE SENT AWAY INTO TIBET THERE TO PERISH
BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO SUMMON TO YOUR AID ALL YOUR PRUDENCE AND ALL YOUR JUDGMENT OH EXCLAIMED LOUIS LAUGHING FROM THIS VERY DAY I SHALL BEGIN TO ACT MY PART AND YOU SHALL SEE WHETHER I AM NOT QUITE FIT TO REPRESENT THE CHARACTER OF A TENDER SWAIN
DO YOU COME TOO RAOUL
YOU ADMIT THAT SUCH A PASSION DOES NOT GIVE WAY READILY
HER PURSE WAS WELL FILLED AND SHE HAD AT HER DISPOSAL A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN AMASSED BY MAZARIN FOR HER AND LODGED IN A PLACE OF SAFETY
BUT I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECALLING TO YOU THAT I UNDERTOOK TO APPROACH YOU AS AN AMBASSADOR AN AMBASSADOR COMTE FREQUENTLY ASKS BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS OBTAIN WHAT HE ASKS BUT SIRE IT WILL BE SUCH A BLOW FOR DE BRAGELONNE MY HAND SHALL DEAL THE BLOW
IS NOT THAT YOUR OPINION OH
DE BRAGELONNE MURMURED THE DUKE IN A VOICE HALF-CHOKED AND PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS NECK,--"DO YOU NOT SEE I AM CHOKING IF YOUR DEATH WERE TO TAKE PLACE AT THIS MOMENT MY LORD REPLIED RAOUL WITH UNRUFFLED COMPOSURE I SHOULD INDEED REGARD IT AS A GREAT HAPPINESS FOR THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD PREVENT ALL KINDS OF EVIL REMARKS
I KNOW YOU HAVE RETURNED
IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY I SHOULD RETURN TO ENGLAND NEVER NEVER WILL I PERMIT YOU TO LEAVE FRANCE EXCLAIMED THE KING
PERMIT ME THEN TO RENEW THE ASSURANCE OF MY UTMOST ESTEEM AND RESPECT SAID FOUQUET
DO YOU CONSIDER IT COMPLETELY SETTLED DE WARDES BOWED AND MUTTERED TO HIMSELF INARTICULATELY
THE ADVISERS
MY FATHER WILL CONSENT I KNOW
ASCERTAIN AND IMMEDIATELY TOO OF M
THE NOISE THEY MADE IN ENTERING THE ROOM THE CURRENT OF AIR WHICH THE OPENING OF THE DOOR OCCASIONED RESTORED THE FRANCISCAN TO HIS SENSES
I LEAVE YOU D'ARTAGNAN SAID ATHOS
BUT THEY PITIED AND BEWAILED GREATLY THE FATE OF DE GUICHE AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THEIR COMPASSION AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED WAS NOT MISPLACED
DURING THE DAY PROGRAMMES ESSAYS ENROLMENTS PAYMENTS
I HAVE REPENTED OF IT AND MORE THAN THAT--I STILL REPENT IT M
WELL THEN MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IS MADAME'S CHAPERON
LOOK AT MY GREY HAIR AND MY FOREHEAD FULL OF ANXIOUS THOUGHT HE CONTINUED
BE KIND ENOUGH TO GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM THE PERSON HE EXPECTED HAS ARRIVED THE CONFESSOR ASTOUNDED LOOKED AT HIS PENITENT
THEN KNITTING HIS BROWS LIKE THE GREATEST OF ALL THE HEATHEN DEITIES:--"I AM WAITING TO LEARN THE REPLY YOU MADE HE DEMANDED IN AN IMPERIOUS MANNER
THE PLUME IN HIS HAT WAS RED
I CAN CERTIFY HE IS ALMOST A POET HIMSELF SAINT-AIGNAN THUS BROUGHT PROMINENTLY FORWARD WAS COMPELLED TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF AS ADVANTAGEOUSLY AS POSSIBLE
BUT WHY I ASK ARE YOU BOOTED IN THIS MANNER REPEATED MONTALAIS WHILST LA VALLIERE ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AT RAOUL WITH A SURPRISE EQUAL TO THAT OF HER COMPANION NEVERTHELESS UTTERED NOT A WORD
SUDDENLY AT THE OTHER SIDE OF A DITCH UNDER THE BRANCHES OF A WILLOW THEY PERCEIVED A WOMAN ON HER KNEES HOLDING ANOTHER IN HER ARMS WHO SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED
IF THIS GENTLEMAN WILL TAKE THE ROOM I WILL TAKE THE APARTMENT
YOU DRAW BACK THEN SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO HE SAID
WHAT HARM I ASK YOU CAN THERE BE IN A MAN GIVING TO HIS COUNTRYWOMAN A RECIPE FOR A NEW ESSENCE
MY HEART IS FULL OF SCRUPLES AND SILLY FEELINGS OF PRIDE WITH RESPECT TO EVERYTHING THAT A WOMAN OUGHT TO KEEP SECRET AND IN THIS RESPECT NO ONE HAS EVER READ INTO THE BOTTOM OF MY SOUL THAT I KNOW VERY WELL
ARE YOU STILL ON DRY LAND MY LORD YES AT PRESENT I AM
MARGUERITE EMBRACED HER PRESSED HER HANDS AND HARDLY ALLOWED HER TIME TO SPEAK
THEN HE MADE ME SWEAR UPON THE ASHES OF OUR MASTERS TO SERVE ROYALTY REPRESENTED BY YOU--INCARNATE IN YOU SIRE--TO SERVE IT IN WORD IN THOUGHT AND IN ACTION
A TRUE STORY YES CONFESS WHETHER INVENTION OR TRUE STORY THAT IT WAS TOLD TO YOU AS YOU HAVE TOLD IT TO ME BUT THAT YOU WERE NOT THERE UPON MY HONOR MADAME I WAS THERE AND YOU THINK THAT THESE CONFESSIONS MAY HAVE MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE KING CERTAINLY AS THOSE OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE DID UPON ME REPLIED SAINT-AIGNAN
FROM TIME TO TIME HE NOTICED MADAME AND THE KING SETTING FORTH ON HUNTING EXPEDITIONS OR PREPARING FOR THE RECEPTION OF DIFFERENT FANTASTIC PERSONAGES SOLEMN CEREMONIALS WHICH HAD BEEN EXTEMPORIZED A FORTNIGHT BEFORE AND IN WHICH MADAME'S SPARKLING WIT AND THE KING'S MAGNIFICENCE WERE EQUALLY WELL DISPLAYED
ADIEU HE SAID TO HIM SLEEP UNDISTURBED AND SEND YOUR LETTER TO LA VALLIERE
MONSIEUR WAS IN ONE OF THOSE FITS OF GOOD HUMOR TO WHICH THE ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN GOOD LOOKS SOMETIMES GAVE OCCASION
NEITHER THE LUGUBRIOUS SOUNDS OF THE BELLS NOR THE VOICES OF THE CHANTERS NOR THE SPLENDOR OF THE WAX-LIGHTS THROUGH THE WINDOWS NOR THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE FUNERAL HAD POWER TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF TWO PERSONS PLACED AT A WINDOW OF THE INTERIOR COURT--A WINDOW THAT WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH AND WHICH LIGHTED A CHAMBER FORMING PART OF WHAT WERE CALLED THE LITTLE APARTMENTS
A GOOD IDEA NO DOUBT MADAME REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
AND NOW PRAY FORGIVE ME MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS
BUT I WILL NOT ENDURE IT ANY LONGER I MUST LEARN WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON OH MONSEIGNEUR AN EXPOSURE BY HEAVEN MONSIEUR SHALL I PUT MYSELF OUT OF THE WAY WHEN PEOPLE SHOW SO LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR ME
COME COME SHE SAID THIS IS DOUBTING AND HESITATION TOO MUCH--TO THE PROOF SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE TIMEPIECE
D'ARTAGNAN WHAT CAUSE HAS HE GIVEN YOU ME
CONCEALED BY THE TAPESTRY WHICH COVERED THE DOORWAY AND LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL HE COULD THUS LISTEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN
A GOOD DEAL OF THE PRIEST AND SOMETHING OF THE SOLDIER
SHE IS ALWAYS KIND AND CHARMING ALWAYS MONSIEUR SURELY SHE COULD HAVE GIVEN ME SOME PRECISE INFORMATION ABOUT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
THE CELLS ARE VERY GOOD PLACES TO LIVE IN I REALLY DO NOT AND CANNOT BELIEVE IT AND THAT IS A FACT PRAY DO NOT SPEAK ILL OF SECOND BERTAUDIERE
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF ORLEANS WAS ALWAYS EXCEEDINGLY KIND TOWARDS M
MONSIEUR MALICORNE WHAT JOY CRIED LOUISE CLAPPING HER HANDS AND BOUNDING WITH PLEASURE
BY HER CLEAR AND LUSTROUS GLANCE BY HER LOFTY CARRIAGE BY HER HAUGHTY ATTITUDE AND MORE THAN ALL THAT BY THE THROBBING OF HIS OWN HEART DE GUICHE RECOGNIZED MADAME AND UTTERING A LOUD CRY HE REMOVED HIS HANDS FROM HIS TEMPLE AND COVERED HIS EYES WITH THEM
UNDERSTAND MY WORDS AS YOU LIKE I TAKE THEM IN THE MANNER THEY CANNOT BUT BE UNDERSTOOD REPLIED BUCKINGHAM WITH THAT HAUGHTY TONE WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM AND WHICH EVEN IN ORDINARY CONVERSATION GAVE A TONE OF DEFIANCE TO EVERYTHING HE SAID
I RECOGNIZE THESE EMERALDS SAID M
SOON HOWEVER THE ENTIRE TOWN WAS WRAPPED IN SLUMBER
WHEN THIS MONK DYING THOUGH HE SEEMED TO BE RAISED HIMSELF UPON HIS ARM FIXED A PAIR OF BLAZING EYES UPON ME AND IN A VOICE WHICH WAS ADMIRABLY SUITED FOR COMMANDING A CHARGE OF CAVALRY SAID TURN THIS FELLOW OUT OF DOORS WHICH WAS DONE IMMEDIATELY BY THE LANDLORD AND THE FOUR PORTERS WHO MADE ME DESCEND THE STAIRCASE SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN WAS AGREEABLE
THE PHYSICIAN HESITATED
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN RUNNING MY HEAD INTO THE LION'S DEN IN ENTERING THE CHATEAU AS MY IMPRUDENT FRIEND HAS DONE
A GREAT BLANK THEREUPON ENSUED IN THE SCENE AND PERFECT SILENCE IN THE BOAT
INVITE ME AND I WILL GO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL DEIGN TO ACCEPT MURMURED THE SUPERINTENDENT
NOW I FOR INSTANCE CAN'T READ OR WRITE AND THEREFORE I AM NOT IN PRISON ARAMIS LOOKED AT THE MAN WHO SEEMED TO THINK THAT BEING A JAILER IN THE BASTILE WAS NOT BEING IN PRISON
MONTALAIS HAD ALREADY DARTED AWAY LIKE A DEER AND NEITHER CROSS-ROAD NOR LABYRINTH WAS ABLE TO LEAD HER WRONG
THAT IS NOT ANSWERING ME DE GUICHE YES YES WELL WHAT REPLY HAVE YOU TO MAKE THIS THAT WHEN THE DAY ARRIVES I SHALL BE NO MORE A LIVING BEING THAN I FEEL MYSELF NOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SO MANY VICISSITUDES HAVE WORN ME OUT
QUIET HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RESTORED EXCEPT IN BUCKINGHAM'S HEART
COLBERT SEEMED GIFTED WITH UBIQUITY
FOUQUET I HAVE CERTAIN FUNDS WHICH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASS ME
OR RATHER TELL ME HOW YOUR AFFAIRS HERE ARE GETTING ON NOT OVER WELL THE DEUCE M
DO YOU WISH TO COME TO PARIS TO REMAIN HERE ALONE IN THIS OLD CASTLE I WHO HAVE ENJOYED THE DELIGHTFUL HABIT OF LISTENING TO YOUR SONGS OF PRESSING YOUR HAND OF RUNNING ABOUT THE PARK WITH YOU
AS FOR MANICAMP HE WENT TO THE ASSISTANCE OF DE GUICHE WHO NATURALLY REMAINED NEAR MADAME AND BOTH OF THEM WITH THE PRINCESS HERSELF COURAGEOUSLY SUSTAINED THE ATTACK
OR IS IT LIKELY THAT IT MIGHT BE NO NO
HE SHALL HAVE SOME BISCUITS AND PRESERVES WITH THIS SMALL BOTTLE OF PORT YOU ARE A GOOD-HEARTED FELLOW
WITH ONE HAND ARAMIS SIGNED TO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE CONFESSOR TO WITHDRAW AND WITH THE OTHER HE HANDED TO THE FRANCISCAN A PAPER ENCLOSED IN A DOUBLE ENVELOPE
IF I WERE AWARE OF THE CAUSE OF YOUR HAPPINESS HE SAID I SHOULD PROBABLY FEAR FOR YOUR GRACE
BUT I RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR RESPECT DE GUICHE
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO MANAGE IT
WELL MONSEIGNEUR WHAT DO YOUR EYES SAY
BUT AT THE END OF THE WEEK THEY CRIED OUT SAYING THAT FORMER OFFICERS AMUSED THEMSELVES MUCH BETTER
YES MONSIEUR MALICORNE IT WOULD BE FOR ME AND IF MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS ASKS IT AT THE SAME TIME MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS DOES NOT ASK IT SHE REQUIRES IT WELL
DE BRAGELONNE HE SAID IS IT INDEED A GENTLEMAN WHO IS SPEAKING TO ME YES
BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE A PIECE OF ADVICE WHAT IS IT RESUME YOUR GOOD-HUMOR,--YOU ARE UGLY WHEN YOU POUT COARSE COME LET US TELL THE TRUTH TO EACH OTHER WHILE WE ARE ABOUT IT OH MALICORNE
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS OF A HALF NOBLE FAMILY NOT ONLY WOULD BE DOWERED BUT WOULD ENNOBLE MALICORNE
THEY RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO AN ORDER OF EXILE
THEY WAITED A FURTHER TEN MINUTES
YOU SEE MADAME SAID THE KING AS HE APPROACHED HER THAT I TOO AM HUNTING ON YOUR BEHALF AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM SAID GENTLEMEN SEE IF EACH OF YOU CANNOT OBTAIN AS MUCH FOR THESE LADIES A REMARK WHICH WAS A SIGNAL FOR ALL TO RETIRE
FOR WHICH I THANK YOU
IF YOU ONLY KNEW AT WHAT A COST I PROCURED THE LAST SUPPLY THE NEXT SHALL COST YOU NOTHING BUT WHO WILL GIVE IT ME I WILL WHAT GIVE ME SIX MILLIONS TEN IF NECESSARY UPON MY WORD D'HERBLAY SAID FOUQUET YOUR CONFIDENCE ALARMS ME MORE THAN THE KING'S DISPLEASURE
WHAT MOTIVE DO YOU WISH ME TO ASSIGN BE PERFECTLY EASY ON THAT SCORE HE WILL NOT ASK ANY
AND YET HAD YOU NOT SAID ONE WORD YOUR RETURN ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE INDISCRETION
CONFESS THAT GUICHE LOVES YOU AH
IT IS TRUE THE KING'S FIT OF RESENTMENT WAS OVER BUT HIS MIND WAS ABSORBINGLY OCCUPIED BY A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT RAISED HIM ABOVE THE STORMY DISPUTES AND GIDDY PLEASURES OF THE COURT
AND THE GRIMACE HE MADE PLAINLY SAID TO MONTALAIS WHO WAS ALSO FORGOTTEN CANNOT WE CONTRIVE TO ARRANGE MATTERS WITH FORTUNE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT SHE SHALL NOT FORGET US TO WHICH A SMILE FULL OF INTELLIGENCE FROM MADEMOISELLE AURE REPLIED
IT SEEMED AS IF BUCKINGHAM'S DEPARTURE HAD SHED A BALM ON THE LACERATED HEARTS OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING
BUT EVERY ONE WILL BE THERE I TRUST MONSIEUR LE COMTE THAT HE WILL NOT NEGLECT SO EXCELLENT AN OPPORTUNITY HE SHOULD BE AT PARIS BY THIS TIME HE WILL TAKE THE DIRECT ROAD PERHAPS TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME WHERE IS HE NOW AT ORLEANS MONSIEUR SAID DE GUICHE YOU SEEM TO ME A MAN OF VERY GOOD TASTE MALICORNE WAS WEARING SOME OF MANICAMP'S OLD-NEW CLOTHES
I WILL COMPOSE A HOMILY AND READ IT TO HER THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST OH I WILL USE THE UTMOST DILIGENCE
MADAME WAS RIGHT QUITE RIGHT THIS BRUTAL EXILE HAS COMPLETELY TURNED MY BRAIN AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE KING RECEIVED YOU WITH KINDNESS DO YOU THINK SO
SHE IS ALREADY MAID OF HONOR TO THE DOWAGER PRINCESS WHY SHE IS LAME SAID THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE STRETCHING HIMSELF ON HIS CUSHIONS
BUT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE DID NOT SPEAK OF IT IT SEEMED TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER AS WOULD FRIGHTEN SUITORS AWAY AT ALL EVENTS SAID THE KING I KNOW NOTHING OR ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
THESE TWO TENTS WERE DESTINED FOR DE GUICHE AND RAOUL
MADAME I AM NOT AN INVENTOR
IN OTHER WORDS THEY PITILESSLY PICKED TO PIECES EVERY PERSON PRESENT WHO WORE A PETTICOAT
IN SHORT HOWEVER YOU ARE REPORTED TO BE INCORRUPTIBLE AND UNAPPROACHABLE
IN VAIN DID HE BY EXCITING HIS HORSE ALMOST TO MADNESS SPUR HIM AT THE RISK OF DASHING HIMSELF IN PIECES AGAINST THE TREES OR OF ROLLING IN THE DITCHES OVER THE GATES AND BARRIERS WHICH THEY PASSED OR DOWN THE STEEP DECLIVITIES OF THE HILLS
DE BRAGELONNE FOR HAVING ALLOWED MYSELF TO YIELD TO A FIRST IMPULSE DE WARDES HOWEVER ON THE CONTRARY PERFECTLY FURIOUS BOUNDED FORWARD AND RAISED HIS SWORD THREATENINGLY AGAINST RAOUL WHO HAD SCARCELY ENOUGH TIME TO PUT HIMSELF IN A POSTURE OF DEFENSE
YOUR PENITENT IS IN HEAVEN
REALLY ONE WOULD IMAGINE YOU HAD NEVER SEEN THE YOUNG LADY BEFORE IT IS TRUE MY LORD I HAVE SEEN HER BUT IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO
IMMEDIATELY ON OUR ARRIVAL AT PARIS I WILL CONDUCT YOU TO M
THE ORDERLY CLERK
FOUQUET AS A MAN OF GREAT CONSIDERATION THE CHEVALIER DID WHAT THE KING HIMSELF WOULD HAVE DONE NAMELY HE BOWED TO M
THEN GOOD-BYE UNTIL THIS EVENING AND THE TWO PRINCESSES SEPARATED
MY ADMINISTRATION IS SOMEWHAT OVERTAXED AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY I HAVE NOT SLEPT DURING THE PAST NIGHT SO YOU HAVE THE AMOUNT INQUIRED THE MARQUISE WITH SOME ANXIETY
WELL YES
SUMMONED TO MEET EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME UPON THE GROUNDS OF INTEREST AND COMMON CURIOSITY THESE TWO OPPOSITE NATURES WERE MUTUALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MINGLING OF THEIR RECIPROCAL CONTRADICTIONS OF CHARACTER
HE FELT THE TERRIBLE DANGER THAT MENACED HIM FOR THE SEA ROSE FAST
APPARENTLY HOWEVER THERE WERE THREE HOUSES IN THE STREET
THE BLOW HAD BEEN THE MORE PAINFUL ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING UNEXPECTED
I ADVISE HIM TO TAKE DAILY AIRINGS IN THE SMALL PARK WHICH YOU HAVE KEPT FOR YOUR OWN USE AND HE MAKES US OF IT ACCORDINGLY
HE FELT UPON HIS LIPS THE WORD WHICH HAD SO MANY TIMES BEEN REPEATED TO THE DUC DE GUISE
RAOUL SHE ANSWERED SOFTLY
HIS EYES ROLLED IN THEIR SOCKETS A COLD SWEAT POURED DOWN HIS FACE AND HE NEARLY FAINTED AND LAY WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACKWARDS AND HIS ARMS HANGING DOWN ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS CHAIR
WE HAVE THREE HOLY FATHER WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES LUINIGUET FIRST THE NEXT ONE A BROTHER OF THE CARMELITE ORDER NAMED BROTHER HUBERT THE NEXT A SECULAR MEMBER NAMED GRISART AH
GUICHE WHAT A PROTECTOR YOU HAVE BECOME OF YOUNG LADIES SAID THE PRINCE YOU NEVER SPEAK OF ANY ONE ELSE NOW THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE SMILED FOR HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT NOTHING DISPLEASED THE PRINCE MORE THAN TO SHOW ANY INTEREST IN LADIES
BUT IF SHE WERE THE CAUSE OF YOUR BEING EXILED I BEAR YOU NO ILL-WILL IN THAT CASE MONSEIGNEUR SAID DE GUICHE
MALICORNE MALICORNE SIGHED
YOUR SCOLDING OF THIS MORNING TERRIFIED HIM
WELL MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE HERE WE ARE YOU SEE I DO INDEED SEE YOU SAID RAOUL SMILING AND IT IS EXACTLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE THAT I WISH TO ASK FOR SOME EXPLANATION MALICORNE APPROACHED THE GROUP WITH HIS MOST FASCINATING SMILE
DURING TEN YEARS SIRE I HAVE NOT SO OFTEN AS I DESIRED HAD OCCASION TO KEEP IT
THE INN OF THE BEAU PAON HAD ITS PRINCIPAL FRONT TOWARDS THE MAIN STREET
NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY EXPRESS THE MISERY THE POOR GIRL WAS SUFFERING
FOUQUET ONCE MORE RANG IMPATIENTLY
HIS EYES BECAME SUFFUSED WITH BLOOD AND THE HAND WHICH HE DID NOT NEED FOR HIS SUPPORT WANDERED TOWARDS THE HILT OF HIS SWORD
DURING THIS TIME AT THE OTHER END OF THE THEATER NEAR THE LAKE A YOUNG WOMAN WAS SEATED WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE THEATER FROM WHICH WERE ISSUING STREAMS OF LIGHT--THE WINDOW IN QUESTION BEING THAT OF THE ROYAL BOX
PERHAPS YOU WILL DEFEND HIM TOO ANNE OF AUSTRIA BLUSHED AND SMILED AT THE SAME TIME
CRUELLY BODILY I SUPPOSE YES
A MAN I AM INDEED AND A MAN I WILL REMAIN UNLESS BY SUPERIOR ORDERS WELL THEN TELL ME WHAT DO YOU WISH,--WHAT DO YOU REQUIRE,--WHAT DO YOU INSIST UPON SAID MONTALAIS IN A SUBMISSIVE TONE
I AH
DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF
MALICORNE SLIPPED THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN DOOR AND LOOKING AT THE COMTE DE GUICHE WHO WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A FACE HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE INSTEAD OF THE ONE HE EXPECTED SAID
CAN YOU NOT FIND SOMETHING TO SAY
I YIELD I YIELD EVEN WERE IT ONLY TO CONSECRATE SO MUCH DEVOTION
EVENTUALLY THESE SERIALIZED ADVENTURES WERE PUBLISHED IN NOVEL FORM AND BECAME THE THREE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES KNOWN TODAY
MY RESIDENCE IN FRANCE WAS LIMITED
SO I HAVE SAID BAISEMEAUX
THE COUNT WAS SINCERELY PITIED AND ACCORDINGLY GAINED THE VICTORY OVER ALL OTHERS
THE PRINCESS IS PRETTY SAID HE VERY NEGLIGENTLY AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING OF A STRANGER
AND AS THEY WERE CARRYING HIM UP THE STAIRCASE I FOLLOWED AND AS I REACHED THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE I OBSERVED THAT THEY TOOK HIM INTO MY ROOM INTO YOUR ROOM YES INTO MY OWN APARTMENT
THE FACT IS THEN YOU HAVE NO MORE MONEY I HAVE NO MORE SIRE BUT M
HOWEVER NOTWITHSTANDING THE MARKED FAVOR WHICH AN INVITATION INDICATED RAOUL FAITHFUL TO HIS PROMISE TO MALICORNE WHO WAS SO ANXIOUS TO WITNESS THE CEREMONY OBTAINED ADMISSION FOR HIM
BUT EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE WHAT IS BUCKINGHAM'S MOTIVE FOR PROVIDING SUCH A SUPPLY OF LODGINGS YES YES SAID DE WARDES
THE HOTEL WAS SURROUNDED BY TENTS AS BY A GIRDLE OF VARIEGATED COLORS
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND SOME LETTERS WHICH INDICATED A RENDEZVOUS SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF UNDER DISGUISE FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS EXPECTED AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE DARKNESS THAT IS PERFECTLY TRUE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
WHEN THEREFORE HE HEARD THE PASSIONATE CONFESSION HIS STRENGTH SEEMED TO FAIL HIM AND HE HID HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
YET I REMEMBER HOW SHE USED TO COVER ME WITH HER CARESSES AND HER TEARS WHENEVER I WEPT VILLIERS MURMURED THE QUEEN PASSING HER ARM ROUND THE YOUNG MAN'S NECK LOOK UPON ME AS YOUR MOTHER AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHALL EVER MAKE MY SON WEEP I THANK YOU MADAME SAID THE YOUNG MAN AFFECTED AND ALMOST SUFFOCATED BY HIS EMOTION
DE WARDES LET ME PRESENT YOU THE YOUNG MEN SALUTED EACH OTHER IN A RESTRAINED MANNER
IN THAT CASE HE SAID I MAY HOPE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING WHAT HAS HAPPENED OUR GOOD UNDERSTANDING WILL REMAIN UNDISTURBED AND THAT YOU WILL KINDLY CONFER THE FAVOR UPON ME OF BELIEVING IN MY RESPECTFUL FRIENDSHIP LA VALLIERE FANCIED THAT SHE NOW BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND AND SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED M
HIS FEAR CEASES IT IS TRUE
I HAVE ACCUSED YOU IT IS TRUE
SELDON
BUT WHEN HE HAD CAREFULLY IN HIS OWN MIND GONE OVER ALL THE VARIOUS CAUSES OF COMPLAINT LOUIS WAS SURPRISED UPON DUE REFLECTION--IN OTHER WORDS AFTER THE WOUND HAS BEEN DRESSED--TO FIND THAT THERE WERE OTHER CAUSES OF SUFFERING SECRET UNENDURABLE AND UNREVEALED
TWO HOURS AFTER THE SUPERINTENDENT'S CARRIAGE HAD SET OFF BY ARAMIS'S DIRECTIONS CONVEYING THEM BOTH TOWARDS FONTAINEBLEAU WITH THE FLEETNESS OF THE CLOUDS THE LAST BREATH OF THE TEMPEST WAS HURRYING ACROSS THE FACE OF HEAVEN LA VALLIERE WAS CLOSETED IN HER OWN APARTMENT WITH A SIMPLE MUSLIN WRAPPER ROUND HER HAVING JUST FINISHED A SLIGHT REPAST WHICH WAS PLACED UPON A MARBLE TABLE
TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS SHE HEARD THE SPRING OF THE DOOR SOUND
THEY HAD NOT OBSERVED EITHER DE GUICHE OR MADAME THE KING OR LA VALLIERE
PEACE RESTORED TO HER FAMILY A NATION DELIGHTED WITH THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG MONARCH WHO HAD SHOWN AN APTITUDE FOR AFFAIRS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE
AS HE WITHDREW HE DESIRED THE CHEVALIER TO PRESENT HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MADAME AND SAY THAT AS THE NIGHT WAS COOL MONSIEUR WHO WAS AFRAID OF THE TOOTHACHE WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT AGAIN INTO THE PARK DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING
FOR IF IN RETRACING THE FORTY LEAGUES WHICH SEPARATE US FROM BLOIS HE NEEDED TO DRAW BREATH EVEN HE WOULD DIE WITHOUT A MURMUR
IN FOUR DAYS I CAN OVERTHROW THE EMPEROR WHO IS AS YOU ARE AWARE OPPOSED TO THE PROGRESS OF OUR ORDER AND CAN REPLACE HIM BY WHICHEVER OF THE PRINCES OF HIS FAMILY THE ORDER MAY DETERMINE UPON THE FRANCISCAN LISTENED UNMOVED
DE WARDES TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT TURNED PALE BUT DID NOT MOVE
PHILIP MY SON EXCLAIMED ANNE OF AUSTRIA SUCH AN EXPRESSION IS UNWORTHY OF YOU
BE SATISFIED M
I WILL RESERVE THAT POINT FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION THESE WORDS COMPRISED AN ORDER AS WELL AS A CONSOLATION
HE PLEASED HIS MOTHER BY THOSE TRIFLING SYMPATHIZING ATTENTIONS ALL WOMEN ARE GLAD TO RECEIVE
BUT YOU WERE NOT THE FIRST WHO TOLD ME
TELL ME MONSIEUR THIS IS IT SIRE.--WHEN I WAS SETTING OUT ON MY FIRST CAMPAIGN THAT IS TO SAY TO JOIN THE ARMY OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE M
I SHOULD HAVE RETIRED TO MY CHATEAU AT VILLERS-COTTERETS SITUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST IN WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE LED A MOST SENTIMENTAL LIFE IN THE VERY SAME SPOT WHERE MY GRANDFATHER HENRY IV SOJOURNED WITH LA BELLE GABRIELLE
STILL I DO NOT DECEIVE MYSELF
THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD HARDLY RUN TWENTY PACES WHEN THE SOUND WHICH HAD SO MUCH ALARMED THEM WAS RENEWED AMONG THE BRANCHES
DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MARQUISE HAVING ARRIVED BEHIND THE RAMPART AS IT WERE OF HER DOOR FELT THAT HER STRENGTH WAS FAILING HER
CHAPTER XXI
YOUR HIGHNESS ALARMS ME SHE HAS QUITE FORSWORN YOU NOW SAID THE PRINCE WITH A BURST OF LOUD LAUGHTER
YOUR HIGHNESS WISHES ME TO MAGNIFY RUMORS UNTIL IT ATTAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN EVENT HOWEVER SAID THE DUKE IN GREAT DISPLEASURE THE FACT REMAINS THAT YOU WITHDREW ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REPORT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH OTHERS HAVE TALKED TO ME OF THE ATTENTIONS OF M
DE GUICHE IS AN EXCELLENT FELLOW AND FULL OF COURAGE
AND WHAT DOES THAT PROVE EXCEPT THAT I OCCUPY MYSELF ABOUT YOU MORE THAN YOU DESERVE HUM GO BACK THEN TO THE BEAU PAON THAT IS NOW QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION HAVE YOU NOT A ROOM THERE I HAD BUT HAVE IT NO LONGER WHO HAS TAKEN IT FROM YOU THEN I WILL TELL YOU
THE MOST RESERVED OF THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT SEEMED READY TO DEVOUR EVERY SYLLABLE THE COMTE WAS ABOUT TO PRONOUNCE
YOU ARE WOUNDED MY LORD SAID DE WARDES DRAWING BACK A STEP OR TWO
I AM WELL ENOUGH ACQUAINTED WITH WOMEN WHO ARE COQUETTES SAID ARAMIS
DE MAZARIN WAS NOT HARD ENOUGH YES I SEE
I CONFESS HOWEVER TO HAVE HAD CERTAIN PREJUDICES AGAINST YOU IN THAT CASE I WAS INDEED UNHAPPY SIRE BUT THEY EXIST NO LONGER
BUT HIS ARM WAS SEIZED BY A COUPLE OF OFFICERS
THE SUN NEVER SHOWS ITSELF IN THE NIGHT-TIME UPON MY WORD SIRE YOUR MAJESTY SEEMS TO HAVE VERY LITTLE CURIOSITY
I WILL NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU THAT I SHALL MAKE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS BY THE TRANSACTION SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR YOU
IF I HAVE ACTED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER TO WHAT OTHERS DO WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE IT IS BECAUSE I DO NOT LOVE
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
DE GUICHE IS CERTAINLY VERY AMIABLE
AND EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT IT LOUD ENOUGH FOR ALL TO KNOW IT
COME PHILIP SHOW A LITTLE FIRMNESS SAID THE QUEEN-MOTHER
IF I HAD READ IT I SHOULD NOT INTERROGATE YOU AS I HAVE DONE
HOW THEN COULD HIS FATHER'S HEART REMAIN VOID AND CLOSED TO ITS INFLUENCE
IN FACT THE PRINCE OF CONDE WAS ATTENTIVELY SCRUTINIZING THESE TWO IMAGES OF DESOLATION STANDING LIKE CARYATIDES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE NAVE OF THE CHURCH
FOR THERE ARE THE LADIES I SEE WHO ARE GOING TO START WITH THIS REMARK THE KING WITH ALL THE EAGERNESS NOT ONLY OF A YOUNG MAN BUT OF A YOUNG MAN IN LOVE WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO TAKE HIS GLOVES AND CANE WHICH HIS VALET HELD READY FOR HIM
ALL HE CAN DO IS TO HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE YOU AND ENTREAT FORGIVENESS YOUR FORGIVENESS IS GRANTED THEN SAID THE MARQUISE
WHO IS SHE IT IS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SIRE MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE YES SIRE SHE HAS JUST FAINTED POOR CHILD SAID THE KING
IT QUITE ESCAPED MY RECOLLECTION AND YET IT MADE A VERY MARKED IMPRESSION UPON YOU SAID THE CHEVALIER
I HAVE SUMMONED ALL YOUR ADVICE AND MY OWN STRENGTH TO MY AID
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS MADAME THAT MAKES A MILLION SAID THE MARQUISE TO HERSELF
HERE IS A GUIDE TO THE SERIES WHICH MAY PROVE HELPFUL
IT HAPPENED ONE EVENING DURING A HALT AT MANTES THAT WHILE DE GUICHE AND DE WARDES WERE LEANING AGAINST A BARRIER ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION BUCKINGHAM AND RAOUL WERE ALSO TALKING TOGETHER AS THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN
JEALOUS OF WHAT IF YOU PLEASE--OR JEALOUS OF WHOM THE CHEVALIER PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD ALLOWED AN EXCESSIVELY MISCHIEVOUS REMARK TO ESCAPE HIM AS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
BUT I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU TWO RECEIPTS WHICH I NOW DESTROY SAID ARAMIS
THE CONFUSED AND HURRIED CHARACTER OF THE NOTE GAVE THE KING A GREAT DEAL TO REFLECT UPON
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT NOT ONLY SHALL NO ONE EITHER LAUGH OR BOAST IN ANY WAY BUT NO ONE EVEN SHALL FAIL IN THE RESPECT DUE TO YOUR RANK
FOR HE CANCELED THE ZERO AND HAS ADDED A ONE BEFORE THE FIVE
AFTER A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER SOME DROPS OF RAIN PENETRATED THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE AND FELL ON THE KING'S FOREHEAD WHO DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM
THE KING HAS THIS EVENING BEEN STRUCK WITH A STRANGE FANCY
WAS IT MADEMOISELLE AURE DE MONTALAIS WHO MADE YOU UTTER SUCH A GREAT HEAVENS NO MONSEIGNEUR NO REPLIED RAOUL PALE AND TREMBLING
WHO CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE AFTER ALL YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH I SHOULD THINK OF COURSE
AM I NOT MISTRESS OF MY HEART AND SOUL WITHOUT DOUBT A PRETTY PROPERTY
BESIDES YOUR MAJESTY AS TWO VALUABLE SERVANTS IN M
THE TIME MONSIEUR SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE HAUGHTIEST DISDAIN SIMPLY TO COUNT THE MONEY
YES IT IS HE SAID DE GUICHE AS HE HASTENED FORWARD TO MEET HIM
FOUQUET AS WELL AS THE OTHERS
IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT YOU REFUSE ME PRECISELY WHAT IS IT I HAVE THE GREATEST DESIRE TO SEE THE CEREMONY AND I HAVE NO TICKET TO ADMIT ME IN SPITE OF ALL THE STEPS I HAVE TAKEN TO SECURE ONE
PHILIP FROWNED BUT DID NOT REPLY
TO DO WHAT WE LIKE WHEN WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE ARE ABLE GOOD
HERS WAS ONE OF THOSE BUOYANT IMPETUOUS NATURES WHICH UPON A THEATRE WOULD LEAP OVER THE GREATEST OBSTACLES TO OBTAIN AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF APPLAUSE FROM THE SPECTATORS
THESE FANCIES WHILE THEY SINK INTO A YOUNG GIRL'S MIND MAKE HER CHEEKS SINK IN ALSO SO THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS TO FIND THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PERSONS IN THE WORLD BECOME THE MOST DISAGREEABLE AND THE WITTIEST TO BECOME THE DULLEST I THANK YOU DEAREST AURE REPLIED LA VALLIERE GENTLY
PRAY DO NOT HESITATE IF YOU SHOULD WISH IT TO HAVE MY WINDOWS BARRED EVEN THIS REPARTEE WHICH MADE MONTALAIS AND DE GUICHE SMILE REKINDLED THE PRINCE'S ANGER NO INCONSIDERABLE PORTION OF WHICH HAD ALREADY EVAPORATED IN WORDS
I SOLICITED HIS MAJESTY'S CONSENT THROUGH THE COMTE DE LA FERE AND WITHOUT ABSOLUTELY REFUSING IT HE POSITIVELY SAID IT MUST BE DEFERRED IS THE YOUNG LADY WHOM YOU LOVE UNWORTHY OF YOU THEN SHE IS WORTHY OF A KING'S AFFECTION MADAME I MEAN SHE IS NOT PERHAPS OF BIRTH EQUAL TO YOUR OWN HER FAMILY IS EXCELLENT IS SHE YOUNG BEAUTIFUL SHE IS SEVENTEEN AND IN MY OPINION EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL IS SHE IN THE COUNTRY OR AT PARIS SHE IS HERE AT FONTAINEBLEAU MADAME AT THE COURT YES DO I KNOW HER SHE HAS THE HONOR TO FORM ONE OF YOUR HIGHNESS'S HOUSEHOLD HER NAME INQUIRED THE PRINCESS ANXIOUSLY
I HAVE UTTERED COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOU BUT THEIR BITTERNESS HAS BEEN OWING TO MY PASSION FOR YOU
AND I AM SURE YOU WILL ADMIT THAT MY REMARK APPLIES WITH STILL GREATER FORCE WHEN THE LADY IN QUESTION IS A PRINCESS OF THE BLOOD ROYAL MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED BUCKINGHAM DO YOU MEAN TO INSULT MADAME HENRIETTA BE CAREFUL MY LORD REPLIED BRAGELONNE COLDLY FOR IT IS YOU WHO INSULT HER
SHE AROSE AND APPROACHED HIM SAYING YOU WROTE TO ME THIS MORNING TO SAY YOU WERE BEGINNING TO FORGET ME AND THAT I WHOM YOU HAD NOT SEEN LATELY HAD NO DOUBT CEASED TO THINK OF YOU
DE GUICHE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE MATTER FOR THERE WAS IN BRAGELONNE'S FACE A LOOK INSTINCTIVELY HOSTILE WHILE IN THAT OF DE WARDES THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE A DETERMINATION TO OFFEND
I ONLY KNOW THAT SHE LAUGHED CONTINUALLY THAT'S WELL
CHEVALIER SAID RAOUL THERE IS NO ONE HERE BUT YOURSELF WHO CAN RENDER ME A SERVICE WHAT IS IT MY DEAR VICOMTE IT IS SIMPLY TO GO AND INTERRUPT THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TO WHOM I WISH TO SAY TWO WORDS AND AS THE DUKE IS CONVERSING WITH M
HE WAS DELIBERATING A MEANS OF TAKING HIS REVENGE WHICH SEEMED DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO CARRY OUT AND WAS VEXED WITH HIMSELF FOR NOT HAVING LEARNED MORE ABOUT LA VALLIERE NOTWITHSTANDING THE INGENIOUS MEASURES HE HAD RESORTED TO IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HER WHEN SUDDENLY THE MURMUR OF A HUMAN VOICE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION
IT WAS IN THIS FRAME OF MIND THAT MADAME AND HER COMPANION REACHED THE PRECINCTS OF THE ROYAL OAK
SAINT-AIGNAN ON THE CONTRARY ADVANCED TO MEET HIM BUT AT THE FIRST WORDS INDICATING HIS WISH MALICORNE DREW BACK ABRUPTLY
AH THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH HER MADAME
THE COMTE DE GUICHE AS WE HAVE SEEN HAD YIELDED TO THE PRESSING PERSUASIONS OF MANICAMP AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE LED TO THE STABLES WHERE THEY DESIRED THEIR HORSES TO BE GOT READY FOR THEM
WELL SAID HE WHERE DO YOU INTEND TO LODGE IN THE SAME PLACE YOU DO BUT I DON'T KNOW MYSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DON'T KNOW CERTAINLY HOW IS IT LIKELY I SHOULD KNOW WHERE I SHOULD STAY HAVE YOU NOT RETAINED AN HOTEL I YES YOU OR THE PRINCE NEITHER OF US HAS THOUGHT OF IT
WHAT IS IT SAID RAOUL
IT IS NOT SAID I SUPPOSE THAT I AM IN LOVE WITH AN ABSTRACTION
YOU RESTORE ME TO LIFE AGAIN SO MUCH THE BETTER
DID YOU NOT RECEIVE A LETTER FROM ME WHAT WAS THE DATE OF THE LETTER INQUIRED THE HOST IN WHOM MANICAMP'S HESITATION HAD AROUSED SOME SUSPICION
ARAMIS DID NOT CONTRADICT HIM BUT WITH GREAT SUBMISSIVENESS SAID TO THE LANDLORD
BUT WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVES TO PUT THEM INTO EXECUTION NOTHING COMES OF THEM YOUR COURAGE FAILS SAID ATHENAIS SCORNFULLY
DE SAINT-AIGNAN HAD AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH MADAME GONE TO MEET HIM
ARAMIS OPENED THE WINDOW AND FIXING UPON THE DYING MAN A LOOK FULL OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESPECT SAID TO HIM
DO THEY LAUGH LIKE THAT EVERY DAY WHY YES MONSEIGNEUR THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE SIMPERING AND THE SAME SINGING AND STRUMMING GOING ON EVERY DAY THE GUITAR MONSEIGNEUR WAS INTRODUCED TO-DAY
YOU ARE BLUSHING AND DO NOT ANSWER ME I WAS TRYING SAID THE MARQUISE RAISING HER BEAUTIFUL EYES BRIGHTENED WITH AN INDICATION OF GROWING TEMPER I WAS TRYING TO DISCOVER TO WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ALLUDED YOU WHO ARE SO LEARNED IN MYTHOLOGICAL SUBJECTS IN COMPARING ME TO DANAE YOU WERE TRYING TO GUESS THAT SAID MARGUERITE LAUGHING
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND I DO NOT WISH TO COMPROMISE THE POOR GIRL DO NOT BE AFRAID SIRE YOU PROMISE ME THEN I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR EXCELLENT THOUGHT THE KING LAUGHING TO HIMSELF
IF I GET A FINE FOWL IT COST ME A FRANC AND A HALF
FOR IF THERE ARE NO MEN HERE THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO WOMEN YOUR OWN FRIENDS WHO DECLARE YOU TO BE ATTAINED AND CONVICTED OF BEING A COQUETTE FROM INSTINCT
AND AS IF SHE HAD RANKED ACCORDING TO HER NAME UPON THE LIST SHE HAD ONLY MONTALAIS AND LA VALLIERE NEAR HER
TRIALS OF HORSES MADE IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS THAT SKIRTED THE ROAD
A PRINCESS WHO IS TINGED WITH COQUETRY USUALLY FORMS A BRILLIANT COURT
FOR IN THAT CASE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO MUCH COME SAID DE GUICHE FORWARD GENTLEMEN AND BREAKING THROUGH THE HORSES AND ATTENDANTS HE CLEARED THE WAY FOR HIMSELF TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE THROUGH THE CROWD FOLLOWED BY THE WHOLE CAVALCADE
FOUQUET WAS JUST ON THE POINT MOREOVER OF SPEAKING IN A MORE FRIENDLY MANNER WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WHEN M
D'ARTAGNAN LATER DISCOVERS THAT ARAMIS HAS BECOME THE BISHOP OF VANNES WHICH IS COINCIDENTALLY A PARISH BELONGING TO M
DE GUICHE IS ABSENT
I PREFER A FRANKNESS THAT WOUNDS ME TO FLATTERY WHICH WOULD DECEIVE ME
THE READER GUESSES BEFOREHAND WHOM THE USHER PRECEDED IN ANNOUNCING THE COURIER FROM BRETAGNE
A MOMENT'S SILENCE ENSUED AS THE GROUP DELIGHTFUL AS EVERYTHING YOUNG AND LOVING IS DELIGHTFUL REMAINED MOTIONLESS WHILE FOUQUET AND ARAMIS CONTEMPLATED IT IN ATTITUDES AS MOTIONLESS AS LA VALLIERE AND THE KING
ONE EVENING CONTINUED SAINT-AIGNAN TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS WERE WALKING TOGETHER IN THE FOREST TALKING OF THEIR LOVE DISAPPOINTMENTS
WHY NOT IF WHAT YOU ASSERT IS UNTRUE YOU GIVE ME THE LIE AND WILL NOT DRAW YOUR SWORD I HAVE RESOLVED MONSIEUR NOT TO KILL YOU UNTIL MADAME SHALL HAVE BEEN DELIVERED SAFELY INTO HER HUSBAND'S HANDS KILL ME
ON HER SIDE MONTALAIS BELIEVED SHE DID NOT LOVE MALICORNE
OR ELSE YOU MAY TAKE BACK YOUR BREVET MONSIEUR MALICORNE
SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR MALICORNE
A REVOLUTION THROUGHOUT EUROPE IS INCLUDED IN MY PLAN SAID THE BARON
HE IS A VERY WEALTHY MAN CONTINUED MARGUERITE
WILL YOU LISTEN TO IT CAN YOU ASK ME
PRETTIER A HUNDRED TIMES MADAME--NOT OF A BETTER FAMILY
IMPOSSIBLE HE REPLIED
SO QUICKLY
WELL THAT FRIEND SPEAKS TO YOU WHAT YOU MALICORNE YES
AT THIS MOMENT AND IN THE SAME DIRECTION TOO THAT THE KING AND LA VALLIERE HAD TAKEN EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE IN THE WOOD ITSELF INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE PATH TWO MEN WERE WALKING TOGETHER UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE HEAVENS
I DID NOT TELL YOU TO RETURN COMTE CERTAINLY NOT SIRE
YOU WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF CARRYING TO NO
RAOUL OPENED ONE OF THE SIDE WINDOWS AND THEN BEING ALONE WITH LOUISE SAID TO HER
IT IS NOT BY THE TOUCH OF THE HAND THAT ONE CAN JUDGE OF AN AFFECTION LIKE YOURS
WILL YOUR MAJESTY KINDLY COMMUNICATE THEM TO US MADAME REPLIED THE KING WITH PERFECT GRACE OF MANNER I DARE NOT--YOU PERSONALLY MIGHT BE IN NO LITTLE DEGREE CONFUSED AT HAVING TO LISTEN TO CERTAIN DETAILS--BUT SAINT-AIGNAN TELLS A STORY WELL AND HAS A PERFECT RECOLLECTION OF THE VERSES
PATIENCE MONSIEUR HE SAID
BUT FOUR DAYS AGO SHE YIELDED AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE TO WRITE SAID ARAMIS HOLDING A PEN TOWARDS HIM WHICH FOUQUET TOOK SAYING
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE AND MANICAMP WERE THE ONLY PERSONS PRESENT AT THE MEAL WHICH LASTED THREE-QUARTERS OF AN HOUR WITHOUT A SINGLE SYLLABLE HAVING BEEN UTTERED
YOU CANNOT ADVANCE ANOTHER STEP WITHOUT RISKING YOUR OWN RUIN TO-DAY PERHAPS YOUR LIFE TO-MORROW WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN I HAVE DONE WITH REFLECTIONS
ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHEVALIER ENTERED DE GUICHE'S ROOMS
OR WINDFALLS IN THE SHAPE OF ANNUITIES WHICH SHE HAD WRUNG FROM THE KING BY ENTREATY AND THUS SHE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN HER CREDIT
BUT I ALSO ALWAYS HESITATE WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF REPEATING WHAT OTHERS SAY AH
SUSPECTING THAT D'ARTAGNAN HAS ARRIVED ON THE KING'S BEHALF TO INVESTIGATE ARAMIS TRICKS D'ARTAGNAN INTO WANDERING AROUND VANNES IN SEARCH OF PORTHOS AND SENDS PORTHOS ON AN HEROIC RIDE BACK TO PARIS TO WARN FOUQUET OF THE DANGER
BUT THE MODESTY AND TACT OF THE ALLUSION HAD PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT
MEN WHO ARE VERY SILLY IN MOST THINGS ARE PARTICULARLY SO IN CONFOUNDING UNDER THE TERM OF COQUETRY A WOMAN'S PRIDE AND LOVE OF CHANGING HER SENTIMENTS AS SHE DOES HER DRESS
THE LOVERS ARE DISINTERESTED ENOUGH
TYRCIS'S HEAD EVEN GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR IT BY A CONSENTING BOW FULL OF GOOD FEELING
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN THERE LIVED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN A COTTAGE OF MODEST AND UNASSUMING APPEARANCE TWO SHEPHERDS
SHE DREW A KEY FROM HER POCKET AND INSERTED IT INTO THE LOCK PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR WHICH NOISELESSLY YIELDED TO HER TOUCH AND DIRECTED THE CLERK TO CARRY THE CHEST UPSTAIRS TO THE FIRST FLOOR
AND IN EFFECT THE KING HIMSELF PROCLAIMED ITS TRUTH BY HIS EVERY THOUGHT WORD AND LOOK
FOUQUET IN THE COURTYARD TO WHOM THE COURTIERS SINCE THE FAVOR SHOWN TOWARDS HIM ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING PAID GREATER ATTENTION THAN EVER
ATHOS TURNED OUT TO BE A NOBLEMAN THE COMTE DE LA FERE AND HAS RETIRED TO HIS HOME WITH HIS SON RAOUL DE BRAGELONNE
THE WOODS INSPIRE YOU AND YOU ARE ALMOST REASONABLE THIS EVENING YOU OUGHT NOT EITHER OF YOU SAID ATHENAIS TO REGRET THE COURT AT BLOIS SO MUCH UNLESS YOU DO NOT FEEL HAPPY WITH US
BETTER FOR YOURSELF AND FOR EVERY ONE ELSE YOU JEST CHARMINGLY MADAME
BUT WHAT IS MY SELF-RESPECT IN COMPARISON WITH YOUR TRANQUILLITY IN COMPARISON WITH MY HONOR SIRE AND THAT OF OUR FAMILY YOU MEAN
MADAME WAS FILLED WITH TRIUMPH AT THE KING'S ANNOYANCE
D'HERBLAY BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT LOUVIERE OR TREMBLAY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE SECRETS OF THE BASTILE ARE NEVER HANDED OVER WITH THE KEYS OF THE GOVERNORSHIP INDEED
AND THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD ASKED THIS BREVET OF MONSIEUR WHO HAD SIGNED IT WITHOUT HESITATION
AGAIN GLANCING THEREFORE FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME AT THE BEAUTIFUL ATHENAIS WHO CARRIED INTO PRACTICE HER PREVIOUS EVENING'S THEORY OF NOT EVEN DEIGNING TO LOOK AT HER ADORER HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY WILL PERHAPS PARDON ME FOR HAVING TOO INDIFFERENTLY REMEMBERED THE VERSES WHICH THE NYMPH DICTATED TO LORET
THE BRACELET SHALL BE YOURS IF I WIN AND IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL DEIGN TO GIVE ME BUT ONE LOOK OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES NO SAID ATHENAIS IF YOU WIN THE BRACELET KEEP IT EVERY ONE FOR HIMSELF YOU ARE WITHOUT ANY PITY SAID SAINT-AIGNAN AND I WILL PUNISH YOU BY A QUATRAIN BEAUTIFUL IRIS TO MY VOWS YOU ARE TOO OPPOSED SILENCE SAID ATHENAIS YOU WILL PREVENT ME HEARING THE WINNING NUMBER NUMBER ONE SAID THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD DRAWN THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL FROM THE SPANISH LEATHER BAG
WHEREUPON MONTALAIS AND MALICORNE UTTERED A SIMULTANEOUS CRY AND SAINT-AIGNAN APPEARED
FOUQUET SHALL HAVE HIS AUDIENCE
TO MANIFEST VEXATION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD BEEN TOUCHED LIKE HAMLET BY A SWORD FROM WHICH THE BUTTON HAD BEEN REMOVED--THE SWORD OF RIDICULE
CHAPTER XL
AND IF HE SHOULD HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE AS I HAVE DONE HIM A SERVICE WHY HE WILL LET US HAVE IT NOTHING COULD BE BETTER
ARE YOU SURE QUITE SURE LET US LOOK THEN SAID THE COUNT AS HE OPENED THE LETTER AGAIN
YOU ARE CERTAINLY HANDSOMER THAN YOUR WIFE BUT DO YOU THINK ME AS HANDSOME AS BUCKINGHAM CERTAINLY AND HE THINKS SO TOO
AND A MAN SAID FOUQUET
SHE CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER THEM AND WAITED IN THE ROOM ALONE AND BARRICADED
RAOUL BEGAN BY SETTING OFF TO SEE HIS FATHER WHO HAD LEFT FOR BLOIS
BUT DURING THEIR PROGRESS AS HE OBSERVED THAT THE DUKE DEVOTED HIMSELF WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED EAGERNESS TO THE CARRIAGE-DOOR HE ASKED THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HIS INSEPARABLE COMPANION WHO IS THAT CAVALIER HE WAS PRESENTED TO YOUR HIGHNESS A SHORT WHILE AGO
IT IS THUS THAT EVERY MAN OF HONOR OUGHT TO ACT IN THIS MANNER MY DEAR GUICHE CONTINUED BRAGELONNE I ADDRESSED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
AS A KING IS MOST NATURALLY THE VERY LAST PERSON IN HIS KINGDOM WHO KNOWS WHAT IS SAID ABOUT HIM IN THE SAME WAY THAT A LOVER IS THE ONLY ONE WHO IS KEPT IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS SAID ABOUT HIS MISTRESS THEREFORE WHEN THE KING PERCEIVED MADAME WHO WAS LOOKING FOR HIM HE APPROACHED HER IN SOME PERTURBATION BUT STILL GRACIOUS AND ATTENTIVE IN HIS MANNER
THE KING TURNED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY AND WITH A COLD AND STERN GLANCE WHICH PLUNGED LIKE A SWORD RELENTLESSLY INTO THE HEARTS OF THOSE UNDER DISGRACE REPEATED I SAID RETIRE TO YOUR ESTATES ALLOWING EVERY SYLLABLE TO FALL SLOWLY ONE BY ONE
HE WAS TOLD THAT THE ROOM WAS ON THE FIRST AND THE APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR
BUT THE GENERAL TENOR OF THE INTERVIEW MIGHT CERTAINLY BE GUESSED FROM THE ANNOYED EXPRESSION OF THE KING'S FACE AS HE LEFT HER
BUT WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO REMARK MY DEAR COUNT THAT WITHOUT RANK OF SOME SORT ONE CAN HARDLY HOPE TO BELONG TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S HOUSEHOLD YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE COUNT COURT ETIQUETTE IS ABSOLUTE
I PREFER RESIDENCE IN FRANCE
YOU ARE SUCH AN EXCELLENT PAINTER MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN MADAME OH
I WILL GO AND THROW MYSELF AT THE KING'S FEET BUT BAISEMEAUX I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU TELL ME
SUDDENLY THE KING STOPPED
BUT SHE TAKES SO MUCH NOTICE OF IT OBSERVES IT TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT SHE COMPROMISES HERSELF AND I TREMBLE LEST ON OUR ARRIVAL AT PARIS M
THE KING INSTEAD OF BEING MET BY MARIA THERESA SMILING AS WAS USUAL WITH HER FOUND ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN THE GALLERY WATCHING FOR HIS RETURN WHO ADVANCED TO MEET HIM AND TAKING HIM BY THE HAND LED HIM TO HER OWN APARTMENT
HE LOOKED AT THE HOLSTERS WITH THE AIR OF A CONNOISSEUR AND SAID WITHOUT HESITATION
THAT BROUGHT YOU ILL-LUCK FOR YOU DANCED IN THE BALLET YESTERDAY IN A MOST WRETCHED MANNER
SHE ROSE AND MADE A PROFOUND REVERENCE MURMURING SOME WORDS OF THANKS FOR THE HONOR SHE WAS RECEIVING
THE KING AND MADAME HAVING BREATHED THE HORSES AND REPEATED A HUNDRED TIMES OVER SUCH REMARKS AS THE COURTIERS WHO SUPPLIED THEM WITH TALK SUGGESTED TO THEM SET OFF AT A HAND GALLOP AND THE LEAFY COVERTS OF THE FOREST RESOUNDED TO THE FOOTFALLS OF THE MOUNTED PARTY
YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME YET SIRE SAID THE MINISTER WITH A CERTAIN AFFECTED BLUNTNESS SO SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT WAS A QUESTION OF FLATTERING LOUIS'S SELF-ESTEEM WHAT USE IS THERE IN BEING AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY IF ONE CAN NO LONGER BE OF ANY USE I RESERVE YOUR SERVICES FOR A BETTER OCCASION
IN THE MORNING THERE WERE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S EXPENSES TO SETTLE
THE KING HAS JUST GIVEN HER THE BRACELETS MADAME BIT HER LIPS TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE BLOOD APPEARED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN
BESIDES HER PORTRAIT IS HERE
WHEN THE NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN WRAPPING WITH ITS STAR-COVERED MANTLE THE SEA THE HARBOR THE TOWN AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY DE GUICHE STILL EXCITED BY THE GREAT EVENTS OF THE DAY RETURNED TO HIS TENT AND SEATED HIMSELF UPON ONE OF THE STOOLS WITH SO PROFOUND AN EXPRESSION OF DISTRESS THAT BRAGELONNE KEPT HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIM UNTIL HE HEARD HIM SIGH AND THEN HE APPROACHED HIM
HE PERCEIVED IN THE DOORWAY HE WAS PASSING THROUGH THE SUPERINTENDENT COMING OUT
FOUQUET HAS NOT WOUNDED ME
THIS CONVERSATION HAS ALREADY BEEN RELATED
HE FELT THAT HE WAS THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN AND AGAIN INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY NEWS OF THE CHEVALIER IN REPLY TO WHICH HE WAS TOLD THAT NO ONE COULD TELL WHERE THE CHEVALIER WAS TO BE FOUND
HE HAD DRAWN FROM MALICORNE THREE DAYS BEFORE FIFTY PISTOLES THE PRICE OF THE BREVET OBTAINED FOR MONTALAIS
THE KING ADVANCED TOWARDS THE CANDLES OPENED THE NOTE READ THE SIGNATURE AND UTTERED A LOUD CRY
A MILLION CAN ONLY BE DRAWN AND WEIGHED IN A DAY FOUR DAYS THEN SAID COLBERT
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO CLOSE THE DOOR SAID THE JAILER
GOOD SAID MALICORNE TAKING BACK THE PAPER
SHE IS JEALOUS SAID MARGUERITE TO HERSELF
LOUIS WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN ROOMS ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT MADAME WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE WOMAN OF HIS COURT
LOUIS CONDUCTED FOUQUET TO A SMALL ROOM THAT DIVIDED HIS STUDY FROM HIS SLEEPING-APARTMENT
AND SHE HAD LISTENED TO AND OBEYED THE ROYAL VOICE HAD BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIS ENSNARING TONES
WELL HE SAID DISCRETION IS A GREAT VIRTUE SILENCE SAID FOUQUET
MALICORNE WAS LESS GENEROUS
SUCH A LETTER OUGHT NOT TO REMAIN IN EXISTENCE AGAINST US OH
LA VALLIERE RETURNED FOUQUET WHOM WE ASSUME TO BE A SCHEMER OF THE FIRST ABILITY IS SIMPLY NOTHING MORE THAN A COQUETTE WHO HOPES THAT I SHALL PAY MY COURT TO HER BECAUSE I HAVE ALREADY DONE SO AND WHO NOW THAT SHE HAS RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION OF THE KING'S REGARD HOPES TO KEEP ME IN LEADING STRINGS WITH THE LETTER
WELL THEN I SHALL STOP AT THE VILLAGE OF LITTLE ATTENTIONS AT THE HAMLET OF LOVE-LETTERS BEFORE I FOLLOW THE ROAD OF VISIBLE AFFECTION
EACH MAN HAD ENTERED AFTER HAVING GIVEN A KIND OF PASSWORD WHICH HAD AT FIRST ATTRACTED MALICORNE'S ATTENTION
MADAME KEEN-SIGHTED ENOUGH IN OTHER RESPECTS DID NOT HOWEVER AT FIRST SEE ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN IT
HELP ME TO PLACE MYSELF IN THAT ARMCHAIR THE BEARERS OF THE LITTER PLACED IT ON THE GROUND AND LIFTING THE SICK MAN UP AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE CARRIED HIM TO THE CHAIR HE HAD INDICATED WHICH WAS SITUATED AT THE HEAD OF THE BED
AND MADAME CONTINUED:--"'FANCY PRINCESS THE BANKS OF MY LITTLE STREAM HAVE JUST WITNESSED A MOST AMUSING SCENE
AND THE COURTIERS HAD NOT DARED TO EXTOL THIS STAR IN HER UPWARD PROGRESS FEARFUL TO DISGUST THE MONARCH WHOM SUCH A DULL STAR HAD FORMERLY DISPLEASED
THE MEDALLIONS WERE ANTIQUE CAMEOS OF THE GREATEST VALUE
THE LOTTERY
OTHERS AGAIN AND THEY THE LARGER NUMBER WHO IN VIRTUE OF CHARITY OR NATIONAL VANITY MIGHT HAVE RENDERED HIM ASSISTANCE DID NOT CARE TO RUN THE RISK OF INCURRING DISGRACE AND WOULD AT THE BEST HAVE INFORMED THE MINISTERS OF A DEPARTURE WHICH MIGHT END IN A MASSACRE ON A SMALL SCALE
WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WRESTLED SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU WHO WAS KING OF FRANCE,--NAY MORE--CARDINAL WHERE ARE MY ARMIES MY TROOPS MY TREASURES
IT IS QUITE UNDERSTOOD THEN THAT AFTER YOU SHALL HAVE RECEIVED SATISFACTION FROM M
SEATED AT HIS EASE IN A VELVET DRESSING-GOWN HE WROTE LETTER AFTER LETTER IN THAT FINE AND HURRIED HANDWRITING A PAGE OF WHICH CONTAINED A QUARTER OF A VOLUME
AND STATED LOOKING AT THE LADIES PRESENT WHILE HE SPOKE THAT CERTAIN POETS WERE ENGAGED TURNING INTO VERSE THE ENCHANTING DIVERSION OF THE BATHS OF VULAINES AND THAT ONE OF THEM PARTICULARLY M
I WILL GO AT ONCE TO SEE MADAME THE KING TURNED TO LOOK IN THE MIRRORS AT HIS COSTUME WHICH WAS VERY RICH AND HIS FACE WHICH WAS RADIANT AS THE MORNING
WHO IS IN LOVE WITH MADAME THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
BUT DOUBTLESS DE WARDES HAD DETERMINED TO SAY NOTHING FURTHER AND HE REMAINED IMPENETRABLE
BUT--WILL YOU BE CONVINCED BY YOUR OWN EYES HE CONTINUED WITH A SUDDEN IMPULSE
THERE WERE TWO LETTERS IN THE SAME ENVELOPE OH
BUT I ASSURE YOU THE LATTER WILL BE QUITE AS DEVOTED QUITE AS FAITHFUL AND ALTOGETHER DISINTERESTED LA VALLIERE BOWED FOR IN FACT THE VOICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT SEEMED TO CONVEY BOTH CONVICTION AND REAL DEVOTION IN ITS TONE AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO HIM SAYING I BELIEVE YOU FOUQUET EAGERLY TOOK HOLD OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S HAND
STORY OF A DRYAD AND A NAIAD
AND I HAD AN IDEA OF GETTING VERY FOND OF MY WIFE DE GUICHE LOOKED AT THE PRINCE WITH A STUPEFIED EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHICH WAS NOT ASSUMED
EVERY ONE CAN HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO M
THE QUEEN-MOTHER WITH GREATER EXPERIENCE AND CALMER JUDGMENT PERCEIVED THE EXACT POSITION OF AFFAIRS AND AS SHE DISCERNED ITS DANGER WAS PREPARED TO MEET IT WHENEVER THE PROPER MOMENT SHOULD ARRIVE
THIS ISLAND INDEED BELONGS TO HEAVEN FOR IT IS SITUATED BETWEEN TWO SEAS AND IS NOT SHOWN ON THE KING'S CHARTS
THE LATTER WITHOUT EXPRESSING ANY SURPRISE AT THE QUESTION WHICH HE PERHAPS EXPECTED ANSWERED THAT EVERY POCKET WHICH IS ALWAYS BEING DRAWN UPON WITHOUT ANYTHING EVER BEING PUT IN IT RESEMBLES THOSE WELLS WHICH SUPPLY WATER DURING THE WINTER BUT WHICH GARDENERS RENDER USELESS BY EXHAUSTING DURING THE SUMMER
REFLECT A LITTLE THERE IS NO NEED FOR REFLECTION MADAME
THE CAPTAIN SLIGHTLY SIGNED TO HIM WITH HIS HAND AS THOUGH TO RECOMMEND HIM TO BE PATIENT AND THEN LED THE WAY TO HIS APARTMENTS
YOU GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE THE FIRST CASTLE IN FRANCE I AM WELL AWARE OF THAT SAID BAISEMEAUX IN A SORROWFUL TONE OF VOICE
AS THE HEAVENS SET WITH STARS WERE PERFECTLY UNCLOUDED AS NOT EVEN A BREATH OF AIR COULD BE HEARD IN THE WOODS AND AS IF NATURE ITSELF HAD YIELDED COMPLACENTLY TO THE KING'S FANCIES THE BACK OF THE THEATER HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN
THERE WILL BE A COMPETITION FOR THEM
AND NOW M
FOUQUET NOMINATED M
FOR I HOPE NO OBSTACLE EXISTS TO YOUR FELICITY THERE IS A GREAT OBSTACLE MADAME INDEED
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE-LILAC SATIN SHOES WITH BOWS OF FLOWERS AND LEAVES IMPRISONED HIS SMALL FEET
NO SOONER HAD HE REMARKED HER PALE FACE HER EYES SO FULL OF ANIMATION HER BEAUTIFUL NUT-BROWN HAIR HER EXPRESSIVE LIPS AND HER EVERY GESTURE WHICH WHILE BETOKENING ROYAL DESCENT SEEMED TO THANK AND TO ENCOURAGE HIM AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME THAN HE WAS FOR A MOMENT SO OVERCOME THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR RAOUL ON WHOSE ARM HE LEANT HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN
DE GUICHE LOVES THIS ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE BUT SHE WILL NEVER LOVE HIM ATHENAIS LAUGHED DISDAINFULLY
ON THE CONTRARY M
IN HER EAR ANOTHER'S CARESSING VOICE NOT MINE UNCEASINGLY VIBRATES
AND IS THAT ALL ABSOLUTELY ALL MONSEIGNEUR NO ONE WAS THERE NO ONE DID YOU CONCEAL YOURSELF AS I TOLD YOU YES AND SHE RETURNED TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS AND NO ONE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE LETTER NO ONE
AND NOT ONLY HAD MADAME SEEN HIM ONCE BUT IT WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN HE WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST WHO HAD GONE TO MEET HER AND HAD ACCOMPANIED HER FROM LE HAVRE TO PARIS
LOUIS STILL LISTENED AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE IT RAN YOU ARE OF ALL THE FRENCHMEN I HAVE KNOWN THE ONE WITH WHOM I AM MOST PLEASED
AND CONSEQUENTLY YOU THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MAN IN FRANCE FOR POLISHED COURTESY OF MANNER WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I CANNOT ALLOW MY FRIEND TO BE PLACED IN A RIDICULOUS POSITION SAINT-AIGNAN BEGAN TO BITE HIS NAILS PARTIALLY FROM VEXATION AND PARTIALLY FROM DISAPPOINTED CURIOSITY
A DETESTABLE DELIGHT AT AN APPROACHING DOWNFALL UNTIRING EFFORTS TO ATTAIN THIS OBJECT MEANS OF SEDUCTION NO LESS WICKED THAN THE CRIME ITSELF--SUCH WERE THE WEAPONS MARGUERITE EMPLOYED
DE BRAGELONNE HERE LA VALLIERE STARTED AT THE NAME
THEY MET AT MASS
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WOULD NOT LOVE ME IF I WERE TO SHINE AS YOUR MOTHER SAYS OH NO SAID THE YOUNG GIRL WITH DIFFICULTY RESTRAINING HER TEARS
THE KING OFFERED MADAME HIS ARM AND THEY BOTH SELECTED AS THE CENTER OF OBSERVATION A BENCH WITH A ROOF OF BOARDS AND MOSS A KIND OF HUT ROUGHLY DESIGNED BY THE MODEST GENIUS OF ONE OF THE GARDENERS WHO HAD INAUGURATED THE PICTURESQUE AND FANCIFUL AMID THE FORMAL STYLE OF THE GARDENING OF THAT PERIOD
DO NOT BE SO SEVERE I BESEECH YOU IN FACT SAID MANICAMP WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY WISH YOUR FRIENDS TO LOSE THEIR LIVES
IN OTHER WORDS IN LOVING NO ONE BUT THE PERSON IN QUESTION OH
HE HAD JUST DERIVED FRESH INSPIRATION FROM THE ELOQUENT GLANCES OF MADAME
DO NOT OVERWHELM HIM WHILE HE IS ABSENT
CHAPTER XXV
HAVING REACHED THE CHATEAU SHE WAS ABLE THOUGH VERY WEAK TO ALIGHT FROM THE CARRIAGE AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ATHENAIS AND OF MONTALAIS TO REACH THE INNER APARTMENTS
HOW MALICORNE HAD BEEN TURNED OUT OF THE HOTEL OF THE BEAU PAON
THE CLOCK OF ST PAUL WAS STRIKING SEVEN AS ARAMIS ON HORSEBACK DRESSED AS A SIMPLE CITIZEN THAT IS TO SAY IN COLORED SUIT WITH NO DISTINCTIVE MARK ABOUT HIM EXCEPT A KIND OF HUNTING-KNIFE BY HIS SIDE PASSED BEFORE THE RUE DU PETIT-MUSC AND STOPPED OPPOSITE THE RUE DES TOURNELLES AT THE GATE OF THE BASTILE
WELL SAID PHILIP TELL ME ONE THING WHAT IS THAT WHY DOES MY WIFE RETAIN AN ENGLISH COURT ABOUT HER SAID PHILIP AS HE CROSSED HIS ARMS AND LOOKED HIS MOTHER STEADILY IN THE FACE AS IF HE WERE CONVINCED THAT SHE COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION
SUDDENLY THE DUC D'ORLEANS ENTERED HER ROOM
IT REPRESENTS YOU ON THE CONTRARY AS A VIRTUOUS BUT LOVING WOMAN DEFENDING YOURSELF WITH CLAWS AND TEETH SHUTTING YOURSELF UP IN YOUR OWN HOUSE AS IN A FORTRESS
AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE SONOROUS QUIVER HER BROWN SHOULDERS CAN BE DETECTED
FOR BOTH OF YOU MADE YOUR DECLARATIONS OF LOVE TO THE SKIES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WERE INTERCEPTED LA VALLIERE HUNG DOWN HER HEAD
MONTALAIS HAD HER TURN
SIRE SAID BRAGELONNE WITH VOICE SOFT AND MUSICAL AND WITH THE NATURAL AND EASY ELOCUTION HE INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER
A TASTE FOR ME
WHEN THE KING WAS INFORMED THAT MADAME HAD LEFT HER APARTMENTS AND HAD GONE FOR A WALK IN THE GARDENS HE COLLECTED ALL THE GENTLEMEN HE COULD FIND AND INVITED THEM TO FOLLOW HIM
DE BRAGELONNE MAY NOT DENOUNCE BOTH OF YOU FOR SHAME DE WARDES AGAIN ATTACKING DE BRAGELONNE COME COME A TRUCE TO CHILD'S PLAY REPLIED THE COUNT'S EVIL GENIUS IN AN UNDERTONE
BUT AS JEALOUSY IS THE CASE I PROMISE NOTHING IT IS JUST THE SAME AS IF YOUR MAJESTY WERE TO DESIRE ME TO HOLD MY TONGUE AND SENT ME AWAY UNHEARD FAR FROM IT
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG THEN GOING ON IN MY ABSENCE YET NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO-DAY MONSEIGNEUR WHICH IS NOT DONE EVERY DAY WHAT
FOR THAT POOR FELLOW WAS WRONGLY ENOUGH THE OBJECT OF YOUR JEALOUSY AND I THOUGHT MY WIFE MADAME HAS ALREADY REPLACED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM PHILIP WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
WHEN QUITE A CHILD HE ALWAYS FLED THERE FOR REFUGE WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER QUARRELED OFTEN AFTER HAVING STRUCK HIM WHICH CONSTITUTED THE CRIME OF HIGH TREASON ON HIS PART AFTER CERTAIN ENGAGEMENTS WITH HANDS AND NAILS IN WHICH THE KING AND HIS REBELLIOUS SUBJECT INDULGED IN THEIR NIGHT-DRESSES RESPECTING THE RIGHT TO A DISPUTED BED HAVING THEIR SERVANT LAPORTE AS UMPIRE,--PHILIP CONQUEROR BUT TERRIFIED AT VICTORY USED TO FLEE TO HIS MOTHER TO OBTAIN REINFORCEMENTS FROM HER OR AT LEAST THE ASSURANCE OF FORGIVENESS WHICH LOUIS XIV
THE PRINCESS LANDED AT THE DECORATED QUAY
WELL IT IS A GREAT PITY ADDED ARAMIS WITH ONE OF THOSE SMILES SO PECULIAR TO HIM TO SEE HOW MUCH YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE PRESENT DAY SEEK AMUSEMENT AND HOW MUCH CONSEQUENTLY THEY INCLINE TO THE MAN WHO PROCURES AND PAYS FOR THEIR FAVORITE PASTIMES BUT IF THEY AMUSE THEMSELVES AT BELL-ISLE IF THEY AMUSE THEMSELVES THROUGH THE KING'S MEANS THEY WILL ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE KING
LITTLE DISSEMBLER SAID MONTALAIS TRY AGAIN TO MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH RAOUL LOUISE BLUSHED LIKE A ROSE IN JUNE BUT INSTEAD OF REPLYING SHE RAN AND EMBRACED HER MOTHER
SHE SEEMED TO BE COMMUNING WITHIN HERSELF
THE KING SAT DOWN
IN CASE THE KING SHOULD SHOW HIMSELF OBSTINATE IN HIS FANCY THEN HE WOULD NOT PRODUCE THE DAMAGING INFORMATION HE HAD OBTAINED BUT WOULD LET LA VALLIERE KNOW THAT THIS DAMAGING INFORMATION WAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED IN A SECRET DRAWER OF HER CONFIDANT'S MEMORY
D'ARTAGNAN AND BECAUSE MY PRISONERS ARE FED LIKE AMBASSADORS WELL YOU'RE IN A FAIR WAY TO GET OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES
IT MUST BE SO FOR SEE WE ARE INTERRUPTED YES INDEED SAID HENRIETTA THEY ARE BRINGING MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE AND HER SPHINX BUTTERFLY IN GRAND PROCESSION THIS WAY IT IS PERFECTLY WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS EVENING DURING THE PROMENADE I AM TO MAKE MY ESCAPE INTO THE FOREST AND FIND LA VALLIERE WITHOUT YOU I WILL TAKE CARE TO SEND HER AWAY VERY WELL
HE WAS REVENGING HIMSELF UPON THE POOR VICTIM BEFORE HIM FOR ALL HE HAD HIMSELF SUFFERED
MEN CALL ME A COQUETTE BECAUSE THEY ARE VAIN ENOUGH TO THINK I CARE FOR THEM
MY DEAR FRIEND IF YOU WISH TO HAVE IT EARN IT WHAT MUST BE DONE FOR IT EARN IT PARBLEU AND AFTER WHAT FASHION OH
SEATED IN THIS OPEN CARRIAGE AS THOUGH UPON A THRONE AND BENEATH A PARASOL OF EMBROIDERED SILK FRINGED WITH FEATHERS SAT THE YOUNG AND LOVELY PRINCESS ON WHOSE BEAMING FACE WERE REFLECTED THE SOFTENED ROSE-TINTS WHICH SUITED HER DELICATE SKIN TO PERFECTION
HER HEART YEARNS FOR EVERYTHING HER GAZE EMBRACES
SHE MERELY BOWED HER HEAD
HE KNEW THE INFLUENCE HE EXERCISED OVER BUCKINGHAM AND THE ASCENDENCY HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER DE GUICHE AND AFFAIRS DID NOT LOOK UTTERLY HOPELESS
SO THERE IS A LABYRINTH AS WELL YES AND COMPLICATED ENOUGH TOO
BUT WHY DESIRE THAT WHICH CAN NEVER BY ANY POSSIBILITY BE OURS THE KING HIS HEAD BENT FORWARD WAS LISTENING TO WHAT LOUISE WAS SAYING
RETURN AS SOON AS YOU CAN VERY WELL
THE GROOM TOLD HIM THAT ALL THE HORSES HAD BEEN SENT AWAY
AND LASTLY CONTINUED THE PRINCESS WILL PEOPLE PERSIST IN ATTRIBUTING A WRONGFUL AFFECTION TO THE KING WHEN THE TRUTH IS WE CAN OFFER NOTHING TO EACH OTHER EXCEPT ABSOLUTE SYMPATHY FREE FROM MENTAL RESERVATION YES YES SAID THE KING HESITATINGLY
A MOMENT AFTERWARDS A MAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE WITH AN ANXIOUS RESTLESS LOOK SHREWD EXPRESSION OF THE MOUTH WITH SHORT ARMS AND HIS BACK SOMEWHAT BENT
BUT NO ONE HAVING RENDERED HIM ANY ASSISTANCE IN THIS RESPECT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY OBLIGED THEREFORE TO SUBMIT TO THE BURDEN OF HIS OWN EVIL THOUGHTS AND CAUSTIC SPIRIT
OF BELLE-ILE-EN-MER
HE IS EXTREMELY IRRITATED
YOUR LADYSHIP DOES NOT GENERALLY TAKE YOUR JEWELS WITH YOU INTO THE COUNTRY BUT THEY ARE ALL IN ORDER YOU SAY YES IN YOUR LADYSHIP'S OWN ROOM THE GOLD PLATE IN THE CHEST AND THE SILVER PLATE IN THE GREAT OAK CLOSET THE MARQUISE REMAINED SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID CALMLY LET MY GOLDSMITH BE SENT FOR HER ATTENDANTS QUITTED THE ROOM TO EXECUTE THE ORDER
AND STILL HOLDING HIS HAT IN HIS HAND HE CONDUCTED HER TO HER CARRIAGE
HE PASSED HIS LEFT ARM SAFE AND UNWOUNDED ROUND HIS BODY AND RAISED HIM UP
COME IN SAID THE KING
BUT FOR WANT OF THE POSITION YOU MERIT AT COURT YOUR PRESENCE THERE IS A WASTE OF TIME
A DEAD SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE MERRY MUSIC OF THE DANCE
YOU WISH TO ESCAPE FROM THE MERRY TUMULT AND PREFER YOUR OWN SOCIETY
BY JOVE SAID THE FORMER HIS COUNTENANCE CLEARING UP GLAD TO SEE YOU MALICORNE
YES MONSIEUR HE IS INDEED VERY WRETCHED SAID THE JAILER
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW I WAS AT FONTAINEBLEAU I NAY BE FRANK I SUSPECTED SO WELL THEN COULD YOU NOT HAVE CONTRIVED DURING THE LAST WEEK TO HAVE SEEN ME ONCE A DAY AT LEAST I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PREVENTED M
WE HAVE BEEN ON HORSEBACK FOR EIGHTEEN HOURS AT A TIME AND OUR HORSES DYING FROM EXHAUSTION OR HUNGER HAVE FALLEN BENEATH US AND YET WE HAVE LAUGHED AT OUR MISHAPS
THANK YOU GOOD LUCK ATTEND YOU SAID D'ARTAGNAN
AN IDEA HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME
I REPEAT IT ONCE MORE I AM TOO FULL OF HAPPINESS
HE SEEMED DELIGHTED WHILE HE WENT ON EATING TO DETAIN A PRINCE WHO WAS VERY IMPATIENT TO MOVE STILL AT TABLE
WHAT DOES HE SAY
THE PENSION HAS BEEN PAID
AFTER MADAME HAD TALKED FOR SOME TIME WITH DE GUICHE SHE CONVERSED WITH THE KING WHO PAID HER A VISIT REGULARLY EVERY DAY
SHE IS TALL WITH AN ASTONISHING ABUNDANCE OF BEAUTIFUL HAIR WHICH SHE FASTENS IN THE MANNER OF THE GRECIAN STATUES
CHAPTER XIX
BY THE BY SAID DE GUICHE AS THEY WERE STANDING BY THE DOOR I HAD A COMMISSION FOR YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS EXECUTE IT THEN M
ONE THING HOWEVER MUST BE REMARKED THAT CLOSE BESIDE LA VALLIERE AMONG THE NUMBER OF THE COURTIERS M
DE MAZARIN'S OWN HAND HAVE YOU THE WRITING STILL YES MY LORD
BUT REALLY AND TRULY ARE YOU SURE YOU QUITE UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF THE NAIADS THE COMTE SIRE PRETENDS TO HAVE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT OF THE DRYADS RETORTED MADAME ICILY
FOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SHARES HER ROOMS WITH HER
RAOUL DO NOT BE ALARMED I AM ACQUAINTED WITH THESE USAGES OF THE COURT
NO NO SAINT-AIGNAN--READ AND HE HANDED HIM THE NOTE
AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR YOU FOR YOUR ADMIRABLE PRESENCE FOR YOUR SINGULAR DECISION OF CHARACTER SWORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN DRAWN IN THE VERY STREETS OF THE TOWN YOU OBSERVE HOWEVER THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS TACTICS YES CERTAINLY
THE DAWN OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND AS EVERY ONE KNEW THAT THE PROMENADE WAS DOWN IN THE ROYAL PROGRAMME EVERY ONE'S GAZE AS HIS EYES WERE OPENED WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE SKY
IT IS A MEANS OF COUNTERACTING THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF M
WHO THE DEUCE CAN HAVE TO WRITE TO ME FROM CALAIS I THINK I RECOGNIZE THE HANDWRITING OF MONSIEUR LE COMTE DE WARDES OH CRIED THE CHEVALIER FORGETTING HIS INTENTION OF ACTING THE SPY IN THAT CASE I WILL COME UP AT ONCE THIS HE DID WHILE THE TWO UNKNOWN BEINGS DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF THE COURT OPPOSITE TO THE ONE BY WHICH THEY HAD JUST ENTERED
NOW LISTEN TO ME SAID HE
I SHALL WAIT FOR YOU SINCE YOUR HIGHNESS ABSOLUTELY COMMANDS IT POSITIVELY HE WILL NOT LOSE HIS HOLD SAID MANICAMP
I TOLD HIM THAT I FED MY PRISONERS TOO WELL HOW MANY HAVE YOU INQUIRED ARAMIS IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE OF VOICE
THE RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING A HUSBAND WHO IS JEALOUS AND TROUBLESOME FREE FROM RESTRAINT IN HIS CONDUCT TOWARDS US WE HAVE A LOVER ALWAYS TREMBLING IN OUR PRESENCE ALWAYS FASCINATED BY OUR ATTRACTIONS ALWAYS SUBMISSIVE
WHILST I AM ABOUT IT I MIGHT AS WELL GET EVERYBODY APPOINTED AND UPON THAT HE WENT AWAY LEAVING THE POOR LADY QUITE DISCONCERTED
I SHALL NOT HAVE ANY TIME TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF HER SHE IS POOR AND UNASSUMING YOU WILL CREATE A POSITION FOR HER AND WHETHER SHE TAMES THE KING AS HIS LADY CONFESSOR OR HIS SWEETHEART YOU WILL HAVE ENLISTED A NEW AND VALUABLE ALLY VERY GOOD SAID FOUQUET
THERE WAS LEFT THE PATERNAL STRONG BOX
I THEREFORE REPLIED TO YOU IN ORDER TO SEE MADAME YOU MUST GET A LITTLE MORE INTIMATE WITH MONSIEUR DOUBLE-DEALER THAT YOU ARE SAID THE COMTE SMILING
CALL THE SCOTCHMAN EXCLAIMED THE FRANCISCAN
HE IS DECIDEDLY BECOMING POWERFUL IN FACT COLBERT WAS ADVANCING ESCORTED BY ALL THE COURTIERS WHO REMAINED IN THE GARDENS EVERY ONE OF WHOM COMPLIMENTED HIM UPON THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE FETE
AND THE EVENT WHICH HAS NO FIXED CERTAINTY EVEN IN THE BRAIN OF HIM WHO ORIGINATED IT COULD BE TURNED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF OUR ORDER PRONTO PRONTO MURMURED THE FRANCISCAN IN SPANISH WHO SUDDENLY BECAME PALER AND LEANED UPON THE PRIEST
IT IS DANGEROUS LOUISE TO SCRAWL WITH THE POINT OF YOUR FOOT AS YOU DO UPON THE GRAVEL CERTAIN LETTERS IT IS USELESS FOR YOU TO EFFACE BUT WHICH APPEAR AGAIN UNDER YOUR HEEL PARTICULARLY WHEN THOSE LETTERS RATHER RESEMBLE THE LETTER L THAN THE LETTER B
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS INTERVAL TO SALUTE MADAME AND DE GUICHE MOST RESPECTFULLY AFFECTING TO JOIN THEM TOGETHER IN HIS REVERENCES AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE
OH THIS IS INDEED TERRIBLE WHAT IS TO HAVE A FRIEND WHO OUGHT TO SPARE ME WHO MIGHT ADVISE ME AND HELP ME TO SAVE MYSELF AND YET WHO IS UNDOING ME--IS KILLING ME THERE THERE THAT WILL DO SAID MONTALAIS
BUT AS IN ASKING A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS IT IS SINGULAR IF A MAN DOES NOT LEARN SOMETHING SAINT-AIGNAN RECKONED UPON LEARNING MUCH OR LITTLE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE IF HE QUESTIONED DE GUICHE WITH THAT EXTREME TACT AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH THAT PERSISTENCE IN ATTAINING AN OBJECT OF WHICH HE WAS CAPABLE
GUICHE ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND BRAGELONNE DE WARDES MANICAMP AND THREE OR FOUR OTHER GENTLEMEN FOLLOWED HIM
STILL RETURNED LOUIS MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MADAME HAS NO REASON NO RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS OF ME ALAS MURMURED LA VALLIERE
I DID NOT WISH TO BE THE SUBSTANCE OF SO DARK A SHADOW TO YOUR MAJESTY'S ELEGANCE SKILL AND GRACEFUL INVENTION
THIS FEELING WITH HER MUST REMAIN PASSIVE WHILST THE KING COULD NOT BUT ACT WITH ALL THE NATURAL VEHEMENCE OF THE HEATED FANCIES OF A YOUNG MAN AND OF A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS BUT TO EXPRESS A WISH TO SEE HIS WISH FULFILLED
I RECOLLECT YOU NOW SAID RAOUL
YOU DO NOT ANSWER ME LOUISE
MONSEIGNEUR DE GUICHE STAMMERED OUT
WHEN SHE FROWNS OR BENDS HER LOOKS TOWARDS THE GROUND THE SUN IS VEILED IN TOKEN OF MOURNING
THE PEARL-LIKE PALLOR OF LA VALLIERE POSSESSED A CHARM IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE
WILL YOU BEGIN WITH THIS ONE SAID BAISEMEAUX
IN OTHER WORDS YOU WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO COMMIT ANY PIECE OF FOLLY PEOPLE COMMIT WHO HAVE EITHER TOO MUCH LIBERTY OR TOO LITTLE THAT IS MY DEAR LOUISE WHAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU AT FIRST IF I HAD BEEN ABLE TO READ YOUR HEART AND I SHOULD HAVE THANKED YOU STAMMERED OUT LOUISE ALTHOUGH THE ADVICE DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO BE ALTOGETHER SOUND WAIT WAIT
ANNE OF AUSTRIA A KEEN OBSERVER LIKE ALL WOMEN AND IMPERIOUS LIKE EVERY QUEEN WAS SENSIBLE OF MADAME'S POWER AND ACQUIESCED IN IT IMMEDIATELY A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH INDUCED THE YOUNG QUEEN TO RAISE THE SIEGE AND RETIRE TO HER APARTMENTS
COLBERT HAS SAID NOTHING BUT GOOD OF YOU M
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD QUIETLY
HE PRESUMES TO MAKE PRESENTS TO HER AND SHE VENTURES TO ACCEPT THEM
AFTERWARDS WHY AFTERWARDS ACCORDING TO HIS DISPOSITION YOU WILL BE EMANCIPATED OR ENSLAVED
BUT CONTINUED THE NAIAD THE SHEPHERDESSES HAD NOTICED TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS GLIDING INTO THE WOOD AND BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON THEY HAD RECOGNIZED THEM THROUGH THE GROVE OF THE TREES AH YOU LAUGH INTERRUPTED MADAME
WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT RETIRE
EVERY ONE OF THESE TRAVELERS HAD REACHED THE HOTEL AFTER HIS OWN ARRIVAL THERE
BUT WHAT GOOD IS THERE IN YOUR TELLING ME ALL THAT IS IT NOT IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EXACT POSITION OF AFFAIRS NO NO
DE WARDES IRRITATED AT FINDING HIMSELF DRAGGED AWAY IN SO ABRUPT A MANNER BY THIS ENGLISHMAN HAD SOUGHT IN HIS SUBTLE MIND FOR SOME MEANS OF ESCAPING FROM HIS FETTERS
FOUQUET AWAITED HIS APPROACH UNMOVED AND WITH A SLIGHTLY MOCKING SMILE
RAOUL AS I BEGGED YOU TO DO WHY SHOULD I
THEN AT THE RISK OF INTERRUPTING THE PROGRESS OF THE FETE BY HIS ANNOYANCE HE FLED FROM THE SCENE TEARING HIS BEAUTIFUL COSTUME OF AUTUMN IN PIECES AND SCATTERING AS HE WENT ALONG THE BRANCHES OF VINES MULBERRY AND ALMOND TREES WITH ALL THE OTHER ARTIFICIAL ATTRIBUTES OF HIS ASSUMED DIVINITY
DE WARDES I HOPE ALL IS FINISHED BETWEEN US AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO FURTHER OCCASION TO SPEAK ILL OF ME AGAIN
AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE AS THIS LARGER APARTMENT WILL BE HIS OWN AFFAIR HE WILL SETTLE FOR IT HIMSELF CERTAINLY SAID THE LANDLORD CERTAINLY
FOUQUET IS PLAYING AT CARDS WITH THE KING
COULD YOU GET ME ADMITTED CERTAINLY DO ME THIS KINDNESS THEN I ENTREAT MOST WILLINGLY MONSIEUR
LET US GO AND LOOK WHERE I TOLD YOU IS THE PASSION THEN WHICH YOUR MAJESTY CONFIDED TO ME ALREADY FORGOTTEN OH
I'LL WAGER YOU ARE MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS OUT OF YOUR PIGEONS IN THE BASTILE WOULD TO HEAVEN THAT WERE THE CASE M
BUT FOLLOW NO ADVICE BUT MINE
MADAME ALMOST AS GREAT A COQUETTE AS ANNE OF AUSTRIA AND THE QUEEN SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS USUAL WERE SEATED BESIDE HER EACH CONTENDING FOR HER GOOD GRACES
ALL THE PRECIOUS STONES AND JEWELS OF CARDINAL MAZARIN WHICH OF COURSE THAT MINISTER COULD NOT DO OTHERWISE THAN LEAVE
THE KING HAD ALREADY MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMID THUNDERS OF APPLAUSE
DE WARDES I CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT MONSIEUR FOR THE ACTION ITSELF NEEDED REPENTANCE
YES SHE SAID I AM OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER
IT WAS IMPRUDENT SHE SAID
WHAT PRETTY FACES A BEVY OF YOUNG GIRLS AT THIS MOMENT ENTERED THE SALON CONDUCTED BY MADAME DE NAVAILLES AND TO MANICAMP'S CREDIT BE IT SAID IF INDEED HE HAD TAKEN THAT PART IN THEIR SELECTION WHICH THE PRINCE DE CONDE ASSIGNED HIM IT WAS A DISPLAY CALCULATED TO DAZZLE THOSE WHO LIKE THE PRINCE COULD APPRECIATE EVERY CHARACTER AND STYLE OF BEAUTY
THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT LOVE WAS NECESSARY VERY GOOD
DO NOT FRIGHTEN YOURSELF IN THAT MANNER SAID ATHENAIS
CHAPTER XVII
THE CARRIAGES CONTAINING THE LUGGAGE HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT ON BEFOREHAND AND IN THE EVENING HE SET OFF IN HIS TRAVELING CARRIAGE WITH HIS ATTENDANTS
NO AND YOU WILL DO ME A SERVICE MY DEAR COMTE IN KEEPING THIS REPORT TO YOURSELF AND TO THOSE WHO CIRCULATE IT AH
I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THIS GENTLEMAN CONTINUED THE TRAVELER
I BELIEVE THE POOR CHILD TO BE AS PURE AS CRYSTAL YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH JOY
AND SO THE MADAME HENRIETTE ONCE MORE RETURNED TO THE LOUVRE WITH HER HEART MORE SWOLLEN WITH BITTER RECOLLECTIONS THAN HER DAUGHTER'S WHOSE DISPOSITION WAS FICKLE AND FORGETFUL WITH TRIUMPH AND DELIGHT
UPON THIS THEY BEGAN TO REFLECT
HE LOOKED AT MANICAMP STEADILY NOT VENTURING TO SHOW HIS ANGER TOWARDS DE GUICHE
MUST DEATH WHICH IS WAITING FOR ME SWALLOW UP WITH ME THE FUTURE OF THE ORDER
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO M
SAINT-AIGNAN CONTINUED THE KING WATCH OVER MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE I BEG
4 CHAPTER XXXVI
YOU COMMISSION A MESSENGER WHO HIRES IN YOUR NAME THE WHOLE OF THE TOWN OF LE HAVRE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH COURT WHO WOULD BE SURE TO ARRIVE HERE TO MEET MADAME
IS IT NOT MY WHOLE FUTURE AND MINE MONTALAIS LOOKED AT HIM
DURING THE WEEK SEVEN TRAVELERS HAD TAKEN UP THEIR ABODE IN THE INN ALL OF THEM HAVING ARRIVED THERE THE DAY AFTER THE FORTUNATE DAY ON WHICH MALICORNE HAD FIXED HIS CHOICE ON THE BEAU PAON
MONSEIGNEUR SAID ARAMIS TOUCHING FOUQUET'S ARM
MANICAMP WENT OFF TO INFORM MALICORNE OF THE GOOD NEWS HE HAD JUST LEARNED
YOU ARE AGAIN MISTAKEN
HE IS A SHEPHERD WITH A MIND AS REFINED AS HIS HEART IS PURE
AND HER BEAUTIFUL DELICATE HANDS TREMBLED FROM TIME TO TIME AS THOUGH AT THE CONTACT OF SOME INVISIBLE TOUCH
BUT AT ALL EVENTS WOUNDED VANITY WILL RENDER THE CONQUEST AN EASIER ONE
SO THAT SO THAT THIS GARRISON CAN BE DEPENDED UPON AND IT IS A BETTER ONE THAN THE LAST GOOD THE RESULT IS IF FORTUNE FAVORS US SO THAT THE GARRISONS ARE CHANGED IN THIS MANNER ONLY EVERY TWO MONTHS THAT AT THE END OF EVERY THREE YEARS THE WHOLE ARMY WILL IN ITS TURN HAVE BEEN THERE
THE CHEVALIER DARTED IN PURSUIT OF HIM PREPARED TO SLACKEN HIS PACE AS HE APPROACHED THE UNKNOWN
SO THAT THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS HAVE PASSED INTO THEIR HANDS PRECISELY SO AND BEYOND THAT A SUM OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND PISTOLES WHICHEVER YOU PLEASE IN THREE PAYMENTS EXORBITANT YES BUT THAT IS NOT ALL WHAT BESIDES IN DEFAULT OF THE FULFILLMENT BY ME OF ANY ONE OF THOSE CONDITIONS THOSE GENTLEMEN ENTER UPON THEIR FUNCTIONS AGAIN
DE BUCKINGHAM WITTY TOO SAID THE CHEVALIER
HE HAD PURCHASED A SUBSTANTIAL CARRIAGE BUILT IN 1648 TEN YEARS AFTER THE KING'S BIRTH
HE COMPLAINED OF MADAME ABSOLVED MONSIEUR LISTENED TO WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD TO SAY OF DE GUICHE AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY LISTENED TO WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY OF BUCKINGHAM AND THEN WHEN HE SAW THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM HE LEFT HER
A MISSION
THIS LATTER PROPOSITION APPEARING TO MANICAMP RATHER PREMATURE HE PROPOSED INSTEAD THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST REST THEMSELVES
ANNE OF AUSTRIA RESTED HER CHIN UPON HER BEAUTIFUL WHITE HAND AND REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME ABSORBED BY A PRESENTIMENT THAT DISTURBED HER MIND AND BY A TERRIBLE PANG WHICH STUNG HER HEART
DO YOU KNOW BELLE-ISLE CHEVALIER INQUIRED FOUQUET
I WAS CORRECT IN SAYING YOU WERE EITHER A SAINT OR VERY MUCH RESEMBLED ONE
REALLY PHILIP SHE SAID YOU SEEM TO DISCOVER EXPRESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMBARRASSING ME AND YOUR ANGER BLINDS YOU WHILE IT ALARMS ME
THE DUKE'S ATTENDANTS SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD TRAVELED IN ADVANCE AND NOW CHARTERED A BOAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF JOINING THE YACHT WHICH HAD BEEN TACKING ABOUT IN SIGHT OR BORE BROADSIDE ON WHENEVER IT FELT ITS WHITE WINGS WEARIED WITHIN CANNON-SHOT OF THE JETTY
ALL MY HOPES IN LIFE ARE CENTERED IN YOU
I WROTE TO HIM AT THREE O'CLOCK INVITING HIM TO BE AT FONTAINEBLEAU THE FOLLOWING DAY AND HE ARRIVES AT FONTAINEBLEAU AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I AM SUFFOCATED THE CONFESSOR DARTED FORWARD TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY HUMAN STRENGTH WHICH COULD HOLD BACK THE HAND OF DEATH WHICH WAS WEIGHING DOWN THE SICK MAN
YOU HAVE NEVER YET SPOKEN TO ME IN THIS MANNER YOU HAVE NEVER YET SHOWN YOURSELF SO CONFIDENT I SHOULD RATHER SAY SO DARING BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SPEAK CONFIDENTLY TO HAVE THE LIPS UNFETTERED AND THAT IS NOW YOUR CASE YES SINCE A VERY SHORT TIME THEN SINCE YESTERDAY ONLY OH
YOU GO TO EXTREMES IN EVERYTHING AND THE LADY YOU LOVE DOES SO TOO
TYRCIS AND M
YOU KNOW HOW TO SUPPORT LOSSES SOMETIMES WHAT MONSIEUR FOUQUET A BAD PLAYER THERE IS PLAY AND PLAY MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY HOW MUCH HAVE YOU LOST INQUIRED ARAMIS WITH A SLIGHT UNEASINESS
I DO NOT ALLUDE TO THE ENORMOUS VASES FOR THE BUFFET WHICH ALONE WEIGH FIVE THOUSAND LIVRES OR TEN THOUSAND THE PAIR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MURMURED THE MARQUISE
THE LATTER KNEW THAT OF ALL PLACES A MOTHER'S HEART IS THE MOST COMPASSIONATE AND SUREST
DO NOT CONTRADICT ME SIRE SHE SAID WITH A SMILE
THE POOR LOVER HAD HEARD THE REMARK WHICH HOWEVER WAS NOT THE CASE WITH MALICORNE FOR HE WAS ALREADY BEYOND THE REACH OF THE COUNT'S VOICE
PERCEIVING AT LAST THE LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CHATEAU THEY DECIDED TO WALK TOWARDS THEM
CHAPTER IX
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER IN ORDER TO AVOID BETRAYING HIS REAL THOUGHTS DE GUICHE HAD RECOURSE TO THE ONLY DEFENSE WHICH A MAN TAKEN BY SURPRISE REALLY HAS AND ACCORDINGLY TOLD AN UNTRUTH
HE CAST AS MANY KILLING GLANCES AT MADEMOISELLE ATHENAIS AS HE HAD BOWS OF RIBBONS ON HIS STOCKINGS AND DOUBLET
I WILL BE NOT FRANK FOR I AM ALWAYS SO BUT TRUTHFUL
HUMPH MURMURED MALICORNE AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS,--"HUMPH
IN THIS WAY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS ESTABLISHED IN PROPORTION TO THE INTENSITY OF THE PASSION WHICH IS FIRST KINDLED
AND THE PRINCE FINDING HIM NOTHING MORE THAN A MERE ECHO WHICH REMAINED SILENT UNDER HIS RAILLERIES MOVED FORWARD TO INSPECT SOMEWHAT CLOSER THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WHOM HIS FIRST GLANCE HAD ALREADY PARTICULARIZED
IF WE SHOW MADAME ANY ATTENTION AND DO IT ADROITLY MONSIEUR OUGHT TO ADORE US HUM EITHER THAT OR WE ARE GREAT FOOLS
THERE IS NO HELP FOR THAT BUT THIS SUFFERING IS SWEETENED FOR HIM
YOU ARE SPEAKING OF MADAME THEN INQUIRED THE QUEEN-MOTHER WITH A FEELING OF THE LIVELIEST CURIOSITY
EVERY HEAD BOWED LOW BEFORE HIS MAJESTY THE LADIES BENDING LIKE FRAIL MAGNIFICENT LILIES BEFORE KING AQUILO
SIXTY THOUSAND LIVRES SIRE SAID ARAMIS
HE THREW HIMSELF INTO THE LARGEST OF HIS ARM-CHAIRS WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIMSELF IN THE GLASS
FOUQUET THAT I MIGHT WRITE TO YOU I UNDERSTAND SAID ARAMIS SMILING BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT
THE BRACELETS ARE YOURS AND THE KING BEGS YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THEM AND AS WITH A MOVEMENT ALMOST RESEMBLING TERROR LA VALLIERE EAGERLY HELD OUT THE CASKET TO THE KING THE KING GENTLY PUSHED BACK HER TREMBLING HAND
IF WE SAY THEN THAT THE REPAST OCCUPIED AN HOUR AND THE TOILETTE TWO HOURS EVERYBODY WAS READY ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
NOTHING IS SO CERTAIN AS A WELL SETTLED IDEA OF SUPERIORITY TO PROVE THE INFERIORITY OF THE MAN WHO HAS THAT OPINION OF HIMSELF
SINCE THEY ARE JEALOUS OF YOU DIVIDE THEIR SUSPICIONS FOR THE MAN WHO DISTRUSTS TWO RIVALS DOES NOT OBJECT TO EITHER IN PARTICULAR SO THAT MADAME BY THIS CLEVER DIVERSION DECIDED HIM
IT IS REPEATED SAINT-AIGNAN INQUIRINGLY
AND A FACE WITH NO EXPRESSION IN IT OFFERS LITTLE OR NO INTEREST BUT A BOARDER AT FIFTEEN FRANCS IS ALWAYS INTERESTING BY THE BY I FORGOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT
BURNING WITH DESIRE WHEN SHE ADVANCED TO TEMPT HIM HE HAD THE ART TO APPEAR ICE PERSUADED THAT IF HE OPENED HIS ARMS SHE WOULD RUN AWAY LAUGHING AT HIM
FOR IT IS POSITIVE HE SAID THAT THAT VERY AILMENT IS OF THE GREATEST SERVICE TO ME IN ORDER TO ENABLE ME TO GET RID OF THE OTHER WELL AND JUDICIOUSLY REMARKED HENRIETTA REPLIED THE KING SMILING
AFTER THE AUSTERE LESSON ADMINISTERED TO DE WARDES ATHOS AND D'ARTAGNAN TOGETHER DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE WHICH LED TO THE COURTYARD OF THE PALAIS ROYAL
DE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE
NO NO SHE SAID THE KING CANNOT HAVE HEARD
THE PRINCE PAID HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE BUCKINGHAM DEVOTED HIMSELF TO MADAME CHALAIS AND MADEMOISELLE DE LAFAYETTE WHOM MADAME ALREADY DISTINGUISHED BY HER NOTICE AND WHOM SHE HELD IN HIGH REGARD
MALICORNE STILL PROTECTED BY MONTALAIS WHO PURPOSELY WIDENED OUT HER DRESS GLIDED BEHIND THE HANGING TAPESTRY
ADIEU MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS SAID MANICAMP JUMPING TO THE GROUND
DE BAISEMEAUX FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXIST THE DEUCE IT DOESN'T OR IF IT DOES EXIST IT IS ONLY IN YOUR OWN IMAGINATION
THE FIRST DAY OF HIS ABSENCE MONSIEUR HARDLY INQUIRED ABOUT HIM FOR HE HAD DE GUICHE WITH HIM AND EXCEPT THAT THE TIME GIVEN TO CONVERSATION WITH MADAME HIS DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE RIGOROUSLY DEVOTED TO THE PRINCE
MY DEAR CHILD A WOMAN IS A QUEEN DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD NATURE PERMITS HER TO ENJOY SOVEREIGN POWER--FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE
I WAS REPROACHED THE OTHER DAY FOR NOT KNOWING WHO MY MOTHER WAS ATHOS TURNED PALE
THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY SEEMED SUDDENLY CHILLED
AND I BEG YOU TO RECEIVE THE EXPRESSION OF MY OWN BELIEVE ME MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE DUKE THAT IF I QUIT THE COURT OF FRANCE BECAUSE YOU ARE RECALLED
HE COMES TO SEE ME THAT IS ALL IT IS ALL VERY WELL
NEAR THE COAST ARAMIS AGAIN BOWED
I APPROVE EVERYTHING ATHENAIS HAS JUST SAID
THERE IS QUITE ROOM ENOUGH AND I WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO BE ALLOWED TO SIT DOWN BESIDE YOU NO NO
WHEREABOUTS IS THE ONE YOU ARE SPEAKING OF LOOK SAID BAISEMEAUX GOING TO THE WINDOW
BUT--THE BENEFIT WILL BE I HOPE IN PROPORTION WITH THE EXPENSE AND MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WILL BRING ME BACK MORE THAN MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS OR ELSE,--OR ELSE MY NAME IS NOT MALICORNE
I HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE TOO OF MY MOTHER SUFFERING MUCH
BUT HAVE YOU NOT SEEN M
AM I NOT STILL GREATER
THE OUTRIDERS SET OFF ACCORDINGLY BEFORE THE OTHERS
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LETTER HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO INTERVIEW
D'ARTAGNAN BRINGS HIS FRIENDS OUT OF RETIREMENT TO SAVE THE THREATENED ENGLISH MONARCH BUT MORDAUNT THE SON OF MILADY WHO SEEKS TO AVENGE HIS MOTHER'S DEATH AT THE MUSKETEERS HANDS THWARTS THEIR VALIANT EFFORTS
AND YET POOR DE WARDES IS NOT DEFICIENT IN ABILITY
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LOSE GRIMAUD YOU SHALL HAVE ONE OF MY MUSKETEERS TO CARRY A TORCH FOR YOU
PROFIT BY THE OCCASION WHILE YOUR PEDAGOGUE IS ABSENT DE GUICHE COULD NOT RESIST
A CHARITABLE FRIEND HOWEVER TOOK UPON HERSELF TO SPREAD THE NEWS
AND THEN MONSIEUR MOVED AWAY IN THE SAME DIRECTION BY WHICH HE HAD APPROACHED
DE WARDES AS I AN OLD OFFICER DID AND SAID JUST NOW TO YOUR BOY'S MOUSTACHE AND IF I REFUSE INQUIRED DE WARDES
BADLY LODGED WITH HER
BUT BE CAREFUL SAINT-AIGNAN I HAVE CONFIDED MY SECRET TO NO ONE BUT YOU AND IF ANY ONE SHOULD SPEAK TO ME ABOUT IT I SHALL KNOW WHO HAS BETRAYED MY SECRET YOU ARE ANGRY SIRE NO
THE KING DISMOUNTED FROM HIS HORSE A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS IMITATED BY ALL THE COURTIERS AND OFFERED HIS HAT TO MADAME WHOSE RICH RIDING-HABIT DISPLAYED HER FINE FIGURE WHICH WAS SET OFF TO GREAT ADVANTAGE BY THAT GARMENT MADE OF FINE WOOLEN CLOTH EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER
THE KING IS NOT ONE UPON WHOM OUR POOR EYES HAVE A RIGHT TO HINGE THEMSELVES THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED LA VALLIERE
HE HAD HARDLY GONE TEN PACES WHEN A SECOND WAVE RUSHING ONWARDS HIGHER MORE FURIOUS AND MENACING THAN THE FORMER STRUCK HIM AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS CHEST THREW HIM OVER AND BURIED HIM BENEATH THE WATER
BUT YOU WILL THANK ME WHEN YOU GET THERE LET US GO THEN WAIT UNTIL I HAVE SUMMONED THE JAILER SAID BAISEMEAUX AS HE STRUCK THE BELL TWICE
THE CHEVALIER ENTERED THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENTS AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE CAME IN HERSELF
DE BRAGELONNE IS MY FRIEND YOU INSULT M
HE SOUGHT IT AND THE HURRIED DEPARTURE OF THE CROWD WHICH HAD BEEN SO JOYOUS BEFORE HE ARRIVED AND WAS SO DISTURBED BY HIS ENTRANCE FURNISHED HIM WITH A PRETEXT
I PREFER TO DIE FROM LOVE THAN TO LIVE FOR FRIENDSHIP COMTE OH
MANICAMP WAS ENGAGED IN DEVOTED ATTENDANCE ON THE PRINCESS WHO ALREADY TREATED HIM WITHOUT RESERVE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS VERSATILE FANCY HIS FRANK COURTESY OF MANNER AND CONCILIATORY DISPOSITION
AS FOR MADAME SHE CONCEALED HERSELF IN THE THICKET LEANING HER BACK AGAINST A GIGANTIC CHESTNUT-TREE ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH HAD BEEN CUT IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO FORM A SEAT AND WAITED THERE FULL OF ANXIETY AND APPREHENSION
SIRE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT YOU MUST HAVE PERCEIVED IT
IT IS THAT LATIN THAT BOTHERS ME--THAT TERRIBLE MINE OF ETYMOLOGIES
AND YET SAID LOUIS XIV IT WAS COLBERT HOWEVER THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS ECONOMY HAD THE ARRANGEMENT OF MY FETES HERE AT FONTAINEBLEAU
HENRIETTA GAVE A SIDE GLANCE FROM TIME TO TIME AT THE KING
PEOPLE WERE NOT SENT TO THE BASTILE FOR JOKES AGAINST M
I HAVE GOOD NEWS TO TELL YOU SHE SAID TO HER
ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER SHE ADMIRED THE SIZE OF THE RUBIES AND THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DIAMONDS
AND MORE THAN THAT IT WAS THE COMTE WHO HAD BEEN CHARGED WITH THE NEGOTIATION OF THE MARRIAGE BY MEANS OF WHICH THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF HENRY IV
YES YES IT IS TRUE SAID DE GUICHE UNABLE TO UTTER MORE AND FALLING EXHAUSTED UPON THE COUCH
THE MAGPIES AND THE JAYS FLUTTERED AWAY UTTERING THEIR GUTTURAL CRIES BENEATH THE WAVING AVENUES OF OAKS
WELL SAID MANICAMP AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU
OTHER INTERESTS AND OTHER PRIDES WERE IN AGITATION IN ALL THE PARTS OF THE CASTLE INTO WHICH A LIVING SOUL COULD PENETRATE
THERE I TRUST YOU ARE BOARDED AND LODGED AND GET YOUR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS SALARY BESIDES ADMITTED WHETHER THE YEAR BE GOOD OR BAD THERE ARE FIFTY PRISONERS WHO ON THE AVERAGE BRING YOU IN A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR EACH I DON'T DENY IT WELL THERE IS AT ONCE AN INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS
THEY CHRONICLED THE ADVENTURES OF A YOUNG MAN NAMED D'ARTAGNAN WHO UPON ENTERING PARIS BECAME ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EMBROILED IN COURT INTRIGUES INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND ILL-FATED AFFAIRS BETWEEN ROYAL LOVERS
LISTEN MONTALAIS SAID HE WITHOUT HEEDING WHETHER THAT FAMILIARITY PLEASED HIS MISTRESS OR NOT
DE MALICORNE WHO TOLD YOU THIS YES MONSIEUR HE LIKES YOU THEN NO MONSIEUR IT IS MONSIEUR THAT HE LIKES WHY BECAUSE HE WISHES TO BELONG TO HIS HOUSEHOLD AND MOST CERTAINLY HE SHALL
HE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR TWENTY YEARS AND HAS NEVER MADE THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE AND YET ADDED FOUQUET LAUGHING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY ENOUGH FOR HIM TO HAVE DONE SO STILL CALL HIM BACK
I HAVE TWENTY PISTOLES LEFT IN THIS PURSE AND AS SOON AS WE REACH THE ADMIRAL'S VESSEL THEY SHALL BE YOURS THE SAILORS BENT THEMSELVES TO THEIR OARS AND THE BOAT BOUNDED OVER THE CREST OF THE WAVES
HE HAD HARDLY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR WHEN THE FRANCISCAN FIXED A PENETRATING LOOK UPON HIM AND SHAKING HIS HEAD MURMURED--"A WEAK MIND I SEE
THE JAILER WAS THE FIRST TO ENTER
I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT IF EVER OPPORTUNITIES HAD BEEN MET WITH MY FAMILY'S ACTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN AS LOFTY AS THEIR LOYALTY WAS FIRM
WELL THEN AND MONSIEUR PAUSED
AND UPON THAT THEY BEGAN TO ASCEND
DE GUICHE IN HIS ANXIETY TO PREVENT ANY FRESH ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE DUKE AND BUCKINGHAM IN HIS DESIRE TO AWAKEN IN THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS A SOFTER REMEMBRANCE OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH THE RECOLLECTION OF MANY HAPPY DAYS BELONGED
CHAPTER XLVI
TO-DAY IT IS A SNARE TO-MORROW IT WOULD BECOME A JEST AND MOCKERY THE NEXT DAY IT WOULD MEAN DEATH ITSELF LA VALLIERE STARTED AGAIN AND BECAME IF POSSIBLE STILL PALER
IN A LOW CHAMBER NEAR A LARGE WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE GARDENS LA VALLIERE RECLINING IN A LARGE ARMCHAIR WAS INHALING DEEP DRAUGHTS OF THE PERFUMED EVENING BREEZE
AND MONSIEUR COLBERT HOLDS HIS WEAKNESS AND HIS PASSIONS IN HIS VILLAINOUS GRASP YOU ADMIT THAT YOU FEAR HIM I DO NOT DENY IT I THAT CASE I AM LOST WHY SO MY ONLY INFLUENCE WITH THE KING HAS BEEN THROUGH THE MONEY I COMMANDED AND NOW I AM A RUINED MAN NOT SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NOT SO DO YOU KNOW MY AFFAIRS BETTER THAN MYSELF THAT IS NOT UNLIKELY IF HE WERE TO REQUEST THIS FETE TO BE GIVEN YOU WOULD GIVE IT OF COURSE BUT WHERE IS THE MONEY TO COME FROM HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN WANT OF ANY OH
SUGGEST AT LEAST SOMETHING ELSE IN ITS STEAD
I AM IT IS ODD THEN THAT YOU ARE NOT MORE ACCUSTOMED TO ALL THIS ARAMIS PERCEIVED THAT TO AVOID GIVING RISE TO ANY SUSPICIONS HE MUST SUMMON ALL HIS STRENGTH OF MIND TO HIS ASSISTANCE
PROVIDED THAT IT IS NOT ALREADY TOO LATE SAID ARAMIS
HAVE I OFFENDED YOU AGAIN SAID DE GUICHE
ACT THEREFORE ACCORDINGLY AND YOU WISH TO KNOW MY REAL STATE WELL SAID THE PHYSICIAN IT IS A BRAIN FEVER WHICH HAS REACHED ITS HIGHEST DEGREE OF INTENSITY THERE IS NO HOPE THEN INQUIRED THE FRANCISCAN IN A QUICK TONE OF VOICE
ACCUSTOMED TO THE SET FORM OF ORDINARY PHRASES HIS EAR LIKE THAT OF ALL MEN WHO EXERCISE AN INCONTESTABLE SUPERIORITY OVER OTHERS MERELY SELECTED FROM THE CONVERSATIONS HELD IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS THE INDISPENSABLE WORD WHICH REQUIRES REPLY
MADAME HAS NOT EVEN A WISH TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO TELL YOU CRIED LA VALLIERE
DON'T DECEIVE YOURSELF IT IS INDEED ME FOR WHOM THIS HONOR IS INTENDED THE OPPORTUNITY IS A GOOD ONE THEN DO YOU THINK SO PRAY GO WELL I WILL DE GUICHE HAD NOT REMOVED HIS EYES FROM RAOUL WHO MADE A SIGN TO HIM THAT ALL WAS ARRANGED
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAVING LEFT--I NOW KNOW WHY AND BY WHOSE MEANS--I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY TRANQUILLITY
YOU PRETEND THAT I AM IN LOVE DO YOU NOT SO IT IS SAID VERY WELL
HE DESIRED THAT A COUPLE OF HORSES SHOULD BE SADDLED ONE FOR HIMSELF AND THE OTHER FOR HIS VALET
YOU HAVE EMBRACED ME ONCE WITHOUT LAUGHING AND THAT IS ALL I WANT ALL SAID THE PROUD AND COQUETTISH MONTALAIS IN A TONE THROUGH WHICH THE WOUNDED PRIDE WAS VISIBLE
THE QUEEN AND MADAME MUST LIKE THE OTHERS HAVE WITNESSED THIS EXAGGERATED COURTESY OF THE KING
FOR YOU KNOW THAT THE TENDER PASSION IS SUBDIVIDED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS
THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE TWO SPECTATORS OF THIS SCENE HE SAID
IT PLEASES FATE TO DISAPPOINT ME IN EVERYTHING
AT WHICH D'ARTAGNAN BOWED
I YOUR PERSECUTOR
I IMPOSE HER UPON YOU AND YOU MUST SUBMIT OH
SOME DIE YOUNG SOME REACH OLD AGE I WILL NOT HARBOR ANY SORROWFUL IDEAS DUKE
I SHOULD HESITATE TO SEND UNDER FIRE A MARRIED MAN OR A FATHER OF A FAMILY
COLBERT APPROACHED AND AFTER HAVING BOWED TO FOUQUET WITH ALL THE FORMALITY OF RESPECTFUL POLITENESS HE SEEMED TO TAKE UP A POST BESIDE LA VALLIERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENTERING INTO CONVERSATION WITH HER
I THEREFORE ABANDON THE PLACE TO YOU FOR I HAVE NO MEANS OF DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST SUCH MONOMANIAS SHE AROSE AND LEFT MONSIEUR A PREY TO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT TRANSPORT OF PASSION
D'ARTAGNAN STILL WITH THE SAME SMILE TOOK THE PLACE WHICH RAOUL HAD ABANDONED TO HIM
THIS GIRL THEREFORE WHO IN STRICTNESS COULD NOT LAY CLAIM TO BEAUTY OR BIRTH OR GREAT INTELLIGENCE--WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED BY MADAME HERSELF ON ACCOUNT OF HER UNPRETENDING POSITION HAD NOT ONLY AROUSED THE KING'S REGARD BUT HAD MOREOVER TREATED HIM WITH DISDAIN--HE THE KING A MAN WHO LIKE AN EASTERN POTENTATE HAD BUT TO BESTOW A GLANCE TO INDICATE WITH HIS FINGER TO THROW HIS HANDKERCHIEF
HE NEEDS NOTHING MORE THAN PRAYERS AND THE BURIAL BESTOWED UPON THE PIOUS DEAD
I HAVE TRIED BUT IN VAIN TO OVERCOME THE FEELING YOU SAW DAWN IN ME INCREASE AND TAKE ENTIRE POSSESSION OF ME
YES THE KING SAID LOUIS SMILING
I HAVE SOME PROPERTY THAT MY BROTHER GAVE ME ON MY MARRIAGE
I DO NOT WISH TO WREST YOUR SECRET FROM YOU AND SO LET US TALK NO MORE ABOUT IT AT THIS MOMENT A DULL HEAVY RUMBLING WAS HEARD WHICH SUDDENLY DEVELOPED INTO A VIOLENT CLAP OF THUNDER
BUT ADDED BUCKINGHAM RAISING HIS VOICE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HEAR HIM,--"BUT I RESEMBLE THAT DWELLER IN THE EAST WHO TURNED MAD AND REMAINED SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS OWING TO A DELIGHTFUL DREAM THAT HE HAD HAD BUT WHO ONE DAY AWOKE IF NOT COMPLETELY CURED IN SOME RESPECTS RATIONAL AT LEAST
GOOD DAY DE GUICHE GOOD DAY EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE
DRIVE ME AWAY CURSE ME DENOUNCE ME YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY RIGHT
WHO A LITTLE UNEASY AT FINDING HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY PERSONS OF GOOD BIRTH AND NOT A LITTLE DISCOURAGED BY MONTALAIS'S BANTERING GLANCES HAD DESCRIBED A CIRCLE AND BY DEGREES SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW PACES FROM THE PRINCE BEHIND THE GROUP OF MAIDS OF HONOR AND NEARLY WITHIN REACH OF MADEMOISELLE AURE'S VOICE SHE BEING THE PLANET AROUND WHICH HE AS HER ATTENDANT SATELLITE SEEMED CONSTRAINED TO GRAVITATE
FOR THE EVENINGS PASSED IN HER APARTMENTS ALWAYS HAD THAT PERFECT CHARM ABOUT THEM WHICH THE QUEEN THAT PIOUS AND EXCELLENT PRINCESS HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFER UPON HER REUNIONS
BUT I AM ANNOYED ALL THESE THINGS YOU REPROACH YOUR WIFE WITH ARE PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND SO LONG AS YOU HAVE NOTHING OF GREATER IMPORTANCE YET LISTEN
FORGIVE ME I OUGHT TO SAY OF THE THREE SHEPHERDESSES
WRITE SAID HE
WHAT HAVE I BETRAYED YOU HAVE BETRAYED YOURSELF SAID THE QUEEN IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
I WILL SAY ALMOST A COMPANION SO ACCUSTOMED HAD WE BEEN TO PASS OUR DAYS TOGETHER WITH OUR OTHER FRIENDS UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WATER AT ST JAMES'S BUT VILLIERS WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU A PRETEXT
IF MY HUSBAND INTENDED TO PUT ME ON THE WRONG SCENT WITH REGARD TO ANOTHER WOMAN ONE THING WOULD REASSURE ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHAT WOULD THAT BE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SEE THAT HE NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THE WOMAN IN QUESTION EXACTLY
BUT NO I PREFER TO RETURN TO LONDON
DEATH IS APPROACHING
IT IS NOT RACINE'S OR MOLIERE'S BUT LA FEUILLADE'S
BUT IF THE KING HAS NOT RETAINED ANY RECOLLECTION OF THEM HOW COULD I POSSIBLY REMEMBER MADAME DID NOT RECEIVE THIS SHORTCOMING OF THE COURTIER VERY FAVORABLY
YOU LAUGH AS I DO AT THIS POOR SILLY GIRL DO YOU NOT LOUISE I?--OH
DE BRAGELONNE WE DIE TO SAVE OUR FRIENDS I KNOW IT WELL DUKE REPLIED RAOUL
WHEN A MAN IS OUT CAMPAIGNING AS WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER AND HE SETS OFF ALONE AND UNACCOMPANIED FOR A SKIRMISH IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT HE MAY MEET WITH A PARTY OF FIVE OR SIX FORAGERS AND ALTHOUGH ALONE HE DEFENDS HIMSELF
NOW WE ARE COMING TO THE REAL POINT AT LAST AND NOT WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTY
THE SALT WATER AND THE FINE SAND HAD GOT INTO HIS WOUNDS AND CAUSED HIM THE ACUTEST PAIN
CHAPTER LIX
MALICORNE YOU SHALL HAVE THE POST YOU WANT OR I WILL FORFEIT MY NAME AH
HIS LOOK HOWEVER DID NOT PENETRATE--NAY SOUGHT NOT TO PENETRATE--BEYOND THOSE TEARS
ACCIDENTALLY I CONFESS BUT STILL I LISTENED--SO THAT I HEARD ONLY TOO WELL MY SISTER COMPLAIN OF THOSE FAMOUS BATHS OF MADAME AH
THE ONLY REPLY MADAME CONDESCENDED TO MAKE WAS BY SLIGHTLY RAISING HER SHOULDERS AND AS HER LADIES OF HONOR HAD DISCREETLY RETIRED WHILE THE CONVERSATION LASTED SHE RECALLED THEM BY A LOOK
SO FIFTY FRANCS PER DAY FOR A PRINCE OF THE BLOOD THIRTY-SIX FOR A MARECHAL OF FRANCE BUT YOU HAVE AS MANY MARECHALS OF FRANCE I SUPPOSE AS YOU HAVE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ALAS
IN THAT CASE WE HAVE BOTH THE SAME THING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU THEN YOU WISH ME TO BEGIN YES FOR I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL WELL THEN AS SOON AS I RETURNED I FOUND MY MOTHER WAITING FOR ME AND SHE LED ME AWAY TO HER OWN APARTMENTS THE QUEEN-MOTHER SAID MADAME WITH SOME ANXIETY THE MATTER IS SERIOUS THEN INDEED IT IS FOR SHE TOLD ME
THIS TIMIDITY OF BEARING RESTRAINED HIM WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ORDINARY POLITENESS AND NO WOMAN COULD BOAST OF HAVING ANY PREFERENCE SHOWN HER BEYOND THAT SHOWN TO OTHERS
I CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE PROGRESS OF A SUCCESS ALREADY MORE THAN HUMAN ARAMIS SMILED AS HE FIXED HIS KIND AND PENETRATING GLANCE UPON HIM
IF THIS LETTER DID NOT REACH ITS PROPER DESTINATION CONFESS IT
BUT THERE IS THAT EXCELLENT SAINT-REMY WHO SOMEWHAT DAMAGES THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
LET US EXPLAIN NOTWITHSTANDING APPEARANCES HOW THERE WERE IN FACT ONLY TWO
PRAY COME WITH ME THEN AND AM I TO BE ABANDONED THEN CRIED MALICORNE
HE OUGHT TO HAVE A KEY OF SOME SORT IN HIS POSSESSION
RAOUL ENDEAVORED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CONVERSATION TURN UPON THIS SUBJECT IN DE WARDES'S PRESENCE WHO HAD DURING THE WHOLE JOURNEY BEEN EXCEEDINGLY ANNOYED AT THE SUPERIOR POSITION TAKEN BY BRAGELONNE AND ESPECIALLY BY HIS INFLUENCE OVER DE GUICHE
GO HE SAID
I CONFIDE THEM TO YOU IN YOUR CHARACTER OF A CONFESSOR VERY WELL SAID THE PRIEST SEATING HIMSELF ON THE CHAIR WHICH THE FRANCISCAN HAD WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY JUST LEFT TO LIE DOWN ON THE BED
YOU ARE LOOKING VERY WELL,--ARE YOU SO QUITE WELL I THANK YOU MONSIEUR REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
IF I HAD ONLY SEEN HER I SHOULD HAVE DECLARED IT TO BE A VISION BUT I SPOKE TO HER YOU ARE POSITIVE THEN YES
MANICAMP FOR THEY WILL BE TORN MY OPINION SAID MANICAMP WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE OF MALICORNE'S LAMENTATIONS IS THAT THE BEST THING TO BE DONE IS TO GO AND LOOK FOR DE GUICHE WITHOUT DELAY FOR BY AND BY PERHAPS I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO HIS APARTMENTS THAT IS MY OWN OPINION TOO REPLIED MONTALAIS
I TELL YOU THE KING HAS TAKEN UP THE AFFAIR BAH SAID THE CHEVALIER THE KING LIKES DE GUICHE AND PARTICULARLY HIS FATHER
HIS EMINENCE THE CARDINAL MAZARIN DID NOTHING ELSE FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HUSH HUSH DE WARDES SAID THE COUNT
SIGN IT SAID THE LATTER
I DO LOVE YOU YOU I HAVE LOVED YOU SIRE FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY I EVER SAW YOU
HAPPY ARE THE PRISONERS WHO CAN GET ONLY HALF A BOTTLE OF SUCH BURGUNDY EVERY DAY ALL THOSE AT FIFTEEN FRANCS DRINK IT SAID BAISEMEAUX
LOUIS THOUGHT OF MADAME BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD STUDIOUSLY THOUGHT OF HIMSELF
MY OWN PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SINCE YOURS ARE CONCERNED
MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE HE SAID TO ME YOU WILL CALL UPON M
WHILE TRYING TO RECALL IT HALF-DREAMILY YET HALF-IRRITATED AT HIS CONVERSATION WITH DE WARDES THE THREE YOUNG MEN SET OUT ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE PALAIS ROYAL WHERE MONSIEUR WAS RESIDING
THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHILD TWELVE YEARS OLD AND A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WELL WHAT IS YOUR OPINION MY OPINION IS THAT THE PORTRAIT MUST BE FLATTERING MY LORD OF THAT SAID THE PRINCE TRIUMPHANTLY THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
THEN EXHAUSTED BY THE EFFORT HE FELL BACK ON HIS BED MURMURING THE NAME OF DR GRISART
FROM M
THE DUC D'ORLEANS UTTERED A CRY OF DELIGHT ON PERCEIVING THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE
NO CONSOLATION HOWEVER GENTLE AND AFFECTIONATE CAN AFFORD ME RELIEF DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR MOTHER DUKE REPLIED THE QUEEN WITH A WINNING SMILE
M D'ARTAGNAN WILL SOLICIT THE KING'S PERMISSION TO MEASURE SWORDS WITH YOU
THEN WHEN ALL THE COURTIERS WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE WALK--WHEN EVERY ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE EXTRAORDINARY MARK OF DEFERENCE WITH WHICH HE HAD TREATED THE YOUNG GIRL BY REMAINING STANDING AND BARE-HEADED DURING THE STORM--HE OFFERED HER HIS ARM LED HER TOWARDS THE GROUP WHO WERE WAITING RECOGNIZED BY AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD THE RESPECTFUL SALUTATIONS WHICH WERE PAID HIM ON ALL SIDES
YOU KNEW THEN YOU WERE IN DISGRACE WITH ME ALAS
AND SINCE YOU DRIVE YOUR INHUMANITY SO FAR AS TO WISH TO MAKE ME RENOUNCE MY CONDITION AS A MAN I DECLARE IT OPENLY
YOU MUST BE MARRIED IN ORDER TO BE RESPECTED MARRIED YES HERE IS MY HAND LOUISE
TELL ME THEIR VALUE M
THIS ONLY WAS WANTING TO DESTROY ME STAMMERED DE GUICHE
THESE JEALOUS FITS WITH RESPECT TO ANY WOMAN ARE NOT BECOMING IN ONE WHO IS NEITHER HER LOVER NOR HER HUSBAND
I HAVE SAID SO ALREADY AND I REPEAT IT MY DEAR BAISEMEAUX WELL LET US SET OFF THEN SAID THE GOVERNOR A LITTLE BEWILDERED PARTLY FROM THE WINE HE HAD DRUNK AND PARTLY FROM ARAMIS'S PRAISES
I INFORMED YOUR MAJESTY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE YOU DID SO
COLBERT M
HE DOES NO PREJUDICE TO LOVE ITSELF
TELL THE VICOMTE THAT AT MY LEVEE TO-MORROW MORNING I WILL SPEAK TO HIM
HOW MUCH PER DAY FOUR LIVRES MONSIEUR WHICH WILL MAKE TWELVE LIVRES FOR THE THREE DAYS I HAVE BEEN HERE YES MONSIEUR HERE ARE YOUR TWELVE LIVRES THEN BUT WHY SETTLE NOW BECAUSE SAID MALICORNE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND RESORTING TO HIS FORMER AIR OF MYSTERY BECAUSE HE SAW THAT THE MYSTERIOUS HAD SUCCEEDED BECAUSE IF I HAD TO SET OFF SUDDENLY TO DECAMP AT ANY MOMENT MY ACCOUNT WOULD BE SETTLED YOU ARE RIGHT MONSIEUR I MAY CONSIDER MYSELF AT HOME THEN PERFECTLY SO FAR SO WELL
I THINK IT MUST BE YOU THEY ARE CONVERSING ABOUT ME MADAME YES YOU--OR RATHER YOUR ADVENTURE
HOWEVER SINCE IT MUST BE DONE SOME DAY OR ANOTHER STAY
YOU WILL FORGIVE MY FRIVOLITY AND MY COQUETRY
MADAME REMAINED IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE FIGURES AND OF AN ATTITUDE UNABLE TO UTTER A WORD
LET ME HOPE COMTE SAID THE KING THAT YOU HAVE COME TO ASK ME FOR SOMETHING I WILL NOT CONCEAL FROM YOUR MAJESTY REPLIED THE COMTE THAT I AM INDEED COME FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT IS WELL SAID THE KING JOYOUSLY
THE DYING MAN HAD BARELY TIME TO PRESS ARAMIS'S HAND WHEN HE FELL IN CONVULSIONS FROM HIS BED UPON THE FLOOR
WHEN MUSIC AND SUPPER PARTIES ARE HELD IN PRIVATE APARTMENTS
BUT TROUBLE IS STIRRING IN BOTH FRANCE AND ENGLAND
YOU ARE AWARE I SUPPOSE THAT DE GUICHE IS UP TO HIS VERY NECK IN DISGRACE ALAS
I WILL GO AND LISTEN
AND THEN SPEAKING ALOUD ADDED,--"WELL MY DEAR GOVERNOR SHALL WE NOW ARRANGE OUR LITTLE ACCOUNTS I AM AT YOUR ORDERS MY LORD
IS IT LIKELY THAT EVEN IN YOUR OWN OPINION YOU WOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LISTENED TO LA VALLIERE WRUNG HER HANDS AND HID HER FACE IN THEM AS IF TO HIDE HER BLUSHES
DE GUICHE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE KING'S CABINET THE WHOLE OF THE COMPANY HAVING DEPARTED
BUT THAT WAS NOTHING BUT NONSENSE
IN OTHER WORDS SAID MONTALAIS SHE IS INSUPPORTABLE
FROM THIS MOMENT INDEED HER ROYAL HIGHNESS BELONGS TO FRANCE AND WHEN SHE DEIGNS TO HONOR ME BY TOUCHING MY HAND IT IS THE HAND OF MONSIEUR THE BROTHER OF THE KING OF FRANCE SHE TOUCHES AND SAYING THIS HE PRESENTED HIS HAND TO MADAME HENRIETTA WITH SUCH MARKED DEFERENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH A NOBLENESS OF MIEN SO INTREPID THAT A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION ROSE FROM THE ENGLISH WHILST A GROAN OF DESPAIR ESCAPED FROM BUCKINGHAM'S LIPS
I AM READY TO GIVE IT
ARAMIS LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH A MINGLED FEELING OF COMPASSION AND SILENCE
BUT I BELIEVE MADAME TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS PERSON IN WHAT RESPECT SHE HAS PERCEIVED THAT MONSIEUR IS NOT VERY PASSIONATELY INCLINED TOWARDS WOMEN QUITE TRUE SAID THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE LAUGHING
MADAME ALMOST OUT OF HER SENSES WITH JOY AT THE FIRST BARS OF MUSIC WAS DANCING IN THE MOST UNRESTRAINED MANNER LEAVING THE DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN ALREADY BEGUN UNFINISHED
IF LA FONTAINE WERE HERE SAID FOUQUET SMILING WHAT AN ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO RECITE HIS FABLE OF THE FROG THAT WANTED TO MAKE ITSELF AS BIG AS THE OX COLBERT ARRIVED IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE BLAZING WITH LIGHT
THE HAIR-BRAINED FELLOW IS CAPABLE OF SETTING OFF POST-HASTE TO HIS OWN ESTATES
FOR YOU DO NOT THINK I SUPPOSE SAID THE QUEEN LAUGHING THAT I HAVE PUT THESE BRACELETS UP TO A LOTTERY FROM NECESSITY
THESE GENTLEMEN RETORTED BUCKINGHAM ARRIVED HERE SAFELY NOTWITHSTANDING THE WIND
BUT WHEN WE HAVE NO GUITARS WE HAVE VIOLINS AND FLUTES
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A FEW OTHERS I TRUST CERTAINLY SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT OBJECT D'ARTAGNAN HAD IN VIEW
BUT IN THE MEANTIME DO WHAT I ADVISE YOU
BUT PRAY REST AWHILE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO WALK MUCH LONGER AT THIS RATE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE PRINCES FOR IT WAS SHE
FOUQUET WAS READY IN PLACING CONFIDENCE IN PEOPLE AND FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS MAN HAD SERVED HIM FAITHFULLY
AND BY WAY OF A BEGINNING I WILL SET ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF AN EPIGRAM UPON ALL THREE OF THEM
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD
ANNE OF AUSTRIA FELT THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS NOW COMPLETE
WHAT SHALL I CONFESS WHAT MAKES YOU WEEP
A GLASS FOR YOURSELF AS YOU PLEASE AND ARAMIS AND THE GOVERNOR NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS THEY DRANK THEIR WINE
SHE HAD HARDLY FINISHED HER MORNING TOILETTE HER MAID BEING STILL IN THE NEXT ROOM
LA VALLIERE'S FEET BEGAN TO SLEEP ON THE DAMP GRASS
THAT A YOUNG MAID OF HONOR LIKE YOU SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO A BAD EXAMPLE IS CERTES A MISFORTUNE GREAT ENOUGH
BRAGELONNE BRAGELONNE MURMURED DE GUICHE
THE PRINCESS IT WILL HAVE BEEN SEEN BY THIS PECULIARLY FEMININE MANEUVER HAD ESCAPED EVERY REPROACH AND ADVANCED ON HER SIDE A FAR MORE SERIOUS ONE
BEWARE OF MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT MADAME
THE PRISONER HAD NOT STIRRED
AND BOOTED SPURRED AND WHIP IN HAND TOO THE MOST BEFITTING COSTUME FOR A MAN ABOUT TO SET OFF FOR LE HAVRE
COME I CAN OFFER YOU A ROOM IN MY OWN APARTMENTS WHICH I CAN ASSURE YOU NO FRANCISCAN WILL DEPRIVE YOU OF
AS THE CHEVALIER WAS ASCENDING THE SIDE STAIRCASE WHICH LED TO THE PRIVATE ENTRANCE HE SAW A WOMAN FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER MAKE HER APPEARANCE UNDER THE ARCADE WHICH LED FROM THE SMALL TO THE LARGE COURTYARD
CALL GRISART AND DESIRE THE VENETIAN MARINI TO COME SAID THE SICK MAN
YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD PEOPLE SAY SO MANY THINGS YES BUT THIS IS VERY SINGULAR HOW WELL YOU KNOW HOW TO EXCITE CURIOSITY MARGUERITE WELL I WAS AFRAID OF VEXING YOU NEVER
I SO PROUD REPLIED MADAME VANEL
WHERE IS SHE NOW AH MONTALAIS,--LAUGHTER-LOVING MONTALAIS CRIED LA VALLIERE
AH SHE SAID AND HOW LONG IS IT SINCE THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR SOME DAYS IT SEEMS
IN FACT THE KING'S AND QUEEN'S GRAND ASSEMBLIES WHILE THEIR MAJESTIES WERE SPEAKING AND WHILE EVERY ONE PRESENT SEEMED TO BE LISTENING IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE SOME OF THESE NOISELESS CONVERSATIONS TOOK PLACE IN WHICH ADULATION WAS NOT THE PREVAILING FEATURE
WHEN THE SERVANT HAD LEFT HE SAID EXCELLENT ARAMIS WHO HAD FOLLOWED EVERY MOVEMENT WITH HIS EYES NOTICED THAT HE STRETCHED HIMSELF UPON THE CUSHIONS WITH A SORT OF FEVERISH IMPATIENCE
AT OTHERS I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DRENCHED IN THE OSIERS BY THE EVENING DAMPS OR THE SPRAY FROM THE FOUNTAINS,--HALF-FAMISHED FATIGUED TO DEATH WITH THE VIEW OF A WALL ALWAYS BEFORE ME AND THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO SCALE IT PERHAPS
FOUQUET SAID THE KING
CAN A PASSION BE KINDLED IN THIS MANNER LIKE A TORCH IN A MOMENT
BUT DIANA HERSELF EVEN THE CHASTE DIANA CLOTHED IN HER LONG CHLAMYS WAS LESS BEAUTIFUL--LESS IMPENETRABLE THAN MADAME AS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL AS THAT GODDESS HERSELF
AND HE WOULD HAVE RUINED HIMSELF FOR AMBITION
IT HAD A SINGULARLY CURIOUS EFFECT ALMOST FAIRY-LIKE IN ITS APPEARANCE
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE ACTED INDISCREETLY AND WHILE HE COMPOSED HIS FACE AND CONTINUED TO SMILE CHEERFULLY ON THE GOVERNOR HE WAS CONSIDERING HOW BAISEMEAUX WHO WAS NOT AWARE OF HIS ADDRESS KNEW HOWEVER THAT VANNES WAS HIS RESIDENCE
MY POSITION IS VERY INSECURE AND SOME ACCIDENT WILL BE CERTAIN TO BEFALL ME IF I ATTEMPT UNAIDED TO REACH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
WHAT A STATE OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE
WAS THIS REALLY MALICIOUSNESS OF DISPOSITION OR SIMPLY WAYWARDNESS OF CHARACTER
MALICORNE TO M
IT IS YOURSELF WHY SO YOU KNOW THE PRINCESS'S CHARACTER,--SOMEWHAT GIDDY EASILY CAPTIVATED BY NOVELTY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLATTERY WHETHER IT COME FROM A BLIND PERSON OR A CHILD AND YET YOU ALLOW YOUR PASSION FOR HER TO EAT YOUR VERY LIFE AWAY
THE MILDNESS OF THE EVENING THE SEA BREEZES SO DEAR TO CONTEMPLATIVE MINDS SETTING IN FROM THE EAST AND BLOWING IN DELICIOUS GUSTS
DID YOU NOT PERCEIVE I DID INDEED SIRE
DON'T ASSUME SUCH SANCTIFIED AIRS
WITH A MOVEMENT AS RAPID AS THOUGHT SHE PLACED BOTH HER HANDS IN THOSE OF RAOUL AND THEN FLED WITHOUT ADDING A SYLLABLE
I MAY DEPEND ON IT THEN YES MONSEIGNEUR
LET US LEAVE POOR LA VALLIERE WHO HAD FAINTED IN THE ARMS OF HER TWO COMPANIONS AND RETURN TO THE PRECINCTS OF THE ROYAL OAK
ON THE CONTRARY INDEED IN MY THOUGHTS MONSIEUR EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT MY AFFAIRS CONCERN MYSELF ALONE MONSIEUR
WILL HE BE SENT AWAY TOO IF IT BE NECESSARY WHY NOT REPLIED THE KING SMILING
BUT MALICORNE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID HAD PERSONAL MATTERS OF HIS OWN TO OCCUPY HIS ATTENTION WHICH PREVENTED HIM FROM PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO OTHERS
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HOWEVER HASTENED TO SAY NAY BE COMFORTED GENTLEMEN HIS MAJESTY IS ALWAYS PALE WHEN HE IS ANGRY CHAPTER XXXIV
ON THE CONTRARY I REQUIRE YOU TO SPEAK
THAT IS DIFFERENT
WAIT WAIT YOU ARE NOT YET AT THE END THE KING TURNED PALE
THE BEST LODGING THE BASTILE AFFORDS HAS BEEN HIS
HAS YOUR GRACE WELL REFLECTED ON THEIR SERIOUSNESS THE DUKE HESITATED
AND SHE WAS SO FOR THE QUEENS NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR DIGNITY AND THE KING DESPITE THE RESPECT WHICH ETIQUETTE REQUIRED WERE ALL ECLIPSED BY HER
YOU WILL PERHAPS DENY THE EXISTENCE OF VIRTUE COME LOUISE TELL US THE TRUTH SAID AURE TAKING HER BY THE HAND
ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU OH
HOW CAN ONE LEARN IT VERY EASILY MONSIEUR
A GOOD POST IN THE FAMILY OF A PRINCE OF THE BLOOD WHEN IT IS GIVEN BY THE CREDIT AND ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A FRIEND LIKE THE COMTE DE GUICHE IS WORTH AT LEAST TWELVE THOUSAND LIVRES PER ANNUM
SHE FANCIED SHE COULD DETECT IN HER FRIEND'S EYES A BRIGHTNESS WHICH WAS NEITHER THAT OF HEALTH NOR OF PLEASURE
WAS IT FOR HER TO RESTRAIN OR RATHER COULD SHE RESTRAIN THE CHATTERING OF A FEW COUNTRY GIRLS
A LOOK FROM ME WILL REPAY HIM FOR THE SACRIFICES HE MAKES OR WILL INSPIRE HIM WITH THE VIRTUES WHICH HE WOULD NEVER THINK HE POSSESSED BUT LOUISE EXCLAIMED MONTALAIS YOU TELL US THIS AND DO NOT CARRY IT INTO PRACTICE WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE ADORED BY RAOUL DE BRAGELONNE WHO WORSHIPS YOU ON BOTH KNEES
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WAS AN AGREEABLE CHEERFUL VISITOR
IS NOT WRITING MORE DANGEROUS STILL THAN LANGUAGE NO MY LORD SAID ARAMIS FOR YOU WILL FIND WITHIN THIS ENVELOPE CHARACTERS WHICH YOU AND I ALONE CAN UNDERSTAND THE FRANCISCAN LOOKED AT ARAMIS WITH AN ASTONISHMENT WHICH MOMENTARILY INCREASED
I WILL GRANT YOUR REQUEST WITHOUT DELAY RAOUL THE COUNT APPROACHED THE WINDOW AND LEANING OUT CALLED TO GRIMAUD WHO SHOWED HIS HEAD FROM AN ARBOR COVERED WITH JASMINE WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED IN TRIMMING
THE GAYER YOU SEEM THE MORE CHARMING YOU APPEAR AND YOU WILL ECLIPSE ALL THE LADIES PRESENT AS MUCH BY YOUR BRILLIANCY AS BY YOUR RANK MARIA THERESA LEFT FULL OF DELIGHT
THINGS WENT ON IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE SEVENTH DAY A DAY OF WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN SUCH FULL DETAILS WITH ITS NIGHT ALSO IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS
SHE IS ALL KINDNESS AND WILL EXCUSE YOU
THESE TWO APPEARED TO HAVE ATTAINED THE CULMINATING POINT OF A DISCUSSION--HALF-BANTERING HALF-SERIOUS
DE GUICHE THEN QUESTIONED HIM MORE DIRECTLY UPON THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE SCENE OF THE MORNING AND UPON THE STILL MORE SERIOUS EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE SCENE AT DINNER
WITH AN EFFORT AND AN EXCLAMATION OF PAIN HE TORE OUT THE BLADE WHICH REMAINED IN HIS ARM AND TURNING TOWARDS DE WARDES SAID ARE YOU DEAD MARQUIS NO REPLIED DE WARDES IN A VOICE CHOKED BY THE BLOOD WHICH RUSHED FROM HIS LUNGS TO HIS THROAT BUT VERY NEAR IT WELL WHAT IS TO BE DONE
BAISEMEAUX DE MONTLEZUN
IT IS ON MADAME'S SIDE EXPLAIN YOURSELF I WILL
SINCE I HAVE DONE EVIL I OUGHT TO REPAIR THE EVIL I HAVE DONE
COME SAINT-AIGNAN YOUR MAJESTY IS AMBITIONS I PERCEIVE AND DOES NOT WISH TO ALLOW ANY CONQUEST TO ESCAPE YOU
AND IN THAT WAY THE RUMORS WILL CEASE WELL I WILL SEE
SOMETIMES I HAVE BEEN BURNT BY THE FIREWORKS WHICH HAVE SINGED TWO OF MY WIGS
IT WAS LONG PAST ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN SAINT-AIGNAN PERCEIVED DE GUICHE STANDING MOTIONLESS LEANING AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A TREE WITH HIS EYES FASTENED UPON THE LIGHTED WINDOW,--THE SLEEPIEST HOUR OF NIGHT-TIME WHICH PAINTERS CROWN WITH MYRTLES AND BUDDING POPPIES THE HOUR WHEN EYES ARE HEAVY HEARTS THROB AND HEADS FEEL DULL AND LANGUID--AN HOUR WHICH CASTS UPON THE DAY WHICH HAS PASSED AWAY A LOOK OF REGRET WHILE ADDRESSING A LOVING GREETING TO THE DAWNING LIGHT
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
ALAS
VANNES IS AN IMPORTANT DIOCESE
FIRE AND WATER CANNOT BE MORE OPPOSITE THAT WILL DO
YOUR REMARK SHOWS THAT YOU DID NOT HEAR WHAT I SAID HOW SO WHY I BEGAN BY TELLING YOU I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME YES
HE THEN PASSED ACROSS HIS SALLOW FACE A HAND WHICH SEEMED DRIED UP BY FEVER AND RUBBED HIS NERVOUS AND AGITATED FINGERS ACROSS HIS BEARD
BAISEMEAUX THAT IT CAN BE NOTHING MORE THAN A RESEMBLANCE OF YOUR OWN CREATION UPON MY HONOR IT IS NOT SO STAY CONTINUED ARAMIS
CONSEQUENTLY HE HARDLY TOOK TIME TO SALUTE THE PRINCESS AS HE DREW UP TO ALLOW HER TO PASS
RAOUL SAID LOUISE BLUSHING WE ARE ALONE
I WISH TO HAVE IT VOLUNTARILY AND IN NO OTHER WAY
THE SERVICES OF YOUR FAMILY HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY BROUGHT UNDER MY NOTICE
FOR MY OWN PART I RESOLVED TO TELL YOU THE STORY
BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR YOUR SCHOOLMASTER'S ROD DOES NOT KILL SO EASILY NO REPLIED RAOUL STERNLY BUT M
THE KING MADE HER LEAN BACK AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE TREE WHOSE VAST CIRCUMFERENCE PROTECTED BY THE THICKNESS OF THE FOLIAGE WAS AS DRY AS IF AT THAT MOMENT THE RAIN HAD NOT BEEN FALLING IN TORRENTS
WHEN I CANNOT SPEAK THE TRUTH I REMAIN SILENT YOU WILL NOT LONG REMAIN IN FAVOR SAID MONTALAIS
NAY A SONG HAS EVEN BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT OH
SHE PERCEIVED LOVE LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF LOUIS'S HEART AS A SKILLFUL DIVER SEES A PEARL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
FOR A LONG TIME PAST I HAVE LOVED YOU BUT WOULD NOT CONFESS IT
RETURN TO ENGLAND HE SAID
MADAME IS SUFFICIENTLY BEAUTIFUL AND OF HIGH ENOUGH RANK I SUPPOSE LA VALLIERE SHOOK HER HEAD SORROWFULLY SAYING WHEN ONE LOVES IT IS NEITHER BEAUTY NOR RANK;--WHEN ONE LOVES IT SHOULD BE THE HEART OR THE EYES ONLY OF HIM OR OF HER WHOM ONE LOVES MONTALAIS BEGAN TO LAUGH LOUDLY
THE HIGHEST NAMES IN THE KINGDOM YOU ARE VERY STRANGELY MISTAKEN MY DEAR COMTE
THEN QUITE OUT OF BREATH COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION AND TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS BROKE IN PIECES SOME BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS OF PORCELAIN AND THEN GOT INTO BED BOOTED AND SPURRED AS HE WAS CRYING OUT FOR SOME ONE TO COME TO HIM
AND AS HE DID NOT WRITE TO ME BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF BY SAYING TO ME I WILL AUTHORIZE YOU YET WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTING YOU YOU MUST FEEL THAT IT PLACES ME IN A VERY EMBARRASSING POSITION WHAT DO YOU AUTHORIZE ME TO DO THEN WHY TO LET YOUR ROOMS IF YOU FIND A GOOD TENANT FOR THEM I YES YOU NEVER WILL I DO SUCH A THING MONSIEUR
NEVER UNTIL NOW HAD SHE BESTOWED SUCH CLOSE ATTENTION UPON RICHES IN WHICH WOMEN TAKE SO MUCH PRIDE
HOW CAN YOU HAVE LEARNT IT
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER TASTE OF THIS VOLNAY NOT A TASTE MERELY A FULL GLASS
MANICAMP AND MONTALAIS DESCENDED A FEW ROUNDS OF THE LADDER MANICAMP INSISTING AND MONTALAIS LAUGHING AND OBJECTING
MANICAMP ASKED ME TO GET THE SITUATION OF MAID OF HONOR FOR MONTALAIS IN MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD AND A SITUATION FOR MALICORNE AS AN OFFICER IN MONSIEUR'S HOUSEHOLD
IS EVERYTHING PREPARED FOR MY DEPARTURE SHE INQUIRED OF ONE OF HER FEMALE ATTENDANTS WHO ENTERED
BUT WHAT IS STILL MORE EXTRAORDINARY IS THAT HE HAS NEVER TOLD ME SO MUCH AS HE HAS JUST TOLD YOU PERHAPS THE REASON MAY BE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED HIM SAID ARAMIS
IS YOUR REMARK THEN A CONFESSION WHY DO YOU ASK IN ORDER TO KNOW WHETHER I AM TO KEEP YOUR WORDS SECRET MY REMARKS ARE PART OF MY CONFESSION
ANNE OF AUSTRIA COULD NOT RESIST LAUGHING AND WAS LAUGHING STILL WHEN THE KING ENTERED
SHORT ACCOUNTS MAKE LONG FRIENDS
AND HIS CLOTH SHOES WITH GREAT KNOTS OF RIBBON THAT IT WAS HE WHO WAS PAYING FOR ALL THOSE BURSTS OF LAUGHTER ALL THOSE STOLEN KISSES ALL THOSE WHISPERINGS ALL THOSE LITTLE KEEPSAKES AND ALL THOSE BUBBLE PROJECTS WHICH FORMED A CHAIN OF FORTY-FIVE LEAGUES IN LENGTH FROM THE PALAIS OF BLOIS TO THE PALAIS ROYAL
NOW AMONG ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN WHOM YOU SAW WHICH DO YOU PREFER YES SAID MONTALAIS IS IT M
BRAGELONNE NEXT SOUGHT OUT DE GUICHE BUT THE COUNT WAS OCCUPIED IN A LONG CONFERENCE WITH HIS TAILORS AND WITH MANICAMP WHICH CONSUMED HIS WHOLE TIME
I WILL BE YOUR ARIADNE
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE WITH ME IS NOT OF THAT CHARACTER
RELY UPON ME DUKE AS I RELY UPON YOU YOU DO NOT EXPLAIN YOURSELF MADAME
SIRE SAID FOUQUET REMARKING THE GRACIOUS MANNER IN WHICH LOUIS WAS ABOUT TO RECEIVE HIM YOUR MAJESTY HAS OVERWHELMED ME WITH KINDNESS DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
I WILL DRAW HIM ASIDE IN THE GALLERY
THEY THEN CONVERSED OF THE COURT WITHOUT ALLUDING TO MADAME
LIKE A CHILD HE WAS CAPTIVATED BY HER RADIANT BEAUTY WHICH HER WIT MADE STILL MORE DAZZLING
BUT OUR HORSES ARE READY I SEE
AND AS HE ENTERED GLANCED ROUND THE ROOM AND PERCEIVING THE COUNT HE WENT AND PLACED HIMSELF BY HIS SIDE
IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
I AM ENCAMPED ON THE DANUBE
BAH SAID DE WARDES
AND IF WE WERE TO SHOW MADAME ANY ATTENTION SAID MANICAMP FRANKLY SPEAKING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD PLEASE MONSIEUR PRECISELY
THIS WAS THE MOMENT TO PRESENT DE GUICHE AND THE PRINCE DREW ASIDE AND LET DE GUICHE PASS HIM WHO WITH A TOLERABLY WELL-ASSUMED AWKWARDNESS OF MANNER APPROACHED MADAME AND MADE HIS REVERENCE TO HER
WHY THEN WELL FINISH WHY THEN I SAY MONSEIGNEUR ONE POSSIBLY MAY GET JEALOUS
RAOUL WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
YOU KNOW MY MOTTO
NOR COULD SHE ANY MORE THAN ANOTHER READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THAT TERRIBLE AND FATAL BOOK OF THE FUTURE WHICH RECORDS IN ITS MOST SECRET PAGES THE MOST SERIOUS EVENTS
I TRUST I AM THE ONLY ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WHO HAS GUESSED IT ARE YOU AWARE MONSIEUR SAID BUCKINGHAM TREMBLING WITH MINGLED FEELINGS OF ANGER AND UNEASINESS ARE YOU AWARE THAT YOU ARE HOLDING LANGUAGE TOWARDS ME WHICH REQUIRES TO BE CHECKED WEIGH YOUR WORDS WELL MY LORD SAID RAOUL HAUGHTILY
A HORSE WHICH HOLDS ITS HEAD HIGH IT IS SAID NEVER TIRES HIS RIDER'S HAND
AND I WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO ECONOMIZE FROM COMPULSION IN ORDER TO GET POSSESSION OF IT INDEED IT IS SINGULAR YOU SHOULD BE ASTONISHED AT THAT SINCE YOU LEAVE ME WITHOUT ANY MONEY AT ALL EVENTS HERE YOU ARE AND THAT IS THE PRINCIPAL THING BY THE MOST HORRIBLE ROADS WHERE ARE YOU LODGING LODGING YES I AM NOT LODGING ANYWHERE DE GUICHE BEGAN TO LAUGH
BUT I THINK I HEAR VOICES IN THE ANTE-ROOMS--NO DOUBT A COURIER HAS JUST ARRIVED
BESIDES ADMITTING THAT I PAY THIS TIME HOW CAN I DO SO ON ANOTHER OCCASION
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR LADIES TO DISEMBARK JUST NOW THE SEA IS TOO ROUGH
OCCASIONALLY DURING THE JOURNEY HE CONVERSED WITH THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND RESPECTING THE POWER OF FASCINATION WHICH MADAME POSSESSED AND THE MOTHER WHOM SO MANY MISFORTUNES AND DECEPTIONS HAD TAUGHT EXPERIENCE REPLIED
IT IS TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION I AM AWARE THAT I OWE MY ADMISSION AMONG THE NUMBER OF MADAME'S MAIDS OF HONOR INDEED
DRESSED IN BLACK THE LACE IN FRONT OF HIS CHEST MUCH DISARRANGED BY HIS FEVERISHLY RESTLESS HAND THE LOOKS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT FULL OF DREAMY REFLECTION WERE FIXED UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE ROOM WHICH HE HAD SO FREQUENTLY APPROACHED IN SEARCH OF EXPECTED HAPPINESS
THAT IS THE REASON I COULD NOT ASK HIM FOR A TICKET
DE GUICHE IS LODGING NOTHING COULD BE MORE CLEARLY INDICATED SAID MANICAMP
THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF AGAIN WENT TO THE STABLES FOUND THE GROOM ONCE MORE ASKED HIM FOR A CARRIAGE OR A HORSE AND UPON HIS REPLY THAT THERE WAS NEITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER MONSIEUR SNATCHED A LONG WHIP FROM THE HAND OF A STABLE-BOY AND BEGAN TO PURSUE THE POOR DEVIL OF A GROOM ALL ROUND THE SERVANTS COURTYARD WHIPPING HIM THE WHILE IN SPITE OF HIS CRIES AND EXCUSES
MONSIEUR WAS AFRAID TO BE DETECTED LISTENING AT THE DOOR AND HE THEREFORE MADE UP HIS MIND TO COUGH
OH SUGAR-PLUMS I SPEAK FOR MYSELF REPLIED LA VALLIERE
HE WAS DRESSED IN A TUNIC OF FLOWERS WHICH SET OFF HIS GRACEFUL AND WELL-FORMED FIGURE TO ADVANTAGE
DO YOU LOVE ANY ONE I EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE
RENOUNCE EVERYTHING EVEN THE BROTHERLY FEELING WHICH UNITES US IT IS ALMOST CRUEL WHAT YOU SAY D'ARTAGNAN PRESSED ATHOS'S HAND WARMLY
MON DIEU NO
BESIDES YOU DO NOT KNOW THE IDEA THAT HAS STRUCK ME I DO NOT EVEN SUSPECT IT WELL THEN
HE LOOKED PALE AND SEEMED BOWED DOWN BY THE WEIGHT OF SOME BITTER REFLECTION
AND AS IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS OWN HEART HE HAD JUST DECISIVELY MADE UP HIS MIND DE GUICHE AROSE AND OBSERVING BRAGELONNE'S HESITATION HE TURNED TOWARDS HIM A GLANCE FULL OF RESIGNATION AND GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THE KING IN QUESTION WERE TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON TO LOUIS XIV ANOTHER PERSON YES WHO IS INDEBTED FOR EVERYTHING TO YOU IMPOSSIBLE HIS VERY THRONE EVEN YOU ARE MAD D'HERBLAY
BUT WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME BECAUSE I FELT THAT I WAS OF NO FURTHER USE TO YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF YOUR HIGHNESS HAS PEOPLE ABOUT YOU WHO ARE FAR MORE AMUSING THAT I CAN EVER BE
THE HAPPY PAIR HAND IN HAND IMPERCEPTIBLY PRESSING EACH OTHER'S FINGERS DRANK IN DEEP DRAUGHTS THE SWEET BEVERAGE OF ADULATION BY WHICH THE ATTRACTIONS OF YOUTH BEAUTY POWER AND LOVE ARE ENHANCED
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE KING HAD BEEN MORE JEALOUS REPLIED THE CHEVALIER SPITEFULLY
THIS GENTLEMAN HAS COME TO TAKE YOUR MEASURE AND HERE ARE SOME PRESERVES FOR YOUR DESSERT OH MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN KEEP ME IN SOLITUDE FOR A YEAR LET ME HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER FOR A YEAR BUT TELL ME THAT AT THE END OF A YEAR I SHALL LEAVE THIS PLACE TELL ME THAT AT THE END OF A YEAR I SHALL SEE MY MOTHER AGAIN BUT I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS VERY POOR AND THAT YOU WERE VERY BADLY LODGED WHEN YOU WERE LIVING WITH HER WHILE HERE--UPON MY WORD IF SHE WERE POOR MONSIEUR THE GREATER REASON TO RESTORE HER ONLY MEANS OF SUPPORT TO HER
AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE CHEVALIER WITH AN INDIFFERENCE AMOUNTING TO CONTEMPT
DO NOT TELL ANY ONE THE QUEEN LEAST OF ALL HE SAID MYSTERIOUSLY WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE KING WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT HIM INQUIRED MADAME
THE YOUNG FELLOW HAS BY NO MEANS BEEN UNHAPPY THERE
PROPERLY TO OBEY THOSE WHOM WE RESPECT SAID RAOUL IT IS NECESSARY TO OBEY QUICKLY
I MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HEAVEN FORGIVE ME IF THAT IS NOT MONSIEUR BAISEMEAUX'S VOICE IT IS MONSIEUR WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE COURTYARD MY DEAR BAISEMEAUX I AM WAITING YOUR ORDERS MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WRETCH THAT I AM THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
I HAVE JUST SAID THAT I DESIRE TO SECURE M
MONSIEUR FOUQUET HE SAID WHEN HE HAD QUITE SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE ALONE WE MUST GET BACK AT ANY COST THAT LETTER YOU WROTE TO LA VALLIERE THAT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH SAID FOUQUET IF MY SERVANT HAS NOT GIVEN IT TO HER IN ANY CASE IT MUST BE HAD DO YOU UNDERSTAND YES
WE WILL THEN ENTER INTO SOME DETAILS CONCERNING MESSIEURS MALICORNE AND MANICAMP
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT INQUIRED FOUQUET OF ARAMIS
IT WAS PRECISELY AT THIS HOUR THAT SAINT-AIGNAN BADLY ADVISED,--SELFISHNESS ALWAYS COUNSELS BADLY,--CAME AND STRUCK HIM ON THE SHOULDER AT THE VERY MOMENT HE WAS MURMURING A WORD OR RATHER A NAME
DE BRAGELONNE WERE OFFENDED I COULD NOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO ESPOUSE HIS QUARREL SINCE HE IS HIMSELF HERE
D'HERBLAY IS UNEQUALLED IN SUCH KIND OF MISSIONS M
HE THEN DREW UP CLOSE TO THE COUNT DISMOUNTED AND THREW THE BRIDLE TO A GROOM STANDING BY
TO SPEAK IN THAT MANNER FROM ANY PARTICULAR PLACE WITHOUT BENDING DOWN OR TURNING ROUND OR LOOKING AT THE PERSON WITH WHOM ONE MAY BE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION IS A TALENT THAT CANNOT BE IMMEDIATELY ACQUIRED BY NEWCOMERS
WHY THE DEUCE ARE YOUNG MEN OF FAMILY TAUGHT LATIN
THE QUEEN-MOTHER NEXT DIRECTED THE SMALL TABLE TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD ON WHICH THE LOTTERY-TICKETS WERE PLACED TWO HUNDRED IN NUMBER AND BEGGED MADAME DE MOTTEVILLE TO READ THE LIST OF THE NAMES
THE KING RETURNED TO HIS APARTMENTS WITH HURRIED STEPS
THAT SINCE MY FATHER HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF LIFE HEAVEN COULD WELL SMITE MY PRIDE
BUT I FEEL MOST FOR THE SMALL TRADESMEN AND BAILIFFS CLERKS WHO ARE RATED AT THREE FRANCS
ONLY IN HER DEEP REFLECTION FOR MADAME SEEMED TO BE BURIED IN THOUGHT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO EXTINGUISH THE LIGHT
LADIES SOON WEARY WITHOUT MUSIC THE DEUCE!--AND THE MEN WHAT MEN MONSEIGNEUR M
HE TOOK CARE NOT TO SPEAK OF IT TO YOU HIMSELF SINCE HE RECOMMENDED EVERY ONE NOT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID MADAME GROWING ANGRY
THE KING HAS WON REPEATED THE QUEEN DELIGHTEDLY
THE YOUNG D'ARTAGNAN ARRIVES IN PARIS AT THE TENDER AGE OF 18 AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY OFFENDS THREE MUSKETEERS PORTHOS ARAMIS AND ATHOS
MY CLOTHES WERE MADE AT PARIS THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT
FOUQUET WITHOUT HIS POSSIBLY LEARNING FROM WHOM THE GIFT HAD COME
CAN I PUT YOUR MAJESTY IN THE WAY INQUIRED THE COMTE DE SAINT-AIGNAN
MALICORNE BUT THE POOR FELLOW WHOM I LAUGH AT KNOWS PRECISELY WHEN HE WILL BE PERMITTED TO PRESS HIS LIPS UPON MY HAND
HE BECKONED HIS MASTER MYSTERIOUSLY TOWARDS THE SERVANTS STAIRCASE AND SHOWED HIM INTO A SMALL ROOM WITH A WINDOW LOOKING OUT UPON THE GARDEN
MONSIEUR WAS NOW IN ONE OF THOSE MOODS BUT HE DREADED AS MUCH AS HE LIKED THE CHEVALIER AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH NURSING HIS ANGER WITHOUT BETRAYING IT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT EVERY ONE TRIED TO FORGET AND TO MAKE OTHERS FORGET THE BITTER DISCUSSIONS OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING
ARE YOU SURE YES SIRE
I REGRET TO HAVE TO CONFIDE SUCH MATTERS TO YOUR MAJESTY BUT I FEEL MYSELF TOO UNHAPPY AT YOUR MAJESTY'S COURT
I BELIEVE I BEGIN TO DESIRE SOMETHING AND WHAT DO YOU DESIRE MONSIEUR DEMON
HIS NAME ALONE IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH
IN THE GOOD TIMES PAST WHEN HER YOUTHFUL MIND NURSED PROJECTS THAT WERE ULTIMATELY INVARIABLY SUCCESSFUL SHE HAD BY HER SIDE TO STIMULATE HER AMBITION AND HER LOVE A FRIEND OF HER OWN SEX MORE EAGER MORE AMBITIOUS THAN HERSELF,--A FRIEND WHO HAD LOVED HER A RARE CIRCUMSTANCE AT COURTS AND WHOM SOME PETTY CONSIDERATIONS HAD REMOVED FROM HER FOREVER
D'ARTAGNAN IS NOT ONE TO LEAVE UNSETTLED ANY ENMITY HE MAY HAVE TO ARRANGE WITHOUT COMPLETELY CLEARING HIS ACCOUNT
DID I SAY
LIGHT HEARTS ARE THUS CONSTITUTED
BUT SHE AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO ENGLAND AND I AM IGNORANT WHAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED THERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIMPLY THAT THERE ARE SOME HEADS NATURALLY GIDDY WHICH ARE EASILY TURNED BY PROSPERITY THAT IS THE VERY WORD MADAME
DISCONTINUE I BEG WHENEVER I AM PRESENT THIS STYLE I COMPLAIN OF AND THE TONE ALSO
I HAVE RISEN SO HIGH
IT REMAINS FOR US TO INFORM OUR READERS WHO WAS THE TRAVELER IN THE CLOAK--THE PRINCIPAL TENANT OF THE DOUBLE APARTMENT OF WHICH MALICORNE HAD ONLY OCCUPIED A PORTION--AND THE FRANCISCAN QUITE AS MYSTERIOUS A PERSONAGE WHOSE ARRIVAL TOGETHER WITH THAT OF THE STRANGER UNFORTUNATELY UPSET THE TWO FRIENDS PLANS
NONE--ABSOLUTELY NONE THEN I CAN REASSURE MY BROTHER IN THAT RESPECT NOTHING WILL SATISFY HIM SIRE
SHE WAS SEEN
DE VANNES AGAIN ON ANOTHER OCCASION I BEG YOU TO DO SO
YOU ARE MARRIED
AS TO THE GOOD MAN MALICORNE--WE SPEAK OF THE SYNDIC OF ORLEANS--HE DID NOT SEE MORE CLEARLY INTO THE PRESENT THAN OTHERS DID INTO THE FUTURE
AS FOR THAT YOU WILL NOT FIND HIM AGAIN SAID ARAMIS AND IF HE WERE OF ANY GREAT VALUE TO YOU YOU MUST GIVE HIM UP FOR LOST AT ALL EVENTS HE IS SOMEWHERE OR ANOTHER IN THE WORLD SAID FOUQUET
DECIDEDLY I DO
LOOK AT THE PROUD ATHENAIS AS SHE IS CALLED
HE EXPERIENCED A LITTLE OF THE ANNOYANCE FELT BY A PERSON COMING FROM THE PROVINCES TO PARIS DRESSED OUT IN THE VERY BEST CLOTHES WHICH HIS WARDROBE CAN FURNISH ONLY TO FIND THAT THE FASHIONABLY DRESSED MAN THERE LOOKS AT HIM EITHER TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH
THERE WAS NOT AN INSTANT TO LOSE
I AM MY OWN MASTER
SEE HOW HE IS SURROUNDED PRAISED CONGRATULATED
NAMELY THAT THE ACUTE PAIN FROM WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING HAD ITS SEAT IN HIS HEART
RENOUNCE EVERYTHING WITHOUT FEAR
THE BIRDS SANG LESS INSPIRINGLY THAN USUAL UPON THE BOUGHS WHICH REMAINED MOTIONLESS AS THE LIMBS OF CORPSES
FOUQUET FOR MY ADDRESS WELL MONSIEUR SAID BAISEMEAUX COMPLETELY AT BAY IF I HAVE ACTED INDISCREETLY I BEG YOUR PARDON MOST SINCERELY NONSENSE OBSERVED ARAMIS CALMLY
A FEW LEAGUES FROM BELL-ISLE IS IT NOT YES SIRE REPLIED ARAMIS
ON WHAT GROUNDS AM I TO PAY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS FOR THAT MAN ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPOINTMENT WHICH HE OR RATHER WE PURCHASED FROM LOUVIERE AND TREMBLAY I HAVE A VERY VAGUE RECOLLECTION OF THE MATTER THAT IS LIKELY ENOUGH FOR YOU HAVE SO MANY AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
THEREFORE I WHO VIEW THE MATTER IN A PROSAIC LIGHT THAT IS TO SAY IN THE LIGHT OF REALITY I SAY
BELLE-ISLE IS FORTIFIED ADMIRABLY FORTIFIED
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER LOVED ME SO MUCH AS AT THIS MOMENT
A VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG FELLOW ALWAYS POOR ALWAYS NEEDY ALTHOUGH HE DIPPED HIS HAND FREELY INTO THE PURSE OF M
MALICORNE FORGIVE ME SAID RAOUL ARRESTING THE GIDDY GIRL AND GIVING TO HIS VOICE AN INTONATION THE GRAVITY OF WHICH CONTRASTED WITH THAT OF MONTALAIS
WAS KNOWN TO ALL
RESIGNING HIMSELF TO THE POST OF A GOOD WATCH-DOG WHO PATIENTLY WAITS AND WATCHES WITHOUT EVER GETTING IN HIS MASTER'S WAY
DE MANICAMP I AM MONSIEUR
AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THAT UGLY WRINKLE YOU TRY TO CULTIVATE ON YOUR FOREHEAD YOU WOULD HARDLY LOOK FIFTY YEARS OLD AND YOU ARE SIXTY IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN ALL QUITE TRUE OF COURSE I KNEW IT WAS TRUE AS TRUE AS THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS PROFIT YOU MAKE AT WHICH REMARK BAISEMEAUX STAMPED ON THE GROUND
SHADOWS SEEMED TO DANCE BEFORE HIS EYES
YOU HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF M
YOU REMIND ME THAT I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT
IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN TOO THAT THE KING WAS TRYING ON HIS COSTUME AND THAT THE BALLET WOULD BE DANCED IN THE EVENING
THEY SEEM TO BE AMUSING THEMSELVES THERE SAID THE KING
IN WHICH D'ARTAGNAN FINISHES BY AT LENGTH PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS CAPTAIN'S COMMISSION
NOW THEN BE OFF WELL AS I CANNOT BE BACK BEFORE TO-MORROW WE HAVE TIME TIME FOR WHAT TIME TO PLAY WHAT DO YOU WISH TO PLAY WITH YOUR TWENTY PISTOLES PARDIEU NO
ON THE FIRST DAY I DARED NOT LOOK AT HER
HE IS ON A MISSION WHICH RENDERS HIS PERSON INVIOLABLE
YOU CAN NOW IMAGINE THAT I MAY WELL HAVE WRINKLES ON MY FOREHEAD CAN YOU NOT YES INDEED AND YOU CAN IMAGINE TOO THAT NOTWITHSTANDING I MAY BE AS ROUND AS A CHEESE WITH A COMPLEXION LIKE AN APPLE AND MY EYES LIKE COALS ON FIRE I MAY ALMOST BE AFRAID THAT I SHALL NOT HAVE A CHEESE OR AN APPLE LEFT ME TO EAT AND THAT MY EYES WILL BE LEFT ME ONLY TO WEEP WITH IT IS REALLY A VERY GRIEVOUS AFFAIR I HAVE COME TO YOU M
AT A DISTANCE CERTAINLY
AND IT WILL HARDLY BE BELIEVED THAT BY THAT MEANS THERE WAS LESS TALKING AMONG THE SOCIETY MADAME ASSEMBLED TOGETHER THAN ELSEWHERE
THEN AS IF HE HAD ONLY COME FROM FONTAINEBLEAU HE QUICKLY TRAVERSED THE LOUVRE TO REJOIN BRAGELONNE
IT WOULD THEREFORE BE AN EXCESS OF KINDNESS ON MY PART YOU WILL ADMIT SINCE I AM PAYING MY ATTENTIONS TO HER TO OPEN THE DOOR OF HER ROOM TO YOU BUT WHO TOLD YOU IT WAS ON HER ACCOUNT I ASKED YOU FOR THE KEY FOR WHOM THEN SHE DOES NOT LODGE THERE ALONE I SUPPOSE NO CERTAINLY
WELL MY LORD HE SAID STILL STANDING UP OF ALL MEN OF THEIR WORD YOU STILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MOST PUNCTUAL IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS DEAR M
I LIKE THE AMUSEMENTS SOMEWHAT SERIOUS IN THEIR NATURE WHICH ARE NOT THE AMUSEMENTS OF MY OWN COUNTRY AND WHICH ARE MET WITH IN FRANCE ANNE OF AUSTRIA SMILED SHREWDLY
FOR IT WAS I WHO HAD THE SETTING OF THEM
WE SHALL HAVE A MOST ENJOYABLE JOURNEY
HER RESOLUTION WAS TAKEN
SHE WITH A SMILE THAT NO PAINTER COULD EVER SUCCEED IN DEPICTING AND WHICH A POET MIGHT ONLY IMAGINE GAVE HIM BOTH HER HANDS IN WHICH HE HID HIS BURNING FACE
THE YOUNG GIRL--WE KNOW HER FOR WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN HER AT THAT VERY SAME WINDOW BY THE LIGHT OF THAT SAME SUN--THE YOUNG GIRL PRESENTED A SINGULAR MIXTURE OF SHYNESS AND REFLECTION
HE IN HIS IMPATIENCE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE PRINCESS IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
WE SHALL NEVER FIND A MORE FAVORABLE ONE THAN THIS BUT I CANNOT THIS EVENING NOR AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WHY NOT BECAUSE A THOUSAND THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO-NIGHT WELL THEN MY AFFAIR WILL MAKE A THOUSAND AND ONE NO NO
THE OFFENSE WAS DIRECTED AGAINST MYSELF AND THE PERMISSION ONCE OBTAINED FROM HIS MAJESTY TO REVENGE IT IS MY AFFAIR TELL ME HIS NAME MONSIEUR I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO EXPOSE YOURSELF DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A DON DIEGO
THE QUEEN-MOTHER SMILED PLEASANTLY AT HIM SAYING WHAT DO YOU WANT PHILIP I?--NOTHING STAMMERED MONSIEUR
IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT AFTER HAVING BEEN ADORED BY BUCKINGHAM BY DE GUICHE WHO WAS SUPERIOR TO BUCKINGHAM EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY FROM THAT NEGATIVE MERIT SO MUCH APPRECIATED BY WOMEN THAT IS TO SAY NOVELTY--IT WAS NOT SURPRISING WE SAY THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD RAISE HER AMBITION TO BEING ADMIRED BY THE KING WHO NOT ONLY WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE KINGDOM BUT WAS ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST AND CLEVEREST MEN IN EUROPE
THEY PLAYED WROTE VERSES OR SELECTED MOTTOES OR EMBLEMATICAL DEVICES
IT IS MONSIEUR DE GUICHE WHISPERED MONTALAIS IN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE'S EAR
BUT INQUIRED THE JESUIT I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO LISTEN TO A CONFESSION
GRISART MURMURED THE MONK SEND FOR M
MADAME AFTER THE GREAT SCENE OF THE DRYADS AND NAIADS WAS SULKING BY HERSELF
AS FOR THAT MONSEIGNEUR OBJECTED DE GUICHE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO OBJECT WHAT AGAIN
BUT OBSERVE THAT IT FORMS AN EMINENCE TOLERABLY HIGH AND THAT THE TIDE RISES UP ON EVERY SIDE LEAVING THE TOP FREE
DE GUICHE AND ENDEAVOR TO GET HIM TO MAKE ADVANCES TO MONSIEUR
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER BOAT FILLED WITH OFFICERS COURTIERS AND ZEALOUS FRIENDS
THAT HIS MALICORNE'S POCKET CERTAINLY WAS DEEP AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A PLEASURE IN DRAWING ON IT IN TIMES OF PLENTY BUT THAT UNHAPPILY ABUSE HAD PRODUCED BARRENNESS
AND WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME HE SURELY CAN DO FOR YOU MALICORNE HAD HEARD HIS NAME PRONOUNCED TWICE
AND AFTER HAVING LAID IN A DUE PROVISION OF MELANCHOLY ANOTHER NOCTURNAL MALADY HE RETIRED TO REST THINKING WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN LOVE AFFAIR THAT PERHAPS FOUR OR EVEN A LARGER NUMBER OF EYES QUITE AS ARDENT AS THOSE OF DE GUICHE AND BUCKINGHAM WERE COVETING HIS OWN IDOL IN THE CHATEAU AT BLOIS
WHO CAN TELL IF THAT MIND WHEN THE TOUCHSTONE IS APPLIED TO IT WILL NOT BE FOUND OF A MEAN AND VULGAR CHARACTER
DURING THIS TIME THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WHO HAD RETURNED TO HIS OWN ROOM READ DE WARDES'S LATTER WITH SURPRISE FOR IT INFORMED HIM BY THE HAND OF HIS VALET OF THE SWORD-THRUST RECEIVED AT CALAIS AND OF ALL THE DETAILS OF THE ADVENTURE AND INVITED HIM TO INFORM DE GUICHE AND MONSIEUR WHATEVER THERE MIGHT BE IN THE AFFAIR LIKELY TO BE MOST DISAGREEABLE TO BOTH OF THEM
THE KING ROSE WITHOUT REMARKING THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHICH NO ONE MOREOVER TOOK ANY NOTICE AND CONTRARY TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM FOR GENERALLY HE REMAINED LATE IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND RETIRED TO HIS OWN SIDE OF THE PALACE
NORMANDY WITH ITS VAST VARIETY OF VEGETATION ITS BLUE SKIES AND SILVER RIVERS DISPLAYED ITSELF IN ALL THE LOVELINESS OF A PARADISE TO THE NEW SISTER OF THE KING
FAREWELL
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT IT IS CLEAR THAT YOUR DESTRUCTION IS THE OBJECT IN VIEW THAT IS YOUR OPINION STILL
THE WOMAN WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
WHAT IS TO BE DONE THEN WITH REGARD TO THIS GIRL WHENEVER YOU HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO ANY LADY MONSIEUR FOUQUET WHAT COURSE HAVE YOU GENERALLY PURSUED I HAVE WRITTEN TO HER PROTESTING MY DEVOTION TO HER
YOU KNOW THIS BETROTHED THEN ASSUREDLY
BUT FROM THE VERY MOMENT SHE STEPPED ON FRENCH GROUND AND NOW THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED HER IN THE NAME OF THE PRINCE I WARN YOU THAT AT THE FIRST MARK OF DISRESPECT WHICH YOU IN YOUR INSANE ATTACHMENT EXHIBIT TOWARDS THE ROYAL HOUSE OF FRANCE I SHALL HAVE ONE OF TWO COURSES TO FOLLOW;--EITHER I DECLARE IN THE PRESENCE OF EVERY ONE THE MADNESS WITH WHICH YOU ARE NOW AFFECTED AND I GET YOU IGNOMINIOUSLY ORDERED BACK TO ENGLAND
LOVE SAID MANICAMP
FOR ALL M
THE OLD MISER GAVE ME NO MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND AND THE EXPENSES OF THE POST AMOUNTED TO SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
BUT I DO NOT THINK ANY DANGER IS TO BE APPREHENDED FROM BUCKINGHAM NO
FOUQUET WHO HAD CALLED TO REQUEST PERMISSION TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO HER
NEITHER OF THEM COULD UTTER A SYLLABLE
COME HERE AND TELL ME THE TRUTH YOU KNOW MY LORD IT IS ONE OF MY DEFECTS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE DE GUICHE HOW THAT WICKED CHEVALIER HAS ANNOYED ME THE CHEVALIER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
HIS VISIT TO MONSIEUR AND MADAME TO THE YOUNG QUEEN AND TO THE QUEEN-DOWAGER HAD BEEN PAID COLLECTIVELY--A PRECAUTION ON THE PART OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER WHICH SAVED HIM THE DISTRESS OF ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH MONSIEUR AND ALSO THE DANGER OF SEEING MADAME AGAIN
MANICAMP BEGAN TO COUNT OUT THE PISTOLES
THE MEDIATOR
TO-MORROW MONSEIGNEUR
WHENEVER A KING TAKES NOTICE OF US CONTINUED MONTALAIS HE LETS US SEE IT EASILY ENOUGH AND IF WE HAPPEN TO BE THE OBJECT HE COVETS HE KNOWS VERY WELL HOW TO GAIN HIS OBJECT
YOU DE WARDES WILL ACCOMPANY ME TO THE LOUVRE AND YOU RAOUL WILL REMAIN HERE MASTER OF THE HOUSE
LAME REPEATED THE PRINCE AND MADAME TO HAVE HER CONSTANTLY BEFORE HER EYES
I PASS OVER SAID MANICAMP
I SHALL INDEED BE UNHAPPY IF I DO NOT OVERCOME IT THAT ONE THING IN QUESTION SIRE IS NOT IN YOUR POWER NOT EVEN IN THE POWER OF HEAVEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS THE PAST I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MADAME SAID THE KING PRECISELY BECAUSE HE HAD UNDERSTOOD HER BUT TOO WELL
HE BOWED THEN ALSO MUCH MORE FROM BENEVOLENCE AND COMPASSION THAN FROM RESPECT
I WENT UP-STAIRS AGAIN
DURING THIS INTERVAL HIS LIPS QUIVERED HIS FINGERS WORKED CONVULSIVELY AND HIS EYES WANDERED AS THOUGH IN DELIRIUM
YOU WILL PERHAPS UNDERSTAND ME
THEN SPEAKING ALOUD HE SAID DO YOU YOURSELF CHOOSE FOR ME THE ONE WHO IS TO CURE OUR JEALOUS FRIEND
HOW SO THE TWENTY I HAVE WON IN WHAT WAY BY LAYING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE LETTER FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE IN EIGHT HOURS AH
SHE THEN HANDED THE JEWELS TO THOSE LADIES WHO WERE NEAR HER PRONOUNCING THIS SINGLE WORD BUT WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WAS WORTH A LONG PHRASE MAGNIFICENT THE LADIES WHO HAD RECEIVED THE BRACELETS FROM MADAME'S HANDS LOOKED AT THEM AS LONG AS THEY CHOSE TO EXAMINE THEM AND THEN MADE THEM CIRCULATE BY PASSING THEM ON TOWARDS THE RIGHT
YES SHE MURMURED
BE EASY ON THAT SCORE MONSIEUR
NOW REALLY MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION FOR THE KING IS VERY PALE THE FACT WAS THE KING WAS VISIBLY LOSING COLOR
D'HERBLAY
D'HERBLAY
THE DRESS ALONE AMOUNTED TO THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
SAINT-AIGNAN THOUGHT IT WAS HIS DUTY AGAIN TO RETIRE FOR HE OBSERVED THE PASSIONATE DEVOTION WHICH WAS DISPLAYED IN THE KING'S GAZE
A COLD PERSPIRATION BEDEWED THE COMTE'S FACE HIS HANDS CONVULSIVELY OPENED AND HIS HAT WHICH HE HELD BETWEEN HIS TREMBLING FINGERS FELL TO THE GROUND
FOR I HAVE FURNISHED BOTH FIRST OF ALL THE NEW ONE THE COVERS THE GOBLETS AND THE DISHES WITH THEIR COVERS THE EAU-EPERGNE THE ICE-PAILS THE DISHES FOR THE PRESERVES AND THE TEA AND COFFEE URNS COST YOUR LADYSHIP SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS NO MORE YOUR LADYSHIP THOUGHT THE ACCOUNT VERY HIGH YES YES
DE BRAGELONNE THAT IS PLAIN ENOUGH IS IT NOT AT THIS QUESTION WHICH FELL LIKE THE FIRST BOMBSHELL OF A BESIEGING ARMY INTO A DOOMED TOWN LOUISE STARTED
WHEN HOWEVER SAINT-AIGNAN HAD FINISHED THE KING WHILE PREPARING TO RETIRE TO REST ASKED NOW SAINT-AIGNAN YOU KNOW WHAT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IS DO YOU NOT NOT ONLY WHAT SHE IS BUT WHAT SHE WILL BE WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT SHE IS EVERYTHING THAT WOMAN CAN WISH TO BE--THAT IS TO SAY BELOVED BY YOUR MAJESTY
THE NOBLES TOO FIGHT BETTER FOR A PRINCE WHOSE WIFE IS BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU EXTREMELY MADAME SAID PHILIP WITH SOME TEMPER
THE FIRST SENTINEL THEN SUMMONED A SECOND SENTINEL STATIONED WITHIN AN INNER LODGE WHO SHOWED HIS FACE AT THE GRATING AND INSPECTED THE NEW ARRIVAL MOST ATTENTIVELY
BESIDES IS IT LIKELY THAT MANICAMP SHOULD KNOW ANYTHING OF SUCH MATTERS
MESDEMOISELLES REPLIED LA VALLIERE BLUSHING AND ALMOST READY TO WEEP
FOUQUET I MUST CONFESS THAT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE SURPRISES ME WHAT MAY THAT BE SIRE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE AT THE HEAD OF THE DIOCESE A MAN LIKE M
AND YOU NO LONGER REGRET THEN THAT I DID NOT GIVE YOU THESE BRACELETS AS I AT FIRST INTENDED TO DO OH NO NO VERY WELL
AND HIS NAILS BURIED IN HIS BOSOM WERE THRUST INTO HIS FLESH BUT THE TRANQUIL EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE REMAINED UNALTERED
SILENCE SAID THE FRANCISCAN YOU CAN NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THE WHOLE TRUTH IS ALL IMPORTANT MONSEIGNEUR MONSEIGNEUR MURMURED GRISART SEND FOR THE CONFESSOR FOR IN TWO HOURS AT THE NEXT SEIZURE YOU WILL BE ATTACKED BY DELIRIUM AND WILL PASS AWAY IN ITS COURSE VERY WELL SAID THE PATIENT FOR A MOMENT CONTRACTING HIS EYEBROWS I HAVE STILL TWO HOURS TO LIVE THEN YES
THE ARTFUL LITTLE PUSS KEPT HER SECRET STRICTLY TO HERSELF WHEN SUDDENLY IT PROVED STRONGER THAN HERSELF AND SO ESCAPED HER AND FROM WHOM DID YOU GET THIS ABSURD TALE WHY AS EVERYBODY ELSE DID FROM LA VALLIERE HERSELF WHO CONFESSED HER LOVE TO MONTALAIS AND TONNAY-CHARENTE WHO WERE HER COMPANIONS MADAME STOPPED SUDDENLY AND BY A HASTY MOVEMENT LET GO HER HUSBAND'S HAND
WE ARE POOR WE SERVANTS OF THE KING AND FONTAINEBLEAU IS NO WAY TO BE COMPARED AS A RESIDENCE WITH VAUX QUITE TRUE REPLIED FOUQUET COOLLY
BE OFF AND I WILL TRY ON MY FONTAINEBLEAU COSTUME THE CHEVALIER LEFT THE ROOM CALLED HIS DIFFERENT ATTENDANT WITH THE GREATEST CARE AS IF HE WERE GIVING THEM DIFFERENT ORDERS
BUT AS IT WAS MY LOVE THAT YOU SOUGHT IT IS MY LOVE I NOW OFFER YOU OH
AS THE KING AND MADAME ENTERED THE VILLAGE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE CROWD
FROM THE LOOSENED BODY OF HER DRESS THE LACE FELL IN TUMBLED FOLDS MINGLING WITH THE TRESSES OF HER BEAUTIFUL FAIR HAIR WHICH LAY SCATTERED UPON HER SHOULDERS
IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN DATED YESTERDAY I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SHADOW OF UNEASINESS ON YOUR ACCOUNT FOUQUET SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
MONSIEUR QUITTED THE PRINCESS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE HUMOR AND FEELING GREATLY FATIGUED RETIRED TO HIS APARTMENTS LEAVING EVERY ONE TO FINISH THE NIGHT AS HE CHOSE
THE KING LOOKED AT HIM INWARDLY ENJOYING HIS FIRST TRIUMPH
THE LOOKS HE CAST FROM TIME TO TIME AT MADAME BECAME COLDER BY DEGREES AT THE CHILLING COMPLEXION OF HIS THOUGHTS
THE COURTIERS AS A STAR WHOSE LIGHT MIGHT SOME DAY BECOME THE FOCUS OF ALL FAVOR AND POWER
BUT TO CONTINUE
WHAT EXCLAIMED THE HOST TURNING TO MALICORNE ARE YOU NOT THIS GENTLEMAN'S FRIEND THEN WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHETHER I AM OR NOT PROVIDED YOU ARE PAID SAID MALICORNE PARODYING THE STRANGER'S REMARK IN A VERY MAJESTIC MANNER
IT WAS NOW MONTALAIS WHO WAS DISCONCERTED IN HER TURN
IS IT LIKELY I COULD HAVE FRIGHTENED YOU LA VALLIERE UTTERED A LOUD CRY
EVERY ONE LOOKED FOR WHAT MIGHT POSSIBLY HAPPEN IN THE GLANCE WHICH BEGAN TO BESTIR THE WORLD LIKE THE BROW OF JUPITER TONANS
FOUQUET HOWEVER SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY HIS SMILE FOR IN REALITY HE FELT AS IF HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN BY DEATH
THAT VOICE
SIX KNIGHTS OF MALTA WHOSE NAMES ARE WRITTEN HERE HAVE DISCOVERED BY THE INDISCRETION OF ONE OF THE AFFILIATED OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR THE THREE MYSTERIES
THE KING AND HIS COMPANION REDOUBLED THEIR SPEED AND AS THEY APPROACHED NEARER THE SIGHS THEY HAD HEARD WERE CHANGED INTO LOUD SOBS
BUT BUCKINGHAM SUCCEEDED IN DEMONSTRATING TO THE QUEEN THAT THERE WOULD BE GREAT IMPROPRIETY IN ALLOWING MADAME TO PROCEED TO PARIS ALMOST UNPROTECTED
FITTED UP WITHIN AND WITHOUT WITH THE RICHEST MATERIALS THAT DE GUICHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PROCURE IN LE HAVRE THEY COMPLETELY ENCIRCLED THE HOTEL DE VILLE
DE WARDES I WISH TO TALK WITH YOU
AND THE BLUISH OUTLINE OF THE GRAND MASSES OF WOODS WITH THEIR ROUNDED TOPS
HE ASSUMED NOBLE POSES IN HIS FAUTEUIL AND STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT WITH A FAMILIARITY WHICH TWO HOURS EARLIER WOULD HAVE DRAWN UPON HIM THREATS OF A CANING
IT IS UPON EARTH MADAME IMPORTANT EVENTS HAPPEN
YES BY THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
FOR I HAVE NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE SEEN FINER OAKS THAN IN THE ROYAL PARK AND AS SHE SPOKE SHE DIRECTED TOWARDS DE GUICHE A LOOK OF WHICH HE HAD NO REASON TO COMPLAIN AS HE HAD OF THE ONE THAT PRECEDED IT
WHY DO YOU SAY NEVER BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR BOTH OF US IN THAT CASE INSTEAD OF REGARDING YOU SIMPLY IMPRUDENT I CANNOT BUT CONSIDER YOU ABSOLUTELY MAD WHY ARE YOU PERFECTLY SURE--MIND ANSWER ME FRANKLY--THAT YOU DO NOT WISH HER WHOM YOU LOVE TO MAKE ANY SACRIFICE FOR YOU YES YES
THE KING SEATED HIMSELF IN AN EASY-CHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW SAYING
HONOR WHERE IT IS DUE
NOW OR NEVER IS THE TIME TO OFFER YOUR PLACE SAID FOUQUET IN ARAMIS'S EAR
BUT AS THE KING DID NOT SEEM TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE HEAVENS NO ONE MADE HIMSELF UNEASY ABOUT IT AND THE PROMENADE IN OBEDIENCE TO THE ORDERS GIVEN BY THE QUEEN TOOK ITS COURSE IN THE DIRECTION OF APREMONT
HER HEART REBOUNDED AT EACH ATTACK AND THEREFORE WHENEVER SHE WAS ATTACKED EVEN IN A MANNER THAT ALMOST STUNNED HER SHE RETURNED BLOW FOR BLOW TO ANY ONE IMPRUDENT ENOUGH TO TILT AGAINST HER
WHEN THE LIST WAS FINISHED THE DIFFERENT FACES OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN OMITTED OR FORGOTTEN FULLY EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT
IT IS LOYAL IN YOU TO SUBMIT YOURSELF VOLUNTARILY TO THIS DOUBLE PROOF
NOT PERHAPS IN THE SENSE YOU SUPPOSE BUT HE IS KIND AND GENEROUSLY DISPOSED TO OUR HOUSE YOU HAVE BAD NEWS TO COMMUNICATE TO ME MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN TURNING VERY PALE
YOU WERE CAPTAIN OF M
MAY HEAVEN FORGIVE ME IF I DIE WITHOUT THE HELP OF THIS LIVING PIECE OF HUMAN INFIRMITY THE CONFESSOR ON HIS SIDE REGARDED THE DYING MAN WITH ASTONISHMENT ALMOST WITH TERROR
I AM GOING TO FINISH MY LINES TO PHYLLIS AND THOSE LINES ARE A QUATRAIN
DOES DE GUICHE ANNOY YOU I DO NOT SAY HE DOES
AS SHE LEANED BACK ON THE SOFA ON WHICH SHE WAS SITTING MADAME DE BELLIERE COVERED THE PAPER WITH THE THICK FOLDS OF HER LARGE SILK DRESS AND SO CONCEALED IT
THE LANDLORD WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN TOGETHER
SHALL WE NEVER BE LEFT IN TRANQUILLITY PEOPLE WILL SAY I AM DEFICIENT IN TASTE
WHAT CAN I THROW INTO THE SEA TO AVERT APPROACHING EVIL
AND FOR THIS SIMPLE REASON THAT HE FINDS THE SAME WOMAN NEVER TWICE OF THE SAME MIND
MADAME LED A LIFE OF INCESSANT OCCUPATION
YOU CAME TO ASK ME TO AUTHORIZE A MARRIAGE AND YOU SEEM GREATLY DISTURBED IN HAVING TO MAKE THE REQUEST
UNKNOWN
NOW MONSIEUR MALICORNE SAID THE YOUNG GIRL DOES IT AT LENGTH PLEASE YOU THAT WE SHOULD TALK REASONABLY YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS VERY EASY MADEMOISELLE AURE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
SO DO PRAY ROUSE YOURSELF
THE PRINCE TURNED ROUND AS THE COUNT ENTERED AND PERCEIVING WHO IT WAS SAID
WOULD YOU NOT PREFER TO HAVE A RIVAL NEAR YOU WHOM YOU COULD WATCH AND INFLUENCE TO KNOWING THE KING IS WITH HER ALWAYS AS READY TO FLIRT AS TO BE FLIRTED WITH BY HER
FOR INSTANCE SUCH THINGS AS WE HAVE ON THE TABLE NOW
HER PRINCIPAL THOUGHT AND ONE THAT TOOK PRECEDENCE OF ALL OTHERS WAS TO DEVISE MEANS OF LEAVING THIS MONEY FOR M
THE PHYSICIAN AND THE CONFESSOR AFTER HAVING CONSULTED EACH OTHER BY LOOKS MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF TO PUSH ARAMIS ASIDE WHO HOWEVER WITH TWO SIGNS OF THE CROSS EACH MADE IN A DIFFERENT MANNER TRANSFIXED THEM BOTH IN THEIR PLACES
WHAT HE AGAIN EXCLAIMED AM I SERIOUSLY TOLD THAT I MUST LEAVE,--THAT I MUST EXILE MYSELF,--THAT I AM TO FLEE AT ONCE EXILE YOURSELF DID YOU SAY
AND FOR WHOM IS THE SECOND APPOINTMENT DESTINED ASKED DE GUICHE
ALL THE PERSONS PRESENT WERE MEN OF DISTINCTION OCCUPYING POSTS OF HONOR AND CREDIT AT THE COURT
YOU SEE SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIM IN A MANNER THAT SET HIS HEART ON FIRE YOU ARE FREE YOU ARE NOT SUSPECTED THE PEACE OF YOUR HOUSE IS NOT DISTURBED ALAS SAID THE KING AS YET YOU KNOW NOTHING FOR THE QUEEN IS JEALOUS MARIA THERESA STARK MAD WITH JEALOUSY
DURING THE LAST THREE DAYS MADAME HAS BEEN LIVING IN A PERFECT INTOXICATION OF GAYETY
BUCKINGHAM DESIRED THE CAPTAIN TO BE TOLD TO HOLD HIMSELF IN READINESS BUT THAT AS THE SEA WAS BEAUTIFUL AND AS THE DAY PROMISED A SPLENDID SUNSET HE DID NOT INTEND TO GO ON BOARD UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND WOULD AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE EVENING TO ENJOY A WALK ON THE STRAND
IS IT LIKELY MY DEAR COMTE YOU HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY A POETICAL MALADY AND ARE MAKING VERSES THE YOUNG MAN FORCED A SMILE UPON HIS LIPS WHILE A THOUSAND CONFLICTING SENSATIONS WERE MUTTERING DEFIANCE OF SAINT-AIGNAN IN THE DEEP RECESSES OF HIS HEART
ALL WENT OFF IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS
DE WARDES AND I WILL DO MY VERY UTMOST TO TAKE YOUR LIFE
FOUQUET FOR IT OH SAID BAISEMEAUX AS BELLE-ISLE IS THE PROPERTY OF M
IT IS ODIOUS MURMURED LOUISE
WITH THIS SIGN HE SAID YOU ARE THE MAN NEEDED TO SHAKE THE WORLD FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER
IT IS THE PERFECT ABNEGATION OF TWO WHO ARE DESIROUS OF BLENDING THEIR BEINGS INTO ONE
I TELL YOU BUCKINGHAM HAS HIRED ALL THE HOUSES SURROUNDING THE ONE WHICH THE QUEEN DOWAGER OF ENGLAND AND THE PRINCESS HER DAUGHTER WILL INHABIT HE IS SINGULAR ENOUGH INDEED SAID DE WARDES CARESSING HIS HORSE'S NECK
I CAN HARDLY RECOGNIZE YOUR HABITUAL PRUDENCE IN THAT M
HER WALK IS FULL OF MAJESTY HER ATTITUDE HAUGHTY
IT WAS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT A MOST ARISTOCRATIC ORIGIN MIGHT BE HUNTED UP BY THE HERALDS FOR THIS NAME OF MALICORNE
I TELL YOU I LOVE HER TO DISTRACTION MADAME STARTED AT THE VOICE
OR RATHER ADIEU TILL WE MEET AGAIN
BE FIRM AND QUICK BUCKINGHAM HAVING MADE SOME COMPLIMENTARY REMARK TO MADAME CONTINUED HIS WAY TOWARDS RAOUL WHO ADVANCED TO MEET HIM WHILE DE GUICHE REMAINED IN HIS PLACE THOUGH HE FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
FOR IT GIVES PRECEDENCE OVER ALL THE MARECHALS OF FRANCE RAOUL'S COLOR MOUNTED IN HIS FACE
SUCH IS MY OPINION MONSIEUR
OF COURSE CLOSE BESIDE THE OAK YOU ARE SPEAKING OF WHICH IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN IS CALLED THE ROYAL OAK--IS IT NOT SO MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN SAINT-AIGNAN AND THE KING EXCHANGED GLANCES
AS RAOUL ENTERED DE GUICHE WALKED UP TO HIM
AS FOR THE FRANCISCAN WHETHER OWING TO THE EFFECT OF THE ELIXIR OR WHETHER THE APPEARANCE OF ARAMIS HAD RESTORED HIS STRENGTH HE MADE A MOVEMENT AND HIS EYES GLARING HIS MOUTH HALF OPEN AND HIS HAIR DAMP WITH SWEAT SAT UP UPON THE BED
THE SERVANT PARTIALLY OPENED THE DOOR
DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES MONSIEUR HAD FELT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF AN IRRITATING NATURE CONCEALED UNDER HIS FAVORITE'S REMARKS
THAT YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE OF YOUR MOTHER IN THAT WAY WHAT NEED IS THERE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW HIS NAME
COME LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT BUT SHOW ME WHERE POOR LA VALLIERE IS WELL THOUGHT SAINT-AIGNAN THE KING'S REGARD IS BEGINNING TO DISPLAY ITSELF AND FOR THAT GIRL TOO
HE WHO SO FREQUENTLY AND SO UNJUSTLY MADE ME SUFFER THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM'S FATHER WAS PROBABLY MORE RESERVED AND MORE RESPECTFUL THAN HIS SON SAID PHILIP THOUGHTLESSLY NOT PERCEIVING HOW DEEPLY HE HAD WOUNDED HIS MOTHER'S FEELINGS
COMMAND AND YOU SHALL BE OBEYED ON THE CONDITION I REPEAT CONTINUED ATHOS
I SHALL HAVE FRIENDS WITHOUT FEARING THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS MY LOVERS
A MAN WHO LOVES READILY BETRAYS HIMSELF M
AT THE VERY MOMENT THE PRINCESS HAD PUT THIS QUESTION TO HER MOTHER DE GUICHE HAD AT LAST SUMMONED COURAGE TO RAISE HIS EYES TOWARDS HER AND COULD COMPARE THE ORIGINAL WITH THE PORTRAIT HE HAD SO LATELY SEEN
YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE PRINCESS'S SOCIETY COUNT FOR THE LAST EIGHT DAYS HAVE YOU NOT YES REPLIED DE GUICHE COLORING IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
WOULD SOME ONE ELSE BE JEALOUS IN SUCH A CASE OH
I AM DESIROUS OF OBTAINING FROM YOUR MAJESTY THAT WHICH I CANNOT ASK FOR MYSELF
I INSIST UPON IT
AND HIS HEART SIMPLER AND MORE YOUTHFUL THAN HE HAD IMAGINED IT TO BE HAD TO MEET THAT OTHER HEART THAT HAD REVEALED ITSELF TO HIM BY ITS ASPIRATIONS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE A CERTAIN TIME WILL BE NECESSARY SIRE TIME EXCLAIMED COLBERT TRIUMPHANTLY
I HAVE VERY FREQUENTLY HAD OCCASION TO REGRET SPAIN
DO YOU PRESUME TO THREATEN ME I AM THE SON OF THE COMTE DE LA FERE MY LORD AND I NEVER THREATEN BECAUSE I STRIKE FIRST
ARE NOT YOU OF MY OPINION MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE TO WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE DO YOU ALLUDE INQUIRED DE BRAGELONNE WITH AN ABSTRACTED AIR
I NO LONGER LOVE TO MADNESS RAOUL I AM BEING ENGULFED BY A WHIRLPOOL OF JEALOUSY RAOUL STRUCK HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH AN EXPRESSION RESEMBLING ANGER
YES WELL THEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK OF MADAME DO NOT HESITATE TO DO SO
WE HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNERS TOGETHER
ALL VERY WELL SAID THE OLD LADY
BUT BRING ME THE PROOF YOU SPEAK OF THE LACKEY QUITTED THE ROOM
WHENEVER THIS MAN IS ALWAYS TO BE FOUND BY HER SIDE OR IN ATTENDANCE AT THE DOOR OF HER CARRIAGE
THREE HOURS AFTERWARDS SHE WENT TO M
HOWEVER AS HE MIGHT REPRESENT THE KING--AND AFTER THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE RECORDED IT WAS VERY LIKELY--SHE GLANCED AT HER MIRROR DREW OUT STILL MORE THE RINGLETS OF HER HAIR AND DESIRED HIM TO BE ADMITTED
MY BROTHER MUST NOT KEEP YOU TOO LONG IN ENGLAND
IT IS SURELY WORTH ONE I THINK
WHENEVER WE GIRLS HAVE REASON TO CRY BECAUSE PERHAPS WE HAVE MISLAID OUR DRESSES OR BECAUSE OUR VANITY AS BEEN WOUNDED OR OUR COSTUME FAILS TO PRODUCE AN EFFECT LA VALLIERE LAUGHS AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THAT IS NOT MY CHARACTER SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
BECAUSE I THINK IT LESS DANGEROUS FOR YOU THAT I SHOULD COME HERE THAN THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO MY HOUSE
THE FORMER AFTER HAVING SALUTED THE PRINCE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT LIKE A SHARPSHOOTER WHO DELIBERATES BEFORE DECIDING IN WHAT DIRECTION HE WILL RENEW HIS FIRE
BUT AS IT MAKES ME FEEL SEA-SICK WOULD YOU PERMIT ME TO TURN MY BACK TOWARDS THEM YOU WILL OBSERVE MY LORD THAT IN TURNING YOUR BACK TO THEM YOU WILL HAVE THE SUN FULL IN YOUR FACE OH ITS RAYS ARE VERY FEEBLE AT THIS HOUR AND IT WILL SOON DISAPPEAR
AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE FAR WORSE AGREED
A FIFTEEN-FRANC BOARDER DOES NOT SUFFER HE SUFFERS IMPRISONMENT AT ALL EVENTS NO DOUBT
YET CONSIDERING THE DISORDERED STATE OF THE BRAIN THE HURRIED RESPIRATION THE RAPIDITY OF THE PULSE AND THE BURNING NATURE OF THE FEVER WHICH IS DEVOURING YOU AND WHICH HAS THRICE PROSTRATED ME SINCE THIS MORNING SAID THE MONK
LET US GO ON IF YOU PLEASE AND DISENGAGING HIS SWORD WITH A SINISTER CLASHING OF THE BLADE THE DUKE WOUNDED THE MARQUIS IN THE BREAST
MALICORNE KEPT THE PATERNAL MONEY-CHEST
THEN IN THE DISTANCE THE BLACK OUTLINE OF THE YACHT WITH ITS RIGGING TRACED UPON THE EMPURPLED BACKGROUND OF THE SKY--WHILE DOTTING THE HORIZON MIGHT BE SEEN HERE AND THERE VESSELS WITH THEIR TRIMMED SAILS LIKE THE WINGS OF A SEAGULL ABOUT TO PLUNGE
5 CHAPTER XLIX
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WHEN THE KING WAS THERE THESE WORDS UTTERED IN A PRECIPITATE MANNER AND IN AN AGITATED FERVID TONE OF VOICE MADE HER TWO COMPANIONS BETWEEN WHOM SHE WAS SEATED EXCLAIM IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED HER THE KING LA VALLIERE BURIED HER FACE IN HER HANDS
YOU ADDED EVEN THAT YOU HAD OBSERVED A DISPOSITION ON MADAME'S PART TO ENCOURAGE DE GUICHE PARDON ME MONSEIGNEUR I DID NOT SAY THAT YOU DID INDEED WELL IF I DID SAY SO I OBSERVED NOTHING BUT WHAT WAS VERY INOFFENSIVE AT ALL EVENTS YOU REMARKED SOMETHING YOU EMBARRASS ME MONSEIGNEUR WHAT DOES THAT MATTER
I REMEMBER IN FACT THAT IT WAS DEAR
AND THE SIDE BATTERIES ONLY AWAIT THEIR CANNON I KNOW ALL THAT MONSIEUR REPLIED THE KING
WHY NOT BECAUSE I AM TOO FULL OF HAPPINESS AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT HE REPLIED IN A TREMBLING VOICE
AND THAT I SHOULD SEE HIM RETURNING MUCH FASTER THAN HE WENT WITHOUT HAVING MYSELF GONE MUCH FARTHER THAN RIS OR MELUN--AND THAT EVEN WAS A GOOD DISTANCE YOU WILL ADMIT FOR IT IS ELEVEN LEAGUES TO GET THERE AND AS MANY TO RETURN MONTALAIS SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
LE HAVRE IS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE I SUPPOSE
BUT MADAME EXCLAIMED PHILIP STRIKING HIS HANDS TOGETHER ACT AS MY MOTHER AND NOT AS THE QUEEN SINCE I SPEAK TO YOU AS A SON
BAISEMEAUX RAN TO THE WINDOW LIKE A MADMAN
DE BRAGELONNE AND MYSELF ARE GREATER ENEMIES THAN EVER YOU ARE DECEIVED MONSIEUR AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED RETURNED RAOUL
BUT DE BRAGELONNE WISHES IT AND SO LET IT BE AND YET YOU DO NOT RESEMBLE THOSE EASY-TEMPERED FATHERS WHO VOLUNTEER AS STEPPING-STONES FOR THEIR CHILDREN SAID THE KING
AND FROM HIS CORNER REGARDED THE TEMPEST PASSING OVER
MALICORNE
DE GUICHE A ROOM AND A STABLE OF M
BUT MURMURED LA VALLIERE DOES MADAME KNOW THEN MADAME KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE MATTER THAN WE SAID EVEN SAID ATHENAIS IN A FORMAL PRECISE MANNER
THE SCOUNDREL IS GOING TO ASK YOU AGAIN FOR MORE MILLIONS TO PAY FOR HIS FIREWORKS AND HIS COLORED LAMPS COLBERT WAS THE FIRST TO SALUTE THEM AND WITH AN AIR WHICH HE ENDEAVORED TO RENDER RESPECTFUL
HE TOOK HIS MOTHER'S HAND AND KISSED IT ADDRESSED A FEW COMPLIMENTS TO MADAME UPON THE BEAUTY OF HER TOILETTE AND THEN BEGAN TO MAKE THE ROUND OF THE ASSEMBLY
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MADAME I IMPLORE YOU TO HASTEN YOUR DISEMBARKATION
IT IS THE KING WAS ABOUT TO PRONOUNCE THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE'S NAME WHEN HE STOPPED AND KNITTED HIS BROWS
THE WOMEN FLED LIKE A FLOCK OF TERRIFIED STARLINGS
BUT I WILL ANSWER YOU AS A TRUE FRIEND WELL DO SO VERY WELL
COME WITH ME I AM EXCEEDINGLY INDEBTED TO YOU MONSIEUR SAID MALICORNE
YOU WERE SAYING MONSIEUR CONTINUED DE GUICHE
AND LASTLY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU TO BE ALREADY UNHAPPY ENOUGH NOT TO WISH TO INCREASE YOUR UNHAPPINESS FURTHER FOUQUET STARTED FOR THESE WORDS RECALLED ALL THE ANXIETIES CONNECTED WITH HIS OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT--HE WHO FOR THE LAST FEW MINUTES HAD INDULGED IN ALL THE WILD ASPIRATIONS OF THE LOVER
VERY WELL I SHALL CONSULT M
BUT FOR MANY YEARS PAST--EXCEPT MADAME DE MOTTEVILLE AND LA MOLENA HER SPANISH NURSE A CONFIDANTE IN HER CHARACTER OF COUNTRYWOMAN AND WOMAN TOO--WHO COULD BOAST OF HAVING GIVEN GOOD ADVICE TO THE QUEEN
AND AS IF AT THE WAVE OF AN ENCHANTER'S WAND A THOUSAND ARMS AIDING INSTEAD OF INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER HAD CONSTRUCTED THE BUILDING AMIDST THE SOUND OF MUSIC
FOUR DAYS HAD ELAPSED SINCE HIS MARRIAGE AND MONSIEUR HAVING BREAKFASTED VERY HURRIEDLY PASSED INTO HIS ANTE-CHAMBER FROWNING AND OUT OF TEMPER
MALICORNE CRIED SHE AFTER HAVING READ IT IN TRUTH YOU ARE A GOOD LAD WHAT FOR MADEMOISELLE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAID FOR THIS COMMISSION AND YOU HAVE NOT AND SHE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH THINKING TO PUT THE CLERK OUT OF COUNTENANCE
ALL THESE THINGS WILL AT ONCE BE TAKEN TO SECOND BERTAUDIERE WITH A BOTTLE OF THAT VOLNAY WHICH YOU THINK SO EXCELLENT
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW HER FRIEND BUT RAOUL WITH GENTLE AUTHORITY DETAINED HER
DE WARDES BUT IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY TO THE KING
YOUR INDIFFERENCE WOULD KILL ME
GIVE ME BACK MY LETTER IT IS TRUE SAID THE DUKE YOU CANNOT OWE ME A GRUDGE ANY LONGER NOW FORGIVE ME DUKE
ON MY PART I FIND YOU HAVE A HARSH VOICE AND YOUR FACE IS TOO OFTEN DISTORTED WITH ANGER
FROM THE MOMENT WHEN AT BLOIS WHERE I WAS PINING AWAY MY EXISTENCE YOUR ROYAL LOOKS FULL OF LIGHT AND LIFE WERE FIRST BENT UPON ME
CHAPTER V
THERE WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE HE DARED NOT CONFESS EVEN TO HIMSELF
AH HE CRIED LOUDLY I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU FOR ME SAID DE GUICHE STARTING
TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE YOU SEE
YOUTH HAS ITS SUSPICIONS ITS FITS OF ANGER ITS PREJUDICES AS OLD AGE HAS ITS HATREDS ITS PRECAUTIONS AND ITS FEARS
AT THE PERIOD YOU ALLUDE TO SHE WAS SOMEWHAT LESS BRILLIANT AND SCARCELY SO PROUD EITHER
THE PRINCE FELT IT TO BE SO AND WITHDREW
THAT'S FAIR AND HE GAVE HIM THE TWENTY PISTOLES
BY THE AID OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH ISSUED FROM THIS LATTER THE PROFILE OF THE DUKE COULD BE DISTINCTLY SEEN AS HE INDOLENTLY RECLINED UPON THE CARVED BALCONY WITH ITS VELVET HANGINGS
WITH HIS OWN HANDS TOO HE PLACED UPON THE TABLE WITH MUCH SOLICITUDE THE BAG CONTAINING THE GOLD WHICH ONE OF THE SOLDIERS HAD BROUGHT UP WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL DEVOTION
NOW MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN SINCE WE ARE NO LONGER WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE KING'S PALACE AND SINCE WE CAN SPEAK OUT WITHOUT FAILING IN RESPECT TO PROPRIETY I WILL INFORM YOU WHY I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO REQUEST YOU TO VISIT ME HERE AND WHY I HAVE INVITED THESE GENTLEMEN TO BE PRESENT AT THE SAME TIME
PROUD AND DAUNTLESS MAN THOUGHT COLBERT YOU ACCEPT AND YET YOU KNOW IT WILL COST YOU TEN MILLIONS YOU HAVE RUINED ME WHISPERED FOUQUET IN A LOW TONE TO ARAMIS
HOW IS IT THAT ON THE VERY DAY THERE IS MUSIC AND A LITTLE SOCIETY IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS--IN MY OWN APARTMENTS INDEED FOR THEY ARE MINE--ON THE VERY DAY THAT I WISH TO AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE IN MY TURN EVERY ONE RUNS AWAY
MADAME TOO WORE SEVERAL COLORS AND PREFERRED RED FOR EMBROIDERY GRAY FOR DRESS AND BLUE FOR FLOWERS
OF MONSIEUR WITHOUT SPEAKING OF DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT YOU SUPPLIED THE PRINCESS'S HOUSEHOLD WITH THE LADIES OF HONOR
NO INDEED
NO INDEED
CHAPTER LXIV
AND A GREAT LORD CANNOT RHYME LIKE A BEGGARLY POET IT IS VERY UNFORTUNATE THOUGH THAT YOU ONLY REMEMBER THE TERMINATION STAY STAY I HAVE JUST RECOLLECTED THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND COUPLET WHY THERE'S THE BIRDCAGE WITH A PRETTY PAIR THE CHARMING MONTALAIS AND AND LA VALLIERE EXCLAIMED GUICHE IMPATIENTLY AND COMPLETELY IGNORANT BESIDES OF SAINT-AIGNAN'S OBJECT
THE FRANCISCAN CONTINUED,--"I REPEAT THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS STAYING IN THIS INN SO I HAVE HEARD THEY OUGHT TO BE EIGHT IN NUMBER THE JESUIT MADE A SIGN THAT HE UNDERSTOOD HIM
MA FOI THE SOUL IS SILLY AND THE HEART DRY BEWARE MONTALAIS I KNOW YOU SAID MALICORNE
IF HIS NOBLE COMPANION HAD STOLEN SOME FRUIT DESTINED FOR MADAME LA MARECHALE IF HE HAD BROKEN A MIRROR OR PUT OUT A DOG'S EYE MANICAMP DECLARED HIMSELF GUILTY OF THE CRIME COMMITTED AND RECEIVED THE PUNISHMENT WHICH WAS NOT MADE THE MILDER FOR FALLING ON THE INNOCENT
COLBERT IN THE CENTER OF A GROUP HE SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT
A MAN WHO MAKES DISTRICTS--DISTICHS I MEAN--AT FIFTEEN FRANCS
IN EVERY DIRECTION ALSO WERE GUARDS OF THE PROUDEST MILITARY BEARING WITH FLOATING PLUMES CROWDS OF ATTENDANTS AND COURTIERS IN THE ANTE-CHAMBERS AND UPON THE STAIRCASES
HE IS NOW IN PARIS
SO THAT I HAVE NO ROOM NO HOTEL NO LODGING
WHAT DO YOU ADVISE ME TO DO THEN INQUIRED DE GUICHE OF THE CHEVALIER
EVERY MOMENT IS PRECIOUS SAID THE LATTER HURRIEDLY
HOWEVER I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY AFFAIR IN THE WORLD OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN THIS ONE TELL ME THEN WHY WE PURCHASED THIS APPOINTMENT WHY IN ORDER TO RENDER HIM A SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AFTERWARDS OURSELVES OURSELVES
AND YET SIRE SAID MADAME AFFECTING A GENTLE YET SORROWFUL DETERMINATION NOTHING IS MORE URGENTLY NECESSARY
THEN AS IF EXHAUSTED BEFOREHAND BY THE STRUGGLE SHE HAD JUST UNDERGONE SHE THREW HERSELF ON HER KNEES IN UTTER ABANDONMENT BEFORE A LARGE COUCH IN WHICH SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER TREMBLING HANDS
TREMBLAY AND LOUVIERE RESIGNED THEIR APPOINTMENTS
DE GUICHE IS NOT IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS
BUT IN WHAT WAY NOTHING EASIER MY DEAR MONSIEUR MANICAMP SO MUCH THE BETTER
WE SHALL NOW FOLLOW THEM AND LEAVE THE CHEVALIER UNDISTURBED TO HIS CORRESPONDENCE
BUT IF I WERE CALLED UPON TO SELL OR TO BUY I SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH THE GOLD OF THE SETTINGS ALONE AS MY PROFIT UPON THE TRANSACTION
BUT WHEREABOUTS DOES HE WALK WHAT A QUESTION TO ASK
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE COME HOW CAN YOUR LORDSHIP IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD EVER INCONVENIENCE ME CONFESS YOU WERE GOING IN SEARCH OF MONEY NO STAMMERED OUT BAISEMEAUX NO
MADLY ENOUGH TO DIE FROM IT WHETHER YOU DRIVE ME FROM YOU OR WHETHER YOU LISTEN TO ME STILL IT IS A HOPELESS CASE SHE SAID IN A PLAYFUL MANNER
AND THUS HAD THE SECRETS OF TWO HEARTS REVEALED BENEATH THE SHADES OF EVENING AND AMID THE RECESSES OF THE WOODS
D'ARTAGNAN WITH WHOM HE IS NOT EVEN ACQUAINTED WHAT MONSIEUR SAID DE WARDES SETTING HIS TEETH HARD TOGETHER AND RESTING THE POINT OF HIS SWORD ON THE TOE OF HIS BOOT DO YOU ASSERT THAT I DO NOT KNOW M
IT WAS THIS EVEN THAT THE QUEEN-MOTHER AS SURPRISED AS THE OTHERS BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE HASTENED TO TELL THE YOUNG QUEEN AND PHILIP D'ORLEANS
WERE WE NOT BROUGHT UP TOGETHER
IT IS A SERVICE YOU ARE RENDERING ME COME CONFESS DEAR M
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WOMEN IN QUESTION HAVE LAUGHTER ON THEIR SIDE AS A MEANS OF VENGEANCE
DANAE MEANS A SHOWER OF GOLD DOES IT NOT THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE JUPITER OF DANAE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A SHOWER OF GOLD FOR HER MY LOVER THEN HE WHOM YOU ASSIGN ME I BEG YOUR PARDON
ARAMIS FOLLOWED HIM MOST ANXIOUSLY WITH HIS EYES AND BAISEMEAUX RETURNED PLACED THE REGISTER UPON THE TABLE AND TURNED OVER THE LEAVES FOR A MINUTE AND STAYED AT THE LETTER M
IF YOU LOVE MADAME MONSEIGNEUR HE SAID THAT OUGHT TO BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NO FURTHER NEED OF YOUR FRIENDS NOT BAD NOT BAD MURMURED MANICAMP
FAUCHEUX THE JEWELER TOOK HIS MAGNIFYING-GLASS AND SCALES WEIGHED AND INSPECTED THEM AND SILENTLY MADE HIS CALCULATIONS
I WISH TO TALK TO YOU YOU SHALL NOT SPEAK TO ME GUICHE UNTIL YOU HAVE FIRST ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS PROCEED THEN YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM CAN YOU IMAGINE WHY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT BECAUSE HE IS IN LOVE WITH MADAME IS IT NOT ONE COULD ALMOST SWEAR TO IT TO OBSERVE HIM YOU ARE MISTAKEN
LA VALLIERE SEATED IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM LOOKED ON THOUGHTFULLY
YOUR MAJESTY KNOWS ALL THAT REPLIED THE MUSKETEER STUPEFIED
THAT I HAVE SOME ONE TO BREAKFAST WITH ME AND THAT PREPARATIONS ARE TO BE MADE ACCORDINGLY AND YOU RANG THRICE
IN SUCH A CASE HE CEASES TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF
SOME ONE IN FACT WAS APPROACHING
IT WAS OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR LORDSHIP THAT I MADE THE REMARK I AM AWARE OF THAT M
WELL HE MURMURED SEEING HIS FRIEND ENTER BAREHEADED WITH A WILD GAZE AND TOTTERING GAIT
YOU SHOULD THE LESS OBJECT TO THEM MONSIEUR ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSE OF PRIORITY YOU HAVE PERMITTED YOURSELF TO EXERCISE ABUSE MOST ASSUREDLY
I TRUST ALSO SAID D'ARTAGNAN APPROACHING THE YOUNG MAN CLOSELY THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER SPEAK ILL OF ANY ONE AS IT SEEMS YOU HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE HABIT OF DOING
RAOUL FOR THREE DAYS PAST MY BRAIN HAS BEEN ON FIRE
WHAT AN ADMIRABLE SITUATION YOURS IS CAPTAIN HE CONTINUED AFTER A PAUSE
CHECKED BY THE IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OBLIGED OUT OF POLITENESS TO MAKE HIS OWN EXCUSES WHEN HE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THEM THE CHEVALIER STEPPED BACK A FEW PACES
I AM A LOST MAN YOUR DESPAIR QUITE DISTRESSES ME VANNES VANNES CRIED BAISEMEAUX
IF I ONLY THOUGHT THAT WELL I WOULD REDOUBLE THE SURVEILLANCE OH HE DOES NOT SEEM TO WISH TO ESCAPE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT PRISONERS ARE HAS HE ANY BOOKS NONE
DEATH THEN ALWAYS STARED US IN THE FACE WAR HARDENED US AND THE CARDINAL PRESSED US SORELY
IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF SIRE SO MUCH THE WORSE
BESIDE HER HORSE ANOTHER'S ALWAYS GALLOPS WHICH IS NOT MINE
AND THEY WHO UNTIL THAT MOMENT HAD LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH RESTLESS UNCERTAINTY FRATERNIZED ON THE SPOT
THIS WAS THE PLACE BUCKINGHAM USUALLY OCCUPIED
I HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO CONVEY MADAME SAFE AND SOUND TO FRANCE AND I SHALL KEEP MY PROMISE BUT SIR CONTINUED BUCKINGHAM
AND WHEN MORALLY SPEAKING SHE HAD SACRIFICED HER HONOR IN LISTENING TO HIM SHE SAW HERSELF REPAID FOR HER SACRIFICE BY AN INFIDELITY THE MORE HUMILIATING SINCE IT WAS OCCASIONED BY A WOMAN FAR BENEATH HER IN THE WORLD
THE DROOPING OF THE HIND-QUARTERS WOULD ALMOST MAKE ME DOUBT THE PURITY OF ITS GERMAN BREED AND I THINK THERE IS ENGLISH BLOOD IN HIM
THE HEADS OF SEVEN OR EIGHT MUSKETEERS APPEARED
ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR PLANS AND YOUR MEASUREMENTS FOR YOU KNOW THAT NO ONE IS ALLOWED NOT ARCHITECTS EVEN TO ENTER WHERE THE PRISONERS ARE WITH PAPER PENS OR PENCIL GOOD SAID ARAMIS TO HIMSELF IT SEEMS I AM AN ARCHITECT THEN
MONTALAIS MONTALAIS FOR PITY'S SAKE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE AFTER HAVING BEEN SO CRUEL SHOW ME A LITTLE MERCY THESE WORDS UTTERED WITH ALL THE FERVOR OF A PRAYER EFFACED ALL TRACE OF IRONY IF NOT FROM MONTALAIS'S HEART AT LEAST FROM HER FACE
HIS DOWNCAST EYES SHOWED THE ATTENTIVE MAN BUT THE RESTLESS HAND BETRAYED THE MAN ABSORBED IN THOUGHT--ARAMIS WAS MEDITATING
SHE HEARD THE EXPLOSION OF MATERNAL ANGER AND AS SHE DIVINED THE CAUSE OF IT SHE ENTERED THE CHAMBER TREMBLING AND PERCEIVED THE UNLUCKY MALICORNE WHOSE WOEFUL COUNTENANCE MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED OR SET LAUGHING WHOEVER OBSERVED IT COOLLY
CHAPTER XLVII
SOME LITTLE TIME AGO I WAS RETURNING THERE AFTER I HAD BEEN RUNNING ABOUT AFTER YOU
THIS PASTY THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED THESE CRAWFISH FROM THE RIVER MARNE OF WHICH WE HAVE HARDLY TAKEN ANY AND WHICH ARE ALMOST AS LARGE AS LOBSTERS
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT YOU POSSESS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWELS IN PARIS
WHY SAID HE SHOULD I OCCUPY MYSELF ANY LONGER ABOUT MY COUSIN
YOU WILL SEE THAT IT IS CLAIMED
AND IN HIS ATTACHMENTS HE IS SO DISCREET THAT BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY CONQUESTS MAY REGARD THEIR LOT AS MORE THAN ENVIABLE
THE DUKE'S SWORD SUNK AS HIS ARM WAS LOWERED
THE DUKE MUST BE AS SICK OF ME AS I AM OF HIM
NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION AND WHEN YOU THINK ALL IS LOST SOMETHING WILL BE DISCOVERED WHICH WILL RETRIEVE EVERYTHING WHO WILL DISCOVER THIS WONDERFUL SOMETHING YOURSELF I
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER SIRE ALAS
YOU WHO THROUGH MY MEANS HAVE TEN TIMES CROSSED THE ABYSS YAWNING AT YOUR FEET AND IN WHICH HAD YOU BEEN ALONE YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY SWALLOWED
WHEN ON DUTY HE IS TO BE MET WITH AT THE LOUVRE,--WHEN NOT ON DUTY IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS
VERY GAY AND LIVELY NONSENSE
SPARE ME SIRE
TO WHICH REMARK MADAME REPLIED THAT WHENEVER THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE FAMILY KEPT ALOOF OUT OF RESPECT AS SHE SAID THIS SHE MADE SO FUNNY AND SO PRETTY A GRIMACE THAT DE GUICHE AND MANICAMP COULD NOT CONTROL THEMSELVES
AND WHEN THIS ANOINTMENT WAS COMPLETED HE HAD HIMSELF WRAPPED IN FLANNELS AND PLACED IN A WARM BED
BESIDES M
NO DOUBT OF IT RETURNED THE GOVERNOR MY PRISONERS ARE MY INCOME I BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT AND SO THERE ARE NO ORDERS REPEATED BAISEMEAUX WITH A SIGH
I THINK SIRE HE REPLIED THAT M
LORET BY THIS NYMPH
AND I HAVE LEFT MY TENANTS IN ORDER TO PLACE MY SERVICES AT YOUR MAJESTY'S COMMANDS EVERY WORD FELL DISTINCTLY IN PERFECT HARMONY AND ELOQUENCE UPON LOUIS XIV.'S EARS
ON HIS ARRIVAL HE WENT AT ONCE TO ARAMIS WHO HAD NOT YET RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
THE COUNT DE GUICHE COULD NOT SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM BUCKINGHAM AND WHILE PLAYING CONVERSED WITH HIM UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS PROJECTED VOYAGE
AND YET I WAS ABOUT TO FACE THE SPANISH CANNON OR THE HALBERDS OF THE WALLOONS
LOUIS XIV
LOUIS XIV
LE COMTE DE LA FERE IS YOUR FRIEND SAY YOU FOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ASK HIM IF HE KNOWS WHY HE IS HERE THIS GENTLEMAN REQUESTS ME TO ASK YOU SAID BAISEMEAUX IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE CAUSE OF YOUR IMPRISONMENT NO MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN UNAFFECTEDLY I AM NOT THAT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE SAID ARAMIS CARRIED AWAY BY HIS FEELINGS IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
GO AWAY MALICORNE
THE FIRST TO WHOM I WISH TO SPEAK SAID THE DYING MAN IS A GERMAN FROM VIENNA WHOSE NAME IS BARON DE WOSTPUR
SUDDENLY SOMETHING FELL THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A COLOSSAL SHEET OF FLAME FOLLOWED BY A LOUD BUT DISTANT RUMBLING NOISE
THE QUEEN REPLIED BY ACCUSATIONS MINGLED WITH SIGHS AND SOBS AMONG WHICH MONSIEUR OFTEN DISTINGUISHED THE WORD BANOS WHICH MARIA THERESA ACCENTUATED WITH SPITEFUL ANGER
SHE IS CLEVER AND WITTY AND HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COQUETRY VERY NATURAL IN A YOUNG WOMAN
AS HE RECOVERED HIS SELF-POSSESSION RAOUL FANCIED HE RECOGNIZED VOICES ON HIS RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO HIM AND HE PERCEIVED DE WARDES DE GUICHE AND THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE CONVERSING TOGETHER
DE WARDES CONTINUED
SUCH AN ACT WOULD SOW JEALOUSY AMONGST MY NOBILITY ATHOS BOWED AND REMAINED SILENT
MADAME WHOSE ATTENTION HAD BEEN AROUSED BY THE NOISE TURNED HER HEAD FOR A MOMENT TO OBSERVE THE CAUSE OF IT AND THEN SLIGHTLY SMILING AGAIN ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HER FAITHFUL GUARDIANS RAOUL AND DE GUICHE WHO WERE QUIETLY RIDING AT HER CARRIAGE DOORS
IN APPROACHING VINCENNES MARQUISE MY ARDENT ASPIRATIONS APPROACH NEARER TO THAT OBJECT TOWARDS WHICH THEY HAVE FOR SOME DAYS PAST BEEN DIRECTED THE MARQUISE SUDDENLY RAISED HER HEAD
I HAVE ALREADY OBTAINED FOR YOU WHAT TWELVE HUNDRED WOMEN ARE TRYING FOR AND FOR THAT I WAS FORCED TO EMPLOY ALL MY DIPLOMACY OH
FOR SOME TIME PAST SUFFERING MOST ACUTELY AND LOSING BOTH HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY WITH THAT RAPIDITY WHICH SIGNALIZES THE DECLINE OF WOMEN FOR WHOM LIFE HAS BEEN ONE LONG CONTEST ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD IN ADDITION TO HER PHYSICAL SUFFERINGS TO EXPERIENCE THE BITTERNESS OF BEING NO LONGER HELD IN ANY ESTEEM EXCEPT AS A SURVIVING REMEMBRANCE OF THE PAST AMIDST THE YOUTHFUL BEAUTIES WITS AND INFLUENTIAL FORCES OF HER COURT
BUT IF SIX EIGHT OR TEN OTHERS SHOULD STILL BE MET WITH HE EITHER SETS SPURS TO HIS HORSE IF HE SHOULD STILL HAPPEN TO RETAIN ONE OR LETS HIMSELF BE SLAIN TO SAVE AN IGNOMINIOUS FLIGHT
I AM NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE CHANCE OF WINNING AND IF I BE THE WINNER YOU ARE SURE OF ME OH
I TREAT MY ADMIRERS HARSHLY BUT WITHOUT ANY PRETENTION TO RETAIN THEM
IT IS MY WISH THEREFORE TO MARRY HER MONSIEUR AND I HAVE COME TO SOLICIT YOUR CONSENT TO MY MARRIAGE WHILE THIS COMMUNICATION WAS BEING MADE TO HIM ATHOS MAINTAINED THE PROFOUNDEST SILENCE AND RESERVE
MONTALAIS AGILE AS A DEER ATHENAIS EAGER AS A YOUNG WOLF BOUNDED THROUGH THE DRY GRASS AND NOW AND THEN SOME BOLD ACTEON MIGHT BY THE AID OF THE FAINT LIGHT HAVE PERCEIVED THEIR STRAIGHT AND WELL-FORMED LIMBS SOMEWHAT DISPLAYED BENEATH THE HEAVY FOLDS OF THEIR SATIN PETTICOATS
SHE IS NOT A COQUETTE HE REPLIED
THE FACT IS I WISH TO GIVE A FETE AT FONTAINEBLEAU--TO KEEP OPEN HOUSE FOR FIFTEEN DAYS AND I SHALL REQUIRE AND HE STOPPED GLANCING AT COLBERT
HOWEVER AS HE HIMSELF HAD JUST SAID HE WAS BRAVE
NONE OF THE LADIES WHO HAD RECEIVED INVITATIONS APPEARED IN THE COSTUMES OF THE FETE AS THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HAD PREDICTED BUT MANY CONVERSATIONS TOOK PLACE ABOUT THE RICH AND INGENIOUS TOILETTES DESIGNED BY DIFFERENT PAINTERS FOR THE BALLET OF THE DEMI-GODS FOR THUS WERE TERMED THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF WHICH FONTAINEBLEAU WAS ABOUT TO BECOME THE PANTHEON
MALICORNE HAD LONG BEEN ONE OF HER ANTIPATHIES
FOOTNOTES
WE SHALL BE ADMIRABLY PLACED UPON THAT LITTLE THEATRE
I WILL HAVE HIM DROWNED IN MY FISH-POND THE VERY NEXT TIME I FIND HIM IN MY APARTMENTS AGAIN HAVING LAUNCHED THIS TERRIBLE THREAT THE PRINCE EXPECTED HIS MOTHER WOULD BE FRIGHTENED OUT OF HER SENSES
AND IF YOUR MAJESTY'S MEMORY WERE TO BE AWAKENED IN A DISAGREEABLE SENSE IT WOULD BE A PERPETUAL MENACE HANGING OVER THE HEAD OF THIS IMPRUDENT GIRL SAINT-AIGNAN I DO NOT THINK AS YOU DO YOUR MAJESTY DOUBTLESS SEES MORE CLEARLY THAN MYSELF WELL
YOU EXPOSE THE LIVES OF MANY OTHERS WITHOUT REFERRING TO YOUR OWN WHICH SEEMS TO BE FULL OF HAZARD
LE TERRAIN DE DIEU
CHAPTER LXV
THEY BELONG TO THE COURT AND THE ONE WHO SPOKE OF ME HAD A REMARKABLY SWEET VOICE AH
MONSIEUR'S JEALOUSY ARISES FROM HERS
BUT DESCRIBE HIM TO US
WE CAN TRAVEL TOGETHER LIKE TWO EXCELLENT FRIENDS
CERTAINLY WE CAN THE TICKETS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO EACH ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER LISTED
BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT SATISFACTION CAN I GIVE MY BROTHER MY DEPARTURE YOU REPEAT THAT WORD EXCLAIMED THE KING IMPRUDENTLY AS IF DURING THE LAST TEN MINUTES SUCH A CHANGE HAD BEEN PRODUCED THAT MADAME WOULD HAVE HAD ALL HER IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT THOROUGHLY CHANGED
AT THE VERY TIME M
WHY SHOULD THIS BE THE CASE UNLESS IT BE TO ENJOY THE PLEASURES OF MY KITCHEN
I RESIGN MY OFFICE OF INVENTOR THEN I WILL BE IT SO
THE CONFESSOR RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE BARON DE WOSTPUR WHO WALKED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD RAISED AS IF HE WERE DISCUSSING WITH HIMSELF THE POSSIBILITY OF TOUCHING THE CEILING WITH THE FEATHER IN HIS HAT
BUT OTHERS ONLY LAUGHED AT THE FITS OF SULKINESS IN WHICH THESE VENERABLE INDIVIDUALS INDULGED WHO HAD CARRIED THE LOVE OF AUTHORITY SO FAR AS EVEN TO TAKE COMMAND OF BODIES OF SOLDIERS IN THE WARS OF THE FRONDE IN ORDER AS MADAME ASSERTED NOT TO LOSE THEIR INFLUENCE OVER MEN ALTOGETHER
BUT STAY WHAT IS IT MONSEIGNEUR I WISH TO SEE HIM BEFOREHAND
YOU CALL YOUR SHEPHERDS TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS
AND THAT OF THE SHEPHERD AMYNTAS IN PARTICULAR I SUPPOSE SAID MADAME
AT THIS MOMENT YOU WOULD ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE THROWN OUT OF THAT WINDOW RATHER THAN ALLOW ME TO KISS THE TIP OF YOUR FINGER
HER PRIDE AND HER THIRST FOR HOMAGE WERE SATISFIED
AND WHAT DOES MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS REQUIRE OF ME MALICORNE DREW FOUR LETTERS FROM HIS POCKET WHICH HE OFFERED TO RAOUL
A SERVANT APPEARED
ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU IS TO INCREASE YOUR RATIONS GIVE YOU A GLASS OF PORT WINE NOW AND THEN SLIP IN A BISCUIT FOR YOU BETWEEN A COUPLE OF PLATES GREAT HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN FALLING BACKWARD AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND
YOUNG AS I AM I HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED HUMILIATION AND HAVE ENDURED DISDAIN HERE
A ROYAL COURT
CAPRICIOUS VARIABLE CLOSE GIDDY FREE PRUDISH A VIRGIN ARMED WITH CLAWS ERIGONE STAINED WITH GRAPES SHE SOMETIMES OVERTURNED WITH A SINGLE DASH OF HER WHITE FINGERS OR WITH A SINGLE PUFF FROM HER LAUGHING LIPS THE EDIFICE WHICH HAD EXHAUSTED MALICORNE'S PATIENCE FOR A MONTH
I AM CERTAIN YOURS ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WHEN CAN YOU DO SO IN LESS THAN THREE DAYS TIME VERY WELL THE REMAINDER YOU WILL DISPOSE OF AMONG PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
DE MANICAMP WAS AT ORLEANS
GUICHE'S ASSIDUITY
THE CRY OF HELP
HER WAGGISH AND MALICIOUS LOOK WHICH RAOUL TRIED TO AVOID MEETING AND WHICH YET HE SOUGHT INQUIRINGLY FROM TIME TO TIME PLACED HIM ON THE RACK
YOU BELIEVE I AM DECEIVING YOU WHEN I ASSURE YOU OF MY AFFECTION YES WHAT MAKES YOU SO SUSPICIOUS ONE THING WHAT IS IT
I WISH TO MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH HER
YOU SWALLOW UP TWO FORTUNES--MINE AND THAT OF M
AND YET YOU DO NOT GO INTO ECSTASIES ABOUT THEM LOUISE
WE HAVE ESCAPED WELL SAID MONTALAIS
INDEED IN THE YEAR 1662 THE DISSATISFACTION OF MONSIEUR WITH MADAME AND THE KING'S INTERVENTION IN THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF MONSIEUR WAS A MATTER OF NO INCONSIDERABLE MOMENT
HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND HIM LIKE A MAN BEWILDERED
AND ON RECOGNIZING BAISEMEAUX HE AROSE AND SALUTED HIM COURTEOUSLY
WHY SHOULD THERE BE ANY GREATER TRUTH IN THE REPORT OF TO-DAY THAN IN THAT OF YESTERDAY OR IN THAT OF YESTERDAY THAN IN THAT OF TO-DAY TO MONSIEUR IN RELATING TO HIM THE ADVENTURE OF THE ROYAL OAK SHE SAID ARE YOU NOT VERY ABSURD IN YOUR JEALOUSIES MY DEAR PHILIP
WHAT DO YOU SAY REPLIED THE PRINCE
THE WHOLE POPULATION OF LE HAVRE HURRIED TOWARDS THE JETTIES AND EVERY LOOK WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE LITTLE BARK
WHILE THEY THEMSELVES CONTINUE UNTOUCHED THEY ROUGHLY BREAK OFF WITH EVERY ONE WHO MAY POSSIBLY INTERFERE WITH THEIR LITTLE CALCULATIONS OF SELF COMFORT
A THOUSAND COMPLIMENTS EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE UPON WHOSE LIPS A COURTIER'S JEST WAS ALREADY FITTING BUT TO WHOM THE WORD AFFIANCED ADDRESSED BY MALICORNE WITH RESPECT TO MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS RECALLED THE RESPECT DUE TO WOMEN
DO YOU POSSESS THE SECRET WHICH YOU PROMISED IN YOUR REQUEST ADDRESSED TO THE GRAND COUNCIL MONSEIGNEUR LET US PROCEED HOWEVER IN DUE ORDER SAID THE MONK
6 CHAPTER LIII
DO NOT BE ABSURD DE WARDES THERE ARE SOME VERY CHARACTERISTIC AND INGENIOUS LATIN AXIOMS ABOUT LAME LADIES GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN SAID DE GUICHE LOOKING AT RAOUL WITH UNEASINESS BE A LITTLE CAREFUL I ENTREAT YOU BUT THE UNEASINESS OF THE COUNT IN APPEARANCE AT LEAST WAS NOT NEEDED
THE CARDINAL APPROACHED THE EAR OF THE DYING MAN AND SAID WELL MONSEIGNEUR I KNOW THAT THE KING OF FRANCE HAS DETERMINED THAT AT THE VERY FIRST PRETEXT A DEATH FOR INSTANCE EITHER THAT OF THE KING OF SPAIN OR THAT OF A BROTHER OF THE INFANTA FRANCE WILL ARMS IN HAND CLAIM THE INHERITANCE AND I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION ALREADY PREPARED THE PLAN OF POLICY AGREED UPON BY LOUIS XIV
I HAVE THE HONOR TO PRESENT MY MOST HUMBLE RESPECTS TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING
HE USED TO SAY WHENEVER YOU ARE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM TWO AFFECTIONS CHOOSE THAT WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE LEAST TROUBLE AND I WILL ALLOW YOU TO RETAIN IT
I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING TOO MUCH
HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND FOLLOWED HIS FATHER INTO THE GARDEN
FAUCHEUX'S HOUSE AND RECEIVED FROM HIM EIGHT HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD INCLOSED IN A CHEST WHICH ONE OF THE CLERKS COULD HARDLY CARRY TOWARDS MADAME FAUCHEUX'S CARRIAGE--FOR MADAME FAUCHEUX KEPT HER CARRIAGE
AND ON WHAT ACCOUNT SHOULD I HAVE HAD YOU TURNED OUT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY IMPERTINENT FOR THAT OH THAT,--YES THAT'S TRUE YOU SEE PLAINLY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO AVOW IT SAID MALICORNE
THENCE THEY ARRIVED AT THE DRAWBRIDGE WHERE THE SENTINELS ON DUTY RECEIVED THE GOVERNOR WITH THE PROPER HONORS
WHEN THE BRACELETS REACHED THESE TWO LATTER NO ONE APPEARED TO TAKE ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF THEM
AND WHEN THEY PERCEIVED THAT THEIR OVER-CURIOUS LISTENERS WERE SUFFICIENTLY NEAR SO THAT NOT A SYLLABLE OF WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY COULD BE LOST THEY ADDRESSED TOWARDS THEM VERY INNOCENTLY IN THE MOST ARTLESS MANNER IN THE WORLD INDEED A PASSIONATE DECLARATION WHICH FROM THE VANITY NATURAL TO ALL MEN AND EVEN TO THE MOST SENTIMENTAL OF SHEPHERDS SEEMED TO THE TWO LISTENERS AS SWEET AS HONEY THE KING AT THESE WORDS WHICH THE ASSEMBLY WAS UNABLE TO HEAR WITHOUT LAUGHING COULD NOT RESTRAIN A FLASH OF ANGER DARTING FROM HIS EYES
MALICORNE WAS A VILE NAME
COME MY DAUGHTER COME CONTINUED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY
THEY REACHED THE THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING QUITE ALONE AND OF CONFIDING THEIR TROUBLES MORE FREELY TO EACH OTHER WHEN SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF VOICES STRUCK UPON THEIR EARS AH AH SAID THOSE WHO SURROUNDED THE NARRATOR
A MOMENT COMTE
MADAME FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE AND EVEN MONSIEUR HIMSELF COULD NOT RESIST IT AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AS FOR LAUGHING HE COULD SCARCELY KEEP HIS EQUILIBRIUM
HE IMMEDIATELY CONJECTURED THAT THE QUEEN HAD A REQUEST TO MAKE OF HIM
LET US LISTEN THE KING APPROACHED NEARER TO LA VALLIERE AND AS THE RAIN DRIPPED MORE AND MORE THROUGH THE FOLIAGE OF THE OAK HE HELD HIS HAT OVER THE HEAD OF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO RAISED HER BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES TOWARDS THE ROYAL HAT WHICH SHELTERED HER AND SHOOK HER HEAD SIGHING DEEPLY AS SHE DID SO
YOU SEND ME AWAY SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WHO WAS DYING TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE FRIEND
THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF ADDED WHATEVER YOU DO MANICAMP BE CAREFUL THAT THIS PROJECT OF BUCKINGHAM'S IS NOT MADE KNOWN TO ANY FRENCHMAN HERE
YOU ARE VERY CRUEL MADAME HE SAID
DO YOU WISH TO GO TO PARIS ALAS SIGHED LOUISE
SURELY A MAN IS ALLOWED TO WRITE A LOVE-LETTER TO A WOMAN A MAN CERTAINLY
BUT TRUE REPLIED DE GUICHE
I CAN KEEP THREE QUITE AS WELL AS ONE MALICORNE AND MONTALAIS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER LIKE CHILDREN DETECTED IN A THEFT
STAY I HARDLY KNOW WHAT STORY RECURS TO MY MEMORY OF SOME SILLY OR MELANCHOLY GIRL WHO WAS GRADUALLY PINING AWAY BECAUSE SHE FANCIED THAT THE PRINCE OR THE KING OR THE EMPEROR WHOEVER IT WAS--AND IT DOES NOT MATTER MUCH WHICH--HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER
THE DUC D'ORLEANS IS TRADITIONALLY CALLED MONSIEUR AND HIS WIFE MADAME GASTON THE KING'S UNCLE CURRENTLY HOLDS THAT TITLE
BUT LA VALLIERE GENTLE AND RESIGNED AS USUAL EXHIBITED NOTHING OF THE SORT
COLLECT EVERY MEANS OF ATTACK WHICH MAY BE SERVICEABLE AGAINST OTHERS
PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN ON THIS POINT AND AROUND YOU AS AROUND MYSELF IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO MEET WITH A DISAGREEABLE-LOOKING FACE WHILST THE KING WAS SPEAKING MADAME HAD RISEN FROM HER SEAT LOOKED AROUND THE GREENSWARD AND AFTER A CAREFUL AND SILENT EXAMINATION SHE CALLED THE KING TO HER SIDE AND SAID SEE YONDER SIRE UPON THE DECLIVITY OF THAT LITTLE HILL NEAR THAT GROUP OF GUELDER ROSES THAT BEAUTIFUL GIRL WALKING ALONE HER HEAD DOWN HER ARMS HANGING BY HER SIDE WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE FLOWERS WHICH SHE CRUSHES BENEATH HER FEET LIKE ONE WHO IS LOST IN THOUGHT MADEMOISELLE DE VALLIERE DO YOU MEAN REMARKED THE KING
WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WHEN YOU OFFENDED THIS YOUNG MAN IN OFFENDING HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS TO ME RETURNED DE WARDES THAT LIBERTY OF SPEECH IS ALLOWED WHEN IT IS SUPPORTED BY EVERY MEANS WHICH A MAN OF COURAGE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL TELL ME WHAT THE MEANS ARE BY WHICH A MAN OF COURAGE CAN SUSTAIN A SLANDEROUS EXPRESSION THE SWORD YOU FAIL NOT ONLY IN LOGIC IN YOUR ARGUMENT BUT IN RELIGION AND HONOR
THIRD IN THE ORDER THAT WE PUBLISHED BUT SECOND IN TIME SEQUENCE TEN YEARS LATER
BUT THAT HAPPINESS WAS NEVER OURS IN THAT CASE MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IT BELONGS TO KINGS TO REPAIR THE WANT OF OPPORTUNITY AND MOST DELIGHTEDLY DO I UNDERTAKE TO REPAIR IN YOUR INSTANCE AND WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DELAY THE WRONGS OF FORTUNE TOWARDS YOU NAY SIRE CRIED LA VALLIERE EAGERLY
THEIR MOMENTARY SILENCE SEEMED TO LAST AN AGE
LAST WEDNESDAY WAS THE DATE SAID THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER IN A SOFT AND POLISHED TONE OF VOICE TOUCHING THE LANDLORD ON THE SHOULDER
WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER THE PRINCE IS TO BE WHAT THE LATE KING WAS
BE CANDID AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SOME SAINT DESCENDED UPON THE EARTH WHY SO FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE MAKES YOU A PRESENT OF ANYTHING
SUCH OF HIS FRIENDS IN WHOM HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONFIDE HAD IN THEIR CHARACTER OF WITS RALLIED HIM UPON THE DUKE'S SUPERIORITY
WHAT HE SAID TO HIM THE FELLOW'S NAME ALONE SEEMED TO AFFECT YOU
AMONG ALL THESE LOVES A NOODLE WOULD MAKE HIS FORTUNE
MONSIEUR HAS BEEN BADLY ADVISED BY SOME ONE AND HE IS OF NERVOUS DISPOSITION HE MAY WELL BE SO WHEN YOU ARE CONCERNED SAID THE KING
THE PREOCCUPATION OF HIS MIND MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT THAT A MAN SO DEVOTED TO PLEASURE FOR WHOM INDEED PLEASURE MEANT EVERYTHING SHOULD OBEY SUCH A SUMMONS SO LISTLESSLY
DE MALICORNE YOUR KINDNESS AFFECTS ME MUCH MONSIEUR
YOU SPEAK OF THE DEAD
BUT SHE WILL NOT BE SO MUCH LONGER IF AS IT IS ASSERTED THE KING HAS CEASED TO TROUBLE HIS HEAD ABOUT HER
IT IS PROBABLE THE WIND MAY ABATE BEFORE SUNSET AND THE LANDING WILL NOT BE EFFECTED THEREFORE UNTIL THIS EVENING ALLOW ME TO OBSERVE MY LORD SAID BUCKINGHAM WITH AN IRRITATION OF MANNER WHICH HE DID NOT SEEK TO DISGUISE YOU DETAIN THESE LADIES AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO SO
I AM NOT ONE WHO IS WILLING TO DESTROY THE ILLUSIONS OF YOUTH
HE HAD A FORTNIGHT BEFORE EXTORTED FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE A HUNDRED PISTOLES ALL HE HAD TO ASSIST IN EQUIPPING HIM PROPERLY TO GO AND MEET MADAME ON HER ARRIVAL AT LE HAVRE
THIS COMPLIMENT HAD BEEN HONORED BY A TRANSLATION INTO ALL THE LANGUAGES OF EUROPE AND NUMEROUS VERSES IN LATIN AND FRENCH HAD BEEN CIRCULATED ON THE SUBJECT
I WISHED TO HAVE THE APPOINTMENT VERY MUCH FOR I KNEW WHAT IT COULD BE MADE TO PRODUCE
THE CENTER ONE IS ALONE WORTH A HUNDRED THOUSAND I THOUGHT SO SAID THE MARQUISE
ALL THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO HAVE KILLED NOT A SLIGHT AND DELICATE WOMAN BUT THE STRONGEST PORTER IN THE CHATEAU
I MYSELF CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT WHEN ONE HAS THE SOUL OF A KING,--YOUR OWN FOR INSTANCE SIRE DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY ON THE SUBJECT
IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD OF PAYING MADAME THE COMPLIMENTS SHE SO MUCH DESIRED AND RELISHED HIS MIND WAS FIXED UPON MAKING AS MUCH DISPLAY AS POSSIBLE OF HIS OWN GOOD FORTUNE
DE WARDES SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHOM THIS RECITAL HAD IMPRESSED MORE AND MORE AS HIS OWN RECOLLECTION REVIVED AS ATHOS SPOKE YOU SEE THAT MY CRIME DID NOT CAUSE THE DESTRUCTION OF ANY ONE'S SOUL AND THAT THE SOUL IN QUESTION MAY FAIRLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER LOST BEFORE MY REGRET
DE GUICHE IN HIS TURN EMBRACED BUCKINGHAM SOMEWHAT AGAINST HIS INCLINATION
SHE THOUGHT THE GOLD LIGHT AND THE STONES WRETCHED
I KNOW YOU TO BE A TERRIBLE TALKER AND TO-MORROW I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CONFIDENCE I HAVE SHOWN YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIRE THAT TO-MORROW EVERY ONE WILL KNOW THAT I HAVE DESIGNS UPON THIS LITTLE LA VALLIERE
ONE FROM ENGLAND AND THE OTHER FROM CALAIS
SO SO A NEW APPLICATION FOR FUNDS YES AND FROM THE KING'S OWN LIPS
AT THIS MOMENT A MAN CONCEALED IN A DRY DITCH PLANTED WITH YOUNG WILLOW SAPLINGS SCRAMBLED QUICKLY UP ITS SHELVING SIDE AND RAN OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHATEAU
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIT NIGHT
OF HER APPEARANCE OF HER MIND OF HERSELF IN FACT ASTOUNDED BY THIS QUESTION DE GUICHE HESITATED ANSWERING
COME SPEAK FREELY MONSIEUR
I WILL THINK IT OVER OH YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH
HE HUMBLED HIS MISTRESS BY DISDAINING HER
TRUE IT IS THAT THE YOUNG COUNTRY GIRL MIGHT ALLEGE AS HER EXCUSE THE AGITATION INTO WHICH THE KING SEEMED TO BE THROWN FOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN CLOSING THE DOOR HAD INVOLUNTARILY FIXED HER EYES UPON THE KING WHO AS HE RETIRED BACKWARDS HAD HIS FACE TOWARDS IT
DE GUICHE IS HERE HERE REPLIED THE KING FROWNING HERE
EVERY ONE AT FONTAINEBLEAU WAS AMAZED AT THE EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE WHICH MADAME HAD SO RAPIDLY ACQUIRED OVER THE KING AND WHISPERED AMONG THEMSELVES THAT MADAME WAS IN POINT OF FACT THE TRUE QUEEN
I AM THE MAN WHO IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE MONEY COME IN
I WILL SPEAK TO MONSIEUR ABOUT IT
THE KING HAS BEEN SAYING THE MOST TENDER THINGS ABOUT YOU
IT WAS THE DEPTH OF DISHONOR FOR A YOUNG SOVEREIGN FULL OF THE PRIDE HIS PERSONAL ADVANTAGES AND ROYAL POWER INSPIRED HIM WITH
IF YOU HAVE NO MORE IDEAS I HAVE THOUGH IT BEING NOW THE DINNER HOUR THE PRINCE SENT TO INFORM MADAME OF IT
AT THE SAME MOMENT AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HOW TO HOLD A NEEDLE EVERY ONE WHO COULD DISTINGUISH A COAT FROM A PAIR OF TROUSERS WAS SUMMONED TO THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WHO HAD RECEIVED INVITATIONS
BUT I WISH YOU TO SIT DOWN UPON THE WALL
ON THAT DAY YOU LEFT THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENTS WITH YOUR EYES FULL OF FURY
RAOUL SAID LOUISE
YES SHE SAID THE KING NEGLECTS ME THE KING DEVOTES HIMSELF TO PLEASURES AND AMUSEMENTS ONLY IN WHICH I HAVE NO SHARE PATIENCE PATIENCE MY DAUGHTER SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN SPANISH
NAY INDEED IT WAS I WHO PRESENTED HIM TO YOU AH I REMEMBER NOW--NOT A BAD-LOOKING FELLOW I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED HIM MONSEIGNEUR YES YES YES
THE KING AND MADAME DREW ASIDE TO ALLOW THE CARRIAGES THE OUTRIDERS AND RUNNERS TO PASS BY
IF ANY DISPROPORTION EXISTS IT IS ON THE COUNT'S SIDE OH
TELL ME MONSIEUR IS THE OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT A PERMANENT POSITION YOU SURPRISE ME MARCHIONESS FOR YOU SPEAK AS IF YOU HAD SOME MOTIVE OR INTEREST IN PUTTING THE QUESTION MY REASON IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
WITH AN ABSENT AIR HE KISSED HIS MOTHER'S HANDS AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN BEFORE RECEIVING HER PERMISSION TO DO SO
YES IT IS SO REPLIED SAINT-AIGNAN
YES SIRE REPEATED D'ARTAGNAN DELIGHTED ON HIS PART TO DIRECT THE KING'S ATTENTION TO RAOUL
HE WITHDREW ALMOST TOTTERING IN HIS GAIT AND NEARLY STUMBLED AGAINST THE MAINMAST OF THE SHIP
THE COACHMAN WAS TOLD TO STOP AND THE PERSONS WHO WERE INSIDE HAVING BEEN INFORMED OF THE ACCIDENT EAGERLY GAVE UP THEIR SEATS TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT YOUR KIND INDULGENCE FIRST OF ALL MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL TAKING HOLD OF HIS HAND
DECIDEDLY THOUGHT MANICAMP RANK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND ALL MEN ARE ALIKE THE PRINCE CONTINUED
BUT I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WHO OF HER OWN FREE WILL COULD EXPRESS HERSELF SO UNRESERVEDLY BENEATH THE ROYAL OAK WOULD ALLOW HERSELF TO BE INFLUENCED TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY THE DIRECTION OF OTHERS BUT THE THREAT HELD OUT AGAINST ME SIRE THREAT
AND IF I DARED OFFER AN OPINION TO YOUR MAJESTY WE OUGHT TO FOLLOW THEM THEY ARE FAR ENOUGH AWAY BY THIS TIME THEY WOULD QUICKLY ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE OVERTAKEN ESPECIALLY IF THEY KNEW WHO WERE FOLLOWING THEM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT COXCOMB THAT YOU ARE WHY ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO ME AND ANOTHER COMPARED YOU TO THE SUN THE GREATER REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT SHOW OURSELVES SAINT-AIGNAN
LISTEN AND YOU HOPE TO SUCCEED
I AM TIRED AND YOU WILL PERHAPS GIVE ME YOUR ARM HAD A THUNDERBOLT FALLEN AT THE FEET OF THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS TERRIFIED THAN BY HER COLD AND SEVERE TONE
FOUQUET ELISE FELT THE ALLUSION AND HER BLOOD SEEMED TO CONGEAL IN HER HEART
DE MAZARIN USED TO SAY
AND WHAT LA VALLIERE MIGHT HAVE SAID OF AND WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO RECALL ARE YOU SURE OF THAT PERFECTLY VERY WELL AN ADDITIONAL REASON
ENCOURAGED BY THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE WHICH HE HAD BEGUN TO INTRODUCE AT THE COURT AS AN ELEMENT OF EVERY RELATION OF LIFE LOUIS XIV
LITTLE OBSTINATE THING SAID MONTALAIS
HE DID NOT PASS ONE EULOGIUM AS IT WERE IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE RIGHT OF MAKING TWO REPROACHES
NOW IT IS SAID HE IS DEVOTED TO SOME OTHER PERSON
IS IT AGREED IT IS PASS ME THE PEN INK AND PAPER HERE THEY ARE THANK YOU MANICAMP RAISED HIMSELF WITH A SIGH AND LEANING ON HIS LEFT ELBOW IN HIS BEST HAND TRACED THE FOLLOWING LINES GOOD FOR AN ORDER FOR A PLACE OF MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME WHICH M
DE GUICHE ENTERTAINS ANYTHING OF THE SORT VERY GOOD YOU SEE MONSEIGNEUR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER TO HAVE LEFT ME IN MY RETIREMENT THAN TO HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO CONJURE UP BY AID OF ANY SCRUPLES I MAY HAVE HAD SUSPICIONS WHICH MADAME WILL REGARD AS CRIMES AND SHE WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT TOO WHAT WOULD YOU DO ACT REASONABLY IN WHAT WAY I SHOULD NOT PAY THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO THE SOCIETY OF THESE NEW EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHERS
BUT THESE WERE PERSONS WHO HAD NEITHER BEEN WITNESSES OF THE SCENE DURING THE SHOWER NOR HAD HEARD IT SPOKEN OF
TWO WORDS ONLY WHAT ARE THEY IN HASTE MALICORNE RETURNED THE RECOMMENDATION
EXCELLENT CRIED MONTALAIS
GRANTED
I CAN SEE WITH MY OWN EYES WELL AND WHAT DO YOU SEE THAT BUCKINGHAM NEVER QUITS MY WIFE
YES REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN I HAVE JUST LEFT HIM I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE PASSED A PORTION OF THE EVENING TOGETHER WE HAVE ARRANGED TO MEET AGAIN AS HE ANSWERED RAOUL HIS ABSENT LOOKS WERE DIRECTED ON ALL SIDES AS IF SEEKING SOME ONE IN THE CROWD OR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE ROOM
HE HAD NEVER BEHELD EYES SO BURNINGLY BRIGHT AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE ABOUT TO CLOSE NOR LOOKS SO TERRIBLE AT THE MOMENT THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE QUENCHED IN DEATH
KEEP YOUR TENTS AND HE THREW HIS ARMS ROUND RAOUL'S NECK
BUT WHERE SHALL WE SEE EACH OTHER AT THE KING'S PROMENADE IF YOU LIKE AGREED AND THEY SEPARATED
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT A MAN DOES NOT VERY READILY PLACE HIS HEART WHERE THERE IS NO HOPE OF RETURN AND THAT IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL HE SHOULD TAKE MEASURES OF SECURITY IN ADVANCE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID DE GUICHE WITH A SIGH
ON THE CONTRARY I REJOICE AT YOUR GOOD FORTUNE REJOICE
AND I ACQUIRED IN VERY EARLY LIFE THE HABIT OF SEEING MY DEAREST WISHES DISAPPOINTED DO YOU SPEAK TRULY SAID THE KING
YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT TO THROW ONE'S SELF INTO THE WATER FOR INSTANCE WITH A FRIEND AT THE SAME HEADLONG RATE AS HE HIMSELF WOULD DO IT WOULD BE THE ACT EITHER OF A FOOL OR A MADMAN
BUT ADDED ANNE OF AUSTRIA DO YOU NOT KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT IF THE KING WERE TO WIN THE BRACELETS HE WOULD NOT RESTORE THEM TO ME YOU MEAN HE WOULD GIVE THEM TO THE QUEEN NO
THE BREAKFAST AT MONSIEUR DE BAISEMEAUX'S
ONE EVENING PARTICULARLY YOU MAY REMEMBER MY LORD THE KING REFUSED TO DANCE WITH HER BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HER PLAIN AND BADLY DRESSED THESE WORDS MADE THE DUKE OF ORLEANS FROWN
HE EMPLOYED A MODE OF PROCEEDING UPON WHICH HE PRESERVED THE MOST PROFOUND SECRECY AND WHICH CONSISTED IN ADVANCING TO HIMSELF FROM THE COFFERS OF THE SYNDIC HALF A DOZEN YEAR'S PROFITS THAT IS TO SAY FIFTEEN THOUSAND LIVRES SWEARING TO HIMSELF--OBSERVE QUITE TO HIMSELF--TO REPAY THIS DEFICIENCY AS SOON AS AN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD PRESENT ITSELF
HE WENT TO THE STABLES WHERE HE WAS INFORMED BY A GROOM THAT THERE WERE NO CARRIAGES OF ANY DESCRIPTION
WAIT FOR HIM
DO NOT FEAR SHE WILL EVER CONTRADICT YOU WHEN YOU TELL HER YOU LOVE HER SAID MADAME LAUGHING
MALICORNE WE KNOW HAD MADE THE JOURNEY TO ORLEANS IN SEARCH OF THE BREVET DESTINED FOR MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HAD PRODUCED SUCH A STRONG FEELING AT THE CASTLE OF BLOIS
THIS UNHAPPY MAN SAID M
IN THE MEANTIME LEARNING FROM MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE THAT IT WAS LIKELY YOU WOULD BE IN THIS DIRECTION I CAME HERE AND AM HAPPY TO FIND YOU BOTH AND BOTH OF US VERY SAD AS YOU SEE SAID MONTALAIS GOING TO LOUISE'S ASSISTANCE WHOSE COUNTENANCE WAS VISIBLY ALTERED
THE CHEVALIER ASSUMED ALMOST AN ANGRY AIR AS HE REPLIED MONSEIGNEUR YOU ARE SUBJECTING ME TO CROSS-EXAMINATION
THAT IS TRUE
BUT I DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE READ ALL NOT READ ALL DO YOU SAY NO
IT WOULD SEEM THAT I DID NOT INSULT M
BUT SET TO WORK WITHOUT DELAY OH
CHAPTER VI
GOOD CRIED SHE FURIOUS
SET OFF AT ONCE AND IN THE FIRST LETTER I WRITE TO ENGLAND I WILL CLAIM YOU IN THE KING'S NAME AND MADAME ROSE TO PLACE HER LETTER IN BRAGELONNE'S HANDS
IN ORDER TO SPARE YOUR TEARS AM I TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES
THERE IS SOME MISTAKE HERE SAID MALICORNE TO HIMSELF
BUT DO NOT EVER SAY DO NOT EVER THINK THAT I HAVE JESTED WITH OR DECEIVED YOU
A MAN'S HEART IS A VERY PRECIOUS GIFT MINE PARTICULARLY IS VERY TENDER AND IN THAT LIGHT I PRESENT IT TO YOU OH
FOR YOU ARE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT BREAKFAST WAS ANNOUNCED ASSUREDLY MY DEAR GOVERNOR AND THEY PASSED INTO THE DINING-ROOM
ESPECIALLY TOO WHEN THE WOMAN IN QUESTION IS ONE WITH WHOM THE KING IS IN LOVE BUT THE KING WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH LA VALLIERE A WEEK AGO
HE WAS ENJOYING THE PLEASURE OF ALL THESE COMPLIMENTS
THE BARON DE WOSTPUR
WOMEN LIKE MEN HAVE A FALSE DELICACY AT TIMES
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WHO HAD NO OCCASION TO SPECULATE ABOUT ANYTHING INASMUCH AS HE KNEW ALL ATE HIS BREAKFAST WITH THAT EXTRAORDINARY APPETITE WHICH THE TROUBLES OF ONE'S FRIENDS BUT STIMULATES AND ENJOYED AT THE SAME TIME BOTH MONSIEUR'S ILL-HUMOR AND THE VEXATION OF MANICAMP
THE PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN I ADMIT BUT YOU WILL PERHAPS HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ACCOMPANY ME TO MY APARTMENTS WHICH ARE ON THE STAIRCASE AT THE END OF THIS GALLERY I FOLLOW YOU MONSIEUR SAID DE WARDES
RAOUL LOST NO TIME ON THE ROAD AND IN SIXTEEN HOURS HE ARRIVED AT BLOIS
I MUST SUBMIT
OH I WILL NOT REFUSE TO WITNESS A RESOUNDING OATH SAID MADAME
HE WISHED TO SPEAK TO THE DIFFERENT PERSONS THERE BUT IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS ABSENT
THIS IS A STRIKING ONE AND IF YOU WERE TO SEE HIM YOU WOULD ADMIT IT TO BE SO IF I WERE TO SEE HIM INDEED SAID ARAMIS IN AN INDIFFERENT TONE
THE PROCESSION WAS MET AT NANTERRE BY A BRILLIANT ESCORT OF CAVALIERS AND CARRIAGES
BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT I SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN TO HATE M
COME DE GUICHE YOU ARE INNOCENT AND BEING SO THE SCENE OF TO-DAY MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
MONSIEUR SAID THE KING ADDRESSING RAOUL I HAVE ASKED MONSIEUR LE PRINCE TO BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU UP TO ME
AND HAVING FOUND MINE I WAS SEARCHING FOR YOURS SIRE WHEN I HAD THE HAPPINESS TO MEET YOUR MAJESTY VERY WELL
IF NOT I SHALL BEGIN TO THINK THAT IN ORDER TO CHANGE YOU FOREVER NOTHING MORE WAS NEEDED THAN A SINGLE STEP IN THE PALACE A SINGLE BREATH OF FAVOR A SMILE FROM THE QUEEN A LOOK FROM THE KING RAOUL HAD NO SOONER PRONOUNCED THIS LATTER WORD THAN LA VALLIERE BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH NO DOUBT FROM FEAR AT SEEING THE YOUNG MAN EXCITE HIMSELF
ACCEPT ACCEPT WHISPERED ARAMIS EAGERLY
I HOPE BECAUSE HOPE EXISTS IN MAN AND NEVER ABANDONS HIM UNTIL DEATH BUT ADMITTING THAT YOU OBTAIN THE HAPPINESS YOU COVET EVEN THEN YOU ARE MORE CERTAINLY LOST THAN IF YOU HAD FAILED IN OBTAINING IT I BESEECH YOU RAOUL NOT TO INTERRUPT ME ANY MORE
DE SAINT-AIGNAN A MERE JEST TOO
AND WOULD NOT THAT A PARTICLE OF IT SHOULD BE LOST IN THE WAY
THE LETTER HAS A GOOD NAME ATTACHED TO IT AND THAT IS ALL I CAN TELL YOU
AND THE SECOND THAT HE OUGHT NOT TO WALK IN THE SAME LINE WITH THEM
I VISIT YOU BUT I LEAVE MY HEART ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL DID NOT YOUR SMILE INDICATE THAT YOUR HIGHNESS IS GIFTED WITH THE POWER OF READING THE INMOST DEPTHS OF THE SOUL AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THEREFORE WHY AT PRESENT ANY PROLONGED RESIDENCE AT THE COURT OF ENGLAND WOULD BE A MATTER OF THE DEEPEST REGRET AND I NEED NOT INQUIRE IF SO GALLANT A KNIGHT IS RECOMPENSED IN RETURN I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP MADAME WITH HER WHOM I LOVE AND I BELIEVE OUR AFFECTION IS MUTUAL IN THAT CASE DO NOT DELAY YOUR DEPARTURE MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE AND DELAY NOT YOUR RETURN FOR ON YOUR RETURN WE SHALL SEE TWO PERSONS HAPPY
HAVING OBSERVED THE DRAWING-ROOM SO PERFECTLY ARRANGED THAT IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID HER PRESENCE THERE HAD DRIVEN AWAY THE FAIRIES WHO WERE ITS OCCUPANTS SHE ASKED HERSELF IF THE GLANCE OR GAZE OF THOSE WHOM SHE HAD DISPLACED--WHETHER SPIRITS FAIRIES ELVES OR HUMAN CREATURES--HAD NOT ALREADY RECOGNIZED HER
I CANNOT EXPOSE MYSELF TO AN AFFRONT
WELL I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU ALTHOUGH IT IS PROHIBITED TO COMMUNICATE THE REGISTERS TO STRANGERS
TO SECURE SUCCESS IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SOME STEPS SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY TAKEN AND IT WAS NECESSARY ALSO THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOULD COMPREHEND THE SERIOUS POSITION IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED IN ORDER TO YIELD COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENEROUS FANCIES OF A WOMAN
WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME TO MONSIEUR MOST CERTAINLY IF I MAY BE PERMITTED THE HONOR HAVE YOU YOUR CARRIAGE NO
WE ARE SOLE MASTERS OF THE SITUATION NO NO MY DEAR GOVERNOR
IS IT POSSIBLE SAID THE KING WITH SOME ANXIETY THAT YOU HAVE PERCEIVED IT THEN FROM HER CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU
FLAME NOT BLOOD COURSES THROUGH MY VEINS
IT IS NOT THE PRIVILEGE OF ALL EYES TO GAZE UPON THE SUN
I AM THE QUEEN
FOUQUET'S CASE WHEN HE HAD TWO WEALTHY AND CLEVER FRIENDS WHO AMASSED MONEY FOR HIM AND WRUNG IT FROM EVERY POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE SOURCE
THE VALET USUALLY IN ATTENDANCE APPEARED
AND SUCH OTHER AS THEY ARE ENABLED TO ENLIST FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAVE NO FEAR OF SEA-SICKNESS AND THERE IS A FAIR SPRINKLING TO BE MET WITH AT SARZEAU AND VANNES I BELIEVE YOUR EMINENCE YES
OUGHT WE NOT SIRE TO HAVE THE PORTRAITS OF THE SHEPHERDESSES THE KING WHO EXPECTED THIS DETERMINED PERSEVERANCE AND WHO BEGAN TO FEEL SOME UNEASINESS DID NOT THINK IT SAFE TO PROVOKE SO DANGEROUS AN INTERROGATOR
WOMEN CAN NEVER ESCAPE SLANDER REPLIED THE MARQUISE AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THEN I FANCY I DO TELL US THEN BEND YOUR HEAD DOWN TOWARDS ME WHAT
FOR YOU SPEAK OF YOUR DEPARTURE WITH TRANQUILLITY I WAS NOT BORN FOR HAPPINESS SIRE REPLIED THE PRINCESS DEJECTEDLY
CERTAIN REASONS WHICH YOU WILL UNDERSTAND BY AND BY OBLIGE ME TO TAKE AT MY OWN COST THIS SMALL ROOM ONLY YES YES SAID THE HOST
THAT WAS FLATTERING ENOUGH THE KING DOES NOT PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FLATTERIES MADAME THE KING IS JUST AS MUCH ADONIS AS APOLLO
WELL I CAN TELL YOU THAT M
GREAT NUMBERS OF THE INHABITANTS OF LE HAVRE HAVING EMBARKED IN FISHING-COBLES AND BOATS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION SET OFF TO MEET THE ROYAL BARGE
ARAMIS EXPLAINED WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS THAT A WISH TO SPEAK TO M
CHAPTER LII
BUT FOR WHAT IS DUE TO ME MONSIEUR GRISART IT IS TOO LITTLE AND I HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND MORE
AS FOR LOUIS HE WENT TO SEEK HIS MOTHER FOR HE FELT THAT HE HAD NEED OF A MORE COMPLETE ABSOLUTION THAN THAT HE HAD JUST RECEIVED FROM HIS BROTHER
HE MUST BE WORTH SEEING THEN FORBIDDEN FRUIT MY LORD
ALL WOMEN WERE PASSIONATELY LOVED BY HIM EVEN THE QUEEN HIS WIFE
THEY ARE VASSALS OF THE VICOMTE DE MELUN
LONG STUDY IS NEEDED FOR SUCH CONVERSATIONS WHICH WITHOUT A LOOK GESTURE OR MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD SEEM LIKE THE CONVERSATION OF A GROUP OF STATUES
OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER WITHOUT ALLUDING TO HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
THE KING ADVANCED IN THE FIRST PLACE TOWARDS THE QUEENS TO WHOM HE BOWED WITH AN AIR FULL OF GRACEFUL RESPECT
THE YOUNG QUEEN ALTHOUGH SPANISH BY BIRTH AND THE NIECE OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA LOVED THE KING AND COULD NOT CONCEAL HER AFFECTION
ALL THE TIME HE PASSED WITH HIS MOTHER HE EMPLOYED IN ADMIRING HER ARMS IN GIVING HIS OPINION UPON HER COSMETICS AND RECIPES FOR COMPOUNDING ESSENCES IN WHICH SHE WAS VERY PARTICULAR
DO NOT MAKE ME BITTERLY REGRET HAVING LISTENED TO A FEELING STRONGER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS THE SECOND TIME YOU HAVE SAID SO RAOUL
HE KNEW THAT THE TIME HAD PASSED AWAY FOR GRANDS COUPS ENTRE GENTILSHOMMES
NOT IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS I SHOULD THINK FOR I JUST NOW MET MADAME AS SHE WAS ENTERING BY THE SMALL STAIRCASE
EIGHT OF THESE BASKETS PLACED SIDE BY SIDE FILLED THE SHIP'S HOLD
IT WAS D'ARTAGNAN HIS CLOTHES DUSTY HIS FACE INFLAMED HIS HAIR DRIPPING WITH SWEAT HIS LEGS STIFF
VERY LIKELY SAID THE KING
MONTALAIS WAS SEEN OR RATHER NOT WAS NOT SEEN TO GLIDE STEALTHILY OUT OF THE ROOM APPROPRIATED TO THE MAIDS OF HONOR LEADING LA VALLIERE AFTER HER WHO TRIED TO CONCEAL HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND BOTH OF THEM HURRYING SECRETLY THROUGH THE GARDENS SUCCEEDED LOOKING ROUND THEM AT EVERY STEP THEY TOOK IN REACHING THE THICKET
THE KING WAS COMPLETELY BEWILDERED BY IT
BUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WITHOUT UTTERLY CONDEMNING MYSELF I DECLARE IT TO BE SUPERIOR TO THE NON-COMPLEX COQUETRY OF MONTALAIS AND THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS BEGAN TO LAUGH
AND BY THE RUE DE LYON TO LOOK UPON AND TO ENJOY THE CALM OF THE COUNTRY
BUT THOSE FRIENDS ARE DEAD MONEY DOES NOT DIE MARGUERITE
SURELY THAT NEVER SERIOUSLY OCCURRED TO YOU INDEED IT DID
AND SO SHE SAID YOU JUDGE ME AS YOU HAVE SAID DE GUICHE GREW PALE TURNED HIS HEAD ASIDE AND WAS SILENT
AND IF I WERE THE KING I WOULD REQUIRE YOU IMMEDIATELY TO TELL US WHAT THE DELIGHTFUL THINGS ARE THESE DRYADS HAVE BEEN SAYING SINCE YOU ALONE SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I AM AT HIS MAJESTY'S ORDERS MADAME IN THAT RESPECT REPLIED THE COMTE QUICKLY
JUST IMAGINE LA VALLIERE HAD FALLEN BACK FAINTING AND WELL
WHO CAN SIT ON THE THRONE OF FRANCE
IT WAS MONSIEUR WHO ADVANCED TOWARDS THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
YOURS IS A NEW THEORY THEN
AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT INVITED ME CONTINUED THE KING
GIVE THEM TO ME AN INSTANT WHAT THE DEVIL
NO HUMAN POWER COULD RESIST THAT FEROCIOUS ARDOR
MONTALAIS CALLED OUT AT THE NOISE MADE BY THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND RECOGNIZING THE KING MADE HER ESCAPE
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED AS I OWE HIM MANY PERSONAL OBLIGATIONS TO SETTLE THEM WITH YOU BY CROSSING MY SWORD WITH YOURS AT THE SAME MOMENT BUCKINGHAM DREW HIS SWORD FROM ITS SCABBARD SALUTED RAOUL AND PUT HIMSELF ON GUARD
HE HAD BEEN LOOKED FOR TO NO PURPOSE AMONG THOSE PRESENT
DE SAINT-AIGNAN TELL YOU MALICORNE TELL ME
BUT TO MATCH ONE'S SELF WITH WOMEN TO BE ATTACKED BY THEM TO HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UPON BY MERE GIRLS FROM THE COUNTRY WHO HAD COME FROM BLOIS EXPRESSLY FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE GOLDSMITH AS HE ENTERED FOUND HER THUS OCCUPIED
HERE IS YOUR COMMISSION OF CAPTAIN OF MUSKETEERS
GET CURED MY LORD AND HE WILL HOLD QUITE ANOTHER LANGUAGE TO YOU BUT M
YES SAID BAISEMEAUX GREATLY DISTURBED BY THE GLANCE WHICH THE PRELATE FIXED UPON HIM,--"AT M
HE WOULD RESIST AND IF ANY VOICE IN THE WORLD COULD OVERCOME HIS RESISTANCE IT WOULD BE THE VOICE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
IT IS LIKE YOU TO SPEAK TO ME IN THIS MANNER AND I THANK YOU FOR IT IT WAS ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF WILD DREAMERS SUCH AS I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED THAT I SPOKE
THE WINDOW OF ONE OF THE HOUSES LOOKING ON THE SQUARE WAS OPENED TOO THE CASEMENT OF THE HOUSE WHERE BUCKINGHAM RESIDED
TWO SHEPHERDS FULL OF CURIOSITY EVEN INDISCREETLY SO HAVE ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE MYSTIFIED IN A MOST AMUSING MANNER BY THREE NYMPHS OR THREE SHEPHERDESSES,'--I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER IF IT WAS NYMPHS OR SHEPHERDESSES SHE SAID
MONSIEUR WILL NEVER LOVE ANY WOMAN SHE SAID
AND I ASSURE YOU MONSIEUR FOUQUET THAT IN NO WAY HAS HE CHECKED THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY FOUQUET BOWED BUT DID NOT REPLY
PHILIP WAS AS WEAK AS A WOMAN AND BEGAN TO CRY OUT EVERY ONE BETRAYS ME,--NO ONE CARES FOR ME
FOUQUET IS INEVITABLE
AND EVERY SENTIMENT WHICH WOULD SEPARATE YOUR MAJESTY FROM THE QUEEN IN LEADING YOU TO TAKE NOTICE OF ME WILL BE A SOURCE OF PROFOUNDEST SORROW FOR THE QUEEN THE KING ENDEAVORED TO INTERRUPT THE YOUNG GIRL BUT SHE CONTINUED WITH A SUPPLIANT GESTURE
BUT LOVE IS LOVE
AN HOUR AFTERWARDS ANNE OF AUSTRIA RECEIVED A VISIT FROM MADAME WHOM SHE COVERED WITH CARESSES SAYING EXCELLENT NEWS
THE MUSIC HAUTBOYS FLUTES AND VIOLS WAS DELIGHTFULLY DESCRIPTIVE OF RURAL DELIGHTS
THE NAME THAT WAS PRONOUNCED INSTEAD OF THE NAME WHICH THE MARQUISE AWAITED HAD PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT UPON HER AS THE BADLY SHARPENED AXES THAT HAD HACKED WITHOUT DESTROYING MESSIEURS DE CHALAIS AND DE THOU UPON THE SCAFFOLD
WE WILL MAKE UP THE DEFICIENCY
DEUCE TAKE IT
BY AN EXCELLENT SERVANT OF MINE CAN YOU RELY ON HIM HE IS A MAN WHO HAS BEEN WITH ME ALL MY LIFE VERY WELL
D'ARTAGNAN EXCLAIMED MANY VOICES WITH ANIMATION
IT MAY BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE NO SELF-RESPECT AT ALL BUT TO HAVE TOO LITTLE IS NOT ENOUGH AS THE SAYING IS COMTE
WELL SAID HE
THE KING ARRIVED
REALLY COUNT YOU TREAT ME VERY ILL TO-DAY REPLIED THE CHEVALIER
OH NO WILL YOU ALLOW ME M
DE WARDES SAID BUCKINGHAM ONE FINAL WORD
ANNE OF AUSTRIA WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL
RETARDED ALSO BY THE LAMENESS OF HER FOOT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE CALLED OUT TO HER COMPANIONS TO HALT AND LEFT BEHIND SHE OBLIGED THEM BOTH TO WAIT FOR HER
THEY MADE HER SIT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ROOMS OF THE GROUND FLOOR
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SEEN
A MOMENT IF YOU PLEASE MY LORD
IN ANY WAY YOU CHOSE MONSIEUR REPLIED DE BRAGELONNE COLDLY
BUT UPON THE RUE DE LYON THERE WERE TWO RANGES OF BUILDINGS DIVIDED BY COURTYARDS WHICH COMPRISED SETS OF APARTMENTS FOR THE RECEPTION OF ALL CLASSES OF TRAVELERS WHETHER ON FOOT OR ON HORSEBACK OR EVEN WITH THEIR OWN CARRIAGES
THE KING SOMEWHAT JEALOUS OF THAT MATERNAL SOLICITUDE WHICH WAS BESTOWED PARTICULARLY ON HIS BROTHER FELT DISPOSED TO SHOW TOWARDS ANNE OF AUSTRIA MORE SUBMISSION AND ATTACHMENT THAN HIS CHARACTER REALLY DICTATED
SPEAK SAINT-AIGNAN FAITHFUL TO HIS CHARACTER OF BEING DEAF BLIND AND DUMB HAD STATIONED HIMSELF IN A CORNER OF THE DOOR UPON A STOOL WHICH BY CHANCE HE FOUND THERE
SELL THEM SEPARATELY SELL THE STONES ONLY IN THAT WAY IT IS EASY
HE SHOWED HIS ADMIRATION IN SO MARKED A MANNER THAT THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AS HE LISTENED TO HIS COMPLIMENTS WHILE BUCKINGHAM AND DE GUICHE WERE ALMOST HEART-BROKEN
HIS MAJESTY HE SAID HAS BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT THE COMTE DE LA FERE IS HIGH IN FAVOR WITH KING CHARLES II
ANNE OF AUSTRIA AFTER HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HAD LEFT HER SAID TO HERSELF AS SHE EXAMINED THE BRACELETS THEY ARE INDEED PRECIOUS
EXCEPT YOU MADAME SAID MONSIEUR
BUT ALL THESE DETAILS HARDLY APPLY
VERY GOOD
VERY GOOD
I AM UNWORTHY OF YOUR REGARD DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IN SPEAKING AS YOU HAVE DONE YOU CHANGE MY ESTEEM FOR YOU INTO THE PROFOUNDEST ADMIRATION SIRE YOU ASSUME MY WORDS TO BE CONTRARY TO THE TRUTH
POLITICS ARE POLITICS AS M
FOR IN FACT THE INJURY IN QUESTION IS A VERY HARD RETURN FOR A LITTLE HARMLESS CURIOSITY THAT IS AS MUCH TO SAY THEN THAT THE STORY OF MY NAIAD HAS DISPLEASED THE KING ASKED MADAME INNOCENTLY
IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO TREAT MADAME AS A FRIEND
NOW RAOUL SAID DE GUICHE THERE HE IS
DO YOU OBSERVE FOR YOURSELF SIRE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM RIGHT I WILL OBSERVE
LETTERS OF NOBILITY IT IS TRUE ARE PURCHASABLE
A HUSBAND WHO IS THE CAUSE OF HIS WIFE'S EYES GETTING RED IS AN ODIOUS CREATURE
YOU KNOW MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE THAT THE KING IS TO APPEAR AS SPRING IT WILL BE ADMIRABLE SAID DE GUICHE
I WILL CHOOSE A WIFE FOR HIM HE HAS ALREADY CHOSEN ONE SIRE AND ONLY AWAITS YOUR CONSENT IT IS ONLY A QUESTION THEN OF SIGNING THE MARRIAGE-CONTRACT ATHOS BOWED
LOOK AT MY SWORD A SPANISH BLADE THE ONE I WORE AT LA ROCHELLE
IT IS PLAIN THE PLAN WAS FORMED BY A CLEAR HEAD
WHY DO YOU ASK SHE INQUIRED
MANICAMP DE GUICHE SET OFF ON HORSEBACK AS HARD AS HE COULD I FOLLOWING HIM AT A SLOWER PACE
I BEG YOUR PARDON I MEAN MADEMOISELLE AURE DE MONTALAIS PRECISELY AS YOU HAVE STATED MADAME ARTICULATED MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS VERY DISTINCTLY
IF YOU DO NOT IMMEDIATELY GIVE ME SATISFACTION I WILL AVAIL MYSELF OF EVERY MEANS TO REVENGE MYSELF INDEED MONSIEUR SAID BUCKINGHAM SUDDENLY APPEARING UPON THE SCENE OF ACTION THAT IS A THREAT WHICH SAVORS OF ASSASSINATION AND THEREFORE ILL BECOMES A GENTLEMAN WHAT DID YOU SAY MY LORD SAID DE WARDES TURNING ROUND TOWARDS HIM
I LOOK FOR AND INQUIRE AFTER DE GUICHE EVERYWHERE BUT NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM NO ONE IN THE TOWN HAS SPOKEN TO HIM
FORGIVE ME BUT MAY I INQUIRE THE NAME OF THE PROTECTOR YOU SPEAK OF
I NEED ONLY MENTION THAT I HAVE MATTERS OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO COMMUNICATE TO THE GOVERNOR THAT I CAN ONLY RELY BEFOREHAND UPON ONE THING THAT M
HE THEN DIRECTED HIS BODY TO BE ANOINTED WITH PERFUMED OILS IN THE MANNER OF THE WRESTLERS OF OLD
HE LOOKED SOMEWHAT ANXIOUS
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
NO NO
LET ME COMFORT YOU
BUT I AM IN THE HUMOR TO PROVE MYSELF DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASED IN MY TURN MONSEIGNEUR BAH SO I WILL NOT RETURN TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS EXCEPT UPON ONE CONDITION NAME IT I WANT TO OBLIGE THE FRIEND OF ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHAT'S HIS NAME MALICORNE AN UGLY NAME BUT VERY WELL BORNE MONSEIGNEUR THAT MAY BE
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE LOOKED ON ALSO WITH ONE OF THOSE LOOKS OF FIXED HOSTILITY THAT SEEMED TO GIVE TO A MAN'S GLANCE THE POWER OF A LEVER WHEN IT RAISES AN OBSTACLE WRESTS IT AWAY AND CASTS IT TO A DISTANCE
HIS ENTRANCE PRODUCED THEREFORE THE MOST BRILLIANT EFFECT
WHENEVER THE BOUQUET OF THE ONE IS ALWAYS THE SAME COLOR AS THE RIBBONS OF THE OTHER
YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME THEN SHE SAID TO THE KING WHO STILL REMAINED SILENT WHILE POOR LA VALLIERE'S FEATURES BECAME VISIBLY CHANGED AT HIS CONTINUED SILENCE
SO GO AT ONCE MONSIEUR MANICAMP A THOUSAND THANKS
THE MOST INTIMATE AMONG THE COURTIERS APPROACHED ONE BY ONE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMIRING MORE CLOSELY THE BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WHICH SOON WITH THE KING'S PERMISSION WAS HANDED ABOUT FROM PERSON TO PERSON
LOOK AT ME
SUDDENLY THE COMTE DE SAINT-AIGNAN WAS OBSERVED ENDEAVORING TO APPROACH EITHER THE KING OR MADAME
PUT UP YOUR SWORD SAID RAOUL
THIS STRANGER WAS THE BISHOP OF VANNES
THE KING HAVING OBSERVED ALL THESE THINGS AND CONTEMPLATED THE MAGNIFICENT PICTURE BEFORE HIM GAVE THE ORDER WHICH DE VILLEROY AND DE SAINT-AIGNAN AWAITED
A CASE WHICH MUST BE TREATED WITH SOOTHING APPLICATION
I SHALL BE UNABLE THEREFORE TO PROLONG MY RESIDENCE AS YOUR HIGHNESS HAS SO KINDLY INVITED ME TO DO WHEN DO YOU LEAVE INQUIRED PHILIP WITH AN EXPRESSION FULL OF INTEREST
MADAME CAST DOWN HER EYES AND WAS SILENT
WHEN THE KING MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE THEATER WAS FULL AND PRESENTED TO THE VIEW ONE VAST GROUP DAZZLING WITH GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES
HER HEART SPOKE AND MURMURED THE NAME OF DE GUICHE
AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO DECLARE THAT SUCH IS THE CASE DO YOU ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO IT GUICHE INQUIRED THE PRINCE
THE QUEEN TURNED PALE AND PRESSED HER CLENCHED HANDS UPON HER BOSOM
THE STREET ITSELF WAS COMPOSED OF TWO HOUSES OCCUPIED BY PERSONS OF THE CLASS OF TRADESPEOPLE THE HOUSES BEING SEPARATED BY TWO LARGE GARDENS BORDERED WITH HEDGES RUNNING ROUND THEM
DO YOU MEAN TO RIDICULE ME MONSIEUR INQUIRED BUCKINGHAM
I AM AWARE OF IT YOU KNOW IT EXCLAIMED FOUQUET IN A TONE OF SURPRISE
IN THE COURTYARDS WHERE THE GRASS HAD FORMERLY BEEN ALLOWED TO LUXURIATE AS IF THE UNGRATEFUL MAZARIN HAD THOUGHT IT A GOOD IDEA TO LET THE PARISIANS PERCEIVE THE SOLITUDE AND DISORDER WERE WITH MISERY AND DESPAIR THE FIT ACCOMPANIMENTS OF FALLEN MONARCHY
OF SON ALTESSE ROYALE MADAME HENRIETTA STAMMERED OUT THE OLD LADY
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HOWEVER THE INTENDANT ADDED THAT WITHOUT ANTICIPATING M
HE HELD LA VALLIERE'S ARM WITHIN HIS OWN AND HELD HER HAND IN HIS
WE WANT TWO PLACES IN YOUR BOAT AND WRAPPING FIVE OR SIX PISTOLES IN PAPER HE THREW THEM FROM THE QUAY INTO THE BOAT
WHOEVER LOVES AND IS BELOVED BY HIM HAS INDEED FOUND HAPPINESS SAINT-AIGNAN HERE PAUSED
THE KING DOES NOT INTEND TO ARREST THE PERSON IN QUESTION
AND NOW LET US GIVE NO CAUSE FOR SUSPICION
THE ELEMENTS SUBALTERN POWERS OF MYTHOLOGY TOGETHER WITH THEIR ATTRIBUTES HASTENED TO FOLLOW THEIR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN
THE WHOLE SCENE WAS A PERFECT ENIGMA FOR RAOUL THE KEY TO WHICH HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING TO OBTAIN
YES WHICH MEANS MURMURED DE GUICHE
OH MONSIEUR EVERY ONE IS ALWAYS WELL LODGED WHEN HE IS FREE AT ALL EVENTS SINCE YOU YOURSELF ADMIT YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT WRITE THAT UNHAPPY DISTICH BUT WITHOUT ANY INTENTION I SWEAR
IF MADAME HAD BEEN ABOUT TO LEAVE HER APARTMENTS WITH THAT STRANGENESS OF MANNER HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED HER
BECAUSE MOST ANXIOUSLY DESIROUS OF OBTAINING THE INTERVIEW YOU HAVE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO GRANT ME I EMPLOYED THE MEANS WHICH APPEARED TO ME MOST CERTAIN TO INSURE IT
DO YOU KNOW WHY I SUMMONED YOU SAID THE KING AS HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW SO AS NOT TO LOSE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE PASSING IN THE GARDENS WHICH FRONTED THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO MADAME'S PAVILION
TO-MORROW AT DAYBREAK I SHALL BE ON MY HORSE AGAIN YOU CANNOT RETURN TO YOUR HOTEL ALONE
DE WARDES SMILED AS HE SAW HIM WITHDRAW
I SAID MONSIEUR THAT THE WORDS YOU HAVE JUST SPOKEN ARE DISPLEASING TO MY ENGLISH EARS VERY WELL MONSIEUR IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE EXCLAIMED DE WARDES THOROUGHLY INCENSED I AT LEAST FIND IN YOU ONE WHO WILL NOT ESCAPE ME
BUT I HAVE KEPT THE NATURE OF THE ACCUSATION A PERFECT SECRET
WHICH IN SPITE OF THEIR ELEVATION ARE SHELTERED FROM SUCH GIDDINESS
YOU ARE NOT AFRAID ARE YOU THAT I SHALL SAY TOO MUCH TO HER IT WOULD BE FOR MY SAKE THE TREATY IS AGREED TO THEN NOT ONLY SO BUT SIGNED
IS IT THUS YOU BLASPHEME THE MOST SACRED OF NAMES WHAT NAMES MONSIEUR
DE GUICHE OR M I PREFER NO ONE
COME WE ONLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
DE MONTESPAN HAS TO EXPECT CERTAINLY
HOW I SHALL BE ENNUYEE HOW QUICKLY I SHALL DIE DO YOU WISH TO COME TO PARIS LOUISE BREATHED ANOTHER SIGH
AM I NOT RIGHT I DO NOT SAY NO MADAME WHOM DO YOU WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT
YOU ARE VERY FORTUNATE MONTALAIS THAT IS TO SAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE IN MY PLACE LOUISE WAS SILENT
BUT ALL THIS TIME YOU ARE THINKING ONLY OF YOUR VERY HAPPY FIFTEEN-FRANC PRISONER AND YOU FORGET POOR SELDON MY PROTEGE WELL OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR YOU IT SHALL BE A GALA DAY FOR HIM
WE WOULD NOT WISH TO SAY HOWEVER THAT THE WILY COURTIER HAD NOT KNOW BEFOREHAND THAT THE BEAUTIFUL ATHENAIS WAS TO WEAR THAT PARTICULAR COLOR
TREASON THEN--DEEP MENACES CONCEALED UNDER THE SEMBLANCE OF PUBLIC INTEREST--SUCH WERE COLBERT'S MANEUVERS
LOUISE WAS WEEPING HER EYES OUT
LEFT TO HIMSELF THE FRANCISCAN DREW FROM HIS POCKET A BUNDLE OF PAPERS SOME OF WHICH HE READ OVER WITH THE MOST CAREFUL ATTENTION
MALICORNE HAD ASKED MANICAMP TO ASK A BREVET OF MAID OF HONOR OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE
AND IN FACT THE FOLLOWING WORDS PRONOUNCED BY A GENTLE AND MELANCHOLY VOICE FLOATED TOWARDS THEM
WHAT IS THE MATTER PHILIP INQUIRED ANNE OF AUSTRIA TURNING TOWARDS HER SON
BUT WHO TOLD YOU THAT MONSIEUR WAS JEALOUS MY MOTHER REPRESENTED TO ME THAT MONSIEUR ENTERED HER APARTMENTS LIKE A MADMAN THAT HE UTTERED A THOUSAND COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOU AND--FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING IT--AGAINST YOUR COQUETRY
OF ALL YOUR MAIDS OF HONOR YOU HAVE REALLY SELECTED FOR ME THE ONE MOST FULL OF DEFECTS STILL SHE IS ONE OF MY MAIDS OF HONOR OF COURSE
FOUQUET BOWED WITH A SMILE TO HIM WHO AN HOUR BEFORE WAS BRINGING HIM RUIN AND DEATH
A KING'S WORD GIVEN MUST BE KEPT AND THE KING GOING STRAIGHT TO HIS TABLE OPENED A DRAWER AND TOOK OUT A FOLDED PAPER
BUT MALICORNE HAD LEFT HIS WINDOW AND WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS TO HIS FRIEND'S ASSISTANCE
AND AS GUICHE HESITATED THE PRINCE SAID
BUT IN THAT CASE ALL THE GREATER REASON THEN HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT GIRL WILL BECOME THE STRONGEST PASSION OF THE KING'S LIFE
BUT A MAN WHO HAS THE WHOLE OF ONE HOUSE IS SATISFIED WITH IT AND DOES NOT REQUIRE TWO YES BUT TWO MEN BE IT SO
THRICE BY A WOMAN WHO EACH TIME CAME TO THE DOOR IN A CARRIAGE AND ENTERED COVERED WITH A VEIL WHICH SHE RAISED WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER AND ALONE DO YOU REMEMBER THAT WOMAN YES WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU THE YOUNG MAN SMILED MOURNFULLY AND THEN REPLIED SHE INQUIRED AS YOU HAVE JUST DONE IF I WERE HAPPY AND IF I WERE GETTING WEARY WHAT DID SHE DO ON ARRIVING AND ON LEAVING YOU SHE PRESSED ME IN HER ARMS HELD ME IN HER EMBRACE AND KISSED ME DO YOU REMEMBER HER PERFECTLY DO YOU RECALL HER FEATURES DISTINCTLY YES YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE HER THEN IF ACCIDENT BROUGHT HER BEFORE YOU OR LED YOU INTO HER PERSON MOST CERTAINLY A FLUSH OF FLEETING SATISFACTION PASSED ACROSS ARAMIS'S FACE
WELL MY POOR MANICAMP HE EXCLAIMED HOW VIOLET YOU LOOK
I TRUST IMPLICITLY TO A WOMAN'S INVENTION
ALL THE QUEEN-MOTHER'S JEWELS AS WELL AS A FEW BELONGING TO HIS WIFE--MONSIEUR WORE THEM ALL AND HE WAS AS DAZZLING AS THE RISING SUN
VERY WELL THEN
I HAVE SOUNDED ITS DEPTHS
AFTER HAVING WAITED TEN MINUTES MALICORNE ARRIVED FULL OF SELF-IMPORTANCE
FOR YOU MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE COURIER ALOUD PRESENTING A LETTER TO FOUQUET
YOU DID NOT SEE M
MY NOTE SURPRISED YOU TERRIFIED ME RATHER
YOU SAY THAT LIKE A MAN CONFESSING HIS SINS
IF WE ARE TOGETHER AND SHOULD BE MET BY ANY ONE WE SHALL LOOK AS IF WE HAD SOME MATTER OF BUSINESS IN HAND
OFTEN BECAUSE HE IS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED SAID BRAGELONNE
WE HOPED TO ENJOY TRANQUILLITY AFTER THAT MADMAN BUCKINGHAM HAD LEFT AND THIS IS WORSE I DO NOT SAY THAT MONSEIGNEUR YES BUT I SAY IT
AND WHY MOREOVER I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DISINCLINED TO AFFORD HIM SOME CONSOLATION OR SOME GOOD ADVICE
BESIDES YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED HOW THE PRINCESS'S GLANCE SOFTENS AS SHE LOOKS AT YOU;--YOU CAN TELL BY THE VERY INFLECTION OF HER VOICE WHAT PLEASURE SHE TAKES IN LISTENING TO YOU AND CAN FEEL HOW THOROUGHLY SHE APPRECIATES THE VERSES YOU RECITE TO HER
IT IS ENORMOUS I KNOW IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND NOT SO BUT REFLECT MADAME UPON THE EFFECT WHICH WILL BE PRODUCED BY THE SALE OF YOUR JEWELS NO ONE NEED KNOW IT
SAINT-AIGNAN STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE ENTRESOL WHERE THE MAIDS OF HONOR WERE LODGED AND TO THE FIRST FLOOR WHERE MADAME'S APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED
TO-MORROW MORNING MY VALET WILL TELL YOU THE EXACT HOUR OF OUR DEPARTURE
SAINT-AIGNAN WALKED ON BETWEEN ROWS OF MOUNTAIN-ASH LILAC AND HAWTHORN WHICH FORMED AN ALMOST IMPENETRABLE ROOF ABOVE HIS HEAD
SHE EXCLAIMED HIS UNHAPPY FRIEND AS HE RAISED HIS HAND CLENCHED IN ANGER TOWARDS HEAVEN
HOW WERE YOU ATTACKED SIRE STAMMERED OUT THE POOR CHILD PALE AND TREMBLING I REALLY DO NOT KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING TOO FAR SAID THE KING
DEAR MONSIEUR MALICORNE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN A VERY LUCKY ACCIDENT HAS BROUGHT ME BACK TO EXTRICATE YOU FROM YOUR EMBARRASSMENT
CALL CALL QUICKLY
BUT THIS DEFECT IN PERSONS OF HIGH RANK AND POSITION IS A GREAT ADVANTAGE AT A COURT
WHOEVER FLATTERS ME PLEASES ME
HE TOOK MANICAMP WITH HIM FOR HIS EQUABLE AND DREAMY DISPOSITION ACTED AS A COUNTERPOISE TO HIS OWN
THREE MEALS ARE SERVED AT THE BASTILE AND AS THE PRISONERS HAVING NOTHING TO DO ARE ALWAYS EATING A TEN-FRANC MAN COSTS ME SEVEN FRANCS AND A HALF BUT DID YOU NOT SAY THAT YOU TREATED THOSE AT TEN FRANCS LIKE THOSE AT FIFTEEN YES CERTAINLY VERY WELL
I WAS MISTAKEN RETURNED THE COURTIER
SO THAT SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SAYING AND MUST HAVE GROWN ALARMED OH SAID BRAGELONNE DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY
IS NOT ORLEANS YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE DO YOU ASK ME WHAT I HAVE TO DO HERE
ELEGANT REPASTS WERE SERVED OF WHICH THEY PARTOOK BUT LIGHTLY
THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED MADAME WAS STILL IN SIGHT
GREAT MILITARY MEN--MY COUSIN DE CONDE FOR INSTANCE--GROW PALE IN MEDITATION UPON THEIR STRATEGICAL PLANS BEFORE THEY MOVE ONE OF THE PAWNS WHICH PEOPLE CALL ARMIES
THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF TWELVE
DO YOU INVENT IN YOUR TURN WELL SIRE I HAVE HIT UPON SOMETHING
IT IS A FEAST FOR THE POOR DEVIL AND ONE MUST BE CHARITABLE YOU KNOW AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OUT OF YOUR FIVE-FRANC PRISONERS A FRANC AND A HALF BAISEMEAUX YOU'RE AN HONEST FELLOW
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST TURN THREE TIMES TO THE RIGHT THEN TWICE TO THE LEFT THEN TURN ONCE--STAY IS IT ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH
SO THAT IT WAS QUITE AGREED AMONG THE COURTIERS THAT THE GREATEST EVENT OF THE PERIOD HAD JUST BEEN REVEALED
BUT MADAME IS NOT A COQUETTE AT HEART THAT MAY BE BUT YOUR BROTHER IS EXCESSIVELY ANGRY ABOUT IT WHAT DOES HE WANT HE WANTS TO DROWN GUICHE THAT IS A VIOLENT MEASURE TO RESORT TO DO NOT LAUGH
IN FACT FROM THE MOMENT THEY QUITTED ENGLAND HE HAD GRADUALLY ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO HIS BEHAVIOR
A FEW FAUNS LIFTING UP THEIR CLOVEN FEET WERE JUMPING ABOUT
SILENCE M
A CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN HIS HOUSE SAID ARAMIS AND THAT WAS QUITE SUFFICIENT
AND YOU WILL RENOUNCE YOUR IDEA OF DYING AND WILL PRESERVE FOR YOUR FAMILY FOR THE KING AND FOR OUR SEX A CAVALIER WHOM EVERY ONE ESTEEMS AND WHOM MANY HOLD DEAR MADAME PRONOUNCED THIS LAST WORD IN SUCH AN ACCENT OF FRANKNESS AND EVEN OF TENDERNESS THAT POOR DE GUICHE'S HEART FELT ALMOST BURSTING
THE TWO QUEENS AND MADAME EXAMINED WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION THE TOILETTES OF THEIR LADIES AND MAIDS OF HONOR
BUT MY OPINION IS THE VERY OPPOSITE TO YOUR OWN AND YOU ARE AT PERFECT LIBERTY TO MAINTAIN IT MONSIEUR
LET US GO THE DUKE LEFT HIS ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY THE CHEVALIER AND WENT TOWARDS MADAME'S APARTMENTS
WHY DO YOU DISTILL INTO THE HEART OF THE MAN YOU TERM YOUR FRIEND ALL THE BITTERNESS THAT INFECTS YOUR OWN
THE PROMENADE WAS THEREFORE CONTINUED
FAR FROM THAT OR RATHER AN INDIFFERENT ADMINISTRATOR
BELIEVE ME I SINCERELY REGRET HAVING ISOLATED YOU FROM THE REST OF THE COMPANY AND BROUGHT YOU ALSO TO A SPOT WHERE YOU WILL BE INCONVENIENCED BY THE RAIN
WE HAVE FOUND A REMEDY SO SEATING HERSELF BETWEEN HER TWO COMPANIONS AND TAKING EACH OF THEM BY THE HAND WHICH SHE HELD IN HER OWN SHE BEGAN
FANCY PRINCESS YOU UNDERSTAND SIRE IT IS THE NAIAD WHO IS SPEAKING THE KING BOWED ASSENTINGLY
I DREAMED THAT THE KING WON THE BRACELETS THE KING YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME I THINK WHAT THE KING COULD POSSIBLY DO WITH THE BRACELETS YES AND YOU WOULD NOT ADD PERHAPS THAT IT WOULD BE VERY FORTUNATE IF THE KING WERE REALLY TO WIN FOR HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO GIVE THE BRACELETS TO SOME ONE ELSE TO RESTORE THEM TO YOU FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH CASE I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY GIVE THEM AWAY
THEN STOOPING TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN OCCUPY MADAME DE SAINT-REMY EITHER IN DISPUTING WITH HER OR MAKING IT UP WITH HER
TELL ME
FAUCHEUX THERE IS ALSO THE SERVICE WHICH BELONGED TO MY MOTHER
FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE PLACES THEY COULD PICK UP THE REMARKS WHICH FELL FROM THE PRINCIPAL GROUP
THEY FOUND ME WHEN I HAD FAINTED ON THE ROAD OVERCOME BY THE HEAT AND WITHOUT THINKING OF WHETHER THEY WOULD BE PAID FOR THEIR TROUBLE THEY WISHED TO CARRY ME TO THEIR OWN HOME
THEY HAVE MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT
MONSIEUR SINGING LAUGHING AND ADMIRING HIMSELF PASSED AWAY THE TIME UNTIL THE DINNER-HOUR IN A FRAME OF MIND THAT JUSTIFIED THE PROVERB OF HAPPY AS A PRINCE CHAPTER LVI
MANICAMP INQUIRED THE PRINCE
THAT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY HE WAS CRAZY OVER MADAME
I WAS BLIND AS YOU WERE A LITTLE WHILE SINCE
FOR BUCKINGHAM WOULD NEVER HAVE VENTURED UPON A FOURTH PART OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST NOW SEEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO CONCEAL ONESELF FOR THE PURPOSES OF DANCING AND TO FEIGN INDISPOSITION IN ORDER TO DINE TETE-A-TETE NO NO MONSEIGNEUR YES YES EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE EXCITING HIMSELF LIKE A SELF-WILLED CHILD
IT TRANSLATES TO FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF GOD FOOTNOTE 8
AND WHEN THE THUNDER WAS AGAIN HEARD IT WAS PASSING AS PLAINLY AS IF DURING THOSE SAME FIVE MINUTES THE STORM PUT TO FLIGHT HAD TRAVERSED THE HEAVENS WITH THE WINGS OF THE WIND
IS NOT THAT YOUR OPINION SAID FOUQUET
AFTER HAVING ABANDONED THE FIRST FEW MOMENTS TO THE IRREPRESSIBLE EMOTIONS SHE EXPERIENCED THE QUEEN RESUMED THE SMILING AIR WITH WHICH SHE HAD RECEIVED HIM
SUCH AT LEAST WAS THE OPINION I FORMED OF HER WHEN SHE RESIDED IN FRANCE
MANICAMP HAS CONVERSED WITH YOU AS LONG AS HE LIKED AND NOW IT IS MY TURN IF YOU PLEASE
TELL ME MY DEAR COMTE WHAT RHYME YOU WERE TRYING TO FIND SAID MANICAMP
BESIDES I DID NOT THINK THAT YOUR MAJESTY WOULD ATTACH ANY VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO WHAT YOU HEARD KNOWING HOW MUCH YOUR ATTENTION WAS TAKEN UP BY MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
THE GAMES WILL BE HELD TOMORROW FOOTNOTE 11
IF YOU WOULD DEIGN TO ACCEPT AND REPLY TO MY AFFECTION MY AFFECTION SHALL PROVE ITS GRATITUDE TO YOU IN MAKING YOU FREE AND INDEPENDENT FOREVER HAVING FINISHED WRITING FOUQUET LOOKED AT ARAMIS
YOUR MAJESTY I REMEMBER AH IF SHE HAS NO LOVER SHE HAS AT LEAST A BETROTHED A BETROTHED WHAT
AFTER HE HAD APOLOGIZED TO EACH OF THEM FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE HE MIGHT HAVE PUT THEM TO HE TURNED TOWARDS DE WARDES WHO IN SPITE OF HIS CUSTOMARY SELF-COMMAND COULD NOT PREVENT HIS FACE BETRAYING SOME SURPRISE MINGLED WITH NOT A LITTLE UNEASINESS
AND LOUISE I PERCEIVE IS A COQUETTE WITHOUT KNOWING IT OH SAID LA VALLIERE
LET US PASS FROM THE QUESTION OF MONEY TO THAT OF RANK SAID LOUIS XIV
I OBSERVE HE SAID THAT YOU HAVE AS MUCH GENEROSITY AS INTELLIGENCE AND I READ IN YOUR EYES THE FORGIVENESS I SOLICIT
ABSURD I KNOW IT TO BE AND YET ONE WHICH RENDS MY VERY HEART ARE YOU GOING AWAY THEN FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME INQUIRED LA VALLIERE WITH FALTERING UTTERANCE WHILE MONTALAIS TURNED HER HEAD ASIDE
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT YOU ARE KILLING ME A JEST NOTHING BUT A JEST MURMURED THE KING WHO HOWEVER BEGAN TO BE SOMEWHAT AFFECTED
D'ARTAGNAN BECAUSE HE WAS GUILTY OF A COWARDLY ACT TOWARDS MY FATHER YOU LIE MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL COOLLY
I HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO THE FORTUNE DUE TO MY RANK AND TO MY BIRTH
RISE RISE SAID MONTALAIS TO HIM READY TO CRY FOR ATHENAIS IS COMING RAOUL ROSE BRUSHED HIS KNEE WITH THE BACK OF HIS HAND SMILED AGAIN UPON LOUISE WHOSE EYES WERE FIXED ON THE GROUND AND HAVING PRESSED MONTALAIS'S HAND GRATEFULLY HE TURNED ROUND TO SALUTE MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE THE SOUND OF WHOSE SILKEN ROBE WAS ALREADY HEARD UPON THE GRAVEL WALK
HE IS A PREY TO A MAD PASSION THAT MAKES HIM CONFIDE HIS GRIEF TO THE TREES OR TO THE AIR FROM THE VERY MOMENT HE HAS NO LONGER ANY LIVING BEING IN REACH OF HIS VOICE
BUT ONLY IN A FEW DAYS
I HAVE SOME INFLUENCE OVER YOUNG PEOPLE BUT I CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WITHOUT RUNNING THE CHANCES OF LOSING IT ALTOGETHER
WHICH MY FRIEND THE COMTE DE GUICHE WILL OBTAIN FOR MY FRIEND MALICORNE THAT'S IT SAID MANICAMP
HE THEN TURNED TOWARDS MADAME FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADMIRING HER ALSO A LITTLE IN HER TURN
YES WE ARE MISTAKEN
ONLY AS THE ATTENTION YOU HAVE SHOWN ME DESERVES TO BE REWARDED TAKE THESE TWO LOUIS AND DEPART IN PEACE THE PEASANTS DID NOT DARE TO TAKE THEM
AS HE STOOPED DOWN ARAMIS OBSERVED THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PAPER HE HAD GIVEN THE FRANCISCAN HAD ESCAPED BEING BURNT
YOUR HEART IS SO SOFT AND YIELDING SHE SAID SPITEFULLY
THE STRANGE CONFUSED AND ANIMATED MURMURS WHICH SEEMED BORN AND TO EXIST IN VIRTUE OF THE SUN THAT RESPIRATION OF NATURE WHICH IS UNCEASINGLY HEARD AMIDST ALL OTHER SOUNDS COULD NOT BE HEARD NOW AND NEVER HAD THE SILENCE BEEN SO PROFOUND
OH CERTAINLY WILL SHE DO WHAT YOU ASK HER EVERYTHING
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED YOU KNOW I ATTACH LITTLE VALUE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BUT GENTLE BIRTH TO BOAST OF ASSUREDLY SAID DE WARDES
THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT I SAID JUST NOW VERY WELL
I PLACE MY DEVOTION AT YOUR FEET
ALL THREE OF THEM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ALL THREE DO YOU NOT SEE THAT DE GUICHE IS ONE OF THE PARTY YES I SEE
WHEN ALL THE TRAVELERS WERE LODGED THE LANDLORD ENTERED MALICORNE'S ROOM AND WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED COURTEOUSNESS SAID TO HIM YOU ARE AWARE MY DEAR MONSIEUR THAT THE LARGE ROOM IN THE THIRD DETACHED BUILDING IS STILL RESERVED FOR YOU OF COURSE I AM AWARE OF IT I AM REALLY MAKING YOU A PRESENT OF IT THANK YOU SO THAT WHEN YOUR FRIEND COMES WELL HE WILL BE SATISFIED WITH ME I HOPE
ARAMIS WHO DID NOT EXPECT SUCH AN AMOUNT DROPPED HIS PEN
THIS INTERVAL HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY POOR DE GUICHE IN RECEIVING VISITS
YES REPLIED THE CHEVALIER IN THE SAME TONE
AFTER OR RATHER BEFORE MYSELF YOU HAVE A MASTER TO CONSULT THAT MASTER BEING THE KING
OH HEAVENS
DURING THIS RAOUL MADE A SIGN TO BUCKINGHAM
BUT IS NOT AN AFFAIR OF MONEY WHAT IS IT THEN
THE CHEVALIER ON HIS SIDE HAVING ON THE CONTRARY LEARNED NOTHING AT ALL WITHDREW WITH A PROFOUND SALUTATION
GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD ATTACK OF INDIGESTION WITH YOUR EXCELLENT LIVING AND PUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY BETWEEN THIS AND MIDDAY TO-MORROW HOW CAN YOU BE HARD-HEARTED ENOUGH TO LAUGH NAY YOU REALLY AFFLICT ME
THE HUMBLE HANDS WHICH FOR A MOMENT TOUCHED THESE JEWELS DEPRIVED THEM FOR THE TIME OF THEIR IMPORTANCE--A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER PREVENT MONTALAIS FROM STARTING WITH JOY ENVY AND COVETOUS DESIRE AT THE SIGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL STONES STILL MORE THAN AT THEIR MAGNIFICENT WORKMANSHIP
THE BOAT WAS ABOUT TO SET OFF WHEN DE GUICHE CALLED TO THE PILOT
HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ONE PERSON ALONE
BUT HE ADDED LAUGHING ALL THIS TIME WE ARE FORGETTING OUR FRIEND DU VALLON
OF A SENSITIVE CHARACTER PROUD AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEEP ATTACHMENT HE CURSED THE DAY ON WHICH SUCH A PASSION HAD ENTERED HIS HEART
ANOTHER DOUBT AND THAT A CRUEL ONE SUGGESTED ITSELF TO MADAME DE BELLIERE WITH A SHARP ACUTE PAIN LIKE A DAGGER THRUST
HE IS NOT AN ILL-FAVORED SHEPHERD
THE DETAILS HAVE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN OF WHAT FOLLOWED THIS EXPULSION
SOME OF THE COMPANY WITH MINDS ILL AT EASE ON THE SUBJECT RAISED THEIR EYES FROM TIME TO TIME TOWARDS THE SKY
YES YES I EXCUSE YOU
I HEAR FOOTSTEPS GOOD HEAVENS IN FACT THE FANCIED FOOTSTEPS SOON BECAME A REALITY
AT THE SIGN THE KING HAD MADE TO HIM FOUQUET HAD HASTENED UP THE STAIRCASE WHILE ARAMIS WHO WAS WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT QUIETLY RETIRED AMONG THE GROUP OF COURTIERS AND DISAPPEARED WITHOUT HAVING BEEN EVEN OBSERVED BY THE KING
I AM NO SUBJECT OF THE KING OF FRANCE
HAVING DESCENDED TO THE REGION OF PETTY HUMAN MISERIES HE WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO PALTRY CONTENTIONS
BUT AS IT IS NECESSARY I MUST SUBMIT TO IT AT LEAST TELL ME WHAT IT IS SAID THE KING
IN A WORD YOU THOUGHT THAT AS THE PEOPLE HAD NO MONEY THERE WOULD BE NONE FOR YOUR MAJESTY EITHER YES I THOUGHT SO
MONSIEUR APPROACHED HER
NOT ALONE ABOUT YOURSELF BUT ALSO ABOUT THOSE ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONS WHOM YOUR DEVOTION IS COMPROMISING IN SO ABSURD A MANNER YOU ARE RIGHT YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF
IT SEEMS YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF SALT WATER YOUNG GENTLEMEN WE ARE AFRAID OF NOTHING REPLIED DE GUICHE
BREATHE
SHE MAY SOME DAY WOUND HERSELF WITH ONE OF THOSE ARROWS SHE DISCHARGES AS YOU SAY SO MERCILESSLY ON ALL SIDES IT IS THE HOPE OF SHEPHERDS ONE AND ALL SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
BUT THE KING AFTER A HASTY REFLECTION FOLLOWED HIM AND THAT TOO WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT ALTHOUGH MALICORNE WAS ALREADY MORE THAN HALF-WAY UP THE STAIRCASE THE KING REACHED THE ROOM AT THE SAME MOMENT
AND FOR THE VERY SAME REASON THAT HE WOULD NOT GIVE THEM BACK AGAIN TO ME
CHAPTER LVII
NOTHING NOTHING
MOREOVER I HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK TO YOU UPON CERTAIN SUBJECTS WHICH REQUIRE BOTH PRUDENCE AND SOLITUDE MONSIEUR MANICAMP BUT EVERYTHING I WISH TO SAY IS PERFECTLY HONORABLE I ASSURE YOU I THINK MONSIEUR MANICAMP IT WILL BE MORE BECOMING IN ME TO TAKE MY LEAVE NO NO!--LISTEN TO ME OR I WILL JUMP FROM MY PERCH HERE TO YOURS
D'ARTAGNAN WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE GROUP AND CIVILLY SALUTED M
WHICH WAS NOT TO SLEEP OUT IN THE OPEN AIR AND ANY MAN MIGHT EXPRESS THE SAME WISH WHILST YOU HOWEVER ADMIT NOTHING BELIEVE ME MY DEAR MONSIEUR MALICORNE SAINT-AIGNAN PERSISTED THAT IF I WERE PERMITTED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF I WOULD DO SO IN THAT CASE MY DEAR MONSIEUR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ALLOW YOU TO ENTER MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS'S APARTMENT WHY SO YOU KNOW WHY BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE SINCE YOU CAUGHT ME ON THE WALL PAYING MY ADDRESSES TO MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS
INSTEAD OF WEARING SUCH MEAN HABILIMENTS AS HIS PATERNAL FORTUNES ENTITLED HIM TO HE WAS ABLE TO APPEAR BRILLIANT SUPERB LIKE A YOUNG NOBLE OF FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR
HE WILL BE LAUGHED AT INSTEAD OF YOU
THEIR VERY NATURES SEEMED FROM THE BEGINNING DISPOSED TO TAKE EXCEPTION TO EACH OTHER
YOU WILL ONLY HAVE TO FORGET ME IN SECOND OR FOURTH BERTAUDIERE AND THEN YOU ARE REFUSING AN OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY NEVER PRESENT ITSELF AGAIN
IN ANY CASE IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY RECENTLY FOR THE APPOINTMENT WAS VACANT EIGHT DAYS AGO
I HAVE GONE SO FAR I CANNOT RECEDE
OH EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG MAN CAN I NOT FIND SOME ONE ON WHOM TO WREAK MY VENGEANCE YOU CAN MONSIEUR FOR I AM HERE WHISPERED A VOICE FULL OF MENACE IN HIS EAR
YOU HAVE TOLD ME THREE TIMES LAUGHING ALL THE WHILE THAT YOU DID NOT LOVE ME
CHAPTER XV
THE SQUARE BELONGS TO ME AS WELL AS THE HOUSES IN IT FORGIVE ME MONSIEUR BUT YOU ARE MISTAKEN THERE
DE WARDES EXCLAIMED MANICAMP NOTICING THAT THE YOUNG MAN HAD SPURRED HIS HORSE CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF RAOUL
AND THEN SHE BELIEVED SHE DETESTED MALICORNE
AND TO LEAVE US TO PASS THE NIGHT ON THESE BRANCHES IS IN FACT CONDEMNING US TO DEATH OH SAID MONTALAIS MONSIEUR MALICORNE IS SO ROBUST THAT A NIGHT PASSED IN THE OPEN AIR WITH THE BEAUTIFUL STARS ABOVE HIM WILL NOT DO HIM ANY HARM AND IT WILL BE A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR THE TRICK HE HAS PLAYED ME BE IT SO THEN
IT IS A WOLF OR A WILD BOAR CRIED MONTALAIS
I HAVE LOVED YOU FOR A LONG WHILE PAST
SURELY NOT ON ACCOUNT OF A YOUNG GIRL'S HARMLESS AND VERY INNOCENT JEST
D'ARTAGNAN JUST NOW DICTATED AND WHICH I AM FORCED TO MAKE TO YOU ONE MOMENT MONSIEUR SAID THE MUSKETEER WITH THE GREATEST TRANQUILLITY YOU MISTAKE THE TERMS OF THE APOLOGY
FOR MY OWN PART I CONFESS WHEN I SAW THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S HEART WAS SO TAKEN UP BY THIS LITTLE MY HEART TAKEN UP
ARAMIS SMILED
IT WAS MONSIEUR HIMSELF FOLLOWED BY THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE AND BY HIS FAVORITES THE LATTER BEING THEMSELVES FOLLOWED BY A PORTION OF THE KING'S MILITARY HOUSEHOLD WHO HAD ARRIVED TO MEET HIS AFFIANCED BRIDE
THE DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL LAUGH TOO
THE SOFTNESS OF THE AIR THE STILLNESS OF THE FOLIAGE TACITLY IMPOSED UPON THESE YOUNG GIRLS AN ENGAGEMENT TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY THEIR GIDDY CONVERSATION FOR ONE OF A MORE SERIOUS CHARACTER
MY OBJECT WAS TO GIVE THEM WITHOUT AROUSING ANY ONE'S JEALOUSY
AT THIS MOMENT THE LANDLORD APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR
FOUQUET FOR MONEY
IT IS NOT BY MEANS OF RUIN OR WAR OR FORCE THAT THE SOCIETY OF JESUS IS TO BE GOVERNED BUT BY THAT MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE MORAL SUPERIORITY ALONE CONFERS
YOU OWE HIS FATHER THIRTY THOUSAND CROWNS AH INDEED
AND WAS FULL OF DELIGHT THINKING THAT HER STORY HAD BEEN OR WAS TO BE THE TERMINATION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
HUSH WHISPERED THE YOUNG GIRL HOLDING MADAME BACK WITH A HURRIED GESTURE ENTIRELY FORGETFUL OF HER COMPANION'S RANK
NOW MY DEAR GOVERNOR HE CONTINUED AS IF THIS LAST COMMUNICATION HAD EXHAUSTED HIS INTEREST LET US NOW TURN OVER TO OUR OWN LITTLE AFFAIRS WELL WHAT TIME FOR REPAYMENT DO YOU WISH ME TO TAKE
SHE LOOKED AT HIM SO SADLY AND WITH SO MUCH TENDERNESS THAT HE FELT HIS HEART GIVING WAY UNDER HER GAZE
I MEAN LA VALLIERE AH
YOU ARE RICH THEN I HAVE STILL FIFTY PISTOLES LEFT EXACTLY THE SUM I WANT
I MAINTAIN THAT TO ADOPT TOWARDS THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM OR ANY OTHER ENGLISHMAN ANY RIGOROUS MEASURE--TO TAKE EVEN A DISCOURTEOUS STEP TOWARDS HIM WOULD BE TO PLUNGE FRANCE AND ENGLAND INTO THE MOST DISASTROUS DISAGREEMENT
WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY IS NOW KNOWN,--IT IS A TEXT ON WHICH EVERY ONE IS DISCOURSING
LOUISE A MAID OF HONOR IN THE COURT OF A YOUNG PRINCESS IN THESE DAYS OF FREE MANNERS AND INCONSTANT AFFECTIONS--A MAID OF HONOR IS PLACED AS AN OBJECT OF ATTACK WITHOUT HAVING ANY MEANS OF DEFENCE AFFORDED HER
AHA HE SAID
DE GUICHE ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT
AS THEY WERE GOING ALONG RAOUL WAS ENGAGED IN DEVISING HIS SCHEME OF ACTION
THE ORDER HOWEVER WAS EXPLICIT
RAOUL CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
YET AS SHE IS MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW REST ASSURED I SHALL BE INTERESTED EVEN WERE IT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE ALONE IN HEARING ALL YOU MAY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT HER PRAY TELL ME MADAME IN YOUR TURN WHETHER YOU HAVE NOT REMARKED SOMETHING SOMETHING
WHEN THE KING WAS SEATED AS SOON AS HE HAD REMARKED WITH THAT ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM THE DISORDER OF THE APARTMENT AND THE NO LESS GREAT DISORDER OF MADAME'S COUNTENANCE HE ASSUMED A PLAYFUL MANNER SAYING MY DEAR SISTER AT WHAT HOUR TO-DAY WOULD YOU WISH THE REPETITION OF THE BALLET TO TAKE PLACE MADAME SHAKING HER CHARMING HEAD SLOWLY AND LANGUISHINGLY SAID
YET LOUISE IN VERY TRUTH I KNOW NOT HOW OR WHY BUT THIS HAPPINESS AND THIS FUTURE SEEM TO VANISH BEFORE MY VERY EYES LIKE MIST--LIKE AN IDLE DREAM
IN WHAT WAY IN ANY CASE THIS PASSION WILL MAKE SOME ONE VERY HAPPY EVEN IF IT BE ONLY LA VALLIERE HERSELF REALLY CONTINUED THE PRINCESS YOU SPEAK AS IF YOU HAD READ INTO THE INMOST RECESSES OF LA VALLIERE'S HEART
BUT ABOVE THEM ALL THE WOMAN'S VOICE PREVAILED
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS ETEXT I HAVE CHOSEN TO SPLIT THE NOVEL AS THE FOUR-VOLUME EDITION DOES WITH THESE TITLES
YES THE SAME AS THAT ONE IS THAT MARCHIALI AN ITALIAN SAID ARAMIS POINTING WITH HIS FINGER TO THE NAME WHICH HAD ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION
AND NEITHER THE NAIAD NOR THE DRYAD HAD BREATHED A WORD ABOUT IT
YOU GIVE ME THE LIE MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
ANNE OF AUSTRIA DID NOT FEEL SATISFIED WITH THE TIME HER ELDEST SON DEVOTED TO HER
NO SOONER WAS THIS REALLY ROYAL BOAT AFLOAT AND THE ROWERS WITH OARS UPLIFTED AWAITING LIKE SOLDIERS PRESENTING ARMS THE EMBARKATION OF THE PRINCESS THAN BUCKINGHAM RAN FORWARD TO THE LADDER IN ORDER TO TAKE HIS PLACE
MONSIEUR HARDLY KNOWING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO INFLICT HIS WEARINESS WENT TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS DRESSED IN HIS MORNING-GOWN
A MAID OF HONOR
BUT IN THIS RESPECT THE WORTHY M
HE IS MAN WHOSE WEAKNESS D'ARTAGNAN ATHOS AND MYSELF ARE ALONE ACQUAINTED WITH
I SIMPLY EXPRESS WHAT I DESIRE
THE KING AND FOUQUET MET AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE
YOU KNOW THAT HE IS NATURALLY VERY FOND OF WALKING YES
MANICAMP BEGAN TO SCOOP UP HIS GOLD BY HANDFULS AND POUR IT IN CASCADES UPON HIS BED
SAINT-AIGNAN I RELY UPON YOU TO PROCURE ME EVERY INFORMATION ABOUT HER YES SIRE AND WHEN SHALL I HAVE THE HONOR OF SEEING YOUR MAJESTY AGAIN TO GIVE YOU THE LATEST NEWS WHENEVER YOU HAVE PROCURED IT I SHALL OBTAIN IT SPEEDILY THEN IF THE INFORMATION CAN BE AS QUICKLY OBTAINED AS MY WISH TO SEE YOUR MAJESTY AGAIN WELL SAID COUNT
THE SOUND OF MANY FEET UPON THE GRAVEL WALK MADE HER TURN ROUND
MAUVAISECORNE MALICORNE MONSIEUR LE COMTE FORGIVE ME
THE TONE YOU ASSUME AND THE STYLE WHICH IS PECULIARLY YOUR OWN IS THAT OF A JESUIT AND NOT OF A GENTLEMAN
COLBERT'S I AGREE SAID THE MARQUISE EAGERLY
GIVE ME YOUR OPINION EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE
AS I PERCEIVED THAT SHE ACCOSTED ME BY TOUCHING THE HEM OF MY DRESS I COULD NOT THINK OF RECEIVING HER ADVANCES UNGRACIOUSLY AND MORE PARTICULARLY SO SINCE AFTER ALL A DIVINITY EVEN THOUGH SHE BE OF A SECOND GRADE IS ALWAYS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN A MORTAL THOUGH A PRINCESS
THE CONFUSION IS GENERATED BY THE TWO FACTS THAT WE PUBLISHED TEN YEARS LATER BEFORE WE PUBLISHED TWENTY YEARS AFTER AND THAT MANY PEOPLE SEE THOSE TITLES AS MEANING TEN AND TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE ORIGINAL STORY...HOWEVER THIS IS WHY THE DIFFERENT WORDS AFTER AND LATER"...THE TEN YEARS AFTER IS TEN YEARS AFTER THE TWENTY YEARS LATER...AS PER HISTORY
THE BRIGADIER'S NAME WAS THE COMTE DE WOSTPUR.--A SPANISH CARDINAL WITH TWO NEPHEWS TWO SECRETARIES AN OFFICER OF HIS HOUSEHOLD AND TWELVE HORSES
IT WAS NOT I WHO OPENED YOUR EYES IT WAS DE GUICHE
I KNOW YOUR DISPOSITION
COULD I HAVE BEEN BLIND THEN TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT AND COULD HE HAVE LOVED HER FOR THIS LAST MONTH AND AS MADAME HAD NOTHING TO DO SHE SAT DOWN TO BEGIN A LETTER TO HER BROTHER THE POSTSCRIPT OF WHICH WAS A SUMMONS FOR BRAGELONNE TO RETURN
FOUQUET FOR HIS INDIFFERENCE IN WHAT WAY SIRE I WILL CHANGE YOUR BISHOPRIC FOUQUET BIT HIS LIPS BUT ARAMIS ONLY SMILED
BUT THE KING SIMPLY BOWED AND DETERMINEDLY REFUSED TO COVER HIS HEAD
KEEP YOUR BREVET
ELISE
WHAT COUNTRY-TOWN HAVE WE HAD SENT HERE MONTALAIS SAID THE CHEVALIER,--"OH I KNOW HER
THE GOOD JESUIT COMPLETELY SUBDUED ROSE AND LEFT THE ROOM
TO THE LANDLORD OF THE BEAU PAON HOTEL,--YOU WILL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE MEETING ARRANGED TO TAKE PLACE IN YOUR INN BETWEEN SOME PEOPLE OF IMPORTANCE
WHEN I AM KING I PROMISE YOU ONE THING WHAT
ITS INTRINSIC VALUE DOES NOT EXCEED THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS THIRTY THOUSAND MURMURED THE MARQUISE
DE GUICHE JUST NOW SAID ATHENAIS
I SHOULD HESITATE ALSO ON DE BRAGELONNE'S ACCOUNT TO ENDOW WITH A FORTUNE WITHOUT SOME SOUND REASON FOR IT A YOUNG GIRL A PERFECT STRANGER
THE RUMOR OF THIS EXTRAVAGANT PROFUSENESS DELIGHTED THE HEARTS OF ALL THE SHOPKEEPERS IN PARIS
WOMEN YOU KNOW ARE CHARACTERS FULL OF IMPERFECTIONS CREATED FOR THE MISFORTUNE OF MANKIND
YOUR SENTINELS BECAUSE YOU WISH TO PASS ON HORSEBACK AND ORDERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO LET ONLY PERSONS ON FOOT PASS NO ONE HAS ANY RIGHT TO GIVE ORDERS HERE EXCEPT MYSELF SAID BUCKINGHAM
IT WAS EVIDENT HOWEVER THAT AS THE MAN PURSUED WAS WALKING QUIETLY IN A PENSIVE MANNER WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN EITHER BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF GRIEF OR HAPPINESS WHEN ONCE THE ANGLE WAS PASSED UNLESS INDEED HE WERE TO ENTER BY SOME DOOR OR ANOTHER THE CHEVALIER COULD NOT FAIL TO OVERTAKE HIM
D'HERBLAY AND HE OFFERED TO BECOME MY SURETY FOR THE DIFFERENT PAYMENTS YOU ASTOUND ME
THE KING IS IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL YOU MEAN DEEPLY AND WHAT IS WORSE IS THAT ON HER SIDE THE GIRL IS PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO HIM AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT WE MUST CHANGE OUR TACTICS I SUPPOSE NOT A DOUBT OF IT
DE MANICAMP THIS PAINFUL TASK ACCOMPLISHED HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN IN BED AGAIN
I AM THE UNHAPPIEST PRINCE IN THE CHRISTIAN WORLD SINCE I AM POWERLESS TO INDUCE BELIEF IN MY WORDS IN ONE WHOM I LOVE THE BEST IN THE WIDE WORLD AND WHO ALMOST BREAKS MY HEART BY REFUSING TO CREDIT MY REGARD FOR HER OH SIRE SAID LA VALLIERE GENTLY PUTTING THE KING ASIDE WHO HAD APPROACHED NEARER TO HER I THINK THE STORM HAS PASSED AWAY NOW AND THE RAIN HAS CEASED AT THE VERY MOMENT HOWEVER AS THE POOR GIRL FLEEING AS IT WERE FROM HER OWN HEART WHICH DOUBTLESS THROBBED BUT TOO WELL IN UNISON WITH THE KING'S UTTERED THESE WORDS THE STORM UNDERTOOK TO CONTRADICT HER
WAIT WAIT
BUT AS SHE ROSE NOTWITHSTANDING HER PREOCCUPATION OF MIND SHE GLANCED HASTILY TOWARDS HER RIGHT
AT THIS MOMENT A YOUNG MAN CAME FORWARD OF EXTREMELY HANDSOME FEATURES AND WHOSE DRESS AND ARMS WERE REMARKABLE FOR THEIR EXTRAVAGANCE OF MATERIAL
IT IS POSITIVELY UNHEARD OF CONTINUED MONTALAIS
MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY TAKE CARE YOUR CONFIDENCE IS BECOMING AUDACITY ONE CAN WELL BE AUDACIOUS WHEN ONE IS POWERFUL AND YOU ARE POWERFUL I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED YOU TEN MILLIONS
AS THEY APPROACHED THE CRIES WERE MORE DISTINCTLY HEARD
SIRE I TOO SHALL BE JEALOUS OF IT AND WANT RESTORED TO ME
MALICORNE FIDDLESTICKS ASK MY COMPANION IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME I SHALL ASK NO ONE TO EXPLAIN MATTERS I KNOW BETTER THAN ANY ONE COMPOSE YOURSELF M
AND WAS MADAME ON HER SIDE INTOXICATED WITH THE POWER SHE WIELDED AS SHE BEHELD EVERY ONE AT HER FEET
WHY IT IS FIFTEEN LEAGUES FROM THIS PLACE TO ETAMPES FOURTEEN WELL
THIS CONCLUSION BEING THAT ALTHOUGH THE KING MAY HAVE TAKEN A SUDDEN FANCY TO HER THAT FANCY HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED
WHAT DISGRACED PERSON ARE YOU SPEAKING OF INQUIRED MADAME LOOKING ALL ROUND AND NOT PERMITTING HER GLANCE TO REST MORE ON THE COUNT THAN ON THE OTHERS
YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAINT-AIGNAN
FOUQUET THREW HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
LEAVE THINGS I BEG AS THEY ARE NOW IS IT POSSIBLE
A BISHOP IS NOT ALWAYS A RESIDENT
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WAS THERE AND I FEARED AN UTTER FAILURE IF I ASKED TOO MUCH AT ONCE
THE DUKE COULD NOT FAIL TO MARK THIS CHANGE AND HIS HEART WAS CRUELLY HURT
IN THAT CASE I AM INDEED UNHAPPY AND GREATLY TO BE PITIED YES VERY UNHAPPY AND VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED MONSIEUR DE GUICHE FOR YOU SEEM TO BE SUFFERING TERRIBLY OH
NOW BY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TO SEND THIS LETTER ASKED ARAMIS
ANNE OF AUSTRIA EFFECTED A DIVERSION BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FAMOUS LOTTERY TO TAKE PLACE IN HER APARTMENTS ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING
BUT FOUQUET WHETHER HE HAD OR HAD NOT RECOGNIZED DE GUICHE SIMPLY REPLIED NO MONSIEUR IT WAS NOT THE KING THE CHEVALIER DISAPPOINTED IN HIS EXPECTATION SALUTED THEM
TO LEAVE YOU WITH US A LITTLE WHILE LONGER I AM OVERWHELMED MONSEIGNEUR BY SO MUCH KINDNESS REPLIED BUCKINGHAM
THEY DO NOT OFTEN SEE RHINE CARP OR CHANNEL STURGEON BUT DO NOT THE FIVE-FRANC GENTLEMEN SOMETIMES LEAVE SOME SCRAPS OH
D'ARTAGNAN RECEIVED HIS VISITORS WITH ALL THE COURTESY HE WAS CAPABLE OF
I NEVER MENTIONED THE HIGHEST NAMES IN THE KINGDOM
HE RECEIVED THE COMPACT AS A SOLEMN BARGAIN WRUNG BY AFFECTION FROM HER CHILD-LIKE TIMIDITY
SINCE I AM HERE SAID ATHOS SUDDENLY CANNOT I SEE M
THE CHEVALIER KNEW THAT SINCE HE HAD SEEN HER NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WITH A GENTLEMAN THE GENTLEMAN IN QUESTION COULD NOT BE FAR OFF
WHAT MATTERS HALF AN HOUR MORE OR LESS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SO MUCH THE WORSE EXCLAIMED D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING
SIRE SHE SAID I PREFER SHAME TO DISLOYALTY WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED THE KING WITHOUT MOVING A STEP TO RAISE THE YOUNG GIRL FROM HER KNEES
HE FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND ONE OF THOSE PROFOUND LOOKS WHICH A BOSOM FRIEND OR MOTHER CAN ALONE EXTEND EITHER AS PROTECTOR OR GUARDIAN OVER THE ONE WHO IS ABOUT TO STRAY FROM THE RIGHT PATH
IT WAS SHE WHO NOW HELD BACK HER COMPANION AND WITH A LIGHT STEP LEADING HER SOME TWENTY PACES AWAY THAT IS TO SAY OUT OF THE REACH OF THE VOICE SHE SAID REMAIN HERE MY DEAR ATHENAIS AND LET NO ONE SURPRISE US
THREE YEARS INCOME FOR THE GOOD-WILL THE DEUCE
I AM COME TO TELL YOU THAT MADAME HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND IS COMING TO MARRY THE KING'S BROTHER INDEED MALICORNE YOU ARE INSUPPORTABLE WITH YOUR NEWS OF THE LAST CENTURY
THE FRANCISCAN THANKED THE SIGNOR MARINI
THE LADIES OF HONOR WERE RANGED IN A LINE ON HIS PASSAGE ALONG THE GALLERY
BAISEMEAUX TOOK FROM THE CUPBOARD A PRIVATE REGISTER LIKE THE ONE HE HAD ALREADY SHOWN ARAMIS BUT FASTENED BY A LOCK THE KEY WHICH OPENED IT BEING ONE OF A SMALL BUNCH WHICH BAISEMEAUX ALWAYS CARRIED WITH HIM
IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID THAT HEAVEN HAS GRACIOUSLY GRANTED TO WOMEN ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR VERY WEAKNESS MORE THAN IT HAS ACCORDED TO OTHER CREATURES
BUT WHY IN THE NAME OF FORTUNE DID M
I HAVE NOT DISLIKED YOU HITHERTO BUT SINCE YOU GIVE ME SUCH A CHARACTER I HATE YOU AND WILL DO ALL I POSSIBLY CAN TO KILL YOU AND DE WARDES SALUTED BUCKINGHAM
I DO NOT KNOW MY OWN OPINION IS THAT HE MUST BE REPLIED THE CHEVALIER FOR HE MAKES MADAME LAUGH AND SHE SEEMS TO TAKE NO LITTLE PLEASURE IN HIS SOCIETY WHICH NEVER HAPPENS TO A CLEVER WOMAN WHEN IN THE COMPANY OF A SIMPLETON OF COURSE THEN HE MUST BE CLEVER SAID DE GUICHE SIMPLY
IN ALL AFFAIRS OF THAT NATURE M
THE FIRST ONE WHO ANSWERS ME AGAIN I DO NOT KNOW I WILL DISCHARGE EVERY ONE AT THIS REMARK HURRIED OUT OF HIS APARTMENTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE OTHERS HAD FLED FROM MADAME'S APARTMENTS
WE WERE AT THE FOURTH CHANCE I THINK I CANNOT SEE A FOURTH I BEG YOUR PARDON
FOR THE LAST WEEK I HAVE BEEN PROWLING ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY AND YOU HAVE NOT ONCE DEIGNED TO NOTICE MY PRESENCE HAVE YOU BEEN PROWLING ABOUT HERE FOR A WEEK M
BUT BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE FOR IF YOU HAVE A BRANCH OF THE CHESTNUT-TREE WHICH ANNOYS YOU I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE ROUNDS OF THE LADDER IS HURTING THE SOLES OF MY FEET AND MY SHOES ARE BEING CUT THROUGH DO ME THE KINDNESS TO GIVE ME YOUR HAND WHY WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS TO DO SO THERE IS MY HAND THEN
THIS MORNING I TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE AND SHOWED MY DISSATISFACTION IN A VERY MARKED MANNER RELY UPON IT THAT IS QUITE SUFFICIENT
LOVE SUCH AS I CONCEIVE IT TO BE IS AN INCESSANT COMPLETE AND PERFECT SACRIFICE
SAINT-AIGNAN HE SAID DO YOU NOT HEAR SOME ONE MOANING YES SIRE AND WEEPING TOO IT SEEMS IT IS IN THIS DIRECTION SAID THE KING
BUT BELIEVE ME MY DEAR D'HERBLAY YOU ARE DECEIVING YOURSELF IN WHAT RESPECT THE KING WILL NEVER BECOME DEVOTED TO ME I DO NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE SAID THAT KING LOUIS WOULD EVER BECOME DEVOTED TO YOU WHY ON THE CONTRARY YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT SAID SO I DID NOT SAY THE KING
BUT IF SHE REFUSES TO TELL A FALSEHOOD,--AS SHE WILL EXPOSE HERSELF TO THE JESTS OF THE WHOLE COURT AS SHE WILL HAVE ANNOYED THE KING BY A CONFESSION AS RIDICULOUS AS IT WAS IMMODEST,--MADEMOISELLE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE WILL THINK IT BUT PROPER I SHOULD SEND HER BACK AGAIN TO HER PIGEONS IN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER THAT IN TOURAINE YONDER OR IN LE BLAISOIS,--I KNOW NOT WHERE IT MAY BE,--SHE MAY AT HER EASE STUDY SENTIMENT AND PASTORAL LIFE COMBINED THESE WORDS WERE UTTERED WITH A VEHEMENCE AND HARSHNESS THAT TERRIFIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
SO MUCH THE WORSE MADAME SAID MALICORNE EVERY ONE FOR HIMSELF IN THIS POOR WORLD MALICORNE
BUT WITHOUT LOOKING ON HE SAW AND HEARD ALL AND RAN TOWARDS THE KING WHO WITH A GESTURE DISMISSED THE SERVANT
PARDON ME MY LORD
BE EASY SAID RAOUL IT WILL NOT BE VERY LONG DE WARDES PLACED HIMSELF ON HIS GUARD
UNGRATEFUL GIRL THE YOUNG MAN LEANT WITH HIS ELBOW UPON THE WINDOW-FRAME
YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT DE GUICHE IS ONE OF OUR BEST FRIENDS WHO IS IT THEN EXCUSE ME MONSEIGNEUR LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT THE CHEVALIER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT CURIOSITY IS EXCITED IN THE SAME WAY AS THIRST BY REMOVING THAT WHICH QUENCHES IT
MADAME IN FACT IS OCCUPIED WITH THE KING THAT IS CLEAR
YOU OWE ME AS MUCH INDULGENCE AS A MADMAN DESERVES DO NOT EXAGGERATE PHILIP AND TAKE CARE HOW YOU REPRESENT YOUR WIFE TO ME AS A WOMAN OF DEPRAVED MIND BUT FACTS MOTHER FACTS WELL I AM LISTENING THIS MORNING AT TEN O'CLOCK THEY WERE PLAYING MUSIC IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS NO HARM IN THAT SURELY M
YONDER VENOMOUS REPTILE HAS RECOGNIZED US AND IS CRAWLING THIS WAY COLBERT YES
MADAME YOU ARE THE SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE OF GOODNESS AND OF COMPASSION
I HAD A HAND WHICH COULD NEVER REMAIN AT REST A HAND LIKE QUICKSILVER,--YOU KNEW ITS QUALITY FOR YOU HAVE SEEN ME AT WORK
SHE CERTAINLY IS HEEDLESS AND SINGULAR BUT PROFESSES THE BEST FEELINGS
AND WHY WHEN I SEE HIM SO UNFORTUNATE I FORGIVE HIS INFIDELITY WHICH I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HE ALSO REGRETS
AND NOW SHOW ME TO MY ROOM THE LANDLORD CAP IN HAND PRECEDED MALICORNE WHO INSTALLED HIMSELF IN HIS ROOM AND BECAME MORE AND MORE SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THAT THE LANDLORD AT EVERY ASCENT OR DESCENT LOOKED AND WINKED AT HIM IN A MANNER WHICH INDICATED THE BEST POSSIBLE INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN THEM
AND BY THE MEANS WHICH M
THE FIRST THING WHICH STRUCK THEM WAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN THE SQUARE
I AM QUITE SURE OF THAT EXCLAIMED LOUIS
BUCKINGHAM HAD HURRIED HIS DEPARTURE SO THAT THE GREATER PART OF HIS ADIEUX WERE VERY HASTILY MADE
A VERY PROPER JUDGE TO DECIDE UPON OUR DIFFERENCE OF OPINION SAID MONTALAIS
THREE MONTHS HENCE SHE WILL BE TAME ENOUGH
MANICAMP REDUCED TO THIS EXTREMITY OF NEITHER PLAYING NOR DANCING FOR A WEEK AT LEAST WAS CONSEQUENTLY VERY SAD
AND I SHALL BE LOST THERE IS NO DOUBT OF THAT
DE GUICHE THEREFORE PROMISED HIMSELF A MORE SATISFACTORY RESULT WITH RAOUL
AND GALATEA INQUIRED MADAME
HE COULD SEE M
IF I HAVE A FINE FISH I PAY FOUR OR FIVE FRANCS FOR IT
I LOVE TO SEE ONE OF MY SERVANTS IN THIS DISORDER SAID THE KING ADMIRING THE MARTIAL STAINS UPON THE CLOTHES OF HIS ENVOY
NO,--YOU SHALL NOT GO CRIED MONTALAIS STAMPING WITH HER LITTLE FOOT
GOOD-DAY SAID HE SUDDENLY ALMOST PUSHING DE GUICHE BACK INTO THE COURTYARD AGAIN
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SAID THE KING BITTERLY I PREFER THOSE PERSONS WHO EXCULPATE THEMSELVES WITHOUT INCRIMINATING OTHERS SIRE YES
AT A DISTANCE HE GAZED UPON HER LOVELY FACE UPON WHICH THE MOON SHED ITS PURE SILVERY LIGHT
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WAS PROLIFIC IN JESTS
AND SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING HIS MIND HAD BEEN SO ABSORBED WITH THIS GIRL THAT HE COULD THINK AND DREAM OF NOTHING ELSE
SUCH WAS THE PRINCE OF THAT PERIOD
I WILL RECALL HIM AND DO YOU QUESTION HIM IN YOUR TURN AGREED BUT I ASSURE YOU IT IS USELESS
WHEN I LEAVE ANY ONE WHO WEEPS AT MY ABANDONMENT I FEEL INDUCED STILL TO LOVE HIM
YOU KNOW THAT I TOLD YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT YOU ARE TO BE ALWAYS QUITE FRANK WITH ME WELL SIRE
GRISART UTTERED LOUD EXCLAMATION
HE TRIED HOWEVER TO RENDER THE CONVERSATION GENERAL AND WITH THE VIEW OF EFFECTING THIS HE REDOUBLED HIS ATTENTION AND DEVOTION TO HER
IT IS A CRIME OF HIGH TREASON I KNOW THAT A POOR GIRL LIKE MYSELF SHOULD LOVE HER SOVEREIGN AND SHOULD PRESUME TO TELL HIM SO
THE EXPENSE OF POWDER AND SULPHUR FOR FIREWORKS AMOUNTED EVERY NIGHT TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
THE CABINET PRESENTED IN FACT THE MOST PERFECT REPRESENTATION OF UNRESTRAINED PLEASURE AND AMUSEMENT
I CANNOT PERCEIVE HOW
THERE GOES ANOTHER NOTE OF A THOUSAND LIVRES
SPEAK TO M
THE KING EXCLAIMED THE QUEEN-MOTHER
YOU WISHED TO REVENGE YOURSELF I SUPPOSE BY TRYING TO MAKE MADAME MAKE A MISTAKE IN HER DANCING
MEANWHILE MAZARIN HAS FINALLY DIED AND LEFT LOUIS TO ASSUME THE REIGNS OF POWER WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF M
GOOD SAID MALICORNE TO HIMSELF RECOGNIZING HIM AT THE FIRST GLANCE
BUT THIS CANDID CONFESSION THIS PERFECTLY DISINTERESTED PREFERENCE OF ONE WHO WILL PERHAPS NEVER ATTRACT MY ATTENTION--IN ONE WORD THE MYSTERY OF THIS ADVENTURE EXCITES ME AND THE TRUTH IS THAT IF I WERE NOT SO TAKEN WITH LA VALLIERE DO NOT LET THAT INTERFERE WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S INTENTIONS
ABSENCE STILL THAT UNKIND RESOLVE BELIEVE ME SIRE I HAVE NOT FOUND IT WITHOUT A VIOLENT STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF
BUT WAIT A MINUTE
FOR I FEEL ASSURED THAT IF YOU SURVIVE THIS ENGAGEMENT YOU WILL IN THE FUTURE WORK GREAT MISCHIEF TOWARDS MY FRIENDS
THIS CROWD SPREADING JOY CONFUSION AND LIGHT WHEREVER IT PASSED WAS HERALDED IT MAY BE SAID TO THE CHATEAU BY ITS OWN CLAMOR
LA VALLIERE COULD NOT HOWEVER REFRAIN FROM A CERTAIN FEELING OF UNEASINESS
YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT COMPREHEND THIS SATISFACTION FOR YOUR RANK AND MERIT ATTRACT ATTENTION AND COMPEL REGARD NO NO SAINT-AIGNAN BELIEVE ME OR NOT AS YOU LIKE SAID THE KING LEANING FAMILIARLY UPON SAINT-AIGNAN'S ARM AND TAKING THE PATH HE THOUGHT WOULD LEAD THEM TO THE CHATEAU
ARE YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES RAISED UPON ME MERELY IN PITY
ONLY SINCE ALL HERE THINK OF THEMSELVES BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE LET US DO SO TOO PERFECTLY RIGHT BUT OF OURSELVES ONLY BE IT SO AN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE I AM READY TO SWEAR IT PUT OUT YOUR HAND THEN AND SAY ALL FOR MALICORNE ALL FOR MALICORNE AND I ALL FOR MONTALAIS REPLIED MALICORNE STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND IN HIS TURN
IN HIS WIFE'S APARTMENT MONSIEUR WAS INFORMED BY A SEMPSTRESS WHO WAS WORKING THERE THAT EVERY ONE HAD LEFT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK FOR THE PURPOSE OF BATHING IN THE SEINE THAT A GRAND FETE WAS TO BE MADE OF THE EXPEDITION THAT ALL THE CARRIAGES HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE PARK GATES AND THAT THEY HAD ALL SET OUT MORE THAN AN HOUR AGO
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT AT HER THEN SOMEWHAT ADVANCED AGE HER LONG AUBURN HAIR PERFECTLY FORMED HANDS AND BRIGHT RUBY LIPS WERE STILL THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO SAW HER
NOT AT THIS MOMENT
WHAT SHE EXCLAIMED MORE QUESTIONS STILL
LA VALLIERE FIXED A LOOK ALMOST OF INDIFFERENCE UPON THE JEWELS
NOTHING MORE SIMPLE FOR HE HAD AWAITED HIS RETURN FROM MASS WHERE HE HAD ACCOMPANIED M
AND BROUGHT IN HER TRAIN TO PARIS HALF A DOZEN MEN WHO WERE ALMOST MAD ABOUT HER AND TWO WHO WERE INDEED LITERALLY OUT OF THEIR MINDS
IN THIS MANNER SHE RULED WITH ALMOST DESPOTIC SWAY OVER THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD AND SHE WAS ALREADY PREPARING HER BATTERIES TO GOVERN WITH THE SAME ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY THE HOUSEHOLD OF HER SECOND SON
IF THE HEAVENS INSTEAD OF BEING CLOUDED AS THEY ARE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE PERFECTLY SERENE AND PROPITIOUS WE CAN STILL AFFORD TO BESTOW A FEW HOURS UPON THE OFFICER WHO HAS CONDUCTED US SO SUCCESSFULLY AND WITH SUCH EXTREME ATTENTION TO THE FRENCH COAST WHERE HE IS TO TAKE LEAVE OF US BUCKINGHAM INSTEAD OF REPLYING SEEMED TO SEEK COUNSEL FROM THE EXPRESSION OF MADAME'S FACE
MONSEIGNEUR PRAY FORGIVE MY COMING IN THIS MANNER BEFORE YOU SUMMONED ME BUT YOUR STATE ALARMS ME AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY DIE BEFORE YOU HAD SEEN ME FOR I AM BUT THE SIXTH UPON YOUR LIST THE DYING MAN STARTED AND LOOKED AT THE LIST
DE BRAGELONNE HAS PUT IT BECAUSE YOU ARE INNOCENT
YES MADAME AS MAID OF HONOR THE OLD LADY'S HEAD SANK DOWN AS IF THE BLOW HAD BEEN TOO SEVERE FOR HER
DE GUICHE HAD AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH MADAME CARRIED AWAY SUCH A WEIGHT OF HAPPINESS THAT ALL OF HIS STRENGTH OF MIND WAS HARDLY SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE HIM TO SUPPORT IT
THESE YOUNG WOMEN EASILY TAKE OFFENSE
THIS FIGURE WAS AS MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE AND SEEMED DEEPLY ENGAGED IN LOOKING AT A WINDOW ALTHOUGH ITS CURTAINS WERE CLOSELY DRAWN
BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL PERMIT ME TO SPEAK OF M
MADAME LEFT ALONE DELIGHTEDLY THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON THE KING
FOR THE QUESTION DOES NOT CONCERN YOUR OWN AFFAIRS ONLY BUT OURS ALSO
A DRYAD MADE HER APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY PURSUED BY THEM
SUGGEST A REMEDY THEN FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT A REMEDY THERE IS ONLY ONE REMEDY FOR YOU,--PAY BUT IT IS VERY UNCERTAIN WHETHER I HAVE THE MONEY
THEY WISHED TO CARRY HIM
THE DAY WILL ARRIVE--_MUST ARRIVE--WHEN I SHALL HAVE TO SAY IMPOSSIBLE SIRE AND ON THAT VERY DAY I AM A LOST MAN ARAMIS RAISED HIS SHOULDERS SLIGHTLY SAYING
AT ANY COST SHE FELT THAT SHE MUST BE REMARKED ABOVE EVERYTHING AND EVERY ONE EVEN ABOVE THE KING HIMSELF
AND MADAME CAREFULLY THOUGHT OF HERSELF WITHOUT BESTOWING A SINGLE THOUGHT UPON THE KING
I CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR PUNCTUALITY
ARAMIS GATHERED THAT HIS AUDIENCE WAS AT AN END
THE DRYAD AFFIRMS POSITIVELY CONTINUED SAINT-AIGNAN THAT THE SHEPHERDESSES WERE THREE IN NUMBER AND THAT ALL THREE WERE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WHAT WERE THEIR NAMES SAID MADAME QUICKLY
FOUQUET AND THAT M
BUT HOWEVER GREAT A WOMAN'S STRENGTH MAY BE THERE IS A LIMIT TO IT AND SHE CANNOT HOLD OUT LONG UNDER SUCH A SYSTEM
FROM THAT VERY MOMENT LOUIS XIV
JUST LOOK AT YOU ACTING THE ANCHORITE
DO NOT PITY HIM
MONTALAIS TOOK A BOOK AND OPENED IT
HAVING WALKED A FEW PACES UPON THE STRAND BUCKINGHAM SAID TO DE WARDES I THINK IT IS NOW TIME TO TAKE LEAVE OF EACH OTHER
HE ACQUITTED HIMSELF FAITHFULLY OF THE COMMISSION INTRUSTED TO HIM AND IN THE FIRST PLACE REMARKED ALL THE INDIFFERENCE AND ANNOYANCE WITH WHICH MADAME RECEIVED HER HUSBAND'S COMMUNICATION--A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH APPEARED TO HIM FRAUGHT WITH SOMETHING FRESH
IT IS HIS NEIGHBOR WHO IS AT FIFTEEN FRANCS WHICH NEIGHBOR THE OTHER SECOND BERTAUDIERE EXCUSE ME MY DEAR GOVERNOR
QUO NON ASCENDAM I HAVE RISEN SO HIGH THAT NOTHING IS LEFT ME BUT TO DESCEND FROM MY ELEVATION
DO SO SHE SAID
MONSIEUR IS LOOKING OUT FOR SOME SETS OF JEWELS AS WELL AS SINGLE STONES FOR MADAME'S TOILETTE
WITHOUT INQUIRING INTO THE DIFFERENT FEELINGS WHICH ACTUATED HIS TWO FRIENDS DE GUICHE RESOLVED TO WARD OFF THE BLOW WHICH HE FELT WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING DEALT BY ONE OF THEM AND PERHAPS BY BOTH
BUT IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED WE CAN LET YOU GO WITHOUT GREAT REGRET
I AM NOT GOING TO REMAIN ON THE TERRITORY SINCE I AM ABOUT SETTING OFF FOR ENGLAND
DE WARDES TURNED ROUND AND SAW THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WHO HAVING PROBABLY REMAINED BEHIND WITH THAT INTENTION HAD JUST APPROACHED HIM
WHY FIFTEEN FRANCS FOR HIM AND ONLY THREE FRANCS FOR POOR SELDON THE DISTINCTION MADE IN THAT INSTANCE WAS A TRULY NOBLE ACT AND ONE WHICH DISPLAYED THE KING'S GOODNESS OF HEART TO GREAT ADVANTAGE THE KING'S YOU SAY THE CARDINAL'S I MEAN
BESIDES WE WILL NOW TRY THE EXPERIMENT FOR WHICH WE CAME OUT
FOUQUET HAS NO MORE MONEY IN MATTERS OF FINANCE MY DEAR MARGUERITE SOME ARE WITHOUT MONEY TO-DAY WHO TO-MORROW CAN PROCURE MILLIONS THAT MIGHT BE M
LOUISE ONE WORD I BEG BUT M
THE SOFT LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINED THE WINDOWS WAS THE COUNT'S STAR
SINCE IF I HAD WISHED TO MAKE THE QUEEN A PRESENT OF THEM I HAD NO NEED OF HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE MADAME CAST A SIDE GLANCE UPON THE BRACELETS WHICH IN THEIR CASKET WERE DAZZLINGLY EXPOSED TO VIEW UPON A TABLE CLOSE BESIDE HER
HE CAUTIOUSLY APPROACHED THE OPENING AND LISTENED THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH GRIEF HAVING AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY
IN THAT CASE SAID MALICORNE IMITATING HIS GESTURE AND HIS MYSTERIOUS LOOK IF HE HAS NOT GIVEN YOU HIS NAME YOU UNDERSTAND HE MUST HAVE HIS REASONS FOR IT OH OF COURSE AND THEREFORE I HIS FRIEND HIS CONFIDANT MUST NOT BETRAY HIM YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT MONSIEUR SAID THE LANDLORD AND I DO NOT INSIST UPON IT I APPRECIATE YOUR DELICACY
DE MANICAMP WAS A GULF
THE KING WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF TEMPER ABOUT THE MATTER
THAT BUCKINGHAM WAS ONLY A PRETEXT AND THAT GUICHE IS THE ONE WHO IS REALLY TO BLAME IN THE MATTER ANNE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
BUT YOU ARE PALE NO I AM PERFECTLY WELL SO MUCH THE BETTER
NO MADAME DESIRED SIMPLY TO PUNISH THE KING FOR HAVING AVAILED HIMSELF OF SECRET MEANS ALTOGETHER FEMININE IN THEIR NATURE
THE SPIRIT OF THIS COURAGEOUS WOMAN SOON RESUMED ITS ENERGY NO LONGER OVERWHELMED BY INDULGENCE IN COMPASSIONATE LAMENTATIONS
TEN YEARS LATER CAN SIMILARLY REFER TO THE WHOLE BOOK OR THE SECOND VOLUME OF THE FOUR-VOLUME EDITION
AND YOU ARE RIGHT TOO FOR THE THING IS AMUSING ENOUGH
SHE EVEN SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ALL POWER OF THOUGHT
ITS WEIGHT IS ITS ONLY ADVANTAGE THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT
SO SMILING AS A MAN WOULD DO FOR WHOM WHATEVER MIGHT BE DONE WAS BUT SIMPLY HIS DUE HE SAID MY DEAR HOST I SHALL TAKE THE BEST AND THE GAYEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE WITH A STABLE YES WITH A STABLE AND WHEN WILL YOU TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY IF IT BE POSSIBLE QUITE SO BUT SAID MALICORNE I SHALL LEAVE THE LARGE ROOM UNOCCUPIED FOR THE PRESENT VERY GOOD SAID THE LANDLORD WITH AN AIR OF INTELLIGENCE
SHE INDEED WHOSE DISPOSITION WAS THE MOST LIVELY,--MONTALAIS FOR INSTANCE,--WAS THE FIRST TO YIELD TO THE INFLUENCE
HE THEN TRIED TO SEE M
BUT AT LEAST I WILL DO FOR YOUR PROTEGE WHAT YOU REFUSE TO PERMIT ME TO DO FOR YOU YOUR MAJESTY ENCOURAGES ME
BUT IT WAS NOT EXPECTED THAT YOUR LADYSHIP WOULD LEAVE FOR BELLIERE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALL MY JEWELS AND ARTICLES OF VALUE THEN ARE PACKED UP YES MADAME
YOU HAVE YOURSELF ALWAYS ADMIRED ME FOR MY EVENNESS OF TEMPER WELL THEN IT IS SAID THAT--NO I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL YOU DO NOT LET US TALK ABOUT IT THEN SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE WHO DETECTED THE ILL-NATURE THAT WAS CONCEALED BY ALL THESE PREFACES YET FELT THE MOST ANXIOUS CURIOSITY ON THE SUBJECT
HE IS CONFINED TO HIS BED THE DEUCE
THE DUKE RECEIVED HIS ADVERSARY AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE MADE ROOM BESIDE HIM ON THE SAME SEAT WITH HIMSELF OFFERED HIM REFRESHMENTS AND SPREAD OVER HIS KNEES THE SABLE CLOAK THAT HAD BEEN THROWN ON THE FRONT SEAT
FOUQUET SO VERY MUCH I THINK HE DOES NOT LIKE HIM
THAT IT IS AN ABYSS I AM AWARE BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE FOR I SHALL PURSUE MY OWN COURSE THIS IS MADNESS DE GUICHE
I HAD A HUNTING-KNIFE MADE OF IT WHICH WILL LAST A HUNDRED YEARS YET
I HAVE ADDED HOW HAPPY I SHOULD BE TO RENDER HER ANY SERVICE IN MY POWER AND HAVE SIGNED FOUQUET AT THE END OF THE LETTER AND HAS ANY ONE OFFERED RESISTANCE ONE PERSON ONLY REPLIED FOUQUET
CHAPTER XXVII
HIS DOMESTICS PERCEIVED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HE APPROACHED HIS CARRIAGE THAT THEIR MASTER WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF HUMORS
VERY WELL VERY WELL SAID THE CHEVALIER TO HIMSELF I MUST WAIT FOR DE WARDES
WOULD YOUR DEPARTURE GAINSAY ANY ONE OF YOUR CHERISHED THOUGHTS IF I WERE TO SAY YES WOULD YOU BEGIN TO TAKE YOUR MISFORTUNE PATIENTLY HOW CRUEL YOU ARE TAKE CARE SIRE
COLBERT HAD AMASSED FOUR MILLIONS OF FRANCS AND DISPERSED THEM WITH SLEEPLESS ECONOMY
AS HE TRAVELED ALONG HE MARSHALED HIS ARGUMENTS IN THE MOST BECOMING MANNER
THE WAVE ASCENDED TO HIS WAIST BUT DID NOT MOVE HIM
WHAT IS YOUR HIGHNESS'S PLEASURE SAID THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS TIMIDLY
IT WAS BY THESE MEANS THAT A RAPID AND SPLENDID FORTUNE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
DE GUICHE WORE A COSTUME OF FRENCH-GRAY VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER AND TRIMMED WITH BLUE RIBBONS
I ENTREAT YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR MY TRANSPORT
ATHENAIS THEREUPON ARRANGED HER DRESS SO AS TO PREVENT ITS RUSTLING BEING HEARD
FOR TO ANYBODY BUT MYSELF EACH PRISONER WOULD BRING IN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PISTOLES
BELLE-ISLE HAS A DOUBLE ENCEINTE A CITADEL TWO DETACHED FORTS
I DO NOT SEE FIVE FRANCS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM YOU UNDERSTAND
LOUIS CALLS D'ARTAGNAN OUT OF RETIREMENT AND SENDS HIM TO INVESTIGATE THE ISLAND PROMISING HIM A TREMENDOUS SALARY AND HIS LONG-PROMISED PROMOTION TO CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS UPON HIS RETURN
DE WARDES SINCE THE AFFAIR OF THE BARRICADE HAD TREATED RAOUL AS A STRANGER
HE ADVANCED CAUTIOUSLY AND FOUND HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN
MOTHER CRIED LOUISE
MONSTER SAID SHE
IF INDEED I AM NOT REALLY OUT OF MY SENSES IS OR IS NOT THAT WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW YOU ARE BY NO MEANS OUT OF YOUR SENSES FOR IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE I DID SAY ALL THAT JUST NOW AND WHY DID YOU SAY SO BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO SPEAK IN THIS MANNER OF THRONES BEING CAST DOWN AND KINGS BEING RAISED UP WHEN ONE IS ONE'S SELF FAR ABOVE ALL KINGS AND THRONES OF THIS WORLD AT LEAST YOUR POWER IS INFINITE THEN CRIED FOUQUET
THE HEDGE THE CROSS-PATHS AND LABYRINTH I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEM ALL
IT IS A LOVELY COUNTRY MADAME REPLIED THE DUKE
SHE IS NOW ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE
AND YOU MADEMOISELLE
IN THIRTY-FOUR HOURS TIME I SHALL BE AT CALAIS
BY THE TIME MADAME ARRIVED AT PARIS SHE HAD REDUCED TO SLAVERY ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND LOVERS
MADAME HAD WISELY CALCULATED HER VENGEANCE AND IT HAS BEEN SEEN ALSO IN WHAT MANNER SHE CARRIED IT OUT
IN ANOTHER PART WERE MADAME SEATED UPON SOME CUSHIONS ON THE FLOOR AND DE GUICHE ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER SPREADING OUT A HANDFUL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES WHILE THE PRINCESS WITH HER WHITE AND SLENDER FINGERS POINTED OUT SUCH AMONG THEM AS PLEASED HER THE MOST
I AM UNEASY ON THE DUKE'S ACCOUNT REPLIED BRAGELONNE
THERE IS NO SECRET THERE MURMURED THE FRANCISCAN IT IS A PLOT
FROM THE HOTEL OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TO THAT OF THE COMTE DE GRAMONT NOTHING BUT MIRACLES WAS ATTEMPTED
THE MARQUISE ENTERED THIS SOMEWHAT EXTRAORDINARY VEHICLE SITTING OPPOSITE THE CLERK WHO ENDEAVORED TO PUT HIS KNEES OUT OF THE WAY AFRAID EVEN OF TOUCHING THE MARQUISE'S DRESS
THE WEIGHT OF THE CHEST WAS SO GREAT THAT THE CLERK WAS OBLIGED TO GET THE COACHMAN TO ASSIST HIM WITH IT
D'ARTAGNAN INJURED YOUR FATHER HE RENDERED OR AT LEAST DID ALL THAT HE COULD TO RENDER A GREAT SERVICE TO MINE DE WARDES WAS THUNDERSTRUCK
FOUQUET HAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE THERE INQUIRED THE KING
COLBERT AND MYSELF
PRAY REMEMBER THAT IT IS A CRIME TO BETRAY A WOMAN'S NAME FROM WHICH A WOMAN ABSOLVES YOU COMTE ON THE CONDITION THAT YOU WILL REVEAL THE NAMES OF THE SHEPHERDESSES THEIR NAMES WERE PHYLLIS AMARYLLIS AND GALATEA EXCEEDINGLY WELL!--THEY HAVE NOT LOST BY THE DELAY SAID MADAME AND NOW WE HAVE THREE CHARMING NAMES
GRANTED WITH DIFFICULTY AND AFTER AN INTERVAL
RISE MONSIEUR AND RENDER US THE SERVICE WE REQUEST OF YOU I OBEY YOUR MAJESTY SAID MALICORNE LEADING THE WAY UP THE STAIRCASE
ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD BEGGED THE YOUNG QUEEN TO PAY HER A VISIT
HORSES ARE BEING SADDLED OR HARNESSED TO THE CARRIAGES--THE QUEEN'S MULES OR MADAME'S FOUR WHITE PONIES
HIS JOINTS ARE KEPT WELL GREASED THE GREATEST CARE IS BEING TAKEN CARE OF HIM WITH REGARD TO THE FOOD HE EATS AND THE WINES HE DRINKS
BUT TO INJURE MYSELF GRATUITOUSLY IS REALLY VERY FOOLISH OF ME
MY OPINION IS IT WILL BE LONGER THAN EVER
RAOUL FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF HIS GLANCE AND NOTICED THAT DE GUICHE AND D'ARTAGNAN SALUTED EACH OTHER BUT HE COULD NOT DISTINGUISH AT WHOM THE CAPTAIN'S LINGERING AND HAUGHTY GLANCE WAS AIMED
THE LIEUTENANT IS VISITING THE POST ON THE BASTIONS
YOU CANNOT DENY TOO THAT EVERY MORNING SHE TELLS YOU HOW INDIFFERENTLY SHE SLEPT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT TRUE DE WARDES QUITE TRUE
IT IS BY INTEREST YOU MUST GAIN THEM OVER AND ANNE OF AUSTRIA ADOPTED THIS PLAN
OH IT IS JUST SO I DOUBT IT AND I SWEAR IT COXCOMB AND THEN THAT IS NOT THE TRUE REASON
AND AS ALL THAT IS DONE HERE IS UNDER YOUR ADVICE YOU WILL BESTOW THE LAST GLANCE UPON MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE RAOUL WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO NEITHER SEEKS NOR FEARS A QUARREL BOWED HIS HEAD IN TOKEN OF ASSENT AND SEATED HIMSELF UPON A BENCH IN THE SUN
BUT THAT SERVICE IS NO LONGER IN FASHION
THEN TAKING HOLD OF ARAMIS'S HAND HE DREW HIM TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED
I WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER EXPRESSION FROM THEM IT IS NOT I WHO AM SAD MONSIEUR
A WOMAN ADMITS THE MUSICIANS IT IS MONTALAIS HUSH MONSEIGNEUR
THEY ARE YOUNG AND THERE IS TIME ENOUGH BUT DEAR ME SAID PHILIP LAUGHING I PERCEIVE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE BEST PART OF THE AFFAIR NO THAT BY WHICH THE KING WAS MOST DEEPLY TOUCHED THE KING DO YOU SAY HAS BEEN DEEPLY TOUCHED TO THE VERY QUICK OF HIS HEART BUT HOW?--IN WHAT MANNER?--TELL ME DIRECTLY BY AN ADVENTURE THE ROMANCE OF WHICH CANNOT BE EQUALLED YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE TO HEAR OF SUCH ADVENTURES AND YET YOU KEEP ME WAITING SAID THE PRINCESS IMPATIENTLY
I INTEND TO HAVE A LOTTERY THIS EVENING AND SHALL EXPECT TO SEE YOU I HAVE HEARD SAID THE YOUNG QUEEN WITH A SORT OF TIMID REPROACH THAT YOUR MAJESTY INTENDS TO PUT IN THE LOTTERY THOSE LOVELY BRACELETS WHOSE RARITY IS SO GREAT THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW THEM TO PASS OUT OF THE CUSTODY OF THE CROWN EVEN WERE THERE NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT THEY HAD ONCE BELONGED TO YOU MY DAUGHTER SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA WHO READ THE YOUNG QUEEN'S THOUGHTS AND WISHED TO CONSOLE HER FOR NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE BRACELETS AS A PRESENT IT IS POSITIVELY NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD INDUCE MADAME TO PASS HER TIME IN MY APARTMENTS MADAME SAID THE YOUNG QUEEN BLUSHING
BESIDES CONTINUED THE KING NO POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION CAN BE MADE WHICH WOULD BE TO YOUR DISCREDIT
IN A WORD SIRE MY PLAN WHICH I CONFESS I AM SURPRISED TO FIND YOU DISPUTE IS MISCHIEVOUS TO JEALOUS PEOPLE IT IS TRUE
NAY ON THE CONTRARY FOR I DRAW MY SWORD SAID BUCKINGHAM UNSHEATHING IT AS HE SPOKE
DO NOT LET THAT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE MONSEIGNEUR
WHAT CAN THIS MALICORNE WANT WITH ME THOUGHT RAOUL
AND YOU PLACE YOURSELF ON THE LIST OF CANDIDATES MONSEIGNEUR I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT THE ORDER REQUIRED TO BECOME POSSESSED OF A GREAT STATE SECRET AND KNOWING THAT FROM MODESTY YOU HAD IN ANTICIPATION RESIGNED YOUR FUNCTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE THE DEPOSITARY OF SUCH A SECRET I WROTE TO SAY THAT I WAS READY TO COMPETE POSSESSING ALONE A SECRET I BELIEVE TO BE IMPORTANT SPEAK SAID THE FRANCISCAN
YOU KNOW THAT WE ALREADY OBSERVED SOMETHING RESPECTING THAT MAD FELLOW BUCKINGHAM DO NOT SAY ANYTHING AGAINST MADAME MONSEIGNEUR OR I SHALL TAKE MY LEAVE
WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO BE GAY I MAKE YOU LAUGH
IT IS PAUSED SAINT-AIGNAN AMIDST A FLATTERING MURMUR OF APPLAUSE IT IS WITH LADIES FAIR ESPECIALLY THAT THE QUALITIES OF THIS KING OF THE SHEPHERDS ARE MOST PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED
WHY DID YOU ASK ME FOR AN INTERVIEW AT SUCH AN HOUR AND IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS I STIMULATED YOUR GRATITUDE IN REMINDING YOU THAT IT WAS I WHO HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF YOUR BECOMING ATTACHED TO MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD
WITH THE KING HER CHARACTER WAS THAT OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER WITH PHILIP SHE WAS SIMPLY THE MOTHER
WHEREUPON THEY WERE TOLD THAT THE OLD OFFICERS HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A FRIEND OF M
HER ROYAL HAND REMAINED SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AND WHEN RAOUL HAD LEFT IT SANK WITHOUT ANGER BUT NOT WITHOUT EMOTION IN THAT OF DE GUICHE
MALICORNE WHOM YOU SEE HERE SAID DE GUICHE TO DE WARDES IS A VERY EXCELLENT FELLOW WHOSE ONLY MISFORTUNE IS THAT OF NOT BEING OF GENTLE BIRTH
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT MONSIEUR WHO WAS PRETENTIOUS ENOUGH TO FANCY HE COULD ECLIPSE A STAR EVEN IF A STAR HAD ADORNED ITSELF IN A SIMILAR MANNER TO HIMSELF WAS ON THE CONTRARY COMPLETELY ECLIPSED IN ALL IMAGINATIONS WHICH ARE SILENT JUDGES CERTAINLY BUT VERY POSITIVE AND FIRM IN THEIR CONVICTIONS
YOUR QUESTION IS A SUFFICIENT ANSWER FOR ME
OH SAID MADAME YOURS IS A SMILE WHICH PORTENDS NO GOOD TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN
THE QUEEN SAID BANOS WHICH MEANS BATHS I REPEAT PHILIP SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA THAT YOUR SISTER IS CHILDISHLY JEALOUS IN THAT CASE MADAME REPLIED THE PRINCE I TOO MUST WITH GREAT HUMILITY ACCUSE MYSELF OF POSSESSING THE SAME DEFECT YOU ALSO PHILIP CERTAINLY ARE YOU REALLY JEALOUS OF THESE BATHS AND WHY NOT MADAME WHEN THE KING GOES TO THE BATHS WITH MY WIFE AND DOES NOT TAKE THE QUEEN
AND A DEEP SIGH ACCOMPANIED THE EXCLAMATION
THE DEUCE
THE DEUCE
D'ARTAGNAN WHO HOWEVER BEING ENGAGED IN THE ORGANIZATION OF A MILITARY HOUSEHOLD FOR THE KING COULD NOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE
BUT THE TIME OF THE COMPANION WHOM I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME IS VALUABLE AND AS FONTAINEBLEAU IS ON THE WAY TO HIS DIOCESE WHO IS IT THEN THE BISHOP OF VANNES WHOSE APPOINTMENT YOUR MAJESTY AT MY RECOMMENDATION DEIGNED THREE MONTHS SINCE TO SIGN THAT IS VERY POSSIBLE SAID THE KING WHO HAD SIGNED WITHOUT READING
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WORKED LOUIS WENT FROM THE TABLE TO THE WINDOW INASMUCH AS THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT UPON MADAME'S PAVILION
IN SEEING YOU I FORGOT I HURRIED HERE EXPRESSLY TO TELL YOU OF IT
THE NEXT DAY OR RATHER THE SAME DAY FOR THE EVENTS WE HAVE JUST DESCRIBED WERE CONCLUDED ONLY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST WAS SERVED AND AS THE KING WAS PREPARING TO GO TO MASS WITH THE TWO QUEENS
IT AROSE FROM AN EXCESS OF AFFECTION BUT I CAN PROVE TO YOU THAT I LOVE YOU MORE THAN EVER BY RESPECTING YOU AS MUCH AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY DESIRE OR DESERVE THEN BENDING BEFORE HER AND TAKING HER BY THE HAND HE SAID TO HER WILL YOU HONOR ME BY ACCEPTING THE KISS I PRESS UPON YOUR HAND AND THE KING'S LIPS WERE PRESSED RESPECTFULLY AND LIGHTLY UPON THE YOUNG GIRL'S TREMBLING HAND
THE COURTYARD OF THE HOTEL GRAMMONT
MADEMOISELLE WHY HAVE I NOT A DEVOTED SISTER OR A TRUE FRIEND SUCH AS YOURSELF YOU HAVE FRIENDS MONSIEUR DE GUICHE AND THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE OF WHOM YOU SPOKE JUST NOW IS I BELIEVE ONE OF THE MOST DEVOTED YES YES YOU ARE RIGHT HE IS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
I HAVE CERTAIN VIEWS FOR DE BRAGELONNE
AS HE WAS BATHING HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO COMPARE THE WHITENESS OF HIS BODY WITH THAT OF THE COURTIERS AND THANKS TO THE CARE WHICH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TOOK OF HIMSELF NO ONE NOT EVEN THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WAS ABLE TO STAND THE COMPARISON
BUT ASK ME FOR NO MORE APPOINTMENTS FOR THERE ARE NONE TO GIVE AWAY AH EXCLAIMED THE CHEVALIER MIDDAY ALREADY THAT IS THE HOUR FIXED FOR THE DEPARTURE YOU DISMISS ME MONSIEUR INQUIRED GUICHE
MOREOVER WAS NOT HER VANITY EVER PRESENT THAT EVIL INFLUENCE WHICH PLAYS SO IMPORTANT A PART IN THAT COMEDY OF DRAMATIC INCIDENTS CALLED THE LIFE OF A WOMAN
THE DUKE'S ATTENDANTS HAD RECEIVED DIRECTIONS TO HAVE A BOAT IN READINESS AT THE JETTY HEAD AND TO WATCH THE EMBARKATION OF THEIR MASTER WITHOUT APPROACHING HIM UNTIL EITHER HE OR HIS FRIEND SHOULD SUMMON THEM,--"WHATEVER MAY HAPPEN HE HAD ADDED LAYING A STRESS UPON THESE WORDS SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE MISUNDERSTOOD
FOR MY PART AND I SPEAK AS I THINK I SHOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE RUN THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED ALIVE BY SOME WILD ANIMAL THAN TO HAVE BEEN LISTENED TO AND OVERHEARD
YES YOU ARE ALWAYS COMPROMISING ME MONSIEUR MALICORNE
MONSIEUR CRIED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY WITH AN EXPLOSION OF HILARITY MONSIEUR IS YOUR PROTECTOR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT IS SAID SO EXCLAIMED THE KING
YOUR MAJESTY SAID BUCKINGHAM RESPECTFULLY DESIRED TO SPEAK TO ME YES DUKE SAID THE QUEEN IN ENGLISH
YOUR WORDS ALMOST FRIGHTEN ME FROM THEIR WANT OF MEANING
SO THAT IF IT WERE NOT FOR MY LITTLE ESTATE AT MONTLEZUN WHICH BRINGS ME IN TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I COULD NOT HAVE MET MY ENGAGEMENTS WELL THEN HOW ABOUT THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS FROM THE BASTILE
SO THAT BEHIND THE FOREGROUND OF THE SCENES COULD BE SEEN AS A BACKGROUND THE BEAUTIFUL SKY GLITTERING WITH STARS
THE TWO QUEENS WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE OBSERVED HIS ARRIVAL SO COMPLETELY WERE THEY OCCUPIED IN THEIR ILL-NATURED REMARKS HAD NOT MADAME NOTICED THAT ALL AT ONCE LA VALLIERE WHO WAS STANDING UP FACING THE GALLERY EXHIBITED CERTAIN SIGNS OF CONFUSION AND THEN SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE COURTIERS WHO SURROUNDED HER WHO IMMEDIATELY DISPERSED
HE WAS IN FACT MORE AFFECTIONATE AND IT MIGHT BE MORE EFFEMINATE THAN THE KING
AND IT MIGHT POSSIBLY HAPPEN THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE NYMPH OF THE WATERS MIGHT BE AMONG THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU HAVE NOT STUDIED OF COURSE SIRE REPLIED MADAME FOR FACTS OF THAT NATURE ONE DOES NOT ALTOGETHER RELY UPON ONE'S SELF ALONE
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PERSONS HAD BEEN INVITED AND EACH OF THEM WAS ANXIOUS TO LEARN WHETHER HIS OR HER NAME WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE NUMBER OF PRIVILEGED NAMES
NAY DO NOT INTERRUPT ME
AND TO THE PHYSICIAN TO GRISART YES HE IS HERE THEN HE IS WAITING WITH THE POTION HE PROMISED VERY WELL
EVERY TIME YOUR MAJESTY DIRECTED THE BANKS OF THE GRAND CANAL TO BE ILLUMINATED AS MUCH OIL WAS CONSUMED AS THERE WAS WATER IN THE BASINS WELL WELL M
DO AS YOU THINK PROPER
COME TRY AND THINK
SING IT TO ME AND I SHALL MAKE ITS ACQUAINTANCE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW IT BEGINS
THE SHARE THAT THE COMTE DE LA FERE HAD HAD IN THE RESTORATION OF CHARLES II
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN
AS I HAD MY OWN READY I REMAINED BEHIND
THE FORMER FROM CALCULATED THE LATTER FROM NATURAL MOTIVES
SIX LEAGUES I BELIEVE SIX LEAGUES
YOU ARE SPEAKING VERY HEEDLESSLY NO NO
DE MONTESPAN MURMURED THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL
YES YES
YES YES
YES YES
YES YES
YES YES
ETEXT 1258--FIRST 104 CHAPTERS OF THE THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
WHAT IS THE MATTER ASK MY SISTER-IN-LAW RATHER WHO JUST NOW WAS DETAILING ALL HER GRIEVANCES TO YOU HER GRIEVANCES WHAT YES I WAS LISTENING
BECAUSE THE ENGLISH ARE HER COUNTRYMEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXPENDED LARGE SUMS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPANY HER TO FRANCE AND BECAUSE IT WOULD HARDLY BE POLITE NOT POLITIC CERTAINLY--TO DISMISS ABRUPTLY THOSE MEMBERS OF THE ENGLISH NOBILITY WHO HAVE NOT SHRUNK FROM ANY DEVOTION OR SACRIFICE A WONDERFUL SACRIFICE INDEED RETURNED PHILIP TO DESERT A WRETCHED COUNTRY TO COME TO A BEAUTIFUL ONE WHERE A GREATER EFFECT CAN BE PRODUCED FOR A GUINEA THAT CAN BE PROCURED ELSEWHERE FOR FOUR
HE INWARDLY FELT THAT A GAME IMPORTANT IN ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WAS BEING PLAYED AT THAT MOMENT
AS FOR MONSIEUR WHO HAD LAUGHED AT THE TWO STORIES WITHOUT COMPREHENDING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM HE TURNED TOWARDS DE GUICHE AND SAID TO HIM WELL COMTE YOU SAY NOTHING
COLBERT'S SMILE WAS A PRESAGE OF HOSTILITY
OH OH HE SAID YOU WANT ME TO INTRODUCE YOU INTO THE ROOMS OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR YES YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I CANNOT DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND WITHOUT BEING MADE ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR OBJECT UNFORTUNATELY MY DEAR MONSIEUR MALICORNE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GIVE YOU ANY EXPLANATION
SHE COULD NOT ENJOY A MOMENT'S REPOSE UNTIL SHE HAD MET THE KING
INSTEAD OF DUELING THE FOUR ARE ATTACKED BY FIVE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDS AND THE COURAGE OF THE YOUTH IS MADE APPARENT DURING THE BATTLE
THE WHOLE OF THE COURT THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE FAVORITES AND MORE INTIMATE ASSOCIATES AND THEY WERE NUMEROUS SINCE THERE WERE ALREADY FIVE MASTERS WERE ASSEMBLED IN THE EVENING FOR THE REPETITION OF THE BALLET
AND HAD SHE ONE IT WOULD NOT BE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
HER PERFIDIOUS FRIEND'S VOICE HAD ASSUMED THE MOST AFFECTIONATE TONE
BUT WE HAVE NOW BEEN WALKING FOR SOME TIME SHALL WE BE LONG BEFORE WE REACH IT ABOUT FIFTY OR SIXTY PACES FURTHER
I WOULD WILLINGLY RISK AND LOSE MY LIFE IN AN ENCOUNTER AGAINST MEN HE SAID GLANCING AT BRAGELONNE BUT AS TO FIGHTING WITH OARS AGAINST WAVES I HAVE NO TASTE FOR THAT AND FOR MYSELF SAID MANICAMP EVEN WERE I TO SUCCEED IN REACHING THE SHIPS I SHOULD NOT BE INDIFFERENT TO THE LOSS OF THE ONLY GOOD DRESS WHICH I HAVE LEFT,--SALT WATER WOULD SPOIL IT YOU THEN REFUSE ALSO EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE
MALICORNE NOT IN THE LEAST
HAVE YOU QUITE GIVEN YOURSELF UP TO THE PLEASURES OF THE COURT I HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN THE MARRIAGE FETES WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOURSELF THEN I AM GETTING READY TO LEAVE FOR BELLIERE FOR BELLIERE YES YOU ARE BECOMING RUSTIC IN YOUR TASTES THEN
SINCE YOU ARE SO DEVOTED TO ME I SHALL TAKE YOU WITH ME ANYWHERE MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED DE GUICHE IN A JOYOUS TONE WHENEVER YOU LIKE AND AT ONCE TOO
YOU SEE THE STORM HAS NOT PASSED AWAY IT IS A WARNING SIRE THE KING SMILED
THE ADMIRAL AS WE HAVE SEEN WAS DETERMINED TO PAY NO FURTHER ATTENTION TO BUCKINGHAM'S THREATENING GLANCES AND FITS OF PASSION
WHEN IT CAME TO DE GUICHE'S TURN THE KING SAID AH
YOU WILL NOT THINK ANY MORE OF THE PAST WILL YOU
A MORE LITERAL TRANSLATION WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS
IT IS WORTH SEVENTEEN MILLIONS OF LIVRES
LA VALLIERE ROSE FROM HER SEAT LIKE A DEAD PERSON GALVANIZED AND THEN FELL BACK IN HER ARMCHAIR
THE DUKE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO CARRY HIS LATE ANTAGONIST TOWARDS THE SHORE
IT WAS THAT OF THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE
IT IS DANGEROUS TO PREFER THE LEAST FREQUENTED PATHS AND NO LONGER BE AMUSED WITH SUCH DIVERSIONS AS GLADDEN YOUNG GIRLS HEARTS
ADIEU MONSIEUR GRISART
ADIEU MONSIEUR GRISART
WHICH HE COULD NEITHER FEIGN NOR CONCEAL AND THEIR CONCLUSION WAS THAT DE GUICHE WAS NOT ACTING THE PART OF A FLATTERER
WHY HUSH SAID ARAMIS INVOLUNTARILY CLENCHING HIS WHITE HAND
THE SMALLER ROOM MIGHT EITHER SHELTER MANICAMP FOR A TIME WHO IS DE GUICHE'S CONFIDANT AND WOULD BE THE VIGILANT KEEPER OF THE DOOR OR DE GUICHE HIMSELF ACTING FOR GREATER SAFETY THE PART OF A MASTER AND CONFIDANT AT THE SAME TIME
IS IT HOWEVER NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD INFORM RAOUL SPARE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND ANNOYANCE
AT THE VERY SAME MOMENT A TRAVELER WRAPPED IN A LARGE SPANISH CLOAK APPEARED AT THE PORCH NEAR ENOUGH TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION
IN VERY TRUTH HE WHOM SUCH VAST INTERESTS SUMMONED AND WHOM SO MANY WOMEN SMILED UPON INVITINGLY HAD SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING CONSECRATED EVERY MOMENT OF HIS TIME EVERY THROB OF HIS HEART TO THIS SOLE DREAM
ARAMIS LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT AS THE ANGEL OF HUMAN DESTINIES MIGHT HAVE LOOKED UPON A SIMPLE MORTAL
THE KING AND PRINCESS LOOKED GLOOMILY AT THIS SCENE AS SPECTATORS OF MATURER AGE LOOK ON AT THE GAMES OF LITTLE CHILDREN
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING AND I SAID THE VALET POCKETING THE PURSE HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING THE CHEVALIER BEING NOW CERTAIN THAT GUICHE HAD ENTERED RETURNED TO THE PRINCE WHOM HE FOUND SPLENDIDLY DRESSED AND RADIANT WITH JOY AS WITH GOOD LOOKS
IS THE MAN WHOSE CREDIT IS SO POWERFUL AND WHOSE PROMISES ARE AS GOOD AS DEEDS MONSIEUR MALICORNE MALICORNE BOWED
HOW DID YOU EXECUTE MY COMMISSION INQUIRED FOUQUET
THE KING'S SECRET
NAY SO MUCH SO INDEED THAT SHE DID NOT EVEN ANSWER ME WHEN I ADDRESSED HER
FOUQUET WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PERSON WHOM THE CHEVALIER NOW SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME
SHE HAS ALLOWED EVERY ONE TO PASS BY HER THROUGH FEAR OF HER DEFECT BEING REMARKED WELL SHE WILL NOT RUN SO FAST AS DAPHNE AND WILL NOT BE AS ABLE TO ESCAPE APOLLO HENRIETTA SAID THE KING OUT OF TEMPER
WHILE THE LATTER LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR TOOK A FEW SIPS OF WINE FROM HIS GLASS WITH THE AIR OF A CONNOISSEUR
IT IS PART OF MY DUTY TO WATCH OVER YOUR HOUSEHOLD AS OVER THAT OF THE HUMBLEST OF MY SUBJECTS
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT DURING THE LAST TEN DAYS HE HAS NEVER LEFT HER SIDE IF THEY WERE DOING ANY HARM THEY WOULD HIDE THEMSELVES VERY GOOD EXCLAIMED THE DUKE I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY THAT
DE BAISEMEAUX I TOLD HIM CONTINUED THE GOVERNOR NOT PERCEIVING HIS OWN THOUGHTLESSNESS
THE DUKE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER SEINE WHICH FOLDS FRANCE A THOUSAND TIMES IN ITS LOVING EMBRACE BEFORE DECIDING UPON JOINING ITS WATERS WITH THE OCEAN
DE MANICAMP WITH HIS TACT AND TALENT HAD CREATED HIMSELF A REVENUE IN THE OPULENT FAMILY OF THE CELEBRATED MARECHAL
SAINT-AIGNAN'S EYES FELL UPON THE SIGNATURE
IT WAS INDEED EITHER TOO MUCH OR NOT SUFFICIENT
HE WAS EVEN TOO FAR REMOVED FROM THAT BARRIER TO PERCEIVE ITS EXISTENCE
SHALL I SEND FOR A CONFESSOR BELONGING TO THE ORDER OF JESUITS YES IMMEDIATELY IT WILL BE IMAGINED THAT AT THE SIGN OF THE CROSS WHICH THEY HAD EXCHANGED THE LANDLORD AND THE INVALID MONK HAD RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS TWO AFFILIATED MEMBERS OF THE WELL-KNOWN SOCIETY OF JESUS
FROM THE VERY MOMENT YOU RESTORE IT WITH SO KIND AN ASSURANCE OF ITS EXISTENCE I HAVE NO LONGER ANY OTHER IDEA IN MY HEAD THE DUKE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS IF HE MEANT TO SAY
YOU ARE PREJUDGING THE CASE THE SIGHS YOU SPOKE OF JUST NOW ARE MORE THAN INDICATIONS YOU OVERWHELM ME SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN SUDDENLY AS IF COLLECTING HER WHOLE STRENGTH LIKE A WRESTLER PREPARING FOR A LAST STRUGGLE
IT WAS SHE WHO RELATED THE PARTICULARS TO ME AND I HAVE REPEATED THEM AND NOW YOU HAVE FINISHED MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN HAVE YOU NOT SAID MADAME WITH A SMILE THAT MADE THE KING TREMBLE
THE MANIA OF SELLING HIS NEW CLOTHES FOR A QUARTER OF WHAT THEY WERE WORTH HAD RENDERED OUR HERO SUFFICIENTLY CELEBRATED IN ORLEANS A CITY WHERE IN GENERAL WE SHOULD BE PUZZLED TO SAY WHY HE CAME TO PASS HIS DAYS OF PENITENCE
AND THAT A SERIOUS ONE YOUR MAJESTY ALARMS ME--AND YET I WAS MOST CONFIDENT IN YOUR JUSTICE AND GOODNESS DO YOU KNOW I AM TOLD MONSIEUR FOUQUET THAT YOU ARE PREPARING A GRAND FETE AT VAUX FOUQUET SMILED AS A SICK MAN WOULD DO AT THE FIRST SHIVER OF A FEVER WHICH HAS LEFT HIM BUT RETURNS AGAIN
ON THE CONTRARY IN THE DEBASEMENT OF A COMMON OR HUMBLE ATTACHMENT HE WOULD ENCOUNTER EVEN AMONG HIS MEANEST SUBJECTS CARPING AND SARCASTIC REMARKS
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE TRAMMELS OF M
SHE LANGUIDLY OPENED HER EYES AND WITH A DYING LOOK MURMURED OH
I DO NOT WISH THAT FELLOW TO SEE YOU WITH ME OR HE WILL TAKE AN AVERSION TO YOU ARAMIS PRESSED HIS HAND SAYING WHAT NEED HAVE I OF HIS FRIENDSHIP WHILE YOU ARE HERE YES BUT I MAY NOT ALWAYS BE HERE REPLIED FOUQUET DEJECTEDLY
THAT FUTURE WHICH TEN YEARS MORE OF MY OWN LIFE WOULD HAVE RENDERED ETERNAL
COME MONSEIGNEUR YOU DECIDE ME
D'ARTAGNAN FROM MY BIRTH DE WARDES WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN DE GUICHE INTERRUPTED HIM
MADAME HATED PEOPLE WHO TALKED MUCH AND TOOK A REMARKABLY CRUEL REVENGE UPON THEM FOR SHE ALLOWED THEM TO TALK
I WAS ABOUT TO SEND TO INFORM YOU THAT I COULD NOT ATTEND TO-DAY INDEED SAID THE KING IN APPARENT SURPRISE
I WISH SOME GENTLEMAN WHO IS SO DISPOSED TO ESCORT THE COMTE DE LA FERE CRIED D'ARTAGNAN
YOU ARE A PERFECT MONSTER OF WICKEDNESS I WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH FONTAINEBLEAU
THERE THAT WILL DO
WHAT DO YOU THINK ASKED DE GUICHE OF THIS HORSE WHICH I HAVE JUST PURCHASED TO LOOK AT IT IT SEEMS PERFECT MONSIEUR LE COMTE
DO YOU NOT KNOW HIS NAME WELL I THINK YOU KNOW HIM THEN I HAVE KNOWN HIM NEARLY FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS SIRE WHY HE IS SCARCELY TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD CRIED THE KING
WHILE ON THE CONTRARY THE ANGER OF THE KING MAY NOW DRAW DOWN A STORM UPON HIS HEAD THE END OF WHICH NO ONE CAN FORESEE THE CHEVALIER SMILED AND MUTTERED TO HIMSELF THAT IS THE VERY THING I WISH AND AT THE SAME TIME HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS A MOVEMENT WHICH DID NOT ESCAPE THE COUNT WHO DREADED IF HE QUITTED THE COURT TO SEEM TO YIELD TO A FEELING OF FEAR
YOU PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN
YOU ARE VERY WELL WHERE YOU ARE
THERE ARE TWENTY PISTOLES HERE SAID MALICORNE
ON THE CONTRARY SHE IS BETTER
RAOUL FELT HIS WHOLE FRAME TREMBLE AT THE CONTACT OF HER HAND
DE MONTESPAN IS ATTENTIVE TO ME BUT THAT DOES NOT COMMIT ME IN ANY WAY
AS FOR LOUIS XIV HIS HAPPINESS WAS SO EXTREME THAT HE HAD FORGIVEN MADAME OR NEARLY SO HER LITTLE PIECE OF MALICE OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING
BUT SUBMIT GENTLEMEN THAT A THRUST OF THE SWORD THROUGH THE BODY AS WAS THE CUSTOM FORMERLY WAS FAR BETTER THAN TYRANNY LIKE THIS NO MONSIEUR REPLIED BUCKINGHAM
DE GUICHE IS THAT YOU
LASTLY AT A GALLOP
WELL REPEATED SAINT-AIGNAN
I HATED HER FOR NOT BEING AS UNHAPPY AS MYSELF
DE WARDES WAS STILL ONLY AT BUCKINGHAM'S AFFAIR
BUT THERE WERE OTHERS--KEEN-SIGHTED OBSERVERS ARE ALWAYS TO BE MET WITH AT COURT--WHO REMARKED HIS PALENESS AND HIS ALTERED LOOKS
R
THE HONOR ON THE CONTRARY IS MINE AND I FEEL OVERPOWERED BY IT I AM AWARE REPLIED FOUQUET THAT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE MASTER MAY APPEAR MORE BRILLIANT AND DESIRABLE THAN THAT OF THE SERVANT
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS WOULD BE MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME
AND WE WILL TRY TO REPAIR THE OMISSION
BEHIND THEM HE COULD PERCEIVE THE SHADOW OF DE GUICHE HIS EYES GLITTERING IN THE OBSCURITY FASTENED ARDENTLY UPON THE PRINCESS'S SITTING APARTMENT WHICH WAS PARTIALLY LIGHTED BY THE LAMP IN THE INNER ROOM
HE SEEMED TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM AS HE WENT ALONG A TRACE OF A MYSTERIOUS SORROW
IN THIS MANNER EVERYTHING EXPLAINS ITSELF
YOU ARE QUITE SURE OF YOUR FIGURES M
HERS WAS ONE OF THOSE FINELY-ORGANIZED NATURES CAPABLE OF LOOKING INWARDLY AT ITSELF AS WELL AS AT OTHERS AT THE SAME MOMENT
ADIEU ADIEU MONSIEUR LE COMTE
YOU DON'T EASILY GET ALARMED I WILL TELL YOU WHAT MAKES ME ANXIOUS
JEALOUS OF HIS AUTHORITY HE SAID WITH AN ASSUMED FRANKNESS
OF COURSE REPLIED SAINT-AIGNAN WHO ON HIS SIDE HOPING THAT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE TOO WOULD FAINT ADVANCING TOWARDS HER HOLDING HIS ARMS EXTENDED,--"OF COURSE
IF HE HAS THOSE WHICH THE KING REQUIRES TO-DAY SAID MARGUERITE HE WILL NOT PERHAPS POSSESS THOSE WHICH THE KING WILL DEMAND IN A MONTH OR SO THE KING WILL EXACT MONEY FROM HIM AGAIN THEN NO DOUBT
A WORD WILL NOT BE ENOUGH
ALL THESE TRAVELERS HAD ARRIVED ON THE SAME DAY AND YET THEIR ARRIVAL HAD OCCASIONED NO CONFUSION IN THE INN NO STOPPAGE IN THE STREET
WHILST ON THE CONTRARY IN REALITY SHE DID
TO-DAY HOWEVER IS THE THIRTY-FIRST OF MAY AND HE HAS NOT BEEN YET AND TO-MORROW AT MIDDAY THE PAYMENT FALLS DUE
AS THE DAUGHTER OF A PRESIDENT OF ACCOUNTS SHE HAD BROUGHT A MARRIAGE PORTION OF THIRTY THOUSAND CROWNS TO HER HUSBAND WHO WAS SYNDIC OF THE GOLDSMITHS
TELL ME RATHER WHAT YOU YOURSELF THINK OF THE STEP I HAVE TAKEN YOU BRING ME THIS MONEY FOR MYSELF AND YOU BRING IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW ME TO BE EMBARRASSED
MY AUNT'S MAJOR-DOMO
BUT I KNOW TOO WELL THAT THE COMTE DE LA FERE IS TOO UPRIGHT AND HONORABLE A MAN TO ALLOW ME TO FEAR FOR A SINGLE MOMENT THAT THERE IS AS YOU INSINUATE ANY STAIN UPON MY BIRTH
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ANSWER ME PERSISTED RAOUL TRANQUILLY
THEY COULD BE SOLD THEN ALL YOUR JEWELS COULD BE SOLD MADAME
HE WAS PERHAPS ALREADY BEGINNING TO ASSUME THE AIRS OF A CONQUEROR BUT NOW HE RETREATS DEFEATED
I WAS OFFERING TO LAY YOU TWENTY PISTOLES AGAINST THESE YOU HAVE LENT ME THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE COMTE DE GUICHE'S LETTER IN HOW SOON IN EIGHT HOURS HAVE YOU A WINGED HORSE THEN THAT IS NO MATTER
WHERE ARE THOSE FIFTY PISTOLES HERE SAID MALICORNE SLAPPING HIS POCKET
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU TO SAY FAREWELL REPLIED RAOUL WARMLY PRESSING THE COMTE'S HAND
WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED AT ALL IF IT HAD BEEN INTENDED TO RELEASE ME AFTERWARDS HOW OLD ARE YOU I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS YOUR NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAME BY WHICH I WAS CALLED WHO ARE YOUR PARENTS I NEVER KNEW THEM BUT THOSE WHO BROUGHT YOU UP THEY DID NOT CALL ME THEIR SON DID YOU EVER LOVE ANY ONE BEFORE COMING HERE I LOVED MY NURSE AND MY FLOWERS WAS THAT ALL I ALSO LOVED MY VALET DO YOU REGRET YOUR NURSE AND YOUR VALET I WEPT VERY MUCH WHEN THEY DIED DID THEY DIE SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE OR BEFORE YOU CAME THEY DIED THE EVENING BEFORE I WAS CARRIED OFF BOTH AT THE SAME TIME YES BOTH AT THE SAME TIME IN WHAT MANNER WERE YOU CARRIED OFF A MAN CAME FOR ME DIRECTED ME TO GET INTO A CARRIAGE WHICH WAS CLOSED AND LOCKED AND BROUGHT ME HERE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT MAN AGAIN HE WAS MASKED IS THIS NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY TALE SAID BAISEMEAUX IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE TO ARAMIS WHO COULD HARDLY
THE KING AGAIN MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND WITHOUT SHOWING A PREFERENCE FOR ANY PARTICULAR CARRIAGE DOOR HE RETURNED TO FONTAINEBLEAU THE REINS HANGING OVER HIS HORSE'S NECK ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
WHAT CAN THAT MATTER TO HIM
IT WAS BASED HE CLAIMED ON SOME MANUSCRIPTS HE HAD FOUND A YEAR EARLIER IN THE BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE WHILE RESEARCHING A HISTORY HE PLANNED TO WRITE ON LOUIS XIV
TAKE M
COLBERT ON THE SUBJECT MARGUERITE ROSE SMILINGLY AS THOUGH TO TAKE LEAVE BUT THE MARQUISE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO IMITATE HER
DE GUICHE OBSERVING THAT SHE WAS ALONE NEAR A THICKET CONSTRUCTED OF PAINTED CLOTH APPROACHED HER
HE WAS CALLED THE COUNCILOR.--AND FINALLY A FLEMISH LADY WITH A MAN-SERVANT A LADY'S MAID AND A FEMALE COMPANION A LARGE RETINUE OF SERVANTS GREAT DISPLAY AND IMMENSE HORSES
TYRCIS SAID THE COMTE HAD A FAITHFUL COMPANION OR RATHER A DEVOTED SERVANT WHOSE NAME WAS--AMYNTAS AH SAID MADAME ARCHLY NOW FOR THE PORTRAIT OF AMYNTAS
I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF SEEING HIS MAJESTY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU REQUIRE NO RECOMMENDATION TO HIM
DO YOU ON YOUR SIDE GET TWO OR THREE YOU ARE A WONDERFUL MAN MY DEAR D'HERBLAY ARAMIS SMILED
FAREWELL MANICAMP AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
HARDLY HAD THE VIBRATION OF HER VOICE REACHED HIS EAR THAN HE ROSE RADIANT WITH DELIGHT AND PASSING ACROSS THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD TO LA VALLIERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN MADEMOISELLE HE SAID YOU ARE A WOMAN AND EVERY WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR JEWELS WHICH ARE A WOMAN'S APPURTENANCE OH SIRE SAID LA VALLIERE YOUR MAJESTY WILL NOT ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN MY MODESTY I BELIEVE YOU POSSESS EVERY VIRTUE MADEMOISELLE
IN ADDITION TO THESE THE ILLUMINATIONS ON THE BORDERS OF THE SHEET OF WATER COST THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS EVERY EVENING
YOU SEE I AM DETERMINED TO PUSH YOU HARD THE PROFOUND WISH I HAD THAT YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD ACCEPT MY INVITATION WELL MONSIEUR FOUQUET NOTHING IS EASIER I PERCEIVE THAN OUR COMING TO AN UNDERSTANDING
MALICORNE IT IS NOW TIME TO LEAVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER
IT IS ONLY THIS VERY DAY THAT I RECOLLECTED I OUGHT TO HAVE SET OFF FOUR DAYS AGO INDEED SAID MONSIEUR
THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD NO POWER TO MOVE
THESE ARE NO JESTS FOR NOTHING IS MORE SERIOUS
HOWEVER WHILE THESE GLOOMY FOREBODINGS CAST A SHADE OF ANXIETY OVER DE GUICHE'S COUNTENANCE DE WARDES HAD RESUMED THE ENTIRE MASTERY OVER HIMSELF
BUT YOU KNOW THAT WHEREVER THE KING GOES THE KING IS IN HIS OWN PALACE
LET US INVENT THEN THIS STORY OF MY LOVING HIM AND PREFERRING HIM TO OTHERS
I DO NOT SUPPOSE IT IS A STATE SECRET BUT A SECRET--LIKE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AT THE BASTILE BUT SAID ARAMIS WHY DO YOU SPEAK MORE FREELY OF SELDON THAN OF SECOND BERTAUDIERE BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THE CRIME OF THE MAN WHO WRITES A DISTICH IS NOT SO GREAT AS THAT OF THE MAN WHO RESEMBLES YES YES
ATHENAIS YOU WILL MAKE YOUR WAY IN THE WORLD DO YOU NOT APPROVE OF WHAT I SAY COMPLETELY REPLIED HER LAUGHING COMPANION
THE CARRIAGES WHICH HAD REMAINED SHELTERED UNDER THE TREES ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TENT FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF SERVANTS BEARERS AND FEMALE ATTENDANTS WHO WHILE THEIR MASTERS HAD BEEN BATHING HAD MUTUALLY EXCHANGED THEIR OWN OBSERVATIONS CRITICAL REMARKS AND THE DISCUSSION OF MATTERS PERSONAL--THE FUGITIVE JOURNAL OF THAT PERIOD OF WHICH NO ONE NOW REMEMBERS ANYTHING NOT EVEN BY THE WAVES THE WITNESSES OF WHAT WENT ON THAT DAY--THEMSELVES NOW SUBLIMED INTO IMMENSITY AS THE ACTORS HAVE VANISHED INTO ETERNITY
FOR IN VERY TRUTH LOVE IS SO SWEET A FANCY THAT TO LOSE IT FANCY THOUGH IT MAY BE IS TO LOSE MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF
DID YOU NOT TELL ME SIRE THAT SHE HAD FAINTED SHE IS STILL VERY ILL SAID THE KING AFFECTING THE GREATEST INDIFFERENCE
SOME ONE IS COMING THE KING LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM AND SAID NO THERE IS NO ONE AND THEN CONTINUED
AS MONSIEUR WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE AND A FEW OTHER INTIMATE COMPANIONS WAS MOUNTING HIS HORSE TO SET OFF FOR THE RIVER TO TAKE ONE OF THOSE CELEBRATED BATHS WITH WHICH THE LADIES OF THE COURT WERE SO INFATUATED AS IN FACT NO ONE REMAINED IN THE CHATEAU WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MADAME WHO UNDER THE PRETEXT OF INDISPOSITION WOULD NOT LEAVE HER ROOM
D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL OF COURSE LEAVE ME TO DEAL WITH THE MATTER SAID DE WARDES
I AM READY TO LISTEN TO YOU AND TO JUDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SECRET A SECRET OF THE VALUE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE THE HONOR TO CONFIDE TO YOU CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED BY WORD OF MOUTH
BUT I FIND MONTALAIS THERE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN STILL LAUGHING
BY THIS SIGN YOU SHALL CONQUER FOOTNOTE 10
AND IT IS NOT PROPER TO LEAVE HER IN A POSITION WHERE HER REPUTATION HER VIRTUE EVEN MAY BE ASSAILED
BY THIS TIME IT WAS HIGH TIDE
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT MISERABLE LETTER WHICH HAS NO MEANING AT ALL IN IT I SHOULD HAVE DETECTED IN THE GROVE YONDER A CHARMING LITTLE INTRIGUE WHICH WOULD HAVE COMPROMISED A WOMAN WOULD HAVE PERHAPS HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS A SWORD-THRUST FOR A MAN AND HAVE DIVERTED MONSIEUR FOR MANY DAYS TO COME HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
BUT AS SPOKEN BY FOUQUET WHOM THE KING HAD ADDRESSED AS THE SUPERINTENDENT IT SEEMED TO ACQUIRE AN INSIGNIFICANT AND PETTY CHARACTER THAT AT THIS JUNCTURE SERVED ADMIRABLY TO RESTORE FOUQUET TO HIS PLACE AND COLBERT TO HIS OWN
JOY AND HEALTH SPARKLED IN HER BEAUTIFUL EYES
THEY REQUIRE GOLD AND INCOMES TO SUPPLY MEANS OF AMUSEMENT
ONE MOMENT SAID THE PRINCE
ARE YOU NOT LODGING AT THE SIGN OF THE BEAU PAON MONTALAIS MONTALAIS YOU NOW BETRAY THAT YOU WERE AWARE OF MY BEING AT FONTAINEBLEAU WELL
SUCH IS MY NATURE
MONSIEUR SAID HE AT THE EXPIRATION OF A MINUTE NOT ONLY IS BELLE-ISLE KNOWN TO ME BUT STILL FURTHER BELLE-ISLE IS MINE THAT IS WELL
I APPROVE M
I WAS STILL HALF CRAZY AT YOU KNOW WHAT
IN MOST OTHER EDITIONS THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER AND THE NEXT ARE USUALLY COMBINED INTO ONE CHAPTER ENTITLED D'ARTAGNAN CALLS DE WARDES TO ACCOUNT FOOTNOTE 3
AND THEN APPROACHING LA VALLIERE HE SAID YOU ARE NOT WELL MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
AND CONFIDENT THAT EXISTENCE WOULD BE PROLONGED A FEW DAYS FURTHER I SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS
TO-DAY MY MAJOR HAS LEAVE OF ABSENCE
I SPOKE OF PREFERENCE AND OF VISITS DID I NOT
WITHOUT BEING VERY BLAMABLE A WOMAN CAN EXCITE A GOOD DEAL OF UNEASINESS
THE DUKE'S SECRETARY DREW OUT A PURSE FILLED WITH GOLD FROM HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE ONE AMONG THOSE PRESENT WHO APPEARED OF MOST IMPORTANCE SAYING
I HAVE THE FIRMEST PRINCIPLES
TELL ME WHAT PRIESTS ARE THERE HERE WHAT PRIESTS YES
AND THEN HE MURMURED A FEW WORDS SO FULL OF TENDERNESS BUT PRONOUNCED IN SO LOW A TONE THAT THE HISTORIAN WHO OUGHT TO HEAR EVERYTHING COULD NOT HEAR THEM
TEN MINUTES HAD HARDLY ELAPSED WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S CARRIAGE WAS OBSERVED TO MOVE
NAY NAY ONE MOMENT MY DEAR COMTE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
MADAME HAD HAD BREAKFAST SERVED IN HER OWN APARTMENT AND MONSIEUR HAD BREAKFASTED ALMOST ALONE
NOW YOU ARE WANTING IN FEELING FOUQUET PRESSED HIS CLENCHED HAND UPON HIS BREAST HEAVING WITH EMOTION SAYING
YES MONSIEUR REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
COUNT HE SAID YOU'RE A MAN OF EXCELLENT TASTE THANK YOU FOR THE COMPLIMENT REPLIED DE GUICHE
I AM YOUR MOTHER AND SHE IS NO MORE THAN A STRANGER TO ME
FORGIVE MY IMPORTUNITY SIRE
BUT HIS STORMY DEPARTURE HIS DISORDERED COUNTENANCE ALL KNEW OR AT LEAST THOUGHT THEY COULD TELL THE REASON OF
HAD HE WISHED TO DO SO WE SHOULD HARDLY VENTURE NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE ACCORDED AS HIS DUE TO SAY HE WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES ARE OWING TO A BREMEN MERCHANT OF THE NAME OF BONSTETT WHO CAME HERE TO GET THE GUARANTEE OF MY SIGNATURE HE SHALL BE PAID SAID ARAMIS
WHY DID HE NOW FIND THE SAME WOMAN SO BEAUTIFUL SO CAPTIVATING
TO HER THEN ALL MY DEVOTION ALL MY ATTENTION ALL THE TIME THAT I CAN SPARE FROM MY OCCUPATIONS SHALL BE DEVOTED
ADMIRABLY PLAYED A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR CURIOSITY SAID THE KING IN A HOARSE VOICE
NOTHING CAN EQUAL HER EXCELLENT VISION
HIS MAJESTY WAS DRESSED MAGNIFICENTLY AND IN THE MOST PERFECT TASTE
AS FAR AS BEAUTY IS CONCERNED I MUCH PREFER THAT WHICH THESE DARK WOODS PRESENT IN WHOSE DEPTHS CAN BE SEEN NOW IN ONE DIRECTION AND AGAIN IN ANOTHER A LIGHT PASSING BY AS THOUGH IT WERE AN EYE IN COLOR LIKE A MIDNIGHT RAINBOW SOMETIMES OPEN AT OTHERS CLOSED LA VALLIERE IS QUITE A POETESS SAID TONNAY-CHARENTE
NO HE SAID HASTILY
BUT ALL THE OTHER FEELINGS ARE AT THE SAME TIME DEVELOPED IN PROPORTION TO THEIR YOUTH AND VIGOR
OTHERS LESS BRILLIANT BUT MORE SENSIBLE HAD REMINDED HIM OF THE KING'S ORDERS PROHIBITING DUELING
AND THAT I AND THOSE WHO ARE WITH ME SHALL REMAIN IN THEM AT LEAST UNTIL AN AUTHORITY MORE POWERFUL AND MORE SUPREME THAN YOUR OWN SHALL DISMISS ME FROM THEM IN OTHER WORDS UNTIL WE ARE EJECTED AS THE LAWYERS SAY OBSERVED MANICAMP BLANDLY
ARE YOU NOT A SOVEREIGN POWER BUT ARE YOU SIRE A RELIABLE ALLY YOU SHALL SEE MADAME AND WHEN SHALL THIS ALLIANCE COMMENCE THIS VERY DAY I WILL DRAW UP THE TREATY AND YOU SHALL SIGN IT BLINDLY THEN SIRE I PROMISE YOU WONDERS
BESIDES SINCE THE BASTILE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WHY HAVE YOU NOT TRIED TO SCREW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT OF IT BECAUSE I AM AN HONEST MAN M
THIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER HOUSE UPON WHEELS EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE QUARTER IN WHICH HE RESIDED--IT WAS COVERED WITH ALLEGORICAL PAINTINGS AND CLOUDS SCATTERED OVER WITH STARS
SHELTERED BEHIND THE THICK CURTAINS OF HIS OWN TENT EMBRACING WITH A GLANCE THE WHOLE SQUARE HE NOTICED THAT AFTER A FEW MOMENTS PAUSE THE CURTAINS OF DE GUICHE'S TENT WERE AGITATED AND THEN DRAWN PARTIALLY ASIDE
FOR SHE WILL HAVE A SAD FELLOW FOR A HUSBAND NO MONSIEUR LE COMTE
OR STAY!--GO AND FETCH MONTALAIS AND THEN RETURN AND WAIT FOR ME WITH HER AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE FOREST AND THEN AS ATHENAIS HESITATED SHE AGAIN SAID GO IN A VOICE WHICH DID NOT ADMIT OF REPLY
WHAT EXCLAIMED MADAME AS IF SHE WERE GREATLY SURPRISED IS M
D'HERBLAY IT IS ONLY FOR MEN ATTACHED TO THE COURT AS YOU ARE TO TAKE TROUBLE ABOUT SUCH MATTERS YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT MY DEAR M
A MAN'S FIGURE MIGHT INDISTINCTLY BE PERCEIVED AND PUTTING THE BRANCHES OF THE BUSHES ASIDE HE APPEARED UPON THE VERGE OF THE WOOD AND PERCEIVING THAT THE PLACE WAS EMPTY BURST OUT INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHTER
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWENTY PISTOLES MON DIEU WELL SAID MALICORNE A LITTLE ANGRY SUPPOSE I WERE TO ADD THEM TO THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU ALREADY OWE ME YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED MANICAMP STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND AGAIN AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I CAN ACCEPT THEM
SUCH A STYLE OF DRESS IS NOT TO BE MET WITH AT TOURS OR ORLEANS NO MONSIEUR LE COMTE
RAOUL AND THE COMTE DE LA FERE REACHED PARIS THE EVENING OF THE SAME DAY ON WHICH BUCKINGHAM HAD HELD THE CONVERSATION WITH THE QUEEN-MOTHER
IT IS NOT HERE AS IT WAS AT BLOIS WHERE WE TOLD THE DOWAGER MADAME ALL OUR LITTLE ANNOYANCES AND ALL OUR LONGINGS
MY LORD DO NOT BELIEVE I AM SO STINGY AS THAT
THE DAY OF THE NUPTIAL BLESSING WHAT DOES THIS MEAN INQUIRED RAOUL OF MALICORNE
THESE GENTLEMEN WELL KNOW THAT EVERY SECRET FOR WHICH MEN FIGHT CEASES TO BE A SECRET
FOUQUET'S HOUSE IT IS USELESS DOING THAT
IF YOU DO NOT KILL YOURSELF YOU COMMIT A RIDICULOUS ACTION
LOUIS LOOKED AT HIM ASTONISHED
I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHY
THE KING NOTICING THIS TOOK LA VALLIERE'S HAND AND LED HER TO A LATERAL FOREST-ALLEY
THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO REMARK M
THEN TURNING TO THE JAILER HE ADDED
TAKE CARE COUNT SAID RAOUL APPROACHING HIS FRIEND AND PREPARING TO SUPPORT HIM AT THE MOMENT THE ARCHBISHOP BLESSED THE MARRIED COUPLE
YOU HAVE GUESSED RIGHTLY WELL THEN NOTHING CAN BE MORE MORAL OR PROPER I THINK SO MADAME AND I HAVE BEEN WRONG AS IT APPEARS IN REPROACHING YOU MADEMOISELLE VERY WRONG MADAME
BUT HAVE RESTED SATISFIED BY EXPRESSING MY HATRED IN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE ON WHOM A DUTY WAS ALMOST IMPOSED TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH IT
THE KING ON HIS SIDE WHO HAD CONCEIVED A STRONG PREDILECTION FOR HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S SOCIETY INVENTED A VARIETY OF AMUSEMENTS IN QUICK SUCCESSION TO EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO RENDER HER RESIDENCE IN PARIS AS CHEERFUL AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IN FACT NOT A DAY PASSED WITHOUT A BALL AT THE PALAIS ROYAL OR A RECEPTION IN MONSIEUR'S APARTMENTS
YES IT IS THE KING
DO NOT BE SHOCKED
SHE WAS CHARMING WHEN SHE LAUGHED BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE BECAME SERIOUS
THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN MADAME AGAIN TURNED ROUND AND LOOKING DE GUICHE FULL IN THE FACE WITH A BRIGHT AND STEADY GAZE SAID,--"WHY SO OH
I IMPLORE YOU TO CALM YOURSELF SHE WEPT HOWEVER AND LARGE TEARS FELL UPON HER HANDS
THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AMAZES ME IS THAT I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED IT ONLY TO-DAY AND THAT BY THE MEREST ACCIDENT THAT IS TRUE REPLIED MONTALAIS WITH HER USUAL GIDDINESS
BUCKINGHAM THE FATHER FOR THE QUEEN BUCKINGHAM THE SON FOR THE PRINCESS MANICAMP
IF IT WILL GIVE YOU ANY PLEASURE MONSIEUR AND WITH A MOVEMENT OF HER EYES AND SHOULDERS WHICH IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE MADAME EXTENDED TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN HER BEAUTIFUL AND PERFUMED HAND UPON WHICH HE PRESSED HIS LIPS
YOUR GRACE WILL REMEMBER SAID THE QUEEN THAT M
AND MY REASON FOR SOLICITING IT AT SUCH AN HOUR AND IN SUCH A LOCALITY WAS THAT THE HOUR SEEMED TO ME TO BE THE MOST PRUDENT AND THE LOCALITY THE LEAST OPEN TO OBSERVATION
BUT THIS WAS THE WAY THIS SYSTEM OF ABNEGATION WAS PAID FOR
IT IS AS I THOUGHT AND HE DIRECTED A LOOK OF INTELLIGENCE AT THE COMTE
ARAMIS SHUT AND BOLTED THE DOOR AND RETURNED TO THE SIDE OF THE FRANCISCAN
THERE IS NOTHING OF THE KIND IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL
BUCKINGHAM SAW THAT DE WARDES WAS ON THE POINT OF BEING AGAIN COVERED BY A WAVE
YET MADAME DID NOT FEAR LA VALLIERE IN THAT DIRECTION IN WHICH AN HISTORIAN WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING SEES INTO THE FUTURE OR RATHER THE PAST
AND THAT ONE I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH BUT M
THIS MARRIAGE IS OBJECTIONABLE TO ME BUT I IMPLORE YOUR MAJESTY TO CONSENT TO IT FORTHWITH AND THUS MAKE RAOUL HAPPY TELL ME COMTE IS SHE IN LOVE WITH HIM IF YOUR MAJESTY REQUIRES ME TO SPEAK CANDIDLY I DO NOT BELIEVE IN MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S AFFECTION
YES YES YOU HAVE IT
AS FAR AS CONCERNED THE DAY WHEN THE BOMBSHELL OF THE PAST SHOULD BURST IF EVER THERE WERE ANY OCCASION SAINT-AIGNAN PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD BY THAT TIME HAVE TAKEN ALL POSSIBLE PRECAUTIONS AND WOULD PRETEND AN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF THE MATTER TO THE KING
MAKE YOURSELF QUITE COMFORTABLE
THIS IS INDEED ZEAL EXCLAIMED THE KING DELIGHTED TO SEE HIMSELF SO PROMPTLY OBEYED
THAT WAS BUT JUST YOU WILL SAY SINCE M
YOU PERMITTED US TO BE DECEIVED BY THIS SHAMELESS TRICK SIRE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WHOSE AGITATION WAS SUCH AS TO MAKE HIM TREMBLE IN EVERY LIMB LET ME ENTREAT YOUR MAJESTY NOT TO EXASPERATE YOURSELF
I DID NOT SEE HIM NOR DO I KNOW HIM WHAT
I FORGET PRECISELY WHICH LA VALLIERE LISTENED HER EYES FIXED HER BOSOM HEAVING AS IF GIFTED WITH AN ACUTENESS OF PERCEPTION SHE FORESAW A PORTION OF THE TRUTH
THE OLD LADY WOULD NEITHER LISTEN TO NOR SEE ANYTHING
IN WHAT WAY MAY I ASK YOU YOU ARE WRONG MONSIEUR BECAUSE YOU ARE ALWAYS SPEAKING ILL OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING REPLIED RAOUL WITH UNDISTURBED COMPOSURE
D'HERBLAY AND YET SHOULD NOT HAVE SHOWN HIM BELLE-ISLE OH SIRE REPLIED THE BISHOP WITHOUT GIVING FOUQUET TIME TO ANSWER WE POOR BRETON PRELATES SELDOM LEAVE OUR RESIDENCES M
ARAMIS SLOWLY FOLDED THE LETTER AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
UNDERSTAND ME
I THINK SHE HAS RATHER TOO MUCH FLAX-YELLOW AND LILY-WHITENESS IN HER COMPLEXION REPLIED MADAME FIXING IN A MOMENT UPON THE ONLY FAULT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE ALMOST PERFECT BEAUTY OF THE FUTURE MADAME DE MONTESPAN RATHER TOO FAIR YES
I AM AT YOUR ORDERS MONSIEUR SAID DE WARDES
THE FACT IS I THINK I RECOLLECT HEARING THAT EACH TOWER HAS A NAME OF ITS OWN
AT FIRST HE MADE THE HORSE WALK THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OF THE COURT-YARD AT A FOOT-PACE
IT ENTERS INTO YOUR POLICY AND FORMS PART OF OUR PLANS THAT YOU SHOULD ASSIDUOUSLY DEVOTE YOURSELF TO HIS MAJESTY'S FRIENDS
I REMEMBER HAVING HEARD YOU OCCASIONALLY CALL ME THE GREAT ATHOS
HIS LEGS THE BEST-SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH-COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
FOUQUET HAS NOT WOUNDED YOU SAID MARGUERITE VANEL WITH THE MOST PERFECT SIMPLICITY
A PRETEXT HOWEVER POOR IT MAY BE IS ALL I REQUIRE
BUT BE ASSURED THAT THE EXILE WHICH DE GUICHE WILL VOLUNTARILY IMPOSE UPON HIMSELF WILL BE OF SHORT DURATION
AND AS MONSIEUR FOUQUET POSSESSED IF NOT THE FRIENDSHIP AT LEAST THE RESPECT OF EVERY ONE
HENRIETTA NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU
DO NOT TAKE ANY OF MY WORDS THEN TO YOURSELF EXCEPT SUCH AS YOU THINK YOU DESERVE
THE INTEREST TAKEN IN THIS HAZARDOUS EXPEDITION WAS UNIVERSAL
DE BEAUTRU IN ORDER TO GET BETTER ADVICE SAID MANICAMP WITH A COMICAL SERIOUSNESS OF EXPRESSION YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO ADOPT A MORE PRECISE FORMULA THAN YOU HAVE USED TOWARDS ME IF RAOUL WERE HERE SAID DE GUICHE HE WOULD BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND ME SO I THINK PARTICULARLY IF YOU SAID TO HIM
YOU WHO FROM PROCUREUR-GENERAL ATTAINED THE RANK OF INTENDANT FROM THE RANK OF INTENDANT THAT OF THE FIRST MINISTER OF THE CROWN AND WHO FROM THE RANK OF FIRST MINISTER WILL PASS TO THAT OF MAYOR OF THE PALACE
HE DESCRIBED THE PONTIFF'S AUXILIARIES HIS MEANS OF ACTION AND INDICATED THE PARTICULAR LOCALITY IN THE ARCHIPELAGO WHERE BY A SUDDEN SURPRISE TWO CARDINALS ADEPTS OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR AND CONSEQUENTLY HIGH IN AUTHORITY WERE TO BE TRANSPORTED TOGETHER WITH THIRTY-TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL AFFILIATED MEMBERS OF ROME
THE ORDER TO WHICH I BELONG AND FOR WHICH I AM TRAVELING DOES NOT REQUIRE ME TO BEG
THE KING IS SO SIMPLE AND SO CONCEITED THAT HE WILL BELIEVE ME
AGAIN YOU EVADE ME OR RATHER YOU WISH TO ESCAPE ME
SO I WILL SAY NO MORE TO YOU WELL NO I DON'T OVERWHELM YOU
BUT AFTER DINNER AS THERE WERE SOME AMETHYSTS TO BE LOOKED AT DE GUICHE RETURNED TO MADAME'S CABINET
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WAS THE LAST OF THE LADIES INSCRIBED FOR TICKETS
THE TWO FRIENDS
BUT HITHERTO WE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF LEAVING THEM IN PARIS
THE ROOM THEN HE SAID
MADAME HE SAID WILL BE BRILLIANT
IT IS THAT WHICH DOES HARM
OF ALL HIS AUXILIARIES ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO SECURE
BUT BEFORE SPEAKING OF HIM LET US SPEAK OF YOURSELF M
WOULD YOU NOT IF YOU SAW SOME ONE ALWAYS NEAR MADAME AND ALWAYS TREATED WITH GREAT FAVOR TAKE UMBRAGE AT IT
WHILE THE MARECHAL DE GRAMONT HAD ONLY ALLOWED HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS
THEY WILL AMUSE ME
SUPPOSING I WISHED TO SELL THEM I KNOW VERY WELL WHO WOULD BUY THEM EXCLAIMED M
IT IS NOT CURIOSITY BUT A DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ANYTHING I CAN NO MADAME
YOU ARE MAD M
FROM THE PERFECT PASSIVENESS OF HER ARMS AND BUST SHE MORE RESEMBLED ONE WHOSE SOUL HAD PASSED AWAY THAN A LIVING BEING
I SEE MANICAMP THERE
CHAPTER XXIV
BY HER MEANS MALICORNE LEARNT ALL THAT PASSED AT BLOIS IN THE FAMILY OF THE DOWAGER MADAME
FOR THE SWORD-THRUST WHEN RECEIVED WAS NO INDICATION THAT A PARTICULAR PERSON WAS RIGHT OR WRONG
BY DEGREES AS THE SIGHT BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO SO MUCH BRILLIANCY THE RAREST BEAUTIES APPEARED TO THE VIEW AS IN THE EVENING SKY THE STARS APPEAR ONE BY ONE TO HIM WHO CLOSES HIS EYES AND THEN OPENS THEM AGAIN
GUICHE RECOGNIZED HIM AS MUCH BY HIS DRESS AS BY HIS FEATURES FOR HE HAD VERY FREQUENTLY SEEN MANICAMP IN HIS VIOLET SUIT WHICH WAS HIS LAST RESOURCE
I WILL GO THERE AT ONCE AND AT ALL EVENTS I SHALL HAVE A MEANS OF INTRODUCTION IN THE SHAPE OF A MAGNIFICENT PAIR OF ANTIQUE CAMEOS SET WITH DIAMONDS I HAVE SEEN THEM AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE COSTLY AND REGAL AT THIS MOMENT THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A SERVANT FOLLOWED BY A COURIER
SIRE WHEN I SHALL HAVE SACRIFICED MY HONOR AND MY REASON BOTH TO YOU YOU WILL PERHAPS BELIEVE IN MY LOYALTY
HE IS INDEED A REMARKABLE FACE SAID THE KING FOLLOWING HIM WITH HIS EYES AS LONG AS HE COULD SEE HIM AND EVEN TO A CERTAIN DEGREE WHEN HE WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN
AT THE NAME--AT THE FOOTSTEPS OF MARGUERITE VANEL MADAME DE BELLIERE RAN TO MEET HER
THIS MESSENGER WAS EASILY RECOGNIZED
OF ALL HIS ENEMIES ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD PROVE MOST DANGEROUS
HAVE YOU NOT PERSECUTED ME ENOUGH TYRANT THAT YOU ARE I A TYRANT SAID MALICORNE
I THOUGHT I HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT THAT MARCHIALI NO IT IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD HIS NAME PRONOUNCED THAT MAY BE BUT PERHAPS I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT HIM WITHOUT NAMING HIM IS HE AN OLD OFFENDER ASKED ARAMIS ATTEMPTING TO SMILE
ONLY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT SAID LOUISE
BUT IF YOU SUPPOSE THE EXPRESSION OF MY OWN WISH ON THE SUBJECT MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY INFLUENCE WITH THE KING I WILL GLADLY VOLUNTEER TO ENTREAT HIS MAJESTY CHARLES II
CHILD THAT YOU ARE DO NOT DREAM OF IT
THE PENSION IS A HEAVY ONE AND THE ORDER IS NOT WEALTHY
IF YOU WITHDRAW ON THAT ACCOUNT YOU MUST INDEED BE VERY JEALOUS ONE CANNOT HELP BEING JEALOUS MONSEIGNEUR WHEN ONE LOVES
RETURN HOME AND BRING THE SUM IN QUESTION IN NOTES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE YES MADAME BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE NOT A WORD M
WHAT PERFECT FINISH QUEEN MARIA THERESA EASILY SAW AND THAT TOO AT THE VERY FIRST GLANCE THAT THE KING WOULD NOT OFFER THE BRACELETS TO HER
HE WAS LIKE THE SMALLER VESSELS THAT ALWAYS FOLLOW IN THE WAKE OF AND AS TENDERS TO THE LARGER SHIPS
MY HEART IS FULL OF BITTERNESS AND I AM IN UTTER DESPAIR
SHE FELT HER LIMBS FAIL AND HER STRENGTH ABANDONING HER AND GLIDING ALMOST INANIMATE FROM THE ARMS OF HER COMPANIONS SANK DOWN UPON THE TURF
HE CAME VERY AFFECTIONATELY TO INQUIRE AFTER THE EVEN NOW UNCERTAIN HEALTH OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER AND TO ANNOUNCE TO HER THAT THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO FONTAINEBLEAU WERE COMPLETE
LET US TAKE THE EVIL IN TIME ON THE CONTRARY
THE CANNON FROM THE FORTS FIRED SALUTES WHICH WERE RETURNED BY THE FLAGSHIP AND THE TWO OTHER VESSELS AND THE FLASHES FROM THE OPEN MOUTHS OF THE CANNON FLOATED IN WHITE FUMES OVER THE WAVES AND DISAPPEARED IN THE CLEAR BLUE SKY
OH SIRE SIRE SHE EXCLAIMED IN ACCENTS OF EAGER APPREHENSIONS WHICH GREATLY AGITATED THE KING
PAY YOUR COURT THEREFORE TO LA VALLIERE I WILL PAY MY COURT TO WHOMSOEVER YOU LIKE REPLIED FOUQUET HIS HEART FILLED WITH HAPPINESS
BUT I PERCEIVE I HAVE FOUND ONLY A MASTER AND I REBEL
COME MARGUERITE TELL ME IS IT TO TELL ME ALL THESE FOOLISH REPORTS THAT YOU HAVE COME TO SEE ME SO EARLY IN THE DAY NO
I PERCEIVE FROM YOUR FACE THAT THE VERY IDEA WHICH SADDENS YOU SO MUCH NOW WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED BEFORE SIX MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND WILL BE NOT ONLY DEAD BUT FORGOTTEN IN THE PERIOD OF ABSENCE I HAVE ASSIGNED YOU I THINK YOU JUDGED ME BETTER A LITTLE WHILE AGO MADAME REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WHEN YOU SAID THAT TIME IS POWERLESS AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY OF BUCKINGHAM SILENCE SAID THE QUEEN KISSING THE DUKE UPON THE FOREHEAD WITH AN AFFECTION SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN
BUT THE KING DID NOT REPLY
WE WILL SAY THAT WE BOTH DID OUR UTMOST TO KEEP HIM AND YOU AT LEAST WILL NOT BE SPEAKING OTHERWISE THAN THE TRUTH
FOR IT IS PLEASING TO THINK THAT SUCH A SENTIMENT OF DELICACY AND RECTITUDE AND WHICH DID NOT EXIST IT SEEMS IN OUR MINDS LIVES IN OUR CHILDREN
MORE PARTICULARLY SINCE I RECALL SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE THIS EVENING IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS THE KING SUDDENLY STOPPED LEAVING HIS MEANING UNEXPRESSED
I WAS BECOMING UNEASY ABOUT YOU
I BEGGED A FRIEND A PROTECTOR OF MINE WHO HAD OBTAINED THE APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SOLICIT ONE FOR LOUISE
AND WHOEVER PLEASES WELL SAID MONTALAIS YOU DO NOT FINISH IT IS TOO DIFFICULT REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE LAUGHING LOUDLY
IT WAS REMARKED THAT AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR HIS MAJESTY FREED FROM EVERY RESTRAINT OR NOT EQUAL TO THE SITUATION SIGHED VERY DEEPLY
WHEN THE KING MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS THE COURTIERS WHOM THE NEWS OF A CONJUGAL MISUNDERSTANDING HAD DISPERSED THROUGH THE VARIOUS APARTMENTS BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THE MOST SERIOUS APPREHENSIONS
HOW A POST IN MONSIEUR'S HOUSEHOLD AND THE POCKET IS FULL AGAIN YOU HAVE THE POST THAT IS I HAVE THE PROMISE OF BEING NOMINATED WELL YES
WHILE HIS ATTENDANTS WERE ENGAGED IN CURLING HIS HAIR HE SANG THE PRINCIPAL AIRS OF THE BALLET WHICH THE VIOLINS HAD PLAYED AND TO WHICH THE KING HAD DANCED
THE CARRIAGE ROLLED ALONG UNDER THE ARCHWAY BUT AT THE MOMENT THE IRON-GATE WAS OPENED THE OFFICER APPROACHED THE CARRIAGE WHICH HAD AGAIN BEEN STOPPED AND SAID SOMETHING TO THE GOVERNOR WHO IMMEDIATELY PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE DOOR-WAY AND PERCEIVED ARAMIS ON HORSEBACK AT THE END OF THE DRAWBRIDGE
ON THE CONTRARY MADAME YOUNG AMIABLE OF CULTIVATED INTELLECT COQUETTISH LOVING IN HER NATURE BUT RATHER FROM FANCY OR IMAGINATION OR AMBITION THAN FROM HER HEART--MADAME WE SAY ON THE CONTRARY INAUGURATED THAT EPOCH OF LIGHT AND FLEETING AMUSEMENTS WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE LAST QUARTER OF THE EIGHTEENTH
DE BRAGELONNE'S EXCUSES A WEAK PRETEXT SAID DE GUICHE
MY LORD SAID THE COMTE IT IS NOT I WHO AM DIRECTLY INTERESTED IN THE LADY OF WHOM I HAVE JUST SPOKEN
WHAT IS THE MATTER YOUNG LADIES SAID LOUIS
FEVER IS AN ARGUMENT THAT CANNOT BE ANSWERED AND RAOUL HAD AN ATTACK
WHEN YOU MAKE A PURCHASE IT IS OF THE VERY BEST
BUT BEING THERE AND HAVING SEEN THE BOUDOIR SO COQUETTISHLY DECORATED THAT IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID THE LEAST PARTICLE OF DUST HAD BUT THE MOMENT BEFORE BEEN REMOVED BY THE SERVANTS
MANICAMP DO YOU FOLLOW ME
A SILENCE OF ASTONISHMENT MORE PROFOUND THAN THAT OF DEATH REIGNED IN THE ASSEMBLY
HOLA SOME ONE THERE CALLED OUT D'ARTAGNAN LEANING OVER THE GILDED BALUSTRADE
GUICHE MADE HIM A VERY PROFOUND BOW
IN OTHER WORDS WITH THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF THE KINGDOM CERTAINLY SIRE REPLIED LA VALLIERE AND IT IS A VERY DISTINGUISHED HONOR FOR ME
YOU GO ALONG BY THE HEDGE UNTIL YOU REACH A PLACE WHERE THE PATHS CROSS YES YOU WILL SEE FOUR PATHS EXACTLY ONE OF WHICH YOU WILL TAKE WHICH OF THEM THAT TO THE RIGHT THAT TO THE RIGHT NO TO THE LEFT THE DEUCE NO NO WAIT A MINUTE YOU DO NOT SEEM TO BE QUITE SURE
YOU WILL NOT BREAK YOURSELF OF THE HABIT SAID RAOUL TO DE WARDES OF INSULTING THE ABSENT
YOU MAY BE CERTAIN I SHALL INFORM MADAME OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE APARTMENT OF ONE OF HER LADIES OF HONOR OH DEAR MOTHER CRIED MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FOR MERCY'S SAKE SPARE HOLD YOUR TONGUE MADEMOISELLE AND DO NOT USELESSLY TROUBLE YOURSELF TO INTERCEDE FOR UNWORTHY PEOPLE
THIS MERCHANT'S NAME WAS MEINHEER BONSTETT.--A VENETIAN SENATOR WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER BOTH EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL
MONSIEUR AT TIMES REPENTED THE ASCENDENCY WHICH HE HAD PERMITTED THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TO ACQUIRE OVER HIM AND WHICH EXEMPTED THE LATTER FROM ANY OBSERVANCE OF ETIQUETTE TOWARDS HIM
HE DID NOT HURRY BUT SIMPLY CAME AT THE SUMMONS
I AM NO LONGER A MAID OF HONOR OF MADAME'S AT LEAST HAVE YOU GIVEN IN YOUR RESIGNATION MADEMOISELLE
I OFFER MY LIFE AS A SACRIFICE FOR HAVING LOVED YOU TOO TENDERLY AND I DIE DESPAIRING YOU OH CRIED RAOUL TERRIFIED AT THE ACCENTS OF PROFOUND TRUTH WHICH DE GUICHE'S WORDS BETRAYED I WAS RIGHT IN SAYING YOU WERE MAD GUICHE YES YES EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE FOLLOWING OUT HIS OWN IDEA
WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED
THE POOR LOVERS MUST WAIT UNTIL THE KING IS PLEASED TO CHANGE HIS OPINION
I FEEL THERE IS STILL ROOM IN MY HEART FOR A GENTLER AND NOBLER SENTIMENT THAN LOVE THE QUEEN-MOTHER LOOKED AT HIM AND PRESSED HIS HAND
YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND THEN YES THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
THEREFORE IN ORDER TO BE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR OWN CHIVALROUS NOTIONS YOU WILL AT ONCE APOLOGIZE TO M
FOR MADAME THE HEROINE OF THE FETE REPLIED TO THE ADDRESSES OF THE DEPUTATIONS FROM UNKNOWN RACES--GARAMANTHS SCYTHIANS HYPERBOREANS CAUCASIANS AND PATAGONIANS WHO SEEMED TO ISSUE FROM THE GROUND FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPROACHING HER WITH THEIR CONGRATULATIONS
IT WAS BY NO MEANS A SLIGHT SERVICE HE HAD RENDERED THE SOCIETY BY DENOUNCING THIS PONTIFICAL PROJECT
WELL MADAME SAID LA VALLIERE STARTING DID YOU SPEAK YOU DO NOT APPEAR TO BE LISTENING MY CHILD NO MADAME I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT A THOUSAND THINGS YOU BEAR ME NO ILL-WILL AT LEAST LOUISE CRIED MONTALAIS PRESSING HER HAND
HE WAS ABOUT TO ASSUME AN AIR OF PROTECTION TOWARDS US BUT HE IS OBLIGED TO PROSTRATE HIMSELF ONCE MORE
YOU'RE RIGHT LET ME ACT REPLIED ARAMIS
AT ALL EVENTS SINCE THESE MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND SCOLDINGS THE KING HAS NOT ADDRESSED A WORD HAS NOT PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS WELL WHAT NEXT SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN TAKEN UP WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
REFLECT LOUISE WHEN YOU ARE CONCERNED
PHILIP SHE SAID YOUR JEALOUSY IS NOT MERELY A DEFECT IT IS A DISEASE WHETHER A DEFECT OR A DISEASE MADAME I AM THE SUFFERER FROM IT AND DO YOU IMAGINE THAT A COMPLAINT WHICH EXISTS ONLY IN YOUR OWN IMAGINATION CAN BE CURED
YES THE LETTER IS FINISHED SEALED AND HER ROYAL HIGHNESS IS READY TO RECEIVE YOU RAOUL AT THIS REMARK HARDLY GAVE HIMSELF TIME TO SALUTE ATHENAIS CAST ONE LOOK AT LOUISE BOWED TO MONTALAIS AND WITHDREW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHATEAU
CHAPTER XI
IT IS A DISGRACEFUL SUSPICION AND UNWORTHY A GENTLEMAN
THE YOUNG GIRL'S DISPOSITION IS GENEROSITY ITSELF
THE KING AT THE SUGGESTION LISTENED WITH RENEWED ATTENTION AND IMMEDIATELY LOOKING AROUND HIM SAID IS MONSIEUR FOUQUET NO LONGER HERE YES SIRE I AM HERE REPLIED THE SUPERINTENDENT TILL THEN ENGAGED WITH BUCKINGHAM AND APPROACHED THE KING WHO ADVANCED A STEP TOWARDS HIM WITH A SMILING YET NEGLIGENT AIR
YOU KNOW MADAME SAID PHILIP DOLEFULLY WHETHER I HAD OR HAD NOT A VERY GREAT DISLIKE TO GETTING MARRIED NOW INDEED YOU ALARM ME
IT BELONGS TO YOU I BELIEVE M
I WILL BUT FASTEN MY CLOAK AND SHALL THEN BE READY TO SERVE YOU NOT ONLY AS A GUIDE BUT AS YOUR INTRODUCER TOO CHAPTER XIV
WHEN I DINE ALONE I HAVE MY GENTLEMEN
AT THIS MOMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO YOUNG MEN RAOUL ENTERED LOOKING FULL OF ANXIETY
HE THEN BRINGS TO THE KING'S ATTENTION THAT FOUQUET IS FORTIFYING THE ISLAND OF BELLE-ILE-EN-MER AND COULD POSSIBLY BE PLANNING TO USE IT AS A BASE FOR SOME MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST THE KING
THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS THROAT AND HIS HEAD AND GUSHED FROM HIS MOUTH HIS NOSTRILS AND HIS EYES
A FIRE-EATER
I WILL ASK BRAGELONNE TO TELL ME BRAGELONNE SAID ATHENAIS
THIS SECOND PLACE MURMURED MALICORNE WHILST DRYING HIS PAPER WHICH AT FIRST GLANCE APPEARS TO COST ME MORE THAN THE FIRST BUT HE STOPPED TOOK UP THE PEN IN HIS TURN AND WROTE TO MONTALAIS MADEMOISELLE,--ANNOUNCE TO YOUR FRIEND THAT HER COMMISSION WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE IT ARRIVES
I HIT YOU AND MY BROTHER AT THE SAME TIME CHALAIS AND LA VALLIERE YOUR AFFIANCED BRIDE AND HIS FUTURE LADY LOVE REALLY MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE COMTE YOU ARE IN A MOST BRILLIANT HUMOR TO-DAY THE FACT IS I FEEL WELL AND THEN I AM PLEASED TO SEE YOU AGAIN
WAS IT NOT YOUR MAJESTY
OR IF YOU PREFER IT I WILL RUN MY DAGGER THROUGH YOUR THROAT IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HERE
I APPEAL TO LOUISE M
AND IT IS DELIGHTFUL TOO TO SEE A YOUNG MAN AT AN AGE WHEN MEN FROM HABIT BECOME THE DESTROYERS OF THE HONOR OF WOMEN RESPECT AND DEFEND IT DE WARDES BIT HIS LIP AND CLENCHED HIS HANDS EVIDENTLY MUCH DISTURBED TO LEARN HOW THIS DISCOURSE THE COMMENCEMENT OF WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED IN SO THREATENING A MANNER WOULD TERMINATE
NEITHER OF THEM SPOKE
THE CHEVALIER RESIGNED HIMSELF AND ONCE RESIGNED GAVE HIS ENTIRE ATTENTION TO FOUQUET:--"YOU ARRIVE LATE MONSIEUR HE SAID
AFTER HE HAD FULFILLED THIS ENGAGEMENT RAOUL APPROACHED DE GUICHE WHO AS IF IN CONTRAST WITH HIS MAGNIFICENT COSTUME EXHIBITED A COUNTENANCE SO UTTERLY DEJECTED THAT THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WAS THE ONLY ONE PRESENT WHO COULD CONTEND WITH HIM AS FAR AS PALLOR AND DISCOMFITURE WERE CONCERNED
HE HAD NOT BEEN EITHER SEEN OR HEARD
WHILE THE COMTE DE LA FERE WAS PROCEEDING ON HIS WAY TO PAIRS ACCOMPANIED BY RAOUL THE PALAIS ROYAL WAS THE THEATRE WHEREIN A SCENE OF WHAT MOLIERE WOULD HAVE CALLED EXCELLENT COMEDY WAS BEING PERFORMED
YOU WORTHLESS
A SUBJECT NO
MONSIEUR LE COMTE WHAT A DEBT OF GRATITUDE SHALL I NOT OWE YOU SAID MALICORNE TRANSPORTED
THE RESULT OF THEIR DISCERNMENT WAS THAT HIS ORDERS WERE EXECUTED WITH THAT EXACTITUDE OF MANEUVER WHICH IS FOUND ON BOARD A MAN-OF-WAR COMMANDED DURING A STORM BY AN ILL-TEMPERED CAPTAIN
AND YET LOUIS XIV A FEW YEARS PREVIOUSLY HAD NOT EVEN CONDESCENDED TO OFFER HIS HAND TO THAT UGLY GIRL FOR A BALLET
HOWEVER I WILL PUT MY QUESTIONS IN A MORE PRECISE MANNER IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE TO EVADE THEM
I CANNOT CONCEIVE YOUR MEANING SERIOUSLY THEN DEAR M
I KNOW YOU WELL
THE KING COULD NOT RESIST TURNING ROUND TO LOOK AT THEM AGAIN
YOU HAVE THEN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES AT THE INTENDANCE COLBERT SUFFOCATED BOWED BUT MADE NO REPLY
YES MY LORD THE DUKE CLASPED HIS HANDS WITH A TERRIFIED GESTURE WHICH COULD NOT FAIL OF ITS EFFECT UPON THE QUEEN ALREADY DISPOSED TO SOFTER FEELINGS BY THE TENDERNESS OF HER OWN RECOLLECTIONS
HAS SHE NO DRESSES THEN AND SHE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS LIKE A WOMAN WHO HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE INCONVENIENCES OF A SLENDERLY FILLED PURSE
THIS NAME HAD A CERTAIN EFFECT UPON THE KING
NO NO HE EXCLAIMED IN A STATE OF DESPERATION WHO THE DEUCE IS SPEAKING OF M
ACCORDING AS HE BE SINCERE OR HYPOCRITICAL AND THE FETE WILL TAKE PLACE IN A MONTH HE INVITED HIMSELF YOU SAY WITH A PERTINACITY IN WHICH I DETECTED COLBERT'S INFLUENCE
THE LADIES PRESENT VISIBLY DISPLAYED THEIR IMPATIENCE TO SEE SUCH A TREASURE MONOPOLIZED BY THE GENTLEMEN
D'ARTAGNAN THIS IS VERY STRANGE MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN
OR IN OTHER WORDS BY DENYING AN EXPLANATION
MONSIEUR COMPLAINS SAID THE KING THAT YOU PREFER THE SOCIETY OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO HIS OWN CONVERSATION AND SOCIETY BUT MONSIEUR PASSES HIS LIFE IN LOOKING AT HIS FACE IN THE GLASS AND IN PLOTTING ALL SORTS OF SPITEFUL THINGS AGAINST WOMEN WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE OH YOU ARE GOING SOMEWHAT TOO FAR I ONLY TELL YOU WHAT IS TRUE
HE REMARKED BUCKINGHAM RETIRE HEARD HIS DEEP SIGH AND SAW HIM PASS A HAND OVER HIS FACE
THIS CONDUCT WHICH EVERY ONE HAD OBSERVED HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY REMARKED BY THE EVIL GENIUS OF THE HOUSE THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE FOR WHOM MONSIEUR EXHIBITED THE WARMEST ATTACHMENT BECAUSE HE WAS OF A VERY CHEERFUL DISPOSITION EVEN IN HIS REMARKS MOST FULL OF MALICE AND BECAUSE HE WAS NEVER AT A LOSS HOW TO WILE THE TIME AWAY
YOU THINK HE LOVES HER
WHO IS IT I KNOW A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN WHO IS ON VERY GOOD TERMS WITH A CERTAIN YOUNG LADY THERE ONE OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR YES SIRE WITH MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE I SUPPOSE SAID THE KING LAUGHING
RAOUL QUITTED THE PALAIS ROYAL FULL OF IDEAS THAT ADMITTED NO DELAY IN EXECUTION
A VISIT FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS NOT AN ORDINARY EVENT IN THE LIFE OF ANY WOMAN ATTACHED TO THE COURT
SIRE IT IS THE VOICE OF HEAVEN IN ANGER BE IT SO SAID THE KING
THIS BRILLIANT AND ANIMATED COMPANY THE MEMBERS OF WHICH WERE INSPIRED BY VARIOUS FEELINGS ARRIVED AT LE HAVRE FOUR DAYS AFTER THEIR DEPARTURE FROM PARIS
AND AS A FEW SPARSE DROPS OF RAIN CONTINUED TO FALL--A LAST ADIEU OF THE VANISHING STORM--THE OTHER LADIES WHOM RESPECT HAD PREVENTED FROM GETTING INTO THEIR CARRIAGES BEFORE THE KING REMAINED ALTOGETHER UNPROTECTED BY HOOD OR CLOAK EXPOSED TO THE RAIN FROM WHICH THE KING WAS PROTECTING AS WELL AS HE WAS ABLE THE HUMBLEST AMONG THEM
BUT BEAUTIFUL I THINK IN SPITE OF THAT IS THAT YOUR OPINION SIRE YES REALLY VERY WELL
THE KING HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HE WAS PAYING HER A VISIT IN ORDER TO SAY TO HER WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BROTHER AND HE WAS REDUCED TO WEAKLY ASKING HER WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO ME REPLIED MADAME
THE YOUNG LADY DOES NOT SEEM TO ME TO BE VERY PRETTY COMTE I AM NOT QUITE SURE REPLIED ATHOS
WHO WAS IT THAT HAD DARED TO CALCULATE THE POSSIBILITY OF COMMITTING A CRIME AGAINST THE MARRIAGE VOW--A CRIME TOO STILL MORE DEPLORABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM
NEVER A SYLLABLE OF DISCLOSURE NEVER A MOMENT'S FORGETFULNESS
AY BUT LOOK YOU I WAS EXPECTING MONEY AND INSTEAD OF MONEY I SEE YOU AND SUPPOSE I BROUGHT YOU SOME MONEY OH
I AM DESIROUS OF PLACING SOME MONEY IN YOUR HANDS AND NATURALLY I WISH TO KNOW IF YOU ARE CERTAIN OF YOUR POST REALLY MARQUISE I AM AT A LOSS WHAT TO REPLY
RAOUL COULD NOT RESIST SMILING AS THINKING OF MADAME HE SAID TO HIMSELF HERS IS INDEED A HEART WELL BESIEGED AND THEN ADDED COMPASSIONATELY AS HE THOUGHT OF MONSIEUR AND HE IS A HUSBAND WELL THREATENED TOO
FOR IF PROTECTION BE EXTENDED TOWARDS YOU MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS,--FOR WHICH INDEED SO MANY REASONS EXIST ADDED RAOUL BOWING I DO NOT SEE THAT THE SAME REASONS EXIST WHY MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SHOULD BE SIMILARLY CARED FOR BUT M
WHY WHAT THE DEUCE DID YOU DO OR SAY TO MADAME REALLY MONSEIGNEUR WOMEN I KNOW HAVE THEIR GRUDGES AND MY WIFE IS NOT FREE FROM CAPRICES OF THAT NATURE
WITHOUT BEING A COURTIER D'ARTAGNAN HAD A GLANCE AS SURE AND AS RAPID AS IF HE HAD BEEN ONE
GUICHE GROANED IN DESPAIR AND WOULD HAVE SHOWN IT MORE VIOLENTLY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ADVICE DE BRAGELONNE GAVE HIM
LET HIM BE PURSUED LET HIM BE CAPTURED NAY NAY WHISPERED ARAMIS TAKING HIM BY THE HAND BE CALM THE EVIL IS DONE THE VALET QUIETLY WENT OUT
TELL ME THE APPOINTMENT OF A MAID OF HONOR OH
FOUQUET I SHOULD THINK MUST CERTAINLY HAVE FOUR MILLIONS SHE REPLIED COURAGEOUSLY
DO YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER FINISH FOR ME AND YOU LOUISE SAID MONTALAIS DOES ANY ONE PLEASE YOU THAT IS A MATTER THAT CONCERNS NO ONE BUT MYSELF REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL RISING FROM THE MOSSY BANK ON WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RECLINING DURING THE WHOLE TIME THE BALLET LASTED
COLBERT SAID HE WOULD WAIT UPON YOUR MAJESTY AS SOON AS YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD MANIFEST AN INTENTION OF CARRYING OUT THE FETES OF WHICH HE HAS FURNISHED THE PROGRAMME LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS RAOUL ENTERED MADAME'S APARTMENTS AS MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS HAD BEGGED HIM TO DO
BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL THE DUKE THAT I SHALL BE CHARMED IF HE WILL PAY ME A VISIT PHILIP KISSED HIS MOTHER'S HAND AND STARTED OFF TO FIND THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
AND I THEREFORE WISHED TO SATISFY MYSELF BY OTHER OPINIONS BESIDE MY OWN AND AS MY NAIAD WHO IN HER CHARACTER OF A GODDESS IS POLYGLOT,--IS NOT THAT THE EXPRESSION M
SAINT-AIGNAN ON LEAVING GUICHE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE GROVE,--AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE THE OUTBUILDINGS OF THE SERVANTS BEGIN AND WHERE BEHIND THE THICKETS OF ACACIAS AND CHESTNUT-TREES INTERLACING THEIR BRANCHES WHICH WERE HIDDEN BY MASSES OF CLEMATIS AND YOUNG VINES THE WALL WHICH SEPARATED THE WOODS FROM THE COURTYARD WAS ERECTED
DE LORRAINE'S JEALOUSY
IT IS A MARRIAGE SIMILAR TO MANY OTHERS WHICH ALREADY EXIST AT COURT
SAINT-AIGNAN THEREFORE WENT IN QUEST OF HIM AND AFTER HAVING TURNED AND TWISTED AND SEARCHED IN EVERY DIRECTION HE PERCEIVED SOMETHING LIKE A HUMAN FORM LEANING AGAINST A TREE
SIRE A MAN HAS IN A MOST COWARDLY WAY INSULTED M
WHEN YOU WERE IN EXILE--FOR YOU REALLY WERE EXILED MY POOR DE GUICHE I SHOULD THINK SO INDEED
SWORD-THRUSTS IN THE WATER CONCLUDED D'ARTAGNAN'S APARTMENT WAS NOT UNOCCUPIED
I AM GOING TO ENGLAND TO FULFIL A MISSION WHICH HIS MAJESTY HAS BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO CONFIDE TO ME--NOTHING MORE AND YOU PROPOSE TO RETURN TO FRANCE AS SOON AS I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MY MISSION
THE NOBLE CHARACTER OF THE YOUNG MAN'S COUNTENANCE EXPRESSED A DISPLEASURE WHICH COULD EASILY BE READ
LOUIS'S WAVING HAIR FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS THE FRESHNESS OF HIS COMPLEXION WAS ENHANCED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BLUE EYES WHICH SOFTLY KINDLED ALL HEARTS
YES INDEED CONTINUED THE PRINCESS AND SHE DID SO IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE TO ME MANY PARTICULARS MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN HAS OMITTED IN HIS RECITAL PRAY RELATE THEM YOURSELF THEN SAID MONSIEUR YOU CAN RELATE STORIES IN SUCH A CHARMING MANNER THE PRINCESS BOWED AT THE CONJUGAL COMPLIMENT PAID HER
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT VANNES IS IN THE DIOCESE OF BELLE-ISLE OR BELLE-ISLE IN THE DIOCESE OF VANNES
HE ALSO WAS BREATHING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRINCESS'S APARTMENT HIS PRAYERS AND THE WILD VISIONS OF HIS LOVE
IT IS MADEMOISELLE LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE MADAME COULD NOT RESTRAIN AN EXCLAMATION IN WHICH A FEELING STRONGER THAN SURPRISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DETECTED
BESIDES SAID MONTALAIS IT IS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT IT SUITED ME
IN THE THREE-VOLUME EDITION VOLUME 1 ENTITLED THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE ENDS HERE FOOTNOTE 2
THE KING HURRIEDLY OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED THE ROOM
YOU WISH IT TO BE SAID YOU ARE RIGHT IN BEING JEALOUS WHEN THERE IS NO GROUND WHATEVER FOR YOUR JEALOUSY OF COURSE YOU WILL BEGIN TO SAY FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID ON THE BEHALF OF THE OTHER BECAUSE PHILIP SAID THE QUEEN DRYLY WHAT YOU DID FOR THE OTHER YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR THIS ONE THE PRINCE BOWED SLIGHTLY ANNOYED
A MONTH SHE REPEATED
WELL SAID HE TO D'ARTAGNAN AS HE SAW HIM ENTER
COME CONFESS SAID MONTALAIS
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE HIM ONCE WITHOUT ALWAYS REMEMBERING HIM
WELL REPLIED THE KING LET THEM COME
COME COME GIVE HIM YOUR HAND MADAME SAID PHILIP
IS NOT THAT WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO PRECISELY
THE KING HIMSELF WILL INFORM YOU TO-MORROW MORNING THAT IT IS NOT BAD NEWS THE KING HAS NOT SIGNED HOWEVER THE KING WISHES HIMSELF TO SETTLE THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND HE DESIRES TO MAKE IT SO GRAND THAT HE REQUIRES TIME FOR CONSIDERATION
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE THEREFORE HAVING NOTICED THAT HE WAS THREATENED WITH BEING SUPPLANTED BY DE GUICHE RESORTED TO STRONG MEASURES
WHY SO BECAUSE THE DEAR DUKE SAVES A SWORD-THRUST BY IT AT WHICH REPLY BOTH LAUGHED
ARAMIS AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID HAD NOT RETIRED
TO THE SUPERINTENDENT HE SAID
HE WAS EXPECTING A USURER AND SAW MALICORNE ENTER
YOU SAID A FEW WORDS BUT DE GUICHE SHOWED THE MOST JEALOUSY I SHOULD THINK SO CONTINUED THE CHEVALIER IN THE SAME TONE
STILL DO NOT THE TURNKEYS TALK WITH YOUR PRISONERS OF COURSE THE PRISONERS I SUPPOSE TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT GUILTY THEY ARE ALWAYS TELLING THEM THAT
KNOWING HERSELF TO BE VERY ILL AND CONDEMNED BY HER SUFFERINGS TO FREQUENT RETIREMENT SHE WAS DISTRESSED AT THE IDEA THAT THE GREATER PART OF HER FUTURE DAYS AND EVENINGS WOULD PASS AWAY SOLITARY USELESS AND IN DESPONDENCY
THE THREE YOUNG GIRLS ON THEIR SIDE REACHED THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE PARK EVERY PATH OF WHICH THEY WELL KNEW
THERE IS NO OCCASION TO HURRY YET HE SAID
MADAME CRIED DE GUICHE THE PRESENT IS A MOMENT FOR ME IN WHICH NO OTHER CONSIDERATION AND NO OTHER RESPECT EXIST THAN THE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT OF A MAN OF HONOR TOWARDS THE WOMAN HE WORSHIPS
HE ADVANCED A STEP TOWARDS RAOUL AND IN AN ALMOST UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE SAID,--"I OFFER MY APOLOGIES IN THE TERMS WHICH M
IT IS STRANGE PURSUED RAOUL LOOKING AT THE YOUNG GIRL WITH A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION
EVERY ONE BEGAN TO LAUGH AND TO CRY OUT
HOW DELIGHTED I AM TO SEE YOUR GRACE HUSH
NOT ONLY SO HE VERY OFTEN INVENTS
BUT IF I SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THE APPOINTMENT YOU AND NOT HE WILL HAVE BESTOWED IT ON ME BESIDES HE WILL NOT HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU FOR NOTHING I SUPPOSE
GENTLEMEN GENTLEMEN SAID THE KING WHOM NOTHING ESCAPED ONE WOULD ALMOST THINK THAT YOU WORE BRACELETS AS THE SABINES USED TO DO
WIT AND HUMOR ESCAPED FROM HER SCARLET LIPS LIKE PERSUASION FROM THE LIPS OF NESTOR OF OLD
MALICORNE SAID DE GUICHE TO HIS FRIEND
MALICORNE WHO IS ALL-POWERFUL AT COURT AH
D'ARTAGNAN PUT RAOUL ASIDE SAYING,--"DO NOT INTERRUPT ME YOUNG MAN AND LOOKING AT DE WARDES IN AN AUTHORITATIVE MANNER HE CONTINUED:--"I AM NOW DEALING WITH A MATTER WHICH CANNOT BE SETTLED BY MEANS OF THE SWORD
ALSO THE THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES WHILE ENTITLED THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE HAS THE SUBTITLE TEN YEARS LATER
DE SAINT-AIGNAN EVERY ONE WISHES TO GET HOLD OF OUR SECRET
IT IS BY HIS MAJESTY THEREFORE THAT YOU MUST BE INVITED A MURMUR OF DELIGHT IMMEDIATELY AROSE
DECIDE BETWEEN US--BETWEEN DE WARDES AND MYSELF RAOUL UPON WHAT SUBJECT UPON THE SUBJECT OF NOBLE BIRTH WHO CAN BE BETTER INFORMED ON THAT SUBJECT THAN A DE GRAMONT NO COMPLIMENTS
THAT MALICORNE NEVER ASKED FOR A MEETING BUT ON THE CONTRARY REQUIRED TO BE SUPPLICATED TO RECEIVE THE FAVORS HE BURNED TO OBTAIN
ITS PORTS CONTAIN THREE CORSAIRS
THE SIDE STREET IN QUESTION WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE RUE DE LYON DOUBTLESS BECAUSE GEOGRAPHICALLY IT LED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SECOND CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
IT WAS WITH THIS HOPE AND WITH THIS FEAR THAT LOUIS AUTHORIZED SAINT-AIGNAN TO SKETCH THE PORTRAITS OF THE SHEPHERDESSES PHYLLIS AMARYLLIS AND GALATEA
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MYSELF IF I HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR ANY ONE BUT SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR OTHERS IF I REVENGE MYSELF UPON THEM FOR IT YOU ARE RIGHT SAID ATHENAIS AND PERHAPS YOU TOO WILL REACH THE GOAL
IN WHAT CHARACTER AS THE ENGINEER OF BELLE-ISLE OF COURSE IS IT POSSIBLE QUITE TRUE SHALL WE NOT BE OBLIGED THEN TO SEND HIM BACK TO BELLE-ISLE MOST CERTAINLY
RAOUL IS NOT HERE
UPON MY WORD THIS IS NOT THE SORT OF LIFE FOR ANY ONE TO LEAD WHO IS NEITHER A SQUIRREL A SALAMANDER NOR AN OTTER
THE SAME CEREMONY WAS OBSERVED FOR THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF AS WITH A SUSPECTED STRANGER
THE COMTE DE LA FERE HAD SOLICITED FROM ME MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S HAND FOR HIS SON
CHAPTER XXIII
GOOD HEAVENS EXPLAINED TONNAY-CHARENTE HOW HAPPY THAT LA VALLIERE IS
IT IS NOT THEREFORE FOR MYSELF THAT I FEAR ANY INTERPRETATIONS THAT MAY BE MADE FOR WHOM THEN FOR YOU SIRE FOR ME SAID THE KING SMILING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU HAS YOUR MAJESTY ALREADY FORGOTTEN WHAT TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY EVENING IN HER ROYAL HIGHNESS'S APARTMENTS OH
MANICAMP DREW BACK AND IT WAS NOW MALICORNE'S TURN WHO APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD TO SCRATCH HIS EAR
A STRATEGIC RETREAT SAID DE WARDES
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID SO FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AND THAT MADAME DID NOT WITHDRAW HER HAND TOO QUICKLY FOR THE DUKE ADDED
RAPID FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
WHAT IS THE MATTER INQUIRED MADAME TERRIFIED
FOR YOU HAVE THE HEART OF A VIPER M
REMAIN KING
BUT AS THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING SINISTER AT THE BOTTOM OF ANY DELIGHT EXPRESSED BY COLBERT LOUIS PREFERRED OF THE SMILES OF THE TWO MEN THAT OF FOUQUET
D'ARTAGNAN DELIGHTED SIRE THE KING TOUCHED HIS BELL AND AN USHER APPEARED
HE EXPERIENCED THIS PLEASURE THEN BUT NOTHING MORE AND HIS HEART WAS NOT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT ALARMED AT WHAT MADAME MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT THINK OF HIS ADVENTURE
WHERE CAN THE CHEVALIER BE SAID HE
BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE ALLOW ME TO PREFACE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY WITH ONE REMARK
BUT WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS MORE IMPORTANT IT CANNOT BE SIRE
MONSIEUR HAS LOST EVERYTHING IN MY ESTIMATION SINCE HE HAS SHOWN ME HE CAN BE A TYRANT TO A WOMAN NAY NAY MY BROTHER'S ONLY FAULT IS THAT OF LOVING YOU LOVE ME
I HAVE NEVER EVEN LEFT MY OWN HOUSE SINCE THE DUKE HAS BEEN AT PARIS OH RESUMED MADAME VANEL STRETCHING OUT HER FOOT TOWARDS A PAPER WHICH WAS LYING ON THE CARPET NEAR THE WINDOW
WE REGARD THOSE RICH AND POWERFUL NATURES AS LIKE THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCING GOOD AND EVIL AT THE SAME TIME
HE APPROACHED THE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DUKE OF NORFOLK AND IN A VOICE WHICH ILL CONCEALED HIS IMPATIENCE SAID IT IS NOW TIME TO DISEMBARK YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THE YOUNGER OF THE PRINCESSES ROSE FROM HER SEAT AT THIS REMARK AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE THE HAND WHICH THE YOUNG NOBLEMAN EXTENDED TO HER WITH AN EAGERNESS WHICH AROSE FROM A VARIETY OF MOTIVES WHEN THE ADMIRAL INTERVENED BETWEEN THEM OBSERVING
AND MOREOVER FROM ONE OR THE OTHER OF THOSE THREE GRACES WE SHALL LEARN THE NAMES OF THE REST AND BY THE NAMES THEIR SECRETS I TOO SAID THE KING ONLY REQUIRE TO HEAR HER VOICE TO KNOW IT AGAIN
MADAME HE SAID KISSING HIS WIFE'S HAND THERE IS SOME ONE PRESENT HERE WHO HAS FALLEN INTO DISGRACE AN UNHAPPY EXILE WHOM I VENTURE TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR KINDNESS
BUT CERTAINLY A CIPHER FOR HIS FRIENDS
HE OFTEN ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS TO TALK TO HIM EITHER OF HIS FATHER OR OF D'ARTAGNAN THEIR MUTUAL FRIEND IN WHOSE PRAISE BUCKINGHAM WAS NEARLY AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS RAOUL
ALLOW ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE DANGER WILL NOT BE GREATER FOR THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES WHEN THE WIND WILL BE IN THEIR FAVOR THESE ENVOYS HAVE SHOWN HOW GREAT THEIR COURAGE IS SAID THE ADMIRAL
FOUQUET ADVANCE SIX MILLIONS
WE HAVE TIME ENOUGH YOU KILL ME D'HERBLAY WITH YOUR CALMNESS SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT PASSING HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS FACE
WE SHALL SOON LEARN IF ONE CAN OVERHEAR REPLIED MADAME
MORE DANCING AND GUICHE HIMSELF--HE WAS CONCEALED THERE ANNE OF AUSTRIA FROWNED
MADAME WAS LAUGHTER-LOVING AND UNRESERVED IN HER MANNERS
THAT IS NOT MY FAULT SAID THE DUKE
DE BRAGELONNE AND MYSELF AWAIT HER MAJESTY'S ORDERS
TO THE MAN WITHOUT COMPASSION WAS UNITED A WOMAN WITHOUT HEART
HER DEEP MUSINGS MELANCHOLY THOUGH THEY WERE WERE NOT UNTINGED WITH A CERTAIN VAGUE JOY
YOU ARE A JUDGE OF HORSES I PERCEIVE THEN TURNING TOWARDS HIM AGAIN HE CONTINUED YOU ARE MOST BECOMINGLY DRESSED M
LA VALLIERE INSTINCTIVELY FELT HERSELF SINKING BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT LOOKS INSPIRED SOME BY INTEREST OTHERS BY ENVY
THE BOAT WAS DESTINED FOR THE TRANSPORT OF THE DUKE'S EQUIPAGES FROM THE SHORE TO THE YACHT
WE ARE JESTING LOUISE AND ARE NOT I ASSURE YOU QUITE THE MONSTERS YOU SUPPOSE
D'ARTAGNAN'S LIFE
YES HE SAID IT IS INDEED M
YOUR DREAM SAID MADAME JOYOUSLY IN THE EAR OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA
MONTALAIS WITH MORE COURAGE ADVANCED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LOUISE AND RECEIVED HER FROM THE KING'S HANDS WHO WAS ALREADY FAST LOSING HIS PRESENCE OF MIND AS HE FELT HIS FACE COVERED BY THE PERFUMED TRESSES OF THE SEEMINGLY DYING GIRL
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO SHE SAID
SHE OF WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING COVERED WITH SHAME BORNE DOWN BY THE AFFRONT YOU BROUGHT UPON HER FLED QUITTED FRANCE AND NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT BECAME OF HER STAY SAID THE COMTE DE LA FERE STRETCHING HIS HAND TOWARDS DE WARDES WITH A PECULIAR SMILE UPON HIS FACE YOU ARE MISTAKEN
BESIDES YOUR EXILE STARTED A PROJECT IN MY HEAD GOOD WHEN THE CHEVALIER--FINDING YOU WERE NO LONGER HERE AND SURE OF REIGNING UNDISTURBED--BEGAN TO BULLY ME I OBSERVING THAT MY WIFE IN THE MOST PERFECT CONTRAST TO HIM WAS MOST KIND AND AMIABLE TOWARDS ME WHO HAD NEGLECTED HER SO MUCH THE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME OF BECOMING A MODEL HUSBAND--A RARITY A CURIOSITY AT THE COURT
IN EIGHT DAYS M
WE HAVE SAID IT WAS FOURTEEN LEAGUES TO ETAMPES YES AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES BACK DOUBTLESS WELL
EVEN IF YOU SPENT AS MUCH AS BUCKINGHAM THERE IS ONLY NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS DIFFERENCE WHERE AM I TO FIND THEM GET INTO DEBT I AM IN DEBT ALREADY A GREATER REASON FOR GETTING FURTHER ADVICE LIKE THIS RESULTED IN DE GUICHE BECOMING EXCITED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE COMMITTED EXTRAVAGANCES WHERE BUCKINGHAM ONLY INCURRED EXPENSES
CHAPTER LXII
I AM EVEN THINKING OF SENDING HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
VILLIERS
AS MUCH FOR BED AND SUPPER THAT MAKES SIXTY LIVRES THIS COMPLAISANCE WOULD COST MANICAMP STRETCHED HIMSELF LIKE A SERPENT IN HIS BED AND FIXING HIS TWO GREAT EYES UPON MALICORNE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HE
ANY OTHER WOMAN IN YOUR PLACE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME OH
IF I AM TO DIE OF IT I SHALL DIE OF IT AND THEN I SHALL NEED NOTHING FURTHER BUT WHAT NEED IS THERE TO DIE SAID RAOUL
AND WHAT A DELIGHTFUL STORY IT WILL BE TOO FOR HIM TO WHOM I AM REALLY ATTACHED IN FACT PART OF MY DOWRY FOR MY HUSBAND TO HAVE THE ADVENTURE TO RELATE OF THE MONARCH WHO WAS SO AMUSINGLY DECEIVED BY A YOUNG GIRL SIRE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE HER MIND BEWILDERED ALMOST WANDERING INDEED NOT ANOTHER WORD I IMPLORE YOU
FOUQUET BY NAME AND COULD NOT CONCEIVE WHAT BUSINESS SHE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE WITH A SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES
UNFORTUNATELY MADAME WAS ALONE
A WOMAN SAID ARAMIS
IS NOT M
AND CONSEQUENTLY IT DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT EITHER UPON THOSE WHO FROM DUTY OR INCLINATION APPLAUDED IT TO THE VERY ECHO OR ON THE KING HIMSELF TO WHOM FLATTERY WAS VERY AGREEABLE WHEN DELICATELY CONVEYED AND WHOM INDEED IT DID NOT ALWAYS DISPLEASE EVEN WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE TOO BROAD
HE ASKED HIMSELF TOO HOW IT WAS THAT MANICAMP WHO IN HIS OPINION MUST BE A MAN TO BE LOOKED UPON WITH VENERATION BY EVERYBODY HAVING WISHED TO BAIT HIS HORSE AT THE BEAU PAON ON ARRIVING THERE BOTH HORSE AND RIDER HAD BEEN INCONTINENTLY TURNED AWAY WITH A NESCIO VOS OF THE MOST POSITIVE CHARACTER
DE MONTESPAN A TRUCE TO RAILLERY
BY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING EVERY ONE HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE QUEEN-MOTHER'S APARTMENTS
GO GO
GO GO
YOU ALWAYS FLATTER ME ELISE
FOUQUET TOOK HIS LEAVE AT A QUARTER TO THREE IN THE MORNING AND THE KING WENT TO BED A LITTLE UNEASY AND CONFUSED AT THE INDIRECT LESSON HE HAD RECEIVED
SHE KNEW BUT TOO WELL THIS BRILLIANT RECEPTION WAS PAID TO THE HAPPY MOTHER OF A KING RESTORED TO HIS THRONE A THRONE SECOND TO NONE IN EUROPE WHILE THE WORSE THAN INDIFFERENT RECEPTION SHE HAD BEFORE MET WITH WAS PAID TO HER THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY IV AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING BEEN UNFORTUNATE
WHEN MY FRIEND ARRIVES HE WILL OCCUPY THE LARGE APARTMENT
AND THERE ARE PERSONS EVEN NOW PRESENT WHO HAVING OFTEN HEARD HER SPOKEN OF WILL EASILY RECOGNIZE HER BY THE DESCRIPTION I AM ABOUT TO GIVE
I AM VERY HAPPY SAID THE DUKE TO FIND MYSELF TREATED AS A STRANGER HERE MADAME AND HE LEFT THE ROOM IN A PASSION
RAOUL WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OR THREE GENTLEMEN
THE SPANISH CARDINAL NO ONE ELSE
AND THEN TOO HE KISSED HER HANDS AND CHEEKS IN THE MOST CHILDLIKE AND ENDEARING MANNER AND HAD ALWAYS SOME SWEETMEATS TO OFFER HER OR SOME NEW STYLE OF DRESS TO RECOMMEND
THE HONORS OF THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE ARE BEING PAID TO YOUR WIFE AND YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED THE DUKE OF ORLEANS DREADED THE SATIRICAL HUMOR OF THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WHENEVER IT REACHED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF BITTERNESS AND HE CHANGED THE CONVERSATION ABRUPTLY
TEN PAGES AND A DOZEN MOUNTED TROOPERS FOR AN ESCORT MOUNTED GUARD BEFORE THE TENTS
AND IT REALLY SEEMS TO ME CONTINUED THE KING THAT WE HAVE NEVER GIVEN ANY GROUND NEVER
WELL I CAN UNDERSTAND IT
THE FIRST WORD OF LOUIS TO HIS MUSKETEER AS IF HE WISHED IT TO CONTRAST WITH WHAT HE WAS SAYING AT THE MOMENT WAS A KIND GOOD DAY HIS SECOND WAS TO SEND AWAY COLBERT
I HAVE RECEIVED HIS REPLY AND YOU BELONG TO ME FROM THIS MORNING
HIS GRACE CANNOT BE IN HIS SENSES SAID THE ADMIRAL ALOUD TO RAOUL
A GREATER REASON THEREFORE FOR SENSIBLE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES TO DO SO THERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR DREAMS AGAIN NAY RATHER WITH REALITIES
ARE YOU READY AND DE GUICHE LAUGHINGLY GAVE HIS HORSE THE REIN AND GALLOPED FORWARD A FEW YARDS
AND I FIND YOU NOW IN THE VERY ACT OF DOING WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW OF SINGING THE PRAISES OF PHYLLIS WELL I DO NOT DENY IT SAID DE GUICHE LAUGHING
BUT WHY DID YOU NOT STOP ON YOUR ROAD I WAS EXPECTED HERE AND I WAS OBLIGED TO COME EVEN AT THE RISK OF YOUR LIFE YES AT THE RISK OF DYING ON THE WAY VERY WELL
I SAID THE YOUNG QUEEN I SEEM TO TERRIFY ALL THOSE WHO AMUSE THEMSELVES AND SO DO I,--JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES REJOINED MONSIEUR
I SHALL BE ONE OF THOSE WHO WILL MEET WITH THE OTHERS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
MY WIFE WILL HAVE ALL HER MAIDS OF HONOR PRETTY
HE TOOK THE LETTER BOWED LOWLY TO THE PRINCESS AND LEFT THE ROOM
I WAS GOING TO REJOICE AT GETTING THIS COMMISSION AND THUS YOU QUENCH MY JOY GOOD
MUSIC UNINTERRUPTEDLY
SAINT-AIGNAN IN UTTER DESPAIR AT THE RIGOR WHICH BECAME ALMOST INSULTING FROM THE VERY FACT OF HER PERSISTING IN IT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE DISPLAYED TRIED TO TURN HIS BACK UPON HER
THE WEATHER WAS CLOUDY A WARM BREEZE BOWED THE FLOWERS AND THE SHRUBS THE BURNING DUST SWEPT ALONG IN CLOUDS BY THE WIND WAS WHIRLED IN EDDIES TOWARDS THE TREES
DE GUICHE IS NOT THE FIRST AGAIN I WARN YOU THAT AS A GOOD BROTHER I SHALL TAKE A DISLIKE TO DE GUICHE AH SIRE DO NOT I ENTREAT YOU ADOPT EITHER THE SYMPATHIES OR THE DISLIKES OF MONSIEUR
SURELY YOU MUST KNOW EACH OTHER SAID D'ARTAGNAN
I HAVE OFTEN LEFT YOU WHEN SETTING OFF ON ADVENTURES FRAUGHT WITH DANGER
BUT BEFORE HE CAME MALICORNE ARRIVED SAYING TO THE PRINCE MONSEIGNEUR THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE IS HERE THE DUKE LOOKED AT MALICORNE AND SMILED GRACIOUSLY AT HIM JUST AS THE CHEVALIER ENTERED
NOT FOR US POOR BRETONS SIRE REPLIED ARAMIS
MY OWN COUNTRYMAN WHO KNEW MY HABITS
FOR WHOM
NOTHING APPEASES THEM
BRAVE PASSIONATELY FOND OF DANGER I MEET A DANGER GREATER THAN MY STRENGTH AND MY COURAGE
DE MALICORNE AND RIDE HIM ROUND THE COURT TWO OR THREE TIMES THE COURTYARD OF THE HOTEL WAS SO ARRANGED THAT WHENEVER THERE WAS ANY OCCASION FOR IT IT COULD BE USED AS A RIDING-SCHOOL
AND MORE THAN THAT TOO IT SEEMS THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE COME SO FAR FOR I HEAR FOOTSTEPS AND THE SOUND OF VOICES AS HE SPOKE FOUQUET TURNED ROUND AND OPENED WITH HIS CANE A MASS OF FOLIAGE WHICH HID THE PATH FROM HIS VIEW
SHE HAD THEM FROM MESSIEURS DE GUISE
DE GUICHE'S WARDROBE
MY HUSBAND IS JEALOUS SHE MURMURED IN A TONE OF WHICH NOTHING COULD EQUAL ITS SWEETNESS AND CHARM
THE WHOLE COURT SUBDUED BY HER ENCHANTING GRACE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT LAUGHTER COULD BE INDULGED IN BEFORE THE GREATEST MONARCH IN THE WORLD LIKE PEOPLE WHO MERITED THEIR APPELLATION OF THE WITTIEST AND MOST POLISHED PEOPLE IN EUROPE
OUT YONDER ALL ARE AT THIS MOMENT SEATED AT TABLE AND FULLY OCCUPIED OR PREPARING TO ADORN THEMSELVES FOR A SET AND FORMAL PROMENADE
ANSWER ME AT LEAST AFTER HAVING SO CLOSELY QUESTIONED ME THE DUKE HAD SEATED HIMSELF WITH HIS HEAD BURIED IN HIS HANDS
DE WARDES IRRITATED BEYOND MEASURE LEFT THE PALAIS ROYAL AND HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS HOMEWARD TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE LODGED
IT WAS VIRGIL WHO OBSERVED OF AUGUSTUS
D'ARTAGNAN I BELIEVE AND ON ACCOUNT OF AN AFFAIR IN THE PLACE DE GREVE WHEN I HAD THE HONOR TO DRAW MY SWORD IN THE KING'S SERVICE
MADAME IS A COQUETTE THEN I FEAR SO MY POOR BROTHER SAID THE KING LAUGHING
BY WHAT HAPPY CHANCE DO I SEE YOU
LOUIS INQUIRED OF MONSIEUR THE PARTICULARS OF THE DAY'S BATHING
BUT THE LATTER PREFERRED TALKING WITH RAOUL EVEN IF IT WERE ONLY TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH HIS INNUMERABLE QUESTIONS AND HIS ASTONISHMENT
FOUQUET WHO THEREUPON ENTERED THE KING'S APARTMENT
WHEN ONE RUNS AWAY IT IS EITHER FROM GUILT OR FEAR SOMETIMES BECAUSE A MAN IS OFFENDED
YOU WILL FIND HIM WALKING ABOUT ON THE SIDE OF THE CHATEAU WHERE HER APARTMENTS ARE STAY MY DEAR MALICORNE YOU WERE NOT MISTAKEN FOR HERE HE IS COMING WHY SHOULD I BE MISTAKEN
I FORGOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT SIRE THEY WERE SENT AT THE HOUR PROMISED WELL WELL SIRE THE COLORED LAMPS THE FIREWORKS THE MUSICIANS AND THE COOKS HAVE SWALLOWED UP FOUR MILLIONS IN EIGHT DAYS ENTIRELY TO THE LAST PENNY
THE TWO SHEPHERDS PURSUED MY NYMPH STILL LAUGHING FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF THE THREE YOUNG LADIES,'--NO I MEAN OF THE THREE NYMPHS
I DON'T SAY THERE ARE NOT TOADS IN THE DUNGEONS REPLIED BAISEMEAUX
MADAME DE BELLIERE'S PLATE
ALL THE FASCINATIONS OF AN ELOQUENT FRIENDSHIP WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERSUADE HIM AND SHOULD THIS BE INSUFFICIENT THE MADDENING INFLUENCE OF A DEVOTED PASSION WHICH IN ITS RESOLUTE DETERMINATION TO CARRY CONVICTION WOULD NOT BE TURNED ASIDE
BUT A GESTURE OF THE FRANCISCAN ACCOMPANIED BY A CRY FOR HIM TO REMAIN RESTRAINED HIM
I FONDLY THOUGHT YOU CONSENTED TO ALL THE PLANS WE HAD TOGETHER LAID DOWN FOR OUR OWN HAPPINESS AT THE TIME WHEN WE WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE WALKS OF COUR-CHEVERNY UNDER THE AVENUE OF POPLAR TREES LEADING TO BLOIS
AND THEN BY DEGREES THE MORNING VISIT HAD BEEN SUPPRESSED ALTOGETHER
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SHALL BE A MAID OF HONOR IS THAT TRUE QUITE TRUE I MAY THEN HOPE TO GO TO PARIS DEPEND ON IT OH
AMYNTAS FOR INSTANCE I PITY THEM WITH ALL MY SOUL REPLIED DE GUICHE
THE KING FELT EMBARRASSED FOR HIS CONFIDANT WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY ABOUT TO EMBARK IN A DIFFICULT MATTER
ARE YOU GOING TO ENGLAND TO REMAIN THERE PERMANENTLY
TWO OF THE OUTRIDERS PRECEDED HER MAJESTY WITH LONG POLES WHICH THEY USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PUTTING THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES ASIDE OR REMOVING THE BUSHES THAT MIGHT IMPEDE HER PROGRESS
I ASSURE YOU SAID THE DUKE THAT IF YOU KILL ME YOU WILL BE RENDERING ME AN INFINITE SERVICE I WILL DO MY UTMOST TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE TO YOU DUKE SAID DE WARDES
WHAT IS HE DOING THERE THOUGH HE IS WAITING UNTIL THE LITTLE DOOR OF THE STAIRCASE BELONGING TO THE LADIES OF HONOR IS OPENED
IF WE ARE MENACED WE HAVE MEANS OF DEFENSE OH
DURING THIS TIME THE KING HAD FOUND MADAME BENEATH A TREE WITH OVERHANGING BRANCHES AND HAD SEATED HIMSELF BY HER SIDE
YOUR FATHER I HAVE HEARD CARRIED MATTERS WITH A HIGH HAND
YOUR MAJESTY IS RIGHT
DE BRAGELONNE SAID THE KING
IF THERE BE USURY IT IS I WHO PRACTICE IT AND BOTH OF US REAP THE ADVANTAGE FROM IT--THAT IS ALL SOME INTRIGUE D'HERBLAY I DO NOT DENY IT AND BAISEMEAUX AN ACCOMPLICE IN IT WHY NOT?--THERE ARE WORSE ACCOMPLICES THAN HE
BUT HOW DID YOU PROCURE THE DETAILS BY THE AID OF WHICH YOU HAVE CONSTRUCTED YOUR PLAN I HAVE THE UNDER-SERVANTS OF THE KING OF FRANCE IN MY PAY AND I OBTAIN FROM THEM ALL THE WASTE PAPERS WHICH HAVE BEEN SAVED FROM BEING BURNT VERY INGENIOUS MURMURED THE FRANCISCAN ENDEAVORING TO SMILE
DE WARDES WAS COLD AND IMPENETRABLE
THINK ONLY OF ONE THING THAT IF THE KING SHOULD BECOME UNWELL I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SUMMON HIS PHYSICIAN
IN MANY HEARTS OF LOVE
NAY DO NOT DENY IT
SHE HAS SOME MONEY OF HER OWN AND NOT A LITTLE EITHER FOR SHE GETS MONEY FROM HER BROTHER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE AT THE SAME TIME
ONLY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DO NOT GET FISH OR POULTRY NOR RICH WINES AT EVERY MEAL
VANNES HE SAID
DE WARDES HAD THAT KEEN AND MERCILESS PENETRATION MOST EVIL NATURES POSSESS
BUT TELL ME WHAT OTHERS SAY OF HER THEY SAY SHE IS WELL CONDUCTED OH SAID THE KING SMILING THAT IS MERE REPORT BUT RARE ENOUGH AT COURT SIRE TO BELIEVE WHEN IT IS SPREAD PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT
REALLY IT IS MOST FORTUNATE
DURING THE DAY I MAY SET OUT FOR BLOIS UNLESS I HAVE ORDERS TO THE CONTRARY I SHALL PRESENT MY RESPECTS TO YOU TO-MORROW MONSIEUR AS SOON AS ATHOS HAD LEFT RAOUL OPENED BUCKINGHAM'S LETTER
FOUQUET AND COULD HAVE REMAINED AT THE CHATEAU WITH M
THE QUEENS STATELY AND CEREMONIOUS WERE SOFTENED AND COULD NOT RESTRAIN THEIR LAUGHTER
THE FIRE WAS LAID CANDLES IN THE CANDELABRA REFRESHMENTS UPON THE TABLE BOOKS SCATTERED ABOUT FRESH-CUT FLOWERS IN THE VASES
AND MADAME--OH MADAME THE YOUNG GIRL EXCLAIMED WITH AN EXPRESSION ALMOST RESEMBLING TERROR
OH I KNOW HER BETTER THAN YOU DO THEN EXCLAIMED GUICHE
HE PROCURED THE SIGNATURE
PLEASE TO LEARN MADAME THAT I AM NOT A GIRL TO SERVE EITHER BOURGEOISES OR ROBINES
SHE TOUCHED THE SPRING AND DREW OUT THE HANDLE OF THE BELL
I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE YOU MADAME AMYNTAS IS OF TOO HUMBLE A POSITION PARTICULARLY BESIDE TYRCIS FOR HIS PERSON TO BE HONORED BY A PARALLEL
AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE CABIN HOW PROFOUND WAS HIS UNHAPPINESS TO SEE HIMSELF BANISHED BY ETIQUETTE FROM THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOVEREIGN TO A POSITION INFERIOR TO THAT WHICH BY RANK HE WAS ENTITLED TO
BUT IN ALL PROBABILITY I NEVER SHALL WHY NOT BECAUSE IF I WERE EVEN TO PUT MY FOOT INSIDE ONE OF THOSE HORRIBLE DUNGEONS I SHOULD FANCY I WAS BURIED THERE FOREVER NO NO
HOW LISTEN MADAME HELD HER BREATH
D'ARTAGNAN CERTAINLY NOT
BUT FORGIVE ME SIRE
WELL SAID THE LATTER IT IS TRUE THAT I OBTAINED ADMISSION FOR HER IN MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD AH SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
DID THEY LAY DOWN ANY CONDITIONS THAT OF CHOICE SIMPLY SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
ALREADY EVEN THROUGH THE GOODNESS OF HEAVEN I HAVE MET WITH YOU
WHAT FOR TO GO THE ROUND OF THE BASTILE WHY YOU WILL THEN SEE FOR YOURSELF--SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES BUT THE REGULATIONS NEVER MIND THEM
WHY HAVE WE SLEPT CLOSE TO HER APARTMENT INSTEAD OF SLEEPING AS USUAL IN OUR OWN
I ENTREAT YOU THEREFORE TO SAY FRANKLY WHAT YOU THINK OF THESE BRACELETS THAT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SIRE AND CANNOT BE OFFERED TO ANY OTHER THAN A QUEEN I AM DELIGHTED THAT SUCH IS YOUR OPINION MADEMOISELLE
AND YET HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY DID NOT USE THIS LANGUAGE SOME TIME AGO WHEN THE NEWS ABOUT BELLE-ISLE ARRIVED FOR INSTANCE YOU ARE RIGHT M
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT IN ORDER TO VISIT THIS NEW DIVINITY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT PAYING A VISIT TO MY APARTMENTS AND THAT AS PROPRIETY WILL FORBID YOUR CONVERSING WITH HER IN PRIVATE YOU WILL BE COMPELLED TO SEE HER IN MY CIRCLE TO SPEAK AS IT WERE AT ME WHILE SPEAKING TO HER
I WOULD ONLY REPEAT MONSIEUR THAT WE ARE QUITE ALONE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID RAOUL AND OFFERING HER HIS HAND HE LED THE YOUNG GIRL INTO THE GALLERY ADJOINING THE RECEPTION-ROOM THE WINDOWS OF WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON THE COURTYARD
FOUQUET AND CONFERRED ON M
MONSIEUR LOVES HIMSELF TOO MUCH
WELL SAINT-AIGNAN HE INQUIRED WITH AFFECTED INTEREST HOW IS THE INVALID REALLY SIRE STAMMERED SAINT-AIGNAN TO MY SHAME I CONFESS I DO NOT KNOW WHAT
YOUR FRIEND DE GUICHE HAS BEEN ADMIRABLY RECEIVED BAH THE KING MADE QUITE A FUSS OVER HIM THE KING WHO EXILED HIM MADAME SMILED UPON HIM AND MONSIEUR APPEARS TO LIKE HIM BETTER THAN EVER AH
SIRE IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR A MAN TO LOVE A WOMAN AND SHE SMILED SO TENDERLY AND WITH SO MUCH ARCHNESS THAT THE KING FELT HIS HEART SWELL AND THROB IN HIS BREAST
SHE DARTED A TERRIBLE LOOK AT SAINT-AIGNAN AND FLED
DE GUICHE WHO IS IN LOVE WITH MADAME
HE KICKED OVER A CHIFFONIER WHICH TUMBLED ON THE CARPET BROKEN INTO PIECES
DE GUICHE AFTER HAVING SPENT THE MORNING IN SELECTING EMBROIDERIES AND FRINGES WITH MADAME WENT TO CONSOLE THE PRINCE
THERE BREATHLESS LEANING AGAINST EACH OTHER FEELING THEIR HEARTS THROB WILDLY THEY ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES BUT COULD ONLY SUCCEED IN DOING SO AFTER THE LAPSE OF SOME MINUTES
THE KEYS OF THE PRINCIPAL MANSION WERE HANDED OVER TO THEM SO THAT THEY MADE UP HUNTING-PARTIES AND WALKING EXCURSIONS WITH SUCH LADIES AS ARE TO BE FOUND IN BELLE-ISLE
NOT BEFORE I HAVE PRESENT MONSIEUR BAISEMEAUX DE MONTLEZUN THE GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE BAISEMEAUX AND ATHOS SALUTED EACH OTHER
BUT ALAS
SO PRAY CONTINUE M
AFTER HAVING SAID TOO LITTLE YOU NOW SAY TOO MUCH
YOURS IS SO TOO MARGUERITE AND YET I DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT YOU ALLOWED YOURSELF TO BE OVERCOME BY GRIEF WHEN YOUR HEART WAS WOUNDED THESE WORDS WERE IN DIRECT ALLUSION TO MARGUERITE'S RUPTURE WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND WERE ALSO A VEILED BUT DIRECT REPROACH MADE AGAINST HER FRIEND'S HEART
DE WARDES HIS SMILE IMMEDIATELY FADED AWAY AND HIS GLACE BECAME COLD AND SHARP AS A SWORD
COME WITH ME
AND I ENTREAT YOU TO GIVE ME THE SAME KIND ATTENTION THAT HAS NEVER YET FAILED ME SPEAK RAOUL I PRESENT THE CASE TO YOU MONSIEUR FREE FROM ALL PREFACE FOR THAT WOULD BE UNWORTHY OF YOU
LET US GET INTO THE HOUSE IN SOME WAY OR OTHER FOR THAT IS A TACTIC WHICH CANNOT IN ANY CASE BE UNFAVORABLE TO YOUR LOVE AFFAIR AH
HE COULD NOT BE FOUND IN HIS APARTMENTS BAH
BESIDES IT WILL BE AN EASY MATTER TO DO SO SAID THE KING CHECKING A SIGH
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPUGNANT TO MY FEELINGS TO HAVE FOUND ONE OF OUR ORDER OF LITTLE STANDING IN HIS PROFESSION
IMPOSSIBLE MONSIEUR IMPOSSIBLE IN THAT CASE LET ME ASSIST MALICORNE TO GET DOWN
ARE YOU NOT WELL NO SIRE I WILL SUMMON YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANTS THEN NO FOR THEY CAN DO NOTHING FOR MY INDISPOSITION YOU ALARM ME SIRE I WISH TO ASK YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION TO RETURN TO ENGLAND THE KING STARTED
LOVE APART MALICORNE WAS HAPPY
HE THEN SUMMONED HIS TAILORS INSPECTED HIS COSTUMES FOR THE NEXT DAY AND IN TOKEN OF HIS EXTREME SATISFACTION DISTRIBUTED VARIOUS PRESENTS AMONG THEM
HE SMILED WITH AN ENORMOUS BUT WELL-FURNISHED MOUTH AND HIS POINTED CHIN WHICH APPEARED TO ENJOY A MOBILITY NATURE DOES NOT ORDINARILY GRANT TO THAT PORTION OF THE COUNTENANCE LEANT FROM TIME TO TIME VERY LOVINGLY TOWARDS HIS INTERLOCUTRIX WHO WE MUST SAY DID NOT ALWAYS DRAW BACK SO RAPIDLY AS STRICT PROPRIETY HAD A RIGHT TO REQUIRE
THIS SECRET BURNS LIKE VITRIOL BUT YOU SURVIVE NO ONE IS AWARE THAT I KNOW IT AND FOR WHAT LENGTH OF TIME HAVE YOU POSSESSED THIS SECRET FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND YOU HAVE KEPT IT I WISHED TO LIVE AND YOU GIVE IT TO THE ORDER WITHOUT AMBITION WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I GIVE IT TO THE ORDER WITH AMBITION AND WITH A HOPE OF RETURN SAID ARAMIS
IT FOLLOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE LATTER RECOMMENDATION WAS QUITE AS UNNECESSARY AS THE FORMER
HE SEEMED TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT OF THE INSOLENCE AND LICENSE OF THE TWO SPEAKERS IN ORDER TO SETTLE MATTERS WITH THEM AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY
YOU MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
OH SAID COLBERT MALICIOUSLY YOU ARE TREATING US WITH INDULGENCE
BUT STILL MY DEAR BISHOP I BELIEVE YOU ARE EXAGGERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AFFAIR BLIND HOW BLIND YOU ARE MURMURED ARAMIS
EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO HIM YOURSELF SHE HAD HARDLY FINISHED WHEN PHILIP HEARD THE DOOR OF THE ANTE-ROOM OPEN WITH SOME NOISE
IN FACT SAID THE DUKE YIELDING TO THE MELANCHOLY INFLUENCE OF THIS OPENING CONVERSATION SENSITIVE PERSONS LIVE AS MUCH IN THE PAST OR THE FUTURE AS IN THE PRESENT THAT IS VERY TRUE SAID THE QUEEN IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
HE WAS DELIGHTED AT HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMING TO A CONCLUSION WITH MADAME DE SAINT-REMY AND HE TURNED ROUND WHAT IS THE QUESTION MADEMOISELLE COME HITHER MALICORNE SAID MONTALAIS WITH AN IMPERIOUS GESTURE
ONLY TELL HIS MAJESTY YOU THANK HIM RAOUL BOWED SO GRACEFULLY THAT LOUIS TO WHOM ALL SUPERIOR QUALITIES WERE PLEASING WHEN THEY DID NOT OVERSHADOW HIS OWN ADMIRED HIS BEAUTY STRENGTH AND MODESTY
COME COME DESCEND AGAIN TO THE EARTH TRAVELER IN THE SEVENTH HEAVEN SAID ARAMIS
SO THAT AT THE SIGHT OF GUICHE WHO ADVANCED TO MEET HIM AT A HAND GALLOP MOUNTED UPON A MAGNIFICENT WHITE HORSE THE PRINCE COULD NOT RESTRAIN AN EXCLAMATION OF DELIGHT
IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THE MARQUISE RECOVERED HERSELF
IF ON THE CONTRARY SHE HAD REMAINED PASSIVE IN THE WHOLE AFFAIR WHAT GROUNDS HAD THE KING TO BE ANGRY WITH HER ON THAT ACCOUNT
I HAVE ONLY BEEN THERE ONCE REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN WITH READINESS AND GOOD-HUMOR
IT WAS BUCKINGHAM WHO HAD AWAKENED FROM HIS STUPOR IN ORDER TO ADORN HIMSELF WITH A COSTUME PERFECTLY DAZZLING FROM ITS BEAUTY AND TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS AND THE QUEEN-MOTHER AT THE HOTEL DE VILLE
NOW SAID ARAMIS YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME IF I WERE TO CARRY OFF ONE OF YOUR PRISONERS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY OBTAINING HIS PARDON OF COURSE
UNSOCIABLE FROM NATURAL DISPOSITION HE HAD ESTRANGED HIMSELF TOO MUCH PREVIOUS TO THE ARRIVAL OF MADAME BUT AFTER HER ARRIVAL HE DID NOT ESTRANGE HIMSELF SUFFICIENTLY
IT IS REALLY A GOOD ROOM VERY NICELY FURNISHED AND CARPETED
BUT TO BE ABLE TO SELL THIS SUIT THE LAST HE HAD LEFT,--AS WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONFESS TO THE READER--MANICAMP HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE TO HIS BED
WELL WELL I OWE M
YOU HAD THE HONOR LAST NIGHT AND YOU HAVE IT STILL TO-DAY OF OCCUPYING THE WHOLE COURT MY DEAR LOUISE
FAUCHEUX THE AMOUNT IS ENTERED IN MY BOOKS
MANICAMP SHOW US THE WAY TO THE HOUSE DESTINED FOR HER ROYAL HIGHNESS'S RESIDENCE WITHOUT IN ANY WAY DIVINING THE COUNT'S PROJECT HIS FRIENDS FOLLOWED HIM ACCOMPANIED BY A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHOSE ACCLAMATIONS AND DELIGHT SEEMED A HAPPY OMEN FOR THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROJECT WITH WHICH THEY WERE YET UNACQUAINTED
I SHOULD FIND NOTHING BUT SPIDERS RATS AND PERHAPS TOADS TOO TOADS CRIED BAISEMEAUX
BEFORE HER WAS STILL BURNING THE ROSE-COLORED TAPER SHE HAD USED TO SEAL IT
FOUQUET FOR I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT YOU HAVE NOT LEFT YOUR ROOMS AT SAINT-MANDE DURING THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE YOUR MAJESTY THAT I HAVE KEPT MYSELF SHUT UP FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS REPLIED FOUQUET
DE WARDES
DE WARDES
DE WARDES
I AM DYING
MALICORNE OBEYED
AND THEN BESIDES IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF DANGER OR OF PASSION
THAT WOULD BE QUITE ANOTHER THING
D'ARTAGNAN SIRE THIS WORD WAS PRONOUNCED TO ME BY A PIQUEUR WHO WORE CRAPE ON HIS ARM MY UNCLE GASTON OF ORLEANS PERHAPS SIRE HE HAS RENDERED HIS LAST SIGH AND I WAS NOT WARNED OF IT CRIED THE KING WHOSE ROYAL SUSCEPTIBILITY SAW AN INSULT IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS INTELLIGENCE
HAVE YOU NOT OBSERVED IT YOU WHO WERE FORMERLY SO KEEN-SIGHTED ARE YOU JEALOUS OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TO THE VERY DEATH AGAIN JEALOUS THIS TIME THE AFFAIR WILL BE EASY TO ARRANGE BETWEEN US
IT WAS BY NO MEANS FLATTERING FOR HIM TO MARRY A PRINCESS OF WHOM WHEN YOUNG THE KING HAD NOT THOUGHT MUCH
AND THEY COULD NOT DEFEND THEMSELVES THE KING PRESERVED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
SHE RECOVERED HERSELF HOWEVER AND SAID I WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT IN SAYING YOU WERE A WITTY WOMAN FOR YOU ARE MAKING THE TIME PASS AWAY MOST AGREEABLY
ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH A YOUNG GIRL OF THE NAME OF LA VALLIERE
FOUQUET IS WHY WHAT CONNECTION CAN THERE BE HOW STUPID YOU ARE
BUT WHO CAN IT POSSIBLY BE
IT IS MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE WHISPERED THE LATTER TO LA VALLIERE
ATHOS FIXED UPON BRAGELONNE A SEARCHING LOOK OVERSHADOWED INDEED BY A SLIGHT SADNESS
BUCKINGHAM REGARDED HER AS A COQUETTE DESERVING THE CRUELEST TORTURES AND DE GUICHE LOOKED UPON HER AS A DIVINITY
BUT SHE RETURNED A MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT SHE COULD NOT BE PRESENT BUT WOULD DINE IN HER OWN APARTMENT
WELL CONTINUED THE PRINCESS AS MY NAIAD WHO IN HER CHARACTER OF A GODDESS HAD AT FIRST SPOKEN TO ME IN ENGLISH I FEARED AS YOU SUGGEST THAT I MIGHT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD HER AND I REQUESTED MESDEMOISELLES DE MONTALAIS DE TONNAY-CHARENTE AND DE LA VALLIERE TO COME TO ME BEGGING MY NAIAD TO REPEAT TO ME IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE THE RECITAL SHE HAD ALREADY COMMUNICATED TO ME IN ENGLISH AND DID SHE DO SO INQUIRED THE KING
NOW LET US CONSIDER
DIE POOR TENDER LITTLE DARLING REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
AND NOW LISTEN ATTENTIVELY TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY M
I AM NOT WITHOUT COURAGE AND NOT ALTOGETHER DEFICIENT IN ABILITY
NEVER EVEN THE SHADOW OF LIBERTY
YOU HAVE STATED THAT YOU REGARD ME AS YOUR MORTAL ENEMY BECAUSE I WAS SO YOU AFFIRM THAT OF YOUR FATHER PERFECTLY TRUE MONSIEUR I HAVE SAID SO REPLIED DE WARDES WHOSE PALLID FACE BECAME SLIGHTLY TINGED WITH COLOR
MADAME LOOKED AT DE GUICHE LIGHTLY BUT LIGHT AS HER LOOK HAD BEEN IT BROUGHT A DELIGHTFUL COLOR TO HIS FACE
THE GUITAR PLAYER THRUST HIS INSTRUMENT UNDER A TABLE COVERING IT WITH A PIECE OF CARPET TO CONCEAL IT FROM THE PRINCE'S OBSERVATION
LOUIS EYES AS BEAUTIFUL BUT BLUE
THE BUST OF THE FIGURE WAS IN HARMONIOUS KEEPING WITH THE BASE
NO NO RETURNED LA VALLIERE
BUT WHEN IT WAS OBSERVED THAT EVEN INSIDE THE HARBOR THE BOATS WERE TOSSED TO AND FRO AND THAT BEYOND THE JETTY THE WAVES ROSE MOUNTAINS HIGH DASHING UPON THE SHORE WITH A TERRIBLE UPROAR IT WAS READILY BELIEVED THAT NOT ONE OF THOSE FRAIL BOATS WOULD BE ABLE WITH SAFETY TO REACH A FOURTH PART OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SHORE AND THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
FOR I NO LONGER REMEMBER TO WHOM I INTENDED TO REFER
TO EXPECT ANYTHING GOOD FROM THEM IS TO REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES THE KING WHO HAD THE GREATEST CONSIDERATION FOR HIMSELF AND WHO HAD BEGUN TO ACQUIRE OVER HIS EMOTIONS THAT COMMAND WHICH HE PRESERVED OVER THEM ALL HIS LIFE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AN OUTRAGE TO HIS OWN DIGNITY IN DISPLAYING SO MUCH ANIMOSITY ABOUT SO TRIFLING AN OBJECT
BUT WHEN HIS EYES FELL UPON ARAMIS WHO REMAINED IN THE BACKGROUND THE LATTER TREMBLED TURNED PALE AND HIS HAT WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND FELL UPON THE GROUND AS IF ALL HIS MUSCLES HAD BECOME RELAXED AT ONCE
THERE MUST SURELY BE DRYADS AT FONTAINEBLEAU THEN SAID MADAME IN A PERFECTLY CALM VOICE
A MERE NOTHING
IF WE'VE CALCULATED CORRECTLY THAT FOURTH TEXT SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE MODERN EDITIONS OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK WHICH IS STILL WIDELY CIRCULATED AND COMPRISES ABOUT THE LAST 1/4 OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE
WAS IT NOT YOU WHO SPOKE TO ME ABOUT A CERTAIN YOUNG MAN YES A POOR DEVIL OF A STUDENT WHO MADE--WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT WHERE TWO LATIN VERSES RHYME TOGETHER A DISTICH YES
YOU ARE WELL KNOWN COMTE
MONTALAIS WHO DURING THEIR PROGRESS HAD DISCHARGED THE FUNCTIONS OF A CLEVER SCOUT ADVANCED A FEW STEPS FURTHER AND TURNING ROUND AGAIN TO BE QUITE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS EITHER LISTENING OR APPROACHING SAID TO HER COMPANION THANK GOODNESS WE ARE QUITE ALONE
AS FOR BAISEMEAUX NOTICING THE LITTLE EFFECT PRODUCED BY HIS ADVICE AND HIS PORT WINE HE LEFT THE DUNGEON QUITE UPSET
HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TOWARDS ME KIND
I HAVE THE PLAN OF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF BELLE-ISLE SAID THE KING
RAOUL NOTED ONLY THE TEARS LOUISE SHED
YES MADAME AND THROUGH THE PROTECTION OF M
AND THEN WE CAN GO AND TELL OTHERS HOW CREDULOUS THE KING IS AND CAN ENJOY A LAUGH AT HIS EXPENSE OH EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE YOU THINK THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT!--IT IS FRIGHTFUL AND PURSUED THE KING THAT IS NOT ALL
AS FOR THE BALLET ITSELF EVERY PERSON KNEW THE PART HE HAD TO TAKE IN IT AND HOW TO PERFORM IT
YOU ARE UNWORTHY PRINCESS OF THE ROYAL BLOOD THOUGH YOU MAY BE OF THE LOVE OF A MAN OF HONOR
ONLY IN THE CHAPTER OF CHARGES MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS COST PER ANNUM_:--RIBBONS GLOVES AND SWEETS A THOUSAND LIVRES
SIRE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE HURRIED AWAY BY THE VIOLENCE OF HER EMOTIONS WERE I TO DIE OF SHAME ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE MY KNEES ARE FIXED I WOULD REPEAT IT UNTIL MY LATEST BREATH
AND YOU SPOKE MAGNIFICENTLY HE SAID IN A HALF-CHOKED VOICE
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE SAID MADAME DE NAVAILLES TO MONSIEUR WHO AS HE SALUTED HIS WIFE REPEATED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE AH
WHAT POSSIBLE INTEREST CAN ARAMIS HAVE IN OBLIGING BAISEMEAUX IN THIS MANNER
YOU ARE SETTING OFF THEN BRAGELONNE APPROACHED THE GROUP OF YOUNG MEN AND SALUTED THEM WITH THAT QUIET AND SERIOUS MANNER PECULIAR TO HIM
A SUPERVISION OF SOME SORT OR ANOTHER FOR INSTANCE THAT HAPPENS VERY FORTUNATELY FOR YESTERDAY I DISMISSED MY CHIEF USHER OF THE APARTMENTS THAT WILL DO ADMIRABLY
SHAME
TO BE THE MASTER OF ARMIES OF PRISONS OF AN ALMOST DIVINE AUTHORITY AND TO EXERT SUCH MAJESTY AND MIGHT IN THE SERVICE OF A PETTY GRUDGE WOULD BE UNWORTHY NOT ONLY OF A MONARCH BUT EVEN OF A MAN
I KNOW THE MAN AND NOW LET ME SEE WHO THE WOMAN IS SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WATCHING THE ROUNDS OF THE LADDER ON WHICH WERE STANDING TWO PRETTY LITTLE FEET COVERED WITH BLUE SATIN SHOES
YOUR CONDESCENSION CANNOT BE REPAID FAREWELL M
BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS RATHER STARTLING
HE PICKED IT UP AND BURNT IT TO THE LAST ATOM
CHAPTER XXVIII
FOR MYSELF I CARE LITTLE FOR MONEY FOR SUPERFLUITY YOU MEAN
AND WHAT IS MORE YOU WILL NOT SLAY HIM FOR HE IS ARMED ON ALL SIDES,--HE IS A HUSBAND A JEALOUS MAN,--HE IS THE SECOND GENTLEMAN IN FRANCE,--HE IS MY SON THE DUC DU ORLEANS THE DUKE TURNED PALE AS DEATH
THEN CONTINUED THE MARQUISE YOU ARE QUITE ENAMORED OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM--I MEAN OF M
AND AN IMMENSE DISTANCE IF IT BE LEAGUES ON THE SEA
BUT MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE INTERRUPTED DE WARDES WITH A KIND OF OBSTINACY I AFFIRM THAT IT IS I WHO AM CORRECT WHAT WAS YOUR OPINION MONSIEUR I WAS SAYING THAT EVERYTHING IS DONE IN FRANCE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TO HUMILIATE MEN OF FAMILY AND BY WHOM BY THE KING HIMSELF
IT WAS ONLY THIS MORNING THAT I HEARD OF THE ACCIDENT THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DID YOU SEE HER BEFORE YOU CAME TO ME I HAD THE HONOR OF TAKING LEAVE OF HER AND YOU SAY RESUMED MADAME MAKING A POWERFUL EFFORT OVER HERSELF THAT THE KING HAS--DEFERRED YOUR MARRIAGE WITH THIS YOUNG GIRL YES MADAME DEFERRED IT DID HE ASSIGN ANY REASON FOR THIS POSTPONEMENT NONE HOW LONG IS IT SINCE THE COMTE DE LA FERE PREFERRED HIS REQUEST TO THE KING MORE THAN A MONTH MADAME IT IS VERY SINGULAR SAID THE PRINCESS AS SOMETHING LIKE A FILM CLOUDED HER EYES
DE GUICHE I AM A COQUETTE AN A WORTHLESS CREATURE WORTHLESS CRIED THE YOUNG MAN
I TOO WELL KNOW WHAT ANY HOUSEHOLD COMES TO THAT IS TROUBLED BY ADVISERS YOU SHALL BE OBEYED MADAME AND YOU WILL BE SATISFIED AT THE RESULT
MADAME SAID THE COMTE TREMBLING AND BEWILDERED
THE FACT OF HAVING INSPIRED A PASSION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL WILL HENCEFORTH CONFER A TITLE TO BEAUTY ON THIS SIR REPLIED DE BRAGELONNE I DO NOT LIKE TO HEAR SUCH MATTERS TREATED SO LIGHTLY
NO I KNOW SAID THE KING YOU MEAN YOUR ENTERPRISE OF THE GREVE
I HAVE PASSED THE NIGHT WRITING AND ALL MY ORDERS ARE GIVEN DO NOT CONCEAL IT FROM YOURSELF D'HERBLAY BUT THE FETE WILL COST SOME MILLIONS I WILL SUPPLY SIX
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE TOLD ME SO IN THAT CASE SHE PROBABLY TOLD YOU THE CAUSE OF MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S FAINTING WHY YES
COME LOUISE LET US TAKE COUNSEL YOU AND I TOGETHER IN ORDER THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO LA VALLIERE LIFTED TOWARDS HER COMPANION HER BEAUTIFUL EYES PURE AND DEEP AS THE AZURE OF A SPRING SKY AND I SHE SAID WILL ASK YOU WHY WE HAVE BEEN SUMMONED TO MADAME'S OWN ROOM
BUT LET US RESUME OUR OWN AFFAIR
MANICAMP WENT AWAY A FEW PACES BUT RETURNING TO THE FOOT OF THE LADDER HE SAID BY THE BY HOW DO I GET TO M
I AM NOW EXPECTING HIS MAJESTY
IF IT WERE REALLY THE CASE EXCLAIMED LOUIS VIOLENTLY
THE BUTTERFLY-CHASE
HE PUSHED THROUGH THE CROWD WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM BUCKINGHAM AND FOLLOWED BY RAOUL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE OF ACTION FROM ONE SIDE JUST AS DE WARDES CAME UP FROM THE OTHER
AT FIFTEEN I WAS MYSELF VERY THIN
I AM SURE OF IT VERY WELL I REMAIN IN MY TREE THEN ALTHOUGH I CANNOT BE WORSE PLACED MONSIEUR MANICAMP WE ARE WANDERING AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT YOU ARE RIGHT WE ARE SO YOU WROTE ME A LETTER I DID WHY DID YOU WRITE FANCY AT TWO O'CLOCK TO-DAY DE GUICHE LEFT WHAT THEN SEEING HIM SET OFF I FOLLOWED HIM AS I USUALLY DO OF COURSE I SEE THAT SINCE YOU ARE HERE NOW DON'T BE IN A HURRY
BUT SAID ARAMIS LOOKING WITH FIXED ATTENTION AT THE RUBY-COLORED WINE HE HAD RAISED TO THE LEVEL OF HIS EYES AS IF HE WISHED TO ENJOY IT WITH ALL HIS SENSES AT THE SAME MOMENT BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A RESEMBLANCE ANOTHER WOULD NOT PERHAPS TAKE ANY NOTICE OF MOST CERTAINLY HE WOULD THOUGH IF IT WERE ANY ONE WHO KNEW THE PERSON HE RESEMBLES I REALLY THINK DEAR M
AND AT MADAME'S SOIREES NO ONE FAILED TO BE PRESENT
I REPEAT THEREFORE FOR THE SECOND TIME BE CAREFUL CAREFUL OF WHAT MAY I ASK
YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR OPINION FOR I ONLY BOUGHT THEM ON CONDITION THAT YOU RATIFIED THE PURCHASE
AS FOR YOU COUNT PURSUE YOUR INQUIRIES AND BE HERE TO-MORROW THE KING PLACED HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS
FOUQUET RUSHES TO THE KING AND GIVES HIM BELLE-ISLE AS A PRESENT THUS ALLAYING ANY SUSPICION AND AT THE SAME TIME HUMILIATING COLBERT JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE USHER ANNOUNCES SOMEONE ELSE SEEKING AN AUDIENCE WITH THE KING
OTHER WOMEN--MONTALAIS FOR INSTANCE--HAVE ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE INFLUENCED BY FLATTERY
BRAGELONNE QUITTED THE TENT WITH THE SLOW AND MEASURED STEP OF A MAN CURIOUS TO OBSERVE BUT ANXIOUS NOT TO BE SEEN
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY ONE TO BE COMPARED TO THE KING YOU WERE RIGHT JUST NOW IN SAYING YOU HAD EXCELLENT EYES LOUISE FOR YOU SEE A GREAT DISTANCE
BUT OF YOURSELF
COLBERT SMILED TOO
MADAME WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME ALL HER LIFE AND AS A MOTHER-IN-LAW I OUGHT TO DESIRE TO LIVE ON GOOD TERMS WITH MY NEW-FOUND DAUGHTER THE KING MADAME WILL TAKE ALL UPON HIMSELF
WHENEVER I PLACE MY COACHMAN AND MY CARRIAGE IN ANY PARTICULAR SPOT NOTHING BUT AN EXPRESS ORDER FROM THE KING COULD STIR THEM
KEEP FOR ME THEN A SMALL ROOM FOR A FRIEND WHO WILL ARRIVE EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER ME AND YOU ARE THE FRIEND I SUPPOSE SAID THE LANDLORD INTERRUPTING HIS READING OF THE LETTER
YOUR ABSENCE HAS OCCASIONED GREAT SURPRISE AND I HEARD MONSIEUR EXPRESS HIMSELF AS MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HAVING BEEN INVITED BY THE KING YOU HAD NOT COME IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO SO
HE ADDED ALSO THAT FINDING HIMSELF IN SUCH EXCELLENT COMPANY HE HAD NOT THE LEAST DESIRE TO HASTEN HIS EMBARKATION
BUT LOOK THERE INDEED IS A PRETTY FACE YES SAID RAOUL AND ONE I AM ACQUAINTED WITH MADEMOISELLE AURE DE MONTALAIS SAID MADAME DE NAVAILLES
THE QUEEN-MOTHER ROSE AND WITH A TONE OF AUTHORITY SAID PRAY SET OFF SIR THE YOUNG DUKE HESITATED LOOKED AROUND HIM AND WITH A LAST EFFORT HALF-CHOKED BY CONTENDING EMOTIONS SAID AND YOU GENTLEMEN M
DO YOU HOWEVER MEAN TO SAY THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN MUST SUFFER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR TERMINATION I DID NOT SAY HE WAS TO SUFFER MY LORD
GOOD DAY THE COMTE'S PATIENCE ALMOST FORSOOK HIM AS HE CONTINUED,--"YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS DANCED JUST NOW MOST CHARMINGLY DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
SUFFERING RESPONDED RAOUL PRESSING LOUISE'S HAND WITH A TENDER CURIOSITY
WHOEVER HAS SEEN AND HEARD TYRCIS MUST LOVE HIM
YOUR OWN YOU HAVE JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO CONFIDE TO ME
HIS WHOLE HEART SEEMED TO EXPAND AT THE GLOWING BREATH OF AN AFFECTION WHICH PROCLAIMED ITSELF IN SUCH NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS LANGUAGE
I WILL ASK MALICORNE WHO WILL FIND OUT FROM MLLE
HE HAD NO HOPES OF PREVAILING WITH WORDS FOR SHE SPOKE LOUDER THAN HE AND WITHOUT STOPPING
HE FORMED HIS WISHES HE DREW HIS INSPIRATIONS FROM MADAME'S EYES AND HIS DELIGHT WAS UNBOUNDED WHEN MADAME DEIGNED TO SMILE UPON HIM
THE DAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS DE LA VALLIERE THAT IS WELL ENOUGH
I DID NOT MISS ATTENDING MASS
THE KING IN HONOR OF HIS BROTHER HAD DIRECTED THAT THE FESTIVITIES SHOULD BE ON A SCALE OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE MAGNIFICENCE
THEN SUMMONING THE CONFESSOR AND THE PHYSICIAN HE SAID TO THE FORMER
MADAME ON HER SIDE DID NOT OPEN HER LIPS ABOUT IT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER TO HAVE REFUSED YOU ALTOGETHER CERTAINLY BUT HE WAS STRONGLY PERSUADED TO DO SO BY MY PROTECTOR WHO IS HE ONE OF YOUR OWN FRIENDS INDEED
AND NOW SIRE THAT I HAVE JUSTIFIED MYSELF AT LEAST I TRUST SO IN YOUR MAJESTY'S EYES GRANT ME LEAVE TO RETIRE INTO A CONVENT
FROM A LADY SAID HE FROM A LADY OF BLOIS YES MONSIEUR
I HAVE COME TO UNDECEIVE YOU MONSIEUR AND THE MORE COMPLETELY SO BECAUSE THERE IS ONE THING I CAN READ IN YOUR EYES WHAT IS THAT MADAME SAID FOUQUET ASTONISHED
LOUISE DID YOU COME TO PARIS BECAUSE I WAS NO LONGER AT BLOIS LA VALLIERE BLUSHED AND CONCEALED HER FACE IN HER HANDS
BUT HE DOES NOT DETECT HE DOES NOT SUSPECT THE REAL ENEMY
USURY IN A MATTER OF BENEVOLENCE DO NOT MIX YOURSELF UP WITH IT MONSEIGNEUR
AND MOANING IN UTTER DESPAIR SHE AGAIN FELL LIFELESS IN HER CHAIR
IN GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE DE GUICHE DEPEND ON ME INDEED I SHALL DO SO VERY WELL
A FEW MINUTES WILL SOON PASS AWAY
THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE TWO NEW PERSONAGES INTO THIS HISTORY AND THAT MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY OF NAMES AND SENTIMENTS MERIT SOME ATTENTION ON THE PART OF BOTH HISTORIAN AND READER
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT TO DEPICT THE SECRET PLAY OF THOSE STRANGE SYMPATHIES WHICH SUDDENLY AND APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY CAUSE ARE EXCITED AFTER MANY YEARS PASSED IN THE GREATEST CALMNESS AND INDIFFERENCE BY TWO HEARTS DESTINED TO LOVE EACH OTHER
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS RIGHT
D'ARTAGNAN SHALL I SHOW YOU HIS APARTMENTS SAID DE BRAGELONNE
SINCE IN REALITY HE HAS RESTORED HIM TO FAVOR I DID NOT NOTICE IT SAID THE PRINCE
AFTER MADAME HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF THE ENGLISH FLEET AND ONCE AGAIN HAD SALUTED THE COUNTRY IN SALUTING ITS FLAGS SHE ENTERED HER CARRIAGE SURROUNDED BY A BRILLIANT ESCORT
HE ACCORDINGLY WENT TO THE QUEEN'S PAVILION AND WAS ASTONISHED ON ENTERING TO FIND NONE OF THE ROYAL SERVANTS IN ATTENDANCE
MONSIEUR IS NOT A QUEEN
THE COURTIERS REMARKED HIS HEIGHTENED COLOR AND CONCLUDED THAT THE SCENE HAD BEEN A STORMY ONE
GOOD-EVENING SAID HE
IT MUST NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT LOUIS PROPOSED TO HIMSELF ANY PLAN OF SEDUCTION
ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD NEITHER BEAUTY NOR CHARMS ANY LONGER AT HER DISPOSAL
THE DEAD AT LEAST WERE FULL OF RESPECT AND SUBMISSION
LOUISE LEFT IN ORDER TO GET HER COSTUME PREPARED
AND SO A PLEASANT JOURNEY TO YOU RAOUL AND THE TWO FRIENDS TOOK A WARM LEAVE OF EACH OTHER
THE PRINCE THEN FLEW INTO THE WILDEST RAGE
INSTEAD HOWEVER OF SETTING OFF TO-DAY AS YOU WOULD DOUBTLESS WISH TO DO OR TO-MORROW AS OTHERS MAY HAVE EXPECTED LEAVE THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW IN THE EVENING
ALL THAT I CAN TELL YOU NOW IS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT I FELT SEVEN YEARS AGO TO HEAR YOU CONVERSE TO WITNESS YOUR RESIGNATION ONE MIGHT ALMOST BELIEVE THAT YOU LIKED YOUR IMPRISONMENT I ENDURE IT IN THE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERING YOUR FREEDOM SOME DAY I SUPPOSE I HAVE NO CERTAINTY
IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT ONE DAY ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON MONSIEUR WHO HAD RISEN LATE AND HAD BESTOWED UPON HIS TOILET MORE THAN HIS USUAL ATTENTION,--IT HAPPENED WE REPEAT THAT MONSIEUR WHO HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY PLANS HAVING BEEN ARRANGED FOR THE DAY FORMED THE PROJECT OF COLLECTING HIS OWN COURT AND OF CARRYING MADAME OFF WITH HIM TO MORET WHERE HE POSSESSED A CHARMING COUNTRY HOUSE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT WHICH THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCE PRODUCED UPON THIS GLEEFUL COMPANY AND IT WOULD BE EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT WHICH THE SIGHT OF THEIR HAPPINESS PRODUCED UPON PHILIP
THEIR TERROR WAS EXTREME WHEN THEY OBSERVED HOW THEIR MASTER BECAME COVERED WITH BLOOD IN PROPORTION TO THE WATER WITH WHICH IT WAS IMPREGNATED FLOWED TOWARDS HIS KNEES AND FEET
I HAVE RECEIVED A CERTAIN MESSAGE WRITTEN IN VERY GOOD FRENCH
THE PRINCESS IS NO DOUBT WEARIED ENOUGH
I WILL DO IT FOR DE BRAGELONNE THE KING AGAIN REMARKED THE COLDNESS WITH WHICH ATHOS RECEIVED THE REMARK
WE WILL GO AND INFORM MADAME THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE IS WEEPING FOR HER HUSBAND AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE ARE ALL WEEPING FOR A MASTER IN THIS OLD CASTLE OF BLOIS THE ABODE OF GRIEF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH FLIRTATIONS OH CRIED BOTH THE ACCUSED WITH ONE VOICE
HE THEREFORE SET OUT IN SEARCH OF HIM BUT DE GUICHE WHOM WE SAW DISAPPEAR BEHIND ONE OF THE WINGS AND WHO SEEMED TO HAVE RETURNED TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS HAD NOT ENTERED THE CHATEAU
A YOUNG MAN IS CONSCIOUS OF AND KNOWS THEM
D'ARTAGNAN'S PRINCIPLES PROFOUNDLY BUT I AM NOT BOUND TO APPLY THEM TO YOU
MY LORD SAID THE QUEEN PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT I AGREE IN EVERY PARTICULAR WITH THE DUKE OF NORFOLK
AND SO HER GLANCES HER SMILES HER TOILETTE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE ARMORY OF WEAPONS OF OFFENSE WERE SHOWERED ON THE THREE YOUNG MEN WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE
AND AFTER M
THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE PHYSICIAN AND OBSERVING HIS PALE AND ANXIOUS FACE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
MAINTAIN BOLDLY THAT ALL THREE OF YOU KNEW--MIND ALL THREE OF YOU FOR IF THERE IS A DOUBT ABOUT ANY ONE OF YOU THERE WILL BE A DOUBT ABOUT ALL,--PERSIST I SAY THAT YOU KNEW THAT THE KING AND M
I AM A SOLDIER OF YOUR MAJESTY AND NOTHING ELSE
IT IS IMPARTIAL
THE BALLET WILL TAKE PLACE THIS EVENING M
HEAVEN FORBID
BUCKINGHAM HOPELESSLY INFURIATED RAISED HIS WHIP
THE KING COMPREHENDED HIM AND YIELDING TO SO MUCH GENEROSITY AND ADDRESS HE SAID YOU PRAISE M
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THAT I AM IN THE HABIT OF MAKING A MISTAKE
MADAME YOU OVERWHELM ME BENEATH A LOAD OF HAPPINESS WILL YOU BE HAPPY THEN IF I AM YOURS--ENTIRELY IT WILL BE THE SUPREMEST HAPPINESS FOR ME TAKE ME THEN
WHO TOO AMONG ALL THE YOUTHFUL HEADS THERE COULD RECALL THE PAST FOR HER,--THAT PAST IN WHICH ALONE SHE LIVED
ON THAT NIGHT MALICORNE WAS ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR SEATED AT HIS WINDOW TOWARD ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN MANICAMP APPEARED ON HORSEBACK WITH A THOUGHTFUL AND LISTLESS AIR
AND AFTERWARDS AS IF DRIVEN BY A CURRENT OF AIR FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WAS NOW ADVANCING SLOWLY AND HEAVILY TOWARDS THEM
HIS OWN PERSONAL DISAPPOINTMENT SEEMED CONTEMPTIBLE IN COMPARISON WITH THE ANGER OF THE KING
DO YOU KNOW THAT MONSIEUR REFUSES TO SEE ME WHY SO CAN YOU NOT GUESS WHY AH MADAME
AS FOUQUET LOOKED AT THE FINE AND DELICATE WRITING ON THE ENVELOPE HE STARTED WITH DELIGHT
DE SAINT-AIGNAN BEGAN TO THINK WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN THE PRESENT POSITION OF AFFAIRS
SIRE SIRE AND UPON THIS DOUBT OF LA VALLIERE THE KING'S KISSES BECAME SO WARM THAT SAINT-AIGNAN THOUGHT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO RETIRE BEHIND THE TAPESTRY
BUT AT THIS MOMENT MY DEAR AURE I DECLARE TO YOU THAT I WISH FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SO BE AT EASE YOU ARE A FRIGHTFUL MAN MALICORNE
I HAVE BEEN ALREADY TOLD THAT
I WILL HAVE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM QUIT THE PRINCESS I WILL HAVE HIM QUIT FRANCE AND I WILL SEE THAT MY WISHES ARE INTIMATED TO HIM YOU WILL INTIMATE NOTHING OF THE KIND PHILIP SAID THE QUEEN FOR IF YOU ACT IN THAT MANNER AND VIOLATE HOSPITALITY TO THAT EXTENT I WILL INVOKE THE SEVERITY OF THE KING AGAINST YOU DO YOU THREATEN ME MADAME EXCLAIMED PHILIP ALMOST IN TEARS
SO THAT NO DOUBT WHATEVER REMAINS ON THE SUBJECT
WHAT MONTALAIS SAID OF MALICORNE A MERE JEST
YOU AFFECT IGNORANCE SURELY IN WHAT WAY MONSEIGNEUR YOU ARE A FRIEND OF DE GUICHE WHO IS ONE OF THE FRIENDS OF THE PRINCE THAT MAY BE SO MONSEIGNEUR
I MEAN THAT THEY WISHED TO KEEP YOU IN IGNORANCE OF THE AFFAIR ALTOGETHER BUT WHY SHOULD THEY WISH TO CONCEAL IT FROM ME FROM THE FEAR THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR THE YOUNG QUEEN MIGHT INDUCE YOU TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT TO HER NOTHING MORE MADAME HUNG DOWN HER HEAD
AT LEAST I SUPPOSE SO SAID ARAMIS WITH A SLIGHT TREMOR IN HIS VOICE
THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE SHE SAID AND YOU LOVE ME THEN VERY MUCH MADLY
THE KING WAS HANDSOME YOUNG AND OF UNEQUALED GALLANTRY
HE ACCORDINGLY DID SO AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE HEDGE
RAOUL IS TO SEE THE KING TO-MORROW WHEN HIS MAJESTY WILL INFORM HIM OF HIS WISHES RESPECTING A CERTAIN MARRIAGE
HIS SAFETY IS CONCERNED
YOU SPOKE OF OVERTHROWING KINGS AND REPLACING THEM BY OTHERS
HIS NOTICE OF HER AND HIS COLDNESS OF MANNER WERE OBSERVED BY ALL
DE GUICHE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FRIENDLY AGAIN TELL ME WHAT DID M
AGREED MADAME I WILL THINK OVER MY PLAN OF ATTACK
THE SHOWER OF RAIN
RAOUL TREMBLING AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE MERELY MUTTERED A FEW WORDS OF RESPECT
THERE ARE CERTAIN FRIENDS WHO RESEMBLE THOSE FOLLOWERS OF ANCIENT TIMES WHO CAUSED THEMSELVES TO BE BURIED ALIVE AT THEIR MASTERS FEET
DE WARDES WAS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE HOTEL DE VILLE ENGAGING IN ATTENDING TO THE EXECUTION OF SOME ORDERS BY DE GUICHE
YOU ARE MY SON I OWE YOU A MOTHER'S INDULGENCE OH SAY WHAT YOU THINK
HE THEN ADVANCED TOWARDS THE PATH IN ORDER TO LOOK ROUND AND RETURNED SOMEWHAT THOUGHTFULLY TO LA VALLIERE
PRECISELY AS M
YOU NEGATIVE EVERYTHING I PROPOSE
REALLY MONSIEUR MANICAMP SHE SAID IN A VOICE WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING THE REPROACHES SHE ADDRESSED TO HIM PRESERVED A MARKED TONE OF COQUETRY REALLY YOUR INDISCRETION IS OF A VERY DANGEROUS CHARACTER
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN A SINGLE SYLLABLE YOU UTTERED BUT DID YOU THINK WHAT YOU WERE SAYING LOUISE BECAME CONFUSED
I AM ONLY TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD AND MY GRIEF AT HIS LOSS OUGHT NOT ALWAYS TO CONTROL EVERY ACTION AND THOUGHT OF MY LIFE
BUT INQUIRED FOUQUET WITH SOME REMAINING UNEASINESS HOW IS IT THAT WHILE YOU ARE NOW SQUANDERING MILLIONS IN THIS MANNER A FEW DAYS AGO YOU DID NOT PAY THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS TO BAISEMEAUX OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET BECAUSE A FEW DAYS AGO I WAS AS POOR AS JOB AND TO-DAY TO-DAY I AM WEALTHIER THAN THE KING HIMSELF VERY WELL SAID FOUQUET
IT IS SUPPRESSED FAR FROM IT SIRE
AND I THANK HEAVEN I HAVE KNOWN M
AND YOU ENJOIN MY SISTER-IN-LAW TO BE SATISFIED AND REQUIRE ME TO BE SATISFIED TOO YOU ARE RAVING MY DEAR PHILIP SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA
NO NO SAID THE PRINCE
THE ACTION WAS BEGUN AND IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR AUDITORY OR NARRATOR TO DRAW BACK
AT THE SOUND OF WHICH THE KING AND SAINT-AIGNAN INCREASED THE RAPIDITY OF THEIR PACE
YOU TAKE ONLY MY EVIL DISPOSITIONS AND MY WEAKNESSES INTO CALCULATION AND DO NOT SPEAK OF MY PURE AND GENEROUS FEELINGS
THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME VERY SELDOM WE MAY LOOK UPON YOU AS A PROPHETESS THEN I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I DREAM BUT VERY RARELY
YOU SPEAK OF FREQUENT VISITS AND CERTAIN PREFERENCES--VERY GOOD
BE DEVOTED TO THE AFFECTION ITSELF IN GIVING A NAME TO YOUR IDEALITY AH YOU TURN AWAY
I WILL SPEAK TO THE VICOMTE LOVE SIRE IS OVERWHELMING IN ITS MIGHT LOVE CAN BE RESISTED COMTE
WITHIN TEN MINUTES AFTER I HAD RECEIVED THE ORDER I WAS READY
AH SHE SAID LA VALLIERE--SHE WHO YESTERDAY SHE PAUSED AND THEN CONTINUED SHE WHO WAS TAKEN ILL I BELIEVE YES MADAME
LOOK SHE CALLS YOU,--DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I SHALL FAIL SHE SAID RAISING HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES BUT NOT AS YOU BEG ME FOR ALL THIS INCENSE WHICH YOU WISH TO BURN ON THE ALTAR OF ANOTHER DIVINITY
LET US BOTH GO THERE
YOU DO NOT ANSWER ME WHAT WOULD YOU THAT I SHOULD REPLY YES OR NO
IT WAS MADAME DE SAINT-REMY WHO UTTERED THE CRY AND THE ANGRY WORDS
CONFESS SAID DE WARDES THAT YOU ARE REALLY ILL AND THAT YOUR PEDAGOGUE OF A FRIEND HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN CURING YOU I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID THE COUNT
FOUQUET AND M
AND BY WHAT MIRACLE CAN I EXERCISE SUCH AN INFLUENCE OVER M
IN THAT CASE SAID MADAME IN A SUFFOCATED VOICE ARISING DOUBTLESS FROM HER HURRIED PROGRESS IN THAT CASE I FORBID YOU AND MADAME AGAIN INCREASED HER PACE
AS A FRIEND!--WELL AND WHY NOT
HARDLY THEREFORE HAD HE FINISHED HIS CONFERENCE AND ENTERED HIS OWN APARTMENT THAN HE DESIRED HIS TWO MASTERS OF THE CEREMONIES VILLEROY AND SAINT-AIGNAN TO BE SENT FOR
FOR A VERY SIMPLE REASON RETURNED ANNE OF AUSTRIA
MONSIEUR LOVE ME
HE THEN OBSERVED BY THE DOOR WHICH REMAINED HALF-OPENED BEHIND MALICORNE LA VALLIERE SITTING IN AN ARMCHAIR WITH HER HEAD THROWN BACK AND IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER MONTALAIS WHO IN HER DRESSING-GOWN WAS STANDING BEFORE A LOOKING-GLASS ENGAGED IN ARRANGING HER HAIR AND PARLEYING THE WHILE WITH MALICORNE
THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THE WHOLE COURT
DE GUICHE WAS TALKING WITH HER ALONE--AH
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT I ONE DAY TOLD YOU NOT TO MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY IF YOU POSSESSED COURAGE
YES MONSIEUR YOU SAY TRULY:--WHEREVER YOU WERE YOU WERE THE KING'S
SUCH IS THE REASON MY DEAR MARQUISE WHY I FELT MYSELF IMPRESSED IN FAVOR OF THAT POOR MAN WHO ONCE LOVED AND EVEN ADORED ME
IN FACT HE HAD OCCASION TO CONGRATULATE HIMSELF RATHER THAN TO COMPLAIN OF IT
HE IS DIGNITY HIMSELF
NOT IN LOVE WELL THEN
MONSEIGNEUR HE SAID I PLACED THE LETTER ON THE VERY PLACE I TOLD YOU
FROM THE ACCUSED SHE BECAME THE ACCUSER
THE JEWELER BOWED AND LEFT THE HOUSE DIRECTING THAT THE VAN SHOULD FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY SAYING ALOUD THAT THE MARQUISE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE HER PLATE MELTED DOWN IN ORDER TO HAVE OTHER PLATE MANUFACTURED OF A MORE MODERN STYLE
IT WAS MORE THAN A WEAKNESS OF MONSIEUR AND THE PRINCESS HAD UNDERTAKEN THE AMAZING TASK OF CURING HIM OF IT
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SAID MONTALAIS
CHAPTER XXXV
IN EVERY DIRECTION COULD BE SEEN CANDELABRA MIRRORS AND FURNITURE AND FITTINGS OF THE MOST SUMPTUOUS CHARACTER
I SHOULD THINK SO
BOTH THEIR BODIES WHICH SEEMED LIKE PHANTOMS TO THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING AT THEM FROM THE SHORE WERE THROWN STRONGLY INTO RELIEF BY A DARK RED VIOLET-COLORED SHADOW WITH WHICH THE SKY BECAME OVERSPREAD
NOR I REPEATED IN A CHORUS THE GROUP OF COURTIERS
FOR THE COMTE DE LA FERE SEATED IN THE RECESS OF A WINDOW AWAITED HIM
WHEN MADAME APPROACHED HER HORSE A MAGNIFICENT ANIMAL OF ANDALUSIAN BREED OF SPOTLESS WHITE SOMEWHAT HEAVY PERHAPS BUT WITH A SPIRITED AND SPLENDID HEAD IN WHICH THE MIXTURE HAPPILY COMBINED OF ARABIAN AND SPANISH BLOOD COULD BE READILY TRACED AND WHOSE LONG TAIL SWEPT THE GROUND
BUT HIS DEPARTURE IS UNNECESSARY
AS HE ENTERED MONSIEUR WAS STRUCK AT BEHOLDING SO MANY PERSONS ENJOYING THEMSELVES WITHOUT HIM
WHEN HE ENTERED MADAME'S ROOM LOUIS FOUND HIS SISTER-IN-LAW RECLINING UPON THE CUSHIONS OF HER CABINET
SO MUCH SO INDEED THAT HER SUFFERINGS AGAIN RETURNED AND MADE HER TURN SUDDENLY PALE IN THE VERY MIDST OF HER ENJOYMENT
I AM CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS
AND HAVING DISCOVERED RAOUL SHE AMUSED HERSELF WITH THE PROFOUND ASTONISHMENT WHICH HER OWN AND HER FRIEND'S PRESENCE THERE CAUSED THE UNHAPPY LOVER
BUT THAT DOES NOT TELL ME WHY LOUISE SHOULD BEAR ME ILL-WILL DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE VERY AMUSING FOR HER TO BE BURIED ALIVE AT BLOIS WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO SHINE AT PARIS BUT MADAME IT IS NOT I WHO PREVENT LOUISE FOLLOWING ME THITHER
WHAT IS IT THE KING'S WISHES ON THE SUBJECT THE KING OPPOSES YOUR MARRIAGE HE POSTPONES IT AT LEAST
WE ALL KNOW THAT KING CHARLES II WHO APPRECIATES TRUE GENTLEMEN CANNOT DISPENSE WITH YOU
THE COUNT HAD SCARCELY ARRIVED WHEN THROUGH RAOUL HE SOLICITED AN AUDIENCE OF THE KING
IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS A HUNDRED BOATS WERE LAUNCHED
RAOUL BRAGELONNE WERE TO SUSPECT IT HE WOULD EITHER KILL HER OR KILL HIMSELF RAOUL POOR FELLOW
IN THE EVENINGS BALLS AND CONCERTS YOU ARE JEALOUS PHILIP I
VERY WELL THAT IS QUITE SUFFICIENT
FOR SOME MINUTES SHE BURIED HER FACE IN HER COLD FINGERS AND THEN RAISING HER HEAD RANG FOR HER ATTENDANTS WITH A STEADY HAND AND WITH A GESTURE BETRAYING A FIXED DETERMINATION OF PURPOSE
IT WAS THEREFORE EASY PROVIDED ONE SECURED AN APARTMENT AT THE ANGLE OF THE BUILDING TO OBTAIN BY THE MAIN STREET FROM PARIS A VIEW OF AS WELL AS TO HEAR THE PASSERS-BY AND THE FETES
I LOOKED AT HER EYES AND I CAN READ EYES WELL YOU THINK SHE CAN BE RELIED UPON FROM MY HEART I DO WELL I THINK WE ARE MISTAKEN IN WHAT WAY I THINK THAT IN POINT OF FACT AS SHE HERSELF TOLD YOU SHE DID NOT RECEIVE THE LETTER WHAT
THEY WERE ALONE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE DARK AND SILENT FOREST AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD BUT RAOUL'S HASTILY RETREATING FOOTSTEPS ALONG THE OBSCURE PATHS
YET HE CONTINUED HOW ABOUT THIS MEETING WHICH IS TO TAKE PLACE AND WHICH HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE IN THIS HOTEL
BUT IN CHANGING YOUR GARRISON BELIEVE ME YOU WILL FIND AN ADVANCEMENT OF WHICH YOU ARE WORTHY RAOUL SAW THAT THIS ENDED WHAT THE KING HAD TO SAY TO HIM
SHE POSSESSED ONE OF THOSE FEARLESS AND INCAUTIOUS DISPOSITIONS THAT FIND GRATIFICATION IN AN EXCESS OF SENSITIVENESS OF FEELING AND FOR WHOM ALSO DANGER HAS A CERTAIN FASCINATION
I LEAVE IT TO YOUR DELICACY OF FEELING TO EXCULPATE AND TO PROTECT ME MY DEAR SISTER MURMURED THE KING OVERPOWERED BY THIS BOLD ATTACK HAVE YOU REFLECTED UPON THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY OF THE PROJECT YOU HAVE CONCEIVED SIRE I DO NOT REFLECT I FEEL
FOURTEEN BE IT
WILL YOU NOT SCOLD ME FOR IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAS STILL TWENTY YEARS OF YOUTH TO ENJOY AND A THOUSAND MILLION FRANCS TO LAVISH IN THOSE TWENTY YEARS THAT IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY M
THE KING WENT TO REJOIN THE QUEENS
AT PRESENT I AM NO MORE A THINKING ACTING BEING
DE GUICHE'S APARTMENTS NOTHING EASIER
CHAPTER LX
I DO NOT SEND YOU AWAY MY DEAR FELLOW
BUT LET ME REFLECT WHAT ABOUT IT WOULD BE BETTER PERHAPS IF I WERE TO GO AND SEE MADAME IN HER OWN APARTMENT WOULD THAT NOT SEEM A SOMEWHAT SERIOUS STEP TO TAKE YES
IN OUR PROFESSION A MERE GLANCE AND A GOOD MEMORY ARE QUITE SUFFICIENT BAISEMEAUX DID NOT CHANGE COUNTENANCE AND THE SOLDIERS TOOK ARAMIS FOR WHAT HE SEEMED TO BE
WITH THIS OBJECT IN VIEW SHE SAW THE YOUNG QUEEN WHOM AS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN SHE HAD INVITED TO PAY HER A VISIT IN THE MORNING
MONTALAIS LEARNED IN THAT SPECIES OF WARFARE WHICH CONSISTS OF SUSTAINED SKIRMISHING PROTECTED THE WHOLE LINE BY A SORT OF ROLLING FIRE SHE DIRECTED AGAINST THE ENEMY
THE TRUNK SOMEWHAT ROUGH TO RECLINE AGAINST WAS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE TO ACCOMMODATE THE THREE YOUNG GIRLS WHOSE VOICES WERE LOST AMONG THE BRANCHES WHICH STRETCHED UPWARDS TO THE SKY
YOU CANNOT DECIDE WHETHER THE WORLD IS CALUMNIATING YOU OR NOT
THIS IS WHAT I CLAIM FROM YOU MY FRIEND MY ALMOST BROTHER
D'ARTAGNAN WHAT IS THAT THAT WHILE YOU RECEIVED YOUR APPOINTMENT AS CAPTAIN FROM THE KING HIMSELF I RECEIVED MINE AS GOVERNOR FROM MESSIEURS TREMBLAY AND LOUVIERE QUITE RIGHT AND TREMBLAY WAS NOT A MAN TO LET YOU HAVE THE POST FOR NOTHING NOR LOUVIERE EITHER
BUT AS THE LATTER ENTERED THE GROTTO HE TURNED ROUND SAYING
THE QUEEN THEN DESIRED THAT THE OUTRIDERS SHOULD PROCEED IN THE DIRECTION OF APREMONT
OF COURSE STAMMERED LOUISE PALE AS DEATH
OH NO
BUT IT IS NOW TWO YEARS SINCE HE DIED
BUT MY DEAR BAISEMEAUX SHALL WE TALK NOW IF YOU PLEASE IN THE FIRST PLACE AS FOR THE ORDERS--THERE ARE NONE
ONLY ON THIS OCCASION DO YOU ACT MONSIEUR
ON WHAT GROUNDS INQUIRED MANICAMP WITH HIS SOFT TONE
IT APPEARS THAT MONSIEUR INDULGES IN INJUSTICE TOO YOU ARE VERY KIND SIRE MY MOTHER REASSURED HIM
SAINT-AIGNAN STOPPED TO LOOK ABOUT HIM
THE KING HAD NOTICED THE CHEERLESS ASPECT OF THE HEAVENS AS HE APPROACHED THE WINDOW IMMEDIATELY UPON RISING
I WAS YOUNG MADLY IN LOVE I POSSESSED HOWEVER SUFFICIENT RESPECT TO THROW MYSELF AT YOUR FEET AND TO PROSTRATE MYSELF IN THE DUST IF YOUR LOOKS HAD NOT RAISED ME TO YOUR HAND
SHUT YOUR LIPS THAT YOU MAY NOT INHALE THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCES ABOUT YOU
DO NOT FORGET LADIES THAT THE STORY OF THE DRYAD IS NOW BEGINNING OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE EASY TO TELL YOU WHAT TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS THE TWO MOST DISCREET SHEPHERDS OF THE WHOLE EARTH WERE TALKING ABOUT
I WAS GOING TO PARIS,--YOU ARE GOING THERE,--WE ARE GOING THERE AND SO IT WAS FOR THAT MOTIVE ONLY YOU HAVE SERVED ME
AND HE ADVANCED TOWARDS D'ARTAGNAN
SIRE I HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF A GREAT FAULT
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE LESS SENSITIVE THAN LA VALLIERE WAS NOT MUCH FRIGHTENED AND DID NOT FAINT
HE COURAGEOUSLY BEGAN THEN AMIDST A PROFOUND SILENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN FORMIDABLE TO ANY ONE BUT HIMSELF:--"MADAME BY THE KING'S PERMISSION I ADDRESS MYSELF IN THE FIRST PLACE TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SINCE YOU ADMIT YOURSELF TO BE THE PERSON PRESENT POSSESSING THE GREATEST CURIOSITY
WILL YOU GET INTO THE CARRIAGE MY DEAR M
THIS ANNE OF AUSTRIA PERCEIVED
HE ALMOST EMBRACED HIM
HE IS YOUNG YOU KNOW AND EASILY DRAWN AWAY
IF YOU TAKE TO CALLING ME NAMES AGAIN YOU KNOW THE EFFECT THEY PRODUCE UPON ME AND I SHALL ADORE YOU AND SO SAYING MALICORNE DREW THE YOUNG GIRL A SECOND TIME TOWARDS HIM
YOU WILL FIND IN CONVERSING WITH HER THAT SHE HAS NO MALICE OR UNKINDNESS IN HER NATURE AND THAT SHE IS VERY TALENTED MONSEIGNEUR YOU WILL SEE THAT SHE CAN RECEIVE HER FRIENDS LIKE A PRINCESS AND LAUGH LIKE A CITIZEN'S WIFE
HIS DEPARTURE HE MURMURED
D
I NOW REMEMBER YOU ALREADY SPOKE ABOUT IT LAST YEAR TO ME
PORTHOS IS A BRAVE FELLOW YES BUT IN THE MEAN TIME HE WILL GET BORED TO DEATH OH NO
IN QUITTING FRANCE IT WAS HER RECENTLY ADOPTED DAUGHTER HE HAD BROUGHT TO PARIS WHOM HE CHIEFLY REGRETTED
FROM MY MASTER HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM IN ORDER THAT EVERY POSSIBLE CARE MAY BE TAKEN OF THE MARQUIS DE WARDES THEN FOLLOWED BY THOSE WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM HE RETURNED TO THE BOAT WHICH BUCKINGHAM HAD BEEN ENABLED TO REACH WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY BUT ONLY AFTER HE HAD SEEN DE WARDES OUT OF DANGER
IS MADAME IN HER OWN APARTMENT I BELIEVE SO WHAT IS MY STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES TO CONSIST OF IN A FEW WORDS OF THE FOLLOWING
DE WARDES ADVANCED A STEP TO MEET HIM
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE HUNDRED LEAGUES YOU HAVE JUST RIDDEN
CHAPTER XXVI
BUT FOUQUET WITH A BOW SAID I WILL NOT SIT DOWN UNTIL YOU HAVE PARDONED ME I ASKED LA VALLIERE PARDON WHAT FOUQUET FIXED A MOST PIERCING LOOK UPON THE YOUNG GIRL AND FANCIED HE COULD PERCEIVE IN HER FACE NOTHING BUT THE MOST UNAFFECTED SURPRISE
I SHALL BLESS YOUR MAJESTY ALL MY LIFE AND I SHALL DIE THANKING AND LOVING HEAVEN FOR HAVING GRANTED ME ONE HOUR OF PERFECT HAPPINESS NO NO REPLIED THE KING YOU WILL LIVE HERE BLESSING HEAVEN ON THE CONTRARY BUT LOVING LOUIS WHO WILL MAKE YOUR EXISTENCE ONE OF PERFECT FELICITY--LOUIS WHO LOVES YOU--LOUIS WHO SWEARS IT OH
IT IS THERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN MADAME SAID MONTALAIS HIGHLY EXASPERATED
I WILL NOT PUT YOU TO THE PROOF
A MERE STEP THEN SAID LOUIS XIV
DID YOU NOT SAY THAT HE INTENDED TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF SOME APPOINTMENT IN THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD I BEG YOUR PARDON COUNT
I GUARANTEE YOU WILL DO SO
BUT NOT ABOVE MINE I PRESUME WELL SAID THE KING ALL I HAVE TO SAY PHILIP IS THAT MADAME'S CONDUCT DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR CENSURE
FOUQUET VERY SIMPLY THAT YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO M
BUT THAT THE FEELING OF HATRED TREASURED UP IN THE MIND INSTEAD OF BEING DIFFUSED ABROAD WAS STILL HATRED ALL THE SAME
YOU UNDERTAKE MUCH AND I DO NOT ASK THAT
WE SHALL HAVE TIME SAID ARAMIS TO REACH THE CARRIAGES BEFORE THE FOLIAGE BECOMES SATURATED IT WILL BE BETTER SAID FOUQUET TO TAKE SHELTER SOMEWHERE--IN A GROTTO FOR INSTANCE YES BUT WHERE ARE WE TO FIND A GROTTO INQUIRED ARAMIS
LA VALLIERE HE SAID HAS NEVER LOVED AND NEVER WILL LOVE ANY ONE BUT THE KING AT ALL EVENTS SAID FOUQUET WHAT WOULD YOU DO ASK ME RATHER WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WELL
THE LARGE APARTMENT IS MY OWN AFFAIR BUT I WISH THE PRICE OF THE SMALLER ROOM TO BE MODERATE AS IT IS DESTINED FOR A FELLOW WHO IS DEUCEDLY POOR IT IS STILL YOU HE IS SPEAKING OF IS HE NOT SAID THE HOST
I WILL GO AND LOOK FOR THE COUNT AND BRING HIM BACK WITH ME AH
I FORGOT THAT IN SPEAKING THUS I AM ATTACKING YOUR SOVEREIGN POWER I ASSURE YOU MY DEAR SISTER IT WAS NOT I WHO DISMISSED THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
AND IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED I CONFESS VERY WELL SAID BAISEMEAUX AND HE TOOK OUT OF A CUPBOARD A LARGE REGISTER
I DO NOT KNOW HIM EVEN IN ANY CASE SAID DE GUICHE WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SEVERITY IN HIS TONE OF VOICE DO NOT FORGET ONE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT RAOUL IS MY MOST INTIMATE FRIEND A REMARK AT WHICH DE WARDES BOWED
AND MALICORNE OF SOME PLACE OR EVEN DE MALICORNE ITSELF FOR SHORT WOULD RING MORE NOBLY ON THE EAR
IT IS THAT GENTLEMAN THERE SAID MONTALAIS POINTING TO MALICORNE WHO DURING THIS SCENE HAD PRESERVED THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE COOLNESS AND THE MOST COMIC DIGNITY
FOURTEEN LEAGUES MAKES SEVEN POSTS
AND MY FINGERS AT THE END OF THE ENGAGEMENT WERE I WELL REMEMBER TIRED ENOUGH IT IS THEN AS I SAID RESUMED ATHOS THE SON WILL ALWAYS BE LOOKING OUT FOR RAOUL AND WILL END BY MEETING HIM
SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING HIS IMAGINATION HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY CLOTHING HER IMAGE WITH CHARMS TO WHICH SHE COULD NOT LAY CLAIM
THE LADIES PRESENT--NOTHING ESCAPES A WOMAN'S GLANCE--MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS FOR INSTANCE--DID NOT FAIL TO SAY TO EACH OTHER THE KING SIGHED AND MADAME SIGHED TOO THIS HAD BEEN INDEED THE CASE
HE WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH HER YESTERDAY AND THE LETTER IS DATED YESTERDAY
TO SPEAK THAT WORD IN THE CABINET OF THE KING AND BEFORE AN USHER WOULD HAVE BEEN TO RUIN HIMSELF GRATUITOUSLY AND COULD SAVE NOBODY
MAKE HASTE
IS IT A SECRET IT OUGHT TO BE A SECRET AND A VERY GREAT ONE EVEN
ALWAYS THE SAME JAILER
YOU ARE AWARE MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE CARDINAL CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION IN CASTILIAN THAT THE CONDITION OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE INFANTA WITH THE KING OF FRANCE WAS THE ABSOLUTE RENUNCIATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE SAID INFANTA AS WELL AS OF KING LOUIS XIV TO ALL CLAIM TO THE CROWN OF SPAIN THE FRANCISCAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
I HAVE DECIDED BRAGELONNE
IF I GIVE YOU THE TWENTY PISTOLES SHALL I HAVE MY BREVET TO BE SURE YOU SHALL SOON TO-DAY OH
A FEEBLE LIGHT STILL GLIMMERED IN MADAME'S APARTMENT WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON THE SQUARE AND THE SOFT RAYS FROM THE EXPIRING LAMP SEEMED TO BE THE IMAGE OF THE CALM SLEEP OF A YOUNG GIRL HARDLY YET SENSIBLE OF LIFE'S ANXIETIES AND IN WHOM THE FLAME OF EXISTENCE SINKS PLACIDLY AS SLEEP STEALS OVER THE BODY
BAISEMEAUX LED THE WAY DOWN SEVERAL STEPS WHICH CONDUCTED TO A SORT OF ESPLANADE
YES MONSIEUR I BELIEVE YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH MY VIEWS RESPECTING THIS ALLIANCE YES MONSIEUR REPLIED RAOUL IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
IT WAS WITH SUCH IDEAS AS THESE WHICH THE FIRE OF COVETOUSNESS HAD CAUSED TO DAWN IN HALF AN HOUR THAT SAINT-AIGNAN THE SON OF EARTH AS LA FONTAINE WOULD HAVE SAID DETERMINED TO GET DE GUICHE INTO CONVERSATION
NOR EVEN AGAINST THE NATURE OF THAT WOMAN
HOW HAS HIS JEALOUSY SUBSIDED IT HAS BEEN DIVERTED INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT A REPORT WAS SPREAD THAT THE KING HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SOME ONE ELSE AND MONSIEUR WAS TRANQUILLIZED IMMEDIATELY AND WHO SPREAD THE REPORT MONTALAIS LOWERED HER VOICE
LET US GET THERE
LET HIM BE INTRODUCED
IF INDEED SHE ADDED HASTILY HER NAME IS NOT A SECRET NO MADAME MY AFFECTION IS TOO PURE FOR ME TO MAKE A SECRET OF IT TO ANY ONE AND WITH STILL GREATER REASON TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WHOSE KINDNESS TOWARDS ME HAS BEEN SO EXTREME
HE HAS SIRE REALLY M
YOU MARGUERITE WHO ARE THE MODEL OF A WIFE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME IF I WERE TO SAY SO WHY NOT
AND WHEN THE TIME IS PASSED IN GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYTHING A FORTNIGHT IS AN ETERNITY SO THAT YOU WILL NOT FORGIVE HER NEVER COME COME DE GUICHE BE A BETTER DISPOSED FELLOW THAN THAT
IT IS EXTRAORDINARY
BUT WHAT MADE MONTALAIS HOLD TO MALICORNE IN AN INDISSOLUBLE FASHION WAS THAT MALICORNE ALWAYS CAME CRAM FULL OF FRESH NEWS FROM THE COURT AND THE CITY
IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE MAGNIFICENT FETES OF FONTAINEBLEAU MIGHT HAVE BEEN RENDERED MORE MAGNIFICENT STILL
NO HE SAID
HE SUDDENLY BROKE THROUGH THE SETTLED DESPAIR THAT OVERWHELMED HIM AND FLEW TO HIDE HIMSELF IN HIS OWN ROOM WHERE RAOUL AWAITED HIM IMMOVABLE IN HIS OWN SAD PRESENTIMENTS
HAVING RETREATED A STEP HE PARRIED THREE OR FOUR FIERCE THRUSTS WHICH DE WARDES MADE AT HIM CAUGHT THE SWORD OF THE LATTER WITH WITHIN HIS OWN AND SENT IT FLYING TWENTY PACES THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER
NAY MORE THAN THAT I AM PERSUADED IT IS YOUR MOTHER'S DESIRE I SHOULD DO SO DESIRE EXCLAIMED THE KING
DE GUICHE AND THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WHAT A DISTURBANCE REPLIED DE WARDES ATTEMPTING TO SMILE
THE KING WALKED STRAIGHT UP TO THE YOUNG QUEEN
WHAT REASON HAS HE A VERY EXCELLENT ONE REPLIED MANICAMP
DE BRAGELONNE BY INSULTING HIS MOTHER
SHE APPEARS TO-DAY IN HER COSTUME OF POMONA YES THAT IS SO EXCLAIMED THE COUNT
HE MONOPOLIZED EVERY EMBROIDERER JEWELER AND TAILOR THAT PARIS COULD BOAST OF
NOT A RIPPLE COULD BE NOTICED ON THE SURFACE OF THE GREEN WATERS
ARAMIS EVEN WHILE HE BECAME PALER THAN THE DYING MAN HIMSELF BENT HIS LOOKS SUCCESSIVELY UPON ALL THE ACTORS OF THIS SCENE
DO YOU KNOW THAT TO OBTAIN THE FAVOR I PROPOSE TO YOU GRATIS SOME OF THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD HAVE OFFERED ME AS MUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS REALLY
DE MONTALAIS
WITH THIS SIGN YOU WILL OVERTHROW
AND YET THE SEA RAN SO HIGH THAT THEIR SPEED WAS AS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE ROLLING OF THE BILLOWS IN WHICH THE VESSELS WERE PLUNGING FIRST IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN IN ANOTHER
I AM ABOUT TO PUT YOUR FRIENDSHIP TO THE PROOF
IT WAS NOT AN UNIMPORTANT MATTER FOR MADAME IN THE PRESENT POSITION OF AFFAIRS TO LET THE KING PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE BESTOWAL OF HIS AFFECTIONS ON ONE IN A HIGH STATION AND THE RUNNING AFTER EACH PASSING FANCY LIKE A YOUTH FRESH FROM THE PROVINCES
IT HAS BEEN SAID--"HE WHO SLEEPS DINES BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN AFFIRMED--HE WHO SLEEPS PLAYS--OR HE WHO SLEEPS DANCES
I CANNOT BUT APPLAUD SUCH A DETERMINATION AND I DO APPLAUD IT I DO NOT GIVE IN MY RESIGNATION MADAME
YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT ME TO BE BRIEFER SPEAK MONSIEUR I AM LISTENING ARE YOU OR IS THE DUKE OF ORLEANS GOING TO MARRY THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF HENRY IV WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXCLAIMED BUCKINGHAM RETREATING A FEW STEPS BEWILDERED
I DID NOT SAY THAT A WOMAN WHO SEES A MAN PERISH CONSUMED BY THE FIRE SHE HAS KINDLED AND WHO DOES NOT ALLAY THAT FIRE IS IN MY OPINION A WORTHLESS WOMAN WHAT CAN IT MATTER TO YOU WHAT I SAID RETURNED THE COMTE
DE WARDES AND IN VERY TRUTH TOO MANY PRECAUTIONS CANNOT BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU I SHALL TAKE MY PRECAUTIONS AGAINST YOU SAID DE WARDES BE ASSURED OF IT ALLOW ME MONSIEUR SAID BUCKINGHAM TO TRANSLATE YOUR REMARK BY A PIECE OF ADVICE I AM ABOUT TO GIVE M
TO REFORM A MAN NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT REFORMING A WOMAN HOW WILL YOU SET ABOUT IT WITH A WORD TO GUICHE WHO IS A CLEVER FELLOW I WILL UNDERTAKE TO CONVINCE HIM BUT MADAME THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT
ONE'S FRIENDS ARE AS ONE'S LOVERS
I AM NO LONGER A YOUNG MAN WHO CAN MAKE TERMS WITH THE MEANNESS OF THE DAY
FOR IF M
COURSES DE NUIT
DO NOT ANSWER A WORD
BECAUSE MADAME HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND WHO IS ABOUT TO BECOME THE WIFE OF S
BUT WOMEN ARE THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES TRUE
LORET SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN INTRUSTED WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF SOME WATER-NYMPH AS HE HAD IN HIS VERSES RECOUNTED MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE ACTUALLY TRUE--AT WHICH REMARK MORE THAN ONE LADY PRESENT FELT HERSELF BOUND TO BLUSH
AT ALL EVENTS HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL MERIT TAKE ME UNHESITATINGLY FOR YOUR SURETY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS OVERWHELMS ME WITH KINDNESS NO
WILL YOU SWEAR THAT YOU HAVE NO INJURIOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO MAKE TO ME ABOUT HER AND THAT ANY INJURIOUS COMMUNICATIONS YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE TO MAKE ARE NOT THE CAUSE OF YOUR SILENCE OH
OH CERTAINLY SAID MALICORNE
BUT THE CRIME APPEARED TO ME SO SLIGHT SLIGHT DO YOU SAY OR RATHER SO INVOLUNTARY MY LORD IT IS NOT INVOLUNTARILY THAT SUCH A RESEMBLANCE IS DETECTED WELL THE FACT IS I HAD FORGOTTEN IT
PERSUADED THAT AT THE LEAST RELAXING OF THE TIES BY WHICH HE HAD BOUND HIS PROTEAN FEMALE THE DEMON WOULD OVERTHROW AND LAUGH AT HIM
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE AND MONTALAIS WHO STOOD A FEW PACES FROM THE KING AND LA VALLIERE MOTIONLESS AND ALMOST PETRIFIED AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR CONVERSATION WITH LA VALLIERE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF OFFERING THEIR ASSISTANCE FEELING RESTRAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE KING WHO WITH ONE KNEE ON THE GROUND HELD LA VALLIERE ROUND THE WAIST WITH HIS ARM
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW ME THE FRIENDSHIP OF A BROTHER THE ATTENTION OF A BROTHER THE GALLANTRY OF A MONARCH WILL YOU NOT I WILL PRESERVE FOR YOU INTACT A HEART THAT HAS ALREADY BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO BEAT ONLY AT YOUR COMMAND VERY WELL DO YOU NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE FUTURE BY THIS MEANS I HOPE SO WILL YOUR MOTHER CEASE TO REGARD ME AS AN ENEMY YES WILL MARIA THERESA LEAVE OFF SPEAKING IN SPANISH BEFORE MONSIEUR WHO HAS A HORROR OF CONVERSATION HELD IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES BECAUSE HE ALWAYS THINKS HE IS BEING ILL SPOKEN OF
BUT TELL ME BEFOREHAND MY LORD WHETHER YOU WILL DO ME THE HONOR TO BREAKFAST WITH ME AS USUAL VERY WILLINGLY INDEED THAT'S WELL SAID BAISEMEAUX AS HE STRUCK THE BELL BEFORE HIM THREE TIMES
SHE RELATED TO US HER FLIRTATIONS WITH MONSIEUR AND WE TOLD HER OF THE FLIRTATIONS SHE HAD HAD WITH OTHERS OR AT LEAST THE RUMORS OF THEM THAT HAD SPREAD ABROAD
DE WARDES WAS PLIANT SUBTLE FULL OF DISSIMULATION
A ROUNDISH SUM IT IS TRUE BUT NOT TOO EXORBITANT TELL ME THE AMOUNT FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS OH
A WOMAN UNWILLINGLY CONVINCED IS UNCONVINCED WHAT IS TO BE DONE THEN?--I WILL CONSULT MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT YES YOUR DOUBLE-DEALING ADVISERS YOUR CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE--YOUR DE WARDES
HE ENTERED THE ROOM LOOKING QUITE WILD BROKE INTO THE CONVERSATION AND BEGAN TO QUARREL WITH MY MOTHER SO BITTERLY THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE HIM
IN THIS MANNER AND AS IT WERE WITHOUT DESIGN HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO MONSIEUR WHO HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM AND KEPT HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN HIS OWN APARTMENTS
ADMITTING FOR AN INSTANT THAT SHE SHOULD AT LAST LOVE YOU OH NEVER EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE
THE KING'S CARD-TABLE
AND NOW WHAT IS TO BE DONE KEEP YOUR EYES AND EARS CONSTANTLY OPEN
GOD HELP ME AT THIS LAST EXCLAMATION WHICH ISSUED AS IT WERE FROM A BROKEN HEART LOUISE BURST INTO TEARS AND THREW HERSELF INTO MONTALAIS'S ARMS
WHY SO NAY MORE THAN THAT IT IS TO HER YOU MUST PRESENT YOUR CAMEOS NONSENSE YOU KNOW MONSEIGNEUR THAT MY ADVICE IS NOT TO BE REGARDED LIGHTLY BUT THIS IS UNFORESEEN THAT IS MY AFFAIR
EVERY ONE HAS LEFT
MALICORNE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU WOULD THINK
YOU MAY REMOVE THAT CAUSE BUT YOU NEVER CAN REMOVE THEIR SUFFERINGS
YOU WERE SAYING I THINK THAT YOU HAD GONE BEYOND RIS AND MELUN YES I WENT THROUGH RIS AND MELUN AND I CONTINUED TO GO ON MORE AND MORE SURPRISED THAT I DID NOT SEE HIM RETURNING
FORGIVE ME DUKE FOR WHAT I WROTE TO YOU I WAS MAD
YES INDEED HE SAID WE DID EXPECT YOU BUT WE HOPED THAT YOU WOULD ARRIVE IN A BETTER STATE OF HEALTH AND AS THE PEASANTS WERE LOOKING AT THE INNKEEPER USUALLY SO SUPERCILIOUS AND SAW HOW RESPECTFUL HE HAD BECOME IN THE PRESENCE OF A POOR MONK THE FRANCISCAN DREW FROM A DEEP POCKET THREE OR FOUR PIECES OF GOLD WHICH HE HELD OUT
DE GUICHE SOON CEASED TO SUSTAIN EVEN THE CHARACTER OF THE COURTIER
THE DOOR WAS THEN CLOSED
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THIS YOUNG FELLOW WAS NOT BORN TO EAT ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE DOES EAT
I ONLY REMEMBER HOW IT ENDS VERY WELL AT ALL EVENTS THAT IS SOMETHING WHEN MAIDS OF HONOR HAPPEN TO RUN SHORT LO!--GUICHE WILL FURNISH THE ENTIRE COURT THE IDEA IS WEAK AND THE RHYME POOR SAID DE GUICHE
HIS FATHER CAME TO ASK ME TO SIGN THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT
DID I NOT SEE HER AT THE LOUVRE WHEN SHE WAS QUITE A CHILD A GREAT CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN HER SINCE THEN PRINCE
FOR AFTER ALL THE ORCHESTRA COULD STILL JUST AS WELL CUT IT OUT IF IT WERE NECESSARY
WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED AT THE INN CALLED THE BEAU PAON
BUT YOU SPEAK A LANGUAGE WHICH REQUIRES QUITE AN APPRENTICESHIP TO UNDERSTAND VERY TRUE SAID THE GOVERNOR
THERE NOW INTERRUPTED D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING VERY RUDE AND I AM RENDERING A SERVICE BY STOPPING YOU IN TIME IS THAT ALL MONSIEUR INQUIRED DE WARDES
GIVE ME YOUR HAND
GIVE ME YOUR HAND
YES MADAME THE FORMER REPLIED
YOU ARE JOKING WILL YOU FOLLOW ME SAID BAISEMEAUX
BUT AS FAR AS CONCERNS YOUR ROOM AND A STABLE THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER FOR THEY HAVE BEEN RETAINED HERE FOR YOU RETAINED--AND BY WHOM BY YOURSELF I PRESUME BY ME DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DID NOT TAKE LODGINGS HERE BY NO MEANS SAID MANICAMP
THE KING ANXIOUS TO BE AGAIN QUITE ALONE IN ORDER TO REFLECT WELL UPON WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS HEART HAD WITHDRAWN TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS WHERE M
OH YOU KNOW SAINT-AIGNAN'S CHARACTER VERY WELL SHE SAID THE FAVOR THE KING SHOWS HIM ALMOST TURNS HIS BRAIN AND HE TALKS AT RANDOM
BUT WHEN I SPEAK I KNOW NOT HOW TO FEIGN OR TO DECEIVE
A HIT HE SAID
IN THAT CASE SAID GRISART SALUTING HIM WITH RESPECT I AM IN THE PRESENCE OF A MASTER YES
THE KING HAVING PAID MADAME THE CUSTOMARY COMPLIMENTS AND MADAME HAVING REQUESTED HIM TO BE SEATED THE CIRCLE WAS IMMEDIATELY FORMED
IF MALICORNE WERE HERE HE WOULD HAVE ALREADY HIT UPON A THOUSAND EXCELLENT PRETEXTS WHO IS MALICORNE REPLIED DE GUICHE HALF-SHUTTING HIS EYES LIKE A PERSON REFLECTING I SEEM TO KNOW THE NAME KNOW HIM
THE LATTER PERSONAGE A MAN OF FROM TWENTY-FIVE TO TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A MIEN SOMETIMES LIVELY AND SOMETIMES DULL MAKING GOOD USE OF TWO LARGE EYES SHADED WITH LONG EYE-LASHES WAS SHORT OF STATURE AND SWART OF SKIN
THE DISCUSSION WAS BECOMING FULL OF BITTERNESS
ONE OF THE OFFICERS ON DUTY GAVE IT TO ME THE VALET IN OBEDIENCE TO A GESTURE OF THE KING HANDED HIM THE LETTER
FOR SUDDENLY A BEVY OF YOUNG GIRLS RAN DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE HILLOCK FOLLOWING THE CAVALIERS--THE CAUSE OF THIS INTERRUPTION BEING A MAGNIFICENT HAWK-MOTH WITH WINGS LIKE ROSE-LEAVES
IS IT REALLY TRUE WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD BUCKINGHAM TURNED ROUND
FOR WHEN A LADY IS IN THE CASE AH
FIRST I HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST MYSELF
I CAME AT ONCE TO THE SERVANTS OFFICES AND I SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A LETTER CONVEYED TO YOU
I DELIGHT THE HEART OF SOME POOR LITTLE TRADESMAN OR CLERK BY SENDING HIM A WING OF A RED PARTRIDGE A SLICE OF VENISON OR A SLICE OF A TRUFFLED PASTY DISHES WHICH HE NEVER TASTED EXCEPT IN HIS DREAMS
IT IS A DISEASE WHICH LIES IN THE IMAGINATION AND LIKE ALL IMAGINARY DISORDERS IT IS INCURABLE
YOUR FREEDOM FROM COQUETRY IS ONE OF YOUR GREATEST CHARMS IN MY EYES SIRE DO NOT MAKE ME OUT BETTER THAN I AM AND SAY MERELY YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY BE A COQUETTE WHY SO BECAUSE SAID LA VALLIERE SMILING I AM NOT RICH YOU ADMIT THEN SAID THE KING QUICKLY THAT YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR BEAUTIFUL THINGS SIRE I ONLY REGARD THOSE THINGS AS BEAUTIFUL WHICH ARE WITHIN MY REACH
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ALL WOMEN EVEN THE LEAST CLEVER OF THE SEX INVARIABLY KNOW HOW TO DERIVE SOME SUCH MEANS OF TURNING THE TABLES
SHE WISHED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT IF HE MADE USE OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS OF THAT NATURE SHE A WOMAN OF READY WIT AND HIGH DESCENT WOULD ASSUREDLY DISCOVER IN THE ARSENAL OF HER IMAGINATION DEFENSIVE WEAPONS PROOF EVEN AGAINST THE THRUSTS OF A MONARCH
BUT OTHER THINGS MAY STILL BE SAID OF US WHAT CAN BE SAID SIRE
BUT A NEEDFUL AMOUNT IS OF IMPORTANCE
THE FRANCISCAN SUPPORTED HIS REMOVAL UP THE STAIRCASE WITHOUT UTTERING A COMPLAINT ALTHOUGH IT WAS EVIDENT HE SUFFERED VERY MUCH AND THAT EVERY TIME THE LITTER KNOCKED AGAINST THE WALL OR THE RAILING OF THE STAIRCASE HE EXPERIENCED A TERRIBLE SHOCK THROUGHOUT HIS FRAME
BESIDES WE SHALL KNOW HOW TO PACIFY HIS MAJESTY
AT THE SAME MOMENT HOWEVER DE GUICHE ADVANCED FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM DOES NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD DISCONTINUE HIS VISITS TO MY APARTMENTS I SHALL FORBID HIM ENTRANCE THAT IS A POINT YOU WILL REFER TO THE KING SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA HER HEART SWELLING AS SHE SPOKE AND HER VOICE TREMBLING WITH EMOTION
FOUQUET SUDDENLY CALLED OUT THE MAJOR FROM BELOW
I WILL NOT APPEAR IN THE MATTER BUT I SHALL INTIMATE MY WILL TO MADAME OH SAID THE QUEEN-MOTHER WITH A MELANCHOLY ARISING FROM REFLECTION NEVER TYRANNIZE OVER A WIFE--NEVER BEHAVE TOO HAUGHTILY OR IMPERIOUSLY TOWARDS YOUR OWN
DE GUICHE ANNOYS MONSIEUR
HE WAS UNPREPARED FOR SUCH UTTER INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD NEITHER SEEN NOR BEEN TOLD OF ANYTHING THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND CONSEQUENTLY COULD GUESS NOTHING
YOU MY DEAR D'HERBLAY WHO ARE SO LEARNED WILL REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF A CERTAIN TYRANT OF SAMOS
EXACTLY SIRE EXPLAIN YOURSELF IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
HE IS THE MAN WHO IS NEEDED TO PREVENT IT LEAVING NAY NAY MONSIEUR LE SURINTENDANT YOU WILL PRESENTLY SAY SOMETHING WHICH WILL CORRECT THIS GOOD OPINION DO YOU MEAN AS FAR AS ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITIES ARE CONCERNED SIRE YES NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST REALLY UPON MY HONOR SIRE I DO NOT KNOW THROUGHOUT FRANCE A BETTER CLERK THAN M
AND MOREOVER SHOWED HIMSELF SUCH AN EXCELLENT NARRATOR AND SO DISCERNINGLY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE KING LISTENED TO HIM WITH AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT INTEREST PARTICULARLY WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE EXCITED MANNER WITH WHICH MADAME HAD SOUGHT FOR HIM TO CONVERSE ABOUT THE AFFAIR OF MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
NO CRIED DE WARDES NOT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE
AS THEREFORE IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT RAOUL WHOM HE COULD SUSPECT EITHER OF INTRIGUE OR TREACHERY IT WAS ON RAOUL'S ACCOUNT THAT DE GUICHE TREMBLED
FLY BUT TO PRONOUNCE THAT WORD WOULD HAVE BEEN TO BETRAY HIS CAUSE
AND I INVITE SAID THE KING FINISHING ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOW PRESENT TO GET READY TO ACCOMPANY ME SMILING FACES WERE NOW EVERYWHERE VISIBLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MONSIEUR WHO SEEMED TO RETAIN HIS ILL-HUMOR
FOR AS YET HE IS ONLY ON TRIAL
IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
ANNE OF AUSTRIA DID NOT ENTERTAIN FOR M
ALWAYS OBSERVING BE IT UNDERSTOOD THE PROPRIETIES AND FLATTERING EVEN WHEN HE APPEARED TO BE BANTERING
ASSUREDLY NOT REPLIED RAOUL EAGERLY YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT SUCH IS NOT MY FEELING
THEY PLACED IT IN A SMALL CABINET ANTE-ROOM OR BOUDOIR RATHER ADJOINING THE SALOON WHERE WE ONCE SAW M
SHE WHAT DID SHE SAY AND DO SHE SAID THAT HER DRESS SUITED HER ADMIRABLY AND THEN SHE LAUGHED A FIT OF HYSTERIC LAUGHTER SEEMED TO SHATTER HIS NERVES FOR HE FELL BACKWARDS COMPLETELY OVERCOME
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF I HOPE NOTHING DO YOU EVER FEEL WEARY SAID ARAMIS
SHE HAD NOTHING TO COMPENSATE HER FOR HER SUFFERINGS NOT A KIND WORD FROM HER COMPANIONS NOR A LOOK OF AFFECTION FROM THE KING
ADMIT HIM AT ONCE SAID RAOUL EAGERLY
BUT STAY MADAME CONTINUED WE ARE QUITE FORGETTING THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S DREAM WAS NOTHING BUT A DREAM I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED RETURNED ANNE OF AUSTRIA IF MY DREAM WERE TO DECEIVE ME
PHILIP HAS TOO MUCH AFFECTION FOR ME FOR THAT AND I ON MY SIDE HAVE TOO GREAT A REGARD FOR HIM
SAINT-AIGNAN WAS CHARGED WITH A MISSION THAT REQUIRED DISPATCH AND HE WAS GOING TO DO HIS UTMOST TO TURN HIS TIME TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
YOUR HAND IS LIKE ICE IT IS NOTHING THIS COLDNESS DOES NOT REACH YOUR HEART LOUISE DOES IT INQUIRED THE YOUNG MAN WITH A TENDER SMILE
YOU TELL ME YOU LOVE ME
BESIDES PLEASURE FORMS THE TISSUE OF WHICH SHE WISHES HER LIFE TO BE WOVEN
AT LAST SAID ATHENAIS THE FIRST TO INTERRUPT THE SILENCE AT LAST WE ARE ALONE FREE TO TALK OF YESTERDAY'S GREAT AFFAIR AND TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING UPON THE CONDUCT IT IS ADVISABLE FOR US TO PURSUE
NOTHING FURTHER INTERRUPTED THE JOURNEY
I AM DETERMINED ENOUGH AGAINST THE VICIOUSLY DISPOSED BUT NOT SO AGAINST MEN OF UPRIGHT CHARACTER
MALICORNE LIKE A WOLF
IT SERVED ME FOR THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT FAIL
THE SECOND APPOINTMENT IS FOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE UNKNOWN SAID DE GUICHE
BUT NOW FOR THEIR PORTRAITS SAINT-AIGNAN AGAIN MADE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT
THEN BY ONE OF THE SIDE PATHS A DESCRIPTION OF WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN THEY ADVANCED TO MEET MONSIEUR WHO HAVING JUST FINISHED BATHING WAS RETURNING TOWARDS THE CHATEAU WEARING A WOMAN'S VEIL TO PROTECT HIS FACE FROM GETTING BURNT BY THE SUN WHICH WAS SHINING VERY BRIGHTLY
HEAVEN HE EXCLAIMED SUDDENLY
THE WOLF WHICH TERRIFIED YOU SO MUCH WAS SIMPLY A WOLF WITH TWO LEGS IT WAS A MAN THEN SAID LOUISE
DE MAZARIN'S HANDWRITING
HER LOOK HAD SAID TO HIM
THE RESULT OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE STRANGER AND OF THE SICK FRANCISCAN WAS MALICORNE'S EXPULSION WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION FOR HIS FEELINGS FROM THE INN BY THE LANDLORD AND THE PEASANTS WHO HAD CARRIED THE FRANCISCAN
IT IS AN INFALLIBLE SIGN OF GUILT
THE HOUSEHOLD BELONGING TO MONSIEUR AWAITED HIS COMMAND TO MOUNT THEIR HORSES IN ORDER TO FORM PART OF THE ESCORT OF THE AMBASSADORS TO WHOM HAD BEEN INTRUSTED THE CARE OF BRINGING THE YOUNG PRINCESS TO PARIS
NO ONE DISPLAYS GREATER ADDRESS IN HUNTING WILD BEASTS NOR GREATER WISDOM IN MATTERS WHERE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED
HAVING TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE LADDER HE STEPPED ON IT AND THEN GALLANTLY OFFERED HIS HAND TO HIS FAIR ANTAGONIST
HE MERELY OBSERVED TO THE COMTE IN HIS MELANCHOLY AND MELODIOUS VOICE YOU ARE EMBARKING IN A MOST DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE
HE IS IN GREAT DISTRESS OF MIND
AS SOON AS SHE HAD CAST A RAPID GLANCE OVER THIS FORTUNATE BREVET THE GOOD LADY CLASPED HER HANDS AN UNSPEAKABLE EXPRESSION OF ENVY AND DESPAIR CONTRACTED HER COUNTENANCE AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN TO AVOID FAINTING
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT AN EXPLANATION OF HER INDIFFERENCE FOR THE ONE IN THIS COMPASSION FOR THE OTHER SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE SAID LA VALLIERE SADLY
MADAME'S LEVITY OF MANNER HER SOMEWHAT BITTER JESTS,--BITTER FOR PERSONS OF A SENSITIVE DISPOSITION AND PARTICULARLY FOR ONE OF THE KING'S CHARACTER
FOUQUET THE KING'S SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES AND HAS RESOLVED TO USE ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO BRING ABOUT HIS FALL
BUT HAVING INQUIRED IN AN INDISCREET MANNER ABOUT IT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT THE HOST HAD GIVEN AS A REASON FOR THIS EXTREME VIGILANCE THAT AS THE TOWN WAS SO FULL OF WEALTHY NOBLEMEN IT MUST ALSO BE AS FULL OF CLEVER AND ZEALOUS PICKPOCKETS
D'ARTAGNAN HAD INSULTED HER
HE FELT ALMOST ON THE POINT OF FAINTING
DE GUICHE BECAUSE HE WISHES TO SECURE A LODGING FOR HIMSELF BEYOND THE PRECINCTS OF THE COURT IN THE EVENT OF HIS SUCCESS OR FAILURE AS THE CASE MIGHT BE
I IMAGINE I HAVE FOUND A FRIEND WHO IS NOTHING BUT A SPY
EVERY ONE OF COURSE REMARKED THIS OMISSION
DE GUICHE AT THE VERY MOMENT HE THUS ATTACKED MADAME'S CHARACTER MENTALLY ASKED HER FORGIVENESS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART
OF WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE THE KING JEALOUS AH SAID THE PRINCE THAT'S VERY PROPER DID YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS CONTINUED THE CHEVALIER SOLICIT DEAR DE GUICHE'S PARDON NO INDEED SAID MONSIEUR
I AM LISTENING PHILIP OPENED HIS MOUTH AS IF TO EXPRESS ALL THE TROUBLES HIS MIND WAS FILLED WITH AND WHICH HE SEEMED TO BE WAITING ONLY FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF DECLARING
ARAMIS WHO HAD BY GLANCING OVER THE GOVERNOR'S SHOULDER FOLLOWED THE PEN AS HE WROTE PUT THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT INTO HIS POCKET WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE READ IT WHICH MADE BAISEMEAUX PERFECTLY EASY
THE FORMER BECAUSE THEY SAID WITH MONTAIGNE HOW DO I KNOW AND THE LATTER WHO SAID WITH RABELAIS PERHAPS THE GREATEST NUMBER HAD FOLLOWED IN THE WAKE OF THE LATTER JUST AS IN HUNTING FIVE OR SIX OF THE BEST HOUNDS ALONE FOLLOW THE SCENT OF THE ANIMAL HUNTED WHILST THE REMAINDER OF THE PACK FOLLOW ONLY THE SCENT OF THE HOUNDS
YOU ARE INDEED A WORTHY SON OF THE MOST PERFECT GENTLEMAN THAT EVER LIVED
LA VALLIERE WAS EXHAUSTED WITH FATIGUE AND AURE AND ATHENAIS WERE OBLIGED TO SUPPORT HER
IT WAS INDEED MANICAMP HIMSELF
BUT SUPPOSING IT WERE TO EXIST ELSEWHERE I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU NOT TO SPEAK OF ABOUT IT REALLY THE KING LOUIS XIV.--YOU UNDERSTAND--WOULD BE EXCESSIVELY ANGRY WITH YOU IF HE WERE TO LEARN THAT YOU CONTRIBUTED IN ANY WAY TO SPREAD THE REPORT THAT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS HAS THE EFFRONTERY TO RESEMBLE HIM IT IS TRUE QUITE TRUE SAID BAISEMEAUX THOROUGHLY ALARMED
FOR IF YOU FORCE THE SALE YOU WILL LOSE A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS IF NECESSARY I WILL LOSE TWO HUNDRED
THE THREE MUSKETEERS SERIALIZED MARCH-JULY 1844
MY MOTHER SHALL KNOW NOTHING OF IT
I KNOW IT IS AND LIKE A PERFUME OF OTHER FAIRER DAYS HER YOUTH HER IMAGINATION AND HER HAPPINESS SEEMED TO BE WAFTED TOWARDS THE ECHO OF THIS INVOCATION
YOU SEEM AGITATED I
HAVING EXAMINED THE GREATER PART OF THE DRAWINGS WHICH WERE DISPLAYED FOR HIS INSPECTION ON EVERY SIDE HE GAVE HIS OPINION OR MADE HIS REMARKS UPON THEM AND IN THIS MANNER RENDERED SOME HAPPY AND OTHERS WRETCHED BY A SINGLE WORD
IN OUR COUNTRY WE SAY THE HIGHWAY BELONGS TO THE KING THEREFORE THIS SQUARE IS HIS MAJESTY'S
I DO NOT THINK YOU HAVE BEEN VERY BADLY OFF HITHERTO NO WELL THE FUTURE IS GUARANTEED BY THE PAST
I MEAN THAT I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE RESOLUTION I HAD FORMED TO WHAT RESOLUTION TO THAT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED TO YOUR MAJESTY WHEN ON THE VERY DAY WE HAD A CERTAIN EXPLANATION ABOUT MONSIEUR'S JEALOUSIES WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME THEN INQUIRED LOUIS WITH SOME ANXIETY
IN THAT WAY OF CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT M
ARAMIS WAS ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE LACKEY WHEN HE PAUSED
WHY HAVE YOU NOT ON THIS OCCASION BEEN MY FRIEND,--WHY HAVE YOU SHOWN SUSPICION OF ME MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE DID NOT ANSWER
ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN FULL DRESS BEAUTIFUL STILL FROM FORMER LOVELINESS AND FROM ALL THE RESOURCES COQUETRY CAN COMMAND AT THE HANDS OF CLEVER ASSISTANTS CONCEALED OR RATHER PRETENDED TO CONCEAL FROM THE CROWD OF COURTIERS WHO SURROUNDED HER AND WHO STILL ADMIRED HER THANKS TO THE COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WE HAVE INDICATED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE RAVAGES WHICH WERE ALREADY VISIBLE OF THE ACUTE SUFFERING TO WHICH SHE FINALLY YIELDED A FEW YEARS LATER
SHE WOULD SCORN TO TELL A FALSEHOOD YET WHEN IT IS IN HER INTEREST TO DO SO I AM AFRAID THAT THAT WOULD NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE IN HER IDEAS YES YES SAID MADAME
FORTHCOMING OUR NEXT ETEXT)--CHAPTERS 141-208 OF THE THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
BUT SERIOUSNESS IS NOT UNBECOMING IN PREACHERS AND THE MUSIC OF THE BALLET WOULD DROWN HALF MY ARGUMENTS
HE KNEW HE OWED THEM--ONE ESPECIALLY--A COMPENSATION FOR HIS LONG ABSENCE
BUT IN ANY CASE LISTEN ATHENAIS
IT IS A MATTER OF COURSE
SO TRIFLING AN AMOUNT AS THAT
DE WARDES ON SHORE
BUT THOUGH A QUEEN SHE IS STILL A WOMAN AND HER HEART LIKE THAT OF THE REST OF HER SEX CANNOT CLOSE ITSELF AGAINST THE SUSPICIONS WHICH SUCH AS ARE EVILLY DISPOSED INSINUATE
HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES AT THE VERY LEAST
BUT THE COINCIDENCE OF MY DREAM ABOUT THIS MATTER WITH MY OWN IDEAS IS EXTRAORDINARY
BUT M
AS HOWEVER HE WAS DEPARTING THE FRANCISCAN MURMURED TO HIMSELF
SHE WAS WRITING WE HAVE SAID WHEN MONSIEUR ENTERED HER ORATORY NOT WITH RED EYES OR PALE CHEEKS BUT RESTLESS OUT OF TEMPER AND ANNOYED
DE BRAGELONNE LOVES LA VALLIERE TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IF SHE DECEIVED HIM HE WOULD I REPEAT EITHER KILL HIMSELF OR KILL HER BUT THE KING IS THERE TO DEFEND HER SAID MONTALAIS
YOU WILL LEAVE THIS HOTEL CARDINAL IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND A REPLY SHALL BE SENT YOU THE CARDINAL WITHDREW
MADAME BEGGED THE ORATOR TO CONTINUE
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE SHE SAID SIGHING
YOU HEARD SIRE MURMURED ATHENAIS
WHAT IS THE BRIDE'S NAME MADEMOISELLE DE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE SAID ATHOS COLDLY
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT NO ONE COMMANDS IN THIS MATTER BUT MYSELF
DO YOU REMARK HOW CURIOUSLY IT DANCES UPON THE CRESTS OF THE WAVES
THE STYLE OF THEIR MANTLES THEIR GRACEFUL FIGURES A MYSTERIOUS YET HAUGHTY CARRIAGE WHICH DISTINGUISHED THEM BOTH ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO WALKED FIRST STRUCK THE CHEVALIER
I AM A JESUIT OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR MONSIEUR GRISART THE PHYSICIAN STARTED FOR IN FACT A JESUIT OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD BEEN INITIATED IN ALL THE SECRETS OF THE ORDER ONE OF THOSE FOR WHOM SCIENCE HAS NO MORE SECRETS THE SOCIETY NO FURTHER BARRIERS TO PRESENT--TEMPORAL OBEDIENCE NO MORE TRAMMELS
I FONDLY THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME SAID RAOUL WHOSE VOICE BECAME MORE AND MORE AGITATED
BUT THERE ARE A HUNDRED HOUSES AT LE HAVRE YES AND ALL THE HUNDRED ARE LET IMPOSSIBLE WHAT AN OBSTINATE FELLOW YOU ARE
IN THAT CASE MAKE YOURSELF EASY
THE DUKE HAS ALREADY INFORMED ME THAT HE WISHES TO SPEAK TO ME
THIS DRYAD MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT WITH THE GODDESS MNEMOSYNE THESE SHEPHERDESSES MADAME
YOU WILL BE THE BEARER OF THEM I BOWED
BUT AS YET HE HAD NOT DECLARED HIMSELF
THE DAUGHTER OF THE MARQUIS DE LA VALLIERE AND STEP-DAUGHTER OF THAT GOOD M
DE BRAGELONNE PERHAPS SHE DOES SAID MONTALAIS
AND HAVING REACHED MY HOTEL QUITE OUT OF BREATH I PERCEIVED A LITTER UPON WHICH FOUR PEASANTS WERE CARRYING A SICK MONK A MONK YES AN OLD GRAY-BEARDED FRANCISCAN
BUT YOU WERE NOT THE LESS THE CAUSE OF THAT LADY'S DISGRACE
D'ARTAGNAN RETURNS TO PARIS TO LIVE THE LIFE OF A RICH CITIZEN AND ATHOS AFTER NEGOTIATING THE MARRIAGE OF PHILIP THE KING'S BROTHER TO PRINCESS HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND LIKEWISE RETIRES TO HIS OWN ESTATE LA FERE
FOUQUET SO EAGER TO SEEK THE SOURCE OF A FAVOR SO VERY RECENT AND THEN ADDED ALOUD YOUR FRIENDSHIP MONSIEUR
THE KING DID SO LIKEWISE STILL HOLDING HER HAND ALL THE WHILE
IT IS HE WHO PRESUMES TO RESEMBLE THE YES YES SAID ARAMIS
FOR IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD ALREADY HEARD IT PRONOUNCED BEFORE BUT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER ON WHAT OCCASION
EXTERNAL PEACE ASSURED
BUT TO-DAY AS IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF DANCING TO MUSIC I DANCE AND YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT SAID THE PRINCE COLDLY
HE CLASPED HIS SWORD FIRMLY IN HIS HAND AND AWAITED THE ENCOUNTER
QUICK QUICK FETCH A SURGEON BUT HOWEVER GREAT THE ANXIETY WITH WHICH THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS MAY HAVE SEEMED TO OTHERS HE HAD NOT SO CAREFULLY SCHOOLED HIMSELF BUT THAT THEY APPEARED AS WELL AS THE GESTURE WHICH ACCOMPANIED THEM SOMEWHAT COLD TO SAINT-AIGNAN TO WHOM THE KING HAD CONFIDED THE SUDDEN LOVE WITH WHICH SHE HAD INSPIRED HIM
GOOD-EVENING MANICAMP SAID THE COMTE I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU MY DEAR FELLOW
ABOUT THAT TIME IS THE KING AWARE OF IT WHY THAT IS THE VERY THING WHICH CONSTITUTES THE PERFECT ROMANCE OF THE AFFAIR FOR THE KING WAS BEHIND THE ROYAL OAK WITH SAINT-AIGNAN AND HEARD THE WHOLE OF THE INTERESTING CONVERSATION WITHOUT LOSING A SINGLE WORD OF IT MADAME FELT STRUCK TO THE HEART SAYING INCAUTIOUSLY BUT I HAVE SEEN THE KING SINCE AND HE NEVER TOLD ME A WORD ABOUT IT OF COURSE SAID MONSIEUR
WHO ARE THESE YOUNG LADIES LOVERS MONTALAIS'S LOVER SAID THE CHEVALIER
BOTH REPLIED THAT THEY ONLY AWAITED HIS ORDERS AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS READY TO BEGIN BUT THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE SURE OF FINE WEATHER AND A FAVORABLE NIGHT BEFORE THESE ORDERS COULD BE CARRIED OUT
FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS I DO NOT INTEND TO ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING I WILL AVAIL MYSELF OF THE INTERVAL TO AMASS FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS WHICH WILL BE SERVICEABLE AS MONEY IN HAND IN CASE OF WAR FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS FOR THE EXPENSES OF YOUR MAJESTY'S HOUSEHOLD ONLY BE IT UNDERSTOOD YOU THINK WAR PROBABLE M
HE WAS THE SON OF A SYNDIC OF THE CITY OF WHOM M
BUT BY THE BY WHAT YOU DO NOT SPEAK OF THE RESEMBLANCE I DO NOT SPEAK OF IT DEAR M
AT TWENTY SOUS THE POST SEVEN LIVRES
BUT HOW TELL ME I SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING AS FAR AS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S APARTMENT
AND SHE HAS JUST GIVEN DIRECTIONS IN CONSEQUENCE CONTINUED THE CHEVALIER
HE IS NOT AMBITIOUS OF DISPLAY BUT HE IS AMBITIOUS OF BEING LOVED
ALL ITS MEMBERS WERE STANDING THE KING ALONE BEING SEATED
THE RUBY NECKLACE SHE SAID
PROFOUNDLY GRATIFIED AMBITION FLOWED WITH LIFE-BLOOD TOWARDS HIS HEART
HE SEIZED RAOUL'S HAND HIS FACE WHICH HAD BEEN AS COLD AS ICE SEEMED ON FIRE
EXPLAIN WHAT YOU REALLY REQUIRE MONSIEUR SHE SAID
IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO SEE EACH OTHER SINCE THEY CAN WRITE THE MARQUISE TREMBLED FOR THIS PAPER WAS THE ENVELOPE OF THE LETTER SHE WAS READING AS HER FRIEND HAD ENTERED AND WAS SEALED WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ARMS
DE BRAGELONNE I HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY WELL INFORMED ON THE CONTRARY MONSIEUR REPLIED RAOUL AND THE ADVICE I GIVE DE GUICHE IS THAT OF A FRIEND DURING THIS DISCUSSION DE GUICHE SOMEWHAT SHAKEN LOOKED ALTERNATELY FIRST AT ONE AND THEN AT THE OTHER OF HIS ADVISERS
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT AT THE CONVENT WHEN WE WERE SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS IN ARITHMETIC--AH
BUT EVEN AS SHE IS AT PRESENT MADAME IS VERY PRETTY AND CONSEQUENTLY OTHERS HAVE REMARKED IT UNDOUBTEDLY FOR A WOMAN OF ORDINARY RANK IS NOTICED--AND WITH STILL GREATER REASON A PRINCESS SHE HAS BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP I SUPPOSE MADAME HENRIETTE HER MOTHER IS A WOMAN SOMEWHAT COLD IN MANNER SLIGHTLY PRETENTIOUS BUT FULL OF NOBLE THOUGHTS
THE PREVIOUS NIGHT IN FACT FERTILE IN MELANCHOLY IDEAS HAD SHARPENED HIS FEATURES GENERALLY SO NOBLE IN THEIR INDIFFERENCE OF EXPRESSION AND HAD TRACED DARK LINES OF ANXIETY AROUND HIS EYES
BESIDES REMEMBER THIS
MONSIEUR HE SAID TO HIM WITH CIVILITY YOUR APARTMENT IS READY FOR YOU AND THE STABLES TOO ONLY HE LOOKED ROUND HIM AND INQUIRED YOUR HORSES MY HORSES MAY OR MAY NOT ARRIVE
I WILL CONCEAL MYSELF IN THE THICKET AND IF I CAN HEAR YOU I WILL TELL YOU SO YES MADAME IF THEREFORE YOU REALLY SPOKE LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE KING TO HAVE HEARD YOU IN THAT CASE ATHENAIS SEEMED TO AWAIT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SENTENCE WITH SOME ANXIETY
GIVE ME YOUR ARM COMTE SHE SAID AND LET US RETURN AH
AT ONCE ALL WAS OVER
THAT IS WELL SAID DE GUICHE REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE RAOUL AND TELL THEM TO SHOW YOU THE TWO HORSES I HAVE JUST PURCHASED
LOUIS IMAGINED THIS ATTITUDE AND AGITATION TO BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF A TERROR ONLY PARTIALLY REASSURED
MADAME PARTICULARLY WAS DELIGHTFUL
DE WARDES IN CONCLUSION
FOUQUET HARDLY MOVED HIS HEAD
I KNOW MANICAMP IS CAPABLE OF KILLING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO COMMIT THE CRIME YOU HAVE TO REPROACH YOURSELF WITH BUT I WILL REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED
ADMIRABLE HE THOUGHT STRIKING HIS HANDS TOGETHER THIS IS MY PROVIDENTIAL MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AND HE STARTED OUT PRECIPITATELY ALONG THE STAIRCASE HOPING TO REACH THE COURTYARD IN TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE WOMAN IN THE MANTLE AND HER COMPANION
I NEEDED SOME REAL DANGER AND SOME MORTAL RISK TO RUN TO TRANQUILIZE ME IN THAT CASE I THINK YOU HAVE MET WITH WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
THEY WERE REASSURED HOWEVER WHEN THEY SAW THAT D'ARTAGNAN MANIFESTED NO EMOTION WHATEVER
NAMELY THAT THE COMTE SHOULD BE INDISCREET
YOU LOVE MADAME--AND WHO INDEED WOULD NOT LOVE HER
I HAVE ANOTHER WHAT IS IT MADAME IS ANGRY WITH YOU AND SHE HAS REASON TO BE SO
I DO NOT YIELD MYSELF IN THIS MANNER WE WILL NOT SPEAK OF IT ANY MORE THEN
THESE TENTS HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED DURING THE NIGHT-TIME
THE RICHEST HANGINGS AND THE THICKEST CARPETS GLISTENING FLAGSTONES AND PICTURES WITH THEIR RICHLY GILDED FRAMES
VERY WELL I SHALL SAY
THEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HAVING RECOGNIZED THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HE MADE A FEW CIVIL REMARKS TO WHICH THE CHEVALIER WAS OBLIGED TO REPLY
THIS WAS A QUESTION SHE HERSELF COULD HARDLY ANSWER
BAISEMEAUX DID SO TOOK THE KEYS AND HIMSELF OPENED THE DOOR OF THE THIRD ROOM
BESIDES THE OBJECT IS TO PREVENT ANY VIOLENT MEASURES ON MY BROTHER'S PART SO THAT A LITTLE PRECIPITATION MAY BE ADVISABLE
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED MADAME SAID TO HIM CONFESS NOW THAT IS HIS ALL A CHARMING INVENTION INVENTION NO
WHY HAD LOUIS FORMERLY DISDAINED ALMOST HATED MADAME
BUT IF FORTUNE WILL NOT GET ME OUT OF MY DIFFICULTY--WELL I WILL TEACH FORTUNE A LESSON--AND I KNOW VERY WELL TO WHOM I INTEND TO OFFER THE BRACELETS THESE WORDS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SO EXPRESSIVE A SMILE THAT MADAME COULD NOT RESIST PAYING HER BY A GRATEFUL KISS
SUSPICIONS OF TREASONABLE PLOTS AND PRACTICES AND THE PROOFS THERE ARE NONE VERY WELL
JEALOUS EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE
TELL ME THE TRUTH THEN
YES YOU MAY CALL IT INSTINCT IF YOU PLEASE KEENEST SENSIBILITY EXQUISITE REFINEMENT OF FEELING PERPETUAL PLAY OF RESTRAINED OUTBREAKS OF AFFECTION WHICH END IN SMOKE
AND ON CALLING ME NEARER TO YOU I DO NOT CHANGE MY MASTER I ONLY CHANGE MY GARRISON RAOUL WAS SILENT AND BOWED
BUT WHO WILL THAT BE
HE MUTTERED SOME IMPERTINENT REMARK OR ANOTHER WELL WHAT IS YOUR OPINION PHILIP THAT I HAVE BEEN MADE A FOOL OF
WHATEVER YOU LIKE
THESE WALKS WERE COVERED WITH MOSS OR WITH LEAVES THAT FORMED A CARPET FROM THE LOOM OF NATURE
WELL MONSEIGNEUR DO YOU SEE ANYTHING TO OBJECT TO IN THIS REASONING
CONFESS AS IF IT WERE SIMPLY A QUESTION ABOUT MADEMOISELLE DE CHALAIS OR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE THEN BREAKING OFF HE SAID BEGINNING TO LAUGH AGAIN COMTE THAT WASN'T AT ALL BAD!--A REMARK LIKE A SWORD WHICH CUTS TWO WAYS AT ONCE
AND UPON EVERY REPRESENTATIVE OF THESE RACES THE KING BESTOWED A DIAMOND OR SOME OTHER ARTICLE OF VALUE
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IS IN PARIS AS ONE OF MADAME'S MAIDS OF HONOR
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I HARDLY KNOW STILL WHAT IS YOUR OPINION SIRE THE YOUNG LADY MUST HAVE HEARD THE MUTTERING OF THE THUNDER AND HAS GOT FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED AT WHAT ASKED LOUIS WITH DIGNITY
HE FOUND A LARGE ASSEMBLAGE OF PEOPLE THERE LAUGHING AND WHISPERING IN EVERY PART OF THE ROOM
BESIDES LET ME ASK SIRE WHO EXCEPT YOURSELF HAS EVER THOUGHT OF PITYING JEALOUS PEOPLE
MONSIEUR REPLIED IN THE RETICENT TONE OF VOICE HE GENERALLY ADOPTED WITH HIS BROTHER THAT HE COULD NOT VERY WELL UNDERSTAND THE SUSCEPTIBILITIES OF A WOMAN WHOSE CONDUCT MIGHT IN HIS OPINION EXPOSE HER TO CENSORIOUS REMARKS AND THAT IF ANY ONE HAD A RIGHT TO FEEL WOUNDED IT WAS HE MONSIEUR HIMSELF
MONSIEUR WHO HAD REGAINED HIS COMPOSURE WENT TRIUMPHANTLY TO LOOK AFTER HIS WIFE AND IT WAS NOT YET MIDNIGHT AND THE FETE WAS TO CONTINUE UNTIL TWO IN THE MORNING HE OFFERED HER HIS HAND FOR A PROMENADE
OH OH HE SAID A DANGEROUS FEVER WHAT DO YOU CALL A DANGEROUS FEVER INQUIRED THE FRANCISCAN WITH AN IMPERIOUS LOOK
YOU UNDERSTAND I TRUST THAT A QUATRAIN IS A SERIOUS AFFAIR OF COURSE AND AS OF THESE FOUR LINES OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED I HAVE YET THREE AND A HALF TO MAKE I NEED MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION I QUITE UNDERSTAND
HE BEGAN TO FEEL NERVOUS
THE KING RAOUL IS WELL INTENTIONED TOWARDS US BOTH
WHILST ALONE I SHOULD HAVE THE APPEARANCE EITHER OF A LOVER OR A ROBBER
THIS PASSAGE LED TO THE DRAWBRIDGE OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE REAL ENTRANCE
MAZARIN GRANT YOU THIS PRETENDED FAVOR
BUT BEFORE HAVING BEEN MET BY RAOUL DE GUICHE HAD MET MANICAMP WHO HAD MET MALICORNE
BUT DO NOT GET ANGRY
A PAIN IN MY SIDE
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT VANITY APART I STAND WELL WITH HIS MAJESTY SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT I ENTREAT YOU MONSIEUR PURSUED RAOUL NOT TO MAINTAIN TOWARDS ME YOUR PRESENT GRAVE AND SERIOUS MANNER
I HAVE SATISFIED MYSELF THEREFORE WITH THE SINCEREST PLEASURE THAT YOUR APPREHENSIONS HAVE NO FOUNDATION AND CONTINUED MONSIEUR IN AN INTERROGATIVE TONE OF VOICE AND FIXING HIS EYES UPON HIS BROTHER WHAT YOUR MAJESTY HAS DISCOVERED FOR MADAME AND I BOW MYSELF TO YOUR SUPERIOR JUDGMENT--HAVE YOU VERIFIED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE SCANDAL OF WHICH I COMPLAIN YOU ARE RIGHT PHILIP SAID THE KING
I HAVE SUFFERED SO MUCH DEATH ITSELF WOULD BE A BOON
NO MORE FIRE NO MORE POCKET-MONEY NO MORE WALKING-MONEY NOTHING BUT SLEEP TO TAKE THE PLACE OF REPASTS COMPANIES AND BALLS
THOSE WHO LOVE OR WHO ARE BELOVED WILL UNDERSTAND HIS ANXIETY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HIS HAPPINESS IN THE NEXT
AND YOU ALONE HAVE SPOKEN WORDS OF WISDOM CERTAINLY I DO NOT DISPUTE IT REPLIED ATHENAIS
KING CHARLES AWAITS YOUR RETURN
HE HAS GIGANTIC IDEAS A STRONG WILL AND DISCRETION
THE COUNT REMARKING THE WOE-BEGONE EXPRESSION OF MANICAMP'S FACE COULD NOT RESIST LAUGHING
I HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY
AT THIS EPOCH THE FASHION OF INGENIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED CONVERSATIONS AND HAZARDOUSLY DANGEROUS RECITALS SO PREVAILED THAT WHERE IN MODERN TIMES A WHOLE COMPANY ASSEMBLED IN A DRAWING-ROOM WOULD BEGIN TO SUSPECT SOME SCANDAL OR DISCLOSURE OR TRAGIC EVENT AND WOULD HURRY AWAY IN DISMAY MADAME'S GUESTS QUIETLY SETTLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR PLACES IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE A WORD OR GESTURE OF THE COMEDY COMPOSED BY MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN FOR THEIR BENEFIT AND THE TERMINATION OF WHICH WHATEVER THE STYLE AND THE PLOT MIGHT BE MUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE BE MARKED BY THE MOST PERFECT PROPRIETY
MY CASH-BOX MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SAID FOUQUET COLDLY
THEREUPON LA VALLIERE IN AN ABRUPT AND A BROKEN VOICE HER EYES DRIED UP BY THE FIRE OF HER TEARS MADE A STEP TOWARDS THE KING AND SAID DID YOUR MAJESTY HEAR EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WHAT EVERYTHING I SAID BENEATH THE ROYAL OAK I DID NOT LOSE A SYLLABLE AND NOW AFTER YOUR MAJESTY REALLY HEARD ALL ARE YOU ABLE TO THINK I ABUSED YOUR CREDIBILITY CREDULITY
BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO SET OFF SAID BRAGELONNE LOOKING AT LOUISE
SHALL WE MAKE AN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY AN ALLIANCE WITH YOU SIRE WHY NOT
NOW OR NEVER IS THE TIME TO LISTEN AND NOT LOSE A SYLLABLE OF WHAT THEY MAY HAVE TO SAY TO EACH OTHER REPLIED ARAMIS IN FOUQUET'S EAR
THAT IS TO SAY THAT IN THOSE TIMES OF EASY MORALS HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF BY FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF HIS FATHER AND LENDING AT HIGH INTEREST FOR SHORT TERMS A REVENUE OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED LIVRES WITHOUT RECKONING SIX HUNDRED LIVRES FURNISHED BY THE GENEROSITY OF THE SYNDIC
COLBERT HIMSELF
DE MALICORNE WILL HAVE NO OCCASION TO GET OUT OF TEMPER
NO DEW HAD FALLEN IN THE MORNING
MAKE YOURSELF LOOK AS BEAUTIFUL AS POSSIBLE THAT OUR SUPPER MAY BE VERY BRILLIANT
FOUQUET'S FATE DEEPLY AFFECTS ME AND BECAUSE HE IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST UNFORTUNATE MEN LIVING AH SAID THE MARQUISE PLACING HER HAND UPON HER HEART SOMETHING NEW THEN HAS OCCURRED DO YOU NOT KNOW IT I AM UTTERLY IGNORANT OF EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE WITH THE POIGNANT ANGUISH THAT SUSPENDS THOUGHT AND SPEECH AND EVEN LIFE ITSELF
I ONLY WISHED TO ASK HIM FOR YOUR ADDRESS TO ASK M
I CAN ASSIGN AS A PRETEXT THAT I WISH IT REMODELED ON PATTERS MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY OWN TASTE
HE IS AN EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHED MAN
I SHOULD BLUSH TOO MUCH IF YOU WERE MY CONFESSOR AND FOUQUET BEGAN TO SIGH
AGE HAS HOWEVER MADE ME MORE REASONABLE AND ABOVE ALL MORE UPRIGHT
WITH THE NEW RANK OF INTENDANT BESTOWED ON HIM BY LOUIS COLBERT SUCCEEDS IN HAVING TWO OF FOUQUET'S LOYAL FRIENDS TRIED AND EXECUTED
PRAY THINK OF THAT
FOUQUET HAS FURNISHED SIX MILLIONS
SIRE AND SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING
I HAVE NO CURIOSITY
AT LEAST I HAVE NOT
THE YOUNG GIRL UTTERED A DEEP GROAN STRIKING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN DESPAIR
I LIKE A COURT SO DISTINGUISHED BY ITS REFINEMENT AND COURTESY
IT IS ONLY M
ONE WOULD FANCY FRANCE WAS YOUR NATIVE COUNTRY MADAME THE COUNTRY OF THOSE WHO LOVE IS THE COUNTRY OF THOSE WHOM THEY LOVE NOT ANOTHER WORD MY LORD
IF WE HAD HUNTED FOR LOVERS INSTEAD OF BUTTERFLIES YOU CAN SEE FROM THOSE WHO SURROUND HER WHAT SUCCESSFUL SPORT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD TELL ME HENRIETTA WHAT WOULD BE SAID IF THE KING WERE TO MAKE HIMSELF ONE OF THOSE LOVERS AND LET HIS GLANCE FALL IN THAT DIRECTION
THEN A MOMENT AFTER SHE ADDED IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME IN THE PRESENCE OF A MAN BUT A FOURTH PART OF WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID OR EVEN IF I WERE ASSURED THAT YOU THINK IT I SHOULD DIE OF SHAME AND GRIEF WHERE I AM NOW VERY WELL
ALL THE INSIGNIFICANT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE POOR AND GREEDY OF GAIN
WHY DID YOU RETURN SO LATE AND WHENCE ARE THESE MEASURES OF STRICT SUPERVISION WHICH HAVE BEEN ADOPTED SINCE THIS MORNING WITH RESPECT TO US BOTH MY DEAR LOUISE YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION BY ANOTHER OR RATHER BY TEN OTHERS WHICH IS NOT ANSWERING ME AT ALL
THE PRINCESS IN THE MIDST OF HER ELATION OF SPIRITS DIVIDED HER ATTENTION BETWEEN THE KING WHO WAS PLAYING WITH HER MONSIEUR WHO QUIETLY JOKED HER ABOUT HER ENORMOUS WINNINGS AND DE GUICHE WHO EXHIBITED AN EXTRAVAGANT DELIGHT
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE FIRST AT THE RENDEZVOUS I HAVE BEEN HERE THIS QUARTER OF AN HOUR REPLIED LA VALLIERE
WE WILL ASSIGN AS A REASON FOR HIS DEPARTURE THAT HE FEELS HURT AND INJURED--NOTHING WILL BE EASIER
THE KING YOU ARGUE FOLLOWS ME LISTENS TO ME WATCHES ME
AND SHE LEANED AGAINST A TREE
YOU SEEM TO THINK EVERYTHING BAD DEAR HENRIETTA SAID LOUIS DISCONTENTEDLY
FOUQUET YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD NOT DO FOR ME TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CONVERSATION AH AH IS M
THE USUAL HOUR FOR THE REPAST WAS FIVE O'CLOCK
COLBERT RETURNED THE CHEVALIER
I AM LESS LOVING PERHAPS
DE BAISEMEAUX CAN CLAIM MORE IF THE FIFTEEN FRANCS BE NOT SUFFICIENT AH SAID BAISEMEAUX NOW I THINK OF IT I SHALL CLAIM IT ARAMIS SHUT THE BOOK
D'ARTAGNAN THEN CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH BOWING TO FOUQUET AND ENTERED
MAY I DEPEND THEN UPON THE FIVE THOUSAND PISTOLES TO-MORROW DO YOU WANT THEM THIS EVENING IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR I WISH TO START EARLY
BUT IF NOT PERMIT ME TO THINK THAT THE STORM IS A STORM SIMPLY AND NOTHING MORE AND THE KING AT THE SAME MOMENT RAISED HIS HEAD AS IF TO INTERROGATE THE HEAVENS
HE IS HANDSOME I BELIEVE YES
ONE THING THAT MAY BE CAUSING CONFUSION IS THAT THE ETEXT WE HAVE NOW ENTITLED TEN YEARS LATER SAYS IT'S THE SEQUEL TO THE THREE MUSKETEERS
INTIMATELY MONSEIGNEUR
LET US GO TO THE CHATEAU FIRST WHAT FOR WHY TO TAKE MY WIFE OF COURSE WHAT FOR ASKED DE GUICHE
BUT I APPEAL TO YOU GENTLEMEN
SAY NOTHING OF IT TO YOUR WIFE
AND THEN IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THOSE HOUSES FORMING THE GROUNDWORK OF THE PICTURE AND APPEARING AN ALMOST IMPASSABLE BARRIER A LINE OF THICK TREES THE ADVANCED SENTINELS OF THE VAST FOREST WHICH EXTENDS IN FRONT OF FONTAINEBLEAU
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
CHAPTER L
THE NYMPHS OF THE PARK OF FONTAINEBLEAU
BUT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT WELL I APPEAL TO HIS HIGHNESS NO DOUBT OF IT SAID MONSIEUR
THAT IN THE FIRST CASE LA VALLIERE MUST RETURN IT TO YOU OR SATISFY YOU BY BURNING IT IN YOUR PRESENCE
BUT AT THAT INSTANT A STEP RESOUNDED ON THE STAIRCASE
WELL THEN I PASSED THAT WAY SHE SAID AND AS I FOUND BENEATH MY STEPS MANY FRESH FLOWERS NEWLY BLOWN NO DOUBT PHYLLIS AMARYLLIS GALATEA AND ALL YOUR SHEPHERDESSES HAD PASSED THE SAME WAY BEFORE ME THE KING BIT HIS LIPS FOR THE RECITAL WAS BECOMING MORE AND MORE THREATENING
AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IN THAT KISS HE POURED OUT HIS WHOLE HEART
MONTALAIS FOLLOWED THEM WITH HER EYES AS LONG AS SHE COULD PERCEIVE THEM
DE GUICHE DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU MADAME BUT TO ME
ON THE CONTRARY IT IS VERY PRESSING VERY WELL WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY BY AND BY WILL NOT DO FOR MY MONEY IS THERE RETURNED THE MARQUISE POINTING OUT THE COFFER TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND SHOWING HIM AS SHE OPENED IT THE BUNDLES OF NOTES AND HEAPS OF GOLD
THE KING WHO WAS IN ADVANCE OF HIS COMPANION LEAPED ACROSS THE DITCH AND REACHED THE GROUP AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN FROM THE END OF THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE CHATEAU A DOZEN PERSONS WERE APPROACHING WHO HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE SPOT BY THE SAME CRIES THAT HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE KING AND M
HIS MAJESTY HAD PASSED A PORTION OF THE MORNING IN LOOKING OVER WITH MADAME AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT VARIOUS GOODS OF LYONS MANUFACTURE OF WHICH HE HAD MADE HIS SISTER-IN-LAW A PRESENT
HERE IT IS RETURNED THE CARDINAL
I AM YOUR FRIEND AND ASSIGN YOU NO ONE THAT MAY BE
THE FLOW OF THE TIDE HAD BORNE THE DUKE'S AND DE WARDES'S CLOTHES TO THE SHORE AND DE WARDES WAS WRAPPED IN THE DUKE'S DOUBLET UNDER THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS HIS OWN WHEN THE FISHERMEN CARRIED HIM IN THEIR ARMS TOWARDS THE TOWN
MERELY A JEST MORE OR LESS AMUSING AND NOTHING MORE OH MURMURED THE YOUNG GIRL THE KING DOES NOT AND WILL NOT BELIEVE ME THEN NO INDEED I WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU SAID THE KING
THE BARON DREW BACK IN SURPRISE
LOUIS THEREFORE CHANGED HIS MANEUVERS
IF SHE TRIED TO BRING HIM BACK BY COQUETRY MALICORNE PLAYED THE COQUETTE BETTER THAN SHE COULD
THERE THERE NOW
FOR THE LOVELY GABRIELLE D'ESTREES
A FEW PACES FROM THEM A THIRD STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH WAS CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE
AND WHAT DO YOU BRING ME A LETTER MONSIEUR LE COMTE MALICORNE HANDED HIM THE FIRST DOCUMENT AND NARROWLY WATCHED THE COUNT'S FACE WHO AS HE READ IT BEGAN TO LAUGH
IT IS THE YEAR 1660 AND D'ARTAGNAN AFTER THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF LOYAL SERVICE HAS BECOME DISGUSTED WITH SERVING KING LOUIS XIV WHILE THE REAL POWER RESIDES WITH THE CARDINAL MAZARIN AND HAS TENDERED HIS RESIGNATION
AND WHAT YOU PURCHASE YOU DO NOT PART WITH WHAT COULD THESE EMERALDS BE SOLD FOR THEN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS THE MARQUISE WROTE DOWN UPON HER TABLETS THE AMOUNT WHICH THE JEWELER MENTIONED
THE DIFFERENT NOBLEMEN AND LADIES OF THE COURT THEREUPON DEFILED BEFORE THE KING ONE AFTER THE OTHER IN ORDER TO THANK HIS MAJESTY FOR THE GREAT HONOR WHICH HAD BEEN CONFERRED UPON THEM BY THE INVITATION
NAY MORE THAN THAT WHEN YOU HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IT IS THE PERSON WHOM HE EXPECTED ON THE FIRST OF JUNE I AM CONVINCED HE WILL HASTEN HERE HIMSELF THE OFFICER COULD NOT POSSIBLY BELIEVE THAT A MAN OF THE GOVERNOR'S IMPORTANCE SHOULD PUT HIMSELF OUT FOR A PERSON OF SO LITTLE IMPORTANCE AS THE CITIZEN-LOOKING VISITOR ON HORSEBACK
THE DOOR MOVED UPON INVISIBLE HINGES AND FOUQUET APPEARED
ARE YOU TOO SAID THE KING ALMOST IN A TONE OF REPROACH ARE YOU AMONG THOSE WHO THINK THE SISTER HAS A RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS OF THE BROTHER IT IS NOT FOR ME SIRE TO SEEK TO PENETRATE YOUR MAJESTY'S SECRETS YOU DO BELIEVE IT THEN EXCLAIMED THE KING
AS THE MAJORITY WAS ALREADY INFORMED AND WELL INFORMED TOO ON THE MATTER THE ACKNOWLEDGED FAVOR WITH WHICH SHE WAS REGARDED HAD ATTRACTED TO HER SIDE SOME OF THE MOST ASTUTE AS WELL AS THE LEAST SENSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE COURT
DO NOT STRIP ME OF EVERYTHING MADAME FELT THE REPROACH AND THE LESSON AND THE COLOR RUSHED TO HER FACE
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND IN HIS GOODNESS OF HEART AND IN HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE VIGOR OF BODY ENOUGH PRESENCE OF MIND TO REMEMBER THE KIND RECEPTION OF THIS MAN
COME IS NOT THAT YOUR OPINION YES
AMYNTAS'S PLACE TOO IS AT THE FEET OF TYRCIS
SHE HAS A NOBLE APPEARANCE YES BUT HER FACE IS THIN I THOUGHT HER TEETH BEAUTIFUL THEY CAN EASILY BE SEEN FOR HER MOUTH IS LARGE ENOUGH
WHY MONSEIGNEUR I HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT TO MY COST
THE FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PROFUSE WITH IT DURING THE LAST MONTH I HAVE MORE NOT ONLY FOR ALL YOUR MAJESTY'S REQUIREMENTS BUT FOR ALL YOUR CAPRICES I THANK YOU MONSIEUR FOUQUET REPLIED THE KING SERIOUSLY
DE BRAGELONNE MARRY HIM
DON'T YOU KNOW HIM NO COME COME DO NOT AFFECT A VIRTUE MORE EXTRAVAGANTLY EXCESSIVE THAN OUR VANITY!--YOU HAVE EYES I SUPPOSE EXCELLENT THEN YOU MUST HAVE SEEN ALL THOSE WHO DANCED THIS EVENING YES NEARLY ALL THAT IS A VERY IMPERTINENT NEARLY ALL FOR SOMEBODY YOU MUST TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH VERY WELL
DE LORRAINE THE MATTER IS VERY SIMPLE HE IS JEALOUS OF YOU BAH
NO SIRE REPLIED FOUQUET BUT I AM SURE FOR SOMETHING AGREEABLE IF I AM TO JUDGE FROM YOUR MAJESTY'S GRACIOUS SMILE YOU ARE MISTAKEN THEN I SIRE FOR I SUMMONED YOU ON THE CONTRARY TO PICK A QUARREL WITH YOU WITH ME SIRE YES
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WERE THE QUEENS THEN MADAME AND A FEW LADIES OF THE COURT WHO HAD BEEN CAREFULLY SELECTED
IT IS UNQUESTIONABLE THAT DE GUICHE HAD NEVER LOOKED SO HANDSOME FOR MADAME'S GLANCE HAD ITS CUSTOMARY EFFECT OF LIGHTING UP THE FEATURES OF THE SON OF THE MARSHAL DE GRAMONT
WE CANNOT TALK LONG IN THIS MANNER WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED THAT IS VERY PROBABLE SAID THE MAN IN THE CALMEST AND COOLEST OF TONES
IN OTHER WORDS TO TROUBLE HIM IN HIS HAPPINESS--A HAPPINESS OF WHICH SAINT-AIGNAN WAS QUITE IGNORANT
MALICORNE LEFT ALONE REASONED WITH HIMSELF IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
THE DOOR OPENED AND ARAMIS ENTERED
THE DUKE OF NORFOLK A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN FROM TWENTY-SIX TO TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ADVANCED TO MEET THEM
A YOUNG FAIR-COMPLEXIONED GIRL FROM TWENTY TO ONE-AND-TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WHOSE LARGE BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE OPENED THEM IN THE MOST DAZZLING MANNER WALKED AT THE HEAD OF THE BAND AND WAS THE FIRST PRESENTED
AS FOR MONSIEUR HE HAD NOT EVEN THE SATISFACTION OF WITNESSING MADAME'S ABDICATION OF HER ROYALTY IN THE EVENING FOR SHE LIVED IN THE ROYAL PAVILION WITH THE YOUNG QUEEN AND THE QUEEN-MOTHER
THE CARDINAL'S NAME WAS MONSEIGNEUR HERREBIA.--A RICH MERCHANT OF BREMEN WITH HIS MAN-SERVANT AND TWO HORSES
DE BRAGELONNE FOR INSTANCE I KNOW THE NAME WITHOUT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH THE PERSON TO WHOM IT BELONGS
ALL THE OFFICERS ARE GAINED OVER
DE GUICHE WHO WITH HIS ARMS RAISED AND HIS EYES HALF CLOSED WAS KNEELING ON ONE KNEE LIKE THE SPANISH DANCERS WITH LOOKS FULL OF PASSION AND GESTURES OF THE MOST CARESSING CHARACTER
NAY FEAR NOTHING HE SAID WITH A RISING EMOTION WHICH HE COULD NOT CONCEAL
MONSIEUR LE PRINCE WAS A GOOD MASTER BUT I HOPE YOU WILL NOT LOSE BY THE EXCHANGE YES YES RAOUL BE SATISFIED
IF THIS SELF-CONCEITED PRINCE TAKE OUR JEST SERIOUSLY IF HE SHOULD BE IMPRUDENT ENOUGH TO EXHIBIT BEFORE OTHERS ANYTHING LIKE DELIGHT AT IT WELL IN THAT CASE THE KING WILL BE HUMILIATED BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT
HE HAS ASSUMED HIS RESPECTFUL AIR--AND HE WILL POUT FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT MADEMOISELLE SAID MALICORNE BOWING
NO THANK HEAVEN!--I MEAN NO UNFORTUNATELY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE MY APPOINTMENT WOULD BE IMPROVED BY IT
IN WHICH MADAME ACQUIRES A PROOF THAT LISTENERS HEAR WHAT IS SAID
COME ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SAID THE COUNT TO RAOUL WHO SHOOK HIS HEAD SAYING I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD BUT INQUIRED THE CHEVALIER CURIOUS TO LEARN WHENCE RAOUL HAD OBTAINED HIS INFORMATION THE EXACTITUDE OF WHICH HE WAS INWARDLY FORCED TO ADMIT SINCE YOU SAY YOU ARE WELL INFORMED VICOMTE HOW CAN YOU BE BETTER INFORMED THAN MYSELF WHO AM ONE OF THE PRINCE'S MOST INTIMATE COMPANIONS TO SUCH A DECLARATION I SUBMIT
YOUR MAJESTY OVERWHELMS ME BY YOUR REMARK WHY SO BECAUSE IF I HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THE JEST IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INNOCENT WELL IS THAT ALL YOU HAD TO SAY TO ME IN SOLICITING AN AUDIENCE SAID THE KING AS THOUGH ABOUT TO TURN AWAY
HAS HE CHOSE A WIFE WHOSE FORTUNE AND POSITION ACCORD WITH YOUR OWN ANTICIPATION ATHOS HESITATED FOR A MOMENT
IT FOLLOWS THEN MY LORD SHE ADDED THAT YOU WHO ARE A MAN OF FEELING WILL SOON QUIT FRANCE IN ORDER TO SHUT YOURSELF UP WITH YOUR WEALTH AND YOUR RELICS OF THE PAST BUCKINGHAM RAISED HIS HEAD AND SAID I THINK NOT MADAME WHAT DO YOU MEAN ON THE CONTRARY I THINK OF LEAVING ENGLAND IN ORDER TO TAKE UP MY RESIDENCE IN FRANCE IT WAS NOW ANNE OF AUSTRIA'S TURN TO EXHIBIT SURPRISE
HENCEFORTH ADDED LOUIS RISING AND BENDING HIS GLANCE UPON LA VALLIERE HENCEFORTH YOU ARE UNDER MY SAFEGUARD
MANICAMP PRESENTED HIMSELF TO THE COUNT UNDER AN ARCH OF TORCHES WHICH SET IN A BLAZE RATHER THAN ILLUMINATED THE GATE BY WHICH LE HAVRE IS ENTERED AND WHICH IS SITUATED CLOSE TO THE TOWER OF FRANCIS I
NO ONE HOWEVER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS SIGNALS HIS FROWNS OR HIS PITIFUL GESTURES
VERY WELL HE SAID IN A CONCENTRATED TONE OF VOICE THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH I AM RESPECTED IN MY OWN HOUSE MONSEIGNEUR MONSEIGNEUR MURMURED THE CHEVALIER IN THE DUKE'S EAR IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO CALM HIM
MOST FORTUNATELY MONSIEUR WAS IN HIGH GOOD-HUMOR AND HE HAD ENOUGH FOR TWO UNTIL THE TIME ARRIVED FOR DISMISSING HIS SERVANTS AND GENTLEMEN OF THE CHAMBER AND HE PASSED INTO HIS SLEEPING-APARTMENT
THE STORM
DE GUICHE READ IT EAGERLY AND SAID HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND MORE THAN THAT A GALLANT MAN MOST CERTAINLY THE DUKE IS A GALLANT MAN
STAY MONSIEUR
IT IS AS THOUGH YOU WERE TELLING THEM MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE
THESE TWO PERSONS SO OCCUPIED NOT BY THE DEATH OF THE DUKE BUT BY THE CONVERSATION WHICH WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DEATH WERE A YOUNG WOMAN AND A YOUNG MAN
THE KING IS HERE THEN SAID LA VALLIERE NOT VENTURING TO LOOK ROUND HER
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU FOR THE LAST HALF-HOUR RAOUL APPROACHED ATHOS AS HE UNSEALED THE LETTER SAYING WITH YOUR PERMISSION MONSIEUR CERTAINLY DEAR RAOUL WROTE THE COMTE DE GUICHE I HAVE AN AFFAIR IN HAND WHICH REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
DE GUICHE HERE HE WHO IS SO DEVOTED TO MADAME POOR FELLOW SAID LA VALLIERE
EIGHT DAYS AGO WHERE IS SHE THEN IN PARIS HOW IS IT KNOWN THAT THESE LETTERS WERE FROM ME MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS RECOGNIZED YOUR HANDWRITING AND YOUR SEAL SAID MALICORNE
THEREFORE UNDERSTAND ME WELL THE THREAT THAT I HOLD OUT TO YOU IS THIS BUCKINGHAM CLENCHED HIS HANDS BUT RAOUL CONTINUED AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT OBSERVED THE GESTURE
IS A MAN IN LOVE SO VERY DANGEROUS FOR ME
NOW MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IS ONE OF MADAME'S MAIDS OF HONOR
COME BAISEMEAUX IF YOU CAN PLEDGE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR DO SO THAT YOU WILL NOT OPEN YOUR LIPS TO ANY ONE ABOUT WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU NEVER NEVER YOU WISH TO PUT YOUR HANDS ON ARAMIS AT ANY COST WELL GO AND SEE WHERE M
IF HE DOES NOT REMEMBER THEM HE WILL INVENT
I AM LISTENING UNDER THE ROYAL OAK--YOU KNOW WHERE THE ROYAL OAK IS WHAT CAN THAT MATTER
MALICORNE AND YOU MUST POSSESS SOME INDISPUTABLY EXCELLENT QUALITIES TO HAVE PLEASED THAT EGOTISTICAL MANICAMP
THE KING WHO HAD JUST SEEN LA VALLIERE STILL PALE FROM THE EVENT OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING GET INTO A CARRIAGE WITH THREE OF HER COMPANIONS TOLD THE QUEEN THAT HE HAD NO PREFERENCE AND WHEREVER SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE WOULD HE BE WITH HER
I UNDERSTAND YOU
SUDDENLY THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND A SERVANT ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE M
HAVE WE SHOWN OUR GOOD TASTE PERFECT TASTE REPLIED FOUQUET WITHOUT PERMITTING THE SLIGHTEST TONE OF RAILLERY TO BE REMARKED IN HIS WORDS
ALL HEARTS THROBBED ANXIOUSLY AS THE LIST WAS READ OUT
YESTERDAY SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SAUCHETS A LA VIOLETTE
ALL THE ADVANTAGES ARE ON YOUR OWN SIDE
THE KING RODE ON HORSEBACK AND FOR A FEW MINUTES ACCOMPANIED THE CARRIAGE OF THE QUEEN AND MADAME
WHY ONE WOULD SAY YOU ARE READY TO CRY DO PEOPLE NEVER WEEP EXCEPT FROM ENVY OH
YOU ARE BISHOP OF VANNES I BELIEVE YES SIRE VANNES IS IN BRETAGNE I THINK ARAMIS BOWED
HAVING DEVOTED MYSELF TO THE SERVICE OF SUCH A LOVE I WILL LOSE MY LIFE IN IT IT IS NOT THE LADY YOU OUGHT TO REPROACH REPLIED RAOUL
IT IS BUT AN HOUR SINCE I QUITTED YOU IT IS AN AGE SINCE I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU AND THAT WAS ALL
I DO NOT FORGIVE NEGLECT--I CANNOT ENDURE INFIDELITY
HE HAD ALREADY DISPATCHED FOUR LETTERS AND NOT AN ANSWER TO ANY ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN RECEIVED WHEN ON THE VERY MORNING FIXED FOR THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN THE CHAPEL AT THE PALAIS ROYAL RAOUL WHO WAS DRESSING HEARD HIS VALET ANNOUNCE M
COVERS THE YEAR 1660
THE PALLOR OF THE PRINCE AND THE CONVULSIVE TWITCHING OF HIS HANDS AND LIMBS WERE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS THAT STRUCK THOSE PRESENT
MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE SAID THE PRINCESS HAVE THE GOODNESS I BEG TO SEE IF MY ATTENDANTS ARE NOT SOMEWHERE YONDER EITHER IN THE WALKS OR IN THE GROVES
WHY AM I INTERRUPTED WHEN I AM ENGAGED ON BUSINESS YOU WERE GOING TO M
DE WARDES AND I FULLY APPRECIATE YOUR KINDNESS
I WILL TELL HIM AND HE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MY HEART WAS TORN BY MY REFUSAL AND HE IN HIS LOVE FOR ME AWARE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF MY SACRIFICE,--HE IN HIS TURN I SAY WILL STORE HIS DEVOTION FOR ME,--WILL RESPECT ME AND WILL NOT SEEK MY RUIN TO INSULT ME WHEN I SHALL HAVE FALLEN AS YOU SAID JUST NOW WHILST UTTERING YOUR BLASPHEMIES AGAINST LOVE SUCH AS I UNDERSTAND IT
BY THE BY DE WARDES CONTINUED DE GUICHE YOU WHO ARE SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THESE MATTERS CAN YOU TELL US PROBABLY WHAT APPOINTMENTS ARE STILL VACANT AT THE COURT
AND WHY NOT ONLY WERE HIS THOUGHTS OCCUPIED ABOUT HER BUT STILL MORE WHY WERE THEY SO CONTINUOUSLY OCCUPIED ABOUT HER
SHE DOES NOT LOVE M
IN THE SAME WAY MONSIEUR DE WARDES WHOSE HEAD WAS DOUBTLESS A LITTLE BEWILDERED BY THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING SOMEHOW FORGOT TO LEAVE BEHIND HIM THE SIXTY DOUBLE LOUIS WHICH HE HAD WON FOR THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AND WHICH THE DUKE INCAPABLE LIKE HIS FATHER OF SOILING HIS HANDS WITH COIN OF ANY SORT HAD LEFT LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE PRESENT
YOU KNOW THE PERSON WE ARE SPEAKING OF M
NO DOUBT OF IT
IN THE MORNINGS THERE ARE VISITS CORRESPONDENCES AND TOILETTES
DE BRAGELONNE HAD WRITTEN SEVERAL LETTERS TO YOU BUT YOUR MOTHER WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO REMAINED BEHIND AT BLOIS AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THESE LETTERS FROM FALLING INTO HER HANDS
BRIEF AS THE CONVERSATION WAS DE LORRAINE SAW WITH THE MOST UNFEIGNED DISPLEASURE THE FIGURE OF HIS UNKNOWN BECOMING DIMMER IN THE DISTANCE AND FAST DISAPPEARING IN THE DARKNESS
THE COURTIER FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
BUT DO YOU THINK I HAVE A GREATER RIGHT THAN YOU HAVE YOU ARE A MORE IMPORTANT PERSONAGE YES YOU'RE RIGHT
D'ARTAGNAN'S SWORD KILLS
DE CONDE ALWAYS NEEDY AS A DE CONDE OFTEN BORROWED MONEY AT ENORMOUS INTEREST
MALA AND MAUVAISE_--YOU UNDERSTAND IT IS THE SAME THING
IT ILL BECOMES US TO TURN SUCH MATTERS INTO RIDICULE
YOU ARE WANTING IN COURTESY IN REPROACHING ME WITH MISFORTUNE
MADAME IS VERY PROBABLY JEALOUS OF THE REGARD YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO TESTIFY FOR ME HAS SHE SHOWN IT TO YOU MADAME NEVER ADDRESSES A SYLLABLE TO ME PARTICULARLY SINCE A CERTAIN TIME SINCE WHAT TIME SINCE THE TIME WHEN M
THE GOVERNOR APPEARED AT THE DOOR AND GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH IMMEDIATELY PREPARED TO START
SHE WILL BE DELIGHTED AND LA VALLIERE VENTURED THE PRINCESS
ADIEU
IT RARELY HAPPENED THAT ANY UNEASINESS WAS EXCITED ON HIS ACCOUNT WHENEVER A QUESTION OF ELEGANCE OR TASTE WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
FOR SINCE WE ARE GOING TO BOTH IT MATTERS VERY LITTLE WHETHER WE ASCEND FROM THE SECOND TO THE THIRD STORY OR DESCEND FROM THE THIRD TO THE SECOND NO NO EXCLAIMED ARAMIS EAGERLY HIGHER IF YOU PLEASE
SHE IS A SINGULARLY ACTIVE YOUNG LADY YOU KNOW HER INDIRECTLY
THANKS TO THAT SORT OF COQUETRY FOR INDEED THAT IS GENUINE COQUETRY CONTINUED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
COVERS THE YEARS 1660-1661
COVERS THE YEARS 1660-1661
ARE THEY BALAS-RUBIES MADAME HERE THEY ARE THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL--MAGNIFICENT
IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED WHAT WAS MADAME'S MOTIVE FOR AN ATTACK SO SKILLFULLY CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED
SHE IS SLIGHTLY LAME IT IS TRUE BUT SHE IS NOT DEFICIENT IN GOOD SENSE
LOOK ONLY HOW THEY ARE LAUGHING AND FLIRTING
THE WRITING WAS THAT OF MADEMOISELLE AURE AND INCLOSED WERE THESE WORDS:--"PARIS PALAIS ROYAL
IT WAS LA VALLIERE WHOM MONTALAIS SUPPORTED IN THAT MANNER BY WHISPERING SOME OF THAT COURAGE TO HER WITH WHICH SHE HERSELF WAS SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED
COLBERT NOTHING HOWEVER HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN
WHAT THEN NOW ADDED MANICAMP LET THE QUESTION BE REGARDING THE DUCHESS--OR THE DUKE
YOU GIVE ME BOTH HOPE AND CONFIDENCE SAID MADAME AND THE BRACELETS WON IN THIS MANNER WILL BE A HUNDRED TIMES MORE PRECIOUS TO ME WELL
YOU PROBABLY KNOW I DO MONSIEUR FOR PITY'S SAKE TELL ME THEN IMPOSSIBLE MONSIEUR WHY SO BECAUSE MADEMOISELLE AURE HAS FORBIDDEN ME TO DO SO RAOUL LOOKED AT HIS STRANGE VISITOR AND REMAINED SILENT;--"AT LEAST TELL ME WHETHER IT IS FORTUNATE OR UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU WILL SEE YOU ARE VERY SEVERE IN YOUR RESERVATIONS WILL YOU GRANT ME ONE FAVOR MONSIEUR SAID MALICORNE
HE WORE AN AIR OF ANIMATED JOYOUSNESS AND GOOD-HUMOR WHICH SET ALL IMAGINATIONS AT WORK AND THEREUPON ALL PRESENT PROMISED THEMSELVES A DELIGHTFUL EVENING FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN FROM HAVING REMARKED THE DESIRE HIS MAJESTY HAD TO AMUSE HIMSELF IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS
WE MUST TAKE CARE OF THAT WHY BECAUSE IT IS TERRIBLE TO HAVE THE HEART OCCUPIED WHEN OTHERS BESIDES YOURSELF HAVE SO MUCH NEED OF THE HEAD YOU ARE RIGHT
DO YOU NOT KNOW THE DATES MORE PRECISELY IT WAS NOT IN MY TIME M
AND AT FIRST I CONCLUDED YOU WERE NOT IN POSSESSION OF YOUR SENSES BUT I HAVE SINCE SURMISED THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF YOUR MADNESS MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED BUCKINGHAM
THESE SEVEN PERSONS ACCOMPANIED BY A SUITABLE RETINUE WERE THE FOLLOWING FIRST OF ALL A BRIGADIER IN THE GERMAN ARMY HIS SECRETARY PHYSICIAN THREE SERVANTS AND SEVEN HORSES
LOUIS WAS MORE EASILY CAPTIVATED BY VANITY THAN AFFECTION
DE BRAGELONNE AND YOU SHALL GIVE ME SATISFACTION FOR THAT INSULT DE WARDES CAST A LOOK UPON DE BRAGELONNE WHO FAITHFUL TO THE CHARACTER HE HAD ASSUMED REMAINED CALM AND UNMOVED EVEN AFTER THE DUKE'S DEFIANCE
OVERWHELM ME MADAME FOR I HAVE NOTHING TO REPLY I OFFERED YOU MY FRIENDSHIP M
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS SHE CONTINUED
BESIDES MONSIEUR WAS NOT ONE TO BEAR ILL-FEELING FOR A LONG TIME PAST DURING HIS RESIDENCE AT THE COURT THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HAD DECIDED THAT OF LOUIS XIII.'S TWO SONS MONSIEUR WAS THE ONE WHO HAD INHERITED THE FATHER'S CHARACTER--AN UNCERTAIN IRRESOLUTE CHARACTER
IF WE WERE BOTH THERE WE SHOULD BE DISCOVERED
THEIR FACES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN RAISED WERE AGAIN LOWERED BUT THE ONLY FAIR HEAD AMONG THEM REMAINED MOTIONLESS AS IF ALL THE STRENGTH AND INTELLIGENCE SHE HAD LEFT HAD ABANDONED HER
THE COUNT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TRADESPEOPLE AND OF HIS SERVANTS WAS ENGAGED IN PRAISING OR BLAMING AS THE CASE SEEMED TO DESERVE THE APPOINTMENTS HORSES AND HARNESS THAT WERE BEING SUBMITTED TO HIM
DID NOT THE NAIAD SAY PRECISELY WHAT I HAVE RELATED AND HAVE I IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR EXCEEDED THE TRUTH PHYLLIS
OH SIRE MURMURED LA VALLIERE PUSHING THE KING'S HAT TOWARDS HIM
SIRE WILL YOU GRACIOUSLY EXCUSE MY APPEARANCE AT THE REPETITION
WHAT DOES IT MATTER SHE SAID SERIOUSLY WHETHER THE DUKE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME OR NOT
D'HERBLAY SPOKE ON MY BEHALF TO LOUVIERE AND TREMBLAY--THEY OBJECTED
THIS STATE OF THINGS CANNOT CONTINUE
THIS MIGHTY MONARCH WAS HOWEVER MORE TIMID AND MORE RESERVED THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE KINGDOM TO SUCH A DEGREE INDEED THAT HE DID NOT CONFESS HIS SENTIMENTS EVEN TO HIMSELF
AT THE REFLUX HOWEVER THE DUKE AND DE WARDES WERE DISCOVERED LYING ON THE STRAND
LOUISE HERE
HANDSOME AND NOBLE HE STILL WAS AND THE MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION OF HIS MOUTH A RARE EXPRESSION WITH MEN GAVE A NEW CHARACTER TO HIS FEATURES BY WHICH HIS YOUTH SEEMED TO BE RENEWED
SHE NEXT FORMED THE PROJECT OF TRANSPORTING THE COURT TO HER OWN APARTMENTS AND OF ATTRACTING MADAME WITH HER BRILLIANT ESCORT TO HER GLOOMY AND ALREADY SORROWFUL ABODE WHERE THE WIDOW OF A KING OF FRANCE AND THE MOTHER OF A KING OF FRANCE WAS REDUCED TO CONSOLE IN HER ARTIFICIAL WIDOWHOOD THE WEEPING WIFE OF A KING OF FRANCE
I SAID YOU ARE REGARDING WITH WISTFUL FEELINGS AND MOST INJURIOUS DESIRE THE SISTER OF YOUR PRINCE,--HER TO WHOM YOU ARE NOT AFFIANCED WHO IS NOT WHO CAN NEVER BE ANYTHING TO YOU
SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WALKED AWAY MECHANICALLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GARDENS
I HAVE SAID I WISH TO DIE AND DIE I WILL
THE CHEVALIER RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE CEILING JOINED HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAID NOT A WORD
MY SURPRISE WAS SO GREAT AT SUCH A CONQUEST AND AT SO FORTUNATE A DISCOVERY THAT I WENT NO FURTHER IN MY INQUIRIES
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE PROJECT GUTENBERG HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE WRITINGS OF BOTH THE ALEXANDRE DUMASES FOR SOME TIME NOW AND SINCE WE GET A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ORDER IN WHICH THE BOOKS SHOULD BE READ AND IN WHICH THEY WERE PUBLISHED THESE FOLLOWING COMMENTS SHOULD HOPEFULLY HELP MOST OF OUR READERS
I WELL KNOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE OR RATHER THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE GREATEST QUEEN OF THE WHOLE WORLD COULD BE JEALOUS OF A POOR GIRL LIKE MYSELF
ARE YOU IN MOURNING YES REPLIED MANICAMP
AT THE OTHER END MANICAMP AND MALICORNE WERE BEING PILLAGED AT CARDS BY MONTALAIS AND MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHILE TWO OTHERS WERE STANDING BY LAUGHING
DO YOU THINK SO WOMEN PRETEND TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF PEOPLE'S AFFECTIONS SAID MALICORNE AND THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO READ THE THOUGHTS OF THEIR OWN MINDS AND HEARTS
IT WAS A SERPENT THAT ASSUMED EVERY FORM AND EVERY LENGTH SEEKING WHERE IT MIGHT THRUST ITS HEAD
HAS MADAME FINISHED HER LETTER HE INQUIRED WHEN THE YOUNG GIRL CAME WITHIN REACH OF HIS VOICE
BUT IN IMITATION OF CERTAIN PAINTERS WHO BESTOWED THE FACE OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN ON THE SERPENT WHICH TEMPTED EVE THE LIMNER OF THE SIGN HAD CONFERRED UPON THE PEACOCK THE FEATURES OF A WOMAN
THE KING UNEASY ABOUT ME YES SAID MONTALAIS
IT WILL BE WORTH LISTENING TO SAID MADAME
YOU SEE BUCKINGHAM SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA SADLY HOW YOU PASS FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER AND FIGHT WITH SHADOWS WHEN IT WOULD SEEM SO EASY TO REMAIN AT PEACE WITH YOURSELF IF WE FIGHT MADAME WE DIE ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN GENTLY ABANDONING HIMSELF TO THE MOST GLOOMY DEPRESSION
YOUR MAJESTY HAS THE PLAN HERE IT IS IT IS REALLY CORRECT SIRE
I MYSELF AM RESOLVED THAT I WILL NOT
AT ALL EVENTS IF MY BROTHER WERE JEALOUS INTERRUPTED THE KING
INSTEAD OF REGARDING WITH THAT RESPECT WHICH WAS THEIR DUE THE OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES OF SOCIETY DE WARDES RESOLUTELY ATTACKED IN THE COUNT THE EVER-SOUNDING CHORD OF JUVENILE AUDACITY AND PRIDE
WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE HEARD EVERY SYLLABLE YOU HAVE SAID OH HEAVEN
BRAGELONNE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT THE RIGHT OF PRIORITY SHOULD BE RESPECTED WHILE DE WARDES SUGGESTED THAT THE TOWN SHOULD BE SACKED
AS A MATTER OF COURSE THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE DID NOT QUIT MONSIEUR AND DID NOT FAIL TO DISTIL DROPS OF GALL INTO EVERY WOUND THE LATTER RECEIVED
IF YOU HAVE RETAINED ME THEN IT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT CAUSE IT IS NOT AT LEAST BECAUSE I LOVE YOU CRIED MONTALAIS
MONSIEUR ENTERED THE ROOM ABRUPTLY AS PERSONS DO WHO MEAN WELL AND THINK THEY CONFER PLEASURE OR AS THOSE WHO HOPE TO SURPRISE SOME SECRET THE TERRIBLE REWARD OF JEALOUS PEOPLE
IN THE THREE-VOLUME EDITION THE NOVELS ARE ENTITLED THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE AND THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
THE KING A GOOD SON MORE FROM AFFECTATION THAN FROM AFFECTION HAD AT FIRST BEEN IN THE HABIT OF PASSING AN HOUR IN THE MORNING AND ONE IN THE EVENING WITH HIS MOTHER
IT IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF A FEW MINUTES CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE DUKE AND MYSELF IT IS THAT VERY CONVERSATION I FORBID SAID THE QUEEN RESUMING HER AUTHORITY BECAUSE IT IS UNWORTHY OF YOU BE IT SO
AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE VESTIBULE HE WAVED IN THE AIR THE PAPER WHICH THE PRINCE HAD SIGNED
I HAVE THE HONOR THEREFORE TO INFORM YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THAT THE DRYAD MORE PARTICULARLY INHABITS THE HOLLOWS OF OAKS
THE FACT IS HE HAD PERMITTED HIS HEART TO BE GRATIFIED BY LA VALLIERE'S INNOCENT CONFUSION
DE MANICAMP COST--MONEY LENT NEVER RETURNED--FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED LIVRES PER ANNUM
D'ARTAGNAN ALONE AS FOR THAT M
IT IS AGAIN THAT GOOD-FOR-NOTHING CRIED THE OLD LADY
IN VERY ANGUISH OF MIND HE SANK DOWN IN THE BOAT BURYING HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR WHILST THE BOAT IMPELLED BY THE EXERTIONS OF THE MERRY SAILORS FLEW OVER THE WAVES
MANICAMP RUBBED HIS EAR AND LOOKED UP AT MALICORNE'S WINDOW
A FEW ASHES MAY SOMETIMES APPARENTLY EXTINGUISH THEM
WHAT DOES HE DO WITH HIS MONEY MALICORNE MADE A MOVEMENT TO INDICATE THAT UPON THIS SUBJECT HE WAS AS IGNORANT AS THE COUNT HIMSELF
I HAVE SEEN HER BUT SHE HARDLY STRUCK ME AS BEING SO SHE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD AND MODEST GIRL BUT HAS LITTLE BEAUTY SIRE BEAUTIFUL FAIR HAIR HOWEVER I THINK SO AND HER BLUE EYES ARE TOLERABLY GOOD YES SIRE WITH REGARD TO HER BEAUTY THEN THE MATCH IS BUT AN ORDINARY ONE
THERE WAS A MARQUIS DE LA VALLIERE YES SIRE IT IS HIS DAUGHTER BUT HE DIED AND HIS WIDOW MARRIED AGAIN M
AH SAID THE PRINCE DE CONDE TO RAOUL SHE IS PRESENTABLE ENOUGH YES SAID RAOUL BUT HAS SHE NOT A SOMEWHAT HAUGHTY STYLE BAH
DID EVER ANY ONE KEEP HER SECRETS FROM HER FRIEND THUS
YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH HER WE ARE AFFIANCED OR NEARLY SO THAT IS QUITE ANOTHER THING THEN
IN A FEW WORDS HE EXPLAINED HIS MISSION EXPLAINED IN WHAT WAY HE HAD BECOME ENVOY OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
YOU HAVE MISTAKEN MY FEELINGS RAOUL I HAVE MORE THAN MERE INDULGENCE FOR YOU IN MY HEART RAOUL KISSED AS DEVOTEDLY AS A LOVER COULD HAVE DONE THE HAND HE HELD IN HIS OWN
BUT IF YOU WISH THAT WE SHOULD TALK TOGETHER WE CAN WITHOUT GOING TO THE WOODS OF VINCENNES FIND IN MY OWN GARDEN HERE BEAUTIFUL TREES SHADY GROVES A GREEN SWARD COVERED WITH DAISIES AND VIOLETS THE PERFUME OF WHICH CAN BE PERCEIVED FROM WHERE WE ARE SITTING I REGRET YOUR REFUSAL MY DEAR MARQUISE FOR I WANTED TO POUR OUT MY WHOLE HEART INTO YOURS I REPEAT AGAIN MARGUERITE MY HEART IS YOURS JUST AS MUCH IN THIS ROOM OR BENEATH THE LIME-TREES IN THE GARDEN HERE AS IT WOULD BE UNDER THE OAKS IN THE WOODS YONDER IT IS NOT THE SAME THING FOR ME
YET WHILE YOU LOVE HER RESPECT IN THE FIRST PLACE HER HUSBAND'S RANK THEN HERSELF AND LASTLY YOUR OWN SAFETY THANKS RAOUL WHAT FOR BECAUSE SEEING HOW MUCH I SUFFER THROUGH THIS WOMAN YOU ENDEAVOR TO CONSOLE ME BECAUSE YOU TELL ME ALL THE GOOD OF HER YOU THINK AND PERHAPS EVEN THAT WHICH YOU DO NOT THINK OH SAID RAOUL THERE YOU ARE WRONG COMTE
MAZARIN IS DESTINED TO REMAIN IN PRISON FOREVER WHY SO WHY IT SEEMS THAT HIS CRIME IS A LASTING ONE
YOU WHOM I RESPECT AND WHOM I--LOVE THE KING STARTED
SO THAT MALICORNE WAS THE KING OF THE GAY YOUTH OF ORLEANS HAVING TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED LIVRES TO SCATTER SQUANDER AND WASTE ON FOLLIES OF EVERY KIND
NEXT THE KING WHO IS IN LOVE BOTH WITH MADAME AND LA VALLIERE
HOWEVER AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU IT WILL BE BETTER NOT TO ANTICIPATE EVIL
NOW MY DEAR DE GUICHE SAID THE PRINCE GIVE ME A LITTLE NEWS OF THAT DE GUICHE WHOM I USED TO KNOW FORMERLY AND WHO USED TO PAY ATTENTIONS TO MY WIFE GUICHE BLUSHED TO THE VERY WHITES OF HIS EYES WHILE MONSIEUR BURST OUT LAUGHING AS THOUGH HE HAD MADE THE WITTIEST REMARK IN THE WORLD
A MOMENT'S SILENCE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS AT LAST BROKEN BY MADAME
WILL YOU DO ME THE FAVOR TO EXPLAIN THIS ENIGMA TO ME BECAUSE AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I HAVE HIRED ALL THE HOUSES LOOKING ON THE SQUARE WE ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT SINCE NOTHING BUT THE SQUARE ITSELF HAS BEEN LEFT FOR US YOU ARE MISTAKEN MONSIEUR
IT IS THE HOUR HE USUALLY PAYS ME A VISIT
AT THE VERY FIRST WORD BEYOND THE RESPECT AND DEFERENCE DUE TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS WHICH YOU PERMIT YOURSELF TO USE TOWARDS HER,--BE PATIENT MY LORD FOR I AM PERFECTLY SO YOU UNDOUBTEDLY
THE BALLET OF THE SEASONS
SHALL WE LEAVE HE SAID HASTILY TO ARAMIS
BRAGELONNE HAD HOWEVER INSISTED THAT THEIR THREE VOICES SHOULD BE IN CONCERT INSTEAD OF SINGING IN SOLO PARTS AS DE GUICHE AND HIS RIVAL SEEMED TO HAVE ACQUIRED A DANGEROUS HABIT OF DOING
THE SEA AND THE WINDS THE SHIPS AND MEN TOO THIS REMARK WAS MADE IN A DIGNIFIED AND AUTHORITATIVE MANNER
IS IT POSSIBLE HE INQUIRED BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY THAT YOU NO LONGER LOVE ME I DID NOT SAY SO REPLIED LOUISE SOFTLY
YOUR CUP BRIMS OVER WITH HAPPINESS AND MANY LONG YEARS ARE YET BEFORE YOU IN THAT CASE YOU WILL NOT COME FOR SOME TIME THEN SAID THE QUEEN ENDEAVORING TO SMILE
SHE IS NOT MERELY GIDDY BUT FRIVOLOUS
AND YET MY MESSAGE MUST HAVE REACHED YOU LATE AT NINE IN THE EVENING SIRE YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD LATELY M
AND THAT IS NO SMALL ADVANTAGE IN MY EYES THERE NOW YOU SEE I WILL GO FURTHER AND SAY THAT OF ALL THE MEN WHOM ONE SEES HERE HE IS THE HANDSOMEST AND THE MOST WHAT WAS THAT SAID LA VALLIERE STARTING SUDDENLY FROM THE MOSSY BANK
A DOUBLE BRANCH ALWAYS BLOOMING AND FRUITFUL OF WHICH THOSE WHO WISH TO EAT KNOW HOW TO DETECT THE GOOD FRUIT AND FROM WHICH THE WORTHLESS AND FRIVOLOUS DIE WHO HAVE EATEN OF IT--A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS BY NO MEANS TO BE REGARDED AS A GREAT MISFORTUNE
BUT TO RETURN TO THIS GIRL
BUCKINGHAM AND BRAGELONNE ADMITTING DE GUICHE INTO THEIR FRIENDSHIP IN CONCERT WITH HIM SANG THE PRAISES OF THE PRINCESS DURING THE WHOLE OF THE JOURNEY
DO NOT HESITATE TO TELL ME A THIRD OF ITS VALUE MADAME THERE IS THE OTHER SERVICE THE OLD ONE THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY HUSBAND YES MADAME
HE HAD PROMPTLY INTRENCHED HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE CHAIR AS IF TO AVOID THE FIRST ATTACKS OF MADAME DE SAINT-REMY
THERE WAS NOTHING VERY SEVERE WE WILL EVEN SAY NOTHING VERY ROYAL THAT EVENING ABOUT THE KING EXCEPT YOUTH AND GOOD LOOKS
TWO OTHERS FOLLOWED AT THE DISTANCE OF ABOUT HALF A KNOT
FOR IF A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE YOUR HEAD SHALL BE THE FORFEIT TOBY STARTED BUT IMMEDIATELY RECOVERED HIMSELF
WE HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY THESE FEW DAYS PAST MONSIEUR FOUQUET
HOWEVER IT MAY BE THAT THE LAST LOOK OF SAINT-AIGNAN HAD HARDLY BEEN SO MAJESTIC AS THE KING'S
REALLY MY DEAR GOVERNOR I BEGIN TO THINK YOU ARE ACTING CEREMONIOUSLY WITH ME NO INDEED
HER BEAUTY WILL IMPROVE MORE AND MORE
NO NO RAOUL ALL IS USELESS NOW SAID GUICHE HOLDING BOTH HIS HANDS TOWARDS THE DUKE AND LEADING HIM BEHIND A COLUMN
I AM IN MOURNING FOR WHOM OR FOR WHAT FOR MY BLUE-AND-GOLD SUIT WHICH HAS DISAPPEARED AND IN THE PLACE OF WHICH I COULD FIND NOTHING BUT THIS
DE GUICHE'S ATTENDANTS ARE GONE AND HE MUST HAVE LEFT WITH THEM ASCERTAIN NEVERTHELESS TEN MINUTES HAD HARDLY PASSED WHEN THE VALET RETURNED
THIS STYLE OF HARMONY PLEASED THE QUEEN-MOTHER EXCEEDINGLY BUT IT WAS NOT PERHAPS SO AGREEABLE TO THE YOUNG PRINCESS WHO WAS AN INCARNATION OF COQUETRY AND WHO WITHOUT ANY FEAR AS FAR AS HER OWN VOICE WAS CONCERNED SOUGHT OPPORTUNITIES OF SO PERILOUSLY DISTINGUISHING HERSELF
THE MARQUISE LIGHTED THE CANDLES INHALED THE PERFUME OF THE FLOWERS SAT DOWN AND WAS SOON PLUNGED IN PROFOUND THOUGHT
CHAPTER XIII
THE DUKE TOO PERCEIVED THE DANGER
I WILL HAVE AMYNTAS'S PORTRAIT SAINT-AIGNAN OBEYED AFTER HAVING BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO HIS MAJESTY'S SISTER-IN-LAW
HIS NAME I SAY YOU INSIST UPON IT I DEMAND IT THE VICOMTE DE WARDES VERY WELL SAID ATHOS TRANQUILLY I KNOW HIM
THE APARTMENT I REQUIRE FOR MYSELF VERY WELL
BUT THE GREATEST OF ALL WAS MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS HERSELF
LOOK AT HER,--LOVE HER IF YOU WILL,--FOR NO ONE WHOSE HEART IS NOT ENGAGED ELSEWHERE CAN SEE HER WITHOUT LOVING HER
AND RAOUL CAN EASILY BE FOUND WHEN HE IS SOUGHT FOR AGREED
DID NOT HER VANITY TELL HER ALOUD IN A SUBDUED VOICE IN A WHISPER IN EVERY VARIETY OF TONE THAT SHE COULD NOT IN REALITY SHE A PRINCESS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL AND RICH BE COMPARED TO THE POOR LA VALLIERE AS YOUTHFUL AS HERSELF IT IS TRUE BUT FAR LESS PRETTY CERTAINLY AND UTTERLY WITHOUT MONEY PROTECTORS OR POSITION
IT IS NOT ALWAYS WISE TO DO THAT FOR IT MAY BE AWKWARD FOR THOSE WHO ARE FOLLOWED
IF THE KING WINS HE IS SURE TO GIVE YOU THE BRACELETS I ADMIT THAT IS ONE IF YOU WIN THEM THEY ARE YOURS NATURALLY
I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER YET LOVED YOU
NO ONE SAYS THAT M
BUT HE SUDDENLY BECAME SILENT AND A SIGH ALONE EXPRESSED ALL THAT HIS HEART WAS OVERFLOWING WITH
IN THAT CASE THEN WHAT WOULD PEOPLE SAY
MIGHT IT NOT COME FROM SOME ESTATE WHERE A BULL WITH MORTAL HORNS HAD CAUSED SOME GREAT MISFORTUNE AND BAPTIZED THE SOIL WITH THE BLOOD IT HAD SPILT
SAINT-AIGNAN WHO HAD EXHAUSTED HIS RHETORICAL SKILL AND HIS PALETTE OF ARTISTIC TINTS IN SKETCHING THE PORTRAIT OF GALATEA AND WHO AFTER THE FAVOR WITH WHICH HIS OTHER DESCRIPTIONS HAD BEEN RECEIVED ALREADY IMAGINED HE COULD HEAR THE LOUDEST APPLAUSE ALLOTTED TO THIS LAST ONE WAS HIMSELF MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN THE KING AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY
IT WAS NOT EVEN A PLOT
SHE IS NOT SIMPLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLATTERY SHE IS A PRACTICED AND CRUEL COQUETTE
I KNOW AN AUTHORITY MONSIEUR WHICH I TRUST IS SUCH AS YOU WILL RESPECT SAID BUCKINGHAM PLACING HIS HAND ON HIS SWORD
WHILST HE MALICORNE AND HIS FRIEND MANICAMP SHOULD BETWEEN THEM KNOW ALL THE MALE SECRETS OF THE YOUNG COMMUNITY
DE BRAGELONNE'S HAPPINESS I ONLY AWAIT YOUR MAJESTY'S SIGNATURE
SHE RECALLED WITH TERROR THE ISOLATION IN WHICH CARDINAL RICHELIEU HAD FORMERLY LEFT HER THOSE DREADED AND INSUPPORTABLE EVENINGS DURING WHICH HOWEVER SHE HAD BOTH YOUTH AND BEAUTY WHICH ARE EVER ACCOMPANIED BY HOPE TO CONSOLE HER
FOR FOUR DAYS EVERY KIND OF ENCHANTMENT BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THE MAGNIFICENT GARDENS OF FONTAINEBLEAU HAD CONVERTED THIS SPOT INTO A PLACE OF THE MOST PERFECT ENJOYMENT
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN COUNT THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE THE MOST UNFORTUNATE OF HUSBANDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM IT IS A NAME OF ILL OMEN TO THE PRINCES OF THE HOUSE OF FRANCE AND SO THE DUKE IS MADLY IN LOVE WITH MADAME SO THE RUMOR RUNS AND WILL HAVE NO ONE APPROACH HER BUT HIMSELF DE GUICHE COLORED
I THEREUPON ACCOSTED THE NAIAD AND BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID TO ME
THEY WILL THINK IT STRANGE TO SEE YOU WET THROUGH IN THIS MANNER AND THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RUN SUCH RISK FOR ME I HAVE SIMPLY DONE MY DUTY AS A GENTLEMAN SAID LOUIS
IN SHORT IT APPEARS THAT THIS YOUNG MAN IS A FIRE-EATER SAID LOUIS IN ORDER TO SHARPEN THE SENTIMENT WHICH HE MISTOOK FOR ENVY
THE EVIL IS DONE YOU SAY NO DOUBT
WHAT WAS SAID UNDER THE ROYAL OAK
AND MY REMARKS MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH IN CONTRAST WITH HERS MONTALAIS IS SUCH A GIDDY GIRL SAID MADAME
HAVING ONCE HOWEVER REACHED THE HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN SET APART FOR HIM HE SHUT HIMSELF UP LIKE ACHILLES IN HIS TENT
NOW MESDEMOISELLES WE HAVE AGREED TO AMUSE OURSELVES TO-NIGHT WITHOUT ANY ONE TO OVERLOOK US AND WITHOUT ANY ESCORT
THIS UNDAUNTED MAID OF HONOR MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS BE IT UNDERSTOOD FORCED THE KING TO LOWER HIS GAZE AND SO SAVED LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE FROM A SYMPATHETIC WARMTH OF FEELING THIS GAZE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE CONVEYED
AND THE DUKE WAS SENT AWAY ACCORDINGLY NO NOT SENT AWAY DRIVEN AWAY DISMISSED EXPELLED THEN IF YOU PREFER IT SIRE
THE CHEVALIER HASTILY WHISPERED TO THE VALET BE SURE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE BEFORE THAT LITTLE DOOR SO THAT NO ONE CAN ESCAPE IN THAT DIRECTION
TO LEARN BY MEANS OF THIS WOMAN ALL THE FEMININE SECRETS OF THE YOUNG HOUSEHOLD
THE HOUR IS PERHAPS BADLY CHOSEN
HE WAS JUST IN TIME
SAINT-AIGNAN FOLLOWED HIM AT A SHORT DISTANCE
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS THIS THAT I WOULD PREFER BEING MADE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS FOR HAVING CHARGED A BATTERY AT THE HEAD OF MY COMPANY OR TAKEN A CITY THAN FOR CAUSING TWO WRETCHES TO BE HUNG IS THIS QUITE TRUE YOU TELL ME AND WHY SHOULD YOUR MAJESTY SUSPECT ME OF DISSIMULATION I ASK BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN YOU WELL MONSIEUR
DE GUICHE TWO OF MY FRIENDS THAT'S WELL SAID D'ARTAGNAN
I WOULD ACCEPT ONE OF THE FURIES IF YOU WERE TO INSIST UPON IT LA VALLIERE IS AS GENTLE AS A LAMB
THE KING ALLOWED HIM TO FINISH THE COMPLIMENTS WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO HIM AND FIXED A LONG LOOK UPON A COUNTENANCE WHICH NO ONE COULD FORGET AFTER HAVING ONCE BEHELD IT
THEY WERE RECEIVED AT THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL BY A SHOUT OF TRIUMPH
THEN BY MEANS OF ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO WAS PASSING HE SENT TO APPRISE MALICORNE WHO WAS STILL WITH MONSIEUR
MEN OF YOUR STAMP ARE CREATED TO CONTINUE TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR GREAT FACULTIES
THE FEW PRIVILEGED COURTIERS WHO SURROUNDED MONSIEUR THOUGHT IT THEIR DUTY TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THEY HAD NOT HEARD THE REMARK AND A NOISY BURST OF LAUGHTER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST COURTIER PASSING ON THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPANY AND ONLY TERMINATING WITH THE LAST
YOU ARE THE BISHOP OF VANNES YES MY LORD I KNOW YOU I HAVE SEEN YOU AT THE LAST JUBILEE WE WERE WITH THE HOLY FATHER TOGETHER YES YES I REMEMBER
HOW YOU GAINSAY YOUR ORIGIN AND THE DESTINY OF YOUR NOBLE NATURE
AND FORGIVE ALSO THE ABSENCE OF THE FORMALITIES WHICH MAY BE WANTING IN THIS LETTER
IN THE NAME OF THAT AFFECTION YOU WISH ME TO SACRIFICE MY REPUTATION AND MY HONOR YET WHEN I OFFER YOU MONEY WHICH IS MY OWN YOU REFUSE ME MADAME YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO PRESERVE WHAT YOU TERM YOUR REPUTATION AND YOUR HONOR
AN IDEA OCCURS TO ME SHE SAID
THAT WOULD BE ACTING LIKE A WEAK AND WHIMSICAL HUSBAND IT IS THE DUTY OF A GOOD HUSBAND TO DO SO
YES SAID THE KING
I SHALL EXPECT YOU THIS EVENING COMTE TO JOIN MY CARD-TABLE I AM IN TRAVELING-COSTUME SIRE A DAY WILL COME I HOPE WHEN YOU WILL LEAVE ME NO MORE
AND YOU WISHED TO GO TO VINCENNES,--TO SAINT-MANDE EVEN I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I WISHED
HE LIFTED HIS FEET PAINFULLY AT EVERY STEP ON WHICH RESOUNDED THE CLINK OF HIS BLOOD-STAINED SPURS
SHE USED THEN BUT DID NOT ABUSE HER TRIUMPH
THEIR SWORDS CROSSED AT THE SAME MOMENT LIKE TWO FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ON A DARK NIGHT
NOCTE PLUIT TOTA REDEUNT SPECTACULA MANE
TO-DAY IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE FOUND IT
ARE YOU NOT BETTER LOUISE BUT LOUISE DID NOT ANSWER
COLBERT IS POWERFUL
DO I NOT ALREADY KNOW HER
THE ONLY PASSAGE WHICH LED TO THE STEPS OF THE HOTEL AND WHICH WAS NOT INCLOSED BY THE SILKEN BARRICADE WAS GUARDED BY TWO TENTS RESEMBLING TWO PAVILIONS THE DOORWAYS OF BOTH OF WHICH OPENED TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE
WE OUGHT TO GET SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS FROM THE SIDE OF SPAIN RAISING HIS HEAD HE PERCEIVED THE CONFESSOR WHO WAS AWAITING HIS ORDERS AS RESPECTFULLY AS A SCHOOL-BOY
NO COMMUNICATIONS WITH ANY ONE
MADAME AND HER MOTHER ALIGHTED AT THE LOUVRE WHERE DURING THEIR EXILE THEY HAD SO GLOOMILY SUBMITTED TO OBSCURITY MISERY AND PRIVATIONS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION
OUR CHARMING INVALID SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
RINGS NECKLACES SPRIGS EAR-RINGS CLASPS
WHAT DID YOU NOT REMARK THAT INSTEAD OF ORDERING HIM TO GO AWAY AGAIN INTO EXILE AS WAS NATURAL HE ENCOURAGED HIM IN HIS OPPOSITION BY PERMITTING HIM TO RESUME HIS PLACE IN THE BALLET AND YOU THINK THE KING WAS WRONG CHEVALIER SAID THE PRINCE
I ABSOLVE YOU
BUT ALTHOUGH ON REFLECTION IT APPEARED DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT SHE DID NOT DESPAIR OF SUCCESS
THE KING WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY SATISFACTION
TOWARDS TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THE SUN SHONE FORTH ANEW THE WIND SUBSIDED THE SEA BECAME SMOOTH AS A CRYSTAL MIRROR AND THE FOG WHICH HAD SHROUDED THE COAST DISAPPEARED LIKE A VEIL WITHDRAWN BEFORE IT
IF SHE HAD BEEN THE INSTIGATOR OF IT IT CERTAINLY WAS A BOLD MEASURE ON HER PART BUT AT ALL EVENTS IT WAS BUT NATURAL IN HER
AND HE MIGHT NOT PERHAPS BE FOUND UNWORTHY OF IT IF HE WERE ONLY SUFFICIENTLY WELL-KNOWN THIS LATTER PARAGRAPH STRENGTHENED BY A KILLING GLANCE WAS DIRECTED STRAIGHT TO MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHO RECEIVED THEM BOTH UNMOVED
I UNHAPPY HE SAID ENDEAVORING TO SMILE
THE KING JEALOUS AS A YOUNG MAN AND AS A MONARCH OF THE SUPERIORITY OF THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HIM COULD NOT RESIST ADMITTING HIMSELF VANQUISHED BY A PETULANCE SO THOROUGHLY FRENCH IN ITS NATURE WHOSE ENERGY MORE THAN EVER INCREASED BY ENGLISH HUMOR
AND THESE GENTLEMEN AS WELL AS MYSELF ARE QUITE SATISFIED WITH YOU BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR THAT YOUR RECONCILIATIONS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT WAY BECAUSE AS WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO SEPARATE I WOULD WAGER THAT M
SHE PERCEIVED AT THE VERY FIRST WORDS HE PRONOUNCED THAT LOUIS WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BE SEVERE
THUS AND DRAWING OFF THE RING HE PASSED IT ON ARAMIS'S FINGER
AND I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT IN THE WORLD THAT IF I WERE TO FOLLOW YOUR DIRECTIONS I SHOULD LOSE MY WAY IMMEDIATELY
FOR HE VERY WELL KNEW THE ART OF UNLOCKING THE LIPS OF A DRESS-MAKER OR A LADY'S MAID AS TO HER MISTRESS'S INTENTIONS
ANNE BEGAN TO REFLECT
WHY YOU BEGIN BY THE MOST RECKLESS INCONSISTENCIES
DO NOT FORGET ME IN YOUR PRAYERS I ENTREAT OH CRIED LA VALLIERE BE ASSURED THAT YOU AND HEAVEN ARE IN MY HEART TOGETHER THESE WORDS OF LOUISE ELATED THE KING WHO FULL OF HAPPINESS HURRIED SAINT-AIGNAN DOWN THE STAIRS
AND AS I CANNOT HAVE YOU WITH ME ALWAYS I WISH TO RETURN TO BLOIS HOW WRONG YOU ARE ATHOS
AND RAOUL AS HE GRASPED HIS FRIEND'S HAND GLANCED RAPIDLY AT HIS TWO COMPANIONS HOPING TO BE ABLE TO READ ON THEIR FACES WHAT WAS PASSING IN THEIR MINDS
WHAT HE EXCLAIMED ANOTHER MAID OF HONOR
WHEN I WOULD GIVE THE WORLD TO FORGET WHAT I DID SAY HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT EVERY ONE DOES ALL HE POSSIBLY CAN TO REMIND ME OF IT
DE GUICHE I DID NOT SEE YOU THE COMTE BOWED AND MADAME TURNED PALE
FOUQUET M
I WILL CONSULT MY FATHER REFLECT M
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IDEA DE GUICHE WHY IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE SHIVER MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED DE GUICHE WHO SHUDDERED IN REALITY
THERE IS NO GREATER DIFFICULTY IN THE WAY THAN THAT VERY WELL
HE ASKED ME SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND THAT WAS ALL WELL WAS HE LESS DISCREET THEN WITH ME WHAT DID HE TELL YOU THAT THE KING IS PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WE KNEW THAT ALREADY REPLIED MALICORNE IRONICALLY
FORGET THAT I BEG OR ALLOW ME TO REMEMBER IT FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO THANK YOU ONCE MORE FOR YOUR LETTER AND SIRE INTERRUPTED LA VALLIERE THE RAIN IS FALLING AND YOUR MAJESTY'S HEAD IS UNCOVERED I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING BUT YOURSELF OH
THE KING SMILED UPON DE GUICHE WHO DID NOT COMPREHEND A WORD OF MADAME'S DUMB LANGUAGE BUT HE REMARKED THAT SHE PRETENDED NOT TO LOOK AT HIM AND HE ATTRIBUTED THE PARDON WHICH HAD BEEN CONFERRED UPON HIM TO THE PRINCESS'S KINDNESS OF HEART
SHE HOLDS CERTAIN PAPERS IN HER HANDS THAT COMPROMISE THE ORDER
NO INDEED SAID MALICORNE
HE HEARD BOTH BUCKINGHAM'S ENTREATY AND THE PRINCESS'S REPLY
THEN READING THE PAPER A SECOND TIME HE CALLED OUT APPROACH APPROACH QUICKLY ARAMIS RETURNED TO THE SIDE OF THE FRANCISCAN WITH THE SAME CALM COUNTENANCE AND THE SAME RESPECTFUL MANNER UNCHANGED
I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE USE AGAINST ANY OF MY SERVANTS OF A MEANS OF PRESSURE WHICH MAY OPPRESS HIM AND FETTER HIS SERVICES
THE POOR FELLOW IS MADE THE VICTIM OF YOUR VIRTUE JUST AS HE WOULD BE NAY MORE THAN HE WOULD BE EVEN--OF MY COQUETRY OR ATHENAIS'S PRIDE ALL THIS IS SIMPLY A DIFFERENT SHADE OF COQUETRY SAID ATHENAIS
WHEN HOWEVER HE HELD IN HIS HAND GUICHE OBSERVED THAT HE STILL AWAITED SOMETHING FURTHER
YOU HAVE REFLECTED WELL UPON IT HE INQUIRED
MAJESTY HOWEVER PRECLUDES HURRY
DE WARDES HAS DONE ME THE HONOR TO PAY ME A VISIT IN COMPANY WITH SOME OF HIS OWN FRIENDS AS WELL AS OF OURS IN FACT BEHIND THE MUSKETEER APPEARED DE WARDES AND MANICAMP FOLLOWED BY DE GUICHE AND BUCKINGHAM WHO LOOKED SURPRISED NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF THEM
WELL THEN MY DEAR MARQUISE IT IS SAID FOR SOME TIME PAST YOU NO LONGER CONTINUE TO REGRET MONSIEUR DE BELLIERE AS YOU USED TO IT IS AN ILL-NATURED REPORT MARGUERITE
WELL I WANT MY APPOINTMENT
I SUPPOSE MY BROTHER IS KEPT A LITTLE AT A DISTANCE SAID THE KING
IT WAS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THIS LIST HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ETIQUETTE
BAISEMEAUX INSTALLED THE PRELATE WITH THAT ALL-INCLUSIVE POLITENESS OF WHICH A GOOD MAN OR A GRATEFUL MAN ALONE POSSESSES THE SECRET
ARAMIS AGAIN LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT FURTHER BETRAYAL OF HIS THOUGHTS THAN A PLACID SMILE
HE IS AMIABLE HE HAS A GREAT FRIENDSHIP FOR ME AND HE AMUSES ME IF MONSIEUR WERE ONLY TO HEAR YOU SAID THE KING SLIGHTLY ANNOYED DO YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE TO MAKE IT UP AGAIN BETWEEN YOU
THERE IS NO AMUSEMENT SO SERIOUS CONTINUED THE QUEEN AS TO PREVENT A MAN OF YOUR RANK YOUR MAJESTY SEEMS TO INSIST GREATLY ON THAT POINT INTERRUPTED THE DUKE
GRISART IMMEDIATELY THE LANDLORD MOVED IN PROMPT OBEDIENCE TO THE DIRECTION
I ONLY ASK WHY YOU SHOULD GO TO M
BUT NOT ONE HAND WAS HELD OUT TOWARDS DE WARDES
YOU KNEW MY FATHER AND MOTHER WHOM YOUR OWN FATHER AND MOTHER SERVED
FOR HE IS A PERSON OF ONLY SECONDARY IMPORTANCE MY DEAR VICOMTE DO YOU NOT KNOW BETTER THAN THAT SAID THE PRINCE
AND UNLESS THE GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU A MOMENT AGO ENCOUNTERED WAS THE KING HIMSELF AND THE CHEVALIER PAUSED HOPING THAT IN THIS MANNER HE MIGHT LEARN WHO IT WAS HE HAD BEEN HURRYING AFTER
FOR THE REST A JOYOUS BEAM OF THE SUN FOR THE SUN APPEARED TO CARE LITTLE FOR THE LOSS FRANCE HAD JUST SUFFERED
AURE WOULD HAVE CRIED OUT BUT THE CRY WAS STIFLED IN HIS KISS
TURN TO THE LEFT MADAME IF YOU PLEASE AND YOU ARE SURE OF MONTALAIS SAID MADAME
MENTAL AND BODILY SUFFERING HAD PRODUCED UPON HER FEATURES A SOFT AND NOBLE EXPRESSION OF GRIEF
FOUQUET THAT I HAD A GREAT MANY THINGS TO SAY TO YOU CONTINUED THE KING WITH A MOST GRACIOUS AIR
LEAVE ME D'HERBLAY
TO-DAY WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY DANGER OR UNEASINESS AND BY THE SUNNIEST PATH IN THE WORLD I AM GOING IN SEARCH OF A GLORIOUS RECOMPENSE WHICH THIS MARK OF THE KING'S FAVOR SEEMS TO INDICATE FOR I AM PERHAPS GOING TO WIN YOU LOUISE
THE CUSTOMARY TITLE OF MONSIEUR WILL GO TO HIM AS WELL AND UPON HIS FUTURE WIFE HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND THAT OF MADAME GASTON'S WIDOW WILL BE REFERRED TO AS THE DOWAGER MADAME."--JB CHAPTER I
WELL INQUIRED ARAMIS WHO WAS IMPATIENTLY WAITING FOUQUET'S RETURN ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE FAVORITE ENCHANTED REPLIED FOUQUET
BUT WHAT SHE DID KNOW WAS THAT SHE COULD FRAME NO WISH AND THAT SHE FELT HERSELF TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
A WOMAN'S EAR IS NOT INFALLIBLE SO SAYS SAINT AUGUSTINE
YOU MIGHT EVEN YET MAKE ME PAY DEARER FOR YOUR STAY IN FRANCE SIRE SOME ONE APPROACHES WELL ONE LAST WORD SAY IT YOU ARE PRUDENT AND JUDICIOUS SIRE
HE HAD NOT NOTICED THE PRINCESS'S BLUSH OR IF HE HAD SEEN IT HE WAS FAR FROM ATTRIBUTING IT TO ITS TRUE CAUSE
YOU FORGET WHOM YOU ARE ADDRESSING BUCKINGHAM THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES
GALATEA SAID SAINT-AIGNAN IN CONCLUSION IS WORTHY OF THE ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE WORLD
WHERE NO ONE THIS TIME VENTURED TO FOLLOW HIM
IT WAS A MOST SHAMEFUL DECEPTION I ADMIT SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND I HAVE NOT WAITED FOR M
HE MERELY THANKED FORTUNE FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM IN ADDRESSING A SLIGHT SALUTATION TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS HER PROXY
THE TWO WOMEN WALKED SO FAST THAT THE RUSTLING OF THEIR DRESSES COULD BE DISTINGUISHED THROUGH THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT
THEY WERE NOT AS FLEET AS THE ENGLISH HORSES OF M
AND THIS CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF AT THE VERY MOMENT HE TURNED THE ANGLE THE CHEVALIER HAD NOT RUN AGAINST TWO PERSONS WHO WERE THEMSELVES WHEELING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
KING LOUIS XIV
HE HASTILY TORE OPEN THE LETTER WHICH HOWEVER CONTAINED ONLY THESE WORDS
YOUR MAJESTY DID NOT TRUST TO ME ALONE BUT SENT SOME OTHER PERSON SAID HE IN A REPROACHFUL TONE
THE SHEPHERD AMYNTAS IS SO TIMID SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WITH THE MOST MODEST AIR HE COULD ASSUME THAT IF HE CHERISHES SUCH A HOPE AS THAT NO ONE HAS EVER KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT IT FOR HE CONCEALS IT IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF HIS HEART A FLATTERING MURMUR OF APPLAUSE GREETED THIS PROFESSION OF FAITH ON BEHALF OF THE SHEPHERD
HAVE FAITH IN ME AND DOUBT NOTHING THE FACT IS I CANNOT BUT DOUBT BECAUSE I DO NOT SEE CLEARLY OR EVEN AT ALL THAT IS BECAUSE OF YOUR BLINDNESS
SINCE YESTERDAY EVERY ONE SPIES ON US HERE AND A CIRCLE SEEMS TO BE DRAWN ROUND US AS IF WE WERE PLAGUE-STRICKEN LA VALLIERE BENT DOWN HER HEAD AND SIGHED
WHAT YOU SAID OF M
NOW IS IT NOT EXTRAORDINARY THAT THIS RESPECT SHOULD BE SHOWN BY A PRELATE OF THE CHURCH FOR A SIMPLE MONK FOR ONE TOO BELONGING TO A MENDICANT ORDER
SEND FOR A SURGEON
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE SO CLOSE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IN THE ARMS OF EACH OTHER IF MONTALAIS HAD NOT VIOLENTLY PUSHED MALICORNE WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR JUST THEN OPENING
DE GUICHE'S IS REMARKED AS MUCH PARDON ME MONSEIGNEUR
I AM SURE WE SHALL BE VERY MERRY
THE FAVORITE VAIN OF HIS TWOFOLD IMPORTANCE AND FEELING THAT HE HAD BECOME DURING THE LAST TWO HOURS THE CONFIDANT OF THE KING BEGAN TO TREAT THE AFFAIRS OF THE COURT IN A SOMEWHAT INDIFFERENT MANNER
NOTHING COULD BE MORE CHARMING MORE GRACEFUL MORE POETICAL THAN THESE TWO FIGURES BURIED UNDER THE ROSE-COLORED SHADE OF THE PARASOL THE KING WHOSE WHITE TEETH WERE DISPLAYED IN CONTINUAL SMILES AND MADAME WHOSE BLACK EYES SPARKLED LIKE CARBUNCLES IN THE GLITTERING REFLECTION OF THE CHANGING HUES OF THE SILK
WHILE HERE IT WOULD BE A DISPLAY AND WOULD EXCITE REMARK--YOU WISH THAT OTHERS SHOULD TALK ABOUT YOU IN WHAT MANNER YOU DO NOT CARE
MALICORNE PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF MANICAMP AND WAS IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED
AND IF YOU WERE TO KILL YOURSELF YOU SPRINKLE BLOOD UPON THE NUPTIAL ROBE OF THE PRINCESS OF ENGLAND BUCKINGHAM REMAINED A MINUTE GASPING FOR BREATH
WHAT IS IT THE BAD RECEPTION WHICH HIS MAJESTY IN APPEARANCE GAVE THE COMTE DE GUICHE IN APPEARANCE YES CERTAINLY
POOR GIRL SAID THE PRINCESS QUIETLY WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF IT SHE THEN ADDED IN AN UNDERTONE YOU FORGET SIRE THAT YOU WISH OTHERS TO BELIEVE IN YOUR PASSION FOR THIS GIRL AND YET YOU REMAIN HERE WHILE SHE IS ALMOST DYING PERHAPS ELSEWHERE AH
THE FRANCISCAN INQUIRED WHERE THEY WERE BOTH SITUATED
YOU SEE DE GUICHE I DO NOT WISH THAT EITHER MY WIFE OR MYSELF SHOULD HAVE UGLY FACES BEFORE OUR EYES
THAT IS WELL
FORTUNATELY A CARRIAGE WAS PASSING
REFLECT THAT IF THE COUNT WERE TO LEAVE IT WOULD BE AN ADMISSION THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING WHICH MERITED REBUKE WHY SO NO DOUBT OF IT
ALL THIS SCENE ENTERED INTO THE MIND OF D'ARTAGNAN BY THE EYES AND EARS AT ONCE
FOUQUET ON BEHALF OF HIS MAJESTY MANICAMP TOUCHED DE GUICHE'S ELBOW SAYING THERE'S A PRETEXT FOR YOU WHAT M
ASK THE JAILER FOR THE KEYS WHISPERED ARAMIS
MY NAME IS MANICAMP REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN IN A VOICE WHOSE TONES WERE AS HARMONIOUS AND SWEET AS THE NOTES OF AN AEOLIAN HARP
FOUQUET THEY WILL ATTACH THEMSELVES TO M
THE BROTHER OF HIS GRAY EMINENCE MADE HIS FORTUNE HERE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR GOVERNOR SAID ARAMIS DRAWING CLOSER TO BAISEMEAUX A YOUNG KING IS WELL WORTH AN OLD CARDINAL
AT THE VERY MOMENT THE TWO YOUNG MEN APPEARED AT THE END OF ONE OF THE STREETS LEADING TO THE SQUARE THEY PERCEIVED CROSSING THE SQUARE AT FULL GALLOP A YOUNG MAN ON HORSEBACK WHOSE COSTUME WAS OF SURPRISING RICHNESS
YET NOT WITHOUT REMEDY I HOPE RETURNED DE GUICHE
TAKE CARE SIRE SAID MADAME HURRIEDLY MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN IS LOOKING AT YOU OF COURSE SAID LOUIS ANGRILY
I CAME HERE EXPECTING TO FIND YOU ILL AND LOW-SPIRITED AND I FIND YOU ABANDONING YOURSELF TO NEW AMUSEMENTS
YES I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN QUITE HEROIC MY DEAR FRIEND WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE ABOUT SAID MANICAMP
I ASSURE YOU THAT ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME I HAD GOOD MUSCLES AND A SORT OF BRUTE COURAGE--I ASSURE YOU THAT THE FATHER DID ME SOME MISCHIEF
GOOD HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED WITH A TERROR HE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE IS DEAD NO SIRE SAID MONTALAIS IN A LOW VOICE
I SEEM TO KNOW THAT NAME SAID THE KING AS IF REFLECTING
IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE MONSIEUR SAID MONTALAIS TO MANICAMP
I HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE AND HAVE SENT HIM A LETTER IT WAS YOU THEN WHO WROTE TO HIM HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT BECAUSE HE TOLD ME SO
WITH YOU I WILL CHANGE MY CONDUCT AND CHARACTER
WAS IT NOT THE SAME WITH FOUQUET NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GENIUS AND HIS UPRIGHTNESS OF CONDUCT AS WITH THOSE CONQUERORS ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHO SHED TEARS WHEN THEY HAVE GAINED A VICTORY
THAT WOULD BE VERY SILLY
HE IS A VERY GOOD-NATURED FELLOW MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE CHEVALIER SUDDENLY AN EXCELLENT IDEA HAS STRUCK ME IN OUR CONVERSATION JUST NOW
FOUQUET WHO RETURNED HIS SALUTATION WITH KINDLY POLITENESS PERCEIVING THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAD RUN AGAINST HIM BY MISTAKE AND WITHOUT ANY INTENTION OF BEING RUDE
PERMIT ME MADAME TO KISS YOUR HANDS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HANDS IN FRANCE MAY YOU BE SUCCESSFUL SIRE AS THE FAMILY PEACEMAKER I DO NOT EMPLOY AN AMBASSADOR SAID LOUIS WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT I SHALL SUCCEED HE LAUGHED AS HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CARELESSLY ADJUSTED HIS RUFFLES AS HE WENT ALONG
JOHN BURSEY MORDAUNT@AOL.COM JUNE 2000 THERE IS ONE FRENCH CUSTOM THAT MAY CAUSE CONFUSION
THERE IS SOME ONE UNDER THE TREES YONDER WHO WILL BE ABLE TO INFORM YOU BETTER THAN MYSELF WHO ASKED FOUQUET WHOSE NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS PREVENTED HIM FROM SEEING THROUGH THE DARKNESS
I IMPLORE YOU SIRE NOT TO MAINTAIN TOWARDS ME THAT TERRIBLE SERIOUSNESS OF MANNER WHICH REVEALS YOUR MAJESTY'S JUST ANGER
ARAMIS BECAME YOUR SURETY LIKE A MAN OF HONOR
THE SWANS THEMSELVES EVEN REPOSING WITH FOLDED WINGS LIKE SHIPS AT ANCHOR SEEMED INSPIRATIONS OF THE WARMTH OF THE AIR THE FRESHNESS OF THE WATER AND THE SILENCE OF THE BEAUTIFUL EVENING
BUT IT DOES NOT MUCH MATTER SO WE WILL CONTINUE THE KING AT THIS OPENING COLORED VISIBLY AND SAINT-AIGNAN COMPLETELY LOSING COUNTENANCE BEGAN TO OPEN HIS EYES IN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ANXIETY
YOU HAVE CONTINUED THE UNKNOWN TRAVELER KEPT FOR ME IN ADDITION THE SMALL ROOM I ASKED FOR OH SAID MALICORNE ENDEAVORING TO HIDE HIMSELF
HE IS TRACTABLE
DO PEOPLE SAY THAT M
HE STARTED IN SPITE OF HIS COMMAND OVER HIMSELF AND A SLIGHT PALLOR OVERSPREAD HIS FACE
HIS LOOKS WERE OF THE MOST REASSURING CHARACTER
YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT NUMBER OF PERSONS ON SHORE WHO DID NOT VENTURE TO ACCOMPANY THEM
THEIR HEADS WERE BENT DOWN IN THE MANNER OF PEOPLE OCCUPIED WITH MATTERS OF GREAT MOMENT
IF YOU ARE SO EASILY EXCITED NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU ARE REALLY CAPTIVATED AND EVERY ONE WILL THINK YOU OUT OF YOUR SENSES--IF EVEN INDEED THE TRUTH ITSELF NOT BE GUESSED
BE CANDID AND TELL ME WHAT YOUR THOUGHT WAS--NO SECRETS BETWEEN FRIENDS TELL ME THEN MADAME WHY YOU HAVE BEEN SO HARSH THESE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS PAST HARSH YES
WITHOUT FALSEHOOD OR SUBTERFUGE LOUISE AM I TO BELIEVE WHAT MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS STATED
BUT IN SPITE OF THE DILIGENCE HE USED THE UNKNOWN HAD DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE FLIGHT OF STEPS BEFORE HE APPROACHED
IT IS EIGHT LONG DAYS SINCE I WAS HERE CHAPTER III
SHE HAS THE AIR THEREFORE RATHER OF A GODDESS THAN A MERE MORTAL AND AMONG THE GODDESSES SHE MOST RESEMBLES DIANA THE HUNTRESS
DE GUICHE'S CARRIAGE WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR AND TOOK THEM TO THE PALAIS ROYAL
HOWEVER ALMOST AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE COMPLETED HER INVESTIGATION MONSIEUR WAS ANNOUNCED
THE KING SEEMED EXCEEDINGLY PRESSED IN THREE DAYS WHEN I THINK RESUMED FOUQUET THAT JUST NOW AS I PASSED ALONG THE STREETS THE PEOPLE CRIED OUT THERE IS THE RICH MONSIEUR FOUQUET IT IS ENOUGH TO TURN MY BRAIN STAY MONSIEUR THE MATTER IS NOT WORTH SO MUCH TROUBLE SAID ARAMIS CALMLY SPRINKLING SOME SAND OVER THE LETTER HE HAD JUST WRITTEN
GENTLEMEN HE SAID WE MUST TAKE OUR LEAVE OF EACH OTHER I MUST PAY A VISIT TO MONSIEUR
ARAMIS PLACED HIS HAND UPON THE FRANCISCAN'S HEART BUT IT HAD CEASED TO BEAT
AT WHICH SUMMONS A MAN APPEARED
WELL SAID BAISEMEAUX AS THEY DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL I HAVE DISCOVERED THE SECRET MY DEAR GOVERNOR HE SAID
THERE IS LESS WORKMANSHIP IN THAT THAN IN THE OTHER
MY SWORD WAS NO LONGER THAN A PIECE OF STEEL
AND WHAT I SAY TO YOU I WOULD SAY TO DE GUICHE HIMSELF SO LITTLE DO I THINK OF THE ATTENTIONS HE PAYS MADAME
AND THIS INJURY HAS BEEN ATONED FOR BY A LONG AND LASTING REGRET
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER THE DOCTOR'S DEPARTURE THE CONFESSOR ARRIVED
FOR A MOMENT SHE REMAINED RIGID PALE AND MOTIONLESS AS A STATUE AND THEN LIKE A STATUE SHAKEN ON ITS BASE BY AN EARTHQUAKE TOTTERED AND FELL INANIMATE ON THE CARPET
A SORT OF COUNCIL OF WAR WAS HELD AND THE MEANS TO BE EMPLOYED FOR SAVING THE DIGNITY OF THE EMBASSY WERE DELIBERATED UPON
BUT THE KING DID NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT IT
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE IS WAITING FOR ME IN OUR ROOM TO COMMUNICATE SOMETHING OF THE VERY GREATEST IMPORTANCE HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN WAITING FOR AN HOUR AT LEAST IN THAT CASE SAID MALICORNE TRANQUILLY SHE CAN WAIT A FEW MINUTES LONGER MONSIEUR MALICORNE SAID MONTALAIS YOU ARE FORGETTING YOURSELF YOU SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT IT IS YOU WHO ARE FORGETTING ME AND THAT I AM GETTING IMPATIENT AT THE PART YOU MAKE ME PLAY HERE INDEED
YOU WHO HAVE A HEART AS I HAVE EYES AS I HAVE AND YET YOU SPEAK OF M
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU AT ALL SAY RATHER YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND ME YET EXPLAIN YOURSELF VERY WELL
HAND THEM ROUND FOR A WHILE FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE LADIES WHO SEEM TO HAVE AND WITH FAR GREATER RIGHT AN EXCUSE FOR UNDERSTANDING SUCH MATTERS THESE WORDS APPEARED TO MADAME THE COMMENCEMENT OF A DECISION SHE EXPECTED
SHE MOST LIKELY HOPED THAT THE KING WHO WAS FOLLOWING THE CARRIAGES OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR ON HORSEBACK WOULD NOT VENTURE TO FOLLOW THE MAIDS OF HONOR THEMSELVES ON FOOT
BUCKINGHAM FELT HIMSELF A PREY TO ALL THE TORTURES OF JEALOUSY
I WILL NOT LEAVE MY FRIEND DEAR MONTALAIS THAT IS RIGHT
AS SOON AS THE CROWD HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE SOUND OF THE HORSES AND CARRIAGES GREW FAINTER IN THE DISTANCE AND WHEN THEY WERE CERTAIN IN FACT THAT NO ONE COULD SEE THEM ARAMIS AND FOUQUET CAME OUT OF THEIR GROTTO AND BOTH OF THEM IN SILENCE PASSED SLOWLY ON TOWARDS THE WALK
I ADDRESS YOU AS A FRIEND
HE IS HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
JUST NOW I WAS DYING RESIGNEDLY FOR I HOPED
AND ORDER HIM TO WAIT FOR ME IN A CARRIAGE IN MADAME DE FAUCHEUX'S CARRIAGE SAID THE JEWELER
AND IN ORDER TO BEGIN WITH THE CURE OF THE OTHER I WILL THIS VERY DAY BEGIN TO LOOK OUT FOR A SUBJECT WHICH SHALL DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF THE JEALOUS MEMBERS OF EITHER SEX WHO PERSECUTE US BOTH HUSH
IT IS AGREED THEN THAT I CARRY YOU OFF WITH ME I SHALL BE AT YOUR COMMANDS
I HAVE MORE EXALTED AMBITION D'ARTAGNAN
OUR SYLVAN NYMPHS UTTERED A SLIGHT CRY BUT REASSURED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THEY LAUGHED AND RESUMED THEIR WALK
COME LET US DINE NOW MONSEIGNEUR TO-DAY IS A VERY FESTIVAL OF IDEAS
I MEAN THAT SHE WILL BE EVERYTHING YOUR MAJESTY MAY WISH HER TO BE THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM ASKING
DO NOT FORGET THE BASKET OF FRUIT WHICH YOU ARE TO OFFER TO POMONA COUNT REST ASSURED SAID DE GUICHE DELIGHTEDLY I SHALL FORGET NOTHING I AM NOW QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE WILL REMAIN MURMURED THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TO HIMSELF
SHE WAS THE PROTEGEE OF A MAN NAMED MALICORNE WHO IS A PROTEGEE OF MANICAMP'S
YOU WILL NOT BE ON DUTY UNTIL TO-MORROW
AND TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WOULD IN TWELVE YEARS AMOUNT TO ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS
RESPECT AND YET MORE A CERTAIN APPREHENSION FOR WHICH HE COULD NOT ACCOUNT HAD HITHERTO RESTRAINED THE COMTE DE GUICHE FROM LOOKING AT MADAME ATTENTIVELY WHO HOWEVER HAD OBSERVED HIM IMMEDIATELY AND HAD ASKED HER MOTHER IS NOT THAT MONSIEUR IN THE BOAT YONDER MADAME HENRIETTE WHO KNEW MONSIEUR BETTER THAN HER DAUGHTER DID SMILED AT THE MISTAKE HER VANITY HAD LED HER INTO AND HAD ANSWERED NO
BE CHARITABLE AND IF ON CLOSER INSPECTION YOU THINK YOU DO NOT LOVE HIM TELL HIM SO POOR FELLOW AND SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH
AND HER ATTENDANCE BEING REQUIRED UPON MADAME SHE TREMBLINGLY FOLLOWED THE PRINCESS WITHOUT THINKING OF TAKING THE GLOVES WHICH COURT ETIQUETTE REQUIRED HER TO DO
WE NEEDED OUR OWN GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE DO YOU THINK SO LET US NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES MONSEIGNEUR
COME FORGIVE THE POOR FELLOW FORGIVE HIM WHAT
DE GUICHE--WHOM BY THE BY I SHALL REGRET--I WARN YOU SIRE AH YOU WILL REGRET HIM CERTAINLY
IN HOW MANY DAYS DID YOU PROMISE THE FOUR MILLIONS IN THREE DAYS
COVERS THE YEARS 1625-1628
NO IT WOULD BE UNBECOMING FOR ME TO MAKE THE FIRST ADVANCE
LET IT BE UNDERSTOOD IN THAT MANNER IT IS AGREED THEN THAT SUCH SHALL BE THE TERMS WORD FOR WORD IT IS EXTRAORDINARY SAID MALICORNE TO HIMSELF
FAUCHEUX DO NOT DISTURB YOURSELF ABOUT THAT
DE WARDES SAID GUICHE TO MALICORNE WHO BOWED IN RETURN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WILL BE COMPLETELY PUT OUT OF COUNTENANCE
I GENERALLY TRAVEL AS FAST AS I CAN
DE GUICHE WHO CARRIED THEM TO MONSIEUR
DID YOU NOT FORBID ME TO VISIT YOU ALAS SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE SIGHING BECAUSE YOUR VISIT TO ME WAS THE CAUSE OF YOUR BEING VISITED WITH A GREAT MISFORTUNE
YOU DO NOT PERCEIVE I SAY THAT IT IS NO LONGER TO YOUR ONLY FRIEND THAT YOU CONFIDE YOUR PASSION BUT TO THE FIRST PERSON THAT APPROACHES YOU ARE YOU MAD BRAGELONNE EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE TO SAY SUCH A THING TO ME THE FACT STANDS THUS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE
HE FOUND THE COMTE DE GUICHE IN THE COURTYARD OF THE HOTEL GRAMMONT INSPECTING HIS HORSES WHICH HIS TRAINERS AND EQUERRIES WERE PASSING IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM
ALL OF WHICH SO PUFFED HIM UP THAT HE COULD HARDLY CONTAIN HIMSELF
THE WAY IS CLEAR ENOUGH YOU KNOW AND POOR MADAME DE SCUDERY WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME FOR PASSING THOUGH A HALTING-PLACE WITHOUT STOPPING OH
BUT THIS COFFER CONTAINS MY DOWRY IT IS YOUR RUIN EXCLAIMED FOUQUET TURNING OVER THE GOLD AND PAPERS
THE COMTE AS KNOWN AS A MAN OF EXTREME REFINEMENT AND AN ADMIRABLE NARRATOR
MALICORNE MOREOVER IT IS INCREDIBLE REPEATED THE OLD LADY
AS HE WITHDREW HE AGAIN TURNED ROUND BUT AT LAST AT THE END OF THE GRAND WALK IT WAS USELESS TO DO SO AGAIN AS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THEM
AH SIRE I ONLY NEEDED A SUSPICION FROM YOURSELF TO CROWN MY WRETCHEDNESS NO MADAME NO RETURNED THE KING HURRIEDLY
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE YOU CAN BE SUSPICIOUS OF MADAME NO NO CHEVALIER
IN WHOSE ABSENCE THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE OCCUPIED THAT OF DE GUICHE BY DE WARDES AND THAT OF RAOUL BY MANICAMP
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SOMETHING MADAME IS PRETTY CERTAINLY NO DOUBT OF IT YET NOT ALTOGETHER BEAUTIFUL NO BUT AS SHE GROWS OLDER SHE WILL PROBABLY BECOME STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL
THEY WERE NOT DRIVEN AWAY
AND YOU SEE I HAVE SELECTED THEM AS BEING EXPERIENCED IN AFFAIRS OF HONOR YOU DO NOT APPRECIATE MY DELICACY MONSIEUR
IT WAS PROBABLE THAT MADAME UNEASY AT THE KING HAVING LEFT HER HAD JUST GIVEN DIRECTIONS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS MANEUVER THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PROMENADE WAS TO TAKE PLACE HAVING BEEN LEFT TO HER
MADAME DE CHATILLON HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SET
THAT IS A VERY STRANGE EXPRESSION TO USE TO ME STILL REPLIED MADAME HENRIETTA SMILINGLY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY IN SUBMITTING TO THE WISHES OF SO GOOD A MOTHER ENOUGH I IMPLORE YOU
NOW INFORM ME COUNT SAID RAOUL FIXING A PENETRATING LOOK UPON HIM WHAT HAPPENED TO RENDER YOU SO CLEAR-SIGHTED GUICHE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ANSWERED SELF-LOVE I SUPPOSE SELF-LOVE IS A PEDANTIC WORD GUICHE WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT GENERALLY YOU ARE LESS OUT OF SPIRITS THAN SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THIS EVENING I AM FATIGUED LISTEN TO ME GUICHE
WHAT A FORTUNATE FELLOW THIS SAINT-AIGNAN IS TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF THE DRYADS SAID MONSIEUR
DE SAINT-AIGNAN OR M
EVERY ONE EXCLAIMED THE IMPETUOUS YOUNG MAN
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TURNED ON HIS HEEL BUT DE WARDES REMAINED AND WAITED
AND THE COMTE HIMSELF INFECTED BY THE GENERAL PANIC RETIRED TO HIS OWN ROOM
HEAVEN FORBID THEN SHE CONTINUED LANGUISHINGLY GRANT ME A FAVOR WHATEVER YOU WISH LET ME RETURN TO ENGLAND NEVER NEVER EXCLAIMED LOUIS XIV
AND I MY LORD HAVE ONLY THIS TO REPLY TO YOU
SHALL WE TAKE OFF OUR DOUBLETS AS YOU PLEASE MY LORD DO NOT HESITATE TO TELL ME M
BUT WHAT DOES THAT PROVE THAT MADAME HAS TWO ADMIRERS INSTEAD OF ONE YOU POISON THE SIMPLEST THING I POISON NOTHING
THAT A SMILE WAS SOMETIMES AS FULL OF MEANING AS A THREAT
IF YOU WILL ALLOW IT AND I WILL CALL FOR IT AT YOUR HOUSE CERTAINLY YOUR LADYSHIP I WILL DIRECT SOME OF MY SERVANTS TO CONVEY THE PLATE TO YOUR HOUSE THE MARQUISE RUNG
MONTALAIS LIFTED UP HER LITTLE DOUBLED FIST
HIS EYES SOUGHT HERS
I PERSIST THEN IN DRAWING THIS CONCLUSION
HOW CAN ONE PITY A MAN WHO BESTOWS HIS ATTENTIONS UPON SUCH A WOMAN AS MADAME
AN EXCELLENT AFFAIR NAY A BAD ONE AND FOR THIS REASON
I HOPE THAT YOU LOOK UPON YOURSELF AS ONE WHOSE CHANCES ARE GOOD AND THAT MY DREAM NOW BEGINS TO ASSURE THE SOLID OUTLINES OF REALITY YES INDEED
I WOULD HAVE WAITED IN ORDER TO RECEIVE ANY DIRECTIONS HE MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE ME IF THE DESIRE FOR MY IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE HAD NOT BEEN INTIMATED TO ME BY M
DE WARDES RESUMED RAOUL SUCH REMARKS ARE THE IDLEST BLUSTER
OF THE STATE OF THE AFFECTIONS OF EITHER OF THE TRAVELERS WITHOUT PRONOUNCING ANY NAME THAT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS
BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED DE GUICHE WITH HESITATING STEPS AND AN AIR OF CONTRITION ADMIRABLY ASSUMED
MY UNEASINESS IS VERY GREAT AND I WISH TO BE QUITE CERTAIN MYSELF THAT PROPER ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE AND THE KING LEFT AGAIN TO RETURN TO LA VALLIERE WHILE THOSE WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT COMMENTED UPON THE KING'S REMARK:--"MY UNEASINESS IS VERY GREAT CHAPTER XLIII
ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD ADOPTED THIS LINE OF CONDUCT ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE YOUNG QUEEN
I HEREBY ORDER THEM TO BE REMOVED A HOARSE AND ANGRY MURMUR RAN THROUGH THE CROWD OF LISTENERS AT THESE WORDS
THE KING AT THESE WORDS AT THIS VEHEMENT ENTREATY NO LONGER RETAINED ANY ILL-WILL OR DOUBT IN HIS MIND
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE VALUABLE COURTIERS WHOSE VIGILANCE AND ACUTENESS OF PERCEPTION THREW ALL OTHER FAVORITES INTO THE SHADE AND COUNTERBALANCED BY HIS CLOSE ATTENTION THE SERVILITY OF DANGEAU WHO WAS NOT THE FAVORITE BUT THE TOADY OF THE KING
LET US TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR BEING ALONE TO CROSS THE OPEN GROUND AND SO TAKE REFUGE IN THE WOODS SO MUCH THE BETTER SAID ATHENAIS BECAUSE I SEE THE TORCHES SETTING OUT FROM THE CHATEAU AND THE THEATER AND THEY SEEM AS IF THEY WERE PRECEDING SOME PERSON OF DISTINCTION LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE
IT IS TRUE LIEUTENANT-GENERALS AND BRIGADIERS PAY TWENTY-SIX FRANCS AND I HAVE TWO OF THEM
IT OWED ITS NAME TO ITS SIGN WHICH REPRESENTED A PEACOCK SPREADING ITS TAIL
DID YOU ENGAGE ONE MONSIEUR NO THEN I HAVE NO ROOMS TO LET IN THAT CASE I HAVE ENGAGED A ROOM SAID MANICAMP
THEY ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED AND UNDER M
I WILL ALLOW YOU TO RETAIN THIS INFORMATION
AND THE KING RESUMED ANSWERING COLBERT'S ICY SMILE FOUR MILLION FRANCS FOUR MILLION REPEATED FOUQUET BOWING PROFOUNDLY
THE KING FLUSHED AS IF MUCH ANNOYED
WHEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS IMPORTANT OCCUPATION THE NAME OF MANICAMP WAS ANNOUNCED
SAINT-AIGNAN THEN CONTINUED:--"IT IS NOT IN GAMES OF GLORY ONLY LADIES THAT THE SHEPHERD TYRCIS HAD ACQUIRED THAT REPUTATION BY WHICH HE WAS REGARDED AS THE KING OF THE SHEPHERDS OF THE SHEPHERDS OF FONTAINEBLEAU SAID THE KING SMILINGLY TO MADAME
SOME CHURCH DIGNITARY WHO THINKS HE HAS TO THANK ME FOR SOMETHING IS IT NOT PRECISELY SO SIRE
MADAME WAS FINISHING HER FIGURE
OF COURSE IT IS A QUESTION OF BUCKINGHAM OF WHOM ELSE COULD IT BE THEN
DE WARDES SEEMED TO GUESS WHAT WAS PASSING IN HIS MIND AND CONTINUED
YES REPLIED FOUQUET
BUT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY MAKE A WOMAN JEALOUS TOO HENRIETTA EXCLAIMED LOUIS YOU FILL MY HEART WITH JOY
I SUPPOSE SO FOR HE HAS NOT ASKED ME FOR ANY MORE BE EASY HE WILL ASK FOR SOME SOON NAY MORE THAN THAT I HAD THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT THE FETE AT VAUX BUT HE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT IT HE WILL BE SURE TO DO SO THOUGH YOU MUST THINK THE KING'S DISPOSITION A VERY CRUEL ONE MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY IT IS NOT HE WHO IS SO HE IS YOUNG AND THEREFORE HIS DISPOSITION IS A KIND ONE HE IS YOUNG AND EITHER HE IS WEAK OR HIS PASSIONS ARE STRONG
IT IS EVEN SAID THAT THE MUSES CONDESCENDED TO SMILE UPON HIM AT HIS BIRTH EVEN AS HEBE SMILED UPON YOUTH
FOR IF WHAT YOU SAY BE TRUE OF THE ACCOMMODATING DISPOSITION OF THIS GIRL FOR THE KING AND MADAME THE KING WILL GIVE HER ALL THE MONEY SHE CAN ASK FOR THE KING HAS MONEY THEN ASKED ARAMIS
HE READ ON HIS ENTRANCE DEVOURING HUMILIATION ON THE COUNTENANCE OF COLBERT
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS MANNER HOW MISERABLE ALL THIS IS SAID THE CHEVALIER
YES SIRE AND I KEPT THAT NEWS FOR THE LAST FOR IT IS SAD AND WILL CLOTHE EUROPEAN ROYALTY IN MOURNING WHAT DO YOU TELL ME SIRE IN PASSING THROUGH BLOIS A WORD A SAD WORD ECHOED FROM THE PALACE STRUCK MY EAR IN TRUTH YOU TERRIFY ME M
IF YOU WERE REALLY IGNORANT OF THE CAUSE OF YOUR DETENTION YOU WOULD BE FURIOUS I WAS SO DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF MY IMPRISONMENT WHY ARE YOU NOT SO NOW BECAUSE I HAVE REFLECTED THAT IS STRANGE SAID ARAMIS
MY WORDS MAY BE OVERHEARD BY SOME LISTENER OR PERHAPS BY AN ENEMY
NOW MIND IF YOU PERSIST IN THIS BAD HABIT OF LAUGHING AT PEOPLE I WILL HAVE YOU TURNED OUT OH YES FOR REALLY YOU EXASPERATE ME THERE THERE
HIS AFFIRMED WIFE IS OF GOOD BIRTH BUT HAS NO FORTUNE THAT IS A MISFORTUNE WE CAN REMEDY YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH GRATITUDE SIRE
THE VERSES IN THIS CHAPTER HAVE BEEN RE-WRITTEN TO GIVE THE FLAVOR OF THEM RATHER THAN THE MEANING
HAD YOU INDEED DISAPPEARED AS EVERY ONE ASSURED ME YES MONSEIGNEUR A CAPRICE I TO VENTURE UPON CAPRICES WITH YOUR HIGHNESS
THANK YOU THANK YOU EXCLAIMED MADAME
FIVE HUNDRED PISTOLES I SAY IT IS FOR NOTHING MY FRIEND SAID MANICAMP TAKING UP THE PEN AGAIN AND YOU EXHAUST MY CREDIT
DO YOU ASK A MOTHER TO SACRIFICE HER SON,--A QUEEN TO CONSENT TO THE DISHONOR OF HER HOUSE
FOUQUET WAS ABOUT TO THROW HIMSELF UPON HIS KNEES
YOU HAVE DRIVEN THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AWAY
HE DOES NOT LOVE HER THEN DE GUICHE PRONOUNCED THE LATTER WITH SO MARKED AN EXPRESSION THAT RAOUL RAISED HIS HEAD
THE KING HAS BEEN INDUCED TO SIGN THAT IT IS MONSTROUS INCREDIBLE SUCH IS THE FACT HOWEVER I DO INDEED PITY YOU BAISEMEAUX
AS FOR SAINT-AIGNAN HE CARRIED OFF MALICORNE WITH HIM TO HIS APARTMENTS SHOWING HIM A THOUSAND ATTENTIONS ENCHANTED TO HAVE SO CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TWO MEN WHO EVEN SUPPOSING DE GUICHE WERE TO REMAIN SILENT COULD GIVE HIM THE BEST INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAIDS OF HONOR
SONGS ARE WRITTEN ABOUT EVERYTHING DO YOU KNOW IT NO
I ALL THE GENTLEMEN ABOUT ME GOOD-LOOKING
MY IGNORANCE THEREFORE OF MY MOTHER'S NAME IS A MISFORTUNE FOR ME AND NOT A REPROACH
YOU HERE RAOUL SAID DE GUICHE
YES WE WILL DIGEST THE AFFRONT SIRE REPLIED THE COURTIER WITH RESIGNATION
WHAT AM I COMPARED TO YOU AND WHY SHOULD YOU EVEN TROUBLE YOURSELF TO KNOW WHETHER I EXIST OR NOT MONSIEUR DE GUICHE BOTH YOU AND I ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND KNOWING YOU AS I DO I DO NOT WISH YOU TO RISK YOUR LIFE
THERE IS NOT I REPEAT SO VERY WIDE A DISTANCE THAT MY DREAM CAN BE PRONOUNCED FALSE ON THAT ACCOUNT
DE GUICHE REMAIN HERE
I DO REGRET AND SHALL ALWAYS REGRET MY HUSBAND
SIT DOWN THERE MY FATHER HE SAID AND LISTEN TO ME THE JESUIT CONFESSOR A GOOD PRIEST A RECENTLY INITIATED MEMBER OF THE ORDER WHO HAD MERELY SEEN THE BEGINNING OF ITS MYSTERIES YIELDED TO THE SUPERIORITY ASSUMED BY THE PENITENT
FOR HER THIS FUGITIVE THIS EXILE WAS NOW SIMPLY A REMEMBRANCE NO LONGER A MAN
2 CHAPTER XX
WELL I ASSURE YOU THAT I WILL CONSCIENTIOUSLY SET ABOUT MY INQUIRIES
HE RETAINED HER HAND IN HIS AND IN ORDER TO PRESS IT WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION IN THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE NOT SO MUCH TAKEN UP WITH THE BUTTERFLIES THAT THEY COULD NOT OCCUPY THEMSELVES ABOUT OTHER MATTERS AND WHO PERCEIVED CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT THERE WAS SOME MYSTERY IN THE KING'S AND MADAME'S CONVERSATION LOUIS PLACED THE DYING BUTTERFLY BEFORE HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AND BENT OVER IT AS IF TO COUNT THE THOUSAND EYES OF ITS WINGS OR THE PARTICLES OF GOLDEN DUST WHICH COVERED IT
THE CURRENT OF FRESH AIR PRODUCED BY THE RAPID MOTION OF THE CARRIAGE SOON RECALLED HER TO HER SENSES
WHY HE PRETENDS CONTINUED THE PRINCE THAT MADEMOISELLE HENRIETTA IS BETTER LOOKING AS A WOMAN THAN I AM AS A MAN DO NOT FORGET MY LORD SAID DE GUICHE FROWNING SLIGHTLY YOU REQUIRE ME TO SPEAK THE TRUTH CERTAINLY SAID THE PRINCE TREMBLINGLY
COME HERE MY DEAR RAOUL
MOREOVER SHE WISHED HIM TO LEARN THAT IN A WAR OF THAT DESCRIPTION KINGS ARE HELD OF NO ACCOUNT OR AT ALL EVENTS THAT KINGS WHO FIGHT ON THEIR OWN BEHALF LIKE ORDINARY INDIVIDUALS MAY WITNESS THE FALL OF THEIR CROWN IN THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
FOUQUET HAS JUST TOLD US THAT HE HAD PRESENTED IT TO THE KING SAID BUCKINGHAM
JUST IMAGINE THEN MY GOOD LOUISE THE MISCHIEF THAT SUCH A MELANCHOLY WOULD CREATE IN ANYBODY'S BRAIN,--A MELANCHOLY I MEAN OF THAT KIND
THE SEA WAS GILDED WITH THE SAME REFLECTION AND UPON THE CREST OF EVERY SPARKLING WAVE DANCED A POINT OF LIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND BY LAMPLIGHT
THIS SPRING WAS NOT ONLY THE MAYTIDE OF NATURE IT WAS THE YOUTH OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE OF WHICH THOSE AT COURT WERE THE HEAD
ON THE CONTRARY I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE MOST HAPPY IF SHE CAME THERE BUT IT APPEARS THAT M
DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT HE IS IN LOVE WITH MADAME SO IT IS SAID VERY WELL
A LOVER AND HIS MISTRESS
AND THAT YOU KNEW M
BUT NOW I ENTREAT YOU LEAVE ME TO MYSELF DO YOU WISH IT YES
MALICORNE WITH PERFECT EASE ARRANGED THE BRIDLE AND SNAFFLE-REINS PLACED HIS LEFT HAND ON THE HORSE'S MANE AND WITH HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP RAISED HIMSELF AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE SADDLE
DO YOU THINK THAT I CARE FOR M
SHE DIVINED A NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT SLEEP A DAY PASSED IN DECEPTIONS
MALICORNE HAD DETERMINED TO RISE AT WHATEVER PRICE IT MIGHT COST AND FOR THIS WHATEVER PRICE IT DID COST HE HAD GIVEN HIMSELF A MISTRESS AND A FRIEND
BUT UNTIL IT IS CLEARED UP I SHALL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHICH IS THE BEST THING I CAN POSSIBLY DO AND HE DARTED OUT OF HIS ROOM LIKE A HUNTING-DOG FOLLOWING A SCENT IN SEARCH OF ALL THE NEWS AND CURIOSITIES OF THE COURT GETTING HIMSELF BURNT IN ONE PLACE AND DROWNED IN ANOTHER AS HE HAD TOLD MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS
BUT TELL ME DOES M
THE KING HAVING SENT TO INQUIRE WHAT HER OBJECT WAS IN STOPPING THE CAVALCADE WAS INFORMED IN REPLY THAT SHE WISHED TO WALK
MOREOVER MADAME HAS SHUT UP HER MAIDS OF HONOR IN ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE TIME TO CONCERT ANY MEASURES TOGETHER AND THIS MORNING SHE WAS CLOSETED WITH TONNAY-CHARENTE WITH THE SAME OBJECT
EXTRAORDINARY DEVOTION REALLY TO TRAVEL A HUNDRED LEAGUES IN COMPANY WITH A WOMAN ONE IS IN LOVE WITH IN LOVE PHILIP
THE DEVIL!--WE NEVER SO MUCH AS GAVE IT A THOUGHT ALAS
THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE TEN YEARS LATER LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE AND THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
COME AND SEE MY NEW PLANTATIONS RAOUL THE YOUNG MAN KNEW VERY WELL THAT AFTER THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FATHER'S WISH NO OPPORTUNITY OF DISCUSSION WAS LEFT HIM
WELL ASKED MALICORNE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY TO HAVE THE LETTER FROM THE COMTE DE GUICHE FOR MONSIEUR I HAVE WON MY WAGER HOW THE DEVIL IS THAT THAT IS TRANSPARENT ENOUGH I THINK
AT THE NOISE MADE BY BUCKINGHAM MANICAMP WHO WAS INDOLENTLY RECLINING UPON THE CUSHIONS AT THE DOORWAY OF ONE OF THE TENTS ROSE WITH HIS USUAL INDIFFERENCE AND PERCEIVING THAT THE DISTURBANCE CONTINUED MADE HIS APPEARANCE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CURTAINS
I AM OBLIGED TO CONFESS HE SAID AFTER THIS DENIAL THAT YOUR HEART IS THE MOST DELICATE IN THE WORLD AND I SHOULD NOT FEEL I WAS A MAN OF HONOR AND UPRIGHTNESS IF I WERE TO SUSPECT ANYTHING FROM A WOMAN SO GENEROUS AS YOURSELF REALLY MONSIEUR FOUQUET REPLIED LA VALLIERE IT IS WITH PROFOUND REGRET I AM OBLIGED TO REPEAT THAT I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU REFER TO IN FACT THEN UPON YOUR HONOR MADEMOISELLE YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY LETTER FROM ME UPON MY HONOR NONE REPLIED LA VALLIERE FIRMLY
AN EXCELLENT ONE IF MONSIEUR IS NOT ANGRY WITH YOU
THE RESULT WAS THAT AFTER HAVING FULLY DELIBERATED UPON THE MATTER DE WARDES PACKED UP HIS LUGGAGE TOOK A COUPLE OF HORSES AND FOLLOWED ONLY BY ONE SERVANT MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE BARRIER WHERE BUCKINGHAM'S CARRIAGE WAS TO AWAIT HIM
BUT HE PRETENDED THAT PEOPLE REASSURE HIM TOO OFTEN AND THAT HE HAD HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF IT WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FOR HIM NOT TO MAKE HIMSELF UNEASY IN ANY WAY THE VERY THING I SAID CONFESS SIRE THAT THE WORLD IS VERY WICKED
IT IS THUS THAT WE ACT YOUR GRACE
MONSIEUR HOWEVER KNEW THE PEOPLE HE HAD TO DEAL WITH TOO WELL AND WAS NATURALLY TOO POLITE TO REMAIN SILENT AND HE ACCORDINGLY SALUTED THEM
HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS EVERYBODY IN FONTAINEBLEAU KNEW THAT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE HAD HAD A CONVERSATION UNDER THE ROYAL OAK WITH MONTALAIS AND TONNAY-CHARENTE AND THAT IN THIS CONVERSATION SHE HAD CONFESSED HER AFFECTION FOR THE KING
FOR THE DRYAD WHOSE STORY IS ENGAGING OUR ATTENTION LIVES IN THE PARK BELONGING TO THE CHATEAU OF HIS MAJESTY THE AFFAIR WAS FAIRLY EMBARKED ON
TO SHOW ANIMOSITY AGAINST WOMEN--HUMILIATION
THE REVENUES OF THE STATE INCREASED
THE KING HAD JUST TIME TO HOLD OUT HIS ARM
FOUQUET BOWED AND LEFT
MENACED SAID FOUQUET YOU DO NOT PLACE THIS GNAT BITE AS IT WERE AMONG THE NUMBER OF MENACES WHICH MAY COMPROMISE MY FORTUNE AND MY LIFE DO YOU DO NOT FORGET MONSIEUR FOUQUET THAT THE BIT OF AN INSECT CAN KILL A GIANT IF THE INSECT BE VENOMOUS BUT HAS THIS SOVEREIGN POWER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF ALREADY VANISHED I AM ALL-POWERFUL IT IS TRUE BUT I AM NOT IMMORTAL COME THEN THE MOST PRESSING MATTER IS TO FIND TOBY AGAIN I SUPPOSE
I DON'T REMEMBER NOW REPLIED LOUIS XIV ENDEAVORING TO CONCEAL AN ANNOYANCE HE HAD SOME TROUBLE TO DISGUISE
I REGRET TO CONFESS IT REPEATED THE KING BOWING COLDLY
YOU LAUGH SAID FOUQUET
IN THAT CASE THE INTENDED WAS M
WELL AS FAR AS THAT GOES I DO NOT SAY IT WAS NOT THE CASE
HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE KING WITH THAT GRACIOUS KINDNESS OF MANNER WHICH LOUIS WITH A TACT BEYOND HIS YEARS RESERVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF GAINING THOSE WHO WERE NOT TO BE CONQUERED BY ORDINARY FAVORS
WELL LISTEN ANNE OF AUSTRIA PREPARED HERSELF TO LISTEN WITH THAT LOVE OF GOSSIP WHICH THE BEST WOMAN LIVING AND THE BEST MOTHER WERE SHE A QUEEN EVEN ALWAYS FINDS IN BEING MIXED UP WITH THE PETTY SQUABBLES OF A HOUSEHOLD
INDEED I ONLY REMEMBER VERY INDISTINCTLY THAT ONE OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR WAS TO MARRY--THE NAME HOWEVER HAS ESCAPED ME WAS IT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE HE WAS GOING TO MARRY INQUIRED SAINT-AIGNAN
IN WISHING TO PROVE EVERYTHING YOU PROVE NOTHING THE PRINCE BEWILDERED BY HIS MOTHER'S SERIOUS MANNER WISHED TO REPLY BUT HE COULD ONLY STAMMER OUT SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
BUT THE ROOM LOOK SAID THE TRAVELER POINTING TOWARDS A SORT OF PROCESSION WHICH WAS APPROACHING
COMTE DO NOT I ENTREAT YOU SACRIFICE POOR AMYNTAS
YOU HAVE BEEN AS SILLY AS MYSELF I THINK SIRE STAMMERED OUT SAINT-AIGNAN
HE NEVER DOES THAT HE WILL BE ASKING QUESTIONS HE SEES NO ONE AT ALL EVENTS HE IS LOOKING OR HOPING FOR SOMETHING OR ANOTHER I HAVE INSPIRED IN HIM A HOPE WHICH WE WILL REALIZE SOME FINE MORNING AND ON THAT HE SUBSISTS WHAT IS IT THAT OF BEING PRESENTED TO THE KING OH
THE KING REMAINED FOR A MOMENT TO ENJOY A TRIUMPH AS COMPLETE AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE
BUT YOUR MAJESTY WILL PERMIT ME TO OFFER A REMARK DO SO COMTE YOUR MAJESTY SEEMS TO INTIMATE AN INTENTION OF GIVING A MARRIAGE-PORTION TO THIS YOUNG LADY CERTAINLY I SHOULD REGRET SIRE IF THE STEP I HAVE TAKEN TOWARDS YOUR MAJESTY SHOULD BE ATTENDED BY THIS RESULT NO FALSE DELICACY COMTE
IT IS THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM SAID MARGUERITE BURSTING INTO LAUGHTER
YES MADAME
YES MADAME
YES MADAME
THEN YOU GAIN SEVEN FRANCS AND A HALF UPON THOSE WHO PAY YOU FIFTEEN FRANCS I MUST COMPENSATE MYSELF SOMEHOW SAID BAISEMEAUX WHO SAW HOW HE HAD BEEN SNAPPED UP
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN SUBJECTS WHICH ARE ONLY APPROACHED WITH HESITATION IF THAT HESITATION IN YOUR CASE REALLY DOES EXIST I ENTREAT YOU TO OVERCOME IT EVEN IF IT REFER TO A DISGRACEFUL ACTION YES
WHAT MELANCHOLY THOUGHT SAID THE KING CAN POSSIBLY REACH YOUR HEART WHEN I PLACE MINE AS A RAMPART BEFORE IT I WILL TELL YOU SIRE
THEY WERE COVERED WITH THE RICHEST STUFFS AND DESTINED FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH NOBILITY TOWARDS THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
VINCENNES IS CLOSE TO THE BASTILE THE CONSEQUENCES CONCERN ME BUT THE MOTIVE FOR THIS MEETING
YOU REQUIRE MY FORMAL CONSENT AND YOU HAVE IT
AS YOU THEREFORE ARE STAYING AT FONTAINEBLEAU AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I HAVE COME TO FONTAINEBLEAU MONTALAIS SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
I WILL NOT INSIST
MERE PRETEXTS REALLY M
EXPLAIN YOURSELF YOU WILL SOON LEARN
AND BEING WELL READ IN THE HEARTS OF KINGS IN GENERAL AND IN THOSE OF POWERFUL KINGS IN PARTICULAR HE BEGAN TO ASK HIMSELF IF THIS WEIGHT OF ANGER AS YET HELD IN SUSPENSE WOULD NOT SOON TERMINATE BY FALLING UPON HIS OWN HEAD FOR THE VERY REASON THAT OTHERS WERE GUILTY AND HE INNOCENT
DO NOT LEAVE US RAOUL
MADAME NOTWITHSTANDING THE BOLD CONFIDENCE WHICH HER WIT AND BEAUTY INSPIRED HER BLINDLY RAN HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE NET THUS STRETCHED OUT TO CATCH HER
I MUST SPEAK TO LOUISE AND AT THE SAME TIME A SOFT PRESSURE OF THE HAND RECOMPENSED MALICORNE FOR HIS FUTURE OBEDIENCE
BUT LOUIS WAS NO LONGER IN HIS APPRENTICESHIP
THEN RECEIVING FROM THE HANDS OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA AMID THE EAGER DESIRE OF THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY THE CASKET INCLOSING THE BRACELETS HE SAID ARE THESE BRACELETS REALLY BEAUTIFUL THEN LOOK AT THEM SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF THE KING LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID YES INDEED AN ADMIRABLE MEDALLION
I HAVE PROLONGED IT AT THE RISK OF DISPLEASING MY GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN
WELL THEN YOU HAVE IMPLORED THIS LOVE ON YOUR KNEES AND I HAVE REFUSED YOU
AFTERWARDS FIVE OR SIX OTHERS ARRIVE UNEXPECTEDLY HIS ANGER IS AROUSED AND HE PERSISTS
IT WAS WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER A GENERAL DEVASTATION
IT MAY BE DANGEROUS FOR HER WHEN IN AN INTERESTING CONDITION THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE BURST OUT LAUGHING
UNHAPPY WRETCHED MAN HE MURMURED
IT IS TRUE THEN THAT YOU WERE IN WANT OF MONEY SINCE YOU WERE GOING TO A PERSON WHO GIVES IT AWAY I ASSURE YOU MY LORD YOU WERE AFRAID MY DEAR LORD IT WAS THE UNCERTAINTY AND IGNORANCE IN WHICH I WAS AS TO WHERE YOU WERE TO BE FOUND YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND THE MONEY YOU REQUIRE AT M
AFTER HAVING SALUTED RAOUL MOST GRACEFULLY HE SAID
HIS DRESS THROWN UPON THE BED WAS OF RICH BLACK VELVET AND HE INHALED THE FRESH AIR WHICH BLEW IN UPON HIS BREAST THROUGH A SHIRT OF THE VERY FINEST CAMBRIC
CAN YOU WALK SAID BUCKINGHAM SUPPORTING HIM ON HIS KNEE
AND AS THERE ARE NO LIONS IN THE PARK IT IS NOT UNLIKELY WE SHALL FIND HIM ALIVE
BUT YOU WISH TO KNOW ITS DESTINATION NAY NAY CHEVALIER I NEED NO EXPLANATION TO-MORROW IS THE FIRST OF JUNE WELL ONE OF OUR BONDS BECOMES DUE I DID NOT KNOW WE HAD ANY BONDS CERTAINLY TO-MORROW WE PAY OUR LAST THIRD INSTALMENT WHAT THIRD OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS TO BAISEMEAUX BAISEMEAUX
THE ONE WILL ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE PRODIGAL WITH YOUR TREASURES--AND THIS SHALL BE MYSELF IF MY SERVICES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY
BUT AT LAST I WAKE AND LEAVE IT
COME TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HARDLY HAD HE FINISHED READING IT WHEN A SERVANT IN THE LIVERY OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TURNING OUT OF THE GALLERY RECOGNIZED RAOUL AND APPROACHED HIM RESPECTFULLY SAYING FROM HIS GRACE MONSIEUR WELL RAOUL AS I SEE YOU ARE ALREADY AS BUSY AS A GENERAL OF AN ARMY I SHALL LEAVE YOU AND WILL FIND M
FROM ONE OF THESE GROUPS THE NEAREST TO THE FIREPLACE MALICORNE WHO HAD BEEN AT ONCE RAISED TO THE DIGNITY THROUGH MANICAMP AND DE GUICHE OF THE POST OF MASTER OF THE APARTMENTS AND WHOSE OFFICIAL COSTUME HAD BEEN READY FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS WAS BRILLIANT WITH GOLD LACE AND SHONE UPON MONTALAIS STANDING ON MADAME'S EXTREME LEFT WITH ALL THE FIRE OF HIS EYES AND SPLENDOR OF HIS VELVET
D'ARTAGNAN DOES HE PARTAKE OF YOUR REPENTANCE MY COMPANION YES YOU WERE NOT ALONE I HAVE BEEN TOLD ALONE WHERE AT THE PLACE DE GREVE NO SIRE NO SAID D'ARTAGNAN BLUSHING AT THE IDEA THAT THE KING MIGHT HAVE A SUSPICION THAT HE D'ARTAGNAN HAD WISHED TO ENGROSS TO HIMSELF ALL THE GLORY THAT BELONGED TO RAOUL
WHY IN FACT HAD MADAME WHOSE EYES AND MIND WERE SOUGHT FOR IN ANOTHER DIRECTION SHOWN DURING THE LAST WEEK TOWARDS THE KING A SEMBLANCE OF FAVOR WHICH ENCOURAGED THE BELIEF OF STILL GREATER REGARD
WAS HATLESS HE HAD STRUCK DOWN WITH HIS CANE A PEACOCK BUTTERFLY WHICH MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN HAD PICKED UP FROM THE GROUND QUITE STUNNED
MONTALAIS REQUIRED NOTHING TO MAKE HER RESEMBLANCE TO A DRYAD AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE
AT THE END OF A FEW PACES HOWEVER THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO DISOBEY HIS MOTHER'S INJUNCTIONS
BAISEMEAUX THEN ENTERED WHILE ARAMIS REMAINED AT THE THRESHOLD FROM WHICH PLACE HE SAW A YOUTH ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHO RAISING HIS HEAD AT THE UNUSUAL NOISE JUMPED OFF THE BED AS HE PERCEIVED THE GOVERNOR AND CLASPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER BEGAN TO CRY OUT MY MOTHER MY MOTHER IN TONES WHICH BETRAYED SUCH DEEP DISTRESS THAT ARAMIS DESPITE HIS COMMAND OVER HIMSELF FELT A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH HIS FRAME
I WILL SAY NO MORE
HER TIMID AND INDECISIVE MIND WAS DISPLAYED IN BRILLIANT FLASHES OF WIT AND HUMOR
IF HOWEVER FOR YOUR SAKE I SACRIFICE A PREJUDICE DO YOU FOR MINE SACRIFICE A SCRUPLE DO NOT TEMPT ME DO NOT REFUSE ME THINK SERIOUSLY OF WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING FOUQUET BUT ONE WORD
THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO--NEITHER REPROACHES NOR EXILE--NOR COULD HE EVEN SHOW THE ANNOYANCE HE FELT
HE PLACED UPON THE TABLE THE PROVISIONS WHICH THE KIND-HEARTED GOVERNOR CALLED DAINTIES AND THEN LEFT THE ROOM
AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET THE KING FELT HIMSELF COLOR DEEPLY AND SAID YOU ARE PROBABLY MISTAKEN SO LITTLE IS THAT THE CASE SIRE THAT IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL LOOK TO THE RIGHT YOU WILL SEE THAT THE COMTE IS IN WAITING LOUIS TURNED HASTILY TOWARDS THE SIDE AND IN FACT ON HIS RIGHT BRILLIANT IN HIS CHARACTER OF AUTUMN DE GUICHE AWAITED UNTIL THE KING SHOULD LOOK AT HIM IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ADDRESS HIM
I WISH YOU TO BE DISTINGUISHED BY THE SPLENDOR WHICH GLORY AND FORTUNE CONFER FOR NOBILITY OF DESCENT YOU HAVE ALREADY MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED RAOUL CARRIED AWAY BY A FIRST IMPULSE
HE PERMITTED THEM THEREFORE TO MAKE CERTAIN EXTRAVAGANT CONDITIONS FOR THEIR RETIREMENT WHAT WERE THOSE CONDITIONS TREMBLE
AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE ABOUT TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD A YOUNG MAN APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE
I DO NOT WISH TO KNOW WHAT SHE IS TO-DAY OR WHAT SHE WILL BE TO-MORROW
FOR I AM TOLD YOU HAVE ARRIVED FROM BLOIS
SOME OF THE SOLDIERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN THE COURTYARD DREW THEMSELVES UP IN A LINE AS STIFF AS POSTS AS THE GOVERNOR PASSED ALONG
DE BRAGELONNE AND THAT OTHER MADLY-IN-LOVE FOOL THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ME CHAPTER XLV
OF COURSE VERY WELL YOU HAVE SEEN ME,--YOU ARE SATISFIED
BUT GALATEA THE GENTLE AND SOFT-EYED GALATEA IMMEDIATELY REPLIED THAT NEITHER AMYNTAS NOR ALPHESIBOEUS NOR TITYRUS NOR INDEED ANY OF THE HANDSOMEST SHEPHERDS OF THE COUNTRY WERE TO BE COMPARED TO TYRCIS
INDEED I AM NOW SETTING OUT
THEREFORE LET US COME TO A PROPER UNDERSTANDING YES INDEED SAID MONTALAIS AND I AM LISTENING IN BREATHLESS ATTENTION GRACIOUS HEAVENS MURMURED LOUISE TREMBLING SHALL I EVER SURVIVE THIS CRUEL EVENING OH
THE CONSEQUENCE IS CONTINUED THE CARDINAL THAT THE PEACE AND ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO KINGDOMS DEPEND UPON THE OBSERVANCE OF THAT CLAUSE OF THE CONTRACT A SIMILAR SIGN FROM THE FRANCISCAN
TYRCIS WAS YOUNG AND HANDSOME AND FROM HIS MANY QUALIFICATIONS HE MIGHT BE PRONOUNCED TO BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST AMONG THE SHEPHERDS IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY
WELL SHE SAID ASCENDING ANOTHER ROUND OF THE LADDER ARE YOU RESOLVED TO RENDER ME UNHAPPY
AND I SHALL BE WITH THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM IN AN HOUR HE ADDED DISMISSING WITH THESE WORDS THE DUKE'S MESSENGER
TO THE POINT SAID THE FRANCISCAN IN A FAINT VOICE SHOWING THE CARDINAL A LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN TO THE GRAND COUNCIL
WELL SAID DE WARDES FURIOUSLY IT IS NOW YOUR TURN AND WITH A TERRIBLE LUNGE HE PIERCED BUCKINGHAM'S ARM THE SWORD PASSING BETWEEN THE TWO BONES
YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID OPENING THE PAPER WHICH HE HAD NOT YET READ
AT PRESENT THE MOST WORTHLESS OF MEN IS BETTER THAN I AM
WHY THE VERY IDEA OF THE SOUND OF THE BOLTS MAKES ME SHUDDER
TO WHOM DO YOU TELL THAT
THE POOR GIRL FELT THE KING'S ARDENT LOOK FIXED UPON HER,--SHE DARED NOT DENY--SHE DARED NOT TELL A FALSEHOOD
YOU REFUSE WHAT I OUGHT AND WHAT I WISH TO DO FOR YOU ALL I DESIRED HAS BEEN GRANTED ME WHEN THE HONOR WAS CONFERRED UPON ME OF FORMING ONE OF MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD BUT IF YOU REFUSE FOR YOURSELF AT LEAST ACCEPT FOR YOUR FAMILY YOUR GENEROUS INTENTIONS SIRE BEWILDER ME AND MAKE ME APPREHENSIVE FOR IN DOING FOR MY FAMILY WHAT YOUR KINDNESS URGES YOU TO DO YOUR MAJESTY WILL RAISE UP ENEMIES FOR US AND ENEMIES FOR YOURSELF TOO
DE GUICHE REFLECTED FOR AWHILE AND THEN SAID ALOUD LET HIM WHO LOVES ME FOLLOW ME THE ATTENDANTS ALSO INQUIRED A PAGE WHO HAD APPROACHED THE GROUP
IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISORDER THE COMTE DE GUICHE FANCIED HE RECOGNIZED MANICAMP
THE LOOK AND THE KING'S REMARK SUCCEEDED IN OVERPOWERING THE UNHAPPY GIRL WHO WITH HER HEAD UPON MONTALAIS'S SHOULDER SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY
AS FOR SAINT-AIGNAN HE DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DISSEMBLE HIS DESPAIR AND HARDLY KNOWING WHAT HE SAID HE STAMMERED OUT AN EXCELLENT JEST
THE APPROACH OF THE STORM COULD BE FELT BUT AS THE KING DID NOT PERCEIVE IT NO ONE THOUGHT IT PROPER TO DO SO
IT VERY RARELY HAPPENS THAT THERE IS NOT ALWAYS SOME ONE PRESENT TO HEAR ESPECIALLY THE VERY THINGS WHICH OUGHT NOT TO BE HEARD DE GUICHE UTTERED A DEEP SIGH
TRUE YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD I SUPPOSE THAT SOME ONE WAS TO BE ARRESTED AND HAVE COME YOURSELF INSTEAD OF SENDING AN OFFICER I CAME BECAUSE I HAD OCCASION TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU DID NOT SEND TO ME I WAITED UNTIL YOU WERE DISENGAGED SAID MONSIEUR BAISEMEAUX TIMIDLY
THANK YOU SHE SAID LAUGHING IN A CONVULSIVE MANNER YOU RELATE STORIES DELIGHTFULLY M
THE HORSES HAD BEEN EMBARKED HAVING BEEN HOISTED FROM THE BOAT UPON THE DECK IN BASKETS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR THE PURPOSE AND WADDED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THEIR LIMBS EVEN IN THE MOST VIOLENT FITS OF TERROR OR IMPATIENCE WERE ALWAYS PROTECTED BY THE SOFT SUPPORT WHICH THE SIDES AFFORDED AND THEIR COATS NOT EVEN TURNED
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IN SHORT VOYAGES HORSES REFUSE TO EAT BUT REMAIN TREMBLING ALL THE WHILE WITH THE BEST OF FOOD BEFORE THEM SUCH AS THEY WOULD HAVE GREATLY COVETED ON LAND
OF MANICAMP'S CONVERSATION WITH MONTALAIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE SIRE I WAS DEPRIVED OF THE PRESENCE OF MY BROTHER'S FRIEND
IT IS NOT EVERY ONE WHO TAKES HER FANCY MONSEIGNEUR NO RESISTANCE DE GUICHE OR I SHALL GET OUT OF TEMPER REPLIED THE PRINCE
MONSIEUR HAD HIS MOST ENGAGING SMILE ON HIS RED AND PERFUMED LIPS
THE NEW GENERAL OF THE JESUITS
MONSIEUR HE SAID THE COURIER HAS ARRIVED VERY WELL SAID THE CHEVALIER THERE IS TIME ENOUGH
THE FIRE WAS BURNING UPON THE HEARTH
THIS NOTE MONSIEUR
AND SHE STOOPED TO GATHER A FLOWER FROM THE THICK GRASS AT HER FEET
EVERY INGOT IS CONCEALED BY A COATING OF CHOCOLATE
AND APPREHENSIVE LEST HIS REMEMBRANCE OF HER MIGHT BE EFFACED FOR TOO LONG A PERIOD FROM THE HEART SHE REGRETTED SHE DISPATCHED A COURIER TO HIM AS THE BEARER OF THIS IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION
ARE YOU MAD SAID DE GUICHE TO HIS COMPANION AS SOON AS THEY HAD LEFT THE HOTEL DE GRAMMONT
BUT TWO PERSONS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT
THE KING SMILINGLY LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION OF THE COURTIERS AROUND HIM BUT IT COULD EASILY BE PERCEIVED THAT HE GAVE BUT LITTLE IF ANY ATTENTION TO THEIR REMARKS
SHOULD SUCH BE THE CASE WILL YOUR HIGHNESS HAVE THE KINDNESS TO MAKE MY PEACE WITH HIS MAJESTY IF THERE SHOULD BE ANY OCCASION FOR IT I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO SO
MADAME SAID SHE DO YOU KNOW THAT M
SPEAK MONSIEUR SAID THE MUSKETEER
OVER THEIR HEADS WAS EXTENDED THE THICK AND FRAGRANT VAULT OF BRANCHES THROUGH THE OCCASIONAL OPENINGS OF WHICH THE STARS COULD BE SEEN GLITTERING IN THEIR BEAUTY
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THEN THAT I SHOULD TRY TO GUESS THIS NAME SINCE YOU DO NOT TELL IT MY DEAR MARQUISE WHEN I SAW YOU BLUSH I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME IN CONJECTURES IT WAS THE WORD DANAE WHICH YOU USED THAT SURPRISED ME
THE QUEEN-MOTHER WAS EXTREMELY ATTACHED TO HER SON FOR HE WAS HANDSOME IN PERSON AND AMIABLE IN DISPOSITION
AS HOWEVER THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WHO HAD SEEN THE PRINCE RETURN TO THE CHATEAU ENTERED THE ROOM MONSIEUR OVERWHELMED HIM WITH KINDNESS
A ROYAL COURT SAID MADAME DE SAINT-REMY FORCING A LAUGH
VERY WELL MONSIEUR
AH NOW I UNDERSTAND
BESIDES HE ADDED I HAVE NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE GIRL
ARAMIS FIXED A PENETRATING LOOK UPON HIM
WELL SIR SHE INQUIRED WHAT IS YOUR MAJESTY'S OPINION OF THESE THREE PORTRAITS THE KING WHO WISHED TO RELIEVE SAINT-AIGNAN'S EMBARRASSMENT WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIMSELF REPLIED WHY AMARYLLIS IN MY OPINION IS BEAUTIFUL FOR MY PART SAID MONSIEUR I PREFER PHYLLIS
ONLY HE WAS HURRYING TOWARDS ONE OF THE WINGS OF THE CHATEAU BEHIND WHICH HE WAS ON THE POINT OF DISAPPEARING
BUT THE MATTER HAVING NO INTEREST WHATEVER FOR ME I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED DE GUICHE ON THE SUBJECT
CERTAIN VISITORS MAY BE RECEIVED CERTAIN PREFERENCES SHOWN WHICH EXPOSE YOUNG WOMEN TO REMARK AND WHICH ARE ENOUGH TO DRIVE OUT OF THEIR SENSES EVEN THOSE HUSBANDS WHO ARE LEAST DISPOSED TO BE JEALOUS AH
SO THAT VANITY BEING WITH THEM ALMOST ALWAYS THE EQUIVALENT OF LOVE THE LATTER FEELING ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF EQUIPOISE NEVER ATTAINS THAT DEGREE OF PERFECTION WHICH IT ACQUIRES IN MEN AND WOMEN FROM THIRTY TO FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE
THE CARRIAGES WERE FILLED WITH YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WHO AWAITED THE OPPORTUNITY OF SALUTING AS SHE PASSED THE DAUGHTER OF THAT DAUGHTER OF FRANCE WHO DURING HER WIDOWHOOD AND EXILE HAD SOMETIMES GONE WITHOUT WOOD FOR HER FIRE AND BREAD FOR HER TABLE WHOM THE MEANEST ATTENDANT AT THE CHATEAU HAD TREATED WITH INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT
SEATED THUS THE KING MADE A SIGN OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO THOSE WHO WERE RUNNING ABOUT
BUT AS FOR INDICATING IT FROM WHERE WE ARE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE WELL LET US SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN FINDING THAT FORTUNATE PATH IN THAT CASE YOU ARE ALMOST THERE FOR YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO BUT CROSS THE LABYRINTH NOTHING MORE THAN THAT
BUT HER ANGER WAS TOO GREAT NOT TO OVERFLOW FROM MALICORNE ON HIS ACCOMPLICE
MY MIND MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SO
FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES HE REMAINED WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT WHEN THE LANDLORD RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM THE PHYSICIAN WHOM HE HARDLY ALLOWED TIME TO DRESS HIMSELF
THE GUITAR PLAYER VANISHED LIKE A SHADOW
BY THAT STAIRCASE HE WILL ASCEND TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS WHERE SOME NEW PIECES OF MUSIC ARE GOING TO BE PERFORMED DURING DINNER THIS IS ADMIRABLE NEWS YOU TELL ME IS IT NOT MONSIEUR WAS IT M
MY HEAD IS SO TAKEN UP IN ANOTHER DIRECTION THAT I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE A COUPLE LINES VERY WELL SAID ARAMIS WRITE AND HE DICTATED AS FOLLOWS
THAT DAY HAS NOW ARRIVED
BUT HAD MERELY HEARD HIS VOICE
AND THAT IS A BETTER REASON FOR ME TO REMAIN THAN ANY YOU HAVE YET GIVEN BECAUSE I AM TO APPEAR AS AUTUMN AND SHALL HAVE TO DANCE WITH MADAME
WHY DID YOU NOT BRING GRIMAUD WITH YOU GRIMAUD TAKES HIS REST NOW
MY LITTLE NAIAD CONTINUED MADAME WAS COOING OVER HER QUAINT SONG IN THE BED OF THE RIVULET
MADAME GENTLY WITHDREW HER HAND AND FROM THAT MOMENT SHE FELT HER TRIUMPH WAS CERTAIN AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE WAS HER OWN
AND NOW HOW ABOUT THE SOLDIERS EVERYTHING PRECISELY THE SAME IN A RELATIVE DEGREE YOU UNDERSTAND
I WAS QUITE SURE I SHOULD I AM NOT DISPLEASED
FOLLOW ME ATTENTIVELY AS I PROCEED:--MADAME HAS NOTICED AMONG YOUR FRIENDS THE HANDSOMEST AND MOST FASCINATING OF THEM ALL
BUT IN ORDER THAT MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS WHO HAD NOT A LARGE PATRIMONIAL FORTUNE ALTHOUGH AN ONLY DAUGHTER SHOULD BE SUITABLY DOWERED IT WAS NECESSARY THAT SHE SHOULD BELONG TO SOME GREAT PRINCESS AS PRODIGAL AS THE DOWAGER MADAME WAS COVETOUS
COME HERE TOBY SAID FOUQUET TO THE VALET WHO APPROACHED WITH A TOLERABLY FIRM STEP
WAS NOT THE SUPERINTENDENT INDEED KNOWN FOR HIS DELICACY AND DIGNITY OF FEELING
THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT WITH THEIR HEADS BENT DOWN BOWED AS IT WERE BENEATH THE DOUBLE THOUGHT OF THE LOVE WHICH WAS SPRINGING UP IN THEIR HEARTS AND WHICH GIVES BIRTH TO SO MANY HAPPY FANCIES IN THE IMAGINATIONS OF TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
AS SOON AS THE KING'S NAME WAS ANNOUNCED A GENERAL MOVEMENT TOOK PLACE IN THE APARTMENT
WHEN HE SAW THIS PERFECT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE OF CARRIAGES AND RETINUE MALICORNE RUBBED HIS HANDS DELIGHTEDLY THINKING THAT ONE DAY LATER HE SHOULD NOT HAVE FOUND A BED TO LIE UPON AFTER HIS RETURN FROM HIS EXPLORING EXPEDITIONS
THIS MORNING HAVING TAKEN THEM BY SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF A MUSICAL PARTY I GOT JEALOUS
THE VICOMTE THINKS OF MARRYING HE IS STILL VERY YOUNG
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY IT'S A LONG STORY YOU PREFER YOUR OWN LAMENTATIONS THEN
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
CHEVALIER YOU ARE REALLY A VERY GOOD-NATURED FELLOW YOU SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE SURPRISED WELL YOU ARE NOT SO TENDER-HEARTED EVERY DAY THAT MAY BE
I ORDER YOU YOU ORDER ME YES
THERE IS A REPETITION OF THE BALLET THIS AFTERNOON YOU WILL READ HER A LECTURE WHILE YOU ARE DANCING YES MADAME YOU PROMISE TO CONVERT HER I WILL ROOT OUT THE HERESY ALTOGETHER EITHER BY CONVINCING HER OR BY EXTREME MEASURES THAT IS ALL RIGHT THEN
AMUSEMENTS OF A SERIOUS NATURE SHE SAID
HARDLY HOWEVER HAD THEY PROCEEDED A QUARTER OF A MILE ON THE ROAD WHEN THE KING WITH A GRACIOUS SMILE SALUTED THEM AND DREW UP HIS HORSE LEAVING THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGE TO PASS ON THEN THAT OF THE PRINCIPAL LADIES OF HONOR AND THEN ALL THE OTHERS IN SUCCESSION WHO SEEING THE KING STOP WISHED IN THEIR TURN TO STOP TOO
THAT IS WELL MY LORD SHE SAID NOW YOU ARE REASONABLE OR FROM RAOUL YOUR GRACE IS KILLING YOUR HORSE BUCKINGHAM LISTENED PATIENTLY TO RAOUL'S REMARKS FOR HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT WITHOUT HAVING HAD ANY PROOF THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE THAT RAOUL CHECKED THE DISPLAY OF DE GUICHE'S FEELINGS AND THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR RAOUL SOME MAD ACT OR PROCEEDING EITHER OF THE COUNT OR OF BUCKINGHAM HIMSELF WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT AN OPEN RUPTURE OR A DISTURBANCE--PERHAPS EVEN EXILE ITSELF
THEY APPROACHED LIKE ARROWS SHOT FROM THE BOW OF A SKILLFUL ARCHER
SHE WOULD CURE A JEALOUS MAN CERTAINLY
FOUQUET AND CONSEQUENTLY IT TOOK TWO HOURS TO GET TO SAINT-MANDE
AS THE DUKE OF NORFOLK GAVE HIS COMMANDS A LARGE BOAT OR BARGE DECKED WITH FLAGS AND CAPABLE OF HOLDING ABOUT TWENTY ROWERS AND FIFTEEN PASSENGERS WAS SLOWLY LOWERED FROM THE SIDE OF THE ADMIRAL'S VESSEL
YOU ADMIT THEN THAT IT IS NOT YOU WHO ARE GOING TO MARRY THE PRINCESS YOU KNOW IT PERFECTLY WELL MONSIEUR I SHOULD IMAGINE I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT YOUR CONDUCT HAS BEEN SUCH AS TO LEAVE IT NOT ALTOGETHER CERTAIN PROCEED MONSIEUR WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO CONVEY RAOUL APPROACHED THE DUKE
I AGREE TO ACCEPT THAT PEAL OF THUNDER AS A WARNING AND EVEN AS A MENACE IF IN FIVE MINUTES FROM THE PRESENT MOMENT IT IS RENEWED WITH EQUAL VIOLENCE
I ADVISE YOU TO GO TO SLEEP IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY MY DEAR COUNT AND MY ADVICE DE GUICHE SAID RAOUL IS THE VERY OPPOSITE WHAT IS THAT TO MOUNT YOUR HORSE AND SET OFF AT ONCE FOR ONE OF YOUR ESTATES
THEN HE TURNED TOWARDS THE NIGHT BREEZE WHICH BORE TOWARDS HIM HE SEEMED TO THINK THE DISTANT SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE
COUNT DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT NO YOU THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE NEWS YOUR MAJESTY WILL EXCUSE ME
JOVE'S THUNDERS AND LIGHTNINGS ARE HEARD AND SEEN BEFORE THE PALACE IS SET ON FIRE
WHO IS THERE WHO WOULD VENTURE TO THINK I HAD DONE WRONG IN REMAINING ALONE WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FOR PITY'S SAKE SIRE
ADIEU BUCKINGHAM SALUTED DE WARDES AND RETURNED TOWARDS THE KING'S APARTMENTS
TWENTY YEARS AFTER SERIALIZED JANUARY-AUGUST 1845
HE REFLECTED THAT HIS FIRST INFORMATION OUGHT TO COME FROM DE GUICHE
HE HAD THEN NO EXPECTATION OF ANYTHING ELSE HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL HIS RESOURCES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SELLING A HANDSOME SUIT OF CLOTH AND SATIN EMBROIDERED AND LACED WITH GOLD WHICH HAD BEEN THE ADMIRATION OF THE COURT
THE NAME AND CHRISTIAN NAME WERE CAREFULLY REPEATED BY MONSIEUR
IN A WORD IT IS THE MARQUISE CLOSED HER EYES FOR A MOMENT
MADAME DID YOU SAY HE REMARKED
I HAVE COME DE GUICHE HE SAID TO ASK YOUR COMPANIONSHIP
WELL BUT MONSIEUR SAID MADAME DE SAINT-REMY ALL AT ONCE HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO OBTAIN THIS POST I ASKED FOR IT MADAME OF WHOM ONE OF MY FRIENDS AND YOU HAVE FRIENDS SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AT COURT TO GIVE YOU SUCH PROOFS OF THEIR CREDIT IT APPEARS SO AND MAY ONE ASK THE NAME OF THESE FRIENDS I DID NOT SAY I HAD MANY FRIENDS MADAME I SAID I HAD ONE FRIEND AND THAT FRIEND IS CALLED PESTE MADAME YOU GO TOO FAR
NOW HE ADDED WITH A MARKED BENIGNITY OF GESTURE AND TONE DESIRE THE LANDLORD TO COME THEY OBEYED AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE LANDLORD APPEARED AT THE DOOR
HE IS A MAN HIGH IN POWER GOOD SAID THE MARQUISE AS SHE CLENCHED HER HANDS LIKE A PATIENT AT THE APPROACH OF THE KNIFE
WHENCE I KNOW NOT BUT HE WILL PROCURE IT
ALL LINEN AND CLOTHES OF THE FINEST AND BEST QUALITY TO BE PROCURED
AND THIS WITHOUT RECKONING THAT IN CASES OF URGENT NECESSITY AT THE VERY MOMENT PEOPLE MIGHT BE KNOCKING AT THE PRINCIPAL DOOR IN THE RUE DE PARIS ONE COULD MAKE ONE'S ESCAPE BY THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE RUE DE LYON AND CREEPING ALONG THE GARDENS OF THE PRIVATE HOUSES ATTAIN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE FOREST
NONSENSE NAY I ASSURE YOU LET US SPEAK OF OTHER MATTERS SAID ARAMIS
BUT A PALTRY ONE IF HE BEARS YOU ILL-WILL YOU ARE RIGHT MANICAMP
YOU DO NOT KNOW HIM REPLIED RAOUL COLDLY AND YOU ARE EVEN NOT AWARE WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND NOT KNOW WHERE HE IS SUCH MUST BE THE CASE SINCE YOU FIX YOUR QUARREL WITH HIM UPON STRANGERS INSTEAD OF SEEKING M
MONSIEUR LOOKED SPLENDID
ANNE OF AUSTRIA FIXED UPON BUCKINGHAM A LOOK SO TENDER IN ITS EXPRESSION THAT IT DENOTED NOT ALONE THE INDULGENCE OF MATERNAL AFFECTION BUT A GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION LIKE THE COQUETRY OF A WOMAN WHO LOVES
BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION NOW UNFORTUNATELY THE PRESENT AFFAIR IS TO PROCURE FOR ME A SECOND PLACE OF MAID OF HONOR MY FRIEND IF YOU WERE TO PROMISE ME THE PRICE OF HEAVEN I WOULD DECLINE TO DISTURB MYSELF AT THIS MOMENT MALICORNE CHINKED THE MONEY IN HIS POCKET
LE COMTE DE GUICHE YOU SHOULD SAY THAT OF M
THEN TURNING BACK AGAIN BUT AVOIDING PASSING THROUGH THE BREAKFAST APARTMENT HE CROSSED SEVERAL ROOMS WITH THE INTENTION OF SEEKING THE QUEEN-MOTHER IN HER ORATORY WHERE SHE USUALLY REMAINED
HAVE I NOT ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN POOR SELDON YES QUITE TRUE YOU DID SO WELL THAT IS YOUR AFFAIR
YOUR NAIAD ON THE CONTRARY HAS PLEASED ME AND THE MORE SO BECAUSE SHE WAS SO TRUTHFUL AND BECAUSE HER TALE I OUGHT TO ADD IS CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF UNIMPEACHABLE WITNESSES THESE WORDS FELL UPON LA VALLIERE ACCOMPANIED BY A LOOK THAT ON ONE FROM SOCRATES TO MONTAIGNE COULD HAVE EXACTLY DEFINED
HARDLY HAD SHE WATCHED THE KING MOVE AWAY THAN SHE SET OUT IN SEARCH OF SAINT-AIGNAN
TRUE IT IS I AM A BAD DANCER AND MY LEGS ARE NOT WELL MADE
BUT CONFESS DEAR HENRIETTA IF THE MEANS IS AT LEAST INGENIOUS IT IS HARDLY CHARITABLE WHY SO IN CURING THE DREAD OF A WOUND IN A JEALOUS PERSON'S MIND YOU INFLICT ONE UPON THE HEART
WHEN HE RETURNED TO HIS SENSES HE HAD DRUNK ABOUT HALF OF THE POTION OF WHICH THE REMAINDER WAS LEFT IN THE GLASS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF SUPPORTED BY THE PHYSICIAN WHILE THE VENETIAN AND THE CONFESSOR WERE STANDING CLOSE TO THE DOOR
NOW EVERY ONE WILL KNOW TO-MORROW THAT I HAVE BEEN RUNNING ABOUT AFTER LA VALLIERE TO-NIGHT THEN ENDEAVORING TO SEE WHERE HE WAS HE SAID
BUT OUT OF RESPECT NO ONE EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT VERY LIKELY
AND AS HE EATS AND DRINKS AT DESSERT HE CRIES LONG LIVE THE KING AND BLESSES THE BASTILE
WE WERE YOUNG SOLDIERS ALWAYS FIGHTING OR BEING ATTACKED OUR SWORDS ALWAYS IN OUR HANDS OR AT LEAST READY TO BE DRAWN FROM THEIR SHEATHS
LE COMTE DE GUICHE AND YOURS THAT IS TRUE
BUT THIS LOVE WHICH HE COULD NOT HELP FEELING HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO CONCEAL WITH CARE
THEY CAN CONCEAL THEIR OWN FEELINGS FROM A MAN BUT FROM THEM NO MAN CAN CONCEAL HIS
THAT IS WHAT I SAY AS MAID OF HONOR CRIED AT THE SAME TIME MADAME DE SAINT-REMY WITH DESPAIR AND MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WITH DELIGHT
THESE HARMONIOUS VOICES RESUMED SAINT-AIGNAN WERE THOSE OF CERTAIN SHEPHERDESSES WHO HAD BEEN LIKEWISE DESIROUS OF ENJOYING THE COOLNESS OF THE SHADE AND WHO KNOWING THE ISOLATED AND ALMOST UNAPPROACHABLE SITUATION OF THE PLACE HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES THERE TO INTERCHANGE THEIR IDEAS UPON A LOUD BURST OF LAUGHTER OCCASIONED BY THIS REMARK OF SAINT-AIGNAN AND AN IMPERCEPTIBLE SMILE OF THE KING AS HE LOOKED AT TONNAY-CHARENTE FOLLOWED THIS SALLY
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE RESUMED HIS PLACE BESIDE MONSIEUR AND AS HE ACCOMPANIED HIM INSINUATED A FEW DROPS OF THE VENOM HE HAD COLLECTED DURING THE LAST HOUR WHILE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE FACES IN THE COURT AND SUSPECTING THAT SOME OF THEIR HEARTS MIGHT BE HAPPY
DE WARDES IF YOU DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE UPON THE WET SAND OR IF YOU THINK YOURSELF A LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO FRENCH TERRITORY
AND I CONFESS THAT I GREATLY REGRET TO PERCEIVE THAT AN EASY JUSTIFICATION AS YOUR OWN WOULD HAVE BEEN IS NOW COMPLICATED IN MY PRESENCE BY A TISSUE OF REPROACHES AND IMPUTATIONS AGAINST OTHERS AND WHICH YOU DO NOT BELIEVE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE
THE MISTRESS MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS WAS CRUEL AS REGARDED LOVE
A GOOD MANY THINGS MURMURED THE PRINCE IN A DOLEFUL TONE OF VOICE
A WOMAN IS NEVER TRULY LOVED I BELIEVE
RETURN IN TWO YEARS
TAKE A BLANK APPOINTMENT FROM THAT DRAWER AND GIVE IT TO ME GUICHE HANDED THE PRINCE THE DOCUMENT INDICATED AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESENTED HIM WITH A PEN ALREADY DIPPED IN INK
IN THIS WAY DE GUICHE YOU SEE THAT ANY CHILDREN WE MAY HAVE WILL RUN A GOOD CHANCE OF BEING PRETTY IF MY WIFE AND MYSELF HAVE HANDSOME MODELS BEFORE US MOST MAGNIFICENTLY ARGUED MONSEIGNEUR SAID MANICAMP SHOWING HIS APPROVAL BY LOOK AND VOICE AT THE SAME TIME
PERFECTLY HARMLESS I REPEAT AND MORE THAN THAT ALLOWABLE
IF THEREFORE YOU LOVE M
IT WILL NOT BE A VERY WORTHY ALLIANCE MUST I SWEAR INQUIRED THE KING INTOXICATED BY THE VOLUPTUOUS TURN THE WHOLE CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN OVERHEARD US MADAME BIT HER LIPS FOR SHE HAD THOUGHTLESSLY COMMITTED HERSELF
AND THE OTHER WILL ECONOMIZE MONEY FOR YOU AND THIS WILL BE M
DE SAINT-AIGNAN PRODUCED A MOST BRILLIANT EFFECT AND I AM SURE THAT MORE THAN ONE PERSON WHO SAW HIM DANCE THIS EVENING WILL NOT SOON FORGET HIM
BUT WHAT IS IT YOU ARE MUSING ABOUT WHILE I AM SPEAKING TO YOU I YES
DOES NOT A WOMAN'S VIRTUE CONSIST IN THE UNCOMPROMISING REFUSAL OF EVERY INTRIGUE THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE HER
MY CLERKS REPLIED FOUQUET ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE KING WILL PERFORM WONDERS ON HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE AND THE SUM SHALL BE READY IN THREE DAYS IT WAS FOR COLBERT NOW TO TURN PALE
AS SOON HOWEVER AS THE MARQUISE HAD DISAPPEARED HER ENVIOUS ENEMY NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE DESIRE TO SATISFY HERSELF THAT HER SUSPICIONS WERE WELL FOUNDED ADVANCED STEALTHILY LIKE A PANTHER AND SEIZED THE ENVELOPE
AND LASTLY IT IS DANGEROUS TO ALLOW THE MIND TO DWELL ON A THOUSAND WILD FANCIES THE FRUITS OF SOLITUDE AND HEARTACHE
WHY THIS ORDER MONSIEUR INQUIRED RAOUL
MADAME'S DESIRE EXCLAIMED MONTALAIS AND LA VALLIERE TOGETHER
BUT OVERCOME BY THE IRRESISTIBLE BRILLIANCY OF HER EYES HE EVERY MOMENT RETURNED TO CONSECRATE HIS DEFEAT BY NEW SUBMISSIONS TO WHICH MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE DID NOT FAIL TO REPLY BY FRESH ACTS OF IMPERTINENCE
THE LADIES WERE MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE AND MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS
FOREVER
BUT IT WAS THE WORKMANSHIP I SUPPOSE YES MADAME
GIVE ME AN ANSWER SIMPLY
IT IS ONLY THIS EVENING THAT HE HAS REVEALED HIS PASSION THE KING SHOWS HIS GOOD TASTE SAID MADAME
LOUIS XIII HAS DIED AS HAS CARDINAL RICHELIEU AND WHILE THE CROWN OF FRANCE MAY SIT UPON THE HEAD OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA AS REGENT FOR THE YOUNG LOUIS XIV THE REAL POWER RESIDES WITH THE CARDINAL MAZARIN HER SECRET HUSBAND
COLBERT HAS AN INTENSE HATRED FOR M
WHY DOES HE NOT COME HIMSELF HE INQUIRED
THE VALET AGAIN PRESENTED HIMSELF TREMBLING IN A WAY TO INDUCE A BELIEF THAT HE WAS THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS
THAT IS MY IDEA OF LOVE
AND YOUR COMPANION M
FOR OUR CONVERSATION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM THE DUKE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY MUCH AGITATED AND SEEMED TO STRUGGLE WITH HIMSELF A GOOD DEAL
IN OTHER WORDS HE DISCHARGED A PRODIGIOUS NUMBER
AS ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD HERSELF SAID THE PRESENCE OF THE KING GAVE A SOLEMN AND SERIOUS CHARACTER TO THE EVENT
HE SPENT MONEY OUT OF AMBITION
AND I THINK THE KING WAS QUITE RIGHT NOT TO HAVE MADE A DISTURBANCE AGAINST A POOR FELLOW WHOSE WANT OF JUDGMENT IS MORE TO BE COMPLAINED OF THAN HIS INTENTION REALLY SAID THE CHEVALIER AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I CONFESS THAT THIS MAGNANIMITY ASTONISHES ME TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE WHY SO INQUIRED PHILIP
SIRE WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT TRUSTED OR ARE DEEMED INSUFFICIENT THEY SHOULD SCARCELY BE EMPLOYED AND D'ARTAGNAN WITH A MOVEMENT PERFECTLY MILITARY STAMPED WITH HIS FOOT AND LEFT UPON THE FLOOR DUST STAINED WITH BLOOD
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS SHALL BE INFORMED OF IT AND SHE WILL JUDGE AT ALL EVENTS I DO NOT SEE WHY REPLIED MONTALAIS IT SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN M
I HAVE COME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE IT IS THE SAME AS IF YOU SPOKE ON YOUR OWN BEHALF COMTE NOT ALTOGETHER SO SIRE
I AM LIKE A SEE-SAW
THE STATE SECRET
ADIEU RAOUL
AND YOU M
MALICORNE IS A PRINCE IN DISGUISE REPLIED THE OLD LADY HE IS ALL-POWERFUL SEEMINGLY SHOULD YOU ALSO LIKE TO BE A MAID OF HONOR ASKED MALICORNE OF MADAME DE SAINT-REMY
SHE IS A WOMAN FULL OF INTELLIGENCE AND FINE FEELING SHE DID NOT GET ANGRY THEN FAR FROM THAT--SHE DID NOT EVEN SEEM TO UNDERSTAND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAD WRITTEN TO HER SHE MUST HOWEVER HAVE UNDERSTOOD YOU SUFFICIENTLY TO GIVE THE LETTER BACK TO YOU FOR I PRESUME SHE RETURNED IT NOT AT ALL AT LEAST YOU SATISFIED YOURSELF THAT SHE HAD BURNT IT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY I HAVE BEEN PLAYING AT CROSS-PURPOSES FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR AND HOWEVER AMUSING IT MAY BE I BEGIN TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS GAME
WHEN HIS NAME WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE GENTLEMAN-USHER IN ATTENDANCE THE QUEEN WHO WAS SITTING WITH HER ELBOW RESTING ON A TABLE AND HER HEAD BURIED IN HER HANDS ROSE AND SMILINGLY RECEIVED THE GRACEFUL AND RESPECTFUL SALUTATION WHICH THE DUKE ADDRESSED TO HER
AND DID YOU NOT INSIST ON THE CONTRARY I DID INSIST ALMOST IMPERTINENTLY EVEN AND SHE PERSISTED IN HER DENIAL UNHESITATINGLY AND DID SHE NOT CONTRADICT HERSELF NOT ONCE BUT IN THAT CASE THEN YOU HAVE LEFT OUR LETTER IN HER HANDS HOW COULD I DO OTHERWISE OH
AT BELLE-ISLE D'ARTAGNAN DISCOVERS THAT THE ENGINEER OF THE FORTIFICATIONS IS IN FACT PORTHOS NOW THE BARON DU VALLON AND THAT'S NOT ALL
IN FACT THEY BOTH REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT AND THE KING'S VOICE REACHED THEM WHERE THEY WERE
I HAVE GIVEN YOU A COMMISSION OF LADY OF HONOR WHICH YOU WISHED FOR
FETES AND BRILLIANT DISPLAYS RECEIVED THEM EVERYWHERE ALONG THE LINE OF MARCH
DE WARDES THEN SAW THAT NOTHING COULD WELL BE MORE SERIOUSLY INTENDED THAN THE THREAT IN QUESTION FOR THE BASTILE EVEN AT THAT PERIOD WAS ALREADY HELD IN DREAD
MALICORNE LEARNED TWO THINGS
LOUIS SOUGHT HIS MOTHER'S GLANCE AS THOUGH TO SHOW HER THAT HE WAS MASTER
I SELECTED THEM EXPRESSLY
WHAT WAS YOUR REPLY MONSIEUR INQUIRED THE COUNT STAMPING HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND
THE KING DESCENDED THE STAIRS AND AT THE MOMENT HE APPEARED UPON THE FLIGHT OF STEPS EVERY ONE STOPPED
MADAME IN HER CHARACTER AS HOSTESS ROSE TO RECEIVE THE ROYAL VISITOR
THE TRAVELER WITH THE CLOAK HELD OVER HIS FACE WAS ARAMIS WHO AFTER HE HAD LEFT FOUQUET AND TAKEN FROM A PORTMANTEAU WHICH HIS SERVANT HAD OPENED A CAVALIER'S COMPLETE COSTUME QUITTED THE CHATEAU AND WENT TO THE HOTEL OF THE BEAU PAON WHERE BY LETTERS SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD AS THE LANDLORD HAD STATED DIRECTED A ROOM AND AN APARTMENT TO BE RETAINED FOR HIM
WHEN THE MANEUVER HAD BEEN COMPLETED THE VESSEL WHICH BORE THE ADMIRAL SALUTED FRANCE BY TWELVE DISCHARGES OF CANNON WHICH WERE RETURNED DISCHARGE FOR DISCHARGE FROM FORT FRANCIS I
SIRE I CANNOT BE HAPPY HERE ANY LONGER SHE SAID
I SHALL BE LOW-SPIRITED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MADAME WILL BE ALONE
BUT HE THOUGHT HE PERCEIVED THAT THE TIME FOR INDULGENCE AND EVEN FOR THE UTMOST INDIFFERENCE HAD ARRIVED AND THAT IN ORDER TO THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE QUESTION IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO PUT THE LAMP AS THE SAYING IS BENEATH THE HUSBAND'S VERY NOSE
FOUR MILLIONS HE SAID
AS FAR AS MADAME WAS CONCERNED HER REGARD FOR THE KING MAY EASILY BE EXPLAINED
THE NAME OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM RECALLED CERTAIN RECOLLECTIONS OF A VERY TENDER AND MELANCHOLY NATURE
THAT IS ALL I HAD TO SAY TO YOU
WHY WAS THERE SUCH A DISPLAY OF FORCES IF IT WERE NOT SERIOUSLY HER INTENTION TO DISLODGE THE KING FROM A HEART THAT HAD NEVER BEEN OCCUPIED BEFORE IN WHICH HE SEEMED DISPOSED TO TAKE REFUGE
MANICAMP HE EXCLAIMED
THE HOST REPLIED BY MAKING A SIMILAR SIGN ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD LED GUICHE AND SAINT-AIGNAN A GOOD DISTANCE FROM THE CHATEAU
THE GENERAL HE CRIED
YOU WISH THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM TO LEAVE DO YOU NOT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MADAME SEND THE DUKE TO ME THEN
COME HENRIETTA INSTEAD OF TRYING TO CONTEND AGAINST MONSIEUR'S JEALOUSY BY A DEPARTURE WHICH WOULD KILL ME HENRIETTA SLIGHTLY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS LIKE A WOMAN UNCONVINCED
BUT WHY DID YOU WRITE ME A LETTER STIMULATING MY GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU
LET US GO TO THE PRINCE MY DEAR M
WHILST THE BOURGEOIS OF THE CITY WERE THINKING OUT HIS EPITAPH WHICH WAS FAR FROM BEING A PANEGYRIC
ALL THAT MASSIVE PLATE WHICH I DID NOT WISH TO PART WITH ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH IT AH
THIS TRIPLE TESTIMONY OVERWHELMED THE KING
AND SO HE WISHES TO SET OFF AGAIN HE HAS THIS VERY DAY RECEIVED LETTERS WHICH WILL PERHAPS COMPEL HIM TO LEAVE SO THAT BEFORE SETTING OFF FOR THAT UNKNOWN REGION CALLED BRETAGNE HE IS DESIROUS OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO YOUR MAJESTY IS HE WAITING HE IS HERE SIRE LET HIM ENTER FOUQUET MADE A SIGN TO THE USHER IN ATTENDANCE WHO WAS WAITING BEHIND THE TAPESTRY
YOU ARE RIGHT EXCLAIMED THE KING SUDDENLY
WHAT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO ENTER THE BASTILE SAID ARAMIS
DO SO THEY ARE ON THE OPPOSITE STAIRCASE THEY ALTERED THEIR COURSE BUT ON REACHING THE LANDING OF THE GRAND STAIRCASE RAOUL PERCEIVED A SERVANT IN THE COMTE DE GUICHE'S LIVERY WHO RAN TOWARDS HIM AS SOON AS HE HEARD HIS VOICE
WAIT THEN AND CHOOSE YOUR OPPORTUNITY BUT FINISH EVERYTHING SPEEDILY
MANICAMP WISHES FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A SECOND MAID OF HONOR YOU PERCEIVE WHAT HE HAS WRITTEN MONSIEUR LE COMTE FOR WHOM WAS THE FIRST APPOINTMENT MALICORNE FELT THE COLOR RISE IN HIS FACE AS HE ANSWERED HURRIEDLY
SUDDENLY HOWEVER SHE STOPPED
SPRING CAST ITS FLOWERS AND ITS PERFUMED FOLIAGE ON THEIR PATH
AT ONE END A GROUP OF WOMEN AROUND ONE OF THE COURTIERS TALKING TOGETHER AMID SMOTHERED BURSTS OF LAUGHTER
I WILL FOLLOW YOU HE STAMMERED OUT FOLLOWING ATHOS DOWN THE STAIRCASE
CAN YOU TELL SAID MADAME IN DESPAIR
WHEN THEY MET THEY CONGRATULATED EACH OTHER UPON THEIR GOOD FORTUNE AND MANICAMP AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO ASK HIS FRIEND IF HE HAD NOT A FEW CROWNS STILL REMAINING AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS POCKET
YOU KNOW SHE SAID WITH AN EFFORT THAT MY HEART WILL NEVER BE COLD TOWARDS A FRIEND LIKE YOURSELF MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE THANK YOU LOUISE
MALICORNE SAID LOUISE WITH HER SWEET SOFT VOICE
THE FETES HAD BEEN MAGNIFICENT
IT WILL BE FOUND SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED AT LEAST WE HOPE SO IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER
RAOUL LOVING AS HE DOES WILL GET OUT OF TEMPER AND ONCE IN AN ANGRY MOOD IF HE WERE TO MEET DE WARDES THE SHELL WOULD EXPLODE WE WILL PREVENT THE EXPLOSION NOT I SAID ATHOS FOR I MUST RETURN TO BLOIS
THE KING WAS TOLD OF IT I SUPPOSE THE KING HEARD IT AHIME AS THE CARDINAL USED TO SAY THE KING WAS HIDDEN IN THE THICKET CLOSE TO THE ROYAL OAK IT FOLLOWS THEN SAID MALICORNE THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE PLAN WHICH THE KING AND MADAME HAVE ARRANGED WILL GO AS EASILY AS IF IT WERE ON WHEELS AND WILL PASS OVER POOR BRAGELONNE'S BODY PRECISELY SO WELL SAID MALICORNE AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION DO NOT LET US INTERPOSE OUR POOR SELVES BETWEEN A LARGE OAK-TREE AND A GREAT KING FOR WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE GROUND TO PIECES THE VERY THING I WAS GOING TO SAY TO YOU LET US THINK OF OURSELVES THEN MY OWN IDEA OPEN YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES THEN AND YOU YOUR LARGE EARS APPROACH YOUR LITTLE MOUTH FOR A KISS HERE SAID MONTALAIS WHO PAID THE DEBT IMMEDIATELY IN RINGING COIN
BRAGELONNE COMES OF A VALIANT RACE SIRE THEN HE IS THE SON OF THAT NOBLEMAN WHO CAME TO ME OR RATHER TO M
BUT SO IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WHY IMPOSSIBLE TELL US SOMETHING CREDIBLE AND WE WILL BELIEVE YOU YET IF YOU WERE TO SUPPOSE ONE THING WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSE THAT I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE AND THAT I AM NOT WHAT
HE WAS STILL MORE FURIOUS BECAUSE HE HAD PERMITTED HIMSELF TO LAUGH THAN FROM HAVING SEEN OTHERS LAUGH
THAT VOICE MUST BE SILENCED YOU WISH MONSIEUR'S DEATH EXCLAIMED RAOUL
IT IS PLAIN ALSO THAT IT HAD BEEN BRAVELY EXECUTED
SEND THE DUKE TO ME THAT WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE AT MY WIFE'S DOOR WHOSE LEVEE HE IS PROBABLY AWAITING VERY WELL SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA CALMLY
UPON WHAT UPON WHAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE OH MONSEIGNEUR IT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER IT IS ABOMINABLE
THE KING ENTERED MADAME'S PRIVATE APARTMENTS ACKNOWLEDGING AND RETURNING THE SALUTATIONS AS HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
ANNE OF AUSTRIA REMEMBERED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE EXILED RATHER BY HER WISH THAN THE KING'S AND THEN DYING IN EXILE THE WIFE OF A GENTLEMAN OF OBSCURE BIRTH AND POSITION
BUT ALL I NOW HAVE TO DO IS PASS FROM WHERE I NOW AM TO YOUR APARTMENT WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THE DOOR OF THE CHATEAU WILL BE OPENED FOR ME AT THIS HOUR
THE KING'S SISTER-IN-LAW FELT A STORM MUSTERING ABOVE HER HEAD
SHE WAS STATIONED AS CERTAIN BODIES OF TROOPS ARE WHOSE WEAKNESS IS SUSPECTED AND WHO ARE PLACED BETWEEN TWO EXPERIENCED REGIMENTS
THEY ARE SAVAGES WHOM IT IS NECESSARY TO POLISH AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE INSTRUCTS THEM AND M
IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO ARE THE TWO NYMPHS THE TWO DRYADS THE TWO HAMADRYADS WHO HAVE SO GOOD AN OPINION OF US I SHALL KNOW THEM AGAIN VERY WELL I ASSURE YOU WITHOUT RUNNING AFTER THEM BY WHAT MEANS BY THEIR VOICES OF COURSE
THE RESULT WILL BE THAT YOUR CONCILIATORY ADDRESS WILL END IN A VIOLATION OF THE KING'S PROHIBITION NOT SO SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN WHAT WILL BE THE RESULT THEN THE RESULT WILL BE THAT I SHALL GO TO THE KING WITH WHOM I AM ON TOLERABLY GOOD TERMS TO WHOM I HAVE BEEN HAPPY ENOUGH TO RENDER CERTAIN SERVICES DATING FROM A PERIOD WHEN YOU WERE NOT BORN AND WHO AT MY REQUEST HAS JUST SENT ME AN ORDER IN BLANK FOR M
MOST CERTAINLY NOT
FAREWELL DE GUICHE THE RECEPTION WAS TO TAKE PLACE IN THE KING'S APARTMENTS
BUT IT WILL BE USELESS FOR YOU TO SAY ANYTHING FOR I PERSIST IN MY OPINION OF YOU
BUT IT IS HIS PARENTS FAULT IN WHAT WAY NO DOUBT
THE KING EXCLAIMED MALICORNE
IF IT BE MONEY NOTHING COULD BE MORE FORTUNATE FOR I AM IN FUNDS
THE COMMONEST THING IN THE COMPLICATED HISTORY OF LOVE IS THE DOUBLE INOCULATION OF LOVE TO WHICH ANY TWO HEARTS ARE SUBJECTED
RAOUL WOULD KILL THE KING AS HE WOULD A COMMON THIEF GOOD HEAVENS SAID MONTALAIS
ALL YOU CAN DO IS TO PAY M
NOTHING EASIER SAID A THIRD VOICE
RAOUL WAS CALM GRAVE AND UPRIGHT
YOU ARE GOING AWAY RAOUL SHE CRIED
IT DOES NOT MATTER IF MANICAMP TEARS HIS CLOTHES FOR HE CAN MAKE USE OF M
MONSIEUR THEN APPROACHED THEM SAYING IN A HOARSE TONE OF VOICE I AM DELIGHTED
D'HERBLAY TO THAT BISHOPRIC I SEE I SEE
A LITTLE WHILE AGO YOU SAID IT WAS FROM A FEAR OF INTRUDING
VIEUVILLE SAID TO YOUR ANCESTOR HENRY IV DOMINE NON SUM DIGNUS 11 TO WHICH I REPLY MONSIEUR FOUQUET THAT IF YOU GIVE A FETE I WILL GO WHETHER I AM INVITED OR NOT I THANK YOUR MAJESTY DEEPLY SAID FOUQUET AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD BENEATH THIS FAVOR WHICH HE WAS CONVINCED WOULD BE HIS RUIN
I THANK YOU IN THE NAME OF MY FACE MADAME SAID MALICORNE
DE WARDES'S SAFETY TO BE LOOKED TO FIRST OR I WILL HAVE YOU ALL HANGED THE BOAT HAD BY THIS TIME REACHED THEM
FOUQUET NO DOUBT LOVES ME BUT HE IS TOO PROUD
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS KNOWS VERY WELL WHAT IT IS REPLIED THE LATTER IN A HYPOCRITICAL TONE
THEY BURST INTO A PEAL OF LAUGHER
AND IN A WORD THAT TO THE FATHERS WHO HAD HATED WITH THEIR HEARTS AND FOUGHT WITH THEIR ARMS WOULD NOW SUCCEED THE SONS WHO WOULD INDEED HATE WITH THEIR HEARTS BUT WOULD NO LONGER COMBAT THEIR ENEMIES SAVE BY MEANS OF INTRIGUE OR TREACHERY
PERHAPS HE IS IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS INQUIRED FOUQUET
AND NOW THE SECOND ETEXT OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE
IF HE HAS A FANCY OR A STRONG DESIRE AND AN ABSORBING PASSION FOR A COQUETTE HE CANNOT MISTAKE HER
THE DUKE HOWEVER WORE ABOUT HIM A SACHET A LA VIOLETTE AND I AM SURE THAT THE ONE MY WIFE HAS CAME FROM HIM INDEED MONSIEUR SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA YOU BUILD YOUR PYRAMIDS ON NEEDLE POINTS
A CROWD OF PEOPLE SWARMING UPON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER WITHOUT RECKONING THE GROUPS OF PEASANTS DRAWN TOGETHER BY THEIR ANXIETY TO SEE THE KING AND THE PRINCESS WAS FOR MANY MINUTES THE MOST DISORDERLY BUT THE MOST AGREEABLE MOB IMAGINABLE
DO NOT SPEAK TO ANY ONE OF THE INJURY I HAVE DONE YOU FORGIVE OTHERS THAT WHICH THEY MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED
YOU WILL FORGIVE ME I TRUST M
I CAN FIND YOU A HUNDRED NAY A THOUSAND
WHEN SUDDENLY CONTINUED THE KING MONSIEUR WHO WAS LISTENING HEARD THE WORD BANOS WHICH THE QUEEN PRONOUNCED WITH SOME DEGREE OF BITTERNESS THAT AWAKENED HIS ATTENTION
I THOUGHT SIRE MY PRESENCE AT THE LOUVRE WAS SUFFICIENTLY URGENT TO EXCUSE MY PRESENTING MYSELF THUS BEFORE YOU YOU BRING ME GREAT NEWS THEN MONSIEUR SIRE THE THING IS THIS IN TWO WORDS
YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS MONTALAIS SAID LOUISE
ARE YOU THE ARCHITECT OF THE PRISONS MONSIEUR SAID THE JAILER
THE DRYADS INHABIT THE FOREST AS YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS AWARE I AM AWARE ALSO THAT THEY ARE NATURALLY VERY TALKATIVE MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN SUCH IS THE CASE MADAME
YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE PERFECTLY WELL INFORMED I ADMIT
TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S HORSE TO THE STABLES CRIED BAISEMEAUX
MY NATURE IS NOT SUCH THAT ITS VIVACITIES NEED CHECKING
BUT DE GUICHE AND RAOUL WERE NOT THE ONLY WATCHERS
WHAT'S THE MATTER INQUIRED THE PRINCE
I HAVE EVEN ASCENDED AGAIN THE STEPS OF A THRONE AND I THOUGHT THAT IN ALLYING MYSELF WITH A FRENCH PRINCE I SHOULD FIND IN HIM A RELATION A FRIEND AN EQUAL
NOW SHE SAID SINCE ONE CAN HEAR FROM THIS PLACE LET US LISTEN TO WHAT M
BUT I HAVE JUST MET ONE OF OUR THREE LOQUACIOUS WOOD-NYMPHS AND I CONFESS THAT MY ATTENTION HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM OTHER MATTERS AH SAID THE KING EAGERLY YOU HAVE FOUND THEN THE ONE WHO DEIGNED TO SPEAK OF ME IN SUCH ADVANTAGEOUS TERMS
QUITE ALONE THEREFORE HE ENTERED THE ROOMS A DOOR ON THE LEFT OPENING TO MADAME'S APARTMENT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT TO THE YOUNG QUEEN'S
I WILL ECONOMIZE SIRE
I DO NOT WISH HIM TO MARRY HER UNTIL SHE HAS ACQUIRED A FORTUNE
IS THAT YOUR HANDWRITING YES BUT AND YOUR SUMMONS THE CARDINAL HESITATED TO ANSWER
YES IT WAS SO THEN EXCLAIMED RAOUL DELIGHTEDLY
BUT I CAME AS SOON AS I WAS FREE IS PARIS QUIET PERFECTLY SO
RAOUL COLORED AND SMILED
IN CHASING THAT THEY WORKED IN SOLID METAL
IF YOU DO NOT OBJECT WE WILL HURRY OURSELVES FOR THE SEA I PERCEIVE IS RISING FAST AND NIGHT IS SETTING IN MY REASON FOR NOT WALKING FASTER WAS THAT I DID NOT WISH TO PRECEDE YOUR GRACE
I ACCOSTED HER QUESTIONED HER AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD
AND BELIEVE ME THEY WILL ONLY BE THE BETTER APPRECIATED YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS YOU WANT MONEY M
HE COULD HARDLY YET DESPAIR BUT HE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO IMPOSE SILENCE UPON THE TUMULTUOUS OUTCRIES OF HIS HEART
FORTUNATELY NO SIRE
WHAT DO YOU WANT MALICORNE TOOK UP THE PEN INK AND PAPER AGAIN AND PRESENTED THEM ALL TO MANICAMP
WHEN THEY DO NOT RESEMBLE M
MONSEIGNEUR IS MISTAKEN HE SAID BEFORE EVEN FOUQUET COULD INTERROGATE HIM YOU MUST HAVE GIVEN TOBY SOME COMMISSION FOR HE HAS BEEN TO THE STABLES AND TAKEN YOUR LORDSHIP'S SWIFTEST HORSE AND SADDLED IT HIMSELF WELL AND HE HAS GONE OFF GONE EXCLAIMED FOUQUET
RAOUL OBSERVED ITS EFFECT UPON BUCKINGHAM WHO TREMBLED WITH ANGER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND LEANED AGAINST ONE OF THE POLES OF THE TENT TO PREVENT HIMSELF FALLING
NOT ALL THE EDITIONS SPLIT THEM IN THE SAME MANNER HENCE SOME OF THE CONFUSION...BUT WAIT...THERE'S YET MORE REASON FOR CONFUSION WE INTEND TO DO ALL OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPLIT INTO FOUR ETEXTS ENTITLED THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE TEN YEARS LATER LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE AND THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
DE GUICHE AND BRAGELONNE LIGHTLY MOUNTED THE LADDER ON THE STARBOARD SIDE AND CONDUCTED BY THE DUKE OF NORFOLK WHO RESUMED HIS PLACE NEAR THEM THEY APPROACHED TO OFFER THEIR HOMAGE TO THE PRINCESS
MADAME SOFTLY DREW DE GUICHE ABOUT A HUNDRED PACES AWAY FROM THAT INDISCREET TREE WHICH HAD HEARD AND HAD ALLOWED SO MANY THINGS TO BE HEARD DURING THE EVENING AND LEADING HIM TO A NEIGHBORING GLADE SO THAT THEY COULD SEE A CERTAIN DISTANCE AROUND THEM SHE SAID IN A TREMBLING VOICE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE BECAUSE YONDER WHERE YOU WERE EVERYTHING CAN BE OVERHEARD EVERYTHING CAN BE OVERHEARD DID YOU SAY MADAME REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN MECHANICALLY
MY SERVANTS ARE AFRAID WE SHALL BE DROWNED AND HAVE CONVERTED THE BOAT INTO A CRUISER
COLBERT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SIRE YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE COLBERT BOWED
MADAME MADAME HE MURMURED WHAT OPINION CAN YOU HAVE OF ME WHEN YOU MAKE ME SUCH AN OFFER OF YOU RETURNED THE MARQUISE
THEN SEEMING TO MAKE UP HIS MIND HE SAID HAVE YOU REMARKED A VERY SINGULAR COINCIDENCE MONSEIGNEUR NO
AND LASTLY HIS EYES FELL UPON MADAME
BESIDES THE LEAST I CAN DO IS TO RECEIVE YOU IN THE BEST WAY I CAN BUT WHY SO BECAUSE NOT EVEN A PRINCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME NONSENSE
TO REPROACH THEM FOR AN ERROR THEY HAVE NOT COMMITTED IS SOMETIMES ALMOST EQUIVALENT TO TELLING THEM THEY MIGHT BE GUILTY OF EVEN WORSE VERY GOOD VERY GOOD
DE BRAGELONNE'S HAPPINESS AND FROM THE PRESENT MOMENT THEREFORE I OPPOSE HIS MARRIAGE BUT SIRE EXCLAIMED ATHOS YOUR MAJESTY HAS PROMISED NOT SO COMTE I DID NOT PROMISE YOU FOR IT IS OPPOSED TO MY OWN VIEWS I APPRECIATE YOUR MAJESTY'S CONSIDERATE AND GENEROUS INTENTIONS ON MY BEHALF
HE IS SMITTEN WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE HE WEAVES DREAMS OF BLISS FOR THE FUTURE
NO ONE SLANDERS YOU ELISE WHAT!--PEOPLE SAY THAT I AM IN LOVE AND YET THEY DO NOT SLANDER ME IN THE FIRST PLACE IF IT BE TRUE IT IS NO SLANDER BUT SIMPLY A SCANDAL-LOVING REPORT
MANICAMP HIMSELF WAS ANNOUNCED TO YOU INSTEAD OF WHICH IT IS ONLY AN ENVOY FROM HIM AH EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE COLDLY
THESE KISSES HOWEVER WHICH SHE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH AT FIRST TO RESIST BEGAN TO INTIMIDATE THE YOUNG GIRL
YOU KNOW LOUISE HOW DEVOTEDLY I LOVE YOU WITH WHAT PERFECT AND UNRESERVED CONFIDENCE I RESERVE MY LIFE FOR YOU
GO TELL ME AND I WILL ANSWER YOU FRANKLY YES IF THE THING BE TRUE YOU KNOW THAT I AM ANXIOUS TO HAVE THAT COMMISSION OF LADY OF HONOR WHICH I HAVE BEEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO ASK OF YOU AND YOU DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT WHO I MALICORNE CAST DOWN HIS EYES JOINED HIS HANDS AND ASSUMED HIS SULLEN AIR
DE WARDES WAS NOT DEAD
WHEN THIS GENTLEMAN LEAVES YOU WILL RETURN HERE THE JESUIT LEFT THE ROOM AND DOUBTLESS AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS MOMENTARY EXILE FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE DYING MAN TO ASK THE HOST FOR SOME EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS STRANGE PENITENT WHO TREATED HIS CONFESSOR NO BETTER THAN HE WOULD A MAN SERVANT
THE BARGE BEARING THE PRINCESS QUITTED THE ADMIRAL'S VESSEL AT THE VERY MOMENT BUCKINGHAM LANDED
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN THE FAVOR WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA THUS EXTENDED TO THE YOUNG MAN AND THE WELCOME SOUND OF THE LANGUAGE OF A COUNTRY FROM WHICH THE DUKE HAD BEEN ESTRANGED SINCE HIS STAY IN FRANCE DEEPLY AFFECTED HIM
THIS LOOK HAD ESCAPED BUCKINGHAM WHO HAD EYES FOR NOTHING BUT NORFOLK OF WHOM HE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY JEALOUS
I HAVE HOPES HOWEVER MURMURED THE DOCTOR
THE ALLITERATION WILL HELP ME SAY WHAT YOU LIKE MONSEIGNEUR I CAN PROMISE YOU YOUR INSPECTOR OF APARTMENTS WILL NOT BE ANNOYED
GENTLEMEN I SHOULD WISH TO ISSUE MY INVITATIONS
ARE YOU IN WANT OF MONEY AH EXCLAIMED MANICAMP MOURNFULLY
HE IS NOT AT FONTAINEBLEAU AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED AND D'ARTAGNAN IS NEVER ABSENT OR APPARENTLY IDLE WITHOUT SOME OBJECT IN VIEW
AND THE TRUTH IS THAT NEARLY EVERYTHING HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH MANICAMP'S PRESENTATIONS TO DE GUICHE AND THROUGH DE GUICHE TO MONSIEUR I ASSURE YOU MONSEIGNEUR I WAS IGNORANT OF THAT SAID RAOUL AND WHAT YOUR HIGHNESS DOES ME THE HONOR TO IMPART IS PERFECTLY NEW TO ME I WILL MOST READILY BELIEVE YOU ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE
YOUR BROTHER ON THE CONTRARY HAS BEEN MARRIED BUT A FORTNIGHT WELL HE IS NOW FINDING FAULT WITH MADAME A SECOND TIME WHAT BUCKINGHAM STILL NO ANOTHER WHO GUICHE REALLY
AND SHE INQUIRED RAOUL
DO YOU BLAME ME OH NO RETURNED MARIA THERESA CLAPPING HER HANDS WITH A CHILDLIKE EXPRESSION OF DELIGHT
IT WAS PERHAPS EVEN A LITTLE TOO MUCH
FOUQUET AT THE MARQUISE'S FEET
AND BENEATH HER HOOD A BRIGHT JOYOUS SMILE ILLUMINED HER FEATURES
MONSIEUR SAID HE TO DE GUICHE WAS IN AN EXCELLENT HUMOR AND NO NONE COULD SAY THAT THE SLIGHTEST CLOUD HAD PASSED ACROSS THE CONJUGAL SKY
AND WHILE THE INNKEEPER STOOD RESPECTFULLY NEAR IT THE FRANCISCAN COLLECTED HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT
HER ULTIMATUM REPLIED MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE DIPLOMATICALLY
SUDDENLY THE FRANCISCAN RECOVERED HIMSELF
SUDDENLY A VOICE WAS HEARD BEHIND THEM FULL OF GRACE AND COURTESY SAYING I BELIEVE I HEARD MY NAME PRONOUNCED THEY TURNED ROUND AND SAW D'ARTAGNAN WHO WITH A SMILING EYE AND A CHEERFUL FACE HAD JUST PLACED HIS HAND ON DE WARDES'S SHOULDER
I UNDERSTAND MEN PRETTY WELL
ON THE CONTRARY COUNT I SAY TO YOU REMAIN ARE YOU SURE INQUIRED DE GUICHE THAT THE REPETITION OF THE BALLET STILL TAKES PLACE QUITE SURE WELL YOU SEE RAOUL CONTINUED DE GUICHE ENDEAVORING TO SMILE YOU SEE THE COURT IS NOT SO VERY SORROWFUL OR SO READILY DISPOSED FOR INTERNAL DISSENSIONS WHEN DANCING IS CARRIED ON WITH SUCH ASSIDUITY
LA VALLIERE HE EXCLAIMED
YOU IN SEARCH OF AND SELECTING THE FUTURE GENERAL THAT IS YOUR OWN SUCCESSOR DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF ABOUT THAT MONSIEUR BUT FULFIL IMMEDIATELY THE PRINCIPAL CONDITION OF FURNISHING THE ORDER WITH A SECRET OF IMPORTANCE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST COURTS OF EUROPE WILL BY YOUR INSTRUMENTALITY FOREVER BE SUBJECTED TO THE ORDER
THE LABYRINTH
ARE THEY NOT A MELANCHOLY CREW OF GRUMBLERS ALWAYS EQUALLY UNHAPPY WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT A CAUSE
I HAVE BEEN HERE AT FONTAINEBLEAU SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS EVENING INQUIRING FOR DE GUICHE IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT NO DE GUICHE CAN BE FOUND
ALREADY FOR MORE THAN A YEAR PAST HE HAD BEEN KING AND DURING THAT YEAR HE HAD LEARNED HOW TO DISSEMBLE
OH OH SAID FOUQUET I WAS QUITE RIGHT IN WHAT I SAID COME SAID ARAMIS LET US REJOIN THE CARRIAGES WE SHALL NOT HAVE TIME SAID FOUQUET FOR HERE COMES THE RAIN IN FACT AS HE SPOKE AND AS IF THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED A SHOWER OF LARGE DROPS OF RAIN WAS SUDDENLY HEARD PATTERING ON THE LEAVES ABOUT THEM
AND YET THE ELDEST OF US IS NOT TWENTY YET
I SEEM TO KNOW THAT NAME
BUT MY NAME IS MALICORNE SIMPLY YOU APPEAR TO ME MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED THE COUNT LOOKING AT THE ASTUTE FACE OF HIS COMPANION TO BE A MOST AGREEABLE MAN
AS FOR LOUISE WHETHER FROM NATURAL TIMIDITY OR SOME OTHER REASON FOR WHICH RAOUL COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHE KEPT HER EYES CONSTANTLY CAST DOWN
FROM LE HAVRE TO PARIS
THERE IS ONE I CAN ASSURE YOU SAID MADAME
HE WAS FROM TWENTY-FOUR TO TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE OF PALE COMPLEXION BRIGHT EYES AND BROWN HAIR AND EYEBROWS
DISTANT MUSIC REACHED THEM IN RESPONSE AND WHEN THE SOFT NOTES DIED AWAY THE NIGHTINGALE WITH THROAT OF PRIDE POURED FORTH HIS MELODIOUS CHANTS AND HIS MOST COMPLICATED LEARNED AND SWEETEST COMPOSITIONS TO THOSE WHO HAD MET BENEATH THE THICK COVERT OF THE WOODS
FONTAINEBLEAU
I SHALL BE STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING
YOU SEE NO DIFFICULTY THEREFORE HE ADDED IN RESTORING ME THAT UNHAPPY LETTER WHAT LETTER INQUIRED LA VALLIERE
WHATEVER YOU WOULD WISH ME TO DO I WILL DO
THAT MY BROTHER HAS SUDDENLY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH WHOM WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE AS IT WAS DARK MADAME COULD SMILE AT HER EASE
AND FOLLOWING A BY-PATH THEY RAN ACROSS THE GRASS
THE ENGLISH TRANSFERRED THE WOUNDED MAN TO THEM AT THE VERY MOMENT THE LATTER BEGAN TO OPEN HIS EYES AGAIN
LET ME NEVER HEAR ANY ILL WORDS AGAINST THE FARE OF THE BASTILE SAID HE HALF CLOSING HIS EYES
MOREOVER THE DESIRE WHICH THEY HAD TO SHOW THEIR RESPECT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DELAY TO MADAME AND HER ILLUSTRIOUS MOTHER INDUCED THEM TO BRAVE THE SEA WHICH IS VERY TEMPESTUOUS TO-DAY EVEN FOR SAILORS
THIS WAS A FRESH MISFORTUNE FOR BUCKINGHAM WHO FANCIED HE PERCEIVED IN MADAME HENRIETTA'S LOOK A DEEPER FEELING THAN THAT OF CURIOSITY
YOU ARE AN HONORABLE MAN WITH WHOM MY FAMILY HAS DEALT FOR THIRTY YEARS
AND DID HE NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME NOT A WORD THAT IS VERY UNKIND
AND MONSEIGNEUR GETS ME IMPRISONED BECAUSE HE CARES FOR ME TOO MUCH
RAOUL EXCLAIMED MONTALAIS
BUT I WAS DECEIVED FOUQUET BOWED
ON LEAVING YOU I AM GOING TO MADAME
AD MAJOREM DEI GLORIAM WAS THE MOTTO OF THE JESUITS
BUT IF THEY GET BORED TO DEATH THROUGH THE KING'S MEANS AND AMUSE THEMSELVES THROUGH M
MAZARIN'S GUARDS
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT
NO JESTS OF THAT KIND
EVERY ONE MUST HAVE RETURNED TO THE KING'S APARTMENTS WHERE THE NIGHT IS TO BE FINISHED
SIRE YOUR MAJESTY WHO IS AWARE OF EVERYTHING WHICH OCCURS IN YOUR KINGDOM OUGHT TO KNOW BEFOREHAND THE VERSES CONFIDED TO M
LOOK LOOK THE LITTLE DOOR OPENS
BELLE-ISLE BELONGS TO M
TO ADD TO THE CONFUSION IN THE CASE OF OUR ETEXTS IT REFERS TO THE FIRST 104 CHAPTERS OF THE WHOLE BOOK COVERING MATERIAL IN THE FIRST AND SECOND ETEXTS IN THE NEW SERIES
THE LOTTERY I HAVE PROPOSED IS MY MEANS OF ATTRACTION FOR THAT PURPOSE
COLBERT THIS WORD CLERK DID NOT POSSESS IN 1661 THE SOMEWHAT SUBSERVIENT SIGNIFICATION ATTACHED TO IT IN THE PRESENT DAY
THAT HE HAD BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY ATTENTIVE TO MADEMOISELLE DE CHATILLON
I SUMMONED HIM AND WILL RECEIVE HIM
IT MATTERS LITTLE HOWEVER THE INSULT HAS BEEN GIVEN AND I CONSIDER MYSELF INSULTED ACCORDINGLY
I CANNOT SPEAK TO HIM AT PRESENT SAID RAOUL
WHILE WITH REGARD TO LA VALLIERE HE WOULD STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF BEING CONSIDERED THE PERSONIFICATION OF GENEROSITY
DE GUICHE TO ADMIT THAT FEW MEN AT THE COURT OF FRANCE COULD HOPE TO EQUAL HIM
I APPEAL TO ALL THE LADIES PRESENT AND NOT ONE OF THEM I AM SURE WILL CONTRADICT ME THE KING WHO WAS MUCH DISTURBED BY WHAT HE SUSPECTED WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW SIGNIFIED HIS ASSENT BY A GESTURE
THE IMMENSE COURTYARDS FORMERLY SILENT AND DESOLATE WERE NOW THRONGED WITH COURTIERS WHOSE HORSES WERE PACING AND PRANCING TO AND FRO
DO YOU PITY M
BUT AS HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF THE LITTLE COURT HE NEARLY KNOCKED AGAINST MADAME WHOSE RADIANT FACE SEEMED FULL OF CHARMING REVELATIONS BENEATH THE MANTLE WHICH PROTECTED WITHOUT CONCEALING HER
DE MALICORNE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE PISTOL-HOLSTERS MALICORNE WAS A MAN OF GREAT READINESS AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS
3 SO I AM SAID THE GOVERNOR
SO THAT IN THIS WAY THE SENTINEL COULD CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT NO ONE QUITTED THE BASTILE IMPROPERLY
IN THE FIVE-VOLUME EDITION VOLUME 2 ENDS HERE FOOTNOTE 5
THAT WAS THEN YOUR REASON FOR COMING HERE
AFTER THAT WE ARE FREE TO HAVE A HEART WHEN WE ONLY HAVE THAT LEFT OH OH MURMURED LA VALLIERE
TELL ME THE TRUTH I IMPLORE YOU
YOU ARE VERY POLITE SAID MALICORNE
AS SOON AS THE CHEVALIER WHO HAD A SECRET DISLIKE FOR HIM AS FOR EVERY OTHER NOBLE CHARACTER PERCEIVED HIM ENTER HE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT
A FAIR PROPORTION OF THE CAVALIERS RELEASED FROM THE RESTRAINT ETIQUETTE HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM GAVE THE REIN TO THEIR HORSES AND DARTED AFTER THE CARRIAGES WHICH BORE THE MAIDS OF HONOR AS BLOOMING AS SO MANY VIRGIN HUNTRESSES AROUND DIANA AND THE HUMAN WHIRLWIND LAUGHING CHATTERING AND NOISY PASSED ONWARD
IF YOU HAD NOT COME I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO YOU
THEY WERE SOME OF THE COURTIERS WHO HAD BEEN SENT BY THE QUEEN AND MADAME AND UNCOVERED THEMSELVES IN TOKEN OF HAVING PERCEIVED HIS MAJESTY
I DO NOT REQUIRE ANYTHING MADAME
ATHENAIS IS FRANK TO-NIGHT SAID MONTALAIS
I DO RETURNED ARAMIS
MATTERS WENT ON BETTER UNDER HIM
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO WHAT I MEAN
I DO NOT SAY THAT HE SHALL NOT MARRY MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE BUT I DO NOT WISH HIM TO MARRY SO YOUNG
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT UNTIL OUR JOURNEY IS AT AN END EVERY DEMONSTRATION OF THAT NATURE IS USELESS
MONTALAIS WAS NOT MALICIOUS ENOUGH TO REJOICE EXTRAVAGANTLY AT HER VICTORY OR TO OVERWHELM THE CONQUERED ENEMY PARTICULARLY WHEN THAT ENEMY WAS THE MOTHER OF HER FRIEND
MAKE AN EFFORT PRAY DO AND DO SO AT ONCE MY DEAR IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISPLAY MORE PERSUASIVE ELOQUENCE THAN SAINT-AIGNAN DID BUT SOMETHING STILL MORE POWERFUL AND OF A MORE ENERGETIC NATURE THAN THIS ELOQUENCE AROUSED LA VALLIERE
AND THIS COMMISSION IS GIVEN YOU CONTINUED THE KING NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR JOURNEY TO BELLE-ISLE BUT MOREOVER FOR YOUR BRAVE INTERVENTION AT THE PLACE DE GREVE
TO CALL YOURSELF MALICORNE THE FIRST NO
TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS THE OTHER VESSELS HAD OVERTAKEN THE FLAGSHIP AND THE THREE NOT VENTURING PERHAPS TO ENTER THE NARROW ENTRANCE OF THE HARBOR CAST ANCHOR BETWEEN LE HAVRE AND LA HEVE
FOR INDEED SIRE WE ARE DOING NO HARM AND HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING ANY AND SHE LOOKED AT THE KING WITH THAT PROUD YET PROVOKING GLANCE THAT KINDLES DESIRE IN THE COLDEST AND WISEST OF MEN
IT WAS I HE SAID BOWING WITH MARKED RESPECT
YOUR WIFE HAS NO LOVER
I WISHED TO COME HERE YESTERDAY BUT I WAS NOT ABLE AS I WAS TOO FATIGUED CONTINUED ARAMIS
BUT DO NOT BE UNJUST MONSEIGNEUR AND DO NOT ATTACH ANY UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO IT
MALICORNE REPEATED TO HER SO OFTEN HIS PROTESTATION OF INDIFFERENCE THAT SHE FINISHED SOMETIMES BY BELIEVING HIM
YOUR HAND WHICH OFTEN MEETS MY OWN DOES NOT EXCITE IN ME THAT AGITATION AND EMOTION WHICH IS THE CASE WITH THOSE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER FOR INSTANCE ENOUGH SAID THE KING ENOUGH I ENTREAT YOU
THERE WAS NO SERVANT TO BE SEEN ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT EVERYTHING WAS PREPARED AS THOUGH SOME INVISIBLE GENIUS HAD DIVINED THE WISHES AND DESIRES OF AN EXPECTED GUEST
YOU WILL NEVER MAKE ME BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY GOOD ROOMS IN THE BASTILE
I FEEL VERY ILL AND I THINK I AM ABOUT TO DIE THE PHYSICIAN TOOK THE MONK'S HAND AND FELT HIS PULSE
FOR THE FACT IS THAT LAST EVENING SHE WISHED TO HAVE SOME PRIVATE CONVERSATION IN OUR ROOM AND I WAS GOING THERE AFTER THE MANICAMP AND MALICORNE COLLOQUIES TERMINATED WHEN I LEARNED ON MY RETURN RATHER LATE IT IS TRUE THAT MADAME HAD SEQUESTERED HER MAIDS OF HONOR AND THAT WE WERE TO SLEEP IN HER APARTMENTS INSTEAD OF OUR OWN
IT HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO THREE FOUR OR FIVE VOLUMES AT VARIOUS POINTS IN ITS HISTORY
I IMPLORE YOU THEREFORE SEEK THE DUKE AND IF IT IS NECESSARY TO ENTREAT HIM TO ACCEPT MY OFFER I WILL DO SO THAT IS USELESS
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY BETTER INFORMED THAN I AM MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE AND IT IS BECAUSE I AM BETTER INFORMED THAN YOURSELF CHEVALIER THAT I INSIST UPON DE GUICHE LEAVING NO NO
IT IS REALLY THE FACT ARAMIS SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INCREDULITY
THEREFORE YOU BELIEVE SHE SAID THAT I PRE-ARRANGED THIS RIDICULOUS THIS INFAMOUS PLOT OF TRIFLING IN SO SHAMELESS A MANNER WITH YOUR MAJESTY NAY SAID THE KING IT WAS NEITHER RIDICULOUS NOR INFAMOUS
D'ARTAGNAN YOU WILL SETTLE YOUR QUARREL WITH ME I ADMIRE YOUR PRUDENCE MONSIEUR REPLIED DE WARDES WITH A BITTER SMILE
A COQUETTE FROM INSTINCT
MY DREAMS ARE ALWAYS GOOD,--I SLEEP SO LITTLE WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM?--BUT ARE YOU SUFFERING NO SAID THE QUEEN STIFLING WITH WONDERFUL COMMAND THE TORTURE OF A RENEWED ATTACK OF SHOOTING PAINS IN HER BOSOM
BUT TO LOVERS IT IS FULL OF ADVANTAGE
AND AS THE PRINCESS AFFECTED DIFFICULTY IN MOUNTING THE KING TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT MADAME'S ARM WAS CLASPED LIKE A CIRCLET OF ALABASTER AROUND THE KING'S NECK
AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT DAY HAS NOW ARRIVED AH
IT MAY BE CONCEALED BUT IT CAN BE LOOKED FOR BOUGHT AND FOUND YOU SEE THINGS ON THE BRIGHT SIDE AND SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR YOU
LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE WELL ASKED THE KING TAKING THE LETTER FROM SAINT-AIGNAN'S HANDS WHO WAS COMPLETELY BEWILDERED BY WHAT HE HAD JUST READ
REALLY MONSEIGNEUR IT IS YOU WHOM THIS DEVICE WOULD BEST SUIT WHERE IS DE GUICHE HE CANNOT BE FOUND
EACH OF THE THREE GOSSIPS HAD HER ADVENTURE ONLY I IMAGINED THE HERO OF THIS ONE'S ADVENTURE WAS MALICORNE AND NOT MANICAMP AT HER COMPANION'S APPEAL MONTALAIS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF HER DESCENT AND SAINT-AIGNAN COULD OBSERVE THE UNFORTUNATE MANICAMP CLIMB FROM ONE BRANCH OF THE CHESTNUT-TREE TO ANOTHER EITHER TO IMPROVE HIS SITUATION OR TO OVERCOME THE FATIGUE CONSEQUENT UPON HIS INCONVENIENT POSITION
I HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THE FATHER
SAINT-AIGNAN WAS SUFFICIENTLY RESPECTFUL NOT TO LOOK ON
THEREFORE DO YOU GUESS NOW I CANNOT CONJECTURE WHAT YOU MEAN AND YET NOTHING IS MORE SIMPLE
HELP WAS AGAIN REPEATED
IT IS NOW SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE SAID
FOR THE FUTURE YOU SHALL BE SO FAR ABOVE ALL THOSE THAT FAR FROM INSPIRING YOU WITH FEAR THEY SHALL BE EVEN BENEATH YOUR PITY AND HE BOWED AS REVERENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE LEAVING A PLACE OF WORSHIP
WHY REALLY MONSIEUR SAID THE KING LAUGHING I THINK I DO MORE THAN ACCEPT
SOME OF THE OLDER COURTIERS REMEMBERED HAVING SEEN HIS FATHER BUT THEIR RECOLLECTIONS WERE NOT PREJUDICIAL TO THE SON
AN ADDITIONAL REASON RETURNED COLBERT
THE LOVER WHO A LITTLE WHILE SINCE WAS PUFFED UP WITH PRIDE IN A MINUTE AFTERWARDS IS SUFFERING AT EVERY PORE OF HIS VANITY AND SELF-ESTEEM
VILLIERS SHE SAID IN ENGLISH WITH A VEHEMENCE OF TONE WHICH NOTHING COULD RESIST WHAT IS IT YOU ASK
IN EXACT PROPORTION HOWEVER AS MADAME SUSPECTED THIS CHANGE OF FEELING SHE REDOUBLED HER ACTIVITY TO REGAIN THE RAY OF LIGHT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LOSE
WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE COURT
HE DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE CORDIAL FOR HE DARTED OUT OF THE ROOM AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE STAIRCASE
D'ARTAGNAN YOU SURPRISE ME BAISEMEAUX
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT MY DAUGHTER AND SHE TURNED TOWARDS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WHOM SHE WOULD BY MAIN FORCE HAVE DRAGGED AWAY FROM MONTALAIS AND WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE IMPULSE OF MADAME DE SAINT-REMY LOOKED FIRST AT HER MOTHER AND THEN AT MONTALAIS WITH HER BEAUTIFUL CONCILIATORY EYES
I DO NOT SPEAK ON ANY ONE'S BEHALF BUT MY OWN WHEN I TELL YOU TO LEAVE
YOU SEE YOU ARE KEEPING US WAITING LISTEN THEN:--MY FATHER LOVED A LADY OF NOBLE BIRTH AND THIS LADY LOVED MY FATHER D'ARTAGNAN AND ATHOS EXCHANGED LOOKS
A SUNBEAM WE SAY DESCENDED UPON THEM DRAWING PERFUMES FROM THE NEIGHBORING FLOWERS AND ANIMATING THE WALLS THEMSELVES
TAKE CARE MONSIEUR I KNOW HIM
LE COMTE DE GUICHE WILL TAKE UPON HIM TO OBTAIN AT SIGHT
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM OBEDIENT TO THE QUEEN-MOTHER'S INVITATION PRESENTED HIMSELF IN HER APARTMENTS HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE DUC D'ORLEANS
YOUR MAJESTY PERMITS YOURSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY FLATTERY NO ONE WILL EVER SAY IT IS A MEANS YOU MAKE USE OF FORGIVE MY STUPIDITY SIRE COME
WILL YOU BET I SHALL HAVE THE COMTE'S LETTER IN EIGHT HOURS YES IN HAND IN HAND WELL BE IT SO
COLBERT SAID THE KING
THAT MAY BE ADMITTED ALSO LASTLY;--IF MONSIEUR WERE TO WIN THEM OH SAID MADAME LAUGHING HEARTILY HE WOULD GIVE THEM TO THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE ANNE OF AUSTRIA LAUGHED AS HEARTILY AS HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
OH HOW BEAUTIFUL HOW MAGNIFICENT THESE BRACELETS ARE EXCLAIMED MONTALAIS
BECAUSE THE SAME EYES THAT HAVE SEEN YOU ALREADY MIGHT SEE YOU AGAIN
THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH FOUQUET HAD CARRIED ON WITH SO MUCH MODERATION YET WITH EXTREME TACT INSPIRED THE KING WITH THE HIGHEST ESTEEM FOR THE CHARACTER OF THE MAN AND THE CAPACITY OF THE MINISTER
GIVE ME A SIMPLE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FOR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WHEN TO BE MADE PAYABLE WHEN I REQUIRE IT
MORDIOUX CRIED D'ARTAGNAN THAT WAS WELL SPOKEN
DE WARDES AND YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME STILL FURTHER THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS FULL OF EAGER CURIOSITY DREW CLOSER
THERE IS TOO MUCH LEFT IN IT OF WHAT THE GRAND COUNCIL DESIRED YOU TO PUT IN GRISART AMAZED OVERCOME COMPLETELY ASTOUNDED ALMOST FELL BACKWARDS IN HIS EXTREME TERROR
AND WITH THAT SWORD WHEN A BEFITTING TIME ARRIVES I WILL AVENGE HIS NAME--A NAME YOU HAVE DISHONORED TAKE CARE MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
I WILL TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW LATER AND AS IT IS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE YOU CAN WAIT
IN TRUTH MADAME I HAVE NEVER YET GIVEN YOU THE RIGHT TO INSULT ME IN THIS MANNER INSULT YOU SHE SAID TURNING PALE WHAT SINGULAR DELICACY OF FEELING
DO NOT BELIEVE HE IS JEALOUS
VERY WELL I ADMIT THAT IS A REASON
MONSIEUR ON REACHING THE CARRIAGE WAS STRUCK BY HER BEAUTY
TOBY IS A TRAITOR
AND I SHALL SAY TO THE KING
THAT IS PLAIN ENOUGH BUT I WANT ONE--I MUST HAVE ONE OH
I HAVE SAVED YOU REPLIED THE LATTER WHILST FOUQUET ASCENDED THE FLIGHT OF STEPS AND INQUIRED WHETHER THE KING WAS STILL VISIBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE LET US SUPPLY OUR READERS WITH A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE INN CALLED BEAU PAON
I THOUGHT THEM ALL ABOUT THE SAME DO YOU MEAN THEN THAT AMONG THAT BRILLIANT ASSEMBLY THE FIRST COURT IN THE WORLD NO ONE PLEASED YOU I DO NOT SAY THAT TELL US THEN WHO YOUR IDEAL IS IT IS NOT AN IDEAL BEING HE EXISTS THEN IN VERY TRUTH EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE AROUSED AND EXCITED
THE SHEPHERDESSES I WAS SAYING NOTICING HOW INDISCREET THE TWO SHEPHERDS WERE PROCEEDED TO SIT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE ROYAL OAK
BUT THE SONGS WHICH THE SPANISH PRINCESS HAD SUNG WITH TEARS IN HER EYES THE YOUNG ENGLISHWOMAN WAS HUMMING WITH A SMILE THAT WELL DISPLAYED HER BEAUTIFUL TEETH
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST TOLD ME IS PERHAPS SUFFICIENT FOR WHAT IS DUE TO AN AFFILIATED MEMBER EVEN OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR
THAT MADAME HAD THE GREATEST RESPECT THE SINCEREST AFFECTION FOR HIM
SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID BAISEMEAUX WITH A SIGH
THE TIDE OF PROSPERITY IS SETTING IN ON YOU
AH HIS MAJESTY ADDED BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE ANY COMMISSIONS WHICH MADAME MAY HAVE FOR THE KING HER BROTHER GRACIOUS HEAVEN MURMURED LOUISE MUCH AGITATED AND YET FULL OF THOUGHT AT THE SAME TIME
AND IT SEEMS NECESSARY AT THE PRESENT TIME THAT BUCKINGHAM THE SON SHOULD CONSECRATE BY THE DEVOTION OF HIS WORSHIP THE BEAUTY OF A PRINCESS WHO HAS FRENCH BLOOD IN HER VEINS
ANNE RAN TOWARDS HIM AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND
THE FATHER OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE IS M
AND BECAUSE MY HOUR HAS NOT YET COME LOUISE LOUISE SAID MONTALAIS TAKE CARE OR I WILL REMIND YOU OF THE REMARK YOU MADE JUST NOW
HAD MADAME THEREFORE BEEN THE INSTIGATOR OF THE REVENGE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT
IT SEEMS IT IS THE BATHS THAT HAVE PUT HER OUT AND HE ENDEAVORED TO PUT TOGETHER THE DISCONNECTED PHRASES WHICH HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW I SUPPOSE WHAT IS CALLED A CHAPERON IN MATTERS OF LOVE
AS MANY FOR COMING BACK TWENTY-EIGHT
DE GUICHE HAD OVERHEARD EVERYTHING
THEY WERE RELEASED FROM THEIR ATTENDANCE AND HAD CHANGED THEIR COSTUMES OF NYMPHS
INSTINCTIVE DISLIKES HOWEVER ARE RELENTLESS
COLBERT IS AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNTANT AT THIS COMMENDATION BESTOWED BY THE TRADUCED ON THE TRADUCER THE KING FELT HIMSELF PENETRATED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ADMIRATION
I AM TIRED OF INVESTING MY MONEY IN LANDS AND AM ANXIOUS TO INTRUST IT TO SOME FRIEND WHO WILL TURN IT TO ACCOUNT SURELY IT DOES NOT PRESS SAID M
WELL SAID THE LATTER M
RAOUL I KNOW THAT YOU USED ON YOUR SIDE TO SHOW THE SAME FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS ME AND HAD THE SAME CONFIDENCE IN ME
THAT TYRCIS WAS AS SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER MEN AS THE OAK TO ALL OTHER TREES AS THE LILY IN ITS MAJESTY TO ALL OTHER FLOWERS
BUT LOUIS NOTWITHSTANDING LA VALLIERE'S CONFUSION DID NOT QUIT HIS RESPECTFUL AND TENDER ATTITUDE
THAT IS NOT A PROVINCIAL CUT I PRESUME
WHILE THE CONFESSOR OBEYED THE FRANCISCAN INSTEAD OF STRIKING OUT THE CARDINAL'S NAME AS HE HAD DONE THE BARON'S MADE A CROSS AT THE SIDE OF IT
AND I RECOGNIZED THE VOICE WHICH PRONOUNCED MY NAME IN SUCH TENDER ACCENTS
BESIDES FASHIONS PASS AWAY MONSIEUR AND THE FASHION OF DUELLING HAS PASSED AWAY WITHOUT REFERRING IN ANY WAY TO THE EDICTS OF HIS MAJESTY WHICH FORBID IT
THE KING WHO IS AS PLEASED WITH YOUR RESISTANCE AS WITH YOUR CAPITULATION
AND THEREUPON A CURIOUS SPECTACLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED
MALICORNE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED AND OBSERVED BORNE UPON A LITTER THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRANCISCAN WHOSE INSTALLATION IN HIS APARTMENT HE HAD WITH A FEW DETAILS OF HIS OWN RELATED TO MONTALAIS AND WHOM HE HAD SO USELESSLY ENDEAVORED TO CONVERT TO HUMBLER VIEWS
BEFORE HE COULD CALL AFTER HIS MOTHER HE MUST OPEN HIS LIPS AND HE NEVER SAYS A WORD LET US GO IN THEN SAID ARAMIS GLOOMILY
YOU ARE A MUSKETEER STILL TO THE VERY TIPS OF YOUR FINGERS WHILE I HAVE BECOME A BISHOP
FOUQUET WAITED WITHOUT SHOWING DISCOMPOSURE
AMONG THE NUMBER WAS ONE WHICH HE HOPED AND FEARED NEARLY TO AN EQUAL EXTENT
MY MOTHER EVEN JOINS MY ENEMIES YOUR MOTHER PHILIP SEES FURTHER IN THE MATTER THAN YOU DO AND DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ADVISING YOU SINCE YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO HER I WILL GO TO THE KING I WAS ABOUT TO PROPOSE THAT TO YOU
BUT AS MALICORNE HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS VERY BEST COSTUME HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY OTHER THAN A SUIT OF VIOLET VELVET TRIMMED WITH SILVER
DE SAINT-AIGNAN AND SHE HURRIED AWAY ALONE AND ALMOST SUFFOCATED BY PAINFUL EMOTION TOWARDS THE CHATEAU
NAY I WOULD SAY IT EVEN TO MADAME HERSELF
COMTE DO NOT FLATTER HIM IF YOU LIKE
MY LORD PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU THAT I COMMAND HERE ARE YOU AWARE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING MY LORD REPLIED BUCKINGHAM HAUGHTILY
MANICAMP LOOKED AT HIM
A STORM WAS BREWING IN THAT DIRECTION THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE IN THE MIDST OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WAS ANALYZING WITH DELIGHT CONTRIBUTING TO THE WEAKER AND ACTING ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WICKED DESIGNS IN SUCH A MANNER WITH REGARD TO THE STRONGER AS TO PRODUCE THE MOST DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES POSSIBLE
SHE CONJURED UP THE SWEETEST DREAMS
YOU SPOKE JUST NOW OF THE HONOR OF A WOMAN AND OF THE HONOR OF YOUR FATHER
BUT NO HE SAID WITH THE SAME UNALTERED SMILE NO NO YOU CANNOT SEE AND CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT BELIEVE--WHAT I TELL YOU AND ARAMIS ROSE TO WITHDRAW
IF MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WERE RECOGNIZED I MUST HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED ALSO
MALICORNE WOULD BE OFFICER TO MONSIEUR
AND WHAT IS MORE YOU CAN SLEEP THERE AS LONG AND AS TRANQUILLY AS YOU PLEASE WHAT
WHEN YOU RETURN TO-MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN I LEAVE YOU THEN SAID RAOUL AS HE WITHDREW
NAY MADAME UNDECEIVE YOURSELF SAID LOUIS TAKING THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND
THE LANDLORD ON HEARING THESE WORDS HAD SMILED AS IF HE WERE PERFECTLY WELL ACQUAINTED EITHER WITH MALICORNE OR HIS FRIEND THE NOBLEMAN AND HAD SAID TO HIM SINCE YOU ARE THE FIRST ARRIVAL MONSIEUR CHOOSE WHAT APARTMENT YOU PLEASE AND THIS WAS SAID WITH THAT OBSEQUIOUSNESS OF MANNERS SO FULL OF MEANING WITH LANDLORDS WHICH MEANS MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY MONSIEUR
HER PARTNER WAS M
I RECEIVED YOUR LETTERS AND RETURNED THEM TO YOU ADDING A FEW WORDS PROMISING YOU A SURPRISE
THE RESULT WAS THAT MONSIEUR--WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS AND COMPLETELY RESTORED SINCE GUICHE'S DEPARTURE--SUBSIDED INTO HIS MELANCHOLY STATE THREE DAYS AFTER THE COURT WAS INSTALLED AT FONTAINEBLEAU
HIS DISPOSITION NATURALLY LIGHT AND CHEERFUL HAS BECOME GLOOMY AND MELANCHOLY
AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BOWING WITH THE PROFOUNDEST RESPECT HE EXCLAIMED,--"IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE HERE MONSEIGNEUR
IT WAS LA VALLIERE MADAME STARTED AS IF SHE HAD NOT KNOWN IT PERFECTLY WELL ALREADY
BUT WHEN OTHERS FORSAKE ME AND LAUGH AT THEIR INFIDELITY I LOVE DISTRACTEDLY MADAME DE BELLIERE COULD NOT RESTRAIN AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO BE TRUE WHAT
AND AS THESE HOUSES ARE LET THEY BELONG TO ME AND AS I HIRED THEM IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT OF FREE ACCESS TO THE HOTEL DE VILLE YOU ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IN PREVENTING ME PASSING TO IT BUT WHO PREVENTS YOU PASSING MONSIEUR INQUIRED MANICAMP
YOU ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE KING OF ENGLAND
BEHIND MADAME DE SAINT-REMY STOOD MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
AT THE EXPIRATION OF AN HOUR'S STRUGGLING WITH THE WAVES IT REACHED THE SPOT WHERE THE ADMIRAL'S VESSEL WAS ANCHORED AND FROM THE SIDE OF WHICH TWO BOATS HAD ALREADY BEEN DISPATCHED TOWARDS THEIR AID
I UNDERSTAND YOU WISHED TO ASSURE YOURSELF OF THIS GOOD FEELING BEFORE YOU CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR FETES I HAVE ARRIVED HOWEVER SOMEWHAT LATE TO ENJOY THEM
HERE HE SAID RETURNING HIM THE APPOINTMENT BUT I GIVE IT ON ONE CONDITION NAME IT THAT YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE CHEVALIER WILLINGLY SAID GUICHE
AND THEN RESUMING THE CONVERSATION WHERE IT HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN INTERRUPTED HE SAID YOU WERE OBSERVING THAT THE LETTER WE WROTE LAST EVENING MUST BY THIS TIME HAVE REACHED ITS DESTINATION I WAS SAYING THAT SHE CERTAINLY HAS IT WHOM DID YOU SEND IT BY BY MY OWN SERVANT AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU DID HE BRING BACK AN ANSWER I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE
THE CONSENT OF ATHOS
WELL SHE SAID WHAT ELSE I WISH DE GUICHE TO BE DISMISSED FROM MY HOUSEHOLD AS BUCKINGHAM WAS AND I SHALL ASK THE KING UNLESS UNLESS WHAT UNLESS YOU MY DEAR MOTHER WHO ARE SO CLEVER AND SO KIND WILL EXECUTE THE COMMISSION YOURSELF I WILL NOT DO IT PHILIP WHAT MADAME LISTEN PHILIP
THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS DOWN AND THE DUTY OF THE DAY WAS ABOUT BEING ENTERED UPON
YOU SEE THEN LOUISE THAT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BETWEEN YOUNG GIRLS EXPOSED TO SUCH A DANGER AS THE ONE IN QUESTION THE MOST PERFECT CONFIDENCE SHOULD EXIST IN ORDER THAT THOSE HEARTS WHICH ARE NOT DISPOSED TOWARDS MELANCHOLY MAY WATCH OVER THOSE LIKELY TO BECOME SO SILENCE SILENCE SAID LA VALLIERE
I DO NOT SAY THAT REPLIED THE DOCTOR
ONCE MORE FORGIVE ME VICOMTE
BUT THE QUEEN WAS UNMOVED
THE LATIN TRANSLATES TO THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK FOOTNOTE 7
RAOUL SO THAT HE BELIEVED YOU WERE STILL AT BLOIS WHILE YOU WERE HERE IN PARIS AND HAD NO IDEA WHATEVER INDEED HOW HIGH YOU HAD RISEN IN RANK DID YOU NOT INFORM M
SIRE I PERCEIVED IT AND DO YOU KNOW THE REASON PERFECTLY WELL
FOUQUET THE ABBE OR THE SUPERINTENDENT BAISEMEAUX ALMOST MADE UP HIS MIND TO TELL AN UNTRUTH BUT HE COULD NOT SUMMON COURAGE TO DO SO
I AM GOING TO PARIS AND THAT WORD PARIS RECALLS TO YOUR MIND A CERTAIN CAVALIER AURE A CERTAIN CAVALIER WHO FORMERLY LIVED NEAR BLOIS AND WHO NOW RESIDES AT PARIS IN TRUTH I KNOW NOT WHAT AILS ME BUT I FEEL STIFLED WEEP THEN WEEP AS YOU CANNOT GIVE ME A SMILE LOUISE RAISED HER SWEET FACE WHICH THE TEARS ROLLING DOWN ONE AFTER THE OTHER ILLUMINED LIKE DIAMONDS
SINCE THE DEPARTURE HOWEVER OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY BY MEANS OF HIS ALLIANCE WITH THE KING MONSIEUR HAD TO SUBMIT TO A BURDEN HEAVIER BUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT SENSE TO HIS FORMER ONE
A WOMAN WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF MY BEING EXILED WHAT A REVENGEFUL DISPOSITION YOU HAVE DE GUICHE HOW VIRULENTLY YOU BEAR MALICE I SHOULD LIKE THE CASE TO BE YOUR OWN MONSEIGNEUR DECIDEDLY THEN THAT WAS THE REASON WHY YOU DANCED SO BADLY YESTERDAY
BE CAREFUL
NOTHING IS CLEARER THAN THAT I WILL DO BETTER SAINT-AIGNAN WHAT IS THAT SIRE PUT ON YOUR CLOAK BUT SIRE YOU KNOW THE SUITE OF ROOMS WHERE MADAME'S MAIDS OF HONOR ARE LODGED CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SOME MEANS OF OBTAINING AN ENTRANCE THERE AS FAR AS THAT IS CONCERNED I DO NOT AT ALL EVENTS YOU MUST BE ACQUAINTED WITH SOME ONE THERE REALLY YOUR MAJESTY IS THE SOURCE OF EVERY GOOD IDEA YOU DO KNOW SOME ONE THEN
BUT ALTHOUGH MONSIEUR ALSO LOOKED VERY HANDSOME STILL HE COULD NOT BE COMPARED TO THE COUNT
THIS GENTLEMAN IS AN ARCHITECT WHO HAS COME TO EXAMINE YOUR CHIMNEY SAID BAISEMEAUX
YOU SHALL READ ME YOUR VERSES
LA VALLIERE WAS SALUTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE OTHERS BUT WITH NEITHER MORE NOR LESS ATTENTION
I ACCEPT THE DOWRY AND TAKE THE WOMAN WITH IT SAID THE MARQUISE THROWING HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS
MADAME HAD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES IN THE WORLD
YOUR FRIEND WILL SETTLE FOR HIS APARTMENT AND YOU FOR YOUR OWN MAY I BE BROKEN ALIVE ON THE WHEEL SAID MALICORNE TO HIMSELF IF I UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT IT AND THEN HE SAID ALOUD WELL THEN ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE NAME WITH WHAT NAME WITH THE NAME AT THE END OF THE LETTER
A LITTLE WHILE SINCE WHEN ON BOARD THE ADMIRAL'S SHIP YOU WEARIED THE QUEEN AND EXHAUSTED THE ADMIRAL'S PATIENCE
AND INSTEAD OF SELLING THEM FOR THIRTY PISTOLES I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE FIFTEEN SELL THEM FOR WHATEVER YOU LIKE BUT I MUST HAVE A SECOND COMMISSION OF MAID OF HONOR GOOD
THINK OF WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE GUICHE--CERTAINLY OF IF YOUR BROTHER HEARD YOU HE WOULD CONSPIRE AGAINST YOU AS YOUR UNCLE DID AGAINST YOUR FATHER NO
OSTENSIBLY IT IS LADEN WITH CHOCOLATE IN REALITY WITH GOLD
DE BELLIERE PRESENTED TO YOU ON YOUR MARRIAGE
THE LATTER AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO ARAMIS'S REQUEST BEGGED HIM TO WAIT A MOMENT THEN WENT AWAY A SHORT DISTANCE BUT RETURNED TO ASK HIS NAME
AND WHEN THE HUSBAND SUDDENLY FINDS THAT HE HAS AS A COMPANION THE MOST DEVOTED AND THE KINDEST OF MEN WHO A WEEK BEFORE WAS WITH HIM AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
ANNE OF AUSTRIA TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND IN A VOICE FULL OF PLAYFULNESS SAID DO YOU KNOW SIRE THAT I AM PROUD OF BEING A SPANISH WOMAN WHY MADAME BECAUSE SPANISH WOMEN ARE WORTH MORE THAN ENGLISH WOMEN AT LEAST EXPLAIN YOURSELF SINCE YOUR MARRIAGE YOU HAVE NOT I BELIEVE HAD A SINGLE REPROACH TO MAKE AGAINST THE QUEEN CERTAINLY NOT AND YOU TOO HAVE BEEN MARRIED SOME TIME
BUT REALLY YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE THAN WITH MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO MEN TO WHOM I WOULD GIVE THIS KEY
FLY FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE CARDINAL PALE AND DISTURBED ENTERED THE LITTLE ROOM
THE LATTER AND EVEN MORE MINUTELY MONSIEUR GAVE THE BRACELETS A LONG LOOK OF ANXIOUS AND ALMOST COVETOUS DESIRE
BLUSH BEFORE ME WHY SHOULD YOU BLUSH CAN I HAVE DECEIVED MYSELF SAID FOUQUET
EVERYTHING HAS ITS COMMENCEMENTS
THE KING TOOK ONE OF HER HANDS IN HIS AND KISSED THE TEARS AWAY
OH SAID FOUQUET PROMPTLY YOUR MAJESTY IS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE OBSCURE NAME OF ONE OF YOUR MOST FAITHFUL AND VALUABLE SERVANTS NO I CONFESS I AM NOT
IN HER EYES THE MOMENT SEEMED TO HAVE ARRIVED FOR AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE POOR VICTIM OF THE INJUSTICE OF THE MORNING
LET OLD MEN WHOM WE READ OF IN COMEDIES FANCY THEMSELVES ADORED BY COQUETTES
YOU WHO ARE SUCH AN IDLE FELLOW IN OTHER WORDS A MAN WITH A MIND FULL OF INGENIOUS DEVICES I AM GETTING MY INGENUITY READY THEN MY DEAR COMTE THIS IS THE STATE OF THE CASE THEN
IS IT NOT VEXATIONS FOR US THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR SOVEREIGN MASTER TO WITNESS THE DEVOTION OF AN ENGLISHMAN TO OUR FUTURE MISTRESS THE SECOND LADY IN POINT OF RANK IN THE KINGDOM YES YOU ARE RIGHT
AMIDST ALL THIS HESITATION OF PURPOSE BRAGELONNE AS THOUGH A PERFECT STRANGER TO THE SCENE REMAINED ON HIS HORSE SOMEWHAT IN THE REAR OF GUICHE AND WATCHED THE RAYS OF LIGHT REFLECTED ON THE WATER INHALING WITH RAPTURE THE SEA BREEZES AND LISTENING TO THE WAVES WHICH NOISILY BROKE UPON THE SHORE AND ON THE BEACH TOSSING THE SPRAY INTO THE AIR WITH A NOISE THAT ECHOED IN THE DISTANCE
WHY NOT THERE ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED TICKETS SO THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INSCRIBE EVERY ONE'S NAME ON THE LIST AND HERS IS NOT THERE THEN NO WHAT A PITY
IN SEVEN HOURS YOU HAVE THE LETTER FROM THE COMTE AND I SHALL HAVE WON MY WAGER WITHOUT STIRRING FROM MY BED WHICH SUITS ME AND YOU TOO AT THE SAME TIME I AM VERY SURE DECIDEDLY MANICAMP YOU ARE A GREAT MAN HEIN I KNOW THAT I AM TO START THEN FOR ETAMPES DIRECTLY I AM TO GO TO THE COMTE DE GUICHE WITH THIS ORDER HE WILL GIVE YOU A SIMILAR ONE FOR MONSIEUR MONSIEUR WILL APPROVE INSTANTLY AND I SHALL HAVE MY BREVET YOU WILL AH WELL I HOPE I BEHAVE GENTEELY ADORABLY THANK YOU YOU DO AS YOU PLEASE THEN WITH THE COMTE DE GUICHE MANICAMP EXCEPT MAKING MONEY OF HIM--EVERYTHING DIABLE THE EXCEPTION IS ANNOYING
FOR AT THAT TIME ORNAMENTATION WAS BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IN THESE POLITICAL PAGEANTS
HOW WOULD YOU REGARD US I SAID IF YOU WERE TO PERCEIVE AMONG US A MAN MAD ENOUGH DISLOYAL ENOUGH TO ENTERTAIN OTHER THAN SENTIMENTS OF THE MOST PERFECT RESPECT FOR A PRINCESS WHO IS THE DESTINED WIFE OF OUR MASTER THESE WORDS WERE SO APPLICABLE TO DE GUICHE THAT HE TURNED PALE AND OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN AGITATION WAS BARELY ABLE TO STRETCH OUT ONE HAND MECHANICALLY TOWARDS RAOUL AS HE COVERED HIS EYES AND FACE WITH THE OTHER
I GUESS THAT THE LEAST OF YOUR BUGBEARS IS YOUR STAY IN FRANCE
I KNOW THAT MONSIEUR HAS THREATENED I KNOW THAT MADAME HAS BEEN IN TEARS MADAME IN TEARS EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE IMPRUDENTLY CLASPING HIS HANDS
THANK YOU MY DEAR RAOUL HE SAID
I WAS SAYING MONSIEUR LE COMTE RESUMED BUCKINGHAM IN A TONE OF ANGER MORE MARKED THAN EVER ALTHOUGH IN SOME MEASURE MODERATED BY THE PRESENCE OF AN EQUAL I WAS SAYING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THESE TENTS CAN REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE AND WHY BECAUSE I OBJECT TO THEM A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE ESCAPED DE GUICHE BUT A WARNING GLANCE FROM RAOUL RESTRAINED HIM
WELL SAID THE COUNT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT M
BELIEVE ME IT IS NOT FATIGUE THAT SADDENS YOU TO-NIGHT IT IS ANNOYANCE THEN WHAT ANNOYANCE THAT OF THIS EVENING THE MAD CONDUCT OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM DO YOU MEAN OF COURSE
BUT CONTINUED ARAMIS I PROMISED MYSELF TO COME AND PAY YOU A VISIT TO-DAY EARLY IN THE MORNING YOU ARE REALLY VERY KIND MY LORD AND IT WAS A GOOD THING FOR ME I WAS PUNCTUAL I THINK WHAT DO YOU MEAN YES YOU WERE GOING OUT AT WHICH LATTER REMARK BAISEMEAUX COLORED AND SAID IT IS TRUE I WAS GOING OUT THEN I PREVENT YOU SAID ARAMIS
THE GIRL PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS SAYING TO HER
RAOUL INTERCEPTED THE GLANCE BUT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ITS MEANING AND NATURALLY ENOUGH ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE INTEREST BOTH THE YOUNG GIRLS TOOK IN HIM
WHY SHOULD DE GUICHE SET OFF BECAUSE AND YOU CANNOT BE IGNORANT OF IT--YOU PARTICULARLY SO BECAUSE EVERY ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE SCENE WHICH HAS PASSED BETWEEN MONSIEUR AND DE GUICHE DE GUICHE TURNED PALE
THAT SHADOW MUST BE DRIVEN AWAY THAT SMILE MUST BE QUENCHED
IS IT NOT SO YOUNG LADIES SAID THE PRINCESS TURNING TOWARDS THE LEFT OF HER ARMY
BUT SHE WAS AT MASS AND SO I PLACED THE NOTE ON HER TOILETTE-TABLE
NOT ONLY FRANCE AND SPAIN CONTINUED THE CARDINAL BUT THE WHOLE OF EUROPE EVEN WOULD BE VIOLENTLY RENT ASUNDER BY THE FAITHLESSNESS OF EITHER PARTY ANOTHER MOVEMENT OF THE DYING MAN'S HEAD
PRODUCED BY JOHN BURSEY TEN YEARS LATER BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES
WELL DE WARDES THE FATHER WITH THE BRAVERY OF HIS RACE WITH HIS DOGGED COURAGE OCCUPIED A GOOD DEAL OF MY TIME
SUDDENLY DE WARDES FELT HIS WORD ARRESTED,--HE HAD JUST TOUCHED BUCKINGHAM'S SHOULDER
MADAME SAID THE KING SIGHING HOW MUCH MORE PERFECT YOU ARE IN YOUR PART THAN I AM AND HOW ACTIVELY YOU THINK OF EVERYTHING HE THEN ROSE SAYING LOUD ENOUGH FOR EVERY ONE TO HEAR HIM PERMIT ME TO LEAVE YOU MADAME
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT MOTHER WHY NO
TWENTY YEARS AFTER
THE KING WHO WAS KNEELING BEFORE HER COVERED THE PALMS OF HER HANDS WITH THOSE BURNING KISSES WHICH ARE TO THE HANDS WHAT A KISS UPON THE LIPS IS TO THE FACE
THE YOUNG GIRLS HASTILY ROSE ALMOST TERRIFIED OUT OF THEIR SENSES
MAZARIN ON THE PART OF KING CHARLES II TO OFFER ME HIS ALLIANCE EXACTLY SIRE AND THE COMTE DE LA FERE IS A GREAT SOLDIER SAY YOU SIRE HE IS A MAN WHO HAS DRAWN HIS SWORD MORE TIMES FOR THE KING YOUR FATHER THAN THERE ARE AT PRESENT MONTHS IN THE HAPPY LIFE OF YOUR MAJESTY IT WAS LOUIS XIV
HE BECKONED TO THE SUPERINTENDENT TO COME UP AND TURNING TOWARDS LYONNE AND COLBERT HE SAID:--"FINISH THIS MATTER PLACE IT ON MY DESK AND I WILL READ IT AT MY LEISURE AND HE LEFT THE ROOM
BY THE BY I REMEMBER AN APHORISM UPON THIS SUBJECT OF POOR DR DAWLEY A CLEVER AND AMUSING MAN WHO HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY BROTHER WHO COULD NOT DO WITHOUT HIM I SHOULD HAVE WITH ME NOW
TAKE CARE PHILIP YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR GRIEVANCES
YOU CAN BE CREATED A GENTLEMAN
BUT MEN CHANGE AND YOU AT THE PRESENT DAY ARE FAR MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU FORMERLY WERE AND THEN BEGINNING TO LAUGH HE ADDED COME IF LA VALLIERE IS WILLING TO LOVE ME ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF A THIRD AND THE KING TWO-THIRDS DO YOU THINK THE CONDITION ACCEPTABLE ARAMIS ROSE IMPATIENTLY
WHEN SHE ASCENDED THE LADDER THE POETS WERE PRESENT--AND ALL WERE POETS WHEN MADAME WAS THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION--THE TWENTY POETS WHO WERE GALLOPING ABOUT STOPPED AND WITH ONE VOICE EXCLAIMED THAT PEARLS AND NOT DROPS OF WATER WERE FALLING FROM HER PERSON TO BE LOST AGAIN IN THE HAPPY RIVER
HE THEREFORE MADE USE OF HIS LAST RESOURCE
I AM INDEED FORTUNATE IN MEETING YOU I ALSO M
THERE'S MY FRIEND WHO IS COME TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HIS APARTMENT THAT IS TO SAY OF MY ROOM AND HE CALLED TO MANICAMP WHO LOOKED UP AND IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED MALICORNE
COME MONSIEUR CHAPTER XVI
AFTER ALL THESE THINGS DO NOT CONCERN ME PERSONALLY
SO YOU SEE AT YOUR FIRST SUMMONS I LEFT EVERYTHING
AFTER LUNCHEON THERE WILL BE A PROMENADE IN THE FOREST AND THEN THERE IS SUPPER AND THE BALLET AT TEN O'CLOCK I KNOW IT THE ARDOR OF MY PASSION SHALL BLAZE MORE BRILLIANTLY THAN THE FIREWORKS SHALL SHINE MORE STEADILY THAN OUR FRIEND COLBERT'S LAMPS
THE PRESENTATIONS HAD BEEN CARELESSLY MADE AND BUCKINGHAM WITH THE REST OF THE ENGLISH GENTLEMEN HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO MONSIEUR FROM WHOM THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY INDIFFERENT ATTENTION
VERY WELL GET MARRIED YOURSELF MONSIEUR CONTINUED PAINTING HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LOOKED AT THE PORTRAIT AGAIN ONCE MORE TURNED TO ADMIRE HIMSELF IN THE GLASS AND SMILED AND NO DOUBT WAS SATISFIED WITH THE COMPARISON
ANY IDEA WHICH WHEN ONCE EXPRESSED HAS THEREBY LOST ITS SAFEGUARD AND HAS BECOME VULGARIZED BY ANY MANIFESTATION OR COMMUNICATION OF IT WHATEVER NO LONGER IS THE PROPERTY OF HIM WHO GAVE IT BIRTH
YOU WISHED TO SEE ME DID YOU NOT SHE SAID
WHILE NOW I SINK IN DESPAIR UNLESS THOSE WHO REMAIN
AT A FUTURE DAY THEN YOU AS THIS SON'S WIFE WILL HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR
BUT CONFESS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME TO PARIS
LOOK AT IT AND HE HELD OUT TO HIM A MINIATURE OF THE FINEST POSSIBLE EXECUTION
BAISEMEAUX ONLY I WOULD ASK WHY ASK MY ADDRESS OF M
I SHALL CLEAR ALL THIS UP HE SAID TO HIMSELF
YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ASK
I WILL RIGHT MYSELF WHAT DO YOU CALL RIGHTING YOURSELF INQUIRED ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN ALARM
YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN THE DISCREETNESS I HAVE SHOWN INTO CONSIDERATION ALTHOUGH YOU WERE INTERESTED IN REMAINING SILENT
IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF D'ARTAGNAN'S JOKES WHO PERCEIVED IN ME THE ENGINEER OF BELLE-ISLE THEN HE ADDED ALOUD
THE PRINCE UNDERSTOOD HOW SEVERE TOWARDS HIMSELF THIS OPINION OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE WAS AND HE LOOKED SOMEWHAT DISPLEASED SAYING MY FRIENDS ARE NOT OVER INDULGENT DE GUICHE LOOKED AT THE PORTRAIT AGAIN AND AFTER LENGTHENED CONTEMPLATION RETURNED IT WITH APPARENT UNWILLINGNESS SAYING MOST DECIDEDLY MY LORD I SHOULD RATHER PREFER TO LOOK TEN TIMES AT YOUR HIGHNESS THAN TO LOOK AT MADAME ONCE AGAIN IT SEEMED AS IF THE CHEVALIER HAD DETECTED SOME MYSTERY IN THESE WORDS WHICH WERE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE PRINCE FOR HE EXCLAIMED
DE GUICHE WAS ON HIS FEET IN A MOMENT
SHE MIGHT HAVE WON THEM AND THEN SOLD THEM SOLD THEM EXCLAIMED THE QUEEN
IT IS THAT TOWER TO THE LEFT--THE SECOND ONE IS THE PRISONER AT FIFTEEN FRANCS THERE YES SINCE WHEN SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS NEARLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NEARLY
BUT I MUST BE PERMITTED TO SAY TO YOUR MAJESTY THAT IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO MAKE ME USE SUCH SPEED TO RISK TWENTY TIMES THE BREAKING OF MY NECK TO SALUTE ME ON MY ARRIVAL WITH SUCH INTELLIGENCE
YOU REALLY HAVE DRAWN SOME VERY ALARMING PICTURES FOR ME IN WHAT RESPECT ASKED THE QUEEN WITH PRETENDED SIMPLICITY
IT IS WELL KNOWN--INDEED ALL WOMEN SAY SO--THAT A WIDE DIFFERENCE INVARIABLY EXISTS BETWEEN THE GOOD LOOKS OF A LOVER AND THOSE OF A HUSBAND
THE KING HAS SOME GOOD IN HIM SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD FATHOMED THE CHARACTER OF LOUIS AND WHO PLAYED WITH HIS SELF-LOVE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS
AND IT WILL BE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT ABSORBED IN DEEP MEDITATION SHE DID NOT SEE OR RATHER PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE ANYTHING THAT WAS PASSING AROUND HER
THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE HOWEVER BETWEEN THE TWO THAT THE ONE HAD WITHDRAWN FROM A WISH TO PLEASE THE KING THE OTHER FOR A VERY OPPOSITE REASON
YOUR REMARK WAS NOT MADE IN A VERY COMPLIMENTARY MANNER VICOMTE MINE CERTAINLY
FAREWELL MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FAREWELL AND HE FLED LIKE ONE POSSESSED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAKE
IF THE INFORMATION OBTAINED WAS SATISFACTORY HE WOULD INFORM THE KING WITH ALACRITY THAT HE HAD LIGHTED UPON A PEARL AND CLAIM THE PRIVILEGE OF SETTING THE PEARL IN QUESTION IN THE ROYAL CROWN
NOW SINCE THE KING IS IN THE FIELD I WILL NOT CONTEND AGAINST THE KING NOR EVEN I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND WILL THE KING RETIRE
WE HAVE NOT YET BEGUN THE CAMPAIGN AND YOU ARE PLUNDERING ME ALREADY NO I AM ONLY RECALLING YOU TO COMMON-SENSE IDEAS
D'ARTAGNAN AND NOW AFTER I SHALL HAVE RECEIVED HIS YOU OFFER ME ONE FROM YOURSELF DO NOT DISTURB YOURSELF REPLIED RAOUL WITH CONCENTRATED ANGER
THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE CAN REFER TO THE WHOLE BOOK OR THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE THREE OR FOUR-VOLUME EDITIONS
THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION
THE DELIGHT AT BEING AT COURT THE HONOR OF BEING IN THE SERVICE OF MADAME COUNTERACT IN HER HEAD WHATEVER AFFECTION SHE MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE IN HER HEART
MALICORNE AND DE GUICHE PROCEEDED TOWARD THE DOOR DESIRING MALICORNE TO FOLLOW HIM
BUT SHE WAS OF A NOBLE FAMILY AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR MALICORNE
SOME ONE APPROACHES SOME ONE IS APPROACHING FAST IN FACT SAID MONTALAIS
ONLY M
MADAME WAS SO DISCONCERTED AT IT THAT SHE TOUCHED THE QUEEN WITH HER ELBOW SAYING AT THE SAME TIME LOOK THERE LOOK THERE THE QUEEN CLOSED HER EYES AS IF SHE HAD BEEN SUDDENLY SEIZED WITH A FAINTING-SPELL
NOT MINE CERTAINLY MY DEAR COMTE REPLIED HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS UPON MY HONOR I DID NOT ASK FOR THE KING TO EXILE YOU NO NOT YOU MONSEIGNEUR I AM WELL AWARE
SHE HOWEVER WITH HER HEAD RAISED AND WITH A STEADY UNMOVED LOOK LISTENED TO SAINT-AIGNAN AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING OF AN UTTER STRANGER
AND NOW FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MY DEAR YOUNG LADY RELIEVE ME FROM MY ANXIETY THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY IN THAT MY DEAR M
ABOUT A MONTH YOU ARE RIGHT VICOMTE SAID THE PRINCESS WITH A SMILE IN WHICH DE BRAGELONNE MIGHT HAVE REMARKED A KIND OF RESTRAINT
ARAMIS WAS GENERALLY TEMPERATE
AND FOR THIS REASON I WILL GIVE YOU A WORD OF ADVICE THAT ADVICE BEING THAT I SHOULD RETURN TO LONDON HE EXCLAIMED
OF COURSE
OF COURSE
OF COURSE
OF COURSE
IT WOULD BE INSULTING,--GIVE ME YOUR HAND DEAR LOUISE
WERE YOU CALLED UPON TO OCCUPY A QUEEN'S THRONE I SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
OH SIRE MURMURED LA VALLIERE DO YOU HEAR AND HER HEAD FELL UPON HIS SHOULDER
FOUQUET WAS PRESENT AS D'ARTAGNAN HAD SAID AT THE KING'S CARD-TABLE
ANNE FROM THIS HABIT OF PEACEABLE INTERVENTION SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING THE DISPUTES OF HER SONS AND IN SHARING AT THE SAME TIME ALL THEIR SECRETS
SUPPOSING IT TO BE A MISTAKE I SUMMONED THE LANDLORD WHO SAID THAT THE ROOM WHICH HAD BEEN LET TO ME FOR THE PAST EIGHT DAYS WAS LET TO THE FRANCISCAN FOR THE NINTH OH OH THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I SAID
NO ONE COULD HAVE TOLD
AND SO OUR MEETINGS THE PRESSURE OF EACH OTHER'S HAND THE LOOKS WE HAVE EXCHANGED--YES YES
TURN THEN NEITHER TO THE RIGHT HAND NOR TO THE LEFT BUT GO FRANKLY TO M
BUT WHEN HE PLACED HIS FOOT UPON THE WORN STONE STEPS ALONG WHICH SO MANY UNHAPPY WRETCHES HAD PASSED WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF IMPREGNATED AS IT WERE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE OF THOSE GLOOMY DUNGEONS MOISTENED WITH TEARS THERE COULD BE BUT LITTLE DOUBT HE WAS OVERCOME BY HIS FEELINGS FOR HIS HEAD WAS BOWED AND HIS EYES BECAME DIM AS HE FOLLOWED BAISEMEAUX WITHOUT A SYLLABLE
COME COME SAID D'ARTAGNAN FAMILIARLY TO RAOUL THE KING WILL ALLOW YOU TO EMBRACE ME
NO UNHAPPILY FOR ME MONSIEUR'S JEALOUSY IS OF THE WORST KIND--HE IS JEALOUS WITHOUT LOVE CONFESS HOWEVER SAID THE KING WHO BEGAN TO BE EXCITED BY THIS VARIED AND ANIMATED CONVERSATION
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
THE ONE PROCEEDED TO THE FLOWER-GARDEN WHILE THE OTHER BENT HIS STEPS TOWARDS THE WALLS
I BELIEVE SO MY LORD IS M
FOR BESIDES BEING A MAN OF MERIT I BELIEVE HIM TO BE DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY'S INTERESTS IS THAT BECAUSE HE HAS OFTEN INTERFERED WITH YOUR OWN VIEWS SAID THE KING SMILING
HERE ARE THE BILLS OF LANDING TO WHAT PORT SHALL I DIRECT IT TO BE TAKEN TO BAYONNE BEFORE THREE WEEKS ARE OVER IT SHALL BE THERE WIND AND WEATHER PERMITTING
IT IS WONDERFUL MURMURED GUICHE
JUST ABOVE THE TOPS OF THE TREES A THICK SUFFOCATING VAPOR SEEMED TO REMAIN SUSPENDED WITH BARELY SUFFICIENT POWER TO RISE THIRTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN'S RAYS WHICH WAS SCARCELY VISIBLE AS A FAINT SPOT OF LESSER DARKNESS THROUGH THE VEIL OF HEAVY MIST
FOUQUET ENTERED THE APARTMENT WITH A MANNER FULL OF RESPECT PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH THAT EASE AND GRACEFULNESS OF MANNER WHICH WAS THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MEN OF EMINENCE OF THAT PERIOD AND WHICH AT THE PRESENT DAY SEEMS NO LONGER TO BE UNDERSTOOD EVEN THROUGH THE INTERPRETATION OF THE PORTRAITS OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE PAINTER HAS ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THEM TO BEING
DID HE NOT ON HIS ARRIVAL HERE ALMOST SUCCEED IN CREATING A DISTURBANCE BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND OURSELVES
WHY SO MANY PRECAUTIONS LOOK MONSIEUR SAID THE VALET LOOK YONDER UNDER THE WALNUT-TREE AH SAID THE CHEVALIER
COME DE GUICHE YOU MUST REALLY MAKE UP YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH MY WIFE UPON MY WORD SAID MANICAMP TO HIMSELF THE PRINCE IS A HUSBAND WHOSE WIFE'S NAME WILL BRING HIM ILL-LUCK AND KING CANDAULES OF OLD WAS A TIGER BESIDE HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS AT ALL EVENTS ADDED THE PRINCE I AM SURE YOU WILL MAKE IT UP WITH MY WIFE
HOPE I HAVE AND THAT IS ALL
BUT TELL ME MY DEAR FOUQUET INSTEAD OF CONVERSING WITH THIS REPTILE AS YOU DID HIM THE HONOR OF STYLING HIM A CONVERSATION THE NEED FOR WHICH I DO NOT PERCEIVE WHY DO YOU NOT PAY A VISIT IF NOT TO THE KING AT LEAST TO MADAME TO MADAME SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT HIS MIND OCCUPIED BY HIS SOUVENIRS
THE QUEEN-MOTHER WHO WAS STILL SUFFERING MORE THAN EVER FROM THE ILLNESS WITH WHICH SHE WAS AFFLICTED DID NOT WISH TO GO OUT
SELFISH FELLOW WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME SAY AURE
LA VALLIERE'S SENSES RETURNED TO HER
YOUNG PERSONS LOVE WITH MORE VIVACITY PERHAPS WITH GREATER ARDOR AND DEEPER PASSION THAN OTHERS MORE ADVANCED IN YEARS
D'ARTAGNAN TO WHOM YOU SHALL DETAIL ALL THE CAUSES OF COMPLAINT YOU HAVE AGAINST HIM
AT A MOMENT TOO WHEN ALL THE OTHERS ARE REUNITED I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO PROPOSE RETURNING TO THE CARRIAGES MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE BUT PRAY LOOK AND LISTEN AND TELL ME IF IT BE POSSIBLE TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST PROGRESS AT PRESENT IN FACT THE THUNDER WAS STILL ROLLING AND THE RAIN CONTINUED TO FALL IN TORRENTS
HE LEANED INDOLENTLY AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE LARGE OAK AND REPLIED IN HIS SWEET AND MUSICAL VOICE ALAS MY DEAR DE GUICHE IT IS A GREAT MISFORTUNE YES CRIED THE LATTER GREAT INDEED YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME DE GUICHE
YOU UNDERSTAND IT WAS ONLY A PRETEXT
HER HEAD HOWEVER WAS NOT RAISED AGAIN CHILLED AS SHE WAS BY A COLDNESS MORE BITTER THAN THAT OF DEATH
WELL IT IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHY MY DEAR SAINT-AIGNAN YOU ARE LOSING YOUR SENSES I SHOULD THINK WHY SO I HAVE NEVER SHOWN OR TAKEN ANY INTEREST IN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE BAH NEVER DID YOU NOT OBTAIN ADMISSION FOR MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE INTO MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE--AND YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IT BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE MY DEAR COMTE--IS OF A SUFFICIENTLY GOOD FAMILY TO MAKE HER PRESENCE HERE DESIRABLE AND HER ADMITTANCE VERY EASY YOU ARE JESTING NO
HE RETURNED TO THE CHATEAU AND AS THE PROMENADE WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY AND IT WAS AT PRESENT JUST TEN O'CLOCK HE SET TO WORK DESPERATELY WITH COLBERT AND LYONNE
I AM DYING WITH UNEASINESS
AS THE KING HIMSELF ALTHOUGH HE WAS RATHER HIS ENEMY THAN HIS FRIEND TREATED M
I LAUGH AT M
OH THE DEUCE WHAT'S THE MATTER I BEG YOUR PARDON MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS BUT THIS CONFOUNDED BRANCH ABOUT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF SPEAKING TO YOU HAS JUST TORN A CERTAIN PORTION OF MY DRESS IT IS QUITE DARK REPLIED MONTALAIS LAUGHING
BUT IN THIS HOUSE DWELLS A HUSBAND WHO HAPPENS TO BE JEALOUS IS HE MORE JEALOUS THAN THE DOG CERBERUS NOT MORE BUT QUITE AS MUCH SO HAS HE THREE MOUTHS AS THAT OBDURATE GUARDIAN OF THE INFERNAL REGIONS HAD
POOR MAN
IT HAPPENS MOST FORTUNATELY MONSIEUR HE SAID THAT THE GOVERNOR IS JUST GOING OUT AND YOU CAN PERCEIVE HIS CARRIAGE WITH THE HORSES ALREADY HARNESSED IN THE COURTYARD YONDER
IF IT IS FOR YOU MADEMOISELLE FOR ME
YOU TALK LIKE PEOPLE NOT CALLED UPON TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS AND VERY PRETTY YOUR WORLD IS SAID MONTALAIS
AND WHERE DO YOU COME FROM TO BE ABLE TO TELL US THAT I COME FROM ORLEANS MADEMOISELLE AND IS THAT ALL THE NEWS YOU BRING AH NO
HE PRESERVED HIS UNMOVED AND UNCONCERNED LOOK
REMARKING THEREFORE THAT HIS OBEISANCE OBTAINED HIM NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE ADVANCED ONE STEP FURTHER AND IN A VOICE WHICH HE TRIED THOUGH VAINLY TO RENDER CALM SAID
LOOK AT THE LINES IN MY FACE BY WHICH I RECKON UP THE TRIALS I HAVE UNDERGONE
IT'S POSSIBLE REPLIED BAISEMEAUX
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SAID HE
THE NOISE OF THE FALL RESOUNDED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE ROLLING OF MARGUERITE'S CARRIAGE LEAVING THE HOTEL
BUT NOW HE WAS NOT EVEN BARELY CIVIL TO ANY OF THE COURT BEAUTIES
CAN ONE TELL IN WHAT DIRECTION THE WINDS IN THE CHANNEL WHICH TOSS MIGHTY VESSELS TO AND FRO CARRY SUCH SIGHS AS THESE
THESE STONES HE SAID MUST HAVE COST YOUR LADYSHIP AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS YOU VALUE THEM AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS NEARLY SO IT IS ABOUT WHAT I IMAGINED--BUT THE SETTINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED NO MADAME
YOU DO NOT KNOW SAID THE KING PRETENDING TO TAKE IN A SERIOUS MANNER THIS WANT OF ATTENTION FOR THE OBJECT OF HIS PREDILECTION
AND IT WAS NOW FAR WORSE THAN IN THE TIME WHEN DE GUICHE'S GUITARS WERE HEARD IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS
BUT AS IF THE REMARK HAD BEEN HEARD AND ACCEPTED DURING THE FIVE MINUTES WHICH ELAPSED AFTER THE BURST OF THUNDER WHICH HAD ALARMED THEM NO RENEWED PEAL WAS HEARD
THE REASON HE WALKED AS FAST AS HE DID WAS PROBABLY TO AVOID TOTTERING IN HIS GAIT
THE GREAT RESEMBLANCE WHICH NATURALLY EXISTED BETWEEN THE KING AND AN ORDINARY MORTAL WERE AMONG THE REASONS ASSIGNED FOR THE PRECIPITATE AND UNEXPECTED DEPARTURE OF HIS MAJESTY
ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE OF THE FOUR PATHS LEADS STRAIGHT TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS
BY THE WAY MONSIEUR IS IT TRUE THAT MLLE
MY HORSES GRIMAUD CONTINUED THE COUNT
BUT MEASURES MUST BE TAKEN TO PLACE YOU BEYOND ALL INSULT TO SHIELD YOU FROM EVERY LURE
I AM ABOUT TO FIGHT YOU BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE YOU,--BECAUSE YOU HAVE WOUNDED ME IN RIDICULING A CERTAIN DEVOTIONAL REGARD I HAVE ENTERTAINED AND ONE WHICH I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THIS MOMENT I STILL RETAIN AND FOR WHICH I WOULD VERY WILLINGLY DIE
FOOTNOTE 1
THE COURTIERS HAD EVEN WITH REGARD TO THIS SUBJECT ADOPTED VARIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF GALLANTRY TO ESTABLISH THE APHORISM THAT THE BRACELETS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRICELESS IN VALUE IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE PLACED IN CONTACT WITH ARMS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE QUEEN'S
MARGUERITE SAID OR RATHER MUTTERED A FEW WORDS WHICH MADAME DE BELLIERE DID NOT EVEN HEAR
NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER EXPRESSED HIS REAL THOUGHT
IN THE MEANTIME THEY HAD REACHED THE PALAIS ROYAL WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF LOOKERS-ON
THIS DELICACY MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED BUCKINGHAM AND CHANGED HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS DE WARDES IF THE LATTER WHILE PRESERVING SILENCE HAD SHOWN A GLANCE LESS FULL OF MALICE AND A SMILE LESS FALSE
DE GUICHE SEEMED VERY UNWILLING TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRESSING HIMSELF
DE GUICHE'S WIT AND THEN IN A LOUDER VOICE FEARFUL LEST HER UNHAPPY VICTIM MIGHT LOSE A SYLLABLE SHE SAID,--"IN THE FIRST PLACE HE DANCED BADLY AND AFTERWARDS HIS REMARKS WERE VERY SILLY SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
AND AS FOR YOUR CARPETS THEY EXIST ONLY IN YOUR IMAGINATION
OCCASIONALLY HE OBTAINED A WORD FROM MADAME AS A RECOMPENSE AND YET HER SPEECH SEEMED ALMOST A REPROACH
APPROACH CLOSER FOR THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
I REGRET TO DIFFER FROM YOU VICOMTE
NEITHER MONSIEUR NOR THE KING NOR THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WAS ANY LONGER THOUGHT OF
FOUQUET FOR MY ADDRESS EXCLAIMED ARAMIS OPENING HIS EYES IN REAL ASTONISHMENT
NO EXERCISE
THOUGH BUT A SHEPHERDESS SHE IS AS WITTY AS A PRINCESS AND AS COQUETTISH AS THE MOST FINISHED FLIRT THAT EVER LIVED
I HAVE SAID NOTHING MADAME
MY MASTER HEARD OF YOUR RETURN AND WROTE TO YOU WITHOUT DELAY
PHYLLIS SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WITH A GLANCE OF DEFIANCE AT MONTALAIS SUCH AS A FENCING-MASTER WOULD GIVE WHO INVITES AN ANTAGONIST WORTHY OF HIM TO PLACE HIMSELF ON GUARD PHYLLIS IS NEITHER FAIR NOR DARK NEITHER TALL NOR SHORT NEITHER TOO GRAVE NOR TOO GAY
HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE SO FROM THE GENERAL ATTENTION EXCITED BY SAINT-AIGNAN'S PREAMBLE AND AROUSED TOO BY MADAME'S PECULIAR MANNER
AS WE HAVE SEEN SAINT-AIGNAN HAD QUITTED THE KING'S APARTMENT AT THE VERY MOMENT THE SUPERINTENDENT ENTERED IT
COVERS THE YEARS 1661-1673
BUT WHAT ABOUT POOR M
LOOK HERE SAID HE MARTINIER JANUARY 1659
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAINT-AIGNAN SAID SPRING
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE COUNT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE CHEVALIER SAID MONSIEUR DO YOU NOT SEE HOW YOU ARE DISTRESSING ME YOUR HIGHNESS'S SIGNATURE SAID GUICHE
THE PRINCESS WHO DID NOT WISH TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF EXPECTING HIM HAD GONE INTO THE GARDENS WITH THE LADIES OF HER SUITE
I INTERCEPTED THEM AND RETURNED THEM TO M
YES YES A BRAVE MAN ONE OF THE CELEBRATED FOUR PRECISELY SO
AND THERE HE HAS DISAPPEARED
INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY ANSWERING MADAME HE EVEN ADVANCED A STEP TOWARDS THE VICOMTE AND HOLDING OUT THE ARM WHICH THE PRINCESS HAD JUST DESIRED HIM TO GIVE HER HE PRESSED HIS FRIEND'S HAND IN HIS OWN WITH A SIGH IN WHICH HE SEEMED TO GIVE TO FRIENDSHIP ALL THE LIFE THAT WAS LEFT IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART
SUDDENLY HIS GLANCE WHICH WAS SMILINGLY DIRECTED TOWARDS MADAME DETECTED THE SLIGHT CORRESPONDENCE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND THE COUNT
MALICORNE ALWAYS BROUGHT TO BLOIS A FASHION A SECRET OR A PERFUME
I CAME HERE ON HORSEBACK DRESSED AS YOU ARE NO MONSIEUR
ETEXT 2681 OUR NEW ETEXT)--CHAPTERS 76-140 OF THAT THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
I HAVE AN EXCELLENT ONE TO MATCH YOURS PARTICULARLY IF YOURS ENDS IN AME DE GUICHE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND RECOGNIZING A FRIEND HE TOOK HIM BY THE ARM
BUT SHE WAS RETURNING TO THEM
THERE LIKEWISE YOU SERVED ME VALIANTLY AH AH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WITHOUT HIS SELF-COMMAND BEING ABLE TO PREVENT A BLUSH FROM MOUNTING TO HIS EYES--"YOU KNOW THAT ALSO SIRE YES I KNOW IT THE KING POSSESSED A PIERCING GLANCE AND AN INFALLIBLE JUDGMENT WHEN IT WAS HIS OBJECT TO READ MEN'S MINDS
HE EVEN HEARD THE KING SAY THESE WORDS TO HIM AH
HER THOUGHTS RECURRED NOW AND THEN TO THE POOR YOUNG NOBLEMAN WHOM SHE HAD RECEIVED AS A MOTHER AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY AS A HARD-HEARTED STEP-MOTHER AND SHE SIGHED AS SHE THOUGHT OF HIM
AND FINALLY BECAUSE--AND THE WORD TOO BURNT LIKE A HOT IRON--BECAUSE IN FACT IT WAS NOTHING BUT A MYSTIFICATION AFTER ALL
MOLIERE COULD NOT HAVE HEARD THIS MAN
WHY THE DEUCE CANNOT THAT KNAVE COLBERT BE AS EASILY SATISFIED AS YOU ARE--AND I SHOULD GIVE MYSELF FAR LESS TROUBLE THAN I DO
NOT THE JEALOUS HUSBAND BUT THE OTHER WELL THEN SINCE YOUR FRIEND MALICORNE IS SUCH AN INVENTIVE GENIUS LET HIM FIND ME A MEANS OF BEING ADORED BY MONSIEUR AND A PRETEXT TO MAKE MY PEACE WITH HIM VERY GOOD
PROVINCIAL DEBAUCHES PETITS-MAITRES OF SIX HUNDRED LIVRES A YEAR SHARED THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS OPULENCE
WHILE ALL THIS WAS GOING ON MADAME WAS RESTING HERSELF AND BRAGELONNE WAS ENGAGED IN WRITING TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
AND ONE WOULD ALMOST BE TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT NOTHING OF ANY INTEREST NOW OCCURS IN THOSE LIQUID REALMS
I COMMIT HIM TO YOUR CARE AS YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES SAID THE DUKE
LET THE SMALL VAN BE PLACED AT M
IT MUST BE SUPPRESSED AH SIRE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S MUSIC WITHOUT ANY DANCING WILL PRODUCE AN EFFECT SO CHILLING AS TO RUIN THE SUCCESS OF THE BALLET BUT COME SINCE OH SIRE THAT IS NOT THE GREATEST MISFORTUNE
LISTEN TO ME
LISTEN TO ME
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE IS A MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME WHY SHOULD SHE NOT BE A MAID OF HONOR AS WELL AS MYSELF INQUIRED MONTALAIS
RETURN TO YOUR ROOM AND LEAVE FONTAINEBLEAU WITHIN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THE BARON WITHDREW BACKWARDS AS OBSEQUIOUSLY AS IF HE WERE TAKING LEAVE OF THE EMPEROR HE WAS READY TO BETRAY
STAY WHERE YOU ARE
AND YOU SAINT-AIGNAN SAINT-AIGNAN MADE A SIGN WHICH WAS INTENDED TO SIGNIFY WELL SIRE YES
BUT WHEN THEY SAY SUCH DELIGHTFUL THINGS IT WOULD BE UNGRACIOUS TO ACCUSE THEM OF BEING TOO TALKATIVE DO THEY TALK SO DELIGHTFULLY THEN INQUIRED THE PRINCESS INDIFFERENTLY
BUT LA VALLIERE DID NOT MOVE
YES INDEED YOU HAVE SELECTED THE VERY WORD AND YOUR MAJESTY DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT A POOR GIRL LIKE MYSELF MIGHT POSSIBLY BE COMPELLED TO SUBMIT TO THE WILL OF OTHERS FORGIVE ME RETURNED THE KING
IT WAS REMARKED THAT THE KING WHO HAD SEEMED MORE THAN SURPRISED AT HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S APPEARANCE WAS MOST FLATTERING IN HIS COMPLIMENTS TO HER
I ON THE CONTRARY MAINTAIN THAT A TITLE IS USELESS TO THE MAN ON WHOM IT IS BESTOWED AND YOU ARE CORRECT SAID BRAGELONNE QUIETLY
IT IS NOT LIKELY YOU WERE RECOGNIZED BY THE KING
ON HIS ARRIVAL HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF APATHY THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN RECEIVED AT THE HARBOR BY THE MESSENGER WHOM HE HAD DIRECTED TO PRECEDE HIM HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE HAD STRENGTH TO ASK HIS WAY
IT WAS ONE OF THE OTHERS WHO MADE SOME VERY FLATTERING SPEECHES ABOUT THE KING
SHE GRIEVED OVER EVERY BLEMISH AND EVERY DEFECT
THE PUNISHMENT SEEMS VERY SEVERE
A LARGE GATEWAY LOOKING OUT UPON A COURTYARD WAS OPEN
AM I STOUT THEN SHE IS SO MELANCHOLY THE GREATER CONTRAST TO MYSELF WHO AM ACCUSED OF BEING TOO LIVELY SHE IS LAME DO YOU REALLY THINK SO NO DOUBT OF IT
SO HAPPY THAT I WISH FOR NOTHING BEYOND WHAT I HAVE
AND ON HIS RETURN FROM ENGLAND THE MARRIAGE SHALL BE CELEBRATED SINCE THEY LOVE EACH OTHER I RECOGNIZE YOUR MAJESTY'S GREAT GENEROSITY OF DISPOSITION IN THAT ACT SO SAINT-AIGNAN WE WILL CEASE TO OCCUPY OURSELVES WITH THESE MATTERS ANY LONGER SAID LOUIS
THE HEAT WAS STIFLING
A LOUD CRY FOLLOWED BY ANGRY REPROACHES IMMEDIATELY RESOUNDED
DURING THIS TIME THE KING WAS TRANQUILLY CONVERSING WITH DE GUICHE AND FOUQUET RATHER PASSIVELY LETTING THEM TALK THAN HIMSELF LISTENING
YOU REQUIRE A GOVERNMENT FULL OF SUSPICION--LIKE THAT OF THE OLD CARDINAL FOR INSTANCE YES
NAMELY A HOUSE AND BEDS
FOR UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF GOODNESS OF DISPOSITION IS THAT IT IS FAR LESS AMUSING THAN WIT OF AN ILL-NATURED CHARACTER
IT IS TRUE THEY WERE TALKING IN TONES SO LOW THAT THE SOUND OF THEIR WORDS COULD HARDLY BE HEARD IN THE VAST APARTMENT
SHE WHO KNOWS THE LOVES OF THE BIRDS AND ALL THEY WISH TO CONVEY BY THEIR SONGS
BUT IN FACT I OBSERVE--I COMPARE BUCKINGHAM WAS A MADMAN MONSEIGNEUR A MADMAN ABOUT WHOM HOWEVER YOU OPENED MY EYES THOROUGHLY NO NO SAID THE CHEVALIER QUICKLY
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO MONSEIGNEUR CONTINUED COLBERT WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST ON SLENDER RESOURCES FOUQUET MADE A GESTURE OF ASSENT
THE SMILING HILLS OF FRANCE APPEARED IN FULL VIEW WITH THEIR NUMEROUS WHITE HOUSES RENDERED MORE CONSPICUOUS BY THE BRIGHT GREEN OF THE TREES OR THE CLEAR BLUE SKY
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY SAID HE TO THE MUSKETEER SOMETHING TO SAY WHICH YOU DO NOT SAY
HIS FEET WERE BURIED IN THE SOFT GRAVEL AND THICK MOSS
BUT I ASK IF YOU LOVE THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE YOUR AFFIANCED HUSBAND GOOD HEAVENS
COLBERT'S PROVINCE M
FOR THESE TWENTY-EIGHT LEAGUES YOU CANNOT ALLOW LESS THAN FOURTEEN HOURS THAT IS AGREED ONE HOUR TO FIND THE COMTE DE GUICHE GO ON AND AN HOUR TO PERSUADE HIM TO WRITE A LETTER TO MONSIEUR JUST SO SIXTEEN HOURS IN ALL YOU RECKON AS WELL AS M
BUT THE VERY MALIGNITY WHICH HE SAW WAS EXCITED AGAINST THESE POOR GIRLS MADE HIM TAKE A SERIOUS RESOLUTION
EVERY EVENING MADAME RETURNED HOME QUITE EXHAUSTED
WELL MONSIEUR CONTINUED RAOUL I WILL TELL YOU WHERE M
DO NOT HOLD ME UP TO THE RIDICULE OF THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE HOW DO YOU MEAN IF HE HEARS YOU RIDICULE ME HE WILL GO BEYOND YOUR HIGHNESS AND WILL SHOW NO PITY ABOUT YOUR PASSION AND THE PRINCESS DO YOU MEAN FOR MERCY'S SAKE MONSEIGNEUR COME COME DE GUICHE CONFESS THAT YOU DID GET A LITTLE SWEET UPON MADAME I WILL NEVER CONFESS SUCH A THING MONSEIGNEUR OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME I SUPPOSE
YES THEY EAT THEM BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THEY TREATED MY GRAIN
ALL ALIGHTED FROM THEIR CARRIAGES AS SOON AS THEY OBSERVED THAT THE QUEEN WAS DOING SO
CROMWELL MENACES THE INSTITUTION OF ROYALTY ITSELF WHILE MARCHING AGAINST CHARLES I AND AT HOME THE FRONDE IS THREATENING TO TEAR FRANCE APART
THE COURTIERS WHO FOLLOWED WERE IN THE VERY HIGHEST SPIRITS
BUT WHAT IS THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REQUEST THAT YOU WILL PREVENT MADAME FROM BEING A COQUETTE AND GUICHE FROM BEING AMIABLE IS THAT ALL
DE WARDES PARTICULARLY ENDEAVORED TO PROVE TO THE CHEVALIER THE VIOLENCE OF MADAME'S AFFECTION FOR BUCKINGHAM AND HE FINISHED HIS LETTER BY DECLARING THAT HE THOUGHT THIS FEELING WAS RETURNED
I HAVE ACCUMULATED IN MY HEART SUCH A MASS OF DESPAIR AND RAGE THAT I TOO LIKE YOURSELF NEED TO REVENGE MYSELF UPON SOME ONE
THE LATTER LEFT THE KING'S CABINET PALLID AND TOTTERING WHILST D'ARTAGNAN TWISTED UP THE ENDS OF HIS MUSTACHE
THE APPLAUSE CONTINUED SO LONG THAT THE COMTE HAD AMPLE LEISURE TO JOIN THE KING
BUT THE EVIL STILL EXISTS
WHENEVER THERE WAS NOTHING AT COURT TO PUT HIM OUT WHEN HE HAD WEARIED HIMSELF WITH HIS EXCURSIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS TIRED OF WRITING LETTERS WHICH HE COULD NEVER FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF DELIVERING TO THE PEOPLE THEY WERE INTENDED FOR HE RETURNED HOME TO HIS COMFORTABLE LITTLE ROOM AND LEANING UPON THE BALCONY WHICH WAS FILLED WITH NASTURTIUMS AND WHITE PINKS FOR WHOM FONTAINEBLEAU SEEMED TO POSSESS NO ATTRACTIONS WITH ALL ITS ILLUMINATIONS AMUSEMENTS AND FETES
TOWARDS EIGHT O'CLOCK THEN THE GUESTS BEGAN TO ARRIVE AT MADAME'S FOR WE HAVE ALREADY INTIMATED THAT IT WAS MADAME WHO RECEIVED THAT EVENING
SHE WHO KNOWS ALL THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE HOLLOWS OF OAKS AND GRASSY DELLS
THE KING CONSEQUENTLY FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE AMUSEMENTS HE HAD PROVIDED WITH WHICH SOME PERSON OR ANOTHER MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND FAULT
FOUQUET WAS TO BE SEEN
MAZARIN DID NOT WISH TO HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF REMOVING THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO HAD SPRUNG FROM THE BARRICADES
HE WAS TOLD THAT NO ONE KNEW
SHE MADE HIM REPEAT THE MESSAGE TWICE OVER FOR THE POOR GIRL ONLY KNEW M
LOOK IN THE MIRROR THERE--IT IS YOURSELF IT IS TRUE I AM SOMEWHAT PALE MARQUISE
WHATEVER THE COMMANDS SHE IMPOSES ON US WE SHALL OBEY THEM SAYING THIS HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS WHO CAST DOWN HER EYES
FORGIVE ME SAID LOUIS IF I INTERRUPT YOUR CONVERSATION
MAY IT NOT BE SPOKEN EXCEPT IN PRIVATE YOU SHALL JUDGE OF THAT YOURSELF VERY WELL DE GUICHE BENT DOWN
BUT MALICORNE SUSTAINED THE ATTACK BRAVELY
THE ROOM AND BOWING WITH RESPECT HE WITHDREW INTO THE APARTMENT AND THE FRANCISCAN WAS ACCORDINGLY CARRIED AT ONCE INTO THE ROOM
IS THAT ALL MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN INQUIRED THE PRINCESS
FOR THE PRESENT MAKE ME OUT A CONTRACT OF SALE PAYMENT TO BE MADE IN FOUR DAYS I ENTREAT YOU TO REFLECT MADAME
THAT IS TO SAY TO THE ALTAR TO WHICH HE WILL LEAD YOU
OF COURSE BY LETTER SAID MANICAMP
THIS UNTOWARD REMARK WAS THE SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL ROUT
BOAT THERE
THEY BEHAVED AS IF THEY WERE NOT ACQUAINTED
IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENED THAT MALICORNE ASKED HIMSELF AS HE THOUGHT MATTERS CAREFULLY OVER IN HIS MIND AND REFLECTED UPON HIS OWN POSITION IN THE INN HOW IT WAS THAT THEY HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME AN INMATE OF THE HOTEL WHEN HE HAD OBSERVED SINCE HIS RESIDENCE THERE ADMISSION REFUSED TO SO MANY
YOUR WISH IS TO INVITE ME TO YOUR FETE MY OWN IS TO BE PRESENT AT IT
PRAY DO NOT LEAVE ME SAID DE GUICHE STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS HER FOR YOU WOULD BE CONTRADICTING THE KIND WORDS YOU HAVE JUST PRONOUNCED
I DO BUT PLACE AN OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF YOUR HASTY ANGER
AND THEREFORE INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE REGIMENT IN OUR FAVOR WE SHALL HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND MEN YES YES
THAT IS TO SAY MALICORNE UPON THE TREE WITH HIS HEAD STRETCHED OUT MONTALAIS UPON THE ROUND OF THE LADDER AND CLINGING TO IT TIGHTLY AND MANICAMP ON THE GROUND WITH HIS FOOT ADVANCED READY TO SET OFF
LE COMTE DE LA FERE CAME TO CONDUCT ME AS FAR AS SAINT-DENIS WHERE THE REMAINS OF KING LOUIS XIII
D'ARTAGNAN AND THAT TOO BEFORE RAOUL WELL SAID DE WARDES WHAT THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY WHAT THEN CERTAINLY IS THERE ANY PROHIBITION AGAINST ATTACKING M
AT THIS MOMENT RAOUL OPPORTUNELY ARRIVED SEEING HOW DE GUICHE WAS PRESSED BY HIS DANGEROUS QUESTIONER TO WHOM HE ADDRESSED A REMARK AND IN THAT WAY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
HIS PRESENCE CANNOT BE DISPENSED WITH
WHENEVER THERE IS A QUESTION OF LAUGHING A LITTLE OR OF AMUSING OURSELVES LA VALLIERE BEGINS TO CRY
BESIDES I HAVE MY HUSBAND TO CONSIDER
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO STATE YOUR CHARGE AGAINST ME IN PRECISE TERMS IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES MOST CERTAINLY IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES
FOR I THINK IT WOULD BE PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO TELL IT AT ALL EVENTS SAID MONTALAIS IF THE FRIEND DOES NOT EXIST THE BREVET DOES AND THAT CUTS SHORT THE QUESTION THEN I CONCEIVE SAID MADAME DE SAINT-REMY WITH THE GRACIOUS SMILE OF THE CAT WHO IS GOING TO SCRATCH WHEN I FOUND MONSIEUR HERE JUST NOW WELL HE BROUGHT YOU THE BREVET EXACTLY MADAME
MY DEAR MANICAMP HE SAID I AM IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM A RHYME WHAT IS IT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR YOU WILL HELP ME TO FIND WHAT I AM IN SEARCH OF CONTINUED THE COMTE
AH SAID MANICAMP THAT EXPLAINS TO ME THEN WHY AND HOW HE HAS REMAINED
NOTHING WHATEVER REPLIED THE COURTIER AS PALE AS DEATH
SHE HAD INTRIGUED A GOOD DEAL IN HER LIFE
FOR INNOCENT AS SHE WILL BE OF YOUR AFFECTION YOUR AFFECTION WILL BE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HER IN THE HANDS OF HER ENEMIES ALAS MURMURED DE GUICHE
AND SINCE YOU WISHED TO REGARD THE STORM AS A WARNING DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IT BODES MISFORTUNE THE YOUNG GIRL LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT WHILE THEY HAD BEEN TALKING THE RAIN HAD PENETRATED THE FOLIAGE ABOVE THEM AND WAS TRICKLING DOWN THE KING'S FACE
LOUISE RAISED HER HEAD HASTILY AS IF THE QUESTION HAD BEEN INSPIRED BY SOME SUSPICION AND HAD AROUSED A FEELING OF REMORSE
SO IT'S THAT WORTHY FELLOW FROM ORLEANS WHOM YOU PROMISED AN APPOINTMENT IN MONSIEUR'S HOUSEHOLD
YOUR HIGHNESS HAS SOMETIMES CONFERRED THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR UPON ME OF CALLING ME YOUR FRIEND YES YES
BUCKINGHAM FEELING HIS RIGHT ARM PARALYZED STRETCHED OUT HIS LEFT SEIZED HIS SWORD WHICH WAS ABOUT FALLING FROM HIS NERVELESS GRASP AND BEFORE DE WARDES COULD RESUME HIS GUARD HE THRUST HIM THROUGH THE BREAST
HE WAS HORRIFIED AT THE EXPENSES WHICH MYTHOLOGY INVOLVED
THAT CLASS OF PEOPLE CALL DOWN BLESSINGS UPON ME AND ARE SORRY TO LEAVE THE PRISON
AH!"--AND THIS MONOSYLLABLE INDICATED AS MUCH ANGER AS THE YOUNG MAN MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED GRATITUDE
LET OTHERS ACT THE PART OF A JEALOUS HUSBAND NOT I
NOT ONLY WAS THE YOUNG QUEEN WEEPING BUT SHE WAS COMPLAINING ALSO
BUT I AWAITED WITH RESIGNATION THE DAY WHEN THE TRUTH WOULD PREVAIL
BUT AT A SIGN WHICH DISPLAYED NO LITTLE AMOUNT OF ANNOYANCE MANICAMP AND DE GUICHE LEFT THE ROOM SO THAT MADAME LEFT ALONE BEGAN SADLY TO PICK UP HER PEARLS AND AMETHYSTS NO LONGER SMILING AND SPEAKING STILL LESS
THE LATTER ON HIS SIDE WAS ANIMATED WITH THE WILDEST GAYETY
WHEN IN HIS ROOM MONSIEUR BEGAN TO DRESS FOR THE NIGHT WITH CAREFUL ATTENTION WHICH DISPLAYED ITSELF FROM TIME TO TIME IN PAROXYSMS OF SATISFACTION
LOOK AT ME ATTENTIVELY AND TRY TO RECOLLECT MADAME
SHE WAS SITTING THOUGHTFULLY ALMOST SAD
AND SHE BEGAN BY HEAVING A DEEP SIGH AND SAYING:--"WHAT HAPPINESS TO BE HERE ALONE AND AT LIBERTY WITH EVERY RIGHT TO BE FRANK ESPECIALLY TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER YES SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
THE NEIGHING OF THE HORSES AND THE CRUNCHING OF THE WHEELS ON THE GRAVEL OF THE COURTYARD COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD
I CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE GENTLEMEN INTEND TO EXPOSE THE LIVES OF THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES REPLIED THE ADMIRAL
UNDAUNTED OUR HEROES RETURN TO FRANCE JUST IN TIME TO HELP SAVE THE YOUNG LOUIS XIV QUIET THE FRONDE AND TWEAK THE NOSE OF CARDINAL MAZARIN
BE KIND ENOUGH SAID THE FRANCISCAN TO HIM TO SEND THESE EXCELLENT FELLOWS AWAY
SHE DIVERTS HERSELF WITH THE FEELING AS CHILDREN DO WITH FIREWORKS FORM WHICH A SPARK MIGHT SET A PALACE ON FIRE
HE HAD THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP NEAR MADAME DURING THE PASSAGE TO THE SHORE AND BY THIS MEANS TO ENJOY TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT THE BRIEF PERIOD FORTUNE STILL RESERVED FOR HIM
ON THE CONTRARY I DID NOT DRAG YOU OUT OF THE CHATEAU
IT FURTHER RESULTS CONTINUED THE SPEAKER THAT THE MAN WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO FORESEE EVENTS AND TO RENDER CERTAIN THAT WHICH IS NO MORE THAN A VAGUE IDEA FLOATING IN THE MIND OF MAN THAT IS TO SAY THE IDEA OF A FUTURE GOOD OR EVIL WOULD PRESERVE THE WORLD FROM A GREAT CATASTROPHE
MADAME UPON THE EARTH HOW MANY TALES ARE THERE FULL OF WELL SAID MADAME AND WHAT IS TAKING PLACE UPON THE EARTH THAT QUESTION MUST BE ASKED OF THE DRYADS REPLIED THE COMTE
MADAME HAD SIGHED FIRST CLOSING HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES NEXT OPENING THEM AND THEN LADEN AS THEY WERE WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE MOURNFULNESS OF EXPRESSION SHE HAD RAISED THEM TOWARDS THE KING WHOSE FACE AT THAT MOMENT VISIBLY HEIGHTENED IN COLOR
THIS JOKE IS A MOST AMUSING ONE FOR I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM NEVER SAID MARGUERITE RESTRAINING HER LAUGHTER
NO BOOKS AT ANY TIME
LOUIS AGAIN LOOKED ROUND HIM WITH GREATER ATTENTION THAN BEFORE AND PERCEIVING AN ENORMOUS OAK WITH WIDE-SPREADING BRANCHES HE HURRIEDLY DREW LA VALLIERE BENEATH ITS PROTECTING SHELTER
BUT WE CAN HARDLY REACH IT NOW WITHOUT GETTING OUR FEET WET YES
THE LANDLORD TOOK THE TWO LOUIS OUT OF THE MONK'S HAND AND PLACED THEM IN THAT OF ONE OF THE PEASANTS ALL FOUR OF WHOM WITHDREW OPENING THEIR EYES WIDER THAN EVER
THE APPEARANCE OF THE ROOM AT THAT MOMENT WAS AS FOLLOWS:--IN THE CENTER BEFORE THE FIREPLACE WHICH WAS FILLED WITH FLOWERS MADAME WAS STANDING UP WITH HER MAIDS OF HONOR FORMED IN TWO WINGS ON EITHER SIDE OF HER
HE IMPROVES ON CLOSE ACQUAINTANCE
MY FRIEND MANICAMP DOES NOTHING FOR NOTHING CHAPTER IV
SIT DOWN ON THE BANK WHERE YOU WERE WHERE LA VALLIERE WAS AND SPEAK IN THE SAME TONE AND TO THE SAME EFFECT AS YOU DID BEFORE
WHY IT IS THESE PERSONS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE WHO ON SUCH OCCASIONS HAVE ALL THE INFLUENCE
IN ONE WORD TO CONVERT THE ROYAL DIVINITY INTO A MERE MORTAL BY STRIKING AT HIS HEART OR RATHER EVEN AT HIS FACE LIKE THE MEANEST OF HIS SUBJECTS WAS TO INFLICT A TERRIBLE BLOW UPON THE PRIDE OF THAT GENEROUS NATURE
THE SECRETARY AND STEWARD LEAPED INTO THE SEA AND APPROACHED THE MARQUIS WHO NO LONGER SHOWED ANY SIGN OF LIFE
WHAT INCOME DOES VANNES BRING YOU IN CONTINUED THE KING
THIS GLOOMY GENTLENESS OF MANNER THIS SMILING SADNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH HAD REPLACED HIS FORMER EXCESSIVE JOY PRODUCED AN INDESCRIBABLE EFFECT UPON MADAME DE BELLIERE WHO WAS REGARDING HIM AT A DISTANCE
BRAGELONNE WAS A VERY MODEL OF ELEGANCE IN EVERY WAY
WHO WAS IT THAT SHIELDED BEHIND HIS ROYAL AUTHORITY HAD SAID TO THIS YOUNG CREATURE
THAT THE PROMENADE WAS ARRANGED AND THAT WHATEVER THE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE PROMENADE SHOULD TAKE PLACE
BUT I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THEY ARE ALL LAUGHING AT IT REPLIED THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE AND MONSIEUR HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF THEM YET HAZARDED DE GUICHE I HAVE HEARD THAT THE KING PAID MADAME A VISIT YES PRECISELY SO
FROM THAT MOMENT SHE WAS FIRM IN HER OWN STRENGTH AND SHE FELT THAT SHE LOVED FOUQUET BEYOND EVERYTHING ELSE
THE DAY AFTER HE HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN HIS ROOM HE HAD NOTICED THE SEVEN TRAVELERS ARRIVE SUCCESSIVELY WHO SPEEDILY FILLED THE WHOLE HOTEL
AND HE ON HIS SIDE NO LESS DESERVES FAVOR SUCH AS I WISH TO CONFER UPON HIM
GRISART GRISART GIVE ME TO LIVE A SINGLE HOUR LONGER GRISART APPROACHED THE DYING MONK AND MADE HIM SWALLOW A FEW DROPS NOT OF THE POTION WHICH WAS STILL LEFT IN THE GLASS BUT OF THE CONTENTS OF A SMALL BOTTLE HE HAD UPON HIS PERSON
WELL I ASKED FOR THE APPOINTMENTS FOR YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT I HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR THAT DROLL FELLOW MANICAMP AND YOU OBTAINED WHAT YOU SOUGHT FOR MONTALAIS YES
WOULD THAT VOLATILE MIND THAT INCONSTANT HEART BE LIKELY TO BE FIXED FOR A MOMENT EVEN WERE IT TO GAZE UPON AN ANGEL
AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT AS FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED SHE PROMISED TO TELL AS MANY FALSEHOODS AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
YET MONSIEUR IT IS NOT MONSIEUR BUT HOW CAN IT BE THAT A PRINCE NOT OF THE ROYAL LINE THAT A PRINCE WITHOUT ANY RIGHT MY KING OR RATHER YOUR KING WILL BE EVERYTHING THAT IS NECESSARY BE ASSURED OF THAT BE CAREFUL MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY YOU MAKE MY BLOOD RUN COLD AND MY HEAD SWIM ARAMIS SMILED
I BEGGED YOU TO WAIT THE OPPORTUNITY OF FORMING AN ILLUSTRIOUS ALLIANCE
MALICORNE WHO OBTAINED IT FOR ME RAOUL REMAINED FOR A MOMENT ALMOST STUPEFIED ASKING HIMSELF IF THEY WERE TRIFLING WITH HIM
YES SAID SAINT-AIGNAN UNDER THE ROYAL OAK WITH MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT INQUIRED MONTALAIS
HAVE YOU ANY I BELIEVE SO THEN DON'T MAKE YOURSELF UNEASY IT IS DECIDED THEN THAT AT THE LAST MOMENT YOU WILL COME TO MY ASSISTANCE IT WILL ONLY BE THE REPAYMENT OF A DEBT I OWE YOU IT IS THE VOCATION OF FINANCIERS TO ANTICIPATE THE WANTS OF MEN SUCH AS YOURSELF D'HERBLAY IF OBLIGINGNESS IS THE VOCATION OF FINANCIERS CHARITY IS THE VIRTUE OF THE CLERGY
COME M
ONLY SHE SET TO WORK IN A DIFFERENT MANNER BY ATTACKING THEM IN THE FOLLOWING WAY:--TO HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW SHE SAID SEE NOW THERESE HOW VERY WRONG YOU WERE TO ACCUSE THE KING
IN HONEST TRUTH I SAY SO THANK YOU MY LORD
THE OPPORTUNITY WAS EXPECTED TO BE THE CONCESSION OF A GOOD POST IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF MONSIEUR WHEN THAT HOUSEHOLD WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AT THE PERIOD OF HIS MARRIAGE
TO MAKE YOU ENTER INTO SUCH A BARGAIN LISTEN
IN LOOKING WHETHER THE BIT SUITED HIS MOUTH I SAW THAT HE WAS RISING SEVEN THE VERY AGE WHEN THE TRAINING OF A HORSE INTENDED FOR A CHARGER SHOULD COMMENCE
A FEW IDLERS AND FIVE OR SIX FISHERMEN HAD GATHERED ON THE SHORE ATTRACTED BY THE STRANGE SPECTACLE OF TWO MEN FIGHTING WITH THE WATER UP TO THEIR KNEES
BUT THE TRUTH IS I HAVE A JUST RIGHT TO BEG YOU TO CONFIDE IN ME FROM TIME TO TIME ANY FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BEFALL YOU IN WHICH I SHOULD REJOICE YOU KNOW MORE THAN IF THEY HAD BEFALLEN MYSELF MY DEAR PRELATE SAID FOUQUET LAUGHING MY SECRETS ARE OF TOO PROFANE A CHARACTER TO CONFIDE THEM TO A BISHOP HOWEVER GREAT A WORLDLING HE MAY BE BAH
I SHOULD NOT BE ASTONISHED IF HE WERE FOR HE SEEMS TO BE ON VERY GOOD TERMS WITH THE DRYADS OF FONTAINEBLEAU NEVER MIND SAID FOUQUET
SO THAT SHE WAS PARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY HIM
ETEXT 1259--SECOND BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
BUT IT IS FROM OVERWORK
BUT AS HE DID NOT SPEAK OF HER SHE SAID AND THE POOR GIRL WHAT POOR GIRL SAID THE KING
STRENGTH COMES WITH BATTLE
MALICORNE ARRIVED JUST IN TIME FOR THE COMTE DE GUICHE WAS ON THE POINT OF TAKING LEAVE OF MONSIEUR BEFORE SETTING OUT FOR LE HAVRE WHERE THE PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH NOBILITY HAD GONE TO AWAIT MADAME'S ARRIVAL FROM ENGLAND
MADAME SAID FOUQUET WHOSE FACE WAS FOR A MOMENT LIGHTED UP BY A SUDDEN GLEAM OF JOY YOU ARE INDEED AN ANGEL AND NO MAN CAN SUSPECT YOU
YOU MIGHT NOW SHOW HIM THE SOURCE WHENCE HE COULD OBTAIN THE MILLIONS WHICH THE KING ASKED HIM FOR YESTERDAY MILLIONS SAID THE MARQUISE IN TERROR
THE SOLE DEPOSITARY OF TWO SECRETS HE DID NOT DESPAIR OF CONCLUDING SOME ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES
ENRICHED BY DEGREES BY THESE PRESENTS AND TRANSFERS OF PROPERTY SHE TOOK A FANCY TO INHERITANCES BY ANTICIPATION
I PUT A QUESTION TO YOU SO ANSWER IT YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT SAID LOUISE IN A CHOKING VOICE SPEAK TO ME LIKE A FRIEND
RAOUL WILL HAVE THE HONOR OF PRESENTING HIMSELF BEFORE YOUR MAJESTY TO RECEIVE YOUR CONSENT YOU ARE MISTAKEN COMTE SAID THE KING FIRMLY
HE OWES HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THAT AT LEAST BUT WE MUST SEE DE GUICHE THEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THAT
I LOVE YOU STILL SIRE
MALICORNE HURRIED FORWARD AND RECEIVED IT TREMBLING WITH DELIGHT
BUT IN ORDER TO BE PERFECTLY REASSURED ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM OCCUPY HIMSELF WITH SOME ONE ELSE AH
DE GUICHE OH AS FOR HIM HE IS COMPLETELY TURNED OFF HAVE THEY BEEN WRITING TO EACH OTHER NO CERTAINLY NOT
OUR APARTMENTS I SEE ARE PREPARED IN FACT IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL DE VILLE UPON THE WIDE OPEN SPACE BEFORE IT EIGHT TENTS HAD BEEN RAISED SURMOUNTED BY THE FLAGS OF FRANCE AND ENGLAND UNITED
I WILL ASK YOU THEREFORE TO INFORM ME IF THE KING IS IN THE CHATEAU OR NOT IF I AM LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SEE HIM THIS EVENING OR IF I SHALL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TO-MORROW WE HAVE LOST SIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY DURING THE LAST HALF-HOUR NEARLY SAID THE CHEVALIER
DE GUICHE AND M
IN MY DISTRESS I CONFIDED IN M
AS FOR ARAMIS HE ON HIS SIDE WAS ENGAGED IN READING BUT WITH MORE COOLNESS AND REFLECTION THE FOLLOWING LETTER
LE HAVRE
THE SOLDIERS HAVE PLENTY OF WINE EXCELLENT PROVISIONS AND GOOD PAY VERY GOOD
THIS WAS THE WISEST THING TO DO BUT UNHAPPILY TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE TWO THINGS WERE WANTING
RAOUL WHO HAD BEGUN HIS ADDRESS WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF SELF-POSSESSION FINISHED IT BY ALLOWING A MANIFEST EMOTION TO ESCAPE HIM AT EVERY WORD
I AM YOUR FRIEND
THE PRINCESS'S EDUCATION MAY HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED BUT HER PRINCIPLES I BELIEVE ARE GOOD
FOUQUET SO NOTORIOUS FOR HIS GENEROSITY HIS GALLANTRY AND HIS SENSITIVE DELICACY OF FEELING WITH REGARD TO WOMEN GENERALLY HAD RECEIVED MORE INVITATIONS THAN HE HAD REQUESTED AUDIENCES
THE KING ONLY RECOVERED HIS ATTENTION IN SOME DEGREE AT THE MOMENT THAT MONSIEUR COLBERT WHO HAD BEEN NARROWLY OBSERVANT FOR SOME MINUTES APPROACHED AND DOUBTLESS WITH GREAT RESPECT YET WITH MUCH PERSEVERANCE WHISPERED A COUNSEL OF SOME SORT INTO THE STILL TINGLING EARS OF THE KING
BUT THE PROMISE OF NOMINATION WITHOUT THE POST ITSELF IS LIKE A PURSE WITH NO MONEY IN IT QUITE TRUE MANICAMP REPLIED A SECOND TIME
TO THE CONVERSATIONS BENEATH THE SHADE OF THE TREES,--TO REMARKS MADE IN THE SHAPE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS MYSTERIOUSLY EXCHANGED SUCCEEDED THE NOISIEST BURSTS OF LAUGHTER;--FROM THE VERY OUTRIDERS TO ROYALTY ITSELF MERRIMENT SEEMED TO SPREAD
ARAMIS REITERATED THE EXPRESSION OF HIS WISH TO SEE THE GOVERNOR
AND I ASK ONLY HALF AN HOUR TO PROVE TO YOU THAT THE LETTER IS IN MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S HAND OR TO BRING YOU BACK THE LETTER ITSELF ARAMIS LOOKED AT THE VALET SCRUTINIZINGLY
THE JEWELER THOUGH A MILLIONAIRE WAS A MODEST MAN
RAOUL CONCEALED IN THE SHADOW DIVINED THE MANY PASSIONATE THOUGHTS THAT ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TENT OF THE YOUNG AMBASSADOR AND THE BALCONY OF THE PRINCESS A MYSTERIOUS AND MAGICAL BOND OF SYMPATHY--A BOND CREATED BY THOUGHTS IMPRINTED WITH SO MUCH STRENGTH AND PERSISTENCE OF WILL THAT THEY MUST HAVE CAUSED HAPPY AND LOVING DREAMS TO ALIGHT UPON THE PERFUMED COUCH WHICH THE COUNT WITH THE EYES OF HIS SOUL DEVOURED SO EAGERLY
HOW FORTUNATELY HER FAINTING FIT CAME ON SINCE YOUR MAJESTY HAD ALREADY OCCUPIED YOURSELF ABOUT HER WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR FAIR LADY SAINT-AIGNAN
ARE YOU ALONE HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
AND FOR NO PURPOSE SAID DE WARDES FOR WITH THE WIND IN YOUR TEETH AS IT WILL BE YOU WILL NEVER REACH THE VESSELS YOU REFUSE THEN ASSUREDLY I DO
WITH THIS SOLE DIFFERENCE HOWEVER THAT THE CRUEL SHEPHERDESS HAVING STOLEN THE QUIVER OF YOUNG LOVE WHILE POOR CUPID WAS SLEEPING IN A THICKET OF ROSES INSTEAD OF DIRECTING HER ARROWS AGAINST THE INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST DISCHARGES THEM PITILESSLY AGAINST ALL POOR SHEPHERDS WHO PASS WITHIN REACH OF HER BOW AND OF HER EYES OH
THE DEVOTION OF A MAN OF HONOR SHOULD AMBITION OF ANY KIND INSPIRE YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY SERVE AS A MEANS OF DISPLAY FOR YOUR TALENT AND BEAUTY
YOU WILL DINE WITH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU THERE WITH ME OH
IT WAS TONNAY-CHARENTE TO WHOM MADAME HAD MADE A SIGN TO APPROACH
IS THE COMTE DE LA FERE AT HAND HE IS BELOW AND AWAITS YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION LET HIM COME UP AT ONCE SAID THE KING AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS ATHOS ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF LOUIS XIV
BUT AS MALICORNE SAW A GREAT ADVANTAGE IN THE PROPOSITION WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM HE GAVE MONTALAIS A SIGN OF ASSENT WHICH SHE RETURNED
AND YOU COMTE ARE RATHER PARTICULAR I BELIEVE ABOUT YOUR OWN FAMILY SIRE I NO LONGER HOLD TO ANYTHING BUT MY DEVOTION TO YOUR MAJESTY THE KING AGAIN PAUSED
MALICORNE WAS THEN ABLE TO APPROACH MONTALAIS VERY QUIETLY AND UNDER COVER OF THE GENERAL DIN OF CONVERSATION SAID TO HER
THESE BARRACKS OBSTRUCT MY SIGHT
AH SAID THE KING WHAT WAS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
BY THE BY WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU BRAGELONNE AND DE WARDES BOTH EXCELLENT AND FEARLESS COMPANIONS TOO FEARLESS SAID THE CHEVALIER
IT IS FRIGHTFUL SAID SHE THAT ONE CAN NEVER GUESS WHETHER YOU ARE SPEAKING SERIOUSLY OR NOT I CANNOT SPEAK MORE SERIOUSLY
MARTINIER MARCH 1661
LOUISE POSSESSES EVERY VIRTUE AND HAS NOT A SINGLE FAULT AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN PASSED ON AND AS THEY PROCEEDED THEIR VOICES WERE SOON LOST IN THE DISTANCE
SO QUARRELSOME A DISPOSITION IS HARDLY BECOMING AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE EDICTS AGAINST DUELS
AND THAT SOME CONJUGAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MATERNAL SCOLDINGS WERE THE CONSEQUENCE HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT I DO KNOW IT
THE CHEVALIER HAD NOT TAKEN HIS EYES OFF HIM
WHEREAS IN MADAME'S CASE A LONG WHITE VEIL ENVELOPED HER WRAPPING HER ROUND AND ROUND A HUNDRED TIMES AS SHE RESIGNED HERSELF INTO THE HANDS OF HER FEMALE ATTENDANTS AND THUS WAS RENDERED INACCESSIBLE TO THE MOST INDISCREET AS WELL AS TO THE MOST PENETRATING GAZE
IN OTHER WORDS WHERE IT MIGHT FIX ITS BITE
SHE IS RATHER THIN BUT HAS FASCINATIONS WITHOUT NUMBER MADEMOISELLE DE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE SAID MADAME DE NAVAILLES
MY HOUSE IS THE PLEASANTEST IN THE KINGDOM THEN TURNING TOWARDS DE GUICHE COMTE HE SAID I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE SO GOOD A DANCER AND AGAIN ADDRESSING HIS WIFE HE SAID SHOW A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION FOR ME MADAME
THAT IS IT POOR FELLOW
MADAME STOPPED
PHILIP
IF THEREFORE HE SO NOTORIOUSLY FAILED IN THIS REGARD THERE MUST BE A SERIOUS CAUSE FOR IT
YOUR DISCHARGE WITHOUT DOUBT I AM TOO PROUD TO EAT THE BREAD OF THE KING WITHOUT EARNING IT OR RATHER BY GAINING IT BADLY.--MY DISCHARGE SIRE OH OH I ASK FOR MY DISCHARGE OR I WILL TAKE IT YOU ARE ANGRY MONSIEUR I HAVE REASON MORDIOUX THIRTY-TWO HOURS IN THE SADDLE I RIDE DAY AND NIGHT I PERFORM PRODIGIES OF SPEED I ARRIVE STIFF AS THE CORPSE OF A MAN WHO HAS BEEN HUNG--AND ANOTHER ARRIVES BEFORE ME
I AM OF SO LITTLE IMPORTANCE OH
FOR I VERILY BELIEVE HE IS EVEN MORE ENVIOUS THAN I
AND YOU LA VALLIERE ASKED MADAME
BUT I MUST MOUNT IT BEFORE I GIVE YOU MY OPINION DO SO M
INSTEAD OF FIXING YOUR MIND ON THIS DEPARTURE DOES NOT YOUR IMAGINATION--OR RATHER DOES NOT YOUR HEART--SUGGEST SOME EXPEDIENT WHAT IS IT YOU WISH MY HEART TO SUGGEST TELL ME HOW CAN ONE PROVE TO ANOTHER THAT IT IS WRONG TO BE JEALOUS IN THE FIRST PLACE SIRE BY GIVING NO MOTIVE FOR JEALOUSY
IN THE SAME MANNER YOU CAN READ IN MY PRESENT STEP TOWARDS YOU THAT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU OH
DE BRAGELONNE WHO IS AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN AND AN ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH FOR A GIRL WITHOUT FORTUNE
AND EVERYBODY TOOK IT FOR A TOKEN OF ASSENT
WELL AND I SHALL TELL IT YOU DO NOT BE IN A HURRY GUICHE EXCLAIMED THE PRINCE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
A PROPERLY REGULATED WOMAN ENDOWED WITH A NATURAL HEART OUGHT TO LOOK AT MEN MAKE HERSELF LOVED--ADORED EVEN BY THEM AND SAY AT THE VERY UTMOST BUT ONCE IN HER LIFE I BEGIN TO THINK THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN WHAT I AM,--I SHOULD HAVE DETESTED THIS ONE LESS THAN OTHERS THEREFORE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE THAT IS WHAT M
DE GUICHE AM GLAD OF THIS ACCIDENTAL MEETING SAID THE YOUNG GIRL AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW
HE WOULD SEE THAT WE ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HIS ANSWER
YOUR LADYSHIP IS EXTREMELY METHODICAL I AM AWARE LET US NOW TURN TO ANOTHER SUBJECT SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE
YOU CANNOT REPENT OF HAVING DRAWN YOUR SWORD FOR ME WELL IN THAT YOUR MAJESTY IS DECEIVED AND GREATLY
AND YOU HAVE BEEN WRONGLY INFORMED M
BESIDES WE SHALL NOT HAVE LONG TO WAIT
HE TOOK HIS LEAVE OF THE KING IN THE SIMPLE UNPRETENDING LANGUAGE OF A COUNTRY PASTOR AND DISAPPEARED
D'HERBLAY MAY NOT POSSIBLY BE SO FAR AWAY AS YOU FEAR PRAY TELL ME HIS ADDRESS I REALLY DON'T KNOW IT IN THAT CASE I AM LOST
THANK YOU FOR YOUR READINESS GENTLEMEN SAID ATHOS
MADAME WHO IN HER PRIDE HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT IT WAS TO WAIT NOW WAITED UNTIL THIS MUTE COLLOQUY WAS AT AN END
AND SAINT-AIGNAN HIS HEART BRIMFUL OF HAPPINESS HASTILY WITHDREW TELLING THE USHER TO INTRODUCE M
THEY COUGHED DREW CLOSER TOGETHER LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT SOME OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR WHO IN ORDER TO SUPPORT WITH GREATER PROPRIETY OR WITH MORE STEADINESS THE FIXITY OF THE INQUISITORIAL LOOKS BENT UPON THEM ADJUSTED THEIR FANS ACCORDINGLY AND ASSUMED THE BEARING OF A DUELIST ABOUT TO BE EXPOSED TO HIS ADVERSARY'S FIRE
WELL I SUPPOSE WE SHALL LEARN SOME DAY OR ANOTHER CHAPTER XXII
NAMELY FOR AN ORDINARY JUDGE AND FOR AN ECCLESIASTIC AND YOU HAVE SEVEN YOU SAY
TELL US WHY THE KING THE KING EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE
FOUQUET AND MAKE HER ESCAPE HAPPIER THAN IF INSTEAD OF HAVING GIVEN A MILLION SHE HAD HERSELF FOUND ONE
MADAME HE SAID WHAT YOU OFFER IS IMPOSSIBLE AND I CANNOT ACCEPT SUCH CONDITIONS WHAT SAID MADAME DO YOU REFUSE MY FRIENDSHIP THEN NO NO
THERE ARE THE KEYS DO YOU DO IT I WILL SOLICIT THE PARDON OF THAT POOR BOY SAID ARAMIS
BUT AT LEAST I CAN WITHDRAW AND I SHALL DO SO JEALOUS OF THE KING--JEALOUS OF YOUR BROTHER YES MADAME I AM JEALOUS OF THE KING--OF MY OWN BROTHER AND REMARKABLY JEALOUS TOO REALLY MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED ANNE OF AUSTRIA AFFECTING TO BE INDIGNANT I BEGIN TO BELIEVE YOU ARE MAD AND A SWORN ENEMY TO MY REPOSE
I ORDER YOU TO DO SO SAID THE KING ADVANCING FROM THE OBSCURITY AND PARTIALLY OPENING HIS CLOAK
DE GUICHE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE SOVEREIGN PRINCE OF THE WHOLE LAUGHTER-LOVING COURT
HEAVEN FORGIVE ME IF SHE IS NOT WEARING THE VERY SAME PETTICOAT THIS EVENING THAT SHE HAD ON THIS MORNING DURING THE PROMENADE AND WHICH SHE MANAGED TO KEEP CLEAN THANKS TO THE CARE THE KING TOOK OF HER IN SHELTERING HER FROM THE RAIN AT THE VERY MOMENT MADAME UTTERED THESE WORDS THE KING ENTERED THE ROOM
THESE THIRTY THOUSAND CROWNS HAD BECOME VERY FRUITFUL DURING TWENTY YEARS
I BEG I IMPLORE YOU
AT SIGHT OF THE PRINCE THE YOUNG QUEEN ROSE PRECIPITATELY AND DRIED HER TEARS
I AM AT PARIS IN THAT CASE I SHALL RETURN TO BLOIS
BELLE-ISLE IS PAID FOR
WHAT IS THE MATTER MONSIEUR LE COMTE INQUIRED LA VALLIERE WITH SOME ANXIETY
AS DE GUICHE QUITTED THE THEATER FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING INTO THE FRESH AIR HE SO MUCH NEEDED HE PASSED CLOSE TO THIS FIGURE AND SALUTED HER
AND AS I MADE HIM TURN ROUND AND CHANGE HIS FEET I FOUND HIM QUICK AND READY IN DOING SO WELL SAID M
FOR ARE YOU NOT HIS SISTER FOR WHOM HE HAS A GREAT REGARD
THERE WERE CERTAIN DAYS WHEN MADAME REMEMBERED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN YOUNG AND ON THOSE DAYS WHOEVER TALKED WITH HER FOUND IN HER A SINCERE FRIEND
SHE WAS WEEPING AND COMPLAINING TO MY MOTHER AND WAS REPROACHING US FOR THOSE BATHING PARTIES WHICH HAVE MADE ME SO HAPPY AND ME TOO ANSWERED MADAME BY A LOOK
BESIDES THE DE WHICH HAD BEEN PREFIXED TO HIS NAME RAISED HIM TO THE RANK OF THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE WAS CONVERSING
CONSIDERING THE STRICT RULES OF ETIQUETTE ESTABLISHED AT THE COURT OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA THIS FORGETFULNESS OF CUSTOMARY CIVILITIES WAS A SIGN OF PREOCCUPATION ESPECIALLY ON PHILIP'S PART WHO OF HIS OWN ACCORD OBSERVED A RESPECT TOWARDS HER OF A SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED CHARACTER
WAS I RIGHT WELL MY DEAR GOVERNOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO YIELD TO EVIDENCE
THE SAME SONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT DOES NOT THE RESEMBLANCE YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT JUST NOW STRIKE THE TURNKEYS MY DEAR M
LE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD HAD AS THE COMPANION OF HIS BOYHOOD THIS DE MANICAMP A POOR GENTLEMAN VASSAL-BORN OF THE HOUSE OF GRAMONT
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THE STUPEFACTION OF THE KING AND THAT OF MONSIEUR WHO WAS MOVING ABOUT RESTLESSLY IN HIS BOX,--TO DESCRIBE ALSO THE AGITATED MOVEMENT OF THE HEADS IN THE THEATER AND THE STRANGE EMOTION OF MADAME AT THE SIGHT OF HER PARTNER,--IS A TASK WE MUST LEAVE TO ABLER HANDS
THE STORY WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE AMUSED ME AND SO I REMEMBERED IT AND TOLD IT TO YOU
THEREFORE QUESTION HIM YOURSELF
DURING THIS DISCUSSION THE NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN AND THE TORCHES PAGES ATTENDANTS SQUIRES HORSES AND CARRIAGES BLOCKED UP THE GATE AND THE OPEN PLACE
THE DOME OF CLOUDS WAS TINGED AT ITS BASE WITH AS IT WERE THE FOAM OF RUBIES FADING AWAY INTO OPAL AND PEARLY TINTS IN PROPORTION AS THE GAZE WAS CARRIED FROM BASE TO SUMMIT
BESIDES CONTINUED THE QUEEN THE INJURY IS NEITHER TRUE NOR POSSIBLE AND IT IS MERELY A MATTER OF SILLY JEALOUSY MADAME I KNOW WHAT I KNOW WHATEVER YOU MAY KNOW I CAN ONLY ADVISE YOU TO BE PATIENT I AM NOT PATIENT BY DISPOSITION MADAME THE QUEEN ROSE FULL OF SEVERITY AND WITH AN ICY CEREMONIOUS MANNER
FOUQUET'S HONOR
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE BLUSHES OF THOSE INTERCHANGED SIGHS AND OF THIS ROYAL AGITATION WAS THAT MONTALAIS HAD COMMITTED AN INDISCRETION WHICH HAD CERTAINLY AFFECTED HER COMPANION FOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE LESS CLEAR SIGHTED PERHAPS TURNED PALE WHEN THE KING BLUSHED
THE WITHERS ARE RATHER LOW
ATTACKED I INSTINCTIVELY REPEL THE ATTACK NOTHING MORE COME TELL ME WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU SAID THE KING
WHILE ON THE CONTRARY THE PRINCE OR THE KING OR THE EMPEROR WHICHEVER YOU PLEASE WAS PLAINLY IN LOVE WITH SOME ONE ELSE AND--A SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE ONE INDEED WHICH SHE COULD NOT PERCEIVE ALTHOUGH EVERY ONE AROUND AND ABOUT HER PERCEIVED IT CLEARLY ENOUGH MADE USE OF HER AS A SCREEN FOR HIS OWN LOVE AFFAIR
MALICORNE A PLACE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD MONSEIGNEUR WHAT KIND OF A PLACE ANY KIND OF A PLACE
ARAMIS LOOKED UP
AND YET LET US HASTEN TO ADD THAT SUCH A STYLE OF WIT COULD NOT BE ASSIGNED TO MADAME FOR HER DISPOSITION OF MIND NATURALLY OF THE VERY HIGHEST ORDER COMPRISED TOO MUCH TRUE GENEROSITY TOO MANY NOBLE IMPULSES AND HIGH-SOULED THOUGHTS TO WARRANT HER BEING TERMED ILL-NATURED
AS SHE READ HER FACE BRIGHTENED
I TELL YOU VICOMTE I TELL YOU I LOVE HER MADLY
AND I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I TRANSACT THEM WITHOUT INTERFERENCE THEN I PERCEIVE SAID COLBERT TREMBLING WITH ANGER AND FEAR THAT I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FALL INTO DISGRACE WITH YOUR MAJESTY NOT AT ALL
PROBABLY THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF MANICAMP WHO WAS DRESSED VERY PLAINLY DID NOT INSPIRE HIM WITH MUCH RESPECT FOR HE REPLIED DISDAINFULLY WHO MAY YOU BE MONSIEUR MANICAMP LEANING ON THE ARM OF A GIGANTIC TROOPER AS FIRM AS THE PILLAR OF A CATHEDRAL REPLIED IN HIS USUAL TRANQUIL TONE OF VOICE,--"AND YOU MONSIEUR I MONSIEUR AM THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
DUMAS IS MISTAKEN
THE KING LISTENED WITH AS MUCH ATTENTION AS THE OTHERS AND WHEN THE LAST NAME HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED HE NOTICED THAT LA VALLIERE HAD BEEN OMITTED FROM THE LIST
NO GENTLEMEN SAID THE CAPTAIN
HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BUT BECAUSE OF THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR HE DOES NOT PRESS FOR AN AUDIENCE THIS EVENING AND IS SATISFIED TO HAVE HIS PRESENCE HERE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED M
MANICAMP AND M
AMONG THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS WHICH OCCUPY YOUR MIND SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA THERE MUST SURELY BE ONE THAT ABSORBS IT MORE THAN OTHERS ONE HAS INDEED OCCUPIED ME MORE THAN ANY OTHER WELL WHAT IS IT
EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION--A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED
I ALONE COMMAND HERE ALL YIELD OBEDIENCE TO ME
HE WANTED TO KILL ME I CAN WELL BELIEVE IT LAUGHED RAOUL
AND HE SOON AFTER JOINED THE LADIES OF HONOR WHO WERE WALKING ABOUT IN THE FLOWER-GARDENS
D'ARTAGNAN BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT M
ON MALICORNE'S ARRIVAL AT ORLEANS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD JUST SET OUT FOR PARIS
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S MIND IS PERVERTED
IF THEREFORE THESE TWO SHEPHERDS THOUGHT THEMSELVES BELOVED,--IF THEY WERE HAPPY IN THAT IDEA AND IF INSTEAD OF THAT HAPPINESS THEY MEET NOT ONLY THAT EMPTY VOID WHICH RESEMBLES DEATH BUT JEERS AND JESTS AT LOVE ITSELF WHICH IS WORSE THAN A THOUSAND DEATHS,--IN THAT CASE I SAY THAT TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS ARE THE TWO MOST UNHAPPY MEN I KNOW AND YOU ARE RIGHT TOO MONSIEUR DE GUICHE SAID THE KING
THE KING THE CENTER OF THESE EFFUSIONS AND OF THIS RESPECTFUL HOMAGE IMPOSED SILENCE UPON THOSE EXPATIATORS FOR WHOM IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO EXHAUST THEIR RAPTURES AND HE RODE AWAY FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING EVEN THROUGH THE SILKEN CURTAINS THE MODESTY OF THE WOMAN AND THE DIGNITY OF THE PRINCESS
IS NOT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS JEALOUS OF MADAME
WHO IS HE THE GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE YES I REMEMBER
I MEAN YOU TURN TO ME IN MISFORTUNE NOTHING MORE
IT IS NATURAL ENOUGH ARAMIS SHOOK HIS HEAD
THEREFORE SIRE WITH YOUR ROYAL PERMISSION I WILL CHOOSE ONE WHO SHALL APPEAR TO ME THE LEAST LIKELY TO DISTRACT YOUR ATTENTION AND WHO WILL LEAVE MY IMAGE INTACT AND UNSHADOWED IN YOUR HEART HAPPILY FOR ME SAID THE KING YOUR HEART IS NOT HARD AND UNFEELING
AT LAST HOWEVER MONSIEUR COULD CONTROL HIMSELF NO LONGER AND AT THE DESSERT RISING FROM THE TABLE IN EXCESSIVE WRATH AS WE HAVE RELATED HE LEFT THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE TO FINISH HIS BREAKFAST AS HE PLEASED
THIS MORNING AS HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO ATTEND MASS THE KING SEEING ME AS HE PASSED SIGNED TO ME TO APPROACH WHICH I ACCORDINGLY DID
BUT I HAVE RECEIVED POSITIVE COMMANDS
BUT FOUQUET BY HIS POLITENESS HIS THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION AND HIS GENEROSITY HAD INJURED COLBERT MORE DEEPLY THAN THE LATTER BY HIS ARTIFICE HIS ILL-WILL AND HIS PERSEVERING HATRED HAD EVER YET SUCCEEDED IN HURTING FOUQUET
SHE COULD FIND NOTHING TO SAY IN REPLY
BUT HE HAD NEVER LEARNED UNDER WHAT TITLE OR CONDITIONS DE GUICHE HAD CONFERRED HIS PROTECTION UPON LA VALLIERE
HE HAS THE VERY HAPPIEST DISPOSITION THAT CAN BE MET WITH WELL THEN MY DEAR DE GUICHE INFORM HIM OF HIS NOMINATION
SHE TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT A WOLF OR A ROBBER
SHE WAS ABOUT FIVE-AND-TWENTY YEARS OF AGE SLENDER IN FORM OF A PALE COMPLEXION AND FAIR-HAIRED
I STAY I PROPHESY THEN SAID RAOUL SADLY THAT MISFORTUNE WILL BEFALL YOU DE GUICHE I TOO AM A PROPHET BUT NOT A PROPHET OF EVIL
CERTAINLY NOT AM I SO VERY SEVERE THEN SAID RAOUL INQUIRINGLY
FOUQUET PAYS ME ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED LIVRES A YEAR FOR HIS PEW IN THE CHURCH WELL M
ONLY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT I MUST LAUGH ALONE BUT EXPLAIN YOURSELF WHEN THE PROPER TIME COMES I WILL EXPLAIN ALL
BUT SINCE HE HAD HIMSELF UNDERTAKEN THE CONDUCT OF STATE AFFAIRS THE DURATION OF THE MORNING AND EVENING'S VISIT HAD BEEN REDUCED BY ONE HALF
RAOUL STEPPED BACK TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE MUSKETEER
AND MONEY SINCE THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE WHO FARM THE REVENUE IS SCARCE
YOUR VIOLET-COLORED SUIT EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BECOMES YOU ADMIRABLY
DOES IT GIVE YOU THE GUARANTEE YOU REQUIRE I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THE NAME WHAT
ONE MOMENT MORE FOR I HAVE YET ANOTHER WORD TO ADD
WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID THE CHEVALIER
EH
EH
EH
GIVE ME YOUR HAND DO NOT KEEP ME WAITING THUS
SUDDENLY MALICORNE'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN TONES OF ENTREATY
I COULD NOT GUESS THE KING WAS IN LOVE WHEN THE KING'S AFFECTION WAS NOT EVEN YET IN EXISTENCE AS YOU PLEASE REPLIED ARAMIS
BAD-HEARTED MAN OH MONTALAIS
THAT THEN SAID BUCKINGHAM IS ANOTHER MATTER PRECISELY SO SAID DE WARDES
THEY STAND CONDEMNED
SUCH INDEED IS MY OWN CASE
THEY WERE ENTREATED TO LEAVE AND WERE NOT LAUGHED AT NO MURMURED ANNE OF AUSTRIA THEY WERE NOT FORGOTTEN
REFUSE NAY SIRE
YES YES I AM SURE OF IT
A WOMAN LOVES HIM
WILL IT BE AGREEABLE TO YOUR LORDSHIP TO BREAKFAST NOW SAID HE
THEIR SWORDS CROSSED
I THINK THAT YOU MUST BY SOME MEANS OR ANOTHER ASSURE YOURSELF OF THE TRUTH EITHER THAT THE LETTER HAS OR HAS NOT REACHED LA VALLIERE
THE PORTRAIT OF MADAME
SO BUCKINGHAM LAUGHED AND SPENT HIS MONEY
ON HER SIDE MONTALAIS WAS NO MISER WITH STORIES
WILL YOU COME DE WARDES TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL GET DROWNED SAID MANICAMP
THE PRINCESS--WHO WAS ROBED IN A LONG DRESS DIAPHANOUS AND LIGHT AS THE FINEST NETWORK TISSUE FROM THE HANDS OF SKILLFUL MECHLIN WORKERS ONE KNEE OCCASIONALLY REVEALED BENEATH THE FOLDS OF THE TUNIC AND HER LITTLE FEET ENCASED IN SILKEN SLIPPERS DECKED WITH PEARLS--ADVANCED RADIANT WITH BEAUTY ACCOMPANIED BY HER CORTEGE OF BACCHANTES AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE SPOT ASSIGNED TO HER IN THE DANCE
WHILE THE LIST WAS BEING READ THE KING HAD NOT TAKEN HIS EYES OFF THE YOUNG GIRL WHO SEEMED TO EXPAND AS IT WERE BENEATH THE HAPPY INFLUENCE SHE FELT WAS SHED AROUND HER AND WHO WAS DELIGHTED AND TOO PURE IN SPIRIT FOR ANY OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF LOVE TO FIND AN ENTRANCE EITHER TO HER MIND OR HER HEART
NAY I WOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT IT SIRE CAN YOU EVEN NOW PREVENT MONSIEUR FROM BEING JEALOUS OF THE FIRST PERSON WHO MAY APPROACH
I KNOW OF NONE NOT ONE BUT I KNOW ONE UNLESS IT BE MONSIEUR SAID FOUQUET LOOKING AT ARAMIS UNEASILY
THINK AGAIN I BEG YOU TAKE THE MIDDLE PATH BUT THERE ARE FOUR SO THERE ARE
HE HAD BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A POET IN HIS YOUTH BUT HIS HEART WAS HARD AND INDIFFERENT AS THE HEART OF EVERY MAN OF FIFTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE IS WHO HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO WOMEN IN HIS LIFETIME OR RATHER WHO HAS BEEN PASSIONATELY LOVED BY THEM
AFTERWARDS AGAINST BUCKINGHAM
IT IS WELL SAID THE FRANCISCAN AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE JESUIT AND THE DOCTOR HE ADDED LEAVE US ALONE A DIRECTION THEY INSTANTLY OBEYED
DISAPPEARING WITHOUT CASTING A LOOK BEHIND HER
YOU ARE NOT CHANGEABLE IN YOUR TASTES
IN FACT ALL THE APARTMENTS OF THE HOTEL WERE ENGAGED AND RETAINED BY CERTAIN STRANGERS WHO NEVER STIRRED OUT WHO WERE INCOMMUNICATIVE IN THEIR ADDRESS WITH COUNTENANCES FULL OF THOUGHTFUL PREOCCUPATION AND NOT ONE OF WHOM WAS KNOWN TO MALICORNE
IT AGREES SO WONDERFULLY WITH MY OWN VIEWS AND ARRANGEMENTS WHAT ARRANGEMENTS DO YOU ALLUDE TO THAT YOU WILL GET THE BRACELETS FOR INSTANCE IN THAT CASE IT WILL NOT BE THE KING OH SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA THERE IS NOT SUCH A VERY GREAT DISTANCE BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY'S HEART AND YOUR OWN
BUT THIS I PROMISE TO DO
NO ONE THINKS OF KILLING YOU NOR EVEN OF ROBBING YOU EVEN OF YOUR SECRET
SHE HOWEVER HALF-CONCEALED BENEATH THE THICK CURTAINS OF THE VELVET AND GOLD WHICH SHELTERED HER HAD NOT LISTENED TO THE DISCUSSION HAVING BEEN OCCUPIED IN WATCHING THE COMTE DE GUICHE WHO WAS CONVERSING WITH RAOUL
IT IS REALLY VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU ARE NOT THE EGERIA OF M
THE REPAST FINISHED BUCKINGHAM DARTED FORWARD TO HAND MADAME HENRIETTA FROM THE TABLE
IN OTHER WORDS THE MOST DANGEROUS KIND OF COQUETTE THE WORLD POSSESSES OH
YOU HAVE DISPLEASED ME NAY DO NOT DENY IT FOR I REMEMBER IT WELL OUR ALLIANCE SHALL DATE FROM TO-DAY EXCLAIMED THE KING WITH A WARMTH THAT WAS NOT ASSUMED
NAY COMTE LET US PROCEED IN DUE ORDER RETURNED MADAME
WHAT OTHER FAVOR MORE PRECIOUS THAN YOURSELF COULD THE KING CONFER UPON ME
THE FIRST THAT THE YOUNG MEN HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO EACH OTHER
BUT THAT IS A SUFFICIENT MISFORTUNE WITHOUT THE NOBLES THEMSELVES LAUGHING AT IT UPON MY WORD DE GUICHE YOU'RE QUITE A PURITAN AS THE ENGLISH SAY AT THIS MOMENT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE WAS ANNOUNCED BY ONE OF THE SERVANTS IN THE COURTYARD IN PRECISELY THE SAME MANNER AS HE WOULD HAVE DONE IN A ROOM
HE IS GIVING ORDERS PERSONALLY TO THE WORKMEN WHO ARE ARRANGING THE LAMPS FOR THE ILLUMINATIONS THANK YOU SAID FOUQUET WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD WHICH INDICATED THAT HE HAD OBTAINED ALL THE INFORMATION HE WISHED
ON THE CONTRARY HE IS QUITE YOUNG IS HIS CRIME THEN VERY HEINOUS UNPARDONABLE HAS HE ASSASSINATED ANY ONE BAH AN INCENDIARY THEN BAH HAS HE SLANDERED ANY ONE NO NO
IF THERE WAS ANY ONE IN PARTICULAR WHOSE HIGH SPIRITS AND GOOD-HUMOR EQUALLED THE KING'S IT WAS M
POOR WOMAN SO SIMPLE-MINDED
AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR MALICORNE
I ADDED EVEN MORE FOR I SAID LEARN MY LORD THAT WE GENTLEMEN OF FRANCE DEVOTE OURSELVES TO OUR SOVEREIGNS BY SACRIFICING THEM OUR AFFECTIONS AS WELL AS OUR FORTUNES AND OUR LIVES
SHE IS ONE OF THOSE OVERNICE AND AFFECTEDLY PARTICULAR PEOPLE WHO PLACE HEAVEN IN THE FOREGROUND IN ORDER TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND IT
AND MY LOOKS MY HAND MY LIPS TURN IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS YOU EVEN WERE THE WHOLE WORLD TO GUESS MY SECRET WHILE THESE WORDS ESCAPED FROM THE KING'S LIPS IN A STREAM OF WILD AFFECTION MADAME BLUSHED BREATHLESS HAPPY PROUD ALMOST INTOXICATED WITH DELIGHT
THAT DAY YOU WERE TRULY MINE MONSIEUR SIRE IT IS NOT OF THAT DAY I WOULD SPEAK
ALL THIS GILDED ELEGANCE OF THE COURT ALL THESE INTRIGUES SICKEN ME
IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE MEN FOOTNOTE 9
IT IS M
AND DE GUICHE'S DEFEAT WAS ACCORDINGLY ATTRIBUTED BY THE GREATER NUMBER PRESENT TO HIS COURTIER-LIKE TACT AND ABILITY
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT EXPLAIN YOURSELF YOU REPRESENTED A DIVINITY BEAUTIFUL DISDAINFUL INCONSTANT YOU MEAN POMONA COMTE I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS MADAME REMAINED SILENT FOR A MOMENT WITH HER LIPS COMPRESSED AND THEN OBSERVED,--"BUT COMTE YOU TOO ARE AN EXCELLENT DANCER NAY MADAME I AM ONLY ONE OF THOSE WHO ARE NEVER NOTICED OR WHO ARE SOON FORGOTTEN IF THEY EVER HAPPEN TO BE NOTICED WITH THIS REMARK ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OF THOSE DEEP SIGHS WHICH AFFECT THE REMOTEST FIBERS OF ONE'S BEING HIS HEART BURDENED WITH SORROW AND THROBBING FAST HIS HEAD ON FIRE AND HIS GAZE WANDERING HE BOWED BREATHLESSLY AND WITHDREW BEHIND THE THICKET
AND NOT ONLY DO I POSSESS HIS SWORD BUT HE HAS HIMSELF TAUGHT ME HOW TO USE IT
THE KING DID NOT WISH OR RATHER M
I WISH TO APPROACH A PARTICULAR HOUSE WHERE I HAVE SOME BUSINESS YOU MUST GET NEAR THE HOUSE THEN SAID MANICAMP
MONTALAIS MUST BE AS MUCH EMBARRASSED AS LA VALLIERE AND YOURSELF LESS SO FOR SHE IS LESS COMPROMISED HAVING SAID LESS THAT DOES NOT MATTER
COME LET US RECKON UP THE CHANCES IN ITS FAVOR I WILL COUNT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DREAM
FOR ON THE DAYS SHE WORE THEM IT WAS CONSIDERED AS A FAVOR TO BE ADMITTED TO ADMIRE THEM IN KISSING HER HANDS
THAT IS WELL M
SHE HAS A LETTER TO GIVE ME FOR HIS MAJESTY CHARLES II YOU WILL FIND HER ALONE FOR MONSIEUR HAS GONE OUT
THE EVENTS IN THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS OCCURRED IN 1661 FOOTNOTE 4
DE MAZARIN HE FOUND HIMSELF TREATED AS A MAN
DE GUICHE STANDING WITHIN THE EMBRASURE OF ONE OF THE WINDOWS SAW NO ONE BUT MADAME
DEAREST CONTINUED MARGUERITE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY QUESTION OF M
THE RESPECT PUT RESPECT OUT OF THE WAY FOR YOU FAIL IN IT EVERY DAY
BY DEGREES THE DUKE'S ENTIRE EQUIPAGE WAS TRANSPORTED ON BOARD THE YACHT
THE KING INSTINCTIVELY ON NOTICING FOUQUET TURNED TOWARDS COLBERT WHO WAS SMILING AND SEEMED FULL OF BENEVOLENCE AND DELIGHT A STATE OF FEELING WHICH HAD ARISEN FROM THE VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SECRETARIES HAD ENTERED AND HANDED HIM A POCKET-BOOK WHICH HE HAD PUT UNOPENED INTO HIS POCKET
HER HEART THEREFORE SENT THE BLOOD TO HER FACE
YES THE PORTRAIT
HE WILL GUIDE ME AND IF WE LOSE OURSELVES BOTH OF US WILL BE LOST AND THE ONE WILL SAVE THE OTHER
FOR YOUR GRACE SAID THE LACKEY IN A LOW TONE HANDING ARAMIS A LETTER
IT IS NOT RESPECTFUL THAT A SIMPLE GENTLEMAN SUCH AS I AM SHOULD WRITE TO HIS SOVEREIGN
HE JUMBLED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS TOGETHER WHICH WAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY SOME OF THE NOBLEMEN WHO HAD RETAINED THOSE HABITS SINCE THE TIME OF MONSIEUR MAZARIN--WHO HAD A POOR MEMORY BUT WAS A GOOD CALCULATOR
BESIDES IF YOU WILL LISTEN TO ME SHE CONTINUED LOOKING ROUND ON ALL SIDES I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR OWN DUTY SUCH AS I IMAGINE IT TO BE AND IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND A HINT WHAT IS MADAME'S DESIRE ON THE SUBJECT AND MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS IN SUCH A TONE AS TO LEAVE NO DOUBT IN HER COMPANION'S MINDS UPON THE OFFICIAL CHARACTER WITH WHICH SHE WAS INVESTED
FOUQUET COLLECTED HIMSELF A MOMENT AND THEN WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EMOTION SAID THE EVENING HAS COST ME FOUR MILLIONS AND A BITTER LAUGH DROWNED THE LAST VIBRATION OF THESE WORDS
I HAVE M
THERE IS BUT LITTLE OCCASION FOR THAT HE REPLIED
THE POOR DUKE COULD PERCEIVE THAT THE IMAGE OF THAT COUNTRY SO CHERISHED BY HIMSELF BECAME FROM DAY TO DAY MORE AND MORE EFFACED IN MADAME'S MIND IN EXACT PROPORTION AS HER AFFECTION FOR FRANCE BECAME MORE DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON HER HEART
PATIENCE MADEMOISELLE YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF OF CONSEQUENCE
DE BRAGELONNE DO NOT YOU ACCOMPANY ME DE GUICHE BOWED AND SAID BOTH M
AND IN 1659 EIGHTY ALSO AH SAID ARAMIS
THEN AS WITH THE INSTINCT OF A BLOODHOUND HE WAS ABOUT TO FOLLOW THEM ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO HAD BEEN RUNNING AFTER HIM ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
AMYNTAS REAPED THE BENEFIT OF IT IN THE APPLAUSE BESTOWED UPON HIM
GO SHE SAID
HIS FRIEND'S AMAZED LOOK AND THE ENCOURAGING GESTURE OF THE QUEEN RESTORED GUICHE TO HIS SELF-POSSESSION
STAY I HAVE IT;--THERE IS A MALICORNE AT ORLEANS WHO LENDS MONEY TO THE PRINCE I THINK THAT MUST BE MY FATHER MONSIEUR AH
THE PEDAGOGUE IS HERE AND HAS OVERHEARD YOU DE WARDES AT THE SOUND OF RAOUL'S VOICE WHICH HE RECOGNIZED WITHOUT HAVING OCCASION TO LOOK AT HIM HALF DREW HIS SWORD
CONFESS THAT YOU ARE DYING WITH THE WISH TO SEE RAOUL AGAIN I CANNOT CONFESS THAT THEN YOU ARE WRONG IN WHAT WAY BECAUSE--DO YOU NOT SEE THIS BREVET TO BE SURE I DO WELL I WOULD HAVE GOT YOU A SIMILAR ONE BY WHOSE MEANS MALICORNE'S AURE ARE YOU TELLING THE TRUTH
I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY YOU ARE A POET MY DEAR COUNT AND FIND SUBJECTS FOR YOUR MUSE EVERYWHERE I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH WHERE IT DOES NOT EXIST NAY WHERE IT DOES EXIST DO YOU NOT THINK YOU ARE DECEIVING YOURSELF GUICHE I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT
AND IT WILL BE FAR PREFERABLE SINCE IT WILL BE THE MOST TRUTHFUL EXPRESSION OF YOUR OWN SENTIMENTS I SUBSCRIBE TO IT SAID DE WARDES
YOU WITHOUT BELIEF
DE GUICHE HAVING MADE HIMSELF MORE AGREEABLE TO HER THAN I COULD SHE RECEIVES HIM AT EVERY AND ANY HOUR THE DUKE COLORED
BUT THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION
MY LORD SHE SAID IT IS HARDLY BECOMING THAT YOU SHOULD ALLOW MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF TO LAND WITHOUT HAVING PREVIOUSLY ASCERTAINED THAT OUR APARTMENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED
AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS PUNISHMENT OUGHT TO BE SO TOO LASTING NO DOUBT OF IT UNLESS HE IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH THE SMALL-POX AND EVEN THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR WE NEVER GET ANY IMPURE AIR HERE NOTHING CAN BE MORE INGENIOUS THAN YOUR TRAIN OF REASONING MY DEAR M
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING DEAREST LOUISE HE REPLIED WITH THAT QUIET COMPOSED MANNER WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HIM I AM GOING TO ENGLAND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN ENGLAND THE KING HAS SENT ME THERE THE KING EXCLAIMED LOUISE AND AURE TOGETHER INVOLUNTARILY EXCHANGING GLANCES THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD JUST BEEN INTERRUPTED RECURRING TO THEM BOTH
SO YOU HAVE BEEN TO SEE MY OLD FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN
FOR THE BEAUTIFUL DIANA OF POITIERS AND LATER STILL TO THOSE OF HENRY IV
POSSESSING THAT ONE REIGNS A QUEEN AMONG WOMEN IN CASES WHERE PROVIDENCE HAS WITHHELD THAT PRECIOUS FACULTY OF HOLDING ONE'S HEART AND MIND IN CHECK HOW CLEVER YOU ARE SAID MONTALAIS AND HOW WELL YOU UNDERSTAND THE DUTY WOMEN OWE THEMSELVES I AM ONLY SETTLING A CASE OF INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS SAID ATHENAIS MODESTLY
SAINT-AIGNAN FOLLOWED HIM LEAVING THE ROOMS IN AS MUCH DESPAIR AS HE HAD ENTERED THEM WITH DELIGHT
PORTHOS IS AT SAINT-MANDE
FOUR--AN EVEN NUMBER INFAMOUS MURMURED MADAME DE BELLIERE TORTURED BY HER FRIEND'S MERCILESS DELIGHT
STAY WITH HIM MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS
I DO NOT FIND MADAME HE SAID EITHER GOOD OR BAD LOOKING YET RATHER GOOD THAN BAD LOOKING WHAT
THERE I AM KNOWN AND APPRECIATED
DE LA VALLIERE IS LAME AS HE SAID THIS HE NOTICED THAT BRAGELONNE WHO HAD JUST AT THAT MOMENT ENTERED THE COURTYARD TURNED SUDDENLY PALE
DE BAISEMEAUX WAS SHOWING ARAMIS THE PRISONERS IN THE BASTILE A CARRIAGE DREW UP AT MADAME DE BELLIERE'S DOOR AND AT THAT STILL EARLY HOUR A YOUNG WOMAN ALIGHTED HER HEAD MUFFLED IN A SILK HOOD
I KNOW HOW PERFECTLY INNOCENT YOU ARE AND I SHALL GIVE A GOOD ACCOUNT OF YOU
AFTER THAT COME COUNCILORS OF PARLIAMENT WHO BRING ME FIFTEEN FRANCS AND I HAVE SIX OF THEM I DID NOT KNOW SAID ARAMIS THAT COUNCILORS WERE SO PRODUCTIVE YES
THE KING WITH ONE HAND DREW HER TOWARDS HIS HEART AND STRETCHED THE OTHER ABOVE HER HEAD AS THOUGH TO SHIELD HER FROM THE LIGHTNING
BUT ONCE DISEMBARKED HE WILL OCCUPY IT OH
INTRODUCTION
IT IS INDEED EXTRAORDINARY HE MURMURED
DO YOU NOT THINK SO LA VALLIERE WHY DO YOU ASK ME
THE KING YESTERDAY REQUIRED A SUPPLY OF MONEY FROM ME YES FOUR MILLIONS
GOOD HEAVENS SHE EXCLAIMED HIDING HER FACE IN BOTH HER HANDS
THE YOUNG GIRL COULD NOT REPRESS A CRY OF TERROR
I SAID MADAME'S KNIGHT HAS SHE A RECOGNIZED KNIGHT THEN ONE WOULD THINK YOU CAN JUDGE OF THAT FOR YOURSELF
IN THAT CASE THE RESULT WILL BE THAT WHICH YOU THINK YOU WILL PREVENT SAID DE WARDES LAUGHING
WHY SHE SAID
DE BRAGELONNE I AM THE BEARER OF A THOUSAND COMPLIMENTS FROM A LADY TO YOU RAOUL COLORED
NO CERTAINLY NOT NOT EVEN TO SATISFY YOURSELF OF THE RESEMBLANCE WHICH YOU DENY AS YOU DO THE CARPETS SOME SPECTRAL-LOOKING PERSON A MERE SHADOW
A CRY OF DISTRESS ESCAPED HIM
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION ABANDONED ENTIRELY TO A REMEMBRANCE WHICH EVOKED ALL THE PAST IN HER HEART SHE LOOKED ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS IN THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH WHEN HER PALACE WAS OPEN TO THE VISITS OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM'S FATHER THEN A YOUNG AND IMPASSIONED MAN AS WELL AS AN UNFORTUNATE PRINCE WHO LIVED FOR HER ALONE AND DIED WITH HER NAME UPON HIS LIPS
LET HIM ENTER BY ALL MEANS AND HE ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARD THE DOOR
THE DIAMONDS IN POINT OF INTRINSIC VALUE DID NOT REPRESENT A VERY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT BUT THE ORIGINALITY AND RARITY OF THE WORKMANSHIP WERE SUCH THAT EVERY ONE AT COURT NOT ONLY WISHED TO POSSESS THE BRACELETS BUT EVEN TO SEE THE QUEEN HERSELF WEAR THEM
I DREAM OF EMPERORS AND I FIND ONLY AURE AURE EXCLAIMED LA VALLIERE FOR PITY'S SAKE DO NOT FOR THE PLEASURE OF SAYING SOMETHING WITTY SACRIFICE THOSE WHO LOVE YOU WITH SUCH DEVOTED AFFECTION OH I DO NOT TROUBLE MYSELF MUCH ABOUT THAT
IN OTHER RESPECTS AS IMPENETRABLE AS THAT OF DANAE NOTWITHSTANDING DANAE'S TOWER WAS MADE OF BRASS YOU ARE WITTY MARGUERITE SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE ANGRILY
BUT AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR HE FOUND ARAMIS WHO WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS LIKE THE STATUE OF HARPOCRATES THE GOD OF SILENCE BY A LOOK MOTIONED HIM BACK TO THE END OF THE APARTMENT

ALTHOUGH HIS MAJESTY WAS VERY MUCH PREOCCUPIED HE GAVE THE GLANCE OF A MASTER AT THE TWO ROWS OF YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL GIRLS WHO MODESTLY CAST DOWN THEIR EYES BLUSHING AS THEY FELT THE KING'S GAZE FALL UPON THEM
THE ADVANCEMENT OF YOUR FAMILY WAS CRUELLY NEGLECTED BY MY UNCLE ON THE CONTRARY SIRE
THAT A FEW DAYS AGO MONSIEUR COMPLAINED OF IT EVEN TO THE QUEEN-MOTHER
FOUQUET WITHDREW WITHOUT ANY PARADE OR WEAKNESS SMILING AT HIS NUMEROUS FRIENDS IN WHOSE COUNTENANCES ALONE HE READ THE SINCERITY OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP--AN INTEREST PARTAKING OF COMPASSION
WHY YOU ARE AS HANDSOME AS AMADIS MONSIEUR DE BRAGELONNE SHE CRIED TO RAOUL AND ARMED AND BOOTED LIKE HIM A THOUSAND COMPLIMENTS YOUNG LADIES REPLIED RAOUL BOWING
AT THIS VERY MOMENT THEY ARE SEEKING YOU IN EVERY DIRECTION
WELL SAID DE GUICHE RESIGNING HIMSELF LEAD ME WHERE YOU LIKE AND ASK ME WHAT YOU PLEASE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN YOU ARE AND THEN AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAINT-AIGNAN CONTINUED I WISH YOU TO TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT A CERTAIN PERSON IN WHO YOU HAVE INTERESTED YOURSELF AND WITH WHOM YOU ARE IN LOVE I WILL NEITHER ADMIT NOR DENY IT
OH SHE IS THE MOST POLITE DIVINITY IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE
I SUSPECTED IT HE CONTINUED--"ANOTHER APPLICATION FOR AN APPOINTMENT UNDER MONSIEUR
HE WORE ALSO MECHLIN LACE AS RARE AND BEAUTIFUL IN ITS OWN WAY AS THE JEWELS OF MONSIEUR IN THEIRS
I ENTREAT YOU MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS NOT TO LEAVE ME HERE
YES REPEATED LOUIS WHICH WOULD KILL ME I SAY
FROM MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS THANK YOU MONSIEUR
WHAT I HAD STILL TO DO ON EARTH WAS URGENT
NAY BUT TELL ME REPEATED LA VALLIERE VEHEMENTLY
HOW TOO CAN ONE EXPLAIN THE UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF ARAMIS AT THE HOTEL--HE WHO HAD ENTERED THE CHATEAU WITH M
BUT MY DEAR HOST SAID ARAMIS CLOSING THE REGISTER IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE ARE SUMMONED BAISEMEAUX TOOK THE REGISTER HASTILY RESTORED IT TO ITS PLACE IN THE CLOSET WHICH HE LOCKED AND PUT THE KEY IN HIS POCKET
I SHALL NOT RETURN SAID BUCKINGHAM YOUNG AS I AM
THE POOL IS INCREASING EVERY MINUTE AND THE ISLE IS GRADUALLY DISAPPEARING
YOU ARE UNFORTUNATE IN YOUR PHRASES WHAT PHRASE MONSEIGNEUR YOU SAID TREATED WITH GREAT FAVOR WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FAVOR NOTHING CAN BE MORE SIMPLE SAID THE CHEVALIER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF GREAT FRANKNESS
AT THIS MOMENT LA VALLIERE WHO HAD HITHERTO KEPT HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GALLERY SUDDENLY CAST THEM DOWN AS THE KING ENTERED
BUT RECOVERING HERSELF IMMEDIATELY SHE SAID YOU CAME HERE WITH SOME INTENTION OR ANOTHER I SUPPOSE CERTAINLY WHAT WAS IT I CAME MADAME INTENDING TO COMPLAIN ENERGETICALLY AND TO INFORM YOU THAT I WILL NOT SUBMIT TO SUCH BEHAVIOR FROM THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO THEN I SHALL COMPLAIN TO THE KING AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE KING TO REPLY VERY WELL THEN SAID MONSIEUR WITH AN EXPRESSION OF STERN DETERMINATION ON HIS COUNTENANCE WHICH OFFERED A SINGULAR CONTRAST TO ITS USUAL GENTLENESS
I THINK MATTERS LOOK WELL SAID MANICAMP WHO FANCIED HE COULD READ THIS FRIENDLY DISPOSITION UPON HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COUNTENANCE
DE GUICHE M
AND AS FOR HIM HE ONLY LOOKED FOR WORTHIER EARS THAN OTHERS HE HAD FOUND TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RECOUNTING THE EVENT IN ALL ITS DETAILS
AND GUICHE KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL THAT I REGARD HIM AS A MOST FINISHED CAVALIER WELL SINCE THAT IS DECIDED I RESUME
MONSIEUR IS JEALOUS OF GUICHE
NEXT AT A TROT
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY TREAT THESE POOR FELLOWS WHO ARE OF SOME GOOD AT ALL EVENTS OTHERWISE THAN AS A COUNCILOR OF PARLIAMENT YES YOU ARE RIGHT
DO NOT FORGET I BEG THAT HE IS ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS AND THAT A GENTLE RECEPTION OF HIM WILL PLEASE ME GREATLY WHAT EXILE
MONSIEUR WAS LEFT QUITE TO HIMSELF DURING THE TIME DEVOTED TO DRESSING AND DECORATING HIMSELF
THE MORE MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SHOWED HER AFFECTION THE MORE THE KING'S AFFECTION HAD INCREASED
AND WITH THE PERFECT TACT WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIS REFINED NATURE HE BOWED AND RETIRED
LET US STAY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND WHILE HE YIELDED TO THE PRESSURE OF DE GUICHE'S ARM HE REMAINED IN THE FLOWER-GARDEN ADJOINING THE CHATEAU
HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO REMOVE THE PRINCESSES FROM THE DECK OF A VESSEL WHERE THE ADMIRAL REIGNED SUPREME
MADAME GETS ME SENT INTO EXILE BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT CARE FOR ME SUFFICIENTLY
ANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SOME UNEASINESS
ETEXT 2609 FIRST IN THE NEW SERIES)--FIRST 75 CHAPTERS OF THE THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
AND SO COMTE THIS IS WHAT WE WILL AGREE TO
AND BE CAREFUL HOW YOU SET ME AT DEFIANCE FOR A BRANCH OF THIS CHESTNUT-TREE CAUSES ME A GOOD DEAL OF ANNOYANCE AND MAY PROVOKE ME TO EXTREME MEASURES
I AM GREATLY AFRAID SAID LA VALLIERE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING WORSE THAN A WOLF
RUN RUN AND HE FOLLOWED THE DUKE TOWARDS THE ANTE-CHAMBERS OF MADAME'S SUITE OF APARTMENTS AND WHEN THE USHERS WERE ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THEM THE CHEVALIER SAID LAUGHING HIS HIGHNESS WISHES TO SURPRISE MADAME CHAPTER XXXII
THE CREW LEANING AGAINST THE BULWARKS AND CLINGING TO THE SHROUDS CHEERED THE COURAGE OF THE TWO DARING YOUNG MEN THE SKILL OF THE PILOT AND THE STRENGTH OF THE SAILORS
IF I KNEW THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME I WOULD FORGIVE YOU AND I NOW DO SO WITH STILL GREATER REASON SINCE I AM IGNORANT OF THE WRONG YOU ALLUDE TO FOUQUET BIT HIS LIPS AS ARAMIS WOULD HAVE DONE
RAOUL SAID LOUISE INNOCENTLY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER AND I DO NOT SEE WHY I SHOULD NOT TELL IT YOU MYSELF
AND AFTER SO BE IT
LEAVE ME IN THE RANKS OF MIDDLE LIFE SIRE
A PAIR OF CANDLES OF YELLOW WAX WERE GUTTERING DOWN IN THE COPPER CANDLESTICKS AND STILL FURTHER INCREASED BY THEIR THICK SMOKE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM
OF WHAT IMPORTANCE IS THE MANNER MONSIEUR IN WHICH I HAVE LEARNT WHAT I KNOW SO THAT I KNOW IT SIRE SIRE SAID THE MUSKETEER WITHOUT SEEKING EVEN TO CONCEAL HIS DISSATISFACTION
THE INDIGNATION OF THE KING MAKING HIM FORGET EVERYTHING AND AMONG OTHERS THAT SAINT-AIGNAN WAS PRESENT WAS POURED OUT IN THE MOST VIOLENT IMPRECATIONS
ATHOS SLOWLY POINTED OUT TO HIM THE GRAFTS THE CUTTINGS AND THE AVENUES HE WAS PLANTING
YOU FORGET THAT FOUQUET SIGNED
HAVE NOT THE FOUR MILLIONS WHICH M
DO YOU SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE THAT FROM SOME MOTIVE OF WHICH WE KNOW NOTHING YOUR MAN DID NOT DELIVER THE LETTER TO HER FOUQUET RANG THE BELL
THAT WILL BE TWENTY-EIGHT LEAGUES I SHALL HAVE GONE FOR THE LOVE OF YOU THEN WITH HIS SARDONIC SMILE TAKING UP THE INTERRUPTED SENTENCE:--"THIS PLACE SAID HE AT FIRST GLANCE APPEARS TO HAVE COST MORE THAN THE FIRST
BAISEMEAUX DE MONTLEZUN GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE
YES I DO REPENT OF HAVING DRAWN MY SWORD ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESULTS THAT ACTION PRODUCED
AFTER THE PUBLIC ENTRY WAS OVER AND THE SPECTATORS IN THE STREETS HAD PARTIALLY DISPERSED AND THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC AND CHEERING OF THE CROWD COULD BE HEARD ONLY IN THE DISTANCE
WE WILL FIGHT WHEN WE GET THERE UPON THE SANDS WHICH ARE COVERED BY THE RISING TIDE AND WHICH FORM PART OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY DURING SIX HOURS OF THE DAY BUT BELONG TO THE TERRITORY OF HEAVEN DURING THE OTHER SIX I ACCEPT WILLINGLY SAID DE WARDES
DE GUICHE THE DISGRACED INDIVIDUAL YOU SPEAK OF THE EXILE IN QUESTION YES CERTAINLY RETURNED THE DUKE
WHO THREATENED YOU--WHO DARED TO THREATEN YOU THOSE WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SIRE I DO NOT RECOGNIZE ANY ONE AS POSSESSING THE RIGHT TO THREATEN THE HUMBLEST OF MY SUBJECTS FORGIVE ME SIRE BUT NEAR YOUR MAJESTY EVEN THERE ARE PERSONS SUFFICIENTLY HIGH IN POSITION TO HAVE OR TO BELIEVE THAT THEY POSSESS THE RIGHT OF INJURING A YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT FORTUNE AND POSSESSING ONLY HER REPUTATION IN WHAT WAY INJURE HER IN DEPRIVING HER OF HER REPUTATION BY DISGRACEFULLY EXPELLING HER FROM THE COURT OH
OH IT IS QUITE CLEAR YOU ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE ENGLISH
SAINT-AIGNAN WHO HAD CARRIED HIS DISCRETION SO FAR AS TO REMAIN WITHOUT STIRRING IN HIS CORNER PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY A TEAR RAN FORWARD AT THE KING'S SUMMONS
YOU WISE
COLBERT WHO MAKES ALL THESE FINE REPORTS TO THE KING M
BUT I TAKE CARE TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE THINKS ATHENAIS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT HUSH SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE I HEAR STEPS APPROACHING FROM THIS SIDE QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH REED-GRASS SAID MONTALAIS
MONSIEUR FAUCHEUX'S HORSES WERE SERVICEABLE ANIMALS WITH THICKSET KNEES AND LEGS THAT HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN MOVING
HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH TOO MUCH HAPPINESS FOR ANY ILL-FEELING TO REMAIN IN IT AT THAT MOMENT AT LEAST
IF I LIVED YOU WOULD FORGET ME
BRAGELONNE--AH
RAOUL ON BETAKING HIMSELF TO DE GUICHE FOUND HIM CONVERSING WITH DE WARDES AND MANICAMP
IT WAS A MAN WHO WAS LISTENING SUPPOSE IT WAS SO MADEMOISELLE WHAT GREAT HARM WAS THERE IN HIS HAVING LISTENED
YOU ARE OUTRAGING THOSE WHO LIKE OURSELVES HAVE COME TO SEEK A YOUNG LADY TO ESCORT HER TO HER HUSBAND YOU SPOKE TO HIM IN THAT MANNER ASKED GUICHE COLORING
STAY GENTLEMEN SAID RAOUL ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM AND PLACING HIS OWN DRAWN SWORD BETWEEN THE COMBATANTS THE AFFAIR IS HARDLY WORTH THE TROUBLE OF BLOOD BEING SHED ALMOST IN THE PRESENCE OF THE PRINCESS
EVERY LIBERTY AND EVERY INDULGENCE WHICH HIS WELFARE MAY REQUIRE
BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HAVING GIVEN YOU THAT ADVICE I SHOULD HAVE ADDED,--'LOUISE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO PASS WHOLE DAYS WITH YOUR HEAD DROOPING YOUR HANDS UNOCCUPIED YOUR EYES RESTLESS AND FULL OF THOUGHT
SHE WAS LOOKING ON AS THE MOST ADVENTUROUS AND YOUNGEST OF HER LADIES RAN TO AND FRO AND WITH HER BACK TURNED TO A HIGH HEDGE VERY IMPATIENTLY AWAITED THE ARRIVAL OF THE KING WITH WHOM SHE HAD APPOINTED THE RENDEZVOUS
I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL SAID FOUQUET THAT NO FRIEND COULD BE MORE INCOMPARABLE AND INVALUABLE THAN YOURSELF MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY
AND WHICH WAS ABOUT TO BRING INTO THE LAST NAMED CITY WHERE SHE WAS TO PRODUCE SO GREAT A REVOLUTION THE POOR LITTLE LA VALLIERE WHO WAS FAR FROM SUSPECTING AS SHE RETURNED JOYFULLY LEANING ON THE ARM OF HER MOTHER FOR WHAT A STRANGE FUTURE SHE WAS RESERVED
MY DEAR FRIEND IT IS A LONG TIME AGO SINCE I FINISHED MY EDUCATION YOU MEAN
IS HE A GENERAL THAT IS EXACTLY THE VERY TITLE THAT ONE OF THE BEARERS OF THE LITTER GAVE HIM AS HE SPOKE TO HIM IN A LOW TONE SO THAT SAID MONTALAIS
AN INTERESTING PALLOR OF COMPLEXION A LANGUID EXPRESSION OF THE EYES HIS WHITE HANDS SEEN THROUGH THE MASSES OF LACE THAT COVERED THEM THE MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION OF HIS MOUTH--IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY INDEED TO SEE M
I DO NOT ASK YOU WHAT YOU REQUIRED MY ADDRESS FOR
SET OFF EXCLAIMED THE CHEVALIER FEIGNING SURPRISE
SUPPOSE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ASKED YOU TO RENDER HIM A SERVICE I WOULD NOT RENDER IT TO HIM SELFISH FELLOW OR AT LEAST I WOULD ASK HIM WHAT SERVICE HE WOULD RENDER ME IN EXCHANGE AH
THIS WAS THE SIGNAL FOR FRENCH AND ENGLISH TO DO THE SAME
HE HAD HARDLY GONE A HUNDRED PACES WHEN HE MET TWO YOUNG MEN WALKING ARM IN ARM WITH THEIR HEADS BENT DOWN AND IDLY KICKING THE SMALL STONES OUT OF THEIR PATH AS THEY WALKED ON PLUNGED IN THOUGHT
HOW MANICAMP WITH GREATER CLEVERNESS THAN MALICORNE HAD SHOWN HAD SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING NEWS OF DE GUICHE OF THE SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION OF MONTALAIS WITH MALICORNE AND FINALLY OF THE BILLETS WITH WHICH THE COMTE DE SAINT-AIGNAN HAD FURNISHED MANICAMP AND MALICORNE
BUT I AM SO ACCUSTOMED TO YOUR REPROACHES THAT I PARDON YOU THESE IN THAT CASE LET US BEGONE LOUISE
AND HIS SEARCHING LOOK DETECTED HIS HOST'S SADNESS AND DISORDERED STATE OF MIND
IF M
IF M
DE GUICHE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND MADAME WHO FELT HOW PASSION COURSED THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF HIS BEING KNEW THAT HE INDEED LOVED TRULY
WHAT ARE HIS DUTIES NOTHING EXCEPT TO LOOK ABOUT AND MAKE HIS REPORT A SORT OF INTERIOR POLICE EXACTLY AH HOW EXCELLENTLY THAT WILL SUIT MALICORNE MANICAMP VENTURED TO SAY
NO ONE BUT DE GUICHE OR MANICAMP COULD HAVE WRITTEN TO THIS FELLOW
PEOPLE DON'T WEEP WITHOUT CAUSE
AND AS THE LACKEY CARRIED A TORCH IN HIS HAND HE PLACED HIMSELF BETWEEN THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE BISHOP OF VANNES SO THAT BOTH OF THEM COULD READ AT THE SAME TIME
HE REMAINED WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON LA VALLIERE'S HALF-CLOSED EYES AND HELD HER QUIESCENT HAND IN HIS OWN
THAT VOICE WHISPERED LOUIS EAGERLY TO SAINT-AIGNAN
IF THE INFORMATION WERE UNSATISFACTORY,--WHICH AFTER ALL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE,--HE WOULD EXAMINE HOW FAR THE KING CARED ABOUT LA VALLIERE AND MAKE USE OF HIS INFORMATION IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO GET RID OF THE GIRL ALTOGETHER AND THEREBY OBTAIN ALL THE MERIT OF HER BANISHMENT WITH ALL THE LADIES OF THE COURT WHO MIGHT HAVE THE LEAST PRETENSIONS TO THE KING'S HEART BEGINNING WITH MADAME AND FINISHING WITH THE QUEEN
BEHIND HIS MAJESTY AND HIS SISTER-IN-LAW CERTAIN OF THE COURTIERS THOSE AT LEAST WHO WERE SERIOUSLY DISPOSED OR WERE ANXIOUS TO BE WITHIN REACH OR UNDER THE EYES OF THE KING--FOLLOWED AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE RESTRAINING THEIR IMPATIENT HORSES REGULATING THEIR PACE BY THAT OF THE KING AND MADAME AND ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO ALL THE DELIGHT AND GRATIFICATION WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONVERSATION OF CLEVER PEOPLE WHO CAN WITH PERFECT COURTESY MAKE A THOUSAND ATROCIOUS BUT LAUGHABLE REMARKS ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS
THE FIVE-VOLUME EDITION GENERALLY DOES NOT GIVE TITLES TO THE SMALLER PORTIONS BUT THE OTHERS DO
D'ARTAGNAN IS NOW A LIEUTENANT OF MUSKETEERS AND HIS THREE FRIENDS HAVE RETIRED TO PRIVATE LIFE
THEREFORE AS I HAVE NEVER TAKEN ANY INTEREST IN HER AS I DO NOT KNOW HER I AM NOT ABLE TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU REQUIRE AND DE GUICHE MADE A MOVEMENT AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIS QUESTIONER
OTHERS GATHERED ROUND HER FOR HER DEFENSE AND THEY QUARRELLED AS THEY DANCED
HE NEXT WENT INTO THE GALLERIES AND WITH THE GREATEST COOLNESS THREW DOWN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AN ENAMELED VASE A PORPHYRY EWER AND A BRONZE CANDELABRUM
AT THIS MOMENT BAISEMEAUX HEARD THE JAILER APPROACHING
HENRIETTA WAS SURE TO BE ILLUSTRIOUS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER BORN IN A PALACE OR BORN IN OBSCURITY
RAOUL ENTERED THE ANTE-CHAMBER AT THE VERY MOMENT THE TWO MINISTERS QUITTED IT AND THE KING PERCEIVING HIM THROUGH THE HALF-CLOSED DOOR SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT M
MADAME HENRIETTE THE QUEEN-MOTHER WAS DAZZLED BY THE BRILLIANCY WHICH CAST DISTINCTION UPON HER FAMILY THANKS TO THE WIT OF THE GRAND-DAUGHTER OF HENRY IV
AS SOON AS IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT BUCKINGHAM WAS TO ACCOMPANY MADAME THE YOUNG DUKE SELECTED A CORPS OF GENTLEMEN AND OFFICERS TO FORM PART OF HIS OWN SUITE SO THAT IT WAS ALMOST AN ARMY THAT NOW SET OUT TOWARDS PARIS SCATTERING GOLD AND EXCITING THE LIVELIEST DEMONSTRATIONS AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT TOWNS AND VILLAGES ON THE ROUTE
HE WAS SO JEALOUS AT THE SIGHT THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST EXCLAIMING LIKE A CHILD WHAT
A SURPRISE FOR RAOUL
VERY GOOD SAID MONSIEUR THE IDEA IS A GOOD ONE
DE GUICHE IS HERE TO REPRESENT MONSIEUR
DE GUICHE WILL NOT REMAIN LONG IN THE SULKS
PASSING ONE HAD OVER HER BEAUTIFUL BROW SHE SIGHED HEAVILY
IN THIS MANNER HE WOULD BE ABLE TO AIR HIS GENEROSITY BEFORE THE POOR GIRL'S EYES AND SO KEEP HER IN CONSTANT SUSPENSE BETWEEN GRATITUDE AND APPREHENSION TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS TO MAKE HER A FRIEND AT COURT INTERESTED AS AN ACCOMPLICE IN TRYING TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE WHILE SHE WAS MAKING HER OWN
3 THE BOLDEST EVEN WHO HAD BEEN THE ASSOCIATES OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE HAD FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HELD ALOOF FROM HIM WITH A SORT OF NERVOUS APPREHENSION
SUDDENLY HIS GAZE BECAME FIXED LIKE THAT OF AN EAGLE ON ITS PREY
YOU ARE NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY REDUCED AND AT THE LAST MOMENT WE WILL SEE WHAT IS TO BE DONE WE SHALL SEE THEN IN A VERY SHORT TIME VERY WELL
DE BRAGELONNE I KNOW NOWHERE A NOBLER MIND THAN YOURS
OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS READERS WOULD ENJOY THE ADVENTURES OF THIS YOUTH AND HIS THREE FAMOUS FRIENDS PORTHOS ATHOS AND ARAMIS AS THEIR EXPLOITS UNRAVELED BEHIND THE SCENES OF SOME OF THE MOST MOMENTOUS EVENTS IN FRENCH AND EVEN ENGLISH HISTORY
IS IT NOT FACT SAID THE CHEVALIER PUTTING THE QUESTION TO THE COUNT HIMSELF IS IT NOT FACT DE GUICHE THAT THE SCENE WAS NOT SO TEMPESTUOUS AS THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SEEMS TO THINK AND WHO MOREOVER WAS NOT HIMSELF THERE WHETHER TEMPESTUOUS OR NOT PERSISTED RAOUL IT IS NOT PRECISELY OF THE SCENE ITSELF THAT I AM SPEAKING BUT OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY ENSUE
I WILL DO MY BEST DO DE GUICHE APPROACHED MALICORNE STEPPED ASIDE AND MANICAMP CAUGHT HOLD OF DE GUICHE WHO WAS THOUGHTFUL AND MELANCHOLY
THERE HAS BEEN PAYABLE TO THE FAMILY DURING THE LAST FIFTY-ONE YEARS A PENSION OF FIFTY THOUSAND LIVRES
AND IF YOU DO NOT SUCCEED SAID BAISEMEAUX AT LEAST BEG THAT HE MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE TEN-FRANC LIST BY WHICH BOTH HE AND I SHALL BE GAINERS IF THE OTHER PRISONER CALLS OUT FOR HIS MOTHER IN A SIMILAR MANNER SAID ARAMIS I PREFER NOT TO ENTER AT ALL BUT WILL TAKE MY MEASURE FROM OUTSIDE NO FEAR OF THAT MONSIEUR ARCHITECT THE ONE WE ARE NOW GOING TO SEE IS AS GENTLE AS A LAMB
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF MY DEAR M
COME COME SAID ATHOS I AM QUITE READY
LE COMTE DE GUICHE I GET UP SAID MANICAMP STRETCHING HIMSELF IN HIS BED COMPLACENTLY OH NO THANK YOU YOU HAVE SOLD ALL YOUR CLOTHES NO I HAVE ONE SUIT LEFT THE HANDSOMEST EVEN BUT I EXPECT A PURCHASER AND THE CHAUSSES WELL IF YOU LOOK YOU WILL SEE THEM ON THAT CHAIR VERY WELL
IT WOULD BE FOLLY OR PRIDE TO ADVISE YOU TO TAKE FOR THE HEROINE OF AN ASSUMED AFFECTION A WOMAN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE ONE FOR WHOM YOU PRETEND TO FEEL REAL REGARD THE KING TRIED TO TAKE MADAME'S HAND IN HIS OWN
AND EACH WALK HAD ITS HORIZON IN THE DISTANCE CONSISTING OF ABOUT A HAND-BREADTH OF SKY APPARENT THROUGH THE INTERLACING OF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES
BUT I CLAIM YOUR ATTENTION WHEREVER I MAY REQUIRE YOUR SERVICES I AM ALWAYS AT THE KING'S SERVICE REPLIED FOUQUET
AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE THEREFORE YOUR GRACE SAID DE WARDES WHO DREW HIS SWORD A MOVEMENT IMITATED BY THE DUKE
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU WELL
COLBERT PAY THEM SINCE YOU HAVE PROMISED TO DO SO CERTAINLY SIRE
ONE WORD IN ANSWER ONE WORD ONLY
AND I IMPLORE YOUR MAJESTY TO GRANT ME THE FAVOR OF AN AUDIENCE WHICH WILL ENABLE ME TO CONFESS THE TRUTH TO MY SOVEREIGN
MADAME ALREADY INFORMED IS WRITING THE LETTER WHICH SHE IS GOOD ENOUGH TO DO ME THE HONOR OF INTRUSTING TO ME
YOU ARE AMUSING YOURSELVES HERE WHILE I AM SICK AND TIRED OF BEING ALONE THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE WAS LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER COMING TO INTERRUPT THE WARBLING OF BIRDS UNDER THE LEAFY COVERT OF THE TREES
THE RESULT OF ALL THESE CHANGES THE SOURCE OF WHICH EMANATED FROM THE ROYAL WILL WAS THAT MONSIEUR INSTEAD OF BEING THE SECOND PERSON IN THE KINGDOM HAD IN REALITY BECOME THE THIRD
MANICAMP WAS THE HONESTEST MAN IN THE WORLD APPROPRIATED TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE LITTERING THE TABLE AND WHICH DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO ANY PERSON IN PARTICULAR
HER GLANCE WHICH THE PRESUMPTUOUS DE GUICHE REGARDED AS INTENDED FOR HIMSELF RESTED AS IT SWEPT OVER THE WHOLE CIRCLE UPON LA VALLIERE WHOSE WARM BLUSH AND RESTLESS EMOTION IT INSTANTLY PERCEIVED
HE PUSHED HASTILY THOROUGH THE CROWD OF CURIOUS LOOKERS-ON AND AT THE SIGHT OF THESE UNEXPECTED ERECTIONS UTTERED A CRY OF ANGER AND DISMAY
WHO WAS LISTENING THE KING ADVANCED TOWARDS HER TO TAKE HOLD OF ONE OF HER HANDS
AGAINST YOU ARE ARRAYED THE SILENT SHADES OF BLOIS THE MEETINGS WHEN YOU DILIGENTLY CONNED THE STARS TOGETHER THE EVENING WANDERINGS BENEATH THE PLANTAIN-TREES HIS IMPASSIONED TWENTY YEARS SPEAKING TO YOUR FOURTEEN SUMMERS THE FIRE OF HIS GLANCES ADDRESSED TO YOURSELF YES YES
FOUQUET'S SAID ARAMIS BITING HIS LIPS TO M
EVERYTHING I HAVE TOLD YOU IS ON THE CONTRARY PERFECTLY SERIOUS
ALL WHO WERE YOUNG FLOCKED THERE AND WHEN THE KING HIMSELF HAPPENS TO BE YOUNG EVERYBODY AT COURT IS SO TOO
THIS PERFIDY HAD BEEN CALCULATED WITH EXTREME ABILITY
THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
IN FACT MADAME FOUND DE GUICHE SO HANDSOME AND SO ADMIRABLY DRESSED THAT SHE ALMOST CEASED REGRETTING THE ROYAL CONQUEST SHE FELT SHE WAS ON THE POINT OF ESCAPING HER
RAOUL IS SUFFERING
DE BRAGELONNE SINCE M
THE YOUNG GIRL SEEMED AS THOUGH SMITTEN BY SOME SUPERSTITIOUS FEELING OF TERROR AND TOTTERED
THE NIGHT IS NOW VERY DARK AND THE DARKNESS IS STILL GREATER UNDER THE TREES
WAIT FOR ME HERE CHEVALIER WAIT FOR ME HERE THE PRINCE DISAPPEARED IN THE NEIGHBORING APARTMENT AND INQUIRED OF THE GENTLEMAN IN ATTENDANCE IF THE QUEEN-MOTHER HAD RETURNED FROM CHAPEL
I AM IMPATIENT TO SEE A HAND SO SKILLFUL AS YOURS CONTINUE THE PORTRAIT WHERE VIRGIL LEFT IT AND FINISH IT BEFORE OUR EYES MADAME SAID SAINT-AIGNAN I AM INDEED A POOR DUMB POST BESIDE THE MIGHTY VIRGIL
IF YOU QUARREL WITH THE ONE YOU WILL BE ON BAD TERMS WITH THE OTHER VERY WELL
WAS THERE ANY NECESSITY THEN FOR MADAME TO ATTACH SO GREAT AN IMPORTANCE TO LA VALLIERE IF SHE DID NOT FEAR HER
INDEED SAID MADAME HE SEEMS ALMOST THE ONLY PERSON HERE YOU ARE UNJUST MADAME SAID THE PRINCE
RAOUL WHO LOVED COMPREHENDED IT ALL
THE JOURNEY WILL APPEAR SHORTER IF TOGETHER THAN IF ALONE
IT WAS NECESSARY THEREFORE SIMPLY TO SWALLOW THE AFFRONT IN SILENCE AND TO WEAR HIS USUAL GENTLENESS AND GRACIOUSNESS OF EXPRESSION
LOOK AT THIS AND HE HANDED DE GUICHE THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT AS HIS OWN
IN THAT CASE RETURNED BUCKINGHAM I APPEAL TO MADAME HERSELF AND I MY LORD RETORTED THE ADMIRAL I APPEAL TO MY OWN CONSCIENCE AND TO MY OWN SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
ENJOY
DID NOT THE DANCING AMUSE YOU NO BUT SURELY THE ENCHANTING SPECTACLE NO MORE THAN THE DANCING
HE BEARS NO GRUDGE AGAINST DE WARDES,--HE HAS SAID SO
TO M
YOU ARE VERY WELCOME MY DEAR FRIEND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND NOT FOR THE HAND OF MALICORNE BUT FOR THE PURSE
IT RAINED ALL NIGHT LONG
THE SEQUEL ITSELF WAS NOT THOUGHT OF
VANNES IN BRETAGNE YES THE LITTLE MAN BEGAN TO TEAR HIS HAIR SAYING HOW CAN I GET TO VANNES FROM HERE BY MIDDAY TO-MORROW
I FANCIED I UNDERSTOOD YOUR LOOKS I ROSE AND THEN WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING MORE TOWARDS YOU THAN LOVE YOU YET MORE DEVOTEDLY IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE--YOU A WOMAN WITHOUT HEART FAITH OR LOVE IN VERY WANTONNESS DASHED ME DOWN AGAIN FROM SHEER CAPRICE
PUNISH ME FOR MY AUDACITY DESPISE ME FOR MY SHAMELESS IMMODESTY
I SAW THAT WHEN LA VALLIERE FELL INTO HIS ARMS THE KING ALMOST FAINTED HIMSELF MADAME SMOTHERED A SUBDUED CRY THE ONLY INDICATION OF HER SMOTHERED ANGER
THE FIRST THING THE KING DID WAS TO ANNOUNCE TO MONSIEUR THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUIETLY ARRANGED
IT DOES NOT CONCERN YOU M
THEN AS DE WARDES STOOD DISARMED AND ASTOUNDED AT HIS DEFEAT RAOUL SHEATHED HIS SWORD SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR AND THE WAIST BAND AND HURLED HIS ADVERSARY TO THE OTHER END OF THE BARRIER TREMBLING AND MAD WITH RAGE
BUT YOU USED A PHRASE WHICH HAS A VERY EQUIVOCAL SIGNIFICANCE
WELL MONSIEUR SAID THE YOUNG MAN
CHAPTER XXIX
CHAPTER XXXI
THANK YOU THANK YOU SAID HE TO MANICAMP GRASPING HIS HAND
IT IS ALL THE SAME SHE MURMURED
HE SUMMONED THOSE IN ATTENDANCE ON MADAME BUT EVERYBODY HAD GONE OUT
NO ONE EVER KNEW WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THEM OR RATHER WHAT IT WAS THAT THE QUEEN-MOTHER SAID TO LOUIS XIV
HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SHOW FOUR QUARTERINGS NONSENSE SAID DE GUICHE WHERE COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN THAT DE WARDES ONE EXAMPLE WILL SUFFICE HE RETURNED DIRECTING HIS LOOK FULLY UPON RAOUL
I AM SETTING OUT TO GET IT SIGNED
WILL YOU NOT FORGIVE ME THEN FOR SPEAKING TO YOU WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE FRANKNESS OF A CHILD SPEAK MONSIEUR RAOUL SAID LOUISE TREMBLING PAINFULLY I AM LISTENING I CANNOT PART FROM YOU CARRYING AWAY WITH ME A THOUGHT THAT TORTURES ME
IS THAT POSSIBLE MALICORNE IS THERE
LA VALLIERE MONTALAIS AND MYSELF AND YOU INDIVIDUALLY SPOKE IN A LIGHT MANNER OF THE KING I AM AFRAID SO
THE KING AT THIS MOMENT TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING ROUND HIM AT MORE LEISURE
HAPPY AS A PRINCE
YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON IN THIS KINGDOM NOT ONLY BY YOUR RANK BUT THE FIRST PERSON IN THE WORLD ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR ANGELIC ATTRIBUTES
THEREFORE WHENEVER NOW AND THEN DESPITE HIS COMMAND OVER HIMSELF HE WAS LOST IN THOUGHT DE WARDES LEFT HIM ENTIRELY TO HIS MUSINGS
I WOULD PRECIPITATE MYSELF FROM THE TOP OF THE BALCONY RATHER THAN TOUCH THE HEM OF YOUR ROBE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUIS AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
THE BARGE WAS CARPETED WITH VELVET AND DECORATED WITH COVERINGS EMBROIDERED WITH THE ARMS OF ENGLAND AND WITH GARLANDS OF FLOWERS
AND I AM AS DETERMINED AS MY FRIEND MANICAMP WAS JUST NOW NOT TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE OPEN AIR WHAT IS TO BE DONE THEN SAID MONTALAIS
YOU ALWAYS WIN I WILL WAGER THEM THEN AGAINST WHAT AGAINST TWENTY OTHERS AND WHAT SHALL BE THE OBJECT OF THE WAGER THIS
FOUQUET'S CERTAINLY THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT DEAR M
THE ADMIRAL HOWEVER WITHOUT TAKING ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF THE DUKE'S ILL-HUMOR LED THE PRINCESSES INTO THE QUARTER-DECK CABIN WHERE DINNER HAD BEEN SERVED WITH A MAGNIFICENCE WORTHY IN EVERY RESPECT OF HIS GUESTS
10 LOUIS ATTENDED MASS AS USUAL BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS ATTENTION WAS SOMEWHAT DISTRACTED FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE CREATOR BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE CREATURE
THIS SHELTERED RETREAT COVERED WITH NASTURTIUMS AND CLIMBING ROSES SCREENED THE BENCH SO THAT THE SPECTATORS INSULATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWN SAW AND WERE SEEN ON EVERY SIDE BUT COULD NOT BE HEARD WITHOUT PERCEIVING THOSE WHO MIGHT APPROACH FOR THE PURPOSE OF LISTENING
CHAPTER XXX
WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES
ARE YOU LISTENING I AM LISTENING
I AM PARTICULARLY SURPRISED THAT ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT HAVE INFORMED OURSELVES ACCURATELY ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE SILLY ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE MATTER FOR OUR OWN HEARTS TO DECIDE THE HEART SIRE IS AN ORGAN WHICH REQUIRES POSITIVELY TO BE REDUCED TO ITS MATERIAL FUNCTIONS BUT WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY'S PEACE OF MIND SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF ALL ITS METAPHYSICAL INCLINATIONS
FRANKNESS AS WELL AS EVERY OTHER
YOU WILL BE GETTING THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
SINCE YESTERDAY HE HAS LEFT OFF BEING JEALOUS BAH
IS THAT ALL YOU WISHED TO ASK ME ADDED LOUIS XIV
NAY DO NOT DENY IT FOR I AM SURE OF IT
I REQUIRE MEN ABOUT ME WHO ARE UNFETTERED
OH REPLIED MONTALAIS TEMPER SORROW TEARS
HERE WE ARE SAID TONNAY-CHARENTE
BUT I DO KNOW FOR MY PART AT LEAST THAT THERE HAS BEEN GREAT IMPRUDENCE COMMITTED
COLBERT IS APPROACHING
IT WAS EASY TO GUESS THAT THE QUEEN WAS COMPLAINING BITTERLY AND THAT IF ANNE OF AUSTRIA DID NOT CONSOLE HER SHE AT LEAST ENDEAVORED TO DO SO
NOT WHEN I AM A WITNESS OF THINGS THAT ARE ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD STAY STAY SAID DE WARDES
THE SWORDS SEEMED TO SEEK EACH OTHER GUESSED THEIR POSITION AND MET
MONSIEUR WHO NO LONGER RETAINED THE SLIGHTEST FEELING OF JEALOUSY AND WHO BESIDES PERMITTED HIMSELF TO BE MONOPOLIZED BY THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE ALLOWED AS MUCH LIBERTY AND FREEDOM IN HIS HOUSE AS THE MOST EXACTING COULD DESIRE
BESIDES HE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION THE FUTURE OF EUROPE IS NO LONGER IN THE HANDS OF THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND WITH A PENCIL HE HELD IN HIS HAND HE STRUCK THE BARON DE WOSTPUR'S NAME FROM THE LIST
AND SO SHE SAID INTERROGATIVELY BREAKING THE SILENCE
THAT THE ENGLISH SHOULD RENDER HOMAGE TO THE BEAUTY OF OUR QUEENS AND OUR PRINCESSES FORGIVE ME BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT HAS PASSED
D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED BUCKINGHAM IS THE BRAVEST GENTLEMAN I KNOW
HE IS BISHOP OF VANNES WHAT
I SAW A SIMILAR ONE ON THE SPOT D'ARTAGNAN'S BROW BECAME CLOUDED
BUCKINGHAM WAS CONVERSING WITH FOUQUET WHO WAS TALKING WITH HIM ALOUD ABOUT BELLE-ISLE
A PHYSICIAN WHO HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF OUR HOLY ORDER WOULD HAVE LEFT ME IN IGNORANCE OF MY CONDITION
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER ILL-NATURED ACTION HE WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM LA VALLIERE
GRISART HESITATED WHETHER HE SHOULD GIVE HIM IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE OR SHOULD RUN TO PREPARE THE CORDIAL HE HAD PROMISED
SIRE SHE EXCLAIMED DO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MY LOYALTY FOR THIS WOULD SHOW ME THAT YOUR MAJESTY DESPISES ME STILL MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE SAID THE KING SUDDENLY DRAWING BACK WITH AN AIR FULL OF RESPECT THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THAT I LOVE AND HONOR MORE THAN YOURSELF AND NOTHING IN MY COURT I CALL HEAVEN TO WITNESS SHALL BE SO HIGHLY REGARDED AS YOU SHALL BE HENCEFORWARD
THE HEAT IS VERY OPPRESSIVE AND I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO BATHE TOO HE SUMMONED HIS SERVANTS BUT NO ONE CAME
MADAME COVETED COMPLIMENTARY REMARKS AND DETERMINED TO PROCURE THEM AT ANY COST SHE ADDRESSED HERSELF TO THE KING SAYING
AFTER A SILENCE LONG ENOUGH TO ENABLE THE CHEVALIER TO JUDGE THE EFFECT OF THIS ORATORICAL DISPLAY THE DUKE AROSE SAYING COME BE CANDID AS I ALWAYS AM VERY WELL
ANNE EXPERIENCED ALMOST A FEELING OF PRIDE WHENEVER SHE SAW ANY ONE ENTER HER APARTMENT WITH WOE-BEGONE LOOKS PALE CHEEKS OR RED EYES GATHERING FROM APPEARANCES THAT ASSISTANCE WAS REQUIRED EITHER BY THE WEAKEST OR THE MOST REBELLIOUS
BUT I SHOULD SAY OF THE SHEPHERDS OF THE WHOLE WORLD THE KING FORGOT HIS PART OF A PASSIVE AUDITOR AND BOWED
EVERYTHING MUST BE EXHAUSTED
FOLLY NO NO NO
DE GUICHE LED RAOUL TO AN ADJOINING CABINET AND MADE HIM SIT DOWN SAYING HOW WELL YOU LOOK THAT IS SINGULAR REPLIED RAOUL FOR I AM FAR FROM BEING IN GOOD SPIRITS IT IS YOUR CASE THEN RAOUL AS IT IS MY OWN,--OUR LOVE AFFAIRS DO NOT PROGRESS SO MUCH THE BETTER COUNT AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED
AND HE RELATED TO MANICAMP TALES THAT MADE HIM READY TO DIE WITH LAUGHING WHICH THE LATTER OUT OF IDLENESS TOOK READY-MADE TO M
WE KNOW THESE AIRS VERY WELL VICOMTE
NOW TELL ME WHOM HAVE THE TWO LOVERS SELECTED TO SERVE AS THEIR SCREEN LA VALLIERE OH OH POOR GIRL
THE FOREHAND IS LIGHT
MY REMAINING STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED MY LATEST-FORMED RESOLUTIONS HAVE VANISHED AND I ABANDON MYSELF TO MY FATE
A PILOT-BOAT HOWEVER NOTWITHSTANDING THE WIND AND THE SEA WAS GETTING READY TO LEAVE THE HARBOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLACING ITSELF AT THE ADMIRAL'S DISPOSAL
GUARDED IN THIS MANNER BY THE COMPANIONS WHO HAD SHARED HER ADVENTURE LA VALLIERE WHETHER FROM REGRET AT RAOUL'S DEPARTURE OR STILL SUFFERING FROM THE EMOTION CAUSED BY RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD BEGUN TO RENDER HER NAME FAMILIAR ON THE LIPS OF THE COURTIERS LA VALLIERE WE REPEAT HID HER EYES RED WITH WEEPING BEHIND HER FAN AND SEEMED TO GIVE THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO THE REMARKS WHICH MONTALAIS AND ATHENAIS ALTERNATELY WHISPERED TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME
I CAN EASILY DISPOSE OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WORTH TO MONSIEUR
WITHOUT APPLAUSE HE DANCED INDIFFERENTLY AND VERY SOON COULD NOT DANCE AT ALL BY WHICH ACCIDENT THE TRIUMPH OF THE KING AND OF MADAME WAS ASSURED
BY THE LIGHT WHICH FILTERED THROUGH THE IRON-BARRED WINDOW COULD BE SEEN A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN SHORT IN STATURE WITH CLOSELY CUT HAIR AND A BEARD BEGINNING TO GROW
THE VICTIM HOWEVER OF ALL THESE ROYAL AFFECTIONS AND AFFECTATIONS WAS POOR DE GUICHE
AS MANY AS YOU PLEASE ARE THEY FRIENDS YES MONSIEUR REAL FRIENDS NO DOUBT OF IT VERY WELL GET A GOOD SUPPLY THEN
MY AMBITION IS NOT NEARLY SO EXALTED DE WARDES HAD A MORE PENETRATING OBSERVATION THAN DE GUICHE AND FATHOMED MALICORNE IMMEDIATELY
IT WAS NOT MONTALAIS
DE WARDES CONCLUDED BUCKINGHAM AS HE SALUTED HIM
A JESUIT OF THE ELEVENTH YEAR
DE GUICHE IS NOT WICKEDLY DISPOSED MADAME
UNHAPPY GIRL
HE WAS CONVERSING WITH MONSIEUR AND THE DUC DE ROQUELAURE MONSIEUR ON HIS RIGHT AND THE DUC DE ROQUELAURE ON HIS LEFT
THE KING'S LOVE FOR MADAME THAT OF MADAME FOR THE KING THAT OF GUICHE FOR MADAME THAT OF LA VALLIERE FOR THE KING THAT OF MALICORNE FOR MONTALAIS THAT OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE FOR HIMSELF WAS NOT ALL THIS TRULY MORE THAN ENOUGH TO TURN THE HEAD OF ANY COURTIER
BECAUSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SERIOUS
IT IS REALLY TIME YOU SHOULD
MALICORNE BOWED MODESTLY
YES MONSIEUR SAID MALICORNE SMILING IN HIS TURN
IT IS A SUBJECT OF REMARK THAT QUARRELSOME AND RESTLESS CHARACTERS INVARIABLY SEEK THE COMPANIONSHIP OF GENTLE TIMOROUS DISPOSITIONS AS IF THE FORMER SOUGHT IN THE CONTRAST A REPOSE FOR THEIR OWN ILL-HUMOR AND THE LATTER A PROTECTION FOR THEIR WEAKNESS
AFTER THE PRINCESS HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND HAD RESTED THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD FORMED THEIR ESCORT HAVING IN LIKE MANNER RECOVERED FROM THEIR FATIGUE THEY RESUMED THEIR ACCUSTOMED HABITS AND OCCUPATIONS
I HAVE IT BEFORE MY EYES
THE DESIGNS THE CHASINGS--ALL NEW PATTERNS WHAT PROPORTION OF THE COST DOES THE WORKMANSHIP FORM
DE BRAGELONNE PROBABLY THINKS THE POSITION IS ABOVE MY CONDITION SAID LOUISE HESITATINGLY
BRAGELONNE WHO IS AS COURAGEOUS AS CAESAR AND AS CLEVER AND WITTY AS M
THEN SPEAK MY FRIEND
GOOD GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED MONTALAIS WHO IS THAT SPEAKING TO ME MALICORNE MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS AND AS MALICORNE SPOKE HE RAISED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUND TO THE LOWEST BRANCHES AND THENCE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE WALL
UPON THE QUARTER-DECK OF THE FLAGSHIP SHELTERED BY A CANOPY OF VELVET AND ERMINE WHICH WAS SUSPENDED BY STOUT SUPPORTS HENRIETTE THE QUEEN DOWAGER AND THE YOUNG PRINCESS--WITH THE ADMIRAL THE DUKE OF NORFOLK STANDING BESIDE THEM--WATCHED WITH ALARM THIS SLENDER BARK AT ONE MOMENT TOSSED TO THE HEAVENS AND THE NEXT BURIED BENEATH THE WAVES AND AGAINST WHOSE DARK SAIL THE NOBLE FIGURES OF THE TWO FRENCH GENTLEMEN STOOD FORTH IN RELIEF LIKE TWO LUMINOUS APPARITIONS
I HAVE HEARD OF MANY OF THESE SORTS OF PROMISES BEFOREHAND WHICH OFTEN LEAD PEOPLE TO FLATTER THEMSELVES WITH WILD HOPES AND AT THE LAST MOMENT WHEN THE TIME COMES TO KEEP THE PROMISES AND HAVE THE HOPES REALIZED THEY ARE SURPRISED TO SEE THE GREAT CREDIT UPON WHICH THEY RECKONED VANISH LIKE SMOKE OH
MAY ONE VENTURE TO ASK YOU MONSIEUR ON WHAT YOU HAVE REFLECTED I FELT THAT AS I HAD COMMITTED NO CRIME HEAVEN COULD NOT PUNISH ME WHAT IS A PRISON THEN INQUIRED ARAMIS IF IT BE NOT A PUNISHMENT ALAS
AFTER DINNER YOU WILL GO TO YOUR OWN APARTMENTS AND DRESS YOURSELF AND THEN YOU WILL COME TO FETCH ME
AND DE GUICHE OR MANICAMP WILL HAVE ARGUED IN THIS MANNER
THE PEOPLE COULD STILL LOOK BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO SING
THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS STAYING IN THIS HOTEL CONTINUED THE FRANCISCAN
I WISH EVERYTHING TO BE SETTLED THIS EVENING
WE WILL TAKE LEAVE OF EACH OTHER TO-NIGHT
WHILE LA VALLIERE AND THE KING WERE MINGLING IN THEIR FIRST CONFESSION OF LOVE ALL THE BITTERNESS OF THE PAST THE HAPPINESS OF THE PRESENT AND HOPES OF THE FUTURE FOUQUET HAD RETIRED TO THE APARTMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO HIM IN THE CHATEAU AND WAS CONVERSING WITH ARAMIS PRECISELY UPON THE VERY SUBJECTS WHICH THE KING AT THAT MOMENT WAS FORGETTING
MALICORNE STOOD UP BRUSHED HIS HAT WITH HIS SLEEVE SMOOTHED DOWN HIS BLACK DOUBLET;--MONTALAIS THOUGH PRETENDING TO READ LOOKED AT HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE
GOOD SAID MALICORNE PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR SIX WEEKS
I SAID LA VALLIERE SMILING I AM A COUNTRY GIRL ACCUSTOMED TO ROAMING THROUGH THE MEADOWS OF THE LOIRE AND THE GARDENS OF BLOIS WHATEVER THE WEATHER MAY BE
HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED THAT M
THE MARQUISE DIVINED IN A SINGLE GLACE THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF THE UNHAPPINESS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT
THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM SHE MURMURED
A SLIGHT MURMUR WAS HEARD FROM THOSE PRESENT
I HAVE NOT SEEN A PEN IN EITHER OF THEIR HANDS FOR THE LAST WEEK ON WHAT TERMS ARE YOU WITH MADAME THE VERY BEST AND WITH THE KING THE KING ALWAYS SMILES AT ME WHENEVER I PASS HIM GOOD
THE ONE LOVES NEARLY ALWAYS BEFORE THE OTHER IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE LATTER FINISHES NEARLY ALWAYS BY LOVING AFTER THE OTHER
ADIEU MADEMOISELLE ACCEPT MY VERY HUMBLE SALUTATION AND HE MADE THREE STEPS TOWARDS THE DOOR
FOR IF YOU LIVE MY LORD YOU WILL MAKE OF ME NOW YOU KNOW ME WHAT I CAN AND OUGHT TO BE AND AS I AM DYING EXCLAIMED THE FRANCISCAN I CONSTITUTE YOU MY SUCCESSOR
GO THE JESUIT LEFT THE ROOM
OF BUCKINGHAM SHE TOOK BUT LITTLE NOTICE
MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED DE GUICHE SHOW A LITTLE CHARITY TOWARDS SUCH A MISERABLE FELLOW AS I AM
AND I FIND YOU SEEMINGLY MOON-STRUCK
ARE YOU NOT IN FAVOR WITH THE NEW KING PERFECTLY SO MADAME FOR HIS MAJESTY'S KINDNESS TO ME IS UNBOUNDED IT CANNOT SAID THE QUEEN BE BECAUSE YOUR FORTUNE HAS DIMINISHED FOR IT IS SAID TO BE ENORMOUS MY INCOME MADAME HAS NEVER BEEN SO LARGE THERE IS SOME SECRET CAUSE THEN NO MADAME SAID BUCKINGHAM EAGERLY THERE IS NOTHING SECRET IN MY REASON FOR THIS DETERMINATION
LA VALLIERE HAD ABOUT HER NOT EXACTLY A COURT BUT SPRINKLINGS OF COURTIERS
HAVE I NOT SAID THAT I ADMIT HE POSSESSES A CERTAIN SUPERIORITY AND WOULD NOT THAT BE ENOUGH
TOWARDS ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING A SHIP WITH SAILS FULL SET WAS SIGNALLED AS IN VIEW
NOTHING CAN BE MORE INTERESTING AT THIS POINT MADAME LIKE A VIGILANT GENERAL INSPECTING HIS ARMY GLANCED AT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHO COULD NOT HELP WINCING AS THEY DREW THEMSELVES UP
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DOWRY FOR HER AND SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO MARRY WITHOUT HER TROUSSEAU AS WILL PROBABLY BE THE CASE REALLY ANSWERED THE QUEEN-MOTHER POOR LITTLE THING
AND YOU GENTLEMEN NOR I
AND SO ACCORDING TO YOUR OPINION M
VERY WELL YES SIRE AND M
YOU HAVE SOME SERIOUS CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST MADAME I DO NOT PRECISELY SAY IT IS SERIOUS IN THAT CASE THEN THROW ASIDE YOUR DOLEFUL LOOKS
AH SHE SAID GNASHING HER TEETH IT WAS INDEED A LETTER FROM M
HOW MUCH GREATER REASON THEN SUCH A POSITION AS THIS
AND SHE RAOUL--AT LEAST I THOUGHT I REMARKED IT--SHE LOOKED AT ME IF NOT WITH PITY AT LEAST WITH GENTLENESS
EVERY ONE OF THEM THEIR SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES WAS READY TO OBEY THE SLIGHTEST SIGN EITHER OF DE GUICHE OR BRAGELONNE THE LEADERS OF THE EMBASSY
WE SET OFF FOR LE HAVRE I PRESUME THIS IS ADMIRABLE--DELIGHTFUL
MADAME WAS CONVERSING WITH MADEMOISELLE DE CHATILLON AND MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY WHO WERE NEXT TO HER AND ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO MONSIEUR WHO DREW ASIDE AS SOON AS THE KING WAS ANNOUNCED
WHILE I AM SOLICITING A FAVOR YOU DO ME ALL THE MISCHIEF YOU CAN FORGIVE ME COMTE SAID THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE SOMEWHAT UNEASY AT THE TONE IN WHICH GUICHE HAD MADE HIS REMARK BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF DOING SO AND I BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I HAVE MISTAKEN ONE YOUNG LADY FOR ANOTHER THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT MONSIEUR
COLBERT THE PLAN I HAVE ADOPTED IS ONE WORTHY OF A KING SAID LOUIS XIV WHO PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH ALL THE MAJESTY HE KNEW HOW TO ASSUME IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
DE MONTESPAN
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FANCYING HERSELF TO BE ALONE WITH HER TWO FRIENDS REVEALED TO THEM HER AFFECTION FOR THE KING AH SAID MADAME BEGINNING TO BE UNEASY HER AFFECTION FOR THE KING YES WHEN WAS THIS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO MADAME STARTED AND THEN SAID AND NO ONE KNEW OF THIS AFFECTION NO ONE NOT EVEN HIS MAJESTY NOT EVEN HIS MAJESTY
DE SAINT-AIGNAN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN
AND WHY SHOULD I MY DEAR AURE REPLIED THE GIRL IN A VOICE SOFT AS A FLUTE
AND SALUTED ACCORDING TO THEIR RANK AND THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE HIM THE ADMIRAL AND SEVERAL OF THE ENGLISH NOBLEMEN WHO WERE GROUPED AROUND THE PRINCESS
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE IS FAR TOO BEAUTIFUL TO SERVE AS A CLOAK A KING'S CLOAK SAID MADAME HENRIETTA SMILING OUGHT TO BE BEAUTIFUL DO YOU ADVISE ME TO DO IT THEN INQUIRED LOUIS
AND FIXING A LOOK FULL OF ANGER UPON SAINT-AIGNAN SUDDENLY CRIED OUT
REALLY YOU OVERWHELM ME SHE SAID
BUT WE WHOSE MISSION IT IS TO INTERPRET ALL THINGS AS IT IS ALSO TO COMMUNICATE OUR INTERPRETATIONS TO OUR READERS,--WE SHOULD FAIL IN OUR DUTY IF WE WERE TO LEAVE THEM IN IGNORANCE OF THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW
IF I GIVE YOU FACTS HE SAID WILL YOU BELIEVE ME IF IT REGARDED ANYTHING ELSE BUT JEALOUSY I WOULD BELIEVE YOU WITHOUT YOUR BRINGING FACTS FORWARD
I KNOW ONE SAID FOUQUET SMILING NOT TEN PACES FROM HERE THEN LOOKING ROUND HIM HE ADDED
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS IS EXCEEDINGLY AMIABLE HE SAID
THE RUMOR NOW SPREAD THAT THE PRINCESS WAS ARRIVING
BUT I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO USE EVEN THOSE BELONGING TO M
I HAVE HIRED ALL THE HOUSES WHICH SURROUND THE HOTEL DE VILLE WHERE I HAVE BUSINESS TO TRANSACT
FOUQUET IMMEDIATELY QUITTED HIS PLACE
I AM OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND I DO NOT RANK MYSELF ABOVE MY POSITION M
THE CONVERSATION TERMINATED THERE ALTHOUGH DE GUICHE TRIED HIS UTMOST TO DRAW OUT HIS SECRET FROM HIM
WE MUST LOSE NO TIME SAID THE FRANCISCAN
THEIR NAMES SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WHO HESITATED FROM FEAR OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION
NEAR THE SONGSTER IN THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THE LARGE TREES COULD BE SEEN THE GLISTENING EYES OF AN OWL ATTRACTED BY THE HARMONY
I THINK HE IS LOOKING AT YOU
IS IT NOT YOUR OPINION TOO SAID THE KING
THE RESULT WAS THAT I GAVE SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS TO TREMBLAY AS HIS SHARE VERY AGREEABLE THAT
DE LA FERE WILL LEAVE SOMETHING LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR TO HIS SON
THE VEIL WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER THE SKY AS IF DRIVEN BY A BLAST OF HEATED AIR HAD BECOME MASSED TOGETHER IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE HEAVENS
D'ARTAGNAN
D'ARTAGNAN
D'ARTAGNAN
DE GUICHE TO RETURN YOU THE THANKS I HAD PROPOSED TO OFFER YOU ON THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY
DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE HOW OUR FEET ARE SINKING INTO THE SAND I HAVE SUNK UP TO THE ANKLES SAID BUCKINGHAM WITHOUT RECKONING THAT THE WATER IS EVEN NOW BREAKING IN UPON US IT HAS ALREADY REACHED ME
FOUQUET INTERROGATED HER WITH HIS MOST SEARCHING GAZE AS HE HAD ALREADY DONE BEFORE BUT THE SAME INGENIOUS EXPRESSIONS THE SAME TRANSPARENTLY CANDID LOOK MET HIS
AND YOUR CASH-BOX TOO SAID THE KING LAUGHING WITH A FALSE SMILE
WHO CAN TELL WHETHER THAT HEART SO COVETED IS NOT COMMON IN ITS IMPULSES AND FULL OF ALLOY
AND THIS BECAUSE MERELY OF THE FORTNIGHT'S SOJOURN IN THE COUNTRY SHE IMPOSED ON YOU MONSEIGNEUR A FORTNIGHT IS A FORTNIGHT
MALICORNE TO HAVE INTENTIONS TOWARDS ME IF HIS INTENTIONS ARE HONORABLE HONORABLE INTENTIONS WITH SUCH A FACE CRIED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY
ARAMIS LOOKED MOST NARROWLY NOT ONLY AT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE OPEN SPACE STRETCHING OUT BEFORE AND BEHIND HIM BUT EVEN INTO THE VERY DEPTH OF THE WOOD
HE HAD NOT NOTICED MONSIEUR APPROACH
I POSTED FROM ORLEANS AND I CHANGED MY TRAVELING SUIT FOR THE ONE I HAVE ON IN ORDER TO PRESENT MYSELF TO YOU TRUE YOU ALREADY TOLD ME YOU HAD COME FROM ORLEANS SAYING WHICH HE CRUMPLED MANICAMP'S LETTER IN HIS HAND AND THRUST IT IN HIS POCKET
IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE SAID WHO WAS CONCEALED THERE
IF HE BE AS UGLY AS HIS NAME I RETRACT EVERY WORD I HAVE SAID YOUR HIGHNESS KNOWS HIM FOR YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN HIM AT THE PALAIS ROYAL
HE ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARDS THE KING FORGETTING THAT THE KING IS NEVER SPOKEN TO EXCEPT IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS ADDRESSED
ARAMIS DURING THE INTERVIEW WALKED IMPATIENTLY BUT WITHOUT A SYLLABLE UP AND DOWN THE CABINET
HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE YOU FOR THAT THE SECRET WHICH I NOW DISPOSE OF TO YOU MONSIEUR AND WHICH I BUY FOR A HUNDRED PISTOLES
FLY THE THREE GIRLS IN THE EXTREMITY OF TERROR FLED BY THE FIRST PATH THAT PRESENTED ITSELF AND DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED THE VERGE OF THE WOOD
VERY WELL THEN SAID MALICORNE
I HAVE A MULTITUDE OF THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS YOU HEAR SAID THE COMTE LAUGHING
PARDON ME YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SIGN AH
DE MONTESPAN DID NOT CONTINUE TO LOVE HER
TWELVE YEARS OF EXTREME SEVERITY HOW CAN THAT BE SINCE TWELVE YEARS AGO I WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS OLD
BUCKINGHAM TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT THE TALL THIN FIGURE AND THE LISTLESS EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE OF HIS QUESTIONER
AND WHAT CREDIT CAN THE POOR CLERK OF A PROCURER HAVE PRAY YOUR FATHER HAS NOT TWENTY THOUSAND LIVRES A YEAR FOR NOTHING M
THERE IS NO TIME LOST,--YOU WILL REJOICE WHEN I AM GONE GO THEN
MALICORNE WENT GRUMBLING TOWARDS MADAME DE SAINT-REMY WHILST MONTALAIS SAID TO HER FRIEND THROWING ONE ARM AROUND HER NECK WHAT IS THE MATTER
THE FRIVOLITY OF THE CHILD CANNOT SURELY BE PLACED TO THE YOUNG GIRL'S ACCOUNT WELL
AND I WISH TO RETURN TO MY OWN FAMILY MADAME MADAME EXCLAIMED THE KING AS HE APPROACHED HER
BUT I DID NOT EXPECT FOUR MILLIONS NO DOUBT THE AMOUNT IS SERIOUS BUT AFTER ALL FOUR MILLIONS ARE NOT QUITE THE DEATH OF A MAN ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MAN IN QUESTION IS MONSIEUR FOUQUET MY DEAR D'HERBLAY IF YOU KNEW THE CONTENTS OF MY COFFERS YOU WOULD BE LESS EASY AND YOU PROMISED WHAT COULD I DO THAT'S TRUE THE VERY DAY I REFUSE COLBERT WILL PROCURE THE MONEY
HE BENT HIS KNEE BEFORE HER AND TENDERLY KISSED HER HAND
NO IT REALLY IS VERY SINGULAR SHE CONTINUED IN A COMPASSIONATE TONE HOW EXILE HAS AFFECTED POOR M
FOUQUET YES MADAME AND YOU LIMITED YOURSELF TO THAT AND WHAT I AM NOW DOING IS THE ACT OF A FRIEND NO DOUBT IT IS AND YOU REJECT THIS MARK OF MY FRIENDSHIP I DO REJECT IT MONSIEUR FOUQUET LOOK AT ME SAID THE MARQUISE WITH GLISTENING EYES I NOW OFFER YOU MY LOVE OH MADAME EXCLAIMED FOUQUET
SIRE SHE SAID I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO DISPLEASE YOU FOR SO LONG A PERIOD THAT I HAVE ALMOST THE RIGHT TO ASK MYSELF TO-DAY WHY YOU WERE ABLE TO ACCEPT ME AS A SISTER-IN-LAW DISPLEASE ME
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT MY DEAR GOVERNOR
THE DOOR WAS THROWN HURRIEDLY OPEN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT APPEARED PALE AGITATED ANXIOUS
DO YOU THINK SO MY LORD IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING SO IT IS THE SECOND TIME YOU HAVE VAUNTED THE ATTRACTIONS OF ENGLAND AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DELIGHT WHICH ALL EXPERIENCE WHO LIVE IN FRANCE ANNE OF AUSTRIA APPROACHED THE YOUNG MAN AND PLACING HER BEAUTIFUL HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER WHICH TREMBLED AT THE TOUCH SAID BELIEVE ME MONSIEUR NOTHING CAN EQUAL A RESIDENCE IN ONE'S OWN NATIVE COUNTRY
IS IT NOT LOUISE COME SAID LA VALLIERE THESE GENTLEMEN HAVE PASSED
DO NOT FORGET THAT I ONLY GO TO OBLIGE YOU SAID THE PRELATE
WHAT DID YOU SEE?--TELL ME--SPEAK I SAW WHAT TEN OTHER PEOPLE SAW AT THE SAME TIME AS MYSELF
CONSIDERING ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF YOUR CASE I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOUR CONDITION IS ALMOST DESPERATE THE FRANCISCAN SMILED IN A STRANGE MANNER
AND THEN SAID TO HIS VALET LET HIM WAIT IT IS A GENTLEMAN FROM BLOIS SAID THE VALET
YOU ARE RIGHT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING AND HE BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
HUSH SAID BAISEMEAUX
SHE WILL BE WEEPING IN HER PLATE AND HERE EYES WILL GET QUITE RED
MANICAMP IF YOU COULD BUT FIND ME A PRETEXT A GOOD PRETEXT A PRETEXT
WHICH MEANS MONSIEUR REPLIED DE GUICHE NOW RATHER PALE THAT I CAUSED THESE TENTS TO BE RAISED AS HABITATIONS FOR MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS AS A SHELTER FOR THE AMBASSADORS OF FRANCE AS THE ONLY PLACE OF REFUGE WHICH YOUR EXACTIONS HAVE LEFT US IN THE TOWN
BY THE BY HAS MADAME DISPLAYED ANY ILL-FEELING AGAINST THIS POOR GIRL NONE SIRE MADAME DID NOT GET ANGRY THEN I DO NOT KNOW
DO YOU NOW WISH TO SEND THE KING AWAY FROM FONTAINEBLEAU I DO NOT PRETEND TO ANYTHING OF THE KIND MADAME SAID MONSIEUR BITTERLY
CHAPTER X
SHE POSSESSED THE MOST MAGNIFICENT JEWELS IN FRANCE AND ESPECIALLY PEARLS OF A SIZE SO LARGE THAT THEY MADE THE KING SIGH EVERY TIME HE SAW THEM BECAUSE THE PEARLS OF HIS CROWN WERE LIKE MILLET SEED COMPARED TO THEM
SHE KNEW LOUIS WAS HESITATING IF NOT IN DOUBT AND THAT HIS INDOLENT OR TIMID HEART REQUIRED AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT
IN ONE WORD I AM WEARY OF PARIS WHEREVER AND WHENEVER YOU ARE NOT WITH ME
WHO SAYS THAT YOUR DEVOTION WILL NOT BE REMEMBERED
MALICORNE M
COLBERT AH
YOU ARE RIGHT MADAME HE SAID BUT THOSE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK HAD RECEIVED THEIR ORDER OF EXILE FROM THE LIPS OF THE ONE WHOM THEY LOVED
MANICAMP YOU WOULD CONSUME THEM IN POST-HORSES ALONE NO NO MAKE YOURSELF EASY ON THAT SCORE PARDON ME
WHEREUPON THE PRINCE SIGNED
SUCH A SPECTACLE INDEED WELL MERITED ADMIRATION
WELL SIRE
WHILST YOU ON THE CONTRARY ARE DESCENDED FROM A RACE WHOSE PASSIONS ARE SUSPECTED BY ALL TRUE FRENCHMEN
THE VIOLENCE OF HIS DISORDER HOWEVER OVERCAME HIS COURAGE
THE TORCHES WERE REFLECTED IN THE CHANNEL WHICH THE RISING TIDE WAS GRADUALLY FILLING WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JETTY MIGHT BE NOTICED GROUPS OF CURIOUS LOOKERS-ON CONSISTING OF SAILORS AND TOWNSPEOPLE WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO MISS NOTHING OF THE SPECTACLE
AND FOR MY OWN PART I KNOW ONE THING WHAT IS THAT THAT I SHALL QUIETLY TELL RAOUL OF THE TRICK HUSH SAID MONTALAIS MOUNTING ANOTHER ROUND OF THE LADDER SO AS TO APPROACH MALICORNE MORE CLOSELY DO NOT OPEN YOUR LIPS TO POOR RAOUL WHY NOT BECAUSE AS YET YOU KNOW NOTHING AT ALL WHAT IS THE MATTER THEN WHY THIS EVENING--BUT NO ONE IS LISTENING I HOPE NO THIS EVENING THEN BENEATH THE ROYAL OAK LA VALLIERE SAID ALOUD AND INNOCENTLY ENOUGH I CANNOT CONCEIVE THAT WHEN ONE HAS ONCE SEEN THE KING ONE CAN EVER LOVE ANOTHER MAN MALICORNE ALMOST JUMPED OFF THE WALL
BUT MADAME WAS DETERMINED TO TURN THE KNIFE IN THE WOUND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
AND THEY CONDESCENDED TO FORGET THEY WERE QUEENS IN RECOLLECTING THAT THEY WERE WOMEN
CHAPTER XLVIII
DE SAINT-REMY I THINK STEWARD OF THE DOWAGER MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD YOUR MAJESTY IS CORRECTLY INFORMED MORE THAN THAT THE YOUNG LADY HAS LATELY BECOME ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S MAIDS OF HONOR YOUR MAJESTY IS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER HISTORY THAN AM I THE KING AGAIN REFLECTED AND GLANCING AT THE COMTE'S ANXIOUS COUNTENANCE SAID
FOR HE SAW THE OBJECT DE WARDES HAD IN VIEW
I DID NOT PRETEND TO HAVE A COLD AS MADAME DID WHICH SHE HAS NO MORE THAN I HAVE
WE MUST CALCULATE THE RESULT OF THE BLOW AND WARD IT OFF IF POSSIBLE AFTER ALL SAID FOUQUET THE EVIL IS NOT GREAT YOU THINK SO SAID ARAMIS
EXCELLENT SAID DE GUICHE
AND HIS MAJESTY HAS ENTIRELY ABANDONED HIMSELF TO HIS NEW CAPRICE
LA VALLIERE TERROR-STRICKEN AT THE KING'S IRRITATED ASPECT ROSE A SECOND TIME AND ASSUMING A POSTURE FULL OF HUMILITY AND ENTREATY MURMURED FORGIVE ME SIRE WHAT NEED IS THERE FOR MY FORGIVENESS ASKED LOUIS
EVERY ONE HAD FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE WHICH THE QUEEN AND MADAME HAD SET DOING JUST AS THEY PLEASED ACCORDING AS CHANCE OR FANCY INFLUENCED THEM
AND AS FOR SPENDING THE NIGHT UPON THIS BRANCH I POSSIBLY MIGHT NOT OBJECT TO DO SO BUT I DECLARE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY OTHER ANIMAL THAN A BOA-CONSTRICTOR TO DO IT BUT M
MANICAMP YOU WHO ARE SO ABLE A POLITICIAN AND MAKE M
DE GUICHE WHO APPEARED NOT TO NOTICE THE FOREBODING EXPRESSION WENT UP TO RAOUL AND GRASPING HIM BY THE HAND SAID,--"IT IS AGREED THEN BRAGELONNE IS IT NOT THAT YOU WILL REJOIN US IN THE COURTYARD OF THE PALAIS ROYAL HE THEN SIGNED TO DE WARDES TO FOLLOW HIM WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN BALANCING HIMSELF FIRST ON ONE FOOT THEN ON THE OTHER
WHY YOU ARE BOTH MAD HOW DO YOU DO MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS INQUIRED MALICORNE
THESE ARE THE THINGS TO WHICH HUSBANDS CLING MOST OBSTINATELY
THESE STRANGE IDEAS I PROTEST PAINFULLY RECALL YOUR FATHER TO ME
HOW DID IT HAPPEN THEN THAT YOU ALLOWED YOURSELF TO SAY TO M
OBSERVE HOW THE SHADE AND THE DAMP SITUATION SUIT IT PARTICULARLY THE SHADOW WHICH THAT SYCAMORE-TREE CASTS OVER IT SO THAT THE WARMTH AND NOT THE BLAZING HEAT OF THE SUN FILTERS THROUGH ITS LEAVES RAOUL STOPPED BIT HIS LIPS AND THEN WITH THE BLOOD MANTLING IN HIS FACE HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY,--"ONE WORD OF EXPLANATION I BEG MONSIEUR
LE COMTE DE LA FERE WHO SO POWERFULLY ASSISTED IN THE RESTORATION OF KING CHARLES II
RAOUL WAS AS CALM AS IF HE WERE HANDLING A FOIL INSTEAD OF A SWORD
YOU SO PROUD SAID THE MARQUISE DISDAINFULLY
THERE IS TIME ENOUGH YET TO TELL RAOUL OF IT BLUNDERER ON THE CONTRARY IT IS TOO LATE REPLIED MONTALAIS
THE SECOND FLOOR OF LA BERTAUDIERE
DROPS OF BLOOD BENEATH HIS COAT STAINED THE FINE LINEN THAT CLOTHED HIS CHEST
D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS QUIETLY BITING THE CORNER OF HIS MOUSTACHE SAID I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR TO BEG YOU TO STATE THE PARTICULARS OF THE GRIEVANCES YOU SAY YOU HAVE AGAINST ME ALOUD CERTAINLY ALOUD IN THAT CASE I WILL SPEAK SPEAK MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN BOWING
RAOUL HAD PRESERVED THE FIRMEST AND MOST INDIFFERENT COUNTENANCE ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT LOST A WORD THAT PASSED
SOMETHING LIKE A PRESENTIMENT FLASHED ACROSS HIS MIND
I WAS SAYING CONTINUED BAISEMEAUX THAT A GOOD-SIZED FOWL COSTS ME A FRANC AND A HALF AND THAT A FINE FISH COSTS ME FOUR OR FIVE FRANCS
BUCKINGHAM THOUGHTFUL AND KIND IN HIS MANNER LIKE A MAN WHO HAS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION LISTENED TO THE COUNT AND FROM TIME TO TIME CAST A LOOK FULL OF REGRET AND HOPELESS AFFECTION AT MADAME
AH SAID HE YOU TWO GENTLEMEN INTEND TO WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT PRECAUTION BEFORE YOU MEASURE YOUR SWORDS AGAINST MINE VERY WELL MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL SINCE YOU POSITIVELY WILL HAVE IT SO LET US SETTLE THE AFFAIR NOW AND DRAWING HIS SWORD HE ADVANCED TOWARDS DE WARDES
LET ME EXPLAIN IT BY A SINGLE WORD--VIRTUE
IN THE USUAL WAY MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE MAN
WE ARE THREE IN NUMBER WE LIKE ONE ANOTHER AND THE NIGHT IS LOVELY
ONE WORD MY LORD HE SAID
COLBERT'S MEN WHERE WAS THAT OPPOSITE THE STABLES BAH
DO YOU NOT SEE HIM YES NOW I DO
STILL HE IS INTRUSIVE
DE BRAGELONNE HAS SAID NOTHING WHO CAN IT BE THEN
COME REPLIED THE PRINCE AS HIS ONLY ANSWER TO THE REMARK HURRYING HIM AWAY AND TURNING ROUND WITH SO HASTY A MOVEMENT THAT HE ALMOST RAN AGAINST MADAME
THE GIRL'S NAME IS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE AND SHE IS SUFFICIENTLY PRETTY TO WARRANT THIS CAPRICE BECOMING A STRONG ATTACHMENT
IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER LOVED YOU SO TRULY AS NOW
EVEN MORE THAN USUAL REPLIED FOUQUET
YOU OFFER ME YOUR FRIENDSHIP
I CHOSE YOU FOR YOUR GENTLE AND SIMPLE TASTES
AND CAN I HAVE BEEN HAPPY ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE OFFENDED YOU BY MY CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU REALLY MONSIEUR SAID LA VALLIERE SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS YOU SPEAK IN ENIGMAS AND I SUPPOSE I AM TOO IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND YOU BE IT SO SAID FOUQUET
I UNDERSTAND IT PERFECTLY MONSEIGNEUR AS I DO MY OWN LANGUAGE TELL US ALL ABOUT THEM THEN SAID MADAME
FOUQUET'S HONOR MARGUERITE BEGAN TO LAUGH IN SO CRUEL A MANNER THAT MADAME DE BELLIERE COULD AT THAT MOMENT HAVE DELIGHTEDLY PLUNGED A DAGGER IN HER BOSOM
THE PALE-GOLD HUES OF THE EVENING WERE VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON THROUGH THE VISTAS OF THE WOOD AND THE MOON WHITE AS SNOW WAS ALREADY MOUNTING THE HEAVENS
AND DEFENDING MYSELF LIKE ALL WEAK LOVING DISPOSITIONS AGAINST THE OPPRESSIONS OF THE STRONGER LA VALLIERE DOES NOT SAY A WORD DOES SHE NOT APPROVE OF WHAT WE ARE SAYING NAY
I HAVE WELL WEIGHED THE UNFORTUNATE AFFAIR IN WHICH I HAVE EMBARKED
THE WHOLE FRENCH COURT RAN TO THE HARBOR WHILE THE QUAYS AND JETTIES WERE SOON COVERED BY CROWDS OF PEOPLE
MALICORNE SAID MONTALAIS
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNG LADY IN WHOM YOUR FRIEND IS SO INTERESTED MLLE
SIRE I DID NOT FIGHT UPON YOUR MAJESTY'S TERRITORY PERHAPS THE DISTINCTION IS SOMEWHAT SUBTLE BUT SINCE PORT-ROYAL YOUR NATION DELIGHTS IN SUBTLETIES OF EXPRESSION
MONSIEUR MOREOVER HAD BEEN TOLERABLY SUCCESSFUL IN SWIMMING AND HIS MUSCLES HAVING BEEN EXERCISED BY THE HEALTHY IMMERSION IN THE COOL WATER HE WAS IN A LIGHT AND CHEERFUL STATE OF MIND AND BODY
HIS DARK SHADOW GLIDED LENGTHENING AS IT DISAPPEARED AMONG THE ILLUMINED YEWS AND GLITTERING UNDULATIONS OF THE WATER
AND THE SOLDIER HAVING LEFT THE ROOM BAISEMEAUX HIMSELF CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM DREW ASIDE ONE OF THE WINDOW-CURTAINS AND LOOKED STEADFASTLY AT ARAMIS TO SEE IF THE PRELATE REQUIRED ANYTHING FURTHER
THE WINDOWS WERE CLOSED
BAISEMEAUX REPLIED MERELY BY A NOD OF THE HEAD WHILE ARAMIS WITH A RESPECT ARISING PERHAPS FROM THE SIGHT OF SUCH MISFORTUNE SALUTED THE PRISONER PROFOUNDLY
I SAY I AM GOING TO BELONG TO HER HOUSEHOLD AS MAID OF HONOR
MONTALAIS PERHAPS WITH HER USUAL CHATTERING PROPENSITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DISPOSED TO TALK ABOUT IT
AND AS FOR MY CLOTHES SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HER SIMPLE MUSLIN DRESS YOUR MAJESTY SEES THERE IS BUT LITTLE ROOM FOR INJURY INDEED I HAVE ALREADY NOTICED MORE THAN ONCE THAT YOU OWED NEARLY EVERYTHING TO YOURSELF AND NOTHING TO YOUR TOILETTE
WE DID NOT EVEN LOSE A SINGLE WORD BUT THE HAUGHTY ATHENAIS WAS NOT A WOMAN TO FAINT EASILY
CHAPTER XLIV
THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD ARRIVED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD LIVED THE DIFFICULTY WHICH EXISTED FOR EVERY ONE BUT CERTAIN PRIVILEGED TRAVELERS OF ENTERING THE HOTEL WITHOUT A PASSWORD OR LIVING THERE WITHOUT CERTAIN PREPARATORY PRECAUTIONS MUST HAVE STRUCK MALICORNE
JUST NOW INDEED IN THE PARK I SAW THAT YOU HAD FAINTED
I AM GOING TO VISIT THE TOWERS SAID THE GOVERNOR
BUT MONSIEUR BORE A GRUDGE AGAINST HIS WIFE
THESE TWO TITLES ARE ALSO GIVEN TO DIFFERENT VOLUMES
I HAVE WRITTEN THIS MAN'S NAME UPON THE LETTRE DE CACHET WHICH YOUR MAJESTY HAS BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE ME SO THAT M
COLBERT HAS DONE WHAT HE HAD TO DO IN AN EXCEEDINGLY ORDERLY MANNER AND THAT HE DESERVES IN THIS RESPECT ALL THE PRAISE YOUR MAJESTY MAY BESTOW UPON HIM THE WORD ORDERLY WAS A PROPER ACCOMPANIMENT FOR THE WORD CLERK THE KING POSSESSED THAT EXTREME SENSITIVENESS OF ORGANIZATION THAT DELICACY OF PERCEPTION WHICH PIERCED THROUGH AND DETECTED THE REGULAR ORDER OF FEELINGS AND SENSATIONS BEFORE THE ACTUAL SENSATIONS THEMSELVES AND HE THEREFORE COMPREHENDED THAT THE CLERK HAD IN FOUQUET'S OPINION BEEN TOO FULL OF METHOD AND ORDER IN HIS ARRANGEMENTS
YES I WAS GUILTY OF THAT DISHONORABLE ACTION
IF THIS BE THE CASE AS VERY LIKELY IT IS THERE IS ONLY HALF THE MISCHIEF DONE FOR THERE IS SIMPLY THE LENGTH OF A PURSE STRING BETWEEN MANICAMP AND MALICORNE AFTER HE HAD THUS REASONED THE MATTER OUT MALICORNE SLEPT SOUNDLY LEAVING THE SEVEN TRAVELERS TO OCCUPY AND IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD TO WALK UP AND DOWN THEIR SEVERAL LODGINGS IN THE HOTEL
WHAT DO YOU SAY
UNLESS INDEED HIS MAJESTY KING CHARLES II SHOULD HAVE OTHER ORDERS FOR ME HE WELL BEG YOU AT THE VERY LEAST I AM SURE TO REMAIN NEAR HIM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE IN THAT CASE AS I SHALL NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE I WILL NOW BEFOREHAND ENTREAT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS TO HAVE THE GOODNESS TO REMIND THE KING OF FRANCE THAT ONE OF HIS DEVOTED SERVANTS IS FAR AWAY FROM HIM TAKE CARE THAT WHEN YOU ARE RECALLED YOU DO NOT CONSIDER HIS COMMAND AN ABUSE OF POWER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU MADAME THE COURT OF FRANCE IS NOT EASILY MATCHED I AM AWARE BUT YET WE HAVE SOME PRETTY WOMEN AT THE COURT OF ENGLAND ALSO RAOUL SMILED
IN OTHER WORDS TO SPARE YOUR LIFE AT LEAST SO AS TO LEAVE ME THE PLEASURE AFTER YOUR RECOVERY OF KILLING YOU OUTRIGHT
WHAT WAS CAUGHT AFTER THE BUTTERFLIES
BUT AS MADAME ON HER SIDE FREQUENTLY GLANCED AT LA VALLIERE DE GUICHE'S EYES FOLLOWING MADAME'S WERE FROM TIME TO TIME CAST UPON THE YOUNG GIRL
I MAY HAVE EXASPERATED YOUR HIGHNESS AND CAUSED YOU SOME DISSATISFACTION
CHAPTER XXXVIII
AGAIN I REPEAT YOU TERRIFY ME SAID FOUQUET
BE YE WITNESSES OF THIS AND TESTIFY IF NEED BE THAT SICK IN BODY BUT SOUND IN MIND I HAVE FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY BESTOWED THIS RING THE TOKEN OF SUPREME AUTHORITY UPON MONSEIGNEUR D'HERBLAY BISHOP OF VANNES WHOM I NOMINATE MY SUCCESSOR AND BEFORE WHOM I AN HUMBLE SINNER ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE HEAVEN PROSTRATE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL TO FOLLOW AND THE FRANCISCAN BOWED LOWLY AND SUBMISSIVELY WHILST THE PHYSICIAN AND THE JESUIT FELL ON THEIR KNEES
I REGARD YOU AS A BROTHER AND NOTHING MORE THE KING FROWNED
SHE LIFTED HER HANDS TO HER FACE AND ENTERED HER CARRIAGE MADAME FOLLOWING HER
DO NOT LET US COMPLAIN OF THIS HOWEVER FOR IT MAKES YOUR WIT VERY BRILLIANT AND OF A STYLE PECULIARLY YOUR OWN
MONTALAIS SAID NOTHING
DE BAISEMEAUX EXACTITUDE IS NOT A VIRTUE ONLY IT IS A DUTY AS WELL YES IN MATTERS OF BUSINESS CERTAINLY
DO ME THIS KINDNESS,--GRANT ME THIS FAVOR
DE GUICHE OF M
THERE WAS NOT MOREOVER EITHER IN FOUQUET'S VOICE OR LOOK ANYTHING WHICH INJURIOUSLY AFFECTED A SINGLE SYLLABLE OF THE REMARK HE HAD MADE
BUT THE PRINCESS WAS LAUGHING AND SMILING WITH MADAME DE NOAILLES
A THOUSAND THANKS SAID MALICORNE
COVERS THE YEARS 1648-1649
YOU WILL FIND HER EVERYWHERE
OH SIRE READ READ AND SAINT-AIGNAN READ
FOUQUET HE SAID SMILING GRACIOUSLY
AND HE BENT DOWN HIS HEAD LIKE AN EXHAUSTED SWIMMER BENEATH THE WAVE WHICH ENGULFS HIM
DID YOU HEAR WHAT THE COMTE DE GUICHE SAID THE PRINCESS INQUIRED
NEVER LET ANYTHING LIE ABOUT WHICH CAN BE USED AGAINST OURSELVES AGREED DECIDED SWORN TO
FOUQUET THREW HIMSELF UPON A COUCH AND THEN POINTED TO THE DOOR TO THE SERVANT WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM
I SAID AND WHICH MY CONSCIENCE INDUCES ME TO MAKE THIS LATTER EXPRESSION BELIEVE ME IS BETTER THAN THE FORMER
NO NO EXCLAIMED THE DUKE TAKE THE MARQUIS ON SHORE FIRST DEATH TO THE FRENCHMAN CRIED THE ENGLISH SULLENLY
CHAPTER LI
A GREAT NUMBER OF COURTIERS ALSO SELECTED OCCUPIED THE TIME BEFORE THE DANCING COMMENCED IN CONVERSING AS PEOPLE KNEW HOW TO CONVERSE IN THOSE TIMES
AND WHAT HAS THE KING TO DO WITH IT EXCLAIMED AURE SHARPLY
FROM THE MOVEMENTS ON BOARD--FROM THE FLUTTERINGS AND AGITATIONS OF THE CURTAINS--THE GOINGS TO AND FRO OF THE FEMALE ATTENDANTS ENGAGED IN THEIR DUTIES COULD BE GUESSED
THERE WAS IN FACT SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY TO ADMIRE--THE BRILLIANCE FOR SOME AND THE CUTTING FOR OTHERS
THE KING REMAINED SILENT
AND UPON MY HONOR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN AND YOU HAD NOTHING THEN TO DO WITH HER ADMISSION NO YOU DO NOT KNOW HER I SAW HER FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DAY SHE WAS PRESENTED TO MADAME
MONSEIGNEUR A PLEASANT JOURNEY TO THE VICOMTE WHOM I LIKE VERY MUCH
AS EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK HER ROYAL HIGHNESS ENTERED THE GREAT DRAWING-ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY HER LADIES IN ATTENDANCE AND FOUND SEVERAL GENTLEMEN BELONGING TO THE COURT ALREADY THERE HAVING BEEN WAITING FOR SOME MINUTES
SEE THE FLYING SQUADRON IS ADVANCING AS GOOD QUEEN CATHERINE USED TO SAY
WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN SO BECAUSE I INTERFERED WITH YOUR SARABANDS AND YOUR OTHER SPANISH AMUSEMENTS
OF THE KING OF ENGLAND WITHOUT ALLUDING TO HIS SISTER
ARE THEY NOT YOUR OWN ASKED LOUISE
SHALL WE GET INTO THAT BOAT THEN AND PUSH OFF
ASSUREDLY I SHALL NOT FOR ONE
TO APPEAR IN A CONTRADICTORY HUMOR WAS ONE OF THE STRATAGEMS OF THE GOOD QUEEN IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN ASCERTAINING THE TRUTH
IT IS FOR YOU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS STATE OF THINGS
WILL YOU TELL US HOW YOU INTEND TO RESIST YIELDING TO TEMPTATION IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE HURRIED AWAY BY FEELINGS OF AFFECTION OH EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG GIRL RAISING TOWARDS THE DARK HEAVENS HER BEAUTIFUL LARGE EYES FILLED WITH TEARS IF YOU DID BUT KNOW WHAT A HEART IS I WOULD EXPLAIN AND CONVINCE YOU
DO YOU KNOW M
BAISEMEAUX
BAISEMEAUX
BAISEMEAUX
DOES NOT THINK MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE EITHER RICH ENOUGH OR PRETTY ENOUGH FOR A GENTLEMAN OF THE RANK OF THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE
BUT THIS TIME MALICORNE HELD IT AT A DISTANCE
IN ORDER TO KNOW WHAT DAY I SHALL SUBMIT MY INVITATION TO THE KING THIS VERY EVENING MONSEIGNEUR THIS VERY EVENING AGREED SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT
ONE DAY IN THE WINTER IT FELL UPON THE MARBLE FLOOR ON THE LOUVRE AND WAS BROKEN
I CAME TO TALK WITH YOU AS WELL AS TO SEE YOU VERY WELL WE WILL TALK BY AND BY AND IN ANOTHER PLACE THAN THIS BY AND BY
TO GIVE HIM OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME OF HIS SEVERE REMARKS AND MORAL REFLECTIONS AND TO UNDO WHAT WE HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE IN EFFECTING
ALL THESE MEN ARE EITHER SPIES OR A SORT OF POLICE NOT ONE OF THEM A GENERAL
LA VALLIERE MORE REFINED AND MORE BASHFUL ALLOWED HER DRESS TO FLOW AROUND HER
SIRE MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE IS A VERY EFFICACIOUS REMEDY SAID MADAME WITH A SIGH
MY OWN MOTHER TAKES THE PART OF MY WIFE'S LOVER AGAINST ME EXCLAIMED PHILIP INCENSED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HIS WEAK ORGANIZATION WAS AFFECTED ALMOST TO TEARS
FRANCE IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ESPECIALLY ALONG THE ROUTE BY WHICH THE PROCESSION PASSED
THE KING WILL BE INCENSED AT OUR DISOBEDIENCE PARTICULARLY AT SUCH A TIME,--AND HIS MAJESTY WILL BE IN THE RIGHT EXCUSES MURMURED DE WARDES
MY RIGHT MY RIGHT FIRST OF ALL EXCLAIMED THE FIERY YOUNG MAN
MUST THE SOCIETY INDEED FALL WITH ME FOR WANT OF A COLUMN TO SUPPORT IT
AND BY A PATH BEYOND THE GROUP OF TREES SHE REGAINED THE FLOWER-GARDEN
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WAS THERE TOO YES MADAME FOR YOU CANNOT DISGUISE IT FROM YOURSELF ATHENAIS SAINT-AIGNAN TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SOME VERY FLATTERING REMARKS YOU MADE ABOUT HIM WELL MADAME YOU SEE VERY CLEARLY THAT ONE CAN BE OVERHEARD CRIED ATHENAIS SINCE M
BUT MADAME HE CONTINUED YOU DO NOT REMARK THAT YOUR LADIES DEPRIVE ME OF MY FRIENDS
HE HAD IMMEDIATELY REMARKED DE GUICHE'S MELANCHOLY AND DIVINED THE NATURE OF HIS REGARD FOR THE PRINCESS
AT THIS MOMENT FOUR OF THE DUKE'S SAILORS WHO COMPREHENDED THE DANGER THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE SEA AND IN A MOMENT WERE CLOSE BESIDE HIM
ARAMIS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN SIGN OF PITY TOOK THE GLASS AND POURED OUT THE CONTENTS AMONG THE ASHES OF THE HEARTH
RAOUL INQUIRED MONTALAIS
SHE WHO UNDERSTANDS IN FACT THE LANGUAGE OF THE WIND AMONG THE BRANCHES THE HUMMING OF THE INSECT WITH ITS GOLD AND EMERALD WINGS IN THE COROLLA OF THE WILD-FLOWERS
FOR THE LAST HOUR WE HAVE BEEN BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH AND AT LAST YOU HAVE BROACHED THE TRUE QUESTION WELL THEN YES THIS IS MORE SERIOUS THAN I THOUGHT
IT MAKES A DISPLAY AND THAT IS ALL SHE CARES ABOUT
THE APPOINTMENT ARRIVED
BUT THAT IS NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD ABANDON YOUR COMPANION
HE BEGINS TO WALK AGAIN HE EXERCISES HIS MUSCULAR POWERS BY BENDING DOWN YOUNG ELM-TREES OR MAKING THE OLD OAKS FLY INTO SPLINTERS AS MILO OF CROTONA USED TO DO
ONE OF THE FIRST GENTLEMEN OF EUROPE OBLIGED TO LEAVE THE COURT OF THE KING OF FRANCE OF LOUIS XIV LIKE A BEGGAR ON ACCOUNT OF A GLANCE OR A BOUQUET
HER LANGUISHING EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS
QUITE SURE LOVE HER THEN AT A DISTANCE WHAT
DE SAINT-AIGNAN LEFT NO DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT DID YOU THEN SAY ANYTHING VERY DISRESPECTFUL OF THE KING NOT AT ALL
IT IS THE LOSS OF ONE MAN--NOTHING MORE REPLIED THE FRANCISCAN FOR HEAVEN WILL ENABLE THE POOR MONK WHO IS ABOUT TO LEAVE YOU TO FIND A WORTHY SUCCESSOR
YOU TREAT ME AS A CRIMINAL AT THE BAR
MADAME WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT MOVE AND SMILING AT HER HUSBAND SAID IS NOT THIS THE HOUR YOU USUALLY DEVOTE TO YOUR TOILETTE AN HOUR WHICH OTHERS SELECT IT SEEMS FOR AMUSING THEMSELVES REPLIED THE PRINCE GRUMBLINGLY
THE VENETIAN THEREUPON RECEIVED DIRECTIONS TO SET OFF IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND LEFT AS RADIANT AS IF HE ALREADY POSSESSED THE RING THE SIGN OF THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF THE SOCIETY
WHILE THE TERRIFIED DEER BOUNDED RIVERWARDS FROM THE MIDST OF THE THICKETS
I LOVE DE BRAGELONNE WITH MY WHOLE HEART
WELL SINCE HE WILL HAVE IT SO MURMURED MANICAMP IN GUICHE'S EAR DO AS HE WANTS YOU TO DO WELL MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE COMTE I OBEY AND TO BEGIN RESUMED THE PRINCE THERE WILL BE CARDS THIS EVENING IN MADAME'S APARTMENT
AS FOR MYSELF AS MY FRIEND TOLD YOU MY ROOM IS A SEPARATE AFFAIR SO LET US COME TO TERMS ABOUT IT
IT MATTERS SO FAR AS THIS SAID THE LANDLORD WHO BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT ONE PERSON HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR ANOTHER THAT I BEG YOU MONSIEUR TO LEAVE THE ROOMS WHICH HAD BEEN ENGAGED BEFOREHAND AND BY SOME ONE ELSE INSTEAD OF YOU STILL SAID MALICORNE THIS GENTLEMAN CANNOT REQUIRE AT THE SAME TIME A ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND AN APARTMENT ON THE SECOND
LA VALLIERE ACKNOWLEDGED THE CEREMONIOUS SALUTATION WHICH FOUQUET ADDRESSED TO HER BY A GENTLE INCLINATION OF THE HEAD AND MOTIONED HIM TO A SEAT
THE FIRST WORDS WERE HARDLY SPOKE WHEN THEY HEARD A HORSE GALLOPING AWAY OVER THE STONES OF THE PUBLIC HIGH-ROAD OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE CHATEAU
THE KING FELT MADAME WITHDRAW HER HANDS CARESSING HIS FACE WHILE SHE DID SO
FOUQUET SAID BUCKINGHAM I LEAVE THE CAPTAIN WITH YOU HE IS MORE LEARNED THAN I AM IN BASTIONS SCARPS AND COUNTER-SCARPS AND I WILL JOIN ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAS JUST BECKONED ME SAYING THIS BUCKINGHAM DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE GROUP AND ADVANCED TOWARDS RAOUL STOPPING FOR A MOMENT AT THE TABLE WHERE THE QUEEN-MOTHER THE YOUNG QUEEN AND THE KING WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
SHE IS NOT YET QUITE CERTAIN OF IT
HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE IN THE COURTYARD AND FOLLOWED THE ROAD TO BLOIS WHILE THE MARRIAGE FESTIVITIES OF MONSIEUR AND THE PRINCESS OF ENGLAND WERE BEING CELEBRATED WITH EXCEEDING ANIMATION BY THE COURTIERS BUT TO THE DESPAIR OF DE GUICHE AND BUCKINGHAM
WHAT IS IT INQUIRED LOUIS
I SHALL LEAVE TO-MORROW HE ADDED
WHEN EYES LOOK LANGUISHINGLY WHILE THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION HAPPENS TO BE COLORS OF MATERIALS FOR DRESSES
ON THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE GALLERY DAZZLING WITH THE BLAZE OF LIGHT WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN OF THE COURT MOVED TO AND FRO LIKE STARS IN THEIR OWN ATMOSPHERE RAOUL COULD NOT PREVENT HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT FORGETTING DE GUICHE IN ORDER TO SEEK OUT LOUISE WHO AMIDST HER COMPANIONS LIKE A DOVE COMPLETELY FASCINATED GAZED LONG AND FIXEDLY UPON THE ROYAL CIRCLE WHICH GLITTERED WITH JEWELS AND GOLD
FORGIVE ME MONSIEUR LE COMTE BUT I BELIEVE A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE
IT WOULD BE A CONSOLATION FOR ME SHE SAID IF YOU WERE TO RETURN ON THE DAY WHEN I SHALL BE CARRIED TO MY FINAL RESTING-PLACE AT SAINT-DENNIS BESIDE THE KING MY HUSBAND MADAME YOU ARE GOODNESS ITSELF
HUM
WHEN LA VALLIERE'S CARRIAGE PASSED THE KING APPROACHED IT SALUTED THE LADIES WHO WERE INSIDE AND WAS PREPARING TO ACCOMPANY THE CARRIAGE CONTAINING THE MAIDS OF HONOR IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD FOLLOWED THAT IN WHICH MADAME WAS WHEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE FILE OF CARRIAGES STOPPED
TOO FAR INDEED
GENTLEMEN LIKE OURSELVES SHOULD BE CAREFUL GUARDIANS OF THE HONOR OF OUR QUEENS AND OUR PRINCESSES
YOU SPOKE TO HIM IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM
DO PEOPLE REALLY EVER LOVE SHE SAID
AND THEN AS IF TO SHOW THAT HE KNEW THE FOLLY OF HIS CONDUCT AND THAT HE WISHED TO CORRECT BY THE HUMBLEST SUBMISSION HIS FLIGHTS OF ABSURDITY HE MASTERED HIS HORSE AND COMPELLED HIM REEKING WITH SWEAT AND FLECKED WITH FOAM TO CHAMP HIS BIT CLOSE BESIDE THE CARRIAGE AMIDST THE CROWD OF COURTIERS
HE DID NOT WISH TO INSPIRE OTHERS WITH TOO EXALTED AN OPINION OF HIMSELF AND THEREFORE WAITED PATIENTLY AND IN SILENCE LEANING UPON THE SADDLE-BOW OF HIS HORSE
IN WHAT MANNER AND BY WHOSE MEANS COULD YOU POSSIBLY BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH A SECRET THROUGH MADAME DE CHEVREUSE THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF THE QUEEN AND MADAME DE CHEVREUSE IS DEAD DID ANY OTHERS KNOW IT A MAN AND A WOMAN ONLY AND THEY OF THE LOWER CLASSES WHO ARE THEY PERSONS WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEM DEAD ALSO
THE DAY ON WHICH THE PRESENT CHAPTER OPENS INVITATIONS HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR A LATE SUPPER IN THE QUEEN-MOTHER'S APARTMENTS AS SHE INTENDED THAT TWO BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND BRACELETS OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP SHOULD BE PUT INTO A LOTTERY
THAT IN THE SECOND YOU MUST HAVE THE LETTER BACK AGAIN EVEN WERE IT TO COST YOU A MILLION
THEREFORE AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE FRANCISCAN AT HIS MELANCHOLY LOOK AND SEEING THE PLAINNESS OF THE ROOM HE STOPPED AND INQUIRED,--"WHO HAS SUMMONED ME I SAID THE FRANCISCAN WHO TURNED TOWARDS THE CONFESSOR SAYING MY GOOD FATHER LEAVE US FOR A MOMENT TOGETHER
HIS MAJESTY THEN RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS WIFE
THE QUEEN MARIA WITH AN ATTACHMENT WHICH CAN BE WELL UNDERSTOOD FOLLOWS WITH HER EYES EVERY STEP OF YOUR MAJESTY WHICH SEPARATES YOU FROM HER
WE SHALL SET OFF IN A FEW HOURS WHITHER FOR PARIS PARIS MONSIEUR IS NOT THE KING AT PARIS CERTAINLY WELL OUGHT WE NOT TO GO THERE YES MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL ALMOST ALARMED BY THIS KIND CONDESCENSION
BESIDES WE OWE HIM THIS SLIGHT FAVOR FOR THE COURAGE HE DISPLAYED IN VENTURING TO SEEK US IN SUCH A TERRIBLE STRESS OF WEATHER BUCKINGHAM OPENED HIS LIPS AS IF HE WERE ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT WHETHER THOUGHTS OR EXPRESSIONS FAILED HIM NOT A SYLLABLE ESCAPED THEM AND TURNING AWAY AS THOUGH OUT OF HIS MIND HE LEAPT FROM THE VESSEL INTO THE BOAT
THE CHAFFINCH AND TOMTIT FLEW AWAY IN CLOUDS
THEY HAVE ALL DISCOVERED A PLOT BUT NOT ONE OF THEM A SECRET
BUCKINGHAM ALSO WHO HAD PERCEIVED THEIR EXPRESSION THREW HIMSELF BETWEEN THE TWO ADVERSARIES WHOM HE HAD EXPECTED TO SEE PRECIPITATE THEMSELVES ON EACH OTHER
WILL YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO COME AND SEE ME
FOR I MUST NOT OMIT TO TELL YOU ONE THING WHAT IS IT I BEGIN TO MISTRUST D'ARTAGNAN
NEITHER HER VOICE NOR HER PEN WERE IDLE FOR A MOMENT
MADAME THE CREDIT OF MY PROTECTOR IS INCONTESTABLE AND HIS PROMISES ARE AS GOOD AS DEEDS AND WOULD IT BE INDISCREET TO ASK YOU THE NAME OF THIS POWERFUL PROTECTOR OH
YOU ARE SUFFERING ASKED RAOUL
THE KING DREW BACK TOWARDS THE DARKEST PART OF THE VESTIBULE
AS IF SHE ONLY AWAITED THIS SIGNAL TO DISCHARGE HER SHAFT MARGUERITE EXCLAIMED WELL ELISE IT IS SAID YOU ARE IN LOVE AND SHE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT MADAME DE BELLIERE WHO BLUSHED AGAINST HER WILL
SHE SEEMED AS LIFELESS AS THOSE BEAUTIFUL VISIONS OF OUR DREAMS THAT PASS BEFORE THE MENTAL EYE OF THE SLEEPER HALF-OPENING THEIR WINGS WITHOUT MOVING THEM UNCLOSING THEIR LIPS WITHOUT A SOUND ESCAPING THEM
AGAIN IT WAS REMARKED THAT THE QUEEN-MOTHER FIXING A LONG AND THOUGHTFUL GAZE UPON BUCKINGHAM LEANED TOWARDS MADAME DE MOTTEVILLE AS THOUGH TO ASK HER DO YOU NOT SEE HOW MUCH HE RESEMBLES HIS FATHER AND FINALLY IT WAS REMARKED THAT MONSIEUR WATCHED EVERYBODY AND SEEMED QUITE DISCONTENTED
WHY WOMEN ARE THE VERIEST SERPENTS SAID MALICORNE
AND CONSEQUENTLY AS WE ARE THE KING'S AMBASSADORS THE SQUARE BELONGS TO US I HAVE ALREADY ASKED YOU WHO YOU ARE MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED BUCKINGHAM EXASPERATED AT THE COOLNESS OF HIS INTERLOCUTOR
A MILLION REPEATED DE GUICHE DAILY
I TRUST THAT YOU APPRECIATE THE HONOR CONFERRED UPON YOU M
FOR SHE IS A WOMAN OF GREAT IMAGINATION CAPRICIOUS AND SELF-WILLED DE WARDES AND MANICAMP IN THEIR SELF-ASSUMED CHARACTER OF COURTIERS HAD ANNOUNCED THE PRINCESS'S ARRIVAL
SEEING HER LAUGH HIS UNEASINESS ON HER ACCOUNT DIMINISHED AND HE ADDRESSED HER IN A VIVACIOUS TONE HIMSELF
HAVE YOU PAID YOUR THREE YEARS PROFITS TO LOUVIDRE AND TREMBLAY MOST CERTAINLY I HAVE SO THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE TO GIVE THEM THAN THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME NOTHING HAVE YOU NOT SAVED ANYTHING THEN MY LORD IN GIVING THE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS OF MY OWN TO THESE GENTLEMEN I ASSURE YOU THAT I GAVE THEM EVERYTHING I GAIN
MOREOVER ALL THAT THE KING TOUCHES IS CONVERTED INTO GOLD WELL MADAME REST ASSURED OF ONE THING NAMELY THAT I AM STILL GRATEFUL TO YOU
YOU HAVE ALL THE DEFECTS AND ALL THE QUALITIES OF YOUTH I HAVE BEEN BETRAYED OR DENOUNCED THEN BY WHOM BY THOSE WHO AT LE HAVRE HAD WITH INFERNAL PERSPICACITY READ MY HEART LIKE AN OPEN BOOK I DO NOT KNOW WHOM YOU MEAN M
IF INSTEAD OF LEAVING ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AFFAIR TO THESE WOMEN ONE OF THE COURTIERS HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE INTRIGUE HOW DELIGHTEDLY WOULD LOUIS HAVE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF TURNING THE BASTILE TO PERSONAL ACCOUNT
I AM NOTHING
HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS IF I SHALL MEET YOU BY AND BY IN ANOTHER PLACE
WILL YOU NOT GO WITH ME TO MY LODGINGS SAID ATHOS
DO YOU DECIDE UPON OUR CONDUCT AND SAY WHETHER IT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN PERFECTLY CORRECT OH CERTAINLY--PERFECTLY CORRECT OFTEN ALONE TOGETHER,--FOR WE DELIGHT IN THE SAME THINGS,--WE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE LED AWAY INTO ERROR BUT HAVE WE BEEN
I TOLD M
HELP HELP EXCLAIMED TWO VOICES
THE COUNT ADVANCED A STEP TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND PRESSED HIM WARMLY IN HIS ARMS
THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE LEANING HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOORWAY SMILED LIKE A MAN IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THE FRANKEST ADMIRATION
YOU ATHOS WITH YOUR LOYALTY YOUR FRANKNESS YOUR COOL COURAGE AND YOUR SOUND INFORMATION ARE THE VERY MAN KINGS NEED TO WARN AND DIRECT THEM
BUT YOU CANNOT SURELY FORGET THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER NO DOUBT
FOR I HAVE DIRECTED DINNER TO BE SERVED HERE YET SEE MONSEIGNEUR HOW DULL WE SHALL BE
YOU CHANGE COLOR MY LORD SAID ATHOS TURNING TO THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AND YOUR EYES KINDLE WITH ANGER AND SORROW
IN FACT SEEING THE KING AT THE DOOR OF HER CARRIAGE AS SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE HE WOULD BE THERE FOR THE QUEEN'S SAKE SHE HOPED THAT HER PRINCE HAD RETURNED TO HER
YOU SIRE WHO KNOW ALL SINCE YOU HAVE COME HERE
I DON'T KNOW AT ALL ONLY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT HE COULD MAKE AS MUCH AS HE PLEASED WHEN HE WAS THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST WHAT DO YOU CALL BEING THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST PRINCE IT MEANS OF COURSE WHEN THE FUNCTIONARY IN QUESTION IS A MAN WHO HAS HIS WITS ABOUT HIM IN THAT CASE I THINK YOUR HIGHNESS WILL BE CONTENT FOR MALICORNE IS AS SHARP AS THE DEVIL HIMSELF GOOD
IN POINT OF FACT THE KING ALL AT ONCE DID ARREST HIS HURRIED PACE
DURING THE PROGRESS OF THESE EVENTS BUCKINGHAM AND DE WARDES TRAVELED IN EXCELLENT COMPANIONSHIP AND MADE THE JOURNEY FROM PARIS TO CALAIS IN UNDISTURBED HARMONY TOGETHER
YOU LEAVE ME AT PERFECT LIBERTY I SUPPOSE ENTIRELY SO I MAY EMPLOY ALL MEANS THEN TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH ALL INTIMIDATION EVEN I CONSTITUTE YOU PUBLIC PROSECUTOR IN MY PLACE THEY WAITED TEN MINUTES LONGER BUT USELESSLY AND FOUQUET THOROUGHLY OUT OF PATIENCE AGAIN RANG LOUDLY
THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HIS OWN HEART WAS FILLED SEEMED SO GREAT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD HARDLY CONTAIN IT
LET MALICORNE HAVE THE APPOINTMENT AND MANICAMP SHALL HAVE THE MONEY
THE MORAL OF THE WHOLE MATTER IS TO REMAIN PERFECTLY NEUTRAL AND AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF SOME NEW CAPRICE AND LET THAT DECIDE THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND THE CHEVALIER THEREUPON SETTLED HIMSELF RESIGNEDLY IN THE ARMCHAIR IN WHICH MONSIEUR PERMITTED HIM TO SEAT HIMSELF IN HIS PRESENCE AND HAVING NO MORE SPITEFUL OR MALICIOUS REMARKS TO MAKE THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT DE LORRAINE'S WIT SEEMED TO HAVE DESERTED HIM
ANNE OF AUSTRIA MADE A SIGH TO HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW WHO WITHDREW WEEPING
ONLY YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM AFRAID OF--I AM AFRAID OF BEING THOUGHT JEALOUS OF THE FAVOR SHOWN WHEN I AM ONLY JEALOUS AS FAR AS FRIENDSHIP IS CONCERNED
BUT BELIEVE ME RAOUL I RESERVE FOR MYSELF A VICTORY WHICH SHALL COST HER FLOODS OF TEARS A VICTORY HE ASKED AND OF WHAT KIND OF WHAT KIND YOU ASK YES ONE DAY I WILL ACCOST HER AND WILL ADDRESS HER THUS
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT MONTALAIS BLUSHED
FOUQUET IF HE HAD LIKED
THIS IS INDEED A NIGHT FOR SECRETS AND TAKING MANICAMP'S ARM THE COMTE LED HIM RAPIDLY AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ROAD MONTALAIS KNEW SO WELL AND INDICATED SO BADLY
ETEXT 1257--FIRST BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
THE YEAR IS 1625
LET YOUR PASSION BE KINDLED GRADUALLY INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT TO BURST FORTH SO SUDDENLY
YOU DID NOT HEAR PLAINLY WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN I SAID FIVE HUNDRED AND THE FIVE HUNDRED HERE THEY ARE MANICAMP DEVOURED THE ROULEAU WITH HIS EYES
BUT THE GREATEST CONFUSION IMMEDIATELY ENSUED AMONG THE MASTERS AND VIOLENT QUARRELS AMONG THEIR ATTENDANTS
MEN VALUE LOVE MORE HIGHLY WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER BLINDED BY ITS INFLUENCE THE MARQUISE BEWILDERED AND OVERCOME BY THESE CRUEL ATTACKS WHICH HAD BEEN CALCULATED WITH THE GREATEST NICETY AND PRECISION HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO ANSWER IN RETURN
OTHERS EVEN MORE TIMID STILL WALKED ABOUT WITHOUT WANDERING TOO FAR FROM THE CARRIAGES WHERE THEY RELIED UPON TAKING SHELTER IN CASE THE STORM BURST
IN WHAT WAY SHALL I HAVE THE MONEY EITHER IN GOLD OR IN BILLS OF THE BANK OF LYONS PAYABLE AT M
MONSIEUR COLBERT
HE IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND YOUR OPINION IS THAT YOUR HIGHNESS COULD NEVER GET A BETTER USHER OF THE APARTMENTS THAN HE WILL MAKE HOW MUCH DOES THE APPOINTMENT BRING IN INQUIRED THE COMTE OF THE PRINCE
THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT MADAME GRADUALLY ACQUIRED AN IMMENSE INFLUENCE OVER THE COURT WHICH MADE HER APARTMENTS THE TRUE ROYAL PLACE OF MEETING
YES CERTAINLY THEN I WILL CONSIDER THE MATTER YAWNED FOUQUET
BETTER TO DIE THAN TO SUFFER AS I DO AT THIS MOMENT AND HE GRASPED A BEAUTIFUL DAGGER THE HANDLE OF WHICH WAS INLAID WITH PRECIOUS STONES
FOUQUET PROMISED BEEN SENT
I ADVANCED HALF A DOZEN PACES THEN THREE AND THEN BODY TO BODY I PRESSED MY ANTAGONIST CLOSELY THEN I DARTED BACK AGAIN TEN PACES
I TRUST THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL NOW REPAIR TIME LOST AND THE REPORT--YOU TELL ME--IS THAT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE NEVER HAD A LOVER IN ANY CASE I DO NOT THINK YOUR MAJESTY WOULD BE MUCH ALARMED AT THE RIVALRY YET STAY SAID THE KING IN A VERY SERIOUS TONE OF VOICE
I WOULD SPEAK OF A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH CREATED AN EPOCH IN MY LIFE AND WHICH CONSECRATED ME FROM THE AGE OF SIXTEEN TO THE DEVOTED SERVICE OF YOUR MAJESTY AH
DO YOU ACCEPT I DO YOUR LADYSHIP
A MONTH MURMURED THE PRINCESS
DE GUICHE TOOK IT AND LOOKED AT IT FOR A LONG TIME ATTENTIVELY
DE MANICAMP AND THE REST OF THEM THEY ALL BELONG TO YOUR HIGHNESS'S HOUSEHOLD YES YES YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE PRINCE AS HE RETURNED TO HIS OWN APARTMENTS FULL OF THOUGHT
THEY CONFESSED THAT LOVE IS A MIGHTY PERIL BUT THAT THE ABSENCE OF LOVE IS THE HEART'S SENTENCE OF DEATH WHAT WAS THE CONCLUSION THEY CAME TO INQUIRED MADAME
HE WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE STAFF DRUNK WITHOUT GETTING TIPSY IN THE LEAST HIMSELF AND EVERY ONE WILL REGARD HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND SYMPATHY
YOU ACCUSE ME THEREFORE OF A CRIME OR A FAULT OR OF SOME MEAN AND COWARDLY ACT
KEEN-SIGHTED AND PENETRATING A MERE GLANCE AT HIS SON TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY HAD BEFALLEN HIM
MADAME'S EYES FLASHED LIKE LIGHTNING
WHY IS LOUISE'S NAME SPOKEN OF HERE SAID RAOUL TO HIMSELF
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RUIN A MAN WITH A MORE CHARMING SMILE
IN WHAT RESPECT DOES MADAME PREFER DE GUICHE TO YOU I SHALL SAY NO MORE SAID THE CHEVALIER SALUTING THE PRINCE CEREMONIOUSLY
ONE ONLY OF THE NUMBER WHOSE LONG HAIR FELL IN SILKEN MASSES UPON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SKIN IMAGINABLE WAS PALE AND COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN HERSELF NOTWITHSTANDING THE KNOCKS WHICH HER COMPANION GAVE HER WITH HER ELBOW
I WILL TAKE DE WARDES TO KEEP ME IN COUNTENANCE WHY NOT MANICAMP
PRAY ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUNG LADIES SAID RAOUL WHO FANCIED HE PERCEIVED THEY WERE NOT DISPOSED TO ANSWER HIM IN A DIRECT MANNER
WILL YOUR MAJESTY PARDON ME
HOW SO LA VALLIERE'S REMARK WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR THE KING REACHED ITS DESTINATION THE KING KNOWS IT THEN
HE WHO BORE IT HAD TOO MUCH WIT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH FROM HIMSELF
BE IT SO SAID SAINT-AIGNAN LIKE A MAN WHO HAS MADE UP HIS MIND AND HE BEGAN
YOU MUST THEREFORE CONFIDE IN ME AS IN A FRIEND WHO GOT YOU OUT OF A GREAT DIFFICULTY YESTERDAY AND WHO NOW BEGS YOU TO DRAW HIM OUT OF ONE TO-DAY YET I TOLD YOU MONSIEUR WHAT MY OBJECT WAS
HER PHYSICIAN'S OPINIONS HER MIRROR ALSO GRIEVED HER FAR LESS THAN THE INEXORABLE WARNINGS WHICH THE SOCIETY OF THE COURTIERS AFFORDED WHO LIKE RATS IN A SHIP ABANDON THE HOLD INTO WHICH ON THE VERY NEXT VOYAGE THE WATER WILL INFALLIBLY PENETRATE OWING TO THE RAVAGES OF DECAY
CAPTAIN-LIEUTENANT OF THE MUSKETEERS OH IT IS GOOD ENOUGH
SO UNDERSTAND ME THOROUGHLY
IF IT BE ANOTHER CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS I SHALL RECOLLECT IT SOON ENOUGH A CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS FOR MYSELF ALONE SIRE REPLIED MADAME HENRIETTA
AS SOON AS BUCKINGHAM DEPARTED GUICHE IMAGINED THE COAST WOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAR FOR HIM WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE
AND YOU THINK IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO PAY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS FOR THAT
AS FOR OURSELVES WE SHALL SOON REACH SOME RETIRED SPOT WHERE NO EYES CAN SEE US AND NO STEP FOLLOW OURS
SHE THEREFORE RETURNED AT THE RISK EVEN OF LOSING HER LIFE IN THE WAY TO THAT TRAIN OF IDEAS WHICH HER RELENTLESS FRIEND HAD FORCED HER TO PURSUE
TEN YEARS LATER
THE KING ADVANCED SLOWLY TOWARDS HER
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
FOUQUET
D'ARTAGNAN WAS SO INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS THREE FRIENDS THAT SOME PORTION OF THE FULL MEASURE OF MY HATRED FALLS TO THEIR LOT AND THAT HATRED IS OF SUCH A NATURE WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY OCCURS THEY SHALL HAVE NO OCCASION TO COMPLAIN OF THEIR ALLOWANCE DE GUICHE HAD KEPT HIS EYES FIXED ON DE WARDES AND SHUDDERED AT THE BITTER MANNER IN WHICH THE YOUNG MAN SMILED
ALL THIS FOR MALICORNE WHOSE MIND BEING FULLY OCCUPIED BY HIS OWN LOVE AFFAIR AND PERSONAL AMBITION WAS A PROBLEM HE HAD NOT APPLIED HIMSELF TO SOLVE
I CANNOT ABSENT MYSELF WITHOUT THE KING'S ORDERS SINCE MY DEPARTURE WOULD INTERRUPT THE BALLET I SAID THE CHEVALIER AM TO BE ONLY A SIMPLE EGYPAN
SMILE UPON YOUR WIFE BEHAVE TO HER TO THE KING TO EVERY ONE AS USUAL
IT IS A HIGHLY CREDITABLE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE FRENCH NATION
HE FOUND MADAME ENGAGED IN CHASING BUTTERFLIES ON A LARGE LAWN BORDERED WITH HELIOTROPE AND FLOWERING BROOM
TAKE ME WITH YOU TO MADAME'S DINNER AND THAT WILL BE A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE
COLBERT WHO DEDUCTED THE OTHER SIX THOUSAND FRANCS CONDESCENDED TO ALLOW ME TO TAKE FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS AS A GRATIFICATION
MALICORNE TRIED TO HIDE HIMSELF BEHIND MONTALAIS
OH OH SAID ARAMIS IS HIS MAJESTY AWARE OF YOUR CAVERN AS WELL
CHAPTER XXXVII
ACKNOWLEDGED MADAME AS A PERSON TO BE RECOGNIZED
DE GUICHE SHONE LIKE A SUN BUT LIKE A COURTLY SUN THAT IS RESIGNED TO FILL A SUBORDINATE PART
SHE LAUGHED AT THEM AS WE DID
THE COUNT AFTER THAT KEPT A MORE CAREFUL WATCH OVER HIMSELF
HE PERCEIVED FROM THE GREATEST SURPRISE THAT THE VOICES PROCEEDED NOT FROM THE GROUND BUT FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES
IT ALL AROSE FROM A FEAR I HAD TO SEE YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME DECREASE
SIRE IT IS NOT FROM TO-DAY THAT I BELONG TO YOUR MAJESTY OH
IT IS ALMOST SUPERFLUOUS TO ADD THAT THE FORM IN QUESTION WAS THAT OF A YOUNG AND HANDSOME CAVALIER WHO IMMEDIATELY MADE A SIGN TO ANOTHER WHO THEREUPON MADE HIS APPEARANCE
NAMELY THAT IT IS NO LONGER TO THE ONLY FRIEND YOU HAVE,--IN OTHER WORDS,--TO A MAN WHO WOULD RATHER DIE THAN BETRAY YOU
HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE RETORTED BUT AT THIS MOMENT DE GUICHE QUITTED THE CARRIAGE TO JOIN THE PRINCE
TOBY
IT WAS JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THAT YOUNG NOBLEMAN WAS EMPLOYED IN SELLING THE LAST DECENT CLOTHING HE HAD LEFT
YOU SEE M
AFTER A WHILE AS THE ACCIDENT HAD NOT PRODUCED MUCH EFFECT UPON THOSE WHO HAD BEEN WALKING THE PROMENADE WAS RESUMED
HOWEVER AS HE DID NOT WISH TO BE VERY EXTRAVAGANT IN HIS EXPENSES AND AS HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE WERE TO ASK FOR A SMALL APARTMENT HE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE BEEN REFUSED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WANT OF CONSEQUENCE HE HASTENED TO CLOSE AT ONCE WITH THE INNKEEPER'S REMARK AND DECEIVE HIM WITH A CUNNING EQUAL TO HIS OWN
WAS NOT THE MINIATURE A GOOD LIKENESS I DO NOT REMEMBER
LOUISE A MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME MURMURED RAOUL AND HIS EYES WHICH DID NOT SUFFICE TO SATISFY HIS REASON WANDERED FROM LOUISE TO MONTALAIS
COME ALONG THEN THE PILOT APPROACHED THE SIDE OF THE BOAT AND THE TWO YOUNG MEN ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH EQUAL VIVACITY JUMPED INTO THE BOAT
POOR BAISEMEAUX WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMAGINE WHAT HAS BE BECOME OF ME AND MUST BE UPON THORNS YOU SHALL HAVE THE AMOUNT IN AN HOUR
MY DEAR FELLOW SIGHED MANICAMP AN APPOINTMENT IN HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S HOUSEHOLD IS ONE OF THE GRAVEST DIFFICULTIES OF OUR POSITION OH
BUT CONTINUED GUICHE ASSUMING A GREAT COLDNESS OF MANNER YOU WILL OBLIGE ME COMTE NOT TO JEST ABOUT THAT NAME
SHE WILL BEGIN TO INFLUENCE YOU ON HIS BEHALF IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU WILL NEGLECT THE OTHERS
IF I SAY THE SHEPHERD TYRCIS DEIGNS OCCASIONALLY TO CALL AMYNTAS HIS FRIEND AND TO OPEN HIS HEART TO HIM IT IS AN UNPARALLELED FAVOR WHICH THE LATTER REGARDS AS THE MOST UNBOUNDED FELICITY ALL THAT YOU SAY INTERRUPTED MADAME ESTABLISHES THE EXTREME DEVOTION OF AMYNTAS TO TYRCIS BUT DOES NOT FURNISH US WITH THE PORTRAIT OF AMYNTAS
THE CROOKED ATOMS OF DESCARTES TRIUMPHED
AS FOR DIAMONDS I HAVE THEM IN NUMBERS
I THEREFORE ALLOWED DE GUICHE TO GET IN ADVANCE AND I PROCEEDED ON MY WAY WITH A COMMENDABLE SLOWNESS OF PACE FEELING QUITE SURE THAT MY UNFORTUNATE FRIEND WOULD NOT BE RECEIVED OR IF HE HAD BEEN THAT HE WOULD RIDE OFF AGAIN AT THE VERY FIRST CROSS DISAGREEABLE ANSWER
YOU ARE NEVERTHELESS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A VERY BAD-HEARTED YOUNG MAN AURE MY DEAR AURE TAKE CARE
YOU REND MY VERY SOUL I YES
HIS MIND WAS OCCUPIED DURING THE SERVICE IN RECKONING MORE THAN ONCE THE NUMBER OF MINUTES THEN OF SECONDS WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM THE BLISSFUL MOMENT WHEN THE PROMENADE WOULD BEGIN THAT IS TO SAY THE MOMENT WHEN MADAME WOULD SET OUT WITH HER MAIDS OF HONOR
DO NOT CONFOUND US I BEG AND HE BEGAN TO LAUGH IN SO HARSH A MANNER THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE HISS OF A SERPENT
BUT HAVE YOU NO PRISONERS BELOW TEN FRANCS OH YES
DID NOT DISTURB HIMSELF
INTRUST THE CONDUCT OF THIS AFFAIR TO ME
BUT QUITE CONTRARY TO MANICAMP MALICORNE WAS TERRIBLY AMBITIOUS
BUT HE RETAINED HIS VALET DE CHAMBRE
AND IF SOMETIMES THE ILLUSTRIOUS HERO ILLUSTRIOUS SHEPHERD YOU MEAN SAID MADAME PRETENDING TO CORRECT M
AMONG THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED BEFORE THE HOUR FIXED FOR THE RECEPTION SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR ONE WHO SHE THOUGHT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FIRST IN ATTENDANCE BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE MADAME A LITTLE NEARER BUT I FEAR MONSIEUR BECAUSE HE IS JEALOUS MANICAMP CRIED THE COMTE ANGRILY AND ENDEAVORING TO OVERWHELM HIS TORMENTOR BY A LOOK WHO DID NOT HOWEVER APPEAR TO BE IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE DISTURBED BY IT
FOUQUET IN ORDER TO FIND MEANS OF CONFIDING MY PERPLEXITIES TO YOU FOR THE SOLE END AND PURPOSE THAT WHEN AT LAST WE WERE ALONE WITH NO ONE TO LISTEN TO US YOU SHOULD DEAL HYPOCRITICALLY WITH ME
BUT BENEATH THOSE ASHES THE SMOTHERED EMBERS RAGE MORE FURIOUSLY
MALICORNE WAS ALSO LEFT OUT FROM AMONGST THE MEN
I CANNOT THEREFORE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON YONDER DID YOU SEE THE KING BEFORE LEAVING YES HOW DID HE SEEM NOTHING COULD HAVE PASSED OFF BETTER OR WORSE
YOUR PASSION CONTINUED ATHOS TRANQUILLY MUST INDEED BE VERY GREAT SINCE NOTWITHSTANDING MY DISLIKE TO THIS UNION YOU PERSIST IN WANTING IT RAOUL PASSED HIS HAND TREMBLING ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD TO REMOVE THE PERSPIRATION THAT COLLECTED THERE
THE POOR GIRL LOOKED ROUND HER ON ALL SIDES AND SEEMED HALF AFRAID HALF DESIROUS OF BEING FOLLOWED
BESIDES AS A MATTER OF COURSE EVERYBODY AT THE CHATEAU WAS IGNORANT OF THE INTERVIEW WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN LA VALLIERE AND THE KING
OVERCOME BY SO GREAT A MARK OF CONFIDENCE BAISEMEAUX UNHESITATINGLY WROTE OUT AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A DEBT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS PAYABLE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRELATE
I FOUGHT AT LENS AT BLENEAU AT THE DUNES IN FRONT OF THE ARTILLERY A HUNDRED PACES IN FRONT OF THE LINE WHILE YOU--I SAY THIS PARENTHETICALLY--WERE A HUNDRED PACES BEHIND IT
DE WARDES IS IN THE BASTILE FOR THREE YEARS AND D'ARTAGNAN DRAWING THE ORDER SIGNED BY THE KING FROM HIS POCKET HELD IT TOWARDS DE WARDES
I PREFER THAT AS IT IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF YOUR MISTAKE NO EXCLAIMED PHILIP I DO NOT DRAW BACK AND I WILL PROVE ALL I ASSERTED
ONLY I MUST SHOW YOU THE WAY NOW
ATHOS WAS IN HIS STUDY MAKING ADDITIONS TO HIS MEMOIRS WHEN RAOUL ENTERED ACCOMPANIED BY GRIMAUD
REPRESENTED LEGITIMACY BY RIGHT DIVINE
THIS IS FORTUNATE INDEED HE SAID
HE LEARNED IT ACCIDENTALLY AS HE WAS LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION OF THIS YOUNG GIRL WITH HER COMPANIONS
SHE SAW BUT DID NOT LOOK AT DE GUICHE WHO IRRITATED AND REVENGEFUL TURNED HIS BACK UPON HER AS SHE PASSED HIM ESCORTED BY HER NYMPHS AND FOLLOWED BY A HUNDRED FLATTERERS
BUT BE CAREFUL IN YOUR SELECTION LEST IN OFFERING HER THE ROSE WHICH I MAY HAVE PLUCKED I FIND MYSELF CONQUERED BY YOU
AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN IT YOU WILL BELIEVE IT I HOPE YES MY DEAR GOVERNOR CERTAINLY
FOR THE COURT HOWEVER BRILLIANT IT MAY BE HAS ALWAYS SOME FALSEHOOD CONCEALED BENEATH THE FOLDS OF ITS VELVET ROBES OR THE GLITTER OF ITS DIAMONDS I REPLIED LA VALLIERE I NEVER TELL A FALSEHOOD
I MERELY ANSWERED YOU IN REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT OF A JEALOUS HUSBAND WHOSE NAME YOU DID NOT TELL ME AND WHO AS A MATTER OF COURSE HAS A WIFE
D'HERBLAY SAID THE KING MUSINGLY AS IF HIS NAME HEARD LONG SINCE WAS NOT HOWEVER UNKNOWN TO HIM
AN ARM-CHAIR A FOOTSTOOL A SMALL TABLE BESIDE HIM ON WHICH TO REST HIS HAND EVERYTHING WAS PREPARED BY THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF
I CANNOT TELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN
FROM HIS INFANCY HE HAD WITH CALCULATION BEYOND HIS AGE LENT HIS MANE AND COMPLAISANCE TO THE FOLLIES OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE
BESIDES THERE IS NOTHING TO PROVE THAT M
I YES YOU TORTURE ME WITH YOUR JESTS LISTEN TO ME LOUISE
FOR YOU HAVE RELATED MOST ADMIRABLY ALL YOU KNOW
ARE YOU AWARE VICOMTE INQUIRED THE PRINCE DE CONDE OF RAOUL WHETHER THE HOUSEHOLD HAS BEEN SELECTED BY A PERSON OF TASTE AND WHETHER THERE ARE ANY FACES WORTH LOOKING AT I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED RAOUL
THERE MUST BE A MILLION HERE YES MY JEWELS FOR WHICH I CARE NO LONGER IF YOU DO NOT LOVE ME AND FOR WHICH EQUALLY I CARE NO LONGER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU THIS IS TOO MUCH EXCLAIMED FOUQUET
I GIVE MY CONSENT ATHENAIS BEGAN TO LAUGH
FROM HER EXQUISITE EYES BLUE AS AZURE HEAVEN ON THE CLEAREST SUMMER DAY EMANATES A TENDER LIGHT WHICH REVERIE NURTURES AND LOVE DISPENSES
YOU DON'T OBJECT TO COQUETTES IT SEEMS IN MADAME CERTAINLY I DO
OUR TIME FOR LEAVING ARRIVED AND WE SET OFF OF COURSE
LOOK AND HE LED THE PRINCESS BEFORE A MIRROR IN WHICH SHE SAW HERSELF REFLECTED BLUSHING AND BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO OVERCOME A SAINT
BUT YOUR MAJESTY HAS NOT THOUGHT OF FRUITS YES
TRUE IT IS THAT ON THAT OCCASION THERE WAS FAR TOO GREAT A CONCOURSE OF PERSONS PRESENT FOR YOUR COURAGE TO BE OBSERVED AND ON THAT ACCOUNT PERHAPS YOU DID NOT REVEAL IT
AM I NOT MY OWN MASTER HE SAID AND IS THE KING THEN KING OF MY BRAIN AND OF MY FLESH YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED ARAMIS DO NOT LET US ATTACH GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MATTERS THAN IS NECESSARY
A PROOF OF WHICH IS THAT THE KING REFUSED MONSIEUR WHO SOLICITED THE POST FOR ONE OF HIS PROTEGES WELL THE KING REFUSED IT TO MONSIEUR'S PROTEGE IN ORDER TO BESTOW IT UPON THE CHEVALIER D'ARTAGNAN A YOUNGER BROTHER OF SOME GASCON FAMILY WHO HAS BEEN TRAILING HIS SWORD IN THE ANTE-CHAMBERS DURING THE LAST THIRTY YEARS FORGIVE ME IF I INTERRUPT YOU SAID RAOUL DARTING A GLANCE FULL OF SEVERITY AT DE WARDES
YOU HAVE COME HERE FOR THE COMPETITION HAVE YOU NOT YES MY FATHER YOU HOPE TO BE ELECTED GENERAL OF THE ORDER I HOPE SO YOU KNOW ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONLY YOU CAN POSSIBLY ATTAIN THIS HIGH POSITION WHICH MAKES ONE MAN THE MASTER OF MONARCHS THE EQUAL OF POPES WHO ARE YOU INQUIRED THE BARON TO SUBJECT ME TO THESE INTERROGATIONS I AM HE WHOM YOU EXPECTED THE ELECTOR-GENERAL I AM THE ELECTED YOU ARE THE FRANCISCAN DID NOT GIVE HIM TIME TO REPLY
HERE HOWEVER IS ONE WHO IS SO
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO DRAW YOU TOWARDS ME WHAT FOR
THE CHEVALIER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS OWN APARTMENT WHERE THE PRINCE HAD NO SOONER SEATED HIMSELF THAN HE GAVE FREE VENT TO HIS FURY
THREE OR FOUR TIMES EVERY YEAR HE DRAINED THE COMTE DE GUICHE AND WHEN THE COMTE DE GUICHE WAS THOROUGHLY DRAINED WHEN HE HAD TURNED OUT HIS POCKETS AND HIS PURSE BEFORE HIM WHEN HE DECLARED THAT IT WOULD BE AT LEAST A FORTNIGHT BEFORE PATERNAL MUNIFICENCE WOULD REFILL THOSE POCKETS AND THAT PURSE MANICAMP LOST ALL HIS ENERGY HE WENT TO BED REMAINED THERE ATE NOTHING AND SOLD HIS HANDSOME CLOTHES UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT REMAINING IN BED HE DID NOT WANT THEM
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
AH SAID D'ARTAGNAN
RAOUL WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO DIVINED THE POWER OF THIS WOMAN'S ATTRACTION AND AS HIS HEART WAS ALREADY ENGAGED HE ARRIVED IN THE CAPITAL FULL OF INDIFFERENCE AND DISTRUST
YOU HAVE HELD THE POST THREE YEARS AND MUST HAVE RECEIVED IN THAT TIME ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS YOU FORGET ONE CIRCUMSTANCE DEAR M
THEY HAD ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST
MANICAMP ADDED THE WORDS
I UNDERSTAND ALL
IMMEDIATELY EVERY ONE CONNOISSEURS OR NOT UTTERED VARIOUS EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE AND OVERWHELMED THE KING WITH CONGRATULATIONS
IN OTHER WORDS YOUNG LADIES THAT IS TERMED BEING A COQUETTE
A MOUTH WITH TEMPTING LIPS WHICH DEIGNED TO OPEN IN SMILES
SINCE YOUR RETURN HERE YOU HAVE A THOUSAND TIMES AND IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS CONFESSED YOUR LOVE FOR HER
I HAVE READ IN THE GREAT BOOK MANY THINGS TOO BEAUTIFUL AND TOO COMPREHENSIVE TO LONGER TAKE ANY INTEREST IN THE TRIFLING PHRASES WHICH THESE MEN WHISPER AMONG THEMSELVES WHEN THEY WISH TO DECEIVE OTHERS
I RELATE SIMPLY WHAT TOOK PLACE AS THE DRYAD RELATED IT TO ME WHAT DID YOUR DRYAD THEN CALL THESE SHEPHERDESSES
BUT YOU KNOW THE COMTE HAS THE WEAKNESS TO ASPIRE TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY SO THAT WITH THIS OBJECT IN VIEW HE HAS LEARNT ALL SORTS OF THINGS OF WHICH VERY HAPPILY YOU ARE IGNORANT
LISTEN TO ME RAOUL I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS GRACE--IT IS A VERY SIMPLE MATTER--THAT TO-DAY TO-MORROW THE FOLLOWING DAY OR ANY OTHER DAY HE MAY CHOOSE I WILL MEET HIM AT VINCENNES REFLECT DE GUICHE I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU I HAVE REFLECTED THE DUKE IS A STRANGER HERE
I DO NOT WISH TO DEPRIVE YOUR MAJESTY OF THE SERVICES HE MAY BE ABLE TO RENDER I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID THE KING
IT IS VERY ARTFUL TOO AND VERY EFFECTIVE
STAY OUTSIDE HE SAID TO THE JAILER AND WAIT FOR US AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS THE JAILER OBEYED AND WITHDREW
WHAT DID MADAME SAY NOTHING AND GUICHE AS MUCH--OH NO
BE INDULGENT RAOUL SAID DE GUICHE IN AN UNDERTONE
I SHOULD EVEN NOW THAT I REFLECT UPON IT HAVE PREFERRED THIS SYSTEM OF TACTICS TO MY OWN PRIDE FOR WAGING WAR ON MEMBERS OF THE OTHER SEX BECAUSE IT OFFERS THE ADVANTAGE SOMETIMES OF THOROUGHLY CONVINCING THEM
I WILL SPEAK TO HER WHEN SHE IS WITH HER COMPANIONS AND I WILL THEN DISCHARGE MY FIRST ARROW AT HER BE SKILLFUL SAID MADAME LAUGHING AND DO NOT MISS THE HEART THEN THE PRINCESS TOOK LEAVE OF THE KING AND WENT FORWARD TO MEET THE MERRY TROOP WHICH WAS ADVANCING WITH MUCH CEREMONY AND A GREAT MANY PRETENDED FLOURISHES OF TRUMPETS IMITATED WITH THEIR MOUTHS
A NIGHT'S REST WILL PROBABLY RESTORE ME SHALL I LEAVE YOU NO
HE MUST HAVE ARRIVED
HE HESITATED COLORED VIOLENTLY BUT COULD NOT REPLY
IF THE PRINCESS DID NOT LOOK AT YOU ATTENTIVELY YESTERDAY I AM QUITE SURE OF ONE THING WHAT IS THAT MONSEIGNEUR
HIS PURPLE REVOLTED AGAINST THE MEAN GARB OF THE POOR FRANCISCAN WHO STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND DISPLAYED THE RING WHICH PRODUCED ITS EFFECT GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE GREATNESS OF THE PERSON OVER WHOM THE FRANCISCAN EXERCISED HIS INFLUENCE
AND THAT INSTEAD OF THE MISERABLE COURT AT WHICH YOU VEGETATE I AM GOING TO RESIDE IN A COURT ALMOST ROYAL HA HA
THE NEXT DAY THE FETES TOOK PLACE ACCOMPANIED BY ALL THE POMP AND ANIMATION THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE TOWN AND THE CHEERFUL DISPOSITION OF MEN'S MINDS COULD SUPPLY
LET MALICORNE ARRANGE MATTERS WITH YOU IN THE BEST WAY HE CAN
THEN I STARTED JOYOUSLY ENOUGH--MY HEART FREE MY MIND INTOXICATED BY THOUGHTS OF HAPPINESS IN STORE FOR ME HOPES OF WHICH THE FUTURE WAS FULL
SAINT-AIGNAN HOPING BY THIS MANEUVER TO ATTRACT ATHENAIS'S ATTENTION TOWARDS HIM APPROACHED THE YOUNG GIRL AND SALUTED HER WITH A RESPECT THAT INDUCED SOME TO BELIEVE THAT HE WISHED TO BALANCE ATHENAIS BY LOUISE
YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND I HOPE THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE PERFECTLY INNOCENT OF COURSE
HE HAS FLED--HAS EVAPORATED ENTIRELY
INTIMIDATED DAZZLED AND WITH IMPEDED RESPIRATION SHE WITHDREW HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ASIDE UNAFFECTED EVEN BY THE NUDGES MONTALAIS GAVE HER WITH HER ELBOW
ONLY ONLY WHAT WELL I CANNOT CARRY IT OUT
COLBERT AND M
FOR THE SECOND TIME HER STRENGTH FORSOOK HER
BUT I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULD ENVY ME
I THEREFORE REPEAT IT
UNDER THE ROYAL OAK YOU WERE SAYING WELL
GOOD HE SAID
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE LETTER IS NOT DATED AND IT IS THAT CIRCUMSTANCE PARTICULARLY WHICH ANNOYS ME
WHAT IS HE WAITING FOR YOU WILL SEE IN A MOMENT MONSIEUR IF YOU WAIT PATIENTLY
AS SOON AS HE HAD GONE THE FRANCISCAN AGAIN TOOK UP THE PAPERS WHICH A CRISIS OF THE FEVER HAD ALREADY ONCE BEFORE OBLIGED HIM TO PUT ASIDE
THAT PERSON THEN WHO IS SPEAKING YONDER TO THOSE MEN WITH TORCHES IN THEIR HANDS IS M
BUT WHEN HE FELT LA VALLIERE'S HANDS CLINGING TO HIS OWN WHEN THEIR WARM PRESSURE FIRED HIS BLOOD HE BENT FORWARD AND PASSING HIS ARM ROUND LA VALLIERE'S WAIST HE RAISED HER FROM THE GROUND AND PRESSED HER AGAINST HIS HEART
NAY PARDON ME COMTE BUT I AM RARELY DECEIVED YOUNG AS I AM
FIVE MINUTES PASSED IN THIS MANNER
REMAIN HERE
AND BESIDES BESIDES SAID THE DUKE NO ONE KNOWS YOU ARE LISTENING TO ME ON THE CONTRARY IT IS KNOWN
MONSIEUR WAS TOO GREAT A PERSONAGE TO NOTICE THESE DETAILS
BUT NOT AT ALL FOR ALL AT ONCE MONSIEUR FOUND ANOTHER PRETEXT
NO NO SHE SAID SIT HERE BY MY SIDE
THE REPAST HAD NOT BEEN OVER-AGREEABLE
EVERY ONE EMBELLISHES IT TO THE UTMOST AND ACCORDING TO HIS OWN FANCY
SHE THEREFORE RESUMED WITH THE AIR OF THE MOST PERFECT CANDOR IN OTHER WORDS WITH THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL HER AIRS
SHE GAVE OUT THEREFORE THAT HER WEALTH WAS GREAT AND AS AN INDUCEMENT FOR OTHERS TO VISIT HER APARTMENTS SHE LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THERE WERE GOOD GOLD CROWNS TO BE WON AT PLAY OR THAT HANDSOME PRESENTS WERE LIKELY TO BE MADE ON DAYS WHEN ALL WENT WELL WITH HER
FONTAINEBLEAU AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
INSTEAD HOWEVER OF TREATING THE SUBJECT WITH THE SAME RESERVE WHICH RAOUL PRACTICED
AND I TRUST THAT THE PROMISES WERE FOLLOWED UP
DE BRAGELONNE IS EVER FREE I WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE FRIENDLY ADVICE WHAT IS THAT TO LOOK AT HIM WELL BEFORE YOU DECIDE IN FAVOR OF M
DE GUICHE FOR INSTANCE HAS HIS VALUE ALSO HE DID NOT DISTINGUISH HIMSELF THIS EVENING SAID MONTALAIS
THE SERVANT HELD OUT A LETTER OF A TRIANGULAR SHAPE
YOU WILL GIVE ME PRESENTLY SOMETHING I WISH FOR I WILL YES YOU WILL
FOR DE GUICHE IT WAS THE DAWN OF UNUTTERABLE HAPPINESS
ON HIS WAY LOUIS MET THE COMTE DE SAINT-AIGNAN
BUT WHY SILENCE SAID DE WARDES
DE GUICHE HOLD THE CHIEF POST OF HONOR IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD WELL REPLIED THE DUKE SOMEWHAT CALMED HAD THIS PASSION OF BUCKINGHAM BEEN REMARKED CERTAINLY VERY WELL
THE TURF WAS DRIED UP FOR WANT OF MOISTURE THE FLOWERS WITHERED
AND HERE I AM AT FONTAINEBLEAU
ROOM MY OWN BOARD A PLACE IN THE STABLE FOR MY HORSE AND HIS FEED
D'ARTAGNAN CAN EASILY BE DISCOVERED AT EITHER OF THOSE TWO PLACES
AND SO HE DID NOT SPARE MADAME A SINGLE WORD OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
MALICORNE PRETENDED TO BE MISTAKEN AND GAVE HIM HIS HAND
MANICAMP WHO WAS LESS INTIMATE WITH HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THAN THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE VAINLY ENDEAVORED TO DETECT FROM THE EXPRESSION OF THE PRINCE'S FACE WHAT HAD MADE HIM SO ILL-HUMORED
HE DISAPPEARED FROM THE COURT LEAVING MONSIEUR MUCH EMBARRASSED
FOUQUET WHO HAS THIS MOMENT ARRIVED BY YOUR MAJESTY'S ORDERS HE SAYS
DE GUICHE AND BUCKINGHAM FORGOT EVERYTHING
THE COMTE DE LA FERE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU CHEVALIER SAID RAOUL
FOUQUET AND YOU INFORMED MY INTENDANT OF COURSE?--SO THAT IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR ARRIVAL BY NO MEANS
WE WILL RECALL HIM
AND FROM THE POSITION IN WHICH HE HAD PLACED HIMSELF OR RATHER WHERE CHANCE HAD PLACED HIM HE SAW NOTHING BUT LOVE AND GARLANDS OF FLOWERS AROUND HIM
WHERE ARE THE NOBLE SENTIMENTS YOU JUST NOW UTTERED
HE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES
MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO-DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY
YES CERTAINLY TO MADAME YOU REMEMBER CONTINUED ARAMIS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MADAME STANDS HIGH IN FAVOR DURING THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS
ARAMIS'S CORRESPONDENCE
IS THAT ALL THE FRANCISCAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE FOR HE COULD NO LONGER SPEAK
PRAY REASSURE YOURSELF
THOSE WHO LOVE ME ARE SUFFICIENTLY HAPPY THAT I DO NOT DISMISS THEM ALTOGETHER
WHEN THE FIFTEEN-FRANC HAS NOT EATEN HIS FOWL OR THE TEN-FRANC HAS LEFT HIS DISH UNFINISHED I SEND IT TO THE FIVE-FRANC PRISONER
ALL WHO WERE PRESENT ASTOUNDED AT THIS CONDUCT WHICH WAS THE VERY REVERSE OF WHAT WAS EXPECTED CONSIDERING THE VIOLENCE OF THE ONE ADVERSARY AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE OTHER BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO CLAP THEIR HANDS AND A THOUSAND CHEERS AND JOYFUL SHOUTS AROSE FROM ALL SIDES
I HAVE PONDERED DEEPLY ON THE MATTER
HOW IS IT LA VALLIERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE THAT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPOKE OF YOU AS LOUISE WE WERE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER REPLIED LOUISE BLUSHING
BUT AS AN AFFECTION HOWEVER RESERVED AND UNPRESUMING IT MAY BE MIGHT POSSIBLY COMPROMISE THE OBJECT OF ITS WORSHIP IT WOULD ILL BECOME A PERSON OF YOUR MERIT RUNNING THE RISK OF BEING COMPROMISED WITHOUT HER FUTURE BEING ASSURED
IF EVER I LOVE I SHALL IMPLORE MY LOVER TO LEAVE ME FREE AND PURE
IT WAS KNOWN ALSO THAT THE KING AFTER HAVING MANIFESTED THE UNEASINESS WITH WHICH MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S HEALTH HAD INSPIRED HIM HAD TURNED PALE AND TREMBLED VERY MUCH AS HE RECEIVED THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL FAINTING INTO HIS ARMS
WE ARE VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO PAYING THE BASTILE A VISIT ADDED THE PRELATE DISPLAYING BENEATH HIS PALE LIPS TEETH WHICH WERE STILL THE SAME BEAUTIFUL TEETH SO MUCH ADMIRED THIRTY YEARS PREVIOUSLY BY MARIE MICHON
LET US SEE WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE DURING THIS MEMORABLE EVENING AT THE KING'S CARD-TABLE
YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR OWN DAY OF DEPARTURE
AND FINALLY WHEN HE HAD ARRIVED IN THE ROOM HE SAID TO THOSE WHO CARRIED HIM
I BEG YOUR PARDON MONSIEUR
THEIR FLATTERY PLEASED AS MUCH AS DE GUICHE'S COURAGE HAD ASTONISHED HIM AND HE SIMPLY REPLIED
WE SHALL NEVER DARE SAY THAT IT IS A SIMPLE JEST
THE KING TERRIFIED CALLED OUT FOR SAINT-AIGNAN
FOUQUET WHO HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT AT THE SAME MOMENT AS MADAME DE BELLIERE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT PLUNGED IN THOUGHT
WHO HAS TOLD YOU THAT SHE AGREES TO RETURN THE KING'S AFFECTION AND WHO HAS TOLD YOU THAT SHE WILL NOT RETURN IT SHE LOVES THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE YOU THINK SO SHE IS EVEN AFFIANCED TO HIM SHE WAS SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN THEY WENT TO ASK THE KING'S PERMISSION TO ARRANGE THE MARRIAGE HE REFUSED HIS PERMISSION REFUSED YES ALTHOUGH THE REQUEST WAS PREFERRED BY THE COMTE DE LA FERE HIMSELF FOR WHOM THE KING HAS THE GREATEST REGARD ON ACCOUNT OF THE PART HE TOOK IN YOUR ROYAL BROTHER'S RESTORATION AND IN OTHER EVENTS ALSO WHICH HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO WELL
COLBERT IT IS NOW TWELVE O'CLOCK HALF-PAST HEIN!_--YOU HAVE A HANDSOME WATCH WHAT WERE YOU SAYING SAID MALICORNE PUTTING HIS WATCH QUICKLY BACK INTO HIS FOB
MALICORNE THIS NAME MADE RAOUL START
THE ONE ABOVE IS THE MORE URGENT THEY CONTINUED THEIR ASCENT
IN THIS PARTICULAR EDITING OF IT LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE
AND LASTLY THE KING WILL BE PUNISHED FOR A CURIOSITY UNWORTHY OF HIS RANK
IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE ONE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF FURY THE OTHER AT THE END OF HIS PATIENCE
WE HAVE ALREADY MADE M
AND IF SHE SHOULD EVER BESTOW HER HEART UPON ANOTHER HAPPY WILL THAT MAN BE TO WHOM SHE CONSECRATES HER FIRST AFFECTIONS MADAME WHO HAD ATTENTIVELY LISTENED TO THE PORTRAIT SAINT-AIGNAN HAD DRAWN AS INDEED HAD ALL THE OTHERS CONTENTED HERSELF WITH ACCENTUATING HER APPROBATION OF THE MOST POETIC PASSAGE BY OCCASIONAL INCLINATIONS OF HER HEAD
WHAT PORTRAIT HE MURMURED JOINING THEM AGAIN
BUT HAS NOT LAST NIGHT REMOVED YOUR ILLUSIONS WHAT ILLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSISTANCE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE ME UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NO
ONLY I HAVE THE HONOR TO REMARK THAT AS THE SEA IS RISING FAST WE HAVE HARDLY TIME BUCKINGHAM MADE A SIGN OF ASSENT TOOK OFF HIS DOUBLET AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND A PROCEEDING WHICH DE WARDES IMITATED
WE NEED TALK NO MORE ON THE SUBJECT THEREFORE
THE YOUNG GIRL WAS PROBABLY IN ATTENDANCE ON MADAME OR WAS IN HER OWN ROOM DRESSING AND HE MAY HAVE HAD TO WAIT
NOBLE SENTIMENTS SAID ATHENAIS WITH AN AIR OF PROTECTION BUT WITH INDIFFERENCE
WE SHALL LIVE TOGETHER ON VERY GOOD TERMS
WHICH IS NOT BAD
IT IS NOW TOO LATE HE SAID
MALICORNE THEN LEFT BLOIS AS WE HAVE SAID AND WENT TO FIND HIS FRIEND MANICAMP THEN IN TEMPORARY RETREAT IN THE CITY OF ORLEANS
DO NOT MIX ME UP IN THE AFFAIR
SO ADIEU MONSIEUR MANICAMP SO FAR SO GOOD
THE YEAR IS NOW 1648 TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE LAST STORY
TO WHOM WAS GIVEN UP WITHOUT A REQUEST FOR IT EVEN A ROOM WHICH SO MANY TRAVELERS WERE DESIROUS OF OBTAINING
THAT IS VERY PALTRY DE GUICHE AND I WILL TELL MADAME OF IT YOU MAY TELL HER WHATEVER YOU PLEASE MONSEIGNEUR FOR HER HIGHNESS CANNOT HATE ME MORE THAN SHE DOES NONSENSE YOU ARE EXAGGERATING
THE FUTURE
I HAVE SAID NOTHING,--I KNOW NOTHING YOU FORGET YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND THOUGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF A WOMAN
FROM WHOM I DO NOT KNOW
IT IS AS COLD AS ICE DE GUICHE KNELT DOWN AND PRESSED TO HIS LIPS NOT ONE BUT BOTH OF MADAME'S HANDS
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IT AND WITH THIS THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HE SHOWED THE KING THE ROOM TO WHICH LA VALLIERE HAD BEEN CARRIED
AS FOR THE SUDDEN PASSION WITH WHICH LOUIS WAS INSPIRED FOR HIS SISTER-IN-LAW PHYSIOLOGY WOULD PERHAPS SUPPLY AN EXPLANATION BY SOME HACKNEYED COMMONPLACE REASONS AND NATURE BY MEANS OF HER MYSTERIOUS AFFINITY OF CHARACTERS
AND A LARGE APARTMENT FOR MYSELF
MONSIEUR PALE WITH ANGER AGAIN DESCENDED TOWARDS THE QUEEN'S APARTMENTS AND PENETRATED AS FAR AS ANNE OF AUSTRIA'S ORATORY WHERE HE PERCEIVED THROUGH THE HALF-OPENED TAPESTRY-HANGINGS HIS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL SISTER ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE QUEEN-MOTHER WHO APPEARED WEEPING BITTERLY
WHEN MUST I LEAVE
SOMEWHAT HEAVY MONSIEUR YOU SEE SAID DE GUICHE TO THE SADDLER THIS GENTLEMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THESE MATTERS WELL THINKS THE HOLSTERS HEAVY A COMPLAINT I HAD ALREADY MADE THE SADDLER WAS FULL OF EXCUSES
HE BOWED IN RETURN SAYING YOU DO ME A VERY GREAT HONOR MONSIEUR LE COMTE WHOM HAVE I THE PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING MY NAME IS MALICORNE MONSIEUR M
YOU SAY YES LIKE A NO SHE HAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES YES BUT SMALL THAT IS SO BUT THEY ARE BRILLIANT
MADAME WAITED FOR HIM TO SPEAK ABOUT LA VALLIERE FIRST
DE GUICHE HAD HOPED THAT THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM WOULD ACCOMPANY THE ADMIRAL TO ENGLAND
I HAVE A GREAT MANY THINGS TO SAY TO YOU OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE STILL MONTALAIS SAID SAINT-AIGNAN TO HIMSELF ONE OF THE THREE
HAPPY ENOUGH IN HAVING HAD HER FATE UNITED TO YOUR OWN SHE WEEPINGLY IMPLORES HEAVEN TO PRESERVE YOU TO HER AND IS JEALOUS OF THE FAINTEST THROB OF YOUR HEART BESTOWED ELSEWHERE THE KING AGAIN SEEMED ANXIOUS TO SPEAK BUT AGAIN DID LA VALLIERE VENTURE TO PREVENT HIM.--"WOULD IT NOT THEREFORE BE A MOST BLAMABLE ACTION SHE CONTINUED IF YOUR MAJESTY A WITNESS OF THIS ANXIOUS AND DISINTERESTED AFFECTION GAVE THE QUEEN ANY CAUSE FOR JEALOUSY
MONSIEUR DELIGHTED WITH HIS BATH OF THE TWO PREVIOUS DAYS HAD ANNOUNCED HIS PREFERENCE FOR THE RIVER AND HAVING GIVEN DE GUICHE LEAVE OF ABSENCE REMAINED AT THE CHATEAU WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE AND MANICAMP
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID MALICORNE TIMIDLY
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE WOULD BE THOUGHT OF A BISHOP IN MY PRESENT COSTUME PRAY EXCUSE ME I HAD FORGOTTEN
AMID THESE VARIED POLITICAL AND AMOROUS INTERESTS MALICORNE WAS ANXIOUS TO GAIN MONTALAIS'S ATTENTION
WHAT I ASK YOU--FOR EVERYTHING WILL DEPEND UPON THAT--IS WHETHER THERE IS OR IS NOT ANY SECRET I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS ANY SECRET SAID LA VALLIERE
I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO HAVE SOME TERRIER DOGS SENT ME FROM ENGLAND TO KILL THE RATS
AND IS THERE A REPETITION OF THE BALLET THIS EVENING CERTAINLY ARE YOU SURE QUITE RETURNED THE CHEVALIER
MY DEAR BOY SAID BAISEMEAUX ENDEAVORING TO SMILE I HAVE BROUGHT YOU A DIVERSION AND AN EXTRA,--THE ONE FOR THE MIND THE OTHER FOR THE BODY
I SWORE AND GOD AND THE DEAD WERE WITNESSES TO MY OATH
HOW WAS HE WONDERFULLY WELL AND WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM M
DE GUICHE IS GUILTY HE HAS DISPLEASED ME THAT IS YOUR OWN AFFAIR VERY WELL I KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO SAID THE PRINCE IMPETUOUSLY
GET MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS TO COME DOWN SAID THE KING AND DO NOT BREATHE A WORD TO HER OF MY VISIT MALICORNE BOWED IN TOKEN OF OBEDIENCE AND PROCEEDED UP THE STAIRCASE
DE WARDES WENT FORWARD IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHERS
PERHAPS HE SAID
WELL OR ILL MATTERS LITTLE
THE HOUSES ARE ALL TAKEN BY WHOM BY THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID GUICHE WHOSE ATTENTION THIS NAME HAD AWAKENED
OCCUPIED IN THIS MANNER HE DID NOT REMARK HOW DISTURBED HIS GUEST HAD BECOME
BUT I RETURN TO MY BREVET AND YOU ARE WRONG PROVE ME THAT MY FRIEND THERE WILL ONLY BE TWELVE MAIDS OF HONOR FOR MADAME
MY FRIEND THE COMTE DE LA FERE HAS ACQUAINTED ME WITH THE INJURIOUS REPORTS YOU ARE SPREADING ABOUT MYSELF
CAN I NOT READ YOUR HEART IF YOU KNOW MY HEART THEN CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT IT IS MY HEART I OFFER YOU I HAVE GUESSED RIGHTLY THEN EXCLAIMED FOUQUET
THIS FIGURE CANNOT BE PERFORMED SINCE M
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IF THESE MARKS OF ASSENT WERE ACCORDED TO THE ABILITY OF THE NARRATOR OF THE RESEMBLANCE OF THE PORTRAIT
WHEN DE GUICHE'S AFFAIRS WHICH HAD BEEN SUDDENLY SET TO RIGHT WITHOUT HIS HAVING BEEN ABLE TO GUESS THE CAUSE OF THEIR IMPROVEMENT ASSUMED THE UNEXPECTED ASPECT WE HAVE SEEN RAOUL IN OBEDIENCE TO THE REQUEST OF THE PRINCESS HAD WITHDRAWN IN ORDER NOT TO INTERRUPT AN EXPLANATION THE RESULTS OF WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM GUESSING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT YOU SEE YOUR HIGHNESS I HAVE ALREADY DISPLEASED YOU
THE LARGE APARTMENT WOULD SERVE FOR THE RECEPTION IN A BEFITTING MANNER OF A LADY THICKLY VEILED RESERVING TO THE LADY IN QUESTION A DOUBLE MEANS OF EXIT EITHER IN A STREET SOMEWHAT DESERTED OR CLOSELY ADJOINING THE FOREST
YOU WILL DO AND SAY THIS M
THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAD GIVEN A NEW EXPANSION TO THE NUMEROUS IDEAS GERMINATING IN HIS FERTILE BRAIN WAS THAT HE HAD JUST PERCEIVED THAT MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WAS LIKE HIMSELF DRESSED IN ROSE-COLOR
IF WE JEST AT THEM WHAT WILL OUR SERVANTS DO HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT SAID DE WARDES WHOSE EARS TINGLED AT THE REMARK
MONSIEUR MALICORNE DON'T LET US BE ANGRY
NEVER UNTIL NOW HAD SHE LOOKED AT HER JEWELS EXCEPT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A SELECTION ACCORDING TO THEIR SETTINGS OR THEIR COLORS
THE DEUCE TAKE THE SIMPLETON WHO OUGHT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO ME ABOUT MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE AND YET HE WRITES SUCH SILLY STUFF AS THAT
DO NOT SHRUG YOUR SHOULDERS MY DEAR COMTE
BY THE BY WHAT ARE YOU QUICK AT MAKING VERSES WONDERFULLY SO WILL YOU HAVE QUITE FINISHED THE THREE LINES AND A HALF TO-MORROW MORNING I HOPE SO ADIEU THEN UNTIL TO-MORROW ADIEU ADIEU SAINT-AIGNAN WAS OBLIGED TO ACCEPT THE NOTICE TO QUIT
AND AFTER HAVING SHOWN THE TWO RECEIPTS TO BAISEMEAUX HE DESTROYED THEM
FROM THE LITTLE OPEN SPACE WHERE THE HALT HAD TAKEN PLACE THREE BEAUTIFUL LONG WALKS SHADY AND UNDULATING STRETCHED OUT BEFORE THEM
WILL YOU PLACE YOURS WITHIN IT BUT YOUR FATHER MY FATHER LEAVES ME PERFECTLY FREE YET I UNDERSTAND YOUR SCRUPLES LOUISE
THE SAILORS WERE JUST IN TIME TO CATCH HOLD OF HIM TO STEADY THEMSELVES
GENTLEMEN ADIEU
BUT AS ALL THE NECESSARY DIRECTIONS HAD BEEN GIVEN RESPECTING THE PROMENADE AND EVERY PREPARATION HAD BEEN MADE ACCORDINGLY AND AS WHICH WAS FAR MORE IMPERIOUS THAN ANYTHING ELSE LOUIS RELIED UPON THIS PROMENADE TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS IMAGINATION AND WE WILL EVEN ALREADY SAY THE CLAMOROUS DESIRES OF HIS HEART--THE KING UNHESITATINGLY DECIDED THAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE HEAVENS HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE MATTER
I WILL WRITE AT YOUR DICTATION
THE APPOINTMENT WILL BE AN EXPENSIVE ONE FOR ME IN THAT CASE REPLIED THE PRINCE LAUGHING
SHE GATHERED BESIDES THIS HAPPY BELIEF FROM THE GLANCES OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER
STATE IT THEN DO YOU KNOW WHO HAS JUST BEEN NOMINATED CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF THE MUSKETEERS?--AN APPOINTMENT MORE VALUABLE THAN A PEERAGE
IS THAT YOU DE GUICHE
MONSIEUR RADIANT WITH DELIGHT MADE A THOUSAND AFFECTIONATE SIGNS TO HIS MOTHER
BUT IT IS NOT THE SACRIFICE OF ONE ONLY OF THE TWO PERSONS THUS UNITED
AND DE GUICHE ON HIS PART NEVER HAVING BEEN QUESTIONED DID NOT COMMUNICATE ANY PARTICULARS TO ME BUT MANICAMP IT IS TRUE I SAW MANICAMP AT LE HAVRE AND DURING THE JOURNEY HERE BUT I WAS NO MORE INQUISITIVE WITH HIM THAN I HAD BEEN TOWARDS DE GUICHE
HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HOME AND ALTAR WHAT DID YOU SAY SAID THE DUKE HAUGHTILY THOROUGHLY ROUSED BY THIS INSIDIOUS JEST
CAN YOU TELL ME MONSIEUR WHO DOES NOT KNOW HIM THOSE WHO DO KNOW HIM MONSIEUR REPLIED RAOUL WITH STILL GREATER CALMNESS AND STERNNESS OF MANNER ARE IN THE HABIT OF SAYING THAT IF HE IS NOT AS GOOD A GENTLEMAN AS THE KING--WHICH IS NOT HIS FAULT--HE IS THE EQUAL OF ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH IN COURAGE AND LOYALTY
SHE HOWEVER DID NOT BESTOW A SINGLE GLANCE UPON HIM
IN FACT HARDLY HAD THE SOUND OF THE RINGS DRAWN ALONG THE CURTAIN-RODS ANNOUNCED THAT MADAME WAS DRESSED AND THAT THE GODDESS WAS ABOUT TO MAKE HER REAPPEARANCE THAN THE KING RETURNING TO HIS FORMER POST IMMEDIATELY AND RUNNING QUITE CLOSE TO THE RIVER-BANK GAVE THE SIGNAL FOR ALL THOSE TO APPROACH WHOSE DUTY OR PLEASURE SUMMONED THEM TO MADAME'S SIDE
BUT ALL AT ONCE HE LET FALL HIS HAT SEIZED THE YOUNG GIRL BY THE SHOULDERS PULLED HER TOWARDS HIM AND SEALED HER MOUTH WITH TWO LIPS THAT WERE VERY WARM FOR A MAN PRETENDING TO SO MUCH INDIFFERENCE
NO MORDIOUX AND AS YOUR MAJESTY SAYS I HAD A COMPANION AND A GOOD COMPANION TOO A YOUNG MAN YES SIRE
THE BRILLIANT DISPLAY OF HORSES ARMS AND RICH LIVERIES AFFORDED SOME COMPENSATION IN THOSE TIMES THANKS TO THE KINDLY FEELINGS OF THE PEOPLE AND TO THE TRADITIONS OF DEEP DEVOTION TO THEIR SOVEREIGNS FOR THE ENORMOUS EXPENSES CHARGED UPON THE TAXES
WHAT PHYSICIANS HAVE YOU AT FONTAINEBLEAU HE INQUIRED AFTER A LONG PAUSE
AS SOON AS MADAME ALIGHTED SHE FOUND THE COMTE DE GUICHE AT HER SIDE WHO BOWED AND PLACED HIMSELF AT HER DISPOSAL
DE BRAGELONNE I WELL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE FELLOW-TRAVELERS ONCE AND THAT I REMARKED YOUR EXTREME PRUDENCE IN THE MIDST OF THE EXTRAVAGANT ABSURDITIES COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES BY TWO OF THE GREATEST SIMPLETONS IN THE WORLD,--M
THEY CARRIED THEIR DESPAIR AWAY WITH THEM IN THEIR HEARTS LIKE A PRICELESS POSSESSION BECAUSE THE DESPAIR WAS CAUSED BY THE WOMAN THEY LOVED AND BECAUSE DEATH THUS DECEPTIVE WAS LIKE A GIFT OF A FAVOR CONFERRED UPON THEM BUCKINGHAM ROSE HIS FEATURES DISTORTED AND HIS HANDS PRESSED AGAINST HIS HEART
I BELONG TO A FAMILY WHOSE LOYALTY HAS BEEN PROVED SIRE AND I TOO LOVE MY KING SUDDENLY HER STRENGTH VOICE AND RESPIRATION CEASED AND SHE FELL FORWARD LIKE THE FLOWER VIRGIL ALLUDES TO WHICH THE SCYTHE OF THE REAPER SEVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE GRASS
YOU IMPLORE ME CERTAINLY
I NEED NOT ASK IF YOU WROTE TO HIM IN A SIMILAR STYLE HE WILL SHOW YOU MY LETTER WHEN YOU CALL ON HIM ON MY BEHALF BUT THAT IS ALMOST OUT OF THE QUESTION WHAT IS THAT I SHALL CALL ON HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE WHY SO THE DUKE CONSULTS ME AS YOU DO I SUPPOSE YOU WILL GIVE ME THE PREFERENCE
IS IT TRUE MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE THE PERFECT TRUTH REPLIED ATHENAIS IN A VOICE QUITE AS FIRM BUT NOT YET SO DISTINCT
THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS DEAREST THAT I HAVE NO LODGING WHO CAN THIS FRANCISCAN BE SAID MONTALAIS
WHILE THIS IS TECHNICALLY TRUE THERE'S ANOTHER BOOK TWENTY YEARS AFTER THAT COMES BETWEEN
THIS IS POSITIVE REBELLION MADAME RECEIVED ME TOO INDIFFERENTLY YESTERDAY BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT REALLY SAID THE PRINCE LAUGHING
LA VALLIERE IS A CHARMING GIRL SLIGHTLY LAME AH
A MAN NEVER LOVES WITH IDOLATRY UNLESS HE FEELS SURE HE IS LOVED IN RETURN
HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING AND TREMBLED AS HE REFLECTED ON THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS AND THE STATE OF THE MINDS OF THOSE ABOUT HIM
WHAT SIRE SAID THE SECOND FIGURE ADVANCING TIMIDLY HAS YOUR MAJESTY PUT OUR YOUNG SENTIMENTALISTS TO FLIGHT IT SEEMS SO SAID THE KING AND YOU CAN SHOW YOURSELF WITHOUT FEAR TAKE CARE SIRE YOU WILL BE RECOGNIZED BUT I TELL YOU THEY ARE FLOWN THIS IS A MOST FORTUNATE MEETING SIRE
AT VULAINES BENEATH THE IMPENETRABLE SHADE OF FLOWERING OSIERS AND WILLOWS WHICH AS THEY BENT DOWN THEIR GREEN HEADS DIPPED THE EXTREMITIES OF THEIR BRANCHES IN THE BLUE WATERS A LONG AND FLAT-BOTTOMED BOAT WITH LADDERS COVERED WITH LONG BLUE CURTAINS SERVED AS A REFUGE FOR THE BATHING DIANAS WHO AS THEY LEFT THE WATER WERE WATCHED BY TWENTY PLUMED ACTEONS WHO EAGERLY AND FULL OF ADMIRATION GALLOPED UP AND DOWN THE FLOWERY BANKS OF THE RIVER
TAKE CARE MONSIEUR SAID BRAGELONNE TRANQUILLY OR YOU WILL PUT OUT ONE OF MY EYES YOU WILL NOT FIGHT THEN SAID DE WARDES
YOU UPON THIS MISERABLE BED
YOUR MAJESTY OVERWHELMS ME AND SINCE YOU ARE SO GRACIOUSLY DISPOSED TOWARDS ME WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO REMIND YOU OF THE PROMISE MADE TO GRANT AN AUDIENCE AH YES
A DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
YOU TURNED THE CREDULITY OF A YOUNG MAN INTO RIDICULE--IT WAS VERY NATURAL TO DO SO
IN FACT ALL ALONG THE COAST SAID ARAMIS QUIETLY
THE FOLIAGE WAS PUSHED ASIDE AND SAINT-AIGNAN APPEARED WITH A SMILE ON HIS LIPS AND HIS HAND STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS THEM TAKING EVERY ONE BY SURPRISE
THE PAGES HURRIED FORWARD CONDUCTING THE LED HORSES
IF YOU WISH TO DINE WITHOUT ME YOU HAVE YOUR LADIES
SHE WISHED TO KNOW IF THE KING WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE ROYAL OAK
I WOULD FOLLOW YOUR HIGHNESS TO THE END OF THE WORLD CLUMSY FELLOW THAT YOU ARE SAID MANICAMP GRUMBLINGLY PUSHING HIS HORSE TOWARDS DE GUICHE SO AS ALMOST TO UNSEAT HIM AND THEN AS HE PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AS IF HE HAD LOST COMMAND OVER THE HORSE HE WHISPERED FOR GOODNESS SAKE THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WELL IT IS AGREED THEN SAID THE PRINCE
MANY HATS TOO HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY BY THE WAVES
BESIDES IN POINT OF FACT WHAT CAN BE MORE NATURAL
BRAGELONNE THEREFORE COLLECTING ALL HIS COURAGE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE MONSIEUR YOU CAN HAVE ANY REASON TO REJECT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
VERY WELL MONSIEUR DE WOSTPUR YOU WILL RECEIVE A REPLY
THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE ETEXT 2609
IF HE PREFERS THE APARTMENT I WILL BE SATISFIED WITH THE ROOM I AM EXCEEDINGLY DISTRESSED MONSIEUR SAID THE TRAVELER IN HIS SOFT VOICE BUT I NEED BOTH THE ROOM AND THE APARTMENT AT LEAST TELL ME FOR WHOM INQUIRED MALICORNE
BUT WHETHER SHE DID OR DID NOT OBSERVE HIS SALUTATIONS THE PRINCESS DID NOT EVEN TURN HER HEAD
WATCH WAS IMPATIENTLY KEPT FROM THE DIFFERENT LOOK-OUTS
GO AND DRESS YOURSELF DE GUICHE AND COME BACK FOR ME
ON YOUR ARRIVAL FOLLOW THE CHEVALIER'S ADVICE IF YOU LIKE
THE RESULT WAS THAT BLOWS DID NOT BECOME DEADENED UPON HER AS UPON WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED THE COTTON-WADDED FEELINGS OF MARIA THERESA
MALICORNE WHO HAD ARRIVED THE PREVIOUS DAY RIDING AN ILL-CONDITIONED HORSE WITH A SLENDER VALISE HAD ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AT THE HOTEL OF THE BEAU PAON AS THE FRIEND OF A NOBLEMAN DESIROUS OF WITNESSING THE FETES AND WHO WOULD HIMSELF ARRIVE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
SHE WAS YOUNG A COQUETTE AND ARDENTLY FOND OF ADMIRATION
COME SIRE I AM A FOOL!--MY DISCHARGE SIRE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID LOUIS LEANING HIS WHITE HAND UPON THE DUSTY ARM OF THE MUSKETEER WHAT I TELL YOU WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT THAT WHICH I PROMISED YOU
DO YOU THREATEN ME IN THE MIDST OF MY COMPLAINTS I DO NOT THREATEN YOU
CORAM ISTO INQUIRED THE SPANISH CARDINAL
BETWEEN DE GUICHE AND HIMSELF A VIGOROUS CONTEST ENSUED INVARIABLY A COURTEOUS ONE IN WHICH IN ORDER TO INSURE SUCCESS THE DUKE WAS READY TO SPEND A MILLION
ROYAL PSYCHOLOGY
THE KING HAD RESOLVED TO MAKE IT SURPRISE
COLBERT HATE M
IN THIS WAY THE JOURNEY WHICH WAS PERFORMED BY SHORT STAGES WAS MOST AGREEABLE AND BUCKINGHAM ALMOST A FRENCHMAN FROM WIT AND EDUCATION WAS DELIGHTED AT HAVING SO ADMIRABLY SELECTED HIS TRAVELING COMPANION
IT WOULD BE SAFER TO CONFER MORE IN PRIVATE IF YOU WOULD GRANT ME SUCH A FAVOR BAISEMEAUX YOU SEEM TO FORGET WE ARE ACQUAINTANCES OF FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS STANDING
DE BAISEMEAUX SAID ARAMIS YOU ARE ALWAYS FORGETTING NO
ON HIS WAY OUT HE MET MONTALAIS WHO WAS IN ATTENDANCE IN THE ANTE-ROOM
NAY YOU ARE WEEPING
EVERYBODY IS AWAY EITHER AT MASS WITH THE KING OR BATHING WITH MONSIEUR AT THE END OF THE WALK THE YOUNG GIRLS PERCEIVED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BENEATH THE ARCHING TREES THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE AND NOBLE STATURE OF A YOUNG MAN WHO WITH HIS SWORD UNDER HIS ARM AND A CLOAK THROWN ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS BOOTED AND SPURRED BESIDES SALUTED THEM FROM THE DISTANCE WITH A GENTLE SMILE
AND THEREFORE HE WALKED BEHIND
DE VANNES SAID THE KING I WILL PUNISH M
NAY I AM SURE OF IT AND I WOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM GO UNTIL HE HAD TOLD ME THE TRUTH THERE IS STILL TIME
DE WARDES ON SHORE THEY TOOK HIM IN THEIR ARMS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE DRY SAND WHERE THE TIDE NEVER ROSE SO HIGH
YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME IN THIS MANNER WHY REALLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS NOW TIME TO RETURN TO OUR APARTMENTS AND YET YOU WERE NOT GOING IN WHEN I--DID NOT MEET BUT FOUND YOU THEREFORE MY DEAR COMTE SAID DE GUICHE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME I PLACE MYSELF ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE AND YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT IN DOING SO
MAKE HASTE THEREFORE M
THE KING'S NAME WAS FIRST ON THE LIST NEXT THE QUEEN-MOTHER THEN THE QUEEN MONSIEUR MADAME AND SO ON
HE WAS THEN INFORMED THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN READINESS AND THAT THEY ONLY WAITED FOR HIM WHENEVER HE WOULD BE DISPOSED TO EMBARK WITH THE FRENCH GENTLEMAN
YOUR DEVOTED VILLIERS DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM I AM GOING NOW TO SEE YOUR MASTER SAID RAOUL TO DE GUICHE'S SERVANT AS HE DISMISSED HIM
MONSIEUR SHE REPLIED I WAS NOT AWARE WHEN I CAME TO THE COURT OF FRANCE THAT PRINCESSES OF MY RANK WERE TO BE REGARDED AS THE WOMEN IN TURKEY ARE
THEN LA VALLIERE WHO IS IN LOVE WITH THE KING
I AGAIN PUT MY QUESTION TO M
IS SHE WELL BORN EXCELLENTLY
HE WILL WAIT UNTIL HE IS PROVOKED AND IN THAT CASE HIS POSITION IS A GOOD ONE
I DISCUSS IT BEFORE MEN OF HONOR ALL OF WHOM HAVE MORE THAN ONCE HAD THEIR SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS IN AFFAIRS OF HONOR
WHEN DO YOU NEED THIS SUM TO-MORROW MORNING
YOU ARE A LEARNED MAN MONSIEUR GRISART AND THAT CONFERS AN HONOR UPON US ALL
A WOMAN'S EYE CAN READ THE FACE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES ITS EVERY FEELING OF PRIDE ITS EVERY EXPRESSION OF SUFFERING
COLBERT SAID HE ACCENTUATING THE FINANCIER'S NAME THAT IS NOT THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD THE MATTER
I TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN INSCRIBED ON OUR BOOKS THRICE IN THE SPACE OF TWO YEARS I MUST SEE IT BEFORE I BELIEVE IT SAID ARAMIS
THEN WHEN SHE HAD ADVANCED A FEW STEPS WITH THE RAPIDITY OF A WOMAN WHO FEARS RECOGNITION AND WHEN THE CHEVALIER PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS TO TROUBLE HERSELF ABOUT HIM HE DARTED INTO THE GARDEN LOOKED HASTILY ROUND ON EVERY SIDE AND EMBRACED WITHIN HIS GLANCE AS MUCH OF THE HORIZON AS HE POSSIBLY COULD
WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
BAH
BAH
BAH
TO BE A MINISTER--TO BE A SLAVE,--NEVER
PERCEIVING THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHOSE RANK SHE COULD NOT TELL HER CRIES FOR ASSISTANCE WERE REDOUBLED
MADAME WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT LAUGH AND THE KING WENT TO HER IN ORDER TO MAKE HER LAUGH TOO SO THAT SO THAT NOTHING IS ALTERED IN THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE DAY SAID THE CHEVALIER
ONE MAY BE A KING AND YET FEEL THAT HE POSSESSES FEWER CHANCES OF PLEASING THAN MANY OTHER GENTLEMEN I AM SURE SIRE THAT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD YOU ARE SAYING THE KING LOOKED AT MADAME TENDERLY AND SAID WILL YOU PROMISE ME ONE THING WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER WASTE UPON STRANGERS IN YOUR OWN APARTMENTS THE TIME WHICH YOU OWE US
IN EVERY AND ANY CASE THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT AT THIS SCENE HAD AT FIRST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF UNEASINESS
SHE WAS SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER REVERIE THAT THE KING ENTERED WITHOUT HER PERCEIVING HIM
THAT IS RATHER TRYING I WARN YOU THE DEVIL YOU MUST GET OUT OF BED AND GO IMMEDIATELY TO M
MARIA THERESA ACCOMPANIED MADAME IN HER CARRIAGE AND ASKED THE KING IN WHAT DIRECTION HE WISHED THE PROMENADE TO DRIVE
ON THAT DAY THEN IF THAT DAY SHOULD EVER DAWN SAID ARAMIS TRANQUILLY WE WILL THINK OVER A MEANS OF DISPENSING WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OR OF BRAVING THE DISLIKE OF M
DE GUICHE'S EXILE
COME MONSEIGNEUR COME I CANNOT
THE PRINCESS PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HIM WHILE THE QUEEN TURNED ASIDE HER HEAD AND THE ADMIRAL LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT THE SOUND OF WHICH BUCKINGHAM SEEMED READY TO SPRING UPON HIM
RAOUL SPOKE ENGLISH PERFECTLY AND CONSTITUTED HIMSELF HIS FRIEND'S INTERPRETER WITH THE YOUNG ENGLISH NOBLEMEN WHO WERE INDIFFERENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
DE GUICHE IS ALWAYS IN HER APARTMENTS--ALWAYS WITH HER THE QUEEN CLAPPED HER HANDS TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH
MADAME FROM THAT EVENING ACHIEVED AND ENJOYED A SUCCESS CAPABLE OF BEWILDERING ALL NOT BORN TO THOSE ALTITUDES TERMED THRONES
SUCH INDEED WERE MADAME'S REFLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE KING
THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS DESIRED HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS'S PHYSICIAN TO BE SENT FOR
REALLY MONSIEUR I SHOULD REGARD YOU AS A COWARD AND A TRAITOR TOO IF I DID NOT WITH GREATER JUSTICE REGARD YOU AS A MADMAN MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED DE WARDES EXASPERATED I WAS DECEIVED I FIND IN TERMING YOU A PEDAGOGUE
I DID NOT SAY AND WHICH I AM FORCED TO MAKE
EVERY MATHEMATICIAN EVERY POET AND EVERY DREAMER HAS HIS OWN SUBJECTS OF INTEREST
WHO WOULD THINK AFTER THE CHASTISEMENT THAT TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS HAD SUFFERED OF ENDEAVORING TO SURPRISE WHAT IS PASSING IN THE HEART OF SHEPHERDESSES
NOW WE HAVE RETURNED TO OUR PROPER SENSES SHALL WE SAY ADIEU SIRE ALAS
IN OTHER WORDS AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID AND I SAY IT AGAIN THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL COQUETTES OH
DO NOT CALL OUT HER NAME
SHE WAS PRESENTED TO THE QUEENS
AN INVINCIBLE ATTRACTION DREW HIM TOWARDS THE PRINCESS
LOVERS FLUTTER FROM ONE TO ANOTHER
TWO OF HER MAIDS OF HONOR DRESSED AS HAMADRYADS SEEING DE GUICHE ADVANCE DREW BACK OUT OF RESPECT WHEREUPON DE GUICHE PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE AND SALUTED HER ROYAL HIGHNESS
LIKE THE CARRIAGE THEY BELONGED TO THE EARLIER PART OF THE CENTURY
HE HURRIEDLY SEIZED HOLD OF THE PAPERS WHICH WERE LYING ABOUT AND WITH HIS LONG AND BONY HAND CONCEALED THEM UNDER THE CUSHIONS OF THE CHAIR
AND IT WAS PRECISELY THAT WHICH HAD ANNOYED HIS MAJESTY
HE BOWED COURTEOUSLY TO THE YOUNG QUEEN AND HIS MOTHER BUT SALUTED MADAME ALMOST CAVALIERLY
I KNOW VERY WELL THAT M
YOU ARE VERY KIND TO HAVE COME HE SAID TO GUICHE I FEARED YOU WOULD LEAVE WITHOUT BIDDING ME ADIEU YOUR HIGHNESS KNOWS ME TOO WELL TO BELIEVE ME CAPABLE OF SO GREAT A DISRESPECT BESIDES I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK FROM ME BEFORE LEAVING PARIS YOUR HIGHNESS HAS INDEED GUESSED CORRECTLY FOR I HAVE A REQUEST TO MAKE VERY GOOD WHAT IS IT THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE IMMEDIATELY DISPLAYED THE GREATEST ATTENTION FOR HE REGARDED EVERY FAVOR CONFERRED UPON ANOTHER AS A ROBBERY COMMITTED AGAINST HIMSELF
ARE YOU DRUNK BELOW THERE
SHUT YOUR EYES SO AS NOT TO SEE THE EXAMPLES BEFORE YOU
BUT YOU REGARD ME IN THE LIGHT OF A TRUE FRIEND
WHILST THE WAX-LIGHTS WERE BURNING IN THE CASTLE OF BLOIS AROUND THE INANIMATE BODY OF GASTON OF ORLEANS THAT LAST REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PAST
D'ARTAGNAN IS EXCEEDINGLY SKILLFUL AND I WILL BEG HIM AS A FAVOR TO TREAT YOU AS HE DID YOUR FATHER
I PUT THE QUESTION TO YOU WITH AN EXCELLENT REASON SINCE POETS PRETEND THAT IN ORDER TO SOFTEN MONSIEUR CERBERUS THE VISITOR MUST TAKE SOMETHING ENTICING WITH HIM--A CAKE FOR INSTANCE
DE GUICHE COME EXPLAIN YOURSELF DE GUICHE
WHY THE KING
SHE IS NOT ONLY ATTRACTED BY NOVELTY SHE IS UTTERLY OBLIVIOUS AND IS WITHOUT FAITH
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FRANCE SHE SAID IN FRENCH
REDEEM THE PAPERS FOR A SUM OF MONEY PAID DOWN OR IN CASE OF REFUSAL STOP THE PENSION--BUT RUN NO RISK I WILL QUICKLY DECIDE WHAT IS BEST TO BE DONE SAID ARAMIS
AT ALL EVENTS HE OBSERVED I HAVE NO PERSONAL ILL-WILL TOWARDS M
SINCE MONSIEUR DE MAZARIN'S DEATH FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OCCASION SOME LITTLE FATIGUE AND EMBARRASSMENT
SHE IS TALL AND OF A GOOD FIGURE I FANCY SHE STOOPS A LITTLE MY LORD I DO NOT DENY IT
DE GUICHE DRESSED AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED LOOKED SO HANDSOME THAT HE EXCITED EVERY ONE'S OBSERVATION
SHE ASKED HERSELF WHAT MADAME DE CHEVREUSE WOULD HAVE ADVISED HER TO DO IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR MUTUAL DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM THEIR INTRIGUES
DE GUICHE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS LIPS TO EXPRESS HIS THANKS WHEN THE KING SAID COMTE THIS IS THE SEASON FOR FARMING PURPOSES IN THE COUNTRY
BUT RAOUL WAS ONE AMONG OTHERS EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER IN THIS ART SO MUCH A MATTER OF ETIQUETTE THAT FROM THE MOVEMENT OF THE LIPS HE WAS OFTEN ABLE TO GUESS THE SENSE OF THE WORDS
HERE IS THE BREVET SAID SHE
THE BARON APPROACHED THE BED AND WISHED TO SPEAK BUT THE HAND OF THE FRANCISCAN IMPOSED SILENCE UPON HIM
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FEW WORDS HE HAD SAID ABOUT THE FRANCISCAN FRIAR MALICORNE HAD NOT GIVEN ANY PARTICULARS ABOUT THE TRAVELERS WHO WERE STAYING IN THE INN
AS THE GOVERNOR ENTERED THE YOUNG MAN TURNED HIS HEAD WITH A LOOK FULL OF INDIFFERENCE
DE GUICHE I NAME NO ONE THIS IS ABSURD
YOU HAVE LOST AS USUAL INQUIRED ARAMIS HIS PEN STILL IN HIS HAND
DO NOT BE UNEASY ON THAT SCORE AS YOU PLEASE MY LORD
AND SHE TOLD ME WITHOUT SUSPECTING ANYTHING THAT A LITTLE WHILE AGO SHE WAS UNDER THE GREAT OAK WITH HER TWO FRIENDS WHEN THE SOUND OF A WOLF OR A ROBBER HAD TERRIFIED THEM AND MADE THEM RUN AWAY BUT INQUIRED THE KING ANXIOUSLY WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF THESE TWO FRIENDS SIRE SAID SAINT-AIGNAN WILL YOUR MAJESTY SEND ME FORTHWITH TO THE BASTILE WHAT FOR BECAUSE I AM AN EGOTIST AND A FOOL
THEN SUDDENLY HE SAID M
FOUQUET LED THE WAY FOLLOWED BY ARAMIS
MOREOVER SHE LAUGHED SO HEARTILY WHILE SHE WAS TELLING ME HER STORY THAT IN PURSUANCE OF THAT MEDICAL AXIOM THAT LAUGHTER IS THE FINEST PHYSIC IN THE WORLD I ASK PERMISSION TO LAUGH A LITTLE MYSELF WHEN I RECOLLECT HER WORDS THE KING AND SAINT-AIGNAN WHO NOTICED SPREADING OVER MANY OF THE FACES PRESENT A DISTANT AND PROPHETIC RIPPLE OF THE LAUGHTER MADAME ANNOUNCED FINISHED BY LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AS IF ASKING THEMSELVES WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME LITTLE CONSPIRACY CONCEALED BENEATH THESE WORDS
HE HEARD WHISPERS THE COMPLAINING TONES OF A WOMAN'S VOICE MINGLED WITH ENTREATIES SMOTHERED LAUGHTER SIGHS AND HALF-STILTED EXCLAMATIONS OF SURPRISE
AT THIS MOMENT THE KING FLOATED BETWEEN THE JOY THE LAST WORDS OF FOUQUET HAD GIVEN HIM AND HIS PLEASURE AT THE RETURN OF D'ARTAGNAN
THEN SUDDENLY STARTING BACK HE TURNED PALE AND SANK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR CONCEALING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
THEN AGAIN IT IS NOT DE WARDES I REQUIRE SO MUCH AS THAT SOME EVENT OR ANOTHER SHOULD HAPPEN
WHAT IS THE SECRET THEN A MURDER WAS COMMITTED IN THAT HOUSE NONSENSE BUT ATTEND
THE POPE IS CONSPIRING AGAINST THE ORDER SAID THE MONK
BOTH WERE PRACTICED SWORDSMEN AND THE EARLIER PASSES WERE WITHOUT ANY RESULT
D'HERBLAY OF COURSE OF COURSE EXCLAIMED BAISEMEAUX DELIGHTEDLY
THE COURTIER WHO HELD THEM AT THE MOMENT THE KING MADE THIS REMARK AMIDST THE GENERAL AGITATION HASTENED TO PLACE THE BRACELETS IN THE HANDS OF THE QUEEN MARIA THERESA WHO KNOWING TOO WELL POOR WOMAN THAT THEY WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR HER HARDLY LOOKED AT THEM AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY PASSED THEM ON TO MADAME
AND THE MONEY SAID MANICAMP
ALL AT ONCE ALL AT ONCE SAID THE KING PLAYFULLY SOME ONE ELSE PRESENTS HIMSELF
WAIT UPON THE LOWEST STEPS OF THE FUNERAL BASILIQUE A SUCCESSOR WHOM GOD WILL NOT SEND HIM I HOPE FOR MANY YEARS
THERE IS NOTHING COMMONPLACE ABOUT HER
MONSEIGNEUR HE ASKED WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD YOU THAT SURPRISES YOU SO MUCH THAT WHICH THROWS ME INTO DESPAIR AND WILL IN TRUTH BE A REAL CAUSE OF MOURNING FOR THE WHOLE COURT YOUR HIGHNESS IS VERY KIND FOR I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ALLUDE TO MY DEPARTURE PRECISELY GUICHE HAD OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION FROM WHERE HE WAS STANDING AND STARTED IN HIS TURN
I WILL PRETEND TO BE WRITING ARAMIS ACCORDINGLY PLACED HIMSELF AT A TABLE HIS BACK TURNED TOWARDS THE OLD ATTENDANT WHOSE EVERY GESTURE AND LOOK HE WATCHED IN A LOOKING-GLASS OPPOSITE TO HIM
DE GUICHE THE SAME REASONS FOR INDULGENCE SHE HAD HAD FOR BUCKINGHAM
IT IS SHE WHO DECLARED HER LOVE FOR THE SUN HUSH SAID THE KING
ARE THEY AFRAID TO SEE ME THAT THEY ALL TAKE WING AS SOON AS I APPEAR
NOT ONE OF THOSE YEARS WHEN YOU REIGNED QUEEN OF BEAUTY--AS YOU STILL ARE INDEED A TRUCE TO FLATTERY DUKE FOR I AM OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR MOTHER SHE EMPHASIZED THESE LATTER WORDS IN A MANNER AND WITH A GENTLENESS WHICH PENETRATED BUCKINGHAM'S HEART
BUT YOU WERE ANGRY WITH ME WERE YOU NOT I MONSEIGNEUR
THINGS WILL CHANGE THEY MUST INDEED YOU KNOW THAT WHETHER I SEE YOU OR NOT I AM THINKING OF YOU SAID MONTALAIS IN A COAXING TONE OF VOICE
A COURT IS A PLACE WHERE MEN AND WOMEN RESORT TO TALK OF MATTERS WHICH MOTHERS GUARDIANS AND ESPECIALLY CONFESSORS SEVERELY DENOUNCE OH ATHENAIS SAID LOUISE BLUSHING
WHICH MADE HIM DURING THE CEREMONY FORGET MATTERS WHICH IN HIS CHARACTER OF MOST CHRISTIAN KING AND OF THE ELDEST SON OF THE CHURCH OUGHT TO HAVE OCCUPIED HIS ATTENTION
I TAKE THE ACT TAKE IT
REPEAT
HOW SO A BREVET LIKE THIS
FORTHCOMING FOLLOWING)--CHAPTERS 209-269 OF THE THIRD BOOK OF THE D'ARTAGNAN ROMANCES
COLBERT RETURNED THE KING ASTONISHED
IF THEREFORE I DON'T PAY TO-MORROW THOSE GENTLEMEN CAN BY THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT BREAK OFF THE BARGAIN
TAKE CARE SIRE SAID HENRIETTA TO HIM IN A LOW TONE YOU DO NOT SHOW YOURSELF AS INDIFFERENT AS YOU OUGHT TO BE ALAS REPLIED THE KING IN THE SAME TONE I MUCH FEAR WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT ABOVE OUR STRENGTH TO KEEP HE THEN ADDED ALOUD YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE ACCIDENT I SUPPOSE WHAT ACCIDENT OH
AND YET I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS HOPE BECOMES LESS EVERY DAY STILL WHY SHOULD YOU NOT AGAIN BE FREE SINCE YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN SO THAT IS PRECISELY THE REASON REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WHICH PREVENTS ME FROM EXPECTING LIBERTY
THIS MORNING I FANCY I SAW THAT FACE IN EARNEST CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF M
EVEN IN DAYLIGHT ONE MAY SOMETIMES BE DECEIVED,--THERE ARE TURNINGS AND WINDINGS WITHOUT END
MANICAMP BECAUSE DE GUICHE MUST HAVE INTRUSTED HIM WITH HIS COMMISSION
IN THIS MANNER THEY REACHED THE ROYAL OAK THE VENERABLE RELIC OF A TREE WHICH IN ITS PRIME HAS LISTENED TO THE SIGHS OF HENRY II
THE COURIER FROM BLOIS WILL NOT BE HERE THESE TWO HOURS AND HE RIDES WELL I ASSURE YOU SEEING THAT I ONLY PASSED HIM ON THE THITHER SIDE OF ORLEANS MY UNCLE GASTON MURMURED LOUIS PRESSING HIS HAND TO HIS BROW AND COMPRISING IN THOSE THREE WORDS ALL THAT HIS MEMORY RECALLED OF THAT SYMBOL OF OPPOSING SENTIMENTS
IN A WORD COMTE I WISH THEM TO WAIT YET ONCE MORE SIRE COMTE YOU TOLD ME YOU CAME HERE TO REQUEST A FAVOR ASSUREDLY SIRE GRANT ME ONE THEN INSTEAD
AFTER THIS ANNE OF AUSTRIA OPENED A SMALL SPANISH LEATHER BAG CONTAINING TWO HUNDRED NUMBERS ENGRAVED UPON SMALL BALLS OF MOTHER-OF-PEARL AND PRESENTED THE OPEN SACK TO THE YOUNGEST OF HER MAIDS OF HONOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAKING ONE OF THE BALLS OUT OF IT
THAT GAYETY OF MANNER WHICH EVERY ONE HAD REMARKED IN HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL AND WHICH THEY HAD BEEN DELIGHTED TO PERCEIVE HAD NOT PERHAPS BEEN UNDERSTOOD IN ITS TRUE SENSE
THE SHEET OF WATER ILLUMINATED BY THE LIGHTS WHICH WERE REFLECTED IN IT
YOU CAN GET SETS OF FALSE JEWELS MADE FOR ME SIMILAR TO THE REAL
HAVING EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS OF AMUSEMENT THE ROUTE OFFERED THEY ARRIVED AS WE HAVE SAID AT CALAIS TOWARDS THE END OF THE SIXTH DAY
THE GREATER NUMBER OF THESE HOWEVER OBSERVING THAT THE KING FEARLESSLY ENTERED THE WOOD WITH LA VALLIERE FOLLOWED HIS MAJESTY
FOR SHAME M
D'ARTAGNAN SALUTED MOST COURTEOUSLY THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE EXPLANATION
MADAME HAD SIGHED VERY NOISELESSLY BUT WITH AN ACCOMPANIMENT VERY FAR MORE DANGEROUS FOR THE KING'S REPOSE
THE THREE MUSKETEERS
I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU HOWEVER THAT THE INQUIRY WILL BE USELESS
HOW WAS IT THAT MALICORNE HAD MET MANICAMP
BESIDES IN THE PRESENT CASE AFTER MONSIEUR HAD LEFT AND AFTER THE COURTEOUS AND AFFECTIONATE RECOGNITION OF THE YOUNG QUEEN AND OF THE QUEEN-MOTHER AND THE CARELESS AND INDIFFERENT NOTICE OF MADAME WHICH ALL THE COURTIERS HAD REMARKED
THE TIDE YOU PERCEIVE IS RISING
LE COMTE DE GUICHE ONE OF THE BEST FURNISHED PURSES OF THE PERIOD
BUT MADAME WAS NOT ADMITTED TO MONSIEUR'S APARTMENTS AND SHE WAS INFORMED THAT MONSIEUR WAS ASLEEP
IT IS YOUR OPINION I ASK AT LEAST INFORM ME OF THE SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION DE WARDES ASSERTS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF TITLES IS ABUSED
NO NO I AM NOT JEALOUS OF THE HUSBAND
YOUR MAJESTY MUST ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOU ARE AS WELL INFORMED OF THINGS OUT OF DOORS AS THINGS WITHIN
SIMILAR SEVERITY FROM ANY OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ONCE RESISTED BY HIM
YOU PERCEIVE SAID ATHOS TO D'ARTAGNAN THAT RAOUL CANNOT SOONER OR LATER AVOID A DUEL WITH DE WARDES FOR DE WARDES IS AS BRAVE AS HE IS VICIOUS AND WICKED I KNOW SUCH FELLOWS WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
UNDER A PRETEXT THAT WAS LITTLE REMARKED M
IN MY MIND I DO SO I TELL YOU--_ANIMO MAITRE GRISART VIRIBUS IMPOSSIBILE AND HE AGAIN FELL BACK ON THE ARMCHAIR IN AN ALMOST SENSELESS STATE
WHAT GOOD DO YOU SEE IN MY TROUBLING MYSELF ABOUT HER THIS.--THE KING IT IS SAID HAS TAKEN A FANCY TO HER
IT WOULD NOT BECOME ME TO REFER TO SO PALTRY A SERVICE IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A MAN AS M
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S SILENCE AS IF THE MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS OF NIGHT WERE HUSHED TO LISTEN AT THE SAME TIME AS MADAME TO THE YOUTHFUL PASSIONATE DISCLOSURES OF DE GUICHE
WELL SAID MADAME DE BELLIERE WHO HAD A VAGUE HOPE THAT MARGUERITE WOULD CEASE TO OVERWHELM A VANQUISHED ENEMY WHY DO YOU NOT GO AND SEE M
IF HE IS NOT AWARE OF IT WE SHALL SEE WHAT HE WILL DO IF HE SHOULD KNOW IT AS IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES SO THAT WHILST HE ENTERS BY ONE WE CAN LEAVE BY THE OTHER IS IT FAR ASKED ARAMIS FOR THE RAIN IS BEGINNING TO PENETRATE WE ARE THERE NOW SAID FOUQUET AS HE PUSHED ASIDE A FEW BRANCHES AND AN EXCAVATION IN THE SOLID ROCK COULD BE OBSERVED HITHERTO CONCEALED BY HEATHS IVY AND A THICK COVERT OF SMALL SHRUBS
THE FACT REMAINS DID OR DID NOT THE KING OVERHEAR OH YES MADAME HE CERTAINLY DID SAID ATHENAIS IN DESPAIR
LET IT BE NO AND I OPEN THIS DOOR AND SHE POINTED TO THE DOOR WHICH LED INTO THE STREETS AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN
GREAT HEAVENS EXCLAIMED RAOUL FIXING HIS BEWILDERED GAZE UPON THE ENTRANCE DOORWAY
ANSWER ME SAID THE SICK MAN DISPLAYING WITH A DIGNIFIED GESTURE A GOLDEN RING THE STONE OF WHICH HAD UNTIL THAT MOMENT BEEN TURNED INSIDE AND WHICH BORE ENGRAVED THEREON THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS
I HAVE PAID EVERY YEAR TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS TO THESE TWO GENTLEMEN
THE KING HARDLY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER DEPARTURE NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRETENDED SYMPTOMS OF INDISPOSITION BY WHICH IT WAS ACCOMPANIED
CONCLUSION OF THE STORY OF A NAIAD AND OF A DRYAD
I RATHER FANCY I AM INVITING MYSELF YOUR MAJESTY OVERWHELMS ME WITH HONOR AND DELIGHT EXCLAIMED FOUQUET BUT I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO REPEAT WHAT M
TEN MINUTES HENCE IT WILL HAVE SOAKED THE SANDS WHERE WE ARE NOW WALKING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP OUR FOOTING I AWAIT YOUR ORDERS MY LORD BUT BUT YOU MEAN WE ARE STILL UPON SOIL WHICH IS PART OF THE KING'S TERRITORY EXACTLY WELL DO YOU SEE YONDER A KIND OF LITTLE ISLAND SURROUNDED BY A CIRCLE OF WATER
YOU ARE WET ALREADY AND PERHAPS COLD TOO NO SIRE AND YET YOU TREMBLE I AM AFRAID SIRE THAT MY ABSENCE MAY BE MISINTERPRETED
THEY DISTINCTLY SAW THE LEAVES MOVE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT STIRRED THEM
AND I MUST LEARN WHAT THAT OBJECT IS WHICH SHE HAS IN VIEW AND WHO IT IS THAT PROTECTS HER AND FOLLOWING MALICORNE'S MANEUVER HE MADE HIS WAY TOWARD THE GROUP OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR
BUT FROM FIFTEEN FRANCS I SINK AT ONCE TO TEN FRANCS
AND AS A MAN OF HONOR IS INCAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING BUT WHAT HE KNOWS TO BE TRUE OR OF SPEAKING OTHERWISE THAN WHAT HE THINKS I WILL SAY NO MORE BUT CONFESS MYSELF DEFEATED AND LEAVE YOU IN POSSESSION OF THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHEREUPON RAOUL WHO NOW SEEMED ONLY TO CARE TO BE LEFT QUIET THREW HIMSELF UPON A COUCH WHILST THE COUNT SUMMONED HIS SERVANTS TO AID HIM IN DRESSING
PARTICULARLY IF YOU TAKE THE POTION I WILL SEND YOU PRESENTLY AND THAT WILL GIVE ME TWO HOURS OF LIFE TWO HOURS I WOULD TAKE IT WERE IT POISON FOR THOSE TWO HOURS ARE NECESSARY NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR THE GLORY OF THE ORDER WHAT A LOSS WHAT A CATASTROPHE FOR US ALL MURMURED THE PHYSICIAN
DURING THE THREE DAYS I SPENT AT SAINT-MANDE I CONFESS I HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM COMPLETELY I DO NOT FORGET HIM HOWEVER RETURNED ARAMIS
BETWEEN OURSELVES SHE SAID I THINK THAT MADAME AND THE KING HAVE COME TO A SECRET UNDERSTANDING ABOUT IT AH SAID MALICORNE
RAOUL UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS AUDIENCE WAS AT AN END
AND NOW THE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO GOOD-BYE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GOOD-BYE OF COURSE YOU CAN NOW RETURN TO YOUR INN TO MY INN YES
DE BRAGELONNE WHO CARRIES A SWORD BY HIS SIDE DOES NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF INSULTED AT ALL EVENTS YOU INSULT SOMEONE YES I INSULTED M
DE SAINT-AIGNAN I BELIEVE SO SAID THE LATTER QUITE OUT OF COUNTENANCE
THEREFORE HAVING POSITIVELY DENIED ITS RECEIPT SHE WAS UNABLE EITHER TO RETURN OR BURN IT OH OH SAID ARAMIS WITH UNEASINESS WHAT IS THIS YOU TELL ME I SAY THAT SHE SWORE MOST POSITIVELY SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY LETTER THAT IS TOO MUCH
PUT IT TO THE TWO GENTLEMEN IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:--"HAVE YOU ANY MONEY SIRE REPLIED SAINT-AIGNAN WE HAVE ARRANGED EVERYTHING WITH M
WHEN ONE HAS TO COMPLAIN OF ANYTHING IT IS GENERALLY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE CAUSE OF IT
BUT THAT YOU SHOULD SANCTION IT BY YOUR INDULGENCE IS WHAT I WILL NOT ALLOW BUT IN TRUTH SAID MONTALAIS REBELLING AGAIN I DO NOT KNOW UNDER WHAT PRETENSE YOU TREAT ME THUS
AND THE ADMIRAL WHO HEARD IT GIVEN IMMEDIATELY CALLED OUT LAUNCH THE SHIP'S GIG HIS DIRECTIONS WERE EXECUTED WITH THAT CELERITY WHICH DISTINGUISHES EVERY MANEUVER ON BOARD A MAN-OF-WAR
WE WILL ENDEAVOR TO OBEY YOU MADEMOISELLE AND YOU WILL HAVE HER NAMED WE WILL TRY NO EVASIVE ANSWERS LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE SHALL BE MAID OF HONOR TO MADAME HENRIETTA WITHIN A WEEK HOW YOU TALK WITHIN A WEEK OR ELSE WELL
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT A BROTHER AND SISTER CANNOT CONVERSE TOGETHER OR TAKE PLEASURE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO REMARKS AND SUSPICIONS
THEN BOWING HE LEFT THE ROOM TO SEEK ARAMIS WHO WAS WAITING FOR HIM IN HIS OWN APARTMENT AND LEAVING LA VALLIERE TO ASK HERSELF WHETHER THE SUPERINTENDENT HAD NOT LOST HIS SENSES
DE MONTESPAN OH
I WILL GUARANTEE THAT HE DOES YOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY KIND SAID FOUQUET
WELL THE SCENT IS LOST AND UNLESS SOME EXTRAORDINARY CHANCE AND THUS SAYING AS IF TO APPEAL TO HIS GOOD STAR THE CHEVALIER GREATLY OUT OF TEMPER APPROACHED THE WINDOW WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON A SOMEWHAT SOLITARY PART OF THE GARDEN
THE EFFECT OF THE VOICE WAS SUCH AS ALMOST TO OVERPOWER ARAMIS AND NOTWITHSTANDING HIS CONTROL OVER HIMSELF HE ADVANCED A FEW STEPS TOWARDS HIM WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN AND HIS LIPS TREMBLING
DE GUICHE INDEMNIFIED THE PRINCESS BY A LOOK OF PASSIONATE DEVOTION AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT MADAME AS SHE RAISED HER EYES RETURNED IT TO HIM WITH INTEREST
BUT THOSE WHO ARE ILL DISPOSED TOWARDS ME DO YOU WISH TO HEAR THE NAME I HAVE BEEN WAITING THIS HALF HOUR FOR IT WELL THEN YOU SHALL HEAR IT
IN MANY HOUSES THE PRESENCE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANT OF FORTUNE
BUT ANNOUNCE TO-DAY THAT IT IS YOUR WISH TO LEAVE MY WISH MURMURED THE YOUNG DUKE
THE YOUNG QUEEN LOOKED FIRST AT LA VALLIERE AND THEN AT MADAME AND BEGAN TO LAUGH
SO LONG AS MADAME REMAINED ON ENGLISH TERRITORY I HELD MY PEACE
WHEN THEY HAD ARRIVED AT THE GROVE OF TREES THE FOREMOST OF THE TWO HALTED SOMEWHAT OUT OF BREATH AND CAUTIOUSLY RAISING HER HOOD SAID ARE WE STILL FAR FROM THE TREE YES MADAME MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PACES
YOU WILL FIND ME AT MY APARTMENTS UNTIL TO-MORROW
SAINT-AIGNAN DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO TURN
AND IN THE WHOLE OF THIS AFFAIR I SEE NONE
AND HER EYES SO TIMOROUS IN THEIR EXPRESSION AND SO MODESTLY FUGITIVE IN THEIR GLANCE FOR A MOMENT VENTURED TO LOOK INQUIRINGLY INTO THE KING'S
YOUR GRACE WILL ADMIT THAT THIS IS HARDLY FRIENDLY CONDUCT IN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A FRIENDLY NATION THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION BELONGS TO HIM WHO IS FIRST ON THE GROUND NOT IN FRANCE MONSIEUR WHY NOT IN FRANCE BECAUSE FRANCE IS A COUNTRY WHERE POLITENESS IS OBSERVED WHICH MEANS EXCLAIMED BUCKINGHAM IN SO VIOLENT A MANNER THAT THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT DREW BACK EXPECTING AN IMMEDIATE COLLISION
DE GUICHE AT THAT MOMENT REIGNED WITHOUT A RIVAL
I DEFY YOU THEREFORE IF I WERE MINISTER TO CONTINUE TO BESTOW THAT TITLE UPON ME
ANNE OF AUSTRIA WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN REJOICED TO HAVE HAD A DAUGHTER ALMOST FOUND IN THIS HER FAVORITE SON THE ATTENTIONS SOLICITUDE AND PLAYFUL MANNERS OF A CHILD OF TWELVE YEARS OF AGE
THE SERVICES RENDERED WERE HUMBLE AND PROPERLY SPEAKING OUR SERVICES HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY RECOGNIZED
I AM ON THORNS SEE OUR DELIVERER APPROACHES SAID RAOUL PERCEIVING D'ARTAGNAN WHO MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED IN HIS NEW UNIFORM OF CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HAD JUST MADE HIS ENTRY IN THE GALLERY
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORGET SUCH BEAUTIFUL EYES AS MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE HAS YET THE OTHER ONE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE WHICH ONE THE LADY WHO HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE SUN M
THE FISHERMEN OBSERVING A GROUP OF MEN APPROACHING CARRYING A WOUNDED MAN ENTERED THE SEA UNTIL THE WATER WAS UP TO THEIR WAISTS
BUT I REPEAT IT IS TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT I GIVE THESE LITTLE SURPRISES ARAMIS MECHANICALLY TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THE REGISTER CONTINUING TO READ THE NAMES BUT WITHOUT APPEARING TO TAKE ANY INTEREST IN THE NAMES HE READ
MONSIEUR ARRIVED HOLDING IN HIS HAND A DRAWING REPRESENTING HIS CHARACTER
ARAMIS WHOSE REAL NAME IS D'HERBLAY HAS FOLLOWED HIS INTENTION OF SHEDDING THE MUSKETEER'S CASSOCK FOR THE PRIEST'S ROBES AND PORTHOS HAS MARRIED A WEALTHY WOMAN WHO LEFT HIM HER FORTUNE UPON HER DEATH
YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE WORD LA VALLIERE A GRAND DISCOVERY INDEED MONTALAIS AND LA VALLIERE THESE THEN ARE THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS IN WHOM YOU INTEREST YOURSELF SAID SAINT-AIGNAN LAUGHING
HIS ATTENTION HOWEVER WAS NOW ELSEWHERE FOR IT WANDERED AS HIS EYES DID
THAT I SHOULD LOSE MY SOUL FROM ANGER MALICORNE WAS ROLLING HIS HAT RESPECTFULLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS
DE GUICHE GOING OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
YES MONTALAIS FIRST YOU I OR DE GUICHE,--WHOEVER LIKES IN FACT AND THE OTHER MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE YES TAKE CARE GENTLEMEN EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE ANXIOUS TO PUT A STOP TO THE CHEVALIER'S REPLY
AROUND WHOM THE BUTTERFLIES OF THE COURT WERE FLUTTERING
I FORM RESOLUTIONS BESIDE WHICH THE LAWS OF THE STADTHOLDER AND OF THE KING OF SPAIN ARE CHILD'S PLAY
EITHER MADAME HAD BEEN THE INSTIGATOR OF THE AFFAIR OR THE AFFAIR ITSELF HAD FOUND HER PASSIVE
DE MALICORNE THIS HORSE MONSIEUR LE COMTE IS OF THE MECKLENBURG BREED
WAS NOW RETURNING TO FRANCE
DE GUICHE IS LODGING OF COURSE AND I KNOW THAT AS WELL
I FATTEN A GOOD DEAL OF POULTRY BUT I HAVE TO BUY GRAIN AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE ARMY OF RATS THAT INFEST THIS PLACE WHY NOT GET HALF A DOZEN CATS TO DEAL WITH THEM CATS INDEED
GUICHE IS THE FURNISHER OF THE MAIDS OF HONOR AND HE HAS STOCKED THE BIRDCAGE
THE SENTINEL AT THE OUTER GUARDHOUSE STOPPED ARAMIS'S FURTHER PROGRESS ASKING HIM IN A ROUGH TONE OF VOICE WHAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE
THIS SECOND ALTERNATIVE SEEMS TO ME THE LEAST DISAGREEABLE AND I THINK I SHALL HOLD TO IT BUCKINGHAM HAD BECOME PALER THAN THE LACE COLLAR AROUND HIS NECK
THE VESSEL BELONGS TO THE ORDER
YOU WILL CONSIDER REPEATED COLBERT
I BEG YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT MOST DISTINCTLY BUT EXCLAIMED DE GUICHE LOOK DE WARDES--LOOK MANICAMP--LOOK YONDER THE PRINCESSES ARE LOOKING AT US FROM THE POOP OF THE ADMIRAL'S VESSEL AN ADDITIONAL REASON MY DEAR FELLOW WHY WE SHOULD NOT MAKE OURSELVES RIDICULOUS BY BEING DROWNED WHILE THEY ARE LOOKING ON IS THAT YOUR LAST WORD MANICAMP YES AND THEN YOURS DE WARDES YES THEN I GO ALONE NOT SO SAID RAOUL FOR I SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU
THAT WOMAN WHO CAME FROM ENGLAND RETURNED TO ENGLAND AFTER HAVING THRICE ATTEMPTED M
IT WAS DE GUICHE AND DE BRAGELONNE THE SIGHT OF WHOM AS IT ALWAYS DID PRODUCED UPON THE CHEVALIER INSTINCTIVELY A FEELING OF REPUGNANCE
MONTALAIS STOOD BY ADMIRINGLY
I HAVE AN INDISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF MONSIEUR BAISEMEAUX SAID ATHOS
ADIEU YOU WILL NOT BE PRESENT THEN AT THE BALLET VICOMTE NO
TWO SENTINELS WERE ON DUTY AT THE GATE
I DO NOT KNOW OF EITHER OBLIGATION OR INJURY RECEIVED AT HIS HANDS BUT YOU HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM
JUSTLY THAT EVENING STYLED THE KING OF ALL THE LOVES THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
SAINT-AIGNAN WIPED HIS FOREHEAD NOW DEWED WITH PERSPIRATION
YES I UNDERSTAND
FOR THAT FUTURE WITH THE REIGN OF THE NEW KING IS OPENING RADIANT AND FULL OF SPLENDOR THESE WORDS WHICH HAD BEEN HALF-REFLECTED HALF-PRONOUNCED ALOUD WERE LISTENED TO BY THE JESUIT CONFESSOR WITH A TERROR SIMILAR TO THAT WITH WHICH ONE LISTENS TO THE WANDERINGS OF A PERSON ATTACKED BY FEVER WHILST GRISART WITH A MIND OF HIGHER ORDER DEVOURED THEM AS THE REVELATIONS OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN WHICH HIS LOOKS WERE PLUNGED WITHOUT ABILITY TO COMPREHEND
I HAVE RETIRED TO MY OWN ROOM OVERCOME WITH GRIEF AND FATIGUE SIRE
FOR INSTANCE WHENEVER A HUSBAND REMARKS THAT HIS WIFE SUMMONS SUCH AND SUCH A MAN NEAR HER
IN THIS WAY MONSIEUR MANICAMP WITH A THOUGHTLESS AND ABSENT AIR--FOR M
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT I SHALL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY WHEREVER I MAY HAVE THE HONOR OF CROSSING MY SWORD WITH YOUR LORDSHIP'S VERY WELL THEN I AM DISTRESSED TO BE THE CAUSE OF YOUR WETTING YOUR FEET M
IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE WHAT THE DEUCE WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IN MY PLACE ONE COULD NOT FORCE HER CERTAINLY BUT IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING
YES COMTE CONTINUED GUICHE
BUT LISTEN
AT ANY HOUR CHEVALIER
OR IF HE BE NOT HE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PLEASE EXCUSE ME BUT WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT MY FRIEND OF COURSE FOR YOU HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO SO HE INTENDED TO COME AS YOU KNOW AND HE DOES SO STILL HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE CHANGED HIS OPINION NO YOU ARE QUITE SURE THEN QUITE SURE BUT IN CASE YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME DOUBT WELL I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I DO NOT POSITIVELY ASSURE YOU THAT HE WILL COME YET HE TOLD YOU HE CERTAINLY DID TELL ME
IS MY CONDUCT THAT OF A SINCERE FRIEND
ONE OF THEM UNHAPPILY NOW BELONGS TO FRANCE AND YOU PERCEIVE THAT FRANCE CLAIMS THEM BY THE VOICE OF HER AMBASSADORS AND AT THE SAME MOMENT HE INDICATED RAOUL AND GUICHE WHOM HE SALUTED
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE PORTRAIT
THE NEXT TEXT IN THE SERIES IS LOUISE DE LA VALLIERE
THEN WHEN ONCE AN INCUMBENT OF THIS POST HE WOULD MARRY MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS
HE THEN ASSISTED LOUIS TO SEAT THE YOUNG GIRL UPON A COUCH SLAPPED HER HANDS SPRINKLED SOME HUNGARY WATER OVER HER FACE CALLING OUT ALL THE WHILE COME COME IT IS ALL OVER
BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN YOU HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN YOUR INFORMATION FROM ONE DRYAD ONLY I BELIEVE YES MADAME ONLY FROM ONE I CONFESS THE FACT WAS THAT YOU PASSED BY A LITTLE NAIAD WHO PRETENDED TO KNOW NOTHING AT ALL AND YET KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOUR DRYAD MY DEAR COMTE A NAIAD REPEATED SEVERAL VOICES WHO BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT THE STORY HAD A CONTINUATION
BESIDES I HAVE THE HONOR TO MENTION TO YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE SIX LEAGUES OF SEA FROM THE RIVER TO BELLE-ISLE IT IS SAID THAT M
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENTS THE SOLDIERS BARRED HIS PASSAGE AND HIS FURTHER PROGRESS WAS ARRESTED
IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE IS SO GOOD SO GENTLE AND PURE THAT YOUR MIND SO PERFECT IN ITS PENETRATION OUGHT TO APPRECIATE HER ACCORDINGLY
A ROOM SIMPLY OR LODGINGS ANYTHING YOU PLEASE BY LETTER INQUIRED THE LANDLORD
TO INFORM HIM OF IT BY BEING THE FIRST TO SPEAK IS TO DENOUNCE YOURSELF OH MADAME MADAME
DE GUICHE HAS NOT BETRAYED HIMSELF MY DEAR SISTER YOU ARE DEFENDING M
IF I REQUIRE HIM I WILL CALL
BUT A DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL BE ENLIGHTENED OH SAID FOUQUET HOW WILLINGLY WOULD I BELIEVE YOU WITHOUT BELIEF
FOR I MUST THANK YOU AT LEAST AND FOR WHAT FOR THE COMMISSION
MADAME WAS NEITHER A PROPHETESS NOR A SIBYL
WHEN KINGS HAVE TASTED MONEY THEY ARE LIKE TIGERS WHO HAVE TASTED FLESH THEY DEVOUR EVERYTHING
YES WELL MY CHOICE IS MADE
AND THEN AS IF HE WERE ENGAGED WITH MADAME IN A DISSERTATION UPON THE BUTTERFLY WHICH HE HAD THRUST THROUGH WITH A GOLD PIN AND FASTENED ON HIS HAT SAID TO HER HOW ADMIRABLY WE ARE PLACED HERE FOR CONVERSATIONS YES SIRE FOR I WISHED TO BE HEARD BY YOU ALONE AND YET TO BE SEEN BY EVERY ONE AND I ALSO SAID LOUIS
MANICAMP I CANNOT INTRODUCE A MAN OVER THE WALL IN THAT MANNER TWO IF YOU PLEASE SAID A SECOND VOICE BUT IN SO TIMID A TONE THAT IT SEEMED AS IF ITS OWNER FELT THE UTTER IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A REQUEST
THE THEATER REPRESENTED A GROVE OF TREES
I AM JEALOUS OF THE LOVER OF THE LOVER SAID RAOUL
THEY HAVE A PERFECT RAGE FOR MONOPOLIZING EVERYTHING THAT MAY BE
BUT MONTALAIS ON THIS OCCASION WAS HELD IN CHECK BY MALICORNE WHO HAD SECURELY FASTENED ON HER PRETTY LIPS THE GOLDEN PADLOCK OF MUTUAL INTEREST
IT IS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH TO HAVE TO SUPPORT MADAME'S INDIFFERENCE
AND THAT IS MY REASON FOR SAYING THAT THE RUIN OF POOR M
THERE NOW YOUR MYTHOLOGICAL NAME IS FOUND AT LAST PERFECTLY TRUE COMTE AND TAKE M
THE SIGHT OF THE FIVE THOUSAND PISTOLES WHICH HE GLANCED AT FROM TIME TO TIME SEEMED TO OPEN HIS HEART
THERE HE IS BEWILDERED IN HIS PHRASES WHO I YES YOU
DE SAINT-REMY MY STEP-FATHER
AMBITIOUS A FOOL AND STRAITENED IN MEANS HE FOLDED UP THE PAPERS WHICH HE THRUST UNDER HIS PILLOW
CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT A PRINCE OF THE BLOOD THE BROTHER OF THE KING OF FRANCE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HIDE AN INJURY EVEN DID IT EXIST IN REALITY WHERE POLITICAL NECESSITY REQUIRES IT PHILIP MADE A MOVEMENT
TO-MORROW WILL DO THERE ARE SOME URGENT LETTERS WHICH YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE PERHAPS WHERE FROM INQUIRED THE CHEVALIER
TRUE IT IS THAT SAINT-AIGNAN HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
AMYNTAS HE SAID IS SOMEWHAT OLDER THAN TYRCIS
SWORD-THRUSTS IN THE WATER
A MAN IN YOUR POSITION MY LORD IS ONLY LOST WHEN HE WISHES TO BE SO A MAN WHATEVER HIS POSITION MAY BE CANNOT HOPE TO STRUGGLE AGAINST A KING NONSENSE
DE MANICAMP
WHY INQUIRED RAOUL
LOVE HER PORTRAIT A MEMENTO RAOUL LOVE IS A SHADOW AN ILLUSION A CHIMERA
HERE IS A LIST OF THE OTHER DUMAS ETEXTS WE HAVE PUBLISHED SO FAR
FOR TWO MEN TWO HOUSES OR FOUR OR SIX OR TEN IF YOU LIKE
NO THE MAN IS NOT YET FOUND AND TO COMPLETE THE MISFORTUNE HEAVEN STRIKES ME DOWN AND I AM DYING
DE WARDES TO ASSIST YOU IN YOUR DESIGNS FOR I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT AFFORD YOU THAT PLEASURE SENSIBLY OBSERVED SAID BUCKINGHAM PUTTING UP HIS SWORD AND I ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS M
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
BUCKINGHAM HEARD THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN WITH SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF DELIGHT THAT A STRANGER WOULD REALLY IMAGINE THE YOUNG MAN'S REASON WAS AFFECTED
CHAPTER XLII
IN WHICH HOWEVER AT THE FIRST GLANCE NO SINGLE FACE COULD BE DISTINGUISHED
CERTES THIS PLAN PRESENTED ITSELF BRISTLING WITH DIFFICULTIES
SIRE REPLIED FOUQUET I HAVE NOT EVEN THOUGHT OF THE FETE YOU SPEAK OF AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY EVENING THAT ONE OF MY FRIENDS FOUQUET LAID A STRESS UPON THE WORD WAS KIND ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK OF IT YET I SAW YOU YESTERDAY EVENING MONSIEUR FOUQUET AND YOU SAID NOTHING TO ME ABOUT IT HOW DARED I HOPE THAT YOUR MAJESTY WOULD SO GREATLY DESCEND FROM YOUR OWN EXALTED STATION AS TO HONOR MY DWELLING WITH YOUR ROYAL PRESENCE EXCUSE ME MONSIEUR FOUQUET YOU DID NOT SPEAK TO ME ABOUT YOUR FETE I DID NOT ALLUDE TO THE FETE TO YOUR MAJESTY I REPEAT IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE NOTHING HAD BEEN DECIDED WITH REGARD TO IT AND SECONDLY BECAUSE I FEARED A REFUSAL AND SOMETHING MADE YOU FEAR A REFUSAL MONSIEUR FOUQUET
BUT IT IS A REASON WHY I SHOULD MAKE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WITHOUT ANY DELAY WHAT IS IT THAT I WAS NOT BORN A GENTLEMAN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER MALICORNE AND MANICAMP HAD BEEN TURNED OUT ARAMIS APPROACHED THE FRANCISCAN AND ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WOULD PREFER THE APARTMENT OR THE ROOM
I AM PUTTING YOU TO INCONVENIENCE HE CONTINUED FIXING A KEEN GLACE UPON THE POOR GOVERNOR
AND SO IT IS CLEAR YOU DO NOT LOVE POOR M
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT AND DE GUICHE AFRAID THAT SAINT-AIGNAN MIGHT PERHAPS PRESENTLY OBSERVE THE WINDOW WHERE THE LIGHT WAS STILL BURNING TOOK THE COMTE'S ARM AND ENDEAVORED TO LEAD HIM AWAY
THE PRINCESS TOOK HIS HAND IN HERS
D'ARTAGNAN'S FRIENDS TO DEFEND HIM I AM ENTIRELY OF YOUR OPINION REPLIED THE DUKE WHO HAD REGAINED ALL HIS INDIFFERENCE OF MANNER
AND I KNOW FROM VERY GOOD AUTHORITY THAT MADAME THOUGHT HIM INSUPPORTABLE M
THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE WERE PUSHED ASIDE AND A WOMAN PALE AND MUCH AGITATED APPEARED BEFORE THE TWO YOUNG MEN
AT THE SOUND OF THE KING'S FOOTSTEPS WHICH COULD BE HEARD UPON THE CARPET THE DUKE HURRIEDLY MADE HIS ESCAPE
AH SAID THE CHEVALIER LAUGHING THIS IS INDEED A CIRCUMSTANCE I WAS NOT ACQUAINTED WITH
ON THE SECOND DAY HOWEVER MONSIEUR FINDING NO ONE NEAR HIM INQUIRED WHERE THE CHEVALIER WAS
DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE REMARKED AND IT DOES ME INFINITE HONOR THAT CERTAIN PRISONERS WHO HAVE BEEN SET AT LIBERTY HAVE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS GOT IMPRISONED AGAIN
THE DITCHES WERE BORDERED BY HIGH HEDGES FULL OF FLOWERS WHICH ON THAT SIDE PROTECTED THE FOOT-PASSENGERS FROM BEING INTRUDED UPON BY THE HORSES AND CARRIAGES
EVEN THAT IS AN IMMENSE AND PRECIOUS BOON I KNOW
BUT LET US SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NOT WHAT WOULD YOUR OPINION BE MY LORD THAT YOUR HIGHNESS IS EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY TO HAVE SO CHARMING A BRIDE THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE BURST OUT LAUGHING
ONE CAKE IS VERY LITTLE FOR THREE MOUTHS
WOULD HE ALLOW HIMSELF TO ACCEPT FROM ANY WOMAN THAT OF WHICH SHE HAD STRIPPED HERSELF
MY FRIENDS SAID HE HERE IS SOMETHING TO REPAY YOU FOR THE CARE YOU HAVE TAKEN OF ME
I DESIRE AS YOU KNOW THAT NO PROMISE SHOULD EVER BE MADE IN MY NAME WITHOUT BEING KEPT WITHOUT A MOMENT'S LOSS OF TIME OUR TWO PRIVATEERS AND YOUR OWN HORSES WERE PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE OFFICERS
COMMAND ME AT ANY TIME THAT MAY SUIT YOU MY LORD RESUMED THE QUEEN
WELL THEN IF IT BE NOT MADEMOISELLE AURE DE MONTALAIS IT IS THAT PRETTY BLONDE WHO FOLLOWS HER
A LOVING HEART IS STRONGER THAN ALL YOUR COQUETRY MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL YOUR PRIDE
COLBERT WHO HAS SO WELL INFORMED YOU HAS HE NOT FORGOTTEN TO TELL YOU THAT THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE SON OF MY MOST INTIMATE FRIEND THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE CERTAINLY SIRE
NOW DON'T GET SULKY DE GUICHE FOR IT DOES YOU NO GOOD BUT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A TAME BEAR
I HAD ALREADY ONCE BEFORE BROACHED THIS QUESTION WHICH IS SO DIFFICULT FOR A YOUNG GIRL OF MY AGE TO DISCUSS BUT YOUR MAJESTY IMPOSED SILENCE ON ME
THE KING AND MADAME HOWEVER KEPT THEIR HORSES IN HAND AT A FOOT-PACE
INSTEAD THEREFORE OF KNITTING HIS BROWS INTO A FROWN WHEN HE PERCEIVED HIS SISTER-IN-LAW LOUIS RESOLVED TO RECEIVE HER IN A MORE FRIENDLY AND GRACIOUS MANNER THAN USUAL
I SHOULD MAKE A GOOD TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS AN AGREEABLE SUM VERY MUCH SO MADAME WILL YOU THEN ACCEPT THAT PROFIT THEN ON CONDITION OF CONVERTING THE JEWELS INTO MONEY BUT YOU DO NOT INTEND TO SELL YOU DIAMONDS I SUPPOSE MADAME EXCLAIMED THE BEWILDERED JEWELER
THE KING COLORED
CALL THE BREMEN MERCHANT
GIVE YOUR SHEPHERDESSES NAMES IN A SIMILAR MANNER OH
I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU YOUR FACE IN A GLASS AND YOU WOULD SEE HOW PLUMP AND FLORID-LOOKING YOU ARE AS FAT AND ROUND AS A CHEESE WITH EYES LIKE LIGHTED COALS
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS WILL STEP DOWN TO TALK WITH YOU WHILE WE GO UP-STAIRS TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE FOR IN FACT IT IS SHE ONLY WHOM WE DESIRE TO SEE THE KING EXCLAIMED MALICORNE BOWING TO THE VERY GROUND
BESIDES THERE ARE CERTAIN TERRESTRIAL SOVEREIGNS WHO SEEM TO HAVE ACCORDED THEM PRIVILEGED EXISTENCES AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES WHEN IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SUPPOSED THAT THE EXPRESSED WISH OF AN EARTHLY MONARCH HAS ITS INFLUENCE OVER THE DIVINE WILL
TO BE BOARDED AT FIFTEEN FRANCS
IS IT NOT INCREDIBLE LOUISE BUT LOUISE DID NOT REPLY
UPON THE EVENT OF HIS DEATH IT WILL BE CONFERRED UPON THE KING'S BROTHER PHILIP WHO IS CURRENTLY THE DUC D'ANJOU
BUT THERE REMAINS FOR US THANK GOD
HE SCENTS MISCHIEF EVERYWHERE AND SOONER THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND TAKING LEAVE OF THE PRINCE HE QUITTED THE APARTMENT
DE GUICHE IS NOT IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS I SUPPOSE NO INDEED WELL THEN THE PATH WHICH LEADS TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS IS OF NO USE TO ME AND I WOULD WILLINGLY EXCHANGE IT FOR THE ONE THAT LEADS TO WHERE M
I LAY SAID MALICORNE CURIOUS ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW THIS SELLER OF CLOTHES WOULD GET THROUGH
SHE THEN RESUMED
THE INTREPID PROTECTOR OF EVERY BEAUTIFUL AND CLEVER WOMAN IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS WHAT STORY HAVE YOU GOT HOLD OF NOW ACKNOWLEDGED TRUTHS I AM WELL AWARE
AT THAT MOMENT M
BUT I WILL LOOK UPON HIM EVEN WERE I TO BE BLINDED IN DOING SO AT THIS MOMENT AND AS THOUGH CAUSED BY THE WORDS WHICH HAD JUST ESCAPED LA VALLIERE'S LIPS A RUSTLING OF LEAVES AND OF WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOME SILKEN MATERIAL WAS HEARD BEHIND THE ADJOINING BUSHES
COUNT EXCLAIMED THE CHEVALIER YOU WHO WENT INTO SUCH ECSTASIES AND UTTERED SO MANY EXCLAMATIONS AT THE SIGHT OF HER PORTRAIT DE GUICHE COLORED VIOLENTLY
FOR THE QUEEN WILL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT VERY SOON THIS LATTER CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION HAD AN IMMEDIATE RESULT
MY CARRIAGES HAVE BEEN READY FOR THREE DAYS THE DUC D'ORLEANS MADE A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD WHICH SEEMED TO SIGNIFY SINCE YOU ARE DETERMINED DUKE THERE IS NOTHING TO BE SAID BUCKINGHAM RETURNED THE GESTURE CONCEALING UNDER A SMILE A CONTRACTION OF HIS HEART
WHILST MADAME THE DOWAGER NO LONGER REMEMBERING THAT IN HER YOUNG DAYS SHE HAD LOVED THAT SENSELESS CORPSE TO SUCH A DEGREE AS TO FLY THE PATERNAL PALACE FOR HIS SAKE WAS MAKING WITHIN TWENTY PACES OF THE FUNERAL APARTMENT HER LITTLE CALCULATIONS OF INTEREST AND HER LITTLE SACRIFICES OF PRIDE
YES I BELIEVE SO
INDEED MARQUISE YOU WILL ALMOST MAKE ME BELIEVE I AM SO JUDGING FROM YOUR OWN SADNESS
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT OR WHOM I FOUND THERE
WAS THAT WHAT YOU SAID NOTHING ELSE VERY GOOD
AND YET I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE TOWARDS YOU THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN SO BADLY INFORMED AS I SEEM
SO YOU WERE NOT AWARE SHE WAS MARRIED
I THANK YOU ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THE COUNT IS VERY WELL A GLEAM OF DEEP HATRED PASSED INTO DE WARDES'S EYES
WE SHALL MEET AGAIN MURMURED DE WARDES RISING FROM THE GROUND AND PICKING UP HIS SWORD
AND YET FROM THE SIDE WHERE THE QUEENS WERE NO ONE HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD SAID NOR UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE HAD DONE
SO SET OFF NO DE GUICHE REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE SAID THE CHEVALIER
MARGUERITE ADVANCED A FEW PACES IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT CONTINUE TO ENJOY THE HUMILIATING GRIEF IN WHICH HER RIVAL WAS PLUNGED AND THEN SAID SUDDENLY,--"YOU DO NOT ACCOMPANY ME TO THE DOOR THEN THE MARQUISE ROSE PALE AND ALMOST LIFELESS WITHOUT THINKING OF THE ENVELOPE WHICH HAD OCCUPIED HER ATTENTION SO GREATLY AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONVERSATION AND WHICH WAS REVEALED AT THE FIRST STEP SHE TOOK
WHOEVER SAYS MONTALAIS SAYS MALICORNE
BUT SAID D'ARTAGNAN CHECKING HIM BY A SEVERE LOOK YOUR WORD OF HONOR I GIVE YOU MY SACRED WORD OF HONOR REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN ABOUT TO SET OFF RUNNING
SIRE HAS YOUR MAJESTY PARDONED ME THEN THE KING DID NOT REPLY FOR HE WAS STILL TOO MUCH OVERCOME
DECIDEDLY I WAS WRONG MY LORD
PERSONALLY NONE WHY HATE HIM THEREFORE ASK MY DEAD FATHER THAT QUESTION REALLY MY DEAR DE WARDES YOU SURPRISE ME
SOME ONE IS COMING I THINK AND FORGETFUL OF ALL ETIQUETTE SHE HAD SEIZED THE KING BY THE ARM
HE STANDS WELL ON HIS LEGS BUT HE TROTS HIGH AND MAY CUT HIMSELF WHICH REQUIRES ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO HIS SHOEING
THE COURT OF FRANCE HAS ITS INTOXICATING PROPERTIES WHICH ARE NOT UNLIKE THIS DREAM MY LORD
ANNE OF AUSTRIA WAS ENGAGED IN WRITING AS MONSIEUR ENTERED
AND THAT WHICH I SAID BENEATH THE GREAT OAK WELL THAT IS THE ONLY TRUTH WHAT EXCLAIMED THE KING
THERE MUST SURELY BE A NAME MENTIONED IN THIS REPORT CERTAINLY A NAME IS MENTIONED VERY WELL
DE GUICHE AND THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM
MANICAMP SEEMED ABSORBED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF SOME TRIMMING TO HIS DRESS
DE BRAGELONNE THE YOUNG MAN APPROACHED
SHE WAS MARRIED IN ENGLAND MARRIED EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
AND LEANED HER BACK AGAINST A MAGNIFICENT OAK-TREE ENTWINED WITH IVY AND STUCK THE BUTTERFLY ON THE LONG CANE SHE CARRIED IN HER HAND
I DELIGHT TO SEE YOU SO DISPOSED
MY FRIENDSHIP MY LASTING FRIENDSHIP IS YOURS THERE IS CERTAINLY NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD BEAR ME ANY ILL-WILL FROM THE MOMENT I LEAVE HER NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN RAOUL HEARD THESE WORDS AND COMPREHENDING THAT HIS PRESENCE WAS NOW USELESS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOW ONLY FRIENDLY WORDS TO EXCHANGE WITHDREW A FEW PACES
NOW THIS MATTER IS SETTLED THEREFORE IT REMAINS FOR ME TO ASK WITH THE GREATEST HUMILITY YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR THIS SHAMELESS ACTION AS MOST CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE ASKED IT OF YOUR FATHER IF HE WERE STILL ALIVE AND IF I HAD MET HIM AFTER MY RETURN TO FRANCE SUBSEQUENT TO THE DEATH OF KING CHARLES I THAT IS TOO MUCH M
ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
LET ME FOR THIS ALSO BE INDEBTED TO ONE OF YOUR NAME IT IS FOR YOUR SAKE THEN MADAME FOR MINE ALONE NO ONE WHOM I SHALL LEAVE BEHIND ME WILL VENTURE TO MOCK,--NO PRINCE EVEN WHO SHALL SAY I REQUIRED IT LISTEN TO ME DUKE AND HEREUPON THE DIGNIFIED FEATURES OF THE QUEEN ASSUMED A SOLEMN EXPRESSION

COME COME DE GUICHE RESUMED THE CHEVALIER LAUGHINGLY TELL US YOUR OPINION FRANKLY
SURROUNDING THESE TWO TENTS AND THE SIX OTHERS A HUNDRED OFFICERS GENTLEMEN AND PAGES DAZZLING IN THEIR DISPLAY OF SILK AND GOLD THRONGED LIKE BEES BUZZING ABOUT A HIVE
AND WHOEVER LISTENS TO ME MAY BELIEVE ME DURING THIS CONVERSATION MADAME HER HEAD STRETCHED FORWARD WITH EAGER EAR AND DILATED GLANCE ENDEAVORING TO PENETRATE THE OBSCURITY THIRSTILY DRANK IN THE FAINTEST SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
HE WOULD HAVE TURNED HIM INTO VERSE IF HE HAD THE PRINCE AND HIS COURT CHATTING IN THIS MANNER RETURNED TO THE COOLEST APARTMENTS OF THE CHATEAU
THEY WOULD BE LOST WERE IT NOT FOR THAT MOST FORTUNATE PRINCIPLE OF INSTINCT WHICH URGES THEM TO CHANGE SUDDENLY AND PUNISH THE MAN WHOSE DEVOTION THEY SO RECENTLY ACCEPTED A VERY LEARNED DISSERTATION SAID MONTALAIS IN THE TONE OF THOROUGH ENJOYMENT
IT WAS M
A FEW WORDS WILL PROVE TO THE READER THAT NO ONE BUT OEDIPUS IN PERSON COULD HAVE SOLVED THE ENIGMA IN QUESTION
MARTINIER JUNE 1660
YES THEY ARE ENTERING THE WOOD
I CERTAINLY
YOU HARD AND SAVAGE AS YOU WISH TO APPEAR WILL BE SIGHING ALL THE WHILE
HE HAD SCARCELY LEFT WHEN FOUQUET KNITTING HIS BROWS FELL INTO A DEEP REVERIE
AT ST GERMAIN THE PRINCESS AND HER MOTHER HAD CHANGED THEIR HEAVY TRAVELING CARRIAGE SOMEWHAT IMPAIRED BY THE JOURNEY FOR A LIGHT RICHLY DECORATED CHARIOT DRAWN BY SIX HORSES WITH WHITE AND GOLD HARNESS
AS FOR YOU MY DEAR LADY REST EASY
AS REGARDS MYSELF YOU WISH TO AROUSE A FEELING OF DEEP DISLIKE AGAINST A MAN OF HONOR--MY FATHER'S FRIEND AND MY OWN
WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON MALICORNE HAD INSTALLED HIMSELF IN THE CHESTNUT-TREE IN THE VERY PLACE MANICAMP HAD JUST LEFT DETERMINING WITHIN HIMSELF TO SUCCEED HIM IN THE ONE HE NOW OCCUPIED
DE BRAGELONNE
DE BRAGELONNE
DE BRAGELONNE
DE BRAGELONNE
SEND TOBY HERE HE SAID
AT LEAST SO IT IS SUPPOSED BUT YOU WHO KNOW EVERYTHING KNOW VERY DIFFERENTLY I KNOW THAT THE KING IS GREATLY AND SUDDENLY CHANGED
AM I NOT RIGHT
WE WILL GO TOGETHER RAOUL YOU OVERPOWER ME WITH YOUR KINDNESS MONSIEUR HOW DO YOU THINK HIS MAJESTY IS AFFECTED TOWARDS ME MONSIEUR YES EXCELLENTLY WELL DISPOSED YOU KNOW THAT TO BE SO CONTINUED THE COUNT
I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING SAID I WAS FRIVOLOUS AND A COQUETTE OR SOMETHING WORSE PERHAPS
DURING THE LAST FEW HOURS SPENT IN LE HAVRE EVERY PREPARATION FOR THE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN MADE
YOU ARE DEFICIENT IN LOYALTY OF CONDUCT
IT WAS NOT THAT HE WAS MEAN IN CHARACTER OR HUMBLE IN SPIRIT
I SAID A KING IS IT NOT ALL THE SAME NO ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU YOU WILL DO SO SHORTLY THEN
AND THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT THE NAIAD WHO RESIDES IN THAT LITTLE STREAM STOPPED ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO COME AH SAID SAINT-AIGNAN
OH OH SAID ARAMIS IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT
HE REACHED PARIS DURING THE NIGHT AND ALIGHTED AT A SMALL HOTEL WHERE IN HIS PREVIOUS JOURNEYS TO THE CAPITAL HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PUT UP AND AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE HOTEL GRAMMONT
ONE MIGHT EVEN BOLDLY SAY HE WAS THE KING OF SHEPHERDS A SUBDUED MURMUR OF APPROBATION ENCOURAGED THE NARRATOR WHO CONTINUED:--"HIS STRENGTH EQUALS HIS COURAGE
ARAMIS'S GLANCE AS WELL AS HIS OWN PLUNGED AT THE SAME MOMENT THROUGH THE APERTURE HE HAD MADE
TO AN AFFILIATED MEMBER OF THE FIRST OR SECOND YEAR REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN LOOKING INQUIRINGLY AT THE MONK I SHOULD SAY--A FEVER THAT MAY BE CURED BUT TO ME SAID THE FRANCISCAN
AND SO MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE'S NAME IS NOT TO BE MET WITH IN THE SONG NO INDEED AND ARE YOU SATISFIED THEN PERFECTLY
A COQUETTE MAY DRIVE HIM OUT OF HIS SENSES BUT WILL NEVER MAKE HIM FALL IN LOVE
I COULD NOT RETURN BEFORE TO-MORROW AND HE TOOK THE TWENTY PISTOLES
JEALOUS
LET US MAKE ROOM FOR THEM SAID FOUQUET SMILING AND PULLING ARAMIS BY HIS CLOAK
ADIEU VILLIERS,--FAREWELL FOREVER REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN AND HE FLED ENDEAVORING TO MASTER HIS EMOTIONS
WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO INTERROGATE HIM MYSELF INQUIRED ARAMIS
THE NEXT DAY I COULD NOT BEAR HER OUT OF MY SIGHT
THE FELLOW DENOUNCED HIMSELF IN ORDER TO GET IMPRISONED HERE AND WHAT WAS HIS OBJECT NONE OTHER THAN TO RETURN TO MY KITCHEN AT THREE FRANCS A DAY THREE FRANCS--POOR DEVIL THE POET MY LORD BELONGS TO THE LOWEST SCALE THE SAME STYLE OF BOARD AS THE SMALL TRADESMAN AND BAILIFF'S CLERK
LET YOUR GRACE FINISH THE RECITAL THEN AND TELL M
WHY WE HAVE LOST OURSELVES NOT QUITE SO BAD AS THAT SIRE WHERE DOES THAT GATE LEAD TO TO ROND-POINT SIRE WHERE WERE WE GOING WHEN WE HEARD THE SOUND OF WOMEN'S VOICES YES SIRE AND THE TERMINATION OF A CONVERSATION IN WHICH I HAD THE HONOR OF HEARING MY OWN NAME PRONOUNCED BY THE SIDE OF YOUR MAJESTY'S YOU RETURN TO THAT SUBJECT TOO FREQUENTLY SAINT-AIGNAN YOUR MAJESTY WILL FORGIVE ME BUT I AM DELIGHTED TO KNOW THAT A WOMAN EXISTS WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE OCCUPIED ABOUT ME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE AND WITHOUT MY HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT
YOU REMEMBER MY DEAR BAISEMEAUX THE KING'S GUARDSMAN WITH WHOM WE USED FORMERLY TO HAVE SUCH DELIGHTFUL MEETINGS IN THE CARDINAL'S TIME PERFECTLY SAID ATHOS TAKING LEAVE OF HIM WITH AFFABILITY
IT MUST BE SO ADDED THE QUEEN
HIS SMILE HOWEVER CHANGED ITS EXPRESSION AND FROM ITS FORMER FRANKNESS BECAME MOCKING IN ITS EXPRESSION
SHE IS A GOOD SORT OF GIRL WHOM WE SHALL FIND AMUSING ENOUGH
YOUR FACE PLEASES ME M
WITH ONE HAND SHE HELD BACK THE BRANCHES WHICH WOULD HAVE STRUCK HER FACE AND WITH THE OTHER SHE RAISED THE HOOD OF THE MANTLE WHICH COVERED HER SHOULDERS
IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY
YOU COULD NEVER CONVINCE ME FOR I TELL YOU BEFOREHAND I DO NOT WISH TO BE CONVINCED
MY LETTERS AND THE SEALS UNBROKEN MONSIEUR YOUR LETTERS DID NOT FIND AT BLOIS THE PERSON TO WHOM THEY WERE ADDRESSED AND SO THEY ARE NOW RETURNED TO YOU MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE HAS LEFT BLOIS THEN EXCLAIMED RAOUL
SHE SMILED AND WITHOUT TURNING HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM BUT GIVING ONLY TO THE TONE OF HER VOICE THAT INFLECTION OF GENTLE REPROACH AND LANGUID IMPERTINENCE WHICH WOMEN AND PRINCESSES SO WELL KNOW HOW TO ASSUME SHE MURMURED I HAVE ALREADY HINTED MY LORD THAT YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES NOT A SINGLE DETAIL ESCAPED RAOUL'S ATTENTION
IS IT FOR ME SHE MURMURED THAT THE KING REMAINS THUS UNCOVERED AND EXPOSED TO THE RAIN
MELICORNE MALICORNE MONSEIGNEUR I SHALL NEVER GET HOLD OF THAT NAME YOU SAY MANICAMP VERY WELL MONSEIGNEUR OH I OUGHT TO SAY MALICORNE VERY WELL TOO
DE WARDES'S REPROACHES TO REPROACH MYSELF FOR IT AND VERY BITTERLY TOO
D'ARTAGNAN AND HE WOULD HAVE MET WITH A BAD RECEPTION IF HE HAD COME TO TELL ME ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS FORTUNATE BUT HE ALSO SAID MUCH GOOD OF THAT YOUNG MAN AND WITH JUSTICE SAID THE MUSKETEER
AS THIS WINDOW HAPPENED TO BE MADAME'S SAINT-AIGNAN CONCLUDED THAT THE FORM IN QUESTION MUST BE THAT OF DE GUICHE
THE FRANCISCAN MADE A RAPID AND IMPERIOUS MOVEMENT OF HIS HAND
WELL GO ON MONSIEUR THE MONEY THE KING HAS REQUIRED YOU TO SUPPLY YOU UNDERSTAND MARQUISE THAT I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO PROCURE IT THEN TO GET IT COUNTED AFTERWARDS REGISTERED--ALTOGETHER A LONG AFFAIR
YOU FIND ME BRUTAL AND FOOLISH
I REGRET TO HAVE OCCASION TO TROUBLE YOU IN THIS MANNER I WOULD WILLINGLY ESCORT THE COMTE DE LA FERE SAID SOME ONE IF I HAD NOT TO SPEAK TO MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WHO IS THAT SAID D'ARTAGNAN LOOKING INTO THE DARKNESS
AND IN ORDER THAT THE WIFE SHOULD NOT BE OF ONE PARTY WHILST THE HUSBAND BELONGED TO THE OTHER A SITUATION WHICH PRESENTS SERIOUS INCONVENIENCES PARTICULARLY WITH CHARACTERS LIKE THOSE OF THE FUTURE CONSORTS--MALICORNE HAD IMAGINED THE IDEA OF MAKING THE CENTRAL POINT OF UNION THE HOUSEHOLD OF MONSIEUR THE KING'S BROTHER
AND I FEEL HERE HERE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF MY HEART A DEEP-SEATED GRIEF A DEJECTION I CANNOT OVERCOME SOMETHING HEAVY PASSIONLESS DEATH-LIKE,--RESEMBLING A CORPSE
FAUCHEUX YOU WILL TAKE AWAY WITH YOU BOTH THE GOLD AND SILVER PLATE
I RECOGNIZE IT WELL
I FELT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO CONTEST WITH THEM AND I THEREFORE WITHDREW THIS EXTREME DIFFIDENCE SHOWS A WANT OF COMMON SENSE
MADAME DE BELLIERE HAD IN FACT LEFT FOUQUET ABOUT AN HOUR PREVIOUSLY AFTER HAVING PASSED TWO DAYS WITH HIM
I DO NOT SUSPECT MADAME
DO NOT BE ANGRY SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
THE EXPENSES HAVE BEEN PAID AND NOTHING HAS TRANSPIRED OF OUR DESIGNS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SOLDIERS THE KING WISHED TO SEND THERE I HAVE RECEIVED NEWS THIS MORNING THEY ARRIVED THERE FIFTEEN DAYS AGO AND HOW HAVE THEY BEEN TREATED IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE FORMER GARRISON THE SOLDIERS WERE LANDED AT SARZEAU AND THEN TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY TO QUIMPER AND THE NEW GARRISON BELONGS TO US FROM THIS VERY MOMENT ARE YOU SURE OF WHAT YOU SAY MY DEAR MONSIEUR DE VANNES QUITE SURE AND MOREOVER YOU WILL SEE BY AND BY HOW MATTERS HAVE TURNED OUT STILL YOU ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT OF ALL THE GARRISON TOWNS BELLE-ISLE IS PRECISELY THE VERY WORST I KNOW IT AND HAVE ACTED ACCORDINGLY
I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU BESTOW YOUR AFFECTIONS YOU BECOME EXCLUSIVELY ATTACHED
THE CONSEQUENCE THEREFORE WAS THAT AS MADAME DID NOT OPENLY EXHIBIT ANY APPROBATION NO ONE FELT AUTHORIZED TO APPLAUD NOT EVEN MONSIEUR WHO SECRETLY THOUGHT THAT SAINT-AIGNAN DWELT TOO MUCH UPON THE PORTRAITS OF THE SHEPHERDESSES AND HAD SOMEWHAT SLIGHTINGLY PASSED OVER THE PORTRAITS OF THE SHEPHERDS
NAY MORE THAN A GREAT FAULT A GREAT CRIME YOU SIRE I HAVE OFFENDED YOUR MAJESTY NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE IN THE WORLD REPLIED LOUIS XIV
IT WAS THE MOST GRACEFUL PICTURE POSSIBLE
FOUQUET A VISIT EARLY TO-MORROW MORNING I WILL DO SO
FOUQUET KNOWING THEM TO BE FRIENDS OF HIS HAD FROM THAT MOMENT DONE ALL HE POSSIBLY COULD TO PREVENT THEIR GETTING WEARIED OR BORED UPON HIS ESTATES
LET ME STILL LEAD YOU DARLING
THANKS LOUISE FOR THIS DEVOTION
A VESSEL CHARTERED FROM LIMA ENTERED THE PORT OF LISBON LAST WEEK
WHAT SHOULD I SAY SIRE EXCEPT THAT TO GIVE SUCH AN ADVICE WOULD BE TO SUPPLY ARMS AGAINST MYSELF
YOU HE SAID
THERE IS A CHANCE FOR YOU NAY NAY SAID ARAMIS COLDLY
THE BATHS SAID MONSIEUR TO HIMSELF
AT THE END OF ALMOST EVERY WALK EVIDENTLY IN GREAT TRIBULATION AND UNEASINESS THE STARTLED DEER WERE SEEN HURRYING TO AND FRO FIRST STOPPING FOR A MOMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND THEN RAISING THEIR HEADS THEY FLED WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW OR BOUNDED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST WHERE THEY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
PROBABLY I SHALL NOT BE ABSENT MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT LA VALLIERE PRESSED HER HAND UPON HER HEART WHICH FELT AS THOUGH IT WERE BREAKING
THE PLAN IS A BOLD ONE
I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT OBSERVING THAT YOUR SHIRT WAS STAINED SAID BUCKINGHAM
THEN WE ARE AGREED
IT'S A FINE ONE IS IT NOT VERY MUCH SO A CARPET BEAUTIFUL I'LL WAGER HE HAD NOTHING LIKE IT BEFORE HE CAME HERE I THINK SO TOO AND THEN AGAIN TURNING TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID DO YOU NOT REMEMBER TO HAVE BEEN VISITED AT SOME TIME OR ANOTHER BY A STRANGE LADY OR GENTLEMAN YES INDEED
SO MUCH THE BETTER AND SHE EMPHASIZED THE SO MUCH THE BETTER AS IF SHE HAD INSTEAD SAID SO MUCH THE WORSE A FEW MINUTES SILENCE ENSUED
THEN PLACING THE BOOK UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED IT AT THE LETTER M AND SHOWED ARAMIS THE FOLLOWING NOTE IN THE COLUMN OF OBSERVATIONS
THE TALE WHICH WAS RELATED TO YOU IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS AND BY MADAME HERSELF IS UTTERLY FALSE
HIS PROGRESS WAS HOWEVER ARRESTED BY THE QUEEN
SAINT-AIGNAN WHO HAD ONLY BEEN SEEKING FOR INFORMATION HAD MET WITH AN ADVENTURE
MADAME SAW THEREFORE OR RATHER FANCIED SHE SAW THINGS UNDER THEIR TRUE ASPECT
IT IS USUALLY SPLIT INTO THREE OR FOUR PARTS AND THE FINAL PORTION IS ENTITLED THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
ANSWER ME
ANSWER ME
DE BRAGELONNE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOM ONE COULD LOOK AT WITH PLEASURE
IF I WERE TO RIDE FIFTEEN LEAGUES IN THESE CLOTHES THEY WOULD NEVER BE FIT TO PUT ON AGAIN
COLBERT SO IT IS STATED IT IS VERY CLEAR SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF THE PLOT OF BELLE-ISLE I WAS TOLD THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THE FORTIFICATIONS THERE HAD TURNED OUT TO M
LOVE ME THEN SAID THE PRINCESS SINCE IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY SHE PRESSED HIS FINGERS RAISING HIM THUS PARTLY IN THE MANNER OF A QUEEN AND PARTLY AS A FOND AND AFFECTIONATE WOMAN WOULD HAVE DONE
YOU HAVE NO PITY--YOU ARE KILLING ME WHAT IS THE MATTER IN FACT THEN YOU DISTINCTLY SAY YOU EXPERIENCE NOTHING WHEN NEAR ME OH SIRE
I WAS OBSERVING MY LORD
YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME IN NO LITTLE DEGREE FROM THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CONVERSATION
DO NOT DEPEND UPON ME M
A CHARMING MAID OF HONOR MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS AH AH
I DO NOT ASK IF YOU LOVE RAOUL YOUR CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND,--YOUR BROTHER
WITH REGARD TO THAT I THINK WHAT THAT MANICAMP HAS CREDIT WITH NO ONE BUT YOURSELF MONSIEUR LE COMTE HE WILL NOT BE AT LE HAVRE THEN WHEREUPON MALICORNE MADE ANOTHER MOVEMENT
I NEEDED BUT THIS SAID MONTALAIS IN DESPAIR
NO SPACE TO MOVE ABOUT NO GAYETY NO CHEERFUL SOCIETY NO GAMBLING PERMITTED
SHE THEN RESUMED HER SEAT OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN WEAKNESS WHICH WAS NO DOUBT ASSUMED FOR A DELIGHTFUL COLOR ANIMATED HER CHEEKS AND HER EYES STILL RED FROM THE TEARS SHE HAD RECENTLY SHED NEVER HAD MORE FIRE IN THEM
WITH THIS SIGN YOU WILL EDIFY
FOUQUET HAS COLBERT REPLIED HIS FACE DARKENING WITH A SINISTER EXPRESSION OF PLEASURE
D'ARTAGNAN WAS ONE OF THOSE CELEBRATED AND TERRIBLE FOUR MEN WHO WERE CALLED THE MUSKETEERS THAT THEY MAY BE
IF YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL EMBARRASSED I ALWAYS SPEAK THE TRUTH MONSEIGNEUR
ARE YOU AWARE MY LORD HE SAID LOWERING HIS VOICE THAT YOUR EXTRAVAGANCES VERY MUCH RESEMBLE THE EXCESSES OF JEALOUSY
EMBROIDERED COATS AND SILK SASHES WERE LOST
HAVE A HORSE SADDLED AND SET OFF NOT I AND WHY NOT MORBLEU DON'T YOU KNOW THEN THAT M
HIS EYES FLASHED LIGHTNING CAUSING DE WARDES INVOLUNTARILY TO FALL BACK
IF HE HAS NOT WRITTEN TO YOU HE HAS WRITTEN TO ME AH
WHAT A WICKED SHEPHERDESS SAID MADAME
CHAPTER LVIII
THE REMEDY IS FOUND EASILY ENOUGH EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
LET US HURRY FORWARD SAID RAOUL TO DE GUICHE FOR IF I READ BUCKINGHAM'S CHARACTER ARIGHT HE WILL CREATE SOME DISTURBANCE WHEN HE LEARNS THE RESULT OF OUR DELIBERATIONS OF YESTERDAY NEVER FEAR SAID DE GUICHE DE WARDES IS THERE WHO IS DETERMINATION ITSELF WHILE MANICAMP IS THE VERY PERSONIFICATION OF THE ARTLESS GENTLENESS DE GUICHE WAS NOT HOWEVER THE LESS DILIGENT ON THAT ACCOUNT AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THEY WERE WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOTEL DE VILLE
THAT IS TO SAY IMPREGNABLE
WHY SINCE I TELL YOU THAT IT IS A PROJECT OF CONJUGAL AFFECTION IT IS NECESSARY I SHOULD TAKE MY WIFE WITH ME IN THAT CASE MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE COMTE I AM GREATLY CONCERNED BUT NO DE GUICHE FOR YOU BAH YES.--WHY DO YOU TAKE MADAME WITH YOU BECAUSE I BEGIN TO FANCY I LOVE HER SAID THE PRINCE
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IT IS THE CASE THOUGH HE DOES ME TOO MUCH HONOR THE FACT IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE HERE HE IS FULL OF KINDNESS AND ATTENTION BUT WHEN YOU ARE GONE HE MAKES ME SUFFER A PERFECT MARTYRDOM
D'ARTAGNAN FOR YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN GET ME OUT OF MY TROUBLE IN WHAT WAY YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE ABBE D'HERBLAY AND YOU KNOW THAT HE IS A SOMEWHAT MYSTERIOUS GENTLEMAN YES WELL YOU CAN PERHAPS GIVE ME THE ADDRESS OF HIS PRESBYTERY FOR I HAVE BEEN TO NOISY-LE-SEC AND HE IS NO LONGER THERE I SHOULD THINK NOT INDEED
SPARE ME AND FORGET YOURSELF NO LONGER
BUT I HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO ANY ONE BUT YOURSELF AND YOU UNDERSTAND MONSEIGNEUR THAT I PERFECTLY RELY ON YOUR DISCRETION OH BE EASY DO YOU STILL WISH TO SEE THE NOTE CERTAINLY WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS MANNER IN CONVERSATION THEY HAD RETURNED TO THE GOVERNOR'S APARTMENTS
DO NOT FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF THIS BRANCH THEN BUT LISTEN TO ME I AM LISTENING AND I AGREE TO DO SO
I WANT A ROOM SAID MANICAMP
HE WILL RISE HE WILL BE SUPERINTENDENT IT IS PROBABLE
YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN LA VALLIERE IS SAID TO BE VERY STRICT IN HER IDEAS YOU EXCITE MY CURIOSITY AND I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE HER AGAIN
SHE WILL HELP YOU I DARE SAY BY DEVIATING A LITTLE FROM THE EXACT TRUTH ESPECIALLY IF SHE KNOWS THAT YOUR HIGHNESS IS KIND ENOUGH TO INTEREST YOURSELF ABOUT ME VERY WELL I THINK I HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT IT IS BEST FOR YOU ALL TO PRETEND HOW DELIGHTFUL YOU HAD BETTER SAY THAT ALL THREE OF YOU WERE PERFECTLY WELL AWARE THAT THE KING WAS BEHIND THE TREE OR BEHIND THE THICKET WHICHEVER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MELT IT DOWN AND RETURN ME ITS VALUE IN MONEY AT ONCE IT SHALL BE DONE YOUR LADYSHIP YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PLACE THE MONEY IN A CHEST AND DIRECT ONE OF YOUR CLERKS TO ACCOMPANY THE CHEST AND WITHOUT MY SERVANTS SEEING HIM
THEN FALLING DOWN AGAIN SAID CALL TO YOUR PEOPLE OR I SHALL BE DROWNED HALLOA
YOU SMILE SAID BAISEMEAUX
STAY SAID HE
SEVEN LIVRES THE COURIER FOURTEEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE TRIED THESE MEANS UPON MADAME
OH YOU ARE THINKING OF ME ARE YOU
YOU ARE AFRAID OF HAVING OFFENDED THE KING AND I WISH TO TRANQUILLIZE YOU BY ASCERTAINING MYSELF IF IT WERE POSSIBLE YOU COULD HAVE BEEN OVERHEARD OH YES MADAME THE KING WAS CLOSE TO US STILL YOU WERE NOT SPEAKING SO LOUD THAT SOME OF YOUR REMARKS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LOST WE THOUGHT WE WERE QUITE ALONE MADAME THERE WERE THREE OF YOU YOU SAY YES
THE COMPLIMENT ALTHOUGH FLATTERING WAS NOT THE LESS SOMEWHAT POINTED
ANOTHER SET OF MUSICIANS
DEEP EXCLAIMED THE CHEVALIER
HER TWO COMPANIONS AGAIN BURST OUT LAUGHING
LAST YEAR YOU SEEMED TO INTEREST YOURSELF IN HIM YES I DID SO WELL AS YOUR INTEREST IS ALL-POWERFUL HERE MY LORD I HAVE TREATED HIM SINCE THAT TIME AS A PRISONER AT FIFTEEN FRANCS THE SAME AS THIS ONE THEN SAID ARAMIS WHO HAD CONTINUED TURNING OVER THE LEAVES AND WHO HAD STOPPED AT ONE OF THE NAMES WHICH FOLLOWED MARTINIER
MONTALAIS WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT BLUSH SUFFICIENTLY TO PREVENT HER LOOKING AT THE KING AND SHE SAW HIM FIX HIS EYES DEVOURINGLY ON MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
YOU ARE GOING TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT WELL YES SAID SHE HANGING ROUND HIS NECK WITH CHILDISH INDOLENCE RATHER THAN WITH LOVING ABANDONMENT
THE FACT IS HE SAID LOOKING AT HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT A MAN MUST BE EITHER A DUKE OR A PEER TO FILL THAT POST ALL I SOLICIT SAID MALICORNE IS A VERY HUMBLE APPOINTMENT
BUT AS MONSIEUR WAS A MAN WHO THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIMSELF AND USUALLY ADDED VERY LITTLE TO THE GENERAL PLEASURE HIS ABSENCE WAS RATHER A SUBJECT OF SATISFACTION THAN REGRET
THEY ARRIVED IN THIS MANNER AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE BAISEMEAUX RUBBING HIS HANDS AND GLANCING AT THE HORSE FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE ARAMIS WAS LOOKING AT THE BLEAK BARE WALLS
BUT IF I WERE AT ALL CURIOUS IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL CARPETED ROOM AND ITS LODGER FURNITURE IS VERY COMMONPLACE
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH TODAY IS THE LAST VOLUME OF THE FOUR-VOLUME EDITION
THE MARQUISE HOWEVER HAD ENTERED HER OWN ROOM AND WAS INSPECTING HER CASKET OF JEWELS WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION
I REMARKED THAT MY PRESENCE WAS DISAGREEABLE TO WHOM TO MADAME WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID THE DUKE IN ASTONISHMENT
HE STARTED AND DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM LA VALLIERE WHOM HE HAD TILL THAT MOMENT HELD PRESSED AGAINST HIS HEART
THE BLUEPRINTS FOR THE ISLAND ALTHOUGH IN PORTHOS'S HANDWRITING SHOW EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER SCRIPT THAT HAS BEEN ERASED THAT OF ARAMIS
AND THE POOR DEVIL FOR WHOM THE SMALLER ROOM IS DESTINED IS A TRICK IN ORDER TO BETTER CONCEAL DE GUICHE OR MANICAMP
FOR HE HAD SEATED HIMSELF LIKE A MONKEY UPON THE WALL THE FOLIAGE OF THE WILD VINE AND HONEYSUCKLE CURLED AROUND HIS HEAD LIKE A FAUN WHILE THE TWISTED IVY BRANCHES REPRESENTED TOLERABLY ENOUGH HIS CLOVEN FEET
ON THE THIRTY-FIRST OF MAY EVERY YEAR M
ATHOS LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS HEART WAS TOUCHED BY PITY
ARAMIS UNABLE TO BEAR THIS SCENE ANY LONGER WITHDREW AS FAR AS THE LANDING
AS I WAS LOOKING AT THE MONK THEY ENTERED THE HOTEL
IN CONFESSION OH
D'ARTAGNAN RESUMED DE WARDES WHO HAD OBSERVED THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY MEANS OF STINGING RAOUL SO AS TO AWAKEN HIS ANGER
THAT IS AN EVIL THOUGHT WHICH HAS JUST CROSSED YOUR MIND HOW DO YOU DETECT IT MADAME BY THE SMILE THAT HAS JUST MARRED THE EXPRESSION OF YOUR COUNTENANCE
DE WARDES HAD RESERVED THIS INJURY FOR THE LAST
BRING M
MADAME HAD NOT ANTICIPATED THIS DENOUEMENT
THEY WILL BECOME ANXIOUS AND WILL BE LOOKING FOR US FEAR NOTHING SAID THE YOUNG MAN SMILING WE ARE NEITHER OF US OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE FOR OUR ABSENCE TO BE REMARKED BUT I HAVE MY DUTY TO PERFORM M
THE KING EXCLAIMED MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS IN HER ASTONISHMENT LETTING LA VALLIERE'S HEAD FALL UPON THE GROUND
BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY RECOVERING HERSELF SHE LAUNCHED A LAST PROJECTILE AT HER ADVERSARY
I AM AN ENGLISHMAN AND IN MY TURN I PROPOSE TO YOU WHAT YOU PROPOSED TO OTHERS TO NO PURPOSE
AND I TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOUR MAJESTY
HE GOES TO BED EARLY FOR MY POOR OLD SERVANT GETS EASILY FATIGUED
EVERYTHING WHICH IS TOO HIGHLY PLACED FOR ME YOU ARE INDIFFERENT TO IS FOREIGN TO ME AS BEING PROHIBITED AND I SAID THE KING DO NOT FIND THAT YOU ARE AT MY COURT ON THE FOOTING YOU SHOULD BE
MOST CERTAINLY I DID NOT SAY I COULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT THAT WHICH WAS THE MOST PRECIOUS OBJECT IN LIFE FOR ME COULD BE WORTHLESS
DEAR MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED HURRIEDLY CLOSING THE DOOR THINGS CANNOT GO ON AS THEY ARE NOW ANNE OF AUSTRIA RAISED HER BEAUTIFUL EYES TOWARDS HIM AND WITH AN UNMOVED SUAVITY OF MANNER SAID WHAT DO YOU ALLUDE TO I WISH TO SPEAK OF MADAME YOUR WIFE YES MADAME I SUPPOSE THAT SILLY FELLOW BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN WRITING A FAREWELL LETTER TO HER OH
RAOUL WAS THEN PRESENTED AND WAS MOST GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED
BUT AT ALL EVENTS HE DID EMBRACE HIM
AND BENDING DOWN THE FAMOUS BRANCH AGAINST WHICH HE HAD DIRECTED SUCH BITTER COMPLAINTS HE SUCCEEDED BY THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS HANDS AND FEET IN SEATING HIMSELF SIDE BY SIDE WITH MONTALAIS WHO TRIED TO PUSH HIM BACK WHILE HE ENDEAVORED TO MAINTAIN HIS POSITION AND MOREOVER HE SUCCEEDED
THE MANEUVER WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE YOUNG MEN MET IN AN OPEN SPACE WHICH WAS LEFT VACANT BETWEEN THE GROUPS OF PLAYERS AND THE GALLERY WHERE THEY WALKED STOPPING NOW AND THEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAYING A FEW WORDS TO SOME OF THE GRAVER COURTIERS WHO WERE WALKING THERE
IT IS EVIDENT THAT IF SHE WERE COMPELLED TO DECIDE BETWEEN THE PECUNIARY VALUE AND THE ARTISTIC BEAUTY MONTALAIS WOULD UNHESITATINGLY HAVE PREFERRED DIAMONDS TO CAMEOS AND HER DISINCLINATION THEREFORE TO PASS THEM ON TO HER COMPANION LA VALLIERE WAS VERY GREAT
ONE OF YOUR MAIDS OF HONOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE HAS JUST FAINTED INDEED
YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM IS A MAN OF UNDOUBTED COURAGE WHO HAS ALREADY FOUGHT TEN DUELS AND WILL PROBABLY FIGHT ELEVEN
UPON MY WORD YOUR GRACE SAID DE WARDES WE SHALL HARDLY HAVE TIME TO BEGIN
BAISEMEAUX DE MONTLEZUN'S ACCOUNTS
I AM A PRISONER THEN IN FRANCE--IF FRANCE IS A PRISON--YES WHAT MUST I DO THEN I WILL TELL YOU
I SAID ALMOST ROYAL AND I SPOKE CORRECTLY SINCE SHE WILL BE SISTER-IN-LAW TO THE KING A THUNDERBOLT FALLING UPON THE CASTLE OF BLOIS WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY MORE THAN THE LAST SENTENCE OF MONTALAIS
YOU SEEM TO COME ON A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE SAID HE TO RAOUL AFTER HE HAD EMBRACED HIM POINTING TO A SEAT
I CERTAINLY KNOW THOSE TWO HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING UPON THE TOP STEP OF THE SMALL STAIRCASE
HOW COULD I HAVE THOUGHT HOW COULD I HAVE SAID WHAT I DID AND SAYING THIS HER HEAD BOWED LIKE THE WATER TOSSED PLUME OF A BULRUSH
FAUCHEUX SHE SAID I BELIEVE YOU SUPPLIED ME WITH MY GOLD SERVICE I DID YOUR LADYSHIP I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER THE AMOUNT OF THE ACCOUNT OF THE NEW SERVICE MADAME OR OF THAT WHICH M
IN THE FIRST PLACE IN ORDER NOT TO WEARY THE READER'S PATIENCE WE WILL HASTEN TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION
MADEMOISELLE MONTALAIS MURMURED MALICORNE
HIS DRESS CONCEALED THE BLOOD AND HIS SMILE THE RAGE WHICH DEVOURED HIM
ALL THESE SUFFERINGS SUCCESSES AND REMARKS WERE BLENDED CONFOUNDED AND LOST IN THE UPROAR OF APPLAUSE
HE HAS NO MONEY THEN I SUPPOSE SAID DE GUICHE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
DE WARDES YOU ARE WRONG WRONG
TO BE BOARDED AT FIFTY FRANCS AS PRINCES OF THE BLOOD IN FACT BUT THE CARDINAL MUST HAVE SEEN HIS MISTAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
I DO NOT NEED YOUR FRIENDSHIP MADAME
BUT I KNOW AT WHAT COST TO THEMSELVES IS THE HOSPITALITY WHICH THE POOR EXTEND TO A SICK MONK AND I PREFERRED THIS HOTEL WHERE MOREOVER I WAS EXPECTED THE LANDLORD LOOKED AT THE FRANCISCAN IN AMAZEMENT BUT THE LATTER WITH HIS THUMB MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS IN A PECULIAR MANNER UPON HIS BREAST
FAUCHEUX'S DISPOSAL SHE SAID
WHEREUPON THE EMBARRASSMENT OF BAISEMEAUX BECAME VISIBLY GREATER
THAT PALACE WHICH HAD BEEN SO INHOSPITABLE A RESIDENCE FOR THE UNHAPPY DAUGHTER OF HENRY IV THE NAKED WALLS THE UNEVEN FLOORINGS THE CEILINGS MATTED WITH COBWEBS THE VAST DILAPIDATED CHIMNEY-PLACES THE COLD HEARTHS ON WHICH THE CHARITY EXTENDED TO THEM BY PARLIAMENT HARDLY PERMITTED A FIRE TO GLOW WAS COMPLETELY ALTERED IN APPEARANCE
YES IN THE DUNGEONS AH
I WISH TO KNOW WHY YOU WENT AWAY IN THAT CASE MONSEIGNEUR I WILL TELL YOU
WHAT A FUTURE BEFORE US SILLY SILLY GIRLS MURMURED LOUISE
MADAME HASTENED TO LOOK FOR MONSIEUR FOR SHE INSTINCTIVELY UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD BEEN FAR TOO LONG KEPT FROM SHARING IN THIS JOY
THIS AFFAIR TOOK PLACE IN 1626 AT A PERIOD HAPPILY FOR YOURSELVES KNOWN TO YOU BY TRADITION ONLY AT A PERIOD WHEN LOVE WAS NOT OVER-SCRUPULOUS WHEN CONSCIENCES DID NOT DISTILL AS IN THE PRESENT DAY POISON AND BITTERNESS
BELIEVE ME BRAGELONNE I AM SUFFERING ALL THE TORMENTS OF HELL
AND EVERY ONE ON LEAVING THE ROOM SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM
AND IN THIS MANNER IT WILL BE SEEN THAT SHE HAD EXERCISED ALL HER INFLUENCE OVER THE MINDS OF HER MAIDS OF HONOR AND WITH ALL ITS ACCOMPANYING DETAILS HAD ARRANGED THE COMEDY WHICH HAD JUST BEEN ACTED
SHE IS A CAPITAL GIRL OR RATHER A GOOD-SORT-OF-FELLOW OF A NYMPH A GENTLE LAUGH FOLLOWED AND THIS TIME THE LOOKS WERE SO DIRECT THAT MONTALAIS FELT HERSELF BLUSHING ALMOST SCARLET
IT IS THE PROVINCE OF M
AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE THOUGHT OF MADAME
YOU ASK ME SHE EXCLAIMED IF I LOVE RAOUL THE FRIEND OF MY CHILDHOOD,--MY BROTHER ALMOST NO NO NO
THE KING RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE CARD-TABLES WERE SET OUT
THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE THEREFORE HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL LIKE AN UNEMPLOYED HERON APPEARING TO QUESTION EARTH AIR AND WATER ABOUT IT
IT HAD BEEN REPORTED THAT HE WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS
SINCE BY THEIR MEANS THIS EVENING I SHALL HAVE WON OVER A HEART TO MY SIDE AT THE SAME TIME FATHOMED AN IMPORTANT SECRET THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE DESERTED RECESS IN HER ROOM SHE SAID ADDRESSING VACANCY,--"IS IT NOT THUS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ACTED MY POOR CHEVREUSE
IT IS NOT EVERY ONE WHO IS HAPPY ENOUGH TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES OF SERVING HIS SOVEREIGN WITH DISTINCTION
IT IS GRATIFYING TO BE LOVED YOU KNOW
AND THAT IN FACT IF HE HAD EXPECTED TO BE ADORED BY ALL THE LADIES OF THE COURT FROM THE VERY FIRST FROM A CONFIDENT RELIANCE ON HIS MERE APPEARANCE IT WAS A PRETENSION WHICH WAS MOST PREPOSTEROUS AND INSULTING EVEN FOR CERTAIN PERSONS WHO FILLED A HIGHER POSITION THAN OTHERS AND THAT A LESSON TAUGHT IN SEASON TO THIS ROYAL PERSONAGE WHO ASSUMED TOO HIGH AND HAUGHTY A CARRIAGE WOULD BE RENDERING HIM A GREAT SERVICE
DID YOU REMAIN THERE LONG SCARCELY A DAY DID YOU SEE MUCH OF IT WHILE YOU WERE THERE ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN IN A DAY A GREAT DEAL CAN BE SEEN WITH OBSERVATION AS KEEN AS YOURS SAID FOUQUET
WAS THE LETTER NOT SIGNED NO SAID THE LANDLORD OPENING HIS EYES VERY WIDE FULL OF MYSTERY AND CURIOSITY
GOOD EVENING M
GOOD EVENING M
BUT AS FOR MY HEART IT WAS LOUIS AGAIN PERCEIVED THAT IN ORDER TO FILL ONE GULF HE WAS ABOUT TO DIG ANOTHER
IN THE SPACE OF FIVE HOURS THE CARPENTERS HAD PUT TOGETHER ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTS CONNECTED WITH THE BUILDING
MONSIEUR MY SWORD WAS IN MY HAND IMMEDIATELY MY ADVERSARY PLACED HIMSELF ON GUARD I STRUCK HIS SWORD OVER THE PALISADE AND THREW HIM AFTER IT WHY DID YOU SUFFER HIM TO LIVE THE KING HAS PROHIBITED DUELLING AND AT THE MOMENT I WAS AN AMBASSADOR OF THE KING VERY WELL SAID ATHOS BUT ALL THE GREATER REASON I SHOULD SEE HIS MAJESTY WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO ASK HIM AUTHORITY TO DRAW MY SWORD AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAS INFLICTED THIS INJURY UPON ME IF I DID NOT ACT AS I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME DID I REPROACH YOU RAOUL STILL THE PERMISSION YOU ARE GOING TO ASK FROM THE KING I WILL IMPLORE HIS MAJESTY TO SIGN YOUR MARRIAGE-CONTRACT BUT ON ONE CONDITION ARE CONDITIONS NECESSARY WITH ME MONSIEUR
LET US TRY FOR THE POST THEN THE CANDIDATE HAD PERSISTED
YOU SHOULD HAVE ADDED MONSIEUR SINCE YOU ARE SO IMPARTIAL THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH YOU HAVE JUST RELATED HAPPENED I WAS NOT ONE-AND-TWENTY YEARS OF AGE A RENEWED MURMUR WAS HEARD BUT THIS TIME OF ASTONISHMENT AND ALMOST OF DOUBT
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WERE THERE AND THAT YOU WISHED TO AMUSE YOURSELF AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHO WERE LISTENING OH MADAME AT THE KING'S EXPENSE
I WAS SURE OF IT
FOR DOES NOT M
THE EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE THRONG AMIDST ALL THE TEDIOUSLY SLOW PREPARATIONS WAS RATHER THAT OF CUPIDITY THAN CURIOSITY
THE POPE MUST DIE HE SHALL DIE SAID ARAMIS QUIETLY
THE PRINCE HAS THE FATHER AND THAT TERRIBLE DRAGON OF A MANICAMP HAS THE SON
FOUQUET YOU WERE WANTING IN JUDGMENT
DE BRAGELONNE SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MY BROTHER WHO WILL BE DELIGHTED TO PAY TO THE SON A PORTION OF THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE HE CONTRACTED WITH THE FATHER THE COMTE DE LA FERE MADAME HAS BEEN ABUNDANTLY RECOMPENSED FOR THE LITTLE SERVICE HE HAD THE HAPPINESS TO RENDER THE KING BY THE KINDNESS MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM AND IT IS I WHO WILL HAVE TO CONVEY TO HIS MAJESTY THE ASSURANCE OF THE RESPECT DEVOTION AND GRATITUDE OF BOTH FATHER AND SON DO YOU KNOW MY BROTHER NO YOUR HIGHNESS
YOU HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
THE WEATHER WAS VERY FINE
OH HEAVENS SAID THE KING AS HE READ THE NOTE
FOR IT IS KNOWN THAT THE GREATEST CHARACTERS ARE THOSE WHO FLATTER THEMSELVES THE MOST IN THE COMPARISONS THEY DRAW BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND OTHERS BETWEEN OTHERS AND THEMSELVES
I'LL TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT BUT WHO IS THAT COMING THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE RAOUL
AND WHAT IS MORE I UNDERSTAND YOUR HEART TOO COMTE THERE IS NO OCCASION THEREFORE REPLIED THE COMTE TO TELL YOUR MAJESTY THAT MY OBJECT IS TO MAKE THESE CHILDREN OR RATHER RAOUL HAPPY AND I TOO AS MUCH AS YOURSELF COMTE WISH TO SECURE M
THE KING WE HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED REMAINED NEAR LA VALLIERE AND THROWING HIMSELF OFF HIS HORSE AT THE MOMENT THE DOOR OF HER CARRIAGE WAS OPENED HE OFFERED HER HIS HAND TO ALIGHT
THAT HOWEVER MATTERS BUT LITTLE TO YOU PROVIDED YOU ARE PAID FOR WHAT HAS BEEN ENGAGED THE LANDLORD BOWED LOWER STILL
SHE WOULD THEN RING TO SUMMON M
AT THE TERMINATION OF THE CEREMONY THE KING AND QUEEN PASSED ONWARD TOWARDS THE GRAND RECEPTION-ROOM WHERE MADAME AND HER SUITE WERE TO BE PRESENTED TO THEM
AND LASTLY I DID NOT DISPLAY TEN TIMES MORE DIPLOMACY THAN M
IT SHALL SHINE SO DAZZLINGLY THAT THE QUEENS AND MONSIEUR WILL BE ALMOST BLINDED BY IT TAKE CARE SIRE TAKE CARE IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHAT HAVE I DONE THEN I SHALL BEGIN TO RECALL THE COMPLIMENTS I PAID YOU JUST NOW
IF IT WERE SO I SHOULD BE ALARMED AT THE THREAT YOU HOLD OUT
FOR TWELVE YEARS HE HAS KNOWN YOU LOVED YOU AND YET--ONE CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT--HE HAS NEVER EVEN KISSED THE TIPS OF YOUR FINGERS TELL US THE REASON OF THIS CRUELTY YOU WHO ARE ALL HEART SAID ATHENAIS TO LA VALLIERE
I UNDERSTAND YOU REPLIED LOUIS SMILING
POOR LOUISE HE THOUGHT HAS COME HERE ONLY WITH AN HONORABLE OBJECT IN VIEW AND UNDER HONORABLE PROTECTION
HE WOULD FORFEIT HIS CHARACTER OF INFALLIBILITY AND INVIOLABILITY
THE KING RECEIVED HIS FIRST NEXT THE QUEEN-MOTHER THEN MONSIEUR THEN THE QUEEN AND MADAME AND SO ON
YES YOU HAVE RENDERED THE ORDER A GREAT SERVICE
WE HAVE CITIZENS AND BARRISTERS AT FIVE FRANCS AND DO THEY EAT TOO NOT A DOUBT ABOUT IT
WE WERE SPEAKING OF BELLE-ISLE SAID FOUQUET WITH THAT USAGE OF SOCIETY AND THAT PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE OF LOOKS WHICH REQUIRE HALF A LIFETIME THOROUGHLY TO ACQUIRE AND WHICH SOME PERSONS NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR STUDY NEVER ATTAIN
SINCE THERE ARE NO WARS HERE NOW I WILL FLEE YONDER TO THE NORTH SEEK SERVICE IN THE EMPIRE WHERE SOME HUNGARIAN OR CROAT OR TURK WILL PERHAPS KINDLY PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY DE GUICHE DID NOT FINISH OR RATHER AS HE FINISHED A SOUND MADE HIM START AND AT THE SAME MOMENT CAUSED RAOUL TO LEAP TO HIS FEET
MY HEART IS ENGAGED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AND I POSITIVELY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE GIRL IN THE LEAST OH OH SAID ARAMIS YOUR HEART IS ENGAGED YOU SAY
WHILE THE KING NO LONGER EXPERIENCED FOR MADAME ANY REMAINS OF THE PASSION HE HAD ONCE FELT FOR HER THERE WAS IN THIS SAME EAGERNESS OF MADAME TO PROCURE INFORMATION ABOUT HIM GREAT GRATIFICATION FOR HIS VANITY FROM WHICH HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF
BUCKINGHAM STEPPED ASIDE AND WATCHED THE COMBAT
I BELIEVE MADAME IS JEALOUS SIRE LA VALLIERE REPLIED FIRMLY
I IMPLORE YOU MY DEAR SISTER SAID THE KING ADVANCING TO TAKE HER WARM AND THROBBING HAND WHICH SHE ABANDONED TO HIM
COME LET US WALK ON THE KING SPOKE UNTRULY FOR NOTHING ON THE CONTRARY COULD MAKE HIM LESS ANXIOUS BUT HE HAD A PART TO PLAY AND SO HE WALKED ON HURRIEDLY
ALL WOMEN WHO ARE POSSESSED OF ANY FEELING DO AND ONE NEVER FINDS THEM DULL OR LONELY WHEN REMOVED FROM THE GIDDY VORTEX OF THESE EXCITING AMUSEMENTS
BESIDES I HAVE ALREADY SENT FOR A CONFESSOR OH
DE GUICHE'S ATTENTIONS TO MADAME DO NOT CONCERN ME NO MONSEIGNEUR
SINCE YOU UNDERSTAND,--FOR YOU DO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND DO YOU NOT PERFECTLY VERY WELL
I SEE AFFLICTION AND RESTRAINT IN THESE LINES
HE WAS SITTING ON A STOOL HIS ELBOW RESTING ON AN ARMCHAIR AND WITH ALL THE UPPER PART OF HIS BODY RECLINING AGAINST IT
ARAMIS SLOWLY ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE DYING MAN WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE FIRST ATTACK OF THE AGONY WHICH HAD SEIZED HIM
THE SENTINEL AT THE LODGE ADVANCED AS THE CARRIAGE WAS ABOUT TO PASS UNDER THE ARCH AND THE GOVERNOR OPENED THE CARRIAGE-DOOR HIMSELF SETTING THE EXAMPLE OF OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS
MONSIEUR FOUQUET WILL NOT LAST AS LONG AS MY SPANISH BLADE IS IT POSSIBLE SAID ATHOS SMILING THAT MY FRIEND D'ARTAGNAN WHO AFTER HAVING RAISED ME TO THE SKIES MAKING ME AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP CASTS ME DOWN FROM THE TOP OF OLYMPUS AND HURLS ME TO THE GROUND
IS MONTALAIS DOUBLED THEN VILE FELLOW!--IT IS YOU WHO ARE DOUBLED
AS FOR DE GUICHE BURIED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS HE REMAINED SEATED WITH HIS HEAD TIGHTLY PRESSED BETWEEN HIS HANDS
AMONG THE ADMIRERS OF THESE SPLENDID TOILETTES OUR FRIEND MALICORNE WAS CONSPICUOUS
LEAVE ME TO MY RUIN LEAVE ME TO SINK BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE HATREDS WHICH SURROUND ME BENEATH THE FAULTS I HAVE COMMITTED BENEATH THE LOAD EVEN OF MY REMORSE BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MADAME DO NOT OVERWHELM ME WITH THIS LAST INFLICTION A SHORT TIME SINCE M
THEY EAT AS MUCH AS A PRISONER OF THE FIFTH ORDER WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RABBITS AND FOWLS THEY KILL WAS ARAMIS REALLY LISTENING OR NOT
FLY
DAME RESUMED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY
SUFFICIENTLY MEDITATIVE IN HER LIVELIEST HUMORS TO MAKE EVEN POETS MEDITATE
FORGIVE MY INQUIRY
RECEIVED ME WITH KINDNESS--PERHAPS SO--YES THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT HE RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT YOU RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION QUITE TRUE AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT
DO YOU REALLY SAY WHAT YOU MEAN I SAY IT RELUCTANTLY SIRE REPLIED THE GRAND-DAUGHTER OF HENRY IV FIRMLY HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYES FLASHING
MADEMOISELLE DE VALLIERE IS BELOVED BY ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS SAINT-AIGNAN STARTED
FOR NO ONE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT FROM THE INTERIOR FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS SECRETED I COULD SEE TO THE VERY END OF THE ROOM NOW LISTEN TO ME SAID FOUQUET LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE LACKEY
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW SHE WAS USUALLY STYLED MY LADY WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANY NAME TO THAT DESCRIPTION YES I KNOW THAT GOOD HEAVENS MURMURED BUCKINGHAM
DE GUICHE HIS FAVORITE THE PRINCESS AT THIS REPLY WAS CONSTRAINED TO CHECK AN INSTINCTIVE TENDERNESS OF FEELING WHICH THE COURAGE DISPLAYED BY THE COUNT HAD AWAKENED
AND PROVIDED I CAN GET A STABLE FOR A DOZEN HORSES AND A SUITABLE HOUSE IN A GOOD QUARTER CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME VERY EXCELLENT HOUSES WELL THEN BUT NOT FOR US WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SAYING NOT FOR US?--FOR WHOM THEN FOR THE ENGLISH OF COURSE FOR THE ENGLISH YES
BUT YOU ADDED THAT IF I PERSISTED YOU DO PERSIST THEN RAOUL STAMMERED OUT AN ALMOST UNINTELLIGIBLE ASSENT
IT IS A GOOD THING FOR HIM THAT HE IS A PRINCE OF SUCH HIGH RANK THAT HE HAS AN ARMY TO SAFEGUARD FOR HIM THAT WHICH IS HIS OWN BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANICAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
I AM ASHAMED TO HAVE GONE SO FAR BUT MY ANGER CARRIED ME AWAY AND I ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR IT;--FORGET IT TOO DEAR VISCOUNT SAID THE DUKE PRESSING WITH HIS OWN THE VIGOROUS AND VALIANT HAND OF HIS COMPANION ALLOW ME ON THE CONTRARY TO REMEMBER IT AND TO LOOK AFTER YOUR SAFETY
BUT YOU KNOW THAT MAN PROPOSES AND GOD DISPOSES,--_VERBA VOLANT SCRIPTA MANENT WHICH IS AS MUCH TO SAY THAT WHAT IS SPOKEN FLIES AWAY AND WHAT IS WRITTEN REMAINS
NOT A WOOD NYMPH NOR A DRYAD THAT COST LESS THAN A HUNDRED FRANCS A DAY
PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS FOOLISH WHEN THEY WEEP
THIS MANICAMP IS A REGULAR VAMPIRE:--HE IS CARRYING ON A TRADE IN IT NO MONSIEUR LE COMTE HE WISHES TO MAKE A PRESENT OF IT TO WHOM TO MYSELF MONSIEUR WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO AT ONCE MY DEAR M
HE OFFERED HIS HAND TO MADAME WITHOUT LOOKING AT MONSIEUR HIS BROTHER AND LED THE YOUNG PRINCESS TO THE DOOR OF HER APARTMENTS
LOUIS HAD NONE OF HIS BROTHER'S GLOOMINESS BUT WAS PERFECTLY RADIANT
THE SENATOR'S NAME WAS SIGNOR MARINI.--A SCOTTISH LAIRD WITH SEVEN HIGHLANDERS OF HIS CLAN ALL ON FOOT
BAISEMEAUX WHO CARRIED THE KEYS OPENED THE DOOR
I AM PERFECTLY WELL AWARE RETURNED MONSIEUR THAT THE SUBJECT IS A DELICATE ONE BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN TELL ME EVERYTHING
HE CAN TERMINATE IT WHENEVER HE PLEASES AND RETURNING FROM HIS VOLUNTARY EXILE HE WILL MEET WITH SMILES FROM ALL LIPS
THE VENETIAN SUBMITTED TO THE SAME FORMALITIES AS HIS TWO PREDECESSORS HESITATED AS THEY HAD DONE AT THE SIGHT OF THE TWO STRANGERS BUT HIS CONFIDENCE RESTORED BY THE ORDER OF THE GENERAL HE REVEALED THAT THE POPE TERRIFIED AT THE POWER OF THE ORDER WAS WEAVING A PLOT FOR THE GENERAL EXPULSION OF THE JESUITS AND WAS TAMPERING WITH THE DIFFERENT COURTS OF EUROPE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR ASSISTANCE
THAT'S WELL YES BUT MY DEAR M
THOSE ARE INDEED GREAT ADVANTAGES AND SOUVENIRS REPLIED THE QUEEN ALLUDING IN SPITE OF HERSELF TO RECOLLECTIONS FROM WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE VOLUNTARILY TO DETACH ONE'S SELF
I LOVE MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE ABOVE EVERYTHING
WE COULD FIGHT IN ENGLAND OR EVEN UPON MY YACHT WE ARE EXCEEDINGLY WELL PLACED HERE MY LORD
REALLY MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN YOU EXCITE MY CURIOSITY
WHEN ONE HAS A FRIEND AS POWERFUL AS MINE WE DO NOT PUBLISH HIS NAME IN THAT FASHION IN OPEN DAY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY BE STOLEN FROM US YOU ARE RIGHT MONSIEUR TO BE SILENT AS TO THAT NAME
BUT AT LEAST YOU MAKE A CHOICE WHY NO
THREEFOLD LOVE
SHE SEEMED NOT TO HEAR EITHER OF THE WHISPERINGS WHICH AROSE FROM THE COURT
WE ARE GOING SAID HE COME M
FOR HIS WEIGHT AND THE REBOUND HAD ALMOST UPSET THE BOAT
YOU HAVE LOST FOUR MILLIONS,--IMPOSSIBLE MONSIEUR COLBERT HELD MY CARDS FOR ME REPLIED THE SUPERINTENDENT WITH A SIMILAR BITTER LAUGH
FOR THEN AT LEAST MONSIEUR HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FRIGHTENING THOSE WHO ANNOYED HIM
HE THEN LEFT THE ROOM CARRYING THE PAPERS OF THE DEAD MAN WITH HIM
I HAVE PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR MAJESTY HE STAMMERED OUT
IN 1661 YOU PERCEIVE SAID BAISEMEAUX EIGHTY ENTRIES
I MEAN IN FACT THAT THOSE WHO MAY BE JEALOUS WILL BE WRONG IF THEY SUPPOSE YOU COME TO MY APARTMENTS FOR MY SAKE SINCE YOU WILL GO THERE FOR MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WHO HAPPENS TO BE LAME HARDLY THAT WHO NEVER OPENS HER LIPS BUT WHO WHEN SHE DOES OPEN THEM DISPLAYS A BEAUTIFUL SET OF TEETH WHO MAY SERVE AS A MODEL FOR AN OSTEOLOGIST YOUR FAVOR WILL CHANGE HER APPEARANCE HENRIETTA AT ALL EVENTS YOU ALLOWED ME TO CHOOSE ALAS
THE FOUR BECOME FAST FRIENDS AND WHEN ASKED BY D'ARTAGNAN'S LANDLORD TO FIND HIS MISSING WIFE EMBARK UPON AN ADVENTURE THAT TAKES THEM ACROSS BOTH FRANCE AND ENGLAND IN ORDER TO THWART THE PLANS OF THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU
TO-MORROW WE SHALL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN YES TO-MORROW SAID FOUQUET SHAKING HIS HANDS LIKE A MAN RETURNING TO HIS SENSES
BAISEMEAUX DE MONTLEZUN HAD OCCASIONED HIS VISIT
FOR LOOK MY LORD HE IS REDOUBLING HIS ATTENTIONS TO MADAME TO PREVENT YOUR EFFACING THE IMPRESSION HE HAS MADE MONSIEUR MADE A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE BUT AS HE NOTICED A SMILE OF TRIUMPH PASS ACROSS THE CHEVALIER'S LIPS HE DREW UP HIS HORSE TO A FOOT-PACE
YOUR MAJESTY BELONGS NOT TO YOURSELF ALONE
ARE YOU SURPRISED THEN THAT I AM STILL THINKING OF SAINT-MANDE OF SAINT-MANDE EXCLAIMED MADAME DE BELLIERE
LA VALLIERE ROSE
THE MARQUISE PERCEIVED WITH SORROW RATHER THAN INDIGNATION THAT THE KING WAS AN ACCOMPLICE IN THE PLOT WHICH BETRAYED THE DUPLICITY OF LOUIS XIII
SAINT-AIGNAN'S PLAN WAS AS FOLLOWS
HE SOUGHT HIS BROTHER'S TRIUMPHANT LOOK AS IF TO ASK HIM IF HE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE VENGEANCE TAKEN
NOW AND THEN A RABBIT OF PHILOSOPHICAL MIEN MIGHT BE NOTICED QUIETLY SITTING UPRIGHT RUBBING HIS MUZZLE WITH HIS FORE PAWS AND LOOKING ABOUT INQUIRINGLY AS THOUGH WONDERING WHETHER ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE APPROACHING IN HIS DIRECTION AND WHO HAD JUST DISTURBED HIM IN HIS MEDITATIONS AND HIS MEAL WERE NOT FOLLOWED BY THEIR DOGS OR HAD NOT THEIR GUNS UNDER THEIR ARMS
THE KING HAD DIRECTED THAT FONTAINEBLEAU SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE COURT AND EVERY ONE WAS USING HIS UTMOST INTEREST TO GET INVITED
THERE IS ONLY ONE ERASURE AH AH
BUT THE TRUTH IS IT IS NOT VERY APPARENT SO EASY IS IT TO GROW RUSTY IN THE COUNTRY
THESE ARE THE LEAVINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOUR-FRANC PRISONERS
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE FINANCES HAS SENT ME 500,000 PISTOLES I THANK YOUR HIGHNESS
WHO ARE THOSE WITH WHOM YOU CANNOT CONTEND
I HAVE NOT EVEN BELLE-ISLE BAH
AND THEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE LEFT ME PRECIPITATELY TO RETURN TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE LET US HOPE THEN THAT I SHALL BE AS FORTUNATE AS YOURSELF
IT IS NOT A YOUTHFUL MONARCH BUT A BEING OF HIGHER ORDER WHO REIGNS OVER FRANCE ONE WHOM PLEASURE HAPPINESS AND LOVE ACKNOWLEDGE AS THEIR MASTER THE KING COLORED
AND FROM HER WELL-STORED ARSENAL ISSUED GLANCES KINDLY RECOGNITIONS AND A THOUSAND OTHER LITTLE CHARMING ATTENTIONS WHICH WERE INTENDED TO STRIKE AT LONG RANGE THE GENTLEMEN WHO FORMED THE ESCORT THE TOWNSPEOPLE THE OFFICERS OF THE DIFFERENT CITIES SHE PASSED THROUGH PAGES POPULACE AND SERVANTS
THE CHEVALIER THREW THE LETTER OVER HIS SHOULDER UPON AN ADJOINING TABLE AND SAID IN A DISDAINFUL TONE IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE
IS IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY YOUR SIGNATURE AT THE FOOT OF THAT LETTER IS WORTH A MILLION
HAS MONSIEUR EVER SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT ME OFTEN HAS HE EVER SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT HIS JEALOUSY MORE FREQUENTLY STILL OF HIS JEALOUSY OF ME NO BUT OF THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AND DE GUICHE WELL MADAME MONSIEUR'S PRESENT IDEA IS A JEALOUSY OF MYSELF REALLY REPLIED THE PRINCESS SMILING ARCHLY
THE PROMENADE IN FACT WAS NOT ILL-TIMED ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO WERE DREAMERS OR LOVERS
DE WARDES STILL MAINTAINED THE SAME UNBROKEN SILENCE
WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW MY DEAR COMTE INQUIRED MANICAMP
WHY DO THEY RUN AWAY AT THE VERY SIGHT OF ME HE INQUIRED IN A SUPERCILIOUS TONE
A FEW OF THE PERSONS PRESENT FOLLOWED THE KING AS HE QUITTED THE APARTMENT
HE WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE STEP I HAD TAKEN AND WOULD HAVE THOUGHT KINDLY OF ME FOR IT
SUCH IN TWO WORDS WAS THE WOOF OF PETTY INTERESTS AND PETTY CONSPIRACIES WHICH UNITED BLOIS WITH ORLEANS AND ORLEANS WITH PAIRS
HE ESPECIALLY CHEERED DE GUICHE BY POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT MADAME WOULD BEFORE LONG SUCCEED IN GOVERNING HER HUSBAND AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THAT MAN WOULD GOVERN MONSIEUR WHO SHOULD SUCCEED IN INFLUENCING MADAME
AND THE NUMBER OF TENDER AND WITTY REMARKS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASCRIBED TO YOU WOULD MAKE MADEMOISELLE DE SCUDERY AND HER BROTHER BURST FROM VERY SPITE IF THEY WERE FAITHFULLY REPORTED BUT DEAREST MONTALAIS SAID THE POOR GIRL YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANY ONE EXACTLY WHAT I SAID SINCE YOU WERE PRESENT WHEN I SAID IT YES I KNOW
AS I AM AN ENGLISHMAN I AM AFRAID OF NOT COMPREHENDING IT VERY CLEARLY
YOUR MAJESTY THOUGHT THAT I HAD BEEN WASTEFULLY LAVISH IN EXPENDITURE NOT SO
SINCE YOU THEREFORE ARE SO TERRIBLY INCENSED TAKE ME AS A REMEDY
GO MONSIEUR TAKE CARE OF ONE OF THE BEST OF SOLDIERS AND WHEN YOU HAVE REPOSED A LITTLE COME AND PLACE YOURSELF AT MY DISPOSAL SIRE ABSENT OR PRESENT I AM ALWAYS YOURS D'ARTAGNAN BOWED AND RETIRED
ON HIS SIDE SAINT-AIGNAN KNEW THAT DE GUICHE HAD HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH LA VALLIERE'S INTRODUCTION TO MADAME'S HOUSEHOLD FOR A COURTIER KNOWS EVERYTHING AND FORGETS NOTHING
MALICORNE IS GOING TO HAVE ME APPOINTED MAID OF HONOR M
PRIDE WILL INDUCE HIM TO FURNISH THE MONEY AND WHEN HE HAS NO MORE HE WILL FALL IT IS TRUE SAID THE MARQUISE TREMBLING
THEN THE DEPUTIES IN VERSES MORE OR LESS AMUSING COMPARED THE KING TO THE SUN MADAME TO PHOEBE THE SUN'S SISTER AND THE QUEEN AND MONSIEUR WERE NO MORE SPOKEN OF THAN IF THE KING HAD MARRIED HENRIETTA OF ENGLAND AND NOT MARIA THERESA OF AUSTRIA
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS LEARNED ALSO BUT IT IS MY TURN--DO YOU NOT REMEMBER THAT IF ONE OF THE TERMS WERE GIVEN WE WERE TO FIND THE OTHER
THE CONFESSION SEEMED A SINGULAR ONE
MONSIEUR RAN RATHER THAN WALKED TOWARDS THE ANTE-CHAMBER WHERE NOTICING AN USHER IN ATTENDANCE HE GAVE HIM SOME DIRECTIONS IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
DE GUICHE LEFT DE WARDES AND MALICORNE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GRAND STAIRCASE WHILE HE HIMSELF WHO SHARED THE FAVOR AND GOOD GRACES OF MONSIEUR WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE WHO ALWAYS SMILED AT HIM MOST AFFECTIONATELY THOUGH HE COULD NOT ENDURE HIM WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCE'S APARTMENTS WHOM HE FOUND ENGAGED IN ADMIRING HIMSELF IN THE GLASS AND ROUGING HIS FACE
VERY FORTUNATELY HIS HORSE WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY RESTIVE ENABLED HIM BY A SUDDEN PLUNGE TO CONCEAL HIS AGITATION
BUT THE JESUITS ARE THE CLOSEST AT HAND
I SHOULD SIMPLY SAY,--'MY GOOD LOUISE YOU HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH M
AND AS FOR THE COUNT YOU WISH HIM TO LOVE ONE WHO IS DESTINED FOR YOUR MASTER
THE THIRD NOVEL THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SERIALIZED OCTOBER 1847 JANUARY 1850 HAS ENJOYED A STRANGE HISTORY IN ITS ENGLISH TRANSLATION
IN WHICH WE AT LENGTH SEE THE TRUE HEROINE OF THIS HISTORY APPEAR
ARE ALL THE MAIDS OF HONOR IN FRANCE THEN UNDER HIS PROTECTION MALICORNE BOWED
I AM INFORMED MONSEIGNEUR STAMMERED THE CARDINAL
YOU SEE WE ARE FAR BETTER INFORMED THAN YOURSELF
YES OH WILL SHE NOT SUIT YOU SIRE WHY LOOK HOW THIN THE POOR CHILD IS
THEIR PROGRESS IT MIGHT BE SAID WAS MAJESTIC
DEAREST SHE SAID HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME
I AM READY TO HEAR YOU
SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS WERE FORMED IN THE RECESSES OF THE WINDOWS LIKE SOLDIERS STATIONED IN THEIR DIFFERENT TOWERS WHO BELONG TO THE SAME GARRISON
D'ARTAGNAN TO-DAY IT IS THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM YOU KNOW VERY WELL MONSIEUR RETURNED DE WARDES THAT I SOMETIMES INSULT THOSE WHO ARE PRESENT DE WARDES WAS CLOSE TO RAOUL THEIR SHOULDERS MET THEIR FACES APPROACHED AS IF TO MUTUALLY INFLAME EACH OTHER BY THE FIRE OF THEIR LOOKS AND OF THEIR ANGER
NOT AT ALL REPLIED THE CHEVALIER NOT AT ALL
YOU WHO BELONG TO THE CHURCH OUGHT TO KNOW THAT WELL IF HAD ANY CURIOSITY IT WOULD BE TO SEE THE POOR AUTHOR OF THE DISTICH VERY WELL WE WILL SEE HIM TOO
I HAVE TOLD YOU SO ALREADY AND I REPEAT IT REPLIED ARAMIS WITH GLISTENING EYES AND TREMBLING LIPS
NO DOUBT SAID THE KING
HE CAN PAY A COMPLIMENT WITH A CHARM OF MANNER WHOSE FASCINATION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST
D'ARTAGNAN IS
NO SIGHED THE KING THAT IS TRUE YOU KNOW VERY WELL SIRE THAT IF IT WERE TO CONTINUE I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO MAKE A DISTURBANCE
SIRE INTERRUPTED THE YOUNG GIRL IT HAS CEASED RAINING
MISERABLY SO GREAT WEAKNESS OF NATURE RETURNED ATHENAIS
THE TWO YOUNG MEN APPROACHED STILL CLOSER CONVERSING IN ANIMATED TONES
OBEY SAID THE FRANCISCAN IN A TONE OF COMMAND IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST
IT IS THE HANDSOME DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM AH YES I REMEMBER MADAME'S KNIGHT ADDED THE FAVORITE WITH AN INFLECTION OF THE VOICE WHICH ENVIOUS MINDS CAN ALONE GIVE TO THE SIMPLEST PHRASES
BUT IF YOUR MAJESTY WERE TO ASK ME WHICH OF THE TWO CITIES LONDON OR PAIRS I SHOULD PREFER AS A RESIDENCE I SHOULD BE FORCED TO ANSWER PARIS ANNE OF AUSTRIA OBSERVED THE ARDENT MANNER WITH WHICH THESE WORDS HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED
DE WARDES FLEW UPON RAOUL WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT AT THE FIRST CLASHING OF THE STEEL BLADES BUCKINGHAM CLEARLY SAW THAT RAOUL WAS ONLY TRIFLING WITH HIS ADVERSARY
AND SURPRISE NEED NOT BE EXCITED WITH RESPECT TO MADAME
THESE PROCEEDINGS WERE EAGERLY DEVOURED BY THE EYES OF MONTALAIS AND MALICORNE WHO MUTUALLY EXCHANGED THEIR OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUBJECT
IN HOC SIGNO VINCES 9 CLOSE THE DOOR CONTINUED THE FRANCISCAN AFTER A PAUSE
FOR THIS OCCASION AND THIS PLAN SAID THE FRANCISCAN
IF THE IDEA SHOULD OCCUR TO ME AGAIN OF TAKING A DISLIKE TO THE COURT OH
IT IS HOWEVER AN ACT OF CONSCIENCE ON MY PART
DE GUICHE I INDEED
HOW DID DE GUICHE LOOK SUPERB DEAR FELLOW
HE LOVED FROM AMBITION
THE KING CONTINUED PITILESSLY
CLERK I AM MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS DEMOISELLE I AM MONSIEUR MALICORNE ALAS I KNOW IT WELL AND YOU OVERWHELM ME BY YOUR RANK
BESIDES SAINT-AIGNAN WAS THE MODEL OF COURTIERS PAST PRESENT AND TO COME
HE OPENED IT AND READ--"COME QUICKLY I HAVE A THOUSAND THINGS TO SAY TO YOU THE KING AND MADAME HAD NOT BEEN SEPARATED A SUFFICIENTLY LONG TIME FOR THESE THOUSAND THINGS TO BE THE RESULT OF THE THREE THOUSAND WHICH THEY HAD BEEN SAYING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE ROUTE WHICH SEPARATED VULAINES FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
THE NUMBER OF BOLTS GRATINGS AND LOCKS FOR THIS SINGLE COURTYARD WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR THE SAFETY OF AN ENTIRE CITY
MONSIEUR GRISART EMPTY AND CLEAN THIS GLASS
PAY YOUR COURT IN DUE FORM AND WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE
HE DID NOT HOWEVER THE LESS ON THAT ACCOUNT SALUTE THEM WITH A VERY LOW BOW WHICH THEY RETURNED WITH INTEREST
LA VALLIERE FELL UPON HER KNEES AND THAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT THE SOUND COULD BE HEARD UPON THE HARD FLOOR
THAT IS WELL SIRE I ASK BUT ONE THING MORE REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN.--"MY DISCHARGE WHAT
DE BRAGELONNE HAS HONORED ME BY ASKING MY HAND IN MARRIAGE BUT WELL IT SEEMS THE KING WILL NOT CONSENT TO IT EH
CALL M
HER HAIR STILL DAMP AND BLACKER THAN JET HUNG IN HEAVY MASSES UPON HER WHITE AND DELICATE NECK
DID SHE REALLY SAY THAT WORD FOR WORD AND SHE THINKS SO LA VALLIERE ALWAYS THINKS WHAT SHE SAYS THAT POSITIVELY CRIES ALOUD FOR VENGEANCE
I DEFY HIM TO DO SO UNLESS HE BE THE VILEST OF MEN AND MY HEART ASSURES ME THAT IT IS NOT SUCH A MAN I WOULD CHOOSE
WHY DID THEY LET HIM LEARN LATIN
IT WOULD INDEED BE TRULY MAGNIFICENT BUT DO YOU SUPPOSE MONSIEUR THAT HIS MAJESTY WOULD DEIGN TO ACCEPT MY INVITATION I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER OF IT CRIED COLBERT HASTILY
MADEMOISELLE LA BAUME LE BLANC DE LA VALLIERE IS A YOUNG LADY PERFECTLY WELL-CONDUCTED PERFECTLY WELL-CONDUCTED DO YOU SAY YES THEN YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THE LAST RUMOR EXCLAIMED SAINT-AIGNAN
GO AND TELL M
FOUQUET HAD HARDLY TIME TO RECOVER HIMSELF DURING THE DRIVE
MONTALAIS HOWEVER HURRIED TO HER ASSISTANCE
MADAME'S FOUR CHANCES
A GOOD RACE
CHAPTER LXI
THE CUCKOO STAID HIS MONOTONOUS CRY IN THE RECESSES OF THE FOREST
DE SAINT-AIGNAN FORGIVE ME SIRE WELL I AM NOT SORRY YOU SHOULD BELIEVE ME TO BE AN ADMIRER OF SWEET VOICES AS WELL AS OF BEAUTIFUL EYES
THIS JUNCTURE HAD ARRIVED AND THE HOUSEHOLD WAS ABOUT TO BE ESTABLISHED
AT THIS MOMENT AND AS THE GODDESS OF DISCORD INFLAMING ALL MINDS WAS ABOUT TO DIRECT THEIR SWORDS AGAINST EACH OTHER RAOUL GENTLY PLACED HIS HAND ON BUCKINGHAM'S SHOULDER
BUT YOU POSSESS OTHER PROPERTY MONSIEUR DE VANNES I HAVE NOTHING ELSE SIRE
A WORLD RETURNED ATHENAIS IN WHICH MEN WORSHIP A WOMAN UNTIL SHE HAS FALLEN,--AND INSULT HER WHEN SHE HAS FALLEN WHO SPOKE TO YOU OF FALLING SAID LOUISE
AND IN WHAT RESPECT WITH RESPECT TO A FIGURE
BECAUSE MY HOUSE IS WATCHED
BENEATH THIS OAK THE GARDENERS HAD PILED UP THE MOSS AND TURF IN SUCH A MANNER THAT NEVER HAD A SEAT MORE LUXURIOUSLY RESTED THE WEARIED LIMBS OF MAN OR MONARCH
BUT THE KING MADE A SIGN TO THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR PROGRESS
GONE TO BATHE IN FACT IN THAT CASE YOU WHO ARE ONE OF MONSIEUR'S GENTLEMEN IN WAITING WILL UNDERTAKE TO MAKE MY EXCUSES TO HIM
WHAT I SAID TO HIM COUNT REPLIED RAOUL I WILL REPEAT TO YOU
THE ENGLISH CHARACTER IS NOT ALWAYS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN FRANCE AND THE LIBERTY OF ENGLISH MANNERS SOMETIMES SURPRISES THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS LIBERTY IS ENRICHED BY INNOCENCE AH SAID MONSIEUR MORE AND MORE PIQUED FROM THE VERY MOMENT THAT YOUR MAJESTY ABSOLVES MY WIFE WHOM I ACCUSE MY WIFE IS NOT GUILTY AND I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY PHILIP REPLIED THE KING HASTILY FOR HE FELT THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE MURMURING SOFTLY IN HIS HEART THAT MONSIEUR WAS NOT ALTOGETHER WRONG WHAT I HAVE DONE AND WHAT I HAVE SAID HAS BEEN ONLY FOR YOUR HAPPINESS
THAT HIS MAJESTY LOVED MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY MONSIEUR COULD NOW SLEEP IN PERFECT TRANQUILLITY
THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD INDEED MADE THEMSELVES SMALL--INDEED INVISIBLE
THE MARQUISE STOPPED THE CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR SO WELL KNOWN TO HER ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SEEN IT ONLY ONCE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IT WILL NOW BE REMEMBERED NO LESS PAINFUL THAN THOSE WHICH BROUGHT HER NOW TO IT AGAIN
RAOUL PERCEIVED BUCKINGHAM WHO WAS STANDING A FEW PACES FROM MONSIEUR IN A GROUP OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH WHO WERE ADMIRING HIS ARISTOCRATIC CARRIAGE AND THE INCOMPARABLE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS COSTUME
AH ATHOS SUCH ENCOUNTERS NEVER TAKE PLACE IN THESE TIMES
SUCH IS THE CASE HOWEVER MONSIEUR YOU ARE QUITE SURE OF IT MONSIEUR DE MANICAMP AND AS HE PUT THIS QUESTION HE LOOKED SLYLY AT DE GUICHE AS THOUGH TO INTERROGATE HIM UPON THE DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE TO BE PLACED IN HIS FRIEND'S STATE OF MIND
DE GUICHE HAD NOT YET IN ANY WAY REMARKED THE ANIMOSITY WHICH APPEARED TO INFLUENCE THAT YOUNG NOBLEMAN AGAINST HIM BUT HE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT THERE COULD BE NO SYMPATHY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE FAVORITE OF CHARLES II
DE BRAGELONNE MURMURED LOUISE
IT APPEARS THAT IT IS TALKED ABOUT THEN I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN TO ME ON THE SUBJECT WHO SAID THE PRINCE
THE SITUATION WAS ODD ENOUGH AND SOME KINDLY DISPOSED PERSONS HAD OBSERVED IT
DO NOT FORGET WHAT YOU HAVE JUST THIS MOMENT SAID THAT THIS MORNING'S LESSON OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT AND THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN DOING WHAT WAS WRONG THEY WOULD HAVE HIDDEN THEMSELVES YES I SAID SO WELL JUST NOW REPENTING OF MY HASTINESS OF THE MORNING AND IMAGINING THAT GUICHE WAS SULKING IN HIS OWN APARTMENTS I WENT TO PAY MADAME A VISIT
BUT PROBABLY THE CATASTROPHE WILL BE COMPLETE WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WHY SO FOR THE SIMPLEST OF ALL REASONS,--THAT M
THEY MADE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT ADMITTING ARAMIS WHO ENTERED WITHOUT DISMOUNTING AND THEY POINTED OUT THE WAY HE WAS TO GO BY A LONG PASSAGE WITH BUILDINGS ON BOTH SIDES
TWO WORDS WILL BE SUFFICIENT THAT IS WELL ARRANGED
SHE KNEW THAT THE KING HER AUGUST BROTHER-IN-LAW HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO RIDICULE THE HUMBLE LA VALLIERE AND THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS USUAL CUSTOM IT WAS HARDLY PROBABLE HE WOULD EVER LOVE THE PERSON WHO HAD EXCITED HIS LAUGHTER EVEN HAD IT BEEN ONLY FOR A MOMENT
AT THE VERY MOMENT HE WAS ABOUT ENTERING THE CHATEAU BRAGELONNE MET DE GUICHE
THE CHEVALIER FINDING THAT TIME WAS PASSING AWAY WISHED TO LEAVE
I SAY THAT IT IS A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR YOU NOT MERELY LOVING BUT NOT KNOWING HOW TO CONCEAL YOUR LOVE WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID DE GUICHE
MONTALAIS AND IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE THOUGH TO SAY BAITED RATHER THAN STOCKED IN THE SECOND COUPLET FOOTNOTE 6
HER FEELINGS WERE GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
I HAVE HAD THE POST PROMISED ME SO LONG AND HAVE ENJOYED IT FOR SO BRIEF A PERIOD THAT I AM ALWAYS FORGETTING MY DIGNITY YOU WILL DO ME THIS SERVICE WILL YOU NOT M
YOUR MAJESTY MAY SEE THAT I DO NOT SPEAK TO YOU OF YESTERDAY SHOULD YOU BE GLAD TO SEE THIS YOUNG MAN M
STAY LOOK AT HER
COURSING INDULGED IN FOR BUCKINGHAM HAD HIS GREYHOUNDS WITH HIM
HE CAME FROM BLOIS WITH ME AND I COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN WITHIN DOORS
THE QUEEN OF THE CHASE HAD SEATED HERSELF SOME TWENTY PACES FROM THE BANK ON WHICH LOUIS AND MADAME HENRIETTA WERE RECLINING
YOU CONTINUE STILL ON AN UNFRIENDLY FOOTING THEN HAS HE NOT TOLD YOU ANYTHING NOTHING I DO NOT LIKE THE MAN AND AS I NEVER LIKED HIM THE RESULT IS THAT I AM ON NO WORSE TERMS WITH HIM TO-DAY THAN I WAS YESTERDAY LET US GO THEN THE FOUR DESCENDED THE STAIRS
MALICORNE RESTED HIMSELF FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN PREPARED TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY
THE TIE WHICH UNITED MADAME TO HIS BROTHER WAS OR AT LEAST SEEMED TO HIM AN INSUPERABLE BARRIER
AND WE WILL VENTURE TO SAY REALLY DID SO
AMONG THE GROUPS OF LADIES PRESENT COULD BE HEARD SMOTHERED LAUGHTER AND STEALTHY WHISPERS
GO AND PREPARE WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR A SIMPLE INTERMENT SUCH AS A POOR MONK ONLY WOULD REQUIRE
AS FOR SAINT-AIGNAN HE LET HIS HEAD FALL UPON HIS BREAST AND CONCEALED UNDER A SILLY LAUGH THE EXTREME ANNOYANCE HE FELT
I DO NOT POSSESS THE POETICAL POWERS OF THE COMTE NOR HIS ABILITY TO BRING TO LIGHT THE SMALLEST DETAILS YOU WILL NOT BE LISTENED TO WITH LESS INTEREST ON THAT ACCOUNT SAID THE KING WHO ALREADY PERCEIVED THAT SOMETHING HOSTILE WAS INTENDED IN HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S STORY
THEY LEFT THE ROOM BAISEMEAUX CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM
HE ARRIVED RIDING AT FULL GALLOP HE ENTERED THE CHATEAU
AND IT SHALL TAKE US BACK TO MY HOUSE GET INTO A CARRIAGE TO CROSS A COURTYARD
THIS IDEA NATURALLY ENOUGH WAS THE FIRST TO PRESENT ITSELF TO HER MIND
AND BUCKINGHAM HAD WORSHIPPED THIS COQUETTE ON BOTH KNEES DE GUICHE HAD ONCE LOOKED UPON THIS DIVINITY AS A MERE WOMAN
I KNOW YOU ARE INCAPABLE OF FORFEITING YOUR WORD
THE DANGER IS NOT GREAT
I WISH TO SPEAK I OUGHT TO SPEAK TO THE KING AND I WILL DO SO
MARIA THERESA TOOK THE ARM OF ONE OF HER LADIES OF HONOR AND WITH A SIDE GLANCE TOWARDS THE KING WHO DID NOT PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE THE OBJECT OF THE QUEEN'S ATTENTION ENTERED THE FOREST BY THE FIRST PATH BEFORE HER
NAY NAY FOR PITY'S SAKE MY DEAR MONTALAIS CRIED MANICAMP DEUCE TAKE IT DO NOT GO AWAY
AS FOR THE REST POETS WITS BEAUTIFUL WOMEN ALL WERE RECEIVED BY HER WITH THE AIR OF A MISTRESS SUPERIOR TO HER SLAVES
YOU SUPPOSE ME TO BE BETTER THAN I REALLY AM AND ATTACH A GREATER MERIT TO ME THAN GOD EVER INTENDED SHOULD BE THE CASE
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A FRIEND OF M
BY THE BY I WAS FORGETTING THE SILVER PLATE
A SINGULAR PERSON WAS THIS M
MAZARIN
SUFFICIENTLY PRETTY TO DAZZLE BY HER ATTRACTIONS EVEN AMONG THE PRETTIEST
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR CARRYING MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE TO THE CHATEAU THE KING HURRIED FORWARD HAPPY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF APPROACHING MADAME AND OF SPEAKING TO HER UNDER A COLORABLE PRETEXT
THE WORST NEWS WOULD BE GOOD NEWS IN THAT CASE DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF FOR NOT ONLY AM I VERY UNHAPPY BUT WHAT IS MORE I SEE OTHERS ABOUT ME WHO ARE HAPPY REALLY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU REPLIED RAOUL
YOU ARE MISTAKEN MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL SUDDENLY STEPPING ACROSS THE BARRIER AGAINST WHICH THE PREVIOUS MOMENT THE TWO FRIENDS HAD BEEN LEANING
AND THEN ALSO IN SPANISH ADDED SOME WORDS OF ADVICE WHICH MONSIEUR DID NOT UNDERSTAND
IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND NO INTELLIGENCE HAD YET BEEN RECEIVED OF MADAME
AH D'HERBLAY THE INTEREST OF YOUR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WILL NEVER PAY MY FOUR MILLIONS FOR ME WHY NOT MONSEIGNEUR GOOD-NIGHT I HAVE BUSINESS TO TRANSACT WITH MY CLERKS BEFORE I RETIRE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST MONSEIGNEUR D'HERBLAY YOU WISH THINGS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE SHALL I HAVE MY FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS THIS EVENING YES GO TO SLEEP THEN IN PERFECT SAFETY--IT IS I WHO TELL YOU TO DO SO NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ASSURANCE AND THE TONE IN WHICH IT WAS GIVEN FOUQUET LEFT THE ROOM SHAKING HIS HEAD AND HEAVING A SIGH
BUT I DO NOT THINK THE KING KNOWS OF MY GROTTO YES SAID ARAMIS THEY ARE LOOKING ABOUT THEM BUT IT IS ONLY FOR A THICKER TREE ARAMIS WAS NOT MISTAKEN THE KING'S LOOKS WERE DIRECTED UPWARD AND NOT AROUND HIM
YOU WOULD HAVE ADVISED ME PERHAPS IN WHAT RESPECT YOU HAVE OFTEN DONE SO MOST CERTAINLY I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE SO IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE FOR I DO NOT FORGIVE AS YOU DO
A DEAD SILENCE ENSUED AMONG THE SPECTATORS
FOUQUET KISSED THE LETTER AND REWARDED THE BEARER WITH A HANDFUL OF GOLD
ARAMIS WAS NEITHER AN IMAGINATIVE NOR A SENSITIVE MAN
TAKE CARE THAT NO TALE WITH WHICH YOUR NAME MAY BE ASSOCIATED REACHES MY EAR MONSIEUR SAID DE WARDES IT IS USELESS THREATENING TO NO PURPOSE I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED M
THEN SHE CONTINUED I HAD REASONED MYSELF INTO THE BELIEF THAT HEAVEN CALLED ME INTO EXISTENCE WITH THAT OBJECT--I THE DAUGHTER OF A POWERFUL MONARCH
I ENTERED INTO NO DETAILS
SIRE REPLIED FOUQUET IF THAT BISHOP HAD BEEN EDUCATED EARLY IN LIFE NO PRELATE IN THE KINGDOM WOULD DESERVE THE HIGHEST DISTINCTIONS BETTER THAN HE HIS LEARNING IS NOT EXTENSIVE THEN HE CHANGED THE SWORD FOR THE CRUCIFIX AND THAT RATHER LATE IN LIFE
THERE WANT TWENTY SAID HE
IN HIS ADVANCED AGE AND THE AVARICE OF MAZARIN AT A PERIOD OF LIFE WHEN HE HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF GORGING HIMSELF WITH FRENCH GOLD
THE FIVE HUNDRED PISTOLES HERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM AND THE OTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WHEN I AM IN POSSESSION OF MY PLACE MANICAMP MADE A FACE
A MOVEMENT WHICH BROUGHT HIM CLOSER TO DE WARDES WHO WAS CONVERSING WITH THE CHEVALIER DE LORRAINE RESPECTING THE DEPARTURE OF BUCKINGHAM
BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW I FOUGHT IT OUT WITH HIM
GO AND DINE WITH HER OH
AS HE SAID THIS HE POINTED OUT TO THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HIM THE MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE WHICH THE SKY PRESENTED OF DEEPEST AZURE IN THE HORIZON THE AMPHITHEATRE OF FLEECY CLOUDS ASCENDING FROM THE SUN'S DISC TO THE ZENITH ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF A RANGE OF SNOWY MOUNTAINS WHOSE SUMMITS WERE HEAPED ONE UPON ANOTHER
A DEAD-WHITE FLASH OF LIGHTNING ILLUMINED THE FOREST WITH A WEIRD GLARE AND A PEAL OF THUNDER LIKE A DISCHARGE OF ARTILLERY BURST OVER THEIR HEADS AS IF THE HEIGHT OF THE OAK THAT SHELTERED THEM HAD ATTRACTED THE STORM
IS IT THE SAME FOR THOSE WHO ARE SENT HERE AGAINST THEIR WILLS AS FOR THOSE WHO COME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD A THOUSAND PARDONS MY LORD
RAOUL HAD GONE DIRECTLY TO MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE AND HAD SALUTED HER WITH THE PROFOUNDEST RESPECT AT WHICH LOUISE BLUSHED AND COULD NOT SAY A WORD
LET US SPEAK NO LONGER UPON THIS MATTER
BUT NO ONE WAS THERE WHO COULD ASSIST HIM NOT EVEN MALICORNE
NAY CONTINUED BRAGELONNE YOU DISTRESS ME
COMPOSE YOURSELF MY DEAR MALICORNE COMPOSE YOURSELF NO NO
SAY THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS A MERE JOKE
AH AH HE SAID NOTICING HIS SUBMISSIVE AIR YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH THE LANDLORD YES MONSEIGNEUR
YES YOU DO NOT PERCEIVE ONE THING
LET PEOPLE LAUGH A LITTLE AT THE KING IN THIS AFFAIR AND I DO NOT THINK HE WILL COMPLAIN OF IT OH MADAME YOU ARE INDEED AN ANGEL OF GOODNESS AND SENSE IT IS TO MY OWN ADVANTAGE IN WHAT WAY HOW CAN YOU ASK ME WHY IT IS TO MY ADVANTAGE TO SPARE MY MAIDS OF HONOR THE REMARKS ANNOYANCES PERHAPS EVEN CALUMNIES THAT MIGHT FOLLOW
HIS SOLE AMBITION WAS TO SPEND MONEY
BUT BUT WHAT WHY M
DE GUICHE TURNED SLIGHTLY PALE BUT ENDEAVORED TO PRESERVE HIS SEEMING CHEERFULNESS
IT WOULD INDEED BE STRANGE MARQUISE REPLIED FOUQUET CHEERFULLY IF A SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES WERE NOT TO HAVE A PALTRY FOUR MILLIONS IN HIS COFFERS YES YES I BELIEVE YOU EITHER HAVE OR WILL HAVE THEM WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY SAYING I SHALL HAVE THEM IT IS NOT VERY LONG SINCE YOU WERE REQUIRED TO FURNISH TWO MILLIONS ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMS ALMOST AN AGE
IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY SAINT-AIGNAN ADDED THE KING LIKE A MAN BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY THE BLOW REQUIRES MORE THAN HUMAN STRENGTH TO SUPPORT IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER AS THE KING THUS SPOKE ASSUMING AN AIR OF THE MOST ANGELIC PATIENCE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IN ATTENDANCE KNOCKED GENTLY AT THE DOOR
RAOUL THRUST HIS HAND ASIDE
DE SAINT-AIGNAN ALL HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT THE FAMOUS SECRET
DE WARDES TOTTERED HIS KNEES GAVE WAY BENEATH HIM AND LEAVING HIS SWORD STILL FIXED IN THE DUKE'S ARM HE FELL INTO THE WATER WHICH WAS SOON CRIMSONED WITH A MORE GENUINE REFLECTION THAN THAT WHICH IT HAD BORROWED FROM THE CLOUDS
IT ONLY SHOWED THAT HE WAS MORE OR LESS SKILLFUL IN THE USE OF THE WEAPON MONSIEUR EXCLAIMED DE WARDES
AND M
LOUISE CLOSE YOUR EARS SO AS NOT TO HEAR WHAT MAY BE SAID
OH SAID SHE
TAKE CARE MADAME IS LISTENING TO US RAOUL HAD THRUST HIS HAND UP TO THE WRIST INTO HIS JUSTAUCORPS IN GREAT AGITATION
I WISH FOR PERMISSION TO GO AWAY
QUICK THE SECRET THE SECRET SAID THE DYING MAN LEANING UPON HIS CONFESSOR
THE KING'S UNEASINESS
DE BRAGELONNE IF HE BEGGED ME TO GIVE IT TO HIM AND TO THE KING IF HE COMMANDED ME IN THAT CASE GIVE ME THE KEY MONSIEUR
MALICORNE ENTERED AS BRILLIANT AS A STAR AND WEARING A SUPERB SWORD AT HIS SIDE
MALICORNE NODDED AFFIRMATIVELY TO MANICAMP
HE NEVER COMMITS HIMSELF IN ANY WAY
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND WILL ALWAYS MEET WITH MEN WHO WILL MADLY LOVE YOU IN THAT CASE EXCLAIMED THE PRINCESS I WILL CREATE A SOLITUDE AROUND ME WHICH INDEED SEEMS TO BE WHAT IS WISHED AND WHAT IS BEING PREPARED FOR ME
THE COUNT WAS TOO HAPPY TO BEAR MALICE AGAINST THE HUSBAND
WHEN WILL THEY BE REQUIRED SIRE TAKE YOUR TIME,--I MEAN--NO NO
ARE YOU NOT OF MY OPINION PRINCE NOT ALTOGETHER SO MY DEAR CHEVALIER
DE WARDES BOWED
MALICORNE A PROVINCIAL FORTUNE MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS YOUR FATHER IS NOT IN THE SECRETS OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE FOR NOTHING AN ADVANTAGE WHICH IS CONFINED TO LENDING MONSEIGNEUR MONEY IN A WORD YOU ARE NOT THE MOST CUNNING YOUNG FELLOW IN THE PROVINCE FOR NOTHING YOU FLATTER ME WHO I YES YOU HOW SO SINCE I MAINTAIN THAT I HAVE NO CREDIT AND YOU MAINTAIN I HAVE WELL THEN,--MY COMMISSION WELL,--YOUR COMMISSION SHALL I HAVE IT OR SHALL I NOT YOU SHALL HAVE IT AY BUT WHEN WHEN YOU LIKE WHERE IS IT THEN IN MY POCKET HOW--IN YOUR POCKET YES AND WITH A SMILE MALICORNE DREW FROM HIS POCKET A LETTER UPON WHICH MADEMOISELLE SEIZED AS A PREY AND WHICH SHE READ EAGERLY
I FOR INSTANCE AM PROUD
AND I SAW PLAIN ENOUGH JUST NOW WHEN LA VALLIERE FELL INTO HIS ARMS LA VALLIERE FELL INTO THE KING'S ARMS OH
I WAS QUITE AWARE THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH SOME ONE ELSE THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE
A NOTE SEEMS TO BE MORE SPEEDY AND MORE URGENT THAN A DISPATCH
HE HIMSELF REMAINED STANDING BEFORE HER WITH HIS HEAD UNCOVERED
AS FOR THE COMTE DE GUICHE WHO HAD ABANDONED MONSIEUR AS SOON AS HE COULD APPROACH MADAME ALONE HE CONVERSED WITH GREAT ANIMATION WITH MADAME DE VALENTINOIS AND WITH MADEMOISELLE DE CREQUY AND DE CHATILLON
THE FERVENT ASPIRATIONS OF HIS NATURE COULD BE READ IN HIS EYES
LET THAT WORD BE YES AND I AM YOURS ENTIRELY ELISE
DE BRAGELONNE HAS BY THE KING'S ORDER SET OFF FOR LONDON AND HE CHARGED ME WITH HIS RESPECTS FOR YOU
DE SAINT-REMY AH YES
LA VALLIERE ALONE PRESERVED SILENCE AND QUIETLY SHOOK HER HEAD
A NOBLE RACE YES MURMURED THE KING WITHOUT HOWEVER DARING TO MANIFEST HIS EMOTION FOR IT HAD NO OTHER CAUSE THAN CONTACT WITH A NATURE INTRINSICALLY NOBLE
IN VAIN DID HE TRY IN ORDER TO FIX UPON HIMSELF ONE OF THOSE LOOKS WHICH WERE THROWN CARELESSLY AROUND OR BESTOWED ELSEWHERE TO PRODUCE IN THE ANIMAL HE RODE ITS GREATEST DISPLAY OF STRENGTH SPEED TEMPER AND ADDRESS
THIS WAS INDEED A PIECE OF GOOD LUCK
BESIDES THE KING'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH TWO OR THREE NEW IDEAS
THE SUN HAD HOWEVER RISEN THROUGH A BANK OF ORANGE CLOUDS TINGEING WITH ITS CHEERFUL RAYS THE CRESTS OF THE BLACK WAVES
I TAKE ANOTHER SERVICE,--THAT IS ALL IN THE BOURGEOISIE OR IN THE ROBE ASKED MADAME DE SAINT-REMY DISDAINFULLY
COME HERE MONSIEUR GRISART SAID THE FRANCISCAN TO THE DOCTOR
I AM CERTAIN MY LORD THAT HE WILL NOT REMAIN UNGRATEFUL FOR THAT MONEY WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT I REPEAT THAT I RETAIN THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS IT IS A STRANGE AFFAIR
THESE DOGS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TREMENDOUS APPETITES
SO DO NOT BE AFRAID HE WILL NOT BITE YOU A PRETEXT WAS GIVEN IN THE GALLERY BY THE DUKE'S REMARK WHICH WAS NOT PERHAPS VERY LAUGHABLE FOR EVERY ONE TO LAUGH EXCESSIVELY
STILL ENCOURAGED BY YOUR DESIRE I WILL DO MY BEST SAINT-AIGNAN EXTENDED HIS FOOT AND HAND AND THUS BEGAN:--"WHITE AS MILK SHE CASTS UPON THE BREEZE THE PERFUME OF HER FAIR HAIR TINGED WITH GOLDEN HUES AS ARE THE EARS OF CORN
YES MY DEAR COMTE I WAS CELEBRATING PHYLLIS'S PRAISES AND YOU HAVE ACQUIRED THE RIGHT TO DO SO I YOU
THE DAY THAT ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD SELECTED FOR THE LOTTERY WAS A DECISIVE MOMENT
I ALREADY KNEW MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE'S SECRET AND THAT OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT PEOPLE ARE AMUSED WHEREVER YOUTH AND BEAUTY ARE TO BE FOUND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE HENRIETTA INQUIRED THE KING
THE FRANCISCAN EXTENDING HIS ARM BURNT BY THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE THE PAPER WHICH ARAMIS HAD HANDED HIM
SIX LEAGUES ON THE CONTRARY IS A GREAT DISTANCE IF IT BE SIX LEAGUES ON LAND
YOU IN THIS WRETCHED ROOM
SO NOW GO AWAY OH NO SAID MALICORNE
THAT IS THE VERY THING I ASK
BECAUSE TO GAIN HER CONSENT WAS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
YOU STAND IN NEED OF ME AURE AND I OF YOU
HIS MAJESTY IS SO SENSITIVE SO TENDER-HEARTED
SO MAKE YOURSELVES PERFECTLY EASY AND DO NOT BE AFRAID OF LEAVING ME HERE
IN WHOSE HANDWRITING IS IT MY OWN HAVE YOU ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY TO ME I THINK I HAVE SAID A GOOD DEAL MY LORD REPLIED THE CARDINAL
EVERY ONE HAD PARTAKEN OF THE BANQUET AT THE CHATEAU AND AFTERWARDS ASSUMED THEIR FULL COURT DRESSES
YOU WERE IN THE WRONG THIS MORNING WELL PERHAPS I WAS THERE IS NO PERHAPS AT ALL FOR IT IS A FACT YOU WERE SO CHEVALIER CHEVALIER YOUR ADVICE IS NOT GOOD NAY MY ADVICE IS GOOD
IF SHE DID BEAR YOU A LITTLE ILL-WILL POOR GIRL SHE COULD NOT BE MUCH BLAMED AND WHY SHOULD SHE BEAR ME ILL-WILL GOOD GRACIOUS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT SHE IS OF AS GOOD A FAMILY AND AS PRETTY AS YOU MOTHER
DE BRAGELONNE RAOUL BECAME AS PALE AS DEATH
NOT AT ALL REFLECT A LITTLE AH
HE RETURNED TO THE KING SAYING SIRE IT IS M
MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM TO WHICH SHE HAD RETIRED WAS LOOKING WITH NO SLIGHT CONFIDENCE AT THE DIFFERENT PERSONS PRESENT
A FEW FLEECY CLOUDS WERE FLOATING IN THE HEAVENS AND INDICATED FROM THEIR APPEARANCE A CONTINUANCE OF BEAUTIFUL WEATHER TEMPERED BY A GENTLE BREEZE FROM THE EAST
MONSIEUR DE SAINT-AIGNAN YOU ARE A PERFECT STREAM OF PASTORAL POESY SAID MADAME WITH AN AMIABLE SMILE WHICH SOMEWHAT COMFORTED THE NARRATOR
COMPOSED YET FULL OF ENERGY SHE INHALED THE AIR IN DEEP DRAUGHTS UNDER A LACE PARASOL WHICH WAS BORNE BY ONE OF HER PAGES
HAVE THE GOODNESS MY LORD FROM THIS MOMENT SAID HE NOT TO INTERPOSE BETWEEN HER ROYAL HIGHNESS AND MYSELF
TRY BY TOUCH AND SOUND AND CONSIDER AND PRONOUNCE YOUR SENTENCE THE LANDLORD REPLIED THE DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAD THE HONOR OF ATTENDING AN AFFILIATED BROTHER YES REPLIED THE FRANCISCAN IT IS SO
FOR A VERY LONG TIME RESUMED D'ARTAGNAN I HAVE SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONVERSING WITH YOU
HOWEVER HE VERY SOON LEFT OFF BUT HIS ANGER HAD INCREASED
OF THE TWO GUARDIANS OF THE TENT ONLY ONE WAS THERE
THE WEATHER HAD CLEARED UP A LITTLE BUT A KIND OF VEIL OF DUST LIKE A THICK GAUZE WAS STILL SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE HEAVENS AND THE SUN MADE EVERY ATOM GLISTEN WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF ITS RAYS
ONLY AS YOU NOW UNDERSTAND THE MATTER IN HAND YOU WILL REMAIN NEAR ME FOR I BEGIN TO FEEL FAINT SHALL I SUMMON THE PHYSICIAN NOT YET NOT YET
IT IS POSSIBLE THEN THAT MADAME CAN HAVE GIVEN YOU GROUNDS FOR THESE COMPLAINTS AGAINST HER PRECISELY SO WHAT YOUR WIFE MARRIED ONLY FOUR DAYS AGO PREFERS SOME OTHER PERSON TO YOURSELF
BUT THIS TIME IT WAS DE GUICHE'S TURN TO GIVE THE DUKE A LESSON
BUT MADAME WAS ENDOWED WITH A SPIRIT OF RESISTANCE--A GIFT FREQUENTLY FATAL TO ITS POSSESSOR FOR IT BREAKS WHERE ANOTHER DISPOSITION WOULD HAVE BENT
HE WHOM WE HAVE INTRODUCED AS THE KING'S FRIEND WAS INDEED AN UNCOMMON PERSONAGE
IN THE MONTHS OF MARCH-JULY IN 1844 IN THE MAGAZINE LE SIECLE THE FIRST PORTION OF A STORY APPEARED PENNED BY THE CELEBRATED PLAYWRIGHT ALEXANDRE DUMAS
COLBERT FORMERLY MAZARIN'S TRUSTED CLERK
BUT I MUST GET THROUGH AS WELL AS I CAN
SHE IS ALWAYS LEAVING ME FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER
WHAT I THINK I DO NOT ALWAYS SAY BUT IN THAT CASE I SAY NOTHING
WHY INDEED SHOULD HE LEAVE
THE OTHERS TURNED ASIDE TO THE RIGHT AND CONTINUED ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS THE LARGE PARK
AN AUDIENCE SIRE HE REPLIED FOR THE COMTE DE LA FERE WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED FROM BLOIS AND IS MOST ANXIOUS TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH YOUR MAJESTY I HAVE AN HOUR TO SPARE BETWEEN CARDS AND SUPPER SAID THE KING
BUT HE RECKONED UPON THE ELOQUENCE OF HIS GESTURES
ARAMIS FELT THAT THE AIR OF THE ROOM WAS STIFLING
TOWARDS HER I WILL DIRECT THE GLANCE I DARE NOT BESTOW UPON YOU AND WHICH OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ROUSE YOU FROM YOUR INDIFFERENCE
LET US SET OFF IMMEDIATELY THE KING THREW HIS CLOAK OVER SAINT-AIGNAN'S SHOULDERS ASKED HIM FOR HIS AND BOTH WENT OUT INTO THE VESTIBULE
BUT YOUR SET MADAME COMES NEXT WHAT ARE THEY WORTH MOUNTED NO
YOU HAVE WON IT MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN OPENED THE PAPER EAGERLY AND SCANNED IT TWICE
I HAVE BEEN WANDERING ABOUT FONTAINEBLEAU LOOKING FOR THREE THINGS I CANNOT FIND
THE UPHOLSTERERS HAD LAID DOWN THE CARPETS ERECTED THE SEATS
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO HAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO SAID THE QUEEN LAYING DOWN HER PEN
WELL RESUMED MADAME WHAT WERE THOSE SHEPHERDESSES SAYING TO EACH OTHER SAINT-AIGNAN HOWEVER WHOSE VANITY HAD BEEN WOUNDED DID NOT FEEL HIMSELF IN A POSITION TO SUSTAIN AN ATTACK OF NEW AND REFRESHED TROOPS AND MERELY SAID MADAME THE SHEPHERDESSES WERE CONFIDING TO ONE ANOTHER THEIR LITTLE PREFERENCES NAY NAY
A BREVET LIKE THIS SAID MONTALAIS
CHAPTER XLI
I THOUGHT YOU GENERALLY PUT OUT MONEY AT BETTER INTEREST THAN THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN YOU WILL ADMIT YOUR MISTAKE MY DEAR D'HERBLAY THE VERY DAY ON WHICH A MAN ENTERS THE BASTILE HE IS NO LONGER PROTECTED BY HIS PAST YES HE IS IF THE BONDS ARE PERFECTLY REGULAR
ALL MY PEOPLE ARE AT DAGGERS DRAWN WITH THAT FELLOW I SAW HIM I TELL YOU AND HIS FACE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN TO ME WHEN HE ENTERED JUST NOW STRUCK ME AS DISAGREEABLY FAMILIAR WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SOMETHING THEN WHILE HE WAS HERE BECAUSE IT IS ONLY AT THIS VERY MINUTE THAT MY MEMORY IS CLEAR UPON THE SUBJECT REALLY SAID FOUQUET YOU ALARM ME AND HE AGAIN RANG THE BELL
D'ARTAGNAN WHERE HE IS TO BE FOUND DE WARDES TURNED PALE
IF YOU BELIEVE ME TO BE MARBLE AS YOU ARE UNDECEIVE YOURSELF I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SIRE VERY WELL SAID THE KING CASTING DOWN HIS EYES
I AM HOWEVER PAINFULLY AFFECTED BY IT
COVERS THE YEAR 1661
CHAPTER XXXIX
BUT ONCE RECOVERED SHE BEGAN TO REFLECT UPON THE EVENTS SO HEARTLESSLY ANNOUNCED TO HER
WILL YOU OBLIGE ME BY EXPLAINING THERE IS NO DOUBT IT WAS NECESSARY THAT BUCKINGHAM THE FATHER SHOULD COME TO PARIS IN ORDER THAT HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT HIS WIFE WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN OF THE FRENCH COURT
AND HE IS HERE YES SIRE
MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE LIKE MONTALAIS WAS ON MADAME'S LEFT HAND AND THE LAST BUT ONE ON THE LINE MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE BEING ON HER RIGHT
THAT IS A GOOD ROUND SUM COLBERT TURNED PALE
AND NO DISTURBANCES NO COMPLAINTS AND MONEY ENOUGH SAID FOUQUET
I HAVE KNOWN HIM EVER SINCE HE WAS BORN THAT IS ALL DO YOU AFFIRM THAT SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN YOUR MAJESTY QUESTIONS ME WITH A MISTRUST IN WHICH I RECOGNIZE ANOTHER CHARACTER THAN YOUR OWN
DURING THOSE THREE YEARS YOU HAVE REMAINED CONSTANTLY AND UNCHANGEABLY CRUEL
YES M
IT IS BUT FITTING THAT I SHOULD BE THE MEDIATOR
AND TAKING MEASURES TO MAKE HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE HE LEANED HIS BACK AGAINST A TREE AND LISTENED AND HEARD THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION
AND AS DRYADS ARE MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES OF GREAT BEAUTY THEY INHABIT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TREES IN OTHER WORDS THE LARGEST TO BE FOUND AT THIS EXORDIUM WHICH RECALLED UNDER A TRANSPARENT VEIL THE CELEBRATED STORY OF THE ROYAL OAK WHICH HAD PLAYED SO IMPORTANT A PART IN THE LAST EVENING SO MANY HEARTS BEGAN TO BEAT BOTH FROM JOY AND UNEASINESS THAT IF SAINT-AIGNAN HAD NOT HAD A GOOD AND SONOROUS VOICE THEIR THROBBINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD ABOVE THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE
IT IS PROBABLE THAT BEFORE LONG WAR MAY BE DECLARED
ABSOLUTELY ALL MADEMOISELLE REPLIED MALICORNE
AN UNKNOWN UNHEARD OF ANGUISH GLIDED THROUGH HIS VEINS AND LAID SIEGE TO HIS HEART
ENGLISH AND FRENCH RIVALED EACH OTHER IN THEIR DEVOTION AND COURTEOUS ATTENTION TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS TRAVELERS
MONSIEUR'S BROWS CONTRACTED AS HE REMARKED ALOUD WHAT A CHEERLESS HOUSE
YES MONSIEUR BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY YET YOU QUITTED YOUR GUARD ONLY FROM THE FIRST EFFECT OF THE COLD STEEL BUT I HAVE RECOVERED
THE LAIRD'S NAME WAS MACCUMNOR AN AUSTRIAN FROM VIENNA WITHOUT TITLE OR COAT OF ARMS WHO HAD ARRIVED IN A CARRIAGE
LOUISE CONTINUED MONTALAIS THE KING HAS DEIGNED TO EXPRESS HIS UNEASINESS ON YOUR ACCOUNT THE KING EXCLAIMED LOUISE STARTING UP ABRUPTLY AS IF A STREAM OF FIRE HAD STARTED THROUGH HER FRAME TO HER HEART
THE KING ADVANCED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP WHICH HAD NOW BECOME A GENERAL ONE BY A MOVEMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE FROM THE CIRCUMFERENCE TO THE CENTER
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED I SHALL CALL IT A TERRIBLE ATTACK
HE ROSE IMMEDIATELY AND LEFT THE APARTMENT
THROW THE BLAME RATHER ON YOUR OWN IMPATIENCE THAN ON THE KING'S GOOD FEELINGS TOWARDS YOU RAOUL IN UTTER CONSTERNATION ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE COUNT'S FRANKNESS AS WELL AS HIS DIPLOMACY REMAINED PLUNGED IN DULL AND GLOOMY STUPOR
THIS PERFECT REPOSE OF MANNER DISCONCERTED RAOUL EXTREMELY
A FEW MINUTES ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL WHICH WILL ENABLE YOU TO GIVE ME THE INFORMATION I AM ABOUT TO HAVE THE HONOR TO ASK YOU FOR HOW SERIOUS YOU ARE M
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT POOR YOUNG FELLOW COULD BE AN ASSASSIN THE VERY THING I WAS SAYING
WITH MONTALAIS WHAT IS HIS NAME MALICORNE AND YOU CAN DEPEND ON HIM I BELIEVE SO SIRE
THANK YOU THIS IS A STRANGE AFFAIR MURMURED D'ARTAGNAN AS HE SLOWLY ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE AFTER HE HAD LEFT BAISEMEAUX
I WISHED TO LEAVE THE CARDINAL'S SERVICE
WHO NOW BIT HIS LIP
I WILL EVEN SAY AT THIS MOMENT I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU HATE ME OH YOU HAVE NEVER SPOKEN SO TRULY WELL ON MY PART I DETEST YOU AH
THE ORDER ISSUED BY THE KING WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF FONTAINEBLEAU
YOU MUST HAVE ONE YES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IS IT NOT M
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO PROMISE A TRANQUIL FUTURE
SOMETHING THAT NEITHER NAIAD NOR DRYAD FORESAW
COURAGE MY MEN SAID DE GUICHE
PORTHOS IS VERY FOND OF DISPLAY
WELL WELL SAID D'ARTAGNAN I WILL ADD UP YOUR ACCOUNTS FOR YOU
YOU ARE JOKING MONSEIGNEUR THE TIME MAY COME WHEN THE GOVERNOR OF THE BASTILE MAY PROVE A VERY EXCELLENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE NOT THE GOOD FORTUNE TO UNDERSTAND YOU D'HERBLAY MONSEIGNEUR WE HAD OUR OWN POETS OUR OWN ENGINEER OUR OWN ARCHITECT OUR OWN MUSICIANS OUR OWN PRINTER AND OUR OWN PAINTERS
MONTESPAN WERE HERE SAID MONTALAIS
DO SO SAID FOUQUET
FOR IF SUCH A THING WERE TO HAPPEN TO EITHER OF US IT WOULD BE MOST ESSENTIAL TO BE ASSURED OF ITS TRUTH
YOU SURELY DO NOT WISH ME TO JOIN YOU IN THE TREE NO
FOUQUET THERE INQUIRED D'ARTAGNAN
IN THE MEANTIME THE PROCESSION OF THE PRINCESS ARRIVED AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR BRAGELONNE TWO ARMIES WOULD HAVE BEEN ENGAGED TOGETHER IN CONFLICT AND BLOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN SHED UPON THE FLOWERS WITH WHICH THE GROUND WAS COVERED
YOU MUST HAVE REMARKED THE CHANGE WHICH A FEW YEARS HAVE ALREADY MADE IN HER
AND I REMEMBER NOW THAT I SAW HER AS I PASSED THROUGH BLOIS
YOU KNOW LOUISE THAT FROM MY CHILDHOOD I HAVE REGARDED YOU AS MY SISTER AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN THE CONFIDANTE OF ALL MY TROUBLES TO WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED ALL MY HOPES YES M
ECCE HOMO HE EXCLAIMED
HIS GRACE WAS PRECEDED BY A COURIER WHO ARRIVED HERE THREE DAYS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY RETAINED ALL THE HOUSES FIT FOR HABITATION THE TOWN POSSESSES COME COME MANICAMP LET US UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WELL WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU IS CLEAR ENOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME BUT SURELY BUCKINGHAM DOES NOT OCCUPY THE WHOLE OF LE HAVRE HE CERTAINLY DOES NOT OCCUPY IT SINCE HE HAS NOT YET ARRIVED
WHILE MONTALAIS WAS ENGAGED IN LOOKING AFTER THE COMTE AND MANICAMP MALICORNE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE YOUNG GIRL'S ATTENTION BEING DRAWN AWAY TO RENDER HIS POSITION SOMEWHAT MORE TOLERABLE AND WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND SHE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE CHANGE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE
A TOLERABLY HANDSOME VESTIBULE AND A STAIRCASE OF WHITE STONE LED TO THE GOVERNOR'S APARTMENTS WHO CROSSED THE ANTE-CHAMBER THE DINING-ROOM WHERE BREAKFAST WAS BEING PREPARED OPENED A SMALL SIDE DOOR AND CLOSETED HIMSELF WITH HIS GUEST IN A LARGE CABINET THE WINDOWS OF WHICH OPENED OBLIQUELY UPON THE COURTYARD AND THE STABLES
THIS MOVEMENT INDUCED MADAME TO LOOK TOWARDS THE DOOR AND AT THAT MOMENT THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS ANNOUNCED THE KING
DE GUICHE I CANNOT GIVE YOU EITHER GOOD OR BAD NEWS FOR I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
NOW FOR THE MONEY SIDE OF THE QUESTION FIFTEEN TO TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS DOWRY AT THE VERY OUTSET SIRE
THE FRIEND HAD LITTLE OR NO FRIENDSHIP BUT HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE COMTE DE GUICHE HIMSELF THE FRIEND OF MONSIEUR THE KING'S BROTHER
YOU ARE DESIRED TO SET OFF IN SUCH HASTE SAID MONTALAIS ALMOST PARALYZED BY THIS UNFORESEEN EVENT
I BEG YOUR LORDSHIP TO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PRECEDE US ASHORE AND TO GIVE DIRECTIONS THAT EVERYTHING BE IN PROPER ORDER ON OUR ARRIVAL THIS WAS A FRESH DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE DUKE AND STILL MORE SO SINCE IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED
YOU MUST SEE LA VALLIERE AND WITHOUT THINKING ANY MORE OF BECOMING HER LOVER WHICH IS OUT OF THE QUESTION MUST DECLARE YOURSELF HER MOST DEVOTED FRIEND AND HER MOST HUMBLE SERVANT I WILL DO SO REPLIED FOUQUET AND WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST FEELING OF DISINCLINATION FOR SHE SEEMS A GOOD-HEARTED GIRL OR A VERY CLEVER ONE SAID ARAMIS
IMPULSIVELY GOOD INDIFFERENTLY DISPOSED AT BOTTOM
AS FOR BUCKINGHAM WHO WAS DRESSED VERY SIMPLY IN A GRAY SATIN VEST AND DOUBLET OF VIOLET-COLORED VELVET WEARING HIS HAT THRUST OVER HIS EYES AND WITHOUT ORDERS OR EMBROIDERY HE WAS TAKEN NO MORE NOTICE OF THAN DE WARDES WHO WAS IN BLACK LIKE AN ATTORNEY
AND SO THE OLDER LADIES OF THE COURT THE STRONG-MINDED WOMEN OF THE REGENCY OR OF THE LAST REIGN POUTED AND SULKED AT THEIR EASE
BUT AS I DO NOT APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT WITH MADAME I WISH HIM NEITHER HARM NOR GOOD THE CHEVALIER HAD ASSUMED A BITTERNESS WITH REGARD TO DE GUICHE AS HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO DO WITH REGARD TO THE KING
THE KING BELIEVES YOU AND FORGIVES YOU
I IMPLORE YOU THEREFORE TO LOVE ME NO MORE AND TO FORGET UTTERLY THAT I HAVE EVER ADDRESSED A WORD OR A GLANCE TOWARDS YOU DE GUICHE TURNED AROUND BENDING A LOOK FULL OF PASSIONATE DEVOTION UPON HER
BUT THIS IS THE VERY THING THAT AMAZES ME SO MUCH
THERE IS NO MAN LIVING BESIDES LOUIS XIV
DEAR MONTALAIS SAID LOUISE HOW SEVERE YOUR TONE IS YOU DESERVE NO INDULGENCE,--I AM NEITHER MORE NOR LESS SEVERE THAN USUAL
AT THE APPEARANCE HOWEVER OF THE BANNERS BORNE AT THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION COMPLETE ORDER WAS RESTORED
THE QUEEN-MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION
IN MY FAMILY ADDED BUCKINGHAM YOU ARE AWARE M
I REPEAT THAT YOU DO NOT PREFER YOUR REQUEST AS THOUGH YOU WISHED IT SUCCESS WELL SIRE THAT IS TRUE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU THEN
LET US NOT SPEAK OF THEM HOWEVER
LOUISE TOO WELL DO I KNOW WHY
RAOUL INDIGNANT TURNED ROUND FROWNINGLY FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS LIP CURLING WITH DISDAIN
FOR WHILE WITH SOME PERSONS I PLACE MY FRIENDSHIP AT THE DISPOSAL OF MY UNDERSTANDING WITH OTHERS I CALL MY DISTRUST TO MY AID BY WHICH MY DISCERNMENT IS INCREASED
FOR A MAN SO PURITANICALLY CONSCIENTIOUS AS YOU ARE WHO CAN REPROACH AN OLD SOLDIER FOR A YOUTHFUL FREAK FIVE-AND-THIRTY YEARS AFTER IT HAPPENED WILL ALLOW ME TO ASK WHETHER YOU WHO ADVOCATE SUCH EXCESSIVE PURITY OF CONSCIENCE WILL UNDERTAKE ON YOUR SIDE TO DO NOTHING CONTRARY EITHER TO CONSCIENCE OR THE PRINCIPLE OF HONOR
NEVER HAD ANY VOICE SO GRATIFIED HIS EAR
BUT SURELY THAT WILL PREJUDICIALLY AFFECT THE RUMOR YOU WERE GOING TO SPREAD SIRE WHAT RUMOR THAT YOUR ATTENTION WAS TAKEN UP BY HER OH SAID THE KING CARELESSLY I TRUST IT WILL BE REPORTED ALL THE SAME MADAME STILL WAITED
BUT PURSUED COLBERT IT WOULD BE ONLY A PROPER DISPLAY OF YOUR MAGNIFICENCE MONSEIGNEUR IF YOU WERE TO OFFER TO HIS MAJESTY A FETE IN YOUR WONDERFUL GARDENS--IN THOSE GARDENS WHICH HAVE COST YOU SIXTY MILLIONS OF FRANCS SEVENTY-TWO SAID FOUQUET
SHE IS CLEAR-SIGHTED AND WILL UNDERSTAND YES BUT IF SHE SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD AND UNDERSTOOD TOO WELL SHE MAY TALK YOU DO NOT KNOW LOUISE COUNT SAID RAOUL
FOUQUET WHO HAS RECEIVED FROM ME LETTERS FOR THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN
WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE RENOUNCED ALL THOUGHT OF ME FOREVER FROM NECESSITY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND NEXT BECAUSE YOU WILL YIELD TO MY ENTREATY THEN YOU WILL JUDGE ME MORE FAVORABLY AND I AM CONVINCED YOU WILL REPLACE THIS LOVE--FORGIVE THE FRIVOLITY OF THE EXPRESSION--BY A SINCERE FRIENDSHIP WHICH YOU WILL BE READY TO OFFER ME AND WHICH I PROMISE YOU SHALL BE CORDIALLY ACCEPTED DE GUICHE HIS FOREHEAD BEDEWED WITH PERSPIRATION A FEELING OF DEATH IN HIS HEART AND A TREMBLING AGITATION THROUGH HIS WHOLE FRAME BIT HIS LIP STAMPED HIS FOOT ON THE GROUND AND IN A WORD DEVOURED THE BITTERNESS OF HIS GRIEF
AND IN SUCH WAYS DID THEY PASS AWAY THE PLEASANT TIME
FOR THE STORY NOT ONLY APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE ALL THE INTEREST OF A NATIONAL INCIDENT BUT STILL MORE SEEMS TO BE A CIRCUMSTANCE OF VERY RECENT OCCURRENCE I OUGHT TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING SAID THE COMTE
FOR DID I NOT KNOW THAT YOUR MAJESTY WAS THE MOST GENEROUS MAN IN YOUR KINGDOM I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU WERE JESTING YOU DO NOT I KNOW FEAR SUCH A THING
I THINK THE PRINCESS RATHER GIDDY WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE PHILIP
WHEN A WHOLE HOUR IS OCCUPIED IN ANALYZING THE MERITS AND THE PERFUME OF A SACHET OR A FLOWER;--THERE ARE WORDS IN THIS STYLE OF CONVERSATION WHICH EVERY ONE MIGHT LISTEN TO BUT THERE ARE GESTURES AND SIGHS THAT EVERY ONE CANNOT PERCEIVE
IT IS VERY AGREEABLE TO PAY YOU A VISIT HERE BUT OUTSIDE THE DOOR MONTALAIS MADE A VERY LOW OBEISANCE
IN THAT CASE MADAME WILL CHOOSE THE FIRST ONE WHO APPROACHES IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM THE OBJECT OF HER PREFERENCE AND TO BRING BACK HER HUSBAND BY JEALOUSY DEEP
BUT AS HE DID NOT SEEM THE LEAST DEGREE IN THE WORLD DISPOSED TO OFFER THEM TO MADAME SHE FELT ALMOST SATISFIED OR NEARLY SO
YOU MAY POSSIBLY FIND IN THIS LETTER WHAT YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO LEARN RAOUL HURRIEDLY BROKE THE SEAL
IF YOU SHOW YOURSELF TO OTHERS IN YOUR PRESENT STATE PEOPLE WILL TAKE YOU FOR A VERY UNHAPPY HUSBAND THE FACT IS REPLIED PHILIP I AM NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED AS A HUSBAND AND I SHALL NOT BE SORRY IF OTHERS KNOW IT FOR SHAME PHILIP WELL THEN MADAME I WILL TELL YOU FRANKLY THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE LIFE I AM REQUIRED TO LEAD EXPLAIN YOURSELF MY WIFE DOES NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO ME
TO THIS THE KING REPLIED IN A QUICK TONE OF VOICE WHICH SHOWED THE INTEREST HE TOOK IN HIS SISTER-IN-LAW THANK HEAVEN MADAME IS ABOVE CENSURE THE CENSURE OF OTHERS CERTAINLY I ADMIT SAID MONSIEUR
ALWAYS HERE AH MADAME REPLIED MALICORNE IN A RESPECTFUL TONE
LOUIS MELANCHOLY AND DIFFIDENT
LISTENING TO ANNE OF AUSTRIA IN ORDER TO PERMIT HER TO DISCLOSE HER OWN THOUGHTS TESTIFYING HIS APPROVAL ONLY BY LOOK AND GESTURE HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM CERTAIN PIERCING GLANCES AND FROM CERTAIN SKILLFUL INSINUATIONS THAT THE QUEEN SO CLEAR-SIGHTED IN MATTERS OF GALLANTRY HAD IF NOT GUESSED AT LEAST SUSPECTED HIS WEAKNESS FOR MADAME
AND SEE THEY ARE BENDING THEIR STEPS THIS WAY VERY WELL
THE KING ON RETIRING TO HIS APARTMENTS TO GIVE SOME DIRECTIONS AND TO ARRANGE HIS IDEAS FOUND ON HIS TOILETTE-GLASS A SMALL NOTE THE HANDWRITING OF WHICH SEEMED DISGUISED
I HAVE NO REASON CERTAINLY TO FLATTER MYSELF ABOUT THE RECEPTION I MEET WITH HERE AT ANY TIME
WE SHOULD BE SEEN DO YOU REALLY THINK SO SAID MANICAMP IN AN INSINUATING VOICE
BUT YOU GIVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF BEING UNACQUAINTED WITH THE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING I NOT ACQUAINTED WITH M
YOU TAKE THAT PAPER WELL AND YOU SET OUT INSTEAD OF ME AH YOU PUT YOUR HORSES TO THEIR BEST SPEED GOOD IN SIX HOURS YOU WILL BE AT ETAMPES
WHY WILL NOT THE MARECHAL ADVANCE ME A PORTION OF MY PATRIMONY BECAUSE YOU WOULD THROW IT AWAY SAID RAOUL
AND BESIDES
THERE WILL BE NO OCCASION FOR HIM TO COME TO MEET YOU AS HE WILL SEE YOU AS HE PASSES BY ARAMIS BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS ASSENT
HEALTH JOY HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY TO YOUR HIGHNESS WELCOME DE GUICHE COME ON MY RIGHT SIDE BUT KEEP YOUR HORSE IN HAND FOR I WISH TO RETURN AT A WALKING PACE UNDER THE COOL SHADE OF THESE TREES AS YOU PLEASE MONSEIGNEUR SAID DE GUICHE TAKING HIS PLACE ON THE PRINCE'S RIGHT AS HE HAD BEEN INVITED TO DO
TO SEE SUCH BEAUTIFUL BRACELETS ON ANY ONE'S ARMS BUT YOURS OR MINE IS WHAT I CANNOT RECONCILE MYSELF TO WELL WELL SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA CONCEALING BY A SMILE A VIOLENT PANG SHE HAD JUST EXPERIENCED DO NOT LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WORST LIGHT IMMEDIATELY AH MADAME FORTUNE IS BLIND AND I AM TOLD THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED TICKETS QUITE AS MANY AS THAT
I WAS ABOUT SETTING OFF FOR PARIS--YOU WERE AWAY
THE ONE WHICH HAD THE PRINCESS ON BOARD AND CARRIED THE ADMIRAL'S FLAG PRECEDED THE OTHERS
BUT THEN IF INSTEAD OF ASKING HIM FOR MONEY YOU WERE TO ASK WHAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT WHAT DO YOU CALL IMPORTANT WELL
YOU TELL ME NOTHING
HE ROSE AND SAID IT IS NO MATTER
MADAME WILL BE AS MUCH VANQUISHED BY THE MAN AS BY THE ACTION
HE CONCENTRATES ALL HIS STRENGTH ON THE SIDE WHERE HIS STRENGTH WILL DO NO INJURY TO ANYTHING OR ANY ONE
SPARE NO PAINS IN YOUR PERSON DE GUICHE AND LOOK YOUR VERY BEST
DE MALICORNE EXCLAIMED THE COMTE
FOUQUET--THE DEUCE ARE YOU NOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM IT IS RATHER HE WHO MAY NOT BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ME
HE AS WELL AS EVERY ONE ELSE
THE PREY IN QUESTION HAD FALLEN INTO THE NET OF MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WHO DISPLAYED IT WITH SOME PRIDE TO HER LESS SUCCESSFUL RIVALS
DE MONTESPAN IT IS TRUE BUT SHE WOULD BE IN DESPAIR IF M
HE ENDEAVORED THEREFORE APPARENTLY TO RECALL IT WHILE IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO DO SO
A DEARER FRIEND WHO IS ONLY A--SISTER MADAME WAS SILENT AND CAST DOWN HER EYES
WITH A COUPLE BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH COST ME FIVE SOUS I MAKE HIM TIPSY EVERY SUNDAY
EVERYBODY HERE IS PLEASURE-HUNTING YES INDEED THAT IS THE VERY THING THAT MAKES THOSE DULL WHO DO NOT CARE FOR PLEASURE IN WHAT A TONE YOU SAY THAT PHILIP UPON MY WORD MADAME I SPEAK AS I THINK EXPLAIN YOURSELF
BUT ON THE DOWNWARD PATH OF THOSE PASSIONS IN WHICH THE HEART REJOICES TOWARDS WHICH YOUTH IMPELS US NO ONE CAN DECIDE WHERE TO STOP NOT EVEN THE MAN WHO HAS IN ADVANCE CALCULATED ALL THE CHANCES OF HIS OWN SUCCESS OR ANOTHER'S SUBMISSION
WHEN HOWEVER THE QUEENS EXPRESSED THEIR SATISFACTION AND THE SPECTATORS THEIR ENTHUSIASM WHEN THE KING HAD RETIRED TO HIS DRESSING-ROOM TO CHANGE HIS COSTUME AND WHILST MONSIEUR DRESSED AS A WOMAN AS HE DELIGHTED TO BE WAS IN HIS TURN DANCING ABOUT DE GUICHE WHO HAD NOW RECOVERED HIMSELF APPROACHED MADAME WHO SEATED AT THE BACK OF THE THEATER WAS WAITING FOR THE SECOND PART AND HAD QUITTED THE OTHERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING A SORT OF SOLITUDE FOR HERSELF IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD TO MEDITATE AS IT WERE BEFOREHAND UPON CHOROGRAPHIC EFFECTS
FIRST WE HAVE M
DOES ANY SECRET REPUGNANCE OR ANY HEREDITARY DISLIKE EXIST BETWEEN YOU AND HER FAMILY LOOK RAOUL AT THAT BEAUTIFUL LILY OF THE VALLEY SAID ATHOS
FOR INSTANCE FOR A PRINCE OF THE BLOOD I HAVE FIFTY FRANCS A DAY ONLY YOU HAVE NO PRINCE OF THE BLOOD
THE LADIES OF HONOR UNITED IN A BODY IN ORDER TO RESIST WITH GREATER EFFECT AND CONSEQUENTLY WITH MORE SUCCESS THE WITTY AND LIVELY CONVERSATIONS WHICH THE YOUNG MEN HELD ABOUT THEM WERE ENABLED LIKE A BATTALION FORMED IN A SQUARE TO OFFER EACH OTHER THE MEANS OF ATTACK AND DEFENSE WHICH WERE THUS AT THEIR COMMAND
IT IS HE WHO WILL DO THE HONORS OF FRANCE AS YOU HAVE DONE THOSE OF ENGLAND
BUT HOW COULD YOUR MAJESTY HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF IT BY A PUBLIC RUMOR MONSIEUR FOUQUET WHICH SAYS SUCH WONDERFUL THINGS OF YOURSELF AND THE MARVELS OF YOUR HOUSE
ARAMIS JUST SO
GREATLY SIRE
YOU PRUDENT
YOU ARE THE BARON DE WOSTPUR YES MONSEIGNEUR AND THIS LETTER IS FROM YOU YES MONSEIGNEUR THE GENERAL OF THE JESUITS DREW A PAPER FROM HIS BUNDLE AND PRESENTED IT TO THE BARON WHO GLANCED AT IT AND MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SAYING YES MONSEIGNEUR THIS LETTER IS MINE CAN YOU SHOW ME THE REPLY WHICH THE SECRETARY OF THE GRAND COUNCIL RETURNED TO YOU HERE IT IS SAID THE BARON HOLDING TOWARDS THE FRANCISCAN A LETTER BEARING SIMPLY THE ADDRESS TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE BARON DE WOSTPUR AND CONTAINING ONLY THIS PHRASE FROM THE 15TH TO THE 22ND MAY FONTAINEBLEAU THE HOTEL OF THE BEAU PAON.--A
DE GUICHE WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING AMONG THE DIFFERENT BOATS FOR ONE STRONGER THAN THE OTHERS WHICH MIGHT OFFER A CHANCE OF REACHING THE ENGLISH VESSELS PERCEIVING THE PILOT-BOAT GETTING READY TO START SAID TO RAOUL
ACKNOWLEDGING THIS TOUCHING SELF-DENIAL BY THE FIXITY OF HIS ATTENTION THE KING SHOWED LA VALLIERE HOW MUCH HE APPRECIATED ITS DELICACY
LORD I AM NOT WORTHY END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S TEN YEARS LATER BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS PERE
AND WHENEVER IT MAY CHANCE TO HAPPEN THAT THE TEMPTER SUGGESTS ONE OF THOSE VILE THOUGHTS THAT SET THE HEART ON FIRE WE EXTINGUISH THE FLAME EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE DONE BY SHEDDING OUR BLOOD FOR THE PURPOSE
THE PRINCE COMMANDS IT YES YES SAID THE PRINCE BE FRANK DE GUICHE STAMMERED OUT A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
DEATH DOES NOT RECKON BY YEARS
THE LANDLORD CONTINUED
DE SAINT-AIGNAN WHO WAS DRESSED IN A ROSE-COLORED COSTUME WITH FACE AND RIBBONS OF THE SAME COLOR AND IN ADDITION PARTICULARLY ROSE-COLORED IN HIS IDEAS FOR THAT EVENING M
G 7 RIGHT SAID THE FRANCISCAN AND NOW SPEAK I HAVE A BODY OF TROOPS COMPOSED OF 50,000 MEN
D'ARTAGNAN SO YESTERDAY EVENING AH SAID ARAMIS WHOSE EYES SPARKLED FOR A MOMENT BUT BECAME IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AS UNMOVED AS BEFORE
SHE FELT TOO THAT DURING THE WHOLE OF THE DAY SO FRUITFUL IN FUTURE EVENTS SHE HAD ACTED UNJUSTLY IF NOT TREASONABLY TOWARDS ONE WHO LOVED HER WITH SUCH A DEPTH OF DEVOTION
THE CHEVALIER WAS READY TO SEEK A QUARREL WITH THESE TWO TROUBLESOME INTRUDERS WHEN LOOKING UP HE RECOGNIZED THE SUPERINTENDENT
HORSE-RIDING BATHING IN THE SEINE SPECTACLES DINNERS UNDER THE LEAFY COVERT OF THE TREES BALLS ON THE BANKS OF THE GRAND CANAL CONCERTS ETC ETC
AT SEA
THERE DO YOU SEE NOW I SEE ONE TWO FOUR MUSICIANS WITH THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND BEHIND THEM URGING THEM ON DE GUICHE HIMSELF
DURING THE LAST HALF-HOUR THE WEATHER ALSO HAD UNDERGONE A CHANGE
I WILL HASTEN FORWARD AND INFORM MADAME OF THE ACCIDENT WHICH HAS BEFALLEN ONE OF HER MAIDS OF HONOR AND IN FACT WHILE M
BUT IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL LOVE ME AND I SHALL ADORE YOU
WHEN IT SUITS ME TO BE LOVING I LOOK AT YOU
DO NOT FORCE ME TO SPEAK HOWEVER
WHAT DOES HE SAY PHILIP CONTINUED WITH THE SAME GRACIOUS AIR I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE MONSIEUR WHY THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN RECALLS YOU
ADIEU AND BRING US BACK A PRINCESS WHO WILL NOT TALK WITH HER OWN PORTRAIT TOO MUCH YES SET OFF AND LOSE NO TIME
MALICORNE AND MANICAMP
AND TO LOUVIERE THE VERY SAME MONEY DOWN NO
THUS TYRCIS AND AMYNTAS HAD BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY PHYLLIS AND GALATEA
AS HE GLIDED ALONG UNDER THE COVERED WALK HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND OBSERVED AT THE TOP OF THE WALL A WOMAN PERCHED UPON A LADDER IN EAGER CONVERSATION WITH A MAN SEATED ON A BRANCH OF A CHESTNUT-TREE WHOSE HEAD ALONE COULD BE SEEN THE REST OF HIS BODY BEING CONCEALED IN THE THICK COVERT OF THE CHESTNUT
CHAPTER XXXIII
THE EVENING VISIT WAS REPLACED BY A MEETING EITHER AT THE KING'S ASSEMBLY OR AT MADAME'S WHICH THE QUEEN ATTENDED OBLIGINGLY ENOUGH OUT OF REGARD TO HER TWO SONS
IT IS PRECISELY UPON THAT POINT I WISH TO HAVE THE HONOR OF ADDRESSING A WORD TO YOU VERY WELL MONSIEUR BUT LET YOUR REMARKS BE BRIEF ONE QUESTION IS ALL I ASK
MONSEIGNEUR SAID THE VALET THEY ARE LOOKING FOR HIM HE CANNOT BE FAR DISTANT I HAVE NOT GIVEN HIM ANY COMMISSION TO EXECUTE I WILL GO AND SEE MONSEIGNEUR REPLIED THE VALET AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR
THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS SOMEWHAT CALMER ALTHOUGH THE GALE STILL CONTINUED
AND THE PORTRAIT HE HAD DRAWN HOWEVER GROTESQUELY INFLATED IT MIGHT BE HAD FOUND FAVOR IN CERTAIN EARS IN WHICH THE PERFECTIONS OF THE SHEPHERD DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED
IT IS LA VALLIERE AND THE KING THEY BOTH EXCLAIMED TOGETHER
HAVE I INDEED SAID ANYTHING YOU SHOULD ANSWER WITH SUCH A CRUEL REMARK
YOUR FRIEND HAS OCCUPIED IT DURING THE LAST WEEK SAID THE LANDLORD POINTING TO MALICORNE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE
NO NO SAID ARAMIS
NEVER HA HA SAID BAISEMEAUX IN A LOW TONE OF VOICE
YOU OWE HER REVENGE
YOUR MAJESTY IN OMITTING THE DANCE OF THE FRUITS WOULD BE LOSING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENE IN THE BALLET
MONSIEUR WAS STILL ENJOYING THE EFFECT OF HIS REMARK WHEN THE KING WAS ANNOUNCED
NO DOUBT THEY ARE PERSONS WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTED TO THE KING
AS FOR PORTHOS HE HAD SUPPED VERY AGREEABLY OFF A ROAST LEG OF MUTTON TWO PHEASANTS AND A PERFECT HEAP OF CRAY-FISH
YOU WISHED FOR AN AUDIENCE I BELIEVE HE SAID COLDLY
DE GUICHE TO MADAME NOTHING MORE
YOU EXCUSE YOURSELF
AND NOW YOU WILL TELL ME PERHAPS THAT MY LOVE WILL DESPISE ME
I SEE YOU HAVE AN OPEN HAND AND AN ARM THAT CAN REACH A GREAT WAY ADIEU ADIEU AND ARAMIS LEFT CARRYING WITH HIM THE GOVERNOR'S BEST WISHES
I MUST LEARN IF IT BE SO AND MUST JUDGE OF THAT FOR MYSELF SAID THE MARQUISE
ONE OF THOSE ARM-CHAIR SOLDIERS THE BUCKINGHAMS ARE LOYAL AND BRAVE SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA COURAGEOUSLY
FOR PITY'S SAKE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WHAT
SAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME--SAY IT I INSIST UPON IT WELL I OBEY YOU THAT IS TRULY FORTUNATE MONSIEUR IS DEAD AH PESTE THAT'S NEWS
BUT WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF SIGHING SMILING AND KNEELING AT A DISTANCE
WITH REGARD TO THOSE HIGHER PLACED AFFECTIONS RECOGNIZING THEIR DIGNITY AND THEIR ILLIMITABLE INFLUENCE ACKNOWLEDGING IN THEM A CERTAIN ETIQUETTE AND DISPLAY--A MONARCH NOT ONLY DID NOT ACT IN A MANNER DEROGATORY TO HIS HIGH POSITION BUT FOUND EVEN REPOSE SECURITY MYSTERY AND GENERAL RESPECT THEREIN
THE CONVERSATIONS WITH DE GUICHE WERE GRADUALLY ASSUMING A TONE OF INTEREST WHICH MIGHT UNMISTAKABLY BE RECOGNIZED AS THE PRELUDE OF A DEEP-SEATED ATTACHMENT
HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF BUT SLIGHTLY WITH HIS TOILETTE AND SET OFF TO PAY HIS VISIT TO MADAME
OH SAID THE KING DRAWING HIMSELF UP TO HIS FULL HEIGHT UPON MY WORD THAT IS A MOST AMUSING JEST CERTAINLY
THE KING ENTERED FOLLOWED BY SAINT-AIGNAN
WHY DOES HE NOT MAKE USE OF HIS CREDIT THEN CONTINUED DE GUICHE
SHE CONTINUED
ONE COULD REALIZE THE LIFE LED BY THIS NOCTURNAL AND INVISIBLE POPULATION FROM THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS THAT SUDDENLY TOOK PLACE AMONG THE LEAVES
THE TWO QUEENS TURNED ROUND AT THE SOUND AND MONSIEUR ENTERED
OH THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WE CANNOT ASK MONSIEUR FOR ANYTHING WHY SO BECAUSE WE ARE NOT ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIM A GREAT ABSURDITY TOO SAID MALICORNE PROMPTLY
YOU ARE DYING OF LOVE YOU ARE MAD DE WARDES MADNESS IT WOULD BE I ADMIT IF MADAME WERE REALLY INDIFFERENT TO YOUR MARTYRDOM
HE REMAINED FOR A MOMENT COMPLETELY BEWILDERED
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN THE KING'S FAVOR IS ENTIRELY WITHDRAWN FROM M
WHY TO BE PITIED
A DEER HURRYING BY PERHAPS I AM ONLY AFRAID OF MEN SAID ATHENAIS
IF I WERE TO BE SEEN WITH YOU AT SUCH AN HOUR WHAT WOULD BE SAID OF ME YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE WOULD ACQUIT YOU SAID MANICAMP SENTENTIOUSLY
BUT I WISH TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW IT WAS THAT I HAVE NOT OFFENDED YOU OF MY OWN ACCORD IN THE FIRST PLACE SAID THE KING IN WHAT WAY CAN YOU POSSIBLY HAVE OFFENDED ME
A YOUNG MAN
COME THEN LET US BE MORE CANDID STILL AND AS FRANK AS IF YOU WERE MAKING YOUR OWN CONFESSION TO HEAVEN
HE COMPARED WITH HIS OWN PETTY VANITY THE PRODIGIOUS PRIDE OF OFFENDED MAJESTY
AT ONE MOMENT IT FLEW SUSPENDED ON THE CREST OF THE FOAMING WAVES THEN SUDDENLY GLIDED DOWNWARDS TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF A RAGING ABYSS WHERE IT SEEMED UTTERLY LOST
CHAPTER LV
THE KING ALSO THE WHOLE COURT AS WELL REPLIED ANNE OF AUSTRIA
MANICAMP STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT AND ASSUMED A VERY CEREMONIOUS DEMEANOR
WE WILL WALK UP AND DOWN ARM IN ARM UNDER THE TREES WHILE YOU TELL ME YOUR PITIFUL TALE HE DREW THE DOLEFUL GOVERNOR INTO THE COURTYARD TOOK HIM BY THE ARM AS HE HAD SAID AND IN HIS ROUGH GOOD-HUMORED WAY CRIED
THAT IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT I THINK OH
LET US NOT DISPUTE ABOUT IT AND WHY NOT BECAUSE DURING THE YEAR WHICH I HAVE KNOWN YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD ME TURNED OUT OF DOORS TWENTY TIMES IF I DID NOT PLEASE YOU INDEED
BUT THERE AGAIN THE KING'S ANGER PAUSED CHECKED BY REASON
CHAPTER VII
A CROWD OF CURIOUS IDLERS FOLLOWED THE RICHLY DRESSED ATTENDANTS AMONGST WHOM THEY MISTOOK THE STEWARD AND THE SECRETARY FOR THE MASTER AND HIS FRIEND
YOU HAVE NO OCCASION FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT
YOU HAVE A VERY TREACHEROUS MEMORY I FEAR
THIS IS TOO BAD
THE RESULT WAS THE KING PASSED IN REVIEW BEFORE HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THE LAST EIGHT DAYS AND DECIDED THAT FAULTS COULD BE FOUND IN HIS FETES
I WAS LOOKING FOR WHOM I WAS LOOKING FOR MADAME MADAME IS AT THE BATHS AND THE KING SAID MONSIEUR IN A TONE WHICH MADE THE QUEEN TREMBLE
I WOULD WILLINGLY EXCHANGE MY PROFITS FOR YOURS DON'T SPEAK OF PROFITS TO ME IF YOU WISH TO SAVE ME THE BITTEREST ANGUISH OF MIND WHY DO YOU LOOK FIRST ON ONE SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER AS IF YOU WERE AFRAID OF BEING ARRESTED YOURSELF YOU WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO ARREST OTHERS I WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER ANY ONE COULD SEE OR LISTEN TO US
YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN SHE PLEASES SHE CAN MAKE THE PLEASANT HOURS PASS LIKE MINUTES
8 SPEAK IN SPANISH SAID THE FRANCISCAN SHOWING THE LIVELIEST ATTENTION
INTERPRET THAT AS YOU PLEASE
D'HERBLAY M
THE RUMORS WHICH IDLY PASS BY A GENTLEMAN'S EARS DO NOT REMAIN THERE
WELL OUR FRENCH PERFUMERS YOU KNOW VERY WELL MADAME FOR YOU HAVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN ASKED FOR IT WITHOUT SUCCESS--OUR FRENCH PERFUMERS I SAY HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PROCURE THIS SCENT
BE CONVINCED THEREFORE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF COQUETRY
FOR I DO NOT RETAIN THE SLIGHTEST ANIMOSITY IN MY HEART AGAINST YOU THIS LAST BLOW OVERWHELMED DE WARDES
LONG LIFE TO YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS REPLIED DE GUICHE ENCOURAGED BY THE TONE OF PHILIP'S VOICE
SIRE SAID LA VALLIERE ALMOST OVERCOME BUT MAKING A POWERFUL EFFORT OVER HERSELF THINK OF THE ANXIETIES YOUR MAJESTY WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT TO ON MY ACCOUNT
MY BROTHER HAS AN EXALTED IDEA OF SOVEREIGN POWER
THE KING WHO HAD DONE NOTHING BUT LOOK AT AND ADMIRE MADAME SHORTLY AFTERWARDS LEFT THE RECEPTION-ROOM ACCOMPANIED BY THE TWO QUEENS
UPON MY HONOR MY LORD THIS IS INDEED A MOST LOVELY FACE BUT LOOK AT ME COUNT LOOK AT ME SAID THE PRINCE ENDEAVORING TO DIRECT UPON HIMSELF THE ATTENTION OF THE COUNT WHO WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE PORTRAIT
QUICK QUICK THE BOAT FLEW OVER THE WAVES BUT THE SEA ROSE FASTER THAN THE BOAT COULD APPROACH
THAT IF YOU DO NOT PLACE A BETTER WATCH OVER YOURSELF THAN YOU HAVE HITHERTO DONE ONE DAY OR OTHER SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT WILL CAUSE AN EXPLOSION
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT MY DEAR FELLOW
SHE INSTITUTED LOTTERIES IN HER APARTMENTS
IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT
THE MARQUISE WAS NOT ONE TO WEEP WHEN ACTION WAS NECESSARY NOR TO WASTE TIME IN BEWAILING A MISFORTUNE AS LONG AS MEANS STILL EXISTED OF RELIEVING IT
HE BOWED AND SAID
MALICORNE WHO IT WILL BE REMEMBERED WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS INN BY WAY OF DEPLORING HIS BEING TURNED OUT OF IT BEING THEN ABSORBED IN HIS OWN AFFAIRS HAD NOT TOLD MONTALAIS ALL THAT COULD BE SAID ABOUT THIS CURIOUS INN
BUT I VOWED THAT IF PROVIDENCE EVER PLACED ME IN A POSITION OF INDEPENDENCE EVEN WERE IT THAT OF A WORKMAN OF THE LOWER CLASSES WHO GAINS HER BREAD BY HER LABOR I WOULD NEVER SUFFER HUMILIATION AGAIN
HEART EYES SHE SAID
I HAVE SEEN MANY PERSONS VERY LIKE THE ONE WE ARE SPEAKING OF
DE MALICORNE
DE MALICORNE
WOULD YOU BECOME PROUD MONSIEUR FOUQUET IF THE KING WERE TO BE JEALOUS OF YOU I SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD SIRE SINCE THE VERY DAY ON WHICH YOUR MAJESTY WERE TO BE JEALOUS OF VAUX I SHOULD POSSESS SOMETHING WORTHY OF BEING OFFERED TO YOU VERY WELL MONSIEUR FOUQUET PREPARE YOUR FETE AND OPEN THE DOOR OF YOUR HOUSE AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE IT IS FOR YOUR MAJESTY TO FIX THE DAY THIS DAY MONTH THEN HAS YOUR MAJESTY ANY FURTHER COMMANDS NOTHING MONSIEUR FOUQUET EXCEPT FROM THE PRESENT MOMENT UNTIL THEN TO HAVE YOU NEAR ME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I HAVE THE HONOR TO FORM ONE OF YOUR MAJESTY'S PARTY FOR THE PROMENADE VERY GOOD
THIS TIME SOME ONE IS REALLY COMING SAID MADAME
SEND MANICAMP TO ME
I AM SURE YOUR TENANTS IN NORMANDY WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU THE KING AFTER THIS PITILESS ATTACK TURNED HIS BACK ON THE POOR COMTE WHOSE TURN IT WAS NOW TO BECOME PALE
THEN THE CAUSE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT IS A MYSTERY--A STATE SECRET OH NO
ARE YOU MAD CRIED BAISEMEAUX
WHAT AM I THEN YOU ARE YOU PERCEIVE SAID THE KING THE DIVINITY WHO DISSIPATES THE STORM AND BRINGS BACK FINE WEATHER IN FACT EVEN AS THE KING SPOKE A RAY OF SUNLIGHT STREAMED THROUGH THE FOREST AND CAUSED THE RAIN-DROPS WHICH RESTED UPON THE LEAVES OR FELL VERTICALLY AMONG THE OPENINGS IN THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO GLISTEN LIKE DIAMONDS
IN THAT CASE GIVE ME THE RECOMMENDATION BACK AGAIN WHAT TO DO TO ADD TWO WORDS TO IT TWO WORDS YES
LAUGH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE
THE QUEEN MUST BE FULL OF UNEASINESS
IT MIGHT BE FORETOLD THAT THE DAY WHEN HIS REAL CHARACTER WOULD BE DISPLAYED WOULD BE THE DAWN OF A NEW SOVEREIGNTY
ALONG THE WAY THEY ENCOUNTER A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG SPY NAMED SIMPLY MILADY WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO DISGRACE QUEEN ANNE OF AUSTRIA BEFORE HER HUSBAND LOUIS XIII AND TAKE HER REVENGE UPON THE FOUR FRIENDS
I DO NOT ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF TO SUCH INCONVENIENCE AND A LETTER MERELY YOU MISTAKE MY POSITION RAOUL
SHE IS LIKE A BIRD WHICH ALWAYS WARBLING AT ONE MOMENT SKIMS THE GROUND AT THE NEXT RISES FLUTTERING IN PURSUIT OF A BUTTERFLY THEN RESTS ITSELF UPON THE TOPMOST BRANCH OF A TREE WHERE IT DEFIES THE BIRD-CATCHERS EITHER TO COME AND SEIZE IT OR TO ENTRAP IT IN THEIR NETS THE PORTRAIT BORE SUCH A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO MONTALAIS THAT ALL EYES WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS HER
THE CHEVALIER WHETHER HE HAD SOME TREACHEROUS OBJECT IN VIEW OR FROM IMPRUDENCE DID NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO DISSIMULATE
CHAPTER XII
BESIDES IN THIS CASE WE ARE NOT PLAYING FOR VERY HEAVY STAKES HOW SO
LOUIS WAS APPROPRIATED BY MADAME WHO OVERWHELMED HIM WITH INQUIRIES AND NO ONE IN THE WORLD KNEW HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS BETTER THAN SHE DID
BUT STAY A MOMENT
SECOND BERTAUDIERE IS THE PERSON WHO OCCUPIES THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE TOWER OF THE BERTAUDIERE SO THAT BERTAUDIERE IS THE NAME OF ONE OF THE TOWERS OF THE BASTILE
BUT THIS MORNING I WAS WITH HIM AS HE WAS DRESSING AND I LET A BOTTLE OF BLACKING FALL OVER HIS NEW DRESS AND HE FLEW AT ME SWORD IN HAND SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE MY ESCAPE
IF YOU DON'T COME BACK WHAT WILL HAPPEN MONSEIGNEUR I WILL HAVE YOU SENT TO THE BASTILE WELL SAID DE GUICHE LAUGHING HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS MONSEIGNEUR IS DECIDEDLY THE COUNTERPART OF HER ROYAL HIGHNESS MADAME
SHE DENIED HAVING RECEIVED ANY LETTER
WAIT UNTIL I RETURN
AND HAD NO SUSPICION AS HE WALKED EVERY DAY BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE O'CLOCK AFTER HIS DINNER UPON THE PLACE SAINTE-CATHERINE IN HIS GRAY COAT CUT AFTER THE FASHION OF LOUIS XIII
WELL THEN TELL US FRANKLY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF HER PERSONAL APPEARANCE RETURNED DE GUICHE STUPEFIED
CATCHING GLIMPSES AT LAST OF THE KING AND LA VALLIERE THEY SEEMED TO HAVE FOUND WHAT THEY WERE SEEKING
DE WARDES SPEAKS ILL OF M
MANICAMP AND MALICORNE
I HAVE FIVE THOUSAND PISTOLES IN THE SADDLE-BAGS THE GOVERNOR'S COUNTENANCE BECAME SO RADIANT THAT IF THE PRISONERS HAD SEEN HIM THEY WOULD HAVE IMAGINED SOME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL BLOOD HAD ARRIVED
EVERY ONE HURRIED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE WINDOW WHICH HAD A BALCONY OUTSIDE FROM WHICH ALL THE DETAILS OF THE SLOW AND FORMAL PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE COULD BE SEEN
MONSIEUR MALICORNE
YOU DO NOT ANSWER--YOU SMILE
D'HERBLAY HIMSELF COMES TO THE BASTILE AND BRINGS ME FIVE THOUSAND PISTOLES TO DISTRIBUTE BETWEEN MY CROCODILES YOU OWE ARAMIS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS THEN THAT IS THE VERY THING WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF MY DESPAIR FOR I ONLY OWE HIM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU HE CAME AND SETTLED WITH THE VAMPIRES ONLY TWO YEARS
AT LAST THE ADMIRAL WITH STUDIED DELAY GAVE THE LAST ORDERS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF THE BOATS
THE LATTER ARRIVED BY EXPRESS AND SEEMS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FROM CALAIS
YOU SPEAK OF A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH TO ME AND THEN ASK IF I WILL LISTEN WELL I JUDGE OF IT BY MY OWN CASE
NOW TELL ME SAID FOUQUET AFTER HAVING INSTALLED HIS GUEST IN AN ARMCHAIR AND SEATED HIMSELF BY HIS SIDE TELL ME MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY WHAT IS OUR POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE BELLE-ISLE AFFAIR AND WHETHER YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY NEWS ABOUT IT EVERYTHING IS GOING ON IN THAT DIRECTION AS WE WISH REPLIED ARAMIS
HOW IN WHAT MANNER CAN I HAVE EVER BEEN INDISCREET TO SUCH AN EXTENT I MEAN THAT YOUR EYES YOUR LOOKS YOUR SIGHS PROCLAIM IN SPITE OF YOURSELF THAT EXAGGERATED FEELING WHICH LEADS AND HURRIES A MAN BEYOND HIS OWN CONTROL
BUCKINGHAM IN UTTER HOPELESSNESS CAST A LOOK OF DESPAIR AT THE PRINCESS OF SUPPLICATION TOWARDS THE QUEEN AND DIRECTED A GLANCE FULL OF ANGER TOWARDS THE ADMIRAL
THERE WILL BE NO ONE LEFT IN PARIS TO-MORROW AND HEREUPON HE SALUTED MALICORNE WITH GREAT CEREMONY WHOSE HANDSOME DRESS GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF A PRINCE
AN INNOCENT DECEPTION READILY PERMITTED IN YOUNG GIRLS WHOM MEN WISH TO TAKE BY SURPRISE
YOU ARE RIGHT MONSIEUR SAID RAOUL MASTERING HIS EMOTION I AM ONLY ACQUAINTED WITH MY FATHER'S NAME
STOOP ATHENAIS YOU ARE SO TALL MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE STOOPED AS SHE WAS TOLD AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT THEY SAW TWO GENTLEMEN APPROACHING THEIR HEADS BENT DOWN WALKING ARM IN ARM ON THE FINE GRAVEL WALK RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE BANK
I ASK YOU WHAT WAS THE DATE OF THE LETTER YOU WROTE TO ME TO RETAIN APARTMENTS HERE REPEATED THE LANDLORD PRESSING THE QUESTION
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPLAINT TO MAKE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ADDRESS IT TO ME INASMUCH AS IT WAS I WHO SUPPLIED THE PLANS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE TENTS MOREOVER I WOULD BEG YOU TO OBSERVE MONSIEUR THAT THE TERM BARRACK IS A HIGHLY OBJECTIONABLE ONE ADDED MANICAMP GRACIOUSLY
I REGRET DE GUICHE IS NOT HERE OH
DO YOU OBSERVE IT YES
BESIDES THERE IS NOTHING IN IT WHICH SHOULD ASTONISH YOU FOR WE HAVE FORESEEN IT ALL ALONG YES
WHY YOUR MAJESTY HAS A THOUSAND REASONS TO BE ANGRY WITH THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS OF SO HAZARDOUS A JOKE
BUT HE FEARED TOO THAT RAOUL LEFT ALONE WITH DE GUICHE MIGHT YET INFLUENCE HIM TO CHANGE HIS MIND
BUT AT ALL EVENTS THRICE A WEEK THEY HAVE A GOOD DISH AT THEIR DINNER REALLY YOU ARE QUITE A PHILANTHROPIST MY DEAR GOVERNOR AND YOU WILL RUIN YOURSELF NO
COME MALICORNE HERE IS THE LADDER MALICORNE HAD ALREADY STRETCHED OUT ONE OF HIS LEGS TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE WALL WHEN MANICAMP SAID IN A WHISPER HUSH WHAT'S THE MATTER INQUIRED MONTALAIS
ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE IMAGINED IT AN ENCHANTED HOUSE
THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY ATTACKED AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES ALMOST INSTINCTIVELY
THE KING STOOD ALMOST GAPING WITH ASTONISHMENT AS HE LOOKED AT THE COMTE WHO BOWING LOWLY APPROACHED LOUIS WITH THE PROFOUNDEST RESPECT
SHOW ME THE OAK
THEN CALLING TO SAINT-AIGNAN WHO APPROACHED WITH GREAT HUMILITY HE SAID I HOPE COMTE THAT MADEMOISELLE DE LA VALLIERE WILL KINDLY CONFER A LITTLE OF HER FRIENDSHIP UPON YOU IN RETURN FOR THAT WHICH I HAVE VOWED TO HER ETERNALLY SAINT-AIGNAN BENT HIS KNEE BEFORE LA VALLIERE SAYING HOW HAPPY INDEED WOULD SUCH AN HONOR MAKE ME I WILL SEND YOUR COMPANION BACK TO YOU SAID THE KING
AND INSTEAD OF DELAYING OUR DEPARTURE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS WE WILL SET OFF AT ONCE
SINCE YOU HAVE SOME CHAUSSES AND A POURPOINT LEFT PUT YOUR LEGS INTO THE FIRST AND YOUR BACK INTO THE OTHER
PRAY REMEMBER WITH PRECISION THE WORDS YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED
THE CARRIAGE THEREFORE DID NOT SIMPLY ROLL ALONG--IT FLEW
THAT DE GUICHE RETURNED AFTER HE HAD BEEN SENT AWAY IS CERTAINLY SERIOUS ENOUGH BUT ALL ITS SERIOUSNESS DISAPPEARS WHEN I LEARN THAT DE GUICHE HAS RETURNED AT THE VERY MOMENT MADAME TROUBLES HERSELF NO LONGER ABOUT HIM
END OF TEN YEARS LATER
I OUGHT EVEN TO ADD,--REMEMBER IT IS THE DRYAD WHO IS SPEAKING,--THAT ONE OF THE SHEPHERDESSES AMARYLLIS I BELIEVE WAS COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO THE NECESSITY OF LOVING AND YET SHE DID NOT POSITIVELY DENY THAT SHE HAD ALLOWED THE IMAGE OF A CERTAIN SHEPHERD TO TAKE REFUGE IN HER HEART WAS IT AMYNTAS OR TYRCIS AMYNTAS MADAME SAID SAINT-AIGNAN MODESTLY
SHE SPOKE AS A WOMAN BUT CONCEALED THE INSTINCTS OF A WOLF
YOU BELIEVE THAT MADAME WILL LOVE YOU RAOUL I BELIEVE NOTHING
WAS YOUR PLAY AS GOOD AS HIS MAJESTY'S ASKED ARAMIS BY WAY OF BEGINNING THE CONVERSATION
MANICAMP IT IS A FACT OR AT LEAST EVERYBODY SAYS SO SILENCE CRIED THE COUNT
CAN A MONARCH SUCH AS YOU ARE WITHOUT ANY PREPARATION FALL AT THE FEET OF A GIRL LIKE LA VALLIERE AH
ADIEU COUNT SAID THE CHEVALIER WITHOUT SEEMING IN ANY WAY TO HAVE NOTICED THE COUNT'S SLIGHT
MONSIEUR DE MANICAMP
THE LATTER HAD ALREADY EMANCIPATED HERSELF FROM HER ASSUMED TIMIDITY WHICH SHE ONLY NEEDED FOR THE PRESENTATION AND FOR HER REVERENCES
YOU WILL THEN ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN LEAGUES TO GO INSTEAD OF THIRTY YOU ARE A WONDERFULLY CLEVER FELLOW
BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT IT IS A QUARREL OF M
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE ROOM
IN MY OPINION SHE IS A VERY CHARMING GIRL I VERILY BELIEVE YOU ARE JESTING I
AND YET ON THE CONTRARY YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND ME VERY WELL
SINCE THE FOOLISH REMARK I MADE AND MY STILL MORE SILLY FAINTING YESTERDAY EVERY ONE HERE IS MAKING REMARKS ABOUT US SPEAK FOR YOURSELF SAID MONTALAIS LAUGHING SPEAK FOR YOURSELF AND FOR TONNAY-CHARENTE
I REPEAT THE OFFER FOUQUET ROSE PROFOUNDLY AGITATED
FOUQUET'S FOR HE IS A MAN WHOSE HAND IS ALWAYS OPEN I SWEAR THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE VENTURED TO ASK M
HOW MUCH IS IT THERE IS NO HURRY NEVER MIND LET US RECKON IT ALL UP ALL THE SAME
FOUQUET RANG IN A MANNER TO ALARM THE VERY DEAD
RAOUL FEARED THAT THE IMPATIENT YOUNG MAN MIGHT POSSIBLY MAKE THE PROPOSITION HIMSELF AND HURRIED FORTH BEFORE HIM
HIS SALUTATION WAS PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO DE WARDES WITH WHOM HE WAS UNACQUAINTED AND WHOSE FEATURES ON HIS PERCEIVING RAOUL HAD ASSUMED A STRANGE STERNNESS OF EXPRESSION
QUIT THAT LAWYER'S LOGIC MY DEAR ANOTHER IMPOSSIBILITY
WE WERE GLAD TO HEAR YOU SPEAK IN THAT MANNER
MALICORNE HAD TAKEN TO MAKE HIS REVENUES FRUCTIFY TWELVE THOUSAND LIVRES MIGHT RISE TO TWENTY THOUSAND
WHEN MY HEART HAS BEEN ONCE WOUNDED IT REMAINS SO ALWAYS BUT M
WHENEVER A DEAD SILENCE TAKES PLACE IMMEDIATELY THE HUSBAND MAKES HIS APPEARANCE IN HIS WIFE'S ROOMS
BUT IF INSTEAD OF BEING COMFORTABLY SEATED ON THE TOP OF THE WALL AS YOU ARE YOU WERE SITTING ON THIS BRANCH AS IF YOU WERE ON HORSEBACK YOU WOULD LIKE AUGUSTUS ASPIRE TO DESCEND BE PATIENT MY DEAR M
MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND THE GENTLEMEN ACCORDINGLY DESERTED HER COMPANIONS AND UNDER THE PRETEXT OF COMPLIMENTING HER UPON HER SUCCESS PRESSED IN A CIRCLE AROUND HER
IN THE LAST ETEXT
THE KING IS CHARMED WITH MY LOTTERY BUT I REPLIED MADAME AM NOT SO GREATLY CHARMED
WE CAN LEAVE HIM HERE YES THAT IS TRUE HE KNOWS NOTHING POSITIVELY NOTHING
HE WAS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE JEALOUS
HE CARES FOR NO OTHER
THIS FAMOUS INN AN ARCHITECTURAL EPIGRAM AGAINST THAT HALF OF THE HUMAN RACE WHICH RENDERS EXISTENCE DELIGHTFUL WAS SITUATED AT FONTAINEBLEAU IN THE FIRST TURNING ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE WHICH DIVIDES THE ROAD FROM PARIS THE LARGE ARTERY THAT CONSTITUTES IN ITSELF ALONE THE ENTIRE TOWN OF FONTAINEBLEAU
BUT WITH A VIEW OF INSURING THE EXECUTION OF THIS ORDER IN A ROYAL MANNER ONE LAST QUESTION WAS NECESSARY AND LOUIS XIV
I WAS CHARMED WITH HIM IT WAS NOT YOU SAID MADAME
NEXT THE BEAUTIFUL HEDGES OF ELDER AND THORN WHICH EMBRACED AS THOUGH WITHIN TWO GREEN AND FLOWERY ARMS THE HOUSE OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
SIXTY WELL THAT IS A TOLERABLY ROUND NUMBER IN FORMER TIMES MY LORD THERE WERE DURING CERTAIN YEARS AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED STILL A MINIMUM OF SIXTY IS NOT TO BE GRUMBLED AT PERHAPS NOT
WHEN SHE SMILES ON THE CONTRARY NATURE RESUMES HER JOLLITY AND THE BIRDS FOR A BRIEF MOMENT SILENCED RECOMMENCE THEIR SONGS AMID THE LEAFY COVERT OF THE TREES
FEAR NOTHING
ONE OF THE PRINCE'S ATTENDANTS HAPPENED TO BE NEAR HIM OVERHEARD HIS REMARK AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS YOUR HIGHNESS STILL THE SAME ANSWER
SEEING MONSIEUR RISE FROM THE TABLE MANICAMP NAPKIN IN HAND ROSE ALSO
SEND ME THE CORDIAL IMMEDIATELY GIVE ME YOUR BLESSING AT LEAST MONSEIGNEUR IN MY MIND I DO
I HATE M
I HAVE DECLARED MY SENTIMENTS TO YOU CONTINUED MALICORNE
BUT YOUR MAJESTY IS WELL AWARE THAT NO SECRET CAN POSSIBLY EXIST FOR YOU WELL WHAT IS HER NAME MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY-CHARENTE IS SHE PRETTY EXCEEDINGLY SIRE
WELL CLOSE BESIDE THE OAK THERE IS A PRETTY LITTLE SPRING WHICH RUNS MURMURINGLY OVER THE PEBBLES BETWEEN BANKS OF FORGET-ME-NOTS AND DAFFODILS I BELIEVE YOU ARE CORRECT SAID THE KING WITH SOME UNEASINESS AND LISTENING WITH SOME ANXIETY TO HIS SISTER-IN-LAW'S NARRATIVE
HE HAS BEEN RECRUITING WHILE WE WERE READING
WRETCHED KNAVES EXCLAIMED THE DUKE DRAWING HIMSELF UP WITH A HAUGHTY GESTURE WHICH SPRINKLED THEM WITH BLOOD OBEY DIRECTLY
BUT SINCE SUCH IS YOUR DESIRE I WILL CONFORM MYSELF TO IT
WHICH AS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED HAD RESERVED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INDEFINITENESS MOST PAINFUL FOR SO LOVING A HEART AS HIS
YOU ATTACK M
WHO IS THAT MONTALAIS INQUIRED DE WARDES AND THAT LA VALLIERE
IS IT FOR ANYONE TO WHOM MANICAMP MAY HAPPEN TO BE AFFIANCED
YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME HE THEN REMARKED WHY YOU ABSENTED YOURSELF
ONLY THE GENTLEMAN IS SPEAKING TO A MADMAN
WHAT A PITY M
TO THE OFFICERS THERE HE WOULD SEEM LIKE A PALADIN OF THE TIME OF THE CRUSADES
I THANK MONSEIGNEUR AND I THANK MADAME COME COME SAID THE PRINCE YOU ARE A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION AND YOU KNOW I CANNOT DO WITHOUT YOU
HOWEVER PERMIT ME TO TELL YOU THAT PERSONALLY I REGRET EXCEEDINGLY THAT YOU ARE AT PRESENT SO SHORT OF MONEY BECAUSE I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU FOR SOME FOR YOURSELF FOR MYSELF OR SOME OF MY PEOPLE FOR MINE OR FOR OURS HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT BE EASY ON THAT SCORE
I AM TOLD HE EXCLAIMED THAT THE KING HAS TAKEN THE SUN AS HIS DEVICE
BEFORE THREE DAYS ARE PASSED THE RUIN OF THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL BE COMPLETE STAY SAID THE MARQUISE IN HER TURN SMILING THAT IS GOING A LITTLE FAST I SAID THREE DAYS BECAUSE I WISH TO DECEIVE MYSELF WITH A HOPE
AGAIN IN ANOTHER CORNER OF THE ROOM A GUITAR PLAYER WAS PLAYING SOME OF THE SPANISH SEGUEDILLAS TO WHICH MADAME HAD TAKEN THE GREATEST FANCY EVER SINCE SHE HAD HEARD THEM SUNG BY THE YOUNG QUEEN WITH A MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION OF VOICE
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN INQUIRED ARAMIS
INSTEAD OF DEVOTING YOURSELF TO FRIENDSHIPS WHICH ARE SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE INSTEAD OF ALARMING US BY YOUR RETIREMENT REMAIN ALWAYS IN OUR SOCIETY DO NOT LEAVE US LET US LIVE AS A UNITED FAMILY
AND DISMISSED COLBERT FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING AN AUDIENCE TO HIS TAILORS
THE KING LEFT MADAME IN A STATE OF AGITATION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT EVEN FOR HIMSELF TO HAVE EXPLAINED
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT I CAN FIGHT ALSO
THEIR APARTMENTS HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BEFOREHAND BY THEIR COURIERS OR SECRETARIES WHO HAD ARRIVED THE PREVIOUS EVENING OR THAT VERY MORNING
FORGIVE ME SIRE FOR THE EXPRESSIONS I HAVE USED
BESIDES I BEG YOU TO ATTEND DO NOT BE SO HASTILY PREJUDICED AGAINST LA VALLIERE
HAD YOU EVER SEEN IT BEFORE ONCE ONLY MADAME BUT LIKE ALL TRUE ENGLISHMEN YOU PREFER ENGLAND I PREFER MY OWN NATIVE LAND TO FRANCE REPLIED THE DUKE
TELL ME THEN TO WHAT EXTENT ATHENAIS AND I CAN RELY UPON YOU AS WE WILL TELL YOU IN WHAT WAY YOU CAN RELY UPON US I DO NOT CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION YOU HAVE PUT SAID LOUISE MUCH AGITATED
I NEVER COULD FIND HER IN THIS IMMENSE CITY MALICORNE DREW ANOTHER PACKET FROM HIS POCKET
BUT LET US HASTEN TO SAY SHE WAS MORE FREQUENTLY CHARMING THAN BEAUTIFUL
I CAME TO SEE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE AND TO REMIND YOU OF THOSE HABITS OF OUR EARLIER DAYS SO DELIGHTFUL TO REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO WANDER ABOUT TOGETHER AT VINCENNES AND SITTING BENEATH AN OAK OR IN SOME SYLVAN SHADE USED TO TALK OF THOSE WE LOVED AND WHO LOVED US DO YOU PROPOSE THAT WE SHOULD GO OUT TOGETHER NOW MY CARRIAGE IS HERE AND I HAVE THREE HOURS AT MY DISPOSAL I AM NOT DRESSED YET MARGUERITE
SUCH WAS THE NATURE OF LOUIS'S THOUGHTS DURING MASS
NAY I DID EVEN MORE FOR I WAS INCLINED TO GET OUT OF TEMPER
I AM IN LOVE YOU YES SO MUCH THE BETTER MY DEAR COMTE
BY THE BY I HAVE TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR HAVING OMITTED TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COMTE DE LA FERE WHILE PRONOUNCING THESE LATTER WORDS HE CLOSELY OBSERVED DE WARDES IN ORDER TO PERCEIVE WHAT EFFECT THE NAME OF RAOUL'S FATHER WOULD PRODUCE UPON HIM
THE DUKE HAS NOT ACQUIRED A STEADY FOOTING YET SAID THE QUEEN-MOTHER IN FRENCH AND THAT MAY POSSIBLY BE HIS REASON FOR WISHING TO FIND HIMSELF ON FIRM LAND AGAIN THE YOUNG MAN OVERHEARD THIS REMARK TURNED SUDDENLY PALE AND LETTING HIS HANDS FALL IN GREAT DISCOURAGEMENT BY HIS SIDE DREW ASIDE MINGLING IN ONE SIGH HIS OLD AFFECTION AND HIS NEW HATREDS
I AM NOW GOING TO GET RID OF M
LASTLY MONSIEUR WHO LOVES NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
LOUIS AS HE WITHDREW INVOLUNTARILY TOUCHED WITH HIS LIPS THE ARM WHICH WAS NOT WITHHELD AND THE PRINCESS HAVING THANKED HER ROYAL EQUERRY EVERY ONE SPRANG TO HIS SADDLE AT THE SAME MOMENT
I WAS NOT DECEIVED
AND AS THIS NAME RESOUNDED THROUGH HIS WHOLE BEING A CLOUD SEEMED TO RISE FROM HIS BREAST TO HIS EYES SO THAT HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD ANYTHING MORE
IN THAT CASE I PITY HER POOR GIRL
PARIS HAS RECEIVED THE LAST TAX VERY WELL AH
AS YOU HAVE REMARKED THAT IS MY AFFAIR
I DID NOT SAY A ROYAL COURT MADAME REPLIED MONTALAIS
TELL ME ONLY I ENTREAT YOU THAT I MAY RELY UPON YOUR FULL AND COMPLETE FORGIVENESS I HAVE BUT ONE REPLY TO MAKE TO YOU MONSIEUR SAID LA VALLIERE SOMEWHAT IMPATIENTLY AND I HOPE THAT WILL SATISFY YOU
FOR HER SHALL BE THE FLOWER THAT I MAY PLUCK FOR YOU THE FOND THOUGHTS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE INSPIRED ME
I DON'T SAY THAT--MY AFFECTION ENOUGH HENRIETTA I AGAIN ENTREAT YOU
ANOTHER'S SMILE INVITED HERS
THE MEMBERS OF THAT FAMILY I REPEAT ARE LOYAL AND DISCREET AND THE RIGHTS OF HOSPITALITY ARE SURE TO BE RESPECTED BY THEM THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM IS AN ENGLISHMAN MADAME SAID PHILIP AND MAY I ASK IF THE ENGLISH SO VERY RELIGIOUSLY RESPECT WHAT BELONGS TO PRINCES OF FRANCE ANNE BLUSHED A SECOND TIME AND TURNED ASIDE UNDER THE PRETEXT OF TAKING HER PEN FROM HER DESK AGAIN BUT IN REALITY TO CONCEAL HER CONFUSION FROM HER SON
AS FOR DE GUICHE HE VERY PROBABLY DID NOT FIND THE ARGUMENT SO CONVINCING FOR HE MERELY SIGNIFIED HIS OPINION BY A GESTURE WHICH MOREOVER EXHIBITED IN A MARKED MANNER SOME INDECISION OF MIND ON THE SUBJECT
BELONGING TO WHAT ORDERS THERE ARE JESUITS AUGUSTINES AND CORDELIERS
HE WILL FLEECE YOU COMPLETELY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT I LEND WITHOUT INTEREST SAID MALICORNE SMILING
DE WARDES WHO THIS WOMAN WAS WHO PLACED THE KNIFE IN THE HAND OF YOUR FATHER'S MURDERER A CRY ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF ALL PRESENT
DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE HOW THAT INSOLENT DUKE OF NORFOLK IS KILLING ME WITH HIS ATTENTIONS AND DEVOTIONS TO YOU HENRIETTA HEARD THIS REMARK
DE MAZARIN AND MAKES USE OF WITH RESPECT TO M
AND A GOOD HOUR WAS EMPLOYED BY HIM IN GOING OVER AGAIN IN MEMORY THE EMBROIDERIES THE TAPESTRIES THE BILLS OF FARE OF THE VARIOUS BANQUETS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE TRIUMPHAL ARCHES THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE ILLUMINATIONS AND FIREWORKS ALL THE OFFSPRING OF THE CLERK COLBERT'S INVENTION
MADAME HAS SO MANAGED MATTERS THAT I AM STILL JEALOUS OF WHOM IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS IT POSSIBLE YOU HAVE NOT REMARKED IT
SO THAT WHILE YOU HAVE A JEALOUS HUSBAND TO DEAL WITH I SHALL HAVE PERPETUALLY PRESENT BEFORE ME A SPECTER OF JEALOUSY WITH SWOLLEN EYES A CADAVEROUS FACE AND SINISTER LOOKS POOR KING MURMURED MADAME AS SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE KING'S HAND
I WAS TOLD THAT YOU COMPLAINED OF A WANT OF CONFIDENCE AND ATTENTION ON MADAME'S PART AND I DID NOT WISH YOUR UNEASINESS TO BE PROLONGED
BUT SUCH OF THE COURTIERS AS ASSUMED AN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND PROFESSED A GALLANTRY OF DISPOSITION BEGAN TO APPROACH THE LADIES OF THE COURT
SUFFICIENTLY WITTY FOR THE MOST DISTINGUISHED PERSONS WHO WERE PRESENT TO BE LISTENED TO WITH PLEASURE--IT WILL EASILY BE BELIEVED THAT THE REUNIONS HELD IN MADAME'S APARTMENTS MUST NATURALLY HAVE PROVED VERY ATTRACTIVE
ONE IS TEMPTED TO INQUIRE IF SHE IS NOT THE BEAUTIFUL EUROPA WHO INSPIRED JUPITER WITH A TENDER PASSION AS SHE PLAYED WITH HER COMPANIONS IN THE FLOWER-SPANGLED MEADOWS
HAVE HER MANNERS IN ANY WAY BEEN SUCH TOWARDS YOU THAT YOU CAN ATTRIBUTE THEM TO THE JEALOUSY YOU SPEAK OF NOT AT ALL SIRE
YOU SEE YOU ARE SIGHING AGAIN
DICTATE MALICORNE CONTINUED
