I DARED NOT TELL HER FRANKLY WHAT BROUGHT ME
ALL THAT I REMEMBER IS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME I RAISED MY EYES TO THE BOX I HAD QUITTED SO ABRUPTLY AND THAT THE FACES OF FRESH VISITORS SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER ALL THE TIME
BUT THAT IS A SERIOUS FRIEND FOR WHOM YOU CARE NOTHING AS YOU HAVE SHUT YOUR DOOR AGAINST HIM AT SUCH AN HOUR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO REPROACH ME SINCE IT WAS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE YOU YOU AND YOUR FRIEND LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD DRAWN NEARER TO MARGUERITE
YOU WILL PAY MY DEBTS REALIZE YOUR ESTATE AND THEN KEEP ME
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE OF ME
THE DEVIL TAKE WEBER MUSIC AND PIANOS SHE CRIED THROWING THE MUSIC TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
MARGUERITE RESTING ONE HAND ON THE PIANO FOLLOWED EVERY NOTE ON THE MUSIC ACCOMPANYING IT IN A LOW VOICE AND WHEN GASTON HAD COME TO THE PASSAGE WHICH SHE HAD MENTIONED TO HIM SHE SANG OUT RUNNING HER FINGERS ALONG THE TOP OF THE PIANO
FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I COULD FORGET ALL THAT HAD PASSED SINCE I HAD LEFT BOUGIVAL AND I SAID TO MARGUERITE
COME HE SAID I WILL ANSWER TOMORROW WE WENT TO THE POLICE STATION AND ARMAND HANDED IN THE PERMISSION SIGNED BY MARGUERITE'S SISTER
I PASSED THROUGH THE RUE D'ANTIN WITHOUT EVEN COMING ACROSS A COMMISSIONAIRE
ARMAND WHO WAS STILL VERY WEAK TOOK OFF HIS DRESSING-GOWN AND LAY DOWN IN BED RESTING HIS HEAD FOR A FEW MOMENTS ON THE PILLOW LIKE A MAN WHO IS TIRED BY MUCH TALKING OR DISTURBED BY PAINFUL MEMORIES
YOU SEE I DO SHE ANSWERED
I WENT TO MY ROOMS TO CHANGE MY CLOTHES AND AS THE WEATHER WAS FINE AND IT WAS STILL EARLY I MADE MY WAY TO THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
MARGUERITE WAS WAITING FOR ME AT THE GARDEN GATE
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT FOR YOU
AS I SEATED MYSELF I HEARD THE DRAWING-ROOM DOOR OPEN A LIGHT FOOTSTEP MADE THE FLOOR CREAK AND THE FRONT DOOR WAS CLOSED VIOLENTLY
MEN ARE FRANTIC TO KNOW WHAT IS CERTAIN TO GIVE THEM PAIN BUT I ASSURE YOU I ADDED COLDLY AS IF WISHING TO PROVE HOW COMPLETELY I WAS CURED OF MY PASSION I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM NOT CROSS
MADAME I CONTINUED I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR HAVING FORGOTTEN THE OCCASION OF MY FIRST INTRODUCTION FOR I WAS VERY ABSURD AND MUST HAVE SEEMED TO YOU VERY TIRESOME
PEOPLE BLAME THOSE WHO LET THEMSELVES BE RUINED BY ACTRESSES AND KEPT WOMEN
THE CURTAIN WENT UP
AND WHEN I THINK HE WENT ON THAT SHE DIED BEFORE I COULD SEE HER AND THAT I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN WHEN I THINK THAT SHE DID FOR ME WHAT NO SISTER WOULD EVER HAVE DONE I CAN NOT FORGIVE MYSELF FOR HAVING LEFT HER TO DIE LIKE THAT
IT WAS NATURAL THAT I HAD NOT HEARD OF MARGUERITE'S DEATH AMONG THE PIECES OF NEWS WHICH ONE'S FRIENDS ALWAYS TELL ON RETURNING AFTER AN ABSENCE
ALL IS OVER
THE GIRL HAD NOT SEEN HER SISTER FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER FROM THE MOMENT WHEN SHE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HOME
I HEARD MEN'S VOICES AND HERS PROTESTING AGAINST THEM IN VAIN
SHE HAS COMPLETELY LOST HER VOICE AND NOW THE USE OF HER LIMBS
HOW IT WAS THAT HER ARDENT LIFE HAD LEFT ON MARGUERITE'S FACE THE VIRGINAL ALMOST CHILDLIKE EXPRESSION WHICH CHARACTERIZED IT IS A PROBLEM WHICH WE CAN BUT STATE WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE IT
I FOUND THE KEY IN THE DOOR OF MY FATHER'S ROOM
WHO SUPPLANTED ME BUT I WHO HAD SUPPLANTED M
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THIS VISIT WAS TO HAVE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON MY LIFE
PRUDENCE WANTED TO GO AND ASK YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND FOR MONEY BUT I WOULD NOT LET HER
FOR A MOMENT I HOPED THAT THE SAME ANSWER WOULD BE GIVEN TO HIM AS TO ME AND THAT I SHOULD SEE HIM COME OUT
SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES
ALL THIS WAS SET DOWN TO THE DEBAUCHERY OF A RICH OLD MAN AND EVERYTHING WAS BELIEVED EXCEPT THE TRUTH
I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH AND I AM JEALOUS OF THE LEAST OF YOUR THOUGHTS
THE MEMORY OF MARGUERITE PURSUED ME UNCEASINGLY
THIS MORNING I STAYED IN BED
SHE CAME TO THE FRONT AT ONCE LOOKED AROUND THE STALLS SAW ME AND THANKED ME WITH A LOOK
WHAT DID SHE DO LAST NIGHT SHE WENT TO THE OPERA I KNOW
AH SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
YET I HAD BEFORE ME PLENTY OF INSTANCES TO THE CONTRARY AND I HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT THE AFFECTION OF MARGUERITE WAS A THING TO BE HAD MORE OR LESS DEAR ACCORDING TO THE SEASON
LET ME STAY HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES LONGER LONG ENOUGH TO DRY MY EYES SO THAT THE IDLERS IN THE STREET MAY NOT LOOK UPON IT AS A CURIOSITY TO SEE A BIG FELLOW LIKE ME CRYING
MY DEAR ARMAND WE HAVE SERIOUS MATTERS TO DISCUSS I AM LISTENING FATHER YOU PROMISE ME TO BE FRANK AM I NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE SO IS IT NOT TRUE THAT YOU ARE LIVING WITH A WOMAN CALLED MARGUERITE GAUTIER YES DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WOMAN WAS A KEPT WOMAN AND IT IS FOR HER THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO COME AND SEE YOUR SISTER AND ME THIS YEAR YES FATHER I ADMIT IT YOU ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH THIS WOMAN YOU SEE IT FATHER SINCE SHE HAS MADE ME FAIL IN DUTY TOWARD YOU FOR WHICH I HUMBLY ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS TO-DAY MY FATHER NO DOUBT WAS NOT EXPECTING SUCH CATEGORICAL ANSWERS FOR HE SEEMED TO REFLECT A MOMENT AND THEN SAID TO ME
I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
THEREUPON HE SAID TO ME
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED
AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK
THAT IS THAT IT IS TRUE
HOW ARE YOU THIS EVENING HE SAID
SHE DID NOT APPEAR
THE HUMIDITY OF THE EARTH HAD RUSTED THE SCREWS AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT SOME DIFFICULTY THAT THE COFFIN WAS OPENED
OH MY PAST LIFE
AH SAID PRUDENCE CATCHING SIGHT OF A LITTLE SAXE FIGURE ON A SIDE-TABLE I NEVER KNEW YOU HAD THIS LITTLE GENTLEMAN WHICH A LITTLE SHEPHERD HOLDING A BIRD-CAGE TAKE IT IF YOU LIKE IT I WON'T DEPRIVE YOU OF IT I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO MY MAID
CHAPTER 25 ARMAND TIRED BY THIS LONG NARRATIVE OFTEN INTERRUPTED BY HIS TEARS PUT HIS TWO HANDS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND CLOSED HIS EYES TO THINK OR TO TRY TO SLEEP AFTER GIVING ME THE PAGES WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MARGUERITE
I WENT TO FIND A PRIEST AT SAINT ROCH I BURNED TWO CANDLES FOR HER AND I PRAYED IN THE CHURCH FOR AN HOUR
AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE THEATRE THEY WERE MET BY A FOOTMAN
PERHAPS SOME DAY WHEN YOU WERE BORED OR WORRIED YOU WOULD FANCY YOU SAW A CAREFULLY CONCERTED PLAN IN OUR LIAISON
GOOD-EVENING SHE SAID AS I ENTERED HOLDING OUT HER HAND
ARMAND
WE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING VERY WICKED BEFORE WE WERE BORN OR ELSE WE MUST BE GOING TO BE VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN WE ARE DEAD FOR GOD TO LET THIS LIFE HAVE ALL THE TORTURES OF EXPIATION AND ALL THE SORROWS OF AN ORDEAL
NOT BEING SHOCKED AT THE SIGHT OF A KEPT WOMAN'S DRESSING-ROOM I AMUSED MYSELF WITH EXAMINING EVERY DETAIL AND I DISCOVERED THAT THESE MAGNIFICENTLY CHISELLED OBJECTS BORE DIFFERENT INITIALS AND DIFFERENT CORONETS
I LOOKED UP AT MARGUERITE'S WINDOWS
ON SEEING ME SHE FLUNG HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK BUT SHE CRIED FOR A LONG TIME IN MY ARMS
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME HAD A FESTAL AIR
SHE HAD WRITTEN TO SAY SHE WAS UNWELL WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE SAID TO ME QUITE CRUDELY WITH THE HIDEOUS FRANKNESS OF CERTAIN WOMEN THAT SHE HAD TO SEE A LOVER
I WAS FULL OF INDULGENCE FOR HER LIFE FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HER BEAUTY
THE MARQUIS DE T
IN THE NAME OF YOUR LOVE AND OF YOUR REPENTANCE MARGUERITE GRANT ME THE HAPPINESS OF MY CHILD I WEPT SILENTLY MY FRIEND AT ALL THESE REFLECTIONS WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN MADE AND WHICH IN THE MOUTH OF YOUR FATHER TOOK A YET MORE SERIOUS REALITY
THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WHENEVER THEY GO OUT ARE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY SOMEBODY OR OTHER
PLATE JEWELS SHAWLS EVERYTHING IS IN PAWN
THE MORE I REFLECTED THE MORE I SAID TO MYSELF THAT MARGUERITE HAD NO REASON FOR FEIGNING A LOVE WHICH SHE DID NOT FEEL AND I SAID TO MYSELF ALSO THAT WOMEN HAVE TWO WAYS OF LOVING ONE OF WHICH MAY ARISE FROM THE OTHER
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
THEN THE TRUTH CAME BACK UPON ME AND I LET MY HEAD SINK ON MY BREAST
SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU HER BEST YEARS AND SHE WOULD BE FORGOTTEN
THE TWO WOMEN SHUT THEMSELVES INTO A BOUDOIR AND I PUT MYSELF WITHIN HEARING
DON'T IMAGINE IT IS A DUCHESS
YOU ARE ASHAMED TO ACCEPT THE PROOF OF MY LOVE
I THEN ASKED IN WHAT CEMETERY MLLE
IT WAS MY DUTY
I HELD MARGUERITE IN MY ARMS AND AS I GOT DOWN FROM THE CARRIAGE I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO LOOK UPON HER ARRANGEMENT WITH LESS CRITICAL EYES
THAT IS WHAT I CAN NOT DO
COME WHAT HE SAID TROUBLED ME
I AM GOING TO DIE O GOD
IN THE NEXT ROOM SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND SAID TO ME IN A LOW VOICE
I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST
NOW COME TO THE WINDOW WITH ME AND LET US WATCH FOR THE COUNT TO GO
A SWEET FEVER THRILLED ME
THIS LETTER IS FROM YOUR FATHER AND THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS
AFTER I HAD BEEN WALKING FOR AN HOUR FROM THE MARLY HORSES TO THE ROND-POINT I SAW MARGUERITE'S CARRIAGE IN THE DISTANCE
AND THEN AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME DO NOT SAY THAT ARMAND
FOR A MOMENT I WAS REALLY AFRAID OF FALLING IN THE STREET
GOT DOWN AND ENTERED THE HOUSE AFTER SENDING AWAY THE CARRIAGE
YOU WOULD HAVE CUT HER OFF FROM THE WORLD IN WHICH HER FORTUNE AND HER FUTURE WERE TO BE FOUND
I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WORTH AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU TAKE THE CAPRICE THAT A PRETTY GIRL HAS FOR YOU TOO SERIOUSLY
I ASKED HER THE CAUSE OF HER TROUBLE AND SHE ANSWERED
ONLY SINCE THEN SHE HAD BEEN THE MISTRESS OF ANOTHER MAN OTHER KISSES THAN MINE HAD TOUCHED HER LIPS TOWARD WHICH IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY OWN REACHED OUT AND YET I FELT THAT I LOVED THIS WOMAN AS MUCH MORE PERHAPS THAN I HAD EVER LOVED HER
I RETURNED TO BOUGIVAL
SHE LOOKED AROUND HER AS SHE GOT DOWN FROM HER COUPE AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING FOR SOME ONE
THEN I WENT UP TO HER
AT OTHER TIMES WE DID NOT GET UP ALL DAY
HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING-ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER AND HAD HAD TO RETIRE PRECIPITATELY BEFORE THE IMPERTINENT MIRTH OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE
I HASTENED TO REASSURE HIM
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THE KEPT WOMEN IN PARIS COULD LIVE IN THE STYLE THEY DO IF THEY HAD NOT THREE OR FOUR LOVERS AT ONCE
YOUR FATHER HAS A NOBLE HEART
WE ARE TALKING SENSE SAID MARGUERITE
DO YOU THINK THAT GOD HAS GIVEN SUCH A GROTESQUE AIM TO LIFE AND THAT THE HEART SHOULD HAVE ANY ROOM FOR ENTHUSIASM OF THAT KIND
WE WILL LIVE QUIETLY AND I WILL SAY GOOD-BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH
HE HAS DONE ALL HE COULD BUT THEY HAVE RETURNED TO SEIZE THE THINGS AND THE CREDITORS ARE ONLY WAITING FOR HER TO DIE IN ORDER TO SELL EVERYTHING
WHEN THIS CAMELLIA CHANGES COLOUR WHEN WILL IT CHANGE COLOUR TO-MORROW NIGHT BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE
I SENT HIM TO FETCH SOME SWEETS SO THAT WE COULD TALK BY OURSELVES FOR A MOMENT
ENOUGH JOKING I SAID TO PRUDENCE
GOD'S WILL BE DONE
SOME OF THEM WEPT WITH SINCERITY
WELL WHEN I THINK THERE ISN'T ONE OF THEM THAT SO MUCH AS BUYS HER A FLOWER NOW THAT'S QUEER SIR AND SAD
SHALL YOU GO AND SEE HER WHAT IS THE GOOD
I MADE AND REMADE TWENTY LETTERS IN MY HEAD
WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN LISTEN SHE SAID
YOU HAVE LOST I SAID
ONE EVENING WE HAD SAT AT THE WINDOW LATER THAN USUAL
MARGUERITE WAS SURE TO BE THERE
AND ONE ALWAYS WOUNDS THE SELF-ESTEEM OF A WOMAN WHEN TWO DAYS AFTER ONE HAS BECOME HER LOVER ONE LEAVES HER NO MATTER FOR WHAT REASON
SHE LOOKED AT ME FOR A FEW SECONDS PUT UP HER OPERA-GLASS TO SEE ME BETTER AND SEEMED TO THINK SHE RECOGNISED ME WITHOUT BEING QUITE SURE WHO I WAS FOR WHEN SHE PUT DOWN HER GLASSES A SMILE THAT CHARMING FEMININE SALUTATION FLITTED ACROSS HER LIPS AS IF TO ANSWER THE BOW WHICH SHE SEEMED TO EXPECT
I SAUNTERED THROUGH THE ROOMS FOLLOWING THE INQUISITIVE LADIES OF DISTINCTION
I HAD SCARCELY CLOSED THE DOOR WHEN I HEARD A THIRD PEAL OF LAUGHTER
GAUTIER'S SISTER WHAT DOES HE WANT THERE HE HAS GONE TO GET HER AUTHORITY TO HAVE THE CORPSE DUG UP AGAIN AND PUT SOMEWHERE ELSE WHY WON'T HE LET IT REMAIN HERE YOU KNOW SIR PEOPLE HAVE QUEER NOTIONS ABOUT DEAD FOLK
BECAUSE SHE WAS AT THE THEATRE WITH ME AND BECAUSE WHEN I LEAVE HERE I WANT TO HAVE SOME ONE TO SEE ME HOME COULD NOT I DO YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO AND WHY COULD YOU NOT LET ME COME UP BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU
I WAS PALE AND SAD AND THINNER THAN EVER
A CAB WAS WAITING AT THE GATE
IT IS PERHAPS THE THIRST OF THE FEVER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT'S DREAM A MOMENT'S DELIRIUM
WE HAD NOT EXCHANGED A WORD SINCE LEAVING THE HOUSE
I WAS EXHAUSTED BY THIS SERIES OF SHOCKS
YOU ARE TWENTY-FOUR
IT WAS NOTICED BOTH BY HER FRIENDS AND BY THE HABITUE'S OF THE THEATRES TO WHICH SHE MOST OFTEN WENT
HE HAD SEEN NO ONE SINCE I WENT OUT
CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY
I ENTERED WITHOUT BEING ANNOUNCED AND FOUND PRUDENCE AT HER TOILET
A COLD SWEAT BROKE OUT ON MY FOREHEAD FOR I ALREADY LOVED THIS WOMAN TOO MUCH NOT TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE SUSPICION
THEN I BEGAN TO FEAR LEST MARGUERITE HAD NO MORE THAN A FEW DAYS CAPRICE FOR ME AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT SINCE WE SHOULD SOON HAVE TO PART IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT BUT TO WRITE AND TELL HER MY FEARS AND LEAVE HER
AH
AH
YOU ARE AN ORDINARY LOVER
SO UNABLE TO REMAIN WITHIN DOORS AND NOT DARING TO CALL ON MARGUERITE I MADE ONE ATTEMPT IN HER DIRECTION AN ATTEMPT THAT I COULD ALWAYS LOOK UPON AS A MERE CHANCE IF IT SUCCEEDED
MARGUERITE AND I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY IN TALKING OVER OUR PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE AS IF WE FELT THE NEED OF REALIZING THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
HE RECEIVED IN RETURN A LETTER TO THE KEEPER OF THE CEMETERY AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT THE DISINTERMENT WAS TO TAKE PLACE NEXT DAY AT TEN O'CLOCK THAT I SHOULD CALL FOR HIM AN HOUR BEFORE AND THAT WE SHOULD GO TO THE CEMETERY TOGETHER
YOU KNOW HOW I INSISTED ON YOUR RETURNING TO PARIS NEXT DAY
WELL BE HAPPY
WHEN JOSEPH CAME TO TELL YOU OF YOUR FATHER'S ARRIVAL I TREMBLED AS IF HE HAD BROUGHT NEWS OF SOME MISFORTUNE
FROM TIME TO TIME MY HEART LEAPED WITH LOVE AND JOY IN MY BREAST
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SUPPER WITH ME SHE SAID TO ME
OVER AGAIN GASTON BEGAN OVER AGAIN AFTER WHICH MARGUERITE SAID
WE WENT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND FROM THAT TO THE BOUDOIR WHICH WAS THEN JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT SINCE
I RECEIVED IT AT TOULON
THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES WAS FULL OF PEOPLE
YOU ARE INDEPENDENT I AM FREE WE ARE YOUNG
DUVAL HAD INTRUSTED TO HIM
WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK
I ONLY KNEW THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING CONNECTED WITH MARGUERITE
SIT DOWN BUT I AM TAKING SOME ONE'S PLACE
ARMAND WAS FLUSHED AND DELIRIOUS
IT WILL MAKE HER VERY HAPPY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO MEET M
TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE
I TRIED TO PUT IN PRACTICE THE THEORIES OF PRUDENCE AND TO BE AS GAY AS MY TWO COMPANIONS
I WAS AWAKENED BY A LETTER FROM MARGUERITE CONTAINING THESE WORDS
I SHALL GO TO BED EARLY TO-NIGHT AND SHALL NOT SEE YOU
AS LONG AS SHE REMAINED AT BAGNERES THE PROMISE SHE HAD MADE TO THE DUKE HAD NOT BEEN HARD TO KEEP AND SHE HAD KEPT IT
I TOOK TWO HOURS TO REACH THE BARRIERE DE L'ETOILE
NEVERTHELESS FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AFTER A VISIT TO BAGNEES SHE WAS SAID TO BE LIVING WITH AN OLD DUKE A FOREIGNER ENORMOUSLY RICH WHO HAD TRIED TO REMOVE HER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM HER FORMER LIFE AND AS IT SEEMED ENTIRELY TO HER OWN SATISFACTION
NOT WELL REPLIED MARGUERITE DRILY
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND TO HAVE NOTHING TO REPROACH ME FOR THAT IS ALL AND WE ARE GOING TO BE SEPARATED WHY MARGUERITE WHO CAN SEPARATE US I CRIED
COME COME SAID PRUDENCE WHO HAD TAKEN OFF HER HAT AND WAS SMOOTHING HER HAIR BEFORE THE GLASS YOU WILL WORK YOURSELF INTO A RAGE AND DO YOURSELF HARM
ALL THE YOUNG MEN OF TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AT PARIS THAT IS TO SAY MEN WHO HAVE ONLY JUST ENOUGH TO LIVE ON IN THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY MIX KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHEN THEY ARE THE LOVERS OF A WOMAN LIKE MARGUERITE THAT SHE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS PAY FOR THE ROOMS SHE LIVES IN AND THE SERVANTS WHO WAIT UPON HER WITH WHAT THEY GIVE HER
I THANKED THE GARDENER AGAIN PUTTING A FEW COINS INTO HIS HAND AND MADE MY WAY TO THE ADDRESS HE HAD GIVEN ME
AT EVERY GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE HER CHEEKS WOULD FLUSH WITH A FEVERISH COLOUR AND A COUGH HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE AT THE BEGINNING OF SUPPER BECAME AT LAST SO VIOLENT THAT SHE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAN HER HEAD ON THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND HOLD HER CHEST IN HER HANDS EVERY TIME THAT SHE COUGHED
THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT
EVIDENTLY I WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MIRTH AND MY EMBARRASSMENT INCREASED
CHAPTER 17 NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
ONLY SHE SEEMED TO SUFFER FOR WHENEVER I MET HER SHE WAS MORE AND MORE PALE MORE AND MORE SAD
AS FOR ME I ONLY KNOW THAT I WAS FATED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MARGUERITE AND THAT I FORESAW IT
WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THOSE TEARS THIS ABSENCE THIS MYSTERY
I HAD TO LOVE OR TO HATE HER
BUT VEILED THOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO YEARS EARLIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED TO SEE HER IN ORDER TO RECOGNISE HER
MARGUERITE WHO HAD REMEMBERED MY FACE FOR A MOMENT DID NOT REMEMBER MY NAME
I DREW THOSE OF THE DINING-ROOM AND WENT TOWARD THE BED-ROOM AND PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR
ALL THAT IT SEEMS TO ME IS QUITE NATURAL
THAT THEN I CONTINUED IS WHY SHE IS ALONE HERE PRECISELY BUT WHO WILL SEE HER HOME HE WILL HE WILL COME FOR HER IN A MOMENT AND YOU WHO IS SEEING YOU HOME NO ONE MAY I OFFER MYSELF BUT YOU ARE WITH A FRIEND ARE YOU NOT MAY WE OFFER THEN WHO IS YOUR FRIEND A CHARMING FELLOW VERY AMUSING
ON THE CONTRARY YOU PERSIST IN ONLY SEEING IN ME A WOMAN TO WHOM LUXURY IS INDISPENSABLE AND WHOM YOU THINK YOU ARE ALWAYS OBLIGED TO PAY
MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WHAT A NICE PLACE YOU'VE GOT PRUDENCE WENT ON
IN THE PASSAGE I MET THE COUNT COMING BACK
IT WAS NO DOUBT A MERE CHANCE BUT THE CHANCE FILLED ME WITH DELIGHT
YOUR YOUTH WOULD BE LOST MY SON'S FUTURE DESTROYED
IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME MARGUERITE ARRIVED
I REPEAT THEN THAT THE BOOK IS YOURS AND ONCE MORE I BEG YOU TO ACCEPT IT
GOING OUT HAS DONE ME GOOD
CHAPTER 15 IT WAS HARDLY AN HOUR AFTER JOSEPH AND I HAD BEGUN PREPARING FOR MY DEPARTURE WHEN THERE WAS A VIOLENT RING AT THE DOOR
GAUTIER ONLY BY SIGHT I SAID
BY THE SIDE OF THAT IDEAL LIFE THERE IS A MATERIAL LIFE AND THE PUREST RESOLUTIONS ARE HELD TO EARTH BY THREADS WHICH SEEM SLIGHT ENOUGH BUT WHICH ARE OF IRON NOT EASILY TO BE BROKEN
HESITATED OVER A PIECE OF FURNITURE THE PRICE OF WHICH WAS BEING RUN HIGH BY MME
I WAS ALMOST GLAD AT HEARING IT
I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART
THERE IS NO ONE BY ME
I FELL ON MY KNEES
I HAD A BAD DREAM AND AM NOT YET FULLY AWAKE FROM THAT MOMENT MARGUERITE TRIED TO SEEM MORE CHEERFUL
I WENT TO HER KNELT DOWN TOOK HER TWO HANDS AND DEEPLY MOVED SAID TO HER PARDON SHE KISSED ME ON THE FOREHEAD AND SAID
PRUDENCE NOW CAME BUT RARELY
IMAGINE THAT MARGUERITE IS MARRIED AND DECEIVE THE HUSBAND
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE STRONGER THAN MY WILL
TWO HOURS AFTERWARD I WAS STILL SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED LOOKING AT THE PILLOW WHICH KEPT THE IMPRINT OF HER FORM AND ASKING MYSELF WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF ME BETWEEN MY LOVE AND MY JEALOUSY
AN OLD PAL OF HERS I SUPPOSE FOR THEY SAY SHE WAS A GAY ONE
IT IS I WHO WILL MAKE HIM BELIEVE ME
THIS FRANKNESS WHICH WAS ALMOST A KIND OF CONFESSION THE SAD LIFE OF WHICH I CAUGHT SOME GLIMPSE THROUGH THE GOLDEN VEIL WHICH COVERED IT AND WHOSE REALITY THE POOR GIRL SOUGHT TO ESCAPE IN DISSIPATION DRINK AND WAKEFULNESS IMPRESSED ME SO DEEPLY THAT I COULD NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD
NOW MARGUERITE ENDED WITH ME SO LIGHTLY THAT I REALIZE I WAS A GREAT FOOL TO HAVE BEEN AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER AS I WAS FOR I WAS REALLY VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL YOU CAN IMAGINE THE WAY IN WHICH I SAID THAT
SINCE SHE MUST DIE IT IS BETTER TO LET EVERYTHING GO THAN TO SAVE IT FOR HER FAMILY WHOM SHE HAS NEVER CARED TO SEE AND WHO HAVE NEVER CARED FOR HER
IT WAS JEALOUSY CERTAINLY BUT IRONICAL AND IMPERTINENT JEALOUSY
AND THEY HAVE INVENTED THE WORD CAPRICE FOR THAT UNBARTERED LOVE WHICH THEY ALLOW THEMSELVES FROM TIME TO TIME FOR A REST FOR AN EXCUSE FOR A CONSOLATION LIKE USURERS WHO CHEAT A THOUSAND AND THINK THEY HAVE BOUGHT THEIR OWN REDEMPTION BY ONCE LENDING A SOVEREIGN TO A POOR DEVIL WHO IS DYING OF HUNGER WITHOUT ASKING FOR INTEREST OR A RECEIPT
MARGUERITE SPENDS MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
ON BEING QUESTIONED MARGUERITE ADMITTED EVERYTHING TO THE DUKE AND ADVISED HIM WITHOUT ARRIERE-PENSEE TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH HER NO LONGER FOR SHE FELT INCAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT WHAT SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN AND SHE DID NOT WISH TO GO ON ACCEPTING BENEFITS FROM A MAN WHOM SHE WAS DECEIVING
ONE OF THE SHOPMEN STOOD AT THE DOOR LOOKING AFTER HIS ELEGANT CUSTOMER'S CARRIAGE
DID YOU TELL HER SO YES AND DID SHE PROMISE TO BELIEVE YOU NO SHE IS NOT LIKE PRUDENCE DID SHE PROMISE TO BETTER STILL MY DEAR FELLOW
BUT I WOULD HEAR OF NOTHING CONVINCED AS I WAS THAT I SHOULD LOSE IN A PERHAPS FRUITLESS INQUIRY MORE TIME THAN I SHOULD TAKE TO COVER HALF THE ROAD
WAS IT THROUGH FORCE OF HABIT OR WAS IT TO REMIND ME OF THE DAY WHEN WE FIRST MET
YOU HAVE BEEN MORE REASONABLE THAN SHE FOR SHE WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU
WE HAVE WOMEN WHO CALL THEMSELVES OUR FRIENDS BUT THEY ARE FRIENDS LIKE PRUDENCE WOMEN WHO WERE ONCE KEPT AND WHO HAVE STILL THE COSTLY TASTES THAT THEIR AGE DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO GRATIFY
I WAS IN A FEVER
DID I DO RIGHT
TWO BIG TEARS ROLLED DOWN THE CHEEKS OF THE SICK MAN AND HE TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD TO HIDE THEM FROM ME
THEN THE MOMENT IS COME WHEN YOU MUST LIVE OTHERWISE WHY FATHER BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING THINGS WHICH OUTRAGE THE RESPECT THAT YOU IMAGINE YOU HAVE FOR YOUR FAMILY I DON'T FOLLOW YOUR MEANING I WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE
I FOR MY PART FIND A CONTINUAL SOLACE IN IT
I VISITED EVERY ROOM
THE STABLES WERE NOT AT THE HOUSE
HAD SHE COUNTED ON BEING BACK IN TIME FOR ME NOT TO PERCEIVE HER ABSENCE AND HAD SHE BEEN DETAINED BY CHANCE
I SIGHED FROM TIME TO TIME AT WHICH PRUDENCE TURNED AND SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS LIKE A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS GIVEN UP HIS PATIENT
WELL MY DAUGHTER IS ABOUT TO MARRY
R WHO MAKES BY HER MERE TALENT TWICE WHAT THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD MAKE BY THEIR DOT AND THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS MAKE BY THEIR AMOURS HAD COME IN SPITE OF THE COLD TO MAKE SOME PURCHASES AND WAS NOT THE LEAST LOOKED AT AMONG THE CROWD
I COULD SCARCELY RECOGNISE HER FACE THROUGH THE VEIL
WE OFTEN WENT AT NIGHT-TIME TO SIT IN THE LITTLE WOOD ABOVE THE HOUSE
HERE WE ARE I SAW BEFORE ME A SQUARE OF FLOWERS WHICH ONE WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN FOR A GRAVE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A WHITE MARBLE SLAB BEARING A NAME
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOME SELFISHNESS IN THIS INTEREST
SHE HAD BROKEN EQUALLY WITH HER FRIENDS AND WITH HER WAYS WITH HER WORDS AND WITH HER EXTRAVAGANCES
YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND WHICH I KISSED
HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
I FEARED TO DISCOVER THAT MARGUERITE WAS NOT WORTHY OF THE SENTIMENT WHICH I FELT FOR HER
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME
SHUT YOUR EYES NOW
WAS AT LONDON
SHE LITTLE KNOWS HOW FAR I AM FROM SUCH THINGS NOW
TEARS OF GRATITUDE AND LOVE FILLED MY EYES AND I FLUNG MYSELF INTO MARGUERITE'S ARMS
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN YOU KNOW HOW IT CUTS SHORT THE DAYS AND WITH WHAT LOVING LISTLESSNESS ONE DRIFTS INTO THE MORROW
WINTER IS AT HAND
THE DUKE DID NOT RETURN FOR A WEEK
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT A GIRL LIKE MARGUERITE HAD PROMISED HERSELF TO A MAN ON THE MORROW OF THE DAY ON WHICH HE HAD ASKED FOR THE PROMISE
AND EVEN ALL NIGHT AS LONG AS I DID NOT WEARY YOU AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT DEVOTION AND WHAT DOES THIS DEVOTION COME FROM THE IRRESISTIBLE SYMPATHY WHICH I HAVE FOR YOU SO YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME
BUT TO MAKE UP I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO-MORROW AT TWELVE
I MADE UP MY MIND TO ENDURE IT NO LONGER AND TO SET OUT NEXT DAY
PRUDENCE IS GIVING HER NEW YEAR'S PRESENTS WITH THOSE I HAVE RECEIVED
SHE PRESSED MY HAND WITHOUT A WORD FOR TEARS STILL VEILED HER VOICE
THE DEALERS WHO HAD FILLED THE BENCHES IN FRONT OF THE AUCTION TABLE TRIED IN VAIN TO OBTAIN SILENCE IN ORDER TO TRANSACT THEIR BUSINESS IN PEACE
ON THE FIRST PAGE WAS WRITTEN IN INK IN AN ELEGANT HAND AN INSCRIPTION ON THE PART OF THE GIVER
SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES
MARGUERITE WAS A PRETTY WOMAN
AFTER ALL NO ONE IS UNHAPPY ALWAYS
FAR FROM PARIS FAR FAR THEY TELL ME AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN MARGUERITE
BUT WHAT YOU CAN NOT KNOW WHAT YOU CAN NOT SUSPECT IS WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED SINCE OUR SEPARATION
HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
I TOLD HIM OF OUR HAPPINESS OF HOW YOU HAD SHOWN ME THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUIETER AND HAPPIER LIFE AND HE ENDED BY GIVING IN TO THE EVIDENCE OFFERING ME HIS HAND AND ASKING PARDON FOR THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD AT FIRST APPROACHED ME
A NICE FELLOW WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE SUPPER WITH HIM AND ONE OF HIS FRIENDS WHO HE SAID WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO MAKE MY ACQUAINTANCE
SHE IS WAITING TO SEE IF I SHALL TAKE SOME FRESH STEP AND IF I RETRACT MY LETTER OF TO-DAY I SAID TO MYSELF AS I WENT TO BED
IS IT ALL OVER BETWEEN US FOREVER
SHE HAS TAKEN TO HER BED
I HAVE A FINE STRAPPING GIRL MYSELF
YOUR FATHER WILL ACCUSE ME OF HINDERING YOU AGAIN FROM GOING TO SEE HIM WHEN HE WANTS TO SEE YOU
ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAD SO OFTEN WITNESSED CAME BACK TO MY MEMORY AND I REGRETTED HER DEATH AS ONE MIGHT REGRET THE DESTRUCTION OF A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART
I GAVE HIM MARGUERITE'S LETTER AND FALLING ON MY KNEES BESIDE HIS BED I WEPT HOT TEARS
AND IS ALWAYS IN THE WAY
WELL TO RETURN TO YOU
IS A MISFORTUNE FOR ME AT LAST THE COUNT CAME OUT GOT INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND DISAPPEARED
I TOOK THE KEY OF THE FLAT IN THE RUE D'ANTIN AND AFTER SAYING GOOD-BYE TO NANINE WHO CAME WITH ME AS FAR AS THE GATE I SET OUT
HERE YOU HAVE IT
I WENT TO MY OWN ROOMS HOPING THAT HE HAD PERHAPS GONE THERE
CLARET IS BETTER FOR YOU
UNFORTUNATELY EVIL PASSION HAD THE UPPER HAND AND I ONLY SOUGHT FOR SOME MEANS OF AVENGING MYSELF ON THE POOR CREATURE
IT IS CURIOUS ONE MUST ADMIT
YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU WERE BOUND TO DO
THE REPORT OF MY NEW INFATUATION WAS IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ABROAD
I WAS IN NEED OF IT
I WAS IN BED FOR TWO MONTHS AND AFTER THREE WEEKS NO ONE CAME TO SEE ME IT IS TRUE I AM NOTHING TO YOU I WENT ON BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME I WILL LOOK AFTER YOU LIKE A BROTHER I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE AND I WILL CURE YOU
I INTENDED TO COME QUITE SLOWLY AND I HAD COME IN FIVE MINUTES FROM THE RUE DE PROVENCE TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
THE SECOND INTERPRETATION SEEMED THE MORE PROBABLE FOR THE FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IMPERTINENT PIECE OF PLAIN SPEAKING WHICH MARGUERITE WHATEVER HER OPINION OF HERSELF WOULD NEVER HAVE ACCEPTED
WITH A DISINTERESTED LOVE YES
NOW I WAS IN LOVE WITH MARGUERITE
LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
IT WAS AN ECONOMY TO SELL THEM
YOU PITY THE BLIND MAN WHO HAS NEVER SEEN THE DAYLIGHT THE DEAF WHO HAS NEVER HEARD THE HARMONIES OF NATURE THE DUMB WHO HAS NEVER FOUND A VOICE FOR HIS SOUL AND UNDER A FALSE CLOAK OF SHAME YOU WILL NOT PITY THIS BLINDNESS OF HEART THIS DEAFNESS OF SOUL THIS DUMBNESS OF CONSCIENCE WHICH SETS THE POOR AFFLICTED CREATURE BESIDE HERSELF AND MAKES HER IN SPITE OF HERSELF INCAPABLE OF SEEING WHAT IS GOOD OF BEARING THE LORD AND OF SPEAKING THE PURE LANGUAGE OF LOVE AND FAITH
THERE ARE MEN WHO RUIN THEMSELVES WITHOUT OBTAINING THE LEAST THING FROM US
WHEN HE RETURNED I WENT UP TO HIM
THE STORY OF MARGUERITE IS AN EXCEPTION I REPEAT
EVIL IS NOTHING BUT VANITY LET US HAVE THE PRIDE OF GOOD AND ABOVE ALL LET US NEVER DESPAIR
DUVERNOY REPEATED EVERYWHERE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR HER MONEY DIFFICULTIES SHE EXTRACTED A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS FROM ARMAND WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IT BUT WHO PRETENDED TO OUT OF RESPECT FOR ALL THOSE IN WHOSE COMPANY MARGUERITE HAD LIVED
LET US THEN FORGET YOU A NAME WHICH MUST BE INDIFFERENT ENOUGH TO YOU I A HAPPINESS WHICH HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE
IT IS NO GOOD AT THE END OF TWO YEARS TO MAKE LOVE TO A WOMAN LIKE ME
MARGUERITE COULD NOT FINISH THE WHOLE BUSINESS TO-DAY AND WAS STAYING THE NIGHT WITH PRUDENCE OR PERHAPS SHE WOULD COME EVEN NOW FOR SHE MUST KNOW BOW ANXIOUS I SHOULD BE AND WOULD NOT WISH TO LEAVE ME IN THAT CONDITION
BUT ON THE CONTRARY SHE OUGHT TO BE ENCHANTED AT THIS SEPARATION
I JOINED HIM IN LONDON
MARGUERITE GAUTIER I AM FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN DEBT I HAVE NOT A PENNY OF MY OWN AND I SPEND A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
FINALLY MY DEAR CHILD LET ME TELL YOU ALL FOR I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU ALL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAS BROUGHT ME TO PARIS
WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO
BEHIND THIS LITTLE HOUSE WAS A CHARMING GARDEN SURROUNDED BY WALLS HIGH ENOUGH TO SCREEN US FROM OUR NEIGHBOURS AND LOW ENOUGH NOT TO SHUT OFF OUR OWN VIEW
THE WORDS OF IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CURE ME IF ANYTHING COULD CURE ME
HERE IS THE PRICE OF YOUR NIGHT THEN WHEN THE LETTER WAS SENT I WENT OUT AS IF TO FREE MYSELF FROM THE INSTANTANEOUS REMORSE OF THIS INFAMOUS ACTION
I ROLLED THE ARM-CHAIR IN WHICH SHE WAS SITTING UP TO THE FIRE
BESIDES I FELT THE NEED OF AIR AND PHYSICAL FATIGUE IN ORDER TO COOL DOWN THE OVER-EXCITEMENT WHICH POSSESSED ME
IT WAS A BLOW TO THE OLD MAN FOR THE RESEMBLANCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER WAS ENDED IN ONE DIRECTION BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
LET HER COME TO SEE ME BUT FOR MY PART I WILL NEVER PUT FOOT IN THE RUE D'ANTIN WILL YOU RECEIVE HER WELL CERTAINLY WELL I AM SURE THAT SHE WILL COME LET HER COME SHALL YOU BE OUT TO-DAY I SHALL BE AT HOME ALL THE EVENING I WILL TELL HER AND PRUDENCE LEFT ME
IN A BOOK OF ALPHONSE KARR ENTITLES AM RAUCHEN THERE IS A MAN WHO ONE EVENING FOLLOWS A VERY ELEGANT WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH AT FIRST SIGHT ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
SIR I SAID CAN YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO FORMERLY LIVED HERE MADEMOISELLE MARGUERITE GAUTIER I KNEW HER BY NAME AND BY SIGHT
THERE WERE TWO LETTERS ADDRESSED TO DUVAL
HOW IS IT THAT PRUDENCE DOES NOT SEND YOU BACK YOUR CARRIAGE I ASKED ONE DAY
GOOD-BYE ARMAND MME
HAVE YOU SEEN PRUDENCE NO YOU WERE A LONG TIME IN PARIS I FOUND LETTERS FROM MY FATHER TO WHICH I HAD TO REPLY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD NANINE ENTERED ALL OUT OF BREATH
SHE KNOWS HOW ANXIOUS I AM AND I AM SURE SHE IS GOING ABOUT ON HER OWN ACCOUNT WITHOUT GIVING A THOUGHT TO ME PERHAPS SHE HAD TO WAIT LET US HAVE SOME PUNCH IT WILL DO YOU NO GOOD MADAME SAID NANINE
SHE COULD NOT DOUBT MY LOVE WHICH INCREASED DAY BY DAY AND YET I OFTEN FOUND HER SAD WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET ANY EXPLANATION OF THE REASON EXCEPT SOME PHYSICAL CAUSE
I WANTED TO SEE YOU ONLY NOT AN ENEMY AND I WANTED TO TAKE YOUR HAND ONCE MORE
YOU SEE THAT INDUCES THEM TO BUY SHE WAS IN DEBT THEN TO ANY EXTENT SIR BUT THE SALE WILL COVER IT AND MORE TOO WHO WILL GET WHAT REMAINS OVER HER FAMILY SHE HAD A FAMILY IT SEEMS SO THANKS THE ATTENDANT REASSURED AS TO MY INTENTIONS TOUCHED HIS HAT AND I WENT OUT
I DO NOT KNOW HOW I CAN EVER EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO YOU BY GIVING ME A LITTLE OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP SAID I AND BY TELLING ME THE CAUSE OF YOUR SUFFERING
A PAINFUL ODOUR AROSE IN SPITE OF THE AROMATIC PLANTS WITH WHICH IT WAS COVERED
WHEN CAN HE FIND YOU ALONE
HE CAME TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT
I WAS AFRAID HE WOULD SAY YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT WHEN I DECLARED THAT THIS WOMAN DID NOT LOVE YOU BUT HE DID NOT USE HIS ADVANTAGE AND WE REACHED C
THE DUKE WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE IN ORDER THAT MARGUERITE MIGHT REST THERE NO LONGER VISITED IT FEARING TO FIND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A LARGE AND MERRY COMPANY BY WHOM HE DID NOT WISH TO BE SEEN
SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
WHY ARE YOU NOT IN PARIS ARMAND
AND WHAT PROVES THAT HE ACCEPTED MY SACRIFICE IS THAT HE GAVE ME THE STRENGTH FOR WHICH I PRAYED
HOW YOU RECEIVE ME
YOU LOVE ME AS IF I HAD NEVER BELONGED TO ANOTHER AND I TREMBLE LEST LATER ON REPENTING OF YOUR LOVE AND ACCUSING ME OF MY PAST YOU SHOULD LET ME FALL BACK INTO THAT LIFE FROM WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN ME
I RECOVERED MY BREATH AND WENT ON
SHALL YOU GO AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO MARGUERITE SHE CONTINUED AS SERIOUSLY AS BEFORE
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED YES
THEREUPON JOSEPH ENTERED
I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON-FLY
I IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD STOPPED HER CARRIAGE IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY SHE HAD DONE SO AND I HOPED THAT AT THE SAME TIME SHE HAD FOUND SOME NEW PRETEXT FOR NOT RECEIVING HIM ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT
I SAW IN HER INSTINCTS WHICH WERE LACKING IN THE OTHER AND AT THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH I MADE MY BARGAIN I FELT A DISGUST TOWARD THE WOMAN WITH WHOM I WAS MAKING IT
JULIE WHO SLEPT IN MY ROOM RAN INTO THE DINING-ROOM
POOR DEAR MARGUERITE I WISH I WERE A HOLY WOMAN THAT MY KISS MIGHT RECOMMEND YOU TO GOD
WHAT COULD BE MORE NATURAL
LET US GO HE ANSWERED MECHANICALLY BUT WITHOUT MOVING A STEP
SHE WORE A MUSLIN DRESS WITH MANY FLOUNCES AN INDIAN SHAWL EMBROIDERED AT THE CORNERS WITH GOLD AND SILK FLOWERS A STRAW HAT A SINGLE BRACELET AND A HEAVY GOLD CHAIN SUCH AS WAS JUST THEN BEGINNING TO BE THE FASHION
AT THE VOICE OF PRUDENCE MARGUERITE ROSE AND COMING TOWARD US WITH A LOOK OF GRATITUDE TO MME
ONLY I DID NOT RETURN HOME
THEY ARE LAYING THE TABLE AND WE'LL HAVE SUPPER WHEN I ENTERED MARGUERITE RAN TO ME THREW HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND KISSED ME WITH ALL HER MIGHT
SHE WAS STILL SUFFERING
I LIVED AT THAT TIME IN THE RUE DE PROVENCE
I DID NOT TELL MARGUERITE WHAT I HAD DONE CERTAIN AS I WAS THAT SHE WOULD REFUSE THE GIFT
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN WHOM DEATH HAS FORGOTTEN MAKES ME DIE FASTER
THE WEATHER WAS SUPERB
YOU ARE REALLY VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER HE ASKED
MARGUERITE GAUTIER HE SAID
THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO MYSELF ALL NIGHT LONG AND WHAT I WAS EVERY MOMENT PREPARED TO GO AND SAY TO MARGUERITE
I TOO SHOULD BE GLAD OF THIS SOLITUDE A DEUX AND NOT ONLY GLAD OF IT BUT MY HEALTH REQUIRES IT
YOU ARE COLD
THE STREETS WERE EMPTY THE GREAT CITY WAS STILL ASLEEP A SWEET FRESHNESS CIRCULATED IN THE STREETS THAT A FEW HOURS LATER WOULD BE FILLED WITH THE NOISE OF MEN
A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE EVENTS WHICH I HAVE JUST RELATED ARMAND WAS CONVALESCENT AND WE HAD ALREADY BECOME GREAT FRIENDS
LEAVE US ALONE
THEY ARE SUNS WHICH SET AS THEY ROSE UNOBSERVED
HER HEAD A MARVEL WAS THE OBJECT OF THE MOST COQUETTISH CARE
I LOVED ALL THE PEOPLE WHOM I MET
ARE YOU SURE YOU WHO HAVE LOVED HIM THAT YOU WILL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER
WHEN YOU COME BACK WE WILL GO TOGETHER TO THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE AND ARRANGE FOR TO-MORROW'S CEREMONY ARMAND HANDED ME HIS PASSPORT AND I WENT TO RUE JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU
HE WAS AS WHITE AS THE CORPSE WHICH WE HAD JUST SEEN
AT TWELVE I WAS ON THE POINT OF KEEPING THE APPOINTMENT AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
THE FUTURE OF A CHILD WHO HAS DONE NOTHING AGAINST YOU AND WHO HAS THE RIGHT OF LOOKING FORWARD TO A HAPPY FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS
MARGUERITE HERSELF WHETHER SHE GUESSED MY MOTIVE OR WAS DECEIVED LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE PRESERVED A PERFECT DIGNITY IN RESPONSE TO THE INSULTS WHICH I HEAPED UPON HER DAILY
I COUGHED AND SPAT BLOOD ALL THE NIGHT
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THIS STORY RETURNED TO MY MIND WHILE I LOOKED AT THE SILVER TOILET THINGS AND A CERTAIN SPACE OF TIME MUST HAVE ELAPSED DURING THESE REFLECTIONS FOR NO ONE WAS LEFT IN THE ROOM BUT MYSELF AND AN ATTENDANT WHO STANDING NEAR THE DOOR WAS CAREFULLY WATCHING ME TO SEE THAT I DID NOT POCKET ANYTHING
BUT THE HOPE OF A SPEEDY RETURN AND THE FEAR OF OFFENDING MY FATHER STILL MORE SUSTAINED ME AND I TOOK MY PLACE IN THE TRAIN
I WAITED FOR HER IMPATIENTLY THAT I MIGHT SAY TO HER AS I COVERED HER WITH KISSES THAT I HAD GUESSED THE REASON OF HER MYSTERIOUS ABSENCE
BUT SEEING ME AGAIN IN PARIS FINDING HERSELF FACE TO FACE WITH ME PALE AS I WAS SHE MUST HAVE REALIZED THAT I HAD NOT RETURNED WITHOUT PURPOSE AND SHE MUST HAVE ASKED HERSELF WHAT THAT PURPOSE WAS
FEBRUARY 22
IN SPITE OF YOURSELF YOU THINK OF LEAVING ME SOME DAY AND YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND RISK OF SUSPICION
ADIEU MY DEAR COUNT
THAT IS ALL
GAUTIER HAD BEEN BURIED
HE KNEW AS LITTLE ABOUT IT AS I
I NEVER SAW HER AS SHE WAS TO-DAY AND I AM AFRAID SHE IS GOING TO BE ILL I AM DINING IN TOWN REPLIED PRUDENCE AND I CAN'T GO AND SEE MARGUERITE THIS EVENING
YES I ANSWERED MECHANICALLY
AT THE SOUND ARMAND RECOILED AS AT AN ELECTRIC SHOCK AND SEIZED MY HAND WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO GIVE ME PAIN
GOOD-BYE
ONLY I AM NOT WELL
YOU REMEMBER THE INVOLUNTARY FRIGHT THAT HIS ARRIVAL CAUSED ME AND THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE BETWEEN YOU AND HIM WHICH YOU TOLD ME OF IN THE EVENING
I WAS FORCED FROM TIME TO TIME TO REREAD MARGUERITE'S LETTER IN ORDER TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING
DO RE MI DO RE FA MI RE
SHE HAD SATIN SLIPPERS ON HER BARE FEET AND WAS IN THE ACT OF POLISHING HER NAILS
HE WILL HAVE SEEN HER DIE TWICE
EVERY DAY ONE DISCOVERS IN ONE'S MISTRESS A NEW CHARM AND UNKNOWN DELIGHTS
I MUST HAVE LOOKED GREATLY AGITATED FOR SHE ADDED
MARGUERITE WANTED TO KEEP IT
DUVAL HAS GONE TO SEE MLLE
ARMAND CONTINUED MY FATHER IN THE NAME OF YOUR SAINTED MOTHER ABANDON THIS LIFE WHICH YOU WILL FORGET MORE EASILY THAN YOU THINK
THERE'S NO MORE OF HER LEFT THAN OF THEM THAT NO ONE HAS A WORD TO SAY AGAINST
SINCE THE DAY THAT MARGUERITE INSISTED ON GOING TO THE THEATRE SHE HAS GOT WORSE AND WORSE
DE N M
THE RASCAL OF AN AGENT TO WHOM SHE HAD OFFERED TO SELL HER FURNITURE WENT AROUND TO HER CREDITORS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH SHE OWED
I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK
WE CAN NOT THEN HAVE OR RATHER I CAN NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE POSSIBLE KIND OF HAPPINESS AND THIS IS SAD AS I SOMETIMES AM SUFFERING AS I ALWAYS AM TO FIND A MAN SUPERIOR ENOUGH NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT MY LIFE AND TO BE THE LOVER OF MY IMPRESSIONS RATHER THAN OF MY BODY
I ALREADY REALIZED THAT I SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED WHATEVER REASONS SHE HAD GIVEN ME AND ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN NOT TO SEE HER AGAIN
BUT THAT DAY MME
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WOULD DO THEN
WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED
MAKE THE MOST OF IT BUT ASK NOTHING MORE WHEN SHE HAD GONE I WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE SOLITUDE IN WHICH SHE LEFT ME
THERE WERE FOUR
I MIGHT HAVE SAID TO YOU I WANT TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS
THE SALE WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF THE OWNER
MARGUERITE HAD STILL PRIDE AND INDEPENDENCE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH IF THEY ARE WOUNDED CAN BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A SENSE OF SHAME
OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE
THEY HAVE SCARCELY BEGUN TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER WHEN IT SEEMS AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN ONE ANOTHER ALWAYS AND ALL THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IS WIPED OUT FROM THE MEMORY OF THE TWO LOVERS
ONCE THERE WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE
WHO IS SHE WHAT WAS SHE LIKE BLONDE SLENDER WITH SIDE CURLS
THE POOR GIRL WON'T LAST LONG I REMEMBER THE WORDS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SPOKEN TO ME YESTERDAY
BUT THAT TIME WAS SO FAR AWAY THAT IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN EFFACED FROM MY MEMORY AND IF I HAD ANY FEAR IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT OF MARGUERITE BEING UNFAITHFUL TO ME
THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF
I GIVE YOU MY CONGRATULATIONS MY DEAR FELLOW
I CALLED OUT MY NAME TO THE PORTER WHO HAD HAD FROM ME ENOUGH TWENTY-FRANC PIECES TO KNOW THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO CALL ON MLLE
SHE TURNS HER EYES TOWARD ME BUT SHE NO LONGER SEES ME
I DO NOT DRAW FROM THIS STORY THE CONCLUSION THAT ALL WOMEN LIKE MARGUERITE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING ALL THAT SHE DID--FAR FROM IT
I DON'T USE THEM AND I DON'T SPEND ANYTHING ON THEIR KEEP
NO NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY YOU WILL SEE AND I WENT BACK INTO THE ROOM
SHE WAS NEVER SEEN WITH ANY FLOWERS BUT CAMELLIAS
YOU WENT TO SEE PRUDENCE WHO TOLD YOU NANINE AND HOW DID SHE KNOW SHE FOLLOWED YOU YOU TOLD HER TO FOLLOW ME YES
I THEN WROTE HER THE LETTER WHICH SHE ANSWERED IN THE WAY YOU KNOW
ALWAYS THERE WAS THE SAME GAIETY IN HER THE SAME EMOTION IN ME
IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF I WAS COMING NEARER AND NEARER TO MARGUERITE
THEY ARE THE BEST COMMENTARY ON WHAT I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU
HE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WELL ALL RIGHT
DEATH HAD PURIFIED THE AIR OF THIS ABODE OF SPLENDID FOULNESS AND IF MORE EXCUSE WERE NEEDED THEY HAD THE EXCUSE THAT THEY HAD MERELY COME TO A SALE THEY KNEW NOT WHOSE
WHAT I SAID TO THE ATTENDANT
I ASKED HIM TO SHOW ME THE GRAVE FOR THERE IS NO FINDING ONE'S WAY WITHOUT A GUIDE IN THIS CITY OF THE DEAD WHICH HAS ITS STREETS LIKE A CITY OF THE LIVING
CHAPTER 26 WHAT FOLLOWED THAT FATAL NIGHT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I
IT HAS ONLY ONE MERIT WHICH WILL PERHAPS BE DENIED IT
LET THE REST ALONE
IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT SOME ONE SHOULD BE WAITING FOR YOU JUST AS IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT I SHOULD GO FROM HERE AT THREE IN THE MORNING HAVE YOU TOO SOME ONE WAITING FOR YOU NO BUT I MUST GO GOOD-BYE THEN YOU SEND ME AWAY NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD WHY ARE YOU SO UNKIND TO ME HOW HAVE I BEEN UNKIND TO YOU IN TELLING ME THAT SOME ONE WAS WAITING FOR YOU I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE IDEA THAT YOU HAD BEEN SO HAPPY TO SEE ME COME IN ALONE WHEN THERE WAS SUCH A GOOD REASON FOR IT ONE FINDS PLEASURE IN CHILDISH ENOUGH THINGS AND IT IS TOO BAD TO DESTROY SUCH A PLEASURE WHEN BY SIMPLY LEAVING IT ALONE ONE CAN MAKE SOMEBODY SO HAPPY BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM
ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT I GAINED AND IT WAS I WHO GAVE HER MONEY TO PLAY FOR SHE HAD LOST ALL SHE HAD BEFORE HER AND PROBABLY ALL SHE HAD IN THE HOUSE
WELL SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
BRING ME BACK THE KEY AND GO
WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
AND MAKING A DESPERATE EFFORT TO RESTRAIN HIS TEARS HE RUSHED RATHER THAN WENT OUT OF THE ROOM
HAVE NO FEAR
THEN I MET YOU YOUNG ARDENT HAPPY AND I TRIED TO MAKE YOU THE MAN I HAD LONGED FOR IN MY NOISY SOLITUDE
I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY AND OF HOW ONE HEARS ONE FINE DAY OF THEIR HASTY DISAPPEARANCE AND TARDY CONDEMNATION
TRY TO BE MORE AGREEABLE THAN HE IS OR I KNOW MARGUERITE SHE WILL PUT IT ALL DOWN TO ME WE FOLLOWED PRUDENCE DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A LETTER AND MY ORDERS FOR YOU KNOW YOU ARE TO OBEY BLINDLY YES
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO SEE ME IN MY BOX AT THE VARIETES I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE INDISCREET FRIENDS AND MARGUERITE LINGERED OVER THE WORD AS IF TO INTIMATE TO THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT THAT IN SPITE OF THE FAMILIAR WAY IN WHICH SHE GREETED HIM GASTON WAS NOT AND NEVER HAD BEEN ANYTHING MORE THAN A FRIEND FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME THEN WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO INTRODUCE M
IN A FEW DAYS YOUR HORSES YOUR DIAMONDS AND YOUR SHAWLS SHALL BE RETURNED TO YOU
THIS IS THE THIRD NIGHT YOU HAVE SAT UP AND YOU MUST BE IN WANT OF SLEEP
I WILL SELL THE REST OF WHAT I DO NOT WANT AND WITH THIS ALONE I WILL MAKE TWO THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
BUT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY CEREMONIOUS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU TO-DAY THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN GONE TO THE HOTEL TO WHICH I HAVE SENT MY LUGGAGE AND HAVE RUSHED STRAIGHT HERE FEARING THAT AFTER ALL I MIGHT MISS YOU EARLY AS IT IS I BEGGED M
YOU ARE WITNESS OF WHAT I FELT AS THE HOUR OF OUR SEPARATION APPROACHED
A CHILD SAYS THE FABLE HAVING OFTEN AMUSED HIMSELF BY CRYING HELP
CALLED
WHEN MY MOTHER DIED SHE LEFT SIX THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WHICH HE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF ON THE VERY DAY WHEN HE RECEIVED HIS APPOINTMENT
IT IS THEIR ONE DISTRACTION AND THEIR ONE EXCUSE
THERE WERE ALL THE CELEBRITIES OF THE MOST ELEGANT IMPROPRIETY FURTIVELY EXAMINED BY CERTAIN GREAT LADIES WHO HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE SALE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE CLOSE AT HAND WOMEN WHOM THEY MIGHT NEVER HAVE ANOTHER OCCASION OF MEETING AND WHOM THEY ENVIED PERHAPS IN SECRET FOR THEIR EASY PLEASURES
I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS BUT NONE MORE CHARMING THAN THIS LITTLE VILLAGE GAILY SEATED AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL WHICH PROTECTS IT
I AM THE LOVER OF MLLE
THE CONSTANT SIGHT OF DISSIPATION PRECOCIOUS DISSIPATION IN ADDITION TO HER CONSTANT SICKLY STATE HAD EXTINGUISHED IN HER MIND ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THAT GOD HAD PERHAPS GIVEN HER BUT THAT NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF DEVELOPING
WE WILL BE HAPPY
SHE LOVES AND SHE TOO HAS MADE THIS LOVE THE DREAM OF HER LIFE
THE WAITER GAVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT OR RATHER SERVED UP TO ME WHATEVER HE LIKED FOR I ATE NOTHING
COME DURING THE THIRD ENTR'ACTE I PUT THE LETTER INTO A DRAWER SO THAT I MIGHT ALWAYS HAVE IT AT BAND IN CASE I DOUBTED ITS REALITY AS I DID FROM TIME TO TIME
I WENT WITHOUT EITHER RELUCTANCE OR ENTHUSIASM WITH THAT SORT OF APATHY INTO WHICH I HAD SUNK SINCE MY DEPARTURE
SET IN AN OVAL OF INDESCRIBABLE GRACE TWO BLACK EYES SURMOUNTED BY EYEBROWS OF SO PURE A CURVE THAT IT SEEMED AS IF PAINTED
IN THIS GIRL THERE WAS AT ONCE THE VIRGIN WHOM A MERE NOTHING HAD TURNED INTO A COURTESAN AND THE COURTESAN WHOM A MERE NOTHING WOULD HAVE TURNED INTO THE MOST LOVING AND THE PUREST OF VIRGINS
I WAS RATHER FORGOTTEN
THE COUNT THEREUPON LEFT HIS POSITION BY THE FIREPLACE AND GOING UP TO HER SAID
THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME SINCE I HAD THE KEY TO GO AND SEE HER AS USUAL
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I SHOULD ONLY BE TAKING A YEAR OF YOUR FUTURE I COULD NOT HAVE RESISTED THE LONGING TO SPEND THAT YEAR WITH YOU AND AT LEAST I SHOULD HAVE DIED WITH A FRIEND TO HOLD MY HAND
HE CALLS HER HIS DAUGHTER
NOW THAT I AM SO NEAR DEATH IN SPITE OF WHAT THE DOCTORS TELL ME FOR I HAVE SEVERAL WHICH PROVES THAT I AM GETTING WORSE I AM ALMOST SORRY THAT I LISTENED TO YOUR FATHER
YOUR FRIENDS WILL COME AND LOOK AFTER YOU
A MOMENT AFTER MY FRIEND RETURNED
IS TO BE YOUR ASSOCIATE IN THIS PRETTY PLAN OF WHICH I CAN ACCEPT NEITHER THE COST NOR THE BENEFITS WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE
PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER
THE COMTE DE N
ARMAND DUVAL HER SUPERIOR IN VICE OR IN AFFECTION
IT IS SNOWING AND I AM ALONE
BY THE TIME YOU READ THIS LETTER ARMAND I SHALL BE THE MISTRESS OF ANOTHER MAN
HE HAS HAD SUPPER WITH ME TWICE AND HASN'T EVEN CALLED THAT THEN WAS THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY MY LETTER AND MY JEALOUSY
I HAVE NEVER FOUND ONE
THE DAWN BEGAN TO BREAK
FEBRUARY 19 MIDNIGHT
WE ARRIVED AT C WHERE I SAW M
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND OF CURIOSITIES AND I MADE UP MY MIND NOT TO MISS THE OCCASION IF NOT OF BUYING SOME AT ALL EVENTS OF SEEING THEM
I KNOW ALL THAT IS IN THESE PAPERS BY HEART HE SAID
HE CAST A REALLY SUPPLICATING GLANCE AT MARGUERITE
I RECOGNISED MARGUERITE'S WRITING
I TOLD HER TO LET WHAT THEY CALL JUSTICE HAVE ITS WAY
I HAD FOLLOWED HER I HAD BEEN SO AFFECTED AS TO BE UNABLE TO HIDE IT FROM HER I HAD WEPT AS I KISSED HER HAND
I GAMBLED I COMMITTED EVERY EXTRAVAGANCE WHICH COULD BE EXPECTED OF A MAN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A WOMAN AS OLYMPE
YOU WHO WILL NOT LET ME TAKE YOU ON YOUR OWN LEVEL BUT INSIST ON TAKING ME ON MINE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DID
IT IS THE WHIM OF A DYING WOMAN THEN SHE EMBRACED ME WITH TEARS AND ADDED
THE ACCENT WHICH I HAD GIVEN TO MY LAST WORD SEEMED TO CONVINCE MY ADVERSARY
I WILL SEE YOU TO-MORROW
OLD MEN ARE NOT PATIENT NO DOUBT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT THEY ARE NOT ETERNAL
HE LIVES AT RUE DE
I HAD LOVED I STILL LOVED THIS WOMAN SO MUCH THAT I COULD NOT SUDDENLY BECOME INDIFFERENT TO HER
ERNEST CAME BACK TO HIS PLACE BESIDE ME
SOME OF HIS FRIENDS HAVE BEEN TELLING HIM TALES WHICH HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
THIS IS HOW THESE DETAILS CAME TO MY KNOWLEDGE
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS RESOLUTION AND CONVINCED THAT I SHOULD NOT SLEEP IF I WENT TO BED I BEGAN TO PACK UP MY THINGS
BUT HOUR FOLLOWED HOUR AND SHE DID NOT COME
THIS IS WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED
SHE IS REALLY VERY PRETTY WHOM DOES SHE LIVE WITH WITH NOBODY
I MIGHT HAVE MADE MARGUERITE A PRESENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO MY GENEROSITY AND PERMIT ME TO FEEL PROPERLY QUITS OF HER AS OF A KEPT WOMAN BUT I SHOULD HAVE FELT THAT I WAS OFFENDING BY THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF TRAFFICKING IF NOT THE LOVE WHICH SHE HAD FOR ME AT ALL EVENTS THE LOVE WHICH I HAD FOR HER AND SINCE THIS LOVE WAS SO PURE THAT IT COULD ADMIT NO DIVISION IT COULD NOT PAY BY A PRESENT HOWEVER GENEROUS THE HAPPINESS THAT IT HAD RECEIVED HOWEVER SHORT THAT HAPPINESS HAD BEEN
BLUE EYES
NEVERTHELESS THE TONE IN WHICH HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS WAS SO KIND SO APPEALING THAT I DARED NOT ANSWER
I CAN NOT BREATHE
IT IS NOT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU MARGUERITE MADE A GESTURE AS IF TO SAY OH IT IS LONG SINCE THAT I HAVE DONE WITH PROPRIETY AT THAT MOMENT NANINE APPEARED
I REMAINED WHERE I WAS
CHAPTER 5 A GOOD WHILE ELAPSED BEFORE I HEARD ANYTHING MORE OF ARMAND BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS CONSTANTLY HEARING OF MARGUERITE
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT WHENEVER I MET FRIENDS TO WHOM I HAD NEVER BREATHED THE NAME OF MARGUERITE I ALWAYS BEGAN BY SAYING
I AM SUFFOCATED
AND IT IS NEEDFUL THAT THE BEGINNING OF THESE WAYS SHOULD NOT BE TOO PAINFUL NOR APPEAR TOO IMPENETRABLE
A MONTH OF LOVE LIKE THAT AND THERE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ONLY THE CORPSE OF HEART OR BODY
OFTEN IN THE EVENING I MEET THERE A CERTAIN COMTE DE N WHO THINKS HE IS MAKING SOME HEADWAY BY CALLING ON HER AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING AND BY SENDING HER JEWELS TO ANY EXTENT
I WILL GO AND TELL MY FRIEND GO THEN
THE DUKE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE
I WAS VERY SORRY TO HEAR OF HER DEATH HAD SHE NOT A LOVER CALLED ARMAND DUVAL TALL AND BLOND YES
LOVE HIM WELL MY FRIEND FOR THERE ARE FEW MEN SO WORTHY OF BEING LOVED
MY GOOD MARGUERITE I SAID TO HER I AM GOING TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO GO TO PARIS
YOU HAVE SEEN BY THE AMOUNT TAKEN AT THE SALE THAT THIS HONEST MAN WOULD HAVE GAINED THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS OUT OF HIS CLIENT
TO PARIS YES SIR WHEN AN HOUR AFTER YOU SHE LEFT NO WORD FOR ME NOTHING NANINE LEFT ME
I TOOK HER HAND AND THANKED HER FOR HER COUNSELS
THAT DURING HER ILLNESS SHE HAD LENT HER A LOT OF MONEY IN THE FORM OF PROMISSORY NOTES WHICH SHE COULD NOT PAY MARGUERITE HAVING DIED WITHOUT HAVING RETURNED HER THE MONEY AND WITHOUT HAVING GIVEN HER A RECEIPT WITH WHICH SHE COULD PRESENT HERSELF AS A CREDITOR
IT LOOKED AS IF HE REJOICED SECRETLY TO SEE THE RAVAGES THAT DISEASE HAD MADE IN ME
THAT NIGHT NO ONE WAS PASSING
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED
SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER
THE EFFORTS OF EVERY INTELLIGENT MAN TEND IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND EVERY STRONG WILL IS HARNESSED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLE
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER I WAS ONCE MORE IN MY OWN QUARTERS AND I WROTE TO MARGUERITE
YOU WHO DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MY AFFECTION IS SUFFICIENTLY DISINTERESTED TO SHARE WITH ME WHAT YOU HAVE THOUGH WE COULD LIVE HAPPILY ENOUGH ON IT TOGETHER AND WOULD RATHER RUIN YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL BOUND BY A FOOLISH PREJUDICE
PARDON FOR WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY TO MLLE
THROUGH THIS BEWILDERMENT I HEARD THE INSPECTOR SAY TO DUVAL DO YOU IDENTIFY YES REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN IN A DULL VOICE
ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE
THE CARRIAGE DROVE OFF
WELL IT IS AGREED CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHEN WE WERE ALONE YOU WON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH ME I WILL GO AWAY SO MUCH AS THAT I HAD GONE TOO FAR TO DRAW BACK
HIS HANDS WERE COLD
MARGUERITE SEATED ON THE SOFA WAS MEDITATING
HE WAS GIVEN PART PAYMENT OUT OF THE FEW THOUSAND FRANCS THAT I GOT FROM YOU
AS YOU HAVE SEEN HE HAS REPURCHASED HER HORSES HE HAS TAKEN HER JEWELS OUT OF PAWN AND HE GIVES HER AS MUCH MONEY AS THE DUKE USED TO GIVE HER
THE NIGHT WAS SO DARK THAT AT EVERY STEP I FEARED TO DASH MYSELF AGAINST ONE OF THE TREES ON THE ROADSIDE WHICH ROSE UP SHARPLY BEFORE ME LIKE GREAT PHANTOMS RUSHING UPON ME
THEY DO NOT KNOW MY ADDRESS AND I EXPECT THERE ARE LETTERS FROM MY FATHER WAITING FOR ME
THAT IS WHAT I ASK MYSELF TO-DAY AS I LIE ILL IN MY BED THAT I SHALL NEVER LEAVE PERHAPS UNTIL I AM DEAD
HER FIRM WALK HER SUPPLE FIGURE HER ROSY OPEN NOSTRILS HER LARGE EYES SLIGHTLY TINGED WITH BLUE INDICATED ONE OF THOSE ARDENT NATURES WHICH SHED AROUND THEM A SORT OF VOLUPTUOUS PERFUME LIKE EASTERN VIALS WHICH CLOSE THEM AS TIGHTLY AS YOU WILL STILL LET SOME OF THEIR PERFUME ESCAPE
I HAD ALL THE LOVE FOR YOU THAT A WOMAN'S HEART CAN HOLD AND GIVE AND YOU ARE FAR AWAY YOU ARE CURSING ME AND THERE IS NOT A WORD OF CONSOLATION FROM YOU
NO DOUBT HE GUESSED THE REASON OF MY DEPARTURE FOR HE INSISTED THAT I SHOULD STAY BUT SEEING THAT IF I DID NOT CARRY OUT MY INTENTION THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE STATE IN WHICH I WAS MIGHT BE FATAL HE EMBRACED ME AND BEGGED ME ALMOST WITH TEARS TO RETURN WITHOUT DELAY
BUT AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING I WAS STILL AWAITING HIM
YOU WILL BE SORRY FOR IT ONE DAY
DUVERNOY'S BOX
THEY WILL SOON GO WHEN THEY SEE YOU HAVE GONE THEY WILL TURN EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN BUT WHAT DO THEY WANT THEY WANT TO SEE YOU WHAT ARE THEY CALLED YOU KNOW ONE M
PERHAPS AM IN THE WRONG BUT I CAN ONLY BE HAPPY AS LONG AS I AM THE LOVER OF THIS WOMAN COME ARMAND OPEN YOUR EYES
AND BY THE END OF THE EVENING I HAD SPENT FOUR OR FIVE LOUIS WHICH CAME TO TWO OR THREE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH WHICH REDUCED MY YEAR TO THREE MONTHS AND A HALF AND MADE IT NECESSARY FOR ME EITHER TO GO INTO DEBT OR TO LEAVE MARGUERITE
OPEN IT THEY OBEYED AS IF IT WERE THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD
JULIE IS VERY GOOD TO ME
BUT THERE IS STILL PLENTY TO DO BEFORE IT WILL BE QUITE ALL IT SHOULD BE
I WAS LIKE A MAN DRUNK UPON BAD WINE WHO FALLS INTO ONE OF THOSE NERVOUS EXALTATIONS IN WHICH THE HAND IS CAPABLE OF COMMITTING A CRIME WITHOUT THE HEAD KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT
NO HE REPLIED AND I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO TAKE HIM AWAY
THE MAN HAD PROMISED TO PAY ALL HER DEBTS TO GIVE HER A RECEIPT FOR THE AMOUNT AND TO HAND OVER TO HER TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN RETURN FOR THE WHOLE OF HER FURNITURE
IF YOU MAKE SCENES OF JEALOUSY LIKE THIS BEFORE WHAT WILL IT BE AFTER IF THAT AFTER SHOULD EVER EXIST
A SHARP FEAR PENETRATED MY HEART
THE BLOOD FLEW TO HER CHEEKS AND HER LIPS HALF OPENED IN A SLIGHT COUGH
I RECEIVED THEM ALL WITH A KIND OF JOY FOR BESIDES PROVING TO ME THAT YOU STILL LOVED ME IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THE MORE YOU PERSECUTED ME THE MORE I SHOULD BE RAISED IN YOUR EYES WHEN YOU CAME TO KNOW THE TRUTH
SHE IS DYING THE HEART IS A STRANGE THING
MEANWHILE TAKE A BOOK
IT WAS AS IF HE GUESSED MY DESIRE FOR HE SAID TO ME
QUICK SAID THE INSPECTOR
I SPEND ON HER ACCOUNT WHAT MY MEANS ALLOW ME TO SPEND
THE WEATHER HAD BEEN SUPERB AND THE SUN SANK TO SLEEP IN A TWILIGHT DAZZLING WITH GOLD AND AZURE
HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL HIS AGITATION AND IT WAS WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND A TREMBLING VOICE THAT HE SAID TO ME
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE
WE MUST ADD THAT MARGUERITE HAD RETURNED MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN
PARDON PARDON I MURMURED
MY SISTER NATURALLY KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS THAT I WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN SO LIGHTHEARTED HAD SUDDENLY BECOME SO SAD AND DREAMY
YOU KNOW WHOM YOU HAVE TO DO WITH
SO A MONTH PASSED AND ALL THE TIME MARGUERITE WAS MORE JOYOUS AND MORE AFFECTIONATE THAN SHE EVER HAD BEEN
THE DOCTOR TELLS ME THAT SHE IS NOT HERE FOR LONG
IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND
I WRITE YOU THESE DETAILS FROM HER HOUSE IN THE MIDST OF MY TEARS AND UNDER THE LAMP WHICH BURNS SADLY BESIDE A DINNER WHICH I CAN NOT TOUCH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BUT WHICH NANINE HAS GOT FOR ME FOR I HAVE EATEN NOTHING FOR TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO BE IN MY PLACE
AT THE SAME INSTANT MARGUERITE CALLED TO US
WHEN SHE CAME BACK HE HAD GONE AND YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SINCE NEVER I TOO HAD NOT SEEN ARMAND AGAIN
MY LOVE FOR HER CARRIED TO THE POINT AT WHICH IT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO HATRED REJOICED AT THE SIGHT OF HER DAILY SORROW
IN AN INSTANT I DECIDED THE WHOLE COURSE OF MY LIFE
THE PORTER ASKED ME WHERE I WAS GOING
IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SETTING AT THE OUTSET OF LIFE TWO SIGN-POSTS ONE BEARING THE INSCRIPTION THE RIGHT WAY THE OTHER THE INSCRIPTION THE WRONG WAY AND OF SAYING TO THOSE WHO COME THERE CHOOSE ONE MUST NEEDS LIKE CHRIST POINT OUT THE WAYS WHICH LEAD FROM THE SECOND ROAD TO THE FIRST TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN EASILY LED ASTRAY
THE SOUL HAS STRANGE REFUGES
I CAN'T HELP IT
AND YOUR FATHER I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM
WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE CALMED DOWN I TOLD HER THE RESULT OF MY VISIT AND I SHOWED HER MY FATHER'S LETTER FROM WHICH I SAID WE MIGHT AUGUR WELL
ARE YOU SURE BESIDES THAT THE LIFE WHICH YOU ARE GIVING UP FOR HIM WILL NEVER AGAIN COME TO ATTRACT YOU
MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE
I MET HER TO-DAY I CONTINUED CARELESSLY
ONE OF THE HORSES IS ILL AND THERE ARE SOME REPAIRS TO BE DONE
THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN MARGUERITE'S WINDOWS
MY GLASS REMAINED FULL AND I FELT ALMOST SAD AS I SAW THIS BEAUTIFUL CREATURE OF TWENTY DRINKING TALKING LIKE A PORTER AND LAUGHING THE MORE LOUDLY THE MORE SCANDALOUS WAS THE JOKE
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TOOK A CAB AND RETURNED TO BOUGIVAL
IF YOU LIKE AND THEN YOU WILL BE NICE TO ME TILL THE VERY MOMENT YOU GO YES
THEY NEVER RENDER US A SERVICE HOWEVER SLIGHT WITHOUT SEEING THAT THEY ARE PAID TWICE ITS VALUE
NONE OF THESE DETAILS ESCAPED MY FATHER AND HE WAS NOT DECEIVED BY MY EXTERIOR CALM
I DID NOT REALIZE WHAT I WAS DOING UNTIL THE TOWN HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE SOLITUDE OF THE ROAD RECALLED TO ME THE EMPTINESS OF MY HEART
MARGUERITE ENTERED
THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE
IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM
MARGUERITE IS STILL CONSCIOUS OF WHAT GOES ON AROUND HER AND SHE SUFFERS IN BODY MIND AND HEART
TELL ME EXACTLY HOW MUCH MARGUERITE IS IN NEED OF I HAVE TOLD YOU
WE ARE TELLING OF TRUE FACTS WHICH IT WOULD BE BETTER NO DOUBT TO PASS OVER IN SILENCE IF WE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS NEEDFUL FROM TIME TO TIME TO REVEAL THE MARTYRDOM OF THOSE WHO ARE CONDEMNED WITHOUT BEARING SCORNED WITHOUT JUDGING
IN SPITE OF HERSELF MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED
SHE HAD BECOME A NECESSITY TO HIS HEART HIS ONLY PRETEXT HIS ONLY EXCUSE FOR LIVING
PERHAPS PRUDENCE WROTE TO HER ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
CHAPTER 2 THE SALE WAS TO TAKE PLACE ON THE 16TH
YOU WILL LEAVE THIS WOMAN
WELL I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO RECONCILE EVERYTHING MY MONEY AFFAIRS AND MY LOVE FOR YOU
WHILE I WENT TO GIVE NOTICE AT MY OWN FLAT MARGUERITE WENT TO SEE A BUSINESS AGENT WHO SHE TOLD ME HAD ALREADY DONE FOR ONE OF HER FRIENDS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED HIM TO DO FOR HER
THIS THEN WAS THE STATE OF THINGS THREE MONTHS AFTER MARGUERITE'S RETURN
YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING
MARGUERITE DID NOT ANSWER
I TRAVELLED
WHEN I ENTERED THE BOX MARGUERITE WAS IN FITS OF LAUGHTER
I MAKE THESE REFLECTIONS TO-DAY
DON'T GO BEFORE I CAN SPEAK WITH YOU WE ARE DOUBTLESS INTRUDERS I SAID AND NOW THAT WE OR RATHER I HAVE HAD A SECOND INTRODUCTION TO BLOT OUT THE FIRST IT IS TIME FOR GASTON AND ME TO BE GOING NOT IN THE LEAST
MEANWHILE I WILL GET INTO BED I CLOSED THE WINDOW
WHY HOLDING OBSTINATELY TO THE OPINIONS OF THE WORLD WHICH HARDENS ITSELF IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE THOUGHT STRONG DO WE REJECT AS IT REJECTS SOULS BLEEDING AT WOUNDS BY WHICH LIKE A SICK MAN'S BAD BLOOD THE EVIL OF THEIR PAST MAY BE HEALED IF ONLY A FRIENDLY HAND IS STRETCHED OUT TO LAVE THEM AND SET THEM IN THE CONVALESCENCE OF THE HEART
THIS IS WHAT I WAS TOLD ON THE SUBJECT
PERHAPS MY DESIRE TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HAD MUCH TO DO WITH THE ANXIETY WHICH ARMAND'S SILENCE CAUSED ME
SHE WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED
SHE WILL GIVE YOU MY JOURNAL
FROM THIS MOMENT ALL THE INCIDENTS GROUPED THEMSELVES ABOUT MY FIRST SUSPICION AND FIXED IT SO FIRMLY IN MY MIND THAT EVERYTHING SERVED TO CONFIRM IT EVEN MY FATHER'S KINDNESS
POOR THING I AM KILLING HER
WHENEVER THERE WAS A NEW PIECE SHE WAS CERTAIN TO BE SEEN AND SHE INVARIABLY HAD THREE THINGS WITH HER ON THE LEDGE OF HER GROUND-FLOOR BOX
YOUR FATHER WAS NO LONGER THERE TO SUPPORT ME AND THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN I WAS ON THE POINT OF CONFESSING EVERYTHING TO YOU SO TERRIFIED WAS I AT THE IDEA THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BATE AND DESPISE ME
I AM NEITHER MAID NOR DUCHESS
I HAD ONLY KNOWN MARGUERITE FOR THIRTY-SIX HOURS
THERE WAS A LIGHT
I GLANCED AT THE CARD AND THERE READ THESE TWO WORDS
VERY PALE HER MOUTH HALF OPEN MARGUERITE TRIED TO RECOVER BREATH
THEY WILL THINK YOU ARE MAD WHAT DID MARGUERITE SAY AFTER I HAD GONE SHE LAUGHED AND SAID SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE SO FUNNY
AND THE TWO YEARS THAT HAD PASSED SINCE I SAW HER AND WHAT HAD SEEMED TO BE THE RESULTS OF THAT SEPARATION VANISHED IN SMOKE AT THE MERE TOUCH OF HER DRESS
THEN WHEN ONLY THE STONES COVERING THE COFFIN WERE LEFT HE THREW THEM OUT ONE BY ONE
ALL MARGUERITE'S LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED INTO THE KISSES WITH WHICH SHE COVERED ME AND I LOVED HER SO MUCH THAT IN MY TRANSPORTS OF FEVERISH LOVE I ASKED MYSELF WHETHER I SHOULD NOT KILL HER SO THAT SHE MIGHT NEVER BELONG TO ANOTHER
FOR MY PART MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY IN MY BREAST
YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR WHICH HE WILL NOT TAKE BECAUSE HE WILL COME DURING THE DAY WHEN HE COMES
MARGUERITE DREW BACK THE BAG AND TURNING BEGAN TO TALK WITH THE DUKE
I DID NOT EVEN WRITE TO TELL OLYMPE NOT TO EXPECT ME
AH HE WENT ON WHEN WE HAD LEFT THE SHOP DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF WOMAN IT IS THAT I AM GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO
AS HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CAST A GLANCE AT PRUDENCE
I DO NOT GIVE MLLE
AN HOUR AFTER I SENT FOR MY PURCHASE
WELL THEY ARE TRUE
MEN INSTEAD OF BEING SATISFIED IN OBTAINING FOR A LONG TIME WHAT THEY SCARCELY HOPED TO OBTAIN ONCE EXACT FROM THEIR MISTRESSES A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE PRESENT THE PAST AND EVEN THE FUTURE
THEN THE DAY OF REPROACHES AND REGRETS WOULD ARRIVE BE SURE FOR YOU OR FOR OTHERS AND YOU WOULD BOTH BEAR A CHAIN THAT YOU COULD NOT SEVER
AT LAST I BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD COME TO SEE ME HERSELF
ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
I HAD NEVER LOVED MY FATHER AS I LOVED HIM AT THAT MOMENT
BUT I CAN NOT LEAVE C AND ARMAND IS SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM HERE
MEANWHILE I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A BOOK FOR I DARED NOT THINK
TWO O'CLOCK STRUCK
MYSELF FIRST OF ALL IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I SHALL GET UP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS IT WOULD BE VERY UNWISE I MUST WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO IN SUCH A GREAT HURRY I MUST GO TO THE INSPECTOR OF POLICE WHY DO YOU NOT GET ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS TO SEE AFTER THE MATTER
THE BODY WAS TOO MUCH WEAKENED BY THE ATTACK OF FEVER AND EVEN BY THE PROCESS OF ITS CURE TO PERMIT HIM ANY VIOLENT EMOTIONS AND THE UNIVERSAL JOY OF SPRING WHICH WRAPPED HIM ROUND CARRIED HIS THOUGHTS INSTINCTIVELY TO IMAGES OF JOY
THE BAILIFF CAME INTO MY ROOM WITH HIS HAT ON
AS FOR ME I WAS SO AGITATED THAT I SAW NOTHING BUT THE CARRIAGE
I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE
I NEED NOT TELL YOU IN WHAT STATE OF AGITATION I SPENT THE NEXT DAY
I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE DUKE TO ASK HIM FOR MONEY FOR I HAVE NONE AND THE CREDITORS HAVE RETURNED AND COME TO ME WITH THEIR BILLS WITH PITILESS PERSEVERANCE
I SAID TO MYSELF UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THESE FEVERISH RESOLUTIONS WHICH ONE ALWAYS FEELS AS IF ONE HAD THE FORCE TO CARRY OUT THAT I MUST BREAK WITH MY AMOUR AT ONCE AND I WAITED IMPATIENTLY FOR DAYLIGHT IN ORDER TO SET OUT FORTHWITH TO REJOIN MY FATHER AND MY SISTER OF WHOSE LOVE AT LEAST I WAS CERTAIN AND CERTAIN THAT THAT LOVE WOULD NEVER BE BETRAYED
HAS PRUDENCE COME SAID MARGUERITE
LEAVE PARIS
I WAS LOWERED IN MY OWN ESTEEM AS WELL AS IN MY LOVE
I WOKE WITH A START NOT RECALLING WHY I WAS IN THE CARRIAGE
BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY
AT LEAST THAT'S WHERE I ALWAYS GO TO GET MY MONEY FOR THE FLOWERS YOU SEE THERE THANKS MY GOOD MAN I GAVE ONE MORE LOOK AT THE GRAVE COVERED WITH FLOWERS HALF LONGING TO PENETRATE THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AND SEE WHAT THE EARTH HAD MADE OF THE FAIR CREATURE THAT HAD BEEN CAST TO IT
SHE PUT THE LITTLE FIGURE ON ONE SIDE AND TOOK ME INTO THE DRESSING-ROOM WHERE SHE SHOWED ME TWO MINIATURES HANGING SIDE BY SIDE AND SAID
YOU WHO WISH ME TO KEEP THE LUXURY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I HAVE LIVED AND SO KEEP THE MORAL DISTANCE WHICH SEPARATES US
GAUTIER'S I SAID
COME AND SEE ME WE WILL LAUGH AND TALK BUT DON'T EXAGGERATE WHAT I AM WORTH FOR I AM WORTH VERY LITTLE
SHE HAS BEEN ILL
AS FOR ME THOUGH MY INITIALS DID NOT OCCUR ON ANY OF MARGUERITE'S BELONGINGS THAT INSTINCTIVE INDULGENCE THAT NATURAL PITY THAT I HAVE ALREADY CONFESSED SET ME THINKING OVER HER DEATH MORE PERHAPS THAN IT WAS WORTH THINKING OVER
HERE IS CHRISTIANITY WITH ITS MARVELLOUS PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON TO TEACH US INDULGENCE AND PARDON
I HOPE THAT YOUR INDISPOSITION YESTERDAY WAS NOT SERIOUS
NO ONE EVER KNEW THE REASON OF THIS CHANGE OF COLOUR WHICH I MENTION THOUGH I CAN NOT EXPLAIN IT
I GAVE IT TO HER AND FREE THEN TO GO I RETURNED HOME
DO YOU STILL SUFFER VERY LITTLE AND SHE WIPED OFF WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF THE TEARS WHICH THE COUGHING HAD BROUGHT TO HER EYES
THINK IT OVER MY DEAR OLYMPE
MAY WE SEE THE BEDROOM YES PRUDENCE WENT INTO THE BEDROOM NOT SO MUCH TO SEE IT AS TO MAKE UP FOR THE FOOLISH THING WHICH SHE HAD JUST SAID AND TO LEAVE MARGUERITE AND ME ALONE
MY POOR FRIEND I AM THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR DISTRESS
I WALKED SMOKED TALKED BUT WHAT I SAID WHOM I MET I HAD UTTERLY FORGOTTEN BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT SHE WILL TAKE THE COMTE DE N AND SHE WILL SAVE UP DURING THE WINTER AND NEXT SUMMER YOU WILL BEGIN OVER AGAIN
HE WON'T BE LONG IN LEAVING THE COAST CLEAR PRUDENCE OPENED THE WINDOW AND WE LEANED SIDE BY SIDE OVER THE BALCONY
BUT ARMAND ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPEAKING OF HER NOT AS FORMERLY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES BUT WITH A SWEET SMILE WHICH REASSURED ME AS TO THE STATE OF HIS MIND
THOUGH IT WAS APRIL SHE WAS STILL WEARING A WINTER COSTUME ALL WRAPPED UP IN FURS
I LOVE YOU MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
I WILL SEE HER TOMORROW I TOOK LEAVE OF MME
TIME WENT SLOWLY
ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED MME
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FIGURE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MARGUERITE
THIS SCENE HAS MADE ME WORSE THAN I WAS BEFORE
BUT DO NOT LINK YOUR FUTURE ANY MORE WITH MINE YOU WOULD BE TOO UNHAPPY AND YOU WOULD MAKE ME TOO UNHAPPY
I STOPPED AND CRIED OUT MARGUERITE
NEXT DAY IN THE MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DUVAL TELLING ME OF HIS RETURN AND ASKING ME TO CALL ON HIM AS HE WAS SO WORN OUT WITH FATIGUE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GO OUT
I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO MY DAILY VISITS DURING THE TWO MONTHS OF HER ILLNESS MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HER THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MEN SHE KNEW AND PERHAPS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF THAT FOR A LOVE WHICH COULD THUS MANIFEST ITSELF SHE MIGHT WELL DO WHAT SHE HAD DONE SO OFTEN THAT IT HAD NO MORE CONSEQUENCE FOR HER
WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
SHE WELCOMED HER BROTHER'S RETURN WITH SMILES NOT KNOWING IN THE PURITY OF HER YOUTH THAT FAR AWAY A COURTESAN HAD SACRIFICED HER OWN HAPPINESS AT THE MERE INVOCATION OF HER NAME
BUT IT IS ONLY CHANCE THAT HAS MADE YOU LEAVE ME I AM SURE FOR IF YOU WERE AT PARIS YOU WOULD NOT LEAVE MY BEDSIDE
ISN'T THE COMTE DE G
FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS
AT NIGHT I SLEPT A LITTLE
THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
MY LIFE CAN NOT RETAIN THESE SAD IMPRESSIONS FOR LONG FOR MY LIFE IS NOT MY OWN ANY MORE THAN MARGUERITE'S WAS HERS
IF I INSIST ON THIS POINT IT IS BECAUSE MANY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE BEGUN TO READ ME WILL BE READY TO THROW DOWN A BOOK IN WHICH THEY WILL FEAR TO FIND AN APOLOGY FOR VICE AND PROSTITUTION
IT WILL BE BETTER IN THE NEW PART WHAT DO YOU CALL THE NEW PART THE NEW PLOTS OF GROUND THAT ARE FOR SALE THERE TO THE LEFT
THE AUCTIONEERS SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
SO THE STEADFAST LOVE THAT SHE HAD HAD FOR ME COULD NOT RESIST THE DESIRE OF RETURNING TO HER FORMER LIFE AND THE NEED OF HAVING A CARRIAGE AND PLUNGING INTO DISSIPATION
MY EXISTENCE BECAME WHAT IT HAD BEEN TWO YEARS BEFORE I KNEW YOU
AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER
SUCH EASINESS IN THE MATTER IS VERY LIKE CALCULATION AND PUTS THE MAN WHO CONSENTS TO IT EVEN OUT OF LOVE VERY MUCH IN THE CATEGORY OF THOSE WHO IN A LOWER STAGE OF SOCIETY MAKE A TRADE OF THEIR CONNIVANCE AND A PROFIT OF THEIR TRADE AH MY DEAR FELLOW HOW OLD-FASHIONED YOU ARE
THOUGH INDEED I MADE THIS REFLECTION THE FIRST IMPRESSION PRODUCED ON ME BY MY FUTURE MISTRESS WAS SO STRONG THAT IT STILL PERSISTED
PEOPLE HAVE NOT ALWAYS PUT SO HIGH A PRICE ON A NIGHT OF MINE
ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES OFTEN REPEATED IN PARIS THE MOTHER CITY OF SCANDAL HAD BEGUN TO BE FORGOTTEN AND I WAS EVEN LITTLE BY LITTLE FORGETTING THE PART I HAD TAKEN IN THEM WHEN A NEW INCIDENT BROUGHT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE OF MARGUERITE'S LIFE AND ACQUAINTED ME WITH SUCH PATHETIC DETAILS THAT I WAS TAKEN WITH THE IDEA OF WRITING DOWN THE STORY WHICH I NOW WRITE
THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING-TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT
THE WHOLE SCENE BREATHED BOREDOM THE MAN EMBARRASSED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS NULLITY THE WOMAN TIRED OF HER DISMAL VISITOR
I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE BUT WITH MARGUERITE GAUTIER
IN A SHORT WHILE MIRTH HAD REACHED ITS LAST LIMIT AND THE WORDS THAT SEEM FUNNY TO A CERTAIN CLASS OF PEOPLE WORDS THAT DEGRADE THE MOUTH THAT UTTERS THEM WERE HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME AMIDST THE APPLAUSE OF NANINE OF PRUDENCE AND OF MARGUERITE
ONE MUST HAVE LIVED THAT LIFE AS I HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE LITTLE VANITIES WHICH THEY AFFORD THEIR LOVERS EVERY DAY HELP TO FASTEN DEEPER INTO THE HEART SINCE WE HAVE NO OTHER WORD FOR IT THE LOVE WHICH HE HAS FOR THEM
DOES ALL THAT SUIT YOU YES I ANSWERED TRYING TO QUIET THE SCRUPLES WHICH THIS WAY OF LIVING AWOKE IN ME FROM TIME TO TIME
WOULD YOU RATHER FOR ME TO GO AND LEAVE YOU TO SLEEP
IT WAS AT ALEXANDRIA THAT I LEARNED FROM AN ATTACHE AT THE EMBASSY WHOM I HAD SOMETIMES SEEN AT MARGUERITE'S THAT THE POOR GIRL WAS SERIOUSLY ILL
ALL HIS LIFE SEEMED TO PASS BEFORE HIS EYES
I CAN SCARCELY HOLD THE PEN WITH WHICH I WRITE TO YOU OF THIS WILD DREAM OF MY HEART
BUT HOW PALE YOU ARE I TOLD HER OF THE SCENE WITH MY FATHER
WE LAUGHED DRANK AND ATE FREELY AT THIS SUPPER
FINALLY MLLE
ONE DAY A YOUNG MAN IS PASSING IN THE STREET HE BRUSHES AGAINST A WOMAN LOOKS AT HER TURNS GOES ON HIS WAY
I WON'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM THAT MAN
THE FIRST PERSON I SAW IN ONE OF THE BOXES WAS MARGUERITE GAUTIER
HE HAD BEEN HER LOVER HE SENT HER A BOX HE ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE THEATRE
I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER THIS MORNING
HOW ONE REALIZES THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE I SAID TO MYSELF BY THE RAPIDITY OF SENSATIONS
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE MAD
THEN DIRECT IMPERTINENCES GAVE WAY TO ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND THERE WAS NOT A SHAMEFUL THING WHICH I DID NOT ENCOURAGE MY MISTRESS TO RELATE AND WHICH I DID NOT MYSELF RELATE IN REFERENCE TO MARGUERITE
SHE RETURNED TO HER CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY
SHE WAS NOWHERE
TAKE A MARRIED WOMAN
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A DECIDED STEP AND FINISH EITHER WITH THE WOMAN OR WITH ONE'S SCRUPLES IF THAT IS SHE WOULD STILL BE WILLING TO SEE ME
OUR HEARTS HAVE THEIR CAPRICES
WE HAVE SELFISH LOVERS WHO SPEND THEIR FORTUNES RIOT ON US AS THEY SAY BUT ON THEIR OWN VANITY
YOU WISHED TO SEE ME AND I HAVE COME AND LETTING HER HEAD FALL ON HER HANDS SHE BURST INTO TEARS
THE WALLS OF CONVENTS ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH MOTHERS HAVE NO LOCKS STRONG ENOUGH RELIGION HAS NO DUTIES CONSTANT ENOUGH TO SHUT THESE CHARMING BIRDS IN THEIR CAGES CAGES NOT EVEN STREWN WITH FLOWERS
THAT TO THE AGE OF PASSION SUCCEEDS THE AGE WHEN MAN IF HE IS TO BE RESPECTED MUST PLANT HIMSELF SOLIDLY IN A SERIOUS POSITION
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF
I RETURNED TO PARIS WHERE I WROTE THIS STORY JUST AS IT HAD BEEN TOLD ME
A VIOLENT AGITATION RAN THROUGH HIS BODY
SHE IS ALMOST ALWAYS DELIRIOUS
TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE BED AS IF SHE WOULD HOLD ON TO HER LIFE WHICH WAS ESCAPING TOWARD GOD
WE GIVE OURSELVES NOW FOR ONE THING NOW FOR ANOTHER
ONE GLANCE AT MARGUERITE'S GRAVE AND I SHALL KNOW IF ARMAND'S SORROW STILL EXISTS AND PERHAPS I MAY FIND OUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM I ENTERED THE KEEPER'S LODGE AND ASKED HIM IF ON THE 22ND OF FEBRUARY A WOMAN NAMED MARGUERITE GAUTIER HAD NOT BEEN BURIED IN THE MONTMARTRE CEMETERY
WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS
JUST NOW I BEGGED YOU
THE SIGNAL FOR RAISING THE CURTAIN WAS GIVEN
THEREUPON ONE OF THE MEN PUT OUT HIS HAND BEGAN TO UNSEW THE SHROUD AND TAKING HOLD OF IT BY ONE END SUDDENLY LAID BARE THE FACE OF MARGUERITE
YOUR FATHER HAD THE OLD THEORY THAT A COURTESAN IS A BEING WITHOUT HEART OR REASON A SORT OF MACHINE FOR COINING GOLD ALWAYS READY LIKE THE MACHINE TO BRUISE THE HAND THAT GIVES HER EVERYTHING AND TO TEAR IN PIECES WITHOUT PITY OR DISCERNMENT THOSE WHO SET HER IN MOTION
I LISTENED AND HEARD NOTHING BUT THE VOICE OF THE WIND IN THE TREES
MY DEAR PRUDENCE YOUR PROTEGE IS NOT POLITE
FROM THAT TIME SEEING THAT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY MISTRESS'S LIFE I CHANGED MY OWN
WHAT A WAY YOU BEHAVED HE SAID AS HE SAT DOWN
I LOOKED AT HIM
HE LET HIMSELF BE GUIDED LIKE A CHILD ONLY FROM TIME TO TIME MURMURING DID YOU SEE HER EYES AND HE TURNED AS IF THE VISION HAD RECALLED HER
WITHOUT KNOWING WHY I TURNED PALE AND MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY
ALL THAT YOU NEED THINK OF UNLESS YOU ARE QUITE A FOOL IS THAT CLOSE BY THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL WHO IS WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR THE MAN WHO IS WITH HER TO GO THINKING OF YOU KEEPING THE WHOLE NIGHT FOR YOU AND WHO LOVES YOU I AM CERTAIN
I HAD SPENT THE DAY IN THE COUNTRY WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS GASTON R WE RETURNED TO PARIS IN THE EVENING AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WE WENT TO THE VARIETES
I WENT UP TO HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE LADY'S NAME
NEVERTHELESS I SURPRISED MOMENTS OF SADNESS EVEN TEARS IN MARGUERITE
WE OFTEN TALK OF YOU TOGETHER
I REFUSED
THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES
THUS A MONTH PASSED BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME I COULD ENDURE IT NO LONGER
AT WHATEVER HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT YOU WILL COME AND I WILL BE YOURS
NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING
NEVER WAS THERE A NOISIER OR A MORE VARIED GATHERING
A HARD DRY COUGH FOLLOWED
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE
ALL THAT I KNEW WAS THAT EVERY THREE MONTHS MY FATHER'S SOLICITOR AN OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY HANDED OVER TO ME SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRANCS IN RETURN FOR MY RECEIPT
NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE
HE IS VERY SAD
NANINE HAD ALREADY OPENED THE DOOR
DUVERNOY SAID
HER SLENDERNESS WAS A CHARM
MY DOCTOR SAYS IT IS BECAUSE I AM NERVOUS AND ALWAYS ILL
IT IS NOT MY FAULT FOR NOT ADVISING HER TO FOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR GIRL STRIPPING HERSELF OF EVERYTHING
MARGUERITE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND SAID GOOD-BYE
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR ON THE EVENING OF A DAY LIKE THIS THAT I FIRST MET MARGUERITE SAID ARMAND TO ME AS IF HE WERE LISTENING TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS RATHER THAN TO WHAT I WAS SAYING
AS NO MAN CARES TO MAKE HIMSELF CONSPICUOUS BY BEING SEEN IN THEIR COMPANY AND AS THEY ARE AFRAID OF SOLITUDE THEY TAKE WITH THEM EITHER THOSE WHO ARE NOT WELL ENOUGH OFF TO HAVE A CARRIAGE OR ONE OR ANOTHER OF THOSE ELEGANT ANCIENT LADIES WHOSE ELEGANCE IS A LITTLE INEXPLICABLE AND TO WHOM ONE CAN ALWAYS GO FOR INFORMATION IN REGARD TO THE WOMEN WHOM THEY ACCOMPANY
YOU WON'T FIND A CARRIAGE I WILL WALK BUT IT IS RAINING NO MATTER BUT MADAME WILL BE COMING BACK OR IF SHE DOESN'T COME IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH IN THE MORNING TO GO AND SEE WHAT HAS KEPT HER
BUT MARGUERITE HAD NOT BEEN WELL WHEN I LEFT HER
DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WILL
I TOOK IT
I MIGHT HAVE DIED AND HE NOT KNOWN IT
THEN WHEN I WAS TWENTY-ONE HE ADDED TO THIS LITTLE INCOME AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE OF FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS ASSURING ME THAT WITH EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I MIGHT LIVE VERY HAPPILY AT PARIS IF IN ADDITION TO THIS I WOULD MAKE A POSITION FOR MYSELF EITHER IN LAW OR MEDICINE
SHOOTING HAD BEGUN AND MY FATHER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE A DISTRACTION FOR ME
WHAT WAS PASSING IN MY MIND I SHOULD HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING
IT IS TOO LATE TO GET CHANGE NOW DON'T FORGET NO FEAR
NOW IF THERE IS ONE THING WHICH WOMEN IN SOCIETY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND THERE WERE SOCIETY WOMEN THERE IT IS THE HOME OF THOSE WOMEN WHOSE CARRIAGES SPLASH THEIR OWN CARRIAGES DAY BY DAY WHO LIKE THEM SIDE BY SIDE WITH THEM HAVE THEIR BOXES AT THE OPERA AND AT THE ITALIENS AND WHO PARADE IN PARIS THE OPULENT INSOLENCE OF THEIR BEAUTY THEIR DIAMONDS AND THEIR SCANDAL
ALL RIGHT
I TURNED THE LEAVES OVER AND THEN CLOSED THE BOOK FOR THE LETTERS SEEMED TO ME VOID OF MEANING THROUGH THE VEIL OF MY DOUBTS
7
HER EYES ARE ALREADY VEILED BY THE COMING OF DEATH
EITHER MARGUERITE WAS VERY CLEVER IN DECEPTION OR SHE HAD CONCEIVED FOR ME ONE OF THOSE SUDDEN PASSIONS WHICH ARE REVEALED IN THE FIRST KISS AND WHICH DIE OFTEN ENOUGH AS SUDDENLY AS THEY WERE BORN
I WAS AFRAID THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU OR THAT YOU WERE PERHAPS GOING TO SEE ANOTHER WOMAN CHILD NOW I AM RELIEVED
THE REST IS SOLD OR SEIZED
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE LIKES THEM SHE EATS NO OTHER KIND OF SWEETS
I READ AND REREAD THIS LETTER TEN TIMES OVER
I SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO THE MIDST OF THIS TUMULT SAD TO THINK OF WHEN ONE REMEMBERED THAT THE POOR CREATURE WHOSE GOODS WERE BEING SOLD TO PAY HER DEBTS HAD DIED IN THE NEXT ROOM
OFTEN A GIRL WHO HAS SOUGHT IN MARRIAGE ONLY THE UNION OF TWO PURE AFFECTIONS RECEIVES THE SUDDEN REVELATION OF PHYSICAL LOVE THAT ENERGETIC CONCLUSION OF THE PUREST IMPRESSIONS OF THE SOUL
HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
NANINE OPENED TO ME
NOWADAYS AT TWENTY-FIVE TEARS HAVE BECOME SO RARE A THING THAT THEY ARE NOT TO BE SQUANDERED INDISCRIMINATELY
IN OCTOBER WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN PARIS AND ALL WOULD HAVE COME OUT
ONLY I REGRET MY INABILITY TO CALM YOUR DISTRESS
IS SHE LIVING IN PARIS ALTOGETHER SHE WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO BOUGIVAL AFTER YOU WENT
FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY
I TOOK HIM BY THE ARM AND LED HIM ALONG
THE UPHOLSTERER WHOM THE DUKE HAD AGREED TO SETTLE WITH WAS SHOWN OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AND THE DUKE WROTE NEXT DAY TO SAY THAT HE WOULD ANSWER FOR NOTHING IN REGARD TO MLLE
WE SHOULD BE TOO UNHAPPY
YOU HAVE OF COURSE REALIZED THAT YOU CAN NOT ALWAYS LIVE LIKE THAT I FEAR SO FATHER BUT I HAVE NOT REALIZED IT BUT YOU MUST REALIZE CONTINUED MY FATHER IN A DRYER TONE THAT I AT ALL EVENTS SHOULD NOT PERMIT IT I HAVE SAID TO MYSELF THAT AS LONG AS I DID NOTHING CONTRARY TO THE RESPECT WHICH I OWE TO THE TRADITIONAL PROBITY OF THE FAMILY I COULD LIVE AS I AM LIVING AND THIS HAS REASSURED ME SOMEWHAT IN REGARD TO THE FEARS I HAVE HAD PASSIONS ARE FORMIDABLE ENEMIES TO SENTIMENT
SEEM NOT TO CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND HE WILL LET THINGS REMAIN AS THEY ARE
GAUTIER THAN OF ANY ONE ELSE MY DEAR FATHER HOW HAPPY YOU MAKE ME WE TALKED IN THIS MANNER FOR SOME MOMENTS AND THEN SAT DOWN TO TABLE
THIS THUNDER WEATHER GETS ON MY NERVES
AS FOR ME I NO LONGER REMEMBERED HOW I HAD LIVED BEFORE THAT NIGHT
THEY PRETEND NOT TO SEE ANYTHING AND WHEN THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT THEY GO THEIR WAY
HE SAW HER HOME
AN HOUR LATER I HELD MARGUERITE IN MY ARMS AND IF SHE HAD ASKED ME TO COMMIT A CRIME I WOULD HAVE OBEYED HER
WOMEN LIKE MARGUERITE ALWAYS FORESEE THAT SOME ONE WILL LOVE THEM NEVER THAT THEY WILL LOVE
HOW MANY WAYS DOES THE HEART TAKE HOW MANY REASONS DOES IT INVENT FOR ITSELF IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT IT WANTS
MY SELF-ESTEEM GOT THE UPPER HAND
I HAVE BEEN ILL THREE OR FOUR DAYS
ALL THE SAME I WISHED TO KNOW HER
AT LAST SHE FELL ASLEEP IN MY ARMS BUT IT WAS THE SLEEP WHICH TIRES RATHER THAN RESTS THE BODY
YOU ARE ILL
DON'T YOU SEE THAT MARGUERITE CAN'T TURN THE COUNT OUT OF DOORS
IF I WANT TO GO TO BED I DON'T MIND YOUR BEING HERE AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A RING
I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I SHALL NEVER BE MYSELF AGAIN UNTIL I HAVE SEEN MARGUERITE
HE DID SO AND TAKING HIS HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET HID HIS FACE IN IT FOR A MOMENT
SHE AGREED PUT ON HER CLOAK AND TOOK NANINE WITH HER SO AS NOT TO RETURN ALONE
I CONFESS THAT I WAS CURIOUS TO BE PRESENT AND I DID NOT SLEEP ALL NIGHT
SHE DID QUITE RIGHT AND I DON'T BEAR HER ANY GRUDGE
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE I WITHDREW FROM THE NOISE
BESIDES YOU DON'T MIND THE DUKE YES
SERIOUSLY BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY IT TO ME SOONER WHEN COULD I HAVE SAID IT THE DAY AFTER YOU HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO ME AT THE OPERA COMIQUE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ME VERY BADLY IF I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WHY BECAUSE I HAD BEHAVED SO STUPIDLY THAT'S TRUE
POOR GIRL I SAID TO MYSELF AS I RETURNED HOME
YOU ARE M
A FEW RECOLLECTIONS ARE EXCHANGED AND EVERYBODY'S LIFE GOES ON AS IF THE INCIDENT HAD NEVER OCCURRED WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A TEAR
WELL AND PRUDENCE SHE HAS NOT COME YET BUT I WILL SEND HER TO YOU MADAME THE MOMENT SHE COMES THERE'S ONE NOW MARGUERITE WENT ON AS SHE TOOK OFF HER DRESS AND PUT ON A WHITE DRESSING-GOWN THERE'S ONE WHO KNOWS VERY WELL HOW TO FIND ME WHEN SHE IS IN WANT OF ME AND YET SHE CAN'T DO ME A SERVICE DECENTLY
MARGUERITE HAD A MARVELLOUS PORTRAIT OF HERSELF BY VIDAL THE ONLY MAN WHOSE PENCIL COULD DO HER JUSTICE
AS A MATTER OF FACT EVERYTHING WENT TO PROVE THAT MARGUERITE LOVED ME
HE SAW THAT I PERCEIVED IT AND TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD
ISN'T THERE ANY ONE TO GO TO THE DOOR
BESIDES I SHOULD SIMPLY GO OUT OF MY MIND IF I WERE NOT TO CARRY OUT A RESOLUTION WHICH I HAVE SET MYSELF TO CARRY OUT
MY ANXIETY TIGHTENED ITS CIRCLE LITTLE BY LITTLE AND BEGAN TO OPPRESS MY HEAD AND HEART
I MUST TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
FEBRUARY 20 5 P.M
THEY MAKE ME HOPE THAT YOU HAVE THOUGHT OVER THINGS ON YOUR SIDE AS I HAVE ON MINE MAY I ASK YOU FATHER WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF YOUR REFLECTION THE RESULT MY DEAR BOY IS THAT I HAVE EXAGGERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO ME AND THAT I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO BE LESS SEVERE WITH YOU WHAT ARE YOU SAYING FATHER I CRIED JOYOUSLY
YOU HAVE A MISTRESS
DUVAL
DUVAL
SHE HARDLY TAKES ANY SLEEP SHE GOES TO ALL THE BALLS SHE GOES TO SUPPERS SHE EVEN DRINKS
I THINK OF YOU ARMAND
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY THIS OLD MAN WHO WAS NOW IMPLORING ME FOR THE FUTURE OF HIS SON WOULD BID HIS DAUGHTER MINGLE MY NAME WITH HER PRAYERS AS THE NAME OF A MYSTERIOUS FRIEND I SEEMED TO BECOME TRANSFORMED AND I FELT A PRIDE IN MYSELF
SHE WOULD DIE SOONER THAN REPLY WHAT CAN I DO THEN NOTHING
AGE AND SORROW WEIGH WITH A DOUBLE WEIGHT ON HIS WORN-OUT BODY
THE EYES WERE NOTHING BUT TWO HOLES THE LIPS HAD DISAPPEARED VANISHED AND THE WHITE TEETH WERE TIGHTLY SET
YOU FRIGHTENED ME SHE SAID
THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF-POSSESSION
AT THE THIRD ENTR'ACTE SHE TURNED AND SAID TWO WORDS
I AM HERE ARMAND SHE SAID
I CAN GIVE YOU NO IDEA OF THE DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AGITATED ME DURING THE HOUR IN WHICH I WAITED
A MODE OF REASONING WHICH PERMITS MANY WOMEN TO HAVE MANY LOVERS
SHE HAD ONLY JUST GOT IN
THINK OF THE FUTURE
BUT ONCE BACK IN PARIS IT SEEMED TO HER ACCUSTOMED TO A LIFE OF DISSIPATION OF BALLS OF ORGIES AS IF THE SOLITUDE ONLY INTERRUPTED BY THE DUKE'S STATED VISITS WOULD KILL HER WITH BOREDOM AND THE HOT BREATH OF HER OLD LIFE CAME BACK ACROSS HER HEAD AND HEART
JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
BUT SHE OFTEN WROTE LETTERS WHICH I NEVER ASKED TO SEE THOUGH EVERY TIME THEY CAME THEY SEEMED TO PREOCCUPY MARGUERITE DEEPLY
THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE
NEVERTHELESS THOUGH SHE WAS ONLY A KEPT WOMAN I HAD SO ANTICIPATED FOR MYSELF PERHAPS TO POETIZE IT A LITTLE A HOPELESS LOVE THAT THE NEARER THE MOMENT APPROACHED WHEN I SHOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE TO HOPE THE MORE I DOUBTED
I KNEW MLLE
NOW TELL ME WHAT IT WAS SHE WANTED TO SAY TO YOU LAST NIGHT NOTHING AT ALL
BUT HE IS VERY NICE WITH HER ALL THE SAME
YOU ARE GOOD YOUR SOUL HAS GENEROSITY UNKNOWN TO MANY WOMEN WHO PERHAPS DESPISE YOU AND ARE LESS WORTHY THAN YOU
I WAS TOLD TO SHOW YOU MLLE
AND ABOVE ALL TELL THEM NOT TO ADMIT ANYBODY BEFORE MIDDAY CHAPTER 12 AT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS THE LIGHT BEGAN TO APPEAR THROUGH THE CURTAINS MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
I FELT TWO GRATEFUL TEARS ON MY FOREHEAD LIKE THE BAPTISM OF MY PAST FAULTS AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN I CONSENTED TO GIVE MYSELF UP TO ANOTHER MAN I GLOWED WITH PRIDE AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT I WAS REDEEMING BY THIS NEW FAULT
THEY WOULD SEE ONLY ONE THING THAT ARMAND DUVAL ALLOWED A KEPT WOMAN FORGIVE ME MY CHILD FOR WHAT I AM FORCED TO SAY TO YOU TO SELL ALL SHE HAD FOR HIM
THE PROOF IS THAT AFTER MEETING YOU TO-DAY SHE CAME STRAIGHT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT
THIS ONE WAS DEAD SO THE MOST VIRTUOUS OF WOMEN COULD ENTER EVEN HER BEDROOM
TOWARD THE END OF SUPPER MARGUERITE WAS SEIZED BY A MORE VIOLENT FIT OF COUGHING THAN ANY SHE HAD HAD WHILE I WAS THERE
I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO ENDURE THE BLOW ALONE
THEN THEY BECOME OUR FRIENDS OR RATHER OUR GUESTS AT TABLE
MARGUERITE LOVES ME I AM SURE OF IT MY FATHER DID NOT ANSWER
THEN BESIDES THAT CONTINUED PRUDENCE
I AM YOURS AND THROWING OFF HER CLOAK AND HAT SHE FLUNG THEM ON THE SOFA AND BEGAN HURRIEDLY TO UNDO THE FRONT OF HER DRESS FOR BY ONE OF THOSE REACTIONS SO FREQUENT IN HER MALADY THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HER HEAD AND STIFLED HER
I LEFT EVERYTHING AFTER THAT
MONSIEUR ARMAND
IN AN INSTANT I HAD GAINED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED LOUIS WHICH I SPREAD OUT BEFORE ME ON THE TABLE AND ON WHICH SHE FASTENED HER EYES GREEDILY
I UNDRESSED HER WITHOUT HER MAKING A MOVEMENT AND CARRIED HER ICY COLD TO THE BED
HE WAS WRITING AND I SAW AT ONCE BY THE WAY IN WHICH HE RAISED HIS EYES TO ME WHEN I CAME IN THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION
DE N WITH A SMILE WHICH HE TRIED TO RENDER DELICATELY IRONICAL
AGAIN I ASKED MY PORTER IF THERE WAS A LETTER FOR ME
HER FACE CHANGED THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME
NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID MARGUERITE PROPOSED TO ME TO TAKE THE BOAT AND GO AS FAR AS THE ISLAND OF CROISSY
I GAVE MY NEW MISTRESS A CARRIAGE AND JEWELS
WILL YOU NOT COME BACK BEFORE I DIE
ONE DAY I WILL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY AND YOU WILL SEE IF I HAVE REASON FOR REGRETTING THE POOR GIRL
HAVE YOU SEEN JULIE DUPRAT YES I SAW HER THE DAY I RETURNED FOR THE FIRST TIME DID SHE GIVE YOU THE PAPERS THAT MARGUERITE HAD LEFT FOR YOU ARMAND DREW A ROLL OF PAPERS FROM UNDER HIS PILLOW AND IMMEDIATELY PUT THEM BACK
BUT DON'T GET ANY OTHER IDEAS INTO YOUR HEAD AND DON'T MAKE ABSURD SCENES OF JEALOUSY
THIS INCOME CAME FROM A MORTGAGE OF SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS ON A HOUSE THAT I HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN
EVERY DAY I HOPE VAGUELY FOR A LETTER FROM YOU BUT IT DOES NOT COME AND NO DOUBT IT WILL NEVER COME
YOU WILL BE COMPANY FOR HER AND YOU CAN STAY THE NIGHT
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EAGERLY I ACCEPTED
WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF THIS WOMAN LOVES ME IF HER WHOLE LIFE IS CHANGED THROUGH THE LOVE WHICH SHE HAS FOR ME AND THE LOVE WHICH I HAVE FOR HER
AT HALF PAST NINE A MESSENGER BROUGHT ME AN ENVELOPE CONTAINING MY LETTER AND THE FIVE-HUNDRED-FRANC NOTE NOT A WORD MORE
STILL THE CARRIAGE DID NOT RETURN
IT IS A SHAMEFUL THING TO SPEAK OF BUT WE ARE NOT TELLING TALES OF PLEASANT SINS
AH THAT IS YOUR IDEA OF HOSPITALITY SAID GASTON LAUGHING
THANKS HE SAID TAKING THE LETTERS
I NEEDED THE WHOLE OF NATURE TO UNBOSOM MYSELF
FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT
SHE WILL SEE YOU IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THE COUNT
I KNEW MARGUERITE
SCARCELY HAD I NOTICED THIS FACT WHEN LOOKING AROUND ME I SAW MARGUERITE ON FOOT ACCOMPANIED BY A WOMAN WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
WHO TOLD YOU I KNEW IT
AN AUTUMN RAIN LASHED THE WINDOWS
IS THIS HOW YOU KEEP YOUR PROMISE OF BLIND OBEDIENCE WHAT CAN I DO MARGUERITE
SO MY VANITY WAS WHISPERING TO ME ON THE BOULEVARDS WHEN I MET GASTON WHO ASKED ME WHERE I HAD BEEN
THAT IS IT INDEED HE SAID LOOKING AT THE INSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST PAGE AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES
HE DOES NOT KNOW THE WOMAN AND SHE HAS PLEASURES GRIEFS LOVES IN WHICH HE HAS NO PART
IF THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO GO IN FOR OUR HATEFUL BUSINESS ONLY KNEW WHAT IT REALLY WAS THEY WOULD SOONER BE CHAMBERMAIDS
SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU YOU KNOW AND SHE STILL IS
WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY WITH MME
I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL AND WAITED TILL SIX
BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT LET ME HAVE THAT KEY WHAT YOU ASK IS A THING I HAVE NEVER DONE FOR ANY ONE WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU WELL KEEP IT
I SAW THE FACES OF SOME PEOPLE I KNEW PASSING RAPIDLY JOYOUS AND CARELESS
BUT WHAT WAS NATURAL IN THEM WAS ON MY PART AN EFFORT AND THE NERVOUS LAUGHTER WHOSE SOURCE THEY DID NOT DETECT WAS NEARER TO TEARS THAN TO MIRTH
SHE IS WHITE SHE COUGHS--SHE WON'T LAST LONG NOW AND PRUDENCE HELD OUT HER HAND TO ME ADDING
I LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN THAT AUTOMATIC WAY
THEY WENT ALL THREE INTO THE BED-ROOM WHERE SO MANY STRANGE WORDS HAVE BEEN SAID BUT WAS NOW A SORT OF HOLY TABERNACLE
THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE
WELL I LOVED YOU ALL AT ONCE AS MUCH AS MY DOG
THE MIND ADMITS NEITHER WORK NOR REMEMBRANCE
I ONCE HAD A LITTLE DOG WHO LOOKED AT ME WITH A SAD LOOK WHEN I COUGHED
AS WE REACHED THE DOOR THAT YOU KNOW MY HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT I WAS HARDLY ABLE TO THINK
NOT IN THE LEAST
NEVERTHELESS HIS STEPS BECAME MORE IRREGULAR
FORTUNATELY THE COUNT HAD EXCELLENT MANNERS AND WAS VERY GOOD-TEMPERED
I WAS SO MISERABLE YESTERDAY THAT I WANTED TO SPEND THE EVENING WHICH SEEMED AS IF IT WERE GOING TO BE AS LONG AS THE LAST ANYWHERE BUT AT HOME
IT CONSISTED OF THESE WORDS
FEBRUARY 5
IF I WERE AT PARIS I WOULD COME AND ASK AFTER YOU MYSELF
CHAPTER 8 HOWEVER CONTINUED ARMAND AFTER A PAUSE WHILE I KNEW MYSELF TO BE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER I FELT MORE SURE OF MYSELF AND PART OF MY DESIRE TO SPEAK TO MARGUERITE AGAIN WAS A WISH TO MAKE HER SEE THAT I WAS STRONGER THAN SHE
IN THE SUMMER WE WILL GO INTO THE COUNTRY NOT TO A HOUSE LIKE THIS BUT TO A HOUSE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE
SHE LIKES YOU YOU ARE VERY FOND OF HER
I WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THE REASON OF THIS ASTONISHMENT AND ADMIRATION FOR HAVING BEGUN TO EXAMINE THINGS A LITTLE CAREFULLY I DISCOVERED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THAT I WAS IN THE HOUSE OF A KEPT WOMAN
AND NOW HE ADDED RUBBING HIS EYES FOR THE LAST TIME AND LOOKING AT HIMSELF IN THE GLASS SAY THAT YOU DO NOT THINK ME TOO ABSOLUTELY IDIOTIC AND ALLOW ME TO COME BACK AND SEE YOU ANOTHER TIME HE CAST ON ME A GENTLE AND AMIABLE LOOK
AND YOU ARE WRONG SO LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
MARGUERITE IN FACT AS I HAD FOUND FROM SOME FRIENDS WHO KNEW OF THE LAST CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER LIFE HAD NOT A SINGLE REAL FRIEND BY HER BEDSIDE DURING THE TWO MONTHS OF HER LONG AND PAINFUL AGONY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY INDOORS
ON LOOKING I SAW A WOMAN WITH WHOM I WAS QUITE FAMILIAR
MARGUERITE ISN'T A SAINT
DUVAL SAYS NOTHING
YOU WITH YOUR SEVEN OR EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WHAT COULD YOU DO TOWARD SUPPLYING ALL THE LUXURIES WHICH A GIRL LIKE THAT IS IN NEED OF
ANOTHER FEELING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME
SO WISHING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS POSSIBLE SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY
IF I MEET HER I THOUGHT I WILL PUT ON AN INDIFFERENT AIR AND SHE WILL BE CONVINCED THAT I NO LONGER THINK ABOUT HER AS I TURNED THE CORNER OF THE RUE ROYALE I SAW HER PASS IN HER CARRIAGE
AT ANOTHER MOMENT I WOULD RECALL HER PROMISES AND ENDEAVOUR TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT MY LETTER WAS ONLY TOO GENTLE AND THAT THERE WERE NOT EXPRESSIONS FORCIBLE ENOUGH TO PUNISH A WOMAN WHO LAUGHED AT A LOVE LIKE MINE
ARNOULD SHE IS CALLED MME
SHE PREFERS IT I COULD NOT STAY STILL
MARGUERITE GOT OUT AND WENT IN ALONE
I CAN VERY WELL PAY HER A CALL BUT ARMAND DOESN'T KNOW HER I WILL INTRODUCE HIM IMPOSSIBLE WE AGAIN HEARD MARGUERITE'S VOICE CALLING TO PRUDENCE WHO RUSHED TO HER DRESSING-ROOM WINDOW
OH HOW PETTY AND VILE IS MAN WHEN HE IS WOUNDED IN ONE OF HIS NARROW PASSIONS
HE KNOWS QUITE WELL THAT MARGUERITE IS NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM
JUST AS I WAS LEAVING HIM HE ONCE MORE BEGGED ME TO STAY
BUT I CAN NOT REPEAT TO YOU THE THOUSAND THOUGHTS THAT ROSE FROM MY HEART TO MY HEAD AND THAT ONLY FADED AWAY WITH THE SLEEP THAT CAME TO ME AT DAYBREAK
BUT THE GENUINE LOVE WHICH I HAD FOR MARGUERITE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMMODATING ITSELF TO SUCH A BELIEF
YES FOR YOU DON'T LAUGH
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO DO WITH THE WOMAN
BUT I AM TAKING UP YOUR TIME SIR WITH MY TALES AND IT WASN'T TO HEAR THEM YOU CAME HERE
IT WAS BURNING AND THE POOR WOMAN SHIVERED UNDER HER FUR CLOAK
HAS RETURNED
WE RETURNED TO PRUDENCE'S BOX AND WHEN THE PLAY WAS OVER WE TOOK A CAB AND DROVE TO 7 RUE D'ANTIN
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID THAT EVENING AFTER THE OPERA COMIQUE NO I WAITED FOR YOU AT THE DOOR OF THE CAFE ANGLAIS
IN THE EVENING SHE SEEMED A LITTLE CALMER AND MAKING ME SIT AT THE FOOT OF THE BED SHE TOLD ME MANY TIMES HOW MUCH SHE LOVED ME
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SUCH A THING HAD OCCURRED TO ME
WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THE HOLD WHICH THIS WOMAN HAD TAKEN UPON MY LIFE
THE EYE IS BUT A POINT AND IT COVERS LEAGUES
IS THERE AND HE HAS GIVEN ORDERS TO LET NO ONE IN QUITE SO I STAMMERED
I KNEW AN AGED WOMAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN GAY WHOSE ONLY LINK WITH THE PAST WAS A DAUGHTER ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN
HE WISHED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM
I HAD PUT MY ARMS ABOUT HER WAIST AND I FELT HER SUPPLE BODY WEIGH LIGHTLY ON MY CLASPED HANDS
LIFE IS PLEASANT MY DEAR FELLOW
HAVE YOU NO PARENTS NO FRIENDS
I STOOD ASIDE AND WITHOUT BEING SEEN SAW THE TWO WOMEN PASS ME ACCOMPANIED BY TWO YOUNG MEN
PERHAPS SHE WILL HAVE GOT IT ALREADY AND IT WOULD LOOK AS IF I HAVE REPENTED OF SENDING IT AS THE HOUR AT WHICH IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT SHE WOULD REPLY CAME NEARER I REGRETTED MORE AND MORE THAT I HAD WRITTEN
YOUR LETTER UNDECEIVED ME
SHE WAS PALE AS MARBLE
HAD IT NOT BEEN AN EXCEPTION IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORTH THE TROUBLE OF WRITING IT
WELL WHAT NEWS HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME NONE EXCEPT THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE COME TO-NIGHT WHY BECAUSE YOU SEEM VEXED AND NO DOUBT I AM BORING YOU YOU ARE NOT BORING ME
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF
MY SOLICITOR
THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT WHY BECAUSE SHE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF A JEALOUS OLD DUKE PROTECTION IS CHARMING YES PROTECTION REPLIED PRUDENCE
YOU ALWAYS SAY SOMETHING RIDICULOUS WOMEN ARE PITILESS TOWARD THOSE WHOM THEY DO NOT CARE FOR
HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE
THERE'S A MAN WHO SEEMS TO ME TO UNDERSTAND LOVE AS I UNDERSTAND IT
BUT WE HAVE OTHER POOR GIRLS HERE JUST LIKE HER AND JUST HER AGE AND THEY ARE JUST THROWN INTO A PAUPER'S GRAVE AND IT BREAKS MY HEART WHEN I HEAR THEIR POOR BODIES DROP INTO THE EARTH
THAT'S SETTLED
THE RECOLLECTION OF THIS VISION FOR IT WAS REALLY A VISION WOULD NOT LEAVE MY MIND LIKE SO MANY VISIONS I HAD SEEN AND I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR THIS ROYALLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN WHITE
I GAVE ORDERS TO ASK HIM IN AT ONCE
THE GROUND HERE WAS ONLY BOUGHT FOR FIVE YEARS AND THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN WANTS A PERPETUAL LEASE AND A BIGGER PLOT OF GROUND
I CAN WRITE TO YOU THEN TO-DAY
I BECAME A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL A THING WITHOUT A THOUGHT
I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
ALL I KNOW IS THAT SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AS SHE KISSED AN INFANT ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD FROM WHOM HER ARREST WAS TO SEPARATE HER
I AM USED TO IT NOW YOU ARE KILLING YOURSELF MADAME I SAID TO HER IN A MOVED VOICE
TAKING IT ALL ROUND WITH FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR HE CAN NOT GIVE A WOMAN MORE THAN FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS IN THE YEAR AND THAT IS ALREADY A GOOD DEAL
WELL SAID GASTON WHEN WE WERE IN THE STREET WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARGUERITE SHE IS AN ANGEL AND I AM MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER SO I GUESSED
THE POLICE INSPECTOR WAS THERE ALREADY
I REMAINED FOR SOME TIME IN THEIR HAPPY FAMILY FULL OF INDULGENT CARE FOR ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM THE CONVALESCENCE OF HIS HEART
WON'T YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO TREAT ME AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND GO ON OH SAID SHE FLINGING HERSELF ON THE SOFA AND MOTIONING TO US TO SIT DOWN GASTON KNOWS WHAT MY MUSIC IS LIKE
AT FIVE O'CLOCK WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO I WENT TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
I REPLIED THAT I HAD BEEN TRAVELLING FOR A SHORT TIME AND BEGGED HIM TO LET ME KNOW BEFOREHAND WHAT DAY HE WOULD ARRIVE SO THAT I COULD BE THERE TO MEET HIM
IT IS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND DURING THE TEN YEARS THAT HE HAS HAD IT HE HAS PAID OFF THE SECURITY AND PUT ASIDE A DOWRY FOR MY SISTER
BUT WHEN TOWARD NINE O'CLOCK I HEARD A RING THEY THRONGED TOGETHER INTO ONE SUCH EMOTION THAT AS I OPENED THE DOOR I WAS OBLIGED TO LEAN AGAINST THE WALL TO KEEP MYSELF FROM FALLING
SUPPOSING ONE DAY I SHOULD BECOME YOUR MISTRESS YOU ARE BOUND TO KNOW THAT I HAVE HAD OTHER LOVERS BESIDES YOU
YOU ARE RELIEVED AREN'T YOU
I WATCHED THE CLOUDS PASS
THE VOICE OF THE AUCTIONEER COULD BE HEARD FROM THE OUTER DOOR
THIS LIAISON WHOSE MOTIVE AND ORIGIN WERE QUITE UNKNOWN CAUSED A GREAT SENSATION FOR THE DUKE ALREADY KNOWN FOR HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE NOW BECAME KNOWN FOR HIS PRODIGALITY
THE WEATHER WAS FINE THE GRAVES WERE NOT LIKELY TO LOOK AS SAD AND DESOLATE AS THEY DO IN WINTER
SHE ACCEPTED OF COURSE IN THE END AND AT MIDDAY I LEFT HER HOUSE AS HER LOVER
BUT HE SAID NOTHING SEALED THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD JUST WRITTEN AND GAVE IT TO JOSEPH TO POST
IT IS REALLY NOT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO ALARM YOURSELF SHE REPLIED IN A SOMEWHAT BITTER TONE
YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR MISTRESS I AM VERY SORRY TO DISOBEY YOU FATHER BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE I WILL COMPEL YOU TO DO SO UNFORTUNATELY FATHER THERE NO LONGER EXISTS A SAINTE MARGUERITE TO WHICH COURTESANS CAN BE SENT AND EVEN IF THERE WERE I WOULD FOLLOW MLLE
DUVAL TO SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE
STUPID INDEED HE IS
I MUST SEE WHAT GOD HAS DONE WITH A BEING THAT I HAVE LOVED SO MUCH AND PERHAPS THE HORROR OF THE SIGHT WILL CURE ME OF MY DESPAIR
SO MUCH THE BETTER
AND YET I WAS BOUND TO EXPECT SUCH A THING ALMOST ANY DAY WITH MARGUERITE AND IT HAD HAPPENED TO ME OFTEN ENOUGH WITH MY OTHER MISTRESSES WITHOUT MY TAKING MUCH NOTICE OF IT
MY GOD
MY GOD
MY GOD
MY GOD
I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WISH IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD DO AS SHE HAD PLANNED
THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD FOUND MARGUERITE SAD
NOTHING THAT DAME FROM HER WAS INDIFFERENT TO ME
I SAW THAT THIS VOLUME HAD BEEN BOUGHT BY YOU AND I DECIDED TO ASK YOU TO GIVE IT UP TO ME THOUGH THE PRICE YOU HAD SET UPON IT MADE ME FEAR THAT YOU MIGHT YOURSELF HAVE SOME SOUVENIR IN CONNECTION WITH THE POSSESSION OF THE BOOK AS HE SPOKE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS AFRAID I HAD KNOWN MARGUERITE AS HE HAD KNOWN HER
FOOL THAT I AM
SHE DID NOT SPEAK A WORD BUT SMILED AT ME
YOU WILL HAVE PITY ON ME WON'T YOU
THIS MORNING MARGUERITE WAS STIFLING
BUT IT ONLY DEPENDS ON ME TO MAKE IT USELESS TO YOU AFTER ALL HOW THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH I WILL HAVE THEM TAKEN OFF YOU LOVE THEN A LITTLE I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
MADLY GO THEN AND HE PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD AS IF TO CHASE A THOUGHT THEN OPENED HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SAY SOMETHING
PRUDENCE CLOSED THE WINDOW
I ASKED THE PORTER IF MLLE
PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
AND BEFORE LEAVING HE TOOK A VERY HEAVY LETTER ADDRESSED TO HIS FATHER AND NO DOUBT CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THAT NIGHT'S IMPRESSIONS
ALL THAT YOU HAD IN THE HOUSE SHE HESITATED
SHE LIVED A SINNER AND SHE WILL DIE A CHRISTIAN A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD HE RETURNED WITH A CHOIR BOY BEARING A CRUCIFIX AND A SACRISTAN WHO WENT BEFORE THEM RINGING THE BELL TO ANNOUNCE THAT GOD WAS COMING TO THE DYING ONE
I WAS PREPARED FOR EVERY STRUGGLE EVEN WITH MY FATHER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT KEEP MARGUERITE
GAUTIER'S GRAVE
SOMETHING OR OTHER AT ONCE
AND WHY INDEED SHOULD GOD WHO HAD MADE HER WITHOUT STRENGTH HAVE LEFT HER WITHOUT CONSOLATION UNDER THE SORROWFUL BURDEN OF HER LIFE
TWENTY TIMES I WAS ON THE POINT OF SENDING TO GET THE LETTER BACK BUT EVERY TIME I SAID TO MYSELF
IT IS WHAT I FEEL AT LEAST SO YOU WOULD LOOK AFTER ME YES YOU WOULD STAY BY ME ALL DAY YES
I TRIED TO PERSUADE MYSELF OF THE FEELINGS WHICH IT PROFESSED
I WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY AT THAT POINT IN REGARD TO MARGUERITE FOR I HAD SEEN AND MET HER I KNEW HER BY SIGHT AND BY REPUTATION
FOR THE REST IT WAS NO CREDIT TO ME TO HAVE GOT THE BETTER OF THIS RECOLLECTION FOR I HAD COMPLETELY LOST SIGHT OF MARGUERITE AND AS I TOLD YOU WHEN SHE PASSED ME IN THE CORRIDOR OF THE VARIETES I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER
I WAS BEGINNING TO ASK MYSELF IF WHEN HE HAD COME TO SEE ME THE RECENT NEWS OF MARGUERITE'S DEATH HAD NOT EXAGGERATED HIS FORMER LOVE AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS SORROW AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT PERHAPS HE HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN THE DEAD WOMAN AND ALONG WITH HER HIS PROMISE TO COME AND SEE ME AGAIN
BUT HE STILL WATCHED HIS EYES FIXED AND WIDE OPEN LIKE THE EYES OF A MADMAN AND A SLIGHT TREMBLING OF THE CHEEKS AND LIPS WERE THE ONLY SIGNS OF THE VIOLENT NERVOUS CRISIS UNDER WHICH HE WAS SUFFERING
I HAD HAD TO DO WITH A WOMAN LIKE ALL OTHER WOMEN OF THE KIND
I ONLY MEANT THAT SINCE YOU ARE AT PARIS IS SHE NOT COMING TO JOIN YOU NO I LOOKED AT PRUDENCE
I OPENED THE DOOR AND ENTERED
BUT I SAW PRUDENCE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND YES HOW COULD I DISOBEY
FOR A WHOLE MONTH THERE WAS NOT A DAY WHEN MARGUERITE HAD NOT EIGHT OR TEN PEOPLE TO MEALS
I USED EVERY MEANS TO MAKE HER CONFESS THE REAL CAUSE OF HER DISTRESS BUT SHE PERSISTED IN GIVING ME NOTHING BUT VAGUE REASONS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU
OLYMPE PASSED ME IN AN ELEGANT CARRIAGE THAT M
AND I WENT TO MY FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD BEEN CALLED TO PARIS ON BUSINESS BUT THAT I SHOULD RETURN PROMPTLY
IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO BECOME SO
HE MUST BE CONFIDING SUBMISSIVE AND DISCREET WELL I WILL BE ALL THAT YOU WISH WE SHALL SEE WHEN SHALL WE SEE LATER ON WHY BECAUSE SAID MARGUERITE RELEASING HERSELF FROM MY ARMS AND TAKING FROM A GREAT BUNCH OF RED CAMELLIAS A SINGLE CAMELLIA SHE PLACED IT IN MY BUTTONHOLE BECAUSE ONE CAN NOT ALWAYS CARRY OUT AGREEMENTS THE DAY THEY ARE SIGNED AND WHEN SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN I SAID CLASPING HER IN MY ARMS
THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE BEEN TO SEE MARGUERITE'S SISTER YES
HE IS A GOOD FRIEND
HE PREFERRED TO ABANDON A CONFLICT WHICH COULD ONLY HAVE RESULTED IN MAKING ME PAY TEN TIMES ITS PRICE FOR THE VOLUME AND BOWING HE SAID VERY GRACEFULLY THOUGH INDEED A LITTLE LATE
WHAT HAVE I DONE MY DEAR MARGUERITE MY DEAR FRIEND YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING
THE HOPE OF GETTING BETTER WAS ONLY A DREAM
NOT A WINDOW IN THE HOUSE WAS LIGHTED UP AND WHEN I RANG NO ONE ANSWERED THE BELL
MANON TO MARGUERITE
SALON ANTEROOM AND BED-ROOM AT SIXTY FRANCS A MONTH
AFTER THE CONTREDANSE I WENT UP TO THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE WHO DISPLAYED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER GUESTS A DAZZLING BOSOM AND MAGNIFICENT SHOULDERS
FOR THE REST CONTINUED PRUDENCE I NEVER SAW HER AS SHE IS NOW
I WAS AT THE THEATRE BY SEVEN
I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED TO MY DISADVANTAGE THAN THUS FORGOTTEN
THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
I WAS DYING OF ENNUI AND IF ONE IS BOUND TO BE CONSUMED IT IS AS WELL TO THROW ONESELF INTO THE FLAMES AS TO BE ASPHYXIATED WITH CHARCOAL
SHE SEEMS MUCH CHANGED FOR I DID NOT RECOGNISE HER I SAID WITH AN EMOTION THAT YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND
WE WATER THEM EVERY DAY
FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER MARGUERITE AND HER FRIEND LEFT THE BOX
I WAS THE GAINER IN SO FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I CARED FOR AND I STILL WAITED
HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
FORGIVE ME IF I SEND YOU AWAY
BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
I HAVE OFTEN BEEN IN THE COUNTRY BUT NEVER AS I SHOULD LIKE TO GO THERE
DON'T BE SHY SAY ANYTHING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD YES YES I STAMMERED AND I FOLLOWED HIM SAYING TO MYSELF THAT I SHOULD SOON CURE MYSELF OF MY PASSION
I WENT UP TO HIM
ALL THAT I REMEMBER IS THAT ON THAT DAY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK HE TOOK ME WITH HIM IN A POST-CHAISE
I COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THESE INTERMITTENT PAROXYSMS OF DISTRESS WHICH WENT ON TILL MORNING
DON'T BE ALARMED
WHAT WOULD BE THE GOOD OF GETTING WELL
TELL THE COACHMAN TO WAIT AT THE DOOR OF THE CAFE ANGLAIS SAID MARGUERITE
BUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW HER COME WITH ME
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAW ME SPITTING BLOOD YOU TOOK MY HAND
TAKE MARGUERITE FOR WHAT SHE IS FOR A GOOD BRIGHT PRETTY GIRL
THE MEMORY OF HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH MADE HIM WEEP NO DOUBT
SHE WILL NEVER LIVE TO BE OLD AND I SHOULD SOME DAY BE SORRY FOR NOT HAVING DONE FOR HER THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED OF ME SUCH AN EASY THING TO DO WHAT COULD I REPLY TO SUCH WORDS ESPECIALLY WITH THE MEMORY OF A FIRST NIGHT OF LOVE AND IN THE EXPECTATION OF A SECOND
IT MUST HAVE COST HIM AT LEAST THREE THOUSAND FRANCS I AM SURE AND MME
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE SHE SAID EXACTLY LIKE A CHILD THAT I CAN NOT SUCCEED IN PLAYING THAT PASSAGE
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN I FANCIED THAT SOME CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH I COULD NOT RECOLLECT HAD OBLIGED ME TO SPEND THE NIGHT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE BUT THAT IF I RETURNED TO BOUGIVAL I SHOULD FIND HER AGAIN AS ANXIOUS AS I HAD BEEN AND THAT SHE WOULD ASK ME WHAT HAD DETAINED ME AWAY FROM HER SO LONG
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED I HAD ALWAYS ENOUGH TO LIVE ON
I SUFFERED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE INJURY TO SO FRAIL A CONSTITUTION WHICH MUST COME FROM DAILY EXCESSES LIKE THIS
VERY PRETTY TOO I BELIEVE
I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
I EVEN CAME TO ASK YOU MY DEAR PRUDENCE IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO THIS EVENING TO GO AND SEE MARGUERITE
PRUDENCE REMAINED BEHIND
I TRIED SUBLIME CHILDISHNESS OF LOVE TO STRING TOGETHER THE WORDS I SHOULD SAY TO HER
WELL-TO-DO FOLK WHO COME TO SEE THEIR DEAD FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND BRING THEIR FLOWERS THEMSELVES AND WHAT FLOWERS
ARMAND UNABLE TO TURN AWAY HIS EYES HAD PUT THE HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS MOUTH AND BIT IT
A YOUNG MAN WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE
OUR LOVE IS NOT LIKE OTHER LOVES MY ARMAND
SHE HAD TREATED ME LIKE A SCHOOL-BOY SHE HAD USED IN DECEIVING ME A TRICK WHICH WAS INSULTINGLY SIMPLE
BUT I MUST
FOR ME TO BE YOUR MISTRESS
IT ISN'T GENEROUS FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND SHE SAID GIVING ME HER HAND
PERHAPS THE DAYLIGHT WOULD FIND ME WITH THE SAME UNCERTAINTY AND WITH THE SAME FEARS
BY THE WAY WHAT IS YOUR FRIEND CALLED
I MUST GO TO BED SO YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GO
I AM DYING AND FROM MY BED I CAN HEAR A MAN WALKING TO AND FRO IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL
HE IS A MAN WHO IS USEFUL TO HER NOTHING MORE
IT WAS THEREFORE THIS SENTIMENT WHICH I MUST AFFECT NOT ONLY IN HER EYES BUT IN THE EYES OF OTHERS
IT WAS EARLY IN THE DAY AND YET THERE WERE ALREADY A NUMBER OF VISITORS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THE WOMEN THOUGH THEY WERE DRESSED IN CASHMERE AND VELVET AND HAD THEIR CARRIAGES WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR GAZED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND ADMIRATION AT THE LUXURY WHICH THEY SAW BEFORE THEM
DID YOU NOT PROMISE ME THAT I MIGHT COME AND SEE YOU TO-DAY QUITE RIGHT
FAR FROM IT
HER CASHMERE REACHED TO THE GROUND AND SHOWED ON EACH SIDE THE LARGE FLOUNCES OF A SILK DRESS AND THE HEAVY MUFF WHICH SHE HELD PRESSED AGAINST HER BOSOM WAS SURROUNDED BY SUCH CUNNINGLY ARRANGED FOLDS THAT THE EYE HOWEVER EXACTING COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH THE CONTOUR OF THE LINES
I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME
I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
NOT ONLY PERMIT BUT I BEG OF YOU SHE TURNED BACK THE COVERING AND GOT INTO BED
YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
SEE READ THIS LETTER AND HE HANDED TO ME A PAPER WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MANY TIMES REREAD
THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR A RICH OLD MAN LIKE THE DUKE BUT IT IS VERY BAD FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU AND THE PROOF OF IT IS THAT ALL THE YOUNG LOVERS I HAVE HAD HAVE VERY SOON LEFT ME I DID NOT ANSWER
THE PIANO WAS SILENT
FOR YOU SEE IF YOU WANT TO MOVE A BODY FROM ONE GRAVE TO ANOTHER YOU MUST HAVE IT IDENTIFIED AND ONLY THE FAMILY CAN GIVE LEAVE FOR IT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF A POLICE INSPECTOR
HE STAMMERED OUT DISCONNECTED WORDS IN WHICH ONLY THE NAME OF MARGUERITE COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD
I HAVE LIVED WITH THESE WOMEN FOR TWENTY YEARS
WE WENT OUT DURING ONE OF THE ENTR'ACTES AND A TALL WOMAN PASSED US IN THE CORRIDOR TO WHOM MY FRIEND BOWED
HUMILITY
I REMEMBER
PRUDENCE NEXT TOOK HER PLACE IN THE BOX AND A MAN WHOM I RECOGNISED AS THE COMTE DE G SEATED HIMSELF AT THE BACK
WHY WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE SHE SAID SITTING DOWN BY MY SIDE AGAIN
EVEN THE GRAVE-DIGGER DREW BACK
IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER WHILE YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE OBLIGED TO LEAVE HER
I WAS QUITE READY TO FORGIVE HER FOR SUCH REGRETS
NO ONE WILL KNOW WHO I AM
COMING BACK YES
THAT IS QUITE ENOUGH
PRUDENCE IS A CHATTERBOX
ONE REGRETS HAVING CAST SCRAPS OF ONE'S HEART TO OTHER WOMEN AND ONE CAN NOT BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF EVER PRESSING ANOTHER HAND THAN THAT WHICH ONE HOLDS BETWEEN ONE'S HANDS
BUT THOUGH I WERE TO BECOME A TRAPPIST LIKE M
TWENTY TIMES I WAS ON THE POINT OF NOT GOING
SHE KNOWS I AM WAITING FOR AN ANSWER
VERY WELL SIR HE SAID I KNOW WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE HE RANG AND JOSEPH APPEARED
SHE HAD REPURCHASED HER HORSES FOR THE CARRIAGE WAS JUST AS I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SEE IT BUT SHE WAS NOT IN IT
THE SKY WAS COVERED WITH CLOUDS
TILL THIS EVENING I SAID TO MARGUERITE AS I LEFT HER
YOU ARE QUITE WHITE
COULD AN HONEST MAN CARRY OUT SUCH A PROCEDURE WITHOUT WARNING ME
EYE-WITNESSES OF THE GREATER PART OF THE FACTS WHICH I HAVE COLLECTED ARE TO BE FOUND IN PARIS AND I MIGHT CALL UPON THEM TO CONFIRM ME IF MY TESTIMONY IS NOT ENOUGH
SHE IS TO MARRY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
WELL WHAT AM TO DO IN RETURN LOVE ME A LITTLE I SAID MY HEART BEATING SO THAT I COULD HARDLY SPEAK
THE DUKE SENT YESTERDAY TO INQUIRE AFTER ME AND THIS MORNING HE CAME TO SEE ME
VERY ELEGANT ALI
ONLY THE SOUND OF THE BELL TROUBLED THE SILENCE WITH ITS MONOTONOUS AND RHYTHMICAL STROKE
MARGUERITE HAD NOT ANSWERED
I AM READY TO FORGIVE YOU AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE AND YOU LOVE ME MADLY IN SPITE OF MY BAD DISPOSITION IN SPITE OF ALL YOU SWEAR IT YES I SAID IN A WHISPER
WE SEE SOMETHING OF THAT EVERY DAY
HOW CAN I THANK YOU FOR IT BY ALLOWING ME TO COME AND SEE YOU FROM TIME TO TIME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE FROM FIVE TO SIX AND FROM ELEVEN TO TWELVE
I HAVE BEEN VERY ILL I KNOW WHO TOLD YOU EVERY ONE KNEW IT
AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
WHEN I REFLECTED THAT AFTER THE BALL SHE WOULD GO HOME NOT WITH ME BUT WITH THAT RICH FOOL WHEN I THOUGHT OF WHAT WOULD FOLLOW THEIR RETURN THE BLOOD ROSE TO MY FACE AND I FELT THE NEED OF DOING SOMETHING TO TROUBLE THEIR RELATIONS
COME SAID I WITHOUT BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH TELL ME FRANKLY WHERE ARE MARGUERITE'S HORSES SOLD THE SHAWL SOLD THE DIAMONDS PAWNED AND WHO HAS SOLD AND PAWNED THEM WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME BECAUSE MARGUERITE MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO AND WHY DID YOU NOT ASK ME FOR MONEY BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T LET ME AND WHERE HAS THIS MONEY GONE IN PAYMENTS IS SHE MUCH IN DEBT THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS OR THEREABOUTS
IN MARGUERITE'S CASE IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT
HE TOLD THE DOCTOR THAT THE SIGHT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
IF SHE HAD ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT MY THOUGHTS OF VENGEANCE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED AND I SHOULD HAVE FALLEN AT HER FEET
I WAS CAREFUL NOT TO REFER TO MARGUERITE FEARING LEST THE NAME SHOULD AWAKEN SAD RECOLLECTIONS HIDDEN UNDER THE APPARENT CALM OF THE INVALID
LIGHT M
WHY HAD SHE SAID NOTHING TO NANINE OR WHY HAD SHE NOT WRITTEN
ARE YOU GOING ALREADY NO SAID I HOLDING HER HANDS
IT WAS MY ONLY MEANS OF MAKING UP MY MIND ABOUT HER
LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU ASK HER IF YOU MAY REALLY THERE IS NO NEED TO BE PARTICULAR WITH HER
THE KEEPER CALLED OVER A GARDENER TO WHOM HE GAVE THE NECESSARY INSTRUCTIONS
THAT IS A VICTORY OF INFINITELY GREATER DIFFICULTY
I WILL SELL ALL THAT I HAVE
THEN AS FOR TAKING CARE OF ONESELF THAT IS ALL VERY WELL FOR WOMEN WITH FAMILIES AND FRIENDS
THOSE OF US WHO ARE LIKE ME WHEN WE HAVE ANY HEART AT ALL WE GIVE A MEANING AND A DEVELOPMENT TO WORDS AND THINGS UNKNOWN TO OTHER WOMEN
9
HE SHOOTS HAS FRIENDS OFTEN HE IS MARRIED HE HAS CHILDREN HE RACES GAMBLES TRAVELS AND WHAT NOT
I FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE IN WHICH YOU AND YOUR THREE FRIENDS WERE AND WHEN I SAW YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE TO GET DOWN AND THAT YOU WENT IN ALONE I WAS VERY HAPPY MARGUERITE BEGAN TO LAUGH
DUVERNOY HAS BEEN HERE SAID NANINE AS SHE SAW US ENTER
SHE IS AS NOBLE AS THE NOBLEST OF WOMEN
I THINK I HAVE DONE ALL THAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF ME NO MY FRIEND IT IS NOT ENOUGH
TELL MY COACHMAN SHE SAID TO GO BACK WITH THE CARRIAGE I WENT DOWN MYSELF AND SENT HIM AWAY
BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME
I WANTED TO USE MY LAST RESOURCES TO PUT A STOP TO IT BUT THE BAILIFF TOLD ME IT WAS NO USE AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER SEIZURES TO FOLLOW
NO ONE HAD CALLED
LOVE ALWAYS MAKES A MAN BETTER NO MATTER WHAT WOMAN INSPIRES IT
I MUST SPEAK TO YOU TO-MORROW SHE SAID
SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN VERY PRETTY
I WILL HAVE NO SUCH SCANDALOUS DOINGS IN MY FAMILY
AT THAT TIME I HAD AS MISTRESS A VERY AFFECTIONATE AND SENTIMENTAL LITTLE PERSON WHOSE SENTIMENT AND WHOSE MELANCHOLY LETTERS AMUSED ME GREATLY
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING MORE SHALL I LOCK THE DOOR I SHOULD THINK SO
FORTUNATELY THE PHYSICAL MALADY WILL KILL THE MENTAL ONE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME HE WILL BE FREE FROM THE ONE AND PERHAPS FROM THE OTHER CHAPTER 7 ILLNESSES LIKE ARMAND'S HAVE ONE FORTUNATE THING ABOUT THEM
ON THE 12TH OF MARCH 1847 I SAW IN THE RUE LAFITTE A GREAT YELLOW PLACARD ANNOUNCING A SALE OF FURNITURE AND CURIOSITIES
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
I MADE UP MY MIND
IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE
IT IS IN VAIN THAT I SAY TO HER FROM TIME TO TIME MY DEAR CHILD THERE'S THE MAN FOR YOU SHE WHO GENERALLY LISTENS TO ME TURNS HER BACK AND REPLIES THAT HE IS TOO STUPID
FOR MY PART I AM DYING OF HUNGER MARGUERITE RANG THE BELL SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO AGAIN AND BEGAN TO HUM OVER A VERY RISKY SONG WHICH SHE ACCOMPANIED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU I CONTINUED BUT YOU MUST SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL MARGUERITE THAT I HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU DON'T BE AFRAID AND IF SHE SENDS YOU ANYTHING ELSE TO SELL OR PAWN LET ME KNOW THERE IS NO DANGER
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE DEBAUCHES MAPPED OUT BY HER MOTHER IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF GOD HAD LEFT OVER FOR HER ONE HAPPINESS
HE MERELY KISSED MARGUERITE'S HAND WHICH SHE HELD OUT TO HIM CARELESSLY ENOUGH AND BOWING TO US WENT OUT
BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES RECOVERING HERSELF A LITTLE SHE SAID TO ME
WHERE ARE YOU GOING SIR ASKED THE PORTER WHEN HE HAD OPENED TO ME
IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS
I LOOKED AT THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF THE THEATRES FOR I HAD STILL A CHANCE OF SEEING HER
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED MAY YET HAPPEN
HE WAS A VERY GOOD SORT OF FELLOW BUT SOMEWHAT SPOILED BY THE HABITS OF HIS YOUTH
I TOOK THEM AND RETURNED
WITH THE HELP OF HIS SERVANT I PUT HIM TO BED LIT A BIG FIRE IN HIS ROOM AND HURRIED OFF TO MY DOCTOR TO WHOM I TOLD ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED
THE SILENCE OF THE COUNTRY SEEMED TO BE CONTINUED HERE
I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH A NOD OF THE HEAD
ONLY REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE SOMETIMES IN LIFE CRUEL NECESSITIES FOR THE HEART BUT THAT THEY MUST BE SUBMITTED TO
I HAD BEEN HER LOVER FOR ONLY TWENTY-FOUR
YOU HAVE THE MOST CHARMING MISTRESS IN PARIS
AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME HE WOULD SUFFER TOO CRUELLY IF HE HAD TO LEAVE ME SO MUCH AS AN HOUR A DAY
THE FUTURE APPEARED AS I HAD LONG DESIRED TO SEE IT
TO TAKE CAPTIVE A HEART WHICH HAS HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF ATTACK IS TO ENTER AN UNFORTIFIED AND UNGARRISONED CITY
I OPEN IT AND FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME I LIVE OVER AGAIN WITH THE HEROINE OF THE ABBE PREVOST
HOW CAN I SEE HER AGAIN THAT CAN'T BE DONE UNLESS THERE IS A CHANGE OF GRAVE AND I TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT THE FORMALITIES THAT HAVE TO BE ATTENDED TO IN GETTING IT DONE
I WENT TO MARGUERITE'S ROOM
PRUDENCE HAS TOLD YOU HAS SHE NOT HOW I WENT TO ALL THE FETES AND BALLS AND ORGIES
I SHALL DIE AS SOON AS I HAVE CONFESSED
THEN WHEN GOD ALLOWS LOVE TO A COURTESAN THAT LOVE WHICH AT FIRST SEEMS LIKE A PARDON BECOMES FOR HER ALMOST WITHOUT PENITENCE
AND NOT A SOUL THINKS ABOUT THEM ANY MORE ONCE THEY ARE DEAD
I AM NOT THE APOSTLE OF VICE BUT I WOULD GLADLY BE THE ECHO OF NOBLE SORROW WHEREVER I BEAR ITS VOICE IN PRAYER
MARGUERITE ALONE AT BAGNERES WITH HER MAID AND NOT BEING IN ANY FEAR OF COMPROMISING HERSELF GRANTED THE DUKE'S REQUEST
THEY WILL CONSOLE YOU
I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
BESIDES I HAVE NOT SUCH A LONG TIME TO LIVE THAT I NEED MAKE MYSELF MISERABLE IN ORDER TO PLEASE AN OLD MAN WHOSE VERY SIGHT MAKES ME FEEL OLD
WHERE IS IT NOW
PERHAPS SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER
I TOO SHOULD NOT LIKE YOU TO BE ABLE IN A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE BORED OR WORRIED TO THINK THAT IF YOU WERE LIVING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE THOSE MOMENTS WOULD NOT EXIST
IN THE MIDST OF THESE THOUGHTS I FELL ASLEEP
YOU WILL FALL OUT WITH YOUR FATHER CRIPPLE YOUR RESOURCES AND ONE DOESN'T FIND THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER
I AM NOT USED TO EMOTIONS OF THIS KIND AND I AM IN A STATE OF CONSTANT FRIGHT
A FEW MINUTES AFTER A MORE RAPID BREATHING TOLD ME THAT ARMAND SLEPT BUT THAT LIGHT SLEEP WHICH THE LEAST SOUND BANISHES
MEN WHO BUY LOVE EXAMINE THE GOODS BEFORE TAKING THEM
YOU HAVE MADE ME VERY HAPPY BY GIVING ME THIS BOOK
MARGUERITE WAS THERE
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HIM NO BUT BRING THEM ALONG
I WENT UP TO THE MAN TO WHOM I WAS CAUSING SO MUCH ANXIETY
WE MEN ARE BUILT LIKE THAT AND IT IS VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE IMAGINATION LENDS SO MUCH POETRY TO THE SENSES AND THAT THE DESIRES OF THE BODY MAKE THUS SUCH CONCESSION TO THE DREAMS OF THE SOUL
MARGUERITE NO DOUBT REALIZED IT FOR SHE WENT ON
IT IS SICKENING NOT TO BE ABLE TO RETURN AT NIGHT WITHOUT YOUR MAKING YOUR APPEARANCE FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD
A WOMAN WHO IS NERVOUS ILL SAD OR GAY WITH A GAIETY SADDER THAN GRIEF A WOMAN WHO SPITS BLOOD AND SPENDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
IT HAS BEEN JUST THE SAME EVER SINCE I SAW YOU
BUT I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT ALL IS IN LITTLE
WE KNEW HIM VERY LITTLE
WHY BECAUSE IT HAS VERY DIFFERENT FLOWERS FROM THE OTHERS IS IT YOU WHO LOOK AFTER IT YES SIR
THEN SHE HELD IT OUT TOWARD PRUDENCE WITH A GESTURE WHICH SEEMED TO SAY WILL YOU HAVE SOME NO SIGNALLED PRUDENCE
SHE HAD SUFFERED
WELL MY DEAR FRIEND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR WOULD STILL BE TOO LITTLE AND FOR THIS REASON
AT ONE MOMENT I WOULD RECALL HOW MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO ME AND ASK MYSELF BY WHAT RIGHT I WROTE HER AN IMPERTINENT LETTER WHEN SHE COULD REPLY THAT IT WAS NOT M
MY DREAM VANISHED AT THE LAST WORDS OF PRUDENCE AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO REALITY SO BRUTALLY THAT I WAS STILL STUNNED WITH THE FALL
I GOT WEAKER EVERY DAY
WHEN WE REACHED THE GRAVE THE GARDENER HAD REMOVED ALL THE FLOWER-POTS THE IRON RAILING HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND TWO MEN WERE TURNING UP THE SOIL
I SMILED SADLY AND GAVE HIM MY HAND BURNING WITH FEVER
HE LOVED TO BIND UP THEIR WOUNDS AND TO FIND IN THOSE VERY WOUNDS THE BALM WHICH SHOULD HEAL THEM
AND YOU WHERE ARE YOU WHILE I WRITE THESE LINES
IS IT HONOURABLE FOR YOU TO LIVE LIKE HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH A WOMAN WHOM EVERYBODY HAS HAD WHAT DOES IT MATTER FATHER IF NO ONE WILL ANY MORE
MEANWHILE MARGUERITE CALLED ME UP TO HER BED ASKED ME TO OPEN A CUPBOARD AND POINTED OUT A CAP AND A LONG CHEMISE COVERED WITH LACE AND SAID IN A FEEBLE VOICE
DUVERNOY'S QUESTION ISN'T SHE COMING TO-DAY WHEN I HAD SAID THAT MARGUERITE WAS ILL
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND HOW WAS I TO RECONCILE THIS REPUTATION WITH HER CONSTANT REFUSAL OF THE YOUNG COUNT WHOM WE HAD FOUND AT HER HOUSE
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO OR SAY
NO DOUBT SHE HAD HEARD THAT I HAD GONE AWAY AND HAD THUS BEEN REASSURED AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR RUPTURE
SHE REPLIED THAT SHE WOULD SEND THE ANSWER LATER
AS I WAS AFRAID OF SOME NEW FIT OF OBSTINACY WHICH MY AMOUR PROPRE MIGHT HAVE SUSTAINED SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN MY PURSE I WROTE DOWN MY NAME HAD THE BOOK PUT ON ONE SIDE AND WENT OUT
CAME TO HER BOX FOR AN INSTANT
BUT IF SO WHY THOSE TEARS
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR
NO MADAME SAY THAT SHE IS TO BE ADMITTED AS SOON AS SHE COMES
HE HAS TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR
GAUTIER IF YOU SUCCEEDED IN HAVING HER SENT THERE
WHAT WILL BE THE END OF THIS MARVELLOUS CURE AND WHAT WILL YOU THINK OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO-DAY BY THE TIME YOU ARE FORTY
MARGUERITE SEATED AT THE PIANO LET HER FINGERS WANDER OVER THE NOTES BEGINNING SCRAPS OF MUSIC WITHOUT FINISHING THEM
HAVE MY THINGS TAKEN TO THE HOTEL DE PARIS HE SAID TO MY SERVANT
DECIDEDLY MARGUERITE WAS NOT LIKE OTHER WOMEN FOR THERE ARE FEW WHO WOULD HAVE RECEIVED SUCH A LETTER AS I HAD JUST WRITTEN WITHOUT ANSWERING IT AT ALL
LISTEN I SAID
GASTON R HIS NAME IS ISN'T IT YES SAID I NOT WITHOUT SMILING AS I THOUGHT OF WHAT GASTON HAD CONFIDED TO ME AND SAW THAT PRUDENCE SCARCELY EVEN KNEW HIS NAME
DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH A THING
IF I HAD SENT SOME ONE TO OFFER YOU THESE THREE HUNDRED LOUIS ON MY BEHALF ON THE CONDITIONS I ATTACH TO THEM YOU WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MUST HAVE SUFFERED MY FRIEND IF ALL THAT I READ IS TRUE MY FATHER CONFIRMED IT IN A LETTER WE TALKED FOR SOME TIME OVER THE SAD DESTINY WHICH HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND I WENT HOME TO REST A LITTLE
I CAN SPEAK BUT I AM STIFLED WHEN I SPEAK
I KNOW EVERY DETAIL OF IT AND YET WHENEVER I COME ACROSS THE VOLUME THE SAME SYMPATHY ALWAYS DRAWS ME TO IT
DID YOU KNOW HER SIR YES LIKE THE OTHER SAID THE GARDENER WITH A KNOWING SMILE
I MUST HAVE GIVEN CONSIDERABLE FOOD FOR REFLECTION TO THE WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE WHO WOULD NO DOUBT ASK THEMSELVES WHAT MY PURPOSE COULD HAVE BEEN IN PAYING A HUNDRED FRANCS FOR A BOOK WHICH I COULD HAVE HAD ANYWHERE FOR TEN OR AT THE OUTSIDE FIFTEEN
AS I SAW HIM A COLD SHIVER WENT THROUGH MY HEART
BUT MY GOOD MARGUERITE I REPLIED PRESSING HER HANDS LOVINGLY YOU KNEW THAT ONE DAY I SHOULD DISCOVER THE SACRIFICE YOU HAD MADE AND THAT THE MOMENT I DISCOVERED IT I SHOULD ALLOW IT NO LONGER BUT WHY BECAUSE MY DEAR CHILD I CAN NOT ALLOW YOUR AFFECTION FOR ME TO DEPRIVE YOU OF EVEN A TRINKET
I HAVE LONG WISHED FOR A YOUNG LOVER WHO SHOULD BE YOUNG AND NOT SELF-WILLED LOVING WITHOUT DISTRUST LOVED WITHOUT CLAIMING THE RIGHT TO IT
JUST BEFORE WE REACHED THE GRAVE ARMAND STOPPED TO WIPE HIS FACE WHICH WAS COVERED WITH GREAT DROPS OF SWEAT
THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM ASKING YOU ABOUT
SHE DID NOT DRIVE TO AND FRO LIKE THE OTHERS FROM THE ROND-POINT TO THE END OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
WE HID OURSELVES SO AS NOT TO BE SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN HE WANTS TO HAVE SUPPER WITH US AND DO YOU CONSENT WHAT DO YOU THINK I THINK THAT YOU ARE TWO CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T AN ATOM OF SENSE BETWEEN YOU
FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING
TO-DAY IS THE 15TH DECEMBER
YOU LOVE ARMAND
I HAD GAINED THREE HUNDRED LOUIS
NO IT IS ALL OVER REPLIED PRUDENCE
YOUR NERVES ARE A BIT UPSET TO-NIGHT THIS DRESS WORRIES ME CONTINUED MARGUERITE UNHOOKING HER BODICE
HE SAID INDEED BEFORE GOING THAT I COULD APPEAL WITHIN NINE DAYS BUT HE LEFT A MAN BEHIND TO KEEP WATCH
I PASSED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
NO ONE WAS THERE
THE CREDITORS DIVIDED AMONG THEM TWO THIRDS AND THE FAMILY A SISTER AND A GRAND-NEPHEW RECEIVED THE REMAINDER
ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS LEANING OVER HER SHOULDER AND WHISPERING IN HER EAR
ARE WE STILL SULKY SHE SAID TO ME
AND INDEED MY MEMORIES ONLY INCREASE MY FEVER BUT YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A LETTER WHICH DID ME GOOD MORE BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SAID THAN BY THE MATERIAL HELP WHICH IT CONTAINED
I OWE IT TO YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN HER LOVER AND ALSO DON'T I THAT I AM HER LOVER NO LONGER WELL I DID ALL I COULD TO GET HER AWAY FROM YOU AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL BE THANKFUL TO ME LATER ON I OWE YOU A DOUBLE GRATITUDE I ADDED RISING FOR I WAS DISGUSTED WITH THE WOMAN SEEING HER TAKE EVERY WORD I SAID TO HER AS IF IT WERE SERIOUS
SHE HAS NOTHING LEFT I WENT STRAIGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY LETTERS FROM MY FATHER
GIVE ME YOUR ARM AND LET US GO BACK TO THE DINING-ROOM
I SEALED THE LETTER AND WITHOUT TELLING HIM WHAT IT CONTAINED ASKED YOUR FATHER TO HAVE IT FORWARDED TO ITS ADDRESS ON REACHING PARIS
THE COUNT WILL BE COMING BACK AND THERE IS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY HIS FINDING YOU HERE BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM NO
SHE WAS IN NONE OF THEM
IT MUST BE SAID THAT MARGUERITE WAS JUST THEN VERY ILL
IF YOU SAW HER YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE WAY IN WHICH YOU ARE TREATING HER
ALL I REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN I RETURNED HOME I SPENT THREE HOURS OVER MY TOILET AND I LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND MY CLOCK A HUNDRED TIMES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY BOTH POINTED TO THE SAME HOUR
IF YOU REALLY WANT IT I WILL ASK HER FOR IT LET HER KEEP IT I STAMMERED FOR I FELT THE TEARS RISE FROM MY HEART TO MY EYES AT THE RECOLLECTION OF THE VILLAGE WHERE I HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AND AT THE THOUGHT THAT MARGUERITE CARED TO KEEP SOMETHING WHICH HAD BELONGED TO ME AND WOULD RECALL ME TO HER
SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND HER VELVET CLOAK AND THREW THEM ON THE BED THEN LET HERSELF DROP INTO A GREAT ARMCHAIR BESIDE THE FIRE WHICH SHE KEPT TILL THE VERY BEGINNING OF SUMMER AND SAID TO ME AS SHE FINGERED HER WATCH-CHAIN
IT WAS EMPTY
WE BEGAN TO LOOK OUT FOR FLATS
I AM EVEN GRATEFUL TO HER FOR I SEE NOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HAD LIVED WITH HER ALTOGETHER
IT IS NOTHING NOTHING
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS
AS THEY GET ACCUSTOMED TO HER THEY WANT TO RULE HER AND THE MORE ONE GIVES THEM THE MORE EXACTING THEY BECOME
WAS I THE CAUSE OF THIS COQUETRY
IT IS TRUE THAT IF WE HAD LIVED TOGETHER THIS YEAR I SHOULD NOT HAVE DIED SO SOON
HONEST CREATURES WHO HAD SPECULATED UPON THIS WOMAN'S PROSTITUTION WHO HAD GAINED THEIR HUNDRED PER CENT OUT OF HER WHO HAD PLAGUED WITH THEIR WRITS THE LAST MOMENTS OF HER LIFE AND WHO CAME NOW AFTER HER DEATH TO GATHER IN AT ONCE THE FRUITS OF THEIR DISHONOURABLE CALCULATIONS AND THE INTEREST ON THEIR SHAMEFUL CREDIT HOW WISE WERE THE ANCIENTS IN HAVING ONLY ONE GOD FOR TRADERS AND ROBBERS
I HEARD SHE WAS CONVALESCENT AND HAD GONE TO BAGNERES
THINK THEN WHAT YOU WOULD SUFFER IN THE PRESENCE OF A FATHER WHO SHOULD CALL ON YOU TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT FOR THE LIFE OF HIS SON
MY DOCTOR TELLS ME I MUST NOT WRITE EVERY DAY
WE ARE NO LONGER BEINGS BUT THINGS
SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM
FROM TIME TO TIME I FELT MY COMPANION'S ARM TREMBLE CONVULSIVELY AS IF HE SHIVERED FROM HEAD TO FEET
WE WILL HELP OURSELVES
SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME WE WENT INTO A CONFECTIONER'S IN THE PASSAGE DE L'OPERA
PRODUCED BY DIANNE BEAN CAMILLE LA DAME AUX CAMILIAS BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS FILS CHAPTER 1 IN MY OPINION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE CHARACTERS UNTIL ONE HAS SPENT A LONG TIME IN STUDYING MEN AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY ACQUIRED
OH I WOULD GIVE TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE TO WEEP AT HER FEET FOR AN HOUR IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO CONSOLE A SORROW THAT IS UNKNOWN TO ONE AND NEVERTHELESS I FELT SO LIVELY A SYMPATHY FOR THE YOUNG MAN HE MADE ME SO FRANKLY THE CONFIDANT OF HIS DISTRESS THAT I BELIEVED A WORD FROM ME WOULD NOT BE INDIFFERENT TO HIM AND I SAID
I CALLED HER AND AS SHE DID NOT ANSWER I CLOSED HER EYES AND KISSED HER ON THE FOREHEAD
I MADE HIM SMELL THE SALTS WHICH I HAD WITH ME AND WHEN WE REACHED HIS HOUSE ONLY THE SHIVERING REMAINED
SHE SEEMED VERY CHEERFUL
OF THOSE WHO WERE AT THE SUPPER I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED AT HER LEAVING THE TABLE
I EXPECT YOU
AT FIVE IN THE MORNING THE GUESTS DEPARTED
ONE DUTY REMAINED TO ARMAND--TO RETURN TO HIS FATHER
MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE
I WAS ALL THE MORE EAGER TO SEE THE ROOM
I HOPED THAT THE WALK WOULD DISTRACT HER AND THAT THE AIR WOULD DO HER GOOD
YOUR FATHER CAME OVER TO ME TOOK BOTH MY HANDS AND CONTINUED IN AN AFFECTIONATE VOICE
SHE HAS GONE AGAIN ASKED MARGUERITE
THEY COULD BUT HAVE BEEN THE PRESENTIMENT OF WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME AND DESPITE MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE I DID NOT FORESEE SUCH CONSEQUENCES
NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
MARGUERITE IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF A WOMAN FROM WHAT YOU THINK
I AM DISTURBING YOU I SAID TO PRUDENCE
SHE DID NOTHING BUT TALK OF YOU
AND ONE FINE DAY ONE DIES LIKE A DOG IN A DITCH AFTER HAVING RUINED OTHERS AND RUINED ONE'S SELF COME COME MADAME BE CALM SAID NANINE
ONLY A MAN WHO REALLY CARES NO MORE FOR HIS MISTRESS LEAVES HER WITHOUT WRITING TO HER
I CAN NOT REALIZE THAT THIS WOMAN SO YOUNG AND SO BEAUTIFUL WHEN I LEFT HER IS REALLY DEAD
PERMIT ME THEN SIMPLY TO WRITE TO YOU MADAME TO TELL YOU HOW PAINED I AM TO HEAR OF YOUR ILLNESS AND BELIEVE IN MY SINCERE WISHES FOR YOUR SPEEDY RECOVERY
SHE GAVE ME NO POSITIVE REASON BUT PUT ME OFF WITH THOSE EVASIONS WHICH A WOMAN RESORTS TO WHEN SHE WILL NOT TELL THE TRUTH
AS SHE PASSED ME SHE TURNED PALE AND A NERVOUS SMILE TIGHTENED ABOUT HER LIPS
I NEVER KNEW BEFORE THAT A RAY OF SUNSHINE COULD CONTAIN SO MUCH JOY SWEETNESS AND CONSOLATION
ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
DUVAL HAD SPOKEN TO ME
DO NOT THANK ME FOR IT
I AM SILLY ENOUGH TO LOVE YOU
I SPRANG AT THE CURTAIN CORD AND DREW IT VIOLENTLY
I SHALL LIKE WRITING IT OVER AGAIN SO AS TO GIVE MYSELF ANOTHER PROOF OF MY OWN JUSTIFICATION
I HEARD THE RUSTLE OF DRESSES THE SOUND OF VOICES ON THE STAIRCASE
I ACCEPT AND I SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL MY LIFE I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO QUESTION ARMAND ON THE SUBJECT OF MARGUERITE FOR THE INSCRIPTION IN THE BOOK THE YOUNG MAN'S HURRIED JOURNEY HIS DESIRE TO POSSESS THE VOLUME PIQUED MY CURIOSITY
I BEGAN TO FEAR LEST SOME ONE SHOULD ENTER
I TRIED TO THINK WHERE I HAD SEEN THE NAME AND REMEMBERED THE FIRST LEAF OF THE COPY OF MANON LESCAUT
FEBRUARY 4
WHO IS COMING NOW SHE SAID WITH AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT
TELL ME THAT YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE ME I SWEAR IT AT THESE WORDS SHE LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO READ IN MY EYES WHETHER MY OATH WAS SINCERE
THEN IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO ACCEPT ONE LIAISON BUT NOT TWO
THERE ARE NO SHOPS AND AT THAT HOUR IT IS QUITE DESERTED
SHE WOULD RATHER NOT SEE ME TILL THE WHOLE THING WAS DONE AND THAT WAS EVIDENTLY WHY PRUDENCE WAS EXPECTING HER WHEN SHE LET OUT THE SECRET
SHE WAS VEILED IT IS TRUE
AND THANKS TO A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE I ALONE CAN WRITE THESE THINGS FOR I ALONE AM ABLE TO GIVE THE FINAL DETAILS WITHOUT WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE STORY AT ONCE INTERESTING AND COMPLETE
SHE HAS CHANCED BY A MIRACLE ON AN OLD MAN WORTH TEN MILLIONS WHOSE WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE DEAD
AH ADDED PRUDENCE AS I WAS GOING THERE IS THE DUKE JUST COMING INTO MARGUERITE'S BOX I LOOKED AT HIM
EVERYBODY IS ABANDONING HER
A WEEK LATER AS WE WERE HAVING LUNCH NANINE CAME TO TELL US THAT MY SERVANT WAS ASKING FOR ME
DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I AM WRITING I HAD A HORROR OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE SUSPICION AND I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS WRITING
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT COLLECTION AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE THOUSAND LITTLE THINGS SO NECESSARY TO THE TOILET OF A WOMAN OF THE KIND WHICH WAS NOT IN GOLD OR SILVER
AND A MOMENT AFTER FOLDED THEM UP
ONLY IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT YOU WANTED TO COME TO THE VAUDEVILLE TO-NIGHT I COULD HAVE GOT THIS BOX FOR YOU AS WELL AS HE UNFORTUNATELY HE GOT IT FOR ME WITHOUT MY ASKING HIM AND HE ASKED ME TO GO WITH HIM
I WENT UP TO HER
I WENT UP TO HER
THE LAST TIME SHE HAD COME TO SEE ME SHE HAD SAT IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE SHE WAS NOW SITTING
A WOMAN WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A COMPANION THAN A SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR
I HOPE THEY WILL WAIT TILL THE END BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO SELL
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HER IT IS TRUE BUT THAT IS NOT A REASON FOR TORTURING A WOMAN WHO CAN NOT DEFEND HERSELF LET MLLE
I AM GOING INTO MY DRESSING-ROOM FOR A MOMENT SHE LIT THE CANDLES OF A CANDELABRA OPENED A DOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE BED AND DISAPPEARED
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
BESIDES THE PRESENCE OF MME
THEN YOU WILL HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST ME
FROM THAT DAY I INFLICTED ON MARGUERITE A CONTINUAL PERSECUTION
THE WINDOW OF HER DRESSING-ROOM LOOKS ON TO THE WINDOW OF MINE THEY SAY SHE IS A CHARMING GIRL DON'T YOU KNOW HER NO BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SHALL I ASK HER TO COME OVER TO OUR BOX NO I WOULD RATHER FOR YOU TO INTRODUCE ME TO HER AT HER OWN HOUSE YES
OH THAT GOOD TIME AT BOUGIVAL
WHO KNOWS IF I SHALL WRITE TO YOU TO-MORROW
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT
WOULD YOU LIKE FOR US TO GO ABROAD WHERE TO ITALY YOU ARE TIRED OF HERE I AM AFRAID OF THE WINTER
MARGUERITE WENT WITH US FOR A MOMENT
YESTERDAY WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY
BUT I FEARED IF I QUESTIONED MY VISITOR THAT I MIGHT SEEM TO HAVE REFUSED HIS MONEY ONLY IN ORDER TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRY INTO HIS AFFAIRS
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT RESPECT AND A SINCERE AFFECTION FOR MY FATHER
HE GOT UP SHOOTING PARTIES WITH FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO DIE WITHOUT CLEARING UP FOR YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT ME
SHE HAS MADE ME PROMISE TO WRITE TO YOU WHEN SHE CAN NO LONGER WRITE AND I WRITE BEFORE HER
I DID NOT KEEP IT
HE DOES NOT EXIST FOR HER AND PERHAPS IF HE SPOKE TO HER SHE WOULD ONLY LAUGH AT HIM AS MARGUERITE HAD LAUGHED AT ME
BUT SHE CAN'T STAND HIM
I NEVER SEE ANY ONE REMAIN AFTER I LEAVE
ALL IS OVER BETWEEN US
SHE CAN LIGHT YOU TO THE DOOR
THAT IS TO SAY IN NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER 1842
BUT DELIRIOUS OR LUCID IT IS ALWAYS YOUR NAME THAT SHE PRONOUNCES WHEN SHE CAN SPEAK A WORD
THE SWEAT BROKE OUT ON MY FOREHEAD
SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU FOR THOSE THAT COME TO SEE THE POOR GIRL DON'T EXACTLY CUMBER THE CEMETERY DOESN'T ANYBODY COME NOBODY EXCEPT THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CAME ONCE ONLY ONCE YES SIR HE NEVER CAME BACK AGAIN NO BUT HE WILL WHEN HE GETS HOME HE IS AWAY SOMEWHERE YES DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS I BELIEVE HE HAS GONE TO SEE MLLE
WHEN DID YOU COME FATHER LAST NIGHT DID YOU COME STRAIGHT HERE AS USUAL YES I AM VERY SORRY NOT TO HAVE BEEN HERE TO RECEIVE YOU I EXPECTED THAT THE SERMON WHICH MY FATHER'S COLD FACE THREATENED WOULD BEGIN AT ONCE
I WILL SEE YOU TO-MORROW THE GOOD GIRL WENT AND GOT ME A CLOAK PUT IT OVER MY SHOULDERS AND OFFERED TO WAKE UP MME
WHEN IT STRUCK HALF PAST TEN I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO
I AM HUNGRY NEED I TELL YOU THE IMPRESSION WHICH THIS SCENE MADE UPON ME OR CAN YOU NOT IMAGINE IT
NOW YOU HAVE ONLY TO READ A FEW SHEETS WHICH JULIE DUPRAT GAVE ME
AT LAST I LEFT THE ROOM WHERE EVERY OBJECT HAD ASSUMED THAT MELANCHOLY ASPECT WHICH THE RESTLESS SOLITUDE OF THE HEART GIVES TO ALL ITS SURROUNDINGS
TISN'T A MERRY TRADE OURS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A LITTLE HEART LEFT
THAT IS NOT THE WAY I SAID
AS FOR ME I LOOKED AT HER WITH A MINGLING OF LOVE AND TERROR AS I THOUGHT OF ALL THAT I WAS READY TO SUFFER FOR HER SAKE
THEN AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
BUT HOW WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
I RANG AT THE NEXT DOOR
NO ONE WOULD CONSIDER WHETHER ARMAND LOVES YOU WHETHER YOU LOVE HIM WHETHER THIS MUTUAL LOVE MEANS HAPPINESS TO HIM AND REDEMPTION TO YOU
SHE IS YOUNG PRETTY YOU LOVE HER THEY SAY
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD I OFTEN MET MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE OR IN THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
THE WEATHER WAS FINE
DO NOT GO AGAINST HIS PRINCIPLES PRETEND TO MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS TO WHAT HE WANTS
AS FOR ME THE PERFORMANCE INTERESTED ME EQUALLY LITTLE AND I PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYTHING BUT HER THOUGH DOING MY UTMOST TO KEEP HER FROM NOTICING IT
I MUST SEEM TO YOU VERY ABSURD HE ADDED BUT PARDON ME AND BELIEVE THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME SIR I ANSWERED IF THE SERVICE WHICH I CAN RENDER YOU IS ABLE TO LESSEN YOUR TROUBLE A LITTLE TELL ME AT ONCE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU AND YOU WILL FIND ME ONLY TOO HAPPY TO OBLIGE YOU M
AT LAST THE SUPPER WAS OVER AND I WAS ALONE WITH MARGUERITE
DE B
I MUST SEE HER
H WILL CALL ON YOU
YOU WOULD COME AND SEE ME AND YOUR VISITS WOULD DO ME GOOD
GOOD-EVENING I REPLIED TO BOTH MARGUERITE AND PRUDENCE
ALL THE TIME I HAD MY EYES FIXED ON THE STALL WHERE YOU SAT THAT DAY THOUGH A SORT OF COUNTRY FELLOW SAT THERE LAUGHING LOUDLY AT ALL THE FOOLISH THINGS THAT THE ACTORS SAID
I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS CONCERNED
BUT AFTER ALL LIKE THE OTHERS AND I OUGHT TO HAVE EXPECTED WHAT HAPPENED
WHILE MARGUERITE A SINNER LIKE MANON AND PERHAPS CONVERTED LIKE HER HAD DIED IN A SUMPTUOUS BED IT SEEMED AFTER WHAT I HAD SEEN THE BED OF HER PAST BUT IN THAT DESERT OF THE HEART A MORE BARREN A VASTER A MORE PITILESS DESERT THAN THAT IN WHICH MANON HAD FOUND HER LAST RESTING-PLACE
PROVE IT TO HIM BY THE SOLE MEANS WHICH REMAINS TO YOU OF YET PROVING IT TO HIM BY SACRIFICING YOUR LOVE TO HIS FUTURE
WHEN I THINK THAT SHE IS DEAD NOW I ASK MYSELF IF GOD WILL EVER FORGIVE ME FOR THE WRONG I DID HER
I SHOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU SOMETHING WHICH WOULD ALWAYS REMIND YOU OF ME BUT EVERYTHING HERE HAS BEEN SEIZED AND I HAVE NOTHING OF MY OWN
I REALIZED THIS FACT STILL MORE CLEARLY FROM CERTAIN GLANCES WHICH MARGUERITE BESTOWED UPON HER WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH HER
WHY IS IT YOU ARE THE FIRST WHOM I HAVE EVER ASKED TO SHARE THE JOY OF THIS DESIRE OF MINE
I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT RELIGION BUT I THINK THAT GOD WILL KNOW THAT MY TEARS WERE GENUINE MY PRAYERS FERVENT MY ALMS-GIVING SINCERE AND THAT HE WILL HAVE PITY ON HER WHO DYING YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL HAS ONLY HAD ME TO CLOSE HER EYES AND PUT HER IN HER SHROUD
I WAS HALF DEMENTED
YOU PUT AN END TO YOUR WHOLE CAREER
BUT THOSE WHO HAD LOVED MARGUERITE WERE NOT TO BE COUNTED NOR THOSE WHOM SHE HAD LOVED
I ROSE FROM MY SEAT
WAS MORE FORTUNATE FOR HE PRESENTED HIMSELF SHORTLY AFTERWARD AND AT FOUR IN THE MORNING HE HAD NOT LEFT
EVERY BEING WHO IS NOT THE BELOVED ONE SEEMS A USELESS BEING IN CREATION
SINCE THERE IS MORE JOY IN HEAVEN OVER ONE SINNER THAT REPENTETH THAN OVER NINETY AND NINE JUST PERSONS THAT NEED NO REPENTANCE LET US GIVE JOY TO HEAVEN
AT THE SIGHT OF THE LETTER AND ON HEARING MY COMMENT HER TEARS BEGAN TO FLOW SO COPIOUSLY THAT I FEARED AN ATTACK OF NERVES AND CALLING NANINE I PUT HER TO BED WHERE SHE WEPT WITHOUT A WORD BUT HELD MY HANDS AND KISSED THEM EVERY MOMENT
BE HER LOVER FOR A MONTH TWO MONTHS
SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT AND I SAT DOWN AND TOOK THE HAND WHICH WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
GAUTIER I SAID TO PRUDENCE SHOULD TURN ME OUT OF HER OWN HOUSE IS QUITE REASONABLE BUT THAT SHE SHOULD INSULT THE WOMAN WHOM I LOVE UNDER THE PRETENCE THAT THIS WOMAN IS MY MISTRESS IS A THING I WILL NEVER PERMIT MY FRIEND SAID PRUDENCE YOU ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A WOMAN WHO HAS NEITHER HEART NOR SENSE
I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH THAT I COULDN'T REFUSE
THE NOT DISDAINFUL CALM THE NOT CONTEMPTUOUS DIGNITY WITH WHICH MARGUERITE RESPONDED TO ALL MY ATTACKS AND WHICH RAISED HER ABOVE ME IN MY OWN EYES ENRAGED ME STILL MORE AGAINST HER
WE WILL TAKE A NICE LITTLE FLAT IN WHICH WE CAN BOTH LIVE
HAVE YOU THE RIGHT HAVE YOU THE STRENGTH TO SHATTER IT
I WANT YOU TO STAY THE COUNT TOOK A VERY ELEGANT WATCH OUT OF HIS POCKET AND LOOKED AT THE TIME
AND I WISH ALL RELATIONS TOOK AS MUCH TROUBLE ABOUT THE DEAD AS THE YOUNG MAN WHO GAVE ME MY ORDERS AFTER SEVERAL TURNINGS THE GARDENER STOPPED AND SAID TO ME
IF HE ACCEPTED FROM YOU THE SACRIFICE WHICH YOU ARE ON THE POINT OF MAKING HIS HONOUR AND DIGNITY WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO GIVE YOU IN EXCHANGE FOR IT THIS INCOME WHICH WOULD ALWAYS PUT YOU OUT OF DANGER OF ADVERSITY
THEY EITHER KILL OUTRIGHT OR ARE VERY SOON OVERCOME
OH NO
DUVERNOY SHE LEFT NO WORD FOR ME NO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID AFTERWARD THEY WENT AWAY IN A CARRIAGE WHAT SORT OF A CARRIAGE A PRIVATE CARRIAGE WHAT COULD IT ALL MEAN
I SHALL NOT SEE YOU FOR I AM QUITE NEAR DEATH AND YOU ARE HUNDREDS OF LEAGUES AWAY
HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM
DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU
HENCE THOSE GREAT DEVOTIONS THOSE AUSTERE RETREATS FROM THE WORLD OF WHICH SOME OF THEM HAVE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE
AND THOUGH SHE OFTEN PASSED PEOPLE WHOM SHE KNEW HER SMILE WHEN SHE CHOSE TO SMILE WAS SEEN ONLY BY THEM AND A DUCHESS MIGHT HAVE SMILED IN JUST SUCH A MANNER
MY FATHER AND SISTER MUST HAVE WRITTEN TO ME AT PARIS AND I WENT AWAY IN SUCH HASTE THAT I DID NOT GO AND SEE BEFORE LEAVING
HERE'S NANINE COMING IN
I REMEMBERED HAVING OFTEN MET MARGUERITE IN THE BOIS WHERE SHE WENT REGULARLY EVERY DAY IN A LITTLE BLUE COUPE DRAWN BY TWO MAGNIFICENT BAYS AND I HAD NOTICED IN HER A DISTINCTION QUITE APART FROM OTHER WOMEN OF HER KIND A DISTINCTION WHICH WAS ENHANCED BY A REALLY EXCEPTIONAL BEAUTY
YOU HAD ONLY BEEN GONE AN HOUR WHEN YOUR FATHER PRESENTED HIMSELF
I GOT UP AND WENT INTO MY ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK WHICH I HANDED TO HIM
FOR THE REST THERE WERE PLENTY OF THINGS WORTH BUYING
BUT THE LAST SHOCK HAD BEEN TOO VIOLENT AND LOUISE DIED OF IT
ALL THOSE THAT WE SAW SEEMED TO MARGUERITE TOO DEAR AND TO ME TOO SIMPLE
THE MEMORIES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE CAME TO ME WITHOUT SHADOW OR HINDRANCE ESCORTED GAILY BY THE HOPES OF THE NIGHT TO COME
I ROSE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND GOODBYE SAID I
THE GARDENER INTERRUPTED HIM SAYING
I WAS VERY YOUNG THEN AND READY TO ACCEPT FOR MYSELF THE EASY MORALITY OF THE AGE
SERVE THE DINNER TWO DAYS AFTERWARD THERE CAME A LETTER FROM PRUDENCE AND FOR A FORTNIGHT MARGUERITE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT RID OF HER MYSTERIOUS GLOOM FOR WHICH SHE CONSTANTLY ASKED MY FORGIVENESS NOW THAT IT NO LONGER EXISTED
I DID NOT ANSWER
I WENT TO SEE OLYMPE WHOM I FOUND TRYING ON DRESSES AND WHEN WE WERE ALONE SHE SANG OBSCENE SONGS TO AMUSE ME
MY CREDITORS HAVE PUT HIM THERE TO SEE THAT NOTHING IS TAKEN AWAY AND THAT NOTHING REMAINS TO ME IN CASE I DO NOT DIE
WE WERE BEATING ABOUT FOR GAME AND I WAS GIVEN MY POST
IT IS TRUE THAT FOR TWELVE YEARS OF HER LIFE SHE USED TO BEAT ME
THE BLACK HAIR LONG AND DRY WAS PRESSED TIGHTLY ABOUT THE FOREHEAD AND HALF VEILED THE GREEN HOLLOWS OF THE CHEEKS
I DID NOT CLOSE MY EYES ALL NIGHT
WILL THE DUKE ANSWER
IT SEEMED AS IF HER CHEST WERE BEING TORN IN TWO
LET US BE FRIENDS GOOD FRIENDS BUT NO MORE
THE MAN WHO WAS THE LOVER OF SUCH A WOMAN MIGHT WELL BE AS PROUD AS M
I GAZED AT HER SO FIXEDLY THAT MY EYES ATTRACTED HERS
YOURS WHICH I WAS SURE OF GAINING LATER ON
DO YOU WANT TO SEE M
MORE INTELLIGENCE AND PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE HEART THAN MOST DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING PARTICULAR ABOUT HER SHE RUINED BARON DE G NO MORE THAN THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS OF THE OLD DUKE OF WAS SHE REALLY HIS MISTRESS SO THEY SAY
I AM QUITE WELL
THERE ARE TWO REASONS WHY HE IS LIKELY TO LEAVE HER NOTHING
DUVERNOY IS NOT BEHAVING WELL
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MARGUERITE ASKED GASTON
BUT I WANTED TO LET YOU SLEEP ON
SHE WATCHED THE FEW PASSERS I REFLECTED
AS FOR ME I WAS RIVETTED TO THE SPOT FROM THE MOMENT SHE WENT IN TILL THE MOMENT WHEN SHE CAME OUT AGAIN
THE DOCTOR HAS FORBIDDEN ME TO TOUCH A PEN
WHY SHOULD WE SPEND MONEY ABROAD
WE FORESAW TROUBLE
AS FOR MARGUERITE SHE WAS ALREADY IN HER WHITE DRESSING-GOWN
HE DID NOT PRESENT HIMSELF QUITE AS HE HAD WRITTEN
DUVAL SIR SAID THE GARDENER WHO WAS WALKING BESIDE ME
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE TO HAVE BEEN IN THE OLD MAN'S PLACE
DO NOT WONDER AT MY JOY IN MARTYRDOM ARMAND
I WAS TOO THANKFUL THAT MY FATHER WAS WILLING TO CONSOLE ME UNDER SUCH A CALAMITY
MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY WITHOUT DARKENING WITH ITS SHADOW THE RADIANT PICTURE OF OUR YOUTH AND LOVE
SCARCELY HAD HE SEATED HIMSELF WHEN THE SHIVERING BECAME MORE VIOLENT AND HE HAD AN ACTUAL ATTACK OF NERVES IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HIS FEAR OF FRIGHTENING ME MADE HIM PRESS MY HAND AND WHISPER
JANUARY 25
EVERY DAY I WENT TO ASK AFTER HER WITHOUT LEAVING MY NAME OR MY CARD
HER LOOSENED HAIR STREAMED ABOUT HER
DO NOT MOCK MY SORROW YOU WHO KNOW BETTER THAN ANY ONE WHAT ITS CAUSE AND ITS DEPTH ARE IT ONLY DEPENDED ON YOU NOT TO HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY AT ALL IF YOU ARE AS YOU SAY NO MY FRIEND
OFTEN A WOMAN TAKES A LOVER IN OBEDIENCE TO THE MERE WILL OF THE SENSES AND LEARNS WITHOUT EXPECTING IT THE MYSTERY OF IMMATERIAL LOVE AND LIVES HENCEFORTH ONLY THROUGH HER HEART
THE FURNITURE WAS SUPERB
AM I DISTURBING YOU PERHAPS
BUT TO-DAY I HAVE TOO MUCH NEED OF TEARS
IT IS ALL OVER I ADDED
SHALL I GO TO THE DOOR SAID JOSEPH
RECOGNISE THAT IT IS YOUR FATHER WHO SPEAKS TO YOU YOUR FATHER WHO HAS ALWAYS LOVED YOU AND WHO ONLY DESIRES YOUR HAPPINESS
SHE WENT INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM AND RAISED HER VEIL
BUT SHE ALWAYS REFUSED ASSURING ME THAT SHE COULD NOT BE SO HAPPY ANYWHERE AS IN THE COUNTRY
AM I SURE OF COMING HERE AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD
INTENTIONALLY OR NOT SINCE YOUR RETURN YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SO MUCH PAIN THAT I SHOULD BE INCAPABLE NOW OF ENDURING A FOURTH PART OF WHAT I HAVE ENDURED TILL NOW
BUT SINCE THIS IS THE WAY YOU THANK ME I SHALL PROFIT BY THE LESSON I WAS WRONG
ASK YOUR FRIEND GASTON
PERHAPS MARGUERITE'S PORTER WOULD KNOW WHERE ARMAND LIVED
COME IN BOLDLY FATHER I SAID TO HIM
THEY TOOK FRIGHT AND IN TWO DAYS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD UP AND NOW IT IS ALL PAID MORE OR LESS AND WHO HAS SUPPLIED THE MONEY THE COMTE DE N
ABOUT TWO THERE WAS A RING AND PRUDENCE ENTERED
THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE
I MAY DIE OF THIS ILLNESS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE PRESENTIMENT THAT I SHALL DIE YOUNG
I HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR ELEVEN NIGHTS
CHARM SWEETNESS SPONTANEITY MARGUERITE HAD THEM ALL AND I WAS FORCED FROM TIME TO TIME TO ADMIT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO ASK OF HER ANYTHING ELSE
A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION GREETED HER AS SHE ENTERED THE SHOP
YOU BOUGHT SOMETHING AT MARGUERITE'S SALE YES A BOOK MANON LESCAUT PRECISELY HAVE YOU THE BOOK STILL IT IS IN MY BEDROOM ON HEARING THIS ARMAND DUVAL SEEMED TO BE RELIEVED OF A GREAT WEIGHT AND THANKED ME AS IF I HAD ALREADY RENDERED HIM A SERVICE MERELY BY KEEPING THE BOOK
MY DEAR MARGUERITE
GASTON R AH YES I KNOW HIM
IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I SHOULD GET WELL IF YOU CAME
I DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS AND I WAS AFRAID LEST SHE SHOULD GUESS WHY I HAD COME IN AND BE OFFENDED
NATURALLY OH YES YOU WILL COME BACK TO-NIGHT
CHILD THRICE CHILD ONLY REMEMBER THAT I LOVE YOU AND DON'T LET ANYTHING DISTURB YOU
ASK PRUDENCE AH SAID SHE IT IS AMAZING NOW YOU MUST GO BACK TO YOUR SEAT
WHEN SHE GOT HERE SHE WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE
THE COUNT LEFT THE BOX AND MARGUERITE BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER
WILL YOU BY ALL MEANS IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LET US TRAVEL I SAID
ARNOULD ASKED US IF WE WOULD TAKE A BOAT AND MARGUERITE AND PRUDENCE ACCEPTED JOYOUSLY
SO MADAME IT IS NOT BY REMONSTRANCES OR BY THREATS BUT BY ENTREATIES THAT I MUST ENDEAVOUR TO OBTAIN FROM YOU A GREATER SACRIFICE THAN YOU HAVE YET MADE FOR MY SON I TREMBLED AT THIS BEGINNING
MY DEAR PRUDENCE ARE YOU IN WANT OF ANY MONEY YOU KNOW MY CHILD IT IS THE 15TH IN A COUPLE OF DAYS SO IF YOU COULD LEND ME THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED FRANCS YOU WOULD DO ME A REAL SERVICE SEND OVER TO-MORROW
THE POOR FELLOW IS IN RATHER A BAD WAY AS TO MONEY
FORGET THE REST AND REMEMBER ONLY ONE THING
D THE MOST ELEGANT AND FAMOUS ADULTERESS OF OUR TIME
MARGUERITE IS VERY FOND OF YOU MY DEAR FELLOW BUT YOUR LIAISON WITH HER IN HER INTERESTS AND IN YOURS OUGHT NOT TO BE SERIOUS
THE POOR GIRL LEFT ME FOR HER CARRIAGE HER FURNITURE AND HER DIAMONDS
YOU SHALL NOT GO I SAID PUTTING MYSELF IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
YOU DO NO MORE FOR LOVE THAN YOU HAVE DONE FOR MONEY
AND THE SIDES WILL BE EQUAL YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT SHE WILL NOT DO THAT
THE DUKE CAME IN THE MORNING
AT NIGHT I WENT INTO ALL THE THEATRES WHERE SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO GO
BELIEVE ME I CONTINUED SEEING HIM MAKE AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT YOU EXAGGERATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS LIAISON
SUPPOSING HERSELF MISTAKEN SHE LOOKED AWAY
IS NEVER THERE
THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE
IS SHE ALONE I ASKED
THEN SOME KIND SOULS WARNED HIM THAT HIS DEBTOR HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY THE DUKE AND WAS LIVING WITH A PENNILESS YOUNG MAN
JUDGE ME AND PARDON ME AS I HAVE PARDONED YOU FOR ALL THE WRONG THAT YOU HAVE DONE ME SINCE THAT DAY
MY SERVANT OR RATHER MY PORTER WHO ACTED AS MY SERVANT WENT TO THE DOOR AND BROUGHT ME A CARD SAYING THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM WISHED TO SEE ME
THEY TALKED FOR A FEW MOMENTS
I RESOLVED THAT SHE SHOULD PAY FOR WHAT I HAD SUFFERED
YES WELL I AM PRETTY SURE HE IS NOT BACK YET OR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE ALREADY YOU DON'T THINK HE HAS FORGOTTEN MARGUERITE I AM NOT ONLY SURE HE HASN'T BUT I WOULD WAGER THAT HE WANTS TO CHANGE HER GRAVE SIMPLY IN ORDER TO HAVE ONE MORE LOOK AT HER WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE FIRST WORD HE SAID TO ME WHEN HE CAME TO THE CEMETERY WAS
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN THERE ARE NO MEN NO COME THEN MY FRIEND WENT TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE THEATRE
I WAS ALONE UNABLE TO SLEEP DEVOURED BY RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WHEN BY SIMPLY LETTING THINGS TAKE THEIR NATURAL COURSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITH MARGUERITE HEARING THE DELICIOUS WORDS WHICH I HAD HEARD ONLY TWICE AND WHICH MADE MY EARS BURN IN MY SOLITUDE
FINALLY WHETHER IT WAS SIMPLE NATURE OR A BREATH OF FEVER THERE PASSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE EYES OF THIS WOMAN A GLIMMER OF DESIRE GIVING PROMISE OF A VERY HEAVEN FOR ONE WHOM SHE SHOULD LOVE
YOU WILL GO BACK WITH PRUDENCE AFTER THE THEATRE AND YOU WILL STAY THERE TILL I CALL
THE PERSON WHOM SHE HAD ADMITTED DID NOT COME FARTHER THAN THE DINING-ROOM
REALLY TRUE I SWEAR IT WELL IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO EVERYTHING I TELL YOU WITHOUT A WORD WITHOUT AN OPINION WITHOUT A QUESTION PERHAPS I WILL SAY YES I WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU WISH BUT I FOREWARN YOU I MUST BE FREE TO DO AS I PLEASE WITHOUT GIVING YOU THE SLIGHTEST DETAILS WHAT I DO
THAT NIGHT I FOUND HER FEVERISH AND AGITATED
WHERE IS MARGUERITE AT HOME ALONE WITH M
I SAID TO MYSELF WHEN I WAS ALONE
MY FATHER HAD GONE OUT
A MAN OF ABOUT SEVENTY HAD SAT DOWN BEHIND HER AND WAS GIVING HER A BAG OF SWEETS INTO WHICH SHE DIPPED AT ONCE SMILING
THE SOUL IS BUT THE VESTAL CHARGED TO FEED THE SACRED FIRE OF LOVE
I WAITED THERE FOUR HOURS
AND THEN PEOPLE ARE SO QUEER WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CARRY THEIR PRIDE EVEN HERE
I HAD BEEN POETIZING TOO MUCH
WELL I SAID TO HIM
YOUR LOVE FOR ME HAD OPENED MY HEART TO NOBLE ENTHUSIASM
IT WAS SHE WHO HAS JUST GONE OUT IS SHE AFRAID OF ME NOW NO BUT SHE IS AFRAID THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE HER BUT WHY I SAID DRAWING MY BREATH WITH DIFFICULTY FOR I WAS CHOKED WITH EMOTION
THEN FROM MANON AND MARGUERITE MY MIND WANDERED TO THOSE WHOM I KNEW AND WHOM I SAW SINGING ALONG THE WAY WHICH LED TO JUST SUCH ANOTHER DEATH
SHE CONSOLED HERSELF I BELIEVE WITH AN ACTOR FROM SOME THEATRE OR OTHER
IT IS THE MOST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IF THE PARENTS WHO PAY FOR BEING WEPT OVER ARE WEPT OVER IN RETURN FOR THE PRICE THEY PAY
I REPLIED THAT I HAD GONE OUT EARLY IN ORDER TO RESERVE A PLACE IN THE DILIGENCE FOR C WHERE MY FATHER LIVED
SHE WAS DRESSED IN BLACK AND VEILED
YES ANSWERED THE MAN
I OVERTOOK ONE OR TWO WAGONS WHICH I SOON LEFT BEHIND
NEVER HAD I BEEN SO HAPPY
ONE FEELS BETTER WHILE TELLING WHAT ONE SUFFERS YOU ARE RIGHT
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME
AS FOR ME I CAN ONLY PITY YOU IT IS TRUE HE SAID RISING AND WALKING TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM I AM WEARYING YOU
AND I WAS REALLY CARRIED AWAY
I RANG
IT WAS AT THE OPERA COMIQUE TWO YEARS AGO
YOUR TWO VISITS HAVE GIVEN ME PLEASURE ARMAND HE SAID
I THOUGHT OF MANON LESCAUT SQUANDERING WITH DESGRIEUX THE MONEY OF M
BETTER COME AND HAVE SUPPER
MY HEALTH NATURALLY GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND WHEN I SENT MME
I PRETENDED NOT TO SEE THEM AND TRIED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION
SHE HAD MADE THE FORTUNE AT A SINGLE STROKE WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING THE SOURCE OF THAT FORTUNE
IF THE INTEREST YOU TAKE IN ME IS REAL ARMAND WHEN YOU COME BACK GO AND SEE JULIE DUPRAT
BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THEM EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS LOVE IN THE COURSE OF HER LIFE THAT SHE SUFFERED FOR IT AND THAT SHE DIED OF IT
TELL ME SIR I SAID TO YOUR FATHER WIPING AWAY MY TEARS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I LOVE YOUR SON YES SAID M
THERE SHE LEFT HER CARRIAGE WALKED FOR AN HOUR RETURNED TO HER CARRIAGE AND DROVE RAPIDLY HOME
PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT CHILDISH ENOUGH IF THEY SAW ME LAMENT LIKE THIS OVER A DEAD WOMAN SUCH AS SHE
AT PARIS THERE WERE WOMEN IN BETTER HEALTH AND NOT SO THIN AS I WAS
STICK TO HER
IF THEY HAVE THE VANITY TO WISH TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING THEY GET RUINED LIKE THE FOOLS THEY ARE AND GO AND GET KILLED IN AFRICA AFTER LEAVING A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OF DEBT IN PARIS
I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS
THERE WE LISTENED TO THE CHEERFUL HARMONIES OF EVENING BOTH OF US THINKING OF THE COMING HOURS WHICH SHOULD LEAVE US TO ONE ANOTHER TILL THE DAWN OF DAY
HAVING COME RATHER TO EXAMINE THAN TO BUY I WATCHED THE FACES OF THE AUCTIONEERS NOTICING HOW THEY BEAMED WITH DELIGHT WHENEVER ANYTHING REACHED A PRICE BEYOND THEIR EXPECTATIONS
HE SHOWED SO LITTLE ASTONISHMENT AT SEEING ME THAT IT WAS AS IF HE WAS EXPECTING ME
IN EMPLOYING THEM I WAS MAKING A GREATER SACRIFICE FOR YOU THAN YOU IMAGINE
HE LOOKS ILL COME I SAID TO ARMAND TAKING HIM BY THE ARM
I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
TILL TO-NIGHT SHE KISSED ME MORE WARMLY THAN EVER BUT SAID NOTHING
THEIR TWO EXISTENCES ARE HENCEFORTH ONE
THEN FASTEN IT UP AND TAKE IT AWAY SAID THE INSPECTOR
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY YOU WENT TO SEE PRUDENCE TO SEE HER THAT'S A LIE MY FRIEND WELL I WENT TO ASK HER IF THE HORSE WAS ANY BETTER AND IF SHE WANTED YOUR SHAWL AND YOUR JEWELS ANY LONGER MARGUERITE BLUSHED BUT DID NOT ANSWER
M ONE OF OUR WITTIEST STORY-TELLERS WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WRITES WHAT SHE SAYS AND SIGNS WHAT SHE WRITES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE EXCHANGED CONFIDENTIAL GLANCES WITH MME
NEXT DAY I LEFT AT TEN O'CLOCK AND REACHED THE HOTEL ABOUT TWELVE
I WROTE TO HIM FOUR TIMES AND HE HAS NEVER ONCE REPLIED
ALL THE PLAYERS WERE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY DOWNSTAIRS
YET ALL THE SAME IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THEY COULD NOT HELP LOOKING ABOUT FOR SOME TRACES OF THIS COURTESAN'S LIFE OF WHICH THEY HAD HEARD NO DOUBT STRANGE ENOUGH STORIES
SHE RECEIVES YOU IN THE GREATEST STYLE SHE IS COVERED WITH DIAMONDS SHE NEEDN'T COST YOU A PENNY UNLESS YOU LIKE AND YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED
HOW COULD YOU HAVE DECEIVED ME MARGUERITE WHEN I LOVED YOU SO MUCH
YOU YOURSELF SAW WHEN PRUDENCE BROUGHT ME THE SIX THOUSAND FRANCS THAT I HAD ASKED HER TO GET FROM THE DUKE HOW SHE BORROWED FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS WHICH SHE WILL NEVER PAY ME BACK OR WHICH SHE WILL PAY ME IN HATS WHICH WILL NEVER BE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR BOXES
WITHOUT A WORD TO ME HE HAD HAD MY LUGGAGE PACKED AND PUT UP BEHIND THE CHAISE WITH HIS OWN AND SO HE CARRIED ME OFF
I GIVE HER GOOD ADVICE AND SHE ONLY SAYS IT WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO TAKE ON THE COUNT WHEN THE DUKE IS DEAD
I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO LOVE YOU AS I WOULD NOR POOR ENOUGH TO LOVE YOU AS YOU WOULD
SHE ROSE AND RAN INTO HER DRESSING-ROOM
I WAS FAR FROM HAVING GIVEN UP THINKING ABOUT MARGUERITE
IT DID YOU MORE HARM WITH ME THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DONE
EXISTENCE ITSELF IS BUT THE UNCEASING ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AN UNCHANGING DESIRE
I SAW IN HER A MEANS OF MEETING WITH MARGUERITE AND PROFITED BY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE LOOKED MY WAY TO WAVE MY HAND TO HER
IT WAS MADE UP OF A SERIES OF LITTLE CHILDISH EVENTS CHARMING FOR US BUT INSIGNIFICANT TO ANY ONE ELSE
BUT TO BE REALLY LOVED BY A COURTESAN
HE AGREED AND WE LEFT OUR STALLS TO GO ROUND TO MME
HOWEVER A FEW YOUNG MEN HAVE COME TO INQUIRE FOR ME
PRUDENCE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME
MY FRIEND INTRODUCED ME
HIS LETTER WHICH I INCLOSE WITH THIS BEGGED ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS TERMS TO KEEP YOU AWAY ON THE FOLLOWING DAY ON SOME EXCUSE OR OTHER AND TO SEE YOUR FATHER WHO WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME AND ASKED ME PARTICULARLY NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT
SOME ONE WHO REPENTS OF A LETTER THAT HE WROTE YESTERDAY AND WHO WILL LEAVE PARIS TO-MORROW IF YOU DO NOT FORGIVE HIM WISHES TO KNOW AT WHAT HOUR HE MIGHT LAY HIS REPENTANCE AT YOUR FEET
I LEFT WORD FOR HIM BEGGING HIM TO COME AND SEE ME AS SOON AS HE ARRIVED OR TO SEND ME WORD WHERE I COULD FIND HIM
I TRIED TO GET RID OF MY FIRST SUPPOSITION
I RUSHED TO THE BED
YOU ARE CRYING
I WENT TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
SHE HAD PRETENDED TO BE CALMER WHEN I HAD PROPOSED STAYING WITH HER
AND WHEN MY SERVANT CAME TO MY ROOM AT EIGHT O'CLOCK I GAVE IT TO HIM AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE IT AT ONCE
NOW LET ME TRY SHE TOOK HER PLACE AND BEGAN TO PLAY
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO OBTAIN US FOR A BOUQUET OF FLOWERS
WE MUST TALK OVER IT
SHE CAST DOWN HER EYES AND I READ IN HER FACE THE FEAR OF SEEING MY VISIT PROLONGED
DUVAL HE REPLIED
YOU SEE I SPEAK TO YOU FRANKLY LIKE A FRIEND BUT WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU DOING THERE CRIED PRUDENCE WHO HAD COME IN WITHOUT OUR BEARING HER AND WHO NOW STOOD JUST INSIDE THE DOOR WITH HER HAIR HALF COMING DOWN AND HER DRESS UNDONE
SHE SAID YES AND HE WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH AN ABBE FROM SAINT ROCH
I WAS SORRY FOR HIM FOR HE SEEMED LIKE MYSELF TO BE IN LOVE AND THE BITTER FRANKNESS OF MARGUERITE MUST HAVE MADE HIM VERY UNHAPPY ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF TWO STRANGERS
THE OTHER CREDITORS WERE TOLD THE SAME
SHE SAID IT WAS ARRANGED QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGUERITE SHARPLY
DO LIKE THE OTHERS
THERE IS NO MAN TO WHOM A WOMAN HAS NOT BEEN UNFAITHFUL ONCE AT LEAST AND WHO WILL NOT KNOW WHAT I SUFFERED
THIS POOR CREATURE TO WHOM HER MOTHER HAD NEVER SAID YOU ARE MY CHILD EXCEPT TO BID HER NOURISH HER OLD AGE AS SHE HERSELF HAD NOURISHED HER YOUTH WAS CALLED LOUISE AND BEING OBEDIENT TO HER MOTHER SHE ABANDONED HERSELF WITHOUT VOLITION WITHOUT PASSION WITHOUT PLEASURE AS SHE WOULD HAVE WORKED AT ANY OTHER PROFESSION THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAUGHT HER
DEAR CHILD
THESE EMOTIONS WILL BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU ARE RIGHT
HEAVEN WILL RENDER IT BACK TO US WITH USURY
WITH MARGUERITE IT IS STILL MORE CONVENIENT
I DO NOT SAY WHAT I INTEND TO SAY AND AFTER EMBRACING ME SHE FELL INTO A LONG REVERIE
AND I CONTINUED I LEARNED WHAT YOU HAD DONE WITH YOUR HORSES SHAWLS AND JEWELS AND YOU ARE VEXED I AM VEXED THAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO ASK ME FOR WHAT YOU WERE IN WANT OF IN A LIAISON LIKE OURS IF THE WOMAN HAS ANY SENSE OF DIGNITY AT ALL SHE OUGHT TO MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE SACRIFICE RATHER THAN ASK HER LOVER FOR MONEY AND SO GIVE A VENAL CHARACTER TO HER LOVE
WELL SIR SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND NO LONGER TRYING TO HIDE FROM ME THAT HE HAD WEPT AND WAS EVEN THEN ON THE POINT OF WEEPING DO YOU VALUE THIS BOOK VERY GREATLY WHY BECAUSE I HAVE COME TO ASK YOU TO GIVE IT UP TO ME PARDON MY CURIOSITY BUT WAS IT YOU THEN WHO GAVE IT TO MARGUERITE GAUTIER IT WAS THE BOOK IS YOURS SIR
WHEN I THINK THAT IT MAY HAPPEN TO ME NOT TO DIE FOR YOU TO COME BACK FOR ME TO SEE THE SPRING AGAIN FOR YOU STILL TO LOVE ME AND FOR US TO BEGIN OVER AGAIN OUR LAST YEAR'S LIFE
DE N
DE N
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE CROSS SHE SAID
SHE CONSENTED
I FORGOT I WENT HOME LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID DURING THE MOMENT OF JEALOUS DELIRIUM WHICH WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE SHAMEFUL THING I WAS GOING TO DO
TWENTY TIMES I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER DEAD IF I HAD NOT HEARD HER BREATHING PAINFULLY
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK I WAS AT THE VAUDEVILLE
THEY ENTERED A ROOM WITH PERSIAN HANGINGS AND I WAS JUST GOING TO ENTER IN TURN WHEN THEY CAME OUT AGAIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SMILING AND AS IF ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN CURIOSITY
THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO KEEP HER OUT FROM HERE AND THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE A PIECE OF GROUND SOMEWHERE APART FOR THESE SORT OF WOMEN LIKE THERE IS FOR THE POOR
SO MY DEAR ARMAND LET HER ALONE
THEN YOU WILL DRESS ME IN THESE THINGS
HE WAS WITH MARGUERITE FOR FIVE OR SIX MONTHS IN THE COUNTRY
NEXT DAY WHEN YOU WERE AT PARIS WAITING FOR YOUR FATHER AND HE DID NOT RETURN A MAN CAME TO THE DOOR AND HANDED IN A LETTER FROM M
OH MEN HAVE NO PITY
JANUARY 12
EXCESSIVELY TALL AND THIN SHE HAD IN THE FULLEST DEGREE THE ART OF REPAIRING THIS OVERSIGHT OF NATURE BY THE MERE ARRANGEMENT OF THE THINGS SHE WORE
THIS WOMAN IS MINE I LEANED AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE JUST OPPOSITE MARGUERITE AND WATCHED HER DANCING
THIS TIME THE BLOW WAS MORE THAN THE UNHAPPY CREATURE COULD ENDURE WITHOUT REPLYING
THAT IS THE LITTLE VICOMTE DE L
THEY NEVER ALLOW YOU TO WOUND THEIR SELF-ESTEEM
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH ME AND YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND THEM AT THE RISK OF REPROACHING ME FOR IT LATER ON
THESE DETAILS SEEM TO YOU SHOCKING
MY BODY SUCCUMBING TO THE MORAL SHOCK WAS INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT
I WILL WRITE AND TELL MY FATHER NOT TO EXPECT ME NO NO SHE CRIED HASTILY DON'T DO THAT
BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE
IT WOULD BE USELESS FOR THE WORLD TO GROW OLDER IF IT DID NOT CORRECT ITS WAYS
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU ALL THIS ONCE ONLY AT THAT TIME IT WAS MERELY ADVICE AND NOW IT IS ALMOST A NECESSITY WHAT PRUDENCE SAID WAS CRUELLY TRUE
IT WAS OF HIM THAT I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT
DUVAL'S SORROW WAS SYMPATHETIC AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF I FELT THE DESIRE OF DOING HIM A KINDNESS
DESIGN A REGULAR MOUTH WITH LIPS PARTED GRACIOUSLY OVER TEETH AS WHITE AS MILK
SO SHE HAS SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT ME LAST NIGHT OR RATHER TO-NIGHT WHEN YOU AND YOUR FRIEND WENT
I COULD NOT BEHOLD THIS SILENT AND EXPRESSIVE SORROW WITHOUT BEING TOUCHED WHEN I COMPARED IN MY MIND THIS PALE AND WEEPING WOMAN WITH THE MADCAP WHO HAD MADE FUN OF ME AT THE OPERA COMIQUE
I REPLIED IN A HARD VOICE RISING FROM MY SEAT
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR ANYBODY WHO HAD ELBOWED ME AT THAT MOMENT
ACCORDING TO ALL PROBABILITY GOOD-BYE MY FRIEND
OH YOU WOULD BE SORRY FOR ME IF YOU COULD SEE ME
DO NOT TRY TO REUNITE THEM
I MET GASTON AND ASKED AFTER HER
NOW THIS HEROINE IS SO TRUE TO LIFE THAT I FEEL AS IF I HAD KNOWN HER
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT INFLUENCE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER MY LIFE BUT AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT THERE IS NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SISTER IN WHOM I FEEL THE INTEREST WHICH I FEEL IN YOU
IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE
THEY TELL ME THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO RUINED THEMSELVES OVER THAT GIRL AND LOVERS THAT WORSHIPPED HER
WAS MANON TO RECOGNISE IN MARGUERITE IN THE OPINION OF M
THE ROOMS WERE CROWDED WITH PEOPLE
AT SUPPER I STILL HAD NEED OF AID FOR I COULD NOT THINK OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO SO MUCH DID I FEAR THAT MY COURAGE WOULD FAIL ME
IT ALLOWS NEITHER FAMILY NOR AMBITION MAN'S SECOND AND LAST LOVES
WE WILL BE BACK SOON GOOD GOOD
I DID NOT COME TO SPEAK OF THAT
THE RESULT WOULD BE THAT IN A MONTH I SHOULD BE FREE I SHOULD HAVE NO MORE DEBTS AND WE COULD GO AND SPEND THE SUMMER IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME BY WHAT MEANS NO ONLY LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU AND ALL WILL SUCCEED AND HAVE YOU MADE THIS PLAN ALL BY YOURSELF YES AND YOU WILL CARRY IT OUT ALL BY YOURSELF I ALONE SHALL HAVE THE TROUBLE OF IT SAID MARGUERITE WITH A SMILE WHICH I SHALL NEVER FORGET BUT WE SHALL BOTH PARTAKE ITS BENEFITS I COULD NOT HELP FLUSHING AT THE WORD BENEFITS
THE FAMILY OF THE MAN WHO IS TO BECOME MY SON-IN-LAW HAS LEARNED WHAT MANNER OF LIFE ARMAND IS LEADING IN PARIS AND HAS DECLARED TO ME THAT THE MARRIAGE MUST BE BROKEN OFF IF ARMAND CONTINUES THIS LIFE
HE WAS VERY INSISTENT THAT I SHOULD SPEND THE WHOLE EVENING WITH HIM AND NOT GO TILL THE MORNING
DID YOU TELL HIM HOW WE HAD ARRANGED OUR FUTURE YES
I SHALL WAIT FOR YOU AS I ALWAYS DO AND YOU WILL LOVE ME AND WE SHALL BE HAPPY AS WE HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER ALL THESE WORDS WERE SAID IN SUCH A STRAINED VOICE THEY SEEMED TO HIDE SO PERSISTENT AND SO SORROWFUL A THOUGHT THAT I TREMBLED EVERY MOMENT LEST MARGUERITE SHOULD BECOME DELIRIOUS
THAT MY PAST LIFE LEFT ME NO RIGHT TO DREAM OF SUCH A FUTURE AND THAT I WAS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WHICH MY HABITS AND REPUTATION WERE FAR FROM GIVING ANY GUARANTEE
THE MAID ANNOUNCED ME AND I HAD TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES IN THE DRAWING-ROOM
YOU ARE TIED TO IT BY AN IMPOSSIBLE THEORY
HOW MANY OF THE RICHEST AND MOST FASHIONABLE MEN OF THE BEST FAMILIES I HAVE SEEN QUITE READY TO DO WHAT I ADVISE YOU TO DO AND WITHOUT AN EFFORT WITHOUT SHAME WITHOUT REMORSE WHY ONE SEES IT EVERY DAY
YOU WILL BE MURDERED ON THE WAY THERE IS NO DANGER MY DEAR NANINE
LIKE ALL THOSE WHO MOVE IN A CERTAIN SET IN PARIS I KNEW THAT MARGUERITE HAD LIVED WITH SOME OF THE MOST FASHIONABLE YOUNG MEN IN SOCIETY THAT SHE SPOKE OF IT OPENLY AND THAT THEY THEMSELVES BOASTED OF IT
WHAT HAD I TO REPROACH IN HER
WHEN I RETURNED MARGUERITE WAS LYING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND HER TEETH CHATTERED WITH THE COLD
MARGUERITE TOOK THE SIX NOTES OF A THOUSAND FRANCS
BUT IT WOULD BE A POSITION FOR HER WHILE THIS OLD DUKE MIGHT DIE ANY DAY
HERE'S A LETTER EVEN WHICH WAS BROUGHT FOR HER LAST NIGHT AND WHICH I HAVE NOT YET GIVEN HER AND THE PORTER SHOWED ME A LETTER WHICH I GLANCED AT MECHANICALLY
REST IN OUR QUIET FAMILY AFFECTION WILL SOON HEAL YOU OF THIS FEVER FOR IT IS NOTHING ELSE
SHE HAS VERY GOOD REASON NOT TO
PAY HER AS A MAN OF HONOUR IS BOUND TO PAY THE WOMAN WHOM HE KEEPS BY ALL MEANS
OLYMPE RELATED TO ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED DECLARED THAT MARGUERITE SEEING HER ALONE HAD REVENGED HERSELF UPON HER BECAUSE SHE WAS MY MISTRESS AND THAT I MUST WRITE AND TELL HER TO RESPECT THE WOMAN WHOM I LOVED WHETHER I WAS PRESENT OR ABSENT
HOWEVER SHORT A TIME I HAVE TO LIVE I SHALL LIVE LONGER THAN YOU WILL LOVE ME AND SHE WENT SINGING INTO THE DINING-ROOM
ARMAND DUVAL I HAD ALREADY AUTHORIZED PRUDENCE TO DO SO AS FAR AS THAT GOES MADAME I SAID BOWING AND SUCCEEDING IN GETTING MORE OR LESS INTELLIGIBLE SOUNDS OUT OF MY THROAT I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING INTRODUCED TO YOU MARGUERITE'S BEAUTIFUL EYES SEEMED TO BE LOOKING BACK IN MEMORY BUT SHE COULD NOT OR SEEMED NOT TO REMEMBER
HE DID NOT ANSWER
HE WELCOMED ARMAND WITH TEARS OF JOY AND CLASPED MY HAND AFFECTIONATELY
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH
IN SHORT WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPROACH MARGUERITE SENT TO ASK ME FOR A LITTLE PITY SINCE SHE HAD NO LONGER THE MORAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH TO ENDURE WHAT I WAS MAKING HER SUFFER
TWO OR THREE TIMES ALSO SHE SAID YOUR NAME
THEN YOU WILL HAVE A SORRY MISTRESS
SPRING WAS PROFUSE IN ITS FLOWERS ITS LEAVES ITS BIRDS ITS SONGS
I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE CORRIDOR AND I RETURNED TO MY PLACE IN THE STALLS LOOKING HASTILY AROUND TO SEE WHAT BOX SHE WAS IN
YOU WILL DESPISE ME PERHAPS WHILE NOW YOU CAN ONLY HATE ME NO MARGUERITE I CRIED FEELING ALL MY LOVE AND ALL MY DESIRE REAWAKEN AT THE CONTACT OF THIS WOMAN
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR FATHER WAS THE MOST HONEST MAN IN THE WORLD
IT WAS BETTER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS
IT ISN'T ALL FUN CONTINUED PRUDENCE TO LIVE LIKE THAT
A VOLUME BEAUTIFULLY BOUND GILT-EDGED ENTITLED MANON LESCAUT
I SAW A YOUNG MAN BLOND TALL PALE DRESSED IN A TRAVELLING SUIT WHICH LOOKED AS IF HE HAD NOT CHANGED IT FOR SOME DAYS AND HAD NOT EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO BRUSH IT ON ARRIVING AT PARIS FOR IT WAS COVERED WITH DUST
D YOU MUST BE VERY RICH THEN WHY YOU DON'T KNOW THAT I SPEND SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH AND THAT I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT
WELL WHAT IS THE MATTER DO YOU THINK IT AMUSES ME TO WAIT HERE TILL M
MANON LESCAUT IS A TOUCHING STORY
ALL THAT SUPPORTS ME IS THE FEVERISH LIFE I LEAD
I CAME OUT OF MY ROOM
YOU ASK IF I FORGIVE YOU
HER FACE TOO WAS INEXPRESSIBLY VIRGINAL IN ITS EXPRESSION OF INNOCENCE AND OF MELANCHOLY SUFFERING
POOR GIRL SHE IS VERY ILL HE ANSWERED
JESUS WAS FULL OF LOVE FOR SOULS WOUNDED BY THE PASSIONS OF MEN
I WAS IN A HURRY TO GET BACK TO BOUGIVAL TO TELL MARGUERITE ABOUT THIS FORTUNATE CHANGE AND I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK EVERY MOMENT
WELL I'M QUITE IN LOVE WITH THE POOR THING
IN THIS WAY I SHOULD SOON KNOW THE TRUTH AND IF I FOUND A MAN THERE I WOULD STRIKE HIM IN THE FACE
PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE
SAY THIS TO YOURSELF
TWO BIG TEARS FELL FROM HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HOW PALE I WAS
SHE WENT BACK I HEARD AFTERWARD TO HER COUNTRYSIDE GREATLY SADDENED BY HER SISTER'S DEATH BUT WITH A SADNESS WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT LIGHTENED BY THE INVESTMENT AT FOUR AND A HALF PER CENT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
IT IS THROUGH HIM THAT YOU ARE NOT HERE
THEY ASKED FOR THEIR MONEY AND SEIZED SOME OF THE GOODS
WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE IS CONSUMPTIVE AND THE SORT OF LIFE SHE LEADS ISN'T EXACTLY THE THING TO CURE HER
NEVERTHELESS I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD EVER SEE HER AGAIN
GAUTIER THE NAME YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
SHE LEANED ACROSS TO HER NEIGHBOUR AND SAID SOMETHING IN HER EAR AT WHICH BOTH LAUGHED
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE MORE CHARM IN BEAUTY THAN IN THAT OF MARGUERITE
THAT IS ALL THAT ANY ONE ASKS OF YOU
HERE THEY ARE IF YOU WILL LET ME STAY HERE TO-NIGHT AND I THREW THE GOLD ON THE TABLE
I AM GOING TO BOUGIVAL WITH THE DUKE
BUT I FOUND HER APPARENTLY HAPPY SOME ONE ELSE HAD RESTORED TO HER THE LUXURY WHICH I COULD NOT GIVE HER
I AM NOT GOING CHAPTER 16 I MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS LIAISON IN A FEW LINES BUT I WANTED YOU TO SEE EVERY STEP BY WHICH WE CAME I TO AGREE TO WHATEVER MARGUERITE WISHED MARGUERITE TO BE UNABLE TO LIVE APART FROM ME
I HAVE BEEN SPITTING BLOOD ALL THE TIME
I DARED NOT ASK HIM FOR HER ADDRESS AND WENT ON MY WAY
DRESSES CASHMERES JEWELS WERE SOLD WITH INCREDIBLE RAPIDITY
TO REACH SUCH A POINT I MUST HAVE BEEN LITERALLY MAD
SINCE THAT DAY I HAVE NEVER DARED TO DESPISE A WOMAN AT FIRST SIGHT
I COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT MARGUERITE
SHE IS EXPECTING US HE SAID
I WENT OUT
HE KNOWS THAT YOU ARE SURE TO HAVE A MISTRESS AND HE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL THAT IT IS I SINCE I LOVE YOU AND DO NOT WANT MORE OF YOU THAN YOUR POSITION ALLOWS
THE TWO WOMEN WENT FOR A WALK IN THE GARDEN AND WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY CHANGED THE CONVERSATION
SHE CAME ON TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE IN A STATE OF GREAT DELIGHT
I KNEW SAID GASTON THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE US DELIGHTED ISN'T THE WORD REPLIED PRUDENCE AS SHE PUT ON HER HAT AND SHAWL
THERE WAS A FIRST NIGHT AT THE PALAIS ROYAL
AND I HIS FATHER SHOULD RECEIVE FROM ONLY ONE OF MY CHILDREN THE RECOMPENSE THAT I LOOK FOR FROM BOTH
BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE SACRIFICE MADE FOR YOU AND THE TIME OF YOUR RETURN A LONG WHILE ELAPSED DURING WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO PHYSICAL MEANS IN ORDER NOT TO GO MAD AND IN ORDER TO BE BLINDED AND DEAFENED IN THE WHIRL OF LIFE INTO WHICH I FLUNG MYSELF
ARE YOU GOING SAID ERNEST
MY FATHER PROFITED BY THIS TOTAL PROSTRATION OF ALL MY FACULTIES TO DEMAND OF ME A FORMAL PROMISE TO ACCOMPANY HIM
THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT NO
LOVE GIVES ONE A KIND OF GOODNESS
I EXPECTED TO SEE YOU THERE WHY BECAUSE MARGUERITE WAS THERE AH SHE WAS THERE YES
I HAVE PASSED SOME TERRIBLE DAYS
AS IT PASSED ME THE HOPE CAME TO ME THAT MARGUERITE WAS IN IT
BELIEVE MY DOCTOR BUT YOU SEEM QUITE WELL OH
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER
SHE TRIED TO INSULT ME BY HER LOOK
HE OPENED THE DRAWERS WROTE DOWN WHAT HE SAW AND DID NOT EVEN SEEM TO BE AWARE THAT THERE WAS A DYING WOMAN IN THE BED THAT FORTUNATELY THE CHARITY OF THE LAW LEAVES ME
SHE DECLARES THAT SHE HAS SACRIFICED HER POSITION FOR THEM AND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WITH THEM SHE WAS LOSING MONEY
SOME OF THEM I DARE SAY ARE HOPING THAT I SHALL BE THEIR MISTRESS LATER ON
IT WAS QUITE TIME SHE LEFT YOU MY DEAR FELLOW
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
I DID NOT KNOW
I DID NOT KNOW
GAUTIER HAD COME HOME DURING THE DAY
THAT IS HOW THINGS ARE DONE MY DEAR FELLOW AND PRUDENCE APPEARED TO BE ENCHANTED WITH HER ADVICE WHICH I REFUSED INDIGNANTLY
COME COME SAID SHE PUT THESE FOOLISH THEORIES TO FLIGHT AND LAUGH OVER THEM
THAT MLLE
THEY WERE DANCING SHOUTING EVEN AND IN ONE OF THE QUADRILLES I PERCEIVED MARGUERITE DANCING WITH THE COMTE DE N WHO SEEMED PROUD OF SHOWING HER OFF AS IF HE SAID TO EVERYBODY
THE ANSWER THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT TO MARGUERITE HAD PUT HER INTO A GOOD HUMOUR
WHEN THE FUNERAL STARTED ON THE WAY TO MONTMARTRE ONLY TWO MEN FOLLOWED IT
BUT THOUGH THE LIFE OF SUCH WOMEN MAKES SENSATION ENOUGH THEIR DEATH MAKES VERY LITTLE
SINCE THEN SHE HAS NOT SAID A WORD OR MADE A MOVEMENT
IT SHOWED ME THAT YOU LACKED THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE HEART
I WOULD HAVE CRIED LIKE A CHILD WHO SEES THE CASTLE HE HAS BEEN DREAMING ABOUT VANISH AWAY AS HE AWAKENS FROM SLEEP
I DID NOT SPEAK A WORD
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM THINKING OF NO OF A PLAN THAT HAS COME INTO MY HEAD AND WHAT IS THIS PLAN I CAN'T TELL YOU YET BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE
MY FATHER WAS CHARMING ALL DINNER TIME
WHEN THE DAY DAWNED I WAS STILL SLEEPLESS
COME IN AND WELCOME CHAPTER 9 GOOD-EVENING MY DEAR GASTON SAID MARGUERITE TO MY COMPANION
WHAT DOES HE DO HE HAS TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AH INDEED
ARE YOU GOING ALREADY YES I FEAR I AM BORING YOU YOU ARE NOT BORING ME TO-DAY MORE THAN ANY OTHER DAY
THE WEATHER IS HORRIBLE
FAITH IS REFASHIONED RESPECT FOR SACRED THINGS HAS RETURNED TO US AND IF THE WORLD HAS NOT ALL AT ONCE BECOME GOOD IT HAS AT LEAST BECOME BETTER
ONE OF THE GRAVE-DIGGERS TOOK A SHOVEL AND BEGAN EMPTYING OUT THE EARTH
I AM TIRED OUT WITH SEEING PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS WANT THE SAME THING
I FORGOT THAT I HAD BEEN HIS MISTRESS AND HE TRIED TO MAKE ME FORGET IT TOO
I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM ABROAD
YOU MUST BE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HE WENT ON SIGHING SADLY FOR WHAT PURPOSE AN UNKNOWN VISITOR AT SUCH AN HOUR IN SUCH A COSTUME AND IN TEARS CAN HAVE COME TO SEE YOU
WOULD YOU NOT-SUFFER ON SEEING THE HINDRANCES SET BY YOUR LOVE TO YOUR LOVER'S LIFE HINDRANCES FOR WHICH YOU WOULD BE POWERLESS TO CONSOLE HIM IF WITH AGE THOUGHTS OF AMBITION SHOULD SUCCEED TO DREAMS OF LOVE
THERE IS A THAW AND THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT I MAY GO OUT IN A FEW DAYS IF THE FINE WEATHER CONTINUES
I WAS ILL FOR A FORTNIGHT OR I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED LONG AGO
I HAVE GIVEN HIM A TALKING TO AND HE HAS PROMISED TO BE REASONABLE WELL AND GOOD IN SPITE OF MYSELF I GLANCED AT THE BED
I THINK THAT NOW THAT I HAVE TASTED OF ANOTHER LIFE I SHOULD DIE IF I WENT BACK TO THE OLD ONE
COME LEAVE THIS WOMAN
I COULD NOT BE INDIFFERENT TO WHAT SHE DID CONSEQUENTLY WHAT WOULD HURT HER THE MOST WOULD BE MY INDIFFERENCE
MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY
BUT HE CAN NOT ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE BECAUSE THE WORLD WHICH DOES NOT KNOW YOU WOULD GIVE A WRONG INTERPRETATION TO THIS ACCEPTANCE AND SUCH AN INTERPRETATION MUST NOT TARNISH THE NAME WHICH WE BEAR
HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
GASTON STOPPED
I DIVINED RATHER THAN RECOGNISED IT
THE FACT IS MY FRIEND THAT WHEN THIS PARIS LIFE WHICH SEEMS TO MAKE ME SO HAPPY DOESN'T BURN ME IT WEARIES ME AND THEN I HAVE SUDDEN ASPIRATIONS TOWARD A CALMER EXISTENCE WHICH MIGHT RECALL MY CHILDHOOD
THIS OLYMPE WHOM I HAD SEEN WAS IF NOT A FRIEND OF MARGUERITE AT ALL EVENTS THE WOMAN WITH WHOM SHE WAS MOST OFTEN SEEN SINCE HER RETURN TO PARIS
THEY ARE HARD
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING
I OBEYED NOT THE INSTINCTS OF A LIGHT WOMAN AS YOU SEEM TO SAY BUT A SERIOUS NECESSITY AND REASONS WHICH YOU WILL KNOW ONE DAY AND WHICH WILL MAKE YOU FORGIVE ME WHY DO YOU NOT TELL ME THOSE REASONS TO-DAY BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BRING ABOUT AN IMPOSSIBLE REUNION BETWEEN US AND THEY WOULD SEPARATE YOU PERHAPS FROM THOSE FROM WHOM YOU MUST NOT BE SEPARATED WHO DO YOU MEAN I CAN NOT TELL YOU THEN YOU ARE LYING TO ME MARGUERITE ROSE AND WENT TOWARD THE DOOR
IT WAS QUITE TIME SHE SAID
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I SOMETIMES SPEND TWO HOURS OF THE MORNING OVER IT
THEN WE CALLED ON JULIE DUPRAT WHO TOLD US THE SAD INCIDENT WHICH SHE HAD WITNESSED SHEDDING REAL TEARS AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER FRIEND
I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE REASONS WHICH HAD FILLED MY MIND BEFORE I SLEPT
GAUTIER'S SISTER AND YOU MAY BE SURE HIS FIRST VISIT WILL BE FOR ME WE HAD COME TO THE CEMETERY GATE
NOW YOU ARE CONVINCED
WHY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME I LOVE YOU ALWAYS AND I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE TO TURN ME OUT TO-MORROW
DE VOLTAIRE HAPPILY EXIST NO LONGER TO THOSE WHO LIKE MYSELF REALIZE THAT HUMANITY FOR THESE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS BEEN IN ONE OF ITS MOST AUDACIOUS MOMENTS OF EXPANSION
WELL IT IS TO PREVENT YOU FROM RUINING YOURSELF FOR A PROSTITUTE THAT I AM NOW IN PARIS
SHE WOULD CRY A LITTLE AT THE BEGINNING BUT SHE WOULD COME TO ACCUSTOM HERSELF TO IT AND YOU WOULD THANK ME ONE DAY FOR WHAT YOU HAD DONE
THE CURTAINS WERE HERMETICALLY CLOSED AND FOR A MOMENT THE EXTERNAL WORLD DID NOT EXIST FOR US
BUT I HAVE REALLY SOMETHING TO SEE HER ABOUT TO-DAY AND I AM BRINGING HER AN ANSWER NOW AT THIS MOMENT MARGUERITE REAPPEARED FROM HER DRESSING-ROOM WEARING A COQUETTISH LITTLE NIGHTCAP WITH BUNCHES OF YELLOW RIBBONS TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS CABBAGES SHE LOOKED RAVISHING
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD WAIT ANOTHER HOUR BUT THAT AT TWO O'CLOCK IF MARGUERITE HAD NOT RETURNED I WOULD SET OUT FOR PARIS
THIS MAN WANTED HIS MONEY
THE WEATHER IS DARK I AM SAD
THE SISTER OPENED HER EYES VERY WIDE WHEN THE LAWYER WROTE TO HER THAT SHE HAD INHERITED 50,000 FRANCS
WE WALKED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF MARGUERITE'S GRAVE
SHE CAME UP TO PARIS IN HASTE AND GREAT WAS THE ASTONISHMENT OF THOSE WHO HAD KNOWN MARGUERITE WHEN THEY SAW AS HER ONLY HEIR A FINE FAT COUNTRY GIRL WHO UNTIL THEN HAD NEVER LEFT HER VILLAGE
YES WELL LET US GO TO BOUGIVAL AT THE POINT DU JOUR AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S
HE IS SO DULL
YOUR SON'S WELFARE I ANSWERED
HE SEEMED MUCH EMBARRASSED BY THE DELICATE MISSION WHICH M
HE INTRODUCED ME TO HIS FRIENDS WHO GAVE A SUPPER IN MY HONOUR AFTER WHICH ONE OF THEM TOOK ME HOME WITH HIM
WHO KNOWS
JOSEPH RETURNED
YOU ARE HAPPY NO DOUBT HAVE I THE FACE OF A HAPPY WOMAN ARMAND
OR YOU WOULD BE AN HONEST MAN AND FEELING BOUND TO KEEP HER BY YOU YOU WOULD BRING INEVITABLE TROUBLE UPON YOURSELF FOR A LIAISON WHICH IS EXCUSABLE IN A YOUNG MAN IS NO LONGER EXCUSABLE IN A MAN OF MIDDLE AGE
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HAD NO LOVER
THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING
THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT
I RECALLED THE STORY AND HAVING LONGED TO SUFFER FOR THIS WOMAN I WAS AFRAID THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT ME TOO PROMPTLY AND GIVE ME AT ONCE WHAT I FAIN WOULD HAVE PURCHASED BY LONG WAITING OR SOME GREAT SACRIFICE
I WILL GO AND SAY HOW DO YOU DO TO HER HE SAID AND WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT I COULD NOT HELP SAYING HAPPY MAN WHY TO GO AND SEE THAT WOMAN ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER NO I SAID FLUSHING FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
SHE CAME BACK CRYING
TO WHOM ARE YOU WRITING I ASKED
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO MAKE OUT OUR HEROINE TO BE ANYTHING BUT WHAT SHE WAS
I LISTENED AT THE DOOR TRYING TO DISCOVER A SOUND A MOVEMENT
COME ENOUGH OF THIS
MY DEAR ARMAND:--I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR LETTER
WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
I CAN NOT LEAVE PARIS FOR SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT PUTTING MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND THE AFFAIRS OF A WOMAN LIKE ME ARE ALWAYS IN GREAT CONFUSION
WHERE AT HOME YOU KNOW THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP THERE WELL THEN IT WON'T DO FOR YOU TO COME AND BE PETTISH HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN A MAN IN MY BOX IT IS NOT FOR THAT REASON YES IT IS
THIS SHROUD WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY EATEN AWAY AT ONE END AND LEFT ONE OF THE FEET VISIBLE
A LADY WHO WAS STARTING WITH HER MAID IN THE NEXT MAIL FOR BOULOGNE AND WHO TOLD ME NOT TO TAKE IT UNTIL THE COACH WAS OUT OF THE COURTYARD I RUSHED TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
HOWEVER WE FINALLY FOUND IN ONE OF THE QUIETEST PARTS OF PARIS A LITTLE HOUSE ISOLATED FROM THE MAIN PART OF THE BUILDING
CHAPTER 24 IT WAS SOMETHING ALREADY BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH
MADAME LEFT FOR ENGLAND AT SIX O'CLOCK SAID THE PORTER
NO MY FRIEND NO
THE WEATHER WAS LOVELY
FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
TOLD ME THAT MY REFUSAL WOULD ANNOY M
THEN CONTINUED MARGUERITE YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON BEFORE WHOM IT SEEMED TO ME FROM THE FIRST THAT I COULD THINK AND SPEAK FREELY
I AM ILL
EVERY MANON CAN HAVE HER OWN DES GRIEUX AND TIMES ARE CHANGED
HIS CANDLES WERE BURNED OUT
CHAPTER 10 THE ROOM TO WHICH SHE HAD FLED WAS LIT ONLY BY A SINGLE CANDLE
NO WE WILL HAVE SUPPER HERE SHE RANG AND NANINE APPEARED
PARDON ME I DID NOT REFLECT HOW LITTLE MY SORROW MUST MEAN TO YOU AND THAT I AM INTRUDING UPON YOU SOMETHING WHICH CAN NOT AND OUGHT NOT TO INTEREST YOU AT ALL YOU MISTAKE MY MEANING
ALL THE TIME THAT MY SERVANT WAS AWAY I WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME AGITATION
THROWING HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK SHE SAID TO ME
I PAY DOUBLE FOR IT NOW
NOT ONLY MY LOVE AND MY DIGNITY WOULD NOT LET ME ACT THUS BUT I WAS CERTAIN THAT FEELING AS SHE DID NOW MARGUERITE WOULD DIE RATHER THAN ACCEPT ANOTHER LOVER
THIS IS HOW IT IS SHE WENT ON PUTTING AWAY THE PAPERS SHE HAD JUST SHOWN ME
I WISH I WERE A FRIEND A RELATION OF YOURS THAT I MIGHT KEEP YOU FROM DOING YOURSELF HARM LIKE THIS AH
SHE WAS ALWAYS ALONE WHEN SHE DROVE IN THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES LYING BACK IN HER CARRIAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE DRESSED IN FURS IN WINTER AND IN SUMMER WEARING VERY SIMPLE DRESSES
WHEN NANINE HAD GONE OUT MARGUERITE SAT DOWN BY ME AGAIN AND SAID TAKING MY HAND
GASTON KNEW THE SONG AND THEY GAVE A SORT OF DUET
I HAVE DONE ALL I COULD NANINE CRIED MARGUERITE
WELL WILL YOU TAKE MY PASSPORT AND ASK IF THERE ARE ANY LETTERS FOR ME AT THE POSTE RESTANTE
DUVAL WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT THE LEAST I CAN DO IS TO GIVE YOU IN RETURN THE PRICE WHICH YOU PAID FOR IT ALLOW ME TO OFFER IT TO YOU
AND THEN WHAT IS THE GOOD OF KILLING ONESELF WHEN ONE IS SO NEAR DYING ALREADY
IT IS ALL I CAN DO FOR THEM LISTEN MARGUERITE I SAID UNABLE TO CONTAIN MYSELF ANY LONGER
IT IS SHE CONTINUED TAKING MY HAND AND PLACING IT AGAINST HER HEART SO THAT I COULD FEEL HOW RAPIDLY AND VIOLENTLY IT PALPITATED
WELL HE HAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN BRAIN FEVER AND VERY LUCKY IT IS FOR HIM FOR I FIRMLY BELIEVE GOD FORGIVE ME THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT OF HIS MIND
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS SETTING OUT ON A TOUR IN THE EAST
PRUDENCE RANG
AT LAST MARGUERITE GAVE UP GOING TO BALLS OR THEATRES FOR FEAR OF MEETING OLYMPE AND ME
FIFTEEN I SAID
WHAT YOU ASK OF ME IS BEYOND MY POWER
I LOOKED AT ONE AFTER ANOTHER EACH RECALLING A SEPARATE SHAME AND I SAID THAT GOD HAD BEEN MERCIFUL TO THE POOR CHILD IN NOT HAVING LEFT HER TO PAY THE ORDINARY PENALTY BUT RATHER TO DIE IN THE MIDST OF HER BEAUTY AND LUXURY BEFORE THE COMING OF OLD AGE THE COURTESAN'S FIRST DEATH
BUT THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO FORGET THE MOST SACRED THINGS FOR HER THAT YOU SHOULD LET THE REPORT OF YOUR SCANDALOUS LIFE REACH MY QUIET COUNTRYSIDE AND SET A BLOT ON THE HONOURABLE NAME THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU IT CAN NOT IT SHALL NOT BE PERMIT ME TO TELL YOU FATHER THAT THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN YOU INFORMATION ABOUT ME HAVE BEEN ILL-INFORMED
YOU KNOW I HAVE THE BAD HABIT OF TRYING TO EMBARRASS PEOPLE THE FIRST TIME I MEET THEM
WHAT HE SAID LOOKING AT ME AS IF HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME
I DRANK FOR FORGETFULNESS AND WHEN I WOKE NEXT DAY I WAS BESIDE THE COUNT
MY SON HAS NO FORTUNE AND YET HE IS READY TO ABANDON TO YOU THE LEGACY OF HIS MOTHER
AND I AM SURE THAT IF SHE DID ASK FOR MORE DESPITE HIS HEALTH AND THE AFFECTION HE HAS FOR HER HE WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO HER
THE DUKE GIVES HER ALL THAT SHE ASKS FOR BUT SHE DOES NOT ALWAYS VENTURE TO ASK HIM FOR ALL THAT SHE IS IN WANT OF
OLYMPE AND PITY FOR WHAT YOU ARE PERHAPS STILL READY TO DO TO ME
I WAS LOST IN CONTEMPLATION
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY
BUT I HAD SCARCELY GOT THERE WHEN I TOOK THIS FEVER AND I WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP MY ROOM AND YOU STARTED TO COME BACK BEFORE YOU WERE REALLY WELL IF I HAD REMAINED IN THE PLACE FOR ANOTHER WEEK I SHOULD HAVE DIED THERE WELL NOW YOU ARE BACK AGAIN YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
HE HAS ALWAYS GIVEN HER A LOT OF MONEY
BUT I GREATLY FEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO INFLUENCE UPON MY SON OH BE AT REST SIR
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN REASSURING HER AND SHE SENT ME AWAY IN THE MORNING WITH AN INSISTENT DISQUIETUDE THAT I COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO MYSELF
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND MY SILENCE HE OPENED THE LETTERS GUESSED AT RATHER THAN READ THEM FOR EACH WAS OF FOUR PAGES
DO NOT LET US DESPISE THE WOMAN WHO IS NEITHER MOTHER SISTER MAID NOR WIFE
WHAT OUR POOR FRIEND SUFFERS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
YOU DON'T KNOW MY POOR FRIEND THAT I SHOULD RUIN YOU IN NO TIME AND THAT YOUR FAMILY WOULD CAST YOU OFF IF YOU WERE TO LIVE WITH A WOMAN LIKE ME
PUT IT ALL ON THE LITTLE TABLE AND DRAW IT UP TO THE BED
SUCH A COLLECTION COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN GOT TOGETHER LITTLE BY LITTLE AND THE SAME LOVER HAD CERTAINLY NOT BEGUN AND ENDED IT
OF THE PLACE I NOW HAD IN HER THOUGHTS OF THE KEY TO HER ROOM WHICH I HAD IN MY POCKET AND OF MY RIGHT TO USE THIS KEY I WAS SATISFIED WITH LIFE PROUD OF MYSELF AND I LOVED GOD BECAUSE HE HAD LET SUCH THINGS BE
IT IS LIKELY TO MAKE YOU WORSE THAN YOU ARE NOW IT IS MY ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING BETTER
LET US LEAVE ON OUR WAY THE ALMS OF PARDON FOR THOSE WHOM EARTHLY DESIRES HAVE DRIVEN ASTRAY WHOM A DIVINE HOPE SHALL PERHAPS SAVE AND AS OLD WOMEN SAY WHEN THEY OFFER YOU SOME HOMELY REMEDY OF THEIR OWN IF IT DOES NO GOOD IT WILL DO NO HARM
I WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT COMPLETELY ABSORBED BY THE GAME AND ABLE TO PAY HER SOME ATTENTION
WHAT ASTONISHES ME IS THAT TWENTY TIMES GREATER FOLLIES ARE NOT COMMITTED FOR THEM
I MET ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE I KNEW ALL HAPPY ALL ABSORBED IN THEIR PLEASURES
YOU CAN NOT ALWAYS LOVE THIS WOMAN WHO ALSO CAN NOT ALWAYS LOVE YOU
NO ONE WILL BELIEVE IT BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE INTERESTING TO DO YOU WILL TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT LATER ON MY FRIEND I SAID TO HIM
THAT IS WHY I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THEY OCCURRED IN THE FEAR IF A LONG TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN THEM AND YOUR RETURN THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM TO YOU WITH ALL THEIR MELANCHOLY EXACTITUDE
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE CAME TO BRING ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS FROM YOUR FATHER
THEY HAD READ THE PLACARDS THEY WISHED TO SEE WHAT THE PLACARDS HAD ANNOUNCED AND TO MAKE THEIR CHOICE BEFOREHAND
I OPENED THE DOOR
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU FOR TEN MINUTES SAID MARGUERITE FROM HER WINDOW IN ALMOST AN IMPERIOUS TONE OF VOICE
I HAVE NOT A LARGE ENOUGH FORTUNE TO ACCEPT SUCH A SACRIFICE
I HAVE NO DEBTS
HIS DAUGHTER NAMED BLANCHE HAD THAT TRANSPARENCE OF EYES THAT SERENITY OF THE MOUTH WHICH INDICATES A SOUL THAT CONCEIVES ONLY HOLY THOUGHTS AND LIPS THAT REPEAT ONLY PIOUS WORDS
CHAPTER 13 YOU HAVE COME ALMOST AS QUICKLY AS WE SAID PRUDENCE
YOU COULD SEE SHE WAS STILL IN THE VIRGINITY OF VICE
IT WAS RIDICULOUS SHE WILL BE VERY GLAD TO FIND THAT YOU TAKE IT SO WELL
SHE IS PROBABLY ALONE BUT SHE MUST BE DREADFULLY BORED SAID GASTON
THE MEETING THE INTRODUCTION THE PROMISE OF MARGUERITE HAD FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER SO RAPIDLY AND SO UNEXPECTEDLY THAT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IT SEEMED TO ME I HAD BEEN DREAMING
THIS MINGLING OF GAIETY SADNESS CANDOUR PROSTITUTION HER VERY MALADY WHICH NO DOUBT DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSITIVENESS TO IMPRESSIONS AS WELL AS AN IRRITABILITY OF NERVES ALL THIS MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT IF FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I DID NOT COMPLETELY DOMINATE HER LIGHT AND FORGETFUL NATURE SHE WAS LOST TO ME
IF THEY COULD SEE WHAT SICKNESS HAS MADE OF ME THEY WOULD GO AWAY IN TERROR
FORGIVE ME FOR THE FEW TEDIOUS HOURS THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE HAPPY MOMENTS WHICH I OWE TO YOU
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED TO-DAY TO ASK AFTER YOU BUT I INTEND GOING BACK TO MY FATHER'S
I HAD TO REPEAT TWICE OVER EVERYTHING I SAID TO HER TO OBTAIN AN ANSWER
NEVERTHELESS I WAS BEGINNING TO GET USED TO HER WAYS AND I DID NOT LEAVE HER AS I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DONE ONCE
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE SAID THAT I MARGUERITE GAUTIER WOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF A NEW LOVER
HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD
I SHOULD HAVE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND THAT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE AROUSED HER SUSPICIONS FOR FINDING THAT I DID NOT KEEP MY APPOINTMENT SHE WOULD HAVE INQUIRED THE REASON OF MY ABSENCE AND ONLY THEN I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO HER
WOMEN SOMETIMES ALLOW YOU TO BE UNFAITHFUL TO THEIR LOVE
ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU
MARGUERITE'S NATURE WAS VERY CAPRICIOUS AND LIKE SO MANY WOMEN SHE NEVER REGARDED AS A SERIOUS EXPENSE THOSE THOUSAND AND ONE DISTRACTIONS WHICH MADE UP HER LIFE
THE COUNT REDDENED AND BIT HIS LIPS
INSTEAD OF LUNCHING AT THE CAFE FOY AT THE CORNER OF THE BOULEVARD AS I USUALLY DID I PREFERRED TO GO TO THE PALAIS ROYAL AND SO PASS THROUGH THE RUE D'ANTIN
BE HAPPY WITH HER AND FORGET ME AND YOU
SHE HAD CHANGED AS I HAVE TOLD YOU AND NO LONGER WORE AN INDIFFERENT SMILE ON HER LIPS
WELL I SAID TO THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD EXAMINED THE PATIENT
WELL OTHER LOVERS MAKE UP FOR THE REST OF HER EXPENSES
WE WILL GO AFTER THIS PIECE IS OVER FOR I KNOW THE LAST PIECE WITH PLEASURE
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU ASK TOO MUCH YOU ARE RIGHT BUT I CAN'T HELP IT
THAT NOW THAT YOU HAVE LET ME COME TO SEE YOU NOW THAT I KNOW YOU NOW THAT I KNOW ALL THAT IS STRANGE IN YOU YOU HAVE BECOME A NECESSITY OF MY LIFE AND YOU WILL DRIVE ME MAD NOT ONLY IF YOU WILL NOT LOVE ME BUT IF YOU WILL NOT LET ME LOVE YOU BUT FOOLISH CREATURE THAT YOU ARE I SHALL SAY TO YOU LIKE MME
A KIND OF CONSOLATION HAD SPRUNG FROM THE CERTAINTY OF WHICH HE WAS NOW FULLY PERSUADED AND IN ORDER TO BANISH THE SOMBRE PICTURE WHICH OFTEN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM HE RETURNED UPON THE HAPPY RECOLLECTIONS OF HIS LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND SEEMED RESOLVED TO THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
THE OLD DUKE IS AT YOUR NEIGHBOURS I SAID TO PRUDENCE
AND IT ISN'T ONLY THE QUESTION OF HIS TAKING A HOUSE FOR ME BUT HE HAS MY DEBTS TO PAY AND UNLUCKILY I HAVE PLENTY
THIS MORNING I WAS AWAKENED BY A GREAT NOISE
NO MISFORTUNE HAS YET ARRIVED BUT ONE WILL ARRIVE AND PERHAPS A GREATER ONE THAN THOSE WHICH I FORESEE
BE FRANK WELL IT IS TRUE I HAVE WON THREE HUNDRED LOUIS
I WAS ONLY A WOMAN AND WHEN I SAW YOU AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP WEEPING BUT I DID NOT GIVE WAY
I WAS FIRMER BEFORE THESE THREATS THAN BEFORE HIS ENTREATIES
WAS MARGUERITE DECEIVING ME
FROM TIME TO TIME SHE UTTERED A CRY STARTED UP AND AFTER ASSURING HERSELF THAT I WAS BESIDE HER MADE ME SWEAR THAT I WOULD ALWAYS LOVE HER
THIS SUPPOSITION WOULD HAVE SEEMED PROBABLE ENOUGH IN MOST INSTANCES BUT IN ARMAND'S DESPAIR THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCENT OF REAL SINCERITY AND GOING FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER I IMAGINED THAT DISTRESS HAD BROUGHT ON AN ILLNESS AND THAT MY NOT SEEING HIM WAS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE WAS ILL PERHAPS DEAD
HE WILL REMIND YOU OF MY PAST LIFE AND WILL PERHAPS DO ME THE HONOUR OF INVENTING SOME NEW STORY SO THAT YOU MAY GIVE ME UP YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU YES BUT WHAT I KNOW TOO IS THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL HAVE TO OBEY YOUR FATHER AND PERHAPS YOU WILL END BY BELIEVING HIM NO MARGUERITE
YOU ARE MAD REPLIED MARGUERITE
ARMAND DUVAL
ARMAND DUVAL
THE POOR OLD MAN IS ALWAYS ON THE WATCH
FORTUNATELY THE ANTEROOM WAS IN HALF DARKNESS AND THE CHANGE IN MY COUNTENANCE WAS LESS VISIBLE
I CAME AT ELEVEN AT NIGHT TO ASK AFTER YOU AND WAS TOLD THAT YOU HAD NOT COME IN
MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN
THE DOCTOR BEGGED HER TO SEE A PRIEST
AT LAST THE GARDENER CAME
A ONE OF THE MOST MELANCHOLY EXAMPLES OF OUR MODERN COURTESAN
HE SEEMED TO WALK BY A SERIES OF JERKS
ISN'T IT SIR CERTAINLY I REPLIED STILL UNDER THE EXCITEMENT OF MARGUERITE'S LAST WORDS MY EYES FIXED ARDENTLY UPON HER
A DAY'S INTERVAL HAD BEEN LEFT BETWEEN THE VISITING DAYS AND THE SALE IN ORDER TO GIVE TIME FOR TAKING DOWN THE HANGINGS CURTAINS ETC
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT TWELVE TO HAVING LUNCH WITH YOU AND WIPING OUT BY SEEING YOU A THOUGHT WHICH WAS WITH ME INCESSANTLY AND WHICH BEFORE I KNEW YOU I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN TOLERATING
THERE HAS BEEN SOME ONE TO WATCH BY ME EVERY NIGHT
BY THE HELP OF THIS FABLE WHICH MME
THIS DAILY LOOKING BACK ON THE ONLY HAPPY MOMENTS OF MY LIFE DOES ME AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF GOOD AND IF YOU WILL FIND IN READING IT SOME EXCUSE FOR THE PAST
COME YOU WILL GO WITH ME ARMAND WILL YOU NOT I FELT THAT MY FATHER WOULD BE RIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN ANY OTHER WOMAN BUT I WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS WRONG WITH REGARD TO MARGUERITE
WHERE IS NANINE SHE SAID SEEING GASTON AND PRUDENCE ALONE
JANUARY 4
THEN FLUNG HERSELF INTO MY ARMS AND HIDING HER HEAD IN MY BOSOM SAID TO ME
I WROTE ALL THAT TO ARMAND BUT ABSORBED IN YOU HE MADE NO REPLY
THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW HER WAS IN THE PLACE DE LA BOURSE OUTSIDE SUSSE'S
ONE HAS ALWAYS HAD A CHILDHOOD WHATEVER ONE BECOMES
OLYMPE HAS TAKEN MY PLACE WITH THE COMTE DE N AND HAS TOLD HIM I HEAR THE REASONS FOR MY LEAVING HIM
HE REMAINED WITH ME THREE HOURS AND DID NOT SAY TWENTY WORDS
I SHOWED HIM THE PAWN TICKETS THE RECEIPTS OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM I HAD SOLD WHAT I COULD NOT PAWN
THINK OVER ALL THAT MADAME
GO AND SEE THEM
DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY FRIEND
SHE WOULDN'T
GIVE ME A DRESSING-GOWN
LOOK AT THAT PRETTY GIRL AT THAT MOMENT MARGUERITE TURNED HER OPERA-GLASS IN OUR DIRECTION AND SEEING MY FRIEND SMILED AND BECKONED TO HIM TO COME TO HER
IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL I ENDURED A MARTYRDOM
YOU KNOW QUITE WELL THAT I DON'T WANT YOU
THEREUPON SHE WENT WILD WITH DELIGHT
WHEN SHE HEARD YOU ANNOUNCED SHE MADE HER ESCAPE
I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING IT BUT I CAN NOT GET USED TO THE THOUGHT OF SUFFERING MORE THAN I SUFFER NOW AND IF AFTER THIS THE FEW CHARACTERS TRACED BY MARGUERITE WERE INDECIPHERABLE AND WHAT FOLLOWED WAS WRITTEN BY JULIE DUPRAT
THEN I BEGAN TO BELIEVE WITH THE SUPERSTITION WHICH PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY ARE WAITING THAT IF I WENT OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE I SHOULD FIND AN ANSWER WHEN I GOT BACK
HE SMILED AND HELD OUT HIS HAND
CHAPTER 3 AT ONE O'CLOCK ON THE 16TH I WENT TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER
I HAD THIS PORTRAIT BY ME FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER HER DEATH AND THE LIKENESS WAS SO ASTONISHING THAT IT HAS HELPED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY IN REGARD TO SOME POINTS WHICH I MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE REMEMBERED
HOWEVER HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY
I SHALL HAVE TO GO SHE GOT UP AND SAID TO ME WAIT HERE SHE WENT THROUGH THE ROOMS AND I HEARD HER OPEN THE OUTER DOOR
ANXIETY THE NIGHT WALK AND THE MORNING'S NEWS HAD PROSTRATED ME
HER BREAKING WITH ME SEEMED TO ASSUME A CHARACTER OF THE BASEST SELF-INTEREST
SCENES OF THIS KIND OFTEN TOOK PLACE AND THOUGH I COULD NOT DISCOVER THEIR CAUSE I COULD NOT FAIL TO SEE IN MARGUERITE SIGNS OF DISQUIETUDE IN REGARD TO THE FUTURE
THE MARBLE SLAB STOOD UPRIGHT AN IRON RAILING MARKED THE LIMITS OF THE GROUND PURCHASED AND THE EARTH WAS COVERED WITH WHITE CAMELLIAS
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT I COULD COMPARE A CARRIAGE AND DIAMONDS WITH YOUR LOVE
IT IS FOR SUCH REASONS AS THIS THAT CERTAIN PEOPLE SAY TO YOU
IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH THE MIDST OF A DEAD CITY
SHE LOOKED AT ME ANXIOUSLY
IT IS CERTAINLY THE FACT THAT SHE MADE A VERY DEFINITE IMPRESSION UPON ME THAT MANY OF MY FRIENDS HAD NOTICED IT AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN MUCH AMUSED WHEN THEY SAW WHO IT WAS THAT MADE THIS IMPRESSION UPON ME
SHE'S JUST TWENTY AND WHEN A GIRL OF THAT AGE COMES HERE I THINK OF HER AND I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A GREAT LADY OR A VAGABOND I CAN'T HELP FEELING IT A BIT
ARMAND MIGHT BECOME JEALOUS OF A MAN WHO HAS LOVED YOU
WHO PAY ME FOR IT AND THEN THINK THEY ARE QUIT OF ME
JUDGING FROM THE THOUGHTS WHICH FILLED MY BRAIN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG NIGHT FOR ARMAND
I WANTED TO REFUSE AT FIRST BUT M
AT FIVE I HASTENED TO THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
ADIEU MADAME MARGUERITE ROSE
THE FRIEND WHO HAD INTRODUCED ME DID NOT WISH TO LET ME REMAIN IN SO RIDICULOUS A POSITION
WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THAT MOURNFUL PLEASURE WHICH WE FIND IN SIGHTS OF THIS KIND
THEY HAVE OUR LAST NIGHT'S BOUQUETS AND THEY BORROW OUR SHAWLS
I SHALL NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH I EXPECT TO HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING THE HAND WHICH HAS WRITTEN THE KIND LETTER I HAVE JUST RECEIVED
IS THIS GENTLEMAN'S PRESENCE STILL NECESSARY I SAID POINTING TO ARMAND
THERE IS SOMETHING WRITTEN ON THE FIRST PAGE
MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME
BUT SHE WOULD BE A CHARMING MISTRESS TO HAVE HAPPILY THE CURTAIN ROSE AND MY FRIEND WAS SILENT
IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE AND THAT MARGUERITE AND I CONTINUED TO LIVE TOGETHER WITHOUT GIVING A THOUGHT TO THE FUTURE
NO SINGLE FORTUNE HOWEVER LARGE COULD SUFFICE FOR THE EXPENSES OF A WOMAN LIKE MARGUERITE
ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED
I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME
THE CURTAIN OPENED A FAINT LIGHT MADE ITS WAY IN
BUT IF YOU LIKE IT TAKE IT PRUDENCE ONLY SAW THE PRESENT NOT THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS GIVEN
IT WAS NOT YOU WHO WERE ABSURD
THE COMTE DE N IF SHE WOULD TAKE HIM HE TOLD ME YESTERDAY EVEN WOULD PAY ALL HER DEBTS AND GIVE HER FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH
MARGUERITE WANTED TO SELL EVERYTHING BUT IT WAS TOO LATE AND BESIDES I SHOULD HAVE OPPOSED IT
SUDDENLY ONE OF THE TWO PICKAXES STRUCK AGAINST A STONE
WE HAD SCARCELY OPENED THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE STALLS WHEN WE HAD TO STAND ASIDE TO ALLOW MARGUERITE AND THE DUKE TO PASS
THE DOCTORS TELL ME THAT THE BLOOD I SPIT UP COMES FROM MY THROAT
AT LENGTH SOMETHING WHICH I HAD FEARED AND FORESEEN HAPPENED
BRING SOME FRUIT TOO AND A PATE OR A WING OF CHICKEN
I SEEM AS IF I AM BETTER IN SPITE OF THE FEELING OF SADNESS UNDER THE IMPRESSION OF WHICH I REPLIED TO YOU
OR RATHER I AM WRONG IT IS GOD WHO IS JUST AND INFLEXIBLE
YOUR FATHER HAD WRITTEN ME A VERY POLITE LETTER IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT CONSENT TO SEE HIM
CHAPTER 23 WHEN THE CURRENT OF LIFE HAD RESUMED ITS COURSE I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DAY WHICH I SAW DAWNING WOULD NOT BE LIKE THOSE WHICH HAD PRECEDED IT
I REACHED BOUGIVAL AT ELEVEN
I TOLD HIM OF MY RESOLVE TO PART WITH MY FURNITURE IN ORDER TO PAY MY DEBTS AND LIVE WITH YOU WITHOUT BEING A TOO HEAVY EXPENSE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING
IT WAS STAINED WITH A DROP OF BLOOD
COME NOW DO YOU SERIOUSLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SHE SAID
BEFORE YOU SIT DOWN TELL THEM IN THE KITCHEN NOT TO OPEN TO ANYBODY IF THERE IS A RING THIS ORDER WAS GIVEN AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I DARED NOT SAY ANYTHING TO MY FATHER
WE WENT ALL OVER THE HOUSE AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT
I SHALL SAY NOTHING WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO-NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
BUT OBSERVE THAT WE ARE ONLY AT OUR SECOND DAY AND ALREADY I HAVE HAD TO FORGIVE YOU SOMETHING
GIVE HER FLOWERS SWEETS BOXES AT THE THEATRE
DID YOU EVER KNOW A CERTAIN MARGUERITE GAUTIER THE LADY OF THE CAMELLIAS EXACTLY OH VERY WELL THE WORD WAS SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY A SMILE WHICH COULD LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO ITS MEANING
IF I HAD SEEN MARGUERITE UNHAPPY IF IN REVENGING MYSELF UPON HER I COULD HAVE COME TO HER AID I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE FORGIVEN HER AND CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE NEVER DREAMT OF DOING HER AN INJURY
SHALL I TELL YOU WHY
YOU LOVE ME I AM SURE BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW ON HOW SLIGHT A THREAD DEPENDS THE LOVE ONE HAS FOR A WOMAN LIKE ME
FOR MY PART IT WAS AS IF A CIRCLE OF IRON TIGHTENED ABOUT MY HEAD A VEIL COVERED MY EYES A RUMBLING FILLED MY EARS AND ALL I COULD DO WAS TO UNSTOP A SMELLING BOTTLE WHICH I HAPPENED TO HAVE WITH ME AND TO DRAW IN LONG BREATHS OF IT
NOTHING AFFORDS SO FINE A FRAME FOR THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES AS THE BLUE SKY THE ODOURS THE FLOWERS THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO HIS ARMS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
DO NOT TREAT ME AS IF I WERE AN AUCTIONEER AND LET IT BE THE PLEDGE BETWEEN US OF A LONGER AND MORE INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE GOOD SAID ARMAND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND AND PRESSING MINE
I IMAGINE EVERY MOMENT THAT I AM GOING TO DIE
I REPEAT THEN THAT ON THE PART OF MARGUERITE GAUTIER THE MEANS WHICH SHE USED TO PAY HER DEBTS WITHOUT ASKING YOU FOR THE MONEY NECESSARY FOR IT WAS A SCRUPLE BY WHICH YOU OUGHT TO PROFIT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
I PUT DOWN MY UNLOADED GUN AT MY SIDE AND MEDITATED
NO I WILL FORGET EVERYTHING AND WE WILL BE HAPPY AS WE PROMISED ONE ANOTHER THAT WE WOULD BE MARGUERITE SHOOK HER HEAD DOUBTFULLY AND SAID
NANINE ENTERED CARRYING PLATES A COLD CHICKEN A BOTTLE OF CLARET AND SOME STRAWBERRIES
ALONE NO
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I WENT TO THE RUE D'ANTIN
I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
IT MAY SOUND CHILDISH TO TELL YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT EVERYTHING RELATING TO MARGUERITE IS SO FRESH IN MY MEMORY THAT I CAN NOT HELP RECALLING THEM NOW
BUT YOU WILL STAY WITH ME TILL THEN OF COURSE
BUT NO VANITY THE DESIRE OF HAVING DRESSES AND CARRIAGES AND DIAMONDS CARRIES US AWAY
YOU MUST PERMIT ME MY DEAR MARGUERITE TO SHARE ONLY THE BENEFITS OF THOSE ENTERPRISES WHICH I HAVE CONCEIVED AND CARRIED OUT MYSELF WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT I HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION THAT M
THE OTHER DAY AFTER A SUPPER SHE HAD TO STAY IN BED FOR A WEEK
YES ARMAND WENT ON LETTING HIS HEAD SINK BACK ON THE CHAIR YES IT WAS JUST SUCH AN EVENING AS THIS
MY MOTHER DIED OF CONSUMPTION AND THE WAY I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED COULD BUT INCREASE THE ONLY HERITAGE SHE EVER LEFT ME
HE SEEMED TO SAY NEITHER YES NOR NO
IT WAS CONTEMPT
STILL I WAS NOT SO STRONG AS THAT QUITE AT ONCE
IF YOU HAD NOT SENT ME ANY WORD I HAD TOLD HER TO GIVE YOU THOSE PAPERS WHEN YOU RETURNED TO FRANCE
I THINK IT HIDEOUS
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT WELL WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE SAID HE IS SURE TO COME HERE AND SHE BEGGED ME TO ASK YOU TO FORGIVE HER I HAVE FORGIVEN HER YOU MAY TELL HER
ALL THESE SUPPOSITIONS AS YOU MAY SEE WERE IMPROBABLE ENOUGH
SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO
WILL YOU EVER SEE ME AGAIN
ARMAND PASSED HIS HAND ACROSS HIS EYES AND REPLIED EXACTLY THREE WEEKS YOU HAD A LONG JOURNEY OH I WAS NOT TRAVELLING ALL THE TIME
THE YOUNG MAN WHOM I WAS WITH RECOGNISED HER IMMEDIATELY FOR HE SAID TO ME MENTIONING HER NAME
WHEN SHALL I BE SEEING YOU WHEN YOU PERMIT ME GOOD-BYE THEN IT WAS CRUEL YOU WILL ADMIT
IT IS ALL VERY WELL WHEN I AM ALONE WITH THE COUNT BUT I WON'T INFLICT SUCH A PUNISHMENT ON YOU YOU SHOW ME THAT PREFERENCE SAID M
BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
MY FATHER HAD REALIZED THAT WORDS EVEN FROM HIM WOULD DO NOTHING TO CONSOLE ME AND HE LET ME WEEP WITHOUT SAYING A WORD ONLY SOMETIMES PRESSING MY HAND AS IF TO REMIND ME THAT I HAD A FRIEND AT MY SIDE
THOSE WHO WALK IN THEM WALK WITH BLEEDING FEET AND TORN HANDS BUT THEY ALSO LEAVE THE TRAPPINGS OF VICE UPON THE THORNS OF THE WAYSIDE AND REACH THE JOURNEY'S END IN A NAKEDNESS WHICH IS NOT SHAMEFUL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD
TO-NIGHT AT THE VAUDEVILLE
SHE WAS SO ABSORBED IN HER THOUGHTS THAT I CAME CLOSE TO HER CHAIR WITHOUT HER HEARING ME
PROBABLY SHE HAD FOUND A PURCHASER FOR HER FURNITURE AND SHE HAD GONE TO PARIS TO CONCLUDE THE BARGAIN
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE COLOUR OF THE GLASS THROUGH WHICH ONE SEES IT
AT THE FLORIST'S MADAME BARJON'S SHE HAD COME TO BE CALLED THE LADY OF THE CAMELLIAS AND THE NAME STUCK TO HER
FORTY FIFTY SIXTY A HUNDRED IF I HAD WISHED TO MAKE A SENSATION I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE SUCCEEDED FOR A PROFOUND SILENCE HAD ENSUED AND PEOPLE GAZED AT ME AS IF TO SEE WHAT SORT OF A PERSON IT WAS WHO SEEMED TO BE SO DETERMINED TO POSSESS THE VOLUME
YOU OFTEN CAME TO SEE MME
BUT WE FEAR TO WEARY THE READER
O YOUNG PEOPLE HOW YOU ALWAYS SACRIFICE SINCERE TO DOUBTFUL AFFECTIONS DO NOT SAY THAT FATHER
I CAN NOT SLEEP
ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON ON THE RIGHT ONE LOOKS ACROSS BILL AFTER HILL
HE HAD ALWAYS OBSTINATELY REFUSED TO TELL HIS FAMILY OF THE DANGER WHICH HE HAD BEEN IN AND WHEN HE WAS WELL AGAIN HIS FATHER DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU ONE EVENING SEATED ON THE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WE LOOKED AT THE MOON WHICH SEEMED TO RISE WITH DIFFICULTY OUT OF ITS BED OF CLOUDS AND WE LISTENED TO THE WIND VIOLENTLY RUSTLING THE TREES
HAD I FALLEN INTO SOME TRAP
THINK IT OVER ARMAND AND DO NOT TALK ANY MORE SUCH ABSURDITIES
I OUGHT TO ANSWER HIM GO MY FRIEND SHE SAID
IT IS VERY STUPID
NOW GASTON PLAY THE INVITATION A LA VALSE WHY TO PLEASE ME FIRST OF ALL AND THEN BECAUSE I NEVER CAN MANAGE TO PLAY IT MYSELF WHAT PART DO YOU FIND DIFFICULT THE THIRD PART THE PART IN SHARPS GASTON ROSE AND WENT TO THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO PLAY THE WONDERFUL MELODY OF WEBER THE MUSIC OF WHICH STOOD OPEN BEFORE HIM
EITHER MY LETTER HAD TROUBLED HER TOO MUCH FOR HER TO CARE TO GO TO THE THEATRE OR SHE FEARED TO COME ACROSS ME AND SO WISHED TO AVOID AN EXPLANATION
DE N AFTER GIVING ME ONE OF THOSE LOOKS IN WHICH WOMEN SUM UP THEIR OPINION OF A MAN
YOUR FATHER ENTREATS YOU I ANSWERED NOTHING
AND HERE YOU ARE TAKING LORDLY AIRS AND TALKING BIG WORDS
WHAT NEED HAD I OF THE HORSES
FOR YOU KNOW CONFESSIONS MUST BE MADE WITHOUT WITNESSES I FOLDED THIS KIND OF MADRIGAL IN PROSE AND SENT IT BY JOSEPH WHO HANDED IT TO MARGUERITE HERSELF
I LOOKED ABOUT ME AND WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THE LIFE OF OTHERS CONTINUE WITHOUT PAUSING AT MY DISTRESS
I CAME IN AT FOUR AND HAD QUITE AN APPETITE FOR MY DINNER
I DON'T SAY NO ONE EVER COMES WHEN I AM GONE
I THOUGHT IT WAS I WHO HAD TO FORGIVE HER AND TO-DAY I FEEL UNWORTHY OF THE FORGIVENESS WHICH SHE GRANTS ME
JANUARY 8
WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE HAS BECOME A DIFFERENT WOMAN DO YOU THINK THEN SIR THAT THE MISSION OF A MAN OF HONOUR IS TO GO ABOUT CONVERTING LOST WOMEN
PERHAPS A MESSENGER WOULD ARRIVE WITH THE NEWS OF SOME DREADFUL ACCIDENT
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN THAT ALL THE COMTE DE G
HE HAS GAMBLED I KNOW
GAUTIER TO SACRIFICE ANYTHING FOR YOU
IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT BUT BOUGIVAL IN SPITE OF ITS HORRIBLE NAME IS ONE OF THE PRETTIEST PLACES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE
YOU MUST OPEN THE DOOR
ARMAND STILL SAD BUT A LITTLE RELIEVED BY THE NARRATION OF HIS STORY SOON RECOVERED AND WE WENT TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO PRUDENCE AND TO JULIE DUPRAT
ABOVE ALL WHATEVER I FELT FOR HER I HAD TO SEE HER AGAIN AND AT ONCE
I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING ALL DAY
HIS FIRST GLANCE SEEMED TO STUDY ME ATTENTIVELY
NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE
THEN TOO MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION AND OF LIVING THEM SO SWIFTLY AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM
COME AT ONCE SHE SAID
AS FOR ME ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I REGRETTED HAVING COME
I EXPECTED TO SEE YOU EVERY MOMENT FOR THERE WAS A STALL AT MY SIDE WHICH REMAINED EMPTY THE WHOLE EVENING AND I WAS SURE YOU HAD TAKEN IT BUT WHY SHOULD I GO WHERE MARGUERITE GOES BECAUSE YOU ARE HER LOVER SURELY WHO TOLD YOU THAT PRUDENCE WHOM I MET YESTERDAY
THE WHOLE PLACE FURNISHED IN A WAY TO DIVERT A HYPOCHONDRIAC
THEY SAY HE WAS QUITE WILD ABOUT IT AND SHE THEY ALWAYS SAY SHE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT AS GIRLS LIKE THAT ARE IN LOVE
HOW GOOD HOW RESIGNED SHE WAS
WITHDRAWING AFTER TWO DAYS WAS I NOT LIKE A PARASITE OF LOVE AFRAID OF HAVING TO PAY THE BILL OF THE BANQUET
YOU WILL FIND EVERYTHING EXCEPT A LITTLE CASE WITH YOUR INITIALS
CHAPTER 19 IN HIS FIRST THREE LETTERS MY FATHER INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF MY SILENCE
SHE CARES NOTHING ABOUT YOU
I PREFERRED TO SPEAK TO YOU MYSELF
A MAN WITH SUCH AN INCOME HAS A LARGE HOUSE HORSES SERVANTS CARRIAGES
I HAD NOTHING TO REPLY EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS RIGHT
I WAS ABSOLUTELY RESOLVED TO HAVE SOMETHING WHICH HAD BELONGED TO HER AND I HASTENED TO THE AUCTIONEER AND ASKED HIM TO ALLOW ME TO SEE THE LIST OF THE THINGS SOLD AND OF THE BUYERS NAMES
ONCE ALREADY SHE HAD NOT REPLIED TO THE SAME WORDS AND THE COMTE DE G YOU WILL REMEMBER HAD SPENT THE NIGHT WITH HER
IT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP HER CARRIAGE
IN SHORT IT WAS WARM ENOUGH FOR THE LIVING TO THINK A LITTLE OF THE DEAD AND PAY THEM A VISIT
SHE HAD NOT SLEPT FOR TWO NIGHTS
THAT WE BELONG TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WE ARE YOUNG AND THAT WE LOVE
THEN I DRESSED HER AS SHE HAD ASKED ME TO DO
OLD MEN ARE EGOISTS
SHE PRESERVES NO DIGNITY SHE INSPIRES NO INTEREST
COME AT ONCE MARGUERITE CLOSED HER WINDOW AND PRUDENCE HERS
I STARTED AT ONCE AND YOU KNOW THE REST
I CAN NOT VERY WELL TALK
NO YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT YOU THINK SO NATURALLY
I SAW ONLY THE RESULT I THOUGHT ONLY OF THE HOUR WHEN I WAS TO SEE MARGUERITE AGAIN
SHE DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE BOIS
EITHER YOU WOULD BE AN ORDINARY MAN AND CASTING HER PAST IN HER TEETH YOU WOULD LEAVE HER TELLING HER THAT YOU WERE ONLY DOING LIKE HER OTHER LOVERS AND YOU WOULD ABANDON HER TO CERTAIN MISERY
DO YOU THINK THAT MY REAL HAPPINESS LIES IN THE TRIFLES THAT MEAN SO MUCH WHEN ONE HAS NOTHING TO LOVE BUT WHICH BECOME TRIFLING INDEED WHEN ONE HAS
I TOOK THE LETTER
HE MADE NONE OF THE OBJECTIONS THAT HIS POSITION AS FRIEND AND SOLICITOR AUTHORIZED HIM TO MAKE AND ASSURED ME THAT HE WOULD ARRANGE THE WHOLE AFFAIR IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
AFTER ALL THE PRESENCE OF M
BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO-NIGHT AT EIGHT AT THE APPOINTED HOUR MARGUERITE CAME TO ME AT MME
I AM A POOR COUNTRY GIRL AND SIX YEARS AGO I COULD NOT WRITE MY OWN NAME
O MY GOD MY GOD MURMURED ARMAND AND TURNED PALER THAN BEFORE
AND LOOK TWICE AT THE KEEP OF THEM THEY PRETEND TO CRY OVER AND WRITE ON THEIR TOMBSTONES ALL ABOUT THE TEARS THEY HAVEN'T SHED AND COME AND MAKE DIFFICULTIES ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBOURS
I AM GOING TO SAY A MAD THING TO YOU
I TREMBLED
WHEN THEY WERE ON THE STREET HE HANDED HER INTO A PHAETON WHICH HE DROVE HIMSELF AND THEY WERE WHIRLED AWAY BY TWO SUPERB HORSES
I HAD TO GO MYSELF AND SEE AFTER ALL HER THINGS AND YOURS TOO
FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW COME MARGUERITE I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE A ROUNDABOUT WAY OF SAYING WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY
WHEN I OPENED THE DRAWER IN WHICH THE TRINKETS AND DIAMONDS WERE USUALLY KEPT THESE OPENED WITHOUT RESISTANCE BUT THE JEWEL CASES HAD DISAPPEARED ALONG WITH THEIR CONTENTS NO DOUBT
SHE ASKED ME FOR MONEY
I OPENED IT AND THIS IS WHAT IT CONTAINED
AT THE SOUND OF THE DOOR SHE AWOKE AND ASKED IF HER MISTRESS HAD COME IN
I AM QUITE SIMPLY CONVINCED OF A CERTAIN PRINCIPLE WHICH IS
THAT'S ONE IF YOU LIKE WHO LOVED MARGUERITE AND SHE LOVED HIM TOO NO DOUBT SHE IS SUCH A QUEER GIRL ONE NEVER KNOWS
HE TURNED OVER THE PAGES OF A BIG BOOK IN WHICH THOSE WHO ENTER THIS LAST RESTING-PLACE ARE INSCRIBED AND NUMBERED AND REPLIED THAT ON THE 22ND OF FEBRUARY AT 12 O'CLOCK A WOMAN OF THAT NAME HAD BEEN BURIED
YOU FIND COINCIDENCES IN THE EVENTS WHICH ARE TOLD YOU A REAL AFFINITY WITH CERTAIN EVENTS OF YOUR OWN EXISTENCE
SHE IS CALLING ME I THINK WE LISTENED
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
DUVAL WHO HAD AUTHORIZED HIM TO GIVE ME THIS SUM NOW AND LATER ON WHATEVER I MIGHT NEED
ALL AT ONCE I HEARD
THE DUKE ACCOMPANIED HER TO PARIS WHERE HE CONTINUED TO SEE HER AS HE HAD DONE AT BAGNERES
AND YET THERE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUINED THEMSELVES FOR THAT WOMAN
EVERYTHING THAT A FATHER CAN DO TO MAKE HIS SON OBEY HIM
THEY LOVE WITH THE HEART OR WITH THE SENSES
MARGUERITE WAS WAITING FOR ME AT THE WINDOW
MARGUERITE GAUTIER IS DEAD YES SIR WHEN DID SHE DIE THREE WEEKS AGO I BELIEVE AND WHY ARE THE ROOMS ON VIEW THE CREDITORS BELIEVE THAT IT WILL SEND UP THE PRICES
THIS IS A HAPPY DAY AND IT HAS MADE ME FORGET ALL THE DAYS I HAVE PASSED FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS
FOR THE WOMAN WHOSE EDUCATION HAS NOT TAUGHT HER WHAT IS RIGHT GOD ALMOST ALWAYS OPENS TWO WAYS WHICH LEAD THITHER THE WAYS OF SORROW AND OF LOVE
DUVAL SUCH AS I HAD IMAGINED HIM FROM THE PORTRAIT HIS SON HAD MADE OF HIM TALL DIGNIFIED KINDLY
WELL SHE SAID SEEING PRUDENCE HAVE YOU SEEN THE DUKE YES INDEED AND WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU HE GAVE ME HOW MUCH SIX THOUSAND HAVE YOU GOT IT YES
I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
LOOKS AFTER HER LIKE A CHILD
IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE EVENTS OF A MOMENT WHICH TELL MORE THAN THE COURTSHIP OF A YEAR
FEARING THAT SO MONOTONOUS A LIFE WAS BEGINNING TO WEARY HER I PROPOSED RETURNING TO PARIS
COME I SAID COURAGE GOOD-BYE HE SAID
HE HAS LOOKED AFTER IT WELL CONTINUED ARMAND
I DREAMED INCREDIBLE DREAMS OF THE FUTURE
I GAVE IT TO THEM STRAIGHT I DID
WHAT IS THE MATTER I SAID TO HER IN A LOW VOICE
THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT WE MEAN BY OUR ABSENCE GO IN IF YOU LIKE BUT ALLOW ME TO STAY HERE WHY BECAUSE YOUR MIRTH HURTS ME WELL I WILL BE SAD MARGUERITE LET ME SAY TO YOU SOMETHING WHICH YOU HAVE NO DOUBT OFTEN HEARD SO OFTEN THAT THE HABIT OF HEARING IT HAS MADE YOU BELIEVE IT NO LONGER BUT WHICH IS NONE THE LESS REAL AND WHICH I WILL NEVER REPEAT AND THAT IS SHE SAID WITH THE SMILE OF A YOUNG MOTHER LISTENING TO SOME FOOLISH NOTION OF HER CHILD
I HAD THE BOX WHERE I GAVE YOU OUR FIRST RENDEZVOUS
I WAS CRUELLY HUMILIATED IN THE VANITY OF MY AFFECTION
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE I FEEL THAT YOU LOVE ME FOR MYSELF AND NOT FOR YOURSELF WHILE ALL THE OTHERS HAVE ONLY LOVED ME FOR THEMSELVES
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE
WELL PRUDENCE SHE WENT ON HAVE YOU DONE WHAT I ASKED YOU TO DO YES
SHE HAS CLOSED HER DOORS TO HIM FOR TWO DAYS
I DID NOT GO ANY FARTHER IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
WITHOUT HIS HAVING SAID ANYTHING TO ME EXCEPT TO SPEAK OF MATTERS QUITE APART FROM THE EVENT WHICH HAD OCCASIONED MY LEAVING PARIS
THOUGH WE WERE IN PARIS THE VERDURE WHICH SURROUNDED US SEEMED TO SHUT US OFF FROM THE WORLD AND OUR CONVERSATION WAS ONLY NOW AND AGAIN DISTURBED BY THE SOUND OF A PASSING VEHICLE
IT IS AS IF YOU WERE TO OFFER PERFUMES TO DOGS--THEY WOULD THINK IT SMELLED BAD AND GO AND ROLL IN THE GUTTER AFTER ALL WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME I SAID AFFECTING TO SPEAK IN A NONCHALANT WAY
AS IT WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES IT STOPPED AND A TALL YOUNG MAN LEFT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH WHOM HE WAS TALKING AND CAME UP TO HER
NOT A VEHICLE WAS TO BE SEEN ON THE ROAD
MARGUERITE ROSE AND TALKED WITH HER IN WHISPERS
YOU ARE YOUNG BEAUTIFUL LIFE WILL CONSOLE YOU
IF I HAD BEEN FREE FIRST OF ALL I WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THE COUNT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY OR IF I HAD I SHOULD HAVE COME AND ASKED YOUR FORGIVENESS AS YOU ASK ME NOW AND IN FUTURE I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO OTHER LOVER BUT YOU
WHEN I ENTERED HIS ROOM AT NINE ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY PALE BUT SEEMED CALM
HE WALKED WITH ME AS FAR AS THE STATION
TILL TO-MORROW THEN CHAPTER 22 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THE TRAIN DID NOT MOVE
I WAS NOT LONG IN SEEING THAT THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT WAS THAT WHICH DOMINATED ALL OTHERS IN HIS MIND
A CLOUD PASSED BEFORE MY EYES AND MY BLOOD BEAT IN MY TEMPLES
WILL YOU PERMIT ME TO GET INTO BED SHE SAID WITH A SMILE AS SHE MOVED TOWARD THE BED
YOU WILL MAKE A BOOK OUT OF IT
THE DAWN FOUND US BOTH AWAKE
SHE WAS EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL
HE SCARCELY DARES GLANCE AT THE TRIM ANKLE WHICH SHE SHOWS AS SHE HOLDS HER DRESS OUT OF THE MUD
FROM TIME TO TIME BIG TEARS ROLLED FROM HER EYES AND STAYED UPON HER CHEEKS SHINING LIKE DIAMONDS
PERHAPS YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TOO MUCH I SAID TO HIM
BUT FIRST PUT OUT THE LAMP IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND IF ANY ONE COMES SAY THAT I HAVE NOT COME BACK AND SHALL NOT BE COMING BACK SHE WAS LIKE A WOMAN WHO IS PREOCCUPIED WITH SOMETHING AND PERHAPS ANNOYED BY AN UNWELCOME GUEST
I HEARD THEN THAT YOU WERE GONE ON A LONG VOYAGE
A FEW DAYS LATER THERE WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE AT THE OPERA COMIQUE
SHE DID NOT TELL ME TO COME TO SEE HER DURING THE DAY AND I DARED NOT GO
NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM
DOES IT SEEM STRANGE THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER SHOULD SPEAK TO YOU LIKE THAT
I HOPED TO REACH PARIS IN TIME FOR THE SALE AND I ONLY MANAGED TO GET HERE THIS MORNING
THEY HAD COME TO SEIZE MY THINGS
THEN WHEN SHE SEES THAT IT IS NOT YOU HER FACE RESUMES ITS SORROWFUL EXPRESSION A COLD SWEAT BREAKS OUT OVER IT AND HER CHEEK-BONES FLUSH
WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE ME FOR NOTHING
WEEKS MONTHS YEARS PASS AND ALL AT ONCE WHEN THEY HAVE EACH FOLLOWED THEIR FATE ALONG A DIFFERENT PATH THE LOGIC OF CHANCE BRINGS THEM FACE TO FACE
UNFORTUNATELY THE MYSTERY HAD VANISHED WITH THE GODDESS AND FOR ALL THEIR ENDEAVOURS THEY DISCOVERED ONLY WHAT WAS ON SALE SINCE THE OWNER'S DECEASE AND NOTHING OF WHAT HAD BEEN ON SALE DURING HER LIFETIME
ON LEAVING HE SENT US MORE MONEY
THAT WAS THE DREAM THAT THE HOT SUN BROUGHT TO ME THAT DAY THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE TREES AS LYING ON THE GRASS OF THE ISLAND ON WHICH WE HAD LANDED I LET MY THOUGHT WANDER FREE FROM THE HUMAN LINKS THAT HAD BOUND IT GATHERING TO ITSELF EVERY HOPE THAT CAME IN ITS WAY
I WENT TO THE SOLICITOR'S
LET HER FIND THE MEANS TO GET OUT OF THIS DIFFICULTY
I WENT OUT FOR DINNER AND CAME BACK ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
I DROPPED MY EYES AND BLUSHED
I ACCEPTED IT FOR COMING FROM YOUR FATHER IT COULD NOT BE EXACTLY TAKING ALMS
THE MEETING WAS SO SUDDEN THAT I TURNED PALE
FIVE O'CLOCK STRUCK AT THE CHURCH OF SAINT ROCH AT THE MOMENT WHEN I ENTERED MARGUERITE'S HOUSE
IF MY SON WERE HERE I WOULD SEND HIM
I COULD NOT LEAVE THE STREET AND I NEVER TOOK MY EYES OFF MARGUERITE'S HOUSE
LOVE AFFAIRS HABITS WORK TOOK THE PLACE OF OTHER THOUGHTS AND WHEN I RECALLED THIS ADVENTURE I LOOKED UPON IT AS ONE OF THOSE PASSIONS WHICH ONE HAS WHEN ONE IS VERY YOUNG AND LAUGHS AT SOON AFTERWARD
I WENT UP TO HIM ALL THE SAME AS IF I HAD SEEN NOTHING IN HIS FACE EMBRACED HIM AND SAID
GO I SAID ASKING MYSELF WHO IT COULD BE AT SUCH AN HOUR AND NOT DARING TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS MARGUERITE
ONLY TO KISS HER HAND HE FELT THAT HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO UNDERTAKE ANYTHING THE WILL TO CONQUER ANYTHING THE COURAGE TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING
I TRIED TO ASSUME AN INDIFFERENT AIR AS I ASKED HER WHAT HAD BROUGHT HER
THE DOCTOR HAD ALLOWED HIM TO GET UP AND WE OFTEN SAT TALKING AT THE OPEN WINDOW AT THE HOUR WHEN THE SUN IS AT ITS HEIGHT FROM TWELVE TO TWO
WHEN ONE'S EXISTENCE HAS CONTRACTED A HABIT SUCH AS THAT OF THIS LOVE IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE HABIT SHOULD BE BROKEN WITHOUT AT THE SAME TIME BREAKING ALL THE OTHER SPRINGS OF LIFE
I MUST SEE YOU I WAITED TILL THE HOUR HE HAD NAMED BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR
YOU SIMPLY WORRY ME AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE
IT WAS A GREAT GRIEF TO THE DUKE WHEN HIS FRIENDS ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR SOME SCANDAL ON THE PART OF THE WOMAN WITH WHOM IT SEEMED TO THEM HE WAS COMPROMISING HIMSELF CAME TO TELL HIM INDEED TO PROVE TO HIM THAT AT TIMES WHEN SHE WAS SURE OF NOT SEEING HIM SHE RECEIVED OTHER VISITS AND THAT THESE VISITS WERE OFTEN PROLONGED TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY
IT IS NOTHING THE FATIGUE OF A RAPID JOURNEY
SHE TOLD US THAT MARGUERITE WAS THE CAUSE OF IT
I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO ASK ME WHAT I THOUGHT
NEXT DAY A MIDWIFE OF WHOM ALL WE WILL SAY IS THAT SHE WAS A FRIEND OF THE MOTHER VISITED LOUISE WHO REMAINED IN BED FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN GOT UP PALER AND FEEBLER THAN BEFORE
SHE WAS IN A GROUND-FLOOR BOX QUITE ALONE
MADAME CAN NOT RECEIVE YOU SHE SAID IN AN EMBARRASSED WAY
HER NATURE WAS MORBIDLY OPEN TO ALL IMPRESSIONS AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL SENTIMENTS
OLYMPE RETURNED IN A FURY AND MARGUERITE FAINTED AND HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT
THAT BESIDES LOVE THERE ARE DUTIES
I HAD NOTICED THAT EVER SINCE HIS LAST VISIT TO THE CEMETERY AND THE SIGHT WHICH HAD BROUGHT ON SO VIOLENT A CRISIS SORROW SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN OVERCOME BY SICKNESS AND MARGUERITE'S DEATH NO LONGER APPEARED TO HIM UNDER ITS FORMER ASPECT
BUT SCARCELY WAS HE SEATED BEFORE HE BURST INTO TEARS AND HID HIS FACE IN HIS POCKET-HANDKERCHIEF
SHALL I WAIT FOR AN ANSWER ASKED JOSEPH MY SERVANT LIKE ALL SERVANTS WAS CALLED JOSEPH IF THEY ASK WHETHER THERE IS A REPLY YOU WILL SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND WAIT I BUOYED MYSELF UP WITH THE HOPE THAT SHE WOULD REPLY
AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS THE COUNT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP AND ONLY THE DUKE OBLIGED ME TO CONCEAL MY LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND EVEN HE WAS SENT AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED
I RECOGNISED THE HAND OF GASTON
I MUST LEAVE THIS WOMAN WITHOUT GIVING HER THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MADE ME SUFFER AND THIS IS WHAT I WROTE TO HER IN MY MOST ELEGANT HANDWRITING AND WITH TEARS OF RAGE AND SORROW IN MY EYES
MANON DIED IN THE DESERT IT IS TRUE BUT IN THE ARMS OF THE MAN WHO LOVED HER WITH THE WHOLE ENERGY OF HIS SOUL
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE WHICH GAVE ME AN EASY MEANS OF SATISFYING THE THOUSAND CAPRICES OF MARGUERITE
JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
IF SHE LIKES TO LIVE QUIETLY HE WILL STAY WITH HER A LONG TIME AND WHAT IS SHE DOING
NOW AND AGAIN HER BOSOM WAS RAISED BY A LONG SIGH WHICH SEEMED TO RELIEVE HER A LITTLE AND FOR A FEW SECONDS SHE WOULD SEEM TO BE QUITE COMFORTABLE
REACHING PARIS I HASTENED OFF TO SEE PRUDENCE INTENDING TO ASK HER TO GO AND KEEP MARGUERITE COMPANY IN THE HOPE THAT HER MIRTH AND LIVELINESS WOULD DISTRACT HER
SILENT TEARS FLOWED FROM HER EYES AND SHE WAS DEAD
BUT YOU KNOW WELL ONE IS ALWAYS SLOW IN TAKING A DECIDED STEP
SO MARGUERITE WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS
ONE O'CLOCK STRUCK
IF I WERE ONLY GOING TO GET WELL
IF MARGUERITE HAS NOT BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO YOU TWENTY TIMES IT IS BECAUSE SHE HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATURE
AGAIN MY FATHER WAS ABSENT BUT HE HAD LEFT THIS LETTER FOR ME
SHE HAD ONCE BEEN A KEPT WOMAN AND HAD TRIED TO GO ON THE STAGE HAD FAILED AND RELYING ON HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH FASHIONABLE PEOPLE IN PARIS HAD GONE INTO BUSINESS AND TAKEN A MILLINER'S SHOP
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT THE WINDOW I SENT ON JOSEPH TO TELL MY FATHER THAT I WAS ON MY WAY
I BEGAN TO THINK OVER THIS POOR GIRL'S LIFE AND MY LOVE FOR HER WAS MINGLED WITH A GREAT PITY
WHAT WILL YOU TAKE
ARNOULD ISN'T SHE IF THERE WERE ANY SUITABLE ROOMS AND SHE SHOWED ME JUST THE VERY THING
COME CONTINUED MARGUERITE WE ARE TALKING MERE CHILDISHNESS
I LEFT MY BED TO COME TO YOU AND ASK NOT FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP BUT FOR YOUR INDIFFERENCE I TOOK MARGUERITE'S HAND
THEN HE SAID TO ME
WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME
WELL WHAT SORT OF A GIRL WAS SHE A GOOD SORT OF GIRL IS THAT ALL OH YES
I TOOK UP MY POSITION AT THE MAISON-D'OR IN ONE OF THE FIRST-FLOOR ROOMS AND DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE WINDOW FOR AN INSTANT
I DON'T THINK LIFE EVER SEEMED TO ME SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO FULL OF POSSIBILITIES
I MUST CONVINCE MYSELF OF IT
BUT I HAVE ENOUGH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL SPLENDIDLY FOR FIVE OR SIX MONTHS IF THAT WILL AMUSE YOU THE LEAST IN THE WORLD AFTER ALL NO SHE SAID LEAVING THE WINDOW AND GOING TO SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
YOUR FATHER TOO WILL HAVE THOUGHT IT OVER ON HIS SIDE AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BOTH COME TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
PRUDENCE DUVERNOY THAT WAS THE MILLINER'S AUSPICIOUS NAME WAS ONE OF THOSE FAT WOMEN OF FORTY WITH WHOM ONE REQUIRES VERY LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW ESPECIALLY WHEN WHAT ONE WANTS TO KNOW IS AS SIMPLE AS WHAT I HAD TO ASK OF HER
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO
SINCE M
SHE WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOVER
MY ROOM SEEMED TOO SMALL TO CONTAIN MY HAPPINESS
I NEVER SAW HER PAY THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS BEING ACTED
ELBOWED MLLE
THAT I WAS AFTER ALL ONLY A KEPT WOMAN AND THAT WHATEVER EXCUSE I GAVE FOR OUR LIAISON IT WOULD ALWAYS LOOK LIKE CALCULATION ON MY PART
BUT HE IS GOOD AND JUST HE WILL CHANGE HIS FIRST IMPRESSION
HIS TEETH CHATTERED
IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST SMILE OF SPRING
I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN I HELD HER IN MY ARMS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN WENT
FOR A MOMENT I TRIED TO FORGET MYSELF TO FORCE MY HEART AND MY THOUGHTS TO BECOME INDIFFERENT TO THE SIGHT BEFORE ME AND TO TAKE MY SHARE OF THAT GAIETY WHICH SEEMED LIKE ONE OF THE COURSES OF THE MEAL
NOT ONE LIFTED HIS EYES TO MY WINDOW
I REALIZED THE PAIN I MUST HAVE GIVEN HER BY WHAT I NOW EXPERIENCED AND FOR FIVE MINUTES I LOVED HER AS NO WOMAN WAS EVER LOVED
YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF PERHAPS IF YOU LEAVE ME AND DO NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR FATHER ON MY ACCOUNT
I REMEMBERED AT THE SAME TIME HOW EMBARRASSED PRUDENCE HAD APPEARED WHEN I LOOKED AT HER AFTER THIS REMARK WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE AN APPOINTMENT
WELL WHEN THE RELATIVES OF THE FOLK THAT ARE BURIED BESIDE HER FOUND OUT THE SORT OF PERSON SHE WAS WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY SAID
LE COMTE TO THE DOOR WE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN AND SHUT
WE DID NOT EVEN LET THE SUNLIGHT ENTER OUR ROOM
IT WAS TO HIM THAT SHE HAD CLOSED HER DOORS THE NIGHT BEFORE
AS FOR US FROM THE MOMENT WE CAN NO LONGER SERVE THE VANITY OR THE PLEASURE OF OUR LOVERS THEY LEAVE US AND LONG NIGHTS FOLLOW LONG DAYS
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU I SHOULD HAVE GONE AWAY TO-MORROW HOW CAN MY VISIT CHANGE YOUR PLANS
YOU MUST CALL ON YOUR FATHER AGAIN AND YOU MUST CALL TO-MORROW WHY TO-MORROW RATHER THAN ANY OTHER DAY BECAUSE SAID MARGUERITE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT SHE BLUSHED SLIGHTLY AT THIS QUESTION BECAUSE IT WILL SHOW THAT YOU ARE THE MORE KEEN ABOUT IT AND HE WILL FORGIVE US THE SOONER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY MARGUERITE WAS SAD AND PREOCCUPIED
PRUDENCE TO WHOM I CAN NO LONGER GIVE AS MUCH AS I USED TO BEGINS TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR NOT COMING
YOU MUST COME MY FRIEND
AT SIX IN THE MORNING I LEFT HER AND BEFORE LEAVING HER I SAID
I WENT TO THE CEMETERY SAYING TO MYSELF
WHILE NOW YOU HAVE EIGHT OR TEN THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR ON WHICH WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE
I GAVE MYSELF TO YOU SOONER THAN I EVER DID TO ANY MAN I SWEAR TO YOU
BUT SHE CAN NOT ASK HIM FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
TRACE A DELICATE STRAIGHT NOSE THE NOSTRILS A LITTLE OPEN IN AN ARDENT ASPIRATION TOWARD THE LIFE OF THE SENSES
I WON'T SAY WHAT IMPRESSION HIS SEVERE FACE MADE UPON ME
JULIE WATCHES BY ME AS MUCH AS SHE CAN
WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER
TO THE VAUDEVILLE THE VARIETES THE OPERA COMIQUE
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY
GAUTIER WAS AT HOME
SIR HE SAID WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF THE LUGGAGE IS PACKED ALL OF IT YES SIR WELL THEN UNPACK IT AGAIN
IF IT IS NOT RIGHT TO LOVE THEM IS IT NOT WELL TO PITY THEM
AND INSTEAD OF BELIEVING HER LETTER INSTEAD OF GOING TO ANY STREET IN PARIS EXCEPT THE RUE D'ANTIN INSTEAD OF SPENDING THE EVENING WITH MY FRIENDS AND PRESENTING MYSELF NEXT DAY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR I WAS ACTING THE OTHELLO SPYING UPON HER AND THINKING TO PUNISH HER BY SEEING HER NO MORE
I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD REMAINED BEHIND AND AS I DID NOT KNOW ANY OF THEM NO ONE NOTICED IT
I AM PARTICULARLY AFRAID OF YOUR RETURN TO PARIS WHY FOR MANY REASONS AND SHE WENT ON ABRUPTLY WITHOUT GIVING ME HER REASONS FOR FEARS
BUT WHERE IS THE NECESSITY OF SELLING THINGS WHICH YOU WILL BE GLAD OF WHEN WE RETURN
THE IDEA THAT MARGUERITE WAS PERHAPS UNFAITHFUL TO ME AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I WAITED FOR HER IN TERROR AT HER ABSENCE DID NOT RETURN TO MY MIND
MARGUERITE ASKED ME ALL ABOUT YOU
SHALL WE GO AWAY AND LEAVE PARIS NO NO SHE SAID ALMOST WITH AFFRIGHT
NOW I AM SERIOUSLY ILL
CHAPTER 14 WHEN I REACHED HOME I BEGAN TO CRY LIKE A CHILD
THAT IS TO SAY THAT AT PARIS AT EVERY STEP I MIGHT ELBOW THE MAN WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN HER LOVER OR WHO WAS ABOUT TO WHILE IN THE COUNTRY SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHOM WE HAD NEVER SEEN AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING-TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
YOU SEE SIR WE ARE OBLIGED TO LOVE THE DEAD FOR WE ARE KEPT SO BUSY WE HAVE HARDLY TIME TO LOVE ANYTHING ELSE I LOOKED AT THE MAN AND SOME OF MY READERS WILL UNDERSTAND WITHOUT MY NEEDING TO EXPLAIN IT TO THEM THE EMOTION WHICH I FELT ON HEARING HIM
TO ANSWER THEM PROPERLY ONE REQUIRES A CERTAIN KNACK AND I HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF ACQUIRING IT
I WANTED ESPECIALLY TO BE WITH HER AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
ONE DAY AS I WAS GOING TO THE PREFECTURE FOR A PASSPORT I SAW IN ONE OF THE NEIGHBOURING STREETS A POOR GIRL WHO WAS BEING MARCHED ALONG BY TWO POLICEMEN
VEIL THESE EYES WITH LOVELY LASHES WHICH WHEN DROOPED CAST THEIR SHADOW ON THE ROSY HUE OF THE CHEEKS
A PRETEXT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND
POOR LADY SHE'S DEAD NOW
MANON LESCAUT WAS OPEN ON THE TABLE
BE REASONABLE
AND YET I WAS CERTAIN THAT LETTER WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED TO ME THE CAUSE OF HER SADNESS
ARMAND DID NOT MOVE
I WILL NOT REMIND YOU ARMAND OF THE RETURN YOU MADE FOR THE LAST PROOF OF LOVE THAT I GAVE YOU AND OF THE OUTRAGE BY WHICH YOU DROVE AWAY A DYING WOMAN WHO COULD NOT RESIST YOUR VOICE WHEN YOU ASKED HER FOR A NIGHT OF LOVE AND WHO LIKE A FOOL THOUGHT FOR ONE INSTANT THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN UNITE THE PAST WITH THE PRESENT
I SHALL STILL BE PRETTY FOR A WHILE
NOW I SEEMED TO MYSELF NOT HANDSOME OR RICH OR ELEGANT ENOUGH TO POSSESS SUCH A WOMAN NOW I WAS FILLED WITH VANITY AT THE THOUGHT OF IT
BUT SEEING THAT I DO NOT WRITE SHE WILL WRITE TO ME TO-MORROW
AT THE DOOR PRUDENCE ASKED US TO COME UP AND SEE HER SHOWROOMS WHICH WE HAD NEVER SEEN AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED VERY PROUD
AS I KNEW THAT I SHOULD BE OBLIGED SOONER OR LATER TO SAY IN WHOSE FAVOUR I MADE THIS TRANSFER I THOUGHT IT BEST TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH AT ONCE
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE WOMAN WAS LAUGHING AT ME
YOU ARE RIGHT MY FRIEND BUT I HAD BETTER HOPES AND MARGUERITE MADE A MOTION TO RISE
MARGUERITE OPENED THE DRAWER OF A SIDE-TABLE AND THREW THE BANK-NOTES INTO IT
DUVAL DID NOT RETURN AND I WENT BACK TO BOUGIVAL
DO I NOT ALWAYS I AM SO GLAD
NEVERTHELESS THE CARRIAGE DID NOT RETURN THE SHAWL HAD NOT BEEN SENT BACK AND I BEGAN TO BE ANXIOUS IN SPITE OF MYSELF AND AS I KNEW IN WHICH DRAWER MARGUERITE PUT PRUDENCE'S LETTERS I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WENT TO THE DRAWER AND TRIED TO OPEN IT
GO GO HE SAID AND GOOD LUCK OR RATHER BETTER LUCK I WENT OUT
AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME
IF MY SOCIETY AND THAT OF MY FRIENDS CAN GIVE YOU ANY DISTRACTION IF IN SHORT YOU HAVE NEED OF ME NO MATTER IN WHAT WAY I HOPE YOU WILL REALIZE HOW MUCH PLEASURE IT WILL GIVE ME TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU PARDON PARDON SAID HE
THOSE WHO MEET THESE BOLD TRAVELLERS OUGHT TO SUCCOUR THEM AND TO TELL ALL THAT THEY HAVE MET THEM FOR IN SO DOING THEY POINT OUT THE WAY
NOT BEING OLD ENOUGH TO INVENT I CONTENT MYSELF WITH NARRATING AND I BEG THE READER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF THE TRUTH OF A STORY IN WHICH ALL THE CHARACTERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HEROINE ARE STILL ALIVE
DUVERNOY BEING NEEDFUL ON ACCOUNT OF THE OLD DUKE PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY
NOW IS IT AGREED I AGREE TO ALL YOU WISH AS YOU KNOW THEN IN LESS THAN A MONTH'S TIME WE SHALL BE IN SOME VILLAGE WALKING BY THE RIVER SIDE AND DRINKING MILK
ARE YOU SATISFIED NEED YOU ASK ME NOT A WORD OF THIS EITHER TO YOUR FRIEND OR TO PRUDENCE OR TO ANYBODY WHATEVER I PROMISE NOW KISS ME AND WE WILL GO BACK TO THE DINING-ROOM SHE HELD UP HER LIPS TO ME SMOOTHED HER HAIR AGAIN AND WE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM SHE SINGING AND I ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF
WHAT DO YOU WANT I WANT YOU TO COME OVER AT ONCE WHY BECAUSE THE COMTE DE N
IT IS STILL EARLY WHAT TIME ARE YOU GOING TO PARIS AT FOUR SO SOON
I TOOK A CAB AND FOLLOWED THEM
DUVERNOY TO ASK YOU FOR PITY I WAS UTTERLY WORN OUT BODY AND SOUL
I ENTERED
I ENTERED
I ENTERED
DUVAL THIS LETTER IS FOR ME I SAID TO THE PORTER AS I SHOWED HIM THE ADDRESS
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO
THE FATHER'S SENTIMENT FOR MARGUERITE HAD IN TRUTH SO PURE A CAUSE THAT ANYTHING BUT A COMMUNION OF HEARTS WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO HIM A KIND OF INCEST AND HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HER A WORD WHICH HIS DAUGHTER MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD
IT HAD PRODUCED 3.50,000 FRANCS
OTHERWISE THEY WOULD PUT ASIDE MONEY AND AT THIRTY THEY COULD AFFORD THE LUXURY OF HAVING A LOVER FOR NOTHING
NOTHING IN SHORT WHICH CAN DISTRACT IT FROM THE ONE THOUGHT IN WHICH IT IS CEASELESSLY ABSORBED
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME FOR MY BAD TEMPER TONIGHT SHE SAID TAKING MY HAND
THEY HAVE SOLD THE LOVE THAT THEY INSPIRE
AM I NOT YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG
M
M
M
M
M
M
M
I SAW HER ALONE WITH THE COUNT SAYING OVER TO HIM THE SAME WORDS THAT SHE HAD SAID TO ME IN THE NIGHT AND TAKING A FIVE-HUNDRED-FRANC NOTE I SENT IT TO HER WITH THESE WORDS
BUT IF SHE COMES IN TELL HER THAT I WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT I HAD TO GO TO PARIS AT THIS HOUR YES
LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES
THEN MARGUERITE FELL INTO A KIND OF STUPOR
YOU ARE A VERY NICE FELLOW
YET AFTER ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS WE HAD JUST MADE AFTER THE SACRIFICES THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED AND ACCEPTED WAS IT LIKELY THAT SHE WAS DECEIVING ME
MEANWHILE I WENT TO THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
COME AND STAY FOR A MONTH OR TWO WITH YOUR SISTER AND ME
AT THE FIRST WORD I RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF THE YOUNG COMTE DE N
IT WAS ALL QUITE NATURAL AND IF I WAS TO HAVE A MISTRESS LIKE MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE TO GET USED TO HER WAYS
AND THE AUTHOR'S AGE WILL DO SOMETHING NO DOUBT TO INCREASE THIS FEAR
POOR FEEBLE CREATURES THAT WE ARE
I MUST AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE
OFTEN WHEN MY CRUELTY TOWARD HER BECAME INFAMOUS MARGUERITE LIFTED UPON ME SUCH APPEALING EYES THAT I BLUSHED FOR THE PART I WAS PLAYING AND WAS READY TO IMPLORE HER FORGIVENESS
BIG TEARS TRICKLE DOWN HER CHEEKS SO THIN AND PALE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER RECOGNISE THE FACE OF HER WHOM YOU LOVED SO MUCH IF YOU COULD SEE HER
IF I AM NOT IN BY FOUR COME AND DINE WITH ME TO-MORROW
BY THE END OF THE SUMMER THE WATERS SLEEP THE NATURAL FATIGUE OF LONG WALKS HAD INDEED MORE OR LESS RESTORED HER HEALTH
HE CAME THIS MORNING--SHE COULD NOT BUT ACCEPT THE BOX AND LET HIM ACCOMPANY HER
IF YOU LOVE ME I ASK NOTHING MORE AND YOU WILL LOVE ME JUST AS MUCH WITHOUT HORSES OR SHAWLS OR DIAMONDS ALL THAT WAS SAID SO NATURALLY THAT THE TEARS CAME TO MY EYES AS I LISTENED
WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK
HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT BROKEN AS I NOW WAS I SHOULD SOME DAY EXPERIENCE A TERRIBLE REACTION WHICH MIGHT BE DANGEROUS AND WITHOUT SEEMING TO MAKE ANY EFFORT TO CONSOLE ME HE DID HIS UTMOST TO DISTRACT MY THOUGHTS
THIRTY-FIVE I CRIED IN THE SAME TONE
I THOUGHT THAT YOU MUST HAVE HAD A VERY STRONG MOTIVE FOR GOING TO PARIS AFTER NOT LEAVING ME FOR FOUR MONTHS
AT LAST A FORTNIGHT PASSED WITHOUT MY MEETING HER
DOUBTLESS FOR THE SOMETHING WRITTEN
THERE COULD NOT THEN HAVE BEEN ON HER PART ANYTHING BUT THE HOPE OF FINDING IN ME A SINCERE AFFECTION ABLE TO GIVE HER REST FROM THE MERCENARY LOVES IN WHOSE MIDST SHE LIVED
SINCE YOU HAVE BROKEN WITH HER WHY SHOULD YOU SEE HER AGAIN YOU KNOW IT IS BROKEN OFF SHE SHOWED ME YOUR LETTER WHAT DID SHE SAY ABOUT IT SHE SAID
THAT IS THE WHOLE TRUTH FRIEND
BUT SHE WENT OFF WITH THE DUKE
AND WHEN I THINK THAT THAT IDIOT OF A COUNT PLAYS IT WITHOUT HIS MUSIC AND BEAUTIFULLY I REALLY BELIEVE IT IS THAT THAT MAKES ME SO FURIOUS WITH HIM AND SHE BEGAN AGAIN ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT
YES WHY AT THAT MOMENT HE SAW THAT THE BOX WAS EMPTY
OLYMPE HERSELF WAS LIGHTING THE WAY AND I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW THE OTHERS WHEN TURNING BACK I SAID TO HER
IT IS SIMPLY A KEPT WOMAN VERY MUCH KEPT MY DEAR FELLOW
I THEREFORE SAID TO MY FRIEND THAT I INSISTED ON HAVING HER PERMISSION TO BE INTRODUCED TO HER AND I WANDERED TO AND FRO IN THE CORRIDORS SAYING TO MYSELF THAT IN A MOMENT'S TIME SHE WAS GOING TO SEE ME AND THAT I SHOULD NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK
MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE
FOR THREE WEEKS I HAVE READ THEM TEN TIMES OVER EVERY DAY
NANINE ALONE HAD THE RIGHT TO OPEN OUR DOOR BUT ONLY TO BRING IN OUR MEALS AND EVEN THESE WE TOOK WITHOUT GETTING UP INTERRUPTING THEM WITH LAUGHTER AND GAIETY
WHAT A SAD DAY WE HAVE HAD TO-DAY POOR M
HOW CAN I PLAY EIGHT SHARPS ONE AFTER ANOTHER SHE FOLDED HER ARMS AND LOOKED AT US STAMPING HER FOOT
BUT HE IS AN OLD MAN AND I AM SURE THAT MARGUERITE IS NOT HIS MISTRESS
WHEN WE GOT BACK IT WAS FIVE O'CLOCK
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S
AND YET YOU WERE ALREADY IN LOVE WITH ME YES AND THAT DIDN'T HINDER YOU FROM GOING TO BED AND SLEEPING QUITE COMFORTABLY
WHEN THE HOUR CAME FOR ME TO GO I EMBRACED HER AND ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD COME WITH ME AS FAR AS THE TRAIN
THEY HAVE LIED SO OFTEN THAT NO ONE WILL BELIEVE THEM AND IN THE MIDST OF THEIR REMORSE THEY ARE DEVOURED BY THEIR LOVE
ALL THE CURTAINS WERE HERMETICALLY CLOSED
THAT WOMAN SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS
AN OPEN CARRIAGE WAS STATIONED THERE AND A WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE GOT DOWN FROM IT
WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME AS SHE FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF MY GAZE AND PERHAPS OF MY THOUGHT
FEBRUARY 18
BUT BE BACK EARLY I WENT STRAIGHT TO PRUDENCE
YOU SHALL READ THEM TOO BUT LATER ON WHEN I AM CALMER AND CAN MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND ALL THE LOVE AND TENDERNESS HIDDEN AWAY IN THIS CONFESSION
HE MADE NO REPROACHES HE HAD INDEED NO RIGHT TO DO SO BUT HE ASKED HER IF SHE FELT HERSELF CAPABLE OF CHANGING HER MODE OF LIFE OFFERING HER IN RETURN FOR THE SACRIFICE EVERY COMPENSATION THAT SHE COULD DESIRE
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE PAUSE TO DRAW IN A LONG BREATH FOR I TOO FELT AS IF I HAD A WEIGHT ON MY CHEST
WHILE HE IS DREAMING OF ALL THAT HE WOULD DO TO POSSESS THIS WOMAN SHE STOPS AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND ASKS IF HE WILL COME HOME WITH HER
THAT MAN GETS FRIGHTFULLY ON MY NERVES MY DEAR CHILD SAID PRUDENCE YOU REALLY TREAT HIM TOO BADLY AND HE IS SO GOOD AND KIND TO YOU
I SPOKE TO HIM
I AM IN A FEVER
JANUARY 28
I MIGHT HAVE ASKED IF MARGUERITE WAS AT HOME BUT HE MIGHT HAVE SAID NO AND I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN DOUBT TWO MINUTES LONGER FOR AS LONG AS I DOUBTED THERE WAS STILL HOPE
HE MIGHT PROVOKE HIM FIGHT BE KILLED
WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE BUT THAT HE HAS LEARNED THAT YOU ARE PUBLICLY LIVING WITH M
HER DEATH MADE ON ME THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DEATH OF A PRETTY WOMAN MUST ALWAYS MAKE ON A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD LIKED SEEING HER
NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY PUNCH MADE SAID NANINE
ONE EVENING OLYMPE HAD GONE SOMEWHERE OR OTHER AND HAD MET MARGUERITE WHO FOR ONCE HAD NOT SPARED THE FOOLISH CREATURE SO THAT SHE HAD HAD TO RETIRE IN CONFUSION
BELIEVE ME MY DEAR ARMAND I KNOW WOMEN BETTER THAN YOU DO
YOUR QUESTION BECOMES UNNECESSARY AND MY ANSWER USELESS YOU ARE RIGHT I SAID LETTING MY HEAD SINK ON HER KNEES
ONE BELIEVES WHAT ONE HEARS FOR HERE AS ELSEWHERE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BELIEF AND ONE USES UP ONE'S HEART ONE'S BODY ONE'S BEAUTY LITTLE BY LITTLE
YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANY HARM YET BUT YOU WILL DO IT FATHER SIR I KNOW MORE OF LIFE THAN YOU DO
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE WHOLE SHOP AND I WAS LOOKING ABOUT TO SEE WHAT SWEETS TO CHOOSE WHEN MY FRIEND ASKED FOR A POUND OF RAISINS GLACES
MARGUERITE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED AND THE CARRIAGE CONTINUED ITS COURSE
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS EVER PITIED ME
PACK UP YOUR THINGS AND GET READY TO COME WITH ME PARDON ME FATHER I SAID BUT I SHALL NOT COME AND WHY BECAUSE I AM AT AN AGE WHEN NO ONE ANY LONGER OBEYS A COMMAND MY FATHER TURNED PALE AT MY ANSWER
I HADN'T A NOTION OF IT BUT I DID NOTICE SHE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING SO GAY LATELY HUSH SAID PRUDENCE LISTENING
TO-DAY I CAN NOT SPEAK I CAN SCARCELY MOVE MY ARM
THAT'S IT SAID MARGUERITE JUMPING LIKE A CHILD WE'LL HAVE SUPPER
I WISHED TO BUY SOMETHING AT HER SALE AND I BID HIGHER AND HIGHER FOR THIS BOOK OUT OF MERE OBSTINACY AND TO ANNOY SOME ONE ELSE WHO WAS EQUALLY KEEN TO OBTAIN IT AND WHO SEEMED TO DEFY ME TO THE CONTEST
YOU WILL LAUGH AT THIS LOVE OF YOURS IF YOU CAN STILL LAUGH AND IF IT HAS NOT LEFT TOO SERIOUS A TRACE IN YOUR PAST
WHEN I RE-ENTERED THE ROOM ARMAND WAS DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT
MY DEAR SAID MARGUERITE SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO WHEN I PUT ON ONE SIDE WHAT HE GIVES ME AND ON THE OTHER WHAT HE SAYS TO ME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE BUYS HIS VISITS VERY CHEAP THE POOR FELLOW IS IN LOVE WITH YOU IF I HAD TO LISTEN TO EVERYBODY WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH ME I SHOULDN'T HAVE TIME FOR MY DINNER AND SHE BEGAN TO RUN HER FINGERS OVER THE PIANO AND THEN TURNING TO US SHE SAID
I SAY MY DEAR CHILD THAT EVERY YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE HIS MISTRESS AND THAT FROM THE FRESH INFORMATION I HAVE HAD I WOULD RATHER SEE YOU THE LOVER OF MLLE
FORGIVE ME WELL AND GOOD
ALL THAT SHE HAD SAID BUZZED IN MY HEAD AND I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT SHE WAS RIGHT
PERHAPS I GUESSED AT SOME PATHETIC LOVE STORY UNDER ALL THIS SORROW
IF I DECIDE NOW ON TAKING A NEW LOVER HE MUST HAVE THREE VERY RARE QUALITIES
DUVERNOY TO FORWARD TO M
IT HAD NOW BECOME A STRUGGLE
BUT I QUITTED HER WITHOUT A RECOLLECTION OF THE CARESSES AND OF THE WORDS OF LOVE WHICH SHE HAD FELT BOUND TO SHOWER UPON ME IN RETURN FOR THE SIX THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH I LEFT WITH HER
THERE WAS A KIND OF CANDOUR IN THIS WOMAN
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN
MY FATHER IS THE MOST HONOURABLE MAN IN THE WORLD
AMONG THE INVALIDS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THIS DUKE
ONE DAY MARGUERITE WAS IN HER ROOM
THE MOST FRIGHTFUL PART OF THE SITUATION WAS THAT MY JUDGMENT WAS AGAINST ME
I KNOW I KNOW.--IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT GRAVE HE ADDED TURNING TO ME
THE BRAIN IS NARROW AND IT HARBOURS THOUGHT
I WAS NEAR EMBRACING HIM
HOPE
BESIDES THE IDEA THAT I HAD FORMED OF MARGUERITE ACCENTUATED THE EFFECTS OF HER MOCKERY
SORROW SHARPENS THE SENSATIONS
THIS LOVE FAR FROM LEADING ME ASTRAY IS CAPABLE ON THE CONTRARY OF SETTING ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
I KISSED HER HANDS ARDENTLY AND SAID
OH HOW PROPER YOU ARE SHE SAID SMILING AND GIVING ME HER HAND
PRUDENCE HAD BECOME BANKRUPT
ONE IS FEARED LIKE A BEAST OF PREY SCORNED LIKE A PARIAH SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS TAKE MORE THAN THEY GIVE
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY
I WENT TO VERY'S IN THE PALAIS ROYAL
YOU WERE PLAYING THE PIANO WHEN WE CAME IN I SAID IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION
I WENT OUT UNDER THE PRETEXT OF GOING TO LUNCH
AND THE OTHER M
PRUDENCE IS PAWNING MY THINGS AGAIN
WE WILL ONLY ADD THAT EVERYONE WAS IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS AND THAT MANY OF THOSE PRESENT HAD KNOWN THE DEAD WOMAN AND SEEMED QUITE OBLIVIOUS OF THE FACT
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT SHE SHOULD OWE TO ME HER MORAL AND PHYSICAL RECOVERY THAT I SHOULD SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE WITH HER AND THAT HER LOVE SHOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER THAN ALL THE MAIDENLY LOVES IN THE WORLD
IF THE CEMETERY HAD ALWAYS BEEN KEPT LIKE IT IS NOW THERE WOULDN'T BE THE LIKE OF IT IN THE WORLD
SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE A BALL AND AS I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT MARGUERITE WOULD BE THERE I TRIED TO GET AN INVITATION AND SUCCEEDED
I NEVER TROUBLED MUCH ABOUT HER SCARCELY GOING TO SEE HER ONE NIGHT A WEEK
MY CHILD DO NOT TAKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU AMISS
HOW TIRESOME THAT IDIOT OF A COUNT IS THE MORE I SAW HER THE MORE SHE ENCHANTED ME
BUT SHE IS STILL NOT HALF BAD POOR OLD DUVERNOY CHAPTER 11 AT THIS POINT ARMAND STOPPED
I GAVE THE MONEY SHE LEFT TO THE POOR
I KNOW VERY WELL IT WOULDN'T SUIT ME AND I SHOULD SOON SEND THE OLD MAN ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER
TO-DAY I GOT UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE CURTAINS OF MY WINDOW AND WATCHED THE LIFE OF PARIS PASSING BELOW THE LIFE WITH WHICH I HAVE NOW NOTHING MORE TO DO
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK AND I WENT AT ONCE TO CALL UPON PRUDENCE WHO ASKED TO WHAT SHE OWED THIS EARLY VISIT
ONE STEP FURTHER AND YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE PATH YOU HAVE CHOSEN AND YOU WILL SUFFER ALL YOUR LIFE FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IN YOUR YOUTH
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT AND CARRYING ON HER ARM A LITTLE SILK PELISSE TO PROTECT HER AGAINST THE DAMP OF THE RIVER WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE
GOOD SAID SHE
SIR I BEG YOU TO EXCUSE MY VISIT AND MY COSTUME
I LIVE WITH HER
THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS CARRIED TO THE POINT OF SERVILITY NEVER TO THAT OF DISINTERESTEDNESS
I WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM THINKING OVER THINGS WHEN PRUDENCE ENTERED
I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IF I SPENT EVERY PENNY I HAD I WOULD WIN HER AND WIN MY RIGHT TO THE PLACE I HAD ABANDONED SO QUICKLY
AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
THE CHILD IS SMALL AND HE INCLUDES THE MAN
I TOLD HIM OF IT AND BEGGED HIS PERMISSION TO GO BACK TO HER EARLY PROMISING TO COME AGAIN ON THE MORROW
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TILL TO-DAY AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE TO YOU FOR MY ACTIONS
AND THAT LIKE VIRGIL'S SHEPHERD I HAD ONLY TO ENJOY THE PLEASURES THAT A GOD OR RATHER A GODDESS SET BEFORE ME
IF YOU KNEW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
I RETURNED HOME CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD FIND A LETTER FROM MARGUERITE
THERE WERE ROSEWOOD AND BUHL CABINETS AND TABLES SEVRES AND CHINESE VASES SAXE STATUETTES SATIN VELVET LACE
WE ARE SOMETIMES OBLIGED TO BUY THE SATISFACTION OF OUR SOULS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR BODIES AND WE SUFFER STILL MORE WHEN AFTERWARD THAT SATISFACTION IS DENIED US I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
DO YOU THINK A WOMAN IS GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR IT
THE EXALTATION OF THE MOMENT PERHAPS EXAGGERATED THE TRUTH OF THESE IMPRESSIONS BUT THAT WAS WHAT I FELT FRIEND AND THESE NEW FEELINGS SILENCED THE MEMORY OF THE HAPPY DAYS I HAD SPENT WITH YOU
HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST
I MUST TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT FOR TWO YEARS THE SIGHT OF THIS GIRL HAD MADE A STRANGE IMPRESSION ON ME WHENEVER I CAME ACROSS HER
SIR SAID JOSEPH COMING BACK TO ME IT IS TWO LADIES IT IS WE ARMAND CRIED A VOICE THAT I RECOGNISED AS THAT OF PRUDENCE
CHAPTER 6 I FOUND ARMAND IN BED
SHE SAT DOWN AS USUAL ON THE HEARTHRUG BEFORE THE FIRE AND GAZED SADLY INTO THE FLAMES
THAT IS WHY M
THEN I SAT BESIDE HER AND TRIED TO WARM HER WITH MY CARESSES
I COUNT ON YOU FOR THIS EASY HAPPINESS
ON THE TABLE WAS A BASIN HALF FULL OF WATER AND THE WATER WAS STAINED WITH STREAKS OF BLOOD
I WAS NEARLY FAINTING AND AT THE MOMENT OF WRITING THESE LINES I SEE THE WHOLE SCENE OVER AGAIN IN ALL ITS IMPOSING REALITY
DUVERNOY APPEARED AND ASKED ME INTO HER BOUDOIR
CHAPTER 20 MY FATHER WAS SEATED IN MY ROOM IN HIS DRESSING-GOWN
WE WILL WALK THERE A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD I SAW MARGUERITE FROM THE STREET AT A WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LARGE ROOMS OF THE RESTAURANT PULLING THE CAMELLIAS OF HER BOUQUET TO PIECES ONE BY ONE
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR I WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AND I WAS DRENCHED WITH SWEAT
AIR I BURST INTO TEARS OPENED THE WINDOW AND A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARD THE PRIEST ENTERED
I HAVE ONLY KNOWN MARGUERITE FOR TWO DAYS SHE HAS ONLY BEEN MY MISTRESS SINCE YESTERDAY AND SHE HAS ALREADY SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED MY THOUGHTS MY HEART AND MY LIFE THAT THE VISIT OF THE COMTE DE G
POOR SOULS
SHE SMILED AT ME BUT WITH AN EFFORT FOR IN SPITE OF HERSELF HER EYES WERE VEILED WITH TEARS
IS HE STILL HER LOVER
IF I AM DEAD WHEN YOU COME BACK SHOW YOUR FATHER WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR HIM AND TELL HIM THAT IN WRITING THESE LINES THE POOR WOMAN TO WHOM HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO WRITE SO CONSOLING A LETTER WEPT TEARS OF GRATITUDE AND PRAYED GOD FOR HIM
ONCE BEFORE I WAS ILL AND YOU THOUGH YOU DID NOT KNOW ME THOUGH YOU HAD HAD NOTHING FROM ME BUT AN IMPERTINENCE THE DAY I MET YOU FIRST YOU CAME TO INQUIRE AFTER ME EVERY DAY
HUGO HAS WRITTEN MARION DELORME MUSSET HAS WRITTEN BERNERETTE ALEXANDRE DUMAS HAS WRITTEN FERNANDE THE THINKERS AND POETS OF ALL TIME HAVE BROUGHT TO THE COURTESAN THE OFFERING OF THEIR PITY AND AT TIMES A GREAT MAN HAS REHABILITATED THEM WITH HIS LOVE AND EVEN WITH HIS NAME
ON A LARGE TABLE AGAINST THE WALL A TABLE THREE FEET IN WIDTH AND SIX IN LENGTH GLITTERED ALL THE TREASURES OF AUCOC AND ODIOT
I SHALL NEVER SEE THIS WOMAN AGAIN AND IF I LIKED HER BEFORE MEETING HER IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT NOW THAT I KNOW HER BAH
THE COUGH WHICH EVERY TIME THAT I HEARD IT SEEMED TO GO THROUGH MY CHEST HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED
ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THE COUNT
SHE DID NOT REPLY
I LOOKED AT MY WATCH
ALL THAT CALLED UP IN MY HEART THOUGHTS WHICH RAISED ME IN MY OWN EYES WITH A SORT OF HOLY PRIDE UNKNOWN TILL THEN
THAT IS THE COMTE DE G WHO WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH MARGUERITE
LASTLY WE WENT TO MARGUERITE'S GRAVE ON WHICH THE FIRST RAYS OF THE APRIL SUN WERE BRINGING THE FIRST LEAVES INTO BUD
SIR SAID HE MADAME WAS NOT UP AND STILL ASLEEP BUT AS SOON AS SHE RINGS THE LETTER WILL BE TAKEN TO HER AND IF THERE IS ANY REPLY IT WILL BE SENT SHE WAS ASLEEP
EVERY TIME THAT I SAW A WOMAN AT A DISTANCE I FANCIED IT WAS NANINE BRINGING ME AN ANSWER
HOW I SPENT THE REST OF THE DAY I DO NOT KNOW
CHAPTER 4 TWO DAYS AFTER THE SALE WAS ENDED
THIRTY SAID THE FIRST BIDDER IN A TONE WHICH SEEMED TO DEFY FURTHER COMPETITION
IF SO WHY DID SHE NOT CHOOSE GASTON WHO WAS RICH WITTY AND CHARMING AND WHY DID SHE CARE FOR ME WHOM SHE HAD THOUGHT SO RIDICULOUS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SEEN ME
YOU CAN NOT CONCEIVE IN THE MIDST OF WHAT GILDED MISERY THE POOR THING IS DYING
IT IS BETTER PERHAPS FOR YOU NOT TO SEE HER AGAIN THAN TO SEE HER AS SHE IS
I HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A FEVER FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS THAT I COULD NOT WRITE YOU A WORD
PRUDENCE WAS STANDING LOOKING AROUND THE PLACE
NOW THIS DEMOISELLE GAUTIER IT APPEARS SHE LIVED A BIT FREE IF YOU'LL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO
THE PLACARD FURTHER ANNOUNCED THAT THE ROOMS AND FURNITURE COULD BE SEEN ON THE 13TH AND 14TH
FOR THESE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO BE MERRY WHEN THEY ARE MERRY WELL WHEN THEY WANT TO SUP SCEPTICS LIKE THEMSELVES
ARMAND DUVAL AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT
THEN TURNING TOWARD ME HE SAID
SHE WAS THERE WHEN YOUR LETTER CAME AND WE BOTH CRIED OVER IT
THE IDEA THAT THAT MAN IS HER LOVER HURTS ME HORRIBLY IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED PRUDENCE
NANINE MET ME WITH A LIGHT
FINALLY I ASKED MYSELF WHAT SHE WOULD REPLY TO ME
YOUR LETTER GAVE ME A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN
AH YOU HERE SHE SAID WHERE IS MARGUERITE IN HER DRESSING-ROOM I WILL WAIT
I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL COLD
SHAMEFUL IT IS BUT THIS MOTHER ANSWERED THE DAUGHTER THAT THEY HAD ALREADY SCARCE ENOUGH FOR TWO AND WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOR THREE
DUVERNOY'S WINDOW REMAINED CLOSED
DEAD AND THINKING OF ME WRITING AND REPEATING MY NAME POOR DEAR MARGUERITE AND ARMAND GIVING FREE OUTLET TO HIS THOUGHTS AND HIS TEARS HELD OUT HIS HAND TO ME AND CONTINUED
YOUR MARGUERITE OF OLD TIMES IS SADLY CHANGED
NOW SAID SHE COME AND SIT DOWN BY ME AND LET'S HAVE A TALK PRUDENCE WAS RIGHT
NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN
I QUESTIONED HER AS TO THIS SUDDEN DISTRESS WHICH ALARMED ME BY ITS VIOLENCE
WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT
I HAD NOTHING MORE TO ASK OF HER
DOUBTLESS IT MUST SEEM A BOLD THING TO ATTEMPT TO DEDUCE THESE GRAND RESULTS OUT OF THE MEAGRE SUBJECT THAT I DEAL WITH
JANUARY 10
YOU KNOW THAT FORGETFULNESS OF EVERYTHING WHICH COMES OF A VIOLENT CONFIDENT RECIPROCATED LOVE
YES HE ADDED AFTER GLANCING AT THE ADDRESSES THEY ARE FROM MY FATHER AND SISTER
DEAD
IT WAS QUITE NATURAL ARMAND
NEVERTHELESS THE NIGHT WENT ON AND MARGUERITE DID NOT RETURN
HIS FAMILY ARE ALWAYS REPROACHING HIM FOR HIS AFFECTION FOR MARGUERITE
TO MME
THUS SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO EXCULPATE HERSELF AND WHAT I WANTED WAS FOR HER TO EXCULPATE HERSELF
IT IS NO DOUBT A RETURN FOR THE HUMILIATIONS WHICH THEY OFTEN HAVE TO SUBMIT TO ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY SEE EVERY DAY
I MUST BE GOING TO MY CLUB HE SAID
NATURALLY I BEGGED HIM TO EMPLOY THE GREATEST DISCRETION IN REGARD TO MY FATHER AND ON LEAVING HIM I REJOINED MARGUERITE WHO WAS WAITING FOR ME AT JULIE DUPRAT'S WHERE SHE HAD GONE IN PREFERENCE TO GOING TO LISTEN TO THE MORALIZINGS OF PRUDENCE
WE SPEND MOST OF OUR EVENING TOGETHER OR SHE CALLS TO ME WHEN SHE COMES IN
I HAD TO SEE HER THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER THE DAY WHEN THE THOUGHT HAD OCCURRED TO ME
IF ANY ONE HAD SAID TO ME YOU CAN BE HER LOVER FOR TEN POUNDS I WOULD HAVE REFUSED
HIS BACK WAS BOWED HIS HEAD BENT TOWARD THE GROUND HIS LIPS DROOPING HIS EYES VACANT
HE DID NOT REPROACH ME
I LIKE YOU VERY MUCH
MARGUERITE WAS ALWAYS PRESENT AT EVERY FIRST NIGHT AND PASSED EVERY EVENING EITHER AT THE THEATRE OR THE BALL
I WENT BACK TO GASTON AND TOLD HIM OF THE ARRANGEMENT I HAD MADE FOR HIM AND FOR ME
TALK MY CHILDREN SAID PRUDENCE GOING OUT AND CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER AS IF TO FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE TONE IN WHICH SHE HAD SAID THESE WORDS
THE PORTER HAD RECEIVED NOTHING BUT I STILL HOPED IN MY SERVANT
HE WAS NOT AT HIS HOTEL NOR ANYWHERE WHERE THERE WAS A CHANCE OF MY FINDING HIM WELL YOU MUST TRY AGAIN TO-MORROW I AM VERY MUCH INCLINED TO WAIT TILL HE SENDS FOR ME
THAT WHEN I MET YOU TO-DAY AFTER NOT HAVING SEEN YOU FOR TWO YEARS YOU MADE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY HEART AND MIND THAN EVER
AT THE PALAIS ROYAL AND I AT THE OPERA SAID HE
I CAN NOT LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS
TWO HOURS LATER I WAS AT THE RUE DE PROVENCE
GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD
SENT ME SOME MONEY YESTERDAY
PRUDENCE HERSELF WAS TAKEN IN AND FINALLY THOUGHT THAT I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN MARGUERITE
TAKE ME
WHAT I HAD DONE WAS THEREFORE NOT MERELY RIDICULOUS IT WAS INDELICATE
HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL THEN WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME MY FRIEND IF I WERE THE DUCHESS SO AND SO IF I HAD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IF I WERE YOUR MISTRESS AND HAD ANOTHER LOVER YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK ME
I KNOW
BUT THE INTEREST YOU STILL TAKE IN ME MAKES MY SUFFERING LESS
WE HEARD THE SOUND OF A PIANO
HOW MANY HAPPY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY ARE HAPPY
SHE REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED YOU AND SHE WOULDN'T BE UNFAITHFUL TO YOU FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
AND I WILL COME BACK AS SOON AS I CAN YOU WILL COME BACK SHE SAID LOOKING AT ME WITH HAGGARD EYES
IT IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD
IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND WHENEVER A CAMELLIA FADES I HAVE ORDERS TO REPLACE IT WHO GAVE YOU THE ORDER A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO CRIED THE FIRST TIME HE CAME HERE
PARDON ME IF I DO NOT WRITE A LONGER LETTER BUT THOSE WHO SAY THEY ARE GOING TO CURE ME WEAR ME OUT WITH BLOODLETTING AND MY HAND REFUSES TO WRITE ANY MORE
A FORTUNE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR IS IN FRANCE AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE
IT IS BECAUSE I SHALL NOT LIVE AS LONG AS OTHERS AND I HAVE PROMISED MYSELF TO LIVE MORE QUICKLY DON'T SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT I ENTREAT YOU OH MAKE YOURSELF EASY SHE CONTINUED LAUGHING
I CAN NOT HELP WANTING TO EXPLAIN ALL MY CONDUCT TO YOU AND I HAVE WRITTEN YOU A LETTER
THE COMTE DE G WHO CAME FROM LONDON ON PURPOSE AND THE DUKE WHO WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO FOOTMEN
THE GRAVE-DIGGERS PUT BACK THE SHROUD OVER THE FACE OF THE CORPSE FASTENED UP THE COFFIN TOOK HOLD OF EACH END OF IT AND BEGAN TO CARRY IT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN TOLD TO TAKE IT
BUT I DID NOT RESPOND SO AS TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER HER AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE SHE REMEMBERED
HOW THE SIGHT OF THE LIFE AND HAPPINESS OF OTHERS GIVES A DESIRE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE IN THE SOLITUDE OF THEIR SOUL AND IN THE SHADOW OF THEIR SICK-ROOM ONLY WANTED TO DIE SOON
AT THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO DO TO SHOW HIM THE PROOF THAT SINCE I WAS YOUR MISTRESS I HAD SPARED NO SACRIFICE TO BE FAITHFUL TO YOU WITHOUT ASKING FOR MORE MONEY THAN YOU HAD TO GIVE ME
HE HAS GONE IN FOR A MOMENT HE IS NOT STAYING BECAUSE YOU ARE WAITING HERE
BUT REMEMBER THAT THERE IS NOT ONLY THE MISTRESS BUT THE FAMILY
THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER
WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT NOTHING TELL ME I BEG OF YOU OR I SHALL THINK YOU ARE STILL LAUGHING AT ME YOU WON'T BE CROSS WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO BE CROSS WELL THERE WAS A SUFFICIENT REASON WHY I WENT IN ALONE WHAT SOME ONE WAS WAITING FOR ME HERE IF SHE HAD THRUST A KNIFE INTO ME SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HURT ME MORE
HAVE YOU READ THE VOLUME ALL THROUGH WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE TWO LINES THAT I WROTE IN IT I REALIZED AT ONCE THAT THE WOMAN TO WHOM YOU HAD GIVEN THE VOLUME MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY CATEGORY FOR I COULD NOT TAKE THOSE TWO LINES AS A MERE EMPTY COMPLIMENT YOU WERE RIGHT
COME AND SEE HER
I GAVE HER A LAST KISS SAYING
DUVERNOY WAS NOT IN A LAUGHING HUMOUR AND IN A REALLY MOVED VOICE SHE SAID TO ME THAT SINCE MY RETURN THAT IS TO SAY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD LEFT NO OCCASION UNTRIED WHICH COULD GIVE PAIN TO MARGUERITE THAT SHE WAS COMPLETELY UPSET BY IT AND THAT THE SCENE OF LAST NIGHT AND MY ANGRY LETTER OF THE MORNING HAD FORCED HER TO TAKE TO HER BED
TIME WENT BY THE IMPRESSION IF NOT THE MEMORY FADED GRADUALLY FROM MY MIND
I SCARCELY KNEW MYSELF
ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS M
YOU DISCOVER THAT THIS PERSON WAS ALMOST TOUCHING YOU AND HAS PASSED CLOSE TO YOU MANY TIMES IN YOUR LIFE WITHOUT YOUR NOTICING IT
DECEMBER 25
I RAN LIKE A MADMAN LIKE A THIEF TO THE HOTEL DE PARIS
DUVAL WAS DEEPLY AGITATED
I MADE A PACKAGE OF THEM AND YOU CAN SEND HERE FOR THEM
THEY KNOW TOO WELL THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE THEREUPON SHE GOT UP AND TAKING THE CANDLE PUT IT ON THE MANTEL-PIECE AND LOOKED AT HERSELF IN THE GLASS
TAKE IT BACK
WE WILL GO AND LIVE THERE AND THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT OF WHAT I WAS
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A SAD DEATH FOR IN HER WORLD ONE HAS FRIENDS ONLY WHEN ONE IS PERFECTLY WELL AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF I BEGAN TO FEEL MELANCHOLY OVER THE FATE OF MARGUERITE GAUTIER
IT WAS THE MONTMARTRE CEMETERY
THE PURE MEMORIES THAT HE AWAKENED IN ME
SHE OUGHT TO FIND ME SUPREMELY FOOLISH AND HER SILENCE WAS NOT EVEN THAT OF RANCOUR
ARMAND HAD NOT YET RETURNED
NATURALLY WE HAVE NO FRIENDS
AND THIS GENTLEMAN ONLY FOR FIVE MINUTES
YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY THREE WEEKS I SAID
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO HOLD ME TO LIFE
IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY HE CAME TO BEG MARGUERITE TO LET HIM STILL VISIT HER PROMISING THAT HE WOULD TAKE HER AS SHE WAS SO LONG AS HE MIGHT SEE HER AND SWEARING THAT HE WOULD NEVER UTTER A REPROACH AGAINST HER NOT THOUGH HE WERE TO DIE OF IT
IN SHORT SAY NOTHING TO MARGUERITE AND BRING HER BACK TO PARIS
ONE DAY THE GIRL'S FACE WAS TRANSFIGURED
HE INQUIRED OF ME WHAT IT CONTAINED
MY POOR FRIEND
IS MARGUERITE WITH YOU NO HOW IS SHE SHE IS NOT WELL IS SHE NOT COMING DID YOU EXPECT HER MADAME DUVERNOY REDDENED AND REPLIED WITH A CERTAIN CONSTRAINT
IT WAS NOT UNMADE
BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO PAY AND IN ORDER NOT TO ASK YOU FOR MONEY SHE SOLD HER HORSES AND HER SHAWLS AND PAWNED HER JEWELS
HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARD MARGUERITE PALE AS DEATH PUT ON HER PELISSE AND LEFT THE BALL
MY DOCTOR WHOM I HAD MADE HER MEET HAD TOLD ME THAT ONLY REST AND CALM COULD PRESERVE HER HEALTH SO THAT IN PLACE OF SUPPER AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I SUCCEEDED IN SUBSTITUTING A HYGIENIC REGIME AND REGULAR SLEEP
BUT SINCE PRUDENCE HAS TOLD YOU ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO AGREE BEFOREHAND INSTEAD OF AGREEING AFTERWARD
THE BURIAL TOOK PLACE TO-DAY
SHE WAS BUT TWENTY AND HER MALADY SLEEPING BUT NOT SUBDUED CONTINUED TO GIVE HER THOSE FEVERISH DESIRES WHICH ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE RESULT OF DISEASES OF THE CHEST
SHE WILL DO YOU CREDIT THESE SIMPLE REFLECTIONS OF GASTON SHOWED ME HOW ABSURD HAD BEEN MY SUSCEPTIBILITIES
SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
AS I THOUGHT OF HOW THE BARRIERS WHICH MY IMAGINATION HAD PLACED BETWEEN MARGUERITE AND MYSELF HAD DISAPPEARED OF HOW SHE WAS NOW MINE
AND AFTERWARD SHE HAD SUPPER AT HOME ALONE WITH THE COMTE DE G I BELIEVE SO MY BREAKING WITH HER HAD NOT CHANGED ONE OF HER HABITS
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE A LITTLE PUNCH AND I COULD EAT A LITTLE CHICKEN SAID PRUDENCE
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAD MADE THIS LOVE THE HOPE THE DREAM THE FORGIVENESS--OF MY LIFE IMPLICITLY WELL SIR EMBRACE ME ONCE AS YOU WOULD EMBRACE YOUR DAUGHTER AND I SWEAR TO YOU THAT THAT KISS THE ONLY CHASTE KISS I HAVE EVER HAD WILL MAKE ME STRONG AGAINST MY LOVE AND THAT WITHIN A WEEK YOUR SON WILL BE ONCE MORE AT YOUR SIDE PERHAPS UNHAPPY FOR A TIME BUT CURED FOREVER YOU ARE A NOBLE CHILD REPLIED YOUR FATHER KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD AND YOU ARE MAKING AN ATTEMPT FOR WHICH GOD WILL REWARD YOU
ALL THE SAME HE HAS PAID MY BAILIFF AND SENT AWAY THE MAN
IT WAS THE DRESSING-ROOM LAID OUT WITH ALL THE ARTICLES OF TOILET IN WHICH THE DEAD WOMAN'S EXTRAVAGANCE SEEMED TO BE SEEN AT ITS HEIGHT
YOU ARE INDEED HAPPY TO BE UNDER A WARM SKY AND NOT LIKE ME WITH A WHOLE WINTER OF ICE ON YOUR CHEST
BUT WRITTEN BY A GIRL LIKE ME SUCH A LETTER MIGHT SEEM TO BE A LIE UNLESS DEATH HAD SANCTIFIED IT BY ITS AUTHORITY AND INSTEAD OF A LETTER IT WERE A CONFESSION
WHO GAVE YOU THIS I ASKED THE MAN
AH MY DEAR FRIEND THERE ARE MEN MADE ON PURPOSE FOR SUCH OCCASIONS
HAS BEEN WITH HER FOR A LONG TIME
NOW I COMMAND YOU
YOU BOTH EXAGGERATE YOUR LOVE
IF I COME OUT OF THIS ROOM ALIVE I WILL MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOUSE WE LIVED IN TOGETHER BUT I WILL NEVER LEAVE IT UNTIL I AM DEAD
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY ARE
BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
I NEVER SAW SUCH AN ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE
SHE HAS BEEN LAUGHING TOO MUCH AND SHE IS SPITTING BLOOD
IF YOU LEFT ME ALONE I SHOULD NOT SLEEP WHEN I RETURNED HOME HE CONTINUED WITHOUT NEEDING TO PAUSE AND RECOLLECT HIMSELF SO FRESH WERE ALL THE DETAILS IN HIS MIND I DID NOT GO TO BED BUT BEGAN TO REFLECT OVER THE DAY'S ADVENTURE
ALL THOSE WHO COME ABOUT WOMEN LIKE ME HAVE AN INTEREST IN CALCULATING THEIR SLIGHTEST WORDS IN THINKING OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR MOST INSIGNIFICANT ACTIONS
I SEND BACK YOUR KEY WHICH I HAVE NEVER USED AND WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO YOU IF YOU ARE OFTEN ILL AS YOU WERE YESTERDAY AS YOU WILL SEE I WAS UNABLE TO END MY LETTER WITHOUT A TOUCH OF IMPERTINENT IRONY WHICH PROVED HOW MUCH IN LOVE I STILL WAS
I SCRUTINIZED ARMAND FOR EVERY MOMENT I WAS AFRAID LEST THE EMOTIONS WHICH HE WAS VISIBLY REPRESSING SHOULD PROVE TOO MUCH FOR HIM
CHAPTER 27 YOU HAVE READ IT SAID ARMAND WHEN I HAD FINISHED THE MANUSCRIPT
THE GOOD MAN IMAGINED I WAS RUINED AND QUESTIONED ME AS TO THE CAUSE OF MY DECISION
WELL SAID HE IN A TREMBLING VOICE
WITH MME
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN
THE COFFIN WAS OF OAK AND THEY BEGAN TO UNSCREW THE LID
I AM SURE AT THIS VERY MOMENT ONE OF HIS SERVANTS IS PROWLING ABOUT IN THE STREET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHO GOES IN AH POOR MARGUERITE SAID GASTON SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO AND PLAYING A WALTZ
AS FOR HIM HIS EYES AGAIN BEGAN TO FILL WITH TEARS
THE NIGHT HE WENT AWAY SHE WENT TO THE THEATRE AS USUAL AND YET SHE HAD CRIED WHEN HE SAID GOOD-BYE TO HER JUST THEN NANINE APPEARED TO TELL US THAT SUPPER WAS SERVED
THE SCIENCE OF GOOD AND EVIL IS ACQUIRED FOREVER
THERE WAS A SOUND OF LOUD LAUGHTER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF DOING WHY HASN'T SHE ANSWERED ME IF SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH ME BECAUSE SHE REALIZES SHE WAS MISTAKEN IN LETTING HERSELF LOVE YOU
I HAVE COME TO TROUBLE YOU ARMAND FOR I HAVE TWO THINGS TO ASK
THAT IS WHAT I ASKED MYSELF IN AFFRIGHT AS I STOOD IN THE VACANT ROOM GAZING AT THE CLOCK WHICH POINTED TO MIDNIGHT AND SEEMED TO SAY TO ME THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO HOPE FOR MY MISTRESS'S RETURN
HE IS QUITE NICE THAT FELLOW
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT SAID THE GARDENER
DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF
IT WOULD BE GOOD OF GOD TO LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE I DIE
I HAVE TOLD THE READER ALL THAT I LEARNED
AND THEN GIRLS LIKE ME WHAT DOES IT MATTER ONE MORE OR LESS
I DON'T DESPAIR OF SEEING YOU ONE DAY AT THE BACK OF HER BOX AND OF BEARING THAT YOU ARE RUINING YOURSELF FOR HER
THERE MUST BE SOME CAUSE INDEPENDENT OF HER WILL TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM ME AND THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE CONVINCED I WAS THAT THIS CAUSE COULD ONLY BE SOME MISHAP OR OTHER
MARGUERITE WAS LIVID WHITE
POOR OLD MAN HE WOULD BE GREATLY EMBARRASSED TO OFFER HER ANYTHING ELSE PRUDENCE THEN TOLD ME HOW MARGUERITE HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DUKE AT BAGNERES
PEOPLE CAN SEE BEFOREHAND THE EFFECT OF THE THINGS
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME
I AM GOING TO DIE
SHE LAY BACK ON A GREAT SOFA HER DRESS UNDONE HOLDING ONE HAND ON HER HEART AND LETTING THE OTHER HANG BY HER SIDE
IT IS QUITE TRUE WHO WAS THIS ARMAND A FELLOW WHO SQUANDERED ON HER THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD AND THEN HAD TO LEAVE HER
DE N AND SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO INSPIRE A PASSION NOT LESS GREAT THAN THAT WHICH MARGUERITE HAD INSPIRED IN ME
YOU MAY SAY THAT HE WAS UNATTRACTIVE TO HER AND THAT AS SHE WAS SPLENDIDLY KEPT BY THE DUKE SHE WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE A MAN WHO WAS ATTRACTIVE TO HER IF SHE WERE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOVER
I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT YOU AND HE PROMISED TO TELL YOU ABOUT ME
ARMAND AND I FOLLOWED A FEW STEPS BEHIND
THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER
AND THIS ONE I INQUIRED POINTING TO THE OTHER MINIATURE
I LOOK AFTER HER WELL AND I LET HER HAVE HER CAMELLIAS AT AN HONEST PRICE
NO ONE COMES TO SEE ME
I WOULD RATHER THAT SHE HAD BEEN SAD
THE COMTE DE G
THE COMTE DE G
THE COMTE DE G
HE SEEMED TO SEE THE SHADOW OF HIS CHILD AND GOING UP TO HER HE TOOK HER HANDS EMBRACED AND WEPT OVER HER AND WITHOUT EVEN ASKING HER WHO SHE WAS BEGGED HER TO LET HIM LOVE IN HER THE LIVING IMAGE OF HIS DEAD CHILD
YOU MAY BELIEVE ME OR NOT SIR I NEVER KNEW THE YOUNG LADY
TEN FRANCS TWELVE SAID A VOICE AFTER A LONGISH SILENCE
HE WILL HATE ME I HAD TO SET UP BETWEEN US AS MUCH FOR ME AS FOR YOU AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER
THEY ARE AS NECESSARY TO YOU AS AIR IS TO LIFE AND IT MAY BE ABSURD BUT I LIKE YOU BETTER SHOWY THAN SIMPLE THEN YOU NO LONGER LOVE ME FOOLISH CREATURE IF YOU LOVED ME YOU WOULD LET ME LOVE YOU MY OWN WAY
MARGUERITE GAVE ME A LITTLE NOD AND SAID AND MY SWEETS HERE THEY ARE SHE LOOKED AT ME AS SHE TOOK THEM
A FEW MINUTES AFTER THERE WAS ANOTHER RING
ALL RIGHT SHE ROSE OPENED THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO PLAY THE INVITATION A LA VALSE AS FAR AS THE FAMOUS PASSAGE IN THE MAJOR WHICH ALWAYS STOPPED HER
FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY
WHAT ELSE WAS THERE FOR ME TO DO MY FRIEND
HOWEVER I DID NOT WISH TO GO AWAY WITHOUT LETTING MARGUERITE KNOW WHY I WENT
PERHAPS SHE HAD SOME SUSPICION OR OTHER I THOUGHT AND WENT TO PARIS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY VISIT TO MY FATHER WAS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR A DAY OFF
JULIE PUT ON SOME ROUGE FOR ME WITHOUT WHICH I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE A CORPSE
I SHALL BE QUITE COMPOSED
ARNOULD TO SEE IF A VEHICLE COULD BE OBTAINED
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
I FOUND MARGUERITE NOT WAITING FOR ME AS SHE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE BUT SITTING BY THE FIRE WHICH THE WEATHER STILL MADE NECESSARY
OR I SHALL ACCEPT
THE INSPECTOR WENT IN FRONT
I DON'T ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE MARGUERITE BUT LIVE WITH HER AS YOU DID AT THE BEGINNING
WILL YOU GO ABROAD
AS I EXPECTED SHE BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER BOX
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW WHAT I MADE THAT WOMAN SUFFER HOW CRUEL I HAVE BEEN TO HER
I WENT OUT YESTERDAY IN MY CARRIAGE
WE MUST GO AND GET SOME SWEETS
IF MEN KNEW WHAT THEY CAN HAVE FOR A TEAR THEY WOULD BE BETTER LOVED AND WE SHOULD BE LESS RUINOUS TO THEM
THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL IT WAS TRUE BUT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL I MIGHT BE I OUGHT NOT TO MAKE USE OF MY BEAUTY TO SPOIL THE FUTURE OF A YOUNG MAN BY SUCH EXPENDITURE AS I WAS CAUSING
HE WAS READING
YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HER ALONE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
THERE REMAINED THE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR FROM MY FATHER
I HAVE BEEN IN BED FOR A MONTH AND I THINK SO MUCH OF YOUR ESTEEM THAT I WRITE EVERY DAY THE JOURNAL OF MY LIFE FROM THE MOMENT WE LEFT EACH OTHER TO THE MOMENT WHEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO WRITE NO LONGER
SHE SAID NOTHING TO MAKE ME SUPPOSE THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN TO MARGUERITE
AFTER THE SUPPER WHICH WAS NOISY AS COULD BE THERE WAS GAMBLING
AND INSTEAD OF BEING TOO HAPPY THAT SHE SHOULD GRANT ME ALL THAT SHE DID I WANTED TO HAVE HER ALL TO MYSELF AND TO MAKE HER SEVER AT ONE STROKE ALL HER PAST RELATIONS WHICH WERE THE REVENUE OF HER FUTURE
THIS DESIRE POSSESSED MY MIND AND WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE OF A WILL WHICH HAD BEGUN TO REASSERT ITSELF IN A BODY SO LONG INERT
THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER BUT MARGUERITE WAS NOT THERE
ACCEPT WITHOUT INQUIRING INTO MY REASONS
WE MUST TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION MY DEAR ARMAND FOR HE WILL HAVE ME WATCHED WHILE I AM THERE
IT WAS ONLY TO GET RID OF THE COUNT
A VOICE WAS CALLING PRUDENCE COME NOW YOU MUST GO SAID MME
THEN THE THOUGHT OF THE PAIN IT WOULD GIVE TO MARGUERITE CALMED ME A LITTLE
THAT IS WHAT ANNOYED HIM THE MOST FOR HE SAW HOW MUCH WE REALLY LOVE ONE ANOTHER WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEN HOLD TOGETHER MY GOOD MARGUERITE AND LET THE STORM PASS OVER WILL IT PASS IT WILL HAVE TO BUT YOUR FATHER WILL NOT STOP THERE WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE CAN DO HOW DO I KNOW
SHE HAS HEAPS OF DEBTS
SO THAT ALL SEEMED EQUALLY PLEASED WITH ONE ANOTHER
WELL SAID MARGUERITE
I WATCHED IT FADE AWAY IN THE DISTANCE AND THEN STARTED ON MY WAY AGAIN
WHOM ARE YOU BOWING TO I ASKED
I RETURNED THE LETTER TO ARMAND WHO HAD NO DOUBT READ IT OVER AGAIN IN HIS MIND WHILE I WAS READING IT ON PAPER FOR HE SAID TO ME AS HE TOOK IT
WHEN HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE SEEMED AFRAID OF BEING BADLY RECEIVED
MME
MME
MME
MME
MME
I SAW THE HOLD WHICH I HAD UPON THIS WOMAN AND I TOOK A COWARDLY ADVANTAGE OF IT
AT LAST I CAME TO MYSELF A LITTLE
WELL BUT THE DUKE WHAT DUKE MY JEALOUS OLD DUKE HE WILL KNOW NOTHING AND IF HE SHOULD HE WOULD FORGIVE YOU AH NO HE WOULD LEAVE ME AND WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME YOU RISK THAT FOR SOME ONE ELSE HOW DO YOU KNOW BY THE ORDER YOU GAVE NOT TO ADMIT ANY ONE TO-NIGHT IT IS TRUE
ALL I COULD DO WAS TO WRITE AND TELL YOU WHERE I WAS GOING SO THAT YOU COULD SEE ME AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU MYSELF
WHAT WOULD YOU BE NOW IF YOUR FATHER HAD HAD YOUR IDEAS AND HAD GIVEN UP HIS LIFE TO EVERY IMPULSE OF THIS KIND INSTEAD OF ROOTING HIMSELF FIRMLY IN CONVICTIONS OF HONOUR AND STEADFASTNESS
I WAS ALREADY FEELING SAD WHEN I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER
SO I SAID TO MYSELF AS I LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT THOUGH IF I HAD REFLECTED AS CALMLY AS I PROFESSED TO I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IN THIS NEW AND TURBULENT LIFE OF MARGUERITE THE ATTEMPT TO SILENCE A CONSTANT THOUGHT A CEASELESS MEMORY
WHEN WE WERE ALONE MY FATHER ROSE AND LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL-PIECE SAID TO ME
NO I NEVER SPOKE TO HER AND YOU COME HERE TOO
WELL I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND THAT MARGUERITE DOES NOT PUT HERSELF OUT FOR ME I SAID WITH A FORCED SMILE
IT WAS ONLY JUST IN TIME
WE MIGHT CITE THE INITIALS OF MANY MORE OF THOSE WHO FOUND THEMSELVES NOT WITHOUT SOME MUTUAL SURPRISE SIDE BY SIDE IN ONE ROOM
I WAS AFRAID OF IT SHE SAID
HE IS VERY RICH
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE POSITION YOU REJECT IT AS UNWORTHY OF YOU
DO YOU LOVE ME ENOUGH FOR THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST SUCH DEVOTION
AND MY FRIEND'S WINDOW OPENED GAILY UPON HIS GARDEN FROM WHICH A REVIVING BREATH OF HEALTH SEEMED TO COME TO HIM
IT IS I WHO WOULDN'T ACCEPT THEN
HE REPLIED THAT SHE NEVER CAME IN BEFORE ELEVEN OR A QUARTER PAST ELEVEN
WHO WHEN SHE WAS DEAD DUG A GRAVE FOR HER AND WATERED IT WITH HIS TEARS AND BURIED HIS HEART IN IT
WAIT TILL AFTER TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW GO BACK TO PARIS
ONE DAY THEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE WAS TO HAVE A CHILD AND ALL THAT REMAINED TO HER OF CHASTITY LEAPED FOR JOY
AND YET I RECOGNISED IN THIS FACE THE JOYOUS WHITE AND ROSE FACE THAT I HAD SEEN SO OFTEN
HOW PALE I AM SHE SAID AS SHE FASTENED HER DRESS AND PASSED HER FINGERS OVER HER LOOSENED HAIR
I RETURNED TO MY SEAT
I RETURNED TO MY SEAT
SINCE SHE GOT SO ILL THE OLD DUKE HAS NOT RETURNED
YOU CAN TELL ME THE REST OF THE STORY ANOTHER DAY ARE YOU TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT QUITE THE CONTRARY THEN I WILL GO ON
IT IS THE ONLY ONE IT WAS FATED THAT THE POOR MAN WAS NOT TO SAY A SINGLE WORD
I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE
HE OBSERVED IT NO DOUBT FOR HE WENT ON
TO PRUDENCE
AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST
THEN I RETURNED TO PARIS AND ASKED AFTER YOU
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR I SAW MARGUERITE'S CARRIAGE AT SOME DISTANCE COMING FROM THE ROND-POINT TO THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE
BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL COME TO PREFER A QUIET LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND KEEP YOUR BEAUTY UNSPOILED YOU THINK LIKE THAT TO-NIGHT BECAUSE THE WINE HAS MADE YOU SAD BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PATIENCE THAT YOU PRETEND TO PERMIT ME TO SAY MARGUERITE THAT YOU WERE ILL FOR TWO MONTHS AND THAT FOR TWO MONTHS I CAME TO ASK AFTER YOU EVERY DAY IT IS TRUE BUT WHY DID YOU NOT COME UP BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW YOU THEN NEED YOU HAVE BEEN SO PARTICULAR WITH A GIRL LIKE ME ONE MUST ALWAYS BE PARTICULAR WITH A WOMAN
SHE SAID THAT I MIGHT BE IN THE WAY YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE
OH IT IS NOTHING
ALREADY PREPARED TO BELIEVE WHATEVER EXCUSE SHE MADE
THE PAST SEEMED TO HER SENSITIVE NATURE AS IF IT WERE ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF HER ILLNESS AND A SORT OF SUPERSTITION LED HER TO HOPE THAT GOD WOULD RESTORE TO HER BOTH HEALTH AND BEAUTY IN RETURN FOR HER REPENTANCE AND CONVERSION
NOW UNDERSTAND SAID MARGUERITE YOU ARE ALWAYS TO SAY TO THAT IDIOT THAT I AM NOT IN OR THAT I WILL NOT SEE HIM
I WAS WITH ERNEST DE AH I REMEMBER SAID MARGUERITE WITH A SMILE
YOU FORGIVE ME I SAID
IT WAS SIGNED ARMAND DUVAL
WE SPENT SIX MONTHS TOGETHER
BUT I FEARED THAT SHE WOULD REVENGE HERSELF ON ME BY SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE ME AND I RETURNED HOME AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE RUE D'ANTIN
I WENT INTO THE DRESSING-ROOM OPENED THE WINDOW AND CALLED PRUDENCE SEVERAL TIMES
SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL
I HAVE ONLY KNOWN YOU FOR TWO MONTHS REPLIED THE COUNT
ARE YOU COMING I SAT STILL AND DID NOT MOVE
I MIGHT HAVE GONE IN BUT I DARED NOT
AT ALL EVENTS HE GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY THE GENERAL OUTLINES WERE ALWAYS THE SAME
NEVERTHELESS SINCE THE MOMENT OF THE SALE HER NAME CAME TO MY EARS SO FREQUENTLY AND OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I HAVE MENTIONED IN THE LAST CHAPTER THAT NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SO PROFOUND A SORROW THAT MY CURIOSITY INCREASED IN PROPORTION WITH MY ASTONISHMENT
SUPPOSE WE HAVE SUPPER THAT'S IT LET'S GO AND HAVE SUPPER SAID GASTON
A GREAT WHITE SHROUD COVERED THE CORPSE CLOSELY OUTLINING SOME OF ITS CONTOURS
I HAVE COME BECAUSE I HAD NO TIME TO ANSWER YOU DURING THE DAY AND I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU THINK THAT I WAS ANGRY WITH YOU
YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST
WHEN I REACHED THE RUE D'ANTIN THE GREAT CITY STIRRED A LITTLE BEFORE QUITE AWAKENING
HE STILL DOES
DUVERNOY
DUVERNOY
MEANWHILE YOUR MISTRESS WILL CONSOLE HERSELF
MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C
I NEVER KNEW THE BODY COULD SUFFER SO
I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER
I FELT SURE THAT AN ANSWER WOULD COME AND I RESOLVED NOT TO GO OUT ALL DAY
IT WOULD NEVER DO FOR HER TO QUARREL WITH THE COUNT WHO IS WORTH TO HER AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR
THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE
WHILE HE WAS ADMIRING THE VIEW I ASKED MME
I GIVE WAY SIR NOTHING MORE BEING OFFERED THE BOOK WAS ASSIGNED TO ME
YOUR MOTHER WHEN SHE DIED LEFT YOU ENOUGH TO LIVE ON RESPECTABLY AND NOT TO SQUANDER ON YOUR MISTRESSES I SWEAR TO YOU FATHER THAT MARGUERITE KNEW NOTHING OF THIS TRANSFER WHY THEN DO YOU MAKE IT BECAUSE MARGUERITE THE WOMAN YOU CALUMNIATE AND WHOM YOU WISH ME TO ABANDON IS SACRIFICING ALL THAT SHE POSSESSES IN ORDER TO LIVE WITH ME AND YOU ACCEPT THIS SACRIFICE
SHE IS ASLEEP IN YOUR ROOM WAITING TILL YOU ARE READY TO GO TO BED REPLIED PRUDENCE
THEN ALL WAS SILENT AND SHE FELL BACK ON THE BED EXHAUSTED
DON'T WAIT TILL YOU ARE RUINED ESPECIALLY AS THE COMTE DE N
AND IN SHORT I AM NOT IN A POSITION WHICH AUTHORIZES A FATHER TO SAY TO HIS SON WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID TO ME A FATHER IS ALWAYS AUTHORIZED TO RESCUE HIS SON OUT OF EVIL PATHS
HALF AN HOUR LATER WE WERE AT MONTMARTRE
SEE HOW MUCH NOTICE THE OTHERS TAKE OF ME
LOUISE RAN TO TELL THE GOOD NEWS TO HER MOTHER
IF MARGUERITE HAD BEEN GOING TO ANSWER ME SHE WOULD HAVE ANSWERED LONG BEFORE
HAS GIVEN HER
AT LAST CRIED MARGUERITE COMING BACK HE HAS GONE
ONE MORNING THE DUKE WHO HAD REMAINED AT BAGNERES TO BE NEAR THE SOIL THAT HAD BURIED A PART OF HIS HEART CAUGHT SIGHT OF MARGUERITE AT A TURN OF THE ROAD
HE WROTE AND ASKED THAT HE MIGHT SEE HER AGAIN AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS
BELIEVE ME THEN MY FRIEND TAKE THINGS FOR WHAT THEY ARE WORTH AND DO NOT GIVE A KEPT WOMAN THE RIGHT TO CALL HERSELF YOUR CREDITOR NO MATTER IN WHAT IT WAS WELL ARGUED WITH A LOGIC OF WHICH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT PRUDENCE INCAPABLE
I HAVE INTRUSTED HIM WITH A COMMISSION THE RESULT OF WHICH I AWAIT IMPATIENTLY
WHAT YOU PROPOSED TO ME JUST NOW MADE ME FRANTIC WITH DELIGHT BUT THE MYSTERY IN ITS CARRYING OUT HURTS ME DREADFULLY COME LET US REASON IT OUT SHE SAID TAKING BOTH MY HANDS AND LOOKING AT ME WITH A CHARMING SMILE WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST YOU LOVE ME DO YOU NOT
WE ENTERED
MEETING ONE DAY A MAN WHO WAS CONSTANTLY ABOUT WITH KNOWN WOMEN I ASKED HIM
I NEVER MET ANY ONE LIKE YOU THAT IS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS EVER LOVED YOU AS I LOVE YOU FRANKLY THEN YOU REALLY LOVE ME AS MUCH AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOVE I THINK AND THAT HAS LASTED SINCE SINCE THE DAY I SAW YOU GO INTO SUSSE'S THREE YEARS AGO
YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY
WELL I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU A HUNDRED TIMES NO
WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS AND UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE TREES WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE
WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF-ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
WHO TOLD YOU THAT I WAS HANDING THIS SUM TO HER I ASKED
I WENT UP TO THE INSPECTOR
WHAT IS THE MATTER I MUST SEEM VERY SILLY TO YOU BUT I AM FRIGHTFULLY TROUBLED BY WHAT I HAVE JUST SEEN YOU ARE VERY GOOD
IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARMAND DO NOT DRIVE ME BACK INTO THE LIFE I HAD TO LEAD ONCE I COULD NOT ANSWER
THE PATERNAL WAY IN WHICH M
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK OF ME MADAME I HAVE ONLY TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR MY INDISCRETION AND TO TAKE LEAVE OF YOU WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT IT SHALL NOT OCCUR AGAIN THEREUPON I BOWED AND QUITTED THE BOX
BUT I HAD SO GREAT A DESIRE TO SEE HER BEFORE THE EVENING THAT I WENT TO THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES WHERE I AGAIN SAW HER PASS AND REPASS AS I HAD ON THE PREVIOUS DAY
DE G
DE G
DE G
DE G
DE G
DE G
DE G
A CARRIAGE WAS GOING AT FULL GALLOP TOWARD BOUGIVAL
I HAVE A DAUGHTER AS I HAVE TOLD YOU YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PURE AS AN ANGEL
BUT I AM ONE OF THOSE WITH WHOM EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THE WAY IN WHICH ONE BREAKS WITH THEM
I LIFTED THE CURTAIN OF MY WINDOW AND SAW HIM GET INTO THE CABRIOLET WHICH AWAITED HIM AT THE DOOR
DO NOT SPEAK OF THAT ARMAND
WOULD YOU CLOSE THE WINDOW FOR ME HE SAID
HER THIN ARMS OPENED FROM TIME TO TIME TO HOLD ME FAST AND FELL BACK HELPLESSLY UPON THE BED
WHEN THE COFFIN WAS UNCOVERED THE INSPECTOR SAID TO THE GRAVE-DIGGER
THAT IS ALL THE PAST UP TO YESTERDAY
IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN ONCE WHAT I KNOW NOW
THE DAY WHEN MARGUERITE AND I CAME TO PARIS TO LOOK FOR A FLAT I WENT TO THIS SOLICITOR AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO MAKE OVER THIS INCOME TO ANOTHER PERSON
YES MY FRIEND I AM ILL AND WITH ONE OF THOSE DISEASES THAT NEVER RELENT
I REPEAT TO YOU TO-DAY FOR THE LAST TIME I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU
WHATEVER MAY BE YOUR RESOLUTION OF LIVING OTHERWISE THAN AS YOU HAVE LIVED ARMAND WHO LOVES YOU WILL NEVER CONSENT TO THE SECLUSION TO WHICH HIS MODEST FORTUNE WOULD CONDEMN YOU AND TO WHICH YOUR BEAUTY DOES NOT ENTITLE YOU
THE BAD WEATHER HAS RETURNED
DURING THE SIX MONTHS THAT HE HAS KNOWN YOU ARMAND HAS FORGOTTEN ME
I GAVE MY SERVANT MY ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY TELLING HIM TO BRING ME THE FIRST LETTER THAT CAME WITH THE POSTMARK OF C THEN I RETURNED TO BOUGIVAL
O VANITY OF MAN COMING BACK TO US IN EVERY FORM
BELIEVE ME MADAME YOURS MOST FAITHFULLY THIS IS THE LETTER HE SENT ME
THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE I TOOK MARGUERITE'S HEAD IN MY HANDS
THAT IS THE ONLY CREATURE I EVER LOVED
WHAT I TELL YOU IS A TRUE AND SIMPLE STORY AND I LEAVE TO IT ALL THE NAIVETE OF ITS DETAILS AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS
ABOUT MIDNIGHT A CARRIAGE THAT I KNEW WELL STOPPED BEFORE NO
NEXT DAY I CALLED AT 9 RUE D'ANTIN
ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT SORT OF LOVE MEANS THERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN
SHE ENTERS AN HONOURABLE FAMILY WHICH REQUIRES THAT MINE HAS TO BE NO LESS HONOURABLE
WHERE IS MADAME GONE TO PARIS REPLIED NANINE
THE EMPTY BED SEEMED AT MOMENTS TO ASSUME THE ASPECT OF A TOMB
I WANTED SHE CONTINUED TO ARRANGE EVERYTHING WITHOUT TELLING YOU PAY ALL MY DEBTS AND TAKE A NEW FLAT
THIS IS WHAT I READ
DUVERNOY WHO SEEMED ALMOST AS PREOCCUPIED AS MARGUERITE AND WENT ON TO MY FATHER'S
HIS MANNER AT FIRST WAS SO STIFF INSOLENT AND EVEN THREATENING THAT I HAD TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS IN MY OWN HOUSE AND THAT I HAD NO NEED TO RENDER HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY LIFE EXCEPT BECAUSE OF THE SINCERE AFFECTION WHICH I HAD FOR HIS SON
NEVER DID A MARTYR SUFFER SUCH TORTURE TO JUDGE BY THE CRIES SHE UTTERED
I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING
THREE MONTHS AFTERWARD A MAN TOOK PITY ON HER AND TRIED TO HEAL HER MORALLY AND PHYSICALLY
I ONLY WENT OUT TO HAVE A HASTY DINNER AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING NO REPLY HAD COME
YOU COUNT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT SAID SHE TURNING TOWARD M
DUVERNOY IS IN THE SECRET YES MY CHILDREN SAID SHE
I REMEMBER HOWEVER THE CONTEMPT AND DISGUST WHICH AWOKE IN ME AT THE SIGHT OF THIS SCANDALOUS CHAPERONING
I WAS STILL MORE AGITATED THAN ON THE EVENING WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED IN THE BOX AT THE OPERA COMIQUE
I HEARD THAT YOUR FATHER HAD TAKEN YOU AWAY WITH HIM BUT I FELT SURE THAT YOU COULD NOT LIVE AWAY FROM ME FOR LONG AND WHEN I MET YOU IN THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES I WAS A LITTLE UPSET BUT BY NO MEANS SURPRISED
COME NOW LET US GO I TOOK HER HAND RAISED IT TO MY LIPS AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF TWO TEARS FELL UPON IT
I WANT TO WEEP HIS CHEST LABOURED HIS EYES WERE INJECTED WITH BLOOD BUT NO TEARS CAME
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HER INTUITIVELY
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT MY FATHER WAS IN THE SAME CITY THAT I MIGHT BE WITH HIM IN TEN MINUTES AND THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE CAUSE OF MY SORROW HE WOULD SHARE IT
BECAUSE YOU WEPT
IF ANY ONE HAD SAID TO ME YOU SHALL HAVE THIS WOMAN TO-NIGHT AND BE KILLED TOMORROW I WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
I OFTEN CAME TO INQUIRE AFTER YOU AND I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR OF YOUR CONVALESCENCE THEY NEVER GAVE ME YOUR CARD I DID NOT LEAVE IT WAS IT YOU THEN WHO CALLED EVERY DAY WHILE I WAS ILL AND WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOUR NAME YES IT WAS I THEN YOU ARE MORE THAN INDULGENT YOU ARE GENEROUS
I COULD SEE HER THROUGH THE SHOP WINDOWS SELECTING WHAT SHE HAD COME TO BUY
YOU DON'T DECEIVE A WOMAN LIKE ME MY DEAR FRIEND
THE PROOF OF DISINTERESTEDNESS THAT SHE GAVE IN NOT ACCEPTING A RICH AND FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN READY TO WASTE ALL HIS MONEY UPON HER EXCUSED HER IN MY EYES FOR ALL HER FAULTS IN THE PAST
YOUR FATHER EMBRACED ME ONCE MORE
NO ONE
SHE DID NOT WISH TO TELL ME BEFOREHAND FOR SHE KNEW THAT THOUGH I HAD CONSENTED TO IT THE SALE SO NECESSARY TO OUR FUTURE HAPPINESS WAS PAINFUL TO ME AND SHE FEARED TO WOUND MY SELF-RESPECT IN SPEAKING TO ME ABOUT IT
ADMIT THAT MARGUERITE LOVES YOU ENOUGH TO GIVE UP THE COUNT OR THE DUKE IN CASE ONE OF THEM WERE TO DISCOVER YOUR LIAISON AND TO TELL HER TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIM AND YOU THE SACRIFICE THAT SHE WOULD MAKE FOR YOU WOULD BE ENORMOUS YOU CAN NOT DENY IT
ALL THE SAME MY HEART BEGAN TO BEAT WHEN I KNEW THAT IT WAS SHE
THE DINING-ROOM IS FULL OF SWEETS AND ALL SORTS OF PRESENTS THAT MY FRIENDS HAVE BROUGHT
BE GOOD BE YOUNG BE TRUE
HOW STRONG HE FEELS WITH HIS CRUEL RIGHT TO SAY
IS A FOOL AND NOTHING WOULD PREVENT YOUR STILL BEING MARGUERITE'S LOVER
HER REST WAS OF SHORT DURATION FOR TOWARD ELEVEN SHE AWOKE AND SEEING THAT I WAS UP SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER CRYING
SEE TAKE MY HAND
WHEN I PUT MY LIPS TO HER FOREHEAD SHE STARTED AS IF THE KISS HAD SUDDENLY AWAKENED HER
WE HELD EACH OTHER'S HANDS AND FOR A WHOLE QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE HAD NOT SPOKEN WHEN MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
DOUBTLESS MARGUERITE PERCEIVED THE IMPRESSION MADE ON ME BY THE PRESENCE OF THIS MAN FOR SHE SMILED TO ME AGAIN AND TURNING HER BACK TO THE COUNT APPEARED TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE TO THE PLAY
DON'T SING THOSE BEASTLY THINGS I SAID TO MARGUERITE IMPLORINGLY
IF YOU KNEW MARGUERITE YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT I AM IN NO DANGER
SEND FOR SOME SUPPER WHAT MUST I GET WHATEVER YOU LIKE BUT AT ONCE AT ONCE NANINE WENT OUT
I HAD NO DOUBT FROM THE WAY IN WHICH MARGUERITE CAME TO MEET HER THAT ANOTHER SIMILAR CONVERSATION WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
NOW THAT ALL IS IRREVOCABLY ENDED THEY A RISE NATURALLY OUT OF WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE
WHAT SORT OF A MAN ARE YOU SIR TO ALLOW MLLE
TAKE MY KEY AND TRY NOT TO LOSE IT AGAIN I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN ELEVEN TWELVE
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO STUDIES THE OCCULT SCIENCES AND HE WOULD CALL WHAT I EXPERIENCED THE AFFINITY OF FLUIDS
I SUFFER HORRIBLY
THE SIGHT OF PARIS RESTORED MY STRENGTH AND I RAN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ALLEY I HAD SO OFTEN WALKED
WITH ANYBODY WHERE DOES SHE LIVE RUE TRONCLIET NO DO YOU WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO HER ONE NEVER KNOWS AND MARGUERITE I SHOULD HARDLY TELL YOU THE TRUTH IF I SAID I THINK NO MORE ABOUT HER
I PRETEND TO BELIEVE THEM
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO MME
HE WAS OBLIGED TO DISAPPEAR WHY BECAUSE HE WAS ALL BUT RUINED
WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD-HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY
I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE OLD MAN STILL KEEPS ALIVE
COME AND I WILL SHOW YOU AS YOU KNOW THE DRAWING-ROOM WAS A MARVEL
I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
I WAS INTERESTED IN THE YOUNG MAN IN SPITE OF MYSELF
9 RUE D'ANTIN
I BEGAN BY DANCING WITH HER
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ONLY A DISASTER COULD COME AT THAT HOUR AND UNDER THAT SOMBRE SKY
MARGUERITE ATE HER RAISINS GLACES WITHOUT TAKING ANY MORE NOTICE OF ME
ALL THAT IS VERY PRETTY VERY POETICAL BUT ONE CAN'T PAY ONE'S CREDITORS IN THAT COIN AND NOW SHE CAN'T FREE HERSELF FROM DEBT UNLESS SHE CAN RAISE THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS ALL RIGHT I WILL PROVIDE THAT AMOUNT YOU WILL BORROW IT GOOD HEAVENS
WHY YES A FINE THING THAT WILL BE TO DO
WHO WOULD THINK THAT A KEPT WOMAN COULD HAVE WRITTEN THAT AND OVERCOME BY RECOLLECTIONS HE GAZED FOR SOME TIME AT THE WRITING OF THE LETTER WHICH HE FINALLY CARRIED TO HIS LIPS
DO NOT LET US LIMIT ESTEEM TO THE FAMILY NOR INDULGENCE TO EGOISM
THE PRICE OF A SINGLE VOLUME IN A SALE OF THAT KIND IS A MERE NOTHING AND I DO NOT REMEMBER HOW MUCH I GAVE FOR IT YOU GAVE ONE HUNDRED FRANCS TRUE I SAID EMBARRASSED IN MY TURN HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS QUITE SIMPLE
HIS MISTRESS HAS BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO HIM
THIS MORNING M
TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT
THE OWNER'S NAME WAS NOT MENTIONED BUT THE SALE WAS TO BE HELD AT 9 RUE D'ANTIN ON THE 16TH FROM 12 TO 5
WILL YOU KINDLY RECEIVE HIM
WHY DID YOU BRING PRUDENCE I ASKED HER
I AM STIFLING
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD HER INSULT AND MY ABSURDITY TO WIPE OUT
EACH OF THEM BROUGHT ME A FRESH INSULT FROM YOU
AM I NOT HERE
HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM PRECISELY AND YOU DO ONE HAS TO
LET HIM KEEP HIS MONEY
FOR IN SPITE OF THE HALF-MOCKING SMILES WITH WHICH SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED THE WHOLE CONVERSATION IT SEEMED TO ME THAT MARGUERITE BEGAN TO SHARE MY AGITATION AND THAT THE HOUR SO LONG AWAITED WAS DRAWING NEAR
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HERE AND THERE THE PAGES WERE WET AS IF WITH TEARS
AND THUS THE SORT OF COMPARISON BETWEEN HER AND MARGUERITE GAVE ME AN UNUSUAL INCLINATION TO READ IT AND MY INDULGENCE PASSED INTO PITY ALMOST INTO A KIND OF LOVE FOR THE POOR GIRL TO WHOM I OWED THE VOLUME
WELL FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DO NOT LIVE AS YOU ARE LIVING NOW IF I TOOK CARE OF MYSELF I SHOULD DIE
SIR SAID HE YOUR FATHER HAS ARRIVED IN PARIS AND BEGS YOU TO RETURN AT ONCE TO YOUR ROOMS WHERE HE IS WAITING FOR YOU THIS PIECE OF NEWS WAS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD YET AS WE HEARD IT MARGUERITE AND I LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER
MADEMOISELLE MARGUERITE GAUTIER HE REPLIED
I COST YOU ENOUGH ALREADY HERE YOU REPROACH ME MARGUERITE
COME LET US GO BACK TO SUPPER
TO THAT SUCCEEDED A BRIEF SLEEP FOR DISAPPEARING INTO THE DEPTHS OF OUR LOVE WE WERE LIKE TWO DIVERS WHO ONLY COME TO THE SURFACE TO TAKE BREATH
I WAS HALF DEAD WHEN THEY BROUGHT ME HOME
I OPENED THE DOORS ONE AFTER ANOTHER
SHE WILL FORGET YOU YOU WILL FORGET HER AND NEITHER WILL HAVE ANY REPROACH TO MAKE AGAINST THE OTHER BUT IF I WRITE AND ASK HER FORGIVENESS DON'T DO THAT FOR SHE WOULD FORGIVE YOU I COULD HAVE FLUNG MY ARMS ROUND PRUDENCE'S NECK
SHE WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE
VERY WELL WHAT SORT OF A GIRL WAS SHE A FINE GOOD GIRL
AND WHY THIS PROPOSITION BECAUSE I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU OF COURSE NO BUT BECAUSE YOU LOVE MARGUERITE AND YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR REVENGE UPON HER BY BECOMING MY LOVER
SHE DID NOT SPEAK A WORD
THEN MY TEARS AGAIN BEGAN TO FLOW
ALL THESE HABITS ARE SO MUCH A PART OF HIS POSITION THAT HE CAN NOT FOREGO THEM WITHOUT APPEARING TO HAVE LOST ALL HIS MONEY AND WITHOUT CAUSING SCANDAL
DANCED SANG AMUSED HERSELF WITH CALLING UP PICTURES OF HER NEW FLAT IN ALL ITS SIMPLICITY AND BEGAN TO CONSULT ME AS TO ITS POSITION AND ARRANGEMENT
DUVERNOY'S
I DREAMED OF MARGUERITE
AT EVERY MOMENT WE AWAITED SOME EVENT BUT THE DAY PASSED WITHOUT BRINGING US ANY NEW TIDINGS
WHAT COULD THE PERSON WHO HAD GIVEN THE BOOK TO MARGUERITE WANT OF ME
THERE WAS NOTHING LACKING
PERHAPS SHE WAS INJURED ILL DEAD
MARGUERITE GAUTIER THE LAST TWO WORDS WERE SCARCELY LEGIBLE
I TOLD MY FATHER I SHOULD LIKE TO ACCOMPANY HIM
MARGUERITE FELL INTO HER LAST AGONY AT ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK
NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU AND TO WHOM MARGUERITE WAS AFTERWARD TO GIVE THE TOUCHING NARRATIVE THAT I HAVE THERE
I HAD A FIRE LIT IN MY ROOM AND I TOLD JOSEPH HE COULD GO OUT
I OWE YOU THE ONLY HAPPY MOMENTS IN MY LIFE
CHAPTER 18 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS OF OUR NEW LIFE
HER OPERA-GLASS A BAG OF SWEETS AND A BOUQUET OF CAMELLIAS
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY UNKIND TO ME ARMAND AND I HAVE DONE NOTHING TO YOU NOTHING I ANSWERED WITH A BITTER SMILE
SHE WAS LIKE A FIGURE OF RESIGNATION
THE MOTHER STILL LIVES
JUST AS MARGUERITE WAS GOING TO RING I WENT UP TO HER AND SAID GOOD-EVENING AH IT IS YOU SHE SAID IN A TONE THAT BY NO MEANS REASSURED ME AS TO HER PLEASURE IN SEEING ME
SHE IS A CHARMING MISTRESS AND IT ISN'T EVERYBODY WHO HAS THE CHANCE
I DID NOT KNOW BUT IF THAT HAD BEEN HER INTENTION SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED FOR WHEN SHE APPEARED ALL HEADS TURNED AND THE ACTOR WHO WAS THEN ON THE STAGE LOOKED TO SEE WHO HAD PRODUCED SUCH AN EFFECT ON THE AUDIENCE BY HER MERE PRESENCE THERE
THE POOR GIRL TURNED CRIMSON CLOSED HER EYES UNDER THE PAIN AND PUT HER NAPKIN TO HER LIPS
AT FIRST I BEGAN TO RUN BUT THE EARTH WAS MUDDY WITH RAIN AND I FATIGUED MYSELF DOUBLY
ALL THE SAME I RANG
MY FATHER GAVE ME DRAFTS AND LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION AND EIGHT OR TEN DAYS AFTERWARD I EMBARKED AT MARSEILLES
IN SHORT I LOVED YOU ARMAND
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER HER AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE BOULEVARDS ALMOST EVERY DAY AT THE SAME HOUR ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER AS ASSIDUOUSLY AS A REAL MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ACCOMPANIED HER DAUGHTER
I COPY IT WITHOUT ADDING OR OMITTING A SYLLABLE
WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF THE WORD HUMILITY
I WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE STREET
I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE NOTICED IF ONCE THE NAME OF ANYBODY WHO MIGHT IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS HAVE ALWAYS REMAINED UNKNOWN OR AT ALL EVENTS INDIFFERENT TO YOU SHOULD BE MENTIONED BEFORE YOU IMMEDIATELY DETAILS BEGIN TO GROUP THEMSELVES ABOUT THE NAME AND YOU FIND ALL YOUR FRIENDS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE
MANY OF MARGUERITE'S FRIENDS CAME TO THE CHURCH
WHY DO WE MAKE OURSELVES MORE STRICT THAN CHRIST
SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS MUCH AS TO SAY
AND NOW GO BACK NICELY TO YOUR PLACE AND ABOVE ALL NO MORE JEALOUSY SHE KISSED ME AGAIN AND I LEFT THE BOX
DESPITE THE BURNING FEVER WHICH DEVOURED ME I MADE THEM DRESS ME AND TAKE ME TO THE VAUDEVILLE
CHAPTER 21 AT LAST YOU HAVE COME SHE SAID THROWING HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK
I MIGHT INDEED ASK MARGUERITE FOR THE TRUTH IN REGARD TO THESE DISAPPEARANCES BUT IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT CONFESS IT
WE WON'T GO TILL WE PLEASE WHY SHOULD WE GO I AM GOING OVER TO MARGUERITE'S WE WILL WAIT HERE YOU CAN'T THEN WE WILL GO WITH YOU THAT STILL LESS I KNOW MARGUERITE SAID GASTON
BUT DON'T LOOK UPON IT AS A LOST CHANCE
THE RESPECT OF THIS OLD MAN WHICH I WOULD GAIN
BUT IF I AM TO SAY IT TO YOU ONE DAY IT IS NOT TO-DAY YOU WILL DO BETTER NEVER TO SAY IT WHY BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS CAN COME OF IT WHAT EITHER I SHALL NOT ACCEPT
GAUTIER AT FIVE IN THE MORNING
FOR THE MOMENT I WANT YOU TO DO ME A SERVICE WHAT IS IT YOUR CAB IS BELOW YES
YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH YET IT IS A WARM EVENING I HAVE EATEN MY RATION OF CHICKEN HE SAID TO ME SMILING
I HAVE SIMPLY COME TO ASK OF YOU A GREAT SERVICE SPEAK ON SIR I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISPOSAL YOU WERE PRESENT AT THE SALE OF MARGUERITE GAUTIER AT THIS WORD THE EMOTION WHICH HE HAD GOT THE BETTER OF FOR AN INSTANT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO COVER HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND
NEVERTHELESS THIS HILARITY THIS WAY OF TALKING AND DRINKING WHICH SEEMED TO ME IN THE OTHERS THE MERE RESULTS OF BAD COMPANY OR OF BAD HABITS SEEMED IN MARGUERITE A NECESSITY OF FORGETTING A FEVER A NERVOUS IRRITABILITY
THE DUKE HAS NOT ANSWERED
THEN I WALKED SADLY AWAY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE RECEIPTS AND THE PAWN TICKETS AND PRUDENCE OPENED THE DRAWER AND SHOWED ME THE PAPERS
SHE CAN'T SLEEP BEFORE THAT WHY BECAUSE SHE SUFFERS IN THE CHEST AND IS ALMOST ALWAYS FEVERISH HASN'T SHE ANY LOVERS I ASKED
I HELD HER AND SAID TO HER
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE LOOKING AT ME AND SEEMING TO ASK HERSELF IF THIS WAS THE SAME MAN WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN SO MADLY IN LOVE
ARMAND LEANED AGAINST A TREE AND WATCHED
NOTHING BUT WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES FORCED ME TO DO I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER IN YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCED OR IF YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE WHAT I FELT AT THE SIGHT OF MARGUERITE
THE EVERLASTING REPENTANCE NOT OF THE EVIL WAYS FOLLOWED BUT OF THE PLANS THAT HAVE MISCARRIED THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN SPENT IN VAIN IS AS SADDENING A THING AS ONE CAN WELL MEET WITH
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE MELODY BROUGHT BACK THAT RECOLLECTION AND COMING UP TO HER I TOOK HER HEAD BETWEEN MY HANDS AND KISSED HER
OH COME COME ARMAND
EVER SINCE I HEARD OF HER DEATH ESPECIALLY SINCE I SAW HER GRAVE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP
THEIR DEATH WHEN THEY DIE YOUNG IS HEARD OF BY ALL THEIR LOVERS AT THE SAME MOMENT FOR IN PARIS ALMOST ALL THE LOVERS OF A WELL-KNOWN WOMAN ARE FRIENDS
AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT A MAN WHO IS NOT HEARTLESS HAS OTHER NOBLER THINGS TO DO THAN TO TAKE HIS REVENGE UPON A SICK AND SAD WOMAN LIKE ME
YOU WILL FIND IN IT THE REASON AND THE EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAS PASSED BETWEEN US
NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS
I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL BUT I WANTED TO HAVE IT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS MY BELOVED MARGUERITE
OUR DESTINIES ARE SEPARATE
I ROSE TO MY FEET SAYING IN AN ALTERED VOICE WHICH I COULD NOT ENTIRELY CONTROL
FIRST HER PROPOSAL TO SPEND THE SUMMER WITH ME IN THE COUNTRY THEN THE CERTAINTY THAT THERE WAS NO REASON WHY SHE SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS SINCE MY INCOME WAS INSUFFICIENT FOR HER NEEDS AND EVEN FOR HER CAPRICES
I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT I CONSENTED AND THAT I PUT INTO THE LETTER WHICH I SENT TO HER ADDRESS THE SAME DAY EVERYTHING BITTER SHAMEFUL AND CRUEL THAT I COULD THINK OF
THEN I BEGAN TO REGRET THE TERMS OF MY LETTER
I LEFT THE PALAIS ROYAL AND WENT TO ALL THE THEATRES WHERE SHE WAS MOST OFTEN TO BE SEEN
TO BE LOVED BY A PURE YOUNG GIRL TO BE THE FIRST TO REVEAL TO HER THE STRANGE MYSTERY OF LOVE IS INDEED A GREAT HAPPINESS BUT IT IS THE SIMPLEST THING IN THE WORLD
THE DUCHESS OF F
I AM BACK IN BED AGAIN COVERED WITH PLASTERS WHICH BURN ME
MARGUERITE WENT TOWARD HER BEDROOM
I WAS ON THE POINT OF CALLING ON PRUDENCE AND OF SENDING HER TO TELL MARGUERITE THAT I WANTED TO SPEAK TO HER
NEVER HAD I GONE TO A THEATRE SO EARLY
TO MLLE
THAT'S ALL THANKS
H
H
THAT NIGHT SHE WAS MARVELLOUSLY BEAUTIFUL
THAT SUCH CHILDREN ARE USELESS AND A LYING-IN IS SO MUCH TIME LOST
YOU ARE STILL GOOD AND I THANK GOD FOR IT
IF I WERE TO OFFER THE BODY THAT PEOPLE PAID SO DEAR FOR ONCE HOW MUCH WOULD THEY GIVE I WONDER TO-DAY
YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU DID ARMAND
DURING THE DAY I RECEIVED A NOTE CONTAINING THESE WORDS
IT IS YOU SHE SAID WITH A SMILE
I DO NOT KNOW IF SHE SAW MY EMOTION
I SOON TURNED THE CONVERSATION IN HER DIRECTION
COME GENTLEMEN SUPPER AND SLIPPING AWAY FROM GASTON MARGUERITE MADE HIM SIT ON HER RIGHT AT TABLE ME ON HER LEFT THEN CALLED TO NANINE
IF I HAD KILLED MYSELF IT WOULD HAVE BURDENED YOUR LIFE WHICH OUGHT TO BE HAPPY WITH A NEEDLESS REMORSE
SHALL WE HAVE LUNCH SHE WENT ON ABSENTMINDEDLY
IT WAS HE WHO BROUGHT HER OUT
SHE WAS THE VERY TYPE OF THE SHAMELESS HEARTLESS SENSELESS COURTESAN FOR ME AT LEAST FOR PERHAPS SOME MEN MIGHT HAVE DREAMED OF HER AS I DREAMED OF MARGUERITE
AND I HAD THE KEY OF THIS WOMAN'S ROOM AND IN THREE OR FOUR HOURS SHE WOULD AGAIN BE MINE
I TRIED TO WIN BACK THE DUKE BUT I HAD OFFENDED HIM TOO DEEPLY
WE WENT BACK JOYOUSLY TO BOUGIVAL TALKING OVER OUR PROJECTS FOR THE FUTURE WHICH THANKS TO OUR HEEDLESSNESS AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR LOVE WE SAW IN THE ROSIEST LIGHT
NO DOUBT DESPITE HER LOVE FOR ME THE POOR GIRL COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND TO GIVE UP ALL THE LUXURY IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED UNTIL NOW AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SO ENVIED WITHOUT CRYING OVER IT
AT LAST MME
IS THERE ANYTHING SADDER IN THE WORLD THAN THE OLD AGE OF VICE ESPECIALLY IN WOMAN
YOU ARE NOBLE AND THE MEMORY OF A GOOD DEED WILL REDEEM YOU FROM MANY PAST DEEDS
FROM THAT I WENT ON TO UNLIMITED HOPE UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE
TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT HE GAVE HER TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE HAS HAD HIS WAY AT LAST
I WENT OUT AGAIN AND THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE BOOK UNTIL AT NIGHT WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED
THE PRIEST ANOINTED WITH HOLY OIL THE FEET AND HANDS AND FOREHEAD OF THE DYING WOMAN REPEATED A SHORT PRAYER AND MARGUERITE WAS READY TO SET OUT FOR THE HEAVEN TO WHICH I DOUBT NOT SHE WILL GO IF GOD HAS SEEN THE ORDEAL OF HER LIFE AND THE SANCTITY OF HER DEATH
THE HALF HOUR SOUNDED SADLY FROM THE CHURCH TOWER
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING TO BE FOUND OUT OR AT LEAST THAT MY SUSPICIONS WERE ABOUT TO BE CONFIRMED
I CAME TO SEE YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CHARMING TO ME AND I KNEW YOU BEFORE I EVER KNEW MARGUERITE
BUT I SUCCEEDED IN GIVING A COLD EXPRESSION TO MY FACE AS I BOWED COLDLY TO MY FORMER MISTRESS WHO JUST THEN REACHED HER CARRIAGE INTO WHICH SHE GOT WITH HER FRIEND
HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO GIVE JUST ENOUGH IMPORTANCE TO MAKING LOVE TO WOMEN LIKE ME FOR IT TO BE AN AGREEABLE PASTIME AND WHO ARE THUS ABLE TO REMAIN FRIENDS WITH WOMEN NOT HATING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN JEALOUS OF THEM AND HE IS TOO ONE OF THOSE GRAND SEIGNEURS WHO OPEN ONLY A PART OF THEIR HEARTS TO US BUT THE WHOLE OF THEIR PURSES
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO FOR YOU DO YOU KNOW M
AND ON THE VERY SECOND DAY I HAD DESTROYED THIS HOPE AND PAID BY IMPERTINENT IRONY FOR THE LOVE WHICH I HAD ACCEPTED DURING TWO NIGHTS
THE YOUNG MAN RETURNED TO HIS FRIENDS THE HORSES SET OUT AGAIN AND AS I CAME NEAR THE GROUP I RECOGNISED THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO MARGUERITE AS THE COMTE DE G WHOSE PORTRAIT I HAD SEEN AND WHOM PRUDENCE HAD INDICATED TO ME AS THE MAN TO WHOM MARGUERITE OWED HER POSITION
YOU OVERWHELM HIM TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE CAN NOT FIND A WORD TO SAY I SHOULD SAY ON THE CONTRARY THAT HE HAS ONLY COME WITH YOU BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BORED YOU TO COME HERE BY YOURSELF IF THAT WERE TRUE I SAID I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEGGED ERNEST TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION TO INTRODUCE ME PERHAPS THAT WAS ONLY IN ORDER TO PUT OFF THE FATAL MOMENT HOWEVER LITTLE ONE MAY HAVE KNOWN WOMEN LIKE MARGUERITE ONE CAN NOT BUT KNOW THE DELIGHT THEY TAKE IN PRETENDING TO BE WITTY AND IN TEASING THE PEOPLE WHOM THEY MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME
THEN SHE CALLED GASTON AND WENT INTO THE DINING-ROOM WITH HIM TO SEE IF SUPPER WAS READY
DUVAL RETURNED TO HIS CARRIAGE AND SET OUT FOR PARIS
OH WITH ALL MY HEART FRIEND FOR THE WAY YOU HURT ME WAS ONLY A WAY OF PROVING THE LOVE YOU HAD FOR ME
I DID NOT SLEEP ON THE WAY TO PARIS
NANINE ENTERED A MOMENT AFTER
PRESENTLY I SAW HER GLANCING ACROSS AT THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE OPPOSITE BOX
AT ONE IN THE MORNING MARGUERITE GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE WITH HER THREE FRIENDS
I AM NOT VERY WELL AND THE DOCTOR HAS ORDERED QUIET
IT HAPPENS TO HER EVERY DAY
IT WAS OLYMPE
BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE REASON OF HER CONSENT ONE THING WAS CERTAIN SHE HAD CONSENTED
SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT IT IS MUCH MORE SIMPLE IT IS POSSIBLE
DO YOU KNOW HIM NO
WELL FATHER I CAN PROMISE NOTHING I SAID AT LAST
AND WHEN YOU SEE WHAT IT IS FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALL BUT BROKEN WITH YOUR FATHER AND ALL BUT LOST HIS LOVE YOU WILL TELL ME THAT I HAVE DONE WELL TO COME AND SEEK YOU OUT AND YOU WILL THANK ME FOR IT
LET ME UNDECEIVE THOSE WHO THINK THUS AND LET THEM GO ON READING IF NOTHING BUT SUCH A FEAR HINDERS THEM
PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED THE COUNTRY WITH LOVE AND THEY HAVE DONE WELL
I WENT TOWARD THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
AND TO REPENT IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE OF LIVING WITH ME
WHAT REMAINS OF MY POOR EXISTENCE IS SHARED BETWEEN BEING DELIRIOUS AND COUGHING
IT IS A SAD LIFE THAT I AM LEAVING
YOU ARE WATCHING THE TIME SAID MY FATHER AND YOU ARE IMPATIENT TO LEAVE ME
COME SHE SAID
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY TELL YOU WHAT THEY WERE ACTING
IT WAS I WHO WAS MISCHIEVOUS AS I STILL AM BUT SOMEWHAT LESS
DURING THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS ILLNESS I HAD HARDLY LEFT HIS SIDE
YES MADAME IN ONE MOMENT APROPOS SAID PRUDENCE TO ME YOU HAVE NOT LOOKED ROUND
WITH US IT IS AT ONCE OR NEVER
WILL MY ANSWER REACH YOU IN TIME
HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EYES WERE CONSTANTLY FIXED ON THE CLOCK
DUVERNOY'S SHE HAS NOT COME BACK YOU ARE SURE YES SIR
I PUT MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND MADE OVER TO MARGUERITE THE INCOME WHICH HAD COME TO ME FROM MY MOTHER AND WHICH SEEMED LITTLE ENOUGH IN RETURN FOR THE SACRIFICE WHICH I WAS ACCEPTING
MY SOUL SEEMED TO HAVE PASSED INTO MY HEART AND MY HEART INTO MY EYES
HE WAS JUST ABLE TO LET HIMSELF BE LED ALONG
UNLUCKILY I AM STILL TOO YOUNG AND TOO GOOD-LOOKING TO ACCEPT THE PART THAT YOU OFFER ME SO YOU REFUSE YES
I DID NOT MAKE THESE REFLECTIONS ON THE MORNING WHEN I RETURNED HOME
I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT YOU ARE ILL
TAKE THE LITTLE GILT KEY ON THE MANTELPIECE OPEN THAT DOOR
I PROMISED ALL THAT HE ASKED FOR I WAS INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINING A DISCUSSION AND I NEEDED SOME AFFECTION TO HELP ME TO LIVE AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED
I LET MY THOUGHT WANDER OVER THE SOLITARY PLAINS AND FROM TIME TO TIME I HEARD SOME ONE CALL TO ME AND POINT TO A HARE NOT TEN PACES OFF
AT FIRST MARGUERITE COULD NOT BREAK ENTIRELY WITH HER FORMER HABITS AND AS THE HOUSE WAS ALWAYS EN FETE ALL THE WOMEN WHOM SHE KNEW CAME TO SEE HER
I SAID TO MYSELF ALL THAT YOUR FATHER DARED NOT SAY TO ME THOUGH IT HAD COME TO HIS LIPS TWENTY TIMES
I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT I DON'T YET KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD I SHOWED MARGUERITE MY FATHER'S LETTERS
OLYMPE AND SHE GAVE UP SEEING ONE ANOTHER AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE
DE RANCE AFTER HAVING SEEN I WILL SEE I UNDERSTAND I SAID TO ARMAND AND I AM AT YOUR SERVICE
BUT HE ONLY PRESSED MY HAND AND LEFT ME HURRIEDLY SAYING
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO THE PORTER AND ASKED HIM IF MLLE
I WOULD HAVE CONSENTED TO ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LATTER
HE UNDERSTOOD THE LOOK AND SMILED AT ME
I COULD NOT SLEEP AND I HAVE A FRIGHTFUL HEADACHE SHALL I GO AWAY AND LET YOU GO TO BED OH YOU CAN STAY
TWO OR THREE MONTHS AND THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE TO LIVE THE LIFE I PROPOSE FOR THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE EVERYTHING FROM ME AND THAT IS WHAT A MAN OF HONOUR CAN NOT DO
THEY HAVE LONG KNOWN THE WORDS THAT WE SAY TO THEM THE MEANS WE USE
THERE WAS A NEW PORTER
HE TURNS HIS HEAD CROSSES THE STREET AND GOES SADLY BACK TO HIS OWN HOUSE
ONE THINKS SUCH LETTERS ONE DOES NOT WRITE THEM IN WHAT TONE DID SHE SAY THAT LAUGHINGLY AND SHE ADDED
I SAW HOW HAPPY AND PROUD SHE WAS OF THIS RESOLUTION WHICH SEEMED AS IF IT WOULD BRING US INTO CLOSER AND CLOSER RELATIONSHIP AND I RESOLVED TO DO MY OWN SHARE
IN SHORT EVERYTHING THAT ONE COULD ASK ABOUT A MAN OF YOUR AGE
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT WHICH BROUGHT HER
THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD ME IN PARIS ANY LONGER NEITHER HATE NOR LOVE
THEN WHEN YOU ARE STRONG AGAIN YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LIFE YOU ARE LEADING IF YOU CHOOSE
BUT I AM MLLE
AND WHEN THE DOCTOR LET HER GET UP SHE BEGAN AGAIN AT THE RISK OF HER LIFE
FOR TWENTY-FIVE DAYS OF THE MONTH THE CAMELLIAS WERE WHITE AND FOR FIVE THEY WERE RED
I SAT BY THE SIDE OF OLYMPE AND PUT DOWN MY MONEY SO RECKLESSLY THAT SHE COULD NOT BUT NOTICE ME
THE ROOMS NOW EMPTIED OF ALL THEIR FURNITURE HAD BEEN TO LET FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS WHEN ONE MORNING THERE WAS A RING AT MY DOOR
BUT HER REBELLIOUS FINGERS ALWAYS CAME TO GRIEF OVER ONE OF THE NOTES
GASTON WAS THOROUGHLY AMUSED
I WAS AFRAID
DO YOU KNOW THAT IS TREMENDOUSLY FINE
SO SAID SHE ALL AT ONCE IT WAS YOU WHO CAME TO INQUIRE AFTER ME WHEN I WAS ILL YES DO YOU KNOW IT WAS QUITE SPLENDID OF YOU
MADAME
AND NOW DEAR LOVE YOU WILL COME TO MY SALE AND YOU WILL BUY SOMETHING FOR IF I PUT ASIDE THE LEAST THING FOR YOU THEY MIGHT ACCUSE YOU OF EMBEZZLING SEIZED GOODS
I REMEMBERED TOO MARGUERITE'S TEARS ALL DAY LONG WHICH MY FATHER'S KIND RECEPTION HAD RATHER PUT OUT OF MY MIND
JULIE DUPRAT WHO IS LOOKING AFTER ME LETS ME WRITE THESE FEW LINES TO YOU
DON'T REPROACH ME FOR IT
DECEMBER 20
HE WAS VERY FOND OF HER
DO YOU THINK THEN THAT I DID NOT SUFFER SAID I ON THAT NIGHT WHEN AFTER WAITING FOR YOU IN THE COUNTRY I CAME TO LOOK FOR YOU IN PARIS AND FOUND NOTHING BUT THE LETTER WHICH NEARLY DROVE ME MAD
HE HASTENED WITH ME
I HAVE NO FEVER WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO I WILL TELL IT TO YOU NOW SINCE YOU REALLY WISH IT I WILL LISTEN THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME AND I HAVE SCARCELY CHANGED A WORD OF THE TOUCHING STORY
IN THE LAST HE ALLOWED ME TO SEE THAT HE HAD HEARD OF MY CHANGE OF LIFE AND INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO COME AND SEE ME
BUT MY REPENTANCE WAS ONLY OF A MOMENT'S DURATION AND OLYMPE WHO HAD FINALLY PUT ASIDE ALL SELF-RESPECT AND DISCOVERED THAT BY ANNOYING MARGUERITE SHE COULD GET FROM ME WHATEVER SHE WANTED CONSTANTLY STIRRED UP MY RESENTMENT AGAINST HER AND INSULTED HER WHENEVER SHE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE COWARDLY PERSISTENCE OF A WOMAN LICENSED BY THE AUTHORITY OF A MAN
BEFORE SHE HAD SPOKEN A WORD I REPLIED TO HER THOUGHT AND TAKING HER HAND I SAID FEAR NOTHING COME BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHISPERED MARGUERITE EMBRACING ME
YOU ARE FORTUNATE SHE SAID IN BEING ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM PARIS IN THIS FINE WEATHER I LOOKED AT PRUDENCE ASKING MYSELF WHETHER SHE WAS LAUGHING AT ME BUT HER FACE WAS QUITE SERIOUS
ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING
GO BACK TO YOUR FATHER MY FRIEND AND TO YOUR SISTER AND THERE BY THE SIDE OF A PURE YOUNG GIRL IGNORANT OF ALL OUR MISERIES YOU WILL SOON FORGET WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH THAT LOST CREATURE WHO IS CALLED MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHOM YOU HAVE LOVED FOR AN INSTANT AND WHO OWES TO YOU THE ONLY HAPPY MOMENTS OF A LIFE WHICH SHE HOPES WILL NOT BE VERY LONG NOW WHEN I HAD READ THE LAST WORD I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GONE MAD
LET HIM COME IN I SAID
IT DEPENDED ONLY ON SHOWING ENOUGH MONEY TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION
THIS WOMAN WHO THOUGHT SHE COULD GET MORE MONEY OUT OF MARGUERITE AT WHOSE EXPENSE SHE WAS LIVING ALMOST COMPLETELY HAS CONTRACTED LIABILITIES WHICH SHE CAN NOT MEET AND SEEING THAT HER NEIGHBOUR IS NO LONGER OF USE TO HER SHE DOES NOT EVEN COME TO SEE HER
IN THE SPRING OF 1847 MARGUERITE WAS SO ILL THAT THE DOCTORS ORDERED HER TO TAKE THE WATERS AND SHE WENT TO BAGNERES
ONLY MEN ARE STRONG ENOUGH NOT TO FORGIVE
EVERY TIME THE DOOR OPENS HER EYES BRIGHTEN AND SHE THINKS YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN
YOU REMEMBER ARMAND HOW THE ARRIVAL OF YOUR FATHER SURPRISED US AT BOUGIVAL
AND AFTER ALL SHE ISN'T SO BADLY OFF FOR SHE HAS HER GRAVE TO HERSELF AND IF THERE IS ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERS HER HE MAKES UP FOR THE OTHERS
I HAD A SORT OF HOPE THAT I SHOULD KILL MYSELF BY ALL THESE EXCESSES AND I THINK IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE THIS HOPE IS REALIZED
DUVERNOY WHEN I WAS IN THE STREET I BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER
HE SEEMED PROUD OF BEING STILL ON HIS FEET WHILE I WHO AM STILL YOUNG WAS BROKEN DOWN BY SUFFERING
GAUTIER SEND ME HER COMTE DE N
THAT IF I DRIVE THE THOUGHT OF YOU OUT OF MY MIND IT ALWAYS COMES BACK
LE COMTE DE N
SAY TO YOURSELF THAT YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN MY BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU MARGUERITE WAS A WOMAN IN THE SAME POSITION AS OLYMPE AND YET I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DARED SAY TO HER THE FIRST TIME I MET HER WHAT I HAD SAID TO THE OTHER WOMAN
THAT WOMAN WAS AN ANGEL
I TRIED TO PUT ON A SMILING COUNTENANCE AND I WENT TO CALL ON PRUDENCE
I HAD FORGOTTEN THIS WORD UPSET ALL THE REFLECTIONS I HAD HAD DURING THE DAY
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT I AM VERY HUNGRY AND THAT THE SOONER YOU CONSENT THE SOONER WE SHALL HAVE SUPPER COME SAID MARGUERITE THERE IS ROOM FOR THE THREE OF US IN MY CARRIAGE BY THE WAY SHE ADDED TURNING TO ME NANINE WILL BE GONE TO BED
YES YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING
AND YOU WOULD GLADLY SPEND TWO OR THREE MONTHS ALONE WITH ME IN THE COUNTRY
WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
SHE IS DECEIVING ME
THAT IS IF WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU WILL STILL TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THE POOR GIRL WHOM YOU LOVED BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY
THE DOCTOR BLED HER AND HER VOICE HAS RETURNED TO HER A WHILE
THE YOUNG DUCHESS WAS IN THE LAST STAGE OF CONSUMPTION AND A FEW DAYS AFTER MARGUERITE'S ARRIVAL SHE DIED
I ASKED NANINE IF DURING MY ABSENCE HER MISTRESS HAD RECEIVED ANY LETTER OR VISIT WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE STATE IN WHICH I FOUND HER BUT NANINE REPLIED THAT NO ONE HAD CALLED AND NOTHING HAD BEEN SENT
IT WAS SMALL AND HER MOTHER AS MUSSET WOULD SAY SEEMED TO HAVE MADE IT SO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WITH CARE
SHE HAS NOT COME IN I WILL GO UP AND WAIT FOR HER THERE IS NO ONE THERE EVIDENTLY I COULD GET IN SINCE I HAD THE KEY BUT FEARING FOOLISH SCANDAL I WENT AWAY
LOOK AT THIS WATCH ON THE MANTEL-PIECE THAT HE GAVE YOU
THEN BEGAN THAT SERIES OF DAYS
SHE CAN NOT ENDURE HIM IF MARGUERITE WISHES TO SEE ME SHE KNOWS WHERE I LIVE
SOME AMONG THE DETAILS OF THIS CHAPTER DID NOT REACH ME UNTIL LATER BUT I WRITE THEM HERE SO AS NOT TO BE OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THEM WHEN THE STORY ITSELF HAS BEGUN
THE HAIR BLACK AS JET WAVING NATURALLY OR NOT WAS PARTED ON THE FOREHEAD IN TWO LARGE FOLDS AND DRAPED BACK OVER THE HEAD LEAVING IN SIGHT JUST THE TIP OF THE EARS IN WHICH THERE GLITTERED TWO DIAMONDS WORTH FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS EACH
UNLUCKILY I DID NOT KNOW HIS ADDRESS AND NO ONE AMONG THOSE WHOM I QUESTIONED COULD GIVE IT TO ME
MARGUERITE HE SAID YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF M
DE G PROSECUTED FOR HIS DEBTS HAS HAD TO RETURN TO LONDON
IF I HAD ONLY MET HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME LIKE THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE WRITTEN THE FOOLISH LETTER WHICH I HAD WRITTEN
I REFUSED OBSTINATELY TO SEE IN HER A WOMAN LIKE OTHER WOMEN AND WITH THE VANITY SO COMMON TO ALL MEN I WAS READY TO BELIEVE THAT SHE COULD NOT BUT SHARE THE ATTRACTION WHICH DREW ME TO HER
SHE NEVER GOES TO BED BEFORE TWO IN THE MORNING
IT WAS A STRANGE NIGHT
WE LOVE
YOU ARE GOING YES I HAD LEARNED ENOUGH
I THINK BETWEEN OURSELVES THAT HE IS ENCHANTED WITH A CAPRICE WHICH WILL KEEP ME OUT OF PARIS FOR A TIME AND SO SILENCE THE OBJECTIONS OF HIS FAMILY
I AM HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO HAND IT OVER TO YOU BUT SAID M
I LOVED MARGUERITE
ONLY DO NOT DO THESE WOMEN THE HONOUR OF TAKING THEM SERIOUSLY
YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION
I STILL WAITED A LITTLE
AND TO THE CONSTERNATION OF PRUDENCE AND NANINE WHO CALLED TO ME TO COME BACK I FOLLOWED MARGUERITE
IT IS TRUE SHE WENT ON
DO NOT BE UNKIND LET ME HAVE IT
GOD KNOWS
BUT WHO TOLD YOU OF MY JOURNEY AND OF MY REASON FOR TAKING IT THE GARDENER OF THE CEMETERY YOU HAVE SEEN THE TOMB I SCARCELY DARED REPLY FOR THE TONE IN WHICH THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN PROVED TO ME THAT THE SPEAKER WAS STILL POSSESSED BY THE EMOTION WHICH I HAD WITNESSED BEFORE AND THAT EVERY TIME HIS THOUGHTS OR SPEECH TRAVELLED BACK TO THAT MOURNFUL SUBJECT EMOTION WOULD STILL FOR A LONG TIME TO COME PROVE STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
THERE IS AS MUCH DISINTERESTEDNESS IN HER AS THERE IS CUPIDITY IN OTHERS ALL OF WHICH DOES NOT PREVENT HER FROM ACCEPTING THE WHOLE OF YOUR FORTUNE FOR THE SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH COME TO YOU FROM YOUR MOTHER AND WHICH YOU ARE GIVING HER ARE UNDERSTAND ME WELL YOUR WHOLE FORTUNE MY FATHER HAD PROBABLY KEPT THIS PERORATION AND THIS THREAT FOR THE LAST STROKE
AND NOW GENTLEMEN IT IS TIME TO GO TEN MINUTES AFTER GASTON AND I LEFT THE HOUSE
THIRTY THOUSAND FRANCS AND WHEN DOES SHE REQUIRE THIS SUM BEFORE THE END OF TWO MONTHS SHE SHALL HAVE IT PRUDENCE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS
WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME IF IT WON'T BE TROUBLING YOU TOO MUCH WHAT DID HER SISTER SAY ABOUT IT NOTHING
SOMETHING HOWEVER HAD OCCURRED SINCE THE DAY BEFORE SOMETHING WHICH TROUBLED ME THE MORE BECAUSE MARGUERITE CONCEALED IT FROM ME
YES MADAME IN THE CARRIAGE
HOWEVER YOU ARE RIGHT SHE HASN'T BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP
YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART YOU WANT SOME ONE TO LOVE YOU YOU ARE TOO YOUNG AND TOO SENSITIVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD LIKE MINE
HE STAYED A VERY SHORT TIME IN THE ROOM AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE SAID TO ME
THERE WERE NO MORE TEARS
MUCH SHALL BE FORGIVEN THEE BECAUSE THOU HAST LOVED MUCH A SUBLIMITY OF PARDON WHICH CAN ONLY HAVE CALLED FORTH A SUBLIME FAITH
AND THEREUPON HE WENT TO HIS ROOM AND FINISHED DRESSING
IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE MARGUERITE IN A MONTH A WEEK
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF CAMILLE LA DAME AUX CAMILIAS BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS FILS
THE DUKE OF Y WHO IN MADRID IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUINING HIMSELF IN PARIS AND IN PARIS TO BE RUINING HIMSELF IN MADRID AND WHO AS A MATTER OF FACT NEVER EVEN REACHES THE LIMIT OF HIS INCOME TALKED WITH MME
IT IS BETTER TO HAVE THAT DONE WHILE WE ARE HERE AND DON'T NEED A CARRIAGE THAN TO WAIT TILL WE GET BACK TO PARIS PRUDENCE CAME TWO DAYS AFTERWARD AND CONFIRMED WHAT MARGUERITE HAD SAID
YOU ARE FEVERISH I SAID TO HIM
GAUTIER
GAUTIER
I CAN DO NO MORE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY BUT WHILE THERE IS A BREATH OF LIFE IN ME I WILL BE THE SLAVE OF YOUR FANCIES
SOMETIMES SURPRISING IN THE MIDST OF MY SADNESS MY FATHER'S ANXIOUS SCRUTINY I PRESSED HIS HAND AS IF TO ASK HIM TACITLY TO FORGIVE ME FOR THE PAIN WHICH IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS GIVING HIM
I HAVE SUFFERED DEEPLY DURING THESE LAST THREE WEEKS BUT THAT IS NOTHING I THINK IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT I SUFFERED THAT NIGHT
I AM ALWAYS ILL
THE RIVER ALMOST WITHOUT CURRENT AT THAT SPOT UNROLLS ITSELF LIKE A LARGE WHITE WATERED RIBBON BETWEEN THE PLAIN OF THE GABILLONS AND THE ISLAND OF CROISSY LULLED ETERNALLY BY THE TREMBLING OF ITS HIGH POPLARS AND THE MURMUR OF ITS WILLOWS
WHY BECAUSE M
DUVERNOY WENT OUT
I FOLLOWED THE RUE DU MONT-BLANC CROSSED THE BOULEVARD WENT UP THE RUE LOUIS-LE-GRAND THE RUE DE PORT-MAHON AND THE RUE D'ANTIN
SHE IS THE DEAD BODY THAT I LIKE THE BEST
I HAD NOT EVEN PAID THE WOMAN THAT I MIGHT HAVE SOME RIGHT TO FIND FAULT WITH HER
YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE SCRUPLE FOR SUCH IT WAS
AH YOU THINK SHE CONTINUED WITH THE INSISTENCE OF A WOMAN WHO CAN SAY I WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL AH YOU THINK IT IS ENOUGH TO BE IN LOVE AND TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND LEAD A DREAMY PASTORAL LIFE
I SAW WHAT WAS COMING AS SOON AS THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE SHOULD HAVE ABATED AND THUS CEASED TO SUSTAIN HIM
THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT
IT WILL SEEM ABSURD TO MANY PEOPLE BUT I HAVE AN UNBOUNDED SYMPATHY FOR WOMEN OF THIS KIND AND I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO APOLOGIZE FOR SUCH SYMPATHY
DUVERNOY BEGAN TO TURN IT OVER AS IT LAY ON THE MANTEL-PIECE LOOKING AT IT WITH COVETOUS EYES
DUVAL DID NOT RETURN TO SEE ME I DECIDED TO GO AND SEE HIM
BESIDES I AM NOT ILL
AT THIS MOMENT PRUDENCE REAPPEARED
PROMISE ME FATHER I SAID THAT YOU WILL DO NOTHING TO GIVE MARGUERITE PAIN MY FATHER STOPPED LOOKED AT ME DISDAINFULLY AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SAYING I BELIEVE YOU ARE MAD AFTER THIS HE WENT OUT SHUTTING THE DOOR VIOLENTLY AFTER HIM
I KNOW MARGUERITE
LEAVE HER ALONE
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS SMILING ACROSS AT MARGUERITE TO ASK HER WHOM ARE YOU LOOKING AT MARGUERITE GAUTIER YOU KNOW HER YES I AM HER MILLINER AND SHE IS A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE DO YOU LIVE IN THE RUE D'ANTIN NO
THUS HE SAID TO THE MAGDALEN
IS SUPPER READY ASKED MARGUERITE
GOOD-BYE MY DEAR MARGUERITE
I TOLD HER ALL I KNEW AND ADDED THAT YOU WERE A CHARMING YOUNG MAN
DID HE SEEM PUT OUT NO POOR MAN THIS POOR MAN WAS SAID IN A TONE IMPOSSIBLE TO RENDER
PAY ME AND SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
WHEN FULL OF MY SORROWFUL EMOTIONS I ARRIVED AT THE BALL IT WAS ALREADY VERY ANIMATED
YOU WILL TELL ME ABOUT IT LATER
I PREFERRED TO OWE YOU NOTHING
I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING
SHE ASCRIBED THIS PREOCCUPATION TO HER ANXIETY IN REGARD TO THE EVENTS WHICH HAD HAPPENED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS
GOOD-BYE GOOD-BYE PRUDENCE SAW ME TO THE DOOR AND I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOMS WITH TEARS OF RAGE IN MY EYES AND A DESIRE FOR VENGEANCE IN MY HEART
BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW SHE THINKS YOU CHARMING NO SHE HASN'T TOLD YOU NOT AT ALL HOW ARE YOU HERE I HAVE COME TO PAY HER A VISIT AT MIDNIGHT WHY NOT FARCEUR SHE HAS RECEIVED ME AS A MATTER OF FACT VERY BADLY SHE WILL RECEIVE YOU BETTER BY AND BYE DO YOU THINK SO I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR HER NO HARM IN THAT
WHEN WE ENTERED THE DINING-ROOM MARGUERITE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND GASTON HOLDING HER HANDS WAS SPEAKING TO HER IN A LOW VOICE
TO-DAY I AM ILL
SOME PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER HAPPENING TO BE AT BAGNERES TOOK UPON THEMSELVES TO EXPLAIN MADEMOISELLE GAUTIER'S TRUE POSITION TO THE DUKE
YOU WENT AWAY SO SUDDENLY THAT I FORGOT TO PAY YOU
ONE THING WHICH YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE PERHAPS ARMAND IS THAT I PRAYED GOD TO GIVE ME STRENGTH
LEAVES MARGUERITE'S HOW UNREASONABLE YOU ARE
WHATEVER HAPPENS I LOVED YOU WELL ARMAND AND I WOULD HAVE DIED LONG AGO IF I HAD NOT HAD THE MEMORY OF YOUR LOVE TO HELP ME AND A SORT OF VAGUE HOPE OF SEEING YOU BESIDE ME AGAIN
IT MUST SEEM STRANGE TO YOU THAT I AM READY TO TAKE YOU AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
NEVERTHELESS I WAS ANXIOUS TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN MARGUERITE AND ARMAND
SHE WAS WRITING
WE SAT DOWN TO TABLE
I KNOW NOT
IN VAIN FOR IT WAS LOCKED
ARMAND DUVAL'S ADDRESS I ASKED
IF YOU HAD ONLY MET ME TO-DAY YOU WOULD BE TOO DELIGHTED WITH WHAT I PROMISED YOU AND YOU WOULD NOT QUESTION ME AS TO WHAT I DID THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
MARGUERITE HAD ALMOST INSISTED ON MY GOING TO PARIS
DID YOU KNOW MARGUERITE GAUTIER THE ANSWER WAS THE USUAL
WHEN HE DIED I CRIED MORE THAN WHEN MY MOTHER DIED
SHE SAW HOW DEEPLY I HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY THE WHOLE SCENE AND COMING UP TO ME HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING
SHE MAKES A MISTAKE
I WAS MISTAKEN
I WROTE TO PRUDENCE TO SAY THAT I ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF THE COMTE DE N AND THAT SHE WAS TO TELL HIM THAT I WOULD SUP WITH HER AND HIM
AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE
IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME THAT I SENT HER MANON LESCAUT
WITHOUT TELLING YOU OF IT I KNOW ALSO BUT IN A MOMENT OF MADNESS HE MIGHT HAVE LOST PART OF WHAT I HAVE SAVED DURING MANY YEARS FOR MY DAUGHTER'S PORTION FOR HIM AND FOR THE REPOSE OF MY OLD AGE
YOU AMAZE ME WHEN I SEE YOU SO TOUCHY
PASSING BY THE RUE D'ANTIN I SAW MARGUERITE'S COUPE WAITING FOR HER AT THE DOOR
WHEN I EMBRACED MY SISTER I REMEMBERED WHAT MARGUERITE HAD SAID ABOUT HER IN HER LETTER AND I SAW AT ONCE HOW LITTLE MY SISTER GOOD AS SHE WAS WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS
IF YOU CALL AGAIN TO-DAY WAIT FOR ME TILL FOUR
DE N A FAIR ORNAMENT OF THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES ALMOST ALWAYS DRESSED IN PINK OR BLUE AND DRIVING TWO BIG BLACK HORSES WHICH TONY HAD SOLD HER FOR 10,000 FRANCS AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD PAID AFTER HER FASHION
FIFTEEN REPEATED THE AUCTIONEER
DO NOT COMMIT THIS FOLLY
SHE WAS NOT ONLY SUFFERING FROM THE SAME COMPLAINT BUT SHE WAS SO LIKE MARGUERITE IN APPEARANCE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR SISTERS
HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE EMPTY GRAVE
ARE YOU UNWELL TOO NO BUT YOU
SHE SEEMED GREATLY SURPRISED THAT A STRANGER WANTED TO BUY A PLOT OF GROUND AND GIVE MARGUERITE A NEW GRAVE AND SHE IMMEDIATELY SIGNED THE AUTHORIZATION THAT I ASKED HER FOR BELIEVE ME IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE QUITE WELL HAVE NO FEAR
THEY ARE GUARDED BETTER BY THEIR CALCULATIONS THAN A VIRGIN BY HER MOTHER AND HER CONVENT
THIS CAME ABOUT THROUGH HIS HAVING ONCE ARRIVED TO DINE TETE-A-TETE WITH MARGUERITE AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER
IT IS THIS THAT EVER SINCE I HAVE SEEN YOU I KNOW NOT WHY YOU HAVE TAKEN A PLACE IN MY LIFE
SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH SEEMED TO ME AN INEXHAUSTIBLE CAPITAL
THIS PAPER SIGNED BY HIS NAME HAS DONE ME MORE GOOD THAN ALL THE PRESCRIPTIONS OF OUR GREAT DOCTOR
I HAVE OFTEN SEEN MARGUERITE AT THE THEATRE
IN THE END I COULD SEE NO WAY OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRE WHICH CLOSED UPON ME
BUT I LOVE YOU MADLY WELL MY FRIEND YOU MUST EITHER LOVE ME A LITTLE LESS OR UNDERSTAND ME A LITTLE BETTER
THERE ARE NO ENTIRELY PURE SENTIMENTS EXCEPT IN PERFECTLY CHASTE WOMEN
DUVAL CALMED DOWN A LITTLE BUT STILL WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE COULD NOT ANY LONGER ALLOW HIS SON TO RUIN HIMSELF OVER ME
IT IS TO MY OWN GENERATION THAT I SPEAK TO THOSE FOR WHOM THE THEORIES OF M
IT WAS TERRIBLE TO SEE IT IS HORRIBLE TO RELATE
IS STILL HERE AND HE IS BORING ME TO DEATH I CAN'T NOW WHAT IS HINDERING YOU THERE ARE TWO YOUNG FELLOWS HERE WHO WON'T GO TELL THEM THAT YOU MUST GO OUT I HAVE TOLD THEM WELL THEN LEAVE THEM IN THE HOUSE
HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
HOW I WISH YOU WERE HERE
IN MARGUERITE'S BOX WAS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD
DE G I WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM
IF A THUNDER-BOLT HAD FALLEN AT MY FEET I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LESS STARTLED THAN I WAS BY WHAT I READ
WHAT EQUAL SACRIFICE COULD YOU MAKE FOR HER ON YOUR PART AND WHEN YOU HAD GOT TIRED OF HER WHAT COULD YOU DO TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT YOU HAD TAKEN FROM HER
NO NO YOU MUST GO YOU MUST
THAT NIGHT AS SHE WAS GOING PRUDENCE COMPLAINED OF THE COLD AND ASKED MARGUERITE TO LEND HER A SHAWL
WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
THEN I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER NOT TO HAVE WRITTEN TO HER BUT TO HAVE GONE TO SEE HER AND THAT THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE TEARS THAT SHE WOULD SHED
IT IS NO GOOD TO ASK THEM FOR WHAT THEY CAN NOT GIVE WHAT HAS BECOME OF ARMAND I DON'T KNOW
THEY DO NOT SAY TO HER THAT THEY KNOW IT
IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY
I FOLLOWED WITH GASTON AS SHE OPENED THE WINDOW
NO NEWS MY FRIEND
GOOD-NIGHT WITHOUT ADDING ANOTHER WORD OR LISTENING TO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN STAMMERED OUT MARGUERITE RETURNED TO THE ROOM AND SLAMMED THE DOOR
WHO YOU WERE WHAT YOU DID WHAT MISTRESSES YOU HAD HAD
WHO HAS ONLY SOME NEPHEWS THEMSELVES RICH AND WHO GIVES HER ALL SHE WANTS WITHOUT ASKING ANYTHING IN RETURN
IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED
IT BECOMES AN OBSTACLE TO EVERY THING
I KNOW IT
IN THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES
THAT IS IT IN DEED AND TWO BIG TEARS FELL ON THE PAGES
YET SHE SMILES AND ALL HER THOUGHTS ALL HER SOUL ARE YOURS I AM SURE
HOPE MY FRIEND AND BE SURE OF ONE THING THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS MARGUERITE WILL ALWAYS BE YOURS YOU SWEAR IT DO I NEED TO SWEAR IT HOW SWEET IT IS TO LET ONESELF BE PERSUADED BY THE VOICE THAT ONE LOVES
COLOUR THE SKIN WITH THE DOWN OF A PEACH THAT NO HAND HAS TOUCHED AND YOU WILL HAVE THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THAT CHARMING COUNTENANCE
AH MY DEAR FELLOW DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF A COLONEL ON HALF-PAY AND THAT I WAS BROUGHT UP AT SAINT-DENIS
YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK YOU HAVE THOUGHT OF ME ALL DAY LONG DO YOU KNOW THAT I AM REALLY AFRAID THAT I SHALL GET VERY FOND OF YOU
WHEN SHALL I BE SEEING YOU SOON
I WOULD RATHER ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN THAN THAT YOU SHOULD QUARREL WITH YOUR FAMILY
I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE IMPRESSION OF WHAT I SAW WILL LAST BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT TILL MY TURN COMES ANY HUMAN THING CAN MAKE SO DEEP AN IMPRESSION ON ME
THIS UNEXPECTED MEETING MUST CERTAINLY HAVE UPSET HER
IN THE NEXT ROOM I FOUND NANINE SLEEPING OVER HER WORK
HOWEVER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER I WAS AT PRUDENCE'S
WILL YOU HAVE SUPPER WITH US NO CHARLES IS WAITING FOR ME YOU ARE STILL DEVOTED TO HIM CRAZY MY DEAR
HAVE A MISTRESS IF YOU WILL
THAT NIGHT MORE THAN EVER I REPROACHED MYSELF FOR WHAT I HAD DONE
HE RECEIVED ME AS KINDLY AS POSSIBLE BUT HE WAS THE LOVER THERE OF A WOMAN IN SOCIETY AND HE FEARED TO COMPROMISE HIMSELF IF HE WERE SEEN WITH ME
ON SEEING ME HE HELD OUT A BURNING HAND
I SALUTED HER CASUALLY WITH A GLANCE OF THE EYES AND A WAVE OF THE HAND
