AND I PROMISE YOU MISTRESS PRYNNE SHALL HEREAFTER BE MORE AMENABLE TO JUST AUTHORITY THAN YOU MAY HAVE FOUND HER HERETOFORE NAY IF YOUR WORSHIP CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT ANSWERED MASTER BRACKETT I SHALL OWN YOU FOR A MAN OF SKILL INDEED
IT OFFERED HER THE PARTRIDGE-BERRIES THE GROWTH OF THE PRECEDING AUTUMN BUT RIPENING ONLY IN THE SPRING AND NOW RED AS DROPS OF BLOOD UPON THE WITHERED LEAVES
HA
THESE SUPPLIED MATERIAL FOR PETTY ACTIVITY TO A MIND THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN EATEN UP WITH RUST
THOU MAYEST COVER UP THY SECRET FROM THE PRYING MULTITUDE
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS SHE
WE HAVE HAD AND MAY STILL HAVE WORSE THINGS TO TELL OF HIM
MY FELLOW-OFFICERS AND THE MERCHANTS AND SEA-CAPTAINS WITH WHOM MY OFFICIAL DUTIES BROUGHT ME INTO ANY MANNER OF CONNECTION VIEWED ME IN NO OTHER LIGHT AND PROBABLY KNEW ME IN NO OTHER CHARACTER
BUT NEVERTHELESS IT IS ANYTHING BUT AGREEABLE TO BE HAUNTED BY A SUSPICION THAT ONE'S INTELLECT IS DWINDLING AWAY OR EXHALING WITHOUT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE ETHER OUT OF A PHIAL
AFTER BECOMING IMBUED WITH POETIC SENTIMENT AT LONGFELLOW'S HEARTHSTONE--IT WAS TIME AT LENGTH THAT I SHOULD EXERCISE OTHER FACULTIES OF MY NATURE AND NOURISH MYSELF WITH FOOD FOR WHICH I HAD HITHERTO HAD LITTLE APPETITE
YET MR DIMMESDALE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SEEN THIS INDIVIDUAL'S CHARACTER MORE PERFECTLY IF A CERTAIN MORBIDNESS TO WHICH SICK HEARTS ARE LIABLE HAD NOT RENDERED HIM SUSPICIOUS OF ALL MANKIND
HESTER I AM MOST MISERABLE THE PEOPLE REVERENCE THEE SAID HESTER
THEN SHE WAS SUPPORTED BY AN UNNATURAL TENSION OF THE NERVES AND BY ALL THE COMBATIVE ENERGY OF HER CHARACTER WHICH ENABLED HER TO CONVERT THE SCENE INTO A KIND OF LURID TRIUMPH
THERE STOOD HESTER HOLDING LITTLE PEARL BY THE HAND
IT PAINED AND AT THE SAME TIME AMUSED ME TO BEHOLD THE TERRORS THAT ATTENDED MY ADVENT TO SEE A FURROWED CHEEK WEATHER-BEATEN BY HALF A CENTURY OF STORM TURN ASHY PALE AT THE GLANCE OF SO HARMLESS AN INDIVIDUAL AS MYSELF
THAT HE IS WEARY OF THE OLD WOODEN HOUSES THE MUD AND DUST THE DEAD LEVEL OF SITE AND SENTIMENT THE CHILL EAST WIND AND THE CHILLEST OF SOCIAL ATMOSPHERES;--ALL THESE AND WHATEVER FAULTS BESIDES HE MAY SEE OR IMAGINE ARE NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE
IT WAS DEBATED WHETHER OR NO WITH SAFETY TO THE COMMONWEAL YONDER SCARLET LETTER MIGHT BE TAKEN OFF YOUR BOSOM
BUT AS THOUGHTS ARE FROZEN AND UTTERANCE BENUMBED UNLESS THE SPEAKER STAND IN SOME TRUE RELATION WITH HIS AUDIENCE IT MAY BE PARDONABLE TO IMAGINE THAT A FRIEND A KIND AND APPREHENSIVE THOUGH NOT THE CLOSEST FRIEND IS LISTENING TO OUR TALK
IT WAS MY FOLLY
ON THE TABLE--IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND--STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
TRULY AS I SOUGHT TO CONVINCE HIM THE SHAME LAY IN THE COMMISSION OF THE SIN AND NOT IN THE SHOWING OF IT FORTH
IT WAS STRANGE THE WAY IN WHICH PEARL STOOD LOOKING SO STEADFASTLY AT THEM THROUGH THE DIM MEDIUM OF THE FOREST GLOOM HERSELF MEANWHILE ALL GLORIFIED WITH A RAY OF SUNSHINE THAT WAS ATTRACTED THITHERWARD AS BY A CERTAIN SYMPATHY
THEY BEHELD THE MINISTER LEANING ON HESTER'S SHOULDER AND SUPPORTED BY HER ARM AROUND HIM APPROACH THE SCAFFOLD AND ASCEND ITS STEPS
MY JOURNEY AND THE SIGHT OF THE HOLY APOSTLE YONDER AND THE FREE AIR WHICH I HAVE BREATHED HAVE DONE ME GOOD AFTER SO LONG CONFINEMENT IN MY STUDY
IT MIGHT BE PARTLY OWING TO THE STUDIED AUSTERITY OF HER DRESS AND PARTLY TO THE LACK OF DEMONSTRATION IN HER MANNERS
BUT ALL MY LIFE HAD BEEN MADE UP OF EARNEST STUDIOUS THOUGHTFUL QUIET YEARS BESTOWED FAITHFULLY FOR THE INCREASE OF MINE OWN KNOWLEDGE AND FAITHFULLY TOO THOUGH THIS LATTER OBJECT WAS BUT CASUAL TO THE OTHER--FAITHFULLY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN WELFARE
THE AGE HAD NOT SO MUCH REFINEMENT THAT ANY SENSE OF IMPROPRIETY RESTRAINED THE WEARERS OF PETTICOAT AND FARTHINGALE FROM STEPPING FORTH INTO THE PUBLIC WAYS AND WEDGING THEIR NOT UNSUBSTANTIAL PERSONS IF OCCASION WERE INTO THE THRONG NEAREST TO THE SCAFFOLD AT AN EXECUTION
BUT LET IT BE GUIDED BY THE WILL WHICH GOD HATH GRANTED ME
IF THE HUSSY STOOD UP FOR JUDGMENT BEFORE US FIVE THAT ARE NOW HERE IN A KNOT TOGETHER WOULD SHE COME OFF WITH SUCH A SENTENCE AS THE WORSHIPFUL MAGISTRATES HAVE AWARDED
THERE WAS A SENSE WITHIN HER--TOO ILL-DEFINED TO BE MADE A THOUGHT BUT WEIGHING HEAVILY ON HER MIND--THAT HER WHOLE ORB OF LIFE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER WAS CONNECTED WITH THIS SPOT AS WITH THE ONE POINT THAT GAVE IT UNITY
IT STILL HAUNTS ME AND INDUCES A SORT OF HOME-FEELING WITH THE PAST WHICH I SCARCELY CLAIM IN REFERENCE TO THE PRESENT PHASE OF THE TOWN
I HAVE NO HEAVENLY FATHER HUSH PEARL HUSH
HESTER PRYNNE THEREFORE DID NOT FLEE
HE BEARS NO LETTER OF INFAMY WROUGHT INTO HIS GARMENT AS THOU DOST BUT I SHALL READ IT ON HIS HEART
IT WAS AS IF AN EVIL SPIRIT POSSESSED THE CHILD AND HAD JUST THEN PEEPED FORTH IN MOCKERY
DO NOT BLACKEN YOUR FAME AND PERISH IN DISHONOUR
ITS RESULT ON EARTH COULD HARDLY FAIL TO BE INSANITY AND HEREAFTER THAT ETERNAL ALIENATION FROM THE GOOD AND TRUE OF WHICH MADNESS IS PERHAPS THE EARTHLY TYPE
OFTEN LIKEWISE ONE WAS THE GUEST OF THE OTHER IN HIS PLACE OF STUDY AND RETIREMENT
GRADUALLY THEY HAVE SUNK ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT
CANST THOU DO NOTHING FOR ME
AS IF IT WERE NO PORTION OF THE REAL EARTH BUT AN OVERGROWN VILLAGE IN CLOUD-LAND WITH ONLY IMAGINARY INHABITANTS TO PEOPLE ITS WOODEN HOUSES AND WALK ITS HOMELY LANES AND THE UNPICTURESQUE PROLIXITY OF ITS MAIN STREET
FINALLY ALL OTHER DIFFICULTIES BEING OBVIATED WOMAN CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PRELIMINARY REFORMS UNTIL SHE HERSELF SHALL HAVE UNDERGONE A STILL MIGHTIER CHANGE IN WHICH PERHAPS THE ETHEREAL ESSENCE WHEREIN SHE HAS HER TRUEST LIFE WILL BE FOUND TO HAVE EVAPORATED
THEN MOREOVER AS REGARDED HIS UNCEREMONIOUS EJECTMENT THE LATE SURVEYOR WAS NOT ALTOGETHER ILL-PLEASED TO BE RECOGNISED BY THE WHIGS AS AN ENEMY
SHE MAY BE STRANGE AND SHY AT FIRST BUT WILL SOON LEARN TO LOVE THEE BY THIS TIME PEARL HAD REACHED THE MARGIN OF THE BROOK AND STOOD ON THE FURTHER SIDE GAZING SILENTLY AT HESTER AND THE CLERGYMAN WHO STILL SAT TOGETHER ON THE MOSSY TREE-TRUNK WAITING TO RECEIVE HER
ELSE I SHALL PUT THEE INTO THE DARK CLOSET XVI
IT WAS THE POINT WHITHER THEIR PATHWAY HAD SO LONG BEEN TENDING AND DARKENING EVER AS IT STOLE ALONG--AND YET IT UNCLOSED A CHARM THAT MADE THEM LINGER UPON IT AND CLAIM ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND AFTER ALL ANOTHER MOMENT
THE FOLLOWING IS THE TABLE OF HIS ROMANCES STORIES AND OTHER WORKS
BUT EVEN WHEN THE MINISTER'S VOICE GREW HIGH AND COMMANDING--WHEN IT GUSHED IRREPRESSIBLY UPWARD--WHEN IT ASSUMED ITS UTMOST BREADTH AND POWER SO OVERFILLING THE CHURCH AS TO BURST ITS WAY THROUGH THE SOLID WALLS AND DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE OPEN AIR--STILL IF THE AUDITOR LISTENED INTENTLY AND FOR THE PURPOSE HE COULD DETECT THE SAME CRY OF PAIN
OH HESTER THOU ART MY BETTER ANGEL
I ENDEAVOURED TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH LONGER I COULD STAY IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AND YET GO FORTH A MAN
THEN INDEED MR DIMMESDALE SHUDDERED AND SLIGHTLY STIRRED
AT FIRST HIS EXPRESSION HAD BEEN CALM MEDITATIVE SCHOLAR-LIKE
IT MIGHT BE SPIRITUAL AND IMPARTED TO HIM BY ANGELICAL MINISTRATIONS
I HAVE SAID IT
HE WAS A SOLDIER LEGISLATOR JUDGE
HEAVEN LIKEWISE HAD FROWNED UPON HER AND SHE HAD NOT DIED
IT MAY BE THAT IT WAS THE TALISMAN OF A STERN AND SEVERE BUT YET A GUARDIAN SPIRIT WHO NOW FORSOOK HER
THIS INCIDENT RECALLED MY MIND IN SOME DEGREE TO ITS OLD TRACK
WRETCHED AND SINFUL AS I AM I HAVE HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN TO DRAG ON MY EARTHLY EXISTENCE IN THE SPHERE WHERE PROVIDENCE HATH PLACED ME
VII
HE GROPED ALONG AS STEALTHILY WITH AS CAUTIOUS A TREAD AND AS WARY AN OUTLOOK AS A THIEF ENTERING A CHAMBER WHERE A MAN LIES ONLY HALF ASLEEP--OR IT MAY BE BROAD AWAKE--WITH PURPOSE TO STEAL THE VERY TREASURE WHICH THIS MAN GUARDS AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE
UNTIL COMING TO THE BROAD FLAT ARMORIAL TOMBSTONE OF A DEPARTED WORTHY--PERHAPS OF ISAAC JOHNSON HIMSELF--SHE BEGAN TO DANCE UPON IT
HERE IT IS TRUE WERE NONE OF THE APPLIANCES WHICH POPULAR MERRIMENT WOULD SO READILY HAVE FOUND IN THE ENGLAND OF ELIZABETH'S TIME OR THAT OF JAMES--NO RUDE SHOWS OF A THEATRICAL KIND
HAST THOU ENTICED ME INTO A BOND THAT WILL PROVE THE RUIN OF MY SOUL NOT THY SOUL HE ANSWERED WITH ANOTHER SMILE
FAREWELL THAT FINAL WORD CAME FORTH WITH THE MINISTER'S EXPIRING BREATH
SHE NEVER BATTLED WITH THE PUBLIC BUT SUBMITTED UNCOMPLAININGLY TO ITS WORST USAGE
OR THAT A FANCY AT ONCE SO GORGEOUS AND SO DELICATE AS MUST HAVE BEEN REQUISITE TO CONTRIVE THE CHILD'S APPAREL WAS THE SAME THAT HAD ACHIEVED A TASK PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT IN IMPARTING SO DISTINCT A PECULIARITY TO HESTER'S SIMPLE ROBE
AMONG THOSE WHO PROMOTED THE DESIGN GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WAS SAID TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BUSY
IT IS DONE MUTTERED THE MINISTER COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS
THE GOVERNOR IN ADVANCE OF HIS VISITORS ASCENDED ONE OR TWO STEPS AND THROWING OPEN THE LEAVES OF THE GREAT HALL WINDOW FOUND HIMSELF CLOSE TO LITTLE PEARL
THE LEAVES MIGHT BESTREW HIM AND THE SOIL GRADUALLY ACCUMULATE AND FORM A LITTLE HILLOCK OVER HIS FRAME NO MATTER WHETHER THERE WERE LIFE IN IT OR NO
WELCOME HOME REVEREND SIR SAID THE PHYSICIAN AND HOW FOUND YOU THAT GODLY MAN THE APOSTLE ELIOT
THEIR WIDE SHORT TROUSERS WERE CONFINED ABOUT THE WAIST BY BELTS OFTEN CLASPED WITH A ROUGH PLATE OF GOLD AND SUSTAINING ALWAYS A LONG KNIFE AND IN SOME INSTANCES A SWORD
DENYING HIMSELF THIS FREAK AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CLOTH HE MET A DRUNKEN SEAMAN ONE OF THE SHIP'S CREW FROM THE SPANISH MAIN
THAT OLD MAN'S REVENGE HAS BEEN BLACKER THAN MY SIN
BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THIS VENERABLE WITCH-LADY HAD HEARD MR DIMMESDALE'S OUTCRY AND INTERPRETED IT WITH ITS MULTITUDINOUS ECHOES AND REVERBERATIONS AS THE CLAMOUR OF THE FIENDS AND NIGHT-HAGS WITH WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN TO MAKE EXCURSIONS IN THE FOREST
THERE COULD BE LITTLE DOUBT FOR INSTANCE THAT THIS VERY SHIP'S CREW THOUGH NO UNFAVOURABLE SPECIMENS OF THE NAUTICAL BROTHERHOOD HAD BEEN GUILTY AS WE SHOULD PHRASE IT OF DEPREDATIONS ON THE SPANISH COMMERCE SUCH AS WOULD HAVE PERILLED ALL THEIR NECKS IN A MODERN COURT OF JUSTICE
IT IS NOT LOVE BUT INSTINCT
THUS THE YOUNG AND PURE WOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOOK AT HER WITH THE SCARLET LETTER FLAMING ON HER BREAST--AT HER THE CHILD OF HONOURABLE PARENTS--AT HER THE MOTHER OF A BABE THAT WOULD HEREAFTER BE A WOMAN--AT HER WHO HAD ONCE BEEN INNOCENT--AS THE FIGURE THE BODY THE REALITY OF SIN
HERE ON THIS WILD OUTSKIRT OF THE EARTH I SHALL PITCH MY TENT
BUT HE CANNOT CATCH LITTLE PEARL SO SHE DREW HER MOTHER AWAY SKIPPING DANCING AND FRISKING FANTASTICALLY AMONG THE HILLOCKS OF THE DEAD PEOPLE LIKE A CREATURE THAT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH A BYGONE AND BURIED GENERATION NOR OWNED HERSELF AKIN TO IT
WHOEVER TOUCHES IT SHOULD LOOK WELL TO HIMSELF OR HE MAY FIND THE BARGAIN TO GO HARD AGAINST HIM INVOLVING IF NOT HIS SOUL YET MANY OF ITS BETTER ATTRIBUTES
THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HESTER THAT THE CHILD MIGHT REALLY BE SEEKING TO APPROACH HER WITH CHILDLIKE CONFIDENCE AND DOING WHAT SHE COULD AND AS INTELLIGENTLY AS SHE KNEW HOW TO ESTABLISH A MEETING-POINT OF SYMPATHY
HE HAS BUT INCREASED THE DEBT ANSWERED THE PHYSICIAN AND AS HE PROCEEDED HIS MANNER LOST ITS FIERCER CHARACTERISTICS AND SUBSIDED INTO GLOOM
THE WORLD HAD BEEN SO CHEERLESS
MUCH OF THE TIME WHICH SHE MIGHT READILY HAVE APPLIED TO THE BETTER EFFORTS OF HER ART SHE EMPLOYED IN MAKING COARSE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR
DID I MAKE A CONTRACT WITH HIM IN THE FOREST AND SIGN IT WITH MY BLOOD
WHY HAST THOU NOT AVENGED THYSELF ON ME I HAVE LEFT THEE TO THE SCARLET LETTER REPLIED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
YOU TREAD BEHIND HIS EVERY FOOTSTEP
AS IF THERE WERE A WITHERING SPELL IN THE SAD LETTER HER BEAUTY THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF HER WOMANHOOD DEPARTED LIKE FADING SUNSHINE AND A GRAY SHADOW SEEMED TO FALL ACROSS HER
IN THE AFTERNOON OF A CERTAIN SUMMER'S DAY AFTER PEARL GREW BIG ENOUGH TO RUN ABOUT SHE AMUSED HERSELF WITH GATHERING HANDFULS OF WILD FLOWERS AND FLINGING THEM ONE BY ONE AT HER MOTHER'S BOSOM
WHAT WOULD THE MINISTER HAVE SAID MOTHER
AND THE REVEREND ARTHUR DIMMESDALE'S BEST DISCERNING FRIENDS AS WE HAVE INTIMATED VERY REASONABLY IMAGINED THAT THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE HAD DONE ALL THIS FOR THE PURPOSE--BESOUGHT IN SO MANY PUBLIC AND DOMESTIC AND SECRET PRAYERS--OF RESTORING THE YOUNG MINISTER TO HEALTH
SHE WONDERED WHAT SORT OF HERBS THEY WERE WHICH THE OLD MAN WAS SO SEDULOUS TO GATHER
BEHOLD
NOT THE LESS HE SHALL BE MINE THY ACTS ARE LIKE MERCY SAID HESTER BEWILDERED AND APPALLED
I REMEMBER IT
COME AWAY MOTHER OR HE WILL CATCH YOU
DOUBTLESS HOWEVER EITHER OF THESE STERN AND BLACK-BROWED PURITANS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT QUITE A SUFFICIENT RETRIBUTION FOR HIS SINS THAT AFTER SO LONG A LAPSE OF YEARS THE OLD TRUNK OF THE FAMILY TREE WITH SO MUCH VENERABLE MOSS UPON IT SHOULD HAVE BORNE AS ITS TOPMOST BOUGH AN IDLER LIKE MYSELF
HE REPEATED THE WORD--"ALONE HESTER THOU SHALL NOT GO ALONE ANSWERED SHE IN A DEEP WHISPER
BUT OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH TOO HAD PERCEPTIONS THAT WERE ALMOST INTUITIVE
YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENTER ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE
AND SHE MUST EITHER SUSTAIN AND CARRY IT FORWARD BY THE ORDINARY RESOURCES OF HER NATURE OR SINK BENEATH IT
MIGHT THERE NOT BE AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO QUAFF A LAST LONG BREATHLESS DRAUGHT OF THE CUP OF WORMWOOD AND ALOES WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL HER YEARS OF WOMANHOOD HAD BEEN PERPETUALLY FLAVOURED
THEY WERE ROUGH-LOOKING DESPERADOES WITH SUN-BLACKENED FACES AND AN IMMENSITY OF BEARD
VERY SOON HOWEVER HIS LOOK BECAME KEEN AND PENETRATIVE
NOW DURING A CONVERSATION OF SOME TWO OR THREE MOMENTS BETWEEN THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE AND THIS EXCELLENT AND HOARY-BEARDED DEACON IT WAS ONLY BY THE MOST CAREFUL SELF-CONTROL THAT THE FORMER COULD REFRAIN FROM UTTERING CERTAIN BLASPHEMOUS SUGGESTIONS THAT ROSE INTO HIS MIND RESPECTING THE COMMUNION-SUPPER
WITH NO HIGHER MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD BUT WITH A LARGER SCOPE OF ENJOYMENT THAN THEIRS AND WITH ALL THEIR BLESSED IMMUNITY FROM THE DREARINESS AND DUSKINESS OF AGE
THEY ARE NEW TO ME
HIS GOURMANDISM WAS A HIGHLY AGREEABLE TRAIT
BUT HE LEAPED ACROSS THE PLASHY PLACES THRUST HIMSELF THROUGH THE CLINGING UNDERBRUSH CLIMBED THE ASCENT PLUNGED INTO THE HOLLOW AND OVERCAME IN SHORT ALL THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE TRACK WITH AN UNWEARIABLE ACTIVITY THAT ASTONISHED HIM
SHE RANSACKED HER CONSCIENCE--WHICH WAS FULL OF HARMLESS LITTLE MATTERS LIKE HER POCKET OR HER WORK-BAG--AND TOOK HERSELF TO TASK POOR THING
EACH A GHOST AND AWE-STRICKEN AT THE OTHER GHOST
IF THE GUILLOTINE AS APPLIED TO OFFICE-HOLDERS WERE A LITERAL FACT INSTEAD OF ONE OF THE MOST APT OF METAPHORS IT IS MY SINCERE BELIEF THAT THE ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE VICTORIOUS PARTY WERE SUFFICIENTLY EXCITED TO HAVE CHOPPED OFF ALL OUR HEADS AND HAVE THANKED HEAVEN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
BE THE FOREGONE EVIL WHAT IT MIGHT HOW COULD THEY DOUBT THAT THEIR EARTHLY LIVES AND FUTURE DESTINIES WERE CONJOINED WHEN THEY BEHELD AT ONCE THE MATERIAL UNION AND THE SPIRITUAL IDEA IN WHOM THEY MET AND WERE TO DWELL IMMORTALLY TOGETHER
DOTH THE UNIVERSE LIE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF YONDER TOWN WHICH ONLY A LITTLE TIME AGO WAS BUT A LEAF-STREWN DESERT AS LONELY AS THIS AROUND US
XXI
YET IT WAS NOT WITHOUT HEAVY MISGIVINGS THAT I THUS BOUND MYSELF FOR HAVING CAST OFF ALL DUTY TOWARDS OTHER HUMAN BEINGS THERE REMAINED A DUTY TOWARDS HIM AND SOMETHING WHISPERED ME THAT I WAS BETRAYING IT IN PLEDGING MYSELF TO KEEP YOUR COUNSEL
AND THERE LACKS LITTLE THAT I SHOULD TAKE IN HAND TO DRIVE SATAN OUT OF HER WITH STRIPES THE STRANGER HAD ENTERED THE ROOM WITH THE CHARACTERISTIC QUIETUDE OF THE PROFESSION TO WHICH HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS BELONGING
AND NEVER HAD HESTER PRYNNE APPEARED MORE LADYLIKE IN THE ANTIQUE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM THAN AS SHE ISSUED FROM THE PRISON
SURELY SURELY WE HAVE RANSOMED ONE ANOTHER WITH ALL THIS WOE
BUT THE LITTLE STREAM WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED AND STILL KEPT TELLING ITS UNINTELLIGIBLE SECRET OF SOME VERY MOURNFUL MYSTERY THAT HAD HAPPENED--OR MAKING A PROPHETIC LAMENTATION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS YET TO HAPPEN--WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE DISMAL FOREST
THEN SUPPRESSING HIS VOICE--"HESTER
FOR AN INSTANT THE GAZE OF THE HORROR-STRICKEN MULTITUDE WAS CONCENTRATED ON THE GHASTLY MIRACLE
I LONGED TO KINDLE ONE
THE STEP WAS PALSIED NOW THAT HAD BEEN FOREMOST IN THE CHARGE
BUT I KNOW NOT WHAT TO SAY THE DISEASE IS WHAT I SEEM TO KNOW YET KNOW IT NOT YOU SPEAK IN RIDDLES LEARNED SIR SAID THE PALE MINISTER GLANCING ASIDE OUT OF THE WINDOW
THERE PLAYED AROUND HER MOUTH AND BEAMED OUT OF HER EYES A RADIANT AND TENDER SMILE THAT SEEMED GUSHING FROM THE VERY HEART OF WOMANHOOD
ATTEMPTING TO DO SO SHE THOUGHT OF THOSE LONG-PAST DAYS IN A DISTANT LAND WHEN HE USED TO EMERGE AT EVENTIDE FROM THE SECLUSION OF HIS STUDY AND SIT DOWN IN THE FIRELIGHT OF THEIR HOME AND IN THE LIGHT OF HER NUPTIAL SMILE
HERE WAS THE IRON LINK OF MUTUAL CRIME WHICH NEITHER HE NOR SHE COULD BREAK
YET IF THE CLERGYMAN WERE RIGHTLY VIEWED HIS STRENGTH SEEMED NOT OF THE BODY
TO HIS FEATURE AS TO ALL OTHER OBJECTS THE METEORIC LIGHT IMPARTED A NEW EXPRESSION
A MOCKERY AT WHICH ANGELS BLUSHED AND WEPT WHILE FIENDS REJOICED WITH JEERING LAUGHTER
BUT IN THE EDUCATION OF HER CHILD THE MOTHER'S ENTHUSIASM OF THOUGHT HAD SOMETHING TO WREAK ITSELF UPON
YET IF DEATH BE IN THIS CUP I BID THEE THINK AGAIN ERE THOU BEHOLDEST ME QUAFF IT
AND SEE WITH WHAT NATURAL SKILL SHE HAS MADE THOSE SIMPLE FLOWERS ADORN HER
THEY WERE AWE-STRICKEN LIKEWISE AT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE CRISIS FLUNG BACK TO THEM THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS AND REVEALED TO EACH HEART ITS HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AS LIFE NEVER DOES EXCEPT AT SUCH BREATHLESS EPOCHS
IN ALL HER MISERABLE EXPERIENCE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE SO AWFUL AND SO LOATHSOME AS THIS SENSE
A MORTAL MAN WITH ONCE A HUMAN HEART HAS BECOME A FIEND FOR HIS ESPECIAL TORMENT THE UNFORTUNATE PHYSICIAN WHILE UTTERING THESE WORDS LIFTED HIS HANDS WITH A LOOK OF HORROR AS IF HE HAD BEHELD SOME FRIGHTFUL SHAPE WHICH HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE USURPING THE PLACE OF HIS OWN IMAGE IN A GLASS
GLANCING AT SUCH MATTERS WITH THE SADDENED WEARY HALF-RELUCTANT INTEREST WHICH WE BESTOW ON THE CORPSE OF DEAD ACTIVITY--AND EXERTING MY FANCY SLUGGISH WITH LITTLE USE TO RAISE UP FROM THESE DRY BONES AN IMAGE OF THE OLD TOWN'S BRIGHTER ASPECT WHEN INDIA WAS A NEW REGION AND ONLY SALEM KNEW THE WAY THITHER--I CHANCED TO LAY MY HAND ON A SMALL PACKAGE CAREFULLY DONE UP IN A PIECE OF ANCIENT YELLOW PARCHMENT
WHAT HAVE THEY ALL COME TO DO HERE IN THE MARKET-PLACE THEY WAIT TO SEE THE PROCESSION PASS SAID HESTER
MOREOVER AT A PROPER SEASON THE TITHING-MEN MUST TAKE HEED THAT SHE GO BOTH TO SCHOOL AND TO MEETING THE YOUNG MINISTER ON CEASING TO SPEAK HAD WITHDRAWN A FEW STEPS FROM THE GROUP AND STOOD WITH HIS FACE PARTIALLY CONCEALED IN THE HEAVY FOLDS OF THE WINDOW-CURTAIN
BUT IN NO LONG TIME AFTER THE PHYSICIAN'S DEATH THE WEARER OF THE SCARLET LETTER DISAPPEARED AND PEARL ALONG WITH HER
P CLERK OF THIS PARISH WAS NEVER MORE FAITHFULLY FOLLOWED
SHADOWY GUESTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS PERILOUS AS DEMONS TO THEIR ENTERTAINER COULD THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN SO MUCH AS KNOCKING AT HER DOOR
MORALLY AS WELL AS MATERIALLY THERE WAS A COARSER FIBRE IN THOSE WIVES AND MAIDENS OF OLD ENGLISH BIRTH AND BREEDING THAN IN THEIR FAIR DESCENDANTS SEPARATED FROM THEM BY A SERIES OF SIX OR SEVEN GENERATIONS
THAT IS THE HARDEST WORD YET
MARRY I TROW NOT PEOPLE SAY SAID ANOTHER THAT THE REVEREND MASTER DIMMESDALE HER GODLY PASTOR TAKES IT VERY GRIEVOUSLY TO HEART THAT SUCH A SCANDAL SHOULD HAVE COME UPON HIS CONGREGATION THE MAGISTRATES ARE GOD-FEARING GENTLEMEN BUT MERCIFUL OVERMUCH--THAT IS A TRUTH ADDED A THIRD AUTUMNAL MATRON
HER ONLY REAL COMFORT WAS WHEN THE CHILD LAY IN THE PLACIDITY OF SLEEP
CONTENTS INTRODUCTORY
HESTER FELT HERSELF IN SOME INDISTINCT AND TANTALIZING MANNER ESTRANGED FROM PEARL AS IF THE CHILD IN HER LONELY RAMBLE THROUGH THE FOREST HAD STRAYED OUT OF THE SPHERE IN WHICH SHE AND HER MOTHER DWELT TOGETHER AND WAS NOW VAINLY SEEKING TO RETURN TO IT
THIS UNHAPPY MAN HAD MADE THE VERY PRINCIPLE OF HIS LIFE TO CONSIST IN THE PURSUIT AND SYSTEMATIC EXERCISE OF REVENGE
BUT LITTLE PEARL WAS NOT CLAD IN RUSTIC WEEDS
LEAVE THIS WRECK AND RUIN HERE WHERE IT HATH HAPPENED
IT IS EASY TO SEE THE MOTHER'S PART IN HER
WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE WHISPERED HE
BUT THERE IS A FATALITY A FEELING SO IRRESISTIBLE AND INEVITABLE THAT IT HAS THE FORCE OF DOOM WHICH ALMOST INVARIABLY COMPELS HUMAN BEINGS TO LINGER AROUND AND HAUNT GHOST-LIKE THE SPOT WHERE SOME GREAT AND MARKED EVENT HAS GIVEN THE COLOUR TO THEIR LIFETIME
IT SHALL NOT CUMBER THY STEPS AS THOU TREADEST ALONG THE FOREST-PATH
NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE DIED AT PLYMOUTH NEW HAMPSHIRE ON MAY 18TH 1864
TWO OR THREE OF THEIR NUMBER AS I WAS ASSURED BEING GOUTY AND RHEUMATIC OR PERHAPS BED-RIDDEN NEVER DREAMED OF MAKING THEIR APPEARANCE AT THE CUSTOM-HOUSE DURING A LARGE PART OF THE YEAR
THE GLOW WHICH THEY HAD JUST BEFORE BEHELD BURNING ON HIS CHEEK WAS EXTINGUISHED LIKE A FLAME THAT SINKS DOWN HOPELESSLY AMONG THE LATE DECAYING EMBERS
SHE HAD BORNE THAT MORNING ALL THAT NATURE COULD ENDURE
HE SO UNATTAINABLE IN HIS WORLDLY POSITION AND STILL MORE SO IN THAT FAR VISTA OF HIS UNSYMPATHIZING THOUGHTS THROUGH WHICH SHE NOW BEHELD HIM
IT WAS AN AGE WHEN WHAT WE CALL TALENT HAD FAR LESS CONSIDERATION THAN NOW BUT THE MASSIVE MATERIALS WHICH PRODUCE STABILITY AND DIGNITY OF CHARACTER A GREAT DEAL MORE
WE WILL HAVE A HOME AND FIRESIDE OF OUR OWN
FOR HAUGHTY AS HER DEMEANOUR WAS SHE PERCHANCE UNDERWENT AN AGONY FROM EVERY FOOTSTEP OF THOSE THAT THRONGED TO SEE HER AS IF HER HEART HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE STREET FOR THEM ALL TO SPURN AND TRAMPLE UPON
INFAMY WAS BABBLING AROUND HER IN THE PUBLIC MARKET-PLACE
THIS IS AWFUL CRIED THE GOVERNOR SLOWLY RECOVERING FROM THE ASTONISHMENT INTO WHICH PEARL'S RESPONSE HAD THROWN HIM
I HAVE HEARD HIM SMACK HIS LIPS OVER DINNERS EVERY GUEST AT WHICH EXCEPT HIMSELF HAD LONG BEEN FOOD FOR WORMS
YES THESE WERE HER REALITIES--ALL ELSE HAD VANISHED
IT INDICATED THE RESTLESS VIVACITY OF HER SPIRIT WHICH TO-DAY WAS DOUBLY INDEFATIGABLE IN ITS TIP-TOE DANCE BECAUSE IT WAS PLAYED UPON AND VIBRATED WITH HER MOTHER'S DISQUIETUDE
AND IN CLOSE COMPANIONSHIP WITH HIM OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH A PERSON OF GREAT SKILL IN PHYSIC WHO FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS PAST HAD BEEN SETTLED IN THE TOWN
I WILL DIE FIRST MY POOR WOMAN SAID THE NOT UNKIND OLD MINISTER THE CHILD SHALL BE WELL CARED FOR--FAR BETTER THAN THOU CANST DO FOR IT GOD GAVE HER INTO MY KEEPING REPEATED HESTER PRYNNE RAISING HER VOICE ALMOST TO A SHRIEK
SHE COULD RECOGNIZE HER WILD DESPERATE DEFIANT MOOD THE FLIGHTINESS OF HER TEMPER AND EVEN SOME OF THE VERY CLOUD-SHAPES OF GLOOM AND DESPONDENCY THAT HAD BROODED IN HER HEART
SO GREAT A VICISSITUDE IN HIS LIFE COULD NOT AT ONCE BE RECEIVED AS REAL
THAT UNSUNNED SNOW IN THE MATRON'S BOSOM AND THE BURNING SHAME ON HESTER PRYNNE'S--WHAT HAD THE TWO IN COMMON
THUS ROGER CHILLINGWORTH SCRUTINISED HIS PATIENT CAREFULLY BOTH AS HE SAW HIM IN HIS ORDINARY LIFE KEEPING AN ACCUSTOMED PATHWAY IN THE RANGE OF THOUGHTS FAMILIAR TO HIM AND AS HE APPEARED WHEN THROWN AMIDST OTHER MORAL SCENERY THE NOVELTY OF WHICH MIGHT CALL OUT SOMETHING NEW TO THE SURFACE OF HIS CHARACTER
WHAT SHE COMPELLED HERSELF TO BELIEVE--WHAT FINALLY SHE REASONED UPON AS HER MOTIVE FOR CONTINUING A RESIDENT OF NEW ENGLAND--WAS HALF A TRUTH AND HALF A SELF-DELUSION
A GOOSE OF MOST PROMISING FIGURE BUT WHICH AT TABLE PROVED SO INVETERATELY TOUGH THAT THE CARVING-KNIFE WOULD MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON ITS CARCASE AND IT COULD ONLY BE DIVIDED WITH AN AXE AND HANDSAW
AN OLD PINE DESK WITH A THREE-LEGGED STOOL BESIDE IT
NEVERTHELESS VIXENLY AS SHE LOOKS MANY PEOPLE ARE SEEKING AT THIS VERY MOMENT TO SHELTER THEMSELVES UNDER THE WING OF THE FEDERAL EAGLE
THE CUSTOM-HOUSE MARKER IMPRINTED IT WITH A STENCIL AND BLACK PAINT ON PEPPER-BAGS AND BASKETS OF ANATTO AND CIGAR-BOXES AND BALES OF ALL KINDS OF DUTIABLE MERCHANDISE IN TESTIMONY THAT THESE COMMODITIES HAD PAID THE IMPOST AND GONE REGULARLY THROUGH THE OFFICE
THEREFORE SO FAR AS HIS DUTIES WOULD PERMIT HE TROD IN THE SHADOWY BY-PATHS AND THUS KEPT HIMSELF SIMPLE AND CHILDLIKE COMING FORTH WHEN OCCASION WAS WITH A FRESHNESS AND FRAGRANCE AND DEWY PURITY OF THOUGHT WHICH AS MANY PEOPLE SAID AFFECTED THEM LIKE THE SPEECH OF AN ANGEL
HESTER HAD OFTEN FANCIED THAT PROVIDENCE HAD A DESIGN OF JUSTICE AND RETRIBUTION IN ENDOWING THE CHILD WITH THIS MARKED PROPENSITY
IN TRUTH NOTHING SHORT OF A TOTAL CHANGE OF DYNASTY AND MORAL CODE IN THAT INTERIOR KINGDOM WAS ADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPULSES NOW COMMUNICATED TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND STARTLED MINISTER
THERE IS ONE LIKENESS WITHOUT WHICH MY GALLERY OF CUSTOM-HOUSE PORTRAITS WOULD BE STRANGELY INCOMPLETE BUT WHICH MY COMPARATIVELY FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION ENABLE ME TO SKETCH ONLY IN THE MEREST OUTLINE
WHO IS THAT MAN HESTER GASPED MR DIMMESDALE OVERCOME WITH TERROR
THE WISER EFFORT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DIFFUSE THOUGHT AND IMAGINATION THROUGH THE OPAQUE SUBSTANCE OF TO-DAY AND THUS TO MAKE IT A BRIGHT TRANSPARENCY
HERE NO DOUBT STATISTICS OF THE FORMER COMMERCE OF SALEM MIGHT BE DISCOVERED AND MEMORIALS OF HER PRINCELY MERCHANTS--OLD KING DERBY--OLD BILLY GRAY--OLD SIMON FORRESTER--AND MANY ANOTHER MAGNATE IN HIS DAY WHOSE POWDERED HEAD HOWEVER WAS SCARCELY IN THE TOMB BEFORE HIS MOUNTAIN PILE OF WEALTH BEGAN TO DWINDLE
WHY SHOULDST THOU TARRY SO MUCH AS ONE OTHER DAY IN THE TORMENTS THAT HAVE SO GNAWED INTO THY LIFE
IN THE WAY OF FURNITURE THERE IS A STOVE WITH A VOLUMINOUS FUNNEL
EXCEPT FOR THAT SMALL EXPENDITURE IN THE DECORATION OF HER INFANT HESTER BESTOWED ALL HER SUPERFLUOUS MEANS IN CHARITY ON WRETCHES LESS MISERABLE THAN HERSELF AND WHO NOT UNFREQUENTLY INSULTED THE HAND THAT FED THEM
SHE HAD WITNESSED THE INTENSE MISERY BENEATH WHICH THE MINISTER STRUGGLED OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY HAD CEASED TO STRUGGLE
THE NEXT TIME I PRAY YOU TO ALLOW ME ONLY A FAIR WARNING AND I SHALL BE PROUD TO BEAR YOU COMPANY
THESE EMOTIONS IN FACT AND ITS BITTEREST SCORN BESIDES SEEMED TO BE THE SOLE PORTION THAT SHE RETAINED IN THE UNIVERSAL HEART
FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAGISTRATES ARE TO GO BY AND THE MINISTERS AND ALL THE GREAT PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE WITH THE MUSIC AND THE SOLDIERS MARCHING BEFORE THEM AND WILL THE MINISTER BE THERE ASKED PEARL
WILT THOU NOT LOVE HIM
BUT THIS MINISTER
BUT THIS MINISTER
IN 3 PARTS 1876
DREADFUL AS IT WAS SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A SHELTER IN THE PRESENCE OF THESE THOUSAND WITNESSES
COME ALONG PEARL SAID SHE DRAWING HER AWAY COME AND LOOK INTO THIS FAIR GARDEN
THE UGLIEST WEEDS OF THE GARDEN WERE THEIR CHILDREN WHOM PEARL SMOTE DOWN AND UPROOTED MOST UNMERCIFULLY
THERE HE WAS WITH THE PEN STILL BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AND A VAST IMMEASURABLE TRACT OF WRITTEN SPACE BEHIND HIM
BUT IF THEY SEEK TO GLORIFY GOD LET THEM NOT LIFT HEAVENWARD THEIR UNCLEAN HANDS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THERE WAS AN IDEA OF PENANCE IN THIS MODE OF OCCUPATION AND THAT SHE OFFERED UP A REAL SACRIFICE OF ENJOYMENT IN DEVOTING SO MANY HOURS TO SUCH RUDE HANDIWORK
HE STILL WALKED ONWARD IF THAT MOVEMENT COULD BE SO DESCRIBED WHICH RATHER RESEMBLED THE WAVERING EFFORT OF AN INFANT WITH ITS MOTHER'S ARMS IN VIEW OUTSTRETCHED TO TEMPT HIM FORWARD
THE PRISON DOOR A THRONG OF BEARDED MEN IN SAD-COLOURED GARMENTS AND GREY STEEPLE-CROWNED HATS INTER-MIXED WITH WOMEN SOME WEARING HOODS AND OTHERS BAREHEADED WAS ASSEMBLED IN FRONT OF A WOODEN EDIFICE THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS HEAVILY TIMBERED WITH OAK AND STUDDED WITH IRON SPIKES
BUT WHO ART THOU THAT MEDDLEST IN THIS MATTER
THESE QUESTIONS WERE SOLEMNLY PROPOUNDED TO MR DIMMESDALE BY THE ELDER MINISTERS OF BOSTON AND THE DEACONS OF HIS CHURCH WHO TO USE THEIR OWN PHRASE DEALT WITH HIM ON THE SIN OF REJECTING THE AID WHICH PROVIDENCE SO MANIFESTLY HELD OUT
SUCH WAS THE POSITION WHICH THE MINISTER OCCUPIED AS HE BOWED HIS HEAD FORWARD ON THE CUSHIONS OF THE PULPIT AT THE CLOSE OF HIS ELECTION SERMON
THE WOMEN WHO WERE NOW STANDING ABOUT THE PRISON-DOOR STOOD WITHIN LESS THAN HALF A CENTURY OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE MAN-LIKE ELIZABETH HAD BEEN THE NOT ALTOGETHER UNSUITABLE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SEX
SPEAK OUT THE NAME
BUT THIS HAD BEEN A SIN OF PASSION NOT OF PRINCIPLE NOR EVEN PURPOSE
THUS THE PURITAN ELDERS IN THEIR BLACK CLOAKS STARCHED BANDS AND STEEPLE-CROWNED HATS SMILED NOT UNBENIGNANTLY AT THE CLAMOUR AND RUDE DEPORTMENT OF THESE JOLLY SEAFARING MEN
WITH THE SAME HARD DEMEANOUR SHE WAS LED BACK TO PRISON AND VANISHED FROM THE PUBLIC GAZE WITHIN ITS IRON-CLAMPED PORTAL
I CARED NOT AT THIS PERIOD FOR BOOKS
THEN MOREOVER THE WHITE LOCKS OF AGE WERE SOMETIMES FOUND TO BE THE THATCH OF AN INTELLECTUAL TENEMENT IN GOOD REPAIR
HER PRISON-DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN AND SHE CAME FORTH INTO THE SUNSHINE WHICH FALLING ON ALL ALIKE SEEMED TO HER SICK AND MORBID HEART AS IF MEANT FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN TO REVEAL THE SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST
AS OLD HOUSES HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE STREETS GET COVERED HALF-WAY TO THE EAVES BY THE ACCUMULATION OF NEW SOIL
THEREBY DEFRAUDING THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE OF TO-MORROW'S PRAYER AND SERMON
I HEAR VOICES IN THE GARDEN
TRULY THERE IS BOTH IN THE SCRIPTURE AND THE STATUTE-BOOK
A TOKEN IMPLICITLY TO BE RELIED ON OF A DEEPER ANTIPATHY IN THE BREAST OF THE LATTER THAN HE WAS WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF
NEVERTHELESS LOOKING AT THE OLD WARRIOR WITH AFFECTION--FOR SLIGHT AS WAS THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US MY FEELING TOWARDS HIM LIKE THAT OF ALL BIPEDS AND QUADRUPEDS WHO KNEW HIM MIGHT NOT IMPROPERLY BE TERMED SO,--I COULD DISCERN THE MAIN POINTS OF HIS PORTRAIT
METHINKS THOU ART TOO LATE ANSWERED THE MINISTER ENCOUNTERING HIS EYE FEARFULLY BUT FIRMLY
UP AND AWAY OH HESTER CRIED ARTHUR DIMMESDALE IN WHOSE EYES A FITFUL LIGHT KINDLED BY HER ENTHUSIASM FLASHED UP AND DIED AWAY THOU TELLEST OF RUNNING A RACE TO A MAN WHOSE KNEES ARE TOTTERING BENEATH HIM
SO IT EVER IS WHETHER THUS TYPIFIED OR NO THAT AN EVIL DEED INVESTS ITSELF WITH THE CHARACTER OF DOOM
WITH HIS OWN GHOSTLY HAND THE OBSCURELY SEEN BUT MAJESTIC FIGURE HAD IMPARTED TO ME THE SCARLET SYMBOL AND THE LITTLE ROLL OF EXPLANATORY MANUSCRIPT
SOMBRE AS IT WAS IT PUT ON THE KINDEST OF ITS MOODS TO WELCOME HER
WHILE AGAIN THE SCARLET LETTER BROUGHT HER BACK FROM THIS TWILIGHT INDISTINCTNESS AND REVEALED HER UNDER THE MORAL ASPECT OF ITS OWN ILLUMINATION
HE MARVELLED INDEED AT THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH HE HAD THRUST BACK THE KIND OLD MAN WHEN MERELY PROFFERING THE ADVICE WHICH IT WAS HIS DUTY TO BESTOW AND WHICH THE MINISTER HIMSELF HAD EXPRESSLY SOUGHT
THE ROAD AFTER THE TWO WAYFARERS HAD CROSSED FROM THE PENINSULA TO THE MAINLAND WAS NO OTHER THAN A FOOT-PATH
TO CONFESS THE TRUTH IT WAS MY GREATEST APPREHENSION--AS IT WOULD NEVER BE A MEASURE OF POLICY TO TURN OUT SO QUIET AN INDIVIDUAL AS MYSELF
ANOTHER FIGURE IN THE SCENE IS THE OUTWARD-BOUND SAILOR IN QUEST OF A PROTECTION
WHAT A RUIN HAS BEFALLEN THEE SAID HESTER WITH THE TEARS GUSHING INTO HER EYES
LET HIM LIVE
THE RECOGNITION FROM THIS INTENSE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING THE OBJECT OF SEVERE AND UNIVERSAL OBSERVATION THE WEARER OF THE SCARLET LETTER WAS AT LENGTH RELIEVED BY DISCERNING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CROWD A FIGURE WHICH IRRESISTIBLY TOOK POSSESSION OF HER THOUGHTS
MY CHILDREN HAVE HAD OTHER BIRTH-PLACES AND SO FAR AS THEIR FORTUNES MAY BE WITHIN MY CONTROL SHALL STRIKE THEIR ROOTS INTO UNACCUSTOMED EARTH
THE RAY QUIVERED TO AND FRO MAKING HER FIGURE DIM OR DISTINCT--NOW LIKE A REAL CHILD NOW LIKE A CHILD'S SPIRIT--AS THE SPLENDOUR WENT AND CAME AGAIN
IT HAD INDEED A VERY CHEERY ASPECT THE WALLS BEING OVERSPREAD WITH A KIND OF STUCCO IN WHICH FRAGMENTS OF BROKEN GLASS WERE PLENTIFULLY INTERMIXED
BUT I NEVER CONSIDERED IT AS OTHER THAN A TRANSITORY LIFE
AT THIS INSTANT OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THRUST HIMSELF THROUGH THE CROWD--OR PERHAPS SO DARK DISTURBED AND EVIL WAS HIS LOOK HE ROSE UP OUT OF SOME NETHER REGION--TO SNATCH BACK HIS VICTIM FROM WHAT HE SOUGHT TO DO
NOW THAT THERE WAS AN END THEY NEEDED MORE BREATH MORE FIT TO SUPPORT THE GROSS AND EARTHLY LIFE INTO WHICH THEY RELAPSED THAN THAT ATMOSPHERE WHICH THE PREACHER HAD CONVERTED INTO WORDS OF FLAME AND HAD BURDENED WITH THE RICH FRAGRANCE OF HIS THOUGHT
THUS THEREFORE THE FLOOR OF OUR FAMILIAR ROOM HAS BECOME A NEUTRAL TERRITORY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND FAIRY-LAND WHERE THE ACTUAL AND THE IMAGINARY MAY MEET AND EACH IMBUE ITSELF WITH THE NATURE OF THE OTHER
IT WAS INDEED A MAJESTIC IDEA THAT THE DESTINY OF NATIONS SHOULD BE REVEALED IN THESE AWFUL HIEROGLYPHICS ON THE COPE OF HEAVEN
I WILL NOT GIVE HER UP AND HERE BY A SUDDEN IMPULSE SHE TURNED TO THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN MR DIMMESDALE AT WHOM UP TO THIS MOMENT SHE HAD SEEMED HARDLY SO MUCH AS ONCE TO DIRECT HER EYES
SEE ANSWERED HESTER SMILING
ELSE I SHOULD LONG AGO HAVE THROWN OFF THESE GARMENTS OF MOCK HOLINESS AND HAVE SHOWN MYSELF TO MANKIND AS THEY WILL SEE ME AT THE JUDGMENT-SEAT
SPEAK THOU THE CHILD'S OWN MOTHER
HER ATTIRE WHICH INDEED SHE HAD WROUGHT FOR THE OCCASION IN PRISON AND HAD MODELLED MUCH AFTER HER OWN FANCY SEEMED TO EXPRESS THE ATTITUDE OF HER SPIRIT THE DESPERATE RECKLESSNESS OF HER MOOD BY ITS WILD AND PICTURESQUE PECULIARITY
AND AFTER MANY MANY YEARS A NEW GRAVE WAS DELVED NEAR AN OLD AND SUNKEN ONE IN THAT BURIAL-GROUND BESIDE WHICH KING'S CHAPEL HAS SINCE BEEN BUILT
HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN CHAPTER XV
AND SET MYSELF SERIOUSLY TO GATHER FROM IT WHATEVER PROFIT WAS TO BE HAD
STANDING ALONE IN THE WORLD--ALONE AS TO ANY DEPENDENCE ON SOCIETY AND WITH LITTLE PEARL TO BE GUIDED AND PROTECTED--ALONE AND HOPELESS OF RETRIEVING HER POSITION EVEN HAD SHE NOT SCORNED TO CONSIDER IT DESIRABLE--SHE CAST AWAY THE FRAGMENT OF A BROKEN CHAIN
AND THE BOND-SERVANT PERHAPS JUDGING FROM THE DECISION OF HER AIR AND THE GLITTERING SYMBOL IN HER BOSOM THAT SHE WAS A GREAT LADY IN THE LAND OFFERED NO OPPOSITION
HAST THOU SEEN IT NO MATTER DARLING RESPONDED MISTRESS HIBBINS MAKING PEARL A PROFOUND REVERENCE
FOR THE ACCUMULATING DAYS AND ADDED YEARS WOULD PILE UP THEIR MISERY UPON THE HEAP OF SHAME
IN GIVING HER EXISTENCE A GREAT LAW HAD BEEN BROKEN
AND SHE NEVER RESPONDED TO THESE ATTACKS SAVE BY A FLUSH OF CRIMSON THAT ROSE IRREPRESSIBLY OVER HER PALE CHEEK AND AGAIN SUBSIDED INTO THE DEPTHS OF HER BOSOM
ON THE BREAST OF HER GOWN IN FINE RED CLOTH SURROUNDED WITH AN ELABORATE EMBROIDERY AND FANTASTIC FLOURISHES OF GOLD THREAD APPEARED THE LETTER A
IT HAD THE EFFECT OF A SPELL TAKING HER OUT OF THE ORDINARY RELATIONS WITH HUMANITY AND ENCLOSING HER IN A SPHERE BY HERSELF
HERE LIKEWISE--THE GERM OF THE WRINKLE-BROWED GRIZZLY-BEARDED CAREWORN MERCHANT--WE HAVE THE SMART YOUNG CLERK WHO GETS THE TASTE OF TRAFFIC AS A WOLF-CUB DOES OF BLOOD AND ALREADY SENDS ADVENTURES IN HIS MASTER'S SHIPS WHEN HE HAD BETTER BE SAILING MIMIC BOATS UPON A MILL-POND
IT WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF THOSE MEMORABLE WORDS OF HIS--"I'LL TRY SIR"--SPOKEN ON THE VERY VERGE OF A DESPERATE AND HEROIC ENTERPRISE AND BREATHING THE SOUL AND SPIRIT OF NEW ENGLAND HARDIHOOD COMPREHENDING ALL PERILS AND ENCOUNTERING ALL
IT WAS THE CAPITAL LETTER A
POOR MISERABLE MAN
MUCH OF THE MARBLE COLDNESS OF HESTER'S IMPRESSION WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HER LIFE HAD TURNED IN A GREAT MEASURE FROM PASSION AND FEELING TO THOUGHT
OF A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS TEMPERAMENT THERE WAS INEVITABLY A TINGE OF THE DEVOTIONAL IN HIS MOOD
IT WAS SHUT UP TO BE MILDEWED AND MOULDER AWAY IN THE COFFINS OF THE DEAD
ONE DAY LEANING HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND AND HIS ELBOW ON THE SILL OF THE OPEN WINDOW THAT LOOKED TOWARDS THE GRAVE-YARD HE TALKED WITH ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS EXAMINING A BUNDLE OF UNSIGHTLY PLANTS
BUT BENEATH IT ALL HIS FACULTY OF DIVINING MEN AND WOMEN WAS EXERCISED WITH ALMOST UNCANNY PRESCIENCE AND SUBTLETY
SCORN BITTERNESS UNPROVOKED MALIGNITY GRATUITOUS DESIRE OF ILL RIDICULE OF WHATEVER WAS GOOD AND HOLY ALL AWOKE TO TEMPT EVEN WHILE THEY FRIGHTENED HIM
HE LOOKED LIKE A GHOST EVOKED UNSEASONABLY FROM THE GRAVE
BY ITS AID IN ALL THE SUBSEQUENT RELATIONS BETWIXT HIM AND MR DIMMESDALE NOT MERELY THE EXTERNAL PRESENCE BUT THE VERY INMOST SOUL OF THE LATTER SEEMED TO BE BROUGHT OUT BEFORE HIS EYES SO THAT HE COULD SEE AND COMPREHEND ITS EVERY MOVEMENT
ACCOMPLISHING SO MUCH PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IMAGINED AND HOPED SO LITTLE
BUT THOU SHALT LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND THEE
TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE GREAT HEART WAS THOROUGHLY APPALLED YET OVERFLOWING WITH TEARFUL SYMPATHY AS KNOWING THAT SOME DEEP LIFE-MATTER--WHICH IF FULL OF SIN WAS FULL OF ANGUISH AND REPENTANCE LIKEWISE--WAS NOW TO BE LAID OPEN TO THEM
MEDDLE NO MORE WITH IT
AND HALF-CRAZED BETWIXT ALARM AND CURIOSITY WOULD GO KNOCKING FROM DOOR TO DOOR SUMMONING ALL THE PEOPLE TO BEHOLD THE GHOST--AS HE NEEDS MUST THINK IT--OF SOME DEFUNCT TRANSGRESSOR
AND THAT THOU MAYEST LIVE TAKE OFF THIS DRAUGHT WITHOUT FURTHER EXPOSTULATION OR DELAY HESTER PRYNNE DRAINED THE CUP AND AT THE MOTION OF THE MAN OF SKILL SEATED HERSELF ON THE BED WHERE THE CHILD WAS SLEEPING
THERE MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEE AND THEE ALONE SINCE THOU HAST BEEN DEEPLY WRONGED AND HAST IT AT THY WILL TO PARDON
RESOLVE FOR ME THOU MUST DWELL NO LONGER WITH THIS MAN SAID HESTER SLOWLY AND FIRMLY
THE GRASP COLD AS IT WAS TOOK AWAY WHAT WAS DREARIEST IN THE INTERVIEW
AND MOREOVER IS THERE NOT A QUALITY OF AWFUL SACREDNESS IN THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS MOTHER AND THIS CHILD AY--HOW IS THAT GOOD MASTER DIMMESDALE INTERRUPTED THE GOVERNOR
SO FAR AS CONCERNS THE OVERTHROW OR PRESERVATION OF HIS FAIR FAME AND HIS EARTHLY STATE AND PERCHANCE HIS LIFE HE IS IN MY HANDS
WALKING TO AND FRO WITH THOSE LONELY FOOTSTEPS IN THE LITTLE WORLD WITH WHICH SHE WAS OUTWARDLY CONNECTED IT NOW AND THEN APPEARED TO HESTER--IF ALTOGETHER FANCY IT WAS NEVERTHELESS TOO POTENT TO BE RESISTED--SHE FELT OR FANCIED THEN THAT THE SCARLET LETTER HAD ENDOWED HER WITH A NEW SENSE
OVER THE ENTRANCE HOVERS AN ENORMOUS SPECIMEN OF THE AMERICAN EAGLE WITH OUTSPREAD WINGS A SHIELD BEFORE HER BREAST AND IF I RECOLLECT ARIGHT A BUNCH OF INTERMINGLED THUNDERBOLTS AND BARBED ARROWS IN EACH CLAW
THEY KNEW THESE EXCELLENT OLD PERSONS THAT BY ALL ESTABLISHED RULE--AND AS REGARDED SOME OF THEM WEIGHED BY THEIR OWN LACK OF EFFICIENCY FOR BUSINESS--THEY OUGHT TO HAVE GIVEN PLACE TO YOUNGER MEN MORE ORTHODOX IN POLITICS AND ALTOGETHER FITTER THAN THEMSELVES TO SERVE OUR COMMON UNCLE
LET THEREFORE THY HUSBAND BE TO THE WORLD AS ONE ALREADY DEAD AND OF WHOM NO TIDINGS SHALL EVER COME
HE GOING HOME TO A BETTER WORLD I LIKEWISE WAS ON MY WAY HOMEWARD WHEN THIS LIGHT SHONE OUT
IN 24 VOLUMES 1879
YEA FORSOOTH REPLIED THE BOND-SERVANT STARING WITH WIDE-OPEN EYES AT THE SCARLET LETTER WHICH BEING A NEW-COMER IN THE COUNTRY HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN
SKILFUL MEN OF THE MEDICAL AND CHIRURGICAL PROFESSION WERE OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE COLONY
THE COURSE OF THE LITTLE BROOK MIGHT BE TRACED BY ITS MERRY GLEAM AFAR INTO THE WOOD'S HEART OF MYSTERY WHICH HAD BECOME A MYSTERY OF JOY
WITHOUT TAKING OVERMUCH UPON MYSELF MY GOOD WORD WILL GO FAR TOWARDS GAINING ANY STRANGE GENTLEMAN A FAIR RECEPTION FROM YONDER POTENTATE YOU WOT OF I PROFESS MADAM ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN WITH A GRAVE OBEISANCE SUCH AS THE LADY'S RANK DEMANDED AND HIS OWN GOOD BREEDING MADE IMPERATIVE--"I PROFESS ON MY CONSCIENCE AND CHARACTER THAT I AM UTTERLY BEWILDERED AS TOUCHING THE PURPORT OF YOUR WORDS
IN OUR NATIVE LAND WHETHER IN SOME REMOTE RURAL VILLAGE OR IN VAST LONDON--OR SURELY IN GERMANY IN FRANCE IN PLEASANT ITALY--THOU WOULDST BE BEYOND HIS POWER AND KNOWLEDGE
IT HAD STUPEFIED ALL BLESSED IMPULSES AND AWAKENED INTO VIVID LIFE THE WHOLE BROTHERHOOD OF BAD ONES
FOR IT WAS USUALLY MORE LIKE THE BROAD AND LONESOME GREEN BEFORE A VILLAGE MEETING-HOUSE THAN THE CENTRE OF A TOWN'S BUSINESS
WHILE ONE SOLEMN OLD TREE GROANED DOLEFULLY TO ANOTHER AS IF TELLING THE SAD STORY OF THE PAIR THAT SAT BENEATH OR CONSTRAINED TO FORBODE EVIL TO COME
COULD IT BE TRUE
HEAVEN HATH GRANTED THEE AN OPEN IGNOMINY THAT THEREBY THOU MAYEST WORK OUT AN OPEN TRIUMPH OVER THE EVIL WITHIN THEE AND THE SORROW WITHOUT
TAKING A HANDFUL OF THESE SHE ARRANGED THEM ALONG THE LINES OF THE SCARLET LETTER THAT DECORATED THE MATERNAL BOSOM TO WHICH THE BURRS AS THEIR NATURE WAS TENACIOUSLY ADHERED
KNOWING WHAT THIS POOR FALLEN MAN HAD ONCE BEEN HER WHOLE SOUL WAS MOVED BY THE SHUDDERING TERROR WITH WHICH HE HAD APPEALED TO HER--THE OUTCAST WOMAN--FOR SUPPORT AGAINST HIS INSTINCTIVELY DISCOVERED ENEMY
YET ONE TOMB-STONE SERVED FOR BOTH
CERTAINLY THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL DEFECT
WHAT CANST THOU DO FOR THE CHILD IN THIS KIND I CAN TEACH MY LITTLE PEARL WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE LAYING HER FINGER ON THE RED TOKEN
THESE REVELATIONS UNLESS I GREATLY ERR ARE MEANT MERELY TO PROMOTE THE INTELLECTUAL SATISFACTION OF ALL INTELLIGENT BEINGS WHO WILL STAND WAITING ON THAT DAY TO SEE THE DARK PROBLEM OF THIS LIFE MADE PLAIN
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THE AGONY WITH WHICH THIS PUBLIC VENERATION TORTURED HIM
SHE WAS NOW OF AN AGE TO RUN LIGHTLY ALONG BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND CONSTANTLY IN MOTION FROM MORN TILL SUNSET COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED A MUCH LONGER JOURNEY THAN THAT BEFORE HER
HER FINAL EMPLOYMENT WAS TO GATHER SEAWEED OF VARIOUS KINDS AND MAKE HERSELF A SCARF OR MANTLE AND A HEAD-DRESS AND THUS ASSUME THE ASPECT OF A LITTLE MERMAID
A REVELATION HE COULD ALMOST SAY HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM
A LITTLE LONGER AND THOU NEEDEST NOT TO BE AFRAID TO TRACE WHOSE CHILD SHE IS
THUS SHE WILL BE A LIVING SERMON AGAINST SIN UNTIL THE IGNOMINIOUS LETTER BE ENGRAVED UPON HER TOMBSTONE
WHAT ART CAN DO I HAVE EXHAUSTED ON HIM
AND STILL BETTER IT MAY BE TO LEAVE THE MYSTERY AS WE FIND IT UNLESS PROVIDENCE REVEAL IT OF ITS OWN ACCORD
KEEP LIKEWISE MINE
HER PEARL--FOR SO HAD HESTER CALLED HER
FOR ONE INSTANT HE BELIEVED THAT THESE WORDS HAD PASSED HIS LIPS
ABOUT THIS PERIOD HOWEVER THE HEALTH OF MR DIMMESDALE HAD EVIDENTLY BEGUN TO FAIL
SHE DISCERNS IT MAY BE SUCH A HOPELESS TASK BEFORE HER
AND YET LET THEM SCORN ME AS THEY WILL STRONG TRAITS OF THEIR NATURE HAVE INTERTWINED THEMSELVES WITH MINE
THEY LITTLE GUESSED WHAT DEADLY PURPORT LURKED IN THOSE SELF-CONDEMNING WORDS
NOR WERE SPORTS WANTING SUCH AS THE COLONISTS HAD WITNESSED AND SHARED IN LONG AGO AT THE COUNTRY FAIRS AND ON THE VILLAGE-GREENS OF ENGLAND
PEARL POINTED UPWARDS ALSO AT A SIMILAR PICTURE IN THE HEAD-PIECE
THE MINISTER KNEW WELL THAT HE WAS HIMSELF ENSHRINED WITHIN THE STAINLESS SANCTITY OF HER HEART WHICH HUNG ITS SNOWY CURTAINS ABOUT HIS IMAGE IMPARTING TO RELIGION THE WARMTH OF LOVE AND TO LOVE A RELIGIOUS PURITY
IF STILL ALIVE SHE MUST NOW HAVE BEEN IN THE FLUSH AND BLOOM OF EARLY WOMANHOOD
THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS TALL WITH A FIGURE OF PERFECT ELEGANCE ON A LARGE SCALE
PRECEDED BY THE BEADLE AND ATTENDED BY AN IRREGULAR PROCESSION OF STERN-BROWED MEN AND UNKINDLY VISAGED WOMEN HESTER PRYNNE SET FORTH TOWARDS THE PLACE APPOINTED FOR HER PUNISHMENT
WITH NOTHING NOW TO LOSE IN THE SIGHT OF MANKIND AND WITH NO HOPE AND SEEMINGLY NO WISH OF GAINING ANYTHING IT COULD ONLY BE A GENUINE REGARD FOR VIRTUE THAT HAD BROUGHT BACK THE POOR WANDERER TO ITS PATHS
SPEAK FOR ME
CALM GENTLE PASSIONLESS AS HE APPEARED THERE WAS YET WE FEAR A QUIET DEPTH OF MALICE HITHERTO LATENT BUT ACTIVE NOW IN THIS UNFORTUNATE OLD MAN WHICH LED HIM TO IMAGINE A MORE INTIMATE REVENGE THAN ANY MORTAL HAD EVER WREAKED UPON AN ENEMY
ONE DAY AS HER MOTHER STOOPED OVER THE CRADLE THE INFANT'S EYES HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE GLIMMERING OF THE GOLD EMBROIDERY ABOUT THE LETTER
I PITY THEE FOR THE GOOD THAT HAS BEEN WASTED IN THY NATURE AND I THEE ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE FOR THE HATRED THAT HAS TRANSFORMED A WISE AND JUST MAN TO A FIEND
BEFORE MR DIMMESDALE REACHED HOME HIS INNER MAN GAVE HIM OTHER EVIDENCES OF A REVOLUTION IN THE SPHERE OF THOUGHT AND FEELING
MOREOVER NOT THROUGH DUSKY GRIEF BUT THE ETHEREAL MEDIUM OF JOY
COME HE LONGS TO GREET THEE DOTH HE LOVE US SAID PEARL LOOKING UP WITH ACUTE INTELLIGENCE INTO HER MOTHER'S FACE
YOUR PRESENT LIFE IS NOT LESS HOLY IN VERY TRUTH THAN IT SEEMS IN PEOPLE'S EYES
OPEN A PASSAGE
DOST THOU THINK I HAVE BEEN TO THE FOREST SO MANY TIMES AND HAVE YET NO SKILL TO JUDGE WHO ELSE HAS BEEN THERE
THEN ALSO THE BLAMELESS PURITY OF HER LIFE DURING ALL THESE YEARS IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SET APART TO INFAMY WAS RECKONED LARGELY IN HER FAVOUR
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE TEMPTER OF SOULS HAD THRUST THIS IDEA UPON HESTER'S CONTEMPLATION AND LAUGHED AT THE PASSIONATE AND DESPERATE JOY WITH WHICH SHE SEIZED AND THEN STROVE TO CAST IT FROM HER
A GREY-HEADED SHIPMASTER IN EACH GENERATION RETIRING FROM THE QUARTER-DECK TO THE HOMESTEAD WHILE A BOY OF FOURTEEN TOOK THE HEREDITARY PLACE BEFORE THE MAST CONFRONTING THE SALT SPRAY AND THE GALE WHICH HAD BLUSTERED AGAINST HIS SIRE AND GRANDSIRE
AM I MAD
SHE MIGHT AND NOT IMPROBABLY WOULD HAVE SUFFERED DEATH FROM THE STERN TRIBUNALS OF THE PERIOD FOR ATTEMPTING TO UNDERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PURITAN ESTABLISHMENT
TWO OR THREE TIMES AS HER MOTHER AND SHE WENT HOMEWARD AND AS OFTEN AT SUPPER-TIME AND WHILE HESTER WAS PUTTING HER TO BED AND ONCE AFTER SHE SEEMED TO BE FAIRLY ASLEEP PEARL LOOKED UP WITH MISCHIEF GLEAMING IN HER BLACK EYES
PEARL WE HAVE AS YET HARDLY SPOKEN OF THE INFANT
AND STILL THE MORE IRRESISTIBLY THE DARKER THE TINGE THAT SADDENS IT
BY GIVING ME THIS BURNING TORTURE TO BEAR UPON MY BREAST
NOW SEE
SHE MADE THE SOMBRE CROWD CHEERFUL BY HER ERRATIC AND GLISTENING RAY EVEN AS A BIRD OF BRIGHT PLUMAGE ILLUMINATES A WHOLE TREE OF DUSKY FOLIAGE BY DARTING TO AND FRO HALF SEEN AND HALF CONCEALED AMID THE TWILIGHT OF THE CLUSTERING LEAVES
IS THERE SUCH A BLACK MAN
BUT YET ATTAINING THE GREAT OBJECT FOR WHICH THE HARMONY OF DRUM AND CLARION ADDRESSES ITSELF TO THE MULTITUDE--THAT OF IMPARTING A HIGHER AND MORE HEROIC AIR TO THE SCENE OF LIFE THAT PASSES BEFORE THE EYE
WITH SELDOM AN ALTERNATIVE OF GOOD ON EITHER HAND ALTHOUGH WHAT PRESENTS ITSELF TO HIM AS THE WORST EVENT MAY VERY PROBABLY BE THE BEST
AND HAD THE MOTHER AND CHILD REMAINED HERE LITTLE PEARL AT A MARRIAGEABLE PERIOD OF LIFE MIGHT HAVE MINGLED HER WILD BLOOD WITH THE LINEAGE OF THE DEVOUTEST PURITAN AMONG THEM ALL
HOW STRANGE INDEED
WHAT SAY YOU WORSHIPFUL MASTER BELLINGHAM
CERTAIN IT IS THAT SOME FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE SETTLEMENT OF THE TOWN THE WOODEN JAIL WAS ALREADY MARKED WITH WEATHER-STAINS AND OTHER INDICATIONS OF AGE WHICH GAVE A YET DARKER ASPECT TO ITS BEETLE-BROWED AND GLOOMY FRONT
AND SO CHANGED WAS HESTER PRYNNE'S REPUTE BEFORE THE PUBLIC THAT THE MATRON IN TOWN MOST EMINENT FOR RIGID MORALITY COULD NOT HAVE HELD SUCH INTERCOURSE WITH LESS RESULT OF SCANDAL THAN HERSELF
SHE KNEW THAT HER DEED HAD BEEN EVIL
BUT NOT TO SUGGEST MORE OBVIOUS REASONS IT MAY BE THAT THEY ARE KEPT SILENT BY THE VERY CONSTITUTION OF THEIR NATURE
WITH SUCH COMMODIOUSNESS OF SITUATION THESE TWO LEARNED PERSONS SAT THEMSELVES DOWN EACH IN HIS OWN DOMAIN YET FAMILIARLY PASSING FROM ONE APARTMENT TO THE OTHER AND BESTOWING A MUTUAL AND NOT INCURIOUS INSPECTION INTO ONE ANOTHER'S BUSINESS
HER MOTHER WITH A MORBID PURPOSE THAT MAY BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD HEREAFTER HAD BOUGHT THE RICHEST TISSUES THAT COULD BE PROCURED AND ALLOWED HER IMAGINATIVE FACULTY ITS FULL PLAY IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND DECORATION OF THE DRESSES WHICH THE CHILD WORE BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
THE LAW WE BROKE!--THE SIN HERE AWFULLY REVEALED!--LET THESE ALONE BE IN THY THOUGHTS
HE WILL DOUBTLESS SEEK OTHER MEANS OF SATIATING HIS DARK PASSION AND I!--HOW AM I TO LIVE LONGER BREATHING THE SAME AIR WITH THIS DEADLY ENEMY EXCLAIMED ARTHUR DIMMESDALE SHRINKING WITHIN HIMSELF AND PRESSING HIS HAND NERVOUSLY AGAINST HIS HEART--A GESTURE THAT HAD GROWN INVOLUNTARY WITH HIM
THAT LITTLE BABE HATH BEEN GIFTED WITH A VOICE TO SECOND AND CONFIRM THE COUNSEL WHICH THOU HAST HEARD
THIS IDEA OF HIS TRANSITORY STAY ON EARTH GAVE THE LAST EMPHASIS TO THE EFFECT WHICH THE PREACHER HAD PRODUCED
I DARE NOT QUIT MY POST THOUGH AN UNFAITHFUL SENTINEL WHOSE SURE REWARD IS DEATH AND DISHONOUR WHEN HIS DREARY WATCH SHALL COME TO AN END THOU ART CRUSHED UNDER THIS SEVEN YEARS WEIGHT OF MISERY REPLIED HESTER FERVENTLY RESOLVED TO BUOY HIM UP WITH HER OWN ENERGY
THOU WILT LOVE HIM--WILT THOU NOT AND WILL HE ALWAYS KEEP HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART INQUIRED PEARL
IT WAS A STRANGE RESERVE
MADAME HESTER WOULD HAVE WINCED AT THAT I WARRANT ME
BUT WHETHER FROM PRIDE OR RESIGNATION OR A FEELING THAT HER PENANCE MIGHT BEST BE WROUGHT OUT BY THIS UNUTTERABLE PAIN SHE RESISTED THE IMPULSE AND SAT ERECT PALE AS DEATH LOOKING SADLY INTO LITTLE PEARL'S WILD EYES
THEIR IMMEDIATE POSTERITY THE GENERATION NEXT TO THE EARLY EMIGRANTS WORE THE BLACKEST SHADE OF PURITANISM AND SO DARKENED THE NATIONAL VISAGE WITH IT THAT ALL THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS HAVE NOT SUFFICED TO CLEAR IT UP
FOR GOING BACK PERHAPS TO THE DAYS OF THE PROTECTORATE THOSE PAPERS MUST HAVE CONTAINED MANY REFERENCES TO FORGOTTEN OR REMEMBERED MEN AND TO ANTIQUE CUSTOMS WHICH WOULD HAVE AFFECTED ME WITH THE SAME PLEASURE AS WHEN I USED TO PICK UP INDIAN ARROW-HEADS IN THE FIELD NEAR THE OLD MANSE
KEEP WHERE THOU CANST HEAR THE BABBLE OF THE BROOK THE CHILD WENT SINGING AWAY FOLLOWING UP THE CURRENT OF THE BROOK AND STRIVING TO MINGLE A MORE LIGHTSOME CADENCE WITH ITS MELANCHOLY VOICE
AND ESPECIALLY TO WARN ALL CITIZENS CAREFUL OF THEIR SAFETY AGAINST INTRUDING ON THE PREMISES WHICH SHE OVERSHADOWS WITH HER WINGS
IF LITTLE PEARL WERE ENTERTAINED WITH FAITH AND TRUST AS A SPIRIT MESSENGER NO LESS THAN AN EARTHLY CHILD MIGHT IT NOT BE HER ERRAND TO SOOTHE AWAY THE SORROW THAT LAY COLD IN HER MOTHER'S HEART AND CONVERTED IT INTO A TOMB?--AND TO HELP HER TO OVERCOME THE PASSION ONCE SO WILD AND EVEN YET NEITHER DEAD NOR ASLEEP BUT ONLY IMPRISONED WITHIN THE SAME TOMB-LIKE HEART
AT ALL EVENTS THE HEALTH OF THE GOOD TOWN OF BOSTON SO FAR AS MEDICINE HAD AUGHT TO DO WITH IT HAD HITHERTO LAIN IN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF AN AGED DEACON AND APOTHECARY WHOSE PIETY AND GODLY DEPORTMENT WERE STRONGER TESTIMONIALS IN HIS FAVOUR THAN ANY THAT HE COULD HAVE PRODUCED IN THE SHAPE OF A DIPLOMA
NEITHER DO THOU IMAGINE THAT I SHALL CONTRIVE AUGHT AGAINST HIS LIFE
THE INTERIOR OF A HEART AFTER THE INCIDENT LAST DESCRIBED THE INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE CLERGYMAN AND THE PHYSICIAN THOUGH EXTERNALLY THE SAME WAS REALLY OF ANOTHER CHARACTER THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN
THEY WERE DOCUMENTS IN SHORT NOT OFFICIAL BUT OF A PRIVATE NATURE OR AT LEAST WRITTEN IN HIS PRIVATE CAPACITY AND APPARENTLY WITH HIS OWN HAND
WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HESTER PRYNNE
PLANTED DEEP IN THE TOWN'S EARLIEST INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD BY THESE TWO EARNEST AND ENERGETIC MEN THE RACE HAS EVER SINCE SUBSISTED HERE
COME MY LITTLE PEARL IT WAS A GHASTLY LOOK WITH WHICH HE REGARDED THEM
THE CARELESS SECURITY OF HIS LIFE IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE ON A REGULAR INCOME AND WITH BUT SLIGHT AND INFREQUENT APPREHENSIONS OF REMOVAL HAD NO DOUBT CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE TIME PASS LIGHTLY OVER HIM
BY NO MEANS
HE WAS NOT ILL-FITTED TO BE THE HEAD AND REPRESENTATIVE OF A COMMUNITY WHICH OWED ITS ORIGIN AND PROGRESS AND ITS PRESENT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT NOT TO THE IMPULSES OF YOUTH BUT TO THE STERN AND TEMPERED ENERGIES OF MANHOOD AND THE SOMBRE SAGACITY OF AGE
IT MIGHT BE TOO THAT A WITCH LIKE OLD MISTRESS HIBBINS THE BITTER-TEMPERED WIDOW OF THE MAGISTRATE WAS TO DIE UPON THE GALLOWS
HE HIMSELF ON THE OTHER HAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC HUMILITY AVOWED HIS BELIEF THAT IF PROVIDENCE SHOULD SEE FIT TO REMOVE HIM IT WOULD BE BECAUSE OF HIS OWN UNWORTHINESS TO PERFORM ITS HUMBLEST MISSION HERE ON EARTH
OH I COULD REVEAL A GOODLY SECRET
AND THAT SHE WOULD MOST JOYFULLY HAVE ENTERTAINED THAT SAD AND LONELY MOTHER AT HER FIRESIDE
THOU MUST GATHER THINE OWN SUNSHINE
THE MINISTER ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NEVER GONE THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE CALCULATED TO LEAD HIM BEYOND THE SCOPE OF GENERALLY RECEIVED LAWS
NOR WAS IT WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE REGRET AND SHAME THAT ACCORDING TO A REASONABLE CALCULATION OF CHANCES I SAW MY OWN PROSPECT OF RETAINING OFFICE TO BE BETTER THAN THOSE OF MY DEMOCRATIC BRETHREN
AND THERE WAS LITTLE PEARL ALL THIS WHILE HOLDING HER MOTHER'S HAND IN BOTH HER OWN AND TURNING HER FACE UPWARD WHILE SHE PUT THESE SEARCHING QUESTIONS ONCE AND AGAIN AND STILL A THIRD TIME
SO THAT OFTENTIMES SHE COULD SCARCELY REFRAIN YET ALWAYS DID REFRAIN FROM COVERING THE SYMBOL WITH HER HAND
THE BETTER PART OF MY COMPANION'S CHARACTER IF IT HAVE A BETTER PART IS THAT WHICH USUALLY COMES UPPERMOST IN MY REGARD AND FORMS THE TYPE WHEREBY I RECOGNISE THE MAN
AND HOW THIS UGLY BLACK MAN OFFERS HIS BOOK AND AN IRON PEN TO EVERYBODY THAT MEETS HIM HERE AMONG THE TREES
SHE CLUTCHED THE CHILD SO FIERCELY TO HER BREAST THAT IT SENT FORTH A CRY
AS WITH ONE PASSION SO WITH ANOTHER
HE BETRAYED ME
IT IS OF MOMENT TO HER SOUL AND THEREFORE AS THE WORSHIPFUL GOVERNOR SAYS MOMENTOUS TO THINE OWN IN WHOSE CHARGE HERS IS
HE MIGHT HAVE SAID TO THE FRIENDS WHO GREETED HIM--"I AM NOT THE MAN FOR WHOM YOU TAKE ME
SHE SEEMED RATHER AN AIRY SPRITE WHICH AFTER PLAYING ITS FANTASTIC SPORTS FOR A LITTLE WHILE UPON THE COTTAGE FLOOR WOULD FLIT AWAY WITH A MOCKING SMILE
MEANWHILE THE PRESS HAD TAKEN UP MY AFFAIR AND KEPT ME FOR A WEEK OR TWO CAREERING THROUGH THE PUBLIC PRINTS IN MY DECAPITATED STATE LIKE IRVING'S HEADLESS HORSEMAN GHASTLY AND GRIM AND LONGING TO BE BURIED AS A POLITICAL DEAD MAN OUGHT
THEN FLINGING THE ALREADY WRITTEN PAGES OF THE ELECTION SERMON INTO THE FIRE HE FORTHWITH BEGAN ANOTHER WHICH HE WROTE WITH SUCH AN IMPULSIVE FLOW OF THOUGHT AND EMOTION THAT HE FANCIED HIMSELF INSPIRED
SHE RECOGNISES BELIEVE ME THE SOLEMN MIRACLE WHICH GOD HATH WROUGHT IN THE EXISTENCE OF THAT CHILD
IT MAY BE LESS SOOTHING THAN A SINLESS CONSCIENCE
NOW AT THE DEATH-HOUR HE STANDS UP BEFORE YOU
ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF AS TO SUCH POINTS NEARLY OR ALTOGETHER AS MUCH LICENSE AS IF THE FACTS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OF MY OWN INVENTION
THE TRYING NATURE OF HIS POSITION DROVE THE BLOOD FROM HIS CHEEK AND MADE HIS LIPS TREMULOUS
THE THOUGHT SUFFICES THEM WITHOUT INVESTING ITSELF IN THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF ACTION
HAD SHE FALLEN AMONG THIEVES IT WOULD HAVE KEPT HER SAFE
GENERAL MILLER WAS RADICALLY CONSERVATIVE
NEVER WAS THERE A MORE BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MAJESTY OF AGE AND WISDOM MAY COMPORT WITH THE OBEISANCE AND RESPECT ENJOINED UPON IT AS FROM A LOWER SOCIAL RANK AND INFERIOR ORDER OF ENDOWMENT TOWARDS A HIGHER
THE FIGURE OF THAT FIRST ANCESTOR INVESTED BY FAMILY TRADITION WITH A DIM AND DUSKY GRANDEUR WAS PRESENT TO MY BOYISH IMAGINATION AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER
NOR DO I--WHOM THE SCARLET LETTER HAS DISCIPLINED TO TRUTH THOUGH IT BE THE TRUTH OF RED-HOT IRON ENTERING INTO THE SOUL--NOR DO I PERCEIVE SUCH ADVANTAGE IN HIS LIVING ANY LONGER A LIFE OF GHASTLY EMPTINESS THAT I SHALL STOOP TO IMPLORE THY MERCY
IT MAY SERVE LET US HOPE TO SYMBOLISE SOME SWEET MORAL BLOSSOM THAT MAY BE FOUND ALONG THE TRACK OR RELIEVE THE DARKENING CLOSE OF A TALE OF HUMAN FRAILTY AND SORROW
THIS IS ALREADY THE BETTER LIFE
THEN SHE MIGHT HAVE COME DOWN TO US IN HISTORY HAND IN HAND WITH ANN HUTCHINSON AS THE FOUNDRESS OF A RELIGIOUS SECT
THE FOUNDERS OF THE GREATER PART OF THE FAMILIES WHICH NOW COMPOSE THE ARISTOCRACY OF SALEM MIGHT HERE BE TRACED FROM THE PETTY AND OBSCURE BEGINNINGS OF THEIR TRAFFIC AT PERIODS GENERALLY MUCH POSTERIOR TO THE REVOLUTION UPWARD TO WHAT THEIR CHILDREN LOOK UPON AS LONG-ESTABLISHED RANK
SO PEARL--THE ELF CHILD--THE DEMON OFFSPRING AS SOME PEOPLE UP TO THAT EPOCH PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER--BECAME THE RICHEST HEIRESS OF HER DAY IN THE NEW WORLD
IT WAS ALMOST INTOLERABLE TO BE BORNE
AS REGARDED THE SHIPMASTER HOWEVER ALL WAS LOOKED UPON AS PERTAINING TO THE CHARACTER AS TO A FISH HIS GLISTENING SCALES
WOULDST THOU AVENGE THYSELF ON THE INNOCENT BABE WHISPERED SHE
ALL WERE CHARACTERISED BY THE STERNNESS AND SEVERITY WHICH OLD PORTRAITS SO INVARIABLY PUT ON AS IF THEY WERE THE GHOSTS RATHER THAN THE PICTURES OF DEPARTED WORTHIES AND WERE GAZING WITH HARSH AND INTOLERANT CRITICISM AT THE PURSUITS AND ENJOYMENTS OF LIVING MEN
THE EFFECT OF THE SYMBOL--OR RATHER OF THE POSITION IN RESPECT TO SOCIETY THAT WAS INDICATED BY IT--ON THE MIND OF HESTER PRYNNE HERSELF WAS POWERFUL AND PECULIAR
AND EVER AFTER SUCH AN OUTPOURING OH WHAT A RELIEF HAVE I WITNESSED IN THOSE SINFUL BRETHREN
REMINISCENCES THE MOST TRIFLING AND IMMATERIAL PASSAGES OF INFANCY AND SCHOOL-DAYS SPORTS CHILDISH QUARRELS AND THE LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAITS OF HER MAIDEN YEARS CAME SWARMING BACK UPON HER INTERMINGLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF WHATEVER WAS GRAVEST IN HER SUBSEQUENT LIFE
THE SPELL SURVIVES AND JUST AS POWERFULLY AS IF THE NATAL SPOT WERE AN EARTHLY PARADISE
THERE IS NO OTHER CAUSE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD IS ON ME ANSWERED THE CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN PRIEST
YET ALL THIS WHICH WOULD ELSE HAVE BEEN SUCH HEAVY SORROW WAS MADE ALMOST A SOLEMN JOY TO HER DEVOUT OLD SOUL BY RELIGIOUS CONSOLATIONS AND THE TRUTHS OF SCRIPTURE WHEREWITH SHE HAD FED HERSELF CONTINUALLY FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS
PEARL CHAPTER VII
WHAT IS HE MURMURS ONE GREY SHADOW OF MY FOREFATHERS TO THE OTHER
THE FATHER OF TWENTY CHILDREN MOST OF WHOM AT EVERY AGE OF CHILDHOOD OR MATURITY HAD LIKEWISE RETURNED TO DUST
WONDROUS STRENGTH AND GENEROSITY OF A WOMAN'S HEART
THE AUTHORITY WHICH WE HAVE CHIEFLY FOLLOWED--A MANUSCRIPT OF OLD DATE DRAWN UP FROM THE VERBAL TESTIMONY OF INDIVIDUALS SOME OF WHOM HAD KNOWN HESTER PRYNNE WHILE OTHERS HAD HEARD THE TALE FROM CONTEMPORARY WITNESSES FULLY CONFIRMS THE VIEW TAKEN IN THE FOREGOING PAGES
BUT SOMETIMES ONCE IN MANY DAYS OR PERCHANCE IN MANY MONTHS SHE FELT AN EYE--A HUMAN EYE--UPON THE IGNOMINIOUS BRAND THAT SEEMED TO GIVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF AS IF HALF OF HER AGONY WERE SHARED
YOU SIR OF ALL MEN WHOM I HAVE KNOWN ARE HE WHOSE BODY IS THE CLOSEST CONJOINED AND IMBUED AND IDENTIFIED SO TO SPEAK WITH THE SPIRIT WHEREOF IT IS THE INSTRUMENT THEN I NEED ASK NO FURTHER SAID THE CLERGYMAN SOMEWHAT HASTILY RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
SO THEY LINGERED AN INSTANT LONGER
BUT THEY WERE UTTERED ONLY WITHIN HIS IMAGINATION
WOMAN IT IS THY BADGE OF SHAME REPLIED THE STERN MAGISTRATE
WITH WHAT A GHASTLY RAPTURE AS IT WERE TOO MIGHTY TO BE EXPRESSED ONLY BY THE EYE AND FEATURES AND THEREFORE BURSTING FORTH THROUGH THE WHOLE UGLINESS OF HIS FIGURE AND MAKING ITSELF EVEN RIOTOUSLY MANIFEST BY THE EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES WITH WHICH HE THREW UP HIS ARMS TOWARDS THE CEILING AND STAMPED HIS FOOT UPON THE FLOOR
DOST THOU MOCK ME NOW SAID THE MINISTER
MUCH LESS WOULD HE HAVE EXCLUDED ALL OTHER OBJECTS AND IDEAS FROM HER MIND
HESTER CRIED HE HERE IS A NEW HORROR
AND PUTTING UP HER LITTLE HAND SHE GRASPED AT IT SMILING NOT DOUBTFULLY BUT WITH A DECIDED GLEAM THAT GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A MUCH OLDER CHILD
WHAT I SAW IN HIM--AS EVIDENTLY AS THE INDESTRUCTIBLE RAMPARTS OF OLD TICONDEROGA ALREADY CITED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SIMILE--WAS THE FEATURES OF STUBBORN AND PONDEROUS ENDURANCE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE AMOUNTED TO OBSTINACY IN HIS EARLIER DAYS
IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AS BEFORE IN THE OLD MANSE I HAD SPENT THREE YEARS--A TERM LONG ENOUGH TO REST A WEARY BRAIN
AND IF IN ANY OF HER CHANGES SHE HAD GROWN FAINTER OR PALER SHE WOULD HAVE CEASED TO BE HERSELF--IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO LONGER PEARL
IT WAS BETTER TO STAND THUS WITH SO MANY BETWIXT HIM AND HER THAN TO GREET HIM FACE TO FACE--THEY TWO ALONE
NEVERTHELESS I CANNOT ANSWER FOR HER
NO LIFE HAD BEEN MORE PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT THAN MINE
WHICH WOULD NOT FAIL TO BE DISTRIBUTED IN STRICT ACCORDANCE AND PROPORTION WITH THE INTIMACY AND SACREDNESS OF THEIR PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP
THIS FLITTING CHEERFULNESS WAS ALWAYS AT THE FURTHER EXTREMITY OF SOME LONG VISTA THROUGH THE FOREST
WRITE
AS FOR LITTLE PEARL THE EARNESTNESS SOON PASSED OUT OF HER FACE
THE WINE OF LIFE HENCEFORTH TO BE PRESENTED TO HER LIPS MUST BE INDEED RICH DELICIOUS AND EXHILARATING IN ITS CHASED AND GOLDEN BEAKER OR ELSE LEAVE AN INEVITABLE AND WEARY LANGUOR AFTER THE LEES OF BITTERNESS WHEREWITH SHE HAD BEEN DRUGGED AS WITH A CORDIAL OF INTENSEST POTENCY
CONTINUALLY AND IN A THOUSAND OTHER WAYS DID SHE FEEL THE INNUMERABLE THROBS OF ANGUISH THAT HAD BEEN SO CUNNINGLY CONTRIVED FOR HER BY THE UNDYING THE EVER-ACTIVE SENTENCE OF THE PURITAN TRIBUNAL
BUT IT IS TIME TO QUIT THIS SKETCH
THEN ENSUED A MURMUR AND HALF-HUSHED TUMULT AS IF THE AUDITORS RELEASED FROM THE HIGH SPELL THAT HAD TRANSPORTED THEM INTO THE REGION OF ANOTHER'S MIND WERE RETURNING INTO THEMSELVES WITH ALL THEIR AWE AND WONDER STILL HEAVY ON THEM
HE WOULD PROBABLY RETURN BY A CERTAIN HOUR IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE MORROW
COULDST THOU SURELY TELL HESTER WHETHER HE WAS THE SAME MAN THAT ENCOUNTERED THEE ON THE FOREST PATH MADAM I KNOW NOT OF WHAT YOU SPEAK ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE FEELING MISTRESS HIBBINS TO BE OF INFIRM MIND
METHINKS I HAVE SEEN JUST SUCH FIGURES WHEN THE SUN HAS BEEN SHINING THROUGH A RICHLY PAINTED WINDOW AND TRACING OUT THE GOLDEN AND CRIMSON IMAGES ACROSS THE FLOOR
BUT THE MINISTER HELD IT FAST
ONE GLANCE OF RECOGNITION SHE HAD IMAGINED MUST NEEDS PASS BETWEEN THEM
THIS AIRY HALL THEREFORE OVER THE COLLECTOR'S APARTMENTS REMAINS UNFINISHED TO THIS DAY AND IN SPITE OF THE AGED COBWEBS THAT FESTOON ITS DUSKY BEAMS APPEARS STILL TO AWAIT THE LABOUR OF THE CARPENTER AND MASON
THE CUSTOM-HOUSE CHAPTER I
THIS FAITH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE STEALS THE PITH AND AVAILABILITY OUT OF WHATEVER ENTERPRISE HE MAY DREAM OF UNDERTAKING
THERE WERE MEN AMONG THEM IN THEIR STRENGTH AND PRIME OF MARKED ABILITY AND ENERGY AND ALTOGETHER SUPERIOR TO THE SLUGGISH AND DEPENDENT MODE OF LIFE ON WHICH THEIR EVIL STARS HAD CAST THEM
BUT I COULD IMAGINE EVEN THEN THAT UNDER SOME EXCITEMENT WHICH SHOULD GO DEEPLY INTO HIS CONSCIOUSNESS--ROUSED BY A TRUMPET'S PEAL LOUD ENOUGH TO AWAKEN ALL OF HIS ENERGIES THAT WERE NOT DEAD BUT ONLY SLUMBERING--HE WAS YET CAPABLE OF FLINGING OFF HIS INFIRMITIES LIKE A SICK MAN'S GOWN DROPPING THE STAFF OF AGE TO SEIZE A BATTLE-SWORD AND STARTING UP ONCE MORE A WARRIOR
PEARL IN UTTER SCORN OF HER MOTHER'S ATTEMPT TO QUIET HER GAVE AN ELDRITCH SCREAM AND THEN BECAME SILENT NOT FROM ANY NOTION OF OBEDIENCE BUT BECAUSE THE QUICK AND MOBILE CURIOSITY OF HER DISPOSITION WAS EXCITED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THOSE NEW PERSONAGES
YOU SHOULD STUDY LESS GOOD SIR AND TAKE A LITTLE PASTIME OR THESE NIGHT WHIMSIES WILL GROW UPON YOU I WILL GO HOME WITH YOU SAID MR DIMMESDALE
IT WAS PERCEIVED TOO THAT WHILE HESTER NEVER PUT FORWARD EVEN THE HUMBLEST TITLE TO SHARE IN THE WORLD'S PRIVILEGES--FURTHER THAN TO BREATHE THE COMMON AIR AND EARN DAILY BREAD FOR LITTLE PEARL AND HERSELF BY THE FAITHFUL LABOUR OF HER HANDS--SHE WAS QUICK TO ACKNOWLEDGE HER SISTERHOOD WITH THE RACE OF MAN WHENEVER BENEFITS WERE TO BE CONFERRED
AND THESE FAMILIAR ONES IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID WILL DO JUST AS WELL WITHOUT ME
ARE MY PURPOSES WONT TO BE SO SHALLOW
CARRIED AWAY BY THE GROTESQUE HORROR OF THIS PICTURE THE MINISTER UNAWARES AND TO HIS OWN INFINITE ALARM BURST INTO A GREAT PEAL OF LAUGHTER
I AM BUT A CHILD
AND MY CHILD MUST SEEK A HEAVENLY FATHER
IT STOOD NEARLY BENEATH THE EAVES OF BOSTON'S EARLIEST CHURCH AND APPEARED TO BE A FIXTURE THERE
AND QUAFFING AT THEIR PLEASURE DRAUGHTS OF WINE OR AQUA-VITAE FROM POCKET FLASKS WHICH THEY FREELY TENDERED TO THE GAPING CROWD AROUND THEM
THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT CHAPTER XI
SHE MET HIS EYES FOR AN INSTANT BUT WAS IMMEDIATELY CONSTRAINED TO GIVE ALL HER ATTENTION TO THE SCENE NOW GOING FORWARD
MY EYES FASTENED THEMSELVES UPON THE OLD SCARLET LETTER AND WOULD NOT BE TURNED ASIDE
CRIME IS FOR THE IRON-NERVED WHO HAVE THEIR CHOICE EITHER TO ENDURE IT OR IF IT PRESS TOO HARD TO EXERT THEIR FIERCE AND SAVAGE STRENGTH FOR A GOOD PURPOSE AND FLING IT OFF AT ONCE
SO ROGER CHILLINGWORTH--THE MAN OF SKILL THE KIND AND FRIENDLY PHYSICIAN--STROVE TO GO DEEP INTO HIS PATIENT'S BOSOM DELVING AMONG HIS PRINCIPLES PRYING INTO HIS RECOLLECTIONS AND PROBING EVERYTHING WITH A CAUTIOUS TOUCH LIKE A TREASURE-SEEKER IN A DARK CAVERN
BUT DOST THOU KNOW MY CHILD WHAT THIS LETTER MEANS WHICH THY MOTHER IS DOOMED TO WEAR YES MOTHER SAID THE CHILD
THIS IS MOST FORTUNATE HE HAD THEN SAID TO HIMSELF
SUCH WAS HIS SENSE OF POWER OVER THIS VIRGIN SOUL TRUSTING HIM AS SHE DID THAT THE MINISTER FELT POTENT TO BLIGHT ALL THE FIELD OF INNOCENCE WITH BUT ONE WICKED LOOK AND DEVELOP ALL ITS OPPOSITE WITH BUT A WORD
IT SHOWED THE FAMILIAR SCENE OF THE STREET WITH THE DISTINCTNESS OF MID-DAY BUT ALSO WITH THE AWFULNESS THAT IS ALWAYS IMPARTED TO FAMILIAR OBJECTS BY AN UNACCUSTOMED LIGHT
IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THAT HE HAD GROWN OLDER
ITS COLOURS AND SHADOWS ARE MARVELOUSLY REFLECTED IN HIS TWICE-TOLD TALES AND OTHER SHORT STORIES THE PRODUCT OF HIS FIRST LITERARY PERIOD
NEVERTHELESS TIME WENT ON
I HARDLY COMPREHEND HER
XXIV
DETECTING THE GLEAM OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S LAMP THE OLD LADY QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED HER OWN AND VANISHED
THAT SAINT ON EARTH AS THE PEOPLE UPHOLD HIM TO BE AND AS--I MUST NEEDS SAY--HE REALLY LOOKS
NOW IT WAS A HERD OF DIABOLIC SHAPES THAT GRINNED AND MOCKED AT THE PALE MINISTER AND BECKONED HIM AWAY WITH THEM
SHAME DESPAIR SOLITUDE
MY ONE SUFFICIENT OBJECT WAS TO GREET THAT PIOUS FRIEND OF MINE THE APOSTLE ELIOT AND REJOICE WITH HIM OVER THE MANY PRECIOUS SOULS HE HATH WON FROM HEATHENDOM HA HA HA CACKLED THE OLD WITCH-LADY STILL NODDING HER HIGH HEAD-DRESS AT THE MINISTER
ALL THAT THEY LACKED WAS THE GIFT THAT DESCENDED UPON THE CHOSEN DISCIPLES AT PENTECOST IN TONGUES OF FLAME
BUT IT WAS A REMARKABLE ATTRIBUTE OF THIS GARB AND INDEED OF THE CHILD'S WHOLE APPEARANCE THAT IT IRRESISTIBLY AND INEVITABLY REMINDED THE BEHOLDER OF THE TOKEN WHICH HESTER PRYNNE WAS DOOMED TO WEAR UPON HER BOSOM
BECAUSE THENCEFORWARD NO GOOD CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THEM
WHY WHAT IS THIS MOTHER CRIED SHE
HER MOTHER IN CONTRIVING THE CHILD'S GARB HAD ALLOWED THE GORGEOUS TENDENCIES OF HER IMAGINATION THEIR FULL PLAY ARRAYING HER IN A CRIMSON VELVET TUNIC OF A PECULIAR CUT ABUNDANTLY EMBROIDERED IN FANTASIES AND FLOURISHES OF GOLD THREAD
THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF AN ELABORATE RUFF BENEATH HIS GREY BEARD IN THE ANTIQUATED FASHION OF KING JAMES'S REIGN CAUSED HIS HEAD TO LOOK NOT A LITTLE LIKE THAT OF JOHN THE BAPTIST IN A CHARGER
THROWING HIS EYES ANXIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICE HE INDISTINCTLY BEHELD A FORM UNDER THE TREES CLAD IN GARMENTS SO SOMBRE AND SO LITTLE RELIEVED FROM THE GRAY TWILIGHT INTO WHICH THE CLOUDED SKY AND THE HEAVY FOLIAGE HAD DARKENED THE NOONTIDE THAT HE KNEW NOT WHETHER IT WERE A WOMAN OR A SHADOW
THE TREES IMPENDING OVER IT HAD FLUNG DOWN GREAT BRANCHES FROM TIME TO TIME WHICH CHOKED UP THE CURRENT AND COMPELLED IT TO FORM EDDIES AND BLACK DEPTHS AT SOME POINTS
TO OBSERVE AND DEFINE HIS CHARACTER HOWEVER UNDER SUCH DISADVANTAGES WAS AS DIFFICULT A TASK AS TO TRACE OUT AND BUILD UP ANEW IN IMAGINATION AN OLD FORTRESS LIKE TICONDEROGA FROM A VIEW OF ITS GREY AND BROKEN RUINS
NOW SHE CAUGHT THE LOW UNDERTONE AS OF THE WIND SINKING DOWN TO REPOSE ITSELF
WILL IT PLEASE YOU THEREFORE TO TELL ME OF HESTER PRYNNE'S--HAVE I HER NAME RIGHTLY?--OF THIS WOMAN'S OFFENCES AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT HER TO YONDER SCAFFOLD TRULY FRIEND
AND SO HE SAW NOTHING HEARD NOTHING KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS AROUND HIM
BUT IN SPITE OF THIS OUTWARD SHOW THE LATTER WAS ALMOST CONVINCED OF THE OLD MAN'S KNOWLEDGE OR AT LEAST HIS CONFIDENT SUSPICION WITH RESPECT TO HIS OWN INTERVIEW WITH HESTER PRYNNE
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE STAIN WHICH THAT LETTER INDICATES THAT WE WOULD TRANSFER THY CHILD TO OTHER HANDS NEVERTHELESS SAID THE MOTHER CALMLY THOUGH GROWING MORE PALE THIS BADGE HATH TAUGHT ME--IT DAILY TEACHES ME--IT IS TEACHING ME AT THIS MOMENT--LESSONS WHEREOF MY CHILD MAY BE THE WISER AND BETTER ALBEIT THEY CAN PROFIT NOTHING TO MYSELF WE WILL JUDGE WARILY SAID BELLINGHAM AND LOOK WELL WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO
THIS IMAGE SO NEARLY IDENTICAL WITH THE LIVING PEARL SEEMED TO COMMUNICATE SOMEWHAT OF ITS OWN SHADOWY AND INTANGIBLE QUALITY TO THE CHILD HERSELF
THE CHIEF TRAGIC EVENT OF THE OLD MAN'S LIFE SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE WAS HIS MISHAP WITH A CERTAIN GOOSE WHICH LIVED AND DIED SOME TWENTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO
SHE DID NOT WEIGH UPON ITS SYMPATHIES
I AM A CITIZEN OF SOMEWHERE ELSE
A FEW HOURS LONGER AND THE DEEP MYSTERIOUS OCEAN WILL QUENCH AND HIDE FOR EVER THE SYMBOL WHICH YE HAVE CAUSED TO BURN ON HER BOSOM NOR WERE IT AN INCONSISTENCY TOO IMPROBABLE TO BE ASSIGNED TO HUMAN NATURE SHOULD WE SUPPOSE A FEELING OF REGRET IN HESTER'S MIND AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO WIN HER FREEDOM FROM THE PAIN WHICH HAD BEEN THUS DEEPLY INCORPORATED WITH HER BEING
O EXQUISITE RELIEF
TWICE-TOLD TALES 1ST SERIES 1837
IT WAS A LAST YEAR'S NUT AND ALREADY GNAWED BY HIS SHARP TOOTH
IT MAY SEEM MARVELLOUS THAT WITH THE WORLD BEFORE HER--KEPT BY NO RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE OF HER CONDEMNATION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PURITAN SETTLEMENT SO REMOTE AND SO OBSCURE--FREE TO RETURN TO HER BIRTH-PLACE OR TO ANY OTHER EUROPEAN LAND AND THERE HIDE HER CHARACTER AND IDENTITY UNDER A NEW EXTERIOR AS COMPLETELY AS IF EMERGING INTO ANOTHER STATE OF BEING--AND HAVING ALSO THE PASSES OF THE DARK INSCRUTABLE FOREST OPEN TO HER WHERE THE WILDNESS OF HER NATURE MIGHT ASSIMILATE ITSELF WITH A PEOPLE WHOSE CUSTOMS AND LIFE WERE ALIEN FROM THE LAW THAT HAD CONDEMNED HER--IT MAY SEEM MARVELLOUS THAT THIS WOMAN SHOULD STILL CALL THAT PLACE HER HOME WHERE AND WHERE ONLY SHE MUST NEEDS BE THE TYPE OF SHAME
I SEEM TO HAVE FLUNG MYSELF--SICK SIN-STAINED AND SORROW-BLACKENED--DOWN UPON THESE FOREST LEAVES AND TO HAVE RISEN UP ALL MADE ANEW AND WITH NEW POWERS TO GLORIFY HIM THAT HATH BEEN MERCIFUL
THY HEART MUST BE NO LONGER UNDER HIS EVIL EYE IT WERE FAR WORSE THAN DEATH REPLIED THE MINISTER
TAKING UPON HERSELF LIKEWISE TO GIVE ADVICE IN ALL MATTERS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE HEART BY WHICH MEANS--AS A PERSON OF SUCH PROPENSITIES INEVITABLY MUST--SHE GAINED FROM MANY PEOPLE THE REVERENCE DUE TO AN ANGEL BUT I SHOULD IMAGINE WAS LOOKED UPON BY OTHERS AS AN INTRUDER AND A NUISANCE
THAT OLD MAN!--THE PHYSICIAN!--HE WHOM THEY CALL ROGER CHILLINGWORTH!--HE WAS MY HUSBAND THE MINISTER LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT WITH ALL THAT VIOLENCE OF PASSION WHICH--INTERMIXED IN MORE SHAPES THAN ONE WITH HIS HIGHER PURER SOFTER QUALITIES--WAS IN FACT THE PORTION OF HIM WHICH THE DEVIL CLAIMED AND THROUGH WHICH HE SOUGHT TO WIN THE REST
DAMES OF ELEVATED RANK LIKEWISE WHOSE DOORS SHE ENTERED IN THE WAY OF HER OCCUPATION WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DISTIL DROPS OF BITTERNESS INTO HER HEART
BEFORE THIS UGLY EDIFICE AND BETWEEN IT AND THE WHEEL-TRACK OF THE STREET WAS A GRASS-PLOT MUCH OVERGROWN WITH BURDOCK PIG-WEED APPLE-PERN AND SUCH UNSIGHTLY VEGETATION WHICH EVIDENTLY FOUND SOMETHING CONGENIAL IN THE SOIL THAT HAD SO EARLY BORNE THE BLACK FLOWER OF CIVILISED SOCIETY A PRISON
WHAT WOULDST THOU SAY CHILD ASKED MR DIMMESDALE
YET STRANGELY STARTLED AND AWE-STRICKEN BY THE CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH SHE AFFIRMED A PERSONAL CONNEXION BETWEEN SO MANY PERSONS HERSELF AMONG THEM AND THE EVIL ONE
HIS VOICE THOUGH STILL RICH AND SWEET HAD A CERTAIN MELANCHOLY PROPHECY OF DECAY IN IT
INTERPRETING HESTER PRYNNE'S DEPORTMENT AS AN APPEAL OF THIS NATURE SOCIETY WAS INCLINED TO SHOW ITS FORMER VICTIM A MORE BENIGN COUNTENANCE THAN SHE CARED TO BE FAVOURED WITH OR PERCHANCE THAN SHE DESERVED
AN IRRESISTIBLE FEELING KEPT HESTER NEAR THE SPOT
EXTERNALLY THE JOLLITY OF AGED MEN HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH THE MIRTH OF CHILDREN
FEW OF MY COUNTRYMEN CAN KNOW WHAT IT IS
THE LITTLE POWER YOU MIGHT HAVE ONCE POSSESSED OVER THE TRIBE OF UNREALITIES IS GONE
AND WHY DOES THE MINISTER KEEP HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART WHAT SHALL I SAY THOUGHT HESTER TO HERSELF
SHE HAD NOT THE DISEASE OF SADNESS WHICH ALMOST ALL CHILDREN IN THESE LATTER DAYS INHERIT WITH THE SCROFULA FROM THE TROUBLES OF THEIR ANCESTORS
HE HAD ALL THE PURITANIC TRAITS BOTH GOOD AND EVIL
NOT TO SPEAK OF THE CLERGYMAN'S HEALTH SO INADEQUATE TO SUSTAIN THE HARDSHIPS OF A FOREST LIFE HIS NATIVE GIFTS HIS CULTURE AND HIS ENTIRE DEVELOPMENT WOULD SECURE HIM A HOME ONLY IN THE MIDST OF CIVILIZATION AND REFINEMENT
THERE WAS A SWORD AT HIS SIDE AND A SWORD-CUT ON HIS FOREHEAD WHICH BY THE ARRANGEMENT OF HIS HAIR HE SEEMED ANXIOUS RATHER TO DISPLAY THAN HIDE
IN HIS PORT WAS THE DIGNITY OF ONE WHO HAD BORNE HIS MAJESTY'S COMMISSION AND WHO WAS THEREFORE ILLUMINATED BY A RAY OF THE SPLENDOUR THAT SHONE SO DAZZLINGLY ABOUT THE THRONE
NOR WAS PEARL THE ONLY CHILD TO WHOM THIS INAUSPICIOUS ORIGIN WAS ASSIGNED AMONG THE NEW ENGLAND PURITANS
THIS EXPRESSION WAS INVISIBLE IN MR DIMMESDALE'S PRESENCE BUT GREW STRONGLY EVIDENT AS THE PHYSICIAN CROSSED THE THRESHOLD
IT BROUGHT THEE HITHER
COME THOU INTO THE POOL AND PEARL STEPPING IN MID-LEG DEEP BEHELD HER OWN WHITE FEET AT THE BOTTOM
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON THE FOURTH DAY FROM THE PRESENT
FOR IN AN INSTITUTION LIKE THIS WHERE ITS OFFICERS ARE APPOINTED TO SUBSERVE THEIR OWN PROFIT AND CONVENIENCE AND SELDOM WITH A LEADING REFERENCE TO THEIR FITNESS FOR THE DUTY TO BE PERFORMED THEY MUST PERFORCE SEEK ELSEWHERE THE DEXTERITY WHICH IS NOT IN THEM
WE MAY ALL SEE IT IN THE SUNSHINE
SHE LOOKED ALSO AT HER SLUMBERING CHILD
THE SCARLET LETTER 1850
LARGE BROWN MELANCHOLY EYES AND A MOUTH WHICH UNLESS WHEN HE FORCIBLY COMPRESSED IT WAS APT TO BE TREMULOUS EXPRESSING BOTH NERVOUS SENSIBILITY AND A VAST POWER OF SELF RESTRAINT
IT WAS NOT SO MUCH A BETTER PRINCIPLE AS PARTLY HIS NATURAL GOOD TASTE AND STILL MORE HIS BUCKRAMED HABIT OF CLERICAL DECORUM THAT CARRIED HIM SAFELY THROUGH THE LATTER CRISIS
IT MIGHT BE TOO--DOUBTLESS IT WAS SO ALTHOUGH SHE HID THE SECRET FROM HERSELF AND GREW PALE WHENEVER IT STRUGGLED OUT OF HER HEART LIKE A SERPENT FROM ITS HOLE--IT MIGHT BE THAT ANOTHER FEELING KEPT HER WITHIN THE SCENE AND PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL
INTO THIS FESTAL SEASON OF THE YEAR--AS IT ALREADY WAS AND CONTINUED TO BE DURING THE GREATER PART OF TWO CENTURIES--THE PURITANS COMPRESSED WHATEVER MIRTH AND PUBLIC JOY THEY DEEMED ALLOWABLE TO HUMAN INFIRMITY
I HAVE NONE TO GIVE THEE THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE-WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
AND HE HIMSELF IN SO FAR AS HE SHOWS HIMSELF IN A FALSE LIGHT BECOMES A SHADOW OR INDEED CEASES TO EXIST
HERE THEN WAS A WIDE AND REASONABLY LOFTY HALL EXTENDING THROUGH THE WHOLE DEPTH OF THE HOUSE AND FORMING A MEDIUM OF GENERAL COMMUNICATION MORE OR LESS DIRECTLY WITH ALL THE OTHER APARTMENTS
MEN OF UNCOMMON INTELLECT WHO HAVE GROWN MORBID POSSESS THIS OCCASIONAL POWER OF MIGHTY EFFORT INTO WHICH THEY THROW THE LIFE OF MANY DAYS AND THEN ARE LIFELESS FOR AS MANY MORE
IT WAS HELD TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE MEASURE FOR THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN'S WELFARE
THERE CAN BE IF I FORBODE ARIGHT NO POWER SHORT OF THE DIVINE MERCY TO DISCLOSE WHETHER BY UTTERED WORDS OR BY TYPE OR EMBLEM THE SECRETS THAT MAY BE BURIED IN THE HUMAN HEART
BUT ON THIS OCCASION UP TO THE MOMENT OF PUTTING HIS LIPS TO THE OLD WOMAN'S EAR MR DIMMESDALE AS THE GREAT ENEMY OF SOULS WOULD HAVE IT COULD RECALL NO TEXT OF SCRIPTURE NOR AUGHT ELSE EXCEPT A BRIEF PITHY AND AS IT THEN APPEARED TO HIM UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE IMMORTALITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL
IN WHICH EVERY REMEDY CONTAINED A MULTITUDE OF FAR-FETCHED AND HETEROGENEOUS INGREDIENTS AS ELABORATELY COMPOUNDED AS IF THE PROPOSED RESULT HAD BEEN THE ELIXIR OF LIFE
PLUCK UP A SPIRIT AND DO NOT BE ALL THE TIME SIGHING AND MURMURING BUT THE BROOK IN THE COURSE OF ITS LITTLE LIFETIME AMONG THE FOREST TREES HAD GONE THROUGH SO SOLEMN AN EXPERIENCE THAT IT COULD NOT HELP TALKING ABOUT IT AND SEEMED TO HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY
MUFFLED AS THE SOUND WAS BY ITS PASSAGE THROUGH THE CHURCH WALLS HESTER PRYNNE LISTENED WITH SUCH INTENSENESS AND SYMPATHIZED SO INTIMATELY THAT THE SERMON HAD THROUGHOUT A MEANING FOR HER ENTIRELY APART FROM ITS INDISTINGUISHABLE WORDS
A SMILE WHICH--ACROSS THE WIDE AND BUSTLING SQUARE AND THROUGH ALL THE TALK AND LAUGHTER AND VARIOUS THOUGHTS MOODS AND INTERESTS OF THE CROWD--CONVEYED SECRET AND FEARFUL MEANING
AT TIMES A FEARFUL DOUBT STROVE TO POSSESS HER SOUL WHETHER IT WERE NOT BETTER TO SEND PEARL AT ONCE TO HEAVEN AND GO HERSELF TO SUCH FUTURITY AS ETERNAL JUSTICE SHOULD PROVIDE
YET A LITTLE WHILE AND SHE WILL BE BEYOND YOUR REACH
A NEW THOUGHT HAD STRUCK HIM
THEN SHE WAS SURE OF HER AND TASTED HOURS OF QUIET SAD DELICIOUS HAPPINESS
IT WAS LIKE NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE PHANTASMAGORIC PLAY OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
AND THERE STOOD THE MINISTER WITH HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
NOT SO WITH OUR OLD INSPECTOR
WITH A HAND'S-BREADTH FURTHER FLIGHT IT WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE WATER AND HAVE GIVEN THE LITTLE BROOK ANOTHER WOE TO CARRY ONWARD BESIDES THE UNINTELLIGIBLE TALE WHICH IT STILL KEPT MURMURING ABOUT
AT THAT DISTANCE THEY ACCORDINGLY STOOD FIXED THERE BY THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE OF THE REPUGNANCE WHICH THE MYSTIC SYMBOL INSPIRED
HERE WAS ANOTHER RUIN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHICH CAME PARTLY HOME TO HER
THERE SHE BEHELD ANOTHER COUNTENANCE OF A MAN WELL STRICKEN IN YEARS A PALE THIN SCHOLAR-LIKE VISAGE WITH EYES DIM AND BLEARED BY THE LAMP-LIGHT THAT HAD SERVED THEM TO PORE OVER MANY PONDEROUS BOOKS
THE POOR AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID WHOM SHE SOUGHT OUT TO BE THE OBJECTS OF HER BOUNTY OFTEN REVILED THE HAND THAT WAS STRETCHED FORTH TO SUCCOUR THEM
AND THE BEEF AND ALE OF THEIR NATIVE LAND WITH A MORAL DIET NOT A WHIT MORE REFINED ENTERED LARGELY INTO THEIR COMPOSITION
MINISTER WHISPERED LITTLE PEARL
DURING THAT TERM HE WAS TO BE THE PROPERTY OF HIS MASTER AND AS MUCH A COMMODITY OF BARGAIN AND SALE AS AN OX OR A JOINT-STOOL
THE DAY WAS CHILL AND SOMBRE
OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH KNELT DOWN BESIDE HIM WITH A BLANK DULL COUNTENANCE OUT OF WHICH THE LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE DEPARTED
NOT SO MUCH IN ITSELF NOR AS OUTWARDLY MANIFESTED,--IN SO FAR AT LEAST AS THE SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN LAID OPEN TO MY OBSERVATION
SHE SAW THE CHILDREN OF THE SETTLEMENT ON THE GRASSY MARGIN OF THE STREET OR AT THE DOMESTIC THRESHOLDS DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN SUCH GRIM FASHIONS AS THE PURITANIC NURTURE WOULD PERMIT
NOW SHE FIXED HER BRIGHT WILD EYES ON HER MOTHER NOW ON THE MINISTER AND NOW INCLUDED THEM BOTH IN THE SAME GLANCE AS IF TO DETECT AND EXPLAIN TO HERSELF THE RELATION WHICH THEY BORE TO ONE ANOTHER
THUS THEY WENT ONWARD NOT BOLDLY BUT STEP BY STEP INTO THE THEMES THAT WERE BROODING DEEPEST IN THEIR HEARTS
BUT THEN AGAIN AN ACCUSTOMED EYE HAD LIKEWISE ITS OWN ANGUISH TO INFLICT
HIS WILL BE DONE
IT IS I AND MY LITTLE PEARL WHENCE COME YOU HESTER ASKED THE MINISTER
PEARL THEREFORE--SO LARGE WERE THE ATTAINMENTS OF HER THREE YEARS LIFETIME--COULD HAVE BORNE A FAIR EXAMINATION IN THE NEW ENGLAND PRIMER OR THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE WESTMINSTER CATECHISMS ALTHOUGH UNACQUAINTED WITH THE OUTWARD FORM OF EITHER OF THOSE CELEBRATED WORKS
BEGIN ALL ANEW
BUT QUITE AS FREQUENTLY IT AWARDS MORE THAN JUSTICE WHEN THE APPEAL IS MADE AS DESPOTS LOVE TO HAVE IT MADE ENTIRELY TO ITS GENEROSITY
IT REMARKABLY CHARACTERISED THE INCOMPLETE MORALITY OF THE AGE RIGID AS WE CALL IT THAT A LICENCE WAS ALLOWED THE SEAFARING CLASS NOT MERELY FOR THEIR FREAKS ON SHORE BUT FOR FAR MORE DESPERATE DEEDS ON THEIR PROPER ELEMENT
THERE IS NO LAW NOR REVERENCE FOR AUTHORITY NO REGARD FOR HUMAN ORDINANCES OR OPINIONS RIGHT OR WRONG MIXED UP WITH THAT CHILD'S COMPOSITION REMARKED HE AS MUCH TO HIMSELF AS TO HIS COMPANION
IF HE POSSESSES AN UNUSUAL SHARE OF NATIVE ENERGY OR THE ENERVATING MAGIC OF PLACE DO NOT OPERATE TOO LONG UPON HIM HIS FORFEITED POWERS MAY BE REDEEMABLE
THIS FEEBLE AND MOST SENSITIVE OF SPIRITS COULD DO NEITHER YET CONTINUALLY DID ONE THING OR ANOTHER WHICH INTERTWINED IN THE SAME INEXTRICABLE KNOT THE AGONY OF HEAVEN-DEFYING GUILT AND VAIN REPENTANCE
AS HIS STUDIES AT A PREVIOUS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HAD MADE HIM EXTENSIVELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE MEDICAL SCIENCE OF THE DAY IT WAS AS A PHYSICIAN THAT HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AND AS SUCH WAS CORDIALLY RECEIVED
ANALYTICAL INDEX OF HAWTHORNE'S WORKS BY E
HAD EITHER OF THESE AGONIES BEEN WANTING I HAD BEEN LOST FOR EVER
AND NOW THROUGH THE CHAMBER WHICH THESE SPECTRAL THOUGHTS HAD MADE SO GHASTLY GLIDED HESTER PRYNNE LEADING ALONG LITTLE PEARL IN HER SCARLET GARB AND POINTING HER FOREFINGER FIRST AT THE SCARLET LETTER ON HER BOSOM AND THEN AT THE CLERGYMAN'S OWN BREAST
AND WHY NOT MOTHER ASKED PEARL STOPPING SHORT JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF HER RACE
THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE PRESENT FROM THE COUNTRY ROUND ABOUT WHO HAD OFTEN HEARD OF THE SCARLET LETTER AND TO WHOM IT HAD BEEN MADE TERRIFIC BY A HUNDRED FALSE OR EXAGGERATED RUMOURS BUT WHO HAD NEVER BEHELD IT WITH THEIR OWN BODILY EYES
HE WAS IN TRUTH A RARE PHENOMENON
YE HAVE BOTH BEEN HERE BEFORE BUT I WAS NOT WITH YOU
THERE CAN BE NO OUTRAGE METHINKS AGAINST OUR COMMON NATURE--WHATEVER BE THE DELINQUENCIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL--NO OUTRAGE MORE FLAGRANT THAN TO FORBID THE CULPRIT TO HIDE HIS FACE FOR SHAME
SHE SET HERSELF THEREFORE TO GATHERING VIOLETS AND WOOD-ANEMONES AND SOME SCARLET COLUMBINES THAT SHE FOUND GROWING IN THE CREVICE OF A HIGH ROCK
IT IS TOO MIGHTY FOR ME TO STRUGGLE WITH HEAVEN WOULD SHOW MERCY REJOINED HESTER HADST THOU BUT THE STRENGTH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT BE THOU STRONG FOR ME ANSWERED HE
THEY FANCIED HIM THE MOUTH-PIECE OF HEAVEN'S MESSAGES OF WISDOM AND REBUKE AND LOVE
THE PHYSICIAN KNEW THEN THAT IN THE MINISTER'S REGARD HE WAS NO LONGER A TRUSTED FRIEND BUT HIS BITTEREST ENEMY
HIS SUBJECT IT APPEARED HAD BEEN THE RELATION BETWEEN THE DEITY AND THE COMMUNITIES OF MANKIND WITH A SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NEW ENGLAND WHICH THEY WERE HERE PLANTING IN THE WILDERNESS
IT IMPRESSED ME AS IF THE ANCIENT SURVEYOR IN HIS GARB OF A HUNDRED YEARS GONE BY AND WEARING HIS IMMORTAL WIG--WHICH WAS BURIED WITH HIM BUT DID NOT PERISH IN THE GRAVE--HAD MET ME IN THE DESERTED CHAMBER OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
AFTER PUTTING HER FINGER IN HER MOUTH WITH MANY UNGRACIOUS REFUSALS TO ANSWER GOOD MR WILSON'S QUESTION THE CHILD FINALLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN MADE AT ALL BUT HAD BEEN PLUCKED BY HER MOTHER OFF THE BUSH OF WILD ROSES THAT GREW BY THE PRISON-DOOR
THIS ROSE-BUSH BY A STRANGE CHANCE HAS BEEN KEPT ALIVE IN HISTORY
AND THE PHYSICIAN KNEW IT WELL
IN THE WAY OF LITERARY TALK IT IS TRUE THE NAVAL OFFICER--AN EXCELLENT FELLOW WHO CAME INTO THE OFFICE WITH ME AND WENT OUT ONLY A LITTLE LATER--WOULD OFTEN ENGAGE ME IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT ONE OR THE OTHER OF HIS FAVOURITE TOPICS NAPOLEON OR SHAKESPEARE
HEREUPON PEARL BROKE AWAY FROM HER MOTHER AND RUNNING TO THE BROOK STOOPED OVER IT AND BATHED HER FOREHEAD UNTIL THE UNWELCOME KISS WAS QUITE WASHED OFF AND DIFFUSED THROUGH A LONG LAPSE OF THE GLIDING WATER
IT HAS AVENGED THEE ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE
THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN THEREFORE SHONE ON BROAD SHOULDERS AND WELL-DEVELOPED BUSTS AND ON ROUND AND RUDDY CHEEKS THAT HAD RIPENED IN THE FAR-OFF ISLAND AND HAD HARDLY YET GROWN PALER OR THINNER IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF NEW ENGLAND
IT SEEMED NOT SO WILD A DREAM--OLD AS I WAS AND SOMBRE AS I WAS AND MISSHAPEN AS I WAS--THAT THE SIMPLE BLISS WHICH IS SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE FOR ALL MANKIND TO GATHER UP MIGHT YET BE MINE
VIII
I MUST NEEDS LOOK DEEPER INTO IT
THE CLOSER YOU PENETRATED TO THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS MIND THE SOUNDER IT APPEARED
WHEN SUCH PERSONAGES COULD CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE SPECTACLE WITHOUT RISKING THE MAJESTY OR REVERENCE OF RANK AND OFFICE IT WAS SAFELY TO BE INFERRED THAT THE INFLICTION OF A LEGAL SENTENCE WOULD HAVE AN EARNEST AND EFFECTUAL MEANING
THE SERF WORE THE CUSTOMARY GARB OF SERVING-MEN AT THAT PERIOD AND LONG BEFORE IN THE OLD HEREDITARY HALLS OF ENGLAND
IF THOU FEELEST IT TO BE FOR THY SOUL'S PEACE AND THAT THY EARTHLY PUNISHMENT WILL THEREBY BE MADE MORE EFFECTUAL TO SALVATION I CHARGE THEE TO SPEAK OUT THE NAME OF THY FELLOW-SINNER AND FELLOW-SUFFERER
THE SCARLET LETTER I
THE ONLY TRUTH THAT CONTINUED TO GIVE MR DIMMESDALE A REAL EXISTENCE ON THIS EARTH WAS THE ANGUISH IN HIS INMOST SOUL AND THE UNDISSEMBLED EXPRESSION OF IT IN HIS ASPECT
THE VERY LAW THAT CONDEMNED HER--A GIANT OF STERN FEATURES BUT WITH VIGOUR TO SUPPORT AS WELL AS TO ANNIHILATE IN HIS IRON ARM--HAD HELD HER UP THROUGH THE TERRIBLE ORDEAL OF HER IGNOMINY
THE PHYSICIAN AS HE HAD A FAIR RIGHT TO BE TERMED NEXT BESTOWED HIS ATTENTION ON THE MOTHER
HERETOFORE THE MOTHER WHILE LOVING HER CHILD WITH THE INTENSITY OF A SOLE AFFECTION HAD SCHOOLED HERSELF TO HOPE FOR LITTLE OTHER RETURN THAN THE WAYWARDNESS OF AN APRIL BREEZE WHICH SPENDS ITS TIME IN AIRY SPORT AND HAS ITS GUSTS OF INEXPLICABLE PASSION AND IS PETULANT IN ITS BEST OF MOODS AND CHILLS OFTENER THAN CARESSES YOU WHEN YOU TAKE IT TO YOUR BOSOM
WHAT SENT YOU HITHER I HAVE BEEN WATCHING AT A DEATH-BED ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE AT GOVERNOR WINTHROP'S DEATH-BED AND HAVE TAKEN HIS MEASURE FOR A ROBE AND AM NOW GOING HOMEWARD TO MY DWELLING COME UP HITHER HESTER THOU AND LITTLE PEARL SAID THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE
ADMINISTER THIS DRAUGHT THEREFORE WITH THINE OWN HAND HESTER REPELLED THE OFFERED MEDICINE AT THE SAME TIME GAZING WITH STRONGLY MARKED APPREHENSION INTO HIS FACE
MY HEART WAS A HABITATION LARGE ENOUGH FOR MANY GUESTS BUT LONELY AND CHILL AND WITHOUT A HOUSEHOLD FIRE
OR BECAUSE HESTER REALLY FILLED A GAP WHICH MUST OTHERWISE HAVE REMAINED VACANT
BUT THE OBJECT THAT MOST DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE MYSTERIOUS PACKAGE WAS A CERTAIN AFFAIR OF FINE RED CLOTH MUCH WORN AND FADED THERE WERE TRACES ABOUT IT OF GOLD EMBROIDERY WHICH HOWEVER WAS GREATLY FRAYED AND DEFACED SO THAT NONE OR VERY LITTLE OF THE GLITTER WAS LEFT
SO HAS IT BEEN IN MY CASE
AND HERE SINCE HE HAD SO VALIANTLY FORBORNE ALL OTHER WICKEDNESS POOR MR DIMMESDALE LONGED AT LEAST TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE TARRY BLACK-GUARD AND RECREATE HIMSELF WITH A FEW IMPROPER JESTS SUCH AS DISSOLUTE SAILORS SO ABOUND WITH AND A VOLLEY OF GOOD ROUND SOLID SATISFACTORY AND HEAVEN-DEFYING OATHS
BIOGRAPHICAL STORIES FOR CHILDREN 1842
IT SEEMED TO BE HIS WISH AND PURPOSE TO MASK THIS EXPRESSION WITH A SMILE BUT THE LATTER PLAYED HIM FALSE AND FLICKERED OVER HIS VISAGE SO DERISIVELY THAT THE SPECTATOR COULD SEE HIS BLACKNESS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT
BUT LET IT PASS
PEARL LOOKED AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE DAY BUT WAS IN ONE OF THOSE MOODS OF PERVERSE MERRIMENT WHICH WHENEVER THEY OCCURRED SEEMED TO REMOVE HER ENTIRELY OUT OF THE SPHERE OF SYMPATHY OR HUMAN CONTACT
WITH ALL MY HEART
THE SCARLET LETTER WAS HER PASSPORT INTO REGIONS WHERE OTHER WOMEN DARED NOT TREAD
SOME OF THEM INDEED BY THEIR SERVICES IN THE LOW COUNTRIES AND ON OTHER FIELDS OF EUROPEAN WARFARE HAD FAIRLY WON THEIR TITLE TO ASSUME THE NAME AND POMP OF SOLDIERSHIP
BUT IN THE LAPSE OF THE TOILSOME THOUGHTFUL AND SELF-DEVOTED YEARS THAT MADE UP HESTER'S LIFE THE SCARLET LETTER CEASED TO BE A STIGMA WHICH ATTRACTED THE WORLD'S SCORN AND BITTERNESS AND BECAME A TYPE OF SOMETHING TO BE SORROWED OVER AND LOOKED UPON WITH AWE YET WITH REVERENCE TOO
I HAVE THOUGHT OF DEATH SAID SHE--"HAVE WISHED FOR IT--WOULD EVEN HAVE PRAYED FOR IT WERE IT FIT THAT SUCH AS I SHOULD PRAY FOR ANYTHING
SO BRIEF A JOURNEY WOULD BRING THEE FROM A WORLD WHERE THOU HAST BEEN MOST WRETCHED TO ONE WHERE THOU MAYEST STILL BE HAPPY
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE ESSENTIAL TO HIS PEACE TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF A FAITH ABOUT HIM SUPPORTING WHILE IT CONFINED HIM WITHIN ITS IRON FRAMEWORK
I THANK YOU AND CAN BUT REQUITE YOUR GOOD DEEDS WITH MY PRAYERS A GOOD MAN'S PRAYERS ARE GOLDEN RECOMPENSE REJOINED OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
SHE BORE ON HER BREAST IN THE CURIOUSLY EMBROIDERED LETTER A SPECIMEN OF HER DELICATE AND IMAGINATIVE SKILL OF WHICH THE DAMES OF A COURT MIGHT GLADLY HAVE AVAILED THEMSELVES TO ADD THE RICHER AND MORE SPIRITUAL ADORNMENT OF HUMAN INGENUITY TO THEIR FABRICS OF SILK AND GOLD
AT LAST--AT LAST!--I STAND UPON THE SPOT WHERE SEVEN YEARS SINCE I SHOULD HAVE STOOD HERE WITH THIS WOMAN WHOSE ARM MORE THAN THE LITTLE STRENGTH WHEREWITH I HAVE CREPT HITHERWARD SUSTAINS ME AT THIS DREADFUL MOMENT FROM GROVELLING DOWN UPON MY FACE
AND AT LAST AFTER SUBSISTING FOR FOUR YEARS ON THE MERCY OF A HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION TO BE COMPELLED THEN TO DEFINE HIS POSITION ANEW AND CLAIM THE YET MORE HUMILIATING MERCY OF A FRIENDLY ONE
SO PERFECT IN ONE POINT OF VIEW
HERE TO WITNESS THE SCENE WHICH WE ARE DESCRIBING SAT GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HIMSELF WITH FOUR SERGEANTS ABOUT HIS CHAIR BEARING HALBERDS AS A GUARD OF HONOUR
THE VICTIM WAS FOR EVER ON THE RACK
AND WHEN THEY STRIKE THE AXE MAY BE SHARP INDEED BUT ITS EDGE IS SELDOM POISONED WITH ILL-WILL
NOR HAD INSPIRATION EVER BREATHED THROUGH MORTAL LIPS MORE EVIDENTLY THAN IT DID THROUGH HIS
ITS FLOOR IS STREWN WITH GREY SAND IN A FASHION THAT HAS ELSEWHERE FALLEN INTO LONG DISUSE
THIS PERSONAGE PREFIGURED AND REPRESENTED IN HIS ASPECT THE WHOLE DISMAL SEVERITY OF THE PURITANIC CODE OF LAW WHICH IT WAS HIS BUSINESS TO ADMINISTER IN ITS FINAL AND CLOSEST APPLICATION TO THE OFFENDER
AND THE DANIEL WHO SHALL EXPOUND IT IS YET A-WANTING ANSWERED THE TOWNSMAN
HER FACE SO LONG FAMILIAR TO THE TOWNSPEOPLE SHOWED THE MARBLE QUIETUDE WHICH THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD THERE
FINALLY LITTLE HEROIC AS HE WAS IT SEEMED MORE DECOROUS TO BE OVERTHROWN IN THE DOWNFALL OF THE PARTY WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONTENT TO STAND THAN TO REMAIN A FORLORN SURVIVOR WHEN SO MANY WORTHIER MEN WERE FALLING
ACCORDINGLY THE CROWD WAS SOMBRE AND GRAVE
IT WAS AS IF SHE WERE HOVERING IN THE AIR AND MIGHT VANISH LIKE A GLIMMERING LIGHT THAT COMES WE KNOW NOT WHENCE AND GOES WE KNOW NOT WHITHER
WOULD YOU THEREFORE THAT YOUR PHYSICIAN HEAL THE BODILY EVIL
PEARL WAS DECKED OUT WITH AIRY GAIETY
THE PUBLIC IS DESPOTIC IN ITS TEMPER
AT THE OTHER END THOUGH PARTLY MUFFLED BY A CURTAIN IT WAS MORE POWERFULLY ILLUMINATED BY ONE OF THOSE EMBOWED HALL WINDOWS WHICH WE READ OF IN OLD BOOKS AND WHICH WAS PROVIDED WITH A DEEP AND CUSHIONED SEAT
THEY HAVE KEPT THY BETTER PART IN BONDAGE TOO LONG ALREADY IT CANNOT BE ANSWERED THE MINISTER LISTENING AS IF HE WERE CALLED UPON TO REALISE A DREAM
THE SPORTIVE SUNLIGHT--FEEBLY SPORTIVE AT BEST IN THE PREDOMINANT PENSIVENESS OF THE DAY AND SCENE--WITHDREW ITSELF AS THEY CAME NIGH AND LEFT THE SPOTS WHERE IT HAD DANCED THE DREARIER BECAUSE THEY HAD HOPED TO FIND THEM BRIGHT
AND THE STITCH AS I AM ASSURED BY LADIES CONVERSANT WITH SUCH MYSTERIES GIVES EVIDENCE OF A NOW FORGOTTEN ART NOT TO BE DISCOVERED EVEN BY THE PROCESS OF PICKING OUT THE THREADS
UNTIL--PERHAPS WITH THAT PERVERSE EXPRESSION GLIMMERING FROM BENEATH HER OPENING LIDS--LITTLE PEARL AWOKE
AND NOW MISTRESS PRYNNE SAID OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AS HE WAS HEREAFTER TO BE NAMED I LEAVE THEE ALONE
AND WITH WHAT SECURITY TWO PERSONS WHO CHOOSE TO AVOID A CERTAIN SUBJECT MAY APPROACH ITS VERY VERGE AND RETIRE WITHOUT DISTURBING IT
MORE THAN ONCE HE HAD CLEARED HIS THROAT AND DRAWN IN THE LONG DEEP AND TREMULOUS BREATH WHICH WHEN SENT FORTH AGAIN WOULD COME BURDENED WITH THE BLACK SECRET OF HIS SOUL
HE WAS LODGED IN THE PRISON NOT AS SUSPECTED OF ANY OFFENCE BUT AS THE MOST CONVENIENT AND SUITABLE MODE OF DISPOSING OF HIM UNTIL THE MAGISTRATES SHOULD HAVE CONFERRED WITH THE INDIAN SAGAMORES RESPECTING HIS RANSOM
FROM FATHER TO SON FOR ABOVE A HUNDRED YEARS THEY FOLLOWED THE SEA
FEAR NOTHING
A TORTURE TO BE FELT AT MANY AN UNTHOUGHT-OF MOMENT
THAT WAS NOT KIND SAID HESTER
MIGHTY WAS THEIR FUSS ABOUT LITTLE MATTERS AND MARVELLOUS SOMETIMES THE OBTUSENESS THAT ALLOWED GREATER ONES TO SLIP BETWEEN THEIR FINGERS WHENEVER SUCH A MISCHANCE OCCURRED--WHEN A WAGGON-LOAD OF VALUABLE MERCHANDISE HAD BEEN SMUGGLED ASHORE AT NOONDAY PERHAPS AND DIRECTLY BENEATH THEIR UNSUSPICIOUS NOSES--NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE VIGILANCE AND ALACRITY WITH WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO LOCK AND DOUBLE-LOCK AND SECURE WITH TAPE AND SEALING-WAX ALL THE AVENUES OF THE DELINQUENT VESSEL
AN ENTIRE CLASS OF SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND A GIFT CONNECTED WITH THEM--OF NO GREAT RICHNESS OR VALUE BUT THE BEST I HAD--WAS GONE FROM ME
WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HESTER PRYNNE WERE EVER AFTERWARDS SO TOUCHED AND SO TRANSFIGURED
WHILE THE FROZEN WITTICISMS OF PAST GENERATIONS WERE THAWED OUT AND CAME BUBBLING WITH LAUGHTER FROM THEIR LIPS
THE INTERVIEW AFTER HER RETURN TO THE PRISON HESTER PRYNNE WAS FOUND TO BE IN A STATE OF NERVOUS EXCITEMENT THAT DEMANDED CONSTANT WATCHFULNESS LEST SHE SHOULD PERPETRATE VIOLENCE ON HERSELF OR DO SOME HALF-FRENZIED MISCHIEF TO THE POOR BABE
AND THE RESULT WAS A BEING WHOSE ELEMENTS WERE PERHAPS BEAUTIFUL AND BRILLIANT BUT ALL IN DISORDER OR WITH AN ORDER PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES AMIDST WHICH THE POINT OF VARIETY AND ARRANGEMENT WAS DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DISCOVERED
PEARL PUNISHES ME TOO
FOR AS OUR GOOD GOVERNOR WINTHROP WAS MADE AN ANGEL THIS PAST NIGHT IT WAS DOUBTLESS HELD FIT THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME NOTICE THEREOF NO ANSWERED THE MINISTER
A REMARKABLE EVENT OF THE THIRD YEAR OF MY SURVEYORSHIP--TO ADOPT THE TONE OF P
NOW GO THY WAYS AND DEAL AS THOU WILT WITH YONDER MAN HE WAVED HIS HAND AND BETOOK HIMSELF AGAIN TO HIS EMPLOYMENT OF GATHERING HERBS
THE ONLY SURGEON WAS ONE WHO COMBINED THE OCCASIONAL EXERCISE OF THAT NOBLE ART WITH THE DAILY AND HABITUAL FLOURISH OF A RAZOR
THEREBY EVERY GOOD CHRISTIAN MAN HATH A TITLE TO SHOW A FATHER'S KINDNESS TOWARDS THE POOR DESERTED BABE THE AFFAIR BEING SO SATISFACTORILY CONCLUDED HESTER PRYNNE WITH PEARL DEPARTED FROM THE HOUSE
IT STOOD ON THE SHORE LOOKING ACROSS A BASIN OF THE SEA AT THE FOREST-COVERED HILLS TOWARDS THE WEST
IF IN OUR COUNTRY VALOUR WERE REWARDED BY HERALDIC HONOUR THIS PHRASE--WHICH IT SEEMS SO EASY TO SPEAK BUT WHICH ONLY HE WITH SUCH A TASK OF DANGER AND GLORY BEFORE HIM HAS EVER SPOKEN--WOULD BE THE BEST AND FITTEST OF ALL MOTTOES FOR THE GENERAL'S SHIELD OF ARMS
FOR AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSIGN A REASON FOR SUCH DISTRUST AND ABHORRENCE SO MR DIMMESDALE CONSCIOUS THAT THE POISON OF ONE MORBID SPOT WAS INFECTING HIS HEART'S ENTIRE SUBSTANCE ATTRIBUTED ALL HIS PRESENTIMENTS TO NO OTHER CAUSE
A MAN OVER WHOSE KINDLY NATURE HABIT HAD NO SLIGHT INFLUENCE
HAS HE NOT PAID THEE ALL NO NO
OR IS SHE AN ELFISH SPIRIT WHO AS THE LEGENDS OF OUR CHILDHOOD TAUGHT US IS FORBIDDEN TO CROSS A RUNNING STREAM
THEREFORE TO EXHORT HER TO REPENTANCE AND TO CONFESSION AS A PROOF AND CONSEQUENCE THEREOF THE DIRECTNESS OF THIS APPEAL DREW THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CROWD UPON THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE--YOUNG CLERGYMAN WHO HAD COME FROM ONE OF THE GREAT ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES BRINGING ALL THE LEARNING OF THE AGE INTO OUR WILD FOREST LAND
BENEATH THE SKY IT PEALED UPWARD TO THE ZENITH
FEW SECRETS CAN ESCAPE AN INVESTIGATOR WHO HAS OPPORTUNITY AND LICENCE TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A QUEST AND SKILL TO FOLLOW IT UP
BUT WHERE WAS HIS MIND
IN EITHER CASE THERE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR ON THE PART OF THE SPECTATORS AS BEFITTED A PEOPLE AMONG WHOM RELIGION AND LAW WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL AND IN WHOSE CHARACTER BOTH WERE SO THOROUGHLY INTERFUSED THAT THE MILDEST AND SEVEREST ACTS OF PUBLIC DISCIPLINE WERE ALIKE MADE VENERABLE AND AWFUL
IT IS HESTER PRYNNE SHE REPLIED IN A TONE OF SURPRISE
DANCING UP AND DOWN LIKE A LITTLE ELF WHENEVER SHE HIT THE SCARLET LETTER
THEN I CONSENTED TO A DECEPTION
AS THE LIFE AND GOOD FAME OF YONDER MAN WERE IN YOUR HANDS THERE SEEMED NO CHOICE TO ME SAVE TO BE SILENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR BEHEST
DOST THOU NOT THINK HER BEAUTIFUL
PEARL SAID HE WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY THOU MUST TAKE HEED TO INSTRUCTION THAT SO IN DUE SEASON THOU MAYEST WEAR IN THY BOSOM THE PEARL OF GREAT PRICE
THE LATTER WAS BY FAR THE MOST SHOWY AND GALLANT FIGURE SO FAR AS APPAREL WENT ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN AMONG THE MULTITUDE
PEARL KEEPS ME HERE IN LIFE
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SCANDAL INDEED NOR PERIL TO THE HOLY WHITENESS OF THE CLERGYMAN'S GOOD FAME HAD SHE VISITED HIM IN HIS OWN STUDY WHERE MANY A PENITENT ERE NOW HAD CONFESSED SINS OF PERHAPS AS DEEP A DYE AS THE ONE BETOKENED BY THE SCARLET LETTER
THE EXAMPLE OF THE FAMOUS P
LET HER SEE NOTHING STRANGE--NO PASSION OR EAGERNESS--IN THY WAY OF ACCOSTING HER WHISPERED HESTER
WHEREVER THERE IS A HEART AND AN INTELLECT THE DISEASES OF THE PHYSICAL FRAME ARE TINGED WITH THE PECULIARITIES OF THESE
FEW LIVES SO RICH WITH BENEFITS CONFERRED
I KNOW NOT THAT I ESPECIALLY NEEDED THE LESSON EITHER IN THE WAY OF WARNING OR REBUKE
AND ALL THIS TIME PERCHANCE WHEN POOR MR DIMMESDALE WAS THINKING OF HIS GRAVE HE QUESTIONED WITH HIMSELF WHETHER THE GRASS WOULD EVER GROW ON IT BECAUSE AN ACCURSED THING MUST THERE BE BURIED
HIS POSITION IS THEN ONE OF THE MOST SINGULARLY IRKSOME AND IN EVERY CONTINGENCY DISAGREEABLE THAT A WRETCHED MORTAL CAN POSSIBLY OCCUPY
OTHERS CONTENDED THAT THE STIGMA HAD NOT BEEN PRODUCED UNTIL A LONG TIME SUBSEQUENT WHEN OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH BEING A POTENT NECROMANCER HAD CAUSED IT TO APPEAR THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MAGIC AND POISONOUS DRUGS
BUT THERE LAY THE EMBROIDERED LETTER GLITTERING LIKE A LOST JEWEL WHICH SOME ILL-FATED WANDERER MIGHT PICK UP AND THENCEFORTH BE HAUNTED BY STRANGE PHANTOMS OF GUILT SINKINGS OF THE HEART AND UNACCOUNTABLE MISFORTUNE
I SHALL FEEL MYSELF SHUDDER SUDDENLY AND UNAWARES
IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD THE OLD PHYSICIAN AND THE MINISTER--MUTUAL VICTIMS AS THEY HAVE BEEN--MAY UNAWARES HAVE FOUND THEIR EARTHLY STOCK OF HATRED AND ANTIPATHY TRANSMUTED INTO GOLDEN LOVE
NOT SO MUCH BY AN IMPULSE OF MOTHERLY AFFECTION AS THAT SHE MIGHT THEREBY CONCEAL A CERTAIN TOKEN WHICH WAS WROUGHT OR FASTENED INTO HER DRESS
THE DAYS OF THE FAR-OFF FUTURE WOULD TOIL ONWARD STILL WITH THE SAME BURDEN FOR HER TO TAKE UP AND BEAR ALONG WITH HER BUT NEVER TO FLING DOWN
THE GOOD OLD MAN ADDRESSED HIM WITH THE PATERNAL AFFECTION AND PATRIARCHAL PRIVILEGE WHICH HIS VENERABLE AGE HIS UPRIGHT AND HOLY CHARACTER AND HIS STATION IN THE CHURCH ENTITLED HIM TO USE AND CONJOINED WITH THIS THE DEEP ALMOST WORSHIPPING RESPECT WHICH THE MINISTER'S PROFESSIONAL AND PRIVATE CLAIMS ALIKE DEMANDED
SO THAT EVERY EBB AND FLOW OF THE MINISTER'S LIFE-TIDE MIGHT PASS UNDER THE EYE OF HIS ANXIOUS AND ATTACHED PHYSICIAN
HE SENT EVEN ME THY MOTHER
AND HERE SOME SIX MONTHS AGO--PACING FROM CORNER TO CORNER OR LOUNGING ON THE LONG-LEGGED STOOL WITH HIS ELBOW ON THE DESK AND HIS EYES WANDERING UP AND DOWN THE COLUMNS OF THE MORNING NEWSPAPER--YOU MIGHT HAVE RECOGNISED HONOURED READER THE SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO WELCOMED YOU INTO HIS CHEERY LITTLE STUDY WHERE THE SUNSHINE GLIMMERED SO PLEASANTLY THROUGH THE WILLOW BRANCHES ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE OLD MANSE
WHAT ELSE COULD I LOOK FOR BEING WHAT I AM AND LEADING SUCH A LIFE AS MINE
IV
A GIFT A FACULTY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN DEPARTED WAS SUSPENDED AND INANIMATE WITHIN ME
STILL EVEN IN RESPECT OF GRACE AND BEAUTY THERE WERE POINTS WELL WORTH NOTING
WE MEN OF STUDY WHOSE HEADS ARE IN OUR BOOKS HAVE NEED TO BE STRAITLY LOOKED AFTER
AND AS IF THE GLOOM OF THE EARTH AND SKY HAD BEEN BUT THE EFFLUENCE OF THESE TWO MORTAL HEARTS IT VANISHED WITH THEIR SORROW
YONDER DIVINE MAN
GOD GAVE HER THE CHILD AND GAVE HER TOO AN INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS NATURE AND REQUIREMENTS--BOTH SEEMINGLY SO PECULIAR--WHICH NO OTHER MORTAL BEING CAN POSSESS
WOULD YOU BRING INFAMY ON YOUR SACRED PROFESSION HA TEMPTER
INDIVIDUALS OF WISER FAITH INDEED WHO KNEW THAT HEAVEN PROMOTES ITS PURPOSES WITHOUT AIMING AT THE STAGE-EFFECT OF WHAT IS CALLED MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITION WERE INCLINED TO SEE A PROVIDENTIAL HAND IN ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S SO OPPORTUNE ARRIVAL
XX
TO THIS PURPOSE HE SENT HIS WIFE BEFORE HIM REMAINING HIMSELF TO LOOK AFTER SOME NECESSARY AFFAIRS
A ROUGH-LOOKING SET OF TARPAULINS WITHOUT THE ALERTNESS OF THE YANKEE ASPECT BUT CONTRIBUTING AN ITEM OF NO SLIGHT IMPORTANCE TO OUR DECAYING TRADE
THOU LITTLE KNOWEST WHAT A RELIEF IT IS AFTER THE TORMENT OF A SEVEN YEARS CHEAT TO LOOK INTO AN EYE THAT RECOGNISES ME FOR WHAT I AM
WHERE NEW LIFE HAD AWAITED HER STILL IN CONNEXION WITH THE MISSHAPEN SCHOLAR
THE FATHERS AND FOUNDERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH--THE STATESMAN THE PRIEST AND THE SOLDIER--SEEMED IT A DUTY THEN TO ASSUME THE OUTWARD STATE AND MAJESTY WHICH IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANTIQUE STYLE WAS LOOKED UPON AS THE PROPER GARB OF PUBLIC AND SOCIAL EMINENCE
AND TO HEAR HIM TALK OF ROAST MEAT WAS AS APPETIZING AS A PICKLE OR AN OYSTER
THEY SELDOM IT WOULD APPEAR PARTOOK OF THE RELIGIOUS ZEAL THAT BROUGHT OTHER EMIGRANTS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC
BUT AT MIDNIGHT AND IN THE FOREST WE SHALL HAVE OTHER TALK TOGETHER SHE PASSED ON WITH HER AGED STATELINESS BUT OFTEN TURNING BACK HER HEAD AND SMILING AT HIM LIKE ONE WILLING TO RECOGNISE A SECRET INTIMACY OF CONNEXION
I TELL THEE MY SOUL SHIVERS AT HIM MUTTERED THE MINISTER AGAIN
NEITHER CAN I ANY LONGER LIVE WITHOUT HER COMPANIONSHIP
SPEAK FRANKLY I PRAY YOU BE IT FOR LIFE OR DEATH FREELY THEN AND PLAINLY SAID THE PHYSICIAN STILL BUSY WITH HIS PLANTS BUT KEEPING A WARY EYE ON MR DIMMESDALE THE DISORDER IS A STRANGE ONE
UNCLE SAM'S GOLD--MEANING NO DISRESPECT TO THE WORTHY OLD GENTLEMAN--HAS IN THIS RESPECT A QUALITY OF ENCHANTMENT LIKE THAT OF THE DEVIL'S WAGES
YEARS HAD COME AND GONE
HER NATURE APPEARED TO POSSESS DEPTH TOO AS WELL AS VARIETY
SHE SHUDDERED TO BELIEVE YET COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT IT GAVE HER A SYMPATHETIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE HIDDEN SIN IN OTHER HEARTS
SHE POSSESSED AFFECTIONS TOO THOUGH HITHERTO ACRID AND DISAGREEABLE AS ARE THE RICHEST FLAVOURS OF UNRIPE FRUIT
OR AT ALL EVENTS THE MAINSPRING THAT KEPT ITS VARIOUSLY REVOLVING WHEELS IN MOTION
CAN THIS BE YOU
THERE ARE NONE IN THIS LAND THAT KNOW ME
WHAT WERE THEY
HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE
THEREFORE FIRST ALLOWING HER TO PASS THEY PURSUED HER AT A DISTANCE WITH SHRILL CRIES AND THE UTTERANCES OF A WORD THAT HAD NO DISTINCT PURPORT TO THEIR OWN MINDS BUT WAS NONE THE LESS TERRIBLE TO HER AS PROCEEDING FROM LIPS THAT BABBLED IT UNCONSCIOUSLY
BUT WHILE SHE SAID IT PEARL LAUGHED AND BEGAN TO DANCE UP AND DOWN WITH THE HUMOURSOME GESTICULATION OF A LITTLE IMP WHOSE NEXT FREAK MIGHT BE TO FLY UP THE CHIMNEY
THAT WILL LEAVE THEE POWERLESS EVEN TO REPENT
IT SHOWED PEARL IN AN UNWONTED ASPECT
WHEN HAST THOU BEEN SO SLUGGISH BEFORE NOW
I WILL NOT LOSE THE CHILD
I WILL NOT LOSE THE CHILD
HIS SPIRIT ROSE AS IT WERE WITH A BOUND AND ATTAINED A NEARER PROSPECT OF THE SKY THAN THROUGHOUT ALL THE MISERY WHICH HAD KEPT HIM GROVELLING ON THE EARTH
AT THE HEAD OF THE SOCIAL SYSTEM AS THE CLERGYMEN OF THAT DAY STOOD HE WAS ONLY THE MORE TRAMMELLED BY ITS REGULATIONS ITS PRINCIPLES AND EVEN ITS PREJUDICES
WILT THOU REJECT THAT PRICELESS BENEFIT PEACE HESTER--PEACE REPLIED THE OLD MAN WITH GLOOMY STERNNESS--"IT IS NOT GRANTED ME TO PARDON
AND ABOUT WHAT OH A STORY ABOUT THE BLACK MAN ANSWERED PEARL TAKING HOLD OF HER MOTHER'S GOWN AND LOOKING UP HALF EARNESTLY HALF MISCHIEVOUSLY INTO HER FACE
AFTER A TIME AT A HINT FROM ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THE FRIENDS OF MR DIMMESDALE EFFECTED AN ARRANGEMENT BY WHICH THE TWO WERE LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
IT IS NO MATTER THAT THE PLACE IS JOYLESS FOR HIM
MR WILSON NOT A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT THIS OUTBREAK--FOR HE WAS A GRANDFATHERLY SORT OF PERSONAGE AND USUALLY A VAST FAVOURITE WITH CHILDREN--ESSAYED HOWEVER TO PROCEED WITH THE EXAMINATION
HE SHOULD NOT NOD AND SMILE AT ME FOR ALL THAT--THE BLACK GRIM UGLY-EYED OLD MAN SAID PEARL
PANSIE A FRAGMENT HAWTHORNE LAST LITERARY EFFORT 1864
IT IS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD READY AND FAIRLY REQUITED EMPLOYMENT FOR AS MANY HOURS AS SHE SAW FIT TO OCCUPY WITH HER NEEDLE
THEN DOWN HE SANK UPON THE SCAFFOLD
HAD THERE BEEN A PAPIST AMONG THE CROWD OF PURITANS HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IN THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SO PICTURESQUE IN HER ATTIRE AND MIEN AND WITH THE INFANT AT HER BOSOM AN OBJECT TO REMIND HIM OF THE IMAGE OF DIVINE MATERNITY WHICH SO MANY ILLUSTRIOUS PAINTERS HAVE VIED WITH ONE ANOTHER TO REPRESENT
BUT MOTHER TELL ME NOW
BUT NOW THE IDEA CAME STRONGLY INTO HESTER'S MIND THAT PEARL WITH HER REMARKABLE PRECOCITY AND ACUTENESS MIGHT ALREADY HAVE APPROACHED THE AGE WHEN SHE COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A FRIEND AND INTRUSTED WITH AS MUCH OF HER MOTHER'S SORROWS AS COULD BE IMPARTED WITHOUT IRREVERENCE EITHER TO THE PARENT OR THE CHILD
HIS INTEGRITY WAS PERFECT
THE DRESS SO PROPER WAS IT TO LITTLE PEARL SEEMED AN EFFLUENCE OR INEVITABLE DEVELOPMENT AND OUTWARD MANIFESTATION OF HER CHARACTER NO MORE TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER THAN THE MANY-HUED BRILLIANCY FROM A BUTTERFLY'S WING OR THE PAINTED GLORY FROM THE LEAF OF A BRIGHT FLOWER
FOR THROUGHOUT THAT CHAIN OF ANCESTRY EVERY SUCCESSIVE MOTHER HAD TRANSMITTED TO HER CHILD A FAINTER BLOOM A MORE DELICATE AND BRIEFER BEAUTY AND A SLIGHTER PHYSICAL FRAME IF NOT CHARACTER OF LESS FORCE AND SOLIDITY THAN HER OWN
WHITE-HEADED AND WRINKLED IMAGES WHICH MY FANCY USED TO SPORT WITH AND HAS NOW FLUNG ASIDE FOR EVER
SHE MARVELLED HOW SUCH SCENES COULD HAVE BEEN
SO LITTLE ADAPTED IS THE ATMOSPHERE OF A CUSTOM-HOUSE TO THE DELICATE HARVEST OF FANCY AND SENSIBILITY THAT HAD I REMAINED THERE THROUGH TEN PRESIDENCIES YET TO COME I DOUBT WHETHER THE TALE OF THE SCARLET LETTER WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC EYE
AND THEY ARE TO WRITE THEIR NAMES WITH THEIR OWN BLOOD
IT CONVERTS THEM FROM SNOW-IMAGES INTO MEN AND WOMEN
THEN--THE MORNING LIGHT STILL WAXING STRONGER--OLD PATRIARCHS WOULD RISE UP IN GREAT HASTE EACH IN HIS FLANNEL GOWN AND MATRONLY DAMES WITHOUT PAUSING TO PUT OFF THEIR NIGHT-GEAR
WITH HER KNOWLEDGE OF A TRAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES HIDDEN FROM ALL OTHERS SHE COULD READILY INFER THAT BESIDES THE LEGITIMATE ACTION OF HIS OWN CONSCIENCE A TERRIBLE MACHINERY HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR AND WAS STILL OPERATING ON MR DIMMESDALE'S WELL-BEING AND REPOSE
A PORTION OF HIS FACTS BY-THE-BY DID ME GOOD SERVICE IN THE PREPARATION OF THE ARTICLE ENTITLED MAIN STREET INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME
BUT HERE IN THE SUNNY DAY AND AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE HE KNOWS US NOT
IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS LEARNED MAN WAS THE PHYSICIAN AS WELL AS FRIEND OF THE YOUNG MINISTER WHOSE HEALTH HAD SEVERELY SUFFERED OF LATE BY HIS TOO UNRESERVED SELF-SACRIFICE TO THE LABOURS AND DUTIES OF THE PASTORAL RELATION
BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT THOU SAYEST
SHE BROKE CONTINUALLY INTO SHOUTS OF A WILD INARTICULATE AND SOMETIMES PIERCING MUSIC
ENGLISH NOTE BOOKS EDITED BY SOPHIA HAWTHORNE 1870
THIS DIABOLICAL AGENT HAD THE DIVINE PERMISSION FOR A SEASON TO BURROW INTO THE CLERGYMAN'S INTIMACY AND PLOT AGAINST HIS SOUL
NOR WOULD IT HAVE MENDED THE MATTER IN THE LEAST HAD THOSE SAME UNPROFITABLE PAGES BEEN WRITTEN WITH A PEN LIKE THAT OF BURNS OR OF CHAUCER EACH OF WHOM WAS A CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER IN HIS DAY AS WELL AS I
I PROFESS I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIKE SINCE MY DAYS OF VANITY IN OLD KING JAMES'S TIME WHEN I WAS WONT TO ESTEEM IT A HIGH FAVOUR TO BE ADMITTED TO A COURT MASK
HERE AND THERE PERCHANCE THE WALLS MAY REMAIN ALMOST COMPLETE
LOVE WHETHER NEWLY-BORN OR AROUSED FROM A DEATH-LIKE SLUMBER MUST ALWAYS CREATE A SUNSHINE FILLING THE HEART SO FULL OF RADIANCE THAT IT OVERFLOWS UPON THE OUTWARD WORLD
LITTLE PEARL OF COURSE WAS HER COMPANION
IN REQUITAL OF WHICH MISDEMEANOURS IT WILL SOMETIMES OF ITS OWN VAGUE PURPOSE KISS YOUR CHEEK WITH A KIND OF DOUBTFUL TENDERNESS AND PLAY GENTLY WITH YOUR HAIR AND THEN BE GONE ABOUT ITS OTHER IDLE BUSINESS LEAVING A DREAMY PLEASURE AT YOUR HEART
AND AS FOR THE SCARLET LETTER I WEAR IT FOR THE SAKE OF ITS GOLD THREAD IN ALL THE SEVEN BYGONE YEARS HESTER PRYNNE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN FALSE TO THE SYMBOL ON HER BOSOM
NO MERRY ANDREW TO STIR UP THE MULTITUDE WITH JESTS PERHAPS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD BUT STILL EFFECTIVE BY THEIR APPEALS TO THE VERY BROADEST SOURCES OF MIRTHFUL SYMPATHY
OR IF IT DID THE DROWSY SLUMBERERS MISTOOK THE CRY EITHER FOR SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL IN A DREAM OR FOR THE NOISE OF WITCHES WHOSE VOICES AT THAT PERIOD WERE OFTEN HEARD TO PASS OVER THE SETTLEMENTS OR LONELY COTTAGES AS THEY RODE WITH SATAN THROUGH THE AIR
HER MOTHER WHILE PEARL WAS YET AN INFANT GREW ACQUAINTED WITH A CERTAIN PECULIAR LOOK THAT WARNED HER WHEN IT WOULD BE LABOUR THROWN AWAY TO INSIST PERSUADE OR PLEAD
IT IS NO BLACK MAN
SO THAT A GLEAM OF FLICKERING SUNSHINE MIGHT NOW AND THEN BE SEEN AT ITS SOLITARY PLAY ALONG THE PATH
LONELY AS WAS HESTER'S SITUATION AND WITHOUT A FRIEND ON EARTH WHO DARED TO SHOW HIMSELF SHE HOWEVER INCURRED NO RISK OF WANT
AS MOST OF THESE OLD CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICERS HAD GOOD TRAITS AND AS MY POSITION IN REFERENCE TO THEM BEING PATERNAL AND PROTECTIVE WAS FAVOURABLE TO THE GROWTH OF FRIENDLY SENTIMENTS I SOON GREW TO LIKE THEM ALL
HE KNEW THAT IT WAS HIMSELF THE THIN AND WHITE-CHEEKED MINISTER WHO HAD DONE AND SUFFERED THESE THINGS AND WRITTEN THUS FAR INTO THE ELECTION SERMON
YOU CARRY IT OFF LIKE AN OLD HAND
WITH AN EASY CONDESCENSION AND KIND FORBEARANCE TOWARDS OUR STUPIDITY--WHICH TO HIS ORDER OF MIND MUST HAVE SEEMED LITTLE SHORT OF CRIME--WOULD HE FORTH-WITH BY THE MEREST TOUCH OF HIS FINGER MAKE THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS CLEAR AS DAYLIGHT
ANOTHER MAN HAD RETURNED OUT OF THE FOREST--A WISER ONE--WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HIDDEN MYSTERIES WHICH THE SIMPLICITY OF THE FORMER NEVER COULD HAVE REACHED
THE TUMULT OF THE BATTLE
NOW IT WAS THAT THE LUCUBRATIONS OF MY ANCIENT PREDECESSOR MR SURVEYOR PUE CAME INTO PLAY
THUS IT WAS WITH THE MEN OF RANK ON WHOM THEIR EMINENT POSITION IMPOSED THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE PUBLIC MORALS
THERE USED TO BE A SWARM OF THESE SMALL APPARITIONS IN HOLIDAY TIME AND WE CALLED THEM CHILDREN OF THE LORD OF MISRULE
WHILE ALL THE SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCE OF OUR RACE AND ALL THE EVENTS THAT BRIGHTENED OR DARKENED HIS INDIVIDUAL CAREER HAD GONE OVER HIM WITH AS LITTLE PERMANENT EFFECT AS THE PASSING BREEZE
THE BOOK-CASE
IT WAS A FACE FIEND-LIKE FULL OF SMILING MALICE YET BEARING THE SEMBLANCE OF FEATURES THAT SHE HAD KNOWN FULL WELL THOUGH SELDOM WITH A SMILE AND NEVER WITH MALICE IN THEM
ALL AROUND THERE WERE MONUMENTS CARVED WITH ARMORIAL BEARINGS
AS A FINAL DISPOSITION I CONTEMPLATE DEPOSITING THEM WITH THE ESSEX HISTORICAL SOCIETY
SO THE MINISTER AND THE PHYSICIAN WITH HIM WITHDREW AGAIN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHAT THEIR CHURCH DEFINED AS ORTHODOX
THE PREJUDICES WHICH THEY SHARED IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER WERE FORTIFIED IN THEMSELVES BY AN IRON FRAME-WORK OF REASONING THAT MADE IT A FAR TOUGHER LABOUR TO EXPEL THEM
DOST THOU KNOW THE MAN
THIS RAG OF SCARLET CLOTH--FOR TIME AND WEAR AND A SACRILEGIOUS MOTH HAD REDUCED IT TO LITTLE OTHER THAN A RAG--ON CAREFUL EXAMINATION ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF A LETTER
BUT THE SPIRITUAL ELEMENT TOOK UP THE FEEBLE FRAME AND CARRIED IT ALONG UNCONSCIOUS OF THE BURDEN AND CONVERTING IT TO SPIRIT LIKE ITSELF
HAWTHORNE 1872
IN THE OPEN AIR THEIR RAPTURE BROKE INTO SPEECH
IN SOME MONTHS OF THE YEAR HOWEVER THERE OFTEN CHANCES A FORENOON WHEN AFFAIRS MOVE ONWARD WITH A LIVELIER TREAD
OR IT MIGHT WELL BE THAT THE PHYSICIAN WAS NOT CAREFUL THEN AS AT ALL OTHER TIMES TO HIDE THE MALEVOLENCE WITH WHICH HE LOOKED UPON HIS VICTIM
ONE LITTLE GRAY BIRD WITH A WHITE BREAST PEARL WAS ALMOST SURE HAD BEEN HIT BY A PEBBLE AND FLUTTERED AWAY WITH A BROKEN WING
BUT ON SECOND THOUGHTS TURNING PALE
TAKE HEED HOW THOU DENIEST TO HIM--WHO PERCHANCE HATH NOT THE COURAGE TO GRASP IT FOR HIMSELF--THE BITTER BUT WHOLESOME CUP THAT IS NOW PRESENTED TO THY LIPS THE YOUNG PASTOR'S VOICE WAS TREMULOUSLY SWEET RICH DEEP AND BROKEN
A FOREST WALK CHAPTER XVII
IN MY PARTICULAR CASE THE CONSOLATORY TOPICS WERE CLOSE AT HAND AND INDEED HAD SUGGESTED THEMSELVES TO MY MEDITATIONS A CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE IT WAS REQUISITE TO USE THEM
THE MARKET-PLACE CHAPTER III
WHAT THINK YE GOSSIPS
THE WHOLE GANG OF SAILORS LIKEWISE OBSERVING THE PRESS OF SPECTATORS AND LEARNING THE PURPORT OF THE SCARLET LETTER CAME AND THRUST THEIR SUNBURNT AND DESPERADO-LOOKING FACES INTO THE RING
OFTENER HOWEVER ITS CREDIBILITY RESTED ON THE FAITH OF SOME LONELY EYE-WITNESS WHO BEHELD THE WONDER THROUGH THE COLOURED MAGNIFYING AND DISTORTED MEDIUM OF HIS IMAGINATION AND SHAPED IT MORE DISTINCTLY IN HIS AFTER-THOUGHT
FURTHERMORE ON THE LEFT HAND AS YOU ENTER THE FRONT DOOR IS A CERTAIN ROOM OR OFFICE ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE AND OF A LOFTY HEIGHT WITH TWO OF ITS ARCHED WINDOWS COMMANDING A VIEW OF THE AFORESAID DILAPIDATED WHARF AND THE THIRD LOOKING ACROSS A NARROW LANE AND ALONG A PORTION OF DERBY STREET
NEITHER BY THEIR REPORT HAD HIS DYING WORDS ACKNOWLEDGED NOR EVEN REMOTELY IMPLIED ANY--THE SLIGHTEST--CONNEXION ON HIS PART WITH THE GUILT FOR WHICH HESTER PRYNNE HAD SO LONG WORN THE SCARLET LETTER
THEN THOU SHALT KNOW WHEREFORE THE MINISTER KEEPS HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART LAUGHING SO SHRILLY THAT ALL THE MARKET-PLACE COULD HEAR HER THE WEIRD OLD GENTLEWOMAN TOOK HER DEPARTURE
FOR IT HAD BEEN MANUFACTURED BY A SKILFUL ARMOURER IN LONDON THE SAME YEAR IN WHICH GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM CAME OVER TO NEW ENGLAND
ART THOU IN LIFE EVEN SO SHE ANSWERED
NO LONGER SEEKING NOR CARING THAT MY NAME SHOULD BE BLASONED ABROAD ON TITLE-PAGES I SMILED TO THINK THAT IT HAD NOW ANOTHER KIND OF VOGUE
THERE WERE MEN TOO OF A STURDIER TEXTURE OF MIND THAN HIS AND ENDOWED WITH A FAR GREATER SHARE OF SHREWD HARD IRON OR GRANITE UNDERSTANDING
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO TALK LIGHTLY OF A LEARNED AND PIOUS MINISTER OF THE WORD LIKE THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE FIE WOMAN--FIE CRIED THE OLD LADY SHAKING HER FINGER AT HESTER
NAY MORE THEY HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON THE SCARLET LETTER AS THE TOKEN NOT OF THAT ONE SIN FOR WHICH SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG AND DREARY A PENANCE BUT OF HER MANY GOOD DEEDS SINCE
AS THE LIGHT DREW NEARER HE BEHELD WITHIN ITS ILLUMINATED CIRCLE HIS BROTHER CLERGYMAN--OR TO SPEAK MORE ACCURATELY HIS PROFESSIONAL FATHER AS WELL AS HIGHLY VALUED FRIEND--THE REVEREND MR WILSON WHO AS MR DIMMESDALE NOW CONJECTURED HAD BEEN PRAYING AT THE BEDSIDE OF SOME DYING MAN
THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE OLDEST INHABITANT WAS AT ONCE SETTLED WHEN I LOOKED AT THEM
A MOCKERY INDEED BUT IN WHICH HIS SOUL TRIFLED WITH ITSELF
XIV
IT WENT WITH ME ON MY SEA-SHORE WALKS AND RAMBLES INTO THE COUNTRY WHENEVER--WHICH WAS SELDOM AND RELUCTANTLY--I BESTIRRED MYSELF TO SEEK THAT INVIGORATING CHARM OF NATURE WHICH USED TO GIVE ME SUCH FRESHNESS AND ACTIVITY OF THOUGHT THE MOMENT THAT I STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE OLD MANSE
FOR SO CONFUSED WAS HIS REMEMBRANCE THAT HE HAD ALMOST BROUGHT HIMSELF TO LOOK AT THE EVENTS OF THE PAST NIGHT AS VISIONARY
NOR EVEN IN THE FULL CAREER OF HIS RECKLESS LIFE WAS HE REGARDED AS A PERSONAGE WITH WHOM IT WAS DISREPUTABLE TO TRAFFIC OR CASUALLY ASSOCIATE
IT WAS WHISPERED BY THOSE WHO PEERED AFTER HER THAT THE SCARLET LETTER THREW A LURID GLEAM ALONG THE DARK PASSAGE-WAY OF THE INTERIOR
BUT WAS SOON AS IMPERIOUS TO BE LET DOWN AGAIN AND FRISKED ONWARD BEFORE HESTER ON THE GRASSY PATHWAY WITH MANY A HARMLESS TRIP AND TUMBLE
THINK NOT THAT I SHALL INTERFERE WITH HEAVEN'S OWN METHOD OF RETRIBUTION OR TO MY OWN LOSS BETRAY HIM TO THE GRIPE OF HUMAN LAW
HERE TOO COMES HIS OWNER CHEERFUL SOMBRE GRACIOUS OR IN THE SULKS ACCORDINGLY AS HIS SCHEME OF THE NOW ACCOMPLISHED VOYAGE HAS BEEN REALIZED IN MERCHANDISE THAT WILL READILY BE TURNED TO GOLD OR HAS BURIED HIM UNDER A BULK OF INCOMMODITIES SUCH AS NOBODY WILL CARE TO RID HIM OF
THAT LOOK OF NAUGHTY MERRIMENT WAS LIKEWISE REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR WITH SO MUCH BREADTH AND INTENSITY OF EFFECT THAT IT MADE HESTER PRYNNE FEEL AS IF IT COULD NOT BE THE IMAGE OF HER OWN CHILD BUT OF AN IMP WHO WAS SEEKING TO MOULD ITSELF INTO PEARL'S SHAPE
AT THE VERY LEAST THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT THE BRAND OF A HOT IRON ON HESTER PRYNNE'S FOREHEAD
FROM BENEATH THEIR BROAD-BRIMMED HATS OF PALM-LEAF GLEAMED EYES WHICH EVEN IN GOOD-NATURE AND MERRIMENT HAD A KIND OF ANIMAL FEROCITY
THEY NOW FELT THEMSELVES AT LEAST INHABITANTS OF THE SAME SPHERE
AND BE THE STERN AND SAD TRUTH SPOKEN THAT THE BREACH WHICH GUILT HAS ONCE MADE INTO THE HUMAN SOUL IS NEVER IN THIS MORTAL STATE REPAIRED
THE MINISTER IN A MAZE AS THE MINISTER DEPARTED IN ADVANCE OF HESTER PRYNNE AND LITTLE PEARL HE THREW A BACKWARD GLANCE HALF EXPECTING THAT HE SHOULD DISCOVER ONLY SOME FAINTLY TRACED FEATURES OR OUTLINE OF THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD SLOWLY FADING INTO THE TWILIGHT OF THE WOODS
FAR READIER THAN THE COLLECTOR'S JUNIOR CLERK WHO AT NINETEEN YEARS WAS MUCH THE ELDER AND GRAVER MAN OF THE TWO
WHILE THIS PASSED HESTER PRYNNE HAD BEEN STANDING ON HER PEDESTAL STILL WITH A FIXED GAZE TOWARDS THE STRANGER--SO FIXED A GAZE THAT AT MOMENTS OF INTENSE ABSORPTION ALL OTHER OBJECTS IN THE VISIBLE WORLD SEEMED TO VANISH LEAVING ONLY HIM AND HER
BUT--OR ELSE HESTER'S FEARS DECEIVED HER--IT LACKED REFERENCE AND ADAPTATION TO THE WORLD INTO WHICH SHE WAS BORN
NEVER ON NEW ENGLAND SOIL HAD STOOD THE MAN SO HONOURED BY HIS MORTAL BRETHREN AS THE PREACHER
NOW WHY THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE CONSIDERED IT SO VERY FORTUNATE WE HESITATE TO REVEAL
IN FINE THE GOSSIPS OF THAT DAY BELIEVED--AND MR SURVEYOR PUE WHO MADE INVESTIGATIONS A CENTURY LATER BELIEVED--AND ONE OF HIS RECENT SUCCESSORS IN OFFICE MOREOVER FAITHFULLY BELIEVES--THAT PEARL WAS NOT ONLY ALIVE BUT MARRIED AND HAPPY AND MINDFUL OF HER MOTHER
NOTHING WAS MORE COMMON IN THOSE DAYS THAN TO INTERPRET ALL METEORIC APPEARANCES AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA THAT OCCURRED WITH LESS REGULARITY THAN THE RISE AND SET OF SUN AND MOON AS SO MANY REVELATIONS FROM A SUPERNATURAL SOURCE
OR PERHAPS IN THE MISANTHROPY OF HER OWN TROUBLE SHE LEFT THE MINISTER TO BEAR WHAT SHE MIGHT PICTURE TO HERSELF AS A MORE TOLERABLE DOOM
A WRITHING HORROR TWISTED ITSELF ACROSS HIS FEATURES LIKE A SNAKE GLIDING SWIFTLY OVER THEM AND MAKING ONE LITTLE PAUSE WITH ALL ITS WREATHED INTERVOLUTIONS IN OPEN SIGHT
CLUSTER ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS TOGETHER AS THEY SOMETIMES WERE WITH OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ONES TO DIVERSIFY THE GROUP AND FOR THE TIME BEING IT MADE THE CUSTOM-HOUSE A STIRRING SCENE
NAY FROM THE MOMENT WHEN WE CAME DOWN THE OLD CHURCH-STEPS TOGETHER A MARRIED PAIR I MIGHT HAVE BEHELD THE BALE-FIRE OF THAT SCARLET LETTER BLAZING AT THE END OF OUR PATH THOU KNOWEST SAID HESTER--FOR DEPRESSED AS SHE WAS SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THIS LAST QUIET STAB AT THE TOKEN OF HER SHAME--"THOU KNOWEST THAT I WAS FRANK WITH THEE
HE STARTED AT A THOUGHT THAT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM
WHAT SHOULD AIL ME TO HARM THIS MISBEGOTTEN AND MISERABLE BABE
IN ARTHUR DIMMESDALE THOUGHT AND IMAGINATION WERE SO ACTIVE AND SENSIBILITY SO INTENSE THAT THE BODILY INFIRMITY WOULD BE LIKELY TO HAVE ITS GROUNDWORK THERE
IT WAS THE OBSERVATION OF THOSE WHO BEHELD HIM NOW THAT NEVER SINCE MR DIMMESDALE FIRST SET HIS FOOT ON THE NEW ENGLAND SHORE HAD HE EXHIBITED SUCH ENERGY AS WAS SEEN IN THE GAIT AND AIR WITH WHICH HE KEPT HIS PACE IN THE PROCESSION
KNOWING YOUR NATURAL TEMPER BETTER THAN I HE COULD THE BETTER JUDGE WHAT ARGUMENTS TO USE WHETHER OF TENDERNESS OR TERROR SUCH AS MIGHT PREVAIL OVER YOUR HARDNESS AND OBSTINACY INSOMUCH THAT YOU SHOULD NO LONGER HIDE THE NAME OF HIM WHO TEMPTED YOU TO THIS GRIEVOUS FALL
WHAT KNOW I OF THE MINISTER'S HEART
THE SAILOR OF THAT DAY WOULD GO NEAR TO BE ARRAIGNED AS A PIRATE IN OUR OWN
THESE PERCEPTIONS HAD COME TOO LATE
IT HAD BEEN WROUGHT AS WAS EASY TO PERCEIVE WITH WONDERFUL SKILL OF NEEDLEWORK
I TOOK IT IN GOOD PART AT THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE THAT I WAS THROWN INTO A POSITION SO LITTLE AKIN TO MY PAST HABITS
IN FURTHERANCE OF THIS CHOICE IT SO HAPPENED THAT A SHIP LAY IN THE HARBOUR
HE NOW DUG INTO THE POOR CLERGYMAN'S HEART LIKE A MINER SEARCHING FOR GOLD
A PARTY OF INDIANS--IN THEIR SAVAGE FINERY OF CURIOUSLY EMBROIDERED DEERSKIN ROBES WAMPUM-BELTS RED AND YELLOW OCHRE AND FEATHERS AND ARMED WITH THE BOW AND ARROW AND STONE-HEADED SPEAR--STOOD APART WITH COUNTENANCES OF INFLEXIBLE GRAVITY BEYOND WHAT EVEN THE PURITAN ASPECT COULD ATTAIN
MEANWHILE THEY SHALL BE AT THE COMMAND OF ANY GENTLEMAN INCLINED AND COMPETENT TO TAKE THE UNPROFITABLE LABOUR OFF MY HANDS
TO SAY THE TRUTH THERE WAS MUCH NEED OF PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE NOT MERELY FOR HESTER HERSELF BUT STILL MORE URGENTLY FOR THE CHILD--WHO DRAWING ITS SUSTENANCE FROM THE MATERNAL BOSOM SEEMED TO HAVE DRANK IN WITH IT ALL THE TURMOIL THE ANGUISH AND DESPAIR WHICH PERVADED THE MOTHER'S SYSTEM
THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG TO SEEK
THE UNHAPPY CULPRIT SUSTAINED HERSELF AS BEST A WOMAN MIGHT UNDER THE HEAVY WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND UNRELENTING EYES ALL FASTENED UPON HER AND CONCENTRATED AT HER BOSOM
BUT THE CHILD HATH STRONG AFFECTIONS
AN EFFECT--WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE OBSERVABLE MORE OR LESS IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS OCCUPIED THE POSITION--IS THAT WHILE HE LEANS ON THE MIGHTY ARM OF THE REPUBLIC HIS OWN PROPER STRENGTH DEPARTS FROM HIM
YOUR CLUTCH IS ON HIS LIFE AND YOU CAUSE HIM TO DIE DAILY A LIVING DEATH AND STILL HE KNOWS YOU NOT
THIS PHENOMENON IN THE VARIOUS SHAPES WHICH IT ASSUMED INDICATED NO EXTERNAL CHANGE BUT SO SUDDEN AND IMPORTANT A CHANGE IN THE SPECTATOR OF THE FAMILIAR SCENE THAT THE INTERVENING SPACE OF A SINGLE DAY HAD OPERATED ON HIS CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE THE LAPSE OF YEARS
THE DEVIL KNEW IT WELL AND FRETTED IT CONTINUALLY WITH THE TOUCH OF HIS BURNING FINGER BUT HE HID IT CUNNINGLY FROM MEN AND WALKED AMONG YOU WITH THE MIEN OF A SPIRIT MOURNFUL BECAUSE SO PURE IN A SINFUL WORLD!--AND SAD BECAUSE HE MISSED HIS HEAVENLY KINDRED
AND BEHOLD HERE THE UNHAPPY WOMAN HESTER PRYNNE HER MOTHER SAYEST THOU SO CRIED THE GOVERNOR
HIS FORM GREW EMACIATED
AND HERE HIS DESCENDANTS HAVE BEEN BORN AND DIED AND HAVE MINGLED THEIR EARTHLY SUBSTANCE WITH THE SOIL UNTIL NO SMALL PORTION OF IT MUST NECESSARILY BE AKIN TO THE MORTAL FRAME WHEREWITH FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WALK THE STREETS
HE TURNED TOWARDS THE SCAFFOLD AND STRETCHED FORTH HIS ARMS
IN THE OTHER IT MORE RESEMBLES THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLOW OF DECAYING WOOD
SHOW FREELY TO THE WORLD IF NOT YOUR WORST YET SOME TRAIT WHEREBY THE WORST MAY BE INFERRED NOTHING WAS MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE CHANGE WHICH TOOK PLACE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER MR DIMMESDALE'S DEATH IN THE APPEARANCE AND DEMEANOUR OF THE OLD MAN KNOWN AS ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
SO MUCH STRENGTH OF COLOURING WHICH MUST HAVE GIVEN A WAN AND PALLID ASPECT TO CHEEKS OF A FAINTER BLOOM WAS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED TO PEARL'S BEAUTY AND MADE HER THE VERY BRIGHTEST LITTLE JET OF FLAME THAT EVER DANCED UPON THE EARTH
BUT THE DAYLIGHT OF THIS WORLD SHALL NOT SEE OUR MEETING PEARL LAUGHED AGAIN
EVEN THE OLD INSPECTOR WAS DESIRABLE AS A CHANGE OF DIET TO A MAN WHO HAD KNOWN ALCOTT
WELL WELL
THIS BODY OF SOLDIERY--WHICH STILL SUSTAINS A CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND MARCHES DOWN FROM PAST AGES WITH AN ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE FAME--WAS COMPOSED OF NO MERCENARY MATERIALS
NO MAN FOR ANY CONSIDERABLE PERIOD CAN WEAR ONE FACE TO HIMSELF AND ANOTHER TO THE MULTITUDE WITHOUT FINALLY GETTING BEWILDERED AS TO WHICH MAY BE THE TRUE
SWEAR IT REJOINED HE
AS WITH THESE SO WITH THE CHILD
ALL SHALL BE WELL
IN ALL THINGS ELSE I HAVE STRIVEN TO BE TRUE
THIS UNHAPPY PERSON HAD EFFECTED SUCH A TRANSFORMATION BY DEVOTING HIMSELF FOR SEVEN YEARS TO THE CONSTANT ANALYSIS OF A HEART FULL OF TORTURE AND DERIVING HIS ENJOYMENT THENCE AND ADDING FUEL TO THOSE FIERY TORTURES WHICH HE ANALYSED AND GLOATED OVER
SHE MADE A VERY GRAND APPEARANCE HAVING ON A HIGH HEAD-DRESS A RICH GOWN OF VELVET AND A RUFF DONE UP WITH THE FAMOUS YELLOW STARCH OF WHICH ANNE TURNER HER ESPECIAL FRIEND HAD TAUGHT HER THE SECRET BEFORE THIS LAST GOOD LADY HAD BEEN HANGED FOR SIR THOMAS OVERBURY'S MURDER
A LARGE NUMBER--AND MANY OF THESE WERE PERSONS OF SUCH SOBER SENSE AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATION THAT THEIR OPINIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN VALUABLE IN OTHER MATTERS--AFFIRMED THAT ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S ASPECT HAD UNDERGONE A REMARKABLE CHANGE WHILE HE HAD DWELT IN TOWN AND ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS ABODE WITH MR DIMMESDALE
FIRST CAME THE MUSIC
BUT WITH THE THIRTEEN STRIPES TURNED VERTICALLY INSTEAD OF HORIZONTALLY AND THUS INDICATING THAT A CIVIL AND NOT A MILITARY POST OF UNCLE SAM'S GOVERNMENT IS HERE ESTABLISHED
THERE IS HAPPINESS TO BE ENJOYED
THE OBJECTS THAT HAD MADE A SHADOW HITHERTO EMBODIED THE BRIGHTNESS NOW
PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION THERE IS A DEARTH OF RECORDS
HERE THE PALE CLERGYMAN PILED UP HIS LIBRARY RICH WITH PARCHMENT-BOUND FOLIOS OF THE FATHERS AND THE LORE OF RABBIS AND MONKISH ERUDITION OF WHICH THE PROTESTANT DIVINES EVEN WHILE THEY VILIFIED AND DECRIED THAT CLASS OF WRITERS WERE YET CONSTRAINED OFTEN TO AVAIL THEMSELVES
NOW AFTER HE HAD WON THE CROWN OF MARTYRDOM THOUGH WITH NO LONGER A HEAD TO WEAR IT ON THE POINT MIGHT BE LOOKED UPON AS SETTLED
THOU TOO HAST DEEPLY SINNED HE WITHDREW HIS DYING EYES FROM THE OLD MAN AND FIXED THEM ON THE WOMAN AND THE CHILD
IT WAS DOUBTLESS CAUSED BY ONE OF THOSE METEORS WHICH THE NIGHT-WATCHER MAY SO OFTEN OBSERVE BURNING OUT TO WASTE IN THE VACANT REGIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE FLUNG AWAY ALL THE GOLDEN GRAIN OF PRACTICAL WISDOM WHICH THEY HAD ENJOYED SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF HARVESTING AND MOST CAREFULLY TO HAVE STORED THEIR MEMORY WITH THE HUSKS
AFTER GROWING FASTIDIOUS BY SYMPATHY WITH THE CLASSIC REFINEMENT OF HILLARD'S CULTURE
SHE WILL NOT SPEAK DISCERNING THE IMPRACTICABLE STATE OF THE POOR CULPRIT'S MIND THE ELDER CLERGYMAN WHO HAD CAREFULLY PREPARED HIMSELF FOR THE OCCASION ADDRESSED TO THE MULTITUDE A DISCOURSE ON SIN IN ALL ITS BRANCHES BUT WITH CONTINUAL REFERENCE TO THE IGNOMINIOUS LETTER
ITS CONVULSIVE TOSSINGS GRADUALLY CEASED
THE COMPLAINT OF A HUMAN HEART SORROW-LADEN PERCHANCE GUILTY TELLING ITS SECRET WHETHER OF GUILT OR SORROW TO THE GREAT HEART OF MANKIND
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH ARRANGED HIS STUDY AND LABORATORY
WERE IT NOT BETTER SAID HE THAT YOU USE MY POOR SKILL TONIGHT
BUT SHE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HER FORMER MOOD BY THE SHIMMER OF THE SUNSHINE ON THE WEAPONS AND BRIGHT ARMOUR OF THE MILITARY COMPANY WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER THE MUSIC AND FORMED THE HONORARY ESCORT OF THE PROCESSION
THE CHAIN THAT BOUND HER HERE WAS OF IRON LINKS AND GALLING TO HER INMOST SOUL BUT COULD NEVER BE BROKEN
MORNING CAME AND PEEPED BLUSHING THROUGH THE CURTAINS
NO FEAR OF SCURVY OR SHIP FEVER THIS VOYAGE
OR RATHER LIKE A SEXTON DELVING INTO A GRAVE POSSIBLY IN QUEST OF A JEWEL THAT HAD BEEN BURIED ON THE DEAD MAN'S BOSOM BUT LIKELY TO FIND NOTHING SAVE MORTALITY AND CORRUPTION
AND YET WITHAL SO CUNNINGLY HAD THE FEW MATERIALS OF HIS CHARACTER BEEN PUT TOGETHER THAT THERE WAS NO PAINFUL PERCEPTION OF DEFICIENCY BUT ON MY PART AN ENTIRE CONTENTMENT WITH WHAT I FOUND IN HIM
SINCE HIS INACTIVITY IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS--HIS TENDENCY TO ROAM AT WILL IN THAT BROAD AND QUIET FIELD WHERE ALL MANKIND MAY MEET RATHER THAN CONFINE HIMSELF TO THOSE NARROW PATHS WHERE BRETHREN OF THE SAME HOUSEHOLD MUST DIVERGE FROM ONE ANOTHER--HAD SOMETIMES MADE IT QUESTIONABLE WITH HIS BROTHER DEMOCRATS WHETHER HE WAS A FRIEND
WHAT IS THAT THE MINISTER SEEKS TO HIDE WITH HIS HAND ALWAYS OVER HIS HEART
BUT TOUCHING YOUR MEDICINE KIND SIR IN MY PRESENT FRAME OF BODY I NEED IT NOT I JOY TO HEAR IT ANSWERED THE PHYSICIAN
A CROWD OF EAGER AND CURIOUS SCHOOLBOYS UNDERSTANDING LITTLE OF THE MATTER IN HAND EXCEPT THAT IT GAVE THEM A HALF-HOLIDAY RAN BEFORE HER PROGRESS TURNING THEIR HEADS CONTINUALLY TO STARE INTO HER FACE AND AT THE WINKING BABY IN HER ARMS AND AT THE IGNOMINIOUS LETTER ON HER BREAST
BUT NOW THOU WILT PEARL KISSED HIS LIPS
WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY--A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
HESTER PRYNNE DID NOT NOW OCCUPY PRECISELY THE SAME POSITION IN WHICH WE BEHELD HER DURING THE EARLIER PERIODS OF HER IGNOMINY
AS THIS ANCIENT LADY HAD THE RENOWN WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY COST HER NO LESS A PRICE THAN HER LIFE OF BEING A PRINCIPAL ACTOR IN ALL THE WORKS OF NECROMANCY THAT WERE CONTINUALLY GOING FORWARD THE CROWD GAVE WAY BEFORE HER AND SEEMED TO FEAR THE TOUCH OF HER GARMENT AS IF IT CARRIED THE PLAGUE AMONG ITS GORGEOUS FOLDS
BUT HOW COULD THE YOUNG MINISTER SAY SO WHEN WITH EVERY SUCCESSIVE SABBATH HIS CHEEK WAS PALER AND THINNER AND HIS VOICE MORE TREMULOUS THAN BEFORE--WHEN IT HAD NOW BECOME A CONSTANT HABIT RATHER THAN A CASUAL GESTURE TO PRESS HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
AN IMP OF EVIL EMBLEM AND PRODUCT OF SIN SHE HAD NO RIGHT AMONG CHRISTENED INFANTS
PEARL RESEMBLED THE BROOK INASMUCH AS THE CURRENT OF HER LIFE GUSHED FROM A WELL-SPRING AS MYSTERIOUS AND HAD FLOWED THROUGH SCENES SHADOWED AS HEAVILY WITH GLOOM
SO ETHEREALISED BY SPIRIT AS HE WAS AND SO APOTHEOSISED BY WORSHIPPING ADMIRERS DID HIS FOOTSTEPS IN THE PROCESSION REALLY TREAD UPON THE DUST OF EARTH
IT STRAGGLED ONWARD INTO THE MYSTERY OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST
BUT AT THAT INSTANT SHE BEHELD OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HIMSELF STANDING IN THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE MARKET-PLACE AND SMILING ON HER
EVEN POLITICAL POWER--AS IN THE CASE OF INCREASE MATHER--WAS WITHIN THE GRASP OF A SUCCESSFUL PRIEST
SHE INHERITED HER MOTHER'S GIFT FOR DEVISING DRAPERY AND COSTUME
IF THAT HAS NOT AVENGED ME I CAN DO NO MORE HE LAID HIS FINGER ON IT WITH A SMILE
SO THE MINISTER HAD NOT FALLEN ASLEEP AND DREAMED
THERE WAS WITCHCRAFT IN LITTLE PEARL'S EYES
THE GOOD OLD MINISTER CAME FRESHLY FROM THE DEATH-CHAMBER OF GOVERNOR WINTHROP WHO HAD PASSED FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN WITHIN THAT VERY HOUR
AND ON THIS SIMPLE SLAB OF SLATE--AS THE CURIOUS INVESTIGATOR MAY STILL DISCERN AND PERPLEX HIMSELF WITH THE PURPORT--THERE APPEARED THE SEMBLANCE OF AN ENGRAVED ESCUTCHEON
BUT THE TASK WAS BEYOND HER SKILL
IN ALL SEASONS OF CALAMITY INDEED WHETHER GENERAL OR OF INDIVIDUALS THE OUTCAST OF SOCIETY AT ONCE FOUND HER PLACE
AND YET A RUSSET GOWN TORN AND SOILED WITH THE CHILD'S RUDE PLAY MADE A PICTURE OF HER JUST AS PERFECT
AND UNDER MINE OWN ROOF
TO DETECT AS ONE OR ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME THE TREMOR OF A VOICE WHICH IN LONG-PAST DAYS HAD BEEN WONT TO BELLOW THROUGH A SPEAKING-TRUMPET HOARSELY ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN BOREAS HIMSELF TO SILENCE
IT APPEARED TO CONTAIN MEDICAL PREPARATIONS ONE OF WHICH HE MINGLED WITH A CUP OF WATER
I HAVE A NAMELESS HORROR OF THE MAN MINISTER SAID LITTLE PEARL I CAN TELL THEE WHO HE IS QUICKLY THEN CHILD SAID THE MINISTER BENDING HIS EAR CLOSE TO HER LIPS
SO POWERFUL IS SHE TO SUSTAIN--SO TENDER TO SOOTHE
BIOGRAPHY ETC
BUT ONE IDLE AND RAINY DAY IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO MAKE A DISCOVERY OF SOME LITTLE INTEREST
BUT WHY DOES HE NOT WEAR IT OUTSIDE HIS BOSOM AS THOU DOST MOTHER GO NOW CHILD AND THOU SHALT TEASE ME AS THOU WILT ANOTHER TIME CRIED HESTER PRYNNE
I TELL THEE HESTER PRYNNE THE RICHEST FEE THAT EVER PHYSICIAN EARNED FROM MONARCH COULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT SUCH CARE AS I HAVE WASTED ON THIS MISERABLE PRIEST
SOON FINDING HOWEVER THAT EITHER SHE OR THE IMAGE WAS UNREAL SHE TURNED ELSEWHERE FOR BETTER PASTIME
WAS NOT THE SECRET TOLD ME IN THE NATURAL RECOIL OF MY HEART AT THE FIRST SIGHT OF HIM AND AS OFTEN AS I HAVE SEEN HIM SINCE
IF THEY WOULD SERVE THEIR FELLOWMEN LET THEM DO IT BY MAKING MANIFEST THE POWER AND REALITY OF CONSCIENCE IN CONSTRAINING THEM TO PENITENTIAL SELF-ABASEMENT
THEY SAID THAT IT MEANT ABEL SO STRONG WAS HESTER PRYNNE WITH A WOMAN'S STRENGTH
THEN ASCENDED WITH IT AS IT ROSE THROUGH PROGRESSIVE GRADATIONS OF SWEETNESS AND POWER UNTIL ITS VOLUME SEEMED TO ENVELOP HER WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF AWE AND SOLEMN GRANDEUR
OH BROOK
I HAVE LONG SHRUNK FROM CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY OFTEN SHOW A DISTRUST--A BACKWARDNESS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH ME
AS IS APT TO BE THE CASE WHEN A PERSON STANDS OUT IN ANY PROMINENCE BEFORE THE COMMUNITY AND AT THE SAME TIME INTERFERES NEITHER WITH PUBLIC NOR INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS AND CONVENIENCE A SPECIES OF GENERAL REGARD HAD ULTIMATELY GROWN UP IN REFERENCE TO HESTER PRYNNE
THE MINISTER FELT FOR THE CHILD'S OTHER HAND AND TOOK IT
SINCE THAT WRETCHED EPOCH HE HAD WATCHED WITH MORBID ZEAL AND MINUTENESS NOT HIS ACTS--FOR THOSE IT WAS EASY TO ARRANGE--BUT EACH BREATH OF EMOTION AND HIS EVERY THOUGHT
PEARL MISSES SOMETHING THAT SHE HAS ALWAYS SEEN ME WEAR I PRAY YOU ANSWERED THE MINISTER IF THOU HAST ANY MEANS OF PACIFYING THE CHILD DO IT FORTHWITH
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME NOR THE SECOND THAT I HAD GONE AWAY--AS IT SEEMED PERMANENTLY--BUT YET RETURNED LIKE THE BAD HALFPENNY OR AS IF SALEM WERE FOR ME THE INEVITABLE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE
FOR INSTANCE HE MET ONE OF HIS OWN DEACONS
FOR HESTER PRYNNE'S SAKE THEN AND NO LESS FOR THE POOR CHILD'S SAKE LET US LEAVE THEM AS PROVIDENCE HATH SEEN FIT TO PLACE THEM YOU SPEAK MY FRIEND WITH A STRANGE EARNESTNESS SAID OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH SMILING AT HIM
ON THE OTHER HAND A PENALTY WHICH IN OUR DAYS WOULD INFER A DEGREE OF MOCKING INFAMY AND RIDICULE MIGHT THEN BE INVESTED WITH ALMOST AS STERN A DIGNITY AS THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH ITSELF
THE EXCITEMENT OF MR DIMMESDALE'S FEELINGS AS HE RETURNED FROM HIS INTERVIEW WITH HESTER LENT HIM UNACCUSTOMED PHYSICAL ENERGY AND HURRIED HIM TOWNWARD AT A RAPID PACE
SHE WAS SELF-ORDAINED A SISTER OF MERCY OR WE MAY RATHER SAY THE WORLD'S HEAVY HAND HAD SO ORDAINED HER WHEN NEITHER THE WORLD NOR SHE LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS RESULT
THESE OLD GENTLEMEN--SEATED LIKE MATTHEW AT THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM BUT NOT VERY LIABLE TO BE SUMMONED THENCE LIKE HIM FOR APOSTOLIC ERRANDS--WERE CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICERS
AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHEREVER HESTER STOOD A SMALL VACANT AREA--A SORT OF MAGIC CIRCLE--HAD FORMED ITSELF ABOUT HER INTO WHICH THOUGH THE PEOPLE WERE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER AT A LITTLE DISTANCE NONE VENTURED OR FELT DISPOSED TO INTRUDE
WELL FOR THEE FOOLISH CHILD THAT THOU DIDST NOT SPEAK TO HIM ANOTHER SHADE OF THE SAME SENTIMENT IN REFERENCE TO MR DIMMESDALE WAS EXPRESSED BY A PERSON WHOSE ECCENTRICITIES--INSANITY AS WE SHOULD TERM IT--LED HER TO DO WHAT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE WOULD HAVE VENTURED ON--TO BEGIN A CONVERSATION WITH THE WEARER OF THE SCARLET LETTER IN PUBLIC
A FLOOD OF SUNSHINE CHAPTER XIX
HIM THE MAN OF ETHEREAL ATTRIBUTES WHOSE VOICE THE ANGELS MIGHT ELSE HAVE LISTENED TO AND ANSWERED
ELSE IT MAY BE THEIR MISERABLE FORTUNE AS IT WAS ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S WHEN SOME MIGHTIER TOUCH THAN THEIR OWN MAY HAVE AWAKENED ALL HER SENSIBILITIES TO BE REPROACHED EVEN FOR THE CALM CONTENT THE MARBLE IMAGE OF HAPPINESS WHICH THEY WILL HAVE IMPOSED UPON HER AS THE WARM REALITY
IT CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TOWARDS A MAN'S MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL HEALTH TO BE BROUGHT INTO HABITS OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH INDIVIDUALS UNLIKE HIMSELF WHO CARE LITTLE FOR HIS PURSUITS AND WHOSE SPHERE AND ABILITIES HE MUST GO OUT OF HIMSELF TO APPRECIATE
THE LAST WAS WHEN THOU LEDST HER WITH THEE TO THE HOUSE OF YONDER STERN OLD GOVERNOR AND THOU DIDST PLEAD SO BRAVELY IN HER BEHALF AND MINE ANSWERED THE MOTHER
IN THIS STATE THE VOICE OF THE PREACHER THUNDERED REMORSELESSLY BUT UNAVAILINGLY UPON HER EARS
METHOUGHT--OH HESTER WHAT A THOUGHT IS THAT AND HOW TERRIBLE TO DREAD IT!--THAT MY OWN FEATURES WERE PARTLY REPEATED IN HER FACE AND SO STRIKINGLY THAT THE WORLD MIGHT SEE THEM
AHA
AHA
FULL OF CONCERN THEREFORE--BUT SO CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN RIGHT THAT IT SEEMED SCARCELY AN UNEQUAL MATCH BETWEEN THE PUBLIC ON THE ONE SIDE AND A LONELY WOMAN BACKED BY THE SYMPATHIES OF NATURE ON THE OTHER--HESTER PRYNNE SET FORTH FROM HER SOLITARY COTTAGE
SHE HAD DARK AND ABUNDANT HAIR SO GLOSSY THAT IT THREW OFF THE SUNSHINE WITH A GLEAM
AND THAT UGLY TEMPERED LADY OLD MISTRESS HIBBINS WAS ONE
THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE PARADE
FOR IF WE DEEM IT OTHERWISE DO WE NOT THEREBY SAY THAT THE HEAVENLY FATHER THE CREATOR OF ALL FLESH HATH LIGHTLY RECOGNISED A DEED OF SIN AND MADE OF NO ACCOUNT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNHALLOWED LUST AND HOLY LOVE
THEN TOO THE PEOPLE WERE COUNTENANCED IF NOT ENCOURAGED IN RELAXING THE SEVERE AND CLOSE APPLICATION TO THEIR VARIOUS MODES OF RUGGED INDUSTRY WHICH AT ALL OTHER TIMES SEEMED OF THE SAME PIECE AND MATERIAL WITH THEIR RELIGION
IT WAS NOT PAINFUL TO BEHOLD THIS LOOK
BUT THE CHILD UNACCUSTOMED TO THE TOUCH OR FAMILIARITY OF ANY BUT HER MOTHER ESCAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW AND STOOD ON THE UPPER STEP LOOKING LIKE A WILD TROPICAL BIRD OF RICH PLUMAGE READY TO TAKE FLIGHT INTO THE UPPER AIR
AND I PROMISE YE MISTRESS PRYNNE SHALL BE SET WHERE MAN WOMAN AND CHILD MAY HAVE A FAIR SIGHT OF HER BRAVE APPAREL FROM THIS TIME TILL AN HOUR PAST MERIDIAN
THE NEXT INSTANT BACK IT ALL RUSHED AGAIN WITH STILL A DEEPER THROB OF PAIN
NEVERTHELESS LIKE THE GREATER PART OF OUR MISFORTUNES EVEN SO SERIOUS A CONTINGENCY BRINGS ITS REMEDY AND CONSOLATION WITH IT IF THE SUFFERER WILL BUT MAKE THE BEST RATHER THAN THE WORST OF THE ACCIDENT WHICH HAS BEFALLEN HIM
NONE SO READY AS SHE TO GIVE OF HER LITTLE SUBSTANCE TO EVERY DEMAND OF POVERTY EVEN THOUGH THE BITTER-HEARTED PAUPER THREW BACK A GIBE IN REQUITAL OF THE FOOD BROUGHT REGULARLY TO HIS DOOR OR THE GARMENTS WROUGHT FOR HIM BY THE FINGERS THAT COULD HAVE EMBROIDERED A MONARCH'S ROBE
THE INTERIOR OF A HEART CHAPTER XII
HATH SHE NOT EXPRESSED THIS THOUGHT IN THE GARB OF THE POOR CHILD SO FORCIBLY REMINDING US OF THAT RED SYMBOL WHICH SEARS HER BOSOM WELL SAID AGAIN CRIED GOOD MR WILSON
HERE IS A CHILD OF THREE YEARS OLD AND SHE CANNOT TELL WHO MADE HER
HER GARB WAS ALL OF ONE IDEA WITH HER NATURE
ALL CAME FORTH TO MOVE IN PROCESSION BEFORE THE PEOPLE'S EYE AND THUS IMPART A NEEDED DIGNITY TO THE SIMPLE FRAMEWORK OF A GOVERNMENT SO NEWLY CONSTRUCTED
IT WAS IN SUFFICIENT PROXIMITY TO BRING THE WHOLE SERMON TO HER EARS IN THE SHAPE OF AN INDISTINCT BUT VARIED MURMUR AND FLOW OF THE MINISTER'S VERY PECULIAR VOICE
HIS REMINISCENCES OF GOOD CHEER HOWEVER ANCIENT THE DATE OF THE ACTUAL BANQUET SEEMED TO BRING THE SAVOUR OF PIG OR TURKEY UNDER ONE'S VERY NOSTRILS
LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT--A FREE-BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
ALL HIS STRENGTH AND ENERGY--ALL HIS VITAL AND INTELLECTUAL FORCE--SEEMED AT ONCE TO DESERT HIM INSOMUCH THAT HE POSITIVELY WITHERED UP SHRIVELLED AWAY AND ALMOST VANISHED FROM MORTAL SIGHT LIKE AN UPROOTED WEED THAT LIES WILTING IN THE SUN
COULD I HAVE PRESERVED THE PICTURESQUE FORCE OF HIS STYLE AND THE HUMOUROUS COLOURING WHICH NATURE TAUGHT HIM HOW TO THROW OVER HIS DESCRIPTIONS THE RESULT I HONESTLY BELIEVE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING NEW IN LITERATURE
JULIAN HAWTHORNE NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE AND HIS WIFE 1885
THE COLLECTOR'S JUNIOR CLERK TOO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO IT WAS WHISPERED OCCASIONALLY COVERED A SHEET OF UNCLE SAM'S LETTER PAPER WITH WHAT AT THE DISTANCE OF A FEW YARDS LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE POETRY--USED NOW AND THEN TO SPEAK TO ME OF BOOKS AS MATTERS WITH WHICH I MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CONVERSANT
TWO OR THREE WOODEN-BOTTOM CHAIRS EXCEEDINGLY DECREPIT AND INFIRM
PEARL FELT THE SENTIMENT AND REQUITED IT WITH THE BITTEREST HATRED THAT CAN BE SUPPOSED TO RANKLE IN A CHILDISH BOSOM
ROGER CHILLINGWORTH POSSESSED ALL OR MOST OF THE ATTRIBUTES ABOVE ENUMERATED
ALL THESE GIANT TREES AND BOULDERS OF GRANITE SEEMED INTENT ON MAKING A MYSTERY OF THE COURSE OF THIS SMALL BROOK
HE HAS WASHED HIS SOOTY FACE AND PUT ON HIS SABBATH-DAY CLOTHES AND LOOKS AS IF HE WOULD GLADLY BE MERRY IF ANY KIND BODY WOULD ONLY TEACH HIM HOW
YOU WILL SHORTLY NEED IT
BUT THE LARGER PART OF THEM FOUNDERED NEAR THE SHORE
THERE IS THE LITTLE DOMESTIC SCENERY OF THE WELL-KNOWN APARTMENT
IT WAS WELL FOR THEIR VENERABLE BROTHERHOOD THAT THE NEW SURVEYOR WAS NOT A POLITICIAN AND THOUGH A FAITHFUL DEMOCRAT IN PRINCIPLE NEITHER RECEIVED NOR HELD HIS OFFICE WITH ANY REFERENCE TO POLITICAL SERVICES
HE WAS NOW KNOWN TO BE A MAN OF SKILL
IT WAS THIS PROFOUND AND CONTINUAL UNDERTONE THAT GAVE THE CLERGYMAN HIS MOST APPROPRIATE POWER
SHE WITHDREW HER HAND FROM MR DIMMESDALE'S AND POINTED ACROSS THE STREET
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT PERSONS WHO SPECULATE THE MOST BOLDLY OFTEN CONFORM WITH THE MOST PERFECT QUIETUDE TO THE EXTERNAL REGULATIONS OF SOCIETY
IT WAS THE OLD DAME IN THE CHIMNEY CORNER AT THE HOUSE WHERE YOU WATCHED LAST NIGHT SAID THE CHILD
THE ENTIRE ARRAY MOREOVER CLAD IN BURNISHED STEEL AND WITH PLUMAGE NODDING OVER THEIR BRIGHT MORIONS HAD A BRILLIANCY OF EFFECT WHICH NO MODERN DISPLAY CAN ASPIRE TO EQUAL
NOR MUST WE FORGET THE CAPTAINS OF THE RUSTY LITTLE SCHOONERS THAT BRING FIREWOOD FROM THE BRITISH PROVINCES
REMOTE THOUGH WE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE HIS CHAIR
IT WAS IN SHORT THE PLATFORM OF THE PILLORY
THE WHEEL-TRACK LITTLE WORN AND EVEN IN THE MARKET-PLACE MARGINED WITH GREEN ON EITHER SIDE--ALL WERE VISIBLE BUT WITH A SINGULARITY OF ASPECT THAT SEEMED TO GIVE ANOTHER MORAL INTERPRETATION TO THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD THAN THEY HAD EVER BORNE BEFORE
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT MURMURED HE--"I DID KNOW IT
AND THAT MOREOVER WITHOUT SERVING A PURPOSE IN THEIR DAY AS THESE HEAPED-UP PAPERS HAD AND--SADDEST OF ALL--WITHOUT PURCHASING FOR THEIR WRITERS THE COMFORTABLE LIVELIHOOD WHICH THE CLERKS OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE HAD GAINED BY THESE WORTHLESS SCRATCHINGS OF THE PEN
ALL THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH A SUBTLETY SO PERFECT THAT THE MINISTER THOUGH HE HAD CONSTANTLY A DIM PERCEPTION OF SOME EVIL INFLUENCE WATCHING OVER HIM COULD NEVER GAIN A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS ACTUAL NATURE
IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TOO AS IT HAS BEEN THAT OF MANY OTHER PIOUS PURITANS TO FAST--NOT HOWEVER LIKE THEM IN ORDER TO PURIFY THE BODY AND RENDER IT THE FITTER MEDIUM OF CELESTIAL ILLUMINATION--BUT RIGOROUSLY AND UNTIL HIS KNEES TREMBLED BENEATH HIM AS AN ACT OF PENANCE
BUT THIS VERY BURDEN IT WAS THAT GAVE HIM SYMPATHIES SO INTIMATE WITH THE SINFUL BROTHERHOOD OF MANKIND
IT WILL SOON BE GONE PEARL SET FORTH AT A GREAT PACE AND AS HESTER SMILED TO PERCEIVE DID ACTUALLY CATCH THE SUNSHINE AND STOOD LAUGHING IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL BRIGHTENED BY ITS SPLENDOUR AND SCINTILLATING WITH THE VIVACITY EXCITED BY RAPID MOTION
AGAIN AT THE FIRST INSTANT OF PERCEIVING THAT THIN VISAGE AND THE SLIGHT DEFORMITY OF THE FIGURE SHE PRESSED HER INFANT TO HER BOSOM WITH SO CONVULSIVE A FORCE THAT THE POOR BABE UTTERED ANOTHER CRY OF PAIN
DEEP RUFFS PAINFULLY WROUGHT BANDS AND GORGEOUSLY EMBROIDERED GLOVES WERE ALL DEEMED NECESSARY TO THE OFFICIAL STATE OF MEN ASSUMING THE REINS OF POWER AND WERE READILY ALLOWED TO INDIVIDUALS DIGNIFIED BY RANK OR WEALTH EVEN WHILE SUMPTUARY LAWS FORBADE THESE AND SIMILAR EXTRAVAGANCES TO THE PLEBEIAN ORDER
HE USUALLY KEEPS HIS GROUND JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR HIS OWN RUIN AND IS THEN THRUST OUT WITH SINEWS ALL UNSTRUNG TO TOTTER ALONG THE DIFFICULT FOOTPATH OF LIFE AS HE BEST MAY
CANST THOU DEEM IT HESTER A CONSOLATION THAT I MUST STAND UP IN MY PULPIT AND MEET SO MANY EYES TURNED UPWARD TO MY FACE AS IF THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN WERE BEAMING FROM IT!--MUST SEE MY FLOCK HUNGRY FOR THE TRUTH AND LISTENING TO MY WORDS AS IF A TONGUE OF PENTECOST WERE SPEAKING!--AND THEN LOOK INWARD AND DISCERN THE BLACK REALITY OF WHAT THEY IDOLISE
BECAUSE THERE WAS AT LEAST AN INTELLIGIBLE EARNESTNESS IN THE MOOD INSTEAD OF THE FITFUL CAPRICE THAT SO OFTEN THWARTED HER IN THE CHILD'S MANIFESTATIONS
RUSTY THROUGH LONG IDLENESS SOME LITTLE SPACE WAS REQUISITE BEFORE MY INTELLECTUAL MACHINERY COULD BE BROUGHT TO WORK UPON THE TALE WITH AN EFFECT IN ANY DEGREE SATISFACTORY
IN SPITE OF HIS PREMEDITATED CAREFULNESS THE FLOOR WOULD NOW AND THEN CREAK
HAWTHORNE'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAGAZINES WERE NUMEROUS AND MOST OF HIS TALES APPEARED FIRST IN PERIODICALS CHIEFLY IN THE TOKEN 1831-1838 NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE 1834,1835
BUT HOW TO AVOID IT
WHY DID I NOT UNDERSTAND
THERE WAS WILD AND GHASTLY SCENERY ALL AROUND HER AND A HOME AND COMFORT NOWHERE
ON THE THRESHOLD SHE PAUSED--TURNED PARTLY ROUND--FOR PERCHANCE THE IDEA OF ENTERING ALONE AND ALL SO CHANGED THE HOME OF SO INTENSE A FORMER LIFE WAS MORE DREARY AND DESOLATE THAN EVEN SHE COULD BEAR
BRED UP FROM BOYHOOD IN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE IT WAS HIS PROPER FIELD OF ACTIVITY
SHALL WE NOT SPEND OUR IMMORTAL LIFE TOGETHER
AND THE MANY INTRICACIES OF BUSINESS SO HARASSING TO THE INTERLOPER PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM WITH THE REGULARITY OF A PERFECTLY COMPREHENDED SYSTEM
IN THE YEAR THAT SAW IT PUBLISHED HE BEGAN THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES A LATER ROMANCE OR PROSE-TRAGEDY OF THE PURITAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AS HE HAD HIMSELF KNOWN IT DEFRAUDED OF ART AND THE JOY OF LIFE STARVING FOR SYMBOLS AS EMERSON HAS IT
THE EDIFICE--ORIGINALLY PROJECTED ON A SCALE ADAPTED TO THE OLD COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE OF THE PORT AND WITH AN IDEA OF SUBSEQUENT PROSPERITY DESTINED NEVER TO BE REALIZED--CONTAINS FAR MORE SPACE THAN ITS OCCUPANTS KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
THEY WERE STERN ENOUGH TO LOOK UPON HER DEATH HAD THAT BEEN THE SENTENCE WITHOUT A MURMUR AT ITS SEVERITY BUT HAD NONE OF THE HEARTLESSNESS OF ANOTHER SOCIAL STATE WHICH WOULD FIND ONLY A THEME FOR JEST IN AN EXHIBITION LIKE THE PRESENT
HE HAD A READY FACULTY INDEED OF ESCAPING FROM ANY TOPIC THAT AGITATED HIS TOO SENSITIVE AND NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT.--"BUT NOW I WOULD ASK OF MY WELL-SKILLED PHYSICIAN WHETHER IN GOOD SOOTH HE DEEMS ME TO HAVE PROFITED BY HIS KINDLY CARE OF THIS WEAK FRAME OF MINE BEFORE ROGER CHILLINGWORTH COULD ANSWER THEY HEARD THE CLEAR WILD LAUGHTER OF A YOUNG CHILD'S VOICE PROCEEDING FROM THE ADJACENT BURIAL-GROUND
LARGE QUANTITIES OF SIMILAR RUBBISH LAY LUMBERING THE FLOOR
THE SPELL OF LIFE WENT FORTH FROM HER EVER-CREATIVE SPIRIT AND COMMUNICATED ITSELF TO A THOUSAND OBJECTS AS A TORCH KINDLES A FLAME WHEREVER IT MAY BE APPLIED
WHEN SUNSHINE CAME AGAIN SHE WAS NOT THERE
WHY DOST THOU NOT COME TO ME EXCLAIMED HESTER
PEARL'S ASPECT WAS IMBUED WITH A SPELL OF INFINITE VARIETY
WHETHER THE WITCH HAD READ THE MINISTER'S THOUGHTS OR NO SHE CAME TO A FULL STOP LOOKED SHREWDLY INTO HIS FACE SMILED CRAFTILY AND--THOUGH LITTLE GIVEN TO CONVERSE WITH CLERGYMEN--BEGAN A CONVERSATION
HIS SON TOO INHERITED THE PERSECUTING SPIRIT AND MADE HIMSELF SO CONSPICUOUS IN THE MARTYRDOM OF THE WITCHES THAT THEIR BLOOD MAY FAIRLY BE SAID TO HAVE LEFT A STAIN UPON HIM
THERE IS NO GOOD FOR LITTLE PEARL
BUT HESTER THE MAN LIVES WHO HAS WRONGED US BOTH
AND THE SHAME!--THE INDELICACY!--THE HORRIBLE UGLINESS OF THIS EXPOSURE OF A SICK AND GUILTY HEART TO THE VERY EYE THAT WOULD GLOAT OVER IT
AND AS HESTER PRYNNE HAD NO SELFISH ENDS NOR LIVED IN ANY MEASURE FOR HER OWN PROFIT AND ENJOYMENT PEOPLE BROUGHT ALL THEIR SORROWS AND PERPLEXITIES AND BESOUGHT HER COUNSEL AS ONE WHO HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH A MIGHTY TROUBLE
ONCE IN MY LIFE I MET THE BLACK MAN SAID HER MOTHER
HESTER SHOOK HER HEAD
COME MY CHILD SAID HESTER LOOKING ABOUT HER FROM THE SPOT WHERE PEARL HAD STOOD STILL IN THE SUNSHINE--"WE WILL SIT DOWN A LITTLE WAY WITHIN THE WOOD AND REST OURSELVES I AM NOT AWEARY MOTHER REPLIED THE LITTLE GIRL
EVEN AS IN OUR OWN DAYS WE SCATTER GILDED VOLUMES ON THE CENTRE TABLE TO BE TURNED OVER BY THE CASUAL GUEST
AND AS FOR THE PEOPLE'S REVERENCE WOULD THAT IT WERE TURNED TO SCORN AND HATRED
AND WILL HE HOLD OUT BOTH HIS HANDS TO ME AS WHEN THOU LEDST ME TO HIM FROM THE BROOK-SIDE HE WILL BE THERE CHILD ANSWERED HER MOTHER BUT HE WILL NOT GREET THEE TO-DAY NOR MUST THOU GREET HIM WHAT A STRANGE SAD MAN IS HE SAID THE CHILD AS IF SPEAKING PARTLY TO HERSELF
THE NEW INHABITANT--WHO CAME HIMSELF FROM A FOREIGN LAND OR WHOSE FATHER OR GRANDFATHER CAME--HAS LITTLE CLAIM TO BE CALLED A SALEMITE
ACCORDING TO THE VULGAR IDEA THE FIRE IN HIS LABORATORY HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM THE LOWER REGIONS AND WAS FED WITH INFERNAL FUEL
SOMETIMES THE RED INFAMY UPON HER BREAST WOULD GIVE A SYMPATHETIC THROB AS SHE PASSED NEAR A VENERABLE MINISTER OR MAGISTRATE THE MODEL OF PIETY AND JUSTICE TO WHOM THAT AGE OF ANTIQUE REVERENCE LOOKED UP AS TO A MORTAL MAN IN FELLOWSHIP WITH ANGELS
WHENEVER THAT LOOK APPEARED IN HER WILD BRIGHT DEEPLY BLACK EYES IT INVESTED HER WITH A STRANGE REMOTENESS AND INTANGIBILITY
DETECTING HIS EMOTION PEARL CLAPPED HER LITTLE HANDS IN THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT ECSTACY
DOST THOU REMEMBER ME
THE ANGELS WERE FOR EVER POINTING AT IT
SUCH AN EXHIBITION HOWEVER WAS BUT TO BE PICTURED IN FANCY
THE TENDENCY OF HER FATE AND FORTUNES HAD BEEN TO SET HER FREE
THEN MUCH MORE THEE
NOT IMPROBABLY HE HAD NEVER BEFORE VIEWED HIMSELF AS HE DID NOW
SINCE ALL THE POWERS OF NATURE CALL SO EARNESTLY FOR THE CONFESSION OF SIN THAT THESE BLACK WEEDS HAVE SPRUNG UP OUT OF A BURIED HEART TO MAKE MANIFEST AN OUTSPOKEN CRIME THAT GOOD SIR IS BUT A PHANTASY OF YOURS REPLIED THE MINISTER
SUCH IS FREQUENTLY THE FATE AND SUCH THE STERN DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEMININE CHARACTER AND PERSON WHEN THE WOMAN HAS ENCOUNTERED AND LIVED THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE OF PECULIAR SEVERITY
BY THE INDIAN'S SIDE AND EVIDENTLY SUSTAINING A COMPANIONSHIP WITH HIM STOOD A WHITE MAN CLAD IN A STRANGE DISARRAY OF CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE COSTUME
SMOKING TOBACCO UNDER THE BEADLE'S VERY NOSE ALTHOUGH EACH WHIFF WOULD HAVE COST A TOWNSMAN A SHILLING
NOR WOULD IT HAVE SEEMED A MIRACLE TOO HIGH TO BE WROUGHT FOR ONE SO HOLY HAD HE ASCENDED BEFORE THEIR EYES WAXING DIMMER AND BRIGHTER AND FADING AT LAST INTO THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN
THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY CHAPTER XXII
AND NOW WHAT WOULDST THOU WITH ME TOUCHING THIS MAN I MUST REVEAL THE SECRET ANSWERED HESTER FIRMLY
HIS FIRST CARE WAS GIVEN TO THE CHILD WHOSE CRIES INDEED AS SHE LAY WRITHING ON THE TRUNDLE-BED MADE IT OF PEREMPTORY NECESSITY TO POSTPONE ALL OTHER BUSINESS TO THE TASK OF SOOTHING HER
THE DISCOVERY WAS SOON MADE I IMAGINE THAT THE NEW SURVEYOR HAD NO GREAT HARM IN HIM
DRINK IT
TO THE UNTRUE MAN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IS FALSE--IT IS IMPALPABLE--IT SHRINKS TO NOTHING WITHIN HIS GRASP
THE WHOLE TOWN WILL AWAKE AND HURRY FORTH AND FIND ME HERE BUT IT WAS NOT SO
SHE POSSESSED AN ART THAT SUFFICED EVEN IN A LAND THAT AFFORDED COMPARATIVELY LITTLE SCOPE FOR ITS EXERCISE TO SUPPLY FOOD FOR HER THRIVING INFANT AND HERSELF
THE CHANGE MAY BE FOR GOOD OR ILL AND IS PARTLY PERHAPS FOR BOTH
LET HIM HIDE HIMSELF IN OUTWARD HONOUR IF HE MAY
THENCE WITH NATIVE AUDACITY BUT STILL WITH A RESERVE AS CHARACTERISTIC SHE FLEW INTO THE MIDST OF A GROUP OF MARINERS THE SWARTHY-CHEEKED WILD MEN OF THE OCEAN AS THE INDIANS WERE OF THE LAND
MY BLESSING ON MY FRIENDS
BUT MUCH TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CROWD THIS LATTER BUSINESS WAS BROKEN OFF BY THE INTERPOSITION OF THE TOWN BEADLE WHO HAD NO IDEA OF PERMITTING THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW TO BE VIOLATED BY SUCH AN ABUSE OF ONE OF ITS CONSECRATED PLACES
CONCLUSION AFTER MANY DAYS WHEN TIME SUFFICED FOR THE PEOPLE TO ARRANGE THEIR THOUGHTS IN REFERENCE TO THE FOREGOING SCENE THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAD BEEN WITNESSED ON THE SCAFFOLD
IN THEIR RESEARCHES INTO THE HUMAN FRAME IT MAY BE THAT THE HIGHER AND MORE SUBTLE FACULTIES OF SUCH MEN WERE MATERIALISED AND THAT THEY LOST THE SPIRITUAL VIEW OF EXISTENCE AMID THE INTRICACIES OF THAT WONDROUS MECHANISM WHICH SEEMED TO INVOLVE ART ENOUGH TO COMPRISE ALL OF LIFE WITHIN ITSELF
HIS FRAME WAS NOT BENT NOR DID HIS HAND REST OMINOUSLY UPON HIS HEART
I DEEM IT NOT LIKELY THAT HE WILL BETRAY THE SECRET
AND SO SHALL LITTLE PEARL
THIS LONG CONNEXION OF A FAMILY WITH ONE SPOT AS ITS PLACE OF BIRTH AND BURIAL CREATES A KINDRED BETWEEN THE HUMAN BEING AND THE LOCALITY QUITE INDEPENDENT OF ANY CHARM IN THE SCENERY OR MORAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUND HIM
EVEN IF I IMAGINE A SCHEME OF VENGEANCE WHAT COULD I DO BETTER FOR MY OBJECT THAN TO LET THEE LIVE--THAN TO GIVE THEE MEDICINES AGAINST ALL HARM AND PERIL OF LIFE--SO THAT THIS BURNING SHAME MAY STILL BLAZE UPON THY BOSOM AS HE SPOKE HE LAID HIS LONG FORE-FINGER ON THE SCARLET LETTER WHICH FORTHWITH SEEMED TO SCORCH INTO HESTER'S BREAST AS IF IT HAD BEEN RED HOT
ART THOU LIKE THE BLACK MAN THAT HAUNTS THE FOREST ROUND ABOUT US
AND THE MINISTER HEARD HER FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING FROM THE SIDE-WALK ALONG WHICH SHE HAD BEEN PASSING
THE MINISTER'S VIGIL WALKING IN THE SHADOW OF A DREAM AS IT WERE AND PERHAPS ACTUALLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SPECIES OF SOMNAMBULISM MR DIMMESDALE REACHED THE SPOT WHERE NOW SO LONG SINCE HESTER PRYNNE HAD LIVED THROUGH HER FIRST HOURS OF PUBLIC IGNOMINY
MY OLD STUDIES IN ALCHEMY OBSERVED HE AND MY SOJOURN FOR ABOVE A YEAR PAST AMONG A PEOPLE WELL VERSED IN THE KINDLY PROPERTIES OF SIMPLES HAVE MADE A BETTER PHYSICIAN OF ME THAN MANY THAT CLAIM THE MEDICAL DEGREE
WHILE THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE WHICH THE SUNLIGHT CAST UPON THE FLOOR WAS TREMULOUS WITH THE VEHEMENCE OF HIS APPEAL
THEY WERE ANCIENT SEA-CAPTAINS FOR THE MOST PART WHO AFTER BEING TOSSED ON EVERY SEA AND STANDING UP STURDILY AGAINST LIFE'S TEMPESTUOUS BLAST HAD FINALLY DRIFTED INTO THIS QUIET NOOK WHERE WITH LITTLE TO DISTURB THEM EXCEPT THE PERIODICAL TERRORS OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THEY ONE AND ALL ACQUIRED A NEW LEASE OF EXISTENCE
IF THOU FEAREST TO LEAVE ME IN OUR COTTAGE THOU MIGHTEST TAKE ME ALONG WITH THEE
BUT THE LONG HABIT OF VICTORY HAS MADE THEM GENEROUS
HASTEN PEARL OR I SHALL BE ANGRY WITH THEE CRIED HESTER PRYNNE WHO HOWEVER INURED TO SUCH BEHAVIOUR ON THE ELF-CHILD'S PART AT OTHER SEASONS WAS NATURALLY ANXIOUS FOR A MORE SEEMLY DEPORTMENT NOW
HIS NERVE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED
BUT OUT OF THE WHOLE HUMAN FAMILY IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASY TO SELECT THE SAME NUMBER OF WISE AND VIRTUOUS PERSONS WHO SHOULD BE LESS CAPABLE OF SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON AN ERRING WOMAN'S HEART AND DISENTANGLING ITS MESH OF GOOD AND EVIL THAN THE SAGES OF RIGID ASPECT TOWARDS WHOM HESTER PRYNNE NOW TURNED HER FACE
I FELT IT ALMOST AS A DESTINY TO MAKE SALEM MY HOME
IMAGINING I PRESUME THAT HER BOSOM HAS ALL THE SOFTNESS AND SNUGNESS OF AN EIDERDOWN PILLOW
IT WAS ONLY THE DARKENED HOUSE THAT COULD CONTAIN HER
IN THIS MATTER OF HESTER PRYNNE THERE WAS NEITHER IRRITATION NOR IRKSOMENESS
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT HE GATHERED HERBS AND THE BLOSSOMS OF WILD-FLOWERS AND DUG UP ROOTS AND PLUCKED OFF TWIGS FROM THE FOREST-TREES LIKE ONE ACQUAINTED WITH HIDDEN VIRTUES IN WHAT WAS VALUELESS TO COMMON EYES
IT WAS DUE IN PART TO ALL THESE CAUSES BUT STILL MORE TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO LONGER ANYTHING IN HESTER'S FACE FOR LOVE TO DWELL UPON
THE INTELLECT ANY MORE THAN A DEEP SENSE OF HUMOUR HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE MATTER
HAPPY ARE YOU HESTER THAT WEAR THE SCARLET LETTER OPENLY UPON YOUR BOSOM
BUT NOW SHOULD YOU GO THITHER TO SEEK HIM YOU WOULD INQUIRE IN VAIN FOR THE LOCOFOCO SURVEYOR
BUT THERE WAS TIME ENOUGH YET FOR LITTLE PEARL
HAD HE ONCE FOUND POWER TO SMILE AND WEAR A FACE OF GAIETY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SUCH MAN
EITHER THAT HE HAD SEEN IT ONLY IN A DREAM HITHERTO OR THAT HE WAS MERELY DREAMING ABOUT IT NOW
SHE CAME NOT AS A GUEST BUT AS A RIGHTFUL INMATE INTO THE HOUSEHOLD THAT WAS DARKENED BY TROUBLE AS IF ITS GLOOMY TWILIGHT WERE A MEDIUM IN WHICH SHE WAS ENTITLED TO HOLD INTERCOURSE WITH HER FELLOW-CREATURE
SHE IS NOT FAR OFF
AN OLD SOLDIER MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO PRIZE ONLY THE BLOODY LAUREL ON HIS BROW
LIKE ALL THAT PERTAINS TO CRIME IT SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN A YOUTHFUL ERA
A KNOWLEDGE OF MEN'S HEARTS WILL BE NEEDFUL TO THE COMPLETEST SOLUTION OF THAT PROBLEM
ALTHOUGH BY A SEEMINGLY CARELESS ARRANGEMENT OF HIS HETEROGENEOUS GARB HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL OR ABATE THE PECULIARITY IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT TO HESTER PRYNNE THAT ONE OF THIS MAN'S SHOULDERS ROSE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER
I FELT NO LOVE NOR FEIGNED ANY TRUE REPLIED HE
THIS OLD TOWN OF SALEM--MY NATIVE PLACE THOUGH I HAVE DWELT MUCH AWAY FROM IT BOTH IN BOYHOOD AND MATURER YEARS--POSSESSES OR DID POSSESS A HOLD ON MY AFFECTION THE FORCE OF WHICH I HAVE NEVER REALIZED DURING MY SEASONS OF ACTUAL RESIDENCE HERE
IT IS THE GREAT LETTER A
SHE WAS LADYLIKE TOO AFTER THE MANNER OF THE FEMININE GENTILITY OF THOSE DAYS
ONE OF THEM THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS HIS SITUATION AND ANOTHER THE VERY NATURE OF HIS BUSINESS WHICH--THOUGH I TRUST AN HONEST ONE--IS OF SUCH A SORT THAT HE DOES NOT SHARE IN THE UNITED EFFORT OF MANKIND
ONE OF THOSE UNQUESTIONABLE CRUISERS FREQUENT AT THAT DAY WHICH WITHOUT BEING ABSOLUTELY OUTLAWS OF THE DEEP YET ROAMED OVER ITS SURFACE WITH A REMARKABLE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF CHARACTER
HE TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN THE PHYSICIAN UNDER SOME OTHER NAME WHICH THE NARRATOR OF THE STORY HAD NOW FORGOTTEN IN COMPANY WITH DR FORMAN THE FAMOUS OLD CONJURER WHO WAS IMPLICATED IN THE AFFAIR OF OVERBURY
ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER IN HER LATE SINGULAR INTERVIEW WITH MR DIMMESDALE HESTER PRYNNE WAS SHOCKED AT THE CONDITION TO WHICH SHE FOUND THE CLERGYMAN REDUCED
THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
I WOULD VERY GLADLY GO
KEEPING UP THE METAPHOR OF THE POLITICAL GUILLOTINE THE WHOLE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF A DECAPITATED SURVEYOR
SO VIVID WAS THE EXPRESSION OR SO INTENSE THE MINISTER'S PERCEPTION OF IT THAT IT SEEMED STILL TO REMAIN PAINTED ON THE DARKNESS AFTER THE METEOR HAD VANISHED WITH AN EFFECT AS IF THE STREET AND ALL THINGS ELSE WERE AT ONCE ANNIHILATED
SATAN DROPPED IT THERE I TAKE IT INTENDING A SCURRILOUS JEST AGAINST YOUR REVERENCE
BUT THEN--BY A KIND OF NECESSITY THAT ALWAYS IMPELLED THIS CHILD TO ALLOY WHATEVER COMFORT SHE MIGHT CHANCE TO GIVE WITH A THROB OF ANGUISH--PEARL PUT UP HER MOUTH AND KISSED THE SCARLET LETTER TOO
A LANDSMAN COULD HARDLY HAVE WORN THIS GARB AND SHOWN THIS FACE AND WORN AND SHOWN THEM BOTH WITH SUCH A GALLIARD AIR WITHOUT UNDERGOING STERN QUESTION BEFORE A MAGISTRATE AND PROBABLY INCURRING A FINE OR IMPRISONMENT OR PERHAPS AN EXHIBITION IN THE STOCKS
WHILE THE PROCESSION PASSED THE CHILD WAS UNEASY FLUTTERING UP AND DOWN LIKE A BIRD ON THE POINT OF TAKING FLIGHT
OR WHETHER HER WILD RICH NATURE HAD BEEN SOFTENED AND SUBDUED AND MADE CAPABLE OF A WOMAN'S GENTLE HAPPINESS
NOR MUST WE KNOW HIM
WITH HIS OWN GHOSTLY VOICE HE HAD EXHORTED ME ON THE SACRED CONSIDERATION OF MY FILIAL DUTY AND REVERENCE TOWARDS HIM--WHO MIGHT REASONABLY REGARD HIMSELF AS MY OFFICIAL ANCESTOR--TO BRING HIS MOULDY AND MOTH-EATEN LUCUBRATIONS BEFORE THE PUBLIC
AS THE RANKS OF MILITARY MEN AND CIVIL FATHERS MOVED ONWARD ALL EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS THE POINT WHERE THE MINISTER WAS SEEN TO APPROACH AMONG THEM
ADVISE ME WHAT TO DO IS THE WORLD THEN SO NARROW EXCLAIMED HESTER PRYNNE FIXING HER DEEP EYES ON THE MINISTER'S AND INSTINCTIVELY EXERCISING A MAGNETIC POWER OVER A SPIRIT SO SHATTERED AND SUBDUED THAT IT COULD HARDLY HOLD ITSELF ERECT
THESE OUTBREAKS OF A FIERCE TEMPER HAD A KIND OF VALUE AND EVEN COMFORT FOR THE MOTHER
BUT THAT PERVERSITY WHICH ALL CHILDREN HAVE MORE OR LESS OF AND OF WHICH LITTLE PEARL HAD A TENFOLD PORTION NOW AT THE MOST INOPPORTUNE MOMENT TOOK THOROUGH POSSESSION OF HER AND CLOSED HER LIPS OR IMPELLED HER TO SPEAK WORDS AMISS
IT WAS MEANT FOR A BLESSING--FOR THE ONE BLESSING OF HER LIFE
SATAN THAT AFTERNOON HAD SURELY LED THE POOR YOUNG GIRL AWAY FROM HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND THROWN HER INTO THE PATHWAY OF THIS SORELY TEMPTED OR--SHALL WE NOT RATHER SAY?--THIS LOST AND DESPERATE MAN
BE IT SIN OR NO SAID HESTER PRYNNE BITTERLY AS STILL SHE GAZED AFTER HIM I HATE THE MAN SHE UPBRAIDED HERSELF FOR THE SENTIMENT BUT COULD NOT OVERCOME OR LESSEN IT
DO NOT TEASE ME
IS THE IMP ALTOGETHER EVIL
WILT THOU FORGIVE I DO FORGIVE YOU HESTER REPLIED THE MINISTER AT LENGTH WITH A DEEP UTTERANCE OUT OF AN ABYSS OF SADNESS BUT NO ANGER
THE BEARDS OF THE AGED WERE NO WHITER NOR COULD THE CREEPING BABE OF YESTERDAY WALK ON HIS FEET TO-DAY
WHILE THEY TALKED TOGETHER AND MADE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS AS WERE SUGGESTED BY THEIR NEW POSITION AND THE PURPOSES SOON TO BE FULFILLED
SOON LIKEWISE MY OLD NATIVE TOWN WILL LOOM UPON ME THROUGH THE HAZE OF MEMORY A MIST BROODING OVER AND AROUND IT
AND AS HER TEARS FELL UPON HER FATHER'S CHEEK THEY WERE THE PLEDGE THAT SHE WOULD GROW UP AMID HUMAN JOY AND SORROW NOR FOREVER DO BATTLE WITH THE WORLD BUT BE A WOMAN IN IT
BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE OLD MAN RUSHED FORWARD AND CAUGHT THE MINISTER BY THE ARM
SO SAID HESTER PRYNNE AND GLANCED HER SAD EYES DOWNWARD AT THE SCARLET LETTER
HER SPIRIT SANK WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL MUST HAVE BEEN A DELUSION AND THAT VIVIDLY AS SHE HAD DREAMED IT THERE COULD BE NO REAL BOND BETWIXT THE CLERGYMAN AND HERSELF
AND IT SHOULD BE BORNE CAREFULLY IN MIND THAT THE MAIN FACTS OF THAT STORY ARE AUTHORIZED AND AUTHENTICATED BY THE DOCUMENT OF MR SURVEYOR PUE
NEVERTHELESS SO ABSTRACTED WAS HIS LOOK IT MIGHT BE QUESTIONED WHETHER MR DIMMESDALE EVEN HEARD THE MUSIC
HE RESOLVED NOT TO BE PILLORIED BESIDE HER ON HER PEDESTAL OF SHAME
BUT I KNOW WHOSE BROW SHE HAS DOST THOU KNOW HESTER SAID ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WITH AN UNQUIET SMILE THAT THIS DEAR CHILD TRIPPING ABOUT ALWAYS AT THY SIDE HATH CAUSED ME MANY AN ALARM
LITTLE PEARL CRIED HE AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
FOR HESTER PRYNNE HAD IMMEDIATELY BECOME AS STILL AS DEATH ALTHOUGH THE CHILD CONTINUED TO MOAN
NO GOLDEN LIGHT HAD EVER BEEN SO PRECIOUS AS THE GLOOM OF THIS DARK FOREST
CHILDREN HAVE ALWAYS A SYMPATHY IN THE AGITATIONS OF THOSE CONNECTED WITH THEM
IT IS CAPABLE OF DENYING COMMON JUSTICE WHEN TOO STRENUOUSLY DEMANDED AS A RIGHT
A TRAIT OF NATIVE ELEGANCE SELDOM SEEN IN THE MASCULINE CHARACTER AFTER CHILDHOOD OR EARLY YOUTH WAS SHOWN IN THE GENERAL'S FONDNESS FOR THE SIGHT AND FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS
IT MAY BE THAT WHEN WE FORGOT OUR GOD--WHEN WE VIOLATED OUR REVERENCE EACH FOR THE OTHER'S SOUL--IT WAS THENCEFORTH VAIN TO HOPE THAT WE COULD MEET HEREAFTER IN AN EVERLASTING AND PURE REUNION
SO SHALLOW SO DELUSIVE SO IMPALPABLE SUCH AN ABSOLUTE NONENTITY IN EVERY OTHER
CONWAY LIFE OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 1891
THE MEDICINE IS POTENT FOR GOOD AND WERE IT MY CHILD--YEA MINE OWN AS WELL AS THINE
THE INTERVIEW CHAPTER V
IN SUCH EMERGENCIES HESTER'S NATURE SHOWED ITSELF WARM AND RICH--A WELL-SPRING OF HUMAN TENDERNESS UNFAILING TO EVERY REAL DEMAND AND INEXHAUSTIBLE BY THE LARGEST
THE BUCCANEER ON THE WAVE MIGHT RELINQUISH HIS CALLING AND BECOME AT ONCE IF HE CHOSE A MAN OF PROBITY AND PIETY ON LAND
ATTIRING HIMSELF WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF IT HAD BEEN FOR PUBLIC WORSHIP AND PRECISELY IN THE SAME MANNER HE STOLE SOFTLY DOWN THE STAIRCASE UNDID THE DOOR AND ISSUED FORTH
SHE MIGHT IN ONE OF HER PHASES HAVE BEEN A PROPHETESS
SHE WHO HAS ONCE BEEN A WOMAN AND CEASED TO BE SO MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BECOME A WOMAN AGAIN IF THERE WERE ONLY THE MAGIC TOUCH TO EFFECT THE TRANSFORMATION
AH
THEN AND THERE BEFORE THE JUDGMENT-SEAT THY MOTHER AND THOU AND I MUST STAND TOGETHER
IT DENOTED THE ADVANCE OF THE PROCESSION OF MAGISTRATES AND CITIZENS ON ITS WAY TOWARDS THE MEETING-HOUSE
INVOLVED IN THESE THOUGHTS SHE SCARCELY HEARD A VOICE BEHIND HER UNTIL IT HAD REPEATED HER NAME MORE THAN ONCE IN A LOUD AND SOLEMN TONE AUDIBLE TO THE WHOLE MULTITUDE
WAS THE ELECTION OF GENERAL TAYLOR TO THE PRESIDENCY
THE SCARLET LETTER WHICH EXPLAINS AS MUCH OF THIS UNIQUE IMAGINATIVE ART AS IS TO BE GATHERED FROM READING HIS HIGHEST SINGLE ACHIEVEMENT YET NEEDS TO BE RANGED WITH HIS OTHER WRITINGS EARLY AND LATE TO HAVE ITS LAST EFFECT
LITTLE PEARL AT FIRST CLAPPED HER HANDS BUT THEN LOST FOR AN INSTANT THE RESTLESS AGITATION THAT HAD KEPT HER IN A CONTINUAL EFFERVESCENCE THROUGHOUT THE MORNING
I MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE CONTENTED MYSELF WITH WRITING OUT THE NARRATIVES OF A VETERAN SHIPMASTER ONE OF THE INSPECTORS WHOM I SHOULD BE MOST UNGRATEFUL NOT TO MENTION SINCE SCARCELY A DAY PASSED THAT HE DID NOT STIR ME TO LAUGHTER AND ADMIRATION BY HIS MARVELOUS GIFTS AS A STORY-TELLER
DOLLIVER ROMANCE 1ST PART IN ATLANTIC MONTHLY 1864
HESTER AT HER NEEDLE CHAPTER VI
BUT UP TO THAT EPOCH OF MY LIFE I HAD LIVED IN VAIN
THERE ARE FEW UGLIER TRAITS OF HUMAN NATURE THAN THIS TENDENCY--WHICH I NOW WITNESSED IN MEN NO WORSE THAN THEIR NEIGHBOURS--TO GROW CRUEL MERELY BECAUSE THEY POSSESSED THE POWER OF INFLICTING HARM
NOW WHAT MORTAL IMAGINATION COULD CONCEIVE IT WHISPERED THE OLD LADY CONFIDENTIALLY TO HESTER
COULD THERE BE PLAINER SPEECH THAN THIS
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WOULD BEGIN TO ROUSE ITSELF
MY LITTLE PEARL SAID HESTER AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE THE GREEN LETTER AND ON THY CHILDISH BOSOM HAS NO PURPORT
THE LITTLE BAGGAGE HATH WITCHCRAFT IN HER I PROFESS SAID HE TO MR DIMMESDALE
UNLESS SOME PRETERNATURALLY GIFTED OBSERVER SHOULD HAVE FIRST READ THE HEART AND HAVE AFTERWARDS SOUGHT A CORRESPONDING DEVELOPMENT IN THE COUNTENANCE AND MIEN
MEANWHILE HER MOTHER HAD ACCOSTED THE PHYSICIAN
THIS CREED WAS NEVER TAUGHT FOR INSTANCE BY THE VENERABLE PASTOR JOHN WILSON WHOSE BEARD WHITE AS A SNOW-DRIFT WAS SEEN OVER GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S SHOULDERS WHILE ITS WEARER SUGGESTED THAT PEARS AND PEACHES MIGHT YET BE NATURALISED IN THE NEW ENGLAND CLIMATE AND THAT PURPLE GRAPES MIGHT POSSIBLY BE COMPELLED TO FLOURISH AGAINST THE SUNNY GARDEN-WALL
I JUDGED NO LESS SAID THE PHYSICIAN
WHAT CAN THY SILENCE DO FOR HIM EXCEPT IT TEMPT HIM--YEA COMPEL HIM AS IT WERE--TO ADD HYPOCRISY TO SIN
THE TRUTH SEEMS TO BE HOWEVER THAT WHEN HE CASTS HIS LEAVES FORTH UPON THE WIND THE AUTHOR ADDRESSES NOT THE MANY WHO WILL FLING ASIDE HIS VOLUME OR NEVER TAKE IT UP BUT THE FEW WHO WILL UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER THAN MOST OF HIS SCHOOLMATES OR LIFEMATES
AS THE SACRED EDIFICE WAS TOO MUCH THRONGED TO ADMIT ANOTHER AUDITOR SHE TOOK UP HER POSITION CLOSE BESIDE THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY
WHEREFORE SHOULD WE LINGER UPON IT NOW
HE IF IT STAND WITH HIS GOOD PLEASURE CAN CURE OR HE CAN KILL
NO
NO
NO
ON THE TRANSFER OF THE ARCHIVES TO HALIFAX THIS PACKAGE PROVING TO BE OF NO PUBLIC CONCERN WAS LEFT BEHIND AND HAD REMAINED EVER SINCE UNOPENED
NONE SO SELF-DEVOTED AS HESTER WHEN PESTILENCE STALKED THROUGH THE TOWN
PEARL LOOKING AT THIS BRIGHT WONDER OF A HOUSE BEGAN TO CAPER AND DANCE AND IMPERATIVELY REQUIRED THAT THE WHOLE BREADTH OF SUNSHINE SHOULD BE STRIPPED OFF ITS FRONT AND GIVEN HER TO PLAY WITH
THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN AFTER A FEW HOURS OF PRIVACY WAS SENSIBLE THAT THE DISORDER OF HIS NERVES HAD HURRIED HIM INTO AN UNSEEMLY OUTBREAK OF TEMPER WHICH THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING IN THE PHYSICIAN'S WORDS TO EXCUSE OR PALLIATE
HIS VOICE AND LAUGH WHICH PERPETUALLY RE-ECHOED THROUGH THE CUSTOM-HOUSE HAD NOTHING OF THE TREMULOUS QUAVER AND CACKLE OF AN OLD MAN'S UTTERANCE
THEN TOUCHING THE SHOULDER OF A TOWNSMAN WHO STOOD NEAR TO HIM HE ADDRESSED HIM IN A FORMAL AND COURTEOUS MANNER
THE LIFE OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE LIES LIKE A DREAM BEHIND ME
WEEKS IT IS TRUE WOULD SOMETIMES ELAPSE DURING WHICH PEARL'S GAZE MIGHT NEVER ONCE BE FIXED UPON THE SCARLET LETTER
SHE LOVES ME AND WILL LOVE THEE THOU CANST NOT THINK SAID THE MINISTER GLANCING ASIDE AT HESTER PRYNNE HOW MY HEART DREADS THIS INTERVIEW AND YEARNS FOR IT
MY OLD FAITH LONG FORGOTTEN COMES BACK TO ME AND EXPLAINS ALL THAT WE DO AND ALL WE SUFFER
DO I FEEL JOY AGAIN CRIED HE WONDERING AT HIMSELF
HE WOULD HAVE RELEASED HIMSELF BUT STROVE IN VAIN TO DO SO
AND OVER HER GRAVE THE INFAMY THAT SHE MUST CARRY THITHER WOULD BE HER ONLY MONUMENT
THE MARKET-PLACE THE GRASS-PLOT BEFORE THE JAIL IN PRISON LANE ON A CERTAIN SUMMER MORNING NOT LESS THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO WAS OCCUPIED BY A PRETTY LARGE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF BOSTON ALL WITH THEIR EYES INTENTLY FASTENED ON THE IRON-CLAMPED OAKEN DOOR
WOULD THOU HAVE ME TO BELIEVE O WISE AND PIOUS FRIEND THAT A FALSE SHOW CAN BE BETTER--CAN BE MORE FOR GOD'S GLORY OR MAN WELFARE--THAN GOD'S OWN TRUTH
A BLESSING ON THE RIGHTEOUS COLONY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS WHERE INIQUITY IS DRAGGED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE
IN HESTER PRYNNE'S INSTANCE HOWEVER AS NOT UNFREQUENTLY IN OTHER CASES HER SENTENCE BORE THAT SHE SHOULD STAND A CERTAIN TIME UPON THE PLATFORM BUT WITHOUT UNDERGOING THAT GRIPE ABOUT THE NECK AND CONFINEMENT OF THE HEAD THE PRONENESS TO WHICH WAS THE MOST DEVILISH CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS UGLY ENGINE
PRITHEE FRIEND LEAVE ME ALONE WITH MY PATIENT SAID THE PRACTITIONER
PEARL I SEE THE CHILD OBSERVED THE MINISTER
THE MID-OCEAN SHALL TAKE IT FROM MY HAND AND SWALLOW IT UP FOR EVER WITH THESE WORDS SHE ADVANCED TO THE MARGIN OF THE BROOK TOOK UP THE SCARLET LETTER AND FASTENED IT AGAIN INTO HER BOSOM
HIST HIST SAID SHE WHILE HER ILL-OMENED PHYSIOGNOMY SEEMED TO CAST A SHADOW OVER THE CHEERFUL NEWNESS OF THE HOUSE
IT WAS CERTAINLY A DOUBTFUL CHARM IMPARTING A HARD METALLIC LUSTRE TO THE CHILD'S CHARACTER
A WOMAN NEVER OVERCOMES THESE PROBLEMS BY ANY EXERCISE OF THOUGHT
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEE WHAT I AM--A FIEND
WHAT DOES THIS SAD LITTLE BROOK SAY MOTHER INQUIRED SHE
AND MAY SHE FEEL TOO--WHAT METHINKS IS THE VERY TRUTH--THAT THIS BOON WAS MEANT ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE TO KEEP THE MOTHER'S SOUL ALIVE AND TO PRESERVE HER FROM BLACKER DEPTHS OF SIN INTO WHICH SATAN MIGHT ELSE HAVE SOUGHT TO PLUNGE HER
SHE CONQUERED HER FEARS AND SPOKE
ALL OTHER SCENES OF EARTH--EVEN THAT VILLAGE OF RURAL ENGLAND WHERE HAPPY INFANCY AND STAINLESS MAIDENHOOD SEEMED YET TO BE IN HER MOTHER'S KEEPING LIKE GARMENTS PUT OFF LONG AGO--WERE FOREIGN TO HER IN COMPARISON
I HAVE A STRANGE FANCY OBSERVED THE SENSITIVE MINISTER THAT THIS BROOK IS THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN TWO WORLDS AND THAT THOU CANST NEVER MEET THY PEARL AGAIN
SO THE MOTHER AND LITTLE PEARL WERE ADMITTED INTO THE HALL OF ENTRANCE
I MUST BEAR ITS TORTURE YET A LITTLE LONGER--ONLY A FEW DAYS LONGER--UNTIL WE SHALL HAVE LEFT THIS REGION AND LOOK BACK HITHER AS TO A LAND WHICH WE HAVE DREAMED OF
IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS A FRIENDLY BOUT AT QUARTERSTAFF
THE GLIMMER OF THIS LUMINARY SUGGESTED THE ABOVE CONCEITS TO MR DIMMESDALE WHO SMILED--NAY ALMOST LAUGHED AT THEM--AND THEN WONDERED IF HE WAS GOING MAD
BELIEVE ME HESTER THERE ARE FEW THINGS WHETHER IN THE OUTWARD WORLD OR TO A CERTAIN DEPTH IN THE INVISIBLE SPHERE OF THOUGHT--FEW THINGS HIDDEN FROM THE MAN WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF EARNESTLY AND UNRESERVEDLY TO THE SOLUTION OF A MYSTERY
STILL CAME THE BATTERY OF FLOWERS ALMOST INVARIABLY HITTING THE MARK AND COVERING THE MOTHER'S BREAST WITH HURTS FOR WHICH SHE COULD FIND NO BALM IN THIS WORLD NOR KNEW HOW TO SEEK IT IN ANOTHER
SHE FLED FOR REFUGE AS IT WERE TO THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE AND DREADED THE MOMENT WHEN ITS PROTECTION SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM HER
THESE FATHERS OTHERWISE SO APOSTOLIC LACKED HEAVEN'S LAST AND RAREST ATTESTATION OF THEIR OFFICE THE TONGUE OF FLAME
BUT THE FROWN OF THIS PALE WEAK SINFUL AND SORROW-STRICKEN MAN WAS WHAT HESTER COULD NOT BEAR AND LIVE
AND IN THE DEEP FOREST WHERE ONLY THE OLD TREES CAN HEAR AND THE STRIP OF SKY SEE IT HE TALKS WITH THEE SITTING ON A HEAP OF MOSS
COME ALONG MADAME HESTER AND SHOW YOUR SCARLET LETTER IN THE MARKET-PLACE A LANE WAS FORTHWITH OPENED THROUGH THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS
PHILOSOPHICALLY CONSIDERED THEREFORE THE TWO PASSIONS SEEM ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EXCEPT THAT ONE HAPPENS TO BE SEEN IN A CELESTIAL RADIANCE AND THE OTHER IN A DUSKY AND LURID GLOW
WHAT CHOICE REMAINS TO ME
THEY SAY CHILD THOU ART OF THE LINEAGE OF THE PRINCE OF AIR
HE WAS BORN AT SALEM MASS ON JULY 4TH 1804 SON OF A SEA-CAPTAIN
THIS WRETCHED AND WRONGED OLD MAN IS OPPOSING IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT!--WITH ALL HIS OWN MIGHT AND THE FIEND'S
SHE HAD CLIMBED HER WAY SINCE THEN TO A HIGHER POINT
AND YET THOUGH INVARIABLY HAPPIEST ELSEWHERE THERE IS WITHIN ME A FEELING FOR OLD SALEM WHICH IN LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE I MUST BE CONTENT TO CALL AFFECTION
AND IT HAS GROWN UPON HIM BY THE HIDDEN PRACTICES OF HIS REVENGE
AND AM NOW BROUGHT HITHER BY THIS INDIAN TO BE REDEEMED OUT OF MY CAPTIVITY
THERE IS TRUTH IN WHAT SHE SAYS BEGAN THE MINISTER WITH A VOICE SWEET TREMULOUS BUT POWERFUL INSOMUCH THAT THE HALL RE-ECHOED AND THE HOLLOW ARMOUR RANG WITH IT--"TRUTH IN WHAT HESTER SAYS AND IN THE FEELING WHICH INSPIRES HER
HE HATH GOT HOLD OF THE MINISTER ALREADY
IT WAS SORROWFUL TO THINK HOW MANY DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS OF TOIL HAD BEEN WASTED ON THESE MUSTY PAPERS WHICH WERE NOW ONLY AN ENCUMBRANCE ON EARTH AND WERE HIDDEN AWAY IN THIS FORGOTTEN CORNER NEVER MORE TO BE GLANCED AT BY HUMAN EYES
BUT HERE--IF WE SUPPOSE THIS INTERVIEW BETWIXT MISTRESS HIBBINS AND HESTER PRYNNE TO BE AUTHENTIC AND NOT A PARABLE--WAS ALREADY AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER'S ARGUMENT AGAINST SUNDERING THE RELATION OF A FALLEN MOTHER TO THE OFFSPRING OF HER FRAILTY
AND DOES HE NOW SUMMON ME TO ITS FULFILMENT BY SUGGESTING THE PERFORMANCE OF EVERY WICKEDNESS WHICH HIS MOST FOUL IMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE THUS COMMUNED WITH HIMSELF AND STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD WITH HIS HAND OLD MISTRESS HIBBINS THE REPUTED WITCH-LADY IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN PASSING BY
FOR HESTER HIS SPIRIT LACKED THE STRENGTH THAT COULD HAVE BORNE UP AS THINE HAS BENEATH A BURDEN LIKE THY SCARLET LETTER
MR DIMMESDALE
THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THIS WORLD THAT A CHILD MUST NOT ASK ABOUT
LET ME NOW DO THE WILL WHICH HE HATH MADE PLAIN BEFORE MY SIGHT
THE FUTURE IS YET FULL OF TRIAL AND SUCCESS
THOU CANST LEAP LIKE A YOUNG DEER PEARL WITHOUT RESPONDING IN ANY MANNER TO THESE HONEY-SWEET EXPRESSIONS REMAINED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BROOK
HURRYING ALONG THE STREET THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE ENCOUNTERED THE ELDEST FEMALE MEMBER OF HIS CHURCH A MOST PIOUS AND EXEMPLARY OLD DAME POOR WIDOWED LONELY AND WITH A HEART AS FULL OF REMINISCENCES ABOUT HER DEAD HUSBAND AND CHILDREN AND HER DEAD FRIENDS OF LONG AGO AS A BURIAL-GROUND IS FULL OF STORIED GRAVESTONES
THEY WERE HER COUNTRYWOMEN
IT HAD THE GRAVEYARD ORIGINALLY ISAAC JOHNSON'S HOME-FIELD ON ONE SIDE AND SO WAS WELL ADAPTED TO CALL UP SERIOUS REFLECTIONS SUITED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYMENTS IN BOTH MINISTER AND MAN OF PHYSIC
THE TOWN DID NOT AWAKE
NO MORE SMILE WITH THE HOUSEHOLD JOY NOR MOURN WITH THE KINDRED SORROW
THE EARLIEST RISER COMING FORTH IN THE DIM TWILIGHT WOULD PERCEIVE A VAGUELY-DEFINED FIGURE ALOFT ON THE PLACE OF SHAME
PREACH
THIS I NOW OPENED AND HAD THE SATISFACTION TO FIND RECORDED BY THE OLD SURVEYOR'S PEN A REASONABLY COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR
GHOSTS MIGHT ENTER HERE WITHOUT AFFRIGHTING US
HE ENTERED THE ACCUSTOMED ROOM AND LOOKED AROUND HIM ON ITS BOOKS ITS WINDOWS ITS FIREPLACE AND THE TAPESTRIED COMFORT OF THE WALLS WITH THE SAME PERCEPTION OF STRANGENESS THAT HAD HAUNTED HIM THROUGHOUT HIS WALK FROM THE FOREST DELL INTO THE TOWN AND THITHERWARD
NEXT IN ORDER TO THE MAGISTRATES CAME THE YOUNG AND EMINENTLY DISTINGUISHED DIVINE FROM WHOSE LIPS THE RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OF THE ANNIVERSARY WAS EXPECTED
CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE JAILER INTO THE DISMAL APARTMENT APPEARED THAT INDIVIDUAL OF SINGULAR ASPECT WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE CROWD HAD BEEN OF SUCH DEEP INTEREST TO THE WEARER OF THE SCARLET LETTER
IT IS A PIOUS CONSOLATION TO ME THAT THROUGH MY INTERFERENCE A SUFFICIENT SPACE WAS ALLOWED THEM FOR REPENTANCE OF THE EVIL AND CORRUPT PRACTICES INTO WHICH AS A MATTER OF COURSE EVERY CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER MUST BE SUPPOSED TO FALL
AND IT GLOWS LIKE A RED FLAME IN THE DARK
I WENT NOT INTO THE FOREST TO SEEK A POTENTATE NEITHER DO I AT ANY FUTURE TIME DESIGN A VISIT THITHER WITH A VIEW TO GAINING THE FAVOUR OF SUCH PERSONAGE
THE HEAT THAT HAD FORMERLY PERVADED HIS NATURE AND WHICH WAS NOT YET EXTINCT WAS NEVER OF THE KIND THAT FLASHES AND FLICKERS IN A BLAZE
THE MINISTER IN A MAZE CHAPTER XXI
THERE WAS MOREOVER A BOLDNESS AND ROTUNDITY OF SPEECH AMONG THESE MATRONS AS MOST OF THEM SEEMED TO BE THAT WOULD STARTLE US AT THE PRESENT DAY WHETHER IN RESPECT TO ITS PURPORT OR ITS VOLUME OF TONE
LOOKING INSTINCTIVELY FROM THE OPEN WINDOW--FOR IT WAS SUMMER-TIME--THE MINISTER BEHELD HESTER PRYNNE AND LITTLE PEARL PASSING ALONG THE FOOTPATH THAT TRAVERSED THE ENCLOSURE
BUT IN THAT EARLY SEVERITY OF THE PURITAN CHARACTER AN INFERENCE OF THIS KIND COULD NOT SO INDUBITABLY BE DRAWN
HIS WAS THE PROFESSION AT THAT ERA IN WHICH INTELLECTUAL ABILITY DISPLAYED ITSELF FAR MORE THAN IN POLITICAL LIFE
AND SINCE MR DIMMESDALE HAD TAKEN HER IN CHARGE THE GOOD GRANDAM'S CHIEF EARTHLY COMFORT--WHICH UNLESS IT HAD BEEN LIKEWISE A HEAVENLY COMFORT COULD HAVE BEEN NONE AT ALL--WAS TO MEET HER PASTOR WHETHER CASUALLY OR OF SET PURPOSE AND BE REFRESHED WITH A WORD OF WARM FRAGRANT HEAVEN-BREATHING GOSPEL TRUTH FROM HIS BELOVED LIPS INTO HER DULLED BUT RAPTUROUSLY ATTENTIVE EAR
LET US DIG A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS VEIN THEN AFTER LONG SEARCH INTO THE MINISTER'S DIM INTERIOR AND TURNING OVER MANY PRECIOUS MATERIALS IN THE SHAPE OF HIGH ASPIRATIONS FOR THE WELFARE OF HIS RACE WARM LOVE OF SOULS PURE SENTIMENTS NATURAL PIETY STRENGTHENED BY THOUGHT AND STUDY AND ILLUMINATED BY REVELATION--ALL OF WHICH INVALUABLE GOLD WAS PERHAPS NO BETTER THAN RUBBISH TO THE SEEKER--HE WOULD TURN BACK DISCOURAGED AND BEGIN HIS QUEST TOWARDS ANOTHER POINT
SUCH AN INTERVIEW PERHAPS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVEN TO MEET HIM AS SHE NOW DID WITH THE HOT MID-DAY SUN BURNING DOWN UPON HER FACE AND LIGHTING UP ITS SHAME
THIS INSPECTOR WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM WAS A MAN OF FOURSCORE YEARS OR THEREABOUTS AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL SPECIMENS OF WINTER-GREEN THAT YOU WOULD BE LIKELY TO DISCOVER IN A LIFETIME'S SEARCH
THEY ARE NOT TO BE SOLVED OR ONLY IN ONE WAY
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS--WHICH SOMETIMES OCCUR ONLY AT THE INTERVAL OF YEARS--WHEN A MAN'S MORAL ASPECT IS FAITHFULLY REVEALED TO HIS MIND'S EYE
HE TOOK HIMSELF TO TASK FOR HIS BAD SYMPATHIES IN REFERENCE TO ROGER CHILLINGWORTH DISREGARDED THE LESSON THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DRAWN FROM THEM AND DID HIS BEST TO ROOT THEM OUT
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MADE AFRESH OUT OF NEW ELEMENTS AND MUST PERFORCE BE PERMITTED TO LIVE HER OWN LIFE AND BE A LAW UNTO HERSELF WITHOUT HER ECCENTRICITIES BEING RECKONED TO HER FOR A CRIME
SHE HATH RAISED A GREAT SCANDAL I PROMISE YOU IN GODLY MASTER DIMMESDALE'S CHURCH YOU SAY TRULY REPLIED THE OTHER
EACH IN ITS UTMOST DEVELOPMENT SUPPOSES A HIGH DEGREE OF INTIMACY AND HEART-KNOWLEDGE
THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE PROFOUND AS WHAT SHOULD FOLLOW THE UTTERANCE OF ORACLES
THE VOICE WHICH HAD CALLED HER ATTENTION WAS THAT OF THE REVEREND AND FAMOUS JOHN WILSON THE ELDEST CLERGYMAN OF BOSTON A GREAT SCHOLAR LIKE MOST OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THE PROFESSION AND WITHAL A MAN OF KIND AND GENIAL SPIRIT
WE HAVE YET TO LEARN AGAIN THE FORGOTTEN ART OF GAIETY
IT SUMMONED HIM ONWARD--INWARD TO THE FESTIVAL!--BUT HERE HE MADE A PAUSE
THIS WARMER LIGHT MINGLES ITSELF WITH THE COLD SPIRITUALITY OF THE MOON-BEAMS AND COMMUNICATES AS IT WERE A HEART AND SENSIBILITIES OF HUMAN TENDERNESS TO THE FORMS WHICH FANCY SUMMONS UP
BUT THE PAST WAS NOT DEAD
SEEN IN THE BROOK ONCE MORE WAS THE SHADOWY WRATH OF PEARL'S IMAGE CROWNED AND GIRDLED WITH FLOWERS BUT STAMPING ITS FOOT WILDLY GESTICULATING AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL STILL POINTING ITS SMALL FOREFINGER AT HESTER'S BOSOM
IT MIGHT BE THAT AN ANTINOMIAN A QUAKER OR OTHER HETERODOX RELIGIONIST WAS TO BE SCOURGED OUT OF THE TOWN OR AN IDLE OR VAGRANT INDIAN WHOM THE WHITE MAN'S FIREWATER HAD MADE RIOTOUS ABOUT THE STREETS WAS TO BE DRIVEN WITH STRIPES INTO THE SHADOW OF THE FOREST
GLANCING AT THE LOOKING-GLASS WE BEHOLD--DEEP WITHIN ITS HAUNTED VERGE--THE SMOULDERING GLOW OF THE HALF-EXTINGUISHED ANTHRACITE THE WHITE MOON-BEAMS ON THE FLOOR AND A REPETITION OF ALL THE GLEAM AND SHADOW OF THE PICTURE WITH ONE REMOVE FURTHER FROM THE ACTUAL AND NEARER TO THE IMAGINATIVE
SAVE WHEN THY GOOD--THY LIFE--THY FAME--WERE PUT IN QUESTION
WHAT HAS THE LETTER TO DO WITH ANY HEART SAVE MINE NAY MOTHER I HAVE TOLD ALL I KNOW SAID PEARL MORE SERIOUSLY THAN SHE WAS WONT TO SPEAK
NOT A STITCH IN THAT EMBROIDERED LETTER BUT SHE HAS FELT IT IN HER HEART THE GRIM BEADLE NOW MADE A GESTURE WITH HIS STAFF
BY BRINGING ME HITHER TO DIE THIS DEATH OF TRIUMPHANT IGNOMINY BEFORE THE PEOPLE
TO JUDGE FROM THE GLOOM AND TERROR IN THE DEPTH OF THE POOR MINISTER'S EYES THE BATTLE WAS A SORE ONE AND THE VICTORY ANYTHING BUT SECURE
THAT IS BUT A TRIFLE WHEN A WOMAN KNOWS THE WORLD
ON THAT SPOT IN VERY TRUTH THERE WAS AND THERE HAD LONG BEEN THE GNAWING AND POISONOUS TOOTH OF BODILY PAIN
AS HER MOTHER STILL KEPT BECKONING TO HER AND ARRAYING HER FACE IN A HOLIDAY SUIT OF UNACCUSTOMED SMILES THE CHILD STAMPED HER FOOT WITH A YET MORE IMPERIOUS LOOK AND GESTURE
PEARL'S INEVITABLE TENDENCY TO HOVER ABOUT THE ENIGMA OF THE SCARLET LETTER SEEMED AN INNATE QUALITY OF HER BEING
HE THREW OFF ALL ASSISTANCE AND STEPPED PASSIONATELY FORWARD A PACE BEFORE THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN
HESTER HAD SCHOOLED HERSELF LONG AND WELL
IT WOULD BE SINFUL IN SUCH A QUESTION TO FOLLOW THE CLUE OF PROFANE PHILOSOPHY SAID MR WILSON
WAS IT BUT THE MOCKERY OF PENITENCE
THEY AVERRED THAT THE SYMBOL WAS NOT MERE SCARLET CLOTH TINGED IN AN EARTHLY DYE-POT BUT WAS RED-HOT WITH INFERNAL FIRE AND COULD BE SEEN GLOWING ALL ALIGHT WHENEVER HESTER PRYNNE WALKED ABROAD IN THE NIGHT-TIME
AND YET THE MEN OF CIVIL EMINENCE WHO CAME IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE MILITARY ESCORT WERE BETTER WORTH A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER'S EYE
THE MULTITUDE SILENT TILL THEN BROKE OUT IN A STRANGE DEEP VOICE OF AWE AND WONDER WHICH COULD NOT AS YET FIND UTTERANCE SAVE IN THIS MURMUR THAT ROLLED SO HEAVILY AFTER THE DEPARTED SPIRIT
THE IMPRESSION MADE BY HIS ASPECT SO RIGID AND SEVERE AND FROST-BITTEN WITH MORE THAN AUTUMNAL AGE WAS HARDLY IN KEEPING WITH THE APPLIANCES OF WORLDLY ENJOYMENT WHEREWITH HE HAD EVIDENTLY DONE HIS UTMOST TO SURROUND HIMSELF
THEN GASPING FOR BREATH DID HESTER PRYNNE CLUTCH THE FATAL TOKEN INSTINCTIVELY ENDEAVOURING TO TEAR IT AWAY SO INFINITE WAS THE TORTURE INFLICTED BY THE INTELLIGENT TOUCH OF PEARL'S BABY-HAND
WE DOUBT WHETHER ANY MARKED EVENT FOR GOOD OR EVIL EVER BEFELL NEW ENGLAND FROM ITS SETTLEMENT DOWN TO REVOLUTIONARY TIMES OF WHICH THE INHABITANTS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY WARNED BY SOME SPECTACLE OF ITS NATURE
IT WAS MOREOVER A SEPARATE AND INSULATED EVENT TO OCCUR BUT ONCE IN HER LIFETIME AND TO MEET WHICH THEREFORE RECKLESS OF ECONOMY SHE MIGHT CALL UP THE VITAL STRENGTH THAT WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR MANY QUIET YEARS
THERE WAS NO FEEBLENESS OF STEP AS AT OTHER TIMES
BUT A LIE IS NEVER GOOD EVEN THOUGH DEATH THREATEN ON THE OTHER SIDE
SO POWERFUL SEEMED THE MINISTER'S APPEAL THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BELIEVE BUT THAT HESTER PRYNNE WOULD SPEAK OUT THE GUILTY NAME OR ELSE THAT THE GUILTY ONE HIMSELF IN WHATEVER HIGH OR LOWLY PLACE HE STOOD WOULD BE DRAWN FORTH BY AN INWARD AND INEVITABLE NECESSITY AND COMPELLED TO ASCEND THE SCAFFOLD
BUT THE VISIONARY LITTLE MAID ON HER PART BECKONED LIKEWISE AS IF TO SAY--"THIS IS A BETTER PLACE
THE HOBBY-HORSE--WHATEVER IN A WORD HAS BEEN USED OR PLAYED WITH DURING THE DAY IS NOW INVESTED WITH A QUALITY OF STRANGENESS AND REMOTENESS THOUGH STILL ALMOST AS VIVIDLY PRESENT AS BY DAYLIGHT
THAT IT WAS HUMAN TO AVOID THE PERIL OF DEATH AND INFAMY AND THE INSCRUTABLE MACHINATIONS OF AN ENEMY
THOU ART STRONG
TOWARDS HER MOTHER TOO PEARL'S ERRAND AS A MESSENGER OF ANGUISH WAS FULFILLED
HIS GRAY BEARD ALMOST TOUCHED THE GROUND AS HE CREPT ONWARD
DO THIS AND THE PROFIT SHALL BE ALL YOUR OWN
NOTHING IN SHORT BUT A FEW COMMONPLACE INSTINCTS WHICH AIDED BY THE CHEERFUL TEMPER WHICH GREW INEVITABLY OUT OF HIS PHYSICAL WELL-BEING DID DUTY VERY RESPECTABLY AND TO GENERAL ACCEPTANCE IN LIEU OF A HEART
THY STRENGTH HESTER
THE PRISON-DOOR CHAPTER II
HUMAN NATURE WILL NOT FLOURISH ANY MORE THAN A POTATO IF IT BE PLANTED AND RE-PLANTED FOR TOO LONG A SERIES OF GENERATIONS IN THE SAME WORN-OUT SOIL
AND HER POSITION ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD IT WELL AND WAS IN LITTLE DANGER OF FORGETTING IT WAS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE HER VIVID SELF-PERCEPTION LIKE A NEW ANGUISH BY THE RUDEST TOUCH UPON THE TENDEREST SPOT
XIX
AND AS HE DREW TOWARDS THE CLOSE A SPIRIT AS OF PROPHECY HAD COME UPON HIM CONSTRAINING HIM TO ITS PURPOSE AS MIGHTILY AS THE OLD PROPHETS OF ISRAEL WERE CONSTRAINED ONLY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHEREAS THE JEWISH SEERS HAD DENOUNCED JUDGMENTS AND RUIN ON THEIR COUNTRY IT WAS HIS MISSION TO FORETELL A HIGH AND GLORIOUS DESTINY FOR THE NEWLY GATHERED PEOPLE OF THE LORD
THE ELDERS THE DEACONS THE MOTHERLY DAMES AND THE YOUNG AND FAIR MAIDENS OF MR DIMMESDALE'S FLOCK WERE ALIKE IMPORTUNATE THAT HE SHOULD MAKE TRIAL OF THE PHYSICIAN'S FRANKLY OFFERED SKILL
HESTER COULD NOT BUT ASK HERSELF WHETHER THERE HAD NOT ORIGINALLY BEEN A DEFECT OF TRUTH COURAGE AND LOYALTY ON HER OWN PART IN ALLOWING THE MINISTER TO BE THROWN INTO A POSITION WHERE SO MUCH EVIL WAS TO BE FOREBODED AND NOTHING AUSPICIOUS TO BE HOPED
AND OF A TRUTH MOREOVER THERE IS THE LIKENESS OF THE SCARLET LETTER RUNNING ALONG BY HER SIDE
BUT I CHARGE YOU IN THIS MATTER OF OLD MISTRESS PRYNNE GIVE TO YOUR PREDECESSOR'S MEMORY THE CREDIT WHICH WILL BE RIGHTFULLY DUE AND I SAID TO THE GHOST OF MR SURVEYOR PUE--"I WILL ON HESTER PRYNNE'S STORY THEREFORE I BESTOWED MUCH THOUGHT
HOW MAY THIS BE UNLESS YOU FIRST LAY OPEN TO HIM THE WOUND OR TROUBLE IN YOUR SOUL NO NOT TO THEE
THE ORIGINAL PAPERS TOGETHER WITH THE SCARLET LETTER ITSELF--A MOST CURIOUS RELIC--ARE STILL IN MY POSSESSION AND SHALL BE FREELY EXHIBITED TO WHOMSOEVER INDUCED BY THE GREAT INTEREST OF THE NARRATIVE MAY DESIRE A SIGHT OF THEM
MY HOME IS WHERE THOU ART AND WHERE HE IS
XVIII
AND SO HE DID
AND THE MELANCHOLY BROOK WOULD ADD THIS OTHER TALE TO THE MYSTERY WITH WHICH ITS LITTLE HEART WAS ALREADY OVERBURDENED AND WHEREOF IT STILL KEPT UP A MURMURING BABBLE WITH NOT A WHIT MORE CHEERFULNESS OF TONE THAN FOR AGES HERETOFORE
BUT SHE HAS NO GREAT TENDERNESS EVEN IN HER BEST OF MOODS AND SOONER OR LATER--OFTENER SOON THAN LATE--IS APT TO FLING OFF HER NESTLINGS WITH A SCRATCH OF HER CLAW A DAB OF HER BEAK OR A RANKLING WOUND FROM HER BARBED ARROWS
SHE RESEMBLED IN HER FIERCE PURSUIT OF THEM AN INFANT PESTILENCE--THE SCARLET FEVER OR SOME SUCH HALF-FLEDGED ANGEL OF JUDGMENT--WHOSE MISSION WAS TO PUNISH THE SINS OF THE RISING GENERATION
THE FEELING THAT IT SO EVIDENTLY MANIFESTED RATHER THAN THE DIRECT PURPORT OF THE WORDS CAUSED IT TO VIBRATE WITHIN ALL HEARTS AND BROUGHT THE LISTENERS INTO ONE ACCORD OF SYMPATHY
I KNOW NOT WHETHER THESE ANCESTORS OF MINE BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES TO REPENT AND ASK PARDON OF HEAVEN FOR THEIR CRUELTIES
MADAME HESTER ABSOLUTELY REFUSETH TO SPEAK AND THE MAGISTRATES HAVE LAID THEIR HEADS TOGETHER IN VAIN
BUT HE FOUGHT BACK THE BODILY WEAKNESS--AND STILL MORE THE FAINTNESS OF HEART--THAT WAS STRIVING FOR THE MASTERY WITH HIM
HER MATRONLY FAME WAS TRODDEN UNDER ALL MEN'S FEET
BUT THROUGHOUT IT ALL AND THROUGH THE WHOLE DISCOURSE THERE HAD BEEN A CERTAIN DEEP SAD UNDERTONE OF PATHOS WHICH COULD NOT BE INTERPRETED OTHERWISE THAN AS THE NATURAL REGRET OF ONE SOON TO PASS AWAY
WILT THOU YET PURGE IT OUT OF THEE AND BE ONCE MORE HUMAN
VANITY IT MAY BE CHOSE TO MORTIFY ITSELF BY PUTTING ON FOR CEREMONIALS OF POMP AND STATE THE GARMENTS THAT HAD BEEN WROUGHT BY HER SINFUL HANDS
THE SAME PLATFORM OR SCAFFOLD BLACK AND WEATHER-STAINED WITH THE STORM OR SUNSHINE OF SEVEN LONG YEARS AND FOOT-WORN TOO WITH THE TREAD OF MANY CULPRITS WHO HAD SINCE ASCENDED IT REMAINED STANDING BENEATH THE BALCONY OF THE MEETING-HOUSE
THE HEART MAKING ITSELF GUILTY OF SUCH SECRETS MUST PERFORCE HOLD THEM UNTIL THE DAY WHEN ALL HIDDEN THINGS SHALL BE REVEALED
IT HAD BEEN BUILT BY AN EARLIER SETTLER AND ABANDONED BECAUSE THE SOIL ABOUT IT WAS TOO STERILE FOR CULTIVATION WHILE ITS COMPARATIVE REMOTENESS PUT IT OUT OF THE SPHERE OF THAT SOCIAL ACTIVITY WHICH ALREADY MARKED THE HABITS OF THE EMIGRANTS
THE SOMEWHAT DIM COAL FIRE HAS AN ESSENTIAL INFLUENCE IN PRODUCING THE EFFECT WHICH I WOULD DESCRIBE
WHEN THOU HAST SHOWN ME A LITTLE LOVE THOU MOCKEST ME WHY DOTH THE MINISTER SIT YONDER ASKED PEARL
HAD THEY FOLLOWED THEIR HEREDITARY TASTE THE NEW ENGLAND SETTLERS WOULD HAVE ILLUSTRATED ALL EVENTS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE BY BONFIRES BANQUETS PAGEANTRIES AND PROCESSIONS
IN OUR NATURE HOWEVER THERE IS A PROVISION ALIKE MARVELLOUS AND MERCIFUL THAT THE SUFFERER SHOULD NEVER KNOW THE INTENSITY OF WHAT HE ENDURES BY ITS PRESENT TORTURE BUT CHIEFLY BY THE PANG THAT RANKLES AFTER IT
I HAVE NO SUCH POWER AS THOU TELLEST ME OF
A PANG A STING AN EVER-RECURRING AGONY IN THE MIDST OF A TROUBLED JOY
AND NEITHER WITH THE MEN NOR THEIR AFFAIRS DID THE GENERAL APPEAR TO SUSTAIN THE MOST DISTANT RELATION
LEAVING THIS DISCUSSION APART WE HAVE A MATTER OF BUSINESS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE READER
NOT SUCH AS A MODERN MAN OF SCIENCE WOULD RECKON EVEN TOLERABLY COMPLETE BUT PROVIDED WITH A DISTILLING APPARATUS AND THE MEANS OF COMPOUNDING DRUGS AND CHEMICALS WHICH THE PRACTISED ALCHEMIST KNEW WELL HOW TO TURN TO PURPOSE
NO SUCCESS OF MINE--IF MY LIFE BEYOND ITS DOMESTIC SCOPE HAD EVER BEEN BRIGHTENED BY SUCCESS--WOULD THEY DEEM OTHERWISE THAN WORTHLESS IF NOT POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL
HAST THOU SHE ASKED
IN ANSWER TO THIS QUERY A RUMOUR GAINED GROUND--AND HOWEVER ABSURD WAS ENTERTAINED BY SOME VERY SENSIBLE PEOPLE--THAT HEAVEN HAD WROUGHT AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE BY TRANSPORTING AN EMINENT DOCTOR OF PHYSIC FROM A GERMAN UNIVERSITY BODILY THROUGH THE AIR AND SETTING HIM DOWN AT THE DOOR OF MR DIMMESDALE'S STUDY
BABY-LINEN--FOR BABIES THEN WORE ROBES OF STATE--AFFORDED STILL ANOTHER POSSIBILITY OF TOIL AND EMOLUMENT
BUT IT IS AN ERROR TO SUPPOSE THAT OUR GREAT FOREFATHERS--THOUGH ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK AND THINK OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AS A STATE MERELY OF TRIAL AND WARFARE AND THOUGH UNFEIGNEDLY PREPARED TO SACRIFICE GOODS AND LIFE AT THE BEHEST OF DUTY--MADE IT A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE TO REJECT SUCH MEANS OF COMFORT OR EVEN LUXURY AS LAY FAIRLY WITHIN THEIR GRASP
VERILY THE WOMAN HATH BEEN LIKE A POSSESSED ONE
HOW SLOW THOU ART
THE BESOM OF REFORM HATH SWEPT HIM OUT OF OFFICE AND A WORTHIER SUCCESSOR WEARS HIS DIGNITY AND POCKETS HIS EMOLUMENTS
LET THE BLACK FLOWER BLOSSOM AS IT MAY
WITH HIS FLORID CHEEK HIS COMPACT FIGURE SMARTLY ARRAYED IN A BRIGHT-BUTTONED BLUE COAT HIS BRISK AND VIGOROUS STEP AND HIS HALE AND HEARTY ASPECT ALTOGETHER HE SEEMED--NOT YOUNG INDEED--BUT A KIND OF NEW CONTRIVANCE OF MOTHER NATURE IN THE SHAPE OF MAN WHOM AGE AND INFIRMITY HAD NO BUSINESS TO TOUCH
OFTENEST PERSUASIVE BUT SOMETIMES TERRIBLE
MONCURE D
BE NOT SILENT FROM ANY MISTAKEN PITY AND TENDERNESS FOR HIM
AS A PRIEST THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS ORDER INEVITABLY HEMMED HIM IN
BUT FOR MYSELF DURING THE WHOLE OF MY CUSTOM-HOUSE EXPERIENCE MOONLIGHT AND SUNSHINE AND THE GLOW OF FIRELIGHT WERE JUST ALIKE IN MY REGARD
BUT THOUGH THERE WAS THAT SINGULAR EXPRESSION WHICH SHE HAD SO OFTEN REMARKED IN HER BLACK EYES SHE COULD NOT SATISFY HERSELF WHETHER PEARL REALLY ATTACHED ANY MEANING TO THE SYMBOL
HOW IS IT HESTER
EVEN HAD THERE BEEN A DISPOSITION TO TURN THE MATTER INTO RIDICULE IT MUST HAVE BEEN REPRESSED AND OVERPOWERED BY THE SOLEMN PRESENCE OF MEN NO LESS DIGNIFIED THAN THE GOVERNOR AND SEVERAL OF HIS COUNSELLORS A JUDGE A GENERAL AND THE MINISTERS OF THE TOWN ALL OF WHOM SAT OR STOOD IN A BALCONY OF THE MEETING-HOUSE LOOKING DOWN UPON THE PLATFORM
THERE GLIMMERED THE EMBROIDERED LETTER WITH COMFORT IN ITS UNEARTHLY RAY
SHE REMEMBERED--BETWIXT A SMILE AND A SHUDDER--THE TALK OF THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNSPEOPLE WHO SEEKING VAINLY ELSEWHERE FOR THE CHILD'S PATERNITY AND OBSERVING SOME OF HER ODD ATTRIBUTES HAD GIVEN OUT THAT POOR LITTLE PEARL WAS A DEMON OFFSPRING
IT SEEMED TO ME--THE READER MAY SMILE BUT MUST NOT DOUBT MY WORD--IT SEEMED TO ME THEN THAT I EXPERIENCED A SENSATION NOT ALTOGETHER PHYSICAL YET ALMOST SO AS OF BURNING HEAT AND AS IF THE LETTER WERE NOT OF RED CLOTH BUT RED-HOT IRON
BUT IN GOOD EARNEST NOW MOTHER DEAR WHAT DOES THIS SCARLET LETTER MEAN?--AND WHY DOST THOU WEAR IT ON THY BOSOM?--AND WHY DOES THE MINISTER KEEP HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART SHE TOOK HER MOTHER'S HAND IN BOTH HER OWN AND GAZED INTO HER EYES WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT WAS SELDOM SEEN IN HER WILD AND CAPRICIOUS CHARACTER
MOTHER SAID SHE WHAT DOES THE SCARLET LETTER MEAN AND THE NEXT MORNING THE FIRST INDICATION THE CHILD GAVE OF BEING AWAKE WAS BY POPPING UP HER HEAD FROM THE PILLOW AND MAKING THAT OTHER ENQUIRY WHICH SHE HAD SO UNACCOUNTABLY CONNECTED WITH HER INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THE SCARLET LETTER MOTHER!--MOTHER!--WHY DOES THE MINISTER KEEP HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART HOLD THY TONGUE NAUGHTY CHILD ANSWERED HER MOTHER WITH AN ASPERITY THAT SHE HAD NEVER PERMITTED TO HERSELF BEFORE
TO HESTER PRYNNE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MODE OF EXPRESSING AND THEREFORE SOOTHING THE PASSION OF HER LIFE
OR THE ELIXIR OF LIFE FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY 1872
THE PHYSICIAN ADVANCED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIS PATIENT LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS BOSOM AND THRUST ASIDE THE VESTMENT THAT HITHERTO HAD ALWAYS COVERED IT EVEN FROM THE PROFESSIONAL EYE
WITH ALL THESE STERLING ATTRIBUTES THOUGHT HESTER THE EVIL WHICH SHE INHERITED FROM HER MOTHER MUST BE GREAT INDEED IF A NOBLE WOMAN DO NOT GROW OUT OF THIS ELFISH CHILD
YE HAVE ALL SHUDDERED AT IT
SHE BEHELD THE MINISTER ADVANCING ALONG THE PATH ENTIRELY ALONE AND LEANING ON A STAFF WHICH HE HAD CUT BY THE WAYSIDE
AS A MAN WHO HAD ONCE SINNED BUT WHO KEPT HIS CONSCIENCE ALL ALIVE AND PAINFULLY SENSITIVE BY THE FRETTING OF AN UNHEALED WOUND HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED SAFER WITHIN THE LINE OF VIRTUE THAN IF HE HAD NEVER SINNED AT ALL
AND WHEN BY ITS COMPLETEST TRIUMPH CONSUMMATION THAT EVIL PRINCIPLE WAS LEFT WITH NO FURTHER MATERIAL TO SUPPORT IT--WHEN IN SHORT THERE WAS NO MORE DEVIL'S WORK ON EARTH FOR HIM TO DO IT ONLY REMAINED FOR THE UNHUMANISED MORTAL TO BETAKE HIMSELF WHITHER HIS MASTER WOULD FIND HIM TASKS ENOUGH AND PAY HIM HIS WAGES DULY
BUT THEN AGAIN IT WOULD COME AT UNAWARES LIKE THE STROKE OF SUDDEN DEATH AND ALWAYS WITH THAT PECULIAR SMILE AND ODD EXPRESSION OF THE EYES
THE GREAT BLACK FOREST--STERN AS IT SHOWED ITSELF TO THOSE WHO BROUGHT THE GUILT AND TROUBLES OF THE WORLD INTO ITS BOSOM--BECAME THE PLAYMATE OF THE LONELY INFANT AS WELL AS IT KNEW HOW
I DOUBT GREATLY--OR RATHER I DO NOT DOUBT AT ALL--WHETHER ANY PUBLIC FUNCTIONARY OF THE UNITED STATES EITHER IN THE CIVIL OR MILITARY LINE HAS EVER HAD SUCH A PATRIARCHAL BODY OF VETERANS UNDER HIS ORDERS AS MYSELF
IT WAS MARKED WITH THE NOBLE AND HEROIC QUALITIES WHICH SHOWED IT TO BE NOT A MERE ACCIDENT BUT OF GOOD RIGHT THAT HE HAD WON A DISTINGUISHED NAME
TEMPTED BY A DREAM OF HAPPINESS HE HAD YIELDED HIMSELF WITH DELIBERATE CHOICE AS HE HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE TO WHAT HE KNEW WAS DEADLY SIN
ON THIS PUBLIC HOLIDAY AS ON ALL OTHER OCCASIONS FOR SEVEN YEARS PAST HESTER WAS CLAD IN A GARMENT OF COARSE GRAY CLOTH
IN SUCH A CASE IT COULD ONLY BE THE SYMPTOM OF A HIGHLY DISORDERED MENTAL STATE WHEN A MAN RENDERED MORBIDLY SELF-CONTEMPLATIVE BY LONG INTENSE AND SECRET PAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS EGOTISM OVER THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF NATURE UNTIL THE FIRMAMENT ITSELF SHOULD APPEAR NO MORE THAN A FITTING PAGE FOR HIS SOUL'S HISTORY AND FATE
TALES OF THE WHITE HILLS LEGENDS OF NEW ENGLAND LEGENDS OF THE PROVINCE HOUSE 1877 CONTAIN TALES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRINTED IN BOOK FORM IN TWICE-TOLD TALES AND THE MOSSES SKETCHED AND STUDIES 1883
WOULD HE NOT SUDDENLY SINK INTO THE EARTH LEAVING A BARREN AND BLASTED SPOT WHERE IN DUE COURSE OF TIME WOULD BE SEEN DEADLY NIGHTSHADE DOGWOOD HENBANE AND WHATEVER ELSE OF VEGETABLE WICKEDNESS THE CLIMATE COULD PRODUCE ALL FLOURISHING WITH HIDEOUS LUXURIANCE
SOULS IT IS SAID MORE SOULS THAN ONE WERE BROUGHT TO THE TRUTH BY THE EFFICACY OF THAT SERMON AND VOWED WITHIN THEMSELVES TO CHERISH A HOLY GRATITUDE TOWARDS MR DIMMESDALE THROUGHOUT THE LONG HEREAFTER
THEREBY SO FAR DISPELLING THE CUSTOMARY CLOUD THAT FOR THE SPACE OF A SINGLE HOLIDAY THEY APPEARED SCARCELY MORE GRAVE THAN MOST OTHER COMMUNITIES AT A PERIOD OF GENERAL AFFLICTION
IT MAY BE TRUE THAT TO A SENSITIVE OBSERVER THERE WAS SOME THING EXQUISITELY PAINFUL IN IT
AND HER FACE AS SHE GLANCED UPWARD AT THE MINISTER WORE THAT NAUGHTY SMILE WHICH MADE ITS EXPRESSION FREQUENTLY SO ELVISH
HERE WAS A FINE PROSPECT IN THE DISTANCE
NO NOT THINE V
ACCORDING TO THEIR UNITED TESTIMONY NEVER HAD MAN SPOKEN IN SO WISE SO HIGH AND SO HOLY A SPIRIT AS HE THAT SPAKE THIS DAY
BUT NOW IT IS ALL FALSEHOOD!--ALL EMPTINESS!--ALL DEATH HESTER PRYNNE LOOKED INTO HIS FACE BUT HESITATED TO SPEAK
HE FELT HIS LIMBS GROWING STIFF WITH THE UNACCUSTOMED CHILLINESS OF THE NIGHT AND DOUBTED WHETHER HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DESCEND THE STEPS OF THE SCAFFOLD
AFTER PARTING FROM THE PHYSICIAN THE COMMANDER OF THE BRISTOL SHIP STROLLED IDLY THROUGH THE MARKET-PLACE
DEATH WAS TOO DEFINITE AN OBJECT TO BE WISHED FOR OR AVOIDED
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS THAT THIS BRIGHT AND SUNNY APPARITION OWED ITS EXISTENCE TO THE SHAPE OF GLOOMY GRAY
THERE WERE TRIFLES TOO LITTLE ORNAMENTS BEAUTIFUL TOKENS OF A CONTINUAL REMEMBRANCE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WROUGHT BY DELICATE FINGERS AT THE IMPULSE OF A FOND HEART
AND NOW ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE AS WERE THE LATTER STEPS OF HIS PROGRESS HE HAD COME OPPOSITE THE WELL-REMEMBERED AND WEATHER-DARKENED SCAFFOLD WHERE LONG SINCE WITH ALL THAT DREARY LAPSE OF TIME BETWEEN HESTER PRYNNE HAD ENCOUNTERED THE WORLD'S IGNOMINIOUS STARE
WILT THOU COME ACROSS THE BROOK AND OWN THY MOTHER NOW THAT SHE HAS HER SHAME UPON HER--NOW THAT SHE IS SAD YES
FORTH PEEPED AT HER OUT OF THE POOL WITH DARK GLISTENING CURLS AROUND HER HEAD AND AN ELF-SMILE IN HER EYES THE IMAGE OF A LITTLE MAID WHOM PEARL HAVING NO OTHER PLAYMATE INVITED TO TAKE HER HAND AND RUN A RACE WITH HER
NONE KNEW--NOR EVER LEARNED WITH THE FULNESS OF PERFECT CERTAINTY--WHETHER THE ELF-CHILD HAD GONE THUS UNTIMELY TO A MAIDEN GRAVE
AS A FIRST STEP THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY IS TO BE TORN DOWN AND BUILT UP ANEW
HATH SHE AFFECTIONS
SO THE CHILD FLEW AWAY LIKE A BIRD AND MAKING BARE HER SMALL WHITE FEET WENT PATTERING ALONG THE MOIST MARGIN OF THE SEA
THE MOMENT THAT HE DID SO THERE CAME WHAT SEEMED A TUMULTUOUS RUSH OF NEW LIFE OTHER LIFE THAN HIS OWN POURING LIKE A TORRENT INTO HIS HEART AND HURRYING THROUGH ALL HIS VEINS AS IF THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD WERE COMMUNICATING THEIR VITAL WARMTH TO HIS HALF-TORPID SYSTEM
ON MY LIFE HESTER I MADE MY INTREATY TO THE WORSHIPFUL MAGISTRATE THAT IT MIGHT BE DONE FORTHWITH IT LIES NOT IN THE PLEASURE OF THE MAGISTRATES TO TAKE OFF THE BADGE CALMLY REPLIED HESTER
THE EJECTED OFFICER--FORTUNATE IN THE UNKINDLY SHOVE THAT SENDS HIM FORTH BETIMES TO STRUGGLE AMID A STRUGGLING WORLD--MAY RETURN TO HIMSELF AND BECOME ALL THAT HE HAS EVER BEEN
THE BLITHEDALE ROMANCE 1852
THY POWER IS NOT WHAT IT WAS
THOU KNOWEST--FOR THOU HAST SYMPATHIES WHICH THESE MEN LACK--THOU KNOWEST WHAT IS IN MY HEART AND WHAT ARE A MOTHER'S RIGHTS AND HOW MUCH THE STRONGER THEY ARE WHEN THAT MOTHER HAS BUT HER CHILD AND THE SCARLET LETTER
LOOK HESTER LOOKED BY WAY OF HUMOURING THE CHILD
AND HIS YOUNG WIFE LOOK YOU BEING LEFT TO HER OWN MISGUIDANCE AH!--AHA!--I CONCEIVE YOU SAID THE STRANGER WITH A BITTER SMILE
HE NOW DREW BACK WITH A LONG RESPIRATION
A KIND OF INTIMACY AS WE HAVE SAID GREW UP BETWEEN THESE TWO CULTIVATED MINDS WHICH HAD AS WIDE A FIELD AS THE WHOLE SPHERE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND STUDY TO MEET UPON
IF THE MINISTER'S VOICE HAD NOT KEPT HER THERE THERE WOULD NEVERTHELESS HAVE BEEN AN INEVITABLE MAGNETISM IN THAT SPOT WHENCE SHE DATED THE FIRST HOUR OF HER LIFE OF IGNOMINY
THIS PHANTASY WAS PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY THE NEAR PROXIMITY OF THE GOVERNOR'S RED ROSES AS PEARL STOOD OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW TOGETHER WITH HER RECOLLECTION OF THE PRISON ROSE-BUSH WHICH SHE HAD PASSED IN COMING HITHER
IT COMPRISED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS PERHAPS IMPERFECTLY ADAPTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND PLAYED WITH NO GREAT SKILL
IT WAS REVEALED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS RULE IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSUMED THAT THE FOREFATHERS OF BOSTON HAD BUILT THE FIRST PRISON-HOUSE SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY OF CORNHILL ALMOST AS SEASONABLY AS THEY MARKED OUT THE FIRST BURIAL-GROUND ON ISAAC JOHNSON'S LOT AND ROUND ABOUT HIS GRAVE WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME THE NUCLEUS OF ALL THE CONGREGATED SEPULCHRES IN THE OLD CHURCHYARD OF KING'S CHAPEL
HATRED BY A GRADUAL AND QUIET PROCESS WILL EVEN BE TRANSFORMED TO LOVE UNLESS THE CHANGE BE IMPEDED BY A CONTINUALLY NEW IRRITATION OF THE ORIGINAL FEELING OF HOSTILITY
OR IF NOT THOU STRANGE AND ELFISH CHILD WHENCE DIDST THOU COME TELL ME
BUT UNLIKE THE LITTLE STREAM SHE DANCED AND SPARKLED AND PRATTLED AIRILY ALONG HER COURSE
YET THOSE SAME BLEARED OPTICS HAD A STRANGE PENETRATING POWER WHEN IT WAS THEIR OWNER'S PURPOSE TO READ THE HUMAN SOUL
THIS WAS A LARGE WOODEN HOUSE BUILT IN A FASHION OF WHICH THERE ARE SPECIMENS STILL EXTANT IN THE STREETS OF OUR OLDER TOWNS NOW MOSS-GROWN CRUMBLING TO DECAY AND MELANCHOLY AT HEART WITH THE MANY SORROWFUL OR JOYFUL OCCURRENCES REMEMBERED OR FORGOTTEN THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND PASSED AWAY WITHIN THEIR DUSKY CHAMBERS
WHILE IN ITS SWIFTER AND LIVELIER PASSAGES THERE APPEARED A CHANNEL-WAY OF PEBBLES AND BROWN SPARKLING SAND
PERHAPS SEEN DOUBTFULLY AND BY A FAINT LIGHT OF THEIR OWN IN THE REMOTE DIMNESS OF THE CHAMBER OR MORE VIVIDLY AND CLOSE BESIDE HIM WITHIN THE LOOKING-GLASS
HE GATHERED HERE AND THERE A HERB OR GRUBBED UP A ROOT AND PUT IT INTO THE BASKET ON HIS ARM
HE LACKED ENERGY TO GRASP THE BETTER FORTUNE THAT SEEMED WITHIN HIS REACH
HE HAS FELT AN INFLUENCE DWELLING ALWAYS UPON HIM LIKE A CURSE
I SHALL SEE HIM TREMBLE
THE LETTER IS GAILY EMBROIDERED AND SHOWS RIGHT BRAVELY ON YOUR BOSOM ALL THIS WHILE HESTER HAD BEEN LOOKING STEADILY AT THE OLD MAN AND WAS SHOCKED AS WELL AS WONDER-SMITTEN TO DISCERN WHAT A CHANGE HAD BEEN WROUGHT UPON HIM WITHIN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS
IN MY CONTEMPLATION HE STOOD AS THE IDEAL OF HIS CLASS
IT WAS I NOT LESS THAN HE
BUT METHINKS DEAR SIR YOU LOOK PALE AS IF THE TRAVEL THROUGH THE WILDERNESS HAD BEEN TOO SORE FOR YOU
AND BENEATH IN THE MIRROR OF THE BROOK THERE WAS THE FLOWER-GIRDLED AND SUNNY IMAGE OF LITTLE PEARL POINTING HER SMALL FOREFINGER TOO
IT MAY BE THAT MY REMEDIES SO LONG ADMINISTERED IN VAIN BEGIN NOW TO TAKE DUE EFFECT
THEY TRANSGRESSED WITHOUT FEAR OR SCRUPLE THE RULES OF BEHAVIOUR THAT WERE BINDING ON ALL OTHERS
THE PAVEMENT ROUND ABOUT THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED EDIFICE--WHICH WE MAY AS WELL NAME AT ONCE AS THE CUSTOM-HOUSE OF THE PORT--HAS GRASS ENOUGH GROWING IN ITS CHINKS TO SHOW THAT IT HAS NOT OF LATE DAYS BEEN WORN BY ANY MULTITUDINOUS RESORT OF BUSINESS
AND YET MAJESTIC AS THE VOICE SOMETIMES BECAME THERE WAS FOR EVER IN IT AN ESSENTIAL CHARACTER OF PLAINTIVENESS
THE MINISTER WENT UP THE STEPS
BUT THAT WAS IN THE OLD LAND
I SHUDDERED AND INVOLUNTARILY LET IT FALL UPON THE FLOOR
ONCE MORE THEREFORE THE TRAIN OF VENERABLE AND MAJESTIC FATHERS WERE SEEN MOVING THROUGH A BROAD PATHWAY OF THE PEOPLE WHO DREW BACK REVERENTLY ON EITHER SIDE AS THE GOVERNOR AND MAGISTRATES THE OLD AND WISE MEN THE HOLY MINISTERS AND ALL THAT WERE EMINENT AND RENOWNED ADVANCED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
EACH LEAVES THE PASSIONATE LOVER OR THE NO LESS PASSIONATE HATER FORLORN AND DESOLATE BY THE WITHDRAWAL OF HIS SUBJECT
BUT TRULY FORSOOTH I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE HIM THE SAME MAN
THIS PURPOSE ONCE EFFECTED NEW INTERESTS WOULD IMMEDIATELY SPRING UP AND LIKEWISE A NEW PURPOSE
THE CHILD'S OWN NATURE HAD SOMETHING WRONG IN IT WHICH CONTINUALLY BETOKENED THAT SHE HAD BEEN BORN AMISS--THE EFFLUENCE OF HER MOTHER'S LAWLESS PASSION--AND OFTEN IMPELLED HESTER TO ASK IN BITTERNESS OF HEART WHETHER IT WERE FOR ILL OR GOOD THAT THE POOR LITTLE CREATURE HAD BEEN BORN AT ALL
THE MINISTER STOOD WHITE AND SPEECHLESS WITH ONE HAND ON THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES AND THE OTHER SPREAD UPON HIS BREAST
THERE WERE SEVERAL FOOLSCAP SHEETS CONTAINING MANY PARTICULARS RESPECTING THE LIFE AND CONVERSATION OF ONE HESTER PRYNNE WHO APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN RATHER A NOTEWORTHY PERSONAGE IN THE VIEW OF OUR ANCESTORS
IS THE WORSHIPFUL GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITHIN INQUIRED HESTER
THE BOY ALSO IN DUE TIME PASSED FROM THE FORECASTLE TO THE CABIN SPENT A TEMPESTUOUS MANHOOD AND RETURNED FROM HIS WORLD-WANDERINGS TO GROW OLD AND DIE AND MINGLE HIS DUST WITH THE NATAL EARTH
ANOTHER PECULIAR TORTURE WAS FELT IN THE GAZE OF A NEW EYE
MR WILSON
WILT THOU NOT FROWN
IN THE ARRAY OF FUNERALS TOO--WHETHER FOR THE APPAREL OF THE DEAD BODY OR TO TYPIFY BY MANIFOLD EMBLEMATIC DEVICES OF SABLE CLOTH AND SNOWY LAWN THE SORROW OF THE SURVIVORS--THERE WAS A FREQUENT AND CHARACTERISTIC DEMAND FOR SUCH LABOUR AS HESTER PRYNNE COULD SUPPLY
HERE SEEN ONLY BY HIS EYES THE SCARLET LETTER NEED NOT BURN INTO THE BOSOM OF THE FALLEN WOMAN
JUST THEN SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S VOICE AND FLITTING ALONG AS LIGHTLY AS ONE OF THE LITTLE SEA-BIRDS APPEARED BEFORE HESTER PRYNNE DANCING LAUGHING AND POINTING HER FINGER TO THE ORNAMENT UPON HER BOSOM
AT ALL EVENTS I THE PRESENT WRITER AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY TAKE SHAME UPON MYSELF FOR THEIR SAKES AND PRAY THAT ANY CURSE INCURRED BY THEM--AS I HAVE HEARD AND AS THE DREARY AND UNPROSPEROUS CONDITION OF THE RACE FOR MANY A LONG YEAR BACK WOULD ARGUE TO EXIST--MAY BE NOW AND HENCEFORTH REMOVED
THERE IS GOOD TO BE DONE
AND HESTER PRYNNE WITH THE EMBROIDERED LETTER GLIMMERING ON HER BOSOM
THE WHOLE TRIBE OF DECOROUS PERSONAGES WHO HAD NEVER HERETOFORE BEEN SEEN WITH A SINGLE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS AWRY WOULD START INTO PUBLIC VIEW WITH THE DISORDER OF A NIGHTMARE IN THEIR ASPECTS
WHEN THEY REACHED THE MARKET-PLACE SHE BECAME STILL MORE RESTLESS ON PERCEIVING THE STIR AND BUSTLE THAT ENLIVENED THE SPOT
THE BUSTLE OF HIS COMMERCIAL AND CUSTOM-HOUSE LIFE KEPT UP ITS LITTLE MURMUR ROUND ABOUT HIM
HAVE YOU ANOTHER PASSENGER WHY KNOW YOU NOT CRIED THE SHIPMASTER THAT THIS PHYSICIAN HERE--CHILLINGWORTH HE CALLS HIMSELF--IS MINDED TO TRY MY CABIN-FARE WITH YOU
NEVER KNOW HIM
NOW A GROUP OF SHINING ANGELS WHO FLEW UPWARD HEAVILY AS SORROW-LADEN BUT GREW MORE ETHEREAL AS THEY ROSE
THOUGH BY NO MEANS LESS LIABLE THAN THEIR FELLOW-MEN TO AGE AND INFIRMITY THEY HAD EVIDENTLY SOME TALISMAN OR OTHER THAT KEPT DEATH AT BAY
AND WE MUST NEEDS SAY IT SEARED HESTER'S BOSOM SO DEEPLY THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS MORE TRUTH IN THE RUMOUR THAN OUR MODERN INCREDULITY MAY BE INCLINED TO ADMIT
ALL SAVE ONE THE YOUNGEST AND ONLY COMPASSIONATE AMONG THEM WHOSE BURIAL-ROBE SHE HAD SINCE MADE
WHAT EVIL HAVE I DONE THE MAN ASKED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AGAIN
NONE OF THEM I PRESUME HAD EVER READ A PAGE OF MY INDITING OR WOULD HAVE CARED A FIG THE MORE FOR ME IF THEY HAD READ THEM ALL
IN THE ABSORBING CONTEMPLATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER I HAD HITHERTO NEGLECTED TO EXAMINE A SMALL ROLL OF DINGY PAPER AROUND WHICH IT HAD BEEN TWISTED
BUT WHERE IS THIS MOTHER OF THINE
WE MUST NOT ALWAYS TALK IN THE MARKETPLACE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO US IN THE FOREST I COULD NOT BE SURE THAT IT WAS HE--SO STRANGE HE LOOKED CONTINUED THE CHILD
A CARESS SO TENDER AND WITHAL SO UNOBTRUSIVE THAT HER MOTHER WHO WAS LOOKING ON ASKED HERSELF--"IS THAT MY PEARL YET SHE KNEW THAT THERE WAS LOVE IN THE CHILD'S HEART ALTHOUGH IT MOSTLY REVEALED ITSELF IN PASSION AND HARDLY TWICE IN HER LIFETIME HAD BEEN SOFTENED BY SUCH GENTLENESS AS NOW
IT HAS OFTEN BEEN A MATTER OF REGRET WITH ME
THEN THE VERY NATURE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX OR ITS LONG HEREDITARY HABIT WHICH HAS BECOME LIKE NATURE IS TO BE ESSENTIALLY MODIFIED BEFORE WOMAN CAN BE ALLOWED TO ASSUME WHAT SEEMS A FAIR AND SUITABLE POSITION
NO JUGGLER WITH HIS TRICKS OF MIMIC WITCHCRAFT
SHE HAD AN UNDULATING BUT OFTENTIMES A SHARP AND IRREGULAR MOVEMENT
WHITHER LEADS YONDER FOREST-TRACK
MOONLIGHT IN A FAMILIAR ROOM FALLING SO WHITE UPON THE CARPET AND SHOWING ALL ITS FIGURES SO DISTINCTLY--MAKING EVERY OBJECT SO MINUTELY VISIBLE YET SO UNLIKE A MORNING OR NOONTIDE VISIBILITY--IS A MEDIUM THE MOST SUITABLE FOR A ROMANCE-WRITER TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HIS ILLUSIVE GUESTS
LOOK TO IT AT THIS WILD AND SINGULAR APPEAL WHICH INDICATED THAT HESTER PRYNNE'S SITUATION HAD PROVOKED HER TO LITTLE LESS THAN MADNESS THE YOUNG MINISTER AT ONCE CAME FORWARD PALE AND HOLDING HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART AS WAS HIS CUSTOM WHENEVER HIS PECULIARLY NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT WAS THROWN INTO AGITATION
OR--BUT THIS MORE RARELY HAPPENED--SHE WOULD BE CONVULSED WITH RAGE OF GRIEF AND SOB OUT HER LOVE FOR HER MOTHER IN BROKEN WORDS AND SEEM INTENT ON PROVING THAT SHE HAD A HEART BY BREAKING IT
BUT IN TRUTH AS I ALREADY TOLD THEE CHILDREN ARE NOT READILY WON TO BE FAMILIAR WITH ME
ON SOME SUCH MORNING WHEN THREE OR FOUR VESSELS HAPPEN TO HAVE ARRIVED AT ONCE USUALLY FROM AFRICA OR SOUTH AMERICA--OR TO BE ON THE VERGE OF THEIR DEPARTURE THITHERWARD THERE IS A SOUND OF FREQUENT FEET PASSING BRISKLY UP AND DOWN THE GRANITE STEPS
HESTER SAID HE I ASK NOT WHEREFORE NOR HOW THOU HAST FALLEN INTO THE PIT OR SAY RATHER THOU HAST ASCENDED TO THE PEDESTAL OF INFAMY ON WHICH I FOUND THEE
O THOU TO WHOM I DARE NOT LIFT MINE EYES WILT THOU YET PARDON ME THOU WILT GO SAID HESTER CALMLY AS HE MET HER GLANCE
IT IS OUR FATE
SHE THEN REMAINED APART SILENTLY WATCHING HESTER AND THE CLERGYMAN
LET ME TELL THEE IN THINE EAR
YE SHALL NOT TAKE HER
DURING ALL THIS TIME HESTER STOOD STATUE-LIKE AT THE FOOT OF THE SCAFFOLD
AS RECOGNISING THAT IN SPITE OF HIS STRICT WATCH OVER HER HEART SOME NEW EVIL HAD CREPT INTO IT OR SOME OLD ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EXPELLED
SHE FELT A MORBID DESIRE TO ASCERTAIN THE POINT
THIS HEMMED IT IN SO NARROWLY AND STOOD SO BLACK AND DENSE ON EITHER SIDE AND DISCLOSED SUCH IMPERFECT GLIMPSES OF THE SKY ABOVE THAT TO HESTER'S MIND IT IMAGED NOT AMISS THE MORAL WILDERNESS IN WHICH SHE HAD SO LONG BEEN WANDERING
ONE OF THESE SEAFARING MEN THE SHIPMASTER INDEED WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HESTER PRYNNE WAS SO SMITTEN WITH PEARL'S ASPECT THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO LAY HANDS UPON HER WITH PURPOSE TO SNATCH A KISS
THOU HAST SEEN HER--YES I KNOW IT!--BUT THOU WILT SEE HER NOW WITH OTHER EYES
MAN HAD MARKED THIS WOMAN'S SIN BY A SCARLET LETTER WHICH HAD SUCH POTENT AND DISASTROUS EFFICACY THAT NO HUMAN SYMPATHY COULD REACH HER SAVE IT WERE SINFUL LIKE HERSELF
ALTHOUGH IN A SINGLE INSTANCE HE HAD SO FEARFULLY TRANSGRESSED ONE OF THE MOST SACRED OF THEM
I--A MAN OF THOUGHT--THE BOOK-WORM OF GREAT LIBRARIES--A MAN ALREADY IN DECAY HAVING GIVEN MY BEST YEARS TO FEED THE HUNGRY DREAM OF KNOWLEDGE--WHAT HAD I TO DO WITH YOUTH AND BEAUTY LIKE THINE OWN
THE PEOPLE LOOK FOR GREAT THINGS FROM YOU APPREHENDING THAT ANOTHER YEAR MAY COME ABOUT AND FIND THEIR PASTOR GONE YES TO ANOTHER WORLD REPLIED THE MINISTER WITH PIOUS RESIGNATION
THERE WAS NO OTHER ATTRIBUTE THAT SO MUCH IMPRESSED HER WITH A SENSE OF NEW AND UNTRANSMITTED VIGOUR IN PEARL'S NATURE AS THIS NEVER FAILING VIVACITY OF SPIRITS
THOU ART NOT MY CHILD
PEARL HAD NOT FOUND THE HOUR PASS WEARISOMELY WHILE HER MOTHER SAT TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN
IN ALL THOSE YEARS IT HAD NEVER ONCE BEEN OPENED
HERE BORNE A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGONIES
BUT HERE WAS ONE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE A YOUNG GIRL'S APPRECIATION OF THE FLORAL TRIBE
THIS BRIGHT PANOPLY WAS NOT MEANT FOR MERE IDLE SHOW BUT HAD BEEN WORN BY THE GOVERNOR ON MANY A SOLEMN MUSTER AND TRAINING FIELD AND HAD GLITTERED MOREOVER AT THE HEAD OF A REGIMENT IN THE PEQUOD WAR
AT LENGTH ASSUMING A SINGULAR AIR OF AUTHORITY PEARL STRETCHED OUT HER HAND WITH THE SMALL FOREFINGER EXTENDED AND POINTING EVIDENTLY TOWARDS HER MOTHER'S BREAST
A CHILD'S SHOE
WHEN THE DREARY CHANGE WAS WROUGHT SHE EXTENDED HER HAND TO PEARL
AND I CONCEIVE MOREOVER THAT THE HEARTS HOLDING SUCH MISERABLE SECRETS AS YOU SPEAK OF WILL YIELD THEM UP AT THAT LAST DAY NOT WITH RELUCTANCE BUT WITH A JOY UNUTTERABLE THEN WHY NOT REVEAL IT HERE ASKED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH GLANCING QUIETLY ASIDE AT THE MINISTER
BUT AGAIN
METHINKS GENTLEMEN WE NEED INQUIRE NO FURTHER HESTER CAUGHT HOLD OF PEARL AND DREW HER FORCIBLY INTO HER ARMS CONFRONTING THE OLD PURITAN MAGISTRATE WITH ALMOST A FIERCE EXPRESSION
THE WORLD WAS HOSTILE
OVERHEAD WAS A GRAY EXPANSE OF CLOUD SLIGHTLY STIRRED HOWEVER BY A BREEZE
IN A MOMENT HOWEVER WISELY JUDGING THAT ONE TOKEN OF HER SHAME WOULD BUT POORLY SERVE TO HIDE ANOTHER SHE TOOK THE BABY ON HER ARM AND WITH A BURNING BLUSH AND YET A HAUGHTY SMILE AND A GLANCE THAT WOULD NOT BE ABASHED LOOKED AROUND AT HER TOWNSPEOPLE AND NEIGHBOURS
THEY SPOKE WITH FAR MORE INTEREST AND UNCTION OF THEIR MORNING'S BREAKFAST OR YESTERDAY'S TO-DAY'S OR TOMORROW'S DINNER THAN OF THE SHIPWRECK OF FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS AGO AND ALL THE WORLD'S WONDERS WHICH THEY HAD WITNESSED WITH THEIR YOUTHFUL EYES
YES IT SEEMS TO BE MY GLOVE INDEED AND SINCE SATAN SAW FIT TO STEAL IT YOUR REVERENCE MUST NEEDS HANDLE HIM WITHOUT GLOVES HENCEFORWARD REMARKED THE OLD SEXTON GRIMLY SMILING
AND MAKING AN INVESTMENT IN INK PAPER AND STEEL PENS HAD OPENED HIS LONG-DISUSED WRITING DESK AND WAS AGAIN A LITERARY MAN
MOSSES FROM AN OLD MANSE 1846
IN PART THEREFORE THE ATTACHMENT WHICH I SPEAK OF IS THE MERE SENSUOUS SYMPATHY OF DUST FOR DUST
SHE GAZED SILENTLY AND SEEMED TO BE BORNE UPWARD LIKE A FLOATING SEA-BIRD ON THE LONG HEAVES AND SWELLS OF SOUND
IT HAD EVEN THROWN ITS GLEAM IN THE SUFFERER'S BARD EXTREMITY ACROSS THE VERGE OF TIME
IT IS TOO DEEPLY BRANDED
EVEN THE POOR BABY AT HESTER'S BOSOM WAS AFFECTED BY THE SAME INFLUENCE FOR IT DIRECTED ITS HITHERTO VACANT GAZE TOWARDS MR DIMMESDALE AND HELD UP ITS LITTLE ARMS WITH A HALF-PLEASED HALF-PLAINTIVE MURMUR
AFTER TALKING WITH THOREAU ABOUT PINE-TREES AND INDIAN RELICS IN HIS HERMITAGE AT WALDEN
AND OF BENEVOLENCE WHICH FIERCELY AS HE LED THE BAYONETS ON AT CHIPPEWA OR FORT ERIE I TAKE TO BE OF QUITE AS GENUINE A STAMP AS WHAT ACTUATES ANY OR ALL THE POLEMICAL PHILANTHROPISTS OF THE AGE
OR ONCE MORE THE ELECTRIC THRILL WOULD GIVE HER WARNING--"BEHOLD HESTER HERE IS A COMPANION AND LOOKING UP SHE WOULD DETECT THE EYES OF A YOUNG MAIDEN GLANCING AT THE SCARLET LETTER SHYLY AND ASIDE AND QUICKLY AVERTED WITH A FAINT CHILL CRIMSON IN HER CHEEKS AS IF HER PURITY WERE SOMEWHAT SULLIED BY THAT MOMENTARY GLANCE
THE NEW ABODE OF THE TWO FRIENDS WAS WITH A PIOUS WIDOW OF GOOD SOCIAL RANK WHO DWELT IN A HOUSE COVERING PRETTY NEARLY THE SITE ON WHICH THE VENERABLE STRUCTURE OF KING'S CHAPEL HAS SINCE BEEN BUILT
YES
YES
YES
ALL THE TIME THAT HE GAZED UPWARD TO THE ZENITH HE WAS NEVERTHELESS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT LITTLE PEARL WAS POINTING HER FINGER TOWARDS OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WHO STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE SCAFFOLD
SHE HARDLY KNEW HIM NOW
ALL THREE GIVE GLIMPSES OF THE SHOPS OF GROCERS BLOCK-MAKERS SLOP-SELLERS AND SHIP-CHANDLERS AROUND THE DOORS OF WHICH ARE GENERALLY TO BE SEEN LAUGHING AND GOSSIPING CLUSTERS OF OLD SALTS AND SUCH OTHER WHARF-RATS AS HAUNT THE WAPPING OF A SEAPORT
EXHORT HER TO CONFESS THE TRUTH THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE BENT HIS HEAD IN SILENT PRAYER AS IT SEEMED AND THEN CAME FORWARD
IS THERE NOT SHADE ENOUGH IN ALL THIS BOUNDLESS FOREST TO HIDE THY HEART FROM THE GAZE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH YES HESTER
ITS STURDY FORCE ITS COURAGE AND CONSTANCY ITS TRUTH ITS SELF-RELIANCE AND ALL THAT GIVES THE EMPHASIS TO MANLY CHARACTER
HOW FEEBLE AND PALE HE LOOKED AMID ALL HIS TRIUMPH
OF INTEGRITY THAT LIKE MOST OF HIS OTHER ENDOWMENTS LAY IN A SOMEWHAT HEAVY MASS AND WAS JUST AS UNMALLEABLE OR UNMANAGEABLE AS A TON OF IRON ORE
I BEGAN TO GROW MELANCHOLY AND RESTLESS
BUT AS FOR ME I COME TO THE INQUEST WITH OTHER SENSES THAN THEY POSSESS
THEY PROBABLY FANCIED THAT MY SOLE OBJECT--AND INDEED THE SOLE OBJECT FOR WHICH A SANE MAN COULD EVER PUT HIMSELF INTO VOLUNTARY MOTION--WAS TO GET AN APPETITE FOR DINNER
THE MINISTER APPEARED TO SEE HIM WITH THE SAME GLANCE THAT DISCERNED THE MIRACULOUS LETTER
WHY GOSSIPS WHAT IS IT BUT TO LAUGH IN THE FACES OF OUR GODLY MAGISTRATES AND MAKE A PRIDE OUT OF WHAT THEY WORTHY GENTLEMEN MEANT FOR A PUNISHMENT IT WERE WELL MUTTERED THE MOST IRON-VISAGED OF THE OLD DAMES IF WE STRIPPED MADAME HESTER'S RICH GOWN OFF HER DAINTY SHOULDERS
IT MAY BE WATCHED AND GUARDED SO THAT THE ENEMY SHALL NOT FORCE HIS WAY AGAIN INTO THE CITADEL AND MIGHT EVEN IN HIS SUBSEQUENT ASSAULTS SELECT SOME OTHER AVENUE IN PREFERENCE TO THAT WHERE HE HAD FORMERLY SUCCEEDED
AND HERE WAS YET TO BE HER PENITENCE
PESTILENCE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN FOREBODED BY A SHOWER OF CRIMSON LIGHT
ON THE WALL HUNG A ROW OF PORTRAITS REPRESENTING THE FOREFATHERS OF THE BELLINGHAM LINEAGE SOME WITH ARMOUR ON THEIR BREASTS AND OTHERS WITH STATELY RUFFS AND ROBES OF PEACE
SUCH WERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM I NOW FOUND MYSELF CONNECTED
WITH GOD'S HELP I SHALL ESCAPE THEE NOW HE AGAIN EXTENDED HIS HAND TO THE WOMAN OF THE SCARLET LETTER
THE STORY OF THE SCARLET LETTER GREW INTO A LEGEND
BETWEEN THEE AND ME THE SCALE HANGS FAIRLY BALANCED
IN THIS LITTLE LONESOME DWELLING WITH SOME SLENDER MEANS THAT SHE POSSESSED AND BY THE LICENCE OF THE MAGISTRATES WHO STILL KEPT AN INQUISITORIAL WATCH OVER HER HESTER ESTABLISHED HERSELF WITH HER INFANT CHILD
AND HATH ADDUCED SUCH ARGUMENTS THAT WE WILL EVEN LEAVE THE MATTER AS IT NOW STANDS
A PURE HAND NEEDS NO GLOVE TO COVER IT THANK YOU MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE MINISTER GRAVELY BUT STARTLED AT HEART
AND MOTHER THE OLD DAME SAID THAT THIS SCARLET LETTER WAS THE BLACK MAN'S MARK ON THEE AND THAT IT GLOWS LIKE A RED FLAME WHEN THOU MEETEST HIM AT MIDNIGHT HERE IN THE DARK WOOD
AND YET NO SECRET SUCH AS THE PHYSICIAN FANCIED MUST EXIST THERE EVER STOLE OUT OF THE MINISTER'S CONSCIOUSNESS INTO HIS COMPANION'S EAR
HOW FARED IT WITH HIM THEN
THERE ON THE TABLE WITH THE INKY PEN BESIDE IT WAS AN UNFINISHED SERMON WITH A SENTENCE BROKEN IN THE MIDST WHERE HIS THOUGHTS HAD CEASED TO GUSH OUT UPON THE PAGE TWO DAYS BEFORE
I HAVE LAUGHED IN BITTERNESS AND AGONY OF HEART AT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT I SEEM AND WHAT I AM
TRUE HE LOOKED DOUBTFULLY FEARFULLY--EVEN AT TIMES WITH HORROR AND THE BITTERNESS OF HATRED--AT THE DEFORMED FIGURE OF THE OLD PHYSICIAN
PEACE BE WITH ALL THE WORLD
AND SO PERCHANCE THE TORTURE OF HER DAILY SHAME WOULD AT LENGTH PURGE HER SOUL AND WORK OUT ANOTHER PURITY THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD LOST
THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO MAKE MUCH MOAN ABOUT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS
DOCTOR GRIMSHAWE'S SECRET WITH PREFACE AND NOTES BY JULIAN HAWTHORNE 1882
TO SUCH AN UNWONTED REMOTENESS HOWEVER HAD HIS SPIRIT NOW WITHDRAWN INTO ITSELF THAT HE STIRRED NOT IN HIS CHAIR WHEN OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WITHOUT ANY EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTION CAME INTO THE ROOM
SOME OF THE BRIEFER ARTICLES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO MAKE UP THE VOLUME HAVE LIKEWISE BEEN WRITTEN SINCE MY INVOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL FROM THE TOILS AND HONOURS OF PUBLIC LIFE AND THE REMAINDER ARE GLEANED FROM ANNUALS AND MAGAZINES OF SUCH ANTIQUE DATE THAT THEY HAVE GONE ROUND THE CIRCLE AND COME BACK TO NOVELTY AGAIN
THE INSTILMENT THEREOF INTO HER MIND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE CAUSED THIS AGED SISTER TO DROP DOWN DEAD AT ONCE AS BY THE EFFECT OF AN INTENSELY POISONOUS INFUSION
GOD'S EYE BEHELD IT
HE HAD SPOKEN THE VERY TRUTH AND TRANSFORMED IT INTO THE VERIEST FALSEHOOD
INDEED SO FAR AS ITS PHYSICAL ASPECT IS CONCERNED WITH ITS FLAT UNVARIED SURFACE COVERED CHIEFLY WITH WOODEN HOUSES FEW OR NONE OF WHICH PRETEND TO ARCHITECTURAL BEAUTY--ITS IRREGULARITY WHICH IS NEITHER PICTURESQUE NOR QUAINT BUT ONLY TAME--ITS LONG AND LAZY STREET LOUNGING WEARISOMELY THROUGH THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE PENINSULA WITH GALLOWS HILL AND NEW GUINEA AT ONE END AND A VIEW OF THE ALMS-HOUSE AT THE OTHER--SUCH BEING THE FEATURES OF MY NATIVE TOWN IT WOULD BE QUITE AS REASONABLE TO FORM A SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT TO A DISARRANGED CHECKER-BOARD
NOT AS A NAME EXPRESSIVE OF HER ASPECT WHICH HAD NOTHING OF THE CALM WHITE UNIMPASSIONED LUSTRE THAT WOULD BE INDICATED BY THE COMPARISON
THE EMOTION OF THAT BRIEF SPACE WHILE SHE STOOD GAZING AFTER THE CROOKED FIGURE OF OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THREW A DARK LIGHT ON HESTER'S STATE OF MIND REVEALING MUCH THAT SHE MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HERSELF
HE BIDS YOU LOOK AGAIN AT HESTER'S SCARLET LETTER
AND WHICH IT WAS THOUGHT WELL TO KEEP ALIVE ON THIS NEW SOIL FOR THE SAKE OF THE COURAGE AND MANLINESS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL IN THEM
WITH THIS SYMBOL I UNDO IT ALL AND MAKE IT AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN SO SPEAKING SHE UNDID THE CLASP THAT FASTENED THE SCARLET LETTER AND TAKING IT FROM HER BOSOM THREW IT TO A DISTANCE AMONG THE WITHERED LEAVES
AFTER TESTING BOTH SMILES AND FROWNS AND PROVING THAT NEITHER MODE OF TREATMENT POSSESSED ANY CALCULABLE INFLUENCE HESTER WAS ULTIMATELY COMPELLED TO STAND ASIDE AND PERMIT THE CHILD TO BE SWAYED BY HER OWN IMPULSES
NOW CAME THE DEAD FRIENDS OF HIS YOUTH AND HIS WHITE-BEARDED FATHER WITH A SAINT-LIKE FROWN AND HIS MOTHER TURNING HER FACE AWAY AS SHE PASSED BY
HE EXPRESSED GREAT ALARM AT HIS PASTOR'S STATE OF HEALTH BUT WAS ANXIOUS TO ATTEMPT THE CURE AND IF EARLY UNDERTAKEN SEEMED NOT DESPONDENT OF A FAVOURABLE RESULT
WAS HE WEARY OF HIS LABOURS
NO MATTER WHETHER OF LOVE OR HATE
PEARL WAS NOW SEVEN YEARS OLD
IN SOME OTHER FORM PERHAPS I MAY HEREAFTER DEVELOP THESE EFFECTS
BUT SEE NOW HOW PASSION TAKES HOLD UPON THIS MAN AND HURRIETH HIM OUT OF HIMSELF
AT ONE END OF THE ROOM IN A RECESS WERE A NUMBER OF BARRELS PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER CONTAINING BUNDLES OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
T
THE PEOPLE IN THE CASE OF WHICH WE SPEAK COULD JUSTIFY ITS PREJUDICE AGAINST ROGER CHILLINGWORTH BY NO FACT OR ARGUMENT WORTHY OF SERIOUS REFUTATION
SHE SEIZED A LIVE HORSE-SHOE BY THE TAIL AND MADE PRIZE OF SEVERAL FIVE-FINGERS AND LAID OUT A JELLY-FISH TO MELT IN THE WARM SUN
SO REVEREND SIR YOU HAVE MADE A VISIT INTO THE FOREST OBSERVED THE WITCH-LADY NODDING HER HIGH HEAD-DRESS AT HIM
NOR AS FREQUENT TRANSPLANTATION IS PERHAPS BETTER FOR THE STOCK NEED THEY CONSIDER IT DESIRABLE TO KNOW
THERE WERE FLAVOURS ON HIS PALATE THAT HAD LINGERED THERE NOT LESS THAN SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS AND WERE STILL APPARENTLY AS FRESH AS THAT OF THE MUTTON CHOP WHICH HE HAD JUST DEVOURED FOR HIS BREAKFAST
HESTER'S STRONG CALM STEADFASTLY-ENDURING SPIRIT ALMOST SANK AT LAST ON BEHOLDING THIS DARK AND GRIM COUNTENANCE OF AN INEVITABLE DOOM WHICH AT THE MOMENT WHEN A PASSAGE SEEMED TO OPEN FOR THE MINISTER AND HERSELF OUT OF THEIR LABYRINTH OF MISERY--SHOWED ITSELF WITH AN UNRELENTING SMILE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR PATH
BUT HIS CHARACTER HAD BEEN SO MUCH ENFEEBLED BY SUFFERING THAT EVEN ITS LOWER ENERGIES WERE INCAPABLE OF MORE THAN A TEMPORARY STRUGGLE
IT WAS HIS GENUINE IMPULSE TO ADORE THE TRUTH AND TO RECKON ALL THINGS SHADOW-LIKE AND UTTERLY DEVOID OF WEIGHT OR VALUE THAT HAD NOT ITS DIVINE ESSENCE AS THE LIFE WITHIN THEIR LIFE
IT WAS ONLY BY AN EXERTION OF FORCE THAT HER MOTHER BROUGHT HER UP TO HIM HANGING BACK AND MANIFESTING HER RELUCTANCE BY ODD GRIMACES
AND HIS ENCOUNTER WITH OLD MISTRESS HIBBINS IF IT WERE A REAL INCIDENT DID BUT SHOW ITS SYMPATHY AND FELLOWSHIP WITH WICKED MORTALS AND THE WORLD OF PERVERTED SPIRITS
THOU WOULDST NOT YONDER IN THE FOREST
IN THE FIRST PLACE MY COADJUTORS WERE NOT INVARIABLY OLD
HAST THOU FORGOTTEN IT HUSH HESTER SAID ARTHUR DIMMESDALE RISING FROM THE GROUND
A GREAT RED LETTER IN THE SKY--THE LETTER A WHICH WE INTERPRET TO STAND FOR ANGEL
THE SHOUT DIED INTO A MURMUR AS ONE PORTION OF THE CROWD AFTER ANOTHER OBTAINED A GLIMPSE OF HIM
COME GOOD SIR AND MY DEAR FRIEND I PRAY YOU LET ME LEAD YOU HOME HOW KNEWEST THOU THAT I WAS HERE ASKED THE MINISTER FEARFULLY
BUT THAT FIRST OBJECT OF WHICH PEARL SEEMED TO BECOME AWARE WAS--SHALL WE SAY IT?--THE SCARLET LETTER ON HESTER'S BOSOM
THUS BY AN INEVITABLE NECESSITY AS A MAGNET ATTRACTS STEEL-FILINGS SO DID OUR MAN OF BUSINESS DRAW TO HIMSELF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH EVERYBODY MET WITH
IT PASSED AS SUDDENLY AS IT CAME
HIS INWARD TROUBLE DROVE HIM TO PRACTICES MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OLD CORRUPTED FAITH OF ROME THAN WITH THE BETTER LIGHT OF THE CHURCH IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED
JAPP PSEUD
IT WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SAD--THEN WHAT DEPTH OF SORROW TO A MOTHER WHO FELT IN HER OWN HEART THE CAUSE--TO OBSERVE IN ONE SO YOUNG THIS CONSTANT RECOGNITION OF AN ADVERSE WORLD AND SO FIERCE A TRAINING OF THE ENERGIES THAT WERE TO MAKE GOOD HER CAUSE IN THE CONTEST THAT MUST ENSUE
AND WHEREFORE SHOULD IT NOT BRING YOU PEACE NO HESTER--NO REPLIED THE CLERGYMAN
THOU AND THINE HESTER PRYNNE BELONG TO ME
DOST KNOW THY CATECHISM
THEN SHE TOOK UP THE WHITE FOAM THAT STREAKED THE LINE OF THE ADVANCING TIDE AND THREW IT UPON THE BREEZE SCAMPERING AFTER IT WITH WINGED FOOTSTEPS TO CATCH THE GREAT SNOWFLAKES ERE THEY FELL
IF THE LATTER POSSESS NATIVE SAGACITY AND A NAMELESS SOMETHING MORE,--LET US CALL IT INTUITION
THE PROCESSION CHAPTER XXIII
HESTER SAW AND RECOGNIZED THE SELFSAME FACES OF THAT GROUP OF MATRONS WHO HAD AWAITED HER FORTHCOMING FROM THE PRISON-DOOR SEVEN YEARS AGO
OWING THIS DREARY RESEMBLANCE TO THE FACT THAT HESTER WAS ACTUALLY DEAD IN RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF SYMPATHY AND HAD DEPARTED OUT OF THE WORLD WITH WHICH SHE STILL SEEMED TO MINGLE
MORE BEAUTIFUL ONES THAN WE FIND IN THE WOODS PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW-WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY-SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
IT IS THOU THAT MUST TELL ME BUT HESTER COULD NOT RESOLVE THE QUERY BEING HERSELF IN A DISMAL LABYRINTH OF DOUBT
BUT SHE COMES AT A GOOD TIME AND WE WILL LOOK INTO THIS MATTER FORTHWITH GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM STEPPED THROUGH THE WINDOW INTO THE HALL FOLLOWED BY HIS THREE GUESTS
CABBAGES GREW IN PLAIN SIGHT
HUSH NOW GOSSIPS FOR THE LOCK IS TURNING IN THE PRISON-DOOR AND HERE COMES MISTRESS PRYNNE HERSELF THE DOOR OF THE JAIL BEING FLUNG OPEN FROM WITHIN THERE APPEARED IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE A BLACK SHADOW EMERGING INTO SUNSHINE THE GRIM AND GRISTLY PRESENCE OF THE TOWN-BEADLE WITH A SWORD BY HIS SIDE AND HIS STAFF OF OFFICE IN HIS HAND
AFTER EXHAUSTING LIFE IN HIS EFFORTS FOR MANKIND'S SPIRITUAL GOOD HE HAD MADE THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH A PARABLE IN ORDER TO IMPRESS ON HIS ADMIRERS THE MIGHTY AND MOURNFUL LESSON THAT IN THE VIEW OF INFINITE PURITY WE ARE SINNERS ALL ALIKE
NOT BUT THE METEOR MAY HAVE SHOWN ITSELF AT THAT POINT BURNING DUSKILY THROUGH A VEIL OF CLOUD BUT WITH NO SUCH SHAPE AS HIS GUILTY IMAGINATION GAVE IT OR AT LEAST WITH SO LITTLE DEFINITENESS THAT ANOTHER'S GUILT MIGHT HAVE SEEN ANOTHER SYMBOL IN IT
A SCROLL SO WIDE MIGHT NOT BE DEEMED TOO EXPENSIVE FOR PROVIDENCE TO WRITE A PEOPLE'S DOOM UPON
THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER SLOWLY AS THE MINISTER WALKED HE HAD ALMOST GONE BY BEFORE HESTER PRYNNE COULD GATHER VOICE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT HIS OBSERVATION
AS IF A COMPANY OF DEVILS DETECTING SO MUCH MISERY AND TERROR IN IT HAD MADE A PLAYTHING OF THE SOUND AND WERE BANDYING IT TO AND FRO
AND THUS WHILE STANDING ON THE SCAFFOLD IN THIS VAIN SHOW OF EXPIATION MR DIMMESDALE WAS OVERCOME WITH A GREAT HORROR OF MIND AS IF THE UNIVERSE WERE GAZING AT A SCARLET TOKEN ON HIS NAKED BREAST RIGHT OVER HIS HEART
EVERYTHING WAS AGAINST HER
HE HAS NO CONCEPTION OF THE OYSTER-LIKE TENACITY WITH WHICH AN OLD SETTLER OVER WHOM HIS THIRD CENTURY IS CREEPING CLINGS TO THE SPOT WHERE HIS SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED
DO NOT LET HER HEAR YOU
IT MUST NEEDS BE A DELUSION
BUT IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT IN A SINGLE INSTANCE HER SKILL WAS CALLED IN TO EMBROIDER THE WHITE VEIL WHICH WAS TO COVER THE PURE BLUSHES OF A BRIDE
HESTER DID NOT PLUCK THEM OFF
HITHER LIKEWISE WOULD COME THE ELDERS AND DEACONS OF MR DIMMESDALE'S CHURCH AND THE YOUNG VIRGINS WHO SO IDOLIZED THEIR MINISTER AND HAD MADE A SHRINE FOR HIM IN THEIR WHITE BOSOMS WHICH NOW BY-THE-BYE IN THEIR HURRY AND CONFUSION THEY WOULD SCANTLY HAVE GIVEN THEMSELVES TIME TO COVER WITH THEIR KERCHIEFS
HER SEX HER YOUTH AND THE WHOLE RICHNESS OF HER BEAUTY CAME BACK FROM WHAT MEN CALL THE IRREVOCABLE PAST AND CLUSTERED THEMSELVES WITH HER MAIDEN HOPE AND A HAPPINESS BEFORE UNKNOWN WITHIN THE MAGIC CIRCLE OF THIS HOUR
BESEECHING ITS SYMPATHY OR FORGIVENESS,--AT EVERY MOMENT,--IN EACH ACCENT,--AND NEVER IN VAIN
THEIR MINISTER WHOM THEY SO LOVED--AND WHO SO LOVED THEM ALL THAT HE COULD NOT DEPART HEAVENWARD WITHOUT A SIGH--HAD THE FOREBODING OF UNTIMELY DEATH UPON HIM AND WOULD SOON LEAVE THEM IN THEIR TEARS
WHY LOOK YOU SHE MAY COVER IT WITH A BROOCH OR SUCH LIKE HEATHENISH ADORNMENT AND SO WALK THE STREETS AS BRAVE AS EVER AH BUT INTERPOSED MORE SOFTLY A YOUNG WIFE HOLDING A CHILD BY THE HAND LET HER COVER THE MARK AS SHE WILL THE PANG OF IT WILL BE ALWAYS IN HER HEART WHAT DO WE TALK OF MARKS AND BRANDS WHETHER ON THE BODICE OF HER GOWN OR THE FLESH OF HER FOREHEAD CRIED ANOTHER FEMALE THE UGLIEST AS WELL AS THE MOST PITILESS OF THESE SELF-CONSTITUTED JUDGES
A MAN OF THOUGHT FANCY AND SENSIBILITY HAD HE TEN TIMES THE SURVEYOR'S PROPORTION OF THOSE QUALITIES MAY AT ANY TIME BE A MAN OF AFFAIRS IF HE WILL ONLY CHOOSE TO GIVE HIMSELF THE TROUBLE
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A WORK OF VAST ABILITY IN THE SOMNIFEROUS SCHOOL OF LITERATURE
YONDER WOMAN SIR YOU MUST KNOW WAS THE WIFE OF A CERTAIN LEARNED MAN ENGLISH BY BIRTH BUT WHO HAD LONG AGO DWELT IN AMSTERDAM WHENCE SOME GOOD TIME AGONE HE WAS MINDED TO CROSS OVER AND CAST IN HIS LOT WITH US OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
AND I WELL-NIGH PROMISED THE BLACK MAN THAT COMELY HESTER PRYNNE SHOULD MAKE ONE MAKE MY EXCUSE TO HIM SO PLEASE YOU ANSWERED HESTER WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE
AY AY YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN IT
WHY DOES HE DO SO MOTHER HE REMEMBERS THEE A LITTLE BABE MY CHILD ANSWERED HESTER
SUCH A SPIRITUAL SEER MIGHT HAVE CONCEIVED THAT AFTER SUSTAINING THE GAZE OF THE MULTITUDE THROUGH SEVERAL MISERABLE YEARS AS A NECESSITY A PENANCE AND SOMETHING WHICH IT WAS A STERN RELIGION TO ENDURE SHE NOW FOR ONE LAST TIME MORE ENCOUNTERED IT FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY IN ORDER TO CONVERT WHAT HAD SO LONG BEEN AGONY INTO A KIND OF TRIUMPH
AND THERE IS A WEIGHTY IMPORT IN WHAT MY YOUNG BROTHER HATH SPOKEN ADDED THE REV
OUR LITTLE PEARL
J
BUT SHE SAID IT WITH A HESITATION THAT DID NOT ESCAPE THE ACUTENESS OF THE CHILD
I LOOKED UPON IT AS AN EVIDENCE IN SOME MEASURE OF A SYSTEM NATURALLY WELL BALANCED AND LACKING NO ESSENTIAL PART OF A THOROUGH ORGANIZATION THAT WITH SUCH ASSOCIATES TO REMEMBER I COULD MINGLE AT ONCE WITH MEN OF ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT QUALITIES AND NEVER MURMUR AT THE CHANGE
WEIGHT SOLIDITY FIRMNESS--THIS WAS THE EXPRESSION OF HIS REPOSE EVEN IN SUCH DECAY AS HAD CREPT UNTIMELY OVER HIM AT THE PERIOD OF WHICH I SPEAK
SHE NOW SKIPPED IRREVERENTLY FROM ONE GRAVE TO ANOTHER
BUT THERE WAS A MORE REAL LIFE FOR HESTER PRYNNE HERE IN NEW ENGLAND THAN IN THAT UNKNOWN REGION WHERE PEARL HAD FOUND A HOME
I AM A STRANGER AND HAVE BEEN A WANDERER SORELY AGAINST MY WILL
ALL AND ESPECIALLY THE HELMET AND BREASTPLATE SO HIGHLY BURNISHED AS TO GLOW WITH WHITE RADIANCE AND SCATTER AN ILLUMINATION EVERYWHERE ABOUT UPON THE FLOOR
IT MIGHT BE THAT A SLUGGISH BOND-SERVANT OR AN UNDUTIFUL CHILD WHOM HIS PARENTS HAD GIVEN OVER TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITY WAS TO BE CORRECTED AT THE WHIPPING-POST
IF THOU CALLEST ME THAT ILL-NAME I SHALL TELL HIM OF THEE AND HE WILL CHASE THY SHIP WITH A TEMPEST PURSUING A ZIGZAG COURSE ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE THE CHILD RETURNED TO HER MOTHER AND COMMUNICATED WHAT THE MARINER HAD SAID
THE SHADOW OF THE CURTAIN FELL ON HESTER PRYNNE AND PARTIALLY CONCEALED HER
AS AT THE WAVING OF A MAGICIAN'S WAND UP ROSE A GRISLY PHANTOM--UP ROSE A THOUSAND PHANTOMS--IN MANY SHAPES OF DEATH OR MORE AWFUL SHAME ALL FLOCKING ROUND ABOUT THE CLERGYMAN AND POINTING WITH THEIR FINGERS AT HIS BREAST
THIS IN FACT--A DESIRE TO PUT MYSELF IN MY TRUE POSITION AS EDITOR OR VERY LITTLE MORE OF THE MOST PROLIX AMONG THE TALES THAT MAKE UP MY VOLUME--THIS AND NO OTHER IS MY TRUE REASON FOR ASSUMING A PERSONAL RELATION WITH THE PUBLIC
YEA THEY ARE THE CURRENT GOLD COIN OF THE NEW JERUSALEM WITH THE KING'S OWN MINT MARK ON THEM LEFT ALONE THE MINISTER SUMMONED A SERVANT OF THE HOUSE AND REQUESTED FOOD WHICH BEING SET BEFORE HIM HE ATE WITH RAVENOUS APPETITE
AT ALL EVENTS IF IT INVOLVED ANY SECRET INFORMATION IN REGARD TO OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH IT WAS IN A TONGUE UNKNOWN TO THE ERUDITE CLERGYMAN AND DID BUT INCREASE THE BEWILDERMENT OF HIS MIND
THEY HEARD IT ALL AND DID BUT REVERENCE HIM THE MORE
III
IN SHORT UNPLEASANT AS WAS MY PREDICAMENT AT BEST I SAW MUCH REASON TO CONGRATULATE MYSELF THAT I WAS ON THE LOSING SIDE RATHER THAN THE TRIUMPHANT ONE
BUT THE TOWN WAS ALL ASLEEP
SHE MADE NO CLAIM UPON IT IN REQUITAL FOR WHAT SHE SUFFERED
AT THE GREAT JUDGMENT DAY WHISPERED THE MINISTER
HOW UNLIKE ALAS THE HANGDOG LOOK OF A REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL WHO AS THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE FEELS HIMSELF LESS THAN THE LEAST AND BELOW THE LOWEST OF HIS MASTERS
WHAT WILL NOW BE THE COURSE OF HIS REVENGE THERE IS A STRANGE SECRECY IN HIS NATURE REPLIED HESTER THOUGHTFULLY
NATURE--EXCEPT IT WERE HUMAN NATURE--THE NATURE THAT IS DEVELOPED IN EARTH AND SKY WAS IN ONE SENSE HIDDEN FROM ME
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE IN WHAT RESPECT THEY DIFFERED FROM THE INDIVIDUALS ON WHOM HE HAD SO RECENTLY BESTOWED A PARTING GLANCE
THIS LAST ATTRIBUTE HOWEVER HAD BEEN LESS CAREFULLY DEVELOPED THAN HIS INTELLECTUAL GIFTS AND WAS IN TRUTH RATHER A MATTER OF SHAME THAN SELF-CONGRATULATION WITH HIM
UNLESS INDEED AS OFTEN URGED BY SUCH AS FELT AUTHORISED TO DO SO HE HAD SELECTED SOME ONE OF THE MANY BLOOMING DAMSELS SPIRITUALLY DEVOTED TO HIM TO BECOME HIS DEVOTED WIFE
OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WITH A SMILE ON HIS FACE WHISPERED SOMETHING IN THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN'S EAR
THE CHILD IS YOURS--SHE IS NONE OF MINE--NEITHER WILL SHE RECOGNISE MY VOICE OR ASPECT AS A FATHER'S
AND IT WAS QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR MY NECESSITIES
IF HE DISCERN SUCH SINFULNESS IN HIS OWN WHITE SOUL WHAT HORRID SPECTACLE WOULD HE BEHOLD IN THINE OR MINE THE MINISTER WELL KNEW--SUBTLE BUT REMORSEFUL HYPOCRITE THAT HE WAS!--THE LIGHT IN WHICH HIS VAGUE CONFESSION WOULD BE VIEWED
CONCLUSION THE CUSTOM-HOUSE INTRODUCTORY TO THE SCARLET LETTER IT IS A LITTLE REMARKABLE THAT--THOUGH DISINCLINED TO TALK OVERMUCH OF MYSELF AND MY AFFAIRS AT THE FIRESIDE AND TO MY PERSONAL FRIENDS--AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL IMPULSE SHOULD TWICE IN MY LIFE HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION OF ME IN ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC
IT WAS A FOLLY WITH THE MATERIALITY OF THIS DAILY LIFE PRESSING SO INTRUSIVELY UPON ME TO ATTEMPT TO FLING MYSELF BACK INTO ANOTHER AGE OR TO INSIST ON CREATING THE SEMBLANCE OF A WORLD OUT OF AIRY MATTER WHEN AT EVERY MOMENT THE IMPALPABLE BEAUTY OF MY SOAP-BUBBLE WAS BROKEN BY THE RUDE CONTACT OF SOME ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCE
ALL SUCH PROFESSORS OF THE SEVERAL BRANCHES OF JOCULARITY WOULD HAVE BEEN STERNLY REPRESSED NOT ONLY BY THE RIGID DISCIPLINE OF LAW BUT BY THE GENERAL SENTIMENT WHICH GIVE LAW ITS VITALITY
THE PINE-TREES AGED BLACK AND SOLEMN AND FLINGING GROANS AND OTHER MELANCHOLY UTTERANCES ON THE BREEZE NEEDED LITTLE TRANSFORMATION TO FIGURE AS PURITAN ELDERS
IF IN ALL THESE PAST SEVEN YEARS THOUGHT HE I COULD RECALL ONE INSTANT OF PEACE OR HOPE I WOULD YET ENDURE FOR THE SAKE OF THAT EARNEST OF HEAVEN'S MERCY
SO--WITH A MIGHTIER STRUGGLE THAN HE HAD YET SUSTAINED--HE HELD HIS GENEVA CLOAK BEFORE HIS FACE AND HURRIED ONWARD MAKING NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION AND LEAVING THE YOUNG SISTER TO DIGEST HIS RUDENESS AS SHE MIGHT
THE WOODEN HOUSES WITH THEIR JUTTING STOREYS AND QUAINT GABLE-PEAKS
HER NEEDLE-WORK WAS SEEN ON THE RUFF OF THE GOVERNOR
IT WAS WITH FEAR AND TREMULOUSLY AND AS IT WERE BY A SLOW RELUCTANT NECESSITY THAT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE PUT FORTH HIS HAND CHILL AS DEATH AND TOUCHED THE CHILL HAND OF HESTER PRYNNE
THERE IS NOTHING LOST
AS THEY DESCENDED THE STEPS IT IS AVERRED THAT THE LATTICE OF A CHAMBER-WINDOW WAS THROWN OPEN AND FORTH INTO THE SUNNY DAY WAS THRUST THE FACE OF MISTRESS HIBBINS GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S BITTER-TEMPERED SISTER AND THE SAME WHO A FEW YEARS LATER WAS EXECUTED AS A WITCH
HE ABSOLUTELY TREMBLED AND TURNED PALE AS ASHES LEST HIS TONGUE SHOULD WAG ITSELF IN UTTERANCE OF THESE HORRIBLE MATTERS AND PLEAD HIS OWN CONSENT FOR SO DOING WITHOUT HIS HAVING FAIRLY GIVEN IT
THIS WOMAN HAS BROUGHT SHAME UPON US ALL AND OUGHT TO DIE
FOR UPWARDS OF TWENTY YEARS BEFORE THIS EPOCH THE INDEPENDENT POSITION OF THE COLLECTOR HAD KEPT THE SALEM CUSTOM-HOUSE OUT OF THE WHIRLPOOL OF POLITICAL VICISSITUDE WHICH MAKES THE TENURE OF OFFICE GENERALLY SO FRAGILE
HIS INTELLECTUAL GIFTS HIS MORAL PERCEPTIONS HIS POWER OF EXPERIENCING AND COMMUNICATING EMOTION WERE KEPT IN A STATE OF PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY BY THE PRICK AND ANGUISH OF HIS DAILY LIFE
PERHAPS THIS TOO WAS A DISEASE AND BUT THE REFLEX OF THE WILD ENERGY WITH WHICH HESTER HAD FOUGHT AGAINST HER SORROWS BEFORE PEARL'S BIRTH
SHE TURNED HER EYES DOWNWARD AT THE SCARLET LETTER AND EVEN TOUCHED IT WITH HER FINGER TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE INFANT AND THE SHAME WERE REAL
THUS WE SEEM TO SEE THAT AS REGARDED HESTER PRYNNE THE WHOLE SEVEN YEARS OF OUTLAW AND IGNOMINY HAD BEEN LITTLE OTHER THAN A PREPARATION FOR THIS VERY HOUR
HEAVEN GRANT IT BE A BETTER ONE
SO THAT WHEN THE SUNSHINE FELL ASLANT-WISE OVER THE FRONT OF THE EDIFICE IT GLITTERED AND SPARKLED AS IF DIAMONDS HAD BEEN FLUNG AGAINST IT BY THE DOUBLE HANDFUL
THE SCARLET LETTER HAD NOT DONE ITS OFFICE
THAT WAS ALL
WHAT WAS IT
AND IS IT MISTRESS HESTER THAT HAS A WORD FOR OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH ANSWERED HE RAISING HIMSELF FROM HIS STOOPING POSTURE
OR AM I GIVEN OVER UTTERLY TO THE FIEND
SO LET THY MOTHER TAKE NO THOUGHT SAVE FOR HERSELF AND THEE
SHE STROVE TO HUSH IT MECHANICALLY BUT SEEMED SCARCELY TO SYMPATHISE WITH ITS TROUBLE
IN THE COTTAGE THERE WERE ARTICLES OF COMFORT AND LUXURY SUCH AS HESTER NEVER CARED TO USE BUT WHICH ONLY WEALTH COULD HAVE PURCHASED AND AFFECTION HAVE IMAGINED FOR HER
A SIMILAR IMPRESSION STRUCK HIM MOST REMARKABLY AS HE PASSED UNDER THE WALLS OF HIS OWN CHURCH
WITHOUT QUESTION SHE IS EQUALLY IN THE DARK AS TO HER SOUL ITS PRESENT DEPRAVITY AND FUTURE DESTINY
IT IS OUR HESTER--THE TOWN'S OWN HESTER--WHO IS SO KIND TO THE POOR SO HELPFUL TO THE SICK SO COMFORTABLE TO THE AFFLICTED THEN IT IS TRUE THE PROPENSITY OF HUMAN NATURE TO TELL THE VERY WORST OF ITSELF WHEN EMBODIED IN THE PERSON OF ANOTHER WOULD CONSTRAIN THEM TO WHISPER THE BLACK SCANDAL OF BYGONE YEARS
IT HAD SHOWN HIM WHERE TO SET HIS FOOT WHILE THE LIGHT OF EARTH WAS FAST BECOMING DIM AND ERE THE LIGHT OF FUTURITY COULD REACH HIM
WHAT IS IT THAT HAUNTS AND TEMPTS ME THUS CRIED THE MINISTER TO HIMSELF AT LENGTH PAUSING IN THE STREET AND STRIKING HIS HAND AGAINST HIS FOREHEAD
IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT--AND IT WAS SO--TO CONCEIVE HOW HE SHOULD EXIST HEREAFTER SO EARTHLY AND SENSUOUS DID HE SEEM
A MOMENT LONGER MY CHILD SAID HE
BUT WHETHER IT HAD MERELY SURVIVED OUT OF THE STERN OLD WILDERNESS SO LONG AFTER THE FALL OF THE GIGANTIC PINES AND OAKS THAT ORIGINALLY OVERSHADOWED IT OR WHETHER AS THERE IS FAIR AUTHORITY FOR BELIEVING IT HAD SPRUNG UP UNDER THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE SAINTED ANN HUTCHINSON AS SHE ENTERED THE PRISON-DOOR WE SHALL NOT TAKE UPON US TO DETERMINE
FOR WITH THE NEW ENERGY OF THE MOMENT ALL THE DREAD OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE THAT HAD SO LONG BEEN THE ANGUISH OF HIS LIFE HAD RETURNED UPON HIM
BEWARE I WILL KEEP THY SECRET AS I HAVE HIS SAID HESTER
OR WAS THERE AS IT RATHER SEEMED A CIRCLE OF OMINOUS SHADOW MOVING ALONG WITH HIS DEFORMITY WHICHEVER WAY HE TURNED HIMSELF
NOT IMPROBABLY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WROUGHT A VERY MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE PUBLIC ESTIMATION
ONE PECULIARITY OF THE CHILD'S DEPORTMENT REMAINS YET TO BE TOLD
FORGIVE AND LEAVE HIS FURTHER RETRIBUTION TO THE POWER THAT CLAIMS IT
THE FIRST TIME WAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS SINCE WHEN I FAVOURED THE READER--INEXCUSABLY AND FOR NO EARTHLY REASON THAT EITHER THE INDULGENT READER OR THE INTRUSIVE AUTHOR COULD IMAGINE--WITH A DESCRIPTION OF MY WAY OF LIFE IN THE DEEP QUIETUDE OF AN OLD MANSE
ONE OF HIS CLERICAL BRETHREN--IT WAS THE VENERABLE JOHN WILSON--OBSERVING THE STATE IN WHICH MR DIMMESDALE WAS LEFT BY THE RETIRING WAVE OF INTELLECT AND SENSIBILITY STEPPED FORWARD HASTILY TO OFFER HIS SUPPORT
STRANGE TOO FOR ONE WHO HAS KEPT HIS CALMNESS THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST TO OBSERVE THE BLOODTHIRSTINESS THAT IS DEVELOPED IN THE HOUR OF TRIUMPH AND TO BE CONSCIOUS THAT HE IS HIMSELF AMONG ITS OBJECTS
GOOD MASTER DIMMESDALE SAID HE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS WOMAN'S SOUL LIES GREATLY WITH YOU
IT WAS ONLY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A SERVANT AND BY LEANING HIS HAND HEAVILY ON THE IRON BALUSTRADE THAT HE COULD SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY ASCEND THE CUSTOM-HOUSE STEPS AND WITH A TOILSOME PROGRESS ACROSS THE FLOOR ATTAIN HIS CUSTOMARY CHAIR BESIDE THE FIREPLACE
AND HE KISSES MY FOREHEAD TOO SO THAT THE LITTLE BROOK WOULD HARDLY WASH IT OFF
BUT INDEED HE WAS BLIND AND FOOLISH AS HE EVER AND ALWAYS IS
TRUST ME SUCH MEN DECEIVE THEMSELVES IT MAY BE SO SAID THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN INDIFFERENTLY AS WAIVING A DISCUSSION THAT HE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT OR UNSEASONABLE
IT HAD BEEN HER HABIT FROM AN ALMOST IMMEMORIAL DATE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY AS A KIND OF VOLUNTARY NURSE AND DOING WHATEVER MISCELLANEOUS GOOD SHE MIGHT
ELSE I MUST COME TO THEE BUT PEARL NOT A WHIT STARTLED AT HER MOTHER'S THREATS ANY MORE THAN MOLLIFIED BY HER ENTREATIES NOW SUDDENLY BURST INTO A FIT OF PASSION GESTICULATING VIOLENTLY AND THROWING HER SMALL FIGURE INTO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT CONTORTIONS
HIS PERVADING AND CONTINUAL HOPE--A HALLUCINATION WHICH IN THE FACE OF ALL DISCOURAGEMENT AND MAKING LIGHT OF IMPOSSIBILITIES HAUNTS HIM WHILE HE LIVES AND I FANCY LIKE THE CONVULSIVE THROES OF THE CHOLERA TORMENTS HIM FOR A BRIEF SPACE AFTER DEATH--IS THAT FINALLY AND IN NO LONG TIME BY SOME HAPPY COINCIDENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHALL BE RESTORED TO OFFICE
HE LED THERE A SHY AND RATHER SOMBRE LIFE
AND IN SO INTENSE A MOMENT HIS DEMEANOUR WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN CALM
WILL HE GO BACK WITH US HAND IN HAND WE THREE TOGETHER INTO THE TOWN NOT NOW MY CHILD ANSWERED HESTER
SO STRANGELY DID THEY MEET IN THE DIM WOOD THAT IT WAS LIKE THE FIRST ENCOUNTER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE OF TWO SPIRITS WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATELY CONNECTED IN THEIR FORMER LIFE BUT NOW STOOD COLDLY SHUDDERING IN MUTUAL DREAD AS NOT YET FAMILIAR WITH THEIR STATE NOR WONTED TO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF DISEMBODIED BEINGS
BUT THOU WILT LOVE HER DEARLY AS I DO AND WILT ADVISE ME HOW TO DEAL WITH HER DOST THOU THINK THE CHILD WILL BE GLAD TO KNOW ME ASKED THE MINISTER SOMEWHAT UNEASILY
THE FLOURISH OF OLD HEROIC MUSIC HEARD THIRTY YEARS BEFORE--SUCH SCENES AND SOUNDS PERHAPS WERE ALL ALIVE BEFORE HIS INTELLECTUAL SENSE
DOTH THIS BRING THEE NO COMFORT MORE MISERY HESTER!--ONLY THE MORE MISERY ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN WITH A BITTER SMILE
OUR PEARL IS A FITFUL AND FANTASTIC LITTLE ELF SOMETIMES
BY ITS PERFECT SHAPE ITS VIGOUR AND ITS NATURAL DEXTERITY IN THE USE OF ALL ITS UNTRIED LIMBS THE INFANT WAS WORTHY TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH IN EDEN
LASTLY THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN THEIR OWN INTEREST IN THIS WORN-OUT SUBJECT LANGUIDLY REVIVING ITSELF BY SYMPATHY WITH WHAT THEY SAW OTHERS FEEL LOUNGED IDLY TO THE SAME QUARTER AND TORMENTED HESTER PRYNNE PERHAPS MORE THAN ALL THE REST WITH THEIR COOL WELL-ACQUAINTED GAZE AT HER FAMILIAR SHAME
CHILD WHAT ART THOU CRIED THE MOTHER
DEMOCRATIC REVIEW 1838-1846
A PIGEON ALONE ON A LOW BRANCH ALLOWED PEARL TO COME BENEATH AND UTTERED A SOUND AS MUCH OF GREETING AS ALARM
ROGER CHILLINGWORTH KNOWS YOUR PURPOSE TO REVEAL HIS TRUE CHARACTER
DOST THOU NOT SEE WHAT I WOULD SAY
THE TRAITS OF CHARACTER HERE INDICATED WERE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE SQUARE CAST OF COUNTENANCE AND LARGE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW COLONIAL MAGISTRATES
BUT THE CHILD DID NOT SEE FIT TO LET THE MATTER DROP
AND SHE SAW THAT OWING TO THE PECULIAR EFFECT OF THIS CONVEX MIRROR THE SCARLET LETTER WAS REPRESENTED IN EXAGGERATED AND GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS SO AS TO BE GREATLY THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF HER APPEARANCE
SHE HAD RETURNED THEREFORE AND RESUMED--OF HER OWN FREE WILL FOR NOT THE STERNEST MAGISTRATE OF THAT IRON PERIOD WOULD HAVE IMPOSED IT--RESUMED THE SYMBOL OF WHICH WE HAVE RELATED SO DARK A TALE
UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS HE NEVERTHELESS AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE CONTINUED HIS HABITS OF SOCIAL FAMILIARITY WITH THE OLD MAN AND THUS GAVE HIM CONSTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERFECTING THE PURPOSE TO WHICH--POOR FORLORN CREATURE THAT HE WAS AND MORE WRETCHED THAN HIS VICTIM--THE AVENGER HAD DEVOTED HIMSELF
HE WAITS TO WELCOME THEE REPLIED HER MOTHER
OR PERCHANCE HIS SENSITIVE TEMPERAMENT WAS INVIGORATED BY THE LOUD AND PIERCING MUSIC THAT SWELLED HEAVEN-WARD AND UPLIFTED HIM ON ITS ASCENDING WAVE
IT WAS SO ARTISTICALLY DONE AND WITH SO MUCH FERTILITY AND GORGEOUS LUXURIANCE OF FANCY THAT IT HAD ALL THE EFFECT OF A LAST AND FITTING DECORATION TO THE APPAREL WHICH SHE WORE AND WHICH WAS OF A SPLENDOUR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TASTE OF THE AGE BUT GREATLY BEYOND WHAT WAS ALLOWED BY THE SUMPTUARY REGULATIONS OF THE COLONY
SHALL I LIE DOWN AGAIN ON THESE WITHERED LEAVES WHERE I CAST MYSELF WHEN THOU DIDST TELL ME WHAT HE WAS
NOTHING WAS MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE INSTINCT AS IT SEEMED WITH WHICH THE CHILD COMPREHENDED HER LONELINESS
WHAT WITH THE SHIP'S SURGEON AND THIS OTHER DOCTOR OUR ONLY DANGER WILL BE FROM DRUG OR PILL
THE LATTER HAD HIS SUSPICIONS INDEED THAT EVEN THE NATURE OF MR DIMMESDALE'S BODILY DISEASE HAD NEVER FAIRLY BEEN REVEALED TO HIM
THERE WAS AN AGED HANDICRAFTSMAN IT IS TRUE WHO HAD BEEN A CITIZEN OF LONDON AT THE PERIOD OF SIR THOMAS OVERBURY'S MURDER NOW SOME THIRTY YEARS AGONE
CERTAINLY THERE WAS SOME DEEP MEANING IN IT MOST WORTHY OF INTERPRETATION AND WHICH AS IT WERE STREAMED FORTH FROM THE MYSTIC SYMBOL SUBTLY COMMUNICATING ITSELF TO MY SENSIBILITIES BUT EVADING THE ANALYSIS OF MY MIND
WE MUST NEEDS TALK THUS IN THE DAYTIME
IT COULD HAVE BETOKENED NOTHING SHORT OF THE ANTICIPATED EXECUTION OF SOME NOTED CULPRIT ON WHOM THE SENTENCE OF A LEGAL TRIBUNAL HAD BUT CONFIRMED THE VERDICT OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT
BUT THE FORMER ASPECT OF AN INTELLECTUAL AND STUDIOUS MAN CALM AND QUIET WHICH WAS WHAT SHE BEST REMEMBERED IN HIM HAD ALTOGETHER VANISHED AND BEEN SUCCEEDED BY AN EAGER SEARCHING ALMOST FIERCE YET CAREFULLY GUARDED LOOK
OR WOULD HE SPREAD BAT'S WINGS AND FLEE AWAY LOOKING SO MUCH THE UGLIER THE HIGHER HE ROSE TOWARDS HEAVEN
MANY A TIME AFTERWARDS HAD HESTER BEEN TORTURED THOUGH LESS VIVIDLY BY THE SAME ILLUSION
SHE HAD NOT KNOWN THE WEIGHT UNTIL SHE FELT THE FREEDOM
SHE IS A STRANGE CHILD
SHE NEEDS NO OLD WOMAN'S BROOMSTICK TO FLY WITHAL A STRANGE CHILD REMARKED OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
PARTLY BY HER OWN RESERVE AND PARTLY BY THE INSTINCTIVE THOUGH NO LONGER SO UNKINDLY WITHDRAWAL OF HER FELLOW-CREATURES
IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH TO DISCERN THAT THE OLD FELLOWS DREADED SOME SUCH DISCOURTESY AT MY HANDS
I SHALL SEEK THIS MAN AS I HAVE SOUGHT TRUTH IN BOOKS
A SOLDIER--NEW ENGLAND'S MOST DISTINGUISHED SOLDIER--HE STOOD FIRMLY ON THE PEDESTAL OF HIS GALLANT SERVICES
IS IT A PLAY-DAY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
ALONE WITH THY INFANT AND THE SCARLET LETTER
WORTHY TO HAVE BEEN LEFT THERE TO BE THE PLAYTHING OF THE ANGELS AFTER THE WORLD'S FIRST PARENTS WERE DRIVEN OUT
HE LONGED TO SPEAK OUT FROM HIS OWN PULPIT AT THE FULL HEIGHT OF HIS VOICE AND TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT HE WAS
IT WAS NOT INDEED PRECISELY THAT WHICH HE HAD LAID OUT FOR HIMSELF TO TREAD
WOMEN DERIVE A PLEASURE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO THE OTHER SEX FROM THE DELICATE TOIL OF THE NEEDLE
NOT TO HIDE THE TRUTH MISTRESS HESTER MY THOUGHTS HAPPEN JUST NOW TO BE BUSY WITH THE GENTLEMAN
NO MY LITTLE PEARL SAID HER MOTHER
THEN WHY--SINCE THE CHOICE WAS WITH HIMSELF--SHOULD THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE CONNEXION WITH THE FALLEN WOMAN HAD BEEN THE MOST INTIMATE AND SACRED OF THEM ALL COME FORWARD TO VINDICATE HIS CLAIM TO AN INHERITANCE SO LITTLE DESIRABLE
THOUGHTS LIKE THESE--AND PERHAPS OTHER THOUGHTS WHICH THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OR DEFINE--THREW AN AWE ABOUT THE CHILD AS SHE CAME ONWARD
SO SPEAK FREELY AND I WILL MAKE ANSWER WHEN WE LAST SPAKE TOGETHER SAID HESTER NOW SEVEN YEARS AGO IT WAS YOUR PLEASURE TO EXTORT A PROMISE OF SECRECY AS TOUCHING THE FORMER RELATION BETWIXT YOURSELF AND ME
SHE MADE LITTLE BOATS OUT OF BIRCH-BARK AND FREIGHTED THEM WITH SNAILSHELLS AND SENT OUT MORE VENTURES ON THE MIGHTY DEEP THAN ANY MERCHANT IN NEW ENGLAND
BE IT ACCEPTED AS A PROOF THAT ALL WAS NOT CORRUPT IN THIS POOR VICTIM OF HER OWN FRAILTY AND MAN'S HARD LAW THAT HESTER PRYNNE YET STRUGGLED TO BELIEVE THAT NO FELLOW-MORTAL WAS GUILTY LIKE HERSELF
SURELY IT WERE CHILD'S PLAY TO CALL IN A PHYSICIAN AND THEN HIDE THE SORE YOU WOULD TELL ME THEN THAT I KNOW ALL SAID ROGER CHILLINGWORTH DELIBERATELY AND FIXING AN EYE BRIGHT WITH INTENSE AND CONCENTRATED INTELLIGENCE ON THE MINISTER'S FACE
WITH AN EYE THAT SAW THROUGH ALL PERPLEXITIES AND A FACULTY OF ARRANGEMENT THAT MADE THEM VANISH AS BY THE WAVING OF AN ENCHANTER'S WAND
WITH A CHILL DESPONDENCY LIKE ONE AWAKENING ALL NERVELESS FROM AN UGLY DREAM HE YIELDED HIMSELF TO THE PHYSICIAN AND WAS LED AWAY
LOOK THOU TO IT
SOMETHING WHICH SHOULD REMIND HIM INDEED BUT ONLY BY CONTRAST OF THAT SACRED IMAGE OF SINLESS MOTHERHOOD WHOSE INFANT WAS TO REDEEM THE WORLD
IT WAS AS IF A NEW BIRTH WITH STRONGER ASSIMILATIONS THAN THE FIRST HAD CONVERTED THE FOREST-LAND STILL SO UNCONGENIAL TO EVERY OTHER PILGRIM AND WANDERER INTO HESTER PRYNNE'S WILD AND DREARY BUT LIFE-LONG HOME
CAST OFF THIS CHILD
OR WHETHER THEY ARE NOW GROANING UNDER THE HEAVY CONSEQUENCES OF THEM IN ANOTHER STATE OF BEING
FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE REASON AS ARTHUR DIMMESDALE FELT THE CHILD'S EYES UPON HIMSELF HIS HAND--WITH THAT GESTURE SO HABITUAL AS TO HAVE BECOME INVOLUNTARY--STOLE OVER HIS HEART
BUT AFTER A TORPID WINTER WOULD CREEP OUT INTO THE WARM SUNSHINE OF MAY OR JUNE GO LAZILY ABOUT WHAT THEY TERMED DUTY AND AT THEIR OWN LEISURE AND CONVENIENCE BETAKE THEMSELVES TO BED AGAIN
LIKE ALL OTHER TIES IT BROUGHT ALONG WITH IT ITS OBLIGATIONS
BELLINGHAM FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HAD KEPT AN ANXIOUS EYE UPON HIM
HE HAS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF ME
WILT THOU DIE FOR VERY WEAKNESS
NOR DID HIS DEMEANOUR CHANGE WHEN THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE PRISON KEEPER LEFT HIM FACE TO FACE WITH THE WOMAN WHOSE ABSORBED NOTICE OF HIM IN THE CROWD HAD INTIMATED SO CLOSE A RELATION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HER
BY SENDING YONDER DARK AND TERRIBLE OLD MAN TO KEEP THE TORTURE ALWAYS AT RED-HEAT
WE HAVE WRONGED EACH OTHER ANSWERED HE
AND--NOT TO FORGET THE LIBRARY--ON SOME SHELVES A SCORE OR TWO OF VOLUMES OF THE ACTS OF CONGRESS AND A BULKY DIGEST OF THE REVENUE LAWS
HE WAS LIKEWISE A BITTER PERSECUTOR
WHAT I CONTEND FOR IS THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE OUTLINE
IT WAS NONE THE LESS A FACT HOWEVER THAT IN THE EYES OF THE VERY MEN WHO SPOKE THUS THE SCARLET LETTER HAD THE EFFECT OF THE CROSS ON A NUN'S BOSOM
PEARL SEEING THE ROSE-BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
QUICKLY AND AS LOW AS THOU CANST WHISPER PEARL MUMBLED SOMETHING INTO HIS EAR THAT SOUNDED INDEED LIKE HUMAN LANGUAGE BUT WAS ONLY SUCH GIBBERISH AS CHILDREN MAY BE HEARD AMUSING THEMSELVES WITH BY THE HOUR TOGETHER
THEY WERE DOUBTLESS GOOD MEN JUST AND SAGE
SUCH SCENES HAD ONCE APPEARED NOT OTHERWISE THAN HAPPY BUT NOW AS VIEWED THROUGH THE DISMAL MEDIUM OF HER SUBSEQUENT LIFE THEY CLASSED THEMSELVES AMONG HER UGLIEST REMEMBRANCES
TO SPIRITUALISE THE BURDEN THAT BEGAN TO WEIGH SO HEAVILY
SHE NOW READ HIS HEART MORE ACCURATELY
WHAT IMAGINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IRREVERENT ENOUGH TO SURMISE THAT THE SAME SCORCHING STIGMA WAS ON THEM BOTH
THE DELL WAS TO BE LEFT IN SOLITUDE AMONG ITS DARK OLD TREES WHICH WITH THEIR MULTITUDINOUS TONGUES WOULD WHISPER LONG OF WHAT HAD PASSED THERE AND NO MORTAL BE THE WISER
WITH THE LAST WORDS OF GRANDFATHER'S CHAIR 1842
AT FIRST AS ALREADY TOLD SHE HAD FLIRTED FANCIFULLY WITH HER OWN IMAGE IN A POOL OF WATER BECKONING THE PHANTOM FORTH AND--AS IT DECLINED TO VENTURE--SEEKING A PASSAGE FOR HERSELF INTO ITS SPHERE OF IMPALPABLE EARTH AND UNATTAINABLE SKY
BUT HOW STRANGELY BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS WITH THOSE WILD FLOWERS IN HER HAIR
COME AND ASK HIS BLESSING BUT WHETHER INFLUENCED BY THE JEALOUSY THAT SEEMS INSTINCTIVE WITH EVERY PETTED CHILD TOWARDS A DANGEROUS RIVAL OR FROM WHATEVER CAPRICE OF HER FREAKISH NATURE PEARL WOULD SHOW NO FAVOUR TO THE CLERGYMAN
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE LATTER'S EXPRESSION THAT WARNED BACK THE MAGISTRATE ALTHOUGH A MAN NOT READILY OBEYING THE VAGUE INTIMATIONS THAT PASS FROM ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER
BUT SURELY HIS EXISTENCE HERE ADMITTING THAT IT WAS TO TERMINATE WITH HIS LAST BREATH HAD BEEN NOT UNKINDLY GIVEN
IN HIS INDIAN CAPTIVITY MOREOVER HE HAD GAINED MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPERTIES OF NATIVE HERBS AND ROOTS
AND IT IS EASY TO CONCLUDE FROM THE GENERAL SLOVENLINESS OF THE PLACE THAT THIS IS A SANCTUARY INTO WHICH WOMANKIND WITH HER TOOLS OF MAGIC THE BROOM AND MOP HAS VERY INFREQUENT ACCESS
HESTER FELT THAT THE SACRIFICE OF THE CLERGYMAN'S GOOD NAME AND DEATH ITSELF AS SHE HAD ALREADY TOLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WOULD HAVE BEEN INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN UPON HERSELF TO CHOOSE
HE HAD SLAIN MEN WITH HIS OWN HAND FOR AUGHT I KNOW--CERTAINLY THEY HAD FALLEN LIKE BLADES OF GRASS AT THE SWEEP OF THE SCYTHE BEFORE THE CHARGE TO WHICH HIS SPIRIT IMPARTED ITS TRIUMPHANT ENERGY--BUT BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THERE WAS NEVER IN HIS HEART SO MUCH CRUELTY AS WOULD HAVE BRUSHED THE DOWN OFF A BUTTERFLY'S WING
TO THE HOLY MINISTERS WHO WERE HIS BRETHREN
SO PEARL WHO HAD ENOUGH OF SHADOW IN HER OWN LITTLE LIFE CHOSE TO BREAK OFF ALL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS REPINING BROOK
CHARACTERISED BY A CERTAIN STATE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN BY THE DELICATE EVANESCENT AND INDESCRIBABLE GRACE WHICH IS NOW RECOGNISED AS ITS INDICATION
IT IS WITH AN EFFORT THAT I RECALL THE FIGURES AND APPELLATIONS OF THESE FEW
I HAD SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE NIGHT AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE WORSHIPFUL GOVERNOR WINTHROP DOING WHAT MY POOR SKILL MIGHT TO GIVE HIM EASE
TELL ME THEN WHAT THOU ART AND WHO SENT THEE HITHER TELL ME MOTHER SAID THE CHILD SERIOUSLY COMING UP TO HESTER AND PRESSING HERSELF CLOSE TO HER KNEES
NOW I CAN STRETCH OUT MY HAND AND GRASP SOME OF IT AS SHE ATTEMPTED TO DO SO THE SUNSHINE VANISHED
OF WHICH EVER SINCE HER BABYHOOD SHE HAD POSSESSED A SINGULAR VARIETY AND COULD TRANSFORM HER MOBILE PHYSIOGNOMY INTO A SERIES OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS WITH A NEW MISCHIEF IN THEM EACH AND ALL
LASTLY IN LIEU OF THESE SHIFTING SCENES CAME BACK THE RUDE MARKET-PLACE OF THE PURITAN SETTLEMENT WITH ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED AND LEVELLING THEIR STERN REGARDS AT HESTER PRYNNE--YES AT HERSELF--WHO STOOD ON THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY AN INFANT ON HER ARM AND THE LETTER A IN SCARLET FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD THREAD UPON HER BOSOM
ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THE THOUGHTS THAT HAD SEEMED SO VITAL AND SO ACTIVE YET HAD BEEN PUT TO REST SO QUIETLY REVIVED AGAIN
EVEN THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF HER PERSON HAD UNDERGONE A SIMILAR CHANGE
HE DID NOT SEND ME CRIED SHE POSITIVELY
BUT SEE MOTHER HOW MANY FACES OF STRANGE PEOPLE AND INDIANS AMONG THEM AND SAILORS
HE HAD TOLD HIS HEARERS THAT HE WAS ALTOGETHER VILE A VILER COMPANION OF THE VILEST THE WORST OF SINNERS AN ABOMINATION A THING OF UNIMAGINABLE INIQUITY AND THAT THE ONLY WONDER WAS THAT THEY DID NOT SEE HIS WRETCHED BODY SHRIVELLED UP BEFORE THEIR EYES BY THE BURNING WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY
BEHOLD VERILY THERE IS THE WOMAN OF THE SCARLET LETTER
HESTER PARTLY RAISED HIM AND SUPPORTED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BOSOM
UNSCRUPULOUS AS IT WAS HOWEVER IT COULD NOT BRING THEM NEARER THAN A CIRCUIT OF SEVERAL YARDS
BUT SELDOM OR NEVER ON THE OTHER HAND AFTER THE FIRST TWO GENERATIONS PERFORMING ANY MEMORABLE DEED OR SO MUCH AS PUTTING FORWARD A CLAIM TO PUBLIC NOTICE
BUT SHE FANCIED ME ASLEEP WHILE SHE WAS TALKING OF IT
HE KEPT VIGILS LIKEWISE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SOMETIMES IN UTTER DARKNESS SOMETIMES WITH A GLIMMERING LAMP AND SOMETIMES VIEWING HIS OWN FACE IN A LOOKING-GLASS BY THE MOST POWERFUL LIGHT WHICH HE COULD THROW UPON IT
WHILE HE DREW THE ONLY CHAIR WHICH THE ROOM AFFORDED AND TOOK HIS OWN SEAT BESIDE HER
HAST THOU NOT TORTURED HIM ENOUGH SAID HESTER NOTICING THE OLD MAN'S LOOK
HEREIN IS THE SINFUL MOTHER HAPPIER THAN THE SINFUL FATHER
FAR AND DEEP IN ITS OWN REGION BUSYING ITSELF WITH PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY TO MARSHAL A PROCESSION OF STATELY THOUGHTS THAT WERE SOON TO ISSUE THENCE
THE MEN OF RANK AND DIGNITY WHO STOOD MORE IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE CLERGYMAN WERE SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND SO PERPLEXED AS TO THE PURPORT OF WHAT THEY SAW--UNABLE TO RECEIVE THE EXPLANATION WHICH MOST READILY PRESENTED ITSELF OR TO IMAGINE ANY OTHER--THAT THEY REMAINED SILENT AND INACTIVE SPECTATORS OF THE JUDGEMENT WHICH PROVIDENCE SEEMED ABOUT TO WORK
MILITARY MEN WORE IT ON THEIR SCARFS AND THE MINISTER ON HIS BAND
GAZING AT PEARL HESTER PRYNNE OFTEN DROPPED HER WORK UPON HER KNEES AND CRIED OUT WITH AN AGONY WHICH SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE HIDDEN BUT WHICH MADE UTTERANCE FOR ITSELF BETWIXT SPEECH AND A GROAN--"O FATHER IN HEAVEN--IF THOU ART STILL MY FATHER--WHAT IS THIS BEING WHICH I HAVE BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD AND PEARL OVERHEARING THE EJACULATION OR AWARE THROUGH SOME MORE SUBTILE CHANNEL OF THOSE THROBS OF ANGUISH WOULD TURN HER VIVID AND BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FACE UPON HER MOTHER SMILE WITH SPRITE-LIKE INTELLIGENCE AND RESUME HER PLAY
IT IS THE UNSPEAKABLE MISERY OF A LIFE SO FALSE AS HIS THAT IT STEALS THE PITH AND SUBSTANCE OUT OF WHATEVER REALITIES THERE ARE AROUND US AND WHICH WERE MEANT BY HEAVEN TO BE THE SPIRIT'S JOY AND NUTRIMENT
AND LIKEWISE IN A NEWSPAPER OF RECENT TIMES AN ACCOUNT OF THE DIGGING UP OF HIS REMAINS IN THE LITTLE GRAVEYARD OF ST PETER'S CHURCH DURING THE RENEWAL OF THAT EDIFICE
FOR THOUGH BRED A LAWYER AND ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK OF BACON COKE NOYE AND FINCH AS HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS NEW COUNTRY HAD TRANSFORMED GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM INTO A SOLDIER AS WELL AS A STATESMAN AND RULER
ART THOU A CHRISTIAN CHILD--HA
HIS FIRST ENTRY ON THE SCENE FEW PEOPLE COULD TELL WHENCE DROPPING DOWN AS IT WERE OUT OF THE SKY OR STARTING FROM THE NETHER EARTH HAD AN ASPECT OF MYSTERY WHICH WAS EASILY HEIGHTENED TO THE MIRACULOUS
AND THEY GAZED WONDERINGLY AND ADMIRINGLY AT PEARL AS IF A FLAKE OF THE SEA-FOAM HAD TAKEN THE SHAPE OF A LITTLE MAID AND WERE GIFTED WITH A SOUL OF THE SEA-FIRE THAT FLASHES BENEATH THE PROW IN THE NIGHT-TIME
LET HIM DO WITH ME AS IN HIS JUSTICE AND WISDOM HE SHALL SEE GOOD
BUT HOW
THEIR VOICES CAME DOWN AFAR AND INDISTINCTLY FROM THE UPPER HEIGHTS WHERE THEY HABITUALLY DWELT
SHE STOOD APART FROM MORTAL INTERESTS YET CLOSE BESIDE THEM LIKE A GHOST THAT REVISITS THE FAMILIAR FIRESIDE AND CAN NO LONGER MAKE ITSELF SEEN OR FELT
LEAF AFTER LEAF PRESENTING ITSELF TO ME JUST AS IT WAS WRITTEN OUT BY THE REALITY OF THE FLITTING HOUR AND VANISHING AS FAST AS WRITTEN ONLY BECAUSE MY BRAIN WANTED THE INSIGHT AND MY HAND THE CUNNING TO TRANSCRIBE IT
IT WAS NO GREAT DISTANCE IN THOSE DAYS FROM THE PRISON DOOR TO THE MARKET-PLACE
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS HIGH NATIVE GIFTS AND SCHOLAR-LIKE ATTAINMENTS THERE WAS AN AIR ABOUT THIS YOUNG MINISTER--AN APPREHENSIVE A STARTLED A HALF-FRIGHTENED LOOK--AS OF A BEING WHO FELT HIMSELF QUITE ASTRAY AND AT A LOSS IN THE PATHWAY OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND COULD ONLY BE AT EASE IN SOME SECLUSION OF HIS OWN
HE MOVING PROUDLY PAST ENVELOPED AS IT WERE IN THE RICH MUSIC WITH THE PROCESSION OF MAJESTIC AND VENERABLE FATHERS
SHE ASSURED THEM TOO OF HER FIRM BELIEF THAT AT SOME BRIGHTER PERIOD WHEN THE WORLD SHOULD HAVE GROWN RIPE FOR IT IN HEAVEN'S OWN TIME A NEW TRUTH WOULD BE REVEALED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE WHOLE RELATION BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN ON A SURER GROUND OF MUTUAL HAPPINESS
DOST THOU KNOW ME SO LITTLE HESTER PRYNNE
COME UP HITHER I PRAY YOU AND PASS A PLEASANT HOUR WITH ME GOOD HEAVENS
NOTHING IF I RIGHTLY CALL TO MIND WAS LEFT OF MY RESPECTED PREDECESSOR SAVE AN IMPERFECT SKELETON AND SOME FRAGMENTS OF APPAREL AND A WIG OF MAJESTIC FRIZZLE WHICH UNLIKE THE HEAD THAT IT ONCE ADORNED WAS IN VERY SATISFACTORY PRESERVATION
HE WAS OFTEN OBSERVED ON ANY SLIGHT ALARM OR OTHER SUDDEN ACCIDENT TO PUT HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART WITH FIRST A FLUSH AND THEN A PALENESS INDICATIVE OF PAIN
AS THE REVEREND MR WILSON PASSED BESIDE THE SCAFFOLD CLOSELY MUFFLING HIS GENEVA CLOAK ABOUT HIM WITH ONE ARM AND HOLDING THE LANTERN BEFORE HIS BREAST WITH THE OTHER THE MINISTER COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN HIMSELF FROM SPEAKING A GOOD EVENING TO YOU VENERABLE FATHER WILSON
AND THE SKETCH WHICH I AM NOW BRINGING TO A CLOSE IF TOO AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL FOR A MODEST PERSON TO PUBLISH IN HIS LIFETIME WILL READILY BE EXCUSED IN A GENTLEMAN WHO WRITES FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
EARLIER IN LIFE HESTER HAD VAINLY IMAGINED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT BE THE DESTINED PROPHETESS BUT HAD LONG SINCE RECOGNISED THE IMPOSSIBILITY THAT ANY MISSION OF DIVINE AND MYSTERIOUS TRUTH SHOULD BE CONFIDED TO A WOMAN STAINED WITH SIN BOWED DOWN WITH SHAME OR EVEN BURDENED WITH A LIFE-LONG SORROW
THE DESTINY THAT HAD DRAWN AN INVIOLABLE CIRCLE ROUND ABOUT HER
WHY SHOULD NOT THE GUILTY ONES SOONER AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS UNUTTERABLE SOLACE THEY MOSTLY DO SAID THE CLERGYMAN GRIPING HARD AT HIS BREAST AS IF AFFLICTED WITH AN IMPORTUNATE THROB OF PAIN
AN OUTCRY THAT WENT PEALING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND WAS BEATEN BACK FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER AND REVERBERATED FROM THE HILLS IN THE BACKGROUND
THE SAME WAS TRUE AS REGARDED THE ACQUAINTANCES WHOM HE MET AND ALL THE WELL-KNOWN SHAPES OF HUMAN LIFE ABOUT THE LITTLE TOWN
WHAT LITTLE BIRD OF SCARLET PLUMAGE MAY THIS BE
I WHOM YOU BEHOLD IN THESE BLACK GARMENTS OF THE PRIESTHOOD--I WHO ASCEND THE SACRED DESK AND TURN MY PALE FACE HEAVENWARD TAKING UPON MYSELF TO HOLD COMMUNION IN YOUR BEHALF WITH THE MOST HIGH OMNISCIENCE--I IN WHOSE DAILY LIFE YOU DISCERN THE SANCTITY OF ENOCH--I WHOSE FOOTSTEPS AS YOU SUPPOSE LEAVE A GLEAM ALONG MY EARTHLY TRACK WHEREBY THE PILGRIMS THAT SHALL COME AFTER ME MAY BE GUIDED TO THE REGIONS OF THE BLEST--I WHO HAVE LAID THE HAND OF BAPTISM UPON YOUR CHILDREN--I WHO HAVE BREATHED THE PARTING PRAYER OVER YOUR DYING FRIENDS TO WHOM THE AMEN SOUNDED FAINTLY FROM A WORLD WHICH THEY HAD QUITTED--I YOUR PASTOR WHOM YOU SO REVERENCE AND TRUST AM UTTERLY A POLLUTION AND A LIE MORE THAN ONCE MR DIMMESDALE HAD GONE INTO THE PULPIT WITH A PURPOSE NEVER TO COME DOWN ITS STEPS UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN WORDS LIKE THE ABOVE
NEVER SINCE HER RELEASE FROM PRISON HAD HESTER MET THE PUBLIC GAZE WITHOUT HER
FRENCH AND ITALIAN NOTE BOOKS 1871
HESTER SAID HE COME HITHER
ALAS FOR HIS OWN SOUL IF THESE WERE WHAT HE SOUGHT
HESTER'S FIRST MOTION HAD BEEN TO COVER HER BOSOM WITH HER CLASPED HANDS
EACH FELT THE IMPULSE IN HIMSELF AND IN THE SAME BREATH CAUGHT IT FROM HIS NEIGHBOUR
PROVIDENCE IN THE PERSON OF THIS LITTLE GIRL HAD ASSIGNED TO HESTER'S CHARGE THE GERM AND BLOSSOM OF WOMANHOOD TO BE CHERISHED AND DEVELOPED AMID A HOST OF DIFFICULTIES
IF THE CHILD ON THE OTHER HAND WERE REALLY CAPABLE OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS GROWTH AND POSSESSED THE ELEMENTS OF ULTIMATE SALVATION THEN SURELY IT WOULD ENJOY ALL THE FAIRER PROSPECT OF THESE ADVANTAGES BY BEING TRANSFERRED TO WISER AND BETTER GUARDIANSHIP THAN HESTER PRYNNE'S
WHAT WE DID HAD A CONSECRATION OF ITS OWN
AND THEN A NATIVE RESERVE BEING THAWED BY THIS GENIAL CONSCIOUSNESS WE MAY PRATE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LIE AROUND US AND EVEN OF OURSELF BUT STILL KEEP THE INMOST ME BEHIND ITS VEIL
NOR IS IT THEIR CUSTOM IGNOMINIOUSLY TO KICK THE HEAD WHICH THEY HAVE JUST STRUCK OFF
THE RECOGNITION CHAPTER IV
I SAW HER THE OTHER DAY BESPATTER THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF WITH WATER AT THE CATTLE-TROUGH IN SPRING LANE
THE BRILLIANCY MIGHT HAVE BE FITTED ALADDIN'S PALACE RATHER THAN THE MANSION OF A GRAVE OLD PURITAN RULER
HOWEVER LEAVING THAT MYSTERY TO SOLVE ITSELF OR GO UNSOLVED FOR EVER HE DROVE HIS TASK ONWARD WITH EARNEST HASTE AND ECSTASY
THEREFORE ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE HE LOATHED HIS MISERABLE SELF
THERE WAS ONE THING THAT MUCH AIDED ME IN RENEWING AND RE-CREATING THE STALWART SOLDIER OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER--THE MAN OF TRUE AND SIMPLE ENERGY
IT IS ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO FORM A COMPLETE ESTIMATE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF OFFICIAL LIFE TO VIEW THE INCUMBENT AT THE IN-COMING OF A HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION
XXIII
P
P
I WILL CALL HER
THEY WOULD TAKE NEITHER THE GLOW OF PASSION NOR THE TENDERNESS OF SENTIMENT BUT RETAINED ALL THE RIGIDITY OF DEAD CORPSES AND STARED ME IN THE FACE WITH A FIXED AND GHASTLY GRIN OF CONTEMPTUOUS DEFIANCE
THAT THOU SHALT NEVER KNOW NEVER SAYEST THOU REJOINED HE WITH A SMILE OF DARK AND SELF-RELYING INTELLIGENCE
THE PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE IN THE MARKET-PLACE THOUGH ITS GENERAL TINT WAS THE SAD GRAY BROWN OR BLACK OF THE ENGLISH EMIGRANTS WAS YET ENLIVENED BY SOME DIVERSITY OF HUE
IT WAS THE EXHILARATING EFFECT--UPON A PRISONER JUST ESCAPED FROM THE DUNGEON OF HIS OWN HEART--OF BREATHING THE WILD FREE ATMOSPHERE OF AN UNREDEEMED UNCHRISTIANISED LAWLESS REGION
SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S VOICE AND APPROACHED SLOWLY THROUGH THE FOREST
AND WOULD THAT I MIGHT ENDURE HIS AGONY AS WELL AS MINE SPEAK WOMAN SAID ANOTHER VOICE COLDLY AND STERNLY PROCEEDING FROM THE CROWD ABOUT THE SCAFFOLD SPEAK
HESTER AND PEARL CHAPTER XVI
IT WAS MY FOLLY AND THY WEAKNESS
IT BORE A DEVICE A HERALD'S WORDING OF WHICH MAY SERVE FOR A MOTTO AND BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OUR NOW CONCLUDED LEGEND
ONE BRIEF SIGH SUFFICED TO CARRY OFF THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF THESE DISMAL REMINISCENCES
AND YET BY THE CONSTITUTION OF HIS NATURE HE LOVED THE TRUTH AND LOATHED THE LIE AS FEW MEN EVER DID
YET HAD LITTLE PEARL NEVER COME TO HER FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FAR OTHERWISE
AND THERE IS MASTER BRACKETT THE OLD JAILER NODDING AND SMILING AT ME
THE GREATER PART OF MY OFFICERS WERE WHIGS
A STRANGE SAD MAN IS HE WITH HIS HAND ALWAYS OVER HIS HEART BE QUIET PEARL--THOU UNDERSTANDEST NOT THESE THINGS SAID HER MOTHER
MARRY GOOD SIR IN SOME TWO YEARS OR LESS THAT THE WOMAN HAS BEEN A DWELLER HERE IN BOSTON NO TIDINGS HAVE COME OF THIS LEARNED GENTLEMAN MASTER PRYNNE
I FEAR
I FEAR
HIS SPIRIT COULD NEVER I CONCEIVE HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY AN UNEASY ACTIVITY
FOR THE BRIEF SPACE THAT IT LASTED IT WAS A DARK TRANSFIGURATION
SO LET ME MAKE HASTE TO TAKE MY SHAME UPON ME PARTLY SUPPORTED BY HESTER PRYNNE AND HOLDING ONE HAND OF LITTLE PEARL'S THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE TURNED TO THE DIGNIFIED AND VENERABLE RULERS
I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN SIDE BY SIDE AND HAND CLASPED IN HAND ON THE MOSSY TRUNK OF THE FALLEN TREE
THE LETTER WAS THE SYMBOL OF HER CALLING
ELSEWHERE THE TOKEN OF SIN IT WAS THE TAPER OF THE SICK CHAMBER
I COULD ACCOUNT FOR THEIR BEING INCLUDED IN THE HEAP OF CUSTOM-HOUSE LUMBER ONLY BY THE FACT THAT MR PUE'S DEATH HAD HAPPENED SUDDENLY AND THAT THESE PAPERS WHICH HE PROBABLY KEPT IN HIS OFFICIAL DESK HAD NEVER COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS HEIRS OR WERE SUPPOSED TO RELATE TO THE BUSINESS OF THE REVENUE
MOST OF THE SPECTATORS TESTIFIED TO HAVING SEEN ON THE BREAST OF THE UNHAPPY MINISTER A SCARLET LETTER--THE VERY SEMBLANCE OF THAT WORN BY HESTER PRYNNE--IMPRINTED IN THE FLESH
WE IMPUTE IT THEREFORE SOLELY TO THE DISEASE IN HIS OWN EYE AND HEART THAT THE MINISTER LOOKING UPWARD TO THE ZENITH BEHELD THERE THE APPEARANCE OF AN IMMENSE LETTER--THE LETTER A--MARKED OUT IN LINES OF DULL RED LIGHT
IF HER HEART CHANCE TO COME UPPERMOST THEY VANISH
AT ANOTHER WINDOW OF THE SAME HOUSE MOREOVER APPEARED OLD MISTRESS HIBBINS THE GOVERNOR'S SISTER ALSO WITH A LAMP WHICH EVEN THUS FAR OFF REVEALED THE EXPRESSION OF HER SOUR AND DISCONTENTED FACE
THE CENTRE-TABLE SUSTAINING A WORK-BASKET A VOLUME OR TWO AND AN EXTINGUISHED LAMP
IN HER LONESOME COTTAGE BY THE SEASHORE THOUGHTS VISITED HER SUCH AS DARED TO ENTER NO OTHER DWELLING IN NEW ENGLAND
THE WORLD'S LAW WAS NO LAW FOR HER MIND
IT NOW WRITHED IN CONVULSIONS OF PAIN AND WAS A FORCIBLE TYPE IN ITS LITTLE FRAME OF THE MORAL AGONY WHICH HESTER PRYNNE HAD BORNE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
TO SUCH A PROFESSIONAL BODY ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WAS A BRILLIANT ACQUISITION
HE HAS DONE ME WORSE WRONG THAN I DID HIM LET MEN TREMBLE TO WIN THE HAND OF WOMAN UNLESS THEY WIN ALONG WITH IT THE UTMOST PASSION OF HER HEART
WILT THOU YET FORGIVE ME SHE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THERE THOU ART FREE
IT WAS A LITTLE DELL WHERE THEY HAD SEATED THEMSELVES WITH A LEAF-STREWN BANK RISING GENTLY ON EITHER SIDE AND A BROOK FLOWING THROUGH THE MIDST OVER A BED OF FALLEN AND DROWNED LEAVES
HERE HE HAD STUDIED AND WRITTEN
SHE WANTED--WHAT SOME PEOPLE WANT THROUGHOUT LIFE--A GRIEF THAT SHOULD DEEPLY TOUCH HER AND THUS HUMANISE AND MAKE HER CAPABLE OF SYMPATHY
DOING HIS BEST FOR HIM IN ALL GOOD FAITH BUT ALWAYS QUITTING THE PATIENT'S APARTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEW WITH A MYSTERIOUS AND PUZZLED SMILE UPON HIS LIPS
UNKNOWN TO ALL BUT HESTER PRYNNE AND POSSESSING THE LOCK AND KEY OF HER SILENCE HE CHOSE TO WITHDRAW HIS NAME FROM THE ROLL OF MANKIND AND AS REGARDED HIS FORMER TIES AND INTEREST TO VANISH OUT OF LIFE AS COMPLETELY AS IF HE INDEED LAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN WHITHER RUMOUR HAD LONG AGO CONSIGNED HIM
SPEAK THOU FOR ME CRIED SHE
SOON THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION SHOWED ITSELF WITH A SLOW AND STATELY MARCH TURNING A CORNER AND MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE MARKET-PLACE
WERE I WORTHY TO BE QUIT OF IT IT WOULD FALL AWAY OF ITS OWN NATURE OR BE TRANSFORMED INTO SOMETHING THAT SHOULD SPEAK A DIFFERENT PURPORT NAY THEN WEAR IT IF IT SUIT YOU BETTER REJOINED HE A WOMAN MUST NEEDS FOLLOW HER OWN FANCY TOUCHING THE ADORNMENT OF HER PERSON
ITS COOL STARE OF FAMILIARITY WAS INTOLERABLE
THE FIRST TIME--THOU KNOWEST IT WELL
BUT HE OPPOSES TO ME--WITH A YOUNG MAN'S OVER-SOFTNESS ALBEIT WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS--THAT IT WERE WRONGING THE VERY NATURE OF WOMAN TO FORCE HER TO LAY OPEN HER HEART'S SECRETS IN SUCH BROAD DAYLIGHT AND IN PRESENCE OF SO GREAT A MULTITUDE
HE SANK DOWN ON THE GROUND AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
BUT PEARL'S LAUGH WHEN SHE WAS CAUGHT THOUGH FULL OF MERRIMENT AND MUSIC MADE HER MOTHER MORE DOUBTFUL THAN BEFORE
THE WITNESSES OF HESTER PRYNNE'S DISGRACE HAD NOT YET PASSED BEYOND THEIR SIMPLICITY
THIS EARTHLY FAINTNESS WAS IN THEIR VIEW ONLY ANOTHER PHASE OF THE MINISTER'S CELESTIAL STRENGTH
IT HAD BEEN INTENDED THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AS AN ORNAMENTAL ARTICLE OF DRESS
THIS--THOUGH DOUBTLESS IT MIGHT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL FORCE AND VOLUME FROM THE CHILD-LIKE LOYALTY WHICH THE AGE AWARDED TO ITS RULERS--WAS FELT TO BE AN IRREPRESSIBLE OUTBURST OF ENTHUSIASM KINDLED IN THE AUDITORS BY THAT HIGH STRAIN OF ELOQUENCE WHICH WAS YET REVERBERATING IN THEIR EARS
THE HIGH ESTIMATION THEN PLACED UPON THE MILITARY CHARACTER MIGHT BE SEEN IN THE LOFTY PORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MEMBER OF THE COMPANY
BUT DID YOUR REVERENCE HEAR OF THE PORTENT THAT WAS SEEN LAST NIGHT
HERE HER SORROW
FOR IT WAS OFTEN THE CASE THAT A SPORTIVE IMPULSE CAME OVER HER IN THE MIDST OF HER DEEPEST SUFFERING
BETTER
WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE GLIMMERING LANTERN HAD FADED QUITE AWAY THE MINISTER DISCOVERED BY THE FAINTNESS WHICH CAME OVER HIM THAT THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HAD BEEN A CRISIS OF TERRIBLE ANXIETY ALTHOUGH HIS MIND HAD MADE AN INVOLUNTARY EFFORT TO RELIEVE ITSELF BY A KIND OF LURID PLAYFULNESS
AND THOU SHALT SIT UPON HIS KNEE
THUS A BLAZING SPEAR A SWORD OF FLAME A BOW OR A SHEAF OF ARROWS SEEN IN THE MIDNIGHT SKY PREFIGURED INDIAN WARFARE
AS SHE DREW NIGH THE ARCH-FIEND WHISPERED HIM TO CONDENSE INTO SMALL COMPASS AND DROP INTO HER TENDER BOSOM A GERM OF EVIL THAT WOULD BE SURE TO BLOSSOM DARKLY SOON AND BEAR BLACK FRUIT BETIMES
THE MINISTER'S VIGIL CHAPTER XIII
HA HESTER PRYNNE WHAT IS IT GOOD MISTRESS HIBBINS EAGERLY ASKED LITTLE PEARL
MINE BURNS IN SECRET
WHICH DULY MINGLED WITH A FAIR PROPORTION OF DOCTRINAL INGREDIENT CONSTITUTES A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE EFFICACIOUS AND UNAMIABLE VARIETY OF THE CLERICAL SPECIES
SO THOU THINKEST THE CHILD WILL LOVE ME HESTER SMILED AND AGAIN CALLED TO PEARL WHO WAS VISIBLE AT SOME DISTANCE AS THE MINISTER HAD DESCRIBED HER LIKE A BRIGHT-APPARELLED VISION IN A SUNBEAM WHICH FELL DOWN UPON HER THROUGH AN ARCH OF BOUGHS
HEART-SMITTEN AT THIS BEWILDERING AND BAFFLING SPELL THAT SO OFTEN CAME BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER SOLE TREASURE WHOM SHE HAD BOUGHT SO DEAR AND WHO WAS ALL HER WORLD HESTER SOMETIMES BURST INTO PASSIONATE TEARS
BUT HE CLASPED BOTH HIS HANDS OVER HIS BREAST AND CAST HIS EYES TOWARDS THE ZENITH
SYMBOLISING IT WOULD SEEM NOT THE POWER OF SPEECH IN FOREIGN AND UNKNOWN LANGUAGES BUT THAT OF ADDRESSING THE WHOLE HUMAN BROTHERHOOD IN THE HEART'S NATIVE LANGUAGE
THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER THE ELOQUENT VOICE ON WHICH THE SOULS OF THE LISTENING AUDIENCE HAD BEEN BORNE ALOFT AS ON THE SWELLING WAVES OF THE SEA AT LENGTH CAME TO A PAUSE
IT WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE NOTED ON THE SUMMER MORNING WHEN OUR STORY BEGINS ITS COURSE THAT THE WOMEN OF WHOM THERE WERE SEVERAL IN THE CROWD APPEARED TO TAKE A PECULIAR INTEREST IN WHATEVER PENAL INFLICTION MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO ENSUE
NOT THE LESS HOWEVER CAME THIS IMPORTUNATELY OBTRUSIVE SENSE OF CHANGE
THERE MIGHT BE A MOMENT'S PEACE IN IT
NONE OF THESE VISIONS EVER QUITE DELUDED HIM
FOR HER KINDRED SHOULD THE TIDINGS EVER REACH THEM AND FOR THE COMPANIONS OF HER UNSPOTTED LIFE THERE REMAINED NOTHING BUT THE CONTAGION OF HER DISHONOUR
WHOM BUT THE REVEREND ARTHUR DIMMESDALE HALF-FROZEN TO DEATH OVERWHELMED WITH SHAME AND STANDING WHERE HESTER PRYNNE HAD STOOD
AND ONCE HESTER WAS SEEN EMBROIDERING A BABY-GARMENT WITH SUCH A LAVISH RICHNESS OF GOLDEN FANCY AS WOULD HAVE RAISED A PUBLIC TUMULT HAD ANY INFANT THUS APPARELLED BEEN SHOWN TO OUR SOBER-HUED COMMUNITY
I SEE HE ADDED
OH ARTHUR CRIED SHE FORGIVE ME
WAS I NOT ALL THIS ALL THIS AND MORE SAID HESTER
THIS MORBID MEDDLING OF CONSCIENCE WITH AN IMMATERIAL MATTER BETOKENED IT IS TO BE FEARED NO GENUINE AND STEADFAST PENITENCE BUT SOMETHING DOUBTFUL SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE DEEPLY WRONG BENEATH
BETTER HAD HE DIED AT ONCE
THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE NOTED ALL THESE MINUTE PARTICULARS EVEN WHILE FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT THE DOOM OF HIS EXISTENCE WAS STEALING ONWARD IN THE FOOTSTEPS WHICH HE NOW HEARD
ITS INFLUENCE COULD BE SEEN AS IT WERE DESCENDING UPON HIM AND POSSESSING HIM AND CONTINUALLY LIFTING HIM OUT OF THE WRITTEN DISCOURSE THAT LAY BEFORE HIM AND FILLING HIM WITH IDEAS THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AS MARVELLOUS TO HIMSELF AS TO HIS AUDIENCE
SHE ACCOMPANIED THIS WILD OUTBREAK WITH PIERCING SHRIEKS WHICH THE WOODS REVERBERATED ON ALL SIDES SO THAT ALONE AS SHE WAS IN HER CHILDISH AND UNREASONABLE WRATH IT SEEMED AS IF A HIDDEN MULTITUDE WERE LENDING HER THEIR SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGEMENT
THIS HE REPRESSED AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE AND STROVE TO LOOK AS IF NOTHING OF THE KIND HAD HAPPENED
IT IS AS IF ONE OF THE FAIRIES WHOM WE LEFT IN DEAR OLD ENGLAND HAD DECKED HER OUT TO MEET US IT WAS WITH A FEELING WHICH NEITHER OF THEM HAD EVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THAT THEY SAT AND WATCHED PEARL'S SLOW ADVANCE
WHILE OCCUPIED WITH THESE REFLECTIONS A KNOCK CAME AT THE DOOR OF THE STUDY AND THE MINISTER SAID COME IN!"--NOT WHOLLY DEVOID OF AN IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BEHOLD AN EVIL SPIRIT
THE EXCEPTION INDICATED THE EVER RELENTLESS VIGOUR WITH WHICH SOCIETY FROWNED UPON HER SIN
BUT WHO CAN SEE AN INCH INTO FUTURITY BEYOND HIS NOSE
BEHOLD A DREADFUL WITNESS OF IT WITH A CONVULSIVE MOTION HE TORE AWAY THE MINISTERIAL BAND FROM BEFORE HIS BREAST
WITHOUT A WORD MORE SPOKEN--NEITHER HE NOR SHE ASSUMING THE GUIDANCE BUT WITH AN UNEXPRESSED CONSENT--THEY GLIDED BACK INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WOODS WHENCE HESTER HAD EMERGED AND SAT DOWN ON THE HEAP OF MOSS WHERE SHE AND PEARL HAD BEFORE BEEN SITTING
MEANWHILE HESTER PRYNNE WAS STANDING BESIDE THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY WITH THE SCARLET LETTER STILL BURNING ON HER BREAST
HATH SHE ANY DISCOVERABLE PRINCIPLE OF BEING NONE SAVE THE FREEDOM OF A BROKEN LAW ANSWERED MR DIMMESDALE IN A QUIET WAY AS IF HE HAD BEEN DISCUSSING THE POINT WITHIN HIMSELF WHETHER CAPABLE OF GOOD I KNOW NOT THE CHILD PROBABLY OVERHEARD THEIR VOICES FOR LOOKING UP TO THE WINDOW WITH A BRIGHT BUT NAUGHTY SMILE OF MIRTH AND INTELLIGENCE SHE THREW ONE OF THE PRICKLY BURRS AT THE REV
WELL WELL INDEED
SHE WAS PATIENT--A MARTYR INDEED BUT SHE FOREBORE TO PRAY FOR ENEMIES LEST IN SPITE OF HER FORGIVING ASPIRATIONS THE WORDS OF THE BLESSING SHOULD STUBBORNLY TWIST THEMSELVES INTO A CURSE
AND AS FOR THE RED LETTER WHICH SHE HATH STITCHED SO CURIOUSLY I'LL BESTOW A RAG OF MINE OWN RHEUMATIC FLANNEL TO MAKE A FITTER ONE OH PEACE NEIGHBOURS--PEACE WHISPERED THEIR YOUNGEST COMPANION
THERE GOES A WOMAN RESUMED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AFTER A PAUSE WHO BE HER DEMERITS WHAT THEY MAY HATH NONE OF THAT MYSTERY OF HIDDEN SINFULNESS WHICH YOU DEEM SO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
AND IT SEEMED A FOULER OFFENCE COMMITTED BY ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THAN ANY WHICH HAD SINCE BEEN DONE HIM THAT IN THE TIME WHEN HER HEART KNEW NO BETTER HE HAD PERSUADED HER TO FANCY HERSELF HAPPY BY HIS SIDE
ATLANTIC MONTHLY 1860-1872 SCENES FROM THE DOLLIVER ROMANCE SEPTIMIUS FELTON AND PASSAGES FROM HAWTHORNE'S NOTE-BOOKS WORKS
THE FURNITURE OF THE HALL CONSISTED OF SOME PONDEROUS CHAIRS THE BACKS OF WHICH WERE ELABORATELY CARVED WITH WREATHS OF OAKEN FLOWERS
HER SIN HER IGNOMINY WERE THE ROOTS WHICH SHE HAD STRUCK INTO THE SOIL
IN SUCH LIFE AS HAS BEEN MINE THESE SEVEN YEARS PAST
HE HAS VIOLATED IN COLD BLOOD THE SANCTITY OF A HUMAN HEART
SOME AUTHORS INDEED DO FAR MORE THAN THIS AND INDULGE THEMSELVES IN SUCH CONFIDENTIAL DEPTHS OF REVELATION AS COULD FITTINGLY BE ADDRESSED ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ONE HEART AND MIND OF PERFECT SYMPATHY
THY MOTHER IS YONDER WOMAN WITH THE SCARLET LETTER SAID THE SEAMAN WILT THOU CARRY HER A MESSAGE FROM ME IF THE MESSAGE PLEASES ME I WILL ANSWERED PEARL
IT WAS THE ART THEN AS NOW ALMOST THE ONLY ONE WITHIN A WOMAN'S GRASP--OF NEEDLE-WORK
NOR WILD AS WERE THESE PAINTED BARBARIANS WERE THEY THE WILDEST FEATURE OF THE SCENE
IT IRKS ME NEVERTHELESS THAT THE PARTNER OF HER INIQUITY SHOULD NOT AT LEAST STAND ON THE SCAFFOLD BY HER SIDE
ARE YOU THERE YES
HERE IS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO MUST BE THY FRIEND ALSO
MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER ON ASCENDING THE STEPS YOU WOULD DISCERN IN THE ENTRY IF IT WERE SUMMER TIME OR IN THEIR APPROPRIATE ROOMS IF WINTRY OR INCLEMENT WEATHERS--A ROW OF VENERABLE FIGURES SITTING IN OLD-FASHIONED CHAIRS WHICH WERE TIPPED ON THEIR HIND LEGS BACK AGAINST THE WALL
THESE PRIMITIVE STATESMEN THEREFORE--BRADSTREET ENDICOTT DUDLEY BELLINGHAM AND THEIR COMPEERS--WHO WERE ELEVATED TO POWER BY THE EARLY CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN NOT OFTEN BRILLIANT BUT DISTINGUISHED BY A PONDEROUS SOBRIETY RATHER THAN ACTIVITY OF INTELLECT
AND WHAT AM I NOW DEMANDED HE LOOKING INTO HER FACE AND PERMITTING THE WHOLE EVIL WITHIN HIM TO BE WRITTEN ON HIS FEATURES
WOULD IT BE BEYOND A PHILOSOPHER'S RESEARCH THINK YE GENTLEMEN TO ANALYSE THAT CHILD'S NATURE AND FROM IT MAKE A MOULD TO GIVE A SHREWD GUESS AT THE FATHER NAY
GOOD MASTER WILSON I PRAY YOU EXAMINE THIS PEARL--SINCE THAT IS HER NAME--AND SEE WHETHER SHE HATH HAD SUCH CHRISTIAN NURTURE AS BEFITS A CHILD OF HER AGE THE OLD MINISTER SEATED HIMSELF IN AN ARM-CHAIR AND MADE AN EFFORT TO DRAW PEARL BETWIXT HIS KNEES
THE BELIEF WAS A FAVOURITE ONE WITH OUR FOREFATHERS AS BETOKENING THAT THEIR INFANT COMMONWEALTH WAS UNDER A CELESTIAL GUARDIANSHIP OF PECULIAR INTIMACY AND STRICTNESS
HERE IN A WORD--AND IT IS A RARE INSTANCE IN MY LIFE--I HAD MET WITH A PERSON THOROUGHLY ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION WHICH HE HELD
A CRIMSON FLUSH WAS GLOWING ON HER CHEEK THAT HAD BEEN LONG SO PALE
AND SOMETIMES ALSO BY A COARSER EXPRESSION THAT FELL UPON THE SUFFERER'S DEFENCELESS BREAST LIKE A ROUGH BLOW UPON AN ULCERATED WOUND
WHY WITH SUCH RANK IN THE LEARNED WORLD HAD HE COME HITHER
NOT SO MY LITTLE PEARL ANSWERED THE MINISTER
NEITHER AM I FIEND-LIKE WHO HAVE SNATCHED A FIEND'S OFFICE FROM HIS HANDS
OFTENTIMES THIS PROTESTANT AND PURITAN DIVINE HAD PLIED IT ON HIS OWN SHOULDERS LAUGHING BITTERLY AT HIMSELF THE WHILE AND SMITING SO MUCH THE MORE PITILESSLY BECAUSE OF THAT BITTER LAUGH
AND YET IT STRANGELY INTERESTED ME
THE CHILD'S ATTIRE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS DISTINGUISHED BY A FANCIFUL OR WE MAY RATHER SAY A FANTASTIC INGENUITY WHICH SERVED INDEED TO HEIGHTEN THE AIRY CHARM THAT EARLY BEGAN TO DEVELOP ITSELF IN THE LITTLE GIRL BUT WHICH APPEARED TO HAVE ALSO A DEEPER MEANING
NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING UGLY AND EVIL IN HIS FACE WHICH THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY NOTICED AND WHICH GREW STILL THE MORE OBVIOUS TO SIGHT THE OFTENER THEY LOOKED UPON HIM
THOU HAST ESCAPED ME MAY GOD FORGIVE THEE SAID THE MINISTER
AT TIMES THIS DEEP STRAIN OF PATHOS WAS ALL THAT COULD BE HEARD AND SCARCELY HEARD SIGHING AMID A DESOLATE SILENCE
I MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO THE CHARGE OF ABBREVIATING THE OFFICIAL BREATH OF MORE THAN ONE OF THESE VENERABLE SERVANTS OF THE REPUBLIC
SHE DETERMINED TO REDEEM HER ERROR SO FAR AS IT MIGHT YET BE POSSIBLE
INDIVIDUALS IN PRIVATE LIFE MEANWHILE HAD QUITE FORGIVEN HESTER PRYNNE FOR HER FRAILTY
IF SAGES WERE EVER WISE IN THEIR OWN BEHOOF I MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN ALL THIS
BUT THERE WAS HESTER CLAD IN HER GRAY ROBE STILL STANDING BESIDE THE TREE-TRUNK WHICH SOME BLAST HAD OVERTHROWN A LONG ANTIQUITY AGO AND WHICH TIME HAD EVER SINCE BEEN COVERING WITH MOSS SO THAT THESE TWO FATED ONES WITH EARTH'S HEAVIEST BURDEN ON THEM MIGHT THERE SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND FIND A SINGLE HOUR'S REST AND SOLACE
AND A PUMPKIN-VINE ROOTED AT SOME DISTANCE HAD RUN ACROSS THE INTERVENING SPACE AND DEPOSITED ONE OF ITS GIGANTIC PRODUCTS DIRECTLY BENEATH THE HALL WINDOW AS IF TO WARN THE GOVERNOR THAT THIS GREAT LUMP OF VEGETABLE GOLD WAS AS RICH AN ORNAMENT AS NEW ENGLAND EARTH WOULD OFFER HIM
HER MOTHER'S TOO WITH THE LOOK OF HEEDFUL AND ANXIOUS LOVE WHICH IT ALWAYS WORE IN HER REMEMBRANCE AND WHICH EVEN SINCE HER DEATH HAD SO OFTEN LAID THE IMPEDIMENT OF A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE IN HER DAUGHTER'S PATHWAY
EVEN IN OUTWARD DEMEANOUR THEY SHOWED A STAMP OF MAJESTY THAT MADE THE WARRIOR'S HAUGHTY STRIDE LOOK VULGAR IF NOT ABSURD
YES IF THOU TELLEST ME ALL ANSWERED PEARL
THE REASON IS NOT FAR TO SEEK
WHERE ASKED HE WITH A LOOK ASKANCE AT THEM--FOR IT WAS THE CLERGYMAN'S PECULIARITY THAT HE SELDOM NOW-A-DAYS LOOKED STRAIGHT FORTH AT ANY OBJECT WHETHER HUMAN OR INANIMATE WHERE MY KIND DOCTOR DID YOU GATHER THOSE HERBS WITH SUCH A DARK FLABBY LEAF EVEN IN THE GRAVEYARD HERE AT HAND ANSWERED THE PHYSICIAN CONTINUING HIS EMPLOYMENT
THIS VOCAL ORGAN WAS IN ITSELF A RICH ENDOWMENT INSOMUCH THAT A LISTENER COMPREHENDING NOTHING OF THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE PREACHER SPOKE MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN SWAYED TO AND FRO BY THE MERE TONE AND CADENCE
THE MERCHANTS VALUED HIM NOT LESS THAN WE HIS ESOTERIC FRIENDS
TWO OR THREE INDIVIDUALS HINTED THAT THE MAN OF SKILL DURING HIS INDIAN CAPTIVITY HAD ENLARGED HIS MEDICAL ATTAINMENTS BY JOINING IN THE INCANTATIONS OF THE SAVAGE PRIESTS WHO WERE UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE POWERFUL ENCHANTERS OFTEN PERFORMING SEEMINGLY MIRACULOUS CURES BY THEIR SKILL IN THE BLACK ART
HE WORE A DARK FEATHER IN HIS HAT A BORDER OF EMBROIDERY ON HIS CLOAK AND A BLACK VELVET TUNIC BENEATH--A GENTLEMAN ADVANCED IN YEARS WITH A HARD EXPERIENCE WRITTEN IN HIS WRINKLES
YES I HATE HIM REPEATED HESTER MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE
SHE IS A SPLENDID CHILD
THE VERY CONTIGUITY OF HIS ENEMY BENEATH WHATEVER MASK THE LATTER MIGHT CONCEAL HIMSELF WAS ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE MAGNETIC SPHERE OF A BEING SO SENSITIVE AS ARTHUR DIMMESDALE
ALL PEOPLE IN A WORD WOULD COME STUMBLING OVER THEIR THRESHOLDS AND TURNING UP THEIR AMAZED AND HORROR-STRICKEN VISAGES AROUND THE SCAFFOLD
I NEED NO MEDICINE SAID HE
BUT THERE IS STILL THE RUINED WALL AND NEAR IT THE STEALTHY TREAD OF THE FOE THAT WOULD WIN OVER AGAIN HIS UNFORGOTTEN TRIUMPH
HAST THOU EXHAUSTED POSSIBILITY IN THE FAILURE OF THIS ONE TRIAL
EVEN THUS MUCH OF TRUTH WOULD SAVE ME
OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH FOLLOWED AS ONE INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE DRAMA OF GUILT AND SORROW IN WHICH THEY HAD ALL BEEN ACTORS AND WELL ENTITLED THEREFORE TO BE PRESENT AT ITS CLOSING SCENE
BUT IN THEIR GREAT MERCY AND TENDERNESS OF HEART THEY HAVE DOOMED MISTRESS PRYNNE TO STAND ONLY A SPACE OF THREE HOURS ON THE PLATFORM OF THE PILLORY AND THEN AND THEREAFTER FOR THE REMAINDER OF HER NATURAL LIFE TO WEAR A MARK OF SHAME UPON HER BOSOM A WISE SENTENCE REMARKED THE STRANGER GRAVELY BOWING HIS HEAD
IN REPLY TO HER MOTHER'S COMMAND AND ENTREATY THAT SHE WOULD BEHAVE MORE DECOROUSLY LITTLE PEARL PAUSED TO GATHER THE PRICKLY BURRS FROM A TALL BURDOCK WHICH GREW BESIDE THE TOMB
A RARE CASE HE MUTTERED
YET FEAR NOT FOR HIM
MY FINGER POINTED AT THIS MAN WOULD HAVE HURLED HIM FROM HIS PULPIT INTO A DUNGEON THENCE PERADVENTURE TO THE GALLOWS IT HAD BEEN BETTER SO SAID HESTER PRYNNE
LETTERS CAME WITH ARMORIAL SEALS UPON THEM THOUGH OF BEARINGS UNKNOWN TO ENGLISH HERALDRY
YOU DEAL NOT I TAKE IT IN MEDICINE FOR THE SOUL THUS A SICKNESS CONTINUED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH GOING ON IN AN UNALTERED TONE WITHOUT HEEDING THE INTERRUPTION BUT STANDING UP AND CONFRONTING THE EMACIATED AND WHITE-CHEEKED MINISTER WITH HIS LOW DARK AND MISSHAPEN FIGURE,--"A SICKNESS A SORE PLACE IF WE MAY SO CALL IT IN YOUR SPIRIT HATH IMMEDIATELY ITS APPROPRIATE MANIFESTATION IN YOUR BODILY FRAME
THOU WAST MY PASTOR AND HADST CHARGE OF MY SOUL AND KNOWEST ME BETTER THAN THESE MEN CAN
LITTLE PEARL'S UNWONTED MOOD OF SENTIMENT LASTED NO LONGER
AT LAST HER SHOT BEING ALL EXPENDED THE CHILD STOOD STILL AND GAZED AT HESTER WITH THAT LITTLE LAUGHING IMAGE OF A FIEND PEEPING OUT--OR WHETHER IT PEEPED OR NO HER MOTHER SO IMAGINED IT--FROM THE UNSEARCHABLE ABYSS OF HER BLACK EYES
OH FOOLISH AND TIRESOME LITTLE BROOK CRIED PEARL AFTER LISTENING AWHILE TO ITS TALK WHY ART THOU SO SAD
HERE SEEN ONLY BY HER EYES ARTHUR DIMMESDALE FALSE TO GOD AND MAN MIGHT BE FOR ONE MOMENT TRUE
AND THOU ARTHUR DIMMESDALE DOST THOU YET LIVE IT WAS NO WONDER THAT THEY THUS QUESTIONED ONE ANOTHER'S ACTUAL AND BODILY EXISTENCE AND EVEN DOUBTED OF THEIR OWN
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT QUICKENED AN INSTINCTIVE CURIOSITY AND MADE ME UNDO THE FADED RED TAPE THAT TIED UP THE PACKAGE WITH THE SENSE THAT A TREASURE WOULD HERE BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT
WITHOUT ANY EFFORT OF HIS WILL OR POWER TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF HE SHRIEKED ALOUD
WHEN THE YOUNG WOMAN--THE MOTHER OF THIS CHILD--STOOD FULLY REVEALED BEFORE THE CROWD IT SEEMED TO BE HER FIRST IMPULSE TO CLASP THE INFANT CLOSELY TO HER BOSOM
NOT THE LESS HE IS MINE RESUMED HE WITH A LOOK OF CONFIDENCE AS IF DESTINY WERE AT ONE WITH HIM
NEVER AFTERWARDS DID IT QUIT HER BOSOM
BUT ENOUGH
WHEN THE BLACK MAN SEES ONE OF HIS OWN SERVANTS SIGNED AND SEALED SO SHY OF OWNING TO THE BOND AS IS THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE HE HATH A WAY OF ORDERING MATTERS SO THAT THE MARK SHALL BE DISCLOSED IN OPEN DAYLIGHT TO THE EYES OF ALL THE WORLD
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS IN LIFE--WHAT MODE OF GLORIFYING GOD OR BEING SERVICEABLE TO MANKIND IN HIS DAY AND GENERATION--MAY THAT BE
THE MINISTER HAD INQUIRED OF HESTER WITH NO LITTLE INTEREST THE PRECISE TIME AT WHICH THE VESSEL MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO DEPART
SHE SAID THAT A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD MET HIM HERE AND HAD WRITTEN IN HIS BOOK AND HAVE HIS MARK ON THEM
AS IF THE PRINTED BOOK THROWN AT LARGE ON THE WIDE WORLD WERE CERTAIN TO FIND OUT THE DIVIDED SEGMENT OF THE WRITER'S OWN NATURE AND COMPLETE HIS CIRCLE OF EXISTENCE BY BRINGING HIM INTO COMMUNION WITH IT
HESTER NEXT GATHERED UP THE HEAVY TRESSES OF HER HAIR AND CONFINED THEM BENEATH HER CAP
THE DOORSTEPS AND THRESHOLDS WITH THE EARLY GRASS SPRINGING UP ABOUT THEM
IT MAY BE FOR OTHER REASONS
TO MAKE HIMSELF THE ONE TRUSTED FRIEND TO WHOM SHOULD BE CONFIDED ALL THE FEAR THE REMORSE THE AGONY THE INEFFECTUAL REPENTANCE THE BACKWARD RUSH OF SINFUL THOUGHTS EXPELLED IN VAIN
THAT BETWEEN FLEEING AS AN AVOWED CRIMINAL AND REMAINING AS A HYPOCRITE CONSCIENCE MIGHT FIND IT HARD TO STRIKE THE BALANCE
OFTEN NEVERTHELESS MORE FROM CAPRICE THAN NECESSITY SHE DEMANDED TO BE TAKEN UP IN ARMS
THE MERCHANTS--PINGREE PHILLIPS SHEPARD UPTON KIMBALL BERTRAM HUNT--THESE AND MANY OTHER NAMES WHICH HAD SUCH CLASSIC FAMILIARITY FOR MY EAR SIX MONTHS AGO,--THESE MEN OF TRAFFIC WHO SEEMED TO OCCUPY SO IMPORTANT A POSITION IN THE WORLD--HOW LITTLE TIME HAS IT REQUIRED TO DISCONNECT ME FROM THEM ALL NOT MERELY IN ACT BUT RECOLLECTION
THE SOUL BEHELD ITS FEATURES IN THE MIRROR OF THE PASSING MOMENT
NEVERTHELESS THIS VERY SENTIMENT IS AN EVIDENCE THAT THE CONNEXION WHICH HAS BECOME AN UNHEALTHY ONE SHOULD AT LAST BE SEVERED
SOMETIMES THROUGH THAT ALCHEMY OF QUIET MALICE BY WHICH WOMEN CAN CONCOCT A SUBTLE POISON FROM ORDINARY TRIFLES
NOW IF NEVER BEFORE IT ANSWERED A GOOD PURPOSE BY ENABLING HESTER AND THE SEAMAN TO SPEAK TOGETHER WITHOUT RISK OF BEING OVERHEARD
THE WALLS WERE HUNG ROUND WITH TAPESTRY SAID TO BE FROM THE GOBELIN LOOMS AND AT ALL EVENTS REPRESENTING THE SCRIPTURAL STORY OF DAVID AND BATHSHEBA AND NATHAN THE PROPHET IN COLOURS STILL UNFADED BUT WHICH MADE THE FAIR WOMAN OF THE SCENE ALMOST AS GRIMLY PICTURESQUE AS THE WOE-DENOUNCING SEER
I WOULD SPEAK A WORD WITH YOU SAID SHE--"A WORD THAT CONCERNS US MUCH AHA
THIS SCARLET LETTER IS HIS MARK THUS CONVERSING THEY ENTERED SUFFICIENTLY DEEP INTO THE WOOD TO SECURE THEMSELVES FROM THE OBSERVATION OF ANY CASUAL PASSENGER ALONG THE FOREST TRACK
THERE WAS A LOOK OF PAIN IN HER FACE WHICH I WOULD GLADLY HAVE BEEN SPARED THE SIGHT OF
WHEREFORE NOT
THEN ALL WAS SPOKEN
HAD MR DIMMESDALE ACTUALLY SPOKEN
MEANWHILE THERE I WAS A SURVEYOR OF THE REVENUE AND SO FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AS GOOD A SURVEYOR AS NEED BE
MUST IT BE THOU OR I THAT SHALL DEAL WITH THIS POOR SINNER'S SOUL THERE WAS A MURMUR AMONG THE DIGNIFIED AND REVEREND OCCUPANTS OF THE BALCONY
IS NOT THIS BETTER MURMURED HE THAN WHAT WE DREAMED OF IN THE FOREST I KNOW NOT
BUT THE POINT WHICH DREW ALL EYES AND AS IT WERE TRANSFIGURED THE WEARER--SO THAT BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTED WITH HESTER PRYNNE WERE NOW IMPRESSED AS IF THEY BEHELD HER FOR THE FIRST TIME--WAS THAT SCARLET LETTER SO FANTASTICALLY EMBROIDERED AND ILLUMINATED UPON HER BOSOM
THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS AS READY FOR SPORT AS ANY UNBREECHED INFANT
WHERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH A CUSTOM THUS EARLY ESTABLISHED AND EVER SINCE OBSERVED THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE WAS TO DELIVER AN ELECTION SERMON
IT WAS WONDERFUL THE VAST VARIETY OF FORMS INTO WHICH SHE THREW HER INTELLECT WITH NO CONTINUITY INDEED BUT DARTING UP AND DANCING ALWAYS IN A STATE OF PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY--SOON SINKING DOWN AS IF EXHAUSTED BY SO RAPID AND FEVERISH A TIDE OF LIFE--AND SUCCEEDED BY OTHER SHAPES OF A SIMILAR WILD ENERGY
NOR HAVE I SO READ OR INTERPRETED HOLY WRIT AS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF HUMAN THOUGHTS AND DEEDS THEN TO BE MADE IS INTENDED AS A PART OF THE RETRIBUTION
HER OWN DRESS WAS OF THE COARSEST MATERIALS AND THE MOST SOMBRE HUE WITH ONLY THAT ONE ORNAMENT--THE SCARLET LETTER--WHICH IT WAS HER DOOM TO WEAR
MOTHER SAID LITTLE PEARL THE SUNSHINE DOES NOT LOVE YOU
I MUST TARRY AT HOME AND KEEP WATCH OVER MY LITTLE PEARL
IT MIGHT BE TRUE INDEED THAT THIS WAS A LIFE WHICH COULD NOT WITH IMPUNITY BE LIVED TOO LONG
THE SMALL DENIZENS OF THE WILDERNESS HARDLY TOOK PAINS TO MOVE OUT OF HER PATH
STANDING ON THAT MISERABLE EMINENCE SHE SAW AGAIN HER NATIVE VILLAGE IN OLD ENGLAND AND HER PATERNAL HOME
SHE IS MY HAPPINESS--SHE IS MY TORTURE NONE THE LESS
BUT PARTLY THAT SHE DREADED THE SECRET OR UNDISGUISED INTERFERENCE OF OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AND PARTLY THAT HER CONSCIOUS HEART IMPARTED SUSPICION WHERE NONE COULD HAVE BEEN FELT AND PARTLY THAT BOTH THE MINISTER AND SHE WOULD NEED THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD TO BREATHE IN WHILE THEY TALKED TOGETHER--FOR ALL THESE REASONS HESTER NEVER THOUGHT OF MEETING HIM IN ANY NARROWER PRIVACY THAN BENEATH THE OPEN SKY
THE UNLIKELIEST MATERIALS--A STICK A BUNCH OF RAGS A FLOWER--WERE THE PUPPETS OF PEARL'S WITCHCRAFT AND WITHOUT UNDERGOING ANY OUTWARD CHANGE BECAME SPIRITUALLY ADAPTED TO WHATEVER DRAMA OCCUPIED THE STAGE OF HER INNER WORLD
I WOULD HAVE THEE BETAKE THYSELF TO PLAY AND LEAVE ME TO SPEAK WITH HIM THAT COMES YONDER IS IT THE BLACK MAN ASKED PEARL
WE DREAM IN OUR WAKING MOMENTS AND WALK IN OUR SLEEP
WILL NOT MY AID BE REQUISITE TO PUT YOU IN HEART AND STRENGTH TO PREACH YOUR ELECTION SERMON NAY I THINK NOT SO REJOINED THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE
BUT BETRAY ME NOT WHEREFORE DOST THOU DESIRE IT INQUIRED HESTER SHRINKING SHE HARDLY KNEW WHY FROM THIS SECRET BOND
THE LIGHT LINGERED ABOUT THE LONELY CHILD AS IF GLAD OF SUCH A PLAYMATE UNTIL HER MOTHER HAD DRAWN ALMOST NIGH ENOUGH TO STEP INTO THE MAGIC CIRCLE TOO
SO SOMBRE IS IT AND RELIEVED ONLY BY ONE EVER-GLOWING POINT OF LIGHT GLOOMIER THAN THE SHADOW ON A FIELD SABLE THE LETTER A GULES END OF PROJECT GUTENBERG'S THE SCARLET LETTER BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE
HIS KIND WATCHFUL SYMPATHISING BUT NEVER INTRUSIVE FRIEND
AND PEARL WAS THE ONENESS OF THEIR BEING
GREAT WERE THE WEARINESS AND ANNOYANCE OF THE OLD INSPECTOR AND THE WEIGHERS AND GAUGERS WHOSE SLUMBERS WERE DISTURBED BY THE UNMERCIFULLY LENGTHENED TRAMP OF MY PASSING AND RETURNING FOOTSTEPS
AND THAT THE GLEAM OF THE LANTERN WOULD FALL UPON HIM IN A FEW MOMENTS MORE AND REVEAL HIS LONG-HIDDEN SECRET
AND THEN WHAT A HAPPINESS WOULD IT HAVE BEEN COULD HESTER PRYNNE HAVE HEARD HER CLEAR BIRD-LIKE VOICE MINGLING WITH THE UPROAR OF OTHER CHILDISH VOICES AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED AND UNRAVELLED HER OWN DARLING'S TONES AMID ALL THE ENTANGLED OUTCRY OF A GROUP OF SPORTIVE CHILDREN
HE HAD BY THIS TIME REACHED HIS DWELLING ON THE EDGE OF THE BURIAL GROUND AND HASTENING UP THE STAIRS TOOK REFUGE IN HIS STUDY
HESTER PRYNNE LIKEWISE HAD INVOLUNTARILY LOOKED UP AND ALL THESE FOUR PERSONS OLD AND YOUNG REGARDED ONE ANOTHER IN SILENCE TILL THE CHILD LAUGHED ALOUD AND SHOUTED--"COME AWAY MOTHER
WHY THEN HAD HE COME HITHER
THESE HAD BEEN HER TEACHERS--STERN AND WILD ONES--AND THEY HAD MADE HER STRONG BUT TAUGHT HER MUCH AMISS
THE FRAMEWORK OF HIS NATURE ORIGINALLY STRONG AND MASSIVE WAS NOT YET CRUMPLED INTO RUIN
YEA WOMAN THOU SAYEST TRULY CRIED OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH LETTING THE LURID FIRE OF HIS HEART BLAZE OUT BEFORE HER EYES
A RILL FROM THE TOWN-PUMP WITH REMARKS BY TELBA 1857
HE MUST DISCERN THEE IN THY TRUE CHARACTER
AT HOME WITHIN AND AROUND HER MOTHER'S COTTAGE PEARL WANTED NOT A WIDE AND VARIOUS CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE
BUT ANOTHER TIME AND WHAT OTHER TIME PERSISTED THE CHILD
THAT FINALLY TO THIS POOR PILGRIM ON HIS DREARY AND DESERT PATH FAINT SICK MISERABLE THERE APPEARED A GLIMPSE OF HUMAN AFFECTION AND SYMPATHY A NEW LIFE AND A TRUE ONE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HEAVY DOOM WHICH HE WAS NOW EXPIATING
LOOK YOUR LAST ON THE SCARLET LETTER AND ITS WEARER!"--THE PEOPLE'S VICTIM AND LIFELONG BOND-SLAVE AS THEY FANCIED HER MIGHT SAY TO THEM
IT IS COLD AND DEAD AND CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME
THEY WERE ALLOWED ON MY REPRESENTATION TO REST FROM THEIR ARDUOUS LABOURS AND SOON AFTERWARDS--AS IF THEIR SOLE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE HAD BEEN ZEAL FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S SERVICE--AS I VERILY BELIEVE IT WAS--WITHDREW TO A BETTER WORLD
COULD THEY BE OTHER THAN THE INSIDIOUS WHISPERS OF THE BAD ANGEL WHO WOULD FAIN HAVE PERSUADED THE STRUGGLING WOMAN AS YET ONLY HALF HIS VICTIM THAT THE OUTWARD GUISE OF PURITY WAS BUT A LIE AND THAT IF TRUTH WERE EVERYWHERE TO BE SHOWN A SCARLET LETTER WOULD BLAZE FORTH ON MANY A BOSOM BESIDES HESTER PRYNNE'S
THAT HE NOW BREATHES AND CREEPS ABOUT ON EARTH IS OWING ALL TO ME BETTER HE HAD DIED AT ONCE SAID HESTER PRYNNE
VERILY DEAR SIR WE MUST TAKE PAINS TO MAKE YOU STRONG AND VIGOROUS FOR THIS OCCASION OF THE ELECTION DISCOURSE
WHEN HOWEVER IT FORMS ITS JUDGMENT AS IT USUALLY DOES ON THE INTUITIONS OF ITS GREAT AND WARM HEART THE CONCLUSIONS THUS ATTAINED ARE OFTEN SO PROFOUND AND SO UNERRING AS TO POSSESS THE CHARACTER OF TRUTH SUPERNATURALLY REVEALED
AWAKING HOWEVER ONCE OR TWICE IN THE FORENOON TO BORE ONE ANOTHER WITH THE SEVERAL THOUSANDTH REPETITION OF OLD SEA-STORIES AND MOULDY JOKES THAT HAD GROWN TO BE PASSWORDS AND COUNTERSIGNS AMONG THEM
IT WAS AN OBSCURE NIGHT IN EARLY MAY
BUT UNDER THE LEADEN INFLICTION WHICH IT WAS HER DOOM TO ENDURE SHE FELT AT MOMENTS AS IF SHE MUST NEEDS SHRIEK OUT WITH THE FULL POWER OF HER LUNGS AND CAST HERSELF FROM THE SCAFFOLD DOWN UPON THE GROUND OR ELSE GO MAD AT ONCE
THESE PERHAPS IF MORE DISTINCTLY HEARD MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONLY A GROSSER MEDIUM AND HAVE CLOGGED THE SPIRITUAL SENSE
EVEN HIS COLLEGE DAYS AT BOWDOIN DID NOT QUITE BREAK THROUGH HIS ACQUIRED AND INHERITED RESERVE
A DUSKY TUMULT WOULD FLAP ITS WINGS FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER
THE SHRIEK HAD PERHAPS SOUNDED WITH A FAR GREATER POWER TO HIS OWN STARTLED EARS THAN IT ACTUALLY POSSESSED
I AM POWERLESS TO GO
MY LITTLE PEARL SAID HE FEEBLY AND THERE WAS A SWEET AND GENTLE SMILE OVER HIS FACE AS OF A SPIRIT SINKING INTO DEEP REPOSE
OR ART THOU ONE OF THOSE NAUGHTY ELFS OR FAIRIES WHOM WE THOUGHT TO HAVE LEFT BEHIND US WITH OTHER RELICS OF PAPISTRY IN MERRY OLD ENGLAND I AM MOTHER'S CHILD ANSWERED THE SCARLET VISION AND MY NAME IS PEARL PEARL?--RUBY RATHER--OR CORAL!--OR RED ROSE AT THE VERY LEAST JUDGING FROM THY HUE RESPONDED THE OLD MINISTER PUTTING FORTH HIS HAND IN A VAIN ATTEMPT TO PAT LITTLE PEARL ON THE CHEEK
OH I AM YOUR LITTLE PEARL ANSWERED THE CHILD
UNLESS IT AVAIL HIM SOMEWHAT THAT HE WAS BROKEN DOWN BY LONG AND EXQUISITE SUFFERING
THERE IS NO SUBSTANCE IN IT
THEY GREW OUT OF HIS HEART AND TYPIFY IT MAY BE SOME HIDEOUS SECRET THAT WAS BURIED WITH HIM AND WHICH HE HAD DONE BETTER TO CONFESS DURING HIS LIFETIME PERCHANCE SAID MR DIMMESDALE HE EARNESTLY DESIRED IT BUT COULD NOT AND WHEREFORE REJOINED THE PHYSICIAN
WHAT SAY YOU TO IT ONCE AGAIN BROTHER DIMMESDALE
THE EARLIER DOCUMENTS AND ARCHIVES OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE HAVING PROBABLY BEEN CARRIED OFF TO HALIFAX WHEN ALL THE KING'S OFFICIALS ACCOMPANIED THE BRITISH ARMY IN ITS FLIGHT FROM BOSTON
THOU CANST SEE HIM NOW THROUGH THE TREES
THERE WAS MUCH JOY THROUGHOUT THE TOWN WHEN THIS GREATLY DESIRABLE OBJECT WAS ATTAINED
MR DIMMESDALE WAS A TRUE PRIEST A TRUE RELIGIONIST WITH THE REVERENTIAL SENTIMENT LARGELY DEVELOPED AND AN ORDER OF MIND THAT IMPELLED ITSELF POWERFULLY ALONG THE TRACK OF A CREED AND WORE ITS PASSAGE CONTINUALLY DEEPER WITH THE LAPSE OF TIME
THE REVELATION OF THE SCARLET LETTER CHAPTER XXIV
AS NIGHT APPROACHED IT PROVING IMPOSSIBLE TO QUELL HER INSUBORDINATION BY REBUKE OR THREATS OF PUNISHMENT MASTER BRACKETT THE JAILER THOUGHT FIT TO INTRODUCE A PHYSICIAN
HE LOVES THEE MY LITTLE PEARL AND LOVES THY MOTHER TOO
AND STRANGELY ENOUGH THE SENSE THAT HE WAS A PROFESSIONAL TEACHER OF THE TRUTH IMPELLED HIM TO ANSWER THE CHILD SO
OR MIGHT IT SUFFICE HIM THAT EVERY WHOLESOME GROWTH SHOULD BE CONVERTED INTO SOMETHING DELETERIOUS AND MALIGNANT AT HIS TOUCH
LITERATURE ITS EXERTIONS AND OBJECTS WERE NOW OF LITTLE MOMENT IN MY REGARD
WILL HE CONTINUE THEN TO KEEP OUR SECRET
HE HAD STRIVEN TO PUT A CHEAT UPON HIMSELF BY MAKING THE AVOWAL OF A GUILTY CONSCIENCE BUT HAD GAINED ONLY ONE OTHER SIN AND A SELF-ACKNOWLEDGED SHAME WITHOUT THE MOMENTARY RELIEF OF BEING SELF-DECEIVED
BY THIS TIME THE PRELIMINARY PRAYER HAD BEEN OFFERED IN THE MEETING-HOUSE AND THE ACCENTS OF THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE WERE HEARD COMMENCING HIS DISCOURSE
BUT BEFORE MR DIMMESDALE HAD DONE SPEAKING A LIGHT GLEAMED FAR AND WIDE OVER ALL THE MUFFLED SKY
AND SHE TOOK THE OATH
IT IS A CURIOUS SUBJECT OF OBSERVATION AND INQUIRY WHETHER HATRED AND LOVE BE NOT THE SAME THING AT BOTTOM
WHEN THUS PERPLEXED--AND COGITATING AMONG OTHER HYPOTHESES WHETHER THE LETTER MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE DECORATIONS WHICH THE WHITE MEN USED TO CONTRIVE IN ORDER TO TAKE THE EYES OF INDIANS--I HAPPENED TO PLACE IT ON MY BREAST
A SQUIRREL FROM THE LOFTY DEPTHS OF HIS DOMESTIC TREE CHATTERED EITHER IN ANGER OR MERRIMENT--FOR THE SQUIRREL IS SUCH A CHOLERIC AND HUMOROUS LITTLE PERSONAGE THAT IT IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS MOODS--SO HE CHATTERED AT THE CHILD AND FLUNG DOWN A NUT UPON HER HEAD
IT COULD HAVE CAUSED HER NO DEEPER PANG HAD THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHISPERED THE DARK STORY AMONG THEMSELVES--HAD THE SUMMER BREEZE MURMURED ABOUT IT--HAD THE WINTRY BLAST SHRIEKED IT ALOUD
AND HOWEVER WHITE AND CLEAR ORIGINALLY THEY HAD TAKEN THE DEEP STAINS OF CRIMSON AND GOLD THE FIERY LUSTRE THE BLACK SHADOW AND THE UNTEMPERED LIGHT OF THE INTERVENING SUBSTANCE
ALL THE LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FOLIAGE OF HER CHARACTER HAD BEEN WITHERED UP BY THIS RED-HOT BRAND AND HAD LONG AGO FALLEN AWAY LEAVING A BARE AND HARSH OUTLINE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN REPULSIVE HAD SHE POSSESSED FRIENDS OR COMPANIONS TO BE REPELLED BY IT
A LETTER--THE LETTER A--BUT FRESHLY GREEN INSTEAD OF SCARLET
THOU HADST GREAT ELEMENTS
ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HOWEVER WAS INCLINED TO BE HARDLY IF AT ALL LESS SATISFIED WITH THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS WHICH PROVIDENCE--USING THE AVENGER AND HIS VICTIM FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES AND PERCHANCE PARDONING WHERE IT SEEMED MOST TO PUNISH--HAD SUBSTITUTED FOR HIS BLACK DEVICES
AND NOW THIS FATEFUL INTERVIEW HAD COME TO A CLOSE
HE REJECTED ALL SUGGESTIONS OF THE KIND AS IF PRIESTLY CELIBACY WERE ONE OF HIS ARTICLES OF CHURCH DISCIPLINE
GHOST OF A MOTHER--THINNEST FANTASY OF A MOTHER--METHINKS SHE MIGHT YET HAVE THROWN A PITYING GLANCE TOWARDS HER SON
THERE IT IS PLAYING A GOOD WAY OFF
IN THIS MANNER HESTER PRYNNE CAME TO HAVE A PART TO PERFORM IN THE WORLD
BUT SINCE THAT MOMENT IT HAS ALL BEEN A DARK NECESSITY
IF THE CHILDREN GATHERED ABOUT HER AS THEY SOMETIMES DID PEARL WOULD GROW POSITIVELY TERRIBLE IN HER PUNY WRATH SNATCHING UP STONES TO FLING AT THEM WITH SHRILL INCOHERENT EXCLAMATIONS THAT MADE HER MOTHER TREMBLE BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH THE SOUND OF A WITCH'S ANATHEMAS IN SOME UNKNOWN TONGUE
THEY DISCUSSED EVERY TOPIC OF ETHICS AND RELIGION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND PRIVATE CHARACTER
HOW DREARY LOOKED THE FOREST-TRACK THAT LED BACKWARD TO THE SETTLEMENT WHERE HESTER PRYNNE MUST TAKE UP AGAIN THE BURDEN OF HER IGNOMINY AND THE MINISTER THE HOLLOW MOCKERY OF HIS GOOD NAME
IS IT TRUE MOTHER
THE CHILD COULD NOT BE MADE AMENABLE TO RULES
HE WAS HEARD TO SPEAK OF SIR KENELM DIGBY AND OTHER FAMOUS MEN--WHOSE SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS WERE ESTEEMED HARDLY LESS THAN SUPERNATURAL--AS HAVING BEEN HIS CORRESPONDENTS OR ASSOCIATES
AMONGST ANY OTHER POPULATION OR AT A LATER PERIOD IN THE HISTORY OF NEW ENGLAND THE GRIM RIGIDITY THAT PETRIFIED THE BEARDED PHYSIOGNOMIES OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE WOULD HAVE AUGURED SOME AWFUL BUSINESS IN HAND
YET HE TREMBLED AND TURNED TO HESTER WITH AN EXPRESSION OF DOUBT AND ANXIETY IN HIS EYES NOT THE LESS EVIDENTLY BETRAYED THAT THERE WAS A FEEBLE SMILE UPON HIS LIPS
I KNOW THEE HESTER FOR I BEHOLD THE TOKEN
THE MOTHER HERSELF--AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM--HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
THEIR LOVE FOR MAN THEIR ZEAL FOR GOD'S SERVICE--THESE HOLY IMPULSES MAY OR MAY NOT COEXIST IN THEIR HEARTS WITH THE EVIL INMATES TO WHICH THEIR GUILT HAS UNBARRED THE DOOR AND WHICH MUST NEEDS PROPAGATE A HELLISH BREED WITHIN THEM
AS IF ALL WERE OF SIMILAR IMPORTANCE OR ALL ALIKE A PLAY
A DECAYED HOUSE OF GREY STONE WITH A POVERTY-STRICKEN ASPECT BUT RETAINING A HALF OBLITERATED SHIELD OF ARMS OVER THE PORTAL IN TOKEN OF ANTIQUE GENTILITY
WHY DID WE NOT FIND IT SOONER LET US NOT LOOK BACK ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE
MORNING WOULD BREAK AND FIND HIM THERE
ACCORDING TO THESE HIGHLY-RESPECTABLE WITNESSES THE MINISTER CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS DYING--CONSCIOUS ALSO THAT THE REVERENCE OF THE MULTITUDE PLACED HIM ALREADY AMONG SAINTS AND ANGELS--HAD DESIRED BY YIELDING UP HIS BREATH IN THE ARMS OF THAT FALLEN WOMAN TO EXPRESS TO THE WORLD HOW UTTERLY NUGATORY IS THE CHOICEST OF MAN'S OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHAT HE REALLY DID WHISPER THE MINISTER COULD NEVER AFTERWARDS RECOLLECT
HESTER PRYNNE--SLOWLY AS IF IMPELLED BY INEVITABLE FATE AND AGAINST HER STRONGEST WILL--LIKEWISE DREW NEAR BUT PAUSED BEFORE SHE REACHED HIM
THERE WAS FIRE IN HER AND THROUGHOUT HER
THE STRUGGLE IF THERE WERE ONE NEED NOT BE DESCRIBED
I CAN YET SAVE YOU
LITTLE ACCUSTOMED IN HER LONG SECLUSION FROM SOCIETY TO MEASURE HER IDEAS OF RIGHT AND WRONG BY ANY STANDARD EXTERNAL TO HERSELF HESTER SAW--OR SEEMED TO SEE--THAT THERE LAY A RESPONSIBILITY UPON HER IN REFERENCE TO THE CLERGYMAN WHICH SHE OWNED TO NO OTHER NOR TO THE WHOLE WORLD BESIDES
THE CRY HAD EVIDENTLY STARTLED HIM
LATHROP A STUDY OF HAWTHORNE 1876
HAD IT BEEN OTHERWISE--HAD AN ACTIVE POLITICIAN BEEN PUT INTO THIS INFLUENTIAL POST TO ASSUME THE EASY TASK OF MAKING HEAD AGAINST A WHIG COLLECTOR WHOSE INFIRMITIES WITHHELD HIM FROM THE PERSONAL ADMINISTRATION OF HIS OFFICE--HARDLY A MAN OF THE OLD CORPS WOULD HAVE DRAWN THE BREATH OF OFFICIAL LIFE WITHIN A MONTH AFTER THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL HAD COME UP THE CUSTOM-HOUSE STEPS
A FOX STARTLED FROM HIS SLEEP BY HER LIGHT FOOTSTEP ON THE LEAVES LOOKED INQUISITIVELY AT PEARL AS DOUBTING WHETHER IT WERE BETTER TO STEAL OFF OR RENEW HIS NAP ON THE SAME SPOT
BUT AT ANY RATE I LEARNED IT THOROUGHLY
HESTER PRYNNE GAZING STEADFASTLY AT THE CLERGYMAN FELT A DREARY INFLUENCE COME OVER HER BUT WHEREFORE OR WHENCE SHE KNEW NOT UNLESS THAT HE SEEMED SO REMOTE FROM HER OWN SPHERE AND UTTERLY BEYOND HER REACH
AND HIMSELF SECURE IN THE WISE LIBERALITY OF THE SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD HELD OFFICE HE HAD BEEN THE SAFETY OF HIS SUBORDINATES IN MANY AN HOUR OF DANGER AND HEART-QUAKE
SHE SHALL NEVER KNOW AN EARTHLY ONE SHE WILL NOT SPEAK MURMURED MR DIMMESDALE WHO LEANING OVER THE BALCONY WITH HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART HAD AWAITED THE RESULT OF HIS APPEAL
WAVE BACK THAT WOMAN
BY THY FIRST STEP AWRY THOU DIDST PLANT THE GERM OF EVIL
WRESTLING MATCHES IN THE DIFFERENT FASHIONS OF CORNWALL AND DEVONSHIRE WERE SEEN HERE AND THERE ABOUT THE MARKET-PLACE
LIKE ALL OTHER MUSIC IT BREATHED PASSION AND PATHOS AND EMOTIONS HIGH OR TENDER IN A TONGUE NATIVE TO THE HUMAN HEART WHEREVER EDUCATED
AND WHO MIGHT WELL THEREFORE BE MORE PROFOUNDLY VERSED IN SUCH SOLID AND VALUABLE ATTAINMENTS THAN THEIR YOUTHFUL BROTHER
IF THE SAME MULTITUDE WHICH HAD STOOD AS EYE-WITNESSES WHILE HESTER PRYNNE SUSTAINED HER PUNISHMENT COULD NOW HAVE BEEN SUMMONED FORTH THEY WOULD HAVE DISCERNED NO FACE ABOVE THE PLATFORM NOR HARDLY THE OUTLINE OF A HUMAN SHAPE IN THE DARK GREY OF THE MIDNIGHT
HER SHADOW HAD FADED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
WOMAN WOMAN THOU ART ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS!--I CANNOT FORGIVE THEE THOU SHALT FORGIVE ME CRIED HESTER FLINGING HERSELF ON THE FALLEN LEAVES BESIDE HIM
IT WAS THE PLACE WHENCE PROCLAMATIONS WERE WONT TO BE MADE AMIDST AN ASSEMBLAGE OF THE MAGISTRACY WITH ALL THE CEREMONIAL THAT ATTENDED SUCH PUBLIC OBSERVANCES IN THOSE DAYS
ELSE IT MIGHT MAKE ME PERMANENTLY OTHER THAN I HAD BEEN WITHOUT TRANSFORMING ME INTO ANY SHAPE WHICH IT WOULD BE WORTH MY WHILE TO TAKE
SHE SAW HER OWN FACE GLOWING WITH GIRLISH BEAUTY AND ILLUMINATING ALL THE INTERIOR OF THE DUSKY MIRROR IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WONT TO GAZE AT IT
AT THE FINAL HOUR WHEN SHE WAS SO SOON TO FLING ASIDE THE BURNING LETTER IT HAD STRANGELY BECOME THE CENTRE OF MORE REMARK AND EXCITEMENT AND WAS THUS MADE TO SEAR HER BREAST MORE PAINFULLY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE FIRST DAY SHE PUT IT ON
WILT THOU GO AND PLAY CHILD REPEATED HER MOTHER BUT DO NOT STRAY FAR INTO THE WOOD
THESE LATTER QUALITIES INDEED BEING IN BARELY ENOUGH MEASURE TO KEEP THE OLD GENTLEMAN FROM WALKING ON ALL-FOURS
IF SHE BE ALL TENDERNESS SHE WILL DIE
LET GOD PUNISH
I MUST DIE HERE
SUCH WAS THE SYMPATHY OF NATURE--THAT WILD HEATHEN NATURE OF THE FOREST NEVER SUBJUGATED BY HUMAN LAW NOR ILLUMINED BY HIGHER TRUTH--WITH THE BLISS OF THESE TWO SPIRITS
IT WAS--WE BLUSH TO TELL IT--IT WAS TO STOP SHORT IN THE ROAD AND TEACH SOME VERY WICKED WORDS TO A KNOT OF LITTLE PURITAN CHILDREN WHO WERE PLAYING THERE AND HAD BUT JUST BEGUN TO TALK
NOR DID SHE PUT THE QUESTION ALTOGETHER IDLY BUT FOR THE MOMENT WITH A PORTION OF GENUINE EARNESTNESS
BUT NEVER UNTIL NOW HAD SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF TO ASK WHETHER LINKED WITH THAT DESIGN THERE MIGHT NOT LIKEWISE BE A PURPOSE OF MERCY AND BENEFICENCE
SO MUCH FOR MY FIGURATIVE SELF
THE NEW ENGLAND HOLIDAY BETIMES IN THE MORNING OF THE DAY ON WHICH THE NEW GOVERNOR WAS TO RECEIVE HIS OFFICE AT THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE HESTER PRYNNE AND LITTLE PEARL CAME INTO THE MARKET-PLACE
IN SUCH GUISE HAD PEARL ADORNED HERSELF WHEN SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S VOICE AND CAME SLOWLY BACK
YOU BURROW AND RANKLE IN HIS HEART
IN ACCOMPLISHING THE MAIN PURPOSE IT HAS APPEARED ALLOWABLE BY A FEW EXTRA TOUCHES TO GIVE A FAINT REPRESENTATION OF A MODE OF LIFE NOT HERETOFORE DESCRIBED TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE CHARACTERS THAT MOVE IN IT AMONG WHOM THE AUTHOR HAPPENED TO MAKE ONE
A WRITER OF STORY BOOKS
WITH A WHOLE PEOPLE DRAWN FORTH AS TO A FESTIVAL STARING AT THE FEATURES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN ONLY IN THE QUIET GLEAM OF THE FIRESIDE IN THE HAPPY SHADOW OF A HOME OR BENEATH A MATRONLY VEIL AT CHURCH
OLD GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WOULD COME GRIMLY FORTH WITH HIS KING JAMES RUFF FASTENED ASKEW AND MISTRESS HIBBINS WITH SOME TWIGS OF THE FOREST CLINGING TO HER SKIRTS AND LOOKING SOURER THAN EVER AS HAVING HARDLY GOT A WINK OF SLEEP AFTER HER NIGHT RIDE
SO WITH LIGHTSOME HEARTS AND THE HAPPY CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING USEFULLY EMPLOYED--IN THEIR OWN BEHALF AT LEAST IF NOT FOR OUR BELOVED COUNTRY--THESE GOOD OLD GENTLEMEN WENT THROUGH THE VARIOUS FORMALITIES OF OFFICE
COME WITH ME I BESEECH YOU REVEREND SIR ELSE YOU WILL BE POORLY ABLE TO DO SABBATH DUTY TO-MORROW
ON WHICH HOWEVER I SHOULD BE GLAD TO DWELL AT CONSIDERABLY MORE LENGTH BECAUSE OF ALL MEN WHOM I HAVE EVER KNOWN THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS FITTEST TO BE A CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER
HE DEEMED IT ESSENTIAL IT WOULD SEEM TO KNOW THE MAN BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO DO HIM GOOD
NOT TO BE ANTICIPATED NOR DESIRED
LIFE OF FRANKLIN PIERCE 1852
IF SHE ENTERED A CHURCH TRUSTING TO SHARE THE SABBATH SMILE OF THE UNIVERSAL FATHER IT WAS OFTEN HER MISHAP TO FIND HERSELF THE TEXT OF THE DISCOURSE
THIS VESSEL HAD RECENTLY ARRIVED FROM THE SPANISH MAIN AND WITHIN THREE DAYS TIME WOULD SAIL FOR BRISTOL

2ND SERIES 1842
AND DOST THOU GO TO MEET HIM IN THE NIGHTTIME DIDST THOU EVER AWAKE AND FIND THY MOTHER GONE ASKED HESTER
IT IS WITH BOTH A GLEAM THAT PLAYS UPON THE SURFACE AND IMPARTS A SUNNY AND CHEERY ASPECT ALIKE TO THE GREEN BRANCH AND GREY MOULDERING TRUNK
BUT HESTER PRYNNE WITH A MIND OF NATIVE COURAGE AND ACTIVITY AND FOR SO LONG A PERIOD NOT MERELY ESTRANGED BUT OUTLAWED FROM SOCIETY HAD HABITUATED HERSELF TO SUCH LATITUDE OF SPECULATION AS WAS ALTOGETHER FOREIGN TO THE CLERGYMAN
NOTHING IS TOO SMALL OR TOO TRIFLING TO UNDERGO THIS CHANGE AND ACQUIRE DIGNITY THEREBY
BETTER TO FAST AND PRAY UPON IT
THE THREE FORMED AN ELECTRIC CHAIN
AND THERE WAS THE SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST
IN THE MERE EXERCISE OF THE FANCY HOWEVER AND THE SPORTIVENESS OF A GROWING MIND THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE THAN WAS OBSERVABLE IN OTHER CHILDREN OF BRIGHT FACULTIES
AND I AM THY LITTLE PEARL IN A MOOD OF TENDERNESS THAT WAS NOT USUAL WITH HER SHE DREW DOWN HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND KISSED HER BROW AND BOTH HER CHEEKS
WOULD NOT THE EARTH QUICKENED TO AN EVIL PURPOSE BY THE SYMPATHY OF HIS EYE GREET HIM WITH POISONOUS SHRUBS OF SPECIES HITHERTO UNKNOWN THAT WOULD START UP UNDER HIS FINGERS
ART THOU NOT AFRAID OF NIGHTMARES AND HIDEOUS DREAMS WHY DOST THOU SMILE SO AT ME INQUIRED HESTER TROUBLED AT THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYES
BUT IT WILL CALM THE SWELL AND HEAVING OF THY PASSION LIKE OIL THROWN ON THE WAVES OF A TEMPESTUOUS SEA HE PRESENTED THE CUP TO HESTER WHO RECEIVED IT WITH A SLOW EARNEST LOOK INTO HIS FACE
SINCE THE LATTER RAMBLED FROM HER SIDE ANOTHER INMATE HAD BEEN ADMITTED WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THE MOTHER'S FEELINGS AND SO MODIFIED THE ASPECT OF THEM ALL THAT PEARL THE RETURNING WANDERER COULD NOT FIND HER WONTED PLACE AND HARDLY KNEW WHERE SHE WAS
AND HERE AGAIN WAS THE SCARLET MISERY GLITTERING ON THE OLD SPOT
YET HESTER WAS HARDLY SAFE IN CONFIDING HERSELF TO THAT GUSTY TENDERNESS
BUT THE SENTIMENT HAS LIKEWISE ITS MORAL QUALITY
MR DIMMESDALE GENTLY REPELLED THEIR ENTREATIES
OR TO JUDGE FROM THE BRIGHT EXPRESSION THAT WAS DANCING ON PEARL'S FEATURES HER MOTHER COULD HAVE FANCIED THAT THE CHILD HAD ABSORBED IT INTO HERSELF AND WOULD GIVE IT FORTH AGAIN WITH A GLEAM ABOUT HER PATH AS THEY SHOULD PLUNGE INTO SOME GLOOMIER SHADE
FOR HESTER I AM A DYING MAN
THERE WERE BOTH TRUTH AND ERROR IN THE IMPRESSION
YOU HAVE DEEPLY AND SORELY REPENTED
DO NOT CRY DEAR LITTLE PEARL
NOTHING AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID BUT INSTINCTS
SEE NOW HOW THEY TROUBLE THE BRAIN--THESE BOOKS!--THESE BOOKS
THE SAINTED MINISTER IN THE CHURCH
ONE AFTERNOON WALKING WITH PEARL IN A RETIRED PART OF THE PENINSULA SHE BEHELD THE OLD PHYSICIAN WITH A BASKET ON ONE ARM AND A STAFF IN THE OTHER HAND STOOPING ALONG THE GROUND IN QUEST OF ROOTS AND HERBS TO CONCOCT HIS MEDICINE WITHAL
THIS DISTINCTION COULD MORE JUSTLY BE CLAIMED BY SOME MARINERS--A PART OF THE CREW OF THE VESSEL FROM THE SPANISH MAIN--WHO HAD COME ASHORE TO SEE THE HUMOURS OF ELECTION DAY
CANST THOU TELL ME MY CHILD WHO MADE THEE NOW PEARL KNEW WELL ENOUGH WHO MADE HER FOR HESTER PRYNNE THE DAUGHTER OF A PIOUS HOME VERY SOON AFTER HER TALK WITH THE CHILD ABOUT HER HEAVENLY FATHER HAD BEGUN TO INFORM HER OF THOSE TRUTHS WHICH THE HUMAN SPIRIT AT WHATEVER STAGE OF IMMATURITY IMBIBES WITH SUCH EAGER INTEREST
NOT THAT I REMEMBER SAID THE CHILD
WOULD NOT THE PEOPLE START UP IN THEIR SEATS BY A SIMULTANEOUS IMPULSE AND TEAR HIM DOWN OUT OF THE PULPIT WHICH HE DEFILED
LET ME ASK AS YOUR FRIEND AS ONE HAVING CHARGE UNDER PROVIDENCE OF YOUR LIFE AND PHYSICAL WELL BEING HATH ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THIS DISORDER BEEN FAIRLY LAID OPEN AND RECOUNTED TO ME HOW CAN YOU QUESTION IT ASKED THE MINISTER
THERE WAS ONE MAN ESPECIALLY THE OBSERVATION OF WHOSE CHARACTER GAVE ME A NEW IDEA OF TALENT
THERE DWELT THERE TRODE THE FEET OF ONE WITH WHOM SHE DEEMED HERSELF CONNECTED IN A UNION THAT UNRECOGNISED ON EARTH WOULD BRING THEM TOGETHER BEFORE THE BAR OF FINAL JUDGMENT AND MAKE THAT THEIR MARRIAGE-ALTAR FOR A JOINT FUTURITY OF ENDLESS RETRIBUTION
SEPTIMIUS FELTON
X
HESTER PRYNNE SAID HE FIXING HIS NATURALLY STERN REGARD ON THE WEARER OF THE SCARLET LETTER THERE HATH BEEN MUCH QUESTION CONCERNING THEE OF LATE
IN PERMITTING THIS I HAVE SURELY ACTED A FALSE PART BY THE ONLY MAN TO WHOM THE POWER WAS LEFT ME TO BE TRUE WHAT CHOICE HAD YOU ASKED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
THE STIGMA GONE HESTER HEAVED A LONG DEEP SIGH IN WHICH THE BURDEN OF SHAME AND ANGUISH DEPARTED FROM HER SPIRIT
AFTER AWHILE THE MINISTER FIXED HIS EYES ON HESTER PRYNNE'S
IS HESTER PRYNNE THE LESS MISERABLE THINK YOU FOR THAT SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST I DO VERILY BELIEVE IT ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN
BE THAT AS IT MIGHT THE SCAFFOLD OF THE PILLORY WAS A POINT OF VIEW THAT REVEALED TO HESTER PRYNNE THE ENTIRE TRACK ALONG WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TREADING SINCE HER HAPPY INFANCY
PERADVENTURE THE GUILTY ONE STANDS LOOKING ON AT THIS SAD SPECTACLE UNKNOWN OF MAN AND FORGETTING THAT GOD SEES HIM THE LEARNED MAN OBSERVED THE STRANGER WITH ANOTHER SMILE SHOULD COME HIMSELF TO LOOK INTO THE MYSTERY IT BEHOVES HIM WELL IF HE BE STILL IN LIFE RESPONDED THE TOWNSMAN
NO EVIDENCE AT ONCE SO SLIGHT AND IRREFRAGABLE OF A SUBTLE DISEASE THAT HAD LONG SINCE BEGUN TO EAT INTO THE REAL SUBSTANCE OF HIS CHARACTER
AT LEAST THEY SHALL SAY OF ME THOUGHT THIS EXEMPLARY MAN THAT I LEAVE NO PUBLIC DUTY UNPERFORMED OR ILL-PERFORMED SAD INDEED THAT AN INTROSPECTION SO PROFOUND AND ACUTE AS THIS POOR MINISTER'S SHOULD BE SO MISERABLY DECEIVED
UNBENDING THE RIGID FOLDS OF THE PARCHMENT COVER I FOUND IT TO BE A COMMISSION UNDER THE HAND AND SEAL OF GOVERNOR SHIRLEY IN FAVOUR OF ONE JONATHAN PUE AS SURVEYOR OF HIS MAJESTY'S CUSTOMS FOR THE PORT OF SALEM IN THE PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY
TO HESTER'S EYE THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE EXHIBITED NO SYMPTOM OF POSITIVE AND VIVACIOUS SUFFERING EXCEPT THAT AS LITTLE PEARL HAD REMARKED HE KEPT HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
THE SOIL WHERE THIS DARK MINER WAS WORKING HAD PERCHANCE SHOWN INDICATIONS THAT ENCOURAGED HIM
WILT THOU RIDE WITH ME SOME FINE NIGHT TO SEE THY FATHER
AND TAKE HEED THAT THOU COME AT MY FIRST CALL YES MOTHER ANSWERED PEARL BUT IF IT BE THE BLACK MAN WILT THOU NOT LET ME STAY A MOMENT AND LOOK AT HIM WITH HIS BIG BOOK UNDER HIS ARM GO SILLY CHILD SAID HER MOTHER IMPATIENTLY
WHAT DOES THE LETTER MEAN MOTHER
BUT OF LATE SINCE THE NIGHT OF HIS VIGIL ALL HER SYMPATHIES TOWARDS HIM HAD BEEN BOTH SOFTENED AND INVIGORATED
IT IS AS WELL TO HAVE MADE THIS STEP SAID ROGER CHILLINGWORTH TO HIMSELF LOOKING AFTER THE MINISTER WITH A GRAVE SMILE
A STRANGE SYMPATHY BETWIXT SOUL AND BODY
BY ANOTHER IMPULSE SHE TOOK OFF THE FORMAL CAP THAT CONFINED HER HAIR AND DOWN IT FELL UPON HER SHOULDERS DARK AND RICH WITH AT ONCE A SHADOW AND A LIGHT IN ITS ABUNDANCE AND IMPARTING THE CHARM OF SOFTNESS TO HER FEATURES
BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD--TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN--TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES--NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
CONSCIOUS OF HIS OWN INFIRMITY--THAT HIS TEMPERED STEEL AND ELASTICITY ARE LOST--HE FOR EVER AFTERWARDS LOOKS WISTFULLY ABOUT HIM IN QUEST OF SUPPORT EXTERNAL TO HIMSELF
THE DECISION ONCE MADE A GLOW OF STRANGE ENJOYMENT THREW ITS FLICKERING BRIGHTNESS OVER THE TROUBLE OF HIS BREAST
AS THE TWO WAYFARERS CAME WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE TOWN THE CHILDREN OF THE PURITANS LOOKED UP FROM THEIR PLAY,--OR WHAT PASSED FOR PLAY WITH THOSE SOMBRE LITTLE URCHINS--AND SPOKE GRAVELY ONE TO ANOTHER
HE BEING GONE SHE SUMMONED BACK HER CHILD
SHE ASSUMED A FREEDOM OF SPECULATION THEN COMMON ENOUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC BUT WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS HAD THEY KNOWN IT WOULD HAVE HELD TO BE A DEADLIER CRIME THAN THAT STIGMATISED BY THE SCARLET LETTER
THEY HAVE LONG DWELT TOGETHER NOTHING FURTHER PASSED BETWEEN THE MARINER AND HESTER PRYNNE
NEXT ROSE BEFORE HER IN MEMORY'S PICTURE-GALLERY THE INTRICATE AND NARROW THOROUGHFARES THE TALL GREY HOUSES THE HUGE CATHEDRALS AND THE PUBLIC EDIFICES ANCIENT IN DATE AND QUAINT IN ARCHITECTURE OF A CONTINENTAL CITY
LOOKING DAILY AT YOU MY GOOD SIR AND WATCHING THE TOKENS OF YOUR ASPECT NOW FOR MONTHS GONE BY I SHOULD DEEM YOU A MAN SORE SICK IT MAY BE YET NOT SO SICK BUT THAT AN INSTRUCTED AND WATCHFUL PHYSICIAN MIGHT WELL HOPE TO CURE YOU
IT IS NOT SO
HIS FAME THOUGH STILL ON ITS UPWARD SLOPE ALREADY OVERSHADOWED THE SOBERER REPUTATIONS OF HIS FELLOW-CLERGYMEN EMINENT AS SEVERAL OF THEM WERE
I SEEM TO HAVE A STRONGER CLAIM TO A RESIDENCE HERE ON ACCOUNT OF THIS GRAVE BEARDED SABLE-CLOAKED AND STEEPLE-CROWNED PROGENITOR--WHO CAME SO EARLY WITH HIS BIBLE AND HIS SWORD AND TRODE THE UNWORN STREET WITH SUCH A STATELY PORT AND MADE SO LARGE A FIGURE AS A MAN OF WAR AND PEACE--A STRONGER CLAIM THAN FOR MYSELF WHOSE NAME IS SELDOM HEARD AND MY FACE HARDLY KNOWN
GOD GAVE ME THE CHILD CRIED SHE
THOU MAYEST CONCEAL IT TOO FROM THE MINISTERS AND MAGISTRATES EVEN AS THOU DIDST THIS DAY WHEN THEY SOUGHT TO WRENCH THE NAME OUT OF THY HEART AND GIVE THEE A PARTNER ON THY PEDESTAL
YET PEARL TWICE IN HER LITTLE LIFETIME HATH BEEN KIND TO ME
THERE WILL BE A MERRY COMPANY IN THE FOREST
SHE NEVER CREATED A FRIEND BUT SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE SOWING BROADCAST THE DRAGON'S TEETH WHENCE SPRUNG A HARVEST OF ARMED ENEMIES AGAINST WHOM SHE RUSHED TO BATTLE
YOUR SIN IS LEFT BEHIND YOU IN THE DAYS LONG PAST
PEARL SAID SHE SADLY LOOK DOWN AT THY FEET
NOT SELDOM IT HAD BEEN SEEN BY MULTITUDES
HIS MORAL FORCE WAS ABASED INTO MORE THAN CHILDISH WEAKNESS
IT IS SCARCELY DECOROUS HOWEVER TO SPEAK ALL EVEN WHERE WE SPEAK IMPERSONALLY
IF NOT FOR HIS SAKE THEN DOUBLY FOR THINE OWN
YET THE TASTE OF THE AGE DEMANDING WHATEVER WAS ELABORATE IN COMPOSITIONS OF THIS KIND DID NOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE OVER OUR STERN PROGENITORS WHO HAD CAST BEHIND THEM SO MANY FASHIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SEEM HARDER TO DISPENSE WITH
AND WHETHER IT WERE HIS FAILING HEALTH OR WHATEVER THE CAUSE MIGHT BE HIS LARGE DARK EYES HAD A WORLD OF PAIN IN THEIR TROUBLED AND MELANCHOLY DEPTH
SMILING AT HER MOTHER WITH THE ELFISH INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS SO FAMILIAR AN EXPRESSION ON HER SMALL PHYSIOGNOMY
THE ENERGY--OR SAY RATHER THE INSPIRATION WHICH HAD HELD HIM UP UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE DELIVERED THE SACRED MESSAGE THAT HAD BROUGHT ITS OWN STRENGTH ALONG WITH IT FROM HEAVEN--WAS WITHDRAWN NOW THAT IT HAD SO FAITHFULLY PERFORMED ITS OFFICE
THE LEECH CHAPTER X
IN THIS MANNER THE MYSTERIOUS OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH BECAME THE MEDICAL ADVISER OF THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE
THE PASTOR AND HIS PARISHIONER CHAPTER XVIII
AND HESTER PRYNNE HAD RETURNED AND TAKEN UP HER LONG-FORSAKEN SHAME
THEY SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ALSO ASLEEP IN THEIR ACCUSTOMED CORNERS WITH THEIR CHAIRS TILTED BACK AGAINST THE WALLS
THE PEOPLE POSSESSED BY HEREDITARY RIGHT THE QUALITY OF REVERENCE WHICH IN THEIR DESCENDANTS IF IT SURVIVE AT ALL EXISTS IN SMALLER PROPORTION AND WITH A VASTLY DIMINISHED FORCE IN THE SELECTION AND ESTIMATE OF PUBLIC MEN
NOR DOES NATURE ADORN THE HUMAN RUIN WITH BLOSSOMS OF NEW BEAUTY THAT HAVE THEIR ROOTS AND PROPER NUTRIMENT ONLY IN THE CHINKS AND CREVICES OF DECAY AS SHE SOWS WALL-FLOWERS OVER THE RUINED FORTRESS OF TICONDEROGA
TOMORROW WOULD BRING ITS OWN TRIAL WITH IT
WHY SHOULD HE WORK FOR HIS LIVING HERE OR GO TO DIG GOLD IN CALIFORNIA WHEN HE IS SO SOON TO BE MADE HAPPY AT MONTHLY INTERVALS WITH A LITTLE PILE OF GLITTERING COIN OUT OF HIS UNCLE'S POCKET
IN PURSUANCE OF THIS RESOLVE HE TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE IN THE PURITAN TOWN AS ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WITHOUT OTHER INTRODUCTION THAN THE LEARNING AND INTELLIGENCE OF WHICH HE POSSESSED MORE THAN A COMMON MEASURE
HE NOW LEFT HIS OWN PLACE IN THE PROCESSION AND ADVANCED TO GIVE ASSISTANCE JUDGING FROM MR DIMMESDALE'S ASPECT THAT HE MUST OTHERWISE INEVITABLY FALL
ANOTHER VIEW OF HESTER CHAPTER XIV
LIKE ALL OTHER JOYS SHE REJECTED IT AS SIN
IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF MY MEDITATIONS FOR MANY AN HOUR WHILE PACING TO AND FRO ACROSS MY ROOM OR TRAVERSING WITH A HUNDREDFOLD REPETITION THE LONG EXTENT FROM THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE TO THE SIDE ENTRANCE AND BACK AGAIN
A SECRET ENEMY HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY BY HIS SIDE UNDER THE SEMBLANCE OF A FRIEND AND HELPER AND HAD AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THUS AFFORDED FOR TAMPERING WITH THE DELICATE SPRINGS OF MR DIMMESDALE'S NATURE
NO AIM THAT I HAVE EVER CHERISHED WOULD THEY RECOGNISE AS LAUDABLE
NOR DID IT QUIT ME WHEN LATE AT NIGHT I SAT IN THE DESERTED PARLOUR LIGHTED ONLY BY THE GLIMMERING COAL-FIRE AND THE MOON STRIVING TO PICTURE FORTH IMAGINARY SCENES WHICH THE NEXT DAY MIGHT FLOW OUT ON THE BRIGHTENING PAGE IN MANY-HUED DESCRIPTION
AT LENGTH SHE SUCCEEDED
IT WAS MISTRESS HIBBINS WHO ARRAYED IN GREAT MAGNIFICENCE WITH A TRIPLE RUFF A BROIDERED STOMACHER A GOWN OF RICH VELVET AND A GOLD-HEADED CANE HAD COME FORTH TO SEE THE PROCESSION
HE WAS INDEED THE CUSTOM-HOUSE IN HIMSELF
A FLOOD OF SUNSHINE ARTHUR DIMMESDALE GAZED INTO HESTER'S FACE WITH A LOOK IN WHICH HOPE AND JOY SHONE OUT INDEED BUT WITH FEAR BETWIXT THEM AND A KIND OF HORROR AT HER BOLDNESS WHO HAD SPOKEN WHAT HE VAGUELY HINTED AT BUT DARED NOT SPEAK
NO LONGER AGO THAN YESTER-EVE A MAGISTRATE A WISE AND GODLY MAN WAS DISCOURSING OF YOUR AFFAIRS MISTRESS HESTER AND WHISPERED ME THAT THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION CONCERNING YOU IN THE COUNCIL
FOOLISH CHILD WHAT A QUESTION IS THAT EXCLAIMED HER MOTHER
HE WAS A PERSON OF VERY STRIKING ASPECT WITH A WHITE LOFTY AND IMPENDING BROW
THE GOVERNOR IS COMING AND GENTLEMEN ALONG WITH HIM IN FACT ADOWN THE VISTA OF THE GARDEN AVENUE A NUMBER OF PERSONS WERE SEEN APPROACHING TOWARDS THE HOUSE
BUT YOU MAY SIT DOWN IF YOU WILL TELL ME A STORY MEANWHILE A STORY CHILD SAID HESTER
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO BY A LIGHT AIRY CHILDISH LAUGH IN WHICH WITH A THRILL OF THE HEART--BUT HE KNEW NOT WHETHER OF EXQUISITE PAIN OR PLEASURE AS ACUTE--HE RECOGNISED THE TONES OF LITTLE PEARL
NOT SCORNED AS SHE IS NOW BY HER OWN MERCHANTS AND SHIP-OWNERS WHO PERMIT HER WHARVES TO CRUMBLE TO RUIN WHILE THEIR VENTURES GO TO SWELL NEEDLESSLY AND IMPERCEPTIBLY THE MIGHTY FLOOD OF COMMERCE AT NEW YORK OR BOSTON
IT WAS AN AGE IN WHICH THE HUMAN INTELLECT NEWLY EMANCIPATED HAD TAKEN A MORE ACTIVE AND A WIDER RANGE THAN FOR MANY CENTURIES BEFORE
HESTER PRYNNE SAID THE CLERGYMAN I HAVE STRIVEN WITH MY YOUNG BROTHER HERE UNDER WHOSE PREACHING OF THE WORD YOU HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SIT"--HERE MR WILSON LAID HIS HAND ON THE SHOULDER OF A PALE YOUNG MAN BESIDE HIM--"I HAVE SOUGHT I SAY TO PERSUADE THIS GODLY YOUTH THAT HE SHOULD DEAL WITH YOU HERE IN THE FACE OF HEAVEN AND BEFORE THESE WISE AND UPRIGHT RULERS AND IN HEARING OF ALL THE PEOPLE AS TOUCHING THE VILENESS AND BLACKNESS OF YOUR SIN
IT APPEARS TO ME--WHO HAVE BEEN A CALM AND CURIOUS OBSERVER AS WELL IN VICTORY AS DEFEAT--THAT THIS FIERCE AND BITTER SPIRIT OF MALICE AND REVENGE HAS NEVER DISTINGUISHED THE MANY TRIUMPHS OF MY OWN PARTY AS IT NOW DID THAT OF THE WHIGS
THE PROFOUND DEPTH OF THE MINISTER'S REPOSE WAS THE MORE REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE SLEEP ORDINARILY IS AS LIGHT AS FITFUL AND AS EASILY SCARED AWAY AS A SMALL BIRD HOPPING ON A TWIG
AND SO--AS HAS BEEN THE CUSTOM OF MANKIND EVER SINCE A NATION WAS FIRST GATHERED--THEY MAKE MERRY AND REJOICE
THE FATHER OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE--THE PATRIARCH NOT ONLY OF THIS LITTLE SQUAD OF OFFICIALS BUT I AM BOLD TO SAY OF THE RESPECTABLE BODY OF TIDE-WAITERS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES--WAS A CERTAIN PERMANENT INSPECTOR
THEN THERE IS THE BROAD PATHWAY OF THE SEA CONTINUED HESTER
WILL NOT IT COME OF ITS OWN ACCORD WHEN I AM A WOMAN GROWN RUN AWAY CHILD ANSWERED HER MOTHER AND CATCH THE SUNSHINE
YET NOT ALTOGETHER WORTHLESS PERHAPS AS MATERIALS OF LOCAL HISTORY
THEREFORE AS A MAN WHO HAS NOT THOUGHT AND PHILOSOPHISED IN VAIN I SEEK NO VENGEANCE PLOT NO EVIL AGAINST THEE
TO THE HIGH MOUNTAIN PEAKS OF FAITH AND SANCTITY HE WOULD HAVE CLIMBED HAD NOT THE TENDENCY BEEN THWARTED BY THE BURDEN WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OF CRIME OR ANGUISH BENEATH WHICH IT WAS HIS DOOM TO TOTTER
IS IT THOU
A MYSTIC SHADOW OF SUSPICION IMMEDIATELY ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE SPOT
ARTHUR DIMMESDALE SHE SAID FAINTLY AT FIRST THEN LOUDER BUT HOARSELY--"ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WHO SPEAKS ANSWERED THE MINISTER
EVER AND ANON TOO THERE CAME A GLARE OF RED LIGHT OUT OF HIS EYES AS IF THE OLD MAN'S SOUL WERE ON FIRE AND KEPT ON SMOULDERING DUSKILY WITHIN HIS BREAST UNTIL BY SOME CASUAL PUFF OF PASSION IT WAS BLOWN INTO A MOMENTARY FLAME
AN UNVARIED PALL OF CLOUD MUFFLED THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF SKY FROM ZENITH TO HORIZON
IT IS SINGULAR NEVERTHELESS THAT CERTAIN PERSONS WHO WERE SPECTATORS OF THE WHOLE SCENE AND PROFESSED NEVER ONCE TO HAVE REMOVED THEIR EYES FROM THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE DENIED THAT THERE WAS ANY MARK WHATEVER ON HIS BREAST MORE THAN ON A NEW-BORN INFANT'S
ATTACHING HIMSELF STRONGLY TO FAMILIAR FACES AND WITH DIFFICULTY MOVED TO CHANGE EVEN WHEN CHANGE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT UNQUESTIONABLE IMPROVEMENT
COME THOU AND TAKE IT UP ANSWERED PEARL
SO MUCH BEING KNOWN IT WOULD APPEAR NATURAL THAT A PART OF IT SHOULD BE EXPRESSED
WOMEN MORE ESPECIALLY--IN THE CONTINUALLY RECURRING TRIALS OF WOUNDED WASTED WRONGED MISPLACED OR ERRING AND SINFUL PASSION--OR WITH THE DREARY BURDEN OF A HEART UNYIELDED BECAUSE UNVALUED AND UNSOUGHT CAME TO HESTER'S COTTAGE DEMANDING WHY THEY WERE SO WRETCHED AND WHAT THE REMEDY
IT MAY BE HOWEVER--OH TRANSPORTING AND TRIUMPHANT THOUGHT--THAT THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN OF THE PRESENT RACE MAY SOMETIMES THINK KINDLY OF THE SCRIBBLER OF BYGONE DAYS WHEN THE ANTIQUARY OF DAYS TO COME AMONG THE SITES MEMORABLE IN THE TOWN'S HISTORY SHALL POINT OUT THE LOCALITY OF THE TOWN PUMP
SUCH WAS THE RUIN TO WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MAN ONCE--NAY WHY SHOULD WE NOT SPEAK IT?--STILL SO PASSIONATELY LOVED
THEY CAME STRUTTING OUT OF HIS LUNGS LIKE THE CROW OF A COCK OR THE BLAST OF A CLARION
I MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AFFIRMING THAT IN THE DRESSING UP OF THE TALE AND IMAGINING THE MOTIVES AND MODES OF PASSION THAT INFLUENCED THE CHARACTERS WHO FIGURE IN IT I HAVE INVARIABLY CONFINED MYSELF WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE OLD SURVEYOR'S HALF-A-DOZEN SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP
THEY TALKED MUCH ON BOTH SIDES OF MATTERS THAT SEEMED PERSONAL TO THEMSELVES
HESTER AT HER NEEDLE HESTER PRYNNE'S TERM OF CONFINEMENT WAS NOW AT AN END
HATH HE NOT PLEADED WELL FOR THE POOR WOMAN INDEED HATH HE ANSWERED THE MAGISTRATE
WHAT EVIL THING IS AT HAND WOULD HESTER SAY TO HERSELF
A NEW LIFE BUT FEEDING ITSELF ON TIME-WORN MATERIALS LIKE A TUFT OF GREEN MOSS ON A CRUMBLING WALL
THIS LATTER STEP HOWEVER THERE WAS NO PRESENT PROSPECT THAT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WOULD BE PREVAILED UPON TO TAKE
THE SCARLET LETTER BURNED ON HESTER PRYNNE'S BOSOM
PEARL STILL POINTED WITH HER FOREFINGER AND A FROWN GATHERED ON HER BROW--THE MORE IMPRESSIVE FROM THE CHILDISH THE ALMOST BABY-LIKE ASPECT OF THE FEATURES THAT CONVEYED IT
GO SEEK YOUR MINISTER AND SEE IF HIS EMACIATED FIGURE HIS THIN CHEEK HIS WHITE HEAVY PAIN-WRINKLED BROW BE NOT FLUNG DOWN THERE LIKE A CAST-OFF GARMENT HIS FRIENDS NO DOUBT WOULD STILL HAVE INSISTED WITH HIM--"THOU ART THYSELF THE MAN BUT THE ERROR WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR OWN NOT HIS
SHE SAW HER FATHER'S FACE WITH ITS BOLD BROW AND REVEREND WHITE BEARD THAT FLOWED OVER THE OLD-FASHIONED ELIZABETHAN RUFF
RECOGNISE ME NOT BY WORD BY SIGN BY LOOK
HESTER GAZED AFTER HIM A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING WITH A HALF FANTASTIC CURIOSITY TO SEE WHETHER THE TENDER GRASS OF EARLY SPRING WOULD NOT BE BLIGHTED BENEATH HIM AND SHOW THE WAVERING TRACK OF HIS FOOTSTEPS SERE AND BROWN ACROSS ITS CHEERFUL VERDURE
WE ARE NOT HESTER THE WORST SINNERS IN THE WORLD
CHILDREN TOO YOUNG TO COMPREHEND WHEREFORE THIS WOMAN SHOULD BE SHUT OUT FROM THE SPHERE OF HUMAN CHARITIES WOULD CREEP NIGH ENOUGH TO BEHOLD HER PLYING HER NEEDLE AT THE COTTAGE-WINDOW OR STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OR LABOURING IN HER LITTLE GARDEN OR COMING FORTH ALONG THE PATHWAY THAT LED TOWNWARD AND DISCERNING THE SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST WOULD SCAMPER OFF WITH A STRANGE CONTAGIOUS FEAR
BUT THIS COULD NEVER BE
OF PENANCE I HAVE HAD ENOUGH
THIS MAN SAID HE AT ONE SUCH MOMENT TO HIMSELF PURE AS THEY DEEM HIM--ALL SPIRITUAL AS HE SEEMS--HATH INHERITED A STRONG ANIMAL NATURE FROM HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER
WHILE THUS SUFFERING UNDER BODILY DISEASE AND GNAWED AND TORTURED BY SOME BLACK TROUBLE OF THE SOUL AND GIVEN OVER TO THE MACHINATIONS OF HIS DEADLIEST ENEMY THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE HAD ACHIEVED A BRILLIANT POPULARITY IN HIS SACRED OFFICE
THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES 1851
LONG ENOUGH AND TOO LONG TO HAVE LIVED IN AN UNNATURAL STATE DOING WHAT WAS REALLY OF NO ADVANTAGE NOR DELIGHT TO ANY HUMAN BEING AND WITHHOLDING MYSELF FROM TOIL THAT WOULD AT LEAST HAVE STILLED AN UNQUIET IMPULSE IN ME
THEY DEEMED THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN A MIRACLE OF HOLINESS
SO THAT HIS HEART VIBRATED IN UNISON WITH THEIRS AND RECEIVED THEIR PAIN INTO ITSELF AND SENT ITS OWN THROB OF PAIN THROUGH A THOUSAND OTHER HEARTS IN GUSHES OF SAD PERSUASIVE ELOQUENCE
BUT WILT THOU PROMISE ASKED PEARL TO TAKE MY HAND AND MOTHER'S HAND TO-MORROW NOONTIDE NOT THEN PEARL SAID THE MINISTER
I LEFT HIM YONDER IN THE FOREST WITHDRAWN INTO A SECRET DELL BY A MOSSY TREE TRUNK AND NEAR A MELANCHOLY BROOK
BETIMES THEREFORE THE NEXT DAY HESTER TOOK LITTLE PEARL--WHO WAS NECESSARILY THE COMPANION OF ALL HER MOTHER'S EXPEDITIONS HOWEVER INCONVENIENT HER PRESENCE--AND SET FORTH
HE HAD BEEN THE HUSBAND OF THREE WIVES ALL LONG SINCE DEAD
IN THAT OLD DAY THE ENGLISH SETTLER ON THESE RUDE SHORES--HAVING LEFT KING NOBLES AND ALL DEGREES OF AWFUL RANK BEHIND WHILE STILL THE FACULTY AND NECESSITY OF REVERENCE WAS STRONG IN HIM--BESTOWED IT ON THE WHITE HAIR AND VENERABLE BROW OF AGE--ON LONG-TRIED INTEGRITY--ON SOLID WISDOM AND SAD-COLOURED EXPERIENCE--ON ENDOWMENTS OF THAT GRAVE AND WEIGHTY ORDER WHICH GAVE THE IDEA OF PERMANENCE AND COMES UNDER THE GENERAL DEFINITION OF RESPECTABILITY
THEREFORE IT IS GOOD FOR THIS POOR SINFUL WOMAN THAT SHE HATH AN INFANT IMMORTALITY A BEING CAPABLE OF ETERNAL JOY OR SORROW CONFIDED TO HER CARE--TO BE TRAINED UP BY HER TO RIGHTEOUSNESS TO REMIND HER AT EVERY MOMENT OF HER FALL BUT YET TO TEACH HER AS IF IT WERE BY THE CREATOR'S SACRED PLEDGE THAT IF SHE BRING THE CHILD TO HEAVEN THE CHILD ALSO WILL BRING ITS PARENTS THITHER
AS THE LAST TOUCH TO HER MERMAID'S GARB PEARL TOOK SOME EEL-GRASS AND IMITATED AS BEST SHE COULD ON HER OWN BOSOM THE DECORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS SO FAMILIAR ON HER MOTHER'S
MEN CALL ME WISE
AS CONCERNED HER OWN INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE SHE HAD LONG AGO DECIDED IN THE NEGATIVE AND DISMISSED THE POINT AS SETTLED
IT MIGHT BE THE EXHILARATION OF THAT POTENT CORDIAL WHICH IS DISTILLED ONLY IN THE FURNACE-GLOW OF EARNEST AND LONG-CONTINUED THOUGHT
SHE THRUST FORTH HER HEAD FROM THE LATTICE AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY UPWARD
SHE DOUBTED NOT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH--THE SECRET POISON OF HIS MALIGNITY INFECTING ALL THE AIR ABOUT HIM--AND HIS AUTHORISED INTERFERENCE AS A PHYSICIAN WITH THE MINISTER'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL INFIRMITIES--THAT THESE BAD OPPORTUNITIES HAD BEEN TURNED TO A CRUEL PURPOSE
ABOVE ALL THE WARFARE OF HESTER'S SPIRIT AT THAT EPOCH WAS PERPETUATED IN PEARL
COME UP HITHER ONCE AGAIN AND WE WILL STAND ALL THREE TOGETHER SHE SILENTLY ASCENDED THE STEPS AND STOOD ON THE PLATFORM HOLDING LITTLE PEARL BY THE HAND
AND LIKEWISE A TABLE IN THE SAME TASTE THE WHOLE BEING OF THE ELIZABETHAN AGE OR PERHAPS EARLIER AND HEIRLOOMS TRANSFERRED HITHER FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PATERNAL HOME
THINK FOR ME HESTER
FINDING IT AS IMPOSSIBLE TO TOUCH HER AS TO CATCH A HUMMING-BIRD IN THE AIR HE TOOK FROM HIS HAT THE GOLD CHAIN THAT WAS TWISTED ABOUT IT AND THREW IT TO THE CHILD
BUT AS RESPECTS THE MAJORITY OF MY CORPS OF VETERANS THERE WILL BE NO WRONG DONE IF I CHARACTERIZE THEM GENERALLY AS A SET OF WEARISOME OLD SOULS WHO HAD GATHERED NOTHING WORTH PRESERVATION FROM THEIR VARIED EXPERIENCE OF LIFE
OTHER FACES THAN WERE LOWERING UPON HER FROM BENEATH THE BRIMS OF THOSE STEEPLE-CROWNED HATS
WITH THE CUSTOMARY INFIRMITY OF TEMPER THAT CHARACTERIZES THIS UNHAPPY FOWL SHE APPEARS BY THE FIERCENESS OF HER BEAK AND EYE AND THE GENERAL TRUCULENCY OF HER ATTITUDE TO THREATEN MISCHIEF TO THE INOFFENSIVE COMMUNITY
IF THOU HADST A SORROW OF THINE OWN THE BROOK MIGHT TELL THEE OF IT ANSWERED HER MOTHER EVEN AS IT IS TELLING ME OF MINE
HERE STRIVEN TO PRAY
AT ONE EXTREMITY THIS SPACIOUS ROOM WAS LIGHTED BY THE WINDOWS OF THE TWO TOWERS WHICH FORMED A SMALL RECESS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PORTAL
EACH ITS OWN TRIAL AND YET THE VERY SAME THAT WAS NOW SO UNUTTERABLY GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
THE BOUGHS WERE TOSSING HEAVILY ABOVE THEIR HEADS
I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE MAN TO WHOSE INNATE KINDLINESS I WOULD MORE CONFIDENTLY MAKE AN APPEAL
WERE THERE NOT THE BRILLIANT PARTICLES OF A HALO IN THE AIR ABOUT HIS HEAD
THE SOFA
IT WAS ALREADY THRONGED WITH THE CRAFTSMEN AND OTHER PLEBEIAN INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS AMONG WHOM LIKEWISE WERE MANY ROUGH FIGURES WHOSE ATTIRE OF DEER-SKINS MARKED THEM AS BELONGING TO SOME OF THE FOREST SETTLEMENTS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LITTLE METROPOLIS OF THE COLONY
HENCEFORTH IT CEASES TO BE A REALITY OF MY LIFE
AT ABOUT THE CENTRE OF THE OAKEN PANELS THAT LINED THE HALL WAS SUSPENDED A SUIT OF MAIL NOT LIKE THE PICTURES AN ANCESTRAL RELIC BUT OF THE MOST MODERN DATE
THE OLD INSPECTOR--WHO BY-THE-BYE I REGRET TO SAY WAS OVERTHROWN AND KILLED BY A HORSE SOME TIME AGO ELSE HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LIVED FOR EVER--HE AND ALL THOSE OTHER VENERABLE PERSONAGES WHO SAT WITH HIM AT THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOM ARE BUT SHADOWS IN MY VIEW
HER MIND AND ESPECIALLY HER MEMORY WAS PRETERNATURALLY ACTIVE AND KEPT BRINGING UP OTHER SCENES THAN THIS ROUGHLY HEWN STREET OF A LITTLE TOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE WESTERN WILDERNESS
AGED PERSONS ALIVE IN THE TIME OF MR SURVEYOR PUE AND FROM WHOSE ORAL TESTIMONY HE HAD MADE UP HIS NARRATIVE REMEMBERED HER IN THEIR YOUTH AS A VERY OLD BUT NOT DECREPIT WOMAN OF A STATELY AND SOLEMN ASPECT
NOT THAT THE SURVEYOR BROUGHT THE LESSON HOME TO HIMSELF OR ADMITTED THAT HE COULD BE SO UTTERLY UNDONE EITHER BY CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE OR EJECTMENT
IT WAS AS IF AN ANGEL IN HIS PASSAGE TO THE SKIES HAD SHAKEN HIS BRIGHT WINGS OVER THE PEOPLE FOR AN INSTANT--AT ONCE A SHADOW AND A SPLENDOUR--AND HAD SHED DOWN A SHOWER OF GOLDEN TRUTHS UPON THEM
EVEN THUS EARLY HAD THE CHILD SAVED HER FROM SATAN'S SNARE
HAD SHE GATHERED PEARLS AND DIAMONDS AND RUBIES IN THE WOOD THEY COULD NOT HAVE BECOME HER BETTER
THE GARDEN-PLOTS BLACK WITH FRESHLY-TURNED EARTH
BY AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT EACH LIMB PROVED TO BE PRECISELY THREE INCHES AND A QUARTER IN LENGTH
GATHERING HIMSELF QUICKLY UP HE STOOD MORE ERECT LIKE A MAN TAKEN BY SURPRISE IN A MOOD TO WHICH HE WAS RELUCTANT TO HAVE WITNESSES
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE OCCASIONS WHEN THE HABIT OF BYGONE DAYS AWOKE IN ME WAS THAT WHICH BRINGS IT WITHIN THE LAW OF LITERARY PROPRIETY TO OFFER THE PUBLIC THE SKETCH WHICH I AM NOW WRITING
NOR IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO REFLECT DID THE TRUTH AS IT CAME HOME TO MY PERCEPTION EVER COST ME A PANG OR REQUIRE TO BE THROWN OFF IN A SIGH
THE MOTHERLY CARE OF THE GOOD WIDOW ASSIGNED TO MR DIMMESDALE A FRONT APARTMENT WITH A SUNNY EXPOSURE AND HEAVY WINDOW-CURTAINS TO CREATE A NOONTIDE SHADOW WHEN DESIRABLE
BUT IT IS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE TO A MAN OF PRIDE AND SENSIBILITY TO KNOW THAT HIS INTERESTS ARE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NEITHER LOVE NOR UNDERSTAND HIM AND BY WHOM SINCE ONE OR THE OTHER MUST NEEDS HAPPEN HE WOULD RATHER BE INJURED THAN OBLIGED
FANSHAWE PUBLISHED ANONYMOUSLY 1826
AND AS SUCH AN OCCASION FORMED AN HONOURABLE EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF A NEW ENGLAND CLERGYMAN HE COULD NOT HAVE CHANCED UPON A MORE SUITABLE MODE AND TIME OF TERMINATING HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER
SUCH OCCASIONS MIGHT REMIND THE ELDERLY CITIZEN OF THAT PERIOD BEFORE THE LAST WAR WITH ENGLAND WHEN SALEM WAS A PORT BY ITSELF
THE INFANT DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF HER ORDEAL PIERCED THE AIR WITH ITS WAILINGS AND SCREAMS
SUCH WAS THE YOUNG MAN WHOM THE REVEREND MR WILSON AND THE GOVERNOR HAD INTRODUCED SO OPENLY TO THE PUBLIC NOTICE BIDDING HIM SPEAK IN THE HEARING OF ALL MEN TO THAT MYSTERY OF A WOMAN'S SOUL SO SACRED EVEN IN ITS POLLUTION
A DREARY LOOK-FORWARD THIS FOR A MAN WHO FELT IT TO BE THE BEST DEFINITION OF HAPPINESS TO LIVE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS FACULTIES AND SENSIBILITIES
THE POINT HATH BEEN WEIGHTILY DISCUSSED WHETHER WE THAT ARE OF AUTHORITY AND INFLUENCE DO WELL DISCHARGE OUR CONSCIENCES BY TRUSTING AN IMMORTAL SOUL SUCH AS THERE IS IN YONDER CHILD TO THE GUIDANCE OF ONE WHO HATH STUMBLED AND FALLEN AMID THE PITFALLS OF THIS WORLD
NEVER DID MORTAL SUFFER WHAT THIS MAN HAS SUFFERED
MR DIMMESDALE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO MAKE A PRAYER SHE LEARNT THAT HE HAD GONE THE DAY BEFORE TO VISIT THE APOSTLE ELIOT AMONG HIS INDIAN CONVERTS
IT WAS TO TEACH THEM THAT THE HOLIEST AMONGST US HAS BUT ATTAINED SO FAR ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AS TO DISCERN MORE CLEARLY THE MERCY WHICH LOOKS DOWN AND REPUDIATE MORE UTTERLY THE PHANTOM OF HUMAN MERIT WHICH WOULD LOOK ASPIRINGLY UPWARD
IT WAS ON HIM HE CONTINUED WITH A KIND OF FIERCENESS
THE REAL HUMAN BEING ALL THIS TIME WITH HIS HEAD SAFELY ON HIS SHOULDERS HAD BROUGHT HIMSELF TO THE COMFORTABLE CONCLUSION THAT EVERYTHING WAS FOR THE BEST
AGAIN AS IF HER MOTHER'S AGONISED GESTURE WERE MEANT ONLY TO MAKE SPORT FOR HER DID LITTLE PEARL LOOK INTO HER EYES AND SMILE
I HAD CEASED TO BE A WRITER OF TOLERABLY POOR TALES AND ESSAYS AND HAD BECOME A TOLERABLY GOOD SURVEYOR OF THE CUSTOMS
BUT ONCE STIRRED UP WITH OBSTACLES TO OVERCOME AND AN ADEQUATE OBJECT TO BE ATTAINED IT WAS NOT IN THE MAN TO GIVE OUT OR FAIL
IN VIEW OF MY PREVIOUS WEARINESS OF OFFICE AND VAGUE THOUGHTS OF RESIGNATION MY FORTUNE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED THAT OF A PERSON WHO SHOULD ENTERTAIN AN IDEA OF COMMITTING SUICIDE AND ALTHOUGH BEYOND HIS HOPES MEET WITH THE GOOD HAP TO BE MURDERED
WHAT MEAN YOU HESTER PRYNNE WAS NOW FULLY SENSIBLE OF THE DEEP INJURY FOR WHICH SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE TO THIS UNHAPPY MAN IN PERMITTING HIM TO LIE FOR SO MANY YEARS OR INDEED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT AT THE MERCY OF ONE WHOSE PURPOSES COULD NOT BE OTHER THAN MALEVOLENT
SO MISTRESS SAID THE MARINER I MUST BID THE STEWARD MAKE READY ONE MORE BERTH THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR
HE HAD BEEN DRIVEN HITHER BY THE IMPULSE OF THAT REMORSE WHICH DOGGED HIM EVERYWHERE AND WHOSE OWN SISTER AND CLOSELY LINKED COMPANION WAS THAT COWARDICE WHICH INVARIABLY DREW HIM BACK WITH HER TREMULOUS GRIPE JUST WHEN THE OTHER IMPULSE HAD HURRIED HIM TO THE VERGE OF A DISCLOSURE
THE CHILD AT THE BROOKSIDE THOU WILT LOVE HER DEARLY REPEATED HESTER PRYNNE AS SHE AND THE MINISTER SAT WATCHING LITTLE PEARL
THIS IDEA WAS COUNTENANCED BY THE STRONG INTEREST WHICH THE PHYSICIAN EVER MANIFESTED IN THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN
BUT THEN THE ELF-CHILD SIGHED AND GAVE UP HER SPORT BECAUSE IT GRIEVED HER TO HAVE DONE HARM TO A LITTLE BEING THAT WAS AS WILD AS THE SEA-BREEZE OR AS WILD AS PEARL HERSELF
THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO-EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY
BUT THE MOTHER DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR IT
THE MAGISTRATE AFTER A WARY OBSERVATION OF THE DARKNESS--INTO WHICH NEVERTHELESS HE COULD SEE BUT LITTLE FURTHER THAN HE MIGHT INTO A MILL-STONE--RETIRED FROM THE WINDOW
YEA THOUGH NO LEAF OF THE WILD GARLANDS WHICH THEY WORE WHILE THEY DANCED BE LEFT IN THEIR HAIR
WHEN STRANGERS LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT THE SCARLET LETTER AND NONE EVER FAILED TO DO SO--THEY BRANDED IT AFRESH IN HESTER'S SOUL
FOR I AM IN THE REALM OF QUIET
ACCORDING TO THE RECEIVED CODE IN SUCH MATTERS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF DUTY IN A POLITICIAN TO BRING EVERY ONE OF THOSE WHITE HEADS UNDER THE AXE OF THE GUILLOTINE
THE HELPFUL INMATE HAD DEPARTED WITHOUT ONE BACKWARD GLANCE TO GATHER UP THE MEED OF GRATITUDE IF ANY WERE IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHOM SHE HAD SERVED SO ZEALOUSLY
WHETHER MOVED ONLY BY HER ORDINARY FREAKISHNESS OR BECAUSE AN EVIL SPIRIT PROMPTED HER SHE PUT UP HER SMALL FOREFINGER AND TOUCHED THE SCARLET LETTER
HERE SHE SAID TO HERSELF HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF HER GUILT AND HERE SHOULD BE THE SCENE OF HER EARTHLY PUNISHMENT
THINK NOT NOW OF THE MINISTER BUT LOOK ABOUT THEE AND SEE HOW CHEERY IS EVERYBODY'S FACE TO-DAY
AND GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM GAVE EXPRESSION TO ITS PURPORT SPEAKING IN AN AUTHORITATIVE VOICE ALTHOUGH TEMPERED WITH RESPECT TOWARDS THE YOUTHFUL CLERGYMAN WHOM HE ADDRESSED
WOULD HE STARTLE HIM WITH SUDDEN FEAR
OH HESTER PRYNNE THOU LITTLE LITTLE KNOWEST ALL THE HORROR OF THIS THING
IT WILL GO NOW SAID PEARL SHAKING HER HEAD
THROUGHOUT THEM ALL GIVING UP HER INDIVIDUALITY SHE WOULD BECOME THE GENERAL SYMBOL AT WHICH THE PREACHER AND MORALIST MIGHT POINT AND IN WHICH THEY MIGHT VIVIFY AND EMBODY THEIR IMAGES OF WOMAN'S FRAILTY AND SINFUL PASSION
MAKE WAY GOOD PEOPLE--MAKE WAY IN THE KING'S NAME CRIED HE
SUCH WERE SOME OF THE THOUGHTS THAT NOW STIRRED IN HESTER'S MIND WITH AS MUCH VIVACITY OF IMPRESSION AS IF THEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN WHISPERED INTO HER EAR
HAD A MAN SEEN OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AT THAT MOMENT OF HIS ECSTASY HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO NEED TO ASK HOW SATAN COMPORTS HIMSELF WHEN A PRECIOUS HUMAN SOUL IS LOST TO HEAVEN AND WON INTO HIS KINGDOM
UNTIL HAPPENING TO APPROACH THE SPOT WHERE HESTER PRYNNE WAS STANDING HE APPEARED TO RECOGNISE AND DID NOT HESITATE TO ADDRESS HER
THE PAST IS GONE
HERE WOMAN
IT SEEMED HARDLY THE FACE OF A MAN ALIVE WITH SUCH A DEATH-LIKE HUE
AFTER PARTING FROM THE OLD CHURCH MEMBER HE MET THE YOUNGEST SISTER OF THEM ALL
KNOWING WELL HER PART SHE ASCENDED A FLIGHT OF WOODEN STEPS AND WAS THUS DISPLAYED TO THE SURROUNDING MULTITUDE AT ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A MAN'S SHOULDERS ABOVE THE STREET
WHILE THE MINISTER STOOD WITH A FLUSH OF TRIUMPH IN HIS FACE AS ONE WHO IN THE CRISIS OF ACUTEST PAIN HAD WON A VICTORY
BUT IN VERY TRUTH SHE IS RIGHT AS REGARDS THIS HATEFUL TOKEN
TOO MUCH UNGLADDENED BY GENIAL SUNSHINE
THE PROCESSION BEFORE HESTER PRYNNE COULD CALL TOGETHER HER THOUGHTS AND CONSIDER WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE TO BE DONE IN THIS NEW AND STARTLING ASPECT OF AFFAIRS THE SOUND OF MILITARY MUSIC WAS HEARD APPROACHING ALONG A CONTIGUOUS STREET
AND WHO BY YOUR FAVOUR SIR MAY BE THE FATHER OF YONDER BABE--IT IS SOME THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OLD I SHOULD JUDGE--WHICH MISTRESS PRYNNE IS HOLDING IN HER ARMS OF A TRUTH FRIEND THAT MATTER REMAINETH A RIDDLE
BUT IT MUST NOW BE SAID ANOTHER PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY HAD LATTERLY BEGUN TO TAKE ITS OWN VIEW OF THE RELATION BETWIXT MR DIMMESDALE AND THE MYSTERIOUS OLD PHYSICIAN
HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER--AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY--BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
AS I HAVE SOUGHT GOLD IN ALCHEMY
IT MAY BE WE SHALL SEE FLOWERS THERE
INSTEAD OF A REPRIMAND FOR THEIR PREVIOUS NEGLIGENCE THE CASE SEEMED RATHER TO REQUIRE AN EULOGIUM ON THEIR PRAISEWORTHY CAUTION AFTER THE MISCHIEF HAD HAPPENED
IF TO THESE QUALIFICATIONS OF A CONFIDANT BE JOINED THE ADVANTAGES AFFORDED BY HIS RECOGNISED CHARACTER AS A PHYSICIAN;--THEN AT SOME INEVITABLE MOMENT WILL THE SOUL OF THE SUFFERER BE DISSOLVED AND FLOW FORTH IN A DARK BUT TRANSPARENT STREAM BRINGING ALL ITS MYSTERIES INTO THE DAYLIGHT
STAND YOU HERE AND LET ME RUN AND CATCH IT
BUT THY WORDS INTERPRET THEE AS A TERROR ONE THING THOU THAT WAST MY WIFE I WOULD ENJOIN UPON THEE CONTINUED THE SCHOLAR
SHE HAD FLUNG IT INTO INFINITE SPACE
YOU SEARCH HIS THOUGHTS
NOT SELDOM SHE WOULD LAUGH ANEW AND LOUDER THAN BEFORE LIKE A THING INCAPABLE AND UNINTELLIGENT OF HUMAN SORROW
THOU HAST ESCAPED ME HE REPEATED MORE THAN ONCE
HE SENT US ALL INTO THE WORLD
FOR MANY YEARS THOUGH A VAGUE REPORT WOULD NOW AND THEN FIND ITS WAY ACROSS THE SEA--LIKE A SHAPELESS PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD TOSSED ASHORE WITH THE INITIALS OF A NAME UPON IT--YET NO TIDINGS OF THEM UNQUESTIONABLY AUTHENTIC WERE RECEIVED
AND ALL ALL IN THE SIGHT OF HIS WORST ENEMY
WHO NOW THAT SAW HIM PASS IN THE PROCESSION WOULD THINK HOW LITTLE WHILE IT IS SINCE HE WENT FORTH OUT OF HIS STUDY--CHEWING A HEBREW TEXT OF SCRIPTURE IN HIS MOUTH I WARRANT--TO TAKE AN AIRING IN THE FOREST
THOU WILT NOT REVEAL HIS NAME
THOU HAST TAUGHT ME IN THE HORN-BOOK HESTER LOOKED STEADILY INTO HER LITTLE FACE
THE LATTER IS PERHAPS THE TRUEST THEORY
AND SHOWING HOW SACRED LOVE SHOULD MAKE US HAPPY BY THE TRUEST TEST OF A LIFE SUCCESSFUL TO SUCH AN END
HE KNEW BY SOME SPIRITUAL SENSE--FOR THE CREATOR NEVER MADE ANOTHER BEING SO SENSITIVE AS THIS--HE KNEW THAT NO FRIENDLY HAND WAS PULLING AT HIS HEARTSTRINGS AND THAT AN EYE WAS LOOKING CURIOUSLY INTO HIM WHICH SOUGHT ONLY EVIL AND FOUND IT
OH I HAVE MUCH TO TELL THEE ABOUT HER
IX
SHE COULD HAVE NO FAITH THEREFORE THAT ITS RESULT WOULD BE GOOD
OTHERS AGAIN AND THOSE BEST ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE MINISTER'S PECULIAR SENSIBILITY AND THE WONDERFUL OPERATION OF HIS SPIRIT UPON THE BODY--WHISPERED THEIR BELIEF THAT THE AWFUL SYMBOL WAS THE EFFECT OF THE EVER-ACTIVE TOOTH OF REMORSE GNAWING FROM THE INMOST HEART OUTWARDLY AND AT LAST MANIFESTING HEAVEN'S DREADFUL JUDGMENT BY THE VISIBLE PRESENCE OF THE LETTER
THAT I CANNOT GIVE THEE
SLOWLY--FOR SHE SAW THE CLERGYMAN
THERE ARE SCHOLARS AMONG THEM WHO HAD SPENT MORE YEARS IN ACQUIRING ABSTRUSE LORE CONNECTED WITH THE DIVINE PROFESSION THAN MR DIMMESDALE HAD LIVED
AND SUDDENLY FOR WOMEN IN SOLITUDE AND WITH TROUBLED HEARTS ARE PESTERED WITH UNACCOUNTABLE DELUSIONS SHE FANCIED THAT SHE BEHELD NOT HER OWN MINIATURE PORTRAIT BUT ANOTHER FACE IN THE SMALL BLACK MIRROR OF PEARL'S EYE
TRUTH WAS THE ONE VIRTUE WHICH I MIGHT HAVE HELD FAST AND DID HOLD FAST THROUGH ALL EXTREMITY
NEVER WAS THERE A BLACKER OR A FIERCER FROWN THAN HESTER NOW ENCOUNTERED
MISSHAPEN FROM MY BIRTH-HOUR HOW COULD I DELUDE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT INTELLECTUAL GIFTS MIGHT VEIL PHYSICAL DEFORMITY IN A YOUNG GIRL'S FANTASY
LEAP ACROSS THE BROOK NAUGHTY CHILD AND RUN HITHER
DO THOU TELL ME THY HEAVENLY FATHER SENT THEE ANSWERED HESTER PRYNNE
WILT THOU GO WITH US TO-NIGHT
MORE BY TOKEN AS THERE IS A LOT OF APOTHECARY'S STUFF ABOARD WHICH I TRADED FOR WITH A SPANISH VESSEL WHAT MEAN YOU INQUIRED HESTER STARTLED MORE THAN SHE PERMITTED TO APPEAR
ACT
AND IS THIS HIS MARK WILT THOU LET ME BE AT PEACE IF I ONCE TELL THEE ASKED HER MOTHER
WHEN HE FOUND THE EYES OF HESTER PRYNNE FASTENED ON HIS OWN AND SAW THAT SHE APPEARED TO RECOGNIZE HIM HE SLOWLY AND CALMLY RAISED HIS FINGER MADE A GESTURE WITH IT IN THE AIR AND LAID IT ON HIS LIPS
MANY A CHURCH MEMBER SAW I WALKING BEHIND THE MUSIC THAT HAS DANCED IN THE SAME MEASURE WITH ME WHEN SOMEBODY WAS FIDDLER AND IT MIGHT BE AN INDIAN POWWOW OR A LAPLAND WIZARD CHANGING HANDS WITH US
PEARL THAT WILD AND FLIGHTY LITTLE ELF STOLE SOFTLY TOWARDS HIM AND TAKING HIS HAND IN THE GRASP OF BOTH HER OWN LAID HER CHEEK AGAINST IT
NOR CAN IT BE OTHERWISE THAN THE MAIN CONDITION OF AN INTELLECT SO REMARKABLY CLEAR AND ACCURATE AS HIS TO BE HONEST AND REGULAR IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF AFFAIRS
WHAT COULD HE WHOSE SPHERE WAS IN GREAT CITIES BE SEEKING IN THE WILDERNESS
IT WAS CARELESSLY AT FIRST LIKE A MAN CHIEFLY ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK INWARD AND TO WHOM EXTERNAL MATTERS ARE OF LITTLE VALUE AND IMPORT UNLESS THEY BEAR RELATION TO SOMETHING WITHIN HIS MIND
A MAN BURDENED WITH A SECRET SHOULD ESPECIALLY AVOID THE INTIMACY OF HIS PHYSICIAN
FOR IN THAT BRIEF INTERVAL SHE HAD SINNED ANEW
MIGHT IT NOT IN THE TEDIOUS LAPSE OF OFFICIAL LIFE THAT LAY BEFORE ME FINALLY BE WITH ME AS IT WAS WITH THIS VENERABLE FRIEND--TO MAKE THE DINNER-HOUR THE NUCLEUS OF THE DAY AND TO SPEND THE REST OF IT AS AN OLD DOG SPENDS IT ASLEEP IN THE SUNSHINE OR IN THE SHADE
BUT HOW GAT SUCH A GUEST INTO MY HALL AY INDEED CRIED GOOD OLD MR WILSON
WITH THE SIN-BORN INFANT IN HER ARMS
HE WORE A PROFUSION OF RIBBONS ON HIS GARMENT AND GOLD LACE ON HIS HAT WHICH WAS ALSO ENCIRCLED BY A GOLD CHAIN AND SURMOUNTED WITH A FEATHER
A TIME WHEN THE LIFE OF ENGLAND VIEWED AS ONE GREAT MASS WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN AS STATELY MAGNIFICENT AND JOYOUS AS THE WORLD HAS EVER WITNESSED
SHE HAD DRAWN AN HOUR'S FREE BREATH
IT IS SINGULAR HOWEVER HOW LONG A TIME OFTEN PASSES BEFORE WORDS EMBODY THINGS
VI
A SPELL WAS BROKEN
ASK YONDER OLD MAN WHOM THOU HAST BEEN TALKING WITH,--IT MAY BE HE CAN TELL
IT IMPARTED TO THE WEARER A KIND OF SACREDNESS WHICH ENABLED HER TO WALK SECURELY AMID ALL PERIL
XI
WITH HER MIND HARASSED BY THE TERRIBLE PERPLEXITY IN WHICH THE SHIPMASTER'S INTELLIGENCE INVOLVED HER SHE WAS ALSO SUBJECTED TO ANOTHER TRIAL
FOR HE TELLS ME HE IS OF YOUR PARTY AND A CLOSE FRIEND TO THE GENTLEMAN YOU SPOKE OF--HE THAT IS IN PERIL FROM THESE SOUR OLD PURITAN RULERS THEY KNOW EACH OTHER WELL INDEED REPLIED HESTER WITH A MIEN OF CALMNESS THOUGH IN THE UTMOST CONSTERNATION
HIS FACE DARKENED WITH SOME POWERFUL EMOTION WHICH NEVERTHELESS HE SO INSTANTANEOUSLY CONTROLLED BY AN EFFORT OF HIS WILL THAT SAVE AT A SINGLE MOMENT ITS EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR CALMNESS
HERE INDEED IN THE SABLE SIMPLICITY THAT GENERALLY CHARACTERISED THE PURITANIC MODES OF DRESS THERE MIGHT BE AN INFREQUENT CALL FOR THE FINER PRODUCTIONS OF HER HANDIWORK
AND IN THE NATURE OF THE CHILD SEEMED TO BE PERPETUATED THOSE UNQUIET ELEMENTS THAT HAD DISTRACTED HESTER PRYNNE BEFORE PEARL'S BIRTH BUT HAD SINCE BEGUN TO BE SOOTHED AWAY BY THE SOFTENING INFLUENCES OF MATERNITY
IT THROWS ITS UNOBTRUSIVE TINGE THROUGHOUT THE ROOM WITH A FAINT RUDDINESS UPON THE WALLS AND CEILING AND A REFLECTED GLEAM UPON THE POLISH OF THE FURNITURE
AT HIS ARRIVAL IN THE MARKET-PLACE AND SOME TIME BEFORE SHE SAW HIM THE STRANGER HAD BENT HIS EYES ON HESTER PRYNNE
OR FROM THE MORBID CURIOSITY THAT GIVES A FICTITIOUS VALUE EVEN TO COMMON OR WORTHLESS THINGS
THE OLD MAN ON THE OTHER HAND HAD BROUGHT HIMSELF NEARER TO HER LEVEL OR PERHAPS BELOW IT BY THE REVENGE WHICH HE HAD STOOPED FOR
WERE IT ONLY FOR THE ART'S SAKE I MUST SEARCH THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM IT CAME TO PASS NOT LONG AFTER THE SCENE ABOVE RECORDED THAT THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE NOON-DAY AND ENTIRELY UNAWARES FELL INTO A DEEP DEEP SLUMBER SITTING IN HIS CHAIR WITH A LARGE BLACK-LETTER VOLUME OPEN BEFORE HIM ON THE TABLE
I SAID BUT NOW THAT THERE COULD BE NO GOOD EVENT FOR HIM OR THEE OR ME WHO ARE HERE WANDERING TOGETHER IN THIS GLOOMY MAZE OF EVIL AND STUMBLING AT EVERY STEP OVER THE GUILT WHEREWITH WE HAVE STREWN OUR PATH
AT EVERY STEP HE WAS INCITED TO DO SOME STRANGE WILD WICKED THING OR OTHER WITH A SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE AT ONCE INVOLUNTARY AND INTENTIONAL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF YET GROWING OUT OF A PROFOUNDER SELF THAN THAT WHICH OPPOSED THE IMPULSE
BUT ON EXAMINING THE PAPERS WHICH THE PARCHMENT COMMISSION SERVED TO ENVELOP I FOUND MORE TRACES OF MR PUE'S MENTAL PART AND THE INTERNAL OPERATIONS OF HIS HEAD THAN THE FRIZZLED WIG HAD CONTAINED OF THE VENERABLE SKULL ITSELF
HERE IT WAS WOFULLY VISIBLE IN THIS INTENSE SECLUSION OF THE FOREST WHICH OF ITSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN A HEAVY TRIAL TO THE SPIRITS
THE CROWD MEANWHILE LOOKED ON WITH AWE AND WONDER
INDEED THE SAME DARK QUESTION OFTEN ROSE INTO HER MIND WITH REFERENCE TO THE WHOLE RACE OF WOMANHOOD
HE GAVE HER IN REQUITAL OF ALL THINGS ELSE WHICH YE HAD TAKEN FROM ME
IT MAY BE THAT HIS PATHWAY THROUGH LIFE WAS HAUNTED THUS BY A SPECTRE THAT HAD STOLEN OUT FROM AMONG HIS THOUGHTS
MORE SAINT-LIKE BECAUSE THE RESULT OF MARTYRDOM
IT MIGHT BE THAT HE LIVED A MORE REAL LIFE WITHIN HIS THOUGHTS THAN AMID THE UNAPPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COLLECTOR'S OFFICE
AND LITTLE PEARL HERSELF A SYMBOL AND THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO
HE HATH PROVED HIS MERCY MOST OF ALL IN MY AFFLICTIONS
I REMEMBERED TO HAVE READ PROBABLY IN FELT'S ANNALS A NOTICE OF THE DECEASE OF MR SURVEYOR PUE ABOUT FOURSCORE YEARS AGO
MEETING THEM IN THE STREET SHE NEVER RAISED HER HEAD TO RECEIVE THEIR GREETING
I HATE HIM HESTER SHE REMEMBERED HER OATH AND WAS SILENT
WITHOUT FURTHER ADVENTURE THEY REACHED THE DWELLING OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM
A BODILY DISEASE WHICH WE LOOK UPON AS WHOLE AND ENTIRE WITHIN ITSELF MAY AFTER ALL BE BUT A SYMPTOM OF SOME AILMENT IN THE SPIRITUAL PART
BUT WHERE WAS LITTLE PEARL
NOT MORE BY ITS HUE THAN BY SOME INDESCRIBABLE PECULIARITY IN ITS FASHION IT HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING HER FADE PERSONALLY OUT OF SIGHT AND OUTLINE
IF THEY WERE RESOLUTE TO ACCOST HER SHE LAID HER FINGER ON THE SCARLET LETTER AND PASSED ON
EVEN AS IN ONE WHO AT LAST DRAWS FREE AIR AFTER A LONG STIFLING WITH HIS OWN POLLUTED BREATH
SOME ATTRIBUTE HAD DEPARTED FROM HER THE PERMANENCE OF WHICH HAD BEEN ESSENTIAL TO KEEP HER A WOMAN
STRENGTHENED BY YEARS OF HARD AND SOLEMN TRIAL SHE FELT HERSELF NO LONGER SO INADEQUATE TO COPE WITH ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AS ON THAT NIGHT ABASED BY SIN AND HALF-MADDENED BY THE IGNOMINY THAT WAS STILL NEW WHEN THEY HAD TALKED TOGETHER IN THE PRISON-CHAMBER
IN MY NATIVE TOWN OF SALEM AT THE HEAD OF WHAT HALF A CENTURY AGO IN THE DAYS OF OLD KING DERBY WAS A BUSTLING WHARF--BUT WHICH IS NOW BURDENED WITH DECAYED WOODEN WAREHOUSES AND EXHIBITS FEW OR NO SYMPTOMS OF COMMERCIAL LIFE
HAD THEY TAKEN HER FROM ME I WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE GONE WITH THEE INTO THE FOREST AND SIGNED MY NAME IN THE BLACK MAN'S BOOK TOO AND THAT WITH MINE OWN BLOOD WE SHALL HAVE THEE THERE ANON SAID THE WITCH-LADY FROWNING AS SHE DREW BACK HER HEAD
BUT THERE WAS A QUALITY SO MUCH MORE TERRIBLE IN THE SOLEMN MOOD OF THE POPULAR MIND THAT SHE LONGED RATHER TO BEHOLD ALL THOSE RIGID COUNTENANCES CONTORTED WITH SCORNFUL MERRIMENT AND HERSELF THE OBJECT
HOW DEEPLY HAD THEY KNOWN EACH OTHER THEN
HESTER PRYNNE SAID HE
OR IF THIS BE THE PATH TO A BETTER LIFE AS HESTER WOULD PERSUADE ME I SURELY GIVE UP NO FAIRER PROSPECT BY PURSUING IT
WE SHALL BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANON
AND IT EXCITED NEITHER SURPRISE NOR ANIMADVERSION WHEN SO REPUTABLE A CITIZEN AS OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THE PHYSICIAN WAS SEEN TO ENTER THE MARKET-PLACE IN CLOSE AND FAMILIAR TALK WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE QUESTIONABLE VESSEL
MORE THAN ONCE--NAY MORE THAN A HUNDRED TIMES--HE HAD ACTUALLY SPOKEN
WE HAVE THROWN ALL THE LIGHT WE COULD ACQUIRE UPON THE PORTENT AND WOULD GLADLY NOW THAT IT HAS DONE ITS OFFICE ERASE ITS DEEP PRINT OUT OF OUR OWN BRAIN WHERE LONG MEDITATION HAS FIXED IT IN VERY UNDESIRABLE DISTINCTNESS
SUCH A FRIEND AS THOU HAST EVEN NOW WISHED FOR SAID SHE WITH WHOM TO WEEP OVER THY SIN THOU HAST IN ME THE PARTNER OF IT AGAIN SHE HESITATED BUT BROUGHT OUT THE WORDS WITH AN EFFORT.--"THOU HAST LONG HAD SUCH AN ENEMY AND DWELLEST WITH HIM UNDER THE SAME ROOF THE MINISTER STARTED TO HIS FEET GASPING FOR BREATH AND CLUTCHING AT HIS HEART AS IF HE WOULD HAVE TORN IT OUT OF HIS BOSOM
I SEE WHAT AILS THE CHILD WHISPERED HESTER TO THE CLERGYMAN AND TURNING PALE IN SPITE OF A STRONG EFFORT TO CONCEAL HER TROUBLE AND ANNOYANCE CHILDREN WILL NOT ABIDE ANY THE SLIGHTEST CHANGE IN THE ACCUSTOMED ASPECT OF THINGS THAT ARE DAILY BEFORE THEIR EYES
THIS MIGHT BE PRIDE BUT WAS SO LIKE HUMILITY THAT IT PRODUCED ALL THE SOFTENING INFLUENCE OF THE LATTER QUALITY ON THE PUBLIC MIND
WHAT RIGHT HAD INFIRMITY LIKE HIS TO BURDEN ITSELF WITH CRIME
SHE BARELY LOOKED THE IDEA IN THE FACE AND HASTENED TO BAR IT IN ITS DUNGEON
THE SPOT NEVER GREW CALLOUS
THEN AT SUCH AN HOUR AND WITH THIS SCENE BEFORE HIM IF A MAN SITTING ALL ALONE CANNOT DREAM STRANGE THINGS AND MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE TRUTH HE NEED NEVER TRY TO WRITE ROMANCES
THE CLERGYMAN'S SHY AND SENSITIVE RESERVE HAD BALKED THIS SCHEME
DOST THOU KNOW THY MOTHER NOW CHILD ASKED SHE REPROACHFULLY BUT WITH A SUBDUED TONE
IN ORDER TO FREE HIS MIND FROM THIS INDISTINCTNESS AND DUPLICITY OF IMPRESSION WHICH VEXED IT WITH A STRANGE DISQUIETUDE HE RECALLED AND MORE THOROUGHLY DEFINED THE PLANS WHICH HESTER AND HIMSELF HAD SKETCHED FOR THEIR DEPARTURE
THERE!--BEFORE THEE!--ON THE HITHER SIDE OF THE BROOK THE CHILD TURNED HER EYES TO THE POINT INDICATED AND THERE LAY THE SCARLET LETTER SO CLOSE UPON THE MARGIN OF THE STREAM THAT THE GOLD EMBROIDERY WAS REFLECTED IN IT
SUPPORT ME UP YONDER SCAFFOLD THE CROWD WAS IN A TUMULT
SO LONG ESTRANGED BY FATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES THEY NEEDED SOMETHING SLIGHT AND CASUAL TO RUN BEFORE AND THROW OPEN THE DOORS OF INTERCOURSE SO THAT THEIR REAL THOUGHTS MIGHT BE LED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD
OF AN IMPULSIVE AND PASSIONATE NATURE SHE HAD FORTIFIED HERSELF TO ENCOUNTER THE STINGS AND VENOMOUS STABS OF PUBLIC CONTUMELY WREAKING ITSELF IN EVERY VARIETY OF INSULT
FINDING IT SO DIRECTLY ON THE THRESHOLD OF OUR NARRATIVE WHICH IS NOW ABOUT TO ISSUE FROM THAT INAUSPICIOUS PORTAL WE COULD HARDLY DO OTHERWISE THAN PLUCK ONE OF ITS FLOWERS AND PRESENT IT TO THE READER
THE MINISTER MIGHT STAND THERE IF IT SO PLEASED HIM UNTIL MORNING SHOULD REDDEN IN THE EAST WITHOUT OTHER RISK THAN THAT THE DANK AND CHILL NIGHT AIR WOULD CREEP INTO HIS FRAME AND STIFFEN HIS JOINTS WITH RHEUMATISM AND CLOG HIS THROAT WITH CATARRH AND COUGH
A FOREST WALK HESTER PRYNNE REMAINED CONSTANT IN HER RESOLVE TO MAKE KNOWN TO MR DIMMESDALE AT WHATEVER RISK OF PRESENT PAIN OR ULTERIOR CONSEQUENCES THE TRUE CHARACTER OF THE MAN WHO HAD CREPT INTO HIS INTIMACY
HE LOOKED LIKE THE DARKLY ENGRAVED PORTRAITS WHICH WE SEE PREFIXED TO OLD VOLUMES OF SERMONS AND HAD NO MORE RIGHT THAN ONE OF THOSE PORTRAITS WOULD HAVE TO STEP FORTH AS HE NOW DID AND MEDDLE WITH A QUESTION OF HUMAN GUILT PASSION AND ANGUISH
BUT NONE WE APPREHEND SO PITIABLY WEAK
HERE AND THERE SHE CAME TO A FULL STOP AND PEEPED CURIOUSLY INTO A POOL LEFT BY THE RETIRING TIDE AS A MIRROR FOR PEARL TO SEE HER FACE IN
SHE HAD WANDERED WITHOUT RULE OR GUIDANCE IN A MORAL WILDERNESS AS VAST AS INTRICATE AND SHADOWY AS THE UNTAMED FOREST AMID THE GLOOM OF WHICH THEY WERE NOW HOLDING A COLLOQUY THAT WAS TO DECIDE THEIR FATE
THE DEMOCRATS TAKE THE OFFICES AS A GENERAL RULE BECAUSE THEY NEED THEM AND BECAUSE THE PRACTICE OF MANY YEARS HAS MADE IT THE LAW OF POLITICAL WARFARE WHICH UNLESS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM BE PROCLAIMED IT WAS WEAKNESS AND COWARDICE TO MURMUR AT
THEN LET THE MAGISTRATES WHO HAVE MADE IT OF NO EFFECT THANK THEMSELVES IF THEIR OWN WIVES AND DAUGHTERS GO ASTRAY MERCY ON US GOODWIFE EXCLAIMED A MAN IN THE CROWD IS THERE NO VIRTUE IN WOMAN SAVE WHAT SPRINGS FROM A WHOLESOME FEAR OF THE GALLOWS
AND METHINKS IT MUST GLADDEN YOUR HEART AFTER YOUR TROUBLES AND SOJOURN IN THE WILDERNESS SAID THE TOWNSMAN TO FIND YOURSELF AT LENGTH IN A LAND WHERE INIQUITY IS SEARCHED OUT AND PUNISHED IN THE SIGHT OF RULERS AND PEOPLE AS HERE IN OUR GODLY NEW ENGLAND
THE CHILD WITH THE BIRD-LIKE MOTION WHICH WAS ONE OF HER CHARACTERISTICS FLEW TO HIM AND CLASPED HER ARMS ABOUT HIS KNEES
BREATHE NOT THE SECRET ABOVE ALL TO THE MAN THOU WOTTEST OF
MEANWHILE THE MERCHANTS AND SHIP-MASTERS THE SPRUCE CLERKS AND UNCOUTH SAILORS ENTERED AND DEPARTED
OF FEW ARTISTIC ENCOURAGEMENTS YET NOT WHOLLY UNCONGENIAL HIS MOODY INTENSELY MEDITATIVE TEMPERAMENT BEING CONSIDERED
BE IF THY SPIRIT SUMMON THEE TO SUCH A MISSION THE TEACHER AND APOSTLE OF THE RED MEN
COME THOU AND ENTREAT HIS BLESSING
IF THOU SO CHOOSE IT WILL BEAR THEE BACK AGAIN
PLAYING AT GOING TO CHURCH PERCHANCE OR AT SCOURGING QUAKERS
FOR HE WAS HAPPIER WHILE STRAYING THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THESE SUNLESS FANTASIES THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE HE HAD QUITTED THE OLD MANSE
THEY HAD FORTITUDE AND SELF-RELIANCE AND IN TIME OF DIFFICULTY OR PERIL STOOD UP FOR THE WELFARE OF THE STATE LIKE A LINE OF CLIFFS AGAINST A TEMPESTUOUS TIDE
I PRAY YOU GOOD SIR SAID HE WHO IS THIS WOMAN?--AND WHEREFORE IS SHE HERE SET UP TO PUBLIC SHAME YOU MUST NEEDS BE A STRANGER IN THIS REGION FRIEND ANSWERED THE TOWNSMAN LOOKING CURIOUSLY AT THE QUESTIONER AND HIS SAVAGE COMPANION ELSE YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE HEARD OF MISTRESS HESTER PRYNNE AND HER EVIL DOINGS
THERE HE STOOD WITH A BORDER OF GRIZZLED LOCKS BENEATH HIS SKULL-CAP WHILE HIS GREY EYES ACCUSTOMED TO THE SHADED LIGHT OF HIS STUDY WERE WINKING LIKE THOSE OF HESTER'S INFANT IN THE UNADULTERATED SUNSHINE
AND AT LAST SUNRISE THREW A GOLDEN BEAM INTO THE STUDY AND LAID IT RIGHT ACROSS THE MINISTER'S BEDAZZLED EYES
OR MUST SHE RECEIVE THOSE INTIMATIONS--SO OBSCURE YET SO DISTINCT--AS TRUTH
THEN TELL HER REJOINED HE THAT I SPAKE AGAIN WITH THE BLACK-A-VISAGED HUMP SHOULDERED OLD DOCTOR AND HE ENGAGES TO BRING HIS FRIEND THE GENTLEMAN SHE WOTS OF ABOARD WITH HIM
THE RULERS AND THE WISE AND LEARNED MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WERE LONGER IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE INFLUENCE OF HESTER'S GOOD QUALITIES THAN THE PEOPLE
CONTINUALLY PRYING INTO MY MIND TO DISCOVER WHICH OF ITS POOR PROPERTIES WERE GONE AND WHAT DEGREE OF DETRIMENT HAD ALREADY ACCRUED TO THE REMAINDER
THEN TO SPEAK MORE PLAINLY CONTINUED THE PHYSICIAN AND I CRAVE PARDON SIR SHOULD IT SEEM TO REQUIRE PARDON FOR THIS NEEDFUL PLAINNESS OF MY SPEECH
WITH HER NATIVE ENERGY OF CHARACTER AND RARE CAPACITY IT COULD NOT ENTIRELY CAST HER OFF ALTHOUGH IT HAD SET A MARK UPON HER MORE INTOLERABLE TO A WOMAN'S HEART THAN THAT WHICH BRANDED THE BROW OF CAIN
THE VENERABLE FATHER WILSON CONTINUED TO STEP SLOWLY ONWARD LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE MUDDY PATHWAY BEFORE HIS FEET AND NEVER ONCE TURNING HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE GUILTY PLATFORM
DO WITH HIM AS THOU WILT
BUT ONWARD TOO
SHE HAD BEEN OFFERED TO THE WORLD THESE SEVEN PAST YEARS AS THE LIVING HIEROGLYPHIC IN WHICH WAS REVEALED THE SECRET THEY SO DARKLY SOUGHT TO HIDE--ALL WRITTEN IN THIS SYMBOL--ALL PLAINLY MANIFEST--HAD THERE BEEN A PROPHET OR MAGICIAN SKILLED TO READ THE CHARACTER OF FLAME
MEN OF THE SWORD HAD OVERTHROWN NOBLES AND KINGS
ITS FRONT IS ORNAMENTED WITH A PORTICO OF HALF-A-DOZEN WOODEN PILLARS SUPPORTING A BALCONY BENEATH WHICH A FLIGHT OF WIDE GRANITE STEPS DESCENDS TOWARDS THE STREET
NOTHING IN HESTER'S FORM THOUGH MAJESTIC AND STATUE LIKE THAT PASSION WOULD EVER DREAM OF CLASPING IN ITS EMBRACE
A TIN PIPE ASCENDS THROUGH THE CEILING AND FORMS A MEDIUM OF VOCAL COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE EDIFICE
GIVE UP THIS NAME OF ARTHUR DIMMESDALE AND MAKE THYSELF ANOTHER AND A HIGH ONE SUCH AS THOU CANST WEAR WITHOUT FEAR OR SHAME
YE CANNOT TAKE IT OFF
WHEREFORE HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE LEFT THEIR WORK TO-DAY
SHE SAW THAT HE STOOD ON THE VERGE OF LUNACY IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY STEPPED ACROSS IT
OR THE RECENTLY ARRIVED ONE PALE AND FEEBLE SEEKING A PASSPORT TO THE HOSPITAL
THERE WERE OTHERS AGAIN TRUE SAINTLY FATHERS WHOSE FACULTIES HAD BEEN ELABORATED BY WEARY TOIL AMONG THEIR BOOKS AND BY PATIENT THOUGHT AND ETHEREALISED MOREOVER BY SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BETTER WORLD INTO WHICH THEIR PURITY OF LIFE HAD ALMOST INTRODUCED THESE HOLY PERSONAGES WITH THEIR GARMENTS OF MORTALITY STILL CLINGING TO THEM
HESTER PRYNNE LOOKED AT THE MAN OF SKILL AND EVEN THEN WITH HER FATE HANGING IN THE BALANCE WAS STARTLED TO PERCEIVE WHAT A CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIS FEATURES--HOW MUCH UGLIER THEY WERE HOW HIS DARK COMPLEXION SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN DUSKIER AND HIS FIGURE MORE MISSHAPEN--SINCE THE DAYS WHEN SHE HAD FAMILIARLY KNOWN HIM
XVII
IT WOULD BE SAD INJUSTICE THE READER MUST UNDERSTAND TO REPRESENT ALL MY EXCELLENT OLD FRIENDS AS IN THEIR DOTAGE
HE WON IT INDEED IN GREAT PART BY HIS SORROWS
FROM THE EARLIEST EPOCH OF HER CONSCIOUS LIFE SHE HAD ENTERED UPON THIS AS HER APPOINTED MISSION
HESTER PRYNNE SAID HE LEANING OVER THE BALCONY AND LOOKING DOWN STEADFASTLY INTO HER EYES THOU HEAREST WHAT THIS GOOD MAN SAYS AND SEEST THE ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER WHICH I LABOUR
THEN PERHAPS--FOR THERE WAS NO FORESEEING HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT HER--PEARL WOULD FROWN AND CLENCH HER LITTLE FIST AND HARDEN HER SMALL FEATURES INTO A STERN UNSYMPATHISING LOOK OF DISCONTENT
THE FOREST WAS OBSCURE AROUND THEM AND CREAKED WITH A BLAST THAT WAS PASSING THROUGH IT
AND YET THEY LINGERED
HAVE I THEN SOLD MYSELF THOUGHT THE MINISTER TO THE FIEND WHOM IF MEN SAY TRUE THIS YELLOW-STARCHED AND VELVETED OLD HAG HAS CHOSEN FOR HER PRINCE AND MASTER THE WRETCHED MINISTER
AND SATAN LAUGHS AT IT YOU WRONG YOURSELF IN THIS SAID HESTER GENTLY
WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH US THAT EXPRESSION SEEMED TO SAY
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT THAT WHATEVER PAINFUL EFFICACY THERE MIGHT BE IN THE SECRET STING OF REMORSE A DEADLIER VENOM HAD BEEN INFUSED INTO IT BY THE HAND THAT PROFFERED RELIEF
HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO HIM AS A PARISHIONER AND SOUGHT TO WIN A FRIENDLY REGARD AND CONFIDENCE FROM HIS NATURALLY RESERVED SENSIBILITY
EXCEPT AS PEARL IN THE DEARTH OF HUMAN PLAYMATES WAS THROWN MORE UPON THE VISIONARY THRONG WHICH SHE CREATED
LET IT SUFFICE THAT THE CLERGYMAN RESOLVED TO FLEE AND NOT ALONE
I AM LITTLE PEARL REPEATED THE CHILD CONTINUING HER ANTICS
AND WHAT HAST THOU TO DO WITH ALL THESE IRON MEN AND THEIR OPINIONS
WHEN AN UNINSTRUCTED MULTITUDE ATTEMPTS TO SEE WITH ITS EYES IT IS EXCEEDINGLY APT TO BE DECEIVED
MY IMAGINATION WAS A TARNISHED MIRROR
BUT THE SEA IN THOSE OLD TIMES HEAVED SWELLED AND FOAMED VERY MUCH AT ITS OWN WILL OR SUBJECT ONLY TO THE TEMPESTUOUS WIND WITH HARDLY ANY ATTEMPTS AT REGULATION BY HUMAN LAW
HE THUS TYPIFIED THE CONSTANT INTROSPECTION WHEREWITH HE TORTURED BUT COULD NOT PURIFY HIMSELF
DID THE SUN WHICH SHONE SO BRIGHTLY EVERYWHERE ELSE REALLY FALL UPON HIM
WHILE OUT OF A STILL LOWER DEPTH CAME THE GLEAM OF A KIND OF FRAGMENTARY SMILE FLOATING TO AND FRO IN THE AGITATED WATER
YET DID THE PHYSICIAN IN HIS DARK WAY CREEP FRIGHTFULLY NEAR THE SECRET
THE LEECH UNDER THE APPELLATION OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THE READER WILL REMEMBER WAS HIDDEN ANOTHER NAME WHICH ITS FORMER WEARER HAD RESOLVED SHOULD NEVER MORE BE SPOKEN
THE MOTHER'S IMPASSIONED STATE HAD BEEN THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE UNBORN INFANT THE RAYS OF ITS MORAL LIFE
NEITHER SHALT THOU FREIGHT THE SHIP WITH IT IF THOU PREFER TO CROSS THE SEA
UNTIL SOME FEW MILES HENCE THE YELLOW LEAVES WILL SHOW NO VESTIGE OF THE WHITE MAN'S TREAD
SHE RAN AND LOOKED THE WILD INDIAN IN THE FACE AND HE GREW CONSCIOUS OF A NATURE WILDER THAN HIS OWN
HE EXAMINED THE INFANT CAREFULLY AND THEN PROCEEDED TO UNCLASP A LEATHERN CASE WHICH HE TOOK FROM BENEATH HIS DRESS
BUT ELSEWHERE MAY BE ONLY A SHAPELESS MOUND CUMBROUS WITH ITS VERY STRENGTH AND OVERGROWN THROUGH LONG YEARS OF PEACE AND NEGLECT WITH GRASS AND ALIEN WEEDS
THE MINISTER SAW NOTHING FURTHER OF HER MOTIONS
IN A MOMENT MORE THE CROWD BEGAN TO GUSH FORTH FROM THE DOORS OF THE CHURCH
BUT IF IT BE THE SOUL'S DISEASE THEN DO I COMMIT MYSELF TO THE ONE PHYSICIAN OF THE SOUL
HAPPY MAN WERE I AND WELL DESERVING OF NEW ENGLAND'S GRATITUDE COULD I ACHIEVE THIS CURE I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART MOST WATCHFUL FRIEND SAID THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE WITH A SOLEMN SMILE
TO SEEK RESOLUTELY THE TRUE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE VALUE THAT LAY HIDDEN IN THE PETTY AND WEARISOME INCIDENTS AND ORDINARY CHARACTERS WITH WHICH I WAS NOW CONVERSANT
THERE BESIDE THE FIREPLACE THE BRAVE OLD GENERAL USED TO SIT
AND EVEN WITH THIS TERROR IN HIS HEART HE COULD HARDLY AVOID LAUGHING TO IMAGINE HOW THE SANCTIFIED OLD PATRIARCHAL DEACON WOULD HAVE BEEN PETRIFIED BY HIS MINISTER'S IMPIETY
IT WAS LIKE A MASK

MY FORGIVENESS TO MY ENEMIES
BUT NOW--SINCE I AM IRREVOCABLY DOOMED--WHEREFORE SHOULD I NOT SNATCH THE SOLACE ALLOWED TO THE CONDEMNED CULPRIT BEFORE HIS EXECUTION
GRANDFATHER'S CHAIR A HISTORY FOR YOUTH 1845
SHE COULD NOT BUT TREMBLE AT THESE PREPARATIONS
AS CONCERNS THE GOOD WHICH I MAY APPEAR TO DO I HAVE NO FAITH IN IT
WHAT SAYEST THOU CRIED HE
OR NEARER AT HAND A NOVA SCOTIA SCHOONER PITCHING OUT HER CARGO OF FIREWOOD--AT THE HEAD I SAY OF THIS DILAPIDATED WHARF WHICH THE TIDE OFTEN OVERFLOWS AND ALONG WHICH AT THE BASE AND IN THE REAR OF THE ROW OF BUILDINGS THE TRACK OF MANY LANGUID YEARS IS SEEN IN A BORDER OF UNTHRIFTY GRASS--HERE WITH A VIEW FROM ITS FRONT WINDOWS ADOWN THIS NOT VERY ENLIVENING PROSPECT AND THENCE ACROSS THE HARBOUR STANDS A SPACIOUS EDIFICE OF BRICK
THE OTHER EMINENT CHARACTERS BY WHOM THE CHIEF RULER WAS SURROUNDED WERE DISTINGUISHED BY A DIGNITY OF MIEN BELONGING TO A PERIOD WHEN THE FORMS OF AUTHORITY WERE FELT TO POSSESS THE SACREDNESS OF DIVINE INSTITUTIONS
OR THE ROMANCE OF MONTE BENI 4 EDITOR'S NOTE PUBLISHED IN ENGLAND UNDER THE TITLE OF TRANSFORMATION 1860 OUR OLD HOME 1863
IN MR DIMMESDALE'S SECRET CLOSET UNDER LOCK AND KEY THERE WAS A BLOODY SCOURGE
LONG ENOUGH TO BREAK OFF OLD INTELLECTUAL HABITS AND MAKE ROOM FOR NEW ONES
CERTAINLY IF THE METEOR KINDLED UP THE SKY AND DISCLOSED THE EARTH WITH AN AWFULNESS THAT ADMONISHED HESTER PRYNNE AND THE CLERGYMAN OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT THEN MIGHT ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HAVE PASSED WITH THEM FOR THE ARCH-FIEND STANDING THERE WITH A SMILE AND SCOWL TO CLAIM HIS OWN
NOW STARTING BACK FROM A DEEP CHASM
THOU LOOKEST FAR INTO ETERNITY WITH THOSE BRIGHT DYING EYES
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER STOOD TOGETHER IN THE SAME CIRCLE OF SECLUSION FROM HUMAN SOCIETY
ALL MERELY GRACEFUL ATTRIBUTES ARE USUALLY THE MOST EVANESCENT
ONE PICTURE PRECISELY AS VIVID AS ANOTHER
THOSE WHO HAD BEFORE KNOWN HER AND HAD EXPECTED TO BEHOLD HER DIMMED AND OBSCURED BY A DISASTROUS CLOUD WERE ASTONISHED AND EVEN STARTLED TO PERCEIVE HOW HER BEAUTY SHONE OUT AND MADE A HALO OF THE MISFORTUNE AND IGNOMINY IN WHICH SHE WAS ENVELOPED
WOULD HE HAVE CLAPPED HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART AND SCOWLED ON ME AND BID ME BEGONE WHAT SHOULD HE SAY PEARL ANSWERED HESTER SAVE THAT IT WAS NO TIME TO KISS AND THAT KISSES ARE NOT TO BE GIVEN IN THE MARKET-PLACE
AND ALL THE IMAGINATIVE DELIGHT WHEREWITH IT HAD BEEN SPIRITUALIZED PASSED AWAY OUT OF MY MIND
BUT THIS SELDOM HAPPENS
THIS EFFERVESCENCE MADE HER FLIT WITH A BIRD-LIKE MOVEMENT RATHER THAN WALK BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE
OR SHOULD IT SUCCEED IN MANIFESTING ITS FORBIDDEN SYMPATHY AWAKENING ONLY TERROR AND HORRIBLE REPUGNANCE
AMERICAN NOTE-BOOKS 1868
THE JAILER AFTER USHERING HIM INTO THE ROOM REMAINED A MOMENT MARVELLING AT THE COMPARATIVE QUIET THAT FOLLOWED HIS ENTRANCE
AT ANY MOMENT BY AN EFFORT OF HIS WILL HE COULD DISCERN SUBSTANCES THROUGH THEIR MISTY LACK OF SUBSTANCE AND CONVINCE HIMSELF THAT THEY WERE NOT SOLID IN THEIR NATURE LIKE YONDER TABLE OF CARVED OAK OR THAT BIG SQUARE LEATHER-BOUND AND BRAZEN-CLASPED VOLUME OF DIVINITY
WAS EVER SUCH A CHILD OBSERVED HESTER ASIDE TO THE MINISTER
SOME AFFIRMED THAT THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE ON THE VERY DAY WHEN HESTER PRYNNE FIRST WORE HER IGNOMINIOUS BADGE HAD BEGUN A COURSE OF PENANCE--WHICH HE AFTERWARDS IN SO MANY FUTILE METHODS FOLLOWED OUT--BY INFLICTING A HIDEOUS TORTURE ON HIMSELF
THEY STOOD IN THE NOON OF THAT STRANGE AND SOLEMN SPLENDOUR AS IF IT WERE THE LIGHT THAT IS TO REVEAL ALL SECRETS AND THE DAYBREAK THAT SHALL UNITE ALL WHO BELONG TO ONE ANOTHER
AND GIVE YOUR CHILD A FATHER I WILL NOT SPEAK ANSWERED HESTER TURNING PALE AS DEATH BUT RESPONDING TO THIS VOICE WHICH SHE TOO SURELY RECOGNISED
I FOUND THEM GROWING ON A GRAVE WHICH BORE NO TOMBSTONE NO OTHER MEMORIAL OF THE DEAD MAN SAVE THESE UGLY WEEDS THAT HAVE TAKEN UPON THEMSELVES TO KEEP HIM IN REMEMBRANCE
PROVIDENCE HAD MEDITATED BETTER THINGS FOR ME THAN I COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE FOR MYSELF
IT SEEMED TO ARGUE SO WIDE A DIFFUSION OF HER SHAME THAT ALL NATURE KNEW OF IT
SUCH WAS THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN'S CONDITION AND SO IMMINENT THE PROSPECT THAT HIS DAWNING LIGHT WOULD BE EXTINGUISHED ALL UNTIMELY WHEN ROGER CHILLINGWORTH MADE HIS ADVENT TO THE TOWN
THE ROOM ITSELF IS COBWEBBED AND DINGY WITH OLD PAINT
THERE WAS THE BIBLE IN ITS RICH OLD HEBREW WITH MOSES AND THE PROPHETS SPEAKING TO HIM AND GOD'S VOICE THROUGH ALL
AT THE INSTANT I WAS ONLY CONSCIOUS THAT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE ONCE WAS NOW A HOPELESS TOIL
I SHIVER AT HIM
EVEN THE INDIANS WERE AFFECTED BY A SORT OF COLD SHADOW OF THE WHITE MAN'S CURIOSITY AND GLIDING THROUGH THE CROWD FASTENED THEIR SNAKE-LIKE BLACK EYES ON HESTER'S BOSOM CONCEIVING PERHAPS THAT THE WEARER OF THIS BRILLIANTLY EMBROIDERED BADGE MUST NEEDS BE A PERSONAGE OF HIGH DIGNITY AMONG HER PEOPLE
THOU MUST NOT TALK SO ANSWERED THE MOTHER SUPPRESSING A GROAN
HE TELLS YOU THAT WITH ALL ITS MYSTERIOUS HORROR IT IS BUT THE SHADOW OF WHAT HE BEARS ON HIS OWN BREAST AND THAT EVEN THIS HIS OWN RED STIGMA IS NO MORE THAN THE TYPE OF WHAT HAS SEARED HIS INMOST HEART
FOR AS SHE LIFTED HER EYES TOWARDS THE BALCONY THE UNHAPPY WOMAN GREW PALE AND TREMBLED
HERE THEY SAT DOWN ON A LUXURIANT HEAP OF MOSS
AT ONE OF THE CHAMBER-WINDOWS OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM'S MANSION WHICH STOOD AT SOME DISTANCE ON THE LINE OF ANOTHER STREET HE BEHELD THE APPEARANCE OF THE OLD MAGISTRATE HIMSELF WITH A LAMP IN HIS HAND A WHITE NIGHT-CAP ON HIS HEAD AND A LONG WHITE GOWN ENVELOPING HIS FIGURE
NOR WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IMPRACTICABLE IN THE OBSERVANCE OF MAJESTIC CEREMONIES TO COMBINE MIRTHFUL RECREATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND GIVE AS IT WERE A GROTESQUE AND BRILLIANT EMBROIDERY TO THE GREAT ROBE OF STATE WHICH A NATION AT SUCH FESTIVALS PUTS ON
WILT THOU TELL HER THIS THOU WITCH-BABY MISTRESS HIBBINS SAYS MY FATHER IS THE PRINCE OF THE AIR CRIED PEARL WITH A NAUGHTY SMILE
I HAVE MET WITH GRIEVOUS MISHAPS BY SEA AND LAND AND HAVE BEEN LONG HELD IN BONDS AMONG THE HEATHEN-FOLK TO THE SOUTHWARD
HER ONLY JUSTIFICATION LAY IN THE FACT THAT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN NO METHOD OF RESCUING HIM FROM A BLACKER RUIN THAN HAD OVERWHELMED HERSELF EXCEPT BY ACQUIESCING IN ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S SCHEME OF DISGUISE
HESTER SOUGHT NOT TO ACQUIRE ANYTHING BEYOND A SUBSISTENCE OF THE PLAINEST AND MOST ASCETIC DESCRIPTION FOR HERSELF AND A SIMPLE ABUNDANCE FOR HER CHILD
WOMAN TRANSGRESS NOT BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HEAVEN'S MERCY CRIED THE REVEREND MR WILSON MORE HARSHLY THAN BEFORE
DAY AFTER DAY SHE LOOKED FEARFULLY INTO THE CHILD'S EXPANDING NATURE EVER DREADING TO DETECT SOME DARK AND WILD PECULIARITY THAT SHOULD CORRESPOND WITH THE GUILTINESS TO WHICH SHE OWED HER BEING
THE LINKS THAT UNITED HER TO THE REST OF HUMANKIND--LINKS OF FLOWERS OR SILK OR GOLD OR WHATEVER THE MATERIAL--HAD ALL BEEN BROKEN
EVEN THEN I WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF MY DAYS NOR WAS IT THE EARLY AUTUMN
ART THOU MY CHILD IN VERY TRUTH ASKED HESTER
WITH THE SUPERSTITION COMMON TO HIS BROTHERHOOD HE FANCIED HIMSELF GIVEN OVER TO A FIEND TO BE TORTURED WITH FRIGHTFUL DREAMS AND DESPERATE THOUGHTS THE STING OF REMORSE AND DESPAIR OF PARDON AS A FORETASTE OF WHAT AWAITS HIM BEYOND THE GRAVE
SO IT SEEMED TO BE WITH HESTER
A PARTRIDGE INDEED WITH A BROOD OF TEN BEHIND HER RAN FORWARD THREATENINGLY BUT SOON REPENTED OF HER FIERCENESS AND CLUCKED TO HER YOUNG ONES NOT TO BE AFRAID
SUCH HELPFULNESS WAS FOUND IN HER--SO MUCH POWER TO DO AND POWER TO SYMPATHISE--THAT MANY PEOPLE REFUSED TO INTERPRET THE SCARLET A BY ITS ORIGINAL SIGNIFICATION
WITH ALMOST A SERENE DEPORTMENT THEREFORE HESTER PRYNNE PASSED THROUGH THIS PORTION OF HER ORDEAL AND CAME TO A SORT OF SCAFFOLD AT THE WESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE MARKET-PLACE
O'CONNOR 1882
SHE HATH GOOD SKILL AT HER NEEDLE THAT'S CERTAIN REMARKED ONE OF HER FEMALE SPECTATORS
WHEREVER HER WALK HATH BEEN--WHEREVER SO MISERABLY BURDENED SHE MAY HAVE HOPED TO FIND REPOSE--IT HATH CAST A LURID GLEAM OF AWE AND HORRIBLE REPUGNANCE ROUND ABOUT HER
HE TO WHOM ONLY THE OUTWARD AND PHYSICAL EVIL IS LAID OPEN KNOWETH OFTENTIMES BUT HALF THE EVIL WHICH HE IS CALLED UPON TO CURE
HERE ONE WOULD SUPPOSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SORROW ENOUGH TO IMBUE THE SUNNIEST DISPOSITION THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH A SABLE TINGE
AND THIS MOREOVER WAS A MOTHER'S ESTIMATE OF THE CHILD'S DISPOSITION
ALONE IN THE WORLD CAST OFF BY IT AND WITH THIS SOLE TREASURE TO KEEP HER HEART ALIVE SHE FELT THAT SHE POSSESSED INDEFEASIBLE RIGHTS AGAINST THE WORLD AND WAS READY TO DEFEND THEM TO THE DEATH
NOW GOOD SIR OUR MASSACHUSETTS MAGISTRACY BETHINKING THEMSELVES THAT THIS WOMAN IS YOUTHFUL AND FAIR AND DOUBTLESS WAS STRONGLY TEMPTED TO HER FALL AND THAT MOREOVER AS IS MOST LIKELY HER HUSBAND MAY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THEY HAVE NOT BEEN BOLD TO PUT IN FORCE THE EXTREMITY OF OUR RIGHTEOUS LAW AGAINST HER
NOT MOSTLY ANSWERED THE MOTHER WITH A TENDER SMILE
BE IT SO
AND AS HER TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT OF THE ORDER THAT ESCAPES FROM TOO INTENSE SUFFERING BY A SWOON HER SPIRIT COULD ONLY SHELTER ITSELF BENEATH A STONY CRUST OF INSENSIBILITY WHILE THE FACULTIES OF ANIMAL LIFE REMAINED ENTIRE
NO MATTER WHETHER OF RIGHT OR WRONG
HESTER PRYNNE MEANWHILE KEPT HER PLACE UPON THE PEDESTAL OF SHAME WITH GLAZED EYES AND AN AIR OF WEARY INDIFFERENCE
WERE IT NOT THINKEST THOU FOR THY LITTLE ONE'S TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL WELFARE THAT SHE BE TAKEN OUT OF THY CHARGE AND CLAD SOBERLY AND DISCIPLINED STRICTLY AND INSTRUCTED IN THE TRUTHS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
HE HAD MADE A BARGAIN VERY LIKE IT
BUT NOW WITH THIS UNATTENDED WALK FROM HER PRISON DOOR BEGAN THE DAILY CUSTOM
A GRATEFUL RECOGNITION OF THE PROMPTITUDE OF THEIR ZEAL THE MOMENT THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY REMEDY
NO NOR AGAINST HIS FAME IF AS I JUDGE HE BE A MAN OF FAIR REPUTE
SINCE THAT DAY NO MAN IS SO NEAR TO HIM AS YOU
WHILE STILL THE LITTLE HAND OF THE SIN-BORN CHILD WAS CLASPED IN HIS
AT SOME FUTURE DAY IT MAY BE I SHALL REMEMBER A FEW SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AND BROKEN PARAGRAPHS AND WRITE THEM DOWN AND FIND THE LETTERS TURN TO GOLD UPON THE PAGE
SAVE IT WERE THE CANKERED WRATH OF AN OLD WITCH LIKE MISTRESS HIBBINS ADDED HE ATTEMPTING TO SMILE I KNOW NOTHING THAT I WOULD NOT SOONER ENCOUNTER THAN THIS PASSION IN A CHILD
ESPECIALLY SHE IS GENERALLY INTOLERANT OF EMOTION WHEN SHE DOES NOT FULLY COMPREHEND THE WHY AND WHEREFORE
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING AT ONCE TENDER AND STRANGELY TRIUMPHANT IN IT
DOST THOU KNOW CHILD WHEREFORE THY MOTHER WEARS THIS LETTER TRULY DO I ANSWERED PEARL LOOKING BRIGHTLY INTO HER MOTHER'S FACE
HENRY JAMES ENGLISH MEN OF LETTERS 1879
BUT AS HE CAME DOWN THE PULPIT STEPS THE GREY-BEARDED SEXTON MET HIM HOLDING UP A BLACK GLOVE WHICH THE MINISTER RECOGNISED AS HIS OWN
BUT HE WILL BE KNOWN--HE WILL BE KNOWN!--HE WILL BE KNOWN HE BOWED COURTEOUSLY TO THE COMMUNICATIVE TOWNSMAN AND WHISPERING A FEW WORDS TO HIS INDIAN ATTENDANT THEY BOTH MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD
NOT SO INDEED
THE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM IN A LOOSE GOWN AND EASY CAP--SUCH AS ELDERLY GENTLEMEN LOVED TO ENDUE THEMSELVES WITH IN THEIR DOMESTIC PRIVACY--WALKED FOREMOST AND APPEARED TO BE SHOWING OFF HIS ESTATE AND EXPATIATING ON HIS PROJECTED IMPROVEMENTS
THUS THERE HAD COME TO THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE--AS TO MOST MEN IN THEIR VARIOUS SPHERES THOUGH SELDOM RECOGNISED UNTIL THEY SEE IT FAR BEHIND THEM--AN EPOCH OF LIFE MORE BRILLIANT AND FULL OF TRIUMPH THAN ANY PREVIOUS ONE OR THAN ANY WHICH COULD HEREAFTER BE
THE MINISTER GREW COMPARATIVELY CALM
MY CONCLUSION WAS THAT HE HAD NO SOUL NO HEART NO MIND
IT IS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THE MINISTER KEEPS HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART AND WHAT REASON IS THAT ASKED HESTER HALF SMILING AT THE ABSURD INCONGRUITY OF THE CHILD'S OBSERVATION
I KNOW NOT SHE HURRIEDLY REPLIED
SPEAK TO THE WOMAN MY BROTHER SAID MR WILSON
THE CHARACTERS OF THE NARRATIVE WOULD NOT BE WARMED AND RENDERED MALLEABLE BY ANY HEAT THAT I COULD KINDLE AT MY INTELLECTUAL FORGE
BUT DID EVER A WOMAN BEFORE THIS BRAZEN HUSSY CONTRIVE SUCH A WAY OF SHOWING IT
OR I MIGHT READILY HAVE FOUND A MORE SERIOUS TASK
IT WAS A FORCIBLE TYPE OF THE MORAL SOLITUDE IN WHICH THE SCARLET LETTER ENVELOPED ITS FATED WEARER
STRETCHING FORTH THE OFFICIAL STAFF IN HIS LEFT HAND HE LAID HIS RIGHT UPON THE SHOULDER OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHOM HE THUS DREW FORWARD UNTIL ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE PRISON-DOOR SHE REPELLED HIM BY AN ACTION MARKED WITH NATURAL DIGNITY AND FORCE OF CHARACTER AND STEPPED INTO THE OPEN AIR AS IF BY HER OWN FREE WILL
KNICKERBOCKER 1837-1839
NAY WE MIGHT HAVE JUDGED THAT SUCH A CHILD'S MOTHER MUST NEEDS BE A SCARLET WOMAN AND A WORTHY TYPE OF HER OF BABYLON
THE BOWERS APPEARED TO KNOW IT AND ONE AND ANOTHER WHISPERED AS SHE PASSED ADORN THYSELF WITH ME THOU BEAUTIFUL CHILD ADORN THYSELF WITH ME!"--AND TO PLEASE THEM PEARL GATHERED THE VIOLETS AND ANEMONES AND COLUMBINES AND SOME TWIGS OF THE FRESHEST GREEN WHICH THE OLD TREES HELD DOWN BEFORE HER EYES
HER BREAST WITH ITS BADGE OF SHAME WAS BUT THE SOFTER PILLOW FOR THE HEAD THAT NEEDED ONE
THEY KNOW HOW TO SPARE WHEN THEY SEE OCCASION
AFTER A BRIEF PAUSE THE PHYSICIAN TURNED AWAY
BE TRUE
BE TRUE
BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER-WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
THAT HIS MIND WAS DARKENED AND CONFUSED BY THE VERY REMORSE WHICH HARROWED IT
THERE HAD BEEN A PERIOD WHEN HESTER WAS LESS ALIVE TO THIS CONSIDERATION
HIS ELOQUENCE AND RELIGIOUS FERVOUR HAD ALREADY GIVEN THE EARNEST OF HIGH EMINENCE IN HIS PROFESSION
AND GOOD FATHER WILSON TOO AFTER SPENDING HALF THE NIGHT AT A DEATH-BED AND LIKING ILL TO BE DISTURBED THUS EARLY OUT OF HIS DREAMS ABOUT THE GLORIFIED SAINTS
WOULD HE AROUSE HIM WITH A THROB OF AGONY
NAY NOW THAT THE BURDEN WAS REMOVED IT SEEMED ALMOST AS IF HE WOULD BE SPORTIVE WITH THE CHILD--"DEAR LITTLE PEARL WILT THOU KISS ME NOW
THE HIGHER THE STATE THE MORE DELICATELY ADAPTED TO IT THE MAN
THE ORIGINAL AND MORE POTENT CAUSES HOWEVER LAY IN THE RARE PERFECTION OF HIS ANIMAL NATURE THE MODERATE PROPORTION OF INTELLECT AND THE VERY TRIFLING ADMIXTURE OF MORAL AND SPIRITUAL INGREDIENTS
TANGLEWOOD TALES 2ND SERIES OF THE WONDER BOOK 1853
THERE IS ONE WORSE THAN EVEN THE POLLUTED PRIEST
NEVERTHELESS--TO HOLD NOTHING BACK FROM THE READER--IT WAS BECAUSE ON THE THIRD DAY FROM THE PRESENT HE WAS TO PREACH THE ELECTION SERMON
MEANWHILE NEVERTHELESS IT WAS SAD TO THINK OF THE PERCHANCE MORTAL AGONY THROUGH WHICH HE MUST STRUGGLE TOWARDS HIS TRIUMPH
THE DOLL SEATED IN HER LITTLE WICKER CARRIAGE
IT NEEDED ONLY TO KNOW THE SPRING THAT CONTROLLED THE ENGINE
DOTH THY SENTENCE BIND THEE TO WEAR THE TOKEN IN THY SLEEP
THE CHILD AND MOTHER WERE ESTRANGED BUT THROUGH HESTER'S FAULT NOT PEARL'S
IN TRUTH HE WAS STARTLED IF NOT SHOCKED TO FIND THIS ATTRIBUTE IN THE PHYSICIAN
HE NOTICED HER INVOLUNTARY GESTURE AND SMILED
BUT IN DAYS TO COME HE WILL WALK HAND IN HAND WITH US
NEVER FROM THE SOIL OF NEW ENGLAND HAD GONE UP SUCH A SHOUT
HERE GONE THROUGH FAST AND VIGIL AND COME FORTH HALF ALIVE
DOOMED BY HIS OWN CHOICE THEREFORE AS MR DIMMESDALE SO EVIDENTLY WAS TO EAT HIS UNSAVOURY MORSEL ALWAYS AT ANOTHER'S BOARD AND ENDURE THE LIFE-LONG CHILL WHICH MUST BE HIS LOT WHO SEEKS TO WARM HIMSELF ONLY AT ANOTHER'S FIRESIDE IT TRULY SEEMED THAT THIS SAGACIOUS EXPERIENCED BENEVOLENT OLD PHYSICIAN WITH HIS CONCORD OF PATERNAL AND REVERENTIAL LOVE FOR THE YOUNG PASTOR WAS THE VERY MAN OF ALL MANKIND TO BE CONSTANTLY WITHIN REACH OF HIS VOICE
HESTER SAID HE HAST THOU FOUND PEACE SHE SMILED DREARILY LOOKING DOWN UPON HER BOSOM
BUT HER HESITATION WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANT THOUGH LONG ENOUGH TO DISPLAY A SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST
IT WAS NOT AN AGE OF DELICACY
IN FINE HESTER PRYNNE RESOLVED TO MEET HER FORMER HUSBAND AND DO WHAT MIGHT BE IN HER POWER FOR THE RESCUE OF THE VICTIM ON WHOM HE HAD SO EVIDENTLY SET HIS GRIPE
BUT SHE WILL LOVE THEE DEARLY AND THOU HER
POKING AND BURROWING INTO THE HEAPED-UP RUBBISH IN THE CORNER UNFOLDING ONE AND ANOTHER DOCUMENT AND READING THE NAMES OF VESSELS THAT HAD LONG AGO FOUNDERED AT SEA OR ROTTED AT THE WHARVES AND THOSE OF MERCHANTS NEVER HEARD OF NOW ON CHANGE NOR VERY READILY DECIPHERABLE ON THEIR MOSSY TOMBSTONES
AND TURNING TO GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WHISPERED THIS IS THE SELFSAME CHILD OF WHOM WE HAVE HELD SPEECH TOGETHER
THERE INDEED WAS EACH FORMER TRACE OF THE STREET AS HE REMEMBERED IT AND ALL THE PECULIARITIES OF THE HOUSES WITH THE DUE MULTITUDE OF GABLE-PEAKS AND A WEATHER-COCK AT EVERY POINT WHERE HIS MEMORY SUGGESTED ONE
SEEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH HESTER PRYNNE--KINDLY AS SO MANY NOW FELT TOWARDS THE LATTER--THE DREAD INSPIRED BY MISTRESS HIBBINS HAD DOUBLED AND CAUSED A GENERAL MOVEMENT FROM THAT PART OF THE MARKET-PLACE IN WHICH THE TWO WOMEN STOOD
THE VERY IDEAL OF IGNOMINY WAS EMBODIED AND MADE MANIFEST IN THIS CONTRIVANCE OF WOOD AND IRON
CLERGYMEN PAUSED IN THE STREETS TO ADDRESS WORDS OF EXHORTATION THAT BROUGHT A CROWD WITH ITS MINGLED GRIN AND FROWN AROUND THE POOR SINFUL WOMAN
DIDST THOU EVER MEET THE BLACK MAN MOTHER AND WHO TOLD YOU THIS STORY PEARL ASKED HER MOTHER RECOGNISING A COMMON SUPERSTITION OF THE PERIOD
HERE BEFORE HIS OWN WIFE HAS GREETED HIM YOU MAY GREET THE SEA-FLUSHED SHIP-MASTER JUST IN PORT WITH HIS VESSEL'S PAPERS UNDER HIS ARM IN A TARNISHED TIN BOX
SO WOULD THE NEXT DAY AND SO WOULD THE NEXT
WERE SUCH A MAN ONCE MORE TO FALL WHAT PLEA COULD BE URGED IN EXTENUATION OF HIS CRIME
CRITICISING ALL WITH HARDLY MORE REVERENCE THAN THE INDIAN WOULD FEEL FOR THE CLERICAL BAND THE JUDICIAL ROBE THE PILLORY THE GALLOWS THE FIRESIDE OR THE CHURCH
AND NOW--BECAUSE BEYOND MY DESERTS I WAS HAPPY ENOUGH TO FIND A LISTENER OR TWO ON THE FORMER OCCASION--I AGAIN SEIZE THE PUBLIC BY THE BUTTON AND TALK OF MY THREE YEARS EXPERIENCE IN A CUSTOM-HOUSE
IT IS NOW NEARLY TWO CENTURIES AND A QUARTER SINCE THE ORIGINAL BRITON THE EARLIEST EMIGRANT OF MY NAME MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE WILD AND FOREST-BORDERED SETTLEMENT WHICH HAS SINCE BECOME A CITY
THE OLD INSPECTOR WAS INCAPABLE OF IT
FIELD'S YESTERDAYS WITH AUTHORS 1873 G
IN ALL HER INTERCOURSE WITH SOCIETY HOWEVER THERE WAS NOTHING THAT MADE HER FEEL AS IF SHE BELONGED TO IT
THROUGHOUT ALL HOWEVER THERE WAS A TRAIT OF PASSION A CERTAIN DEPTH OF HUE WHICH SHE NEVER LOST
THIS ENVELOPE HAD THE AIR OF AN OFFICIAL RECORD OF SOME PERIOD LONG PAST WHEN CLERKS ENGROSSED THEIR STIFF AND FORMAL CHIROGRAPHY ON MORE SUBSTANTIAL MATERIALS THAN AT PRESENT
AND THEREFORE PEARL WHO WAS THE GEM ON HER MOTHER'S UNQUIET BOSOM BETRAYED BY THE VERY DANCE OF HER SPIRITS THE EMOTIONS WHICH NONE COULD DETECT IN THE MARBLE PASSIVENESS OF HESTER'S BROW
IT IS TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE THAT EXCEPT WHERE ITS SELFISHNESS IS BROUGHT INTO PLAY IT LOVES MORE READILY THAN IT HATES
THAT AND THY REPENTANCE MAY AVAIL TO TAKE THE SCARLET LETTER OFF THY BREAST NEVER REPLIED HESTER PRYNNE LOOKING NOT AT MR WILSON BUT INTO THE DEEP AND TROUBLED EYES OF THE YOUNGER CLERGYMAN
NOTHING IN HESTER'S BOSOM TO MAKE IT EVER AGAIN THE PILLOW OF AFFECTION
GO THEN AND EARN YOUR WAGES IN SHORT THE ALMOST TORPID CREATURES OF MY OWN FANCY TWITTED ME WITH IMBECILITY AND NOT WITHOUT FAIR OCCASION
UNDER THAT IMPULSE SHE HAD MADE HER CHOICE AND HAD CHOSEN AS IT NOW APPEARED THE MORE WRETCHED ALTERNATIVE OF THE TWO
BUT THE RED MEN WERE NOT SO INFREQUENT VISITORS OF THE ENGLISH SETTLEMENTS THAT ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ANY NOTICE FROM HESTER PRYNNE AT SUCH A TIME
BUT DO NOT STRAY FAR
ALWAYS ESPECIALLY A SENSE OF ANY TROUBLE OR IMPENDING REVOLUTION OF WHATEVER KIND IN DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES
WE FELT IT SO
REMEMBERING THEIR OWN FORMER HABITS THEY USED TO SAY THAT THE SURVEYOR WAS WALKING THE QUARTER-DECK
FOOLISH WOMAN RESPONDED THE PHYSICIAN HALF COLDLY HALF SOOTHINGLY
SHE THOUGHT OF THE DIM FOREST WITH ITS LITTLE DELL OF SOLITUDE AND LOVE AND ANGUISH AND THE MOSSY TREE-TRUNK WHERE SITTING HAND-IN-HAND THEY HAD MINGLED THEIR SAD AND PASSIONATE TALK WITH THE MELANCHOLY MURMUR OF THE BROOK
THE VULGAR WHO IN THOSE DREARY OLD TIMES WERE ALWAYS CONTRIBUTING A GROTESQUE HORROR TO WHAT INTERESTED THEIR IMAGINATIONS HAD A STORY ABOUT THE SCARLET LETTER WHICH WE MIGHT READILY WORK UP INTO A TERRIFIC LEGEND
SHE MARVELLED HOW SHE COULD EVER HAVE BEEN WROUGHT UPON TO MARRY HIM
THE PEOPLE LOOKED WITH AN UNSHAKEN HOPE TO SEE THE MINISTER COME FORTH OUT OF THE CONFLICT TRANSFIGURED WITH THE GLORY WHICH HE WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY WIN
AND NEITHER OF THEM WAS OF ONE WHIT MORE AVAIL THAN THE TWINKLE OF A TALLOW-CANDLE
NO MINSTREL WITH HIS HARP AND LEGENDARY BALLAD NOR GLEEMAN WITH AN APE DANCING TO HIS MUSIC
FOR SEVERAL DAYS HOWEVER SHE VAINLY SOUGHT AN OPPORTUNITY OF ADDRESSING HIM IN SOME OF THE MEDITATIVE WALKS WHICH SHE KNEW HIM TO BE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING ALONG THE SHORES OF THE PENINSULA OR ON THE WOODED HILLS OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY
THERE HE USED TO SIT GAZING WITH A SOMEWHAT DIM SERENITY OF ASPECT AT THE FIGURES THAT CAME AND WENT AMID THE RUSTLE OF PAPERS THE ADMINISTERING OF OATHS THE DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS AND THE CASUAL TALK OF THE OFFICE
EVEN THAT MIGHTY SWELL OF MANY VOICES BLENDED INTO ONE GREAT VOICE BY THE UNIVERSAL IMPULSE WHICH MAKES LIKEWISE ONE VAST HEART OUT OF THE MANY
THE VICTORY ACCOMPLISHED PEARL RETURNED QUIETLY TO HER MOTHER AND LOOKED UP SMILING INTO HER FACE
MEN BOLDER THAN THESE HAD OVERTHROWN AND REARRANGED--NOT ACTUALLY BUT WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THEORY WHICH WAS THEIR MOST REAL ABODE--THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT PREJUDICE WHEREWITH WAS LINKED MUCH OF ANCIENT PRINCIPLE
BORNE ON SUCH QUEER VEHICLE OF FAME A KNOWLEDGE OF MY EXISTENCE SO FAR AS A NAME CONVEYS IT WAS CARRIED WHERE IT HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE AND I HOPE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN
BY MEANS OF THEM THE SUFFERER'S CONSCIENCE HAD BEEN KEPT IN AN IRRITATED STATE THE TENDENCY OF WHICH WAS NOT TO CURE BY WHOLESOME PAIN BUT TO DISORGANIZE AND CORRUPT HIS SPIRITUAL BEING
HE SOON MANIFESTED HIS FAMILIARITY WITH THE PONDEROUS AND IMPOSING MACHINERY OF ANTIQUE PHYSIC
THOU WOULDST NOT PROMISE TO TAKE MY HAND AND MOTHER'S HAND TO-MORROW NOON-TIDE WORTHY SIR ANSWERED THE PHYSICIAN WHO HAD NOW ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE PLATFORM--"PIOUS MASTER DIMMESDALE
THE MINISTER'S OWN WILL AND HESTER'S WILL AND THE FATE THAT GREW BETWEEN THEM HAD WROUGHT THIS TRANSFORMATION
SO THAT THE MOULD OF FEATURES AND CAST OF CHARACTER WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN FAMILIAR HERE--EVER AS ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RACE LAY DOWN IN THE GRAVE ANOTHER ASSUMING AS IT WERE HIS SENTRY-MARCH ALONG THE MAIN STREET--MIGHT STILL IN MY LITTLE DAY BE SEEN AND RECOGNISED IN THE OLD TOWN
THERE WAS ALWAYS A PROPHETIC INSTINCT A LOW WHISPER IN MY EAR THAT WITHIN NO LONG PERIOD AND WHENEVER A NEW CHANGE OF CUSTOM SHOULD BE ESSENTIAL TO MY GOOD CHANGE WOULD COME
WHILE THE SURVEYOR--THOUGH SELDOM WHEN IT COULD BE AVOIDED TAKING UPON HIMSELF THE DIFFICULT TASK OF ENGAGING HIM IN CONVERSATION--WAS FOND OF STANDING AT A DISTANCE AND WATCHING HIS QUIET AND ALMOST SLUMBEROUS COUNTENANCE
MY GOOD TOWNSPEOPLE WILL NOT MUCH REGRET ME FOR--THOUGH IT HAS BEEN AS DEAR AN OBJECT AS ANY IN MY LITERARY EFFORTS TO BE OF SOME IMPORTANCE IN THEIR EYES AND TO WIN MYSELF A PLEASANT MEMORY IN THIS ABODE AND BURIAL-PLACE OF SO MANY OF MY FOREFATHERS--THERE HAS NEVER BEEN FOR ME THE GENIAL ATMOSPHERE WHICH A LITERARY MAN REQUIRES IN ORDER TO RIPEN THE BEST HARVEST OF HIS MIND
BUT WHAT DISTINGUISHED THE PHYSICIAN'S ECSTASY FROM SATAN'S WAS THE TRAIT OF WONDER IN IT
FEARING PERHAPS THAT WITH ITS NEVER-CEASING LOQUACITY IT SHOULD WHISPER TALES OUT OF THE HEART OF THE OLD FOREST WHENCE IT FLOWED OR MIRROR ITS REVELATIONS ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF A POOL
AND NOW SURROUNDED LIKE THE SAINT-LIKE PERSONAGE OF OLDEN TIMES WITH A RADIANT HALO THAT GLORIFIED HIM AMID THIS GLOOMY NIGHT OF SIN--AS IF THE DEPARTED GOVERNOR HAD LEFT HIM AN INHERITANCE OF HIS GLORY OR AS IF HE HAD CAUGHT UPON HIMSELF THE DISTANT SHINE OF THE CELESTIAL CITY WHILE LOOKING THITHERWARD TO SEE THE TRIUMPHANT PILGRIM PASS WITHIN ITS GATES--NOW IN SHORT GOOD FATHER WILSON WAS MOVING HOMEWARD AIDING HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH A LIGHTED LANTERN
NOR DID HE CONCEAL FROM HIS PATIENTS THAT THESE SIMPLE MEDICINES NATURE'S BOON TO THE UNTUTORED SAVAGE HAD QUITE AS LARGE A SHARE OF HIS OWN CONFIDENCE AS THE EUROPEAN PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH SO MANY LEARNED DOCTORS HAD SPENT CENTURIES IN ELABORATING
YOU INQUIRED OF ME A LITTLE TIME AGONE SAID HE AT LENGTH MY JUDGMENT AS TOUCHING YOUR HEALTH I DID ANSWERED THE CLERGYMAN AND WOULD GLADLY LEARN IT
IT WAS OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THAT ENTERED
NOW HOWEVER HER INTERVIEW WITH THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE ON THE NIGHT OF HIS VIGIL HAD GIVEN HER A NEW THEME OF REFLECTION AND HELD UP TO HER AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED WORTHY OF ANY EXERTION AND SACRIFICE FOR ITS ATTAINMENT
ROGER CHILLINGWORTH READILY ASSENTED AND WENT ON WITH HIS MEDICAL SUPERVISION OF THE MINISTER
THE VIRGINS OF HIS CHURCH GREW PALE AROUND HIM VICTIMS OF A PASSION SO IMBUED WITH RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT THAT THEY IMAGINED IT TO BE ALL RELIGION AND BROUGHT IT OPENLY IN THEIR WHITE BOSOMS AS THEIR MOST ACCEPTABLE SACRIFICE BEFORE THE ALTAR
HIS FAME HIS POSITION HIS LIFE WILL BE IN MY HANDS
I SHALL INDEED STAND WITH THY MOTHER AND THEE ONE OTHER DAY BUT NOT TO-MORROW PEARL LAUGHED AND ATTEMPTED TO PULL AWAY HER HAND
HE WAS AS MUCH OUT OF PLACE AS AN OLD SWORD--NOW RUSTY BUT WHICH HAD FLASHED ONCE IN THE BATTLE'S FRONT AND SHOWED STILL A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG ITS BLADE--WOULD HAVE BEEN AMONG THE INKSTANDS PAPER-FOLDERS AND MAHOGANY RULERS ON THE DEPUTY COLLECTOR'S DESK
POSSIBLY IT WAS AN INSTINCTIVE DEVICE OF HER SPIRIT TO RELIEVE ITSELF BY THE EXHIBITION OF THESE PHANTASMAGORIC FORMS FROM THE CRUEL WEIGHT AND HARDNESS OF THE REALITY
HOPEFULLY BUT A MOMENT AGO AS HESTER HAD SPOKEN OF DROWNING IT IN THE DEEP SEA THERE WAS A SENSE OF INEVITABLE DOOM UPON HER AS SHE THUS RECEIVED BACK THIS DEADLY SYMBOL FROM THE HAND OF FATE
HAD SEVEN LONG YEARS UNDER THE TORTURE OF THE SCARLET LETTER INFLICTED SO MUCH OF MISERY AND WROUGHT OUT NO REPENTANCE
WHEN THEY WERE FAIRLY IN THE MARKETPLACE THEIR PRESENCE WAS GREETED BY A SHOUT
PROMPT ACUTE CLEAR-MINDED
YOUR PARDON ONCE AGAIN GOOD SIR IF MY SPEECH GIVE THE SHADOW OF OFFENCE
THUS ON TAKING CHARGE OF MY DEPARTMENT I FOUND FEW BUT AGED MEN
BUT STILL METHINKS IT MUST NEEDS BE BETTER FOR THE SUFFERER TO BE FREE TO SHOW HIS PAIN AS THIS POOR WOMAN HESTER IS THAN TO COVER IT UP IN HIS HEART THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE AND THE PHYSICIAN BEGAN ANEW TO EXAMINE AND ARRANGE THE PLANTS WHICH HE HAD GATHERED
FOR THOUGH DIM IT HAD NOT THE IMBECILITY OF DECAYING AGE
THOU ART NO PEARL OF MINE SAID THE MOTHER HALF PLAYFULLY
HESTER WOULD NOT SET HIM FREE LEST HE SHOULD LOOK HER STERNLY IN THE FACE
NOT IMPROBABLY IT WAS TO THIS LATTER CLASS OF MEN THAT MR DIMMESDALE BY MANY OF HIS TRAITS OF CHARACTER NATURALLY BELONGED
IT HAD REACHED HER EARS THAT THERE WAS A DESIGN ON THE PART OF SOME OF THE LEADING INHABITANTS CHERISHING THE MORE RIGID ORDER OF PRINCIPLES IN RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT TO DEPRIVE HER OF HER CHILD
IT WAS A SAD TRANSFORMATION TOO THAT HER RICH AND LUXURIANT HAIR HAD EITHER BEEN CUT OFF OR WAS SO COMPLETELY HIDDEN BY A CAP THAT NOT A SHINING LOCK OF IT EVER ONCE GUSHED INTO THE SUNSHINE
IT WAS MARVELLOUS TO OBSERVE HOW THE GHOSTS OF BYGONE MEALS WERE CONTINUALLY RISING UP BEFORE HIM--NOT IN ANGER OR RETRIBUTION BUT AS IF GRATEFUL FOR HIS FORMER APPRECIATION AND SEEKING TO REDUPLICATE AN ENDLESS SERIES OF ENJOYMENT AT ONCE SHADOWY AND SENSUAL
NEVER SO FAR AS I HAVE KNOWN DISGRACED BY A SINGLE UNWORTHY MEMBER
ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT PEARL AS ALREADY HINTED WAS OF DEMON ORIGIN THESE GOOD PEOPLE NOT UNREASONABLY ARGUED THAT A CHRISTIAN INTEREST IN THE MOTHER'S SOUL REQUIRED THEM TO REMOVE SUCH A STUMBLING-BLOCK FROM HER PATH
THE PICTURE ON THE WALL--ALL THESE DETAILS SO COMPLETELY SEEN ARE SO SPIRITUALISED BY THE UNUSUAL LIGHT THAT THEY SEEM TO LOSE THEIR ACTUAL SUBSTANCE AND BECOME THINGS OF INTELLECT
MY DOOM WAS ON ME
YET THERE WERE INTERVALS WHEN THE WHOLE SCENE IN WHICH SHE WAS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OBJECT SEEMED TO VANISH FROM HER EYES OR AT LEAST GLIMMERED INDISTINCTLY BEFORE THEM LIKE A MASS OF IMPERFECTLY SHAPED AND SPECTRAL IMAGES
I COULD DO NO BETTER FOR IT AS SHE STILL HESITATED BEING IN FACT IN NO REASONABLE STATE OF MIND HE TOOK THE INFANT IN HIS ARMS AND HIMSELF ADMINISTERED THE DRAUGHT
I FEARED THE WOMAN HAD NO BETTER THOUGHT THAN TO MAKE A MOUNTEBANK OF HER CHILD OH NOT SO!--NOT SO CONTINUED MR DIMMESDALE
HE NEEDED TO BASK HIMSELF IN THAT SMILE HE SAID IN ORDER THAT THE CHILL OF SO MANY LONELY HOURS AMONG HIS BOOKS MIGHT BE TAKEN OFF THE SCHOLAR'S HEART
BUT THERE STOOD ONE IN THE MIDST OF YOU AT WHOSE BRAND OF SIN AND INFAMY YE HAVE NOT SHUDDERED IT SEEMED AT THIS POINT AS IF THE MINISTER MUST LEAVE THE REMAINDER OF HIS SECRET UNDISCLOSED
THERE WAS HIS BODY MOVING ONWARD AND WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED FORCE
O FIEND WHOSE TALISMAN WAS THAT FATAL SYMBOL WOULDST THOU LEAVE NOTHING WHETHER IN YOUTH OR AGE FOR THIS POOR SINNER TO REVERE?--SUCH LOSS OF FAITH IS EVER ONE OF THE SADDEST RESULTS OF SIN
HESTER PRYNNE--WHOSE VOCATION AS A SELF-ENLISTED SISTER OF CHARITY HAD BROUGHT HER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAPTAIN AND CREW--COULD TAKE UPON HERSELF TO SECURE THE PASSAGE OF TWO INDIVIDUALS AND A CHILD WITH ALL THE SECRECY WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES RENDERED MORE THAN DESIRABLE
HADST THOU SOUGHT THE WHOLE EARTH OVER SAID HE LOOKING DARKLY AT THE CLERGYMAN THERE WAS NO ONE PLACE SO SECRET--NO HIGH PLACE NOR LOWLY PLACE WHERE THOU COULDST HAVE ESCAPED ME--SAVE ON THIS VERY SCAFFOLD THANKS BE TO HIM WHO HATH LED ME HITHER ANSWERED THE MINISTER
BUT AS MATTERS STAND WITH MY SOUL WHATEVER OF GOOD CAPACITY THERE ORIGINALLY WAS IN ME ALL OF GOD'S GIFTS THAT WERE THE CHOICEST HAVE BECOME THE MINISTERS OF SPIRITUAL TORMENT
THEN HOWEVER THERE WAS THE FRESHNESS OF THE PASSING YEAR ON ITS EXTERIOR AND THE CHEERFULNESS GLEAMING FORTH FROM THE SUNNY WINDOWS OF A HUMAN HABITATION INTO WHICH DEATH HAD NEVER ENTERED
BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL DISCOVERS A REVELATION ADDRESSED TO HIMSELF ALONE ON THE SAME VAST SHEET OF RECORD
IS IT BECAUSE WHEN THE MINISTER WROTE HIS NAME IN THE BOOK THE BLACK MAN SET HIS MARK IN THAT PLACE
SO WE MAY BOTH DIE AND LITTLE PEARL DIE WITH US FOR THEE AND PEARL BE IT AS GOD SHALL ORDER SAID THE MINISTER
ONCE THIS FREAKISH ELVISH CAST CAME INTO THE CHILD'S EYES WHILE HESTER WAS LOOKING AT HER OWN IMAGE IN THEM AS MOTHERS ARE FOND OF DOING
BUT IT WERE IRREVERENT TO DESCRIBE THAT REVELATION
BUT HE SEEMED TO STAND APART AND EYE THIS FORMER SELF WITH SCORNFUL PITYING BUT HALF-ENVIOUS CURIOSITY
THERE IS NO GOOD FOR HIM NO GOOD FOR ME NO GOOD FOR THEE
SO THAT AT EVERY GLANCE YOU FIND A SMALLER AND LESS VOLATILE RESIDUUM
BUT TO ALL THESE SHADOWY BEINGS SO LONG OUR NEAR ACQUAINTANCES--AS WELL ROGER CHILLINGWORTH AS HIS COMPANIONS WE WOULD FAIN BE MERCIFUL
AT LAST WHILE ATTENDING A SICK CHAMBER WHITHER THE REV
THAT LITTLE CREATURE WHOSE INNOCENT LIFE HAD SPRUNG BY THE INSCRUTABLE DECREE OF PROVIDENCE A LOVELY AND IMMORTAL FLOWER OUT OF THE RANK LUXURIANCE OF A GUILTY PASSION
THERE WAS SOME SHADOW OF AN ATTEMPT OF THIS KIND IN THE MODE OF CELEBRATING THE DAY ON WHICH THE POLITICAL YEAR OF THE COLONY COMMENCED
HE SEEMED AWAY FROM US ALTHOUGH WE SAW HIM BUT A FEW YARDS OFF
HUSH CHILD--HUSH SAID HER MOTHER EARNESTLY
HERE HAD BEEN HER SIN
ALL WHICH SOUNDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SEEMED BUT INDISTINCTLY TO IMPRESS HIS SENSES AND HARDLY TO MAKE THEIR WAY INTO HIS INNER SPHERE OF CONTEMPLATION
IN THE DARK NIGHTTIME HE CALLS US TO HIM AND HOLDS THY HAND AND MINE AS WHEN WE STOOD WITH HIM ON THE SCAFFOLD YONDER
IN FACT THIS SCAFFOLD CONSTITUTED A PORTION OF A PENAL MACHINE WHICH NOW FOR TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS PAST HAS BEEN MERELY HISTORICAL AND TRADITIONARY AMONG US BUT WAS HELD IN THE OLD TIME TO BE AS EFFECTUAL AN AGENT IN THE PROMOTION OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP AS EVER WAS THE GUILLOTINE AMONG THE TERRORISTS OF FRANCE
MANY CHARACTERISTICS--AND THOSE TOO WHICH CONTRIBUTE NOT THE LEAST FORCIBLY TO IMPART RESEMBLANCE IN A SKETCH--MUST HAVE VANISHED OR BEEN OBSCURED BEFORE I MET THE GENERAL
THERE WAS A LISTLESSNESS IN HIS GAIT AS IF HE SAW NO REASON FOR TAKING ONE STEP FURTHER NOR FELT ANY DESIRE TO DO SO BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD COULD HE BE GLAD OF ANYTHING TO FLING HIMSELF DOWN AT THE ROOT OF THE NEAREST TREE AND LIE THERE PASSIVE FOR EVERMORE
THE GREAT SCENE OF GRIEF IN WHICH THE WILD INFANT BORE A PART HAD DEVELOPED ALL HER SYMPATHIES
THERE WERE HUMAN BEINGS ENOUGH AND ENOUGH OF HIGHLY WROUGHT AND SYMPHONIOUS FEELING TO PRODUCE THAT MORE IMPRESSIVE SOUND THAN THE ORGAN TONES OF THE BLAST OR THE THUNDER OR THE ROAR OF THE SEA
THE SCENE WAS NOT WITHOUT A MIXTURE OF AWE SUCH AS MUST ALWAYS INVEST THE SPECTACLE OF GUILT AND SHAME IN A FELLOW-CREATURE BEFORE SOCIETY SHALL HAVE GROWN CORRUPT ENOUGH TO SMILE INSTEAD OF SHUDDERING AT IT
WITH CALM AND INTENT SCRUTINY HE FELT HER PULSE LOOKED INTO HER EYES--A GAZE THAT MADE HER HEART SHRINK AND SHUDDER BECAUSE SO FAMILIAR AND YET SO STRANGE AND COLD--AND FINALLY SATISFIED WITH HIS INVESTIGATION PROCEEDED TO MINGLE ANOTHER DRAUGHT
THE STREET AND THE MARKET-PLACE ABSOLUTELY BABBLED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WITH APPLAUSES OF THE MINISTER
ON THIS EVENTFUL DAY MOREOVER THERE WAS A CERTAIN SINGULAR INQUIETUDE AND EXCITEMENT IN HER MOOD RESEMBLING NOTHING SO MUCH AS THE SHIMMER OF A DIAMOND THAT SPARKLES AND FLASHES WITH THE VARIED THROBBINGS OF THE BREAST ON WHICH IT IS DISPLAYED
BUT WITH WHAT A WILD LOOK OF WONDER JOY AND HORROR
AND SURELY THOU WORKEST GOOD AMONG THEM
OF PENITENCE THERE HAS BEEN NONE
WHEN THEY FOUND VOICE TO SPEAK IT WAS AT FIRST ONLY TO UTTER REMARKS AND INQUIRIES SUCH AS ANY TWO ACQUAINTANCES MIGHT HAVE MADE ABOUT THE GLOOMY SKY THE THREATENING STORM AND NEXT THE HEALTH OF EACH
IF SHE SURVIVE THE TENDERNESS WILL EITHER BE CRUSHED OUT OF HER OR--AND THE OUTWARD SEMBLANCE IS THE SAME--CRUSHED SO DEEPLY INTO HER HEART THAT IT CAN NEVER SHOW ITSELF MORE
BY THOSE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH HIS HABITS THE PALENESS OF THE YOUNG MINISTER'S CHEEK WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY HIS TOO EARNEST DEVOTION TO STUDY HIS SCRUPULOUS FULFILMENT OF PAROCHIAL DUTY AND MORE THAN ALL TO THE FASTS AND VIGILS OF WHICH HE MADE A FREQUENT PRACTICE IN ORDER TO KEEP THE GROSSNESS OF THIS EARTHLY STATE FROM CLOGGING AND OBSCURING HIS SPIRITUAL LAMP
FOR THE SAKE OF THE MINISTER'S HEALTH AND TO ENABLE THE LEECH TO GATHER PLANTS WITH HEALING BALM IN THEM THEY TOOK LONG WALKS ON THE SEA-SHORE OR IN THE FOREST
SHE SEEMED CONSCIOUS INDEED THAT WHATEVER SYMPATHY SHE MIGHT EXPECT LAY IN THE LARGER AND WARMER HEART OF THE MULTITUDE
IT WOULD BE GREATLY FOR THE PUBLIC BEHOOF IF WE WOMEN BEING OF MATURE AGE AND CHURCH-MEMBERS IN GOOD REPUTE SHOULD HAVE THE HANDLING OF SUCH MALEFACTRESSES AS THIS HESTER PRYNNE
XII
THE FROWN THE HARSH REBUKE THE FREQUENT APPLICATION OF THE ROD ENJOINED BY SCRIPTURAL AUTHORITY WERE USED NOT MERELY IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR ACTUAL OFFENCES BUT AS A WHOLESOME REGIMEN FOR THE GROWTH AND PROMOTION OF ALL CHILDISH VIRTUES
THE WOMAN OF THE SCARLET LETTER IN THE MARKETPLACE
SHE BORE IN HER ARMS A CHILD A BABY OF SOME THREE MONTHS OLD WHO WINKED AND TURNED ASIDE ITS LITTLE FACE FROM THE TOO VIVID LIGHT OF DAY
SHE GREW TO HAVE A DREAD OF CHILDREN
LOST AS MY OWN SOUL IS I WOULD STILL DO WHAT I MAY FOR OTHER HUMAN SOULS
AND--WHAT ATTRACTED MOST INTEREST OF ALL--ON THE PLATFORM OF THE PILLORY ALREADY SO NOTED IN OUR PAGES TWO MASTERS OF DEFENCE WERE COMMENCING AN EXHIBITION WITH THE BUCKLER AND BROADSWORD
AND ONLY WONDERED THAT HEAVEN SHOULD SEE FIT TO TRANSMIT THE GRAND AND SOLEMN MUSIC OF ITS ORACLES THROUGH SO FOUL AN ORGAN PIPE AS HE
UNLESS PEOPLE ARE MORE THAN COMMONLY DISAGREEABLE IT IS MY FOOLISH HABIT TO CONTRACT A KINDNESS FOR THEM
THEN WHAT WAS HE?--A SUBSTANCE?--OR THE DIMMEST OF ALL SHADOWS
HAD THE FOREST STILL KEPT ITS GLOOM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BRIGHT IN HESTER'S EYES AND BRIGHT IN ARTHUR DIMMESDALE'S
AS NOT ONLY THE DISEASE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN BUT HE WAS STRONGLY MOVED TO LOOK INTO THE CHARACTER AND QUALITIES OF THE PATIENT THESE TWO MEN SO DIFFERENT IN AGE CAME GRADUALLY TO SPEND MUCH TIME TOGETHER
WILT THOU GIVE UP THAT ONLY PRIVILEGE
THERE WAS A REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE IN HIS FEATURES AS OF A PERSON WHO HAD SO CULTIVATED HIS MENTAL PART THAT IT COULD NOT FAIL TO MOULD THE PHYSICAL TO ITSELF AND BECOME MANIFEST BY UNMISTAKABLE TOKENS
DAY BY DAY NEVERTHELESS THEIR SOUR AND RIGID WRINKLES WERE RELAXING INTO SOMETHING WHICH IN THE DUE COURSE OF YEARS MIGHT GROW TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF ALMOST BENEVOLENCE
EACH RENDERS ONE INDIVIDUAL DEPENDENT FOR THE FOOD OF HIS AFFECTIONS AND SPIRITUAL FIFE UPON ANOTHER
WHY NOT ANNOUNCE THYSELF OPENLY AND CAST ME OFF AT ONCE IT MAY BE HE REPLIED BECAUSE I WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THE DISHONOUR THAT BESMIRCHES THE HUSBAND OF A FAITHLESS WOMAN
IF THE IMAGINATIVE FACULTY REFUSED TO ACT AT SUCH AN HOUR IT MIGHT WELL BE DEEMED A HOPELESS CASE
BUT HE KNEW NOT THAT THE EYE AND HAND WERE MINE
WHY SHOULD HE TOIL AND MOIL AND BE AT SO MUCH TROUBLE TO PICK HIMSELF UP OUT OF THE MUD WHEN IN A LITTLE WHILE HENCE THE STRONG ARM OF HIS UNCLE WILL RAISE AND SUPPORT HIM
LO THE SCARLET LETTER WHICH HESTER WEARS
IN THE LITTLE CHAOS OF PEARL'S CHARACTER THERE MIGHT BE SEEN EMERGING AND COULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE VERY FIRST--THE STEADFAST PRINCIPLES OF AN UNFLINCHING COURAGE--AN UNCONTROLLABLE WILL--STURDY PRIDE WHICH MIGHT BE DISCIPLINED INTO SELF-RESPECT--AND A BITTER SCORN OF MANY THINGS WHICH WHEN EXAMINED MIGHT BE FOUND TO HAVE THE TAINT OF FALSEHOOD IN THEM
BUT SHE NAMED THE INFANT PEARL AS BEING OF GREAT PRICE--PURCHASED WITH ALL SHE HAD--HER MOTHER'S ONLY TREASURE
PACIFY HER IF THOU LOVEST ME HESTER TURNED AGAIN TOWARDS PEARL WITH A CRIMSON BLUSH UPON HER CHEEK A CONSCIOUS GLANCE ASIDE CLERGYMAN AND THEN A HEAVY SIGH WHILE EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO SPEAK THE BLUSH YIELDED TO A DEADLY PALLOR
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT AS I CAME OUT OF THE VAST AND DISMAL FOREST AND ENTERED THIS SETTLEMENT OF CHRISTIAN MEN THE VERY FIRST OBJECT TO MEET MY EYES WOULD BE THYSELF HESTER PRYNNE STANDING UP A STATUE OF IGNOMINY BEFORE THE PEOPLE
WERE I AN ATHEIST--A MAN DEVOID OF CONSCIENCE--A WRETCH WITH COARSE AND BRUTAL INSTINCTS--I MIGHT HAVE FOUND PEACE LONG ERE NOW
WHY THE DEGENERATE FELLOW MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN A FIDDLER SUCH ARE THE COMPLIMENTS BANDIED BETWEEN MY GREAT GRANDSIRES AND MYSELF ACROSS THE GULF OF TIME
IT MUST AT ANY PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HAVE REQUIRED AN IMPULSE TO SET HIM IN MOTION
SO DETERMINED WAS HE TO SPEAK OUT THE WHOLE
IS THERE NOT LAW FOR IT
FROM FIRST TO LAST IN SHORT HESTER PRYNNE HAD ALWAYS THIS DREADFUL AGONY IN FEELING A HUMAN EYE UPON THE TOKEN
WERE IT GOD'S WILL SAID THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE WHEN IN FULFILMENT OF THIS PLEDGE HE REQUESTED OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S PROFESSIONAL ADVICE I COULD BE WELL CONTENT THAT MY LABOURS AND MY SORROWS AND MY SINS AND MY PAINS SHOULD SHORTLY END WITH ME AND WHAT IS EARTHLY OF THEM BE BURIED IN MY GRAVE AND THE SPIRITUAL GO WITH ME TO MY ETERNAL STATE RATHER THAN THAT YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR SKILL TO THE PROOF IN MY BEHALF AH REPLIED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WITH THAT QUIETNESS WHICH WHETHER IMPOSED OR NATURAL MARKED ALL HIS DEPORTMENT IT IS THUS THAT A YOUNG CLERGYMAN IS APT TO SPEAK
OF THE FACT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT AND EXAMINING MYSELF AND OTHERS I WAS LED TO CONCLUSIONS IN REFERENCE TO THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC OFFICE ON THE CHARACTER NOT VERY FAVOURABLE TO THE MODE OF LIFE IN QUESTION
NO SENSIBLE MAN IT WAS CONFESSED COULD DOUBT ON WHICH SIDE THE VICTORY WOULD TURN
PAGE MEMOIR OF N
THE SINGULARITY LAY IN THE HOSTILE FEELINGS WITH WHICH THE CHILD REGARDED ALL THESE OFFSPRINGS OF HER OWN HEART AND MIND
UNATTAINABLE THOUGH WE MIGHT HAVE STRETCHED FORTH OUR HANDS AND TOUCHED HIS OWN
THE ELF-CHILD AND THE MINISTER CHAPTER IX
THE PENALTY THEREOF IS DEATH
THE MINISTER WAS GLAD TO HAVE REACHED THIS SHELTER WITHOUT FIRST BETRAYING HIMSELF TO THE WORLD BY ANY OF THOSE STRANGE AND WICKED ECCENTRICITIES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY IMPELLED WHILE PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS
NOT TO THEE
BUT RATHER A DEEP RED GLOW AS OF IRON IN A FURNACE
BUT ON ONE SIDE OF THE PORTAL AND ROOTED ALMOST AT THE THRESHOLD WAS A WILD ROSE-BUSH COVERED IN THIS MONTH OF JUNE WITH ITS DELICATE GEMS WHICH MIGHT BE IMAGINED TO OFFER THEIR FRAGRANCE AND FRAGILE BEAUTY TO THE PRISONER AS HE WENT IN AND TO THE CONDEMNED CRIMINAL AS HE CAME FORTH TO HIS DOOM IN TOKEN THAT THE DEEP HEART OF NATURE COULD PITY AND BE KIND TO HIM
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE LIKE GRISLY SENSE OF THE HUMOROUS AGAIN STOLE IN AMONG THE SOLEMN PHANTOMS OF HIS THOUGHT
NOT THE LESS HOWEVER THE GREAT HONEST FACE OF THE PEOPLE SMILED--GRIMLY PERHAPS BUT WIDELY TOO
BUT THIS LONG DEBT OF CONFIDENCE DUE FROM ME TO HIM WHOSE BANE AND RUIN I HAVE BEEN SHALL AT LENGTH BE PAID
HE HAD BEGUN AN INVESTIGATION AS HE IMAGINED WITH THE SEVERE AND EQUAL INTEGRITY OF A JUDGE DESIROUS ONLY OF TRUTH EVEN AS IF THE QUESTION INVOLVED NO MORE THAN THE AIR-DRAWN LINES AND FIGURES OF A GEOMETRICAL PROBLEM INSTEAD OF HUMAN PASSIONS AND WRONGS INFLICTED ON HIMSELF
WHAT MAY BE THE RESULT I KNOW NOT
THE FOUNDERS OF A NEW COLONY WHATEVER UTOPIA OF HUMAN VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS THEY MIGHT ORIGINALLY PROJECT HAVE INVARIABLY RECOGNISED IT AMONG THEIR EARLIEST PRACTICAL NECESSITIES TO ALLOT A PORTION OF THE VIRGIN SOIL AS A CEMETERY AND ANOTHER PORTION AS THE SITE OF A PRISON
IT SEEMED ON THE CONTRARY TO GROW MORE SENSITIVE WITH DAILY TORTURE
MUST I SINK DOWN THERE AND DIE AT ONCE ALAS
PEARL IMMEDIATELY TWINED IT AROUND HER NECK AND WAIST WITH SUCH HAPPY SKILL THAT ONCE SEEN THERE IT BECAME A PART OF HER AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HER WITHOUT IT
SHE HAD IN HER NATURE A RICH VOLUPTUOUS ORIENTAL CHARACTERISTIC--A TASTE FOR THE GORGEOUSLY BEAUTIFUL WHICH SAVE IN THE EXQUISITE PRODUCTIONS OF HER NEEDLE FOUND NOTHING ELSE IN ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF HER LIFE TO EXERCISE ITSELF UPON
IN NO STATE OF SOCIETY WOULD HE HAVE BEEN WHAT IS CALLED A MAN OF LIBERAL VIEWS
FOR A THOUSAND IMAGINARY FAULTS AND WENT ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WITH SWOLLEN EYELIDS THE NEXT MORNING
AND WHITHER WAS HE NOW GOING
HESTER AND THE PHYSICIAN HESTER BADE LITTLE PEARL RUN DOWN TO THE MARGIN OF THE WATER AND PLAY WITH THE SHELLS AND TANGLED SEA-WEED UNTIL SHE SHOULD HAVE TALKED AWHILE WITH YONDER GATHERER OF HERBS
THEY WILL NOT CLIMB MY KNEE NOR PRATTLE IN MY EAR NOR ANSWER TO MY SMILE BUT STAND APART AND EYE ME STRANGELY
ITS SPELL HOWEVER WAS STILL POTENT AND KEPT THE SCAFFOLD AWFUL WHERE THE POOR MINISTER HAD DIED AND LIKEWISE THE COTTAGE BY THE SEA-SHORE WHERE HESTER PRYNNE HAD DWELT
AND HE WAS ALREADY TREMBLING AT THE CONJUNCTION IN WHICH--WITH A STRANGE JOY NEVERTHELESS--HE NOW FOUND HIMSELF--"NOT SO MY CHILD
PERCEIVING A FLOCK OF BEACH-BIRDS THAT FED AND FLUTTERED ALONG THE SHORE THE NAUGHTY CHILD PICKED UP HER APRON FULL OF PEBBLES AND CREEPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK AFTER THESE SMALL SEA-FOWL DISPLAYED REMARKABLE DEXTERITY IN PELTING THEM
MEASURED BY THE PRISONER'S EXPERIENCE HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE RECKONED A JOURNEY OF SOME LENGTH
SHE COULD NO LONGER BORROW FROM THE FUTURE TO HELP HER THROUGH THE PRESENT GRIEF
HE THEREFORE STILL KEPT UP A FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITH HIM DAILY RECEIVING THE OLD PHYSICIAN IN HIS STUDY OR VISITING THE LABORATORY AND FOR RECREATION'S SAKE WATCHING THE PROCESSES BY WHICH WEEDS WERE CONVERTED INTO DRUGS OF POTENCY
LOOKING AT HIM MERELY AS AN ANIMAL--AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ELSE TO LOOK AT--HE WAS A MOST SATISFACTORY OBJECT FROM THE THOROUGH HEALTHFULNESS AND WHOLESOMENESS OF HIS SYSTEM AND HIS CAPACITY AT THAT EXTREME AGE TO ENJOY ALL OR NEARLY ALL THE DELIGHTS WHICH HE HAD EVER AIMED AT OR CONCEIVED OF
HIS GARMENTS WOULD RUSTLE
HE DESCRIBED HIM AS A MAN OF SKILL IN ALL CHRISTIAN MODES OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND LIKEWISE FAMILIAR WITH WHATEVER THE SAVAGE PEOPLE COULD TEACH IN RESPECT TO MEDICINAL HERBS AND ROOTS THAT GREW IN THE FOREST
THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE LITTLE PURITANS BEING OF THE MOST INTOLERANT BROOD THAT EVER LIVED HAD GOT A VAGUE IDEA OF SOMETHING OUTLANDISH UNEARTHLY OR AT VARIANCE WITH ORDINARY FASHIONS IN THE MOTHER AND CHILD AND THEREFORE SCORNED THEM IN THEIR HEARTS AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY REVILED THEM WITH THEIR TONGUES
ALWAYS TOO IN RESPECTABILITY
PRAY HASTEN HER FOR THIS DELAY HAS ALREADY IMPARTED A TREMOR TO MY NERVES COME DEAREST CHILD SAID HESTER ENCOURAGINGLY AND STRETCHING OUT BOTH HER ARMS
I HAD NOT HEARD OF IT XIII
WHEN HER ELF-CHILD HAD DEPARTED HESTER PRYNNE MADE A STEP OR TWO TOWARDS THE TRACK THAT LED THROUGH THE FOREST BUT STILL REMAINED UNDER THE DEEP SHADOW OF THE TREES
BUT EITHER SHE UNLOCKED IT OR THE DECAYING WOOD AND IRON YIELDED TO HER HAND OR SHE GLIDED SHADOW-LIKE THROUGH THESE IMPEDIMENTS--AND AT ALL EVENTS WENT IN
THE SUN BUT LITTLE PAST ITS MERIDIAN SHONE DOWN UPON THE CLERGYMAN AND GAVE A DISTINCTNESS TO HIS FIGURE AS HE STOOD OUT FROM ALL THE EARTH TO PUT IN HIS PLEA OF GUILTY AT THE BAR OF ETERNAL JUSTICE
I KNEW IT TOO BUT COULD NEVER QUITE FIND IN MY HEART TO ACT UPON THE KNOWLEDGE
IF HIS NOTICE WAS SOUGHT AN EXPRESSION OF COURTESY AND INTEREST GLEAMED OUT UPON HIS FEATURES PROVING THAT THERE WAS LIGHT WITHIN HIM AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THE OUTWARD MEDIUM OF THE INTELLECTUAL LAMP THAT OBSTRUCTED THE RAYS IN THEIR PASSAGE
THESE AFTER EXHAUSTING OTHER MODES OF AMUSEMENT NOW THRONGED ABOUT HESTER PRYNNE WITH RUDE AND BOORISH INTRUSIVENESS
AND NOW RATHER THAN HAVE HAD THIS GRIEVOUS WRONG TO CONFESS SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE LAID DOWN ON THE FOREST LEAVES AND DIED THERE AT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE'S FEET
FOR--LEAVING A HIGHER MOTIVE OUT OF THE QUESTION IT OFFERED INDUCEMENTS POWERFUL ENOUGH IN THE ALMOST WORSHIPPING RESPECT OF THE COMMUNITY TO WIN THE MOST ASPIRING AMBITION INTO ITS SERVICE
WHAT SEE YOU IN MY FACE ASKED THE PHYSICIAN THAT YOU LOOK AT IT SO EARNESTLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME WEEP IF THERE WERE ANY TEARS BITTER ENOUGH FOR IT ANSWERED SHE
WHAT DID IT BETOKEN
PERHAPS THERE WAS A MORE REAL TORTURE IN HER FIRST UNATTENDED FOOTSTEPS FROM THE THRESHOLD OF THE PRISON THAN EVEN IN THE PROCESSION AND SPECTACLE THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED WHERE SHE WAS MADE THE COMMON INFAMY AT WHICH ALL MANKIND WAS SUMMONED TO POINT ITS FINGER
OR RATHER LIKE THE FROZEN CALMNESS OF A DEAD WOMAN'S FEATURES
AND SO AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED HIS VISAGE WAS GETTING SOOTY WITH THE SMOKE
DID HE WISH TO DIE
YOU ARE BESIDE HIM SLEEPING AND WAKING
JUST WHERE SHE HAD PAUSED THE BROOK CHANCED TO FORM A POOL SO SMOOTH AND QUIET THAT IT REFLECTED A PERFECT IMAGE OF HER LITTLE FIGURE WITH ALL THE BRILLIANT PICTURESQUENESS OF HER BEAUTY IN ITS ADORNMENT OF FLOWERS AND WREATHED FOLIAGE BUT MORE REFINED AND SPIRITUALIZED THAN THE REALITY
FOR THOU ART CLAD IN GRAY AND WEAREST THE SCARLET LETTER
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING SAD UNUTTERABLY DREARY IN ALL THIS HAD I NOT BEEN CONSCIOUS THAT IT LAY AT MY OWN OPTION TO RECALL WHATEVER WAS VALUABLE IN THE PAST
ON EMERGING FROM THE OLD MANSE IT WAS CHIEFLY THIS STRANGE INDOLENT UNJOYOUS ATTACHMENT FOR MY NATIVE TOWN THAT BROUGHT ME TO FILL A PLACE IN UNCLE SAM'S BRICK EDIFICE WHEN I MIGHT AS WELL OR BETTER HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE
FROM THE LOFTIEST POINT OF ITS ROOF DURING PRECISELY THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF EACH FORENOON FLOATS OR DROOPS IN BREEZE OR CALM THE BANNER OF THE REPUBLIC
THIS WAS MY ALL OF LETTERED INTERCOURSE
A TENDERLOIN OF BEEF A HIND-QUARTER OF VEAL A SPARE-RIB OF PORK A PARTICULAR CHICKEN OR A REMARKABLY PRAISEWORTHY TURKEY WHICH HAD PERHAPS ADORNED HIS BOARD IN THE DAYS OF THE ELDER ADAMS WOULD BE REMEMBERED
HE BECAME THENCEFORTH NOT A SPECTATOR ONLY BUT A CHIEF ACTOR IN THE POOR MINISTER'S INTERIOR WORLD
IT WAS AS IF A WINDOW WERE THROWN OPEN ADMITTING A FREER ATMOSPHERE INTO THE CLOSE AND STIFLED STUDY WHERE HIS LIFE WAS WASTING ITSELF AWAY AMID LAMP-LIGHT OR OBSTRUCTED DAY-BEAMS AND THE MUSTY FRAGRANCE BE IT SENSUAL OR MORAL THAT EXHALES FROM BOOKS
IT WILL NOT FLEE FROM ME--FOR I WEAR NOTHING ON MY BOSOM YET NOR EVER WILL MY CHILD I HOPE SAID HESTER
WE MAY SPEAK FURTHER OF IT HEREAFTER
ALL THAT GUILTY SORROW HIDDEN FROM THE WORLD WHOSE GREAT HEART WOULD HAVE PITIED AND FORGIVEN TO BE REVEALED TO HIM THE PITILESS--TO HIM THE UNFORGIVING
SHE WAS FAIR AND PURE AS A LILY THAT HAD BLOOMED IN PARADISE
BUT HESTER OUGHT LONG AGO TO HAVE DONE WITH THIS INJUSTICE
IT MIGHT BE ON THIS ONE DAY THAT THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION UNSEEN BEFORE NOR INDEED VIVID ENOUGH TO BE DETECTED NOW
THE PATHWAY AMONG THE WOODS SEEMED WILDER MORE UNCOUTH WITH ITS RUDE NATURAL OBSTACLES AND LESS TRODDEN BY THE FOOT OF MAN THAN HE REMEMBERED IT ON HIS OUTWARD JOURNEY
A LOUD OR LOW EXPRESSION OF ANGUISH--THE WHISPER OR THE SHRIEK AS IT MIGHT BE CONCEIVED OF SUFFERING HUMANITY THAT TOUCHED A SENSIBILITY IN EVERY BOSOM
PERADVENTURE HADST THOU MET EARLIER WITH A BETTER LOVE THAN MINE THIS EVIL HAD NOT BEEN
POSSIBLY SHE WENT UP AMONG THE CLOUDS
AND SO HESTER I DREW THEE INTO MY HEART INTO ITS INNERMOST CHAMBER AND SOUGHT TO WARM THEE BY THE WARMTH WHICH THY PRESENCE MADE THERE I HAVE GREATLY WRONGED THEE MURMURED HESTER
IT WAS A MAIDEN NEWLY-WON--AND WON BY THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE'S OWN SERMON ON THE SABBATH AFTER HIS VIGIL--TO BARTER THE TRANSITORY PLEASURES OF THE WORLD FOR THE HEAVENLY HOPE THAT WAS TO ASSUME BRIGHTER SUBSTANCE AS LIFE GREW DARK AROUND HER AND WHICH WOULD GILD THE UTTER GLOOM WITH FINAL GLORY
THE EDIFICE HAD SO VERY STRANGE AND YET SO FAMILIAR AN ASPECT THAT MR DIMMESDALE'S MIND VIBRATED BETWEEN TWO IDEAS
THIS LEARNED STRANGER WAS EXEMPLARY AS REGARDED AT LEAST THE OUTWARD FORMS OF A RELIGIOUS LIFE
WHILE HESTER STOOD IN THAT MAGIC CIRCLE OF IGNOMINY WHERE THE CUNNING CRUELTY OF HER SENTENCE SEEMED TO HAVE FIXED HER FOR EVER THE ADMIRABLE PREACHER WAS LOOKING DOWN FROM THE SACRED PULPIT UPON AN AUDIENCE WHOSE VERY INMOST SPIRITS HAD YIELDED TO HIS CONTROL
WHEN THE WHOLE HAD GONE BY SHE LOOKED UP INTO HESTER'S FACE MOTHER SAID SHE WAS THAT THE SAME MINISTER THAT KISSED ME BY THE BROOK HOLD THY PEACE DEAR LITTLE PEARL WHISPERED HER MOTHER
AFTER MY FELLOWSHIP OF TOIL AND IMPRACTICABLE SCHEMES WITH THE DREAMY BRETHREN OF BROOK FARM
AND HE WILL TEACH THEE MANY THINGS AND LOVE THEE DEARLY
HESTER AND PEARL SO ROGER CHILLINGWORTH--A DEFORMED OLD FIGURE WITH A FACE THAT HAUNTED MEN'S MEMORIES LONGER THAN THEY LIKED--TOOK LEAVE OF HESTER PRYNNE AND WENT STOOPING AWAY ALONG THE EARTH
HE POSSESSED NO POWER OF THOUGHT NO DEPTH OF FEELING NO TROUBLESOME SENSIBILITIES
MY OWN HEAD WAS THE FIRST THAT FELL
AND A FACE WHICH BESIDES BEING BEAUTIFUL FROM REGULARITY OF FEATURE AND RICHNESS OF COMPLEXION HAD THE IMPRESSIVENESS BELONGING TO A MARKED BROW AND DEEP BLACK EYES
IN THE SECOND STOREY OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE THERE IS A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH THE BRICK-WORK AND NAKED RAFTERS HAVE NEVER BEEN COVERED WITH PANELLING AND PLASTER
PEOPLE OF NEW ENGLAND CRIED HE WITH A VOICE THAT ROSE OVER THEM HIGH SOLEMN AND MAJESTIC--YET HAD ALWAYS A TREMOR THROUGH IT AND SOMETIMES A SHRIEK STRUGGLING UP OUT OF A FATHOMLESS DEPTH OF REMORSE AND WOE--"YE THAT HAVE LOVED ME!--YE THAT HAVE DEEMED ME HOLY!--BEHOLD ME HERE THE ONE SINNER OF THE WORLD
DO ANYTHING SAVE TO LIE DOWN AND DIE
HIS COUNTENANCE IN THIS REPOSE WAS MILD AND KINDLY
THE ACCIDENTS OF MY LIFE HAVE OFTEN AFFORDED ME THIS ADVANTAGE BUT NEVER WITH MORE FULNESS AND VARIETY THAN DURING MY CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE
IT IS OF YONDER MISERABLE MAN THAT I WOULD SPEAK AND WHAT OF HIM CRIED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH EAGERLY AS IF HE LOVED THE TOPIC AND WERE GLAD OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IT WITH THE ONLY PERSON OF WHOM HE COULD MAKE A CONFIDANT
NOT A MOMENT'S CALM ENJOYMENT OF HER
AND IT BEING HARDLY IN THE NATURE OF A PUBLIC OFFICER TO RESIGN--IT WAS MY CHIEF TROUBLE THEREFORE THAT I WAS LIKELY TO GROW GREY AND DECREPIT IN THE SURVEYORSHIP AND BECOME MUCH SUCH ANOTHER ANIMAL AS THE OLD INSPECTOR
BUT IT WAS THE CONSTANT SHADOW OF MY PRESENCE THE CLOSEST PROPINQUITY OF THE MAN WHOM HE HAD MOST VILELY WRONGED AND WHO HAD GROWN TO EXIST ONLY BY THIS PERPETUAL POISON OF THE DIREST REVENGE
YET MY REFLECTIONS WERE NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE
IN THEIR EYES THE VERY GROUND ON WHICH HE TROD WAS SANCTIFIED
BUT WE PERHAPS EXAGGERATE THE GRAY OR SABLE TINGE WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY CHARACTERIZED THE MOOD AND MANNERS OF THE AGE
AGAIN A MYSTIC SISTERHOOD WOULD CONTUMACIOUSLY ASSERT ITSELF AS SHE MET THE SANCTIFIED FROWN OF SOME MATRON WHO ACCORDING TO THE RUMOUR OF ALL TONGUES HAD KEPT COLD SNOW WITHIN HER BOSOM THROUGHOUT LIFE
THUS THE NIGHT FLED AWAY AS IF IT WERE A WINGED STEED AND HE CAREERING ON IT
THE SHADOW OF HIS PRESENCE IN A FORBIDDEN PROXIMITY WOULD BE THROWN ACROSS HIS VICTIM
WITH THESE SHE DECORATED HER HAIR AND HER YOUNG WAIST AND BECAME A NYMPH CHILD OR AN INFANT DRYAD OR WHATEVER ELSE WAS IN CLOSEST SYMPATHY WITH THE ANTIQUE WOOD
THIS UNCAPTIVATING EFFECT IS PERHAPS DUE TO THE PERIOD OF HARDLY ACCOMPLISHED REVOLUTION AND STILL SEETHING TURMOIL IN WHICH THE STORY SHAPED ITSELF
BY DEGREES NOT VERY SLOWLY HER HANDIWORK BECAME WHAT WOULD NOW BE TERMED THE FASHION
DARK IT IS TRUE IF NOT GUILTY BUT OF FORCE ENOUGH TO ENGAGE THE FULL STRENGTH OF HIS FACULTIES
SO LONG AT LEAST AS THERE SHALL BE NO FURTHER SCANDAL IN THE WOMAN
NAY I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LOST IT
AMONG MANY MORALS WHICH PRESS UPON US FROM THE POOR MINISTER'S MISERABLE EXPERIENCE WE PUT ONLY THIS INTO A SENTENCE:--"BE TRUE
THE BRAVE SOLDIER HAD ALREADY NUMBERED NEARLY OR QUITE HIS THREE-SCORE YEARS AND TEN AND WAS PURSUING THE REMAINDER OF HIS EARTHLY MARCH BURDENED WITH INFIRMITIES WHICH EVEN THE MARTIAL MUSIC OF HIS OWN SPIRIT-STIRRING RECOLLECTIONS COULD DO LITTLE TOWARDS LIGHTENING
THOU AND I HESTER NEVER DID SO NEVER NEVER WHISPERED SHE
WAS I NOT THOUGH YOU MIGHT DEEM ME COLD NEVERTHELESS A MAN THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS CRAVING LITTLE FOR HIMSELF--KIND TRUE JUST AND OF CONSTANT IF NOT WARM AFFECTIONS
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTICED THAT DIRECTLY OVER THE PLATFORM ON WHICH HESTER PRYNNE STOOD WAS A KIND OF BALCONY OR OPEN GALLERY APPENDED TO THE MEETING-HOUSE
IT DECKED THE BABY'S LITTLE CAP
HIS GIFTS WERE EMPHATICALLY THOSE OF A MAN OF BUSINESS
SO ONE FINE MORNING I ASCENDED THE FLIGHT OF GRANITE STEPS WITH THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION IN MY POCKET AND WAS INTRODUCED TO THE CORPS OF GENTLEMEN WHO WERE TO AID ME IN MY WEIGHTY RESPONSIBILITY AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE
THE MARBLE FAUN
THE DIM REFLECTION OF A REMEMBERED SPLENDOUR A COLOURLESS AND MANIFOLD DILUTED REPETITION OF WHAT THEY HAD BEHELD IN PROUD OLD LONDON--WE WILL NOT SAY AT A ROYAL CORONATION BUT AT A LORD MAYOR'S SHOW--MIGHT BE TRACED IN THE CUSTOMS WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS INSTITUTED WITH REFERENCE TO THE ANNUAL INSTALLATION OF MAGISTRATES
PRAISED BE HIS NAME
BEHIND THE GOVERNOR AND MR WILSON CAME TWO OTHER GUESTS--ONE THE REVEREND ARTHUR DIMMESDALE WHOM THE READER MAY REMEMBER AS HAVING TAKEN A BRIEF AND RELUCTANT PART IN THE SCENE OF HESTER PRYNNE'S DISGRACE
MOST PERSONS OWING TO CAUSES WHICH I MAY NOT HAVE SPACE TO HINT AT SUFFER MORAL DETRIMENT FROM THIS PECULIAR MODE OF LIFE
HIS EYES HOWEVER WERE SOON GREETED BY A LITTLE GLIMMERING LIGHT WHICH AT FIRST A LONG WAY OFF WAS APPROACHING UP THE STREET
THERE WERE A FEW ROSE-BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE-TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MR BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA
THE READER MAY CHOOSE AMONG THESE THEORIES
THE ELVISH CHILD THEN LAUGHED ALOUD
THE CHILD AT THE BROOK-SIDE CHAPTER XX
YOU HAVE BARTERED IT FOR A PITTANCE OF THE PUBLIC GOLD
IT IS THE MINISTER AND SO IT IS SAID THE CHILD
SHE SEEMED THE UNPREMEDITATED OFFSHOOT OF A PASSIONATE MOMENT
THE RUST ON THE PONDEROUS IRON-WORK OF ITS OAKEN DOOR LOOKED MORE ANTIQUE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE NEW WORLD
THOU WAST NOT BOLD!--THOU WAST NOT TRUE ANSWERED THE CHILD
LIFE HAD NEVER BROUGHT THEM A GLOOMIER HOUR
OR AS IS MORE THY NATURE BE A SCHOLAR AND A SAGE AMONG THE WISEST AND THE MOST RENOWNED OF THE CULTIVATED WORLD
METHOUGHT THE GERM OF IT WAS DEAD IN ME
COME AWAY OR YONDER OLD BLACK MAN WILL CATCH YOU
IT THREW A GLEAM OF RECOGNITION ON HERE A POST AND THERE A GARDEN FENCE AND HERE A LATTICED WINDOW-PANE AND THERE A PUMP WITH ITS FULL TROUGH OF WATER AND HERE AGAIN AN ARCHED DOOR OF OAK WITH AN IRON KNOCKER AND A ROUGH LOG FOR THE DOOR-STEP
IT WAS NOT MERELY DURING THE THREE HOURS AND A HALF WHICH UNCLE SAM CLAIMED AS HIS SHARE OF MY DAILY LIFE THAT THIS WRETCHED NUMBNESS HELD POSSESSION OF ME
FOR THOUGH THE TRACES OF ADVANCING LIFE WERE VISIBLE HE BORE HIS AGE WELL AND SEEMED TO RETAIN A WIRY VIGOUR AND ALERTNESS
THAT DARES THRUST HIMSELF BETWEEN THE SUFFERER AND HIS GOD WITH A FRANTIC GESTURE HE RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM
HOW HE HAUNTS THIS FOREST AND CARRIES A BOOK WITH HIM A BIG HEAVY BOOK WITH IRON CLASPS
TOGETHER WITH A RANGE AND FREEDOM OF IDEAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE VAINLY LOOKED FOR AMONG THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PROFESSION
THESE PEARL GATHERED AND WAS PLEASED WITH THEIR WILD FLAVOUR
HAD A ROAR OF LAUGHTER BURST FROM THE MULTITUDE--EACH MAN EACH WOMAN EACH LITTLE SHRILL-VOICED CHILD CONTRIBUTING THEIR INDIVIDUAL PARTS--HESTER PRYNNE MIGHT HAVE REPAID THEM ALL WITH A BITTER AND DISDAINFUL SMILE
YOUTHFUL MEN NOT HAVING TAKEN A DEEP ROOT GIVE UP THEIR HOLD OF LIFE SO EASILY
BEFORE THE MINISTER HAD TIME TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY OVER THIS LAST TEMPTATION HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER IMPULSE MORE LUDICROUS AND ALMOST AS HORRIBLE
A CLUMP OF SCRUBBY TREES SUCH AS ALONE GREW ON THE PENINSULA DID NOT SO MUCH CONCEAL THE COTTAGE FROM VIEW AS SEEM TO DENOTE THAT HERE WAS SOME OBJECT WHICH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST OUGHT TO BE CONCEALED
HIS GESTURES HIS GAIT HIS GRIZZLED BEARD HIS SLIGHTEST AND MOST INDIFFERENT ACTS THE VERY FASHION OF HIS GARMENTS WERE ODIOUS IN THE CLERGYMAN'S SIGHT
THE GOVERNOR'S HALL CHAPTER VIII
BUT SHE--THE NAUGHTY BAGGAGE--LITTLE WILL SHE CARE WHAT THEY PUT UPON THE BODICE OF HER GOWN
SO DEEP A STAIN INDEED THAT HIS DRY OLD BONES IN THE CHARTER-STREET BURIAL-GROUND MUST STILL RETAIN IT IF THEY HAVE NOT CRUMBLED UTTERLY TO DUST
AS HE DREW NEAR THE TOWN HE TOOK AN IMPRESSION OF CHANGE FROM THE SERIES OF FAMILIAR OBJECTS THAT PRESENTED THEMSELVES
BUT ONLY UNDER THE FALLEN LEAVES REPLIED THE MINISTER WITH A SAD SMILE
AND MOTHER HE HAS HIS HAND OVER HIS HEART
HE WAS A RULER IN THE CHURCH
IT WILL BE SEEN LIKEWISE THAT THIS CUSTOM-HOUSE SKETCH HAS A CERTAIN PROPRIETY OF A KIND ALWAYS RECOGNISED IN LITERATURE AS EXPLAINING HOW A LARGE PORTION OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND AS OFFERING PROOFS OF THE AUTHENTICITY OF A NARRATIVE THEREIN CONTAINED
IT HAS BEEN RELATED HOW IN THE CROWD THAT WITNESSED HESTER PRYNNE'S IGNOMINIOUS EXPOSURE STOOD A MAN ELDERLY TRAVEL-WORN WHO JUST EMERGING FROM THE PERILOUS WILDERNESS BEHELD THE WOMAN IN WHOM HE HOPED TO FIND EMBODIED THE WARMTH AND CHEERFULNESS OF HOME SET UP AS A TYPE OF SIN BEFORE THE PEOPLE
IF HE SHOW NO INTRUSIVE EGOTISM NOR DISAGREEABLE PROMINENT CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS OWN
THERE WAS A STEEL HEAD-PIECE A CUIRASS A GORGET AND GREAVES WITH A PAIR OF GAUNTLETS AND A SWORD HANGING BENEATH
THUS THE MINISTER FELT NO APPREHENSION THAT ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WOULD TOUCH IN EXPRESS WORDS UPON THE REAL POSITION WHICH THEY SUSTAINED TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER
THE REMAINDER MAY PERHAPS BE APPLIED TO PURPOSES EQUALLY VALUABLE HEREAFTER OR NOT IMPOSSIBLY MAY BE WORKED UP SO FAR AS THEY GO INTO A REGULAR HISTORY OF SALEM SHOULD MY VENERATION FOR THE NATAL SOIL EVER IMPEL ME TO SO PIOUS A TASK
SHE LAUGHED AND WENT CAPERING DOWN THE HALL SO AIRILY THAT OLD MR WILSON RAISED A QUESTION WHETHER EVEN HER TIPTOES TOUCHED THE FLOOR
THERE IS A SYMPATHY THAT WILL MAKE ME CONSCIOUS OF HIM
WAS EXISTENCE WORTH ACCEPTING EVEN TO THE HAPPIEST AMONG THEM
YEA INDEED HE DID NOT ERR THERE WAS A FIEND AT HIS ELBOW
FOR SUCH WAS PEARL'S WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE THAT HER MOTHER HALF DOUBTED WHETHER SHE WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE SECRET SPELL OF HER EXISTENCE AND MIGHT NOT NOW REVEAL HERSELF
I WONDER IF MOTHER WILL ASK ME WHAT IT MEANS THOUGHT PEARL
AFTER LIVING FOR THREE YEARS WITHIN THE SUBTLE INFLUENCE OF AN INTELLECT LIKE EMERSON'S
ALAS
ALAS
BUT AS HE PROCEEDED A TERRIBLE FASCINATION A KIND OF FIERCE THOUGH STILL CALM NECESSITY SEIZED THE OLD MAN WITHIN ITS GRIPE AND NEVER SET HIM FREE AGAIN UNTIL HE HAD DONE ALL ITS BIDDING
NAY
IT WAS NEAR THAT OLD AND SUNKEN GRAVE YET WITH A SPACE BETWEEN AS IF THE DUST OF THE TWO SLEEPERS HAD NO RIGHT TO MINGLE
WITH THE SCARLET TOKEN OF INFAMY ON HER BREAST
BRING IT HITHER SAID HESTER
BREATHE NOT TO ANY HUMAN SOUL THAT THOU DIDST EVER CALL ME HUSBAND
MAKE THAT PLAIN I PRAY YOU IT MUST BE EVEN SO RESUMED THE MINISTER
IT WOULD NOT REFLECT OR ONLY WITH MISERABLE DIMNESS THE FIGURES WITH WHICH I DID MY BEST TO PEOPLE IT
THE GREAT VAULT BRIGHTENED LIKE THE DOME OF AN IMMENSE LAMP
BUT NOW PEARL I HEAR A FOOTSTEP ALONG THE PATH AND THE NOISE OF ONE PUTTING ASIDE THE BRANCHES
AS IT WAS THE ESSENCE OF THIS PUNISHMENT TO DO
IT SEEMED NOT YESTERDAY NOT ONE NOT TWO BUT MANY DAYS OR EVEN YEARS AGO SINCE HE HAD QUITTED THEM
THEY FEAR TO TAKE UP THE SHAME THAT RIGHTFULLY BELONGS TO THEM
TOO LITTLE RELIEVED BY THE TENDER AND FAMILIAR INFLUENCES WHICH SOFTEN ALMOST EVERY SCENE OF NATURE AND REAL LIFE AND UNDOUBTEDLY SHOULD SOFTEN EVERY PICTURE OF THEM
FOR ELSEWHERE A WANDERER AND ISOLATED FROM HUMAN INTERESTS I FIND HERE A WOMAN A MAN A CHILD AMONGST WHOM AND MYSELF THERE EXIST THE CLOSEST LIGAMENTS
THERE WAS A FASCINATION FOR THE MINISTER IN THE COMPANY OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE IN WHOM HE RECOGNISED AN INTELLECTUAL CULTIVATION OF NO MODERATE DEPTH OR SCOPE
M
IT WAS A LAW OF NATURE WITH HIM RATHER THAN A CHOICE OR A PRINCIPLE
WITH THESE REMORSEFUL FEELINGS HE LOST NO TIME IN MAKING THE AMPLEST APOLOGIES AND BESOUGHT HIS FRIEND STILL TO CONTINUE THE CARE WHICH IF NOT SUCCESSFUL IN RESTORING HIM TO HEALTH HAD IN ALL PROBABILITY BEEN THE MEANS OF PROLONGING HIS FEEBLE EXISTENCE TO THAT HOUR
HE LOSES IN AN EXTENT PROPORTIONED TO THE WEAKNESS OR FORCE OF HIS ORIGINAL NATURE THE CAPABILITY OF SELF-SUPPORT
THUS HESTER PRYNNE WHOSE HEART HAD LOST ITS REGULAR AND HEALTHY THROB WANDERED WITHOUT A CLUE IN THE DARK LABYRINTH OF MIND
TRUE
THE CHAIRS WITH EACH ITS SEPARATE INDIVIDUALITY
IT MATTERED LITTLE FOR HIS OBJECT WHETHER CELESTIAL OR FROM WHAT OTHER REGION
STAND ANY HERE THAT QUESTION GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A SINNER
THERE ARE SUCH MEN ANSWERED MR DIMMESDALE
HAD I ONE FRIEND--OR WERE IT MY WORST ENEMY!--TO WHOM WHEN SICKENED WITH THE PRAISES OF ALL OTHER MEN I COULD DAILY BETAKE MYSELF AND BE KNOWN AS THE VILEST OF ALL SINNERS METHINKS MY SOUL MIGHT KEEP ITSELF ALIVE THEREBY
IT WAS FOUND SAID THE SEXTON THIS MORNING ON THE SCAFFOLD WHERE EVIL-DOERS ARE SET UP TO PUBLIC SHAME
LITTLE PEARL MEANWHILE HAD QUITTED HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND WAS PLAYING AT HER OWN WILL ABOUT THE MARKET-PLACE
IN OTHER WORDS MR DIMMESDALE WHOSE SENSIBILITY OF NERVE OFTEN PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF SPIRITUAL INTUITION WOULD BECOME VAGUELY AWARE THAT SOMETHING INIMICAL TO HIS PEACE HAD THRUST ITSELF INTO RELATION WITH HIM
A WOLF IT IS SAID--BUT HERE THE TALE HAS SURELY LAPSED INTO THE IMPROBABLE--CAME UP AND SMELT OF PEARL'S ROBE AND OFFERED HIS SAVAGE HEAD TO BE PATTED BY HER HAND
AND GOD IS MERCIFUL
THE MOANS OF THE LITTLE PATIENT SUBSIDED
WHOM WOULD THEY DISCERN THERE WITH THE RED EASTERN LIGHT UPON HIS BROW
THE SAINT ON EARTH
IT IS EVEN NOW AT MY LIPS DRINK THEN REPLIED HE STILL WITH THE SAME COLD COMPOSURE
LIFTING HER RELUCTANT EYES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING HUMAN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF VIEW SAVE THE FORM OF THIS EARTHLY SAINT
WHETHER FROM COMMISERATION FOR A WOMAN OF SO MISERABLE A DESTINY
THE GODLY YOUTH SAID THEY AMONG THEMSELVES
I THINK TO NEED NO MORE OF YOUR DRUGS MY KIND PHYSICIAN GOOD THOUGH THEY BE AND ADMINISTERED BY A FRIENDLY HAND ALL THIS TIME ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WAS LOOKING AT THE MINISTER WITH THE GRAVE AND INTENT REGARD OF A PHYSICIAN TOWARDS HIS PATIENT
IN THE BROOK AGAIN WAS THE FANTASTIC BEAUTY OF THE IMAGE WITH ITS REFLECTED FROWN ITS POINTED FINGER AND IMPERIOUS GESTURE GIVING EMPHASIS TO THE ASPECT OF LITTLE PEARL
THE MOMENT WHEN A MAN'S HEAD DROPS OFF IS SELDOM OR NEVER I AM INCLINED TO THINK PRECISELY THE MOST AGREEABLE OF HIS LIFE
HERE THERE WAS THE TAINT OF DEEPEST SIN IN THE MOST SACRED QUALITY OF HUMAN LIFE WORKING SUCH EFFECT THAT THE WORLD WAS ONLY THE DARKER FOR THIS WOMAN'S BEAUTY AND THE MORE LOST FOR THE INFANT THAT SHE HAD BORNE
NOW TURNED ASIDE BY AN INSURMOUNTABLE PRECIPICE
IF SUCH REVELATIONS BE RECEIVED WITHOUT TUMULT AND ACKNOWLEDGED NOT SO OFTEN BY AN UTTERED SYMPATHY AS BY SILENCE AN INARTICULATE BREATH AND HERE AND THERE A WORD TO INDICATE THAT ALL IS UNDERSTOOD
BUT I HAVE LEARNED MANY NEW SECRETS IN THE WILDERNESS AND HERE IS ONE OF THEM--A RECIPE THAT AN INDIAN TAUGHT ME IN REQUITAL OF SOME LESSONS OF MY OWN THAT WERE AS OLD AS PARACELSUS
THE CLERGYMAN THEREFORE HEARING NO SYMPTOMS OF DISTURBANCE UNCOVERED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
ALL AT ONCE AS WITH A SUDDEN SMILE OF HEAVEN FORTH BURST THE SUNSHINE POURING A VERY FLOOD INTO THE OBSCURE FOREST GLADDENING EACH GREEN LEAF TRANSMUTING THE YELLOW FALLEN ONES TO GOLD AND GLEAMING ADOWN THE GRAY TRUNKS OF THE SOLEMN TREES
THE LEECH AND HIS PATIENT OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH THROUGHOUT LIFE HAD BEEN CALM IN TEMPERAMENT KINDLY THOUGH NOT OF WARM AFFECTIONS BUT EVER AND IN ALL HIS RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD A PURE AND UPRIGHT MAN
SO LEARNED A MAN AS YOU SPEAK OF SHOULD HAVE LEARNED THIS TOO IN HIS BOOKS
NOW I WILL ANSWERED THE CHILD BOUNDING ACROSS THE BROOK AND CLASPING HESTER IN HER ARMS NOW THOU ART MY MOTHER INDEED
PEARL EITHER SAW AND RESPONDED TO HER MOTHER'S FEELINGS OR HERSELF FELT THE REMOTENESS AND INTANGIBILITY THAT HAD FALLEN AROUND THE MINISTER
OR TAKING SCALPS IN A SHAM FIGHT WITH THE INDIANS OR SCARING ONE ANOTHER WITH FREAKS OF IMITATIVE WITCHCRAFT
HIS HEARERS COULD NOT REST UNTIL THEY HAD TOLD ONE ANOTHER OF WHAT EACH KNEW BETTER THAN HE COULD TELL OR HEAR
WILT THOU STAND HERE WITH MOTHER AND ME TO-MORROW NOONTIDE INQUIRED PEARL
WE SAID SO TO EACH OTHER
IT IS NO INDICATION HOWEVER OF A LACK OF CHEERFULNESS IN THE WRITER'S MIND
MANY MANY A POOR SOUL HATH GIVEN ITS CONFIDENCE TO ME NOT ONLY ON THE DEATH-BED BUT WHILE STRONG IN LIFE AND FAIR IN REPUTATION
HE STOOD AT THIS MOMENT ON THE VERY PROUDEST EMINENCE OF SUPERIORITY TO WHICH THE GIFTS OR INTELLECT RICH LORE PREVAILING ELOQUENCE AND A REPUTATION OF WHITEST SANCTITY COULD EXALT A CLERGYMAN IN NEW ENGLAND'S EARLIEST DAYS WHEN THE PROFESSIONAL CHARACTER WAS OF ITSELF A LOFTY PEDESTAL
BUT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF HESTER'S LIFE THERE WERE INDICATIONS THAT THE RECLUSE OF THE SCARLET LETTER WAS THE OBJECT OF LOVE AND INTEREST WITH SOME INHABITANT OF ANOTHER LAND
THE OLD CLERGYMAN NURTURED AT THE RICH BOSOM OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH HAD A LONG ESTABLISHED AND LEGITIMATE TASTE FOR ALL GOOD AND COMFORTABLE THINGS AND HOWEVER STERN HE MIGHT SHOW HIMSELF IN THE PULPIT OR IN HIS PUBLIC REPROOF OF SUCH TRANSGRESSIONS AS THAT OF HESTER PRYNNE STILL THE GENIAL BENEVOLENCE OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE HAD WON HIM WARMER AFFECTION THAN WAS ACCORDED TO ANY OF HIS PROFESSIONAL CONTEMPORARIES
AND SHE WAS GENTLER HERE THAN IN THE GRASSY-MARGINED STREETS OF THE SETTLEMENT OR IN HER MOTHER'S COTTAGE
IT BEHOVES YOU
THEY LOOKED NEITHER OLDER NOR YOUNGER NOW
IT RUNS AWAY AND HIDES ITSELF BECAUSE IT IS AFRAID OF SOMETHING ON YOUR BOSOM
HIS NAME WAS ANNOUNCED AS ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
IN PEARL'S YOUNG BEAUTY AS IN THE WRINKLED WITCH IT HAS A PRETERNATURAL EFFECT
THE WHOLE PECULIARITY IN SHORT OF HER POSITION IN RESPECT TO OTHER CHILDREN
TO SUM UP THE MATTER IT GREW TO BE A WIDELY DIFFUSED OPINION THAT THE REV
FOR BELIEVE ME HESTER THOUGH HE WERE TO STEP DOWN FROM A HIGH PLACE AND STAND THERE BESIDE THEE ON THY PEDESTAL OF SHAME YET BETTER WERE IT SO THAN TO HIDE A GUILTY HEART THROUGH LIFE
AS WITNESS THE QUAKERS WHO HAVE REMEMBERED HIM IN THEIR HISTORIES AND RELATE AN INCIDENT OF HIS HARD SEVERITY TOWARDS A WOMAN OF THEIR SECT WHICH WILL LAST LONGER IT IS TO BE FEARED THAN ANY RECORD OF HIS BETTER DEEDS ALTHOUGH THESE WERE MANY
IT SOON PROVED ITS EFFICACY AND REDEEMED THE LEECH'S PLEDGE
TRUE STORIES FROM HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY THE WHOLE HISTORY OF GRANDFATHER'S CHAIR 1851 A WONDER BOOK FOR GIRLS AND BOYS 1851
GOODWIVES SAID A HARD-FEATURED DAME OF FIFTY I'LL TELL YE A PIECE OF MY MIND
WHO IS HE ASK ME NOT REPLIED HESTER PRYNNE LOOKING FIRMLY INTO HIS FACE
THOU STRANGE CHILD
AND THUS MUCH OF WOMAN WAS THERE IN HESTER THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY FORGIVE HIM--LEAST OF ALL NOW WHEN THE HEAVY FOOTSTEP OF THEIR APPROACHING FATE MIGHT BE HEARD NEARER NEARER NEARER!--FOR BEING ABLE SO COMPLETELY TO WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM THEIR MUTUAL WORLD--WHILE SHE GROPED DARKLY AND STRETCHED FORTH HER COLD HANDS AND FOUND HIM NOT
LUTHER ACCORDING TO THE SCANDAL OF HIS MONKISH ENEMIES WAS A BRAT OF THAT HELLISH BREED
SOME DECLARED THAT IF MR DIMMESDALE WERE REALLY GOING TO DIE IT WAS CAUSE ENOUGH THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT WORTHY TO BE ANY LONGER TRODDEN BY HIS FEET
AND WHY DOST THOU WEAR IT
LETTING THE EYES FOLLOW ALONG THE COURSE OF THE STREAM THEY COULD CATCH THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM ITS WATER AT SOME SHORT DISTANCE WITHIN THE FOREST BUT SOON LOST ALL TRACES OF IT AMID THE BEWILDERMENT OF TREE-TRUNKS AND UNDERBRUSH AND HERE AND THERE A HUGE ROCK COVERED OVER WITH GRAY LICHENS
THE ANGEL AND APOSTLE OF THE COMING REVELATION MUST BE A WOMAN INDEED BUT LOFTY PURE AND BEAUTIFUL AND WISE
WITHOUT DISPUTING A TRUTH SO MOMENTOUS WE MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THIS VERSION OF MR DIMMESDALE'S STORY AS ONLY AN INSTANCE OF THAT STUBBORN FIDELITY WITH WHICH A MAN'S FRIENDS--AND ESPECIALLY A CLERGYMAN'S--WILL SOMETIMES UPHOLD HIS CHARACTER WHEN PROOFS CLEAR AS THE MID-DAY SUNSHINE ON THE SCARLET LETTER ESTABLISH HIM A FALSE AND SIN-STAINED CREATURE OF THE DUST
THIS FIGURE OF THE STUDY AND THE CLOISTER AS HESTER PRYNNE'S WOMANLY FANCY FAILED NOT TO RECALL WAS SLIGHTLY DEFORMED WITH THE LEFT SHOULDER A TRIFLE HIGHER THAN THE RIGHT
AGAIN A THIRD INSTANCE
THE FOREST CANNOT HIDE IT
SO FORCIBLY DID HE DWELL UPON THIS SYMBOL FOR THE HOUR OR MORE DURING WHICH HIS PERIODS WERE ROLLING OVER THE PEOPLE'S HEADS THAT IT ASSUMED NEW TERRORS IN THEIR IMAGINATION AND SEEMED TO DERIVE ITS SCARLET HUE FROM THE FLAMES OF THE INFERNAL PIT
WHICH AT SOME EPOCH OF THE PRECEDING CENTURY HAD BEEN A GIGANTIC PINE WITH ITS ROOTS AND TRUNK IN THE DARKSOME SHADE AND ITS HEAD ALOFT IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE
SEE THERE IS THE BLACKSMITH
AND THE INFECTIOUS POISON OF THAT SIN HAD BEEN THUS RAPIDLY DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT HIS MORAL SYSTEM
EXCHANGE THIS FALSE LIFE OF THINE FOR A TRUE ONE
HE MADE A STEP NIGHER AND DISCOVERED THE SCARLET LETTER
THE MINISTER HERE MADE A PAUSE
TRUSTING NO MAN AS HIS FRIEND HE COULD NOT RECOGNIZE HIS ENEMY WHEN THE LATTER ACTUALLY APPEARED
IT HAD BEEN DETERMINED BETWEEN THEM THAT THE OLD WORLD WITH ITS CROWDS AND CITIES OFFERED THEM A MORE ELIGIBLE SHELTER AND CONCEALMENT THAN THE WILDS OF NEW ENGLAND OR ALL AMERICA WITH ITS ALTERNATIVES OF AN INDIAN WIGWAM OR THE FEW SETTLEMENTS OF EUROPEANS SCATTERED THINLY ALONG THE SEA-BOARD
THOU MUST KNOW PEARL SAID SHE
PRITHEE YOUNG ONE WHO ART THOU AND WHAT HAS AILED THY MOTHER TO BEDIZEN THEE IN THIS STRANGE FASHION
A RAY OF HUMOUR NOW AND THEN WOULD MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THE VEIL OF DIM OBSTRUCTION AND GLIMMER PLEASANTLY UPON OUR FACES
AND THEN HE SETS HIS MARK ON THEIR BOSOMS
HOW SOON--WITH WHAT STRANGE RAPIDITY INDEED DID PEARL ARRIVE AT AN AGE THAT WAS CAPABLE OF SOCIAL INTERCOURSE BEYOND THE MOTHER'S EVER-READY SMILE AND NONSENSE-WORDS
THE SENSITIVE CLERGYMAN SHRANK WITH NERVOUS DREAD FROM THE LIGHT MISSILE
IT WAS HARDLY A MAN WITH LIFE IN HIM THAT TOTTERED ON HIS PATH SO NERVOUSLY YET TOTTERED AND DID NOT FALL
I HAVE EVEN BEEN AFRAID OF LITTLE PEARL AH THAT WAS SAD ANSWERED THE MOTHER
HE COULD PLAY UPON HIM AS HE CHOSE
GOD KNOWS
FOR IN GOOD SOOTH I HARDLY THINK TO TARRY WITH MY FLOCK THROUGH THE FLITTING SEASONS OF ANOTHER YEAR
II
FIRST AS THE BABE IN ARMS AND AFTERWARDS AS THE LITTLE GIRL SMALL COMPANION OF HER MOTHER HOLDING A FOREFINGER WITH HER WHOLE GRASP AND TRIPPING ALONG AT THE RATE OF THREE OR FOUR FOOTSTEPS TO ONE OF HESTER'S
OR--CAN WE NOT SUPPOSE IT?--GUILTY AS THEY MAY BE RETAINING NEVERTHELESS A ZEAL FOR GOD'S GLORY AND MAN'S WELFARE THEY SHRINK FROM DISPLAYING THEMSELVES BLACK AND FILTHY IN THE VIEW OF MEN
CONTINUALLY INDEED AS IT STOLE ONWARD THE STREAMLET KEPT UP A BABBLE KIND QUIET SOOTHING BUT MELANCHOLY LIKE THE VOICE OF A YOUNG CHILD THAT WAS SPENDING ITS INFANCY WITHOUT PLAYFULNESS AND KNEW NOT HOW TO BE MERRY AMONG SAD ACQUAINTANCE AND EVENTS OF SOMBRE HUE
AN INDIAN IN HIS NATIVE GARB WAS STANDING THERE
PUBLIC CEREMONIES SUCH AS ORDINATIONS THE INSTALLATION OF MAGISTRATES AND ALL THAT COULD GIVE MAJESTY TO THE FORMS IN WHICH A NEW GOVERNMENT MANIFESTED ITSELF TO THE PEOPLE WERE AS A MATTER OF POLICY MARKED BY A STATELY AND WELL-CONDUCTED CEREMONIAL AND A SOMBRE BUT YET A STUDIED MAGNIFICENCE
IT WAS PLEASANT IN THE SUMMER FORENOONS--WHEN THE FERVENT HEAT THAT ALMOST LIQUEFIED THE REST OF THE HUMAN FAMILY MERELY COMMUNICATED A GENIAL WARMTH TO THEIR HALF TORPID SYSTEMS--IT WAS PLEASANT TO HEAR THEM CHATTING IN THE BACK ENTRY A ROW OF THEM ALL TIPPED AGAINST THE WALL AS USUAL
AND EARLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HAD CHOSEN FOR HIS SPIRITUAL GUIDE THE REVEREND MR DIMMESDALE
IN A WORD OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WAS A STRIKING EVIDENCE OF MAN'S FACULTY OF TRANSFORMING HIMSELF INTO A DEVIL IF HE WILL ONLY FOR A REASONABLE SPACE OF TIME UNDERTAKE A DEVIL'S OFFICE
AND HE IS MERCIFUL
ARTHUR DIMMESDALE LIKE MANY OTHER PERSONAGES OF SPECIAL SANCTITY IN ALL AGES OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD WAS HAUNTED EITHER BY SATAN HIMSELF OR SATAN'S EMISSARY IN THE GUISE OF OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
I SHALL DO BETTER AMONGST OTHER FACES
THERE IS NO PATH TO GUIDE US OUT OF THIS DISMAL MAZE WOMAN I COULD WELL-NIGH PITY THEE SAID ROGER CHILLINGWORTH UNABLE TO RESTRAIN A THRILL OF ADMIRATION TOO FOR THERE WAS A QUALITY ALMOST MAJESTIC IN THE DESPAIR WHICH SHE EXPRESSED
AT OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH'S DECEASE WHICH TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE YEAR AND BY HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF WHICH GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM AND THE REVEREND MR WILSON WERE EXECUTORS HE BEQUEATHED A VERY CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY BOTH HERE AND IN ENGLAND TO LITTLE PEARL THE DAUGHTER OF HESTER PRYNNE
WHEN NO LONGER CALLED UPON TO SPEAK OR LISTEN--EITHER OF WHICH OPERATIONS COST HIM AN EVIDENT EFFORT--HIS FACE WOULD BRIEFLY SUBSIDE INTO ITS FORMER NOT UNCHEERFUL QUIETUDE
HER ONE BABY-VOICE SERVED A MULTITUDE OF IMAGINARY PERSONAGES OLD AND YOUNG TO TALK WITHAL
AND SAINTLY MEN WHO WALK WITH GOD ON EARTH WOULD FAIN BE AWAY TO WALK WITH HIM ON THE GOLDEN PAVEMENTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM NAY REJOINED THE YOUNG MINISTER PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS HEART WITH A FLUSH OF PAIN FLITTING OVER HIS BROW WERE I WORTHIER TO WALK THERE I COULD BE BETTER CONTENT TO TOIL HERE GOOD MEN EVER INTERPRET THEMSELVES TOO MEANLY SAID THE PHYSICIAN
BUT SHE IS MOSTLY THINE NO NO
BUT ARTHUR DIMMESDALE
A BETTER BOOK THAN I SHALL EVER WRITE WAS THERE
EVERY GESTURE EVERY WORD AND EVEN THE SILENCE OF THOSE WITH WHOM SHE CAME IN CONTACT IMPLIED AND OFTEN EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS BANISHED AND AS MUCH ALONE AS IF SHE INHABITED ANOTHER SPHERE OR COMMUNICATED WITH THE COMMON NATURE BY OTHER ORGANS AND SENSES THAN THE REST OF HUMAN KIND
NOT THE LESS HOWEVER THOUGH WITH A TREMULOUS ENJOYMENT DID HE FEEL THE OCCASIONAL RELIEF OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF ANOTHER KIND OF INTELLECT THAN THOSE WITH WHICH HE HABITUALLY HELD CONVERSE
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS AS IS THE CUSTOM OF YOUNG CHILDREN AFTER RELIEF FROM PAIN IT SANK INTO A PROFOUND AND DEWY SLUMBER
SO MAGNIFICENT WAS THE SMALL FIGURE WHEN THUS ARRAYED AND SUCH WAS THE SPLENDOUR OF PEARL'S OWN PROPER BEAUTY SHINING THROUGH THE GORGEOUS ROBES WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXTINGUISHED A PALER LOVELINESS THAT THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE CIRCLE OF RADIANCE AROUND HER ON THE DARKSOME COTTAGE FLOOR
WHERE ARE YOU PEARL WHOSE ACTIVITY OF SPIRIT NEVER FLAGGED HAD BEEN AT NO LOSS FOR AMUSEMENT WHILE HER MOTHER TALKED WITH THE OLD GATHERER OF HERBS
I KNOW NOT LETHE NOR NEPENTHE REMARKED HE
THE SNOW IMAGE AND OTHER TALES 1851
HESTER LOOKED AT HIM WITH A THRILL OF ANOTHER JOY
THE TRUTH SEEMS TO BE HOWEVER THAT THE MOTHER-FOREST AND THESE WILD THINGS WHICH IT NOURISHED ALL RECOGNISED A KINDRED WILDERNESS IN THE HUMAN CHILD
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FAMILY IN THOSE DAYS WAS OF A FAR MORE RIGID KIND THAN NOW
WITHIN THE CHURCH IT HAD HARDLY BEEN KEPT DOWN
THE CHILDREN HAVE COME FROM THEIR SCHOOLS AND THE GROWN PEOPLE FROM THEIR WORKSHOPS AND THEIR FIELDS ON PURPOSE TO BE HAPPY FOR TO-DAY A NEW MAN IS BEGINNING TO RULE OVER THEM
SO FAR AS A DEMEANOUR OF NATURAL AUTHORITY WAS CONCERNED THE MOTHER COUNTRY NEED NOT HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO SEE THESE FOREMOST MEN OF AN ACTUAL DEMOCRACY ADOPTED INTO THE HOUSE OF PEERS OR MAKE THE PRIVY COUNCIL OF THE SOVEREIGN
ON ONE OF THOSE UGLY NIGHTS WHICH WE HAVE FAINTLY HINTED AT BUT FORBORNE TO PICTURE FORTH THE MINISTER STARTED FROM HIS CHAIR
CARE MUST BE HAD NEVERTHELESS TO PUT THE CHILD TO DUE AND STATED EXAMINATION IN THE CATECHISM AT THY HANDS OR MASTER DIMMESDALE'S
AND TO SAY THE TRUTH AN APPETITE SHARPENED BY THE EAST WIND THAT GENERALLY BLEW ALONG THE PASSAGE WAS THE ONLY VALUABLE RESULT OF SO MUCH INDEFATIGABLE EXERCISE
BUT THE AIR WAS TOO FRESH AND CHILL TO BE LONG BREATHED WITH COMFORT
HAD HESTER SINNED ALONE HER IMAGINATION WAS SOMEWHAT AFFECTED AND HAD SHE BEEN OF A SOFTER MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL FIBRE WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE SO BY THE STRANGE AND SOLITARY ANGUISH OF HER LIFE
YONDER SHE IS STANDING IN A STREAK OF SUNSHINE A GOOD WAY OFF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BROOK
SOMETIMES A LIGHT GLIMMERED OUT OF THE PHYSICIAN'S EYES BURNING BLUE AND OMINOUS LIKE THE REFLECTION OF A FURNACE OR LET US SAY LIKE ONE OF THOSE GLEAMS OF GHASTLY FIRE THAT DARTED FROM BUNYAN'S AWFUL DOORWAY IN THE HILLSIDE AND QUIVERED ON THE PILGRIM'S FACE
YET UTTERING HIS LONG-RESTRAINED EMOTIONS SO VEHEMENTLY AS HE DID HIS WORDS HERE OFFERED HER THE VERY POINT OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH TO INTERPOSE WHAT SHE CAME TO SAY
HEARKEN UNTO ME HESTER PRYNNE SAID THE VOICE
ALL THE WORLD HAD FROWNED ON HER--FOR SEVEN LONG YEARS HAD IT FROWNED UPON THIS LONELY WOMAN--AND STILL SHE BORE IT ALL NOR EVER ONCE TURNED AWAY HER FIRM SAD EYES
BUT ALL THIS WHILE I WAS GIVING MYSELF VERY UNNECESSARY ALARM
IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH IN KEEPING WITH THE SCENE TO EXCITE SURPRISE WERE WE TO LOOK ABOUT US AND DISCOVER A FORM BELOVED BUT GONE HENCE NOW SITTING QUIETLY IN A STREAK OF THIS MAGIC MOONSHINE WITH AN ASPECT THAT WOULD MAKE US DOUBT WHETHER IT HAD RETURNED FROM AFAR OR HAD NEVER ONCE STIRRED FROM OUR FIRESIDE
NEITHER THE FRONT NOR THE BACK ENTRANCE OF THE CUSTOM-HOUSE OPENS ON THE ROAD TO PARADISE
THE SAME TORPOR AS REGARDED THE CAPACITY FOR INTELLECTUAL EFFORT ACCOMPANIED ME HOME AND WEIGHED UPON ME IN THE CHAMBER WHICH I MOST ABSURDLY TERMED MY STUDY
SHE DEEMED IT HER CRIME MOST TO BE REPENTED OF THAT SHE HAD EVER ENDURED AND RECIPROCATED THE LUKEWARM GRASP OF HIS HAND AND HAD SUFFERED THE SMILE OF HER LIPS AND EYES TO MINGLE AND MELT INTO HIS OWN
AND DIDST THOU EVER MEET HIM
WHO IS HE
WHO IS HE
IN 12 VOLUMES WITH INTRODUCTORY NOTES BY LATHROP RIVERSIDE EDITION 1883
THE PURITANS LOOKED ON AND IF THEY SMILED WERE NONE THE LESS INCLINED TO PRONOUNCE THE CHILD A DEMON OFFSPRING FROM THE INDESCRIBABLE CHARM OF BEAUTY AND ECCENTRICITY THAT SHONE THROUGH HER LITTLE FIGURE AND SPARKLED WITH ITS ACTIVITY
DOST THOU REMEMBER ME HESTER AS I WAS NINE YEARS AGONE
NONE
IT MAY APPEAR SINGULAR AND INDEED NOT A LITTLE LUDICROUS THAT AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND WHICH IN LATER DAYS WOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO NO HIGHER JURISDICTION THAN THAT OF THE SELECT MEN OF THE TOWN SHOULD THEN HAVE BEEN A QUESTION PUBLICLY DISCUSSED AND ON WHICH STATESMEN OF EMINENCE TOOK SIDES
THAT SELF WAS GONE
IT IS SADLY CURIOUS TO OBSERVE HOW SLIGHT A TASTE OF OFFICE SUFFICES TO INFECT A POOR FELLOW WITH THIS SINGULAR DISEASE
MINGLING VARIOUS WALKS WITH THE SPLASH AND MURMUR OF THE WAVES AND THE SOLEMN WIND-ANTHEM AMONG THE TREE-TOPS
THERE SEEMED TO BE HERE THE GROUNDWORK OF A TALE
BUT FOR MY AID HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE BURNED AWAY IN TORMENTS WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER THE PERPETRATION OF HIS CRIME AND THINE
OFTENTIMES THEY WERE ASLEEP BUT OCCASIONALLY MIGHT BE HEARD TALKING TOGETHER IN VOICES BETWEEN A SPEECH AND A SNORE AND WITH THAT LACK OF ENERGY THAT DISTINGUISHES THE OCCUPANTS OF ALMS-HOUSES AND ALL OTHER HUMAN BEINGS WHO DEPEND FOR SUBSISTENCE ON CHARITY ON MONOPOLIZED LABOUR OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT EXERTIONS
HER INTELLECT AND HEART HAD THEIR HOME AS IT WERE IN DESERT PLACES WHERE SHE ROAMED AS FREELY AS THE WILD INDIAN IN HIS WOODS
THEN TELL ME WHAT THOU SEEST HUSH HESTER--HUSH SAID HE WITH TREMULOUS SOLEMNITY
AND THERE WAS PEARL TOO LIGHTLY DANCING FROM THE MARGIN OF THE BROOK--NOW THAT THE INTRUSIVE THIRD PERSON WAS GONE--AND TAKING HER OLD PLACE BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE
AND WHEN THE MINISTER THREW HIS STARTLED EYES TOWARDS HIM THERE THE PHYSICIAN SAT
BECAUSE ITS EXISTENCE HERETOFORE HAD BROUGHT IT ACQUAINTANCE ONLY WITH THE GREY TWILIGHT OF A DUNGEON OR OTHER DARKSOME APARTMENT OF THE PRISON
THE NEXT DAY HOWEVER BEING THE SABBATH HE PREACHED A DISCOURSE WHICH WAS HELD TO BE THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL AND THE MOST REPLETE WITH HEAVENLY INFLUENCES THAT HAD EVER PROCEEDED FROM HIS LIPS
THE SENTIMENT IS PROBABLY ASSIGNABLE TO THE DEEP AND AGED ROOTS WHICH MY FAMILY HAS STUCK INTO THE SOIL
THE AGED MEMBERS OF HIS FLOCK BEHOLDING MR DIMMESDALE'S FRAME SO FEEBLE WHILE THEY WERE THEMSELVES SO RUGGED IN THEIR INFIRMITY BELIEVED THAT HE WOULD GO HEAVENWARD BEFORE THEM AND ENJOINED IT UPON THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEIR OLD BONES SHOULD BE BURIED CLOSE TO THEIR YOUNG PASTOR'S HOLY GRAVE
TRUST ME GOOD JAILER YOU SHALL BRIEFLY HAVE PEACE IN YOUR HOUSE
MAY GOD FORGIVE US BOTH
THE PAGE OF LIFE THAT WAS SPREAD OUT BEFORE ME SEEMED DULL AND COMMONPLACE ONLY BECAUSE I HAD NOT FATHOMED ITS DEEPER IMPORT
WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM LOOKING WITH SURPRISE AT THE SCARLET LITTLE FIGURE BEFORE HIM
THOU SHALT FORGIVE WITH SUDDEN AND DESPERATE TENDERNESS SHE THREW HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PRESSED HIS HEAD AGAINST HER BOSOM LITTLE CARING THOUGH HIS CHEEK RESTED ON THE SCARLET LETTER
ALTHOUGH THE MUSIC STILL PLAYED THE STATELY AND REJOICING MARCH TO WHICH THE PROCESSION MOVED
SHE DECIDED MOREOVER THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO HER UTMOST AID
SEE YE NOT SHE IS THE SCARLET LETTER ONLY CAPABLE OF BEING LOVED AND SO ENDOWED WITH A MILLIONFOLD THE POWER OF RETRIBUTION FOR MY SIN
IT PERPLEXED AS WELL AS SHOCKED HER BY THE IRREVERENT INOPPORTUNENESS OF THE OCCASIONS THAT BROUGHT IT INTO VIVID ACTION
THE MYSTIC TOKEN ALIGHTED ON THE HITHER VERGE OF THE STREAM
AND YET THE MINISTER'S DEEPEST SENSE SEEMED TO INFORM HIM OF THEIR MUTABILITY
FOR THEY HAD IMBIBED FROM THEIR PARENTS A VAGUE IDEA OF SOMETHING HORRIBLE IN THIS DREARY WOMAN GLIDING SILENTLY THROUGH THE TOWN WITH NEVER ANY COMPANION BUT ONE ONLY CHILD
ENOUGH IT IS MY PURPOSE TO LIVE AND DIE UNKNOWN
OR BY WHATEVER OTHER INTANGIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS THEN AS NOW SUFFICIENT TO BESTOW ON SOME PERSONS WHAT OTHERS MIGHT SEEK IN VAIN
ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HAD BY THIS TIME APPROACHED THE WINDOW AND SMILED GRIMLY DOWN
EXCEPT PERHAPS A BARK OR BRIG HALF-WAY DOWN ITS MELANCHOLY LENGTH DISCHARGING HIDES
NO EVIL OF THE PAST BE REDEEMED BY BETTER SERVICE
AND ABOVE IT ROSE THE FRAMEWORK OF THAT INSTRUMENT OF DISCIPLINE SO FASHIONED AS TO CONFINE THE HUMAN HEAD IN ITS TIGHT GRASP AND THUS HOLD IT UP TO THE PUBLIC GAZE
BUT FOR ALL THAT THEY WERE IN ONE SENSE THE TRUEST AND MOST SUBSTANTIAL THINGS WHICH THE POOR MINISTER NOW DEALT WITH
THE FAULT WAS MINE
SAGACIOUSLY UNDER THEIR SPECTACLES DID THEY PEEP INTO THE HOLDS OF VESSELS
THE YOUNG DIVINE WHOSE SCHOLAR-LIKE RENOWN STILL LIVED IN OXFORD WAS CONSIDERED BY HIS MORE FERVENT ADMIRERS AS LITTLE LESS THAN A HEAVENLY ORDAINED APOSTLE DESTINED SHOULD HE LIVE AND LABOUR FOR THE ORDINARY TERM OF LIFE TO DO AS GREAT DEEDS FOR THE NOW FEEBLE NEW ENGLAND CHURCH AS THE EARLY FATHERS HAD ACHIEVED FOR THE INFANCY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
HESTER COMFORTED AND COUNSELLED THEM AS BEST SHE MIGHT
IT APPALLED HER NEVERTHELESS TO DISCERN HERE AGAIN A SHADOWY REFLECTION OF THE EVIL THAT HAD EXISTED IN HERSELF
MUCH AND DESERVEDLY TO MY OWN DISCREDIT THEREFORE AND CONSIDERABLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY OFFICIAL CONSCIENCE THEY CONTINUED DURING MY INCUMBENCY TO CREEP ABOUT THE WHARVES AND LOITER UP AND DOWN THE CUSTOM-HOUSE STEPS
THOU HAST KEPT THE SECRET OF THY PARAMOUR
IN ALL HER WALKS ABOUT THE TOWN PEARL TOO WAS THERE
IT KEPT HIM DOWN ON A LEVEL WITH THE LOWEST
AS REGARDED ITS ORIGIN THERE WERE VARIOUS EXPLANATIONS ALL OF WHICH MUST NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN CONJECTURAL
WHO MADE ME SO IT WAS MYSELF CRIED HESTER SHUDDERING
MEAGRE INDEED AND COLD WAS THE SYMPATHY THAT A TRANSGRESSOR MIGHT LOOK FOR FROM SUCH BYSTANDERS AT THE SCAFFOLD
IT MAY NOT BE TOO MUCH TO AFFIRM ON THE WHOLE THE PEOPLE BEING THEN IN THE FIRST STAGES OF JOYLESS DEPORTMENT AND THE OFFSPRING OF SIRES WHO HAD KNOWN HOW TO BE MERRY IN THEIR DAY THAT THEY WOULD COMPARE FAVOURABLY IN POINT OF HOLIDAY KEEPING WITH THEIR DESCENDANTS EVEN AT SO LONG AN INTERVAL AS OURSELVES
THERE WAS NO PERIL OF DISCOVERY
THOU WEAREST IT OPENLY SO THERE NEED BE NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT
A TENDENCY TO SPECULATION THOUGH IT MAY KEEP WOMEN QUIET AS IT DOES MAN YET MAKES HER SAD
HE LOOKED NOW MORE CAREWORN AND EMACIATED THAN AS WE DESCRIBED HIM AT THE SCENE OF HESTER'S PUBLIC IGNOMINY
THE PROCESSION WAS TO BE MARSHALLED THENCE TO THE TOWN HALL WHERE A SOLEMN BANQUET WOULD COMPLETE THE CEREMONIES OF THE DAY
IS THERE NO REALITY IN THE PENITENCE THUS SEALED AND WITNESSED BY GOOD WORKS
WITH ALL THIS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS DECLINE THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION OF THE FACT
HE LOOKED HAGGARD AND FEEBLE AND BETRAYED A NERVELESS DESPONDENCY IN HIS AIR WHICH HAD NEVER SO REMARKABLY CHARACTERISED HIM IN HIS WALKS ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT NOR IN ANY OTHER SITUATION WHERE HE DEEMED HIMSELF LIABLE TO NOTICE
H
H
LEAP ACROSS THE BROOK AND COME TO US
IF THIS BE THE PRICE OF THE CHILD'S SYMPATHY I CANNOT PAY IT THEN SHE SPOKE ALOUD SILLY PEARL SAID SHE WHAT QUESTIONS ARE THESE
BUT THEN WHAT REAMS OF OTHER MANUSCRIPTS--FILLED NOT WITH THE DULNESS OF OFFICIAL FORMALITIES BUT WITH THE THOUGHT OF INVENTIVE BRAINS AND THE RICH EFFUSION OF DEEP HEARTS--HAD GONE EQUALLY TO OBLIVION
HERE ON THE CUSHION LAY A FOLIO TOME PROBABLY OF THE CHRONICLES OF ENGLAND OR OTHER SUCH SUBSTANTIAL LITERATURE
PRODUCED BY DARTMOUTH COLLEGE THE SCARLET LETTER BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE EDITOR'S NOTE NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE WAS ALREADY A MAN OF FORTY-SIX AND A TALE WRITER OF SOME TWENTY-FOUR YEARS STANDING WHEN THE SCARLET LETTER APPEARED
PHYSICAL COMPULSION OR RESTRAINT WAS EFFECTUAL OF COURSE WHILE IT LASTED
FOR IT IS NOT IN YOUR DAYS AS IT WAS IN MINE WHEN A MAN'S OFFICE WAS A LIFE-LEASE AND OFTENTIMES AN HEIRLOOM
NOW WAS HEARD AGAIN THE CLAMOUR OF THE MUSIC AND THE MEASURED TRAMP OF THE MILITARY ESCORT ISSUING FROM THE CHURCH DOOR
MINE WAS THE FIRST WRONG WHEN I BETRAYED THY BUDDING YOUTH INTO A FALSE AND UNNATURAL RELATION WITH MY DECAY
AFTER A BRIEF SPACE THE CONVULSION GREW ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE AND FINALLY SUBSIDED INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS NATURE
SOONER OR LATER HE MUST NEEDS BE MINE THE EYES OF THE WRINKLED SCHOLAR GLOWED SO INTENSELY UPON HER THAT HESTER PRYNNE CLASPED HER HAND OVER HER HEART DREADING LEST HE SHOULD READ THE SECRET THERE AT ONCE
SUFFICE IT HERE TO SAY THAT A CUSTOM-HOUSE OFFICER OF LONG CONTINUANCE CAN HARDLY BE A VERY PRAISEWORTHY OR RESPECTABLE PERSONAGE FOR MANY REASONS
IN HER WAS VISIBLE THE TIE THAT UNITED THEM
THERE IS NOT THE STRENGTH OR COURAGE LEFT ME TO VENTURE INTO THE WIDE STRANGE DIFFICULT WORLD ALONE IT WAS THE LAST EXPRESSION OF THE DESPONDENCY OF A BROKEN SPIRIT
EVEN YET THOUGH MY THOUGHTS WERE ULTIMATELY MUCH ABSORBED IN THE TASK IT WEARS TO MY EYE A STERN AND SOMBRE ASPECT
WHY SHOULD A WRETCHED MAN--GUILTY WE WILL SAY OF MURDER--PREFER TO KEEP THE DEAD CORPSE BURIED IN HIS OWN HEART RATHER THAN FLING IT FORTH AT ONCE AND LET THE UNIVERSE TAKE CARE OF IT YET SOME MEN BURY THEIR SECRETS THUS OBSERVED THE CALM PHYSICIAN
I FREELY FORGIVE YOU NOW
THIS CHILD OF ITS FATHER'S GUILT AND ITS MOTHER'S SHAME HAS COME FROM THE HAND OF GOD TO WORK IN MANY WAYS UPON HER HEART WHO PLEADS SO EARNESTLY AND WITH SUCH BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT THE RIGHT TO KEEP HER
HE HATH DONE A WILD THING ERE NOW THIS PIOUS MASTER DIMMESDALE IN THE HOT PASSION OF HIS HEART IT PROVED NOT DIFFICULT TO RE-ESTABLISH THE INTIMACY OF THE TWO COMPANIONS ON THE SAME FOOTING AND IN THE SAME DEGREE AS HERETOFORE
BUT HOW IT WAS TO BE WORN OR WHAT RANK HONOUR AND DIGNITY IN BY-PAST TIMES WERE SIGNIFIED BY IT WAS A RIDDLE WHICH SO EVANESCENT ARE THE FASHIONS OF THE WORLD IN THESE PARTICULARS I SAW LITTLE HOPE OF SOLVING
HE LISTENED IN SILENCE AND FINALLY PROMISED TO CONFER WITH THE PHYSICIAN
SINCE HIS SIRE A REVOLUTIONARY COLONEL AND FORMERLY COLLECTOR OF THE PORT HAD CREATED AN OFFICE FOR HIM AND APPOINTED HIM TO FILL IT AT A PERIOD OF THE EARLY AGES WHICH FEW LIVING MEN CAN NOW REMEMBER
ELSE I WOULD HAVE RUN TO HIM AND BID HIM KISS ME NOW BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE EVEN AS HE DID YONDER AMONG THE DARK OLD TREES
THE CHILD BENT HER CHIN UPON HER BREAST AND CONTEMPLATED THIS DEVICE WITH STRANGE INTEREST EVEN AS IF THE ONE ONLY THING FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SENT INTO THE WORLD WAS TO MAKE OUT ITS HIDDEN IMPORT
THERE WAS PERHAPS A FORTUNATE DISORDER IN HIS UTTERANCE WHICH FAILED TO IMPART ANY DISTINCT IDEA TO THE GOOD WIDOWS COMPREHENSION OR WHICH PROVIDENCE INTERPRETED AFTER A METHOD OF ITS OWN
THE MINISTER--PAINFULLY EMBARRASSED BUT HOPING THAT A KISS MIGHT PROVE A TALISMAN TO ADMIT HIM INTO THE CHILD'S KINDLIER REGARDS--BENT FORWARD AND IMPRESSED ONE ON HER BROW
IT IS A GOOD LESSON--THOUGH IT MAY OFTEN BE A HARD ONE--FOR A MAN WHO HAS DREAMED OF LITERARY FAME AND OF MAKING FOR HIMSELF A RANK AMONG THE WORLD'S DIGNITARIES BY SUCH MEANS TO STEP ASIDE OUT OF THE NARROW CIRCLE IN WHICH HIS CLAIMS ARE RECOGNIZED AND TO FIND HOW UTTERLY DEVOID OF SIGNIFICANCE BEYOND THAT CIRCLE IS ALL THAT HE ACHIEVES AND ALL HE AIMS AT
THEY WOULD HAVE VAINLY SOUGHT--HAD THEY EVER DREAMED OF SEEKING--TO EXPRESS THE HIGHEST TRUTHS THROUGH THE HUMBLEST MEDIUM OF FAMILIAR WORDS AND IMAGES
ITS RANKS WERE FILLED WITH GENTLEMEN WHO FELT THE STIRRINGS OF MARTIAL IMPULSE AND SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF COLLEGE OF ARMS WHERE AS IN AN ASSOCIATION OF KNIGHTS TEMPLARS THEY MIGHT LEARN THE SCIENCE AND SO FAR AS PEACEFUL EXERCISE WOULD TEACH THEM THE PRACTICES OF WAR
THERE WAS A SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CHARACTERISED MR DIMMESDALE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE AT THIS MOMENT
ASSUREDLY AS THE MINISTER LOOKED BACK HE BEHELD AN EXPRESSION OF DIVINE GRATITUDE AND ECSTASY THAT SEEMED LIKE THE SHINE OF THE CELESTIAL CITY ON HER FACE SO WRINKLED AND ASHY PALE
THE MINISTER--FOR SAVE THE LONG-SOUGHT REGARDS OF WOMAN NOTHING IS SWEETER THAN THESE MARKS OF CHILDISH PREFERENCE ACCORDED SPONTANEOUSLY BY A SPIRITUAL INSTINCT AND THEREFORE SEEMING TO IMPLY IN US SOMETHING TRULY WORTHY TO BE LOVED--THE MINISTER LOOKED ROUND LAID HIS HAND ON THE CHILD'S HEAD HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN KISSED HER BROW
COME HESTER--COME
FOR YEARS PAST SHE HAD LOOKED FROM THIS ESTRANGED POINT OF VIEW AT HUMAN INSTITUTIONS AND WHATEVER PRIESTS OR LEGISLATORS HAD ESTABLISHED
DO YOU SEE THAT WOMAN WITH THE EMBROIDERED BADGE THEY WOULD SAY TO STRANGERS
HER MOTHER WITH THE SCARLET LETTER ON HER BREAST GLITTERING IN ITS FANTASTIC EMBROIDERY HAD LONG BEEN A FAMILIAR OBJECT TO THE TOWNSPEOPLE
THE ANCIENT SURVEYOR--BEING LITTLE MOLESTED I SUPPOSE AT THAT EARLY DAY WITH BUSINESS PERTAINING TO HIS OFFICE--SEEMS TO HAVE DEVOTED SOME OF HIS MANY LEISURE HOURS TO RESEARCHES AS A LOCAL ANTIQUARIAN AND OTHER INQUISITIONS OF A SIMILAR NATURE
DO THIS SAID THE GHOST OF MR SURVEYOR PUE EMPHATICALLY NODDING THE HEAD THAT LOOKED SO IMPOSING WITHIN ITS MEMORABLE WIG
WHENEVER PEARL SAW ANYTHING TO EXCITE HER EVER ACTIVE AND WANDERING CURIOSITY SHE FLEW THITHERWARD AND AS WE MIGHT SAY SEIZED UPON THAT MAN OR THING AS HER OWN PROPERTY SO FAR AS SHE DESIRED IT BUT WITHOUT YIELDING THE MINUTEST DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER HER MOTIONS IN REQUITAL
AND WERE HE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE TO THE END OF TIME WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD AS HE WAS THEN AND SIT DOWN TO DINNER WITH JUST AS GOOD AN APPETITE
ONE POINT IN WHICH HE HAD VASTLY THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIS FOUR-FOOTED BRETHREN WAS HIS ABILITY TO RECOLLECT THE GOOD DINNERS WHICH IT HAD MADE NO SMALL PORTION OF THE HAPPINESS OF HIS LIFE TO EAT
THEY WERE APART FROM ME
THOU THYSELF WILT SEE IT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
YE THAT HAVE WRONGED ME ARE NOT SINFUL SAVE IN A KIND OF TYPICAL ILLUSION
TO THIS EXTENT AND WITHIN THESE LIMITS AN AUTHOR METHINKS MAY BE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL WITHOUT VIOLATING EITHER THE READER'S RIGHTS OR HIS OWN
FAMOUS OLD PEOPLE GRANDFATHER'S CHAIR 1841 LIBERTY TREE
HE MIGHT TRULY BE TERMED A LEGITIMATE SON OF THE REVENUE SYSTEM DYED IN THE WOOL OR RATHER BORN IN THE PURPLE
AN ENEMY
IF HE HAVE THE POWER WHICH MUST BE BORN WITH HIM TO BRING HIS MIND INTO SUCH AFFINITY WITH HIS PATIENT'S THAT THIS LAST SHALL UNAWARES HAVE SPOKEN WHAT HE IMAGINES HIMSELF ONLY TO HAVE THOUGHT
SO TO THEIR OWN UNUTTERABLE TORMENT THEY GO ABOUT AMONG THEIR FELLOW-CREATURES LOOKING PURE AS NEW-FALLEN SNOW WHILE THEIR HEARTS ARE ALL SPECKLED AND SPOTTED WITH INIQUITY OF WHICH THEY CANNOT RID THEMSELVES THESE MEN DECEIVE THEMSELVES SAID ROGER CHILLINGWORTH WITH SOMEWHAT MORE EMPHASIS THAN USUAL AND MAKING A SLIGHT GESTURE WITH HIS FOREFINGER
AND WAS THIS THE MAN
AGAIN ANOTHER INCIDENT OF THE SAME NATURE
THE INTELLECT OF ROGER CHILLINGWORTH HAD NOW A SUFFICIENTLY PLAIN PATH BEFORE IT
THAT SURELY WERE A SHALLOW VIEW OF IT
THAT HAVE MADE THEE FEEBLE TO WILL AND TO DO
SHE WAS TERROR-STRICKEN BY THE REVELATIONS THAT WERE THUS MADE
SHOULDST THOU FAIL ME IN THIS BEWARE
HE COULD NOT BUT RECALL HOW FEEBLY AND WITH WHAT FREQUENT PAUSES FOR BREATH HE HAD TOILED OVER THE SAME GROUND ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE
NO EYE COULD SEE HIM SAVE THAT EVER-WAKEFUL ONE WHICH HAD SEEN HIM IN HIS CLOSET WIELDING THE BLOODY SCOURGE
AS HE POSSESSED NO HIGHER ATTRIBUTE AND NEITHER SACRIFICED NOR VITIATED ANY SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT BY DEVOTING ALL HIS ENERGIES AND INGENUITIES TO SUBSERVE THE DELIGHT AND PROFIT OF HIS MAW IT ALWAYS PLEASED AND SATISFIED ME TO HEAR HIM EXPATIATE ON FISH POULTRY AND BUTCHER'S MEAT AND THE MOST ELIGIBLE METHODS OF PREPARING THEM FOR THE TABLE
THEY WERE NATIVE ENGLISHMEN WHOSE FATHERS HAD LIVED IN THE SUNNY RICHNESS OF THE ELIZABETHAN EPOCH
AS IF A GOOD AND GOLDEN YEAR WERE AT LENGTH TO PASS OVER THE POOR OLD WORLD IT WAS AS HESTER SAID IN REGARD TO THE UNWONTED JOLLITY THAT BRIGHTENED THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE
I USED TO WATCH AND STUDY THIS PATRIARCHAL PERSONAGE WITH I THINK LIVELIER CURIOSITY THAN ANY OTHER FORM OF HUMANITY THERE PRESENTED TO MY NOTICE
A STAIN ON HIS CONSCIENCE AS TO ANYTHING THAT CAME WITHIN THE RANGE OF HIS VOCATION WOULD TROUBLE SUCH A MAN VERY MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THOUGH TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN AN ERROR IN THE BALANCE OF AN ACCOUNT OR AN INK-BLOT ON THE FAIR PAGE OF A BOOK OF RECORD
NEAR THIS LATTER SPOT ONE AFTERNOON SOME CHILDREN WERE AT PLAY WHEN THEY BEHELD A TALL WOMAN IN A GRAY ROBE APPROACH THE COTTAGE-DOOR
IT IS MY BELIEF HOWEVER THAT HAD I ATTEMPTED A DIFFERENT ORDER OF COMPOSITION MY FACULTIES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND SO POINTLESS AND INEFFICACIOUS
THE PEOPLE KNEW NOT THE POWER THAT MOVED THEM THUS
HE WAS SMALL IN STATURE WITH A FURROWED VISAGE WHICH AS YET COULD HARDLY BE TERMED AGED
IT WAS THE SAME TOWN AS HERETOFORE BUT THE SAME MINISTER RETURNED NOT FROM THE FOREST
IT WAS MEANT DOUBTLESS THE MOTHER HERSELF HATH TOLD US FOR A RETRIBUTION TOO
PRYING FURTHER INTO THE MANUSCRIPT I FOUND THE RECORD OF OTHER DOINGS AND SUFFERINGS OF THIS SINGULAR WOMAN FOR MOST OF WHICH THE READER IS REFERRED TO THE STORY ENTITLED THE SCARLET LETTER
ALL THIS ENMITY AND PASSION HAD PEARL INHERITED BY INALIENABLE RIGHT OUT OF HESTER'S HEART
IT GROVELLED HELPLESS ON THE GROUND EVEN WHILE HIS INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES RETAINED THEIR PRISTINE STRENGTH OR HAD PERHAPS ACQUIRED A MORBID ENERGY WHICH DISEASE ONLY COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM
IT IS THAT OF THE COLLECTOR OUR GALLANT OLD GENERAL WHO AFTER HIS BRILLIANT MILITARY SERVICE SUBSEQUENTLY TO WHICH HE HAD RULED OVER A WILD WESTERN TERRITORY HAD COME HITHER TWENTY YEARS BEFORE TO SPEND THE DECLINE OF HIS VARIED AND HONOURABLE LIFE
HESTER PRYNNE IMBIBED THIS SPIRIT
SUCH AS EVER SINCE OLD CATHOLIC TIMES HAD OCCASIONALLY BEEN SEEN ON EARTH THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THEIR MOTHER'S SIN AND TO PROMOTE SOME FOUL AND WICKED PURPOSE
DEEPER IT GOES AND DEEPER INTO THE WILDERNESS LESS PLAINLY TO BE SEEN AT EVERY STEP
WHY MISTRESS I HEAR GOOD TIDINGS OF YOU ON ALL HANDS
EVEN LITTLE BABES WHEN I TAKE THEM IN MY ARMS WEEP BITTERLY
MADMAN HOLD
IN THIS ONE CHILD THERE WERE MANY CHILDREN COMPREHENDING THE FULL SCOPE BETWEEN THE WILD-FLOWER PRETTINESS OF A PEASANT-BABY AND THE POMP IN LITTLE OF AN INFANT PRINCESS
ALL THAT DARK TREASURE TO BE LAVISHED ON THE VERY MAN TO WHOM NOTHING ELSE COULD SO ADEQUATELY PAY THE DEBT OF VENGEANCE
THE MINISTER TREMULOUSLY BUT DECIDEDLY REPELLED THE OLD MAN'S ARM
NOT TO AN EARTHLY PHYSICIAN CRIED MR DIMMESDALE PASSIONATELY AND TURNING HIS EYES FULL AND BRIGHT AND WITH A KIND OF FIERCENESS ON OLD ROGER CHILLINGWORTH
NONE--NOTHING BUT DESPAIR HE ANSWERED
NOT PRECISELY A LOOK OF FEAR YET FULL OF DOUBT AND QUESTIONING AS TO WHAT HIS PURPOSES MIGHT BE
FROM THAT EPOCH EXCEPT WHEN THE CHILD WAS ASLEEP HESTER HAD NEVER FELT A MOMENT'S SAFETY
ANY OTHER OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE SEEN FEW BUT UNAMIABLE TRAITS AND HAVE GIVEN THEM A FAR DARKER COLOURING
IN THE BROOK BENEATH STOOD ANOTHER CHILD--ANOTHER AND THE SAME--WITH LIKEWISE ITS RAY OF GOLDEN LIGHT
IT WAS REPORTED AND BELIEVED BY MANY THAT AN INDIAN HAD DRAWN HIS ARROW AGAINST THE BADGE AND THAT THE MISSILE STRUCK IT AND FELL HARMLESS TO THE GROUND
VERILY AND IN GOOD FAITH ANSWERED ROGER CHILLINGWORTH I KNEW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
THE PERSONS NOW IN THE MARKET-PLACE OF BOSTON HAD NOT BEEN BORN TO AN INHERITANCE OF PURITANIC GLOOM
SHE HAD FLOURISHED DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE EARLY DAYS OF MASSACHUSETTS AND THE CLOSE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
HE MAY NOD AT THEE IF HE WILL
HESTER PRYNNE CRIED HE WITH A PIERCING EARNESTNESS IN THE NAME OF HIM SO TERRIBLE AND SO MERCIFUL WHO GIVES ME GRACE AT THIS LAST MOMENT TO DO WHAT--FOR MY OWN HEAVY SIN AND MISERABLE AGONY--I WITHHELD MYSELF FROM DOING SEVEN YEARS AGO COME HITHER NOW AND TWINE THY STRENGTH ABOUT ME
SO POWERFUL WAS ITS RADIANCE THAT IT THOROUGHLY ILLUMINATED THE DENSE MEDIUM OF CLOUD BETWIXT THE SKY AND EARTH
TELL ME REPEATED PEARL NO LONGER SERIOUSLY BUT LAUGHING AND CAPERING ABOUT THE FLOOR
THE VERY FIRST THING WHICH SHE HAD NOTICED IN HER LIFE WAS--WHAT?--NOT THE MOTHER'S SMILE RESPONDING TO IT AS OTHER BABIES DO BY THAT FAINT EMBRYO SMILE OF THE LITTLE MOUTH REMEMBERED SO DOUBTFULLY AFTERWARDS AND WITH SUCH FOND DISCUSSION WHETHER IT WERE INDEED A SMILE
IN ONE CASE HOWEVER IT IS REAL SUNSHINE
IF HERETOFORE I HAD BEEN NONE OF THE WARMEST OF PARTISANS I BEGAN NOW AT THIS SEASON OF PERIL AND ADVERSITY TO BE PRETTY ACUTELY SENSIBLE WITH WHICH PARTY MY PREDILECTIONS LAY
FOR SHE FELT THAT--HAVING NOW DONE ALL THAT HUMANITY OR PRINCIPLE OR IF SO IT WERE A REFINED CRUELTY IMPELLED HIM TO DO FOR THE RELIEF OF PHYSICAL SUFFERING--HE WAS NEXT TO TREAT WITH HER AS THE MAN WHOM SHE HAD MOST DEEPLY AND IRREPARABLY INJURED
IN THESE LENGTHENED VIGILS HIS BRAIN OFTEN REELED AND VISIONS SEEMED TO FLIT BEFORE HIM
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN WITHIN THE VERGE OF THE PENINSULA BUT NOT IN CLOSE VICINITY TO ANY OTHER HABITATION THERE WAS A SMALL THATCHED COTTAGE
AFTER THOSE WILD FREE DAYS ON THE ASSABETH INDULGING FANTASTIC SPECULATIONS BESIDE OUR FIRE OF FALLEN BOUGHS WITH ELLERY CHANNING
THOU WILT HAVE TWICE AS MUCH LOVE HENCEFORWARD AS THY MOTHER ALONE COULD GIVE THEE
AND SO HE HAD
LIVE THEREFORE AND BEAR ABOUT THY DOOM WITH THEE IN THE EYES OF MEN AND WOMEN--IN THE EYES OF HIM WHOM THOU DIDST CALL THY HUSBAND--IN THE EYES OF YONDER CHILD
WHAT CAN A RUINED SOUL LIKE MINE EFFECT TOWARDS THE REDEMPTION OF OTHER SOULS?--OR A POLLUTED SOUL TOWARDS THEIR PURIFICATION
A BITTER KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT
HESTER SAID THE CLERGYMAN FAREWELL SHALL WE NOT MEET AGAIN WHISPERED SHE BENDING HER FACE DOWN CLOSE TO HIS
