I CANNOT USE ANOTHER MAGIC CHARM UNTIL THREE DAYS HAVE EXPIRED BUT IF THEY DO NOT HARM CAP'N BILL DURING THAT TIME I BELIEVE I CAN THEN FIND A WAY TO SAVE HIM THREE DAYS IS A LONG TIME REMARKED TROT DISMALLY
CAP'N BILL SAT IN HIS SEAT JUST IN FRONT OF THEM ALL BEING UPON THE GROUND
SO YOU NEEDN'T THINK OF TRYING TO KILL ANYBODY ON SKY ISLAND
AND IN ORDER THAT THE SLICING WOULD BE ACCURATE THERE WAS ANOTHER FRAME TO WHICH THE PRISONER WAS TIED SO THAT HE COULDN'T WIGGLE EITHER WAY
ITS SHOULDERS AND FRONT LEGS WERE HUGE AND POWERFUL BUT THE REST OF THE WOLF'S BODY DWINDLED AWAY UNTIL AT THE TAIL IT WAS NO BIGGER THAN A DOG
FOR ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ANXIOUS TO GET THROUGH THE FOG BANK THEY WERE TIRED WITH THE LONG RUN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WITH THEIR DAY'S ADVENTURES
FOR A MOMENT THE PRISONERS COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM BUT PRESENTLY HALF A DOZEN BLUESKINS RESEMBLING IN SHAPE AND COSTUME THEIR RULER BUT LESS MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED STEPPED IN FRONT OF THEM AND BOWED LOW TO THE BOOLOOROO
SHE DIDN'T KNOW I LIVED IN PHILADELPHIA
THEY CUT TWO OF US IN HALVES AND MISMATCH THE HALVES--HALF OF ONE TO HALF OF THE OTHER YOU KNOW--AND THEN THE OTHER TWO HALVES ARE PATCHED TOGETHER
WE'LL SEE REPLIED CAP'N BILL AND BEGAN TO THINK VERY DEEPLY
THE BLUESKINS HAD NOT LIKED THEIR BOOLOOROO BEFORE THIS AND NOW THEY BEGAN TO HATE HIM FORGETTING THEY HAD ALSO TREATED THE STRANGERS IN A VERY DISAGREEABLE MANNER
AN WANTED FER TO PATCH US ADDED CAP'N BILL INDIGNANTLY
IF ALL'S RIGHT AN SHIPSHAPE THEN WE CAN START FOR THE ISLAND THEY PUT THE BROAD DOUBLE SEAT ON THE GROUND AND THEN THE BOY AND GIRL SAT IN THEIR PLACES AND BUTTON-BRIGHT SPREAD OPEN THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
NO ONE BUT YOU TWO SAID THE BOY FOLLOWING AFTER TROT WITH HIS UMBRELLA TUCKED CAREFULLY UNDERNEATH HIS ARM
TROT SAW THROUGH THIS CUNNING SCHEME AT ONCE SO THE FIRST THING SHE DID WAS TO UNTIE THE CORD FROM CAP'N BILL'S BIG TOE AND RETIE IT TO A LEG OF THE LOUNGE
I SHALL MAKE OLD MOONFACE MY NAME'S CAP'N BILL WEEDLES INTERRUPTED THE SAILOR
AND IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY ALL SHARE MY KNOWLEDGE YOU SHALL SEE THE VISION AS I SEE IT SHE THEN BOWED HER HEAD AND CLOSED HER EYES
I'LL BE THE RULER THAT SHALL BE MY PRIVILEGE SHOUTED SAPPHIRE
HERE SHE SAID PRESENTLY IS A LAW WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS
THEN THE UMBRELLA DROPPED FAR BELOW THE ARCH WHICH PRESENTLY FADED FROM VIEW
ONLY THOSE ABLE TO FORGET FIND THE MOST JOY IN LIFE DURING THIS CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE STREETS OF THE BLUE CITY WHERE MANY OF THE BLUESKIN INHABITANTS STOPPED TO GAZE WONDERINGLY AT THE SAILOR AND THE BOY WHOSE STRANGE APPEARANCE SURPRISED THEM
YOU MAY BE THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES BUT YOU AIN'T EVEN A TIN WHISTLE TO US AN YOU CAN'T SKEER US FOR HALF A MINUTE
FOR WHEN YOU'RE GONE THE BOOLOOROO WILL HAVE NO ONE TO PATCH CAP'N BILL TO HE MAY FIND SOME ONE ELSE SUGGESTED THE PRISONER
CAP'N BILL SAT FLAT UPON THE GROUND LANDING WITH A FORCE THAT JARRED THE SAILORMAN AND MADE HIS TEETH CLICK TOGETHER WHILE DOWN UPON HIM CAME THE SEAT THAT TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT OCCUPIED SO THAT FOR A MOMENT THEY WERE ALL TANGLED UP
NO FLOWERS GREW NEAR IT
I CAN'T FIND IT
DON'T CRY!--BYE-BYE SHOUTED THE PARROT FROM THE PINK WITCH'S SHOULDER
TAKE ME TO BUFFALO UP IN THE AIR I WENT JUST AS SOON AS I SAID IT AND THE UMBRELLA SAILED SO FAST THAT I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A GALE OF WIND
TROT DREW A LONG BREATH
LET THAT ALONE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT MAKING A GRAB FOR IT
SO THE STRANGE BOY WAS GLAD TO MEET HIM
WHO HAS RELEASED TIGGLE
I MUST ASK SOME ONE ELSE TO CAST THE DECIDING VOTE WHO WILL IT BE THEN INQUIRED TROT
I'M AS WET AS A DISH RAG NOW AND I'LL NEVER GET ANY WETTER WET WET WET
I'LL RULE IT I'LL RULE IT MYSELF CRIED CERULIA
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S TO BE DONE WE OUGHT TO GET HOME OBSERVED THE BOY
AT ONCE THE LAMB BEGAN CHATTERING JUST AS A MONKEY CHATTERS ONLY IN THE MOST FRIENDLY AND GRATEFUL WAY AND TROT FED IT A HANDFUL OF FRESH BLUE CLOVER AND SMOOTHED AND PETTED IT UNTIL THE LAMB WAS EAGER TO FOLLOW HER WHEREVER SHE MIGHT GO
THE KING THREW THEM AT HIS HEAD AIMING CAREFULLY BUT BUTTON-BRIGHT DODGED THE MISSILES AND ONE SMASHED A MIRROR WHILE THE OTHER SHATTERED A VASE ON A SMALL TABLE
THE UMBRELLA IN BUTTON-BRIGHT'S HAND BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND SHAKE
THE MAGIC UMBRELLA MAINTAINED A UNIFORM SPEED SWIFT AND UNFALTERING BUT ITS PATH THROUGH THE HEAVENS WAS NOW IN THE SHAPE OF AN ARCH AS A FLYING ARROW FALLS
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU WILL BE PUNISHED FOR YOUR IMPUDENCE
YOU AND WE ARE ABOUT ALIKE NOW JIMFRED ALTHOUGH WE WERE SO DIFFERENT BEFORE NOT SO SAID JIMFRED
DID YOU SAY MAGIC UMBREL BUTTON-BRIGHT I SAID MAGIC BUT NONE OF OUR FAMILY KNEW IT WAS A MAGIC UMBRELLA TILL I FOUND IT OUT FOR MYSELF
THEY SAW THE MOON RISE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES AND ITS COLD SILVERY RADIANCE MADE THEM SHUDDER AND PREVENTED THEM FROM GOING TO SLEEP
THEY COULD EAT UP OUR WHOLE ARMY IF THEY WANTED TO BUT JUST THEN WHILE THEY STOOD DISMAYED AT THIS UNFORTUNATE POSITION A QUEER THING HAPPENED
BY THE TIME THE BOY CAME UP TO IT CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY TROT AND CAP'N BILL THE THING WAS ONLY THE WELL-KNOWN MAGIC UMBRELLA WITH THE CARVED ELEPHANT'S HEAD FOR A HANDLE AND IT LAY MOTIONLESS UPON THE GROUND
CAP'N BILL IS ALSO A NEW CHARACTER WHO SEEMS TO HAVE WON APPROVAL AND SO BOTH TROT AND THE OLD SAILOR ARE AGAIN INTRODUCED IN THE PRESENT STORY WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE SECOND OF THE SERIES OF ADVENTURES OF TROT AND CAP'N BILL
GET OFF
ISN'T THERE SOME HOUSE IN THE CITY THEY CAN ALL LIVE IN GHIP WHY I OWN A LITTLE CABIN AT THE END OF THE TOWN SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND I'LL LET THEM USE THAT AS I WON'T NEED IT ANY LONGER
SHE FURTHER ORDERED A PINK STATUE OF TOURMALINE TO BE SET UP IN THE COURT AND ALSO A PINK STATUE OF HERSELF SO THAT THE RECORD OF ALL THE RULERS OF THE PINKIES SHOULD BE COMPLETE
IS IT GUARDED YES
THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THIS THEMSELVES NOR DID I SEE ANY FAIRIES IN MY VISION
AS FOR THE GROWN PEOPLE MANY OF THEM GOT OUT THEIR SHARP-POINTED STICKS TO USE AS WEAPONS IN CASE THE STRANGERS ATTACKED THEM OR BROKE AWAY FROM THEIR GUARDS
THIS CONFIDENCE IMPRESSED CAP'N BILL WHO SAID WITH A SIGH
IT WAS A BEWILDERING AND EXCITING RIDE BUT A DOZEN OF THE HUGE JUMPS ACCOMPLISHED THE JOURNEY AND AT THE EDGE OF FOG BANK EACH FROG STOPPED SO SUDDENLY THAT THE PINKIES WENT FLYING OVER THEIR HEADS TO TUMBLE INTO THE BLUE FIELDS OF THE BLUE COUNTRY WHERE THEY ROLLED IN A CONFUSED MASS UNTIL THEY COULD RECOVER AND SCRAMBLE TO THEIR FEET
AT LAST SHE RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID
SO WHENEVER THEY THROW THEM CORDS YOU MUS WARD EM OFF WITH YOUR LONG STICKS
BUTTON-BRIGHT PAID NO FURTHER ATTENTION TO THE HELPLESS ANIMAL BUT CAUGHT UP THE BLUE-BRASS LAMP AND BEGAN A SEARCH FOR HIS UMBRELLA
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SUNSET TRIBE CLAIMED THAT THE SUN ALWAYS DESERTED THE OTHER TRIBE AND CAME TO THEM WHICH WAS EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE
THIS FOG BANK IS THE PARADISE OF FROGS AND OUR KING IS ABOUT TEN TIMES AS BIG AS I AM THEN HE'S A BIG UN AN NO MISTAKE ADMITTED CAP'N BILL
THEN SHE SAID
ARE WE BUTTON-BRIGHT ILLUSTRATION I'M NOT SAID THE BOY
YES SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
DURING HIS ABSENCE THE PRISONERS HAD BEEN TALKING TOGETHER VERY EARNESTLY
GEE
A LITTLE WAY TO THE RIGHT THE WALL JOINED THE WALL OF THE CITY BEING ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH IT
PROBABLY NOT SAID THE CRAB
WHAT A WICKED THING TO DO WAILED THE PARROT
WE FLEW THERE BY MEANS OF A MAGIC UMBRELLA EXPLAINED BUTTON-BRIGHT
I MYSELF HAVE BEEN THE RIGHTFUL RULER OF THE BLUES SINCE THURSDAY AND YET THIS CRUEL AND DECEITFUL MAN HAS NOT ONLY DEPRIVED ME OF MY RIGHT TO SUCCEED HIM BUT HE HAS TRIED TO HAVE ME PATCHED SO THAT I COULD NEVER BECOME THE BOOLOOROO DOES THE BOOK TELL HOW OLD HE IS ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
I'LL BE SOAKED THROUGH IN A MINUTE SHE HAD BEEN GIVEN A COSTUME OF BLUE SILK IN EXCHANGE FOR HER OWN DRESS AND THE SILK WAS SO THIN THAT THE MOISTURE EASILY WETTED IT
PRODUCED BY CHUCK GREIF BROWARD COUNTY LIBRARIES AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET ILLUSTRATION
THE BOOLOOROO TELLS THEM WHOM TO VOTE FOR AND IF THEY DON'T OBEY THEY ARE SEVERELY PUNISHED
LET ME THINK A MOMENT SAID THE QUEEN RESTING HER CHIN ON HER HAND
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS IN THE LAND OF OZ OH CRIED TROT TURNING TO STARE AT THE BOY WITH BIG WIDE-OPEN EYES
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE TRIBULATION OF TROT CHAPTER 9
ONE EYE WAS HALF SHUT AND TWINKLING WHILE THE OTHER WAS BIG AND STARING
MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF THE EARTH PEOPLE THE PINKIES MADE NO OBJECTION WHATEVER TO UNDERTAKING THE ADVENTURE
WE'RE GOIN TO LIVE INSTEAD OF DIE IT'S TIME TO LAUGH INSTEAD OF CRY
THEY'D TEAR US TO PIECES IF THEY COULD SKY ISLAND WAS NOT A VERY BIG PLACE ESPECIALLY THE BLUE PART OF IT AND OUR FRIENDS WERE NOW VERY CLOSE TO THE LOW MOUNTAIN
BUT I'M FRAID THE GWIP--GRIP--GLIP GHIP-GHI-SIZ-ZLE REPEATED THE OFFICER SLOWLY
BEIN INVIS'BLE CAP'N I'M SAFE ENOUGH
ALSO IT IS FULL OF DAMPNESS THAT WETS YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR HAIR UNTIL YOU BECOME MISERABLE
YOU'VE ALL GOT TO OBEY ME FOR I'M THE BOOLOOROOESS--NO I MEAN THE BOSS--O THE BLUES AND I'VE A NOTION TO RUN THINGS MY OWN WAY YOU CAN'T SAID TURQUOISE SCORNFULLY
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO SEE YOU SAFE BACK WITH THE PINKIES AN THEN I'LL MANAGE TO HOLD MY OWN ALL RIGHT NEVER FEAR SO THEY BROUGHT A BLUE SHEET AND TIED ONE END TO A POST OF THE BLUE BED AND LET THE OTHER END DANGLE OUT THE BLUE WINDOW
I S'POSE I COULD FIGHT YOUR WHOLE CROWD O PINKIES IF I HAD TO AN MAKE YOU RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
CAN'T WE SHY YOUR TUT--TOR--MAR-LINE--OR WHATEVER YOU CALL HER--IN SOME WAY AN DEAL WITH YOU DIRECT NO
A FUZZY BLUE RABBIT WAS MAKING ALL THE NOISE
BUT NO ONE HAS EVER GONE INTO THE BLUE GROTTO UNTIL HIS ALLOTTED TIME WAS UP WELL I'M GOING TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO
I DON'T LIKE TO RISK IT FOR TROT'S MY CHUM AN I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE HER CAN'T YOU TIE US TOGETHER THEN ASKED THE BOY
BY AND BY CAP'N BILL UNCOVERED THE LUNCH BASKET AND PULLING ON THIS HE SOON DREW UP THE TWO SEATS AND FINALLY THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
I ESCAPED FROM THE CITY BECAUSE THE BOOLOOROO TRIED TO PATCH ME AS YOU ALL KNOW AND THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES TRIED TO MARRY ME WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A FAR GREATER MISFORTUNE
THE SOLDIERS ALL LAUGHED AT THIS QUESTION BUT THE KING DID NOT REPLY
LOOKING DOWNWARD CAP'N BILL SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED
SIX TIMES THE GOAT BUTTED AND EACH TIME HE TIPPED OVER A CHAIR AND SENT A HAUGHTY PRINCESS GROVELING UPON THE FLOOR WHERE THE LADIES GOT MIXED UP IN THEIR LONG BLUE TRAINS AND FLOUNCES AND LACES AND STRUGGLED WILDLY UNTIL THEY RECOVERED THEIR FOOTING
SHE IS WISE AND HONEST AND WILL DECIDE THE MATTER JUSTLY THE PINKIES SEEMED TO APPROVE THIS CHOICE SO TOURMALINE ROSE AND TOOK A SMALL PINK PAPER PARCEL FROM A DRAWER
I BEAR THESE STRANGERS NO ILL WILL NOR DO I BELIEVE THEY ARE IN ANY DANGER
AS ROSALIE WAS GREATLY LOVED AND RESPECTED THE PEOPLE JOYFULLY ACCEPTED HER AS THEIR QUEEN AND TROT ORDERED THEM TO TEAR DOWN THE OLD HUT AND BUILD A NEW PALACE FOR ROSALIE--ONE WHICH WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE CITY BUT NO BETTER
BUT IF I DON'T IT'S ALL UP TO YOU BUTTON-BRIGHT I'LL DO MY BEST HE PROMISED
THE BLUESKINS WERE NOT KEEPING A VERY CLOSE WATCH AS THEY WERE CONFIDENT THE PINKIES COULD NOT GET INTO THE CITY
I DIDN'T COME BY WATER TROT LAUGHED
SEEMS GOOD TO BE ON THE WAY HOME AGAIN REMARKED TROT AS THE UMBRELLA BUMPED INTO A BIG BLACK CLOUD
BUT CAP'N BILL SAID A FLOATING ISLAND IN THE SKY WAS SURE TO BE A FAIRYLAND I THINK SO YET MATE RETURNED THE SAILOR
DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
IT WAS REALLY A MAGNIFICENT SIGHT AND TROT SCARCELY BREATHED AS THE GREAT GOLDEN BALL SANK LOW IN THE SKY AND COLORED ALL THE CLOUDS WITH GORGEOUS TINTS OF ORANGE RED AND YELLOW
EACH OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES HELD THE END OF A RIBBON AND THEN THEY TURNED AND MARCHED HAUGHTILY AWAY TO THE PALACE DRAGGING THE LITTLE GIRL AFTER THEM
WHY COULDN'T THERE BE AN ISLAND IN THE SKY THAT WOULD BE NAMED SKY ISLAND OF COURSE NOT DECLARED CAP'N BILL
NOW THEN WHERE'LL WE GO ASKED TROT
IF ALLOWED TO REMAIN HERE THEY WOULD RUIN THE COLOR SCHEME OF THE COUNTRY WHERE ALL IS NOW PINK IN SPITE OF THAT SAID CORALIE THEY ARE HARMLESS CREATURES AND HAVE DONE US NO WRONG YES THEY HAVE REPLIED A NERVOUS LITTLE SUNRISE MAN
I DON'T EXPECT TO BE VERY CURIOUS A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW NOR I ADDED BUTTON-BRIGHT LAUGHING AT THE WHIMSICAL SPEECH
DOWN WHERE ASKED CAP'N BILL
SO CAP'N BILL UNHOOKED THE SEATS FROM THE HANDLE OF THE UMBRELLA AND WOUND THE ROPES AROUND THE TWO BOARDS AND MADE A PACKAGE OF THEM WHICH HE CARRIED UNDER HIS ARM
WHY I DON'T B'LIEVE HE KNOWS ABOUT IT SAID TROT
BUT THE BLUE CITY WAS NOW BEGINNING TO WAKEN TO LIFE
I'M QUEEN O THE PINKIES AN BOOLOOROOESS O THE BLUES AN WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE SAILOR
ALSO YOU ARE IGNORANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOTHING OF SKY ISLAND WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE ONLY PLACE ANYONE WOULD CARE TO LIVE DON'T LISTEN TO HIM TROT SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
CAN YOU REMEMBER IT I CAN MEMBER THE SIZZLE SAID THE BOY
OH BUTTON-BRIGHT CRIED THE LITTLE GIRL PRESENTLY
DOES IT EVER RAIN HERE INQUIRED BUTTON-BRIGHT
IT WAS A PINK COUNTRY INDEED
SO AFTER MARKING THE PLACE WHERE THE LADDER HUNG THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW HOW TO REACH IT AGAIN TROT HURRIED AWAY THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE LANDED IN A LARGE GARDEN SURROUNDED BY A HIGH WALL OF BLUE STONE
IT WAS PAVED WITH PINK MARBLE AND BETWEEN THE STREET AND THE HOUSES THAT LINED BOTH SIDES OF IT WERE GARDENS FILLED WITH PINK FLOWERS AND PINK GRASS LAWNS WHICH WERE SHADED BY PINK TREES AND SHRUBBERY
THE TYRANT WILL PERHAPS FIGHT ME AND MY CAUSE DESPERATELY BUT I AM SURE TO WIN IN THE END IF WE CAN HELP YOU SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT THE WHOLE PINK ARMY WILL FIGHT FOR YOU
NOW THEN COMMANDED PRINCESS INDIGO GO AND FEED MY LITTLE BLUE DOG THAT CROWS LIKE A ROOSTER AND FEED MY PRETTY BLUE CAT THAT SINGS LIKE A BIRD SAID PRINCESS AZURE
THEN THE SAILOR LET GO HIS HOLD AND THE KING STAGGERED TO A SEAT CHOKING AND COUGHING TO GET HIS BREATH BACK
WILL YOU MAKE TOURMALINE THE QUEEN AGAIN WHEN YOU GO AWAY I'LL SEND FOR HER AND SEE ABOUT IT REPLIED TROT
BUT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME GHIP THAT YOU'LL DESTROY THE GREAT KNIFE AND ITS FRAME AND CLEAN UP THE ROOM AND TURN IT INTO A SKATING-RINK AN NEVER PATCH ANYONE AS LONG AS YOU RULE THE BLUESKINS GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES BUT HE LOOKED SOLEMN AT THE PROMISE TROT EXACTED
ISN'T IT SURPRISING HOW LITTLE MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THEIR LAWS
DID YOU SEE CLEARLY SHE ASKED
WHAT ARGUMENTS HAVE THE OTHERS ADVANCED SHE ASKED
IT IS ONE OF MY WITCHCRAFT TREASURES AND I NEED IT IN MY BUSINESS THEN TROT CLIMBED THE LADDER ALTHOUGH NEITHER BUTTON-BRIGHT NOR ROSALIE COULD SEE HER DO SO AND WHEN SHE WAS ON TOP THE BROAD WALL SHE PULLED UP THE KNOTTED ROPES AND BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR A PLACE TO LET IT DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
CAP'N BILL SUSPECTED THAT THESE REMARKS WERE ADDRESSED TO HIM BUT HE COULDN'T MOVE JUST THEN BECAUSE THE SEAT WAS ACROSS HIM AND A BOY AND GIRL WERE SPRAWLING ON THE SEAT
THE PINKIES WERE REJOICED TO FIND THEMSELVES AGAIN IN THEIR BELOVED LAND OF SUNRISES AND SUNSETS
AS SOON AS HE WAS SAFE ON THE WALL CAP'N BILL BEGAN TO HOBBLE ALONG THE BROAD TOP TOWARD THE CONNECTING WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE ENTIRE CITY--JUST AS GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAD DONE--AND TROT ANXIOUSLY WATCHED HIM FROM THE WINDOW
DON'T LOSE THE RING FOR YOU MUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME WHEN YOU RETURN
HE NODDED CHEERFULLY THEN AND SAID
THEY SOON GAVE UP THE CHASE AND RETURNED TO THE CITY WHILE THE RUNAWAY MAJORDOMO WAS CAPTURED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND MARCHED AWAY TO THE TENT OF ROSALIE THE WITCH A PRISONER OF THE PINKIES
THE SIX PRINCESSES SAT DOWN IN A CIRCLE FACING THE CAPTIVES AND CERULIA SAID
AND YOU'VE BUMPED MY HEAD WITH YOUR BASKET AND SMASHED MY TOES WITH YOUR BOARDS AND BODIES WHICH IS A CRIME UNPARALLELED IN ALL THE HISTORY OF SKY ISLAND
HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ENJOY YOURSELVES
VIVE LA--VIVE LA--AH AH--TROT THANK YOU POLLY SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT GRATEFULLY
IT GIVES US THE BLUES--DON'T IT TROT?--SO AS SOON AS WE EAT A BITE O LUNCH FROM OUR BASKET WE'LL SAIL AWAY AGAIN SAIL AWAY
DON'T FORGET THE ROYAL NECKTIES URGED CAP'N BILL
BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST LOT OF WATER IN ALL THE WORLD HOW DO YOU KNOW CAP'N BILL TOLD ME SHE SAID
THEN THEY CAUGHT UP THEIR SHARP STICKS AND SURROUNDING THE DOOMED CAPTIVES COMMANDED THEM TO MARCH TO MEET THEIR FATE
I'VE HEARD OF THE EARTH MY CHILD BUT IT ISN'T INHABITED
THE MAJORDOMO SIMPLY DENIED TAKING THE RECORD BOOK AND THE BOOLOOROO DID NOT BELIEVE HE SPOKE TRULY
I'M ONLY MAJESTY SHE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING A DEEPER PINK
CLIMB UPON THEIR BACKS--AS MANY ON EACH FROG AS ARE ABLE TO HOLD ON--AND THEN WE SHALL MAKE THE JOURNEY MORE QUICKLY OBEYING THIS INJUNCTION THE PINKIES BEGAN CLIMBING UPON THE FROGS AND BY CROWDING CLOSE TOGETHER ALL WERE ABLE TO FIND PLACES
BUT SOME ARE ALL RIGHT AND--YOU SEEM TO BE ONE OF EM MUCH OBLIGED LAUGHED TROT
HE CAME ACROSS A SMALL BOOK BOUND IN LIGHT BLUE LEATHER WHICH LAY UPON AN EXQUISITELY CARVED CENTER-TABLE
THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL BROAD CORRIDORS AND THEN CAME TO A BIG HALL WHERE MANY SERVANTS WERE CONGREGATED
SOME IS GOOD AN SOME IS BAD AN IF ALL THE BLUESKINS ARE LIKE THEIR BOOLOOROO THEY CAN'T BE CALLED FUST-CLASS DON'T LET ME HEAR ANY MORE IMPUDENCE PRISONERS CALLED THE BOOLOOROO STERNLY
FOR-RERD--MARCH FOR-WARD--MARCH REPEATED CORALIE TO THE SUNSET TRIBE
WE MUST GET AWAY FROM HERE SOMEHOW R OTHER SAID CAP'N BILL
HE HUNTED IN EVERY CRACK AND CORNER TUMBLING THE TREASURES HERE AND THERE IN THE QUEST BUT AT LAST HE BECAME POSITIVE THAT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ROOM
WE'LL SEE
THE PINKIES WERE DESPONDENT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THEY HAD REPULSED THE ATTACK OF THE BLUES FOR AS YET THEY HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN GAINING THE CITY OR FINDING THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND THE BLUE DUSK OF THIS DREAD COUNTRY--WHICH WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THEIR OWN LAND OF SUNSETS--MADE THEM ALL VERY NERVOUS
YOU'RE SCARED STIFF SAID TROT
KEEP US TOGETHER YOUR MAJESTY BEGGED CAP'N BILL
OF COURSE SAID TROT
BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WANT THE PRIVILEGE OF PATCHING THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES TO EACH OTHER--MIXING THE SIX AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE--AND THEN I WANT TO PATCH THE FORMER BOOLOOROO TO THE BILLYGOAT WHICH IS THE SAME PUNISHMENT HE WAS GOING TO INFLICT UPON CAP'N BILL NO SAID TROT POSITIVELY THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH PATCHING IN THIS COUNTRY AND I WON'T HAVE ANY MORE OF IT
IT SEEMS LIKE IT AT FIRST REPLIED THE KING BUT I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ANY OF MY SUBJECTS GET NEAR THE END OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED THEY GROW NERVOUS AND SAY THE LIFE IS ALTOGETHER TOO SHORT HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
SO THE PROCESSION MOVED ALONG THE PRETTY ROADWAYS TO THE CITY WHICH THEY SOON REACHED
I KNOW SOME THINGS CAP'N BILL DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO YOU'RE PRETTY SMART SAID TROT
THE OTHER END HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS AND NOW THE RAINBOW BEGAN TO FADE GRADUALLY LIKE MIST AND THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHOT ITS CHEERING RAYS OVER THE PINK COUNTRY UNTIL PRESENTLY THE RAINBOW HAD VANISHED ALTOGETHER AND THE ONLY REMINDER OF IT WAS THE LOVELY POLYCHROME STANDING AMONG THE WONDERING BAND OF PINKIES
I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME FOR IT WOULD BE A BOTHER AN IF IT TRIED TO SPOUT PO'TRY I'D BE DISCOVERED IN A JIFFY AS THE BEAUTIFUL WITCH KISSED THE LITTLE GIRL GOOD-BYE SHE SLIPPED UPON HER FINGER A CURIOUS RING
I'M THE QUEEN OF SKY ISLAND YOU KNOW AND THE NEW BOOLOOROO HAS GOT TO CARRY OUT MY ORDERS AND TREAT YOU ALL NICELY WHILE I'M AWAY
THIS ENORMOUS CITY EXTENDS A HALF MILE IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE CENTER AND THE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE CITY IS FULLY A HALF MILE FURTHER IN EXTENT
HIS EYES WERE ALSO SKY-BLUE AND HIS HAIR WHICH WAS TRAINED STRAIGHT UP AND ENDED IN A CURL AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKEWISE BLUE IN COLOR AND MATCHED HIS SKIN AND HIS EYES
AFTER THE THREE TUMBLED UPON THE GRASS OF THE PINK COUNTRY THE VISION FADED AWAY AND ROSALIE LIFTED HER HEAD WITH A SMILE OF TRIUMPH AT THE SUCCESS OF HER WITCHCRAFT
THEY HAD BEEN QUARRELING BITTERLY AMONG THEMSELVES ALL THE MORNING AND STRANGELY ENOUGH THIS QUARREL WAS ALL ABOUT WHICH OF THEM SHOULD MARRY GHIP-GHISIZZLE
THE GUARDS SAW HIM TOO OUTLINED AGAINST THE SKY IN THE MOONLIGHT AND THEY BEGAN YELLING AT HIM TO STOP
AND WHILE THE THRONG SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THE QUEEN SUDDENLY THE GREAT RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE SKY AND DROPPED ITS END RIGHT ON THE COURT OF THE STATUES
MAKE THE WHITESKINS TELL YOU SO THAT I CAN USE IT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT I'LL DO MY BEST YOUR MAJESTY SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN UMBRELLA IN MY KINGDOM BEFORE AND I'LL NOT ALLOW ONE IN IT NOW
HELLO POLLY
THAT LITTLE CABIN EXCLAIMED TROT
OTHERWISE NONE OF US CAN EVER BE THE QUEEN THIS BEING EVIDENT THEY PROCEEDED TO UNBIND THE LONG LEGS OF GHIP-GHISIZZLE LEAVING HIS BODY AND ARMS HOWEVER TIED FAST TOGETHER
THE DOGGIE HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE KNOWN ANYONE SO KIND AND GENTLE SO WHEN TROT WENT INTO THE NEXT BOUDOIR THE ANIMAL FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HER HEELS WAGGING HIS TAIL EVERY MINUTE
HE MIGHT HAVE HIT SOME ONE ON THE EARTH GUESS HE SKIPPED IT THOUGH ADDED CAP'N BILL FOR I NEVER HEARD OF A PINKY TILL I CAME HERE AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE EARTH RETORTED CORALIE
QUEEN TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON-BRIGHT SAW THE VISION TOO FOR THEY WERE ALL IN THE TENT TOGETHER AND THE SIGHT MADE THEM ANXIOUS
BUT NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE NOISY BIRD
THE BOOLOOROO HAS HIDDEN HIM UNTIL TO-MORROW MORNING WHEN HE'S TO BE PATCHED TO ME
THEN HE TURNED TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AND ADDED
THE PRINCESSES WERE HORRIFIED TO FIND INDIGO SO SCRATCHED AND BITTEN AND THEY WERE LIKEWISE AMAZED AT THE REBELLION OF THEIR SIX PETS WHICH THEY HAD NEVER PETTED INDEED BUT KEPT IN THEIR BOUDOIRS SO THEY COULD ABUSE THEM WHENEVER THEY FELT ESPECIALLY WICKED OR ILL-NATURED
COBALT BEGAN TO SAY
VILLAINS HOWLED THE BOOLOOROO
YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR
SO SHE OPENED THE BASKET AND THEY ALL THREE SAT IN A ROW ON A STONE BENCH AND BEGAN TO EAT SANDWICHES AND CAKE AND PICKLES AND CHEESE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE PACKED IN THE LUNCH BASKET
TROT LONGED TO SEE MORE OF THE STRANGE BLUE ISLAND AND ESPECIALLY WANTED TO EXPLORE THE MAGNIFICENT BLUE PALACE THAT ADJOINED THE GARDEN AND WHICH HAD SIX HUNDRED TALL TOWERS AND TURRETS
I TOLD YOU TO LET THINGS ALONE GROWLED CAP'N BILL
BUT WHY I CAN'T SAY
AIN'T THIS A PIE CAP'N BILL LET THE BIRD JABBER AS HE PLEASED FOR THE OCCASION WAS A JOYFUL ONE AND IT WAS NO WONDER THE PARROT WAS EXCITED
HE WORE A BLOUSE WAIST A SHORT JACKET AND KNICKERBOCKERS
CAP'N BILL'S ROOM HAD A SMALL DOOR LEADING OUT INTO THE STREET OF THE CITY BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE ADVISED HIM TO KEEP THIS DOOR LOCKED AS THE CITY PEOPLE WOULD BE SURE TO HURT THE STRANGERS IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO ATTACK THEM
BUT IF WE DO WE CAN TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES WITHOUT MAGIC VERY WELL REPLIED ROSALIE
GOOD CRIED TROT
BUT HE STILL SEEMED TO DOUBT THEM
THE WOODEN LEG WON'T BOTHER MUCH HE ASSURED HER
I'M RETURNING HIS MAJESTY'S SHOES SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT HELD FAST TO THE ROPES AND WERE CARRIED ALONG VERY EASILY AND COMFORTABLY
SO WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE YOU TO TOURMALINE AND LET HER DECIDE WHAT SHALL BE YOUR FATE WHO IS TOURMALINE INQUIRED TROT DOUBTFULLY FOR SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING TAKEN TO ANYONE
WHERE DID YOU GET IT THE QUEEN OF THE MERMAIDS GAVE IT TO ME ANSWERED TROT
HE FASTENED IT SO IT WOULD SWING UNDERNEATH HIS OWN SEAT AND THEN THEY ALL TOOK THEIR PLACES AGAIN
THEREFORE IN ORDER TO DECIDE YOUR FATE I HAVE SUMMONED A COUNCIL OF TWELVE OF MY PEOPLE WHO WILL VOTE AS TO WHETHER YOU SHALL BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN HERE OR NOT
I'M SURE GHIP-GHISIZZLE WILL SIDE WITH US AND I'VE GOT THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK WHICH PROVES THAT THE BOOLOOROO HAS ALREADY REIGNED HIS LAWFUL THREE HUNDRED YEARS DOES THE BOOK SAY THAT INQUIRED TROT WITH INTEREST
I'VE FLOWN HERE ALL ALONE
FOR THE PINKIES WERE ROUND AND CHUBBY--ALMOST LIKE APPLE-DUMPLINGS AS THE PARROT HAD CALLED THEM--AND THEY WERE NOT VERY TALL THE HIGHEST OF THE MEN BEING NO TALLER THAN TROT OR BUTTON-BRIGHT
BUT THE LIGHT O CIVILIZATION HAS SKEERED IT AWAY LONG AGO AN MAGIC'S BEEN A LOST ART SINCE LONG AFORE YOU AN I WAS BORN TROT I KNOW THAT FAIRIES STILL LIVE SAID TROT REFLECTIVELY
THE FAIRIES WHO CONTROL BUTTON-BRIGHT'S UMBRELLA MUST BE VERY POWERFUL INDEED ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION TROT REGULATES THE PINKIES CHAPTER 29
WHILE THEY WERE SITTING AND TALKING TOGETHER THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS ENTERED AND BOWED RESPECTFULLY
WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL
OH MY
THE BLUES DID NOT ESPECIALLY ADMIRE THE PINKIES BUT IT WAS EASIER TO ENTERTAIN THEM THAN TO FIGHT THEM AND ABOVE ALL THE BLUESKINS WERE GREATLY REJOICED THAT THEIR WICKED BOOLOOROO HAD BEEN CONQUERED AND COULD NO LONGER ABUSE THEM
HAVING HEARD OF THE OLD BOOLOOROO'S DOWNFALL AND DISGRACE THE MAN CONSENTED TO GO TO THE PALACE AGAIN AND AS SOON AS TROT SAW HIM SHE ASKED ABOUT THE UMBRELLA
WE'LL JUS HAVE TO STICK IT OUT TILL WE GET TO THE OTHER SIDE HAD WE BETTER GO TO THE OTHER SIDE ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT ANXIOUSLY
I'LL GIVE HIM TO ROSALIE FOR I'M SURE SHE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM ROSALIE ACCEPTED THE GIFT WITH PLEASURE BUT THE PARROT LOOKED SOBER AWHILE AND THEN SAID
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT LAW ROSALIE IT'S A GOOD LAW AND A JUST ONE REPLIED THE WITCH APPROVINGLY
YOU DON'T BLACK THE ROYAL BOOTS AND SHOES
IF YOU HAD YOUR MAGIC UMBRELLA COULD YOU FLY HOME AGAIN IN SAFETY OF COURSE WE COULD REPLIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
IT IS AN INSINUATION THAT YOU DON'T LIKE OUR GLORIOUS CLIMATE AND OBJECT TO OUR DELIGHTFUL FOG AND ARE TRYING TO WARD OFF ITS SOULFUL CLINGING KISSES REPLIED THE FROG KING IN AN AGITATED VOICE
TELL ME CAPTAIN HAVE YOU SUCH A THING AS A BRASS BAND IN THIS CITY WE HAVE TWO FINE BANDS BUT THEY ARE NOT BRASS REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
BUT HOW DID THEY GET TO SKY ISLAND INQUIRED THE THIRD SNUBNOSED ONE
HAVEN'T YOU ANY FAIRIES HERE OH THERE ARE FAIRIES OF COURSE AS THERE ARE EVERYWHERE ANSWERED TOURMALINE
HERE'S A RIDDLE FOR US TO GUESS TROT
WHY NOT WAIT UNTIL THIS SHOWER IS OVER I HAVE SAID AT ONCE REPLIED THE LITTLE QUEEN WITH DIGNITY AND SO IT MUST BE AT ONCE
AN COME AN SEE ME AGAIN AS QUICK AS YOU CAN ILLUSTRATION I'LL TRY TO COME AGAIN SAID THE BOY
THIS IS ABOUT THE MEANEST BOOLOOROO WHO EVER RULED THIS LAND AND HE WAS THE FIRST TO INVENT PATCHING PEOPLE AS A PUNISHMENT
WHY SEE HOW BIG THEY ARE
BUT THERE WAS NO LION THERE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEY KNOW WE CAN'T GET AWAY OBSERVED THE SAILOR SO THEY DON'T NEED TO WATCH US WE COULD GO INTO THE FOG BANK AGAIN SUGGESTED TROT
ONLY A FEW PLACES ARE FENCED WAS THE REPLY
IT OUGHT NOT TO BE HARD WORK TO BREAK INTO THE TREASURE CHAMBER
THE LAMB RAN UP AND BUTTED INDIGO SO THAT SHE STUMBLED FORWARD ON HER FACE WHEN THE PEACOCK PROCEEDED TO POUND HER HEAD WITH HIS WINGS
WHEN GHIP-GHISIZZLE RETURNED HE SAID
THESE FLASHES PERMITTED SOME OF THE PRINCESSES TO SEE HER AND AT ONCE THEY RUSHED TOWARD HER WITH FURIOUS CRIES
DON'T WE LOOK FUNNY SAID TROT WITH A CHUCKLE OF GLEE
AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND CAPTAIN TINTINT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH
MEANTIME TROT BEING INVISIBLE TO ALL WAS ROAMING AROUND THE ROOM AND BEHIND A BENCH SHE FOUND A SMALL COIL OF ROPE WHICH SHE PICKED UP
SO HE LICKED TROT'S HAND AND WAGGED HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL AND THEN STRAIGHTENED UP AND CROWED LIKE A ROOSTER
THOSE PINK CREATURES HAVE NO BLUE BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS AND THEY'LL RUN LIKE RABBITS WHEN THEY SEE US COMING THEN HE ORDERED THE GATE THROWN OPEN AND IMMEDIATELY THE BLUESKINS POURED OUT INTO THE OPEN PLAIN AND BEGAN TO RUN TOWARD THE PINKIES
THEY COULD NOT GO VERY FAST BECAUSE THE SAILORMAN'S WOODEN LEG WAS AWKWARD TO RUN WITH AND HELD THEM BACK BUT CAP'N BILL HOBBLED QUICKER THAN HE HAD EVER HOBBLED BEFORE IN ALL HIS LIFE AND THEY REALLY MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS
HE'S A QUEER LOOKING CHAP WITH HIS PALE YELLOW SKIN AND I IMAGINE OUR CRUEL BOOLOOROO IS LIKELY TO PATCH HIM BEFORE LONG AS HE DID ME--I MEAN US NO HE WON'T SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT POSITIVELY
I'VE BEEN READING IT THEN SIZZLE'LL BE THE NEW BOOLOOROO SAID THE GIRL AN P'RAPS WE WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT AFTER ALL WE'D BETTER GO PREPARED THOUGH ADVISED CAP'N BILL FER THAT AWFUL OL BOOLOOROO WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
O LIZ--YOU PUFFY LIZ GET OUT OF OUR WAY AND MIND YOUR BIZ CRIED THE PARROT
FIRST SHE RAN WITH HER ROPE TO THE GOAT AND AS THE ANIMAL COULD NOT SEE HER SHE EASILY SUCCEEDED IN TYING THE ROPE AROUND ITS HORNS AND FASTENING THE LOOSE END TO A PILLAR OF THE DOORWAY
I CAN'T SEE ANY MORE OF IT THAN I CAN OF THE ATLANTIC YOU'D FIND OUT IF YOU HAD TO SAIL ACROSS IT SHE DECLARED
ALL THE BLUESKINS ASSEMBLED IN THE SERVANTS HALL WERE AMAZED TO SEE THE PETS OF THE PRINCESSES TRAILING AFTER THE STRANGE LITTLE GIRL BUT TROT TOOK HER PLACE NEXT TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AT THE TABLE AND THE PARROT PERCHED UPON HER SHOULDER WHILE THE PEACOCK STOOD UPON ONE SIDE OF HER CHAIR AND THE LAMB UPON THE OTHER AND THE CAT AND DOG LAY AT HER FEET AND THE BLUE RABBIT CLIMBED INTO HER LAP AND CUDDLED DOWN THERE
CAP'N BILL MAY KNOW MORE'N I DO--A GOOD DEAL MORE--BUT I'M SURE HE CAN'T KNOW THE SAME THINGS
THE BOOLOOROO KEEPS IT IN HIS POCKET NIGHT AND DAY WAS THE REPLY
OH THERE'S CAP'N BILL
WALKING AROUND THE LIZARD THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY AND SOON CAME TO THE FROG BEING GUIDED BY ITS GRUNTS AND CROAKS
BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE KEPT RIGHT ON UNTIL HE REACHED THE CITY WALL WHEN HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THAT
I'LL DO IT
MOTHER WANTED SOME YARN FROM THE STORE
BUT SEEMS TO ME THE BES PART OF ALL WAS GETT'N HOME AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL DAYS TROT RECEIVED A POSTAL-CARD FROM BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEN HE RAISED THE BLUESKIN IN THE AIR AND THREW HIM FAR OVER THE WALL
NO ONE CAN RESIST THE MIGHTY BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES SO IT IS FOLLY FOR YOU TO REBEL AGAINST MY COMMANDS
THE LAW DOES NOT SAY PINKIES IT SAYS ANY WHO ARE IN THE PINK COUNTRY TRUE AGREED CORALIE GREATLY PLEASED AND ALL THE OTHER PINKIES NODDED THEIR HEADS AND REPEATED
THE OLD BOOLOOROO AND THE SIX STUCK-UP PRINCESSES WILL BE PUNISHED ENOUGH BY BEING PUT OUT OF THE PALACE
BUT HERE SHE ADDED FOR SHE HAD STILL CONTINUED TO TURN THE LEAVES OF THE GREAT BOOK IS ANOTHER LAW WHICH YOU HAVE ALSO OVERLOOKED
WE'VE GOT THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK AN IT PROVES YOU'VE ALREADY RULED THIS COUNTRY LONGER THAN YOU HAD ANY RIGHT TO
JUDGING FROM THEIR ACTIONS IN THE PAST THERE IS NO BEST ROSALIE THE WITCH NOW WENT TO THE CABIN AND PUT INDIGO INTO A DEEP SLEEP BY MEANS OF A POWERFUL CHARM
MAKE GHIP-GHISIZZLE MARRY ME AND I'LL TELL YOU REPEATED INDIGO
IT WAS ALL A QUESTION OF SOCIAL IMPORTANCE
THE KING JUMPED FIRST OF ALL AND IN A PANIC OF FEAR THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE
THEN THEY SAW THAT THE SAILOR WAS FREE AND THE BOOLOOROO BOUND IN HIS PLACE
TO BE EXACT I SHOULD CALL THE SKIN OF THE GIRL AND THAT OF THE BOY A MUDDY PINK RATHER FADED WHILE THE SKIN OF THE GIGANTIC MONSTER WITH THEM IS AN UNPLEASANT BROWN CAP'N BILL LOOKED CROSS FOR A MINUTE FOR HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE CALLED A GIGANTIC MONSTER ALTHOUGH HE REALIZED HE WAS MUCH LARGER THAN THE PINK PEOPLE
WE MUST HURRY OR WE MAY GET WET HAVEN'T YOU ANY UMBRELLAS ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
I EVEN DECREE DEATH WHEN SUCH A PUNISHMENT IS MERITED
THEY HAVE SHARP STICKS AN KNOW HOW TO USE EM WHEREAS THE BLUESKINS HAVE ONLY THEM WINDIN'-UP CORDS WITH WEIGHTS ON THE ENDS THE BLUESKINS ARE THE BIGGEST PEOPLE SAID THE GIRL
SO NOW GOOD-BYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE SCREAMED THE SIX SNUBNOSED GIRLS WHO HAD ONCE BEEN PRINCESSES AND WHO WERE NOW IN THE CROWD THAT WATCHED THE DEPARTURE
FAIRIES OF THE SKY
THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THE JUDGMENT OF SOME OF MY COUNSELORS IS WRONG AND THE JUDGMENT OF OTHERS RIGHT
BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID ANOTHER PRINCESS
I WILL TAKE YOUR ADVICE CAP'N AND ENCHANT THE WEAPONS OF THE PINKIES SHE THEN WENT OUT AND HAD ALL THE PINKIES COME BEFORE HER ONE BY ONE AND SHE ENCHANTED THEIR SHARP STICKS BY MUTTERING SOME CABALISTIC WORDS AND MAKING QUEER PASSES WITH HER HANDS OVER THE WEAPONS
BUT FINALLY HE RECOVERED AND GOT UPON HIS FEET DELIGHTED TO FIND HE HAD BROKEN NONE OF HIS BONES
NEVER MIND IF THEY DO SLICE THE BOOLOOROO
I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEIN BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUS ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELIN'S SHIVER ALL YOU WANT TO CAP'N SHE SAID AS SHE REMOVED THE LAST BONDS
WHO'S CAP'N BILL AN OLD SAILORMAN WHO'S A FRIEND OF MINE
HE'S USED TO IT YOU KNOW WHISPERED TROT TO HER NEW FRIEND
OH YOU DARLING CRIED TROT HUGGING THE LITTLE LAMB TIGHT IN HER ARMS
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE KING'S APARTMENTS THERE WAS ANOTHER GUARD BEFORE THE DOOR THIS TIME A LONG-NECKED SOLDIER WITH A TERRIBLE SCOWL
ALL THE RUBBISH WAS PILED IN THE SQUARE BEFORE THE PALACE AND A BONFIRE MADE OF IT WHILE THE BLUE PEOPLE CLUSTERED AROUND AND DANCED AND SANG WITH JOY AS THE BLUE FLAMES DEVOURED THE DREADFUL INSTRUMENT THAT HAD ONCE CAUSED THEM SO MUCH UNHAPPINESS
BUT IT'S THERE ALL RIGHT AND IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO LIVE
BUT SKY ISLAND IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE SEA THAT THE RING WON'T DO ME ANY GOOD WHILE I'M HERE
NOW WHEN THE BOOLOOROO LOOKED THROUGH THE BLUE-STEEL BARS OF THE MAIN GATE AND SAW THE ENEMY ARMED WITH SHARP-POINTED STICKS HE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS ON HIS FEET IN AN INSTANT
SHUT IT OFF OR FEAR MY WRATH WE CAN'T LAUGHED TROT
ACCORDING TO OUR FIGURES THE BOOLOOROO OUGHT TO MARCH INTO THIS GROTTO A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NEXT THURSDAY BUT HE IS TRYING TO STEAL A HUNDRED YEARS AND SO PERHAPS HE WON'T ENTER THE ARCH OF PHINIS
THEY WALKED ALONG MORE SLOWLY NOW STILL KEEPING HOLD OF HANDS
BUT I GUESS IT'S SURELY AN ISLAND TROT AN BEIN AS IT'S IN THE SKY IT'S LIKELY TO BE SKY ISLAND THEN WE SHALL LAND THERE SAID THE BOY CONFIDENTLY
AND INDEED CAP'N BILL TOOK IT ALL CHEERFULLY AND NEVER MINDED A BIT
THAT IS A COUNTRY WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF
THE ROYAL PALACE WAS CERTAINLY A MAGNIFICENT BUILDING WITH LARGE AND LOFTY ROOMS AND SUPERB FURNISHINGS ALL BEING IN SHADES OF BLUE
ALL PRESENT REALIZED THAT THIS WAS A DECREE OF DEATH TO THE STRANGERS
SUPPOSE IT'S A FRIEND HE SUGGESTED
WHEN IT'S A CASE OF LIFE N DEATH CLO'S DON'T COUNT FOR MUCH
IF IT AIN'T KEERFUL THE OL THING WILL PASS WAY BY THE ISLAND I--I'M SURE IT HAS PASSED IT ALREADY EXCLAIMED TROT WHAT'S WRONG BUTTON-BRIGHT
WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE BOOLOOROO WON'T PATCH CAP'N BILL FOR THREE DAYS WHEN NIGHT SETTLED DOWN UPON THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES WHERE MANY TENTS HAD NOW BEEN PITCHED ALL THE INVADERS WERE FILLED WITH GLOOM
FROM THE EARTH REPLIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
BUT I DIDN'T GET IT
BUT THE BLAMED OL BOOL'ROO'S SURE TO FIND SOME ONE ELSE
BUT IF YOU WILL CLIMB UPON MY BACK I THINK I CAN CARRY YOU TO THE BORDER IN ONE MORE LEAP I'M TIRED SAID TROT AN THIS AWFUL FOG'S BEGINNIN TO CHOKE ME
BLUE FEATHERS DON'T MAKE BLUEBIRDS REALLY SAID THE LITTLE GIRL STANDING UP AND BOWING RESPECTFULLY TO THE PINKIES WE ARE NOT BLUESKINS ALTHOUGH WE ARE WEARING THE BLUE UNIFORMS OF THE BOOLOOROO AND HAVE JUST ESCAPED FROM THE BLUE COUNTRY
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE ARRIVAL OF POLYCHROME CHAPTER 17
HER SKIN AND HAIR AND EYES WERE ALL OF A ROSY PINK COLOR AND HER GOWN WAS OF SPIDER-WEB GAUZE THAT NICELY MATCHED HER COMPLEXION
BUT I DIDN'T GET THAT EITHER
AT ONCE BUTTON-BRIGHT AROUSED CORALIE WHO GOT HER PINKIES TOGETHER AND QUICKLY MARCHED THEM TOWARD THE WALL TO ASSIST IN THE ESCAPE OF HER COMMANDER IN CHIEF
SHE'S CROSS
AN YOU MUS TAKE CAP'N BILL FOR AN AIR-RIDE TOO OH TROT
IT REELY DOES MATE ANSWERED THE SAILORMAN JOYOUSLY
NO ONE WAS HURT HOWEVER AND THE KING FROG HAD BEEN WISE ENOUGH TO TREAT HIS PASSENGERS MORE GENTLY BY SLOWING DOWN AT THE EDGE AND ALLOWING HIS RIDERS TO SLIP TO THE GROUND VERY COMFORTABLY
WHAT SHALL I CALL HER THEN INQUIRED CAP'N BILL
A LOW FIERCE GROWL GREETED HIM
IF THERE COULD BE AN ISLAND UP HERE AMONG THE CLOUDS I'D THINK IT WAS THERE WE'RE GOING COULDN'T THERE BE ONE ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
THE BLUES WERE IN SUCH A FRIGHTENED CONFUSED MASS THAT THEY GOT IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAY AND COULD NOT MAKE VERY GOOD PROGRESS ON THE RETREAT SO THE OLD SAILOR SOON CAUGHT UP WITH THEM AND BEGAN JABBING AT THE CROWD WITH HIS STICK
HERE IN SKY ISLAND WE PRIZE TRUTHFULNESS VERY HIGHLY
IT'S TOO FAR TO SAIL OR ROW AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT THAT ISLAND WHAT'S THE NAME OF IT INQUIRED BUTTON-BRIGHT WHILE THE SAILOR HESITATED HOW TO DECIDE
WHERE IN THE SKY DID YOU COME FROM THEN AND WHERE IS YOUR COUNTRY LOCATED WE LIVE ON THE EARTH WHEN WE'RE AT HOME REPLIED THE GIRL
HE SECRETLY BELIEVED THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD TAKEN THE BOOK FROM THE TREASURE CHAMBER AND IF THIS WERE TRUE IT MIGHT PROVE AS GREAT A MISFORTUNE AS IF THE KING HAD KEPT IT LOCKED UP
LARGER AND LARGER GREW THE ISLAND AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARD IT THE UMBRELLA SEEMED TO RISE HIGHER AND HIGHER INTO THE AIR THE FARTHER IT TRAVELED
IF YOU CHOOSE ME I'LL SCRATCH YOUR EYES OUT IF YOU CHOOSE ME SAID COBALT IN A RAGE I'LL TEAR OUT YOUR HAIR BY THE ROOTS IF I AM TO BE YOUR WIFE SCREAMED AZURE
THESE MEN SEEMED TO BE SOLDIERS ALTHOUGH THEY BORE NO ARMS EXCEPT THE CORDS
YOU'D BETTER SAVE YOUR CITY FIRST AND DO YOUR PATCHING AFTERWARD WHAT ROARED THE BOOLOOROO DARE YOU DICTATE TO ME BUT HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE MAN'S LOGIC
THE TWELVE COUNSELORS THEN VOTED AND WHEN THE VOTE WAS COUNTED TOURMALINE ANNOUNCED THAT SIX HAD VOTED TO ALLOW THE STRANGERS TO REMAIN AND SIX TO TOSS THEM OVER THE BUSHES
THE LONG TRUNK OF THE ELEPHANT WAS CURVED TO MAKE A CROOK FOR THE HANDLE
DOESN'T THE SUN EVER SHINE ASKED CAP'N BILL
GLORY ME EXCLAIMED THE GIRL CLAPPING HER HANDS IN ECSTACY
TROT WAS OCCUPYING INDIGO'S ROOM SO THAT PRINCESS WAS OBLIGED TO DRESS WITH AZURE NOT DARING TO ENTER HER OWN CHAMBER AND THE TWO SISTERS QUARRELLED SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THEY ALMOST CAME TO BLOWS BEFORE THEY WERE READY FOR DINNER
GO AT ONCE YOU DUMMIES AND FIND HIM--OR IT WILL GO HARD WITH YOU THE FRIGHTENED SOLDIERS HURRIED AWAY TO FIND TIGGLE AND TROT WAS WELL PLEASED BECAUSE SHE KNEW TIGGLE WAS BY THIS TIME SAFELY HIDDEN
HE PASSED THE LONG-NECKED GUARD AGAIN FINDING THE MAN HALF ASLEEP AND THEN MADE HIS WAY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER
IF WE'RE TO BE SLAVES DON'T SEPARATE US BUT MAKE US ALL THE SAME KIND O SLAVES I SHALL DO WHAT PLEASES ME DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO ANGRILY
THE WICKED BOOLOOROO HAD ALREADY REIGNED OVER THE BLUE COUNTRY THREE HUNDRED YEARS LAST THURSDAY SO THAT NOW HE HAS NO RIGHT TO RULE AT ALL
ITS COVERING HAD ONCE BEEN OF THICK BROWN CLOTH BUT THE COLOR HAD FADED TO A DULL DRAB EXCEPT IN THE CREASES AND TROT THOUGHT IT LOOKED VERY OLD-FASHIONED AND COMMON
THEN WHEN EVERYBODY WAS READY THEY ENTERED THE FOG AND ROSALIE THE WITCH MADE A SIGNAL TO CALL THE FROG KING AND HIS SUBJECTS TO AID THEM AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE
YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW EASY IT IS TO FLY THAT WAY--AFTER YOU GET USED TO IT BUT TROT AIN'T USED TO IT OBJECTED THE SAILOR
TROT QUICKLY BRIGHTENED AT THIS PROMISE ALTHOUGH CAP'N BILL LOOKED GRAVE AND SHOOK HIS HEAD SOLEMNLY
I'VE HAD CONSID'BLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AND I'M ALL READY FOR BREAKFAS VERY WELL REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO YOU SHALL EAT WITH ME FOR THEN I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU
EITHER PERMIT YOU TO REMAIN HERE AS HONORED GUESTS OR TAKE YOU TO AN EDGE OF THE ISLAND AND THROW YOU OVER THE BUSHES INTO THE SKY THEY WERE SILENT AT HEARING THIS DREADFUL ALTERNATIVE BUT THE PARROT SCREAMED SHRILLY
IN THAT CASE I'LL MAKE YOU THE QUEEN ROSALIE FOR YOU'VE GOT MORE SENSE THAN TOURMALINE HAS AND YOUR POWERS AS A WITCH WILL HELP YOU TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AT ONCE SHE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING THE ASSEMBLED PINKIES THAT BY VIRTUE OF HER HIGH OFFICE AS QUEEN OF SKY ISLAND SHE WOULD LEAVE ROSALIE THE WITCH TO RULE OVER THE PINK COUNTRY WHILE SHE RETURNED TO THE EARTH WITH HER FRIENDS
BUT JUST THEN IN CAME THE SOLDIERS TO SAY THAT TIGGLE COULD NOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE CITY
THE PINKIES ARE PINK THE BLUES ARE BLUE BUT TROT'S THE QUEEN SO TOO-RAL-LOO WHEN THE BLUESKINS SAW GHIP-GHISIZZLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
REALLY LADIES YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
YOU HAD TO GET UP IN THE AIR BEFORE YOU COULD DROP DOWN AN'--OH CAP'N BILL
ALL BUT ONE WAS THE REPLY
I AM TO TAKE YOU TO TOURMALINE WHO HAS PROMISED TO DECIDE YOUR FATE THIS MORNING
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THIS HOUR HE DEMANDED
IT SEEMED SCARCELY A MINUTE BEFORE THEY WERE IN THE TOWN AND WHEN THE UMBRELLA SET THEM DOWN JUST IN FRONT OF THE STORE--FOR IT SEEMED TO KNOW JUST WHERE THEY WANTED TO GO--A WONDERING CROWD GATHERED AROUND THEM
THEY HAD EARLY BREAKFASTS AT TROT'S HOUSE BECAUSE THEY ALL WENT TO BED EARLY AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO SLEEP ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS IF ONE IS HEALTHY IN BODY AND MIND
BUTTON-BRIGHT CAUTIOUSLY PICKED IT UP AND AS HE EXAMINED IT HE THOUGHT THE TINY RED EYES STILL TWINKLED A LITTLE AS IF WITH TRIUMPH AND PRIDE
THE QUEEN IS THE POOREST AND MOST MISERABLE CREATURE IN ALL THE KINGDOM AND I'M SURE I DON'T DESERVE SUCH A FATE
FRANK BAUM
FRANK BAUM
FRANK BAUM
IT GIVES SOME ONE ELSE A CHANCE TO RULE AN I WOULDN'T BE S'PRISED IF THE NEXT KING IS A BETTER ONE
UNFORTUNATELY THE PINKIES HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEIR COMMANDER BEING FOR THE MOMENT DAZED BY THEIR SUCCESS SO THAT CAP'N BILL WAS ALL ALONE AMONG THE BLUESKINS WHEN HE STEPPED HIS WOODEN LEG INTO A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND TUMBLED FULL LENGTH HIS SHARP STICK FLYING FROM HIS HAND AND PRICKING THE BOOLOOROO IN THE LEG AS IT FELL
THE PEOPLE AGREED TO DO ALL THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SOME OF THE LEADERS WHISPERED TOGETHER AND THEN ASKED CORALIE TO BE THEIR SPOKESMAN IN REPLYING TO QUEEN TROT'S SPEECH
CAP'N BILL SAT UP AND RUBBED HIS EYES
BUT NOW THE FROWN DIED AWAY FROM HIS FACE AND WAS REPLACED BY A LOOK OF SATISFACTION
IF YOU CAN DO THAT I WILL BE THE BEST AND MOST GRATEFUL FRIEND YOU EVER HAD I'LL SEE SAID THE BOY
THERE'S LAND BELOW US THE BOY AND GIRL LEANED OVER AND TRIED TO SEE THIS LAND BUT CAP'N BILL WAS ALSO LEANING OVER AND HIS BIG BODY HID ALL THAT WAS JUST UNDERNEATH THEM
THE EARTH
THE EARTH
THEREFORE WHEN TROT RATTLED AT THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM GHIP-GHISIZZLE RAN AND SEATED HIMSELF UPON THE WINDOW-SILL DANGLING HIS LONG LEGS OVER THE EDGE
WHY IT'S THE TRUTH REPLIED TROT
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THE UMBRELLA SWEPT STEADILY ALONG GETTING FARTHER AND FARTHER OUT TO SEA AND RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER TOWARD THE CLOUDS
YOU MERELY BLUE THEM WITH A FINELY PERFUMED BLUE PASTE
SOLID LAND'S PRETTY GOOD TO HOLD ON TO DECIDED CAP'N BILL
SHE SAID I COULDN'T GO TO UNCLE BOB'S BECAUSE I HAD NO UMBRELLA
TROT HAD TOLD HIM WHERE TO FIND THE ROPE LADDER SHE HAD LEFT AND HOW TO FASTEN IT TO THE BROKEN FLAGSTAFF SO HE COULD CLIMB DOWN INTO THE FIELD OUTSIDE THE CITY
NOT VERY WELL THE BOY REPLIED
THAT IS UTTER NONSENSE DECLARED POLYCHROME IMPATIENTLY
CAP'N BILL MIGHT EASILY DO THE SAME
BUT--GOOD GRACIOUS ME
THEY CARRIED US BEFORE AS A FAVOR BUT IF THE KING NOW INSISTS THAT WE CANNOT PASS WITH THE UMBRELLA WE MUST GO BACK TO THE BLUE COUNTRY OR LEAVE YOUR UMBRELLA BEHIND US WE WON'T DO THAT SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT INDIGNANTLY
TAKE HIM TO THE SERVANTS QUARTERS CAPTAIN ULTRAMARINE AND GIVE HIM A SUIT OF THE ROYAL LIVERY SO CAP'N BILL WAS LED AWAY BY THE CHIEF OF THE SOLDIERS AND WHEN HE HAD GONE THE KING SAID TO BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEY ALL ENJOYED A HEARTY MEAL AND AFTERWARD SAT AND TALKED OVER THEIR ADVENTURES
GET OFF AT ONCE ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES CHAPTER 5
BUT HE LOOKED AT THEM SLEEPILY AND DID NOT SEEM AT ALL DANGEROUS
THIS BEING THE CASE I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO INJURE THESE FAVORED PEOPLE IN ANY WAY
TROT WASN'T VERY BIG HERSELF BUT THE BOY WAS NOT QUITE AS BIG AS TROT
IT CAN'T BE HELPED REPLIED ROSALIE
SO THEY ALWAYS CALL ME BUTTON-BRIGHT WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME SHE INQUIRED
THE TREASURE CHAMBER WAS PRETTY DARK ALTHOUGH THE MOONLIGHT CAME IN THROUGH SOME OF THE WINDOWS BUT THE BOY HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THE LOW BRASS LAMP THAT LIGHTED THE CORRIDER AND THIS HE SET UPON A TABLE BESIDE THE DOOR BEFORE HE TOOK TIME TO LOOK AROUND HIM
SHE DID NOT SEEM VERY OLD FOR HER FEATURES WERE SMILING AND ATTRACTIVE AND PLEASANT TO VIEW
THEN BUTTON-BRIGHT CREPT SOFTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN AND IN ONE OF THE OUTER ROOMS HE SAT DOWN NEAR A BIG CABINET AND PUT ON HIS SHOES
I THINK THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BETTER KEEP AWAY FROM THE PRINCESSES FOR TO-NIGHT UNLESS THEY DEMAND HER PRESENCE
WHILE THIS WAS TRANSPIRING IN THE PALACE CAP'N BILL AND THE PINKIES HAD ENCAMPED BEFORE THE PRINCIPAL GATE OF THE CITY AND A TENT HAD BEEN PITCHED FOR TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND ROSALIE
HOW DARE YOU LAUGH WHEN I'M TALKING
WHY DON'T WE STOP BUTTON-BRIGHT SEEMED ASTONISHED TOO
A ONE-LEGGED SAILOR CAN'T KNOW MUCH WHY NOT ASKED TROT A LITTLE INDIGNANTLY
EVEN WHILE SHE SPOKE TROT WAS BUSY WITH THE KNOTS IN THE CORDS AND PRESENTLY SHE HAD UNBOUND TIGGLE WHO SOON GOT UPON HIS FEET
THERE WAS A LONG AND BROAD RECEPTION ROOM WITH FORTY-SEVEN WINDOWS IN IT AND OPENING OUT OF IT WERE SIX LOVELY BEDCHAMBERS EACH FURNISHED IN THE GREATEST LUXURY
NO BANNERS FLOATED FROM IT
BUT I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT UNTIL AFTER I AM MARRIED SO THEY WENT BACK TO THE PALACE AND PROPOSED TO THE NEW BOOLOOROO TO MARRY INDIGO SO THEY COULD GET THEIR MAGIC UMBRELLA
HE ADVISED THEM ALL TO WEAR THEIR RAINCOATS OVER THEIR PRETTY PINK CLOTHES SO THEY WOULD NOT GET WET AND HE ASSURED THEM THAT ALL THE CREATURES TO BE MET WITH IN THE FOG WERE PERFECTLY HARMLESS
THERE'LL BE THE AIR-RIDE THERE AN THE AIR-RIDE BACK AN THAT'S THE MAIN THING WITH ME
I'VE COME FOR THE SHOES SAID THE BOY
RUB-A-DUB DUB GIMME SOME GRUB TROT LAUGHED AND GAVE IT SOME SEEDS AND WHILE THE PARROT ATE THEM SHE STROKED GENTLY HIS SOFT FEATHERS
THE THREE STRANGERS SHALL BE TAKEN AT ONCE TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND AND THROWN OVER THE BUSHES INTO THE SKY IT'S RAINING HARD OUTSIDE ANNOUNCED CORALIE WHO SAT NEAR THE DOOR
AT THE SAME INSTANT ANOTHER BLUE CORD WOUND ITSELF AROUND THE BOY'S BODY AND OTHERS CAUGHT TROT AND CAP'N BILL IN THEIR COILS SO THAT ALL HAD THEIR ARMS PINNED FAST TO THEIR SIDES AND FOUND THEMSELVES ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS
SO IT WOULD WHILE YOU ARE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN'T DIE TILL YOU'VE LIVED SIX HUNDRED YEARS DECLARED THE OFFICER
WON'T YOU PLEASE GET RID OF THEM TOO YOUR MAJESTY
YOU'LL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS WHEN INQUIRED COBALT
SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE NOT MUCH OF A BOOLOOROO THAT REPLIED THE KING INDIGNANTLY IS A MATTER OF OPINION
HOW DARE YOU ROARED THE FRIGHTENED BOOLOOROO
DON'T SEE NO WAGGIN ER NO AUTYMOB'L HE ADDED
NO BIRD CAN TALK UNLESS INSPIRED BY WITCHCRAFT OH YES
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON THAT SEEMS TO ME SAID TROT YOU'RE ACTIN RATHER IMPERLITE TO STRANGERS
NOW THIS WAS THE CHAMBER IN WHICH GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAD BEEN CONFINED BY THE PRINCESSES HIS ARMS BEING BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY BUT HIS LEGS LEFT FREE
THE PINKIES SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS A JUST LAW AND MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE AND ROSALIE SAID
DON'T STARE AT HIM A VOICE WHISPERED IN THE BOY'S EAR
YOU DO YOUR WORK AT EVENING OR EARLY MORNING AND THE REST OF THE DAY YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO DO AS YOU PLEASE IT WON'T LAST LONG BUTTON-BRIGHT SAID CAP'N BILL CONSOLINGLY
HE WAS HIMSELF SO NERVOUS AND EXCITED THAT HE BECAME DESPERATE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF TEDIOUS WAITING DURING WHICH TIME HE PRANCED AROUND IMPATIENTLY HE DECIDED TO ATTACK THE HATED PINKIES AND RID THE COUNTRY OF THEM
WE MUST TAKE EM HOME AGAIN SAFE AN SOUND AND GET A NEW QUEEN TO RULE OVER EM
NEVER MIND SAID THE GIRL
I FAVOR TAKING THE EARTH PEOPLE TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND AND CASTING THEM INTO THE SKY FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS PERFECT SILENCE IN THE ROOM
THAT'S IT HE SAID
THEY HAVE DONE US NO HARM ANSWERED CORALIE SPEAKING FOR HER SIDE
PRETTY WET WAS THE JOURNEY YOU CAN BET DECLARED THE PARROT IN CONCLUSION
GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR SAID CAP'N BILL
BUT PROTESTED TOURMALINE THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS SAYS OUR COUNTRY SHALL HARBOR NONE BUT THE PINKIES DOES IT INDEED ASKED THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
HOW ABSURD CRIED COBALT
DON'T COME IN YELLED THE BOOLOOROO IN A TERRIFIED VOICE
ROCK-A-BYE BABY ON A TREE-TOP
THEY KNEW THAT SOME DAY THE MAJORDOMO WOULD BECOME BOOLOOROO AND EACH ONE OF THE SIX HAD DETERMINED TO MARRY HIM SO AS TO BE THE QUEEN--AND THUS FORCE HER SISTERS TO OBEY HER COMMANDS
TROT LEANED OVER AND WAVED HER HAND
AGAIN ROSALIE NODDED AND TROT THOUGHT HER EYES TWINKLED A LITTLE
THEY CLUNG TIGHTLY TO THE ROPES BUT THE BREEZE WAS WITH THEM SO AFTER A FEW MOMENTS WHEN THEY BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE MOTION THEY BEGAN TO ENJOY THE RIDE IMMENSELY
THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
IT'S MY IDEE AS HE'S BRAVER THAN THE WHOLE BLUE ARMY PUT TOGETHER YOU'RE RIGHT CAP'N SHE RETURNED
WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR OWN FATHER SLICED SO THAT YOU COULD RULE IN HIS PLACE YES YES
IT'S NO USE SIR SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT TO THE SAILOR
THAT'S ALL GOODNESS ME SAID TROT
CAP'N BILL HAD STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WATCHING WITH A FEELING AKIN TO BEWILDERMENT THE FLIGHT OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
THEN YOU'RE SOME SMARTER NER I AM MATE HE SAILED DOWN WITH THE UMBREL SHE CRIED
OR CAP'N BILL OR BUTTON-BRIGHT TOURMALINE SMILED AND SHOOK HER HEAD WHILE ALL THE COUNSELORS MURMURED THEIR PROTESTS
WHEN AT LAST THEY CAME UP TO HIM HE MADE A SECOND JUMP--OUT OF SIGHT AS BEFORE--AND WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW THEY FOUND A HUGE LIZARD LYING ACROSS THE PATH
WHEN THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE FOG BANK THE PINKIES ALL HALTED TO PUT ON THEIR RAINCOATS AND BUTTON-BRIGHT PUT UP HIS UMBRELLA AND HELD IT OVER HIMSELF AND TROT
THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
WHEN I LANDED IN BUFFALO I WAS HOT AND THIRSTY
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL US POLLY
THE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE EM A BIT SO THEY'LL BE OUTCASTS AND WANDERERS AND THAT WILL MAKE EM SORRY THEY WERE SO WICKED AN CRUEL WHEN THEY WERE POWERFUL
YOU'RE NOT MUCH OF A GUARD SEEMS TO ME BUT IF ANYONE TRIES TO ROB THE TREASURE CHAMBER YOU MUST RING THIS BIG GONG WHICH WILL ALARM THE WHOLE PALACE AND BRING THE SOLDIERS TO YOUR ASSISTANCE
AND WHEN HE THOUGHT HOW PAINFUL IT WOULD BE TO HAVE HIS BODY AND ARMS AND LEGS PRODDED AND PRICKED BY SUCH WEAPONS HE GROANED ALOUD AND WAS VERY MISERABLE
HERE'S THE KEY AND IF YOU DON'T RETURN IT TO ME WITHIN FIVE MINUTES I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED THE CAPTAIN TOOK THE KEY AND THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND HASTENED AWAY TO THE PALACE
SEEMS TO ME I'VE HEARD OF THE ISLE OF SKYE BUT THAT'S OVER IN GREAT BRITAIN SOMEWHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD
BUT AS SHE DID SO SHE BECAME VISIBLE FOR AN INSTANT EACH PAT DESTROYING THE CHARM OF THE RING WHILE THE GIRL WAS IN CONTACT WITH A LIVING CREATURE
THE MIRROR WAS BLANK SO FAR AS TROT WAS CONCERNED
I WAS SORRY UNCLE BOB WAS SO CROSS AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME YET WHERE THE GOVERNESS WAS CROSSER N HE WAS
CAN'T WE FIGHT THE FROGS FIGHT CRIED TROT
BUT HIS BLUE EYES WERE FRANK AND MERRY AND HIS SMILE LIKE A RAY OF SUNSHINE
WE'RE IN NO HURRY TO GET BACK
NO HE SAID
I KNEW IT WAS CRUEL TO THROW THESE POOR PEOPLE OVER THE EDGE BUT THAT SEEMED TO US THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE IT WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ANSWERED POLYCHROME AS STERNLY AS HER SWEET VOICE COULD SPEAK
SHE BELIEVED THE BOOLOOROO WOULD SURELY KEEP SO IMPORTANT A PRISONER AS CAP'N BILL LOCKED UP IN HIS OWN PALACE
OUR FRIENDS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN BEWILDERMENT
I'M NOT AFRAID OF THESE GAWKIES BUT THE PRINCESSES PULLED HER AFTER THEM AND SOON THEY HAD ALL DISAPPEARED INTO ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE BLUE PALACE
NOT THIS EVENING THANK YOU SIR
IN THE ROOM WHERE ROSALIE'S VISION HAD SHOWN THEM THE MAGIC UMBRELLA LYING UNDER A CABINET TROT ATTEMPTED TO FIND IT FOR SHE CONSIDERED THAT NEXT TO RESCUING CAP'N BILL THIS WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK TO ACCOMPLISH
ISN'T THAT RIGHT CAP'N I DUNNO MATE
FINALLY INDIGO SAID TO TROT
BUT WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON TROT HAD CREPT UP AND FASTENED ONE END OF HER ROPE TO THE FRAME IN WHICH CAP'N BILL WAS CONFINED
THERE ARE WOODS AND PASTURES AND SPRINGS OF CLEAR WATER AND I'M SURE WE WOULD FIND IT A FINE PLACE FOR A PICNIC IF ANYTHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY OBSERVED CAP'N BILL WE'D DROP IN THE WATER OF COURSE SAID TROT
YOU ARE RATHER SWIFT I GUESS THE FROG CHUCKLED AND LEAPED AGAIN
HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM AND RUBBED HIS EYES AGAIN SEEING NO ONE WHO COULD HAVE KISSED HIM
YOUR FRIEND BUTTON-BRIGHT THE END
IT WON'T LET YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AN IT GOES EZZAC'LY WHERE YOU SAY IF IT DIDN'T SAID TROT WE'D NEVER KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING WE DON'T KNOW NOW SAID THE SAILOR
THEN THEY MATCH HALF OF YOU TO ANOTHER PERSON WHO HAS LIKEWISE BEEN SLICED--AND THERE YOU ARE PATCHED TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT AND HAVEN'T MUCH INTEREST IN
I OUGHT TO TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID AND THEN YOU'D UNDERSTAND
TELL ME SHE SAID GENTLY TO THE BOY WHY ARE YOU HERE AND WHY DO THESE PEOPLE OF THE SKY WISH TO DESTROY YOU IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS BUTTON-BRIGHT RELATED THEIR ADVENTURE WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND HOW THE BOOLOOROO HAD STOLEN IT AND THEY HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ESCAPE INTO THE PINK COUNTRY
BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES AND HIS PURSUERS DID NOT DARE FOLLOW HIM FAR IN THAT DIRECTION
WE'LL HAVE MUSIC AND DANCING AND EATING AND ILLUSTRATION AN NECKTIES TO DRINK TROT
THE BEST WAY TO MANAGE A HUSBAND OBSERVED CERULIA ANGRILY IS TO PULL HIS NOSE LADIES SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE WHEN HE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK DO NOT ANTICIPATE THESE PLEASURES I BEG OF YOU FOR I SHALL CHOOSE NONE AMONG YOU FOR A WIFE WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT SAID INDIGO
MRS GRIFFITH WAS VERY KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT NOT QUITE SO AGREEABLE TOWARD POOR CAP'N BILL
ALSO HIS WIFE THE QUEEN HAD MADE HIM ANGRY BY BEGGING FOR GOLD TO BUY RIBBONS WITH
WHY HAVE YOU DECREED DEATH TO THESE INNOCENT STRANGERS SHE ASKED
I REMEMBER THAT YOU WANTED IT AND SO I HAVE KEPT IT WITH ME EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT
AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE TROT NOW SENT FOR THE PRINCESSES WHO HAD BEEN WEEPING AND WAILING AND FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES EVER SINCE THEY LEARNED THAT THEIR FATHER HAD BEEN CONQUERED
KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE
THEN SHE CALLED IN A LOUD IMPERATIVE VOICE
BUT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA KEPT STEADILY UPON ITS WAY
HIS MAJESTY ISN'T HIS MAJESTY ANY LONGER
WERE YOU EVER IN THE LAND OF OZ YES HE ANSWERED STILL LOOKING AT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER
AND THE KEY'S IN THE KING'S OWN POCKET ADDED TROT DESPAIRINGLY
WE'LL GO HOME PRETTY SOON NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE BEEN PUNISHED EXCLAIMED THE BOOLOOROO STERNLY
WHILE THEY WERE GONE ON THIS ERRAND THE BOOLOOROO BEGGED TO BE RELEASED WHINING AND WAILING FOR FEAR THE KNIFE WOULD FALL UPON HIM
THE BOOLOOROO MAY DECIDE TO PATCH HIM AT ONCE ADDED BUTTON-BRIGHT WITH EQUAL SADNESS FOR HE TOO MOURNED THE SAILOR'S LOSS
WHY I'M ONLY SIXTY MYSELF AN I GUESS I LOOK TWICE AS OLD AS YOUR KING DOES WE DO NOT SHOW OUR AGE IN LOOKS THE OFFICER ANSWERED
YES SAID TROT
HE REALLY LONGED TO TAKE THE AIR-RIDE BUT WAS FEARFUL OF DANGER
THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE
I WAS GOING PRETTY FAST FOR WHEN I LOOKED DOWN ALL THE BIG BUILDINGS WERE SLIDING PAST ME SO SWIFT THAT IT MADE ME DIZZY AND BEFORE I REALLY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE UMBRELLA SETTLED DOWN AND STOOD ME ON MY FEET AT UNCLE BOB'S FRONT GATE
OH WHAT A DUMP
BUT IF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY I MAY BE OBLIGED TO CALL UPON ROSALIE FOR HELP
SHE MERELY THANKED CORALIE AND THE PINKIES AND SAID THEY MIGHT ALL COME TO THE COURT AFTER DINNER AND SEE HER AND HER COMRADES FLY AWAY THROUGH THE SKY
WHY SEE HERE BUTT'N-BRIGHT WE'VE GOT HALF-A-DOZEN UMBRELS IN THE CLOSET THAT'S BETTER NER YOURS PERHAPS SAID THE BOY
DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN FOLLER THAT LEAD REMARKED CAP'N BILL
FOR IN WAR SOME ONE IS LIKELY TO GET HURT AND IT IS FOOLISH TO TAKE SUCH CHANCES WHEN ONE CAN REMAIN QUIETLY AT HOME
BUTTON-BRIGHT NODDED AGAIN
HE HAD TAKEN HIS PRECIOUS UMBRELLA TO BED WITH HIM AND EVEN CARRIED IT TO THE BREAKFAST TABLE WHERE HE STOOD IT BETWEEN HIS KNEES AS HE ATE
YOU ARE STRANGERS HERE AND I DON'T WANT YOU IMPOSED UPON
BUT TROT SHOOK HER HEAD
BEFORE I DECIDE I MUST SEE WHO THESE STRANGERS ARE
WHAT ARE YOU GRINNING AT CAP'N BILL
OH VERY WELL REPLIED JIMFRED
SO THIS IS HOW YOU WASTE YOUR TIME IS IT EXCLAIMED THE PRINCESS AND GRABBING TROT'S ARM SHE JERKED THE GIRL TO HER FEET AND BEGAN PUSHING HER FROM THE ROOM
STOP IT THIS MINUTE YOU OLD PIRATE OR I'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY I DIDN'T MUM SAID CAP'N BILL MEEKLY I ON'Y STOP RIGHT THERE SIR
OH CAP'N IT'S GAL-LOR-IOUS SHE CRIED IN ECSTASY
YOUR STORY IS THE STRANGEST WE HAVE EVER HEARD SAID SHE
BUT YOU ARE CAP'N AND I'VE COME TO SAVE YOU ALL ALONE TROT ALL ALONE CAP'N BILL
AS LIKE AS NOT I'VE BEEN FORGOT CAP'N BILL JUMPED THIS WAY AND BUTTON-BRIGHT THAT AND THEN THERE ALIGHTED ON TROT'S SHOULDER THE BLUE PARROT THAT HAD BEEN THE PET OF THE PRINCESS CERULIA
THEN PUT IT IN THE RACK BEHIND THE DOOR SHE URGED
TROT WAS JOYOUS AND GREATLY EXCITED
AND A LITTLE WEE TINY FROG TOO
DEAR ME SAID TROT THROWING HERSELF INTO A CHAIR WASN'T THAT A SUDDEN CHANGE OF FORTUNE THOUGH
WON'T YOU COME HOME WITH US I'D LIKE TO REPLIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
GET TO WORK AT ONCE AND MAKE YOURSELVES LONG SHARP STICKS AND THEN WE WILL ATTACK THE ENEMY AGAIN SO THE SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS ALL SET TO WORK PREPARING LONG SHARP STICKS AND WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS ROSALIE THE WITCH HAD A VISION IN WHICH SHE SAW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE CITY WALL
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ADMITTED THE SAILOR
I SHALL CALL YOU OLD MOONFACE REPLIED THE KING FOR THAT SUITS YOU QUITE WELL
YOUR PAY FOR BEIN A QUEEN IS SORT O LIKE A LIFE-INSURANCE
IT'S NOT THE BOOLOOROO'S PLACE TO MIX NECTAR WAS THE STERN REPLY
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK THE PINKIES WERE AMAZED AT THE STRANGE RECEPTION OF THE BLUES AND HESITATED TO ADVANCE
I CAN SEE TREES AN PONDS AN HOUSES
HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE MADE OF TWO SEPARATE MEN EACH CUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND THEN JOINED TOGETHER HALF OF ONE TO HALF OF THE OTHER
ALL THE PETS BEGAN TO FOLLOW HER AND SEEING THIS INDIGO YELLED AT THEM TO KEEP BACK
TROT THOUGHT THE PRETTY QUEEN WAS THEIR FRIEND SO SHE SAID
THEN HE TOUCHED THE END OF HIS NOSE AND STILL ANOTHER BELL WAS FAINTLY HEARD
ALL THE BLUESKINS EXCEPT A FEW SENTRIES HAD GONE TO BED AND WERE SOUND ASLEEP
HE WAS THIN WITH A RATHER PALE COMPLEXION AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE ROUND AND EARNEST
BEATS THEM AEROPLANES AN THINGS ALL HOLLER CAUSE IT DON'T NEED ANY REGULATIN IF WE'RE GOING TO THAT ISLAND WE MAY AS WELL START RIGHT AWAY SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT WHEN THEY HAD SAFELY LANDED
SHE WENT BACK TO THE TENT WHERE ROSALIE AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WERE SITTING IN THE MOONLIGHT AND ASKED THE WITCH IF THERE WAS NO WAY IN WHICH SHE COULD SECRETLY GET INTO THE CITY OF THE BLUES AND SEARCH FOR HER FRIEND
I GUESS I WON'T GO TO CHICAGO
PERHAPS IF WE KEEP THEM WITH US FOR AWHILE THEY MAY FIND A WAY TO RETURN SAFELY TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY WE'LL FLY THROUGH THE SKY BY-AND-BY--KI-YI YELLED THE PARROT WITH STARTLING SUDDENNESS
EVERYTHING WAS BLUE HERE JUST AS WAS EVERYTHING IN THE ROYAL PALACE AND GARDENS AND A BLUE HAZE OVERHUNG ALL THE CITY
THERE SHE CALLED FOR THE KING OF THE GIANT FROGS WHO CAME AT HER BIDDING AND THE TWO HELD AN EARNEST AND LONG TALK TOGETHER
WELL TRY TO KEEP THIS ONE
PRETTY SOON A SMALL ISLAND APPEARED AND TROT EXCLAIMED
JUST LIKE YOUR OWN NICKNAME HAPPENED HE ANSWERED GLOOMILY
CAN YOU TELL US MISTER--MISTRESS--GOOD MR FROG--EH--EH--YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS--IF WE'RE ON THE RIGHT ROAD TO THE PINK COUNTRY THE FROG SEEMED TO LAUGH FOR HE GURGLED IN HIS THROAT IN A VERY FUNNY WAY
WE'RE GOIN DOWN ON THE BLUE PART O THE ISLAND HE SAID
FIRST BIND THE EARTH MAN IN THE FRAME COMMANDED THE BOOLOOROO
BUT I WILL SAY THAT EVERY BOOLOOROO IS ELECTED TO REIGN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND I'VE REIGNED NOT QUITE--AHEM!--TWO HUNDRED ARE YOUR KINGS ELECTED THEN ASKED CAP'N BILL
THAT IS MY REWARD I'M SORRY FOR YOU MA'AM SAID CAP'N BILL
BUTTON-BRIGHT TOLD THIS AND THEN TROT RELATED THEIR ADVENTURES AMONG THE BLUESKINS AND HOW THE BOOLOOROO HAD STOLEN THE UMBRELLA AND PREVENTED THEM FROM GOING HOME AGAIN
AND THEY MADE US SLAVES SAID TROT
I WISH I COULD GET BACK TO IT SO DO I BUTTON-BRIGHT EXCLAIMED TROT
GOT HOME SAFE TROT AND THE FOLKS WERE SO WORRIED THEY FORGOT TO SCOLD ME
CAP'N BILL AND I PERPOSE RUNNIN THIS ISLAND OURSELVES AFTER THIS
ALTHOUGH TROT AND HER COMRADES WERE STILL PRISONERS THEY WERE FAR MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THEY HAD BEEN IN THE BLUE COUNTRY
IT WAS NAMED IN DARK BLUE LETTERS STAMPED ON THE LEATHER THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK AND REMEMBERING THAT GHIP-GHISIZZLE LONGED TO POSSESS THIS BOOK BUTTON-BRIGHT HASTILY CONCEALED IT INSIDE HIS BLOUSE
THE APARTMENTS OCCUPIED BY THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WERE SO MAGNIFICENT THAT WHEN TROT FIRST ENTERED THEM LED BY HER HAUGHTY CAPTORS SHE THOUGHT THEY MUST BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROOMS IN ALL THE WORLD
I DON'T MEAN TO STAY IN THIS DISMAL BLUE COUNTRY LONG EVEN IF I AM THE QUEEN
WHEN SHE FINALLY OPENED THE DOOR HE SLIPPED OFF AND LET HIMSELF FALL TO THE WALL WHERE HE DOUBLED UP IN A HEAP
AS FER PO'TRY SAID HE THAT'S AS HOW YOU LOOK AT PO'TRY
HOW DARE YOU COME INTO MY GARDEN AND KNOCK ME ON THE HEAD WITH THAT AWFUL BASKET AND THEN FALL ON MY TOES AND CAUSE ME PAIN AND SUFFERING
AT LAST THE BOOLOOROO THREW IT DOWN AND STAMPED UPON IT AND THEN KICKED IT INTO A CORNER WHERE IT ROLLED UNDERNEATH A CABINET
BUTTON-BRIGHT TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN ALONG THE PASSAGES UNTIL HE CAME TO CAP'N BILL'S ROOM WHERE THE SAILORMAN AND TROT WERE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING HIM
I'M AN OL MAN MYSELF BUT IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE I'LL SPANK YOU LIKE I WOULD A BABY AN IT WON'T BE ANY TROUBLE AT ALL TO DO IT THANK'E
GOOD-BYE MATE SAID CAP'N BILL PREPARING TO DESCEND
MEANTIME THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES HAD SEEN FROM THEIR ROOMS IN A TOWER OF THE PALACE THE ARMY OF THE PINKIES MARCHING UPON THEM AND THE SIGHT HAD SERVED TO EXCITE THEM GREATLY
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION TROT'S INVISIBLE ADVENTURE CHAPTER 22
I'VE FOUND THAT OUT BEFORE THIS
THE SUNRISE TRIBE CLAIMED THAT EVERY DAY THE SUN GREETED THEM FIRST OF ALL WHICH PROVED THEY WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT
BUT I WILL SEARCH IN THE GREAT BOOK AND SEE IF I CAN FIND ANYTHING THAT REFERS TO STRANGE PEOPLE ENTERING OUR LAND IF NOT SAID THE WOMAN YOU MUST MAKE A LAW
WHERE ARE YOU TROT
HI THERE
HE LIVES WAY OFF IN PHILLYDELPHY MERCY SAKES ALIVE CRIED MRS GRIFFITH LOOKING INTO HIS UPTURNED FACE
THEN THEY CANNOT THROW YOU OFF THE WITCH REPLIED
BUT I'M QUITE POSITIVE HER PEOPLE CAN'T DO IT THIS STATEMENT ASTONISHED ALL THE PINKIES WHO LOOKED AT THE WITCH INQUIRINGLY
IF YOU DELAY MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY ONE WE SHALL ALL BE CAPTURED
THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY WINNING--SOMETHING JOLLY AND CARE-FREE AND HONEST AND SOCIABLE--ABOUT THE ANCIENT SEAMAN THAT MADE HIM EVERYBODY'S FRIEND
THE BLUESKINS FELL BACK HORRIFIED AT THE MAD ACT OF THE STRANGERS
LET ME KNOW IF YOU GET HOME SAFE BUTTON-BRIGHT
AND NOW SAID SHE I WANT TO SAY TO GHIP-'SIZZLE THAT JUS AS SOON AS WE CAN FIND BUTTON-BRIGHT'S UMBREL WE'RE GOING TO FLY HOME AGAIN
IF WE COULD ONLY GET HOLD OF MY MAGIC UMBRELLA WE'D BE ALL RIGHT THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE BUT THE UMBREL'S STOLE BY THE BOO-LOO-ROO SCREAMED THE PARROT
AS HE STOOD BENT NEARLY DOUBLE HIS BACK WAS TOWARD THE BILLYGOAT WHICH IN THEIR INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT THE SOLDIERS WERE HOLDING IN A CARELESS MANNER
I'M MORE AFEARED O THEM BLUE CITIZENS NER I AM O THE BLUE BOOLOOROO
IS THE MONSTER MAN WHOSE LEGS ARE PART WOOD A DANGEROUS CREATURE ASKED ONE OF THE SUNRISE TRIBE
TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE ALL SOAKED TO THE SKIN AND CHILLED THROUGH BUT AS THEY SAT UPON THE PINK GRASS THEY FELT THE RAYS OF THE SUN SENDING THEM WARMTH AND RAPIDLY DRYING THEIR CLOTHES
FATHER HAS TAKEN THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND LOCKED IT UP IN A BIG STRONG CHEST IN THE ATTIC
HERE IN THE SERVANTS HALL THERE WAS ONE VACANT SEAT NEXT TO BUTTON-BRIGHT WHICH WAS RESERVED FOR TROT
DON'T THINK AS EVER I SAWR HIM AT THE VILLAGE HE REMARKED
I DON'T MIX IT
THE BLUESKINS ARE TALL AN LANKY AN UGLY AN FIERCE AN IF THEY HAPPEN TO CAPTURE YOU YOU'LL ALL BE PATCHED--WHICH IS A DEEP DISGRACE AN A UNCOMFERTABLE MIX-UP WILL THEY THROW US OVER THE EDGE ASKED CAPTAIN TINTINT NERVOUSLY
ONE EAR WAS BIG AND STUCK OUT FROM THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD WHILE THE OTHER EAR WAS SMALL AND FLAT
HE SAID IT WAS A FAM'LY RELIC THAT HAD BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON FOR MANY GENERATIONS
WHAT SHALL WE DO SHE ASKED
THE POOR FELLOW HAS BEEN PATCHED THAT'S ALL BUTTON-BRIGHT TURNED TO SEE WHO HAD SPOKEN AND FOUND BY HIS SIDE A TALL YOUNG BLUESKIN WITH A BLUE-GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK
ONE ARMY'S PINK AND ONE IS BLUE BUT NEITHER ONE IS IN A STEW BECAUSE THE NAUGHTY BOOLOOROO IS OUT OF SIGHT SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS TRY TO BE A JOLLY CREW AND DANCE AND SING OUR TOO-RAL-LOO AND TO OUR FRIENDS BE EVER TRUE AND TO OUR FOES STOP IT SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
CAP'N BILL WAS ALERT AND HAD TOLD HIS ARMY WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF AN ATTACK
BUTTON-BRIGHT DID NOT HESITATE
YOUR SKY ISLAND AIN'T VERY BIG SO WHEN WE COULDN'T STAY IN THE BLUE COUNTRY WHERE EVER'BODY HATED US OR IN THE FOG BANK WHICH AIN'T HEALTHY AN IS TOO WET FOR HUMANS TO LIVE IN FOR LONG WE NAT'RALLY WERE FORCED TO ENTER THE PINK COUNTRY WHERE WE EXPECTED TO FIND NICE PEOPLE WE ARE NICE SAID TOURMALINE
HOW DO YOU MIX IT ASKED CAP'N BILL
BLUESKINS GUESS AGAIN
I LIKE MYSELF VERY MUCH BUT I CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO LIKE ME BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFORMED AND IGNORANT I'M NOT CRIED TROT
I WANTED TO DISCOVER WHO WOULD COME TO YOUR ASSISTANCE AND I FOUND OUT
BUT EVER'BODY CALLS ME TROT IT'S A NICKNAME I GOT WHEN I WAS A BABY CAUSE I TROTTED SO FAST WHEN I WALKED AN IT SEEMS TO STICK
HAIN'T WALKED THE NINE MILE FROM THE RAILROAD STATION HEV YE ASKED CAP'N BILL
SHE SEEMED MOTHERLY AND GOOD AND WHEN SHE SAW BUTTON-BRIGHT SHE EXCLAIMED
CAP'N BILL FROWNED AND SET HIS JAWS TIGHT TOGETHER
FOLLOW ME PLEASE AND THEN HE BECKONED TO CAP'N BILL AND LED THE TWO SLAVES TO ANOTHER ROOM WHERE THEY WERE ALONE
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE RULER OF SKY ISLAND CHAPTER 25
IT WAS OF WOOD AND CARVED TO RESEMBLE AN ELEPHANT'S HEAD
THE SUNSET COUNTRY SOUNDS SORT O GOOD TO ME BUT HOW'LL WE EVER MANAGE TO GET THERE INQUIRED TROT
FRANK BAUM AUTHOR OF THE SEA FAIRIES THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD IN OZ OZMA OF OZ THE ROAD TO OZ THE LAND OF OZ ETC
SEEMS LIKE A REG'LAR DRIZZLE SAID TROT
BECAUSE THE RULER IS THE MOS RISTICRATIC PERSON IN ANY LAND EXPLAINED THE LITTLE GIRL
POLYCHROME BEGAN TURNING OVER THE LEAVES WHILE THE OTHERS ALL WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY AND IN SILENCE
THEN SHE ASKED
IT WOULD REMIND HER CORALIE DECLARED OF THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF SUNSET AND SUNRISE AND OF THE FACT THAT THE PINKIES WOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO WELCOME HER BACK
AT THE VERY EDGE OF THE FOG BANK THE ELEPHANT HALTED WINKED AT BUTTON-BRIGHT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND BEGAN TO SHRINK IN SIZE AND DWINDLE AWAY
YOU LET THE POOR OLD BOOLOOROO ALONE
THEN IT CRIED OUT
OH WHAT A JUMP
HE WAS LOOKING DOWNCAST AND SAD AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HE HAD NOT CONQUERED THE BOOLOOROO HIMSELF
THE LAD'S GRAN'THER WERE PROB'LY A FURRINER AN YOURS AN MINE WERE TOO TROT IF YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH
IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
I CAN'T DECIDE IN A HURRY
I'LL SEND TIGGLE TO THE ROYAL PANTRY AND KEEP HIM THERE TO MIX THE NECTAR
I'M NO MURDERER THANK GOODNESS AND I WOULDN'T KILL YOU IF I COULD--MUCH AS YOU DESERVE IT BUT ISN'T SIX HUNDRED YEARS AN AWFUL LONG TIME TO LIVE QUESTIONED TROT
BUT THE FROG WAS UNABLE TO OBEY HIS REQUEST
SO-HO ROARED THE MONARCH YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD DEFY ME EARTH CLOD DID YOU
THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THESE GATES AND FROM THEIR RECESSES STONE STEPS LED TO THE TOP OF THE WALL
GUESS NOT CAP'N SHE ANSWERED
THEY FIGHT WITH LONG CORDS THAT HAVE WEIGHTS ON THE ENDS WHICH COIL ROUND YOU AN MAKE YOU HELPLESS IN A JIFFY
SO RAPID HAD BEEN THEIR DESCENT WHEN THE UMBRELLA LANDED THEM IN THE ROYAL GARDEN THAT THEY HAD NOT EVEN CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLUE CITY SO NOW THEY GAZED WITH WONDER AND INTEREST AT THE SPLENDID SIGHTS THAT MET THEIR EYES
WHEN SHE WENT IN SHE FOUND THAT BOTH BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE UP AND DRESSED SO THEY DECIDED TO TAKE A WALK BEFORE BREAKFAST
IT MAY TAKE FOUR PERHAPS TO LIFT THE HUGE AND ANCIENT MAN MORE'N THAT SAID CAP'N BILL GRIMLY
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO SPEND YOUR TIME A-RULIN THIS TUCKED-UP COUNTRY TROT WHY NOT ASKED TROT WHO WAS PLEASED WITH HER NEW AND IMPORTANT POSITION
GO BACK AND WAIT TILL MORNING COMMANDED THE GUARD
I'M SORRY BUT I'M DUE AT THE KING'S COURT IN A FEW MINUTES AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR SHORT WEAK LEGS TO MAKE THE JOURNEY TO THE PINK COUNTRY
I'M A CLAM WITHOUT A SHELL CAN'T YOU DRY UP ASKED CAP'N BILL
IF YOU SAY YOU'LL GO CAP'N I'LL RUN IN AN PACK A BASKET OF LUNCH HOW'LL WE CARRY IT SWING IT TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SEAT THE OLD SAILOR STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
THERE'S A BIG CLOUD JUST OVER THE MIDDLE
AT ONCE THE UMBRELLA ROSE INTO THE AIR
WHEN THE TRAVELERS COULD COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND SIT UP THEY STARED ABOUT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR THE TRANSITION FROM THE STICKY DAMP FOG TO THIS BRILLIANT SCENE WAS SO ABRUPT AS TO DAZE THEM AT FIRST
I'M SORT O DRIPPY MYSELF CRIED THE PARROT FLUTTERING HIS FEATHERS TO TRY TO KEEP THEM FROM STICKING TOGETHER
IT IS AN INSULT TO BE SPOKEN TO BY ONE ABOUT TO BE PATCHED CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO
IT'S AWFUL WET YOU BET MOANED THE PARROT ON HER SHOULDER
BUT THEY CAN'T SEE YOU SAID CAP'N BILL
THE RUSH OF AIR PAST THEM MADE THEM HUNGRY SO CAP'N BILL DREW UP THE LUNCH-BASKET AND HELD IT SO THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT COULD HELP THEMSELVES TO THE PINK FOOD WHICH TASTED VERY GOOD
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION TOURMALINE THE POVERTY QUEEN CHAPTER 14
WHEN WE COME TO THE BLUE COUNTRY THOUGH HE ADDED YOU'RE LIABLE TO BE PRETTY BUSY
SO IT WAS NO WONDER THAT WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL ENTERED THE FIFTH BOUDOIR SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE PARROT THE LAMB THE CAT AND THE DOG WHO ALL STOOD BESIDE HER AND WATCHED HER FEED THE PEACOCK WHICH SHE FOUND STRUTTING AROUND AND MEWING LIKE A CAT FOR HIS DINNER
GET OFF FROM MY FEET I SAY CRIED AN EXCITED VOICE
SINCE I HAVE ASKED THESE GOOD PEOPLE TO ADVISE ME IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE TO SIDE AGAINST SOME OF THEM AND WITH THE OTHERS
QUEEN O THE PINKIES AN BOSS O THE BLUES
THEY MUST GO WITH THEIR DEAR FATHER AN MOTHER
AND JUS AS SOON AS YOU'VE SPREAD THE NEWS AN GOT THE BANDS TUNED UP AND THE SOLDIERS READY TO MARCH YOU LET US KNOW AND WE'LL HEAD THE PROCESSION YOUR MICROSCOPIC MAJESTY SHALL BE OBEYED SAID THE CAPTAIN AND WENT AWAY TO CARRY OUT THESE COMMANDS
IT WAS AN EXCITING RIDE
PERHAPS IF GHIP-GHISIZZLE WHO WAS THEIR FAVORITE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT THEY WOULD HAVE MOBBED OUR FRIENDS WITH VICIOUS ILL-WILL AND MIGHT HAVE SERIOUSLY INJURED THEM
FOLKS DON'T LEARN THINGS WITH THEIR LEGS DO THEY NO
OUR FOLKS WILL WORRY ABOUT US AND EARTH'S THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE AFTER ALL
THEY COULD SEE DIMLY THE MASS OF FOG WHICH SEEMED TO CLING TO THEM AND WHEN THEY LOOKED DOWN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THEY WERE WALKING UPON WHITE PEBBLES THAT WERE SLIGHTLY TINGED WITH THE BLUE COLOR OF THE SKY
WHAT ARGUMENTS ARE ADVANCED BY THE SIX COUNSELORS WHO VOTED TO ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN HERE AS GUESTS INQUIRED THE WITCH
THEN HE SENT FOR GHIP-GHISIZZLE
I'M AFEARED WE'RE A-GOIN TO BUMP SOMETHIN THEY WERE CERTAINLY DROPPING VERY QUICKLY NOW AND THE RUSH OF AIR MADE THEIR EYES FILL WITH WATER SO THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE MUCH BELOW THEM
WHY I'M AN AMERICAN SNUBNOSES AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ROYALER THAN AN AMERICAN I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS THE PRINCESSES SEEMED UNCERTAIN WHAT REPLY TO MAKE TO THIS SPEECH AND BEGAN WHISPERING TOGETHER
BUT P'RAPS YOU'LL STAY HERE ALL YOUR LIVES I THINK WE SHALL REPLIED ROSALIE LAUGHING FOR IN ALL SKY ISLAND THERE WILL BE NO MAGIC UMBRELLA FOR US TO FLY WITH AND WHEN YOU SEE POLYCHROME ADDED TROT JUS GIVE HER MY LOVE THEN SHE AND BUTTON-BRIGHT SEATED THEMSELVES IN THE DOUBLE SEAT WHICH WAS FLAT UPON THE PINK GROUND AND CAP'N BILL SAT BEFORE THEM ON HIS OWN SEAT TO WHICH THE LUNCH BASKET HAD BEEN FASTENED BY MEANS OF A STOUT CORD
BUT I AM CURIOUS TO SEE IN WHAT MANNER THE FAIRIES WILL DEFEND THEM AND THEREFORE I VOTED TO HAVE THEM THROWN OFF THE ISLAND
I'LL TAKE YOU ON ANOTHER TRIP IF YOU LIKE SAID HE I'M IN NO HURRY TO GO HOME AND IF YOU WILL LET ME STAY WITH YOU ANOTHER DAY WE CAN MAKE TWO OR THREE LITTLE TRIPS WITH THE FAMILY LUCK YOU MUS STAY A WHOLE WEEK SAID TROT DECIDEDLY
BUT I'M THE RULER HERE AND I'LL DO AS I PLEASE
FINALLY THEY RETURNED TO THE GREAT THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE WHERE THEY SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE THRONE AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BECOME OF THE PRECIOUS UMBRELLA
THEN ONE OF HER QUAINT IDEAS CAME TO HER--SO QUAINT THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY SENSIBLE
SURELY THIS WAS A WONDERFUL COUNTRY AND MUCH MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN THE BLUE SIDE OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE SUN WAS HIDDEN BY THE GREAT FOG BANK AND ONLY THE MOON WAS VISIBLE
THE SKIRTS--WHICH OF COURSE WERE OF MANY SHADES OF PINK--WERE SO FLUFFY AND LIGHT THAT THEY STUCK OUT FROM THE FAT BODIES OF THE PINKIE WOMEN LIKE THE SKIRTS OF BALLET-DANCERS DISPLAYING THEIR CHUBBY PINK ANKLES AND PINK KID SHOES
CAP'N BILL WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIS DEAR LITTLE FRIEND AGAIN AND SO WAS BUTTON-BRIGHT AND NOW THAT THEY WERE REUNITED--FOR A TIME AT LEAST--THEY PAID LITTLE HEED TO THE SOUR LOOKS AND TAUNTING REMARKS OF THE UGLY BLUESKINS AND ATE HEARTILY OF THE DINNER WHICH WAS REALLY VERY GOOD
HAVE YOU CONQUERED US THEN ASKED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS IN A SURPRISED TONE
GHIP-GHISIZZLE SAID IT WAS A TERRIBLE COUNTRY I DON'T BELIEVE IT RETORTED THE SAILOR STOUTLY
THERE IS A LAW THAT IF ANY OF THE BLUESKINS BREAK THROUGH THE FOG BANK THEY SHALL BE DRIVEN BACK WITH SHARP STICKS
WHEN THE STRANGERS WERE SEATED SHE TURNED TO THEM AND SAID
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS SOME SHARP CONTRAST TO ENHANCE THE CHARM OF YOUR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THESE THREE PEOPLE WITH YOU WOULD BE A BENEFIT RATHER THAN AN INJURY TO YOU AT THIS THE PINKIES LOOKED DOWNCAST AND ASHAMED WHILE ONLY ROSALIE THE WITCH LAUGHED AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THE REBUKE
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM PHILADELPHIA SAID HE
CREEP-A-MOUSIE CRAWL-A-MOUSIE PLEASE MOVE ON
BUT THIS INCIDENT HAD DETERMINED THE PINKIES TO CONSIDER OUR FRIENDS PRISONERS AND TO TAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEIR QUEEN
I'M WILLING TO BE SAVED MATE HE SAID FOR THE BOO-L'ROO IS SET ON PATCHIN ME RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAS WHICH I HOPE THE COOK'LL BE LATE WITH WHO ARE YOU TO BE PATCHED WITH SHE ASKED
MY GOVERNESS WOULDN'T LET ME GO WITHOUT ONE AND ILLUSTRATION OH SAID TROT
HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP O COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAP'N BILL
THERE WERE NO HORSES NOR COWS IN THIS LAND BUT THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLUE GOATS FROM WHICH THE PEOPLE GOT THEIR MILK
WELL WELL
TROT LOCKED THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE SO NO ONE COULD DISTURB THEM AND THEN LED THE SAILOR TO THE WINDOW
DO YOU THINK IT'S A FAIRY COUNTRY TROT CAN'T SAY I'M SURE SHE ANSWERED
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE KING'S TREASURE CHAMBER CHAPTER 10
I HAD IT BROUGHT FROM THE TREASURE CHAMBER AND TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK BUT THERE WAS NO MAGIC ABOUT THE THING
SCENES PRESENTED THEMSELVES ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THEY HAD SEEN ON THEIR FORMER VOYAGE FOR THE SKY CHANGES CONTINUALLY AND THE CLOUDS OF THE MOMENT ARE NOT THE CLOUDS OF AN HOUR AGO
THE LITTLE GIRL LAUGHED SOFTLY
SHE DIDN'T SEE ANY WINGS ON HIM
BUT THE PARROT DID NOT MIND THE CHANGE AND WAS AS MUCH EXCITED AS ANYONE IN THE CROWD
BUT TAKE ALL THE PRISONERS YOU CAN MY BRAVE MEN AND TO-MORROW WE WILL HAVE A JOLLY TIME PATCHING THEM
CAP'N BILL THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GIANT ALLIGATOR AT FIRST IT WAS SO BIG
JUST THEN A DOOR IN THE PALACE OPENED AND OUT TROOPED A GROUP OF GIRLS
THE BIRD SEEMED MUCH ASTONISHED AT THE UNUSUAL CARESS AND TURNED UPON THE GIRL FIRST ONE LITTLE EYE AND THEN THE OTHER AS IF TRYING TO DISCOVER WHY SHE WAS SO KIND
IT WON'T BE EASY BUTTON-BRIGHT ADMITTED
SO IMMEDIATELY THEY BEGAN MARCHING THROUGH THE FOG BEHIND THE ELEPHANT AND AS THE GREAT BEAST ADVANCED THE FROGS SCRAMBLED OUT OF HIS WAY AND HID THEMSELVES IN THE MOIST BANKS UNTIL HE HAD PASSED THEM BY
SO HE DECIDED NOT TO FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT AND MEEKLY HOBBLED ALONG THE STREET AS HE WAS COMMANDED TO DO
YOU MUST GO INTO THE BLUE COUNTRY AND FORCE THE BOOLOOROO TO GIVE UP YOUR PROPERTY THROUGH THE FOG BANK ASKED CAP'N BILL DOUBTFULLY
ALL OF SKY ISLAND EXCEPT THE FOG BANK IS NOW MY KINGDOM SO I WELCOME MY FAITHFUL PINKIES TO MY BLUE CITY WHERE YOU ARE TO BE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
BUT OF COURSE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WOULD OBEY NO ONE BUT A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAT RIGHTFULLY OWNED IT
THEN WHEN THE BOOLOOROO OR THE QUEEN OR ANY OF THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES CALL FOR A DRINK YOU CAN CARRY IT TO THEM AND IT WILL BE SURE TO SUIT THEM THANK'E SIR SAID CAP'N BILL
WE CAME TO SKY ISLAND BY MISTAKE AND WANTED TO GO RIGHT AWAY AGAIN
HERE A SOLDIER WAS ON GUARD BUT HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO REST HIMSELF
THE PARROT PERCHED UPON THE BACK OF QUEEN TROT'S CHAIR AND THE GIRL FED IT HERSELF BEING GLAD TO HAVE THE JOLLY BIRD WITH HER AGAIN
IT IS EVIDENT TO ME SAID THE WITCH SPEAKING SLOWLY AND DISTINCTLY THAT THESE EARTH PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED IN SOME WAY BY FAIRIES
WHEN SHE WAS ALONE TROT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND LAUGHED UNTIL THE TEARS CAME TO HER EYES AND SHE HUGGED ALL THE PETS AND KISSED THEM EVERY ONE AND THANKED THEM FOR PROTECTING HER
BUT WE HAD TO GO SOMEWHERE AN THIS WAS THE LIKELIEST PLACE WE COULD THINK OF
WE THOUGHT WE HEARD FOOTSTEPS SAID ONE
I'M SURE I DO NOT KNOW REPLIED THE WITCH
TINTINT HAD A VERY PINK SKIN AND EYES SO FADED IN THEIR PINK COLOR THAT HE SQUINTED BADLY IN ORDER TO SEE ANYTHING AROUND HIM
A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD THE WHITE COTTAGE WHERE TROT LIVED
NOT TO MY FRIENDS REPLIED CAP'N BILL MUCH AMUSED
SEE THAT IT IS SAFELY LOCKED UP
GREET YOUR NEW QUEEN PINKIES ONE BY ONE THEY ALL ADVANCED KNELT BEFORE TROT AND PRESSED HER HAND TO THEIR LIPS
THE BOOLOOROO WENT OUT TOO BUT HE KEPT WELL BEHIND HIS PEOPLE REMEMBERING THE SHARP STICKS WITH WHICH THE ENEMY WERE ARMED
I DRAGGED IT OUT AND THREW IT ON THE RUBBISH HEAP IN AN ALLEY BACK OF THE PALACE SAID TIGGLE
BUT TOURMALINE'S THOUGHTS REQUIRED TIME AND ALL HER COUNSELORS REMAINED SILENT AND WATCHED HER ANXIOUSLY
I'M DREAMING ABOUT PARSNIPS
DARE TO DISOBEY US AND YOU WILL QUICKLY FIND OUT SNAPPED INDIGO SWAYING HER HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE ON ITS LONG SWAN-LIKE NECK LIKE THE PENDULUM OF A CLOCK
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE PINK COUNTRY CHAPTER 13
THEY HAD NOT JOURNEYED TEN MINUTES BEFORE THEY CAME DIRECTLY OVER THE ISLAND AND LOOKING DOWN THEY COULD SEE THE FORESTS AND MEADOWS FAR BELOW THEM
WELL I'M BACK AGAIN SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
THEN IT CAME TROT'S TURN TO GET A SCOLDING
NEXT SHE HURRIED TO CAP'N BILL AND BEGAN TO UNBIND HIM AND AS SHE TOUCHED THE SAILOR SHE BECAME VISIBLE
YOU'VE MADE A FRIEND OF ME LITTLE GIRL AND IF EVER I CAN HELP YOU I'LL DO IT WITH PLEASURE THEN TROT STARTED FOR THE DOOR AND TIGGLE COULD NO LONGER SEE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT NOW TOUCHING HIM
WHY LAD IT TAKES THREE OR FOUR DAYS FOR THE RAILROAD TRAINS TO GET TO THIS COAST FROM CHICAGO I KNOW REPLIED BUTTON-BRIGHT BUT I DIDN'T COME ON A RAILROAD TRAIN
THERE SHE FOUND A DOUBLE GUARD POSTED
THE WARRIORS CONSISTED OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN EQUALLY DIVIDED AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO PROVIDE UNIFORMS FOR THEM BECAUSE THEIR REGULAR PINK CLOTHING WAS A DISTINCTIVE UNIFORM IN ITSELF
WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS TROUBLE PRETTY SOON TRUST TO US MATE ADDED CAP'N BILL
THEY MARCHED TO THEIR CHAIRS AND SEATED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE CRUEL SCENE THEIR FATHER WAS ABOUT TO ENACT AND CAP'N BILL BOWED TO THEM POLITELY AND SAID
HE HAD NOT MOVED FROM HIS POSITION WHEN THE UMBRELLA STARTED BACK
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN POUNCED PRINCESS INDIGO WITH A YELL OF ANGER
THAT WOULD INDEED BE VERY WRONG
TROT TOOK SOME FROM THE BASKET
THE ARRIVAL OF THE PINKIES GAVE THEM SOMETHING NEW TO TALK ABOUT SO THEY HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS AND ALONG THE CORRIDORS SO AS TO GAIN THE COURTYARD AND TAKE PART IN THE EXCITING SCENES
THE KING COUGHED AGAIN AND TURNED A BIT BLUER
WHEN THE OPPOSING FORCES CAME TOGETHER HOWEVER AND THE BLUESKINS PUSHED THEIR POINTS AGAINST THE PINKIES THE WEAPONS WHICH HAD BEEN ENCHANTED BY ROSALIE BEGAN TO WHIRL IN SWIFT CIRCLES--SO SWIFT THAT THE EYE COULD SCARCELY FOLLOW THE MOTION
LOOKING OUT HE FOUND THAT A FEW FEET BELOW THE WINDOW WAS THE BROAD WALL THAT RAN ALL AROUND THE PALACE GARDENS
IT MUST BE JUS ELEGANT TO HAVE A MAGIC UMBREL CAP'N BILL COUGHED
BUT CAP'N BILL WAS A PHILOSOPHER IN HIS WAY AND HAD LEARNED TO ACCEPT ILL FORTUNE CHEERFULLY
HOW UNLADYLIKE CRIED SAPPHIRE
TO TALK AND GRUMBLE I PREFER REPLIED THE PARROT DOLEFULLY
I HAVE NO POWER OVER THE FROGS ROSALIE ANSWERED
NO SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE
NEVER MIND SAID CAP'N BILL
DO YOU S'POSE TROT YOUR MOTHER WOULD LET ME STAY HERE ALL NIGHT COURSE SHE WOULD ANSWERED TROT
BUT THEY'RE COWARDS I'M SURE DECLARED THE BOY
THE BOOLOOROO STAMPED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM MUTTERING THREATS AND DECLARING CAP'N BILL SHOULD BE PATCHED WHETHER TIGGLE WAS FOUND OR NOT AND WHILE THEY WAITED TROT TOOK TIME TO MAKE AN INSPECTION OF THE PLACE WHICH SHE NOW SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
WHY DO THEY CALL THIS AN ISLAND ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
YOU'LL DO MORE THAN THAT OR I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED ROARED THE ANGRY BOOLOOROO
I KNOW REPEATED BUTTON-BRIGHT
I CAN'T FIGGER HOW BOTH O YOU CAN HOLD ON TO THE HANDLE O THAT UMBREL TROT'S FACE FELL
WHO KNOWS WE KNOW ANSWERED CAP'N BILL HASTILY
PRESENTLY THE SMOKE CLEARED AWAY WHEN THEY ALL SAW SEATED WITHIN THE CHAIR ROSALIE THE WITCH
GUESS AS YOU'RE A STRANGER MY LAD BUTTON-BRIGHT NODDED
THEN THEY SAW DANCING GAILY UPON THE ARCH A SCORE OF BEAUTIFUL MAIDENS DRESSED IN FLEECY ROBES OF RAINBOW TINTS WHICH FLUTTERED AROUND THEM LIKE CLOUDS
SO THE WITCH WOKE HER UP AND WENT BACK TO THE PALACE TO TELL TROT OF HER FAILURE
SHALL I ASSIST YOU TO PUT ONE ON NO ANSWERED TROT I GUESS I CAN MANAGE IT ALONE WHEN SHE WITHDREW TO THE LITTLE CHAMBER THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER BEGAN CONVERSING WITH THE WITCH WHOM SHE URGED TO STAY WITH THE NEW QUEEN AND PROTECT HER AS LONG AS SHE RULED THE PINK COUNTRY
I KNOW A HOUSE WHERE I CAN HIDE SO SNUGLY THAT ALL THE BOOLOOROO'S SOLDIERS CANNOT FIND ME ALL RIGHT SAID TROT
SCARCELY DARING TO BREATHE FOR FEAR OF AWAKENING THE TERRIBLE MONARCH THE BOY SEARCHED IN THE ROYAL POCKETS UNTIL HE FOUND A BLUE-GOLD KEY ATTACHED TO A BLUE-GOLD CHAIN
ILLUSTRATION BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT BOTH THOUGHT CAP'N BILL'S INVENTION VERY CLEVER
THEN BETWEEN THEM THEY GOT HIM UPON HIS FEET AND LED HIM AWAY PAYING NO ATTENTION TO POOR TIGGLE WHO WHINED TO BE RELEASED SO HE COULD FIGHT IN THE WAR
BUT THE UMBRELLA WASN'T THERE EITHER
SO SHE MOUNTED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AND THINKING SHE WOULD BE LIKELY TO FIND CAP'N BILL IN THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE SHE WENT THERE AND TRIED THE DOOR
THAT IS CONSIDERED AN IMPERTINENT QUESTION IN SKY ISLAND HE ANSWERED
HE HAD PROVED TO BOTH TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT HE HAD TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HOWEVER MARVELOUS HIS TALE HAD SEEMED TO THEM
JUST THEN THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A SWIFT FLAPPING OF WINGS AND A VOICE CRIED IN SHRILL TONES
THE GRASS WAS A SOFT PINK THE TREES WERE PINK ALL THE FENCES AND BUILDINGS WHICH THEY SAW IN THE NEAR DISTANCE WERE PINK--EVEN THE GRAVEL IN THE PRETTY PATHS WAS PINK
THE TERRIBLE TEETH CAME TOGETHER AND BURIED THEMSELVES IN THE PILLOW AND THEN MR WOLF FOUND HE COULD NOT PULL THEM OUT AGAIN--BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS STUFFED FULL
BUT HE RESOLVED TO TAKE THIS CHANCE
THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT IN AN INSTANT AND THEN THE ELEPHANT TURNED ITS HEAD AND LOOKED AT BUTTON-BRIGHT AND AT ONCE TROTTED INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE FOG
IT MOVED SLOWLY AT FIRST BUT GRADUALLY INCREASED ITS SPEED
BUT IF ANYONE SHOULD SEE YOU YOU WOULD BE CAPTURED I'LL RISK THAT SAID THE CHILD EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF GAINING THE SIDE OF CAP'N BILL IN THIS ADVENTUROUS WAY
SHE WAS EXQUISITELY FAIR DAINTY AS A LILY AND GRACEFUL AS A BOUGH SWAYING IN THE BREEZE
OUR WAY IS BEST
THE LITTLE BLUE DOG DASHED AT INDIGO AND BIT HER RIGHT ANKLE WHILE THE BLUE CAT SCRATCHED HER LEFT LEG WITH ITS CLAWS AND THE PARROT FLEW UPON HER SHOULDER AND PECKED HER EAR
IT'S A FACT SAID THE KING
I WENT TO A HOUSE AND ASKED A WOMAN FOR SOMETHING TO EAT AND SHE GAVE ME ALL I WANTED AND ADVISED ME TO GO STRAIGHT HOME BEFORE MY MOTHER WORRIED ABOUT ME
IF ANYONE COMES TO OUR COUNTRY TO VISIT US WE ALWAYS TREAT EM DECENT YOUR COUNTRY EXCLAIMED THE BOOLOOROO LOOKING AT THEM MORE CAREFULLY AND SEEMING INTERESTED IN THEIR APPEARANCE
THE AIR WERE MADE FOR THE BIRDS AN'--AN MUSKEETERS AN AN FLYIN'-FISHES ADDED TROT
THE PARROT MADE QUITE A LONG SPEECH FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE ARCH WHERE POLYCHROME STOOD AND THEN BACK TO CAP'N BILL'S SHOULDER
CAN'T YOU MAKE THE FROGS LET US THROUGH INQUIRED THE BOY
IN ALL THE PLACE THERE WAS BUT ONE STREET--A CIRCULAR ONE THAT STARTED AT THE GATE AND WOUND LIKE A CORKSCREW TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY
IT'S A FINE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND THE ONLY THING I OBJECT TO IS ELECTING THE BOOLOOROO FOR ONLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL COME BACK BUT YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT AN NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE OR I'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE YOU SORRY FOR IT
I'M HIS DAUGHTER AND I'LL RULE THE KINGDOM YOU WON'T SCREAMED COBALT
HE WAS SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID
I SAID I WANTED TO GO TO SKY ISLAND
TAKE IT AWAY AT ONCE BUT WE CAN'T EXPLAINED TROT
LET'S DO IT QUEEN TROT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD IDEA ADDED BUTTON-BRIGHT
FINDING HIMSELF FREE HE TURNED AND ASSAULTED THE SOLDIERS BUTTING THEM SO FIERCELY THAT THEY TUMBLED DOWN IN BUNCHES AND AS SOON AS THEY COULD RISE AGAIN RAN FRANTICALLY FROM THE ROOM AND ALONG THE CORRIDORS AS IF A FIEND WAS AFTER THEM
IF ANY OF THE NATIVES OF THE BLUE COUNTRY SHOULD EVER BREAK THROUGH THE FOG BANK THEY MUST BE DRIVEN BACK WITH SHARP STICKS HAVE YOU READ THIS LAW TOURMALINE YES SAID THE QUEEN
WHO HAS STOLEN MY GOLDEN KEY AND THEN THERE FOLLOWED SHOUTS OF SOLDIERS AND GUARDS AND SERVANTS AND THE RAPID PATTERING OF FEET WAS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE PALACE
WHERE DO YOU KEEP THE MENAGERIE OUR PETS ARE IN OUR BOUDOIRS SAID INDIGO HARSHLY
POLYCHROME STOOPED TO KISS TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT GAVE CAP'N BILL A CHARMING SMILE AND ROSALIE THE WITCH A FRIENDLY NOD OF FAREWELL
TROT FELT LITTLE DROPS OF MOISTURE STRIKING HER FACE AND KNEW HER CLOTHING WAS GETTING DAMP AND SOGGY
WHERE'S TIGGLE
YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO ANGER THE BOOLOOROO OR HE MAY DO YOU A MISCHIEF
YOU'RE SAFER IN THE PALACE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE SAID THE MAJORDOMO FOR THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND AND HERE THE SERVANTS AND SOLDIERS DARE NOT INJURE YOU FOR FEAR OF THE BOOLOOROO HE PLACED TROT AND HER SIX PETS--WHICH FOLLOWED HER WHEREVER SHE WENT--IN ONE ROOM AND CAP'N BILL IN ANOTHER AND TOOK BUTTON-BRIGHT AWAY WITH HIM TO SHOW THE BOY THE WAY TO THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER
HE PROVED TO BE CORRECT AND WHEN THEY CAME NEARER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES FLYING OVER THE WAVES OF THE OCEAN
I THINK IT WILL BE BEST FOR US TO GO BACK TO OUR OWN COUNTRY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SUGGESTED ROSALIE THE WITCH
HALT CRIED THE GUARD FIERCELY
THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT GHIP-GHISIZZLE DID NOT WANT TO MARRY ANY OF THEM FOR THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT WHEN IT WAS AGREED WHO SHOULD HAVE HIM THEY WOULD ASK THEIR FATHER TO FORCE THE MAN TO MARRY
I KNOW NOW DO YOU ASKED CAP'N BILL DOUBTFULLY
THEN I'LL BET YOU FOUR BUTTON-HOLES THEY DON'T
THEN HIS FIRST FLIGHT WAS SHOWN AND AFTERWARD HIS TRIP ACROSS THE UNITED STATES UNTIL HE LANDED ON THE BLUFF WHERE TROT SAT
IT MADE A PATH THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THE HEAVY BLACK CLOUD AT LAST AND CARRIED ITS PASSENGERS INTO A MISTY BILLOWY BANK OF WHITE WHICH SEEMED AS SOFT AND FLEECY AS A LADY'S VEIL
THEY HALTED A LITTLE WAY FROM OUR ADVENTURERS AND ONE OF THE WOMEN MUTTERED IN A HORRIFIED VOICE
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE CORRIDOR AND EVIDENCE OF SCUFFLING AND STRUGGLING
AT ONCE THEY ALL RUSHED OUT TO THE ALLEY AND BEGAN DIGGING IN THE RUBBISH HEAP
ALTHOUGH THIS HALF OF SKY ISLAND WAS NO LARGER THAN THE BLUE COUNTRY BEING NO MORE THAN TWO MILES SQUARE IT HAD SEVERAL HUNDRED INHABITANTS
A QUEEN HAS SOME DUTIES YOU KNOW AND AS LONG AS I'M QUEEN HERE I'VE GOT TO LIVE UP TO THE PART WHAT HAS TO BE DID MATE INQUIRED CAP'N BILL
TAKE ME TO CHICAGO I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO CHICAGO BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST PLACE I THOUGHT OF AND SO I SAID IT
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WELL REPAID FOR THE SPLENDOR OF THE RISING SUN WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO THAT OF THE SETTING SUN
THEN AFTER THE CITY HAD QUIETED DOWN AGAIN SHE LAY UPON THE BED WITHOUT UNDRESSING AND WAS SOUND ASLEEP IN A MINUTE
BUT I'LL NEVER FORGET THE QUEEN OF SKY ISLAND AND I SEND MY LOVE TO YOU AND CAP'N BILL
WE WISH SO TOO
SHE HELD IN HER HAND A SLENDER STAFF TIPPED WITH A LUSTROUS PINK JEWEL
THAT'S WHY HE DON'T SAILOR ANY MORE
NEXT MORNING THE SEARCH FOR THE MAGIC UMBRELLA BEGAN IN EARNEST
CAP'N BILL EVEN VENTURED TO ENTER THE ROOMS OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WHO WERE BY THIS TIME SO THOROUGHLY ALARMED THAT THEY HAD BECOME MEEK AND MILD AS COULD BE
WELL THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE ANYHOW SAID CAP'N BILL AND INSTEAD OF WAITIN TO SEE WHAT'LL THEY DO I GUESS WE'LL JUS MARCH ON THE CITY AN ASK EM TO PLEASE SURRENDER SO HE RAISED THE LONG SHARP STICK WITH WHICH HE HAD ARMED HIMSELF AND SHOUTED
IN ONE PLACE--AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM--WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE-CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
BUT HER EYES ARE OF THAT DREADFUL BLUE TINT WHICH PREVAILS IN THE OTHER HALF OF SKY ISLAND WHILE HER HAIR IS A QUEER COLOR ALL UNKNOWN TO US
WHILE TROT WAS OBSERVING THIS DREADFUL MACHINE THE DOOR OPENED AND IN WALKED THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES ALL IN A ROW AND WITH THEIR CHINS UP AS IF THEY DISDAINED EVERYONE BUT THEMSELVES
THEN IF YOU NEED MY ADVICE OR TROT'S ADVICE--SHE'S A WISE LITTLE GIRL FER HER SIZE TROT IS--WE'LL FREELY GIVE IT AN BE GLAD TO HELP YOU THANK YOU REPLIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
AN THERE'S THE MAINLAND MATE CRIED CAP'N BILL EXCITEDLY POINTING TOWARD A DISTANT COAST
I'M SORRY
HOWEVER TROT HAD GONE SAFELY TO TOWN AND BACK AND HAD GREATLY ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE
SOME FOLKS THINK I'M STUPID
NO SOUND WAS HEARD BUT IT WAS EASY FROM THE GESTURES OF THE ACTORS FOR THE PINKIES TO FOLLOW ALL THE ADVENTURES OF THE STRANGERS IN THE BLUE COUNTRY
HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN
THIS SLAVE IS THE ROYAL BOOTBLUE SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE TO THE GUARD
THEN SHE SPRANG LIGHTLY UPON THE ARCH OF THE RAINBOW AND WAS GREETED BY THE BEVY OF DANCING LAUGHING MAIDENS WHO WERE HER SISTERS
BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD ALREADY HOOKED THE ROPES TO THE ELEPHANT-TRUNK HANDLE SO THAT WHEN THE CAPTAIN CARRIED AWAY THE UMBRELLA HE DRAGGED AFTER HIM FIRST THE DOUBLE SEAT THEN CAP'N BILL'S SEAT WHICH WAS FASTENED TO IT AND FINALLY THE LUNCH-BASKET WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO THE LOWER SEAT
THAT WILL BE FINE I SEE YOU HAVE ANOTHER RING ON YOUR HAND SAID ROSALIE AND I PERCEIVE IT IS ENCHANTED IN SOME WAY
THEY HAD NOT ADVANCED FAR INTO THE DEEP FOG WHEN THEY WERE HALTED BY A QUEER BARRIER CONSISTING OF A LONG LINE OF GIGANTIC FROGS CROUCHING SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT NO PINKIE COULD SQUEEZE BETWEEN THEM
TROT STANDING BACK IN THE ROOM THREW A SOFA PILLOW THAT CAUGHT THE PRINCESS ON THE SIDE OF HER HEAD
ILLUSTRATION THEN CLIMB OVER ME--OR GO AROUND--I DON'T CARE WHICH MURMURED THE LIZARD
THE BOY MUST GO FOR THE KING'S SHOES AND BLUE THEM AND POLISH THEM AND THEN TAKE THEM BACK TO THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER
78-125373 ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION TO MY SISTER MARY LOUISE BREWSTER ILLUSTRATION A LITTLE TALK TO MY READERS WITH THE SEA FAIRIES MY BOOK FOR 1911 I VENTURED INTO A NEW FIELD OF FAIRY LITERATURE AND TO MY DELIGHT THE BOOK WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH APPROVAL BY MY FORMER READERS MANY OF WHOM HAVE WRITTEN ME THAT THEY LIKE TROT ALMOST AS WELL AS DOROTHY AS DOROTHY WAS AN OLD OLD FRIEND AND TROT A NEW ONE I THINK THIS IS VERY HIGH PRAISE FOR CAP'N BILL'S LITTLE COMPANION
I'M RIGHT HUNGRY JUS NOW SHE WAITED UNTIL THE SNUBNOSED SEXTETTE HAD PRANCED HAUGHTILY AWAY AND THEN SHE CAME OUT FOLLOWED BY ALL THE PETS AND FOUND HER WAY TO THE SERVANTS QUARTERS
LET'S FIND THE UMBREL AND GET HOME AS SOON AS WE CAN THAT SUITS ME THE SAILOR JOYFULLY EXCLAIMED AND THEN THE TWO BEGAN A CAREFUL SEARCH THROUGH THE PALACE
WELL SAID THE BOY I FOUND IT ALL OUT BY ACCIDENT
YOU ARE MY PRISONERS I GUESS NOT RETURNED CAP'N BILL AND REACHING OUT ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS THE SAILORMAN SUDDENLY GRASPED THE BOOLOOROO AROUND HIS LONG THIN NECK AND SHOOK HIM UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY FLUTTERED LIKE A FLAG
WE DON'T PLAY SUCH NASTY TRICKS YELLED THE PARROT ANGRILY AND THIS CAUSED THE PINKIES TO SHRINK BACK IN ALARM FOR THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A PARROT BEFORE
BUT THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES DID NOT KNOW THAT
WE HAVE DECIDED THERE ARE BUT TWO THINGS FOR US TO DO
ILLUSTRATION A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE CHAPTER 3
ILLUSTRATION STOP IT
PLEASE SCUSE ME FOR A-SITTIN ON YOUR ROYAL TOES NOT KNOWIN AS YOUR TOES WERE THERE I WON'T EXCUSE YOU ROARED THE BOOLOOROO
I'M SORRY THE TRIP DIDN'T LAST LONGER THOUGH
BUT IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR MOTHER AND ME AN FOR CAP'N BILL SAID TROT
I'M GOING TO BE PATCHED TO TIGGLE HERE AS SOON AS THE BOOLOOROO RETURNS SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR A PATCHED MAN TO MARRY ANYONE
AND ALTHOUGH TROT RAN WITH THEM IN HER EAGERNESS TO SAVE HER FRIEND THE GATE WAS FOUND TO BE FAST BARRED AND SHE KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FORCE AN ENTRANCE INTO THE CITY
THIS IS A QUEER FREAK FOR OUR BOOLOOROO TO INDULGE IN BUT HE IS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING ABSURD
ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN HERE AS HONORED GUESTS OR TOSS THEM OVER THE BUSHES INTO THE SKY ROSALIE DURING TOURMALINE'S SPEECH HAD BEEN ATTENTIVELY EXAMINING THE FACES OF THE THREE EARTH PEOPLE
I DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT PERHAPS IT'S A LITTLE MORE RESPECTABLE YES
I HAVEN'T A FRIEND IN THE COUNTRY
THE SERVANTS WERE ALL RICHLY ATTIRED IN BLUE SILK LIVERIES AND THEY SEEMED DISPOSED TO RESENT THE FACT THAT THESE STRANGERS HAD BEEN ADDED TO THEIR RANKS
JUMP THE BEST JUMP THAT YOU KNOW DON'T--DON'T
FAST THROUGH THE CLOUD THE UMBRELLA SWEPT AND THEN SUDDENLY IT SAILED INTO A CLEAR BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH A GREAT AND GORGEOUS RAINBOW SPREAD ITS RADIANT ARCH
GO AND CAPTURE THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE YOU SEE AND BRING HIM HERE TO BE PATCHED TO CAP'N BILL SO THE CAPTAIN TOOK A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND WENT AWAY VERY SORROWFUL FOR HE DID NOT KNOW WHO WOULD BE THE VICTIM AND IF THE BOOLOOROO HAD NO FRIENDS THE CAPTAIN HAD PLENTY AND DID NOT WISH TO SEE THEM PATCHED
YOU SEE SAID CAP'N BILL THE SKY IS ALL AROUND US AN WE'RE HIGH UP
DON'T LET EM WIND AROUND YOUR BODIES OR YOU'RE DONE FOR HE TOLD THEM OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE BLUESKINS SO THEY WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY FACED THE ENEMY AND FOUND THEM SO DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE FROM THEMSELVES AND ALSO HE ASSURED THEM THAT THE PINKIES WERE SO MUCH THE BRAVER AND BETTER ARMED THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT THEY WOULD EASILY CONQUER
IF THE BLUE MAN ASTONISHED THE TRAVELERS THEY WERE NO LESS SURPRISED BY HIS SURROUNDINGS FOR LOOK WHERE THEY MIGHT EVERYTHING THEY BEHELD WAS OF THE SAME BLUE COLOR AS THE SKY ABOVE
THE TWO NATIONS WERE SO DIFFERENT IN ALL WAYS THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO AGREE AT ALL AND SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING QUARRELS AROSE AND THERE WAS FIGHTING BETWEEN THEM WHICH TROT PROMPTLY CHECKED
JUST THEN HE CAME OPPOSITE THE CAMP OF THE PINKIES AND DECIDED TO TRUST HIMSELF TO THE MERCIES OF HIS EARTH FRIENDS RATHER THAN BE MADE A PRISONER BY HIS OWN PEOPLE WHO WOULD OBEY THE COMMANDS OF THEIR DETESTED BUT GREATLY FEARED BOOLOOROO
A FEW MORE BOLD THAN THE OTHERS FOLLOWED ON AT THE TAIL OF THE PROCESSION AND SO PRESENTLY THEY ALL REACHED AN OPEN CIRCULAR PLACE IN THE EXACT CENTER OF THE PINK CITY
THEY INTERFERE WITH OUR COLOR SCHEME AND DO NOT HARMONIZE WITH OUR PEOPLE A MAN OF THE SUNRISE TRIBE ANSWERED
AT HER RIGHT WERE SEATED SIX MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SUNRISE TRIBE AND ON HER LEFT SIX MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SUNSET TRIBE AMONG THE LATTER BEING CORALIE
BECAUSE I'LL PROB'LY SPOIL YOU FOR A KING AN MEBBE FOR ANYTHING ELSE
I SEE HIM STILL--UP ON THAT HILL
WHO WILL GUARD THE TREASURE CHAMBER I AM TO TAKE YOUR PLACE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
THE BLUE DAWN WAS JUST BREAKING WHEN SHE OPENED HER EYES WITH A START OF FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE OVERSLEPT BUT SOON SHE FOUND THAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE PALACE WAS YET ASTIR
HERE IT IS AND HE PRESENTED THE LITTLE BLUE BOOK TO THE MAJORDOMO THE ONLY FRIEND THE ADVENTURERS HAD FOUND AMONG ALL THE BLUESKINS
YET THERE IS NO ONE IN SIGHT TROT THEN SAW THAT THE GUARDS WERE THE TWO PATCHED MEN JIMFRED JONESJINKS AND FREDJIM JINKSJONES WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TOGETHER QUITE CHEERFULLY
SO OFF I STARTED FOR THE CAR BUT I FOUND THE STREETS AWFUL MUDDY AND ONCE I STEPPED IN A MUD-HOLE WAY UP TO MY ANKLE
BUT HE CAN'T OBJECTED THE LITTLE GIRL
THE SOLDIERS WERE SECRETLY GLAD TO OBSERVE THIS BUT THE PRINCESSES WERE HIGHLY INDIGNANT
THAT WAS SOME MAGIC I GUESS SHE EXCLAIMED
HOW SILLY CRIED AZURE
IT'S A REG'LAR MIX-UP THAT'S WHAT IT'S MEANT TO BE EXPLAINED THE YOUNG OFFICER
I WOULD INDEED SAID HE
IF ANYONE DARES ENTER THIS ROOM WITHOUT MY PERMISSION SAID TROT I'LL PULL THIS CORD AND SLICE YOUR MASTER THAT ONCE WAS THE BOOLOOROO DON'T COME IN
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE
THERE WAS ONE WINDOW IN HIS ROOM AND THE PRISONER HAD MANAGED TO PUSH OPEN THE SASH WITH HIS KNEES
BUT CAN'T YOU EVER GET--GET--_UN_-PATCHED AGAIN IF THE BOOLOOROO WOULD CONSENT I THINK IT COULD BE DONE JIMFRED REPLIED
GLORIOUS CRIED THE BOOLOOROO WIPING THE TEARS OF MERRIMENT FROM HIS EYES
YOU DON'T MIX NECKTIES
BE BRAVE MY DEAR SHE SAID AND I AM SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND CAP'N BILL WITHOUT GETTING IN DANGER YOURSELF
NO SAID TROT
IT IS EVIDENT PANTED THE BOOLOOROO FACING HIS DEFEATED SOLDIERS WRATHFULLY THAT YOU ARE A PACK OF COWARDS WE BUT FOLLOWED YOUR OWN ROYAL EXAMPLE IN RUNNING REPLIED THE CAPTAIN
THE PINK BAND PLAYED AS LOUD AS IT COULD--IN ORDER THAT THE TRAVELERS MIGHT HEAR IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE--AND ROSALIE AND CORALIE AND TOURMALINE THREW KISSES TO THEIR VANISHING FRIENDS AS LONG AS THEY REMAINED IN SIGHT
HE CREPT CLOSER TO TROT AND TOOK HER HAND IN HIS OWN PRESSING IT TO GIVE THE LITTLE GIRL COURAGE
SHE HAD HOPED TO MARRY GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND BECOME QUEEN AFTER WHICH SHE COULD AFFORD TO LAUGH AT THEIR REPROACHES
WHY NOT ASSEMBLE AN ARMY MARCH THROUGH THE FOG BANK FIGHT AND CONQUER THE BOOLOOROO AND RECAPTURE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HOORAY SHOUTED CAP'N BILL POUNDING HIS WOODEN LEG ON THE FLOOR
WE'LL SLICE HIM IN TWO BEFORE WE DO THE SAME TO THE BILLYGOAT SO THEY SEIZED CAP'N BILL AND TIED HIM INTO THE FRAME SO THAT HE COULDN'T MOVE A JOT IN ANY DIRECTION
THEY'RE CALLED PARASHOOTS MATE
I THINK I NOW FULLY COMPREHEND THE MATTER SAID SHE AND SO I WILL CAST MY VOTE
BUT THEY HAD NO TIME TO CONSIDER THIS CHANGE BECAUSE THEY WERE STILL SHOOTING THROUGH THE AIR AND PRESENTLY--BEFORE THEY COULD THINK OF ANYTHING AT ALL--ALL THREE WERE ROLLING HEELS OVER HEAD ON THE SOFT GRASS OF A MEADOW
I HAVE SUMMONED YOU HERE THAT YOU MAY CAST THE DECIDING VOTE ADDED THE QUEEN
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK THAT MAGIC UMBRELLA HE ASKED THE MAJORDOMO
SO IT'S BOUT A MILE FROM MY HOUSE TO THE TOWN THE BOY SAT DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE FLAT ROCK
WE COULD MATE BUT WE WON'T ANSWERED CAP'N BILL
AH
NO YOUR MAJESTY HE REPLIED
HE'S JUS A COMMON BLUESKIN
BUT THE BOOLOOROO JERKED IT AWAY IN AN INSTANT AND STANDING UP HE HELD THE UMBRELLA BEHIND HIM AND LAUGHED ALOUD
THEY WERE SITTING ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOORWAY AND BOTH STOOD UP AS SHE APPROACHED
TELL THE BLUE PEOPLE WE ARE TO THROW OPEN THE GATES AND WELCOME THE PINKIES TO THE CITY WHERE EVERYBODY WILL JOIN IN A GRAND CELEBRATION
I KNOW AN A PATCHED MAN ON GUARD OUTSIDE CAP'N BILL REMINDED HIM
WHEN THE OLD SAILORMAN AT ONE TIME SPILLED SOME TEA ON THE TABLECLOTH TROT'S MOTHER FLEW ANGRY AND GAVE THE CULPRIT SUCH A TONGUE-LASHING THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS SORRY FOR HIM
THEY HAD THE ROYAL CHEF SERVE DINNER AT ONCE AND THEY ATE IT IN GREAT STATE SEATED IN THE ROYAL BANQUET HALL WHERE THEY WERE WAITED ON BY A HUNDRED SERVANTS
I THINK HE HAS GIVEN YOU THIS JOB SO HE CAN FIND FAULT WITH YOU AND HAVE YOU PUNISHED
DON'T BE AFRAID
THESE PLUMES WAVED GRACEFULLY IN THE AIR WITH EVERY MINCING STEP THE PRINCESSES TOOK
POOR BUTTON-BRIGHT DID NOT KNOW THAT LYING DISREGARDED BENEATH THAT VERY CABINET AT HIS SIDE WAS THE PRECIOUS UMBRELLA HE WAS SEEKING OR THAT HE WAS UNDERTAKING A DESPERATE ADVENTURE ALL FOR NOTHING
HER EXPRESSION WAS PATIENT AND RESIGNED AS SHE FACED HER AUDIENCE
THEY HAD READ OF AIRSHIPS BUT HERE WAS SOMETHING WHOLLY BEYOND THEIR COMPREHENSION
THE MOAN WAS REPEATED AND BEING CURIOUS THEY UNLOCKED THE DOOR--THE KEY HAVING BEEN LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE--AND ENTERED THE ROOM
ROSALIE'S SKIN IS JUST AS LIGHT A PINK AS MY OWN CONTINUED TOURMALINE
LET'ER GO MY LAD I WANT TO GO TO SKY ISLAND SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT TO THE UMBRELLA USING THE NAME TROT HAD GIVEN HIM
OH HERE COMES CAP'N BILL AS SHE GLANCED OVER HER SHOULDER
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT WHILE ALL THE PINKIES SEEMED TO THINK DEEPLY
THEY MOUNTED A FLIGHT OF THESE STEPS AND FROM THEIR ELEVATION PLAINLY SAW THE LOW MOUNTAIN WHERE THE ARCH OF PHINIS WAS LOCATED AND BEYOND THAT THE THICK BLUE-GRAY FOG BANK WHICH CONSTANTLY ROLLED LIKE BILLOWS OF THE OCEAN AND REALLY SEEMED FROM A DISTANCE QUITE FORBIDDING
THEN THE DRUMS BEAT AND THE BAND PLAYED AND AWAY MARCHED THE PINKIES TO CAPTURE THE BLUE CITY
THE MORE YOU GUESS I RATHER THINK YOU'LL KNOW THE LESS RETORTED THE PARROT
USUALLY THERE ARE ROWS OF THICK BUSHES SET CLOSE TO THE EDGE TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING OFF
MARCH IN AND CAPTURE THEM CAPTAIN
STEADILY YET WITH WONDERFUL SWIFTNESS THE END OF THE GREAT BOW DESCENDED UNTIL IT RESTED UPON THE PINK FIELD--ALMOST AT THE FEET OF THE LITTLE PARTY OF OBSERVERS
THE BOY NOW KNEW WHY HE COULD NOT FIND THE UMBRELLA IN THE TREASURE CHAMBER AND HE WAS PROVOKED TO THINK HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN QUITE CLOSE TO IT WITHOUT KNOWING IT WAS THERE
WELL FIND OUT
I WANT TO GO TO TROT'S HOUSE THE SIMPLE VILLAGERS COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE UMBRELLA SUDDENLY LIFTED THE TWO CHILDREN INTO THE AIR AND CARRIED THEM AWAY
PLEASE QUEEN TROT BEGGED GHIP-GHISIZZLE LET ME PATCH JUST THE BOOLOOROO
COME COMMANDED THE WOMAN WHO LED THE PARTY
YOU ARE ALREADY CONDEMNED TO SEVERE PUNISHMENT AND IF I HAVE ANY FURTHER TROUBLE WITH YOU YOU ARE LIABLE TO BE PATCHED WHAT'S BEING PATCHED INQUIRED THE GIRL
CAN FIND NO CANCER THERE YES WE CAN SIR MISTER CANCER SAID THE PARROT WITH A CHUCKLE
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THAT I'M FREE TO SAY AS I DON'T FRIEND SIZZLE THE BOOLOOROO IS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS NECTAR
CAN'T THEY BE DISCHARGED OF COURSE SAID TROT
AND SAY
I BOUGHT SOME BUNS AND MILK WITH MY TEN CENTS AND THEN I WALKED AROUND THE STREETS OF CHICAGO FOR A TIME AND AFTERWARD SLEPT ON A BENCH IN ONE OF THE PARKS
BUTTON-BRIGHT JAMMED THE SOFA-PILLOW INTO THE BRUTE'S MOUTH AND CROWDED IT IN AS HARD AS HE COULD
THE BOOLOOROO LAUGHED
BUT ALL THE PALACE IS AROUSED AND THE BOOLOOROO IS FURIOUS
TEARS CAME TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S EYES AND TO COMFORT HER THE BOY PROMISED TO TAKE HER TO THE VILLAGE NEXT MORNING WITH HIS MAGIC UMBRELLA SO SHE COULD EXCHANGE THE YARN FOR THE RIGHT COLOR
THE BLUE WOLF'S HEAD WAS FULLY AS BIG AS THAT OF A LION AND ITS WIDE JAWS WERE ARMED WITH ROWS OF LONG POINTED TEETH
FORTUNATELY THE SEATS AND THE LUNCH-BASKET WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE HANDLE--OR SO THEY THOUGHT--AND THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT THEIR QUICKLY STARTING ON THE JOURNEY HOME
SOME OF EM ARE PRETTY GOOD FELLOWS BUT NOT MANY
BY NO MEANS WAS THE PROMPT REPLY
BUT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE SOME OTHER ACQUAINTANCES IN SKY ISLAND HERE FOR INSTANCE IS BUTTON-BRIGHT WHO ONCE HAD AN ADVENTURE WITH DOROTHY IN OZ AND WITHOUT BUTTON-BRIGHT AND HIS MAGIC UMBRELLA YOU WILL SEE THAT THE STORY OF SKY ISLAND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
MOST CERTAINLY
AS THE HEADS OF THE FROGS WERE TURNED THE OTHER WAY TOWARD THE BLUE COUNTRY THE ARMY COULD NOT AT FIRST IMAGINE WHAT THE BARRIER WAS
WHEN SHE OPENED THE PARCEL SHE HAD BOUGHT AT THE VILLAGE IT WAS FOUND SHE HAD SELECTED THE WRONG COLOR OF YARN AND MRS GRIFFITH WAS SO PROVOKED THAT TROT'S SCOLDING WAS ALMOST AS SEVERE AS THAT OF CAP'N BILL
THE LITTLE BLUE DOG CAME TROTTING OUT OF INDIGO'S BOUDOIR AND CROWED LIKE A ROOSTER FOR ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE TROT HIS KEEN LITTLE NOSE SCENTED HER PRESENCE
BUT EITHER WAY THERE'S NOTHING SO DELICIOUS AS A PARSNIP
IT DID NOT RAIN AT ONCE AND THEY REACHED TOURMALINE'S WRETCHED HUT IN SAFETY
NOW FOLLOW ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO YOUR ROOMS HE LED THEM TO THE REAR OF THE PALACE WHERE HE GAVE THEM THREE SMALL ROOMS ON THE GROUND FLOOR EACH HAVING A BED IN IT
RUN TROT AN GET TWO SLICES O BREAD-AN'-BUTTER COMMANDED MRS GRIFFITH
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME AND HE SUDDENLY BROKE OFF AND LOOKED TOWARD THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE DISTANCE--"DIDN'T YOU SAY YOU LIVED OVER THERE HE INQUIRED
HOW STRANGELY LIGHT HER COLOR IS
WHILE THE ARMY WAS GETTING READY ROSALIE THE WITCH WENT TO THE CENTRAL EDGE OF THE FOG BANK AND FEARLESSLY ENTERED IT
SO THE LITTLE GIRL GOT UP AND FINDING A EWER OF WATER AND A BASIN UPON THE DRESSER WASHED HERSELF CAREFULLY AND THEN LOOKED IN A BIG MIRROR TO SEE HOW HER HAIR WAS
AT ONCE INDIGO SPRANG OUT OF BED AND RUSHED INTO THE CHAMBER OF COBALT WHICH ADJOINED HER OWN
BUT NOT ONE COULD REMEMBER HAVING SEEN ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE AN UMBRELLA
OF COURSE THE LONG-LEGGED BLUESKINS COULD RUN FASTER THAN POOR CAP'N BILL
TROT TRIED TO INTEREST THEM BY TELLING THEM THAT ON THE EARTH THE PEOPLE HAD BOTH THE SUN AND THE MOON AND LOVED THEM BOTH
MEANTIME CAP'N BILL HAD THE ARMY ASSEMBLED IN THE COURT OF THE STATUES WHERE QUEEN MAYRE APPEARED AND TOLD THE PINKIES THAT THE SAILORMAN WAS TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE EXPEDITION AND ALL MUST OBEY HIS COMMANDS
YOU ARE TO PERMIT NO ONE TO ENTER OR TO LEAVE THE APARTMENTS BUT--GOOD GRACIOUS EXCLAIMED THE SURPRISED JIMFRED
MY PEOPLE SEEM TO DISLIKE STRANGERS SAID THE MAJORDOMO THOUGHTFULLY AND THAT SURPRISES ME BECAUSE YOU ARE THE FIRST STRANGERS THEY HAVE EVER SEEN
SO DID WE REPLIED THE OTHER
I HAVE SEARCHED THROUGH THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS AND FOUND NOTHING ABOUT FOREIGN PEOPLE ENTERING OUR LAND
IT ISN'T OUR FAULT WE'RE STILL HERE AN I'M FREE TO SAY YOU'RE A VERY DIS'GREE'BLE AN HORRID LOT OF PEOPLE WITH NO MANNERS TO SPEAK OF OR YOU'D TREAT US NICELY NO IMPERTINENCE CRIED INDIGO SAVAGELY
IT'D GET PRETTY TIRESOME MATE AFTER YOU'D HAD A FEW QUARRELS WITH THE PINKIES FOR THEY EXPEC THEIR QUEEN TO BE AS POOR AS POVERTY AN NEVER HAVE ANY FUN IN LIFE YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT FOR LONG I'M SURE ADDED BUTTON-BRIGHT SERIOUSLY
ONE OF THOSE PRESENT HOWEVER SHOWED NO ESPECIAL ENMITY TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL AND THIS BLUESKIN ATTRACTED THE BOY'S NOTICE BECAUSE HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO STRANGE
WILL YOU TAKE THE PARROT HOME WITH YOU TROT ASKED CAP'N BILL
YOUR LEGS ARE TOO SHORT AND YOUR NECK IS NOTHING AT ALL
THESE TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS WERE CORRECTED BY THE ETEXT TRANSCRIBER
BUT I DON'T LIKE HER
BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THEY HAD FOR QUICKLY THEY DOVE INTO ANOTHER BANK OF CLOUDS AND THE RAINBOW DISAPPEARED
YOURS MAY LOOK A HEAP BETTER SIR BUT--I'LL KEEP THIS ONE IF YOU PLEASE WHERE DID YOU GET IT ASKED TROT APPEARING JUST THEN WITH A PLATE OF BREAD-AND-BUTTER
WHEN IT WAS NOT ROARING THE CREATURE WAS SO SOFT AND FLUFFY THAT TROT PLAYED WITH IT AND FONDLED IT A LONG TIME AFTER IT HAD FINISHED EATING AND THE RABBIT PLAYED WITH THE CAT AND THE DOG AND THE LAMB AND DID NOT SEEM A BIT AFRAID OF THE PARROT OR THE PEACOCK
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL TAKE ALL O YOU YOUNG LADY AN THE CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T DO IT THEN THEY HAD HALTED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSHES AND NOW THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AN IMMENSE RAINBOW
YOU DID NOT DISTURB ME SO THERE IS NO HARM DONE WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE EXPLAINED TROT
THE PINKIES DID NOT RUN LIKE RABBITS BUT FORMED A SOLID LINE AND KNELT DOWN WITH THEIR LONG SHARP STICKS POINTED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE BLUESKINS THE OTHER ENDS BEING SET FIRMLY UPON THE GROUND
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE SUNRISE TRIBE AND THE SUNSET TRIBE CHAPTER 15
MOST OF THE PEOPLE EARN THEIR LIVING BY FISHING
BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO STEP ON MY LEGS
THE BLUESKINS ARE BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN THE PINKIES AND IF THEY HAVE SHARP STICKS WHICH ARE LONGER THAN OURS THEY WILL SURELY DEFEAT US I HAVE ONE MAGIC CHARM SAID ROSALIE THOUGHTFULLY THAT WILL SAVE OUR ARMY
WOULDN'T IT BE HORRIBLE TO BE OBLIGED TO LOOK UPON SUCH A SIGHT
I'M NOT PRETTY BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT
I'LL ALWAYS BE QUEEN OF SKY ISLAND BUT THE PINK AND BLUE COUNTRIES MUST EACH HAVE A RULER
WE ARE NOW READY TO VOTE AS TO YOUR FATE SAID THE PRETTY QUEEN TO THEM
ALL THE PALACES I'VE SEEN WERE SPLENDID A SPLENDID PALACE EXCLAIMED ONE OF THE PINKIES AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN AMAZEMENT AND SEEMED TO DOUBT THAT THEIR EARS HAD HEARD ARIGHT
BUT WHEN TOURMALINE ARRIVED AT THE PALACE DRESSED ALL IN LOVELY FLUFFY ROBES AND WITH A DAINTY PINK PLUME IN HER PINK HAIR SHE BEGGED MOST EARNESTLY NOT TO BE MADE THE QUEEN AGAIN
RHYMES COME FROM YOUR HEAD BUT REAL PO'TRY FROM YOUR HEART AN WHETHER THE BLUE PARROT HAS A HEART OR NOT HE'S SURE GOT A HEAD HAVING DECIDED NOT TO VENTURE INTO THE ARCH OF PHINIS THEY AGAIN STARTED ON THIS TIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY STRAIGHT TOWARD THE FOG BANK WHICH HUNG LIKE A BLUE-GRAY CLOUD DIRECTLY ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND
YOU ARE MY PRISONERS BEG PARDING YOUR MAJESTY SAID CAP'N BILL BUT YOU'RE TAKIN A GOOD DEAL FOR GRANTED
IF YOUR OL UMBREL HADN'T BEEN SO OBSTINATE WE COULD HAVE SAVED THAT BOAT NEVER MIND SAID TROT BRISKLY
THE PARROT ON HER SHOULDER KEPT INTERRUPTING HER CONTINUALLY FOR THE MENTION OF THE BOOLOOROO SEEMED TO MAKE THE BIRD FRANTIC WITH RAGE
WHEN THE LITTLE GIRL CAME BACK AND TOOK HER SEAT BUTTON-BRIGHT SAID
VILLAINS HE SHOUTED GO OUT AND ARREST THE FIRST LIVING THING YOU MEET AND WHOEVER IT PROVES TO BE WILL BE INSTANTLY PATCHED TO CAP'N BILL THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS HESITATED TO OBEY THIS ORDER
THEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HIS BONDS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND HE RUBBED HIS EYES ONCE MORE TO MAKE SURE HE WAS NOT DREAMING
HE KNOWS EVER'THING NOT EVER'THING OBJECTED THE BOY
THE NEIGHBORING HOUSES ALSO HAD THEIR BALCONIES AND ROOFS FILLED WITH PEOPLE FOR IT SEEMED ALL THE SUNSET TRIBE CAME OUT EVERY NIGHT TO WITNESS THE SETTING OF THE SUN
IT DESTROYS OUR INDIVIDUALITY AND MAKES US COMPLEX CREATURES SO IT'S THE WORST PUNISHMENT THAN CAN BE INFLICTED IN SKY ISLAND OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT ALARMED AT SUCH DREADFUL BUTCHERY
SOLDIERS USED TO BE CALLED KNIGHTS BUT THAT WERE IN THE DARK AGES I GUESS AN LIKELY NOUGH BUTT'N-BRIGHT'S GREAT-GRAN'THER WERE THAT SORT OF A KNIGHT BUT HE SAID AN ARABIAN KNIGHT PERSISTED TROT
THIS IS THE KING'S NEW BOOTBLUE A STRANGER WHO HAS LATELY ARRIVED HERE SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE INTRODUCING THE BOY TO THE PATCHED MAN
NOTHING CAN KILL US UNTIL WE'VE LIVED TO THE LAST DAY OF OUR APPOINTED LIVES
AND THE ROPE LADDER SHE HAD USED WOULD HELP THE SAILOR DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE WALL
IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES--AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
TRY IT AND SEE ANSWERED TROT BITING INTO AN APPLE HERSELF
I DO NOT WAS THE REPLY
HAVEN'T YOU WE HAVE MATE WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF IT OBSERVED BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEY DID NOT STOP TO ARGUE ANY LONGER BUT ALL THREE STEPPED OUT OF THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THE STREET WHERE THEY FIRST CLASPED HANDS SO THEY WOULD NOT GET SEPARATED IN THE DARK AND THEN RAN AS SWIFTLY AS THEY COULD DOWN THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED AT THIS HOUR BY THE CITIZENS
BUT NOW YOU ARE NO LONGER QUEEN OF THE PINKIES TOURMALINE THOSE ASSEMBLED WERE SO STARTLED BY THIS STATEMENT THAT THEY GAZED AT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IN ASTONISHMENT FOR A TIME
THESE WERE STARING IN BEWILDERMENT AT CAP'N BILL WHO HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO THEM BY CAPTAIN ULTRAMARINE
BEHOLD IN THE PERSONAGE YOU HAVE INJURED THE MIGHTY QUITEY RIGHTY BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES HERE HE STRUTTED AROUND IN A VERY POMPOUS MANNER AND WAGGED HIS LITTLE HEAD CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THEM
IT WON'T MATTER WHO SEES ME NOW SHE REMARKED AN I WANT EM TO KNOW THAT YOU AN ME CAP'N ARE RUNNING THIS KINGDOM
HE WANTS US TO FOLLOW SAID THE BOY GASPING IN AMAZEMENT AT THIS WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION
BUT IF YOU MAKE A NOISE AND WAKEN HIS MAJESTY THE CHANCES ARE YOU'LL GET YOURSELF PATCHED I'LL BE QUIET PROMISED THE BOY
WELL IF YOU MANAGE TO ENTER THE TREASURE CHAMBER BE SURE TO BRING ME THE BOOK OF RECORDS
THEIR SKIRTS PREVENTED THEIR LONG LEGS FROM APPEARING AS GROTESQUE AS DID THOSE OF THE MEN BUT THEIR NECKS WERE SO THIN AND LONG THAT THE RUFFLES AROUND THEM ONLY MADE THEM SEEM THE MORE ABSURD
TROT TOOK THE EMPTY LUNCH-BASKET AND BUTTON-BRIGHT HELD FAST TO THE PRECIOUS UMBRELLA
OUR BOOLOOROO IS IN AN UGLY MOOD TO-NIGHT
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU SAID HE BUT NOTHING WILL EVER INDUCE ME TO MARRY ONE OF THOSE SNUBNOSES THEY'RE VERY PRETTY--FOR BLUESKINS SAID TROT
AND I'M ITS RULER--ITS KING--ITS SOLE ROYAL POTENTATE AND DICTATOR
THE TOWN IS HALF A MILE FROM HERE AN MY HOUSE IS ALMOST A HALF MILE THE OTHER WAY
THEN TROT CAME UP AND TOOK HIS HAND THE TOUCH AT ONCE RENDERING HER VISIBLE TO HIM
SHE AND CAP'N BILL HAD BEEN EVERY PLACE THAT WAS DESIRABLE AND NEAR BY BUT TO-DAY THEY DIDN'T WANT A NEAR-BY SPOT
WE'D TUMBLE BUT WE WOULDN'T FLY THEY'D TAKE A FALL AND THAT IS ALL OBSERVED THE PARROT FLUTTERING ITS WINGS
IS THE BLUE CITY CAPTURED NOT YET SHE REPLIED
I DUNNO AS I'D LIKE IT PROTESTED CAP'N BILL NERVOUSLY
THE PEOPLE HAVE THE WEALTH AND HONOR FOR IT IS THEIR DUE
WE'RE IN THE SKY ALL RIGHT SAID THE GIRL
WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THEM SUCCESSFULLY IS A NUMBER OF SHARP STICKS WHICH ARE LONGER THAN THEIR OWN TRUE--TRUE EXCLAIMED THE BOOLOOROO ENTHUSIASTICALLY
AND IT IS PINK TOO WHICH IS IN HER FAVOR
ONE SIDE OF HIS BLUE HAIR WAS CURLY AND THE OTHER HALF STRAIGHT
WE CAN'T TELL ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL WE GET THERE BUTTON-BRIGHT ANSWERED
BY THE WAY ONE OF MY LITTLE CORRESPONDENTS HAS SUGGESTED THAT I PRINT MY ADDRESS IN THIS BOOK SO THAT THE CHILDREN MAY KNOW WHERE LETTERS WILL REACH ME
BUT AS NO RESPONSE CAME TO THIS MEAN ACTION THE BOOLOOROO FINALLY LOOKED INTO THE ROOM ONLY TO FIND HE HAD BEEN PULLING ON A LEG OF THE COUCH AND THAT HIS PRISONER HAD ESCAPED
FINALLY SHE ENTERED THE KING'S OWN SLEEPING CHAMBER AND FOUND THE BOOLOOROO IN BED AND ASLEEP WITH A FUNNY NIGHTCAP TIED OVER HIS EGG-SHAPED HEAD
NONE OF THE SNUBNOSED ONES DARED ENTER THE ROOM WHERE THE GIRL WAS BUT THEY CALLED THROUGH A CRACK IN THE DOOR FOR TROT TO COME OUT INSTANTLY
OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SUCH A PLACE BECAUSE YOU CAME FROM THERE BUT THE EARTH IS NEVER VISIBLE IN OUR SKY NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT CAUSE IT'S UNDER YOUR ISLAND
EVEN THE GUARDS HAD GONE TO SLEEP BY THIS TIME AND WERE ADDING THEIR SNORES TO THE SNORES OF THE OTHER INHABITANTS OF THE ROYAL PALACE
I'LL MARK YOUR OBSTINATE FACE WITH MY FINGER NAILS AND I SAID TURQUOISE PASSIONATELY WILL POUND YOUR HEAD WITH A BROOMSTICK I'LL SHAKE HIM TILL HIS TEETH RATTLE SHRIEKED SAPPHIRE
THE UMBRELLA STARTED PROMPTLY
OF COURSE ANSWERED ROSALIE
AT EVERY FEW STEPS SOME OF THESE WOULD TRIP UP THE CAPTAIN AND CAUSE HIM TO TAKE A TUMBLE BUT AS HE HAD ONLY FIVE MINUTES TIME IN WHICH TO PERFORM HIS ERRAND HE WOULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND DASH ALONG THE PATH UNTIL A BOARD OR THE BASKET TRIPPED HIM AGAIN
THIS MARCH THROUGH THE UNKNOWN FOG BANK TO FIGHT THE UNKNOWN BLUESKINS AROUSED THEM TO ENTHUSIASM AND ALTHOUGH THE RESULT OF THE EXPEDITION COULD NOT BE FORETOLD AND SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST CERTAIN TO GET HURT THEY DID NOT HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE THE WAR
THIS UMBRELLA GOES FASTER THAN ANY TRAIN EVER DID
AND IF ONE SHOULD STEP OFF THE EDGE HE WOULD GO TUMBLING INTO THE GREAT SKY AND NEVER BE HEARD OF AGAIN IS THERE A FENCE AROUND THE EDGE ASKED TROT
OH IT'S GOT AN AWFUL HARD NAME TO PERNOUNCE REPLIED THE GIRL SO CAP'N BILL AND I JUS CALL IT SKY ISLAND CAUSE IT LOOKS AS IF IT WAS HALF IN THE SKY
WE MERELY PASS AWAY HOW'S THAT ASKED THE SAILOR
I DON'T CARE
BUT I KNOW A FEW THINGS THAT ARE WONDERFUL
I'M NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERIN KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK SO THE PINKIES AND THE BLUES MARCHED SIDE BY SIDE INTO THE CITY AND THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING AND MUSIC AND DANCING AND FEASTING AND GAMES AND MERRYMAKING THAT LASTED FOR THREE FULL DAYS
HAVE YOU NEARLY FINISHED HE INQUIRED
WHY HE COULDN'T DO THAT OBSERVED THE KING WHO WAS TRYING TO REARRANGE THE RUFFLE AROUND HIS NECK
READY ASKED THE BOY
BUT THE UNIVERSE IS A BIG PLACE AN YOU CAN'T BE SURE OF WHAT'S IN IT TILL YOU'VE TRAVELED LIKE WE HAVE PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT MUSED THE BLUESKIN
IS NOT A SNUBNOSE THE HIGHEST MARK OF FEMALE BEAUTY IS IT ASKED THE GIRL
MY GUARDS ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED AND I DON'T MEAN TO LET YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT AGAIN UNTIL YOU ARE PATCHED SO CAP'N BILL AND THE BOOLOOROO HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER SIX BLUESKINS STANDING IN A ROW BACK OF THE SAILORMAN TO GRAB HIM IF HE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE
LET THE BOY LOOK AT ME IF HE WANTS TO
THESE POINTS TAKEN WITH HER LIGHT PINK SKIN AND SLENDER FORM RENDERED HER DISTINCTIVE AMONG THE PINKIES WHATEVER GOWN SHE MIGHT WEAR
THE RULER IS APPOINTED TO PROTECT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE AND HERE IN THE PINK COUNTRY I HAVE THE FULL POWER TO CARRY OUT THE LAWS
WHAT A LITTLE FOOL YOU ARE PERHAPS SAID TROT PAUSING AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN I GROW UP I'LL BE AS BIG A FOOL AS ANY OF YOU THEN SHE RAN AWAY TO ESCAPE ANOTHER SHAKING AND IN THE FIRST BOUDOIR SHE FOUND THE LITTLE BLUE DOG CURLED UP ON A BLUE CUSHION IN A CORNER
OF COURSE GHIP-GHISIZZLE DENIED TAKING THE BOOK BUT HE BECAME ALMOST AS NERVOUS AT ITS LOSS AS HAD THE BOOLOOROO
THE BLUE LAMB CAME TROTTING INTO THE ROOM AND TROT LEANED OVER AND PATTED THE PRETTY LITTLE ANIMAL
THE BOOLOOROO WAS LAUGHING AND DANCING AROUND IN FRONT OF THEM AS IF WELL PLEASED
WE JUS CALLED IT THAT CAUSE ITS RIGHT NAME IS TOO HARD TO SAY THAT'S THE WHOLE TROUBLE THEN RETURNED BUTTON-BRIGHT
WHAT BUTTON-BRIGHT SAID IS THE HONEST TRUTH--EVERY WORD OF IT BUT WE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT SKY ISLAND IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE UNIVERSE--MEANING OF COURSE OUR HALF OF IT THE BLUE COUNTRY IT MAY BE FOR YOU PERHAPS THE SAILOR STATED POLITELY AN I DON'T IMAGINE ANY ISLAND FLOATIN IN THE SKY IS ANY BIGGER
I'D FORGOTTEN THE PINKIES EXCLAIMED THE GIRL
SOME WERE LIKE HUGE SHIPS SOME LIKE FOREST TREES AND OTHERS PILED THEMSELVES INTO SEMBLANCES OF TURRETED CASTLES AND WONDERFUL PALACES
A POWERFUL RULER OUGHT TO BE RICH AND TO LIVE IN A SPLENDID PALACE
BUT AFORE WE STARTS ON SUCH A LONG JOURNEY S'POSE WE MAKE A LITTLE TRIAL TRIP ALONG THE COAST
IT ISN'T JUST ONE COUNTRY BUT A GOOD MANY COUNTRIES WE HAVE THREE COUNTRIES IN SKY ISLAND RETURNED THE WOMAN
BUT IT WAS SOON DISCOVERED THAT INDIGO HAD BEEN DECEIVING THEM AND KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE UMBRELLA
I SPY A PEACOCK'S EYE ON EVERY FEATHER--I WONDER WHY THE PEACOCK SOON CAME TO LOVE TROT AS MUCH AS THE OTHER BIRD AND ALL THE BEASTS DID AND IT SPREAD ITS TAIL AND STRUTTED AFTER HER INTO THE NEXT BOUDOIR--THE SIXTH ONE
MY SPERIENCE WITH BOYS IS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH BUT THINK THEY DO THAT'S TRUE HE ANSWERED
IT WAS A LONG JOURNEY AND ALL THE PINKIES WERE DRIPPING WATER FROM THEIR RAINCOATS AND THEIR LITTLE FAT LEGS WERE TIRED AND ACHING WHEN THE PINK GLOW SHOWING THROUGH THE FOG AT LAST ANNOUNCED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NEARING THE PINK COUNTRY
IT ISN'T A VERY PRETTY CABIN AND THE FURNITURE IS CHEAP AND COMMON BUT I'M SURE IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS WICKED MAN AND HIS FAMILY I'LL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD BOOLOOROO
THEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND IN CAME THE SOLDIERS DRAGGING A GREAT BLUE BILLYGOAT WHICH WAS DESPERATELY STRIVING TO GET FREE
I'D HEARD OF BUFFALO BUT I DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE IT WAS
A HUE AND CRY CAME FROM EVERY DIRECTION REACHING AS FAR AS THE PALACE
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET SAID THE BOOLOOROO
HIS MAJESTY LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO THROW BUT THE BOY SEIZED THE SHOES AND RAN AWAY RETURNING TO HIS OWN ROOM
NOW THEN SAID HE YOU CAN'T GET AWAY UNTIL I'M WILLING TO LET YOU GO
WHILE THEY QUARRELED IN ONE ROOM OF THE PALACE GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS IN DANGER OF BEING PATCHED IN ANOTHER ROOM
I GOT FRIGHTENED AND WAS AFRAID THE UMBRELLA DIDN'T HAVE ANY MAGIC LEFT SO TO TRY IT I SAID
WHAT NEXT QUEEN TROT HOLD HIM STEADY IN THE FRAME AND I'LL TIE HIM UP SHE REPLIED
AS THEY ENTERED THE GIRL SIGHED AND LAID DOWN HER WORK
I'LL RISK IT MATE ALTHOUGH I GUESS I'M AN OLD FOOL FOR TEMPTIN FATE BY TRYIN TO MAKE A BIRD O MYSELF
I'M GLAD OF IT CAUSE CAP'N BILL KNOWS EV'RYTHING
THE ONLY QUEER THING ABOUT HIM WAS HIS BIG UMBRELLA
THE TREASURE CHAMBER WAS HEAPED AND CROWDED WITH ALL THE RICHES THE BOOLOOROO HAD ACCUMULATED DURING HIS REIGN OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS
THIS IS ALMOST WORTH COMIN FOR CAP'N BUT NOT QUITE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT SADLY
NOW I'LL GO TO ONE END OF THE PASSAGE AND MAKE A NOISE SAID SHE
BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU ISN'T THERE A LAW TO COVER THIS CASE ASKED CORALIE
INDEED BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD NO DESIRE TO WAKEN THE BOOLOOROO WHOM HE FOUND SNORING LUSTILY WITH THE CURTAINS OF HIS HIGH-POSTED BED DRAWN TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
DO YOU THINK THE PINKIES COULD FIGHT THE BLUESKINS ASKED TROT
ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WERE FOUR OF THE NATIVES OF THE PINK COUNTRY
I'M GLAD YOU KNEW HER BUTTON-BRIGHT I WAS SURE SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO SAVE YOU REMARKED ROSALIE AND THAT WAS WHY I VOTED TO HAVE YOU THROWN OFF THE EDGE
IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED THE CORKSCREW WINDINGS OF THE STREET IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LONG JOURNEY TO THE OUTER EDGE OF THE PINK COUNTRY BUT TOURMALINE TOOK A SHORT CUT LEADING THEM THROUGH PRIVATE GARDENS AND EVEN THROUGH HOUSES SO THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALMOST A BEE LINE TO THEIR DESTINATION
SO THINGS ARE RUN AS I SAY AN I'VE MADE GHIP-GHISIZZLE BOOLOOROO IN YOUR PLACE
ALL RIGHT
ALL RIGHT
I'LL TIE ON THE LUNCH-BASKET ANSWERED THE SAILOR
IS THERE ANOTHER HALF TO SKY ISLAND YES
THEN TOURMALINE ASKED
THE PINKIES ARE REALLY A GREAT NATION AND THEY ARE PLEDGED TO OBEY YOUR COMMANDS
FINDING THEMSELVES HELPLESS AND BALKED OF THEIR REVENGE THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES FINALLY RECOVERED FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT AND SETTLED DOWN TO A PLEASANT SISTERLY QUARREL AS WAS THEIR CUSTOMARY AMUSEMENT
A FEARFUL PLACE IT MUST BE INDEED SAID THE BLUESKIN WITH A SHUDDER
ISN'T THIS THE PACIFIC OCEAN OF COURSE WHY OF COURSE HE ASKED
TROT HAD MANAGED BY THIS TIME TO STAND UP AND SHE PULLED THE BOARD OFF FROM CAP'N BILL
I'M QUITE SURE THE PRESENT BOOLOOROO HAS REIGNED THREE HUNDRED YEARS NEXT THURSDAY
FRIEND ROARED THE BOOLOOROO
THE SUNRISE TRIBE LIVED IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE PINK COUNTRY AND THE SUNSET TRIBE IN THE WEST HALF AND THERE WAS GREAT RIVALRY BETWEEN THEM AND SOMETIMES WARS
THEY WERE A NERVOUS RESTLESS PEOPLE AND THEIR EGG-SHAPED HEADS SET ON THE ENDS OF LONG THIN NECKS SEEMED SO GROTESQUE TO THE STRANGERS THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY FORBEAR LAUGHING AT THEM
YOU SURELY ARE ADDED CAP'N BILL
DON'T THAT PROVE SKY ISLAND IS A FAIRY COUNTRY AS I SAID OH I'VE KNOWN THAT ALL ALONG SAID THE BOY
BUT THE UMBRELLA IN HIS HANDS PROVED JUST AS COMMON AS ANY OTHER UMBRELLA MIGHT
INSTEAD OF A SILKEN GOWN FURBELOWED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS THEY HAD SEEN WOMEN WEAR IN THIS LAND TOURMALINE WAS DRESSED IN A SEVERELY PLAIN ROBE OF COARSE PINK CLOTH MUCH RESEMBLING BEDTICKING
HE'S BUSY AT PRESENT GUARDING THE TREASURE CHAMBER BUT I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM WHEN HE COMES BACK
IT CAN'T BE DONE NEVER MIND SAID CAP'N BILL
THE OLD SAILORMAN HAD REFILLED HIS PIPE AND LIGHTED IT AGAIN AND HE SMOKED THOUGHTFULLY AS HE PEGGED ALONG BESIDE THE CHILDREN
TIGGLE USED TO BE A SERVANT BUT HE ESCAPED AND RAN AWAY OH YES EXCLAIMED TROT
THE CASE IS DECIDED ANNOUNCED TOURMALINE IN A CLEAR COLD VOICE
THEN WE CAN ALL THREE RIDE ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO YES DO EXCLAIMED TROT
THE APPLE-DUMPLINGS FAT AND PINK WILL BE HERE QUICKER THAN A WINK TROT STARTED UP IN ALARM AND RUBBED HER EYES
HOW DARE YOU PEOPLE GIVE ORDERS IN MY PALACE
CAP'N BILL HAD DETERMINED TO FIGHT DESPERATELY FOR THEIR LIVES BUT HE WAS A SHREWD OLD SAILORMAN AND HE FOUND MUCH THAT WAS REASONABLE IN THE WITCH'S ASSERTION THAT FAIRIES WOULD PROTECT THEM
THERE'S A LOT MORE OF IT BUT I'VE FORGOTTEN THE REST THANK YOU SAID TROT
THE GUARD WAS NOW HOWLING AND CRYING FOR HELP
THE SKY COUNTRY IS CERTAINLY A REMARKABLE FAIRYLAND BUT AFTER READING ABOUT IT I AM SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT OUR OLD MOTHER EARTH IS A VERY GOOD PLACE TO LIVE UPON AND THAT TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE FORTUNATE TO GET BACK TO IT AGAIN
THEN WHILE THE PRINCESS SLEPT THE WITCH MADE HER TELL ALL SHE KNEW WHICH WASN'T A GREAT DEAL TO BE SURE
IF SHE HAPPENED TO LOSE HER HOLD AND LET GO IT'S GOOD-BYE TROT
RELEASE HIS MAJESTY AT ONCE CRIED INDIGO FROM THE CORRIDOR
SHE CALLED ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE PALACE TO HER AND QUESTIONED THEM CLOSELY
BUT HE CLAIMS IT IS ONLY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AND AS HE HOLDS THE ROYAL BOOK OF RECORDS UNDER LOCK AND KEY IN THE ROYAL TREASURY THERE IS NO WAY FOR US TO PROVE HE IS WRONG OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
HE'LL LOOK AFTER THIS END OF THE ISLAND HEREAFTER AN UNLESS I'M MUCH MISTAKEN HE'LL DO IT A HEAP BETTER THAN YOU DID THE FORMER BOOLOOROO GROANED
NAUGHTY NAUGH-TY BOO-LOO-ROO
BUT HE NOTICED THAT THE BLUE WOLF HAD FINALLY SEIZED AN EDGE OF THE SOFA-PILLOW IN ITS SHARP CLAWS AND WAS STRUGGLING TO PULL THE THING OUT OF HIS MOUTH
THIS WILL FIX US ALL RIGHT I'M SURE WHY I HAVE DONE NOTHING RETURNED POLYCHROME SMILING UPON HIM
I'LL REFORM
WE'RE GETT'N A LONG WAY FROM HOME AND SEE HOW THE CLOUDS ARE ROLLING JUST ABOVE US REMARKED THE BOY WHO WAS ALMOST AS UNEASY AS CAP'N BILL
BUT AS THEY PASSED THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THEY HEARD A LOW MOAN AND STOPPED TO LISTEN
SO HE SUMMONED UP HIS BEST COURAGE OPENED THE DOOR STEPPED QUICKLY INSIDE--AND CLOSED THE DOOR AFTER HIM
I WONDER WHY FOLKS GET CROSS WHEN IT RAINS
BUT TROT DID NOT THINK IT SAFE TO UNBIND HIM JUST THEN
OUR FRIENDS THE FROGS HAVE AGREED TO HELP US THROUGH THE FOG BANK
I'M SURE THE UMBRELLA COULD CARRY TWENTY PEOPLE IF THEY COULD BE FASTENED TO THE HANDLE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
AS TROT LOOKED AT HIM SHE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT HE HAD ONE FOOT OUT OF BED AND THAT TO HIS BIG TOE WAS TIED A CORD THAT LED OUT OF THE BEDCHAMBER INTO A SMALL DRESSING ROOM BEYOND
THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU BEFORE THEY CAST THEIR FINAL VOTE THAT THEY MAY EXAMINE YOU CAREFULLY AND DISCOVER IF YOU ARE WORTHY TO BECOME INHABITANTS OF THE PINK COUNTRY THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE BUT TROT IS SWEETER THAN THE TWO DECLARED THE PARROT IN A LOUD VOICE
VERY WELL INDIGO
WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE MONSTERS PAPA ASKED THE FOURTH PRINCESS
THEY ALL WATCHED HIM WITH INTEREST UNTIL HE HAD DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE PALACE WHEN THE KING TURNED TO HIS MEN AND SAID
THEN SHE STEPPED UPON IT AND BEGAN WALKING FORWARD
I KNEW I'D GET AN AWFUL SCOLDING TOO FOR RUNNING AWAY AND TAKING THE FAMILY LUCK WITH ME SO I THOUGHT THAT AS LONG AS I WAS IN FOR IT I'D BETTER SEE A GOOD DEAL OF THE COUNTRY WHILE I HAD THE CHANCE
HOW WICKED CRIED INDIGO
BECAUSE HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF
TIGGLE HIDING IN THE CELLAR OF A DESERTED HOUSE IN A BACK STREET AT LAST HEARD THESE CRIES AND JOYFULLY CAME FORTH TO CONFRONT THE MESSENGER
HERE THE CLOUDS WERE NOT BLACK NOR HEAVY BUT THEY ASSUMED QUEER SHAPES
BUT IT WILL TAKE HIM TIME TO DO THAT AND TIME IS ALL I WANT ANSWERED THE CHILD
BUT AS LONG AS WE STAY HERE IT SEEMS A PRETTY GOOD THING TO BE QUEEN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ROARED AS HE SAW BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEY'RE UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTERS
NEVER MIND CAP'N BILL VENTURED TO SAY IT WON'T WORRY HIM SO MUCH TO HOLD THE UMBRELLA MUM AS TO LET IT GO
HERE'S A LOVELY HOW-D'Y'-DO WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE BOO-LOO-ROO
THE LAST SCENE ENDED WITH THE TRIP THROUGH THE FOG BANK AND THE ASSISTANCE RENDERED THEM BY THE FRIENDLY FROG
I WANT TO SEE IF THE NEW SEAT FITS ME AN MAKE CERTAIN THE UMBREL WILL CARRY ALL THREE OF US VERY WELL SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
AT LAST SHE FOUND A WINDOW AND MANAGED TO OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND LET THE MOONLIGHT IN
THE MAGIC UMBRELLA FELL TO THE GROUND AND BUTTON-BRIGHT PROMPTLY SEIZED IT
DID YOU EVER TASTE A PARSNIP WE'RE IN A HURRY IF IT'S THE SAME TO YOU SIR SAID CAP'N BILL POLITELY
THERE WAS A ROW OF THICK BUSHES WHICH CONCEALED THE GULF BELOW AND AS THEY APPROACHED THESE BUSHES THE RAIN ABRUPTLY CEASED AND THE CLOUDS BEGAN TO BREAK AND DRIFT AWAY IN THE SKY
I'D GET ALONG WITHOUT THE SUNSET IF ONLY WE COULD GO HOME THEY WENT IN TO DINNER AFTER THIS AND SAT AT CORALIE'S OWN TABLE WITH HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN AND FOUND THE MEAL VERY GOOD
THESE WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO TRIBES WHICH WERE CALLED THE SUNRISE TRIBE AND THE SUNSET TRIBE
THE PARROT WAS THERE TOO AS THE BIRD REFUSED TO BE LEFT BEHIND
IT'S A TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT AND IN A COUNTRY WHERE ONE CAN'T DIE OR BE KILLED UNTIL HE HAS LIVED HIS SIX HUNDRED YEARS TO BE PATCHED IS A GREAT MISFORTUNE I'M SURE IT IS SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT EARNESTLY
IT WAS AWKWARDLY SCRAWLED FOR THE BOY WAS NOT MUCH OF A WRITER BUT TROT MANAGED TO MAKE OUT THE WORDS
BUT A HUNGRY CHILD CAN'T WAIT A WHOLE HOUR I'M SURE
IF YOU WILL LOOK CLOSELY YOU WILL SEE THAT OUR SKINS ARE WHITE THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN WHAT SHE SAYS REMARKED ONE OF THE MEN THOUGHTFULLY
DIDN'T BUTTON-BRIGHT COME SAFE ALL THE WAY FROM PHILYDELFY I THINK I'D LIKE TO GO TO SKY ISLAND SAID THE BOY
TROT PATTED HIS HEAD GENTLY AND THIS SURPRISED THE DOG WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CUFFS AND KICKS
IT DON'T COME DUE TILL AFTER YOU'RE DEAD AN THEN YOU CAN'T GET MUCH FUN OUT O IT I DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE THE QUEEN ANSWERED TOURMALINE SIMPLY
SAID THE BIRD
THE IMMENSE BLADE WAS SO HEAVY THAT IT TOOK THE STRENGTH OF SEVEN BLUESKINS TO RAISE IT
HOW VULGAR CRIED TURQUOISE
IN RAPID SUCCESSION THE SCENES SHIFTED AND DISCLOSED THE TRIAL FLIGHTS WITH TROT AND CAP'N BILL AS PASSENGERS THEN THE TRIP TO SKY ISLAND AND THE MEETING WITH THE BOOLOOROO
THEY CAN'T HELP BEING GIRLS OF COURSE
THE GARDEN WAS JUST BELOW
ILLUSTRATION THE JOURNEY HOME
BUT WHY WASN'T IT MADE FOR HUMANS TOO IF THEY CAN MANAGE TO FLY IN IT
END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF SKY ISLAND BY L
HE FORGOT THAT HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE UMBRELLA COULD FLY AND AFTER BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT HAD BOTH GONE TO BED THE OLD SAILOR WENT OUT INTO THE SHED AND WORKED AWHILE BEFORE HE TOO TURNED INTO HIS BUNK THE SANDMAN WASN'T AROUND AND CAP'N BILL LAY AWAKE FOR HOURS THINKING OF THE STRANGE TALE OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA BEFORE HE FINALLY SANK INTO SLUMBER
OH HO
THEY HAD WALKED TO THE HIGH BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE SEA WHERE A GIGANTIC ACACIA TREE STOOD ON THE VERY EDGE
I'LL HAVE SIZZLE MAKE A FINE YARD FOR THE GOAT WHERE HE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF BLUE GRASS TO EAT
YES
YES
YES
YES
BUT I AM ALLOWED TO WORK ONLY ONE MAGIC CHARM EVERY THREE DAYS--NOT OFTENER--AND PERHAPS I'LL NEED THE MAGIC FOR OTHER THINGS STRIKES ME MA'AM RETURNED THE SAILOR THAT WHAT WE NEED MOST ON THIS EXPEDITION IS TO CAPTURE THE BLUESKINS
TOURMALINE HASTENED AWAY TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE TO PUT ON A BEAUTIFUL GOWN ALL COVERED WITH FLOUNCES AND RIBBONS FOR SHE WAS GLAD TO BE RELIEVED OF THE DUTIES OF QUEEN AND WAS EAGER TO BE GAILY DRESSED AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE AGAIN
SHE MADE A SIGNAL TO THE PINKIE BAND WHICH STRUCK UP A FINE PINK MARCH AND THEN THE ARMY STEPPED OUT WITH THE LEFT FOOT FIRST AND AWAY WENT THE CONQUERORS DOWN THE STREETS OF THE BLUE CITY OUT OF THE BLUE-BARRED GATEWAY AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY TOWARD THE FOG BANK
THEY'RE CURIOSITIES YOU SEE AND MAY SERVE TO AMUSE US
THE OTHER SIDE'S THE ONLY SAFE SIDE FOR US WE DON'T KNOW THAT SIR SAID THE BOY
I DON'T LIKE BOYS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO GIRLS
DON'T DESPAIR WHATEVER HAPPENS FOR BEHIND THE CLOUDS IS ALWAYS THE RAINBOW THANK YOU POLLY HE ANSWERED AND TROT ALSO THANKED THE LOVELY POLYCHROME--AND SO DID CAP'N BILL
I DIDN'T CARE HOW IT LOOKED
I'VE HEARN TELL O THEM SKY KEERIDGES
WE'VE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE PATCHED YOU KNOW WHAT IS BEING PATCHED ASKED THE BOY
GOODNESS ME
INDIGO SCREAMING WITH FRIGHT SPRANG TO HER FEET AGAIN BUT THE RABBIT RAN BETWEEN HER LEGS AND TRIPPED HER UP ALL THE TIME ROARING LOUDLY LIKE A LION AND THE DOG CROWED TRIUMPHANTLY AS A ROOSTER CROWS WHILE THE CAT WARBLED NOISILY AND THE LAMB CHATTERED AND THE PARROT BARKED AND THE PEACOCK SCREECHED
THE WIZARD OF OZ THE LAND OF OZ OZMA OF OZ DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD IN OZ THE ROAD TO OZ THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ THE PATCHWORK GIRL OF OZ TIK-TOK OF OZ THE SCARECROW OF OZ RINKITINK IN OZ THE LOST PRINCESS OF OZ THE TIN WOODMAN OF OZ THE MAGIC OF OZ GLINDA OF OZ CHICAGO THE REILLY LEE CO
HE'S THE WORST I EV-ER KNEW THE PARROT REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN
BUT UMBRELLAS ARE GOOD FOR OTHER THINGS SIDES RAIN FRAID OF GETT'N SUN-STRUCK ASKED TROT
THAT NIGHT NONE OF THEM SLEPT MUCH FOR THEY ALL LAY AWAKE WONDERING HOW THEY COULD EVER RETURN TO THE EARTH AND TO THEIR HOMES
CAP'N BILL WAS MUCH INTERESTED
THE QUEEN SEEMS LIKE A NICE GIRL AND I DON'T THINK SHE'LL HURT US WHATEVER HAPPENS THEY WALKED FREELY ALONG THE CIRCULAR STREET SEEING SUCH SIGHTS AS THE PINK CITY AFFORDED AND THEN RETURNED TO CORALIE'S HOUSE FOR BREAKFAST
IT DOESN'T PULL HARD AT ALL
THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER WHAT PAYS YOU THEN FOR ALL YOUR BOTHER ASKED TROT
NOW YOU BLUE CAP'N WHO ARE YOU AND YOUR SOLDIERS GOING TO OBEY--ME OR THE SNUBNOSED ONES YOU DECLARED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS POSITIVELY FOR HE HATED THE PRINCESSES AS DID ALL THE BLUESKINS
IT'S A PRETTY OLD-LOOKIN BUMBERSHOOT THEY WERE ALL SEATED IN THE VINE-SHADED PORCH OF THE COTTAGE--ALL BUT MRS GRIFFITH WHO HAD GONE INTO THE KITCHEN TO LOOK AFTER THE SUPPER--AND TROT WAS ON ONE SIDE OF THE BOY HOLDING THE PLATE FOR HIM WHILE CAP'N BILL SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE
YOU'RE SURE TO LIKE IT I GUESS I'M TOO HEAVY HE SAID
THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
WELL SAID HE LET'S GO HOME
HOW DARE YOU I SAY
CREID THE SAILOR IN A VOICE=>CRIED THE SAILOR IN A VOICE WHICH HAD BEN ENCHANTED BY ROSALIE=>WHICH HAD BEEN ENCHANTED BY ROSALIE WENT THE CONQUERERS DOWN THE STREETS =>WENT THE CONQUERORS DOWN THE STREETS SPOKEMAN IN REPLYING TO QUEEN TROT'S SPEECH.=>SPOKESMAN IN REPLYING TO QUEEN TROT'S SPEECH
KI-YI
UNCLE BOB SAID OUR FAM'LY ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IT BROUGHT EM GOOD LUCK TO OWN THIS UMBRELLA
WHO KNOWS SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
SOME OF THE BLUESKINS HAD BY NOW OPENED A GATE AND OUT RUSHED A CROWD TO CAPTURE THE FUGITIVE
IT DOES SAID THE MAN GLANCING AT THE SKY
WE'VE GOT AN EXTRA ROOM WITH A NICE BED IN IT AND WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU STAY--JUST AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO--WOULDN'T WE CAP'N BILL RIGHT YOU ARE MATE REPLIED THE OLD MAN NODDING HIS BALD HEAD
THE PARROT WAS GETTING ITS FEATHERS SADLY DRAGGLED IN THE RAIN AND THE POOR BIRD SOON PRESENTED A WET AND WOEBEGONE APPEARANCE
THEN ITS SPEED GRADUALLY SLACKENED
SALADIN PARACELSUS DE LAMBERTINE EVAGNE VON SMITH GUESS I'LL CALL YOU BUTTON-BRIGHT SAID TROT SIGHING
THE WOODEN LEG STUCK OUT INTO THE ROOM AT AN ANGLE AND THE SHOE ON HIS ONE FOOT HAD BEEN REMOVED SO THAT THE END OF THE CORD COULD BE FASTENED TO THE SAILOR'S BIG TOE
THE DAUGHTERS OF THE RAINBOW WHISPERED TOURMALINE IN AN AWED VOICE AND THE WITCH BESIDE HER NODDED AND SAID
I'LL MAKE THE LAWS MYSELF FROM NOW ON AND I'LL UNMAKE EVERY LAW YOU EVER HAD BEFORE I CONQUERED YOU OH
BUTTON-BRIGHT STOOD ON THE BENCH AND HELD UP THE MAGIC UMBRELLA SO HE COULD OPEN IT AND THE SAILOR HAD JUST ATTACHED THE ROPES WHEN A THIN BLUE LINE SHOT OUT FROM BEHIND THEM AND IN A TWINKLING WOUND ITSELF AROUND THE UMBRELLA
SOON THEY HAD LEFT THE CREATURE FAR BEHIND
SO TROT TIED A SMALL SOFA CUSHION AROUND THE END OF HIS WOODEN LEG SO IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY NOISE POUNDING UPON THE FLOOR AND THEN SHE QUIETLY LED THE SAILOR THROUGH THE ROOM OF THE SLEEPING BOOLOOROO AND THROUGH SEVERAL OTHER ROOMS UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE PASSAGE
YOU MUST FIRST TAKE THAT INSULTING UMBRELLA OUT OF MY DOMINIONS WHY WHAT IS THERE ABOUT MY UMBRELLA THAT SEEMS INSULTING ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT IN SURPRISE
I'VE KEP SECRETS--ONCE IN A WHILE ASSERTED CAP'N BILL
MRS GRIFFITH BUSY WITH HER WORK KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN REGARD TO THE FLIGHT OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
HE WAS QUITE THE BEST LOOKING PERSON THE BOY HAD SEEN IN SKY ISLAND AND HE SPOKE IN A PLEASANT WAY AND SEEMED QUITE FRIENDLY
NOT YET SHE REPLIED
AND THEN HE SAID APPEALINGLY
IT--IT BELONGS IN OUR FAMILY SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT BEGINNING TO EAT AND SPEAKING BETWEEN BITES
SINCE LAST THURSDAY I GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BOOLOOROO AT ALL HOORAY CRIED THE PARROT
HE PUT THE KEY IN HIS OWN POCKET SO I DON'T KNOW AS I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
BUT SEEIN AS YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS WE'D BETTER HAVE IT OUT WITH YOUR QUEEN FIRST AS LAST THEIR CLOTHING WAS QUITE DRY BY THIS TIME ALTHOUGH MUCH WRINKLED AND DISCOLORED BY THE PENETRATING FOG SO AT ONCE THEY PREPARED TO FOLLOW THE PINKIES
CAP'N BILL WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO FOR I'VE ORDERED TIGGLE TO MIX THE NECTAR THANK E FRIEND SIZZLE SAID CAP'N BILL
WE'VE HAD A GOOD TIME
IT IS YOUR DUTY I KNOW ANSWERED TOURMALINE
GRADUALLY A PINK MIST FORMED IN THE AIR ABOUT THE WITCH AND IN THIS MIST THE VISION BEGAN TO APPEAR
A BLUE GLOOM HUNG OVER THE CITY WHICH WAS SCARCELY RELIEVED BY A FEW BLUISH WAVERING LIGHTS HERE AND THERE BUT TROT KNEW THE GENERAL DIRECTION IN WHICH THE PALACE LAY AND SHE DECIDED TO GO THERE FIRST
THE SAILORMAN DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN ANY OF THE ROOMS SHE ENTERED SO SHE DECIDED TO VISIT THE BOOLOOROO'S OWN APARTMENTS
BUT A LEAGUE ISN'T A MILE YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK CAP'N BILL
AS HE CAME PEGGING ALONG THE PATH AS HE HIMSELF DESCRIBED HIS HOBBLING WALK HIS HANDS WERE PUSHED INTO HIS COAT POCKETS A PIPE WAS IN HIS MOUTH AND HIS BLACK NECKSCARF WAS FLUTTERING BEHIND HIM IN THE BREEZE LIKE A SABLE BANNER
WE DO NOT THINK IT MATTERS WHAT YOU WERE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY FOR HAVING LEFT THERE YOU HAVE FORFEITED YOUR RANK
SOMETHIN'S BOUND TO HAPPEN PRETTY SOON YOU KNOW I THINK SO MYSELF ANSWERED THE BOY
FOR BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD ESCAPED INTO THE FOG BANK AND GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS AFRAID THE BOY WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE SEEN IN THE BLUE COUNTRY
THE TRUNK SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND THE ENTIRE HEAD BEGAN TO SWELL AND GROW LARGER
NOW INDEED THE BOOLOOROO WAS AS ANGRY AS HE WAS AMAZED
BUT I'LL PUNISH YOU
IF HE HAS ALREADY REIGNED THREE HUNDRED YEARS AS I SUSPECT THEN HE IS NOW FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
THE PINKIES WOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE THEIR NEW FRIENDS THE EARTH PEOPLE LEAVE THEM BUT ASKED THE QUEEN OF SKY ISLAND TO CARRY WITH HER THE ROYAL BAND OF PINK GOLD WHICH SHE NOW WORE UPON HER BROW TOGETHER WITH THE GLISTENING PINK JEWEL SET IN ITS CENTER
NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT JUST BREAD-AN'-BUTTER'S GOOD ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY AND IT TAKES TIME TO SPREAD SUGAR ON WE'LL HAVE SUPPER IN AN HOUR OBSERVED TROT'S MOTHER BRISKLY
THERE'S =CAP'N BILL=
BUT ALL OF THEM WERE WONDERFULLY RELIEVED TO REACH THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY IN SAFETY FOR ASIDE FROM THE DANGER THAT THREATENED THEM IN THE BLUE COUNTRY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND WAS VERY DEPRESSING
ANYTHING ELSE ASKED TROT DRAWING A LONG BREATH
HE COULD FOLLOW ITS COURSE UNTIL IT DESCENDED IN THE VILLAGE AND HE WAS SO AMAZED AND ABSORBED THAT HIS PIPE WENT OUT
SAID INDIGO
OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE THE DECIDING VOTE THEN YOU BEING THE RULER OH NO REPLIED TOURMALINE
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET I CAN TRY SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
I'M NO SLAVE AND SHE CUDDLED DOWN CLOSER IN THE CHAIR
THAT WAS THIS MORNING THIS MORNIN EXCLAIMED CAP'N BILL
IT SEEMS YOU MUST MIX THE ROYAL NECTAR CAP'N BILL
WOULDN'T THEY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WOULD MATE
TROT LAUGHED AND PATTED THE BIRD'S HEAD IN RETURN FOR THE COMPLIMENT
IT IS FURTHERMORE SAID THAT THOSE WHO ENTER THE FOG BANK FORFEIT THE SIX HUNDRED YEARS ALLOWED THEM TO LIVE AND ARE LIABLE TO DIE AT ANY TIME
COME IN PLEASE SAID TOURMALINE OPENING THE DOOR FOR THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED SHE PLACED A PINKWOOD BENCH FOR THEM TO SIT UPON AND WENT BACK TO HER THRONE WHICH WAS A COMMON ROCKING-CHAIR
THEY ASKED QUESTIONS TOO WANTING TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF AN AEROPLANE THIS WAS AND WHERE HIS POWER WAS STORED AND LOTS OF OTHER THINGS
I GUESS I AM
LOOKING FAR OUT OVER THE PACIFIC THE GIRL'S EYES FELL UPON A DIM ISLAND LYING ON THE HORIZON LINE--JUST WHERE THE SKY AND WATER SEEMED TO MEET--AND THE SIGHT GAVE HER AN IDEA
THAT'S A LONG TIME TO REMEMBER AND WE BLUESKINS TRY TO FORGET ALL WE CAN--ESPECIALLY WHATEVER IS UNPLEASANT
BUT AS THEY'RE ONLY HALF CIVILIZED I SHALL MAKE THEM MY SLAVES WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR
HE WAS SHIPWRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND ONCE AND ANOTHER TIME A CANNIBAL KING TRIED TO BOIL HIM FOR DINNER AN ONE DAY A SHARK CHASED HIM SEVEN LEAGUES THROUGH THE WATER AN WHAT'S A LEAGUE ASKED THE BOY
ME-OW ALTOGETHER INDIGO WAS AS TROT SAID SCARED STIFF AND SHE HOWLED FOR HELP UNTIL HER SISTERS RAN IN AND RESCUED HER PULLING HER THROUGH THE BEDCHAMBER INTO THE RECEPTION ROOM
BUT NO ONE CAN LAY HANDS ON IT BECAUSE THE BOOLOOROO KEEPS IT SAFELY LOCKED UP IN HIS TREASURE CHAMBER WHERE'S THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
BEFORE THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WENT TO THE ROYAL BANQUET HALL COBALT STUCK HER HEAD THROUGH A CRACK OF THE DOOR AND SAID TO TROT
JUMP SORT O EASY PLEASE BEGGED CAP'N BILL
WHEN CAP'N BILL CAME UP PANTING AND ALL OUT OF BREATH THE BLUESKINS SEIZED HIM AND HELD HIM FAST
SO NOW HE HELD IT CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HE WAS READY TO FLY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
KNOW ANYONE AROUND HERE HE ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
DID YOU DROP DOWN IN THAT WAY MY LAD HE ASKED THE BOY
BUT I DON'T KNOW AS I'D BELIEVE IT MYSELF IF IT HADN'T BEEN ME THAT IT HAPPENED TO I BELIEVE EV'RY WORD OF IT DECLARED TROT EARNESTLY
IT WAS A LITTLE VERSE CAP'N BILL HAD TAUGHT THE BIRD THAT VERY MORNING WHILE TROT WAS SEEING THE SUN RISE
IT SOUNDS BIGGER NER YOU ARE AN I DON'T LIKE THE WORD ANYHOW
A PINK CAN THINK AS QUICK'S A WINK THE PARROT DECLARED
BUT NONE OF THESE FANCIFUL VAPORY CREATURES SEEMED INCLINED TO MOLEST THEM OR TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR FLIGHT AND AFTER A WHILE THE UMBRELLA DIPPED BELOW THIS QUEER CLOUDLAND AND ENTERED A CLEAR SPACE WHERE THE SKY WAS OF AN EXQUISITE BLUE COLOR
HE HAD FINISHED HIS DINNER WHERE HIS SIX DAUGHTERS HAD BITTERLY DENOUNCED TROT ALL THROUGH THE MEAL AND IMPLORED THEIR FATHER TO INVENT SOME NEW AND TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT FOR HER
THIS STORY OF SKY ISLAND HAS ASTONISHED ME CONSIDERABLY AND I THINK IT WILL ALSO ASTONISH YOU
HOORAY
THE QUEER SHAPES OF THE CLOUDS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME AND ONCE OR TWICE TROT WAS A LITTLE FRIGHTENED WHEN A MONSTROUS AIRY DRAGON PASSED BESIDE THEM OR A HUGE GIANT STOOD UPON A PEAK OF CLOUD AND STARED SAVAGELY AT THE INTRUDERS INTO HIS DOMAIN
WE'RE NOT GOIN TO SAID TROT
NO SAID THE GIRL
THEIR BLUE HAIR WAS ELABORATELY DRESSED AND CAME TO A POINT AT THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
THE ROYAL BOOTBLUE IS CONSIDERED A HIGH OFFICIAL IN SKY ISLAND
BUT O COURSE WE CAN'T STIR A STEP WITHOUT THE MAGIC UMBREL NO
HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE HANDLE AND SAW THAT THE RED EYES OF THE CARVED ELEPHANT'S HEAD WERE ROLLING FIERCELY AND SENDING OUT RED SPARKS OF ANGER IN ALL DIRECTIONS
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME FLY WITH YOU--WAY TO TOWN AND BACK--TO-MORROW
AS FER ME SAID CAP'N BILL SLOWLY I'M GOIN TO BELIEVE IT TOO BY'M'BY WHEN I'VE SEEN THE UMBREL FLY ONCE YOU'LL SEE ME FLY AWAY WITH IT ASSERTED THE BOY
HOLD TIGHT BUTT'N-BRIGHT
NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE PROPERLY FED OUR PETS REPLIED AZURE WITH A SCOWL
OUR FRIENDS LEARNED CONSIDERABLE ABOUT THE PINKIES DURING THAT AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR THEIR HOSTESS PROVED KIND AND AGREEABLE AND FRANKLY ANSWERED ALL THEIR QUESTIONS
WON'T IT BE FINE CAP'N BILL DUNNO TROT SAID HE
WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS THE KING PULLED THE CORD A SECOND TIME AND TROT AT THE SAME INSTANT PULLED UPON HER ROPE
CAP'N BILL ROLLED OVER AND BLINKED HARDLY REMEMBERING WHERE HE WAS
I THINK I'D RATHER TAKE A CHANCE ON THE FOG BANK SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
I SHALL MARCH THESE THREE STRANGERS THROUGH THE ARCH AND IF BY ANY CHANCE THEY COME OUT ALIVE I'LL DO A NEW SORT OF PATCHING--I'LL CHOP OFF THEIR HEADS AND MIX EM UP PUTTING THE WRONG HEAD ON EACH OF EM
ARE ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE OLD BOOLOOROO HERE INQUIRED CAP'N BILL WHO WAS SORRY TO SEE TROT LOOKING SO SAD AND DOWNCAST
ILLUSTRATION TELL FATHER TO CALL FOR ME IN AN HOUR OR TWO SAID SHE
TROT WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE ESCAPE OF GHIP-GHISIZZLE BUT DID NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHO IT WAS
AS THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO THIS COMMAND THE PRINCESS SEIZED A BASIN OF WATER AND DASHED THE FLUID OVER THE BEASTS AND BIRDS AFTER WHICH SHE RENEWED HER ATTEMPT TO PUSH TROT FROM THE ROOM
TROT KISSED ROSALIE AND CORALIE AND TOURMALINE GOOD-BYE AND SAID TO THEM
WHY THERE'S A BOAT CAST LOOSE AN IT'S GOIN TO SMASH ON THE ROCKS
YOU WILL ALLOW HIM TO PASS INTO HIS MAJESTY'S CHAMBER TO GET THE ROYAL SHOES AND TO RETURN THEM WHEN THEY ARE BLUED ALL RIGHT ANSWERED THE GUARD
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BOTH TROT AND CAP'N BILL NOW LOOKED AT THE BOY IN ASTONISHMENT
THEN OFF IT WENT AGAIN ITS TREMENDOUS LEAP CARRYING IT FAR INTO THE FOG
MY FATHER ONCE SAID I WAS BRIGHT AS A BUTTON AN IT MADE EVER'BODY LAUGH
INDIGO WANTED TO HAVE TROT PATCHED AND CERULIA WANTED HER BEATEN WITH KNOTTED CORDS AND COBALT WANTED HER LOCKED UP IN A DARK ROOM AND SAPPHIRE WANTED HER FED ON SAND AND TURQUOISE WANTED HER BOUND TO A WINDMILL AND SO BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS DESIRES THEY QUARRELLED AND ARGUED UNTIL DINNER TIME ARRIVED
TROT WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE WITCH'S SUGGESTION FOR SHE BELIEVED IN FAIRIES AND TRUSTED THEM
IF THAT ISN'T A FAIRY STORY I NEVER HEARD ONE IT IS A FAIRY STORY AGREED BUTTON-BRIGHT
BUT WE'RE OBLIGED TO LIVE ALL OF THE SIX HUNDRED YEARS WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT
FOR GOODNESS SAKE KEEP QUIET SAID TROT
YOU MUS BE A STRANGER IN THESE PARTS LITTLE BOY NOT TO KNOW BOUT CAP'N GRIFFITH SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE INTENTLY
BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE POSITIVELY REFUSED
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE JUS THE SAME AND THEN SHE EXPLAINED ABOUT THE MAGIC RING ROSALIE HAD LENT HER WHICH RENDERED HER INVISIBLE WHILE SHE WORE IT--UNLESS SHE TOUCHED SOME LIVING CREATURE
AFTER THEY HAD EATEN ALL THEY COULD AND THE SERVANTS HAD BEEN SENT AWAY TROT RELATED HER ADVENTURES TELLING HOW WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE BILLYGOAT SHE HAD TURNED THE TABLES ON THE WICKED BOOLOOROO
I ADVISE YOU TO EAT FOR AFTER OUR DINNER WE WILL DECIDE UPON A FITTING PUNISHMENT FOR YOU AND THEN I'M SURE YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH APPETITE THANK YOU REPLIED THE GIRL
YOU SEE HE IS TRYING TO STEAL ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS OF RULE SO AS TO REMAIN A TYRANT ALL HIS LIFE HE DON'T SEEM AS OLD AS THAT OBSERVED CAP'N BILL THOUGHTFULLY
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO CRY OVER SPILT MILK I DON'T MIND
FINDING THEMSELVES SO SUDDENLY DISARMED THE AMAZED BLUESKINS TURNED ABOUT AND RAN AGAIN WHILE CAP'N BILL GREATLY EXCITED BY HIS VICTORY SHOUTED TO HIS FOLLOWERS TO PURSUE THE ENEMY AND HOBBLED AFTER THEM AS FAST AS HE COULD MAKE HIS WOODEN LEG GO SWINGING HIS SHARP STICK AS HE ADVANCED
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE THE UMBRELLA WITH US TO THE PINK COUNTRY
THE HOUSES AND TREES ON THE COAST COULD BE SEEN AND PRESENTLY--ALMOST BEFORE THEY REALIZED IT--THEY WERE SET DOWN GENTLY UPON THE HIGH BLUFF NEAR THE GIANT ACACIA
HO HO
THAT'S THE END OF THOSE SHORT-NECKED YELLOWSKINS SAID ONE SHAKING HIS HEAD
AT ONCE HE DECIDED THIS MUST BE THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE HE SEARCHED IN EVERY OTHER POCKET--WITHOUT FINDING ANOTHER KEY
THEY'RE RHEUMATIC IT'S SO MOIST HERE THEY CLIMBED OVER SOME OF THE HUGE LEGS AND WALKED AROUND OTHERS
FRANK BAUM LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CATALOG CARD NO
NOW THEN TAKE HER AWAY BUT TROT WAS OBSTINATE AND WOULDN'T BUDGE A STEP
AND A SLAVE MUST OBEY WHY ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME OF COURSE I REMEMBER BUTTON-BRIGHT REPLIED THE MAIDEN IN A SWEET TINKLING VOICE
NO ONE HERE LIKES US AND IN A FEW DAYS THEY MAY MAKE AN END OF US OH BUTTON-BRIGHT
BY THIS TIME THE PINKIES HAD ADVANCED HALFWAY TO THE WALLS OF THE CITY SO THE FIRST THING THE BOOLOOROO DID WAS TO ORDER ALL THE GATES CLOSED AND LOCKED AND THEN HE PLACED A LINE OF SOLDIERS ON THE WALL TO PREVENT ANY OF THE PINKIES FROM CLIMBING OVER
THE SNUBNOSES HATE ME WORSE THAN THE PEOPLE DO I CAN'T IMAGINE A BOOTBLUE BECOMING A ROYAL FAVORITE GRUMBLED BUTTON-BRIGHT
LET US TAKE THE LITTLE GIRL TO BE OUR MAID--TO WAIT UPON US AND AMUSE US WHEN WE'RE DULL
IN THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER TROT'S CONQUEST OF THE BLUES THE LITTLE GIRL CONCEIVED ANOTHER IDEA
BUT OF COURSE THIS END OF THE ISLAND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT HOW CAME YOU IN THE BLUE COUNTRY FROM WHENCE YOU SAY YOU ESCAPED ASKED THE MAN
GHIP-GHISIZZLE TOOK THE BOOK EAGERLY AND AT ONCE BEGAN TURNING OVER ITS LEAVES
IF HE HAD RECEIVED THEM AS FRIENDS INSTEAD OF MAKING THEM SLAVES THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE ESCAPED TO THE PINKIES AND BROUGHT AN ARMY INTO THE BLUE COUNTRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE REVENGED
IT'S ONLY ABOUT SIX JUMPS HE TURNED AROUND MADE A MIGHTY LEAP AND DISAPPEARED IN THE GRAY MIST
CORALIE TOOK THEM TO HER OWN HOME WHERE SHE LIVED IN GREAT LUXURY BEING ONE OF THE PROMINENT WOMEN OF THE PINKIES
AND NOW REMARKED GHIP-GHISIZZLE SINCE YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR NEW DUTIES PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME AND SEE THE BLUE CITY AND THE GLORIOUS BLUE COUNTRY OF SKY ISLAND WE WOULD THAT CRIED CAP'N BILL PROMPTLY
FLY HIGH!--MIND YOUR EYE
SURELY THIS IS MAGIC DECLARED ONE OF THE MEN
THERE ISN'T ANY WATER AROUND IT IS THERE NO BUT THERE IS SKY ALL AROUND IT ANSWERED CORALIE
ISN'T IT PRETTY IT'S PRETTY SMALL SEEMS TO ME ANSWERED THE BOY
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND SO TAKE ME HOME AGAIN BUT THE UMBRELLA WOULDN'T
HE IS NOW FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND HAS YET ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS TO LIVE
OUR FRIENDS OBEYED AND LEAVING THE ROOM THEY ENTERED THE COURTYARD AND EXAMINED THE ROWS OF PINK MARBLE STATUES FOR NEARLY AN HOUR BEFORE THEY WERE SUMMONED TO RETURN TO THE LITTLE ROOM IN TOURMALINE'S PALACE
TAKE US TO TROT'S HOUSE ON THE EARTH THE UMBRELLA OBEYED AT ONCE MOUNTING INTO THE AIR
WE'VE GOT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THINGS IN SKY ISLAND FIRST OF ALL
THE LITTLE GIRL COULD HAVE CRIED WITH VEXATION AND I THINK SHE DID WEEP A FEW TEARS BEFORE SHE RECOVERED HER COURAGE
YOUR COLOR IS MOST PECULIAR BUT THERE ISN'T A SHADE OF BLUE ABOUT ANY OF YOU EXCEPT THE DEEP BLUE COLOR OF THE CLOTHES THE OLD APE THAT CHOKED ME WEARS
AND YOUR PRESENCE HERE IS STILL MORE STRANGE AND ASTONISHING
QUICK CRIED THE BOY
A SERVANT CAME TO THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE CONVERSING TO STATE THAT THE SUN WAS ABOUT TO SET AND AT ONCE CORALIE AROSE AND TOOK THE STRANGERS TO AN UPPER BALCONY WHERE ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HAD ASSEMBLED
THE SOLDIER GAVE A YELL THAT AROUSED A SCORE OF HIS COMRADES AND BROUGHT THEM TUMBLING INTO THE STREET
LET ER GO
BUT THE UMBRELLA HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THE CABINET
BUT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT THE FEROCIOUS BLUE WOLF WAS GUARDING THE INTERIOR OF THE CHAMBER SO HE SEARCHED IN SOME OF THE ROOMS UNTIL HE FOUND A SOFA-PILLOW WHICH HE PUT UNDER HIS ARM AND THEN RETURNED TO THE CORRIDOR
YOU APES
FOR AMERIKY WASN'T DISKIVERED IN THEM DAYS THERE SAID TROT TRIUMPHANTLY DIDN'T I TELL YOU BUTTON-BRIGHT THAT CAP'N BILL KNOWS EVER'THING HE KNOWS A LOT I EXPECT SOBERLY ANSWERED THE BOY FINISHING THE LAST SLICE OF BREAD-AND-BUTTER AND THEN LOOKING AT THE EMPTY PLATE WITH A SIGH
THEN A PANIC FELL UPON THE PINKIES AT THE LOSS OF THEIR LEADER AND TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT CALLED OUT IN VAIN FOR THEM TO RESCUE CAP'N BILL
BIND IT UP SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS COBALT UNFASTEN MY SHOES
IF I ONCE TELL IT TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE THE UMBRELLA WILL GO THERE AND NOWHERE ELSE
HE REALIZED THAT WHEN THE GREAT KNIFE HAD SLICED THE PRISONERS IN TWO AND THEIR HALVES WERE PATCHED TOGETHER THEY WOULD PRESENT A RIDICULOUS SIGHT AND ALL THE BLUESKINS WOULD LAUGH AT THEM AND AVOID THEM
HOORAY YELLED THE PARROT WELCOME TO OUR HAPPY HOME FROM WHICH NO LONGER WILL WE ROAM AND THEN HE FLAPPED HIS WINGS AND BARKED LIKE A DOG WITH PURE DELIGHT AND ADDED AS FAST AS HIS BIRD'S TONGUE COULD SPEAK
IT HAD ROPES AND TWO WOODEN SEATS AND A WICKER BASKET ALL ATTACHED TO THE HANDLE
WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
I DON'T JUS KNOW HOW I'M GOIN TO RULE THIS COUNTRY YET BUT I'LL THINK IT OVER AN LET YOU KNOW THEN SHE WENT INTO THE PALACE HUT WITH CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH AND THE PEOPLE WENT AWAY TO ENJOY THEMSELVES AND TALK OVER THE SURPRISING EVENTS OF THE DAY
EACH ONE BORE A LONG POINTED STICK AS THE MAIN WEAPON AND HAD TWO SHORT POINTED STICKS STUCK IN HIS BELT
HE PASSED THE GUARD OF THE ROYAL TREASURY AND FREDJIM NODDED GOOD-NATUREDLY TO THE BOY
THE GIRLS APPROACHED IN A LINE ALONG THE GARDEN PATH ALL WALKING WITH MINCING STEPS AND HOLDING THEIR CHINS HIGH
SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE AT THAT REMEMBERING SHE WORE THE RING OF ROSALIE THE WITCH WHICH RENDERED HER INVISIBLE
YOU WILL NOTICE MY COMPLEXION IS OF A LIGHTER PINK THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER OF MY PEOPLE YES REMARKED POLYCHROME LOOKING AT HER CRITICALLY WHEN YOU WERE MADE QUEEN WITHOUT DOUBT YOU HAD THE LIGHTEST COLORED SKIN IN ALL THE PINK COUNTRY
WHY THAT WAS A MAGIC NIGHT WASN'T IT THERE'S DIFF'RENT SORTS O NIGHTS MATE SAID THE SAILOR AN THE KNIGHT BUTTON-BRIGHT MEANS AIN'T THE SAME NIGHT YOU MEAN
THEN HE HALTED AND FACED CAP'N BILL
THEIR DRESSES CONSISTED OF LAYER AFTER LAYER OF GAUZY TUCKS AND RUFFLES AND LACES CAUGHT HERE AND THERE WITH BOWS OF DAINTY RIBBON
AND WOULD YOU PREFER TO GO HOME TO REMAINING HERE WE WOULD INDEED THEN WHY DO YOU NOT GET THE UMBRELLA HOW ASKED TROT EAGERLY
THE GOAT DISCOVERED HIM AND TRIED TO MAKE A RUSH BUT THE ROPE HELD THE ANIMAL BACK AND WHEN THE CAPTAIN SAW THIS HE CAME FORWARD MORE BOLDLY
BY L
HOWEVER AS THE TWO FORCES CAME NEARER TOGETHER BUTTON-BRIGHT SPIED TROT AND CAP'N BILL STANDING BEFORE THE ENEMY AND THE SIGHT ASTONISHED HIM CONSIDERABLY
PUBLISHERS SKY ISLAND BEING THE FURTHER EXCITING ADVENTURES OF TROT AND CAP'N BILL AFTER THEIR VISIT TO THE SEA FAIRIES BY L
THEN ESCORT THOSE GIRLS TO THEIR ROOMS LOCK EM IN AN PUT A GUARD BEFORE THE DOOR AT ONCE THE SOLDIERS SEIZED THE PRINCESSES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR SNARLS AND STRUGGLES MARCHED THEM TO THEIR ROOMS AND LOCKED THEM IN
LET'S GO THEN SAID THE GIRL JUMPING UP
THEY WRONGED US BY COMING HERE THEY COULD NOT HELP DOING THAT ARGUED CORALIE AND IT IS THEIR MISFORTUNE THAT THEY ARE HERE ON SKY ISLAND AT ALL
ANYHOW WE'RE IN FOR IT ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE WAR OF THE PINKS AND BLUES CHAPTER 19
A BOAT CAN'T LAND HERE
WASN'T IT JUS THE--THE FASCINATINGEST RIDE YOU EVER TOOK CAP'N IT'S PRETTY GOOD FUN ADMITTED CAP'N BILL
WHEN OUR SIX HUNDRED YEARS ARE ENDED WE MARCH INTO THE GREAT BLUE GROTTO THROUGH THE ARCH OF PHINIS AND ARE NEVER SEEN AGAIN THAT'S QUEER SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
TIGGLE IS IN HIDING SOMEWHERE
KNOWING HE WAS HELPLESS HE MADE NO PROTEST WHEN THEY AGAIN BOUND HIM AND CARRIED HIM DOWN THE LADDER LIKE A BALE OF GOODS
NO ONE RESTRAINED THEM OR INTERFERED WITH THEM IN ANY WAY
IT WAS LOCKED BUT THE KEY HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE
THEY WERE MAGNIFICENTLY DRESSED AND THEIR BLUE HAIR WAS CAREFULLY ARRANGED IN HUGE TOWERS UPON THEIR HEADS WITH BLUE PLUMES STUCK INTO THE TOPS
IN THAT CASE MY SUBJECTS WOULD JUSTLY GROW ENVIOUS OF MY SUPERIOR STATION
THE HOUSES WERE BIG AND SUBSTANTIAL ALL ROUND IN SHAPE WITH DOMED ROOFS AND CIRCULAR WINDOWS AND DOORWAYS
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATED BY JOHN R
NOW I CAN CLIMB UP DON'T YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT A LITTLE WISTFULLY
ONE OF THEM IN HIS CURIOSITY TO EXAMINE THE BLUE CITY GOT A LITTLE TOO NEAR THE WALL AND A BLUE SOLDIER THROW HIS CORD-AND-WEIGHT AT HIM
THE OFFICER WITH THE BLUE-GOLD CHAIN PULLED BUTTON-BRIGHT'S SLEEVE AND WHISPERED
HAS ANYONE EVER COME OUT OF THAT ARCH ALIVE HE ASKED
AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE THE INVADERS WERE CAREFUL TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE WALL
SO CAP'N BILL HELD THE BOOLOOROO AND THE GIRL TIED HIM FAST IN POSITION AS CAP'N BILL HAD BEEN TIED SO THAT HIS MAJESTY COULDN'T WIGGLE AT ALL
HE COULDN'T SAY WHY NOT KNOWING ITS EARLY HISTORY BUT HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF I LOST THE UMBRELLA BAD LUCK WOULD HAPPEN TO US
I'LL HOLD ON TO THE HANDLE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT AND SHE CAN HOLD ON TO ME
BY THE TIME THE ARMY RECOVERED THEIR WITS AND PREPARED TO OBEY IT WAS TOO LATE
AND FEED MY LOVELY BLUE PEACOCK THAT MEWS LIKE A CAT SAID PRINCESS CERULIA
CAP'N BILL HAD TO MIND HIS WOODEN LEG CAREFULLY AND THE OLD SAILOR WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE MUMBLED QUEER SENTENCES ABOUT ARABY ANN KNIGHTS AND DING-DONGED MAGIC AND THE FOOL FOOLISHNESS OF FUSSIN WITH WITCHES AN SICH UNTIL TROT WONDERED WHETHER HER OLD FRIEND HAD GONE CRAZY OR WAS ONLY BADLY SCARED
NOW SHE SAID TO THEM YOU WILL BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DEFEAT THE BLUESKINS WHATEVER THEY MAY DO THE PINKIES WERE OVERJOYED AT THIS PROMISE AND IT MADE THEM VERY BRAVE INDEED SINCE THEY NOW BELIEVED THEY WOULD SURELY BE VICTORIOUS
IT WAS THE PARROT THAT AROUSED THEM
WHEN THEY SAW HOW THE BOOLOOROO'S PRECIOUS PRISONER WAS ESCAPING THEY INSTANTLY BECAME ALERT AND WIDE-AWAKE AND EVERY ONE STARTED IN PURSUIT ALONG THE FOOT OF THE WALL
YOUR DUTY WILL BE TO KEEP THE BOOTS AND SHOES OF THE ROYAL FAMILY NICELY POLISHED WITH BLUE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANSWERED BUTTON-BRIGHT SURLILY
AND FEED MY FUZZY BLUE RABBIT THAT ROARS LIKE A LION SAID PRINCESS TURQUOISE
HOLD TIGHT TROT
THE BOOLOOROO SAID NOT A WORD WHILE HE WAS RINGING THE BELLS AND TROT WONDERED IF THAT WAS THE WAY HE AMUSED HIMSELF
BUT HE'S GONE MOST OF THE TIME SAILIN ON HIS SHIP
BUT IT WAS TUCKED AWAY UP IN OUR ATTIC AN NO ONE EVER USED IT CAUSE IT WASN'T PRETTY ILLUSTRATION DON'T BLAME EM MUCH REMARKED CAP'N BILL GAZING AT IT CURIOUSLY
ANYHOW THE SAILOR REMARKED THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE OF EVER GETT'N HOME AGAIN
IN THE CITY WERE ANSWERING SHOUTS
BUT THEY WERE TOO LATE
DROP THAT UMBREL--DROP IT YELLED CAP'N BILL AND THE BOOLOOROO QUICKLY OBEYED
THEY WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT CAP'N BILL'S GREAT SIZE AND WOODEN LEG--TWO VERY UNUSUAL THINGS IN THEIR EXPERIENCE--AND THE OLD SAILOR FRIGHTENED MORE THAN ONE PINKY BOY AND GIRL AND SENT THEM SCAMPERING INTO THE HOUSES WHERE THEY VIEWED THE PASSING PROCESSION FROM BEHIND THE WINDOW SHUTTERS IN COMPARATIVE SAFETY
TELL ME WHERE CAP'N BILL IS I CAN'T SAID TIGGLE
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER MY NAME BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOING TO LIVE HERE YOU ARE SURE TO HEAR OF ME A GREAT MANY TIMES
HE WORE A SAILOR SHIRT WITH A BROAD COLLAR A SHORT PEAJACKET AND WIDE-BOTTOMED SAILOR TROUSERS ONE LEG OF WHICH COVERED HIS WOODEN LIMB BUT DID NOT HIDE IT
BUT WHO ARE YOU PLEASE MY NAME IS GHIP-GHI-SIZ-ZLE
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION TROT CELEBRATES HER VICTORY CHAPTER 26
ONCE FREE OF THE CITY THEY TRAVERSED THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HERE THEY OFTEN STEPPED INTO STICKY PINK MUD UP TO THEIR ANKLES
I'D RATHER BE PATCHED THAN MISMATCHED AS I WOULD BE WITH A LOVELY SNUBNOSED WIFE
IT'S CAP'N BILL SO THE BOY RAN OUT OF HIS TENT TO FIND THE SAILOR HURRYING ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
WHEE-E-E-E
THEIR STICKS WERE TWICE AS LONG AS THOSE OF THE PINKIES AND THE BOOLOOROO CHUCKLED WITH GLEE TO THINK WHAT FUN THEY WOULD HAVE IN PUNCHING HOLES IN THE ROUND FAT BODIES OF HIS ENEMIES
I'M SUMMAT OF AN INVENTOR MYSELF THOUGH THERE AIN'T ANY MAGIC ABOUT ME THEN HE BROUGHT FROM THE SHED THE CONTRIVANCE HE HAD MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE
AS SHE ENTERED THIS ROOM TROT GAVE A START OF FEAR FOR A TERRIBLE ROAR LIKE THE ROAR OF A LION GREETED HER
COME IN THE HOUSE MY POOR BOY AN REST YOURSELF
TROT PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR PAID NO ATTENTION TO THESE COMMANDS
THEY'RE TOO TIGHT SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS SAPPHIRE BRING HITHER MY BOX OF BLUE CHOCOLATES SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS AZURE STAND BY MY SIDE AND FAN ME SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS INDIGO GET OUT OF THAT CHAIR
THEY CAME RATHER HALTINGLY THOUGH AND THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS FIRST PUT HIS HEAD CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DOORWAY TO SEE IF THE COAST WAS CLEAR
TROT WAS IN THE ROOM TOO STANDING IN A CORNER AND LISTENING TO ALL THAT WAS SAID WHILE SHE RACKED HER LITTLE BRAIN FOR AN IDEA THAT WOULD ENABLE HER TO SAVE CAP'N BILL FROM BEING PATCHED
THE ISLAND WAS NOW FAR BEHIND THEM GROWING SMALL IN THE DISTANCE
I HATE THOSE BLUESKINS
AT ONCE THE UMBRELLA ROSE INTO THE AIR LIFTING AFTER IT FIRST THE SEAT IN WHICH THE CHILDREN SAT AND THEN CAP'N BILL'S SEAT
THEN LOOKING UP AT THE UMBRELLA HE REPEATED DISTINCTLY
IN A TWINKLING THE FROGS ALL TURNED AND MADE THE LONGEST LEAPS THEIR POWERFUL LEGS ENABLED THEM TO
NEVER MIND SAID THE BOOLOOROO I'LL ATTEND TO THEM IN A MINUTE
NOT IN THE BLUE PART OF SKY ISLAND REPLIED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE WAS THE REPLY
PERHAPS I'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE CAP'N BILL MYSELF
THE FURNISHINGS WERE OF THE UTMOST SPLENDOR BLUE-GOLD AND BLUE GEMS BEING PROFUSELY USED IN THE DECORATIONS WHILE THE DIVANS AND CHAIRS WERE OF RICHLY CARVED BLUEWOOD UPHOLSTERED IN BLUE SATINS AND SILKS
THIS WAS DONE THE ONCE ROYAL FAMILY DEPARTING FROM THE PALACE WITH SHAMED AND DOWNCAST LOOKS
THE PINKIES WOULD NOT DANCE WITH THE BLUES HOWEVER NOR WOULD THE BLUES DANCE WITH THE PINKIES
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO HOLD IT UP YOU KNOW WHAT'S HOLDING US UP ASKED TROT
WHILE HE STOOD IN THE CORRIDOR WONDERING WHAT TO DO NEXT A SUDDEN SHOUTING REACHED HIS EARS
ITS POWERFUL HIND LEGS STRAIGHTENED LIKE STEEL SPRINGS AND SHOT THE BIG BODY WITH ITS PASSENGERS THROUGH THE FOG LIKE AN ARROW LAUNCHED FROM A BOW
THE BOY WAS BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT
IT'S NO DISGRACE TO BE PATCHED IN A COUNTRY RULED BY SUCH A CRUEL BOOLOOROO AS WE HAVE
YOU SEE REMARKED JIMFRED AS THEY SEATED THEMSELVES AGAIN UPON THE BENCH THE BOOLOOROO HAS ORDERED THE PATCHING TO TAKE PLACE TO-MORROW MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH OF THIS BLUE COUNTRY AND ITS BLUE BOOLOOROO I GUESS AN IT'S A LONG JOURNEY BACK AGAIN ALL RIGHT AGREED TROT JUMPING UP
THEY GASPED FOR BREATH AND TRIED TO HANG ON AND THEN SUDDENLY THE FROG LANDED JUST AT THE EDGE OF THE FOG BANK STOPPING SO ABRUPTLY THAT HIS THREE RIDERS LEFT HIS BACK AND SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HIM
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PRISONER BY DARING TO LAY HANDS UPON ME
MAGIC HE OBSERVED GRAVELY WAS ONCE LYIN ROUND LOOSE IN THE WORLD
THE THREE WALKED SILENTLY ALONG THE PATH
BUT NONE THAT WE CAN CALL TO OUR ASSISTANCE OR COMMAND TO DO OUR BIDDING HOW ABOUT WITCHES ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
WELL THAT HAS ITS ADVANTIDGES AN ITS DISADVANTIDGES
WE MUST MAKE FOR THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HIDE IN THE FOG BANK OR IN THE ARCH OF PHINIS REPLIED THE BOY
CAP'N BILL IS GOIN TO BE MY GENERAL O THE ARMY AN THE ROYAL MANAGER O THE BLUE COUNTRY CONTINUED TROT
JUST AT THE BOY'S FEET CROUCHED A MONSTROUS ANIMAL OF MOST FEARFUL ASPECT
DOESN'T IT HURT NO
BUT THE PINKIES WERE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER TO BE CAUGHT IN THIS MANNER AND NOW BY COMMAND OF CAP'N BILL THEY SUDDENLY ROSE TO THEIR FEET AND BEGAN JABBING THEIR STICKS AT THE FOE
THEY PASSED THIS BLUESKIN WITHOUT DISTURBING HIM AND SOON REACHED THE CHAMBER OPPOSITE THE SUITE OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WHOM THEY COULD HEAR STILL QUARRELING LOUDLY AMONG THEMSELVES
THE MOON SHINES HERE EVERY NIGHT BUT WE NEVER SEE THE SUN
THEY HAD HAD NO SLEEP AND IT WAS A LONG TIME PAST MIDNIGHT
THE BLUE CAT WAS ASLEEP ON A WINDOW SEAT BUT IT WOKE UP WHEN TROT TENDERLY TOOK IT IN HER LAP AND FED IT MILK FROM A BLUE-GOLD DISH
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE CAP'N BILL AND THERE'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER
WHAT SHALL WE DO ROSALIE
SO THERE BEING NO OBJECT IN HIS REMAINING LONGER IN THE ROOM WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO FIGHT THE WOLF AGAIN BUTTON-BRIGHT WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT MYSELF RETURNED GHIP-GHISIZZLE WITH A SIGH
AND THE PINKIES ARE ANXIOUS TO GET HOME ADDED ROSALIE WHO WAS PRESENT
BEG PARDING I'M SURE EXCLAIMED CAP'N BILL BACKING AWAY
BUT I HAVE RECOVERED THE BOOK OF ROYAL RECORDS WHICH HAS LONG BEEN HIDDEN IN THE TREASURE CHAMBER AND BY READING IT I FIND THAT THE BOOLOOROO IS NOT YOUR LAWFUL BOOLOOROO AT ALL HAVING REIGNED MORE THAN HIS THREE HUNDRED YEARS
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING HERE YET THAT REMINDS ME OF FAIRIES
INVISIBLE TROT FOLLOWED SOBERLY AFTER THEM STILL WONDERING WHAT SHE COULD DO TO SAVE HER FRIEND
INSTEAD SHE TOLD ME TO GO UP IN THE ATTIC AND PLAY
I DON'T KNOW
HAVE ONE SHE SAID
ON SKY ISLAND--AT LEAST ON THE PINK SIDE--THE SUN AROSE IN WONDERFUL SPLENDOR BUT ALSO IT SET IN A BLAZE OF GLORY AND SO THERE WERE ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES AND FOR WANT OF SOMETHING BETTER TO ARGUE ABOUT THE PINKIES TOOK THIS QUEER SUBJECT AS A CAUSE OF DISPUTE
ONLY A FEW OF THE BLUESKINS WERE SOLDIERS AND THESE ALL BELONGED TO THE KING'S BODYGUARD BUT THE CITIZENS REALIZED THEY MUST INDEED FIGHT BRAVELY TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HURT SO THEY PROMISED THE BOOLOOROO TO DO ALL THEY COULD
I WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO COME AWAY AGAIN YOU KNOW NO OF COURSE NOT SAID TROT
I WISH MOTHER COULD SEE ME RULIN THE PINKIES--AN PAPA GRIFFITH TOO
WHEN TIGGLE HAD SAFELY ESCAPED THE LITTLE GIRL WANDERED THROUGH THE PALACE IN SEARCH OF CAP'N BILL BUT SOON DECIDED SUCH A QUEST IN THE DARK WAS LIKELY TO FAIL AND SHE MUST WAIT UNTIL MORNING
BUT I HOPE TO GROW IN TIME
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE SAID TROT GRAVELY
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED AND YOU ARE NOW A POWERFUL RULER REPLIED ROSALIE
HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED KIND TREATMENT IN ALL HIS LIFE
SO THE SUN REALLY LOSES ITSELF IN THE CLOUDS AN LEAVES A TRAIL OF BEAUTY BEHIND HIM HE DOES THAT AGREED TROT
THE BLUE PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME DAZED WITH WONDER AT ALL THE EVENTS THAT HAD TRANSPIRED THAT EVENTFUL DAY BUT THEY STILL HAD WIT ENOUGH TO BE GLAD THE WAR WAS OVER
THE BOOLOOROO HAS NO RIGHT TO MAKE ME DO HIS DIRTY WORK YOU'RE A SLAVE THE OFFICER REMINDED HIM
I'M TOLD THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO SPEAK TO A QUEEN PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
CAN THEY DO ANYTHING USEFUL ASKED THE FIFTH
AT ONCE THERE WAS WAR
HE DID NOT APPROVE THE WAY THE STRANGERS WERE BEING TREATED AND THOUGHT IT WAS WICKED AND CRUEL TO TRY TO DESTROY THEM
AND I KNOW THERE'S MAGIC STILL IN THE WORLD--OR IN MY UMBRELLA ANYHOW TELL US ABOUT IT BEGGED THE GIRL EXCITEDLY
THE SOLDIERS WORE THEIR BEST BLUE UNIFORMS AND WERE FORMED BEFORE THE PALACE IN MARCHING ORDER SO TROT AND CAP'N BILL HEADED THE PROCESSION AND THEN CAME THE SOLDIERS--ALL KEEPING STEP--AND THEN THE BANDS PLAYING VERY LOUD NOISES ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AND FINALLY THE CROWD OF BLUE CITIZENS WAVING FLAGS AND BANNERS AND SHOUTING JOYFULLY
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE FUN THERE IS GOING CONTINUED THE GIRL FOR WE ARE TO ENTERTAIN THE ARMY OF THE PINKIES THE PINKIES EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
GO IN THEN SAID HE
THE COLOR SEEMS ALL WRONG BUT IT MAY TASTE JUS AS GOOD AS IF IT WAS RED EVIDENTLY IT DID TASTE GOOD FOR THE RABBIT ATE IT GREEDILY
THEN SHE STOOD BACK AND WATCHED THE BOOLOOROO AND JUST AS HE PULLED THE CORD SHE PULLED ON HER ROPE AND DRAGGED THE FRAME ON ITS ROLLERS AWAY SO THAT THE GREAT KNIFE FELL WITH A CRASH AND SLICED NOTHING BUT THE AIR
THE ARMY HAD BEEN VERY FEARFUL AND WEAK-KNEED WHEN IT FIRST ENTERED THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT PERCEIVING THAT THE BOOLOOROO AND HIS PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND HAD LOCKED THEMSELVES UP IN THE CITY THE PINKIES GREW BOLDER AND LONGED TO MAKE AN ATTACK
YOU MUST STAY TO LEAD THE ARMY
AND IT ISN'T SKY ISLAND ANYHOW THIS MISER'BLE OL UMBREL IS TOO PERTIC'LER GROWLED CAP'N BILL
OH THAT'S WORSE THAN BEING PATCHED CRIED TROT
THE TWO MEN WALKED ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM HOLDING THE POINTED STICKS READY TO JAB THEM IF THEY ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND THE TWO WOMEN FOLLOWED IN THE REAR ALSO ARMED WITH SHARP STICKS
THEN THE BOOLOOROO TOLD ONE OF THE SOLDIERS TO TAKE THE BOY TO THE SHOEBLUE DEN AND HAVE HIM INSTRUCTED IN HIS DUTIES AND THE SOLDIER PROMPTLY OBEYED AND DRAGGED BUTTON-BRIGHT AWAY TO THE END OF THE PALACE WHERE THE SERVANTS LIVED
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE HER THE QUEEN I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT SAID TROT
AREN'T WE ALREADY LOST IN THIS FOG NOT YET SAID CAP'N BILL
GET ALL THE SOLDIERS TOGETHER AND TELL ALL THE PEOPLE THERE'S GOING TO BE A HIGH TIME IN THE BLUE CITY TO-NIGHT
AIN'T THERE ANY BLAMED WAY AT ALL TO STOP HER NONE THAT I KNOW OF SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT ANXIOUSLY
WHAT D YE THINK O THAT MR BOOLOOROO ASKED CAP'N BILL
WE BREATHE THE AIR AN WE CAN BREATHE IT HIGH UP JUST AS WELL AS DOWN ON THE EARTH SEEIN AS YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH TROT IT WOULD BE CRUEL FOR ME TO GO WITH BUTT'N-BRIGHT AN LEAVE YOU AT HOME SAID THE SAILOR
AS THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS NOW CLEARED OF ALL BUT CAP'N BILL--WHO WAS TIED IN HIS FRAME--AND OF TROT AND THE MOANING BOOLOOROO WHO LAY HIDDEN BEHIND THE BENCHES THE GOAT GAVE A VICTORIOUS BLEAT AND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY TO FACE ANY ENEMY THAT MIGHT APPEAR
AFTER A PLEASANT EVENING DURING WHICH NO REFERENCE WAS MADE TO THEIR BEING PRISONERS THEY WERE SHOWN TO PRETTILY FURNISHED ROOMS--ALL IN PINK--AND SLEPT SOUNDLY IN THE SOFT BEDS PROVIDED FOR THEM
THE PERSON WHETHER MAN OR WOMAN BOY OR GIRL LIVING IN THE PINK COUNTRY WHO HAS THE LIGHTEST SKIN SHALL BE THE RULER--KING OR QUEEN--AS LONG AS HE OR SHE LIVES UNLESS SOME ONE OF A LIGHTER SKIN IS FOUND AND THIS RULER'S COMMANDS ALL THE PEOPLE MUST OBEY DO YOU KNOW THIS LAW OH YES REPLIED TOURMALINE
HI THERE HE CRIED
OF COURSE NOT SAID THE BOOLOOROO
HOW CAN WE JOG TO A FROG IN A FOG THE BIG FROG SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DIFFICULTY FOR HE KEPT MAKING NOISES IN HIS THROAT TO GUIDE THEM TO WHERE HE HAD LEAPED
ONCE THEY PASSED BETWEEN TWO SMALL STARS AS BRILLIANT AS DIAMONDS AND ONCE AN ENORMOUS BIRD WHOSE WINGS SPREAD SO WIDE THAT THEY SHADOWED THE SUN SOARED DIRECTLY OVER THEM AND LOST ITSELF IN THE VAGUE DISTANCE OF THE LIMITLESS SKY
HOLD ON THERE CRIED CAP'N BILL
BUT NEVERTHELESS IT IS CERTAIN THAT HAD NOT THE TERRIBLE FOG BANK STOOD BETWEEN THEM AND THE PINK LAND MOST OF THE INVADING ARMY WOULD HAVE PROMPTLY DESERTED AND GONE BACK HOME
ALL THE PINKIES PRESENT BOWED VERY RESPECTFULLY TO ROSALIE WHO RETURNED THE SALUTATION WITH A DIGNIFIED NOD
AFTER THE PINKIES HAD BEEN DISMISSED THEIR NEW QUEEN ROSALIE BY MEANS OF A CLEVER CHARM CONJURED UP A DINNER TABLE SET WITH VERY NICE THINGS TO EAT
YES YOU WOULD
NOT BEING ABLE TO SETTLE THE QUESTION THEY FINALLY LOCKED HIM UP IN A VACANT ROOM ACROSS THE HALL AND TOLD HIM HE MUST STAY THERE UNTIL HE HAD DECIDED TO MARRY ONE OF THE PRINCESSES AND COULD MAKE A CHOICE AMONG THEM
IN ESCAPING FROM THE PALACE TROT HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE ALL THE PETS BEHIND HER BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE PARROT HAD FOUND SOME WAY TO GET FREE AND FOLLOW HER
WE ARE THEY CRIED
WE CAN'T MOVE A STEP TILL YOU ARE GONE DON'T DISTURB ME SAID THE LIZARD
RIDDLECUM RIDDLECUM REE
HE HAD A WAY OF COUGHING WHEN HE WAS SUSPICIOUS
SO THEY SHOUTED THEIR APPROVAL VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND PRESSED FORWARD ONE BY ONE TO KNEEL BEFORE THEIR NEW RULER AND KISS HER HAND
AND NOW LET US CONSULT TOGETHER HOW BEST TO TAKE THE BLUE CITY AND CAPTURE THE BOOLOOROO
THEREFORE IF YOU WILL PLEASE BE PATIENT FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS YOU WILL DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE WHO BREAKS THE LAW THANK'E REMARKED CAP'N BILL
GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAD BEEN THINKING DEEPLY UPON THIS DISCOVERY AND HE DECIDED THAT IF ANYONE ENTERED HIS ROOM HE WOULD GET THROUGH THE WINDOW LEAP DOWN UPON THE WALL AND TRY IN THIS WAY TO ESCAPE
HERE ARE THREE STRANGE PEOPLE TOURMALINE WAS THE REPLY WHO SAY THEY HAVE ENTERED OUR COUNTRY THROUGH THE FOG BANK
I AM ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE THE RAINBOW WHICH IS A SIGN THAT THE SUN WILL SHINE AGAIN LOOKS LIKE RAIN NOW REMARKED CAP'N BILL
SUDDENLY THE BASKET THAT WAS DANGLING BELOW CAP'N BILL'S SEAT STRUCK SOMETHING WITH A LOUD THUD AND THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A YELL OF ANGER
IT DOESN'T HURT REPLIED JIMFRED BUT IT MAKES ONE FRIGHTFULLY NERVOUS
IT AIN'T THAT AT ALL
WE MAY AS WELL GO BACK AND REPORT THE MATTER TO THE BOOLOOROO ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THROUGH THE FOG BANK CHAPTER 12
HOW DARE YOU SPEAK WHEN I'M TALKING SHE TURNED TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AND HER TONE CHANGED TO ONE OF MUCH GENTLENESS AS SHE SAID
POLYCHROME NOW DISMISSED ALL BUT BUTTON-BRIGHT CAP'N BILL ROSALIE THE WITCH AND THE NEW QUEEN OF THE PINKIES
YOU ARE A SLAVE SHOUTED THE SIX ALL TOGETHER
IS THE PINK SIDE OF SKY ISLAND BIGGER THAN THE BLUE SIDE ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
AFTER A HURRIED CONSULTATION THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES DECIDED TO HIDE THE MAJORDOMO IN ONE OF THEIR BOUDOIRS SO THEY DRAGGED HIM UP THE STAIRS TO THEIR RECEPTION ROOM AND FELL TO QUARRELING AS TO WHOSE BOUDOIR SHOULD BE OCCUPIED BY THEIR CAPTIVE
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
POLYCHROME STRAIGHTENED UP AND GLANCED AT HER SISTERS
THE BOY NODDED

ALL WERE SET UPON NICELY CARVED PINK PEDESTALS
BUT THE TWO-SIDED MAN HAD OVERHEARD THE REMARK AND HE NOW STEPPED FORWARD AND SAID IN A CARELESS TONE
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW REPLIED THE WITCH GREATLY PERPLEXED
WHEN THEY FIRST REACHED THE RECEPTION ROOM PRINCESS AZURE CAST HERSELF UPON A DIVAN WHILE HER FIVE SISTERS SAT OR RECLINED IN EASY CHAIRS WITH THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR BLUE CHINS SCORNFULLY ELEVATED
THE BILLYGOAT IS THE VERY BEST GUARD WE COULD HAVE FOR EVER'BODY'S FRAID O HIM REMARKED CAP'N BILL AS HE PUT THE KEY OF THE ROOM IN HIS POCKET
CAP'N BILL'S WOODEN LEG WOULD OFTEN GO DOWN DEEP AND STICK FAST IN THIS MUD AND AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD BE HELPLESS UNTIL TWO OF THE PINKIES--WHO WERE A STRONG PEOPLE--PULLED HIM OUT AGAIN
THE FRAMES WERE SPLIT INTO SMALL PIECES OF BLUEWOOD AND THE BENCHES CHOPPED INTO KINDLING AND THE IMMENSE SHARP KNIFE BROKEN INTO BITS
BUT BEIN AS YOU'RE FRIENDLY TO US YOU AIN'T IN ANY DANGER THE SAILOR THOUGHT THIS SPEECH WAS DIPLOMATIC AND MIGHT HEAD OFF ANY TROUBLE BUT THE PINKIES SEEMED UNEASY AND SEVERAL OF THEM PICKED UP THEIR SLENDER POINTED STICKS AND HELD THEM IN THEIR HANDS
CAP'N BILL HAD A WAY OF GROWING MORE AND MORE CHEERFUL WHEN DANGER THREATENED
LIKE CAP'N BILL HE HAD NO ROOM TO SHIVER BUT HE GROANED VERY DISMALLY AND WAS SO FULL OF FEAR THAT HIS BLUE HAIR NEARLY STOOD ON END
BUT YOU WERE MISTAKEN
HIS ARMS WERE TIED TO HIS BODY AND HIS BODY WAS TIED FAST TO THE LOUNGE
HELLO ANSWERED TROT LOOKING UP SURPRISED
HE WAS AFRAID TO BE SURE AND HIS HEART WAS BEATING FAST WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT BUT HE KNEW HE MUST REGAIN THE MAGIC UMBRELLA IF HE WOULD SAVE HIS COMRADES AND HIMSELF FROM DESTRUCTION FOR WITHOUT IT THEY COULD NEVER RETURN TO THE EARTH
OUR BOOLOOROO IS NOT VERY TRUTHFUL I ADMIT FOR HE IS TRYING TO MISREPRESENT THE LENGTH OF HIS REIGN BUT OUR PEOPLE AS A RULE SPEAK ONLY THE TRUTH SO DO WE ASSERTED CAP'N BILL
AS THE GIRL WALKED THROUGH THESE PASSAGES SHE COULD HEAR SNORES OF VARIOUS DEGREES COMING FROM BEHIND SOME OF THE CLOSED DOORS AND KNEW THAT ALL THE REGULAR INMATES OF THE PLACE WERE SOUND ASLEEP
THE RULER BE IT KING OR QUEEN HAS ABSOLUTE POWER TO RULE BUT NO RICHES--NO HIGH STATION--NO FALSE ADULATION
I WANT TO GO TO THE TOWN OVER YONDER HE SAID POINTING WITH HIS FINGER TO THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES THAT SHOWED AROUND THE BEND IN THE CLIFF
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE GIRL AND THE BOOLOOROO CHAPTER 23
IT KEPT RIGHT ON FLYING AND I SHUT MY EYES AND HELD ON
FLOODS AND GUSHES FILL OUR PATH THIS IS NOT MY DAY FOR A BATH
SAID HE
TOURMALINE'S EYES WERE SO DEEP A SHADE OF PINK THAT THEY WERE ALMOST HAZEL AND HER HAIR WAS DARKER THAN THAT OF THE OTHERS BEING A GOLDEN-RED IN COLOR
ONCE REMARKED CAP'N BILL I SAWR A PICTER OF YOU IN AN ALMANAC AH
THE PRINCESS WAS TWICE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SIZE AND SHE SHOOK HER VICTIM SO VIOLENTLY THAT TROT'S TEETH RATTLED TOGETHER
THEN TOURMALINE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE OF THE THREE STRANGERS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF DECIDING WHAT TO DO WITH THEM
IT WAS THE VOICE OF THE BOOLOOROO CRYING
WHAT CAN BE DONE ASKED THE GIRL
DIDN'T YOU LIKE IT TOO CAP'N BILL PARTS O IT MATE THE SAILOR ANSWERED AS HE THOUGHTFULLY MADE MARKS IN THE SAND WITH THE END OF HIS WOODEN LEG
TROT KNEW SHE WOULD NEVER RETURN TO SKY ISLAND BUT SHE DID NOT TELL THEM THAT
ALL RIGHT CAP'N SHE SAID IN A SATISFIED TONE I GUESS WE CAN RUN THIS BLUE COUNTRY OURSELVES AFTER THIS THE BOOLOOROO WAS TERRIFIED TO FIND HIMSELF IN DANGER OF BEING SLICED BY THE SAME KNIFE HE HAD SO OFTEN WICKEDLY EMPLOYED TO SLICE OTHERS
I'M QUEEN OF THE PINKIES AN I'M ALSO QUEEN OF THE BLUES SO I WON'T HAVE MY PEOPLE QUARRELING
WHAT'S GOIN TO HAPPEN TO THIS TOUGH OL WARRIOR TROT ASKED CAP'N BILL
HERE WAS A TINY BABY LAMB WITH FLEECE AS BLUE AS A LARKSPUR AND AS SOFT AS SILK
AN I'LL HAVE A PRETTY FENCE PUT AROUND IT AN MAKE ALL THE PEOPLE HONOR AN RESPEC HIM JUS AS LONG AS HE LIVES I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BOOLOOROO
PRETTY SOON THE GREAT FROGS APPEARED A LONG LINE OF THEM FACING TROT AND HER PINK ARMY AND SITTING UPON THEIR HAUNCHES CLOSE TOGETHER
TROT DECIDED THESE BLUESKINS MUST HAVE STOLEN INTO THE GARDEN WHEN SUMMONED BY THE BELLS THE BOOLOOROO HAD RUNG BUT THEY HAD KEPT OUT OF SIGHT AND CREPT UP BEHIND THE BENCH ON WHICH OUR FRIENDS WERE SEATED UNTIL A SIGNAL FROM THE KING AROUSED THEM TO ACTION
THEN HE DREAMED ABOUT IT AND WAKING OR DREAMING HE FOUND THE TALE HARD TO BELIEVE
THE COLORS FADED THE ARCH SLOWLY DISSOLVED AND THE HEAVENS WERE CLEAR
HALF A MILE DISTANT WAS A LARGE CITY ITS PINK TINTINGS GLISTENING BRAVELY IN THE PINK SUNSHINE WHILE HUNDREDS OF PINK BANNERS FLOATED FROM ITS NUMEROUS DOMES
BUT HE NEVER WILL CONSENT
NO ONE CAN LIVE THERE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A ROUND COLD BARREN BALL OF MUD AND WATER DECLARED THE BLUESKIN
HOLD ON A MINUTE BUTT'N-BRIGHT TILL WE CAN LAND AN DRAG IT ASHORE HOLD ON A MINUTE UMBRELLA CRIED THE BOY
ARE YOU ALL CONTENTED PINKIES SHE ASKED TURNING TO THE PEOPLE
ONLY TROUBLE IS YOU GO TOO FAST BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS SMILING CONTENTEDLY
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE ELEPHANT'S HEAD COMES TO LIFE CHAPTER 28
THAT FILLS THE BILL AN DON'T NEED PERNOUNCIN ALL RIGHT SHE SAID
IF THEY HADN'T TAKEN THE UMBRELLA I WOULDN'T CARE HOW LONG WE STOPPED IN THIS FUNNY ISLAND
I'M NOT OUR FATHER THE REVERED AND RESPLENDENT ROYAL RULER OF THE BLUES HAS MADE YOU OUR SLAVE ASSERTED INDIGO WITH A YAWN
YOU MISERABLE WHITE-SKINNED CREATURES
THE SOLDIERS OBEYED READILY AND WHEN TROT AND CAP'N BILL WERE LEFT ALONE THEY TURNED THE GOAT LOOSE IN THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND THEN LOCKED THE ANIMAL IN WITH THE BOOLOOROO
THE GIRL AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE ALL RATHER DISCOURAGED BY THIS TIME FOR THEY HAD SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW AND HAD NOT FOUND A TRACE OF THE ALL-IMPORTANT UMBRELLA
PRESENTLY THEY PAUSED BEFORE A GRIM ARCHWAY OF BLUE MARBLE ABOVE WHICH WAS CARVED THE ONE WORD
THERE ARE NONE HERE IN THE FOG BANK SO THE BEST I CAN DO IS DREAM OF THEM
BUT SEEIN AS THE BLUE BOOLOOROO HAS LOCKED IT UP IN HIS TREASURE CHAMBER IT MAYN'T BE EASY TO GET HOLD OF NO
SO TROT SENT FOR THE ROYAL SCRIBBLER WHO WAS A VERY FAT PINKY WITH LARGE PINK EYES AND CURLY PINK HAIR AND HAD HIM CAREFULLY WRITE THE NEW LAW IN THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS
HOW DARE YOU SIT IN OUR PRESENCE IF YOU'RE SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS TO ME REPLIED TROT YOU MAY AS WELL SAVE YOUR BREATH
WHEN THAT'S DONE WE CAN GO HOME ANY TIME WE WANT TO QUITE RIGHT TROT SAID THE SAILOR APPROVINGLY
HE USED HIS UMBREL AS A PARA--PARA SHOOT SAID CAP'N BILL
THIS FRAME WAS ON ROLLERS SO THAT IT COULD BE PLACED DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE KNIFE
THE ROYAL STEWARD WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH BLUE PASTE AND WHEN YOU'VE BRUSHED THIS ON OUR SHOES YOU MUST SHINE THEM WITH Q-RAYS OF MOONSHINE
GRADUALLY THIS BLUE BECAME FAINTER UNTIL AS THEY PROGRESSED EVERYTHING BECAME A DULL GRAY
BUT WE'LL SOON FIND OUT AS THEY WALKED DOWN THE STREET THEY OBSERVED THAT THE SKY WAS NOW COVERED WITH DARK CLOUDS WHICH ENTIRELY HID THE SUN
TROT SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
SO YOU KNOW VERY WELL I AIN'T SKEERT ABOUT THE HIGHUPNESS WHY CAN'T WE ALL GO TOGETHER ASKED THE BOY
IT WON'T DO FOR US TO GET CAUGHT NOW PANTED CAP'N BILL AS THEY RAN ALONG
I MUST SURELY MANAGE TO GET MY UMBRELLA FIRST SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
IT MADE A CIRCLE OVER THE COVE AND THEN STARTED STRAIGHT BACK THE WAY IT HAD COME
THERE IS WORK FOR ME TO DO HERE FOR ONE OF MY OLD FRIENDS IS IN TROUBLE WITH THIS SHE SPRANG LIGHTLY FROM THE RAINBOW AND STOOD BESIDE BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT AND SCARCELY HAD SHE LEFT THE SPLENDID ARCH WHEN IT LIFTED AND ROSE INTO THE SKY
I'M A FISH-POND I'M A WELL
JUST AS THE BOY MADE HIS FIRST STEP FORWARD THE BLUE WOLF SPRANG UPON HIM WITH ITS ENORMOUS JAWS STRETCHED WIDE OPEN
WE DID O WONDERFUL WITCH THEY DECLARED
WHEN THE BOOLOOROO'S PEOPLE WERE ARMED WITH LONG THIN LANCES OF BLUEWOOD ALL SHARPENED TO FINE POINTS AT ONE END THEY PREPARED TO MARCH ONCE MORE AGAINST THE INVADERS
THAT'S THE PROPER TALK
THEN THEY ROLLED THE FRAME IN POSITION UNDERNEATH THE GREAT KNIFE AND TROT HELD IN HER HAND THE CORD WHICH WOULD RELEASE IT
THEN THEY RETURNED TO THE PALACE TO BID GOOD-BYE TO GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND THE BLUES
IT THAT TRUE ASKED A PINKY SERIOUSLY
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
DON'T LIKE THAT PLACE CAP'N WHISPERED TROT
IT ISN'T THAT SAID TROT
THE BLUE SOLDIERS PROMPTLY MOUNTED THIS LADDER AND SO GAINED THE WALL HEADING OFF THE FUGITIVE
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION BUTTON-BRIGHT ENCOUNTERS THE BLUE WOLF CHAPTER 11
THE COUNTRY'S PINK BUT WE'LL ALL BE BLUE WHEN TROT GOES HOME AS SHE SAYS SHE'LL DO THEY NOW PACKED THE LUNCH-BASKET WITH THE REMAINS OF THE FEAST FOR THEY KNEW A LONG JOURNEY WAS BEFORE THEM AND FEARED THEY MIGHT BE HUNGRY BEFORE THEY LANDED AGAIN
IF HE DID THERE'S NO NEED FOR HIM TO HIDE ANY LONGER FOR HE IS NOW IN NO DANGER SHE NOW DISPATCHED MESSENGERS ALL THROUGH THE CITY AND THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHO CRIED ALOUD FOR TIGGLE SAYING THAT THE NEW BOOLOOROO WANTED HIM
I'M SORRY FOR HIM MUTTERED JIMFRED
THEY STAND YOU UNDER A BIG KNIFE WHICH DROPS AND SLICES YOU NEATLY IN TWO--EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE
IT ROSE HIGHER THAN BEFORE CARRYING THE THREE VOYAGERS WITH IT AND THEN STARTED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER THE OCEAN
NOW I HAVE MADE A FRIEND OF POLYCHROME AND THAT WILL RENDER ME MORE POWERFUL AS A WITCH FOR I CAN CALL UPON HER FOR ASSISTANCE WHENEVER I NEED HER BUT--SEE HERE SAID CAP'N BILL
AND THEN HE WOULD SCREAM
GOODNESS ME YOUR MAJESTY EXCLAIMED THE FIRST
THE BOY GLANCED AT HIS UMBRELLA AND HUGGED IT TIGHTER
IT WOULD BE A DANGEROUS LEAP FOR AS HIS ARMS WERE BOUND HE MIGHT TOPPLE OFF THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN
SHE SMILED--A LITTLE SADLY--AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON-BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
I'M JUST A COMMON FROG
WHY WE LIVE THERE OURSELVES CRIED TROT
THEY MUST DECIDE UPON ONE FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO AFFORD THEM A FINE TRIP THROUGH THE AIR
THE SAME THING HAPPENED AS BEFORE
GIVE ME TIME AZURE
BUT CAN YOU DO THAT CIRCUS ACT TROT OH I'M GOIN TO STAY HERE AN FIND THE MAGIC UMBRELLA SHE REPLIED
A LITTLE WAY OFF SHE FOUND A BLUESTONE SEAT NEAR TO THE INNER EDGE AND ATTACHING THE LADDER TO THIS SHE EASILY DESCENDED IT AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE BLUE CITY
CAN'T YOU SEE IT LOOKS LIKE IT ADMITTED THE CAPTAIN
TIGGLE THOUGHT HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN SAID HE REMEMBERED SWEEPING THE KING'S ROOMS AND FINDING A QUEER THING--THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN UMBRELLA--LYING BENEATH A CABINET
THAT WILL BE FINE CRIED ALL THE OTHER FIVE AND THE BOOLOOROO SAID
BUT YOU ARE NOT BLUESKINS SO THIS LAW DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU
THE SHAPES SHIFTED HERE AND THERE CONTINUALLY AND THE VOYAGERS BEGAN TO BE BEWILDERED BY THE PHANTOMS
I BELIEVE YOU ARE LIVING IN SKY ISLAND WHERE YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE WITH YOUR HORRID WHITE SKINS
BETWEEN THEM LIES THE GREAT FOG BANK A FOG BANK
THEN SHE LIGHTED THIS POWDER WHICH AT FIRST FLASHED VIVID PINK AND THEN FILLED ALL THE SPACE AROUND THE CHAIR WITH A THICK PINK CLOUD OF SMOKE
IT IS THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY
SKY ISLAND
ILLUSTRATION IT'S A RAIN CLOUD SHE SAID TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AND IT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL BIG ONE CAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG FOR US TO PASS THROUGH IT THE UMBRELLA NEVER HESITATED A MOMENT
THE MAN STIRRED A LITTLE AND ROLLED AGAINST TROT'S KNEE WHEN SHE AT ONCE BECAME VISIBLE TO HIM
AM I RIGHT CAP'N BILL YOU ARE MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR
LIKE ENOUGH SAID HE
HE WORE TIGHT-FITTING CLOTHES MADE OF SKY-BLUE SILK WITH A BROAD BLUE RUFFLE AROUND HIS LONG NECK AND ON HIS BREAST GLITTERED A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN THE FORM OF A STAR SET WITH SPLENDID BLUE STONES
THE CLOAK UNROLLED AS SHE ADVANCED AFFORDING A CONSTANT CARPET FOR HER FEET AND FOR THOSE OF THE OTHERS WHO FOLLOWED HER
AND FEED MY SOFT BLUE LAMB THAT CHATTERS LIKE A MONKEY SAID PRINCESS COBALT
THE JAWS WERE THEREFORE THE DANGEROUS PART OF THE CREATURE AND ITS SMALL BLUE EYES FLASHED WICKEDLY AT THE INTRUDER
ALSO THEY ASSEMBLED IN THE STREETS IN SMALL GROUPS AND TOLD EACH OTHER IN FRIGHTENED WHISPERS THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WAS DUE TO THE BOOLOOROO'S CRUEL TREATMENT OF THE EARTH PEOPLE
YOUR ORDERS MOST MIGHTY FLIGHTY TIGHT AND RIGHTY MONARCH HAVE BEEN OBEYED SAID THE LEADER
SOME OF THEM SOON GOT AHEAD OF THE OLD SAILORMAN AND CAME TO THE ROPE LADDER WHICH TROT HAD LEFT DANGLING FROM THE STONE BENCH WHERE IT HUNG DOWN INSIDE THE CITY
THEN THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS CLEARED OF ITS AWFUL FURNITURE
YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME THEN BOUT AS FAR AS I CAN GET IN THIS COUNTRY THE BOY REPLIED GAZING OUT OVER THE WATER
THIS IS JUS THE BEST LUCK THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO US SHE EXCLAIMED CAUSE NOW WE CAN GO HOME WHENEVER WE PLEASE LET'S GO NOW--THIS MINUTE--BEFORE WE LOSE THE UMBRELLA AGAIN SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
CAP'N BILL WASN'T A VERY HANDSOME MAN
ARE YOU CONDEMNED TO BE PATCHED TOO LITTLE ONE NO ANSWERED TROT
IT WAS RATHER MOIST IN THE FOG BANK
DEAR ME SAID THE BEWILDERED SAILOR
ALL ABOARD
THE QUEEN OF THE PINKIES
WHAT DO THEY EAT THEN MEAT MILK CLOVER SEEDS BREAD CARROTS ALL RIGHT SAID TROT
I'M AGREE'BLE DECIDED CAP'N BILL
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE THREE--ROSALIE TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT--STOLE OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND CREPT UNOBSERVED INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WALL
THE BOOLOOROO'S GOT THE UMBREL AN THAT SETTLES THE QUESTION TELL ME SAID ROSALIE
LET'S FLY CRIED THE PARROT TURNING HIS HEAD SO THAT ONE BRIGHT LITTLE EYE LOOKED DIRECTLY INTO THE GIRL'S EYE
DO YOU LIKE GIRLS ASKED TROT MAKING ROOM FOR HIM
IF YOU WILL MAKE GHIP-GHISIZZLE MARRY ME I'LL FIND YOUR OLD UMBRELLA WHERE IS IT ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT EAGERLY
ROSALIE THOUGHT IT OVER FOR SOME TIME AND THEN REPLIED
NO NO YELLED TURQUOISE
SO TROT REMEMBERING THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT WOULD BE WITH THEM AND HAD PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A HEARTY EATER LOADED THE BASKET WITH ALL THE GOOD THINGS SHE COULD FIND
THE BLUESKIN SAT DOWN ON THE END OF THEIR BENCH NEXT TO BUTTON-BRIGHT AND BEGAN TO EAT HIS APPLE
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THE BOOLOOROO IS ABLE TO FOOL YOU ALL
WE ARE REALLY MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU ARE FOR THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR BRAIN WAS ALWAYS THE KEENEST BEFORE WE WERE PATCHED THAT MAY BE ADMITTED FREDJIM BUT WE ARE MUCH THE STRONGEST BECAUSE OUR RIGHT ARM WAS BY FAR THE BEST BEFORE WE WERE PATCHED WE ARE NOT SURE OF THAT RESPONDED JIMFRED FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT ARM TOO AND IT IS PRETTY STRONG WE WILL TEST IT SUGGESTED THE OTHER BY ALL PULLING UPON ONE END OF THIS BENCH WITH OUR RIGHT ARMS
THAT'S VERY BIG ISN'T IT NOT VERY REPLIED CAP'N BILL WITH A SMILE
THEY WERE HUNGRY FROM THE LONG RIDE AND WHILE THEY ATE THEY KEPT THEIR EYES BUSILY EMPLOYED IN EXAMINING ALL THE QUEER THINGS AROUND THEM
IN IT WAS A PINK POWDER WHICH SHE SCATTERED UPON THE SEAT OF A BIG ARMCHAIR
WHEN DO WE MARCH RIGHT AWAY SHE REPLIED
ARE THEY GOOD TO EAT ASKED THE BOOLOOROO
ILLUSTRATION CORALIE BELONGED TO THE SUNSET TRIBE AS SHE LIVED WEST OF THE QUEEN'S PALACE WHICH WAS THE CENTER OF THE PINK COUNTRY
BUT YOU NEEDN'T BE FRAID OF BEIN PATCHED WITH TIGGLE CAUSE I'VE SET HIM LOOSE
THE HANDLE THOUGH WAS REALLY CURIOUS
CAP'N BILL FINISHED THE STORY BY TELLING OF THEIR ESCAPE THROUGH THE FOG BANK
IT'S ALWAYS BEST TO REFORM WHEN IT IS NO LONGER SAFE TO REMAIN WICKED
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SUPPER WAS ON THE TABLE AND IN SPITE OF ALL THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER HE HAD EATEN BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD A FINE APPETITE FOR THE GOOD THINGS TROT'S MOTHER HAD COOKED
WHEN THE FINAL MINUTE IS UP WE DIE
IF YOU HAD A MAGIC UMBRELLA YOU MAY BE MAGICIANS AND SORCERERS COME HERE TO DECEIVE US AND PERHAPS BETRAY US TO OUR NATURAL ENEMIES THE BLUESKINS MUD AND BRICKS--FIDDLESTICKS
IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
BUT IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG TO GET THERE DECIDED BUTTON-BRIGHT AND IF YOU WERE CLOSE UP IT MIGHT NOT BE WORSE THAN ANY OTHER FOG
YOU BRUTES
WHICHEVER CAN PULL THE BENCH FROM THE OTHERS MUST BE THE STRONGER WHILE THEY WERE TUSSLING AT THE BENCH DRAGGING IT FIRST HERE AND THEN THERE IN THE TRIAL OF STRENGTH TROT OPENED THE DOOR OF THE PALACE AND WALKED IN
IT'S A MAGIC RING I'VE LOANED YOU MY DEAR SAID SHE AND AS LONG AS YOU WEAR IT YOU WILL BE INVISIBLE TO ALL EYES--THOSE OF BLUESKINS AND PINKIES ALIKE
THE ROCKS IS TOO THICK AN TOO SHARP CONTINUED CAP'N BILL PEERING DOWN TOWARD THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF ON WHICH THEY SAT AND AGAINST WHICH THE WAVES BROKE IN FOAM
IN THIS ORDER THEY PROCEEDED TO THE MAIN GATE WHICH TROT ORDERED THE GUARDS TO THROW WIDE OPEN
TELL ME SIR DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO IS MY FRIEND THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD
THEN SHE SLIPPED QUIETLY OUT OF THE ROOM AND FOUND IT WAS ALREADY LIGHT ENOUGH IN THE CORRIDORS FOR HER TO SEE ALL OBJECTS DISTINCTLY
BUT ALL OF THEM BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SLIPPED GOSSAMER RAINCOATS OVER THEIR CLOTHING WHICH KEPT THE RAIN FROM WETTING THEM
MUCH WORSE SAID TIGGLE WITH A GROAN
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE FOURTH BOUDOIR A HANDSOME BLUE PARROT SAT ON A BLUE PERCH AND BEGAN BARKING AS IF IT WERE NEARLY STARVED
THE MEAL WAS NO SOONER OVER THAN GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS SUMMONED TO THE CHAMBER OF HIS MAJESTY THE BOOLOOROO BUT BEFORE HE WENT AWAY HE TOOK TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON-BRIGHT INTO A SMALL ROOM AND ADVISED THEM TO STAY THERE UNTIL HE RETURNED SO THAT THE SERVANTS AND SOLDIERS WOULD NOT MOLEST THEM
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE A GOOD WITCH AND TO DO MY DUTY TROT THOUGHT THIS OVER QUITE SERIOUSLY FOR A TIME
AND YOU'VE ONLY ONE FOOT TO DROP CAP'N SHE SAID LAUGHING
AREN'T YOU SORRY FOR YOURSELVES I'M SORRY FOR YOU REPLIED TROT CAUSE YOU DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THE PROPER WAY TO TREAT VISITORS
THE PINKIES WERE STARTLED AND SEEMED A LITTLE FRIGHTENED AT HEARING A BIRD SPEAK SO CLEARLY
THEY'RE AWFUL GOOD THE BOOLOOROO ADVANCED A STEP AND TOOK THE APPLE WHICH HE REGARDED WITH MUCH CURIOSITY
HE IS AFRAID TO LET ANYONE SEE THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WOULD PROVE HE HAS ALREADY REIGNED THREE HUNDRED YEARS NEXT THURSDAY AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE TO RESIGN THE THRONE TO ME AND LEAVE THE PALACE AND LIVE IN A COMMON HOUSE MY MAGIC UMBRELLA IS IN THAT TREASURE CHAMBER SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT AND I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET IT ARE YOU INQUIRED GHIP-GHISIZZLE EAGERLY
HE KNEW AT A GLANCE IT WAS THE TERRIBLE BLUE WOLF AND THE SIGHT OF THE BEAST SENT A SHIVER THROUGH HIM
YOU'RE A NECTAR MIXER SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE CORRECTING THE SAILOR
HE OPENED IT AND CLOSED IT AND TURNED IT THIS WAY AND THAT COMMANDING IT TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS
AND THEY ALL HALTED TO FIND A MONSTROUS FROG OBSTRUCTING THEIR PATH
WHAT IS YOUR NAME PLEASE I'M NOW NAMED JIMFRED JONESJINKS AND MY PARTNER IS CALLED FREDJIM JINKSJONES
LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE EVERYWHERE IN THE STREETS AND THE BLUE CITY HUMMED LIKE A BEEHIVE FILLED WITH ANGRY BEES
WON'T IT BE FUNNY TO SEE THE OLD MOONFACE'S HEAD ON THE LITTLE GIRL
LET'S TAKE A DAY OFF AND HAVE A PICNIC
BUT I WON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE TILL WE'VE HEARD YOUR STORY
I ALLUS HAD A LIKIN FOR KINGS BEIN AS THEY'RE SUMMAT UNUSUAL
ILLUSTRATION CAP'N BILL AT ONCE FORMED HIS ARMY INTO LINE OF BATTLE AND HAD THEM ALL REMOVE THE CUMBERSOME RAINCOATS WHICH THEY PILED IN A HEAP AT THE EDGE OF THE FOG BANK
THAT'S QUEER
IT IS OLD SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
CUT EM THICK DEAR AN USE PLENTY OF BUTTER SUGAR ON EM ASKED TROT TURNING TO OBEY
ONE HE TIED AROUND TROT'S WAIST AND THEN ATTACHED TO IT SIX OTHER RIBBONS
WE CAN'T SAY TILL WE GET THERE MATE ANSWERED THE SAILOR IN A CHEERFUL VOICE
SEEMS TO ME WE'RE GOIN DOWN CALLED TROT
I'VE DONE IT MANY A TIME ON SHIPBOARD BUT YOU HADN'T A WOODEN LEG THEN SHE REMINDED HIM
NOW THEY TURNED IN NO LESS SURPRISE TO EXAMINE THE BOY AND THEIR LOOKS EXPRESSED NOT ONLY ASTONISHMENT BUT DISLIKE
DO YOU UNDERSTAND YES SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
CAP'N BILL'S A LUCKY FELLAH CAUSE HE FOUND THE OLD UMBRELLA TROT'S FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES
HAD THE JOURNEY BEEN MUCH FARTHER THE FUGITIVES WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERTAKEN BUT WHEN THE LEADERS OF THE PURSUING BLUESKINS WERE ONLY A FEW YARDS BEHIND THEM THEY REACHED THE EDGE OF THE FOG BANK AND WITHOUT HESITATION PLUNGED INTO ITS THICK MIST WHICH INSTANTLY HID THEM FROM VIEW
THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED TO HEAR THE BIRD TALK--AND IN POETRY TOO--BUT CAP'N BILL TOLD TROT THAT SOME PARROTS HE HAD KNOWN HAD POSSESSED A PRETTY FAIR GIFT OF LANGUAGE AND HE ADDED THAT THIS BLUE ONE SEEMED AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT BIRD
THE BOY'S DRESS WAS RICH AND EXPENSIVE EVEN TO HIS FINE SILK STOCKINGS AND TAN SHOES
THIS FAMOUS WOMAN WAS MUCH LIKE THE OTHER PINKIES IN APPEARANCE EXCEPT THAT SHE WAS SOMEWHAT TALLER AND NOT QUITE SO FAT AS MOST OF THE PEOPLE
OF COURSE IT'S SKY ISLAND
IT RAINED IN PHILADELPHIA FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS AND ALL THE UMBRELLAS IN OUR HOUSE WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE FAMILY AND LOST OR MISLAID OR SOMETHING SO THAT WHEN I WANTED TO GO TO UNCLE BOB'S HOUSE WHICH IS AT GERMANTOWN THERE WASN'T AN UMBRELLA TO BE FOUND
NONSENSE
IT WAS NOT IN THEIR WAY SO THEY HURRIED ON AND REJOINED THE FROG WHICH SAID TO THEM
HIS MAJESTY COMMANDS YOU TO GO AT ONCE TO THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE APARTMENTS OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES AND TO GUARD THE ENTRANCE UNTIL MORNING
WE'RE THROUGH THE WETFUL FOGS WHERE THE ELEPHANT SCARED THE FRETFUL FROGS THERE WAS A MAGNIFICENT SUNSET IN THE SKY JUST THEN AND IT CHEERED THE PINKIES AND GAVE THEM RENEWED STRENGTH
HAVEN'T YOU ANY FATHER YES NDEED
BUT YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T LET US
UNCLE BOB LOOKED SHARP AT THE THING AN SAID
BUTTON-BRIGHT ALSO NOTICED THAT HE LIMPED AS HE WALKED BECAUSE ONE LEG WAS A TRIFLE LONGER THAN THE OTHER AND THAT ONE HAND WAS DELICATE AND SLENDER AND THE OTHER THICK AND HARDENED BY USE
CAP'N BILL WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED AT BEING RECAPTURED AND SO WAS TROT WHO HAD EAGERLY FOLLOWED HIS EVERY MOVEMENT FROM HER WINDOW IN THE PALACE
SOAK US AGAIN DROWN US WITH RAIN IT MUTTERED IN A RESIGNED TONE
WELL WE'VE FIXED THE BLUE COUNTRY PRETTY WELL BY MAKIN SIZZLE THE BOOLOOROO OF IT
HE PLACED THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND THE BOLT TURNED WITH A SHARP CLICK
HE'S SAILED TO MOST EV'RY COUNTRY ON THE EARTH AN FOUND OUT ALL THAT THE PEOPLE IN EM KNEW AND A LOT BESIDES
BUT SHE FELT THAT HER OLD FRIEND WAS WISE IN ADVISING THEM TO GET AWAY QUICKLY
THERE WERE SIX OF THEM ALL GORGEOUSLY DRESSED IN SILKEN GOWNS WITH MANY PUFFS AND TUCKS AND RUFFLES AND FLOUNCES AND LACES AND RIBBONS EVERYTHING BEING IN SOME SHADE OF BLUE GRADING FROM LIGHT BLUE TO DEEP BLUE
WE'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S A VERY PRETTY ISLAND AND A FEW PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND KEEP COWS AND GOATS AND FISH FOR A LIVING
SO I GUESS SHE'LL BE GLAD TO GET RID OF US WHERE'LL WE GO HE ASKED SHIFTING ON HIS WOODEN LEG UNEASILY
CAP'N BILL SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID HE WAS AFEARED THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE
I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S HAD A BITE TO EAT SINCE HE STARTED
NOW THEN SAID THE BOOLOOROO I WILL INSTRUCT YOU TWO IN YOUR FUTURE DUTIES
BUT THE LITTLE GIRL HAD NOT YET APPEARED AND THE SAILORMAN AND THE BOY WERE BEGINNING TO BE UNEASY ABOUT HER
I'M TOLD EVERYTHING THERE IS PINK INSTEAD OF BLUE
SO I SAID TO THE UMBRELLA
BUT WE WILL FOOL HIM
AS THEY PROCEEDED THEY PASSED MANY ROOMS WITH CLOSED DOORS AND BEFORE ONE OF THESE A PATCHED BLUESKIN WAS PACING UP AND DOWN IN A TIRED AND SLEEPY WAY
THE GIRL WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE QUEER DOGGIE AND SHE FOUND SOME MEAT IN A CUPBOARD AND FED HIM OUT OF HER HAND PATTING THE TINY CREATURE AND STROKING HIS SOFT BLUE HAIR
CAP'N BILL HALTED LONG ENOUGH TO GRAB THE MAN AROUND HIS LONG NECK WITH ONE HAND AND AROUND HIS LONG LEG WITH THE OTHER HAND
HA HA
AND SEE HERE CAP'N
SO DID WE CRIED THE SOLDIERS EAGERLY
AND WE'VE ONE GOOD FRIEND AMONG THE BLUESKINS SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
IT SHALL BE AS YOU DESIRE THEN HE TURNED TO TROT AND ADDED
WHY NOT REPLIED THE SAILORMAN
WHEN THEY CAME TO THIS TREE TROT WAS STILL TRYING TO THINK OF THE MOST PLEASANT PLACE TO PICNIC
ANYHOW IT'S A MAGIC STORY AND THE FUNNY PART OF IT IS IT'S TRUE
AM I TO BE PATCHED OR WHAT YOU WON'T BE HURT ANSWERED THE GIRL BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER PLACE TO STAY BESIDES THIS PALACE AN PERHAPS YOU'LL ENJOY WORKIN FOR A LIVIN BY WAY OF VARIETY CAN'T I TAKE ANY OF THE TREASURE WITH ME HE PLEADED
WHEN THEY'RE BIG THERE'S MORE OF EM
BUT THE PEOPLE CALLED UPON HIM FOR A SPEECH SO HE FACED THE BLUESKINS AND SAID
OH SHE SAID SUDDENLY CLAPPING HER HANDS TOGETHER
BUT THEY HAD BEEN KNOWN CORALIE SAID TO FIGHT ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY WITH THE SHARP STICKS AT WHICH TIMES A GOOD MANY WERE SURE TO GET HURT
THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
THE SHOUTING AND EXCITEMENT IN THE CITY FOLLOWING UPON THE RECAPTURE OF CAP'N BILL AROUSED THE SLEEPING BOOLOOROO
WHAT'S GOING TO BECOME OF ME THEN HE ASKED
GHIP-GHISIZZLE SEEMED ASTONISHED
DO IT QUICK THEN URGED TROT FOR I CAN'T STAND THOSE SNUBNOSES MUCH LONGER I'LL DO IT TO-NIGHT SAID THE BOY
THEY'RE CRUEL ENOUGH TO DO THAT--'SPECIALLY THE BOOLOOROO--BUT I GUESS THEY'VE NEVER THOUGHT O THROWIN FOLKS OVER THE EDGE
HE MUST A DROPPED FROM THE SKY CAP'N BILL SHE EXCLAIMED
AN WE'RE TRYIN TO SCAPE FROM THE BLUESKINS AN GET INTO THE PINK COUNTRY I DON'T BLAME YOU SAID THE FROG IN A FRIENDLY TONE
THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE FOG BANK AND THE CITY WAS LIKE A VAST GARDEN VERY CAREFULLY KEPT AND AS NEAT AS WAX
A MOMENT LATER THEY HAD UNFASTENED THE GATE AND FLED INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY WHERE THEY HEADED TOWARD THE LOW MOUNTAIN WHOSE OUTLINES WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT
CATCH A RIDE WI SOME ONE BUTTON-BRIGHT SHOOK HIS HEAD
CORALIE STOOD ON A CHAIR AND MADE A BOW AFTER WHICH SHE THANKED TROT IN THE NAME OF THE PINKIES FOR LEADING THEM SAFELY INTO THE BLUE COUNTRY AND OUT AGAIN AND FOR GIVING THEM SO GOOD A QUEEN AS ROSALIE
FATHER WAS AWAY AT THE OFFICE SO I FOUND IT IN THE ATTIC AN I JUS TOOK IT THEN UNCLE BOB SHOOK HIS HEAD AN SAID I OUGHT TO LEAVE IT ALONE
ON THE THIRD DAY JUST AT SUNRISE THE ARMY MOVED FORWARD TO THE FOG BANK HEADED BY CAP'N BILL CLAD IN AN EMBROIDERED PINK COAT WITH WIDE FLOWING PINK TROUSERS AND ACCOMPANIED BY TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH--ALL BUNDLED UP IN THEIR PINK RAINCOATS
IN THE MORNING I TRIED TO GET THE UMBRELLA TO GIVE ME A MAGIC BREAKFAST BUT IT WON'T DO ANYTHING BUT FLY
YOU'LL BE A BOOTBLUE OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
WHAT WE'D LIKE SAID TROT IS TO STAY HERE COSY AN PEACEABLE TILL WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET HOME TO THE EARTH AGAIN
GOOD-BYE POLYCHROME HEARD AND NODDED TO THEM SMILINGLY NEVER HALTING IN HER GRACEFUL DANCE
GOOD-BYE POLLY CRIED BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT AND CAP'N BILL BOTH CALLED OUT
FOR IF WE STAY HERE VERY LONG THE BLUESKINS MAY RISE AGAINST US AND CAUSE THE PINKIES MUCH TROUBLE JUS AS SOON AS WE FIND THAT UMBREL PROMISED TROT WE'LL DIVE INTO THE FOG BANK AN MAKE TRACKS FOR THE LAND OF SUNRISE AN SUNSET ILLUSTRATION THE FATE OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA CHAPTER 27
EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY
HOLD FAST SAID THE SAILORMAN AND THEY ALL HELD FAST TO THE ROPES WHILE THE BOY GLANCING UP TOWARD THE OPEN UMBRELLA HE HELD SAID SOLEMNLY AND DISTINCTLY
I MERELY RAN BACK TO THE CITY TO GET A DRINK OF WATER FOR I WAS THIRSTY DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO
WELCOME FRIENDS SHOUTED CAP'N BILL IN A LOUD VOICE
THE MEN WORE PICTURESQUE PINK CLOTHING AND ROUND HATS WITH PINK FEATHERS IN THEM BUT THE APPAREL OF THE WOMEN WAS STILL MORE GORGEOUS AND STRIKING
DON'T WAKE HER UP OR THE VISION WILL STOP MUTTERED THE PARROT
TROT WHO WAS MUCH ANNOYED AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED DID NOT HESITATE TO SEAT HERSELF ALSO IN A BIG EASY CHAIR
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF CAP'N BILL AND TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT YOU WATCH EM FROM THE RAINBOW AND I'LL WATCH DAY AND NIGHT AND WE'LL CALL A SKY POLICEMAN IF TROUBLE COMES IN SIGHT SUDDENLY THE BOW LIFTED AND CARRIED THE DANCING MAIDENS INTO THE SKY
BUTTON-BRIGHT NODDED VERY SERIOUSLY
WE FLEW TO THIS ISLAND ANYHOW PERHAPS SAID ANOTHER IF WE PUSHED THEM OFF THE EDGE THEY COULD FLY DOWN AGAIN
GUESS HE'S AFRAID HE'LL LOSE IT BUT IT AIN'T ANY GREAT SHAKES TO MY NOTION
BUT IT IS OUR COUNTRY--NOT YOURS--AND WE HAVE NO PLACE HERE FOR STRANGERS
WHERE SHALL WE GO LET'S GO AS FAR AS SMUGGLER'S COVE AN THEN TURN ROUND AN COME BACK
MY KEY--MY KEY
YOUR COUNTRY IS MUCH NICER THAN THE BLUE COUNTRY AND WE LIKE YOU PRETTY WELL FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN OF YOU
THE OUTSIDE GUARD IS JIMFRED JINKSJONES THE DOUBLE PATCH OF THE FREDJIM WHOM YOU HAVE MET AND THE INSIDE GUARD IS A RAVENOUS CREATURE KNOWN AS THE BLUE WOLF WHICH HAS TEETH A FOOT LONG AND AS SHARP AS NEEDLES OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEN ONE OF THE WOMEN CAME FORWARD AND ADDRESSED THE STRANGERS
DUSK HAD FALLEN AND THE MOON WAS JUST RISING
SAID THE PARROT
WHO'S THIS YOU'VE GOT TROT IT'S A BOY I'VE JUST FOUND EXPLAINED THE GIRL
THEREFORE WHEN CAP'N BILL'S ARMY REACHED THE WALL HE WAS OBLIGED TO HALT HIS RANKS UNTIL HE COULD FIND A WAY TO ENTER THE CITY
IT READ AS FOLLOWS
BUT HERE I AM AND HERE I'LL STAY
MY NAME IS CANCER--BUT I'M NOT A DISEASE
BUT BUTTON-BRIGHT COULD FIND NO COMFORT IN THEIR SITUATION AND HIS FACE WAS VERY SAD AS HE MARCHED ALONG BY TROT'S SIDE
AND LET THE BOOLOOROO CAPTURE US AGAIN DEMANDED BUTTON-BRIGHT WITH A SHIVER
I'D LIKE TO TRY IT TROT IF YOU DECIDE ON THIS ADVENTURE SAID ROSALIE I BELIEVE I CAN BE OF MUCH ASSISTANCE TO YOU THAT'LL HELP ASSERTED CAP'N BILL
THE FOG BANK IS SO THICK AND HEAVY THAT IT BLINDS ONE AND IF ONCE YOU GOT INTO THE BANK YOU MIGHT WANDER FOREVER AND NOT FIND YOUR WAY OUT AGAIN
THE BLUESKINS HESITATED UNTIL A FEW GOT PRICKED AND BEGAN TO YELL WITH TERROR WHEN THE WHOLE OF THE BOOLOOROO'S ATTACKING PARTY TURNED AND RAN BACK TO THE GATE THEIR RULER REACHING IT FIRST OF ALL
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE GIRL HAD SEEN THEM TOGETHER AND SHE MARVELED AT THE QUEER PATCHING THAT HAD SO STRONGLY UNITED THEM YET SO THOROUGHLY SEPARATED THEM
I NEED A LOT OF THINGS I'M SURE AND P'RAPS ADVICE IS ONE OF EM ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE MAGIC UMBRELLA CHAPTER 2
BUT NOTHING'S GOIN TO HAPPEN CAP'N
I HAVEN'T ANY IDEA WHAT BECAME OF IT THE SIX FORMER PRINCESSES WERE SITTING UPON A RUDE BENCH LOOKING QUITE BEDRAGGLED AND UNTIDY
BEG PARDON YOUR SMALL-SIZED MAJESTY SAID HE TO TROT BUT IT IS MY DUTY TO REPORT THAT THE PINKIES ARE PREPARING TO ATTACK THE CITY OH
I WILL FOLLOW THEIR ADVENTURES IN A VISION TO DISCOVER IF THEY HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH
WE'LL SEE RETURNED THE KING IMPATIENTLY
AND THAT'S IT THAT'S IT CRIED BOTH TROT AND CAP'N BILL
WHY NOT ASKED TOURMALINE
PHINIS THE INTERIOR SEEMED DARK AND TERRIBLE AS THEY STOPPED TO REGARD IT AS A POSSIBLE PLACE OF REFUGE
WHY IT'S POLYCHROME EXCLAIMED BUTTON-BRIGHT IN A VOICE OF MINGLED WONDER AND DELIGHT
DON'T MENTION IT REPLIED THE CRAB IN A TIRED TONE
YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO OBEY THE BOOLOOROO'S COMMANDS SO HE WON'T BECOME ANGRY AND HAVE YOU PATCHED HOW COULD HE PATCH US ASKED THE SAILORMAN CURIOUSLY
BUT THE UMBRELLA LOOKED OLD AND DISREPUTABLE
A POLICEMAN SAID HE'D PUT ME IN JAIL IF HE CAUGHT ME BEGGING SO I GOT AWAY AND TOLD THE UMBRELLA TO TAKE ME TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN
THIS GIRL IS BY THE LAW OF THE GREAT BOOK THE RIGHTFUL QUEEN OF THE PINKIES AND AS LOYAL CITIZENS YOU ARE ALL OBLIGED TO OBEY HER COMMANDS
PERHAPS HE DON'T KNOW THERE'S BEEN A REVOLUTION AND A NEW BOOLOOROO RULES THE COUNTRY
TO THEM THE FOG BANK WAS THE MOST DREADFUL THING IN EXISTENCE AND NO BLUESKIN HAD EVER VENTURED WITHIN IT EVEN FOR A MOMENT
OH WHAT BLISS TO KISS A MISS HE SHOUTED AS TROT HELD OUT HER HAND TO BE KISSED BY HER SUBJECTS
THEY BOUNDED A LONG DISTANCE AT THIS JUMP--SOME FARTHER THAN OTHERS--AND AS SOON AS THEY LANDED THEY JUMPED AGAIN WITHOUT GIVING THEIR PASSENGERS A CHANCE TO GET THEIR BREATHS
WHEN THEY REACHED THE NEAT FRAME COTTAGE WHICH STOOD ON A HIGH BLUFF A LITTLE BACK FROM THE SEA AND WAS COVERED WITH PRETTY GREEN VINES A WOMAN CAME TO THE DOOR TO MEET THEM
IT WAS A LONG LONG TRIP AND I GOT AWFUL TIRED HOLDING ONTO THE HANDLE BUT JUST AS I THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO LET GO I BEGAN TO DROP DOWN SLOWLY AND THEN I FOUND MYSELF IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY
HOW OLD IS THE BOOLOOROO HE WAS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS ELECTED REPLIED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
DON'T YOU KNOW THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES WILL HAVE REVENGE
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION MAYRE QUEEN OF THE PINK COUNTRY CHAPTER 18
IF YOU PREVENT ME FROM OBEYING THE BOOLOOROO'S ORDERS RETURNED THE BOY QUIETLY HE WILL PROBABLY HAVE YOU PATCHED THIS THREAT FRIGHTENED THE LONG-NECKED GUARD WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT ORDERS THE BOOLOOROO HAD GIVEN HIS ROYAL BOOTBLUE
I AM NOT A FAIRY MY DEARS BUT MERELY A WITCH AND SO MY MAGIC POWERS ARE LIMITED
AS POLYCHROME THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER LIVES IN THE SKY IT IS NATURAL THAT TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT MEET HER DURING THEIR ADVENTURES THERE
IN THE LITTLE SLEEPING CHAMBER ADJOINING THIS ROOM YOU WILL FIND PLENTY OF GOWNS POOR ENOUGH FOR THE QUEEN TO WEAR
I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THE WONDERFUL THING THAT HAD HAPPENED CAUSE I THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME
THEN FREDJIM STALKED AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PALACE TO GUARD THE PRINCESSES AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER IN HIS HAND
I'VE TRIED IT
ROSALIE LAUGHED
THEN SHE UNFASTENED HER FRIEND'S BONDS AND LEANED OVER TO GIVE HIS LEATHERY FACE A SMACKING KISS
I S'POSE SAID TROT I'LL HAVE TO PUT ON ONE OF TOURMALINE'S COMMON PINK DRESSES YES REPLIED POLYCHROME YOU MUST FOLLOW THE CUSTOMS OF THE COUNTRY ABSURD THOUGH THEY MAY BE
CERULIA GAVE TROT A PUSH ONE WAY AND SAPPHIRE PUSHED HER THE OTHER WAY SO THE LITTLE GIRL WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH AND VERY ANGRY WHEN FINALLY HER PUNISHMENT CEASED
AN SEEIN AS WE'RE EARTH FOLKS AN NOT NATIVES OF SKY ISLAND I'VE AN IDEA THE SLICING MACHINE WOULD ABOUT END US WITHOUT BEIN PATCHED CONTINUED THE SAILOR
SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS CERULIA FETCH ME A MIRROR SLAVE CRIED PRINCESS TURQUOISE A LOCK OF MY HAIR IS LOOSENED
SO THEY WENT DOWN AND FOUND THAT A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE HAD GATHERED AND THESE CHEERED TROT WITH MUCH ENTHUSIASM--WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE SCOWLS AND SURLY LOOKS WITH WHICH THEY HAD FORMERLY GREETED THEIR STRANGE VISITORS FROM THE EARTH
UPON THE BOW DANCED THE DAINTY DAUGHTERS OF THE RAINBOW AND THE UMBRELLA PASSED NEAR ENOUGH TO IT FOR THE PASSENGERS TO OBSERVE POLYCHROME MERRILY LEADING HER SISTERS HER FLEECY ROBES WAVING PRETTILY IN THE GENTLE BREEZE
IF HE LEAPED DOWN INTO THE CITY HE WOULD BE SEIZED AT ONCE
NONE CAN DISPUTE THAT THEN I'VE THE RIGHT TO MAKE NEW LAWS HAVEN'T I I BELIEVE SO IN THAT CASE SAID THE GIRL I'M GOIN TO MAKE A LAW THAT THE QUEEN SHALL HAVE THE SAME FOOD AN THE SAME DRESSES AN THE SAME GOOD TIMES THAT HER PEOPLE HAVE
THE EYES OF THE BEAST WERE SMALL RED STONES AND IT HAD TWO TINY TUSKS OF IVORY
CAN'T WE LAND ANYWHERE ELSE NOT UNLESS YOU CARE TO TUMBLE OFF SAID THE BOY
I'M NO BOOTBLACK DECLARED THE BOY
DO YOU HAVE A GOVERNESS YES
MY SUCCESSOR HAS ALREADY BEEN ELECTED BUT HE CAN'T REIGN FOR A HUNDRED YEARS TO COME I THINK THREE HUNDRED YEARS IS PLENTY LONG ENOUGH SAID TROT
WHY THAT'S NO BARRIER EXCLAIMED CAP'N BILL
LET'S HAVE A HOLIDAY TO-DAY SHE SAID
SO SUDDENLY HE GAVE A MIGHTY LEAP AND CAME DOWN INTO THE FIELD OUTSIDE THE CITY
NOW SHE SAID
SO ON THE VERY MORNING THAT THE PINKIES ARRIVED THE BOOLOOROO HAD ORDERED HIS TWO PRISONERS BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM OF THE PALACE WHERE THE GREAT KNIFE STOOD AND HIS SOLDIERS WERE GETTING READY TO PERFORM THE OPERATION OF PATCHING GHIP-GHISIZZLE WITH TIGGLE WHEN A MESSENGER CAME RUNNING TO SAY THAT A GREAT ARMY OF THE PINKIES HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE FOG BANK
AFTER HESITATING A MOMENT WHICH WAY TO TURN SHE DECIDED TO VISIT THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES AND PASSED THROUGH THE BIG RECEPTION ROOM TO THE SLEEPING ROOM OF INDIGO
AND RIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST TROT CLAIMED BUTTON-BRIGHT'S PROMISE TO TAKE HER TO TOWN WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
THAT IS THE ONE DRAWBACK OF OUR COUNTRY
OUR MISTAKE HE ADDED WAS IN STOPPIN TO EAT OUR LUNCH
AND SHE SHALL LIVE IN A HOUSE JUS AS GOOD AS THE HOUSES OF ANY OF HER PEOPLE AN HAVE AS MUCH MONEY TO SPEND AS ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T SEE THAT HUMAN CRITTERS HAS ANY CALL TO FLY IN THE AIR ANYHOW
THERE WERE MANY HANDSOMELY CARVED BENCHES AND SEATS OF BLUE WOOD SCATTERED ABOUT THE GARDEN AND NEAR THEM STOOD A FOUNTAIN MADE OF BLUE MARBLE WHICH SHOT LOVELY SPRAYS OF BLUE WATER INTO THE BLUE AIR
YOU FEEL SO LIGHT AN FREE AN'--AN'--GLAD
WHILE HE POLISHED THE SHOES HE TOLD HIS PLANS TO CAP'N BILL AND TROT AND ASKED THEM TO BE READY TO FLY WITH HIM AS SOON AS HE RETURNED WITH THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
THE CAPTAIN HALTED HIS SOLDIERS PEERING CURIOUSLY OVER HIS SHOULDERS AND THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES LOOKING ON FROM BEHIND WHERE THEY CONSIDERED THEMSELVES SAFE
THE MAN WAS MUCH SURPRISED AT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT LISTENED CAREFULLY AND WHEN HE HEARD THE GIRL MAKE A NOISE AT ONE END OF THE CORRIDOR HE OPENED THE DOOR AND RAN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO
WE MUST SAVE HIM FROM THAT FATE GIRLS AND FORCE HIM TO DECIDE AMONG US
THE PINKIES ARE A BEASTLY CREW THE COUNTRY WAS NOT SO TRIM AND NEATLY KEPT NEAR THE EDGE FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THE PEOPLE DID NOT CARE TO GO TOO NEAR TO THE DANGEROUS PLACE
DEAR ME SAID TROT
AND YOU DON'T KNOW US VERY WELL REMARKED CAP'N BILL
WHAT'S YOUR NAME BUTTON-BRIGHT HOW DID IT HAPPEN HOW DID WHAT HAPPEN SUCH A FUNNY NAME THE BOY SCOWLED A LITTLE
ARE YOU A GIANT SHE ASKED THE SAILOR IN A SOFT SWEET VOICE
LOOK OUT CRIED THE PARROT SHARPLY
BEFORE THEY COULD REACH THE WALL THE BLUESKINS HAD CAPTURED TROT'S OLD FRIEND AND LUGGED HIM DOWN INTO THE CITY SO CORALIE AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WERE FORCED TO RETURN TO THEIR CAMP DISCOMFITED
WHILE THE BOOLOOROO STORMED AND RAGED A BAND OF SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS CAME MARCHING IN SURROUNDING CAP'N BILL WHO WAS AGAIN FIRMLY BOUND
GO AHEAD THEN AND EAT YOUR LUNCH HE RETREATED A LITTLE WAY TO A MARBLE SEAT BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN BUT WATCHED THE STRANGERS CAREFULLY
I AM INDEED RELIEVED TO HAVE YOU INTERPRET THE LAW IN THIS WAY DECLARED TOURMALINE
FIRST THERE WAS BUTTON-BRIGHT IN THE ATTIC OF HIS HOUSE FINDING THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
JUST TOURMALINE
I GUESS I'M A LITTLE PROUD OF IT
OH CAP'N BILL SHE EXCLAIMED LET'S GO TO THAT ISLAND FOR OUR PICNIC
HERE THE SCENE THAT CONFRONTED THEM WAS PRETTY AND HOMELIKE EXCEPT FOR THE PREVAILING COLOR AND THE FACT THAT ALL THE BUILDINGS WERE ROUND WITHOUT A SINGLE CORNER OR ANGLE
THE PINKIES HOWEVER ARE VERY DECENT NEIGHBORS OH I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT CRIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
SO WE RAN AWAY AND PASSED THROUGH THE FOG BANK AND CAME HERE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
THE PARROT WAS FLUTTERING ITS WINGS AND PRUNING ITS FEATHERS TO REMOVE THE WET OF THE FOG
I THINK YOU WILL SOON CHANGE YOUR MIND ADDED AZURE
THIS MORNING I FLEW FROM CHICAGO TO DENVER BUT NO ONE THERE WOULD GIVE ME ANY LUNCH
THE TREES WERE ALL BLUE THE GRASS WAS BLUE THE FLOWERS WERE BLUE AND EVEN THE PEBBLES IN THE PATHS WERE BLUE
THE POOR QUEEN BY THE WAY WAS SELDOM SEEN AS SHE PASSED ALL HER TIME PLAYING SOLITAIRE WITH A DECK THAT WAS ONE CARD SHORT HOPING THAT BEFORE SHE HAD LIVED HER ENTIRE SIX HUNDRED YEARS SHE WOULD WIN THE GAME
THROUGH THESE HOLES HE HAD RUN STOUT ROPES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SEAT COULD NOT TURN AND THE OCCUPANTS COULD HOLD ON TO THE ROPES ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM
YOU'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE I'VE TOLD THE SECRET TO HE ADDED GLANCING INTO THEIR FACES RATHER UNEASILY
TROT TURNED TO THE PINKIES
BUT BY THAT TIME IT HAD STOPPED RAINING FOR AWHILE ANYHOW AND UNCLE BOB TOLD ME TO GO STRAIGHT HOME AND PUT THE UMBRELLA IN THE ATTIC AN NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN
TELL ME SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE TO BUTTON-BRIGHT DID YOU NOT TAKE THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK FROM THE TREASURE CHAMBER OF THE BOOLOOROO I DID REPLIED THE BOY
WE'D CALL THIS A SMALL TOWN IN OUR COUNTRY OUR COUNTRY IS THOUSANDS OF MILES WIDE AND THOUSANDS OF MILES LONG--IT'S THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ADDED THE BOY EARNESTLY
I WONDER HOW FAR IT IS TO THE OTHER SIDE REMARKED TROT WEARILY
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T STOP IT WON'T LET YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND EH REPLIED CAP'N BILL
ONE OF THE SOLDIERS CAME FROM A HOUSE SLEEPILY YAWNING AND STRETCHING HIMSELF AND PRESENTLY HIS EYES LIT UPON THE HUGE FORM OF CAP'N BILL HASTENING ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL
CAN'T YOU HELP US POLLY WANTS A CRACKER!--POLLY WANTS A CRACKER SCREECHED THE PARROT
THEY ARE NOW QUITE SAFE AND CANNOT ESCAPE ME SO THE MEN UNWOUND THE LONG CORDS THAT WERE TWINED AROUND THE BODIES OF OUR THREE FRIENDS AND SET THEM FREE
LET'S RIDE ON THE FROG CAP'N RIGHT YOU ARE MATE HE REPLIED AND ALTHOUGH HE SHOOK A BIT WITH FEAR THE OLD MAN AT ONCE BEGAN TO CLIMB TO THE FROG'S BACK
THEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD STUMBLED OVER THE CLAW OF A GIGANTIC LAND-CRAB WHICH LAY SPRAWLED OUT UPON THE PEBBLY BOTTOM
AS I KNOW MY OWN COUNTRY MUCH BETTER THAN YOU OR THE PINKIES DO I THINK I CAN FIND A WAY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR PURPOSE ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES CHAPTER 24
INDIGO MADE A RUSH AND CAUGHT TROT BY BOTH SHOULDERS
THE SAILOR GLANCED AROUND HIM
IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE YOUR MAJESTY THIS BLUE ISLAND'LL HAVE TO GET ANOTHER BOOLOOROO WHY ASKED THE BLUESKIN
IT MUST GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE DREADFUL HEADACHES I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT BOOK OF RECORDS MUSED CAP'N BILL WHO DIDN'T THINK THE DISCRIPTION OF THE SUNSET COUNTRY AT ALL DREADFUL
THE BOOLOOROO AND HIS QUEEN AND DAUGHTERS--THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES--DINED IN FORMAL STATE IN THE BANQUET HALL WHERE THEY WERE WAITED UPON BY FAVORITE SOLDIERS OF THE ROYAL BODYGUARD
IF AT ANY TIME YOU WISH TO BE SEEN TAKE THE RING FROM YOUR FINGER
SO I CALLED OUT TO THE UMBRELLA
WHAT IN THE SKY IS THIS CROWD W--WE'RE--STRANGERS STAMMERED TROT
THEIR SKINS ARE NOT BLUE BUT NEITHER ARE THEY WHITE
THEY MET NO ONE ON THE STREETS AND CONTINUED THEIR FLIGHT UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE CITY WALL WHICH HAD A BLUE-IRON GATE IN IT
HOWEVER DID YOU GET HERE MATE IN THE BOOLOOROO'S OWN DEN
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM REPLIED THE FRIGHTENED BOOLOOROO
OUT FROM THE GATE THEY MARCHED VERY BOLDLY AND PRESSED ON TO ATTACK THE PINKIES WHO WERE DRAWN UP IN LINE OF BATTLE TO RECEIVE THEM WITH CAP'N BILL AT THEIR HEAD
IT APPEARED THAT CORALIE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE SUNSET TRIBE AND A MAN NAMED TINTINT THE CAPTAIN OF THE SUNRISE TRIBE
THE QUEEN CAN HAVE HER SHARE OF EVER'THING CORDIN TO THE NEW LAW BUT IF SHE TRIES TO GET MORE THAN HER SHARE I'LL HAVE THE LAW SAY SHE SHALL BE TAKEN TO THE EDGE AN PUSHED OFF
I DON'T B'LIEVE THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER OCEAN SAID HE
DO YOU LIKE BOYS WHEN THEY DON'T PUT ON AIRS OR GET ROUGH-HOUSE REPLIED TROT
THEN I WISHED FOR A NICKEL TO BUY AN ICE-CREAM SODA WITH
BUT WE MAY AS WELL START IN THE SAME DIRECTION BROOKS AND CREEKS HOW IT LEAKS MUTTERED THE PARROT
I'M NO ROYAL HIGHNESS HE SAID
I WISH YOU WAS THE BOOLOOROO NOW SIR
OH IT'S THE EARTH CHILD SAID HE
SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO CONTRADICT CAP'N BILL WHO KNEW EVER'THING SO DO I ADDED BUTTON-BRIGHT
BUT THE WORLD'S FULL O BOTH KINDS AND SO I TRY TO TAKE EM AS THEY COME
WHY WHERE HAS SHE GONE I'M RIGHT HERE SAID TROT'S VOICE BY HIS SIDE
THEN HE SAID
I KNEW THE UMBRELLA COULDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE PRESENTLY CAP'N BILL SPOKE AGAIN
IS THE PINK COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT SO WE ARE TOLD IN THE BOOK OF RECORDS REPLIED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
HURRAH SHOUTED BUTTON-BRIGHT GRABBING THE UMBRELLA AND HUGGING IT TIGHT IN HIS ARMS
SOME OF THE SOLDIERS LAUGHED TOO BEING TICKLED WITH THE ABSURD NOTION AND THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES ALL SAT UP STRAIGHT AND PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO SMILE CONTEMPTUOUSLY
IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION I HAVE SAID NO AN I MEAN IT ANSWERED THE GIRL
IT SURELY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANYTHING ELSE P'RAPS SUGGESTED TROT THE UMBRELLA CAN DO OTHER MAGIC THINGS NO SAID THE BOY
IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
WHAT ARE THOSE BUILDINGS OVER THERE POINTING TO THE RIGHT ALONG THE SHORE OF THE BAY
BUT HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO THESE STRANGERS WHY BEING IN THE PINK COUNTRY AS THEY SURELY ARE AND NOT BEING BLUESKINS THEY ARE BY THIS LAW ENTITLED TO PROTECTION TO A HOME AND GOOD LIVING
I'M GOING TO LET YOU WEAR THIS WONDERFUL RING FOR IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM BEING DISCOVERED BY YOUR ENEMIES
AS FOR CAP'N BILL HE WAS WATCHING THE SMILING FACE OF THE WITCH IN A PUZZLED BUT NOT HOPELESS WAY FOR HE THOUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM WHOLLY IN EARNEST IN WHAT SHE HAD SAID
WHEN THE COURTIERS AND THE PEOPLE ASSEMBLED SAW THE GOAT THEY GAVE A GREAT CHEER FOR THE BEAST HAD HELPED TO DETHRONE THEIR WICKED RULER
BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS GREATLY ASTONISHED TO SEE IN THIS VISION HOW THE BOOLOOROO HAD TESTED THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AND IN A FIT OF RAGE CAST IT INTO A CORNER UNDERNEATH THE CABINET WITH THE SEATS AND LUNCH BASKET STILL ATTACHED TO THE HANDLE BY MEANS OF THE ROPE
THE NEXT MINUTE HOWEVER HE HAD SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY ALONG THE GARDEN WALL
WHY WE WOULD IF WE COULD ANSWERED TROT
HERE GIVE ME THAT CLUMSY UMBRELLA NO PLEASE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT HOLDING THE UMBRELLA TIGHTER
WHERE IS THIS ARCH JUST OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE CITY
IT WAS JIMFRED JINKSJONES THE DOUBLE OF THE FREDJIM JONESJINKS THEY HAD TALKED WITH IN THE SERVANTS HALL AND HE BOWED LOW BEFORE THE MAJORDOMO
HE WAS A FAT AND POMPOUS LITTLE FELLOW AND LOVED TO STRUT UP AND DOWN HIS LINE OF WARRIORS TWIRLING HIS LONG POINTED STICK SO THAT ALL MIGHT ADMIRE HIM
IT'S ONLY TO CALL THE MERMAIDS TO ME IF I NEED THEM AND THEY CAN'T SWIM IN THE SKY YOU SEE ROSALIE SMILED AND KISSED HER AGAIN
IN THE HOUSES OF THE CITY HOWEVER THERE WAS MUCH FEASTING AND MERRYMAKING AND IT SEEMED TO TROT THAT THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY WHICH FORBADE THE QUEEN FROM ENJOYING ALL THE GOOD THINGS THE PEOPLE DID WERE DECIDEDLY WRONG AND NEEDED CHANGING
WE'RE IN THE SKY AND FLYIN HIGH
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RULE THE PINKIES I WOULDN'T LIKE IT REPLIED THE WITCH WITH A SMILE
I WAS SORRY BOUT THAT BUT I WENT UP IN THE ATTIC AND PRETTY SOON I FOUND IN A CORNER THIS OLD UMBRELLA
THE BOY LOOKED INTO THE SMALL RED EYES OF THE CARVED ELEPHANT'S-HEAD HANDLE WITH SOME MISGIVINGS BUT AS SEEN IN THE STRONG SUNSHINE THE EYES WERE MERELY RED STONES WHILE THE HANDLE PLAINLY SHOWED THE MARKS OF THE TOOL THAT HAD CARVED IT
IT WAS MAGIC I'M SURE SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
WHERE DO YOU S'POSE THE REAL SKY ISLAND CAN BE ASKED TROT PRESENTLY
CAP'N BILL THOUGHT IT WAS AS BIG AS A WHALE AND AS IT SQUATTED ON THE GRAY PEBBLES ITS EYES WERE ON A LEVEL WITH THOSE OF THE OLD SAILOR
IT WAS A SPLENDID ARRAY OF WARRIORS AND FROM WHERE THEY STOOD THEY COULD DISCOVER SEVERAL BLUESKINS RUSHING IN A PANIC TOWARD THE BLUE CITY AS FAST AS THEIR LONG BLUE LEGS COULD CARRY THEM
CAP'N BILL KEPT ON SMOKING AND SAID NOTHING
HUH EXCLAIMED THE BOOLOOROO
BUTTON-BRIGHT LIKED THE SAILOR'S LOOKS
I HAD TEN CENTS CAR FARE BUT I WAS AFRAID TO SPEND IT
MACK'REL AN HERRINGS ROARED CAP'N BILL NOW REALLY FRIGHTENED
YOU SHALL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR THIS REBELLION DON'T WORRY REPLIED TROT
GO SEEK YOUR HUSBANDS ELSEWHERE MONSTER CRIED INDIGO
THEIR DREADFUL COLOR MAKES ME HYSTERICAL HE SAID TO HIS SOLDIERS SO IF I AM TO HAVE ANY PEACE OF MIND WE MUST CHARGE THE FOE AND DRIVE THEM BACK INTO THE FOG BANK
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS GREATLY SURPRISED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF HER CAPTURE AND SO WAS BUTTON-BRIGHT
THEY ARE THE BLUE COUNTRY THE FOG COUNTRY AND THE PINK COUNTRY
I AM DOING THIS AS YOU SEE AND HOPE THAT MANY WILL WRITE TO ME AND TELL ME HOW THEY LIKE SKY ISLAND MY GREATEST TREASURES ARE THESE LETTERS FROM MY READERS AND I AM ALWAYS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THEM
THERE WAS A STRONG HIGH WALL OF PINK MARBLE AROUND IT AND THEY PASSED THROUGH A GATE MADE OF PINK METAL BARS AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL AND PICTURESQUE TOWN
WHEN SHALL WE START TROT HESITATED SO THEY ALL LOOKED TO ROSALIE FOR ADVICE
I REALLY HOPE THEY'LL COME OUT OF THE GREAT BLUE GROTTO ALIVE I ALSO HOPE THEY WILL REPLIED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
SO SHE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE CAMP FOLLOWED BY THE PINKIES AND ASKED ROSALIE WHAT COULD BE DONE
BUT IF YOU WILL THINK UPON IT CAREFULLY YOU WILL REALIZE THAT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HAS NO POWER IN ITSELF BUT IS ENCHANTED BY FAIRY POWERS SO THAT IT IS MADE TO FLY AND TO CARRY PASSENGERS THROUGH THE AIR BY FAIRIES
BUT THE PINKIES MUS BE LOOKED AFTER TOO CAUSE THEY'VE STOOD BY US AN HELPED US TO WIN
THE SAILOR PLACED THE BOARD UPON THE GROUND WHILE THEY SAT IN THEIR PLACES BUTTON-BRIGHT AT THE RIGHT OF TROT AND THEN THE BOY HOOKED THE ROPE LOOP TO THE HANDLE OF THE UMBRELLA WHICH HE SPREAD WIDE OPEN
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME SIZE WAS THE REPLY
WHY NOT RETURNED CAP'N BILL
BUT THE GIRL REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND LEAVING THE LAMB SHE STEPPED BACK INTO A CORNER AND HER FRENZIED ENEMIES FAILED TO FIND HER
THEN YOU SHINE THEM NEATLY AND YOUR TASK IS DONE
TROT HAD BEEN AS SURPRISED AS ANYONE AT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF CONDITIONS BUT SHE WAS QUICK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES IT AFFORDED
YOU'LL KNOW HOW TO BRING HER TO TIME I IMAGINE HE REMARKED AND IF THE GIRL ISN'T REASONABLE AND OBEDIENT SEND HER TO ME AND I'LL HAVE HER PATCHED
ALL THE OTHER LADIES OF THE COURT WILL BE WILD WITH ENVY AND IF THE CHILD DOESN'T PROVE OF USE TO US WE CAN KEEP HER FOR A LIVING PINCUSHION OH
HE SEEMED TO LIKE IT FOR HE FINISHED IT IN A HURRY AND WHEN IT WAS GONE HE PICKED UP THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
THEY TELL A QUEER STORY OF AN ESCAPE FROM THE BLUESKINS SO I DECIDED TO BRING THEM TO YOU THAT YOU MAY DETERMINE THEIR FATE THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
HOW DREADFUL THEY ALL CRIED IN A CHORUS
PILES OF GOLD AND JEWELS WERE ON ALL SIDES AND PRECIOUS ORNAMENTS AND SPLENDID CLOTHS RARE PIECES OF CARVED FURNITURE VASES BRIC-A-BRAC AND THE LIKE WERE STREWN ABOUT THE ROOM IN ASTONISHING PROFUSION
SHE HAD NOT BEEN MUCH HURT THOUGH AND SHE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PRINCESSES WERE ALL CRUEL AND VINDICTIVE SO THAT HER SAFEST PLAN WAS TO PRETEND TO OBEY THEM
TO PREVENT HIS RIVAL FROM EVER BECOMING THE RULER OF THE BLUE COUNTRY THE BOOLOOROO DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM PATCHED BUT FOR SOME TIME HE COULD FIND NO OTHER BLUESKIN TO PATCH HIM WITH
SHE'S KNITTIN CAP'N BILL A STOCKING DOESN'T HE WEAR BUT ONE THAT'S ALL
BUT THE BOY ANSWERED NOT A WORD
WHEN THE SOLDIERS RETURNED SHE TOLD THEIR LEADER TO PUT A STRONG GUARD BEFORE THE PALACE AND TO ADMIT NO ONE UNLESS EITHER SHE OR CAP'N BILL GAVE THE ORDER TO DO SO
OF COURSE THE BLUESKINS COULDN'T RUN AGAINST THESE SHARP POINTS SO THEY HALTED A FEW FEET AWAY AND BEGAN TO SWING THEIR CORD-AND-WEIGHTS
THEY DECIDED IT MUST BE A MAN BECAUSE HE HAD TWO LONG LEGS A BODY AS ROUND AS A BALL A NECK LIKE AN OSTRICH AND A COMICAL LITTLE HEAD SET ON THE TOP OF IT
ARE YOU READY ASKED THE FROG
I S'POSE HE KNOWS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN ALL THE WORLD WHEW SAID THE BOY
PERHAPS I DIDN'T SAY IT RIGHT HE REPLIED AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
THEN WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN THERE
IT'S A--A DISTANCE LIKE A MILE IS
OH
OH
THE LAW SAYS BOTHER THE LAW EXCLAIMED TROT
WITH MANY TO HUNT FOR IT AND THE LIBERTY OF THE WHOLE PALACE TO AID THEM EVERY INCH OF THE GREAT BUILDING WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINED
I'M THE BOOLOOROO SCUSE ME SAID TROT
MAGIC I GUESS THEN MAGIC MIGHT HOLD AN ISLAND IN THE SKY
WHY ASKED TOURMALINE CURIOUSLY
I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
I AM JUST ABOUT YOUR OWN AGE SIR--SIXTY-TWO MY NEXT BIRTH-DAY--BUT I'M SURE I DON'T LOOK AS OLD AS YOU THAT'S A FACT AGREED CAP'N BILL
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE OPEN SPACE INSIDE THE STATUES WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE PUBLIC MEETING PLACE OF THE PINKIES WAS A SMALL LOW HOUSE DOMED LIKE ALL THE OTHER HOUSES BUT BUILT OF A COARSE PINK STONE INSTEAD OF THE FINE MARBLE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE ELSE
OUR SCIENTISTS HAVE PROVED THAT THE EARTH IS NOT INHABITED YOUR SCIENTISTS'LL HAVE TO GUESS AGAIN THEN SAID TROT
TROT TOLD THE GIRLS THAT THEY MUST GO WITH THEIR FATHER TO LIVE IN GHIP-GHISIZZLE'S LITTLE OLD CABIN AND WHEN THEY HEARD THIS DREADFUL DECREE THE SIX SNUBNOSED ONES BEGAN TO SCREAM AND HAVE HYSTERICS AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO MAKE SO MUCH NOISE THAT NO ONE COULD HEAR ANYTHING ELSE
WHY CAN'T I THEY HAVEN'T LIVED SIX HUNDRED YEARS YET AND ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED THAT LENGTH OF TIME ARE ALLOWED TO MARCH THROUGH THE ARCH OF PHINIS INTO THE GREAT BLUE GROTTO THE KING LOOKED AT HIM WITH A SNEER
BUT THAT PLEASED THE BOOLOOROO ALL THE MORE
IN THE SKY HUNG A PINK GLOW WITH ROSY CLOUDS FLOATING HERE AND THERE AND THE SUN WAS NOT SILVERY WHITE AS WE SEE IT FROM THE EARTH BUT A DISTINCT PINK
THE BOOLOOROO WAS QUITE BUSY AT THE TIME THE PINKIES INVADED HIS COUNTRY
SLOWLY AT FIRST BUT QUICKLY GATHERING SPEED
BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE'S FRIENDLY PROTECTION MADE THEM HOLD ALOOF
TRUE--TRUE THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE THE LAW'S THE THING BECAUSE IT'S TRUE CRIED THE PARROT
A GUARD WAS PACING UP AND DOWN NEAR HER BUT AS HE COULD NOT SEE THE GIRL HE OF COURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER
PINKIES SAID SHE YOUR QUEEN HAS CONQUERED THE BOOLOOROO AND IS NOW THE QUEEN OF THE BLUES
THE TWO PARTS ARE SEPARATED BY AN IMPASSABLE BARRIER ANSWERED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
AND YOU'VE INTRUDED INTO THE PRIVATE GARDEN OF THE PALACE OF THE GREATLY STATELY IRATELY BOOLOOROO WHICH IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
YES OF COURSE
NO ONE HAD DISOBEYED A COMMAND OR DONE ANYTHING WRONG SO THE KING WAS IN A QUANDARY UNTIL HE DISCOVERED THAT A SERVANT NAMED TIGGLE HAD MIXED THE ROYAL NECTAR FOR CAP'N BILL WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO IT AT THE TIME OF HIS CAPTURE
I THINK WE WILL ALL BE GLAD WHEN HIS THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF RULE ARE ENDED WHEN WILL THAT BE INQUIRED THE BOY
THE PINKIES TURNED AWAY AND CONVERSED TOGETHER IN LOW TONES
BUT NO TRACE OF THE UMBRELLA COULD BE FOUND
CHILDREN TENDED THE GOATS--WEE BLUESKIN BOYS AND GIRLS WHOSE APPEARANCE WAS SO COMICAL THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT LAUGHED WHENEVER HE SAW ONE OF THEM
THEY ALL SAT IN SILENCE FOR A TIME AND WATCHED THE SILVER TRAIL THAT TOPPED THE CRESTS OF THE WAVES FAR OUT TO SEA
HOW ASKED THE BOOLOOROO
I'M NOT CRUEL HE SAID AND I DON'T APPROVE OF PATCHING IN GENERAL SO I'LL WILLINGLY DESTROY THE GREAT KNIFE
THAT'S IT SAID CAP'N BILL
S'POSE YOU JUS CALL YOURSELF THE BOSS
HALT CRIED TROT
SHE NEVER OBJECTED WHEN TROT WANTED TO GO AWAY WITH CAP'N BILL FOR A DAY'S PICNICKING
CAP'N BILL ROLLED AWAY IN HIS FRAME AND THE KNIFE FELL HARMLESSLY
NEVER MIND
NEVER MIND
THEY WENT INTO EVERY ROOM AND LOOKED BEHIND THE FURNITURE AND UNDERNEATH THE BEDS AND IN EVERY CRACK AND CORNER BUT NO PLACE COULD THEY SPY THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
BUT THE UMBRELLA KEPT UP ITS RAPID FLIGHT
BUT OUR FRIENDS WERE CONFRONTING AN IMPORTANT CRISIS IN THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURES AND WITH POSSIBLE DEATH AT THEIR JOURNEY'S END THEY WERE IN NO HURRY TO ARRIVE THERE
I THINK THEY IMAGINE YOU WILL BECOME FAVORITES OF THE BOOLOOROO AND OF THE PRINCESSES AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE JEALOUS AND HATE YOU THEY NEEDN'T WORRY BOUT THAT REPLIED TROT
BUT HOLD FAST THE ROPES CAP'N AN TAKE CARE OF YOUR WOODEN LEG BUTTON-BRIGHT ADDRESSED THE UMBRELLA SPEAKING TO IT VERY RESPECTFULLY FOR IT WAS A THING TO INSPIRE AWE
IF YOUR HALF WANTS TO DO SOMETHING THE OTHER HALF IS LIKELY TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THE FUNNY PART OF IT IS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW WHICH IS YOUR HALF AND WHICH IS THE OTHER HALF
HERE'S A PRETTY HOWDY-DO YOU HAVEN'T ANY BOOLOOROO TROT HAD LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THE MAJORDOMO'S SPEECH
THEY DO NOT HARMONIZE WITH OUR COLOR SCHEME REPLIED TOURMALINE
BUTTON-BRIGHT FLUSHED RED AS A PINKY AND THEN GREW VERY PALE
THE PETS REBELLED AT SUCH TREATMENT AND BELIEVING THEY OUGHT TO PROTECT TROT WHOM THEY KNEW TO BE THEIR FRIEND THEY PROCEEDED TO DEFEND HER
THAT YOU CHOOSE A WIFE FROM AMONG US AND PROMISE TO MARRY THE ONE SELECTED AS SOON AS THE PINKIES ARE DRIVEN BACK INTO THE FOG BANK GHIP-GHISIZZLE MANAGED TO SHAKE HIS HEAD
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I HATE IT'S A HURRY I'VE AN IDEA YOUR MAJESTY ANNOUNCED THE SIXTH SNUBNOSED PRINCESS WHOSE COMPLEXION WAS RATHER DARKER THAN THAT OF HER SISTERS AND IT HAS COME TO ME QUITE DELIBERATELY WITHOUT ANY HURRY AT ALL
TROT SEIZED THE LUNCH-BASKET AND RAN TO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE FOUND HER MOTHER BUSY IN THE KITCHEN
SAY GOOD-BYE AND LET'S FLY THROUGH THE SKY FAR AND HIGH IF WE ONLY HAD MY UMBRELLA WE'D FLY IN A MINUTE SIGHED BUTTON-BRIGHT
AS SOON AS THE SOLDIERS RETURN WITH TIGGLE SAID HE
IT WASN'T A VERY STRONG MOONLIGHT BUT IT ENABLED HER TO EXAMINE THE INTERIOR OF THE ROOM
HE NEXT PULLED AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS RIGHT EAR AND ANOTHER FAR-AWAY BELL TINKLED
OH LOOK CALLED CAP'N BILL
DON'T GET RECKLESS I WON'T CAP'N
NO YOUR MAJESTY
WHEN ALL WERE SEATED CLINGING TO ONE ANOTHER SO THEY WOULD NOT SLIDE OFF CAP'N BILL GAVE THE WORD OF COMMAND AND AWAY LEAPED THE FROGS ALL TOGETHER
I PRESENT YOU TO THE SIX LOVELY SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES TO BE THEIR SLAVE
THEY FELT THE FOG MELT AWAY AND FOUND THEMSELVES BATHED IN GLORIOUS RAYS OF SUNSHINE
SHE WAS TIRED TOO AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD FIND A VACANT ROOM--OF WHICH THERE WERE MANY IN THE BIG PALACE--AND GO TO SLEEP UNTIL DAYLIGHT
THEY HAD DECIDED TO CAPTURE THE BLUE CITY AT ALL HAZARDS THAT THEY MIGHT RESCUE TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND CONQUER THE BOOLOOROO SO WHEN FROM A DISTANCE THEY SAW THE BLUESKINS MARCH FROM THE GATE WITH BANNERS FLYING AND BANDS PLAYING THEY SUPPOSED A MOST TERRIBLE FIGHT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
AND HERE--KEEP MY POLLY TILL I COME BACK ADDED TROT GIVING HIM THE BIRD
THEN SEVERAL OF THE MEN RAN OUT TO SPREAD THE NEWS THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTRY SO THAT A VAST CROWD SOON BEGAN TO GATHER IN THE COURT OF THE STATUES
ONE THING'S CERTAIN FOLKS
HE DROPPED FROM THE SKY HE SAYS AN YET HE DID'NT COME IN A AIRSHIP
THE WITCH PAUSED A MOMENT
THIS UMBRELLA HAS BEEN IN OUR FAMILY YEARS AN YEARS AN YEARS
BUTTON-BRIGHT TURNED ALSO AND LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT THE OLD SAILOR WHO CAME STUMPING ALONG THE PATH TOWARD THEM
HE PLANNED TO RULE THE BLUE COUNTRY UNTIL THE LAST BUT I NOW KNOW THE DECEPTION HE HAS PRACTICED AND HAVE THE ROYAL RECORD BOOK TO PROVE IT
I'M THE BE QUIET SAID TROT STERNLY
THERE'S NOTHING THAT HURTS SO MUCH AS A COME-DOWN IN LIFE AN I SPECT THE OLD RASCAL'S GOIN TO BE PRETTY MISER'BLE BY'M'BY WHAT DOES HE SAY TO HIS REVERSE OF FORTUNE ASKED ROSALIE
FURTHER THAN IT LOOKS TO BE FROM HERE THAT WON'T MATTER REMARKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
TROT HASTENED TO THIS FORM AND KNELT BESIDE IT BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND IT WAS ONLY TIGGLE
HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE PLATFORM AND COMMANDED THE SOLDIERS TO RAISE THE GREAT KNIFE INTO POSITION
AND WHEN THE GUARD RUNS TO SEE WHAT IT IS YOU MUST RUN THE OTHER WAY
TAKE THAT UMBRELLA AND CARRY IT TO MY ROYAL TREASURY
HE LIVES AT MY HOUSE TOO--THE WHITE HOUSE YOU SEE OVER THERE ON THE BLUFF OH
NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
NO SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
IS YOUR BLUE COUNTRY VERY BIG ILLUSTRATION IT IS IMMENSE WAS THE PROUD REPLY
THIS LOOKS TO ME LIKE A GIVE-AWAY
MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE TO HAVE HIM HANGIN ROUND AN SCREECHIN BAD PO'TRY EV'RY MINUTE
BUT THEIR PRESENT POSITION WAS A VERY SERIOUS ONE AND EVEN CAP'N BILL DARED NOT ADVISE BUTTON-BRIGHT TO GIVE UP THE DESPERATE ATTEMPT
AND THEN ALL SIX HELD UP THEIR HANDS AS IF HORRIFIED
CHICAGO ILLUSTRATION COPYRIGHT 1912
AT ONCE BUTTON-BRIGHT EXCLAIMED
THAT'S THE SKY ISLAND WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOIN TO--ONLY WE DIDN'T YES
AT LAST I LANDED IN CHICAGO AND THEN I WAS IN A PRETTY FIX
THE BOOLOOROO HAVING MADE ALL PREPARATIONS TO RECEIVE THE ENEMY WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE THEY HELD BACK
HE HAD OFTEN WONDERED HOW THE MAGIC UMBRELLA COULD FLY AND OBEY SPOKEN COMMANDS BUT NOW HE PLAINLY SAW THAT THE THING MUST BE DIRECTED BY SOME INVISIBLE POWER AND THAT POWER WAS QUITE LIKELY TO SAVE THEM FROM THE CRUEL DEATH THAT HAD BEEN DECREED
WELL WELL TROT HE SAID COMING UP IS THIS THE WAY YOU HURRY TO TOWN NO FOR I'M ON MY WAY BACK SAID SHE
THE BOY HAD TAKEN OFF HIS OWN SHOES AFTER HE PASSED THE GUARD AND NOW HE TIPTOED CAREFULLY INTO THE ROOM SET DOWN THE ROYAL SHOES VERY GENTLY AND THEN CREPT TO THE CHAIR WHERE HIS MAJESTY'S CLOTHES WERE PILED
I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE BORDER
YOU WILL NOT BE HUMILIATED BY BECOMING A BOOTBLACK
IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM STOOD THE TERRIBLE KNIFE THAT GAVE THE PLACE ITS NAME--A NAME DREADED BY EVERY INHABITANT OF THE BLUE CITY
IT RAINED ALL THE WAY AND THE WALKING WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE
ILLUSTRATION THEY RODE QUITE COMFORTABLY HOWEVER AND WERE FULL OF EAGER INTEREST IN WHAT THEY SAW
THOSE WHO REMEMBER ARE USUALLY THE UNHAPPY ONES
NOTHING CAN KILL ME WHY NOT ASKED CAP'N BILL
WHAT A BLACK CLOUD IT GREW SUDDENLY DARK FOR THEY WERE RUSHING THROUGH A THICK CLOUD THAT ROLLED AROUND THEM IN BILLOWS
BLAME THE BOOLOOROO I--I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU SIR STAMMERED BUTTON-BRIGHT
A AIRSHIP EH CRIED CAP'N BILL IN SURPRISE
SO SHE TURNED THE KEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN
AND FINALLY A DARK RIM APPEARED BELOW THEM WHICH THE SAILOR DECLARED MUST BE THE EARTH
I SEE--I SEE SAID THE BOOLOOROO NODDING HIS FUNNY HEAD
TROT SLOWLY FOLLOWED THIS CORD AND IN THE DRESSING ROOM CAME UPON CAP'N BILL WHO WAS LYING ASLEEP UPON A LOUNGE AND SNORING WITH GREAT VIGOR
LONG LIVE QUEEN MAYRE CALLED OUT CAP'N BILL DANCING AROUND ON HIS WOODEN LEG IN GREAT DELIGHT
I'LL HAVE REVENGE!--I'LL--I'LL YOU'LL TAKE IT EASY CAUSE YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF SAID CAP'N BILL
AREN'T YOU RATHER SLOW ASKED THE FROG WHEN ONCE MORE THEY CAME UP TO HIM
I HOPE YOU BELIEVE ME
SHE REMEMBERED THERE WAS A COMFORTABLE VACANT ROOM JUST OPPOSITE THE SUITE OF THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES SO SHE STOLE SOFTLY UP TO IT AND TRIED THE DOOR
I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WILL DO WITH YOU FOR IN ALL OUR HISTORY WE HAVE NEVER BEFORE HAD STRANGERS INTRUDE UPON US WE'RE CURIOUS TOO SAID TROT
MARCH--APRIL--JUNE--OCTOBER SCREAMED THE PARROT
SOMETH'N LIKE FLYIN AUTYMOB'L'S AIN'T THEY I DON'T KNOW SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS THE MAJORDOMO AND MASTER OF CEREMONIES SO HE TOOK HIS SEAT AT THE END OF THE LONG TABLE AND PLACED CAP'N BILL ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND BUTTON-BRIGHT ON THE OTHER TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE OTHER BLUESKINS PRESENT WHO FAVORED THE STRANGERS WITH NOTHING PLEASANTER THAN ENVIOUS SCOWLS
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE PLAIN SIMPLE DRESS OF THE QUEEN AND THE GORGEOUS APPAREL OF HER COUNSELORS WAS QUITE REMARKABLE YET HER BEAUTY FAR SURPASSED THAT OF ANY OF HER PEOPLE AND HER DEMEANOR WAS SO MODEST AND UNASSUMING THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE PRISONERS TO BELIEVE THAT HER WORD COULD DECREE LIFE OR DEATH AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS WERE SUBSERVIENT TO HER
KER-CHUG KER-CHOO GRUNTED THE FROG
GIVE ME THAT CIRCLET FROM YOUR BROW TOURMALINE WITHOUT HESITATION TOURMALINE REMOVED THE ROSE-GOLD CIRCLET WITH ITS GLITTERING JEWEL AND HANDED IT TO POLYCHROME WHO TURNED AND PLACED IT UPON TROT'S BROW
IT WAS YOUR FAULT FOR GIVING ME THE WRONG NAME THEY GLIDED ALONG IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE
WE SEEM EVENLY DIVIDED ON THIS MATTER REMARKED THE QUEEN WITH A PUZZLED LOOK AT HER COUNCIL
AS THE QUEEN LIVED IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE CITY THE CAPTIVES WERE OBLIGED TO PARADE THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THIS STREET AND THAT GAVE ALL THE PINK CITIZENS A CHANCE TO HAVE A GOOD LOOK AT THE STRANGERS
YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH SAID CAP'N BILL

NO ONE COULD SEE HER SO NO ONE--NOT EVEN CAP'N BILL--KNEW SHE WAS THERE
THEIR INSTRUMENTS ARE MADE OF BLUE METAL WELL ORDER EM OUT COMMANDED TROT
COULD YOU CLIMB DOWN A ROPE LADDER CAP'N SHE ASKED
WHILE HE PUT ON HIS CLOTHES THE KING OCCASIONALLY GAVE THE CORD A SUDDEN PULL HOPING TO HURT CAP'N BILL'S BIG TOE AND MAKE HIM YELL
THIS SERVANT WAS NOT SO LONG-LEGGED AS GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND HIS HEAD WAS THICKER AND HIS NOSE FLATTER
TO THROW US OFF THE ISLAND WILL BE MURDER DECLARED THE SAILOR
I KNOW ALL THAT CAP'N
AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE FLYIN OVER THE LAND WE'D DROP THERE
IT WAS MERELY A SWING SEAT
THEY ARMED THEMSELVES WITH LONG CORDS HAVING WEIGHTS FASTENED TO THE ENDS AND PRACTICED THROWING THESE WEIGHTS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE CORDS WOULD WIND AROUND THEIR ENEMIES
THE DRAPERIES WERE SUPERBLY EMBROIDERED AND THE RUGS UPON THE MARBLE FLOORS WERE WOVEN WITH BEAUTIFUL SCENES IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE SHADE OF BLUE
HE FOUND THE CORD STILL TIED TO HIS BIG TOE AND AT FIRST IMAGINED HIS PRISONER WAS SAFE IN THE DRESSING ROOM
I WANT TO GO AS FAR AS SMUGGLER'S COVE AND THEN TURN AROUND IN THE AIR AND COME BACK HERE HE SAID
UP AGAIN I FLEW SWIFTER THAN A BIRD AND I SOON SAW THIS WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER LONG JOURNEY
NONE OF US NOW LIVING KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT THE BOOK OF RECORDS CALLS IT THE SUNSET COUNTRY AND SAYS THAT AT EVENING THE PINK SHADES ARE DROWNED BY TERRIBLE COLORS OF ORANGE AND CRIMSON AND GOLDEN-YELLOW AND RED
WHY THEY'RE OUR ENEMIES YOUR SHORT HIGHNESS NOT ANY MORE REPLIED TROT
IS THAT YOUR HOME YES SAID TROT PROUDLY
HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN WHAT
SEEMS FUNNY DON'T IT CAP'N BILL JUST THEN THEY HEARD A SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS IN THE CORRIDOR
BUT SINCE YOU TOURMALINE HAVE DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THIS TERRIBLE THING AT ONCE I SHALL GO WITH YOU AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN SOME OF THE PINKIES LOOKED PLEASED AND SOME TROUBLED AT THIS SPEECH BUT THEY ALL PREPARED TO ESCORT THE PRISONERS TO THE NEAREST EDGE OF THE ISLAND
ANYHOW YOU'LL GET BADLY DAMAGED IF YOU TRY TO INTERFERE WITH US--AN THAT'S A FACT DON'T KILL HIM CAP'N BILL SAID TROT CHEERFULLY
BUT WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT ASKED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
PERHAPS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT EVERY BLUESKIN IN SKY ISLAND LIVES EXACTLY SIX HUNDRED YEARS FROM THE TIME HE IS BORN NO
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT UMBRELLAS ARE REPLIED THE PINKY MAN
SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD THERE'S A REAL SKY ISLAND AND HAVING TOLD THE MAGIC UMBRELLA TO TAKE US THERE IT'S GOING TO DO SO WELL I DECLARE GASPED THE SAILORMAN
SIZZLE'S NEVER BEEN THERE AN HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT
WHY NOT YOUR HIGHNESS BECAUSE HERE IS ONE LIGHTER IN COLOR THAN YOURSELF POINTING TO TROT
PLEASE MAKE THE ROPE LADDER AT ONCE ROSALIE SO THE WITCH TOOK SOME ROPES AND KNOTTED TOGETHER A LADDER LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE TOP OF THE WALL
ILLUSTRATION THAT'S IT CRIED BUTTON-BRIGHT EXCITEDLY
SHE IS NOT LIKE OUR PEOPLE AND WOULD NOT HARMONIZE WITH THE UNIVERSAL COLOR HERE THAT'S TRUE SAID ANOTHER
BUT WHEN YOU MARRY A GIRL YOU MARRY THE INSIDE AS WELL AS THE OUTSIDE DECLARED GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND INSIDE THESE PRINCESSES THERE ARE WICKED HEARTS AND EVIL THOUGHTS
IT'S A GOOD MANY MILES AWAY TROT HE SAID
THEN WHEN HE HAD RETIRED TO HIS OWN PRIVATE ROOM HE DECIDED TO SEND FOR THE UMBRELLA HE HAD STOLEN FROM BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TEST ITS MAGIC POWERS
IT OUGHT TO BE FOR LIFE
EACH CORD HAD A WEIGHT AT THE END AND WHEN THE WEIGHT WAS SKILLFULLY THROWN BY A SOLDIER IT WOUND THE CORD AROUND ANYTHING IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND HELD FAST UNTIL IT WAS UNWOUND AGAIN
BUT WE HAVE TALKED LONG ENOUGH OF MYSELF
UNDER HIS ARM HE HELD AN OLD UMBRELLA THAT WAS AS TALL AS HE WAS
THE PINKIES WERE EVERY ONE SHORT AND FAT AND GORGEOUSLY DRESSED IN PINK ATTIRE AND THEIR FACES INDICATED THAT THEY WERE CONTENTED AND HAPPY
BY THIS TIME THE GOAT WAS SO ANIMATED BY THE SPIRIT OF CONQUEST THAT HE RUSHED AT THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WHO HAD ALL CLIMBED UPON THEIR CHAIRS AND WERE SCREAMING IN A PANIC OF FEAR
ANYWHERE SUITS ME REPLIED CAP'N BILL
THE SOONER THE BETTER MY LAD REMARKED THE SAILOR
TROT SEATED HERSELF ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND BUTTON-BRIGHT ON THE OTHER AND THE SAILOR PUT HIS ARMS AROUND THEM BOTH TO HOLD THEM TIGHT TOGETHER
HE HAD TAKEN A WIDE BOARD THAT WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR BOTH THE BOY AND GIRL TO SIT UPON AND HAD BORED SIX HOLES IN IT--TWO HOLES AT EACH END AND TWO IN THE MIDDLE
SO HE WENT AMONG HIS PEOPLE AND REMINDED THEM HOW HORRIBLE IT WOULD FEEL TO BE PUNCHED FULL OF HOLES BY THE INVADERS AND URGED THEM TO FIGHT DESPERATELY AND DRIVE THE PINKIES BACK INTO THE FOG BANK
BUT ROSALIE SAID TO THEM
I AM TOLD HOWEVER THAT ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE ISLAND--WHICH I HAVE NEVER SEEN--THE SUN SHINES BRIGHTLY BUT THERE IS NO MOON AT ALL OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
PARROTS CAN SAID TROT
I SHUT UP THE UMBRELLA AND SAW A GIRL SITTING ON THE ROCK SO I WENT UP AND SPOKE TO HER
GHIP MY DEAR WE WILL RELEASE YOU ON ONE CONDITION
BUT NO MORE
WHETHER THE UMBREL IS MAGIC OR NOT BUTT'N-BRIGHT IS WELCOME MRS GRIFFITH CAME OUT SOON AFTER AND SECONDED THE INVITATION SO THE BOY FELT QUITE AT HOME IN THE LITTLE COTTAGE
IT WAS HER BADGE OF OFFICE AND SEEMED VERY INCONGRUOUS WHEN COMPARED WITH HER POOR RAIMENT AND SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS
YOU ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR ME
WITH THE MAGIC UMBREL SAID CAP'N BILL POINTING TO THE UMBRELLA THAT BUTTON-BRIGHT WAS HOLDING UNDERNEATH HIS ARM
WE'VE CITIES ON THE EARTH TEN TIMES BIGGER--AN THEN SOME BIG BESIDES
UNTIL WE PROVE YOUR TRUTH AND HONOR WE MUST REGARD YOU AS ENEMIES OF OUR RACE
THIS WAS SUFFICIENT EXCUSE FOR THE BOOLOOROO WHO AT ONCE HAD TIGGLE MADE A PRISONER AND BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
I SHALL APPOINT YOU THE ROYAL NECTAR MIXER TO THE COURT OF SKY ISLAND AND IF YOU DON'T MIX OUR NECTAR PROPERLY I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED
THEN CAP'N BILL ADDRESSED THE ARMY AND TOLD WHAT THE FOG BANK WAS LIKE
THINKING IT TIME THE PRINCESS AWOKE TROT LEANED OVER AND GAVE HER SNUBNOSE A GOOD TWEAK AND AT ONCE INDIGO YELLED LIKE AN INDIAN AND SAT UP GLARING AROUND HER TO SEE WHO HAD DARED TO PULL HER NOSE
THE ALMANACS ALWAYS DID US FULL JUSTICE THE CRAB REPLIED BUT I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOT FASHIONABLE NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND WE'D LIKE TO PASS ON SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
IS IT AN ISLAND ASKED TROT ANXIOUSLY
THE SLICING AND PATCHING PROVES IT AND SO DO LOTS OF OTHER THINGS NOW THEN SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE LET US TALK OVER YOUR DUTIES
HIS NOSE WAS THIN ON ONE SIDE AND FLAT ON THE OTHER WHILE ONE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CURLED UP AND THE OTHER DOWN
THE OLD EARTH MAN IS TO BE PATCHED TO POOR TIGGLE INSTEAD OF GHIP-GHISIZZLE WHO HAS IN SOME WAY MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE--NO ONE KNOWS HOW BUT TIGGLE AND TIGGLE WON'T TELL WE'RE SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO HAS TO BE PATCHED REPLIED FREDJIM IN A REFLECTIVE TONE FOR ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T HURT US AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED IT'S A TERRIBLE MIX-UP TO BE IN--UNTIL WE BECOME USED TO OUR STRANGE COMBINATION
THE CORD DIDN'T WIND AROUND THE PINKIE AS HE WAS TOO FAR OFF BUT THE WEIGHT HIT HIM IN THE EYE AND MADE HIM HOWL LUSTILY AS HE TROTTED BACK TO HIS COMRADES AT FULL SPEED
I'VE A SUSPICION THAT ONCE THEY ENTER THE GREAT BLUE GROTTO THAT'S THE LAST OF THEM GHIP-GHISIZZLE WENT AWAY QUITE SAD AND UNHAPPY
I THINK I'LL MAKE SIZZLE THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES
GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS TO HAVE BEEN MY MATE BUT GHIP ESCAPED BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WHY SHE ASKED
I MUST MANAGE TO GET MY UMBRELLA SOMEHOW OR OTHER THEY NOW WALKED BACK TO THE PALACE STILL OBJECTS OF MUCH CURIOSITY TO THE NATIVES WHO SNEERED AT THEM AND MOCKED THEM BUT DARED NOT INTERFERE WITH THEIR PROGRESS
BUT FIRST YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME SAVE US BOTH AS HOW HE ASKED STEPPING FROM THE FRAME
FIRST IT LIFTED THE SEAT OF THE BOY AND GIRL THEN CAP'N BILL'S SEAT AND FINALLY THE LUNCH-BASKET
SIDES ALL THAT I'M THE QUEEN O SKY ISLAND--WHICH MEANS QUEEN O THE PINKIES AN QUEEN O THE BLUES--BOTH OF EM
A ROPE MIGHT BREAK YOU KNOW OH CAP'N BILL
THE ONLY OTHER THING WOULD BE SALAD AN I DON'T LIKE SALADS
IT'S PRETTY FAR BUT HERE WE ARE AND THEN HE BARKED LIKE A DOG AND CHUCKLED WITH GLEE AT HAVING FOUND HIS LITTLE FRIEND
THE NEW BOOLOOROO SEEMED RATHER SORRY TO LOSE HIS FRIENDS BUT THE PEOPLE WERE SECRETLY GLAD TO GET RID OF THE STRANGERS ESPECIALLY OF THE PINKIES
WE WERE ALL THIRSTY YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY SPRY AND FLIGHTY MAJESTY REMARKED THE CAPTAIN RESPECTFULLY IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THE WEAPONS OF THE PINKIES ARE SUPERIOR TO OUR OWN
ILLUSTRATION TROT COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER SHE WAS SO WORRIED OVER CAP'N BILL
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE YOUR COUNTRY BUT IT'S A MITE TOO DAMP FOR US AN WE'D BE GLAD TO GET OUT OF IT FOLLOW ME SAID THE FROG
THIS WAS A SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE CHILD BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT THE UMBRELLA WAS SURELY SOME PLACE IN THE BLUE CITY SO THERE WAS NO NEED TO DESPAIR
BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD HEARD THE PARROT SQUAWKING
ALTHOUGH THE NATIVES HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THIS ANY HUMAN BEINGS MADE AS BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE THEY TOOK A STRONG DISLIKE TO THE STRANGERS AND SEVERAL TIMES THREATENED TO ATTACK THEM
WE'VE GOT TO EAT OUR APPLES YET APPLES--APPLES
THEN THE QUEEN ASKED THE STRANGERS TO STEP OUTSIDE WHILE THEY COUNSELED TOGETHER
EVER'THING IN THE PALACE NOW BELONGS TO GHIP-GHISIZZLE EXCEPT THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES EXCLAIMED THE NEW BOOLOOROO EARNESTLY
AH HE EXCLAIMED PRESENTLY IT IS JUST AS I SUSPECTED
ONE OF MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHERS WAS A KNIGHT--AN ARABIAN KNIGHT--AND IT WAS HE WHO FIRST FOUND THIS UMBRELLA AN ARABIAN NIGHT EXCLAIMED TROT
I'LL BE CAREFUL IT WAS REALLY A WONDERFUL EXHILARATING RIDE AND CAP'N BILL WASN'T LONG MAKING UP HIS MIND HE LIKED THE SENSATION
WHAT'S BECOME OF TIGGLE HE SHOUTED
HE SAYS HE'S FROM PHILLYDELFY WHICH IS A BIG CITY WAY AT THE OTHER END OF AMERICA ARE YOU ASKED THE SAILOR SURPRISED
SINCE GHIP-GHISIZZLE WAS TO BE THE NEXT BOOLOOROO THE KING SUSPECTED HIM FIRST OF ALL SO HE HAD THE MAJORDOMO BOUND WITH CORDS AND BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN HE ACCUSED HIM OF STEALING THE BOOK OF RECORDS
THERE GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND ROSALIE WERE AWAITING THEM AND THEY ALL WENT INTO THE WITCH'S TENT AND HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR
HE HAD DISAPPEARED AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS HAD GHIP-GHISIZZLE
BUT THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HE COULD AVOID BEING CAUGHT BY THE PINKIES THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO HARM HIM
THOSE WHO EXAMINE THE HEAVENS IN THESE DAYS ALAS
I'M BUSY NOW THEY ARE MARCHING ON THE CITY SAID THE FRIGHTENED MESSENGER
ON SWEPT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE AND WHY YOU HAVE COME HERE BETWEEN THEM THEY TOLD THE STORY OF HOW THE MAGIC UMBRELLA HAD TAKEN THEM TO SKY ISLAND WHICH THEY DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY STARTED WAS ANYWHERE IN EXISTENCE
WHAT DID I TELL YOU TOURMALINE JUST THEN ONE OF THE MAIDENS TRIPPED LIGHTLY DOWN THE SPAN OF THE ARCH UNTIL NEAR THE VERY END LEANING OVER TO OBSERVE THE GROUP BELOW
I'LL NOT BE GONE LONG FOR I'M NO FAVORITE OF THE BOOLOOROO EITHER SO PLEASE STAY QUIETLY IN THIS ROOM UNTIL MY RETURN THE MAJORDOMO FOUND THE BOOLOOROO IN A BAD TEMPER
THE GIRLS WITH BROTHERS ARE BOSSY AN THE GIRLS WITHOUT BROTHERS HAVEN'T ANY GO TO EM
TROT EXCLAIMED THE SAILOR RECOGNIZING HER VOICE
THE BOOLOOROO STARED A MOMENT AND THEN HE FELL BACK IN HIS THRONE LAUGHING BOISTEROUSLY
WHEN I WAS AROUND THE CORNER I THOUGHT I'D SEE IF I COULD FLY AS I HAD BEFORE
TO HER ASTONISHMENT THERE WAS NO REFLECTION AT ALL
TWO OF YOU SEIZE THE GIRL AND THROW HER OVER SAID TOURMALINE IN A CALM MATTER-OF-FACT WAY AND TWO OTHERS MUST THROW THE BOY OVER
SEE CAN'T SAY I DO SAID CAP'N BILL MUCH BEWILDERED
BY RECKLESSLY INTRUDING INTO OUR DOMAIN YOU HAVE BECOME A SLAVE AND BEING A SLAVE YOU MUST OBEY US OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES WHAT CONS'QUENCES ASKED THE GIRL
GEE I SAID I WISH I COULD FLY THROUGH THE AIR TO UNCLE BOB'S I WAS HOLDING UP THE OPEN UMBRELLA WHEN I SAID THAT AND AS SOON AS I SPOKE THE UMBRELLA BEGAN LIFTING ME UP INTO THE AIR
THE UMBRELLA WILL CARRY US THERE IN NO TIME LET'S GO REPEATED TROT
IT WAS A LITTLE DANGEROUS THOUGH REMAINING IN A ROOM WHERE SIX GIRLS WERE FEELING ALL AROUND FOR HER SO SHE WENT AWAY AND LEFT THEM TO THEIR VAIN SEARCH WHILE SHE RENEWED HER HUNT FOR CAP'N BILL
P'RAPS SAID TROT AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH SHE TRIED HARD TO THINK P'RAPS SKY ISLAND ISN'T THE NAME OF THAT ISLAND AT ALL WHY WE KNOW VERY WELL IT AIN'T THE NAME OF IT YELLED CAP'N BILL FROM BELOW
OH HE'D JUST SLICE YOU ALL IN HALVES AND THEN PATCH HALF OF THE BOY TO HALF OF THE GIRL AND THE OTHER HALF TO HALF OF YOU AND THE OTHER HALF OF YOU TO THE OTHER HALF OF THE GIRL
BUT THEY CAN'T GET AROUND WITHOUT LEGS TO FIND OUT THINGS CAP'N BILL GOT ROUND LIVELY NOUGH ONCE WHEN HE HAD TWO MEAT LEGS SHE SAID
BUT IF HE REALLY KNOWS EVERTHING HE KNOWS ABOUT THE MAGIC UMBRELLA SO I WON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT IT MAGIC CRIED TROT WITH BIG EAGER EYES
THEY MAINTAINED A SULLEN SILENCE WHILE CORALIE AND CAPTAIN TINTINT FORMED THEIR RANKS IN MARCHING ORDER AND THEY DID NOT EVEN CHEER WHEN TROT SAID TO THEM IN A FINAL SPEECH
THERE WERE HOUSES AND CASTLES AND SHOPS FOR THE MERCHANTS AND ALL WERE PRETTILY DESIGNED AND HAD MANY SLENDER SPIRES AND IMPOSING TURRETS THAT ROSE FAR INTO THE BLUE AIR
THEY ALL HAD SHORT NECKS AND LEGS PINK HAIR AND EYES ROSY CHEEKS AND PINK COMPLEXIONS AND THEIR FACES WERE GOOD-NATURED AND JOLLY IN EXPRESSION
HE HAD MARKED THE PLACE WELL SO HE COULDN'T MISS IT WHEN HE WANTED TO FIND IT AGAIN
THEN FLAPPING ITS EARS AND WAGGING ITS TAIL--WHICH WAS MERELY THE COVERED FRAME OF THE UMBRELLA--THE HUGE ELEPHANT LIFTED ITS TRUNK AND CHARGED THE LINE OF ASTONISHED FROGS
THEREFORE THE PRINCESSES WERE PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF CAP'N BILL'S BECOMING HALF A BILLYGOAT AND THE BILLYGOAT'S BEING HALF CAP'N BILL
SO IF YOU'LL LET US STAY WE WON'T BE ANY MORE TROUBLE TO YOU THAN WE CAN HELP THEY ALL GAZED UPON THE LITTLE GIRL CURIOUSLY AND ONE OF THEM SAID
NOW THEN LEMME THINK A MINUTE SAID THE SAILOR REFLECTIVELY
I SHALL KEEP WATCH OVER YOU BUTTON-BRIGHT SHE CALLED TO THE BOY
MEANTIME YOU WILL GO HOME WITH CORALIE WHO WILL FEED YOU AND GIVE YOU ENTERTAINMENT
ONCE OR TWICE THE LITTLE GIRL LOST HER WAY FOR THE STREETS WERE VERY PUZZLING TO ONE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THEM BUT FINALLY SHE SIGHTED THE GREAT PALACE AND WENT UP TO THE ENTRANCE
AT THE PALACE THEY FOUND THAT DINNER WAS ABOUT TO BE SERVED IN THE BIG DINING HALL OF THE SERVANTS AND DEPENDENTS AND HOUSEHOLD OFFICERS OF THE ROYAL BOOLOOROO
I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME JUST NOW AFTER YEARS OF WORRY AND UNCOMFORTABLE LIVING IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE OLD HUT OF A PALACE SAID THE POOR GIRL SO IT WOULD BE CRUEL FOR YOU TO MAKE ME THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE AGAIN AND CONDEMN ME TO WANT AND MISERY THAT SEEMS REASON'BLE REPLIED TROT THOUGHTFULLY
OF COURSE THE GUARD COULD NOT DISCOVER WHAT MADE THE NOISE AND TROT RAN LITTLE RISK AS SHE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO LET HIM TOUCH HER
CORALIE HERSELF WAS NOT THERE AS SHE HAD BEEN SUMMONED TO THE QUEEN'S PALACE BUT HER HUSBAND LOOKED AFTER THE GUESTS AND WHEN BREAKFAST WAS FINISHED HE SAID TO THEM
I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER AND TROT HAD HELPED WITH THE DISHES SHE JOINED BUTTON-BRIGHT AND THE SAILORMAN ON THE LITTLE PORCH AGAIN
YOU'RE SO DREADFULLY PINK HERE THAT YOUR COLOR WHICH IN ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL HAS BECOME TAME AND INSIPID
THE RULER OF A COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE TREATED WITH GREAT RESPEC DECLARED TROT A LITTLE INDIGNANTLY FOR SHE THOUGHT THE PRETTY LITTLE QUEEN WAS NOT BEING PROPERLY DEFERRED TO
WHAT'S TO BE DONE MATE TROT THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT
OTHERS WERE ALSO DISAPPOINTED BY HIS CAPTURE
BUTTON-BRIGHT AND TROT WERE STARING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT AT THE QUEEREST PERSON THEY HAD EVER SEEN
EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN IS A VOTER
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T LIVED MY SIX HUNDRED YEARS YET
I DON'T THINK IT REPLIED CAP'N BILL
THE OTHER FOUR PRINCESSES HEARING THE SCREAMS AND CRIES OF RAGE CAME RUNNING INTO COBALT'S ROOM AND AS FAST AS THEY APPEARED TROT THREW PILLOWS AT THEM SO THAT PRESENTLY ALL SIX WERE INDULGING IN A FREE-FOR-ALL BATTLE AND SNARLING LIKE TIGERS
THE SAILOR'S BIG BLUE EYES WATCHED IT DRAW NEAR AND SETTLE DOWN WITH ITS PASSENGERS UPON JUST THE SPOT IT HAD STARTED FROM
AFTER TROT HAD SIGNED HER NAME TO IT AS QUEEN SHE CALLED ALL OF THE IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE LAND TO ASSEMBLE IN THE COURT OF THE STATUES AND ORDERED THE ROYAL DECLAIMER TO READ TO THEM THE NEW LAW
AND THEN IT WOULD TURN TO TROT AND MOAN
BUT NEVER MIND THE BLUE WOLF
THE BOOLOOROO SEEMED QUITE THE QUEEREST OF ANYTHING AND TROT NOTICED THAT WHEN HE PULLED THE LONG CURL THAT STUCK UP FROM THE TOP OF HIS HEAD A BELL TINKLED SOMEWHERE IN THE PALACE
WE'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER SUCH CHANCE CAP'N
BUT THE BOOLOOROO STOLE IT NAUGH-TY NAUGH-TY BOO-LOO-ROO
YOU AREN'T SO BAD EITHER AN IF WE DON'T BOTH TURN OUT WORSE THAN WE SEEM WE OUGHT TO BE FRIENDS HE NODDED RATHER ABSENTLY AND TOSSED A PEBBLE INTO THE WATER
DON'T TRY TO DICTATE OLD MOONFACE FOR THERE'S ONLY ONE ROYAL WILL IN SKY ISLAND AND THAT'S MY OWN HE THEN GAVE A COMMAND TO A SOLDIER WHO HASTENED AWAY TO THE PALACE AND SOON RETURNED WITH A NUMBER OF LONG BLUE RIBBONS
BUT WE WON'T STAY LONG
BUT TROT NOW RAN UP IN FRONT OF THEM AND MADE A LITTLE SPEECH
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAS A BAD TIME CHAPTER 20
THAT RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER IS A PRETTY GOOD FAIRY
I'VE TOLD THE UMBRELLA TO TAKE US TO SKY ISLAND SO THAT'S THE EXACT PLACE WE'RE BOUND FOR
WE LIKE A FIGHT DECLARED THE PARROT IN REPLY
OF COURSE HE COULD NOT FIND IT AS IT WAS NOT THERE
NOT YET ANSWERED THE FROG KING IN A GRUFF DEEP VOICE
WHEN I STOPPED I LANDED OVER THERE BY THE BIG ROCK
WELL IF YOU MUST GO TROT I'VE PERVIDED A MACHINE THAT'LL CARRY YOU BOTH COMF'TABLE
I--I'D RATHER KEEP IT WITH ME IF YOU PLEASE HE PLEADED
THE BOOLOOROO IN HIS SEARCH HAD FAILED TO DISCOVER WHAT HAD BECOME OF GHIP-GHISIZZLE BUT THE POOR MAN HAD BEEN WORRIED EVERY MINUTE FOR FEAR HIS RETREAT WOULD BE DISCOVERED OR THAT THE TERRIBLE PRINCESSES WOULD COME FOR HIM AND NAG HIM UNTIL HE WENT CRAZY
HE DID NOT TELL THE BOOLOOROO OF THIS SUSPICION BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE KING WOULD REALIZE HE WAS SECURE AND THAT HIS DECEPTION COULD NEVER BE PROVED AGAINST HIM
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE JUST NOW YOUR SPRY AND FLIGHTY HIGH AND MIGHTY MAJESTY HE ANSWERED
IT'S REGARDED AS HALF-BIGAMY ILLUSTRATION DEAR ME CRIED COBALT
I CAN HAVE YOU PATCHED FOR THIS INSULT AND I WILL--JUST AS SURE AS I'M THE ROYAL BOOLOOROO OF SKY ISLAND OH IS THIS SKY ISLAND THEN ASKED TROT
BUT CAP'N BILL WAS MEEK AND MADE NO REPLY
I DUNNO BOUT THAT REMARKED CAP'N BILL
TOO MUCH SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN TO ANYONE
SO I HELD UP THE UMBRELLA AND WISHED I HAD AN ICE-CREAM SODA
OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
OH SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
YOU MIGHT BUMP ME IN THE NOSE ALL RIGHT SHE CALLED BACK
I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY SUCH LAW REPLIED THE QUEEN
THAT'S REAL KIND OF YOU YOUR JOB BUTTON-BRIGHT IS EASIER CONTINUED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
DON'T WORRY TROT CRIED BUTTON-BRIGHT
ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION THE CAPTURE OF CAP'N BILL CHAPTER 21
THE ROPES WERE ALL KNOTTED TOGETHER AT THE TOP WHERE THERE WAS A LOOP THAT COULD BE HOOKED UPON THE CROOKED HANDLE OF THE UMBRELLA
WHAT COUNTRY DID YOU COME FROM ASKED THE WOMAN WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN
GET OFF FROM ME
HERE WE ARE SAFE BACK AGAIN
BUTTON-BRIGHT HOW DID YOUR FATHER HAPPEN TO LET YOU TAKE THAT UMBRELLA HE DIDN'T I SAID
ONE END OF THE ROPE WAS STILL TIED TO THE HANDLE OF THE BASKET AND THE OTHER END TO HIS SWING SEAT WHICH LAY ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM
OH PARSNIPS--PAR-SNIPS--P-A-R-SNIPS HE CLOSED HIS EYES SLEEPILY AND RESUMED HIS DREAMS
IT WAS DARK AS PITCH IN THE ROOM AND TROT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A LIGHT
THINKING IT WAS THIS SISTER WHO HAD SLYLY ATTACKED HER INDIGO RUSHED AT THE SLEEPING COBALT AND SLAPPED HER FACE
TO-MORROW MORNING COME TO ME AGAIN AND THEN I WILL DECREE YOUR FATE THE LITTLE QUEEN THEN PICKED UP HER STOCKING AND BEGAN TO DARN THE HOLES IN IT AND CORALIE WITHOUT ANY FORMAL PARTING LED THE STRANGERS FROM THE MISERABLE PALACE
ILLUSTRATION THE BLUE CITY CHAPTER 8
WELL IF HE WENT TO ARABY OR WAS BORN THERE HE'D BE AN ARABIAN KNIGHT WOULDN'T HE
BUT THE MOST CURIOUS THING ABOUT HIM WAS HIS SKIN WHICH WAS OF A LOVELY SKY-BLUE TINT
A DREADFUL PLACE CALLED THE PINK COUNTRY
BUT THERE'S ALL SORTS O FAIRIES I'VE HEARD
WHILE I WAS THERE I NEVER HEARD THE EDGE MENTIONED
WE CAN MAKE A ROPE LADDER THAT WILL ENABLE YOU TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE WALL AND THEN YOU CAN LOWER IT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND DESCEND INTO THE CITY
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR NAME IS
YOUR EYES CAN ONLY SEE JUS SO FAR WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKIN AT A POND OR A GREAT SEA THEN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE HOW BIG AN OCEAN IS HE REPLIED
I'M TO BE THE NEXT BOOLOOROO OF SKY ISLAND GOOD FOR YOU CRIED THE SAILOR
IN THE CENTER STOOD THE GREAT KNIFE WHICH THE BOOLOOROO USED TO SPLIT PEOPLE IN TWO WHEN HE PATCHED THEM AND AT ONE SIDE WAS A DARK FORM HUDDLED UPON THE FLOOR AND SECURELY BOUND
AFTER BREAKFAST WAS OVER A PROCESSION WAS FORMED HEADED BY THE BOOLOOROO AND THEY MARCHED THE PRISONER THROUGH THE PALACE UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE
I DON'T MIND
TROT RAN IN AND CHANGED THE YARN WHILE BUTTON-BRIGHT STAYED OUTSIDE AND STARED AT THE PEOPLE WHO STARED AT HIM
IN THIS COUNTRY THE WOMEN SEEMED FULLY AS IMPORTANT AS THE MEN AND INSTEAD OF BEING CODDLED AND PETTED THEY PERFORMED THEIR SHARE OF THE WORK BOTH IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AFFAIRS AND WERE EXPECTED TO FIGHT IN THE WARS EXACTLY AS THE MEN DID
IT SAYS
TROT WAKENED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY TO SEE THE SUNRISE
OF COURSE
RELEASE THE PRISONERS
VERY WELL CAPTAIN
THEN SAID ROSALIE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS THAT THESE STRANGERS HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH NONE AT ALL THEY ADMITTED
THEY SCOWLED AND MUTTERED AND BEHAVED IN A VERY UNFRIENDLY WAY EVEN AFTER CAPTAIN ULTRAMARINE HAD EXPLAINED THAT THE NEWCOMERS WERE MERELY BASE SLAVES AND NOT TO BE CLASSED WITH THE FREE ROYAL SERVANTS OF THE PALACE
IF YOU EVER HAPPEN TO COME TO EARTH YOU MUST BE SURE TO VISIT ME AND I'LL TRY TO GIVE YOU A GOOD TIME
CAN'T YOU SEE ME NO REPLIED THE BOY MYSTIFIED
TO BE SURE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WAS NOW IN THE BLUE COUNTRY AND THE FAIRIES THAT DIRECTED ITS FLIGHT MIGHT BE WITH THE UMBRELLA INSTEAD OF WITH THEM YET THE OLD SAILOR HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME STRANGE ADVENTURES IN TROT'S COMPANY AND KNEW SHE HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE EVERY DANGER THAT HAD THREATENED
AS IT WAS STILL MUDDY UNDERFOOT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER TOOK A CLOAK FROM ONE OF THE WOMEN PARTLY ROLLED IT AND THREW IT UPON THE GROUND
EVERYONE IN THE PINK COUNTRY IS ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE RULER AND TO A HOUSE AND A GOOD LIVING EXCEPT ONLY THE BLUESKINS
IT IS INDEED RETURNED THE BLUESKIN
FACING JIMFRED HE SAID TO THE PATCHED MAN IN A SERIOUS TONE
ROLL HIM UP AGAIN SOLDIERS THE SOLDIERS AGAIN ROLLED THE FRAME IN POSITION HAVING FIRST PULLED THE GREAT KNIFE ONCE MORE TO THE TOP OF THE DERRICK
BY THE TIME TROT WAS DRESSED IN PINK AND HAD RETURNED TO THE ROOM THERE WAS AN EXCITED AND CLAMOROUS CROWD ASSEMBLED IN THE COURT AND POLYCHROME TOOK THE LITTLE GIRL'S HAND AND LED HER OUT TO GREET HER NEW SUBJECTS
OH YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
IF SHE HAD ASKED ANY QUESTIONS TO-DAY AND HAD FOUND OUT THEY INTENDED TO FLY IN THE AIR SHE MIGHT HAVE SERIOUSLY OBJECTED
WHAT ARE APPLES HE ASKED
I'M SOME ROYAL AN RAPTUROUS AN RIDIC'LOUS MYSELF AN I WON'T ALLOW ANY CHEAP BOOLOOROO TO ORDER ME ROUND ARE YOU OF ROYAL BIRTH ASKED AZURE SEEMING SURPRISED
TURN AROUND SO WE CAN GET UPON YOUR BACKS SAID ROSALIE
THERE WERE FEW SUCH PROJECTIONS BUT AFTER CREEPING ALONG THE WALL FOR A DISTANCE THEY SAW THE END OF A BROKEN FLAGSTAFF NEAR THE TOP EDGE
THEY WAITED A LONG TIME HOWEVER TO GIVE THE BOOLOOROO TIME TO GET TO SLEEP SO IT WAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN BUTTON-BRIGHT FINALLY TOOK THE SHOES IN HIS HAND AND STARTED FOR THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER
I SHALL CALL UPON ROSALIE THE WITCH
THIS ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN A CLEVER THOUGHT OF THE BOOLOOROO
YOU'RE--YOU'RE WHAT TROT BOOLOOROOESS
THE PINKIES WERE MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE FACT THAT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER WAS THEIR NEW QUEEN'S FRIEND AND THAT ROSALIE THE WITCH STOOD ON TROT'S LEFT HAND AND TREATED HER WITH HUMBLE DEFERENCE
WHEN I WERE YOUNGER--WHICH IS ANCIENT HISTORY--AN AFORE I HAD A WOODEN LEG I COULD CLIMB A SHIP'S ROPES WITH THE BEST OF EM AN WALK OUT ON A BOOM OR STAND ATOP A MAST
SOME OF THE BLUESKINS INSISTED THAT THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS MUST BE PUT OUT OF THE ROOM BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE SAID THEY COULD REMAIN AS THEY WERE THE FAVORED PETS OF THE LOVELY SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
IT ISN'T THE RAINY SEASON NOW REMARKED TROT WITH A SMILE
TROT FINDING THE WINDOW OPEN CAME AND LOOKED OUT AND SHE SAW THE MAJORDOMO'S TALL FORM HASTENING ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL
THE EARTH THEY REPEATED
HE WAS OLD NOT VERY TALL SOMEWHAT STOUT AND CHUBBY WITH A ROUND FACE A BALD HEAD AND A SCRAGGLY FRINGE OF REDDISH WHISKER UNDERNEATH HIS CHIN
I'D RATHER BE PATCHED THAN MARRY THE BEST OF THEM WHICH IS THE BEST ASKED BUTTON-BRIGHT
THE BODIES OF THESE PEOPLE WERE SHORT AND ROUND AND THEIR LEGS EXCEPTIONALLY LONG SO WHEN A BLUESKIN WALKED HE COVERED TWICE AS MUCH GROUND AT ONE STEP AS CAP'N BILL OR BUTTON-BRIGHT DID
THE BLUE CITY WAS QUITE EXTENSIVE AND CONSISTED OF MANY BROAD STREETS PAVED WITH BLUE MARBLE AND LINED WITH SPLENDID BUILDINGS OF THE SAME BEAUTIFUL MATERIAL
IN THIS FAVORED ISLAND WHICH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE A SNUBNOSE IS AN EVIDENCE OF HIGH BREEDING WHICH ANY LADY WOULD BE PROUD TO POSSESS ILLUSTRATION THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES NOW APPROACHED THE FOUNTAIN AND STOOD IN A ROW STARING WITH HAUGHTY LOOKS AT THE STRANGERS
THE WOMEN SEEMED JUST AS REPELLENT AS THE MEN AND BUTTON-BRIGHT BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES WERE AFTER ALL RATHER BETTER LOOKING THAN MOST OF THE FEMALES OF THE BLUE COUNTRY AND SO HAD A CERTAIN RIGHT TO BE PROUD AND HAUGHTY
BUT WE'RE DROPPING ALL RIGHT IT WAS A GRADUAL DESCENT
HE'S AN IGNORANT HIMSELF CAP'N BILL PACKED UP THE LUNCH BASKET
BUT IT SEEMS YOU VE GOT TO WAIT A HUNDRED YEARS OR MORE AFORE YOU CAN TAKE HIS PLACE GHIP-GHISIZZLE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR A TIME A FROWN UPON HIS BLUE FACE
COME LET US RETURN AT ONCE TO YOUR CITY AND EXAMINE YOUR BOOK OF LAWS
WHERE ARE MY SOLDIERS
ONLY IF YOU WIN YOU MUST PROMISE TO GIVE ME BACK MY MAGIC UMBRELLA AND LET US FLY AWAY TO OUR OWN HOMES AGAIN I WILL DO THAT MOST WILLINGLY AGREED GHIP-GHISIZZLE
POOR GHIP REALIZED THAT IF HE KEPT ON THE WALL HE WOULD MERELY CIRCLE THE CITY AND FINALLY BE CAUGHT
SHE IS THE SOLE RULER OF OUR COUNTRY SO THE WORD OF TOURMALINE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND SEEMS TO ME WE'VE HAD BOUT ENOUGH OF KINGS AN QUEENS REMARKED CAP'N BILL
ILLUSTRATION HELLO SAID THE BOY
THEIR LIVES WERE SO MONOTONOUS AND UNINTERESTING THAT THEY WELCOMED ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF EXCITEMENT
CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN SHE ADDED APPEALING TO THE PINKY WOMAN
AND IT ISN'T DIRTY WORK AT ALL
THE OLD SAILOR HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO MAKE A GOOD FIGHT FOR HIS BOY AND GIRL AS WELL AS FOR HIS OWN LIFE IF HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO SO
AND WELCOME CRIED TROT
IT WAS PERFECTLY FORMED AND GLISTENED WITH A DOZEN OR MORE SUPERB TINTINGS THAT WERE SO VIVID AND BRILLIANT AND BLENDED INTO ONE ANOTHER SO EXQUISITELY THAT EVERY ONE PAUSED TO GAZE ENRAPTURED UPON THE SIGHT
MUST WE FIGHT YOU ASKED THE WOMAN OR WILL YOU COME WITH US PEACEABLY WE'LL GO PEACEABLE ANSWERED CAP'N BILL
BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET ANY BLUESKIN TOUCH YOU FOR WHILE YOU ARE IN CONTACT WITH ANY PERSON YOU WILL BECOME VISIBLE
SHE KNEW THE CHILD WAS PERFECTLY SAFE WITH THE OLD SAILOR WHO CARED FOR TROT EVEN BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WOULD HAVE DONE
SO DID WE
I DON'T KNOW'S I WOULD SHE ADMITTED
THEY WERE NOT COWARDLY BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THEY MISTRUSTED THE BIG MAN WHO ON EARTH WAS NOT CONSIDERED BIG AT ALL BUT RATHER UNDERSIZED
THEN SHE SEATED HERSELF IN AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE AND QUIETLY WAITED
CAP'N GRIFFITH IS MY FATHER
THE THREE STRANGERS ARE ALL INHARMONIOUS
WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY--SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD--AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
TWO WERE MEN AND TWO WERE WOMEN AND THEIR APPEARANCE WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE BLUESKINS
THEY KNEW THEY WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF THE BLUESKINS FOR THEY COULD HEAR THE SHOUTS OF THEIR PURSUERS GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY MINUTE SINCE THEIR LONG LEGS COVERED THE GROUND MORE QUICKLY THAN OUR FRIENDS COULD POSSIBLY GO
NO MORE DO I MATE HE ANSWERED
SAY WHAT'S YOUR NAME I'M MAYRE GRIFFITH
FEARING HIS IMPORTANT PRISONER MIGHT ESCAPE BEFORE HE WAS PATCHED AS GHIP-GHISIZZLE HAD DONE THE CRUEL KING OF THE BLUES HAD KEPT CAP'N BILL IN HIS PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND HAD TIED HIS OWN BIG TOE TO THE PRISONER'S BIG TOE SO THAT IF THE SAILOR MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO GET AWAY HE WOULD PULL ON THE CORD AND THAT WOULD AROUSE THE BOOLOOROO
ALL RIGHT HE SAID
THIS IS A REPUBLIC YOU KNOW
SHE WAITED UNTIL THE SENTRY WHO WAS PACING THE CORRIDOR HAD HIS BACK TOWARD HER AND THEN SHE TURNED THE KEY AND SLIPPED WITHIN SOFTLY CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER
WE'LL GET THE SIX SNUBNOSES TOO AND MAKE'EM ALL FEEL MIGHTY BLUE EITHER THAT OR THE OTHER THING SAID TROT
IT WAS PRETTY DARK IN THE HALL AND ONLY A FEW DIM BLUE LIGHTS SHOWED AT INTERVALS DOWN THE LONG CORRIDORS
THERE'S A BLUE WOLF IN THE TREASURE CHAMBER EXCLAIMED TROT
NOT EVEN A BIRD CAGE SAID SHE
SUDDENLY CAP'N BILL TRIPPED AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN FLAT HAD NOT TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT HELD HIM UP
OF COURSE REJOINED THE SIX PRINCESSES WITHOUT A SECOND'S HESITATION
MANY MORE WERE EAGER TO GO BUT THE WITCH THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH
THAT'S TAKING A GOOD DEAL FOR GRANTED
AND WELCOME ROARED THE BLUE SOLDIERS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE BLUE CITY
BY THIS TIME HE'S IN HIDING WHERE HE CAN'T BE FOUND THAT'S GOOD SAID CAP'N BILL NODDING APPROVAL
AT THIS THE RULER OF THE BLUES STOPPED SHORT IN HIS FLIGHT TO YELL WITH TERROR BUT SEEING THAT ONLY THE SAILORMAN WAS PURSUING THEM AND THAT THIS SOLITARY FOE HAD TUMBLED FLAT UPON THE GROUND HE ISSUED A COMMAND AND SEVERAL OF HIS PEOPLE FELL UPON POOR CAP'N BILL SEIZED HIM IN THEIR LONG ARMS AND CARRIED HIM STRUGGLING INTO THE CITY WHERE HE WAS FAST BOUND
MAKE ANOTHER SEAT CAP'N AND SWING IT RIGHT UNDER OURS
WHERE IS IT LOCATED WHY DOWN BELOW SOMEWHERE SAID THE BOY WHO DID NOT KNOW IN WHICH DIRECTION THE EARTH LAY
OUTSIDE THE PALACE JIMFRED AND FREDJIM ARE ON GUARD BUT IF YOU TIP OVER THE BENCH THEY ARE SEATED ON YOU CAN EASILY ESCAPE THEM I'LL DO THAT ALL RIGHT PROMISED THE DELIGHTED TIGGLE
I AIN'T MATE
ILLUSTRATION THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES CHAPTER 6
COULDN'T YOU LET YOURSELF DOWN WITH ONE OF THE SHEETS FROM THE BED I'LL TRY HE REJOINED
LET TROT DO IT OR YOU'LL RUE IT ADVISED THE PARROT AND THEN HE BARKED LIKE A DOG AND MADE THEM ALL JUMP
CAP'N BILL STRAIGHTENED OUT THE ROPES AND ADJUSTED THE SEATS WHILE BUTTON-BRIGHT EXAMINED THE UMBRELLA TO SEE IF IT HAD BEEN INJURED IN ANY WAY WHEN THE ELEPHANT TRAMPED THROUGH THE FOG BANK
SEEMS SO THE OLD SAILOR REPLIED
THE OPEN SPACE WHICH THEY ENTERED WAS PAVED WITH PINK MARBLE AND AROUND IT WERE TWO ROWS OF LARGE PINK STATUES AT LEAST LIFE-SIZE AND BEAUTIFULLY SCULPTURED
WHAT IN THE SKY DO YOU MEAN BY SITTING ON MY FEET
TROT WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE DECISION AND FOR A MOMENT SHE THOUGHT HER HEART HAD STOPPED BEATING FOR A WAVE OF FEAR SWEPT OVER HER
DING-DONG CRIED THE PARROT
IF YOU WANT ANY DINNER YOU'LL FIND IT IN THE SERVANTS HALL
HE COULD NOT EVEN GROWL OR YELP BUT ROLLED UPON THE FLOOR TRYING IN VAIN TO RELEASE HIMSELF FROM THE CONQUERING PILLOW
BY THE TIME SHE CAME OUT LUGGING THE BASKET WITH BOTH HANDS CAP'N BILL APPEARED WITH THE NEW SEAT HE HAD MADE FOR HIS OWN USE WHICH HE ATTACHED BY MEANS OF ROPES TO THE DOUBLE SEAT OF THE BOY AND GIRL
AWAY THEY HASTENED ACROSS THE PINK FIELDS TO THE PINK CITY WHERE ALL THE PINK PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND RAN OUT TO WELCOME THEM HOME AGAIN
THE NEXT MORNING ROSALIE SAID TO THE LITTLE GIRL
HE HAD DISCOVERED THE LOSS OF THE BOOK OF RECORDS AND AFTER BEING FRIGHTENED MOST TO DEATH AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE'S BEING MADE PUBLIC HE DECIDED TO ACT BOLDLY AND HOLD HIS POSITION AS BOOLOOROO AT ANY COST
I'M NOT SMART
IT'S A DROP O TEN FEET TROT HE EXCLAIMED
AN HAVE TO WAIT ON THE SNUBNOSES INSTEAD OF BEIN A QUEEN SAID TROT
WE MUST ESCAPE FROM HERE AT ONCE OR WE WILL BE CAUGHT AND PATCHED WHERE'S THE UMBREL ASKED CAP'N BILL
EVERYONE HATES ME AND I DON'T OBJECT TO THAT BECAUSE I HATE EVERYBODY
ANY TIME SUITS ME SAID THE BOY
IT WAS WHOLE AND STRONG AND BIG AND WOULD KEEP ME FROM GETTING WET ON THE WAY TO UNCLE BOB'S
EVERY TIME SHE MADE A NOISE SOME ONE GROANED AND THAT MADE THE CHILD UNEASY
MANY SHADES OF COLOR WERE THERE OF COURSE GRADING FROM A FAINT BLUSH ROSE TO DEEP PINK VERGING ON RED BUT NO OTHER COLOR WAS VISIBLE
HUSH-SH-SH CRIED EVERYONE IN A CHORUS AND THEY ALL LOOKED OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AS IF FRIGHTENED BY THE QUESTION
ONE OF THEM MEANS TO MARRY HIM EXPLAINED TIGGLE
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL GAZING FAR OUT OVER THE WATER
SO BEING PROTECTED FROM THE MUD AND WET THEY SPEEDILY GAINED THE CITY AND IN A SHORT TIME WERE ALL GATHERED IN THE LOW ROOM OF TOURMALINE'S PALACE WHERE THE GREAT BOOK OF LAWS LAY UPON A TABLE
CERTAINLY ANSWERED CORALIE'S HUSBAND
AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN
IT WAS A PRETTY CAT AND INSTANTLY KNEW THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A FRIEND--VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM ITS OWN BAD-TEMPERED MISTRESS--SO IT SANG BEAUTIFULLY AS A BIRD SINGS AND BOTH THE CAT AND THE DOG FOLLOWED TROT INTO THE THIRD BOUDOIR
WE'VE NEVER BEEN THERE YET YOU KNOW THE SAILOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
THERE THIS PRINCESS THE CROSSEST AND MOST DISAGREEABLE OF ALL THE DISAGREEABLE SIX WAS CURLED UP IN BED AND SLUMBERING COSILY
IS SUPPER READY MAMA BUTTON-BRIGHT STAYED ALL NIGHT WITH THEM BUT NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY HE HOOKED ONE OF THE SEATS TO HIS MAGIC UMBRELLA SAID GOOD-BYE TO TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND FLEW INTO THE AIR TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TO PHILADELPHIA
YOU SLAVE SHALL BE THE ROYAL BOOTBLUE
SO NOW QUEEN TROT WHAT'S NEXT ON THE PROGRAM NEXT SAID TROT WE'RE GOIN TO HUNT FOR THAT UMBREL CAP'N
I PUT DOWN THE UMBRELLA AND ASKED A MAN WHAT THE NAME OF THE CITY WAS AND HE SAID BUFFALO HOW WONDERFUL GASPED TROT
THESE POOR STRANGERS ARE IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION AND I WISH I COULD HELP THEM TO GET BACK TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY THANK YOU SAID TROT
A SEAT HAD BEEN BUILT AROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE FOR THIS WAS A FAVORITE SPOT FOR TROT AND CAP'N BILL TO SIT AND TALK AND WATCH THE FLEET OF FISHING BOATS SAIL TO AND FROM THE VILLAGE
THEY WERE OF COURSE STATUES OF PINKY MEN AND WOMEN AND ALL HAD BANDS OF PINK METAL AROUND THEIR FOREHEADS IN THE CENTER OF EACH BAND BEING A GLISTENING PINK JEWEL
THEY SANG AND SHOUTED WITH GLEE AND THE BAND UNCOVERED ITS PINK INSTRUMENTS AND PLAYED THE NATIONAL PINK ANTHEM WHILE THE PARROT FLEW FROM TROT'S SHOULDER TO CAP'N BILL'S SHOULDER AND BACK AGAIN SCREAMING ECSTATICALLY
THAT IS THE ROYAL TREASURE CHAMBER BUTTON-BRIGHT NODDED
BOTH TRIBES ACKNOWLEDGED TOURMALINE THEIR QUEEN AND OBEYED THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY AND JUST AT THIS TIME THERE WAS PEACE IN THE LAND AND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EAST AND WEST WERE FRIENDLY
THE SOLDIERS HAD PARTLY RECOVERED THEIR COURAGE AND FEARFUL OF THE ANGER OF THEIR DREADED BOOLOOROO WHOM THE PRINCESSES DECLARED WOULD PUNISH THEM SEVERELY HAD VENTURED TO RETURN TO THE ROOM
GIVE ME TIME
BY ROSALIE'S ADVICE THE ARMY OF CONQUEST CONSISTED OF ONE HUNDRED SUNSETS AND ONE HUNDRED SUNRISES
BY MEANS OF A MAGIC UMBRELLA WHICH I HAVE CAPTURED AND PUT AWAY IN MY TREASURE CHAMBER REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO
DON'T WORRY THEN HE GRASPED THE SHEET WITH BOTH HANDS AND EASILY LET HIMSELF DOWN TO THE WALL
NOW NO ONE CAN OBJECT TO BECOMING THE QUEEN SINCE THE RULER OF THE PINKIES WILL NO LONGER BE OBLIGED TO ENDURE SUFFERING AND HARDSHIPS ALL RIGHT SAID TROT
AT ONCE THE PINKIES WERE FORGOTTEN FOR THERE UPON THE FLOOR TIGHTLY BOUND LAY GHIP-GHISIZZLE AND BESIDE HIM POOR TIGGLE WHO HAD UTTERED THE MOANS
MORE GUARDS WERE YELLING NOW RUNNING ALONG THE FOOT OF THE WALL TO KEEP THE FUGITIVE IN SIGHT AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO POUR OUT OF THE HOUSES AND JOIN IN THE CHASE
THAT'S DIFFERENT OF COURSE
BUT IF THAT DON'T SATISFY YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT
IT WILL GO HARD WITH THIS LITTLE SHORT-NECKED CREATURE IF HE DOESN'T POLISH THE SHOES PROPERLY THEN GHIP-GHISIZZLE LEFT BUTTON-BRIGHT AND WENT AWAY AND THE BOY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL ROOMS TO THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER WHERE HIS MAJESTY SAT UNDRESSING
I'M THE QUEEN OF THE PINKIES JUST NOW AM I NOT SHE ASKED
IT WAS GROWING DUSK AS CAP'N BILL UNHOOKED THE SEATS AND BUTTON-BRIGHT FOLDED UP THE UMBRELLA AND TUCKED IT UNDER HIS ARM
ACROSS HER BROW HOWEVER WAS A BAND OF ROSE GOLD IN THE CENTER OF WHICH WAS SET A LUMINOUS PINK JEWEL WHICH GLEAMED MORE BRILLIANTLY THAN A DIAMOND
JUST AS SOON AS WE CAN GET THE ARMY TOGETHER AND READY DECIDED THE WITCH
AH SAID THE KING WITH A FROWN HERE COME THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES--THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND ARISTOCRATIC LADIES IN SKY ISLAND THEY'RE SNUBNOSED ALL RIGHT OBSERVED TROT LOOKING AT THE GIRLS WITH MUCH INTEREST
IT'S NO PLACE FOR ME ANYHOW FOR I BELONG IN THE CONSTELLATIONS YOU KNOW WITH TAURUS AND GEMINI AND THE OTHER FELLOWS
BUT THE UMBRELLA'S GOT TO GO WITH US IT CAN'T GO ANOTHER INCH CRIED THE OBSTINATE FROG WITH AN ANGRY CROAK NOR SHALL ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE ADVANCE ANOTHER STEP WHILE THAT INSULTING UMBRELLA IS WITH YOU TROT TURNED TO ROSALIE
THE QUEEN SAYS THEY WILL I KNOW SAID ROSALIE
BUT TROT PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM
THE ROYAL SCRIBBLER WROTE IT VERY NICELY IN PINK INK WITH A BIG CAPITAL LETTER AT THE BEGINNING AND A FINE FLOURISH AT THE END
I DON'T LIKE THESE SNUBNOSED FUSSY FEMALES AN I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH EM HOW IMPUDENT CRIED CERULIA
L
AND THEY ALL AGREED WITH HIM
I WAS AWFUL SCARED AT FIRST BUT I HELD ON TIGHT TO THE HANDLE AND IT DIDN'T PULL VERY MUCH EITHER
CHAPTER 30
WHEN ALL WAS READY THEY WENT INTO THE COURT OF THE STATUES WHERE ALL THE PINKIES WERE ASSEMBLED--TOGETHER WITH THEIR PINK BAND--AND CAP'N BILL HOOKED THE SWINGING SEATS ONTO THE HANDLE OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA
IF YOU ARE GOOD AND OBEDIENT YOU WON'T GET YOUR EARS BOXED OFTENER THAN ONCE AN HOUR I WON'T BE ANYBODY'S SLAVE PROTESTED TROT
WHEN THIS BROKE AWAY THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF A MAJESTIC RAINBOW SPANNING THE HEAVENS ITS GORGEOUS COLORS GLINTING BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN ITS ARCH PERFECT AND UNBROKEN FROM END TO END
THEN HE RENEWED HIS SEARCH FOR THE UMBRELLA BUT IT WAS QUITE IN VAIN
WHAT CAN THE ANSWER BE TROT LOOKED THE BOY OVER CAREFULLY
IT BEATS RIDIN IN A BOAT OR--OR--IN ANYTHING ELSE
I MUST INSTRUCT YOU IN YOUR DUTIES SAID HE WHEN THEY WERE ALL COMFORTABLY SEATED IN COSY CHAIRS WITH BLUE CUSHIONS
WE POLLYS KNOW OUR BUSINESS AND WE'RE--ALL--RIGHT
BUT THE SLEEPY GUARD BEFORE THE KING'S APARTMENTS WAS CROSS AND SURLY
WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE THEY'RE JUICY
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO SKY ISLAND ILLUSTRATION THE FAMOUS OZ BOOKS BY L
THE KNIFE WAS BUILT INTO A HUGE FRAMEWORK LIKE A DERRICK THAT REACHED TO THE CEILING AND IT WAS SO ARRANGED THAT WHEN THE BOOLOOROO PULLED A CORD THE GREAT BLADE WOULD DROP DOWN IN ITS FRAME AND NEATLY CUT IN TWO THE PERSON WHO STOOD UNDER IT
YOU'LL SOON LEARN
I'VE KEP MY FACE TURNED STRAIGHT AHEAD EVER SINCE WE CLIMBED INTER THIS BANK O WETNESS
THEY NOTICED THAT THE FOG HAD CAUGHT A SOFT ROSE TINT AND WAS LIGHTER AND LESS DENSE THAN BEFORE FOR WHICH REASON THE SAILOR REMARKED THAT THEY MUST BE GETTING NEAR TO THE PINK COUNTRY
AND IF YOU CAN THINK OF A WAY YOU MUST TRY TO RESCUE US
BUT IT WERE A PRETTY CLOSE CALL AN I HOPE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER SAID THE GIRL
CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WENT DOWN TO THE CABIN OF THE FORMER BOOLOOROO AND TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE UMBRELLA BUT THE OLD BOOLOOROO SAID
THEN HE FLEW INTO A MIGHTY RAGE AND RUNNING OUT INTO THE HALL HE AIMED A BLOW AT THE UNFAITHFUL GUARD KNOCKING THE FELLOW OFF HIS FEET
BUT YOU MAY INQUIRE OF THE PALACE SERVANTS AND PERHAPS THE ROYAL CHEF OR THE MAJORDOMO WILL CONDESCEND TO TELL YOU
YOU SEEM TIRED OUT
I AM QUITE SURE I CAN FIND IN THEM ABSOLUTE PROTECTION FOR THESE POOR WANDERERS THEY DARED NOT DISOBEY POLYCHROME'S REQUEST SO AT ONCE THEY ALL TURNED AND WALKED BACK TO THE CITY
IF I GET YOU OUT OF THE PALACE CAN YOU HIDE YOURSELF SO THAT YOU WON'T BE FOUND CERTAINLY HE DECLARED
OR A NECKTIE MIXER ADDED CAP'N BILL
THE WITCH TOSSED UP THE LADDER TRYING TO CATCH IT UPON THIS POINT AND ON THE SEVENTH ATTEMPT SHE SUCCEEDED
KILL ME
TROT CARRIED ROSALIE AND CAPTAIN CORALIE AND GHIP-GHISIZZLE TO THE PALACE AND OF COURSE BUTTON-BRIGHT AND CAP'N BILL WERE WITH HER
WHAT QUEER DREADFUL-LOOKING CREATURES ARE THESE
I KNOW OF ONE WITCH SAID TOURMALINE THOUGHTFULLY BUT SHE IS NOT VERY OBLIGING
THEN THEY ROLLED THE FRAME UNDERNEATH THE GREAT KNIFE AND HANDED THE BOOLOOROO THE CORD THAT RELEASED THE BLADE
THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN IN TORRENTS AND UMBRELLAS WERE UNKNOWN
IT WAS LOCKED BUT THE KEY WAS OUTSIDE AS THE BLUESKINS SELDOM TOOK A DOOR-KEY AWAY FROM ITS PLACE
THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG--PERHAPS TWO OR THREE DAYS GOOD CRIED CAP'N BILL AND THE PARROT SCREAMED
SO HE MADE ME GO RIGHT HOME TO PUT THE UMBRELLA BACK WHERE I GOT IT
SEEMS TO ME YOU COULD WALK ACROSS THE WHOLE ISLAND IN AN HOUR SAID THE BOY
THE PINKIES TRIED TO CHASE THEM BUT THEIR ROUND FAT LEGS WERE NO MATCH FOR THE LONG THIN LEGS OF THE BLUESKINS WHO QUICKLY GAINED THE GATE AND SHUT THEMSELVES UP IN THE CITY AGAIN
THERE THEY FOUND QUITE A NUMBER OF PINKIES ASSEMBLED AND A SPIRITED DISCUSSION WAS TAKING PLACE WHEN THEY ARRIVED
HOPE YE FEEL AS WELL AS YE LOOK PAPA EXCLAIMED TURQUOISE ANGRILY CAN YOU NOT PREVENT THIS VILE EARTH BEING FROM ADDRESSING US
BUT I TOLD HIM MY FATHER HAD NEVER HANDED IT TO ME THOUGH I'M HIS SON
IT IS THE LAW AND WE ALL OBEY IT IT SAVES FUNERAL EXPENSES ANYHOW REMARKED CAP'N BILL
THAT WAS IN THE DARK AGES I GUESS WHEN THE MAGIC ARABIAN NIGHTS WAS
WITH THIS I SHALL BE ABLE TO FORCE HIM TO RESIGN THAT I MAY TAKE HIS PLACE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT ME AND ABIDE BY THE LAW
ADJOINING EACH SLEEPING ROOM WAS A MARBLE BATH AND EACH PRINCESS HAD A SEPARATE BOUDOIR AND A DRESSING ROOM
SIR SAID HE THERE LIES ALL MY TROUBLE
THE PEOPLE ELECT ALL THEIR OFFICERS FROM THE KING DOWN
ISN'T PASS'N AWAY JUS THE SAME AS DYIN NO INDEED
AND DON'T WASTE ANY TIME EITHER FOR AS SOON AS WE FIND OUT THE SECRET OF THE UMBRELLA I'M GOING TO HAVE THE THREE STRANGERS MARCHED THROUGH THE ARCH OF PHINIS--AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF THEM YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE MAJORDOMO
MOTHER IS A LITTLE CROSS TO-DAY AND SHE WANTS TO FINISH KNITTING YOUR NEW STOCKIN
ILLUSTRATION GHIP-GHISIZZLE PROVES FRIENDLY CHAPTER 7
IT RAINS QUITE OFTEN AND ALTHOUGH IT MAKES THE FLOWERS AND THE GRASS GROW I THINK RAIN IS VERY DISAGREEABLE
COME LET'S GET AWAY AT ONCE WHERE'LL WE GO INQUIRED TROT
CAN'T I DO IT
CAN'T ANY OF YOU REMEMBER TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YEARS BACK WHEN HE FIRST BEGAN TO RULE NO SAID GHIP-GHISIZZLE
YOUR FOLKS OUGHT TO TREAT YOU WITH GREAT RESPECT AS TROT SAYS OH NO RESPONDED TOURMALINE QUICKLY
ROSALIE WHO LONGED TO PLEASE THE POWERFUL POLYCHROME WHOSE FAIRY POWERS AS DAUGHTER OF THE RAINBOW WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO HER OWN WITCHCRAFT PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO QUEEN MAYRE AS LONG AS SHE MIGHT NEED HER SERVICES
AS A MATTER O FACT WE'VE CAPTURED YOUR WHOLE BLOOMIN BLUE ISLAND BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE PLACE VERY MUCH AND I GUESS WE'LL GIVE IT BACK
AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT SHE BEGAN FEELING HER WAY TO THE WINDOW STUMBLING OVER OBJECTS AS SHE WENT
THAT WAS THE WAY BUT HOW DID YOU GET UP THERE ASKED TROT
BUT NOW AN IDEA OCCURRED TO THE GIRL
GUESS THEY DON'T GROW ANYWHERE BUT ON THE EARTH REMARKED CAP'N BILL
WE'LL PUT IT DOWN IF YOU LIKE AN CROSS THE BANK IN THIS DRIZZLE--WHICH MAY BE CLINGIN AN SOULFUL BUT IS TOO WET TO BE COMFORT'BLE
GET THE LUNCH TROT IF YOUR MOTHER'LL LET YOU HAVE IT AND I'LL RIG UP THE SEAT HE WENT INTO THE SHED AND TROT WENT TO HER MOTHER
THEN PRINCESS COBALT CAME UP AND SLAPPED ONE SIDE OF THE SLAVE'S FACE AND PRINCESS TURQUOISE RAN FORWARD AND SLAPPED THE OTHER SIDE
HERE WAS A BLUESKIN GUARD WHO HAD BEEN PEACEFULLY SLUMBERING WHEN AROUSED BY THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE FUGITIVES
BUT GHIP-GHISIZZLE DID NOT HEED THE SHOUTING
THE WAR IS OVER AN EVER'BODY MUST BE SOCIABLE AN HAPPY OR I'LL KNOW THE REASON WHY NOW INDEED THE PINKIES RAISED A GREAT SHOUT OF JOY AND THE BLUES RESPONDED WITH ANOTHER JOYFUL SHOUT AND ROSALIE KISSED THE LITTLE GIRL AND SAID SHE HAD PERFORMED WONDERS AND EVERYBODY SHOOK HANDS WITH CAP'N BILL AND CONGRATULATED HIM UPON HIS ESCAPE AND THE PARROT FLEW TO TROT'S SHOULDER AND SCREECHED
BUT THE WICKED BOOLOOROO STOLE IT FROM US STOLE IT
THE GIRL NOW TOOK OFF ROSALIE'S RING AND PUT IT CAREFULLY AWAY IN HER POCKET
ARE YOU ADDRESSING THAT WORD TO ME O COURSE MA'AM ANSWERED CAP'N BILL
THEN SHE TURNED TO ROSALIE AND ASKED
A FELLER NAMED TIGGLE WHO'S IN DISGRACE CAUSE HE MIXED THE ROYAL NECKTIE FOR ME THAT WAS NECTAR--NOT NECKTIE CORRECTED TROT
IT WAS NEARLY DARK AND I WAS TOO TIRED AND HUNGRY TO MAKE THE TRIP HOME AGAIN
WHERE IN ALL THE SKY DID THEY COME FROM THEY SAY THEY CAME FROM THE EARTH CERULIA ANSWERED THE BOOLOOROO
ON THE BACK OF THE KING FROG RODE TROT AND HER PARROT BESIDES ROSALIE BUTTON-BRIGHT CAP'N BILL AND THE CAPTAINS OF THE TWO COMPANIES OF THE ARMY
THE SAILOR FOLLOWED AND PULLED OUT THE BOOLOOROO WHO WHEN HE SAW THE TERRIBLE GOAT WAS CAPTURED AND TIED FAST QUICKLY RECOVERED HIS COURAGE
NOT MUCH ANYHOW ASSERTED TROT BRAVELY
BUT THE ANGRY INHABITANT OF THIS BLUE PLACE WOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO LOOK AROUND THEM IN PEACE FOR AS SOON AS CAP'N BILL ROLLED OFF HIS TOES HE BEGAN DANCING AROUND IN AN EXCITED WAY AND SAYING VERY DISRESPECTFUL THINGS OF HIS VISITORS
IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO GET CLEAN OFF'N SKY ISLAND I'D RATHER STAY WITH THE PINKIES THAN WITH THE BLUES I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL DO WITH US SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
WHEN I WAS IN CHICAGO I SAW LAKE MICHIGAN HE WENT ON DREAMILY AND IT LOOKED JUST AS BIG AS THIS WATER DOES LOOKS DON'T COUNT WITH OCEANS SHE ASSERTED
THE HARDEST PART OF ROSALIE'S TASK WAS TO TOSS UP ONE END OF THE ROPE LADDER UNTIL IT WOULD CATCH ON SOME PROJECTION ON TOP OF THE WALL
THE PARROT WAS NOW ON CAP'N BILL'S SHOULDER FOR TROT THOUGHT A QUEEN OUGHT NOT TO CARRY A BIRD AROUND
NO SLAVE EVER WANTS TO OBEY BUT HE JUST HAS TO
FOR-WARD--MARCH ROARED TINTINT TO THE SUNRISE PEOPLE
HAVEN'T WE TROT THE BES TIME I EVER HAD SHE REPLIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT HAD NOW BECOME WORRIED AND ANXIOUS FOR THEY KNEW IF THEY WERE TOSSED OVER THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND THEY WOULD BE KILLED
ONCE THERE WAS A KING OF THE PINKIES WHO WAS CRUEL AND OVERBEARING AND IMAGINED HE WAS SUPERIOR TO THE PEOPLE HE RULED SO ONE DAY HIS SUBJECTS CARRIED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND AND THREW HIM OVER THE BUSHES GOODNESS ME SAID TROT
WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE CEREMONY OF PATCHING AT ONCE CAP'N BILL REGARDED THE BILLYGOAT WITH DISTINCT DISFAVOR AND THE BILLYGOAT GLARED EVILLY UPON CAP'N BILL
THAT PINK COUNTRY SOUNDS KIND O CHEERFUL TO ME
DON'T YOU THINK SO ROSALIE IT WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING I EVER SAW ADMITTED THE WITCH
IF HE'S PATCHED HE NEVER CAN BE BOOLOOROO THEN HE MUSTN'T BE PATCHED DECLARED SAPPHIRE
IMMEDIATELY THE BOOLOOROO FLEW INTO ANOTHER TOWERING RAGE
BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD MAKE EM MAD TO CALL EM THAT WHY ASKED THE BOOLOOROO IN SURPRISE
SO THEY ACCOMPANIED THEIR NEW FRIEND THROUGH A MAZE OF PASSAGES--FOR THE PALACE WAS VERY BIG--AND THEN THROUGH A HIGH ARCHED PORTAL INTO THE STREETS OF THE CITY
ALL THEY NEED TO DO WAS TO STEP OUT INTO THE STREET THROUGH THE DOOR OF CAP'N BILL'S ROOM AND OPEN THE UMBRELLA
THEY WORE RINGS AND NECKLACES AND BRACELETS AND BROOCHES OF ROSE-GOLD SET WITH PINK GEMS AND ALL FOUR OF THE NEW ARRIVALS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN CARRIED SHARP-POINTED STICKS MADE OF ROSEWOOD FOR WEAPONS
TROT WAS HORRIFIED AND WRUNG HER LITTLE HANDS IN SORE PERPLEXITY FOR THIS WAS A MOST HORRIBLE FATE THAT AWAITED HER DEAR OLD FRIEND
A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
THAT IS WHY I AM THE QUEEN
YES YOU ARE
ILLUSTRATION IN HIS FRIGHT THE BOY SPRANG BACKWARD A STEP AND DROPPED THE UMBRELLA TO THE GROUND AND AS HE DID SO IT TOOK THE FORM OF A COMPLETE ELEPHANT GROWING RAPIDLY TO A MONSTROUS SIZE
DON'T YOU FIND IT HARD WORK TO MEMBER ALL OF YOUR NAME I DON'T TRY TO HE SAID
I'VE ALWAYS FLOWN ABOVE THE LAND SO FAR AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING NEW TO FLY OVER THE OCEAN ALL RIGHT
JUST BEFORE HE STARTED TROT SAID
ANYWHERE
ON THIS JUMP THEY SAW NOTHING BUT A MONSTROUS TURTLE WHICH LAY ASLEEP WITH ITS HEAD AND LEGS DRAWN INTO ITS SHELL
YOU'RE A-MAKIN A SAD MISTAKE FOR WE'RE AS HARMLESS AS DOVES
SHE SAYS IT MAKES HER HEAD ACHE TO PERFORM WITCHCRAFT AND SO SHE SELDOM INDULGES IN IT
THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW SOME UNKNOWN MAN HAD ESCAPED FROM THE PALACE THE NIGHT BEFORE BY MEANS OF THE WALL WHICH HE HAD REACHED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE VERY CHAMBER IN WHICH SHE HAD SLEPT
THE BAND TRIED TO ENLIVEN THEM BY PLAYING THE DEAD MARCH BUT IT WAS NOT A SUCCESS
BUT MRS GRIFFITH HAD HER MIND ON OTHER THINGS AND MERELY TOLD THE GIRL TO TAKE WHAT SHE WANTED FROM THE CUPBOARD AND NOT BOTHER HER
NEVER ON THE EARTH WAS THERE VISIBLE SUCH SPLENDOR AND AS THE LITTLE GIRL WATCHED THE EVER-CHANGING SCENE SHE DECIDED THE SUNSET TRIBE WAS AMPLY JUSTIFIED IN CLAIMING THAT THE WEST WAS THE FAVORED COUNTRY OF THE SUN
BUT I HOPE SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY WILL NOT FALL UPON MY SHOULDERS
TROT AND BUTTON-BRIGHT WITH CAP'N BILL AND ROSALIE THE WITCH WENT TO THE HUMBLE PALACE WHERE THEY HAD A SIMPLE SUPPER OF COARSE FOOD AND SLEPT UPON HARD BEDS
POLYCHROME LISTENED AND THEN TURNED TO THE QUEEN
THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY JUST NOW WHICH PROVED THE ADVENTURERS HAD BEEN A LONG TIME IN PASSING THROUGH THE FOG BANK
WHEN ABOUT FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND THE UMBRELLA BEGAN MOVING ALONG THE COAST TOWARD SMUGGLER'S COVE WHICH IT SOON REACHED
THIS WOULD INDEED BE A SEVERE PUNISHMENT
LOOK OUT--LOOK OUT THERE'S FOLKS ABOUT IT SCREAMED
THERE IS A MOUNTAIN IN THE CENTER OF THE BLUE LAND AND THE ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BLUE GROTTO IS AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN
HERE'S A NICE BLUE CARROT FOR YOU
HE DIDN'T SAY HOW HE WOULD OVERCOME ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES SO THE LITTLE GIRL FEARED THEY WOULD NEVER SEE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA AGAIN
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON I EVER KNEW THAT COULD SCARE OUR BOOLOOROO THEY PASSED ON AND GHIP-GHISIZZLE WHISPERED
WE'LL MANAGE TO TAKE CARE O YOU OH I'M ALL RIGHT ANSWERED TROT WITH FINE COURAGE
AIN'T YOU HUNGRY CHILD YES SAID BUTTON-BRIGHT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO ESCAPE SHE ASKED THE CAPTIVE
THAT'S THE TOWN SAID TROT
SO YOU'LL MIND WHAT HE SAYS NONSENSE SHOUTED INDIGO
AGAIN HE FELL IN A HEAP AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER FOR IT WAS A HIGH WALL AND THE JUMP A DANGEROUS ONE
WON'T WE ALL THUMP WHEN WE LAND WITH A BUMP IF WE DO SAID CAP'N BILL THOUGHTFULLY WE'LL NONE OF US KNOW IT ILLUSTRATION ILLUSTRATION ROSALIE THE WITCH CHAPTER 16
BUT AT PRESENT IT'S PRETTY LATE IN THE DAY AND PHILADELPHIA IS A GOOD WAY OFF
SO BEING TIRED OUT THEY LAID THEMSELVES COMFORTABLY DOWN AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER FELL COSILY ASLEEP
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DIDN'T MARCH THROUGH THE ARCH I DO NOT KNOW FOR NO ONE HAS EVER REFUSED TO DO SO
IF WITH MY GREAT POWER CONFERRED UPON ME BY THE PEOPLE I ALSO POSSESSED GREAT WEALTH I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BE CRUEL AND OVERBEARING
BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO HERE ASKED TOURMALINE
THE BOOLOOROO'S AFRAID OF ME OH THAT'S DIFFERENT SAID JIMFRED
THE BLUE IS AROUND ALL ONE SIDE OF IT AN A PINK SUNSHINE AROUND THE OTHER SIDE
ALL THIS TIME THE SHRILL EXCITED VOICE WAS LOUDLY COMPLAINING BECAUSE THE SAILOR WAS ON HIS FEET AND TROT LOOKED TO SEE WHO WAS MAKING THE PROTEST WHILE CAP'N BILL ROLLED OVER AND GOT ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES SO HE COULD PULL HIS MEAT LEG AND HIS WOODEN LEG INTO AN UPRIGHT POSITION WHICH WASN'T A VERY EASY THING TO DO
BY AND BY THEY PASSED THROUGH A CITY GATE AND THEIR GUIDE SHOWED THEM THE OUTER WALLS WHICH PROTECTED THE CITY FROM THE COUNTRY BEYOND
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE BLUE COUNTRY
THE RESULT WAS THAT THE LANCES OF THE BOOLOOROO'S PEOPLE COULD NOT TOUCH THE PINKIES BUT WERE THRUST ASIDE WITH VIOLENCE AND EITHER BROKEN IN TWO OR SENT HURLING THROUGH THE AIR IN ALL DIRECTIONS
GUESS I'D BETTER SEND FOR HIM AN TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENED SO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS WAS GIVEN THE KEY AND TOLD TO FETCH THE BOOLOOROO FROM THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE
IF WE DON'T WE'LL NEED PLENTY OF MAGIC TO HELP US BACK TO THE PINK COUNTRY
SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE PRETTY YOUNG TO BE TRAVELIN SO FAR FROM HOME AN AMONG STRANGERS
WE'VE TRIED TO BE FRIENDLY AN PEACEABLE AN WE'VE POLIGIZED FOR HURTIN YOU
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PINK COUNTRY WAS LIKE O COURSE HE SAID BUT WE KNEW IT COULDN'T BE WORSE THAN THE BLUE COUNTRY AN WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY STOCK IN THEIR STORIES THAT THE FOG BANK WOULD BE THE DEATH O US PRETTY WET
WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO RAIN SO IT NEED NOT DELAY US AND WHEN A DISAGREEABLE DUTY IS TO BE PERFORMED THE SOONER IT IS ACCOMPLISHED THE BETTER MAY I ASK MA'AM SAID CAP'N BILL ADDRESSING THE WITCH WHY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO MURDER OF US IN THIS COLD-BLOODED WAY I DID NOT DECIDE TO MURDER YOU ANSWERED ROSALIE
CAP'N BILL HAS ONE WOODEN LEG SHE EXPLAINED
SO I THREW IT AWAY
THAT IS HER NAME AND IT IS SUFFICIENT SAID THE WOMAN
BUT I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO TUMBLE OUT OF THE ZODIAC SOME TIME AGO
DON'T KICK YOUR HEELS TROT CRIED THE SAILOR IN A VOICE THAT PROVED HE WAS EXCITED BY HIS NOVEL EXPERIENCE
BUT AS LONG AS YOU WEAR IT NO ONE CAN SEE YOU--NOT EVEN EARTH PEOPLE OH THANK YOU CRIED TROT
THEREFORE WE SHOULD IN HONOR AND JUSTICE DO THEM NO HARM ROSALIE NODDED
IF WE DON'T GET TWISTED ANY WE'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE IT WAS NO DARKER IN THE FOG BANK THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE BLUE COUNTRY
LET ME GO THIS MINUTE OR I'LL--I'LL HAVE YOU PATCHED TWICE DON'T MIND HIM CAP'N SAID TROT BUT FETCH HIM ALONG TO THE FRAME THE BOOLOOROO LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM AND CAP'N BILL GRINNED JOYFULLY AND CAUGHT UP THE KING IN BOTH HIS STRONG ARMS DRAGGING THE STRUGGLING MONARCH OF THE BLUES TO THE FRAME
CAP'N BILL FEELING SURE HE HAD WON THE ARGUMENT WHISPERED TO THE BOY AND GIRL THAT THEY MUST EAT AND GET AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THIS MIGHT PROVE A DANGEROUS COUNTRY FOR THEM TO REMAIN IN
AND FEED MY POETIC BLUE PARROT THAT BARKS LIKE A DOG SAID PRINCESS SAPPHIRE
BEEN TO TOWN HE ASKED
AND THEN HE ADDED GRUMBLINGLY IN TROT'S EAR
YOU THREE MUST FOLLOW ME TO THE PRESENCE OF TOURMALINE
I DID HURRY WHEN I WAS GOING CAP'N BILL BUT ON MY WAY HOME I SAT DOWN HERE TO REST AN WATCH THE GULLS--THE GULLS SEEM AWFUL BUSY TO-DAY CAP'N BILL--AN THEN I FOUND THIS BOY CAP'N BILL LOOKED AT THE BOY CURIOUSLY
AS THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WAS NOW AS MOTIONLESS AS ANY ORDINARY UMBRELLA MIGHT BE BUTTON-BRIGHT FIRST RELEASED THE CATCH AND CLOSED IT UP AFTER WHICH HE UNHOOKED THE CROOKED HANDLE FROM THE ROPE AND ROSE TO HIS FEET
HERE WE DO NOT DIE YOU KNOW
