ANYTHING UD DO--IF TWAS ONLY AN OLD BROOM CUT DOWN TO ME EIGHTH
AND YOU'VE HAD THE PLAGUE-FEVER
WHY DON'T YOU HELP ME GET OUT
HE MUST THINK WHAT HE WAS SAYING
WE HAD TO GIVE UP EVER HAVING ANY MORE MAGIC SO AS TO GET FATHER BACK
YOU SEE THAT DON'T YER DICKIE DID SEE
THEN DICKIE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH AND UNFASTENED THE WINDOW WHICH OPENED LIKE A CUPBOARD DOOR
HE WAS ALMOST ASLEEP WHEN A CRACK LIKE THUNDER BROUGHT HIM STARK STARING AWAKE--THERE WAS A NOISE OF FEET ON THE STAIRS BOOTS A BLUNDERING HURRIED RUSH
THAT'S USEFUL SAID EDRED SCORNFULLY
I DIDN'T MEAN NOTHING OLD CHAP
HAVING SUCCEEDED IN DREAMING ONCE AGAIN THE DREAM WHICH HE HAD SO LONGED TO DREAM DICKIE HARDING LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE DREAM-HOUSE IN DEPTFORD INTO THE DREAM-GARDEN WITH ITS CUT YEW-TREES AND BOX AVENUES AND BOWLING-GREENS AND PERCEIVED WITHOUT DOUBT THAT THIS WAS NO DREAM BUT REAL--AS REAL AS THE OTHER DEPTFORD WHERE HE HAD SOWN ARTISTIC BIRD SEED AND GATHERED MOONFLOWERS AND REAPED THE SILVER SEEDS OF MAGIC FOR IT WAS MAGIC
HIGH-BACKED CHAIRS WITH TAPESTRY SEATS WERE RANGED IN A ROW AGAINST ANOTHER
NESBIT AUTHOR OF THE WOULDBEGOODS THE TREASURE SEEKERS ETC
I SAID
NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME IT'S ALL SQUARE YOU WON'T KEEP A DOWN ON ME FOR IT NOW SHOULD I SAID DICKIE EXASPERATED AND VERY SLEEPY
AS MOULDIERWARP TO THE ARDENS I CAN BUT OWN THAT I AM PROUD OF HIM THE MOULDIERWARP HAD AS WELL AS A GENTLE VOICE A FINER NOSE THAN THE MOULDIWARP HIS FUR WAS MORE EVEN AND HIS CLAWS SHARPER
LIKE AS IF I'D HAD SLEEPY-STUFF--YOU KNOW
AND WE'LL SEE THY GALLEON AND GET OLD SEBASTIAN TO MAKE ME ONE TOO YES SAID DICKIE AS THE BOAT CAME AGAINST THE QUAY
THE GRUEL WAS VERY SWEET AND PLEASANT
WHAT CAN WE DO TO PAY OUT OLD PARROT-NOSE THEN RICHARD FOUND A VOICE AND WORDS
THEY'RE COMING AND THEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HOOFS AND WHEELS AND LORD ARDEN'S JOLLY VOICE SAYING HE MUST HAVE WALKED ON
AT LAST THE BOATS CAME TO A PRETTY LITTLE TOWN AMONG TREES
BUT THOU'ST FOUND THY TONGUE AT LAST--THINE OWN TONGUE NOT THE WANDERING TONGUE THAT HAS WAGGED SO FAST THESE LAST DAYS BUT I THOUGHT I WAS IN THE FRONT ROOM AT DICKIE BEGAN
YOU LAY TO IT WE AS SAID MR BEALE
IT'S BURNED ME FINGER THE MATCH WENT OUT AND BEALE AND DICKIE WENT BACK TO SUPPER IN THE CROWDED GAS-LIT ROOM
YOU'D LIKE THAT NOT ARF SAID DICKIE GETTING UP
BUT IN THE EVENING HE WAS UNDRESSED BY KIND CLEAN HANDS AND WASHED IN A BIG BATH HALF-FULL OF HOT SILVERY WATER WITH SOAP THAT SMELLED LIKE THE TIMBER-YARD AT THE END OF THE STREET
AND HE THOUGHT HOW PLEASANT IT WAS TO BE A TRAMP AND WHAT JOLLY FELLOWS THE TRAMPS WERE
YOU MISS YOUR MOTHER DON'T YOU YUSS SAID DICKIE SADLY
IT'LL COST A LOT--MY VICTUALS I MEAN
THEY WAVED THEIR WHITE PAWS ON THE GRAY-BLUE CURTAIN OF MIST AND BEHOLD THEY WERE NOT THERE ANY MORE AND THE BLUE-GRAY MIST WAS ONLY THE NIGHT'S DARKNESS TURNING TO DAWN AND DICKIE WAS ABLE AGAIN TO FEEL SOLID THINGS--THE FLOOR UNDER HIM HIS HAND ON THE SHARP EDGE OF THE ARMCHAIR AND THE SOFT BREATHING COMFORTABLE WEIGHT OF TRUE ASLEEP AGAINST HIS KNEE
THE BACK SITTING-ROOM WAS A KENNEL FOR THE DOGS WHICH MR BEALE INSTANTLY BEGAN TO COLLECT
I SAY YOU DO LOOK FUNNY DON'T SAID EDRED CROSSLY
TINKLER DEAR TWILL INDEED BE A FAIR SCENE
THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE TREES AND BUSHES DICKIE COULD SEE THE WIDE PARK LIKE A SPREAD SHADOW DOTTED WITH TREES THAT WERE LIKE SHADOWS TOO
YES--AND THERE'S ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS--YES--I RECKON US'LL STOP ON ERE A BIT AND DICKIE WAS VERY GLAD
YOU ORTER GONE A BIT OF THE WAY WITH IM WELL I OFFERED FOR TO GO DIDN'T I BEALE GROWLED BLUNDERED DOWN THE STAIRS AND OUT THROUGH THE WASH-HOUSE AND CAME ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WITH A STABLE LANTERN IN HIS HAND
I DON'T WANT THAT RED'EADED CHAP
BUT I WOULDN'T GO TO TAKE AWAY THE NIPPER'S LITTLE BIT O PLEASURE NOT FOR NO SHILLING I WOULDN'T HE ENDED NOBLY WITH A FOND LOOK AT DICKIE
ELFRIDA DID NOT SEEM VERY ANXIOUS TO TALK EITHER
ONCE THOU'RT HEALED SHE SAID THOU'LT BE FOREVER RUNNING DOWN TO THE DOCKYARD
IT'S BURGLING THAT'S WHAT IT IS YOU'LL A JOLLY SIGHT TOO FOND OF CALLING NAMES SAID BEALE ANXIOUSLY
YOU SEE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BEALE AND NOW
THERE WAS A TORN NEWSPAPER ON THE FLOOR
DICKIE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO
WANT TO PAWN THE RATTLE EH NO SAID DICKIE BUT WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME ON THE SEAL YOU GAVE ME THE PAWNBROKER STARED FROWNED AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
THE NURSE'S HAND IT WAS
LET'S TRAMP UP AND I'LL SHOW IT TO YOU--WHERE WE USED TO LIVE AND WHEN THEY HAD TRAMPED UP AND DICKIE HAD SHOWN MR BEALE THE SAD-FACED LITTLE HOUSE MR BEALE OWNED THAT IT WOULD DO EM A FAIR TREAT
I NEVER KNEW YOU TOOK LIKE IT AFORE FACT IS SAID BEALE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CANDOR IT'S IS CLEVERNESS DOES ME
THAT'S WHERE THE LODGING-HOUSE IS WHERE BEALE AND SO ON OVER AND OVER AGAIN
KNOW WHAT SHE SHOT THE MOON--OLD HURLE MOVED HER
FOR SHE WAS THE ONLY LITTLE GIRL FRIEND HE HAD
IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER THE WEDDING OF MELIA AND MR BEALE THAT DICKIE REMEMBERED THAT TO FIND THE ARDEN TREASURE FOR HIS COUSINS HAD BEEN ONE OF HIS REASONS FOR COMING BACK TO THIS THE NOWADAYS WORLD
COMING NO SAID DICKIE
I'D BEST BE GETTING HOME I WOULDN'T GO OME NOT IF I WAS YOU SAID THE MAN
IT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING AND TO THE MUSIC OF THEIR TWO VOICES DICKIE EDGED ALONG CLOSE TO THE GRAPES AND MELONS HOLDING ON TO THE SHELF ON WHICH THEY LAY SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION BY THE TAP-TAPPING OF HIS CRUTCH
SINCE HE HAD WAKENED OUT OF THAT WONDERFUL DREAM ON PURPOSE TO GO TO GRAVESEND HE MIGHT AS WELL START AT ONCE
THEY SAT ON A HILLOCK AMONG THE THIN HAREBELLS AND WILD THYME AND SWEET LAVENDER-COLORED GIPSY ROSES WITH THEIR EYES FIXED ON THE OPENING IN THE HILLSIDE AND WAITED AND WAITED AND WAITED FOR A VERY LONG TIME
BUT DON'T LET YOUR MIND DWELL ON IT
I DID LIKE YOU MOST AWFULLY EVEN THEN
YOU'D HAVE KNOWN ME A MILE OFF BY MY WHITE LEGS IF I HADN'T COVERED THEM UP WITH THIS ELFRIDA SAID BOTH BOYS AT ONCE
HE PASSED SILENTLY AND SLOWLY BETWEEN THE ROSE-FILLED WINDOW AND THE HEAP OF BANANAS THAT ADORNED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORWAY TURNED THE CORNER THREW HIS ARM OVER HIS CRUTCH AND LEGGED AWAY FOR DEAR LIFE DOWN A SORT OF COVERED ARCADE
YONDER'S THE WELL HE SAID
QUITE SOON NOW HIS PART IN THE ADVENTURE WOULD BEGIN
THE NURSE HAD DROPPED ALL SORTS OF THINGS INTO AN IRON POT WITH THREE LEGS AND HAD SET IT TO BOIL IN THE HOT ASHES
ISN'T OLD BEALE A FUNNY OLD MAN SAID EDRED
THEY COMES DOWN ANDSOMER IF THERE'S A NIPPER
EVEN THE ROMAN SASH INSTEAD OF HAVING STRIPES BLUE AND RED AND GREEN AND BLACK AND YELLOW WAS OF FIVE DIFFERENT SHADES OF WHITE
DICKIE'S HEART WAS BEATING VERY FAST
SOMETIMES IT COMES TO THEM GRADUALLY SO THAT THEY HARDLY KNOW WHEN IT BEGINS AND LEAVES THEM AS GRADUALLY LIKE A DREAM WHEN YOU WAKE AND STRETCH YOURSELF
IT WAS HELPED AND HAD TO BE EATEN AS THEY SAY IN NORFOLK
SHE TOLD HIM HOW HIS FATHER WAS SIR RICHARD--THE KING HAD MADE HIM A KNIGHT ONLY LAST YEAR--AND HOW THIS PLACE WHERE THEY NOW WERE WAS HIS FATHER'S COUNTRY HOUSE
THERE IT'S SPLENDID SAID DICKIE
WE MUST GET A LOCKSMITH SAID LORD ARDEN
COMES OME END O NEXT MONTH
LIKE THEY GIVE ME AT THE ORSPITTLE I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO THINK THAT MARKHAM HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO PUT SLEEPY-STUFF IN THAT BOTTLE OF MILK
AND DO NOT TALK OF IT
THEY HAD SEEN IT IN THE PICTURE
MARKHAM WILL BRING YOU SOME WARM MILK
THAT PART'S EASY AND FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THY WISH NO MAGIC IS NEEDED BUT THE MAGIC OF STEADFAST HEART AND THE PATIENT PURPOSE AND THESE THOU HAST WITHOUT ANY HELPING OR GIVING OF OURS SAID THE COURTLY MOULDIERWARP
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER THING WITH IT TIED ON WITH STRING
STIR YOURSELF MY MAN
THEY WERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER EAGERLY AND ONCE ELFRIDA HALF LOOKED ROUND
IT'S ONLY A DREAM REALLY I SUPPOSE
HIS HEAD FELT AS THOUGH IT WERE GOING TO BURST
HURRY UP CAN'T YOU IT WAS NO GOOD
HE PULLED OUT TINKLER AND THE SEAL AND LAID THEM ON THE HEAP OF SEEDS
IF YOU GO TO RESCUE RICHARD ARDEN THE MOULDIESTWARP SAID YOU MAKE THE GREATEST SACRIFICE OF YOUR LIFE
AND THEN ONE DAY QUITE AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD HIS COUSIN EDRED AND LADY ARDEN HIS AUNT WERE SET FREE FROM THE TOWER AND CAME HOME
IT WAS THE ACCENT OF THE BOY WHO HAD HAD TWO TUTORS AND A BIG GARDEN A PLACE IN THE KING'S WATER-PARTY AND A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BELONG TO A NOBLE HOUSE
TO SHOW US HOW WE ARE TO FIND DEAR DICKIE WHO IS LAME AND KIND
OR PRETEND WE WERE JUST KIDDING YOU WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER EDRED SAID
PERHAPS YOU ONLY DREAMED THAT ABOUT DICKIE BEING SHUT UP SOMEWHERE AND IT'S NOT TRUE
I WILL SAID THE NURSE
GO BACK AND I'LL FASTEN IT ALL UP AGAIN
HIS EARS GREW VERY HOT AND HIS HANDS AND FEET VERY COLD
THE SHRILL THRILL OF THE SKYLARK'S SONG LIKE CANARY BIRDS GOT LOOSE
BUT THERE'S BAD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD--POLICE AND SUCH--AS MIGHT LAY IT UP TO ME AS I TOOK YOU AWAY AGAINST YOUR WILL
A PRETTY BEAST SHE SAID
NO ELFRIDA--CLIMBED UP ON TO THE WINDOW-LEDGE
HE FELT NOW VERY FULLY WHAT HE HAD FELT VAGUELY AND DIMLY AT TALBOT COURT THAT HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON WHO OUGHT TO DO ANYTHING MEAN AND DISHONORABLE SUCH AS BEING A BURGLAR AND CLIMBING IN AT PANTRY WINDOWS
I THINK P'RAPS IT WAS ME WANTING SO TO DREAM IT AGAIN KEP ME AWAKE I DESSEY SAID BEALE PICKING UP A STRAW TO CHEW
THE BITS OF ARMOR OUT OF THE HALL AND THE INDIAN FEATHER HEAD-DRESSES FATHER BROUGHT HOME AND I HAVE FATHER'S SHOOTING-GAITERS AND BROWN PAPER TOPS AND YOU CAN HAVE AUNT EDITH'S ROMAN SASH
THE WINDOWS WERE LOW AND LONG WITH SMALL PANES AND THE LIGHT WAS BROKEN BY UPRIGHT STONE DIVISIONS
COME USE THEM AND WALK DICKIE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS FEET
YOU REMEMBER THE ARMADA--TWENTY YEARS AGO
HE HELPED TO WASH TRUE CLEANED THE KNIVES AND RINSED LETTUCE FOR TEA
THEY'RE LIKE PUTTY NOW
AND HERE'S BEALE PROVIDED FOR AND SETTLED
COULD IT BE THAT SHE HAD DREAMS LIKE HIS AND IN THOSE DREAMS VISITED LATER TIMES WHEN ALL THIS WAS MATTER OF HISTORY
NOT A DAWG
HE RATTLED THEM NOW
DON'T WORRY YOUR LITTLE HEAD
WHAT ARE THEY
MR PARADOS WAS ASKING QUESTIONS AND LITTLE ELFRIDA WAS TRYING TO ANSWER THEM AND DICKIE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GUNPOWDER PLOT HAD NOT HAPPENED Y_ET AND THAT ELFRIDA HAD GIVEN THE WHOLE SHOW AWAY
AN NOW YOU AND ME'LL HAVE A WORD OR TWO PARTICLER AND SETTLE UP ABOUT THIS ERE JOB
COME ON MATE AND DICKIE FOR THE FIRST TIME SLEPT OUT-OF-DOORS
HE LOOKED UNNATURALLY FAT AND AS HE SAT DOWN ON THE MOSS SOMETHING INSIDE THE FRONT OF HIS JACKET MOVED AND WHINED
IT ONLY PAWNS FOR A SHILLIN SAID DICKIE PAGE 37 YOU'RE A KIND FATHER SAID THE LADY
THE CLOTHES THEY WORE WERE CLEAN
LATER SHE MET A MAN WHO HAD BEEN A BURGLAR
AND AT ARDEN DICKIE WAS HAPPY
YOU WILL NEVER TELL YOUR FATHER THIS THE LOW BEAUTIFUL VOICE WENT ON
ELFRIDA WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE ROOM FOR FEAR EDRED SHOULD BE ILL WITH SOMETHING CATCHING
HOW COULD HE GET TO GRAVESEND WITHOUT A CRUTCH
AND NONE HE ADDED SHALL ASK HOW THEY BE SPENT THE LADY FROWNED
AND A BATH WE'LL AVE
NO SUGAR THANK YOU ELFRIDA"--AND THEN SAT DOWN AND HAD TEA AND WAS AS JOLLY AS POSSIBLE
HE WAS GOING TO HELP EDRED AND ELFRIDA TO GET IT
I CAN'T HE SAID
IMAGINE WHAT YOU WOULD FEEL IF YOU HAD LIVED WINGLESS ALL YOUR LIFE AMONG PEOPLE WHO COULD FLY
HE PRESSED HIS THUMB ON THE LATCH AND OPENED THE DOOR VERY SOFTLY
HE SAYS SO DICKIE HAD INDEED MURMURED WORDS TO THIS EFFECT AS POLICEMEN CALL IT WHEN THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT PEOPLE REALLY HAVE SAID
THEN IN THE CASE OF ELFRIDA PETTICOATS AND ROMAN SASH AND JAPANESE WICKERWORK SHOES AND FATHER'S SHOOTING-GAITERS MADE TO LOOK LIKE BOOTS BY BROWN PAPER TOPS
I KNOW'D RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID SUDDENLY AND HOARSELY
SO NOW WE ARE FREE
AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A BATH OF STEAMING WATER BEFORE THE FIREPLACE WHICH WAS IN QUITE ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM SO THAT DICKIE HAD NOT NOTICED THE CANS BEING BROUGHT IN BY A MAID IN A PINK PRINT DRESS AND WHITE CAP AND APRON
I SEEN YOUR SON IN LONDON
AND A CRUTCH--OH DEAR DICKIE SAT UP
THERE'S A KEY AND A CHAIN AND A BOTTOM BOLT
MR BEALE HAD EXPLAINED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL DAY
POOR ELEANOR YOU MUST BE WORN OUT EDWARD SAID THE LADY I WISH WE COULD ADOPT THAT LITTLE BOY
SOMEWHERES WHERE NOBODY CAN'T SAY WHAT YOU UP TO AND MAKE A MOCK OF ME THEY FOUND A PLACE SUCH AS DICKIE DESIRED A WARM SUNNY NEST IN THE HEART OF A GREEN WOOD AND ALL THROUGH THE LONG WARM HOURS OF THE AUTUMN DAY MR BEALE LAY LAZY IN THE SUNSHINE WHILE DICKIE VERY PALE AND DETERMINED SLICED CHIPPED AND PICKED AT THE SOFA LEG WITH THE KNIFE THE GARDENER HAD GIVEN HIM
PERHAPS THIS NEW BOY WHOSE PLACE HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN HAD A REAL MOTHER OF HIS OWN AS NICE AS THAT NICE LADY
BUT THAT WAS A VERY LONG TIME AGO AND DICKIE HAD NEVER SEEN THE RABBITS
WELL YOU AIN'T THE ONLY ONE
IT WAS NOT ONLY JUST BODY-SLEEPINESS
BUT MY OWN DADDY'S DEAD LET'S GO UP ON THE DOWNS SAID ELFRIDA AND SIT DOWN AND YOU TELL US ALL ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO THEY WENT UP AND SAT AMONG THE FURZE BUSHES AND DICKIE TOLD THEM ALL HIS STORY--JUST AS MUCH OF IT AS I HAVE TOLD TO YOU
ONLY TRUE SNEEZED AND SNUFFED AND BLEW AND WENT ON DIGGING
WHICH WAS THE DREAM
BUT THERE'S SEASONS AND THE SEASON THEY CAME OUT OF WAS SUMMER AND THE SEASON YOU'LL GO BACK TO TIS AUTUMN--SO YOU MUST LIVE THE SEVEN MONTHS IN THEIR TIME AND THEN IT'LL BE SUMMER AND YOU'LL MEET THEM AND WHAT ABOUT LORD ARDEN IN THE TOWER
LORD ARDEN'S BOUGHT FATHER'S COTTAGE AN E'S GOIN TO BUILD ON TO IT AND I'M TO AVE ALL THE DAWGS DOWN ERE AND SELL EM THROUGH THE PAPERS LIKE
I DREAMED THAT I WAS LAME
THERE ARE CERTAIN CHILDREN BORN NOW AND THEN--IT DOES NOT OFTEN HAPPEN BUT NOW AND THEN IT DOES--CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT BOUND BY TIME AS OTHER PEOPLE ARE
DICKIE FELT HIMSELF LIFTED AND CAUGHT AT THE WINDOW-SILL WITH HIS HANDS
WHEN DICKIE NEXT SAW THE BOX IT LOOKED AS OLD AS ANY BOX NEED LOOK
THE FRONT BEDROOM WAS FITTED WITH A BENCH FOR DICKIE
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL CRUTCH AND DICKIE SAID SO
YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT WHAT'S YOUR NAME EH DICKIE HARDING GET IT WROTE DOWN THEN
IT HAD MARBLE SEATS BALUSTRADES AND THE DAMP DEWS OF AUTUMN HUNG CHILL ABOUT ITS ALMOST UNLEAFED TREES
I DID DREAM IT HONOR BRIGHT
ABOVE THE BINS WERE DELIGHTFUL LITTLE SQUARE-FRONTED DRAWERS LABELLED RAPE HEMP CANARY MILLET MUSTARD AND SO ON
I WANT TO THAT'S WHAT I SAY SAID THE MAN CHEERFULLY
DICKIE DUG A LITTLE WITH A TROWEL IN THE BLANKET HOUSE
AND NOW HE SAID I MUST GET TO GRAVESEND HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE DISMAL SORDID STREET
BUT HE NEVER GOT THEM SAID
WILL YOU DICKIE DEAR YOU KNOW I WON'T DICKIE ASSURED HER
I CAN'T STAY HERE AND FEEL THAT I'M TURNING YOU AND YOUR FATHER OUT
ARRIVED IN THE COURTYARD DICKIE PROUDLY LED THE WAY AND STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE STONES NEAR THE RUINED ARCH THAT HAD BEEN THE CHAPEL DOOR
IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE FURZE HOUSE
DON'T LIKE ALL THAT WHITE CURTAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF
HE'S MORE YOURS THAN MINE SAID ONE
I CAN'T THINK WITH YOU BLUBBING LIKE THAT I'M NOT SAID ELFRIDA UNTRULY AND SNIFFED WITH SOME INTENSITY
AND NOW THE BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS LIFE OPENED ONCE MORE FOR DICKIE AND HE LEARNED MANY THINGS AND FOUND THE DAYS ALL GOOD AND HAPPY AND ALL THE NIGHTS WHITE AND PEACEFUL IN THE BIG HOUSE AND THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN ON THE SLOPES ABOVE DEPTFORD
HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BREATHE QUIETLY AND HIS HEART BEAT SO LOUDLY THAT HE FELT ALMOST SURE THAT IF ANY PEOPLE WERE AWAKE IN THE HOUSE THEY WOULD HEAR IT EVEN UP-STAIRS IN THEIR BEDS
THEY WERE ON THE ROAD AND THEIR FACES WERE SET TOWARDS LONDON
HE HELD HIS BREATH
ALL RIGHT SAID BEALE ONLY IF IT ALL GOES WRONG IT AIN'T MY FAULT--AN THERE USED TO BE A FOOT-PATH A BIT FURTHER ON
THERE'S A CARRIAGE AWAITING FOR YOU HE STEPPED OUT
SO NOW I'VE GOT ONLY MY OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF
SEEDS O COURSE SAID DICKIE WHO KNEW MORE ABOUT SEEDS NOW THAN HE HAD DONE WHEN HE SAVED THE PARROT SEEDS
ELFRIDA SAW THE WHITENESS ALL ABOUT HER AND LOOKED DOWN ANXIOUSLY AT HER CLOTHES AND EDRED'S WHICH SHE REMEMBERED TO HAVE BEEN OF RATHER ODD COLORS
THEN WITH UNBELIEVABLE QUICKNESS SHE BOLTED AND CHAINED THE DOOR LOCKED IT AND TURNING SAW DICKIE
ONE OF THEM'S SILVER--REAL SILVER--MY GRANDFARVER AD IT WHEN E WAS A LITTLE BOY BUT IF YOU'VE GOT SILVER YOU OUGHTN'T TO BE BEGGING SAID THE LADY SHUTTING UP HER PURSE
LIVES OUT ERE WITH IS LITTLE FRIENDSES HE ADDED AFTER A VIOLENT EFFORT OF IMAGINATION--"IN OLES IN THE GROUND
CUPS OF WINE AND SILVER DISHES OF FRUIT AND CAKES WERE HANDED ROUND
I AM FORBIDDEN TO TELL THEM SAID THE NURSE BUT THOU CANST HELP THEM AND SHALT I SHOULD LIKE THAT SAID DICKIE--"BUT CAN'T I SEE THE WHITE MOULDIWARP I DARE NOT--EVEN I DARE NOT CALL IT AGAIN TO-NIGHT THE NURSE OWNED
IT WAS NOT FOR HIM
HE'S DONE IT ONCE TOO OFTEN AND HE'S GOT STUCK SOME TIME IN HISTORY AND CAN'T GET BACK AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
BUT IT WAS HARD--HARD--HARD
THE DOG AND THE BOY WENT ON ALONG A PASSAGE DOWN STEPS CUT IN THE ROCK THROUGH A ROUGH HEAVY DOOR AND SO INTO THE SMUGGLERS CAVE ITSELF AN ENORMOUS CAVERN AS BIG AS A CHURCH
NOT MUCH I WON'T
AND DICKIE LIFTED THE LATCH OF SMOOTH BROWN SUN-WARMED IRON AND WENT UP THE BRICK PATH AS THE OLD MAN SLOWLY TURNED HIMSELF ABOUT IN THE CHAIR
DO DO DO SO I WILL DEN--DERE AIN'T NO REASON IN GETTING ALL OF A FLUSTER
CLEVER AS A TRAINDAWG E IS--AN ALL OUTER IS OWN EAD
ALL THOU HAST TO DO IS TO FORGET THY DREAM AND TAKE UP THY LIFE HERE--AND BE SLOW TO SPEAK FOR A DAY OR TWO TILL THOU HAST GROWN USED TO THINE OWN PLACE
A BROKEN PALING WAS QUITE CLOSE TO HIM
I COULD A-TOLD YOU WHERE THEY WAS
HE GOT UP-STAIRS VERY QUICKLY ON HANDS AND KNEES WENT STRAIGHT TO THE LOOSE BOARD DISLODGED IT FELT IN THE HOLLOW BELOW
THE FOOD THEY ATE WAS GOOD
DICKIE REMEMBERED HOW LITTLE TRUE HAD CUDDLED UP TO HIM AND NESTLED INSIDE HIS COAT WHEN HE LAY DOWN TO SLEEP UNDER THE NEWSPAPERS AND THE BITS OF SACKING IN LAVENDER TERRACE ROSEMARY LANE
LET ME AVE A SQUINT SAID A DINGY GRAY OLD MAN SITTING APART
THERE WAS A HIGH FOUR-POST BED WITH BLUE SILK CURTAINS AND MORE PILLOWS THAN DICKIE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
WHAT IS IT HE ASKED
WISH TO BE THERE A WEEK BEFORE THEY COME THAT THOU MAYST KNOW THE PLACE AND THE FOLK NOW DICKIE ASKED BUT NOT EAGERLY FOR HE WAS VERY TIRED
AND IT SEEMED QUITE PLAIN TO HIM THAT IF THIS THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM WAS NOT MAGIC THEN THERE NEVER WAS AND NEVER WOULD BE ANY MAGIC TO HAPPEN TO ANY ONE
AND I SHALL SPEAK A WORD TO THEM BOTH IN THE MORNING BUT WHEN EDRED AND ELFRIDA WERE GONE TO BED LORD ARDEN FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT FEEL QUITE SURE OR QUITE SATISFIED
THOU WANTS NO CRUTCH WITH TWO FINE STRAIGHT STRONG LEGS LIKE THOU'S GOT
ALL THOSE GOOD FIELDS AND HAPPY GARDENS ARE BUILT OVER NOW
AND THE QUEER LITTLE ANIMAL DRAWN IN FINE SCRATCHES ON THE SIDE OF THE RATTLE WAS IT SEEMED A CREST
PINCHING LEADS TO TROUBLE
I CAN'T
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WEAR ON YOUR HELMET IN THE HEAT AND PRESS OF THE TOWER NAMENT THE PAWNBROKER EXPLAINED THAT CRESTS NO LONGER LIVE EXCLUSIVELY ON HELMETS BUT ON ALL SORTS OF ODD THINGS
WILL HE BE BEHEADED FOR TREASON DICKIE ASKED
WHAT'S THIS SHE SAID
AN E UPS ON HIS IND LEGS AND TURNS THE ANDLE WITH IS LITTLE TWISTY FRONT PAWSES CLEVER AS A MONKEY AND HOUT E GOES LIKE A HARROW IN A BOW
THE IMAGE OF THAT INCOMPARABLE VIRGIN MAJESTY WHOSE EXAMPLE IS A BEACON FOR ALL TIME TO ALL VIRTUOUS LADIES ILLUSTRATION
BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A ROARING RUSHING SOUND FROM INSIDE THE CAVE AND A FLASH OF SHINY SILVER GLEAMED ACROSS THAT DARK GAP IN THE HILLSIDE
AND AN ELDER-TREE THAT IN THE HOT WEATHER HAD FLAT WHITE FLOWERS ON IT BIG AS TEA-PLATES
AN I LIKE NIPPERS
YOU AIN'T HAD YER TEA YET MY BOY IT WAS THE MOST GLORIOUS TEA DICKIE HAD EVER IMAGINED
THESE WORDS WERE
PRODUCED BY SUZANNE SHELL EMMY AND THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM AT HTTP://WWW.PGDP.NET ILLUSTRATION
DICKIE SAW NO MATTER FOR REGRET
THE STONES FITTED INTO THEIR PLACES LIKE BITS OF A CHINESE PUZZLE
I KNOW NOW IT'S ALL A SILLY DREAM
I DON'T S'POSE MY FATHER'S ALIVE NOW
TO THEM IT WILL BE LIKE A DREAM THAT THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN BUT THE SWANS AND THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICE--AND JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW DICKIE URGED
WE HAVE WROUGHT A CURE GOODY HE SAID
OW'M I TO WHEEL THE BLOOMIN PRAM IF YOU GOES ON LIKE AS IF YOU WAS A BAG OF EELS THEY CAMPED BY A COPSE FOR THE MIDDAY MEAL SAT ON THE GRASS MADE A FIRE OF STICKS AND COOKED HERRINGS IN A FRYING-PAN PRODUCED FROM ONE OF THE KNOBBLY BUNDLES
IT WAS A PAWN-TICKET--"RATTLE
FROM WHAT THEY WERE AT DEPTFORD I SHOULD THINK I DID SAID DICKIE--"AT LEAST IT WASN'T THAT I NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE SO MUCH AS THAT I FELT SOMETHING QUEER
IT MEANS FLOWERS AS COMES UP FRESH EVERY YEAR
THE SECOND MOULDIWARP HE HAD NOT YET MET
SUPPOSE HE GAVE THEM UP--THE PRICELESS POSSESSIONS
THEY COULD PUT A MAN AWAY FOR LESS THAN THAT BUT IT AIN'T AGIN MY WILL SAID DICKIE
A MAN OR A LADY OR SOMEBODY IN THE OUSE
SSH WHERE ARE THEY--THE MAN AND WOMAN EDRED WHISPERED
AFTER BREAKFAST DICKIE WAS MEASURED FOR A CRUTCH--THAT IS TO SAY A BROOM WAS HELD UP BESIDE HIM AND A PIECE CUT OFF ITS HANDLE
AND DID YOU EVER SHOVEL SNOW ON TO HIS HEAD AND THEN RIDE AWAY IN A CARRIAGE DRAWN BY SWANS IT IS YOU CRIED ELFRIDA AND HUGGED HIM
THE BLACK PIGS IN A STY CLOSE TO THE ROAD THEIR BREATHLESS ROOTING AND GRUNTING AND THE SHINY BLACKLEADED CYLINDERS THAT WERE THEIR BODIES
HE TOLD ELFRIDA AFTERWARDS THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE'S DOING
DICKIE DARLING HOW DID YOU HURT YOUR FOOT DICKIE FLUSHED
MONEY'S MORTAL HEAVY AND TRAVELS SLOW
NO ONE DON'T LIVE THERE
THE CARVED BOOKCASES WITH ROWS ON ROWS OF GOLDEN-BEADED BOOKS
HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD--ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LATH AND PLASTER
HE HAD A FEELING VERY QUEER AND VERY STRONG THAT HE DICKIE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO OPEN DOORS FOR THE LETTING IN OF BURGLARS
I AIN'T A-GOIN TO LEAVE YER
TRY SHE SAID AGAIN
YOU NEEDN'T
WELL THERE WARN'T NOTHIN IN IT I DIDEN WANT IT TOOK AWAY WAILED DICKIE
NO GROWN-UP PERSON COULD
MY YOUNG MAN SHALL STICK IT TOGETHER WITH CEMENT THE PAWNBROKER WENT ON AND PUT IT IN A LITTLE BOX
AND YOU MEETS SOLDIERS AND PARTIES IN RED COATS RIDIN ON HORSES WITH SPOTTED DAWGS AND MOTORS AS RUN YOU DOWN AND TAKE YOUR EAD OFF AFORE YOU KNOW YOU'RE DEAD IF YOU DON'T LOOK ALIVE
BUT I BEEN A BEAST ALL THE SAME SAID MR BEALE HELPLESSLY
E AIN'T NO GOOD NO GOOD SAID BEALE
NO HE SAID CAUTIOUSLY WISH I WAS
AND HE SAID NOTHING
YOU CRAWL DOWN IT AND OUTSIDE YOU BE SURE ENOUGH DICKIE WENT TOWARDS THE VOICE AND SURE ENOUGH AS THE VOICE SAID THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE GROUND JUST BIG ENOUGH IT SEEMED FOR HIM TO CRAWL DOWN ON HANDS AND KNEES
AND ELFRIDA IT WAS AND NOT MR TRESHAM LORD MONTEAGLE'S COUSIN WHO HAD GIVEN AWAY THE WHOLE BUSINESS
NOT ARF WELL NOW WE'RE A-GOIN IN THE TRAIN LIKE DOOKS--AN AFTER THAT WE'RE A-GOIN TO AVE A RARE OLD BEANO
THIS PRACTICAL KINDNESS WENT TO DICKIE'S HEART MORE THAN ALL THE KISSES OF THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE FLOWER-SHOP
TO GIVE UP THE HERE AND NOW FOR THE FAR OFF THE ALMOST FORGOTTEN
BEALE DREW HIS COAT SLEEVE ACROSS HIS EYES
YOU'RE KEEN AREN'T YOU RATHER WAS ALL THERE WAS TIME FOR ELFRIDA TO SAY
THE PAWNBROKER LOOKED AT HIM
NOBODY DON'T LIVE ERE MATE SAID MR BEALE
THEN THERE WAS A SOUND OF SHOUTING THE RIVER SUDDENLY GREW ALIVE WITH THE GLITTER OF DRAWN SWORDS THE BUTTERFLY GLITTER OF LADIES WAVED SCARVES AND HANDKERCHIEFS AND A GREAT GILDED BARGE CAME SLOWLY DOWN-STREAM FOLLOWED BY A PROCESSION OF SMALLER CRAFT
THE NURSE HAD SHOWN HIM HOW TO DO ALL THIS
THE PEOPLE ROUND THE CHILDREN PUSHED THEM GENTLY FORWARD
ALL RIGHT HE SAID AT LAST
FOR THE DOG-TRADE PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY AND MR BEALE HAD GROWN KNOWING IN THOROUGHBREEDS AND THE PRIZE BENCH HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT DISTEMPER AND DOGGY FITS AND WHEN YOU SHOULD GIVE AN AILING DOG SAL-VOLATILE AND WHEN YOU SHOULD MERELY GIVE IT LESS TO EAT
RUN ALONG NOW SAID THE JEW I'VE NOTHING MORE FOR YOU TO-DAY DICKIE FLUSHED AND WENT
IT HARDLY SEEMED A PASSAGE AT ALL SO THICK AND LOW HUNG THE CURTAIN OF DUSTY COBWEBS
AND THOSE THOU'ST SPENT MERRYMAKING IN THE KING'S WATER PAGEANT
AND I ADN'T A BEARD THAT TIME LIKE WHAT I'VE GOT NOW WELL THEN SAID DICKIE
TRUE WAS PULLING LIKE MAD AT THE CHAIN
YOU JUST ARST FOR A DRINK AND SORT OF SEE OW THE LAND LAYS
IT'S A DEAR LITTLE BOY SAID THE SLENDER LADY WHO HAD A PALE KIND FACE DARK EYES AND VERY RED LIPS
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME TO TELL YOU EVERYTHINK SILENCE
MR BEALE THE TRAMP WHO HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS
THAT IS HOW LAME PEOPLE FEEL AMONG US WHO CAN WALK AND RUN
E AIN'T FORGOT YOU NOT E SAID DICKIE
AVE YOU BEEN ASLEEP
TURNED ITS CORNER AND FOUND HIMSELF IN A WILDERNESS OF BASKETS AND CARTS AND VEGETABLES THREADED HIS WAY THROUGH THEM IN AND OUT AMONG THE BASKETS OVER FALLEN CABBAGE-LEAVES UNDER HORSES NOSES FOUND A QUIET STREET A STILL QUIETER ARCHWAY PULLED OUT THE KNIFE--HOWEVER HIS ADVENTURE ENDED HE WAS THAT KNIFE TO THE GOOD--AND PREPARED TO CUT THE MONEY OUT OF THE BELT MR BEALE HAD BUCKLED ROUND HIM
SHE POURED WHITE WINE INTO THE GRUEL AND HAVING STIRRED IT WITH A SILVER SPOON FED DICKIE AS ONE FEEDS A BABY BLOWING ON EACH SPOONFUL TO COOL IT
70 SPENT DOGS 4 GRUB 19 TRAM 4 LEG 2
AND A LILAC-TREE WITH BROWN BUDS ON IT
OH THANK YOU SAID DICKIE FERVENTLY
DICKIE WAS CANED ON BOTH HANDS AND KEPT IN
OF COURSE THEY COULD NOT BE REALLY AFFECTIONATE WITH A STRANGER ABOUT
I KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO IF IT WAS ME REMEMBRANCE SHOWED HIM THE FATHER WHO HAD LEANED ON HIS SHOULDER AS THEY WALKED ABOUT THE WINDING WALKS OF THE PLEASANT GARDEN IN OLD DEPTFORD--THE FATHER WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE LITTLE HORSE AND INSISTED THAT HIS TWENTY GOLD PIECES SHOULD BE SPENT AS HE CHOSE
NOW LISTEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE BED AND DICKIE CUDDLED UP AGAINST HER STIFF BODICE
HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN IT TO HIM IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE DICKIE WAS TAKEN TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM
THE WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM
NEW CLOTHES WERE BOUGHT--MORE FURNITURE
NOW MIND YOU DON'T CONTRADICT ANYTHING WOT I SAY TO PEOPLE
IF I HAD I COULD LEND YOU SOME OF HIS CLOTHES
YOU WILL NOT LET ME PLEDGE THE SEAL WITH YOU
IT WAS NOT A BIRD--HE KNEW THAT THE NEXT MOMENT--BUT A BIG DARK CLOAK THAT SOME ONE HAD THROWN OVER HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND THROUGH IT STRONG HANDS WERE HOLDING HIM
BUT IN THE WINTER-TIME BEALE URGED
I READ AN INTERESTING NAR RATAIVE ABOUT A LION THE KING OF BEASTS AND A MOUSE THAT SMALL AND TY MOROUS ANIMAL WHICH IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD IT I WILL NOW PUR SEED TO RELITE YOU'RE A RUM LITTLE KID I DON'T THINK SAID THE MAN
LET'S SPIN FOR IT SAID THE FIRST VOICE AND THERE WAS A HUMMING SOUND ENDING IN A LITTLE TINKLING FALL
I KNOW IT'S NOT MANNERS BUT DICKIE WON'T MIND SHE SAID BEFORE THE WHISPERING BEGAN
THAT YOU DICKIE OWNED THAT IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF A TRAPPED WILD ANIMAL AND TURNED AND FACED A BOY OF HIS OWN AGE A SCHOOLFELLOW--THE ONE IN FACT WHO HAD CHRISTENED HIM DOT-AND-GO-ONE OH WHAT A TURN YOU GIVE ME HE SAID
GENTLEMEN DO IT EVEN HE ADDED WISTFULLY
THE BOX WAS WRAPPED IN A SILK SCARF AND THE WHOLE PACKET PUT INTO A BIG EARTHENWARE JAR WITH A LID AND THE JOIN OF LID AND JAR WAS SMEARED WITH RESIN AND COVERED WITH CLAY
AND IN THE MEANTIME I AM HIS GUARDIAN
HE SAID ARDEN CASTLE WAS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR DICKIE WITH A FACE LIKE THAT
MINE IS TOO
COME NOW
DICKIE HELD HIS BREATH
AND I'LL THEE HE GETTH IT IT WASN'T HIS FAULT SAID DICKIE WRIGGLING EARNESTLY IN HIS HIGH CHAIR
I AIN'T GOIN TO STICK IT ON NEVER NO MORE SAID DICKIE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IT HALF SO WELL IF THOU HADN'T BEEN HERE SHE SAID SMILING
WHEN HE AWOKE HIS EYELIDS NO LONGER FELT HEAVY SO HE OPENED THEM
I WILL NOT WASTE IT SAID DICKIE
THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN THE GAMES THE BOAT-BUILDING THE SOFT CLOTHES THE KIND PEOPLE THE UPLIFTING SENSE THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY
WEH
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
CHEVERING PARK IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE I WOULD HAVE YOU TO KNOW
NOW THE FEVER IS PAST THERE MUST BE A FUMIGATORY
I SEE HIM GROWING IN GRACE AND FAVOR VERSED IN BOOK LEARNING EXPERT IN ALL NOBLE SPORTS AND EXERCISES
I'VE BEEN BEHIND YOU ALL THE WAY EDRED

WHERE'D YOU GET THAT FACE EH
AND ERE--THIS'LL PAY FOR THE BUS HE HELD OUT COPPERS
HE BALANCED HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT BEAT WITH HIS CRUTCH ON THE GROUND AND SHOUTED HI AND HULLO AS LOUD AS HE COULD
THAT WAS THE QUESTION
I HAD TO COME UP TO MAKE SURE HE WAS HERE BUT E AIN'T ERE SAID BEALE
THAT IS THE INN WHERE THEY HAVE THE BEDS WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS WHAT'S ALL THAT THERE DICKIE ASKED POINTING TO THE ODD KNOBBLY BUNDLES OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES TIED ON TO THE PERAMBULATOR'S FRONT
HE DID NOT WANT THE TREASURE
SHALL WE GO THERE WERE LOTS OF SOLDIERS IN THE PICTURE SAID EDRED AND FIGHTING I'M NOT AFRAID OF SOLDIERS SAID ELFRIDA VERY QUICKLY AND YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING EDRED--YOU KNOW YOU AREN'T YOU CAN'T BE OR YOU COULDN'T HAVE COME AFTER ME RIGHT INTO THE CAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
FOR ME DICKIE SAID--"REALLY FOR ME
HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW
TWENTY GOLD PIECES
A REWARD--AND THOU HAST EARNED IT I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT TOO SAID DICKIE
SO DON'T YOU GO SNIVELLING AFORE ANY ONE'S URT YER FARVER
THAT AND THE THOUGHT OF ALL HE OWED TO HIM WHO HAD BEEN LORD OF ARDEN UNTIL HE CAME WITH HIS LAME FOOT AND HIS HEIRSHIP FRETTED HIS SOUL AS RUST FRETS STEEL
WAY TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID THE LOAFER
THEY WERE VERY WHITE THE MOULDIWARPS OUTLINED DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE GRAY BLUENESS AND THE MOULDIWARP HE HAD SEEN IN THAT WONDERFUL ADVENTURE IN THE FAR COUNTRY SMILED AS WELL AS A MOLE CAN AND SAID THOU'RT A FAIR SPRIG OF DE OLD TREE MUSTER DICKIE SO E BE IN THE THICK SPEECH OF THE PEASANT PEOPLE ROUND ABOUT TALBOT HOUSE WHERE DICKIE HAD ONCE BEEN A LITTLE BURGLAR
YOU'LL AVE TO TRAIN IT
DO THIS FOR US AND ON OUR HEARTS WE SWORE WE'LL NEVER ASK YOU FOR ANYTHING MORE I DON'T SEE THAT IT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN MINE SAID EDRED AND IT OUGHT TO BE SWEAR NOT SWORE I DON'T THINK IT IS
THE SUN'S JUST GOING IT WAS OVER TREES MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANYTHING DICKIE HAD EVER SEEN FOR THEY WERE NOW IN A COUNTRY ROAD WITH GREEN HEDGES AND GREEN GRASS GROWING BESIDE IT IN WHICH LITTLE ROUND-FACED FLOWERS GREW--DAISIES THEY WERE--EVEN DICKIE KNEW THAT
AND NEXT MOMENT HE WAS THROUGH THE WINDOW AND JOE WAS LAYING HIM IN A LONG HAMPER HALF-FILLED WITH STRAW THAT STOOD WAITING
BIDE WHERE YOU BE LAD BIDE STILL
AND DICKIE UNTIED THE LEATHERN STRING AND POURED OUT ON TO THE POLISHED LONG TABLE WHAT THE BAG HELD
DICKIE THOUGHT OF THAT AND ALMOST ONLY OF THAT IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED
HELPED TO DRY THE TEA-THINGS AND TO FOLD THE WASHING WHEN MRS BEALE BROUGHT IT IN OUT OF THE YARD IN DRY SWEET ARMFULS OF WHITE FOLDS
SO HE CAME TO GRAVESEND AND THE COMMON LODGING-HOUSE AND A WEARY SAD AND VERY ANXIOUS MAN ROSE UP FROM HIS PLACE BY THE FIRE WHEN THE CLICKETY-CLACK OF THE CRUTCH SOUNDED ON THE THRESHOLD
HE WAS NOT SHUT IN A ROOM BUT IN A BOX
COME AND LOOK WHAT TREASURE
HE WENT SLOWLY BECAUSE HE WAS LAME
BUT IT WAS NOT ROOFED WITH TILE OR LEAD AS THE REST OF THE CASTLE WAS
YES SAID EDRED SIMPLY
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP THOU CANST GATHER SUCH FLOWERS AS ARE LEFT IN THE GARDEN TO MAKE A NOSEGAY FOR THY MOTHER'S ROOM
GOT ANY CHINK I LOST IT SAID DICKIE
MY FOOT'S A BIT BLISTERED I THINK
THE LADY'S HOUSE WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANYTHING HE HAD EVER IMAGINED--YET NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN CERTAIN THINGS THAT HE ALMOST IMAGINED THAT HE REMEMBERED
BUT E'S MY DADDY ALL THE SAME OH COME ON SAID MR BEALE IMPATIENTLY
IT WAS A PERFECT DAY
THE BOYS AT SCHOOL MADE GAME OF IT--THEY HAD GOT USED TO THE CRUTCH--AND THAT WAS WORSE THAN BEING CALLED OLD DOT-AND-GO-ONE WHICH WAS WHAT DICKIE HAD GOT USED TO--SO USED THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE A PET NAME
AND LORD ARDEN THOUGHT THAT THE CHILDREN MUST BE RIGHT
THEY'D NEVER LET YOU LOOSE AGAIN
A CHAP'S OWN MOTHER MIGHT HAVE PERHAPS--BUT PERHAPS NOT TOO
THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE
EDRED FLUSHED CRIMSON AND A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH THE COMPANY
AND THEN YOUR FATHER CAN BUY BACK THE OLD LANDS AND BUILD THE NEW COTTAGES AND MEND UP ARDEN CASTLE AND MAKE IT LIKE IT USED TO BE OH LET'S SAID ELFRIDA WITH ENTHUSIASM
IT IS AS THOUGH SOME WICKED GIANT HAD TAKEN A BIG BRUSH FULL OF YELLOW OCHRE PAINT AND ANOTHER FULL OF MUD COLOR AND HAD PAINTED OUT THE GREEN IN STREAKS OF DULL YELLOW AND FILTHY BROWN
DICKIE HIS HEAD ON HER SHOULDER WAS FOR ONE WILD MOMENT TEMPTED TO TELL HER EVERYTHING--THE WHOLE STORY FROM BEGINNING TO END
BUT SHE WAS ALSO QUITE TRUTHFUL AND WHEN EDRED SAID IN AN ASHAMED MUFFLED VOICE IS IT ALL RIGHT DO YOU THINK THE BEST SHE COULD FIND BY WAY OF ANSWER WAS I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT POETRY
THAT SETTLES IT SAID THE SECOND VOICE--"HERE AND WHEN THREE'S A GOOD NUMBER THEN EVERYTHING WAS VERY QUIET AND SLEEP WRAPPED DICKIE LIKE A SOFT CLOAK
I DUNNO WHAT IT IS HE SAID MAKES ME ANKER SO AFTER THE ROAD
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS THE DREAM AND WHICH IS REAL--BUT YOU KNOW YES SAID THE OLD NURSE I KNOW
IT WAS JUST LIKE A PLAY AT THE GREENWICH THEATRE DICKIE THOUGHT
DICKIE AND TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL WERE GONE AND ONLY THE EMPTY RING OF MOON-SEEDS LAY ON THE SAND
WHEN SHALL I SEE THE OTHER MOULDIWARP HE ASKED TO KEEP UP THE CONVERSATION--"THE ONE ON OUR SHIELD OF ARMS YOU MEAN THE MOULDIESTWARP SAID THE MOULDIER AS I WILL NOW CALL HIM FOR SHORT
HE HAD BROUGHT HIS COUSINS HERE--HE MUST GET THEM BACK SAFELY
AND JUST AS HE WAS THINKING THIS A TWIG CRACKED SHARPLY IN THE HEDGE
IF YOU SO MUCH AS SQUEAK IT'LL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU HELP SHOUTED DICKIE INSTANTLY
DICKIE LEARNS MANY THINGS 178 VIII
OH ALL ABOUT DICKIE ANSWERED VAGUELY
FIRE AWAY CAN'T YOU ELFRIDA FIRED AWAY AND THE NEXT MOMENT IT WAS PLAIN THAT ELFRIDA'S POETRY WAS MORE POTENT THAN EDRED'S
BUT THE LANDLORD FROWNED ANXIOUSLY AS HE WENT PAST THE HOUSE
IT WASN'T
DICKIE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE BEALE RUN UP THE BRICK PATH AND THROW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES EXCLAIMING FATHER IT IS I--YOUR ERRING BUT REPENTANT SON
FOR NOW HE WAS NEAR ARDEN CASTLE AND COULD SEE IT ANY TIME THAT HE CHOSE TO WALK A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YARDS AND LOOK DOWN
2 A-GOIN TO STICK IT ON NO MORE
I DON'T WANT TO BE
WHEN THE MIST CLEARED DICKIE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE HOUSE WITH MR PARADOS THE NURSE AND THE SERVANTS FOR THE EARL AND COUNTESS OF ARDEN EDRED AND ELFRIDA WERE LODGED IN THE TOWER OF LONDON ON A CHARGE OF HIGH TREASON
YES IF HE COULD HE WOULD
AGAINST THE EARTH SPIRITS AND THE THREE HUNDRED YEARS SHE SAID
BUT WE'RE A LONG-LIVED STOCK--P'RAPS E'S ALL RIGHT
I WANT TO FIND DICKIE I DON'T WANT TO DRESS UP EITHER SAID EDRED
THAT WAS ALL DICKIE HEARD FOR HE THOUGHT IT POLITE TO GO AWAY
AND SET THEM IN ORDER IN FAIR WATER
THE SPANISH ARMADA WHAT OTHER ASKED THE SHIP-BUILDER
I DIDN'T NEVER TAKE YOU ALONG OF ME CAUSE I FANCIED YOU LIKE WHAT I SAID
AND T'OTHER ONE I LET IM GO CHEAP FOR FOURTEEN BOB TO A BLACK CLERGYMAN--BLACK AS YOUR HAT HE WAS FROM FOREIGN PARTS
BUT THIS TIME DICKIE DID NOT REPLY THAT HE WAS NOT PARTICULAR INSTEAD HE SAID OH THERE I WANT TO GO THERE FEELING QUITE SURE THAT WHOEVER OWNED THAT VOICE WOULD KNOW AS WELL AS HE OR EVEN BETTER WHERE THERE WAS AND HOW TO GET TO IT
NO THEY AREN'T REALLY
BUT EDRED UNEXPECTEDLY ANSWERED I DON'T KNOW THE THREE CHILDREN WERE SITTING IN THE WINDOW OF THE GATE-TOWER LOOKING DOWN ON THE GREEN TURF OF THE CASTLE YARD
NEVER MIND LACING UP OF YOUR BOOTS
DICKIE HARDLY MOVED AT ALL AND THE CHIPS THAT FELL FROM HIS WORK FELL MORE SOFTLY THAN THE TWIGS AND ACORNS THAT DROPPED NOW AND THEN FROM SOME HIGH BOUGH
FATHER--DID YOU PROMISE I PROMISED IF THOU WAST A GOOD LAD AND BIDDABLE AND CONSTANT AT THY BOOK AND THY MANLY EXERCISES TO GIVE THEE SO SOON AS THOU SHOULD'ST HAVE LEARNED TO RIDE HIM A LITTLE HORSE SAID DICKIE BREATHLESSLY
BUT I SHALL BE HAPPY THERE
AN AS I GETS MY LIVING BY THE SWEAT OF CHARITABLE LADIES AN GENTS IT DON'T DO NO HARM TO AVE A LITTLE NIPPER ALONGSIDE
NOW LIE STILL FOR YOUR LIFE SAID THE SECOND VOICE
AND IT WAS RATHER DARK
AND JUMPED OUT
THEN DOES IT HURT YOU--WALKING NOT LIKE IT DID FORE I WENT TO THE ORSPITTLE
THE WHITE CURTAINS HAD NOW NO SORDID SECRETS TO KEEP--AND WHEN THE LANDLORD CALLED FOR THE RENT MR BEALE WAS ABLE TO ASK HIM TO STEP IN--INTO A COMFORTABLE ROOM WITH A HORSEHAIR SOFA AND A BIG WORN EASY-CHAIR A CARPET FOUR OLD MAHOGANY CHAIRS AND A TABLE WITH A CLEAN BLUE-AND-RED CHECKED CLOTH ON IT
AND THE THING EDRED COULDN'T DO WAS TO MAKE POETRY HOWEVER BAD
OH JOY
NURSE HAVE I GOT A MOTHER SHE HUGGED HIM
IT WAS ALL GOOD ALL
ONLY ABOUT THE FACE HE TOLD HIMSELF NOT THE WAY SHE'S GOT UP
HE STROLLED UP TO THE COTTAGE TO SEE
IF YOU STIR A INCH I'LL LICK YOU TILL YOU CAN'T STAND
THE SWAN ROSE
AND BEALE WAS A NEW MAN A MAN THAT DICKIE HAD MADE
COULD THIS MAN WHOSE HAIR WAS ONLY JUST TOUCHED WITH GRAY BE HUNDREDS OF YEARS OLD
THOU'RT A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES MASTER RICHARD HE SAID
DICKIE WAS SURE OF IT NOW
I SHALL WAKE WHEN I REACH THE GROUND DICKIE TOLD HIMSELF AND THEN I SHALL KNOW IT'S ALL ONLY A DREAM A SILLY DREAM BUT HE NEVER REACHED THE GROUND
SHE WAS NOT KIND TO HIM
BUT MY QUESTION REMAINS UNANSWERED I WANT SAID DICKIE TO FIND THE LOST TREASURE OF ARDEN SO THAT THE OLD CASTLE CAN BE BUILT UP AGAIN AND THE OLD LANDS BOUGHT BACK AND THE OLD COTTAGES MADE PRETTY AND GOOD TO LIVE IN
I OUGHT TO HAVE CUT THE STRING IN THE TRAIN AND TOLD THE GUARD--HE'S A FRIEND OF THE GARDENER'S HE SAID BUT I WAS ASLEEP
HE AND SHE HAVE KIDNAPPED DICKIE HOPING TO GET HIM TO SIGN A PAPER PROMISING TO PAY THEM MONEY FOR GIVING HIM THE LETTER WHICH TELLS HOW HE IS HEIR TO ARDEN
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS I PACKED THEM OFF TO BED
DON'T YOU GO TURNING AGIN ME HE SAID
HE AND THE LADY HAD BREAKFAST TOGETHER IN A BIG ROOM WITH LONG WINDOWS THAT THE SUN SHONE IN AT AND OUTSIDE A GREEN GARDEN
THE LADY'S ARMS WERE ROUND HIM IN AN INSTANT
E WAS A FINE SET-UP CHAP TO HEAR THE NAME OF ARDEN ON BEALE'S LIPS GAVE DICKIE A VERY ODD HALF-PLEASANT HALF-FRIGHTENED FEELING
IF THOU'S SO PLEASED TO LEARN AS SEBASTIAN IS TO TEACH THEN HE'LL BE AS QUICK TO TEACH AS THOU TO LEARN
BUT THE SHIRT HE HAD ON WAS LIKE THE SHIRT HE HAD SLEPT IN AT THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE
THE THING THAT RUSTLED A LONG LENGTH THROUGH DEAD LEAVES IN A BEECH COPPICE AND WAS IT APPEARED A REAL LIVE SNAKE--ALL THESE MADE THE JOURNEY A ROYAL PROGRESS TO DICKIE OF DEPTFORD
WELL I NEVER DID--NEVER SAID ANOTHER VOICE
MY FATHER'S THERE WAITING FOR ME
THE FACT WAS THE LIFE THEY WERE LEADING WAS SO HAPPY IN ITSELF THAT THEY NEEDED NO MAGIC TO MAKE THEM CONTENTED
IT'S THE NIPPER HE SAID
DICKIE FEELING VERY SMALL AND BEWILDERED AMONG ALL THESE DANGEROUS HAPPENINGS FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY THE ARM
WHAT SHOULD IT FRIGHTEN ME FOR WELL IT'S LIKE THIS SAID MR BEALE A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
THERE'S THE OLE PRAM UP-STAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM AS LIVELY AS EVER SHE WAS--ONLY WANTS A LITTLE OF PAINT TO BE FIT FOR A DOOK SHE DOES
AND NOW THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE VOICES AND THE MAGIC WERE OVER AND DICKIE AWOKE THRILLED TO FEEL HOW CLEVERLY HE HAD MANAGED EVERYTHING MOVED HIS LEGS IN THE BED REJOICING THAT HE WAS NO LONGER LAME
AND YOU MADE IT YOURSELF TRUTH TO TELL I BEGAN IT LONG SINCE IN THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS SAID HIS FRIEND AND NOW TIS DONE AND TIS THINE
AND HIS TUTOR WAS MR PARADOS CALLED PARROT-NOSE FOR SHORT BY HIS DISRESPECTFUL PUPILS
NEVER YOU MIND WHETHER IT'S SILLY OR NOT SAID BEALE
THE LITTLE NIPPER HE SAID
BUT THEY SEEMED VERY POOR AND VERY LITTLE OF THEM WHEN THEY WERE DUMPED DOWN IN THE FRONT ROOM
BUT IT WAS ONLY TRUE STANDING UP TO RECEIVE COMPANY

THE NEW LIFE WAS FAIRLY STARTED
AND IF THE RIGHT BIT OF MAGIC COMES THEIR WAY THOSE CHILDREN HAVE THE POWER TO GO BACK AND FORTH IN TIME JUST AS OTHER CHILDREN GO BACK AND FORTH IN SPACE--THE SPACE OF A ROOM A PLAYING-FIELD OR A GARDEN ALLEY
SLEEPINESS FILLED IT LIKE A THICK FOG
YOU MAY WONDER WHY SINCE GOING TO THE BEAUTIFUL OTHER WORLD TOOK NO TIME AND WAS SO EASY DICKIE DID NOT DO IT EVERY NIGHT OR EVEN AT ODD TIMES DURING THE DAY
AND THE REMNANT WAS SCATTERED AND DRIVEN NORTHWARD AND SOME WERE WRECKED ON THE ROCKS AND SOME OUR SHIPS MET AND DEALT WITH AND SOME POOR FEW MADE SHIFT TO GET BACK ACROSS THE SEA TRAILING HOME LIKE WOUNDED MALLARDS TO TELL THE KING THEIR MASTER WHAT THE LORD HAD DONE FOR ENGLAND HOW LONG AGO WAS IT ALL THIS DICKIE ASKED
THE STOUT GENTLEMAN ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AND SLAPPED A STOUT LEG WITH A STOUT HAND
FOR NEITHER OF THESE VOICES WAS STRANGE TO HIM
IT IS A TREASURE BURIED IN ARDEN CASTLE BY THE SEA WHICH IS THEIR HOME
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER SAW A FLOWER JUST LIKE THEM COME TO THINK OF IT SAID THE PAWNBROKER WHO LIVED IN A NEAT VILLA AT BROCKLEY AND WENT IN FOR GARDENING IN A GENTLEMANLY YOU-NEEDN'T-SUPPOSE-I-CAN'T-AFFORD-A-REAL-GARDENER-IF-I-LIKE SORT OF WAY
AND THE FRIEND WHO HELPED HIM WAS AN ENEMY
BUT HOW HAD ELFRIDA KNOWN
DID'ST THOU FIND THY FRIEND IN THY DREAMS DICKIE HUGGED HER
WE DON'T BELONG HERE
AND AS IF ANYBODY COULD EAT AN EGG-CUP ANYHOW
AS WELL ER AS ANYBODY AND SHE'S USED TO THE DAWGS
CHUCK IT I SAY
WILL YOU TAKE IT INSTEAD OF THE MONEY THE PAWNBROKER TURNED THE BOX OVER IN HIS HANDS WHILE KINDNESS AND HONESTY STRUGGLED FIERCELY WITHIN HIM AGAINST THE HABITS OF A BUSINESS LIFE
THE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH PEOPLE DRESSED IN COSTUMES OF ALL COUNTRIES AND ALL AGES--CHINAMEN INDIANS CRUSADERS IN ARMOR POWDERED LADIES DOUBLETED GENTLEMEN CAVALIERS IN CURLS TURKS IN TURBANS ARABS MONKS ABBESSES JESTERS GRANDEES WITH RUFFS ROUND THEIR NECKS AND SAVAGES WITH KILTS OF THATCH
BUT IF IT WERE TRUE HOW SPLENDID
AND HE ATE AS MUCH AS HE WANTED TO EAT AND WHEN THAT WAS DONE HE PUT THE REST IN HIS POCKET AND CURLED UP COMFORTABLY IN THE STRAW FOR THERE WAS STILL QUITE A LOT LEFT OF WHAT ORDINARY PEOPLE CONSIDER NIGHT AND ALSO THERE WAS QUITE A LOT LEFT OF THE SLEEPINESS WITH WHICH HE HAD GONE TO BED AT THE END OF THE WONDERFUL DAY
WE'RE ALL RIGHT AND JOLLY AS WE ARE
THE GALLEY WAS DECKED WITH FRESH FLOWERS PAGE 102 HIS MAJESTY AND THE QUEEN THE LITTLE COUSINS WHISPERED AS THE STATE BARGE WENT BY
I CAN'T ELP WHAT I DREAMS CAN I HE SAID
I OUGHT TO GO HE TOLD HIMSELF
THE SHARP FURZE-SPIKES PRICKED HIS NOSE AND PAWS BUT TRUE WAS NOT THE DOG TO BE STOPPED BY LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN ROSEMARY TERRACE THE WORDS POLICE-COURT ARE VERY ALARMING INDEED
SO NOW WE'RE BLOOMIN TOFFS AN I'LL GET A PAIR OF REACH-ME-DOWNS THIS VERY BLOOMIN NIGHT
AND OLD SEBASTIAN TOLD ME EVERY ONE OUGHT TO DO SOME DUTY TO HIS COUNTRY OR HE WASN'T WORTH HIS MEAT AND ALE
I CANNOT REPAY YOUR KINDNESS HE SAID THOUGH SOME DAY I WILL REPAY YOUR SILVER
I AIN'T TICED YOU AWAY
WE SHALL CATCH HIM UP ALL RIGHT THEN THE SOUND OF WHEELS AND HOOFS DIED AWAY AND HARD HANDS PULLED HIM TO HIS FEET AND THRUST THE CRUTCH UNDER HIS ARM
THE THREE CHILDREN HUGGED EACH OTHER AND THEN TURNED TO THE MOULDIWARP
LAY UP FOR A RAINY DAY EH
AND LET THY DREAMS BE OF THE LIFE TO COME COMPARED TO WHICH ALL LIVES ON EARTH ARE ONLY DREAMS
AND WHAT PRICE THAT THERE ROOM YOU WAS TALKIN ABOUT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LIFE
THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES TO FEAST THEM ON THE BIG LIGHT TAPESTRIED ROOM
NO SQUIRRELS OR BIRDS CAME THAT DAY TO LIGHTEN DICKIE'S SOLITUDE BUT TRUE WAS MORE TO HIM THAN MANY BIRDS OR SQUIRRELS
ONLY I SHOULDN'T A DONE FEAR YOU'D BREAK YOUR PRECIOUS NECKS OF COURSE THE CHILDREN WERE DESPERATELY ANXIOUS TO OPEN UP THE BRICKWORK AND LET THE STREAM COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY
I WASN'T UNGRATEFUL I WASN'T--I HAD TO GO BUT HIS EYES IMPLORED
AT ABOUT THE THIRTIETH DO PLEASE
THEN THE MAN AND THE CHILD WENT IN AND BROUGHT OUT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND CHAIRS AND LAID BLANKETS OVER THEM TO AIR IN THE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT
EDRED REMEMBERED THE KNIFE HE HAD BROUGHT
THE CHAP NEXT DOOR TOLD ME
YOU OUT WITH IT IN THAT DREAM SAID DICKIE I WASN'T LAME THINK OF THAT NOW SAID BEALE ADMIRINGLY
DID YOU EVER DREAM OF FIRE CARRIAGES AND FIRE-BOATS AND RICHARD EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS NOT A BABY THAT HE KNEW ALL ABOUT RAILWAYS AND STEAMBOATS AND THE TRIUMPHS OF CIVILIZATION
IT MIGHT TURN IM UP SEEING ME SO SUDDEN
DOWN YOU SETS ON THEM STONES AND HOFF WITH IT
I ALMOST THINK I REMEMBER HE SAID
HE'S WAITING IN THE DREAM AND I WANT TO GET BACK TO HIM
THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
FOR HE HAD BUSINESS IN HAND
NOT SO DUSTY SAID THE MAN
MR BEALE THE TRAMP AND HOUSEBREAKER
HE SIMPLY COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN FLY
STOKES COMPANY COPYRIGHT 1909 BY E
HE MOVED THE DOG AWOKE AND DICKIE FELT ITS SOFT NOSE NUZZLED INTO HIS HAND
THERE WAS NO SLEEP IN THAT HOUSE THAT NIGHT
IN WITH YOU SAID THE MOULDIWARP
HE DISMISSED THE IDEA
NO CADGING I SHOULD OPE YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT SAID BEALE VIRTUOUSLY
I SHALL FEEL LIKE HERE WARD WHEN HE DRESSED IN THE POTTER'S CLOTHES AND WENT TO SEE KING WILLIAM HE SPOKE IN THE BOOK VOICE
THAT'S WHAT I SAY BUT HE SIGHED AS HE SAID IT AND HE FILLED HIS PIPE IN A THOUGHTFUL SILENCE
AND THE WALL WAS HUNG WITH PICTURES DONE IN NEEDLEWORK--TAPESTRY IN FACT THOUGH DICKIE DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WAS ITS NAME
HE LAY FACE DOWNWARD ON THE ROAD AND TURNED UP HIS BOOT PAGE 25 IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU SAID DICKIE BUT WHAT CALL YOU GOT TO DO IT
THE GAYEST COLORS OF THE RAINBOW AMID THE AGUE ABLE GREEN OF FRESH LEAVES
A SHOUT OF PRIDE AND TRIUMPH FROM THE ARDEN MEN
AND THINK WHAT EDRED DID FOR ME IN THIS VERY CAVE
YOU KNOW DREAMS IS QUEER THINGS SAID THE WOMAN
29 AND HE MADE OUT BEFORE HE RUBBED THE CHALK OFF THE STONE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY-NINE SHILLINGS AND SEVENTY WAS ABOUT TWO POUNDS--AND THAT WAS MORE THAN DICKIE HAD EVER HAD OR BEALE EITHER FOR MANY A LONG YEAR
THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THICK YEARS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SHE SAID
AND WHILE HE SAT MAKING IT FAR AWAY IN LONDON A RESPECTABLE-LOOKING MAN WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN REGENT STREET AMONG THE SHOPPERS AND THE MOTORS AND CARRIAGES WITH A FLUFFY LITTLE WHITE DOG UNDER EACH ARM
OH WHAT A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEE DICKIE CRIED
HE TOOK HIS CLAY PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH TO SAY WHAT'S UP MATEY
EXCEPT
NOR YET THAT REDHEADED CHAP WOT YOU NEVER SEE HE LOOKED DOWN AT THE SMALL EARNEST FACE TURNED UP TO HIS OWN
EDRED HAD STUCK THE CANDLE IN THE SAND
NOW HE WOULD SEE EDRED AND ELFRIDA AGAIN AND HELP THEM TO FIND THE HIDDEN TREASURE AS HE HAD ONCE HELPED THEM TO FIND THEIR FATHER
DICKIE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT TO WAIT
GOING HOME 208 IX
THIS MAKES IT EIGHTEEN YEARS TO MY RECKONING IT WAS 1906 IN MY DREAM SAID DICKIE--"I MEAN IN MY FEVER IN FEVER SEBASTIAN SAID FOLK TRAVEL FAR
IT WAS THE BIG PRUNING-KNIFE OUT OF THE DRAWER IN THE HALL
YES--BUT BEALE
YOU CAN LOOK ABOUT YOU JUST AS WELL A-SITTIN DOWN HE ADDED LAYING THE CRUTCH ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE PERAMBULATOR
AND WHEN HE WOKE NEXT DAY IT WAS ALL TRUE
THOU'RT WEAK YET FROM THE FEVER
ABRAMS E'LL BE THERE MONDAY
IT TOOK DICKIE A LONG TIME TO THINK OUT ALL THIS CLEARLY AND WITH NO MISTAKES
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND SAID DICKIE
E AIN'T NO CLASS SAID DICKIE FIRMLY
THE MAN SLAPPED HIS LEG GENTLY
AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS WENT BY AND NOTHING HAPPENED AND THAT IS THE HAPPIEST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ANY ONE WHO IS ALREADY HAPPY
HE MIGHT BE ANYWHERE WHERE HE DIDN'T WISH TO BE--HE MIGHT BE ANY ONE WHOM HE DID NOT WISH TO BE
IF IT'S A DREAM HE SAID SLOWLY I'VE HAD ENOUGH
I DON'T KNOW AS EVER I FELT OF ANYTHINK QUITE AS SOFT WITHOUT IT WAS THE GEESE AS ANGS UP ALONG THE BROADWAY CHRISTMAS-TIME WHY THE BED'S MADE OF GOOSE-FEATHERS SHE SAID AND DICKIE WAS DELIGHTED BY THE COINCIDENCE
IT WAS A DAMP NIGHT AND SMELLED OF EARTH AND DEAD LEAVES
YOU'RE A-GOIN TO BE A GENTLEMAN YOU ARE--AN I'LL HAVE TO TAKE TO THE ROAD BY MESELF AND BE A POOR BEAST OF A CADGER AGAIN
IF THAT AIN'T A FAIR TREAT
I'VE AD MY LESSON YOU CADGED IT THEN SAID DICKIE
I'M NOT GOIN TO DO THINGS WOT'S WRONG--LOW DIRTY TRICKS--SO I AIN'T
HE WAS ANXIOUS IN FACT ABOUT THE DOGS
WHETHER HE WAS LORD OF ARDEN OR NO IT WAS HE AND NO OTHER WHO HAD RESTORED THE FALLEN FORTUNES OF THAT NOBLE HOUSE
I'D RATHER TALK ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS IF YOU DON'T MIND THEN THE THREE WERE SENT OUT TO PLAY AND DICKIE WAS SHOWN THE CASTLE RUINS WHILE LORD ARDEN AND LADY TALBOT WALKED UP AND DOWN ON THE DAISIED GRASS AND TALKED FOR A LONG TIME
HE CAME BEHIND HER AND PUT HIS ARM ROUND HER AS SHE WAS DUSTING THE MANTELPIECE
I WANT TO GET ON WITH THE STORY
TIRED ASKED MR BEALE PRESENTLY
READ IT AGAIN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
STILL HE MUST SAY SOMETHING SO HE SAID ARE THERE MORE VERSES NO SAID ELFRIDA
YOU SEE I MUST TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT THE KIND OF BOY DICKIE WAS AND THE KIND OF WAY HE LIVED OR YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND HIS ADVENTURES
IT WAS IN THE COURTYARD WALL THE COURTYARD THAT WAS NOW A SMOOTH GRASS LAWN AND NOT THE ROUGH DAISIED GRASS PLOT DOTTED WITH HEAPS OF BROKEN STONE AND MASONRY THAT THEY WERE USED TO SEE
YOU CAN KEEP TO THE GRASS THE DEWY GRASS FELT PLEASANTLY COOL AND CLEAN TO DICKIE'S TIRED LITTLE FOOT AND WHEN THEY CROSSED THE ROAD WHERE A WATER-CART HAD DRIPPED IT WAS DELICIOUS TO FEEL THE COOL MUD SQUEEZE UP BETWEEN YOUR TOES
THEY CLATTERED OFF--THEY WERE IN THEIR ARMOR NOW--AND DICKIE KNELT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT ON SCRATCHING WITH THE NAIL
OH BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SAID DICKIE LETTING THE SMOOTH SHAPES SLIDE THROUGH HIS FINGERS
AN A FARVER AND MUVVER AN ALL
I AIN'T DONE NOTHING WRONG WRITIN WHAT YOU TELLED ME NO MY BOY SAID THE MAN YOU AIN'T DONE NO WRONG
AND NOBODY EXCEPT PERHAPS ELFRIDA EVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT HAD COST EDRED TO GO THAT NIGHT THROUGH THE DARK AND RESCUE HIS COUSIN
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOTHING THERE THAT ANY ONE WOULD WANT TO BUY ESPECIALLY NOW THE RABBIT-HUTCH WAS GONE
THEY SEE HOW INCREDIBLY BLACK BLACK CAN BE AND THAT THERE MAY BE A WHITENESS TRANSCENDING ALL THE WHITEST DREAMS IN THE WORLD YOU'RE A RUM LITTLE CHAP WAS WHAT THE PAWNBROKER SAID BUT I LIKE YOUR PLUCK
WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ON BEFORE AS YOU COULD
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING SAID EDRED AGAIN
HE KNEW THEM BOTH ONLY TOO WELL
THERE WAS A LOOSE BOARD IN HIS ROOM WHERE THE MAN SAW TO THE GAS
AND SEE WHAT I'VE MADE THEE WHILE THOU'ST BEEN LAZYING IN BED--A REAL ENGLISH SHIP OF WAR HE LAID DOWN THE AUGER HE HELD AND WENT INTO A LOW ROUGH SHED AND NEXT MOMENT CAME OUT WITH A LITTLE SHIP IN HIS HAND--A PERFECT MODEL OF THE STRANGE HIGH-BUILT SHIPS DICKIE COULD SEE ON THE RIVER
AS HE WENT HE THOUGHT MANY THINGS AND ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT WAS THAT THE MEMORIES OF KING JAMES'S TIME HAD GROWN DIM AND DISTANT--HE LOOKED DOWN ON ARDEN CASTLE AND LOVED IT AND FELT THAT HE ASKED NO BETTER THAN TO LIVE THERE ALL HIS LIFE WITH HIS COUSINS AND THEIR FATHER AND THAT AFTER ALL THE MAGIC OF A DREAM-LIFE WAS NOT NEEDED WHEN LIFE ITSELF WAS SO GOOD AND HAPPY
AND IN THE CASE OF EDRED LEGS CASED IN ARMOR THAT LOOKED LIKE CRICKET PADS ENDING IN JOINTED FOOT-COVERINGS THAT LOOKED LIKE CHRYSALISES
HE TOUCHED THE GROUND WITH BOTH FEET FELT THE FLOOR FIRM AND EVEN UNDER THEM--AS FIRM AND EVEN UNDER THE ONE FOOT AS UNDER THE OTHER
AND BESIDES I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO FIND IM GONE
I SEE IM MAKE IT SAID BEALE FROWNING A LITTLE
AND HE JUDGED THAT MR ROSENBERG WAS A KIND MAN OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO SPEAK SO TO HIM
MEMBER WHAT I SAYS TO YOU IN THE WINTER-TIME THAT NIGHT MR FULLER LOOKED IN FOR HIS BIT O RENT--ABOUT ME GETTIN OF THE FIDGETS IN MY LEGS
DICKIE DREW HIM DOWN A SIDE STREET AND HELD OUT THE SILVER
CLEVER I CALL IT IT'S A MEAN TRICK SAID DICKIE WHEN BEALE TOLD HIM OF THE LOSS OF THE DOG
I COULD DO IT ODD TIMES
WELL THEY SHOULD NOT BE UNHAPPY
AND ONE GENTLEMAN VERY FINE INDEED APPEARED TO BE HIS UNCLE AND A MOST CHARMING LADY IN BLUE AND SILVER SEEMED TO BE HIS AUNT AND A VERY JOLLY LITTLE BOY AND GIRL WHO SAT BY HIM AND TALKED MERRILY ALL THE WHILE WERE HIS LITTLE COUSINS
THEY HAD WOOLEN SOCKS OVER THEIR BOOTS WHICH MADE THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOUND NO LOUDER THAN THOSE OF PADDED PUSSY-FEET
THEY GOT THERE FIRST
THEN THE SOFT RUSTLE-PAD DIED AWAY AND IT WAS PERFECTLY QUIET PERFECTLY DARK
ALAS
TRUE IN FACT WAS THE GREATEST COMFORT TO HIM
AND I MEANT TO PROVIDE FOR HIM MYSELF
TRUE HIMSELF NOW GROWN LARGE AND THICK OF COAT SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE A FRIEND GAMBOLLED ROUND HER DREADFUL BOOTS SNIFFED AT HER WITHERED HAND
NOT AZACKLY WILD--WITH A CIRCUS E WAS
THERE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE MORE ROOM IN THIS NEW LIFE THAN IN THE OLD ONE AND MORE TIME
COULD IT BE THAT SOME ONE WAS TRYING TO GET IN TO HELP HIM
BUT IN HIS SOUL HE WAS GLAD BECAUSE THE SOUL IS GREATER THAN THE HEART AND KNOWS GREATER THINGS
IT SAID BRISKLY NOW THEN WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TO I AIN'T PARTICULAR SAID DICKIE WHO SUPPOSED HIMSELF TO BE LISTENING TO AN OFFER OF A CHOICE OF POLICE-STATIONS
NO ONE CAN ADVISE YOU
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT THE SUN SHOT LONG GOLDEN BEAMS THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE HEDGE
YOU CUT THROUGH THE COPSE AND CATER ACROSS THE ELEVEN-ACRE MEDDER AND BEAR ALONG TO THE LEFT BY THE HEDGE AN IT BRINGS YOU OUT UNDER ARDEN KNOLL WHERE MY OLD MAN'S PLACE IS SO THEY CUT AND CATERED AND BORE ALONG AND CAME OUT UNDER ARDEN KNOLL AND THERE WAS A COTTAGE WITH A VERY NEAT GARDEN FULL OF GAY FLOWERS AND A BRICK PATHWAY LEADING FROM THE WOODEN GATE TO THE FRONT DOOR
THREE OR FOUR FACES LOOKED DOWN AT DICKIE PAGE 70 AND HE SLEPT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
BUT TRUE ONLY SHOOK HIMSELF AND WENT ON DIGGING
AND YOU'LL COME AN AVE A LOOK AT US SOMETIMES AND WHAT ABOUT AMELIA SAID DICKIE AND THE LITTLE ONES WELL I DID THINK SAID BEALE RUBBING HIS NOSE THOUGHTFULLY OF ASKING MELIA TO COME DOWN ERE ALONG O THE DAWGS
HAD HE DROPPED IT SOMEWHERE
EH YOU BE A GENTLEMAN YOU BE SAID THE MOULDIWARP SO'S E--SO THERE'S TWO OF YE SURE ENOUGH IT WAS VERY ODD TO SEE AND HEAR THESE WHITE MOLES TALKING LIKE REAL PEOPLE AND LOOKING LIKE FIGURES ON A MAGIC-LANTERN SCREEN
IT SPREAD OUT IN A LAKE WIDER AND WIDER
EDRED'S FATHER AND MRS HONEYSETT AGREED THAT EDRED HAD DONE IT IN THE DELIRIUM OF A FEVER BROUGHT ON BY HIS ANXIETY ABOUT HIS FRIEND AND PLAYMATE
NOT LIKELY
YES YES IT WAS A VERY NICE DINNER WITH COLD GOOSEBERRY PASTRY AS WELL AS THE STEAK AND VEGETABLES
WELL SAID MR BEALE STRIKING A MATCH TO LOOK AT IT
YOU'RE MORE HIS THAN I AM SAID THE OTHER
A SHOUT OF FURY WENT UP FROM THE ENEMY
AND WAS TOLD
THREE MONTHS AGO IT WAS MUM
I WISH I WAS CLEVERER
ALL THE FURNITURE WAS HEAVILY BUILT OF WOOD HEAVILY CARVED
BUT QUITE QUICKLY HE ROUSED HIMSELF
ELFRIDA WAS DIFFERENT SOMEHOW
YOU SHALL GO TO SCHOOL WITH EDRED AND BE BROUGHT UP LIKE MY VERY OWN SON AND LIKE LORD ARDEN'S VERY OWN SON DICKIE LIVED AT THE HOUSE IN ARDEN CASTLE AND GREW TO LOVE IT MORE AND MORE
A REG'LER WASH ALL OVER--THIS VERY NIGHT
SO NEITHER HE NOR YOU WILL BE MUCH SURPRISED
DICKIE AND ELFRIDA PLAYED BALL AND THEY PLAYED HIDE-AND-SEEK AND THEY RAN RACES
THE AIR TASTES GOOD DON'T IT
NO--I KNOW I AIN'T
AND FAR FROM BEING ASHAMED OF THEIR ACTS THEY WERE BUBBLING OVER WITH MERRIMENT AND DELIGHT AT THEIR OWN CLEVERNESS
IT WOULD BE A GREAT TREAT TO ME IF LORD ARDEN WOULD ALLOW ME TO ASSIST IN THE SEARCH FOR IT THERE'S NO SEARCH NOW SAID ELFRIDA BECAUSE IT'S FOUND
THE UNSELFISH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION OF THE MAN HE HAD DISPLACED THE LOVE OF HIS LITTLE COUSINS THE DEVOTION OF BEALE THE FACT THAT HE WAS LORD OF ARDEN AND WOULD SOON BE LORD OF ALL THE OLD ACRES--THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NOW HE WOULD LEARN ALL HE CHOSE TO LEARN AND HOLD IN HIS HAND SOME DAY THE DESTINIES OF THESE VILLAGE FOLK ALL LOYAL TO THE NAME OF ARDEN THE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT HE COULD BE AND DO--ALL THESE THINGS YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM HAPPY
BURY IT AND LIE DOWN ON THE SPOT WHERE IT'S BURIED AND THEN WHEN YOU GET BACK INTO THE OTHER DREAM THE KIND THICK EARTH WILL HAVE HID YOUR SECRET AND YOU CAN DIG IT UP AGAIN
TIS ONLY ME--OLD MOULDIWARP OF ARDEN
AND WHEN ALL THIS WAS OVER ELFRIDA AND EDRED WANTED DICKIE TO COME BACK WITH THEM TO THEIR OWN TIME
I'VE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH SAID DICKIE AND BEGAN TO LAY OUT THE MOON-SEEDS ON THE SMOOTH SAND
AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS THINKING THINKING
SUCH A LONG TIME THAT WHEN HE DID WAKE UP THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY NEED TO CUT THE STRING OF THE HAMPER
HEAVEN FORBID THAT ONE OF THY RACE SHOULD FAIL A FRIEND
GENTLEMEN THERE ALL HAS DIFFERENT THINGS--PATTERNS LIKE
DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS WENT BY AND IT WAS AUTUMN AND THE APPLES WERE RIPE ON THE TREES AND THE GRAPES RIPE ON THE GARDEN WALLS AND TRELLISES
YOU'LL BE FAIR KNOCKED
WON'T YOU TELL US SOMETHING PLAIN AND STRAIGHTFORWARD I WILL SAID THE MOULDIERWARP RATHER SHORTLY
GOT THE UMP MATE ASKED BEALE WITH HIS MOUTH FULL
YOU DON'T LOOK UP TO MUCH HE SAID
NEVER MIND ME
DICKIE HARDING DICKIE ARDEN I SHOULD A-SAID IF YOU'D ASKED ME SAID THE OLD MAN
THE GREEN HEDGE THE COWS LOOKING OVER THEM
E LISTENS AN E LOOKS AND E DOESN'T EAR NOR SEE NOBODY
IF YOU ASK ME HOW THEY KNEW ABOUT THE CAVES WHICH NONE OF THE COUNTRY PEOPLE SEEMED TO KNOW OF I CAN ONLY ANSWER THAT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU AIN'T YOU JUST LAY LOW TILL WE COMES OUT WITH THE
BUT FATHER--BEALE--WHO HAD BEEN KIND WHOM DICKIE LOVED
THE THIRD YOUNG LADY AND MR ROSENBERG WERE ENGAGED IN ANIMATED EXPLANATIONS WITH A FAIR YOUNG GENTLEMAN ABOUT A BASKET OF ROSES THAT HAD BEEN ORDERED AND HAD NOT BEEN SENT
ONE DOES NOT TRAMP THE COUNTRY FOR A MONTH AT DICKIE'S AGE WITHOUT LEARNING SOMETHING ABOUT SEEDS
WELL GO
MILES AND MILES AND MILES OF THEM AND NOT A GREEN THING TO BE SEEN EXCEPT THE CABBAGES IN THE GREENGROCERS SHOPS AND HERE AND THERE SOME POOR TRAILS OF CREEPING-JENNY DROOPING FROM A DIRTY WINDOW-SILL
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT
THEN THOU CANST SPEAK WITH THEM
AND HE SOLD BOTH THE DOGS
GOOD-BYE HE SAID
THERE WERE WHISPERS--TWO SMALL AND SOFT VOICES
NO ONE KNOWS YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY
HE LIVED AND LEARNED AND FELT MORE AND MORE THAT THIS WAS THE LIFE TO WHICH HE REALLY BELONGED
TWAS IN THE YEAR OF GRACE 1588 AND WE ARE NOW IN THE YEAR 1606
THERE'S A BLUE MUG IN THE WASH-HOUSE WINDOW-LEDGE SAID THE OLD MAN
HIS AUNT AND UNCLE AND HIS TWO COUSINS WERE IN THE TOWER AND GLOOM HUNG OVER ARDEN HOUSE IN SOHO LIKE A BLACK THUNDER-CLOUD OVER A MOUNTAIN
AND HE RAN WITH HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER'S HAND IN HIS
A FEW POOR LITTLE PINK AND YELLOW FLOWERS SHOWED STUNTED AMONG THE GREEN WHERE HE HAD SOWED THE ARTISTIC BIRD SEED
HER MOTHER SAYS SHE HATH RUN WILD TOO LONG SO DICKIE HAD LESSONS ALONE WITH HIS DETESTED TUTOR AND HIS RELIEF FROM THE PANIC FEAR OF THE MORNING RAISED HIS SPIRITS TO A DEGREE THAT UNFORTUNATELY FOUND VENT IN WHAT WAS FOR HIM EXTREME NAUGHTINESS
PLEASE DADDY SHE CRIED WE'VE FOUND THE TREASURE
THEN YOU TAKE THE FIRST TO THE RIGHT AND THE FIRST TO THE LEFT AND YOU'LL GET A BLUE BUS AS'LL TAKE YOU TO THE ELEPHANT THAT'S A BIT OF THE WAY
YES CERTAINLY SAID LORD ARDEN WHEN THE WHISPERING WAS OVER
YOU COME LONGER ME AND BE MY LITTLE UN AND I'LL BE YOUR DADDY AND A BETTER DAD I LAY NOR IF I'D BEEN BORN SO
FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING RICH AND POOR IS AS GREAT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING WARM AND COLD
THE FATHER OF EDRED AND ELFRIDA IS LORD ARDEN NOW
AND IT ISN'T EVERY ONE WHO WOULD OWN THAT MIND YOU I KNOW IT ISN'T SAID DICKIE
NOW YOUNG MAN SAID A STERN VOICE THAT WAS NOT A LADY'S JUST YOU TELL US HOW YOU CAME HERE AND WHO PUT YOU UP TO IT I GOT IN SAID DICKIE FEEBLY THROUGH THE BUTLER'S PANTRY WINDOW AND AS HE SAID IT HE WONDERED HOW HE HAD KNOWN THAT IT WAS THE BUTLER'S PANTRY
AIN'T I YOU AVE THAT SAID DICKIE
AND THIS IS ALL A DREAM SAID DICKIE AND I MUST WAKE UP BUT HE COULDN'T WAKE UP
WHAT IS THIS PLACE GRAVESEND THOU KNOWEST THAT SAID THE LITTLE COUSINS OR HADST THOU FORGOTTEN THAT TOO IN THY FEVER GRAVESEND DICKIE REPEATED IN QUITE A CHANGED VOICE
SO THEN THEY HAD DINNER WHEN THE OLD MAN HAD SET DOWN THE FRYING-PAN EXPRESSLY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH DICKIE SAYING SO THIS IS THE LAD YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
ONLY HOWLS AND RATS LIVES IN RUINS DID ANY ONE EVER LIVE IN IT I SHOULDN'T WONDER SAID MR BEALE INDIFFERENTLY
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS HE ENDED PENSIVELY BUT SOMEHOW IT ALWAYS LEADS TO TROUBLE DICKIE PICKED UP SEVEN STRAWS FROM AMONG THE STUBBLE AND IDLY PLAITED THEM TOGETHER
THE MAN WHO STOLE THE CHILD TOOK IT TO A WOMAN IN DEPTFORD AND GAVE IT IN CHARGE TO HER TO NURSE
YOU COME ON YOUR OWN FREE WISH EH OH YES CAN YOU WRITE YES SAID DICKIE IF I GOT A PEN I GOT A PENCIL--HOLD ON A BIT HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A NEW ENVELOPE A NEW SHEET OF PAPER AND A NEW PENCIL READY SHARPENED BY MACHINERY
WHAT IS IT DICKIE ASKED
SHE WAS A CAREFUL HOUSEWIFE AND TWENTY GOLD PIECES WERE A LARGE SUM
A TALL LADY IN WHITE CARRYING A LAMP SWEPT DOWN THE STAIRS AND CAUGHT AT A MAN WHO SPRANG INTO BEING OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE LAMPLIGHT
AND AT THAT TOUCH A MOST ODD FEELING CAME TO DICKIE--THE LAST FEELING HE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED--A FEELING OF PRIDE MIXED WITH A FEELING OF SHAME
TO LET THE MAN IN WHAT MAN I DUNNO THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR OF THEM SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN PINK
ONE MIGHT AS WELL TRY
AT LAST HE SPOKE
HOW ODD SAID HE TO DREAM ALL THAT--WEEKS AND WEEKS IN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ONE LITTLE NIGHT
HE STOOD THERE ON HIS ONE USEFUL FOOT CLINGING TO THE EDGE OF THE DOOR AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOMETHING TOUCHED HIM THAT HE KNEW THAT MR BEALE AND THE OTHER MEN WERE CREEPING THROUGH THE DOOR THAT HE HAD OPENED
THIS LED TO HERE WARD AND DICKIE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF THAT HERO IN FULL DETAIL BUT THE LADY SAID AFTER BREAKFAST AND NOW IT WAS TIME FOR OUR BATH
SO IT IS HE SAID AND IT'S A BEAUTY TOO LET ALONE ANYTHING ELSE ISN'T HE SAID DICKIE TOUCHED BY THIS PRAISE OF HIS TREASURED TINKLER
I DIDN'T ARST TO COME ERE DID I NO YOU LITTLE THIEF STOW THAT SAID DICKIE AND AFTER A QUICK GLANCE AT HIS SET LIPS SHE SAID WELL NEXT DOOR TO ANYHOW
THERE WERE HOUSES ALL ABOUT--LITTLE HOUSES WITH LIGHTS IN SOME OF THE WINDOWS
THEN SHE PUT HIM INTO THE SOFT WARM BED THAT WAS LIKE A GIANT'S PILLOW TUCKED HIM UP AND KISSED HIM
COME TO PAWN THE RATTLE DICKIE LAUGHED
THEY'RE MOONFLOWERS SAID DICKIE AND I WANT TO PAWN THEM AND THEN GET SOMETHING ELSE OUT WITH THE MONEY GOT THE TICKET SAID THE GENTLEMAN CLEVERLY SEEING THAT HE MEANT GET OUT OF PAWN YES SAID DICKIE
TRUE GAVE A BOUND THAT JERKED THE CHAIN OUT OF EDRED'S HAND AND LEAPED UPON THE DARK THING LICKING IT WHINING AND UTTERING LITTLE DOG MOANS OF PURE LOVE AND JOY
AND I DO HOPE I AM NOT CONFUSING YOU
AND THEY DARE NOT LET RICHARD GO FOR FEAR OF PUNISHMENT
YOU SHAN'T ASK HIM ANY MORE QUESTIONS TO-NIGHT
SOME ONE ELSE HAD DONE THAT AND THE LID OF THE BASKET WAS OPEN AND THREE OR FOUR FACES LOOKED DOWN AT DICKIE AND A GIRL'S VOICE SAID WHY IT'S A LITTLE BOY
LOOK ERE SAID DICKIE DESPERATELY
THE DOGS WERE GOOD AND QUIET AND NO KEEPER DISTURBED THEIR REST OR THEIR MASTERS
WHAT YOU THINK
DICKIE WAS TIRED
I SAY WHAT'LL YOU DO I DON'T KNOW SAID DICKIE TURNING AWAY FROM THE VAN WHICH HAD ABRUPTLY BECOME UNIMPORTANT
AND AGAIN THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM AND AT EACH OTHER
I WILL TEACH THEE ALL THOU CANST LEARN BUT NOT ALL IN ONE WHILE
THERE WERE SMALL GRUBBY DAFFODILS IN IT AND DIRTY-FACED LITTLE PRIMROSES AND AN ARBOR BESIDE THE WATER-BUTT BARE AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR BUT STILL A REAL ARBOR
AND HE HAD CARRIED OUT HIS PART OF IT PERFECTLY
WILL YOU GIVE ME THE FARE FOR THE SEAL THE PAWNBROKER HESITATED AND LOOKED HARD AT HIM
IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE RED-WHISKERED MAN AND PRESENTLY FROM A DITCH ANOTHER MAN CAME
LUCKY WE'VE GOT OUR THICK COATS ON IT WAS QUITE EASY FOR DICKIE TO GET INTO THE HOUSE JUST AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE AND TO GO ALONG THE PASSAGE AND OPEN THE FRONT DOOR FOR MR BEALE WHO WALKED IN AS BOLD AS BRASS
BUT AS THEY WENT ON THROUGH THE FURZE BUSHES DICKIE PERCEIVED THAT MR BEALE WAS GROWING MORE AND MORE SILENT AND UNEASY
THE FIRST STEP WAS HIS LAST
WE GOT ALL OUR COURTIN TO DO NOW
YOU GO TO BED RICHARD NOT ME SAID DICKIE OF DEPTFORD FIRMLY
THE EXCITEMENT OF ALL THESE HAPPENINGS HAD BROUGHT A PINK FLUSH TO HIS FACE AND WHEN THE DOCTOR IN A FULL BLACK ROBE AND BLACK STOCKINGS AND A POINTED HAT STOOD BY HIS BEDSIDE AND FELT HIS PULSE THE DOCTOR HAD TO OWN THAT DICKIE WAS ALMOST WELL
THE BED ESPECIALLY LOOKED FAR FROM ITS BEST--A MERE HEAP OF LOOSE IRON
EDRED NEEDN'T BE IN IT IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO
SHUT YOUR MUG OR I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT FOR DON'T FATHER SAID DICKIE AND SAID IT ALL THE MORE FOR THAT THREAT
THAT WAS HARD WASN'T IT
I'VE FOUND THE WAY BACK HE SAID
NO YOU MUST TELL ME THAT IN THE MORNING
I WILL NOT PRETEND THAT HE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED
HIS EYELIDS FELT SO HEAVY THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO LIFT THEM EVEN WHEN A VOICE SPOKE QUITE NEAR HIM
THEN HE WAS DRAGGED BEHIND A HEDGE AND HELD THERE WHILE TWO VOICES WHISPERED ABOVE HIM
BUT IN THE DREAM
THE STALK'S LIKE A LITTLE TREE SAID DICKIE
BUT ALSO HE WANTED TO LEARN SOME TRADE THAT HE COULD TEACH BEALE AT DEPTFORD AND HE KNEW QUITE AS SURELY AS ANY MASTER CRAFTSMAN COULD HAVE KNOWN IT THAT NOTHING WHICH REQUIRED DELICATE HANDLING SUCH AS WOOD-CARVING OR THE MAKING OF TOY BOATS COULD EVER BE MASTERED BY BEALE
IT IS A DREAM SAID DICKIE TO HIMSELF BUT IF THEY'VE BEEN MADE TO JUMP OUT TO PUNISH THEM FOR GETTING EVEN WITH OLD PARROT-NOSE OR ANYTHING I'LL JUMP TOO HE RUSHED PAST THE NURSE PAST HER VOICE AND THE OTHER VOICE THAT WAS TALKING WITH HERS MADE ONE BOUND TO THE WINDOW SET HIS KNEE ON IT STOOD UP AND JUMPED
HE WILL DO FOR YOU WHEN HE IS OF AGE ALL THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE
DON'T YOU LET ANY ONE TAKE IT AWAY
THERE TOO WERE EDRED AND ELFRIDA
NOW SHE LIFTED THE JAR INTO THE HOLE AND TOGETHER THEY FILLED THE HOLE WITH EARTH TREADING IT IN WITH THEIR FEET
IF YOU THINK THERE ARE NOT SO MANY SHADES OF WHITE TRY TO PAPER A ROOM WITH WHITE PAPER AND GET IT AT FIVE DIFFERENT SHOPS
IT UD SAVE FOURPENCE
AND THEN FIRST MINUTE I GETS ERE YOU SETS ON TO ME
BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY PLEASE PLEASE FORGIVE ME FATHER SAID DICKIE VERY MUCH ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
I ALLUS BEEN KIND TO YOU--YOU CAN'T SAY I AIN'T MR BEALE WAS CONFUSED BY THE TWO DESIRES WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CONFESS ANYTHING TRUTHFULLY--THE DESIRE TO TELL THE WORST OF ONESELF AND THE DESIRE TO DO FULL JUSTICE TO ONESELF AT THE SAME TIME
AND WHEN HE HAD WAITED A LITTLE LONGER IT SEEMED SIMPLY SILLY TO BE WAITING AT ALL
I CAN'T HELP IT I TELL YOU
NURSE A CRACK OF LIGHT SPLIT AND OPENED BETWEEN TWO PANELS THEY SLID BACK AND BETWEEN THEM THE NURSE CAME TO HIM--THE NURSE WITH THE RUFF AND THE FRILLED CAP AND THE KIND WRINKLED FACE
WE AIN'T NO CALL TO TAKE THE ROAD CEPT FOR A PLEASURE TRIP
BEFORE TEA WAS OVER THERE WAS A SOUND OF HORSES HOOFS AND CARRIAGE WHEELS IN THE COURTYARD
AND SO AT LAST DICKIE WENT TO BED HIS WEARY BRAIN FULL OF NEW THINGS MORE DREAM-LIKE THAN ANY DREAMS HE HAD EVER HAD
PERHAPS DICKIE WAS LYING BOUND HIDDEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FURZE BUSH
PEOPLE CAME RUSHING PAST HIM
IT'S A GOOD YARN--GOOD AS HERE WARD VERY NEAR BEALE LAY BACK ON THE DRY STUBBLE HIS PIPE BETWEEN HIS TEETH
THEY BOUGHT A TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS AND A KITCHEN FENDER WITH A ROUND STEEL MOON--ONLY IT WAS VERY RUSTY--AND A HAND-BOWL FOR THE SINK AND A SMALL ZINC BATH TO WASH YOUR SHIRT IN SAID MR BEALE
AND DICKIE ANSWERED SOON AS EVER YOU LIKE'S WHAT I SAY
NOT ARF
COULDN'T GET IM AWAY DICKIE WAS VERY POLITE TO THE LANDLORD AT WHOM IN UNHAPPIER DAYS HE HAD SOMETIMES MADE FACES AND WHEN THE LANDLORD WENT HE HAD SIX OF THEIR SHILLINGS AND THEY HAD THE KEY
SOME OLD LADY TOLD THE OLD MAN IT UD BRING US LUCK
IT WASN'T IN HIM ANY MORE THAN WINGS ARE ON YOU
OUR FAMILY'S AS OLD AS KING ALFRED STOW IT I SAY SAID BEALE MORE FIERCELY STILL
THAT IS HOW EDRED AND ELFRIDA FOUND IT
EDWARD YOU SHAN'T
YOU BEST DREAM THAT EVERY NIGHT
E'S GOT A SILVER TOY IDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE--IT ONLY POPS FOR A BOB--AND D'YOU THINK E'LL TELL ME WHERE IT'S STOWED
IT WAS TOO HARD
IT WAS TOO HARD
EDRED SAW AS THE DOG DRAGGED HIM CLOSE TO THE HOLE THAT IT WAS A LARGE ONE THOUGH ONLY PART OF IT HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
AND TO-MORROW IT IS THE MASQUE IN SIR THOMAS'S PARK
HE STOOPED TO PEER IN HIS FOOT SLIPPED ON THE EDGE AND HE FELL RIGHT INTO IT THE DOG DRAGGING ALL THE TIME
I HAD FORGOTTEN HE SAID SLOWLY
THEY MOVED IN A VERY ODD WAY AND THEN BEGAN TO GO ROUND AND ROUND LIKE TOPS
WILL YOU GO ME
I DUNNO OO MADE IT AN I DON'T CARE BUT THAT WAS MADE BY A WORKMAN AS KNOW'D HIS TRADE
YOU MEAN YOU WILL SAID DICKIE EAGERLY
IT IS A MOONFLOWER OF COURSE HE SAID PAGE 13 UNTIL HE HAD FOUND THAT TICKET HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
HE WAS GLAD WHEN THE GENTLEMAN WENT AWAY
BUT A MAN WHO IS HAPPY IN HIS HOME DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE IT
WHAT'S UP BEALE ASKED TRYING TO TURN ON THE NARROW SEAT AND LOOK UP WHICH HE COULDN'T DO
A WOOD-PIGEON SWEPT RUSTLING WINGS ACROSS THE GLADE WHERE HE SAT AND ONCE A SQUIRREL RAN RIGHT ALONG A BOUGH TO LOOK DOWN AT HIM AND CHATTER THICKENING ITS TAIL AS A CAT DOES HERS WHEN SHE IS ANGRY
BUT I WILL ONLY STAY A MONTH HE TOLD HIMSELF A MONTH HERE AND A MONTH THERE THAT WILL KEEP THINGS EVEN
NO ONE CAN HELP YOU
IT WAS WORTH HAVING LIVED FOR
SECRETS YOU KNOW--HONORABLE SECRETS
BUT THE MOONFLOWER--HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE MORE LOOK AT THAT
HER WRINKLED FACE WAS ALIGHT WITH LOVE AND TENDERNESS
YOU CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MARRIED PEOPLE
THEN HE BRUSHED THE STONE DUST FROM HIS HANDS AND STOOD UP
SHE WILL HAVE A THOUSAND CHANCES TO BE GOOD AND NOBLE
THAT'S WHY I'M RATHER SET ON THE OUSE
NO!--YOU AIN'T
WHY SAID HE HIS FACE BRIGHTENING WITH JOYOUS RECOGNITION MY TINKLER'S GOT THIS ON IT--JUST THE VERY MORAL OF IT SO E AS THEN HE HAD TO TELL ALL ABOUT TINKLER AND THE LADY LOOKED THOUGHTFUL AND INTERESTED
THINK OF THAT
WE SHALL WANT IT AGAIN
NOT AT ALL I DON'T DO NOT SAY THAT TO THEM THE NURSE SAID LOOKING AT HIM VERY GRAVELY
THEY WOULD HAVE MADE HIM HAPPY BUT FOR ONE THING
BUT THIS DICKIE ONLY NOTICED LATER
AND NOW YOU KNOW SO HE LAY STILL RIGID WITH MISERY AND DESPAIR
THE ARDENS STAY WHERE DUTY BINDS THEM AND GO WHERE DUTY CALLS BUT I'M NOT AN ARDEN THERE SAID DICKIE SADLY
IT WAS GIVE ME SAID HE FOR LEARNING OF SOMETHING--AND WE'VE GOT TO GET IT UP SO AS NO ONE SEES US
BUT THE SPEAKER RAISED HIS HAND AND SILENCE WAITED HIS NEXT WORDS
IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN TRUE HE JUMPED UP EAGER TO START FOR GRAVESEND
I KNOW THAT'S WOT I GOT HIM FOR--ALL RIGHT
HE THOUGHT OVER THIS VERY CAREFULLY
IF I COULD ONLY BUY BACK THE REST OF THE LAND I'D SHOW SOME PEOPLE WHAT A MODEL VILLAGE IS LIKE
I LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU KINDLY SAID DICKIE PRESENTLY
MEN STRUGGLED AND FOUGHT ALL ABOUT HIM
THEY CALLED IT LYING AND CHEATING WHERE I WAS--IN MY DREAM I MEAN ONCE LET A NIPPER OUT OF YER SIGHT SAID MR BEALE SADLY AND SEE WHAT COMES OF IT
THE BARE THICK STEMS OF THE FURZE HELD IT UP LIKE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS AS THEY SAT
HE BEGAN TO TEAR OFF THE ARMOR
THE ONE IS AS REAL AS THE OTHER HE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND WENT LEAPING ROUND THE ROOM JUMPING ON TO CHAIRS AND OFF THEM RUNNING AND DANCING
IT WAS LIKE A REDOUTE WHICH IS A FANCY-DRESS BALL WHERE THE GUESTS MAY WEAR ANY DRESS THEY CHOOSE ONLY ALL THE DRESSES MUST BE OF ONE COLOR
TO DICKIE LORD ARDEN SAID OF COURSE IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO SHOW THAT I AM REALLY LORD ARDEN YOU WON'T DESERT US DICKIE
BUT I'VE LEARNED A LOT OF GREEK AND LATIN TOO HE ADDED IN A HURRY AND POETRY AND THINGS LIKE THAT I FEAR SAID THE FATHER THOU DOST NOT LOVE THY BOOK I DO SIR
I AM HERE SAID LORD ARDEN
HE MUST MAKE IT APPEAR THAT HE RICHARD LORD ARDEN WAS DEAD
HE FELT AS A MAN MIGHT FEEL WHO BEHELD ONCE MORE THE SEAPORT FROM WHICH IN OLD AND BEAUTIFUL DAYS HE HAD SET SAIL FOR THE SHORES OF ROMANCE THE GOLDEN SPLENDOR OF THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS
EVEN IF HE GOT OUT HOW COULD HE FIND HIS COUSINS
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND MORE THAN ARF OF WOT E WAS SAYING
I USED TO THINK I LIKED MAGIC AND THINGS
HE HAD HAD NO IDEA THAT ANY ONE'S LAP COULD BE SO COMFORTABLE
AND ONCE A FILM OF A PHOTOGRAPH THAT WE'D STUCK UP BEHAVED LIKE A CINEMATOGRAPH AND THEN WE SAW THE TREASURE BEING HIDDEN AWAY THEN LET'S JUST GO WHERE THAT WAS--MARK THE SPOT COME HOME AND THEN DIG IT UP IT WASN'T BURIED ELFRIDA EXPLAINED
IT'S JUST THE NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE ME MIND UP IF HE'S THERE SAID DICKIE DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO JUST ON THE CHANCE OF HIM BEING THERE AND WANTING YOU IF YOU COME TO OUGHTS SAID BEALE I OUGHTER GONE OME ANY TIME THIS TWENTY YEAR
HE KNEW THAT THIS MUST BE A DREAM AND THAT BEALE AND GRAVESEND AND NEW CROSS AND THE OLD LAME LIFE WERE THE REAL THING AND YET HE COULD NOT WAKE UP
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T URT A AIR OF YER ED SO I WOULDN'T I WANTED US TO LIVE HONEST BY OUR WORK--WE WAS DOING IT
BUT IT WAS NOT EASY
I DON'T MIND
HOW CAN WE GET HOME THE OLD WAY HE SAID
INDEED THOU HAST SHE SAID BUT SHE LIES SICK AT YOUR FATHER'S OTHER HOUSE
WHICH WAS UNTRUE
AND DICKIE HIMSELF
MIGHTN'T THAT ONE FLEW TO FETCH IT
I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS
HER EYES WERE THE EYES TO WHICH IT IS GOOD TO LAUGH--HER ARMS WERE THE ARMS IN WHICH IT IS GOOD TO CRY
WE THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T BE REAL BECAUSE WE WROTE A LETTER TO YOU AT THE ADDRESS IT SAID ON THAT BILL YOU GAVE US
AND THE TWO FOLLOWED ELFRIDA BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE JUST GOING TO BE KIND AND TO TAKE PART IN SOME CHILDISH GAME OF MAKE-BELIEVE
WHAT I MEANTER SAY IF ANYTHING'S APPENED TO IM
HE HAD DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO AND HE HAD DONE IT WELL
IT WAS ALL SO DIFFICULT
STILL IN THE FEW MOMENTS WHEN THEY WERE ALL DRESSED AND WAITING FOR THE DOG-CART TO COME ROUND DICKIE FOUND A CHANCE TO WHISPER TO ELFRIDA LET'S ALL THINK OF UNLIKELY PLACES AS HARD AS EVER WE CAN
CAUSE I'VE GOT A FRIEND AS'LL CHANGE EM FOR ME AND THEN WE'LL AVE NEW CLOBBER AND SOME MORE FURNITURE AND A CARPET AND A CROCKERY BASIN TO WASH OUR HANDS AND FACES IN STEAD OF THAT OLD TIN THING
YOU MUST UNCHAIN THE DOG AND TAKE HIM TO THE MILESTONE BY THE CROSSROADS
YOU KEEP ALL ON ABOUT YER DREAMS
ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE SLENDER SPOON THAT DICKIE HAD TO EAT HIS EGG WITH
AND IN THAT LIFE ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED SHALL MEET AND BE TOGETHER FOREVERMORE IN THAT LIFE WHEN ALL THE DEAR AND NOBLE DREAMS OF THE EARTHLY LIFE SHALL AT LAST AND FOREVER BE SOMETHING MORE THAN DREAMS THE END TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES
THE CHILDREN TURNED AND LOOKED AT THE OPENING
HE WONDERED WHERE HIS CRUTCH WAS
THERE'S TIME ENOUGH IN THE MORNING SHE CARRIED DICKIE OUT OF THE DRAWING-ROOM AND AWAY FROM THE OTHER PEOPLE TO A BIG ROOM WITH BLUE WALLS AND BLUE AND GRAY CURTAINS AND BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE
IT WAS A SACRIFICE
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS WONDERFUL CHANGE SHOULD HAPPEN TO ANY ONE BESIDES HIMSELF
SEE AND IF I'M NABBED WHAT IS IT I AM TO SAY YOU MUST LET ON AS A STRANGE CHAP COLLARED YOU ON THE ROAD A STRANGE CHAP WITH A BLACK BEARD AND A RED ANKERCHER AND GIVE YOU A LICKING IF YOU DIDN'T GO AND CLIMB IN AT THE WINDOW
I SHOULD LIKE SAID DICKIE SITTING SQUARE ON THE GRAY TO CALL HIM CRUTCH
SUPPOSE YOU WAS TO GET PINCHED WHAT UD PINCH ME
DICKIE'S CLOTHES LAY A DUSTY FORLORN LITTLE HEAP IN A STATELY TAPESTRY-COVERED CHAIR
HE COULD NOT BE LEFT OUT OF THIS THE MOST MYSTERIOUS OF ALL THE HAPPENINGS THAT HAD SO WONDERFULLY COME TO HIM
BUT AFTERWARDS HE HAD TO OWN THAT IT WAS A JOLLY LUCKY THING FOR BEALE AND FOR HIMSELF TOO
SHE WAS A DELAMERE AND MY NAME WAS DELAMERE TOO BEFORE I WAS MARRIED
SO THOU'ST FOUND THY TONGUE SHE SAID
HE FELT AS YOU WOULD FEEL IF YOU SUDDENLY FOUND YOUR HANDS COVERED WITH FILTH NOT GOOD HONEST DIRT BUT SLIMY FILTH AND WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD HAVE LET IT GET THERE
AND WITH THE IDEA VERY NEAR AND PLAIN HE PUT HIS ARMS ROUND HER NECK AND HUGGED HER
I SHOULD THINK SO AH SAID DICKIE AND A FULL SILENCE FELL BETWEEN THEM
BUT HE PRESENTLY PERCEIVED THAT THOUGH HE WAS SO CLOSE TO ARDEN CASTLE HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH NEARER TO THE ARDEN CHILDREN
YOU DID--DID YOU
BUT BEFORE HE SPREAD OUT THE SEEDS HE TOOK CERTAIN OTHER THINGS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND HELD THEM CLOSELY
AND AS SOON AS SHE HAD TOLD HIM A THING HE FOUND HE REMEMBERED IT--NOT AS ONE REMEMBERS A TALE THAT IS TOLD BUT AS ONE REMEMBERS A REAL THING THAT HAS HAPPENED
AND A STOUT YOUNG NURSE BROUGHT THE BABY AND DICKIE LOVED IT AND FELT CERTAIN IT LOVED HIM THOUGH IT ONLY SAID GOO GA GOO EXACTLY AS YOUR BABY-BROTHER DOES NOW AND GOT HOLD OF DICKIE'S HAIR AND PULLED IT AND WOULD NOT LET GO
IT MADE A RING OF LIGHT ROUND THEM
AND WHEN THE GENTLEMAN CAME IN AND KISSED HER AND SAID HOW WERE WE THIS MORNING DICKIE HAD TO TELL ABOUT TINKLER ALL OVER AGAIN
THERE WERE LITTLE HOLES IN THE GOLD KNOB SUCH AS YOU SEE IN THE TOPS OF PEPPER CASTORS AND THE SCENT SEEMED TO COME THROUGH THEM
LODGINGS
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TO SAID THE SAME SOFT SMALL VOICE THAT HAD SPOKEN BEFORE
MR BEALE LOOKED DOWN AT THE TOUCH
DICKIE WILL BE ALL RIGHT SOMEHOW
AND HE GOT QUITE A DIFFERENT SET OF CLOTHES OUT OF HIS BUNDLES AND PUT THEM ON
I LAY IT'LL COME UP SOMETHING PRETTY SO THE SEED WAS SOWN
THEY GOT HOME AND ROUSED LORD ARDEN AND TOLD HIM DICKIE WAS FOUND AND ALL ABOUT IT AND HE ROUSED THE HOUSE AND HE AND BEALE AND HALF-A-DOZEN MEN FROM THE VILLAGE WENT UP TO THE CAVE AND FOUND THAT WICKED MAN AND WOMAN IN A STUPID SLEEP AND TIED THEIR HANDS AND MARCHED THEM TO THE TOWN AND TO THE POLICE-STATION
HE LOVED INDEED EVERYTHING IN THIS NEW LIFE--THE SHAPES AND COLORS OF FURNITURE AND HANGINGS THE KIND OLD NURSE THE FRIENDLY LAUGHING MAIDS THE OLD DOCTOR WITH HIS LONG SPEECHES AND SHORT SMILES HIS BED HIS ROOM THE SHIPS THE RIVER THE TREES THE GARDENS--THE VERY SKY SEEMED CLEANER AND BRIGHTER THAN THE SKY THAT HAD BEEN OVER THE DEPTFORD THAT DICKIE HARDING HAD KNOWN
AND HITHERTO HE HAD LOVED ONLY BEALE
SO LONG MATEY MR BEALE SLOUCHED OFF IN THE SUNSHINE IN HIS FILTHY OLD CLOTHES AND DICKIE WAS LEFT TO WORK ALONE IN THE GREEN AND GOLDEN WOOD
FORGET THE DREAMS OF THY CHILDHOOD AND PLAY THE MAN TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND OF THE HOUSE OF ARDEN
BURGLARS 31 III
IT'S NO USE YOUR GETTING YOUR KNIFE INTO ME HE SAID AS THE TOWEL WAS PLIED
HE IS MUCH TOO GREAT
THOU'LT HAVE LESSONS ALONE TO-DAY
SO THAT WAS SETTLED
THE NIPPER MADE IT PINCHED IT MORE LIKELY SOME ONE SAID
IT'S A ARD LIFE FOR THE LIKES OF IM MUM HE OUGHT TO BE AT HOME WITH HIS MOTHER SAID THE LADY
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THEM
I'VE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH SAID DICKIE PAGE 304 YOU SHAN'T SAID ELFRIDA
IF THEY DID NOT KNOW HIM IT SHOULD NOT BE HIS FAULT
AN MY GRANDFATHER E FARMED IS OWN LAND IN SUSSEX SHE TOLD THEM LOOKING WITH BLEARED EYES ACROSS THE FIELDS
THEY WOULDN'T LOOK AT US WE'LL GET THREE QUID RIGHT ENOUGH AFORE WE DONE SAID DICKIE FIRMLY
SOMEHOW DICKIE COULD NOT BEAR TO LET THAT LADY SEE HIM CRAWL CLUMSILY ACROSS THE FLOOR AS HE HAD TO DO WHEN HE MOVED WITHOUT HIS CRUTCH
THEY LAID HIM IN THE BARROW COVERED HIM WITH THE CLOAK AND PUT VEGETABLE MARROWS AND CABBAGES ON THAT
DICKIE STILL ON MR BEALE'S SHOULDERS WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HOW QUIETLY THIS BIG CLUMSY-LOOKING MAN COULD MOVE
OW MUCH A WEEK'S FOUR BOB A DAY
DO THE SAME FOR YOU SOME DAY HE ADDED
US'LL AVE A FOURPENNY DOSS OUTER THIS SAID BEALE
IT WAS A CHAIR--NO A CARRIAGE
AN THE DOGS AN ALL
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THESE THINGS VERY SHORTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DREAM-LIKE TO DICKIE AND NOT AT ALL REAL LIKE THE DOUBLE LIFE HE HAD BEEN LEADING
THE LITTLE HORSE TURNED ROUND TO LOOK AT THEM FROM HIS STALL IN THE BIG STABLES
A STOUT WOMAN IN VERY FULL SKIRTS SAT IN A LARGE ARMCHAIR AT THE FOOT OF THE BED
EVERYTHING WAS DARK AT THE COTTAGE
AND WHEN DICKIE OPENED THIS AND SHOWERED THE TWENTY GOLD COINS INTO A HOLLOW OF THE DRAB TICKING HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND SIGHED AND OPENED THEM AGAIN AND SAID GIVE YOU
HE TOOK OFF HIS JACKET AND THREW IT OVER HIS HANDS TO PROTECT THEM AND SEIZING AN ARMFUL OF FURZE PULLED AND FELL BACK A GREAT BUNDLE OF THE PRICKLY STUFF ON TOP OF HIM
BE HAPPY AND JOLLY AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT GROWN-UP THINGS
IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SIMPLE TO HAVE THE BRICKWORK KNOCKED OUT AND TO LET THE STREAM FIND ITS WAY BACK IF IT COULD TO ITS OLD CHANNEL AND THENCE DOWN THE ARCHED WAY WHICH EDRED AND ELFRIDA TOLD HIM THEY WERE CERTAIN WAS UNDER A MOUND BELOW THE CASTLE
HE TURNED TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE WAS NO DOOR
AND EVERY HOUSE ON ARDEN LAND SHALL BE MADE SOUND AND WEATHER-TIGHT AND COMFORTABLE
HE SAW WHEN HE REACHED THE UPPER LANDING THAT THE OTHERS WERE BY THE WINDOW AND THAT THE WINDOW WAS OPEN
GIMME SAID DICKIE--'GIMME A PENN'ORTH O THAT THERE HE FOUND THE CORN-CHANDLER'S--A REALLY CHARMING SHOP THAT SMELLED LIKE STABLES AND HAD DEEP DUSTY BINS WHERE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO PLAY
I WOULDN'T IF I WAS YOU SAID DICKIE LOOKING STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM AS THEY WALKED
I SHALL LIVE BUT TO REPAY YOUR BOUNTEOUS GEN'ROSITY NONE OF YOUR CHEEK SAID THE PAWNBROKER REDDENING AND THERE WAS AN AWKWARD PAUSE
WELL IF YOU MUST AVE IT SAID BEALE WE'RE A-GETTIN VERY NEAR MY OLE DAD'S PLACE AND I CAN'T MAKE ME MIND UP I THOUGHT WE WAS SETTLED WE'D GO TO SEE IM I DUNNO
I DON'T MORE'N ARF LIKE IT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
GET THY HOSE ON FOR SHAME TAKING A CHILL AS LIKE AS NOT
AND WHEN YOU WOULD RETURN SAID THE NURSE YOU KNOW THE WAY DO I YOU LAY THE RATTLE THE SEAL AND THE MOON-SEEDS AS BEFORE AND LISTEN TO THE VOICES AND THEN DICKIE LAY DOWN IN THE CLOTH CLOAK AND THE NURSE SAT BY HIM AND HELD HIS HAND TILL HE FELL ASLEEP
NO I DIDN'T I KNEW YOUR CLEVER WAYS--I KNEW YOU WAS BOUND TO TURN UP YES SAID DICKIE LOOKING ROUND THE TRAMPS KITCHEN AND REMEMBERING THE LONG CLEAN TAPESTRY-HUNG DINING-HALL OF HIS DREAM
AND THERE IN REAL FACT WAS THE TREASURE JUST AS THE CHILDREN HAD SEEN IT--THE CHESTS AND THE BOXES AND THE LEATHERN SACKS AND THE BUNDLES DONE UP IN STRAW AND IN HANDKERCHIEFS
PERHAPS HE WAS FEVERISH
BE OFF AFORE THE SOLDIERS SEES YOU THEY SQUEEZED INTO THE SWAN CARRIAGE ALL THREE
IT'S AS GOOD AS A GAFF ANY DAY TO EAR IM
AN I CAN'T GO AND LEAVE THE LITTLE BEAST TILL HE KNOWS IMSELF A BIT IN IS NOO PLACE SAID MR BEALE AN AVE IM BOLTIN OFF GRACIOUS KNOWS WHERE AND BEING PINCHED OR CARTED OFF TO THE DOGS HOME OR THAT
HAVEN'T WE SEEMED ODD TO YOU AT ALL
OH YES I KNOW
WAS YOUR BED COMFORTABLE AIN'T IT SOFT NEITHER HE ANSWERED
HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF AND SHE CAME UP TO HIM AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH KIND EYES
YOU DID THAT BIT FINE SAID BEALE--"FINE YOU DID
THE FURZE HE HAD PULLED AWAY DISCLOSED A HOLE AND TRUE WAS DISAPPEARING DOWN IT
THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS SAID THE NURSE
HE CREPT INTO THE HOUSE HOLDING THE STALK UPRIGHT AND STEADY AS AN ACOLYTE CARRIES A PROCESSIONAL CROSS
THERE ALSO YOU MAY READ OF THE MARVELS OF THE WHITE CLOCK AND THE CLIFF THAT NONE COULD CLIMB AND THE CHILDREN WHO WERE WHITE CATS AND THE MOULDIWARP WHO BECAME AS BIG AS A POLAR BEAR WITH OTHER WONDERS
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GETTING BORED WITH ALL THIS
NO CRIMSON ALLOWED ELFRIDA CAUGHT EDRED'S HAND
HOIL IT UP WITH A DROP OF COLD LINSEED AND LEAVE IT ALL NIGHT AND THEN IN THE MORNING YOU RUB IT ON YER TROUSER LEG TO SHINE IT AND THEN RUB IT IN THE MUD TO DIRTY IT AND THEN HOIL IT AGAIN AND DIRTY IT AGAIN AND YOU'LL GET ARF A THICK UN FOR IT AS A GENUWINE HOLD ANTIQUE
AND THEN COME EVENING WE'RE A-GOIN TO AVE OUR BEANO
LET'S GO AND GET A MUG AND A DOOR-STEP AND THEN WE'LL SEE YOU GET IT--IF YOU'RE HUNGRY SAID DICKIE
AN THE LITTLE ONE
BUT DON'T YOU LET ON TO ANY ONE IT'S GRAVESEND YOU'RE A-COMING TO
E'S COME TO SEE YOU AN E'S WAITING OUTSIDE NOW TO KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IM THEN E OUGHTER KNOW BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN AND SHOUTED IN A THIN HIGH VOICE JIM JIM COME ALONG IN THIS MINUTE EVEN THEN BEALE DIDN'T ACT A BIT LIKE THE PRODIGAL IN THE PLAY
AND HE CAN ONLY BE AWAKENED BY SOME NOBLE DEED
HE HAD TO FOLLOW
TIS NOT EASY TO BRING THOSE WE LOVE FROM ONE DREAM TO ANOTHER ONE DREAM TO ANOTHER DIDST NEVER HEAR THAT ALL LIFE IS A DREAM SHE ASKED HIM
DON'T IT MAKE YER LEGS STIFF NEITHER HE ROLLED OVER TOOK THE PAPER AND READ IT SLOWLY AND WITH DIFFICULTY
OUR GARDENING FRIEND WANTH A LITHTHON
WE SHALL GET THERE FIRST IF WE RUN OUR HARDEST ELFRIDA'S FATHER SAID
LONG MAY E ENJOY IS FIND SAYS I
SO NOW WE'RE AGREED UPON IT IF YOU'LL STEP IT WE'LL SEE ABOUT A DOSS FOR TO-NIGHT
COME DOWN BEALE AND GET A LANTERN
HE NOTICED THAT THE NURSES AND THE DOCTORS SPOKE IN THE KIND OF WORDS THAT HE HAD FOUND IN HIS BOOKS AND IN A VOICE THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND ANYWHERE
ITS PAVEMENTS WERE OF RED BRICK AND ITS HOUSES OF WHITE STONE AND ITS BOW-WINDOWS AND BALCONIES WERE GREEN AND DICKIE THOUGHT IT WAS THE PRETTIEST TOWN IN THE WORLD
GREAT MOULDIESTWARP ON YOU WE CALL TO DO THE GREATEST MAGIC OF ALL
BUT YOU LEARNED ALL THAT AT SCHOOL
SEBASTIAN LOOKED UP AT THE VOICE AND CEASED THE BLOWS WITH WHICH HIS AXE WAS SMOOTHING A GREAT TREE TRUNK THAT WAS TO BE A MAST AND SMILED IN ANSWER TO HIS SMILE
LOOK ERE SAID DICKIE WHAT I MEAN TO SAY HE STOPPED
YOU LISTEN HARD AND BELIEVE WITH BOTH HANDS AND WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BELIEVE AT ALL
ASKING SO INTIMATE A FAVOR FROM THE SOUR-FACED TUTOR WHOM HE SO MUCH DISLIKED WAS NEITHER EASY NOR PLEASANT
THE MAN WHO HAD BOUGHT HIM A LITTLE COAT TO PUT ON O NIGHTS IF IT WAS COLD OR WET
THE STREAM KNOWING ITS OWN MIND BETTER AND BETTER AS IT RECOGNIZED ITS OLD ROAD REACHED THE CASTLE AND BY DINNER-TIME ALL THE GRASS ROUND THE CASTLE WAS UNDER WATER
BUT THAT COMES FURTHER ON IN THE STORY DICKIE LEFT THE SHOP WITHOUT HIS MOONFLOWERS INDEED BUT WITH HIS TINKLER NOW WHITELY SHINING AND DECLARED TO BE REAL SILVER AND MIND YOU TAKE CARE OF IT MY LAD HIS WHITE CORNELIAN SEAL CAREFULLY PACKED IN A STRONG LITTLE CARDBOARD BOX WITH METAL CORNERS
YET I LOVE MY SPORTS BETTER SAID DICKIE AND LOOKED UP TO MEET THE FOND PROUD LOOK OF EYES AS BLUE AS HIS OWN
EVERY SOUL HAS ONE SUCH CHANCE A CHANCE TO BE PERFECTLY UNSELFISH ABSOLUTELY NOBLE AND TRUE
NOR WAS IT SUNDAY ON WHICH THEY TOOK A REST AND WASHED THEIR SHIRTS ACCORDING TO MR BEALE'S RULE OF LIFE
HE REMEMBERED THE LESSON NOW AND SET TO WORK--BUT IT WAS SLOW WORK
AND BY ALL THE LAWS OF FAIR PLAY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME ONE NOW TO HELP HIM
TWO DAYS--A GREAT WHILE A GREAT GREAT WHILE I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW SAID DICKIE PICKING UP AN AWL AND FEELING ITS POINT
MR BEALE HAD HAD IT UNDER HIS ARM
BUT DICKIE WHISPERED DON'T WAIT FOR ME
IT HAD GREAT DROOPING LEAVES AND A DOZEN SMALLER WHITE FLOWERS STOOD OUT BELOW IT ON LONG STALKS THINNER THAN THAT NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE MOONFLOWER ITSELF
CHAPTER IV WHICH WAS THE DREAM
FOR SHE WAS NOT REALLY HIS AUNT BUT JUST THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE WHERE HIS FATHER HAD LODGED
HIS BACK ACHED
THEY WERE BIGGER THAN SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND FLATTER AND ROUNDER AND THEY SHONE LIKE SILVER OR LIKE THE PODS OF THE PLANT WE CALL HONESTY
BUT THESE SEEDS--THE MOON-SEEDS HE PULLED OUT A HANDFUL
WHAT IS IT MY DEARIE IF I AM REALLY THE NAME YOU SAID I'VE FORGOTTEN IT
HOUT YER GETS SAID MR BEALE QUICKLY
BECAUSE LOVING PEOPLE IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD--BETTER EVEN THAN BEING LOVED
AN I SAYS WHY NOT TAKE TO THE ROAD A BIT NOW AND AGAIN AN YOU SAYS WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT COME SUMMER AND ERE IS COME SUMMER
YES IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE WISE TO GO TO-NIGHT TO GET IN BY THE FRONT WINDOW--THE CATCH HAD ALWAYS BEEN BROKEN--TO FIND HIS TREASURES OR AT ANY RATE TO MAKE QUITE SURE WHETHER HE HAD LOST THEM OR NOT
BUT--"WE'LL BE BEGGARS YOU MEAN HE SAID DOUBTFULLY
ARD AS ANY OLD DOOR-STEP IT IS
WE ARE NOT WHAT WE SEEM EDRED AND I
I WANT TO STAY HERE NURSE
IF THEY DIDN'T REMEMBER HIM THEY'D THINK HE WAS MAD AND NEVER SHOW HIM THE CASTLE
NEXT MOMENT A VOICE SPOKE SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT HE STARTED AND ALL BUT CRIED OUT
HE WENT BOLDLY INTO THE SHOP WHICH HAD THREE HANDSOME GOLD BALLS HANGING OUT ABOVE ITS DOOR AND IN ITS WINDOW ALL SORTS OF PRETTY THINGS--RINGS AND CHAINS AND BROOCHES AND WATCHES AND CHINA AND SILK HANDKERCHIEFS AND CONCERTINAS
IF SHE HADN'T AND THEY WERE STILL THERE WOULD IT NOT BE WISE TO GET THEM AT ONCE
WE MUGGER ALONG SOME'OW
IT WAS AFTER THE DREAM THAT SLEEP CAME--A WHOLE GOOD NIGHTFUL OF IT SO DICKIE FELT THAT FOR BEALE NO TIME AT ALL HAD PASSED AND THAT WHEN HE WENT BACK--WHICH HE MEANT TO DO--HE WOULD GET BACK TO DEPTFORD AT THE SAME INSTANT AS HE LEFT IT
AND THUS IT HAPPENED THAT WHEN HE DID GO BACK TO MR BEALE HE WENT BECAUSE HIS HEART CALLED HIM AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON AT ALL
BUT E WAS A GAME OLD CHAP--SHOULDN'T WONDER BUT WHAT HE'D STUCK IT OUT LET'S GO AND SEE HIM SOME DAY SAID DICKIE
IT WAS A LONG WAY TO LONDON AND HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DREAM THAT DREAM AGAIN
WHO'S THERE SAID HE
AND DAYS WENT ON AND HE BECAME SURER AND SURER THAT HE WAS REALLY THIS OTHER RICHARD AND THAT HE HAD ONLY DREAMED ALL THAT OLD LIFE IN NEW CROSS WITH HIS AUNT AND IN THE PLEASANT COUNTRY ROADS WITH MR BEALE
AND ABOVE THE DRAWERS PICTURES OF THE KIND OF ANIMALS THAT WERE FED ON THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THE SHOP SOLD
A WOMAN THEY HAD OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD HAD GIVEN HIM A BIT OF BLUE RIBBON FOR THE PUPPY'S NECK IN RETURN FOR THE LIFT WHICH MR BEALE HAD GIVEN HER BASKET ON THE PERAMBULATOR
BUT HE COULD NOT WAIT TO WONDER ABOUT IT OR TO QUESTION WHAT IT WAS THAT HE REALLY FELT
AND I CARVED A LITTLE BOX--A FAIR TREAT IT WAS--WITH MY FATHER'S ARMS ON IT YER FATHER'S WHAT COAT OF ARMS
BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING THE OTHER TWO LOOKED AT HIM AND AT EACH OTHER AND THE BOY SAID RIGHTO YOU'RE FROM THE CASTLE AREN'T YOU HE SAID
AND FIRST CHANCE YOU GET YOU SLIP OFF AND YOU COME TO THAT OUSE WHERE YOU AND ME SLEP AT GRAVESEND
AND TO EAR THE WAY E DOES THE PATTER TO ME ON THE ROAD
AND THY VERY OWN FOR I MADE IT FOR THEE IT WAS INDEED A PRETTY LITTLE SHIP BEING A PERFECT MODEL OF AN ELIZABETHAN SHIP BUILT UP HIGH AT BOW AND STERN FOR AS SEBASTIAN EXPLAINED MAJESTY AND TERROR OF THE ENEMY AND WITH DECK AND ORLOP WAIST AND POOP HOLD AND MASTS--ALL COMPLETE WITH FORECASTLE AND CABIN MASTS AND SPARS PORT-HOLES AND GUNS SAILS ANCHOR AND CARVED FIGURE-HEAD
AND I'LL GET SOME PROPER CARVING TOOLS
THE PAWNBROKER ALWAYS A GOOD FRIEND TO DICKIE HAD THE WIT TO SEE THAT THE CHILD WAS NOT LYING WHEN HE SAID THAT THE BOX AND THE BAG AND THE GOLD PIECES HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM
YOU WON'T BE SORRY
THOU AND I WE HAVE WROUGHT A CURE
HE HAD NOT LOOKED AT THEM IN THESE NEW DAYS
THE KITCHEN WAS PLEASANT AND COZY THOUGH RATHER DARK ON ACCOUNT OF THE WHITE CLIMBING ROSE THAT GREW ROUND THE WINDOW
BUT EVEN THOSE BEAUTIFUL PICTURES COULD NOT KEEP DICKIE'S THOUGHTS FROM MR BEALE
BUT HE HAD NOT GOT TO STRIVE WITH PRIDE BEFORE THE DEAR LADY CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING BLESS MY DEAR SON
NO LITTLE GIRL WAS EVER MORE POLITE THAN ELFRIDA OR LESS ANXIOUS TO HURT THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS
AND THEY ALL CLIMBED A CHILL DAMP PARK-FENCE AND CREPT ALONG AMONG TREES AND SHRUBS ALONG THE INSIDE OF A HIGH PARK WALL
IT WAS PANELLED
E AIN'T GOT NO MOTHER HE SAID
OH WHAT A DREAM HE PUT TINKLER AND THE SEAL IN ONE POCKET GATHERED UP THE MOON-SEEDS AND PUT THEM IN THE OTHER DREW THE OLD NEWSPAPERS OVER HIM AND WENT TO SLEEP
IT WAS NOT THE NEXT DAY WHICH WAS A SATURDAY THAT THEY TOOK THE TRAIN LIKE DUKES
THE LADY WENT TO ONE OF THE CARVED CABINETS AND WITH A BRIGHT KEY FROM A VERY BRIGHT BUNCH UNLOCKED ONE OF THE HEAVY PANELLED DOORS
THE TIMES YOU ARE BORN IN ARE ALWAYS MORE HOME-LIKE THAN ANY OTHER TIMES CAN BE
IT WAS A VERY ODD FEELING
SO DICKIE CHANGED EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY AND EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY HOUR FROM THE LITTLE BOY WHO LIVED AT NEW CROSS AMONG THE YELLOW HOUSES AND THE UGLINESS WHO TRAMPED THE WHITE ROADS AND SLEPT AT THE INN OF THE SILVER MOON TO RICHARD OF THE OTHER NAME WHO LIVED WELL AND SLEPT SOFTLY AND KNEW HIMSELF CALLED TO A DESTINY OF POWER AND HELPFUL KINDNESS
I LIKES A ORSE
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE AFTER
THE CASTLE WILL BE RESTORED--ALMOST CERTAINLY
AND THEN THEY SAW THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL WAS A THRONE OF SILVER SPREAD WITH A FRINGED CLOTH OF CHECKERED SILVER AND GREEN AND ON IT WITH THE MOULDIWARP STANDING ON ONE SIDE AND THE MOULDIERWARP ON THE OTHER THE MOULDIESTWARP WAS SEATED IN STATE AND SPLENDOR
THE SEAL'S NOT WORTH IT
AND A HORSE
HE STAYED AN HOUR AT THE KENNELS AND CAME AWAY KNOWING VERY MUCH MORE ABOUT DOGS THAN HE DID BEFORE THOUGH SOME OF THE THINGS HE LEARNED WOULD SURPRISE A MODERN VETERINARY SURGEON VERY MUCH INDEED
NOW KITCHEN PHYSIC IT IS THAT HE NEEDS--GOOD BROTH AND GRUEL AND PANADA AND WINE THE RHENISH AND THE FRENCH AND THE JUICE OF THE ORANGE AND THE LEMON OR FAILING THOSE FRESH APPLE-JUICE SQUEEZED FROM THE FRUIT WHEN YOU SHALL HAVE BRAYED IT IN A MORTAR
LADY TALBOT HUGGED HIM TENDERLY
HUSH
EVERYBODY GLANCED AT THEM FOR THEY WERE WONDERFUL FLOWERS AS WHITE AS WATER-LILIES ONLY FLAT--THE REAL SUNFLOWER SHAPE--AND THEIR CENTRES WERE OF THE PUREST YELLOW GOLD COLOR
BUT THOU SHALT GO
HE'S PERFECTLY INNOCENT AND SHE KISSED DICKIE'S HAIR VERY SOFTLY AND KINDLY
ALL THIS WAS WON AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHOM HE LOVED BEST--THE CHILDREN WHO WERE HIS DEAR COUSINS AND PLAYFELLOWS THE MAN THEIR FATHER WHO HAD MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO ESTABLISH DICKIE'S CLAIM TO THE TITLE AND HAD BEEN CONTENT QUIETLY TO STAND ASIDE AND GIVE UP TITLE CASTLE LANDS AND TREASURE TO THE LITTLE CRIPPLE FROM DEPTFORD
THERE WAS A BURST OF IMPRISONED SPLENDOR
HE WAS IN THE LITTLE BARE FRONT ROOM IN NEW CROSS
AND THEN ANOTHER PICTURE CAME TO HIM--HE SAW THE MISTY LAST LIGHT FAINTING BEYOND THE GREAT SHOULDERS OF THE DOWNS AND THE LITTLE STARSES SHINING SO BRIGHT AND NEW THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF FIR TREES THAT INTERLACED ABOVE A SWEET-SCENTED BED OF SOFT FALLEN BROWN PINE-NEEDLES
DICKIE'S MUG PAUSED IN AIR HALF-WAY TO HIS MOUTH WHICH REMAINED OPEN
HE WON'T GIVE US AWAY
YOU KNOW HOW HE TALKED TO HIS AUNT AND THE MAN NEXT DOOR
I THOUGHT YOU'D GOT PINCHED
YES I CAN
TWENTY-TWO POUNDS OF THE MONEY WAS PUT IN THE SAVINGS BANK
BUT THE ROOM WAS NOT TAPESTRIED
THEY ONLY LEFT HIM A LITTLE ROOM TO BREATHE
AN E'S GOT SO RED IN THE FACE AND PLUMPED OUT SO THEY'LL SOON SAY E DOESN'T WANT THEIR DIBS STARVE IM A BIT SAID THE RED-WHISKERED MAN CHEERFULLY
YOU'RE ONLY A LITTLE BOY
AND THE LITTLE UN E TIDIED ME UP AND TOLD ME TALES AND KEP ME STRAIGHT
STREW FRESH HERBS AND FLOWERS AND SET ALL CLEAN AND IN ORDER AND GIVE THANKS THAT YOU ARE NOT SETTING ALL IN ORDER FOR A BURYING WITH WHICH AGREEABLE WORDS THE BLACK-GOWNED DOCTOR NODDED AND SMILED AT THE LITTLE PATIENT AND WENT OUT
SHOULD HE ASK FOR A LIFT WHEN THE CARTER CAME OUT OF THE MARQUIS
NOT A WORD ABOUT BURGLARS DID SHE SAY ONLY I WANTED TO ADOPT DICKIE ONCE LORD ARDEN BUT HE WOULD NOT STAY I HAD TO GET BACK TO FATHER SAID DICKIE
HE WENT BACK INSTEAD TO THE TIME HE LOVED WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING
ALL THE WAY PRETTY NEAR SAID THE MAN
I WANT TO WAKE UP
ALL OUR TRUCK WHAT WE'LL WANT ON THE ROAD SAID BEALE
LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS HUMPREYS CHANGED TO HUMPHREYS HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE PAGE 6 PENNORTH CHANGED TO PENN'ORTH GIMME A PENN'ORTH PAGE 249 TWO CHANGED TO TOO ONLY TOO WELL END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF HARDING'S LUCK BY E
HE SCRIBBLED ON THE BACK OF THIS BILL GAVE IT TO EDRED AND THEN THEY ALL WENT OUT ON THE ROOF AND SHOVELLED SNOW IN ON TO MR PARADOS AND WHEN HE CAME OUT ON THE ROOF VERY SOON AND ANGRY THEY SLIPPED ROUND THE CHIMNEY-STACKS AND THROUGH THE TRAP-DOOR AND LEFT HIM UP ON THE ROOF IN THE SNOW AND SHUT THE TRAP-DOOR AND HASPED IT
IT TURNED OUT THAT MORE THAN ONE OLD MAN IN THE VILLAGE HAD HEARD FROM HIS FATHER ABOUT THE CAVES AND THE SMUGGLING THAT HAD GONE ON IN THOSE PARTS IN OLD ANCIENT DAYS
SO THEN EDRED TOOK HOLD OF A BRANCH OF FURZE TO CUT IT AND IT WAS LOOSE AND CAME AWAY IN HIS HAND WITHOUT ANY CUTTING
THE NURSE HAD TAUGHT HIM THIS IN THE DREAM WHEN HE WAS STILL WEAK FROM THE FEVER
ALL SERENE
CHEER-OH OLD CHAP SHE SAID
AND WHEN YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH SAID SHE AND THE HOUSE PURGED OF THE CONTAGION YOUR COUSINS FROM SUSSEX SHALL COME AND STAY A WHILE HERE WITH YOU AND AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL GO WITH THEM TO THEIR TOWN HOUSE AND SEE THE SIGHTS OF LONDON
IF THAT AIN'T THE NIPPER ALL OVER
YOU KNOW HOW I WENT AND LIVED IN KING JAMES'S TIME
EDRED'S HEART GAVE A SOFT UNCOMFORTABLE JUMP
THOU'RT A GOOD MODEST LAD SAID HIS FATHER WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR THIRD ROUND OF THE GARDEN NOT ONCE TO ASK FOR WHAT I PROMISED THEE DICKIE COULD NOT STAND THIS
YOU MIND AND LET IT BE THE LAST TIME YOU COME YOUR GAMES WITH ME MY BEAUTY
AND THE CHILDREN WORE THE DRESSES OF THAT TIME AND THE BOYS HAD LITTLE SWORDS AT THEIR SIDES
THEY HAD TAKEN HIS TINKLER FROM THE SAFE CORNER IN HIS BED WHERE THE TICKING WAS BROKEN AND THERE WAS A SOFT FLOCK NEST FOR A BOY'S BEST FRIEND
OH NO--NO I NEVER WELL YOU COME ALONGER ME
HE COULD NEVER HE WAS SURE HAVE GONE ON WITHOUT THAT GOOD COMPANION
SO HE ABANDONED THE WRITING OF POETRY DECIDING THAT IT WAS NOT HIS LINE AND PAINFULLY LEARNED THE DISMAL VERSES APPOINTED BY HIS TUTOR
EVERYTHING IN OUR MAGIC DEPENDED ON CLOTHES MINE DOESN'T
IT'S IN THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER DRAWER
TRAINED TO IT MR BEALE USED TO SAY SADLY WHENEVER HE TOLD THE STORY
TRAINED TO IT YE SEE
AND IF YOU LAY OUT YOUR MOON-SEEDS ROUND THEM IN THE OLD SHAPE AND STAND WITH THEM IN THE MIDST HOLDING YOUR TINKLER AND YOUR WHITE SEAL YOU WILL ALL GO WHITHERSOEVER YOU CHOOSE I SHALL CHOOSE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE TREASURE OF COURSE SAID PRACTICAL DICKIE SWINGING HIS FEET IN THEIR ROSETTED SHOES
PARROT-NOSE FOR SHORT DICKIE HASTENED TO ADD
HE HAS FORGOT SAID SIR RICHARD IN AN UNDERTONE WHAT IT WAS THAT THE GRANDFATHER PROMISED HIM
THREE DAYS LATER THE CRUTCH CLATTERED IN AT THE PAWNBROKER'S DOOR AND DICKIE LAID TWO MORE LITTLE BOXES ON THE COUNTER
THERE WAS ANOTHER SHARP THUNDER SOUND AND A FLASH LIKE LIGHTNING ONLY MUCH SMALLER
I'D CALL IT TRUE ONE OF THE DOGS IN MY DREAM WAS CALLED THAT
THY GRANDFATHER'S NAME GOT CHANGED BY BREATHING HARD ON IT FROM ARDEN TO HARDEN AND THAT AGAIN TO HARDING
OF COURSE WE MUST LOOK INTO THINGS BUT I FEEL NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT YOU ARE LORD ARDEN I DON'T WANT TO BE SAID DICKIE AND THAT WAS TRUE
WHAT A DREAM SAID DICKIE SHIVERING AND VERY SLEEPY
DON'T YOU THINK THAT DICKIE THOUGHT SEVERAL THINGS AND SHOOK THE OTHER'S HAND VERY HARD
IN THE HOSPITAL YOU WERE ALMOST TOO CLEAN
WHAT IS YOUR MAGIC EDRED ASKED
AND YOU SHALL BUY SOME MORE PUPS
BUT HE WASN'T SHAKEN OR PUT DOWN
I'LL PUT YOU IN THE VAN ALONG WITH THE OTHER HAMPERS WHISPERED JOE AS HE SHUT THE LID
THERE WERE HERRINGS FOR TEA
HAST THOU FORGOTTEN THAT
THE OTHER IS THE DREAM
GIRLS LIKE DOLLS AND TEA-PARTIES AND PICTURE-BOOKS BUT BOYS LIKE TO SEE THINGS MADE AND DONE
I WAS JUST A-LOOKING OUT FOR A NIPPER TO SHOVE THROUGH WINDOWS--SEE?--ALONG OF THAT REDHEADED CHAP WHAT YOU NEVER SET EYES ON I'VE KNOWN THAT A LONG TIME SAID DICKIE GRAVELY WATCHING THE CANDLE FLICKER ON THE BARE MANTEL-SHELF
HE WAS WAGONER'S MATE TO ONE OF LORD ARDEN'S MEN
IT'S A EASY JOB AS EVER I SEE
HE ONLY STOPPED EVERY NOW AND THEN TO SNEEZE AND BLOW AND THEN WENT ON DIGGING
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OTHER
DRINK UP THIS MILK"--SHE HAD IT READY IN A GLASS THAT SPARKLED IN A PATTERN--"AND THEN GO SOUND ASLEEP
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EXPLANATION A SHADOW FELL ON THE CHILDREN AND THE TINKLER AND THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE SEAL AND THERE WAS A BIG HANDSOME GENTLEMAN LOOKING DOWN AT THEM AND SAYING INTRODUCE YOUR FRIEND EDRED OH DICKIE THIS IS MY FATHER CRIED EDRED SCRAMBLING UP
AND WHO IS YOUR LITTLE FRIEND SHE ASKED EDRED AND IN THE SAME BREATH CRIED OUT--"WHY IT'S MY LITTLE RUNAWAY DICKIE ONLY SAID
OR WAS HE THAT BOY WITH THE OTHER NAME WHOSE FATHER WAS A KNIGHT AND WHO LIVED IN A HOUSE IN DEPTFORD WITH GREEN TREES OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS
I WON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS ONLY COME ALONG OUT OF IT
THANK YOU MY LAD SAID THE PAWNBROKER
YE COME ALONGER ME AN SEE LIFE
I HEARD THEM SNORING BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP LIE STILL SAID EDRED
WELL I'LL PUT ONE TO IT AND YOU LEG LONG AND BUY SEEDSES
SHE POINTED WITH THE BLUE BOX SHE HELD IN HER HAND
THEN HE SAW THE THREE GOLD BALLS ABOVE THE DOOR OF THE FRIENDLY PAWNBROKER
AND YOU COULD BRING THINGS THENCE
DICKIE PUT THIN ARMS ROUND HER NECK
BUT THEY HAD TO COME ON HANDS AND KNEES FOR THE PATH SLOPED STEEPLY UP AND THE OPENING WAS VERY LOW
HE WAS MY BIT OF WORK AND NOW SOME ONE ELSE COMES ALONG AND TAKES MY WORK OUT OF MY HANDS AND FINISHES IT
THE NIGHT IS FULL OF INTERESTING LITTLE SOUNDS THAT WILL NOT AT FIRST LET YOU SLEEP--THE RUSTLE OF LITTLE WILD THINGS IN THE HEDGES THE BARKING OF DOGS IN DISTANT FARMS THE CHIRP OF CRICKETS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS
NO EDRED HE HAS A RIGHT TO HEAR
HE HAD BEEN A VERY LONG TIME IN THE HOSPITAL AND IT WAS AUGUST NOW
NOW--ARE YOU READY TO DO WHAT IS TO BE DONE IT SEEMS VERY UNKIND TO DADDY SAID EDRED STOPPING HIS BEING LORD ARDEN AND EVERYTHING TO DO RIGHT OFTEN SEEMS UNKIND TO ONE OR ANOTHER SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP BUT THINK
PRIDE AND ANGER FILLED HIM
WHAT HE FELT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS I HAVE TRIED TO STICK TO BEALE AND HELP HIM ALONG AND I DID COME BACK FROM THE OTHER OLD LONG-AGO WORLD TO HELP HIM AND I HAVE BEEN STICKING TO THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE SO AS TO HELP HIM AND GET HIM SETTLED
I DO WONDER IF I CAN HE SAID
BUT I DON'T WANT TO TURN PEOPLE OUT--AND YOU KNOW EDRED CAME AND SAVED ME FROM THOSE PEOPLE
THE PLEASURE IS OURS SAID THE MOULDIERWARP INSTANTLY
AND THEN THERE ARE ALL THE COTTAGES TO REBUILD
HE TOUCHED THE STALK
AND THE TRAVELLERS WERE LUCKY
THE HOUSE WAS BY FAR THE FINEST HOUSE DICKIE HAD EVER BEEN IN AND THE GARDEN WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN THAN THE GARDEN AT TALBOT COURT
NOW YOU JUST SHUT UP I WANT TO THINK THIS UNUSUAL DESIRE QUITE AWED ELFRIDA
AND AS THESE PEOPLE WHO LOVED HIM WHO WERE HIS OWN DREW NEARER AND NEARER TO HIS HEART--HIS HEART QUICKENED BY LOVE OF THEM FELT ITSELF DRAWN MORE AND MORE TO MR BEALE
THEN YOU SAY IF YOU TAKE ME ALONG I PROMISE TO GIVE YOU ALL WHAT I EARNS OR GETS ANYHOW AND BE A GOOD BOY AND DO WHAT YOU SAY
LADY ARDEN CRIED ALL THE TIME AND AS DICKIE OWNED TO HIMSELF THERE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HER BUT EDRED WAS FULL OF HALF THOUGHT-OUT PLANS AND SCHEMES FOR BEING REVENGED ON OLD PARROT-NOSE
THE SIGHT PULLED AT DICKIE'S HEART-STRINGS
AND AFTER DINNER THE DEAR LADY-MOTHER MUST GO ALL OVER THE HOUSE TO SEE EVERYTHING BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY AND DICKIE WALKED IN THE GARDEN AMONG THE RIPE APPLES AND GRAPES WITH HIS FATHER'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER THE HAPPIEST PROUDEST BOY IN ALL DEPTFORD--OR IN ALL KENT EITHER
BUT WE TRUST YOU WON'T BE HARD ON US BECAUSE DICKIE IS LOST AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HIM THAT WAS THE BEST EDRED COULD DO AND I TELL IT TO HIS CREDIT HE REALLY DID FEEL DOUBTFUL WHETHER WHAT HE HAD SO SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY WRITTEN WAS INDEED GENUINE POETRY
AND HOWEVER YOU MAY SHUT PEOPLE UP BETWEEN BARS OF YELLOW AND MUD COLOR AND HOWEVER HARD YOU MAY MAKE THEM WORK AND HOWEVER LITTLE WAGE YOU MAY PAY THEM FOR WORKING THERE WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND AMONG THOSE PEOPLE SOME MEN WHO ARE WILLING TO WORK A LITTLE LONGER AND FOR NO WAGES AT ALL SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE GREEN THINGS GROWING NEAR THEM
I KNOW WHAT HE HAS DONE TO DO HONOR TO HIMSELF AND TO HELP OTHERS HEAR HEAR FROM BEALE I KNOW ALL HIS LIFE AND I AM PROUD THAT HE IS THE HEAD OF OUR HOUSE
YOU KNOW THAT OTHER DREAM OF MINE--THAT DREAM OF MINE I MEAN THE DREAM OF A DREADFUL PLACE AND THEN COULD I TAKE ANYTHING OUT OF THIS DREAM--I MEAN OUT OF THIS TIME INTO THE OTHER ONE YOU COULD BUT YOU MUST BRING IT BACK WHEN YOU COME AGAIN
THE CONFIDANT WAS A BLACKENED STICK ABOUT FIVE INCHES LONG WITH LITTLE BLACKENED BELLS TO IT LIKE THE BELLS ON DOGS COLLARS
THE SEEDS OF THE MOONFLOWER WERE LIKE THOSE
HIS GOOD LEG WAS TIRED AND STIFF AND HIS HEART TOO WAS VERY TIRED
WHILE HE WAS EXPLORING THE FOX-RUNS AMONG THE THICK STEMS OF THE GRASS MR BEALE LAY AT FULL LENGTH AND PONDERED
THEY CAME FROM THE TIME THAT YOU WERE BORN IN AND THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THIS TIME WITH YOU AND NOW THEY HAVE GONE BACK TO THEIR OWN TIME
NO--BUT LOOK ERE SAID DICKIE IF WE WAS TO TAKE A OUSE--JUST A LITTLE OUSE AND LET HALF OF IT WE AIN'T GOT NO STICKS TO PUT IN IT AIN'T THERE SOME WAY YOU GET FURNITURE WITHOUT PAYIN FOR IT IRE SYSTIM
I CAN'T TELL YOU HE SAID AT LAST ONLY I DON'T THINK I WANT TO BE LORD ARDEN
YOU SEE I WAS ALLUS A GREAT HANXIETY TO IM
I'VE GOT A KNIFE
AND THE MAN GREETED HIM AS AN OLD FRIEND KISSED HIM ON BOTH CHEEKS--WHICH HE DIDN'T EXPECT AND FELT MUCH TOO OLD FOR--AND SPREAD A SACK FOR HIM THAT HE MIGHT SIT IN THE SUN ON A BIG BAULK OF TIMBER
IT WAS OUR OWN OUSE YOU SEE YOU COME ALONG TO YER SUPPER SAID BEALE
SHE KNEW NOTHING BUT THAT THE CHILD'S CLOTHES WERE MARKED ARDEN AND THAT IT HAD TIED TO ITS WAIST A CORAL AND BELLS ENGRAVED WITH A COAT OF ARMS
PUT THEM UP IN THE BAG BOY
THE BAA OF THE SHEEP
I GOT TO GO THIS WAY AND HE WENT IT
ALL THE REST OF THE THINGS TOGETHER COST TWENTY-SIX SHILLINGS AND SEVENPENCE HALFPENNY AND I THINK THEY WERE CHEAP
THEN HE LIMPED UP TO NEW CROSS STATION AND STOOD OUTSIDE LEANING ON HIS CRUTCH AND HOLDING OUT THE FLOWERS TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAME CROWDING OUT OF THE STATION AFTER THE ARRIVAL OF EACH TRAIN--THICK BLACK CROWDS OF TIRED PEOPLE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO GET HOME TO THEIR TEAS TO CARE MUCH ABOUT HIM OR HIS FLOWERS
AND HE HATED THE MAN WHO TOOK THE HUTCH AWAY ALL THE MORE BECAUSE THERE WERE EMPTY RABBIT-SKINS HANGING SADLY FROM THE BACK OF THE BARROW
HE HAD BROUGHT EDRED AND ELFRIDA INTO DANGER AND HE COULD NOT GET THEM BACK AGAIN
THE GENTLEMAN MUST BE VERY STUPID HE THOUGHT NOT TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LICKING AND EATING
AND THEN BEALE AND ANOTHER MAN CAME WITH SPADES AND PRESENTLY THERE WAS THE ARCH AS GOOD AS EVER AND THEY EXCLAIMED AND ADMIRED AND WENT BACK TO THE CAVES
LOOK HERE YOU JUST COME AND LIVE ERE MELIA--SEE
MY FATHER WAS A YOUNGER SON--THE REAL HEIR WAS KIDNAPPED AND SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD SO I INHERITED
AMELIA WATCHED THEM DOWN THE STREET AND WAVED A FAREWELL AS THEY TURNED THE CORNER
I'M A CRIPPLE THEY CALL IT YOU SEE
DON'T SEEM UP TO MUCH
AND NOW DICKIE WAS LAME NO MORE
YET HE MUST GO
BUT DICKIE DID HIS BEST WITH WINDOW-BOXES AND EVERY WINDOW WAS UNDERLINED BY A BRIGHT DASH OF COLOR--CREEPING-JENNY BROMPTON STOCKS STONECROP AND LATE TULIPS AND ALL BOUGHT FROM THE BARROWS IN THE HIGH STREET MADE A BRAVE SHOW
WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE ME ON TRAMP WITH YOU
NOBODY WOULD LET ME RUN THEIR ERRANDS WHEN THEY COULD GET A BOY WITH BOTH LEGS TO DO THEM
A BOY HAD BROUGHT A BROWN RABBIT TO SCHOOL ONCE BUTTONED UP INSIDE HIS JACKET AND HE HAD LET DICKIE HOLD IT IN HIS HANDS FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE TEACHER DETECTED ITS PRESENCE AND SHUT IT UP IN A LOCKER TILL SCHOOL SHOULD BE OVER
HE WAS THROWN ON TO THE GROUND
DICKIE BOUGHT CARVING TOOLS AND WENT TO THE GOLDSMITHS INSTITUTE TO LEARN TO USE THEM
TWO HE SAID IN AWESTRUCK TONES
NOT MUCH YOU NEEDN'T MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT IT SAID ELFRIDA NOBODY'S GOING TO GET BRICKED UP IN VAULTS AND DICKIE ADDED YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT OLD CHAP
HE PREFERRED NOT TO THINK OF IT
DICKIE THOUGHT OF THE KITCHEN AT HOME THE LAMP THAT SMOKED THE DIRTY TABLE THE FENDER FULL OF ASHES AND DIRTY PAPER THE DRY BREAD THAT TASTED OF MICE AND THE WATER OUT OF THE BROKEN EARTHENWARE CUP
THIS IS A MAN'S JOB
YOU'RE OLDER THAN I AM SAID THE FIRST
AND HE IS LORD ARDEN YES SAID EDRED SUBMISSIVELY
AND TO THINK HE WAS ONLY A TRAMP
WHO LEARNED YOU THAT I LEARNED IT IN A DREAM SAID DICKIE SLOWLY
IT IS AN ADVENTURE FOR A BOLD KNIGHT
NOT WITH IM
KEEP YOUR OLD SECRETS AND LEFT HIM
HE JUST UNLATCHED THE GATE WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT--HIS HAND HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE WAY OF IT FOR ALL IT WAS SO LONG SINCE HE HAD PASSED THROUGH THAT GATE
AND HE HAD BORROWED IT ONCE
IT IS INDEED SHE ANSWERED
IT ONLY PAWNS FOR A SHILLING SAID DICKIE AND FARVER KNOWS WHAT STORE I SETS BY IT A SHILLIN'S A LOT I GRANT YOU THAT SAID BEALE EAGERLY
WITH THE UNERRING INSTINCT OF HIS RACE HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS NOT PLAY-ACTING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BEHIND IT--SOMETHING REAL
THEY CALLS EM COATS OF ARMS AND THEY PUT IT ON THEIR SILVER AND ON THEIR CARRIAGES AND THEIR FURNITURE PUT WHAT BEALE ASKED AGAIN
WELL HE HAD HELPED BEALE
SO HE TRIED THE TRUTH
LET'S HE SAID AGAIN
YOU'RE AS SNUG AS SNUG IN HERE SAID THE LANDLORD
AND ON THAT FIRST NIGHT OF HIS RETURN HE FOUND THAT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED
NO STICKS NO TRUST IS THE LANDLORD'S MOTTO DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT STICKS THEY BOUGHT
IT'S A FANCY BIT I WILL SAY HE OWNED
COME ALONG DOWN AND FETCH ME A HA'PORTH O WOOD--I CAN'T GET THE KETTLE TO BOIL WITHOUT A FIRE CAN I WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLIGHTLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY
WE GET OFF HERE IS THIS DEPTFORD DICKIE ASKED
YOU REMEMBER CAN'T SAY I DO SAID BEALE SCRATCHING HIS HEAD
BUT HE BEGGED THE NURSE TO LEAVE THE PANEL OPEN
DERE AIN'T NO TIME TO LOSE SO DICKIE WENT DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND CREPT DOWN THE MOLE TUNNEL OF SOFT SWEET-SMELLING EARTH AND THEN ALONG AND THEN UP--AND THERE THEY WERE IN THE COURTYARD
I'LL GO AND GET EM WHILE YOU CLEAN THE WINDERS
NIGH ON THIRTY MILE THANK YOU MISSIS SAID DICKIE AND SET OUT QUITE SIMPLY TO WALK THOSE MILES--NEARLY THIRTY
PERHAPS HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DREAM IT
BUT I AIN'T A-GOIN TO LEAVE YOU NOT YET I AIN'T
AND THERE WERE THE THREE CHILDREN AND TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL AND THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE SUNSHINE ON THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM IN THE TOWER
THE STREAM LEAPED OUT AND FLOWED RIGHT AND LEFT OVER THE DRY GRASS TILL IT LAPPED IN TINY WAVES AGAINST THEIR HILLOCK--"LIKE SAND CASTLES AS ELFRIDA OBSERVED
HE SEEMED TO SINK DEEP INTO A SOFT SEA OF SLEEP TO BE ROCKED ON ITS TIDE AND THEN TO BE FLUNG BY ITS WAVES ROUGHLY SUDDENLY ON SOME HARD SHORE OF AWAKENING
SO WHEN THE NURSE TOOK HIM TIRED WITH NEW HAPPINESSES TO THAT BEAUTIFUL TAPESTRIED ROOM OF HIS HE ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS GOOD SOFT SLEEPINESS TO SAY NURSE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS DON'T YOU I KNOW WHAT I KNOW SHE ANSWERED UNDOING BUTTONS WITH SPEED AND AUTHORITY
THE TREASURE WAS FOUND AND ITS HIDING-PLACE MARKED
WHEN HE AWOKE THERE WAS HIS OLD FRIEND THE STARRY SKY AND FOR A MOMENT HE WONDERED
BUT HE SAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND
AND I CAN'T THOU'RT BETTER HERE THAN IN THAT DREADFUL PLACE SAID THE NURSE STROKING HIS HAIR
AN ARDEN HE RUSHED TOWARDS THE SWAYING STAGGERING MELEE
AIN'T THERE NOTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO DO HE ASKED
I'M SORRY YOU'VE LOST THE DOG I AIN'T EXACTLY PLEASED MYSELF SAID BEALE BUT NO USE CRYING OVER BROKEN GLASS
THE WAY YOU TALK BEATS EVERYTHING
BEST NOT KNOW NOTHING
DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING
BUT JUST A LITTLE BOY RATHER BADLY FRIGHTENED
IT'S YOURN YOUR VERY OWN
SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE GONE AND DONE IT MATE
SHE MUST RECOGNIZE HIM
OR WAS THE OTHER THE DREAM AND IT SEEMED A FOOLISH QUESTION--WITH THE FEEL OF THE COARSE SHEETS AND THE SMELL OF THE CLOSE ROOM AND MR BEALE'S VOICE SAYING ROUSE UP NIPPER THERE'S SOSSINGERS FOR BREAKFAST CHAPTER V TO GET YOUR OWN LIVING NO SAID MR BEALE WE AIN'T A-GOIN TO CRACK NO MORE CRIBS
AND THEN WHEN THE LICK OF PAINT WAS NEARLY DRY ON THE PERAMBULATOR AND ALL THEIR SHIRTS AND SOCKS WERE WASHED AND MENDED AND LYING ON THE KITCHEN WINDOW-LEDGE READY FOR PACKING WHAT DID MR BEALE DO BUT GO OUT ONE MORNING AND COME BACK WITH A PERFECTLY STRANGE DACHSHUND
BUT SUPPOSE I JUST WORKED THE MAGIC AND WISHED TO BE WHERE THE TREASURE IS I WON'T CRIED EDRED AND IN HIS EXTREME DISLIKE TO THE IDEA HE KICKED WITH HIS BOOTS QUITE VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE STONES OF THE TOWER
COME ELFRIDA HE SAID AND HELD OUT HIS HAND
AND AS HE LAY AWAKE A GREAT RESOLVE GREW STRONG WITHIN HIM
ONLY I AIN'T
I WISH I MAY GO BACK TO JAMES THE FIRST'S TIME AND LIVE OUT MY LIFE THERE AND DO HONOR IN MY LIFE AND DEATH TO THE HOUSE OF ARDEN THE CHILDREN BLINKED
SO EVERYBODY CAN SEE EM
MY FATHER E BOUGHT ME A LITTLE COAT FOR WHEN IT WAS COLD OF A NIGHT LYING OUT LYING OUT
AND MY GIRL WILL NOT FORGET HOW TO FLING THE FLOWERS FROM THE GILT BASKET AS THE KING AND QUEEN COME DOWN THE STEPS THE GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE AND GARDEN--THE STATELY WHITE-HAIRED GRANDFATHER WHOM THEY CALLED MY LORD AND WHO WAS IT SEEMED THE AUNT'S FATHER--THE BANQUET THE PICTURE-GALLERY THE GARDENS LIT UP BY LITTLE COLORED OIL LAMPS HUNG IN FESTOONS FROM TREE TO TREE THE BLAZING TORCHES THE MUSIC THE MASQUE--A SORT OF PLAY WITHOUT WORDS IN WHICH EVERY ONE WORE THE MOST WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL DRESSES AND THE QUEEN HERSELF TOOK A PART DRESSED ALL IN GAUZE AND JEWELS AND WHITE SWAN'S FEATHERS--ALL THESE THINGS WERE LIKE A DREAM TO DICKIE AND THROUGH IT ALL THE WORDS KEPT ON SAYING THEMSELVES TO HIM VERY GENTLY VERY QUIETLY AND QUITE WITHOUT STOPPING GRAVESEND
HE HUNG INSIDE WITH HIS HANDS HOLDING THE BARS TILL HIS FOOT FOUND THE TABLE THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT JUST BELOW AND HE GOT FROM THAT TO THE FLOOR
DICKIE HAD JUST THROWN BACK HIS HEAD IN A LAUGH AT TRUE'S SULKY FACE AND STIFFLY PLANTED PAWS WHEN HE FELT THE OLD MAN'S DRY WRINKLED HAND UNDER HIS CHIN
DICKIE WAS TIRED AND THE FLOWERS WERE BEGINNING TO DROOP
I THOUGHT IT WAS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS TWENTY YEARS AGO--OR NEARER EIGHTEEN SAID SEBASTIAN
EVER SEED THE SEA NO SAID DICKIE
I WAS A WAGONER'S MATE WHEN I WAS A BOY
WHAT I DO SAY IS I WISH WE AD MORE ELBOW-ROOM FOR EM
THERE WAS A LAME BOY LIVED THERE ALONG OF THE LAST PARTY THAT HAD IT
SO THEY DID IT
THEN BEALE CAME WIPING HIS MOUTH AND THEY WALKED IDLY UP THE ROAD
DRAW UP A BUCKET IF THY LEG'LL LET THEE POOR LITTLE CHAP I DRAWS WATER WITH MY ARMS NOT MY LEGS SAID DICKIE CHEERFULLY
AND THERE WERE REINS IN HIS HAND--WHITE REINS
THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM HAD WHEELED HIM IN A PERAMBULATOR FOR MILES AND MILES THROUGH ENCHANTED COUNTRY
AND HE WON'T MIND AN EXTRY HAMPER MORE OR LESS
ONLY I CAN'T BUY IT BACK
YES BUT MUCH MORE THE SUDDEN GOOD SAFE FEELING OF FATHER AND MOTHER AND LITTLE BROTHER
DON'T EAT THE EGG-CUP HE SAID
I NEVER TOLD YOU A LIE DID I COME TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW AS YOU EVER DID BEALE ADMITTED
BECAUSE IT WAS THEN THAT DICKIE HAVING CALLED HIS AUNT A BEAST AND HIT AT HER WITH HIS LITTLE DIRTY FIST WAS WELL SLAPPED AND PUT OUT INTO THE BEREAVED YARD TO COME TO HIMSELF AS HIS AUNT SAID
I CAN'T THINK WHO IT IS THAT HE REMINDS ME OF
BUT TRUE RUSHED ABOUT THE HOUSE AND GARDEN WHINING AND YELPING SO PITEOUSLY THAT MELIA TIED HIM UP AND HE STAYED TIED UP
THAT'LL STAND TRUE AND LEGAL IN ANY POLICE-COURT IN ENGLAND THAT WILL
NOW HE SAID WHEN THE PATTERN WAS COMPLETE I SHALL HOLD TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL IN MY HAND AND TAKE THEM WITH ME
HE WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN OUT THE LINES HE FELT SURE HE WOULD NOT ONLY HE THOUGHT OF HIS COUSIN AND WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN
HE IS A WORTHIER ARDEN THAN THOSE LITTLE BLACK AND WHITE CHITS OF THINE THE MOULDIER SAID TO THE MOULDY WHICH IS WHAT TO SAVE TIME WE WILL NOW CALL THE MOULDIWARP AN SO SHOULD BE--AN SO SHOULD BE SAID THE MOULDY SHORTLY
THE EARL OF SCILLY CHID ME BUT THIS SUMMER FOR SPARING THE ROD AND SPOILING THE CHILD
NOW HE WOULD FIND EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND THEY WOULD GO BACK
WHAT AILS MY LAMB SHE ASKED
BESIDES YOU'VE GOT A REGULAR GIFT FOR STICKING IT ON--A TALENT I CALL IT
HE COULD NOT REMEMBER ANY HOUSE IN DEPTFORD THAT HAD GREEN TREES IN ITS GARDEN
SHE WAS TOOK BAD SUDDEN--A CHILL IT WAS AND STRUCK TO HER INNARDS
SAY YOU LOST YOUR FATHER IN THE TOWN AND THIS CHAP SAID HE KNEW WHERE E WAS AND IF YOU SEE ME YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AND SINCE THE PEOPLE IN BOOKS TALKED IN THIS NICE IF ODD WAY HE SAW NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT--TO A FRIEND WHOM HE COULD TRUST
THEY MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE WITH THE SACKING AND OLD PAPERS--BUT ONE AT LEAST OF THE TWO MISSED THE LUXURY OF CLEAN AIR AND SOFT MOSS AND A BED CANOPY STREWN WITH STARS
AND I'VE MADE AN ASS OF MYSELF FOR NOTHING WELL I'VE OFTEN MADE ONE OF MYSELF SAID ELFRIDA COMFORTINGLY AND I WILL AGAIN IF YOU LIKE
FOR BEFORE THE BOARD WAS COAXED QUITE BACK INTO ITS PLACE THE VOICE OF THE AUNT SCREAMED UP
HE FELT RATHER HEROIC
COME ON COME ON GOOD DOG SAID EDRED COME ON TRUE FOR HIS FANCY PICTURED DICKIE A PRISONER IN SOME LONELY COTTAGE AND HE LONGED TO GET TO IT AND SET HIM FREE AND GET SAFE BACK HOME WITH HIM
OR HAD HE AND MARKHAM IN THE HURRY OF THAT TWILIGHT DRESSING FORGOTTEN TO PUT IT ON
E'S A WUNNER AND NO BLOOMIN ERROR
PRIDE IN HIS OWN CLEVERNESS AND ANOTHER KIND OF PRIDE THAT MADE THAT CLEVERNESS SEEM SHAMEFUL
THIS INHERITED SENSE OF ROMANCE IN THE PAWNBROKER NOW LEAPED TO ANSWER DICKIE'S APPEAL
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
AND THE BROWN IS THE ROADS AND THE YELLOW IS THE HOUSES
OLD BEALE SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME
YOU MIGHT A-KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A PICKAXE SAID BEALE LATER SO HELP ME THREE MEN AND A BOY YOU MIGHT
AN IF THEY COMES ARTER YOU YOU SAY YOU'RE A-GOIN TO YOUR FATHER AT DOVER
COME ON WAIT A MINUTE SAID DICKIE NERVING HIMSELF TO THE TEST
WHAT AILS THE CHILD THE NURSE GRUMBLED
IT HAD WROUGHT ROSES ON IT AND DRINK ME AND DRINK AGAIN IN QUEER LETTERS ROUND THE RIM
BUT NOW THOU ART A MAN
YOU LIKED THE FLOWERS HE HANDED A GENEROUS SCORE ACROSS THE RED-BROWN POLISHED WOOD
AN THE NIPPER E SHALL WRITE IT ALL DOWN IN LEAD-PENCIL ON A BIT O PAPER FOR YOU WHAT THEY'RE TO AVE TO EAT AN ABOUT THEIR PHYSIC AND WHICH OF EM'S TO HAVE WHAT THIS TOOK SOME TIME TO SETTLE AND SOME MORE TIME TO WRITE DOWN
NOT BUT WHAT I SHOULD BE SORRY TO LEAVE THE OLD PLACE TOO
HE KNEW THE FUEL SHED WELL ENOUGH
OH HE CRIED ALOUD I'VE FOUND IT AGAIN!--I'VE FOUND IT!--I'VE FOUND IT AND THEN THE OLD NURSE WITH THE HOOPED PETTICOATS AND THE QUEER CAP AND THE WHITE RUFF WAS BENDING OVER HIM
INSTEAD THE LADY GATHERED HIM UP IN HER ARMS AND STOOD UP HOLDING HIM
THREE GENERATIONS AGO SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP A LITTLE BABY WAS STOLEN FROM ARDEN
CAUSE WHY
WANTED YOU
OH MOTHER HE SAID AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ALL HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD SPOKEN THAT WORD TO ANY ONE
HE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS WHEN HE HAD PUT THE GOLD THERE IN THAT OTHER LIFE
AND CAME VERY QUICKLY TO THE DOOR AND GOT HIS ARM ROUND DICKIE'S SHOULDERS
AND WHAT I SAY IS THE SOONER THE BETTER HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO MR BEALE AT ONCE FOUND A DOZEN REASONS WHY HE COULD NOT LEAVE HOME AND ALL THE REASONS WERE FOUR-FOOTED AND WAGGED LOVING TAILS AT HIM
AT ANY MOMENT HE MIGHT MEET HIS AUNT
BECAUSE HOWEVER KIND PEOPLE WERE THERE WAS ONE THING HE HAD TO DO--TO GET BACK TO THE GRAVESEND LODGING-HOUSE AS HIS FATHER HAD TOLD HIM TO DO
HE HEARD HER WORDS HERE
THAT'S VERY FLASH THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING SAID BEALE
I DO WANT TO SEE THEM BOTH SEE THEM HE DID IN A BLUE-GRAY MIST IN WHICH HE COULD FEEL NOTHING SOLID NOT EVEN THE GROUND UNDER HIS FEET OR THE TOUCH OF HIS CLENCHED FINGERS AGAINST HIS PALMS
AND DICKIE ADDED VERY QUICKLY MY NAME'S DICK HARDING IT TOOK LONGER FOR DICKIE TO GET UP BECAUSE OF THE CRUTCH AND LORD ARDEN REACHED HIS HAND DOWN TO HELP HIM
SHE WAS ONE OF THE SAME FAMILY YOU SEE DEAR DICKIE PUT HIS ARMS ROUND HER WAIST AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM AND LAID HIS HEAD ON HER SHOULDER
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW SAID EDRED STOLIDLY
WHAT CALL YOU GOT TO DO IT THE MAN SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND HESITATED
WHEN WE MET IN THE MAGIC TIMES I WAS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WASN'T I ELFRIDA HUGGED HIM AGAIN AND SAID NO MORE ABOUT THE FOOT
THEN THE CHAIN--HOLDING THE LOOSE LOOP OF IT IN HIS HAND SO THAT IT SHOULD NOT RATTLE HE SLIPPED ITS BALL FROM THE SOCKET
BUT HIS LIMBS WERE TOO STIFF
BECAUSE WITHOUT A SHILLING HE COULD NOT EXCHANGE THAT SQUARE OF CARDBOARD WITH RATTLE ON IT FOR HIS ONE FRIEND TINKLER
A GOOD DEAL OF OIL AND MORE PATIENCE WERE NEEDED BEFORE THE KEY CONSENTED TO TURN IN THE LOCK BUT IT DID TURN--AND THE LOW PASSAGE WAS DISCLOSED
AND HE WAS LAME BECAUSE HIS AUNT HAD DROPPED HIM WHEN HE WAS A BABY
BUT IT'LL TAKE TIME--PUT THY MONEY IN THE GREAT PRESS AND I'LL KEEP THE KEY
WHERE HAVE YOU PUT THE CRUTCH THEN THE OLD NURSE LAUGHED
OH THEY WERE SOMEWHERE ELSE--IN JULIUS CAESAR'S TIME TO BE EXACT--BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IT AND NEVER WILL KNOW IT
THE WIND BLEW FRESHLY AND THE RAGGED MAN FOUND A SHELTERED CORNER BEHIND THE FUNNEL
IT WAS LIKE THIS GOT BOX 4 BOX 4 BOX 4 BOX 4 DOG 40 DOG 14
YOU PROMISED TO GO THERE AS SOON AS YOU COULD
R
THE SMART PINK-FROCKED WHITE-CAPPED WHITE-APRONED MAID WHO UNSEEN BY DICKIE HAD BROUGHT THE BATH-WATER AND THE BATH CAME IN WITH A DUSTER
LET'S LAY IN THE OLD OUSE AIN'T I NEVER TO AVE NEVER A WORD WITH NOBODY WITHOUT IT'S YOU SAID BEALE BUT NOT ANGRILY
YOU'RE CLEVER ENOUGH FOR THIS POOR WORLD
SEE YOU NIPPER SAID BEALE SLOWLY AND FONDLY THE BEST DAY'S WORK EVER I DONE WAS WHEN I TOOK UP WITH YOU
TRUE FOLLOWED AT THE SLACK CHAIN'S END TILL THEY GOT TO THE MILESTONE AND THEN SUDDENLY HE DARTED AHEAD AND TOOK THE LEAD THE CHAIN STRETCHED TAUT AND THE BOY HAD ALL HIS WORK CUT OUT TO KEEP UP WITH THE DOG
THAT HE HAD DUTIES OF KINDNESS AND PROTECTION TO THE SERVANTS
NURSE SEEMED TO THINK
HE'S THE MAN I LIVE WITH
AND NOW YOU WANT TO THROW IT AWAY
I WAS SO AFRAID
YOU DO KNOW THINGS HE SAID
I'VE GOT SOMETHING ELSE HERE THAT'S GOT THE SAME CREST AS YOUR RATTLE CREST SAID DICKIE
WE CAN SEND FOR ANY OF THE DAWGS ANY MINUTE IF WE FEEL WE CAN'T STICK IT WITHOUT EM SAID BEALE SMOKING HIS PIPE IN THE FRONT GARDEN
THERE WAS A BRIGHT CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE AND VASES WITH CHRYSANTHEMUMS IN THEM AND THERE WERE RED WOOLLEN CURTAINS AS WELL AS THE WHITE LACE ONES
ALL THE NAMES IS DIFFERENT THERE
WHAT SAY MATE MR BEALE REPEATED
THE THINGS YOU THINK OF
HE WORKED HARDER THAN EVER AND WHEN BY THE LESSENING LIGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK ANY LONGER HE LAY BACK AGAINST A TREE ROOT TO REST HIS TIRED BACK AND TO GLOAT OVER THE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD MADE TWO BOXES IN ONE DAY--EIGHT SHILLINGS--IN ONE SINGLE DAY EIGHT SPLENDID SHILLINGS
SHE DIED IN THE INFIRMARY
TASN'T BEEN ARF A PANTO NEITHER
AND COME BACK AND SEE ME--SAY NEXT MONTH I WILL SAID DICKIE
AND IF YOUR GRAND SOCIETY FRIENDS GIVE YOU ANY MORE TREASURES YOU KNOW THE HOUSE TO COME TO--THE FAIREST HOUSE IN THE TRADE THOUGH I SAY IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID DICKIE
WE DON'T NEED TO CHEAT TO GET OUR LIVINGS NO NO DEAR BOY SAID MR BEALE MORE HASTILY STILL
FROM IT HE SAW A GARDEN BUT IT WAS NOT A GARDEN HE HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE
YOU'LL TAKE NO HARM AND WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP I WILL SAY THE RIGHT WORDS AND YOU'LL WAKE UNDER THE SAME SKIES AND NOT UNDER A BUILT HOUSE LIKE AS YOU FEARED SHE WRAPPED HIM IN A WARM CLOTH MANTLE OF HER OWN WHEN SHE TOOK HIM FROM HIS BED THAT NIGHT AFTER ALL THE FAMILY WERE ASLEEP AND PUT ON HIS SHOES AND LED HIM TO THE HOLE SHE HAD SECRETLY DUG IN BELOW THE WINDOW
AND NOW DICKIE LOVED BEALE MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE FOR HIM HE HAD SACRIFICED HIS DREAM
WELL WELL I'D MUCH RATHER NOT SAID DICKIE SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I LOVE IT VERY MUCH
SEE HIM DICKIE SAW AND THE CROWN WAS SET ON HIS HAPPINESS
NOW THEN LET ME GO AHEAD WITH THE CHISEL EDRED LET HIM
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW WONDERFUL IT SEEMS JUST AT FIRST YOU KNOW NOT TO BE LAME CHAPTER VI BURIED TREASURE AND THEN AS HE STOOD THERE IN THE SUNSHINE HE SUDDENLY KNEW
THOU SILLY BOY
IT'LL BE A BIT LONESOME SHE SAID
THEN VERY GENTLY HE TURNED THE HANDLE AND PULLED--AND THE DOOR OPENED AND HE CREPT FROM BEHIND IT AND FELT THE COOL SWEET AIR OF THE NIGHT ON HIS FACE
IT ALMOST LOOKED DICKIE THOUGHT AS THOUGH HE HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT FOR SOME SPECIAL PURPOSE
DON'T YOU TAKE IT OUT TILL TO-MORROW AND IT'LL BE STUCK FAST
AND THE LADY STOOD UP WITH THE BABE IN HER ARMS
IT WAS MARKHAM WHO WAS TOLD TO WASH DICKIE'S HANDS WHEN THE DRIVE WAS OVER AND MARKHAM WAS THE ENEMY WITH THE CLEVER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
IT WILL COST YOU MORE TO DO IT THAN IT WOULD COST ELFRIDA BECAUSE SHE IS BRAVER THAN YOU ARE HERE WAS A NICE THING FOR A BOY TO HAVE SAID TO HIM AND BEFORE ALL THESE PEOPLE TOO
AND HE WAS ASLEEP OVER THE SAME ENTERTAINING WORK WHEN LORD ARDEN CAME THE NEXT AFTERNOON
HE HAD NOT FALLEN A COUPLE OF YARDS BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT BY SOMETHING SOFT AS HEAPED FEATHERS OR DRIFTED SNOW
WOULD THEY REMEMBER THAT HE AND THEY HAD BEEN COUSINS AND FRIENDS WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING
SOMETIMES I FEEL AS IF I SIMPLY COULDN'T BEAR IT YOU DEAR CHILD SHE SAID
YOU'RE HERE AT HOME IN THE BEST BED IN YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE AT DEPTFORD
HE TREMBLED ALL OVER
AN HE'S A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MINE
AND AS ON THAT OTHER NIGHT EVERYTHING GREW VERY QUIET AND SLEEP WRAPPED DICKIE ROUND LIKE A SOFT GARMENT
BUT EDRED AND ELFRIDA WORRIED AND BOTHERED IN A PERFECTLY GENTLE AND POLITE WAY TILL AT LAST A VERY JOLLY GENTLEMAN IN SPECTACLES WHO CAME DOWN TO SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS TOOK THEIR PART
TO-MORROW THY FATHER AND MOTHER COME HOME AND THY BABY-BROTHER AND TO-DAY SENNIGHT THY LITTLE COUSINS COME TO VISIT THEE HOW PERFECTLY GLORIOUS SAID DICKIE
THERE WERE RED ROOFS AT ONE SIDE OF THE CASTLE WHERE A HOUSE HAD BEEN BUILT AMONG THE RUINS
DEAR SIR
TINKLER AND THE MOONFLOWER 1 II
LET'S AVE A LOOK AT YOU HE SAID AND PEERED CLOSELY AT THE CHILD
SUDDENLY TRUE PAUSED SNIFFED SNEEZED BLEW THROUGH HIS NOSE AND BEGAN TO DIG
THE SWAN GLIDED AWAY BETWEEN SNOW AND STARS AND ON THE LANDING INSIDE THE OPEN WINDOW THE NURSE HELD HIM FAST IN HER ARMS
HERE WARD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING FIRST GO OFF DON'T YOU WORRY SAID BEALE
AND THE HALFPENNY CLUTCHED TIGHT AND CLOSE IN HIS HAND SEEMED TO REPROACH HIM WARMLY
I KNEW IT WAS NO GOOD EDRED SAID CROSSLY
I WORK THE MAGIC OF SPACE MY BROTHER HERE WORKS THE MAGIC OF TIME AND THE GREAT MOULDIESTWARP CONTROLS US AND MANY THINGS BESIDE
MOTHER DO LET ME HOLD HIM A WARM STIFF BUNDLE WAS PUT INTO HIS CAREFUL ARMS AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER INSTANTLY CAUGHT AT HIS HAIR
THAT WOULD BE HIS BREAKFAST WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED CRYING AFTER HIS AUNT HAD SLAPPED HIM
GOOD-BYE ELFRIDA HE KISSED HER
NO ONE NOTICED HIM AS HE CAME DOWN THE STREET VERY CLOSE TO THE RAILINGS
BUT ON THE THIRD DAY HE ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GETTING THE FIDGETS IN HIS LEGS
HE GOT OUT THE KNIFE THAT SHOULD HAVE CUT THE STRING OF THE BASKET IN THE TRAIN OPENED IT AND CUT THE STALK OF THE MOONFLOWER VERY CAREFULLY SO THAT NONE OF THE SEEDS SHOULD BE AND ONLY A FEW WERE LOST
AND HE LEFT HER
WE OOFED IT UP NOT TO WASTE OUR LITTLE BIT AND HE'S A HOPPY CHAP THAT'S ODD SAID THE LANDLORD
HE CAME CLOSE TO WHERE LORD ARDEN STOOD--A TALL DARK FIGURE IN THE STARLIGHT--AND SPOKE IN A VOICE THAT TREMBLED
THE AIR WAS FULL OF SHOUTING AND THE SOUND OF GUNS AND THE CLASH OF ARMOR AND A SHATTERING SOUND LIKE A GIANT MALLET STRIKING A GIANT DRUM--A SOUND THAT CAME AND CAME AGAIN AT FIVE-MINUTE INTERVALS--AND THE SHRIEKS OF WOUNDED MEN
WILL YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME THE MOULDIERWARP IN THE MAGIC-LANTERN PICTURE SEEMED TO SCRATCH HIS NOSE THOUGHTFULLY WITH HIS FORE PAW
THE CHILDREN READ IT EVERY SUNDAY FOR A YEAR AND KNEW THAT IT DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH
AND IT WAS FUN EATING AGREEABLE AND UNUSUAL THINGS LYING DOWN IN THE ROOMY HAMPER AMONG THE SMOOTH STRAW
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP
IT ALWAYS DOES UPSET EVERYTHING
AH I THOUGHT SHE AD SAID THE MAID TRIUMPHANTLY
THEN CAME LOTS OF PLATE ARMOR FOR CHEST AND ARMS
HE SIGHED
THE FLOOR WAS OF DARK WOOD STREWN STRANGELY WITH FLOWERS AND GREEN HERBS AND THE BED WAS A FOUR-POST BED LIKE THE ONE HE HAD SLEPT IN AT TALBOT HOUSE
HE OPENED HIS EYES
WHAT WITH BEALE AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER THAT WAS THE MAN YOU RAN AWAY FROM ME TO GO TO YES SAID DICKIE GRAVELY
WHAT IF WE WAS TO TAKE THE ROAD A BIT MATE--WHERE THERE'S ROOM TO STRETCH A CHAP'S LEGS WITHOUT KICKIN A DOG OR KNOCKIN THE CROCKERY OVER
WHAT'S THE FARE TO GRAVESEND DON'T KNOW
THEY LOOKED FOR DICKIE TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND HERE AND THERE UNDER BUSHES AND BY STILES AND HEDGES AND WITH TREMBLING HEARTS THEY SEARCHED IN THE LITTLE OLD CHALK QUARRY AND THE WHITE MOON CAME UP VERY LATE TO HELP THEM
THERE ARE SO MANY BOYS IN THE STREETS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
THE BOY WHO HAD KILLED A CROMWELL'S MAN WITH HIS LITTLE SWORD HAD NOT BEEN LAME
AND NOW FOR SEVEN MONTHS WORK AND NOT ONE GOOD DREAM SAID DICKIE GOT UP PUT TINKLER AND THE SEAL AND THE MOON-SEEDS INTO A VERY SAFE PLACE AND CREPT BACK TO BED
CHAPTER III THE ESCAPE WHEN LADY TALBOT LEANED OVER THE SIDE OF THE BIG BED TO AWAKEN DICKIE HARDING SHE WISHED WITH ALL HER HEART THAT SHE HAD JUST SUCH A LITTLE BOY OF HER OWN
BUT AUNT MAUD HAD FOUND THAT AND TAKEN IT AWAY TO TAKE CARE OF AND HE HAD NEVER SEEN IT AGAIN
AND NOW ALL DICKIE'S LITTLE SOUL WAS FILLED WITH ONE LONGING
AVE I BIN RUN OVER AGEN
HE'LL BE ANXIOUS IF I DON'T SHALL I HURT YOU IF I PUT YOU ON MY BACK LORD ARDEN ASKED AND NEXT MINUTE HE WAS CARRYING DICKIE DOWN THE SLOPE TOWARDS ARDEN CASTLE WHILE EDRED WENT BACK TO BEALE'S COTTAGE TO SAY WHERE DICKIE WAS
I'M A-GOIN TO AVE A HAUCTION I AM HE SAID TO THE COMPANY AT LARGE
SOMEHOW OR OTHER DICKIE MUST GET TO GRAVESEND TO THAT HOUSE WHERE THERE HAD BEEN A BATH OR SOMETHING LIKE IT IN A PAIL AND WHERE KINDLY TRAMP-PEOPLE HAD TOASTED HERRINGS AND GIVEN APPLES TO LITTLE BOYS WHO HELPED
HOW COULD HE GET OUT
HE DID NOT KNOW
AND FOR NO REASON THAT HE COULD HAVE GIVEN HE BEGAN TO CRY
COUNT IT OUT SHE SAID TAKING HER BABE FROM HIM
HE WENT OUT INTO THE STREET AND ASKED THE FIRST GOOD-NATURED-LOOKING LOAFER HE SAW THE WAY TO GRAVESEND
AND BY HIS EQUALS
TURNS THE LADIES ROUND IS FINGER AS EASY AS KISS YER AND
IS IT COUNTRY WHERE YOU GOING SAID DICKIE LOOKING AT THE GREEN HEDGE
THIS ERE'S MY TINKLER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WHAT PAWNS FOR A BOB
HE HAD NOT READ DON QUIXOTE AS YOU NO DOUBT HAVE
COME ALONG DOWN CAN'T YOU
WE EARNS OUR LIVINGS
OUT WITH IT FARVER IT AIN'T NOTHING SAID MR BEALE
LADY TALBOT WAS VERY CHARMING TO THE CHILDREN PLAYED HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH THEM AND GAVE THEM A DELIGHTFUL AND VARIED TEA IN THE YEW ARBOR
THAT'S WHAT FOR RATS SAID DICKIE BRIEFLY
NOW ATTEND CAREFULLY
SOMETHING MOVED INSIDE AND A CHAIN RATTLED
WHERE'S THE KID E'S THERE AWAITIN FOR ME SAID BEALE
UNCLES AND AUNTS AN A LITTLE BROTHER
UP THE HILL THEY WENT ON TO THE DOWNS AND IN AND OUT AMONG THE FURZE BUSHES
WHAT IS IT DEAR
PUT YER CLOBBER UNDER YER BOLSTER LIKEWISE YER BOOTS WAS THE LAST INSTRUCTION OF HIS NEW FRIEND AND FATHER THERE HAD BEEN A BATH--OR SOMETHING EQUALLY CLEANSING--IN A PAIL NEAR A FIRE WHERE RAGGED BUT AGREEABLE PEOPLE WERE COOKING HERRINGS SAUSAGES AND OTHER DELICACIES ON LITTLE GRIDIRONS OR PANS THAT THEY UNROLLED FROM THE STRANGE BUNDLES THAT WERE THEIR LUGGAGE
IT'S NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS BEFORE
AND SO WHEN EDRED AND ELFRIDA CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST MRS HONEYSETT MET THEM WITH THE NEWS THAT DICKIE WAS LOST AND THEIR FATHER STILL OUT LOOKING FOR HIM
IF WE TELL YOU SAID ELFRIDA EXPLAINING AFFECTIONATELY YOU WON'T BELIEVE US YOU MIGHT AT LEAST SAID RICHARD ARDEN CATCHING DESPERATELY AT THE GRAND MANNER THAT SEEMED TO SUIT THESE TIMES OF RUFF AND SWORD AND CLOAK AND CONSPIRACY--"YOU MIGHT AT LEAST MAKE THE TRIAL VERY WELL I WILL SAID ELFRIDA ABRUPTLY
THEY CAME ON LOOKING HARD AT HIM--THE SEVERE MIGHT HAVE CALLED IT STARING--LOOKED CAME UP TO HIM AND PASSED BY WITHOUT A WORD
ONLY FOR THAT YOU'D HAVE TO MEET THEM IN YOUR OWN TIME THAT YOU WERE BORN IN AND YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL IT'S SUMMER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE NOW
WE ARE TO STAY A MONTH
YOU'RE JUST LIKE THE GREEK ORACLES
BECAUSE GOING ALONG TO SCHOOL WITH HIS SILLY LITTLE HEAD FULL OF ARTISTIC BIRD SEEDS AND FLOWERS RAINBOW-COLORED HE HAD LET HIS CRUTCH SLIP ON A BANANA-SKIN AND HAD TUMBLED DOWN AND A BUTCHER'S CART HAD GONE OVER HIS POOR LAME FOOT
A REAL LIVE BIRD
FOR HIS NURSE HAD TOLD HIM THAT HIS FATHER WAS A RICH MAN
ABOUT HIM WERE THE TAPESTRY WALLS AND THE HEAVY FURNITURE OF THE DREAM
COURSE WE DON'T
WELL YOUNG MAN SAID THE STOUT GENTLEMAN BEHIND THE COUNTER WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU I WANT TO PAWN MY MOONFLOWERS SAID DICKIE
IT WAS A VERY LONG TIME INDEED BEFORE HE CAME BACK
COME IN SAID THE OLD MAN
BUT PRESENTLY A LIGHT SHOWED AHEAD AND NEXT MOMENT THERE THEY WERE IN THE CAVE AND STEPPED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE ON THE EXACT SPOT WHERE DICKIE HAD SET OUT THE MOON-SEEDS AND TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL
ONLY THE TURNING OF THE KEY REMAINED AND DICKIE ACCOMPLISHED THAT WITH BOTH HANDS FOR IT WAS A BIG KEY KNEELING ON HIS ONE SOUND KNEE
YOU'D MAKE A TIDY BIT ON THE ALLS SAID BEALE QUITE AWESTRUCK
I WASN'T NO GOOD--I DON'T DECEIVE YOU GUV'NER--A NO ACCOUNT MAN I WAS SWELP ME
NOT SO DUSTY SAID MR BEALE CAUTIOUSLY
THOUGHT YOU WAS MY AUNT
COME I'LL MAKE YOU A FAIR OFFER
MR ROSENBERG SAID THE SLENDER LADY--"OH DO COME HERE PLEASE
IT'S SO SPLENDID ALL THE THINGS THE ARDENS DID--IN HISTORY YOU KNOW
THEIR FEELINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT WHEN THEY PEEPED THROUGH THE HOLE WHERE DICKIE AND EDRED HAD REMOVED TWO MORE STONES AND SAW THE DUSTY GRAY OF THE WOODEN DOOR BEYOND
THEN ALL THE GALLEYS FELL INTO PLACE BEHIND THE KING'S BARGE AND THE LONG BEAUTIFUL PROCESSION WENT SLOWLY ON DOWN THE RIVER
I LAY IF HE'S ALIVE IT UD BE AS GOOD AS THREE SUNDAYS IN THE WEEK TO HIM TO SEE YOU
THUS NAMES ARE CHANGED EVER AND AGAIN
OH THAT WAS JUST AN ADDRESS MR BEALE MADE UP TO LOOK GRAND WITH SAID DICKIE
THEY GOT QUITE CLOSE TO IT BEFORE THE SHELTER OF THE TREES ENDED FOR A LITTLE WOOD LAY BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE HOUSE
I SEE HIM A TALL YOUTH STRAIGHT AND STRONG LENDING THE OLD NURSE HIS ARM TO WALK IN THE TRIM BEAUTIFUL GARDEN AT DEPTFORD
HE COULD SEE THE MEN-AT-ARMS CROWDING IN THE ARCHWAY OF THE GREAT GATE TOWER
FOR THERE WERE LESSONS NOW WITH A SOUR-FACED TUTOR IN A BLACK GOWN WHOM DICKIE DISLIKED EXTREMELY
NO FLOWERS WOULD GROW IN THE GARDEN NOW TRAMPLED HARD BY THE INDIA-RUBBER-SOLED FEET OF MANY DOGS
WHY SAID DICKIE IT'S YOU WHO WOULD IT BE BUT ME LITTLE MASTER THE MAN ASKED WITH A RESPECTFUL SALUTE AND DICKIE PERCEIVED THAT THOUGH THIS MAN HAD THE FACE OF THE MAN NEXT DOOR HE HAD NOT THE MAN NEXT DOOR'S MEMORIES
A GREAT UNDERTAKING FOR A CHILD
AND DON'T YOU FORGET YOU'RE MY NIPPER AND YOU GOT TO CALL ME DADDY I'LL CALL YOU FARVER SAID DICKIE
WELL YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE OUT OF IT SHE SAID
I'M A-GOIN TO TRAMP AS FAR AS BRIGHTON AND BACK ALL ALONGSIDE THE SEA
THE TONGUE WAS THE EASIEST
HE FELT THIS SO MUCH THAT HE TRIED TO WRITE A POEM HIMSELF AND GOT AS FAR AS THEY SAY THERE IS NO OTHER CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF MOTHER
HO NO
LOOK IN MY EYES EDRED LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THE MOULDIESTWARP AND SAW THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER A MOLE'S EYES BUT WERE LIKE THE EYES OF ALL THE DEAR PEOPLE HE HAD EVER KNOWN AND THROUGH THEM THE SOUL OF ALL THE BRAVE PEOPLE HE HAD EVER READ ABOUT LOOKED OUT AT HIM AND SAID COURAGE EDRED
IT DIDN'T COST SO VERY MUCH
MRS HONEYSETT CAME IN EXCLAIMED AT HIS WHITE FACE FELT HIS HANDS SAID HE WAS IN A HIGH FEVER AND PUT HIM TO BED WITH WET RAGS ON HIS FOREHEAD AND HOT-WATER BOTTLES TO HIS FEET
I GOT THE PLAN DRAWED OUT
IT'S NOT CHEEK
HIS EYES HAD GOT USED TO THE GENTLE STARLIGHT AND HE FOLLOWED THE DOG AMONG THE GORSE AND BRAMBLES WITHOUT STUMBLING AND WITHOUT HURTING HIMSELF AGAINST THE MILLION SHARP SPEARS AND THORNS
BUT THY GROWTH IN ALL THINGS BEARS OUT IN WHAT I ANSWERED HIM
I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN DO IT HE SAID
ALSO HE SIGHED HEAVILY
BUT YOUR MAGIC WILL HOLD
BUT THERE'S A MAN WAITING THERE FOR ME THAT WAS GOOD TO ME WHEN I WAS--WHEN I WASN'T
LADY TALBOT SHOOK HANDS WITH THE OTHERS AND THEN TURNED TO HIM
THERE ARE THREE WHITE MOULDIWARPS FRIENDS TO THY HOUSE SHE TOLD HIM--"THE MOULDIWARP WHO IS THE BADGE AND THE MOULDIWARP WHO IS THE CREST AND THE GREAT MOULDIWARP WHO SITS ON THE GREEN AND WHITE CHECKERED FIELD OF THE ARDENS SHIELD OF ARMS
DICKIE WAS LEFT IN THE LANE LOOKING AFTER THEM
THE RIGGING LOOKED FAMILIAR BUT THE SHAPE OF THE SHIPS WAS QUITE DIFFERENT
A BIT OF ALL RIGHT I CALL IT THEY WENT ON UP THE HILL AS HAPPY AS ANY ONE NEED WISH TO BE
WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE
AND I'LL CARVE OUR ARMS ON THE TOP--SEE I'VE LEFT THAT BIT STICKIN UP A PURPOSE IT WAS THE HARDEST DAY'S WORK DICKIE HAD EVER DONE
YOU OR I MORE POLITE IF LESS PICTURESQUE WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SAID TWO CUPS OF TEA FOUR EGGS AND SOME THICK BREAD AND BUTTER IT WAS A PLEASANT MEAL
AND WANTING TO FIND DICKIE ISN'T NOBLE NO SHE AGREED
DERE'S NAUGHT TO BE AFEARED ON LORD ARDEN AM I REALLY LORD ARDEN SAID DICKIE PAUSING
TIS THE FEVER THE MOTHER PUT THE BAG IN DICKIE'S HANDS
THERE'S A BIT OF THE SOFER LEG LEFT AIN'T THERE THERE WAS AND DICKIE WORKED AWAY AT IT IN THE ODD MOMENTS THAT CLUSTER ROUND MEAL TIMES THE HALF-HOURS BEFORE BED AND BEFORE THE MORNING START
IT IS A MONTH SINCE YOU WENT AWAY BUT I THOUGHT TIME DIDN'T MOVE--I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MONEY UPSET EVERYTHING SHE SAID
I WANT COMPANY
EDRED OBEYED AND THE MOULDIESTWARP LEANED TOWARDS HIM AND SPOKE IN HIS EAR FRONTISPIECE PAGE 260 HARDING'S LUCK BY E
AND YOU HAVE A BABY BROTHER RICHARD THEN SAID DICKIE I THINK I WILL STAY HERE AND TRY TO REMEMBER WHO I AM--I MEAN WHO YOU SAY I AM--AND NOT TRY TO DREAM ANY MORE ABOUT NEW CROSS AND MR BEALE
IT WAS MAHOGANY I DREAMED I MADE MY BOX WITH SAID DICKIE
SO LONG AS THE WEATHER HOLDS WE'LL SLEEP IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS AND I'LL AVE A GREEN WOOD FOR MY WORKSHOP AND WHEN THE NIGHTS GET COLD WE'LL RENT A ROOM OF OUR VERY OWN AND LIVE LIKE TOFFS WON'T US THE CHILD'S EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT
WHY--IT'S A CHILD SOME MORE PEOPLE WERE COMING DOWN THE STAIRS WITH CANDLES AND EXCITED VOICES
AS THEY PASSED DOWN THE QUIET DUSTY ROAD BEALE SPOKE AGAIN
ALL WAS DARK EVEN PANELLING
AND HE HAD ADVENTURES--NO END OF ADVENTURES--AS YOU WILL SEE PRESENTLY
BETTER ASKED A LADY
THE LITTLE HORSE--THE GOLD PIECES
BUT THEY HAD NOT THOUGHT IT THEIR PLACE TO TALK ABOUT SUCH THINGS AND I SUSPECT THAT IN THEIR HEARTS THEY DID NOT MORE THAN HALF BELIEVE THEM
I WOULDN'T SHOW IT TO NO ONE BUT YOU SWELP ME I WOULDN'T HE HELD THE RATTLE OUT
HIS ANGER HAD LED HIM TO DEFY THE ROUNDHEADS AND TO GRATIFY HIS HATE OF THEM HE HAD SACRIFICED THOSE TWO WHO TRUSTED HIM
THE ELEPHANT AND CASTLE MARKS BUT A VERY SHORT STAGE OF THE WEARY WAY BETWEEN LONDON AND GRAVESEND
SHE WAS NOT A NICE WOMAN AND I AM GLAD TO SAY THAT SHE GOES OUT OF THIS STORY ALMOST AT ONCE
THEY WERE SHORTER AND BROADER THAN THE SHIPS THAT DICKIE HARDING HAD BEEN USED TO SEE AND THEY MOST OF THEM ROSE UP MUCH HIGHER OUT OF THE WATER
WITH--WITH MONEY MATE--WITH MONEY OF COURSE HOW'D YOU GET IT NO ANSWER
WHEN DICKIE HAD LEARNED AS MUCH ABOUT DOGS AS HE FELT HE COULD BEAR FOR THAT DAY HE FELT FREE TO GO DOWN TO THE DOCKYARD AND GO ON LEARNING HOW SHIPS WERE BUILT
YOU'LL TRUST ME LOOKS LIKE IT SAID THE JEW
CERTAIN THINGS
PRETTY AIN'T THEY ONE BLACK-COATED PERSON WOULD SAY TO ANOTHER
THE MEN HAD LONG HAIR AND THE KIND OF CLOTHES YOU KNOW WERE WORN WHEN CHARLES THE FIRST WAS KING
IT'S TEA-TIME
I'LL MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH THE GUARD
BE ONE OF US NOW LOOK AT THE PEOPLE ON THE HALL SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP
HE DREW UP THE DRIPPING OAKEN BUCKET FROM THE COOL DARKNESS OF THE WELL FETCHED THE MUG AND OFFERED IT BRIMMING TO THE OLD MAN
BUT HE DID NOT SEE THE CHILDREN
AND AS HE CAME DOWN OFF THE THRONE THE GREAT ONES CROWDED ROUND HIM CLASPING HIS HAND AND SAYING BE ONE OF US EDRED
EDRED DO HE GAVE HER THE PAPER
I DON'T REMEMBER THEM
BUT HE NEVER FOUND TINKLER
THEY WILL BE BOUGHT BACK
BUT FARVER E'S VERY GOOD TO ME
I THOUGHT IT UD COME INTO FLOWERS LIKE BIRDS--SAME COLORS AS WOT THE POLL PARROT WAS DONTCHERKNOW AND SO IT WILL LIKE AS NOT SAID THE MAN NEXT DOOR COMFORTABLY
SLOWER THAN THE SOUL OF YOU MY LAMB
NEXT MORNING MR BEALE COMING DOWN-STAIRS WAS JUST IN TIME TO BANG THE FRONT DOOR IN THE FACE OF AMELIA COMING IN PAIL-LADEN FROM DOING THE STEPS AND THIS TO PREVENT THE FLIGHT OF THE NEW DOG
DEAR DICKIE AND IF HE'S REALLY DOWN A MINE OR THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ANYTHING I'M GOING TO TRY ANYWAY SAID EDRED AT LEAST YOU MUST TOO
THE CHILDREN SAT DOWN ON THE STEP OF ONE OF THE STONE SEATS AND DICKIE WAS WONDERING WHY HE HAD FELT THAT QUEER CLOCK-STOPPING FEELING WHEN HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS WONDERINGS BY HEARING ELFRIDA SAY PLEASE TO REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER THE GUNPOWDER TREASON AND PLOT
YOU ARE A LITTLE NIPPER HE SAID AFFECTIONATELY
BUT E'S NEVER LET IT OUT OH STOW IT SAID THE OTHER IMPATIENTLY
SO OUT WITH YOU
BECAUSE OF COURSE SOME ONE ELSE MIGHT TAKE THE HOUSE AND FIND THE TREASURES
THAT'S A BROWNIE IF YOU'VE DREAMED ABOUT OUR TIME SAID ELFRIDA
AND NOT NICK ANYTHING NOT A BLOOMIN THING SAID HE
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GUESS WHAT HE CAME ABOUT
FOR IT SEEMED THAT ALL THESE NICE PEOPLE WERE ON THE ROAD AND THIS PLACE WHERE THE KITCHEN WAS AND THE GOOD COMPANY AND THE CLEAN BED FOR FOURPENCE WAS A TRAMPS HOTEL--ONE OF MANY THAT ARE SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY AND CALLED COMMON LODGING-HOUSES THE SINGING AND LAUGHING WENT ON LONG AFTER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND IF LATER IN THE EVENING THERE WERE LOUD-VOICED ARGUMENTS OR QUARRELS EVEN DICKIE DID NOT HEAR THEM
WE GOT TO LIVE IN THE DREAM SAID DICKIE THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE NO UNEMPLOYED
AND WITH THE SHILLING HE COULD
NO ONE COULD HOPE TO DIG UP A BIG THING LIKE THAT FROM HIS BACK GARDEN WITHOUT ATTRACTING SOME ATTENTION
HE WOULD TRY ONCE MORE THE MAGIC OF THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE RATTLE AND THE WHITE SEAL AND TRY TO GET BACK INTO THAT OTHER WORLD
IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WITH THE STEAMBOAT GOING ALONG IN SUCH A HURRY PUSHING THE WATER OUT OF THE WAY AND PUFFING AND BLOWING AND SOMETHING BEATING INSIDE IT LIKE A GIANT'S HEART
I'LL GIVE YOU FOUR BOB FOR EVERY ONE OF THEM YOU MAKE AND BRING TO ME
THEN HE REMEMBERED
AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS MORE FOOD AND MORE SLEEP AND NIGHTS AND DAYS AND TALKS AND SILENCES AND VERY GRADUALLY YET VERY QUICKLY DICKIE LEARNED ABOUT THIS NEW BOY WHO WAS AND WASN'T HIMSELF
YOU IS FATHER SAID THE LANDLORD SHARPLY
AND I VOTE WE GO AND LOOK FOR IT
SWAN CARRIAGES CAN TAKE YOU FROM ONE TIME TO ANOTHER JUST AS WELL AS ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER
A FOOL AND HIS MONEY'S SOON PARTED'S WHAT I SAY
THE SEEDS LAY VERY FLAT AND FITTED CLOSE TOGETHER
DOST MEAN TO TELL ME THE FEVER HAS MAZED THY POOR BRAINS TILL THOU DON'T KNOW THAT THY NAME'S RICHARD AND DICKIE HEARD HER NAME A NAME THAT DID NOT SOUND TO HIM AT ALL LIKE HARDING
AND IN THE VERY HEART OF THAT HAPPIEST MOMENT CAME LIKE A SHARP DAGGER PRICK THE THOUGHT OF BEALE
SO MUCH SO THAT HE WOULD NOT SHOW IT TO ELFRIDA UNTIL SHE HAD BEGGED VERY HARD INDEED
FOR SOME REASON OF HIS OWN BEALE LET THE OLD MAN TAKE THE BOX INTO HIS HAND
I EXPECT THE TREASURE'S BRICKED UP
CAN'T THINK WHY THEY EVER INVENTED HOUSES HE SAID AND THEN HE FELL ASLEEP
NOW I'LL COME OVER AND MAKE A START HE THREW HIS LEG OVER THE FENCE
WHEN EDRED SAW HOW HIS FATHER TRIED HIS BEST TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT DICKIE'S BIRTH AND HOW WILLING HE WAS TO GIVE UP WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS HIS OWN IF IT SHOULD PROVE TO BE NOT HIS DO YOU THINK HE WAS NOT GLAD TO KNOW THAT HE HAD DONE HIS DUTY AND RESCUED HIS COUSIN AND HAD NOT BY ANY MEANNESS OR ANY INDECISION BROUGHT DISHONOR ON THE NAME OF ARDEN
NEVER MIND WHAT IT IS
LET THEM GO
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF OUR PEOPLE
AND IF YOU WANT LONDON I'D LIKE OUR OLD HOUSE BECAUSE OF THE SEEDS I SOWED IN THE GARDEN
THE DOGS ALSO GREW IN NUMBERS AS WELL AS IN SIZE AND THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD BORNE A GOOD DEAL VERY PATIENTLY BEGAN AS MR BEALE SAID TO PASS REMARKS IT AIN'T SO MUCH THE LITTLE UNS THEY JIB AT SAID MR BEALE TAKING HIS PIPE OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND STRETCHING HIS LEGS IN THE BACK-YARD THOUGH TO MY MIND THEY YAPS FAR MORE AGGRAVATIN IT'S THE COCKER SPANNEL AND THE GREAT DANES UPSETS THEM THE COCKER SPANNEL HAS GOT RATHER A PERSEVERING BARK SAID DICKIE LOOKING UP AT THE CREEPING-JENNY IN THE WINDOW-BOXES
WHEN THE LAST WAS DONE HE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS--HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT THE HOUSE QUITE WELL THOUGH HE COULD NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING BEEN THERE BEFORE--AND CRIED OUT THY TASK DONE
HE NO LONGER WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM THESE PRESENT TIMES TO THOSE OLD DAYS WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING
YOU JUST PEG ABOUT AN BE BUSY PICKIN UP ALL THEM FANCY ARTICLES AND NEX TIME YOUR AUNT GOES TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE FOR THE DAY WE'LL HAVE A BONFIRE FIFTH O NOVEMBER SAID DICKIE SITTING DOWN AND BEGINNING TO DRAW TO HIMSELF THE RUBBISH THAT COVERED THE GROUND
THEY NEVER SEE MY FACE
AND PRESENTLY HE WOULD SEE EDRED AND ELFRIDA
COME ON
IT WAS PUT INTO A SORT OF CELLAR WITH DOORS AND WE'VE LOOKED ALL OVER WHAT'S LEFT OF THE CASTLE AND THERE ISN'T SO MUCH AS A TEENY SILVER RING TO BE FOUND I SEE SAID DICKIE
OH I AM HERE--OH I AM SO GLAD
AND YOU ALL HAVE LESSONS TOGETHER--THY TUTOR GIVES THEM
IT AIN'T AS I'M SILLY ABOUT IM--BUT E'S THAT CLEVER I OPE E'S CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO WOT E'S TOLD
ONLY BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME FROM THE REDHEADED MAN AND I DON'T KNOW AS I'M TAKING ANY FROM BEALE AND AT THE PARTING THE REDHEADED MAN SAYING I'LL DOSS SAME SHOP AS WOT YOU DO AND BEALE GIVING THE NAME OF THE LODGING-HOUSE WHERE ON THE WAY TO THE COFFEE-SHOP BEALE HAD LEFT THE PERAMBULATOR AND ENGAGED THEIR BEDS
WHAT DO YOU SAY MATEY THE MAN'S MANNER WAS SO KIND AND HEARTY THE WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND NEW
THAT WAS GOOD TO ME
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO FOR YOUR LIVING IF YOU COULD CHOOSE I WARN'T NEVER PUT TO NO TRADE SAID BEALE CEPT BEING ANDY WITH A ORSE
HE WAS TOO SLEEPY TO BE AFRAID
DON'T TURN THAT HORRIBLE COLOR WHISPERED A WHITE TOREADOR WHO WAS CLOSE TO HIM
TWENTY-FOUR SHILLINGS A WEEK FOR A CHAP AN IS NIPPER AIN'T SO DUSTY FARVER IS IT
I FEEL JUST EXACTLY LIKE AS IF I COULD
DICKIE GOT THE POINT OF THE CHISEL BETWEEN THE STONES AND PRIED AND PRESSED--HERE AND THERE AND AT THE OTHER END--TILL THE STONE MOVED FORWARD A LITTLE AT A TIME AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GET HOLD OF IT AND DRAG IT OUT
AND IT WAS TOO HE EXPECTED TO BE SHAKEN AND PUT DOWN
I'LL BE BACK AFORE SUNDOWN
HE WAS THINKING OVER A NEW DIFFICULTY
YOU JES WAIT HOLD ON A BIT THEM AS LIVES LONGEST SEES MOST"--THESE WERE THE SORT OF REMARKS WHICH WERE ALL THAT DICKIE COULD GET OUT OF HIM
BUT THERE ARE CHESTS OF DIFFERENT CLOTHES AND WHATEVER CLOTHES WE PUT ON WE COME TO THAT TIME IN HISTORY
HOW LORD ARDEN PRESENTED AN ENORMOUS WEDDING CAKE AND A GLORIOUS WEDDING BREAKFAST AND GAVE AWAY THE BRIDE AND MADE A SPEECH SAYING HE OWED A GREAT DEBT TO MR BEALE FOR HIS KINDNESS TO HIS NEPHEW RICHARD ARDEN AND HOW SURPRISED EVERY ONE WAS TO HEAR DICKIE'S NEW NAME
SUDDENLY HIS HANDS FELL BY HIS SIDE
IMMEDIATELY EVERYTHING BECAME DARK BUT BEFORE THE CHILDREN HAD TIME TO WISH THAT IT WAS LIGHT AGAIN A DISC OF LIGHT APPEARED ON THE CURTAIN OF DARKNESS AND THERE WAS THE MOULDIERWARP JUST AS DICKIE HAD SEEN HIM ONCE BEFORE
THEY REMAINED SOLID AND REAL
I SHAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING MORE HE SAID
TELL ME ALL--EVERY NAME EVERY PARTICULAR THE LOATHSOME TUTOR WAS SAYING OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR THEE AND THY FATHER ELFRIDA WAS POSITIVELY GREEN WITH TERROR AND LOOKED APPEALINGLY AT DICKIE
ONE WAS A LADY IN A CARRIAGE HE TOLD DICKIE LATER ON
THE BROWN SPANIEL AND TRUE SLEPT ON THE RAG HEARTH-RUG IN THE KITCHEN
WHAT AILS THEE TO ACT SO IT'S THE NOT BEING LAME DICKIE EXPLAINED COMING TO A STANDSTILL BY THE WINDOW THAT LOOKED OUT ON THE GOOD GREEN GARDEN
AND I'LL PAY A WEEK DOWN IF YOU LIKE MISTER--AND WE'LL GET OUR BITS OF STICKS IN TO-DAY WELL SAID THE LANDLORD TAKING A KEY FROM A NAIL ON THE WALL LET'S GO DOWN AND HAVE A LOOK AT THE OUSE
THE TWO CROSSED TRIANGLES OF WHITE SEEDS IN THE MIDST TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL LAY ON THE FLOOR OF THE LITTLE EMPTY HOUSE GREW DIM AND FAINT BEFORE DICKIE'S EYES AND HIS EYES SUDDENLY SMARTED AND FELT TIRED SO THAT HE WAS VERY GLAD TO SHUT THEM
THE TIME IS NOT RIPE FOR THEE TO TAKE UP ALL THINE HONORS THERE SHE SAID
AND HEARD THE STORY OF ENGLAND'S GREAT DANGER AND HER GREAT ESCAPES
ONLY WHEN BEALE APPEALED TO HIM HE WOULD SAY FARVER'S VERY GOOD TO ME
EVERY MAN TO HIS POST AND GOD SAVE US ALL CRIED THE CAPTAIN WHEN THE FOOD WAS SPREAD
IF HIS MEMORY SERVED IT WAS HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO--THREE FIVE--HE COULD NOT REMEMBER HOW MANY BUT HUNDREDS
JUST PEG WITH YER FOOT ON THE SPOT LOOKING UP CARELESS AT THE SKY THEY WENT OUT
DRINK IT UP AND SLEEP WELL DARLING SAID THE LADY
E TOLD ME ABOUT YER GARDEN I SHOULD A THOUGHT E'D A-FORGOT THE GARDEN SAME AS E'S FORGOT ME SAID THE OLD MAN
AND GET THIS OUT ILLUSTRATION
YOU'LL BE TOO FINE PRESENTLY TO SPEAK TO THE LIKES OF US YOU NIPPER SAID BEALE WHEN A SMART LITTLE PONY CART HAD BROUGHT DICKIE BACK TO THE COTTAGE
THE TALE OF DICKIE'S RESCUE FROM THE CAVE WAS THE TALK OF THE COUNTRYSIDE
AND HE WONDERED HOW HE COULD EVER HAVE DREAMED SUCH THINGS
ALSO A RATHER CROOKED BIT OF SOMETHING WHITISH AND VERY HARD GOOD TO SUCK OR TO STROKE WITH YOUR FINGERS OR TO DIG HOLES IN THE SOAP WITH
THEN HE SPAT THOUGHTFULLY
I HAVE KILLED A MAN HE SAID PAGE 290 I HAVE KILLED A MAN HE SAID
THE NIGHT WAS NO LONGER DARK TO EDRED
DOWN TRUE HE SAID
I'M SURE HE COMES OF GOOD PEOPLE--HE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED OR SOMETHING DON'T BE A DEAR SILLY ONE SAID SIR EDWARD
WHAT'S UP DICKIE ASKED AT LAST
THE NEWS OF HIS AUNT'S DEPARTURE HAD CHANGED EVERYTHING
HE WOULD TELL THEM
I KNOW HE'S WAITING THERE
OFTEN CHILDREN LOSE THIS POWER WHEN THEY ARE QUITE YOUNG
AND THE EARTHENWARE POT WAS SO BIG
THE MAN AS SAID E KNEW W'ERE MY FARVER WAS SAID DICKIE REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO SAY
WE GOT MY MAGIC ALL RIGHT AND OLD NURSE SAID I COULD WORK IT FOR YOU AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'VE COME FOR SO THAT WE CAN LOOK FOR THE TREASURE TOGETHER THAT'S AWFULLY JOLLY OF YOU SAID ELFRIDA
YET HE REMEMBERED HOW ONCE THAT LIFE IN KING JAMES'S TIME HAD SEEMED THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD AND HOW HE HAD CHOSEN TO COME BACK FROM IT TO HELP A HELPLESS MIDDLE-AGED NE'ER-DO-WEEL OF A TRAMP--BEALE
BEHIND WAS DARKNESS A HOLLOW--DICKIE PLUNGED HIS ARM IN
WHEN IT HAD HAD ITS SUPPER IT WAGGED ITS TAIL TURNED A CLEAR AND GENTLE EYE ON DICKIE AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING STOOD ON ITS HEAD
THEY HAD TOLD LIES YOU OBSERVE AND HAD BY THESE LIES MANAGED TO GET HALF A CROWN AND A PENNY OUT OF THE CHARITABLE
AN THE OLD CHAP
THERE WERE STONES AND BONES AND BITS OF BRICK AND DIRTY OLD DISH-CLOTHS MATTED TOGETHER WITH GREASE AND MUD WORN-OUT BROOM-HEADS AND BROKEN SHOVELS A BOTTOMLESS PAIL AND THE MOULDY REMAINS OF A HUTCH WHERE ONCE RABBITS HAD LIVED
MY LAMB SHE SAID
THIS IS CALLED THE GARDEN AND SOME OF THESE SHOW GREEN--BUT THEY ONLY SHOW IT TO THE HOUSES BACK WINDOWS
HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS HIS POOR LAME FOOT TIED TIGHT TO THE OTHER ONE
COME SIR HE SAID IN AS MANLY A VOICE AS HE COULD MANAGE YOU FRIGHTEN MY COUSIN
A ROOM
THE AUTHOR'S CHARMING NAME WAS GREEN AND RECALLED CURTAINS AND NIGHTS UNDER THE STARS
FINDING THAT THE MAN DID NOT RETURN THE DEPTFORD WOMAN BROUGHT UP THE CHILD AS HER OWN
AND THEN HE ASKED EDRED AND ELFRIDA TO COME UP TO THE CAVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD SOMETHING TO TELL THEM
CLICKETY-CLACK WENT THE CRUTCH ON THE DUSTY PAVEMENT
THAT RED'EADED CHAP WOT I NEVER SEE AND THEN THE REDHEADED MAN CAME ROUND THE PARTITION AND SAT DOWN BESIDE BEALE AND TALKED TO HIM AND DICKIE WISHED HE WOULDN'T
AN AS FOR EXERCISIN OF EM ALL EVERY DAY LIKE THE BOOKS SAY--WELL OW'S ONE PAIR OF ANDS TO DO IT LET ALONE LEGS AND YOU IN ANOTHER LINE OF BUSINESS AND NOT ABLE TO GIVE YER TIME TO EM I WISH WE HAD A BIGGER PLACE TOO SAID DICKIE
AND THE HOUSE WOULD BE SO MUCH STRONGER THAN ME--IT WOULD GET THE BEST OF IT AND WHERE SHOULD I BE THEN I'LL ASK WHERE THOU'D BE WAS THE VERY SURPRISING ANSWER
AND HE DID VERY QUICKLY LEARN A GREAT DEAL AND ALWAYS IT WAS MORE LIKE REMEMBERING THAN LEARNING
DICKIE YOU'LL COME HOME TO TEA WITH US WON'T YOU I MUST TELL MR BEALE SAID DICKIE
YOU KNOW HE HAD REALLY ONLY TOLD HER TWICE
BUT HE DID NOT GO
CHAPTER X THE NOBLE DEED WHEN LORD ARDEN AND ELFRIDA AND EDRED REACHED THE CASTLE AND FOUND THAT DICKIE HAD NOT COME BACK THE CHILDREN CONCLUDED THAT BEALE HAD PERSUADED HIM TO STAY THE NIGHT AT THE COTTAGE
I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE SILLY UNTRUTHS SHE ADDED RATHER SADLY AND I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS TRUE
I AVE NO FATHER NOR YET MOTHER TO BE UNEASY CAN YOU SPELL UNEASY
THAT'S WOT YOU DO DICKIE WENT
A THICK SWEET SMOKE ROSE FROM THE LITTLE FIRE IN THE SILVER PLATE AND THE NURSE WAS CHANTING SOMETHING IN A VERY LOW VOICE
FROM SOME MYSTERIOUS SOURCE MR BEALE HAD OBTAINED AN OLD DOUBLE PERAMBULATOR WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN MADE DICKIE THOUGHT FOR VERY FAT TWINS IT WAS SO BROAD AND ROOMY
FOR THE OLD KENT ROAD LEADS INTO THE NEW CROSS ROAD AND THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH THE YELLOW BRICK WILDERNESS WHERE DICKIE'S AUNT LIVED
AND OF COURSE THAT WAS A VERY NICE THING TO HAVE SAID TO ONE
AND DICKIE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE CROSS HE HAD SCRATCHED WITH THE BROKEN BIT OF PLATE
BUT I'VE GOT THIS HE HANDED THE LITTLE BOX ACROSS THE COUNTER
NOW IF YOU HAVE READ A BOOK CALLED THE HOUSE OF ARDEN YOU WILL ALREADY KNOW THAT DICKIE'S COUSINS WERE CALLED EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND THAT THEIR FATHER LORD ARDEN HAD A BEAUTIFUL CASTLE BY THE SEA AS WELL AS A HOUSE IN LONDON AND THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE GREAT FAVORITES AT THE COURT OF KING JAMES THE FIRST
DICKIE ANSWERED HONESTLY AND STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
WELL I'M GOING THERE AGAIN--FOR GOOD ILLUSTRATION
DICKIE WOKE GAY AS THE SPRING SUN THAT WAS TRYING TO LOOK IN AT HIM THROUGH HIS GRIMY WINDOWS
NONE EVER FORGETS WHAT I TELL THEM SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP
DUNNO OO YOU CAN TRUST THEN SAID AMELIA TOSSING A STILL HANDSOME HEAD
IP IP OORAY THE CHEERS WENT UP GIVEN WITH A GOOD HEART
AND THAT WAS THE GREATEST FUN OF ALL
AND THE NURSES HAD ASSURED HIM THAT THE SEEDS MUST BE UP LONG AGO--HE WOULD FIND EVERYTHING FLOWERING YOU SEE IF HE DIDN'T
ONLY WE'VE GOT A CHARM--BECAUSE IN OUR TIME EDRED IS LORD ARDEN AND THERE'S A WHITE MOLE WHO HELPS US AND WE CAN GO ANYWHERE IN HISTORY WE LIKE NOT QUITE SAID EDRED
WHERE'D YER NICK THAT ASKED A MAN WITH A RED HANDKERCHIEF
I THANK YOU ALL SAID THE FATHER OF EDRED AND ELFRIDA
THE CHILD LIVES IN THE PRESENT
THEN ASCEND THE STEPS OF THE THRONE SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP VERY KINDLY NOW AND SIT HERE BY MY SIDE EDRED OBEYED AND THE MOULDIESTWARP LEANED TOWARDS HIM AND SPOKE IN HIS EAR
AND WE MUST HAVE ANOTHER TRY FOR THE TREASURE SHE SAID
IN THE COURSE OF THIS ADVENTURE HE MET THE WHITE MOULDIWARP AND IT WAS JUST A WHITE MOLE VERY FUNNY AND RATHER SELF-IMPORTANT
AND YOU'VE LOWERED US TO THE CADGIN AGAIN
ALSO THERE WAS A TIN LAMP TO HANG ON THE WALL WITH A DAZZLING CRINKLED TIN REFLECTOR
WHAT IS HIS NAME DICKIE ASKED WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED THE GRAY'S EVERY POINT HAD HAD HIM SADDLED AND HAD RIDDEN HIM PROUDLY ROUND THE PASTURE IN HIS FATHER'S SIGHT
SEE THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP
THE WOODWORK WAS PAINTED IN WHITE AND GREEN AND RED AND AT BOW AND STERN WAS RICHLY CARVED AND GILDED
HE HAD EXPECTED WHEN HE WENT TO SLEEP THAT THE DREAM WOULD IN SLEEP END AND THAT HE WOULD WAKE TO FIND HIMSELF ALONE IN THE EMPTY HOUSE AT NEW CROSS
I DIDEN SLEEP MUCH THOUGH ANY MORE DREAMS BEALE ASKED KINDLY ENOUGH
THEN HE SAID PROCEED COUSIN ELFRIDA WENT ON TELLING HIM ABOUT THE GUNPOWDER PLOT BUT HE HARDLY LISTENED
AND THEN THEY BOTH LAUGHED
AND EDRED'S WHOLLY UNEXPECTED REPLY WAS YES PLEASE SO SHE WENT
I MUST DO A PROWL HE SAID
CAN I NOW THE NEW DOG WAS VERY LONG VERY BROWN VERY FRIENDLY AND CHARMING
ALL THE THINGS THAT HE HAD HATED IN THIS MODERN LIFE WHEN HE WAS DICKIE OF DEPTFORD CEASED TO TROUBLE HIM NOW THAT HE WAS RICHARD ARDEN
IT WAS DESPAIR
AND IT WAS WORTH WAITING AND WORKING FOR SEVEN LONG MONTHS TO FEEL THE THRILL THAT DICKIE FELT WHEN BEALE AS THEY TOPPED A RIDGE OF THE GREAT SOUTH DOWNS SAID SUDDENLY THERE'S THE SEA AND A DOZEN YARDS FURTHER ON THERE'S ARDEN CASTLE THERE IT LAY GRAY AND GREEN WITH ITS OLD STONES AND IVY--THE SAME CASTLE WHICH DICKIE HAD SEEN ON THE DAY WHEN THEY LAY AMONG THE FURZE BUSHES AND WAITED TO BURGLE TALBOT COURT
NO--DROPPED IT ALL WHEN I FIRED
BUT EVEN AMID THIS DELIGHT HE REMEMBERED TO ASK WHETHER SHE HAD PUT THE POLICE ON TO FATHER YET AND WAS RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT SHE HAD NOT
THE STOPPED-CLOCK FEELING WAS THICK ABOUT HIM AS HE REALIZED THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE VOICES HE HAD HEARD ON THAT NIGHT OF THE FIRST MAGIC--THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID HE IS MORE YOURS THAN MINE THE LIGHT THE NURSE CARRIED GLEAMED AND DISAPPEARED UP THE SECOND FLIGHT OF STAIRS
WELL WHAT AM I TO DO WHEN DICKIE'S FATHER DIED A DEPTFORD WOMAN RELATED TO DICKIE'S MOTHER KEPT THE CHILD
IT SAYS SO IN THE HISTORY OF ARDEN WE MUST DECIDE THAT LATER SAID HIS FATHER WHO HAD A LONG BLUE LAWYER'S LETTER IN HIS POCKET
AND NOW DICKIE FELT THAT HE MIGHT DARE TO GO BACK THROUGH THE THREE HUNDRED YEARS TO ALL THAT WAS WAITING FOR HIM THERE
WHEN THE BUSTLE OF ARRIVAL HAD CALMED A LITTLE DICKIE HIS HEART BEATING VERY FAST INDEED FOUND HIMSELF LED BY HIS TUTOR INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FINEST GENTLEMAN AND THE DEAREST LADY HE HAD EVER BEHELD
IT WAS JUST THE SAME STORY AS THE ONE YOU READ IN YOUR HISTORY BOOK--AND YET HOW DIFFERENT WHEN IT WAS TOLD BY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN THERE WHO HAD FELT THE DANGER KNOWN THE ESCAPE
TWO THINGS CAN'T BE IN THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME
THERE YOU GO SAID MR BEALE BUT DON'T YOU GO AND TALK TO EM LIKE THAT IF THEY PINCHES YOU
YET WHEN HE WOKE IN THE MORNING REMEMBERING MANY THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IS THIS THE DREAM
LEAVE GROWN-UP THINGS TO THE GROWN-UPS YOU SEE DICKIE TOLD HER SOMEHOW I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO WORRY ABOUT GROWN-UP THINGS
NO OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T
CHAPTER VII DICKIE LEARNS MANY THINGS THAT NIGHT DICKIE COULD NOT SLEEP
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THE JEWS ALWAYS SEE THE BIG BEAUTIFUL THINGS
I CAN FEEL THE DOOR HE SAID
NEVER MIND WE'LL TURN IT OVER AND WE'LL GET SOME LITTLE SEEDSES AND SOME LITTLE PLANTSES AND WE SHAN'T KNOW OURSELVES I GOT A APENNY SAID DICKIE
HE SAW THE WHITENESS OF THE DOG AND MADE FOR IT FELT FOR THE CHAIN UNHOOKED IT FROM THE STAPLE IN THE WALL AND WENT OUT AGAIN CLOSING THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND FOLLOWED VERY WILLINGLY BY TRUE
YES I WAS BOUND TO TURN UP
BUT THAT'S FOR TOFFS ON THREE QUID A WEEK REG'LAR WAGES
IT WAS NOT TOO LATE TO DO A MILE OR TWO OF THE GRAVESEND ROAD
ALL GENTLEPEOPLE HAVE IT DON'T YOU COME THE BLAZING TOFF OVER ME SAID BEALE WITH SUDDEN FIERCENESS CAUSE I WON'T AVE IT
SEE I SHALL PUT AN APRON ON THEE AND THOU SHALT BE MY PRENTICE AND LEARN TO BUILD ANOTHER QUAINT SHIP LIKE HER--TO BE HER CONSORT
THAT'S WHAT I OPED YOU'D SAY
I KNOW HIS WHOLE HISTORY
YOU WAS HIS LITTLE BOY ONCE WASN'T YOU AY SAID BEALE
AM I THE MASTER OR IS IT YOU
HE HAD HELPED THEN
IF SOME OF IS NOTIONS COME OUT RIGHT E'LL BE A-RIDIN IN IS OWN CART AND ORSE AFORE WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE--AND US A-TRAMPING IN IS DUST RIDIN IN BLACK MARIA MORE LIKE SAID DICKIE
THE WINDOW-SILL WAS OF STONE VERY COLD
SO LET HIM FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF A HERO SINCE THAT WAS WHAT INDEED HE WAS EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE ALL RIGHT-MINDED CHILDREN ARE MODEST AND HUMBLE AND FULLY SENSIBLE OF THEIR OWN INTENSE UNIMPORTANCE NO MATTER HOW HEROICALLY THEY MAY HAPPEN TO BE BEHAVING
EDRED AND ELFRIDA BEGAN TO ASK QUESTIONS
SINCE WHEN DEAR SINCE WEDNESDAY SAID DICKIE ANXIOUSLY
THE BIG MAN LAUGHED AND AS HE LAUGHED DICKIE LUNGED WITH HIS SWORD--THE WAY HIS TUTOR HAD TAUGHT HIM--AND THE LITTLE SWORD--NO TAILOR'S ORNAMENT TO A COURT DRESS BUT A PIECE OF TRUE STEEL--WENT STRAIGHT AND TRUE UP INTO THE HEART OF THAT BIG REBEL
YOU SEE I WAS BORN AND BRED ERE
I BET HIS MASTER WOT TAUGHT IM THAT'S SOLD HIM TIME AND AGAIN MAKIN A GOOD FIGURE EVERY TIME FOR E WAS A ANDSOME DAWG AS EVER I SEE
BOTH OUSES BOTH SIDES IS EMPTY
NOT BUT WHAT I LIKED IT WELL ENOUGH WHERE I WAS BRED
AND FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THE DATE OF THE GUNPOWDER PLOT
AND NOW HE HAD INDEED A FULL LIFE
THOUGH HE HAS WELL EARNED THE SAME
WE LAY UNDER A AYSTACK LAST NIGHT HE SAID ALOUD AND WHERE WE'LL LIE TO-NIGHT GRACIOUS ONLY KNOWS WITHOUT SOME KIND SOUL LENDS US A ELPING AND THE LADY FUMBLED IN HER POCKET AND THE LITTLE GIRL SAID TO DICKIE WHERE ARE ALL YOUR TOYS I AIN'T GOT BUT TWO SAID DICKIE AND THEY'RE AT OME
THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M A-SAYING AIN'T IT
BUT I DON'T COTTON TO IT MYSELF HE ADDED QUICKLY NOT THE BURGLING I DON'T
HOW LONG?--A MATTER OF TWENTY YEARS OR THEREABOUTS SAID THE SHIP-BUILDER
HE HAD HAD TO WRITE THE DATE TWO HUNDRED TIMES SO HE WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN OF IT
I AM SO GLAD I AM NOT LAME FANCY-FULL AS EVER SAID HIS FATHER
BESIDES THERE'S THE BLUE RIBBON THAT THE DOG THE WOMAN ASKED
HE TURNED TO GO THE WAY HIS COUSINS HAD GONE
IT WAS SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND THE NEXT-DOOR GARDEN WAS ONE OF THE GREEN ONES
WHY HAD NO ONE ELSE THOUGHT OF PUTTING THE DOG ON THE SCENT
OH STOW IT DICKIE SAID
YOU'RE STRAIGHT YOU ARE--ONE OF THE BEST
SO HE SAID I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU BOTH THERE'S PURTY MANNERS THE MOULDIWARP SAID
BUT BIG
THE NEWSPAPERS AND DIRTY SACKINGS STILL LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AS THEY HAD FALLEN FROM DICKIE WHEN HE HAD GOT UP IN THE MORNING AFTER THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD HAD THE DREAM
AND THE NURSE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLEASANT FIELDS AND ORCHARDS
MY MISTIKE
I'LL COME SAID HE AND THANK YOU KINDLY MIND YOU SAID THE MAN CAREFULLY THIS AIN'T NO KIDNAPPING
HE WANTED TO TALK OVER THE WHOLE WONDERFUL ADVENTURE WITH THEM
ONLY DON'T GO TRYING TO SEAL WITH IT OR THE SEALING-WAX WILL MELT THE CEMENT
WHEN THE LAST BUNDLE HAD BEEN CARRIED THE LAST CHEST SET DOWN WITH A DUMP ON THE STONE FLOOR OF SOME ROOM BEYOND THE CHILDREN HEARD A DOOR SHUT AND A KEY TURNED AND THEN THE MEN CAME BACK ALL TOGETHER ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THE CHILDREN FOLLOWED THEM
YOU GET UP AND PEG ALONG IN AN ARST YOUR AUNT IF SHE'D BE AGREEABLE FOR ME TO DO UP HER GARDEN A BIT
WALKING TOWERS THEY CALL EM I'D LIKE IT SAID DICKIE BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DOGS OH
CAUSE I WANTER GIVE THAT THERE LITTLE BOX TO A CHAP I KNOW WOT LENT ME THE MONEY FOR THE TRAIN TO COME TO YOU AT GRAVESEND PAY IM SOME OTHER DAY WHEN WE'RE FLUSHER I'D RATHER PAY IM NOW SAID DICKIE
WE SHOULDN'T NEVER AVE THOUGHT O THAT
I AIN'T NO GOOD WIV ME ANDS--NOT AT WORKING YOU KNOW--NOT TO SAY WORKING DICKIE SUPPRESSED A WILD NOTION HE HAD HAD OF GETTING INTO THAT DREAM AGAIN LEARNING SOME USEFUL TRADE THERE WAKING UP AND TEACHING IT TO MR BEALE
AND DICKIE LIVED AT ARDEN AND LOVED IT AND ENJOYED HIMSELF
WARN'T YOUR BED TO YOUR LIKING THE BED WAS ALL RIGHT SAID DICKIE THINKING OF THE BED IN THE DREAM
HE HEARD LITTLE OF THE CONVERSATION
HE DID NOT WANT TO LET OUT THE FACT THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING WHATEVER OF THE DOINGS OF THE LAST MONTH
COME TO YOURSELF EH SNEERED THE AUNT
I MIGHT A-PICKED AN CHOOSED HE ADDED REFLECTIVELY BUT THERE--I DARE SAY I MIGHT A-DONE WORSE MELIA BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE AT THE COMPLIMENT AND WENT ON WITH THE DUSTING
ONCE HE PICKED THESE UP AND LOOKED AT THE CREST ON THEM
HE DARED NOT FOLLOW THE ROAD THROUGH THOSE WELL-KNOWN SCENES
TIS THE PICTURE SAID HE PROUDLY OF MY OLD SHIP THE GOLDEN VENTURE PAGE 97 TIS THE PICTURE SAID HE PROUDLY OF MY OLD SHIP THE GOLDEN VENTURE THAT I SAILED IN WITH MASTER RALEIGH AND HELP TO SINK THE ACCURSED ARMADA AND CLIP THE KING OF SPAIN HIS WINGS AND SINGE HIS BEARD THE ARMADA SAID DICKIE WITH A NEW AND QUITE STRANGE FEELING RATHER LIKE GOING DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY IN A LIFT
I DIDN'T TELL YOU DID I WE PASSED CLOSE LONGSIDE OUR OLD OME THAT TIME WE SLEP AMONG THE FURZE BUSHES
THEN HOW'S US TO GET A HONEST LIVING
THERE WERE CAPTAINS WHO WENT DOWN WITH THEIR SHIPS GENERALS WHO DIED FIGHTING FOR FORLORN HOPES PATRIOTS KINGS NUNS MONKS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN--ALL WITH THAT LIGHT IN THEIR EYES WHICH BRIGHTENS WITH SPLENDOR THE DREAMS OF MEN
YOU GO AND SEE IM NOW
LADY'S AND GENT'S EASY-CHAIRS FOUR HOCCASIONALS PIANNER AND FOOMED OAK BOOREAU CURTAINS SAID DICKIE--"WHITE CURTAINS FOR THE PARLOR AND SHORT BLINDS EVERYWHERE ELSE
IT'S THAT BEASTLY MAGIC SAID EDRED AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN WERE ALONE
I WISH EDRED AND ELFRIDA MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT I HAVE DONE
NOW WRITE WHAT I SAY
HIS COUSIN WAS WAITING
IF YOU'RE CLEAN THEY SAY HONEST POVERTY AN IF YOU'RE DIRTY THEY SAY SERVE YOU RIGHT WE'LL GET A PAIL OR SOMETHING THIS VERY NIGHT YOU ARE GOOD SAID DICKIE
WHY FATHER E AIN'T DONE NOTHING NO NO OF COURSE NOT SAID THE LADY IN A HURRY
AN I FOUND IM WANDERING
THE NURSE HAD TAKEN BURNING WOOD FROM THE HEARTH AND SET IT ON A SILVER PLATE
OR RATHER A LODGING
AN SHE GOT IT TOO
IT'S NOT THAT I'M AFTER SAID DICKIE WITH DIGNITY
WOULDN'T WHAT WHATEVER HE WANTS TO WHY I AIN'T TOLD YOU YET WHAT HE DOES WANT E AIN'T UP TO NO GOOD--I KNOW THAT E'S FULL OF NOTIONS THAT'S WOT E IS SAID BEALE
IT IS SO VERY HARD NOT TO BLACKEN THE BLACKNESS OR WHITEN THE WHITENESS WHEN ONE COMES TO TRYING TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT ONESELF
UNLESS THEY ASK ME HE ADDED
THE SPLENDOR OF DISTANCE--YOU NEVER SEE DISTANCE IN DEPTFORD
AND AGAIN BEALE WAS INSPIRED TO TRUTHFULNESS--QUITE A LOT OF IT
AND HOW WHEN THE WEDDING FEAST WAS OVER AND THE GUESTS GONE THE BRIDE TUCKED UP HER WHITE DRESS UNDER A BIG APRON AND SET ABOUT ARRANGING IN THE NEW ROOMS THE STICKS OF FURNITURE WHICH DICKIE AND BEALE HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER FROM THE LITTLE HOME IN DEPTFORD AND WHICH HAD COME IN A VAN BY ROAD ALL THE WAY TO ARDEN
THERE'S ROOM IN THE COTTAGE FOR ALL FIVE OF US
IT WON'T HANG THROUGH ANOTHER WASHING
THE LAWYER WHO HAD COME ON A BICYCLE WENT OFF ON IT AT RACING SPEED TO TELL THE BANK AT CLIFFVILLE TO COME AND FETCH THE TREASURE AND TO BRING POLICE TO WATCH OVER IT TILL IT SHOULD BE SAFE IN THE BANK VAULTS
WHEN HE SAID AVE I BIN ASLEEP THE STEAMER WAS STOPPING AT A PIER AT A STRANGE PLACE WITH TREES
DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD GETTING ME INTO TROUBLE BUT DICKIE SAID A GOOD MANY OTHER WORDS AND FELL ASLEEP QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE LAST WORDS THAT HAD FALLEN FROM MARKHAM
THE ELFRIDA AND EDRED WHO LIVE IN THOSE TIMES ARE AS LIKE YOU AS TWO PINS
BUT WE'VE GOT FATHER WELL BUT LOOK HERE SAID DICKIE
IT CAN BE DONE HE SAID BUT IT WILL BE HARD
IT WAS JUNE NOW AND THE SCENT OF THE ROSES WAS VERY SWEET AND THE NIGHTINGALES KEPT HIM AWAKE AWHILE
BUT WE MUST DO SOMETHING AND PERHAPS I KNOW IT'S JUST ONLY PERHAPS IT MIGHT HELP IF WE DRESSED UP
NURSE DICKIE CALLED
WAIT IF YOU SAY SO SAID DICKIE RATHER DISCONTENTEDLY
GOOD-BYE HAD TO BE SAID BECAUSE OF FATHER HAVING FALLEN OFF THE SCAFFOLDING WHERE HE WAS AT WORK AND NOT GETTING BETTER
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE SAID HER HUSBAND
MY DAD GIVE IT TO ME AND IT BELONGED TO HIS DAD
IT'TH A PRACTICAL JOKE I SHUPPOTHE SAID THE DARK MAN
THIS IS THE WHITE WORLD
OBVIOUS PUNCTUATION ERRORS REPAIRED
AND YOU'LL NEVER FORGET ME THOUGH THERE ARE ONE OR TWO THINGS I WANT YOU TO FORGET
I DO LOVE YOU THE LADY WENT AWAY VERY PLEASED
I WOULD SO LIKE TO HAVE ONE
AND TIS TIME FOR THY POSSET SHE TOOK A PIPKIN FROM THE HEARTH WHERE A SMALL FIRE BURNED THOUGH IT WAS SUMMER WEATHER AS DICKIE COULD SEE BY THE GREEN TREE-TOPS THAT SWAYED AND MOVED OUTSIDE IN THE SUN POURED SOME GRUEL OUT OF IT INTO A SILVER BASIN
NO I WAS JUST A-THINKIN WE'D BEST BUY THE STICKS FIRST THING SAID BEALE
AND NOW WE SHALL NEVER FIND THE TREASURE OR BE ABLE TO BUY BACK THE OLD LANDS AND RESTORE THE CASTLE AND BRING THE WATER BACK TO THE MOAT AND BUILD NICE DRY WARM COZY COTTAGES FOR THE TENANTS
OR A DAWG HE ADDED
TAKE YOUR BIBLE YUSS SAID DICKIE
THE DOOR OF ONE OF THE DOG-ROOMS WAS OPEN AND A FRINGE OF INQUISITIVE DOGS ORNAMENTED THE PASSAGE
I'VE MADE A LIDDLE TUNNEL FOR E--SO I AVE--'ERE IN DIS ERE CORNER--YOU COME CATEN WISE CROSE THE FLOOR AND YOU'LL FEEL IT
BUT I'LL HELP YOU TO GET EVEN WITH OLD PARROT-NOSE AND SUGGESTED SHOVELLING THE SNOW OFF THE ROOF INTO THE ROOM OF THAT DISMAL TYRANT THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT CONVENIENTLY LIGHTING IT
BUT EVEN I'M NOT LORD ARDEN NOW
DICKIE HOWEVER HAD LEARNED HIS SECOND LANGUAGE FROM BOOKS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO DO
BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE THE DUEL HE WROTE A LETTER SAYING WHAT HE HAD DONE AND PUT IT IN A SECRET CUPBOARD BEHIND A PICTURE OF A LADY WHO WAS BORN AN ARDEN AT TALBOT COURT
VENTURES
SOME ONE WOULD HAVE TIME TO SEE IT AND SNATCH IT AND HOLD TO IT ISN'T THERE ANY WAY DICKIE ASKED INSISTING TO HIMSELF THAT HE WASN'T SLEEPY
THE SMELL ALL ABOUT HIM WAS NOT OF ROSES BUT OF DUST-BINS AND THERE WERE NO NIGHTINGALES--BUT FAR AWAY HE COULD HEAR THAT RESTLESS ROAR THAT IS THE VOICE OF LONDON AND NEAR AT HAND THE FOOLISH SONG AND UNSTEADY FOOTFALL OF A MAN GOING HOME FROM THE CAT AND WHISTLE HE SCRATCHED A CROSS ON THE HARD GROUND WITH A BROKEN BIT OF A PLATE TO MARK THE SPOT GOT UP AND CREPT ON HANDS AND KNEES TO THE HOUSE CLIMBED IN AND FOUND THE ROOM WHERE BEALE LAY ASLEEP
AND THE DAYS WENT ON AND LESSONS WITH MR PARADOS WERE A SORT OF INQUISITION TORTURE TO DICKIE
BUT HE HEARD HER SAY MR TRESHAM WROTE TO HIS RELATION LORD MONTEAGLE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BLOW UP THE KING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF SAYING WHAT KING THOUGH HE KNEW THE ANSWER PERFECTLY WELL
IT'S BETTER'N FIFF OF NOVEMBER SAID DICKIE
YET IT WAS THE MEMORY OF THE HOSPITAL THAT MADE HIM SAY I WISH I COULD AVE A BATH SO YOU SHALL SAID MR BEALE
THE KING LIES HERE TO-NIGHT AT SIR THOMAS BRADBURY'S
ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE DREAM HE HAD CHOSEN TO AWAKEN FROM FOR THE SAKE OF BEALE A BOWL OF PORRIDGE WOULD BE SMOKING AT THE END OF A LONG OAK TABLE AND A GREAT CARVED CHAIR BE SET FOR A LITTLE BOY WHO WAS NOT THERE
MAY I HAVE A DRINK OF WATER DICKIE ASKED
IT SEEMED TO HIM A WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL AND SPORTING AMUSEMENT
HOW LONG WOULD YOUR FATHER WISH TO KEEP HIS HOUSE AND HIS CASTLE IF HE KNEW THAT THEY BELONGED TO SOME ONE ELSE I SEE SAID EDRED STILL DOUBTFULLY
MY FOOT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT HE SAID IN NOWADAYS TIME
I'LL AND IT ROUND IN ME AND
AND FROM THE SKY ABOVE A SWAN CARRIAGE SUDDENLY SWOOPED
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT THE BEDROOM WINDOW SHOWED A SQUARE OF LIGHT AND LORD ARDEN BELOW HEARD BEALE BLUNDERING ABOUT ABOVE
THE FACT IS THE LITTLE CHAP'S AUNT WASN'T MUCH CLASS
IS IT A HOSPITAL
EXPLORING THE OLD SMUGGLERS CAVES WAS EXCITING AND DELIGHTFUL AS EXPLORING CAVES ALWAYS IS
HE WAS MUCH LARGER THAN EITHER OF THE OTHER MOLES AND HIS FUR WAS AS SILVERY AS THE FEATHERS OF A SWAN
DICKIE STRETCHED IN THE DOWNY BED FELT EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN
GOOD-BYE MY MAN AND NEXT MONTH BUT NEXT MONTH FOUND DICKIE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE FROM THE PAWNBROKER'S SHOP AND WITH A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE PAWNBROKER WHO IN HIS RURAL RETIREMENT AT BROCKLEY GARDENED IN SUCH A GENTLEMANLY WAY
I AM SO GLAD SHE SAID
BEALE TOOK IT
AND THE FRONT WINDOW WENT UP EASILY
BUT IT WAS NOT SO DIFFICULT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE
I WOULDN'T LIKE ANYTHING TO APPEN TO IM SO I WOULDN'T DICKIE TOOK HIS BOOTS OFF AND WENT TO SLEEP AS USUAL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MR BEALE WOKE HIM UP AND SAID IT'S TIME THERE WAS NO MOON THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS VERY VERY DARK
I'LL AVE TO GO TO THE DOSS TO GET OUR PRAM AND THINGS ANY'OW THE LANDLORD OF THE DESIRED HOUSE REALLY THOUGHT MR BEALE A QUITE RESPECTABLE WORKING MAN AND MR BEALE ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR LACK OF FURNITURE BY SAYING QUITE TRUTHFULLY THAT HE AND HIS NIPPER HAD COME UP FROM GRAVESEND DOING A BIT OF WORK ON THE WAY
AND LYING ON THE SAND NEAR THE STREAM WAS SOMETHING DARK
DICKIE ONLY MADE A BOX AND A PART OF A BOX THAT DAY
HE WAS GOING TO HELP MR BEALE TO LIVE IT
NEXT TIME HE AWOKE IT WAS WITH MANY QUESTIONS
ELFRIDA BURST INTO THE LIBRARY WHERE HER FATHER WAS BUSY WITH MANY LAWYERS LETTERS AND PAPERS AND ALSO WITH THE LAWYER HIMSELF A STOUT JOLLY-LOOKING GENTLEMAN IN A TWEED SUIT NOT A BIT LIKE THE LONG LEAN DISAGREEABLE BLACK-COATED LAWYERS YOU READ ABOUT IN BOOKS
THE LITTLE CRUTCH WHICH WAS LYING CORNER-WISE ABOVE HIM IN THE HAMPER JERKED OUT AND RATTLED ON THE FLOOR
I WASN'T NEVER PRENTICED TO NO TRADE NO MORE'N WHAT YOU'LL BE WORSE LUCK SAID DICKIE
THAT WAS WHY THEY DID NOT SEE A DARK FIGURE THAT CAME QUIETLY CREEPING ACROSS THE SAND TOWARDS THEM
HE HESITATED THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
HE NO LONGER CARED FOR IT
AND I DO LIKE YOU
THE TOP BOLT'S CUT THROUGH AND ALL THE OTHERS IS OILED
WALK AS OPPY AS YOU CAN AND IF THEY ARSTS YOU YOU SAY YOU AIN'T AD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE LAS NIGHT AND THEN IT WAS A BIT O DRY BREAD RIGHT YOU ARE SAID DICKIE ENJOYING THE GAME
YES OH YES SAID DICKIE AND I CARVED BOXES IN MY DREAM AND SOLD THEM AND I WANT TO LEARN A LOT MORE THINGS SO THAT WHEN I GO BACK AGAIN--I MEAN WHEN I DREAM THAT DREAM AGAIN--I SHALL BE ABLE TO EARN MORE MONEY TIS SHAME THAT ONE OF THY NAME SHOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR MONEY SAID THE NURSE
IT WAS CLOSE TO THE WITHERED STALK OF THE MOONFLOWER
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE HAD WHAT IS CALLED THE KEY OF THE STREET FOR YEARS ENOUGH YOU HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR THE KEY OF A ROOM
THERE YOU'RE DRY NOW
THIS ERE GARDEN'S IN A POOR STATE SAID BEALE IN A LOUD VOICE
AND THERE WE ARE
IT'S A CARSTLE--LIKE WOT THE KING'S GOT AT WINDSOR IS IT A KING AS LIVES ERE THEN DICKIE ASKED
NEVER MIND
HE PULLED IT OUT AND LIGHTED IT AND BLINKED PERCEIVING ALMOST AT ONCE THAT HE WAS IN THE BEGINNING OF AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE
HE WANTS FAR MORE THAN WE CAN THINK OF MANAGING AND DICKIE HEARD WHAT HE SAID
THE FIFTH DAY OF NOVEMBER 1608 SO HE DID NOT SEE HIS AUNT AND COUSIN IN THEIR WHITEHALL FINERY--AND IT WAS QUITE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE HE EVEN SAW HIS OTHER COUSIN WHO HAD BEEN SAMPLER-SEWING
WELL IF THEY WAS TO NAB YOU YOU JUST SAY WHAT I TELLS YOU TO
THE OTHER CHILDREN HAD A DONKEY-CART AND THE THREE MADE ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING EXPEDITIONS
HE'S FAR ABOVE GRAMMAR I'M SURE I WISH EVERY ONE WAS SIGHED EDRED AND I DARE SAY YOU HAVE OFTEN FELT THE SAME
AND THE MAID-SERVANT OPENED THE PARLOR DOOR AND SAID LADY TALBOT THOUGH HE REMEMBERED WELL ENOUGH HOW KIND SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM DICKIE WISHED HE COULD CREEP UNDER THE TABLE
IT'LL BRING YOU LUCK I SHOULDN'T WONDER IT DID
SWELP ME BOB WE'LL BE RIDIN IN OUR OWN MOTY AFORE WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE AT THIS RATE BUT YOU SAID THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS URGED DICKIE
THE PRESENT WAS AFTER ALL THE REAL THING
WELL I AIN'T ASKIN YOU TO DO ANYTHING AM I SAID BEALE
HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THAT ONE GOOD THRUST FOR THE GOOD CAUSE
THE THIRD WALL WAS ALMOST ALL WINDOW AND IN THE FOURTH WALL THE FIREPLACE WAS SET WITH A HIGH-HOODED CHIMNEY AND WIDE OPEN HEARTH
DON'T BE SO FLASH WITH YER OWN OUSES THEY HAD SUPPER AT A COFFEE-SHOP IN THE BROADWAY
HE KNEW BETTER THAN TO ASK WHAT HAD BECOME OF IT
AND THEN KNEW QUITE SUDDENLY THAT HE WAS TOO TIRED TO TRAVEL ANY FURTHER THAT NIGHT
OLD NURSE TOLD ME SO AND SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING
MIGHT A PASSED IM IN A CROWD--SEE YUSS SAID DICKIE AGAIN
WHEN MARKHAM CAME WITH THE MILK DICKIE SAID YOU WANT ME GONE DON'T YOU MARKHAM SAID SHE DIDN'T CARE
MY FARVER'S THERE AWAITIN FOR ME GARN SAID THE MAN
GREAT ARDEN'S LORD NO TREASURE SHALL REGAIN TILL ARDEN'S LORD IS LOST AND FOUND AGAIN AND FATHER WAS LOST AND FOUND AGAIN SAID EDRED SO THAT'S ALL RIGHT SET FORTH TO SEEK IT WITH COURAGEOUS FACE
I SEE AND E'S A JOLLY LITTLE CHAP SAID BEALE WARMING TO HIS SUBJECT AND FORGETTING HIS CAUTION AS KNOWING AS A DOG-FERRET
I HADN'T TIME TO PUT ON MY STOCKINGS SHE EXPLAINED LATER
SHE LOOKED MALEVOLENTLY AT DICKIE
AND SEBASTIAN GENTLY MOCKING HIM ANSWERED A GREAT WHILE INDEED--TWO WHOLE LONG DAYS
YOU NEVER SEE ME BLUB AFORE AND YOU WON'T AGAIN HE SAID
I AIN'T SAID HE
COME ALONG DEN
IT WAS A WONDERFUL BREAKFAST
THIS IS LORD ARDEN HE SAID THROWING HIS ARM ROUND THE SHOULDERS OF DICKIE LITTLE LAME DICKIE WHO STOOD THERE LEANING ON HIS CRUTCH PALE AS DEATH
HE HAD NOT LIVED IN THE TIME OF THE FIRST JAMES BE SURE WITHOUT HEARING MAGIC TALKED OF
YES SAID THE LADY GENTLY IT'S ALL RIGHT--POOR LITTLE CHAP DON'T BE FRIGHTENED--NOBODY WANTS TO HURT YOU I'M NOT FRIGHTENED SAID DICKIE--"NOT NOW TO LET REMINDED THE LADY PERSUASIVELY
WE BELONG THREE HUNDRED YEARS LATER IN HISTORY
ARTFULLY PILED ON THE FRONT PART WAS ALL THE FURNITURE NEEDED BY TRAVELLERS WHO MEAN TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT AT THE INN OF THE SILVER MOON
I COULDN'T GET ON IF IT WASN'T FOR FARVER OH WELL DONE LITTLE UN SAID MR BEALE TO HIMSELF
LISTEN SHE SAID WHEN IT CAME TO THE SILVER SUGAR-LOAF BUTTONS OF THE DOUBLET
COME CHILDREN SAID THE AUNT--OH WHAT A DIFFERENT AUNT TO THE ONE WHO HAD SLAPPED DICKIE IN DEPTFORD SOLD THE RABBIT-HUTCH AND SHOT THE MOON!--"YOU BOYS REMEMBER HOW I SHOWED YOU TO CARRY MY TRAIN
SAY MATEY JUST YOU CHUCK IT
I KNOW I SHALL HE ADDED DOUBTFULLY AND PAUSED
BESIDES HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO DIG IT UP EVEN IF HE COULD DO SO UNOBSERVED
AS FOR ELFRIDA WHEN SHE KNEW THE WHOLE STORY OF THAT NIGHT OF RESCUE SHE ADMIRED HER BROTHER SO MUCH THAT IT MADE HIM ALMOST UNCOMFORTABLE
HOW SHE WORE A WHITE DRESS AND A LARGE HAT WITH A WREATH OF ORANGE BLOSSOMS A FILMY VEIL AND REAL KID GLOVES--ALL GIFTS OF MISS EDITH ARDEN LORD ARDEN'S SISTER
MY LORD E SAYS THERE'S SOME WOMAN BEEN WRITING LETTERS TO IM THIS LONG TIME SAYING SHE'D GOT OLD OF IS LONG-LOST NEPHEW OR COUSIN OR SOMETHING AND A-WANTING TO GET MONEY OUT OF HIM--THOUGH WHAT FOR GOODNESS KNOWS
WHATEVER WILL YOU DO WITHOUT US THAT SAID DICKIE WON'T BE SO BAD AS YOU THINK
NOW HE LOOKED
THE LADY LEFT HIM ALONE WITH A BOOK BEAUTIFUL BEYOND HIS DREAMS--THREE GREAT VOLUMES WITH PICTURES OF THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED AND BEEN SINCE THE DAYS OF HEREWARD HIMSELF
HE ONLY SAW THE HOUSE HE LOVED BROKEN INTO BY MEN HE HATED
ONLY THE GRASS IN FRONT OF THEM WAS TRAMPLED AND BROKEN
ALL HIS LITTLE BRAIN AWAKE TO ONE ONLY THOUGHT
OR HE MAY BE A REALLY BENEVOLENT PERSON
HE FOUGHT IN A DUEL AND WAS KILLED
AND THE TREES AND GRASS AND LIGHTS AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS THE KINDLY GREAT PEOPLE WITH THEIR SPLENDID DRESSES THE KING AND QUEEN THE AUNTS AND UNCLES AND THE LITTLE COUSINS--ALL THESE THINGS REFUSED TO FADE AWAY AND JUMBLE THEMSELVES UP AS THINGS DO IN DREAMS
YOU MUST ONLY CALL ON HIM WHEN YOU WISH TO END OUR MAGICS AND TO WORK A MAGIC GREATER THAN OURS WHAT COULD BE GREATER DICKIE ASKED AND BOTH THE CREATURES LOOKED VERY PLEASED
I COULD WRITE A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT IT
THOU'RT HERE SAID SHE
I'VE GOT TO DO IT THERE WAS THAT IN HIS VOICE WHICH SILENCED AND CONVINCED THEM
THEY DO SAY THAT THE FEVER HURTS THE MEMORY BUT THIS BEATS ALL
AND IF YOU GO TO SEEK TREASURE OF ONE KIND YOU MAY FIND TREASURE OF ANOTHER
I'VE GOT THE KNIFE THEY GIVE ME TO CUT THE STRING OF THE BASKET IN THE TRAIN
DICKIE STRODE ON MANFULLY BUT THE PAIN IN HIS BACK MADE HIM FEEL SICK
THE MAN WHO HAD STOLEN THE CHILD SAID HE WOULD RETURN IN A MONTH
AND IF HE MET HIS AUNT
YOU AIN'T AFRAID THOSE TALBOTS WILL KNOW YOU AGAIN NOT MUCH I AIN'T
YOU MAY THINK THAT DICKIE WOULD BE VERY EXCITED BY THE THOUGHT OF MEETING IN THIS WORKADAY NOWADAYS WORLD THE CHILDREN WITH WHOM HE HAD HAD SUCH WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN THE OTHER WORLD THE DREAM WORLD--TOO EXCITED PERHAPS TO FEEL REALLY INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE EVERY-DAY HAPPENINGS OF THE ROAD BUT THIS WAS NOT SO
THERE THERE MY LAMB SHE SAID PETTING HIM
EDRED IS QUITE AS BRAVE AS ME SHE SAID
THE FRONT ROOM WAS A PARLOR--A REAL PARLOR
THE END 300 ILLUSTRATIONS EDRED OBEYED AND THE MOULDIESTWARP LEANED TOWARDS HIM AND SPOKE IN HIS EAR FRONTISPIECE FACING PAGE GIMME SAID DICKIE--'GIMME A PENN'ORTH O THAT THERE 6 IT IS A MOONFLOWER OF COURSE HE SAID 12 HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE IN A JUG OF WATER TILL I GO HOME 16 HE LAY FACE DOWNWARD ON THE ROAD AND TURNED UP HIS BOOT 24 IT ONLY PAWNS FOR A SHILLIN SAID DICKIE 38 THREE OR FOUR FACES LOOKED DOWN AT DICKIE 70 HE MADE WITH TRIPLE LINES OF SILVERY SEEDS A SIX-POINTED STAR 80 TIS THE PICTURE HE SAID PROUDLY OF MY OLD SHIP THE GOLDEN VENTURE 98 THE GALLEY WAS DECKED WITH FRESH FLOWERS 102 AN I OFF'S WITH ME COAT AND FLOPS IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PUDDLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GAL 134 OH WHAT A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEE DICKIE CRIED 148 IT HURT BUT DICKIE LIKED IT 158 ELFRIDA SAID BOTH BOYS AT ONCE 272 I HAVE KILLED A MAN HE SAID 290 I'VE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH SAID
YOU DUNNO WHAT A DREAM IT WAS
WELL P'RHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT
IT WAS CLOSED
I DON'T LIKE IT HE SAID
A GOLDFINCH SWUNG ON A SWAYING HAZEL BRANCH AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH BRIGHT EYES UNAFRAID
HE LIKED THE GOOD STRAIGHTFORWARD OLD-FASHIONED KIND OF MAGIC THAT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO--THE KIND THAT JUST TOOK YOU OUT OF ONE LIFE INTO ANOTHER LIFE AND MADE BOTH LIVES AS REAL ONE AS THE OTHER
WELL WAS RICHARD LORD ARDEN TO BE AFRAID OF EXILE--OR OF ANYTHING ELSE
WELL FIRE AWAY
THIS IS LORD ARDEN COME TO HIS OWN
CHILDREN GO TO YOUR MOTHER
BUT HE DID NOT DREAM
THERE WAS A WOMAN'S VOICE
NEXT DAY MR BEALE PRODUCED THE LONELY LEG OF A SOFA--MAHOGANY A FAT ROUND TURNED LEG OLD AND SEASONED
BUT EDRED WANTED THAT WRITTEN DOWN--ABOUT KENT AND DERBYSHIRE--SO THAT THEY MIGHT SEE WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO THEIR OWN TIMES WHETHER IT WAS TRUE
AND HE RECOGNIZED IT AT ONCE AS A REALLY USEFUL IDEA
THIS SURPRISED DICKIE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM AND IT FRIGHTENED HIM A LITTLE TOO
ONLY I CALLS HER THAT SHE ANY GOOD AIN'T BAD WHEN SHE'S IN A GOOD TEMPER THAT AIN'T WHAT SHE'LL BE IN WHEN YOU GETS BACK
THAT'S RIGHT--YOU ARE A SCHOLAR AN I ASKS YOU LET ME COME ALONGER YOU GOT THAT
I'M GLAD YOU WOULDN'T LET ME ADOPT YOU RICHARD SHE SAID WHEN ELFRIDA AND EDRED HAD BEEN SENT TO HER GARDEN TO GET A BASKET OF PEACHES TO TAKE HOME WITH THEM BECAUSE JUST WHEN I HAD BECOME ENTIRELY ATTACHED TO YOU YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT YOUR REAL RELATIONS AND WHERE WOULD YOUR POOR FOSTER-MOTHER HAVE BEEN THEN IF I COULD HAVE STAYED WITH YOU I WOULD SAID DICKIE SERIOUSLY
IF ONLY WE'D GOT THE OLD WHITE MAGIC AND THE MOULDIWARP TO HELP US WE COULD FIND OUT WHAT'S BECOME OF HIM PERHAPS HE HAS FALLEN DOWN A DISUSED MINE EDRED SUGGESTED AND IS LYING PANTING FOR WATER AND HIS FAITHFUL DOG HAS JUMPED DOWN AFTER HIM AND BROKEN ALL ITS DEAR LEGS ELFRIDA MELTED TO TEARS AT THIS DESPERATE PICTURE MELTED TO A SPEECHLESS EXTENT
TWO DAYS WORK HE SAID
HE--LITTLE LAME DICKIE HARDING OF DEPTFORD--HE WOULD HOLD THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN HIS HAND
WAS THY FRIEND WELL IN THY DREAM THE NURSE ASKED
NO HE SAID NO
OH DADDY DO COME--YOU'LL BE SORRY AFTERWARDS IF YOU DON'T IF MR ROSCOE DOESN'T MIND THEN SAID HER FATHER INDULGENTLY
TIMES FLY TIME FLIES NOT THAT WAS ALL HE HEARD THOUGH HE HEARD CONFUSEDLY THAT THERE WAS MORE
RICHARD IS ASLEEP I SUPPOSE I SUPPOSE SO MY LORD SAID BEALE SLEEPY AND PUZZLED
WHAT WEEPING MY LAMB THE NURSE SAID AND CAME TO HIM
IT'S THE CLEVERNESS I THINK OF MOST HE SAID ADMIRINGLY
BUT MAYBE I WILL TEACH THEE A LITTLE SPELL TO BRING IT ON ANOTHER DAY
I MUST AVE IT ALL OUT OR BUST
WELL HE KNEW WHAT POOR PEOPLE WANTED
DON'T LET'S GO TO THAT THERE DOSS
JUST A TIDDY BIT P'RAPS SAID DICKIE BRAVELY BUT I CAN STICK IT WE'LL GET SUMMAT WITH WHEELS FOR YOU TO-MORROW SAID THE MAN IF IT'S ONLY A SUGAR-BOX
ONE OF THE COUSINS GOES WITH HIS MOTHER TO BE HER PAGE AND BEAR HER TRAIN AT THE KING'S REVELS AT WHITEHALL AND THE OTHER MUST SIT AND SEW HER SAMPLER
DICKIE'S REPLY WAS NATURALLY DICKIE HARDING WHY SAID THE NURSE OPENING WIDE EYES AT HIM UNDER GRAY BROWS YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN IT
DICKIE FELT AN ODD SENSATION OF FIXEDNESS
THE CHESTS MUST HAVE BEEN PUSHED OR PULLED THROUGH
AND WHAT A PLAY-PLACE IT WAS THAT SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM--GREEN AND GLORIOUS WITH THE SEA ON ONE SIDE AND THE DOWNS ON THE OTHER AND IN THE MIDDLE THE RUINS OF ARDEN CASTLE
HE CAUGHT AT THE THIRD SHAPE THAT BRUSHED BY HIM
AND THERE THAT LETTER IS TO THIS DAY I HOPE I SHAN'T FORGET IT ALL SAID EDRED
HE TURNED FROM THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT THE TAPESTRY-HUNG ROOM--THE BIG BED THE PLEASANT WRINKLED FACE OF THE NURSE--AND HE KNEW THAT ALL THIS WAS AS REAL AS ANYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM IN THAT OTHER LIFE WHERE HE WAS A LITTLE LAME BOY WHO TOOK THE ROAD WITH A DIRTY TRAMP FOR FATHER AND LAY IN THE BED WITH GREEN CURTAINS
ALSO HE TRANSPLANTED TWO OF THE PRIMROSES WHOSE FACES WANTED WASHING
HOW'D I COME ERE
ONLY THEIR FATHER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE
I WISH I COULD BRING HIM HERE NOT YET SAID THE NURSE SURPRISINGLY
AND THEN THE NURSE CAUGHT THEM AND RICHARD WAS SENT TO BED
YOU SEE I'VE SETTLED BEALE IN LIFE
AND WHEN HE WOKE IN THE LITTLE PANELLED ROOM IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT ALL THIS WAS ONLY DREAMS AND FANCIES
ELFRIDA AND EDRED SAID NOTHING
YOU BE A BOLD LAD BY MY FAITH SO YOU BE
NO SAID DICKIE AND HID HIS FACE AGAINST BEALE'S COAT SLEEVE
DICKIE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN A GRAY AND A GRAY IT WAS
YOU SAID IT MADE ME FORGET THINGS
BUT I KNOWS WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT THAT
BUT I AM AFRAID SHE WAS NOT VERY PARTICULAR AND SHE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SEND DICKIE TO SLEEP SO THAT HE COULD NOT BETRAY HER OR HER GARDENER FRIEND UNTIL HE WAS VERY FAR AWAY FROM BOTH OF THEM
OUT OF AN OPENING AT THE UPPER END A STREAM OF WATER FELL AND RAN ALONG THE CAVE CLEAR BETWEEN SHORES OF SMOOTH SAND
HE GOT THE OLD WORN-DOWN KNIFE OUT OF THE BOWL ON THE BACK KITCHEN SINK WHERE IT NESTLED AMONG POTATO PEELINGS LIKE A FLOWER AMONG FOLIAGE AND CAREFULLY CUT HALF A DOZEN OF THE SMALLER FLOWERS
AND DREAMS ABOUT THIS PLACE TAKE NONE OF WHAT IS TIME IN THAT OTHER PLACE BUT MY DREAM ENDURED ALL NIGHT OBJECTED DICKIE
OR SHOULD HE IF HE COULD CLIMB UP AND HIDE ON THE BOXES AND TAKE HIS CHANCE OF DISCOVERY ON THE LIFT
ANYBODY UD THINK THE DOGS WAS BABBIES TO HEAR YOU SO THEY ARE--TO ME--AS PRECIOUS AS ANYWAY
IT AIN'T MY WORK NEITHER AND I AIN'T SO USED TO WASHING AS WHAT YOU ARE AND THAT'S THE TRUTH SO SHE WASHED HIM NOT VERY GENTLY
AND AT LAST HE REALLY DID ARRANGE A SCHEME FOR GETTING ELFRIDA OUT OF THE TOWER--A PERFECTLY WORKABLE SCHEME
HE HAS MADE ARDEN THE HAPPIEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS VILLAGE IN ENGLAND AND THE STREAM BESIDE WHICH DICKIE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS COUSINS FLOWS A BROAD MOAT ROUND THE WATERS OF THE CASTLE RESTORED NOW TO ALL ITS OWN SPLENDOR
YOU MUST TAKE YOUR CHANCE OF THAT WILL YOU HELP ME DICKIE ASKED
IT WILL BE THERE
BUT HE KEPT VERY CLOSE TO HIM AND HE KEPT HIS EYES ON THE BOX
NOW HASTE AND DRESS--AND THEN BREAKFAST AND THY FENCING LESSON WHEN THE FENCING LESSON WAS OVER DICKIE HESITATED
YOU THINK PERHAPS THAT HE WAS HAPPY AS WELL AS PROUD FOR PROUD HE CERTAINLY WAS WITH THOSE WORDS AND THOSE CHEERS RINGING IN HIS EARS
HAD ONLY SO FAR AS HE COULD REMEMBER BEEN LOVED BY BEALE AND BY THAT SHADOWY FATHER HIS DADDY WHO HAD DIED IN HOSPITAL AND DYING HAD GIVEN HIM THE RATTLE HIS TINKLER THAT WAS HARDING'S LUCK
HE LAID IN BED AND HEARD JOLLY VOICES TALKING AND SINGING IN THE KITCHEN BELOW
YOU ALWAYS COULD STICK IT ON SAID MR BEALE ADMIRINGLY
THE MAN FELL WRENCHING THE BLADE FROM DICKIE'S HAND
I'LL GO AFORE SAID THE MOULDIWARP YOU COME ARTER
IF A LIFETIME OF REPENTANCE CAN ATONE AND SO ON
SO HE SHOUTED FROM THE GATE SOMETHING ABOUT BACK PRESENTLY AND WENT OFF ALONG THE CART TRACK TOWARDS ARDEN CASTLE AND LOOKED AT IT QUITE CLOSELY
IT WAS GOOD OF HER TO KEEP DICKIE EVEN IF SHE WASN'T VERY KIND TO HIM
AND THEN FIRST CHANCE YOU GET YOU SLIP AWAY FROM EM AND GO TO THE STATION
IT'S A RUIN THIS IS
HE WAS HAPPY AS A PRINCE IS HAPPY NEW-COME TO HIS INHERITANCE AND IT WAS MR BEALE AFTER ALL WHO WAS THE FIRST TO REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A CARRIAGE IN WHICH A TIRED LITTLE BOY MIGHT RIDE
THEY HAVEN'T THE CHARM
YOU LIKE COUNTRY BEST DON'T YER YES SAID DICKIE
THEIR MEDICINES ARE FOR STRONG MEN THE IDEA OF BLEEDING WAS NOT PLEASANT TO DICKIE THOUGH HE DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHAT IT MEANT
OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS OF GRANBY STOOD A VAN AND THE HORSES HEADS WERE TURNED AWAY FROM LONDON
AND--HERE WE ARE SAID MR BEALE STOPPING IN A SIDE-STREET AT AN OPEN DOOR FROM WHICH YELLOW LIGHT STREAMED WELCOMINGLY
HE HAD SEEN A SCENE JUST LIKE THAT WHERE THE OLD MAN SAT IN THE SUN AND THE PRODIGAL RETURNED
DICKIE'S FACE LOOKED PINCHED AND WHITE
STILL WE CAN'T PICK NOR CHOOSE WHEN IT'S DANGER LIKE DIS ERE
AND THE ARDENS
AND YOU'RE ON A VISIT NOW TO YOUR COUSINS AT YOUR UNCLE'S TOWN HOUSE
FATHER BY ADOPTION AND LOVE
BUT YOU KNOW THAT NOW THEY HAVE USED THEIR MAGIC TO GET BACK THEIR FATHER AND CAN NO LONGER USE IT TO LOOK FOR TREASURE
THE NURSE WAS VERY PATIENT WITH HIS FORGETTINGS
DON'T YOU FORGET TO EAT YOUR DINNER WHEN THE SUN COMES LEVEL THE TOP OF THAT HIGH TREE
NOT BUT WHAT IT'S A VERY GOOD SEAL HE ADDED VERY GOOD INDEED SEE HERE SAID DICKIE SUDDENLY I KNOW WHAT HONOR IS NOW AND THE WORD OF A GENTLEMAN
HE GOT OUT INTO THE GARDEN--THERE STOOD THE STALK OF THE FLOWER VERY TALL IN THE DEEPENING DUSK
AN ERE'S ME AN ERE'S YOU AN ERE'S THE PICK OF THE DOGS
FRIED EGGS AND BACON--HE HAD ONE EGG AND THE MAN HAD THREE--BREAD AND BUTTER--AND IF THE BREAD WAS THICK SO WAS THE BUTTER--AND AS MANY CUPS OF TEA AS YOU LIKED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
HE HAD NO DOUBT BUT THAT IT WAS THE POLICEMAN COME TO TAKE HIM UP FOR BEING IN A HOUSE THAT WAS NOT HIS
AND HE'LL PUT YOU DOWN AT WHATEVER STATION YOU SAY HERE DON'T FORGET IS BREAKFAST SAID MARKHAM REACHING HER ARM THROUGH THE WINDOW
CHEER FOR HIM MEN AS YOU NEVER CHEERED BEFORE
LEAN ON ME THEY GOT HIM UP TO THE PASSAGE ONE ON EACH SIDE AND BY THAT TIME DICKIE COULD USE HIS LEGS AND HIS CRUTCH
COULD BOW LIKE A COURTIER AND SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN AND PLAY A SIMPLE AIR ON THE VIOL THAT HUNG IN THE PARLOR FOR GUESTS TO AMUSE THEMSELVES WITH WHILE THEY WAITED TO SEE THE MASTER OR MISTRESS
AND I DON'T LIKE ADVENTURES NEARLY SO MUCH AS I USED TO THINK I DID
IT WAS A BILL--HE HAD HAD IT IN HIS HAND WHEN HE MADE THE MAGIC MOON-SEED PATTERN AND IT HAD UNACCOUNTABLY COME WITH HIM
IT'S IM WHISPERED DICKIE SETTING DOWN THE MUG
HE KNOWS ME
THEN YOU ARST AGAIN
I KNOWS YOU'RE STRAIGHT NOW EVEN IF IT DIDN'T BEGIN JUST LIKE THAT
AN I CAN TIE THAT LEG OF YOURS UP TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AS IF IT WAS CUT OFF IT'S THIS ERE NASTY BOOT AS MAKES ME TIRED SAID DICKIE
I HAVEN'T TIME
YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE DAYS
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE TREASURE WITHOUT WAKING THE MOULDIESTWARP WHO SITS ON THE GREEN-AND-WHITE CHECKERED FIELD OF ARDENS SHIELD OF ARMS
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT WE MUST DO SOMETHING ELFRIDA SAID IMPATIENTLY
THEY HAD BEEN SITTING THERE ALL THE MORNING AND DICKIE HAD TOLD MR BEALE ALL HIS EARTHLY ADVENTURES FROM THE MOMENT THE REDHEADED MAN HAD LIFTED HIM UP TO THE WINDOW OF TALBOT COURT TO THE TIME WHEN HE HAD COME IN BY THE OPEN DOOR OF THE COMMON LODGING-HOUSE
HE NEVER RETURNED
THERE WAS NO GRASS NEAR ONLY ROUGH TRAMPLED EARTH
NEXT MORNING QUITE EARLY THEY TOOK THE ROAD
AND TO-MORROW WE'LL DECIDE ON THE UNLIKELIEST AND GO THERE
BUT THEN DICKIE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY CHILD OR NONE OF THESE ADVENTURES WOULD EVER HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM
AND I'LL SELL EM FOR THRIBBLE THE MONEY YOU SEE IF I DON'T
WHY ONLY LAST MONTH A BRUTE OF A DOG BIT ME IN THE LEG AT A BACK DOOR SUTTON WAY
BUT I MUST HAVE MY FARE TO GRAVESEND
AS IF IT WASN'T JUST AS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE UNLIKELY PLACES AS THE LIKELY ONES I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SAID DICKIE
IF E GETS A BIT FAT E MAKES IT UP IN CLEVERNESS
AND THEN THE LADY SAID SEVERAL THINGS VERY QUICKLY BEGINNING WITH I TOLD YOU SO EDWARD AND ENDING WITH I KNEW HE WASN'T A COMMON CHILD DICKIE MISSED THE MIDDLE PART OF WHAT SHE SAID BECAUSE OF THE WAY HIS EGG BEHAVED SUDDENLY BURSTING ALL DOWN ONE SIDE AND RUNNING OVER INTO THE SALT WHICH OF COURSE HAD TO BE STOPPED AT ALL COSTS BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER
I NEVER BIN HERE BEFORE DON'T WANDER I TELL YOU REPEATED THE NURSE BRISKLY
AN YOU DO WANT TO GET OUT OF IT DON'T YOU NO ERROR SAID DICKIE
NOT BEFORE THE CHILDREN
LIE STRAIGHT AND STILL SHE SAID AND WISH THYSELF WHERE THOU WAST WHEN THOU LEFTEST THAT DREAM HE DID SO
THE BOW-FRONTED SHINING SIDEBOARD WITH HANDLES THAT SHONE LIKE GOLD AND THE CORNER CUPBOARD WITH GLASS DOORS AND CHINA INSIDE RED AND BLUE AND GOLDY
OH FATHER NOT A LITTLE HORSE IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR ONE'S FATHER LAUGH THAT BIG JOLLY LAUGH--TO FEEL ONE'S FATHER'S ARM LAID LIKE THAT ACROSS ONE'S SHOULDERS
THE TALBOTS AIN'T BEEN GENTRY MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS
FOUR PLATES TWO CUPS AND SAUCERS TWO EACH OF KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS A TIN TEAPOT A QUART JUG A PAIL A BIT OF KIDDERMINSTER CARPET HALF A POUND OF YELLOW SOAP A SCRUBBING-BRUSH AND BROOM TWO TOWELS A KETTLE A SAUCEPAN AND A BAKING-DISH AND A PINT OF PARAFFIN
WHAT AN ADVENTURE
AND THY COUSINS LOVE HIM NO BETTER THAN THOU DOST
NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON
IT WAS NOT HIS PET KIND OF MAGIC
YOU BE A GOOD BOY MATEY AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD
QUITE AT THE BEGINNING DIDN'T WE ELF AND ELFRIDA AGREED THAT THIS WAS SO
DICKIE FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE DOOR BELOW THE WINDOW FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIS COUSINS FORGOT THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE AND THAT IT WAS NOW HIS BUSINESS TO GET HIMSELF AND THE OTHERS SAFELY BACK TO THEIR OWN TIMES
SO HE HAD GAINED SOMETHING
BUT WE DON'T OFTEN USE EM--'CAUSE WHY
AND ADDED THAT KENT MADE 615 AGAINST DERBYSHIRE LAST THURSDAY
AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE DOCKYARD HIS OBLIGING FEET CARRIED HIM TO A MAN IN A GREAT LEATHER APRON BUSY WITH GREAT BEAMS OF WOOD AND TOOLS THAT DICKIE HAD NEVER SEEN
SEE BUT THAT WAS BEFORE LORD ARDEN HAD HIS SECOND TALK WITH MR BEALE
WHEN THE LONG TALE ENDED THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO GO DOWN TOWARDS ITS BED IN THE WEST
MY DEAR BOY SAID THE FATHER OF EDRED AND ELFRIDA I DID VERY WELL WITHOUT THE TITLE AND THE CASTLE AND IF THEY'RE YOURS I SHALL DO VERY WELL WITHOUT THEM AGAIN
THE BEAUTIFUL BOOK LAY ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM BUT HE NO LONGER SAW IT
DICKIE WONDERED WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A BONFIRE TO-NIGHT
HE STUMBLED ON A BIG STONE AND WOULD HAVE FALLEN BUT THAT BEALE CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM AND AS HE SWUNG ROUND BY THAT ARM BEALE SAW THAT THE BOY'S EYES WERE THICK WITH TEARS
I DIDN'T MEAN NO GOOD TO YOU NOT AT FIRST I DIDN'T SAID BEALE WHEN YOU WROTE ON THE SOLE OF MY BOOT
YOU MEAN TO STAY A LONG TIME THEN SAID DICKIE
HE LAY IN BED--A BIG STRANGE BED--IN A ROOM THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
WELL SAID BEALE SHEEPISHLY WHAT IF I DID YOU'VE SPOILED EVERYTHING SAID DICKIE FURIOUS AND HE FLUNG THE TWO NEWLY FINISHED BOXES VIOLENTLY TO THE GROUND AND SAT FROWNING WITH EYES DOWNCAST
LOOK HOW FLUSHED HE IS I WANTED TO SAID DICKIE
IT WAS A RATTLE--A BABY'S OLD-FASHIONED RATTLE--OR IF YOU WOULD RATHER CALL IT THAT A CORAL AND BELLS AND WE SHALL AVE THE FAIREST FLOWERS OF HILL AND DALE SAID DICKIE WHISPERING COMFORTABLY IN HIS DIRTY SHEETS AND GREENSWARD
I AM GLAD THOU'ST WELL OF THY FEVER RICHARD
I'LL CUT THE CORDS HE CUT THEM AND DICKIE TRIED TO STAND UP
NOW SHE SAID MASTER RICHARD WILL GO TAKE OFF HIS FINE SUIT AND HE DID NOT HEAR THE END FOR HE WAS PUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM
LOOK ERE FATHER LET US GO BOTH TWO OF US AND SLEEP IN THAT THERE OLD OUSE OF OURS
IT'S WORTH MORE THAN WHAT I LENT YOU THE MAN SAID AT LAST WITH AN EFFORT
PON MY SAM I BELIEVE YOU LIKE WORK SAID MR BEALE IN TONES OF INTENSE ASTONISHMENT
LET HIM SAID DICKIE TO HIMSELF
HE MUST NOT JUST DISAPPEAR EITHER OR THEY WOULD SEARCH AND SEARCH FOR HIM AND NEVER KNOW THAT HE WAS GONE FOREVER
I SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ANY DREAM COULD HAVE MADE ME FORGET ABOUT MY FOOT FOR HE HAD INDEED FORGOTTEN IT HAD LEAPED UP EAGERLY CONFIDENTLY AS A SOUND CHILD LEAPS AND THE LAME FOOT HAD BETRAYED HIM THROWN HIM DOWN
DICKIE LIMPED ALONG IN THE DUST THE WORLD SEEMED VERY BIG AND HARD
ONE OF THOSE IN THE IRON BOX
YES HE SAID I SHALL MIND FRIGHTFULLY
COME OUT DEARIE
IT WAS A LONG AND VERY BEAUTIFUL DAY THE FIRST THAT DICKIE HAD EVER SPENT ALONE
BEALE FROWNED
BESIDES BEALE HAD BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE LOVED HIM
YOU CAN TAKE THIS CHANCE
HE GRASPED THE REINS AND GUIDED THE STRANGE STEED TO A LOW SWOOP THAT SHOULD BRING HIM NEAR THE FLARE OF TORCHES IN THE STREET OUTSIDE THE GREAT FRONT DOOR
WHEN DICKIE CAME BACK WITHOUT MUSHROOMS THE RED-WHISKERED MAN WAS GONE
HE PUT HIS BEDROOM CANDLE AND MATCHES IN HIS POCKET CREPT DOWN-STAIRS AND OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO BEALE'S
IT'S A CRUEL WORLD
CUT ALONG DOWN TO THE DINING-ROOM
ELFRIDA IF YOU'RE GOING TO BOTHER IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH THAT'S ALL YOU REALLY MUSTN'T TELL ME I'VE TOLD YOU SO FIFTY TIMES HE SAID
THEN EDRED WAS GLAD OF HIS BEDROOM CANDLE
I SUPPOSE SO SAID EDRED GRUMPILY
NOT IM AND US SUCH PALS AS NEVER WAS AND IS JAW WAGGING ALL DAY LONG
IF YOU COME TO THINK OF IT BURGLING MUST BE A VERY EXCITING PROFESSION
AND THEN SUDDENLY HE WAS NO LONGER THE CLEVER PERSON WHO HAD MANAGED EVERYTHING SO ADMIRABLY--WHO WAS LIVING TWO LIVES WITH SUCH CREDIT IN BOTH WHO WAS MANAGING A GROWN MAN FOR THAT GROWN MAN'S GOOD
HE HAD DONE WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO
AND THE NIGHTS HAD NO DREAMS IN THEM AND IN THE DAYS DICKIE LIVED GAILY AND WORTHILY THE LIFE OF THE SON OF A GREAT AND NOBLE HOUSE AND NOW HE HAD NO PRICKINGS OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT BEALE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE HOUSE IN DEPTFORD
I WON'T
HOW HE HAS GROWN AND THE FINE GENTLEMAN THUMPED HIM ON THE BACK AND BADE HIM BEAR HIMSELF LIKE A GENTLEMAN'S SON AND NOT LIKE A QUEASY SQUARE-TOES AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED AND HE CRIED A LITTLE AND THE TUTOR SEEMED TO BE BLOTTED OUT AND THERE THEY WERE ALL THREE AS JOLLY AS IF THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER ALL THEIR LIVES
GIMME SAID DICKIE LEANING AGAINST THE COUNTER AND POINTING A GRIMY THUMB AT THE WONDER--"GIMME A PENN'ORTH O THAT THERE GOT THE PENNY THE SHOPMAN ASKED CAREFULLY
NOW I MUST REMEMBER EXACTLY WHICH WAY TO GO HE TOLD HIMSELF
I'LL LAY OUT THE MOON-SEEDS AND THINGS ON THE FLOOR HERE--YOU'LL SEE SO DICKIE MADE THE CROSSED TRIANGLES OF MOON-SEEDS AND HE AND HIS COUSINS STOOD IN IT AND DICKIE SAID PLEASE CAN WE SEE THE MOULDIERWARP JUST AS YOU SAY PLEASE CAN I SEE MR SO-AND-SO WHEN YOU HAVE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF MR SO-AND-SO'S HOUSE AND SOME ONE HAS OPENED THE DOOR
YOU DON'T KID ME SO EASY I AIN'T ARSTIN YOU FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT THE WAY SAID DICKIE
YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND TO ME
OH THAT'S PART OF THEIR MAGIC
AND NOW THEY WERE REALLY ON THE ROAD
DON'T YOU GET SHIRTY IF I TALKS ABOUT THAT DREAM HE SAID
DICKIE TOOK IT EAGERLY
THE TUTOR DID NOT SEEM TO LIKE DICKIE EITHER
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID BEALE
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED HOW KIND PEOPLE ARE DICKIE THOUGHT AND REACHED HIS HANDS TO SLENDER WHITE HANDS THAT WERE HELD OUT TO HIM
THAT'S ALL SO I'M SENDING TO HER BY THIS POST AND IT'S AN AWFUL TOSS UP GETTING MARRIED BUT MELIA AIN'T LIKE A STRANGER AND IT COULDN'T EVER BE THE SAME WITH US TWO AND NIPPER AFTER ALL THIS SET OUT
I KNOW YOU CAN'T
ALSO THEY SAW THE PORTRAIT OF THE LADY TALBOT WHO HAD BEEN A MISS ARDEN
AND SEE ERE HE SANK HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER
SO DICKIE WENT HIS WAY TO THE KENNELS TO TALK TO THE KENNELMAN
WHY SAID DICKIE IT'S AS BIG AS A DINNER-PLATE IT WAS
NO NEED TO AS YOU SAY
NEVER TURNED A HAIR NO MORE I DIDN'T
US TWO ON THE ROAD MR BEALE WENT ON
I HOPE SOME DAY I SHALL DO YOU A BETTER TURN THAN THE LITTLE YOU MAKE OUT OF MY BOXES AND THINGS THE JEW SOLD THE WROUGHT-IRON BOX THAT VERY WEEK FOR TWENTY GUINEAS
WHEN THEY WENT OUT DICKIE SAID WHAT DID HE WANT FARVER--THAT REDHEADED CHAP BEALE DID NOT AT ONCE ANSWER
WELL I WON'T DECEIVE YOU MATEY
LET'S KEEP HIM TILL CLOSING-TIME AND THEN ONE OF US WILL SEE HIM HOME
IS THAT MY NAME HE ASKED
HE THOUGHT SO HARD THAT HIS THOUGHTS GOT QUITE CONFUSED
LET'S TRY IT ANYWAY ELFRIDA WAS TOO MISERABLE TO ARGUE
HAD NEVER THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE BUT THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO WHOM THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPENED
HE'S ONE OF US
YOU OF COURSE DON'T
DICKIE'S KNOWLEDGE OF AN ORDERED LIFE IN A GREAT HOUSE HELPED HIM TO ORDER LIFE IN A HOUSE THAT WAS LITTLE
FOR HE FELT THAT AS FAR AS A CHILD CAN BE THE EQUAL OF GROWN PEOPLE HE WAS THE EQUAL OF THESE
PRESENTLY TORCHLIGHT GAVE WAY TO DAYLIGHT AS THEY CAME OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR
THE SUMMER COMES WITH FLOWER AND BEE WHERE IS DEAR DICKIE GONE
HE IS INDEED A WORTHY SCION OF THE GREAT HOUSE WE SERVE SAID THE OTHER MOULDIWARP WITH PRECISE AND GENTLE UTTERANCE
THEIR CLOTHES WERE ODDLY BRIGHT
THE DOOR WAS STRONG THERE WAS A BEECH BAR OUTSIDE
THERE IS A REASON SAID EDRED
BUT WE MUST AVE SOME BITS OF STICKS OR ELSE NOBODY WON'T LET US HAVE NO OUSES THEY FLATTENED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE FRONT WINDOW
BUT DICKIE DID NOT ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS PERHAPS YOU OR I WOULD HAVE DONE
HIS LIMPING SURVEY OF THE ROOM ENDED AT THE WINDOWS WHEN THE LADY TURNED SUDDENLY KNELT DOWN PUT HER HAND UNDER HIS CHIN AND LOOKED INTO HIS EYES
THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TRAIN YOU JUST CUT THE STRING WITH THIS ERE LITTLE KNIFE I'LL MAKE YOU A PRESENT OF AND OUT YOU GETS
AND HOW OFTEN HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO INTERRUPT ME WHEN I AM BUSY OH WELL SAID ELFRIDA I ONLY THOUGHT IT WOULD AMUSE YOU DADDY
AND AS THEY LOOKED TWO MEN PICKED UP A GREAT STONE AND STAGGERED FORWARD WITH IT AND LAID IT ON THE STONE FLOOR OF THE SECRET PASSAGE JUST WHERE IT ENDED AT THE EDGE OF THE GRASS
ALL THAT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HE SAID
I KNOW IT'S MOST AWFULLY RUM--BUT IT'S THE REAL TRUE TRUTH RICHARD SAID NOTHING
WHATEVER IS IT SHE ASKED
ALSO HE SHOWED HIS GRATITUDE BY INVITING THE LADY TO LOOK OW SPRY E WAS ON IS PINS BUT SHE ONLY LOOKED A VERY LITTLE WHILE AND THEN TURNED AND GAZED OUT OF THE WINDOW
WHY KING JAMES THE FIRST SAID ELFRIDA AND SUDDENLY THE HORRIBLE TUTOR POUNCED AND GOT ELFRIDA BY THE WRIST
BUT YOU DIDN'T FINISH YOURS
AND IT WAS NICE OF YOU AND I AM PLEASED--AND I DO LOVE THE PUPS--AND WE WON'T SELL ALL THREE WILL US
TRAINED THE DAWG TO OPEN THE DOOR AND BUNK OME
SO THOU'RT AWAKE AT LAST SHE SAID
ON A QUIET EVENING ON THE ROAD BEALE HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO UNTIE HANDS TIED BEHIND THE BACK
WHY IT'S HOURS AND HOURS SINCE YOU AND ME GOT ACQUAINTED
AND THE FORTUNES OF ARDEN'S TENANTRY WILL BE THE FORTUNES OF ARDEN CASTLE ANOTHER CHEER WENT UP
WHAT WONDERS COULD BE DONE FOR BEALE WITH THOSE TWENTY-FIVE GOLD SOVEREIGNS
OR OUGHT TO BE
NOT ME REAL AUNT
AN I THOUGHT YOU'D BE AS PLEASED AS PLEASED--ME ACTIN SO SILLY LIKE AS IF I WAS ONE OF THEM YARNS O YOURN AN ALL
BUT IF IT WAS YOUR OWN MOTHER IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
NO FENSE MEAN TO SAY YOU CAN TALK LIKE A BOOK WHEN YOU LIKE AND CUT IT OFF SHORT LIKE THAT I CAN CON-VERS LIKE LORDS AND LYDIES SAID DICKIE IN THE ACCENTS OF THE GUTTER AND YOUR NOBLE BENEFACTERINESS MADE ME SEEK TO EXPRESS MY FEELINKS WITH THE BEST WORDS AT ME COMMAND FOND OF BOOKS I BELIEVE YOU SAID DICKIE AND THERE WERE NO MORE AWKWARD PAUSES
THESE PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED HIM LOVED HIM BEEN KIND TO HIM WHEN HE WAS ONLY A TRAMP BOY
AVE A LOOK AT MY DAWGS HE SUCCEEDED IN SELLING THE LANDLORD A PUP FOR TEN SHILLINGS AND CAME BACK TO DICKIE SITTING BY THE PLEASANT FIRELIGHT
IT WAS ONLY A MONTH REALLY BUT ALL THE SAME WHAT A LONG TIME
ONLY I SHALL GO BACK TO BEING PLAIN ARDEN I BELIEVE DICKIE IS LORD ARDEN ELFRIDA BEGAN AND I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GONE ON TO GIVE HER REASONS INCLUDING THE WHOLE STORY WHICH THE MOULDIESTWARP HAD TOLD TO DICKIE
YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT DON'T YOU HE SAID GOOD-HUMOREDLY
AND THEN WE GO HOME TO DEPTFORD WITH THEE SAID THE BOY COUSIN
AND SO IT WAS
BUT YOU'VE GOT THE HANG OF IT SOMEHOW
TIS BEST NOT TO SING OF TREASON BUT IT DIDN'T COME OFF YOU KNOW AND HE'S ALWAYS BURNT IN THE END SO ALREADY GUY FAWKES BURNINGS WENT ON
JUST ENJOY YOURSELF AND FORGET THAT YOU EVER HAD ANY RESPONSIBILITIES I'LL TRY HE TOLD HER AND THEN THE OTHERS CAME BACK WITH THEIR PEACHES AND THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD-BYE
ARRIVED THERE IT SEEMED RIGHT TO BOW VERY LOW
ALL THAT HAPPY OTHER LIFE THAT HAD ONCE HELD ALL FOR WHICH HE CARED SEEMED THIN AND DREAM-LIKE BESIDE THE VIVID GLORIES OF THE LIFE HERE NOW
THE WHITE WINGS SPREAD AND THE WHOLE EQUIPAGE ROSE INTO THE AIR UNSEEN BY ANY ONE BUT A ROUNDHEAD SENTINEL WHO WITH GREAT PRESENCE OF MIND GAVE THE ALARM AND WAS KICKED FOR HIS PAINS BECAUSE WHEN THE GUARD TURNED OUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN
AND THEN THE DINNER BELL RANG AND THEY HAD TO GO WITHOUT DICKIE'S TELLING THEM WHAT AND TO EAT ROAST MUTTON AND PLUM-PIE AND BEHAVE AS THOUGH THEY WERE JUST ORDINARY CHILDREN TO WHOM NO MAGIC HAD EVER HAPPENED
I'M ONLY RICHARD ARDEN SAID DICKIE AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO MR BEALE AND STAY WITH HIM FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND THEN TO FIND MY COUSINS BACK THOU GOES THEN SAID THE MOULDY
STOP TRUE
I SHALL NEED TO DIG IT VERY DEEP IF I AM TO CHEAT THREE HUNDRED YEARS
MEN DIE MAN DIES NOT
THEY WERE SO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MONEY HE HAD EVER HANDLED
WHAT YOU SAY
WHAT IS IT DICKIE ASKED SITTING UP ALERT IN A MOMENT
TO TALK OF SUCH DREAMS BRINGS MISFORTUNE
THEN THE GUARD AT THE TOWER GATEWAY WAS CHANGED AND ANOTHER EDRED CAME OUT AND THEY ALL GOT INTO A COACH AND THERE WAS ELFRIDA UNDER THE COACH SEAT AMONG THE STRAW AND OTHER PEOPLE'S FEET AND THEY ALL HUGGED EACH OTHER IN THE DARK COACH AS IT JOLTED THROUGH THE SNOWY STREETS TO ARDEN HOUSE IN SOHO
YOU BEIN A TOFF I THOUGHT YOU'D UNNERSTAND
VERY SOON ALL THE STONES WERE OUT AND THE DOOR WAS DISCLOSED
BUT ALREADY THEY HAVE FOUND OUT THAT A LETTER SIGNED BY A CHILD IS USELESS AND UNLAWFUL
THEY WILL COME AND FIND MY CLOTHES AND THEY'LL THINK I WAS BATHING AND GOT DROWNED I CAN'T BEAR IT SAID ELFRIDA BURSTING INTO SOBS
THE GALLEY WAS DECKED WITH FRESH FLOWERS AND FROM ANOTHER BOAT QUITE NEAR CAME THE SOUND OF MUSIC
NOW IT HAD BOILED AND TWO MAIDS WERE CARRYING IT TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM AS THE DOCTOR HAD SAID
WHEN HE AWOKE HE LAY IN THE BIG FOUR-POST BED WITH THE GREEN AND WHITE CURTAINS
THE ADVENTURE WAS BEGUN
FATHER HE WHISPERED DON'T DO IT
HEMANS I'LL TRY AND HE GOT A PENCIL AND PAPER AND TRY HE DID HIS VERY HARDEST BE SURE
IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THAT BOOK AND DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THESE THINGS--WELL YOU KNOW THEM NOW
IT AIN'T NO GOOD
IT WAS DUSK WHEN HE BADE THEM GOOD-NIGHT EMBRACING EACH DOG IN TURN AND SET OUT TO WALK THE LITTLE WAY TO THE CROSSROADS WHERE THE DOG-CART RETURNING FROM CLIFFVILLE WOULD PICK HIM UP
WE MAY KEEP HIM MAYN'T WE MR ROSENBERG THEY SAID
GETS IS OWN MEALS AND LARKS ABOUT ON IS OWN HOW BEAUTIFUL SAID DICKIE WRIGGLING WITH DELIGHT
THE NOBLE DEED 250 XI
HE PULLED IT OUT
AND THAT'S JUST WHY WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO PROVE THAT DICKIE IS THE RIGHTFUL HEIR SO THAT WHETHER HE HAS THE TITLE OR I HAVE IT YOU AND I MAY NEVER HAVE TO REPROACH OURSELVES FOR HAVING LEFT A SINGLE STONE UNTURNED TO GIVE HIM HIS RIGHTS--WHATEVER THEY ARE AND YOU YOURS DADDY AND ME MINE
THE LOCK PLATE BORE THE ARMS OF ARDEN AND THE DOOR WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN
SO THERE
SO THERE
AND DICKIE OF DEPTFORD HAS THE HONOR OF THE HOUSE OF ARDEN TO UPHOLD THERE AS HERE THEN AS NOW I SHALL CALL MYSELF ARDEN WHEN I GO BACK SAID DICKIE PROUDLY
IN WITH YOU
LET'S GET A BRACE O KIPPERS AND MAKE A NIGHT OF IT SO THEY WENT BACK TO THE GRAVESEND LODGING-HOUSE
I SAY HE CRIED YOU'RE THE NURSE I'VE NURSED A MANY IN MY TIME SHE CALLED BACK
TO LIMP ALONG THE LEAFY WAYS TO CRAWL UP AND DOWN THE CARVED STAIRCASE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PLEASURE GREATER THAN ANY DICKIE HAD EVER KNOWN
I WISH YOU JOY OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE MY BOY SAID LORD ARDEN WHEN HE HAD READ THE LETTER
IT'S LOW--THAT'S WHAT IT IS
HE CROUCHED BEHIND THE OPEN DOOR AND HEARD THE SOFT PAD-PAD OF THE THREE MEN'S FEET ON THE STONES OF THE PASSAGE GROW FAINTER AND FAINTER
I MEAN HE EXPLAINED NOTICING MR BEALE'S OPEN MOUTH AND EYES MORE LOBSTER-LIKE THAN EVER--"I MEAN THAT'S ALL RIGHT FARVER AND YOU SEE IT DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME
THOU KNOWEST HOW FOLK LIVE IN DEPTFORD IN THY TIME--HOW ALL THE GREEN TREES ARE GONE AND GOOD WORK IS GONE AND PEOPLE DO BAD WORK FOR JUST SO MUCH AS WILL KEEP TOGETHER THEIR WORN BODIES AND DESOLATE SOULS
BY TEA-TIME THE WATER IN THE MOAT WAS A FOOT OR MORE DEEP AND WHEN THEY GOT UP NEXT MORNING THE CASTLE WAS SURROUNDED BY A SPLENDID MOAT FIFTY FEET WIDE AND A STREAM RAN FROM IT IN A ZIGZAG WAY IT IS TRUE BUT STILL IT RAN TO THE LOWER ARCH UNDER THE MOUND AND DISAPPEARED THERE TO RUN UNDERGROUND INTO THE SEA
WE'D GET LAGGED FOR A CERT
EDRED AND ELFRIDA TURNED TO GO
THE ACCENT THOUGH STRANGE WAS NOT THE ACCENT OF DEPTFORD STREET BOYS
THE JOLTING OF THE CART DID NOT WORRY DICKIE AT ALL
DICKIE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT EVERY LEAF IN THE HEDGE EVERY BLADE OF GRASS BY THE ROADSIDE
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY CEASED TO REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN OUT OF THEIR OWN TIME INTO THE PAST SO THAT IF THEY WERE TO READ THIS BOOK THEY WOULD THINK IT ALL NONSENSE AND MAKE-UP AND NOT IN THE LEAST RECOGNIZE THE STORY AS THEIR OWN
ON THE COVERLET LAVENDER AND OTHER HERBS WERE LAID
THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO GROW UP BRAVE AND NOBLE AND GENEROUS AND UNSELFISH TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO CALLED HIM MASTER
AND THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT LAME HE FELT--MORE THAN FELT HE KNEW--THAT THE OLD NEW CROSS LIFE HAD NOT BEEN A FEVER DREAM AND THAT BEALE WHO HAD BEEN KIND TO HIM AND TAKEN HIM THROUGH THE PLEASANT COUNTRY AND SLEPT WITH HIM IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS WAS REALLY WAITING FOR HIM AT GRAVESEND
AND WHERE DID YOU SPRING FROM
THEN I'M GLAD I CAME SAID DICKIE
THEN SOME DAY I SHALL DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT FARVER AND SO AT LAST THEY CAME TO NEW CROSS AGAIN AND MR BEALE STEPPED IN FOR HALF A PINT AT THE RAILWAY HOTEL WHILE DICKIE WENT CLICKETY-CLACK ALONG THE PAVEMENT TO HIS FRIEND THE PAWNBROKER
AND THE MONEY IN THE BANK GREW TILL IT SO TO SPEAK BURST THE BANK-BOOK AND HAD TO BE ALLOWED TO OVERFLOW INTO A VAST SEA CALLED CONSOLS
ALL WAS AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
DICKIE PLAYED AT HOUSES UNDER THE TABLE--IT WAS NOT THE SORT OF GAME HE USUALLY PLAYED BUT THE NEIGHBORS COULD NOT KNOW THAT
THERE IS SO OFTEN ROOM IN OUR HEARTS FOR TWO TUNES AT A TIME
AND THE TRIFLE'S AN HUNDRED POUNDS
I WAS ALWAYS LIKE IT FROM A BOY
AN E SAYS YOU'RE A ARDEN BY RIGHTS YOU NIPPER YOU AN E WANTS TO TAKE YOU AND BRING YOU UP ALONG OF HIS KIDS--SO THERE'S AN END OF YOU AND ME DICKIE OLD BOY
THERE'S THE WAY OF EVERYTHING--THE EARTH SHE SAID
YOU WILL NEED A KNIFE TO CUT CORDS WITH
AND THEN THE MAGIC BEGAN
PRESENTLY THERE WERE VOICES BELOW VOICES COMING UP THE STAIRS--THE NURSE'S VOICE HIS COUSINS AND ANOTHER VOICE
HE PICKED UP THE COINS PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET--FELT THE MOON-SEEDS
THAT'S WOT YOU DO THANKEE DADDY SAID BEALE AN SO I WILL HE SLIPPED THE BOX IN HIS POCKET
AND TO-MORROW WE'LL SLEEP IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS I SEE THAT THERE IN A BOOK SAID DICKIE CHARMED
BUT IT DID NOT COME--EVEN SLEEP PLAIN RESTFUL DREAMLESS SLEEP WOULD NOT COME TO HIM
IT WAS MIND-SLEEPINESS--DICKIE HAD GONE THROUGH SO MUCH IN THE LAST THIRTY-SIX HOURS THAT HIS POOR LITTLE BRAIN FELT QUITE WORN OUT
YES ISN'T HE MOTHER SAID THE LITTLE GIRL
AND BEALE SAID AWKWARDLY THAT'S ALL RIGHT MATE YOU PRETTY FLUSH THE BOY ASKED LATER ON
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
DON'T BE HARD ON HIM FOR LONGING FOR JUST THIS LITTLE HUMAN PRAISE THERE ARE VERY FEW OF US WHO CAN DO WITHOUT IT
BUT IF YOU BRING THEM INTO YOURS IT'S QUITE ANOTHER PAIR OF SLEEVES
DICKIE'S BRAIN FELT FAT--SWOLLEN--AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND HE WAS GLAD TO GO TO BED--EVEN IN THAT CUPBOARDY PLACE WITH THE PANELS
COULD HE REALLY TRUST AMELIA
YET THE THOUGHT OF THOSE DAYS WHEN HE WAS PLAIN RICHARD ARDEN SON OF SIR RICHARD ARDEN LIVING IN THE BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AT DEPTFORD FRETTED AT ALL HIS JOY IN HIS PRESENT STATE
IN THE DREAM I'D GOT LOTS OF THINGS
FOR THIS WAS IT SEEMED THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER THE DAY ON WHICH THE GUNPOWDER PLOT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT
BUT THE POLICE KNOW ALL SORTS OF THINGS--ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE I KNOW AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING--EVEN WHEN THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING THE PLEECE KNOWS A JOLLY SIGHT TOO MUCH SAID DICKIE IN GLOOM
HE FELT THAT STRANGE THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE AND THAT HE MUST KNOW WHAT THEY WERE
FATHER SAID DICKIE NEXT MORNING AS MR BEALE STRETCHED AND GRUNTED AND RUBBED SLEEPY EYES WITH HIS UNWASHED FISTS IN THE COLD DAYLIGHT THAT FILLED THE FRONT ROOM OF 15 LAVENDER TERRACE ROSEMARY LANE
WE'LL TRY IT AND THEY DID TRY IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED
THEY NEVER SAW THAT DOG AGAIN
DICKIE HAD NEVER SEEN DRESSING-GOWNS BEFORE
SAYS HE DON'T REMEMBER WHERE TO
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS TRUE
DICKIE AT NEW CROSS HAD SPENT MANY AN HOUR WATCHING THOSE INTERESTING MEN WHO OPEN SQUARE TRAP-DOORS IN THE PAVEMENT AND DRAG OUT FROM THEM YARDS AND YARDS OF WIRE
E DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LIKE WHEN I MET IM
ONE MAN WHO HAD NO GRIDIRON COOKED A PIECE OF STEAK ON THE KITCHEN TONGS
AFTER THIS HE TALKED WITH THE NURSE EVERY DAY AND LEARNED MORE AND MORE WONDERS OF WHICH THERE IS NO TIME NOW FOR ME TO TELL YOU
INSTEAD HE FOUND NEXT DAY WHEN HIS AUNT HAD GONE OUT SHOPPING A LITTLE SQUARE OF CARDBOARD AT THE BACK OF THE DRESSER DRAWER AMONG THE DIRTY DUSTERS AND CLOTHES PEGS AND STRING AND CORKS AND NOVELETTES
I'M A-GOIN TO SHOW YOU
AND HE WALKED SLOWLY AND HEAVILY UP THE PATH AND SAID HULLO DAD!--HOW GOES IT AND THE OLD MAN LOOKED AT HIM WITH HIS EYES HALF SHUT AND SAID WHY IT IS JAMES--SO IT IS AS IF HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE SOME ONE QUITE DIFFERENT
YOU ARE TO BURY YOUR TREASURE UNDER THE WINDOW OF THE SOLAR PARLOR AND LIE DOWN AND SLEEP ON IT
AND HOW SILLY IF I WERE A GROWN MAN IN THAT LIFE AND HAD TO COME BACK AND BE A LITTLE BOY IN THIS I DO NOT PRETEND THAT THE IDEA DID NOT OCCUR TO DICKIE NOW THAT BEALE IS FAIRLY STARTED HE COULD DO VERY WELL WITHOUT ME BUT DICKIE KNEW BETTER
SHE DRESSED HIM HURRIEDLY AND CARRIED HIM AND HIS CRUTCH DOWN THE BACK STAIRS AND INTO THAT VERY BUTLER'S PANTRY THROUGH WHOSE WINDOW HE HAD CREPT AT THE BIDDING OF THE RED-HAIRED MAN
LORD ARDEN 275 XII
HE LOOKED UP
WHEN DICKIE LIVED MISERABLY AT DEPTFORD HE ALWAYS LONGED TO GO TO THOSE OLD TIMES AS A MAN WHO IS UNHAPPY AT HOME MAY WISH TO TRAVEL TO OTHER COUNTRIES
I COULD DOSS ERE AGAIN HE SAID WISTFULLY
CAUSE I TOOK TO YOU THE VERY FIRST DAY
WHO CAN BEAR NOT TO LET SOME ONE VERY NEAR AND DEAR KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEHAVED RATHER DECENTLY ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE DONE
HOLD YER NOISE SAID A VOICE
NO--A SWAN WITH WIDE WHITE WINGS
AND HE GAVE FIVE POUNDS FOR THE WROUGHT-IRON BOX AND OWNED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE--A VERY LITTLE--OUT OF IT
WHERE DO YOU LEARN SUCH TALK IT'S THE WYE THEY TALK IN BOOKS SAID DICKIE SUDDENLY RETURNING TO THE LANGUAGE OF HIS AUNT
THEY COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CARRIED
YOU'VE SEEMED TO BE HERE LEARNING AND PLAYING AND DOING EVERYTHING LIKE YOU USED
AND THEY LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE EDRED AND ELFRIDA WHOM HE HAD PLAYED WITH AND QUARRELLED WITH IN THE DREAM
I'M A BIT OT IN THE OOF MESELF
YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THING
MY LITTLE SON
I SHOULD BE MIXED UP WITH THE HOUSE
DIDN'T LADY TALBOT ASK ME TO BE HER BOY--AND DIDN'T I CUT STRAIGHT BACK TO YOU
THE ARDENS HAD GONE BACK TO THE CASTLE AND DICKIE WITH THEM AND OLD BEALE WAS SMOKING IN HIS USUAL CHAIR BY HIS FRONT DOOR--SO THERE WAS NO ONE TO HEAR BEALE'S COMPLIMENT TO HIS BRIDE
THOU CANST ONLY CHOOSE SOME YEAR IN THE PAST--ANY YEAR--GO INTO IT AND THEN SEEK FOR THE TREASURE THERE AND THEN I'LL DO IT DICKIE SAID AND THEN I MAY COME BACK TO YOU MAYN'T I IF THOU'RT NOT NEEDED ELSEWHERE
THEY SAID I'D BE ABLE TO WALK TO RIGHTS IF I WORE THAT THERE BEASTLY BOOT
AND WE LIE AT OUR GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE
AND SOMETIMES THEY STARVE TO DEATH
WELL THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THEM
YOU OUGHTER BE MARRIED YOU OUGHT E SAYS TO ME PLEASANT LIKE MAN TO MAN
ALL OUTER ONE PIECE SAID THE OLD MAN
AND YOU MUST KEEP THE NOBLER THOUGHT IN YOUR OWN HEART TILL IT IS A NOBLE DEED
HE HALTED LEANING ON HIS CRUTCH FOR THEM TO COME UP AND SPEAK TO HIM
THE GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
AND THE LETTER CAME BACK WITH NOT KNOWN OUTSIDE WHAT ADDRESS WAS IT DICKIE ASKED
NOW SHE STREWED SOMETHING ON THE GLOWING EMBERS
AND THE VERSE
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU GO BACK TO THAT TIME AND SEE IT REALLY WE HADN'T THE CLOTHES
AND SHE CAME QUICKLY
IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY COSTLY BUSINESS IT SEEMS ELFRIDA HEARD HER FATHER SAY TO THE ENGINEER AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO DO IT
WE'LL SEE IT WAS ONLY JUST DAYLIGHT WHEN MARKHAM WOKE HIM
THE OLD NURSE'S HANDS
I CAN'T HELP IT FATHER THAT I'LL WARRANT THOU CANNOT
HE GREW UP WAS TAUGHT A TRADE AND MARRIED A WORKING GIRL
SET OUT THY MOON-SEEDS AND WHEN THOU HEAREST THE VOICES SAY I WOULD SEE BOTH MOULDIWARPS AND THOU SHALT SEE THEM BOTH THANK YOU SAID DICKIE
I AM DEEPLY INTERESTED IN BURIED TREASURE
COULDN'T GET A NIPPER E'S OPPY E IS
COULDN'T GET ME TO SCHOOL SO THEY COULDN'T--ALLUS AFTER BIRDS NESTS OR RABBITS OR THE LIKE
FOLK MUST LOOK TO HAVE CURIOUS DREAMS WHO FALL SICK OF THE FEVER
AND NOW HE WENT OUT TO LOOK
MY LITTLE CHAP E'S LAME LIKE WOT YOU SEE
I SAY YOU ARE GOOD
SEE WELL SAID DICKIE IT'S YOUR LOOKOUT
JUST THEN A CUSTOMER CAME IN--A WOMAN WITH HER SUNDAY DRESS AND A PAIR OF SHEETS TO PAWN BECAUSE HER MAN WAS OUT OF WORK AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUNGRY
BUT YOU'LL TELL ME THE MINUTE YOU CAN WON'T YOU
THEN ANOTHER HURRIED PRESENCE DASHED PAST HIM INTO THE QUIET NIGHT
AN I OFF'S WITH ME COAT AND FLOPS IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PUDDLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GAL PAGE 133 YES SAID DICKIE GO ON AND SHE JUST TOUCHED ME AND AND WALKS ACROSS ME COAT
IT HURT BUT DICKIE LIKED IT PAGE 157 AH YES INDEED SAID THE FATHER
HE LAY THERE A LONG TIME AND IF HE CRIED A LITTLE IT WAS VERY DARK IN THE FUEL HOUSE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HIM
AND THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WHAT I MEAN TO SAY YOU BE A GOOD BOY AND I'LL DO THE RIGHT THING BY YOU I KNOW YOU WILL SAID DICKIE WITH ENTHUSIASM
THOU'ST HEARD THE STORY A THOUSAND TIMES I WANT TO HEAR IT AGAIN DICKIE SAID
T'OTHER TOO IF YOU LIKE
HE WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN SO KIND
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY
WELL ASK SOME GROWN-UP PERSON TO EXPLAIN
STEP OUT SAID ONE OF THE VOICES AND STEP OUT SHARP--SEE?--OR I'LL L'ARN YOU
UNLESS OTHER HANDS HAVE DUG THERE IN THE THREE HUNDRED YEARS
FOR THE BURGLING I MEAN--SHARP--CLEVER--NO ONE TO TOUCH HIM
THE CURTAINS AND A PENN'ORTH OF TACKS A HAMMER BORROWED FROM A NEIGHBOR AND AN HOUR'S CHEERFUL WORK COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S HOUSE AGAINST THE INQUISITIVENESS OF PASSERS-BY
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PRISON YARD HE TOLD HIMSELF
THEY WERE STANDING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER ALL THREE OF THEM IN A NICHE IN A NARROW DARK PASSAGE AND MEN WENT BY THEM CARRYING HEAVY CHESTS AND GREAT SACKS OF LEATHER AND BUNDLES TIED UP IN STRAW AND IN HANDKERCHIEFS
THEIR CHILD WAS THE FATHER OF RICHARD WHOM YOU KNOW
TWENTY-FOUR BOB I MAKE IT LOR SAID MR BEALE WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN
I AM SO SORRY
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
HE WANTED OF COURSE TO HURRY OFF TO SEBASTIAN AND TO GO ON LEARNING HOW TO MAKE A GALLEON
THE BOYS OF OUR HOUSE MY LORD TAKE THAT PRIDE IN IT THAT THEY LEARN OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL WHAT MANY AN EARL'S SON MUST BE DRIVEN TO WITH RODS HE TOOK ME
YOU SEE IT'S OME TO IM LIKE HE ADDED SENTIMENTALLY
NESBIT'S LOVE CONTENTS CHAPTER PAGE I
AND DICKIE SOBBED OUT I AIN'T GOT MY CRUTCH AND I CAN'T GO TO THAT THERE BARF WITHOUT I GOT IT
NOT FOR NOTHING HAD HE WATCHED THE MEN THATCHING THE OAST-HOUSE BY THE MEDWAY
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TREASURE IS ANYHOW
I CALL HIM FATHER BECAUSE HE'S BEEN KIND TO ME
AND HE MAY BE GOING TO BE VERY UNKIND INDEED TO DICKIE WHEN ONCE HE GETS HIM AWAY INTO THE COUNTRY AND IS ALL ALONE WITH HIM--AND HIS HAVING THAT PAPER AND ENVELOPE AND PENCIL ALL READY LOOKS ODD DOESN'T IT
HE MIGHT ADVISE US
LORD ARDEN HAS CERTAINLY DONE WONDERS WITH HIM SO LORD ARDEN GOT THE CREDIT OF ALL THAT DICKIE HAD LEARNED FROM HIS TUTORS IN JAMES THE FIRST'S TIME
EDRED AND ELFRIDA FIRST WENT INTO THE PAST TO LOOK FOR TREASURE
WHOEVER HAS THE CASTLE WILL WANT TO RESTORE IT
CRUTCH SHE SAID
BEALE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DREAM--DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT--HATED IT
THEY GIVE YOU THAT
AND THEY WENT DOWN IN OUR VERY WATERS THEY AND THEIR ARMS AND THEIR TREASURE THEIR GUNS AND THEIR GUNNERS THEIR MARINERS AND THEIR MEN-OF-WAR
AND YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOURSELF
YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS HAD DRESSES FOR OUR MAGIC OR NEARLY ALWAYS
THEY'VE ALWAYS GOT A BIT TO SPARE THEN
BUT I WANT TO TAKE THINGS THERE AND LEAVE THEM THERE SHE KNITTED THOUGHTFUL BROWS
GRAVESEND
WE OUGHT TO HAVE GONE AFTER THOSE MEN THEY DIDN'T GET ANYTHING SHE SAID
THAT'S WHAT I CAN'T STICK SAID DICKIE
I SHALL HAVE TO ECONOMIZE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS THAT'S ALL WHEN ELFRIDA HAD HEARD THIS SHE WENT TO DICKIE AND EDRED WHO WERE FISHING IN THE CAVE AND TOLD THEM WHAT SHE HAD HEARD
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME SOME ANXIETY
YOU WANT US TO PART COMPANY THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
I'D LIKE TO BE A RABBIT YOU MUCH BETTER BE MY LITTLE NIPPER SAID BEALE
THE TABLE HAPPENED TO BE SET DOWN JUST OVER THE HOLE THAT HAD HELD THE ROOTS OF THE MOONFLOWER
I DO LOVE THE MAN NEXT DOOR
DO YOU LIVE HERE HE ASKED CAUTIOUSLY--"ALWAYS I MEAN WHERE ELSE SHOULD I LIVE THE MAN ASKED THAT HAVE SERVED MY LORD YOUR FATHER ALL MY TIME BOY AND MAN AND KNOW EVERY HAIR OF EVERY DOG MY LORD OWNS DICKIE THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD DEAL TO KNOW--AND SO IT WAS
THE SWANS WERE WHITE MAGIC--THE WHITE MOULDIWARP OF ARDEN DID ALL THAT THEN SHE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT THE WHITE MOULDIWARP OF ARDEN AND HOW IT WAS THE BADGE OF ARDEN'S HOUSE--ITS PICTURE BEING ENGRAVED ON TINKLER AND HOW IT HAD DONE ALL SORTS OF MAGIC FOR EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND WOULD DO STILL MORE
IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED TO IM
FAT OBLONG COWS THAT HAD EATEN BURLEY'S CATTLE FOOD STOUT PILLOWS OF WOOL THAT OVIS'S SHEEP SPICE HAD FED AND BRIGHTEST AND BEST OF ALL AN INCREDIBLY SMOOTH-PLUMAGED PARROT RAINBOW-COLORED COCKING A BLACK EYE BRIGHT WITH THE INTOXICATING QUALITIES OF PERROKETT'S ARTISTIC BIRD SEED
I DON'T WANT TO EAR NO MORE ABOUT IM
AND IT WAS SO SMALL AS NOT TO BE MUCH BETTER THAN A CUPBOARD
THERE ARE FRESH SHEETS ON THY BED
THERE'S NO OTHER WINDOW WITH THAT OVER IT
I'LL TELL FATHER I'VE THOUGHT OF ALL THAT DICKIE SAID AND I'M GOING TO ASK THE MOULDIWARPS TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOU CAN'T TELL
I'LL HOLD YOU TO THAT MATEY HE SAID
AND THEN CAME A DAY WHEN ALL THE SERVANTS SEEMED SUDDENLY TO GO MAD--A GREAT RUSHING MADNESS OF MOPS AND BROOMS AND DUSTERS AND PAILS AND EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE ALREADY PERFECTLY CLEAN WAS CLEANED ANEW AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY POLISHED WAS POLISHED FRESHLY AND WHEN DICKIE HAD BEEN TURNED OUT OF THREE ROOMS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HAD TUMBLED OVER A PAIL AND HAD A DISH-CLOTH PINNED TO HIS DOUBLET BY AN ANGRY COOK HE SOUGHT OUT THE NURSE VERY BUSY IN THE LINEN-ROOM AND ASKED HER WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT
PAWNING THE RATTLE SEEMED SUDDENLY TO HAVE BECOME A VERY OLD AND GOOD JOKE BETWEEN THEM
MAY I GIVE THE LITTLE BOY MY PENNY THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE LEFT FACING EACH OTHER THE RICHER BY A PENNY AND OH--WONDERFUL GOOD FORTUNE--A WHOLE HALF-CROWN
NOT A PATTER HAVE I DONE SINCE I DONE THE RALLY AND STARTED IN THE DOG LINE NOR YET NO DEALINGS WITH THAT REDHEADED CHAP WHAT I NEVER SEE NOW IS IT LIKELY BEALE ASKED REPROACHFULLY
BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM THOUGH THEY ROUSED A DOZEN MEN IN THE VILLAGE TO JOIN IN THE SEARCH AND OLD BEALE HIMSELF WHO KNEW EVERY YARD OF THE GROUND FOR FIVE MILES ROUND CAME OUT WITH THE SPANIEL WHO KNEW EVERY INCH OF IT FOR TEN
AND THEN CAME THE DAY WHEN OLD NURSE DRESSED HIM IN HIS BEST--A SUIT OF CUT VELVET PURPLE SLASHED WITH GOLD-COLOR AND A BELT WITH A LITTLE SWORD TO IT AND A FLAT CAP--AND MASTER HENRY THE GAMES-MASTER TOOK HIM IN A LITTLE BOAT TO A GILDED GALLEY FULL OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES ALL FINELY DRESSED WHO KISSED HIM AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND SAID HOW HE WAS GROWN SINCE THE FEVER
NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE HIS OWN
THAT WILL I SAID THE MAN AND THREW UP HIS POINTED BEARD IN A JOLLY LAUGH
I HAVE SPOKEN IT BEGAN TO FADE AWAY BUT ELFRIDA CRIED OH DON'T GO
OH STOW IT HE SAID
HE WENT ON I WISH MY UNCLE MAY RESTORE THE CASTLE AND TAKE CARE OF THE POOR PEOPLE SO THAT THERE AREN'T ANY POOR PEOPLE AND EVERY ONE'S COMFORTABLE JUST AS I MEANT TO DO HE TOOK OFF HIS CAP AND COAT AND FLUNG THEM OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE HIS BOOTS TOO
HE DREW A COMIC PICTURE OF HIS TUTOR--IT REALLY WAS RATHER LIKE--WITH A SCROLL COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND ON THE SCROLL THE WORDS BECAUSE I AM UGLY I NEED NOT BE HATEFUL HIS TUTOR WHO HAD A NASTY WAY OF CREEPING UP BEHIND PEOPLE CAME UP BEHIND HIM AT THE WRONG MOMENT
AND DARTING TO A CORNER PRODUCED A PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERA OF THE KIND CALLED BROWNIE LOOK HERE HE SAID YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE
YES THANK YOU HE SAID AND TRIED TO SIT UP BUT LAY BACK AGAIN BECAUSE THAT WAS SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT
HE DID NOT FEEL AFRAID OF SLEEPING IN AN EMPTY HOUSE ONLY VERY LORDLY AND MAGNIFICENT BECAUSE HE HAD A WHOLE HOUSE TO HIMSELF
IF YOU COULD MAKE UP SOME POETRY NOW EDRED WENT ON WOULD THAT BE ANY GOOD NOT WITHOUT THE DRESSES SHE SNIFFED
WELL THE FACT WAS HE DARED NOT
AND NOW GOOD-BYE SAID RICHARD AND STEPPED INSIDE THE CROSSED TRIANGLES OF MOON-SEEDS
HE SLIPPED FROM UNDER THE PAPER WHOSE RUSTLING DID NOT DISTURB MR BEALE'S SLUMBERS AND MOVED INTO THE SQUARE OF LIGHT THROWN THROUGH THE WINDOW BY THE STREET LAMP
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ENGINEER'S DAY AND NOT THE LAWYER'S
FOR THE TUTOR NEVER LET A DAY PASS WITHOUT TRYING TO FIND OUT WHETHER DICKIE HAD SHARED IN ANY WAY THAT GUILTY KNOWLEDGE OF ELFRIDA'S WHICH HAD SO MR PARADOS INSISTED OVERTHROWN THE FELL PLOT OF THE PAPISTS AND PRESERVED TO A LOYAL PEOPLE HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY JAMES THE FIRST
THAT RED'EADED CHAP WOT YOU NEVER SEE E'LL LIFT YOU UP TO A WINDOW WHAT'S GOT BARS TO IT AND YOU'LL CREEP THROUGH YOU BEING SO LITTLE AND YOU'LL GO SOFT'S A MOUSE THE WAY I'LL SHOW YOU AND UNDO THE SIDE-DOOR
AND HE WAS FOND OF THE HUTCH FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT HAD ONCE LIVED THERE
AND SO THE STORY ENDED THE BREATH OF THE LORD WENT FORTH AND THE STORM BLEW AND FELL ON THE FLEET OF SPAIN AND SCATTERED THEM
IT WAS NO HARDER THAN NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DREAMS YOU HAD LAST NIGHT
AS IT IS WE SHALL HAVE TO PUT YOU INTO YOUR OWN SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE WERE SORRY
E'S WUTH WOT I GIVE FOR IM SO E IS
BUT IT IS ALL WRITTEN IN THE HOUSE OF ARDEN BUT OUR MAGIC IS ALL OVER NOW SAID EDRED SADLY
HI DICKIE SAID A VOICE SURPRISINGLY IN HIS EAR
NOBODY WOULDN'T KNOW WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK TO OUR FOURPENCES SO SHARP'S ALL THAT SAID BEALE
IT'S THIRTY MILE IF IT'S A YARD HE SAID
THEY HAD PUT HIS EMBROIDERED LEATHER BAG OF GOLD IN A LITTLE WROUGHT-IRON COFFER THAT SEBASTIAN HAD GIVEN HIM AND THE NURSE HAD TIGHTLY FASTENED THE JOIN OF LID AND BOX WITH WAX AND RESIN
E AIN'T NEVER BIN CAUGHT
OH NURSE HE CRIED CLINGING TO HER WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
WASH EM YOURSELF SHE SAID AMONG THE SOAP AND SILVER AND MARBLE AND SPONGES
NOT SO DUSTY SAID BEALE SHINING FROM SOAP
ERE'S YOUR COAT MRS BEALE'S VOICE SOUNDED
THE SEEDS CAME RATTLING OUT--DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THEM
IT IS IMPERTINENT OF BEALE AND THOUGHTLESS OF THE BOY HE SAID
WELL SAID ELFRIDA IN TONES OF BRISK COMMONPLACE WHAT DID IT SAY TO YOU
JOAN OF ARC AND PETER THE HERMIT HEREWARD AND DRAKE ELSA WHOSE BROTHERS WERE SWANS ST GEORGE WHO KILLED THE DRAGON BLONDEL WHO SANG TO HIS KING IN PRISON LADY NITHSDALE WHO BROUGHT HER HUSBAND SAFE OUT OF THE CRUEL TOWER
IT WAS A GRAND MOMENT WHEN THE BRICKS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT AND DAYLIGHT POURED INTO THE CAVE AND NOTHING REMAINED BUT TO BREAK DOWN THE DAM AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT OF THE DARKNESS INTO THE SUNSHINE
WHAT A LONG TIME AGO
THOSE CHILDREN CAN'T GET ANY MORE MAGIC OF THEIR OWN NOW BUT YOU COULD TAKE THEM INTO YOURS
NO ONE ELSE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT
SO PRESENTLY HE DECIDED THAT IT WAS COWARDLY TO KEEP LOOKING ROUND AND BESIDES IT ONLY MADE HIM MORE FRIGHTENED
THE OLD LANDS ARE IN THE MARKET
GIVE HER A LIFT WITH HER BASKET SHALL US DICKIE WHISPERED TO MR BEALE AND CLIMBED OUT OF THE PERAMBULATOR
DREAMS AND REAL LIFE WERE SO VERY MUCH ALIKE
NOT VERY CIVIL I DON'T THINK SAID BEALE CONSIDERIN OH SHE'S ALL RIGHT SAID DICKIE WONDERING VERY MUCH AND VERY ANXIOUS THAT BEALE SHOULD NOT WONDER
BUT E'S SUCH A JOLLY LITTLE NIPPER
IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT IN THE END
AS THEY NEARED ORPINGTON THE WOMAN SAID OUR ROAD PARTS HERE
THAT NIGHT DICKIE SLEPT IN SHEETS OF THE FINEST LINEN SCENTED WITH LAVENDER
BUT FOR A POLICEMAN WHO IS USUALLY OF QUITE A LARGE PATTERN THE VOICE WAS UNUSUALLY SOFT AND SMALL
THIS EXTRA HAMPER A DARK HANDSOME BIG-NOSED MAN CAME TOWARDS THEM
E USED TO RIDE ME ON THE BIG CART-HORSES
I LIKE IT BETTER'N CADGIN SAID DICKIE
MR BEALE A FIGURE OF CLEANLY HABIT AND INCREASING STEADINESS SEEMED LIKE A PLANT GROWING QUICKLY TOWARDS THE SUN OF RESPECTABILITY OR A LIGHTHOUSE RISING BRIGHT AND IMPORTANT OUT OF A SWIRLING SEA--OF DOGS
THE SERVANTS CALLED HIM MASTER RICHARD AND HE FELT AS HE HEARD THEM THAT BEING CALLED MASTER RICHARD MEANT NOT ONLY THAT THE SERVANTS RESPECTED HIM AS THEIR MASTER'S SON BUT THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY FROM WHOM GREAT THINGS WERE EXPECTED
CALL THE NURSE TO TAKE HIM SHE SAID
IT'S A RUM GO
WITHOUT IT WAS PIGEONS THEN DICKIE WONDERED WHETHER THINGS THAT YOU LEARNED IN DREAMS WOULD STAY LEARNED THINGS YOU LEARNED TO DO WITH YOUR HANDS
COME COME
BUT IT IRRITATED HER TOO
DICKIE KNEW HIS VOICE EVEN IN THAT VELVET-BLACK DARKNESS
HE SETTLED HIMSELF ON THE BROAD WINDOW-LEDGE AND HELD ON TO THE IRON WINDOW-BARS WHILE THE RED-WHISKERED MAN TOOK OUT A PANE OF GLASS WITH TREACLE AND A HANDKERCHIEF SO THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NOISE OF BREAKING OR FALLING GLASS
JUST THINK THIS OUT WILL YOU AND SEE IF I AM NOT RIGHT
E SAID E'D LEFT SOME TOOLS ERE AND YOU WOULDN'T LET IM AVE THEM YOU SEE SAID THE LADY THE CHILD DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IS IT THE LITTLE GIRL CALLED OUT
THINK OF IT MATEY--THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS AND THE GOOD SMELL OF THE HERRINGS YOU TOASTS YERSELF AND THE FIRE YOU MAKES OUTER STICKS AND THE LITTLE STARSES A-COMIN OUT AND A-WINKIN AT YOU AND ALL SO QUIET A-SMOKIN YER PIPE TILL IT FALLS OUTER YER MOUTH WITH SLEEPINESS AND NO FEAR O SETTIN THE COUNTERPIN AFIRE
NEVER SEE SUCH A NIPPER FOR NOTICING NEITHER
HULLO SAID THE PAWNBROKER HERE WE ARE AGAIN
WHAT IS IT THEN THE NURSE ASKED LAUGHING A FAT COMFORTABLE LAUGH
HANDS FUMBLED HIS FACE WAS CLEARED OF THE CLOAK AND A HANDKERCHIEF WITH A ROUND PEBBLE IN IT WAS STUFFED INTO HIS MOUTH SO THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK
HE WAS NOT CRYING HOWEVER BUT THINKING THINKING THINKING AND TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY OUT WHEN HE HEARD A LITTLE SCRATCH SCRATCHING ON THE CORNER OF THE SHED
BUT IF I'M EXPECTED TO CALL YOU MASTER WHATEVER-YOUR-SILLY-NAME-IS I GIVES A MONTH'S WARNING SO I TELL YOU STRAIGHT I DON'T WANT TO STAY SAID DICKIE--"AT LEAST OH TELL ME ANOTHER SAID THE GIRL IMPATIENTLY AND LEFT HIM WITHOUT HAVING MADE THE SLIGHTEST USE OF THE DUSTER
THEY WERE VERY NICE TO HIM AT THE HOSPITAL BUT WHEN THEY SENT HIM HOME THEY PUT HIS LAME FOOT INTO A THICK BOOT WITH A HORRID CLUMPY SOLE AND IRON THINGS THAT WENT UP HIS LEG
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT DEAR MAY HEAVENS SAID DICKIE SLEEPILY BLESS YOU GENEROUS BEAN FACTRESS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY CHILD SAID THE LADY RETURNING TO HER HUSBAND
MY DEAR LITTLE DICKIE SHE SAID YOU DON'T WISH IT AS MUCH AS I DO THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS A CHAP CAN'T BE SURE OF--THINGS YOU MUSTN'T TELL ANY ONE
IT BLUNTED OVER AND HE TOOK ANOTHER HIDING IN THE CHAPEL DOORWAY WHEN THE MEN CAME BACK WITH THE FOOD
BY SHORT STAGES ENJOYING EVERY STEP OF EVERY DAY'S JOURNEY THEY WENT SLOWLY AND AT THEIR EASE THROUGH THE GARDEN-LAND OF KENT
IT'S WHAT THEY CALL IST'RY DICKIE AFTER SOME REFLECTION SAID D'JEVER EAR OF HERE WARD I KNOWED A JAKE WARD WUNST HERE WARD THE WAKE
TO LOOK FOR SOME TOOLS E MISLAID THERE A YEAR AGO WHEN E WAS ON A PLUMBING JOB--AND THEY WON'T LET IM AVE THEM BACK NOT BY FAIR MEANS THEY WON'T
THIS GENTLEMAN MR ROSCOE MY SOLICITOR HAS THIS MORNING BROUGHT ME NEWS THAT I AM NOT LORD ARDEN LOUD MURMURS OF DISSATISFACTION FROM THE CROWD
FROM A WINDOW TO HIS RIGHT A LADY LEANED PALE WITH TERROR AND WITH HER WERE EDRED AND ELFRIDA--HE COULD JUST SEE THEIR WHITE FACES
POOR DICKIE
THE POLICE WERE TO BE SET ON THE TRACK OF BEALE THE MAN WHOM HE CALLED FATHER
FIRE AWAY HE SAID AND DICKIE FIRED AWAY
I AIN'T HAD A BARF SINCE GRAVESEND SAID DICKIE AND FLUSHED AT THE INDISCRETION
THEY MADE A SLEEPY MUSIC
I WISH I HAD TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE WEDDING
FOR BEALE'S SAKE HE HAD GIVEN UP THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE FOR THE SORDID LIFE
AND HE WHO GAVE UP HIS LIFE HERE FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE HE LOVED WILL LIVE AS LONG AS LIFE SHALL BEAT IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO LOVED HIM
I USED TO BE
DRY UP
THEY WERE EXCELLENT FOR MAKING PATTERNS WITH
AS THEY DREW NEARER AND LOOKED DOWN AT ARDEN CASTLE DICKIE SAW TWO LITTLE FIGURES IN ITS GREEN COURTYARD AND WONDERED WHETHER THEY COULD POSSIBLY BE EDRED AND ELFRIDA THE LITTLE COUSINS WHOM HE HAD MET IN KING JAMES THE FIRST'S TIME AND WHO THE NURSE SAID REALLY BELONGED TO THE TIMES OF KING EDWARD THE SEVENTH OR NOWADAYS JUST AS HE DID HIMSELF
FIVE COLD RISSOLES A LOT OF BREAD AND BUTTER TWO SLICES OF CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF MILK
WHAT WAS THE USE OF TELLING BEALE THAT HE HAD COME BACK OUT OF THE DREAM JUST FOR HIS SAKE
THEY BOUGHT A RUSTY OLD BEDSTEAD VERY BIG WITH LATHS THAT HUNG LOOSE LIKE A HAMMOCK AND ALL ITS KNOBS GONE AND ONLY BARE SCREWS STICKING UP SPIKILY
I SAY THERE IS NO ONE I'D RATHER SEE THAN MY FATHER BUT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY MORE TO SAY AND BESIDES HE HAD A HAUNTING IDEA THAT THE FIRST TWO LINES--WHICH WERE QUITE THE BEST--WERE NOT HIS OWN MAKE-UP
SWELP ME I CAN'T DO IT WHISPERED BEALE
IT'S THEM BLOOMIN TALBOTS PUT ALL THIS ROT INTO YOUR HEAD THE TALBOTS SAID DICKIE
BUT AS THE PRESENT LORD ARDEN WAS AN HONEST MAN AND ONLY TOO ANXIOUS THAT DICKIE SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO HIM EVEN THE LAWYERS HAD TO CUT THEIR WORK SHORT
IT WAS EXACTLY AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE IN A DREAM
QUITE A HOLE MR BEALE DUG BEFORE THE TALL STALK SLOPED AND FELL WITH SLOW DIGNITY LIKE A FOREST TREE BEFORE THE AXE
IT'S ALL UP WITH YOU AND ME AND AMELIA AND THE DOGS AND THE LITTLE OME
A DECENT YOUNG WOMAN--AMELIA BY NAME--WAS ENGAGED TO COME IN EVERY DAY AND DO FOR THEM
IT'S JOLLY SHARP WHAT SORT O WOOD BEALE ASKED
IT WAS DRY AND HARD--THREE OR FOUR LITTLE DRY THINGS FELL FROM ABOVE AND RATTLED ON HIS HEAD
FATHER I AM SO HAPPY HE SAID AND BURROWED HIS NOSE IN A VELVET DOUBLET AND PERHAPS SNIVELLED A LITTLE
AS SHE DID SO SHE KISSED HIM
LITTLE SURPRISE FOR IM EH
AND THY MOTHER--SHE ALSO HATH A GIFT FOR THEE--FROM THY GRANDFATHER
I GIVE YOU MY WORD DICKIE WAS FULL OF QUESTIONS BUT MR BEALE HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THEM
MAKE A GOOD BREW GOODY MAKE A GOOD BREW--AMBER AND NITRE AND WORMWOOD--VINEGAR AND QUINCES AND MYRRH--WITH WORMWOOD CAMPHOR AND THE FRESH FLOWERS OF THE CAMOMILE
BUT IF ANY ONE SAW THOSE SOVEREIGNS DUG UP THOSE SOVEREIGNS WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM
ILLUSTRATION WITH SIXTEEN FULL-PAGE ILLUSTRATIONS BY H
HE CRAWLED ACROSS TO WHERE THE CRUTCH LAY--THE OLD BROOM CUT DOWN THAT LADY TALBOT HAD COVERED WITH BLACK VELVET FOR HIM
WELL SAID DICKIE THEY WAS GIVE ME--SEE WE'LL NEVER CHANGE EM THOUGH SAID BEALE DESPONDENTLY
HE HAS INDEED A ART OF GOLD THAT WAS HOW DICKIE TALKED TO HIS FRIEND TINKLER
THIS IS WHERE WE DISEMBARK SAID THE LITTLE GIRL COUSIN
CHAPTER XI LORD ARDEN THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK AND A LOT OF LETTER-WRITING BEFORE ANY ONE SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO BE SURE WHO WAS LORD ARDEN
THEN GO WHERE THE DOG GOES
WHEN THE MAN WAS SEARCHED THE LETTER WAS FOUND ON HIM WHICH THE MAN--IT WAS THAT REDHEADED MAN YOU HAVE HEARD OF--HAD TAKEN FROM TALBOT COURT
THE LITTLE SHIRT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT HELPED AND THAT ONLY GAVE HIM THE DESPERATE COURAGE TO BEAT ON THE PANELS AND SHOUT NURSE
COME LOVE I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING SHE TOOK HIM DOWN INTO A WARM CURTAINED ROOM BLEW TO FLAME THE GRAY ASHES ON THE OPEN HEARTH GAVE HIM ELDER WINE TO DRINK HOT AND SPICED AND KNEELING BEFORE HIM RUBBING HIS COLD BARE FEET SHE TOLD HIM
HOW IN THUNDER CAN I GET ON WITH MY DIGGING WITH YOU OWLIN YER EAD OFF INQUIRED THE MAN NEXT DOOR
THE BODY NOT YET RECOVERED IT NEVER WAS RECOVERED OF COURSE
NONSENSE BOXES DID NOT HAVE BEDS IN THEM AND WINDOWS
THAT'S THE PRETTIEST OF THE LOT SAID DICKIE HARDING ALONE IN THE EMPTY HOUSE
THEN ALL IN A MOMENT EVERYTHING GREW CONFUSED
WHEN DID YOU MAKE ALL THAT UP I DREAMED IT I TELL YOU SAID DICKIE
A BOX WITH A LID THAT FITS
HE SAT UP IN BED AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT HE WAS NOT NEARLY SO TIRED AS HE THOUGHT
MR BEALE CARRIED DICKIE ON HIS BACK FOR WHAT SEEMED A VERY LONG WAY ALONG DARK ROADS UNDER DARK TREES AND OVER DARK MEADOWS
IT IS REALLY WITH THE GOING OF THAT RABBIT-HUTCH THAT THIS STORY BEGINS
AS HE WILLS
DICKIE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY TO RIGHT AND LEFT IN FRONT AND BEHIND
SHE DREW OUT OF THE DARKNESS WITHIN A DULL-COLORED LEATHER BAG EMBROIDERED IN GOLD THREAD AND CRIMSON SILK
I DUNNO SHALL I GO UP BY MYSELF TO WHERE HE LIVES AND SEE IF HE'S ALL RIGHT NOT MUCH SAID MR BEALE
I CAN HEAR YOU POUNDING ABOUT UP THERE
WE DON'T REALLY BELONG HERE AT ALL
THAT'S WHAT IT'LL COME TO I KNOW DON'T YOU PUT YOURSELF ABOUT SAID DICKIE CALMLY
WHY THERE'S NOTHING TO DO EXCEPT TO ENJOY YOURSELF AND LEARN YOUR LESSONS AND BE HAPPY SHE TOLD HIM
R.D
R.D
WHY IT ISN'T YOUR OWN POETRY AT ALL
THE BLAZON
IT WAS A SLOW AND NERVOUS BUSINESS
WANTED YOU TO BEALE ANSWERED HOLDING HIM CLOSE AND LOOKING AT HIM AS MEN LOOK AT SOME RARE TREASURE GAINED WITH MUCH COST AND AFTER LONG SEEKING
THIS COMES FROM THE TIMES WE BELONG TO RICHARD KNEW IT WELL
MR BEALE WENT MORE AND MORE SLOWLY AND AS THE LADY AND THE LITTLE GIRL DREW NEAR HE STOPPED ALTOGETHER AND TOUCHED HIS CAP
A KINDNESS IS NEVER WASTED SO THEY SAY THAT AIN'T NOTHING SAID BEALE
LORD ARDEN DROWNED
THE TEACHER AT HIS SCHOOL HAD GIVEN HIM SIX--"CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST QUENTIN DURWARD HEREWARD THE WAKE AND THREE OTHERS--ALL PAPER-BACKED
WELL SAID MR BEALE IF THERE AIN'T MONEY IN THAT BEAST
MY SON JAMES HERE TELLS ME YOU'VE BEEN'S GOOD AS A SON TO HIM I'D LOVE IT SAID DICKIE
HE LIVES IN LONDON
HE REACHED IT JUST AS THE LEADER OF THE ATTACKING PARTY HAD HEWN HIS WAY THROUGH THE ARDEN MEN AND TAKEN HIS FIRST STEP ON THE FLAGGED PATH OF THE COURTYARD
IT HURT BUT DICKIE LIKED IT
IT WAS VERY STILL
I CAN'T AND I WON'T I SHAN'T BE REALLY DEAD SILLY RICHARD TOLD HER
BUT IF HE SEEMED TO BE DEAD EDRED AND ELFRIDA WOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY
I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW THAT MOST CHILDREN CAN SPEAK AT LEAST TWO LANGUAGES EVEN IF THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A FOREIGN NURSE OR BEEN TO FOREIGN CLIMES--OR WHETHER YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY CHILD WHO CAN DO THIS
SHE WAS SELLING RIBBONS AND COTTONS AND NEEDLES FROM DOOR TO DOOR AND MADE A POOR THING OF IT SHE TOLD THEM
SOME BLOKES DON'T BUT I DO DICKIE FELT THAT THIS WAS TRUE
AND WHAT IS MORE IT WORKED
THE STUBBLY FIELDS WHERE BARLEY STOOD IN SHEAVES--REAL BARLEY LIKE THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR BUT THREE GAVE TO THEIR HENS
HE STOPPED A BIG BURLY FELLOW IN A LEATHERN COAT AND STEEL ROUND CAP AND LOOKED BEWILDERED AT THE LITTLE FIGURE COMING AT HIM WITH ALL THE FIRE AND COURAGE OF THE ARDENS BURNING IN HIS BLUE EYES
NOW HOLD THE WOOD SO AND THE KNIFE THUS THEN EVERY DAY DICKIE WENT DOWN TO THE DOCKYARD WHEN LESSONS WERE DONE
THERE WERE WOODEN BOXES IN THE VAN A LOT OF THEM AND ON THE CANVAS OF THE TILT WAS PAINTED IN FAT WHITE LETTERS +----------------+ | FRY'S TONIC | | | | THE ONLY CURE | +----------------+ THERE WOULD BE ROOM ON THE TOP OF THE BOXES--THEY DID NOT REACH WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE TILT
ONE OF THE BEST THE TWO MEN WENT QUICKLY TOWARDS THE GATE
AND THAT FATHER'S RICHES WOULD BE HIS ONE DAY TO DEAL WITH FOR THE GOOD OF THE MEN UNDER HIM FOR THEIR HAPPINESS AND THE GLORY OF GOD
TO LET DICKIE STOPPED
BUT IF THE NIPPER SAYS SO IT IS SO
SHE WORE A QUEER WHITE CAP THE LIKE OF WHICH DICKIE HAD NEVER SEEN AND ROUND HER NECK WAS A RUFF WHICH REMINDED HIM OF THE CUT-PAPER FRILLS IN THE HAM AND BEEF SHOPS IN THE NEW CROSS ROAD
IT WAS ACTING YOU SEE AND ALL CHILDREN LOVE ACTING
SO THAT NEITHER ELFRIDA NOR ANY OF THE GREAT COMPANY IN THE WHITE HALL COULD HEAR A WORD ONLY EDRED ALONE
BE OFF WITH YOU
HE HAS FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING SAID THE NURSE QUICKLY
YOU DONE RIGHT
WHAT I SAY IS DON'T LET'S THIS COLD WATER DAMPED THE SPIRIT OF THE OTHERS ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES
I'LL GET A SPADE AND AVE A TURN AT IT THIS VERY DAY SO I WILL
OH DICKIE DON'T THE OTHER CHILDREN CRIED OUT TOGETHER
HE SLID FROM THE HIGH BED
YOU MUST LISTEN CAREFULLY
AND I DON'T LIKE IT THAT WAS WHAT HE FELT AT FIRST
NOW SAID THE MAN YOU TAKE AN WRITE--MAKE IT FLAT AGIN THE SOLE OF ME BOOT HE LAY FACE DOWNWARD ON THE ROAD AND TURNED UP HIS BOOT AS THOUGH BOOTS WERE THE MOST NATURAL WRITING-DESKS IN THE WORLD
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT
HE LOVED THE OTHER LIFE SO MUCH THAT HE FEARED THAT ONCE AGAIN THERE HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO RETURN TO MR BEALE AND DEPTFORD AND THE FEEL OF DIRTY CLOTHES AND THE SMELL OF DUST-BINS
HE GOT UP IN THE DIRTY COMFORTLESS ROOM AND DRESSED HIMSELF
ONLY THE NAIL HAD SLIPPED ONCE OR TWICE WHILE HE WAS DOING THE 9 SO THAT IT LOOKED MUCH MORE LIKE A FIVE--15
BUT HE HAD WAKENED TO THE SAME DREAM ONCE MORE AND NOW HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE REALLY BELONGED HERE AND WHETHER THIS WERE THE REAL LIFE AND THE OTHER--THE OLD SORDID DIRTY NEW CROSS LIFE--MERELY A HORRID DREAM THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS FEVER
DICKIE HELD THE MUG AND THE SOAP
THAT I WILL SAID BEALE READILY
YOU AN YOUR GRAND FRIENDS
SEE AN IF I DON'T GET PINCHED THEN YOU JUST OPENS THE DOOR AND ME AND THAT REDHEADED BLOKE WE COMES IN WHAT FOR ASKED DICKIE
BEFORE LONG TWO MOST MISERABLE CHILDREN FACED EACH OTHER IN EDRED'S BEDROOM DRESSED AS RED INDIANS SO FAR AS THEIR HEADS AND BACKS WENT
IF DICKIE HAD BEEN BEALE HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE THE SPEECH BEGINNING FATHER IT IS I BUT AS HE WAS ONLY DICKIE HE SAID YOUR NAME'S BEALE AIN'T IT IT MIGHT BE OLD BEALE ALLOWED
DICKIE WENT HOME--HIS AUNT WAS STILL OUT
NOBODY WEREN'T NEVER KINDER TO ME NOR WHAT LORD ARDEN WAS AN LADY TALBOT TOO--WITHOUT IT WAS YOU FARVER AH SAID BEALE TO THE OLD MAN E KNOWS HOW TO GET ROUND HIS OLD FATHER DON'T E WHAT DOES HE WANT TO TALK THAT WAY FOR THE OLD MAN ASKED
IT'S ALL VERY SMART HE SAID BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FEEL THE FIDGETS IN YOUR LEGS
HOWEVER SHE NOW LOOKED UP TO HIM IN ALL THINGS AND CONSULTED HIM ABOUT EVERYTHING AND AFTER ALL THIS IS VERY PLEASANT FROM YOUR SISTER ESPECIALLY WHEN EVERY ONE HAS BEEN RATHER IN THE HABIT OF SUGGESTING THAT SHE IS BETTER THAN YOU ARE AS WELL AS CLEVERER
TELL ME ALL ABOUT MYSELF WILL YOU NURSE I THOUGHT AS MUCH SHE MUTTERED AND THEN BEGAN TO TELL HIM WONDERFUL THINGS
FOR DICKIE THOUGHT OF THEM JUST AS SOVEREIGNS--AND SO THEY WERE
AND DICKIE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HE WAS ON HER LAP
HE MADE WITH TRIPLE LINES OF SILVERY SEEDS A SIX-POINTED STAR PAGE 81 THE HOUSE WAS QUITE DARK NOW BUT A STREET LAMP THREW ITS LIGHT INTO THE FRONT ROOM BARE EMPTY AND DUSTY
I DO HATE THIS HORRID SAMPLER AND AS SHE SAID IT DICKIE HAD A MOST ODD FEELING RATHER AS IF A CLOCK HAD STRUCK OR HAD STOPPED STRIKING--A FEELING OF SUDDEN CHANGE
THEY'D ONLY GO TO WASTE IF E WASN'T TO SELL EM
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE WHITE FACE OF A GREAT HOUSE SHOWED ONLY A LITTLE PALER THAN THE TREES ABOUT IT
YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE AIN'T YE NO I NEVER SAID DICKIE
AND I KNOW THAT'S NO USE I SHOULD THINK NOT SAID EDRED
SHE DIDN'T CARE WHAT ITS PRICE WAS BLESS YOU
IT WAS LONG PAST HIS PROPER BEDTIME AND THE EXERTION OF BEING SO EXTRA CLEVER HAD BEEN VERY TIRING
THE SPOT HE HAD CHOSEN WAS UNDER A CLUMP OF FURZE BIGGER THAN ANY THEY HAD PASSED
THAT WON'T FRIGHTEN YOU WILL IT NO SAID DICKIE
BUT IN THE SPRING--WHEN THE WEATHER GETS A BIT OPEN--WHAT D'YOU SAY TO SHUTTING UP THE LITTLE OUSE AND TAKING THE ROAD FOR A BIT
COME PLAY BALL IN THE GARDEN HIS COUSIN LOOKED UP FROM HER SAMPLER SET THE FRAME DOWN AND JUMPED UP
I LED THEM INTO THIS--HELP ME TO GET THEM BACK SAFE
THE SENSE OF ROMANCE OF GREAT THINGS ALL ABOUT THEM TRANSCENDING THE ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE--THIS IN THE JEWS HAS SURVIVED CENTURIES OF TORMENT SHAME CRUELTY AND OPPRESSION
DON'T SNIVEL LIKE THAT FOR GOODNESS SAKE ELFRIDA
HE WOULD ONLY BE FOUND BY THE REBELS AND BE LOCKED AWAY MORE SECURELY
WE'VE FOUND A BRICKED-UP PLACE AND THERE'S A DOOR BEHIND AND I'M ALMOST SURE IT'S WHERE THEY HID THE TREASURE WHEN CROMWELL'S WICKED MEN TOOK THE CASTLE THERE IS A LEGEND TO THAT EFFECT SAID ELFRIDA'S FATHER TO THE LAWYER WHO WAS LOOKING INTERESTED
THEN YOU WON'T MIND SO MUCH OF A DAYTIME BUT I MIND MORE SAID DICKIE SNIFFING HARD
THERE AIN'T NOBODY HERE TO PAY WHAT THAT LITTLE HOBJEC'S WORTH
LET ME STAY HERE AND SEE MY MOTHER AND MY LITTLE BROTHER AND SHALT MY LAMB--AND SHALT THE NURSE SAID
DICKIE PUT OUT HIS RUSHLIGHT AND STAYED QUIET FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT PRESENTLY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY QUIET ANOTHER MOMENT SO VERY SOFTLY AND CAREFULLY HE CREPT OUT AND HID BEHIND A TALL PRESS AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE
YOU KNOW OW TO STICK IT ON IF YOU'RE PINCHED
AND HE HEARD AS HIS KNEE TOUCHED THE ICY WINDOW-SILL THE STRANGE VOICE SAY ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS IN THE AIR FALLING FALLING
INSTEAD SHE SAID OH HOW RIPPING IT IS TO REALLY AND TRULY FIND YOU HERE
HAND OVER THE FLOWERS
HE WAS AFRAID OF SAYING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT--IT FELT STUFFY--AS IF SOMETHING WAS GOING TO BURST THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THE COUSINS YOU KNEW AT DEPTFORD BUT WHERE HAVE THE REAL COUSINS I KNEW AT DEPTFORD BEEN THEN--ALL THIS TIME--WHILE THOSE OTHER KIDS WERE HERE PRETENDING TO BE THEM DICKIE ASKED
WE NEVER FORGET WE HE STOPPED
AND I'M CHILD ENOUGH HE SAID BEFORE HE WENT AS WELL AS CAUTIOUS ENOUGH TO BEG YOU NOT TO BRING ANY OF IT OUT TILL I COME BACK AND NOT TO LEAVE GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TILL THE POLICE ARE HERE SO WHEN THE TREASURE AT LAST SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY IT SAW IT UNDER THE EYES OF POLICEMEN AND BANK MANAGERS AND ALL THE SERVANTS AND ALL THE FAMILY AND THE BEALES AND TRUE AND HALF THE VILLAGE BESIDE WHO HAD GOT WIND OF THE STRANGE HAPPENINGS AT THE CASTLE AND HAD CROWDED IN THROUGH THE NOW UNDEFENDED GATE
YOU SHAN'T--NO AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LIGHT THAT MADE ONE WINK AND BLINK
THE NEXT THING THAT DICKIE REMEMBERS IS BEING IN A ROOM THAT SEEMED FULL OF PEOPLE AND LIGHTS AND WONDERFUL FURNITURE WITH SOME ONE HOLDING A GLASS TO HIS LIPS A LITTLE GLASS THAT SMELLED OF PUBLIC-HOUSES VERY NASTY
HE SAT UP AND LISTENED
EVERY ONE WAS PRENTICED TO A TRADE
AND OH DICKIE SAID ELFRIDA WITH DEEP CONCERN YOU WON'T EVER SEE US AGAIN EITHER
AND FROM THEM HE LEARNED MORE NEW WORDS
WHY OF COURSE--THE MOONFLOWERS
AT LAST HE COULD LIE STILL NO LONGER
AND THE THOUGHT SWELLED HIS HEART AND IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS BORN TO A GREAT DESTINY
YOU'VE GOT A TRADE MY SON THAT'S SURE
OF COURSE YOU FEEL THAT
THE BLUE SKY SHOWED THROUGH THE ARCHWAY WHERE THE TALL GATES HAD BEEN AND UNDER THE ARCH WAS A MASS OF MEN SHOUTING SCREAMING STRUGGLING AND THE GLEAM OF STEEL AND THE SCARLET OF BRAVE BLOOD
SO WHEN DICKIE HAD WAITED A LITTLE WHILE HE BEGAN TO THINK AS ONE ALWAYS DOES WHEN PEOPLE DON'T KEEP THEIR APPOINTMENTS THAT PERHAPS HE HAD MISTAKEN THE TIME OR THAT THE CLOCK AT THE COTTAGE WAS SLOW
DICKIE WAS MUCH TOO FULL OF HIS OWN QUESTIONINGS TO ANSWER THEIRS
LIE DOWN SIR HE SAID AND THE DOG PAUSED THOUGH THE CHAIN WAS STILL STRAINED TIGHT
THAT AFTERNOON BEALE SMOKING IN THE GARDEN GOT UP AS HE OFTEN DID TO LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DOGS
AND THE GENT E TIPPED ME A THICK UN AND I SPOTTED THE PUPS A MONTH AGO AND I KNEW I COULD HAVE EM FOR FIVE BOB SO I GOT EM
AND YET ANOTHER LANGUAGE--SPOKEN WITH THE REAL ACCENT TOO--IN WHICH HE CONVERSES WITH THE BOOT-BOY AND THE GROOMS
IT WAS AS THE ARDENS WALKED HOME OVER THE SHORT TURF THAT LORD ARDEN SAID TO HIS SISTER I WISH ALL THE COTTAGES ABOUT HERE WERE LIKE BEALE'S
AIN'T THEY FINE
SEEMS A PITY TO SEPARATE EM SOMEHOW
WE WERE ALWAYS BEING CHASED OR PUT IN PRISON OR BOTHERED SOMEHOW OR OTHER
BECAUSE IF I WERE LONGER THERE THAN I AM HERE I SHOULD NOT BE GROWING UP SO FAST HERE AS I SHOULD THERE
AND AS THE SWAN LAID ITS LONG NECK LOW IN DOWNWARD FLIGHT HE SAW HIS COUSINS IN A CARRIAGE LIKE HIS OWN RISE INTO THE SKY AND SAIL AWAY TOWARDS THE SOUTH
HIS FEET SEEMED NOT ONLY TO BE STRONG AND ACTIVE BUT CLEVER ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT
THE MORNING SUN WOKE HIM
BUT PRESENTLY GATHERED ITSELF TOGETHER AND BEGAN TO CREEP DOWN THE HILL WINDING IN AND OUT AMONG THE HILLOCKS IN AN EVER-DEEPENING STREAM
THERE WAS A TALL THIN RAGGED MAN LOUNGING AGAINST A STABLE DOOR IN THE YARD WHERE THE PUNCH AND JUDY SHOW LIVED
BUT HE KNEW THAT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT--OR EVEN BELIEVE IT
AND NOW HE MADE A RESOLUTION--THAT HE WOULD NOT SET OUT THE CHARM OF TINKLER AND SEAL AND MOON-SEEDS UNTIL HE HAD ESTABLISHED MR BEALE IN AN HONORABLE CALLING AND MADE A LIFE FOR HIM IN WHICH HE COULD BE HAPPY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BECOME OF THE REAL ELFRIDA AND EDRED WHO BELONG TO THIS TIME
THERE IS A LITTLE YARD AT THE BACK OF EACH HOUSE
HE TURNED TO GO HOME WHEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT BROUGHT THE BLOOD TO HIS FACE
AND NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO OUR TIMES--QUEEN ALEXANDRA YOU KNOW AND KING EDWARD THE SEVENTH AND ELECTRIC LIGHT AND MOTORS AND 1908
TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE THE TALE OF HEREWARD THE WAKE LASTED TILL THE JOLTING PERAMBULATOR CAME TO ANCHOR IN A HOLLOW PLACE AMONG THICK FURZE BUSHES
AN THE LADY IN HER WHITE SHE LOOKS AT THE PATH AND THE GENT E LOOKS AT ER WHITE BOOTS--AN I OFF'S WITH ME COAT LIKE THAT THERE RALLY GENT YOU YARNED ME ABOUT AND FLOPS IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PUDDLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GAL
IT IS BUT A TALE SHE TOLD
STAND CLOSE TOGETHER AND I'LL SPREAD OUT THE MOON-SEEDS SO DICKIE SAID AND THEY STOOD AND HE SPREAD THE MOON-SEEDS OUT AND HE WISHED TO BE WITH THE PARTY OF MEN WHO WERE HIDING THE TREASURE
THIS ERE OLD ARTICHOOK'S GOT SOME ROOTS I LAY THE DIGGING BEGAN AT THE FENCE AND REACHED THE MOONFLOWER WHOSE ROOTS WERE INDEED DEEP
SO THEY TOOK THE HURT FOOT TO THE HOSPITAL AND OF COURSE HE HAD TO GO WITH IT AND THE HOSPITAL WAS MUCH MORE LIKE THE HEAVEN HE READ OF IN HIS BOOKS THAN ANYTHING HE HAD EVER COME ACROSS BEFORE
ALSO HIS DINNER WAS OF BREAD AND WATER AND HE HAD TO WRITE OUT TWO HUNDRED TIMES I AM A BAD BOY AND I ASK THE PARDON OF MY GOOD TUTOR
AND INSTANTLY THEY WERE
HE KNEW THERE WERE TWO BROMPTONS AND TWO RICHMONDS ONE IN YORKSHIRE THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THINGS HAPPENED AT THIS PLACE THAT REMINDED HIM OF THAT NICE LADY TALBOT WHO HAD WANTED HIM TO STAY AND BE HER LITTLE BOY
I KNOW BOYS DON'T BUT IN THE TIMES I'M GOING TO MEN KISS EACH OTHER
AT LEAST THE ADDRESS WAS NEW CROSS BUT REALLY THE HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED WAS ONE OF A ROW OF HORRID LITTLE HOUSES BUILT ON THE SLOPE WHERE ONCE GREEN FIELDS RAN DOWN THE HILL TO THE RIVER AND THE OLD HOUSES OF THE DEPTFORD MERCHANTS STOOD STATELY IN THEIR PLEASANT GARDENS AND FRUITFUL ORCHARDS
HE'LL GO
ATH YOU LIKE SAID MR ROSENBERG ONLY YOU MUTHN'T LET HIM INTERFERE WITH BITHNETH
THE POETRY HE DECIDED WOULD HAVE BEEN NICER IF IT HAD BEEN MORE ABOUT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND LESS ABOUT FAME AND TREES AND BURDENS
BUT SHE WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SHE HAS DONE IT SAID THE MOULDIESTWARP GRAVELY
WELL BUT HOW AM I TO GET AWAY--WITH MY CRUTCH MEAN TO SAY YOU'D CUT AND RUN IF YOU WAS THE SAME AS ME--ABOUT THE LEGS I MEAN YES SAID DICKIE
SO I WENT ALONG OF IM AN THEN IN THE WOOD E SAID E'D GIVE ME A DRESSING DOWN IF I DIDN'T GET THROUGH THE WINDER AND OPEN THE DOOR
BECAUSE HIS PACES ARE SO EASY DICKIE EXPLAINED
DICKIE THOUGHT HIM VERY CLEVER
DICKIE AND THE NURSE SAT MOST OF THE NIGHT TALKING BY THE REPLENISHED FIRE FOR THE TALE SEEMED ENDLESS
DICKIE HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS
HIS EYES TURNING SWIFTLY HERE AND THERE SHOWED HIM THAT HE WAS IN A SHOP--A SHOP FULL OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT
PERHAPS THERE WERE TWO DEPTFORDS
MR BEALE'S EYES ALWAYS RATHER PROMINENT ALMOST RESEMBLED THE EYES OF THE LOBSTER OR THE SNAIL AS THEIR GAZE FELL ON THE EMBROIDERED LEATHER BAG
WELL I SCRATCHED IT ANYWAY SAID DICKIE
THE PERSON TO BE REALLY SURPRISED WAS MR BEALE
I PROMISED TO GO
DICKIE TURNED A LITTLE PALER AND SAID WHY POLICE
OH DON'T CALL NAMES SAID THE MAN
HE IS VERY GREAT
AND DICKIE FOUND HE HAD A BIT OF PAPER IN HIS DOUBLET ON WHICH TO WRITE IT
AND OUR FORTUNE'S MADE
BUT IT AIN'T ALL RIGHT BEALE INSISTED STUBBORNLY
LAURIE GROVE NEW CROSS EDRED TOLD HIM
AND HIS PATTER--ENOUGH TO MAKE A CAT LAUGH E IS SOMETIMES
A VERY FAT WOMAN ASKED DICKIE TO TOAST A HERRING FOR HER ON A BIT OF WOOD
WHY NOT
BEALE NOTICED IT
HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE IN A JUG OF WATER TILL I GO HOME PAGE 16 A PALE YOUNG MAN IN SPECTACLES APPEARED FROM A SORT OF DARK CAVE AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP TOOK FLOWERS AND TICKET AND WAS SWALLOWED UP AGAIN IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE
YET WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE
WE'RE ALL RIGHT AS WE ARE I THINK
AND ALL THE TIME THEY WERE TALKING LORD ARDEN'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS FACE EXCEPT WHEN THEY WANDERED TO TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL
I THOUGHT YOU'D KNOW
I'LL SET IT ALONG THIS END SOON'S I'VE GOT IT TURNED OVER
AFTER DINNER THE MEN SAT IN THE SUN AND SMOKED AND DICKIE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN TEACHING THE SPANIEL AND TRUE THAT NEITHER OF THEM WAS A DOG WHO DESERVED TO BE GROWLED AT
I FELL ASLEEP THE GIRLS CROWDED ROUND HIM WITH QUESTIONS AND CARESSES
I WISH HE SAID SLOWLY OH DEAR MOULDIWARPS OF ARDEN GRANT ME THESE LAST WISHES
AN I NEEDN'T A-GONE IF I ADN'T WANTED TO HE'S FEVERISH SAID THE LADY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING
AND BEHOLD THEY WERE NO LONGER STRANGERS
THEY WERE DEAR GIRLS AND THEY WERE VERY NICE TO DICKIE
I ALWAYS HOPED WE SHOULD SOME DAY
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE THE TEA TASTED QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT DOES ANYWHERE ELSE
YOU SEE I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM AFRAID SHE SAID LAYING AWAY THE FOLDED CLOTH AND TAKING OUT ANOTHER FROM THE DEEP PRESS OAKEN WITH SMOOTH-WORN BROWN IRON HINGES AND LOCK
BUT HE WOULD NOT
AND WHEN THEY MADE THEIR EVENING CAMP IN A DEEP GULLY SOFT WITH BEECH-LEAVES AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE RIDGE--CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE OF KEEPERS--AT THE SMOOTHNESS OF A MIGHTY SLOPE GREEN-GRAY IN THE DUSK WHERE RABBITS FRISKED AND PLAYED HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO HIS TIREDNESS AND STOPPED TO REST THE NIGHT ANYWHERE ELSE
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE
I COULD NEVER BE HAPPY HERE--NEVER HE WENT ON
IF IT'S REAL--REAL WITH MAGIC IN IT--YOU'VE GOT TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO ME--EVERY BIT
DICKIE PRESSED UP THE GRASS TO COVER THE MARKS HE HAD MADE ON THE STONE SO LOW AS TO BE ALMOST UNDERGROUND AND QUITE HIDDEN BY THE GRASS ROOTS
OH THE JOLLY LITTLE BEASTS SAID DICKIE
TIP-TOPPER--SIR EDWARD TALBOT THAT'S IM--'E'S IN FURRIN PARTS FOR IS EALTH E IS
ONLY OF COURSE HE DID NOT TELL ABOUT THE MAGIC OR SAY THAT IN THAT MAGIC WORLD HE AND LORD ARDEN'S CHILDREN WERE FRIENDS AND COUSINS
I LIKE YOU NEXTER MY OWN DADDY AND MR BAXTER NEXT DOOR THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID MR BEALE AWKWARDLY
DICKIE 304 HARDING'S LUCK HARDING'S LUCK CHAPTER I TINKLER AND THE MOONFLOWER DICKIE LIVED AT NEW CROSS
YOU WANTED ME TO DIDN'T YOU HE ADDED
THAT CHINK WOT YOU LENT ME TO GET TO GRAVESEND WITH HE PAUSED AND ADDED IN HIS OTHER VOICE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU SIR I'M NOT GOING TO LEND YOU ANY MORE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE AFTER SAID THE JEW WHO HAD ALREADY REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR HIS CONFIDING GENEROSITY
THERE WAS A PAUSE
D'YE THINK I'M GOING TO PUT UP WITH BEING BULLIED AND DRUV BY A LITTLE NIPPER LIKE AS I COULD LAY OUT WITH ONE AND AS EASY AS WHAT I COULD ONE OF THEM PUPS HE MOVED HIS FOOT AMONG THE SOFT STRONG LITTLE THINGS THAT WERE UTTERING BABY-GROWLS AND BITING AT HIS BROKEN BOOT WITH THEIR LITTLE WHITE TEETH
I'D GO OUT AND SEE THE WORLD A BIT I WOULD WHAT--ME SAID DICKIE
THEY HAD TAKEN THE CLOAK FROM HIS EYES NOW AND HE SAW PRESENTLY THAT THEY WERE NEARING A COSTER'S BARROW
MY WORD
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN THEY ASK YOU WHERE I AM SAY I AM IN THE CAVE
PRESENTLY I SAY FARVER I'M SORRY I ACTED SO SILLY
NOT MUCH BE'IND IT IF YOU ASK ME
BUT THE DOG-CART WAS A LITTLE LATE BECAUSE THE PONY HAD DROPPED A SHOE AND HAD HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE BLACKSMITH'S
I'LL DOSS HERE HE SAID
WELL SMELL TO IT THEN
CHAPTER VIII GOING HOME IN DEPTFORD THE SEVEN MONTHS HAD ALMOST GONE BY
SAME OLE DAWG SAID BEALE WITH PRIDE
HE HAD THAT FEELING YOU SOMETIMES HAVE ABOUT GROWN-UP PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY DO UNDERSTAND AND ARE TO BE TRUSTED
IF THE FATHER OF EDRED AND ELFRIDA HAD WANTED TO DISPUTE ABOUT IT NO DOUBT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH WORK TO KEEP THE LAWYERS BUSY FOR YEARS AND SEAS OF INK WOULD HAVE BEEN SPILLED AND THUNDERS OF ELOQUENCE SPENT ON THE QUESTION
THEY FELT THAT HE HAD INDEED TO DO IT
YOU DO FORGIVE ME DON'T YOU FATHER OH
EDRED RUBBED HIS LEGS WHILE DICKIE STRETCHED HIS FINGERS TO GET THE PINS AND NEEDLES OUT OF HIS ARMS
PUFFS OF SWEET STRONG SPICY STEAM ROSE OUT OF IT AS THEY JERKED IT THIS WAY AND THAT
WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AGES
NO MY MIND'S MADE UP IT WAS AND THEY COULD NOT SHAKE IT
IT AIN'T NO USE TRYING TO DECEIVE THE NIPPER--THAT SHARP HE IS SAID BEALE WITH A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND CONFUSION
HE WAS SUNK DOWNILY AMONG PILLOWS AND OVER HIM LAY A DOWN QUILT COVERED WITH BLUE-FLOWERED SATIN
82 V
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AIN'T IT
E'LL THINK YOU'RE A MAN IN REG'LAR WORK BY YOUR BEING UP SO EARLY P'RAPS SAID BEALE THOUGHTFULLY RUNNING HIS HAND OVER THE RUSTLING STUBBLE OF HIS TWO DAYS BEARD--"P'RAPS I'D BEST GET A WASH AND BRUSH-UP FIRST EH
DICKIE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEN WHY HE SUDDENLY FELT AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO CHOKE
OUR SON COMES TO CLAIM THE GUERDON OF LEARNING THE FATHER SAID
AND FOR A FINAL ENJOYMENT HE LAID OUT HIS TREASURES ON THE NEWSPAPER--TINKLER AND THE SEAL IN THE MIDDLE AND THE PEARLY COUNTERS ARRANGED IN PATTERNS ROUND THEM CIRCLES AND SQUARES AND OBLONGS
LIKE THE ONES THAT HIS FANCY HAD PUT IN THE MOULDERING HUTCH AT HOME
YOU'RE ALWAYS LIABLE TO GET YOURSELF INTO TROUBLE OVER IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER--THAT'S THE WORST OF IT
SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING YOUR FATHER IS SAFE AND YOU WILL INHERIT ARDEN WHAT AM I TO DO EDRED ASKED AGAIN--"TO GET DICKIE BACK I MEAN YOU MUST GO ALONE AND AT NIGHT TO BEALE'S COTTAGE OPEN THE DOOR AND YOU WILL FIND RICHARD'S DOG ASLEEP BEFORE THE FIRE
DICKIE LEARNED THAT THE EDRED AND ELFRIDA WHO BELONGED TO HIS OWN TIMES HAD A FATHER WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD
WHERE DID YOU GET HOLD OF ME
AND BID THY TUTOR TEACH THEE A WELCOME SONG TO SAY TO THEM WHEN THEY COME IN GATHERING THE FLOWERS AND ARRANGING THEM WAS PLEASANT AND EASY
I WAS A CABINET-MAKER ONCE THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT TO LOOK AT ME
I WONDER HE SAID IF DEPTFORD WAS EVER REALLY LIKE IT WAS IN MY DREAM--THE GARDENS AND THE CLEAN RIVER AND THE FIELDS HE GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING AND WENT OFF DOWN THE STREET
DICKIE TOLD
SHE GIVE HIM A PINT TO FORGET'S WHAT I SAY WHO'S LIVIN THERE NOW DICKIE ASKED INTEREST IN HIS AUNT'S ADDRESS SWALLOWED UP IN A SUDDEN DESPERATE ANXIETY
YOU KNOW ELFRIDA EXPLAINED TO DICKIE OUR MAGIC TOOK US TO LOOK FOR TREASURE IN THE PAST
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU'D LET ME GO DOWN AND HAVE A LOOK AT IT OF COURSE SAID THE GIRL
DEAR DICKIE YOU'RE SO CLEVER DO THINK OF SOME WAY TO FIND THE TREASURE SO DICKIE THOUGHT
TO GET YOUR OWN LIVING 115 VI
AN NOT AVIN NONE OF MY OWN I SORT OF ADOPTED IM LIKE WANDERING HARES AT THE THEATRE SAID THE LANDLORD WHO HAD BEEN TOLD BY DICKIE'S AUNT THAT THE UNGRATEFUL LITTLE WARMINT HAD RUN AWAY
YOU'RE A-TAKIN ME FOR SOME OTHER CHAP THAT'S WHAT IT IS
AIN'T THERE ANY YOUNG WOMAN I COULD GIVE A TRIFLE TO TO SET YOU AND HER UP IN HOUSEKEEPING SO THEN I CASTS ABOUT AND I THINKS OF MELIA
ANYWAY IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS IS IT AND SO ON
SWANS IS DAT CONTRARY DEY WON'T GO INVISIBLE NOT FOR NO MAGIC DEY WON'T
FATHER AT GRAVESEND
WE MIGHT LET IT COME BACK TO THE MOAT SAID EDRED
ERE'S THE STEEVER YOU STICK TO THAT SAID BEALE RADIANT WITH DELIGHT
SO WHEN ON THE SECOND DAY A ROUND-FACED SMILING LADY IN A WHITE CAP SAID WELL TOMMY AND HOW ARE WE TO-DAY HE REPLIED MY NAME IS FAR FROM BEING TOMMY AND I AM IN LUX URY AND AF FLUENCE I THANK YOU GRACIOUS LADY AT WHICH THE LADY LAUGHED AND PINCHED HIS CHEEK
IT WAS SAID DICKIE SLOWLY A SORT OF JOKE
LOOK ERE MISTER HE SAID
AND THE BELT WAS NOT THERE
I WONDER HE SAID TRYING TO FEEL HIS WAY WHAT TREASON THE BALLAD DEALS WITH HE FELT IT HAD BEEN THE WRONG THING TO SAY WHEN ELFRIDA ANSWERED IN SURPRISED TONES DON'T YOU KNOW
THEY'D SAY WE PINCHED EM NO THEY WON'T
AND WHEN HE GOT TO THE KENNELS HE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR OF THE KENNELMAN'S HOUSE AND CALLED OUT WHAT HO
AND IT'S MY OWN TINKLER THAT MY DADDY GAVE ME BEFORE HE DIED AND MY AUNT MISSA PROPAGATED IT WHEN I WAS IN HOSPITAL THE MAN LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THE CARD
I SHOULD LIKE TO GO AND LOOK AT THEM CLOSER HE TOLD THE NURSE
EVERY ONE IN THE ROOM WAS LOOKING AT THE TWO CHILDREN AND IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM NOT TO ADVANCE THOUGH SLOWLY AND SHYLY RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE THRONE
I DON'T THINK AND DREW HIM IN AND SHUT THE DOOR
BUT HE COULD LEAP UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS THREE AT A TIME HE COULD RUN IN THE ARCHED ALLEYS--RUN AND JUMP AS HE HAD SEEN OTHER CHILDREN DO AND AS HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO DO HIMSELF
COME SAID THE NURSE ENCOURAGINGLY
NOW ALL IS OPEN AS THE DAY AND WE CAN PURSUE OUR CAREER AS HONORABLE MEN AND COMRADES IN ALL HIGH EMPRISE
IT'S THE FIFTH STONE FROM THE CHAPEL DOOR UNDER THE LITTLE WINDOW WITH THE ARDEN ARMS CARVED OVER IT
THERE WERE WATER-LILIES IN SHADY BACK-WATERS AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS SLOPING DOWN TO THE WATER
THEN HE SAID IT'S RUM--I LIKES TO SEE THE LITTLE BEGGAR STOKIN UP FOR ALL IT SPOILS THE MARKET
THIS WAS THE MOMENT HE HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY PREPARED FOR
AND SHE ADDED LEAST SAID IS SOONEST MENDED BUT SAID DICKIE
HE MUST WAKE UP AND KEEP HIS PROMISE TO BEALE
THAT TOO WAS LOOSE
AND IF YOU HELD IT IN YOUR HAND YOU'D LOSE IT LIKE AS NOT IN SOME OF THE YEARS YOU GO THROUGH
THE MAN LOOKED HARD AT HIM AND THEN POINTED WITH A GRIMY THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER
THE SHOCK WAS TOO GREAT AND TOO SUDDEN
IT WAS QUITE CLOSE TO THEM BEFORE EDRED LOOKED UP
IF IS LAY AIN'T A SAFE LAY OLD BEALE WON'T BE IN IT--YOU MAY LAY TO THAT DON'T LET'S SAID DICKIE EARNESTLY
EVERY ONE IN THE GALLEY STOOD UP
DIDN'T YOU PICK IM UP WITH THE DOG-CART SAME AS YOU SAID YOU WOULD NO SHOUTED LORD ARDEN
IT NOW FLOWED AWAY INTO DARKNESS
HE DREW THE LITTLE SWORD THAT HUNG AT HIS SIDE AND SHOUTING AN ARDEN
HE'LL SPOIL EVERYTHING--I KNOW E WILL JUST AS WE'RE A-GETTIN ALONG SO STRAIGHT AND GAY
PEOPLE COMES ERE WITHOUT E'ER A SHIRT TO THEIR BACKS AND MAKES FOOLS OF THEIR BETTERS
HE LAID A HAND ON THE TAIL-BOARD
BY EVENING THEY HAD SEVEN-AND-SIXPENCE
BUT IT WAS NOT ONLY THE BEAUTY OF THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THAT MADE DICKIE'S LIFE A NEW AND FULL DELIGHT
COME NOW TO THY MOTHER
THEY DID AS DICKIE HAD SAID AND FOR TWO DAYS MR BEALE WAS CONTENT TO EAT AND DOZE AND WAKE AND WATCH DICKIE'S BUSY FINGERS AND EAT AND DOZE AGAIN
I AIN'T A BABY
WILL YOU PLEASE TAKE IT TO PAY MY DEBT TO YOU AND IF IT IS WORTH MORE ACCEPT IT AS A GRATEFUL GIFT FROM ONE WHO IS STILL GRATEFULLY YOUR DEBTOR YOU'D MAKE YOUR FORTUNE ON THE HALLS SAID THE MAN AS BEALE HAD SAID
YET AT THE SAME TIME HE DID WANT TO BE
WON'T YOU OF COURSE I WILL SAID EDRED IMPATIENTLY
NOW I TELL YOU WHAT YOU GET OLD OF SOME MORE OLD SOFY LEGS AND A STONE AND A STRAP TO SHARPEN MY KNIFE WITH
I REMEMBER HIS TELLING ME ABOUT IT
STEP OUT SONNY OR WE'LL NEVER GET THERE THIS SIDE CHRISTMAS NOW YOU SEE THAT MR BEALE MAY BE A CRUEL WICKED MAN WHO ONLY WANTED TO GET HOLD OF DICKIE SO AS TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF HIM
I'LL GET YER A BIT OF MAHOGANY FROM SOMEWHERES HE SAID VERY GENTLY
CATH MR ROSENBERG WAS SAYING--"CATH DOWN ENTHURETH THPEEDY DELIVERY AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS SAYING I AM EXTREMELY SORRY SIR
HE HAD SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO GET A SHILLING
THIS IS THE LAST YOU'LL SEE O ME
I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO A SINGLE BIT OF PATTER FOR IT ANYHOW
IT WAS A HAPPY DAY
AND THEY SHOOK HANDS AND THEN BEALE SAID THE GARDEN'S LOOKING WELL AND THE OLD MAN OWNED THAT THE GARDEN UD DO ALL RIGHT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SNAILS
LET'S EAR WHAT E SAYS IN THE MORNING
THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE OF MORE TALK THAT DAY
AND IT ISN'T!--IT ISN'T!--IT ISN'T QUITE SOON DICKIE WAS ABLE TO WALK DOWN-STAIRS AND OUT INTO THE GARDEN ALONG THE GRASSY WALKS AND LONG ALLEYS WHERE FRUIT TREES TRAINED OVER TRELLISES MADE SUCH PLEASANT GREEN SHADE AND EVEN TO TRY TO LEARN TO PLAY AT BOWLS ON THE LONG BOWLING-GREEN BEHIND THE HOUSE
I MEAN EVEN A LAME BOY COULD RIDE HIM
THAT WAS WHY WHEN NEXT HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS COUSINS HE BEGAN LOOK HERE--YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE YOUR MAGIC ANY MORE TO GO AND LOOK FOR THE TREASURE
AND BY THE FRONT DOOR SAT AN OLD MAN IN A WINDSOR CHAIR WITH A BROWN SPANIEL AT HIS FEET AND A BIRD IN A WICKER CAGE ABOVE HIS HEAD AND HE WAS NODDING FOR IT WAS A HOT DAY AND HE WAS AN OLD MAN AND TIRED
NOW SHE SAID THE GARDENER HE HAS GOT A FEW HAMPERS READY--FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND THE LIKE--AND HE DRIVES EM TO THE STATION FORE ANY ONE'S UP
I WILL COME BACK
HE GAZED A MOMENT MUTTERED SOMETHING AND MADE ONE JUMP TO THE BACK DOOR
OH WHAT A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEE DICKIE CRIED PAGE 147 HAVE PATIENCE WITH ME LAUGHED SEBASTIAN
HE CHANGED THE GOLD PIECES STAMPED WITH THE IMAGE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH FOR OTHERS STAMPED WITH THE IMAGE OF QUEEN VICTORIA
I BELIEVE YOU SAID THE MAN
THERE WAS NOT A SIGN OF THE INSCRIPTION WHICH DICKIE HAD SCRATCHED ON THE STONE WHEN THE ROUNDHEADS WERE BATTERING AT THE GATES OF ARDEN CASTLE
BEALE ON ALL FOURS RETRIEVED THE BOXES
SHOVIN YOURSELF IN SHE SAID RUDELY
NOT THAT IT'S ANY GOOD
AND THANK YOU KINDLY
THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS NEW AND IT COST TENPENCE HALFPENNY
AND ONE HAPPINESS WAS TO ALL THE OTHER HAPPINESSES OF THAT DAY AS THE SUN IS TO LITTLE STARS--AND THAT HAPPINESS WAS THE HAPPINESS OF BEING ONCE MORE A LITTLE BOY WHO DID NOT NEED TO USE A CRUTCH
THE ONLY THING WHICH MADE DICKIE AT ALL UNCOMFORTABLE WAS WHEN SHE TURNED SUDDENLY TO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE AND SAID DOESN'T HE REMIND YOU OF ANY ONE LORD ARDEN AND LORD ARDEN SAID PERHAPS HE DOES WITH THAT SORT OF LOOK THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY MEAN
AND TOWERING HIGH ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE--OH THREE TIMES AS HIGH AS DICKIE HIMSELF--THERE WAS A FLOWER--A GREAT FLOWER LIKE A SUNFLOWER ONLY WHITE
BUT DICKIE HELD OUT HIS ARMS
THE FOOD STILL LEFT IN HIS POCKETS SERVED FOR SUPPER AND YOU COULD DRINK QUITE WELL AT THE WASH-HOUSE TAP BY PUTTING YOUR HEAD UNDER AND TURNING IT ON VERY SLOWLY
I GIVE YOU A PRESENT AND YOU COME TO PLEDGE IT WITH ME
IF THE SPELL OF THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE RATTLE AND THE WHITE SEAL WAS NOT CERTAIN TO TAKE HIM WHERE HE WISHED TO BE NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS CERTAIN
I DON'T KNOW AS I EVER NOTICED BEFORE QUITE WOT A LITTLE UN YOU WAS
ALL RIGHT I'LL STOP A BIT TILL YOU CATCH UP
WELL AT ANY RATE IT'S PLEASANT TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN SHE SAID
TO GO BACK TO THE TIMES WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING AND NEVER TO RETURN TO THESE TIMES AT ALL
HIS HEAD GREW VERY HOT AND HIS HANDS AND FEET VERY COLD
IT'S ONLY WHAT IS IT THEN SAID BEALE IN THE ACCENTS OF LONG-DISUSED TENDERNESS
EDRED IT IS DICKIE
AND THEY WERE GOING TO ARDEN--TO THAT PLACE BY THE SEA WHERE DICKIE'S UNCLE IN THE OTHER LIFE HAD A CASTLE AND WHERE DICKIE WAS TO MEET HIS COUSINS AFTER HIS SEVEN MONTHS OF WAITING
I SEE IM AS PLAIN AS I SEE YOU
A BOX AIN'T IT A BOX SAID DICKIE SMOOTHING A ROUGH CORNER
BUT WHY ASKED THE LONG-NOSED GENTLEMAN--"WHY PUT BOYTH IN BATHKETTH
AND WHEN HE HAD DONE IT SHE GAVE HIM TWO GREEN APPLES
AND ON THAT THERE WAS NO DOG BUT SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
AT LAST ELFRIDA PUT HER ARMS ROUND HER FATHER'S NECK AND WHISPERED
IT WAS GREAT FUN AND AFTERWARDS MR BEALE LOOKED QUITE DIFFERENT
YES COURSE THEY MUST AVE COME TO THINK OF IT
THE OPPORTUNITY DID NOT COME TILL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS BOILING A KETTLE ON A SPIRIT-LAMP AND ONE HAD GONE OUT TO GET CAKES IN DICKIE'S HONOR WHICH MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE BUT DUTY IS DUTY AND OVER THE GRAVESEND LODGING-HOUSE THE STAR OF DUTY SHONE AND BECKONED
IT WAS A BILL FOR THREE SHIP'S GUNS AND COMPASSES AND SIX FLAGS WHICH MR BEALE HAD BOUGHT FOR HIM IN LONDON FOR THE FITTING OUT OF A LITTLE SHIP HE HAD MADE TO ORDER FOR THE SMALL SON OF THE AMIABLE PAWNBROKER
AND SO TO WORK HE FETCHED OUT FROM THE SHED THE RIBS OF THE LITTLE GALLEON THAT HE AND DICKIE HAD BEGUN TO PUT TOGETHER AND THE TWO SET TO WORK ON IT
YET NOBLE DEEDS MAY CHANCE AT ANY TIME
THEY GAVE HIM GRAPES AND A BANANA AND SOME MARIE BISCUITS AND THEY FOLDED SACKS FOR HIM TO LIE ON
IT MAKES IT SEEM NOT REAL
I LAY THEY'LL KEEP ON A-COMING UP FOREVER AND EVER
HE CLIMBED IN DRAGGING HIS CRUTCH AFTER HIM
AND THEN CAME THE DAY WHEN THE NURSE HAVING DRESSED HIM BADE HIM WALK TO THE WINDOW INSTEAD OF BEING CARRIED AS SO FAR HE HAD BEEN
COURSE THEY AIN'T THE MAID REJOINED
HE TOOK TWO STEPS THREE FOUR--AND THEN HE TURNED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG HIMSELF AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BED AND HID HIS FACE IN HIS ARMS
EDRED SCRAMBLED UP
AT LEAST I DO FRIGHTFULLY
HOW DID SHE KNOW
BUT HE SAW THEM TALKING EAGERLY TO EACH OTHER
THIS JUST MEANT THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS A DREAM
DO SAID DICKIE BITTERLY LAY ME OUT IF YOU WANT TO
HE FOUND THEM WHISPERING IN A CORNER
HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS POOR LITTLE LAME DICKIE HARDING WITH NO RIGHT TO THAT OTHER NAME WHICH HAD BEEN HIS IN THE DREAM
HOW WOULD IT BE DICKIE SPOKE SLOWLY IF I TRIED TO SEE THE MOULDIERWARP
HE SAID VERY GENTLY AND QUIETLY AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE THIS ERE WALKING TOWER OF OURS
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH IT COULD HARDLY BE TRUE
I AM TOLD THE CORRECT PLURAL IS CHRYSALIDES BUT LIFE WOULD BE DULL INDEED IF ONE ALWAYS USED THE CORRECT PLURAL THEY WERE TWO FORLORN FACES THAT LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS EDRED SAID NOW THE POETRY I CAN'T SAID ELFRIDA BURSTING INTO TEARS AGAIN
AMELIA WAS GIVING THE SCULLERY FLOOR A THOROUGH SCRUB OVER AND HAD FASTENED THE DOOR TO AVOID HAVING IT OPENED WITH SUDDENNESS AGAINST HER STEAMING PAIL OR HER CROUCHING FORM
DON'T YOU LET ON YOU SEEN ME WHERE YOU BEEN ASKED THE BOY CURIOUSLY
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE HE ASKED
WAIT AND THINK ELFRIDA IMPLORED
AND ALL'S STRONG AGAIN--NO BONES BROKEN
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS TO EAT IN SILVER DISHES AND THE VERY EGGS HAD SILVER CUPS TO SIT IN AND ALL THE SPOONS AND FORKS HAD DOGS SCRATCHED ON THEM LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS CARVED ON THE FOOT-BOARD OF THE BED UP-STAIRS
I SAW IT ON THE WEDDING DAY WHEN I WENT TO GET HER PRAYER-BOOK I DON'T WANT TO DRESS UP SAID ELFRIDA
DICKIE FELT HIMSELF ALMOST BURSTING WITH PRIDE
A LADY IN BLACK--HER FIGURE WAS AS SLENDER AS HER HANDS--DREW HIM UP PUT HER ARMS ROUND HIM AND LIFTED HIM ON TO A BLACK BENTWOOD CHAIR
IT FEELS HATEFUL WHEN I THINK PERHAPS THEY'LL HAVE TO TURN OUT JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO TURN UP
THERE'S PLENTY PAPERS"--HE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT AS BED-CLOTHES NEWSPAPERS ARE WARM IF NOISY--"AND GET ON IN THE MORNING AFORE PEOPLE'S UP HE COLLECTED ALL THE PAPER AND STRAW--THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL LITTERED ABOUT IN THE HOUSE--AND MADE A HEAP IN THE CORNER OUT OF THE WAY OF THE WINDOW
NEVER AN ARDEN BETTER
THE RIVER WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL
HESITATED
I COULD HE ADDED QUITE UNTRUTHFULLY GIVE YOU THE GENTLEMAN I WORKED WITH FOR ME REFERENCE--TALBOTT IS NAME IS--A BALD MAN WITH A SQUINT AND RED EARS--BUT P'RAPS THIS'LL DO AS WELL HE PULLED OUT OF ONE POCKET ALL THEIR MONEY--TWO POUNDS EIGHTEEN SHILLINGS--EXCEPT SIX PENNIES WHICH HE HAD PUT IN THE OTHER POCKET TO RATTLE
THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU THEY KNEW THE WAY
AND SUCH LUCK AS THE KIND PAWNBROKER NEVER DREAMED OF
I HAVE KILLED A MAN FOR THE KING AND FOR ARDEN THEY SHUT HIM UP IN THE FUEL SHED AND LOCKED THE DOOR
FOR DICKIE IS NOT LAME NOW
YOU INTEREST ME GREATLY
THE BUNDLES'LL SET ON YER KNEE LIKE A FAT BABBY
I'VE BOUGHT YOU A LITTLE JACKET TO PUT ON O NIGHTS IF IT'S COLD OR WET
BUT HOW
OH NURSE LET ME DO SOMETHING TOO
WE'LL TRAMP IT TAKING IT EASY ALL ROUND THE COAST WHERE GENTS GO FOR THEIR OUTINGS
NOW I'D NEVER A THOUGHT OF A THING LIKE THAT MYSELF--NOT IF I'D LIVED TO A HUNDRED SO I WOULDN'T
BUT WHATEVER ELSE IS FORGOTTEN DICKIE IS REMEMBERED
AND WE ARE TO SEE IT
WISELY OR UNWISELY
ALSO THAT A LITTLE BAD GRAMMAR IS A TRIFLE TO A MIGHTY MOULDIWARP
HE KNEW HOW CLEVER DICKIE WAS WITH HIS HANDS FOR HAD HE NOT MADE A WORK-BOX FOR ELFRIDA AND A TOOL-CHEST FOR EDRED BOTH WITH LIDS THAT FITTED
THEN HE LOOKED UP AT THE SKY AND THEN DOWN AT THE ROAD--THEY WERE RESTING ON A HEAP OF STONES
THERE HE SAID THAT'S WHAT I SCRATCHED THAT SAID EDRED
TIS THE GOOD DOCTOR'S POMANDER WITH SPICES AND PERFUMES IN IT TO AVERT CONTAGION AS IT WARMS IN THE HAND THE PERFUMES GIVE FORTH SAID THE DOCTOR
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND IT WILL BE DANGEROUS
YOU LIE STILL AND THINK AND YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL REMEMBER ME VERY WELL
YOU MUST FORGIVE US IF OUR FAMILY ENTHUSIASMS OBLITERATE OUR MANNERS
YES
YES
THATH ALL THEY TOOK HIM AWAY TO THE BACK OF THE SHOP
AND THEY WERE HIS OWN BEYOND A DOUBT
STOKES COMPANY PUBLISHERS COPYRIGHT 1910 BY FREDERICK A
AND THE ASSISTANT MASTER HAD HAD A LARGER ONE OF THE SAME KIND
IF YOU STUMBLE INTO SOME ONE ELSE'S MAGIC IT NEVER FEELS REAL
WELL THERE IT IS
YOU MIGHT AVE HE TOLD DICKIE FLATTERINGLY BUT I WOULDN'T MYSELF WE DON'T NEED TO SAID DICKIE HASTILY
THIS WAS THE END OF ALL HIS CLEVERNESS
THEN HE DRANK AND LOOKED AT THE GARDEN ABLAZE WITH FLOWERS--BLUSH-ROSES AND DAMASK ROSES AND SWEET-WILLIAMS AND CANDYTUFT WHITE LILIES AND YELLOW LILIES PANSIES LARKSPUR POPPIES BERGAMOT AND SAGE
HE WAS IN HIS SHIRT-SLEEVES TOO AND HIS COAT AND HAT HUNG BEHIND THE BACK-DOOR
LIKE TO DON'T MIND IF I DO SAID DICKIE
I'M NOT GOING ON BEING LORD ARDEN YOU CAN'T HELP IT SAID EDRED
IF YOU'LL LIFT ME DOWN AND GIVE ME ME CRUTCH I'LL OOK IT BUT THE YOUNG LADIES WOULD NOT HEAR OF HIS HOOKING IT
HANDS DRAGGED HIM IN
DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOU CAN ONLY GET AT THE MOULDIESTWARP BY A NOBLE DEED
WHAT COULD HE HAVE MEANT
AND DICKIE LIKED THEM AND WAS GRATEFUL TO THEM--AND WATCHED HIS OPPORTUNITY
I'VE EARNED MINE LONG ENOUGH
LITTLE BY LITTLE SLOW AND SURE YOU MUST NOT THINK SAID DICKIE THAT IT'S ONLY PLAY AND THAT I DO NOT NEED TO LEARN BECAUSE I AM MY FATHER'S SON SHOULD I THINK SO SEBASTIAN ASKED
AND I HEAR HIM SAY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY NURSE I HAD MIGHTY STRANGE DREAMS--OF ANOTHER LIFE THAN THIS FORGET THEM SHE SAYS
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED WITH MOTHER-OF-PEARL CARD COUNTERS
DON'T TRY TO BELIEVE IT IF IT HURTS YOU DICKIE DEAR
DON'T LAUGH NURSE
EVERY KIND OF DRESS YOU CAN THINK OF WAS THERE
HIS ARMS WERE BOUND TOO
SOMETIMES IT COMES BY THE SAYING OF A CHARM
DIFFERENT I MEAN FROM THE EDRED AND ELFRIDA YOU'VE BEEN USED TO THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE STOPPED-CLOCK FEELING CAME STRONGLY ON DICKIE AND HE NODDED
THAT WHEN HE GREW UP HE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO LOOK AFTER HIS SERVANTS AND LABORERS AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN WHOM HE WOULD HAVE UNDER HIM--THAT THEIR HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING WOULD BE HIS CHARGE
THE CONFIDANT MADE NO REPLY BUT DICKIE WAS SURE THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE THE CONFIDANT DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE STORY
SO HE PICKED UP HIS CRUTCH AND GOT UP FROM THE MILESTONE WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING AND SET OFF TO WALK DOWN TO THE CASTLE
HO YUSS
IT USED TO RUN THAT WAY
HE WAS SO MUCH STRONGER THEN
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME IF I DIDN'T TWAS BECAUSE YOU NEVER ASKED I--I DIDN'T DARE TO HE SAID DREAMILY
I AIN'T SURE AS I ADN'T BETTER STICK TO THE ROAD AND KEEP AWAY FROM OLD ANDS LIKE YOU JIM DOIN WELL EH SAID JIM
IT'S SHUT UP TO LET APPLY ROBERTS 796 BROADWAY SAID THE BOY
I THOUGHT I'D GOT TO SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT SHE SAT DOWN ON THE BED AND BEGAN TO DRESS HIM SOOTHING HIM BACK TO CONFIDENCE WITH GENTLE TOUCHES AND PET NAMES
HE HAD JUST DONE THE BEST HE COULD AND TRIED TO HELP BEALE AND THE DOGS AND THE MAN WHO HAD THOUGHT HIMSELF TO BE LORD ARDEN HAD SAID I AM PROUD THAT HE SHOULD BE THE HEAD OF OUR HOUSE AND ALL THE ARDEN FOLK HAD CHEERED
WE'RE GOING TO BE EVEN WITH OLD PARROT-NOSE SAID EDRED BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE IN IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING AWAY AND YOU'VE GOT TO STAY HERE AND WHATEVER WE DECIDE TO DO YOU'LL GET THE BLAME OF IT I DON'T SEE SAID RICHARD WHY I SHOULDN'T HAVE A HAND IN WHAT I'VE WANTED TO DO THESE FOUR YEARS HE HAD NOT KNOWN THAT HE HAD KNOWN THE TUTOR FOR FOUR YEARS BUT AS HE SAID THE WORDS HE FELT THAT THEY WERE TRUE
MORE AND MORE IT CAME HOME TO DICKIE THAT THIS WAS WHAT HE HAD TO DO
HE WAS A SINGULARLY WELL-EDUCATED DOG
NOT ELFRIDA DICKIE CAN ONLY BE RANSOMED AT A GREAT PRICE AND IT MUST BE PAID BY YOU
I DUNNO
I DUNNO
NONSENSE OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY A RAT
BUT I CAN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION
ALL THE COUNTRY SIGHTS AND SOUNDS THAT YOU HARDLY NOTICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE KNOWN THEM EVERY YEAR AS LONG AS YOU CAN REMEMBER WERE WONDERFUL MAGIC TO THE LITTLE BOY FROM DEPTFORD
SO NOW WE'VE GOT A OME OF OUR OWN SAID BEALE RUBBING HIS HANDS WHEN THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE HOUSE TOGETHER
IT'S A CRIPPLE'S HOME BY RIGHTS I SHOULD THINK BEALE HAD NOT FORESEEN THIS DIFFICULTY AND HAD NO STORY READY
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE BEST AND BRAVEST CANNOT DO
GO BACK TO YER TALBOTS SAID BEALE
WHATEVER YOU TELLS ME TO SAY HE SAID
WANTS TURNING OVER'S WHAT I THINK--AGAINST THE WINTER
I GOT A TRADE I AVE
WHO ARE YOU NOW DON'T YOU BEGIN TO WANDER AGAIN SAID THE WOMAN IN THE CAP
THREE CHEERS FOR RICHARD LORD ARDEN CHAPTER XII THE END WHAT A TRIUMPH FOR LITTLE LAME DICKIE OF DEPTFORD
ANOTHER--NO
HE STOOD UP STRAIGHT MOVED THE FOOT THAT HE HAD BEEN USED TO MOVE--THEN THE OTHER THE ONE THAT HE HAD NEVER MOVED
THE DREAMS COULD WAIT
BUT BEFORE THE LIGHT WAS WHOLLY GONE THE BOX HAD WHOLLY COME--WITH THE CARVED COAT OF ARMS AND THE LID THAT FITTED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT SOMETHING
AN ONCE I SEE A ELEPHANT WILD ASKED DICKIE THRILLING
FOR HE WHO WAS CALLED RICHARD HARDING IS RICHARD ARDEN AND IT IS HE WHO IS LORD ARDEN AND NOT YOU OR YOUR FATHER
FOR THE MAN NEXT DOOR HAD GONE OFF TO LOOK FOR WORK DOWN ASHFORD WAY WHERE THE HOP-GARDENS ARE AND THE HOUSE WAS TO LET
ONE SHILLING DICKIE KNEW ALL ABOUT PAWN-TICKETS
AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN BY A MAN IN A COMPLETE SUIT OF LEATHER AND WHEN DICKIE LOOKED IN THAT MAN'S FACE HE SAW THAT IT WAS THE FACE OF THE MAN WHO HAD LIVED NEXT DOOR IN LAVENDER TERRACE ROSEMARY LANE--THE MAN WHO DUG UP THE GARDEN FOR THE PARROT SEED
EVER BEEN ON THE BOAT NO SAID DICKIE
THEY'RE SURE TO FIND HIM THE PLEECE DICKIE CRIED IN HORROR
HAD HIS AUNT FOUND THEM AND TAKEN THEM AWAY
BUT IN HIS HEART HE WAS NOT GLAD
AND NOW EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND LORD ARDEN WHO WAS SO KIND AND JOLLY THEY WOULD ALL KNOW THAT HE HAD ONCE BEEN A BURGLAR AND THAT SHE HAD WANTED TO ADOPT HIM AND THAT HE HAD BEEN UNGRATEFUL AND HAD RUN AWAY
FIFTH OF ANYTHING YOU LIKE SO LONG AS SHE AIN'T ABOUT SAID HE DRIVING IN THE SPADE
COME SAID THE LADY TURNING BACK THE BED-CLOTHES
IT WAS EXILE
YOU PERFECT BRICK DICKIE WHISPERED BACK
THIS IS THE ONE SUPREME CHANCE OF ALL YOUR LIFE
NOW WE'LL LOOK OUT FOR A SHOP WHERE THEY SELLS THESE ERE HOLD ANTICS SAID BEALE
NEAR THE BED STOOD A STOOL OR TABLE WITH CUPS AND BOTTLES ON IT AND ON THE NECKS OF THE BOTTLES PARCHMENT LABELS WERE TIED THAT STUCK OUT STIFFLY
SO DICKIE KNEW WHAT RABBITS WERE LIKE
MUCH MUCH MORE BEALE WITHOUT MORE WORDS MADE ROOM FOR HIM IN THE CROWDED PERAMBULATOR AND THEY WENT ON
BUT PRESENTLY HE REMEMBERED
BUT AT LAST HIS MIND WAS MADE UP
I THOUGHT IT UD BE A LARK
I HAVE NO CLAIM TO THE TITLE HE WENT ON GRIMLY
AND THE MOULDIERWARP SAID WHAT IS YOUR DESIRE AND EDRED SAID WE WANT DICKIE PLEASE THEN THE MOULDIESTWARP SAID AND IT WAS TO EDRED THAT HE SAID IT DICKIE IS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO WILL KEEP HIM FROM YOU FOR MANY A DAY UNLESS YOU YOURSELF GO ALONE AND RESCUE HIM
AND THEY HAVE TO BE DEAD AND GONE PEOPLE'S DRESSES AND YOU'LL ONLY GO TO THE DEAD AND GONE PEOPLE'S TIME WHEN THE DRESSES WERE WORN
AND WHEN SHE WAS GONE EDRED SAT DOWN ON THE BOX AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED AND TRIED TO THINK
LET'S CATCH IM AND TAKE IM ALONG E AIN'T LOOSE--'E'S WILD MR BEALE EXPLAINED
AND NOW HE WAS AWAKE
INSTEAD HE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED THE HOUSE IN ALL ITS FIVE ROOMS
THERE'S A DREAM THAT FEELS REAL--ABOUT A DREADFUL PLACE--OH SO DIFFERENT FROM THIS
AND WHEN DICKIE AWOKE AND LOOKED IN HER KIND EYES HE FELT QUITE SURE THAT IF HE HAD HAD A MOTHER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THIS LADY
SO NOW I MAKE YOU A FAIR OFFER
MORE YOU AIN'T SAID THE MAN HESITATED AND PULLED HIS HAND OUT OF HIS POCKET
IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON THAT HALF-WAY UP A HILL THEY SAW COMING OVER THE CREST A LADY AND A LITTLE GIRL
IF I GET OUT OF THIS I'LL STICK TO THE WOOD-CARVING AND NOT GO VENTURING ABOUT ANY MORE AMONG DREAMS AND THINGS HE GOT UP AND LOOKED OUT OF A NARROW WINDOW
AND DICKIE AND MR BEALE NOW POSSESSED TWENTY-SEVEN POUNDS
THEY DON'T JUST SEE THAT GRAY IS MADE OF BLACK AND WHITE
TRAMPING ALONE AIN'T NO BEANO TO ME
YOU MIGHT DO DIFFERENT COATS OF ARMS--SEE I WAS ONLY TAUGHT TO DO ONE SAID DICKIE
THE TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES
THEN ANOTHER STONE AND ANOTHER
THE KING HAD SUDDENLY DECIDED THAT THEY AT LEAST HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT
WHERE DID YOU GET THEM THEY WAS GIVE ME SAID MR BEALE RE-KNOTTING HIS HANDKERCHIEF BY A LADY IN THE COUNTRY HE FIXED HIS EYES ON THE SOFT BLUE OF THE DARKENING SKY
UPTHETTING EVERYBODY LIKE THITH HE ADDED CROSSLY
HE FORGOT THAT HE WAS LAME FORGOT THAT HE HAD RUN AWAY--A FACT THAT HAD COST HIM A TWINGE OR TWO OF FEAR OR CONSCIENCE EARLIER IN THE MORNING
THE MAGPIE THAT PERCHED ON A STUMP AND COCKED A BRIGHT EYE AT THE TRAVELLERS
AND DICKIE HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS WRONG
THESE GARDENS ARE GREEN BECAUSE GREEN IS THE COLOR THAT MOST PLEASES AND SOOTHES MEN'S EYES
AND WE WILL SAIL THEM TOGETHER IN THE POND IN THY FATHER'S GARDEN DICKIE STILL DEVOURING THE LITTLE GOLDEN VENTURE WITH HIS EYES SUBMITTED TO THE LEATHER APRON AND FELT IN HIS HAND THE SMOOTH HANDLE OF THE TOOL SEBASTIAN PUT THERE
BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A MOTHER YOU HAVE TO DECIDE EVERYTHING FOR YOURSELF WON'T YOU LET ME HELP YOU SHE ASKED
SO I S'POSE WE'LL AVE TO TAKE THE ROAD AGAIN DICKIE AND HE WERE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE ON A SLOPING FIELD
THE CLOAK WAS OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN NOW AND HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT HE COULD HEAR
ANYHOW IF HE IS LORD ARDEN I SHALL PROBABLY BE APPOINTED HIS GUARDIAN AND WE SHALL ALL LIVE TOGETHER HERE JUST THE SAME
THE LADY WAS BETTER THAN BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS DEAR
ANSWER ME THAT YOUNG CHAP I DON'T KNOW SAID DICKIE BUT WE GOT TO DO IT SOM'OW IT AIN'T TO BE DONE--NOT WITH ALL THE UNEMPLOYED THERE IS ABOUT SAID MR BEALE
FOR THE DOOR OPENED INTO A CLOSE BOX ARBOR AND NO SKY COULD BE SEEN OR ANY SHAPES OF THINGS
HE GOT OFF THE HORSE VERY QUICKLY AND CAME TO HIS FATHER
WHAT COLORED HORSE WOULD YOU CHOOSE--IF A HORSE WERE TO BE YOURS FOR THE CHOOSING
IT ISN'T MY NAME THERE SAID DICKIE
AND I KNOW SOME OF THE NAMES OF THE CONSPIRATORS AND WHO THEY WANTED TO KILL AND EVERYTHING TELL ME SEEMED THE WISEST THING TO SAY AND HE SAID IT AS CARELESSLY AS HE COULD
OUT OF THE THIRD-FLOOR WINDOW UNDOUBTEDLY JUMPED
HE WOULD CUT AWAY SOME OF THE FURZE BRANCHES
WHAT GAMES HE AND THEY COULD HAVE
THE GENTLEMEN SALUTED WITH THEIR DRAWN SWORDS THE LADIES FLUTTERED THEIR SCARVES
IT WAS A GRAND DAY FOR DICKIE
HE TURNED AGAIN QUICKLY AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PAWNBROKER'S
EDRED AND ELFRIDA WERE TO BE TAKEN TO CLIFFVILLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER TO BE MEASURED FOR NEW SHOES AND DICKIE WAS TO GO UP TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH BEALE AND MELIA AND THE DOGS
THE OTHER CHILDREN TURNED HESITATED AND CAME BACK
THY OLD WAY--I KNOW THEE HEARING THE MASTER MARINERS TALES AND SETTING THY PURPOSE FOR A GALLEON OF THINE OWN AND THE GOLDEN SOUTH AMERICAS WHAT'S A GALLEON SAID DICKIE
AND IN THE HARD BED WITH HIS CLOTHES AND HIS BOOTS UNDER THE PILLOWS DICKIE SLEPT SOUNDLY
I LAY YOU'LL GET SOME COLOR IN THEM CHEEKS O YOURS
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO DICKIE LOOKED FORLORNLY OUT OVER THE RIVER
NOT YET SHE SAID
I'M ANXIOUS HE SAID CONFIDENTIALLY TO GET SETTLED ON ACCOUNT OF THE NIPPER
HERE'S A THING AND A VERY PRETTY THING A BACCY-BOX OR A SNUFF-BOX OR A BOX TO SHUT YER GOLD MONEY IN OR YER DIAMONDS
AFTER THAT FIRST DAY A SORT OF SHYNESS CAME OVER THE THREE CHILDREN AND THEY SPOKE NO MORE OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURES THEY HAD HAD TOGETHER BUT JUST PLAYED AT ALL THE ORDINARY EVERY-DAY GAMES TILL THEY ALMOST FORGOT THAT THERE WAS ANY MAGIC HAD EVER BEEN ANY
AND THEY WON'T BURN ME IF THOU'LT ONLY KEEP A STILL TONGUE
HE TOLD THE WHOLE STORY OF IT THAT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED TO HIS ONLY CONFIDANT FROM WHOM HE HID NOTHING
COME OUT OF THY DREAMS
I CAN MAKE SHIFT TO DO THIS LAST PIECE SO THE THREE WENT ON TOGETHER IN FRIENDLY SILENCE
PARENTS AND GUARDIANS WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT DEAR LITTLE CHARLIE HAS A LANGUAGE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE HE USES TO THEM--A LANGUAGE IN WHICH HE TALKS TO THE COOK AND THE HOUSEMAID
YOU GOT TO TAKE THIS HOUSE--THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
WE COULD AFFORD ONE NOW
THEN THE MOULDIWARP SAID WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE KIND MAGIC ELFRIDA ANSWERED
THIS LIFE OF THE RABBIT AS DESCRIBED BY MR BEALE WAS THE CHILD'S FIRST GLIMPSE OF FREEDOM
BE A MAN
HEAD-WORK BODILY EXERCISES WORK HOME LIFE AND JOYOUS HOURS OF PLAY WITH TWO CHILDREN WHO UNDERSTOOD PLAY AS THE POOR LITTLE DIRTY DEPTFORD CHILDREN DO NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT
AND I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE TINKLER BEHIND HE SHOWED THE RATTLE
AND TRAMPLE THE GRASS AT OTHER PLACES
THEY'RE IN THE FURTHER CAVE
AND WHEN HE FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO UNPACK AT ALL BUT WAS JUST GOING HOME TO ITS BED IN AN OLD COACH-HOUSE HE REMEMBERED THE FIRE-WOOD
YES I WILL GO AND LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN LORD ARDEN HAD COME HOME AND HAD GONE TO BED TIRED OUT BY A LONG DAY'S VAIN SEARCH FOR THE LOST DICKIE AND WHEN EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP EDRED GOT UP AND DRESSED
MR BEALE LAUGHED
SAID IT WAS A DINKY DARLING AND SHE WANTED IT
THEY ENJOYED THE MOAT FOR ONE WHOLE DAY AND THEN THE STREAM WAS DAMMED AGAIN AND CONDEMNED TO RUN UNDERGROUND TILL NEXT SPRING BY WHICH TIME THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXAMINED AND CONCRETE LAID TO THEIR BASE LEST THE WATER SHOULD CREEP THROUGH AND SAP THE FOUNDATIONS
GENT SAID HE'D GET HER PLENTY BETTER
ALSO A BROKEN-BACKED COPY OF INGOLDSBY LEGENDS AND ONE OF MRS MARKHAM'S ENGLISH HISTORY WHICH HAD NO BACK AT ALL
THE THOUGHT OF BEING RICHARD LORD ARDEN HE WHO HAD BEEN JUST LITTLE LAME DICKIE OF DEPTFORD OF OWNING THIS GLORIOUS CASTLE OF BEING THE MASTER OF AN OLD NAME AND AN OLD PLACE THIS THOUGHT SANG IN HIS HEART A VERY BEAUTIFUL TUNE
YOU HAVE NOT SAID GOOD-MORNING TO MR ROSCOE ELFRIDA GOOD-MORNING MR ROSCOE SAID ELFRIDA CHEERFULLY
HE WAS VERY HAPPY
THERE YOU AIN'T DONE ME NO ARM ANYWAY SAID DICKIE
MR BEALE WAS SOON ASLEEP AND DICKIE LAY STILL HIS HEART BEATING TO THE TUNE OF THE HOPE THAT NOW AT LAST IN THIS PLACE WHERE IT HAD ONCE COME HIS DREAM WOULD COME AGAIN
HE PREFERRED PLAY TO TALK JUST THEN
THEY MADE A PLOT--THERE WERE A WHOLE LOT OF THEM IN IT THE CLOCK-STOPPING FEELING CAME ON AGAIN
NEVER SEEN THY FATHER AND MOTHER FORSOOTH PERHAPS IT WAS THE FEVER SAID DICKIE FEELING RATHER DECEITFUL
I SHALL PUT HIM TO BED SHE SAID
IT AIN'T FITTEN FOR A LAD AS AS FACED DEATH SAME'S WHAT YOU AVE SAID THE VOICE
IF I GOES I GOES AND IF I STAYS AWAY I STAYS AWAY
ELFRIDA SAID BOTH BOYS AT ONCE PAGE 272 OH HE GASPED AND DICKIE LOOKING UP WHISPERED IT'S ALL UP--_RUN
WELL WELL I'LL ASK NO QUESTIONS AND YOU'LL TELL ME NO LIES EH I SHALL CERTAINLY TELL YOU NO LIES SAID DICKIE WITH THE DIGNITY OF THE DREAM BOY WHO WAS NOT A CRIPPLE AND WAS HEIR TO A GREAT AND GENTLE NAME
OH EDRED
DICKIE COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT BOTH THESE OLD CREATURES WERE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH HIM
LORD ARDEN INDEED THEY WAS AS JOLLY AS JOLLY SAID DICKIE
NOW THEN HE SAID WE'RE A-GOIN TO LAY LOW ERE ALL D'Y WE ARE
COULD YOU SPARE A TRIFLE MUM SAID BEALE VERY GENTLY AND HUMBLY TO ELP US ALONG THE ROAD
IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE WOULD MAKE FUN OF HIM
AND US NOT ABLE EVEN TO GET A BIT OF BLACK FOR HER DICKIE SNIFFED
AND YOU'RE BETTER
THEN A DOZEN TWIGS RUSTLED AND BROKE AND SOMETHING LIKE A GREAT BLACK BIRD SEEMED TO FLY OUT AT HIM AND FOLD HIM IN ITS WINGS
AND IT'S IN HISTORY HE HEARD ELFRIDA SAY
IT'S A LONG WAY SHE SAID IN A TIRED VOICE
DID YOU EVER HAVE A TUTOR CALLED MR PARADOS HE ASKED
HE WAS USED TO THE PERAMBULATOR
PERHAPS IT WAS HIS SHABBY CLOTHES THAT MADE THEM NOT SO SURE WHETHER HE WAS THE DICKIE THEY HAD KNOWN
IT WAS HORRIBLE TO HIM THIS INTRUSION OF THE SCIENTIFIC ATTAINMENTS OF THE UGLY TIMES IN WHICH HE WAS BORN INTO THE BEAUTIFUL TIMES THAT HE HAD GROWN TO LOVE
AND NOW I'LL TEACH THEE TO MAKE A GALLEON LIKE AS I PROMISED WILL YOU INDEED SAID DICKIE TREMBLING WITH JOY AND PRIDE
IT WAS A WEDDING AND I STOPPED TO AVE A SQUINT AND THERE'D BEEN A WATER-CART AS AD STOPPED TO AVE A SQUINT TOO AND MADE A PUDDLE AS BIG AS A TEA-TRAY AND ALL THE PATH WET
AND A SECOND TUTOR VERY SMART IN RED VELVET AND GOLD WITH BREECHES LIKE BALLOONS AND A SHORT CLOAK AND A RUFF WHO WAS AN EXTREMELY JOLLY FELLOW CAME IN THE MORNINGS TO TEACH HIM TO FENCE TO DANCE AND TO RUN AND TO LEAP AND TO PLAY BOWLS AND PROMISED IN DUE TIME TO TEACH HIM WRESTLING CATCHING ARCHERY PALL-MALL RACKETS RIDING TENNIS AND ALL SPORTS AND GAMES PROPER FOR A YOUTH OF GENTLE BLOOD
AVE YOU GOT E'ER A LITTLE BOY HE ASKED PURSUING HIS FIRST WAKING THOUGHT
WOULD THEY KNOW HIM
AND DAY BY DAY THEY EARNED THEIR LIVING
NESBIT BLAND ALL RIGHTS RESERVED SEPTEMBER 1910 TO ROSAMUND PHILIPPA PHILIPS WITH E
I'D BOUGHT THAT BIT OF PAPER AND PENCIL A-PURPOSE
AND YOU'LL LET ME HELP NOBODY CAN HELP NO ONE CAN ADVISE ME EDRED SAID
AND AS THAT IS ALL THE GOOD I CAN FIND TO SAY ABOUT HER I WILL SAY NO MORE
AND THE OTHER KEY UNLOCKED THAT
DICKIE HAD WORKED MUCH LEARNED MUCH AND EARNED MUCH
WHEN THE PALE YOUNG MAN CAME BACK WITH SOMETHING WRAPPED IN A BIT OF CLEAN RAG HE SAID A WHISPERED WORD OR TWO TO THE PAWNBROKER WHO UNROLLED THE RAG AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE RATTLE
THAT'S THE SOFT WATER THAT IS
I MIGHT HAVE ASKED HE SAID PRESENTLY BUT I HAVE FORGOT WHAT THE PROMISE WAS--THE FEVER AY AY POOR LAD
YOU STICK TO THAT FATHER HAD SAID LOOKING DREADFULLY CLEAN IN THE STRANGE BED AMONG ALL THOSE OTHER CLEAN BEDS
THEY'VE GOT THOSE PICTURES OF IT AS IT USED TO BE
SUPPOSE DICKIE WAS NOT AT BEALE'S
DON'T TRY TO BELIEVE IT
ON THE FOOT-BOARD OF THE GREAT BED WAS CARVED A SHIELD AND A GREAT DOG ON IT
AND THE TUTOR WAS DELIGHTED TO SET HIM TO LEARN A PARTICULARLY HARD AND UNINTERESTING PIECE OF POETRY BEGINNING HAPPY IS HE WHO TO SWEET HOME RETIRED SHUNS GLORY SO ADMIRED AND TO HIMSELF LIVES FREE
LEAVES MORE ROOM SAID THE MAN NEXT DOOR LEANING ON HIS SPADE
AFTER DARK THEY CARRIED THE BLANKETS AND THINGS IN
I DON'T KNOW AS THERE IS SAID MR BEALE DREARILY
AMELIA'D DO FOR THEM A FAIR TREAT ALL BUT FAN AND FLY AS UD GO ALONG OF US
YOU'RE GOIN UP IN THE WORLD SAYS YOU
I LIKES IT
YOU'LL LEND ME THIS
YOU MUST GO ON TRYING TO IMPROVE YOUR MIND SAID THE PAWNBROKER FUSSILY
HA MY CURE PLEASES THEE
IT WAS MY FAULT
BUT THINK OF YOUR FATHER SAID SOMETHING ELSE WHICH WAS HIMSELF TOO
MR BEALE WAITING FOR HIM BY NEW CROSS STATION PUT HIS EMPTY PIPE IN HIS POCKET AND STROLLED DOWN TO MEET HIM
I CAN'T TELL YOU
I THAT HAVE SAILED WITH CAPTAIN DRAKE AND CAPTAIN RALEIGH AND SEEN HOW A GENTLEMAN VENTURER NEEDS TO TURN HIS HAND TO EVERY GUESS CRAFT
NOR YET HER HAIR NOR NUFFINK OF THAT SORT DID YOU SLEEP WELL SHE ASKED HIM STROKING HIS HAIR WITH EXTRAORDINARY GENTLENESS
WHEN HE GOT OUT OF THE TRAM DICKIE ASKED THE WAY AGAIN THIS TIME OF A WOMAN WHO WAS SELLING MATCHES IN THE GUTTER
SO HE CREPT DOWN INTO THE PARLOR WHERE A LITTLE LAYER OF CLEAR RED FIRE STILL BURNED
THE SCRATCHING WENT ON
THEY EXCHANGED SUCH GLANCES AS MIGHT PASS BETWEEN TWO ACTORS AS THE CURTAIN GOES DOWN ON A SUCCESSFUL DRAMATIC PERFORMANCE
THE ESCAPE 58 IV
AN ENORMOUS DARK CUPBOARD OR WARDROBE LOOMED AGAINST ONE WALL
AND MOST OF ALL HE LOVED THE QUIET NIGHTS WHEN HE FELL ASLEEP UNDER THE STARS WITH TRUE IN HIS ARMS
AND THEN LORD ARDEN HANDED THE SEAL AND TINKLER TO HIM AND WENT ON WITH HIS QUESTIONS
HE DID NOT WANT THE LIFE AT LAVENDER TERRACE
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS SO OLD AS ALL THIS AND HE REMEMBERED HEARING HIS FATHER SIR RICHARD ARDEN SAY TREASON'S A DANGEROUS WORD TO LET LIE ON YOUR LIPS THESE DAYS SO HE SAID TIS NOT A MERRY SONG COUSIN NOR A SAFE ONE
KIDNAPPED 228 X
I LOVE IT HE DID NOT ALLOW HIMSELF MUCH TIME FOR LOVING IT HOWEVER
WHEN I'VE GONE YOU CAN PUT THE MOON-SEEDS IN YOUR POCKET AND GO HOME
BUT HE DID NOT NEED TO REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD
YOU SHAN'T GO WITHOUT YOU WANTS TO MATEY
THEY WANT THE TREASURE TO RESTORE THE SPLENDOR OF THE OLD CASTLE WHICH IN YOUR TIME IS FALLEN INTO RUIN AND DECAY AND TO MEND THE HOUSES OF THE TENANTS AND TO DO GOOD TO THE POOR AND NEEDY
HERE YOU ARE HE SAID
AND NEXT FRIDAY AS EVER IS COME YOUR LITTLE COUSINS THEY CAME
DON'T FATHER SHUT YOUR MUG WHISPERED THE RED-WHISKERED MAN
BUT I TUMBLED TO THAT MUCH
I MEANT IT SAID DICKIE AT LAST SPEAKING VERY EARNESTLY
WHAT FOR ASKED THE VOICE WHICH DICKIE NOW PERCEIVED CAME FROM A GENTLEMAN IN RUMPLED HAIR AND A VERY LOOSE PINK FLANNEL SUIT WITH CORDY THINGS ON IT SUCH AS SOLDIERS HAVE
IN THE END THE BOYS STAYED WITHIN AND IT WAS ONLY ELFRIDA AND HER FATHER WHO SAW THE STREAM EMERGE
HOW AMELIA CAME DOWN FROM LONDON AND WAS MARRIED IN ARDEN CHURCH
YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH WHAT MIXED FEELINGS THE CHILDREN WONDERED WHETHER THEY WOULD RATHER STAY IN THE CAVE AND SEE THE DAM DEMOLISHED OR STAY OUTSIDE AND SEE THE STREAM RUSH OUT
RALEIGH AND DRAKE DID YOU KNOW THE BOYS KISSED SHYLY AND AWKWARDLY
MORE FOOL ME SAID THE JEW FEELING IN HIS POCKET
I'VE GOT TO DO IT OFF MY OWN BAT IF I DO IT AT ALL
DICKIE COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THE DIRTY SHIRT THE DIRTY FACE THE THREE DAYS BEARD THE FILTHY CLOTHES OF HIS FRIEND AND HE THOUGHT OF HIS OTHER FRIEND SEBASTIAN OF THE DOCKS
AN WE'LL GIVE YER FIVE BOB A WEEK
AND NOW MY LAMB I'VE MORE TO TELL THEE
YOU ARE NOT A NATIVE OF THESE PARTS I THINK NO BUT MY ADOPTED FATHER IS SAID DICKIE AND I CAME FROM LONDON WITH HIM TO SEE HIS FATHER WHO IS OLD MR BEALE AND WE ARE STAYING AT HIS COTTAGE LORD ARDEN SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM ON THE TURF AND ASKED DICKIE A GOOD MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE HE WAS BORN AND WHO HE HAD LIVED WITH AND WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND DONE AND BEEN
BUT HE WAS MORE BRAVE THAN HE WAS FRIGHTENED WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF BRAVERY AFTER ALL
MAKE THE BEST OF THYSELF DEAR HEART LEST HE BLEED THEE AND DRENCH THEE YET AGAIN WHICH I KNOW IN MY HEART THOU'RT TOO WEAK FOR IT
THERE WAS A TANGLE OF GREEN GROWTH AT THE END OF THE GARDEN AND THE NEXT GARDEN WAS FULL OF WEEDS
OH MOULDIWARP YOU SAID WE MUST NOT HAVE ANY MORE MAGIC
BURIED TREASURE 144 VII
ARST ER TWO THICK UNS I DID
HE WILL ENJOY IT SO SO HE WAS FETCHED
WHAT D'YOU SAY TO STOPPING ALONG OF ME A BIT MY BOY
POETRY'S THE LAST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU'RE MIZZY WE COULD DRESS UP ANYWAY SAID EDRED HOPEFULLY
AN E GOT ME TO CHUCK THE CADGIN AN WORSE
WELL THAT'S A GOOD UN HE SAID AS GOOD A ONE AS EVER I HEARD
BUT BEALE WAS CERTAINLY FOND OF DOGS
WITH HIS LITTLE CRUTCH MADE OUT OF A WORN-OUT BROOM CUT DOWN TO HIS LITTLE HEIGHT HE COULD MANAGE QUITE WELL IN SPITE OF HIS LAMENESS
WHILE HE WHO STRIVES WITH PRIDE TO CLIMB THE SKIES FALLS DOWN WITH FOUL DISGRACE BEFORE HE DIES DICKIE COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WHO WERE TO BE HIS IN THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD MIGHT HAVE PREFERRED SOMETHING SIMPLER AND MORE AFFECTIONATE FROM THEIR LITTLE BOY THAN THIS DIFFICULT PIECE WHOSE LAST VERSE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHICH SEEMED TO DICKIE TO MEAN ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
THERE WERE TWO BEDROOMS FOR BEALE AND HIS FATHER AND DICKIE SLEPT IN A NARROW WHITEWASHED SLIP OF A ROOM THAT HAD ONCE BEEN A LARDER
THAT THOU CANST NOT
HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GROUND AND CRIED AND WRIGGLED WITH MISERY AND PAIN AND WISHED--AH MANY THINGS
YOU'VE BEEN SO KIND TO ME HE SAID
IS IT A BARGAIN ILLUSTRATION
THERE IS A TABLET IN THE CHURCH WHICH TELLS OF THE DEATH BY DROWNING OF RICHARD SIXTEENTH LORD ARDEN
SHE IS ALWAYS MERRY AND FULL OF MANY INVENTIONS BUT THE TUTOR WOULD NOT BE SILENCED
AND I'D GOT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS REALLY REAL I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU'RE SAYING SAID EDRED
HE MUST SLIP AWAY AND LET THE FATHER OF EDRED AND ELFRIDA BE AS HE HAD BEEN LORD ARDEN
THE BIG KEY WITH THE ARMS ON IT CRIED ELFRIDA
NEXT MORNING MR BEALE SHAVED A THING HE HAD NOT DONE SINCE THEY LEFT LONDON
BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR OWN OLD NURSE I NEVER AD NO NURSE SAID DICKIE OLD NOR NEW
YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR RIGHTS MY DEAR BOY AND I SHAN'T BE HURT BY IT
A GRASS SNAKE SLID SWIFTLY BY--IT WAS OUT ON PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF ITS OWN SO IT WAS NOT AFRAID OF DICKIE NOR HE OF IT
YOU CANNOT SEE IT FROM THE STREET
HE SAW THE PALE BLUE REPROACHFUL EYES OF BEALE LOOKING OUT OF THAT DIRTY FACE AND HE SPOKE ALOUD QUITE WITHOUT MEANING TO
CLEAN EM WITH THAT YOU DON'T GIVE YOUR ORDERS NEITHER SAID BEALE CONTENTEDLY
AND THEN SUDDENLY THERE THEY WERE AGAIN WITHIN THE NARROW WALLS OF EDRED'S BEDROOM
I CAN'T GO BACK ON MY PALS MATEY SAID MR BEALE
AND EVERYTHING WAS AS COZY AS COZY COULD BE
BECAUSE BEFORE HE GOT TO THE SHOP WITH NO WINDOW TO IT BUT ONLY SHUTTERS THAT WERE PUT UP AT NIGHT WHERE THE WOOD AND COAL WERE SOLD HE SAW A PUNCH AND JUDY SHOW
HE STUCK TO IT AND STUCK TO IT AND STUCK TO IT TILL THERE WAS HARDLY LIGHT LEFT TO SEE IT BY
AND THE OTHER WOULD REPLY NO
THEN HE PUT HIS FEET THROUGH THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN TWO BARS AND SLID THROUGH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW ELFRIDA ASKED BRISKLY
I GOT A DADDY OF MY OWN YOU KNOW WHY SAID MR BEALE STOPPING SUDDENLY YOU SAID HE WAS DEAD SO HE IS SAID DICKIE
AND I'M GOING NOW OH NOT NOW
THE ONLY REALLY NICE THING WAS WHEN WE SAW THE TREASURE BEING HIDDEN BECAUSE THAT LOOKED LIKE A PICTURE AND WE HADN'T TO DO ANYTHING
WHERE'D YOU GET IT I MADE IT THE PAWNBROKER LAUGHED AGAIN
IN ROSE-COLORED BROCADE SHE WAS WITH A GREEN SILK PETTICOAT AND HER POWDERED HAIR DRESSED HIGH OVER A GREAT CUSHION BUT HER EYES AND HER MOUTH WERE THE EYES OF DICKIE OF DEPTFORD
EH MATEY I THINK LET'S SAID DICKIE
IT'S MANY A LONG DAY SINCE THOU WAS HERE TO PESTER ME WITH THY QUESTIONS
AND THE MOMENT THAT HE HAD LAIN THE LAST SEED COMPLETING THE CROSSED TRIANGLES THE MAGIC BEGAN AGAIN
THINK THEY'D GOT A MARQUIS IN DISGUISE SO THEY WOULD DICKIE THOUGHT ALL DAY ABOUT THIS GREAT ADVENTURE
AIN'T KIDDIN
HE HEARD ONE OF THE VOICES SAY HUSH
AND NOW SHE ADDED LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW I SPY THE GOOD DOCTOR A-COMING
HE DID NOT TELL MR BEALE SO BUT HE WAS VERY PROUD OF BEING SO TRUSTED
I WASN'T KIDDING YOU
THERE WAS MORTAR OR CEMENT AT THEIR EDGES AND WHEN THE LAST STONE WAS REPLACED NO ONE COULD TELL THOSE STONES FROM THE OTHER STONES THAT FORMED THE WALL
THERE WAS A CLATTER LIKE PAILS AND SOMETHING HARD AND SMOOTH HIT HIM ON THE KNEE
I DO LIKE YOU MR BEALE LOOKED AT HIM THROUGH THE DEEPENING TWILIGHT--RATHER QUEERLY DICKIE THOUGHT
WHEN SUPPER WAS OVER--IT WAS TRIPE AND ONIONS AND FRIED POTATOES VERY LUXURIOUS--BEALE GOT UP AND STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE
THIS JOYFUL THOUGHT PUT THE CROWN ON HIS HAPPINESS
I SHALL GET AWAY ALL RIGHT NO SAID EDRED AND THEN WITH A JOYOUS LEAP OF THE HEART PERCEIVED THAT THE DARK FIGURE WAS ELFRIDA IN HER FATHER'S ULSTER
I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE MEN DO THIS BUT EVERY LONDON BOY WHO READS THIS WILL KNOW
DON'T YOU TELL ME AUNT YER AUNT
DREAMS GO TO THE MAKING OF ALL PROPER MEN
IT'S PARROT FOOD THAT IS IT SAID THE AR-SOMETHING BIRD SEED SAID DICKIE DOWNCAST
LEND ME THE MONEY TO TAKE ME TO GRAVESEND AND BY THE HONOR OF A GENTLEMAN I WILL REPAY YOU WITHIN A MONTH THE VOICE WAS FIRM
EDITH NESBIT
I'LL NEVER TRY IT AGAIN HE SAID
IT WAS THE FIRST TWO WHO TALKED OF THEE AND HOW CAN I FIND MY COUSINS AND HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR FATHER LAY OUT THE MOON-SEEDS AND THE OTHER CHARMS AND WISH TO BE WHERE THEY ARE GOING
WITHIN THERE JUST AS PEOPLE DO IN OLD PLAYS
FOR THE WALLS OF EDRED'S ROOM RECEDED FURTHER AND FURTHER TILL THE CHILDREN FOUND THEMSELVES IN A GREAT WHITE HALL WITH AVENUES OF TALL PILLARS STRETCHING IN EVERY DIRECTION AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE
VERY DISCONTENTEDLY HE FOUND HIS WAY TO HIS PANELLED BED-CLOSET AND TOOK OFF THE SMART VELVET AND FUR WHICH HE HAD WORN IN HIS VISIT TO THE TOWER AND PUT ON HIS EVERY-DAY THINGS
IT WAS A GLORIOUS TREASURE--GOLD AND SILVER PLATE JEWELS AND BEAUTIFUL ARMOR ALONG WITH A PILE OF OLD PARCHMENTS WHICH MR ROSCOE SAID WERE WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE REST PUT TOGETHER FOR THEY WERE THE TITLE-DEEDS OF GREAT ESTATES
SUCH THINGS AS THINK OF YOUR FATHER
YER UNCLE'LL TELL IT YOU WITH ALL DE LAWYER'S REASONS TO-MORROW MORNING AS SURE'S SURE
IT WAS SO SHELTERED AND THE WIND HAD BEEN SO STRONG THAT DICKIE FELT SLEEPY
AND DICKIE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THATCH
BUT IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE TO PRETEND I DON'T KNOW A KODAK WHEN I SEE IT
AND HE WAS REPAYING THEM BY TAKING AWAY FROM THEM PRICELESS POSSESSIONS
MY TUTOR TOLD ME THAT
THE CLEVERNESS OF IT THIS ADMIRATION OF THE CLEVERNESS BY WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN CHEATED SET DICKIE THINKING
I SAY FARVER LET'S GET OUT IN THE WOODS SOMEWHERES QUIET AND TAKE OUR GRUB ALONG
BUT THEY ARE ALL WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE HOUSE OF ARDEN IN THAT BOOK TOO IT IS WRITTEN HOW DICKIE WENT BACK FROM THE FIRST JAMES'S TIME TO THE TIME OF THE EIGHTH HENRY AND TOOK PART IN THE MERRY COUNTRY LIFE OF THOSE DAYS AND THERE FOUND THE OLD NURSE HERSELF EDRED AND ELFRIDA AND HELPED THEM TO RECOVER THEIR FATHER FROM A FAR COUNTRY
DICKIE HE SAID SOFTLY DICKIE BUT NO ONE ANSWERED
THERE WAS A GLORIOUS DINNER AND DICKIE WAITED ON THIS NEW FATHER OF HIS CHANGED HIS PLATE AND POURED WINE OUT OF A SILVER JUG INTO THE SILVER CUP THAT MY LORD DRANK FROM
I'VE GOT THE DIBS FOR YER TICKET DONE UP IN THIS ERE BELT I'M A-GOIN TO PUT ON YOU
AT LAST HE SAID YOU'RE A SHARP LAD YOU ARE--BLOOMIN SHARP
I'VE KEP STEADY AND KEEP STEADY I WILL
AN JOLLY GOOD BUSINESS TOO FINE WEATHER
BUT THEN IF WE COULD GET DICKIE BACK BY DOING A NOBLE DEED WE'D DO IT LIKE A SHOT WOULDN'T WE OH
E CAN TALK LIKE A LITTLE GENTLEMAN ALL RIGHT CAUSE WE EARD IM OH THAT'S THE WAY WE TALKS UP LONDON WAY SAID DICKIE
AND NOW DEAR LAMB SINCE THY TUTOR IS IMAGINING UNKIND THINGS IN HIS HEART FOR THEE GO QUICKLY
FETCH ME A DROP WHEN YOU'VE HAD YOUR DRINK MY LAD OF COURSE DICKIE'S MANNERS WERE TOO GOOD FOR HIM TO DRINK FIRST
A KEEN WIND RUSHED THROUGH IT AND BY THE BLOWN CANDLE'S LIGHT HE COULD SEE SNOWFLAKES WHIRLED INTO THE HOUSE THROUGH THE WINDOW'S DARK STAR-STUDDED SQUARE
I'VE BEEN TRYING ALL THE TIME WE'VE BEEN DRESSING AND I CAN ONLY THINK OF OH CALL DEAR DICKIE BACK TO ME I CANNOT PLAY ALONE
BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE POETRY NO MORE CAN I WHEN I'M AS UNHAPPY AS THIS
THEN THEY ALL WENT DOWN TO THE MOUND AND THE ENGINEER THEN POKED AND PRODDED IT AND SAID HE SHOULD NOT WONDER IF THEY WERE NOT SO FAR OUT
HOW ALL THE DOGS WORE WHITE FAVORS AND HAD EACH A CRUMB OF WEDDING CAKE
I DIDN'T SHE SAID AND STUCK TO IT
ANY ONE UD THINK WE WAS COURTING SO WE BE SAID BEALE AND KISSED MELIA FOR THE FIRST TIME
AT THE THIRD KNOCK BEALE VERY SLEEPY PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW
THE LIFE HE HAD LED IN THAT DREAM-WORLD WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING SEEMED TO HIM NOW A VERY LITTLE THING COMPARED WITH THE PRESENT GLORY OF BEING THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE OF ARDEN OF BEING THE PROVIDENCE THE LOVING OVER-LORD OF ALL THESE GOOD PEASANT FOLK WHO LOVED HIS NAME
COME ON LET'S TURN IN
BE ONE OF US THEN AN INTENSE WHITE LIGHT SHONE SO THAT THE CHILDREN COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE
THE GARDEN WAS MOST INTERESTING AND THE ONLY BLOT ON THE SCENE WAS THE BLACK FIGURE OF THE TUTOR WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH A SOUR FACE AND HIS THUMBS IN ONE OF HIS DULL-LOOKING BOOKS
STILL ONE MUST ALWAYS BE POLITE
HAVE YOU EVER SLEPT OUT-OF-DOORS
WE'VE AD SOME GOOD TIMES HERE IN OUR TIME FARVER AIN'T US HE SIGHED WITH THE AIR OF AN OLD MAN LOOKING BACK ON THE LONG-AGO DAYS OF YOUTH
PERHAPS HE HAD
IT IS A MOONFLOWER OF COURSE HE SAID IF THE OTHER KIND'S SUNFLOWERS
AND DICKIE PULLED OUT TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL AND THE MOON-SEEDS AND LAID THEM ON THE TURF AND EXPLAINED
HE COULD SEE ABOVE HIM THE STARS PLAIN THROUGH A NET OF FURZE BUSHES
THE FEEL OF THE SOFT DUST UNDERFOOT THE BRIGHT DEWY GRASS AND CLOVER BY THE WAYSIDE THE LESSENING OF HOUSES AND THE GROWING WIDENESS OF FIELD AND PASTURE ALL CONTENTED AND DELIGHTED DICKIE
IT WAS LORD ARDEN PUT IT INTO MY ED
JUMP AND THEN A LITTLE FIGURE--EDRED IT MUST BE
NOT IN THE END YOU WON'T SAID DICKIE AS THE PAWNBROKER LAID CERTAIN MONIES BEFORE HIM ON THE MAHOGANY COUNTER
LORD ARDEN POINTED OUT HOW ITS COURSE HAD BEEN DIVERTED AND MADE TO RUN DOWN UNDERGROUND TO THE SEA
TWO MUGS FOUR BILLIARD BALLS AND ARF A DOZEN DOOR-STEPS WAS MR BEALE'S ORDER
LET THE VAPOR OF IT PASS TO AND FRO THROUGH THE CHAMBER BURN THE HERBS FROM THE FLOOR AND ALL SWEEPINGS ON THIS HEARTH
I DON'T SAY AS THEY'RE ACTIN UNNEIGHBORLY IN TALKING ABOUT THE PLEECE SO LONG AS THEY DON'T DO NO MORE THAN TALK SAID BEALE WITH STUDIED FAIRNESS AND MODERATION
WELL SAID MARKHAM YOU'VE GOT A SPIRIT I WILL SAY THAT YOU SEE SAID DICKIE I WANTS TO GET BACK TO FARVER BLESS THE CHILD SAID MARKHAM QUITE AFFECTED BY THIS
WE SHALL LET THE POLICE KNOW
TAKE THE LAMP SHE SAID AND THRUST IT ON HIM
I'D LIKE TO KISS YOU TOO IF YOU DON'T MIND
HIS CLEAR OLD EYES SET IN MANY WRINKLES TURNED FULL ON DICKIE BY THE GATE
ALSO HE WAS A PERSON OF CONSEQUENCE
IT WAS NO LIGHT THING TO COME BACK FROM THAT TO THIS
I WISH TO REPAY YOU GOT THE MONEY SAID THE JEW LAUGHING NOT UNKINDLY
THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW
BUT WE SHAN'T EVER SEE YOU AGAIN DICKIE ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS SO
HE WENT AS QUIETLY AS A MOUSE CREEPING ON HANDS AND KNEE THE LAME FOOT DRAGGING QUIETLY BEHIND HIM
HE LOOKED HESITATED SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WENT IN
BUT SHE DID KEEP DICKIE WHEN HIS FATHER DIED AND SHE MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM TO THE WORK-HOUSE
ALL'S FOR THE BEST AND THE END'S TO COME
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IT WAS DONE ASK SOME GROWN-UP TO TELL YOU HOW LADY NITHSDALE GOT HER HUSBAND OUT OF THE TOWER WHEN HE WAS A PRISONER THERE AND IN DANGER OF HAVING HIS HEAD CUT OFF AND YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF SCHEME IT WAS
WHAT A NIPPER IT IS THOUGH SAID MR BEALE REGRETFULLY
BUT I AM
IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE A FOOL OF A KID AIN'T I GOT CLEVER BROTHERS AND SISTERS INQUIRED THE MAID HER CHIN IN THE AIR
I TOOK NOTICE TOO HE EXPLAINED
THE LITTLE NIPPER SO IT AIN'T
I SHOULD OPE WE'RE A CUT ABOVE A LOW CHAP LIKE WOT E IS
THEN LET ME PLEDGE MY WORD--MY WORD OF HONOR
HE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WITH MASTER ROGER FRY HIS FENCING MASTER BUT HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO THE KENNELMAN
WHY SAID THE MAN NEXT DOOR THAT AIN'T SEEDS
AND WE AIN'T GOT OUR DRORING-ROOM SUIT NEITHER SAID MR BEALE
THAT OLD SHIRT OF MINE
HE HAD BEEN POOR--OR HE HAD DREAMED THAT HE WAS POOR--IT WAS ALL THE SAME
IF ONE COULD GET A LIFT
DICKIE WROTE OUT THEIR ACCOUNTS ON A LARGE FLAGSTONE NEAR THE HORSE TROUGH BY THE CHEQUERS WITH A BIT OF BILLIARD CHALK THAT A MAN GAVE HIM
PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW DO ODD THINGS IN FEVERS THAT THEY WOULD NEVER DO AT OTHER TIMES
SEEMS TO ME TUESDAY'S AS GOOD A DAY AS ANY
AND SUPPOSE HE ADDED STRUCK BY A SUDDEN AND UNPLEASING THOUGHT THERE'S A HOUSE BUILT ON THE PLACE
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T DICKIE FELT A SWIMMING SENSATION
WHERE HE ASKED HESITATINGLY WHERE'S MY
A FAIR TREAT SAID HE
HIS LAME FOOT HURT
HE GOT HIS ARMS ROUND HER BIG COMFORTABLE WAIST
THE SWAN CARRIAGE WENT BACK UP THE CAVE WITH A SWISH AND RUSTLE OF WINGS AND THE CHILDREN WENT DOWN THE HILL AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD--WHICH WAS NOT VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE OF DICKIE'S POOR LAME FOOT
AND HE SLEPT AND DREAMED OF MR BEALE AND THE LITTLE HOUSE AMONG THE FURZE AND THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS
THE WELCOME THAT AWAITED DICKIE AT BEALE'S COTTAGE FROM BEALE AMELIA AND NOT LEAST THE DOGS WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ALL THOUGHTS OF UNLIKELY PLACES OUT OF ANYBODY'S HEAD
WON'T YOU MIND FRIGHTFULLY DADDY ELFRIDA ASKED DURING THIS LONG WAITING IF IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU'RE NOT LORD ARDEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT BEFORE HE DECIDED TO ANSWER HER WITHOUT RESERVE
ALL THE SAME THE TWILIGHT SAW HIM CREEPING DOWN THE OLD ROAD TO THE HOUSE WHOSE BACK-YARD HAD HELD THE RABBIT-HUTCH THE GARDEN WHERE HE HAD SOWED THE PARROT FOOD AND WHERE THE MOONFLOWERS HAD COME UP SO WHITE AND BEAUTIFUL
BUT THERE WERE NO GREEN THINGS GROWING IN THE GARDEN AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WHERE DICKIE LIVED WITH HIS AUNT
WELL TOWN THEN SAID DICKIE WHO WAS TRYING TO INVENT A BOX OF A NEW AND DIFFERENT SHAPE TO BE CARVED NEXT DAY
THE ELFRIDA WHO HAD GONE ON THE BARGE TO GRAVESEND AND PLAYED WITH HIM AT THE DEPTFORD HOUSE HAD NEVER USED SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS A WHOLE LOT OF THEM IN IT HE LOOKED AT HER AND SHE WENT ON THEY SAID LORD ARDEN WAS IN IT BUT HE WASN'T AND SOME OF THEM WERE TO PRETEND TO BE HUNTING AND TO SEIZE THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH AND PROCLAIM HER QUEEN AND THE REST WERE TO BLOW THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT UP WHEN THE KING WENT TO OPEN THEM I NEVER HEARD THIS TALE FROM MY TUTOR SAID DICKIE
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOUR MOUTH SHUT'S A GOOD MOTTO SAID SHE NODDED AGAIN AND TURNED RESOLUTELY AWAY
BUT HE KNEW THAT THIS MUST BE NONSENSE BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU CANNOT SEE THROUGH YOUR EYELIDS
IT IS AN ANGRY LITTLE BEAST AT TIMES BUT KINDLY AND HARD-WORKING THEN DICKIE TOLD HER ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MAGIC AND HOW HE HAD HEARD TWO VOICES ONE OF THEM THE MOULDIWARP'S
IT RAN BETWEEN BANKS OF WILLOWS AND ALDERS WHERE LOOSESTRIFE AND MEADOWSWEET AND WILLOW-HERB AND YARROW GREW TALL AND THICK
AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHY HE FELT UNEASY AND BECAUSE HE FELT UNEASY HE LAUGHED
IT WOULD BE VERY BITTER--IT WOULD BE LIKE LEAVING HOME NEVER TO RETURN
HE PUT THEM INSIDE THE FRONT OF HIS SHIRT AND SHUFFLED DOWN
ONCE I WAS OUTSIDE THE PARK I'D DO ALL RIGHT MUCH AS MY PLACE IS WORTH SAID MARKHAM
HE HAD DECIDED TO WAKE UP--TO WAKE UP TO THE OLD HARD CRUEL LIFE--TO POVERTY DULNESS LAMENESS
WHAT OFFERS AND IT ROUND SAID A BLACK-BROWED WOMAN WITH A BASKET COVERED IN AMERICAN CLOTH NO BLACKER THAN HER EYES
YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM TILL THE END OF THE MAGIC
THE NAME OF ARDEN CHANGED ITSELF AS NAMES DO TO HARDING
THE WOODLAND SHADOWS AND THE LIGHTS OF SUDDEN WATER
IF YOU DON'T BEAT ALL HE SAID
THEN HUMBLY AND THANKFULLY IN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO DO SO FINE AND BRAVE A THING AND TO DRAW NEAR TO THE IMMORTALS OF ALL AGES WHO HAVE SUCH DEEDS TO DO AND HAVE DONE THEM YOU MAY TELL THE TRUTH TO THE ONE WHO LOVES YOU BEST YOUR SISTER ELFRIDA BUT ISN'T ELFRIDA TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BE NOBLE TOO EDRED ASKED
I'VE SOMETHING YET TO DO AND WHEN THE SOLDIERS HAD GONE TO GET FOOD AND STREW IT ABOUT AS THEY HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO DICKIE CREPT UP TO THE STONES THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER TAKEN HIS EYES KNELT DOWN AND SCRATCHED ON ONE OF THE STONES WITH ONE OF THE BIG NAILS HE HAD BROUGHT IN HIS HAND
NURSE SAID HE
HIS CLOTHES HUNG OVER HER ARM HIS DOUBLET AND LITTLE FAT BREECHES HIS STOCKINGS AND THE SHOES WITH ROSETTES
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR HE ADDED IN INJURED TONES FOR ELFRIDA HAD KICKED HIS HAND UNDER THE TABLE
THE SHOP WAS ONE OF THOSE OLD-FASHIONED ONES DIVIDED BY PARTITIONS LIKE THE STALLS IN A STABLE AND OVER THE TOP OF THIS PARTITION THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED A HEAD
IT SEEMED TO BRING CERTAIN THINGS VERY NEAR
SOME ONE TRIPPED AND FELL
AND THE PEOPLE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED--SILLY APES
THE TREE-DOTTED PARKLAND WAS TO DICKIE THE LAND OF HEART'S DESIRE
THE WAY LAY DOWN THE OLD KENT ROAD AND PRESENTLY DICKIE WAS IN FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS
HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AT THE TAPESTRIES AND THE HEAVY FURNITURE
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING WERE THE LAST WORDS OF THE REDHEADED ONE AS HE SLOUCHED OUT AND DICKIE AND BEALE WERE LEFT TO FINISH THE DOOR-STEPS AND DRINK THE COLD TEA THAT HAD SLOPPED INTO THEIR SAUCERS
MAY I RIDE IN THE PRAM FARVER
BUT WHAT DO THESE DOCTORS KNOW OF BABES
BUT DICKIE DID IT
THE TINKLE OF SHEEP-BELLS
YOU MUST NOT EVEN TELL YOUR SISTER TILL YOU HAVE RESCUED DICKIE AND MADE THE SACRIFICE
THAT WAS A RUM DREAM HE TOLD HIMSELF AS HE BLINKED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
I DON'T CARE NOW NOW MATEY"--BEALE'S TONE CHANGED SUDDENLY TO AFFECTIONATE REMONSTRANCE--"I WAS ONLY KIDDIN DON'T TAKE IT LIKE THAT
WELL--SO LONG SHE LOOKED BACK TO SMILE AND NOD TO THEM WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN HER BASKET AND THE TURNING TO THE RIGHT AND DICKIE SUDDENLY STIFFENED ALL OVER AS A POINTER DOES WHEN IT SEES A PARTRIDGE
I SEE HIM IN HIS RUFF AND CLOAK WITH HIS LITTLE SWORD BY HIS SIDE LIVING OUT THE LIFE HE HAS CHOSEN IN THE OLD ENGLAND WHEN JAMES THE FIRST WAS KING
AN WHEN YOU WANT A LIFT--WHY HERE'S YOUR CARRIAGE AND YOU CAN SIT UP ERE AND RIDE LIKE THE LORD MAYOR AND I'LL BE YER HORSE
BUT YOU MUST TAKE IT ALONE
I'LL RAISE THEM IN GENTLE HEAT I THINK THEY GROW BEST BY MOONLIGHT SAID DICKIE
I WISH I'D NEVER COME BACK OUTER THE DREAM SO I DO NOW LOOKEE HERE SAID BEALE STERNLY DON'T YOU COME THIS OVER US CAUSE I WON'T STAND IT D'Y EAR
NOBODY SAYS YOU AIN'T AND NOBODY AIN'T MAKIN A FOOL OF ME SAID DICKIE
TRAINED TO IT FROM A PUP YOU MAY LAY YOUR LIFE
I CAN'T WALK LIKE WOT YOU CAN SHE CARRIED HIM TO THE BATH
AS HE WILLS THE FATHER FIRMLY SAID
THERE'S ONE IN THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY
WE'RE BOUND TO MEET AGAIN SOME DAY
I AIN'T GOT NOBODY BUT YOU ERE--FARVER WELL THEN SAID BEALE MORE GENTLY WHAT DO YOU GO SETTIN OF YOURSELF UP AGIN ME FOR I AIN'T SAID DICKIE
NEXT MOMENT DICKIE'S HANDS WERE TIED WITH A HANDKERCHIEF AND HE STOOD THERE BREATHLESS AND TREMBLING WITH PRIDE
EVERY MAN'S GOT TO MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF ONE TIME OR THE OTHER HE ADDED APOLOGIZING TO THE SPIRIT OF BUSINESS
HE LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR LAY QUITE STILL THERE
THE SERVANTS HALL'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR HONEST PEOPLE AS DON'T BREAK INTO HOUSES ALL THROUGH THAT DAY OF WONDER WHICH INCLUDED REAL ROSES THAT YOU COULD PICK AND SMELL AND REAL GOOSEBERRIES THAT YOU COULD GATHER AND EAT AS WELL AS PICTURE-BOOKS A CLOCKWORK BEAR A MUSICAL BOX AND A DOLL'S HOUSE ALMOST AS BIG AS A SMALL VILLA AN IDEA KEPT ON HAMMERING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF A LOCKED DOOR IN DICKIE'S MIND AND WHEN HE WAS IN BED IT GOT THE DOOR OPEN AND CAME OUT AND LOOKED AT HIM
I THOUGHT YOU'D COME TO YOURSELF SHE SAID
AND NOW CRIED BEALE LET'S AVE A CHEER FOR LORD ARDEN
I'LL WALK ON A BIT
AND ALL WITH THE IMAGE OF OUR LATE DEAR QUEEN SAID THE MOTHER
AND THEN THEY WOULD KNOW THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WELL AND AS AN ARDEN SHOULD
COME ON CHILDIE LET'S MAKE FOR THE MOAT
WHEN THEY ALL WENT A WEEK LATER TO EXPLORE THE CAVES THEY FOUND A CURIOUS ARRANGEMENT OF BRICKWORK AND CEMENT AND CLAY SHUTTING UP A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE STREAM HAD EVIDENTLY ONCE FLOWED OUT INTO THE OPEN AIR
IN THIS VERSE DICKIE WAS MADE TO REMARK THAT HE HOPED PEOPLE WOULD SAY OF HIM HE DIED A GOOD OLD MAN WHICH HE DID NOT HOPE AND INDEED HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS THOUGHT OF
WHETHER I DREAM OR NOT YOU AND ME'LL STAND TOGETHER
BEEN HITTIN OF YOU THEY'VE TOOK AWAY THE UTCH SAID DICKIE
JOE SHE WHISPERED YOU THERE JOE OUTSIDE WHISPERED THAT HE WAS
THEY TOOK THE TRAIN ON MONDAY AND IT LANDED THEM IN A VERY BRIGHT TOWN BY THE SEA
IT WAS HARD TO MAKE HIM LAY THE WORK DOWN EVEN FOR DINNER WHICH WAS OF A DELICIOUS AND EXTRAVAGANT KIND--NEW BREAD GERMAN SAUSAGE AND BEER IN A FLAT BOTTLE
THOU'RT RICHARD ARDEN THERE AS HERE SHE SAID
HIS AUNT AND HER FRIENDS SAID HOW KIND BUT DICKIE HATED IT
ALONE SAID EDRED RATHER BLANKLY
AND SEEK IT IN THE MOST UNLIKELY PLACE AND WITH THAT IT VANISHED ALTOGETHER AND THE DARKNESS WITH IT
HE FELT TO THE FULL ALL THE JOY THAT MR BEALE FELT IN OOFING IT AND WHEN AS THE SUN WAS SINKING THEY OVERTOOK A BENT SLOW-GOING FIGURE IT WAS WITH A THRILL OF REAL PLEASURE THAT DICKIE RECOGNIZED THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN HIM THE BLUE RIBBON FOR TRUE
HE FOUND THAT TO BE AT ARDEN CASTLE WITH EDRED AND ELFRIDA ALL DAY AT PLAY AND AT LESSONS WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING WITH THEM IN THE BEAUTIFUL OLD DREAM-LIFE
WHY YOU LITTLE DUFFER THEY'D BE DEAD LONG BEFORE YOU CAME BACK TO REDEEM THEM THAT'S CERTAIN YOU'D HAVE THEM WHILE THEY WERE ALIVE YOU KNOW SAID DICKIE GENTLY
THE SUN SHONE OVERHEAD AND THE CLEAR RIVER SPARKLED AND MORE AND MORE BOATS ALL GILDED AND FLOWER-WREATHED APPEARED ON THE WATER
IT ISN'T IN YOUR MAGIC AT ALL
THE OTHER TWO CROUCHED IN THE WOOD
AND IN THE GREEN CURTAINS WAS WOVEN A WHITE PATTERN VERY LIKE THE THING THAT WAS ENGRAVED ON TINKLER AND ON THE WHITE SEAL
HE TOLD THE NURSE QUITE PLAINLY THAT HE REMEMBERED NOTHING ABOUT HIMSELF AND AFTER HE HAD TOLD HER SHE WOULD SIT BY HIS SIDE BY THE HOUR AND TELL HIM OF THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE SHORT LIFE OF THE BOY WHOSE PLACE HE FILLED THE BOY WHOSE NAME WAS NOT DICKIE HARDING
QUITE SOON CAME THE DAY WHEN THE NURSE DRESSED HIM IN CLOTHES STRANGE BUT STRANGELY COMFORTABLE AND FINE AND CARRIED HIM TO THE WINDOW FROM WHICH AS HE SAT IN A BIG OAK CHAIR HE COULD SEE THE GREEN FIELDS THAT SLOPED DOWN TO THE RIVER AND THE RIGGING AND THE MASTS OF THE SHIPS THAT WENT UP AND DOWN
WHERE'D YE WANT TO GO MY LORD I'M NOT MY LORD
DICKIE SLEPT WITH TRUE IN HIS ARMS AND IT WAS LIKE A DRAUGHT OF SOFT MAGIC ELIXIR TO LIE ONCE MORE IN THE STILL COOL NIGHT AND LOOK UP AT THE STARS THROUGH THE TREES
THOSE AT ANY RATE WERE NOT IN THE DEPTFORD HE KNEW
HE HAD ENTERED TALBOT COURT OPENED A PANEL AND FOUND THAT OLD LETTER THAT TOLD OF DICKIE'S BIRTH
DEATH CAME AMONG THE ARDENS AND THAT CHILD BECAME THE HEIR TO THE NAME AND THE LANDS OF ARDEN
I BEG YOUR PARDON YOU WOULDN'T MIND ME BURSTING IN IF YOU KNEW HOW VERY IMPORTANT THE TREASURE IS TO THE FORTUNES OF OUR HOUSE THE LAWYER LAUGHED
HE MADE FOR THE DOOR BELOW THAT WINDOW
IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT WITH THEM THAN IT WAS WITH THE GROWN-UPS TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT HE HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE DICKIE HE WAS NOW
IT WAS A MISERABLE MOMENT
IT'S GOT LOOSE SAID DICKIE TRYING TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE PERAMBULATOR
SO LONG OLD CHAP DICKIE REMEMBERED EVERY WORD OF THAT SPEECH AND HE KEPT THE TREASURE
I'D LIKE TO WONDER YOU AIN'T AFEARED I'M USED TO IT SAID DICKIE
ALL GREEN FIELDS
THERE WAS SCENTED SOAP THERE WAS A SPONGE AND A WARM FLUFFY TOWEL
IT WAS A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT AND DICKIE LOVED IT
IT'S LAVENDER TERRACE WHERE I LIVE HE ENDED--"LAVENDER TERRACE ROSEMARY STREET DEPTFORD I'M GOING THAT WAY MYSELF SAID THE MAN GETTING AWAY FROM THE WALL
BUT BY THE TIME THE MOON-SEEDS HAD GROWN AND FLOWERED AND SHED THEIR SEEDS IN THE CASTLE GARDEN THEY CEASED TO KNOW THIS AND TALKED OFTEN SADLY AND FONDLY OF DEAR COUSIN DICKIE WHO WAS DROWNED
ALL THE SAME THE LIGHT HAD GONE OUT OF EVERYTHING AND IT IS SMALL WONDER THAT WHEN HE GOT HOME AT LAST VERY TIRED INDEED TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AT DEPTFORD HE BURST INTO TEARS AS NURSE WAS UNDRESSING HIM
I QUITE GRANT YOU IT'S LOW
BUT THAT URTS WORSEN ANYTHINK WELL SAID MR BEALE YOU SING OUT WHEN YOU GET TIRED AND I'LL GIVE YER A RIDE OH LOOK SAID DICKIE--"THE FLOWERS THEY'RE ONLY WEEDS SAID BEALE
AND THE PEOPLE SHOVING AND CRUSHING TO GET OFF THE STEAMER LAUGHED WHEN HE SAID IT
REMEMBER OF WHAT BLOOD THOU ART
AIN'T SHE ARST YOU TO STAY AND BE ER LITTLE BOY YES SAID DICKIE
AND DICKIE HAD A SORT OF FEELING THAT PERHAPS LORD ARDEN MIGHT HAVE SEEN BY HIS FACE AS OLD BEALE HAD THAT HE WAS AN ARDEN
I WISH I AD A BIT OF FINE-GRAINED WOOD
HE BOWED IN A COURTLY MANNER AND SAID WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TO-DAY RICHARD LORD ARDEN HE'S NOT LORD ARDEN SAID EDRED
BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS AND AS HE LAY HE COULD SEE THE SHINING OF THE DEW AMONG THE GRASS BLADES OF THE LAWN
NO DEAR
DON'T YOU KNOW THE BOY WAS QUITE CONTEMPTUOUS WITH HIM FOR NOT KNOWING
A LITTLE SHY THE ARDENS FRIENDS TOLD EACH OTHER BUT WHAT FINE MANNERS
AND THAT PILLOWY BUNDLE ON THE SEAT THAT'S OUR CLOTHES
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE ME TO GO AWAY SHE SAID IRONICALLY
ONCE THEY WENT OVER TO TALBOT COURT AND SAW THE SECRET PLACE WHERE EDWARD TALBOT HAD HIDDEN HIS CONFESSION ABOUT HAVING STOLEN THE ARDEN BABY THREE GENERATIONS BEFORE
THERE'S A AYSTACK A BIT OUT OF THE TOWN IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
NO WONDER THEIR ELDERS SAID
I CAN'T EXPLAIN
WELL THEN NOT TO DECEIVE YOU MATE I BOUGHT EM WHAT WITH SAID DICKIE LIGHTNING QUICK
WE MIGHT GO TO THREE BOB A WEEK FOR THE ROOM I'D LIKE A OUSE WITH A GARDEN SAID DICKIE
NOT NOW MY LAMB SHE SAID
WHEN EDRED GOT BACK TO ARDEN CASTLE TEA WAS READY IN THE PARLOR AND DICKIE WAS RESTING IN A COMFORTABLE CHAIR
QUITE WITHOUT MEANING TO DO IT HE PULLED ON THE REINS
IT MOVED AND SHIFTED UNDER HIM TOOK SHAPE
THE STEADFAST DESIRE TO GET TO GRAVESEND TO FIND HIS FATHER HAD GIVEN WAY AT ANY RATE FOR THE MOMENT TO A BURNING ANXIETY ABOUT TINKLER AND THE WHITE STONE
SUPPOSE WE WORK THE MAGIC AND JUST ASK TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY FROM HERE SAID EDRED FIRMLY
I'LL TAKE THE BOX IN FULL DISCHARGE OF YOUR DEBT
NURSE
GOV'NER--MY LORD I MEAN
THE REDHEADED MAN AND THE WOMAN WERE TRIED AT THE ASSIZES AND PUNISHED
THE LOUNGING MAN LAUGHED
IF THE POLICE WERE SET TO FIND OUT WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS DOING
NEVER AN ARDEN OF THEM ALL OH MOULDIWARP DEAR MOULDIWARP DO HELP ME
CHAPTER IX KIDNAPPED AND NOW NEW CROSS SEEMED TO GO BACKWARDS AND VERY FAR AWAY ITS DIRTY STREETS ITS SORDID SHIFTS ITS CROWDS OF ANXIOUS UNHAPPY PEOPLE WHO NEVER HAD QUITE ENOUGH OF ANYTHING AND DICKIE'S HOME WAS IN A PLEASANT COTTAGE FROM WHOSE WINDOWS YOU COULD SEE GREAT GREEN ROLLING DOWNS AND THE SMOOTH SILVER AND BLUE OF THE SEA AND FROM WHOSE DOOR YOU STEPPED NOT ON TO FILTHY PAVEMENTS BUT ON TO A NEAT BRICK PATH LEADING BETWEEN BEDS GLOWING WITH FLOWERS
YOUR RATTLE YOUR MOON-SEEDS YOUR SEAL HE STARED AT HER
MOTHER YOU MAY TRUST ME NOT TO WASTE IT IT WAS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE TO DICKIE
GO BACK TO YER OLD TALBOTS AND BE THE NICE LADY'S LITTLE BOY WITH VELVET KICKSIES AND A CLEAN ANKY ONCE A WEEK
WHERE IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS SAID DICKIE
I CAN'T THINK OF NOTHING BUT BUILD A CHICKEN-HOUSE AND THEN DIG INSIDE OF IT
FOR QUITE CERTAINLY AND MOST ODDLY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THE DOOR WAS AND WHEN HE HAD CREPT TO IT AND GOT IT OPEN HE FOUND THAT HE NOW KNEW QUITE WELL WHICH WAY TO TURN AND WHAT PASSAGES TO GO ALONG TO GET TO THAT LITTLE SIDE-DOOR THAT HE WAS TO OPEN FOR THE THREE MEN
AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD IF YOU WILL
TO ASK A CHAP TO DO A NOBLE DEED AND IN THE SAME BREATH TO TELL HIM HE IS A COWARD
AND WEEKS WENT BY AND STILL HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HAD NOT COME AND HE HAD LEARNED A LITTLE GREEK AND MORE LATIN COULD CARVE A BOX WITH THE ARMS OF HIS HOUSE ON THE LID AND MAKE THAT LID FIT
AND THE PEOPLE PRAISED HIS MODESTY
NEVER MIND SAID ELFRIDA IN COMFORTING TONES
IN HIS HEART HE LONGED FOR THAT PLEASANT HOUSE WHERE HE WAS THE YOUNG MASTER AND WAS NOT LAME ANY MORE
MORE THAN ONCE ON THE STAIRCASE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A STAIR CREAK BEHIND HIM AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AS HE WENT ALONG THE ROAD HE FANCIED HE HEARD A SOFT FOOTSTEP PAD-PADDING BEHIND HIM BUT OF COURSE WHEN HE LOOKED ROUND HE COULD SEE NO ONE WAS THERE
GOOD-BYE EDRED OLD CHAP
THE PRAM'S DRY AS A BONE AND SHINY AS YER AT AND WE'LL START THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EARLY MORNING WHICH IS FRESH AND SWEET EVEN IN DEPTFORD THEY BADE FAREWELL TO AMELIA AND THE DOGS AND SET OUT
THERE WAS WHISPERING GOING ON
AN THEN YOU OOFS IT A BIT AND RESTIES A BIT AND SOME ONE GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO ELP YOU ALONG THE ROAD AND IN THE EVENING YOU AS A GLASS OF ALE AT THE PUBLY KOWS AND FINDS ANOTHER SET O GREEN BED CURTAINS
PATS YOU ON THE NAPPER SHE DOES AND OUT WITH ARF A DOLLAR
BUT MR BEALE GOT IN AT THE BACK-DOOR AND OUT AT THE FRONT JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE DACHSHUND DISAPPEARING AT FULL SPEED LIKE A BIT OF BROWN TOFFEE-STICK AS HE SAID ROUND THE END OF THE STREET
AND MUSK--FORGET NOT MUSK--A STRONG THING AGAINST CONTAGION
I'D RATHER WAIT HERE IN CASE ANYBODY ELSE WAS TO TAKE THE HOUSE
MANY'S THE BOY WOULD AVE DONE A BUNK AND TOOK THE SHINERS ALONG WITH HIM
WE CALL HIM ROSINANTE SAID HIS FATHER BECAUSE HE IS SO FAT AND HE LAUGHED BUT DICKIE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE JOKE
HE DID NOT KNOW--BUT I KNOW
BUT WITH BROOMS AND LANTERNS AND MUCH SNEEZING AND CHOKING THE WHOLE PARTY GOT THROUGH TO THE DOOR OF THE TREASURE ROOM
THEY WENT TOGETHER INTO THE GARDEN
AGAIN HE LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY AT THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT SWEETBRIER BUT THE DOG SHOWED NO UNEASINESS SO EDRED KNEW THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW DICKIE WOULD HAVE MANAGED IF DESTINY HAD NOT KINDLY COME TO HIS HELP AND ARRANGED THAT TURNING A CORNER IN THE LANE WHICH LEADS TO THE VILLAGE HE SHOULD COME FACE TO FACE WITH EDRED AND ELFRIDA ARDEN
IT'S DIFFERENT ERE
THE TIRED EYES THAT MUST CLOSE THE FEELING THAT THROUGH HIS CLOSED EYELIDS HE COULD YET SEE SOMETHING MOVING IN THE CENTRE OF THE STAR THAT THE TWO TRIANGLES MADE
THE CHILD HATH FORGOT IN HIS FEVER ALL THAT EVER HE LEARNED OF ME HE COMPLAINED TO THE OLD NURSE WHO NODDED WISELY AND SAID HE WOULD SOON LEARN ALL AFRESH
YOU DIDN'T PINCH IT NO--ON MY SACRED SAM I DIDN'T SAID BEALE EAGERLY
HE STOOD UP AND TRUE WENT ON
WE'LL GO BACK BY THE BOAT IF YOU LIKE
AND BEALE WAS NOT HIS EQUAL EITHER IN THE GRACES OF THE BODY OR IN THE INNER TREASURES OF MIND AND HEART
AND BESIDES THERE WERE ALWAYS SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS TO DO AT THE COTTAGE
A DARK BUSH DIVIDED ITSELF INTO TWO PARTS AND ONE PART CAME SURPRISINGLY TOWARDS THEM
08
08
IT IS NOT IN THE NATURE OF ANY CHILD TO BROOD CONTINUALLY ON THE PAST OR THE FUTURE
PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE HE KNEW SHE WOULD NOT
KNOWS MORE TRICKS THAN THAT ERE I'LL BE BOUND HE DID
THEY ARE THINE OWN TO THEE TO SPEND AS THOU WILT NOT UNWISELY SAID THE MOTHER GENTLY
FORGET IT
FORGET IT
THINK YOU CAN STICK IT
WHAT YOU OPEN THAT DOOR AT ALL FOR MR BEALE ASKED AMELIA
WHEN THEY WERE ALL THERE SITTING ON THE SMOOTH SAND BY THE UNDERGROUND STREAM DICKIE SAID LOOK HERE
SEE THAT BLOKE JUST NOW SAID MR BEALE
AND THEN THEY REMINDED EACH OTHER HOW THEY HAD MET IN THE MAGIC OR DREAM WORLD AND HOW DICKIE HAD HELPED THEM TO SAVE THEIR FATHER--WHICH HE DID DO ONLY I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT
NO SAID DICKIE TURNING AWAY HIS HEAD
WHY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE
THEN THE BROWN SPANIEL BECAME AWARE OF TRUE AND BARKED AND THE OLD MAN SAID DOWN TRUSTY IN HIS SLEEP AND THEN WOKE UP
AND LORD ARDEN BOUGHT HIM A PONY SO THAT HIS LAME FOOT WAS HARDLY ANY DRAG AT ALL
BUT HE GOT TO THE LITTLE SIDE-DOOR AND FEELING WITH SENSITIVE QUICK FINGERS FOUND THE WELL-OILED BOLT AND SHOT IT BACK
TRUE WAS PRAISED MUCH BUT EDRED MORE
I'LL PLAY ALONG O THEM KIDS IF LORD ARDEN'LL LET ME
IT CAME OUT OF A SEAL HE SAID AND I DON'T MIND MAKING YOU A PRESENT OF IT OH SAID DICKIE YOU ARE A REAL RIGHTERN AND HE RESTED HIS CRUTCH AGAINST THE COUNTER EXPRESSLY TO CLASP HIS HANDS IN ECSTASY AS BOYS IN BOOKS DID
FOR FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE KNIFE TOUCHED THE WOOD DICKIE KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN AND THAT WHAT HE HAD DONE IN THE DEPTFORD DOCKYARD UNDER THE EYES OF SEBASTIAN THE SHIPWRIGHT WHO HAD HELPED TO SINK THE ARMADA HE COULD DO NOW ALONE IN THE WOODS BEYOND GRAVESEND
BUT IF YOU COME TO THINK OF IT SOMETHING HORRID HAPPENED TO US EVERY SINGLE TIME WE WENT INTO THE PAST WITH OUR MAGIC
I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN
IT LIES SAID THE NURSE AMONG THE PLEASANT FIELDS AND ORCHARDS OF DEPTFORD AND HOW HE DICKIE HAD BEEN VERY SICK OF THE PESTILENTIAL FEVER BUT WAS NOW THANKS TO THE BLESSING AND TO THE MINISTRATIONS OF GOOD DR CAREY ON THE HIGHROAD TO HEALTH
YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE HE HAD LEARNED THE ADDRESS ON THE CARD BY HEART
I WISH YOU'D REALLY BEEN MY MOTHER HE SAID AND HIS THOUGHTS WERE BACK IN THE OTHER DAYS WITH THE MOTHER WHO WORE A RUFF AND HOOP
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE ERE IF I WAS YOU AFTER LAST NIGHT
IT WAS REALLY RATHER A BIG HORSE
ALSO A FLOCK MATTRESS AND PILLOWS OF A DULL DUST COLOR TO GO ON THE BED AND SOME BLANKETS AND SHEETS ALL MATCHING THE MATTRESS TO A SHADE
GOOD OLD DAD HE WALKED QUICKLY ON AND DICKIE WAS LEFT STANDING BY THE GATE
ONLY I KNOW THAT EVERY ONE YOU KNOW KNOWS LOTS OF THINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THEY KNOW
LIE STILL AND THINK OF HIM THAT WAS GOOD TO THEE HE LAY THERE VERY STILL
IT STOOD UP BEAUTIFUL AND STATELY AND TURNED ITS CREAM-WHITE FACE TOWARDS THE SUN
THEN ONE OF THE BLANKETS WAS NAILED UP OVER THE TOP-FLOOR WINDOW AND ON THE IRON BEDSTEAD'S DINGY MATTRESS THE RESIN WAS MELTED FROM THE LID OF THE POT THAT MR BEALE HAD BROUGHT IN WITH THE OTHER THINGS FROM THE GARDEN
THE SWANS FLEW FAR TOO FAST FOR THE CHILDREN TO SEE WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHEN THE SWANS BEGAN TO FLAP MORE SLOWLY SO THAT THE CHILDREN COULD HAVE SEEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING TO SEE THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE SEEN BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE DARK
YOU'RE STRONGER THAN I AM SAID THE SECOND
DICKIE KNEW THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HIM BUT HE DID NOT MIND
NO--SHE WANTED THAT
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS HAVING MONEY THAT YOU'VE EARNED YOURSELF I OUGHT TO SHE SAID
HIS OWN SON IS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT AND NAUGHT BUT THE ROD TO BLAME FOR IT I VERILY BELIEVE THEY FOUND THE LADY-MOTHER AND HER BABE BY A LITTLE FIRE IN A WIDE HEARTH
FARVER YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A DAWG WELL YOU'VE A-GOT YER WANT NOW THREE TIMES OVER YOU AVE SAID BEALE AND UNBUTTONING HIS JACKET TOOK OUT A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF SOFT FLUFFY SPRAWLING ARMS AND LEGS AND HEADS AND TAILS--THREE LITTLE FAT WHITE PUPPIES
BUT I CAN STICK IT IF YOU CAN DICKIE COULD
AND PRESENTLY HE MADE WITH TRIPLE LINES OF SILVERY SEEDS A SIX-POINTED STAR SOMETHING LIKE THIS ILLUSTRATION ^ ^ ^ V WITH THE RATTLE AND THE SEAL IN THE MIDDLE AND THE LIGHT FROM THE STREET LAMP SHONE BRIGHTLY ON IT ALL
I DON'T DECEIVE YOU
AND IN THE MORNING THE BIRDS WAKE YOU AND YOU CURL DOWN WARM AMONG THE HAY AND LOOK UP AT THE SKY THAT IS GROWING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER AND BREATHE THE CHILL SWEET AIR AND GO TO SLEEP AGAIN WONDERING HOW YOU HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO LIE OF NIGHTS IN ONE OF THOSE SHUT-UP BOXES WITH HOLES IN THEM WHICH WE CALL HOUSES
HE SPREAD A SHEET OF IT OUT KNEELED BY IT AND SHOOK THE MOONFLOWER HEAD OVER IT
ONLY ALL THE DRESSES WERE WHITE
WHEN YOU'RE A-RIDIN IN YER CARRIAGE AN PAIR P'RAPS YOU'LL TAKE ME ON TER BE YER FOOTMAN WHEN I AM I WILL SAID DICKIE QUITE SERIOUSLY
IT WAS BRASSY WITH A WHITE STONE AND SOME SORT OF PATTERN ON IT
HERE HELP ME TO GET THESE THINGS OFF BUT WHAT DID IT SAY ELFRIDA ASKED HELPFULLY
SO LONG--SEE YOU AGAIN SOME DAY
AND YOU WILL NEED ALL YOUR COURAGE
EH SAID BEALE WITH MISERABLE ANGRY EYES
HIS HANDS FOUND THE SOFT BUNDLE OF RAGS THAT HE KNEW HELD TINKLER AND THE SEAL
PERHAPS HE'LL DO SOME MORE TO THE GARDEN TO-DAY HE SAID AND GOT UP VERY QUICKLY
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN DESCRIBE IT BETTER THAN BY SAYING THAT HE LOOKED AT ALL THESE THINGS WITH A DOUBLE PLEASURE--THE PLEASURE OF LOOKING AT NEW AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND THE PLEASURE OF SEEING AGAIN THINGS OLD AND BEAUTIFUL WHICH HE HAD NOT SEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME
AN MIND YOU CALL ME FATHER YUSS SAID DICKIE EXAGGERATING HIS LAMENESS IN THE MOST SPIRITED WAY
AND PRESENTLY HE SAID YOU ONCE SAW THE TREASURE BEING CARRIED TO THE SECRET ROOM--IN A PICTURE DIDN'T YOU THEY TOLD HIM YES
FROM THE MOMENT HE OWNED HIMSELF AN ENGINEER EDRED AND ELFRIDA GAVE HIM NO PEACE AND HE SEEMED QUITE PLEASED TO BE TAKEN TO SEE THE CAVES
WHY I SET OUT TO MAKE A BLIGHTED BURGLAR OF IM--YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE AND OUT THE WHOLE STORY CAME AS LORD ARDEN AND HE WENT ALONG THE GRAY ROAD LOOKING TO RIGHT AND LEFT WHERE NO BUSHES WERE NOR STONES ONLY THE SMOOTH CURVES OF THE DOWN SO THAT IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT NO LITTLE BOY WAS THERE EITHER
HE SAW THE MEN HE LOVED SPENDING THEIR BLOOD LIKE WATER TO DEFEND THAT HOUSE
IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO ONE HAD TOLD HIM
WHEN SHE GREW TO KNOW HIM BETTER AND FOUND OUT WHERE HE HAD LEARNED TO TALK LIKE THAT SHE PRODUCED MORE BOOKS
I'LL GET THE COLD CHISEL HE GOT IT AND WHEN HE CAME BACK DICKIE WAS ON HIS KNEES BY THE WALL AND HE HAD DUG WITH HIS HANDS AND UNCOVERED THE STONE WHERE HE HAD SCRATCHED WITH THE NAILS
TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL LAY ON THE FLOOR AMONG WHITE MOONFLOWER SEEDS CONFUSEDLY SCATTERED AND THE GAS LAMP FROM THE STREET SHONE THROUGH THE DIRTY PANES ON THE NEWSPAPERS AND SACKING
NO ONE WAS IN A HURRY AND THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER HOUSE WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE
ONLY JUST AT THE END IT TURNED INTO SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
TO THE LITTLE TRAMP THE WHOLE THING WAS A NEW AND ENTRANCING GAME OF MAKE-BELIEVE
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'LL BE ANY MORE GOOD THAN YOURS ELFRIDA FROWNED FIERCELY AND THE FEATHERS ON HER INDIAN HEAD-DRESS QUIVERED WITH THE INTENSITY OF HER EFFORT
NEXT MOMENT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS IN THE OLD SMUGGLERS CAVE THAT HE AND ELFRIDA HAD SO OFTEN TRIED TO FIND
WHEN HE WENT BACK THE OLD MAN WAS COOKING STEAK OVER THE KITCHEN FIRE AND BEALE WAS AT THE SINK STRAINING SUMMER CABBAGE IN A COLANDER AS THOUGH HE HAD LIVED THERE ALL HIS LIFE AND NEVER ANYWHERE ELSE
TIS MANY A DAY SINCE THOU HADST THE HEART TO HE REACHED THE GOLD KNOB OF HIS CANE TO DICKIE'S NOSE AND DICKIE WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT SMELLED SWEET AND STRONG SOMETHING LIKE GROCERS SHOPS AND SOMETHING LIKE A CHEMIST'S
I LEARNED TO TALK FINE OUT O BOOKS MR BEALE SAID NOTHING BUT THAT NIGHT HE ACTUALLY READ FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES IN A BOUND VOLUME OF THE WESLEYAN MAGAZINE
AND THE MAN NEXT DOOR PROMISED TWO MORE PENNIES LATER FOR REAL SEED
DICKIE SHE SAID HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY HERE AND BE MY LITTLE BOY I'D LIKE IT RIGHT ENOUGH SAID HE ONLY I GOT TO GO BACK TO FATHER BUT IF FATHER SAYS YOU MAY E WON'T SAID DICKIE WITH CERTAINTY AN BESIDES THERE'S TINKLER WELL YOU'RE TO STAY HERE AND BE MY LITTLE BOY TILL WE FIND OUT WHERE FATHER IS
IT'S NOT FAIR OH TELL HIM AND HAVE DONE SAID THE VOICE THAT HAD BEGUN ALL THE MAGIC AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE SLID ALONG THE WAINSCOT OF THE CORRIDOR AND VANISHED QUITE SUDDENLY JUST AS A CANDLE FLAME DOES WHEN YOU BLOW THE CANDLE OUT
WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE WERE DIGGING ABOUT TRYING TO FIND THE TREASURE
WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF WHITE MAGIC
FOR SO HE ESTEEMED THE LORDSHIP OF ARDEN AND THE OLD LANDS AND THE OLD CASTLE
HE FELL ASLEEP AMONG THE STRAW FINGERING THE CLASP-KNIFE IN HIS POCKET AND THINKING HOW SMARTLY HE WOULD CUT THE STRING WHEN THE TIME CAME
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANY ONE TILL IT'S OVER OH JUST AS YOU LIKE SAID ELFRIDA
THEY MADE A NEW WORLD FOR DICKIE
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME SAID DICKIE FIRMLY
THE LADY WASHED HIM WITH SWEET-SMELLING WATER IN A BIG BASIN WITH BLUE AND GOLD FLOWERS ON IT DRESSED HIM IN A LACE-TRIMMED NIGHTGOWN WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HER OWN FOR IT WAS MUCH TOO BIG FOR ANY LITTLE BOY
SO HE KEPT STEADILY ON AND TOOK NO NOTICE AT ALL OF A BLACK PATCH BY THE SWEETBRIER BUSH BY BEALE'S COTTAGE DOOR JUST EXACTLY AS IF SOME ONE WAS CROUCHING IN THE SHADOW
I COULD MAKE ANOTHER BOX
I GIVE THE ROUNDHEAD DOGS ANOTHER HOUR TO BREAK DOWN OUR LAST DEFENSE
AND HE FOUND ONE
WE'LL TAKE THE ROAD AND IF KIND PEOPLE GIVES US A HELPING HAND WELL SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR ALL PARTIES IF WOT THEY LEARNED ME AT SUNDAY-SCHOOL'S ANY GOOD
OF A PLACE WHERE HE BELONGED WHERE HE LOVED AND WAS LOVED
WELL THEN SAID ELFRIDA SLOWLY WE ARE
COME JOG THAT POOR PEAKED REMEMBRANCE DICKIE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THE BEAUTIFUL HOPE THAT WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
IT IS THE GRANDSON OF THAT KIDNAPPED HEIR WHO IS LORD ARDEN
AND THERE WAS THE MARK--19
I'D LIKE TO TRY
IT'S ALL SPOILED
ELSE HOW IS IT THAT ANY BOY WORTH HIS SALT WILL LEAVE THE NEWEST AND BRIGHTEST TOYS TO FOLLOW A CARPENTER OR A PLUMBER ROUND THE HOUSE FIDDLE WITH HIS TOOLS ASK HIM A THOUSAND QUESTIONS AND WATCH HIM PLY HIS TRADE
WHAT YOU SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT DICKIE SAID
IT IS NOT AN EASY THING TO WALK INTO THE COURTYARD OF A RUINED CASTLE AND RING THE BELL OF A STRANGE HOUSE AND ASK FOR PEOPLE WHOM YOU HAVE ONLY MET IN DREAMS OR AS GOOD AS DREAMS
OH WELL--ALL'S WELL AS HAS NO TURNING
THE TUTOR GAVE HIM A LITTLE PUSH SO THAT HE HAD TO GO FORWARD TWO STEPS AND TO STAND ALONE ON THE BEST CARPET WHICH HAD BEEN SPREAD IN THEIR HONOR AND HISSED IN A SAVAGE WHISPER RECITE YOUR SONG OF WELCOME HAPPY THE MAN BEGAN DICKIE IN TONES OF GLOOM AND TREMBLINGLY PRONOUNCED THE FIRST LINES OF THAT UNPLEASING POEM
SO HE PULLED AT THE CHAIN
THANK YOU THANK YOU--I WILL COME BACK NEXT MONTH AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING I HAVE LEARNED FROM THE PERRU SAL OF YOUR BOOKS PERUSAL SAID THE PAWNBROKER--"THAT'S THE WAY TO PERNOUNCE IT
SUPPOSE HE WENT AWAY TO THAT SURE RETREAT THAT WAS STILL LEFT HIM--THE PAST
SURE'S I'M ALIVE YOU BE THE MOLE ANSWERED
AIN'T URT YERSELF AVE YER HE SAID--FOR IN ALL THEIR WANDERINGS THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS DICKIE HAD SHED
THEY WERE IN FACT CONVOLVULUSES LITTLE PINK ONES WITH THEIR TENDRILS AND LEAVES LAID FLAT TO THE DRY EARTH BY THE WAYSIDE AND IN A WATER-MEADOW BELOW THE ROAD LEVEL BIG WHITE ONES TWINING AMONG THICK-GROWING OSIERS AND WILLOWS
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WERE THERE WAITING MADE ALL THE ORDINARY THINGS MORE BEAUTIFUL AND MORE INTERESTING
THAT DULL THUDDING SOUND CAME AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A GREAT CRASH AND A GREAT SHOUTING
I DREAMED I COULD CARVE WOOD--MAKE BOXES AND THINGS
THAT'S WHERE THE LODGING-HOUSE IS WHERE BEALE IS WAITING FOR YOU--THE MAN YOU CALLED FATHER
AND AGAIN THE LITTLE NIPPER
BUT HIS JUMP ENDED IN A SICKENING SIDEWAYS FALL AND HIS HEAD KNOCKED AGAINST THE WAINSCOT
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU HE SAID AND AS WELL NOW AS LATER
THE GREEK AND THE LATIN STAYED LEARNED RIGHT ENOUGH AND SANG IN HIS BRAIN ENCOURAGINGLY
THEN THE LADY WRAPPED FLANNEL AROUND THE HAIRY PART OF THE BROOM AND SEWED BLACK VELVET OVER THAT
THE KING HADN'T BEEN FAIR TO THE CATHOLICS YOU KNOW SAID ELFRIDA WHO EVIDENTLY KNEW ALL ABOUT THE MATTER SO A LOT OF THEM DECIDED TO KILL HIM AND THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
THEN EDRED SAID AHA IN A TONE OF TRIUMPH
OH EDWARD QUICK--HERE'S ONE OF THEM
HE LONGED TO SEE IT UNPACK ITSELF AND DISPLAY ITS WONDERS AND HE FOLLOWED IT THROUGH MORE STREETS THAN HE KNEW
OH DON'T MAKE IT ANY HARDER
IT'S THE SAME LAD MISTER HE SAID
GO ON WITH YOU SAID THE NEW MRS BEALE
BUT YOU CAN'T
IT HANGS TO THE BOOK LEARNING
IF THIS IS A DREAM IT'S A BETTER DREAM THAN THE OTHER
AND WHEN HIS AUNT SOLD THE POOR REMAINS OF THE HUTCH TO A MAN WITH A BARROW WHO WAS READY TO BUY ANYTHING AND WHO TOOK ALSO THE PAILS AND THE SHOVELS GIVING THREEPENCE FOR THE LOT DICKIE WAS ALMOST AS UNHAPPY AS THOUGH THE HUTCH HAD REALLY HELD A FURRY FRIEND
OWNED HE HAD FORGOT
AFTER THAT IT WAS LOOK ERE YOU NIPPER I AIN'T A-GOIN TO STAND IN YOUR LIGHT
AND SO MANY WINDOWS LOOKED OUT ON THE GARDEN
A DAWG THERE WON'T BE NO DAWG
COME KEEP YOUR HEART UP
MR BEALE BEGGED OF ALL LIKELY FOOT-PASSENGERS BUT HE NOTED THAT THE NIPPER NO LONGER STUCK IT ON FOR THE MOST PART HE WAS QUITE SILENT
THIS IS PART OF THE DISMAL MAGIC OF PAWN-TICKETS WHICH SOME GROWN-UP WILL KINDLY EXPLAIN TO YOU I CAN'T GET MONEY BY THE SWEAT OF MY BROW SAID DICKIE TO HIMSELF
I WOULD LIKE TO TRY OFF IS POOR CHUMP BEALE MURMURED WITH BITTER SELF-REPROACH
DICKIE WAS VERY HAPPY
I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT
AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE CROOKED
IN THE OLD NEW CROSS DAYS HE HAD NOT LIKED TO LOOK AT HIS FEET
WELL YOU ARE A PAL AND NO ERROR HE SAID
WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A MIST OF HORRIBLE THINGS
BUT YOU STUCK TO OLD BEALE AND HE'LL STICK TO YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID DICKIE BEGINNING TO PUT THE BRIGHT COINS BACK INTO THE BAG
I SEE NO REASON WHY GUNPOWDER TREASON SHOULD EVER BE FORGOT HOW ODD HE THOUGHT
TRY SAID SHE VERY EARNESTLY
STICK TO IT
THEY CARRIED HIM QUITE WITHOUT MISTAKE TO THE BLACKSMITH'S AT THE VILLAGE ON THE HILL--TO THE CENTRE OF THE MAZE OF CLIPPED HEDGES THAT WAS THE CENTRE OF THE GARDEN AND BEST OF ALL THEY CARRIED HIM TO THE DOCKYARD
HE TRIED ANOTHER
NOT SO SAID THE NURSE SMILING BETWEEN HER WHITE CAP FRILLS
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
DICKIE DISPLAYED IT PARTED WITH IT AND CAME HOME NURSING A PAPER BAG FULL OF RUSTLING PROMISES
DICKIE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH THE PINK ONES AND MR BEALE LET HIM
FARVER I DO SO WANTER SLEEP IN THAT OUSE THAT WAS WHERE I AD THE DREAM YOU KNOW OH WELL--COME ON THEN SAID BEALE
THE STOPPED-CLOCK FEELING WAS GROWING SO STRONG
ALL HE CARED FOR WAS TO FIND A FRIEND WHO WOULD HELP HIM
THEY'RE SEVEN MONTHS AHEAD OF YOU IN YOUR OWN TIME BUT SAID DICKIE VERY MUCH BEWILDERED AS I AM MYSELF AND AS I AM AFRAID YOU TOO MUST BE IF THEY'RE SEVEN MONTHS AHEAD WON'T THEY ALWAYS BE SEVEN MONTHS AHEAD ODDS BODIKINS SAID THE NURSE IMPATIENTLY HOW OFTEN AM I TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TIME
AN ENGLISHMAN'S OME IS IS CASTLE--AND WHAT WITH THE BOXES YOU'LL CUT OUT AND THE DOGS WHAT I'LL PICK UP BUCKINGHAM PALACE'LL LOOK SMALL ALONGSIDE OF US--EH MATEY THEY LOCKED UP THE HOUSE AND WENT TO BREAKFAST BEALE GAY AS A LARK AND DICKIE RATHER SILENT
I GIVE YER A RIDE IN A PLEASURE BOAT ONLY YOU WENT TO SLEEP AND I GIVE YOU A TEA FIT FOR A HEMPEROR
WE PAYS OUR OWN WAY
DICKIE WAS TAKEN FOR A DRIVE IN A LITTLE CARRIAGE DRAWN BY A CREAM-COLORED PONY WITH A LONG TAIL--A PERFECT DREAM OF A PONY AND THE LADY ALLOWED HIM TO HOLD THE REINS
IT WAS AFTER DINNER THAT MR BEALE BEGAN TO BE INTERESTED
ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT THE BELT WAS NOT ON HIM AND THAT HE WAS ALONE IN LONDON WITHOUT MONEY AND THAT AT GRAVESEND HIS FATHER WAS WAITING FOR HIM--WAITING WAITING
IF E'S UNDER THE DAISIES I SHAN'T LIKE IT--I TELL YOU STRAIGHT I SHAN'T LIKE IT
WHAT A CURIOUS DREAM SAID DICKIE
FORGET YOUR OLD NURSE--WHY YOU WILL TELL ME NEXT THAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOUR OWN NAME NO I HAVEN'T SAID DICKIE
TRY ANOTHER SAID DICKIE CALMLY
IT'S FELICIA M
THAT WAS GREAT FUN TOO
DICKIE EYED THE CHINA VASES AND CONCERTINAS AND TEASPOONS TIED TOGETHER IN FAN SHAPE AND WAITED SILENTLY
AND SHE TIPS ME A SMILE LIKE A HANGEL AND OLDS OUT ER HAND--IN ER WHITE GLOVE AND ALL--AND YER KNOW WHAT MY ANDS IS LIKE MATEY ILLUSTRATION
AN I'LL NEVER SPLIT ABOUT HIM SELLING THE VEGETABLES AND THINGS YOU'RE TOO SHARP TO LIVE MARKHAM DECLARED
A NECESSARY PART OF IT WAS THE DRESSING UP OF ELFRIDA IN BOY'S CLOTHES AND HER COMING OUT OF THE TOWER PRETENDING TO BE EDRED WHO WITH RICHARD HAD COME IN TO VISIT LORD ARDEN
I DON'T WANT TO GO UPSETTING OF PEOPLE
HE KNEW THEM ALL
MY DEAR FOOLISH BRAVE LAMB DICKIE WAS PULLING HIMSELF TOGETHER
THERE WERE NO CLOTHES THERE
HIS FATHER ASKED WHAT HE HAD LEARNED AND DICKIE TOLD DWELLING PERHAPS MORE ON THE RIDING AND THE FENCING AND THE BOWLS AND THE MUSIC THAN ON THE SOUR-FACED TUTOR'S SIDE OF THE BUSINESS
BUT MY EYES AIN'T SO GOOD AS WOT THEY WAS
HE POINTED OUT THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE SIMPLE DAM WOULD SEND THE WATER BACK INTO THE OLD CHANNEL
YOU SHOULD EAR IM AND SO FORTH AND SO ON TILL THE RED-WHISKERED MAN SAID QUITE CROSSLY SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE A BIT DOTTY ABOUT THIS ERE EXTRY DOUBLE NIPPER
YOU AREN'T VEXED BECAUSE I FORGET
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT HE REALLY ENJOYED BEING CLEAN
WE SHOULD LOOK NICE BRICKED UP IN A VAULT LIKE A WICKED NUN AND PERHAPS FORGOTTEN THE WAY TO GET OUT
WE WERE SAYING COULD IT BE YOU
THEY'LL DIE DIRECTLY HE SAID
THE MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIM THE WONDERFUL WORLD TO WHICH HE AWAKENS WHO HAS SLEPT IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS
HE WAS EXTREMELY ANNOYED BOTH WITH BEALE AND WITH DICKIE FOR MAKING SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM
KEEP IS MUG SHUT--THAT'S ALL HE'S CLEVER ENOUGH FOR HANYTHINK SAID BEALE AND CLOSE AS WAX
IT WAS IS DOING ME AND MELIA COME TOGETHER
I COULD KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR LIKELY PUPS SAID BEALE
AND YET WITHOUT HIS CRUTCH HOW ELSE WAS HE TO GET TO THAT BATH
AND MARKHAM LIFTED DICKIE TO THE WINDOW
HE AIN'T A BLOKE YOU'D KNOW--_'E'S IN ISTRY
IN YOU GETS HE SAID SUDDENLY
HE IS STRONGER THAN THE MOULDIWARP
YOU AND YOUR TANTRUMS DICKIE SAID WHAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO SAY AND GOT BACK TO THE GARDEN SHE SAYS SHE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO WASTE AN IF YOU AVE SHE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DOES WITH IT THERE'S A DIRTY MUG YOU'VE GOT ON YOU SAID THE MAN NEXT DOOR LEANING OVER TO GIVE DICKIE'S FACE A RUB WITH A HANDKERCHIEF HARDLY CLEANER
DON'T YOU COME SAUCING OF ME BUT WHICH IS THE WAY SAID DICKIE
AND LADY TALBOT--DICKIE WILL ALWAYS LOVE HER FOR THAT--UNDERSTOOD
I SEE THE ROOTS OF HIS BEING TAKING FAST HOLD OF HIS CHOSEN LIFE AND THE LIFE THAT HE RENOUNCED RECEDING RECEDING TILL HE CAN HARDLY SEE IT ANY MORE
DICKIE'S SNIFFS SUBSIDED
BUT I OUGHT TO BE GETTING OME
SHOCKING BATHING FATALITY THE NEWSPAPERS SAID
HAVE ANOTHER EGG BUT DICKIE'S PRIDE WAS HURT AND HE WOULDN'T
BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT I MADE IT SAID DICKIE AND PUT HIS LIPS TOGETHER VERY TIGHTLY
YOU MAY BE SURE HE MADE EVERY POSSIBLE HASTE TO GET BACK TO HIS COUSINS
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS HARDING'S HIS NAME SAID BEALE
MY DOIN TOO--PUTTIN IM ON TO A JOB LIKE TALBOT COURT THE NIPPER IS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AND GOT UP
MR BEALE
IT AIN'T MY WORK YOU'D BETTER SAID DICKIE OR THE LADY'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
WAS HE DICKIE HARDING WHO HAD LIVED AT NEW CROSS AND SOWN THE ARTISTIC PARROT SEED AND TAKEN THE OPEN ROAD WITH MR BEALE
THE SUN WAS QUITE DOWN BEFORE MR BEALE RETURNED
LORD ARDEN WILL BE SAFE ENOUGH
I'LL ASK SOME ONE WHO KNOWS
NOT ALF
WE CAN'T GET TO HIM SAID ELFRIDA
WHAT YOU SAY MATEY EH DICKIE LOOKED LOVINGLY AT THE SMART BACK OF THE LITTLE HOUSE--ITS CRISP WHITE MUSLIN BLINDS ITS GLIMPSES OF NEAT CURTAINS ITS FLOWERS
FOR THE DARK SOMETHING WAS DICKIE FAST ASLEEP
AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT YOU SHALL SHARE IN THIS GOOD FORTUNE
AN THE WATER'S GOOD
IT CAN'T BE A SPRING-CLEANING HE SAID BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG TIME OF YEAR NEVER SAY I DID NOT TELL THEE SHE ANSWERED UNFOLDING A GREAT EMBROIDERED CUPBOARD CLOTH AND HOLDING IT UP CRITICALLY
AND THEY WENT IN
FETCH FOOD AND BREAK IT ABOUT SAID THE MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE IN COMMAND THAT IT MAY LOOK AS THOUGH THE MEN HAD EATEN HERE
I'M GLAD I WASN'T BORN A TABLE TO BE WROTE ON
LET'S GET TO BED SHAN'T US MR BEALE DREAMED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO DROWN DICKIE IN A POND FULL OF STEWED EELS
I DO LIKE YOU HE SAID BUT I WANT FARVER WHERE IS HE
THE PAWNBROKER LOOKED AND EXCLAIMED AND QUESTIONED AND WONDERED AND DICKIE WENT AWAY WITH EIGHT SILVER SHILLINGS IN HIS POCKET THE FIRST COINS HE HAD EVER CARRIED IN HIS LIFE
SO HE LAY TOSSING ALL DAY HEARING THE BLACK MOLE OR SOMETHING ELSE SAY ALL THESE THINGS AND HIMSELF SAYING I MUST GO
COME ON OUT AND SHOW US WHERE YOU PUT IT
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME
EDRED SAID THAT IT WAS MOSTLY TRUE'S DOING
THE PLUMBER'S TOOLS
PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER CAN'T HELP MEETING AGAIN
IT WAS PLEASANT TO LIE AGAIN IN THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS
SURELY NOW HE COULD GIVE UP ONE BEAUTIFUL LIFE FOR ANOTHER--FOR THE SAKE OF THESE HIS FLESH AND BLOOD WHO HAD SO READILY SO KINDLY SO GENEROUSLY SET HIM IN THE PLACE THAT HAD BEEN THEIRS
THEN ONE NIGHT THE NURSE SAID I HAVE ASKED
HERE HUMPHREYS HE ADDED GIVE IT A RUB UP AND BRING THAT SEAL HERE THE PALE YOUNG MAN DID SOMETHING TO TINKLER WITH SOME PINKY POWDER AND A BRUSH AND A WASH-LEATHER WHILE HIS MASTER FITTED TOGETHER THE TWO HALVES OF A BROKEN WHITE CORNELIAN
THIS ERE'S WHERE WE GET OFF
WE AIN'T DONE SO MUCH WALKIN LATELY AVE US AIN'T TIRED IN YOURSELF ARE YOU MR BEALE ASKED CAUSE THERE'S A PLACE CALLED CHEVERING PARK PRETTY AS A PICTURE--I THOUGHT WE MIGHT LAY OUT THERE

WHERE HAD HE HEARD THAT OTHER VOICE
HE HAD NOT EVEN CARED TO THINK ABOUT HIS GARDEN AND WONDER WHETHER THE ARTISTIC BIRD SEEDS HAD COME UP PARROT-COLORED
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A NIPPER IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID DICKIE IN A HEARTBROKEN VOICE YOU'VE SPOILED EVERYTHING AND YOU LIE TO ME TOO
AND IF YOU GO TO HIS RESCUE YOU WILL BE TAKING FROM YOUR FATHER THE TITLE AND THE CASTLE AND YOU WILL BE GIVING UP YOUR PLACE AS HEIR OF ARDEN TO YOUR COUSIN RICHARD WHO IS THE RIGHTFUL HEIR BUT HOW IS HE THE RIGHTFUL HEIR EDRED ASKED BEWILDERED
THIS WHAT YOU WANT HE ASKED
PEOPLE DON'T GO TO THAT EXTREME IN NOTTINGHAM LACE WITHOUT THERE'S SOMETHING TO HIDE--A HOUSE FULL OF EMPTINESS MOST LIKELY INSIDE DICKIE WAS TELLING A VERY ASTONISHED MR BEALE THAT THERE WAS MONEY BURIED IN THE GARDEN
HE PULLED AGAIN AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE LANDING WINDOW
AND WHEN THEY GOT NEARLY TO HYTHE AND MET WITH THE RED-WHISKERED MAN WHO GOT UP SUDDENLY OUT OF THE HEDGE AND SAID HE'D BEEN HANGING OFF AND ON EXPECTING THEM FOR NIGH ON A WEEK MR BEALE SENT DICKIE INTO A FIELD TO LOOK FOR MUSHROOMS--WHICH DIDN'T GROW THERE--EXPRESSLY THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH THE RED-WHISKERED MAN--A CONVERSATION WHICH BEGAN THUS COULDN'T GET ERE AFORE
STEADY ON MATE
WOT'S THE BLOOMIN ROW NOW THE MAN NEXT DOOR SUDDENLY ASKED
THOU'LT HAVE TO LEARN TO RECKON BETTER THAN THAT IF THOU'ST TO BE MY PRENTICE

THEY ARE NOT SO BAD HE ADDED MORE WILLING TO PRIZE THEM NOW THAT THEY WERE HIS THINGS DO LOOK DIFFERENT WHEN THEY ARE YOUR OWN DON'T THEY HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE IN A JUG OF WATER TILL I GO HOME
I'VE THOUGHT IT ALL UP AND SETTLED IT ALL OUT
ANOTHER FOLLOWED IT--THAT WAS EDRED
AND NOW DICKIE LITERALLY DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS
ERE--CATCH OLD MR BEALE WAS SAYING AND THE RED-WHISKERED MAN TOOK DICKIE IN HIS ARMS AND WENT FORWARD
DON'T YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE ANY MORE NO SAID DICKIE IN BUSINESSLIKE TONES
TELL YOUR OLD FARVER THEN IT'S SILLY SOBBED DICKIE
HE HAD THE TREASURE AND HE HAD NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT IT WAS WITH ITS BELLS THAT JANGLED SUCH PRETTY MUSIC AND ITS WHITE SPIKE SO HARD AND SMOOTH
A BOY AT SCHOOL HAD HAD ONE
BLOW THE BEASTLY MATCH
BELIEVE ME YOU ARE NOT
IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO BURY TWENTY SOVEREIGNS AND TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE
HE FELT IN HIS POCKETS PULLED OUT TINKLER AND THE WHITE SEAL SET THEM ON THE FLOOR AND MOVED BY MEMORIES OF THE GREAT NIGHT WHEN HIS DREAM HAD COME TO HIM ARRANGED THE MOON-SEEDS ROUND THEM IN THE SAME PATTERN THAT THEY HAD LAIN IN ON THAT NIGHT OF NIGHTS
AND THE AIR WAS VERY COLD
THAT'S WHAT ANNUALS MEANS
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME
I WISH IT WAS LIKE THAT HERE WELL IT AIN'T SAID MR BEALE SHORTLY
I KNOW OW GOOD YOU ARE BLESS ME SAID MR BEALE UNCOMFORTABLY
SHOULDERS OF BROWN UPLAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OPEN SKY
VERY WELL THEN SHE SAID HEROICALLY I WON'T ASK YOU A SINGLE THING
HE WAS VERY
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT SAID EDRED COMPLACENTLY
NOW FOR IT
HE HAD AN ABSURD FANCY THAT HE COULD SEE THROUGH HIS CLOSED EYELIDS SOMETHING MOVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAR THAT THE TWO TRIANGLES MADE
I WILL TELL YOU
CHAPTER II BURGLARS DICKIE FELL ASLEEP BETWEEN CLEAN COARSE SHEETS IN A HARD NARROW BED FOR WHICH FOURPENCE HAD BEEN PAID
WHERE'D YOU LIKE TO BE BEALE ASKED ANXIOUSLY
ONE THING I SHAN'T BE BURGLED WITH ALL THEM DOGS IN THE HOUSE THE VOICES OF THE DOGS AS SHE WENT IN AND SHUT THE DOOR SEEMED TO ASSURE HER THAT SHE WOULD NOT EVEN BE SO VERY LONELY
TELL YER WHAT MATE--LOOKS TO ME AS IF I'D TOOK A FANCY TO YOU I AVE TO YOU I KNOW THAT SAID DICKIE SETTLING HIS CRUTCH FIRMLY AND PUTTING HIS HAND INTO MR BEALE'S
I DREAMED I AD A FEVER--AND--I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE
THE TRAINING HE HAD HAD IN THE OLD-WORLD LIFE ENABLED HIM TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND TO BE UNEMBARRASSED WITH THE ARDENS AND THEIR FRIENDS AS HE WAS WITH THE BEALES AND THEIRS
BUT I'M SURE IF THE MOULDIESTWARP HEARS IT HE WON'T CARE TUPPENCE WHETHER IT'S SWEAR OR SWORE
AND I WISH THAT IN A YEAR THEY MAY FORGET WHAT I HAVE DONE AND LET THEM NOT BE UNHAPPY ABOUT ME BECAUSE I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY
BUT I STARTED LEARNING A LOT OF THINGS--GAMES MOSTLY IN THE DREAM I DID--AND I STARTED MAKING A BOAT--A GALLEON THEY CALLED IT
AND SHE WILL TAKE THEM ALL
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT SILENCE WAS BEFORE--OR DARKNESS
I DUNNO SAID BEALE
I DUNNO SAID BEALE
BUT COME INTO THY PANELLED CHAMBER WHERE THY TUTOR CANNOT EAVESDROP AND BETRAY US AND HAVE THEE GIVEN OVER TO HIM WHOLLY AND ME BURNED FOR A WITCH THESE TERRIBLE WORDS KEPT DICKIE SILENT TILL HE AND THE NURSE WERE SAFE IN HIS ROOM AND THEN HE SAID COME WITH ME TO MY TIME NURSE--THEY DON'T BURN PEOPLE FOR WITCHES THERE NO SAID THE NURSE BUT THEY LET THEM LIVE SUCH LIVES IN THEIR UGLY TOWNS THAT MY LIFE HERE WITH ALL ITS RISKS IS FAR BETTER WORTH LIVING
THERE'S A PLENTY HERE AND THERE ALL ABOUT--AND YOU WITH YOUR BOXES
HE HAS DONE ALL THAT DICKIE WOULD HAVE DONE
AND HOW CAN ANY ONE ENJOY ANYTHING WHEN THIS SORT OF THING KEEPS ON SAYING ITSELF UNDER AND OVER AND THROUGH AND BETWEEN EVERYTHING HE SEES AND HEARS AND FEELS AND THINKS
A TRICK DOG E IS
HE LAY AND THOUGHT AND LOOKED AT THE RICH PLEASANT ROOM THE KIND CLEAR FACE OF THE NURSE THE GREEN GREEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES THE TAPESTRY AND THE RUSHES
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN THE CRIPPLED CHILD IN THE SHABBY CLOTHES STOOD UP AND INSTEAD OF TOUCHING HIS FOREHEAD AS POOR CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT TO DO HELD OUT HIS HAND AND SAID HOW DO YOU DO LORD ARDEN I AM VERY WELL I THANK YOU SAID LORD ARDEN
THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
SUPPOSEN THEY WAS TO NAB YOU--WHAT UD YOU SAY DICKIE WAS WATCHING HIS FACE CAREFULLY
IT'S ALL RIGHT LET'S FETCH FATHER SUGGESTED ELFRIDA
MY FATHER IS INDEED SAID THE MOULDIERWARP WITH AN AIR OF POLITE INTEREST
I THANK YOU ALL FROM MY HEART
NOW IS IT WELL THEN SAID DICKIE LET'S GET A MOVE ON US AH SAID MR BEALE LAYING HIS PIPE ON HIS KNEE NOW YOU'RE TALKIN GET A MOVE ON US
I AIN'T SAID I'LL BE IN ANYTHING YET AVE I
IT WAS THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COINED IN SOME FAIRY MINT
AND DICKIE BY CONSTANT PRACTICE GREW SO CLEVER AT TAKING HIS PART IN THE ACTING THAT MR BEALE WAS QUITE DAZED WITH ADMIRATION
AT ANY RATE HE COULD NEVER BE SURE AFTERWARDS WHETHER THERE REALLY HAD BEEN A VERY POLITE AND PLAUSIBLE BLACK MOLE SITTING ON HIS PILLOW MOST OF THE DAY SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH THE PART OF HIMSELF THAT HE LIKED LEAST AGREED WITH
MAY I CRUTCH THE FATHER REPEATED
DICKIE DIDN'T DREAM AT ALL
WHEREVER I'VE COME TO IT'S AN ADVENTURE HE TURNED BACK TO THE ROOM AND LOOKED FOR HIS CLOTHES
AND ARDEN WAS DICKIE'S OWN NAME TOO IN THIS OLD LIFE AND HIS FATHER WAS SIR RICHARD ARDEN OF DEPTFORD AND AYLESBURY
DICKIE FOLLOWED
THE LITTLE COUSINS WERE SO FRIENDLY AND JOLLY THE GROWN-UP PEOPLE SO KIND--EVERYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO CLEAN
WHEN HIS HANDS WERE FREE HE STOOD UP AND FELT FOR THE PINS THAT FASTEN THE THATCH
BECAUSE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS NURSE HOW LONG DID IT TAKE ME TO DREAM THAT DREAM ABOUT MAKING THE BOXES AND EARNING THE MONEY IN THE UGLY PLACE I TOLD YOU OF DREAMS ABOUT THAT PLACE SHE ANSWERED HIM TAKE NONE OF OUR TIME HERE
HERE WE ARE AGAIN SAID THAT TRADESMAN
HOFF WITH IT SAID THE MAN OBLIGINGLY
AN ON SATURDAY YOU GETS IN A EXTRA LOT OF PROG AND A SUNDAY YOU STAYS WHERE YOU BE AND WASHES OF YOUR SHIRT DO YOU HAVE ADVENTURES ASKED DICK RECOGNIZING IN THIS DESCRIPTION A ROUGH SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF A MODERN KNIGHT-ERRANT
SEEMS TO ME IT'S A REG'LAR ARDEN FACE HE'S GOT
FOUR OR FIVE WHAT MAN DEAR THE LADY ASKED AGAIN
SO DICKIE HAD A GOOD LOOK AT THE ROOM AND THE FURNITURE--IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING HE EVER REMEMBERED SEEING AND YET HE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HE HAD SEEN THEM BEFORE THESE HIGH-BACKED CHAIRS COVERED WITH FLOWERS LIKE ON CARPETS
AND IT COULDN'T BE SWEAR BECAUSE OF RHYMING ELFRIDA EXPLAINED
MILLAR NEW YORK FREDERICK A
I DON'T KNOW AS EVER I SLEP SO SOUND AFORE
WHICH WAY YOU GOIN DOWN HOME--GO PAST YOUR OLD SHOP
BUT THIS ERE BACK-YARD IT AIN'T A PLACE WHERE DOGS CAN WHAT YOU CALL EXERCISE NOT TO CALL IT EXERCISE
HE REWARD THE WAKE THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH AND I WUNNERED WHAT IT STOOD FOR IT STANDS FOR LAYING OUT SAID THE MAN AND SO IT DOES THOUGH THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT THE AUTHOR OF HEREWARD MEANT IT TO MEAN)--"LAYING OUT UNDER A EDGE OR A AYSTACK OR SUCH AND LOOKIN UP AT THE STARS TILL YOU GOES BY-BY
I NEVER SEEN HIM THOUGH
ALSO HE WAS NEAR ARDEN THE GOAL OF SEVEN MONTHS EFFORT
AND OF A HIGH TRUTH TOO
I WISH I'D GOT SOMETHING I COULD SELL HE LOOKED ROUND THE YARD--DIRTIER AND NASTIER THAN EVER NOW IN THE PARTS THAT THE MAN NEXT DOOR HAD NOT HAD TIME TO DIG
ALSO IT WAS MELTED FROM THE CRACK OF THE IRON CASKET
THERE WAS NO OTHER THING TO BE DONE
AND YOU'LL STAY
NEXT DAY AGAIN A LITTLE BOY WORKED ALONE IN A WOOD AND YET NOT ALONE FOR A SMALL PUP SPRAWLED AND YAPPED AND SCRAPPED AND GRUNTED ROUND HIM AS HE WORKED
EDRED LOOKED
BUT THE DOGS SEEMED WELL AND HAPPY THOUGH THEY WERE DOCTORED WITH HERB TEA INSTEAD OF STUFF FROM THE CHEMIST'S AND THE CHARMS THAT WERE SAID OVER THEM TO MAKE THEM SWIFT AND STRONG CERTAINLY DID NOT MAKE THEM ANY THE LESS STRONG AND SWIFT
SO YOU WANT TO PLEDGE THE SEAL
YOU OUGHT TO BE SIR
