BUT HE DIDN'T COMPLAIN
YOU SEE SHE KNEW THAT MR COON WAS BEGINNING A GOOD HABIT A VERY GOOD HABIT INDEED--THE HABIT OF NEATNESS
HE JUST HAD TO
MR SNAKE WOULD GO ABOUT ALL DAY CHEATING EVERYBODY HE MET
IF I DO THAT THOUGHT SHE IT WILL MAKE IT ALL THE EASIER FOR HIM TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT AND ALL THE HARDER FOR HIS NEIGHBORS TO KNOW WHEN HE IS ABOUT SO INSTEAD OF GIVING HIM THE PLAIN HOMELY SUIT THAT SHE HAD THOUGHT OF GIVING HIM SHE MADE HIS COAT OF BLUE BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE AND TRIMMED IT WITH THE WHITEST OF WHITE TRIMMINGS SO THAT MR JAY HAD ONE OF THE VERY HANDSOMEST COATS IN ALL THE GREEN FOREST
IF YOU WANT THE REST OF US TO HELP YOU YOU'D BETTER GET THINGS STARTED YOURSELF SAID OLD MR SKUNK CAREFULLY COMBING OUT HIS BIG PLUMY TAIL
IT WAS A VERY GREAT HONOR AND FOR A WHILE HE FELT IT SO AND DID HIS BEST TO RULE WISELY
OF COURSE THAT MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS AN A POWERFUL LOT OF SMOKE AN HOT ASHES FLY UP THE CHIMNEY
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY BUSY VERY BUSY INDEED AND IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS
HE FLEW AND HE FLEW AND HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP HOPE OF FINDING ANY SUCH PLACE WHEN HE SAW A CAVE
YES SIR I'M GLAD I DID IT AND I'M GLAD THAT NEIGHBOR MEADOW MOUSE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT
GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDED HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT AND HALF CLOSED HIS EYES AS IF LOOKING WAY WAY BACK INTO THE PAST
REDDY FOX IS VERY SPRY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY FRIGHTENING AN OLD FELLOW LIKE ME THIS WAY JUST TRYING TO GET EVEN WITH YOU FOR TRYING TO FOOL US INTO THINKING THAT YOU WERE ASLEEP WHEN YOU WERE WIDE AWAKE REPLIED PETER
I SHOULD THINK THAT SHE WOULD GIVE SUCH A THIEF AS SAMMY JAY THE VERY HOMELIEST SUIT SHE COULD FIND
I NEVER SEE HIM IN THE DAYTIME AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE KEEPS HIMSELF
WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE FOUND THAT MR JAY HAD PASSED ALONG HIS BAD HABITS TO HIS CHILDREN SHE PASSED ALONG HIS HANDSOME BLUE COAT TOO AND SO IT HAS BEEN FROM THAT LONG-AGO DAY RIGHT DOWN TO THIS
OF COURSE THERE MUST BE A REASON
CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG FOLDING HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT IF YOU WILL SIT STILL UNTIL I FINISH I'LL TELL YOU
BUT THEY DIDN'T
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO GRANDFATHER FROG WENT ON
I GUESS MR POSSUM WON'T PLAY ANY MORE JOKES MR PANTHER SAID HE
THIS WAS JUST OLD MOTHER NATURE'S VIEW OF THE MATTER
AS USUAL PETER RABBIT WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK
YOU SEE HE WAS SO BUSY MINDING OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ATTEND TO HIS OWN
YOU CAME OVER HERE JUST TO ASK ME FOR A STORY
GRANDFATHER FROG SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND LOOKED VERY HARD AT PETER
ONCE UPON A TIME LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERYTHING WONDERFUL HAPPENED LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED PETER
SO FROM THAT DAY TO THIS THE MUSKRATS HAVE BUILT THEIR HOUSES IN THE WATER AND HAVE BEEN AMONG THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS CONTENTED AND HAPPY OF ALL THE ANIMALS
I HAVEN'T TIME TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT NOW
THAT'S VERY GOOD PETER VERY GOOD INDEED
I SAW HIM AT WORK HERE THIS MORNING
BEING FAT AND NEVER HURRYING OR WORRYING MADE HIM GOOD-NATURED
SO HE USED TO STUDY AND PLAN HOW HE COULD OUTWIT THEM WITHOUT DANGER TO HIMSELF
IT WAS THIS
HE PRETENDED THAT ONE OF HIS LONG HIND-LEGS WAS LAME SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN ON THREE LEGS WHILE JOHNNY CHUCK COULD USE ALL FOUR
BUT NEVER ONCE DID MR GREENSNAKE WINK BACK
SO AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY THE NEXT DAY HE HURRIED OVER TO THE SMILING POOL TO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT IT
YES SIR OLD MR RABBIT WAS ALWAYS GETTING INTO TROUBLE
EVEN MR CHUCK GRUMBLED
IS IT IN THE BANK OR DOWN UNDER WATER IT IS JUST WHEREVER I HAPPEN TO BE
AND THAT WILL BE EASIER AND EVER SO MUCH SAFER AS WELL SO MR BEAVER BUILT A DAM AT JUST THE RIGHT PLACE WHILE ALL THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM FOR WORKING SO HARD
HIS EYES TWINKLED AS PETER AND JOHNNY VERY POLITELY WISHED HIM GOOD MORNING
HE DIDN'T LIKE TO WORK ANY MORE THAN PETER RABBIT DOES NOW
JOHNNY TRIED AGAIN AND STILL NO REPLY
IT HAPPENED ABOUT THIS TIME THAT HE OVERHEARD MR FOX TALKING TO MR WOLF WHEN THEY BOTH THOUGHT HIM ASLEEP
SO HE WENT TO WORK AND MADE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SQUEEZE INTO
THERE THEY FOUND GRANDFATHER FROG SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD JUST AS USUAL AND PETER KNEW BY THE LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES THAT GRANDFATHER FROG HAD A GOOD BREAKFAST OF FOOLISH GREEN FLIES TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
THAT WAS THE WAY WITH OLD MR RABBIT WHO LIVED A LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
BUT PETER HAD JUST HAD A NARROW ESCAPE A VERY NARROW ESCAPE FOR REDDY FOX HAD SPRUNG OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AS PETER CAME DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH AND HAD SO NEARLY CAUGHT PETER THAT HE HAD ACTUALLY PULLED SOME FUR OUT OF PETER'S COAT
CAN YOU GUESS WHAT IT IS
BY AND BY HE NOTICED THAT IT WAS GROWING DARK OUTSIDE
THE ADVENTURES OF OLD MR
MR COYOTE WAS ANOTHER WHOM IT MADE SLY AND CUNNING
BUT WHEN HE DID HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY UNTIL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THEIR ANGER
AFTER THAT MR MOLE SPENT ALL HIS TIME IN HIS TUNNELS AND SELDOM PUT HIS NOSE OUTSIDE
SOME OF THEM IT MADE VERY SLY AND CUNNING LIKE OLD MR FOX
OLD GRANNY FOX THE BURGESS BIRD BOOK FOR CHILDREN THE BURGESS ANIMAL BOOK FOR CHILDREN CONTENTS CHAPTER I
SO HE SHOOK HIS FEATHERS OUT HALF SPREAD HIS WINGS TO LET THE AIR BLOW UNDER THEM LOOKED DOWN AT ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE GATHERED ABOUT THE FOOT OF THE TALL DEAD TREE WHERE HE DELIGHTS TO ROOST GRINNED AT THEM IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AND THEN BEGAN THIS STORY
TO KEEP STILL AND WATCH HIM WAS ALMOST MORE THAN MR COYOTE COULD STAND FOR HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE SIDES OF HIS STOMACH ALMOST MET IT WAS SO EMPTY
BUT IN SPITE OF THIS HE DIDN'T BEGIN TO MAKE AS MUCH TROUBLE AS BEFORE
IT CERTAINLY IS LUCKY IF I WERE I WOULD GIVE YOU A HANDSOME COAT TOO GRANDFATHER FROG REPLIED PETER
PERHAPS HE IS TRULY SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE AND I WILL NOT HAVE TO PUNISH HIM MORE BUT IF MR JAY WAS TRULY SORRY HE GAVE NO SIGNS OF IT
BUT I CAN'T PROTESTED PETER
BECAUSE HIS GRANDPAP ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS REPLIED OL MISTAH BUZZARD SLYLY WINKING AT THE OTHERS
HAPPY JACK TURNED TO FIND OLD MR TOAD SITTING IN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
NO MATTER WHERE HE SIT HE CAN'T HEAR WHAT BEING SAID DOWN INSIDE THAT LIL OL TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE
EVERYTHING HE HEARD HE REMEMBERED SO THAT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE KNEW MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON THAN ALL HIS NEIGHBORS TOGETHER
MR COON WATCHED HER OUT OF SIGHT
PETER WONDERED IF HE MEANT HIM FOR YOU KNOW PETER IS A GREAT GOSSIP
WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO WASH MY FOOD IF I EAT IT OUT OF DIRTY HANDS SAID MR COON TO HIMSELF AND HE HURRIED TO A QUIET LITTLE POOL TO GIVE THEM A GOOD SCRUBBING
THEY FIND IT HARD VERY HARD INDEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY SUCH A SCAMP AND MISCHIEFMAKER AS SAMMY JAY SHOULD BE GIVEN SUCH A WONDERFUL BLUE COAT WITH WHITE TRIMMINGS
OH DEAR
OH DEAR
MR PANTHER DIDN'T DARE GO OUT THERE SO HE JUST SHOOK THE BRANCH
THE TIMES GREW HARDER AND HARDER UNTIL IT SEEMED AS IF OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD WHOLLY FORGOTTEN HER LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN MEADOWS AND THE GREEN FOREST

WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL XII
WHY DON'T YOU FOLD YOUR HANDS THE WAY I DO PETER RABBIT SHOUTED HAPPY JACK
THANK YOU CRIED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND STARTED OFF TO HUNT UP UNC BILLY POSSUM
IT LOOKED VERY BLACK INSIDE BUT IT WAS BIG ENOUGH FOR MR BAT TO FLY INTO AND IN HE WENT
HE WAS JUST AS QUICK MOVING AS THEY WERE
HE WAS A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BECAUSE HE HAD HAD TO USE HIS LONG LEGS AS FAST AS HE KNEW HOW BUT HE WAS SAFE
NOW MR TURTLE LIVING IN THE SMILING POOL HAD PLENTY TO EAT
IT WAS SUCH A SUCCESS THAT HE TAUGHT HIS CHILDREN HOW TO DO IT AND THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN AND SO ON DOWN TO UNC BILLY WHOM YOU KNOW
BUT PETER HAD SEEN THAT TWINKLE IN HIS EYES AND KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER FROG WAS FEELING GOOD-NATURED IN SPITE OF HIS GRUFF GREETING
NOW DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE FOR I WANT TO TAKE A NAP CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
THAT IS TO SAY HIS HEAD AND LEGS AND TAIL DISAPPEARED
PETER'S FACE SHOWED JUST HOW DISAPPOINTED HE FELT
YOU SEE PETER HAD ADMIRED BOBBY COON'S TAIL FOR A LONG TIME
GOOD MORNING SAID HE GRUFFLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE SAMMY JAY IS NOT WHOLLY TO BLAME FOR ALL HIS BAD HABITS
HE WENT AND CAME AS HE PLEASED AND ENJOYED THE SUNSHINE AND TOOK PART IN ALL THE GOOD TIMES OF HIS NEIGHBORS
BUT HE SOON FOUND THAT HE WAS NOT SAFE IN THE AIR IN DAYTIME
MR RABBIT WAS VERY FOND OF SITTING WITH FOLDED ARMS
SO EVER SINCE THAT LONG-AGO DAY WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG ALL TURTLES HAVE CARRIED THEIR HOUSES WITH THEM AND NEVER HAVE MEDDLED IN THINGS THAT DON'T CONCERN THEM CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
BETTER TIMES COMING
BETTER TIMES COMING
THE FIRST THING PETER LOOKED TO SEE WAS WHAT KIND OF A TAIL PADDY HAS OH IF YOU PLEASE
A MINUTE LATER PETER'S SHARP EYES SAW HIM PEEPING OUT FROM UNDER A LILY-PAD TO SEE WHAT HAD FRIGHTENED HIM SO
WHEN HE SAW THEM COMING HE REALIZED THAT WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT WAS A JOKE HAD BECOME NO LONGER A LAUGHING MATTER FOR HIM
MR MOLE WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR HIS NARROW ESCAPE AND IT SET HIM TO THINKING
EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN THE SMILING POOL KNOWS THAT IT IS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD ANYWAY GRANDFATHER FROG WINKED AT JERRY MUSKRAT WHO WAS LISTENING AND JERRY NODDED HIS HEAD
HE GREW MORE SLY AND CRAFTY THAN EVER
HE HELD HIS HEAD VERY HIGH IN THE AIR AND PRETENDED NOT TO CARE
HE WAS YOUNG AND SPRY AND SMART WAS MR SNAKE
NOW MR SKUNK WAS VERY SMART AND SHREWD OH VERY
THE ADVENTURES OF BOBBY COON 18
YOU'VE KEPT ME WAITING A LONG TIME PETER RABBIT
BUT MR COON DIDN'T GRUMBLE AND HE DIDN'T GO AWAY
IT DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE HE ADMITTED
OH CRIED MR COON AND THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE COULDN'T SAY ANOTHER WORD BUT JUST LOOKED AND LOOKED WITH SHINING EYES AND SUCH A QUEER FEELING OF HAPPINESS IN HIS HEART
FINALLY MR RABBIT HAD MADE THE ROUND OF ALL HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS AND HE ONCE MORE REACHED HIS TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE
WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED TELLING THEM HOW CHEATING AND STEALING AND LYING ISN'T SMART AT ALL BUT VERY VERY DREADFUL SHE TURNED TO MR SNAKE AND SAID
RIGHT REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
STRIPED CHIPMUNK MADE A FACE AT JOHNNY
BY AND BY HE JUST HAPPENED TO GLANCE AT HIS TAIL
PETER COULDN'T HELP WATCHING HIM
IT WAS IN THE WAY WHEN HE SAT DOWN
AT FIRST HE WAS ANNOYED AND STARTED TO SHAKE IT OFF
BUT SLY AND SPRY TIS VAIN TO TRY TO BE AS SLY AND SPRY AS I WHEN PETER RABBIT SHOUTED THIS REDDY LOOKED BACK AND SHOWED ALL HIS TEETH BUT PETER ONLY LAUGHED AND REDDY TROTTED ON
WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM XVI
HAVING NOTHING TO DO BUT EAT AND SLEEP HE GREW VERY FAT AND LAZY AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH HIM LEAVE HIM HERE AS A WARNING TO OTHERS GROWLED OLD KING BEAR
HE ALMOST PITIED BUSTER BEAR
THEN HE SIGHED
GRANDFATHER FROG SUDDENLY SWELLED OUT WITH INDIGNATION
OH HOW LOVELY
A GOOD HEART AND HONEST WAYS ARE BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES V WHY JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES OF OLD MOTHER WEST WIND HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM THE BIG BAG IN WHICH SHE CARRIES THEM EVERY NIGHT TO THEIR HOME BEHIND THE PURPLE HILLS AND EVERY MORNING BRINGS THEM BACK TO THE GREEN MEADOWS TO ROMP AND PLAY ALL DAY
OL MISTAH BUZZARD LOOKED DOWN AT UNC BILLY AND HE SAW A TWINKLE IN UNC BILLY'S SHREWD LITTLE EYES
IT WAS SO WITH MR COON
I DON'T KNOW HE CONFESSED FINALLY
SHE SAW THE NEW DAM AND THE NEW POND AND SHE ASKED MR BEAVER WHO HAD MADE THEM
OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS GREATLY PLEASED BUT SHE DIDN'T SAY SO
AT FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS REDDY FOX ONLY SOMEHOW IT LOOKED BIGGER
YES SIR IT STOOD RIGHT UP ON END HE WAS SO SCARED
HE FOUND THE AIR FULL OF INSECTS EVER SO MANY MORE THAN IN THE DAYTIME
BUT THESE SCRAPS NEVER WHOLLY SATISFIED HIM AND HIS MOUTH USED TO WATER AS HE WATCHED THE OTHERS FEAST ON THE VERY BEST WHEN THEY HAD HAD A SUCCESSFUL HUNT
I WOULD IF PETER RABBIT WERE HERE
IT IS A GREAT MISTAKE A VERY GREAT MISTAKE
WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE SAW THIS SHE CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT TAKING AWAY HIS HANDSOME SUIT
THE MORE STICKS HE ADDED THE BIGGER THE POOL GREW
MOTHER NATURE CALLED ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE FOREST AND THE MEADOWS TOGETHER
EVERY NIGHT HE CAME HOME EARLY AND WENT TO BED BY SUNDOWN AND EVERYBODY SAID WHAT GOOD HABITS MR FOX HAD
IT MEANS SIMPLY THAT OLD MAN COYOTE COMES OF A VERY SMART FAMILY AND THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE GIFT OF OLD MOTHER NATURE TO HIS GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED THIS SOUNDED SO MUCH LIKE A STORY THAT PETER STRAIGHTWAY TEASED GRANDFATHER FROG TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT
THE ADVENTURES OF SAMMY JAY 11
THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES RACED SO HARD THAT THEY WERE QUITE OUT OF BREATH WHEN THEY BURST THROUGH THE BULRUSHES AND SURROUNDED GRANDFATHER FROG AS HE SAT ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD
WHAT A QUEER WAY OF LIVING THOUGHT STRIPED CHIPMUNK
ONE DAY AS HE WAS HURRYING HOME TO DINNER HE CLIMBED UP ON AN OLD STUMP TO LOOK AROUND AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WAY WAS CLEAR
WHY NOT ASKED HAPPY JACK
IT WAS GREAT FUN
NOW MR WOODCHUCK WAS A WORKER AND VERY VERY NEAT
THEN WHAT DO YO THINK MISTAH BUZZARD DO
JUST IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED HE WAS WHEN HE COULDN'T MAKE SURE THAT BUSTER HAD ANY TAIL AT ALL
SO THE NEXT TIME HE GOT IN TROUBLE INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY HE TRIED PLAYING DEAD
IT CERTAINLY DID
NOW YOU KNOW PETER RABBIT WHY BOBBY COON WEARS RINGS ON HIS TAIL CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
AND THEN HE MADE A DISCOVERY--SUCH A SPLENDID DISCOVERY
AND I'D FLY IN THE DAYTIME BECAUSE THERE IS MORE GOING ON THEN
IT WAS THEN THAT HE ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE TO GIVE HIM A BAG OF PERFUME SO STRONG THAT IT WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY ILL BUT HIMSELF
A WHOLE SKIN IS BETTER THAN A FULL STOMACH BUT BOTH A WHOLE SKIN AND A FULL STOMACH ARE BETTER STILL SAID HE TO HIMSELF
STILL WHEN HE IS IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM AN ENEMY IT MUST BE VERY AWKWARD TO HAVE TO CARRY HIS HOUSE ON HIS BACK
OLD MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT WATCHED HIM AND SMILED TO HERSELF
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY IS THAT IF I WERE IN OLD MOTHER NATURE'S PLACE I WOULD GIVE SOME PLAIN FOLKS HANDSOME SUITS
SHE PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD WHEN HIS HEART CHANGED AND HE CHANGED HIS WAYS
GET BUSY AND CLEAN UP ADVISED MR WOODCHUCK HURRYING ABOUT HIS OWN WORK
THAT IS HOW HE FIRST CAME TO THINK OF MAKING A DAM AND A POND
HA HA HA AT FIRST GRANDFATHER FROG WAS ANGRY VERY ANGRY INDEED
PETER SAFE IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH WATCHED
FINALLY THEY GAVE UP ASKING HIM
WHENEVER HE MET ONE OF HIS GRUMBLING NEIGHBORS HE WOULD SAY
PLEASE DO I HAVE A MIND NOT TO JUST TO GET EVEN WITH YOU SAID GRANDFATHER FROG SETTLING HIMSELF COMFORTABLY BUT I BELIEVE I WILL TO SHOW YOU THAT THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO CAN TAKE A JOKE WITHOUT LOSING THEIR TEMPER GOODY CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY CHUCK TOGETHER SITTING DOWN SIDE BY SIDE ON THE VERY EDGE OF THE BANK
BUT JERRY WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
FUNNY PLACE TO BUILD A HOUSE ISN'T IT JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY
I'D GO ON LONG JOURNEYS AND SEE THE GREAT WORLD
AFTER A LONG TIME GRANDFATHER FROG BEGAN AGAIN
IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO HAVE A SNUG HOUSE UNDER THE GROUND WHERE ONE CAN SLEEP THE LONG COLD WINTER AWAY AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE BUT WHAT ANY ONE WANTS TO LIVE UNDER THE GROUND ALL THE TIME FOR IN THE BEAUTIFUL SPRINGTIME AND SUMMERTIME AND AUTUMNTIME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HE PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THEM NOW BUT AFTER THEY WERE THROUGH PAYING THEIR RESPECTS AND HAD GONE AWAY HE KEPT TURNING OVER AND OVER IN HIS MIND WHAT HE HAD OVERHEARD THEM SAY WHEN THEY THOUGHT HE WAS ASLEEP
WHEN I'M SURE THAT I CAN'T IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO GO TO OLD MOTHER NATURE NOW OF COURSE IT IS VERY HARD TO THINK WHEN YOU ARE TWISTING AND DODGING AND TURNING IN THE AIR OF COURSE SAID PETER RABBIT JUST AS IF HE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
HE SPENT ALL HIS SPARE TIME ADMIRING HIS NEW TAIL
PRESENTLY SOME OF THEM SPIED JIMMY SKUNK SLOWLY AMBLING DOWN THE CROOKED LITTLE PATH STOPPING EVERY FEW STEPS TO PULL OVER A LOOSE STONE OR STICK
WHY PADDY THE BEAVER HAS A BROAD TAIL LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS HE WENT RIGHT ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AS THEY WERE ALL VERY HUNGRY THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN THE FEAST WOULD BE READY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO PETER INTERRUPTED GRANDFATHER FROG HE WOULD MAKE NO REPLY SAVE TO RUN OUT HIS TONGUE AT THEM THEN OLD KING BEAR WISHED THAT HE HADN'T A TAIL IT MUST BE FINE TO FLY THOUGHT PETER
I WONDER WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE VOICE WAS SO CLOSE TO STRIPED CHIPMUNK THAT IT MADE HIM JUMP
HE WASN'T SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER ANIMALS
YES SAH HE HOLLER RIGHT DOWN THAT CHIMNEY
AT LAST HE REACHED THE SMILING POOL AND SLIPPED INTO THE WATER LEAVING THE PIECE OF BARK ON THE BANK
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL LIKE SPOTTY JUST AS FOND OF THE WATER AND JUST AS SLOW MOVING BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE WHICH SPOTTY HAS NOW
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT JENNY WREN BUSTLED OFF BEFORE PETER COULD FIND HIS TONGUE
ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
ILLUSTRATION
NOW PETER WAS SAFE IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH
IF I GO OUTSIDE THEY WILL SOON FIND ME AND IF I STAY HERE THEY WILL DIG ME OUT
HE WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS LITTLE PLAIN BROWN COAT AND TOOK THE BEST OF CARE OF IT
SO HE GREW FATTER AND FATTER WHILE OTHERS GREW THINNER
PETER WAS SO SURPRISED THAT HE COULDN'T FIND HIS TONGUE
I'LL WAIT A BIT SAID SHE TO HERSELF AND SEE HOW HE BEHAVES
HE COULDN'T YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF HIS BRIGHT COAT
I CAN'T CLIMB TREES LIKE MR SQUIRREL AND I CAN'T SWIM LIKE MR MUSKRAT
BIG MR BOB CAT FOUND THE HOLE IN THE STUMP RIGHT AWAY
SO MATTERS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE UNTIL ONCE MORE OLD MOTHER NATURE VISITED THE GREEN FOREST TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE
HE MEANS HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY HE WHISPERED WITH A CHUCKLE
JUST NOW IT IS RIGHT HERE SAID SPOTTY
AND THAT CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG IS HOW MR BEAVER CAME BY HIS BROAD TAIL
ALL HE HAS GOT TO DO IS TO GO INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND STAY THERE UNTIL THE DANGER IS PAST
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WAS JUST THE LEAST LITTLE HINT OF A SMILE IN THE CORNERS OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S BIG MOUTH
IN THOSE DAYS MINER'S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED DIDN'T LIVE UNDER GROUND CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG
HE LOOK ROUND RIGHT SMART FO A CHIMNEY FO TO WARM HIS TOES AN PRETTY SOON HE SEE ONE WHERE HE NEVER BEEN BEFORE
RIGHT AWAY OLD KING BEAR KNEW THAT OLD MR POSSUM HAD BEEN UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AND HE TOLD HIS VISITORS THAT THEY WERE THE VICTIMS OF A PRACTICAL JOKE
HE HAD NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT ON THAT SCORE
THEN CAME HARD TIMES
HE WAS TOO SLOW AND AWKWARD TO RUN OR TO FIGHT
OLD KING BEAR PRETENDED TO WAKE UP JUST THEN AND RIGHT AWAY MR FOX AND MR WOLF WERE AS POLITE AND SMILING AS YOU PLEASE AND BEGAN TO FLATTER HIM
THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING ADDED STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMBING OUT THE HAIR OF HIS FUNNY LITTLE TAIL
OLD MOTHER WEST WIND 2
UNC BILLY POSSUM'S GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED WAS WAS THIS WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED PETER
PETER IS PRETTY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE HAS WHICH IS QUITE AS IT SHOULD BE
XVI WHY PADDY THE BEAVER HAS A BROAD TAIL USUALLY THE THING THAT INTERESTS US MOST IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT OURSELVES
AWAY THEY ALL HURRIED TO THE SMILING POOL
THEY GREW HARDER AND HARDER
HE WAS DRESSED ALL IN BLACK
NONE OF HIS FRIENDS ON LAND HAD SUCH A BIG FINE HOUSE AND MR MUSKRAT WAS VERY PROUD OF IT
SEEMED LIKE HE JES WENT ROUND FROM MO'NING TO NIGHT ASKING QUESTIONS CONTINUED OL MISTAH BUZZARD GOT SO THAT EVE'YBODY DREADED TO SEE THAT NO COUNT BUZZARD COMING BECAUSE HE BOUND TO PESTER WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS WHAT DON'T CONCERN HIM NO WAYS
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA SHOUTED PETER
AFTER A LONG TIME MR BOB CAT GAVE UP AND WENT OFF GROWLING AND SNARLING
OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY-LIPPERTY-LIP
SOMETIMES IT WAS OF TERRIBLE FRIGHTS THAT SOME OF THE LITTLEST PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED BY BEING WAKENED IN THE NIGHT AND SEEING A FIERCE FACE WITH LONG SHARP TEETH GRINNING AT THEM
THERE WAS THE GREATEST CHANGING OF CLOTHES YOU EVER DID SEE
PRETTY SOON ALONG CAME MR LYNX
AND THEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE VERY ONES WHO ADMIRED HIS TAIL SO TO HIS FACE WERE LAUGHING AT HIM AND POKING FUN AT HIM BEHIND HIS BACK
NOW AT THIS TIME MR COON HAD A VERY PLAIN TAIL
IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE TIME HE STAYS IN THE WATER
NOW IT HAPPENED THAT CURLED UP ON A LITTLE GRASSY TUSSOCK TAKING AN EARLY MORNING SUN-BATH LAY LITTLE MR GREENSNAKE
WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT VII
WHO'S GOT A HANDSOMER ONE GRANDFATHER FROG GLARED WITH HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES AT PETER
AND THEN OLD KING BEAR WISHED THAT HE HADN'T A TAIL MORE THAN EVER HE WISHED THAT HE DID HAVE A TAIL
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH A BIG TAIL IF YOU HAD ONE
WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS PETER RABBIT THAT YOU FORGET TO SPEAK TO YOUR ELDERS PETER STARED EAGERLY INTO THE SMILING POOL AND PRESENTLY HE SAW TWO GREAT GOGGLY EYES AND THE TOP OF A GREEN HEAD WAY OUT ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SMILING POOL
OLD MR RABBIT THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF PETER RABBIT WAS ALWAYS GETTING INTO TROUBLE
IF YOU HAD USED YOUR EYES WHEN YOU VISITED PADDY YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED FOR YOURSELF HOW HE CAME BY IT REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG GRUFFLY
IT WOULD DO NO HARM TO TRY
HE DIDN'T LIKE TO GO TO OLD MOTHER NATURE AND COMPLAIN THAT HIS NEW WINGS WERE NOT ALL THAT HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE IT BUT WHEN HE TRIED TO SWIM HE FOUND THAT IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN HIS OLD TAIL FOR SWIMMING
NOW I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY OF COURSE HE MEANT THAT PETER'S EFFORT TO KEEP STILL WAS VERY GOOD BUT PETER DIDN'T KNOW THIS AND HE COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT GRANDFATHER FROG MEANT
EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS TO HURRY AT TIMES ANYWAY BUT JIMMY NEVER DOES
PETER RABBIT SCRATCHED ONE LONG EAR THOUGHTFULLY AS HE REPLIED
A LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG OLD MR FOX THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF REDDY FOX WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST OF ALL THE FOREST AND MEADOW PEOPLE JUST AS REDDY IS NOW
IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER TO WORK WHEN ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE TO HELP SO HE SIGHED ONCE MORE AND FOLDED HIS ARMS INSTEAD OF BEGINNING WORK AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
YES SAH MAH FAM'LY NAME IS VULTURE BUT WE-UNS DONE BEEN CALLED BUZZARDS SO LONG THAT AH DON KNOW AS AH WOULD KNOW AH WAS BEING SPOKEN TO IF AH WAS CALLED MISTAH VULTURE AN DO AH UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF YOUR FAM'LY HAVE RED HAIDS INQUIRED UNC BILLY
WHY DOES REDDY WEAR A RED COAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW JENNY WREN LOOKED VERY HARD AT PETER WITH HER SHARP EYES
HE SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT SO AS TO HEAR BETTER
WHO IS IT NEVER NEVER HURRIES
THE ADVENTURES OF CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL 10
CHUG-A-RUM SAID HE AT LAST WITH A SUDDENNESS THAT MADE PETER JUMP
AT FIRST MR BAT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
GRANDFATHER FROG SNAPPED AT A FOOLISH GREEN FLY AND WHEN IT WAS SAFELY TUCKED AWAY INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS THREE LITTLE VISITORS AND THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES
THANK YO BRER RABBIT
THAT'S RIGHT MR SKUNK
THEN HE SHIFT ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY AN LISTEN
EVERY ONE BEGAN TO GRUMBLE
WHEN HE WENT ON LAND HE WOULD COVER HIMSELF WITH MUD AND THEN WHEN HE HEARD ANYBODY COMING HE WOULD LIE PERFECTLY STILL WITH HIS LEGS AND HIS TAIL AND HIS HEAD DRAWN IN JUST AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE JUST A LITTLE LUMP OF BROWN EARTH
MR COON USED TO THINK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THAT TAIL AND WISH AND WISH THAT IT WAS HANDSOME
IT WAS BROAD AND THICK AND FLAT
NO SAH HE DON MIND THAT A BIT
I DON'T LIKE TO BE KEPT WAITING
MOTHER WEST WIND'S CHILDREN 3
HIS NEIGHBORS WHO WERE HAVING HARD WORK TO MAKE A LIVING GREW ENVIOUS AND SAID UNKIND THINGS ABOUT HIM AND HINTED THAT HE MUST BE STEALING OR HE NEVER COULD HAVE SO MUCH TO EAT
I KNOW I AM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG
NOW WHEN OLD MR RABBIT HEARD THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS COMING HIS HEART SANK WAY WAY DOWN FOR HE KNEW JUST HOW ANGRY SHE WOULD BE WHEN SHE SAW HIS HOUSE HIS GARDEN AND HIS SHABBY SUIT
THEN THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES AND TO STEAL FROM EACH OTHER
THAT'S BECAUSE HIS GRANDPAP WAS TRIFLING AN PO TRASH JES LIKE HE IS PETER RABBIT PRICKED UP HIS EARS
AND THEN AS HE SAW FLITTER TWIST AND TURN FLY HIGH FLY LOW AND GO ROUND AND ROUND PETER'S HEAD WOULD BEGIN TO SWIM AND GROW DIZZY AND HE WONDERED AND WONDERED HOW IT WAS THAT FLITTER HIMSELF DIDN'T GROW DIZZY
WHY OLD MAN COYOTE HAS MANY VOICES IX
DO TELL ME ABOUT IT CRIED PETER
THAT SHOWS THAT HE IS JUST AS WISE AS WAS HIS GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED ABOUT WHOM I AM TELLING YOU REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
IT WAS ALL WEEDS AND BRAMBLES
BUT WITH ALL HIS PRIDE HE NEVER FORGOT THAT IT WAS A REWARD FOR TRYING TO BE CONTENT WITH HIS SURROUNDINGS AND MAKING THE BEST OF THEM
HI SPOTTY HE SHOUTED
HI SPOTTY HE SHOUTED
JUST THEN HE SPIED A FAT FOOLISH GREEN FLY AND BLEW IT RIGHT OVER TO GRANDFATHER FROG WHO SNAPPED IT UP IN A FLASH
PETER WATCHED HIM OUT OF SIGHT
NO BRER POSSUM IT ISN'T REPLIED OL MISTAH BUZZARD
SOMETHING NO OTHER ANIMAL HAD BUT HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER RUN AND JUMP
THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE AND WOULD NOT HAVE TO COMPLAIN TO OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE WASN'T SO SURE THAT THAT WAS A REAL NAP
HIS HOUSE WAS A TUMBLE-DOWN AFFAIR IN WHICH NO ONE BUT MR RABBIT WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF LIVING AND HIS GARDEN--OH DEAR ME SUCH A GARDEN YOU NEVER DID SEE
BUT THINGS WORTH HAVING ARE WORTH WORKING FOR AND WITH THAT HE BEGAN CUTTING AGAIN
HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT BEFORE BUT NOW HE COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF HIS HEAD
NEVER MIND PETER RABBIT I'LL GET YOU YET SNARLED REDDY AS HE GAVE UP AND STARTED BACK FOR THE GREEN FOREST
CHUG-A-RUM REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG IN HIS DEEPEST GRUFFEST VOICE
HE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE AND WHAT IS THERE IN LIFE BETTER THAN TO BE HAPPY AND SATISFIED NOTHING REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK AT WHOM GRANDFATHER FROG HAPPENED TO BE LOOKING WHEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION
JUST TO FOOL PEOPLE STUPID SAID HE
BUT IT WASN'T SO
IT WAS A NUISANCE WHEN HE CLIMBED A TREE
THEY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING THAT FOR
GOOD MORNING MR COON SAID SHE IN HER PLEASANTEST VOICE
THE ADVENTURES OF REDDY FOX 2
MY MY BUT HIS TEMPER DID BOIL OVER
YOU MAY HAVE BIG EARS AND BE ABLE TO HEAR A GREAT DEAL SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN YOU HAVE ANY BUSINESS TO HEAR BUT YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH BY THIS TIME TO HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CANNOT BELIEVE ALL YOU HEAR AND WITH THAT THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES INDIGNANTLY RACED AWAY TO SPREAD THE NEWS ALL OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE HE WAS SO DREADFULLY CURIOUS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS JUST AS PETER RABBIT IS NOW
TELL ME THAT
MR FOX USED TO LISTEN AS IF VERY MUCH SHOCKED AND SAY THAT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE ABOUT IT AND WONDER WHO IT COULD BE WHO WOULD DO SUCH DREADFUL THINGS
PLAIN CLOTHES SOMETIMES COVER THE KINDEST HEARTS AND FINE CLOTHES OFTEN ARE A WARNING TO BEWARE OF MISCHIEF I--I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU ARE RIGHT ADMITTED PETER
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SIT ON SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE HER EYES TWINKLING
BUT FROM LITTLE MR GREENSNAKE THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR AND SOMETIMES JUST FOR FUN PETER WOULD JUMP RIGHT OVER HIM
SHE HURRIED TO TELL OLD MOTHER NATURE ALL ABOUT IT AND BIG TEARS ROLLED DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE TOLD HOW SHE HAD LOST ALL HER BEAUTIFUL TAIL FEATHERS
I WISH SAID PETER AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATCH OF SWEET CLOVER THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY IT IS THAT JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES AND WE WISH THAT YOU WOULD TELL US THE SAME THING CRIED ONE OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
MR LYNX GAVE A HURRIED LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND BEGAN TO RUN
IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM A FUNNY PLACE
WHAT ARE YOUR EYES FOR PETER RABBIT
SHE ASKED HIM A GREAT MANY QUESTIONS AND FOR EACH ONE HE HAD A READY REPLY
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW HE COMES BY SUCH A QUEER TAIL ILLUSTRATION
IT'S OF NO USE THOUGHT MR MOLE
THEY GREW WORSE AND WORSE AND WHEN AT LAST OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG SHE HEARD SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHERE TO BEGIN TO STRAIGHTEN MATTERS OUT
I ALWAYS DID LIKE GREEN
MRS PETER PROBABLY THINKS SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND AWAY HE WENT LIPPERTY-LIPPERTY-LIP
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID
UP THE TREE AFTER HIM THEY SCRAMBLED AND HE CREPT AS FAR OUT AS HE COULD GET ON ONE OF THE BRANCHES
I--I--DON'T WANT TO STAMMERED PETER
HE WAS VERY THRIFTY WAS MR BEAVER
BUT THEN JERRY MUSKRAT IS A FUNNY FELLOW
THERE WAS SAUCY PERT LITTLE JENNY WREN FUSSING AROUND IN ONE OF THE OLD BRAMBLE BUSHES
HONOR
HE WOULD MAKE A LITTLE TUNNEL OFF ONE SIDE AND HIDE IN THAT
WHY CHEATING HAD BECOME SUCH A HABIT WITH HIM THAT HE ACTUALLY TRIED TO CHEAT HIMSELF--TO CHEAT HIS CONSCIENCE
HE SO CURIOUS HE DON NOTICE ANYTHING AN PRETTY SOON HE PLUMB FO'GET WHERE HE IS AN THAT HE IS LISTENING WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK DIDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO GET THERE
SUDDENLY PETER SAW A DARK FORM SKULKING AMONG THE BLACK SHADOWS
HE WENT RIGHT ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS FRONTISPIECE BOOKS BY THORNTON W
SO HE TEASED AND HE TEASED UNTIL FINALLY GRANDFATHER FROG PROMISED HIM THAT ON THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE WOULD TELL PETER WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL
NOW I CAN'T RUN FAST BECAUSE MY LEGS ARE TOO SHORT
I WONDER WELL WHAT DO YOU WONDER THE SAME THING YOU WONDER LAUGHED JOHNNY CHUCK
OF COURSE IT IS REPLIED SPOTTY PUTTING NOTHING BUT HIS HEAD OUT YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND ME AT HOME WHENEVER YOU CALL PETER AND THAT IS MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY OF MOST OTHER PEOPLE ALL THE WAY TO HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH PETER THOUGHT ABOUT SPOTTY AND HOW QUEER IT WAS THAT HE SHOULD CARRY HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM
THEN PETER WOULD LAUGH AND WINK AT HIM AGAIN
YOU SEE OLD MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES
HERE IS PETER RABBIT HIS GRANDCHILD A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED WITH LONG LEGS AND LONG EARS AND THE BAD HABIT OF CURIOSITY ALL BECAUSE OLD MR RABBIT HAD A BAD HABIT AND DIDN'T TRY TO OVERCOME IT
YES SIR HE BECAME A THIEF
HE MENTIONED THE MATTER TO JOHNNY CHUCK
WHAT IS THE REASON THAT YOU STAY IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH WHEN REDDY FOX IS AROUND SO THAT HE WON'T CATCH ME OF COURSE REPLIED PETER
THEY TOLD HIM HOW PROUD THEY WERE OF THEIR KING AND HOW HANDSOME HE WAS AND A LOT OF OTHER NICE THINGS ALL OF WHICH HE HAD HEARD OFTEN BEFORE AND HAD BELIEVED
SO MR COYOTE PUT HIS NOSE UP IN THE AIR AND HOWLED
PRESENTLY WHILE HE WAS WONDERING WHY THEY DIDN'T JUMP ON HIM AND TEAR HIM TO PIECES OLD KING BEAR SPOKE
YES SIR MR FOX WAS VERY POLITE
AND ALL HIS CHILDREN AND HIS CHILDREN'S CHILDREN HAD THAT SAME WONDERFUL VOICE JUST AS OLD MAN COYOTE HAS NOW
MR LYNX GREW ANXIOUS AND LOST HIS APPETITE
BECAUSE HE CAN'T REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
SO HE WATCHED UNTIL THE WAY WAS CLEAR AND THEN HE STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO LIPPERTY-LIPPERTY-LIP
BUT AFTER A LITTLE THE LITTLE PEOPLE OVER WHOM HE RULED BEGAN TO BRING HIM TRIBUTE SO THAT HE NO LONGER HAD TO HUNT FOR ENOUGH TO EAT
YOUR COAT IS HANDSOME VERY HANDSOME INDEED GRANDFATHER FROG PETER HASTENED TO SAY
MOTHER NATURE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER AND THEN SHE DID BUT SHE MADE HIM PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NEVER USE IT UNLESS HE WAS IN GREAT DANGER
BY BEING VERY SMART AND QUICK HE CAUGHT A FEW BEFORE IT WAS TOO DARK FOR HIM TO SEE
WHAT SHALL I DO WAILED MR RABBIT WRINGING HIS HANDS
IT WAS NOTHING BUT A LITTLE SMEAR OF RED CLAY BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS HOW HE EVER FOUND OUT THAT HE COULD FOOL PEOPLE THAT WAY AND HOW HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FOOL THEM I SUSPECT THAT HIS MAMMY TAUGHT HIM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG WITH ANOTHER CHUCKLE WAY DOWN DEEP IN HIS THROAT
I ALWAYS LIKE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THOSE WHO DO SOMETHING FOR ME AND I SUPPOSE NOW THAT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU WHY IT IS THAT JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES
SHE TOLD HIM HOW PLEASED SHE WAS TO FIND HIM SO NEAT AND CLEAN AND MR COON JUST TINGLED ALL OVER WITH PLEASURE
A LITTLE WAY FROM HIM SAT PETER RABBIT
WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED V
I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS SUCH A QUEER TAIL IN ALL THE WORLD AND I DON'T SEE WHAT POSSIBLE USE IT CAN BE
I'LL HELP YOU IF I GET THROUGH MY OWN WORK IN TIME SHOUTED MR WOODCHUCK OVER HIS SHOULDER
MOTHER WEST WIND'S ANIMAL FRIENDS 4
SOME EVEN LEFT THEIR HOMES AND WENT OUT INTO THE GREAT WORLD TO TRY TO FIND A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE ONLY TO FIND THAT THE GREAT WORLD WAS A HARDER PLACE TO LIVE IN THAN THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS
A LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF FLITTER THE BAT FIRST LEARNED TO FLY I KNOW CRIED PETER EAGERLY
THAT'S SO REPLIED JOHNNY THOUGHTFULLY
ONCE ON A TIME LONG LONG AGO LIVED MR BEAVER THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF PADDY UP THERE IN THE GREEN FOREST
THEN WHY DON'T YOU BUILD YOU A FINE HOUSE ON THE LAND ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE JUST KEPT RIGHT ON WORKING AND ONLY STOPPED TO REST WHEN HIS LEGS ACHED SO THAT HE HAD TO
HE DIDN'T NEED ANY OTHER HOUSE THAN JUST THAT HARD SPOTTED SHELL INSIDE OF WHICH HE WAS NOW SO COSILY TUCKED AWAY
FOR A FEW DAYS OLD KING BEAR WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY
WHEN HE DID GO ON HE TOOK THE GREATEST CARE NOT TO SHAKE OFF THAT PIECE OF BARK FOR HE DIDN'T KNOW BUT THAT ANY MINUTE HE MIGHT WANT TO HIDE UNDER IT AGAIN
MR COON GOT UP AND MADE A VERY LOW BOW
PETER HURRIED AWAY TO TELL ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND THE NEXT AFTERNOON THEY WERE ALL ON HAND ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL TO HEAR THE STORY ABOUT BOBBY COON'S TAIL
YOU SEE REDDY FOX WOULDN'T RUN THE RISK OF TEARING HIS HANDSOME RED COAT ON THE BRAMBLES
THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF OLD MAN COYOTE WHO LIVED LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG WAS VERY MUCH AS OLD MAN COYOTE IS TO-DAY
SO SOMETIMES WHEN PETER SEES THE FINE TAILS OF HIS NEIGHBORS A LITTLE BIT OF ENVY CREEPS INTO HIS HEART FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE
IF HE HAS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT IT IS ENOUGH TO CALL A REALLY TRULY TAIL WELL IT IS A REALLY TRULY TAIL EVEN IF YOU DON'T THINK SO RETORTED GRANDFATHER FROG AND HE HAS IT FOR A REMINDER A REMINDER EXCLAIMED PETER LOOKING VERY MUCH PUZZLED
NOBODY DID
HE STILL REMEMBERED THE MUSTARD AND TRIED TO FOOL HIMSELF INTO THINKING THAT HE WAS SIMPLY SPITING OLD MOTHER NATURE BUT RIGHT DOWN IN HIS HEART HE KNEW THAT EVEN IF HE SHOULD BE TOLD THAT NEVER AGAIN WOULD THERE BE MUSTARD IN HIS FOOD HE WOULD WASH IT JUST THE SAME
THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MR SNAKE
MR FOX LOOKED MEEKER THAN EVER AND HE WAS VERY HUMBLE AND POLITE
WHO IS IT DOES JUST WHAT HE PLEASES JUST LIKE US MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
HE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ALL HIS SUBJECTS TO IT AND THEY ALL TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS A VERY WONDERFUL TAIL AND WAS VERY BECOMING TO HIM
NOW ONE BAD HABIT ALMOST ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER
YES SIR HE CAME BY IT HONESTLY ENOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS HANDED DOWN TO HIM BY HIS FATHER WHO GOT IT FROM HIS FATHER WHO GOT IT FROM HIS FATHER AND SO ON WAY BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG BUT GRANDFATHER FROG PAUSED AND THAT DREAMY FAR-AWAY LOOK WHICH PETER HAD SEEN SO OFTEN CAME INTO HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES
WHEN IT CAME MR SNAKE'S TURN HE HAD NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE
YOU'D BETTER COME OUT OF THERE MR CHIPMUNK OR I'LL PULL YOU OUT SNARLED MR BOB CAT
A LONG LONG TIME AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THERE WAS VERY LITTLE DRY LAND AND MOST OF THE ANIMALS LIVED IN THE WATER
LET'S GO ASK HIM WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER GRANDFATHER FROG SAW THEM COMING AND HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY WERE COMING FOR A STORY
BESIDES ANY ONE WHO HAS TO KEEP SUCH A SHARP WATCH FOR REDDY FOX AS YOU DO OUGHT TO KNOW WHY HE WEARS A RED COAT
BUT PETER PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE AND AFTER SLOWLY WINKING ONE OF HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES AT JOHNNY CHUCK GRANDFATHER FROG CONTINUED
MRS
SOME HAD SHORT TAILS
THERE HE IS OVER ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND HE LOOKS AS IF HE MIGHT BE FEELING VERY GOOD-NATURED THIS MORNING
XII WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY OL MISTAH BUZZARD HAD JUST TOLD THE STORY OF WHY HE HAS A BALD HEAD AND IS PROUD OF IT
WHEN PETER KICKED IT IT FLEW OUT INTO THE AIR AND LANDED WITH A GREAT SPLASH IN THE SMILING POOL CLOSE BESIDE THE BIG GREEN LILY-PAD ON WHICH GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING
PETER WAS SITTING UP VERY STRAIGHT BUT HIS HANDS DROPPED RIGHT DOWN IN FRONT
WHY PETER SAID HE YOU LOOK SO SOBER THAT I THOUGHT YOU REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT
I WONDER IF MR COYOTE HAS GOT A BROTHER WITH HIM THOUGHT HE
COULDN'T YOU SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS A TAIL NO GRANDFATHER FROG
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO
IT CERTAINLY DOES REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
I KNOW A GREAT DEAL THAT I DON'T TELL WHICH IS MORE THAN SOME FOLKS CAN SAY REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
I WISH I HAD SUCH A HANDSOME COAT HE SAID WITH A LONG SIGH FOR YOU KNOW PETER'S COAT IS VERY PLAIN VERY PLAIN INDEED
YES SIR THAT IS THE ONE THING THAT EVER REALLY TROUBLES PETER
THEY DANCED OVER TO HIM AND FORMED A RING AROUND HIM WHILE THEY SANG
CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG
CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG
SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE EXCEPTING UNC BILLY POSSUM
THAT'S QUITE THE NICEST THING YO COULD SAY BUT IT'S TRUE SHOUTED ALL TOGETHER AND THEN EVERYBODY GAVE THREE CHEERS FOR OL MISTAH BUZZARD BEFORE STARTING OFF TO ATTEND TO THEIR OWN PRIVATE AFFAIRS
HE PLUMB FO'GET ALL ABOUT THIS AN HE HOLLER DOWN THAT CHIMNEY
WHO IS IT NEVER NEVER WORRIES
EACH IN TURN CAME UP AND SNIFFED OF MR POSSUM AND THEN THEY ALL WENT ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS
AND SO I'M GLAD THAT NO ONE KNOWS NOW JUST IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK WAS WHEN IN THE FALL IT CAME TIME TO PUT ON A NEW COAT TO HAVE OLD MOTHER NATURE HAND HIM OUT A BEAUTIFUL STRIPED COAT INSTEAD OF THE LITTLE PLAIN BROWN COAT HE HAD EXPECTED
MR BOB CAT FELT ROUND AND ROUND INSIDE THE HOLLOW STUMP AND RAKED HIS LONG CLAWS ON THE SIDES UNTIL LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK'S HAIR FAIRLY STOOD UP
AT FIRST HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT BUT PRETTY SOON MR FOX DELICATELY HINTED THAT THEY HAD COME IN RESPONSE TO THE INVITATION SENT BY MR POSSUM AND THAT AS THEY WERE ALL VERY HUNGRY THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN THE FEAST WOULD BE READY
AND THAT IS WHY JERRY MUSKRAT HAS BUILT THAT FINE HOUSE IN THE SMILING POOL AND HAS SO FEW ENEMIES CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG INTERRUPTED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
RIGHT AWAY ALL THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES BEGAN TO HUNT FOR FOOLISH GREEN FLIES AND BLOW THEM OVER TO GRANDFATHER FROG UNTIL HE DIDN'T HAVE ROOM FOR ANOTHER ONE INSIDE HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
OLD MR POSSUM WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST TO DEATH
WHAT'S THE MATTER MR MUSKRAT SHE ASKED
IF YOU'LL PROMISE TO SIT PERFECTLY STILL AND ASK NO FOOLISH QUESTIONS I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND SETTLED HIMSELF COMFORTABLY TO LISTEN
IT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG
THEN HE TURNED AROUND AND WITH ONE OF HIS LONG HIND-FEET HE KICKED THE TOADSTOOL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO PETER INTERRUPTED GRANDFATHER FROG PETER GRINNED AND WRINKLED HIS NOSE AT GRANDFATHER FROG
THEY BURN THE FEATHERS OFFEN HIS HAID AN NECK AN THE SOOT MAKE HIM BLACK ALL BUT HIS FEET AN LAIGS AN THE INSIDE OF HIS WINGS WHICH HE KEEP CLOSED
DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY CAN WINK LET'S GO ASK MR GREENSNAKE SAID PETER
SHE LET HIM FINISH THEN CALLED ALL THE OTHERS ABOUT HER AND TOLD THEM WHO HAD MADE ALL THE TROUBLE
HA HA HA
OF COURSE HE RIGHT SMART CURIOUS ABOUT THAT LIL OL TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE AND WHO LIVE THERE
THEN HE BEGAN THE MADDEST KIND OF A FROLIC WITH THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES UNTIL THEY AND HE WERE QUITE TIRED OUT AND READY FOR A GOOD REST
XV WHY SPOTTY THE TURTLE CARRIES HIS HOUSE WITH HIM SPOTTY THE TURTLE SAT ON AN OLD LOG ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL TAKING A SUN-BATH
NOW THERE WERE A FEW ANIMALS OF WHOM OLD MR MUSKRAT THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF JERRY MUSKRAT WAS ONE WHO LEARNED TO WALK AND RUN ON DRY LAND BUT WHO STILL LOVED THE WATER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG
AFTER A WHILE HE ALMOST FORGOT HOW TO RUN
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM
NOW I FEEL BETTER AND I KNOW MY SUPPER WILL TASTE BETTER SAID HE
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME PETER RABBIT
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT
NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD BEEN KEEPING A SHARP WATCH AS SHE ALWAYS DOES AND WHEN SHE FOUND THAT THEY WERE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO LIKE THE LAND BEST SHE DID ALL THAT SHE COULD TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM
BUT HALF AN HOUR LATER WHEN MR SKUNK HAPPENED TO PASS THE HOME OF MR CHIPMUNK THERE SAT MR RABBIT WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED WATCHING MR CHIPMUNK HURRYING ABOUT AS ONLY MR CHIPMUNK CAN
VI WHY SAMMY JAY HAS A FINE COAT SAMMY JAY HAS A VERY FINE COAT A VERY BEAUTIFUL COAT
THE ADVENTURES OF DANNY MEADOW MOUSE 8
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE BEGAN TO LOOK DOWN ON HIS NEIGHBORS FOR BEING SO HONEST THAT THEY DIDN'T SUSPECT OTHER PEOPLE OF BEING DISHONEST AND FOR BEING SO EASILY CHEATED
GRANDFATHER FROG'S BIG GOGGLY EYES TWINKLED
JOHNNY CHUCK TOOK HIS TIME FOR HE KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS
EVERYBODY WAS ALL THE TIME ON THE WATCH FOR IT AND SO WHERE IN THE PAST MR JAY HAD BEEN ABLE WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE TO STEAL ALL HE WANTED TO EAT NOW HE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY HAD TO WORK FOR HIS FOOD AND GET IT HONESTLY OR ELSE GO HUNGRY
I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE IT MR COON DIDN'T SEE ANY REWARD BUT HE THANKED HER JUST THE SAME AND OLD MOTHER NATURE WENT ON HER WAY
HE WENT RIGHT ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
WHEN YOU WANT SOME MORE FOOLISH GREEN FLIES JUST LET US KNOW AND WE'LL GET THEM FOR YOU CHUG-A-RUM
BUT HE ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO GET HOME BEFORE ANY OF HIS NEIGHBORS WERE AWAKE AND THEN HE'D WAIT UNTIL EVERYBODY WAS UP BEFORE HE SHOWED HIMSELF
HE HAD DISCOVERED OLD MOTHER NATURE FROWNING AT HIM
BURGESS
OF COURSE HE DID FOR HIS LEGS ARE LONG AND MADE FOR RUNNING BUT STRIPED CHIPMUNK WAS NOT FAR BEHIND
SHE HAD DONE HER VERY BEST TO GIVE EVERYBODY EVERYTHING THAT THEY REALLY NEEDED AND NOT TO GIVE THEM THINGS WHICH THEY DIDN'T NEED
WHY UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD IV
IN EVERY SINGLE BLESSED DAY THERE'S TIME FOR WORK AND TIME FOR PLAY
THE ADVENTURES OF MR
IT'S THAT TRIFLING NO COUNT COUSIN OF MINE
IF I COULD I WOULDN'T SPEND ALL MY TIME FLYING AROUND THE WAY FLITTER DOES
WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH AGAIN HE STILL KEPT HIS EYES CLOSED FOR HE COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT OF LOOKING AT THE CRUEL TEETH AND CLAWS OF OLD KING BEAR AND THE OTHERS
YOU SEE IT HAD BECOME A HABIT
OH GRANDFATHER FROG HE PANTED AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE SMILING POOL HAS BUSTER BEAR GOT A TAIL GRANDFATHER FROG REGARDED PETER IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
OF COURSE YOU KNOW WITHOUT ME TELLING YOU THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR SPOTTY'S CARRYING HIS HOUSE AROUND WITH HIM BECAUSE THERE IS A REASON FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD
SHE DECIDED THAT MR RABBIT SHOULD BE PUNISHED VERY SEVERELY
IF HE HAD BUILT IT ON LAND LIKE SENSIBLE PEOPLE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WAKEN HIM
SO MAKING SURE THAT REDDY FOX HAD DISAPPEARED IN THE GREEN FOREST PETER STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL LIPPERTY-LIPPERTY-LIP AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
THE VERY NEXT MORNING HE HURRIED OVER TO THE SMILING POOL TO TELL GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT IT
OH GRANDFATHER FROG I DIDN'T SEE YOU AT ALL CRIED PETER IF I HAD OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT
AND IT DID BOTHER IT A LOT
HE HAS A NUMBER OF FEATHERED FRIENDS WHOM HE LIKES EVER SO MUCH BETTER THAN HE DOES SAMMY JAY
SAMMY JAY'S FINE COAT ISN'T A REWARD FOR GOODNESS AS IS WINSOME BLUEBIRD'S BUT IS TO HELP THE OTHER LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND KEEP TRACK OF SAMMY WHEN HE IS SNEAKING AND SNOOPING AROUND LOOKING FOR MISCHIEF
PETER RABBIT PETER GRINNED GOOD-NATUREDLY
OF COURSE GRANDFATHER FROG KNOWS PETER AND HIS CURIOSITY SO WELL THAT HE HAD GUESSED RIGHT AWAY THAT PETER WOULD COME TO HIM FOR THE STORY JUST AS PETER DID
CHUG-A-RUM HE BEGAN
WILL YOU TELL ME IF I COME AGAIN SOME TIME WHEN YOU ARE NOT SO SLEEPY NOW LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE GRANDFATHER FROG IS RATHER FOND OF PETER RABBIT AND NOW PETER LOOKED SO TRULY SORRY AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS SUCH A LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN PETER'S EYES THAT GRANDFATHER FROG FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIS CROSSNESS
THEN OLD KING BEAR WISHED THAT HE HADN'T A TAIL AND EVERY BEAR SINCE THAT LONG-AGO DAY HAS CARRIED ABOUT WITH HIM A REMINDER--YOU CAN HARDLY CALL IT A REAL TAIL--OF THE SILLY FOOLISH DISCONTENT OF OLD KING BEAR CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
I GUESS THIS IS NO PLACE FOR ME WITH THAT HE STARTED TO SNEAK AWAY
THE MORE THEY TALKED ABOUT IT THE MORE THEY WANTED TO KNOW
MR BEAVER HAD TO SIT UP ON HIS HIND LEGS TO DO IT AND HIS LEGS GREW VERY VERY TIRED
I WAS WISHING THAT MY TAIL WAS HANDSOMER SAID HE
HOWEVER WHAT HE CARED MOST ABOUT WAS THE STORY SO HE SETTLED HIMSELF TO LISTEN HIS LONG EARS STANDING STRAIGHT UP AND HIS EYES STRETCHED WIDE OPEN AS HE WATCHED GRANDFATHER FROG
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING STORY AND IT HAD BEEN LISTENED TO WITH THE CLOSEST ATTENTION BY A LOT OF THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE
GRANDFATHER FROG LOOKED AT PETER SEVERELY AND PETER HASTENED TO BEG HIS PARDON
I'M SO HUNGRY THAT I'M WASTING AWAY TO A SHADOW
THAT'S RIGHT SAID MR RABBIT STARTING ALONG BRISKLY JUST AS IF HE WAS GOING TO HURRY RIGHT HOME AND BEGIN WORK THAT VERY INSTANT
CHUG-A-RUM EXCLAIMED GRANDFATHER FROG AND DIVED HEAD FIRST INTO THE WATER
NO SIR HE DIDN'T THINK OF THAT
THEY ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL AT ALL
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WITH WHICH PETER IS REALLY DISSATISFIED AND IT IS ONLY ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN HE HASN'T MUCH OF ANYTHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT THAT HE IS DISSATISFIED WITH THIS
FLITTER FLIES AT NIGHT BECAUSE HE IS SAFEST THEN AND BECAUSE HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT OH SAID PETER AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED
A GOOD HEART AND HONEST WAYS ARE BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES PETER RABBIT PETER LOOKED UP
STILL IT IS A REAL TAIL AND HE HAS OFTEN COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THAT THOUGHT
CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG TRYING VERY HARD TO GET THOSE LEGS OUT OF SIGHT
HE'S A BUZZARD OR A VULTURE IF YO LIKE THAT BETTER JES LIKE AH AM BUT HE BELONGS TO ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE FAM'LY
YOU SEE THEY KNOW THAT THE REASON HE WON'T PLAY IS BECAUSE HE HAS WORK TO DO AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK BELIEVES AND SAYS
OF COURSE THAT WASN'T A NICE THING TO DO NOT A BIT NICE
THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF THEM THE MORE DISCONTENTED HE GREW BECAUSE HE HAD NONE
THEN HE MADE A DISCOVERY
BY THE WAY MR COON I AM SO PLEASED WITH YOUR NEATNESS THAT I AM LEAVING YOU A REWARD
KNOWING SAMMY AS WELL AS I DO IT IS HARD WORK TO BELIEVE THAT HE CAME BY IT HONESTLY GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED WAY DOWN DEEP IN HIS THROAT
HE YAWNED AND BLINKED AND THEN HIS EYES SUDDENLY FLEW WIDE OPEN WITH FRIGHT
EVERY DAY PETER VISITED THE SMILING POOL TO TEASE GRANDFATHER FROG FOR A STORY--FOR ONE PARTICULAR STORY
HE WAS VERY POLITE AND OFFERED TO HELP OLD KING BEAR HUNT FOR HIS LOST BREAKFAST
GOOD MORNING GRANDFATHER FROG SAID JOHNNY CHUCK
WHY JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES VI
HE HAD TWO OR THREE VERY NARROW ESCAPES AND THESE SET HIM TO THINKING
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING SO WISTFUL FOR PETER RABBIT DEMANDED GRANDFATHER FROG
YES REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK WINKING AT GRANDFATHER FROG AND NOW WE ARE GOING BACK HOME PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED AND TO THIS DAY PETER RABBIT WONDERS WHAT THE STORY WAS THAT HE MISSED
SOME OF THEM WERE HANDED DOWN TO HIM WITH HIS FINE COAT JUST THE SAME AS YOUR TROUBLESOME CURIOSITY WAS HANDED DOWN TO YOU WITH THE WHITE PATCH ON THE SEAT OF YOUR TROUSERS PETER NODDED
OF COURSE IT IS VERY HANDY TO HAVE HIS HOUSE ALWAYS WITH HIM
IN THOSE DAYS HE HAD A TAIL VERY MUCH LIKE THE TAIL OF JERRY MUSKRAT
WHY THAT IS THE HANDIEST THING I EVER HEARD OF NOW PETER KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE A GOOD STORY ABOUT SPOTTY AND HIS HOUSE AND YOU KNOW PETER DEARLY LOVES A GOOD STORY
HUMPH
INSTEAD HE WOULD RAISE HIS HEAD RUN HIS TONGUE OUT AT PETER AND HISS IN WHAT HE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY FIERCE AND ANGRY MANNER
YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T JEERED HAPPY JACK
CERT'NLY BRER POSSUM
UNC BILLY POSSUM'S GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED WAS VERY MUCH AS UNC BILLY IS NOW ONLY HE WAS A LITTLE MORE SPRY AND KNEW BETTER THAN TO STUFF HIMSELF SO FULL THAT HE COULDN'T RUN
ONE DAY HE NOTICED THAT A LOT OF STICKS HAD CAUGHT IN THE STREAM WHERE HE MADE HIS HOME AND THAT BECAUSE THE WATER COULD NOT WORK ITS WAY BETWEEN THEM AS FAST AS WHERE NOTHING HINDERED IT IT MADE A LITTLE POOL JUST ABOVE THE STICKS
MISTAH BUZZARD HE GIVE A MIGHTY SQUAWK AN FLY AWAY
AFTER THAT PETER COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT OLD MAN COYOTE'S WONDERFUL VOICE THAT SOUNDED LIKE MANY VOICES AND AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE HURRIED OVER TO THE SMILING POOL TO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG WHAT IT MEANT
HE WAS WORKING JUST AS USUAL ONE DAY WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME ALONG TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
HE WOULD ASK ALL HIS NEIGHBORS TO HELP HIM AND PERHAPS THEN HE COULD GET HIS HOUSE AND GARDEN IN ORDER BY THE TIME OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED
HE NEVER MEDDLED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS
I'M EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED FOR THE STORY GRANDFATHER FROG
NO RETORTED THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
HE'S ASLEEP SAID JOHNNY LOOKING DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED AND I GUESS WE'D BETTER NOT DISTURB HIM FOR HE MIGHT WAKE UP CROSS AND OF COURSE WE WOULDN'T GET A STORY IF HE DID PETER LOOKED AT GRANDFATHER FROG SHARPLY
SO WE-UNS SIT ON THE CHIMNEY-TOPS WHENEVER OL JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
HE NEVER WORRIED BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE FEARED NOBODY
EVEN OLD MR TOAD PUT ON A NEW SUIT UNDER HIS OLD ONE AND PLANNED TO PULL THE OLD ONE OFF AND THROW IT AWAY AS SOON AS OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOULD ARRIVE
MR SQUIRREL GRUMBLED
HO HO HO
I'VE GOT TO THINK OF SOME WAY OUT OF MY TROUBLES MYSELF THOUGHT OLD MR BAT
NO I DON'T EITHER HE DECLARED
HE SNARLED WHEN HE SAW IT
WHEN HE GOT THERE AND THOUGHT IT ALL OVER HE THOUGHT THAT THE BEST JOKE OF ALL WAS THE WAY HE HAD MADE EVERYBODY THINK THAT HE WAS DEAD
OH GRANDFATHER FROG DO TELL US WHY IT IS THAT JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER
IF YOU PLEASE HOW DOES YOUR COUSIN HAPPEN TO HAVE A BLACK HEAD ASKED PETER AS POLITELY AS HE KNEW HOW
NOW MR COYOTE COULD RUN VERY FAST AND HE RAN NOW AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD IN A BIG CIRCLE YELPING AND HOWLING AND MAKING HIS VOICE SOUND AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE EACH TIME
SO THOUGH SHE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS DOING IT JUST TO GET AHEAD OF HER SHE WAS GLAD FOR SHE WAS FOND OF MR COON IN SPITE OF THE BAD WAYS HE HAD GROWN INTO AND SHE KNEW THAT GOOD HABITS ARE LIKE BAD HABITS--ONCE STARTED THEY GROW AND GROW AND ARE VERY LIKELY TO LEAD TO MORE GOOD HABITS
HE KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE OF THE LEAST USE TO GO OUT AND BOLDLY ASK FOR SOME FOR IN THOSE HARD TIMES EVERYBODY WAS VERY VERY SELFISH
HE WAS STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN HE STARTED FOR HOME
I'D FLY WAY WAY UP IN THE BLUE BLUE SKY THE WAY OL MISTAH BUZZARD DOES WHERE I COULD LOOK DOWN AND SEE ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN THE GREEN FOREST AND ON THE GREEN MEADOWS
NOW MR PANTHER WAS HUNGRY FOR HE HAD FOUND NOTHING FOR HIS BREAKFAST THAT MORNING
THE ADVENTURES OF JERRY MUSKRAT 7
HE ACHED AND SMARTED TERRIBLY AND HIS LITTLE PLAIN BROWN COAT WAS TORN IN LONG STRIPS
I ALWAYS TAKE IT WITH ME WHEREVER I GO
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THAT AND IT WAS A SPLENDID STORY BUT WHEN HE LEARNED TO FLY HE FOUND THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE NEVER GIVES ALL HER BLESSINGS TO ANY SINGLE ONE OF HER LITTLE PEOPLE CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG WITHOUT PAYING THE LEAST ATTENTION TO PETER'S INTERRUPTION
NEITHER OF THEM KNEW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND AND BECAUSE THEY HADN'T ANYTHING BETTER TO DO THEY ALSO STARTED FOR THE SMILING POOL
OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO THAT AND UNC BILLY KNEW THEY COULDN'T FOR UNC BILLY'S MAMMY HAD DIED LONG BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT OF COMING UP FROM OL VIRGINNY TO THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS WHERE THEY LIVED
AFTER THAT HE COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BUT THE FACT THAT HE HADN'T ANY TAIL
BUT MR SKUNK DIDN'T MIND
I FIND IT MUCH THE HANDIEST WAY ILLUSTRATION
NOW ALTHOUGH MR FOX DIDN'T APPEAR TO TAKE ANY INTEREST IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS AND NEVER ASKED QUESTIONS HE HAD TWO OF THE SHARPEST EARS AMONG ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND WHILE HE WAS GOING ABOUT SEEMING TO BE JUST MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS HE WAS LISTENING AND LISTENING TO ALL THAT WAS SAID
HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY IT IS THAT BOBBY COON WEARS RINGS ON HIS TAIL
OLD MR CHIPMUNK WORE JUST A LITTLE PLAIN BROWN COAT
OF COURSE SHE SAW RIGHT AWAY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH OLD KING BEAR
ALL OF A SUDDEN MR FOX BECAME AWARE THAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT HIM AND IN EVERY FACE WAS HATE
IF HE WASN'T FEELING GOOD-NATURED IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO ASK HIM FOR A STORY
FACT IS HE DON NOTICE IT
SHE MADE THEM ALL PASS BEFORE HER AND SHE LOOKED SHARPLY AT EACH ONE AS THEY WENT BY
NOW THE VERY NIGHT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED MRS QUACK WHO LIVED ON THE RIVER BANK HAD A TERRIBLE FRIGHT
WHY EVEN LITTLE DANNY MEADOW MOUSE HAS A REAL TAIL SHORT AS IT IS
HA HA HA SHOUTED PETER DANCING ABOUT ON THE BANK
AT LAST TO GET RID OF HIM AND ENJOY A LITTLE QUIET AND PEACE GRANDFATHER FROG DID SO
SOME SHE PUNISHED ONE WAY AND SOME SHE PUNISHED ANOTHER WAY FOR OF COURSE SHE HADN'T BEEN TO BLAME FOR THE HARD TIMES BUT HAD BEEN WORKING NIGHT AND DAY TO PUT AN END TO THEM
IF I TELL YOU THE STORY PETER WILL BE SURE TO HEAR OF IT AND THEN HE WILL GIVE ME NO PEACE UNTIL I TELL IT TO HIM AND I DON'T LIKE TO TELL STORIES TWICE BUT HE IS HERE CRIED ONE OF THE LITTLE BREEZES
HE HAD FOUND OUT WHAT HE HAD WANTED TO KNOW BUT HE HADN'T HAD A STORY
ONE DAY OLD MOTHER NATURE FOUND MR MUSKRAT SITTING ON A ROCK LOOKING VERY MOURNFUL
BECAUSE HE HAD LITTLE USE FOR THEM HIS EYES GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND WHEN HE DID COME UP INTO THE LIGHT THEY HURT HIM SO THAT HE WAS GLAD TO GO BACK INTO THE DARK AGAIN
HE WENT TO WORK ON IT AT ONCE
YES SAID HE OLD MOTHER NATURE KNOWS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I DO BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN GIVING SAMMY JAY SUCH A HANDSOME COAT
WHEN IT DID THAT IT TICKLED THE CLAWS OF MR BOB CAT
OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED AS SHE SAID
HE GLANCED AT HIS COAT
BURGESS BEDTIME STORY-BOOKS 1
THEY WAITED AND WAITED BUT NO JERRY MUSKRAT
THE ADVENTURES OF BOB WHITE 20
THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES SAID MR FOX
MOTHER WEST WIND WHERE STORIES GREEN MEADOW SERIES 1
NOW SCAMPER HOME PETER RABBIT AND SEE THAT YOU DON'T LET OLD MAN COYOTE'S SHARP WITS GET YOU INTO TROUBLE THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG CRIED PETER AND SCAMPERED AS FAST AS HE COULD GO FOR THE DEAR SAFE OLD BRIAR-PATCH
I--I--LOVE THE WATER TOO WELL TO WANT TO STAY ON LAND ALL THE TIME SAID HE AND--AND--WELL I WAS PUT IN THE WATER IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I OUGHT TO BE CONTENTED WITH WHAT I HAVE GOT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS SO PLEASED WITH MR MUSKRAT'S REPLY THAT RIGHT AWAY SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A FINER HOUSE THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS SO SHE TOOK HIM OVER TO A QUIET LITTLE POOL WHERE THE WATER WAS NOT TOO DEEP AND SHE SHOWED HIM HOW TO BUILD A WONDERFUL HOUSE OF MUD AND RUSHES AND TWIGS WITH A NICE WARM BEDROOM LINED WITH GRASS ABOVE THE WATER AND AN ENTRANCE DOWN UNDER THE WATER SO THAT NO ONE EXCEPT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED MOST OF THE TIME IN THE WATER COULD POSSIBLY GET INTO IT
AFTER A TIME CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG THERE BEGAN TO BE MORE LAND AND STILL MORE
BE CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT I THINK I WILL SAID PETER
THERE WAS JOHNNY CHUCK WHO HAD TIPTOED UP AS SOFTLY AS HE KNEW HOW TO GIVE STRIPED CHIPMUNK A SCARE
WHEN THERE IS WORK FOR ME TO DO THE SOONER STARTED SOONER THROUGH SO EVERY MORNING THEY ASK HIM TO PLAY AND EVERY MORNING THEY LAUGH WHEN HE SAYS HE HAS TOO MUCH TO DO
AH KNOWS JES WHAT YO DONE GOT IN YOUR MIND BRER POSSUM SAID HE
HELLO JENNY SAID PETER
HAS GRANDFATHER FROG BEEN TELLING A STORY HE PANTED
THEY HAD TALKED IT OVER AND WONDERED AND WONDERED ABOUT IT AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND EVEN HAD ASKED UNC BILLY ABOUT IT
SO MR SNAKE FOUND THAT LYING HELPED HIM TO CHEAT AND STEAL AND ALL THE TIME HE KEPT THINKING HOW SMART HE WAS
PETER RABBIT OFTEN HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT
YOU SEE EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE ARRIVED YES SIR EVERYBODY WANTED TO LOOK HIS BEST
FROM THAT TIME HE BEGAN TO BE PARTICULAR VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT KEEPING HIMSELF CLEAN UNTIL FINALLY THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS OR IN THE GREEN FOREST QUITE SO NEAT AS MR COON
PETER IS NOT NATURALLY ENVIOUS
PETER LOOKED OVER AT JOHNNY CHUCK AND WINKED
HE HADN'T SAID A WORD TO ANY ONE ABOUT SPOTTY SO HOW COULD GRANDFATHER FROG KNOW WHAT HE HAD COME FOR
SHE SAID A LOT OF NICE THINGS TO HIM AND WHEN AT LAST SHE SENT HIM AWAY WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE HAD GIVEN HIM MORE RINGS CRIED PETER RABBIT
SAMMY CAME BY IT HONESTLY ENOUGH PETER
AS USUAL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD
CHUG-A-RUM BEGAN GRANDFATHER FROG SMOOTHING DOWN HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
FOOD WAS SCARCE AND KEPT GROWING MORE SCARCE
IT WAS JUST THE PLACE TO REST AND THINK
EVERYBODY ELSE HAD A TAIL AND HE HADN'T
JUST AS HE HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD DO THE DAM MADE A POND AND THE POND GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER UNTIL IT REACHED THE VERY PLACE WHERE HIS FOOD TREES GREW
WHAT EVER CAN I DO HE LAY THERE FEELING VERY HELPLESS AND MISERABLE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A THOUGHT CAME TO HIM
IT PAYS TO MAKE THE BEST OF WHAT WE HAVE DOESN'T IT IT CERTAINLY DOES
WHY NOT MAKE MR LYNX THINK HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS WITH HIM
HE WAS VERY POLITE TO MR PANTHER
LITTLE BY LITTLE HE GOT THE HABIT OF SLYLY FOLLOWING THEM WHEN THEY WERE HUNTING ALWAYS KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT
ONCE PETER OPENED HIS MOUTH TO ASK WHY BUT REMEMBERED IN TIME AND CLOSED IT AGAIN WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND
PRODUCED BY JULIET SUTHERLAND RICHARD J
THE FACT IS OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS LIKE ALL THE REST OF MR RABBIT'S NEIGHBORS--SHE JUST COULDN'T HELP LOVING HAPPY-GO-LUCKY MR RABBIT IN SPITE OF ALL HIS FAULTS
IN FACT HE HUNTED UP EVERY ONE HE COULD THINK OF AND SENT THEM TO CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND WITHOUT REALLY TELLING THEM SO HE MADE EACH ONE THINK THAT HE WOULD GET A SHARE IN THAT BREAKFAST NOW THERE WASN'T ANY MORE BREAKFAST THAN OLD KING BEAR WANTED HIMSELF AND BY THE TIME MR PANTHER ARRIVED THERE WASN'T SO MUCH AS A CRUMB LEFT
SHE POINTED A LONG FOREFINGER AT HIM AND SAID
HE KNOWS REPLIED OLD MR TOAD AND STARTED ON ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
BUT EVEN MR SNAKE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF CONSCIENCE AND ONCE IN A WHILE IT WOULD TROUBLE HIM
YES SIR THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH MR SNAKE
CERTAINLY I WOULDN'T GIVE SUCH A RASCAL AS SAMMY JAY ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST COATS IN ALL THE GREEN FOREST
MR RABBIT SNEEZED AND THIS MADE HIM WAKE UP
WHAT DO YOU WONDER HE REPEATED
SO IT IS REPLIED MR BEAVER STRETCHING FIRST ONE LEG AND THEN ANOTHER
YOU ASK FLITTER IF IT ISN'T SO PETER GRINNED
THEN SOME OF THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME ON THE LAND
NOW IF I DIG A HOLE AND KEEP OUT OF SIGHT I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MR WOLF OR ANYBODY ELSE CONTINUED MR MOLE TO HIMSELF
HE WENT OFF BY HIMSELF TO THINK THINGS OVER
THEN MR BAT HAD A VERY PLEASANT SURPRISE
THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT WITHOUT THE TROUBLE TO STEAL AND EVERYBODY WAS HONEST SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER TO BE HONEST THAN IT WAS TO BE DISHONEST
BUT HE IS TOO OLD AND TOO WISE TO LOSE HIS TEMPER FOR LONG OVER A JOKE ESPECIALLY WHEN HE HAS BEEN FAIRLY CAUGHT TRYING TO PLAY A JOKE HIMSELF
CHUG-A-RUM HE BEGAN AS HE ALWAYS DOES
THEN HE WASHED HIS FACE AND BRUSHED HIS COAT
IF IT HAD BEEN MR RATTLESNAKE OR MR GOPHERSNAKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
THE BIG GREEN LILY-PAD WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS NO ONE SITTING ON IT
AND EVER SINCE THAT LONG-AGO DAY ALL BEAVERS HAVE HAD BROAD TAILS AND HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST WORKERS IN THE WORLD END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF MOTHER WEST WIND WHY STORIES BY THORNTON W
OF COURSE PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK WERE NOT AFRAID OF HIM
BUT MR GREENSNAKE NEVER WINKED BACK
TOAD 13
IF HE HAD YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH
LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS OLD NEIGHBORS FORGOT ALL ABOUT HIM
THEN MR FOX KNEW THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND OUT AND HE SNEAKED AWAY WITH HIS TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS
HE JUST HAD TO KNOW
HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS AND HE NEVER WENT AROUND ASKING FOOLISH QUESTIONS OR POKING HIS NOSE INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS GRANDFATHER FROG STOPPED A MINUTE AND LOOKED VERY HARD AT PETER AFTER HE SAID THIS AND PETER LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE
SO WHEN PADDY THE BEAVER CAME TO LIVE IN THE GREEN FOREST AND MADE A POND THERE BY BUILDING A WONDERFUL DAM ACROSS THE LAUGHING BROOK THE FIRST THING PETER LOOKED TO SEE WAS WHAT KIND OF A TAIL PADDY HAS AND THE FIRST TIME HE GOT A GOOD LOOK AT IT HIS EYES POPPED ALMOST OUT OF HIS HEAD
HE WOULD SLEEP DAYS IN THE CAVE WHERE HE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AND COME OUT TO HUNT BUGS AND INSECTS JUST AS SOON AS MR HAWK HAD GONE TO BED
ONCE PETER THOUGHT ABOUT IT SO MUCH THAT GRANDFATHER FROG NOTICED HOW SOBER HE WAS AND ASKED PETER WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
GRANDFATHER FROG SCOWLED AT PETER
I BELIEVE SAID MR FISHER TALKING OUT LOUD TO HIMSELF THAT I'LL HAVE A LOOK AROUND THE SMILING POOL AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH THAT SLOW-MOVING TURTLE WHO LIVES THERE
OF COURSE THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TOLD PETER THAT OLD MAN COYOTE WAS ALL ALONE AND THEY BECAME VERY INDIGNANT WHEN PETER LAUGHED AT THEM
THEY ARE STRIPES OF HONOR REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG IN HIS DEEP GRUFF VOICE
HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN SO HE SCRAMBLED UP A TREE
THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE HE FELT THAT HE SIMPLY MUST KNOW AND THE ONLY WAY HE COULD FIND OUT WAS FROM GRANDFATHER FROG WHO IS VERY OLD AND VERY WISE
IT WAS A SPLENDID IDEA
BUT EVERYBODY HAD A TAIL OF SOME KIND
MR MUSKRAT LOOKED VERY MUCH ASHAMED AS HE FINALLY OWNED UP THAT HE WAS ENVIOUS OF HIS COUSINS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY HAD SUCH FINE HOUSES ON THE LAND
OLD MR POSSUM WAS VERY SYMPATHETIC AND SEEMED TO BE DOING HIS VERY BEST TO FIND THE LOST MEAL
YOU SEE PETER'S TAIL IS NOTHING BUT A FUNNY LITTLE BUNCH OF COTTON WHICH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A TAIL AT ALL
IF IT WAS IT WAS SO RIDICULOUSLY SMALL THAT PETER FELT THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF HIS OWN TAIL
I REALLY COULDN'T TELL WHETHER HE HAS A TAIL OR NOT REPLIED PETER QUITE TRUTHFULLY
THE FIRST CHANCE HE GOT HE WENT TO OLD MOTHER NATURE AND BEGGED HER TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS OLD COAT
IT WAS THEN THAT THE STRONGER BEGAN TO STEAL FROM THE WEAKER AND BY AND BY EVEN TO PREY UPON THOSE SMALLER THAN THEMSELVES
TRULY I DIDN'T STAMMERED PETER
HE WATCHED THOSE OF HIS NEIGHBORS WHO WERE FOREVER HURRYING ABOUT LOOKING FOR FOOD HURRYING BECAUSE ALL THE TIME THERE WAS GREAT FEAR UPON THEM THAT AN ENEMY MIGHT BE NEAR HURRYING BECAUSE EACH WAS FEARFUL THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD GET MORE THAN HE
BESIDES THEY SCRATCHED TERRIBLY
THEN MR COYOTE RETURNED TO THE DINNER MR LYNX HAD LEFT AND ATE AND ATE UNTIL HE COULDN'T HOLD ANOTHER MOUTHFUL
QUACK 17
HE JUST COULDN'T HELP IT
OF COURSE THAT MADE TROUBLE RIGHT AWAY BUT STILL NO ONE SUSPECTED MR SNAKE
HE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A GREAT DEAL BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO OLD MOTHER NATURE AND COMPLAINING AS MOST OF HIS NEIGHBORS WOULD HAVE DONE IN HIS PLACE HE STUDIED AND STUDIED TO FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE THE WORK EASIER
HE WORE JUST A COMMON EVERYDAY SUIT OF DULL BROWN LIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ABOUT HIM TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
CHUG-A-RUM RETORTED GRANDFATHER FROG
AND HE BELIEVED IN HELPING HIMSELF DID MR BEAVER AND NOT IN LEAVING EVERYTHING TO OLD MOTHER NATURE AS DID MOST OF HIS NEIGHBORS
A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK PETER
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY PETER RABBIT SAID HE SO THAT NEVER AGAIN WILL YOU BE LED TO DOUBT THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS ABOUT
JIMMY SKUNK
YOU REMEMBER THAT ONCE UPON A TIME LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG OLD KING BEAR RULED IN THE GREEN FOREST AND EVERYBODY BROUGHT TRIBUTE TO HIM PETER NODDED AND GRANDFATHER FROG WENT ON
HE MEANT TO HAVE HIS HOME LOOKING JUST AS FINE AS HE COULD MAKE IT
NOW MR RABBIT WAS LAZY
HE WAS STILL THINKING OF IT AS THE BLACK SHADOWS CAME CREEPING DOWN FROM THE PURPLE HILLS ACROSS THE GREEN MEADOWS
ONE DAY WORD CAME TO THE GREEN FOREST AND TO THE GREEN MEADOWS THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS COMING TO SEE HOW ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE WERE GETTING ALONG TO SETTLE ALL THE LITTLE TROUBLES AND FUSSES BETWEEN THEM AND TO FIND OUT WHO WERE AND WHO WERE NOT OBEYING THE ORDERS SHE HAD GIVEN THEM WHEN SHE HAD VISITED THEM LAST
MR BOB CAT GRINNED
SNAKE CANNOT WINK PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK WERE PLAYING TAG ON THE GREEN MEADOWS
ALL RIGHT REPLIED PETER HOPPING TO HIS FEET
WHY STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS PROUD OF HIS STRIPES II
IN FACT HE AND SAMMY ARE FOREVER FALLING OUT BECAUSE SAMMY DELIGHTS TO TEASE PETER
IT DIDN'T WORRY HIM A BIT NOT A BIT THAT HIS COAT WAS JUST PLAIN BROWN
MOTHER WEST WIND'S NEIGHBORS 5
REDDY FOX IS VERY SLY
FOR A LONG TIME HE LAY VERY STILL
HE GREW SO FAT THAT WHEN HE WALKED HE PUFFED AND WHEEZED
THEN WITH GREAT LEAPS HE CAME STRAIGHT FOR THE OLD STUMP ON WHICH LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK WAS SITTING
IT TICKLED HIM TO SEE HOW HARD IMPATIENT PETER WAS TRYING TO BE PATIENT AND HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES TWINKLED
IT'S JUST AS SURE AS A STOMACH-ACHE IS TO FOLLOW OVEREATING JUST HERE GRANDFATHER FROG PAUSED AND LOOKED VERY HARD AT PETER RABBIT
AT FIRST OLD MR BAT WHO WASN'T OLD THEN YOU KNOW HAD HARD WORK TO CATCH ENOUGH INSECTS BEFORE IT GREW TOO DARK BUT HE FOUND THAT EVERY NIGHT HE COULD SEE A LITTLE LONGER AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE NIGHT BEFORE UNTIL BY AND BY HE COULD SEE AS WELL IN THE DUSK AS HE USED TO SEE IN THE DAYTIME
THEY HURRY TO CALL ON HIM THE VERY FIRST THING EVERY MORNING AFTER OLD MOTHER WEST WIND HAS BROUGHT THEM DOWN FROM THE PURPLE HILLS
NO SIR OLD MR RABBIT WAS AFRAID OF WORK
AND SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHO TO WATCH OUT FOR FROM NOW ON NEVER TRUST THE ONE WHO WEARS A BRIGHT RED COAT CONCLUDED OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE THOUGHT HE COULD MAKE ALL THE TROUBLE HE PLEASED BY HIS DREADFUL CURIOSITY AND IF HE WAS FOUND OUT NO ONE WOULD SUFFER BUT HIMSELF
IT WAS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S LITTLE JOKES
BUT YO SEE OL JACK FROST TRY TO COME DOWN THERE SOMETIMES AN HE COOL THE AIR OFF A RIGHT SMART LOT BEFORE HE TURN TAIL AN RUN BACK WHERE HE BELONG
HE SAYS IT IS A WASTE OF ENERGY WHATEVER THAT MEANS I TELL YOU WHAT--LET'S GO OVER TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT IT NOW
IT WAS BRIGHT RED
THERE MUST BE A REASON SAID PETER GRAVELY AS HE PULLED THOUGHTFULLY AT ONE OF HIS LONG EARS
I WISH I HAD RINGS ON MY TAIL AND THEN HE WONDERED WHY EVERYBODY LAUGHED
NOW ALL THIS TIME OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD BEEN WATCHING MR TURTLE AND IT PLEASED HER TO SEE THAT HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO THINK OF SUCH A CLEVER WAY OF FOOLING HIS ENEMIES
BUT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE UP JUST BECAUSE HE WAS LAUGHED AT
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DIG YOU SEE MR MOLE ALWAYS HAD BEEN VERY FOND OF DIGGING AND HE HAD DONE SO MUCH OF IT THAT HIS FRONT LEGS AND CLAWS HAD GROWN VERY STOUT
I BELIEVE HE WOULD HAVE EATEN ME IF I HADN'T CRAWLED INTO AN OLD HOLLOW STUMP
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SLY AND HE PLAYED A GREAT MANY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AND SOMETIMES HE GOT THEM INTO TROUBLE
HE LISTEN AN LISTEN
FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD HAD A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR GRANDFATHER FROG WHO AS YOU KNOW IS VERY OLD AND VERY WISE BUT NOW PETER FELT ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM
WHEN HE GOT READY TO GO ON HIS WAY HE FOUND THAT THE PIECE OF BARK HAD CAUGHT ON HIS BACK AND THAT HE WAS CARRYING IT WITH HIM
I SEE SAID HE THAT YOU WILL HAVE A STORY AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE SOONER I TELL IT TO YOU THE SOONER YOU WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE
OLD KING BEAR PUT ON HIS BLACKEST COAT
AS HE SAYS HE IS ALWAYS AT HOME
STRIPED CHIPMUNK JOHNNY CHUCK JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE LOOKED AS THOUGH THEY FELT VERY FOOLISH AS INDEED THEY DID
THEN MR COYOTE BEGAN TO RUN IN A CIRCLE AROUND MR LYNX ALWAYS KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT IN THE THICK BRUSH AND EVERY FEW STEPS HE YELPED OR HOWLED AND EACH YELP OR HOWL HE TRIED TO MAKE SOUND DIFFERENT
BUT AS SHE WATCHED HIM SITTING THERE DREAMING IN THE WARM SUNSHINE HER ANGER BEGAN TO MELT AWAY
BUT WHAT GRANDFATHER FROG ASKED PETER EAGERLY WHEN HE COULD KEEP STILL NO LONGER
NO SOONER DID HE BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT FLITTER THE BAT THAN HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING ELSE
NOW OL MISTAH BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD-NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BEGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
IT WAS VERY USEFUL WHEN HE WAS SWIMMING BUT IT WAS OF NO USE AT ALL AT ANY OTHER TIME
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY POLITE TO EVERY ONE AND ALWAYS OFFERING TO DO FAVORS FOR HIS NEIGHBORS
OLD MR POSSUM HIMSELF HURRIED ON CHUCKLING AS HE THOUGHT OF THE WAY MR PANTHER WAS LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED WITH OLD KING BEAR IN SUCH A TEMPER
SO MR SKUNK GREW VERY INDEPENDENT AND WENT WHERE HE PLEASED WHEN HE PLEASED
I'VE ASKED HIM FOR SO MANY STORIES THAT I DON'T DARE ASK FOR ANOTHER RIGHT AWAY FOR FEAR THAT HE WILL SAY THAT I AM A NUISANCE SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES SHOULD ASK GRANDFATHER FROG WHY IT IS THAT JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES AND THAT PETER SHOULD KEEP OUT OF SIGHT UNTIL GRANDFATHER FROG HAD BEGUN THE STORY FOR THEY WERE SURE THAT THERE WOULD BE A STORY
THEN SHE TOUCHED THE SKIN OF HIS STOMACH AND TURNED THAT INTO HARD SHELL
GRANDFATHER FROG DIDN'T ANSWER
A PRETTY KIND OF A KING HE IS SNEERED MR FOX
THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG CRIED THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
NOW YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS IS THE THING THAT YOU TRY AND TRY TO FIND OUT AND CAN'T FIND OUT THAT YOU MOST WANT TO FIND OUT
HE WOULD MAKE NO REPLY SAVE TO RUN OUT HIS TONGUE AT THEM PETER WAS THINKING OF THIS AS HE AND JOHNNY CHUCK STRETCHED OUT IN A SUNNY SPOT TO GET THEIR BREATH AND REST
YES SIR HE WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST TO DEATH
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING ELSE TO DO LET'S GO DOWN TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG
PRESENTLY GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT TWO OR THREE TIMES AND BEGAN TO TALK
MR BEAVER GRINNED
IT IS OLD MAN COYOTE ALONE WHO MAKES ALL THAT NOISE DON'T YOU SUPPOSE I KNOW WHAT I HEAR DEMANDED PETER
MY MY MY SUCH A HURRYING AND SCURRYING AND WORRYING AS THERE WAS
WHO IS IT SOMETIMES LOUDLY THUMPS
NOW AS I SAID BEFORE MR MOLE NEVER HAD MEDDLED WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND HE DIDN'T NOW
THE ONLY THING HE COULD DO WAS TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE HAS LEARNED BETTER OH SAID ONE OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES IN A RATHER FAINT DISAPPOINTED SORT OF VOICE
IF I AM GOING TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT TO-DAY I SHALL HAVE TO HURRY THOUGHT HE
BOBBY COON'S TAIL IS VERY HANDSOME YOU KNOW
HE SAID IT JUST TO TEASE THEM AND WHEN HE SAID IT HE CHUCKLED UNTIL THEY CHUCKLED TOO JUST AS IF IT REALLY WERE THE BEST KIND OF A JOKE
AN FROM THAT DAY HIS HAID AN NECK STAY BLACK AN HE NEVER SPEAK LESSEN HE SPOKEN TO AN THEN HE ONLY GRUNT
PLEASE MR BUZZARD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BEGGED
WHY FLITTER THE BAT FLIES AT NIGHT XV
IT WAS THE FACT THAT BUSTER BEAR SEEMED TO HAVE NO TAIL
IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WHY DOESN'T MR GREENSNAKE WINK AT US WHEN WE WINK AT HIM HE ASKED
IN THAT WAY HE NEVER MISSED ANY OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT HIS HURRYING WORRYING NEIGHBORS DID
THEY ALWAYS BEG HIM TO STOP AND PLAY WITH THEM BUT OFTEN HE REFUSES
BUT PRESENTLY MR TURTLE DISCOVERED THAT THE BIG PEOPLE WERE EATING THE LITTLE PEOPLE WHENEVER THEY COULD CATCH THEM AND THAT HE WASN'T SAFE A MINUTE WHEN ON SHORE AND NOT ALWAYS SAFE IN THE WATER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG
AFTER THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT AS IF TO BEGIN BUT FOR A LONG TIME HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IT IS VERY IMPOLITE TO DISTURB PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE HAVING A NAP I--I'M VERY SORRY
NOW YOU ALL KNOW HOW FULL OF CURIOSITY PETER RABBIT IS
BUT ONE THING MR MOLE NEVER DID
LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK WAS FRIGHTENED ALMOST TO DEATH
OF COURSE REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH PUT OUT AT SUCH A FOOLISH QUESTION
ONE DAY AS HE SAT ON AN OLD LOG WITH HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS THINKING ABOUT HIS TAIL WHO SHOULD COME ALONG BUT OLD MOTHER NATURE
CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT ANY ONE REALLY LIVES HERE THEN PEERING THROUGH THE TANGLE OF BRAMBLES SHE SPIED OLD MR RABBIT SITTING ON HIS BROKEN-DOWN DOORSTEP WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND FAST ASLEEP
WHY EVEN THAT LITTLE UPSTART MR RABBIT HAS GOT A MAKE-BELIEVE TAIL GRANDFATHER FROG'S EYES TWINKLED AS HE SAID THIS AND PETER LOOKED VERY MUCH EMBARRASSED
THEN EVERYBODY BEGAN TO FIX UP THEIR HOMES AND MAKE THEM AS NEAT AND NICE AS THEY KNEW HOW--EVERYBODY BUT MR RABBIT
I BELIEVE HE'LL MAKE ME A GOOD DINNER OF COURSE MR TURTLE HEARD JUST WHAT HE SAID AND HE BLESSED THE PIECE OF BARK WHICH HAD HIDDEN HIM FROM MR FISHER'S SIGHT
SO SHE BEGAN TO STUDY HOW SHE COULD HELP MR TURTLE
NOW WHY DO YOU GO OVER TO THE SWEET-CLOVER PATCH EVERY DAY WHY BECAUSE THERE IS PLENTY TO EAT THERE REPLIED PETER LOOKING VERY VERY MUCH PUZZLED
ALL HE COULD THINK OF WAS THAT GREAT BROAD FLAT THICK TAIL WHICH IS SO UNLIKE ANY TAIL HE HAD EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF
MR BEAVER HAD DISCOVERED WHAT A DAM IS FOR AND HOW TO BUILD IT
OH DEAR OH DEAR
SOMEHOW THE SMILING POOL DIDN'T SEEM QUITE LIKE ITSELF WITHOUT GRANDFATHER FROG SITTING THERE WATCHING FOR FOOLISH GREEN FLIES
MERCY ME EXCLAIMED OLD MOTHER NATURE THROWING UP HER HANDS AS SHE SAW THE TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE BRAMBLES AND WEEDS
THEN OF COURSE GRANDFATHER FROG KNOWS IT SAID PETER
AND THIS VOICE WAS VERY WONDERFUL FOR IT SOUNDED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE MANY VOICES ALL YELPING AND HOWLING AT THE SAME TIME
THAT HE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE HAPPY UNLESS HE HAD A TAIL
YOU WOULDN'T IF YOU HAD TO WEAR IT FOR THE SAME REASON THAT REDDY FOX HAS TO WEAR HIS
THEN WAS MR BEAVER VERY HAPPY AND TO SHOW HOW HAPPY HE WAS HE WORKED HARDER THAN EVER
HE CERTAINLY HAS THOUGHT MR LYNX BUT I'M A MATCH FOR TWO OF THEM AND ONCE MORE HE WENT ON EATING
LIKE HIS SMALL COUSIN MR MUSKRAT HE WAS VERY FOND OF THE WATER AND FELT MOST AT HOME AND SAFEST THERE
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T UNTIL OLD MOTHER NATURE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT BLACK SUIT TO GET INTO MISCHIEF ON DARK NIGHTS THAT SHE GAVE HIM WHITE STRIPES SO THAT THE DARKER THE NIGHT THE HARDER IT WOULD BE FOR HIM TO KEEP FROM BEING SEEN
CAN'T CRIED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK TOGETHER
HIS EARS TOLD HIM THAT THERE WERE MANY VOICES BUT HIS EYES TOLD HIM THAT ALL THAT DREADFUL SOUND WAS COMING OUT OF ONE MOUTH
AND HE NEVER HURRIED BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT IT PAID BEST TO GO SLOWLY
AT LAST HE REALLY DID BEGIN AND THE VERY FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO ASK PETER A QUESTION
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE HE CONFESSED BUT I NEVER WASTE TIME WISHING FOR THINGS I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET AND WENT RIGHT ON CUTTING
THE ADVENTURES OF PETER COTTONTAIL 4
THEN VERY SLOWLY HE TURNED HIS BACK ON THE SMILING POOL AND STARTED TO HOP AWAY
CHUG-A-RUM SAID HE IN HIS DEEP VOICE
SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE MR COON AND ASKED HIM ALL ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS JUST AS IF SHE DIDN'T KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM ALREADY
AT LAST SHE GOT UP TO GO AND HER EYES TWINKLED MORE THAN EVER AS SHE SAID
HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE KNEW ENOUGH NOT TO APPEAR SMART AND THE FACT IS HIS NEIGHBORS THOUGHT HIM RATHER DULL
AS THERE GOT TO BE MORE AND MORE LAND MORE AND MORE OF THE ANIMALS LEFT THE WATER UNTIL FINALLY MOST OF THEM WERE SPENDING NEARLY ALL OF THE TIME ON LAND
BUT IN SPITE OF THIS IT NEVER SEEMED TO HIM QUITE RIGHT THAT SAMMY JAY SHOULD BE SO HANDSOMELY DRESSED
THE ADVENTURES OF UNC BILLY POSSUM 5
IN FACT MR SNAKE WAS VERY WELL LIKED AND MUCH RESPECTED
NOW ABOUT THIS TIME HARD TIMES CAME TO ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS
HE HAD FELT A GREAT MANY TIMES THAT HE JUST COULDN'T HELP THIS HABIT OF POKING THAT WOBBLY LITTLE NOSE OF HIS IN WHERE IT HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE ANY MORE THAN HE COULD CHANGE THAT FUNNY LITTLE BUNCH OF WHITE COTTON WHICH HE CALLED A TAIL FOR A REALLY TRULY TAIL
WHEN HE GOT OUTSIDE HE FOUND THAT MR SUN HAD GONE TO BED
OH THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED PETER DRAWING A LONG BREATH
NOW OF COURSE OLD MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T LIKE THIS AND TO PUNISH THEM SHE SAID THAT THEY SHOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE WATER EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO
SHE HAD ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE COME BEFORE HER IN TURN AND TELL THEIR TROUBLES
GOOD MORNING MOTHER NATURE HE REPLIED IN HIS POLITEST MANNER WHICH WAS VERY POLITE INDEED
IT IS THAT WAY WITH PETER RABBIT
SPOTTY WAS STILL THERE WHEN PETER RETURNED A LONG TIME AFTER AND HE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF HE HAD MOVED
THE FACT IS I--I YOU WANT A STORY FINISHED GRANDFATHER FROG FOR HIM
PETER RABBIT HAD SEEN HIM WHEN HE WENT BY ON HIS WAY TO THE LAUGHING BROOK AND THE GREEN FOREST TO LOOK FOR SOME ONE TO PASS THE TIME OF DAY WITH
NO SIR HE WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED YOU
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WAS TIRED SO HE CURLED UP AT THE BOTTOM FOR A NAP
I MET MR WOLF THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SUCH A HUNGRY LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT IT GAVE ME THE COLD SHIVERS
YOU SEE HE DIDN'T NOTICE THAT GRANDFATHER FROG WAS LISTENING WHEN HE ASKED SPOTTY ABOUT HIS HOUSE
YOU SEE ALL THEIR LIVES MINER THE MOLE HAD BEEN ONE OF THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS AND YET THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT HIM
WHEN DANGER'S NEAR WHO RUNS AWAY WILL LIVE TO RUN ANOTHER DAY RETORTED PETER PROMPTLY
NO WONDER HE IS SO SLOW
OLD MR POSSUM TOLD HIM THE SAME STORY HE HAD TOLD MR PANTHER AND MR LYNX WENT BOUNDING OFF IN A TERRIBLE HURRY FOR FEAR THAT HE WOULD NOT BE IN TIME TO SHARE IN THAT GOOD BREAKFAST
HAPPY JACK NOTICED IT
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW NOW HE DEMANDED BEFORE PETER COULD FAIRLY GET HIS BREATH
OLD MR BAT HAD WINGS
VII WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK HAD GONE DOWN TO THE SMILING POOL FOR A CALL ON THEIR OLD FRIEND JERRY MUSKRAT
SO HIS BROWN AND GRAY COAT ALWAYS WAS RUMPLED AND TUMBLED AND DIRTY
IT WAS HARD VERY HARD TO BELIEVE BUT IT WAS SO
HIS EYES GREW YELLOWER AND YELLOWER HE DREW HIS LIPS BACK FROM HIS LONG SHARP TEETH IN A VERY ANGRY WAY AND HIS LITTLE BOB TAIL TWITCHED AND TWITCHED
AT FIRST HE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE FOUND THAT IT WAS VERY HARD WORK TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT WHEN HE WANTED TO
PRESENTLY THE DARK FORM CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE BLACK SHADOWS WHERE PETER COULD SEE IT CLEARLY SAT DOWN POINTED A SHARP NOSE UP AT THE FIRST TWINKLING LITTLE STARS OPENED A BIG MOUTH AND OUT OF IT POURED SUCH A YELPING AND HOWLING AS MADE PETER SHIVER WITH FRIGHT
SO IT IS BRER RABBIT
BUT HE FOUND THAT SOMETIMES THE FOOD WHICH HE LIKED BEST WHICH WAS THE BARK OF CERTAIN KINDS OF TREES GREW SOME DISTANCE FROM THE WATER AND IT WAS THE HARDEST KIND OF HARD WORK TO ROLL AND DRAG THE LOGS DOWN TO THE WATER WHERE HE COULD EAT THE BARK FROM THEM IN SAFETY
THAT MADE HIM THINK HARDER THAN EVER
MR COON AND MR MINK AND MR OTTER SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT BRUSHING THEIR SUITS AND MAKING THEM LOOK AS FINE AND HANDSOME AS THEY COULD
SOMETIMES HE TRIED TO BRACE HIMSELF WITH IT--WHEN HE WAS SITTING UP TO CUT TREES AND FOUND IT OF NO HELP
HE TOLD HER THAT HE HAD AND EXPLAINED WHY
HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT AND THEN TOOK THE SHORTEST WAY HOME
SOME PEOPLE NEVER DO LEARN TO USE THEIR EYES PETER LOOKED A BIT SHEEPISH BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND WAITED PATIENTLY
THE ONLY TIME HE EVER SEES IT IS WHEN HE IS BACK TO THE SMILING POOL AND LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HIS REFLECTION IN THE WATER AND THEN OF COURSE HE REALLY DOESN'T SEE HIS TAIL ITSELF
GRANDFATHER FROG SAT JUST AS USUAL ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND HE GRINNED WHEN HE SAW WHO HIS VISITORS WERE FOR HE GUESSED RIGHT AWAY WHAT THEY HAD COME FOR
THE MORE HE TRIED NOT TO THINK OF THESE TAILS THE MORE HE DID THINK OF THEM
IN FACT HE WAS RATHER PLEASED THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE A TAIL
BUT ALL HE HEAR IS JES A MUMBLING AND A MUMBLING AN THAT MAKE HIM MORE CURIOUS THAN EVER
IS BUZZARD REALLY YOUR FAM'LY NAME ASKED UNC BILLY
THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEFORE THIS IF YOU HAD HAD A LONG TAIL STICKING OUT BEHIND FOR THEM TO GET HOLD OF
WHY DIDN'T WE THINK OF HIM BEFORE EXCLAIMED THE OTHERS
FOR A WHILE HE WAS CONTENT TO CATCH WHAT HE COULD WITHOUT DANGER TO HIMSELF AND TO EAT WHAT HIS BIGGER AND STRONGER NEIGHBORS LEFT WHEN THEY HAPPENED TO GET MORE THAN THEY WANTED FOR THEMSELVES
OH GRANDFATHER FROG PLEASE DO TELL US WHY IT IS THAT STRIPED CHIPMUNK HAS SUCH BEAUTIFUL STRIPES ON HIS COAT BEGGED ONE OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW SPOKE UP ONE OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
AT NIGHT HE WOULD GO HOME AND CHUCKLE OVER HIS SMARTNESS
THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN HIS EYES THOUGH PETER DIDN'T SEE IT
IF I HAVE ANY MORE INTERRUPTIONS THERE WILL BE NO STORY TO-DAY SAID HE SEVERELY
AN THAT IS THE REASON THAT MAH COUSIN WHO LIVES DOWN SOUF DONE HAVE A BLACK HAID CONCLUDED OL MISTAH BUZZARD
OF COURSE BIG MR BOB CAT LOOKED UP RIGHT AWAY AND SAW LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK SITTING ON THE OLD STUMP
THE ADVENTURES OF GRANDFATHER FROG 9
JOHNNY GRINNED
IF I COULD MAKE MYSELF INTO THREE WE COULD TAKE THAT DINNER AWAY FROM MR LYNX THOUGHT HE AND RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT THOUGHT CAME A GREAT IDEA
SO HE HAD PLENTY TO EAT FROM THAT TIME ON
I GUESS OLD MOTHER NATURE MAKES NO MISTAKES AND ALWAYS KNOWS JUST WHAT SHE IS DOING CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG IN HIS DEEPEST VOICE
THEN HE WOULD CRAWL UNDER THE PIECE OF BARK AND GET IT ON HIS BACK
IT SEEM TO HIM THAT HE MUST GO CLEAN OUTEN HIS HAID LESS HE HEAR WHAT GOING ON DOWN INSIDE THAT LIL OL HOUSE
UP THEY HOPPED AND RACED OVER TO THE GRASSY TUSSOCK WHERE MR GREENSNAKE LAY BUT TO ALL THEIR QUESTIONS HE WOULD MAKE NO REPLY SAVE TO RUN OUT HIS TONGUE AT THEM
IT WASN'T LIKE ANY TAIL HE HAD EVER SEEN OR HEARD OF
HALF WAY THERE HE PAUSED SAW THAT THE WAY TO THE SMILING POOL WAS CLEAR AND SUDDENLY MADE UP HIS MIND TO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG ABOUT BUSTER BEAR'S TAIL
HIS THROAT WAS VERY RAW AND SORE BECAUSE HE HAD STRAINED IT TRYING TO MAKE HIS VOICE CHANGE SO OFTEN BUT HE DIDN'T MIND THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT FELT SO GOOD TO HAVE ALL HE COULD EAT AT ONE TIME ONCE MORE
FOR A LONG TIME EVERYBODY LIVED AT PEACE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WE WANT TO KNOW WHY IT IS THAT UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD REPLIED PETER AS POLITELY AS HE KNEW HOW
AND YET HE LIKED THE SAME THINGS TO EAT
NOW THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND OUT OF COURSE EVERY ONE WAS ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND IT WASN'T SO EASY TO STEAL AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
HE HOPED HE WOULD FIND GRANDFATHER FROG SITTING AS USUAL ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND THAT HE WOULD BE GOOD-NATURED
A KINDLY DEED'S MOST KINDLY DONE IN SECRET WROUGHT AND SEEN OF NONE
MY GOODNESS
I DON'T SEE ANY ANYWHERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF
CHUG-A-RUM GRUNTED GRANDFATHER FROG CROSSLY
BUT THERE CAME A TIME WHEN FOOD WAS SCARCE AND IT WAS NO LONGER EASY TO GET PLENTY TO EAT
IF HE DID HAPPEN TO BE FOUND NEAR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE HE ALWAYS HAD A STORY READY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS PRESENCE AND IT SOUNDED SO TRUE AND HE TOLD IT IN SUCH AN HONEST MANNER THAT NO ONE THOUGHT OF DOUBTING IT
NOW THE LIL OL WOMAN WHAT LIVED BY HERSELF IN THAT LIL OL TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE HADN'T SEEN THAT NO COUNT BUZZARD LIGHT ON THE CHIMNEY FO TO WARM HIS TOES AN WHEN SHE HEAR THAT VOICE COMING RIGHT OUTEN THE FIREPLACE SHE WAS SOME FLUSTRATED AND SCARED WAS THAT LIL OL WOMAN
BY ATTENDING STRICTLY TO MY OWN BUSINESS I HAVE NO TIME TO MEDDLE WITH THE AFFAIRS OF MY NEIGHBORS AND SO I KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE SAID OLD MR CHIPMUNK JUST WHAT STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAYS NOW BROKE IN ONE OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE BUT NOW THAT HE HAD NOTICED IT HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT HE EVER HAD SEEN LITTLE MR GREENSNAKE WINK NOR ANY OF MR GREENSNAKE'S RELATIVES
SO IT IS OL MISTAH BUZZARD HASTENED TO SAY
BUT HIS HEART NEVER DID CHANGE AND HIS CHILDREN AND HIS CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WERE JUST LIKE HIM
NOW DRAW IN YOUR HEAD AND YOUR LEGS AND YOUR TAIL SAID SHE
YOU SEE IT SEEMED TO PETER AS IF GRANDFATHER FROG HAD READ HIS VERY THOUGHTS
HIS EYES WERE YELLOW AND A HUNGRY LOOK WAS IN THEM
THEN MR COYOTE HURRIED AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF MR LYNX ALL THE TIME KEEPING OUT OF SIGHT AND HOWLED AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE TRIED TO MAKE HIS VOICE SOUND DIFFERENT
THE ADVENTURES OF PADDY THE BEAVER 16
BUT NOW AS HE LOOKED AT THIS ONE IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN MINER THE MOLE MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN ALL HIS LIFE
PETER HAS SUCH A FUNNY LITTLE TAIL HIMSELF JUST A LITTLE WHITE BUNCH OF COTTON THAT SUCH A HANDSOME TAIL AS BOBBY COON'S SOMETIMES STIRS JUST A WEE BIT OF ENVY IN PETER'S HEART
WHY SAID HE EVERY NIGHT I HEAR A WHOLE CROWD YELPING AND HOWLING TOGETHER BUT YOU DON'T INSISTED THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
MR COYOTE FOLLOWED HIM STILL TRYING TO MAKE HIS VOICE SOUND LIKE THE VOICES OF MANY
PETER SAT STILL AND TRIED NOT TO SHOW HOW IMPATIENT HE FELT
SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW HAVE VERY MODEST COATS
THEY DUG DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF HIS HOLE AND THEN BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FIND HIM THERE THEY STRAIGHTWAY FELL TO QUARRELING EACH BLAMING THE OTHER FOR SUGGESTING SUCH A LOT OF HARD WORK FOR NOTHING
LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK GRINNED AS WELL AS HE COULD FOR THE PAIN
YOU CAN'T FOOL OLD MOTHER NATURE AND IT IS OF NO USE TO TRY
THE VERY SIGHT OF WORK SCARED OLD MR RABBIT
YOU WILL NEVER WINK AGAIN FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN FOREVER WILL HAVE NO EYELIDS THAT ALL THE WORLD MAY KNOW THAT THOSE WHO MAKE A WRONG USE OF THE THINGS GIVEN THEM SHALL HAVE THEM TAKEN AWAY AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY LITTLE MR GREENSNAKE CANNOT WINK AT YOU
I GUESS I'D BETTER BE GETTING HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH NOW
GRANDFATHER FROG WAS SITTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD IN THE WARM SUNSHINE AND FOR ONCE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY
SEEMS TO ME I CAN SMELL HIM NOW
HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF MR MEADOW MOUSE DID LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK
HAPPY JACK WATCHED HIM GO AND THERE WAS A PUZZLED LOOK IN HAPPY JACK'S EYES
AFTER THAT ALL MR COYOTE HAD TO DO WHEN HE WANTED TO FRIGHTEN SOME ONE BIGGER AND STRONGER THAN HIMSELF WAS TO OPEN HIS MOUTH AND SEND FORTH HIS NEW VOICE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE MANY VOICES
MR COON LOOKED A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN RATHER ASHAMED OF THE FUNNY LITTLE ONE HE HAS HIMSELF
NO SOONER DID PETER POP HIS HEAD ABOVE THE EDGE OF THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL THAN GRANDFATHER FROG EXCLAIMED
THEY JUST SNARLED AT HIM AND PASSED WITHOUT OFFERING TO TOUCH HIM
HE HASN'T ANY EYELIDS TO WINK WITH FINISHED GRANDFATHER FROG
SO HE THANKED OLD MR POSSUM AND HURRIED AWAY TO FIND OLD KING BEAR AND SHARE IN THE GOOD THINGS OLD MR POSSUM HAD TOLD ABOUT
UNC BILLY POSSUM WHO IS OL MISTAH BUZZARD'S PARTICULAR FRIEND BOTH HAVING COME FROM WAY DOWN SOUF HAPPENED ALONG JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE END OF IT
HE BROUGHT UP SOME CLEAN YELLOW SAND FROM DEEP DOWN IN THE GROUND AND SPRINKLED IT SMOOTHLY OVER HIS DOORSTEP
AGAIN HE LOST HIS APPETITE AND GREW CROSS AND PEEVISH SO THAT NO ONE DARED COME NEAR HIM
I WISH I COULD FLY
THEY SPOILED HIS SUPPER
NO SIR MR MOLE NEVER POKED HIS NOSE IN WHERE HE HAD NO BUSINESS
FINALLY SHE GAVE HIM ONE
AND NO MORE CAN MR BLACKSNAKE OR MR RATTLESNAKE OR MR GOPHERSNAKE OR ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY WHY NOT CRIED PETER AND JOHNNY ALL IN THE SAME BREATH
I--I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE WAITING
HE FIDGETED ABOUT AND LOOKED VERY HARD AT GRANDFATHER FROG BUT THE LATTER SEEMED TO THINK THAT HE HAD TOLD PETER WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW AND THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS TO IT
JENNY WREN WAS RIGHT
AND THEN BECAUSE THE SUN WAS BRIGHT AND WARM AND HE WAS VERY VERY COMFORTABLE OLD MR RABBIT BEGAN TO NOD AND PRESENTLY HE WAS FAST ASLEEP
THEN HE REALIZED THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD ONCE MORE BEEN VERY GOOD TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD HELPED HIM JUST AS SHE ALWAYS HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES
ONE DAY SHE CAME UP BEHIND HIM JUST AS HE SAT DOWN TO REST
AT FIRST THEY ONLY LAUGHED BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY FOUND THAT QUITE OFTEN THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO BE AT HOME IN THE WATER AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN
THIS IS WHAT I GET FOR MEDDLING IN THE AFFAIRS OF OTHER FOLKS SAID LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK BITTERLY
ONCE UPON A TIME LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG LIVED OLD MR SNAKE THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF LITTLE MR GREENSNAKE AND ALL THE OTHER SNAKES WHOM YOU KNOW
SO NOW INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT OPENLY WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH HE GREW VERY CRAFTY AND SNEAKED QUIETLY ABOUT THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST TRYING TO KEEP OUT OF SIGHT THAT HE MIGHT THE EASIER STEAL FROM HIS NEIGHBORS AND MAKE TROUBLE FOR THEM
AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM A VERY LONG TIME GRANDFATHER FROG SWALLOWED THE LEGS OF THE LAST FOOLISH GREEN FLY OPENED HIS BIG MOUTH AND BEGAN
THEN HE REACHED IN A LITTLE FARTHER AND MADE A GRAB FOR LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK
THAT LOOKS TO ME LIKE PRETTY HARD WORK SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
INSTEAD OF HURRYING HOME AND GETTING TO WORK HIMSELF MR RABBIT STOPPED A WHILE AFTER EACH CALL AND SAT WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED WATCHING THE ONE HE WAS CALLING ON WORK
SHIFFER AND THE PG ONLINE DISTRIBUTED PROOFREADING TEAM
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK PETER RABBIT PETER SCRATCHED ONE LONG EAR AND THEN THE OTHER LONG EAR THOUGHTFULLY AND HE LOOKED A WEE BIT ASHAMED AS HE REPLIED
PETER RABBIT DREW A LONG BREATH
PETER RABBIT DREW A LONG BREATH
THAT WOULD LOOK AS IF HE WERE UNGRATEFUL FOR HER KINDNESS IN GIVING HIM THE WINGS
I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT THAT WAS SOME OF YOUR WORK PETER RABBIT SAID HE BUT I THOUGHT IT SURELY WAS A STONE THROWN BY FARMER BROWN'S BOY
HE KEPT HIMSELF AS NEAT AS EVER AND WAS ALWAYS CHEERFUL
WHO FOLDS HIS ARMS WITH WORK UNDONE DOTH CHEAT HIMSELF AND SPOIL HIS FUN HEREAFTER MR RABBIT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO SIT WITH FOLDED ARMS UNTIL YOU OR THEY HAVE LEARNED TO WORK AND THAT IS WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS ARMS AND STILL LIVES IN A TUMBLE-DOWN HOUSE AMONG THE BRAMBLES CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
THAT SHE LEFT AS A REMINDER LEST HE SHOULD FORGET THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNED AND SHOULD AGAIN GROW ENVIOUS
NO SIR MR COON JUST STUCK TO HIS HOME AND DID THE BEST HE COULD TO FIND ENOUGH TO EAT
I WONDER WHAT SHE MEANT BY REWARD
NOW GRANDFATHER FROG IS VERY OLD AND VERY WISE AND HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND X
HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW STRIPED CHIPMUNK HADN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO DO SO OFF THEY STARTED
YES REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG MR COON'S TAIL WAS RINGED WAY TO THE TIP
FINALLY PETER SIGHED AND IT WAS SUCH A HEAVY SIGH
PETER CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING-PLACE LOOKING RATHER SHAMEFACED AND VERY FOOLISH
YOU SEE HE CONTINUED AS SOON AS HE FOUND THAT OUT HE BEGAN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND CHEAT THEM BUT HE WOULD DO IT SO SMOOTHLY THAT THEY NEVER ONCE SUSPECTED THAT THEY WERE BEING CHEATED
HIS NEW TAIL WAS JUST THE MOST SPLENDID BRACE
HE WORKED VERY HARD AND VERY FAST AND BY THE TIME MR BADGER AND MR FOX RETURNED MR MOLE WAS AT THE END OF A LONG TUNNEL SO FAR FROM THE HOLE HE HAD FIRST DUG THAT HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM A LONG TIME TO DIG HIM OUT EVEN IF THEY NOTICED HIS TUNNEL
ANYWAY AS I SAID BEFORE THE IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO BE IN OLD MR POSSUM'S HEAD THAT MORNING FOR HE BEGAN TO PLAY TRICKS ON HIS NEIGHBORS AS SOON AS THEY WERE OUT OF BED
THEN ALONG CAME OLD MOTHER NATURE TO SEE HOW THINGS WERE GOING IN THE GREEN FOREST
WHEN SHE ASKED HIM WHAT THE MATTER WAS HE WAS ASHAMED TO TELL HER AT FIRST
HE LOOKED AT THE PIECE OF BARK UNDER WHICH MR TURTLE WAS HIDING BUT ALL HE SAW WAS THE BARK BECAUSE YOU KNOW MR TURTLE HAD DRAWN HIMSELF WHOLLY UNDER
NOTHING THAT SHE COULD SAY MADE ANY DIFFERENCE--HE WANTED A TAIL
BUT HE DIDN'T LOSE INTEREST IN TAILS AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IN WONDERING WHY SOME OF HIS NEIGHBORS HAD BIG BUSHY TAILS AND SOME HAD LONG SLIM TAILS AND WHY HE HIMSELF HAD ALMOST NO TAIL AT ALL
IT SEEMED THAT HE WAS JUST BORN TO BE CURIOUS AND SO OF COURSE TO GET INTO TROUBLE
HE HAD JUST SEEN BUSTER BEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHAT DO YOU THINK HAD IMPRESSED HIM MOST
AND IF HE COULD HAVE LAID HANDS ON OLD MR POSSUM THAT MINUTE IT SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIM
SHE COULDN'T SEE THAT MR BEAR HAD THE LEAST NEED OF A TAIL AND SO SHE HADN'T GIVEN HIM ONE
NOW OLD MOTHER NATURE LIKES TO TAKE PEOPLE BY SURPRISE AND IT HAPPENED THAT SHE CHOSE THIS VERY DAY TO MAKE HER PROMISED VISIT
PETER GAVE A LONG SIGH
MY
MR FOX GRUMBLED
SOMETIMES HE USED TO ENVY MR FOX HIS BEAUTIFUL RED TAIL WITH ITS BLACK AND WHITE TIP
I WONDER HOW IT HAPPENS THAT HE DOES IT THOUGHT HE
HE WAS SMART IN THE FIRST PLACE EVEN SMARTER THAN MR FOX AND HE VERY EARLY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT IF HE WOULD LIVE IT MUST BE BY HIS WITS FOR HE WASN'T BIG ENOUGH OR STRONG ENOUGH TO FIGHT WITH HIS NEIGHBORS SUCH AS HIS BIG COUSIN MR TIMBER WOLF OR MR LYNX OR MR PANTHER OR OLD KING BEAR WHO WAS KING NO LONGER
I--I THINK HEREAFTER I'LL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH MY OWN SUIT EVEN IF IT ISN'T HANDSOME
SEEMED LIKE HE WOULDN'T BE HAPPY IF HE COULDN'T GET INTO TROUBLE
I--I WAS JUST WISHING THAT I HAD A BEGAN PETER
HAPPY JACK 2
HIS WIDE-SPREAD SHARP CLAWS CAUGHT IN LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK'S COAT NEAR THE NECK AND TORE LITTLE STRIPS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF IT
SO MR RABBIT CALLED ON MR SKUNK AND MR COON AND MR MINK AND MR SQUIRREL AND MR CHIPMUNK AND ALL THE REST OF HIS NEIGHBORS TELLING THEM OF HIS TROUBLE AND ASKING THEM TO HELP
NOW PETER WAS QUITE AS INDIGNANT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE COULDN'T OR SHOULDN'T BELIEVE HIS OWN EARS AS THEY WERE BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY TOLD HIM AND ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY HE COULDN'T PUT THE MATTER OUT OF HIS MIND
THE IDEA OF A KING WITHOUT A TAIL THAT'S SO ASSENTED MR WOLF
WHY THOUGHT HE IF I MAKE A POND AT THE PLACE NEAREST TO MY FOOD TREES I CAN CARRY THE WATER TO THE TREES INSTEAD OF THE TREES TO THE WATER
HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK-HEADED COUSIN OF OL MISTAH BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
OF COURSE HE WASN'T OLD THEN
OF COURSE
WHEN HE WAS TELLING A LIE HE WOULD WINK ONE EYE
HE MADE MY MOUTH WATER THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM
THAT SEEMS FUNNY TO ME
IN FACT BY JUST FOLLOWING AFTER THEM SLOWLY HE FOUND ALL HE WANTED TO EAT
AT FIRST BEFORE HE WAS MADE KING OF THE GREEN FOREST HE DIDN'T MIND THIS AT ALL
THERE HE FOUND GRANDFATHER FROG SETTING ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD JUST AS USUAL
THEN THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES SETTLED THEMSELVES ON THE LILY-PADS IN A BIG CIRCLE AROUND GRANDFATHER FROG AND PETER SAT DOWN AS CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL AS HE DARED TO GET
I WONDER NOW WHY IT IS THAT FLITTER NEVER COMES OUT UNTIL AFTER JOLLY ROUND RED MR SUN HAS GONE TO BED BEHIND THE PURPLE HILLS
SOME COULD SWIM AS LONG AS THEY COULD KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER BUT AS SOON AS THEY PUT THEIR HEADS UNDER WATER THEY WERE LIKELY TO DROWN
MR RABBIT GRUMBLED
BESIDES RIGHT DOWN IN HIS HEART HE WASN'T SORRY FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE ONLY ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN FOUND OUT
AT FIRST OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD INTENDED TO TAKE AWAY THE FINE COAT OF WHICH MR JAY WAS SO PROUD BUT WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD LOST HIS FINE VOICE HE WAS SO ASHAMED THAT HE HURRIED AWAY TO HIDE HIMSELF FROM THE EYES OF HIS NEIGHBORS SO THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CHANGE HIS COAT JUST THEN
NO SIR THEY NEVER GET CROSS
AT FIRST OLD MOTHER NATURE REFUSED BUT HE BEGGED SO HARD AND PROMISED SO FAITHFULLY NEVER AGAIN TO BE DISCONTENTED THAT FINALLY SHE RELENTED AND TOOK AWAY HIS TAIL ALL BUT JUST A WEE LITTLE BIT
HIS HOUSE WAS WITH HIM AND NOW HE HAD SIMPLY RETIRED INSIDE
HE DIDN'T STOP TO THINK THAT PROBABLY ALL OF THEM HAD USE FOR THEIR TAILS
VERY GOOD SAID GRANDFATHER FROG
HE HAD SEEN THE HOUSES OF MOST OF HIS OTHER FRIENDS BUT THINK AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD HE DIDN'T REMEMBER HAVING SEEN SPOTTY'S
HE FELT THAT IT WAS A DISGRACE THAT HE THE KING SHOULD HAVE NO TAIL
A REMINDER OF WHAT GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT TWO OR THREE TIMES
SHE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO RUN AND JUMP AND CLIMB AND DIG ACCORDING TO WHICH THINGS THEY LIKED BEST TO DO SO THAT IT WASN'T VERY LONG BEFORE A LOT OF THEM FORGOT THAT THEY EVER HAD LIVED IN THE WATER AND THEY BEGAN TO LOOK DOWN ON THOSE WHO STILL LIVED IN THE WATER AND TO PUT ON AIRS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS VERY HIGH
THERE WAS ONE FOR CHEERFULNESS AND ONE FOR FAITH AND ONE FOR PERSISTENCE IN MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD MATTER AND STAYING AT HOME
I'VE FOUND THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR MOST THINGS
SOMETIMES IT WAS A STOREHOUSE BROKEN INTO AND THE BEST THINGS TAKEN
I THOUGHT HE WASN'T VERY FAR AWAY GRUNTED GRANDFATHER FROG WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES
INDEED THE LEGS OF THE LAST ONE HE TRIED TO SWALLOW STUCK OUT OF ONE CORNER OF HIS BIG MOUTH
THEN HE WAS MADE KING OVER ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND HIS WORD WAS LAW
MR LYNX LOOKED UP AND GRINNED
I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S GO OVER TO THE SMILING POOL AND ASK GRANDFATHER FROG
OH MY NO
OH MY NO
OH MY NO
GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED
WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS III
MAY AH ASK YO A QUESTION BRER BUZZARD SAID HE
YOU SEE PETER HAS A GREAT ADMIRATION FOR FINE TAILS
SO THOSE WHO HEAR HIM ALWAYS SAY THAT HE HAS MANY VOICES AND THAT CERTAINLY IS THE WAY IT SEEMS
BURGESS AUTHOR OF OLD MOTHER WEST WIND AND THE BED TIME STORY-BOOKS ILLUSTRATIONS IN COLOR BY HARRISON CADY BOSTON LITTLE BROWN AND COMPANY 1920 ILLUSTRATION
I WONDER SOMETHING THAT I BET YOU DON'T KNOW HE REPLIED
CHUG-A-RUM BEGAN GRANDFATHER FROG HIS BIG GOGGLY EYES TWINKLING
FROM THIS TIME ON NO ONE WILL BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU SAY AND YOU SHALL HAVE NO FRIENDS
MR BEAR WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY WITHOUT ONE AND WAS SO BUSY GETTING ENOUGH TO EAT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME FOR SILLY THOUGHTS OR VAIN WISHES
IF HE HAD A LOT OF THESE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HIM
IF HE HAD MADE THIS HOLE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER I WOULD GO DOWN AND PULL HIM OUT BUT I AM TOO TIRED TO DO ANY DIGGING NOW I TELL YOU WHAT REPLIED MR BADGER
AND THIS IS THE STORY THAT GRANDFATHER FROG TOLD
WHEN HE THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK CRAWLED OUT OF THE OLD STUMP AND HURRIED HOME
HE JUST COULDN'T SIT STILL FOR WONDERING AND WONDERING WHY REDDY FOX WEARS A RED COAT
YOU CERTAINLY ARE SLOW PETER RABBIT
THEN ALMOST WITHOUT REALIZING WHAT HE WAS DOING LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK BEGAN TO SHOUT AT BIG MR BOB CAT AND TO CALL HIM NAMES
HE NEVER STAYS IN ONE PLACE LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO ASK HIM ANYTHING SAID HE
HE WAS DISHONEST AND STOLE FROM OLD KING BEAR
SO OFF THEY SCAMPERED TO THE SMILING POOL
IT SEEMED SO WONDERFUL THAT FLITTER COULD REALLY FLY THAT WHENEVER HE SAW HIM PETER HAD TO STOP AND WATCH
HE COULD JUST FLOP ABOUT ON THE GROUND AND WAS ALMOST HELPLESS
BESIDES IT IS ALWAYS SUCH A JOKE
I WISH I COULD FLY FLITTER THE BAT MADE PETER RABBIT'S HEAD DIZZY
RIGHT HERE IN THE SMILING POOL
IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG
IT WAS JUST SO WITH PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK
OF COURSE PETER CAN RUN SO MUCH FASTER THAN JOHNNY CHUCK THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IT IF HE HAD TRIED HIS BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY
SIT DOWN PETER AND LEARN A LESSON FROM THE TALE OF THE TAIL OF OLD KING BEAR SAID HE VERY SERIOUSLY
THEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE OTHERS CAME DROPPING IN EACH LICKING HIS CHOPS AND ALL VERY POLITE TO OLD KING BEAR
A MINUTE LATER MR COYOTE HOWLED AGAIN FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD HOWLED IN THE FIRST PLACE
MR BAT WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS BATS HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO LIVE IN CAVES AND FLY IN THE EVENING
I'LL BEAT YOU TO THE SMILING POOL SHOUTED PETER
NOW CUTTING DOWN TREES IS HARD WORK
BUT IF YOU MOVE OR ASK ANY FOOLISH QUESTIONS I'LL STOP RIGHT WHERE I AM AND YOU'LL NEVER HEAR THE END OF THE STORY FOR NO ONE ELSE KNOWS IT OF COURSE PETER AND JOHNNY PROMISED TO SIT PERFECTLY STILL AND NOT SAY A WORD
OF COURSE THAT MEANT THAT HE COULD VERY EASILY BE CAUGHT AND SO THE GROUND WAS NO LONGER A SAFE PLACE FOR HIM
AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE HADN'T AND THEN I THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE
UNC BILLY SAYS IT IS A LOT EASIER THAN RUNNING AWAY AND SAFER TOO
I JUST LOVE IT
NOW TOADSTOOLS AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE NOT VERY WELL FASTENED AT THE ROOTS AND THIS ONE WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST
WHEN ANY ONE HAD BEEN ROBBED HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO OFFER SYMPATHY AND JOIN IN THE HUNT FOR THE THIEF
SO MR BAT WENT LOOKING FOR A PLACE WHERE HE COULD BE QUIET ALL BY HIMSELF AND THINK WITHOUT DANGER OF BEING GOBBLED UP FOR SOME ONE'S DINNER CONTINUED GRANDFATHER FROG
THEY RACED AND DODGED AND TWISTED AND TURNED
WHERE DO YOU LIVE SPOTTY SLOWLY TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED UP AT PETER
AND I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE EVER SO PROUD OF YOUR WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT
MR MOLE LIVED JUST AS THE REST DID
PADDY THE BEAVER HAS ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TAILS I KNOW OF
THERE MUST BE A REASON I SUPPOSE BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT
IF HE HAD HAD HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE AND WORRY
THE ADVENTURES OF BUSTER BEAR 12
HE WENT ABOUT JUST AS BEFORE HUNTING FOR HIS LIVING AND HAD NO MORE TIME THAN BEFORE FOR FOOLISH THOUGHTS OR VAIN WISHES
YOU AND YOUR QUESTIONS ARE A NUISANCE PETER RABBIT AND I MAY AS WELL GET RID OF YOU NOW AS TO HAVE YOU KEEP COMING DOWN HERE AND PESTERING ME TO DEATH
FINALLY THEY WENT AWAY STILL CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES AND FROM THAT DAY TO THIS FOXES AND BADGERS HAVE NEVER BEEN FRIENDS
BUT OLD MR POSSUM WAS MIGHTY SPRY AND HE WENT OFF THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST LAUGHING FIT TO KILL HIMSELF
THERE WAS PLENTY OF FOOD TO EAT RIGHT DOWN UNDER GROUND--WORMS AND GRUBS--ALL HE NEEDED
WHEN HE CAME OUT AND STARTED TO HUNT FOR HIS BREAKFAST SOME ONE WAS SURE TO TELL HIM OF MISCHIEF DONE DURING THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
PETER RABBIT DREW A LONG BREATH WHICH WAS ALMOST A SIGH
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY OF THESE REPLIES WERE LIES AND EVERY TIME HE TOLD ONE OF THESE HE WINKED WITHOUT KNOWING IT
UNC BILLY HAD JUST GRINNED AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS MAMMY
BESIDES HE RATHER ENJOYS TELLING STORIES
IF I HAD I WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE LONG AGO
SO HE WENT TO WORK AT ONCE AND DUG A HOLE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE COMFORTABLE HE MADE A BIG HOLE
HE'S RIGHT OVER BEHIND THAT LITTLE CLUMP OF TALL GRASS HUMPH
THEY MUST LEARN TO WATCH OUT FOR THEMSELVES
BUT HE KEPT HIS MOUTH TIGHT CLOSED DID MR FOX AND WAS VERY HUMBLE AND POLITE TO EVERYBODY
HE WAS JUST AS SMART AND JUST AS CLEVER
NOW JUST AT THAT PLACE ON THE BANK WAS GROWING A TOADSTOOL
SHE DIDN'T SAY A WORD UNTIL EVERYBODY HAD PAID THEIR RESPECTS AND PASSED BEFORE HER
AS HE FLEW BACK TO THE CAVE A GREAT IDEA CAME TO HIM THE IDEA FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN THINKING SO HARD
AFTER THAT HE WAS NEATER THAN EVER YOU MAY BE SURE AND THE NEXT TIME OLD MOTHER NATURE CAME AROUND SHE LEFT ANOTHER HANDSOME BLACK RING ON HIS TAIL BECAUSE HE HADN'T GROWN CARELESS BUT HAD KEPT UP HIS GOOD HABITS
HE DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE USE FOR IT AND YET HE HAD TO CARRY IT WITH HIM WHEREVER HE WENT
HE COULD ASK MO QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AN ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PETER AND LAUGHED
HE WAS VERY QUIET AND BASHFUL WAS MR TURTLE AND HE NEVER MEDDLED WITH ANY ONE'S BUSINESS BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT THE BEST WAY OF KEEPING OUT OF TROUBLE WAS TO ATTEND STRICTLY TO HIS OWN AFFAIRS
HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW VERY PLUMP HE LOOKS YES REPLIED MR FOX
GO ASK GRANDFATHER FROG
MISTAH BUZZARD FLY RIGHT OVER AN SIT ON THAT CHIMNEY-TOP FO TO WARM HIS TOES
SOME HAD HANDSOME TAILS AND SOME HAD HOMELY TAILS
AND THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS THAT GRANDFATHER FROG TOLD THIS STORY TO THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE GATHERED AROUND HIM ON THE BANK OF THE SMILING POOL
YO SEE IF WE-UNS KEEP OUR TOES WARM WE-UNS ARE WARM ALL OVER
IT BOTHERED HIM WHEN HE WALKED
XIII WHY BUSTER BEAR APPEARS TO HAVE NO TAIL PETER RABBIT HAD SOMETHING NEW TO BOTHER HIS BUMP OF CURIOSITY
HE KNEW THOSE VOICES RIGHT AWAY
HE IS VERY FOND OF SITTING WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED THAT WAY
AND ONE AND ALL THEY BEGAN TO BLAME OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE ALWAYS SEEMED HAPPIEST WHEN HE WAS BUSIEST AND BECAUSE HE LIKED TO BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME HE TRIED TO KEEP BUSY ALL THE TIME
MR JAY GRUMBLED
HIS CHILLEN JES LIKE HIM AN HIS CHILLEN'S CHILLEN THE SAME WAY
OH MOTHER NATURE HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU HE CRIED
I DO BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT JOHNNY CHUCK AND IF YOU ARE THERE MUST BE A STORY ABOUT IT AND IF THERE IS A STORY GRANDFATHER FROG WILL BE SURE TO KNOW IT
MR COON COULDN'T DO ANYTHING THE REST OF THAT DAY BUT LOOK AT AND ADMIRE THAT RING UNTIL HIS NECK ACHED FROM TWISTING IT AROUND SO LONG
YES SIR SOMETIMES HE'D BE GONE UNTIL ALMOST MORNING
III WHY UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYS DEAD ONE THING PUZZLED PETER RABBIT AND JOHNNY CHUCK AND STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GREAT DEAL AFTER THEY HAD COME TO KNOW UNC BILLY POSSUM AND HIS FUNNY WAYS
OLD KING BEAR WAS HUNGRY AND HE WORKED HIMSELF UP INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE FOR HE WAS IN A HURRY FOR HIS BREAKFAST
OLD MOTHER NATURE'S EYES TWINKLED
I NEVER MEDDLE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS AND THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS SAID LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK
HE GRINNED TO HIMSELF AND PRETENDED TO GO TO SLEEP
THEN SUDDENLY HE MADE A FACE
JENNY WREN'S BUSY TONGUE HAD SET THAT CURIOSITY FAIRLY BOILING OVER
BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO BE DOING IT AND MR SKUNK TOLD HIM SO
OVER IN A LITTLE PATH IN THE MEADOW GRASS WAS WALKING OLD MR MEADOW MOUSE
YOU SIT HERE A MINUTE HE WHISPERED IN JOHNNY CHUCK'S EAR
GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT AND BEGAN AGAIN
HE WAS SAFE AND HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HE COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO EAT BY DIGGING FOR IT
I KNOW YOU
FROM CHEATING MR SNAKE JUST NATURALLY SLIPPED TO STEALING
IT MUST BE FINE TO FLY THOUGHT PETER
IT MUST BE FINE TO FLY THOUGHT PETER
WHY BUSTER BEAR APPEARS TO HAVE NO TAIL XIV
CHUG-A-RUM SAID HE
CHUG-A-RUM SAID HE
ALL THE TIME MR POSSUM LAY JUST AS IF HE WERE DEAD BECAUSE HE WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO MOVE
OF COURSE SAID PETER TO GRANDFATHER FROG OLD MOTHER NATURE KNOWS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN I DO REALLY
PETER RABBIT 3
OF COURSE THERE IS A REASON ASSERTED JOHNNY CHUCK CHEWING THE END OF A BLADE OF GRASS
IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROG'S OL MISTAH BUZZARD GRINNED AND SLOWLY WINKED ONE EYE AT UNC BILLY POSSUM AS HE REPLIED
THANK YOU THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG SAID HE
HE HID OLD KING BEAR'S BREAKFAST WHILE THE LATTER HAD HIS HEAD TURNED AND THEN PRETENDED THAT HE HAD JUST COME ALONG
SOMETIMES IT WAS OF WORSE THINGS THAT WERE TOLD IN WHISPERS
ONE MORNING THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES FOUND GRANDFATHER FROG SITTING AS USUAL ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND THEY KNEW BY THE WAY HE FOLDED HIS HANDS ACROSS HIS WHITE AND YELLOW WAISTCOAT THAT IT WAS FULL OF FOOLISH GREEN FLIES
WHY MR
MR COON WAS THE LAST TO BE CALLED BEFORE HER AND INSTEAD OF BEING FROWNING AND CROSS AS SHE HAD BEEN TO THE OTHERS SHE WAS ALL SMILES
HE DID IT JUST TO TEASE PETER
THEY WERE THE VOICES OF MR FOX AND MR BADGER
THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE SMARTEST AND THE SLIEST AND THE MOST FEARED AND DISLIKED OF ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE ON THE MEADOWS OR IN THE FOREST
BY DOING AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE DONE ATTENDING WHOLLY TO YOUR OWN AFFAIRS REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE
HE HEAR SOMEBODY INSIDE TALKING TO THEIRSELF BUT HE CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY SAY JES A MUMBLING SOUND THAT COME UP THE CHIMNEY TO HIM
THAT'S EASY REPLIED JOHNNY
WHEN OLD MOTHER NATURE TURNED HER HEAD HE EVEN RAN OUT HIS TONGUE AT HER JUST AS ALL THE SNAKE FAMILY DO AT YOU AND ME TO-DAY
THEY ROMPED AND RACED AND DANCED AWAY SOME ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER TO SEE WHOM THEY COULD FIND TO PLAY WITH
THAT'S WHAT I SAID--CAN'T REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
HE HURRIED OVER TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK AND THERE HE MADE ANOTHER DISCOVERY
HE HAD SAT THAT WAY FOR THE LONGEST TIME WITHOUT ONCE MOVING
IT KEPT HIM JUST AS WARM AS IF IT WERE A BEAUTIFUL RED LIKE THAT OF MR FOX OR HANDSOME BLACK AND WHITE LIKE THAT OF MR SKUNK
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO RUN AWAY AT ALL
HE FOUND THAT HIS FOOD TASTED BETTER FOR BEING SO CLEAN AND HE GREW VERY FUSSY ABOUT WHAT HE ATE
FOR A LONG TIME EVERYTHING WENT SMOOTHLY WITH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST AND THE GREEN MEADOWS
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY AND IN A MINUTE GRANDFATHER FROG BEGAN THE STORY PETER SO MUCH WANTED
OF COURSE YOU HAVE HEARD ALL ABOUT WHAT A VERY FINE GENTLEMAN SAMMY JAY'S GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THOUGHT TO BE UNTIL IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS ALL THE TIME STEALING FROM HIS NEIGHBORS AND PUTTING THE BLAME ON OTHERS AND HOW OLD MOTHER NATURE PUNISHED HIM BY TAKING AWAY THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE OF WHICH HE WAS SO PROUD AND GIVING HIM INSTEAD THE HARSH VOICE WHICH SAMMY HAS NOW AND MAKING HIM TELL JUST WHAT HE IS BY SCREAMING THIEF THIEF THIEF EVERY TIME HE OPENS HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK
THEN WHENEVER OLD KING BEAR CAME NEAR THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS HIDDEN OLD MR POSSUM WOULD HIDE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
HE DIDN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT WHAT HIS NEIGHBOR LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK HAD DONE FOR HIM FOR YOU REMEMBER HE HADN'T SEEN MR BOB CAT AT ALL
PRETTY SOON HE MET MR PANTHER
OF COURSE SOME OF THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES SAW HIM RIGHT AWAY
HE IS QUITE USED TO BEING LAUGHED AT FOR ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY AND HE DOESN'T MIND IT IN THE LEAST
AT FIRST SHE WAS VERY INDIGNANT OH VERY INDIGNANT INDEED
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE MENDED HIM WAYS WOULDN'T YOU PETER NODDED
OF COURSE I KNOW YOU LIVE IN THE SMILING POOL BUT WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE
LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK JUST SNUGGLED DOWN FLATTER THAN EVER AND DIDN'T SAY A WORD
BESIDES HE WAS SO FAT THAT TO RUN MADE HIM PUFF AND BLOW
BUT IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE HE FOUND THAT HIS NEW TAIL WAS VERY MUCH IN THE WAY
SO PRESENTLY HE CLIMBED BACK ON TO HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD BLINKING HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES AND LOOKING JUST A WEE BIT FOOLISH
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA
SO THE FIRST THING PETER DID WHEN HE SAW BUSTER BEAR WAS TO LOOK TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A TAIL HE HAD
WHY WHILE HE SLEPT THAT NIGHT SHE HEALED HIS SORE THROAT AND SHE GAVE HIM A NEW VOICE
WHERE DO YOU LIVE WITH THAT SPOTTY DISAPPEARED
AND WHEN YOU SEE MISCHIEF TROTTING ALONG THE LONE LITTLE PATH IF YOU LOOK SHARP ENOUGH YOU'LL SEE TROUBLE FOLLOWING AT HIS HEELS LIKE A SHADOW
HE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT HE EVER HAD SEEN SPOTTY'S HOUSE
THEN THEY RUMPLE UP HIS HAIR AND PULL HIS WHISKERS AND GIVE HIM LAST TAG AND RACE DOWN TO THE SMILING POOL TO SEE GRANDFATHER FROG AND BEG HIM FOR A STORY
HE WONDERED IF OL MISTAH BUZZARD WOULD HAVE TO BE TEASED FOR A STORY LIKE GRANDFATHER FROG
HE DIDN'T SEE MR MEADOW MOUSE BUT HE WOULD IN A FEW MINUTES
MR COYOTE STILL MANAGED TO PICK UP A LIVING BUT HE WAS HUNGRY MOST OF THE TIME AND THE LESS HE HAD TO PUT IN HIS STOMACH THE SHARPER HIS WITS GREW
PLEASE DO BEGGED THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES
JOHNNY CHUCK SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY
DO TELL US ABOUT IT
SHE WAS GREATLY PLEASED WITH ALL SHE SAW AS SHE WENT ALONG UNTIL SHE CAME TO THE HOME OF MR RABBIT
AT LAST GRANDFATHER FROG CLEARED HIS THROAT ONCE MORE AND WITH A FAR-AWAY LOOK IN HIS GREAT GOGGLY EYES BEGAN
INDEED HE HAD SO MUCH BROUGHT TO HIM THAT HE COULDN'T BEGIN TO EAT ALL OF IT AND HE GREW VERY DAINTY AND FUSSY ABOUT WHAT HE DID EAT
EVERYBODY LIKED HIM AND WHENEVER HE MADE A CALL HE WAS SURE OF A WELCOME
NOW IN SPITE OF THE TROUBLE MR RABBIT WAS FOREVER MAKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE BY HIS DREADFUL CURIOSITY AND MEDDLING WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S AFFAIRS ALL HIS NEIGHBORS HAD A WARM PLACE IN THEIR HEARTS FOR MR RABBIT AND THEY ALL PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD HELP HIM AS SOON AS THEY HAD THEIR OWN WORK FINISHED
IT HAS BEAUTIFUL RINGS OF BLACK AND GRAY AND PETER DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER TAIL AT ALL LIKE IT
PETER LOOKED ASHAMED AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD HOLD HIS TONGUE RIGHT BETWEEN HIS TEETH UNTIL GRANDFATHER FROG WAS THROUGH
WILL YOU TELL US NEXT TIME WHY BOBBY COON WEARS RINGS ON HIS TAIL PERHAPS REPLIED GRANDFATHER FROG
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE IN YOUR WAY
II WHY PETER RABBIT CANNOT FOLD HIS HANDS HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL SAT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED ACROSS HIS WHITE WAISTCOAT
YES SIREE CUTTING DOWN TREES IS THE HARDEST KIND OF HARD WORK
YES SIR MOST OF THE ANIMALS LIVED IN THE WATER AS SENSIBLE ANIMALS DO TO-DAY PETER NUDGED JOHNNY CHUCK
THE PIECE OF BARK WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND SCRATCHED HIS BACK I WISH SAID HE TALKING TO HIMSELF FOR HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANY ONE ELSE WAS NEAR I WISH THAT I HAD A HOUSE OF MY OWN THAT I COULD CARRY ON MY BACK ALL THE TIME AND BE PERFECTLY SAFE WHEN I WAS INSIDE OF IT YOU SHALL HAVE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE AND REACHING OUT SHE TOUCHED HIS BACK AND TURNED THE SKIN INTO HARD SHELL
YOU SEE HE HAD CHEATED HIS NEIGHBORS AND HAD STOLEN FROM THEM FOR SO LONG THAT HE FOUND THIS THE EASIEST WAY TO GET A LIVING
FOOD WAS PLENTY AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
PETER LAUGHED WITH THE REST ALTHOUGH HE LOOKED A WEE BIT FOOLISH
NOW YOU KNOW WHY JIMMY SKUNK WHOM YOU ALL KNOW IS SO INDEPENDENT AND NEVER HURRIES THANK YOU
BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD TAIL AS IT IS HE ADDED HASTILY
I MEAN WHERE IS YOUR HOUSE RETURNED PETER
AND ANOTHER THING PETER RABBIT
EVERYBODY LAUGHED FOR EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT NO ONE ASKS MORE QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT
HE HAD TO BE TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIS BIG NEIGHBORS FOR IN THOSE DAYS HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MEANS OF PROTECTING HIMSELF AS JIMMY HAS NOW
OF COURSE YOU ALL KNOW THAT LONG LONG AGO WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THINGS WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY ARE NOW VERY DIFFERENT INDEED
WHEN HE DID THAT PETER ALWAYS WINKED GOOD-NATUREDLY
WITH A LONG STICK SHE REACHED IN AND TICKLED THE END OF HIS NOSE
ALMOST EVERYTHING TO-DAY IS THE RESULT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THOSE LONG-AGO DAYS
IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE MR SKUNK SAW THAT IN THEIR HURRY THEY OVERLOOKED A GREAT DEAL
HE SHOOK AND SHOOK AND SHOOK AND SHOOK AND THE FIRST THING OLD MR POSSUM KNEW HE WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE ALL READY TO POUNCE ON HIM
MR TURTLE DID AS HE WAS TOLD TO DO AND THERE HE WAS IN THE VERY BEST AND SAFEST KIND OF A HOUSE PERFECTLY HIDDEN FROM ALL HIS ENEMIES
ASK GRANDFATHER FROG
BUT AFTER A LITTLE HE TOLD HER THAT HE WANTED A TAIL
THEN HE BEGAN TO LAUGH FOR IT CAME TO HIM THAT WHAT SPOTTY HAD SAID WAS TRUE
SHE TOLD HIM THAT HE HADN'T THE LEAST USE IN THE WORLD FOR A TAIL AND THAT HE WOULDN'T BE ANY HAPPIER IF HE HAD ONE
OLD MOTHER NATURE PUNISHED HIM BY PUTTING MUSTARD IN HIS FOOD AND MR COON THOUGHT HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE COULD GET AHEAD OF OLD MOTHER NATURE BY WASHING ALL HIS FOOD BEFORE HE ATE IT
DANNY HUNG HIS HEAD AND RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD BITE HIS TONGUE BEFORE HE ASKED ANOTHER QUESTION
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE BUT I WONDER WHY IT IS THAT HE FLIES ONLY AT NIGHT
IF ANYTHING THEY THINK JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE OF STRIPED CHIPMUNK BECAUSE HE WON'T PLAY
HE'LL BE SURE TO KNOW AND PERHAPS IF HE IS FEELING GOOD HE'LL TELL US A STORY SAID PETER
HE WHIRLED ABOUT
I NEVER KNEW IT TO FAIL
THE LATTER CLEARED HIS THROAT TWO OR THREE TIMES EACH TIME AS IF HE INTENDED TO BEGIN RIGHT THEN
IN THIS WAY HE MANAGED TO GET MANY MEALS OF SCRAPS
ONE MORNING THE VERY IMP OF MISCHIEF SEEMED TO GET INTO OLD MR POSSUM'S HEAD
PETER THANKED THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES FOR THE WARNING AND THEN HE ASKED THEM HOW MANY OF HIS FAMILY OLD MAN COYOTE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
I DON'T SEE WHAT HE HAS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER FOR ANYWAY
THERE'S A STRIPE FOR EVERY TEAR MADE IN YOUR OLD COAT BY THE CLAWS OF MR BOB CAT THE DAY YOU SAVED MR MEADOW MOUSE
IT WAS MR FISHER AND HE WAS VERY HUNGRY AND FIERCE
I'M GLAD THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT
NOW YO KNOW THAT WAY DOWN IN OL VIRGINNY WHERE AH DONE COME FROM MAH FAM'LY DONE GOT THE HABIT OF SITTING ON THE TOPS OF CHIMNEYS IN THE WINTERTIME TO WARM THEIR TOES WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS WARM DOWN SOUTH INTERRUPTED PETER RABBIT
HE BELIEVED IN PREPARING TO-DAY FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO-MORROW AND SO WHEN HE HAD ALL THE FOOD HE NEEDED FOR THE PRESENT HE STORED AWAY FOOD FOR THE TIME WHEN IT MIGHT NOT BE SO EASY TO GET
EVERYBODY WAS HUNGRY AND YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH HUNGRY PEOPLE--THEY GROW UGLY AND QUARRELSOME
ONE DAY AS HE SAT BESIDE THE LAUGHING BROOK EATING HIS SUPPER HE NOTICED THAT WHILE HIS FOOD HAD BEEN WASHED CLEAN HIS HANDS WERE DIRTY
HE BROODED OVER IT SO MUCH THAT HE LOST HIS APPETITE AND GREW CROSS AND PEEVISH
I'M GLAD I DID IT HE MUTTERED
AND SO EVER SINCE THAT LONG-AGO DAY WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THAT LITTLE BAG OF PERFUME HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN IN THE SKUNK FAMILY AND NONE OF THEM HAS EVER BEEN AFRAID
MR SKUNK HAD TO TRY HIS NEW DEFENCE ONLY ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE HIS ENEMIES TOOK THE GREATEST CARE TO LET HIM ALONE
THEY DIDN'T FILL HIS STOMACH BUT THEY KEPT HIM FROM STARVING
NO MATTER WHERE HE FOUND IT OR HOW TEMPTING IT LOOKED HE WOULDN'T EAT IT UNTIL HE HAD CARRIED IT TO THE NEAREST WATER AND WASHED IT
SO OLD KING BEAR RULED IN THE GREEN FOREST AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY AND CONTENTED
MAH FAM'LY NAME IS VULTURE SAID HE
IN FACT SAMMY'S COAT HAS LONG BEEN THE ENVY OF A GREAT MANY OF HIS NEIGHBORS IN THE GREEN FOREST
HE GREW SO LAZY THAT HE WANTED TO BE WAITED ON ALL THE TIME
YES SIR IT CERTAINLY DID SEEM THAT WAY
OH DEAR SIGHED MR RABBIT AS HE LOOKED AT THE TANGLE OF BRAMBLES WHICH ALMOST HID THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE I NEVER NEVER CAN CLEAR AWAY ALL THIS
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT A HANDSOME COAT
THERE WAS MR MEADOW MOUSE PLAYING WITH HIS CHILDREN
THEN HE SAT DOWN ON THE OLD LOG AGAIN AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY AS HE LOOKED THIS WAY AND THAT
WHEN PETER TOLD HIM THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD NOT BEEN FAIR IN GIVING HIM SUCH A FOOLISH LITTLE TAIL WHEN SHE HAD GIVEN OTHERS SUCH BEAUTIFUL ONES GRANDFATHER FROG JUST OPENED HIS BIG MOUTH AND LAUGHED UNTIL HE HAD TO HOLD HIS SIDES
AT LAST OLD KING BEAR TURNED HIS HEAD SUDDENLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF OLD MR POSSUM HIDING THAT BREAKFAST IN A NEW PLACE
SOME HAD LONG TAILS
MR COYOTE KEPT AFTER HIM YELPING AND HOWLING UNTIL HE WAS SURE THAT MR LYNX WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HE WOULDN'T DARE COME BACK
IF IT HADN'T MR BOB CAT WOULD SURELY HAVE PULLED HIM OUT
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND--BECAUSE HE IS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND SATISFIED THERE JUST THEN UP CAME PETER RABBIT ALL OUT OF BREATH
VERY HUMBLY OLD KING BEAR WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND BEGGED HER TO TAKE AWAY HIS TAIL
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE
BUT HE COULD GET ONE HAND AND ARM IN AND HE DID FEELING ALL AROUND INSIDE FOR LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK
AND AS FOR HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL AND REDDY FOX AND BOBBY COON AND JIMMY SKUNK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT BEAUTIFUL TAILS THEY HAVE
IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE AND TRIED TO TELL PETER THAT ALL THAT NOISE WAS MADE BY JUST ONE VOICE HE WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED YOU
HE HAS A BALD HAID JES LIKE AH HAVE BUT HIS HAID IS BLACK INSTEAD OF RED
WHY HE CRIED I BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST USEFUL TAIL IN ALL THE WORLD AND THEN HE WISHED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE WOULD RETURN SO THAT HE MIGHT THANK HER FOR IT
IF YOU PLEASE GRANDFATHER FROG WHY DOES REDDY FOX WEAR A RED COAT PANTED PETER QUITE OUT OF BREATH
BY AND BY THINGS GOT SO BAD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF OLD MOTHER NATURE AND SHE CAME TO FIND OUT WHAT IT ALL MEANT
THEY ALWAYS TRIED TO RUN AWAY
THEY ARE HONOR STRIPES AND HEREAFTER YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN SHALL ALWAYS WEAR STRIPES AND THAT IS HOW IT HAPPENS THAT STRIPED CHIPMUNK COMES BY HIS STRIPED COAT AND WHY HE IS SO PROUD OF IT AND TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF IT CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
ONE DAY HE HAD CRAWLED UNDER A PIECE OF BARK TO REST AND AT THE SAME TIME KEEP OUT OF SIGHT OF ANY WHO MIGHT HAPPEN ALONG
I NEVER HAVE SEEN ANY OF THEM WINK EITHER
THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF JIMMY SKUNK WAS SLIMMER AND TRIMMER THAN JIMMY IS
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
WELL WHAT IS IT THIS TIME IF YOU PLEASE REPLIED PETER POLITELY AND HAPPILY FOR HE SAW THAT GRANDFATHER FROG WAS FEELING GOOD-NATURED WHY IS IT THAT FLITTER THE BAT FLIES ONLY AT NIGHT GRANDFATHER FROG CLIMBED OUT ON HIS BIG GREEN LILY-PAD AND MADE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE
ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG OLD MR CHIPMUNK THE GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED OF STRIPED CHIPMUNK LIVED VERY MUCH AS STRIPED CHIPMUNK DOES NOW
YOU SEE SHE KNEW THAT MRS QUACK'S HOME WAS RIGHT AT THE FOOT OF A RED CLAYBANK
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A STOOL TO SIT ON AND HE COULD WORK ALL DAY LONG WITHOUT TIRING HIS LEGS
MR LYNX STOPPED EATING AND LOOKED UP A LITTLE SURPRISED
NOW WHEN MR FOX HAD PAID HIS RESPECTS AND TURNED HIS BACK OLD MOTHER NATURE SAW SOMETHING RED ON THE TAIL OF HIS COAT
JUST THINK OF ALL THAT MINER MISSES--THE SUNSHINE THE FLOWERS THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS AND THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES TO PLAY WITH
XI WHY BOBBY COON HAS RINGS ON HIS TAIL PETER RABBIT WOULD GIVE GRANDFATHER FROG NO PEACE
CHUG-A-RUM SAID GRANDFATHER FROG IN HIS DEEPEST STORY-TELLING VOICE
BEFORE HE SUCCEEDED HE HEARD SOMEONE COMING SO HE PROMPTLY DREW IN HIS HEAD AND LEGS AND TAIL
SOMEBODY SPRANG UPON HER AS SHE WAS SLEEPING AND IN THE STRUGGLE SHE LOST ALL HER TAIL FEATHERS
X WHY MR
WITH OLD KING BEAR AT THEIR HEAD THEY STARTED OUT TO HUNT FOR OLD MR POSSUM
GRANDFATHER FROG TOOK HIS TIME
AND AS THEY DANCED THEY SANG
WHO IS IT DEARLY LOVES TO PLAY BUT WHEN THERE'S DANGER RUNS AWAY
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM SAID MR PANTHER
YOU SEE OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD LEFT A BEAUTIFUL BROAD BLACK RING AROUND HIS TAIL
I KNOW YOU PETER
THEN VERY SLOWLY HE ASKED
HE MADE HIMSELF JUST AS FLAT AS HE COULD ON THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLLOW AND HELD HIS BREATH
YOU MAY DEPEND I WOULD IF I WERE IN HER PLACE GRANDFATHER FROG CHUCKLED UNTIL HE SHOOK ALL OVER
PETER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND A FEW MINUTES LATER HE HOPPED AWAY TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH LIPPERTY-LIPPERTY-LIP
BOWSER THE HOUND 4
HE QUITE FORGOT THAT MR PANTHER AND MR LYNX COULD CLIMB JUST AS FAST AS HE
THE FIRST TIME PETER RABBIT HEARD OLD MAN COYOTE HE WAS SURE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THERE WAS A WHOLE CROWD OF STRANGERS ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND YOU MAY BE SURE THAT HE KEPT VERY CLOSE TO HIS DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH
HE TOOK PARTICULAR NOTICE OF ALL WHO CAME TO PAY HIM TRIBUTE AND HE SAW THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD A TAIL
AT LAST ONE DAY AS HE STOLE SOFT-FOOTED THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE DISCOVERED MR LYNX HAVING A GREAT FEAST
THEY FILLED UP THE YARD AND OLD MR RABBIT ACTUALLY COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN INTO HIS OWN HOUSE IF HE HADN'T CUT A PATH THROUGH THE BRAMBLES
NOW WITH ALL HIS SMARTNESS MR SNAKE HAD FORGOTTEN ONE THING ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING
HE KEPT RIGHT ON MINDING HIS OWN AFFAIRS AND NEVER MEDDLING IN THE AFFAIRS OF OTHERS SO THAT BY AND BY HIS NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO RESPECT HIM
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT JUST MIGHT BE MEANT FOR A TAIL AND PETER WASN'T EVEN SURE OF THAT
IT CERTAINLY WAS A VERY BAD THING GRANDFATHER FROG SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY
MR SNAKE WAS VERY BOLD
MR BEAR GRUMBLED
THEY LEFT JIMMY TO COME OVER AND DANCE IN A CIRCLE AROUND PETER FOR PETER IS A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THEM
THE TIMES GREW HARDER AND HARDER AND BECAUSE HUNGER IS A HARD AND CRUEL MASTER IT MADE THE LARGER AND STRONGER PEOPLE HARD AND CRUEL TOO
THE ADVENTURES OF OLD MAN COYOTE 15
WHO IS IT HOPS AND SKIPS AND JUMPS
THE ADVENTURES OF PRICKLY PORKY 14
JUST THINK HOW MANY TIMES REDDY FOX OR OLD GRANNY FOX HAVE ALMOST CAUGHT YOU
NEVER JUDGE ANY ONE BY HIS CLOTHES
WHY JERRY MUSKRAT BUILDS HIS HOUSE IN THE WATER VIII
HE SOMETIMES MAKES UP FOR IT BY WARNING PETER WHEN GRANNY OR REDDY FOX HAPPENS TO BE ABOUT AND PETER IS HONEST ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THIS AND PUT IT TO SAMMY'S CREDIT
SOMETIMES PETER WAS SO EXCITED THAT HE WOULD FORGET AND USE ALL FOUR LEGS
HE WAS SO SMART THAT HE SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS THE SMARTEST OF ALL THE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE AND THAT WAS A BAD THING
HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD JUST COME FROM A CALL ON OLD KING BEAR AND HINTED THAT OLD KING BEAR WAS THEN ENJOYING A FEAST AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH FOR MR PANTHER IF HE HURRIED UP THERE AT ONCE
SHE SAW HIM TRY TO BRACE HIMSELF WITH HIS USELESS TAIL AND SHE SAW HIM STOP TO REST HIS TIRED LEGS
NOW THERE IS SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO SMART
YOU SEE IT WAS TOO SMALL VERY MUCH TOO SMALL FOR HIM TO GET INTO HIMSELF
IT WAS GRANDFATHER FROG HIMSELF HAVING HIS MORNING SWIM
DEAR ME DEAR ME SUCH TERRIBLE TIMES AS THERE WERE ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IN THE GREEN FOREST
THERE WOULD BE NO HARM IN TRYING
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE COAT I HAVE GOT PETER RABBIT
EVERYBODY LOOKED SURPRISED
HE WAS JUST GOING TO TURN AWAY WHEN A GREAT DEEP VOICE SAID
MR MUSKRAT HESITATED
MOTHER WEST WIND WHEN STORIES 8
OF COURSE HE TAUGHT HIS CHILDREN TO DO AS HE DID AND THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN
MATTERS GREW WORSE AND WORSE AND THEN IT WAS THAT FEAR WAS BORN
THANK YOU GRANDFATHER FROG
WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY XIII
THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF SPOTTY THE TURTLE LIVED THEN AND UNLIKE SPOTTY WHOM YOU KNOW HE HAD NO HOUSE
WELL IT WASN'T BUSTER'S GREAT SIZE OR WONDERFUL STRENGTH OR BIG CLAWS OR DEEP GRUMBLY-RUMBLY VOICE
WHEREVER HE WENT HE CARRIED THE PIECE OF BARK SO AS TO HAVE IT HANDY TO HIDE UNDER
NO SIR IT WASN'T ONE OF THESE
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
OF COURSE LITTLE MR CHIPMUNK SQUEALED WITH PAIN FOR THOSE CLAWS HURT DREADFULLY BUT HE WAS GLAD THAT HIS COAT TORE
HE FOUND THAT HE NO LONGER HAD TO RUN FOR A SAFE HIDING-PLACE WHEN HE MET MR WOLF OR MR LYNX OR MR PANTHER
SNAKE CANNOT WINK XI
HE SHUT HIS EYES AND THEN HE LANDED WITH A THUMP THAT KNOCKED ALL THE WIND FROM HIS BODY
I--I--WHY HOW STUPID OF ME
HE KNEW THAT HE COULD SWIM IF HE HAD TO BUT ONLY FOR A VERY LITTLE WAY AND HE HATED THE THOUGHT OF IT
HE TOOK ONE GOOD LOOK AT THOSE FIERCE HUNGRY YELLOW EYES AND LONG CRUEL TEETH AND THEN HE WHISKED INTO A HOLE IN THE OLD STUMP
THERE ARE MORE THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAN I DO KNOW BUT I'M ALWAYS READY TO LEARN
HE BROUGHT SOME OF THE LOGS AND STICKS FROM WHICH HE HAD GNAWED THE BARK AND FASTENED THEM WITH THE OTHERS AND RIGHT AWAY THE POOL GREW BIGGER
MOTHER WEST WIND WHY STORIES 6
HE HAD A NEW TAIL
JIMMY SKUNK NOW NOT SO FAR AWAY BUT THAT HE COULD HEAR THEM VERY PLAINLY SAT PETER RABBIT JUST FINISHING HIS BREAKFAST IN A SWEET-CLOVER PATCH
PETER STARED VERY HARD
INDEED I AM GRANDFATHER FROG SAID PETER VERY HUMBLY
HE WAS STROLLING ALONG AS IF THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO FEAR
SOME FOLKS SEEM TO THINK THAT WHAT THEY DO DOESN'T MATTER TO ANYBODY BUT THEMSELVES
WE CERTAINLY WILL MISS HIM
THEN JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD SHOUT NO FAIR PETER WOULD SAY THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO AND TO MAKE UP FOR IT WOULD BE IT AND TRY TO CATCH JOHNNY
THEY KNEW THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR FAT BEETLES FOR HIS BREAKFAST
BUT HE DOES IT IN SUCH A MERRY WAY AND WITH SUCH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYES THAT THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES NEVER GET CROSS BECAUSE HE WON'T PLAY
WHY WAS IT THAT UNC BILLY POSSUM PLAYED DEAD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN AWAY WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED BY HIS ENEMIES
THANK YOU OH THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH GRANDFATHER FROG HE SAID
NO SIR PETER RABBIT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING OF THE KIND
YES SIR MR SKUNK WAS VERY LIVELY ON HIS FEET
THAT WAS A SPLENDID STORY MR BUZZARD SAID HE AND I'M EVER AND EVER SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
I REALLY BELIEVE HE CAN'T FOLD HIS HANDS SAID HAPPY JACK TO HIMSELF BUT SPEAKING ALOUD
SHE HAD GIVEN HIM NIGHT-SEEING EYES AND HE NO MORE HAD TO GO HUNGRY
NOW MR NIGHTHAWK DOESN'T BELONG TO THE HAWK FAMILY AT ALL SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM HIM
NOW OLD KING BEAR WAS THE GREAT-GREAT-EVER-SO-GREAT GRANDFATHER OF BUSTER BEAR AND HE LOOKED VERY MUCH AS BUSTER DOES EXCEPT THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TAIL AT ALL NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF A TAIL
HE WOULD TRY THE SAME TRICK WHENEVER HE WAS CAUGHT
BUT HE DIDN'T
BUT HE DIDN'T
THAT SAID HE TO HIMSELF MEANS THAT IT ISN'T TRUE AND IF THESE FOLKS ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO SEE ME WINK AND KNOW WHAT IT MEANS IT IS THEIR OWN FAULT IF THEY BELIEVE WHAT I AM TELLING THEM BUT ALWAYS HE TOOK CARE TO WINK THE EYE THAT WAS TURNED AWAY FROM THE ONE HE WAS TALKING TO
IT WAS ALL OF ONE COLOR A GRAYISH WHITE NOT AT ALL PRETTY
CERT'NLY REPLIED OL MISTAH BUZZARD
AND THEN A BRIGHT IDEA STRUCK HIM
AND EVER SINCE THAT LONG-AGO DAY WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG THE COONS HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL TAILS AND HAVE KEPT UP THE GOOD HABITS OF OLD MR COON
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY POLITE VERY POLITE INDEED TO EVERY ONE
HE NEVER COMES OUT TO PLAY WITH THE REST OF US--JUST SPENDS ALL HIS TIME BY HIMSELF DOWN IN THE DARK DIGGING AND DIGGING
PETER MADE A FUNNY FACE AND LAUGHED TOO
THE BIG PEOPLE LIKE OLD KING BEAR AND MR WOLF AND MR PANTHER AND MR LYNX BEGAN TO LOOK WITH HUNGRY EYES ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GROW AFRAID AND HIDE FROM THE BIG PEOPLE AND ALL THE TIME THEY WERE CONTINUALLY QUARRELING AMONG THEMSELVES AND STEALING FROM EACH OTHER TO GET ENOUGH TO EAT
I BELIEVE I'LL ASK GRANDFATHER FROG THE VERY NEXT TIME I SEE HIM NOW YOU KNOW THAT ONCE PETER RABBIT'S CURIOSITY IS AROUSED IT JUST HAS TO BE SATISFIED
HE WAS SO SPRY AND SLIM AND COULD SLIP THROUGH THE TALL GRASS SO FAST THAT HE COULD GO ALMOST WHERE HE PLEASED WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THIS MADE HIM VERY BOLD
HE HARDLY NOTICED THE WONDERFUL DAM OR THE EQUALLY WONDERFUL CANALS WHICH PADDY HAD MADE
SO MR SKUNK BEGAN TO GROW FAT
SO JOHNNY CHUCK SAT DOWN WHERE HE WAS WHICH WAS RIGHT WHERE GRANDFATHER FROG COULD SEE HIM BY LIFTING ONE EYELID JUST THE TEENIEST BIT AND PETER HOPPED ALONG THE BANK UNTIL HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND GRANDFATHER FROG
THAT GAVE MR RABBIT AN IDEA
PETER COULDN'T GET OVER THAT
BUT OLD MR MEADOW MOUSE WAS A FRIEND
SOMEHOW HE FELT RIGHT DOWN DEEP IN HIS HEART THAT THERE MUST BE A REASON FOR THOSE RINGS JUST AS THERE IS A REASON FOR HIS OWN LONG EARS AND LONG LEGS
HE HAD OFTEN SEEN LITTLE RIDGES LIKE THAT WITHOUT THINKING MUCH ABOUT THEM
MOTHER WEST WIND WHY STORIES BY THORNTON W
BUT NO ONE SAID ANYTHING AND AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO OL MISTAH BUZZARD EXPLAINED
IT'S LUCKY FOR SOME OF US THAT YOU ARE NOT IN HER PLACE SAID HE
AND NOW PETER HAD TO BELIEVE HIS EYES RATHER THAN HIS EARS
IT DIDN'T TAKE HER LONG TO FIND OUT HOW ALL THE LITTLE MEADOW AND FOREST PEOPLE EXCEPT MR COON HAD GRUMBLED AND BEEN DISCONTENTED AND SAID UGLY THINGS ABOUT HER FOR YOU CAN'T FOOL OLD MOTHER NATURE AND IT'S OF NO USE TO TRY
I ALMOST WISH MY GRANDFATHER A THOUSAND TIMES REMOVED HAD BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE WATER TOO HE SAID
HE HAD NO FEAR OF MR COYOTE
BUT HE KEPT RIGHT ON MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS AND KEEPING NEAT AND CHEERFUL UNTIL AT LAST OLD MOTHER NATURE ALL WORRIED AND TROUBLED CAME TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO TO STRAIGHTEN MATTERS OUT
GRANDFATHER FROG AFRAID OF A TOADSTOOL
IF YOU PLEASE HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS COMING AND WHAT I WAS COMING FOR NEVER MIND HOW I KNEW
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY SO PETER INTERRUPTED GRANDFATHER FROG PRETENDING TO BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT WHAT PETER SAID
OF COURSE HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING AND OF COURSE IT GAVE HIM A GREAT START
MOCKER 6
THE ADVENTURES OF JIMMY SKUNK 19
HE WAS AWAKENED BY HEARING VOICES OUTSIDE
WHEN PETER REACHED THE SMILING POOL HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED
YOU JUST KNOCKED THE LIFE OUT OF HIM WHEN YOU SHOOK HIM OFF THAT BRANCH MR PANTHER CAME OVER AND SNIFFED AT MR POSSUM AND TURNED HIM OVER WITH ONE PAW
THEN SHE TOLD THEM HOW GRIEVED SHE WAS TO HEAR OF ALL THE TROUBLE THERE HAD BEEN BUT THAT SHE COULDN'T WATCH OVER EACH ONE ALL THE TIME
THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES WERE RIGHT MUTTERED PETER TO HIMSELF AS OLD MAN COYOTE TROTTED AWAY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GREEN FOREST AND HE FELT A WEE BIT ASHAMED TO THINK THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO BELIEVE THEM
IT WAS SUCH A GOOD JOKE THAT OLD MR POSSUM TRIED IT ON MR WOLF AND MR FISHER AND MR FOX
IT WAS THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES OF OLD MOTHER WEST WIND WHO FIRST TOLD PETER WHO THE STRANGER WAS AND WARNED HIM TO WATCH OUT BECAUSE OLD MAN COYOTE IS JUST AS FOND OF RABBIT AS GRANNY OR REDDY FOX AND IS EVEN MORE CRAFTY AND SLY THAN THEY
IT ISN'T SAFE TO RUN AROUND ANY MORE SAID HE
YOU KNOW THAT IS THE WAY WITH YOU TO-DAY PETER RABBIT PETER NODDED
HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE MADE BY MINER THE MOLE
PROBABLY JERRY'S GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER BUILT HIS HOUSE THAT WAY AND SO JERRY DOES THE SAME THING PETER RABBIT SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED UP
BUT WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ASLEEP MR FOX USED TO STEAL OUT AND BE GONE HALF THE NIGHT
INDEED HE WAS SMART ENOUGH AND CLEVER ENOUGH NOT TO LET HIS NEIGHBORS KNOW THAT HE WAS SMART AND CLEVER AT ALL
HE SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD NO TROUBLES
HE COULDN'T BEAR TO THINK OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MR MEADOW MOUSE IF BIG MR BOB CAT SHOULD CATCH HIM
HE KNEW THAT MR HAWK WOULD NEVER COME IN THERE AND WHEN HE FOUND A LITTLE SHELF UP NEAR THE ROOF HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SAFE FROM ANY FOUR-FOOTED ENEMIES WHO MIGHT FOLLOW HIM THERE
AS HE THOUGHT AND SCHEMED
IT WAS AN UGLY GRIN TO SEE
SO HE LEARNED TO SWIM WITH ONLY HIS HEAD OUT OF WATER AND SOMETIMES WITH ONLY THE END OF HIS NOSE OUT OF WATER
IV WHY REDDY FOX WEARS RED PETER RABBIT SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH MAKING FACES AND LAUGHING AT REDDY FOX
THAT WAS A PERFECTLY SPLENDID THING FOR OLD MOTHER NATURE TO DO THEN HE STARTED FOR HIS OWN HOME IN THE DEAR OLD BRIAR-PATCH AND ALL THE WAY THERE HE WONDERED AND WONDERED HOW GRANDFATHER FROG KNEW THAT HE WANTED THAT STORY AND TO THIS DAY HE HASN'T FOUND OUT
HE CAN'T AND NONE OF HIS FAMILY CAN SAID A GRUFF VOICE
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME WHY DOES MINER THE MOLE LIVE UNDER GROUND ALL THE TIME STRIPED CHIPMUNK POINTED TO THE RIDGE MADE BY MINER
IF YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SPOTTY THE TURTLE WHY DIDN'T YOU COME EARLIER ALL THE TIME THERE WAS A TWINKLE IN THE BIG GOGGLY EYES OF GRANDFATHER FROG
MR CHIPMUNK SAW THAT HE WOULD AND THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR MR MEADOW MOUSE TO HIDE
YOU SEE HE COULDN'T THINK OF ANY EARTHLY USE HE WOULD HAVE FOR A TAIL AND SO HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HADN'T GOT ONE TO BOTHER WITH
IT'S VERY STRANGE TO ME HOW LITTLE SOME FOLKS KNOW ABOUT THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBORS HE LOOKED UP AND WINKED AT JOLLY ROUND BRIGHT MR SUN
THEN CAME THE TRYING TIME OF WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW WHEN THOSE WHO LIVED ON THE GREEN MEADOWS AND IN THE GREEN FOREST HAD THE VERY HARDEST KIND OF WORK TO FIND ENOUGH TO EAT AND WERE HUNGRY MOST OF THE TIME
OLD MR HAWK COULD FLY EVEN FASTER THAN HE AND MR HAWK WAS ALWAYS WATCHING FOR HIM
I WONDER WHO HAS DUG THIS HOLE MR MOLE REPLIED MR BADGER
BETTER TIMES COMING THE OTHERS WOULD LAUGH AT HIM FOR HIS FAITH IN OLD MOTHER NATURE AND SAY UGLY THINGS ABOUT HER AND URGE MR COON TO GO WITH THEM OUT INTO THE GREAT WORLD
OLD MOTHER NATURE IS DOING THE BEST SHE CAN
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY REDDY FOX WEARS A RED COAT CONCLUDED GRANDFATHER FROG
I SUPPOSE THERE IS A REASON FOR IT AND PROBABLY THERE IS A REASON FOR BUILDING HIS HOUSE WHERE IT IS
WHEN HE IS FEELING JUST RIGHT HE DEARLY LOVES TO TELL ABOUT THOSE LONG-AGO DAYS
BUT WHO TAUGHT HIS MAMMY PERSISTED STRIPED CHIPMUNK
AS THEY WERE ALL VERY HUNGRY THEY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN THE FEAST WOULD BE READY MY MY MY HOW ANGRY EVERYBODY GREW
OH GRANDFATHER FROG WHY IS IT THAT JIMMY SKUNK NEVER HURRIES THEY PANTED
WE'LL HUNT TOGETHER A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN IF WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING TO EAT WE'LL COME BACK AND I'LL HELP YOU DIG I HATE TO HURT MR MOLE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS BUT THESE ARE HARD TIMES AND EACH ONE MUST LOOK OUT FOR HIMSELF WITH THAT THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING MR MOLE SHAKING WITH FRIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS HOLE
THE ADVENTURES OF JOHNNY CHUCK 3
YOU MAY BE SURE SHE DOES
WAY BACK BEHIND HIM IN THE SAME LITTLE PATH WALKING VERY FAST BUT VERY QUIETLY WAS BIG MR BOB CAT
AND YOU COULDN'T HAVE BLAMED HIM
LATER HE FOUND THAT HIS NEW TAIL WAS JUST WHAT HE NEEDED TO PAT DOWN THE MUD WITH WHICH HE COVERED THE ROOF OF HIS HOUSE
HE HAD KNOWN THAT EVER SINCE HE WAS BIG ENOUGH TO BEGIN TO ASK QUESTIONS
THEREAFTER WHEN HE WANTED TO GO ON LAND HE WOULD FIRST MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE WAS WATCHING
MR COYOTE MUST HAVE A WHOLE CROWD OF BROTHERS THOUGHT HE
SHE SO SCARED SHE TIP OVER A WHOLE KETTLEFUL OF SOUP RIGHT IN THE FIRE
AND YET THE OWNERS OF SOME OF THESE PLAIN COATS ARE AMONG THE MOST HONEST AND HARD-WORKING OF ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE GREEN FOREST
I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL HE SAID
SO HE RESTED AND WHILE HE RESTED HE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT
ON THE WAY THEY MET JIMMY SKUNK AND DANNY MEADOW MOUSE
THE ADVENTURES OF POOR MRS
WHERE ELSE SHOULD I LIVE HE REPLIED
THOSE WERE VERY PEACEFUL TIMES AT FIRST AND EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BEST OF TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE AS YOU KNOW
HE JUST STARED AND STARED
I WOULD IF IT WERE MINE
WELL IT IS HIS TAIL
HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING THREE MINUTES BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE TROUBLE
IF I'D JUST MINDED MY OWN BUSINESS IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED JUST THEN HE HAPPENED TO LOOK OVER TO THE HOUSE OF MR MEADOW MOUSE
NOT AT ALL LIKE SOME PEOPLE I KNOW
SO HAD ALL THE BIRDS EXCEPT MR OWL AND MR NIGHTHAWK
YES SAH THAT IS JES WHAT THAT NO COUNT BUZZARD DO
MR BEAVER BUILT HIM A BIG COMFORTABLE HOUSE OUT IN THE POND AND THEN HE WENT TO WORK AS HARD AS EVER HE COULD TO CUT DOWN TREES AND THEN CUT THEM UP INTO THE RIGHT SIZED PIECES TO STORE AWAY IN HIS BIG FOOD PILE FOR THE WINTER
BUT IT WASN'T ENVY SO MUCH AS CURIOSITY THAT PROMPTED PETER TO TEASE FOR THAT STORY
IT WAS THE SAME WAY WITH OLD MR COON
THAT BRIGHT BLUE COAT WAS FOREVER GIVING HIM AWAY WHEN HE WAS OUT ON MISCHIEF
THE ADVENTURES OF OL MISTAH BUZZARD MOTHER WEST WIND SERIES 1
SHE JUST PASSED THE TIME OF DAY WITH HIM AND THEN SAT DOWN TO WATCH HIM CUT A TREE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE HE HAD THE GREATEST SURPRISE OF HIS LIFE
YES SIR THEY SPOILED HIS SUPPER
YOU SEE THERE WASN'T TIME TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE
I WISH I COULD FLY HI SPOTTY HE SHOUTED WHERE DO YOU LIVE THE FIRST THING PETER LOOKED TO SEE WAS WHAT KIND OF A TAIL PADDY HAS I WHY STRIPED CHIPMUNK IS PROUD OF HIS STRIPES THE MERRY LITTLE BREEZES OF OLD MOTHER WEST WIND ARE GREAT FRIENDS OF STRIPED CHIPMUNK
PROBABLY HE IS TAKING A NAP IN THAT BIG HOUSE OF HIS SAID JOHNNY CHUCK AND IF HE IS WE'LL HAVE TO SIT HERE UNTIL HE WAKES UP OR ELSE GO BACK HOME AND VISIT HIM SOME OTHER TIME THAT'S SO REPLIED PETER
NOW WHEN HE STRETCH HIS HAID AN NECK DOWN THE CHIMNEY THAT WAY HE GET EM ALL BLACK WITH SOOT
I THINK THAT HEREAFTER I WILL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH WHAT I'VE GOT AND NEVER WANT THINGS IT IS NOT MEANT THAT I SHOULD HAVE XIV WHY FLITTER THE BAT FLIES AT NIGHT ILLUSTRATION
VIII WHY OLD MAN COYOTE HAS MANY VOICES OF COURSE OLD MAN COYOTE HAS ONLY ONE VOICE BUT THAT ONE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL VOICE THAT HE CAN MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A GREAT MANY VOICES ALL YELPING AND HOWLING AND SHOUTING AND LAUGHING AT THE SAME TIME
WORSE STILL HE OVERHEARD LITTLE MR SQUIRREL AND MR POSSUM MAKING FUN OF IT
NOW IT JUST HAPPENED THAT OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD COME ALONG JUST IN TIME TO SEE AND HEAR MR COYOTE AND IT TICKLED HER SO TO THINK THAT MR COYOTE HAD BEEN SO SMART THAT WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE DID
YOU SEE NO ONE EVER HAD HEARD HIM CALLED ANYTHING BUT BUZZARD
IX WHY MINER THE MOLE LIVES UNDER GROUND STRIPED CHIPMUNK SAT STARING AT A LITTLE RIDGE WHERE THE GRASS WAS RAISED UP
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT REASON IS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG
WHEN THE HARD TIMES CAME WHICH MADE SO MANY CHANGES IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE GREEN FOREST AND ON THE GREEN MEADOWS MR SKUNK WAS VERY QUICK TO SEE THAT UNLESS HE COULD THINK OF SOME WAY TO PROTECT HIMSELF IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME WHEN HE WOULD FURNISH A DINNER FOR ONE OF HIS FIERCE BIG NEIGHBORS AND OF COURSE MR SKUNK HAD NO DESIRE TO DO THAT
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT SO HARD ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
IF HE HAD MADE HIS HOLE SMALL JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO CRAWL INTO MR BADGER AND MR FOX WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO A GREAT DEAL OF DIGGING TO MAKE IT BIG ENOUGH FOR EITHER OF THEM TO GET IN
I HAD A LONG TAIL WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I WAS MIGHTY GLAD TO GET RID OF IT AFTER HE HEARD THAT PETER FELT BETTER
WELL NOW YOU'VE ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION GRUNTED GRANDFATHER FROG
MOTHER WEST WIND HOW STORIES 7
HE WAS MORE LIKE HIS COUSINS MR WEASEL AND MR MINK
OLD MR BEAVER WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING OF ALL OF OLD MOTHER NATURE'S BIG FAMILY AND ONE OF THE SMARTEST JUST AS PADDY IS TO-DAY
HIS BAD HABITS HAD BECOME FIXED AS BAD HABITS HAVE A WAY OF DOING
AND BECAUSE HE NO LONGER HAD TO RUN FROM HIS ENEMIES HE GOT OUT OF THE HABIT OF RUNNING
